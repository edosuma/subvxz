<i>GRACE: Previously on The Secret
Life of the American Teenager...</i>

00:02.981 --> 00:04.182
I miss you. And I miss Lauren.

00:04.216 --> 00:06.150
Yeah, well, you should
have thought about how much

00:06.185 --> 00:08.820
you were going to miss us
before you slept with Jesse.

00:08.854 --> 00:10.054
Who do you hate? Madison.

00:10.089 --> 00:12.090
She...

00:12.124 --> 00:15.126
Stole my idea for a paper that we
had to write for sociology class.

00:15.160 --> 00:18.930
But now I'm forbidden to
see Dylan again, and...

00:18.964 --> 00:20.098
I am going to see Dylan again.

00:20.132 --> 00:22.066
The three of you are going
to end your friendship

00:22.101 --> 00:24.202
because you bought the
same backpack as Lauren?

00:24.236 --> 00:26.237
Well, she wanted to be
the only one that had it.

00:26.271 --> 00:28.906
You wanna have dinner,
just the two of us?

00:28.941 --> 00:30.241
<i>We haven't done that in a long time.</i>

00:30.275 --> 00:32.243
So that leaves the two of us.

00:32.277 --> 00:33.911
And your buddies.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.012
What buddies?

00:35.047 --> 00:36.080
Hi, Amy.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.182
Shut up.

00:38.217 --> 00:39.951
This isn't about a backpack?

00:39.985 --> 00:41.886
It's not about a backpack.

00:41.920 --> 00:44.155
It's not about a stolen
idea for a paper, either.

00:44.189 --> 00:45.923
That wasn't Ben's pot we were smoking.

00:45.958 --> 00:48.192
Then whose pot was it?

00:48.227 --> 00:50.027
Mercedes.

00:50.062 --> 00:52.897
Mom, what is it? Your
dad had a girlfriend.

00:52.931 --> 00:54.932
I want to know my brother and my sister.

00:54.967 --> 00:57.034
I am sure they want to
get to know you as well.

00:57.069 --> 00:58.970
But I want them to have
some time to absorb all this.

01:06.245 --> 01:08.913
Hi, there.

01:08.947 --> 01:11.048
Oh. Hi. How are you?

01:11.083 --> 01:13.217
Fine, thank you. And you?

01:14.153 --> 01:17.021
Well, I'd be better
if we weren't talking

01:17.055 --> 01:19.190
as if we were in some sort
of textbook on manners.

01:19.224 --> 01:21.993
What's up, sister?

01:22.027 --> 01:24.128
Nothing. I'm just here to meet George.

01:25.264 --> 01:27.131
Are Amy and Ricky here yet?

01:27.166 --> 01:29.033
Oh. They're not coming. I said
I'd watch the little fellas.

01:30.269 --> 01:32.870
What?

01:32.905 --> 01:35.072
Well, to be perfectly honest,

01:35.107 --> 01:37.208
I don't know how
comfortable I feel with that.

01:37.242 --> 01:40.044
I mean, Robie doesn't know
you all that well yet, and...

01:40.078 --> 01:43.247
(LAUGHS) I'm goofing on you.

01:43.282 --> 01:45.216
Ricky and Amy are coming to babysit

01:45.250 --> 01:48.019
and that's why I made little
John his favorite meal.

01:48.053 --> 01:51.989
Oh! I didn't know he
had a favorite meal.

01:52.024 --> 01:54.125
But, you know, I don't get to spend
that much time with him anymore.

01:54.159 --> 01:57.028
Well, then you should
come up here more often.

01:57.062 --> 01:58.129
Or Amy and Ricky should
bring him down more often.

01:58.163 --> 02:01.132
Or you should come up here more often.

02:01.166 --> 02:03.834
We'd all like to see you more often.

02:03.869 --> 02:05.169
What does that mean, exactly?

02:05.204 --> 02:07.171
You'd all like to see me more often.

02:07.206 --> 02:08.973
Nothing. Other than that.

02:09.007 --> 02:12.243
I mean, who, specifically, is "all"?

02:14.112 --> 02:16.113
BOTH: I was not looking at you.

02:18.083 --> 02:20.017
You know, George did this.

02:20.052 --> 02:23.054
Yeah, I was perfectly
comfortable with you, and then...

02:23.088 --> 02:27.058
I don't know, you got all comfortable
with him, and then I started thinking

02:27.092 --> 02:28.993
that you two were talking about me

02:29.027 --> 02:30.962
and whether or not I'm
gay, and I'm not gay.

02:30.996 --> 02:31.996
But I don't care about you being gay,

02:32.030 --> 02:34.899
and just for the record,
that is not the issue

02:34.933 --> 02:36.901
that I have with you taking
care of John. It's just that...

02:36.935 --> 02:40.204
That I'm an addict, or an
ex-addict, and I have a record

02:40.239 --> 02:42.974
and, oh, I was a bad mom to boot.

02:43.008 --> 02:44.208
And let's see,

02:44.243 --> 02:46.077
you're okay with my being gay.

02:46.111 --> 02:48.012
And with your not being gay. Got it.

02:50.315 --> 02:51.115
You're not looking at me?

02:51.149 --> 02:54.051
No!

02:54.086 --> 02:55.286
Are you looking at me?

02:55.320 --> 02:56.554
No, I am not looking at you, but...

02:56.588 --> 03:00.091
Not to call you a liar but I
think you are looking at me.

03:00.125 --> 03:00.258
Oh, great.

03:03.262 --> 03:05.096
I think we left some things in the car.

03:05.130 --> 03:08.032
And I think I'll help you find them.

03:10.135 --> 03:11.235
Don't look at me. Oh.

03:19.244 --> 03:20.011
(SIGHS)

03:21.280 --> 03:23.080
I'm not gay.

03:23.115 --> 03:24.181
No one said you were.

03:24.216 --> 03:26.017
What are you talking about?

03:26.051 --> 03:27.952
Your father saw me talking
to Nora a few weeks ago,

03:27.986 --> 03:31.122
just talking. And then he accused me of

03:31.156 --> 03:32.089
looking at her.

03:33.091 --> 03:34.992
That's ridiculous.

03:35.027 --> 03:38.262
He told her, she told Ricky,
and Ricky told you. I knew it.

03:38.297 --> 03:41.265
He skipped her. He told
Ricky and Ricky told me.

03:41.300 --> 03:42.033
But it's still ridiculous.

03:42.067 --> 03:45.169
Yeah, it is. But you know, um,

03:45.203 --> 03:48.105
even if it's not ridiculous,
that would be okay.

03:48.140 --> 03:51.208
What? Amy, I'm not gay.

03:53.011 --> 03:54.912
I didn't say anything.
Not to her, anyway.

03:54.946 --> 03:56.013
Ready to go?

03:56.048 --> 03:57.081
I guess.

03:57.115 --> 03:59.050
Me, too. I'm going out with Lauren.

04:00.085 --> 04:01.118
Ricky will be here.

04:01.153 --> 04:02.186
When were you going to tell us this?

04:02.220 --> 04:04.121
I don't know, why would I tell you this?

04:04.156 --> 04:06.190
Because I thought that you and
Ricky were babysitting together.

04:06.224 --> 04:08.159
You don't trust Ricky
with Robie and John?

04:10.228 --> 04:11.996
Oh. You don't trust Ricky
and Nora with Robie and John.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.966
Fine. There's no reason
not to trust Ricky.

04:17.002 --> 04:18.836
He would never let anything
happen to Robie or John,

04:18.870 --> 04:20.938
but if you don't trust
him, then maybe you should

04:20.971 --> 04:22.173
make Ashley stay home
and babysit for you.

04:22.207 --> 04:24.008
She and Toby went to look
at a community college

04:24.042 --> 04:25.109
that I asked her to look at

04:25.143 --> 04:27.878
before she goes off to Florida again.

04:27.913 --> 04:29.180
So I would really appreciate
it if you would stay here.

04:29.214 --> 04:30.214
But why?

04:30.248 --> 04:32.850
Because I asked you to

04:32.884 --> 04:34.852
and because that's what I
feel most comfortable with

04:34.886 --> 04:35.453
and because you said you would.

04:35.487 --> 04:37.154
So, Amy, do you mind?

04:37.189 --> 04:39.056
I don't care if she minds. Amy.

04:39.091 --> 04:40.157
Your mother really doesn't ask
you to do anything very often.

04:40.192 --> 04:42.093
So, you stay here with
Ricky and babysit the boys

04:42.127 --> 04:44.161
and we're going out like we planned.

04:44.196 --> 04:46.197
This is not the first time
you've asked me to babysit.

04:46.231 --> 04:49.233
Look, I don't mind suffering because
I had a baby when I shouldn't have,

04:49.267 --> 04:51.969
but I do mind suffering because you
two had a baby when you shouldn't have.

04:54.039 --> 04:55.906
It's summer!

04:55.941 --> 04:58.075
I would like to just have
one summer in high school

04:58.110 --> 04:59.009
where I don't have to be responsible
every single minute for someone else.

04:59.044 --> 05:01.112
And whose fault is that? Okay, fine.

05:01.146 --> 05:02.813
Just the three of you go out.

05:02.848 --> 05:04.882
We will be fine without your help, Amy.

05:04.916 --> 05:05.182
We certainly wouldn't want
to add to your suffering.

05:05.217 --> 05:07.885
Good.

05:10.155 --> 05:11.021
You know, everyone
thinks my life is perfect

05:11.056 --> 05:13.891
because I'm engaged and everything,

05:13.925 --> 05:16.026
but it's not. My life is not perfect.

05:16.061 --> 05:17.128
Sometimes it sucks!

No, we're not. Amy, come on,

No, I don't want and tell heren

05:56.232 --> 05:58.167
I'll meet he: some other night.

05:58.201 --> 06:01.136
There's no reason tonight
like we had planned.

06:01.171 --> 06:02.871
I don't have any homework tonight

06:02.906 --> 06:04.106
and I wanto go to the
concert in the park.

06:04.140 --> 06:07.076
Oh, come on, it's not
to that stupid concert.

06:07.110 --> 06:08.911
It's nothing. out of the house.

06:08.945 --> 06:10.045
Yes, I do want out of the house.

06:10.080 --> 06:12.081
And I was looking forward
to being out of the house

06:12.115 --> 06:15.150

too bad for them.obie,

06:15.185 --> 06:18.954
(CHUCKLES) Wow, Miss Cranky-Pants.

06:18.988 --> 06:20.089
You getting your period or something?

06:20.123 --> 06:23.025
Is that any of your business? Is it?

06:23.059 --> 06:24.093
Like you're never in a bad mood.

06:24.127 --> 06:25.127
Maybe you're getting your period.

06:26.996 --> 06:27.996
Can we go now?

06:32.268 --> 06:33.936
I knew this was going to happen.

06:36.172 --> 06:39.074
Amy wants to go out with Lauren tonight.

06:40.176 --> 06:41.944
And she doesn't want to babysit

06:41.978 --> 06:43.112
so I said I would babysit

06:43.146 --> 06:45.047
but I told her and she didn't,

06:45.081 --> 06:46.215
and now and her dad's upset

06:46.249 --> 06:47.950
and she's upset, and...

06:49.319 --> 06:52.221
(SIGHS) Great.

06:55.158 --> 06:58.160
Maybe she's feeling confined.

06:58.194 --> 06:59.995
I mean, I know the feeling.

07:00.029 --> 07:03.232
Of course, I know it
from being confined,

07:03.266 --> 07:06.068
which is why this apart, pretty much.

07:06.102 --> 07:07.870

something's up with her.

07:25.054 --> 07:26.255
Maybe it has nothing to do with you.

07:30.193 --> 07:32.060
Yeah, one would hope.

I'm not an idiot. Don't call me names.

07:37.066 --> 07:38.300
Well, you called me an ex-con.

07:38.334 --> 07:40.969
I mean, you used fancy words,
but that's what you said.

07:41.004 --> 07:42.070

okay with me staying with Robie,

and you just go do whatever you need

07:54.150 --> 07:56.018
to do tonight and pick me up later.

what I say I'm going to do.

sanctimonious on me, okay?

08:04.227 --> 08:06.929
All right. Just go on.

08:06.963 --> 08:08.230
Get out for a while.
You need to get out.

08:08.264 --> 08:10.899
What does that mean,
that I need to get out?

08:10.934 --> 08:12.234
That I'm short-tempered
and I'm a bad mother?

08:12.268 --> 08:13.936
I didn't say that.

08:13.970 --> 08:15.237
Fine. I'll get out.

08:15.271 --> 08:18.106
I deserve to get out for just
one lousy night. It's summer.

08:21.945 --> 08:25.013
Bye, John! I'll see you later.

08:26.015 --> 08:27.015
I'll be back, okay?

08:35.191 --> 08:36.958
Yeah. Mommy's funny.

08:36.993 --> 08:39.294
And a little crazy today.

08:45.134 --> 08:46.235
This is what you wanted
to talk to me about?

08:46.269 --> 08:47.970
This harebrained scheme?

08:48.004 --> 08:49.071
It's not a harebrained scheme.

08:49.105 --> 08:50.239
It's a vacation. I need a vacation.

08:50.273 --> 08:53.141
You are not taking my son
to Europe on a vacation.

08:53.176 --> 08:55.010
That's not a vacation,
traveling with Robie by yourself.

08:56.012 --> 08:57.145
I enjoy Robie.

08:57.180 --> 08:58.146
So do I, so leave him with
me and go on a vacation.

08:58.181 --> 09:00.148
No, I want to take him with me.

09:00.183 --> 09:02.117
You'd have to take all
that baby crap with you

09:02.151 --> 09:04.019
and who wants to do
that? I want to do that.

09:04.053 --> 09:05.120
You're not doing that.

09:05.154 --> 09:07.089
You can't take him out of the country.

09:07.123 --> 09:08.957
Why are you so hot to get
out of the country, anyway?

09:08.992 --> 09:09.958
Are you running away from something?

09:09.993 --> 09:11.927
Something that requires
leaving the country?

09:11.961 --> 09:13.896
Yeah. I committed a crime, George.

09:13.930 --> 09:16.064
(CHUCKLES) And I'm on the lam.

09:16.099 --> 09:17.966
That's how I came up with
this harebrained scheme.

09:18.001 --> 09:20.135
Well, don't go on the lam over there
in Europe. They hate us over there.

09:20.169 --> 09:22.938
No, they just don't like
loud, obnoxious Americans

09:22.972 --> 09:23.272
who have no interest
in any other culture.

09:23.306 --> 09:26.141
Like me?

09:26.175 --> 09:28.010
You know, we're not the only
country in the world, George.

09:28.044 --> 09:30.012
That doesn't mean you have to see
the other countries with our son.

09:30.046 --> 09:32.147
I just want to go to Paris,

09:32.181 --> 09:35.951
or maybe Milan or someplace
else. I don't know.

09:35.985 --> 09:37.920
With a baby? Yes, with Robie.

09:37.954 --> 09:41.990
He's the only family member I feel
close enough to talk to right now.

09:44.060 --> 09:47.229
I, uh, let Amy take off
and I don't have a car.

09:47.263 --> 09:49.097
I was going to hang out with John,

09:49.132 --> 09:50.966
but I guess I could
call a taxi or something.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.100
I'll take you home.

09:52.135 --> 09:54.002
Maybe I'll even take you
home and wait for Amy.

09:54.037 --> 09:54.970
I want to have a word with her.

09:55.004 --> 09:56.238
I'm sure you do,

09:56.272 --> 09:58.941
but I think whether Anne
told you she's going to Europe

09:58.975 --> 10:01.176
over dinner or right here,
you'd be just as upset, so...

10:01.210 --> 10:03.278
So, I would rather have
a big fat steak for dinner

10:03.313 --> 10:05.147
with the bad news instead
of a hotdog, all right?

10:05.181 --> 10:06.214
(CHUCKLES) All right.

10:06.249 --> 10:08.250
What is wrong with
her, anyway? With Amy.

10:08.284 --> 10:11.053
I don't know. Maybe it's just hormonal.

10:11.087 --> 10:12.955
All that stuff about periods.

10:12.989 --> 10:13.989
That's just one big old wives'
tale. Don't believe any of it.

10:14.023 --> 10:15.190
It's no excuse for any craziness.

10:15.224 --> 10:17.192
Okay, well,

10:17.226 --> 10:19.261
you mind letting me
handle this with Amy?

10:19.963 --> 10:21.096
I know she's your daughter

10:21.130 --> 10:23.131
and I know you're upset with her,

10:23.166 --> 10:25.233
but she's going to be my wife. I hope.

10:28.004 --> 10:29.938
I don't know if I want
to be a wife and a mother.

10:29.973 --> 10:31.974
I don't know if I'm ready
to be a wife and a mother.

10:32.008 --> 10:34.977
But you're already a mother.
And you're a good mother.

10:35.011 --> 10:37.946
I try, Lauren. I try.

10:37.981 --> 10:40.248
I love John, and I love Ricky
and I want to marry Ricky,

10:40.283 --> 10:42.985
but right now I just
want to have some fun.

10:43.019 --> 10:45.087
I mean, is it a crime to want to
have some fun when it's summer,

10:45.121 --> 10:46.088
the last summer we'll
ever have in high school?

10:48.091 --> 10:49.925
I miss Madison.

10:49.959 --> 10:51.259
What? Nothing.

10:55.331 --> 10:59.267
I mean, it's the summer before
my senior year of high school.

10:59.302 --> 11:01.236
I should be going to
the beach with my friends

11:01.270 --> 11:03.171
and hanging out at the mall and dating,

11:03.206 --> 11:05.007
and just having fun.

11:05.041 --> 11:06.208
(SCOFFS) Like me?

11:06.242 --> 11:07.876
Yes. Like you. And like everyone else.

11:07.910 --> 11:09.011
Are you kidding?

11:09.045 --> 11:12.047
I'm not having any fun this summer,

11:12.081 --> 11:15.150
and I don't know anyone that
is having any fun this summer.

11:15.184 --> 11:16.151
Well, except maybe Ben.

11:16.185 --> 11:18.253
Ben?

11:18.287 --> 11:21.023
Yeah. Ben's obviously in love.

11:21.057 --> 11:23.892
(CHUCKLES) With that
pothead? No, he isn't.

11:23.926 --> 11:26.895
Are you sure you're not just having
second thoughts about getting engaged?

11:26.929 --> 11:31.066
No, I'm not having second
thoughts about getting engaged.

11:31.100 --> 11:32.901
Just second thoughts
about getting married.

11:32.935 --> 11:34.169
And it's not even that, really,

11:34.203 --> 11:36.171
because I want to get married someday.

11:37.140 --> 11:39.207
I just don't want to have to get married

11:39.242 --> 11:41.143
before I'm ready to get married.

11:41.177 --> 11:44.279
You haven't felt like you had to
get married in the past two years.

11:44.313 --> 11:46.982
What makes you feel like
you have to get married now?

11:47.016 --> 11:48.216
Other than you said you would.

11:51.220 --> 11:52.120
Oh, no.

11:54.123 --> 11:55.057
I'm late.

12:01.097 --> 12:02.898
(SIGHS)

12:04.887 --> 12:04.887
+

12:06.102 --> 12:07.169
You thought it was just
gonna be the two of us?

12:07.400 --> 12:09.668
BEN: I didn't really know.

12:09.703 --> 12:12.371
But I'm happy you both would
sit down and talk to me.

12:12.405 --> 12:15.307
I'm really interested in Dylan

12:15.342 --> 12:18.511
and I think I can make a
good case for our going out,

12:18.545 --> 12:20.646
and I'm happy to present
my case to both of you,

12:20.680 --> 12:21.714
although, yes,

12:21.748 --> 12:24.483
I thought you'd be at
work this evening, sir.

12:24.518 --> 12:25.651
That's what Dylan had told me.

12:25.685 --> 12:27.653
I came home from work early.

12:27.687 --> 12:29.688
We like to double-team.

12:29.723 --> 12:31.624
We're a united force.

12:31.658 --> 12:34.627
Do you feel you really
need a united force?

12:34.661 --> 12:36.695
I mean, it's just me.

12:36.730 --> 12:38.697
I'm harmless. I promise.

12:38.732 --> 12:41.667
You're not entirely harmless
unless you've been neutered.

12:41.701 --> 12:43.702
I have not been neutered,

12:43.737 --> 12:45.504
but at this point, I might
be willing. (CHUCKLES)

12:45.539 --> 12:48.574
That doesn't really amuse me, Ben.

12:48.608 --> 12:52.378
In fact, it scares me
that you're that desperate

12:52.412 --> 12:54.680
to go out with my ughter, and
you hardly know my daughter.

12:54.714 --> 12:57.550
And we hardly know you or your family.

12:57.584 --> 12:59.518
That was a poor attempt at a joke.

12:59.553 --> 13:01.320
I sincerely apologize.

13:01.354 --> 13:02.488
And that's why I'm here.

13:02.522 --> 13:05.591
So you can get to know me.

13:05.625 --> 13:08.494
And I'm not really
desperate. I'm just...

13:08.528 --> 13:09.595
I'm smitten.

13:09.629 --> 13:10.429
Really?

13:13.366 --> 13:16.535
Here's the thing.

13:16.570 --> 13:19.572
Even considering the events of my
life over the past couple of years,

13:19.606 --> 13:21.640
or maybe especially considering

13:21.675 --> 13:25.511
the events of my life over
the past couple of years,

13:25.545 --> 13:28.480
I actually think I'm less
of a threat to your daughter

13:28.515 --> 13:30.516
than other guys she might
choose to go out with.

13:30.550 --> 13:31.650
Is this another attempt at a joke?

13:31.685 --> 13:33.485
No, not at all.

13:33.520 --> 13:35.654
And you arrived at that conclusion...

13:35.689 --> 13:37.590
I'm just interested.

13:37.624 --> 13:42.461
I've had the opportunity to
learn a lot of life lessons,

13:42.495 --> 13:43.629
the kind of life lessons
that few guys my age

13:43.663 --> 13:46.465
have had the misfortune to learn.

13:46.499 --> 13:48.367
Interesting.

13:48.401 --> 13:51.370
Although you've probably learned
a lot of life lessons about

13:51.404 --> 13:52.605
sex.

13:52.639 --> 13:55.374
And you can't unlearn those lessons.

13:55.408 --> 13:56.642
That's what worries us about you.

13:56.676 --> 13:58.677
Among other things.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.413
I have also learned that
sex has real consequences

14:01.448 --> 14:05.351
and that high school may be too early

14:05.385 --> 14:07.553
to be dealing with those consequences.

14:07.587 --> 14:12.524
And I don't want to be in a sexual
relationship again for a long, long time.

14:12.559 --> 14:16.495
And a long time would
be four or five years?

14:16.529 --> 14:19.565
At which time you might
be ready to get married?

14:19.599 --> 14:20.399
Might. Yes.

14:22.602 --> 14:24.536
I'm curious.

14:24.571 --> 14:26.372
Are your parents divorced?

14:26.406 --> 14:28.507
My mom actually passed
away a long time ago

14:28.541 --> 14:30.476
when I was in elementary school.

14:30.510 --> 14:33.612
Oh, we're so sorry to hear
that. Dylan didn't tell us.

14:33.647 --> 14:34.613
And your dad never remarried?

14:34.648 --> 14:38.417
No. Um...

14:38.451 --> 14:41.353
He actually remarried
a couple of years ago.

14:41.388 --> 14:44.356
So, where's his wife?

14:44.391 --> 14:45.491
Why haven't we met your stepmother?

14:45.525 --> 14:48.560
Uh...

14:48.595 --> 14:51.563
They're actually going through
a divorce. Not his fault.

14:51.598 --> 14:53.399
Betty is a lovely woman,

14:53.433 --> 14:55.567
but my dad waited until years
after my mom died to date again,

14:55.602 --> 15:01.273
and, well, he may not have

15:01.308 --> 15:02.374
chosen the right woman
for a lifetime commitment.

15:07.280 --> 15:11.583
Betty came from a rough background.

15:11.618 --> 15:15.220
She left school at an early
age and got mixed up with some

15:15.255 --> 15:17.389
bad boyfriend, and, well...

15:19.359 --> 15:21.327
When my dad found her she was kind of...

15:24.364 --> 15:25.564
She was just kind of in a bad place.

15:25.598 --> 15:28.434
But once they got married

15:28.468 --> 15:30.569
and she was in a better
place, she just decided

15:30.603 --> 15:33.339
she wanted to be on her own again,

15:33.373 --> 15:34.506
and go back to college
and my dad decided

15:34.541 --> 15:36.442
to help make all her dreams come true.

15:36.476 --> 15:40.312
What bad place was she
in when he found her?

15:40.347 --> 15:41.413
I beg your pardon?

15:41.448 --> 15:44.249
You said she was in a bad
place. Your stepmother.

15:45.618 --> 15:50.422
So, you've been following
me around, taking pictures.

15:50.457 --> 15:52.358
Just thought I'd like
to have some snapshots

15:52.392 --> 15:54.226
of me and my girlfriend?
Something like that?

15:54.260 --> 15:54.860
Yeah. Something like that.

15:54.894 --> 15:56.295
But not that. Not that.

15:56.329 --> 15:59.298
Betty knew I was in love
with Camille when she left me.

15:59.332 --> 16:01.433
She left me. I didn't leave her.

16:01.468 --> 16:06.372
I'm not worried about whether
you left her or she left you.

16:06.406 --> 16:10.242
I'm worried that Betty is not
receiving her fair share of

16:10.276 --> 16:12.311
Boykewich International.

16:12.345 --> 16:15.214
That was determined and agreed
to before we got married.

16:15.548 --> 16:17.449
But tell me.

16:17.484 --> 16:19.418
What do you estimate
her fair share would be?

16:19.452 --> 16:21.387
I don't know.

16:21.421 --> 16:24.289
Without looking at the
books, I'd have to guess.

16:24.324 --> 16:26.358
Take a guess. What do
you think it should be?

16:26.393 --> 16:29.328
Say two or three,

16:31.398 --> 16:33.399
four million dollars. How much?

16:33.433 --> 16:35.267
Why don't we compromise
and make it three?

16:35.301 --> 16:36.402
Three million. Yeah.

16:36.436 --> 16:39.371
And you get what percentage
of that? Percentage?

16:39.406 --> 16:41.507
Well, guys like you generally
work on a percentage, right?

16:41.541 --> 16:42.374
Right. Fifty?

16:42.409 --> 16:46.345
That's between me and my lovely client.

16:46.379 --> 16:49.515
Okay, well, I'll tell you what.

16:49.549 --> 16:52.217
I'm going to make a check
out for three million dollars.

16:52.252 --> 16:53.152
And I'm going to make
the check out to Betty.

16:53.186 --> 16:55.454
And if Betty's the woman I think she is,

16:55.488 --> 16:57.456
that I always thought she was,

16:57.490 --> 16:59.224
she's not going to cash this check

16:59.259 --> 17:01.427
and you're not going to get
a dime for all your troubles.

17:01.461 --> 17:05.230
If she cashes the check,
she cashes the check.

17:05.265 --> 17:06.432
And I'm not the judge of
character that I thought I was

17:06.465 --> 17:10.202
and she's nothing but
a prostitute after all.

17:12.000 --> 17:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:24.584 --> 17:29.354
Either way, you don't come
anywhere near me again, or Betty.

17:29.389 --> 17:31.323
I'll have the check
sent to her by messenger.

17:31.357 --> 17:33.225
And after that, I'll be watching you.

17:33.259 --> 17:35.194
If she cashes the check, you get paid.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.162
If not, you don't get paid

17:37.197 --> 17:38.163
and you crawl back into
whatever hole you crawled out of.

17:38.198 --> 17:40.299
Pleasure meeting you.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.201
Wish I could say the same. Good night.

17:47.540 --> 17:49.174
Who was that?

17:49.209 --> 17:50.509
You don't want to know.

17:50.543 --> 17:52.444
No, I do.

17:52.479 --> 17:53.479
Hey, Nate!

17:56.516 --> 17:57.583
Take this over to Betty.

17:57.617 --> 18:01.286
I talked to her earlier.
She's waiting for my call.

18:01.321 --> 18:03.188
But I'm not gonna call
her. Just take that to her.

18:03.223 --> 18:04.223
Right away, sir.

18:07.360 --> 18:08.460
Dad?

18:08.495 --> 18:12.297
All right, all right.
Betty got herself a lawyer.

18:12.332 --> 18:14.266
She's not happy with the settlement?

18:14.300 --> 18:17.136
No, he's not happy with the settlement.

18:17.170 --> 18:17.903
But I don't want to discuss it.

18:17.937 --> 18:19.471
I'm sure it's going to be fine.

18:19.506 --> 18:22.107
Yeah, sure it is.
You being a smart-ass?

18:22.142 --> 18:24.143
Dad, don't forget who Betty is.

18:24.177 --> 18:24.977
Who is she?

18:25.011 --> 18:28.447
Well, for one, she's your ex-wife.

18:28.481 --> 18:31.350
And a perfectly nice woman.

18:31.384 --> 18:33.285
What? Nothing, Dad. You're right.

18:33.319 --> 18:35.220
Betty is a perfectly nice woman.

18:35.255 --> 18:39.124
So, Dylan's parents
didn't let her go out?

18:39.159 --> 18:41.293
No. They didn't.

18:41.327 --> 18:42.361
You seemed pretty certain
you could make your case.

18:42.395 --> 18:43.428
What happened? Oh, I don't know.

18:43.463 --> 18:46.298
My case just suddenly fell apart.

18:46.332 --> 18:48.133
Well, you're a good man for trying,

18:48.168 --> 18:51.203
but, Ben,

18:51.237 --> 18:52.504
sometimes your mistakes have
a way of catching up with you.

18:52.539 --> 18:55.374
And when your friends stick
by you through your mistakes,

18:55.408 --> 18:58.343
you stick by them
through their mistakes.

18:58.378 --> 19:00.312
You're not going to
use this moment in time

19:00.346 --> 19:03.182
as an opportunity to try
to get me to call Henry.

19:03.216 --> 19:07.286
Henry is not my friend. I
thought he was, but he's not.

19:07.320 --> 19:08.453
Look. I don't want to talk about
it. I'll just say good night.

19:08.488 --> 19:10.455
Good night, then.

19:16.456 --> 19:16.456
+

19:19.893 --> 19:22.728
Where is Mom? When's
she going to get here?

19:22.763 --> 19:24.730
She missed her connecting flight

19:24.765 --> 19:25.765
and then the flight she was
connecting on was late taking off,

19:25.799 --> 19:28.534
so I think it's going to be a while.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.603
Okay, well, call me when she gets here.

19:30.637 --> 19:32.538
Wait. Why don't you wait with me?

19:32.572 --> 19:35.641
You don't want to hang out
with your little family, do you?

19:35.676 --> 19:37.576
Aren't you bored of them or
tired of them, or something?

19:37.611 --> 19:41.614
I was, but they're
going to be gone soon.

19:41.648 --> 19:42.815
Really? Really.

19:42.849 --> 19:46.519
I think someone might
be getting married.

19:46.553 --> 19:48.688
Ugh! Rachel's going to marry Milton?

19:48.722 --> 19:49.855
Milton's a great guy.

19:49.890 --> 19:52.825
No, he isn't.

19:52.859 --> 19:56.762
How would you know? You haven't
been out with a great guy since Jack.

19:58.765 --> 19:59.832
See you.

20:01.935 --> 20:02.935
See you.

20:08.942 --> 20:10.810
<i>JACK: Hey, free concert
tonight at the park.</i>

20:10.844 --> 20:12.812
<i>Be there or be square.</i>

20:12.846 --> 20:14.780
<i>If I don't pick up, I can't
hear you over the music.</i>

20:15.782 --> 20:17.883
Hey, I just thought of something.

20:17.918 --> 20:20.820
What if Mom's late

20:20.854 --> 20:24.657
because she's bringing
our brother with her?

20:24.691 --> 20:29.662
No, no, no, no, no. She is not
bringing our so-called brother with her.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.731
She's not. Believe me.

20:31.765 --> 20:32.698
She needs more time
to get used to the idea

20:32.733 --> 20:36.569
of us having a brother, and so do we.

20:36.603 --> 20:38.571
I don't. I don't need any time.

20:38.605 --> 20:39.438
Well, I do.

20:39.473 --> 20:42.742
Not going to change anything. Time.

20:42.776 --> 20:43.976
Time changes everything.

20:44.010 --> 20:48.848
It doesn't change that we have
a brother we never knew about.

20:48.882 --> 20:50.583
You know, I actually thought

20:50.617 --> 20:51.817
that I killed Dad by having sex

20:51.852 --> 20:53.786
and then I find out that every year

20:53.820 --> 20:55.921
he's going on these
missions and cheating on Mom!

20:55.956 --> 20:57.723
I mean, it makes me sick!

20:57.758 --> 21:02.595
Our brother can't
help who his father is.

21:03.630 --> 21:07.733
Call me when they get here.

21:07.768 --> 21:09.668
There's no "they." It's just Mom.

21:18.945 --> 21:19.712
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

21:22.816 --> 21:23.883
Hello? Hey.

21:23.917 --> 21:25.618
I thought you were at
the park, at the concert.

21:25.652 --> 21:28.821
No, I was just letting you
and everyone else think that.

21:28.855 --> 21:32.591
I was trying to sound as if I had
an interesting life or something.

21:32.626 --> 21:34.593
What's up?

21:34.628 --> 21:34.727
You want to have sex?

21:36.630 --> 21:37.730
I'll be right over.

21:42.769 --> 21:46.639
So much for swearing off boys.

21:46.673 --> 21:47.606
Come on, we gotta get up.

21:47.641 --> 21:47.973
Mmm. No, we don't.

21:48.008 --> 21:50.776
No, we do.

21:50.811 --> 21:52.745
I told Daniel we'd
meet them for a movie.

21:54.581 --> 21:55.714
We'd meet him and that girl?

21:55.749 --> 21:57.716
Hey, you didn't say slut this time.

21:57.751 --> 21:59.819
I knew it. You two are
gonna end up being friends.

21:59.853 --> 22:01.487
No, we're not.

22:01.521 --> 22:02.488
Okay, you're not. It doesn't matter.

22:02.522 --> 22:03.823
I told him we'd meet them.

22:03.857 --> 22:04.757
I don't want to meet them. I
didn't tell you we'd meet them.

22:04.791 --> 22:08.561
Yeah, I know. Let's go.

22:08.595 --> 22:11.497
(WHINING) But I thought
we were having a good time.

22:11.531 --> 22:12.698
We were having a good time,

22:12.732 --> 22:14.567
but we can't just stay in bed all night.

22:14.868 --> 22:16.602
Yeah, we can.

22:18.572 --> 22:19.872
Adrian, I love having sex with you,

22:19.906 --> 22:22.708
but there's got to be more to
the relationship than just sex.

22:24.678 --> 22:26.579
Okay, so,

22:26.613 --> 22:30.683
how does going to a movie with a few
friends resolve that issue for you?

22:30.717 --> 22:34.720
It's being with friends, enjoying
something other than sex together.

22:34.754 --> 22:36.722
Well, we can go out and be with friends

22:36.756 --> 22:38.724
and enjoy other things
besides sex together,

22:38.758 --> 22:40.860
but it's really all about the sex.

22:40.894 --> 22:43.529
(CHUCKLES)

22:43.563 --> 22:46.565
Okay, well, if you want a relationship
to last more than a year or two,

22:46.600 --> 22:47.666
you're going to have to get
interested in something other than sex.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.638
Hey, I know what.

22:52.672 --> 22:54.607
Maybe we should go down to the park,

22:54.641 --> 22:56.575
take your mind off things

22:56.610 --> 22:58.510
and maybe then something will happen.

22:58.545 --> 22:59.845
Maybe you are just late.

22:59.880 --> 23:04.683
Maybe you need to get up
and move around or something.

23:04.718 --> 23:07.620
You know? Get your
mind off things, relax.

23:07.654 --> 23:09.688
How can I relax?

23:09.723 --> 23:11.724
I don't know, Amy. How can
you possibly be pregnant again?

23:11.758 --> 23:13.659
I'll tell you how, Lauren.

23:13.693 --> 23:16.795
Once we got engaged, Mr. Ricky
decides that he'll stop using condoms

23:16.830 --> 23:18.764
because, after all, we're engaged,

23:18.798 --> 23:22.635
we're getting marrie and I'm
on birth control pills anyways.

23:22.669 --> 23:25.638
We've always used condoms, except
for that one time at band camp,

23:25.672 --> 23:28.741
so I thought it might be
nice not to use condoms,

23:28.775 --> 23:31.644
so we haven't been using condoms.

23:31.678 --> 23:32.645
Well, that was stupid.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.581
I'm sorry.

23:37.717 --> 23:42.655
We're friends. We're best friends,

23:42.689 --> 23:44.723
so maybe I shouldn't have said that.

23:44.758 --> 23:47.593
But, Amy, you're engaged to Ricky,

23:47.627 --> 23:50.629
and he is going to be
your husband someday.

23:50.664 --> 23:54.700
And he is the father of
your baby, or maybe babies,

23:54.734 --> 23:57.836
so maybe you're talking
to the wrong person.

23:57.871 --> 23:58.704
Maybe you shouldn't be talking to me.

23:58.738 --> 24:01.774
Maybe you should be talking to him.

24:01.808 --> 24:02.775
No, I do not want to talk to him.

24:02.809 --> 24:06.812
No, Amy, this time you can't wait.

24:06.846 --> 24:08.847
This time you're gonna
have to talk to him.

24:13.228 --> 24:13.228
+

24:14.409 --> 24:17.012
Why do you have to give him
a reason for going? Can't you just go?

24:17.266 --> 24:19.612
What, take Rubby out of the
state with his promision?

24:19.903 --> 24:20.937
I don't think so.

24:20.971 --> 24:23.005
Do you have a reason for going?

24:23.040 --> 24:26.042
(SIGHS) Not a good reason, no.

24:26.076 --> 24:27.944
I just want to go.

24:27.978 --> 24:30.747
But of coue, George thinks I'm
running away from something.

24:32.049 --> 24:33.883
Something like...

24:34.017 --> 24:37.687
Probably something like

24:38.856 --> 24:41.691
being gay.

24:41.725 --> 24:42.725
He's going to come home, see us talking

24:42.760 --> 24:44.894
and go right back to that.

24:44.928 --> 24:47.697
And you're not gay.

24:47.731 --> 24:49.665
You know, the more times
you say you're not gay...

24:49.700 --> 24:50.800
I'm not gay! Oh. Okay.

24:53.036 --> 24:54.937
All righty.

24:54.972 --> 24:59.675
Uh, well, I'll just be
getting Ricky and John

24:59.710 --> 25:00.910
and going home. Where are they?

25:00.944 --> 25:02.812
Your dad took them home hours ago.

25:02.846 --> 25:04.714
I think he's still over
there at your apartment.

25:04.748 --> 25:05.948
Yeah, hours ago.

25:05.983 --> 25:07.750
Because, you know, we
didn't end up going out.

25:07.785 --> 25:10.019
We got in a big fight

25:10.053 --> 25:12.955
and I came back here, too. To apologize.

25:12.990 --> 25:15.825
But your father's not
here. He's with Ricky.

25:15.859 --> 25:18.027
Yeah. Um, I'm sorry about
before. I'm just having a bad day.

25:18.061 --> 25:19.962
So everyone else is supposed
to have a bad day, too?

25:19.997 --> 25:23.833
Um, no.

25:23.867 --> 25:25.701
And I don't want to make it any worse,

25:25.736 --> 25:27.904
so I'm just going to go now.

25:28.939 --> 25:32.008
And I'm really sorry about before.

25:32.042 --> 25:33.876
Really, I should have
just stayed and helped out.

25:33.911 --> 25:36.712
Sorry. Good night. Is something wrong?

25:36.747 --> 25:39.682
Something we want to know about?

25:39.716 --> 25:40.850
I want to know. You don't want to know.

25:40.884 --> 25:44.821
Nothing's wrong. Good night.

25:44.855 --> 25:46.022
Why don't I want to know?
Do you know something?

25:46.056 --> 25:48.724
Why do you know everything
and I don't know anything?

25:48.759 --> 25:50.860
(CHUCKLES) That's funny.

25:50.894 --> 25:51.861
George said you're like that,

25:51.895 --> 25:53.830
always thinking you're out of the loop,

25:55.866 --> 25:57.700
but I don't know anything, really.

25:57.734 --> 25:59.936
Ricky thinks Amy's
either feeling confined

25:59.970 --> 26:02.839
or it's something hormonal.

26:02.873 --> 26:04.640
And why don't I know that?

26:04.675 --> 26:05.842
I don't know, Anne.

26:05.876 --> 26:08.978
I talk to my son. He
likes talking to me.

26:10.848 --> 26:12.849
Everyone likes talking to me.

26:13.717 --> 26:16.953
Even you.

26:16.987 --> 26:21.824
Could be some sort of
mid-life crisis, you know,

26:21.859 --> 26:24.827
reevaluating who you are and
what you really want out of life.

26:24.862 --> 26:26.662
What could?

26:26.697 --> 26:28.731
Thinking you might be gay.

26:28.765 --> 26:30.967
I think that I'm a little bit young
to be having a mid-life crisis.

26:31.001 --> 26:33.636
And I am not thinking I'm gay.

26:34.771 --> 26:35.938
Okay.

26:39.910 --> 26:41.711
Sorry, but you are
definitely looking at me.

26:44.615 --> 26:45.515
And so in protecting myself

26:45.549 --> 26:48.684
when I didn't have anyone to protect me,

26:48.719 --> 26:52.622
I think I came to be
slightly confrontational,

26:52.656 --> 26:53.689
and that might be a good
quality for a lawyer.

26:53.724 --> 26:56.692
I mean, I like to argue

26:56.727 --> 26:58.828
and I'm a pretty good liar

26:58.862 --> 27:01.764
and I have no problem making
a case for what I believe in...

27:01.798 --> 27:02.865
I'm still talking.

27:04.067 --> 27:07.937
Keep talking. I love hearing
you talk about yourself.

27:07.971 --> 27:08.938
(SCOFFS)

27:08.972 --> 27:11.974
Well, that's a line
if I've ever heard one.

27:12.009 --> 27:14.710
(CHUCKLES)

27:14.745 --> 27:17.747
All right, Counselor, if
what you want is the truth

27:17.781 --> 27:19.882
and nothing but the truth,

27:19.917 --> 27:21.984
it just turned me on that you
really can have a conversation

27:22.019 --> 27:24.720
about something other than sex.

27:24.755 --> 27:25.888
I like hearing you talk

27:25.923 --> 27:27.823
and I like knowing that
you're serious about school

27:27.858 --> 27:28.824
and about studying.

27:28.859 --> 27:31.894
It just makes you all the sexier.

27:33.697 --> 27:34.897
Really? Really, Adrian.

27:34.932 --> 27:36.666
Okay.

27:36.700 --> 27:40.770
So, anyway, when I met my father

27:40.804 --> 27:44.707
and I realized he was a
prosecutor, I couldn't believe it.

27:44.741 --> 27:46.709
I mean, maybe it's genetic,

27:46.743 --> 27:47.944
maybe it's just in my blood.

27:47.978 --> 27:50.680
Could be. It's something that you

27:50.714 --> 27:53.649
were interested in before
you found out who he is.

27:53.684 --> 27:55.818
So you're talking, too?

27:55.852 --> 27:57.687
'Cause I already find you sexy.

27:58.722 --> 27:59.789
Go ahead.

27:59.823 --> 28:02.692
I haven't talked to a
guy like this since...

28:02.726 --> 28:04.961
Never mind. Where was I?

28:09.933 --> 28:11.801
Hey.

28:11.835 --> 28:12.902
What took you so long?

28:12.936 --> 28:14.770
I had to stop by the drugstore.

28:14.805 --> 28:16.872
You didn't have to stop by the
drugstore. I have protection.

28:16.907 --> 28:19.675
I prefer to use my own
brand and not someone else's.

28:20.944 --> 28:22.812
Are you sure about this?

28:22.846 --> 28:24.647
No. I'm sorry!

28:24.681 --> 28:26.849
I wasn't even really
sure when I called you.

28:26.883 --> 28:28.951
The only thing I'm sure of
now is that we shouldn't do it.

28:28.986 --> 28:30.886
We really shouldn't do it. What?

28:30.921 --> 28:33.556
I know, I was... I was angry.

28:33.590 --> 28:34.457
I started thinking about
it, and I realized that

28:34.491 --> 28:36.626
I was angry the first time we did it.

28:36.660 --> 28:37.426
I was angry at my dad then

28:37.461 --> 28:38.894
and I'm just angry at my dad now

28:38.929 --> 28:40.863
and I think that's the reason why
I wanted to have sex with you again,

28:40.897 --> 28:41.831
and the more I thought about it,

28:41.865 --> 28:44.667
it's just not a good reason at all.

28:44.701 --> 28:45.935
Yeah, I thought you might
be angry with your dad.

28:46.703 --> 28:47.903
We weren't supposed to say anything.

28:47.938 --> 28:49.772
Your mom really shouldn't have told Tom.

28:49.806 --> 28:51.874
Yeah, tell me about it.

28:53.777 --> 28:56.646
I'm sure you must be really upset.

28:56.680 --> 28:58.948
Maybe we should go
upstairs and talk about it.

28:58.982 --> 29:02.718
You're probably exhausted
and it's getting late.

29:02.753 --> 29:04.720
That's completely and totally lame.

29:05.722 --> 29:07.923
I know. I know.

29:07.958 --> 29:09.859
I'm sorry. I should have
just called you back.

29:09.893 --> 29:11.861
No, it's all right. I
can handle disappointment.

29:12.629 --> 29:14.997
I can. If I have to.

29:15.966 --> 29:17.900
You have to. All right.

29:17.934 --> 29:19.669
Do you want me to wait here with you?

29:19.703 --> 29:20.703
I would love it if
you wait here with me.

29:20.737 --> 29:22.805
So, is your brother
coming back with your mom?

29:22.839 --> 29:23.906
She said he wasn't.

29:23.940 --> 29:25.708
Then I'm sure he's not.

29:25.742 --> 29:27.643
I'm not sure. I'm not
sure about anything.

29:27.678 --> 29:29.879
That's good. Confusion is good.

29:29.913 --> 29:30.880
Sometimes. When?

29:30.914 --> 29:32.782
When a guy is trying
to get a girl into bed.

29:34.951 --> 29:38.754
Friends?

29:38.789 --> 29:40.823
We keep saying we'll be friends,

29:40.857 --> 29:41.891
but I don't know if that's possible.

29:43.794 --> 29:44.827
Maybe. Maybe.

29:45.762 --> 29:46.896
Someday.

29:46.930 --> 29:49.832
Yeah, Grace. Someday.

29:49.866 --> 29:51.701
But I'd still always
want to have sex with you.

29:53.937 --> 29:55.738
WENDY: Knock knock.

29:55.772 --> 29:57.707
Hi. I hope you don't mind if we drop by,

29:57.741 --> 30:00.943
King Boykewich.

30:00.977 --> 30:02.978
Feel free to call me Mister.

30:03.013 --> 30:05.815
Mr. Boykewich, we came over

30:05.849 --> 30:08.017
because Dylan can't come over

30:08.051 --> 30:10.853
and she really wanted us to talk to you

30:10.887 --> 30:13.923
and we didn't have a number for you

30:13.957 --> 30:17.993
but, of course, we already
know where you live.

30:18.028 --> 30:18.928
Yes, you do.

30:18.962 --> 30:22.064
What'd she want you to talk to me about?

30:22.099 --> 30:23.999
I said Ben could go out with her.

30:24.034 --> 30:25.968
Her parents won't let
her go out with Ben.

30:26.002 --> 30:29.071
You were, uh,

30:29.106 --> 30:31.741
married to a hooker? I beg your pardon?

30:31.775 --> 30:34.877
Apparently, that's where the
talks fell apart tonight with...

30:34.911 --> 30:36.679
Pudding Pop.

30:36.713 --> 30:38.647
He couldn't believe you
were married to a hooker.

30:38.682 --> 30:39.048
They couldn't. But mostly him.

30:39.082 --> 30:41.751
Pudding Pop?

30:41.785 --> 30:44.820
We sometimes have nicknames
for people we love.

30:44.855 --> 30:46.989
Like you, King! I am the King.

30:47.023 --> 30:49.725
Oh, I knew we could make you say it.

30:50.827 --> 30:51.961
Sorry, but...

30:52.996 --> 30:55.664
Well,

30:55.699 --> 30:57.867
I think everyone knows
that as scary as you are,

30:57.901 --> 31:02.705
you're really nice.
Just like Dylan's dad.

31:02.739 --> 31:03.706
And that's why she's so sure

31:03.740 --> 31:06.842
that you and her parents
can work something out.

31:06.877 --> 31:08.978
Look, I don't know

31:09.012 --> 31:11.046
where Mr. Pudding Pop
heard that I was married

31:11.081 --> 31:13.949
to someone who was like that,

31:13.984 --> 31:15.985
but it's really none of his business.

31:16.019 --> 31:18.888
Um, Ben made it their
business. He told them.

31:18.922 --> 31:20.990
They're very good at interrogation.

31:21.024 --> 31:22.858
That's probably why
Dylan is so good at lying.

31:22.893 --> 31:23.959
That's good to know.

31:23.994 --> 31:25.694
He has a personal
security company, you know.

31:25.729 --> 31:27.830
I'm aware.

31:27.864 --> 31:29.999
Well, thanks for stopping by.

31:30.033 --> 31:32.034
Ben's friends are welcome here any time.

31:32.068 --> 31:35.638
Just about any time. Just not right now.

31:35.672 --> 31:36.572
Thank you for seeing us.

31:36.606 --> 31:37.807
Yeah, thank you. We
really appreciate it.

31:37.841 --> 31:41.677
Before we go, I'd just like to say that

31:41.711 --> 31:43.979
we think Ben is really nice

31:44.014 --> 31:46.649
and Dylan is crazy over him

31:46.683 --> 31:47.483
and she's our really best friend

31:47.517 --> 31:49.018
and we would do anything for her,

31:49.052 --> 31:51.821
including stupid stuff like this.

31:51.855 --> 31:53.889
And stupid stuff like smoking pot.

31:53.924 --> 31:54.957
BOTH: Good night.

31:58.061 --> 31:59.061
(SIGHS)

32:05.802 --> 32:06.936
Is Dylan here?

32:06.970 --> 32:08.938
Did she just leave? Is she
here? Whose car is that?

32:08.972 --> 32:10.906
She's not here. Her friends were here.

32:10.941 --> 32:14.043
You told her parents I was
married to a prostitute?

32:14.077 --> 32:17.980
I said Betty was forced into a
life of Internet prostitution,

32:18.014 --> 32:20.015
but is a very nice woman,

32:20.050 --> 32:22.852
a woman who wants to go back and
reclaim those years that she lost

32:22.886 --> 32:24.720
when she would have gone to college

32:24.754 --> 32:25.921
by going to college.

32:25.956 --> 32:29.825
Look, people just don't understand, Dad.

32:29.860 --> 32:31.727
We know Betty, but they don't know Betty

32:31.761 --> 32:35.764
and we may not care about
who she is or what she's done

32:35.799 --> 32:36.832
but it just doesn't sound that good.

32:38.768 --> 32:40.803
So, look, I'm sorry.

32:40.837 --> 32:42.638
I meant no disrespect to Betty.

32:42.672 --> 32:43.939
And you know what,

32:43.974 --> 32:47.743
I'm sure Dylan's dad isn't
exactly perfect himself. He's...

32:47.777 --> 32:50.813
He's a... He's a Pudding Pop.

32:50.847 --> 32:53.649
And you know what, if we're
not good enough for them, son,

32:53.683 --> 32:54.984
then they're not good enough for us.

32:55.018 --> 32:56.685
You and I are decent people.

32:56.720 --> 32:57.853
And you know what? So is Betty.

33:00.056 --> 33:02.791
Or at least I hope she is.

33:02.826 --> 33:03.826
I really hope she is.

33:07.864 --> 33:08.797
Did you say Pudding Pop?

33:18.041 --> 33:19.041
(DOOR OPENING)

33:20.010 --> 33:20.776
Mmm.

33:24.781 --> 33:25.714
Sorry I'm late.

33:25.749 --> 33:27.883
Yeah, about time you
got home, young lady.

33:27.918 --> 33:28.984
What time is it, anyway?

33:29.019 --> 33:29.852
Sorry, Dad, for causing problems

33:29.886 --> 33:33.722
at home tonight with you and Mom.

33:33.757 --> 33:36.892
And I would like to offer to babysit
at any other time that you need me.

33:36.927 --> 33:39.828
I guess you two can deal with whatever
it is that we're dealing with here.

33:40.830 --> 33:41.730
You could be right.

33:42.899 --> 33:45.701
Night, Amy. Mom's at home.

33:45.735 --> 33:46.635
She's waiting for you.

33:46.670 --> 33:48.904
She is? Yeah.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.005
Why the hell didn't she call me?

33:50.040 --> 33:50.706
I don't know. She's just
hanging out with Nora.

33:52.842 --> 33:54.944
Aren't you going to
say, "She's not gay"?

33:56.913 --> 33:57.813
Night.

34:01.685 --> 34:04.053
I'm glad you're home. Are you okay?

34:05.889 --> 34:08.824
Yeah. I guess you could say that.

34:08.858 --> 34:10.926
What were you right about?

34:10.960 --> 34:13.696
No, if I say it, you're just
going to get upset with me again.

34:13.730 --> 34:15.797
I know I've been a little moody tonight.

34:18.768 --> 34:19.935
(SIGHS)

34:19.969 --> 34:22.670
I'm just really tirednd...

34:23.706 --> 34:25.975
I've got school tomorrow.

34:26.009 --> 34:30.913
And you're crying about
that? About school?

34:30.947 --> 34:32.014
Geez, Amy, if summer school
is so upsetting to you,

34:32.047 --> 34:34.683
then just drop out.

34:34.951 --> 34:37.753
What is it?

34:37.786 --> 34:39.588
You just don't want to
admit that you were ong

34:39.621 --> 34:40.688
and it wasn't the best idea?

34:40.724 --> 34:42.623
No, no, that's not it.

34:42.659 --> 34:44.860
I just need to get some sleep.

34:44.893 --> 34:47.929
All right. Then get some sleep.

34:47.964 --> 34:50.565
I'm going to go see John
and get ready for bed.

34:50.600 --> 34:51.632
Okay.

34:55.739 --> 35:06.915
(SIGHS)

35:06.950 --> 35:07.716
Amy!

35:13.957 --> 35:15.858
You're not...

35:17.627 --> 35:18.627
I'm late.

35:30.846 --> 35:30.846
+

35:43.709 --> 35:45.810
Where the hell have you been?

35:45.844 --> 35:47.912
You can't talk to me like
that. You're not my wife.

35:47.947 --> 35:49.847
But maybe you could be my wife's wife.

35:49.882 --> 35:51.783
Shut up. I don't want
to be anyone's wife.

35:51.817 --> 35:53.651
Especially your wife's wife.

35:53.686 --> 35:55.887
She's in my room. Ashley's in her room.

35:55.921 --> 35:58.790
You're in your room and
I'm here. Good night.

35:58.824 --> 36:00.758
Come on!

36:00.793 --> 36:02.827
How was your evening? Fine.

36:02.861 --> 36:03.928
My evening was fine.
And how was your evening?

36:03.963 --> 36:05.997
Boring as hell.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.666
Anything happen? Anything
like what, George?

36:08.701 --> 36:11.703
I know what I saw.

36:11.737 --> 36:14.005
Oh, you poor man. You saw
nothing. You know nothing.

36:14.039 --> 36:15.673
So why's Anne running away?

36:15.708 --> 36:17.709
Because she just wants
to go on a vacation.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.744
With a baby. With your baby.

36:20.846 --> 36:21.713
Okay, you need to get some sleep.

36:21.747 --> 36:24.882
And you should encourage Anne

36:24.917 --> 36:27.785
to take a little break, go on a
vacation wherever she wants to go.

36:27.820 --> 36:31.756
She's a nice woman. She's a
tired woman. She deserves a break.

36:31.790 --> 36:32.624
So, you like her.

36:32.658 --> 36:33.958
Get out.

36:39.031 --> 36:39.764
Oh!

36:41.700 --> 36:42.834
No.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.637
No. No, no, no.

36:45.671 --> 36:47.739
Forget what I said. Say
nothing to him. Go back to bed.

36:47.773 --> 36:49.874
You think? I know.

36:49.908 --> 36:50.942
Good night.

36:53.846 --> 36:57.682
And if I don't see you before
you leave, have a great trip.

36:57.716 --> 36:58.850
Thanks, Nora.

36:59.785 --> 37:00.718

Hi, Betty.It's kind o.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.960
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.

37:44.797 --> 37:46.564
Do you have company?

37:46.598 --> 37:48.599
I do not have company, no.
But tomorrow is a workday.

37:48.634 --> 37:53.571
I just wanted to come by and
thank you in person for the check.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.607
Oh. Oh, Leo.

37:56.642 --> 38:00.845
You've made me so happy,
you know, to just do that.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.847
You know, write a check like that,

38:02.881 --> 38:04.816
you know, after all
that you've done for me.

38:05.851 --> 38:09.587
I mean, you completely
turned my life around

38:09.621 --> 38:12.790
and I just want you to know
that I'm spending the summer

38:12.825 --> 38:13.891
getting my place settled

38:13.926 --> 38:16.761
and I'm all registered
for the new fall semester

38:20.766 --> 38:22.633
and I'm going to take a little vacation

38:22.668 --> 38:25.636
down to Daytona Beach with my sisters.

38:25.904 --> 38:29.640
And I just have such a
wonderful life because of you.

38:29.675 --> 38:31.576
Uh-huh. And?

38:31.610 --> 38:36.848
Besides all the material
stuff that you've given me,

38:36.882 --> 38:40.752
you've also given me a reason
to feel really good about myself.

38:40.786 --> 38:43.755
How's that? Oh, Leo, come on.

38:43.789 --> 38:45.690
You know I was just testing you, right?

38:46.892 --> 38:48.760
You know, I just really
wanted to see if you

38:48.794 --> 38:51.896
thought as much of me as you claim to.

38:51.930 --> 38:52.930
What?

38:55.701 --> 38:56.968
I want you to take your check back.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.872
You want to know why?

39:00.906 --> 39:02.840
Why? Because you didn't sign it.

39:04.943 --> 39:07.945
And you knew that I would catch that.

39:07.980 --> 39:09.947
It's because I'm so smart. (CHUCKLING)

39:11.984 --> 39:13.918
I'm just kidding.

39:15.954 --> 39:17.955
That's funny.

39:17.990 --> 39:19.957
You always did have a
great sense of humor.

39:19.992 --> 39:22.894
I always thought
you're a very nice lady.

39:22.928 --> 39:24.996
Aw.

39:26.732 --> 39:27.665
Thank you, Leo.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.901
Good night.

39:34.873 --> 39:37.909
Maybe I'll see you around campus.

Hope so.

This better not be you, Ben Boykewich,
calling at this time of night.

40:10.943 --> 40:12.944
It's not Ben. It's me, Leo Boykewich.

40:12.978 --> 40:15.012
And I got news for you, Mr. Pudding Pop.

40:15.047 --> 40:16.747
My ex-wife is not a prostitute.

40:23.789 --> 40:24.856
Dad, was that Ben?

40:25.824 --> 40:27.792
Dad, you didn't hang up on him, did you?

40:27.826 --> 40:30.661
How does Mr. Boykewich know
that your little friends

40:30.696 --> 40:32.730
call me Pudding Pop?

40:32.764 --> 40:34.699
I don't know. I guess Ben told them.

40:34.733 --> 40:35.867
Are you sure your
friends didn't tell him?

40:35.901 --> 40:37.869
Well, I can't be completely sure, no.

40:37.903 --> 40:41.639
You can't go out with
this guy, Dylan, you can't!

40:41.673 --> 40:45.643
He got a girl pregnant.
He's getting a divorce.

40:45.677 --> 40:48.779
His dad was married to a woman
who used to be a prostitute.

40:48.814 --> 40:50.882
Well, it sounds bad when
you put it like that.

40:50.916 --> 40:52.917
But Ben is...

40:54.786 --> 40:57.889
The kind of guy who likes people

40:57.923 --> 41:00.791
and thinks people are
nice and that life is good.

41:00.826 --> 41:03.861
And he's kind and considerate.

41:03.896 --> 41:05.897
And he's cute and he's funny.

41:05.931 --> 41:10.701
And he tries to do the
right thing. He really does.

41:10.736 --> 41:13.905
And so does his dad. Mr.
Boykewich is a nice man.

41:13.939 --> 41:15.773
Can't you see that?

41:15.807 --> 41:17.775
Can't you look past the
facts for once and see that?

41:19.978 --> 41:21.946
Pudding Pop?

41:27.853 --> 41:28.953
I got it.

41:30.789 --> 41:31.856
Where did you go?

41:31.890 --> 41:32.990
You could have gotten that
at the gas station, silly.

41:33.025 --> 41:36.627
Silly? Like I would go
somewhere in the neighborhood

41:36.662 --> 41:39.630
where people might see me
and rumors would start flying

41:39.665 --> 41:42.667
and it would be all over
school by noon tomorrow?

41:42.701 --> 41:44.936
Thank you for caring so
much about me. And us.

41:46.638 --> 41:47.738
Oh, I don't need it.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.740
What? Everything's fine.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.810
You...

41:52.844 --> 41:53.878
(SIGHS) Yeah. I guess I
was just a little late.

41:56.748 --> 41:58.883
And I was probably just a little anxious

41:58.917 --> 42:00.685
since you made that idiotic suggestion

42:00.719 --> 42:01.719
that we could do without the condoms.

42:01.753 --> 42:03.988
Shouldn't we be able to
do without the condoms?

42:04.022 --> 42:06.657
What if my birth control
fails for some reason?

42:06.692 --> 42:08.793
Yeah, what if. You're right.

42:08.827 --> 42:10.795
We should take every
precaution we can take.

42:10.829 --> 42:12.063
Because I do not want any more children

42:12.097 --> 42:14.932
before we get married and
we're ready for more children.

42:14.967 --> 42:16.667
Can I get you some ice cream?

42:16.702 --> 42:17.468
(LAUGHS) Is that your way of saying

42:17.502 --> 42:18.970
you don't want any more children?

42:19.004 --> 42:20.738
I don't know.

42:20.772 --> 42:21.806
One is fine with me.

42:21.840 --> 42:22.740
Me, too.

42:25.010 --> 42:26.944
Love you. I love you, too.

42:48.667 --> 42:49.700
Nice to meet you, Grace.

42:54.873 --> 42:56.007
I'll be at Adrian's.
