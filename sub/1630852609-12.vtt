WEBVTT

00:01.068 --> 00:03.237
This is not RuPaul's
Best Friend Race.

00:03.237 --> 00:04.771
I feel very attacked!

00:04.771 --> 00:07.808
If you don't have star quality,
get the fuck outta here.

00:07.808 --> 00:10.544
Oh, my God.

00:10.544 --> 00:14.348
RuPaul: This is Untucked,
backstage at the competition

00:14.348 --> 00:18.352
to become America's
next drag superstar.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.254
Girl, if you're not watching
Untucked,

00:20.254 --> 00:22.923
you're only getting
half the story.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.593
All right, ladies.

00:26.593 --> 00:29.563
While you untuck
in the werkroom,

00:29.563 --> 00:32.699
the judges and I
will deliberate.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.301
You may leave the stage.

00:44.745 --> 00:47.281
I'm feeling kind of
on top of the world right now.

00:47.281 --> 00:50.617
I'm feeling like
I turned a situation

00:50.617 --> 00:52.653
that I did not want
completely on its head,

00:52.653 --> 00:55.622
and I feel great that
I was able to kind of

00:55.622 --> 01:00.661
make lemonade
out of lemons, darling.

01:00.661 --> 01:03.597
Girl, I thought
I did the damn thing.

01:03.597 --> 01:05.799
Jorgeous is a performer,
you know.

01:05.799 --> 01:08.268
so to hear that I was
just hiding in the background,

01:08.268 --> 01:12.973
oh, my God,
it's just so frustrating.

01:12.973 --> 01:15.075
I know I'm in the bottom,

01:15.075 --> 01:18.946
but really, I feel like
I kicked ass in that challenge.

01:18.946 --> 01:22.115
I am not thrown off.

01:22.115 --> 01:24.818
There's not a part of me
that doesn't think

01:24.818 --> 01:26.286
I'm not making it to the end.

01:27.654 --> 01:30.190
Re-po Untucked cameras
to the werkroom.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.094
-Oh, my goodness. bitch.
-Oh, bitch.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.929
Okay, girl.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.464
Bitch, that was a lot.

01:37.464 --> 01:40.434
I knew that day.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.169
I knew it was gonna come.

01:42.169 --> 01:43.603
Oh, my God.

01:43.603 --> 01:46.173
So, um...

01:46.173 --> 01:47.374
How you feeling?

01:47.374 --> 01:49.609
A bit deflated.

01:49.609 --> 01:53.146
After that big question
that we all know was coming,

01:53.146 --> 01:56.316
I mean, pretty much
everybody said Bosco,

01:56.316 --> 01:59.486
so it's gonna be
a little tense in here, girl.

01:59.486 --> 02:02.956
I really am surprised
to be in the bottom.

02:02.956 --> 02:06.927
I thought I fucking
did the damn thing.

02:06.927 --> 02:09.196
I knew every single line.

02:09.196 --> 02:12.099
I thought that I had applied
every note that I was given,

02:12.099 --> 02:15.502
and really, really brought it.

02:15.502 --> 02:19.506
As for the whole last bit,
no tea, you had to name a name.

02:19.506 --> 02:23.710
RuPaul asked us the question
who should go home.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.812
Who should go home tonight
and why?

02:25.812 --> 02:27.080
I'd have to say Bosco.

02:27.080 --> 02:28.482
I am gonna say Bosco.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.183
-I have to say Bosco.
-Bosco.

02:30.183 --> 02:31.385
-Bosco.
-Bosco.

02:31.385 --> 02:33.587
There's no cute way
to get out of this.

02:33.587 --> 02:34.955
I'm not mad.

02:34.955 --> 02:36.390
You had to do
what you had to do.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.658
I felt like
I did a fucking great job.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.828
I do wanna, like, go through
kind of quickly with y'all,

02:41.828 --> 02:43.997
because it seems like
it's pretty apparent

02:43.997 --> 02:45.565
that I'm going
to be in the bottom,

02:45.565 --> 02:47.768
and I'm going to
familiarize myself

02:47.768 --> 02:49.536
with the work
of Whitney Houston.

02:49.536 --> 02:52.506
But, yeah, I'll wait
for y'all's rebuttal

02:52.506 --> 02:53.874
before I run off.

02:53.874 --> 02:55.509
Bitch, that was
so uncomfortable,

02:55.509 --> 02:57.544
but I think we all knew
it was coming one day,

02:57.544 --> 03:00.280
and I feel like everybody here
is amazing.

03:00.280 --> 03:02.716
Definitely you know how much,
like, I live for you.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.851
It wasn't, you know,
nothing personal.

03:04.851 --> 03:06.420
And I know you know that,
but making sure we're--

03:06.420 --> 03:09.089
Yeah, just name a name.
You gotta name a name.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.224
I wanna second that,

03:11.224 --> 03:12.526
because you know I fucking
live for you, bitch.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.828
Like, I love you,
I'm obsessed with you,

03:14.828 --> 03:17.898
and I hope you don't
take offense to my answer.

03:17.898 --> 03:19.999
-Just your breath.
-Just my breath,

03:19.999 --> 03:22.169
which I completely understand.

03:22.169 --> 03:26.039
I said you because when
we were picking the parts,

03:26.039 --> 03:29.443
you were kind of, like,
a little snippy towards Camden.

03:29.443 --> 03:33.046
Honestly, girl, it did not,
like, sit right with me.

03:33.046 --> 03:36.817
I'm not taking it as a personal
attack from the other queens,

03:36.817 --> 03:38.418
but it does sting to hear

03:38.418 --> 03:40.520
that you're, like,
being dismissed

03:40.520 --> 03:42.189
by all of your sisters.

03:42.189 --> 03:45.192
And I don't think
anybody's verbalizing

03:45.192 --> 03:46.827
how they really feel,

03:46.827 --> 03:48.395
because they all
just took turns

03:48.395 --> 03:49.930
kicking me
in the teeth onstage,

03:49.930 --> 03:53.366
and it would be rude for them to
continue doing so in Untucked.

03:53.366 --> 03:54.534
Yeah, I know, gals.

03:54.534 --> 03:57.771
I know the rules of the game.

03:57.771 --> 04:00.273
As far as runway critiques go,
I do have to say

04:00.273 --> 04:01.641
mine was reflective,

04:01.641 --> 04:04.911
it was mirror, mirror,
so I did tick that box.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.880
-Yes, absolutely.
-That's true.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.148
I will say I'm also--

04:08.148 --> 04:09.516
I feel like
I'm gonna be in the bottom

04:09.516 --> 04:12.352
because my critiques
were really harsher

04:12.352 --> 04:14.354
and they were, like,
we completely lost you.

04:14.354 --> 04:17.691
You had your moment, but
the other moments, we lost you.

04:17.691 --> 04:18.992
You are a superstar.

04:18.992 --> 04:20.293
We've all said it
week after week.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.696
The other girls are probably
like, okay, we get it.

04:22.696 --> 04:25.999
But when it's not just you,
you fade away,

04:25.999 --> 04:28.768
and you can't fade away.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.371
But I'm happy
with what I did, honestly.

04:31.371 --> 04:33.373
I agree. I think that
I will be in the bottom three,

04:33.373 --> 04:34.774
if not the bottom two.

04:34.774 --> 04:38.812
But I personally feel like I was
in it to win it the entire time,

04:38.812 --> 04:40.780
but I do think out of us,

04:40.780 --> 04:42.849
it'll be one of us three
for sure.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.118
Yeah, that's how I feel, too.

04:45.118 --> 04:49.022
I feel like
I can't really say--

04:49.022 --> 04:50.023
I love you, but I'm gonna go
listen to my song.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.325
Okay, baby.
I can't really say

04:52.325 --> 04:55.428
who the bottom two
will be, honestly,

04:55.428 --> 04:58.165
because I don't feel so safe.

04:58.165 --> 05:00.333
What are you talking about?

05:00.333 --> 05:01.801
What are you--what?

05:01.801 --> 05:04.271
No, I said me,
Jorgeous, or Bosco. Not you.

05:04.271 --> 05:05.672
You got great critiques.

05:05.672 --> 05:08.575
I didn't read them as great.

05:08.575 --> 05:13.713
It feels to me
like me, you, and Jorgeous

05:13.713 --> 05:15.615
got the same kind of critiques,

05:15.615 --> 05:21.087
which were, oh, we love this,
but we kind of lost you here.

05:21.087 --> 05:23.223
So honestly,
I'm just telling you

05:23.223 --> 05:26.259
how it feels to me
in that moment.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.662
Right. Camden.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.930
Congratulations, bitch.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.598
Thank you.
I feel pretty good.

05:31.598 --> 05:34.568
I mean, I think I felt
really, you know, conflicted,

05:34.568 --> 05:37.604
because again,
it's such a fine balance

05:37.604 --> 05:40.674
of you wanna stand out,
you wanna have your moments.

05:40.674 --> 05:42.742
I do wanna push,

05:42.742 --> 05:44.477
but I don't--
like, nothing's grosser

05:44.477 --> 05:46.146
than someone just
being like, "Stand back

05:46.146 --> 05:48.582
while I have my moment"
at all times.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.351
And I thought
whenever I've not thought

05:51.351 --> 05:54.588
too much about the specifics
and more about what's fun,

05:54.588 --> 05:55.789
it's always done well.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.190
So I'm glad
that I stuck with that

05:57.190 --> 06:01.161
and didn't get in my head
about every specific moment.

06:01.161 --> 06:06.700
I will say that I think
y'all are the top three.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.802
But in my personal opinion,

06:08.802 --> 06:14.341
I think that Daya
will probably win,

06:14.341 --> 06:19.112
because I think that
the fact that you did

06:19.112 --> 06:22.082
what I feel like is one of
the hardest things to do

06:22.082 --> 06:24.017
in the Rusical, honestly,

06:24.017 --> 06:26.786
is to get
one of the small parts.

06:26.786 --> 06:29.322
You're like the epitome
of what they say:

06:29.322 --> 06:31.591
There's no small part.

06:31.591 --> 06:33.360
-Just big shoes.
-And I honestly feel

06:33.360 --> 06:37.864
like that carried
a lot of weight with them.

06:37.864 --> 06:39.199
Thanks, babe.

06:39.199 --> 06:41.034
I don't wanna be
too dreamy about it,

06:41.034 --> 06:42.269
because I don't
wanna set myself up,

06:42.269 --> 06:45.138
and I genuinely do think
Lady has this in the bag.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.573
I really do.

06:46.573 --> 06:48.241
Performance-wise, you're
fucking incredible, girl.

06:48.241 --> 06:49.309
Thank you, babe.

06:49.309 --> 06:50.944
How do you feel, Willow?

06:50.944 --> 06:53.480
You were amazing
as the Green Fairy.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.714
Thank you.

06:54.714 --> 06:56.149
I feel like I'm in the top,

06:56.149 --> 06:58.184
but I don't think
that I'm gonna win.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.453
I think Lady or Daya's
gonna take it,

07:00.453 --> 07:02.188
which is frustrating sometimes.

07:02.188 --> 07:04.357
This is, like,
my sixth time in the top,

07:04.357 --> 07:07.193
and I'm, like,
so close every time.

07:07.193 --> 07:08.962
It's such, like,
a daft thing to say,

07:08.962 --> 07:12.966
to be like, it's so hard
to be in the top.

07:12.966 --> 07:16.036
No, I'm very happy about it.

07:16.036 --> 07:17.637
-I just wanna win so bad.
-Right.

07:17.637 --> 07:19.739
-I just want it so bad.
-Bitch, don't we all?

07:19.739 --> 07:22.742
But, no, I feel so good
just to be safe,

07:22.742 --> 07:24.711
because this was
such a close week.

07:24.711 --> 07:27.247
-It was, though.
-Oh, my God.

07:27.247 --> 07:28.648
This was hard.

07:28.648 --> 07:30.016
-Oh, my God.
-But it was.

07:30.016 --> 07:32.819
Okay, so I will say, like,
after our little squabble--

07:34.187 --> 07:35.989
Little?

07:35.989 --> 07:37.691
Uh, medium-sized squabble.

07:37.691 --> 07:38.925
-Okay, okay.
-"Squabble."

07:38.925 --> 07:41.027
Our fight.

07:41.027 --> 07:43.363
You know, I did sort of,
like, just take myself away.

07:43.363 --> 07:45.799
I was, like, I just need
to not talk to anyone right now.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.834
I don't wanna look like
a fucking little brat.

07:47.834 --> 07:49.703
Because I felt like
I was being a brat.

07:49.703 --> 07:51.438
You weren't, though.

07:51.438 --> 07:52.639
A little bit.

07:54.274 --> 07:56.309
But it's okay.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.144
I mean, I would have done
the same thing, though.

07:58.144 --> 08:00.180
-I really would.
-I didn't see a brat.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.748
Well, whatever.

08:01.748 --> 08:04.284
You know, I needed a moment
to just take a moment

08:04.284 --> 08:07.220
and go how can I flip this,
you know what I mean?

08:07.220 --> 08:09.723
Like, sometimes
it's hard for us to--

08:09.723 --> 08:12.092
When you are set on something

08:12.092 --> 08:14.260
and you're like, this is for me,
I'm in love with this,

08:14.260 --> 08:15.962
this is my opportunity,

08:15.962 --> 08:18.531
it's really difficult to
sometimes go, maybe I'm wrong.

08:18.531 --> 08:21.901
Or maybe I could have
my own mind changed somehow.

08:21.901 --> 08:24.270
I will say ever since
you got the critique

08:24.270 --> 08:26.940
of you being, like, quiet,
you have opened up so much more.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.441
You've been so much more vocal

08:28.441 --> 08:30.377
and, like, it's honestly
so good to see it.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.178
-Like, you've blossomed, too.
-Thank you.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.247
-Like a peony.
-[laughs] Like a peony.

08:34.247 --> 08:35.915
I mean, it helps
the rest of us too,

08:35.915 --> 08:37.751
and, like, I feel like I'm
getting closer with you guys.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.252
Like, we're all
getting closer, you know.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.320
Greetings from London, honey.

08:40.320 --> 08:41.888
I hope you're well.

08:41.888 --> 08:43.723
Oh, my God.

08:43.723 --> 08:45.191
I miss you so very much.

08:45.191 --> 08:47.060
We usually talk every day,

08:47.060 --> 08:48.795
and who would have thought

08:48.795 --> 08:51.531
the little boy dancing around
in my Mickey Mouse skirt

08:51.531 --> 08:53.933
would have ended up
in Hollywood?

08:53.933 --> 08:55.435
And you were always in love
as a child.

08:55.435 --> 08:56.703
At three, you were in love

08:56.703 --> 08:59.072
with the girl with
the yellow hair from play group.

08:59.072 --> 09:00.840
At five,
you wanted to marry me,

09:00.840 --> 09:03.476
and by 10, I was replaced
by Baby Spice

09:03.476 --> 09:05.545
from the Spice Girls.

09:05.545 --> 09:09.516
And of course at 13, you
fell in love with the ballet,

09:09.516 --> 09:11.551
and you went off
to dance professionally

09:11.551 --> 09:13.153
and became a choreographer,

09:13.153 --> 09:15.889
and now you're starting
your career as a performer.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.224
And your journey's
just beginning,

09:18.224 --> 09:20.727
so trust yourself,
trust your creativity.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.363
You got it from me,
and we're all here.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.865
We love you and miss you,
babycakes.

09:25.865 --> 09:28.268
"Babycakes!"
Come on, Babycakes!

09:28.268 --> 09:29.769
And say hi to RuPaul.

09:29.769 --> 09:31.771
We love him
over here in the UK.

09:31.771 --> 09:32.806
Oh, my God!

09:32.806 --> 09:36.276
[cheering]

09:38.611 --> 09:40.647
Okay, so, you guys, I wish
you could, like, meet my mother.

09:40.647 --> 09:42.582
Like, she's just such
a precious little thing.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.083
She'll just dress up
in cute outfits

09:44.083 --> 09:46.286
and when she goes out,
you know,

09:46.286 --> 09:49.122
it's a dress
with a little petticoat

09:49.122 --> 09:50.323
and, like, a jacket,
a little brooch,

09:50.323 --> 09:51.491
and a hat that matches,

09:51.491 --> 09:54.894
and a bag, specific, you know.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.095
My mum just loves someone

09:56.095 --> 09:57.897
that has, like, a little bit,

09:57.897 --> 09:59.632
a tiny bit of a fuck-you
to everything,

09:59.632 --> 10:01.134
and a little bit of
a "this is the way I am."

10:01.134 --> 10:04.904
And I really do feel like all of
you guys have a piece of that.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.539
So I feel like she would
love all of you so much.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.808
Oh, I wanna meet her!

10:08.808 --> 10:12.011
-Camden.
-Oh, my gosh, my little mummy!

10:12.011 --> 10:13.279
I wanna hug her so bad.

10:13.279 --> 10:15.315
Camden, she's gonna be
so proud of you, Camden.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.349
Thank you, guys.

10:16.349 --> 10:18.017
Before I got
to this competition,

10:18.017 --> 10:19.719
my mum, she just told me

10:19.719 --> 10:22.088
that she thinks
I'm a little superstar.

10:22.088 --> 10:24.791
She just gave me so much
amazing encouragement,

10:24.791 --> 10:27.227
which made me feel like she
really, genuinely does believe

10:27.227 --> 10:28.695
that I could win this.

10:28.695 --> 10:31.998
Well, I'm gonna go listen
to some music.

10:31.998 --> 10:36.135
No shade, bitch, I wanna
kind of listen, too,

10:36.135 --> 10:38.905
because I just don't know
what's gonna happen.

10:38.905 --> 10:40.840
Let's move to the couch.

10:40.840 --> 10:43.476
Girl, I feel like
you're gonna be fine, girl.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.777
-You know I'm a realist, bitch.
-No, yeah.

10:44.777 --> 10:46.145
You gotta look at everything.

10:46.145 --> 10:48.581
You just don't know.

10:48.581 --> 10:51.885
Like, you just don't know
at this point.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.254
There has to be a top three
and a bottom three.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.488
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah.

10:55.488 --> 11:00.593
But we all did so good,
so, like, you never know.

11:00.593 --> 11:05.064
Okay, so after, you know,
our whole casting shenanigans,

11:05.064 --> 11:06.199
what are we gonna do next time

11:06.199 --> 11:08.201
to make that
a little bit less dramatic?

11:08.201 --> 11:09.836
You gotta do
what's best for yourself,

11:09.836 --> 11:11.271
because at the end of the day,

11:11.271 --> 11:14.274
nothing should stand between you
and the prize, you know?

11:14.274 --> 11:16.676
So I admire the both of you
for fighting the hell out of it.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.912
You know, it was awkward
as fuck sometimes.

11:18.912 --> 11:20.113
It was awkward.

11:20.113 --> 11:21.481
The way that it worked out,

11:21.481 --> 11:24.517
like, I don't love
being that person

11:24.517 --> 11:25.985
standing in the way
of somebody else,

11:25.985 --> 11:28.888
and I don't like not giving
my friends what they want.

11:28.888 --> 11:30.790
-You don't?
-"You don't?"

11:30.790 --> 11:36.696
However, like,
I'm, like, not sorry.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.565
I'd do it again.

11:38.565 --> 11:43.636
However, I felt no pleasure
causing discomfort to you.

11:43.636 --> 11:45.772
I felt no pleasure causing
discomfort to the room.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.874
I felt pleasure. [laughs]

11:47.874 --> 11:49.075
I think you were slightly
turned on by the fight,

11:49.075 --> 11:50.076
weren't you, Daya?

11:50.076 --> 11:51.678
Just a little. Yeah.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.079
it did something to me.

11:53.079 --> 11:55.048
[laughs]

11:55.048 --> 11:59.319
You know, I do feel like maybe
I looked weaker or whatever

11:59.319 --> 12:00.853
for saying--for giving it up.

12:00.853 --> 12:01.988
I don't think you look weaker.

12:01.988 --> 12:02.989
I think you look like
the bigger person,

12:02.989 --> 12:04.390
and I'm not afraid
to admit that.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.960
Like, I was a brat,
and I wanted it,

12:06.960 --> 12:08.561
and I did what I needed to do
to get it.

12:08.561 --> 12:11.064
I think you looked
like a better person

12:11.064 --> 12:12.632
for doing what you did.

12:12.632 --> 12:15.034
-And it worked out.
-Well...

12:15.034 --> 12:17.170
And, Lady, I will say this,
because I did vote for Bosco.

12:17.170 --> 12:19.806
I chose you because
I did have faith

12:19.806 --> 12:21.641
that you would be able
to turn whichever role,

12:21.641 --> 12:23.042
and obviously, you delivered.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.110
-Thank you.
-So...

12:24.110 --> 12:25.244
Anyway, I'm just really glad

12:25.244 --> 12:27.780
that that's fucking
behind us, honestly.

12:27.780 --> 12:30.216
I will say, too, Bosco,

12:30.216 --> 12:33.586
our little moment,
our, like, tango moment,

12:33.586 --> 12:36.022
I did feel like
it was a little charged,

12:36.022 --> 12:37.290
-and it was fun.
-Oh, yeah.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.291
Yeah.

12:40.126 --> 12:42.328
So bitches of the world,

12:42.328 --> 12:46.866
there are seven of us here.

12:46.866 --> 12:48.768
So I wanna ask

12:48.768 --> 12:51.537
who's y'all's
biggest competition here?

12:51.537 --> 12:53.640
I would say Angeria,

12:53.640 --> 12:56.275
because I think that
we're similar in some ways.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.144
I feel like we've been
in the top together a lot,

12:58.144 --> 13:00.446
we've kind of had similar
critiques and stuff,

13:00.446 --> 13:03.383
so I think that you would be
my biggest competition.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.318
What about you, Jorgie?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.220
Oh, my God!

13:07.220 --> 13:08.421
Bitch, Willow.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.657
Bitch, Willow,
they absolutely adore you.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.159
And, bitch, every time
when you do something,

13:13.159 --> 13:15.294
they're always like, "Oh,
my God," you know what I mean?

13:15.294 --> 13:16.329
And you're both
body queens, so--

13:16.329 --> 13:18.698
Yes. You're a bad bitch.

13:18.698 --> 13:20.700
-Yeah, you are.
-Thank you, baby.

13:20.700 --> 13:23.770
Angeria?

13:23.770 --> 13:25.138
Willow.

13:25.138 --> 13:29.275
I think that you are
such a unique person.

13:29.275 --> 13:32.645
They see it, they love it,
and I'm so happy to say

13:32.645 --> 13:36.082
that you are someone I view
as my biggest competition

13:36.082 --> 13:40.053
because you are also, like,
one of my closest friends here.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.488
You are a star.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.057
Like, bitch,
when they tell you that,

13:44.057 --> 13:47.193
that's some real shit,
and that's true.

13:47.193 --> 13:49.529
I agree.
So, Camden, what about you?

13:49.529 --> 13:52.298
Um...I kind of have two.

13:52.298 --> 13:53.533
Oh, werk.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.068
Like, honestly, Bosco,

13:55.068 --> 13:57.336
I think that, like, I love you
and your drag so much,

13:57.336 --> 14:00.306
and I think that
we have similar strengths.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.141
I was literally going to say
you for the same reason.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.410
I feel like there's, like,

14:04.410 --> 14:06.612
certain, like, places
that can be filled,

14:06.612 --> 14:08.948
and we both fill
a very similar place.

14:08.948 --> 14:11.684
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Also Jorgeous, too.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.686
It's just, like,
a radiance that you have.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.655
You come on stage, and, like,

14:15.655 --> 14:18.891
I can't help but just enjoy
what you're doing.

14:18.891 --> 14:20.626
That makes me so happy because--
[knock on door]

14:20.626 --> 14:22.495
Oh, shit.

14:22.495 --> 14:26.632
[cheering]

14:26.632 --> 14:30.703
Oh, my gosh,
it is so beautiful in here.

14:30.703 --> 14:34.273
Oh, my goodness,
just everything.

14:34.273 --> 14:36.209
Oh, my God!

14:36.209 --> 14:38.778
Can I please tell you,
I don't know how

14:38.778 --> 14:41.347
I'm supposed to go back to
my regular day job after this.

14:41.347 --> 14:42.348
Like, I'm just not going back.

14:42.348 --> 14:44.684
Oh, my God.

14:44.684 --> 14:47.120
You all look so beautiful.

14:47.120 --> 14:48.955
You brought the energy.

14:48.955 --> 14:51.157
Amazing. How are you guys
feeling about tonight?

14:51.157 --> 14:53.493
How is everybody feeling
about the performance?

14:53.493 --> 14:54.560
How was that?

14:54.560 --> 14:55.561
I think it was really fun.

14:55.561 --> 14:56.829
I knew we were all

14:56.829 --> 14:58.431
really looking forward
to this challenge.

14:58.431 --> 14:59.665
I think as performers,

14:59.665 --> 15:01.667
it incorporates all
of the many parts to drag.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.035
Of course.

15:03.035 --> 15:04.971
And they were telling me,
like, the acting part of it

15:04.971 --> 15:07.306
is kind of new for some of you
guys as well, too.

15:07.306 --> 15:10.476
Is that, like--how was that,
doing kind of the new--

15:10.476 --> 15:13.646
For me, girl, I've been
struggling with the acting.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.149
Like, with choreography,
like, I can pick it up.

15:16.149 --> 15:17.383
But, like, with the acting,

15:17.383 --> 15:19.886
it's really hard for it
to, like, stick, you know.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.053
Yeah. Well, I know for me,

15:21.053 --> 15:24.023
I've been an actress
for 10 whole minutes,

15:24.023 --> 15:26.092
so that was
the same thing for me.

15:26.092 --> 15:29.962
The whole thing was so new,
and I was just oh, my.

15:29.962 --> 15:31.397
When my manager
first brought it up to me,

15:31.397 --> 15:33.166
and everybody was like,
"You'd be perfect for this,"

15:33.166 --> 15:34.500
I was like, "Who?"

15:34.500 --> 15:36.102
I'm like, "I'm not an actress.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.503
Why do you think
I'd be perfect for this?"

15:37.503 --> 15:38.971
But you know what?

15:38.971 --> 15:43.176
Honestly, like, it really was
a lot of hard work, you know.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.545
I just had to trust
I'm here for a reason.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.913
And that's honestly what I felt

15:46.913 --> 15:48.548
when I was looking at every
single one of you tonight.

15:48.548 --> 15:51.184
You inspired me
so, so, so much.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.252
You are here for a reason.

15:53.252 --> 15:55.288
There is nobody that can do
what you do, Bosco.

15:55.288 --> 15:58.991
There is nobody that can do
what any of y'all do.

15:58.991 --> 16:00.493
Just thank you for
everything you gave up there.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.961
-Oh, my goodness.
-Oh, thank you.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.831
It was amazing, y'all,
seriously amazing.

16:04.831 --> 16:06.532
But, yeah, I need this--

16:06.532 --> 16:09.135
Oh, are you coming to--
no, no, no!

16:09.135 --> 16:11.337
No, I'm kidding.
[all laugh]

16:11.337 --> 16:13.606
-I'm sorry, come on out.
-I have to go.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.141
I love you all so much.
Mwah, mwah.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.275
You were incredible.

16:16.275 --> 16:18.077
So inspiring,
and I'll see y'all soon.

16:18.077 --> 16:19.979
All right?

16:19.979 --> 16:21.981
One last hair flip for the road.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.084
[cheers and laughter]

16:25.084 --> 16:27.019
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
at her face.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.287
-She's gorgeous.
-And the fact that she, like,

16:28.287 --> 16:32.024
sees each of us as
an individual, that's special.

16:32.024 --> 16:33.025
There's, like,
a confidence there

16:33.025 --> 16:34.026
-that she has, for sure.
-Absolutely.

16:34.026 --> 16:35.494
Oh, she's amazing.

16:35.494 --> 16:37.029
Ladies, five minutes.

16:37.029 --> 16:39.732
Five minutes to main stage.

16:39.732 --> 16:41.234
-Willow, can I borrow your tape?
-Yes.

16:41.234 --> 16:42.935
Thank you, my angel.

16:44.637 --> 16:46.906
I definitely think it's
probably gonna be me and you.

16:46.906 --> 16:48.341
I can see that.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.176
But, bitch, turn it. Turn it.

16:50.176 --> 16:51.377
You better do it, bitch.

16:51.377 --> 16:52.411
You gotta do it.

16:52.411 --> 16:54.780
Yes, we gotta do
what we gotta do.

16:54.780 --> 16:57.550
I feel confident
about my lip sync skills,

16:57.550 --> 17:00.219
but I feel like
going against Jorgeous

17:00.219 --> 17:01.921
in any sort of dance number

17:01.921 --> 17:05.992
is, like, absolutely not
a smart battle plan.

17:05.992 --> 17:08.995
And I want to be here,

17:08.995 --> 17:12.265
and I want to show them
why I am here,

17:12.265 --> 17:15.334
so I am not going down
without a fight.

17:15.334 --> 17:20.072
This was something up my alley,
and I thought I did really well.

17:20.072 --> 17:23.976
I'm ready to fight
and show the judges

17:23.976 --> 17:28.347
that this is my spot,
and I ain't going anywhere.

17:28.347 --> 17:30.650
Ladies, it's time
for the main stage.

17:30.650 --> 17:32.485
Come on out. Let's go.

17:32.485 --> 17:33.886
Shit.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.324
RuPaul: Welcome back, ladies.

17:38.324 --> 17:41.193
I've made some decisions.

17:41.193 --> 17:44.263
Bosco, Jorgeous,

17:44.263 --> 17:46.198
the time has come

17:46.198 --> 17:50.036
for you to lip sync

17:50.036 --> 17:53.673
for your life!

18:05.384 --> 18:08.688
Jorgeous, shantay you stay.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.157
Thank you so much.

18:11.157 --> 18:13.259
Thank y'all.

18:17.630 --> 18:23.869
Bosco, your fate now rests
in the hands of the drag gods.

18:23.869 --> 18:26.472
If you have the gold bar,

18:26.472 --> 18:28.541
you will be safe.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.743
Now let's see what you've got.

18:33.212 --> 18:34.213
[laughs]

18:34.213 --> 18:35.247
Oh, my goodness!

18:35.247 --> 18:38.484
[cheering]

18:45.524 --> 18:47.660
The drag gods have spoken!

18:47.660 --> 18:49.895
Yes!

18:49.895 --> 18:52.131
Bosco, con-drag-ulations.

18:52.131 --> 18:55.634
You are safe
to slay another day!

18:55.634 --> 18:58.504
[cheers and laughter]

18:58.504 --> 19:02.074
[laughs]

19:03.642 --> 19:05.644
-Congrats, baby.
-Thank you.

19:05.644 --> 19:06.946
Tell her what you said, Willow.

19:06.946 --> 19:09.281
I said, "I'm so happy
and I'm so pissed."

19:09.281 --> 19:11.650
[all laugh]

19:11.650 --> 19:16.589
Oh, my God, I am so happy
I got the gold candy bar.

19:16.589 --> 19:19.158
And I feel very driven.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.359
I want the crown.

19:20.359 --> 19:22.528
I'm making it to the end.

19:23.796 --> 19:26.799
What the fuck? [laughs]
