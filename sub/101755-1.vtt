(low tense music)

00:58.029 --> 01:00.153
- And I brought a switchblade.

01:00.153 --> 01:01.986
A fucking switchblade.

01:03.502 --> 01:07.115
Stay relatively clam, sharp, witty.

01:08.442 --> 01:09.922
I talked him out of murder one

01:09.922 --> 01:11.335
right into grand larceny.

01:13.192 --> 01:14.852
They got me for everything,

01:14.852 --> 01:17.335
okay, they took my jacket, the bastards,

01:18.222 --> 01:20.842
and certainly, they stuck
me for every last dollar.

01:20.842 --> 01:22.462
I mean, come on, Paul,
I couldn't even fucking

01:22.462 --> 01:24.095
make this shit up if I tried to.

01:25.422 --> 01:26.405
I got nothing.

01:29.918 --> 01:32.762
Now let me ask you something, Paul.

01:32.762 --> 01:34.852
How long have I been coming here for?

01:34.852 --> 01:36.805
Coming here to pick up from you?

01:39.102 --> 01:40.085
Four months.

01:41.082 --> 01:43.902
Four times a week, four weeks in a month,

01:43.902 --> 01:47.417
that's 16 times a month,
times four months.

01:47.417 --> 01:51.072
That's 64 days, which
doesn't include today.

01:51.072 --> 01:53.022
Now, every time I get five bags

01:53.022 --> 01:54.835
and you charge $10 a bag.

01:54.835 --> 01:56.852
That's a little bit
steep, that's all right,

01:56.852 --> 01:58.795
because I genuinely like you.

02:00.649 --> 02:03.299
$10 dollars a bag times five is 50.

02:03.299 --> 02:06.025
$50 times 64 days, Paul.

02:07.612 --> 02:09.782
The last four months, I've single handedly

02:09.782 --> 02:13.622
put $3,200 in your pocket.

02:13.622 --> 02:15.942
No hassles, no fuss, no questions asked.

02:15.942 --> 02:19.202
I mean, I'm like the client
that's come down from heaven.

02:19.202 --> 02:21.652
You might as well call me
Jesus, for Christ sake.

02:24.502 --> 02:25.975
I'm rotting away, Paul.

02:27.372 --> 02:29.465
I haven't eaten in three days.

02:30.372 --> 02:32.035
Lost 10 pounds in a week.

02:34.472 --> 02:37.875
See, I'm the kind of friend
that believes in miracles.

02:39.672 --> 02:41.122
Would you be my friend, Paul?

02:44.512 --> 02:46.185
Can you give me my miracle?

03:01.792 --> 03:04.292
(tense music)

03:19.969 --> 03:22.912
- Did you see their faces?

03:22.912 --> 03:24.092
- Why?

03:24.092 --> 03:25.595
They were all wearing hoods.

03:30.188 --> 03:32.338
- Jesus, that's just
fucking terrible, Leo.

03:35.486 --> 03:36.979
I'll gladly do what I can.

03:39.737 --> 03:40.570
I mean.

03:41.681 --> 03:45.905
I got some cereal in the
kitchen, a couple bananas,

03:47.682 --> 03:48.515
you hungry?

03:51.482 --> 03:52.395
Where you staying?

03:53.702 --> 03:55.052
- With a friend, of course.

03:56.112 --> 03:57.670
- They don't feed ya?

03:57.670 --> 03:59.772
What kind of hospitality is that?

03:59.772 --> 04:02.710
- I know.

04:02.710 --> 04:07.352
- Like I said, I'll gladly do what I can.

04:09.985 --> 04:14.475
I think I got some peanut butter puffs,

04:15.692 --> 04:16.842
maybe some corn flakes.

04:19.822 --> 04:21.952
- You know what I'm asking, Paul.

04:21.952 --> 04:23.562
Just give me one today, just fix me up.

04:23.562 --> 04:24.642
I don't need the five.

04:24.642 --> 04:26.342
- [Paul] Can't do it.

04:26.342 --> 04:27.175
- [Leo] Why not?

04:27.175 --> 04:29.305
- Because I played the credit game before.

04:30.552 --> 04:31.542
You start giving it out,

04:31.542 --> 04:34.395
sooner or later people think
they're entitled to something.

04:36.711 --> 04:39.495
Privilege can fuck with
a man's head, you know?

04:41.747 --> 04:43.532
I let bums take caps off me for nothing,

04:43.532 --> 04:45.005
I aint seen shit back.

04:48.242 --> 04:50.092
Everyone's got something to say, man.

04:51.062 --> 04:52.862
You aint the only one selling a sob.

04:55.110 --> 04:56.585
- Well, I understand.

04:57.902 --> 05:00.975
I'll be on my magical little way, then.

05:02.032 --> 05:03.622
In the meantime, if you
could just fix me up

05:03.622 --> 05:04.722
with some of your old shit,

05:04.722 --> 05:07.182
just give me something
that's gonna go bad anyway.

05:07.182 --> 05:08.662
- Leo--
- You're always fucking wrong.

05:08.662 --> 05:10.164
Okay, I'm not lying.

05:10.164 --> 05:13.022
- Goddamn it, that's enough.

05:13.022 --> 05:15.405
You know you fuckers are all the same.

05:16.492 --> 05:18.552
You're panhandling pricks
who start buddying up

05:18.552 --> 05:20.235
just to get a fix on credit.

05:21.722 --> 05:22.895
You want my friendship?

05:24.097 --> 05:26.075
You want my compassion?

05:27.502 --> 05:29.695
How 'bout a bowl of fucking cereal?

05:32.232 --> 05:35.862
- You're literally letting me rot away.

05:35.862 --> 05:37.622
I'm fucking dying here, Paul.

05:37.622 --> 05:40.412
- Oh fuck you, I'm letting you die.

05:40.412 --> 05:41.772
I'm doing what I can.

05:41.772 --> 05:43.217
So don't tell me that.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.717
(eerie music)

05:49.753 --> 05:52.620
You want me to get my shit?

05:52.620 --> 05:55.020
You want your fix?

05:55.020 --> 05:56.561
Show me the goddamn money.

05:56.561 --> 06:00.228
(eerie distorted voiceover)

06:05.273 --> 06:06.606
We aint friends.

06:10.233 --> 06:11.895
You know what?

06:11.895 --> 06:14.479
Get the fuck out of my house.

06:14.479 --> 06:17.572
- I'm not leaving your petulant presence

06:17.572 --> 06:18.982
until I get a fucking fix.

06:18.982 --> 06:21.196
- I said get the fuck out of my house

06:21.196 --> 06:23.398
before I cut you up!

06:23.398 --> 06:24.721
Get off me, Leo.

06:24.721 --> 06:26.321
(glass shattering)

06:26.321 --> 06:27.154
Leo!

06:43.020 --> 06:45.187

06:50.401 --> 06:53.401
(tense eerie music)

07:07.881 --> 07:08.714
Shit.

07:11.637 --> 07:12.470
Fuck.

07:19.882 --> 07:22.512
God fucking damn it!

07:22.512 --> 07:26.225
Where's the fucking dope?

07:26.225 --> 07:28.369
God fucking damn it.

07:28.369 --> 07:29.769

07:30.982 --> 07:31.815

Leo, did you get it?

09:12.832 --> 09:13.692
Did you get the stuff?

09:13.692 --> 09:14.642
- Louis, get your clothes on,

09:14.642 --> 09:16.082
we need to go right now.

09:16.082 --> 09:16.992
- What are you talking about?

09:16.992 --> 09:18.122
Where is it, Leo?

09:18.122 --> 09:19.481
You said you'd get it.

09:19.481 --> 09:20.480
Where is it, Leo?

09:20.480 --> 09:21.430
- He was dry, okay?

09:22.502 --> 09:23.999
- What does that mean?

09:23.999 --> 09:26.385
- It means he didn't
fucking have anything.

09:27.419 --> 09:30.062
(heaving)

09:30.062 --> 09:32.789
Jesus fucking Christ.

09:34.932 --> 09:37.522
- I thought you said this
guy was your friend, Leo.

09:37.522 --> 09:39.504
You said he'd help us out, Leo.

09:39.504 --> 09:40.535
You said he would.
- I apologize.

09:40.535 --> 09:42.722
Okay what I said if I waited a few days

09:42.722 --> 09:43.861
he might help us out.

09:43.861 --> 09:46.475
Fucking guy didn't have a goddamn thing.

09:47.342 --> 09:48.632
- What about the story, Leo?

09:48.632 --> 09:50.032
Did you try the story at least?

09:50.032 --> 09:50.865
- Yes, yes.

09:50.865 --> 09:51.852
I tried the story, okay?

09:51.852 --> 09:53.602
I begged him on my hands and knees

09:53.602 --> 09:55.212
and he didn't have anything, okay?

09:55.212 --> 09:56.672
I mean, what was I supposed to do?

09:56.672 --> 09:58.352
Give him a blowie?

09:58.352 --> 09:59.912
Oh, better yet, Louis,

09:59.912 --> 10:01.382
maybe I should of killed the guy.

10:01.382 --> 10:02.215
- Shit.

10:05.466 --> 10:07.966
(tense music)

10:09.219 --> 10:10.986
- Louis, I never lied to you.

10:10.986 --> 10:13.702
I mean, ever since we were
little fucking grunts,

10:13.702 --> 10:14.852
I have never lied to you,

10:14.852 --> 10:17.162
that's correct, right?

10:17.162 --> 10:18.872
- That's right.

10:18.872 --> 10:21.525
- Okay, then you should have
the utmost understanding

10:21.525 --> 10:23.502
that I would never ask you to do anything

10:23.502 --> 10:25.752
unless we really fucking
had to do something.

10:26.872 --> 10:28.992
We're sick, we're not getting any better

10:28.992 --> 10:30.772
lying around here on our asses

10:30.772 --> 10:32.300
like we've been doing, see?

10:32.300 --> 10:35.520
So we need to gather up
all our fucking strength,

10:35.520 --> 10:38.262
all our fucking spoons and toys and shit,

10:38.262 --> 10:40.562
and get the fuck out
there and be productive.

10:40.562 --> 10:43.572
Louis, will you just
fucking look at me for once?

10:43.572 --> 10:46.832
For once in your fucking
life, will you look at me?

10:46.832 --> 10:48.101
Louis.

10:48.101 --> 10:49.932
Louis, look at me?

10:49.932 --> 10:52.365
Good god, man, just fucking look at me.

10:54.512 --> 10:55.442
Come on, man.

10:55.442 --> 10:57.122
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, look,

10:57.122 --> 10:59.862
if you go out there with me, listen,

10:59.862 --> 11:01.262
if you go out there with me,

11:02.632 --> 11:03.732
I can make you better.

11:07.412 --> 11:08.245
Trust me.

11:15.322 --> 11:16.155
All right, you keep a lookout.

11:16.155 --> 11:17.532
I'm gonna shake down this junkie.

11:17.532 --> 11:18.922
- No, no, no.

11:18.922 --> 11:22.642
Are you, are you sure you want to do it?

11:24.997 --> 11:26.864
- You saying you want to do it?

11:26.864 --> 11:28.048
- Yeah, yeah.

11:28.048 --> 11:31.881
You think, you think he
actually has anything?

11:32.881 --> 11:33.832
- Well, like I said, you never know.

11:33.832 --> 11:34.665
He might.

11:36.106 --> 11:39.402
- All right, tell me where
I should check first.

11:39.402 --> 11:41.032
- I'd check his pockets,

11:41.032 --> 11:42.842
check his pants pockets and the jacket

11:42.842 --> 11:44.544
and you grab that bag behind him, too

11:44.544 --> 11:45.752
but Louis, listen to me,

11:45.752 --> 11:47.226
if he so much as fucking moves,

11:47.226 --> 11:49.835
you run like a bat out of hell, okay?

11:49.835 --> 11:50.763
- All right, all right.

11:50.763 --> 11:52.682
But you gotta, you gotta tell me,

11:52.682 --> 11:54.773
you gotta tell me when his eyes open,

11:54.773 --> 11:56.190
if his eyes open.

11:57.139 --> 11:57.972
- All right.

11:57.972 --> 11:59.523
I'll be right here, okay?

11:59.523 --> 12:00.679
You'll be all right.

12:00.679 --> 12:01.679
- All right.

12:46.972 --> 12:49.029
- Sorry, sorry.
- Fucking rat.

12:49.029 --> 12:50.312
- Leo, no, stop.
- Fucking rat.

12:50.312 --> 12:51.145
- Leo!

12:51.145 --> 12:52.437
(tense music)

12:52.437 --> 12:54.618
- Give me your shit.

12:54.618 --> 12:55.701
Motherfucker.

12:56.559 --> 12:59.152
Don't you ever fucking
touch him, you hear me?

12:59.152 --> 13:00.582
Fuck.

13:00.582 --> 13:03.015
Fuck you, you motherfucking piece of shit.

13:03.015 --> 13:05.477
Don't you ever fucking touch him.

13:05.477 --> 13:06.310
Fuck.

13:08.917 --> 13:11.119
Jesus fucking Christ.

13:11.119 --> 13:12.058
Come here, didn't have shit.

13:12.058 --> 13:12.891
No, no, no.

13:12.891 --> 13:14.218
Damn it, motherfucker.

13:14.218 --> 13:15.051
Louis.

13:16.472 --> 13:19.192
Goddamn it, man, you
took a fucking wallop.

13:19.192 --> 13:20.442
Jesus, you fucking got hit.

13:20.442 --> 13:22.422
I'm sorry, goddamn it, that's my fault.

13:22.422 --> 13:23.872
Okay?
- Am I gonna be okay?

13:23.872 --> 13:24.945
- Yeah, god damn it.

13:24.945 --> 13:25.778
Man, listen.

13:25.778 --> 13:29.222
Calm down, the pain right now
is all in your mind, okay?

13:29.222 --> 13:31.882
Remove the residence of
fear and it all goes away.

13:31.882 --> 13:35.263
Louis, I'm gonna have you sit tight, okay,

13:35.263 --> 13:36.261
I'm gonna be right back.

13:36.261 --> 13:37.094
You sit here.

13:37.094 --> 13:38.582
You're safe, you're fine, all right?

13:38.582 --> 13:39.415
Sit tight.

13:50.032 --> 13:52.005
- How much money we take?

13:52.005 --> 13:55.342
- 75 cents and a blue ink pen.

13:55.342 --> 13:56.505
Plenty of options.

14:00.212 --> 14:01.877
- Shit.

14:01.877 --> 14:03.525
Goddamn it.

14:04.772 --> 14:07.658
I feel like I'm gonna puke again, Leo.

14:07.658 --> 14:11.005
Every fucking second I
feel like I could puke.

14:12.722 --> 14:13.555
Jesus Christ.

14:15.052 --> 14:18.382
Fucking shit myself two
times yesterday, Leo.

14:18.382 --> 14:20.912
Two fucking times, I shit myself.

14:20.912 --> 14:23.582
- Damn it man, will you suck it up?

14:23.582 --> 14:24.415
Literally.

14:29.552 --> 14:31.132
Well.

14:31.132 --> 14:33.722
I'm gonna gather my little brain cells

14:33.722 --> 14:36.935
and I'm gonna strategize
a plan for us, all right?

14:38.372 --> 14:39.680
Before long I'll take...

14:39.680 --> 14:43.263
(ethereal uplifting music)

15:02.546 --> 15:03.379
Louis?

15:03.379 --> 15:05.135
Lou, have we lost you today?

15:10.005 --> 15:12.502
Could you be a doll and
go into my backpack there?

15:12.502 --> 15:15.495
You'll find yourself a little black book.

15:21.692 --> 15:23.642
- What's this?

15:23.642 --> 15:25.142
- It's an address book.

15:25.142 --> 15:27.802
It has names, numbers,

15:27.802 --> 15:28.752
guys I used to know.

15:28.752 --> 15:31.175
Just read me off a few, will ya?

15:34.826 --> 15:38.682
- How 'bout Marcello Scott?

15:38.682 --> 15:39.515
- He's dead.

15:40.639 --> 15:41.877
- OD?

15:41.877 --> 15:43.637
- I don't know, he was a fat bastard.

15:43.637 --> 15:45.475
Probably food poisoning.

15:49.732 --> 15:51.452
- KKK Kyle?

15:51.452 --> 15:52.665
- Oh fuck no.

15:53.832 --> 15:55.795
In fact, scratch his name off entirely.

16:00.292 --> 16:01.125
- Phil?

16:02.162 --> 16:02.995
- Paperboy?

16:04.172 --> 16:05.583
- Give me all the fucking money!

16:05.583 --> 16:08.833
(energetic rock music)

16:10.522 --> 16:11.355
- Get the fuck out of here.

16:11.355 --> 16:12.245
Get the fuck.

16:12.245 --> 16:13.343
Go, go, go, go.

16:13.343 --> 16:14.325
Oh shit.

16:14.325 --> 16:15.392
Paperboy, we gotta fucking go.

16:15.392 --> 16:16.922
Oh shit.

16:16.922 --> 16:18.042
- Let's go, motherfucker.

16:18.042 --> 16:19.503
Let's go, motherfucker.

16:19.503 --> 16:20.336
- We gotta fucking go.

16:20.336 --> 16:21.169
(gunshot)

16:21.169 --> 16:22.002
Oh shit.

16:22.002 --> 16:22.835
My foot, my foot.

16:22.835 --> 16:24.634
Fuck.
(sirens wailing)

16:24.634 --> 16:27.051
(soft muzak)

16:42.047 --> 16:44.202
- You know I stopped
that shit last year, Leo,

16:44.202 --> 16:46.702
you remember when we talked about this?

16:46.702 --> 16:50.105
- Why I was under the
impression you were joking.

16:51.532 --> 16:52.732
- Why would I be joking?

16:53.952 --> 16:55.992
- It had to be a joke.

16:55.992 --> 16:57.932
You used to take hits from cotton balls

16:57.932 --> 17:00.182
out of dumpsters under the bridge.

17:00.182 --> 17:02.122
We used to prowl the beach
every night looking for suckers.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.312
I mean, you were the fucking paper boy.

17:03.312 --> 17:04.975
- No, no, no don't bring that shit up.

17:04.975 --> 17:05.808
- You were the fucking paper boy,

17:05.808 --> 17:06.641
that's who you were.

17:06.641 --> 17:08.472
You were a fucking out
of work fucking addict

17:08.472 --> 17:09.842
just like the rest of us and by god

17:09.842 --> 17:10.712
you were the craziest fucking lunatic--

17:10.712 --> 17:12.712
- I will slap your fucking face so hard.

17:14.512 --> 17:16.122
I said don't bring that fucking shit up

17:16.122 --> 17:18.932
in my house again, you hear me?

17:18.932 --> 17:20.292
- Yes, yes.

17:20.292 --> 17:22.255
Phil, fuck, I'm sorry.

17:22.255 --> 17:24.372
God, Christ I beg your pardon.

17:24.372 --> 17:25.582
Okay, no I was out of line.

17:25.582 --> 17:27.435
- No, no.
- Fuck.

17:27.435 --> 17:28.845
Fuck.
- No, no, no.

17:30.662 --> 17:31.712
I'm sorry, all right?

17:38.294 --> 17:40.982
And what you say your name was, kid?

17:40.982 --> 17:42.519
- Oh this.
- Louis.

17:48.745 --> 17:51.212
- What the fuck happened to your eye, man?

17:51.212 --> 17:53.065
- [Leo] Stairs busted his face.

17:54.932 --> 17:55.765
- Stairs?

17:57.062 --> 17:58.615
- Yeah, I'm clumsy.

18:03.842 --> 18:05.385
- Let me go grab you something.

18:14.637 --> 18:16.152
- I don't think he has anything, Leo.

18:16.152 --> 18:17.952
- Well, maybe we'll get
a chance to find out

18:17.952 --> 18:19.862
if you can exercise a
little bit of patience.

18:19.862 --> 18:20.695
- Why would you?

18:20.695 --> 18:21.528
Look at this place.

18:21.528 --> 18:22.642
- Look, I've known the guy forever, okay?

18:22.642 --> 18:24.065
Just fucking trust me.

18:25.122 --> 18:27.132
- I just don't think it's--

18:27.132 --> 18:28.982
- Louis, just fucking trust me, okay?

18:30.072 --> 18:31.772
Shut the fuck up and play it cool.

18:37.728 --> 18:39.312
- Here.

18:39.312 --> 18:40.962
Go ahead and throw that on there.

18:46.652 --> 18:48.352
You boys want to go
outside and have a smoke

18:48.352 --> 18:49.402
and talk in the back?

18:53.662 --> 18:55.335
I'll be damned, sorry boys.

19:09.174 --> 19:12.172
I remember everything we did, Leo.

19:12.172 --> 19:14.332
Goddamn everything we ever saw,

19:14.332 --> 19:15.515
everybody we ever met.

19:18.572 --> 19:20.302
Those fucking whores
we'd pick up one night,

19:20.302 --> 19:21.682
next day go back and pick 'em up

19:21.682 --> 19:24.355
and take our money back from 'em.

19:24.355 --> 19:26.438
(laughs)

19:27.552 --> 19:29.352
Yeah, there's nothing I forgot, man.

19:33.112 --> 19:34.853
I wish there was but you know,

19:34.853 --> 19:35.875
that's not how it turned out.

19:38.515 --> 19:40.529
I mean, fuck man, I haven't
seen you in 11 months

19:40.529 --> 19:42.579
and you show up at my fucking front door.

19:44.622 --> 19:46.112
Where the fuck have you been?

19:46.112 --> 19:48.112
- Phil, I don't have a phone.

19:48.112 --> 19:49.822
See, my cousin and I, here,

19:49.822 --> 19:51.172
are in a bit of a pickle

19:51.172 --> 19:53.062
and if you could just
help us score something,

19:53.062 --> 19:54.522
maybe just spot us a few bucks

19:54.522 --> 19:55.949
and we'll be back tomorrow--

19:55.949 --> 19:57.172
- What do you guys want me to do?

19:57.172 --> 19:58.402
Give you money to buy the thing

19:58.402 --> 20:00.962
that ruined my entire fucking life?

20:00.962 --> 20:02.102
I'd rather shoot you right now

20:02.102 --> 20:03.835
in my own fucking backyard, man.

20:05.812 --> 20:06.645
You want to die?

20:06.645 --> 20:08.445
Be a man and get it over with.

20:10.062 --> 20:12.492
Look at your fucking self
in the mirror for a second.

20:12.492 --> 20:14.175
When was the last time you did that, huh?

20:15.102 --> 20:16.382
This isn't you.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.922
- Well I'm quite certain it's me.

20:17.922 --> 20:19.362
- No, it's not.
- No, I can assure

20:19.362 --> 20:20.195
you it's me.

20:20.195 --> 20:22.932
The same flatulent
bastard I've always been.

20:22.932 --> 20:23.785
Your friend.

20:24.632 --> 20:25.782
- Then let me help you.

20:26.852 --> 20:27.895
- Give us some money.

20:30.108 --> 20:31.708
- I'll take you to see somebody.

20:32.722 --> 20:34.162
- No, as matter of fact, don't do that.

20:34.162 --> 20:37.912
Don't take us to go see
some fucking Christ pusher,

20:37.912 --> 20:41.062
preaching some false fucking bullshit.

20:41.062 --> 20:42.772
- I got help, man.

20:42.772 --> 20:44.265
People were able to help me.

20:45.592 --> 20:47.132
It can work, Leo.

20:47.132 --> 20:47.965
- No.

20:47.965 --> 20:49.602
You listen to me, you give
me what the fuck I need.

20:49.602 --> 20:50.712
You know what I need today.

20:50.712 --> 20:51.545
- [Phil] Just talk, man.

20:51.545 --> 20:52.729
You just gotta talk to somebody.

20:52.729 --> 20:53.562
- Oh talk talk talk.

20:53.562 --> 20:54.682
Give me the shit I need today,

20:54.682 --> 20:56.131
put it in my fucking veins

20:56.131 --> 20:58.291

21:04.094 --> 21:05.894

You ever want to get
out, you can come back.

21:20.722 --> 21:21.975
Now, if you'll excuse me.

21:23.372 --> 21:25.885

have to bake a fucking ham.

25:53.804 --> 25:56.337
- I'm more like sitting
in his living room.

25:56.337 --> 25:58.587
(laughing)

26:01.492 --> 26:05.182
- I know that face, I do.

26:05.182 --> 26:06.725
I know that face.

26:06.725 --> 26:08.592
I've seen it before.

26:08.592 --> 26:11.082
See, you've come here thinking

26:11.082 --> 26:12.232
that I'm gonna help ya?

26:13.622 --> 26:17.500
Put you out of your fucking misery, huh?

26:17.500 --> 26:18.514
I look at it.

26:18.514 --> 26:20.681
(humming)

26:23.722 --> 26:25.122
Two days.

26:28.672 --> 26:29.505
- Three days.

26:34.928 --> 26:37.272
Don't you fucking try
pulling anything on me.

26:37.272 --> 26:38.615
- No, nor would--

26:38.615 --> 26:39.468
- Save it!

26:39.468 --> 26:40.301
- All right.

26:40.301 --> 26:41.134
- I don't need your fucking excuse

26:41.134 --> 26:42.455
before you're on the fucking ground

26:42.455 --> 26:45.932
and I've got my hands wrapped
around your fucking neck

26:45.932 --> 26:47.655
and I'm squeezing the
fucking life out of ya...

26:47.655 --> 26:52.655
(distorted echoes)
(ethereal trilling)

27:02.682 --> 27:04.231
That's what will happen.

27:04.231 --> 27:06.402
So don't you give me an excuse.

27:06.402 --> 27:08.412
Don't you fucking try pulling anything

27:08.412 --> 27:10.352
because you will fail.

27:10.352 --> 27:12.985
You will fucking fail.

27:14.292 --> 27:15.125
- All right.

27:16.992 --> 27:20.532
- Now, do you have any money?

27:20.532 --> 27:22.509
- [Leo] I've got a car.

27:22.509 --> 27:23.952
- Fuck a car.

27:23.952 --> 27:25.542
Fuck a car!

27:25.542 --> 27:27.137
- [Leo] It's a really nice car.

27:27.137 --> 27:28.587
- Oh, it's a really nice car.

27:30.189 --> 27:31.606
This is your car?

27:33.032 --> 27:34.212
Do you own it?

27:34.212 --> 27:35.352
Did you buy it?

27:35.352 --> 27:37.525
Do you have the pink slip for it?

27:38.962 --> 27:40.982
Let me ask you a question.

27:40.982 --> 27:42.532
What did you would happen here?

27:43.462 --> 27:45.002
Hmm?

27:45.002 --> 27:46.962
When you came here, what
did you think would happen?

27:46.962 --> 27:49.732
When you came here unannounced

27:49.732 --> 27:50.932
to unfamiliar territory,

27:52.462 --> 27:54.532
what was the endgame you had in mind?

27:54.532 --> 27:55.365
- No idea.

27:57.812 --> 28:01.062
- I want you to say it.

28:01.062 --> 28:03.162
- Oh it's funny to you, is it?

28:03.162 --> 28:04.186
It's a game?

28:04.186 --> 28:05.632
(laughing)

28:05.632 --> 28:06.976
We're laughing.

28:06.976 --> 28:09.226
(laughing)

28:17.624 --> 28:19.432
- You're in.

28:19.432 --> 28:20.902
What do you like?

28:20.902 --> 28:22.405
Was it, wait, wait.

28:22.405 --> 28:24.822
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

28:24.822 --> 28:28.992
Is it rock?

28:28.992 --> 28:29.825
No.

28:30.923 --> 28:33.173
(mumbling)

28:35.602 --> 28:36.482
Ice?

28:36.482 --> 28:38.252
You like ice.

28:38.252 --> 28:39.245
You're an ice man.

28:40.962 --> 28:41.882
- H.

28:41.882 --> 28:43.535
- Oh H.

28:47.035 --> 28:50.107
(mock groaning)

28:50.107 --> 28:52.422
(laughing)

28:52.422 --> 28:54.122
- Is it just you?

28:54.122 --> 28:55.882
- Just me, just one hit.

28:56.722 --> 28:57.988
- Just you.

28:57.988 --> 29:00.821
(low tense music)

29:08.144 --> 29:10.269
What about that wee skitter in the car?

29:10.269 --> 29:13.022
- That's my cousin and he's going sober.

29:13.022 --> 29:13.855
- Oh.

29:13.855 --> 29:15.222
(laughing)

29:15.222 --> 29:16.762
So you're just gonna fucking throw him

29:16.762 --> 29:18.623
under the bridge then?

29:18.623 --> 29:19.984
- What the fuck does he matter to you?

29:19.984 --> 29:21.834
- What the fuck does he matter to me!

29:27.683 --> 29:29.824
You're a fucking waste.

29:29.824 --> 29:31.452
A waste of fucking vitality,
that's what you are.

29:31.452 --> 29:33.802
You're a fucking walking waste,

29:33.802 --> 29:35.715
walking waste, walking waste.

29:37.852 --> 29:41.412
Still, I may not like you, I don't,

29:41.412 --> 29:43.302
I may even despise you, I do,

29:43.302 --> 29:45.202
but that doesn't mean I can't use you.

29:46.482 --> 29:48.012
- I'm not sucking your dick.

29:50.362 --> 29:53.525
- Who the fuck said anything about me,

29:54.522 --> 29:57.622
you sucking my dick?

29:58.507 --> 29:59.340
Who?

30:00.362 --> 30:01.355
I didn't say that.

30:03.282 --> 30:05.132
Do I look like a fucking poof to you?

30:06.331 --> 30:07.164
Huh?

30:09.051 --> 30:10.468
Look, look, look.

30:11.987 --> 30:13.322
Look, look look look.

30:13.322 --> 30:16.122
There was this guy, I was
gonna have pull a job for me,

30:16.122 --> 30:18.610
and he dropped out, he
dropped out of the job

30:18.610 --> 30:20.415
last minute.
- So?

30:20.415 --> 30:22.713
- So I'm looking at you wondering

30:22.713 --> 30:25.082
if you're the new fucking guy, right?

30:25.082 --> 30:27.022
Because you have a car, right,

30:27.022 --> 30:29.952
and there's that fucking
guy out there, right,

30:29.952 --> 30:32.532
so there's two, twos better than one.

30:32.532 --> 30:34.092
Twos better than fucking one, right?

30:34.092 --> 30:35.215
- What's the job?

30:39.042 --> 30:39.875
- It's simple.

30:40.885 --> 30:42.175
It's a simple job.

30:47.522 --> 30:49.122
- All right, walk me through it.

30:52.151 --> 30:55.685
- It's just a small liquidation.

31:01.197 --> 31:03.280
Just a small liquidation.

31:05.062 --> 31:06.112
How bad does it hurt?

31:07.596 --> 31:08.429
Huh?

31:10.372 --> 31:11.512
How bad does it hurt?

31:14.672 --> 31:17.377
The desperation of your mind, huh?

31:17.377 --> 31:19.877
(tense music)

31:24.996 --> 31:27.079
Desperation of your body.

31:27.916 --> 31:30.666
(mock heartbeat)

31:35.697 --> 31:39.030
How long do you think you can last, huh?

31:41.422 --> 31:43.335
- I'll fucking do anything.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.585
(laughing)

31:54.337 --> 31:55.670
- You wait here.

31:56.576 --> 31:58.826
(laughing)

32:10.757 --> 32:11.702
- [Louis] Did you get it?

32:11.702 --> 32:12.802
- Nope.

32:12.802 --> 32:14.075
- What do you mean?

32:14.075 --> 32:15.575
You were in there for so long.

32:17.212 --> 32:18.573
What's this?

32:18.573 --> 32:19.856
- [Leo] What we gotta do.

32:19.856 --> 32:22.762
- [Louis] What do you
mean what we gotta do?

32:22.762 --> 32:25.145
- This, Louis, we gotta do this.

32:27.462 --> 32:28.295
- What?

32:30.861 --> 32:32.625
We gotta do this guy?

32:36.322 --> 32:38.692
- Certainly, Louis, you're
not gonna have to do the guy,

32:38.692 --> 32:40.582
okay, but I can assure you

32:40.582 --> 32:42.282
we are gonna have to kill the man.

32:43.837 --> 32:44.670
- No.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.342
What are you talking about?

32:47.342 --> 32:48.175
What are--

32:48.175 --> 32:49.122
- Louis, what do you want from me?

32:49.122 --> 32:51.242
I'm not in the physical
or the mental state

32:51.242 --> 32:54.157
to be driving around all
day looking for Waldo.

32:54.157 --> 32:56.078
But if we have a sure thing,

32:56.078 --> 32:58.022
think it's a little bit easier.

32:58.022 --> 33:00.378
You can hold on just a little bit longer

33:00.378 --> 33:02.422
and the deal is we do this

33:02.422 --> 33:05.005
and we each take home 50 bags tonight.

33:06.033 --> 33:08.102
Just imagine that for a second.

33:08.102 --> 33:09.762
Wrap your brilliant mind around that,

33:09.762 --> 33:10.855
take a lap with it.

33:14.709 --> 33:16.512
- [Louis] That's like three months.

33:16.512 --> 33:18.274
- It's an eternity.

33:18.274 --> 33:20.535
We don't have to hurt anymore.

33:22.062 --> 33:23.322
If it doesn't work out,

33:23.322 --> 33:24.552
we'll take the car out of town

33:24.552 --> 33:25.932
and we'll try and get something for it

33:25.932 --> 33:27.825
and surely we won't get 50 bags.

33:28.902 --> 33:32.002
Luck is being prepared when
the opportunity presents itself

33:32.002 --> 33:34.235
and this, my friend, this opportunity,

33:36.592 --> 33:38.425
this opportunity is pure gold.

33:42.615 --> 33:44.865
(whistles)

33:46.902 --> 33:47.935
You can do this.

33:52.282 --> 33:53.282
How's that eye feel?

33:57.099 --> 33:57.999
- A little better.

33:59.732 --> 34:01.732
Peas smell like shit.

34:01.732 --> 34:04.252
- All right, well keep
the shitty on peas there

34:04.252 --> 34:06.692
for vanity purposes only then.

34:06.692 --> 34:08.702
We got a few stops to make.

34:10.854 --> 34:14.492

34:55.042 --> 34:56.452
- God damn.

34:56.452 --> 34:58.595
Oh shit, that's what I needed.

35:00.184 --> 35:01.401
You know?

35:01.401 --> 35:03.692
Oh fuck, shit, man I'm sorry.

35:03.692 --> 35:05.882
Where the fuck are my
fucking manners, man?

35:05.882 --> 35:09.224
Fucking, you boys want a glass of water?

35:09.224 --> 35:11.672
I got these fucking bendy
straws, man, the other day,

35:11.672 --> 35:12.505
from the dollar store.

35:12.505 --> 35:14.972
I swear to god, it makes
drinking water so much fun.

35:23.952 --> 35:25.252
All right.

35:25.252 --> 35:27.125
Okay, it's all right, it's okay.

35:28.312 --> 35:29.722
Let's talk about your fella.

35:29.722 --> 35:30.555
- Alright.

35:31.622 --> 35:32.455
- Listen, I'm not gonna lie to ya.

35:32.455 --> 35:33.882
I've never even met the guy.

35:33.882 --> 35:35.072
- Why does Neal want him dead?

35:35.072 --> 35:37.985
- Shit, why does anybody want
anyone dead in this business?

35:39.662 --> 35:43.210
Over 70 fucking thousand people
have died in the drug war

35:43.210 --> 35:45.992
since 2006, did you know that?

35:45.992 --> 35:48.552
Now, they're talking about
moms, dads, kids, sons.

35:48.552 --> 35:49.970
You name it.

35:49.970 --> 35:50.888
It's fucking dead.

35:50.888 --> 35:51.721
Over what, over fucking money.

35:51.721 --> 35:52.978
Now it's all once...

35:52.978 --> 35:57.978
(water bubbling)
(distorted echoes)

36:02.877 --> 36:03.710
A conscious decision to kill

36:03.710 --> 36:05.602
all these innocent fucking bystanders.

36:07.512 --> 36:09.212
Now when the wolves come
to your fucking land,

36:09.212 --> 36:10.322
there's not enough meat to go around,

36:10.322 --> 36:11.155
what do you do?

36:13.552 --> 36:14.722
It's not a what when somebody has

36:14.722 --> 36:16.473
to go down in this business.

36:16.473 --> 36:17.523
It's just what we do.

36:18.792 --> 36:21.005
Sometimes a few lambs fall into prey.

36:21.952 --> 36:24.275
I'm sure that's something
you can understand, right?

36:25.982 --> 36:28.025
- What exactly does this fellow sell?

36:30.052 --> 36:31.692
- Motherfucker's bringing in so much dope.

36:31.692 --> 36:33.812
He can get the entire fucking city high

36:33.812 --> 36:35.895
every goddamn night if he wanted to.

36:37.042 --> 36:40.065
That's what the motherfucker's
doing, he's expanding.

36:40.902 --> 36:44.072
- Well isn't that just fucking perfect.

36:44.072 --> 36:45.892
Neal's got us under the impression

36:45.892 --> 36:48.952
we got to fucking whack
some Bob Cratchit bastard.

36:48.952 --> 36:49.785
Shit!

36:51.932 --> 36:52.765
Fuck!

36:54.232 --> 36:55.262
- All right.

36:55.262 --> 36:57.082
The preliminary work.

36:57.082 --> 36:58.762
If I was gonna ask you
what's the easiest way

36:58.762 --> 37:00.705
to kill a man, what would you say?

37:02.352 --> 37:03.185
- A bullet.

37:04.749 --> 37:05.869
- You're probably fucking right,

37:05.869 --> 37:07.702
but you're not gonna get a fucking gun

37:07.702 --> 37:09.162
through that door.

37:09.162 --> 37:10.332
Not even a knife for that matter.

37:10.332 --> 37:11.435
So there it is.

37:12.342 --> 37:14.422
- Oh, isn't that great.

37:14.422 --> 37:16.605
I'm armed with a fucking string.

37:16.605 --> 37:19.192
- You pull that string
around his fucking neck

37:19.192 --> 37:20.772
and the motherfucker's gonna be paralyzed,

37:20.772 --> 37:22.605
he'll be dead within two minutes.

37:22.605 --> 37:25.505
Now, either one of you
motherfucker's got a phone?

37:26.372 --> 37:28.835
- I'm certain that we
don't have a bloody phone.

37:30.868 --> 37:32.645
- Fucking ask you...

37:35.986 --> 37:37.502
Here you go.

37:37.502 --> 37:38.652
That's a burner.

37:38.652 --> 37:40.192
You break that burner after you're done

37:40.192 --> 37:42.035
but you make sure you call Neal first.

37:42.035 --> 37:44.852
All right, you let him
know the shit went well.

37:44.852 --> 37:47.002
Also, you see Pigeon, you tell him I said

37:47.002 --> 37:48.682
go fuck his mother.

37:48.682 --> 37:50.622
Make sure he knows that.

37:50.622 --> 37:53.161
- One to the next, is it?

37:53.161 --> 37:56.661
(soft classic rock music)

37:59.962 --> 38:01.885
(man vocalizing)

38:01.885 --> 38:04.981
♪ Yeah ♪

38:04.981 --> 38:06.823
♪ Oh baby ♪

38:06.823 --> 38:10.573
♪ Every time I see you smile ♪

38:17.342 --> 38:18.425
Irish bastard.

38:19.888 --> 38:22.149
(coughs)

38:22.149 --> 38:24.816
(phone ringing)

38:32.032 --> 38:33.502
- Who is it then?

38:33.502 --> 38:35.702
- Neal, it's Leo.

38:35.702 --> 38:36.704
- Leo.

38:36.704 --> 38:38.349
(laughing)

38:38.349 --> 38:39.862
Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo.

38:39.862 --> 38:41.615
Leo the fucking lamb.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.252
Did Oscar inform you the right person?

38:46.252 --> 38:47.252
- Of course he did.

38:47.252 --> 38:48.842
We're going over there in a minute

38:48.842 --> 38:50.262
but listen here, fellow,

38:50.262 --> 38:51.542
you had us under the impression

38:51.542 --> 38:54.112
we were going to pick off
a fucking regular Joe.

38:54.112 --> 38:55.832
Why, it turns out, we got to take out

38:55.832 --> 38:57.415
the fucking next Frank Lucas.

38:58.765 --> 39:01.582
- I told you that he was a drug user,

39:01.582 --> 39:05.039
a big time fucking user, which he is.

39:05.039 --> 39:07.392
Now all sick people are like you, Leo.

39:07.392 --> 39:08.652
You should remember that.

39:08.652 --> 39:10.475
- Shut your Irish trap
and admit you lied to me.

39:10.475 --> 39:13.022
- What the fuck did you just say to me?

39:13.022 --> 39:15.243
What the fuck did you just say to me?

39:15.243 --> 39:17.163
Fuck you, you skinny cunt.

39:17.163 --> 39:19.719
Doesn't matter if I fucking lied to you.

39:19.719 --> 39:23.046
It doesn't matter if
I fucking lied to you.

39:23.046 --> 39:23.879
Leo.

39:25.004 --> 39:26.928
50 fucking bags each, Leo.

39:26.928 --> 39:29.943
Where the fuck are you gonna get that?

39:29.943 --> 39:33.328
All you have to do is show
back up here at my house

39:33.328 --> 39:34.790
with his phone as proof.

39:34.790 --> 39:35.771
Once you do that...

39:35.771 --> 39:38.688
(ethereal humming)

39:53.947 --> 39:56.412
Don't you fucking call here again.

39:56.412 --> 39:57.787
I will hunt you down

39:57.787 --> 40:00.745
like the Grim fucking Reaper

40:01.627 --> 40:04.710
and I will saw off your fucking knob!

40:10.932 --> 40:12.032
- So we're doing this?

40:16.662 --> 40:17.515
- Look, Louis.

40:19.772 --> 40:20.972
I don't want to see you
get hurt, all right.

40:20.972 --> 40:22.942
So if you want me to
take you back to my place

40:22.942 --> 40:25.652
or even, I can probably
drop you off at Paper Boy's.

40:25.652 --> 40:27.248
- Why?

40:27.248 --> 40:28.642
- Louis, I don't want to see you

40:28.642 --> 40:30.412
get fucking hurt again, okay?

40:30.412 --> 40:32.672
I had no intention that
this little sleigh ride

40:32.672 --> 40:34.232
was gonna take a turn like this.

40:34.232 --> 40:35.082
- I want to stay.

40:37.132 --> 40:38.035
I want to stay.

40:38.923 --> 40:41.335
- Louis, you silly bastard.

40:43.035 --> 40:43.868
No, we're gonna take you back--

40:43.868 --> 40:45.202
- I don't want to leave you, Leo.

40:58.415 --> 41:01.445
How are you not scared right now?

41:05.142 --> 41:06.292
- Why I guess I just...

41:14.496 --> 41:18.002
Listen, I'm gonna let you
in on a little secret,

41:18.002 --> 41:19.205
my little secret.

41:20.982 --> 41:25.282
Every street I walk down,
every person I meet,

41:25.282 --> 41:27.262
I take comfort in knowing

41:27.262 --> 41:30.322
that I'm the most crazy,
unstable person in the room

41:30.322 --> 41:32.222
and that I'm willing to do the things

41:32.222 --> 41:33.922
that nobody else is willing to do.

41:45.287 --> 41:48.620
(soft industrial music)

41:59.391 --> 42:00.493
(knocking)

42:00.493 --> 42:01.462
- Oh for fuck's sake!

42:01.462 --> 42:03.779
Will you let me get high in peace?

42:06.362 --> 42:07.195
I'm sorry.

42:08.392 --> 42:09.432
Who's, who's there?

42:09.432 --> 42:10.732
Who's knocking on my door?

42:14.392 --> 42:15.265
Hello?

42:17.256 --> 42:18.685
Who's fucking there?

42:20.852 --> 42:21.695
Shit, shit.

42:23.116 --> 42:27.699
(grunting)
(groaning)

42:29.036 --> 42:31.619
(upbeat music)

42:33.456 --> 42:35.002
(knocking)

42:35.002 --> 42:35.835
- Pigeon?

42:37.352 --> 42:38.185
- Gary.

42:39.432 --> 42:41.072
- Oh shit.

42:41.072 --> 42:43.172
- Pigeon lives here though.

42:43.172 --> 42:44.872
He knows you're coming.

42:44.872 --> 42:46.122
- All right, that's good.

42:47.893 --> 42:48.726
- Come in.

42:48.726 --> 42:51.309
(soft hip hop)

43:00.532 --> 43:03.142
Anyways, so listen, I
walk over to this guy

43:03.142 --> 43:05.272
and I strike up a
conversation with him, right,

43:05.272 --> 43:06.682
and as we're talking away,

43:06.682 --> 43:08.512
you know, I don't, fucking
something about his job

43:08.512 --> 43:11.322
or whatever, I'm really
feeling like I'm making

43:11.322 --> 43:14.122
a connection with this guy,
right, a real connection,

43:14.122 --> 43:15.722
right, you know we're laughing,

43:15.722 --> 43:18.662
he's hot, it's all going great.

43:18.662 --> 43:20.922
As am I as staring into this guy's eyes,

43:20.922 --> 43:23.672
the lightest, most
beautiful fucking blue eyes

43:23.672 --> 43:26.522
I have ever seen, he's hands creeps up

43:26.522 --> 43:28.682
to his fucking mouth.
- Don't you fucking.

43:28.682 --> 43:31.298
- To flick some pasta off his lip, man.

43:31.298 --> 43:33.835
It wasn't even sexual the way he did it.

43:35.325 --> 43:36.622
I'm not gonna fucking lie, though,

43:36.622 --> 43:37.722
the shit turned me on.

43:39.652 --> 43:41.662
- I don't care what
you do with your dudes,

43:41.662 --> 43:44.552
it doesn't bother me, I just don't want

43:44.552 --> 43:46.265
to hear about it, okay?

43:47.362 --> 43:48.195
- All right.

43:51.360 --> 43:52.639
I'm sorry about that, boys.

43:52.639 --> 43:53.772
- No, no.

43:53.772 --> 43:54.605
Quite all right.

43:55.642 --> 43:57.422
Pigeon, I presume.

43:57.422 --> 43:59.361
- [Gary] I'll let him know you've arrived.

43:59.361 --> 44:02.528
(soft upbeat hip hop)

44:11.662 --> 44:13.722
- Amber, this is Leo.

44:13.722 --> 44:15.075
Leo, Amber.

44:16.252 --> 44:17.822
- Nice to meet you.

44:17.822 --> 44:19.172
- [Leo] Pleasures all mine.

44:21.535 --> 44:23.425
- Some of the best shit right here.

44:25.330 --> 44:26.905
This is tapper's dream.

44:38.012 --> 44:40.212
You got your green card?

44:40.212 --> 44:42.872
Your medical marijuana permission slip?

44:42.872 --> 44:44.887
- Why, certainly not.

44:44.887 --> 44:46.705
- Oh man, that's too bad.

44:48.327 --> 44:49.847
Here you go, baby.

44:49.847 --> 44:51.942
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

44:51.942 --> 44:53.607
I gotta tell you, man.

44:53.607 --> 44:56.962
It's like a kid in a candy
store, you go into these places.

44:56.962 --> 45:00.770
They fucking jars and
jars and jars of nugs.

45:00.770 --> 45:04.704
I mean some of the best (distorted echoes)

45:04.704 --> 45:05.545
and then the edibles.

45:06.862 --> 45:08.352
Of course, I don't know
if you do edibles or not

45:08.352 --> 45:11.482
but I mean, they've
gotten way out of hand.

45:11.482 --> 45:13.382
I didn't know it went
past fucking pot brownies

45:13.382 --> 45:15.012
until like two years ago.

45:15.012 --> 45:18.932
Now they got fucking ganja
coffee and pot butter

45:18.932 --> 45:23.645
ice cream, peanuts,
pretzels, fucking taffy man.

45:24.852 --> 45:26.465
Medicated lip balm.

45:27.362 --> 45:28.762
- Well if you don't use use

45:28.762 --> 45:31.175
then humor me your business with Neal.

45:32.432 --> 45:37.062
- Well, this business can
actually be quite profitable

45:37.062 --> 45:39.032
if you know what you're doing.

45:39.032 --> 45:42.635
I offer service the generally
most people won't do.

45:47.052 --> 45:48.535
- Why do I need you?

45:53.725 --> 45:57.901
- You only get one fucking
shot at flawless execution, man

45:57.901 --> 46:01.282
and as I'm sure you
heard today from Oscar,

46:01.282 --> 46:05.302
this guy, tonight, might
be a little bit tricky.

46:05.302 --> 46:06.842
- On his way to the top.

46:06.842 --> 46:08.952
- [Pigeon] Making his way, yeah.

46:08.952 --> 46:11.725
- Such an ambitious fellow
certainly has a name.

46:12.562 --> 46:13.495
- Sure he does.

46:14.712 --> 46:15.545
Skinner.

46:18.407 --> 46:20.285
- Does he have a first name?

46:22.029 --> 46:23.279
- I don't know.

46:24.182 --> 46:25.015
Could be that.

46:26.765 --> 46:28.585
Did you bring a partner with you?

46:30.022 --> 46:31.872
- My cousin, he's in the living room.

46:32.752 --> 46:34.402
- Good.

46:34.402 --> 46:36.022
Good.

46:36.022 --> 46:38.375
The two of you, this job
should be easy as pie.

46:39.472 --> 46:41.382
Cops could give a fuck
about finding a drug dealer

46:41.382 --> 46:43.332
dead in his own house,

46:43.332 --> 46:45.415
as long as you're not
there when they find him.

46:49.446 --> 46:52.279
(clearing throat)

47:00.168 --> 47:01.525
You uh,

47:06.187 --> 47:09.129
you think you can actually do this?

47:09.129 --> 47:12.296
(eerie ominous tones)

47:32.231 --> 47:35.564
(soft reflective music)

48:22.072 --> 48:24.475
- Lives a little ways
out of town, doesn't he?

48:26.012 --> 48:27.325
- Safer for business.

48:30.432 --> 48:31.885
Maybe he likes the quiet.

48:34.792 --> 48:35.625
Now.

48:37.612 --> 48:40.832
You tell him you'll take whatever

48:40.832 --> 48:42.665
you can for this, all right?

48:47.817 --> 48:50.984
Keep the conversation light and sweet.

48:52.092 --> 48:53.833
- He'll be all right.

48:53.833 --> 48:56.312
- Now, when you get up there,

48:56.312 --> 48:58.362
his security's gonna
ask you for a password.

48:58.362 --> 49:00.745
- What the fuck does
he need a password for?

49:03.415 --> 49:07.135
- Look man I don't question
what the fuck these guys do.

49:10.127 --> 49:12.779
All you have to say is Lemons.

49:15.534 --> 49:16.509
- Lemons?

49:16.509 --> 49:18.914
- Yeah.

49:18.914 --> 49:20.377
- Okay.
- Good.

49:20.377 --> 49:21.210
Good.

49:24.062 --> 49:25.262
Go with God, my brother.

49:33.782 --> 49:34.615
- Louis.

49:36.255 --> 49:37.405
I'll see you in a wink.

49:38.526 --> 49:41.526
(low ominous music)

50:03.949 --> 50:06.126
(knocking)

50:06.126 --> 50:08.962
(shouting)

50:08.962 --> 50:11.242
- What's your business here?

50:11.242 --> 50:12.792
- [Louis] I'm here for Skinner.

50:15.923 --> 50:16.840
- Password!

50:18.005 --> 50:19.422
- [Louis] Lemons.

50:36.944 --> 50:38.269
- Come here.

50:38.269 --> 50:41.269
(low ominous music)

51:25.314 --> 51:28.481
(ominous piano music)

52:09.300 --> 52:11.675
- Sit, please.

52:12.963 --> 52:15.463
(tense music)

52:17.470 --> 52:20.637
(ominous piano music)

52:31.362 --> 52:32.195
Skinner.

52:34.690 --> 52:35.523
- Louis.

52:36.909 --> 52:38.932
- That's a cute name.

52:38.932 --> 52:40.289
First or last?

52:40.289 --> 52:41.675
- First, you?

52:42.993 --> 52:43.826
- Good.

52:46.184 --> 52:47.017
My god.

52:48.275 --> 52:50.575
Mind if I ask what
happened to your eye there?

52:51.486 --> 52:54.475
- I tripped on some
stairs a couple hours ago.

52:55.352 --> 52:58.395
- Gosh, how'd you do that?

52:59.902 --> 53:00.852
- I was in a hurry.

53:01.966 --> 53:03.812
- Well I'm sorry to hear it

53:03.812 --> 53:07.317
but if I am speaking honestly,

53:07.317 --> 53:08.917
I do like a man with some scars.

53:11.875 --> 53:12.708
So.

53:15.372 --> 53:16.822
What could I do for you, Lou?

53:18.475 --> 53:20.975
I mean, you don't mind me
calling you that, right?

53:23.232 --> 53:26.252
- Um, I heard you sold junk here.

53:27.537 --> 53:29.012
- Really?

53:29.012 --> 53:30.112
Now who told you that?

53:32.473 --> 53:36.815
- I um, I actually don't
really remember it.

53:38.135 --> 53:40.275
It was sort of a passing conversation.

53:41.222 --> 53:43.242
I don't even really recall when.

53:43.242 --> 53:45.052
- Oh but you remember the specific address

53:45.052 --> 53:47.025
of my house that somebody told you?

53:49.182 --> 53:53.315
- I uh, I got $50.

53:55.137 --> 53:55.970
- $50?

53:57.262 --> 53:58.285
To buy junk?

53:59.542 --> 54:00.992
- Yeah.

54:00.992 --> 54:02.595
- Which somebody told you I sold here.

54:04.112 --> 54:05.775
- Yeah.

54:05.775 --> 54:07.225
- And you don't remember who.

54:09.412 --> 54:11.042
- I'm sorry, is there a problem?

54:11.042 --> 54:12.359
'Cause I can just leave.

54:12.359 --> 54:13.260
- Oh, no, no.

54:13.260 --> 54:15.042
I'm not asking you to leave, Lou.

54:16.372 --> 54:17.952
I'm just curious.

54:21.332 --> 54:23.282
Naturally, you bring up some questions.

54:24.622 --> 54:25.872
- [Louis] What questions?

54:28.352 --> 54:30.632
- First and foremost, you're
someone I've never met,

54:30.632 --> 54:32.132
I've never seen, you're
sitting in my office

54:32.132 --> 54:33.562
in my home and you can't remember

54:33.562 --> 54:34.785
who told you about me?

54:36.632 --> 54:38.455
Really, very few know who I am.

54:41.713 --> 54:42.546
Now.

54:43.452 --> 54:45.319
Looky, Lou.

54:45.319 --> 54:47.165
I'm going to trust you.

54:48.129 --> 54:50.342
You see, everybody that I sell to

54:50.342 --> 54:51.892
knows my shipment comes into tomorrow.

54:51.892 --> 54:53.622
Now granted, you may have
gotten your information

54:53.622 --> 54:55.142
from someone who wasn't aware of this

54:55.142 --> 54:58.135
but I'm sorry, honey.

54:59.212 --> 55:00.995
I can't sell you my last lemon.

55:02.202 --> 55:03.575
That's for my girls.

55:08.053 --> 55:09.871
- I'm sorry, I didn't know you were dry.

55:09.871 --> 55:10.874
I think I'm gonna--

55:10.874 --> 55:13.182
- What are you gonna do, just cut out,

55:13.182 --> 55:14.015
just like that?

55:19.306 --> 55:20.902
- You don't really have
what I'm looking for.

55:20.902 --> 55:24.225
- Lou, easy baby.

55:25.372 --> 55:27.712
Just breathe, sit down.

55:33.680 --> 55:35.013
On the contrary.

55:38.162 --> 55:41.505
I have what every young man's looking for.

55:41.505 --> 55:44.172
(ominous music)

56:00.112 --> 56:03.119
I have pure velvet purse pussy

56:03.119 --> 56:06.185
and I have it clean, cheap, and young.

56:09.482 --> 56:10.832
You look pretty young, Lou.

56:12.812 --> 56:13.645
How old are you?

56:15.592 --> 56:16.425
- 21.

56:17.470 --> 56:19.407
- I got one of them.

56:19.407 --> 56:21.295
A couple of 23s, 22s, and 19 even.

56:23.652 --> 56:25.185
What are you into, cowboy?

56:27.690 --> 56:29.962
- Look, I'm not here for that.

56:29.962 --> 56:31.413
- Well he walks into my home

56:31.413 --> 56:33.889
looking to create a
partnership with my business

56:33.889 --> 56:36.012
and I offer you extracurricular activity

56:36.012 --> 56:37.675
and you deny me of that service?

56:38.732 --> 56:40.022
- Look, I didn't come here--

56:40.022 --> 56:41.972
- What are you gonna do, disrespect me?

56:45.682 --> 56:46.515
- No.

56:47.362 --> 56:49.385
- I'm into relationships.

56:51.302 --> 56:52.302
That's how I frolic.

56:53.402 --> 56:54.702
So why don't you flip me the 50,

56:54.702 --> 56:56.367
go fuck one of my girls for fun

56:56.367 --> 56:58.145
and come back tomorrow for your fix?

56:59.322 --> 57:00.675
Show me you're real.

57:10.026 --> 57:12.693
(ominous music)

57:23.842 --> 57:25.152
- What the fuck are we supposed to do?

57:25.152 --> 57:26.602
Just fucking sit here?

57:26.602 --> 57:27.452
- [Pigeon] Yeah, man.

57:27.452 --> 57:28.812
We wait.

57:28.812 --> 57:31.120
- I will slit your fucking throat.

57:31.120 --> 57:32.022
Is something--

57:32.022 --> 57:33.522
- We fucking wait!

57:39.286 --> 57:40.119
That's it.

57:49.982 --> 57:51.568
- Ah.

57:51.568 --> 57:53.068
There's my babies.

57:54.848 --> 57:56.608
If that doesn't make you horny,

57:56.608 --> 57:58.108
nothing will, Lou.

57:59.675 --> 58:01.665
God, so beautiful.

58:02.802 --> 58:03.845
Come to Daddy.

58:04.812 --> 58:05.645
Make him better.

58:12.171 --> 58:13.754
That's a good baby.

58:15.222 --> 58:16.815
Let's get you fixed up.

58:19.157 --> 58:22.208
Here we go.

58:22.208 --> 58:24.048
You ready, baby?

58:24.048 --> 58:27.048
(eerie tense music)

58:30.646 --> 58:32.813
(moaning)

58:37.424 --> 58:38.257
So good.

58:46.091 --> 58:47.174
So beautiful.

58:51.412 --> 58:52.245
Oh baby.

59:04.462 --> 59:05.295
Buck.

59:06.832 --> 59:09.945
Take Claire to room three,
make her comfortable.

59:10.971 --> 59:12.165
- Yes, Daddy.

59:22.062 --> 59:23.672
- You like that one, huh?

59:32.294 --> 59:35.627
Why don't you follow Buck for your fuck?

59:41.399 --> 59:42.944
Have fun, honey.

59:42.944 --> 59:45.611
(ominous music)

1:00:12.176 --> 1:00:14.912
- Merry Christmas, Louis.

1:00:14.912 --> 1:00:17.494
(laughing)

1:00:17.494 --> 1:00:20.744
(ethereal tense music)

1:01:28.469 --> 1:01:31.219
(ethereal music)

1:01:55.986 --> 1:01:57.886
(coughs)

1:01:57.886 --> 1:01:59.752
- Why do they call you Pigeon, anyway?

1:02:02.144 --> 1:02:04.530
- [Pigeon] 'Cause I
always find my way home.

1:02:04.530 --> 1:02:07.197
(eerie ringing)

1:02:22.329 --> 1:02:25.012
- [Leo] All right, what
the fuck happened in there?

1:02:25.012 --> 1:02:27.282
- He didn't have any fucking drugs.

1:02:27.282 --> 1:02:28.932
- [Pigeon] What's the house like?

1:02:31.012 --> 1:02:31.845
- He's got a,

1:02:33.002 --> 1:02:36.272
he's got two guys at the front

1:02:36.272 --> 1:02:39.725
and they pat you down and walk you around.

1:02:41.239 --> 1:02:42.692
- [Pigeon] You said he's completely dry?

1:02:42.692 --> 1:02:44.642
- That's what he told me.

1:02:44.642 --> 1:02:49.235
He said, he said he had a
shipment coming in tomorrow.

1:02:53.731 --> 1:02:55.285
- What's the room like?

1:02:59.352 --> 1:03:00.305
- It's wide.

1:03:03.052 --> 1:03:03.935
Real nice.

1:03:06.282 --> 1:03:07.915
- [Pigeon] The rest of the house?

1:03:12.009 --> 1:03:13.409
- He's got some girls there.

1:03:15.435 --> 1:03:17.032
I think they might be whores or something.

1:03:17.032 --> 1:03:19.292
I don't know.

1:03:19.292 --> 1:03:20.392
- What's he look like?

1:03:24.922 --> 1:03:25.755
- Big.

1:03:28.282 --> 1:03:29.115
- Shit.

1:03:30.922 --> 1:03:31.755
Fuck.

1:03:32.702 --> 1:03:34.212
Oh that's fucking just fantastic.

1:03:34.212 --> 1:03:37.078
- [Pigeon] Would you just
fucking relax, please?

1:03:37.078 --> 1:03:38.095
- Oh it's dones.

1:03:38.095 --> 1:03:39.552
I'm gonna fucking kill him with my claws

1:03:39.552 --> 1:03:42.112
and I'm gonna wrap a shoelace
around his fucking neck.

1:03:42.112 --> 1:03:44.362
Are you fucking kidding me?

1:03:46.249 --> 1:03:47.949
- Listen to me.

1:03:47.949 --> 1:03:49.131
Do you hear me?

1:03:49.131 --> 1:03:51.450
Are you fucking listening?

1:03:51.450 --> 1:03:52.571
All right.

1:03:52.571 --> 1:03:57.072
All you got to do is get him
a position just like this.

1:03:57.072 --> 1:03:59.654
Keep your hands nice and tight,

1:03:59.654 --> 1:04:01.975
your grip just like so.

1:04:04.587 --> 1:04:07.962
Then you don't stop squeezing
until he's fucking quiet.

1:04:12.664 --> 1:04:15.705
(coughing)

1:04:15.705 --> 1:04:17.622
- Jesus fucking Christ.

1:04:20.432 --> 1:04:23.175
- Now, since he's out of drugs,

1:04:24.656 --> 1:04:26.715
you tell him you're there for a girl.

1:04:28.082 --> 1:04:28.915
Take this.

1:04:31.155 --> 1:04:33.817
You look like a guy who could use a fuck.

1:04:33.817 --> 1:04:35.132
- Go fuck your mother.

1:04:35.132 --> 1:04:36.149
Louis.

1:04:36.149 --> 1:04:37.315
You fucking sit tight.

1:04:51.721 --> 1:04:54.388
(ominous music)

1:04:56.490 --> 1:04:59.040
- How long you been an addict, Lou?

1:04:59.040 --> 1:05:01.182
- No.

1:05:01.182 --> 1:05:03.123
I'm not.

1:05:03.123 --> 1:05:04.163
I'm not an addict.

1:05:04.163 --> 1:05:05.704
- Oh no?

1:05:05.704 --> 1:05:07.282
You're not?

1:05:07.282 --> 1:05:08.792
- I'm not a fucking addict!

1:05:08.792 --> 1:05:09.625
No!

1:05:11.384 --> 1:05:12.217
All right?

1:05:13.352 --> 1:05:14.912
I just like getting high.

1:05:16.539 --> 1:05:17.539
- All right.

1:05:20.403 --> 1:05:23.570
(somber guitar music)

1:06:16.479 --> 1:06:19.812
(somber ethereal music)

1:06:39.229 --> 1:06:41.752
- Big room to be sitting in solitude, huh?

1:06:44.422 --> 1:06:47.142
You type to prefer that kind of thing?

1:06:47.142 --> 1:06:48.842
- Oh quite certainly

1:06:48.842 --> 1:06:52.502
and I must say this is just
the most marvelous abode

1:06:52.502 --> 1:06:53.495
I've ever seen.

1:06:55.792 --> 1:06:57.412
- Appreciate that.

1:06:57.412 --> 1:07:01.665
Put a lot of work into it,
a lot of time and thought.

1:07:03.702 --> 1:07:04.859
You a working man?

1:07:06.072 --> 1:07:07.605
- Certainly have my days.

1:07:10.334 --> 1:07:11.651
- Of course.

1:07:11.651 --> 1:07:12.932
Where are my manners?

1:07:14.322 --> 1:07:15.182
Skinner.

1:07:15.182 --> 1:07:16.885
- Oh, Leo.

1:07:18.124 --> 1:07:19.932
- Great name.

1:07:19.932 --> 1:07:20.782
- Why, thank you.

1:07:21.769 --> 1:07:22.892
- What's your sign?

1:07:24.282 --> 1:07:25.565
- I'm a Scorpio.

1:07:26.483 --> 1:07:28.505
- Oh, lovely.

1:07:30.832 --> 1:07:32.872
I'm a Taurus myself

1:07:32.872 --> 1:07:37.435
but to be frank, I don't give
much credence to Astrology.

1:07:39.012 --> 1:07:42.615
So, you're here for a girl then?

1:07:43.762 --> 1:07:44.595
- Yes.

1:07:46.066 --> 1:07:46.899
- Wonderful.

1:07:49.027 --> 1:07:50.910
And uh,

1:07:50.910 --> 1:07:54.455
who told you this was the place to come?

1:07:56.186 --> 1:07:57.826
- Oh, Adam.

1:07:57.826 --> 1:07:58.993
You know Adam?

1:08:00.249 --> 1:08:01.082
- Adam?

1:08:02.227 --> 1:08:05.535
I got a Atkins that comes here,

1:08:06.510 --> 1:08:08.093
Alexander but Adam.

1:08:12.692 --> 1:08:14.042
- Just a fellow I knew

1:08:14.042 --> 1:08:15.692
who spoke of this place and I've,

1:08:16.812 --> 1:08:19.182
quite certainly fellow like myself

1:08:19.182 --> 1:08:20.815
could use a little tenderness.

1:08:24.009 --> 1:08:26.259
(laughing)

1:08:28.492 --> 1:08:29.492
- I love it.

1:08:30.832 --> 1:08:33.488
So, what kind of girls are you into, Leo?

1:08:33.488 --> 1:08:36.162
You just tell me what you want.

1:08:36.162 --> 1:08:39.475
- Why, I certainly like all
of the flavors of the palette.

1:08:40.822 --> 1:08:41.655
- Good.

1:08:42.565 --> 1:08:44.602
Not a picky guy, huh?

1:08:44.602 --> 1:08:45.945
- Well, never have been.

1:08:47.602 --> 1:08:48.435
- Me either.

1:08:49.285 --> 1:08:50.472
You know, it's funny,

1:08:50.472 --> 1:08:52.592
I tend to gravitate towards picky people

1:08:52.592 --> 1:08:54.525
but myself.

1:08:57.192 --> 1:09:00.225
So uh, what do you say?

1:09:01.202 --> 1:09:05.135
Shall I bring them in,
show you what I got?

1:09:07.882 --> 1:09:08.995
Bambi.

1:09:10.192 --> 1:09:12.022
He's hard of hearing.

1:09:12.022 --> 1:09:13.455
Bambi, honey.

1:09:15.483 --> 1:09:16.722
(coughing)

1:09:16.722 --> 1:09:17.555
Hey.

1:09:19.904 --> 1:09:21.749
You all right?

1:09:21.749 --> 1:09:24.025
- Oh, just fine, thank you.

1:09:24.025 --> 1:09:25.795
- It's okay to be nervous.

1:09:26.725 --> 1:09:29.372
A lot of guys get scared their first time

1:09:29.372 --> 1:09:30.735
with one of my girls.

1:09:32.038 --> 1:09:35.535
I got married guys coming
in here twice a week.

1:09:37.692 --> 1:09:38.525
Love blossoms.

1:09:39.963 --> 1:09:43.822
Makes them appreciate
their own women even more.

1:09:46.645 --> 1:09:49.335
So, we both think.

1:09:54.576 --> 1:09:55.409
God.

1:09:56.701 --> 1:09:59.276
If you want more than a woman.

1:09:59.276 --> 1:10:01.943
(ominous music)

1:10:12.854 --> 1:10:17.854
Bambi, Jasmine, Ariel, Elsa.

1:10:19.482 --> 1:10:20.585
This is Leo.

1:10:25.478 --> 1:10:29.262
So uh, what do you think?

1:10:29.262 --> 1:10:31.502
I mean, I've got other options

1:10:31.502 --> 1:10:34.812
but these are the house favorites.

1:10:34.812 --> 1:10:36.755
Tend to be more reused.

1:10:39.532 --> 1:10:42.165
Come on, babies, give him a little spin.

1:10:52.940 --> 1:10:54.857
Do I not have the best?

1:10:56.502 --> 1:10:59.169
(ominous music)

1:11:18.652 --> 1:11:20.002
- Do you believe in angels?

1:11:23.652 --> 1:11:24.805
- Can't say that I do.

1:11:28.582 --> 1:11:29.415
Do you?

1:11:34.142 --> 1:11:35.725
- I'm not really sure.

1:11:40.502 --> 1:11:45.502
- Are you familiar with the
Greek God mythology, Leo.

1:11:47.252 --> 1:11:50.845
- Certainly, I've read
in depth of the subject.

1:11:52.412 --> 1:11:54.065
- The chicks have a scholar.

1:11:56.859 --> 1:11:58.859
Let me tell you a story.

1:12:00.812 --> 1:12:05.025
You see, my brother, he's
a ship captain in Florida.

1:12:08.582 --> 1:12:12.945
Ever since he could walk,
he just loved the water.

1:12:13.814 --> 1:12:15.981
Riding on it, being in it.

1:12:16.974 --> 1:12:19.822
Just looking at it, even.

1:12:19.822 --> 1:12:21.242
When I was younger I tried to figure out

1:12:21.242 --> 1:12:23.939
why he had such a fascination for it.

1:12:25.676 --> 1:12:26.509
You know.

1:12:28.054 --> 1:12:29.356
I don't even think he...

1:12:29.356 --> 1:12:32.356
(distorted echoing)

1:12:36.282 --> 1:12:40.752
He was just drawn to it,
something inside him.

1:12:42.982 --> 1:12:47.102
He could not be (distorted echoes)

1:12:54.062 --> 1:12:58.635
The Greek God Poseidon, god of the sea,

1:12:58.635 --> 1:13:00.702
he was within him.

1:13:01.617 --> 1:13:05.367
Not a conscious entity
but a shape of energy.

1:13:07.352 --> 1:13:09.822
But this is true for
many people, I'm certain.

1:13:09.822 --> 1:13:11.812
I mean, just take for example

1:13:12.792 --> 1:13:15.592
someone who has built
an empire for themself,

1:13:15.592 --> 1:13:20.475
a corporate CEO, a
country leader, rock star.

1:13:22.038 --> 1:13:23.669
Now these people (distorted echoes).

1:13:33.375 --> 1:13:36.875
Aphrodite, goddess of beauty and pleasure.

1:13:44.511 --> 1:13:47.928
(eerie distorted echoes)

1:13:51.732 --> 1:13:54.399
This stuff here is so much more.

1:13:57.834 --> 1:14:01.251
(eerie distorted echoes)

1:14:06.495 --> 1:14:09.578
I present to you the utmost treasure.

1:14:10.954 --> 1:14:14.871
The goddess of the self,
before your very eyes.

1:14:17.389 --> 1:14:20.056
All you go to do is pick a body.

1:14:24.115 --> 1:14:25.115
- She'll do.

1:14:26.516 --> 1:14:27.349
- Oh.

1:14:28.482 --> 1:14:29.315
Elsa.

1:14:30.393 --> 1:14:31.726
Come here, baby.

1:14:36.269 --> 1:14:37.102
Sit.

1:14:40.982 --> 1:14:42.352
All right, girls.

1:14:42.352 --> 1:14:43.882
Go upstairs, get ready for sleep.

1:14:43.882 --> 1:14:45.732
Daddy will be up soon to tuck you in.

1:14:47.055 --> 1:14:49.555
(eerie music)

1:14:55.212 --> 1:14:56.422
Bambi, honey.

1:14:56.422 --> 1:14:59.373
You go upstairs, get our bed ready.

1:14:59.373 --> 1:15:03.206
There won't be anymore
business tonight, okay?

1:15:16.085 --> 1:15:18.219
He's a little slow but I love him.

1:15:21.172 --> 1:15:23.672
(eerie music)

1:15:29.172 --> 1:15:31.972
Now that's my last (distorted echoes).

1:15:31.972 --> 1:15:34.272
Guess it's gonna be Oxy
for me and the others.

1:15:39.526 --> 1:15:41.130
All right, hold it.

1:15:41.130 --> 1:15:42.463
That's it, baby.

1:15:45.551 --> 1:15:46.968
How's that, baby?

1:15:48.127 --> 1:15:51.127
(eerie tense music)

1:16:11.527 --> 1:16:13.360
That will be 150 cash.

1:16:14.669 --> 1:16:17.316
Bambi!

1:16:21.127 --> 1:16:23.377
(shouting)

1:16:27.802 --> 1:16:29.147
(gunshot)

1:16:29.147 --> 1:16:29.980
- What the fuck was that?

1:16:29.980 --> 1:16:30.872
- Just fucking relax.

1:16:30.872 --> 1:16:32.392
This shit happens all the time.

1:16:32.392 --> 1:16:33.382
- He didn't even have a gun.

1:16:33.382 --> 1:16:36.148
- Well let's hope to fucking
god he found one, okay?

1:16:36.148 --> 1:16:38.906
(gurgling)

1:16:38.906 --> 1:16:43.906
(eerie tense music)
(metal ringing)

1:16:50.063 --> 1:16:51.807
- Where's your fucking wallet?

1:16:51.807 --> 1:16:52.821
Give me your fucking wallet.

1:16:52.821 --> 1:16:55.154
Where's your fucking wallet?

1:16:56.133 --> 1:16:58.383
(shouting)

1:17:02.102 --> 1:17:06.852
(wet crunch)
(groaning)

1:17:09.572 --> 1:17:14.155
- I used to watch the news
with my dad when I was a kid.

1:17:16.570 --> 1:17:21.570
Something horrible like a murder
or a robbery would come on

1:17:23.428 --> 1:17:26.382
and I'd ask him how people were capable

1:17:26.382 --> 1:17:28.275
of being so terrible to each other.

1:17:30.903 --> 1:17:32.535
You want to know what he would say to me?

1:17:34.789 --> 1:17:37.422
"What's the difference between 10 tigers

1:17:37.422 --> 1:17:39.072
locked in a cage together

1:17:39.072 --> 1:17:41.229
and 10 humans locked in a cage together?"

1:17:43.949 --> 1:17:46.519
And I fucking loved to hear the answer.

1:17:48.592 --> 1:17:50.445
So I'd say, what's the difference?

1:17:53.182 --> 1:17:54.682
This is what he would tell me.

1:17:56.029 --> 1:17:57.762
"The only difference is

1:17:58.831 --> 1:18:03.831
is that humans get to
know each other first

1:18:04.986 --> 1:18:07.653
before tearing each other apart.

1:18:10.772 --> 1:18:11.689
That's it."

1:18:14.132 --> 1:18:17.132
(soft somber music)

1:18:19.207 --> 1:18:21.290
My philosophy in life is,

1:18:23.172 --> 1:18:27.610
if you're able to kill
something (gun cocks)

1:18:27.610 --> 1:18:30.027
you're able to kill anything.

1:18:31.645 --> 1:18:32.948
