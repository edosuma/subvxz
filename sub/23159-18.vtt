00:00.062 --> 00:03.356
I don't believe my grandfather
died of an accident. I think he was killed.

00:03.393 --> 00:06.362
Don't do this terrible thing.
I am on a case.

00:06.396 --> 00:08.693
- If you don't mind...
- But I do mind.

00:08.731 --> 00:13.600
Someone tried to kill Jonathan Higgins
after he talked to you about Sand Island.

00:16.039 --> 00:18.269
- Someone was trying to kill you.
- Me?

00:18.308 --> 00:21.243
- Trouble with a capital T.
- Ice Pick?

00:21.277 --> 00:22.301
You got it.

00:25.682 --> 00:29.846
- I wouldn't like to meet you in a dark alley.
- Don't be too sure.

01:41.391 --> 01:43.825
Come on, come on, move it!

02:07.517 --> 02:11.544
Welcome to Sand Island.
We are your friends.

02:44.754 --> 02:46.915
When is the blackout?

02:46.956 --> 02:49.322
There is none on Sand Island.

02:49.358 --> 02:51.326
If there is another air raid,

02:51.360 --> 02:55.023
I don't think they'd mind
if the camp was bombed.

02:55.064 --> 02:57.157
These guards are so young, Goto.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.192
They're civilians who replaced the army,

03:00.236 --> 03:02.898
so the soldiers could leave for combat.

03:02.939 --> 03:04.372
Knock it off in there!

03:08.578 --> 03:10.409
I have to go to the toilet.

03:10.446 --> 03:14.507
It is allowed, but...
but you must be careful, Enoka.

03:14.550 --> 03:16.814
Come. I'll show you.

03:26.762 --> 03:28.992
All right. Tenhut.

03:29.031 --> 03:31.465
What are you doing?
I said tenhut.

03:31.501 --> 03:33.765
Please, I meant no harm.

03:33.803 --> 03:36.499
No harm, huh? No harm?

03:38.074 --> 03:41.407
I had two brothers.
I lost them both at Pearl.

03:41.444 --> 03:43.969
I'm not responsible for their deaths.

03:44.013 --> 03:47.210
Maybe I'm not responsible
for keeping you alive!

04:38.067 --> 04:40.865
Mr. Nakamura! Mr. Nakamura!

04:54.383 --> 04:57.648
Thank you, Audrey.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Higgins.

04:57.687 --> 05:00.315
- My pleasure, Doctor.
- Please.

05:00.356 --> 05:02.256
You want to do an interview?

05:02.291 --> 05:05.692
Nothing so formal. I was hoping to ask you
about your experience...

05:05.728 --> 05:09.562
The fact that I have
not held public office before

05:09.599 --> 05:14.002
in no way affects my ability
to deal with the issues confronting our state.

05:14.036 --> 05:19.099
Actually, I'd hoped to discuss
your experiences during the war.

05:21.043 --> 05:23.671
I'm afraid I don't understand.

05:23.713 --> 05:26.113
I'm researching a novel for Robin Masters

05:26.148 --> 05:29.515
based upon the Japanese experience
in Hawaii during the war.

05:29.552 --> 05:31.543
An article in this morning's paper

05:31.587 --> 05:34.920
mentioned you had spent
some time on Sand Island.

05:34.957 --> 05:38.256
It was a long time ago, Mr. Higgins.

05:38.294 --> 05:41.024
The war and Sand Island are far behind us.

05:41.063 --> 05:42.826
I realize that, but...

05:42.865 --> 05:46.801
Mr. Higgins, I prefer to look to the future

05:46.836 --> 05:50.033
because that is where our people will live.

05:50.072 --> 05:54.202
If you'll excuse me,
I've got a very hectic schedule.

05:54.243 --> 05:59.180
I understand you're busy, Doctor.
Perhaps you know of other internees...

05:59.215 --> 06:02.912
Mr. Higgins, those of us
unfortunate enough to be interned

06:02.952 --> 06:07.787
knew little of what was happening around us
and wish to remember even less.

06:07.823 --> 06:11.020
I have lost touch
with anyone from Sand Island.

06:11.527 --> 06:14.894
I see. Thank you taking
the time to talk with me.

06:14.930 --> 06:17.057
I'm running for public office.

06:17.099 --> 06:20.899
- I must always have the time.
- Goodbye.

06:40.156 --> 06:43.284
Reliving old campaigns, Higgins?

06:43.326 --> 06:47.990
Actually, no. Mr. Masters asked me to do
some research on his next novel,

06:48.030 --> 06:50.760
some of which is set in Hawaii
during World War II.

06:50.800 --> 06:54.736
It's already been written.
From Here To Eternity covers it.

06:54.770 --> 06:58.934
Not the experiences of the Japanese
who were interned here.

06:58.974 --> 07:02.034
- Do you know where my car keys are?
- Of course.

07:02.078 --> 07:05.479
- Where are they?
- None of your business.

07:05.514 --> 07:07.948
Higgins, why did you take them?

07:07.983 --> 07:11.350
We have a deal.
I get unlimited use of the Ferrari.

07:11.387 --> 07:15.721
- And limited use of the wine cellar.
- The wine cellar?

07:15.758 --> 07:21.697
I found two empty bottles of a very decent
Château de Roi Bordeaux '57 in your rubbish.

07:21.731 --> 07:26.031
- You went through my garbage?
- The discovery was accidental.

07:26.068 --> 07:29.333
But I find it offensive
that you used them to wash down

07:29.372 --> 07:32.341
an order from
something called Macho Taco.

07:32.375 --> 07:36.106
Don't do this terrible thing.
I am on a case. Now, if you don't mind...

07:36.145 --> 07:38.306
But I do mind. Very much.

07:38.347 --> 07:42.408
The very thought of a Château de Roi
anywhere near a Macho Taco...

07:42.451 --> 07:45.477
Civilized people must set some standards.

07:45.521 --> 07:47.921
Ultimately, it's all we've got.

07:47.957 --> 07:51.620
Higgins, what am I supposed to drive?

07:51.660 --> 07:54.891
- Anything but the Ferrari.
- Oh.

07:54.930 --> 07:58.457
Oh, I get it.
You're taking the car for yourself.

07:58.501 --> 08:01.231
Are you sure you can handle it, old stick?

08:01.270 --> 08:03.864
- It takes a strong arm...
- Magnum.

08:03.906 --> 08:08.138
I have driven everything from
rickshaws to Rolls-Royces.

08:08.177 --> 08:09.940
And I had been behind the wheel

08:09.979 --> 08:12.777
of dozens of
high-performance sports cars

08:12.815 --> 08:16.876
long before you were
a mere twinkle, thank you.

08:16.919 --> 08:18.682
Thank you.

08:19.955 --> 08:22.822
Oh, just for the record, Higgins,

08:22.858 --> 08:26.487
I would never drink
a Bordeaux with a Macho Taco.

08:29.532 --> 08:31.898
It was a Burrito Machismo.

08:56.225 --> 08:58.489
<i>Fun's fun, but I was on a case,</i>

08:58.527 --> 09:02.122
<i>checking out the prospective son-in-law
of one J. Rickley Schneider,</i>

09:02.164 --> 09:04.359
<i>one of the wealthiest men on the island</i>.

09:04.400 --> 09:08.427
<i>He wanted to be real sure
as to what was marrying into his family.</i>

09:08.471 --> 09:10.496
<i>Makes sense</i>.

09:18.781 --> 09:22.683
<i>The kid was into growing things,
probably something innocent.</i>

09:22.718 --> 09:26.279
<i>But, on the other hand,
if it was so innocent,</i>

09:26.322 --> 09:30.588
<i>how come his van had more security
than Robin's wine cellar?</i>

09:32.228 --> 09:35.994
<i>The lock on the back was
an Oppenheimer Regal Tri-Bolt,</i>

09:36.031 --> 09:40.400
<i>the kind of thing you'd expect
to find on the gates at Fort Knox.</i>

09:40.436 --> 09:43.872
<i>There's a handful of locksmiths
and B and E guys</i>

09:43.906 --> 09:45.806
<i>who can finesse an Oppie</i>.

09:45.841 --> 09:48.469
<i>And a decent private investigator
here and there.</i>

10:30.920 --> 10:33.445
- Magnum.
- Higgins. I know what you're thinking.

10:33.489 --> 10:36.424
You couldn't possibly know
what I'm thinking

10:36.458 --> 10:40.189
or you wouldn't have the nerve
to come back here.

10:40.229 --> 10:44.188
You know, Magnum,
in various parts of the Middle East

10:44.233 --> 10:47.293
they commonly hack off
the hands of thieves.

10:47.336 --> 10:49.634
Hey, come on, Higgins.

11:21.070 --> 11:22.765
Higgins.

11:25.741 --> 11:27.265
Higgins?

11:28.110 --> 11:30.408
<i>An hour later, I came out of the closet</i>

11:30.446 --> 11:33.279
<i>and Higgins, and his scimitar, were gone</i>.

11:33.315 --> 11:34.612
<i>With the Ferrari</i>.

11:34.650 --> 11:38.984
<i>I hoped the sergeant major
enjoyed his little Sunday drive.</i>

12:38.892 --> 12:40.654
Shh!

12:44.269 --> 12:47.261
Would you mind? I've got to go find a vase.

12:49.674 --> 12:51.767
Colonel Wentworth?

12:52.777 --> 12:55.245
Is that you, Colonel?

12:55.680 --> 12:58.171
Higgins, it's me, Magnum.

12:58.216 --> 13:02.619
The radio's gone, sir.
The last mortar barrage knocked it out.

13:02.654 --> 13:05.646
I've strung the lads out on the perimeter.

13:05.690 --> 13:08.124
I'll be joining them, of course.

13:08.159 --> 13:10.286
No, I insist, sir.

13:10.328 --> 13:14.287
They're my boys.
I want to be with them to the end...

13:17.702 --> 13:18.794
Magnum.

13:20.372 --> 13:22.738
I say, what are you doing here?

13:22.774 --> 13:25.800
Higgins, are you all right?

13:25.844 --> 13:27.903
Of course.

13:29.447 --> 13:33.042
More importantly,
how are things at the estate?

13:34.285 --> 13:37.448
- No problems, I trust.
- No. No.

13:37.489 --> 13:40.652
Just a little hassle
with the insurance company.

13:40.692 --> 13:45.220
- Hassle?
- They canceled the policy after your accident.

13:45.263 --> 13:49.165
- That was no accident.
- I warned you about driving that car.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.328
I could drive that vehicle
through the Khyber Pass blindfolded.

13:52.370 --> 13:54.930
- The bloody brakes went.
- The brakes?

13:54.973 --> 13:56.907
I'm holding you responsible.

13:56.941 --> 14:00.172
- If you'd had it serviced...
- It was serviced last month!

14:00.211 --> 14:04.910
Topping off the tank and wiping
the windscreen isn't what I had in mind.

14:04.949 --> 14:07.611
Higgins, are you all right?

14:08.953 --> 14:11.046
It's my back.

14:11.089 --> 14:13.819
I gave it a bloody good wrenching.

14:13.858 --> 14:17.954
- They can get you something for the pain.
- Never.

14:20.298 --> 14:22.493
Perhaps some water.

14:22.534 --> 14:24.331
Flowers?

14:25.970 --> 14:28.996
Magnum, you didn't?

14:29.040 --> 14:31.133
Well, actually, no. The...

14:31.176 --> 14:36.273
I don't believe I've ever received
flowers before.

14:37.882 --> 14:40.316
It's really very decent.

14:48.493 --> 14:52.224
Magnum, is it possible
that I've misjudged you?

14:52.263 --> 14:55.096
Failed to look beyond
the coarse, primitive facade

14:55.133 --> 14:56.828
to see your truer essence?

14:56.868 --> 14:58.768
Coarse, primitive facade?

14:58.803 --> 15:03.069
After all, you did pick
the Château de Roi. Excellent choice.

15:03.107 --> 15:06.804
Though I'd have recommended
the Lafitte St. Jacques '62.

15:06.845 --> 15:10.474
When I get back to the estate,
you must allow me...

15:10.515 --> 15:13.951
Wrong room.
They're for Miss Wells in 204.

15:26.498 --> 15:29.626
The patient has been tampered with,
Thomas.

15:29.667 --> 15:32.135
- The patient?
- That is my first impression.

15:32.170 --> 15:34.638
- You're sure?
- I could be wrong.

15:34.672 --> 15:39.166
But that happens so rarely
it is only a distant possibility.

15:39.210 --> 15:41.770
I will know more after I've had a chance

15:41.813 --> 15:44.646
to give her a thorough physical examination.

15:44.682 --> 15:48.015
- Physical examination?
- You leave her with me.

15:48.052 --> 15:51.044
I will know for certain in a couple of days.

15:51.890 --> 15:55.155
Go on, go on. She'll be fine.

15:55.193 --> 15:56.387
Trust me.

16:08.806 --> 16:11.775
<i>If Victor was right about never being wrong,</i>

16:11.809 --> 16:15.438
<i>someone was trying to kill
whoever was driving the car.</i>

16:15.480 --> 16:18.347
<i>Normally, I'd say they were after me</i>.

16:26.691 --> 16:29.558
<i>Then I noticed the article on Enoka</i>.

16:29.594 --> 16:34.497
<i>Higgins had circled the bit about his stint
at Sand Island and that rang a bell.</i>

16:34.532 --> 16:36.500
<i>I couldn't figure out why</i>.

16:37.635 --> 16:40.399
<i>Then I remembered the jelly</i>.

16:55.853 --> 16:59.084
- <i>Canyon Hospital</i>.
- Room 416, please.

17:02.160 --> 17:05.253
- <i>Hello</i>.
- Higgins, it's me.

17:05.296 --> 17:09.561
Something's gone terribly wrong
at the estate, I can sense it.

17:09.901 --> 17:13.301
- Everything's fine at the estate.
- <i>It is?</i>

17:13.337 --> 17:16.101
Yeah. I've been sitting at your desk...

17:16.140 --> 17:19.507
What? If you so much as touch one item...

17:19.542 --> 17:23.205
I wouldn't think of it. Listen,
what do you know about Kirin Nakamura?

17:23.247 --> 17:26.272
Nakamura? I don't know
anyone with that name.

17:27.151 --> 17:29.346
- <i>What are you doing?</i>
- Nothing.

17:29.387 --> 17:31.753
Nakamura died at Sand Island.

17:31.789 --> 17:35.486
You've been rummaging
through my research material.

17:35.526 --> 17:39.087
You're drinking my French Cognac,
aren't you?

17:39.130 --> 17:43.567
I wouldn't even dream of drinking it.
What about Richard Enoka?

17:43.601 --> 17:45.762
I spoke to Dr. Enoka this morning.

17:45.803 --> 17:49.500
- Did you ask about Sand Island?
- As a matter of fact, I did.

17:49.540 --> 17:52.270
You're eating at my desk. I can hear you.

17:52.310 --> 17:56.144
No, I am not eating.
What did he tell you about Sand Island?

17:56.180 --> 17:59.411
Nothing at all. Wouldn't discuss it.

17:59.450 --> 18:03.682
Are you smoking one of my handmade
Canary Island cigars?

18:03.721 --> 18:05.882
- Thanks, Higgins.
- <i>Magnum</i>...

18:10.561 --> 18:14.759
<i>In the islands, everything and everyone
has some kind of history.</i>

18:14.799 --> 18:17.927
<i>40 years had passed
since Kirin Nakamura died,</i>

18:17.969 --> 18:20.028
<i>but I wondered if that accident</i>

18:20.071 --> 18:23.939
<i>had something to do with the one
which almost killed Higgins.</i>

18:23.975 --> 18:28.878
<i>However, Higgins wasn't paying me,
while J. Rickley Schneider was.</i>

18:28.913 --> 18:31.746
<i>It's tough,
choosing between friends and money,</i>

18:31.782 --> 18:34.808
<i>and with luck, I figured I wouldn't have to</i>.

18:36.921 --> 18:40.823
- You've got to be kidding.
- It's just a couple of days, T.C.

18:40.858 --> 18:43.156
You won't have to use the chopper,
I promise.

18:43.194 --> 18:45.856
Oh, good, that makes me feel a lot better.

18:45.896 --> 18:49.093
- We'll work out something fair.
- Fair?

18:53.337 --> 18:57.433
Hello. Island Hoppers.
Could you hold, please?

18:57.475 --> 19:00.933
It ain't gonna sound no better
talking it to death.

19:00.978 --> 19:03.708
If you don't mind, I have a business to run.

19:03.748 --> 19:06.546
OK, we'll split the commission, 50-50.

19:09.620 --> 19:11.918
80-20.

19:11.956 --> 19:13.719
What?

19:13.758 --> 19:15.749
That is low, T.C. Really low.

19:16.927 --> 19:19.020
Take it or leave it, Thomas.

19:19.063 --> 19:21.395
70-30.

19:21.432 --> 19:23.696
After expenses?

19:31.675 --> 19:34.143
Uh, hello.

19:34.178 --> 19:36.009
No, we're still shut down.

19:36.047 --> 19:40.074
The parts will be in next week.
Would you call back then?

19:40.117 --> 19:42.108
Thank you very much.

20:21.392 --> 20:22.984
- Mr. Magnum?
- Yes.

20:23.027 --> 20:25.655
Nancy Nakamura. I'm glad you could come.

20:25.696 --> 20:27.288
Thanks.

20:27.331 --> 20:30.323
You don't look
much like a research assistant.

20:30.367 --> 20:33.825
In fact, you don't look anything like one.

20:33.871 --> 20:37.307
- Sorry.
- Don't be. My dad's in the backyard.

20:40.144 --> 20:43.739
He spends all his free time
working on his bonsai.

20:43.781 --> 20:45.976
He says it helps quiet his mind.

20:46.016 --> 20:50.009
The other school of thought is
it helps turn it off.

21:03.801 --> 21:06.031
Dad, Mr. Magnum is here.

21:06.070 --> 21:11.064
The man who phoned about Sand Island.
About Grandfather.

21:13.844 --> 21:16.642
You know anything about bonsai?

21:16.680 --> 21:18.705
No, not really.

21:20.184 --> 21:25.144
In nature, the trees or plants
that work hardest for survival

21:25.189 --> 21:29.353
reflect that struggle
in its diminutive size and twisted shape.

21:29.393 --> 21:33.557
To the Western eye,
that appearance may be unpleasant.

21:35.099 --> 21:38.728
But to us, the signs of that will to live

21:38.769 --> 21:41.101
is considered the most beautiful.

21:41.138 --> 21:44.869
Dad, I don't think Mr. Magnum
came to discuss some ancient art

21:44.909 --> 21:49.744
that doesn't have anything to do with
what happened 40 years ago to your father.

21:49.780 --> 21:51.407
That's quite enough.

21:52.650 --> 21:56.552
I've read all the accounts
of your father's death at Sand Island,

21:56.587 --> 21:59.556
including the army inquiry and newspapers.

21:59.590 --> 22:03.583
- They reported it as an accident.
- It wasn't an accident.

22:03.627 --> 22:07.688
You know as well as I do,
newspapers don't tell the truth. Not all of it.

22:07.731 --> 22:09.824
- Just like some people...
- Nancy.

22:09.867 --> 22:13.325
It's true.
You listen to people like Richard Enoka,

22:13.370 --> 22:16.828
you wouldn't know Sand Island existed,
and he was there.

22:16.874 --> 22:18.466
- Did he know your grandfather?
- Yes.

22:18.509 --> 22:20.033
No.

22:22.179 --> 22:26.479
Mr. Magnum, many people
suffered during their internment.

22:26.517 --> 22:28.508
Some died.

22:28.552 --> 22:31.919
Those of us who survived
are not unlike the bonsai.

22:31.956 --> 22:34.481
We wear our suffering as a reminder.

22:34.525 --> 22:37.824
To talk about it
is unnecessary and painful.

22:37.861 --> 22:41.797
Someone has to. Or what's
to prevent it from happening again?

22:41.832 --> 22:45.529
Nancy, this does not involve you.

22:46.637 --> 22:50.971
My daughter should not have
encouraged you to come. I am sorry.

23:01.785 --> 23:06.950
Oh, he is so wrong!
I mean, he's my father and I love him, but...

23:06.991 --> 23:09.186
He's like so many people his age.

23:09.226 --> 23:10.921
They wanna forget.

23:10.961 --> 23:13.828
- And you don't?
- Not for a second.

23:13.864 --> 23:16.458
I don't believe my grandfather
died of an accident.

23:16.500 --> 23:19.901
I think he was killed.
I'm not willing to forget it.

23:19.937 --> 23:23.031
Why are you so concerned
about my grandfather?

23:23.874 --> 23:25.739
My friend was almost killed,

23:25.776 --> 23:28.540
and it had to do with
what happened on Sand Island.

23:28.579 --> 23:31.776
- I was hoping your father could help me.
- I don't think so.

23:31.815 --> 23:35.842
But there is a man, Saichi Goto,
he was there.

23:35.886 --> 23:38.719
- He remembers.
- I'd like to talk to him.

24:06.367 --> 24:08.358
Domo arigato.

24:10.137 --> 24:12.605
I can't eat the stuff.

24:12.640 --> 24:13.766
Let me.

24:25.986 --> 24:29.285
I don't think I'd like to meet you
in a dark alley.

24:30.558 --> 24:35.689
Goto thinks I should act more like
a traditional Japanese woman. Don't you?

24:37.798 --> 24:41.825
Goto... the night Kirin Nakamura died,

24:41.869 --> 24:45.100
did you see anything out of the ordinary?

24:45.139 --> 24:49.439
Everything at Sand Island was
out of the ordinary, Mr. Magnum.

24:49.476 --> 24:51.467
Did you see the accident?

24:51.512 --> 24:54.345
It was dark. We could not see too well.

24:54.381 --> 24:56.076
We?

24:56.116 --> 24:58.414
There were others with you?

25:00.254 --> 25:02.415
What about the guards?

25:11.765 --> 25:15.166
Thank you, Goto.
Perhaps we can talk again sometime.

25:15.202 --> 25:17.193
But, Thomas...

25:22.776 --> 25:26.268
Why did you stop?
He was covering something.

25:26.313 --> 25:28.679
He won't say anything with you there.

25:28.716 --> 25:30.377
That's ridiculous!

25:30.417 --> 25:34.547
- I've known him all my life.
- Exactly. You just stay here.

25:34.588 --> 25:37.113
You're treating me just like Goto.

25:38.559 --> 25:40.652
Not exactly.

25:59.013 --> 26:02.005
There's a little more, isn't there?

26:02.049 --> 26:05.075
- It is difficult.
- I know.

26:05.789 --> 26:07.723
There were two guards.

26:07.755 --> 26:11.691
They beat Kirin Nakamura
and left him to die.

26:11.725 --> 26:14.558
What do you remember about them?

26:14.595 --> 26:17.029
The sergeant I remember best.

26:17.064 --> 26:21.433
He was bigger than the others,
with light blue eyes.

26:21.468 --> 26:24.301
And he held his club in this hand.

26:24.338 --> 26:27.364
- Do you remember a name?
- Sorenson.

26:27.408 --> 26:30.605
- No first name?
- I heard only Sorenson.

26:30.644 --> 26:32.942
His eyes were cruel and cold.

26:33.981 --> 26:39.146
I have never forgotten him
and the others, or Kirin Nakamura.

26:55.585 --> 26:57.416
I've given it a good deal of thought.

26:57.453 --> 27:02.823
I think it only fair that you be held
accountable for the cost of restoring the car.

27:02.859 --> 27:06.522
- The accident wasn't your fault.
- You're bloody right.

27:06.562 --> 27:08.393
Or mine.

27:08.431 --> 27:11.798
Victor said
somebody tampered with the brakes.

27:11.834 --> 27:13.768
What?

27:13.803 --> 27:15.828
Well, it's obvious, I suppose.

27:15.872 --> 27:19.137
One of the criminal elements on this island
has taken exception

27:19.175 --> 27:22.804
to you sticking your nose
into their nefarious affairs.

27:22.845 --> 27:27.248
Actually, Higgins, I think
somebody was trying to kill you.

27:27.283 --> 27:28.944
Me?

27:28.985 --> 27:30.885
- Me?
- Yes, you.

27:30.920 --> 27:35.050
The morning you met with Enoka,
did you go anywhere else?

27:35.091 --> 27:38.219
My God, Magnum,
you sound like Perry Mason.

27:38.261 --> 27:39.694
Come on, Higgins!

27:41.531 --> 27:44.932
If you must know, the lads and I took a turn
by the ASCC show.

27:44.967 --> 27:46.559
ASCC show?

27:46.602 --> 27:51.539
The Anglo-Saxon Canine Corps
had their semi-annual competition.

27:51.574 --> 27:53.303
I thought the lads might enjoy it.

27:53.342 --> 27:56.470
Then I dropped them at the estate
and went to see Enoka.

27:56.512 --> 27:58.810
- Just him?
- Yes.

28:02.785 --> 28:04.218
What are you up to?

28:05.888 --> 28:07.480
I say, Magnum!

28:07.523 --> 28:09.457
Does the name Sorenson mean...

28:10.726 --> 28:12.523
Higgins!

28:12.962 --> 28:17.763
Oh... my... God!

28:18.801 --> 28:19.961
Higgins!

28:20.870 --> 28:25.569
<i>They're off and runningl
The field away to a beautiful start.</i>

28:25.608 --> 28:27.940
Attaboy! Let him go! Give him his head!

28:28.744 --> 28:33.238
This is heavy. This kid has grown
enough stuff to supply half of Beverly Hills!

28:33.282 --> 28:36.547
What's his name?
My horse is going to the front! Go!

28:36.586 --> 28:39.646
Denny Jensen.
I've been on his tail for 24 hours.

28:39.689 --> 28:43.386
This boy is buying gardening supplies
like they're going out of style.

28:43.426 --> 28:48.022
Sprinklers, fertilizers, soil additives.
You name it, this kid is buying it.

28:48.064 --> 28:52.194
- Maybe he's into organic gardening.
- Gardening, sure. I dunno how organic.

28:52.235 --> 28:53.964
Watch the seven horse!

28:54.003 --> 28:55.766
The seven... You... Dummy.

28:56.639 --> 28:59.608
Piece of cake. Hah!

29:00.276 --> 29:02.710
- 80%/%.
- 80%/%!

29:03.913 --> 29:06.939
If this guy's growing, he's probably selling.

29:06.983 --> 29:09.508
- I say we call the cops.
- Uh-uh. Not yet.

29:09.552 --> 29:12.680
I don't want to set him up if he's innocent.

29:12.722 --> 29:15.452
75%/%?

29:15.491 --> 29:17.857
OK. But you are keeping a log?

29:17.894 --> 29:19.759
You can do it. Come on!

29:19.795 --> 29:23.595
He's either driving all over the island
at 90 miles an hour

29:23.633 --> 29:26.193
or hanging out at the Harbor Inn.

29:26.235 --> 29:29.136
I won 20 bucks off him shooting eight-ball.

29:29.972 --> 29:33.999
- Shooting eight-ball?
- It's part of my cover.

29:34.043 --> 29:38.207
Some cover. Playing pool and drinking beer.
I knew this P. I. Stuff was a scam.

29:38.247 --> 29:41.512
He's gonna make it, he's going all the way!
Go, go, go!

29:41.551 --> 29:45.317
- Oops, I gotta split.
- The Harbor Inn isn't open yet.

29:45.354 --> 29:48.551
The kid has lunch
at the Polynesian Paradise.

29:48.591 --> 29:50.081
Polynesian Paradise?

29:50.126 --> 29:55.462
Oh, don't worry, T. M.
I have receipts for everything.

29:55.498 --> 29:57.398
<i>Dominic's Dream breaks downl.</i>

29:57.433 --> 30:00.766
<i>The jockey's pulling him up. He is out of it</i>.

30:00.803 --> 30:02.794
Hey, T.C...

30:05.174 --> 30:08.837
This place is expensive!

30:12.949 --> 30:14.644
What happened?

30:14.899 --> 30:16.389
The bum broke his leg.

30:17.423 --> 30:20.722
If Ice Pick calls,
tell him I moved to New Jersey.

30:21.591 --> 30:24.424
Rick, I could use some help.

30:24.460 --> 30:28.123
Sure. You and T.C. can do that P. I. Stuff,
anybody can do it.

30:28.164 --> 30:31.998
Great. I need you to help me
find this guy, Sorenson.

30:32.034 --> 30:34.594
I think he's between 55 and 60.

30:34.637 --> 30:38.266
Probably six feet tall.
Maybe even has gray hair.

30:38.307 --> 30:41.765
He was in the Navy
in Honolulu during World War II.

30:41.811 --> 30:45.178
Good. There aren't
too many of those guys around.

30:45.214 --> 30:47.079
- You got a picture?
- No.

30:47.116 --> 30:48.981
- You know what he does?
- No.

30:49.018 --> 30:51.486
When was the last time
anybody saw him?

30:51.520 --> 30:53.044
About 40 years ago.

30:53.089 --> 30:59.255
- Do you know anything about this guy?
- Um, he's left-handed.

30:59.295 --> 31:01.160
Plays golf out in Hanaloa.

31:01.197 --> 31:03.927
Hell of a duffer. First name is Fred.

31:14.710 --> 31:17.304
<i>Mr. Sorenson to the first tee, please</i>.

31:17.346 --> 31:20.338
<i>Mr. Sorenson, tee-off in five minutes</i>.

31:22.251 --> 31:25.414
- You're a guest of Robin Masters?
- Yep.

31:25.454 --> 31:30.448
Gave him a lesson. Had a hook that
could have knocked out Jack Dempsey.

31:31.594 --> 31:34.028
Sorenson. Would that be Fred Sorenson?

31:34.063 --> 31:37.260
Sure is. Plays here nearly every day.

31:37.299 --> 31:40.564
I'll be darned.
I played at Spyglass with him last year.

31:40.603 --> 31:41.797
The Pro-Am, huh?

31:41.837 --> 31:47.070
Yeah. I'd love to give him a chance
to win back that grand that I took from him.

31:47.109 --> 31:49.441
Could you pair me off with him?

31:49.478 --> 31:54.745
Uh, as a matter of fact, he's looking
for a partner. It's kind of slow today.

31:54.784 --> 31:58.948
That's great. I'm gonna tell Robin
how helpful you've been.

31:58.988 --> 32:01.548
Mr. Magnum. Your green fees.

32:02.358 --> 32:04.383
My green fees?

32:05.561 --> 32:08.428
Right. My green fees.

32:08.464 --> 32:10.489
That's $45.

32:16.505 --> 32:19.065
- There you go.
- Mr. Magnum.

32:19.108 --> 32:21.406
It's $22.50 for the cart.

32:23.212 --> 32:25.908
I love to walk.

32:28.317 --> 32:32.083
Fred. Thomas Magnum.
Looks like we're playing together.

32:32.121 --> 32:33.213
Are we?

32:33.255 --> 32:35.689
The pro said you needed a partner.
You mind?

32:35.725 --> 32:37.818
No. You play much?

32:38.728 --> 32:42.164
No. Well, I used to,
but then business picked up.

32:42.198 --> 32:44.462
I conduct all my business out here.

32:44.500 --> 32:47.230
That's some life. What line of business?

32:47.269 --> 32:51.603
Import-export mostly.
Some real estate investment.

32:51.640 --> 32:54.006
Somehow I figured you for a Navy.

32:54.043 --> 32:56.409
Navy? No way.

32:56.445 --> 33:00.848
Closest I came to the military
was the civilian guard during the war.

33:00.883 --> 33:02.942
- Go ahead.
- Oh, thank you.

33:07.056 --> 33:11.516
Southpaw, huh? Must be difficult
finding decent clubs.

33:11.560 --> 33:13.619
No. Not at all.

33:26.575 --> 33:28.805
Been a while. Mulligans?

33:28.844 --> 33:33.144
Yeah, baby. Dinner at your place
at eight. Hey, that...

33:33.182 --> 33:35.377
Oh. I can't make it.

33:36.385 --> 33:39.377
I'm working this really big, important case.

33:39.421 --> 33:42.254
I'll have to take a rain check.

33:42.291 --> 33:46.193
No rain check? Oh, baby, come on. Look...

33:46.228 --> 33:48.253
T.C., T.C.

33:48.297 --> 33:51.061
Would you hold the phone
for just a minute?

33:51.100 --> 33:53.762
- I need your help.
- What are you doing bothering me?

33:53.803 --> 33:56.363
I'm running a business here.

33:56.405 --> 33:57.929
I'm in trouble. Please?

33:57.973 --> 34:00.498
Keep it away from me.
I got enough of it for myself.

34:00.543 --> 34:05.173
- I'm talkin' trouble with a capital T.
- And that rhymes with P and... Ice Pick?

34:05.214 --> 34:07.808
You got it. You know the horse race?

34:07.850 --> 34:11.616
I need cash quick or I'm gonna be
pushing coconuts up in Maui.

34:11.654 --> 34:13.815
Oh, wow. OK, how much?

34:13.856 --> 34:16.380
- Two big ones.
- Two big ones.

34:17.159 --> 34:19.922
No, no, no. Big ones.

34:25.100 --> 34:28.092
Uh, maybe we can work out something.

34:28.137 --> 34:32.039
- Baby, hang on for just a minute.
- What are we gonna work out?

34:32.074 --> 34:35.804
You know that kid I've been tailing?
Denny Jenkins.

34:35.844 --> 34:38.279
- He's going to a rock concert.
- I'll do it.

34:38.313 --> 34:41.215
Are you sure now? Those kids are crazy.

34:41.250 --> 34:44.583
What they call dancing,
we used to do behind the gym.

34:44.620 --> 34:46.349
I'll do it.

34:46.388 --> 34:51.324
I can't pay you cash. I'll cut you in
on the action between me and Thomas.

34:51.360 --> 34:54.989
I gotta have the cash. I need it right away.

34:55.030 --> 34:56.998
OK, forget it.

34:57.933 --> 35:00.367
All right, all right. I'll do it.

35:00.402 --> 35:04.736
OK. I'll cut you in for 20%/% of my 75%/%.

35:04.773 --> 35:08.300
- 75 of the 75.
- 30.

35:08.344 --> 35:10.972
- 60.
- 40.

35:11.013 --> 35:13.004
50.

35:13.048 --> 35:16.711
- All right, I'll split the difference with you.
- You got it.

35:16.752 --> 35:18.617
When do I get the money?

35:18.654 --> 35:20.281
T. M. Says it's in the mail.

35:20.322 --> 35:24.156
Forget the mail.
I've gotta have your guarantee that I get it.

35:25.461 --> 35:28.191
- OK, you got it.
- Thanks.

35:28.230 --> 35:30.528
Here. Get to work.

35:33.836 --> 35:37.795
Hello, baby. Yes, dinner
at your place at eight.

35:38.841 --> 35:41.309
Hello? Hello?

35:43.712 --> 35:48.979
<i>Sorenson had beaten me so badly
that he invited me back the next day.</i>

35:49.018 --> 35:53.216
<i>Except this time I thought
I'd bring my own gallery.</i>

35:53.255 --> 35:57.919
<i>We were 40 years from Sand Island
but I knew it was as recent as yesterday</i>

35:57.960 --> 35:59.985
<i>for men like Goto</i>.

36:18.981 --> 36:20.505
There. That's him.

36:23.218 --> 36:25.345
Which one, Mr. Magnum?

36:27.222 --> 36:30.055
You wait here, I'll go talk to him.

37:22.854 --> 37:24.219
- Was it him?
- Yes.

38:15.012 --> 38:16.690
I've been waiting for you.

38:20.284 --> 38:22.309
It's the only gun I own.

38:22.352 --> 38:26.618
I use it for target shooting
and Sorenson wasn't the target.

38:28.425 --> 38:31.451
He wasn't killed with this anyway.

38:31.495 --> 38:33.463
He was shot from long range.

38:33.497 --> 38:37.831
You'd have to be pretty damn good
to hit him with this.

38:37.868 --> 38:40.302
How did you find out about Sorenson?

38:40.337 --> 38:44.967
I've been following you.
You can't get rid of me that easily.

38:45.008 --> 38:47.033
I went to Goto with his name.

38:47.077 --> 38:50.274
He finally told me how my grandfather died.

38:50.314 --> 38:52.748
And you followed us again today.

38:52.783 --> 38:55.013
With the gun.

38:55.752 --> 38:59.153
Hoping to find the courage
to kill him myself.

38:59.189 --> 39:03.888
But it's one thing to want to
and another thing to pull the trigger.

39:03.927 --> 39:06.919
As it turns out, I didn't have to decide.

39:12.436 --> 39:16.031
- Did you see anything?
- No more than you.

39:16.073 --> 39:20.305
One minute he was getting into his car,
the next he was dead.

39:21.245 --> 39:23.509
It's strange.

39:23.547 --> 39:26.607
I thought I'd feel elated or something.

39:26.650 --> 39:28.914
Instead, I just feel numb.

39:29.753 --> 39:31.516
Does that make any sense?

39:32.789 --> 39:34.484
It makes no sense at all.

39:34.524 --> 39:36.617
Sorenson and Enoka?

39:36.660 --> 39:41.097
Sorenson's thrown some lucrative
business deals Enoka's way.

39:41.131 --> 39:44.623
And contributed bucks
to his election campaign.

39:44.668 --> 39:48.126
Strange partners. Prisoner and his guard.

39:48.171 --> 39:52.039
And Sorenson has an axe to grind
with the Japanese.

39:52.075 --> 39:54.942
He lost two brothers at Pearl.

39:54.978 --> 39:58.379
What could two guys like this
have in common?

39:58.415 --> 40:00.645
Two minutes,
then I call my lawyer.

40:00.684 --> 40:04.677
Go ahead. Call him.
I'd be happy to give a deposition.

40:04.721 --> 40:09.090
You're working for the opposition.
It's a political dirty trick.

40:09.126 --> 40:13.756
Murder and blackmail go way beyond
political tricks. What's your lawyer's number?

40:15.666 --> 40:17.395
Look, it's all over.

40:17.434 --> 40:20.835
Sorenson's now dead.
Kirin Nakamura is long dead.

40:20.871 --> 40:22.930
And so is Sand Island.

40:22.973 --> 40:25.840
Perhaps we should let them all rest in peace.

40:25.876 --> 40:29.812
Besides, of what importance is this now,
particularly to you?

40:29.846 --> 40:34.476
Someone tried to kill Jonathan Higgins
after he talked to you about Sand Island.

40:35.419 --> 40:37.284
Someone? Or me?

40:37.321 --> 40:39.721
You're about the only one left.

40:39.756 --> 40:42.884
Not the only one. There's me and Goto.

40:42.926 --> 40:48.125
We both saw Nakamura being beaten to death
as Goto described to you.

40:48.165 --> 40:49.530
Goto phoned me.

40:49.566 --> 40:53.832
Our friendship and our silence
have endured many years.

40:53.870 --> 40:56.896
Does Goto know about
your deals with Sorenson?

40:56.940 --> 41:00.376
Goto's a simple fisherman.
He wouldn't understand.

41:00.410 --> 41:04.107
My dealings with Sorenson
were purely business.

41:04.147 --> 41:06.138
The other guard died on Guam.

41:06.183 --> 41:09.016
Goto believed Sorenson perished there also.

41:09.052 --> 41:12.783
- Until yesterday.
- Let me ask you something.

41:12.823 --> 41:14.848
If I had been blackmailing Sorenson,

41:14.891 --> 41:18.418
why would I kill the goose
which lays the golden egg?

41:18.462 --> 41:22.262
You're running for office.
If Sorenson decided to talk...

41:22.299 --> 41:25.598
And risk revealing himself
as the murderer he was?

41:25.635 --> 41:27.762
How very unlikely.

41:29.406 --> 41:32.705
- You couldn't be sure of that.
- Granted.

41:32.743 --> 41:36.201
But neither can you be certain
of everything you've said.

41:36.246 --> 41:38.680
One thing you can be certain of.

41:38.715 --> 41:43.345
If I had killed Sorenson,
I would tell you here, alone.

41:44.287 --> 41:48.383
And there wouldn't be a damn thing
you could do about it.

41:48.425 --> 41:51.952
You must excuse me.
I have to get back to the office.

41:53.230 --> 41:57.690
Ah. I hope you're registered to vote,
Mr. Magnum.

42:00.704 --> 42:02.695
Good day.

42:09.046 --> 42:11.412
<i>Enoka was very convincing</i>.

42:11.448 --> 42:15.316
<i>Until I remembered he was a politician</i>.

42:15.352 --> 42:19.846
<i>There was only one person
who had nothing to gain by lying.</i>

42:19.890 --> 42:24.486
<i>Unfortunately, it was also clear
I was headed in a direction</i>

42:24.528 --> 42:26.519
<i>I really didn't wanna go</i>.

42:38.241 --> 42:39.367
Thank you.

42:46.383 --> 42:49.375
- You knew I was coming.
- Yes.

42:51.354 --> 42:54.812
You must have been surprised
that Sorenson was alive.

42:54.858 --> 42:56.951
Yes, but that is over now.

42:56.993 --> 42:59.791
Sand Island is finished.

43:12.008 --> 43:14.203
Where is he?

43:31.261 --> 43:33.354
Goto, help me.

43:35.398 --> 43:40.131
Goto, this man is the only thing
standing between us and freedom.

43:40.170 --> 43:41.467
Use the gun.

43:43.607 --> 43:46.633
What kind of freedom are you talking about?

43:47.711 --> 43:50.009
Sorenson's dead.

43:50.046 --> 43:51.809
If you shoot me,

43:51.848 --> 43:55.784
you disgrace and diminish
the memory of Kirin Nakamura.

43:55.819 --> 43:59.255
Goto. Remember Sand Island.

44:13.770 --> 44:16.762
I have not forgotten Sand Island.

44:19.042 --> 44:21.169
Use the gun, Goto!

44:27.017 --> 44:28.951
Don't be an old fool.

44:29.653 --> 44:32.144
I am old, but you are the fool.

44:32.189 --> 44:34.214
And the coward.

44:34.891 --> 44:38.952
I am not afraid to face
the consequences of my silence.

44:38.995 --> 44:42.829
Anything less would dishonor me.
And Kirin Nakamura.

45:28.578 --> 45:30.569
T.C.?

45:31.448 --> 45:33.541
T.C.! Hey...

45:33.583 --> 45:38.020
Don't hurt the rent-a-tux.
In fact, here's the bill for it.

45:38.054 --> 45:40.147
What are you all dressed up for?

45:40.190 --> 45:41.589
The wedding.

45:41.625 --> 45:44.924
- What wedding?
- Denny and Elizabeth are getting married.

45:44.961 --> 45:49.193
Married? J. Rickley Schneider
is letting his daughter marry a...

45:49.232 --> 45:52.326
- Orchid grower.
- Orchid grower?

45:52.369 --> 45:55.361
That's what he was growing.
Some rare orchid.

45:55.405 --> 46:00.604
I got onto it, had a long talk with J. Rickley,
the old boy was delighted, so were the kids.

46:02.178 --> 46:05.011
What's that ringing?

46:05.048 --> 46:08.245
Hey, aren't you gonna ask
about my shoulder?

46:08.285 --> 46:11.686
- Hey, what's that ringing?
- It's Higgins. He's back.

46:11.721 --> 46:16.556
Ooh, Victor phoned about the car.
It was a faulty brake-line after all.

46:16.593 --> 46:18.493
Magnum, is that you?

46:22.932 --> 46:24.923
I hurt my...

46:27.270 --> 46:28.999
Magnum.

46:34.511 --> 46:36.445
Magnum.

46:36.479 --> 46:38.470
I say, Magnum.

46:42.385 --> 46:44.444
Magnum.

46:44.487 --> 46:46.955
Didn't you hear the bell?

46:50.393 --> 46:53.954
Dr. Ibold said I mustn't strain myself,

46:53.997 --> 46:56.591
at all, for at least a fortnight.

46:56.633 --> 46:58.965
Does that include your voice?

46:59.002 --> 47:02.233
He explained it to me very thoroughly.

47:03.506 --> 47:07.465
Apparently, it's some sort
of severe trauma to the back.

47:07.510 --> 47:09.444
You know how these things are.

47:09.479 --> 47:11.811
I'm beginning to get the picture.

47:11.848 --> 47:18.048
At any rate, I'll have to depend
on your services for a while.

47:18.088 --> 47:20.249
Higgins, I've been shot!

47:20.290 --> 47:25.318
The first order of business
is to feed the lads. They're ravenous.

47:25.362 --> 47:28.490
Don't worry. I've got just the thing for them.

47:28.531 --> 47:33.366
A little broiled chicken with butter
and garlic sauce would be nice.

47:33.403 --> 47:35.667
Actually, no.

47:35.705 --> 47:40.836
I've still got the rest
of that takeout order from Macho Taco.

47:42.178 --> 47:44.169
Shouldn't be too old.

47:44.214 --> 47:49.117
Macho Taco? For the lads?
Don't you dare.
