00:22.000 --> 00:27.233
BECAUSE YESTERDAY

00:29.967 --> 00:32.733

00:51.667 --> 00:53.067
THEY'RE DOWNSTAIRS
WATCHING CARTOONS.

00:53.067 --> 00:54.433

00:54.433 --> 00:57.233

THEY'RE IN THE ZONE, OKAY?

00:57.233 --> 00:59.167
WE'RE SAFE AS LONG

[bang on window]

01:04.233 --> 01:07.833
WHAT? IS THAT IT?

01:07.833 --> 01:10.400
- SOMETHING HIT
THE WALL.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.200
both: AAH!

01:17.200 --> 01:18.767
- JEEZ, YOU SCARED
THE CRAP OUT OF ME.

01:18.767 --> 01:21.900

01:25.033 --> 01:28.233

THE WORLD'S UGLIEST SHUTTERS.

01:33.767 --> 01:35.233
- LISTEN...

01:35.233 --> 01:38.267
FRANK, WE WERE GOING TO
HIRE PAINTERS TO DO THAT.

01:38.267 --> 01:42.600
- SO YOU CAN THANK ME LATER.
I LIKE FINE CHOCOLATES.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.467
- DAD, PLEASE,
GET DOWN FROM THERE, OKAY?

01:44.467 --> 01:47.167
WE'RE--WE'RE TRYING
TO SLEEP HERE.

01:47.167 --> 01:50.300

YEAH, I GOT YOU.

01:50.300 --> 01:54.200
A LITTLE, UH.
SATURDAY MORNING WAKE-ME-UP?

01:54.200 --> 01:56.767
JUST CLOSE THE WINDOW.
I WON'T LISTEN.

02:01.600 --> 02:04.067
- YOU KNOW, I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT THE LISTENING.

02:04.067 --> 02:06.133
IT'S THE HECKLING.

02:12.567 --> 02:14.600
- NOW, GET YOUR FATHER
OFF THAT LADDER, WOULD YOU?

02:14.600 --> 02:15.900
- OKAY.

02:15.900 --> 02:19.033
- WELL, LOOK WHO FINALLY DECIDED
TO GET OUT OF BED.

02:19.033 --> 02:20.933
- WHAT--MA?

02:20.933 --> 02:22.533
- IT'S 7:30, MARIE.

02:22.533 --> 02:25.400
- WELL, DEBRA, I WAS COMING OVER
HERE WITH FRENCH TOAST FOR FRANK

02:25.400 --> 02:28.100
AND THEN I NOTICED THAT
YOUR CHILDREN WERE STARVING.

02:28.100 --> 02:30.433
- YAY! FRENCH TOAST!
[children cheering]

02:30.433 --> 02:32.000
- OH. OH.

02:32.000 --> 02:34.133
MA, WHY IS DAD
PAINTING THE HOUSE?

02:34.133 --> 02:37.667
- OH,
THAT'S MY GIFT TO YOU.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.600
- WHAT?
- WELL,

02:39.600 --> 02:42.033
YOU TWO ALWAYS TALK ABOUT
HAVING YOUR HOUSE PAINTED,

02:42.033 --> 02:44.833
SO I PUT YOUR FATHER
ON THE JOB.

02:44.833 --> 02:48.400
- MARIE, WE WERE GOING
TO HIRE PROFESSIONALS.

02:48.400 --> 02:49.700
- OH, WELL,
FRANK IS VERY GOOD.

02:49.700 --> 02:51.800
HE DID A NICE JOB
ON OUR HOUSE,

02:51.800 --> 02:54.567
AND HE LIKES
THE FUMES.

02:54.567 --> 02:56.400
- MOM

02:56.400 --> 02:58.867
- WELL, YES, HE DID
DO A NICE JOB ON YOUR HOUSE,

02:58.867 --> 03:02.567
AND I WOULD HATE TO KILL
ANYONE'S BUZZ, BUT--

03:02.567 --> 03:04.233
- YEAH, BUT WE WERE
KIND OF THINKING

03:04.233 --> 03:06.367
THAT WE WOULD BE THE ONES
TO MAKE THAT DECISION,

03:06.367 --> 03:10.233
'CAUSE IT IS
KIND OF OUR HOUSE.

03:10.233 --> 03:13.367
- YES, BUT WE'RE THE ONES
WHO HAVE TO LOOK AT IT.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.133
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GOING
TO USE THIS FRENCH TOAST

03:17.133 --> 03:19.033
TO LURE HIM OFF THE LADDER.
- OKAY, OKAY,

03:19.033 --> 03:20.833
JUST LET
YOUR FATHER DO THIS.

03:20.833 --> 03:22.600
I NEED HIM
OUT OF MY HOUSE.

03:22.600 --> 03:26.867
EVER SINCE HE'S RETIRED,
HE'S AROUND ALL THE TIME.

03:26.867 --> 03:28.867
- BUT THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS
WHEN YOU RETIRE.

03:28.867 --> 03:31.733
- I KNOW, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT
HE'D LIVE THIS LONG.

03:34.800 --> 03:36.333
- COME ON, MA,
LOOK,

03:36.333 --> 03:38.433
THAT'S--THAT'S NOT
OUR PROBLEM, ALL RIGHT?

03:38.433 --> 03:40.433
YOU'VE HAD 40 YEARS
TO POISON HIM.

03:40.433 --> 03:43.833
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
RAYMOND, PLEASE.

03:43.833 --> 03:46.700
I NEED SPACE.
I NEED A LITTLE TIME TO MYSELF.

03:46.700 --> 03:49.267
I DON'T WANT HIM AROUND
WHEN I'M TRYING TO DO THINGS.

03:49.267 --> 03:50.733
- WHAT--
DO WHAT THINGS?

03:50.733 --> 03:54.333
- WHEN I'M TRYING
TO IMPROVE MYSELF.

03:54.333 --> 03:57.733
THIS DOESN'T JUST
HAPPEN.

03:59.133 --> 04:00.767
I MEAN,
I PRACTICE MY LANGUAGES,

04:00.767 --> 04:03.733
I HAVE MY OPERA,
AND I'M STARTING YOGA.

04:03.733 --> 04:05.333
- [laughs] YOU--

04:09.067 --> 04:11.467
- WHAT,
IS THAT SO STRANGE?

04:11.467 --> 04:12.933

04:12.933 --> 04:15.167
- HEY.

04:15.167 --> 04:17.200

04:26.233 --> 04:27.933
- COME ON, LOOK,

04:27.933 --> 04:30.300
I DON'T NEED BOTH OF YOU GUYS
HANGING OFF MY HOUSE, OKAY?

04:30.300 --> 04:31.633
SO GO BACK
IN YOUR TRUCK,

04:31.633 --> 04:35.333
RING A BELL,
AND SELL SOME FUDGE POPS.

04:38.567 --> 04:41.467

04:41.467 --> 04:44.800

SWEET OF YOU TO HELP.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.433
THANKS A LOT,

04:46.433 --> 04:47.967

04:47.967 --> 04:49.667

04:52.600 --> 04:54.067
- WELL, COME ON.

04:54.067 --> 04:55.867
- HEY, HEY HEY,

04:55.867 --> 04:57.800
TO GET ON THIS

04:57.800 --> 04:59.433

04:59.433 --> 05:01.000
YOU WANT TO PAINT THE HOUSE?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.400

05:02.400 --> 05:05.433
MAYBE ALL THREE OF YOU

05:05.433 --> 05:07.400

05:58.367 --> 06:00.167
SORRY, KIDS.
I GUESS DADDY

06:17.467 --> 06:18.967
I CAN'T TAKE
THE OLD MAN ANYMORE.

06:18.967 --> 06:20.967
HE'S DRIVING ME NUTS.

06:20.967 --> 06:22.500
ORDERING ME AROUND
LIKE A MONKEY.

06:22.500 --> 06:24.300

NANCY, POWDERPUFF,
PRINCESS, MONKEY.

06:28.733 --> 06:34.033
- SO I'M GETTING DOPEY,
IDIOT, MORON.

06:34.033 --> 06:36.067
AT LEAST
YOURS MAKE SENSE.

06:41.767 --> 06:43.133

YOU KNEW WHAT IT WAS GOING TO
BE LIKE WORKING WITH DAD.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.400
- I HAD HIM TOO,
RAYMOND.

06:53.400 --> 06:57.600
HE WAS UP
ON THE LADDER.

06:57.600 --> 07:01.333
WOULD'VE LOOKED LIKE
AN ACCIDENT.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.600
- HEY, WHAT'S WITH ALL THIS
STANDING AROUND?

07:03.600 --> 07:06.500

07:10.533 --> 07:13.767
BUT LET'S GET TO WORK!
CHOP, CHOP!

07:13.767 --> 07:15.500
- WE'RE WORKING, DAD.

07:15.500 --> 07:16.600
- OH, YEAH?

07:16.600 --> 07:19.300
ARE YOU FINISHED CAULKING,
LADY CHATTERLY?

07:20.700 --> 07:23.200
- THAT IS A GOOD ONE.

07:23.200 --> 07:25.267
- WHY AREN'T YOU DONE
CAULKING?

07:25.267 --> 07:27.600
- THERE'S A WASP'S NEST
BY THE DOWNSPOUT.

07:27.600 --> 07:30.633
- SO YOU TAKE A STICK
AND KNOCK IT DOWN.

07:30.633 --> 07:34.100
- THEY'RE WASPS.
THEY DON'T LIKE THAT.

07:34.100 --> 07:36.067
- OH, WELL,
HERE'S WHAT YOU DO.

07:36.067 --> 07:37.600
IF THEY COME AT YOU,

07:37.600 --> 07:40.767
YOU PULL YOUR SKIRT
OVER YOUR HEAD AND RUN.

07:40.767 --> 07:43.000
- ALL RIGHT.

07:43.000 --> 07:44.500
- HEY, DAD,
YOU KNOW,

07:44.500 --> 07:45.800
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO CAULK
BY THE DOWNSPOUT.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.167
IT'S NOT
THAT IMPORTANT.

07:47.167 --> 07:49.167
- IT'S IMPORTANT
IF I SAY IT'S IMPORTANT.

07:49.167 --> 07:51.700
- OKAY,
BUT THIS IS MY HOUSE.

07:51.700 --> 07:53.400
- AND THIS IS MY JOB.

07:53.400 --> 07:55.533
PEOPLE SEE ME
WORKING OUT HERE.

07:55.533 --> 07:58.533
THEY'RE GOING TO KNOW
THAT FRANK BARONE DID THIS JOB,

07:58.533 --> 08:01.300
SO IT'S GOING
TO GET DONE RIGHT.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.933
WHY ARE YOU
STILL HERE?

08:03.933 --> 08:05.467
- I-I-I DON'T THINK--

08:05.467 --> 08:07.833
- HEY, HEY,
IT'S JUST A COUPLE OF BUGS.

08:07.833 --> 08:09.600
KNOCK IT DOWN
WITH SOMETHING,

08:09.600 --> 08:12.633
A STICK, A BROOM...
YOUR BINKY.

08:12.633 --> 08:14.067
I DON'T CARE!

08:14.067 --> 08:16.167
GET UP THERE
AND KNOCK OUT THAT NEST!

08:16.167 --> 08:19.133
- ALL RIGHT!

08:24.067 --> 08:25.500
- AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

08:25.500 --> 08:27.300
ARE YOU GOING TO SCRAPE
THAT PAINT OR DO A DANCE?

08:27.300 --> 08:29.633
- I'M SCRAPING.

08:29.633 --> 08:31.733
WHOA. HEY,
WAIT A MINUTE, DAD.

08:31.733 --> 08:35.500
YOU GOT THE WRONG COLOR.
DEBRA WANTED WHITE.

08:35.500 --> 08:36.667
- THIS IS CLOSE.

08:36.667 --> 08:39.700
- IT'S NOT CLOSE.
IT'S YELLOW.

08:39.700 --> 08:43.000
OKAY, SHE WANTS WHITE.
SHE SAID CHANTILLY LACE.

08:43.000 --> 08:46.833
- WELL,
THIS IS LEMON MERINGUE.

08:46.833 --> 08:48.833
- WELL,
WHY DID YOU GET YELLOW?

08:48.833 --> 08:50.833
- BECAUSE YELLOW
IS BETTER.

08:50.833 --> 08:52.833
- YEAH,
BUT DEBRA LIKES WHITE.

08:52.833 --> 08:54.900
- WELL, I DON'T CARE
WHAT DEBRA LIKES,

08:54.900 --> 08:56.567
AND I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU LIKE.

08:56.567 --> 09:00.267
IT'S YELLOW, OKAY?
AND WE'RE DOING IT YELLOW.

09:00.267 --> 09:03.767
- [screams]
HOSE! GET THE HOSE!

09:03.767 --> 09:06.933
[screaming]

09:06.933 --> 09:09.467
- BIG BABY.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.833
- LISTEN, DAD,
I GOT TO TELL YOU.

09:13.833 --> 09:16.933
IT'S NOT ONLY DEBRA, OKAY?
I WANT CHANTILLY LACE TOO.

09:16.933 --> 09:18.500
DAD, DO YOU HEAR
WHAT I'M SAYING?

09:18.500 --> 09:20.133
DAD, DON'T PAINT

09:20.133 --> 09:24.233
DAD, DON'T YOU OPEN

09:24.233 --> 09:25.467
DAD,
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.

09:25.467 --> 09:27.733

09:29.867 --> 09:32.033
- DAD--DAD,
DON'T YOU STIR THAT PAINT.

09:32.033 --> 09:33.433
IF YOU STIR

09:52.067 --> 09:54.067
DAD, YOU DO NOT

09:54.067 --> 09:55.900
I'M WARNING YOU.
DAD, DON'T--

09:55.900 --> 09:58.600
OH--DAD, IF I SEE PAINT

OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

GO HOME.

10:13.133 --> 10:14.500
- EXCUSE ME?
- L-LOOK,

10:14.500 --> 10:15.767
IF YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO DO WHAT I WANT,

10:15.767 --> 10:17.233
THEN I DON'T WANT YOU HERE.
GO HOME.

10:17.233 --> 10:18.400
- YOU DON'T TELL ME
WHAT TO DO.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.867
- I DO
WHEN IT'S MY HOUSE.

10:19.867 --> 10:21.267
AND IT'S MY HOUSE,
AND I'M THE BOSS, OKAY?

10:21.267 --> 10:22.667
SO YOU'RE FIRED.

10:22.667 --> 10:24.033
- I'M FIRED?

10:24.033 --> 10:26.600
- OKAY,
I'M ALL RIGHT NOW.

10:26.600 --> 10:28.167
- HEY, GET A LOAD OF THIS,
ROBERT.

10:28.167 --> 10:29.400
RAYMOND SAYS
I'M FIRED.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.600
- THAT'S RIGHT,
YOU'RE FIRED!

10:30.600 --> 10:34.100
- YOU FIRED HIM?
YOU WANT TO FIRE ME?

10:35.433 --> 10:36.833
- YOU CAN'T FIRE ME.

10:36.833 --> 10:38.600
- LOOK, DAD,
I'M NOT A KID ANYMORE, OKAY?

10:38.600 --> 10:40.467
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
YOU TREAT ME,

10:40.467 --> 10:41.867
AND--AND I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
YOU TREAT THE HELP EITHER,

10:41.867 --> 10:43.733
SO THAT'S IT.

10:49.033 --> 10:50.200
- FINE.

10:50.200 --> 10:53.200
PAINT YOUR OWN
DAMN HOUSE.

10:58.533 --> 10:59.800
- WOW.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.200
- THAT'S RIGHT.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.367
AND NOW I'M IN CHARGE
OF THIS NOW, OKAY?

11:04.367 --> 11:07.067
AND THE FIRST THING
WE'RE GOING TO DO,

11:07.067 --> 11:09.067
LUNCH.

11:09.067 --> 11:10.767
- YEAH,
BUT IT'S ONLY 9:30--

11:10.767 --> 11:13.533
- LUNCH!
- YEAH, BUT--

11:13.533 --> 11:14.733
HEY, YOU CAN'T
COME IN LIKE THAT.

11:14.733 --> 11:17.167
YOU'RE SOAKING WET.

11:23.067 --> 11:24.333
- HERE I THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE SO NICE,

11:24.333 --> 11:26.433
ALL THE BARONE MEN
WORKING TOGETHER.

11:26.433 --> 11:29.800
- NO ONE WORKS WITH DAD.
YOU WORK FOR HIM.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.000
- 'CAUSE NOBODY CAN DO
ANYTHING RIGHT, EXCEPT HIM.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.800
- MM-HMM, YEAH.
REMEMBER THE FORT?

11:33.800 --> 11:35.233
- THAT'S RIGHT.

11:35.233 --> 11:37.633
ROBERT AND I WERE BUILDING
A FORT IN OUR BACK YARD.

11:37.633 --> 11:39.967
NOTHING FANCY.
JUST THIS LITTLE FORT.

11:39.967 --> 11:43.233
- YEAH, JUST A PLACE WHERE WE
CAN READ OUR COMIC BOOKS AND...

11:43.233 --> 11:45.467
OTHER PERIODICALS.

11:50.367 --> 11:53.900
- UGH.

11:53.900 --> 11:55.200
- WE WERE
HAVING FUN TOO,

11:55.200 --> 11:56.833
BUILDING THE FORT
ALL BY OURSELVES, RIGHT?

11:56.833 --> 11:59.367
TILL DAD CAME HOME AND TOLD US
WE WERE DOING IT ALL WRONG.

11:59.367 --> 12:02.000
- YEAH, HE DIDN'T SHOW US
HOW TO DO IT RIGHT.

12:02.000 --> 12:03.800
JUST CALLED US
STUPID STINKING HUMPS

12:03.800 --> 12:05.933
AND DID IT HIMSELF.

12:05.933 --> 12:07.633
THAT'S WHY
WHEN YOU GET MAD

12:07.633 --> 12:10.067
THAT I'M NOT THE HANDIEST GUY
AROUND HERE, YOU KNOW,

12:10.067 --> 12:13.000
IT BRINGS UP
A LOT OF STUFF.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.200
- OH,
I'M SORRY.

12:17.200 --> 12:18.900
SO IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU BEING LAZY

12:18.900 --> 12:21.333
AND WATCHING TV
ALL DAY?

12:22.700 --> 12:28.233
- THAT'S HOW I COVER
THE HURT.

12:28.233 --> 12:29.433
- HI, MARIE.

12:29.433 --> 12:30.933
- HELLO, DEAR.
- HIYA, MA.

12:30.933 --> 12:33.367
OH!

12:33.367 --> 12:35.267
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:35.267 --> 12:36.833
- THIS IS HOW YOU WATCH OUT
FOR YOUR FATHER?

12:36.833 --> 12:38.100
- WHAT DID I DO?

12:38.100 --> 12:39.367
- YOU MADE HIM
CARRY LADDERS AROUND.

12:39.367 --> 12:40.533
- HE DIDN'T
CARRY LADDERS.

12:40.533 --> 12:42.033
- THEN HOW DID HE
WRENCH HIS BACK?

12:42.033 --> 12:43.533
- WHAT?
- HE WRENCHED HIS BACK

12:43.533 --> 12:45.733
CARRYING LADDERS.
NOW HE'S LYING ON MY COUCH,

12:45.733 --> 12:48.333
DEMANDING SOUP.

12:48.333 --> 12:49.867
AND DON'T TELL HIM
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THIS.

12:49.867 --> 12:51.600
HE DIDN'T WANT ME TO MAKE
A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT.

12:51.600 --> 12:55.400
- SO WHY ARE YOU OVER HERE?
- I DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.833
- HIS BACK IS FINE, MA.
I SENT HIM HOME.

12:57.833 --> 12:59.133
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

12:59.133 --> 13:02.700
- HE WAS BEING A BIG JERK,
SO I FIRED HIM.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.233
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU FIRED HIM?

13:06.233 --> 13:08.067
YOU FIRED YOUR FATHER?

13:08.067 --> 13:10.267
- HAD TO BE DONE,
MA.

13:10.267 --> 13:12.800
- HOW COULD YOU
DO THAT TO HIM?

13:12.800 --> 13:15.133
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU MEAN HIM?
WHAT ABOUT WHAT HE DOES TO US?

13:15.133 --> 13:17.933
- WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT THAT.

13:17.933 --> 13:19.100
OH.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.433
I--OH, GOD.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.433
ALL RIGHT.

13:24.433 --> 13:27.267
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT
YOUR FATHER YOU DON'T KNOW.

13:31.233 --> 13:33.367
- HE WEARS
YOUR THINGS?

13:39.067 --> 13:40.567
- WHAT IS IT,
MARIE?

13:40.567 --> 13:45.267
- YOUR FATHER NEVER RETIRED
FROM PELK ACCOUNTING.

13:45.267 --> 13:46.833
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:46.833 --> 13:48.133
- IF HE'S NOT RETIRED,

13:48.133 --> 13:51.467
WHY DOES HE BUY HIS PANTS
AT THE PHARMACY?

13:51.467 --> 13:55.867
- HE TOLD ME HE RETIRED,
BUT I FOUND OUT THE TRUTH.

13:55.867 --> 13:57.900
THEY FIRED HIM.

13:57.900 --> 14:00.900
- WHAT? WHY?

14:00.900 --> 14:03.700
- WHY?
I HAVE TO TELL YOU?

14:08.700 --> 14:10.700
WHY DID YOU FIRE HIM?

14:10.700 --> 14:13.133
YOUR FATHER BELIEVES
THAT HIS WAY OF DOING THINGS

14:13.133 --> 14:15.533
IS THE ONLY WAY,
AND AFTER 25 YEARS,

14:15.533 --> 14:18.267
THAT STARTS
TO GET ON PEOPLE'S NERVES.

14:20.133 --> 14:22.533
- SO FRANK NEVER TOLD YOU
HE WAS FIRED?

14:22.533 --> 14:25.967
- HOW COULD HE?
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, DEBRA.

14:25.967 --> 14:28.000
IN MY GENERATION,

14:28.000 --> 14:31.633
THE MEN HAD THEIR JOBS,
AND THAT'S WHO THEY WERE.

14:31.633 --> 14:34.633
OH, IT MUST HAVE BEEN
SO HUMILIATING FOR FRANK

14:34.633 --> 14:38.667
TO HAVE THAT LITTLE ALVIN PELK
FIRE HIM FROM HIS JOB,

14:38.667 --> 14:42.167
AND NOW YOU BOYS JUST
DID THE SAME THING TO HIM.

14:45.167 --> 14:48.000
- IT WAS RAYMOND.

14:49.433 --> 14:52.500
- HEY,
YOU KNOW, COME ON.

14:52.500 --> 14:54.667
LOOK, THIS ISN'T
THE SAME THING, OKAY?

14:54.667 --> 14:57.367
THIS WASN'T HIS CAREER.
THIS WAS MY HOUSE.

14:57.367 --> 14:59.700
- WHAT ELSE DOES HE HAVE?
- YOUR HOUSE.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.000
- HE DID THAT ALREADY.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.933
- LOOK, MA, I THINK
YOU'RE OVERREACTING, OKAY?

15:02.933 --> 15:04.567
THIS WASN'T
THAT BIG A DEAL.

15:04.567 --> 15:06.867
- IT WAS A BIG ENOUGH DEAL FOR
HIM TO MAKE UP A STORY TO ME

15:06.867 --> 15:08.933
ABOUT HURTING HIS BACK.

15:08.933 --> 15:10.400
YOU'RE HIS SON.

15:10.400 --> 15:12.667
HOW DO YOU THINK
THAT MADE HIM FEEL?

15:12.667 --> 15:14.267
- I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY,
RAYMOND.

15:14.267 --> 15:16.600
- OH, SHUT UP.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.367
AND WHY SHOULD I WORRY
ABOUT HIS FEELINGS?

15:18.367 --> 15:20.100
HE DOESN'T CARE
ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE'S.

15:20.100 --> 15:22.933
- YOU DON'T THINK
HE CARES ABOUT YOU?

15:22.933 --> 15:26.333
HE'S YOUR FATHER.
HE JUST ISN'T GOOD AT, UH--

15:26.333 --> 15:29.867
- LIVING
AMONG HUMANS.

15:29.867 --> 15:31.300
- YOU KNOW,
I THINK YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

15:31.300 --> 15:33.733
WHO THINKS
YOU'RE FUNNY.

15:36.167 --> 15:39.367
- AMEN TO THAT.

15:39.367 --> 15:40.533
- COME ON, COME ON.
GO OVER ACROSS THE STREET--

15:40.533 --> 15:42.333
- NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, MA.

15:42.333 --> 15:44.333
LOOK, I'M SORRY
ABOUT HIS WHOLE LIFE, OKAY?

15:44.333 --> 15:46.267
BUT HE WAS
COMPLETELY WRONG HERE.

15:46.267 --> 15:48.133
HE WANTED
TO PAINT MY HOUSE YELLOW.

15:48.133 --> 15:50.100
- YELLOW?
- YEAH, YOU BELIEVE THAT?

15:50.100 --> 15:55.367
- WOW, ACTUALLY,
YELLOW WOULD BE KIND OF NICE.

15:55.367 --> 15:57.900
- WHAT?
- WELL, I LIKE YELLOW.

15:57.900 --> 15:59.600
- LOOK,
YOU SAID CHANTILLY LACE.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.500
I HEARD YOU SAY
"CHANTILLY LACE."

16:01.500 --> 16:03.433
I FOUGHT
FOR YOUR DAMN CHANTILLY LACE,

16:03.433 --> 16:05.133
AND NOW
YOU'RE SAYING YELLOW?

16:05.133 --> 16:08.100
WHO ARE YOU?

16:08.100 --> 16:11.367
- WHAT? YELLOW JUST
NEVER OCCURRED TO ME,

16:11.367 --> 16:13.567
BUT, YOU KNOW,
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF SUNNY.

16:13.567 --> 16:14.733
- [stutters]

16:14.733 --> 16:16.933
YOU HEAR THIS, OKAY?
THIS IS MARRIAGE.

16:16.933 --> 16:18.200
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT?

16:18.200 --> 16:20.800
THIS IS WHAT
YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT?

16:20.800 --> 16:23.267
- STEP ASIDE.

16:25.167 --> 16:26.833
- RAYMOND,
GO TALK TO YOUR FATHER.

16:26.833 --> 16:29.067
- NO, NO.
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD.

16:29.067 --> 16:30.567
- OH, EXCUSE ME,
WHO'S SPEAKING?

16:30.567 --> 16:33.933
IS THAT WHITE DEBRA
OR YELLOW DEBRA?

16:33.933 --> 16:35.433
- NO,
YOU REALLY SHOULD.

16:35.433 --> 16:36.933
LOOK, I KNOW YOUR FATHER
CAN BE A REAL JERK SOMETIMES.

16:36.933 --> 16:39.567
- RIGHT.
NO ONE IS ARGUING THAT.

16:39.567 --> 16:41.533
HE'S A BULLY,
AND HE'S OBSTINATE,

16:41.533 --> 16:44.533
AND HE DOESN'T
BATHE EVERY DAY,

16:44.533 --> 16:48.367
BUT I KNOW THAT MAN,
AND I KNOW HE NEEDS ONE THING.

16:49.367 --> 16:52.533
HE NEEDS
TO BE NEEDED.

16:54.433 --> 16:56.600
DO WITH THAT
WHAT YOU WILL.

17:04.400 --> 17:08.300
- HE'S YOUR FATHER.

17:15.467 --> 17:16.800
- HEY.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.067
- HEY.

17:20.633 --> 17:22.600
- LISTEN...

17:22.600 --> 17:27.333
I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE,
OKAY? SO...

17:27.333 --> 17:29.433
WANT TO COME BACK OVER?

17:29.433 --> 17:31.300
WE'LL DO IT YELLOW.
YELLOW'S OKAY.

17:31.300 --> 17:33.500
I TALKED DEBRA INTO IT.

17:35.867 --> 17:37.767
OKAY?

17:37.767 --> 17:39.367
- NO.

17:39.367 --> 17:42.300
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
NO?

17:42.300 --> 17:44.433
- I MEAN
I'M NOT INTERESTED.

17:44.433 --> 17:46.900
I'M KIND OF BUSY
RIGHT NOW.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.933
- OH.

17:48.933 --> 17:51.567
RIGHT, I SEE.
YOU GOT SOUP...

17:51.567 --> 17:54.633
AND A PUZZLE.

17:54.633 --> 17:56.233
WELL, IT DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE RIGHT NOW,

17:56.233 --> 17:57.967
WHENEVER
YOU FEEL LIKE IT.

17:57.967 --> 18:01.167
[clears throat]

18:01.167 --> 18:02.533
WHAT, ARE YOU EATING
OUT OF A POT

18:02.533 --> 18:06.433
'CAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE
TO CLEAN A BOWL?

18:06.433 --> 18:09.533
- NO, IT'S BETTER
THIS WAY.

18:09.533 --> 18:11.233
- OH.

18:13.333 --> 18:16.200
HEY, THAT'S A KEEN EYE
YOU GOT THERE.

18:18.167 --> 18:22.200
"THE DEATH OF
GENERAL STONEWALL JACKSON."

18:22.200 --> 18:24.133
LIKE THIS ONE?

18:24.133 --> 18:26.400
- VERY INTERESTING FIGURE
IN HISTORY.

18:26.400 --> 18:29.200
CONSIDERED THE CONFEDERACY'S
FINEST GENERAL.

18:29.200 --> 18:32.067
SHOT
BY ONE OF HIS OWN MEN.

18:33.167 --> 18:35.367
- ALL RIGHT.
WILL YOU STOP?

18:35.367 --> 18:37.300
GOD, I CAN'T BELIEVE
I INVITED YOU BACK.

18:37.300 --> 18:38.867
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I APOLOGIZED TO YOU, EVEN.

18:38.867 --> 18:41.600
- WELL, YOU SHOULD APOLOGIZE
TO ME. I WAS RIGHT.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.000
- HOW ARE YOU RIGHT?
HOW ARE YOU RIGHT?

18:44.000 --> 18:45.900
IT'S MY HOUSE, AND YOU
WANTED TO PAINT IT YELLOW.

18:45.900 --> 18:49.167
HOW IS THAT RIGHT?
- BECAUSE YELLOW COVERS BETTER!

18:49.167 --> 18:51.267
IT WON'T FADE
AS FAST.

18:51.267 --> 18:54.500
AND YOU GOT WHITE HOUSES
ON EITHER SIDE OF YOU.

18:54.500 --> 18:57.367
IT MAKES YOUR HOUSE
POP A LITTLE!

18:57.367 --> 18:58.633
AND IT GOES
WITH YOUR TRIM

18:58.633 --> 19:02.500
AND THE FRIGGIN'
LITTLE DAISIES YOU GOT!

19:05.800 --> 19:08.267
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T
YOU JUST SAY THAT?

19:08.267 --> 19:09.833
- I SHOULDN'T
HAVE TO SAY IT.

19:09.833 --> 19:11.100
- WHAT?

19:11.100 --> 19:12.333
- BECAUSE IF I SAY
IT'S YELLOW,

19:12.333 --> 19:14.067
THAT SHOULD BE
GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU!

19:14.067 --> 19:16.233
I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING!

19:16.233 --> 19:17.700
I'M RIGHT!

19:17.700 --> 19:19.500
- [scoffs]

19:19.500 --> 19:20.733
- OKAY, YOU'RE RIGHT,
BUT YOU KNOW,

19:20.733 --> 19:22.200
IT'S NOT ALWAYS
ABOUT BEING RIGHT.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.400
- YES, IT IS.

19:23.400 --> 19:25.133
BEING RIGHT
IS ALL THAT MATTERS.

19:25.133 --> 19:28.333
EVERYTHING ELSE IS CRAP.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.233
- "OH, YOU HAVE TO CONSIDER
PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.

19:31.233 --> 19:33.933
OH, WHAT IF
THEY DON'T LIKE YOU?"

19:33.933 --> 19:36.867
THEY SHOULD LIKE ME
BECAUSE I DID THE JOB RIGHT.

19:36.867 --> 19:41.067
- YEAH, THAT MAKES PERFECT SENSE
IF YOU WORK IN A LIGHTHOUSE.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.433
- EXACTLY.

19:44.433 --> 19:46.533
I'D BE FINE
IF IT WEREN'T FOR PEOPLE.

19:46.533 --> 19:48.433
- YEAH, OH,
IT'S THOSE DAMN PEOPLE, HUH?

19:48.433 --> 19:49.600
WELL, YOU'RE FORGETTING
ONE THING,

19:49.600 --> 19:52.333
ME AND ROBERT
ARE PEOPLE TOO.

20:07.633 --> 20:09.100
- SO WHAT, ARE THE TWO OF YOU
GOING TO

20:09.100 --> 20:11.467
PAINT THE HOUSE NOW
BY YOURSELVES?

20:11.467 --> 20:14.100
- YEAH.

20:16.267 --> 20:19.100
- IF YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU,
I'LL HELP YOU.

20:21.333 --> 20:23.333
- OKAY.

20:23.333 --> 20:25.500
- BUT IF YOU'RE ASKING
FOR MY HELP,

20:25.500 --> 20:29.633
WE GOT TO DO IT MY WAY,
BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT WAY.

20:29.633 --> 20:30.833
- ALL RIGHT.

20:30.833 --> 20:31.833

WITH THE YELLOW.

20:33.567 --> 20:36.167

WHAT TO DO.

I GET TO BE IN CHARGE.

20:37.600 --> 20:40.100
I GET TO BE THE BOSS.
ALL RIGHT?

20:40.100 --> 20:41.933

USE THE POWER PAINTER?

20:59.433 --> 21:01.333

THE POWER PAINTER TOO.

21:01.333 --> 21:03.867
- LEARN HOW TO HANDLE
A BRUSH FIRST.

21:03.867 --> 21:05.833

HOW TO HANDLE A BRUSH.

21:05.833 --> 21:08.367
- ARE YOU
QUESTIONING ME?

21:08.367 --> 21:10.600
- NO.

21:10.600 --> 21:12.467
SIR.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.000
