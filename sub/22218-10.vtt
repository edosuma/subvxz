00:10.802 --> 00:12.762

00:12.846 --> 00:14.806

00:14.889 --> 00:17.392
to assign all teams
for this flash challenge.

00:17.475 --> 00:18.601
- It's game day.
Deal with it.

00:19.936 --> 00:23.773

bottom of the pole right now.

<i>with fire and got burned.</i>

00:26.943 --> 00:29.904

Dave and Marisa.

00:29.988 --> 00:31.406
- Priority list.
Craig worst.

00:31.489 --> 00:31.781
It's retaliation, right?

00:31.865 --> 00:34.367

00:36.077 --> 00:37.537
{\an1}- Where do you want
your piece at?

00:37.620 --> 00:39.038

00:39.122 --> 00:42.250
<i>announcer: Dave and Marisa</i>
<i>used Chris's strategy.</i>

00:42.333 --> 00:44.294

00:44.377 --> 00:45.295
{\an1}- Sounds like you have
a plan here.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.630
- It's obvious Dave's
just a puppet for Chris.

00:47.714 --> 00:49.966
I have new targets now.

00:50.049 --> 00:52.051
- Dave did what he did.
He's gonna pay for that.

<i>- Chris has all of these guys</i>
<i>on strings.</i>

<i>- Craig.</i>

01:03.188 --> 01:06.357
- This color palette
is vastly unappealing.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.109

I made bad decisions.

01:08.193 --> 01:09.986
-<i> Duffy.</i>

01:10.069 --> 01:12.155
- It doesn't look like hands.
This looks like a bag of udders.

I haven't been myself

01:13.782 --> 01:15.492
these last couple days.

01:15.575 --> 01:18.369

read as Neptune.

01:18.453 --> 01:20.163
<i>- Tyler, your tattoo</i>
<i>has a bad drawing</i>

01:20.246 --> 01:21.790
<i>and bad execution.</i>

01:21.873 --> 01:23.792

everything together really fast

01:23.875 --> 01:25.376

01:25.460 --> 01:26.127

01:26.211 --> 01:28.171
- Do you want to go home, man?

01:28.254 --> 01:30.215
- Marisa,
this tattoo, for me,

01:30.298 --> 01:33.092
is the worst
as far as saturation goes.

01:33.176 --> 01:36.262

you must work in teams of three.

mess this Dodge Challenger up.

what we're working with.

{\an8}<i>- Today these artists</i>
<i>are gonna be working in teams.</i>

07:20.106 --> 07:22.942
{\an8}Collaboration is going
to be the major spirit,

07:23.025 --> 07:24.610
{\an8}as well as artistry.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.028

07:26.112 --> 07:27.738

Totally.

fly on a major, major vehicle.

07:31.576 --> 07:34.120
[rock music]

if we maybe did, like, a fade.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.250

and then did,

07:39.333 --> 07:41.210
like, a tribal over that.

a tattoo artist did not do.

paint the real flames?

07:49.802 --> 07:52.597
Not hot rod flames, but the ones
that look like real flames?

07:52.680 --> 07:53.681
{\an8}I'm the only one
that's done body paint on a car.

07:53.764 --> 07:56.267
{\an8}I'm the only one
that's an expert in this field.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.852
Paint 'em individually.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.729
{\an7}Kind of like a stencil.
You know what I'm saying?

07:59.812 --> 08:01.397
{\an8}- Chris thinks everyone
here is stupid.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.565
I'm not stupid.

08:02.648 --> 08:04.442
- Does that make sense?

08:04.525 --> 08:06.652
- I definitely see that Chris
definitely cannot be trusted.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.238
{\an1}- I would take off the whole
hood and draw it on the paint.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.032

keep him in front of me

08:11.115 --> 08:13.576
in clear, plain view.

08:13.659 --> 08:17.914

bumper [bleep] orange and red.

08:17.997 --> 08:20.750
{\an8}It's a muscle car.
We got to make this look mean.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.586
We want it to look like it's
hauling ass standing still.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.672
The goal is to turn the car
into a bomber.

08:26.756 --> 08:28.424
Boom.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.384
Last week I lost my [bleep]
chick 'cause she got sent home.

it this way.

08:37.600 --> 08:39.434

08:55.534 --> 08:56.869
Don't tell me how to do mine.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.663

08:58.746 --> 09:00.998
{\an1}and then we can use one
of those big cardboard sheets

09:01.082 --> 09:03.167
{\an1}while you paint the other stuff
to hold over it.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.170
- Let me do what I do.

09:08.047 --> 09:11.968
[dramatic music]

09:12.051 --> 09:14.011
- I think, like,
underwater of some sort, like,

09:14.095 --> 09:15.513
or even,
like, Japanese-style tattoos.

09:15.596 --> 09:19.141
{\an8}Everyone's just totally
over-thinking this,

09:19.225 --> 09:20.643
{\an8}and I'm trying to come up
with something

09:20.726 --> 09:23.104
{\an8}that we can accomplish
in this short amount of time.

09:23.187 --> 09:25.398
- I keep going back in my brain
to having some sort of, like,

09:25.481 --> 09:27.817
overall gradient on the car.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.986
- I really thought
we had a powerful team here.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.195
{\an1}- If we did flames, you
could do, like, a little shadow

09:31.279 --> 09:33.990
under each finger of the flame.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.157
- Well, I can tell you this.
I can definitely draw

09:35.241 --> 09:37.285
the [bleep] out of some [bleep]
badass [bleep] flames.

09:37.368 --> 09:39.453

10:39.972 --> 10:41.640

13:58.337 --> 14:00.339
- Dave.
- Yes.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.591
He gave me the roughest day
I've had since I've been here.

of put the three of us down,

14:05.302 --> 14:06.428

should go after them.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.931

- I truly think he doesn't
have any respect for me.

something that's gonna rattle.

to return the favor.

14:15.688 --> 14:16.772

to concede on this one--

18:21.767 --> 18:23.352
- This is your artist.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.478
{\an8}- If I can lay low through this

18:24.561 --> 18:26.522
{\an8}and just let my work
speak for itself,

18:26.605 --> 18:27.648
{\an8}that's what I want to do.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.483
- Canvases, one by one,

18:29.566 --> 18:33.654
please read the artist's name
on the bottom of your skull.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.656
- Duffy.

18:35.739 --> 18:37.032
- Chris.

18:37.115 --> 18:38.909
- Craig.

18:38.992 --> 18:40.327
<i>- Craig and I decide</i>
<i>we're gonna go head-to-head.</i>

18:40.410 --> 18:42.120
{\an8}He's about to find out
what it's like to be challenged

18:42.204 --> 18:43.664
{\an8}by somebody that knows
what they're doing.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.625
- Kruseman.

18:46.708 --> 18:47.876
- Matt.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.506
- Dave.

18:54.883 --> 18:58.720
{\an8}- I have to do a color lion on
a girl whose complexion is dark,

18:58.804 --> 19:00.848
{\an8}which limits my color palette
tremendously.

19:00.931 --> 19:03.600
I'm [bleep] bummed out.

19:03.684 --> 19:04.351
- Erik.

19:04.434 --> 19:06.687
- Tyler.

19:08.564 --> 19:09.857
- Katie.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.024
<i>- God damn it.</i>

19:11.108 --> 19:11.900
{\an8}I know I'm gonna be able
to talk my canvas

19:11.984 --> 19:14.528
{\an8}out of putting it on his ribs,

19:14.611 --> 19:16.280
{\an8}but I still have to spend
drawing time doing that.

19:19.241 --> 19:21.535
- Remember,
after the elimination tattoo,

19:21.618 --> 19:22.911
the human canvas jury
will vote on the tattoo

19:22.995 --> 19:26.164
that they think is the worst,

19:26.248 --> 19:27.791
and put one artist
up for elimination.

19:27.875 --> 19:31.086
You'll have six hours

19:31.169 --> 19:33.297
to create an anatomical
heart morph tattoo,

19:33.380 --> 19:37.676
and based on your work,
one of you will close shop.

19:37.759 --> 19:40.596
Good luck.

19:40.679 --> 19:42.180
- Hello.
- What's up, man?

19:42.264 --> 19:44.433
{\an8}- Let's go up here,
and let's talk about it.

19:44.516 --> 19:47.352
{\an8}- For this elimination tattoo,
everybody has to take two images

19:47.436 --> 19:49.479
{\an8}and not just collage
them together,

19:49.563 --> 19:50.939
{\an8}but morph them together.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.358
- I was picturing
the grenade exploding.

19:53.442 --> 19:56.028
<i>- You've got to be able</i>
<i>to draw this from scratch.</i>

19:56.111 --> 19:59.573
This is all about your artistry.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.450
{\an3}- One side I'm gonna have
the grenade

20:01.533 --> 20:03.869
and then the heart part
kind of separate.

20:03.952 --> 20:05.245
- You want it on your ribs?
- Yes.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.164
{\an8}- I have to move the placement.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.666
If you've never sat
through a rib tattoo before,

20:09.750 --> 20:12.169
it's definitely risky.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.379
<i>They think that they're</i>
<i>giving me a hard canvas.</i>

20:14.463 --> 20:17.132
Little do they know
that I'm the canvas whisperer.

20:17.215 --> 20:18.592
<i>This guy thinks he's</i>
<i>getting a tattoo on his ribs.</i>

20:18.675 --> 20:21.094
No, he's not.

20:21.178 --> 20:24.056
Would you be willing
to change the spot at all?

20:26.433 --> 20:27.184
{\an1}- Yes.
That's fine, yeah.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.311
{\an3}- Cool.
Okay, okay, okay, cool.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.604
I told you so.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.147
- Black and gray, color?

20:32.230 --> 20:35.067
I'm doing color,
and I want a female lioness.

20:35.150 --> 20:36.610
{\an8}- Uh...
There are so many things

20:36.693 --> 20:38.028
{\an8}working against me right now.

20:38.111 --> 20:39.655
She's got darker complexion,

20:39.738 --> 20:41.198
and on top of that
she wants a female lion.

20:41.281 --> 20:44.743
<i>It's gonna look</i>
<i>like a panther or a cougar.</i>

20:44.826 --> 20:46.328
A lion needs a mane.

20:46.411 --> 20:48.455
Are you open to a male lion?

20:49.915 --> 20:52.334
- Okay.
- Awesome.

20:52.417 --> 20:54.378
<i>Chris told me that he would try</i>
<i>to protect me,</i>

20:54.461 --> 20:56.421
but it looks like it doesn't
mean jack [bleep]

to this competition.

<i>Craig, I knew you</i>

- All right, let's get this

21:55.856 --> 21:57.858
- Stay super still.

21:57.941 --> 21:59.735
{\an8}- Blending two images takes
really strong artistry,

21:59.818 --> 22:00.652
{\an8}and this is one
of those challenges

22:00.736 --> 22:02.487
{\an8}where if the drawing
doesn't look good,

22:09.411 --> 22:11.413
<i>- This is where</i>

22:11.496 --> 22:13.081
Now any tattoo these guys do

or send 'em home.

22:15.333 --> 22:18.336

22:18.420 --> 22:20.839
- Just that part

22:20.922 --> 22:22.591
That's, like, taking up
a good part of my space.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.885
What about on the other side?
Would that be a possibility?

22:24.968 --> 22:27.679

where I have more space
to work with and I can maybe

22:35.020 --> 22:36.605
leave it about this size.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.690

just--like, a little bit smaller

22:38.774 --> 22:40.442

on the arm?

22:40.525 --> 22:44.488

roll over in this competition.

I only intended for one person

23:20.899 --> 23:22.234
<i>I baked a really nice cake.</i>

23:23.360 --> 23:24.611
I'm just waiting for that thing

23:24.694 --> 23:26.988
to get done cooking so
I can put some frosting on it

23:27.072 --> 23:28.740
and enjoy it for later.

{\an8}because I'm working my ass off
to come up with something

23:40.418 --> 23:43.880
{\an8}unique and different to put me
above Matt and Kruseman.

23:45.257 --> 23:46.842
{\an3}- What are we morphing
into over here?

23:46.925 --> 23:50.512
{\an3}- A lion and a heart with
external and internal views.

23:50.595 --> 23:51.179
<i>Everybody else</i>
<i>is doing externals.</i>

23:51.263 --> 23:54.015
Nobody did an internal.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.852
That'd be a cool way to bring
the lion's hair throughout.

23:56.935 --> 24:00.063
This whole time
I've had to battle with my PTSD

24:00.147 --> 24:03.900
from years of explosions and
range time with the military.

<i>That is what being</i>

<i>Being a good tattoo artist.</i>

24:14.452 --> 24:16.997
Never settling for second best.

24:21.376 --> 24:23.044
with a lion's face
hanging off the edge.

24:23.128 --> 24:24.713
- There's a ball sack
on the face.

24:24.796 --> 24:25.839

a little ball sack.

{\an8}- Dave doesn't
stand a chance today.

Final hour.

<i>[dramatic music]</i>

24:37.642 --> 24:39.060

{\an8}together, my goal is
to make it look like the clock

24:50.864 --> 24:53.575
{\an8}and heart pieces
are made out of each other.

24:53.658 --> 24:56.870
I've gone head-to-head

I'm a better artist than him.

'em you're a strong artist,

35:11.192 --> 35:13.694

someone in the bottom,

{\an8}- We're here to determine who
had the worst tattoo of the day.

<i>- And the explosion part</i>
<i>kind of looks like</i>

that float around.

35:37.635 --> 35:40.054
[laughter]

35:40.137 --> 35:43.683
- Duffy's would be so
much better if it was colored.

35:44.809 --> 35:47.854
- That is my tattoo,
and my artist was Kruseman.

35:47.937 --> 35:49.230
- I can't really tell
where the lion is.

35:49.313 --> 35:50.481
<i>Like, he went through</i>
<i>the transporter</i>

<i>and broke up, and there's</i>
<i>parts all over the heart.</i>

35:52.358 --> 35:55.361
- It looks like a deformed skull
with the veins all over it.

35:55.444 --> 35:58.990
- It almost looks like the lion
exploded apart into the heart.

35:59.073 --> 36:02.410
- It's definitely different.

36:02.493 --> 36:05.079
