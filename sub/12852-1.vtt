WEBVTT

03:23.088 --> 03:25.453
What do you think, Irving?

03:25.491 --> 03:27.388
He makes this
cheap dago move on me...

03:27.424 --> 03:28.857
Bo Weinberg...

03:28.892 --> 03:31.293
the man
who took out Vincent Coll...

03:31.327 --> 03:33.294
the man who held
Jack Diamond's ears...

03:33.328 --> 03:35.319
so he could put the gun
in his mouth...

03:35.364 --> 03:38.058
who found the rackets
he was too stupid to find...

03:38.099 --> 03:39.395
who made him something more...

03:39.433 --> 03:41.366
than the lowdown
fucking ganef that he is.

03:41.400 --> 03:43.061
The schmuck.
I should expect something else.

03:43.101 --> 03:44.897
He pulls me off the street
in front of my girl...

03:44.938 --> 03:47.906
like he don't know no better.
Schmuck.

03:47.940 --> 03:49.930
Don't talk to Irving.

03:51.875 --> 03:53.569
Talk to me.

03:53.610 --> 03:56.271
Men talk.
If they are men, they talk.

03:56.311 --> 03:58.005
They have a disagreement,
they discuss things.

03:58.045 --> 03:59.444
But you, I don't know, Dutch...

03:59.480 --> 04:01.708
I don't know what stinking
womb of pus and scum...

04:01.748 --> 04:03.612
and ape shit you came out of.

04:03.651 --> 04:06.847
You should understand
I am past the madness part.

04:06.885 --> 04:08.784
I am past the anger.

04:08.820 --> 04:10.377
Don't waste your breath.

04:10.421 --> 04:12.083
You never
paid your debts, Dutch.

04:12.123 --> 04:13.317
You never paid me
what I was worth...

04:13.356 --> 04:14.654
you never paid nobody
what they was worth.

04:16.259 --> 04:19.385
Hey, Bo, look
who came along for the ride.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.361
The more I done for you,
the more like a brother...

04:21.394 --> 04:22.863
I was to you,
the least I counted.

04:22.897 --> 04:25.125
I saved your life
a dozen times!

04:25.165 --> 04:27.325
Hey, kid, you like boats?

04:27.365 --> 04:28.957
I don't know yet.

04:29.001 --> 04:30.228
Protected you!

04:31.503 --> 04:32.800
I did your shit work...

04:32.836 --> 04:34.565
and I did it
like a professional.

04:34.605 --> 04:37.438
You always
had a way with words, Bo.

04:37.474 --> 04:38.963
You got more words than me...

04:39.009 --> 04:40.997
being I haven't been
to high school...

04:41.042 --> 04:43.636
but I got a good head
for current events...

04:43.678 --> 04:45.702
so I guess it all evens out.

04:45.745 --> 04:47.371
What's even?!

04:47.414 --> 04:50.042
I made you a millionaire!
I handed you a fortune!

04:50.082 --> 04:51.844
You got more money
than you know what to do with!

04:51.883 --> 04:54.409
I built this organization-
the beer, the unions...

04:54.453 --> 04:56.181
the numbers,
$20 million a year...

04:56.219 --> 04:58.413
you'd run it like
some goddamn candy store!

05:00.090 --> 05:02.249
Look at it this way, Bo.

05:02.291 --> 05:04.120
I'm the one sitting here...

05:04.158 --> 05:06.250
and you're
the one sitting there.

05:06.292 --> 05:09.693
Who would you rather be
at this moment?

05:12.799 --> 05:14.731
Come on.

05:14.765 --> 05:17.257
It's all right, Irving.

05:17.302 --> 05:18.961
You can bring her up.

05:19.003 --> 05:20.663
No!

05:20.705 --> 05:22.672
No, Dutch!

05:22.707 --> 05:26.639
Feeling better?

05:26.673 --> 05:30.542
You can sit her
down there, Irving.

05:31.777 --> 05:33.711
Come here.

05:33.747 --> 05:38.375
This is
a very good malt whiskey.

05:38.416 --> 05:40.884
Go ahead,
it'll settle your stomach.

05:40.918 --> 05:42.909
This is between me and you.
Leave her out of it.

05:47.221 --> 05:51.658
Bravo, sweetheart. Bravo.

05:51.691 --> 05:54.319
You know what you're doing,
don't you?

05:54.360 --> 05:57.660
I'll bet you know how to do
just about everything.

05:57.697 --> 06:00.129
Dutch, for Christ's sakes,
it's over, it's done.

06:00.163 --> 06:02.461
Did you say something, Bo?

06:02.500 --> 06:05.730
You can see the trouble
your Bo is in...

06:05.769 --> 06:07.237
right, Bo?

06:07.270 --> 06:10.725
Show her how you can't
do certain things anymore.

06:10.771 --> 06:12.569
Show her
how the simplest thing...

06:12.607 --> 06:15.870
like crossing your legs
or scratching your nose...

06:15.909 --> 06:18.240
it can't be done anymore by you.

06:18.277 --> 06:22.302
Sure, he can scream,
he can shout...

06:22.346 --> 06:24.644
but he can't lift his foot.

06:24.683 --> 06:26.774
He can't open his fly.

06:26.817 --> 06:28.809
He can't tell you
what time it is.

06:28.853 --> 06:31.683
Little by little,
he's taken leave of his life.

06:31.718 --> 06:34.779
Irving, is there a cabin?

06:34.822 --> 06:36.789
Down below aft.

06:36.822 --> 06:38.153
The back end.

06:40.426 --> 06:44.451
Mr. Class Act, Bo Weinberg,
moves against his best friend...

06:44.496 --> 06:49.228
against the man he works for.
That's class.

06:49.266 --> 06:51.461
All right, miss,
if you'd be so kind.

06:51.502 --> 06:52.833
Dutch.

06:54.802 --> 06:57.533
So, tell me, I'm just curious...

06:57.571 --> 06:59.539
when did you two meet?

06:59.572 --> 07:02.006
How long have
you and Bo been lovebirds?

07:02.041 --> 07:03.771
Just this way, miss.

07:03.809 --> 07:06.642
I have not had the pleasure
of meeting you before...

07:06.677 --> 07:08.838
but it is clear
that Bo is in love.

07:08.881 --> 07:11.542
It's clear that he's...

07:11.581 --> 07:12.843
Irving.

07:14.384 --> 07:16.044
Put me out, Irving.

07:17.353 --> 07:20.343
I'm begging you,
put the muzzle to my head.

07:20.387 --> 07:23.481
I can't do that, Bo.

07:23.523 --> 07:25.855
Please, Irving.

07:25.892 --> 07:28.326
Sorry.

07:28.360 --> 07:30.487
I could give you a drink.

07:30.528 --> 07:33.963
Want a drink, Bo?

07:46.072 --> 07:48.132
You listen to me, kid.

07:48.175 --> 07:51.233
You take some advice
from old Bo Weinberg.

07:51.277 --> 07:56.236
This man of yours
ain't gonna last long.

07:56.281 --> 07:59.113
He's obsolete.

07:59.149 --> 08:01.478
You know what that means?

08:02.950 --> 08:05.316
It means he's finished,
he's done.

08:05.352 --> 08:07.411
He's up against
tougher guys than him...

08:07.455 --> 08:09.854
and they're better organized.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.753
If you're as smart
as they say you are...

08:11.791 --> 08:13.586
you'll look out for yourself.

08:13.623 --> 08:16.252
You'll listen
to old Bo Weinberg.

08:27.367 --> 08:29.891
How'd you get into this, kid?

08:29.936 --> 08:32.928
Juggling.

08:32.972 --> 08:35.871
It was juggling got me into it.

08:46.815 --> 08:49.510
There ain't been a beer truck
around here for weeks.

08:49.551 --> 08:50.915
What the hell does that mean?

08:50.952 --> 08:52.077
What are you, stupid?

08:52.119 --> 08:53.676
No, I ain't stupid.
What does it mean?

08:53.721 --> 08:55.483
It means we could sit here
till the cows come home.

08:55.521 --> 08:56.716
The Dutchman's hiding out.

08:56.755 --> 08:58.550
Dutch Schultz
don't hide from nobody.

08:58.589 --> 08:59.920
The heat is on.

08:59.958 --> 09:01.891
Joey's brother
works for Dutch Schultz...

09:01.925 --> 09:03.291
and he said the heat is on.

09:03.327 --> 09:04.793
Joey Faye's brother?

09:04.827 --> 09:06.488
How'd he get a job
working for Schultz?

09:06.530 --> 09:07.791
- He caught on.
- How?

09:07.830 --> 09:09.422
I don't know. He caught on.

09:09.464 --> 09:10.691
Dutch took notice.

09:10.730 --> 09:12.666
Yeah, Schultz noticed him.

09:12.701 --> 09:14.826
Give me a cigarette.

09:14.868 --> 09:17.097
Ladies and gentlemen, I have
the pleasure to present...

09:17.137 --> 09:19.001
the Phantom,
the world's greatest juggler.

09:19.038 --> 09:20.663
The world's greatest jerk.

09:20.707 --> 09:22.366
He has come to us directly
from a tour...

09:22.406 --> 09:24.306
of the crowned heads
of Europe...

09:24.342 --> 09:27.640
and he will juggle
not one, not two...

09:27.677 --> 09:30.407
not three, but four balls.
Count them.

09:33.981 --> 09:35.744
This is
never before attempted...

09:35.782 --> 09:37.216
in the Bronx, New York, USA.

09:37.251 --> 09:38.944
You can join
a circus now, Billy.

09:38.985 --> 09:40.384
Hey, shut up. Look.

09:40.418 --> 09:43.285
You can marry a seal,
or something.

09:46.657 --> 09:47.852
That's him.

09:47.892 --> 09:49.382
- That's Schultz.
- Oh, my God.

09:49.425 --> 09:50.687
He drives a black Packard.

09:50.727 --> 09:52.490
- How do you know?
- He's got a gun.

09:52.529 --> 09:54.017
Everybody knows.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.527
I'm telling you,
it's very simple...

09:57.565 --> 10:00.088
but I think I've got
this whole thing under control.

10:00.132 --> 10:01.793
Then do it, Counselor.
Pay them off.

10:01.833 --> 10:05.292
- Look at that kid.
- What's he doing?

10:20.514 --> 10:23.447
Hey, kid, come here.

10:23.482 --> 10:25.748
Come here.

10:25.785 --> 10:27.546
Arthur.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.984
Arthur, can I just
finish this point...

10:29.020 --> 10:30.988
I'm trying to make?
It's very simple.

10:31.022 --> 10:32.990
I know you don't like
to talk about money...

10:33.023 --> 10:35.718
but I need about 10,000 more
to cover these guys.

10:35.759 --> 10:37.692
I realize it seems like a lot.

10:37.726 --> 10:39.556
$10,000 is a lot of money...

10:39.594 --> 10:42.391
but these are the best
attorneys on the east coast.

10:42.428 --> 10:43.827
They have
a lot of connections...

10:43.864 --> 10:45.354
and if we do happen
to go to trial...

10:45.398 --> 10:46.659
This doesn't go to trial.

10:46.699 --> 10:48.462
I know we're not going
to trial.

10:54.072 --> 10:56.436
A capable boy.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.772
Arthur, look, just look.

11:00.809 --> 11:02.639
Can you give me
an answer on this?

11:02.676 --> 11:04.645
You want an answer?
I'll give you an answer.

11:04.679 --> 11:06.408
How come you're the cheapest
lawyer I could find...

11:06.447 --> 11:08.710
and you still cost me
all this dough?

11:08.747 --> 11:11.078
Irving, he always wants
a little money.

11:11.116 --> 11:13.742
Hey, Billy!

11:13.784 --> 11:16.548
Did you see that?
He just met Dutch Schultz.

11:16.588 --> 11:17.815
What you got there?

11:17.854 --> 11:19.547
Now he's a big-shot.

11:19.590 --> 11:21.784
How you doing? What's going on?

11:21.825 --> 11:22.983
Let me look at it.

11:23.025 --> 11:25.513
Want to see me double it?

11:25.558 --> 11:27.789
No, I want to look at it.

11:27.827 --> 11:30.421
Hey, Billy!

11:30.463 --> 11:32.828
Hey, Behan!
Get your ass back here!

11:32.865 --> 11:34.855
Come on!
Share the wealth, Billy!

11:38.036 --> 11:39.229
Hey!

12:01.987 --> 12:03.247
Hey!

12:15.995 --> 12:19.629
Arnold!

12:22.634 --> 12:25.396
Arnold Bobbich!

12:25.434 --> 12:28.028
Arnold!

12:31.673 --> 12:33.765
- You still got it?
- Yeah.

12:33.807 --> 12:35.775
Well, go get it.

12:43.681 --> 12:46.309
Does it work?

12:46.350 --> 12:48.011
Sure. I mean, I think it does.

12:48.051 --> 12:50.017
You gotta clean it up first.

12:50.053 --> 12:51.953
- Is there bullets in it?
- No.

12:51.987 --> 12:54.477
See how the serial number's
been filed off there?

12:54.522 --> 12:57.456
That's the sign
that it's a mob gun for sure.

12:57.556 --> 12:59.023
I'll give you $3.00.

12:59.058 --> 13:00.889
You have $3.00?

13:05.162 --> 13:06.891
Where did this come from?

13:06.930 --> 13:09.990
Dutch Schultz.
Now give me my change.

13:11.934 --> 13:14.096
You lying son of a bitch.

13:21.941 --> 13:25.103
Ma, I'm going out now.
I'll be back in a while.

14:05.439 --> 14:07.769
The government's after him,
the cops are after him.

14:07.806 --> 14:10.241
Everybody's after him,
and there he is.

14:10.275 --> 14:12.106
Like he ain't got a care
in the world.

14:12.143 --> 14:14.302
He noticed you. So what?

14:14.345 --> 14:15.573
So what?

14:15.613 --> 14:18.409
You think a guy like me
has got a lot of choices?

14:18.447 --> 14:20.815
You notice John D. Rockefeller
offering me a job...

14:20.850 --> 14:23.113
or the Yankees asking me
to play shortstop?

14:23.150 --> 14:25.709
No. This is it.

14:25.753 --> 14:28.448
Becky, listen to me.

14:30.388 --> 14:33.381
You don't understand about
a guy like Dutch Schultz.

14:33.426 --> 14:35.255
He grew up around here.

14:35.292 --> 14:38.023
He was a nobody, just like me.

14:38.061 --> 14:42.019
But he had brains and guts,
and look at him now.

14:42.063 --> 14:44.259
I bet he's the richest man
in New York.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.664
I mean,
he's got the racetracks...

14:46.700 --> 14:49.066
he's got the nightclubs.

14:49.102 --> 14:50.899
He controls
the whole liquor business...

14:50.938 --> 14:53.269
he's gotten
into the numbers racket.

14:56.373 --> 14:59.001
Dutch Schultz
is the number one...

14:59.043 --> 15:01.977
and he noticed me.

15:02.011 --> 15:03.477
I'm telling you, Becky...

15:03.512 --> 15:05.640
I know whatever happens
to me in my life...

15:05.683 --> 15:09.445
it's gonna have something
to do with Mr. Schultz.

15:09.483 --> 15:11.815
What are you gonna do?

15:11.852 --> 15:14.614
I'm gonna find him.

15:14.652 --> 15:18.088
How are you gonna find him?

15:18.123 --> 15:20.283
Don't worry, I'll find him.

15:49.879 --> 15:51.674
Hey, Harry, how you doing?

15:51.714 --> 15:54.045
Great. Right on schedule.

17:29.515 --> 17:34.451
What's going on here?
Is this a joke?

17:34.486 --> 17:35.576
Lulu.

17:39.155 --> 17:40.678
All you have to do
is what you're supposed to do.

17:40.723 --> 17:41.883
Stop dicking me around!

17:41.924 --> 17:44.449
All you have to do
is make the deal.

17:44.494 --> 17:47.052
United States of America
wants me to pay taxes. Fine!

17:47.093 --> 17:48.390
I'll pay the fucking taxes!

17:48.429 --> 17:50.293
It's not as simple as that,
Arthur.

17:50.329 --> 17:52.820
Stop with the papers
and listen to me a minute!

17:52.865 --> 17:55.765
Look around you.
What do you see in this place?

17:55.800 --> 17:57.563
I got 20 desks here, right?

17:57.601 --> 18:01.128
How many men you see sitting
at these desks? Ten!

18:01.171 --> 18:03.401
Doesn't an empty desk
mean anything to you?

18:03.440 --> 18:05.431
Don't you understand
every week this goes on...

18:05.475 --> 18:07.100
that I lose money,
I lose my banks...

18:07.141 --> 18:09.768
I lose my men to
those dago scumbags downtown?

18:09.809 --> 18:11.436
Arthur,
you don't seem to understand.

18:11.477 --> 18:13.273
You don't hold all the cards
in this situation.

18:13.312 --> 18:15.802
What do you mean
I don't hold all the cards?

18:15.847 --> 18:17.575
I'm paying you
an arm and a leg, aren't I?

18:17.617 --> 18:20.845
I'm paying off half the judges
and cops in this town.

18:20.885 --> 18:23.046
What do you mean,
I don't hold the cards?

18:23.086 --> 18:24.384
These are my favorite.

18:24.421 --> 18:25.943
Arthur, this is
the federal government.

18:25.988 --> 18:28.786
Al Capone is serving
41 years for tax evasion.

18:28.823 --> 18:31.450
We'll beat it,
but it'll take a lot of money...

18:31.491 --> 18:35.086
and a lot of time,
you understand what I'm saying?

18:37.062 --> 18:38.460
Who are you?

18:40.498 --> 18:42.931
A kid with luck.

18:42.966 --> 18:44.194
Yeah?

18:44.234 --> 18:46.428
Well, we could use some.

18:46.469 --> 18:48.232
We haven't heard from George.

18:48.271 --> 18:49.794
Yeah, he's always
straight with me.

18:49.839 --> 18:51.203
Irving, come in here
and close the door.

18:51.239 --> 18:52.330
I want to talk to you.

19:01.846 --> 19:03.780
You forgot the coffee.

19:08.051 --> 19:10.848
- That's it for today.
- OK, Otto.

19:10.885 --> 19:13.548
- Wipe the board clean.
- Right.

19:13.589 --> 19:16.055
- You play the numbers, kid?
- No, sir.

19:16.088 --> 19:20.616
- Good. You got a mother?
- Yes, sir.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.992
Don't let her
play the numbers, either.

19:24.028 --> 19:26.156
But I'll tell you what,
I'll put you onto a sure thing.

19:26.197 --> 19:27.321
A horse?

19:27.364 --> 19:29.332
The world is numbers,
not horses.

19:29.366 --> 19:31.333
For instance, I'll tell you
how much money...

19:31.367 --> 19:34.893
you got in your pocket.
If I'm right, I win it.

19:34.937 --> 19:37.234
If I'm wrong,
I'm gonna match it...

19:37.272 --> 19:38.964
and you'll have double
what you had before.

19:39.005 --> 19:40.301
- How's that?
- All right.

19:40.340 --> 19:42.000
Count your money.
Don't let me see it.

19:42.041 --> 19:44.305
- I know how much it is.
- Good.

19:44.342 --> 19:47.311
Now double that in your head,
and add three.

19:47.345 --> 19:48.936
All right.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.972
- Now product that by five.
- Product?

19:52.015 --> 19:55.142
Multiply that by five,
subtract six...

19:55.184 --> 19:56.912
and tell me
what you come up with.

19:59.254 --> 20:00.810
279.

20:00.853 --> 20:04.311
- You just lost 27 cents.
- Yeah!

20:10.963 --> 20:13.088
You might consider
the study of numbers.

20:13.129 --> 20:17.360
Question: What's 125th and 3rd?

20:17.399 --> 20:20.130
A street corner.
There's a candy store.

20:20.169 --> 20:21.931
It's one of our numbers houses.

20:29.441 --> 20:31.136
Son of a bitch.

20:36.713 --> 20:38.839
Let's get out of here.

20:46.753 --> 20:48.311
Otto sent me.

20:48.355 --> 20:52.015
Ain't nothing I can do.
I work for them now.

20:52.056 --> 20:54.457
You tell him that, hear?

20:54.492 --> 20:58.119
You see what happens
when I try to do right?

20:58.160 --> 21:00.856
You can all go to hell,
as far as I'm concerned.

21:00.897 --> 21:05.298
All white men together.
You tell him that, too.

21:07.634 --> 21:09.125
Sounds like Jack Kelly.

21:09.169 --> 21:12.660
See, kid?
I don't start these things.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.500
I'm just
this good-natured slob...

21:14.538 --> 21:18.030
that people think
they can walk right over.

21:18.074 --> 21:19.905
- You in a gang?
- No, sir.

21:19.943 --> 21:22.775
No? How do you expect
to learn anything?

21:22.811 --> 21:26.610
I hire from gangs.
That's the training ground.

21:26.649 --> 21:28.616
Did you ever hear
of the Frog Hollow gang?

21:28.650 --> 21:29.980
No, sir.

21:30.016 --> 21:32.417
That was the most famous
of all the Bronx gangs.

21:32.451 --> 21:34.078
That's where the original
Dutch Schultz came from.

21:34.120 --> 21:36.144
He was the toughest street
fighter that ever lived...

21:36.187 --> 21:38.485
so they named me Dutch Schultz
in my neighborhood.

21:38.522 --> 21:39.820
It was like an honorary thing.

21:39.857 --> 21:42.825
Most of the gangs now
are just dumb kids.

21:42.860 --> 21:43.885
Is that right?

21:43.927 --> 21:45.553
I think,
for the real training...

21:45.596 --> 21:46.754
Yeah?

21:46.794 --> 21:48.762
You gotta go right to the top.

21:48.796 --> 21:50.889
You're supposed
to see Bo Weinberg.

21:50.932 --> 21:52.329
Hey, Otto, you ought
to listen to this kid.

21:52.364 --> 21:53.627
You'll learn something.

21:53.667 --> 21:56.329
Thanks.

22:00.773 --> 22:02.297
What?

22:02.340 --> 22:04.329
Jack Kelly's gonna be
at the Beakman barber shop...

22:04.374 --> 22:05.772
tomorrow morning at 9:00.

22:05.808 --> 22:07.208
Good.

22:07.243 --> 22:09.336
We'll let Bo handle this.
You give him a ring.

22:09.377 --> 22:12.505
I tried to get Bo for two days.
I can't find him anywhere.

22:12.548 --> 22:13.571
Where the hell is he?

22:13.615 --> 22:15.343
He's supposed
to be minding the store.

22:15.381 --> 22:16.644
All right, kid,
I want you to be...

22:16.683 --> 22:19.583
at Broadway and Nassau
at 9:00 in the morning.

22:19.618 --> 22:20.778
What do I do?

22:20.820 --> 22:24.186
What you do is,
you don't ask any questions.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.072
Extra, extra!
Get your "Daily Mirror!"

23:02.115 --> 23:06.139
- Kid.
- Mr. Berman.

23:06.183 --> 23:09.153
- Is that the car?
- Yes, sir.

23:11.521 --> 23:15.183
Extra! Extra!
Get your "Daily Mirror"!

23:17.559 --> 23:19.186
- You sure that's him?
- Yes, sir.

23:19.227 --> 23:20.819
I'm gonna have
a talk with Mr. Kelly.

23:20.861 --> 23:22.623
Not yet. Wait'll Bo gets here.

23:22.663 --> 23:23.822
Bo? I don't need Bo for this.

23:23.863 --> 23:27.161
- Not now.
- I'm just gonna talk to him.

23:38.273 --> 23:46.273
Gangland murder!
Barbershop slaying!

23:56.887 --> 23:59.014
"Grisly. " There was
nothing grisly about it.

23:59.056 --> 24:00.715
It was a professional
piece of work.

24:00.757 --> 24:02.588
Look at this. It was neat,
clean, end of story...

24:02.624 --> 24:03.749
good-bye and good luck.

24:03.792 --> 24:05.759
They'll think
one of the guineas...

24:05.794 --> 24:07.760
or the coloreds
slit his throat.

24:07.795 --> 24:10.023
So, how do I know it was
the Dutchman right off the bat?

24:11.529 --> 24:14.123
Aw, it's good to see you, Bo.

24:14.165 --> 24:15.793
We thought you was dead.

24:15.833 --> 24:17.528
Well, obviously I ain't.

24:17.567 --> 24:20.228
You couldn't wait 24 hours?

24:20.270 --> 24:22.101
You couldn't wait
24 hours for me...

24:22.139 --> 24:23.696
to come home and do this
the right way?

24:23.740 --> 24:25.262
Believe me, it was done right.

24:25.307 --> 24:26.934
Where were you?
I called around...

24:26.975 --> 24:28.067
nobody knows where you are.

24:28.108 --> 24:29.202
He was with some broad.

24:29.244 --> 24:32.075
This was no broad.
This was a lady, a real lady.

24:32.110 --> 24:33.578
Where'd you take
this real lady...

24:33.613 --> 24:35.169
that's more important
than business?

24:35.212 --> 24:36.509
Wherever it was,
she wasn't complaining.

24:36.548 --> 24:38.105
You could've called,
checked in.

24:38.149 --> 24:40.673
We never know where you are,
what you're doing.

24:40.718 --> 24:43.585
You're always with some dame.
We're running a business here.

24:43.621 --> 24:47.076
Arthur's going on trial.
You're supposed to be in charge.

24:52.459 --> 24:56.120
You got complaints
about the way I run things?

24:56.161 --> 24:58.925
All Otto's saying is if
you're gonna shack up, fine...

24:58.963 --> 25:01.226
but we didn't know
where you was.

25:01.265 --> 25:03.665
What he's trying to say is,
the way you handled it...

25:03.700 --> 25:06.134
just wasn't too fucking smart,
that's all.

25:06.500 --> 25:07.300
That's all.

25:07.500 --> 25:09.193
Look at it this way, Arthur...

25:09.234 --> 25:11.466
you're the one on the lam,
and I'm the one on the town.

25:11.505 --> 25:13.664
Who would you rather be
at this moment?

25:13.705 --> 25:14.967
You know what I mean?

25:40.232 --> 25:42.635
Is that a great tune?

25:43.871 --> 25:48.139
Hey, kid,
take this to Mr. Schultz.

25:53.015 --> 25:56.505
That's right, watch your toes.

26:06.127 --> 26:08.857
I could do that easily.
Come here.

26:13.536 --> 26:15.196
Yeah, that's right.

26:28.418 --> 26:30.853
What?

26:32.457 --> 26:34.754
Bo Weinberg's
double-crossing us.

26:34.791 --> 26:37.729
He met with
one of the other gangs.

26:37.766 --> 26:40.731
He offered to cut them in
on our whole operation.

26:40.765 --> 26:43.564
That's a lot of shit.
I can't believe that.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.933
The meeting took place
on the tenth.

26:45.971 --> 26:48.962
Saratoga.
The Piping Rock Casino.

26:49.006 --> 26:50.941
The barbershop
was on the tenth...

26:50.977 --> 26:52.500
why we couldn't reach him.

26:52.543 --> 26:55.241
He said he was shacked up.

26:55.282 --> 26:59.513
He didn't say who with,
or where.

27:05.162 --> 27:07.819
No, no, no,
it doesn't make sense, Otto.

27:10.097 --> 27:12.565
Why would he do something
like that?

27:12.599 --> 27:15.034
Arthur, nobody thinks
you're gonna beat this rap.

27:15.067 --> 27:18.471
Word on the street
is that you're as good as dead.

27:18.505 --> 27:19.907
Maybe Bo's just looking
to the future.

27:19.942 --> 27:22.878
What are you talking about?
You know how far back we go.

27:22.912 --> 27:25.743
Come on, I can't bel-
What do you want?

27:25.779 --> 27:29.579
Yes, sir. The bartender
asked me to give you this.

27:39.294 --> 27:40.957
Thank you.

28:04.722 --> 28:06.715
Good night, Mr. Weinberg.

28:13.332 --> 28:16.594
- I'm going to the bathroom.
- OK.

28:36.224 --> 28:38.784
Kid.

28:38.826 --> 28:40.554
Kid.

28:40.597 --> 28:41.925
Mr. Weinberg.

28:41.962 --> 28:43.589
Dutchman's
got you working late?

28:43.631 --> 28:45.119
Yes, sir.

28:47.568 --> 28:49.229
Where are you from, kid?

28:49.271 --> 28:52.068
The Bronx. Bathgate Avenue.

28:52.106 --> 28:53.733
Jerome Avenue.

29:01.113 --> 29:03.607
Say hello to a friend of mine
from the Bronx.

29:03.651 --> 29:05.312
Hello.

29:08.125 --> 29:10.318
Mr. Weinberg, this is $20.

29:10.359 --> 29:12.724
Yeah, get some sleep, kid.

29:12.760 --> 29:15.096
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

29:21.472 --> 29:24.441
You know what a loyal man
is worth these days, kid?

29:24.476 --> 29:27.339
His weight in gold.
You remember that.

29:27.377 --> 29:29.902
He lied to me, Otto.

29:29.947 --> 29:31.311
He lied to me.

29:31.348 --> 29:35.111
I will take him down,
and that is a sacred vow.

29:35.151 --> 29:37.051
You have to be careful.
Bo has many friends.

29:37.085 --> 29:40.055
He was the best... smart.

29:40.089 --> 29:42.583
I never had to tell Bo
to do anything twice.

29:42.627 --> 29:45.116
I would say it one time,
and bang, it was done...

29:45.160 --> 29:46.628
and it was done right.

29:46.662 --> 29:47.893
Hey, anybody in there?

29:47.932 --> 29:50.422
I promise you, kid,
it was done right.

29:50.468 --> 29:52.266
You get high marks for this.

29:52.305 --> 29:54.102
The fire inspector.
Must be payday.

29:54.140 --> 29:55.800
I'll talk to him.

29:55.840 --> 29:57.205
Come on, open up!

29:57.242 --> 29:59.802
He had balls.
Nobody had balls like Bo.

29:59.844 --> 30:00.813
Let me talk to the manager.

30:00.847 --> 30:02.106
He's not here. Come back later.

30:02.146 --> 30:05.676
I remember one time,
the guineas wanted him...

30:05.718 --> 30:09.247
to take out one of their guys,
and you know what he done?

30:09.288 --> 30:11.257
He put on a cop's uniform.

30:11.289 --> 30:12.347
Where's the manager?

30:12.390 --> 30:14.120
Hey, where you going?
You can't come in here.

30:14.159 --> 30:15.423
This is a private meeting.

30:15.460 --> 30:17.759
What's the matter, pal?
You got a problem?

30:23.670 --> 30:25.640
You want a payoff?!

30:29.043 --> 30:32.012
I'll give you a payoff!

30:50.599 --> 30:54.034
Get this load of shit
out of here.

30:54.068 --> 30:56.332
Fucking fire inspector.

30:57.972 --> 31:00.771
What's next, the mailman?

31:08.086 --> 31:10.781
I can't take it, Otto.

31:10.824 --> 31:13.343
I can't take it
when it's all over the street.

31:13.390 --> 31:14.916
I'm going to have to get
Hines to deal with this.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.929
- It'll cost.
- Do what you have to do.

31:17.963 --> 31:19.188
If I have to go to trial...

31:19.229 --> 31:21.356
I'm not going to trial
in the city.

31:21.399 --> 31:23.833
I want it in the boondocks.

31:23.868 --> 31:26.564
Oh, Bo...

31:26.604 --> 31:29.163
what have you done to me?

31:29.206 --> 31:31.299
Close the door.

31:32.877 --> 31:34.607
Mr. Berman.

31:34.647 --> 31:37.276
What are we going to do?
He killed that man.

31:37.315 --> 31:39.111
Forget it.
You didn't see anything.

31:39.150 --> 31:40.482
You didn't hear anything.
Nothing happened.

31:40.520 --> 31:44.651
You even think about it again,
you're as good as dead.

31:44.690 --> 31:48.680
Listen to me, kid.
You're the upcoming generation.

31:48.727 --> 31:50.491
Things are going
to be different for you.

31:50.531 --> 31:53.557
You need different skills
from these guys.

31:53.600 --> 31:56.200
It'll be streamlined-
not so much fire in the street.

31:56.300 --> 31:57.770
And when that happens,
if you're lucky...

31:57.804 --> 32:00.204
you may not have to kill anyone.

32:00.240 --> 32:04.511
And what that means is,
no one will have to kill you.

32:04.548 --> 32:07.145
Let's go. Get the lights.

32:14.133 --> 32:17.504
Here's your salary-$12.

32:17.543 --> 32:21.312
Now, this $50 is my money.

32:23.019 --> 32:24.885
I want you to buy
a new pair of pants...

32:24.921 --> 32:27.223
a nice jacket,
shirt with a tie...

32:27.258 --> 32:28.988
pair of shoes with laces.

32:29.028 --> 32:30.965
It's a personal
embarrassment to me...

32:30.997 --> 32:32.467
to see the way you dress.

32:32.502 --> 32:35.805
And I want you to get a valise
to put the clothes in.

32:35.844 --> 32:37.473
And buy something nice
for your mother.

32:37.514 --> 32:38.709
Where am I going?

32:38.750 --> 32:41.414
Mr. Schultz is having
a trial coming up...

32:41.453 --> 32:44.684
and we have decided
he'll get a better deal...

32:44.726 --> 32:46.559
if the trial
takes place upstate.

32:46.597 --> 32:47.961
Is that all right with you?

32:49.434 --> 32:51.166
And I want you
to buy a book to read.

32:51.204 --> 32:52.766
What do I need a book for?

32:52.809 --> 32:55.211
You gonna do what I say
or give me a hard time?

32:57.016 --> 32:58.315
- Mr. Berman?
- Yes?

32:58.353 --> 33:00.324
Who is this man you're meeting?

33:00.358 --> 33:03.796
If you want to stay
in the crime business, kid...

33:03.829 --> 33:06.856
you got to stop asking
all these questions.

33:12.914 --> 33:15.977
His name is Hines.

33:16.018 --> 33:19.014
He's a district leader
for Tammany Hall.

33:19.059 --> 33:20.688
He's on our payroll...

33:20.729 --> 33:24.030
takes care of problems
like this.

33:31.448 --> 33:33.317
So, Otto, you're looking good.

33:33.353 --> 33:36.484
Good to see you.
It's a pleasure.

33:46.413 --> 33:49.611
These guys ain't like
anybody you ever met.

33:49.650 --> 33:52.177
They want something-
boom-it gets done.

33:52.220 --> 33:53.485
And the money-I swear...

33:53.524 --> 33:55.257
you never seen money
like this in your life.

33:55.297 --> 33:57.289
So what?
How much money can you spend?

33:57.332 --> 33:58.890
That ain't the point.

33:58.935 --> 34:01.302
Let me tell you,
money can do anything.

34:01.339 --> 34:03.274
I bet you never had
anything in your life...

34:03.309 --> 34:05.909
that somebody else
didn't wear first.

34:12.527 --> 34:15.965
Here.
Get yourself something nice.

34:17.337 --> 34:19.806
Come on, Arnold,
we're having a party.

34:19.842 --> 34:22.005
- Where?
- Where do you think?

34:22.045 --> 34:23.540
Just don't break
anything this time.

34:23.585 --> 34:24.676
Don't worry.

34:29.161 --> 34:30.789
Hello.

34:33.300 --> 34:35.533
Mr. Klein, how are you?

34:35.572 --> 34:37.370
Look at you, wearing a suit.

34:37.409 --> 34:39.471
Mr. Rosen, you're looking good.

34:39.514 --> 34:41.507
- How are you?
- Very good.

34:42.886 --> 34:45.016
Girls, girls, girls.

34:50.067 --> 34:52.039
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hello, Billy.

34:52.072 --> 34:54.167
- Hey, Mrs. Thomas.
- Hello, Billy.

34:54.210 --> 34:57.147
- Billy, don't you look swell?
- Thank you.

34:57.181 --> 34:58.480
Hi, Ma.

34:59.718 --> 35:01.517
I got a job.

35:01.555 --> 35:05.962
The thing is,
it's in the country-upstate.

35:05.999 --> 35:08.434
It's just for the summer.

35:08.468 --> 35:10.769
Ma?

35:14.214 --> 35:16.480
This is for you.

35:16.518 --> 35:20.480
Billy Behan, look at you...

35:20.524 --> 35:23.966
the richest man
on Bathgate Avenue.

36:59.484 --> 37:00.510
You're bad.

37:01.788 --> 37:03.551
Let's go to work.

37:11.773 --> 37:15.506
- Irving.
- Miss, this way.

37:15.545 --> 37:18.779
What? What's the matter?

37:18.820 --> 37:20.913
- Come on.
- Bo, what's going on?

37:38.724 --> 37:42.062
- Good evening, Bo.
- Leave her out of this, Dutch.

37:42.098 --> 37:45.001
This must be love.

37:45.036 --> 37:47.599
Tch. What is your name, miss?

37:47.641 --> 37:49.339
Her name is Lola.

37:49.378 --> 37:53.445
That can't be.
I know all the girls named Lola.

37:54.724 --> 37:57.455
You must be Arthur.

38:15.929 --> 38:19.028
Kid, go see what he's doing.

38:19.070 --> 38:21.698
He don't have no respect.
Go see if she's all right.

38:23.911 --> 38:26.976
Do what I told you.
Go see if she's all right.

38:36.703 --> 38:39.639
You know what
I'm talking about, don't you?

38:39.675 --> 38:43.776
You don't care about
what's dead, do you?

38:43.818 --> 38:45.480
Because
I'm telling you right now...

38:45.518 --> 38:48.387
except for a few details,
he's dead.

38:48.424 --> 38:50.689
Can you understand that?

38:52.500 --> 38:55.529
You can forget about the dead,
can't you?

38:57.543 --> 39:00.983
I think you've forgotten
already, haven't you?

39:03.922 --> 39:05.980
Well?

39:08.531 --> 39:10.501
I'm waiting.

39:14.043 --> 39:17.013
It's either a yes or a no.

39:19.186 --> 39:22.853
- I-I...
- What?

39:22.895 --> 39:26.023
I'm sorry. I can't hear you.

39:27.936 --> 39:29.334
What?

39:32.308 --> 39:33.607
Yes.

39:33.644 --> 39:37.451
Aw... that's too bad.

39:37.487 --> 39:40.051
That's too bad for Bo.

39:41.628 --> 39:44.861
Because if
I thought you loved him...

39:44.900 --> 39:47.564
I might've changed my mind.

40:32.100 --> 40:33.377
OK, kid.

40:34.954 --> 40:37.652
Take the lady to her apartment.

40:37.693 --> 40:39.824
Don't let her
make any phone calls...

40:39.867 --> 40:42.168
although I don't think
she'll try.

40:42.207 --> 40:44.108
She'll pack some things.

40:44.145 --> 40:46.115
Stay with her until I come back.

40:46.150 --> 40:47.916
Somebody will call you up
on the house phone...

40:47.955 --> 40:50.928
to bring her down. You got it?

41:34.741 --> 41:37.975
Have you ever seen
such a terrible night?

41:39.422 --> 41:41.793
Good evening, Mrs. Preston.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.508
Drew?

41:50.384 --> 41:51.783
Drew?

41:51.820 --> 41:54.657
I have to pee, Harvey.

41:54.693 --> 41:58.261
I thought you were out
for the evening.

41:58.302 --> 42:00.834
You all right? Drew.

42:08.529 --> 42:10.227
Now tell me
what you've gone and done.

42:10.267 --> 42:11.668
You didn't ditch him.

42:11.704 --> 42:14.440
I thought you were
so wild about him.

42:14.478 --> 42:16.244
Harvey, I don't
want to talk about it.

42:16.282 --> 42:17.980
It's perfectly
all right with me.

42:18.018 --> 42:19.993
I never could stand him anyway.

42:20.026 --> 42:22.291
Listen, I'll be
going away for a while.

42:22.330 --> 42:23.733
You can't mean it.

42:23.768 --> 42:26.469
Going away?
Where? For how long?

42:26.509 --> 42:28.983
We're supposed to be going to
the Willett's this weekend.

42:29.017 --> 42:31.852
To say nothing of dinner
tomorrow evening with Dwight.

42:31.890 --> 42:33.382
Which was your idea
to begin with...

42:33.427 --> 42:34.894
if I'm not mistaken.

42:34.931 --> 42:36.833
Darling, you'll just
have to make excuses for me.

42:36.869 --> 42:39.136
There's certain
proprieties to be maintained.

42:39.175 --> 42:41.670
You are my wife...
or have you forgotten?

42:41.715 --> 42:44.483
Harvey, what's the point
of making a fuss?

42:44.522 --> 42:45.821
There's a certain limit.

42:45.859 --> 42:47.490
A bit of scandal
isn't the point...

42:47.531 --> 42:48.861
but sooner or later,
you'll get in over your head...

42:48.899 --> 42:50.425
and then what will you do?

42:50.469 --> 42:53.274
Expect you to come
to the rescue like always.

42:54.412 --> 42:58.256
Get me another drink,
would you, please?

42:59.562 --> 43:02.263
If that's my gangster,
tell him to wait.

43:11.628 --> 43:14.895
Mrs. Preston,
you got a first name?

43:14.935 --> 43:16.428
Drew.

43:16.474 --> 43:22.513
Drew? You're the first Drew
I ever met.

43:22.555 --> 43:25.118
You're the first Dutch.

43:32.413 --> 43:35.180
All right, we have
28 days before the trial.

43:35.219 --> 43:37.590
That means 28 days
to show these folks...

43:37.626 --> 43:39.928
that Dutch Schultz
is one of them.

43:39.967 --> 43:42.165
Starting off,
we call him by his real name...

43:42.205 --> 43:43.872
Mr. Flegenheimer.

43:43.910 --> 43:46.474
Everything is quiet and polite.

43:46.518 --> 43:48.419
We're plain folks,
just like them...

43:48.455 --> 43:50.218
who got the government
on their backs.

43:50.259 --> 43:52.995
They understand that.
We don't get into fights.

43:53.034 --> 43:55.506
No feeling up the chambermaids.

43:55.541 --> 43:57.341
From now on,
you eat with your mouth closed.

43:57.379 --> 44:00.045
- This is horse shit.
- No foul language.

44:00.086 --> 44:03.117
No booze, no dames, no fighting.

44:03.162 --> 44:06.032
This is different from the city.
These are decent people.

44:06.069 --> 44:08.541
Make sure you act decent.

44:08.573 --> 44:10.167
Where's the book?

44:10.210 --> 44:11.474
I told you to bring a book.

44:11.515 --> 44:13.109
Either you listen,
or you go back to the Bronx.

44:13.152 --> 44:14.519
It's not some kind of picnic.

44:14.555 --> 44:17.187
Take this to Mrs. Preston.

44:25.649 --> 44:27.451
Is that coffee?

44:27.490 --> 44:29.895
Yes.

44:31.032 --> 44:34.233
Thank you.

44:44.636 --> 44:48.202
I once met Alvin Pincus,
who ran with Pretty Boy Floyd.

44:48.245 --> 44:51.514
- He always said banks was best.
- Look where he is now.

44:51.553 --> 44:53.582
Going for the dough
in the one place...

44:53.625 --> 44:55.388
that's under lock and key,
you gotta be stupid.

44:55.426 --> 44:58.731
- Yeah, but-
- Stay with the car, Lulu.

45:00.543 --> 45:01.738
You got anything to tell me
about the girl?

45:01.776 --> 45:03.079
Her name is Drew Preston.

45:03.114 --> 45:04.606
You want to explain
what she's doing here?

45:04.650 --> 45:05.642
We got a trial coming up.

45:05.688 --> 45:07.086
She's the kid's governess.

45:07.123 --> 45:08.427
The properties
are being observed.

45:08.464 --> 45:10.124
- The what?
- The properties.

45:10.166 --> 45:12.035
Wait a minute.

45:12.073 --> 45:15.741
There. You look handsome.

45:15.782 --> 45:19.152
That's a compliment.

45:19.192 --> 45:20.716
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

45:20.762 --> 45:22.391
It's very nice
to make your acquaintance.

45:22.431 --> 45:26.604
May I introduce
my business manager, Mr. Berman?

45:26.645 --> 45:29.911
And Mrs. Preston, who is
the governess of my prodigy.

45:29.950 --> 45:31.786
It is a pleasure to meet you.

45:41.681 --> 45:44.213
I'd like to open
a checking account for $10,000.

45:44.255 --> 45:45.657
And the rest
in a savings account.

45:45.693 --> 45:47.391
Of course.

45:47.432 --> 45:49.996
Excuse me a moment.

45:50.038 --> 45:53.375
I'll get my head accountant
to take care of the paperwork.

45:56.386 --> 45:59.988
Honey, you are looking at the
patron saint of the boondocks.

46:00.028 --> 46:01.557
Arthur, if I make
a tiny criticism...

46:01.600 --> 46:03.250
do you promise not
to get all sulky and pout?

46:03.300 --> 46:05.271
- What?
- It's protege.

46:05.305 --> 46:09.141
- What did I say?
- Prodigy.

46:09.176 --> 46:11.611
It means "Child genius."

46:11.646 --> 46:13.174
Thank you very much,
Mr. Flegenheimer.

46:13.218 --> 46:15.412
We don't often get famous people
in our little town.

46:15.453 --> 46:16.422
Yeah, I know what you mean.

46:16.458 --> 46:17.650
Look, if it's
all right with you...

46:17.690 --> 46:19.662
Mr. Berman will stay here
and work out the details.

46:19.696 --> 46:20.995
I'm sure
there'll be no problem.

46:21.031 --> 46:22.897
Say, young fella,
what's the younger generation...

46:22.934 --> 46:24.299
reading these days?

46:24.337 --> 46:26.432
Yes.

46:26.474 --> 46:28.446
What's your name, son?

46:28.478 --> 46:31.246
Billy...

46:31.286 --> 46:33.482
Bathgate.

46:33.523 --> 46:34.885
With youngsters like this,
we don't have to worry...

46:34.922 --> 46:37.222
about the future
of this country, do we?

46:37.259 --> 46:39.493
No, we don't.

46:39.531 --> 46:41.589
I hope to see you soon.

46:41.634 --> 46:42.897
Yeah, right. Come here.

46:42.939 --> 46:43.907
Let me see that, will you?

46:43.938 --> 46:45.409
What do you got there?

46:45.445 --> 46:47.638
What is this?
Was this your idea?

46:47.679 --> 46:49.013
Don't look at me, boss.

46:49.050 --> 46:50.744
You? This was your brainstorm?

46:50.785 --> 46:51.846
Yeah.

46:51.888 --> 46:53.514
I love it. What'd I tell you?

46:53.555 --> 46:55.525
The kid's all right.
He's my prodigy.

46:55.561 --> 46:57.723
I know how to pick my words.
You're my prodigy.

46:57.765 --> 46:59.999
Get in the car.
We ain't got all day.

47:00.034 --> 47:01.833
Mickey, I got an inspiration.

47:01.872 --> 47:04.171
- Inspiration, right?
- Inspiration.

47:15.761 --> 47:17.736
What kind of church is this?

47:17.769 --> 47:20.638
It's Catholic.

47:20.674 --> 47:23.667
They put a lot of work
into this place.

47:23.711 --> 47:26.009
"G," 58.

47:28.454 --> 47:30.754
"I," 17.

47:32.594 --> 47:35.088
- "G," 51.
- Bingo!

47:35.132 --> 47:36.760
And especially Mr. Schultz...

47:36.801 --> 47:42.073
for so generously donating
a special cash prize of $25.

47:43.813 --> 47:45.909
Dollar, a dollar five,
who'll go a dollar five?

47:45.951 --> 47:47.821
Put the ring in there.
It's not frozen.

47:47.857 --> 47:50.124
- 5 dollar, 10 dollar, 15.
- All righty.

47:50.159 --> 47:51.389
Ten chickens here
in the two crates.

47:51.430 --> 47:54.296
Bid 25 cents anyone?
25, now 30, now 5.

47:54.333 --> 47:55.856
I'll give you $100
for the chickens...

47:55.900 --> 47:57.840
and how much
you want for the farm?

48:20.600 --> 48:22.100
I try to talk to him,
but it's impossible.

48:22.200 --> 48:22.950
Sometimes he listens...

48:23.000 --> 48:24.700
and sometimes
he won't listen at all.

48:25.200 --> 48:27.200
Looks like he's going
for the farm vote.

48:29.074 --> 48:30.800
I hope this helps for now.

48:30.900 --> 48:32.200
If you need more later,
I can't promise...

48:32.250 --> 48:35.100
but I'll do what I can,
Mister...

48:35.300 --> 48:36.150
Chambers.

48:36.200 --> 48:38.300
- Chambers.
- Thank you, sir.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.900
God bless you
for what you're doing, sir.

48:40.900 --> 48:42.800
Mickey... who's next?

48:43.190 --> 48:44.690
Yeah, well, Dixie's here.

48:44.768 --> 48:47.200
- What are you doing here?
- Hello, Arthur.

48:48.100 --> 48:49.500
Come here.
Give me some more coffee.

48:50.100 --> 48:52.700
Why aren't you in the city?
What are you coming up here for?

48:53.600 --> 48:54.800
Arthur, we need to talk.

48:54.900 --> 48:56.100
Why didn't you call me up?

48:56.800 --> 48:59.000
I didn't want to say this
on the telephone.

48:59.100 --> 49:00.100
Say what?

49:00.300 --> 49:01.800
The government turned down
our offer.

49:01.850 --> 49:04.000
- So double it.
- No. They won't settle.

49:04.050 --> 49:06.250
The prosecutor's
determined to go to trial.

49:06.300 --> 49:08.600
Aw, shit.
So we'll take care of him, too.

49:08.800 --> 49:10.300
No. It's no soap.
He can't be bought.

49:10.350 --> 49:12.800
He said that? What do you want?

49:12.900 --> 49:13.900
I got your coffee.

49:15.200 --> 49:19.200
Put in on the table.
Why are you always listening?

49:19.600 --> 49:22.400
Will you go upstairs and tell Mrs. Preston
to take you to a museum or something?

49:22.700 --> 49:26.100
Get out of here! Go to the zoo.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.600
Do something useful.
I need the suite.

49:39.200 --> 49:40.400
Mrs. Preston?

49:47.000 --> 49:48.500
Mr. Schultz
said I should wake you.

49:51.300 --> 49:52.700
He said he needs the room...

49:53.100 --> 49:54.600
so we should go
to a museum or something.

49:59.700 --> 50:02.000
Mrs. Preston, I don't think
this was such a good idea.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.600
Mr. Schultz didn't
say anything about this.

50:06.600 --> 50:07.900
One of things
about being in a gang...

50:07.950 --> 50:09.400
is you got to follow orders.

50:10.100 --> 50:12.300
So far, everything
they asked me to do, I done it.

50:12.400 --> 50:13.200
Did it.

50:14.400 --> 50:16.700
I mean it.
I think we ought to go back.

50:33.800 --> 50:34.800
Mrs. Preston?

50:38.000 --> 50:39.000
Mrs. Preston!

50:54.200 --> 50:55.200
Mrs. Preston!

51:13.900 --> 51:17.000
Mrs. Preston, are you all right?

51:20.300 --> 51:22.000
How was it when Bo died?

51:28.700 --> 51:30.000
Could you tell me, please?

51:39.200 --> 51:40.200
You got him?

51:40.700 --> 51:42.000
Hold onto him.

51:53.200 --> 51:54.800
Take care of my girl, kid.

51:55.900 --> 51:57.400
Don't let him hurt her.

51:58.500 --> 52:00.400
Get her away from him
before he hurts her.

52:01.200 --> 52:02.000
You hear me?

52:04.300 --> 52:05.400
Promise me.

52:07.600 --> 52:12.362
- Say it!
- I promise.

52:47.100 --> 52:48.673
Mrs. Preston!

52:50.094 --> 52:53.714
Mrs. Preston!

53:22.800 --> 53:24.900
Did he really
ask you to protect me?

53:25.400 --> 53:26.400
Yes.

53:28.300 --> 53:29.300
It's strange.

53:31.200 --> 53:35.200
I mean, that he would think
that I couldn't take care of myself.

53:38.900 --> 53:40.600
And you promised him you would?

53:41.700 --> 53:42.600
Yes.

53:42.900 --> 53:44.600
You always keep your promises?

53:56.600 --> 53:58.300
Do you have a girlfriend?

54:00.128 --> 54:01.863
Yes. Yes.

54:07.100 --> 54:09.000
She's a very lucky girl.

54:30.300 --> 54:32.800
They may not be thinkers,
but they do think.

54:33.300 --> 54:34.700
What is that supposed to mean?

54:35.000 --> 54:36.100
They remember Bo.

54:36.700 --> 54:40.000
I remember, too. What he did
he brought upon himself.

54:40.600 --> 54:41.400
I am upset, too.

54:41.450 --> 54:43.500
Just because I don't
go around talking about it...

54:43.900 --> 54:45.100
They liked Bo.

54:45.900 --> 54:49.500
They don't appreciate his
lady friend's presence here.

54:49.900 --> 54:51.800
That is
their hard luck, isn't it?

54:55.100 --> 54:57.400
What do you think the odds are
I'll beat this rap?

54:57.500 --> 54:58.800
- I wouldn't bet on you.
- Why not?

54:59.100 --> 55:02.500
We come up here,
take the time, the trouble...

55:02.550 --> 55:04.300
the effort to set things right...

55:04.350 --> 55:09.800
make a good impression,
and you bring along this broad.

55:11.000 --> 55:12.400
All right, you made your point.

55:21.000 --> 55:21.800
What?

55:23.300 --> 55:25.200
She was there when Bo got it.

55:27.500 --> 55:28.600
That is correct.

55:29.100 --> 55:30.250
She never should've
got on that boat...

55:30.300 --> 55:32.300
and she never should've got off.

55:36.900 --> 55:37.900
When the time comes...

55:41.800 --> 55:43.200
I'll smack her around a little.

55:43.700 --> 55:45.800
And that's all it'll take,
I promise you.

55:46.700 --> 55:48.900
Don't fall in love with her, Arthur.

55:52.300 --> 55:54.000
Boy, you are some picnic tonight.

55:55.500 --> 55:57.700
I said, don't fall in love with her.

56:10.700 --> 56:12.300
- Who's out there?
- Nobody.

56:12.600 --> 56:15.400
Jesus Christ,
you scared the shit out of me.

56:16.600 --> 56:17.600
It's nothing.

56:21.700 --> 56:24.900
The citizens of Onondaga
are hard-working people...

56:24.950 --> 56:26.800
who usually get
the short end of the stick...

56:26.900 --> 56:29.150
but our forefathers
have dealt you...

56:29.185 --> 56:31.400
a couple of cards
in your favor...

56:31.450 --> 56:33.500
and you people know the law...

56:33.550 --> 56:36.900
isn't nothing but what
the people say it is.

56:37.700 --> 56:39.700
I have great confidence
that the people in this town...

56:39.750 --> 56:42.700
know I hold the same virtues
of right and wrong.

56:43.200 --> 56:46.100
And if I just may wax poetic
for a moment...

56:52.500 --> 56:54.800
Mrs. Preston,
you got to be careful.

56:55.300 --> 56:56.400
Otto saw us.

56:58.600 --> 56:59.800
I mean it, Mrs. Preston.

56:59.850 --> 57:02.100
You got to watch out
with these people.

57:04.100 --> 57:04.900
Why?

57:07.700 --> 57:10.667
They don't like anybody
to have something on them.

57:13.100 --> 57:14.800
Do I have something on them?

57:15.500 --> 57:16.500
Do I?

57:17.500 --> 57:18.400
You were on the boat.

57:20.500 --> 57:22.000
That makes you a danger to them.

57:25.700 --> 57:28.200
If I have something on them,
then so do you.

57:30.000 --> 57:31.000
Yeah.

57:32.800 --> 57:33.800
You're right.

57:35.200 --> 57:35.700
If I don't catch on...

57:35.750 --> 57:37.400
then I will
have something on them.

57:38.200 --> 57:40.100
If Mr. Schultz decides
against me, that's it.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.200
There's nothing anyone can do.

57:45.300 --> 57:47.900
Let me tell you something
about your Mr. Schultz.

57:48.900 --> 57:51.200
He is a very ordinary man.

57:55.400 --> 57:57.300
Now you've got something on me.

58:14.700 --> 58:15.700
Who's the better shooter?

58:15.900 --> 58:16.900
- Irving.
- Why?

58:17.000 --> 58:18.500
He got them all in there.
Nothing's wasted.

58:18.550 --> 58:19.800
This ain't ladies embroidery.

58:19.850 --> 58:21.000
It don't have to be neat.

58:21.700 --> 58:22.700
If you got the time to set it up...

58:22.750 --> 58:24.500
and you need a clean hit,
you send Irving...

58:25.700 --> 58:29.150
but if you're in a tight spot,
you want Lulu next to you.

58:29.200 --> 58:32.297
Boom. It's all over
in a couple of seconds.

58:54.800 --> 58:57.400
Guess this is about as far from
where I come from as you can get.

58:59.700 --> 59:00.600
Where's that?

59:00.700 --> 59:03.200
The Bronx. Bathgate Avenue.

59:03.600 --> 59:04.600
We live in a tenement.

59:04.900 --> 59:05.700
Who's "we"?

59:06.500 --> 59:07.600
My mom and me.

59:08.500 --> 59:11.400
She works in a laundry,
gets $4.00 a week.

59:12.400 --> 59:14.200
You probably spend
more than that for lunch.

59:21.900 --> 59:25.400
Maybe you don't appreciate
the position you're in.

59:27.600 --> 59:29.000
What position is that?

59:30.900 --> 59:32.400
You're Mr. Schultz's girl.

59:33.200 --> 59:34.500
No, I'm not his girl.

59:35.200 --> 59:36.600
He's my gangster.

59:38.700 --> 59:39.600
Besides...

59:41.200 --> 59:43.200
you're the one
who's been looking after me.

59:45.700 --> 59:47.900
So far you seem to be
doing all right on your own.

59:52.200 --> 59:53.000
Meaning?

59:54.200 --> 59:55.900
What? Meaning?

59:57.300 --> 59:59.900
Tell me. Come on, tell me.

01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.550
Well, because...

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:02.400
Yes?

01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.200
Because Mr. Schultz
is a pushover for blondes.

01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:09.300
How do you know?

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:12.000
Because I read it in the paper.

01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.400
I don't read the papers.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:16.700
How are you supposed to know...

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:20.500
everything you need to know
if you don't read the paper?

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.000
What is it I need to know?

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:29.800
Maybe if you don't work
for a living...

01:00:29.850 --> 01:00:31.200
you don't need
to know anything...

01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.400
but some of us are trying
to learn a trade...

01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:39.000
and we have to be up
on the latest developments.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:44.400
Here's the latest development.

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.400
Arthur, do you renounce Satan?

01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:55.500
I do renounce him.

01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:59.000
- And all his works?
- Yes.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:01.600
- And all his promises?
- Yes.

01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.900
- And all his allurements?
- Yes.

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:14.000
Mr. Luciano, please place
your hand in position.

01:01:45.900 --> 01:01:49.900
As I said before, Mr. Luciano,
thanks very much.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:53.300
I'm just honored
to enter the Catholic Church...

01:01:53.350 --> 01:01:55.400
on the ticket
of such a man as yourself.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.400
I appreciate your coming.

01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.800
Where's Bo Weinberg?
Is he here today?

01:02:00.850 --> 01:02:02.100
I'm sorry. He couldn't make it.

01:02:02.150 --> 01:02:03.300
That's too bad.

01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.300
I never met him, but I hear
he's a man of character...

01:02:06.350 --> 01:02:07.700
a man to respect.

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:09.700
Yeah.

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:11.900
I'm sure he would've liked
to have met you, too.

01:02:12.700 --> 01:02:14.400
I'm making a party later,
and I'd be happy...

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:17.300
I wish I could, but
I got to get back to the city.

01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.850
Take care of yourself.

01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:21.300
Yeah.

01:09:38.399 --> 01:09:43.100
I want Mrs. Preston
out of here, fast.

01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:45.500
She can go to Saratoga,
see the races.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.899
She can go to
Lake George or Hong Kong.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.051
I don't care where she goes,
but I want her out of here...

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:54.450
and I'm depending on you
to get her out.

01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.650
Do you want me to leave?

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:56.700
The way Mr. Berman explained...

01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:58.850
I don't care about Mr. Berman.

01:09:58.900 --> 01:09:59.350
There'll be a lot of reporters...

01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:02.300
Is that what you want?
I want to hear it from you.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.800
He said they're going
to ask questions.

01:10:04.264 --> 01:10:05.450
Do you want me to leave?

01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:06.850
It's for your sake.

01:10:06.900 --> 01:10:09.500
I'm asking you a question.
Do you want me to leave?

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:13.900
No, I don't.

01:10:21.788 --> 01:10:24.414
It's polite to knock, Arthur.

01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:29.046
Am I missing anything?

01:10:30.484 --> 01:10:32.106
I've decided Mr. Berman
is right.

01:10:32.148 --> 01:10:34.274
I'll be going to Saratoga
for the races.

01:10:34.315 --> 01:10:37.508
And I'll be
taking Billy with me.

01:10:42.179 --> 01:10:44.871
Is that all right with you?

01:10:50.208 --> 01:10:53.106
I asked you a question, kid.

01:11:01.336 --> 01:11:02.562
I just want to tell you...

01:11:11.866 --> 01:11:14.591
Now everybody's happy.

01:11:16.630 --> 01:11:19.491
Mr. Schultz,
you worried about the trial?

01:11:19.528 --> 01:11:20.493
No, I'm not worried.

01:11:20.527 --> 01:11:22.752
I've been in
worser spots than this.

01:11:22.792 --> 01:11:24.520
How does it feel to be
public enemy number one?

01:11:24.558 --> 01:11:26.115
That's something
you made up for the papers.

01:11:26.157 --> 01:11:27.180
I'm no public enemy.

01:11:27.224 --> 01:11:29.189
- So, what are you?
- Public benefactor.

01:11:29.225 --> 01:11:30.520
Then how is it
that you were arrested...

01:11:30.555 --> 01:11:32.522
eleven times
before the age of 19?

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:35.042
Those were all cases
of mistaken identity.

01:11:35.085 --> 01:11:36.747
Is this a case
of mistaken identity?

01:11:36.787 --> 01:11:38.776
No, this is minor stuff-
income tax evasion.

01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:40.511
Are you sure
about that, Mr. Schultz?

01:11:40.551 --> 01:11:42.142
That's right. I'm no gorilla.

01:11:42.185 --> 01:11:43.242
I never killed nobody...

01:11:43.284 --> 01:11:44.748
and I never caused nobody
to get killed.

01:11:44.781 --> 01:11:46.080
Mr. Schultz!

01:11:46.116 --> 01:11:47.445
That's all the questions
we can take.

01:11:47.480 --> 01:11:50.446
Thank you. Thank you very much.

01:12:03.841 --> 01:12:05.999
All rise.

01:12:08.639 --> 01:12:10.501
Court is in session.

01:12:10.536 --> 01:12:12.004
Please be seated.

01:12:27.227 --> 01:12:29.160
Listen, I'll handle this.
Mr. Berman told me...

01:12:29.195 --> 01:12:30.559
Mr. Schultz owns
a piece of this hotel.

01:12:30.593 --> 01:12:32.150
He said they've
taken care of everything.

01:12:32.193 --> 01:12:33.819
Absolutely.

01:12:33.860 --> 01:12:35.585
Welcome back, Mrs. Preston.

01:12:35.627 --> 01:12:39.148
- It's good to see you again.
- Thank you, Charles.

01:12:39.191 --> 01:12:42.714
- Good afternoon, Mrs. Preston.
- Good afternoon.

01:12:42.757 --> 01:12:45.016
We're always delighted
to see you, Mrs. Preston.

01:12:45.055 --> 01:12:46.077
Hello, Francois.

01:12:46.121 --> 01:12:47.711
I've kept your suite
available, of course...

01:12:47.753 --> 01:12:50.183
and if you need anything,
please don't hesitate to ask.

01:12:50.217 --> 01:12:51.377
Thank you.

01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:53.643
- Mister-
- William Bathgate.

01:12:53.682 --> 01:12:55.772
Your room is just there.
And Mrs. Preston...

01:12:55.816 --> 01:12:58.009
Give the room
instructions to the valet.

01:12:58.047 --> 01:12:59.516
- He will handle everything.
- Very good.

01:12:59.547 --> 01:13:01.536
Has Mr. Preston told you
we were coming?

01:13:01.579 --> 01:13:03.975
Yes, just not this soon.
When he calls...

01:13:04.013 --> 01:13:05.534
Good to see you again.

01:13:14.041 --> 01:13:16.404
Mark my words.

01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.210
Good night, Billy.

01:14:16.245 --> 01:14:17.800
Good night.

01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:42.436
I won't tell him if you won't.

01:16:42.477 --> 01:16:45.306
It ain't funny, Mrs. Preston.

01:16:45.343 --> 01:16:47.102
You think Mr. Schultz
is an ordinary man.

01:16:47.143 --> 01:16:48.335
You're wrong. He's not.

01:16:48.374 --> 01:16:50.736
He's a maniac.

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:51.831
What we're doing...

01:16:51.874 --> 01:16:53.997
this is how people
get themselves killed.

01:16:54.039 --> 01:16:56.002
And what way is that?

01:16:56.038 --> 01:16:58.128
They don't stop
to calculate the odds.

01:16:58.171 --> 01:17:00.532
They don't stop to think.

01:17:00.567 --> 01:17:02.864
Can you calculate the odds?

01:17:02.903 --> 01:17:04.560
Yeah.

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:06.793
Yeah, I used to.

01:17:06.832 --> 01:17:08.561
I used to think
I had a charmed life.

01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:10.800
I used to think
I was one in a million.

01:17:11.300 --> 01:17:12.326
I had my wits.

01:17:12.370 --> 01:17:14.603
Whatever happened,
I would be fine.

01:17:14.642 --> 01:17:17.006
But now I've...

01:17:17.043 --> 01:17:21.105
I've lost my wits.
I've lost my place.

01:17:33.067 --> 01:17:35.501
Listen to me.

01:17:35.536 --> 01:17:38.097
You're smarter than he is
and braver.

01:17:39.508 --> 01:17:41.978
And you'll live longer
if you're not afraid.

01:17:46.651 --> 01:17:50.386
Oh, my poor Billy Bathgate.

01:17:52.561 --> 01:17:55.121
You made a promise
to protect me...

01:17:55.163 --> 01:17:58.463
and I'm not making it
easy for you, am I?

01:18:01.304 --> 01:18:03.467
No, ma'am, you're not.

01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:17.986
Are you awake?

01:18:21.967 --> 01:18:24.368
Can you hear me?

01:18:24.404 --> 01:18:25.997
Yes.

01:18:27.877 --> 01:18:30.038
I'm having breakfast
with the gang.

01:18:30.079 --> 01:18:31.570
What? What?

01:18:31.615 --> 01:18:35.176
No, no. My gang.

01:18:35.219 --> 01:18:37.916
Here. I've written it
all down for you.

01:18:37.957 --> 01:18:40.517
Meet me later at the track.

01:19:12.039 --> 01:19:13.198
Hello?

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:15.106
Where were you last night,
the two of you?

01:19:15.144 --> 01:19:16.907
We call, there's nobody there.

01:19:16.947 --> 01:19:19.175
Mr. Schultz doesn't like
that kind of thing.

01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:21.011
Is there something
I ought to know about?

01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:23.349
We had dinner at the Brook Club.

01:19:23.387 --> 01:19:26.324
Mrs. Preston met some friends-
silly people, nothing.

01:19:26.357 --> 01:19:27.620
Not for you, kid.

01:19:27.660 --> 01:19:29.458
Make sure she's at the track
in her box...

01:19:29.497 --> 01:19:32.157
by the third race,
box number 50.

01:19:32.199 --> 01:19:33.862
Why? What for?

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:36.838
Don't you know when somebody's
trying to look out for you?

01:19:36.872 --> 01:19:38.670
And one more thing.

01:19:38.709 --> 01:19:43.647
You don't have
to sit in her lap, got it?

01:19:48.590 --> 01:19:53.327
Jesus Christ.

01:19:53.363 --> 01:19:57.562
Get me the Savoy Plaza Hotel
in New York City.

01:20:01.709 --> 01:20:03.302
Savoy Plaza?

01:20:03.342 --> 01:20:05.573
I'd like to speak to
Mr. Harvey Preston.

01:20:08.318 --> 01:20:11.845
Mr. Preston, you don't know me.
I'm calling from Saratoga.

01:20:19.867 --> 01:20:22.497
- A club house ticket, please.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:30.250 --> 01:20:32.843
Sarsaparilla?
Yes. I'll be right back.

01:21:05.397 --> 01:21:06.455
Thirty-five cents.

01:21:06.497 --> 01:21:09.092
Why don't you keep the change?

01:21:11.673 --> 01:21:13.834
OK, we got 50 across the board!

01:21:13.875 --> 01:21:15.640
That's Election Day!

01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:27.188
Thank you very much.

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:38.370
Over here!

01:21:41.648 --> 01:21:43.516
John, let's go over here.

01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:45.416
Over here.

01:21:45.452 --> 01:21:47.421
$50.

01:21:47.454 --> 01:21:49.585
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:22:30.849 --> 01:22:33.216
Excuse me, please.

01:22:33.253 --> 01:22:34.516
Hey, hey, hey. Come here.

01:22:34.554 --> 01:22:35.887
Oh, Harriet, over here!

01:22:35.923 --> 01:22:38.257
Take these flowers
down to Mrs. Preston.

01:22:38.293 --> 01:22:40.263
- Mr. Wilson.
- Phil.

01:22:40.295 --> 01:22:41.558
Good afternoon, ladies.

01:22:44.236 --> 01:22:45.897
All of sudden
she just popped up...

01:22:45.938 --> 01:22:47.405
right there
in the Atlantic Ocean.

01:22:47.441 --> 01:22:49.499
I got to talk to you.

01:22:49.544 --> 01:22:51.173
Something's gone wrong.

01:22:51.212 --> 01:22:52.737
I think you're in
a lot of danger right now.

01:22:52.779 --> 01:22:55.044
Don't be so melodramatic, Billy.

01:22:55.081 --> 01:22:56.881
Mrs. Preston,
this is not a joke.

01:22:56.919 --> 01:23:00.380
Aren't they the most beautiful
things you've ever seen?

01:23:01.827 --> 01:23:04.695
Who do you like
in the next race, Charlotte?

01:23:10.139 --> 01:23:11.868
Flowers for Mrs. Preston.

01:23:11.906 --> 01:23:14.605
No. Look at these.

01:23:18.648 --> 01:23:24.319
Come on.

01:23:24.358 --> 01:23:27.453
Come on, Royal Honor.

01:23:27.497 --> 01:23:32.231
Billy, there was something
I wanted to tell you.

01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:35.331
Do you remember that man
who came to church?

01:23:35.375 --> 01:23:37.240
Which man?

01:23:37.277 --> 01:23:39.642
The one at
Mr. Schultz's baptism.

01:23:39.678 --> 01:23:41.341
The one he respects so much.

01:23:41.381 --> 01:23:43.247
Yes. Luciano.

01:23:43.285 --> 01:23:47.017
I've met him before.

01:23:47.056 --> 01:23:49.525
Where? With Bo?

01:23:49.561 --> 01:23:53.191
I was drunk.

01:23:53.231 --> 01:23:55.098
Did you ever tell Mr. Schultz?

01:23:55.136 --> 01:23:58.164
No. You think I should have?

01:24:01.810 --> 01:24:04.042
Go, Royal Honor!

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.674
Go! Come on!

01:24:06.717 --> 01:24:07.978
Go, Royal Honor!

01:24:08.020 --> 01:24:09.318
Go! Go! Come on!

01:24:09.353 --> 01:24:11.515
Go!

01:24:13.426 --> 01:24:14.690
Damn.

01:24:14.730 --> 01:24:16.526
I won! I won!

01:24:18.268 --> 01:24:19.529
I'm going to go bet.

01:24:19.569 --> 01:24:22.562
No, I'll do it. You stay here.

01:24:24.541 --> 01:24:29.207
All right.
Put $50 to win on Phantom Fox.

01:24:29.249 --> 01:24:30.772
Satisfied?

01:24:30.818 --> 01:24:33.846
Don't get up.
Don't leave until I get back.

01:24:33.889 --> 01:24:35.754
What if I have to pee?

01:24:35.791 --> 01:24:38.125
I'll bring you back a can.

01:24:48.576 --> 01:24:51.637
I love you, Mrs. Preston.

01:25:02.297 --> 01:25:03.661
Carter!

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:09.595
Hello, Drew, dear.

01:25:14.345 --> 01:25:15.643
What's the rush?

01:25:15.681 --> 01:25:18.242
- I thought I saw Irving.
- You did.

01:25:18.285 --> 01:25:19.377
Good to see you, my darling.

01:25:19.420 --> 01:25:22.720
Fancy meeting you here.

01:25:22.759 --> 01:25:25.226
I hope so.

01:25:27.298 --> 01:25:29.392
Oh, hello.

01:25:30.402 --> 01:25:31.595
Excuse me.

01:25:33.805 --> 01:25:34.863
Carter.

01:25:34.907 --> 01:25:38.572
- Drew, darling.
- Carter.

01:25:38.614 --> 01:25:40.309
Darling!

01:25:41.449 --> 01:25:43.181
Harvey.

01:25:43.219 --> 01:25:45.984
Harvey, what are you
doing here?

01:25:46.024 --> 01:25:47.959
Harvey!

01:25:47.993 --> 01:25:49.655
For God's sake, I've been
looking everywhere for you.

01:25:49.696 --> 01:25:51.459
I got the damnedest
telephone call.

01:25:51.498 --> 01:25:52.931
What the hell's going on?

01:25:52.966 --> 01:25:54.365
It's the husband.

01:25:56.805 --> 01:25:58.170
Come on.

01:26:12.027 --> 01:26:14.055
You should've told us.

01:26:14.097 --> 01:26:16.725
How was I to know?

01:26:30.287 --> 01:26:33.049
- What's this all about?
- It's the husband.

01:26:33.089 --> 01:26:35.524
Come on.

01:26:35.560 --> 01:26:37.153
What's with the state troopers?

01:26:37.195 --> 01:26:38.889
I don't know.
The guy's a big shot.

01:26:38.929 --> 01:26:42.163
The kind of stuff
big shots do, I guess.

01:27:07.371 --> 01:27:09.397
You didn't see this coming?

01:27:09.442 --> 01:27:12.705
Sure, like I saw it
coming with Lulu.

01:27:18.420 --> 01:27:19.547
I don't get it.

01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:21.420
She must've figured out
something.

01:27:21.458 --> 01:27:24.723
Nah, she didn't know nothing.

01:27:41.285 --> 01:27:44.619
Did she seem like
she was scared to you?

01:27:46.859 --> 01:27:50.263
She's not like ordinary people.

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:53.462
She's not scared of anything.

01:28:19.873 --> 01:28:21.933
Have you reached a verdict?

01:28:23.344 --> 01:28:24.936
Yes, we have, Your Honor.

01:28:24.979 --> 01:28:28.748
Will the defendant please rise?

01:28:32.858 --> 01:28:35.419
As to the charges,
how do you find the defendant...

01:28:35.460 --> 01:28:36.893
guilty or not guilty?

01:28:36.929 --> 01:28:38.420
We, the members of the jury...

01:28:38.465 --> 01:28:41.457
find the defendant...
not guilty.

01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:50.175
Congratulations.

01:28:50.214 --> 01:28:53.514
Thank you.

01:28:53.552 --> 01:28:55.522
- Hello, Irving, how-
- Yes. I'm good.

01:28:55.556 --> 01:28:57.922
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:28:57.959 --> 01:28:59.450
Come on in, come on in.

01:28:59.492 --> 01:29:02.293
- Is Mr. Schultz here?
- Yeah, he's upstairs.

01:29:02.332 --> 01:29:04.460
I'm sorry about
what happened to your nose.

01:29:04.501 --> 01:29:07.265
- Oh, don't worry.
- It was an accident.

01:29:07.305 --> 01:29:09.070
Mr. Schultz
is waiting for you upstairs.

01:29:09.108 --> 01:29:11.100
He wants me to go up there?

01:29:11.144 --> 01:29:13.806
Yeah, and have a good time.

01:29:27.399 --> 01:29:30.270
Hey, look who's here.

01:29:33.776 --> 01:29:36.039
Close the door, will you?

01:29:36.077 --> 01:29:38.206
I like a little privacy.

01:29:47.429 --> 01:29:49.362
Did she say anything?

01:29:49.397 --> 01:29:50.997
Who?

01:29:54.640 --> 01:29:56.835
Mrs. Preston?

01:29:56.876 --> 01:30:00.040
Yeah, I think
that's the lady's name.

01:30:00.079 --> 01:30:06.213
Yeah, she said
she liked you. Very much.

01:30:06.254 --> 01:30:08.521
She said you have class.

01:30:08.558 --> 01:30:10.686
She said that?

01:30:12.297 --> 01:30:14.026
Well, who knows?

01:30:14.066 --> 01:30:18.630
In a better world,
in another time...

01:30:23.644 --> 01:30:25.012
What?

01:30:25.047 --> 01:30:26.675
They've issued
another indictment.

01:30:26.718 --> 01:30:29.084
This time it's Dewey.
It's the state.

01:30:30.822 --> 01:30:32.689
What is it with this state income tax?

01:30:32.725 --> 01:30:34.695
And if I beat that,
what's next, city tax?

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:37.198
And after that,
Borough of the Bronx tax?

01:30:37.233 --> 01:30:38.789
And then Bathgate Avenue tax?

01:30:38.834 --> 01:30:41.167
It's not fair, Otto.

01:30:41.204 --> 01:30:43.195
We'll wait this out
in New Jersey.

01:30:43.239 --> 01:30:45.970
I'll get in touch with Hines
and work something out.

01:30:46.009 --> 01:30:49.276
What does a man have to do
to deserve a break?

01:30:49.315 --> 01:30:52.408
To be able to reap
the fruits of his labor?

01:30:52.451 --> 01:30:55.218
I'm gonna get Dewey.
I am gonna get that bastard.

01:30:55.257 --> 01:30:58.125
You can't kill Dewey.
He's too big.

01:30:58.161 --> 01:30:59.254
I want to know where he lives...

01:30:59.295 --> 01:31:00.730
what time
he comes out of his house.

01:31:00.765 --> 01:31:02.027
You gotta arrange it
with the gangs.

01:31:02.066 --> 01:31:03.657
You cannot just go ahead
on your own.

01:31:03.701 --> 01:31:05.968
Otto!

01:31:06.007 --> 01:31:09.636
Don't you ever tell me what
I can or cannot do, Otto.

01:31:09.676 --> 01:31:11.303
You work for me.

01:31:11.346 --> 01:31:15.009
You do as I tell you.
Is that clear?

01:31:23.329 --> 01:31:25.320
All right.

01:31:25.365 --> 01:31:27.997
We'll be moving across the river
to New Jersey for a while.

01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:30.365
Remember Hines?

01:31:30.402 --> 01:31:32.460
From Tammany Hall, the fixer.

01:31:32.503 --> 01:31:34.732
Right now he's our last chance.

01:31:34.772 --> 01:31:38.728
There are 17 one thousand
dollar bills in there.

01:31:38.776 --> 01:31:40.672
You tell him we're waiting
for an answer...

01:31:40.708 --> 01:31:44.406
at the Palace Chophouse
in Newark.

01:31:44.445 --> 01:31:46.810
You should've seen him
at the height of his power...

01:31:46.848 --> 01:31:48.973
when he had a grip on things.

01:31:49.014 --> 01:31:52.504
He was a king back then.

01:31:54.118 --> 01:31:56.985
You never saw
the real Dutch Schultz.

01:32:15.900 --> 01:32:18.163
A terrible thing
when the money won't flow.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:19.963
I'd hoped never to see the day.

01:32:20.002 --> 01:32:22.027
Nothing makes me sadder
than to refuse...

01:32:22.071 --> 01:32:23.299
such a generous offer.

01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:26.864
Mr. Hines, we need
your help with Dewey.

01:32:26.907 --> 01:32:29.842
Mr. Dewey is a prosecutor
who wants to be president.

01:32:29.877 --> 01:32:32.276
There is nothing I can do.
You tell Mr. Schultz...

01:32:32.313 --> 01:32:35.179
that the business
between us is over.

01:32:35.214 --> 01:32:37.179
Mr. Schultz
ain't gonna like this.

01:32:37.214 --> 01:32:38.680
He's always been
very generous with you.

01:32:38.716 --> 01:32:41.514
- He deserves-
- He deserves nothing.

01:32:45.654 --> 01:32:49.181
That son of a bitch.
That goddamn son of a bitch.

01:32:49.224 --> 01:32:50.520
What does he mean,
he won't take my money?

01:32:50.558 --> 01:32:53.458
Suddenly my money's
not good enough for him?

01:32:53.494 --> 01:32:54.960
He's a nothing, that scumbag.

01:32:54.996 --> 01:32:57.486
I'll take that money
and stick it in his teeth.

01:32:57.532 --> 01:32:59.724
Forget about him.
You got other problems.

01:32:59.763 --> 01:33:01.353
Don't tell me
to forget about him!

01:33:01.397 --> 01:33:02.694
You promised me Hines.

01:33:02.732 --> 01:33:05.860
You told me he'd take
care of us, and now this?

01:33:05.901 --> 01:33:10.804
Is this how good
your judgment is these days?

01:33:14.342 --> 01:33:16.571
Listen, you don't worry
about Dewey, all right?

01:33:16.608 --> 01:33:17.973
Dewey is as good as gone.

01:33:18.010 --> 01:33:19.341
You made an agreement with Luciano.

01:33:19.378 --> 01:33:20.675
I don't need his advisement on this.

01:33:20.714 --> 01:33:23.338
He drove hundreds of miles
to stand up for you in church.

01:33:23.381 --> 01:33:26.043
He didn't have the
decency to break bread with me.

01:33:26.083 --> 01:33:28.208
I don't trust that man.

01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:29.408
The man is sympathetic.

01:33:29.451 --> 01:33:31.181
Dewey's everybody's problem.

01:33:31.220 --> 01:33:34.211
Luciano knows, the Dutchman
gets knocked down, he's next.

01:33:34.255 --> 01:33:37.018
Meantime, I'm the one
in the frying pan!

01:33:37.057 --> 01:33:39.286
Now, let me tell you
for the final time...

01:33:39.325 --> 01:33:40.690
I will take Dewey out...

01:33:40.726 --> 01:33:42.627
and Luciano and his men
will thank me for it.

01:33:42.661 --> 01:33:43.855
Listen very carefully.

01:33:43.894 --> 01:33:46.193
They will come and they will
thank me for it.

01:33:46.229 --> 01:33:47.959
Mrs. Preston told me
something about him...

01:33:47.998 --> 01:33:50.864
about Luciano.

01:33:50.899 --> 01:33:54.960
She said that she thought
she'd seen him before.

01:33:57.169 --> 01:33:59.502
What are you talking about?

01:33:59.539 --> 01:34:02.303
She said...

01:34:02.341 --> 01:34:04.810
She said she was drunk...

01:34:04.844 --> 01:34:06.539
but she was
pretty sure it was him.

01:34:06.578 --> 01:34:09.978
She said she was with Bo.

01:34:10.013 --> 01:34:13.176
You hear this kid?

01:34:13.217 --> 01:34:15.183
This is what I'm talking about.

01:34:15.216 --> 01:34:18.084
This is why I say
that he is my prodigy.

01:34:19.254 --> 01:34:21.152
What else did she tell you?

01:34:21.186 --> 01:34:23.418
What else went on
with the two of you?!

01:34:23.457 --> 01:34:25.117
- All right.
- It's all right.

01:34:25.157 --> 01:34:26.715
I'm fine. What?

01:34:26.758 --> 01:34:30.193
- He's just a kid.
- I know. I'm calm.

01:34:35.464 --> 01:34:37.261
Get up.

01:34:37.298 --> 01:34:39.061
What did I do?

01:34:41.468 --> 01:34:43.493
That's for not telling me
sooner, kid.

01:34:43.537 --> 01:34:45.198
I tried.
I didn't have the chance.

01:34:45.239 --> 01:34:47.705
You should've come
to me right away.

01:34:47.741 --> 01:34:50.435
Even so, I didn't
hear the rest of you...

01:34:50.477 --> 01:34:52.670
give me the word on
our downtown compare.

01:34:52.710 --> 01:34:55.406
- That's not fair.
- Shut the fuck up, Lulu.

01:34:55.446 --> 01:34:59.107
You're ugly and dumb,
and that's the truth of you.

01:35:00.482 --> 01:35:02.507
Otto, get Dixie on the phone.

01:35:02.549 --> 01:35:04.039
I want him over here
right away.

01:35:04.084 --> 01:35:05.312
Right.

01:35:05.353 --> 01:35:08.948
Fix me a rye.
Make it straight up.

01:35:08.989 --> 01:35:11.513
That conniving dago scum.

01:35:11.558 --> 01:35:14.684
Can you tell me how
you know what he respects?

01:35:14.724 --> 01:35:16.954
Me, I like something,
I tell you...

01:35:16.994 --> 01:35:19.654
I don't like something,
I tell you that.

01:35:19.694 --> 01:35:21.820
You cross me,
I fucking kill you.

01:35:21.863 --> 01:35:23.194
Everything is clear.

01:35:23.231 --> 01:35:25.630
Everything's above board
and honest, right, Irving?

01:35:28.669 --> 01:35:31.035
I see the whole world
ganging up on me.

01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:33.800
I see the man who takes me
into his church...

01:35:33.839 --> 01:35:35.568
the man who makes me
his brother...

01:35:35.609 --> 01:35:37.903
and embraces me,
kisses me on the cheek...

01:35:37.941 --> 01:35:41.968
is the same man
who turns my Bo against me.

01:35:42.011 --> 01:35:43.978
Is that love...

01:35:44.012 --> 01:35:46.640
or is that
the Sicilian kiss of death?

01:35:46.682 --> 01:35:49.344
I don't care how many DA's
come after me.

01:35:49.385 --> 01:35:51.350
Whatever has to be done,
I'll do.

01:35:51.386 --> 01:35:53.147
They think
that I am finished...

01:35:53.186 --> 01:35:55.847
but I will show them.

01:35:55.888 --> 01:35:57.947
Come on, boys, give me a smile.

01:35:59.489 --> 01:36:01.320
The Dutchman's
making a comeback.

01:36:13.801 --> 01:36:16.165
What is this?
I asked for scotch.

01:36:16.202 --> 01:36:18.171
Can't you do
one damn thing right?

01:36:18.204 --> 01:36:19.172
But you just told me...

01:36:19.207 --> 01:36:21.832
I'm fed up with you.
You're fired.

01:36:21.873 --> 01:36:23.065
What?

01:36:23.105 --> 01:36:25.835
I don't want to tell you twice.
Get out of here.

01:36:25.876 --> 01:36:28.900
- Why?
- Know why I'm firing you?

01:36:28.944 --> 01:36:30.913
You always want to know
the reasons for things...

01:36:30.948 --> 01:36:33.276
always asking questions,
poking your nose...

01:36:33.314 --> 01:36:34.542
into things
that don't concern you.

01:36:34.582 --> 01:36:36.641
- But you-
- Always interrupting.

01:36:36.683 --> 01:36:39.311
And most of all,
I'm sick of the sight of you.

01:36:39.352 --> 01:36:40.339
Mr. Berman...

01:36:40.385 --> 01:36:42.617
I don't want to hear
anymore, now beat it.

01:36:42.656 --> 01:36:46.349
You can't fire me.
I work for Mr. Schultz.

01:36:46.389 --> 01:36:49.517
Mr. Schultz does the hiring,
I do the firing.

01:36:49.560 --> 01:36:53.426
Here's your severance pay.
Get lost.

01:36:55.896 --> 01:36:57.921
What's the matter with you?

01:36:57.965 --> 01:37:00.797
Can't you get it through that
thick Irish skull of yours...

01:37:00.834 --> 01:37:03.825
that we don't want you?
None of us.

01:37:03.870 --> 01:37:05.599
We never did.

01:37:37.257 --> 01:37:39.557
Now, there goes a kid
with luck.

01:37:50.903 --> 01:37:52.563
Get him, Charlie!

01:37:56.971 --> 01:37:58.599
Don't say a fucking thing.

01:38:21.522 --> 01:38:25.051
- I heard shots!
- What's going on?

01:38:25.092 --> 01:38:26.992
Somebody call the police!

01:38:27.026 --> 01:38:29.155
Come on.

01:38:29.195 --> 01:38:31.526
All right, move it!

01:38:31.564 --> 01:38:32.531
Come on.

01:38:34.167 --> 01:38:36.464
Go, go, go!

01:38:36.501 --> 01:38:38.490
Get down!

01:38:54.279 --> 01:38:55.768
Dixie?

01:38:55.813 --> 01:38:58.442
What the hell'd
you bring him here for?

01:38:58.483 --> 01:39:01.315
Dixie, what's going on?

01:39:01.351 --> 01:39:03.683
What's the matter with you guys?

01:39:03.719 --> 01:39:06.415
You double-crossed him.

01:39:06.456 --> 01:39:10.016
You sold him out,
you son of a bitch!

01:39:20.131 --> 01:39:21.757
Bravo, kid.

01:39:25.835 --> 01:39:27.825
Tell these guys
to get rid of him.

01:39:27.868 --> 01:39:29.131
What's the matter, Dixie?

01:39:29.171 --> 01:39:32.005
He was at the chophouse.
He's a witness.

01:39:33.675 --> 01:39:35.301
Sorry, kid.

01:39:35.341 --> 01:39:37.242
What are you gonna do
when he crosses you...

01:39:37.277 --> 01:39:38.835
like he did Mr. Schultz?

01:39:38.878 --> 01:39:40.708
- Don't worry, he won't.
- No?

01:39:40.745 --> 01:39:42.610
Why don't you ask him
about the money?

01:39:43.950 --> 01:39:45.005
What money?

01:39:45.049 --> 01:39:47.483
He was sitting
on 5, 6 million in cash.

01:39:47.516 --> 01:39:50.952
We didn't come across anything
like that, did we?

01:39:50.987 --> 01:39:52.646
Lucky, we've been
all through this before.

01:39:52.688 --> 01:39:53.915
They were broke.

01:39:53.955 --> 01:39:56.115
They didn't have the money
for payoffs or for salaries.

01:39:56.156 --> 01:39:58.126
What about the safe?

01:39:58.159 --> 01:40:00.318
Otto Berman had a safe.
I took a look inside.

01:40:00.360 --> 01:40:01.828
It was empty.
There was nothing in it.

01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:05.227
That's not true. I saw it.
It was full of cash.

01:40:05.263 --> 01:40:07.729
He's lying. You gonna
listen to some punk kid?

01:40:07.763 --> 01:40:10.461
He's nothing, nobody.
All he did was sweep up.

01:40:10.500 --> 01:40:11.991
They never let him
near the money.

01:40:12.034 --> 01:40:14.059
How come Mr. Berman
gave me this?

01:40:19.039 --> 01:40:21.008
Here, here.

01:40:28.180 --> 01:40:31.510
This is a lot of money.

01:40:31.547 --> 01:40:34.142
Dixie, if you're
holding out on me...

01:40:34.184 --> 01:40:37.015
it's not the right way to start
a business relationship.

01:40:37.053 --> 01:40:38.679
Maybe we ought to have
a little talk.

01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.516
Charlie, Pete.

01:40:41.553 --> 01:40:43.579
Lucky.

01:40:44.825 --> 01:40:46.793
Lucky, I told you the truth.

01:40:46.826 --> 01:40:48.759
Don't worry, Dixie.
This won't take long.

01:40:59.299 --> 01:41:02.269
What am I gonna do with you?

01:41:02.303 --> 01:41:04.825
You got brains, you got guts.

01:41:04.871 --> 01:41:06.100
I like that...

01:41:06.139 --> 01:41:08.573
but Dixie's right.
You know too much.

01:41:08.609 --> 01:41:10.301
So, what am I gonna do?

01:41:10.343 --> 01:41:13.276
But maybe I know
a few things, too.

01:41:13.310 --> 01:41:17.678
For instance, I know
where Bathgate Avenue is...

01:41:17.714 --> 01:41:20.012
I know where
you buy your cigarettes...

01:41:20.051 --> 01:41:22.883
and I know the laundry
where your mother works.

01:41:22.918 --> 01:41:28.288
I guess it all evens out,
don't it?

01:41:29.589 --> 01:41:31.919
Take care of yourself, kid.

01:41:35.861 --> 01:41:38.020
Can I have my money?

01:41:47.835 --> 01:41:52.101
Sure. Why not?

01:42:01.277 --> 01:42:03.939
I'll be looking in on you
from time to time...

01:42:03.978 --> 01:42:06.412
just to see how
you're getting along.

01:42:06.448 --> 01:42:08.110
Remember that.

01:42:29.565 --> 01:42:32.363
Hey, kid, you want a ride?

01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:34.197
No, thanks. I'll walk.
