00:00.823 --> 00:03.273
What's this about?
Family members are missing.

00:03.298 --> 00:05.015
Police think it's an
extortion racket.

00:05.040 --> 00:06.159
Is it my mother's?

00:06.184 --> 00:09.085
You trusted them?! I wanted to know
if Mama is still alive.

00:09.110 --> 00:10.550
There is no-one you can trust!

00:10.575 --> 00:11.775
I know what you are.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.360
I know what you did with the van.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.600
Where can you go where
you'll be safe?

00:15.640 --> 00:18.040
I'm not buying her. I'm taking her.

00:18.080 --> 00:19.959
You come near me again,
I'll kill you!

00:19.960 --> 00:22.919
Murder weapon? No obvious wood
splinter. A metal bar?

00:22.920 --> 00:24.120
Metal bar would do it.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.017
Wear this. You'll be safer.

00:27.800 --> 00:30.400
A267. B means "Back to London".

00:30.440 --> 00:32.240
94 kilometres to Charing Cross.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.360
It's not a password. It's a place.

Please! Where is my brother?

01:50.200 --> 01:51.959
When will I see him?

01:51.960 --> 01:54.920
Please, I have no more money...

01:54.960 --> 01:56.560
Where is he? Please. Please!

01:59.000 --> 02:00.679
When will I...?

02:00.680 --> 02:01.680
Oh, please!

03:03.520 --> 03:05.440
THEY MOAN AND
HIT THE WALLS

03:59.800 --> 04:02.080
SOFTLY SINGING

04:44.800 --> 04:46.600
FOGHORN BLASTS

04:50.960 --> 04:55.839
PA: 'Ladies and gentlemen, we
will shortly be arriving at Dover.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.360
'Le ferry est sur le point
de partir.

04:58.400 --> 05:01.400
'Les passagers sont pries de
se rendre sur les points...'

05:06.720 --> 05:08.000
Please.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.000
Please. Please.

06:02.360 --> 06:05.040
Do we have any idea
who these dead people are?

06:05.080 --> 06:07.800
No, not yet.
None of the bodies had ID on them.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.960
Trafficking? I think so.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.359
I need Butler in the loop.

06:13.360 --> 06:15.720
I think these deaths are related
to the killings in London.

06:15.760 --> 06:18.600
You think that?
These people died weeks ago.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.000
The London victims are recent.

06:20.040 --> 06:23.600
Both of my London victims
had the A-road location marker

06:23.640 --> 06:25.480
in messages in their phone.

06:25.520 --> 06:26.680
How are they involved?

06:28.360 --> 06:29.960
I don't know.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.400
Ugh, no signal.

06:32.840 --> 06:35.840
You have to...
You have to walk out to the road.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.720
Out to the road?
How did you call me?

06:39.640 --> 06:40.920
I walked out to the road.

07:10.440 --> 07:11.600
I'm not a thief.

07:13.360 --> 07:16.040
Can you work for a place to stay?

07:19.560 --> 07:21.160
Was it a mistake?

07:21.200 --> 07:22.999
They know when the van passed
through Dover,

07:23.000 --> 07:24.280
did they die en route?

07:24.320 --> 07:26.400
Two murdered men knew the location.

07:26.440 --> 07:29.880
So someone kills Jamal al Sham and
Kali Aziz to keep the van hidden.

07:29.920 --> 07:31.680
Did they know? The van was hidden.

07:32.760 --> 07:34.960
Why would you hide it?

07:35.000 --> 07:37.600
Because you open the doors
when you arrived and found

07:37.640 --> 07:39.760
the people inside were dead.

07:39.800 --> 07:42.039
You didn't know what to do,
so you hid the van.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.079
No.

07:44.080 --> 07:46.520
The panels of the van
were pressed out.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.080
You can see where they kicked
and pounded the doors.

07:52.880 --> 07:55.760
If it happened en route,
the driver would have known.

07:55.800 --> 07:59.040
Someone would have noticed.
Border Force, another driver.

08:01.200 --> 08:04.200
No, they were alive
when they got here.

08:06.480 --> 08:11.200
Hidden in the trees
and left to die, slowly.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.400
In a metal prison they thought
was going to save them.

09:03.560 --> 09:04.719
Assalamu alaikum.

09:04.720 --> 09:05.919
Wa alaikum assalaam.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.880
Zakat.

09:07.920 --> 09:10.200
Thanks for your help
and everything you do.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.120
Written in blood? Yeah.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.280
DNA.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.799
Police.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.680
Do you rent rooms here?

09:39.720 --> 09:42.120
Yeah? How many people you got
staying here?

09:44.480 --> 09:45.480
What's your name?

09:46.600 --> 09:47.600
Fred.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.640
We found this address written
next to the body of a gentleman

09:50.680 --> 09:52.519
who had passed away, Fred.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.720
We have a facial reconstruction.

09:54.760 --> 09:55.960
Do you recognise him?

10:01.800 --> 10:02.800
No.

10:05.120 --> 10:06.959
We have a warrant to search
these premises,

10:06.960 --> 10:09.359
would you open the door, please?

10:09.360 --> 10:12.159
OK. I open the door. OK?

10:12.160 --> 10:13.160
Thank you.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.680
He's running.

10:25.720 --> 10:26.720
Go!

10:39.120 --> 10:40.440
You all right? Yeah. Yeah.

10:58.040 --> 10:59.040
We did this.

11:00.600 --> 11:04.279
We locked them in the back
of the van and left them to die.

11:04.280 --> 11:06.479
We created the problem

11:06.480 --> 11:09.279
and then we slammed the door.

11:09.280 --> 11:10.480
Oh, God.

11:11.680 --> 11:12.680
Teeth marks.

11:15.760 --> 11:16.760
We made them beasts.

11:18.240 --> 11:22.680
The beasts are the people
that put them in the van, Nikki.

11:22.720 --> 11:25.720
Gave them false hope
and took their money.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.359
And then their humanity.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.679
If people migrate illegally,
then they put themselves in danger.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.040
Hobson's choice.
They're in danger if they stay.

11:34.080 --> 11:37.519
We've consistently said we will help
refugees, just only from a camp.

11:37.520 --> 11:39.879
Then we've been
consistently inhuman.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.999
There are 14 million of them...
"Them"?

11:42.000 --> 11:43.560
What, we, we just take them all?

11:43.600 --> 11:46.120
Take them in or leave them to die?
Not a tough choice for me.

11:46.160 --> 11:48.440
Nikki, we can't afford it.

12:02.520 --> 12:03.520
What is it?

12:14.720 --> 12:17.760
Someone's dreams of the future.
Diamonds.

12:19.200 --> 12:22.159
They don't want to be a burden,
Thomas.

12:22.160 --> 12:23.200
They want to be safe.

13:38.600 --> 13:39.880
Where are you coming from, sir?

13:39.920 --> 13:41.639
Calais, but I'm from Belgium.

13:41.640 --> 13:43.640
You are... You're Brian?

13:45.040 --> 13:46.480
No, I'm not.

13:46.520 --> 13:48.239
Began your journey in Belgium?

13:48.240 --> 13:49.240
Yeah.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.039
Is this your van?

13:52.040 --> 13:53.559
Aboon Dbashmayo...

13:53.560 --> 13:55.360
No, actually, I borrowed it
from a friend.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.040
Nethcadash shmokh...

13:57.080 --> 13:58.640
You borrowed it?

13:58.680 --> 14:00.320
Yes. Teethe malkoothokh...

14:02.080 --> 14:03.680
Nehwe sebyonokh...

14:05.320 --> 14:07.840
Are you aware of your customs
allowances, sir? Yes.

14:10.480 --> 14:12.719
May we take a look in the back,
please?

14:12.720 --> 14:13.720
Sure.

14:43.800 --> 14:46.680
Can you pull into the inspection
bay, please, sir. Mmm-hmm.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.120
His brother was in the van.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.200
Does he know?

15:02.560 --> 15:05.480
Those from the van?
Yeah. All dead...

15:07.200 --> 15:09.760
Bad choice of words. Yeah.

15:09.800 --> 15:10.880
They're charging.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.159
I cross checked the address books,

15:16.160 --> 15:20.359
numbers received and numbers dialled
on our two victims,

15:20.360 --> 15:22.679
Jamal and Kali's phones... And?

15:22.680 --> 15:26.200
And they had each other's numbers.

15:26.240 --> 15:30.199
One French mobile number in common,
under the letters YH.

15:30.200 --> 15:34.359
One English mobile number in common,
marked AW.

15:34.360 --> 15:36.799
Both have the MemoWire
messenger app.

15:36.800 --> 15:37.800
Hmm.

15:45.880 --> 15:49.240
ALL PHONES BLEEP/VIBRATE
WITH MULTIPLE NEW MESSAGES

15:53.040 --> 15:54.360
What should we do, Jack?

15:56.520 --> 15:57.520
Jack?

16:04.560 --> 16:07.879
The messages are being sent
by the phones I found in the van.

16:07.880 --> 16:11.720
"Please, in the name of God,
don't let us die this way."

16:13.160 --> 16:15.359
They were locked
in the back of the van.

16:15.360 --> 16:18.200
No signal in the forest,
the messages didn't send.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.040
Batteries ran out
searching for signal.

16:22.080 --> 16:24.320
"Help us. We're dying."

16:27.400 --> 16:28.680
Messages from the dead.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.519
But this world...

16:33.520 --> 16:35.119
it's nothing.

16:35.120 --> 16:37.400
Soiled, meaningless.

16:37.440 --> 16:40.999
We must say to the kafir
as the Koran has taught us -

16:41.000 --> 16:43.200
you have rejected the truth,

16:43.240 --> 16:44.800
so, sooner or later...

16:44.840 --> 16:46.880
PHONE RINGS

16:56.840 --> 16:58.280
..a punishment will come.

17:07.119 --> 17:09.359
MULTIPLE PHONE ALERTS

18:05.920 --> 18:07.480
Turn that off, please.

18:10.800 --> 18:13.639
Off! Not in church.

18:13.640 --> 18:14.640
Sorry.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.560
Afternoon, chaps. What do we have?

18:49.160 --> 18:51.719
All right, gents.
There's no need to empty it.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.640
Load it back up.

18:54.680 --> 18:57.280
Thank you for your time, sir.
I'll let you be back on your way.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.520
DOORS CLOSE

19:02.560 --> 19:04.600
ENGINE FIRES, VAN MOVES

19:17.920 --> 19:21.200
I told you to turn that off
in the church.

19:21.240 --> 19:22.280
I need to find her.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.240
My mother, she is alive.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.200
TEXT ALERT

19:55.200 --> 19:56.200
What is it?

19:58.080 --> 20:00.440
Akka just received
a message from her mother.

20:04.520 --> 20:06.560
Restores your faith in the universe.

20:13.440 --> 20:17.320
This was four weeks ago
at Dover customs control.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.960
We don't get a clear view
of the driver from the video,

20:20.000 --> 20:23.200
but, from the time stamp,
we managed to retrieve his passport.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.519
Alan Wilson.

20:27.520 --> 20:29.840
He's from Croydon.

20:29.880 --> 20:31.320
He was a youth offender,

20:31.360 --> 20:34.760
convicted of grievous bodily harm
and sent down for seven months.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.200
His exact whereabouts at the moment
are unknown...

20:37.240 --> 20:39.160
It seems likely the van
came through Dover

20:39.200 --> 20:41.760
and was secreted and abandoned
soon afterwards.

20:41.800 --> 20:46.040
All seven victims in the van
died of hypertonic dehydration.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.080
Lack of fluid.

20:48.720 --> 20:51.040
It takes between
three and five days to die.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.280
Depending on your general health.

20:57.840 --> 21:02.160
All right, he parks the van
amongst the trees and... goes?

21:02.200 --> 21:04.200
Was Jamal or Kali Aziz
meant to collect the van

21:04.240 --> 21:05.200
and the people in it?

21:05.240 --> 21:06.839
We don't know the answer.

21:06.840 --> 21:07.840
Alan Wilson does.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.400
Fingerprints,
rear panel of the van...

21:16.440 --> 21:18.160
Brian Hunt.

21:18.200 --> 21:19.440
Works for Border Force.

21:34.840 --> 21:36.720
Mr Hunt?

21:36.760 --> 21:39.160
How much do you lot get paid?

21:39.200 --> 21:41.600
New? Yeah.

21:41.640 --> 21:44.039
Pia Butler.
I'm from Immigration Enforcement.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.959
I'm helping the police investigate
the deaths of seven people.

21:46.960 --> 21:48.319
The ones in the van? Yeah.

21:48.320 --> 21:50.320
Yeah, I heard.
It was a terrible tragedy.

21:50.360 --> 21:51.840
Shouldn't have happened. No.

21:51.880 --> 21:53.999
They came through Dover? Yeah.

21:54.000 --> 21:55.560
And I was the Duty Officer?

21:57.040 --> 21:58.960
Did you look in the van?

21:59.000 --> 22:01.519
A white van?
I would have thought so.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.959
Not always. Sometimes I'll just have
a chat with the driver.

22:03.960 --> 22:05.919
Your fingerprints
were on the rear handle.

22:05.920 --> 22:08.400
Well, then I looked.
But not on the padlock.

22:09.840 --> 22:11.839
Well, then I didn't.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.360
It really is a very nice car.

22:15.320 --> 22:19.239
Look, I can see what you're trying
to do and say without saying it.

22:19.240 --> 22:22.840
I'm not bent. And you've got
no evidence apart my very nice car.

22:22.880 --> 22:24.719
And you are well out of order.

22:24.720 --> 22:28.920
You know, when I spoke to HR, they
told me you gave your notice in.

22:28.960 --> 22:30.760
Yeah. It's my last week. Why?

22:30.800 --> 22:33.279
Seems like the job's been
good to you.

22:33.280 --> 22:37.319
Have you ever had to pull a migrant
out of the crawl space of a lorry -

22:37.320 --> 22:40.280
someone who's risked their lives
to get where you're standing -

22:40.320 --> 22:43.240
and then send them on to some
overcrowded immigration referral centre?

22:43.280 --> 22:44.599
Every day.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.960
Well, I got tired of shattering
someone else's dreams.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.080
And one day, so will you.

22:48.120 --> 22:51.040
So you decided to look
the other way?

22:51.080 --> 22:52.160
You broke the law.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.120
Well, good luck with that.

22:56.160 --> 22:59.680
Because if I don't find anything,
then I don't find anything.

22:59.720 --> 23:03.240
I guarantee you, the seven victims
we found, they wished you had.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.799
Blood on the iron bar found
in the skip matches Kali Aziz.

23:14.800 --> 23:18.280
Injuries to the victim are blunt
force made with a linear object.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.280
It's the murder weapon. Thanks.

23:20.320 --> 23:21.960
We lifted a clean print
from the bar, yes?

23:22.000 --> 23:23.960
Yep. And from the van.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.800
You outdid yourself.
I'll write it up.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.199
Alan Wilson, when was he in prison?

23:29.200 --> 23:33.320
2008. His prints and DNA will
be on the database. Yeah, I know.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.400
It's Wilson's prints on the van.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.520
And the iron bar.

23:45.960 --> 23:46.960
What's up?

23:48.160 --> 23:51.600
I put Akka's DNA onto the database
when we checked the tissue.

23:52.840 --> 23:55.160
She is the mother of Akka Khoury.

24:02.160 --> 24:05.439
What, so Akka received an old
message when they came through today?

24:05.440 --> 24:07.840
And believed that...
Her mother was alive.

24:12.560 --> 24:15.119
Do you want me to..? No.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.120
I'll tell her.

24:21.480 --> 24:25.720
The person who's extorting money
from Akka's family,

24:25.760 --> 24:29.160
they'd have known her mother
was dead in the back of a van.

24:48.280 --> 24:50.640
DRIVER GETS OUT

25:41.520 --> 25:45.080
Elia Khoury, Akka's mother,
was one of the deceased.

25:45.120 --> 25:48.360
She was dead for a month while money
was extorted from her family.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.840
Whoever did this
used the van as a prison.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.160
Jack? Have you got it?
Trafficker and extortionist.

25:53.200 --> 25:56.280
Likely to be the same person
or persons.

25:56.320 --> 25:58.320
Sorry, I was waiting on the e-mail,
just came in.

25:58.360 --> 26:01.199
Blood on the cuff
of Gyearbuor Asante's sweatshirt.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.519
DNA match with Alan Wilson.
Proves contact.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.240
Asante's brother
was in the back of the van.

26:05.280 --> 26:07.360
They were extorting from him
as well.

26:35.040 --> 26:37.040
DRIVER GETS IN

26:38.400 --> 26:40.280
ENGINE FIRES

27:02.000 --> 27:03.679
She's alive!

27:03.680 --> 27:06.079
I wrote her,
but she didn't respond...

27:06.080 --> 27:07.200
I need to find her.

27:09.080 --> 27:10.440
What should I do?

27:10.480 --> 27:12.319
I don't want to go to the police.

27:12.320 --> 27:13.520
What should I do?

27:50.680 --> 27:52.160
VAN STOPS

28:00.160 --> 28:02.280
DRIVER GETS OUT

28:14.680 --> 28:16.280
My brother, Eapen?

28:18.880 --> 28:20.920
We found a young boy
in the back of the van.

28:27.200 --> 28:28.200
My aunt?

28:29.280 --> 28:30.280
My cousin?

28:31.320 --> 28:32.320
My uncle?

28:49.240 --> 28:51.080
It doesn't really look like her.

29:18.040 --> 29:19.560
Assalamu alaikum.

29:19.600 --> 29:21.279
Wa alaikum assalaam.

29:21.280 --> 29:22.680
Where's Jamal?

29:22.720 --> 29:24.959
I don't know. I hoped you did.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.536
No, I went round to Kali.
He's not there.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.560
Tried to call him, a woman answered.
Where is he?

29:28.600 --> 29:29.960
I haven't heard from him.

29:31.280 --> 29:33.279
I got some messages today.

29:33.280 --> 29:34.280
Old messages.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.999
Seen the news?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.960
I saw.

29:40.000 --> 29:42.400
Messages from those people.

29:42.440 --> 29:44.720
Messages from the dead.

29:44.760 --> 29:46.879
I have to go. Prayers.

29:46.880 --> 29:47.920
How did this happen?

29:49.120 --> 29:50.720
Ask Jamal. Ask Kali.

29:50.760 --> 29:52.439
No, I tried. Now I'm asking you.

29:52.440 --> 29:54.360
You were the driver. What happened?

29:54.400 --> 29:56.640
They were kafirs.
Why do you care about them?

29:56.680 --> 29:59.799
Every one of them was a kafir.
They lost everything.

29:59.800 --> 30:02.319
It's what they deserve.

30:02.320 --> 30:04.399
Well, they don't have to worry
about that now, do they?

30:04.400 --> 30:06.360
Did Jamal and Kali do this?

30:06.400 --> 30:08.000
I don't know what happened.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.736
The van was parked in dense woodland,
that's what it said in the paper.

30:10.760 --> 30:12.479
Someone must have driven it there.

30:12.480 --> 30:14.465
Now, I sent a van yesterday,
did you meet it?

30:14.490 --> 30:15.698
I thought Kali was meeting it.

30:15.723 --> 30:18.802
Now, why would you think that?
You haven't heard from Kali.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.800
Are they safe, Abdul?
They're apostate.

30:21.840 --> 30:23.800
Are they safe? Hey, hey, look at me.

30:24.880 --> 30:27.800
"Those who reject Faith after they
accepted it,

30:27.840 --> 30:29.799
"never will their
repentance be accepted..."

30:29.800 --> 30:33.400
Only Allah can change the essence
of a man, who he is.

30:33.440 --> 30:34.479
I am a true believer.

30:34.480 --> 30:37.640
Business is something we accept,
but a person who could do this?

30:37.680 --> 30:38.999
Let go of me, you filthy kafir.

30:39.000 --> 30:42.320
That person is an insult
to the Prophet.

30:42.360 --> 30:44.640
That person is not
a slave to Allah, Abdul.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.800
That person is an impostor.

31:01.840 --> 31:05.280
Your mother brought these with her
to help you start a new life.

31:05.320 --> 31:06.360
They belong to you.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.560
Take them.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.080
You have my brother here?

31:26.120 --> 31:28.400
Go inside. I want my brother's body.

31:28.440 --> 31:30.240
Who is your brother? Kwabena Asante.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.479
Do you have him here?

31:31.480 --> 31:34.799
If your brother is here, the police
will need you to identify him.

31:34.800 --> 31:38.599
No police.
I only want to bury my brother.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.840
Open the door. I can't let you in...
Give me my brother's body!

31:41.880 --> 31:43.760
What is wrong with you
English people, huh?

31:43.800 --> 31:45.480
Do you not feel nothing?

31:45.520 --> 31:47.759
Give him to me... Everything OK?

31:47.760 --> 31:48.760
They killed him.

31:49.800 --> 31:54.239
He was a sweet, good man
and they killed him for money.

31:54.240 --> 31:56.240
Please. Please...

31:56.280 --> 31:59.920
I need to bury my brother
so he can rest in peace.

31:59.960 --> 32:03.560
We can't release his body to you
until the police say we can.

32:03.600 --> 32:05.760
I'm sorry... Please!
I'm really sorry, bud.

32:07.040 --> 32:08.440
They took money from me.

32:09.880 --> 32:12.480
They said he would be safe.

32:12.520 --> 32:16.599
Then tell the police
and give your brother justice.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.000
You don't understand.

32:59.080 --> 33:01.599
They've been looking for you.

33:01.600 --> 33:03.680
I told them the news.

33:03.720 --> 33:04.720
God bless you all.

33:06.360 --> 33:07.360
Where is Elia?

33:10.640 --> 33:13.240
You said she had gone
to get her mother.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.280
Where is she?

33:16.120 --> 33:17.120
Where?

33:18.520 --> 33:19.520
Akka?

33:21.520 --> 33:23.480
Elia is dead.

33:23.520 --> 33:25.400
Eapen is dead.

33:25.440 --> 33:27.519
They died a month ago
in the back of the van

33:27.520 --> 33:29.480
that brought them here from Calais.

33:29.520 --> 33:31.320
That's not true.

33:31.360 --> 33:32.760
I'm sorry.

33:32.800 --> 33:34.760
I will kill them.

33:34.800 --> 33:36.879
I will find them
and I will kill them!

33:36.880 --> 33:38.640
Liar!

33:38.680 --> 33:40.640
Why did you say she was alive?

33:40.680 --> 33:42.200
She thought she was. Liar!

33:42.240 --> 33:44.120
No! She's not a liar.

33:44.160 --> 33:47.160
She's lost her mother...
My daughter!

33:47.200 --> 33:49.400
Only a coward would hurt her.

33:49.440 --> 33:50.440
I'm not a coward.

33:53.880 --> 33:56.799
Come with me. I'll find you
somewhere safe to stay.

33:56.800 --> 34:00.560
Make sure you're looked after.
I am NOT a coward!

34:00.600 --> 34:02.360
Come with me.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.839
Please.

34:03.840 --> 34:04.879
It is how they are.

34:04.880 --> 34:08.679
Akka, you can't accept how they are.
I have no-one else.

34:08.719 --> 34:09.800
Akka...

34:55.840 --> 34:58.840
THEY SHOUT
"HELP" REPEATEDLY

35:08.240 --> 35:10.720
BANGING AND
SHOUTING CONTINUES

35:18.880 --> 35:20.400
Have you logged all the messages?

35:20.440 --> 35:22.879
I did Jamal al Sham's
phone yesterday.

35:22.880 --> 35:25.040
And I was just checking
the Kali Aziz phone

35:25.080 --> 35:26.520
and I found another message.

35:29.960 --> 35:31.520
A new road marker location?

35:33.440 --> 35:34.440
Another van?

35:37.280 --> 35:38.559
DIALLING

35:38.560 --> 35:41.520
Detective Chief Inspector?
Jack Hodgson.

35:41.560 --> 35:43.840
We potentially have another van.

37:11.040 --> 37:13.920
DISTANT BANGING
AND CRIES FOR HELP

37:37.440 --> 37:40.200
BANGING AND
SHOUTING CONTINUES

38:04.320 --> 38:05.360
Kafir.

38:10.840 --> 38:14.280
"I will cast terror into the hearts
of those who disbelieve.

38:14.320 --> 38:16.279
"Therefore, strike off their heads

38:16.280 --> 38:18.480
"and strike off every
fingertip of them."

38:21.800 --> 38:58.560
HE SCREAMS

39:16.280 --> 39:18.760
RADIO: 'Suspect vehicle reported
moving into wooded area

39:18.800 --> 39:20.400
'adjacent to A2 near Faversham.'

39:20.440 --> 39:22.720
Come on!
HORN

39:22.760 --> 39:24.760
You want to get in left here.

39:26.640 --> 39:27.640
That's it.

39:36.360 --> 39:38.360
Get out. Go, go.

39:38.400 --> 39:40.600
Bisur'a! Quick! Vite! Vite!

39:40.640 --> 39:41.640
Run!

39:42.960 --> 39:43.960
Run. Run, run!

40:02.160 --> 40:03.560
There. Yeah. Got it.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.720
PHONE RINGS

40:13.760 --> 40:15.759
Arrived. Need urgent assistance.

40:15.760 --> 40:16.760
No blues and twos.

40:23.400 --> 40:24.560
What do you want to do?

40:24.600 --> 40:25.600
Mr Yusuf?

40:33.600 --> 40:35.280
Run. Run!

40:36.920 --> 40:37.920
Police!

40:58.960 --> 40:59.960
Detective!

41:10.960 --> 41:13.119
Shit.

41:13.120 --> 41:14.240
Ah...

41:35.520 --> 41:37.439
Did you see anything?

41:37.440 --> 41:38.800
Bodies in the van?

41:39.880 --> 41:41.000
No.

42:00.120 --> 42:01.120
Alan Wilson?

42:02.840 --> 42:05.720
Did he do it?
He says he was still in the van.

42:05.760 --> 42:07.039
Who let him out?

42:07.040 --> 42:08.959
Presumably, Alan Wilson's killer.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.320
He let them out? Yep.

42:12.760 --> 42:14.600
He let them go.

42:14.640 --> 42:17.039
The killer took photos of the body,

42:17.040 --> 42:20.880
and sent them to
Jamal al Sham and Kali Aziz.

42:21.012 --> 42:22.811
He is YH.

42:22.836 --> 42:25.762
He doesn't know they're dead. No.

42:26.160 --> 42:28.479
The brutality's a warning.

42:28.480 --> 42:29.640
I'll get a tent up.

42:37.560 --> 42:38.960
Armed police!

42:44.920 --> 42:47.160
Clear.

43:09.040 --> 43:10.040
Detective?

43:13.520 --> 43:14.600
Yusuf Hamed.

43:26.240 --> 43:27.280
It's clean.

43:33.000 --> 43:34.279
Hmm.

43:34.280 --> 43:35.600
Why is that?

43:35.640 --> 43:37.400
The rest of the place is a tip.

43:38.520 --> 43:39.919
Smell bleach?

43:39.920 --> 43:41.120
Uh-huh. Yeah.

44:04.680 --> 44:05.680
Hello.

44:12.680 --> 44:13.680
Yeah.

44:21.560 --> 44:22.560
Hold that.

44:32.720 --> 44:33.720
Oh, God.

44:37.320 --> 44:38.320
Let's see.

44:41.880 --> 44:42.880
Another migrant?

44:50.400 --> 44:51.400
Thanks.

45:10.960 --> 45:11.960
Jack?

45:14.360 --> 45:16.000
She's missing a finger.

45:48.440 --> 45:49.880
Stay here, sleep.

45:49.920 --> 45:52.759
There'll be trains from
that station in the morning.

45:52.760 --> 45:54.560
No!

45:54.600 --> 45:56.159
I don't want you with me.

45:56.160 --> 45:57.160
You'll slow me down.

46:57.920 --> 47:00.680
He sat here all night.

47:00.720 --> 47:02.080
He will not speak.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.200
Varkey?

47:07.720 --> 47:08.720
There is no God.

47:10.160 --> 47:11.160
It's all a lie.

47:21.960 --> 47:22.960
Leave me.

47:59.520 --> 48:01.400
There he is. Alan Wilson.

48:02.560 --> 48:04.719
We were looking for Janna.

48:04.720 --> 48:06.000
He murdered Jamal.

48:06.040 --> 48:08.760
Yes, but we're short on the evidence
to prove it.

48:10.280 --> 48:13.320
This is a ledger of money
he collected from his victims.

48:14.960 --> 48:18.199
He left them in the van to die,
but kept giving their families hope

48:18.200 --> 48:20.079
in order to extort
more money from them.

48:20.080 --> 48:22.240
He went rogue.
That's what it looks like.

48:22.280 --> 48:23.880
Where did the money go?

48:23.920 --> 48:25.280
Zakat.

48:25.320 --> 48:26.320
Charity.

48:29.520 --> 48:31.119
"True Faith Academy"?

48:31.120 --> 48:33.000
They take your mind and your money.

49:03.280 --> 49:04.880
Let's go, we have to find him.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.360
Yula, come on, let's go.

49:09.520 --> 49:10.880
Why did you let him hit me?

49:13.360 --> 49:15.240
I'm going.

49:15.280 --> 49:16.480
Are you coming with me?

49:27.600 --> 49:32.400
I'm going.

50:09.920 --> 50:12.359
From Abdul Al Wilson's notebook,

50:12.360 --> 50:15.959
I was able to get into his MemoWire
account and see the history.

50:15.960 --> 50:18.600
The trafficking seems to have been
well established.

50:18.640 --> 50:21.279
And it IS Yusuf Hamed's business.

50:21.280 --> 50:24.120
Wilson was simply exploiting
a desperate situation.

50:24.160 --> 50:27.319
There does seem to be a form
of coded language

50:27.320 --> 50:30.280
that preceded payment
and the arrangements being made.

50:30.320 --> 50:31.439
What was it?

50:31.440 --> 50:34.080
"A friend needs your help.

50:34.120 --> 50:35.160
"They have money."

50:38.080 --> 50:39.720
MESSAGE ALERT

51:03.760 --> 51:04.760
He's confirmed.

51:07.400 --> 51:08.600
I'm going to have him.

51:24.960 --> 51:27.680
Where are your grandfather
and your brother?

51:27.720 --> 51:29.600
They are gone.

51:31.800 --> 51:32.800
I'm sorry.

51:34.360 --> 51:36.040
It's how they are.

51:51.480 --> 51:52.480
Akka!

51:58.400 --> 51:59.400
Sosa!

52:22.560 --> 52:23.760
Her cousin.

52:23.800 --> 52:26.719
She was separated from
Elia and Eapen in the chaos.

52:26.720 --> 52:30.240
She's alive today because of it.
How'd she get here?

52:30.280 --> 52:32.480
Hasn't talked about it.
DOOR BUZZER

52:32.520 --> 52:33.600
Not to me.

52:39.849 --> 52:40.879
Thank you.

52:40.919 --> 52:42.118
No-one ever says that.

52:43.280 --> 52:44.880
They're both under 16?

52:44.920 --> 52:46.119
Yes.

52:46.120 --> 52:47.520
No parents here?

52:47.560 --> 52:50.239
They're cousins.
Akka's parents are dead.

52:50.240 --> 52:52.400
Sosa's are unaccounted for.

52:52.440 --> 52:54.640
They I think
they'll qualify for asylum.

52:56.120 --> 52:58.719
We passed the hat,

52:58.720 --> 53:00.999
bought them a few clothes.

53:01.000 --> 53:02.159
Oh, thank you.

53:02.160 --> 53:03.800
Twice in one day.

53:09.640 --> 53:11.320
Hey, hey, shh, it's OK.

53:11.360 --> 53:13.080
Just got you some clothes.

53:18.440 --> 53:20.320
I'm going to come see you tomorrow.

53:39.560 --> 53:40.960
How did you get out?

53:44.320 --> 53:45.320
There was a man...

53:46.840 --> 53:48.040
..called Mr Yusuf.

53:49.520 --> 53:52.080
HE NERVOUSLY FLICKS
THE LIGHTER

54:01.080 --> 54:07.160
INAUDIBLE

54:08.800 --> 54:09.800
Stand by.

54:18.960 --> 54:19.960
Contact made.

54:29.320 --> 54:30.719
Can't see him.

54:30.720 --> 54:31.720
On my signal.

54:45.160 --> 54:46.960
No...

54:47.000 --> 54:48.000
No!

54:55.760 --> 54:58.759
This is Butler. We need an
ambulance at the market now.

54:58.760 --> 55:01.880
We have a male with a stab wound
to the back and to the chest.

55:18.800 --> 55:21.480
Yusuf Hamed. Male.

55:21.520 --> 55:23.520
41 years old.

55:23.560 --> 55:24.560
British.

56:23.920 --> 56:26.480
It's very important that you don't
use the guest house for a bit.

56:26.520 --> 56:28.080
Don't even come to the house.

56:31.400 --> 56:33.000
Do you think they found her?

56:35.080 --> 56:39.080
He's confident, careful,
and forensically aware.

56:39.120 --> 56:41.199
I'd be very surprised
if he hadn't killed before.

56:41.200 --> 56:43.040
Your sister's carrying my child.

56:43.080 --> 56:45.399
If she was to play happy families
with a junkie,

56:45.400 --> 56:47.400
that's her prerogative.

56:47.440 --> 56:49.600
If they found out that you
were in the area,

56:49.640 --> 56:51.760
we all know how quickly
they jump to conclusions.

56:51.800 --> 56:53.040
What about you, Ellie?

56:53.080 --> 56:54.920
Are you jumping to any conclusions?
