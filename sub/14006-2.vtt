00:00.943 --> 00:02.716
Previously on Damages...

00:03.100 --> 00:05.251
Hewes & associates
called me yesterday.

00:05.293 --> 00:07.345
Once Patty meets you,
there's no turning back.

00:07.399 --> 00:08.421
She'll see what I see.

00:08.438 --> 00:09.607
And she'll own you.

00:09.879 --> 00:11.781
Ms. Hewes.
What are you doing here?

00:11.830 --> 00:14.967
Kiddo, you're the first person
stupid enough to turn me down.

00:15.239 --> 00:17.439
Is there any way
I could still interview?

00:17.505 --> 00:18.536
You're hired.

00:18.592 --> 00:20.762
We are engaging in a battle

00:20.804 --> 00:22.774
with a man who will stop at nothing

00:22.808 --> 00:24.080
to preserve his fortune.

00:24.123 --> 00:26.161
<i>Arthur Frobisher told his employees</i>

00:26.332 --> 00:27.832
<i>to invest in the company</i>

00:27.995 --> 00:29.632
<i>and then sold his own stock.</i>

00:29.681 --> 00:30.920
She's on a mission here,

00:30.967 --> 00:34.035
and she won't stop till you're strung up
in the public square.

00:34.068 --> 00:36.120
Make the call.
I want some leverage.

00:36.176 --> 00:39.366
My boss wanted me
to check up on his investment.

00:39.433 --> 00:41.566
You're my sister.
How do you know Arthur Frobisher?

00:41.608 --> 00:43.962
I catered a function
for him and some businessmen.

00:44.012 --> 00:46.163
Katie, this whole case turns
on one weekend,

00:46.164 --> 00:47.196
and you were there.

00:47.197 --> 00:49.089
You want me to be
a witness against Frobisher?

00:49.371 --> 00:51.389
The new associate's been
talking to Katie connor.

00:51.410 --> 00:52.925
Whatever it takes...

00:52.989 --> 00:54.303
<i>fix this.</i>

00:54.663 --> 00:56.727
I think we have a strong case.

00:57.254 --> 00:59.985
I'd like to take it to a jury
and let them decide

01:00.025 --> 01:02.981
what Mr. Arthur Frobisher owes you.

01:03.051 --> 01:04.709
I say we end this here and now.

01:04.775 --> 01:07.118
I vote to accept the settlement.

01:07.460 --> 01:09.717
How could you have
possibly made such a

01:09.753 --> 01:11.581
catastrophic screw up?

01:11.617 --> 01:12.620
You're fired.

01:12.647 --> 01:13.670
Get out of the car!

01:13.697 --> 01:15.151
My future sister-in-law

01:15.178 --> 01:18.532
is a potential witness in
the biggest case in Patty's career.

01:18.630 --> 01:20.897
You think Patty hired
you just to get to Katie?

01:20.948 --> 01:23.360
Did she only hire me
to deliver her witness?

01:23.412 --> 01:25.209
There's no way she knew
about your friend.

01:25.393 --> 01:26.766
Saffron!

01:31.756 --> 01:32.857
Call Patty.

01:33.748 --> 01:35.027
You know what this means?

01:35.049 --> 01:36.878
If Katie can help the case, then

01:37.006 --> 01:38.208
we're doing the right thing.

01:38.245 --> 01:41.139
If Frobisher thought this would
shut her up, it's done the opposite.

01:41.436 --> 01:42.516
What's this?

01:42.535 --> 01:43.914
A souvenir for Patty.

01:44.342 --> 01:46.828
Maybe one of these days
I'll stop being impressed.

01:48.401 --> 01:49.723
Ellen figures out

01:49.919 --> 01:53.047
why you hired her, and you still
get her to deliver the witness.

01:53.255 --> 01:54.352
I like Ellen.

01:55.529 --> 01:57.706
I think she's going
to have a brilliant future.

Ortiz! You better get in here.

03:02.049 --> 03:03.055
Hey, boss, it's Williams.

03:03.074 --> 03:04.079
We got a body.

03:09.622 --> 03:11.047
And a murder weapon.

03:15.163 --> 03:16.410
Hey, baby...

03:16.871 --> 03:19.867
All right, nobody sing
because we all know...

03:19.885 --> 03:21.637
Ellen hates singing!

03:21.669 --> 03:23.311
Whatever, whatever.

03:24.377 --> 03:25.879
But I love Fudgie the Whale.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.134
Think a wish.

03:29.956 --> 03:32.563
This next one is from
your favorite aunt and uncle.

03:32.586 --> 03:34.379
Didn't anybody read the invitation?

03:34.409 --> 03:36.243
Yeah, yeah, you
and your "no gift" bullshit.

03:36.261 --> 03:37.884
- Does anybody want anything?
- Ellen...

03:37.885 --> 03:38.906
- I'm okay.
- ...David,

03:39.280 --> 03:40.676
we know you two are real busy.

03:40.761 --> 03:42.964
A young lawyer
with a fantastic new job

03:43.020 --> 03:45.323
and a dreamy doctor fiancé.

03:45.709 --> 03:46.881
Oh, the dreamiest.

03:46.924 --> 03:48.082
You both work

03:48.230 --> 03:49.240
so much,

03:49.304 --> 03:50.726
you don't even have time to eat,

03:50.904 --> 03:53.892
plus you're saving your
money to move into Manhattan.

03:53.917 --> 03:55.369
You got us an apartment?

03:55.406 --> 03:57.666
So until Katie's
restaurant opens...

03:58.548 --> 04:00.979
Aw, dinner for two
at the Olive Garden.

04:01.007 --> 04:03.182
When you're there, you're family.

04:04.034 --> 04:05.097
Thank you, Uncle Fran.

04:05.139 --> 04:06.317
Thank you.

04:07.035 --> 04:08.745
Thanks, Aunt Barb, so much.

04:08.832 --> 04:10.089
Thanks to comming.

04:17.487 --> 04:20.087
Frobisher's lawyer
calls three times a day.

04:20.113 --> 04:21.661
He's just trying to intimidate you.

04:21.747 --> 04:24.428
They just want you to sign
the confidentiality agreement.

04:24.504 --> 04:26.011
I hate these people.

04:26.065 --> 04:27.342
When you see Patty tomorrow,

04:27.366 --> 04:29.082
she'll tell you how to handle them.

04:29.339 --> 04:31.070
Every time I close my eyes,

04:31.344 --> 04:32.756
I see Saffron dead

04:32.785 --> 04:34.156
on my kitchen floor.

04:35.641 --> 04:37.442
Patty thinks
Frobisher's an asshole, too.

04:37.472 --> 04:40.355
The guy bankrupted
5,000 of his employees.

04:40.543 --> 04:43.587
I don't even care if I never step
foot in my restaurant again.

04:43.751 --> 04:46.146
Katie, we'll get through this.
Okay?

04:46.210 --> 04:47.358
The worst is over.

04:47.916 --> 04:49.868
El, your Mom wants you
to open up her present.

04:49.913 --> 04:50.972
Okay.

04:51.650 --> 04:52.968
- You guys okay?
- Wait.

04:53.216 --> 04:54.636
While I got you both here.

04:56.814 --> 04:58.599
Happy birthday, Ellen.

04:59.505 --> 05:02.123
It's a little kitsch
to add to your collection

05:02.189 --> 05:03.235
for your new apartment.

05:03.278 --> 05:05.463
Thanks, honey, you're sweet.

05:11.496 --> 05:12.600
A bookend's!

05:14.224 --> 05:15.716
- You like?
- Beautiful.

05:15.747 --> 05:16.905
It's beautiful.

<i>Oh, my gosh, unreal.</i>

06:29.171 --> 06:31.021
Okay, Patty, I get it, I get it.

06:31.467 --> 06:33.393
I don't need to know what I
don't need to know.

06:33.413 --> 06:34.912
Tom, Tom, Tom.

06:36.058 --> 06:38.106
Your advance
for the next two weeks.

06:38.647 --> 06:40.558
So consider me on call.

06:40.716 --> 06:43.019
I'll just... wait around
to hear from you.

06:45.931 --> 06:47.791
Good luck
with the Frobisher clients.

06:48.286 --> 06:50.448
Has Ellen tried to
contact you again?

06:50.567 --> 06:51.605
No.

06:52.042 --> 06:53.776
I like that she trusts you.

06:54.842 --> 06:56.245
Run into her again.

06:57.043 --> 06:58.285
Talk to her.

06:58.442 --> 06:59.463
Where?

07:00.700 --> 07:01.856
The office.

07:02.987 --> 07:05.374
I thought you want everyone
to think I was fired.

07:05.496 --> 07:07.488
All the more reason to stop by.

07:08.196 --> 07:09.702
Clear out your stuff,

07:10.081 --> 07:11.626
work the relationship.

07:23.108 --> 07:24.128
Page Six.

07:24.172 --> 07:25.311
This morning's paper.

07:27.955 --> 07:29.711
I went shopping yesterday, Arthur.

07:29.804 --> 07:30.917
It's in there today.

07:34.433 --> 07:35.499
No, thanks.

07:38.590 --> 07:40.940
They're saying
I spent $20,000 on shoes

07:40.967 --> 07:43.582
while your former employees
are lined up for food stamps.

07:43.625 --> 07:44.917
Yeah, well, you know,

07:45.973 --> 07:48.353
you can't pay attention
to this crap, Holly.

07:48.388 --> 07:50.319
I spent $2,000 and it
was for the kids.

07:51.243 --> 07:53.892
All right, all right, I'll have
Ray Fiske make a call,

07:53.922 --> 07:55.836
see if we can get
them to print a retraction.

07:55.874 --> 07:58.154
Then some shithead
photographer chased us

07:58.301 --> 07:59.517
and hit my car,

08:00.468 --> 08:01.623
but I can't go to the police

08:01.647 --> 08:03.399
because that would just
bring more press.

08:04.168 --> 08:06.093
Bethie's friends won't come over.

08:07.082 --> 08:09.848
Their parents won't let them.
Reporters are following her to school.

08:09.866 --> 08:11.580
I know, I know, she told me.

08:12.359 --> 08:14.100
This is not a childhood, Arthur.

08:16.562 --> 08:18.627
You promised me that
all of this would be over

08:18.655 --> 08:20.120
after the government trial.

08:20.681 --> 08:23.000
Look, there are things
that are beyond my control.

08:23.026 --> 08:24.074
You know that.

08:24.114 --> 08:26.623
I am trying to settle this case.

08:26.678 --> 08:27.955
Try harder.

08:31.273 --> 08:32.597
I offered them

08:33.160 --> 08:36.432
$100 million
for something I didn't do.

08:36.486 --> 08:37.664
Offer them more.

08:38.177 --> 08:39.523
Give them whatever they want.

08:39.575 --> 08:40.635
Okay.

08:41.157 --> 08:42.260
How much?

08:42.489 --> 08:44.134
One billion? Two billion?

08:44.854 --> 08:46.583
I'll tell you what.
Why don't I give you

08:46.610 --> 08:48.183
the pen and you write the check?

08:48.253 --> 08:49.779
You promised me, Arthur.

08:50.432 --> 08:51.777
Don't look at me like that.

08:54.645 --> 08:55.670
Uh...

08:56.689 --> 08:58.775
Thank you, Ricky,
it looks fantastic.

08:59.011 --> 09:01.606
I'll tell you what. Why don't you
eat it, though, all right?

09:02.725 --> 09:04.671
No, actually, come here,
come here, come here.

09:04.964 --> 09:05.989
You know what?

09:06.156 --> 09:07.322
Just pick the...

09:07.740 --> 09:10.033
peppers out of this thing
and give it to the dogs.

09:10.057 --> 09:11.086
They'll love it.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.523
We have the Met gala on Sunday
and I don't want to late, so

09:16.554 --> 09:17.851
be sure you're home from golf.

09:17.888 --> 09:21.317
I'm doing everything I can
to make this go away.

09:21.380 --> 09:23.357
Tuesday night is the
Helping Hands auction.

09:23.381 --> 09:24.572
I'm fine to go to that alone.

09:24.604 --> 09:25.960
Holly, come on, don't do that.

09:25.989 --> 09:28.141
And we have to make a
decision about the Aspen house.

09:28.142 --> 09:29.142
Are we going to keep building

09:29.143 --> 09:30.582
- or are we going to sell it?
- Please.

09:30.583 --> 09:32.163
What, Arthur? I heard you.

09:32.458 --> 09:34.094
You're doing all that you can.

09:35.225 --> 09:36.578
What do you want me to say?

09:42.576 --> 09:43.674
Nothing.

09:46.077 --> 09:48.317
These are for Ms. Hewes' meeting
with Kathryn Connor.

09:49.851 --> 09:52.148
- Well, good morning.
- Morning.

09:52.218 --> 09:54.259
Your ears must have
been ringing last night.

09:54.389 --> 09:56.530
- Why is that?
- I was talking about you.

09:56.878 --> 09:57.929
Really.

10:00.041 --> 10:01.950
Aren't you going to
ask what I was saying?

10:02.234 --> 10:04.622
Well, I figured you'd tell me
if you wanted me to know.

10:04.665 --> 10:06.177
All good things, Ellen,

10:06.217 --> 10:07.694
- all good things.
- Thank you.

10:07.787 --> 10:09.481
There's a client
meeting in ten minutes.

10:09.588 --> 10:10.653
Come sit in.

10:13.570 --> 10:14.859
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:14.911 --> 10:15.933
Another week?

10:15.956 --> 10:17.583
What the hell are we talking about?

10:17.865 --> 10:21.399
Frobisher offered us
$100 million to settle

10:21.866 --> 10:23.477
and we voted to accept it.

10:23.536 --> 10:25.484
Nothing has been signed yet,
Mr. Poplar.

10:25.540 --> 10:27.048
But it was a done deal.

10:27.088 --> 10:28.093
Larry,

10:28.117 --> 10:30.910
Ms. Hewes thinks this witness can
prove Frobisher's guilt.

10:30.943 --> 10:32.525
I don't want to lose that money.

10:32.573 --> 10:34.484
Frobisher is praying
that you settle.

10:34.503 --> 10:35.796
The money's going nowhere.

10:35.980 --> 10:37.554
So what would you like from us?

10:38.209 --> 10:39.426
Time, Karen.

10:39.707 --> 10:41.761
This new witness was in Florida

10:41.792 --> 10:43.618
the same weekend
as Arthur Frobisher.

10:44.267 --> 10:45.684
If you give us another week,

10:45.714 --> 10:47.585
we can find out
what this witness knows,

10:47.628 --> 10:49.635
and I believe it
will give us leverage.

10:49.823 --> 10:50.925
Ms. Hewes,

10:50.978 --> 10:53.474
you really think
this could be the smoking gun?

10:55.532 --> 10:57.851
I'd like the opportunity
to find out.

11:13.430 --> 11:16.382
Sorry to be a stickler
for the rules, Art, but...

11:16.452 --> 11:20.356
Uncle Sam has designated
this environment smoke-free.

11:27.660 --> 11:30.143
I... called you

11:30.607 --> 11:33.211
because our young friend
Katie Connor

11:34.198 --> 11:36.786
hasn't been to the restaurant
in a week

11:37.105 --> 11:39.234
nor has she signed
the new paperwork,

11:39.714 --> 11:41.428
which could spell disaster.

11:46.724 --> 11:48.596
Okay, Art,

11:50.038 --> 11:51.978
what do you want to talk about?

11:53.351 --> 11:55.734
What happens if she leaves me?

11:56.428 --> 11:57.566
I beg your pardon?

11:58.503 --> 11:59.514
Holly.

12:01.132 --> 12:02.880
Bottom line it for me, will you?

12:04.289 --> 12:06.010
Well, this is New York State, Art.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.750
You'll write her a check

12:08.001 --> 12:09.131
for half of everything.

12:10.827 --> 12:12.086
And the kids?

12:12.666 --> 12:13.768
Well...

12:14.259 --> 12:18.593
she's the sympathetic mother
who runs three children's charities...

12:18.628 --> 12:19.837
Which I founded...

12:19.874 --> 12:22.323
... and you're a controversial
father involved

12:22.355 --> 12:25.062
in a very public litigation
to defend your reputation.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.691
You need her, Art,

12:28.542 --> 12:29.868
now more than ever.

12:30.097 --> 12:32.420
She's the one person
who's remained loyal to you.

12:33.585 --> 12:34.907
If she leaves now,

12:36.333 --> 12:38.228
we'll take a beating in the press.

12:39.098 --> 12:40.855
All right, all right, let me ask...

12:42.044 --> 12:43.875
And if we lose this, this

12:44.260 --> 12:46.581
Katie Connor, what happens?

12:48.553 --> 12:50.465
If she doesn't sign the paperwork,

12:51.512 --> 12:55.280
it becomes a hell of a lot harder
to destroy her credibility.

12:57.308 --> 12:59.400
Look, Art...

13:01.711 --> 13:04.778
the law is on our side.

13:05.741 --> 13:07.168
The evidence

13:08.048 --> 13:09.134
is on our side.

13:09.158 --> 13:11.330
On paper, this case

13:12.054 --> 13:14.543
is tighter than a bull's ass
on fight night.

13:16.682 --> 13:19.777
But if Patty Hewes gets
that girl in front of a jury...

13:21.861 --> 13:23.319
all bets are off.

13:28.894 --> 13:31.375
Hey. I'm here to see Patty Hewes.

13:33.249 --> 13:34.909
Welcome to Hewes & Associates.

13:35.094 --> 13:36.548
Hey!

13:36.597 --> 13:38.469
- How you feeling?
- Nervous.

13:38.507 --> 13:41.598
Come on back. Patty's running a few
minutes late. I'll show you my office.

13:41.641 --> 13:43.069
This place is incredible.

13:43.115 --> 13:44.191
I know.

13:44.779 --> 13:47.476
So, how many people
are going to be in there?

13:47.600 --> 13:50.021
Just you, me and Patty.
We'll go through your

13:50.083 --> 13:52.005
Florida timeline and
make sure you're hitting

13:52.033 --> 13:53.777
all the details about that weekend.

13:53.834 --> 13:56.706
I saw him two or three times
that weekend.

13:56.783 --> 13:59.116
That's fine.
Patty just wants to see if

13:59.174 --> 14:02.331
anything you can remember will
contradict Frobisher's testimony.

14:02.362 --> 14:03.745
So, I can read it off my notes?

14:03.854 --> 14:05.751
Of course. It's not a test.

14:06.120 --> 14:07.136
I'm in here.

14:07.159 --> 14:08.392
- Another thing?
- Yeah?

14:08.455 --> 14:09.701
- You look great.
- Thanks.

14:09.730 --> 14:12.151
I totally forgot to call you
to ask you what to wear.

14:12.209 --> 14:13.951
Ellen, Felicia wants
to see the two of us.

14:13.952 --> 14:14.977
Okay.

14:15.220 --> 14:16.388
Now.

14:17.405 --> 14:18.688
Hang in there. I'll be back.

14:18.715 --> 14:19.794
Sure.

14:21.154 --> 14:22.841
We've bought ourselves more time.

14:23.183 --> 14:25.377
The clients have agreed
to give us another week.

14:25.702 --> 14:28.049
Patty wants us to start
prepping their testimonies,

14:28.080 --> 14:29.521
getting them to tell their stories.

14:29.555 --> 14:31.153
Why go poking at wounds now?

14:31.247 --> 14:33.080
It'll make them want
to settle even sooner.

14:34.614 --> 14:35.677
Really?

14:36.284 --> 14:37.586
Anyone else want to weigh in?

14:39.828 --> 14:40.878
Ellen?

14:41.938 --> 14:43.692
Um... I'm not sure.

14:43.962 --> 14:45.105
Not sure what?

14:47.136 --> 14:48.902
I grew up with people like this.

14:49.062 --> 14:51.719
A $100 million settlement
sounds like a gold mine to them,

14:51.749 --> 14:53.551
and it's softening their resolve.

14:53.665 --> 14:55.859
If you want them to turn it down,
I think you're right to remind

14:55.860 --> 14:58.309
them what they've been through,
stir up their emotion.

15:03.918 --> 15:05.409
I could see the value in that.

15:05.482 --> 15:06.494
Good.

15:06.528 --> 15:08.640
Divide them up.
Each of you take a department.

15:09.104 --> 15:10.979
Ellen, shadow Andrew.
See how we do it.

15:12.226 --> 15:13.288
Now?

15:13.368 --> 15:15.705
The car's waiting downstairs
to take you to Newark.

15:17.623 --> 15:18.763
Is Patty leaving?

15:18.787 --> 15:20.244
No, no, she's still
meeting with you.

15:20.245 --> 15:21.624
But I thought you
were going to be there.

15:21.625 --> 15:24.446
Patty'll take care of you. Could
you look after Ms. Connor, please?

15:24.447 --> 15:25.447
You'll be great.

15:25.448 --> 15:26.682
I'll call you when we're done.

15:31.007 --> 15:32.527
You're a smart girl, Ellen,

15:32.756 --> 15:34.124
but you better watch your ass.

15:34.664 --> 15:35.705
What?

15:35.743 --> 15:37.086
Tom Shayes is gone.

15:37.555 --> 15:40.375
When it came time to recruit,
we each backed our own horse.

15:40.406 --> 15:41.945
Your boy Tom bet on you.

15:42.440 --> 15:44.903
He was the only one who stood
to gain when you got the job.

15:45.328 --> 15:46.617
What are you trying to tell me?

15:47.559 --> 15:48.872
I'm trying to tell you,

15:48.908 --> 15:51.361
you should think twice
before you shoot your mouth off.

15:51.450 --> 15:52.941
Andrew, Patty called on me.

15:53.133 --> 15:54.154
Yeah?

15:54.318 --> 15:56.315
You think Craig and Felicia
care about that?

15:57.314 --> 16:00.015
You don't show up
your fellow associates, Ellen.

16:01.122 --> 16:03.726
The only way you're going to
make it here is with our support.

16:04.250 --> 16:06.068
I was just answering a question.

16:06.354 --> 16:07.602
I have no agenda.

16:07.630 --> 16:09.241
Well, maybe you
better get one quick.

16:10.855 --> 16:13.858
You're in Patty's good graces now
because your friend's a witness,

16:13.918 --> 16:15.529
but that can change on a dime.

16:25.901 --> 16:27.994
Olio Santo from California?

16:28.067 --> 16:29.894
Unfiltered from Tuscany?

16:29.999 --> 16:32.298
I mean, it's damn near
impossible to decide.

16:32.534 --> 16:35.644
The raging olive oil debate
between Giada De Laurentiis

16:35.667 --> 16:36.738
and the Barefoot Contessa.

16:37.323 --> 16:38.425
Exactly.

16:38.679 --> 16:40.142
Last night's Food Network.

16:40.993 --> 16:42.091
So, what is better...

16:42.143 --> 16:44.634
virgin or extra virgin,
or is it all just

16:44.670 --> 16:45.876
marketing bullshit?

16:45.929 --> 16:47.261
It's about acidity.

16:47.286 --> 16:48.741
An American or Italian?

16:49.227 --> 16:52.028
I love a little family-owned
vineyard in Greece.

16:52.503 --> 16:54.122
I'll write down their
website for you.

16:54.147 --> 16:56.235
- Oh, good.
- I mean, it's expensive, but...

16:56.466 --> 16:58.226
nothing like Manhattan, though.

16:58.432 --> 17:00.936
Ellen was checking out this
apartment on 91st and Riverside,

17:00.956 --> 17:02.902
and I asked her to get some
stuff for a salad.

17:02.962 --> 17:05.896
Eight bucks for an organic tomato.
Can you believe that?

17:07.496 --> 17:09.415
Great, Katie. Thanks.

17:10.323 --> 17:11.676
Thanks for coming by.

17:11.717 --> 17:12.948
It was nice to meet you.

17:13.467 --> 17:14.550
We're finished?

17:14.760 --> 17:15.799
Why?

17:16.148 --> 17:17.584
Something else you want to tell me?

17:17.617 --> 17:21.037
No, no. I-I... I just thought that we
were going to look over the timeline.

17:21.070 --> 17:22.458
Oh, I really don't see the point.

17:22.483 --> 17:23.693
Although,

17:24.363 --> 17:25.867
I did have one question.

17:27.634 --> 17:28.970
How old were you?

17:29.900 --> 17:30.934
I'm sorry?

17:31.210 --> 17:32.576
I had just turned six.

17:33.321 --> 17:34.356
When what?

17:34.740 --> 17:36.724
When I realized I was a good liar.

17:38.043 --> 17:39.262
How old were you?

17:40.704 --> 17:43.362
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:43.427 --> 17:44.573
Your timeline?

17:45.375 --> 17:46.481
I don't buy it.

17:47.891 --> 17:50.368
So, right now you're going
to do one of two things...

17:50.464 --> 17:52.728
turn around and get
the hell out of my office,

17:52.785 --> 17:53.885
or tell me the truth.

17:53.946 --> 17:55.538
The truth?
Ms. Hewes, I'm not lying...

17:55.568 --> 17:56.582
Katie, don't, don't.

17:56.617 --> 17:58.616
It's me and you now.
Ellen isn't here.

17:59.118 --> 18:00.269
I don't understand.

18:00.294 --> 18:01.654
I want the straight story,

18:01.672 --> 18:03.636
and until you tell me,
you're worthless to me.

18:03.658 --> 18:05.076
I don't give a shit about you.

18:05.350 --> 18:06.669
Wait. Ms. Hewes, please. I...

18:06.707 --> 18:08.278
What aren't you telling me?

18:08.459 --> 18:10.994
Nothing! I put everything
I know down here.

18:11.859 --> 18:14.123
They want me to sign
a new confidentiality agreement.

18:14.148 --> 18:16.639
- Yeah, I read it. It's very thorough.
- Well, what should I do?

18:16.640 --> 18:17.674
Do whatever you want to.

18:18.351 --> 18:19.373
Sign it.

18:20.503 --> 18:22.434
These people are going
to come after me again!

18:22.457 --> 18:24.294
I thought that you were going
to protect me.

18:24.322 --> 18:25.805
Until you stop lying,

18:25.862 --> 18:28.679
you're not my witness,
and you're not my problem.

18:30.296 --> 18:32.653
Please, Ms. Hewes. Wait.

18:35.363 --> 18:37.650
<i>Hewes & Associates.
Can I help you?</i>

18:41.672 --> 18:42.716
<i>We were told the girl</i>

18:42.746 --> 18:44.256
lives here with her fiancé.

18:44.501 --> 18:45.717
Have you questioned her?

18:45.748 --> 18:46.767
Not yet.

18:46.952 --> 18:48.950
The front door was
chained, but not locked.

18:48.985 --> 18:50.711
At approximately 9:15 a. m.,

18:50.746 --> 18:52.409
we force entry, and we find this.

18:52.962 --> 18:54.598
The stereo's still there, TV.

18:55.340 --> 18:56.595
So is the computer.

18:57.400 --> 18:58.689
And most telling of all...

18:58.777 --> 19:00.217
???????

19:00.370 --> 19:03.240
You come to loot a place, you
don't leave something like that behind.

19:04.241 --> 19:05.308
So, it wasn't a robbery.

19:06.300 --> 19:07.300
Watch yourself, Lieu.

19:14.075 --> 19:15.536
He was a good-looking kid.

19:21.639 --> 19:22.639
So, what do you think?

19:23.284 --> 19:24.846
She caught him screwing around?

19:25.696 --> 19:28.275
<i>I don't know what you're talking about.
You got to slow down.</i>

19:28.319 --> 19:29.439
She's crazy!

19:29.572 --> 19:30.623
Who?

19:30.654 --> 19:32.945
Patty! She-She kicked me out
of her office!

19:32.973 --> 19:36.082
She told me to sign the
confidentiality agreement.

19:36.736 --> 19:37.743
I don't understand.

19:37.767 --> 19:39.097
<i>- I don't, either!
- Ellen?</i>

19:39.119 --> 19:40.861
She's accusing me of lying, Ellen.

19:40.950 --> 19:42.639
<i>- About what?
- Everything!</i>

19:42.695 --> 19:44.977
You read what I wrote.
I'm not lying.

19:45.027 --> 19:46.502
<i>Of course you're not lying.</i>

19:46.549 --> 19:48.322
<i>Well, then tell that to your boss.</i>

19:48.365 --> 19:50.093
You're the one
who made me go in there.

19:50.661 --> 19:53.168
Look, what the hell
am I supposed to do now?

19:53.461 --> 19:55.141
Katie, just calm down.

19:55.159 --> 19:56.175
Go back to the apartment.

19:56.207 --> 19:57.590
I'll be there as soon as I can.

19:57.771 --> 19:58.773
Okay?

20:19.129 --> 20:20.277
Mr. Frobisher,

20:21.062 --> 20:23.071
the girl just met with Patty Hewes.

20:24.521 --> 20:26.908
Ray Fiske wouldn't want me
talking with you, but...

20:27.269 --> 20:29.869
I can't believe our hands
are just tied here.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.280
You gave her a restaurant,
Mr. Frobisher.

20:33.795 --> 20:35.109
What can we do

20:35.307 --> 20:36.554
to keep her quiet?

20:38.471 --> 20:39.542
Offer more money.

20:39.714 --> 20:40.806
No, you can't do that.

20:40.837 --> 20:43.002
The Judge finds out,
I could get nailed for

20:43.088 --> 20:44.361
witness tampering.

20:45.828 --> 20:46.848
Well,

20:46.902 --> 20:48.086
there's always a solution.

20:50.963 --> 20:52.123
What kind of solution?

20:52.784 --> 20:53.809
A permanent one.

20:55.785 --> 20:57.699
What? Oh, God, no.

20:58.892 --> 21:01.674
What, you think that I would...?
It wouldn't get back to you.

21:04.141 --> 21:07.351
Oh, we're-we're talking about
a human life here.

21:07.959 --> 21:09.448
Sh-She's an innocent girl.

21:09.473 --> 21:10.819
She didn't do anything.

21:11.237 --> 21:13.738
She was just in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

21:14.885 --> 21:16.229
Sometimes that's enough.

21:21.528 --> 21:22.632
You're serious, aren't you?

21:22.654 --> 21:23.845
You're actually suggesting...

21:23.867 --> 21:25.105
Look, Mr. Frobisher,

21:25.811 --> 21:28.310
you're insulated,
you have resources.

21:29.491 --> 21:31.454
This kind of thing
is simpler than you think.

21:38.757 --> 21:40.212
So, how's that work?

21:41.378 --> 21:42.952
You... know a guy?
You make a call?

21:43.000 --> 21:44.392
It's simpler than you think.

21:49.381 --> 21:50.989
Yeah, of course it is.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.080
You become powerful enough,

21:55.133 --> 21:58.418
eventually, every option gets
presented to you, doesn't it?

21:58.474 --> 21:59.554
Yes, sir.

21:59.585 --> 22:01.156
One day, you're living your life.

22:01.192 --> 22:03.361
The next thing you know,
some man shows up

22:03.390 --> 22:05.976
on your doorstep and offers you the

22:06.082 --> 22:07.634
ultimate decision.

22:08.566 --> 22:10.266
That's all it is, Mr. Frobisher...

22:10.601 --> 22:12.438
just another decision.

22:15.905 --> 22:17.644
No. No.

22:18.809 --> 22:21.377
You go down that road, and then,

22:22.030 --> 22:23.612
you know, who are you?

22:26.893 --> 22:28.758
I mean, there's no going back.

22:30.268 --> 22:31.661
No, no, no.

22:32.613 --> 22:34.216
Think about your family, Mr. Frobisher.

22:34.217 --> 22:37.550
Don't tell me what this case is going to
end with someone's life being destroyed.

22:39.255 --> 22:40.596
Why should it be yours?

22:59.858 --> 23:01.153
You get what you need?

23:01.819 --> 23:02.858
Yup.

23:03.620 --> 23:05.832
From the Palm Beach County P.D.

23:06.135 --> 23:08.765
Issued the morning
of the Frobisher event.

23:09.008 --> 23:10.767
Katie's hiding details.

23:10.797 --> 23:12.384
She left it off her timeline.

23:13.062 --> 23:15.499
A traffic ticket
seems pretty insignificant.

23:15.581 --> 23:17.571
Her supervisor's kitchen report

23:17.825 --> 23:19.351
says she was right on time.

23:19.515 --> 23:21.630
So, she managed to show up
for work ten minutes

23:21.659 --> 23:24.323
before she was pulled over for
running a red light?

23:24.935 --> 23:26.102
Find out more.

23:26.798 --> 23:29.682
Fiske is making his move,
trying to ruin her credibility.

23:29.705 --> 23:31.297
There's something
in this girl's past.

23:31.319 --> 23:32.445
All right, I'm on it.

23:32.707 --> 23:34.263
Get me everything you can.

23:34.310 --> 23:36.066
Boyfriends, jobs,

23:36.098 --> 23:37.260
- vices.
- Yeah.

23:37.334 --> 23:40.987
I want to know why she was late
for the biggest day of her career.

23:41.985 --> 23:44.010
You think Ellen knows the truth?

23:44.206 --> 23:45.762
Uh, it's too soon to tell.

23:46.645 --> 23:47.672
Anything else?

23:48.612 --> 23:51.095
Yeah, here's the Ellen
information we talked about.

23:51.320 --> 23:53.029
Are you sure you
really want to do this?

23:54.298 --> 23:55.325
Make it happen.

24:24.017 --> 24:25.773
Go long, go long.

24:52.664 --> 24:54.528
Katie. I'm just grabbing my shit.

24:54.568 --> 24:55.685
Where have you been?

24:55.719 --> 24:57.906
- Thinking.
- Why didn't you call me back?

24:58.600 --> 25:00.222
Katie, slow down.

25:01.320 --> 25:02.802
Tell me exactly what happened.

25:02.891 --> 25:03.916
Ask her.

25:04.058 --> 25:05.586
I tried. She didn't call me back.

25:05.647 --> 25:07.511
Ellen, I already told you,

25:07.650 --> 25:09.605
she's crazy.
She thinks I'm lying.

25:09.625 --> 25:10.689
About what?

25:10.748 --> 25:12.249
I don't know. I don't...

25:12.361 --> 25:14.648
I don't know what shd doing.
It doesn't make any sense.

25:14.688 --> 25:16.496
I don't think
she wants you to know.

25:17.240 --> 25:18.247
Why not?

25:18.278 --> 25:20.337
Because ten minutes
before my meeting with her,

25:20.372 --> 25:23.264
she sent you away.
You think that's a coincidence?

25:23.466 --> 25:24.472
Come with me tomorrow.

25:24.493 --> 25:25.973
- We'll go in there together.
- We'll both talk to her.

25:25.974 --> 25:27.657
I'm not going back there.

25:27.697 --> 25:28.705
Where are you going?

25:28.728 --> 25:30.608
Look, I have been
living with you for a week.

25:30.634 --> 25:32.479
This has gone on for long enough.

25:33.311 --> 25:34.942
- Katie.
- Ellen,

25:35.018 --> 25:37.654
I've got to get home.
I have got a life to live.

25:38.119 --> 25:40.800
And I don't know anything
about Frobisher anyway.

25:59.460 --> 26:00.925
Take it easy.

26:12.256 --> 26:14.143
- Get off.
- What?

26:45.321 --> 26:46.321
Hello?

26:46.596 --> 26:47.712
Do it.

26:48.071 --> 26:49.246
Yes, sir.

26:55.182 --> 26:56.663
Oh, shit.

27:00.035 --> 27:01.666
That was intense.

27:14.087 --> 27:16.275
Patty appreciates your involvement.

27:16.427 --> 27:17.513
What's the girl's name?

27:17.907 --> 27:19.778
Ellen Parsons.

27:20.081 --> 27:21.349
Do you have what we need?

27:21.872 --> 27:22.966
Yeah.

27:25.726 --> 27:27.190
Here's everything.

27:28.427 --> 27:29.575
The fiancé?

27:29.834 --> 27:30.964
He's in there, too.

27:35.299 --> 27:36.835
My associates

27:37.450 --> 27:38.914
will look into it.

27:39.809 --> 27:41.000
Thank you.

27:41.709 --> 27:44.215
Nothing too excessive.

27:44.261 --> 27:46.059
Patty's come to me before.

27:46.433 --> 27:47.654
Trust me.

27:47.965 --> 27:49.567
I know how she wants it done.

28:02.178 --> 28:05.137
Don't hover in the door.
I hate that.

28:07.126 --> 28:08.206
What happened with Katie?

28:18.706 --> 28:20.523
I spoke to her, Ms. Hewes.

28:21.090 --> 28:22.627
I don't believe she's lying.

28:23.083 --> 28:24.552
Really? Why is that?

28:25.900 --> 28:27.679
Because she has no reason to.

28:29.452 --> 28:30.920
Don't be stupid, Ellen.

28:31.848 --> 28:33.610
Everyone's hiding something.

28:33.859 --> 28:35.016
Really?

28:36.220 --> 28:37.675
So what are you hiding?

28:40.239 --> 28:41.716
I beg your pardon?

28:42.837 --> 28:45.282
You didn't need me
to meet with the clients yesterday.

28:45.647 --> 28:47.693
You just wanted me out
of the office, didn't you?

28:47.812 --> 28:48.865
Yes.

28:51.325 --> 28:52.550
So you lied to me?

28:53.880 --> 28:55.206
What's your point?

28:57.322 --> 28:58.549
Why would you do that?

28:58.698 --> 29:00.424
You already answered
your own question.

29:00.454 --> 29:02.427
I wanted to meet with Katie alone.

29:02.863 --> 29:04.220
So you...?

29:04.270 --> 29:05.953
I manipulated you, yes.

29:07.088 --> 29:08.729
Well, I don't like
being manipulated.

29:10.019 --> 29:11.288
Duly noted.

29:13.170 --> 29:14.252
Anything else?

29:14.472 --> 29:15.559
Yeah.

29:16.018 --> 29:17.831
You promised to protect Katie.

29:18.683 --> 29:20.926
Now she's totally confused.
She has no idea what to do.

29:20.945 --> 29:24.415
I have a temper, too, Ellen,
but I've learned when to use it.

29:42.681 --> 29:43.717
You were right.

29:44.589 --> 29:45.616
She's using me.

29:45.636 --> 29:47.140
Of course she's using you, Ellen.

29:47.302 --> 29:49.914
Patty Hewes needs people
who are driven.

29:50.207 --> 29:52.330
She's tapping your energy and youth

29:52.384 --> 29:53.680
to further her own agenda.

29:54.950 --> 29:56.051
Which is?

29:56.430 --> 29:59.314
You know what? It's highly unusual
for us to be speaking like this.

29:59.411 --> 30:01.581
You're no longer
a summer associate of mine.

30:02.094 --> 30:03.235
I know.

30:03.838 --> 30:05.819
I offered you a job and
you turned me down.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.924
I didn't know who else talk to,
Mr. Nye.

30:08.946 --> 30:10.165
My advice to you, Ellen,

30:10.208 --> 30:12.264
is stop trying to figure Patty out.

30:13.193 --> 30:14.315
You'll never change her,

30:14.504 --> 30:15.737
but she'll change you.

30:16.635 --> 30:17.637
How?

30:17.669 --> 30:19.474
By giving you access
to how she thinks.

30:20.095 --> 30:21.538
You signed up for this, now

30:21.578 --> 30:23.419
keep your head down
and do the work.

30:24.653 --> 30:26.244
That's why you're there, isn't it?

30:26.421 --> 30:28.260
- Yes.
- Then don't be shortsighted.

30:28.688 --> 30:30.381
Start using her.

30:30.685 --> 30:32.108
Learn everything you can,

30:32.195 --> 30:34.555
then get the hell out
before it's too late.

30:35.094 --> 30:37.179
How exactly will
I know when that is?

30:38.472 --> 30:39.904
That's for another walk.

31:38.291 --> 31:39.338
<i>Patty?</i>

31:39.692 --> 31:41.615
Phil, there's
another credit card charge.

31:41.616 --> 31:44.323
<i>You're going to have to be a little
more specific than that, sweetheart.</i>

31:44.324 --> 31:46.984
$1,200 for a place called Frolic.

31:47.098 --> 31:49.361
That's a gentlemen's club.
I told you about it.

31:49.380 --> 31:52.443
The Singapore clients come to the city,
they love that crap.

31:52.476 --> 31:54.486
<i>I can't drag them out
of the champagne room.</i>

31:54.611 --> 31:57.029
Fine, but this was last week and...

31:57.249 --> 31:58.466
And I was in London.

31:59.763 --> 32:01.560
I'll have a talk with Michael.

32:02.238 --> 32:03.501
What's an outcall?

32:04.818 --> 32:06.345
Patty, I'll have a talk with him.

32:06.623 --> 32:07.716
<i>What is it?</i>

32:08.978 --> 32:11.112
He must've hired strippers.

32:12.505 --> 32:13.851
Hired them out?

32:14.899 --> 32:17.237
You mean our son had
them in our apartment?

32:17.432 --> 32:18.864
<i>Maybe, maybe.</i>

32:18.912 --> 32:22.069
Michael's too smart for this bullshit
and it's getting out of hand.

32:30.018 --> 32:31.258
Jesus Christ!

32:31.289 --> 32:33.564
<i>Patty, I'll handle this.</i>

32:33.593 --> 32:36.521
You know, your plate is full.
Just... I'll take care of it, all right?

32:39.229 --> 32:40.311
<i>Patty?</i>

32:41.554 --> 32:42.580
Yes.

32:42.784 --> 32:44.050
<i>I'll take care of this.</i>

32:45.600 --> 32:46.620
Okay.

32:55.886 --> 32:56.938
Tom.

32:59.766 --> 33:01.562
Told you. Ten years.

33:01.715 --> 33:03.315
One box. One trip.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.141
You didn't deserve this.

33:05.868 --> 33:07.727
Thanks. I'll be okay.

33:08.142 --> 33:10.547
I know I'm only here
because of your support.

33:11.382 --> 33:13.550
Don't believe that for a second.

33:14.098 --> 33:15.145
How're you doing?

33:15.449 --> 33:16.557
You okay?

33:17.129 --> 33:18.210
I am.

33:18.831 --> 33:21.269
- Really.
- Good. I'm glad.

33:22.350 --> 33:25.257
You know that friend
you told me about in the stables?

33:26.148 --> 33:27.429
Did you ever, uh...

33:28.912 --> 33:30.261
you ever tell Patty about her?

33:31.410 --> 33:33.972
I guess we probably
shouldn't discuss business.

33:36.146 --> 33:37.470
Sorry. You're right.

33:37.532 --> 33:38.734
You're absolutely right.

33:39.617 --> 33:40.957
I got a cab waiting for me

33:41.003 --> 33:42.196
downstairs anyway.

33:42.309 --> 33:44.024
You take care of yourself, Ellen.

33:44.933 --> 33:45.946
Thanks, Tom.

33:46.288 --> 33:47.918
All right. I'll see you around.

34:57.629 --> 34:58.792
Hey, are you following me?

34:58.793 --> 35:00.263
I don't know
what you're talking about?

35:00.264 --> 35:01.412
You killed my dog.

35:01.413 --> 35:02.800
You killed my dog!

35:02.844 --> 35:05.008
- I don't you or your dog.
- Get away from me!

35:05.036 --> 35:07.159
- Lady, back off!
- Stay away from me!

35:07.194 --> 35:08.791
I am going to call the police.

35:08.934 --> 35:10.179
Screw you!

35:10.327 --> 35:11.412
Are you okay?

35:12.092 --> 35:14.203
Screw you, asshole!

35:25.655 --> 35:27.819
<i>- You can not going there.
- Excuse me.</i>

35:27.890 --> 35:31.383
Jesus, Mary, and Joe Cocker,
what a fine surprise!

35:31.429 --> 35:33.931
Gentlemen, we do rise
to our feet when a lady enters.

35:34.087 --> 35:35.769
It's signed goddamn it!

35:37.030 --> 35:38.656
That's wonderful news.

35:39.778 --> 35:42.141
It's "all systems go"
for your restaurant.

35:42.166 --> 35:44.185
You got what you want.
Just leave...

35:44.272 --> 35:45.672
me alone!

35:49.685 --> 35:52.321
And to think, for a reasonable fee,

35:52.861 --> 35:55.805
she's available
to cater any occasion.

36:00.148 --> 36:02.368
Come on, goddamn it.

36:04.019 --> 36:05.939
Yeah, where,
where the hell have you been?

36:06.017 --> 36:07.952
Look, I just heard from Ray Fiske.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.381
She signed the papers.
Call it off?

36:10.612 --> 36:13.169
We could do that right?
We can call it off?

36:14.451 --> 36:17.296
No, yeah, but can we call it off?
Answer my... God!

36:18.126 --> 36:19.781
Shit. God...

36:24.367 --> 36:26.098
Hello... Goddamn it!

36:53.595 --> 36:54.751
Oh, my God.

36:56.472 --> 36:58.816
Hi there, I'm Arthur.

36:59.992 --> 37:02.827
I just came by to say hello. Uh...

37:03.922 --> 37:05.178
Oh, wow!

37:06.141 --> 37:08.332
I hear it's full steam ahead
for the opening.

37:08.372 --> 37:09.400
Oh, hey!

37:09.440 --> 37:10.716
My God, I love this.

37:14.832 --> 37:17.122
Mr. Fiske told me that you, uh,

37:17.181 --> 37:18.605
you signed our agreement.

37:19.869 --> 37:22.149
You have no idea how grateful I am.

37:24.429 --> 37:26.010
Lawyers, right?

37:27.807 --> 37:29.878
They make such
a big deal over a little,

37:29.951 --> 37:31.525
a little red tape.

37:34.295 --> 37:35.909
You and I, uh...

37:36.639 --> 37:38.097
If I recall...

37:38.164 --> 37:39.825
God those are beautiful.

37:40.955 --> 37:43.915
We never really spoke when
we were down in Florida, did we?

37:43.959 --> 37:45.579
- No, no, that's right.
- Yeah.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.436
I don't mean to be rude,
but I didn't

37:48.453 --> 37:50.066
even really rember who you were.

37:50.150 --> 37:52.168
- Look, I'm not sure what...
- But your meals!

37:52.230 --> 37:53.633
Oh, my God.

37:53.828 --> 37:55.046
Who could forget that?

37:55.301 --> 37:57.202
Well, it was Kobe beef,

37:57.389 --> 37:59.279
- fingerling...
- Mr. Frobisher, I...

37:59.329 --> 38:00.673
... and just a sprinkle of...

38:02.637 --> 38:04.700
- Saffron.
- Right.

38:06.758 --> 38:08.097
God that was great.

38:08.243 --> 38:09.551
Are gonna have that on the menu?

38:09.578 --> 38:11.549
Look, Mr. Frobisher,
I'm, I'm gonna go now, but

38:11.550 --> 38:13.226
- please you stay as long as...
- No, I'm sorry.

38:13.227 --> 38:14.843
No, please, forgive me.

38:14.844 --> 38:18.699
I just wanted to come by and say,
say thank you.

38:19.983 --> 38:22.243
Isn't life great...

38:22.633 --> 38:25.826
sometimes?
I mean you, you and I, we meet

38:25.827 --> 38:29.175
as total strangers at some
boring luncheon down in

38:29.176 --> 38:31.221
Florida, and the next
thing you know we're,

38:31.222 --> 38:34.221
we're partners, making something
absolutely beautiful.

38:39.471 --> 38:42.023
Our fates are intertwined, Katie.

38:43.192 --> 38:44.634
Isn't that remarkable?

38:48.168 --> 38:50.700
I'm sorry to have bothered you.
Thank you, Katie.

38:55.779 --> 38:57.981
Frobisher showed up at my restaurant.

38:58.039 --> 38:59.812
Why did you call me?

39:01.760 --> 39:03.201
Because you're right.

39:03.786 --> 39:05.383
I lied.

39:06.679 --> 39:08.997
The day I cooked for Frobisher.

39:09.659 --> 39:11.062
So this was,

39:11.841 --> 39:14.062
about June 2002?

39:14.063 --> 39:15.971
Yeah.
Saturday morning the 19th,

39:15.972 --> 39:18.697
I was rushing to work and
got pulled over.

39:19.281 --> 39:21.210
Why didn't you put it in your timeline?

39:23.820 --> 39:26.088
It's all so humiliating.

39:26.691 --> 39:28.230
I met a guy

39:28.231 --> 39:30.062
down in Florida,

39:30.490 --> 39:33.393
had a stupid one night stand.

39:34.435 --> 39:36.850
It was a low point for me.
I was...

39:36.851 --> 39:39.363
kind of a mess back then.

39:39.694 --> 39:41.954
A guy.
Whose name is...?

39:42.149 --> 39:43.162
Greg.

39:44.019 --> 39:45.825
I never got a last name.

39:47.072 --> 39:48.747
We met Friday night.

39:49.390 --> 39:52.702
Partied pretty hard and
went back to his place.

39:53.520 --> 39:55.721
He seemed like a genuinely nice guy.

39:56.570 --> 39:57.719
Sure.

39:57.875 --> 39:59.823
Then Saturday morning I overslept.

39:59.824 --> 40:01.946
Which is why I was late,

40:01.947 --> 40:04.634
rushing to work, and
why I got pulled over.

40:05.044 --> 40:06.485
Did you see him again?

40:07.110 --> 40:08.649
No. But...

40:17.684 --> 40:19.028
Kate...

40:21.112 --> 40:23.255
I got pregnant.

40:23.684 --> 40:25.690
And it was the one night and,

40:25.691 --> 40:28.067
I never even got his phone number.

40:28.801 --> 40:30.964
And I just did what I had to do.

40:33.204 --> 40:34.860
I'm sorry.

40:36.183 --> 40:40.137
Ms. Hewes, I swear this is the only thing
I left out. Everything else is in there.

40:41.325 --> 40:43.955
When did frobisher's
people approach you?

40:44.939 --> 40:47.432
Fiske called me,

40:47.588 --> 40:50.276
about a week later,
and said that Arthur Frobisher

40:50.607 --> 40:53.179
liked my cooking and wanted
to help me open a restaurant.

40:53.529 --> 40:54.874
And what happened to Greg?

40:55.332 --> 40:56.384
No idea.

40:57.670 --> 40:59.754
Ever since Frobisher's been in the news,

40:59.755 --> 41:01.351
there's never been a connection.

41:01.352 --> 41:04.780
I've never heard his name,
never seen him,

41:05.287 --> 41:06.287
nothing.

41:09.650 --> 41:11.540
You do understand
why I lied to you, right?

41:12.183 --> 41:13.390
Yeah.

41:14.248 --> 41:15.261
Then...

41:16.176 --> 41:18.455
will you still be able
to use me as a witness?

41:19.410 --> 41:22.571
Well, you and I will go over
your timeline step by step.

41:22.572 --> 41:26.017
Hopefully, they'll be something
that will impeach Frobisher's story.

41:27.634 --> 41:28.959
But Kate...

41:29.640 --> 41:32.309
you're stepping into the spotlight now.

41:32.757 --> 41:35.036
Details of your life are going
to come out.

41:36.085 --> 41:39.436
This kind of scrutiny is
never easy for anyone.

41:40.196 --> 41:41.949
I understand.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.319
It's just...

41:47.231 --> 41:50.776
my brother and Ellen don't know
anything about this stuff.

41:51.361 --> 41:53.095
You don't have to tell them, do you?

41:53.504 --> 41:56.980
Well, at some point the truth
is gonna have to come out.

42:00.058 --> 42:01.811
I'll let you decide when.

42:07.371 --> 42:09.280
I spoke to Katie last night.

42:10.663 --> 42:14.294
- You're working, if it's a bad time...
- No, no...

42:14.547 --> 42:16.105
What did she say?

42:16.469 --> 42:17.911
Well...

42:21.359 --> 42:22.606
... you were right.

42:22.859 --> 42:24.554
She's not hiding anything.

42:24.749 --> 42:26.054
I trust her.

42:27.009 --> 42:29.444
But I want you to know that I had

42:29.445 --> 42:31.626
reasons for doing what I did.

42:32.502 --> 42:34.528
When I read her confidentiality
agreement,

42:34.529 --> 42:36.593
there was a section I found curious.

42:37.218 --> 42:38.218
Yeah?

42:38.250 --> 42:41.504
Ray Fiske had snuck in
a medical release waiver.

42:42.478 --> 42:44.932
Katie signed away access
to her medical records?

42:44.933 --> 42:47.348
Well, Fiske must think that...

42:47.472 --> 42:50.083
there's something in Katie's
past that would

42:50.084 --> 42:52.401
destroy her credibility as a witness.

42:52.615 --> 42:54.466
- Well, there isn't.
- Well,

42:55.187 --> 42:56.920
let's hope not.

42:58.217 --> 43:00.808
Meanwhile, she's given them
everything they want, so...

43:01.003 --> 43:02.425
She's protected.

43:02.717 --> 43:03.983
Yes.

43:05.152 --> 43:08.074
And you've had a very good first week.

43:15.891 --> 43:17.546
What are these for?

43:17.547 --> 43:20.217
A quiet, little place
on the Upper West Side.

43:20.548 --> 43:22.788
Nice light, safe street.

43:23.236 --> 43:24.619
I think you'll like it.

43:26.002 --> 43:27.230
How did you...

43:27.231 --> 43:29.197
Katie mentioned you were
looking for an apartment.

43:29.198 --> 43:31.995
Oh, I can't possibly accept,
Ms. Hewes, I...

43:31.996 --> 43:33.748
Please, please.

43:33.749 --> 43:34.898
You got a great bargain.

43:35.510 --> 43:37.984
- I did?
- I know the head of the co-op board.

43:38.666 --> 43:39.951
Ellen,

43:40.380 --> 43:42.367
next time you need something,

43:42.835 --> 43:44.081
come to me.

43:56.255 --> 43:57.326
Hey.

43:57.463 --> 43:58.463
Hey

44:00.092 --> 44:01.476
Been a long time.

44:01.885 --> 44:02.976
Yeah.

44:04.242 --> 44:07.047
I was, uh, a little surprised you called.

44:07.048 --> 44:08.615
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

44:08.616 --> 44:09.667
Greg,

44:10.291 --> 44:11.732
we need to talk.

44:12.316 --> 44:13.583
About what?

44:14.265 --> 44:16.174
Florida.

44:24.178 --> 44:26.516
Owen, medium rare, rare?

44:26.517 --> 44:27.821
Medium rare.

44:27.958 --> 44:29.197
Here we go.

44:29.198 --> 44:30.677
Oh, yeah.

44:32.431 --> 44:34.573
Here you are.
That one right there.

44:34.944 --> 44:37.495
- Yeah.
- Thanks, Dad.

44:37.671 --> 44:39.755
- Here you go, Mom.
- Thank you.

44:40.340 --> 44:42.055
- Looks pretty good.
- All right...

44:42.056 --> 44:44.198
who knows a joke?
Anyone got a joke?

44:44.199 --> 44:46.243
I do.
Knock, knock.

44:46.788 --> 44:49.126
- Who's there?
- Interrupting lawyer.

44:49.204 --> 44:50.930
- Interrupting lawyer...
- I object!

44:52.352 --> 44:54.105
Not too bad.

44:55.313 --> 44:57.456
Not too bad, where'd you hear that one?

45:03.402 --> 45:06.227
I think Katie's lying about
the guy she met in Florida.

45:07.103 --> 45:09.519
I think she's lying
about a lot of things.

45:14.111 --> 45:16.371
Katie Connor to see Ms. Hewes.

45:16.605 --> 45:18.981
I thought you might use a friend.

45:19.683 --> 45:20.949
For me?

45:21.962 --> 45:24.509
Oh, my God, he's adorable.

45:24.645 --> 45:26.164
He's a rescue.

45:26.690 --> 45:29.242
Oh, thank you so much.

45:29.243 --> 45:30.450
It's my pleasure.

45:31.483 --> 45:32.574
Katie...

45:33.337 --> 45:35.266
no more secrets between us.

45:35.499 --> 45:37.292
No more secrets.

45:50.391 --> 45:52.495
Oh, my God.

45:56.099 --> 45:57.736
Oh, my God.

45:58.963 --> 46:00.638
This place is ridiculous!

46:04.612 --> 46:06.522
- Oh, my God.
- It's too big!

46:06.834 --> 46:08.665
- We'll get lost.
- This is amazing.

46:09.119 --> 46:10.769
- What's in here?
- This is off the hook,

46:10.770 --> 46:12.619
- look at this.
- Oh, my God.

46:12.620 --> 46:13.963
This is huge!

46:25.691 --> 46:28.388
Oh, my God, Patty even sent
the welcoming committee.

46:29.440 --> 46:31.699
This place is perfect.

46:50.622 --> 46:53.564
I want to help you, Ellen,
'cause I know you didn't do it.
