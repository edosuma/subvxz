WEBVTT

00:02.219 --> 00:03.655
- We are all Black women.
- Yes.

00:03.655 --> 00:05.092
And we're all going through
our different things

00:05.092 --> 00:07.050
in our lives, and we're gonna
embrace that, okay?

00:07.050 --> 00:08.617
We're gonna keep Potomac
weird, okay?

00:08.617 --> 00:11.098
We in Austin.
We gotta keep Potomac weird.

00:11.098 --> 00:13.230
This season,

00:13.230 --> 00:15.102
on "The Real Housewives
of Potomac"...

00:15.102 --> 00:16.755
Do you want me
to stop dancing?

00:16.755 --> 00:18.453
No, never.

00:20.194 --> 00:23.240
Butt, Titties tight,
and get that booty right.

00:23.240 --> 00:26.113
Oh, my God!

00:26.113 --> 00:28.898
I would like to introduce you
to Demi and Diamond.

00:31.292 --> 00:34.164
Who at the table
swallows?

00:37.907 --> 00:43.260
There is a new Grande Dame
of Potomac.

00:43.260 --> 00:44.914
If only it were
that simple.

00:48.396 --> 00:51.399
The best drag show ever!

01:00.886 --> 01:02.584
I had a contact high
with ganja.

01:08.546 --> 01:09.852
- Hi.
- Ladies,

01:09.852 --> 01:10.679
this is my friend, Nneka,
I was telling you about.

01:10.679 --> 01:11.723
- Nneka?
- Hello, everyone.

01:11.723 --> 01:13.682
Hi. How are you?

01:13.682 --> 01:15.162
My daddy's a rich bitch,

01:15.162 --> 01:17.251
and he made sure his daughter
was a rich bitch, too.

01:17.251 --> 01:20.689
Thanks for buying me
a $2 million house.

01:20.689 --> 01:21.820
I most definitely think

01:21.820 --> 01:24.127
that you married Michael
for his money.

01:24.127 --> 01:25.694
Did you marry Gordon
for his money?

01:25.694 --> 01:27.087
I might have.

01:28.392 --> 01:30.873
The mother----er
who is suing me...

01:30.873 --> 01:32.875
- Hey!
- ...is still married

01:32.875 --> 01:34.790
to the woman
sitting in there.

01:34.790 --> 01:36.008
Juan was in a nail salon.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.053
Juan was in a laundromat.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.228
Juan was at the hotel.

01:38.228 --> 01:40.404
That's a Juan moment.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.232
People always got
somethin' to say.

01:42.232 --> 01:46.193
I... don't... care!

01:46.193 --> 01:48.195
You wanna turn me into
a----ing villain.

01:48.195 --> 01:50.022
I didn't do sh--
to none of y'all.

01:50.022 --> 01:51.546
Wendy's mom
started saying

01:51.546 --> 01:53.069
that she has a shrine
and that--

01:53.069 --> 01:54.723
She's doin' voodoo
on you?

01:54.723 --> 01:58.074
My mom worships our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.

01:58.074 --> 01:59.336
At day.

01:59.336 --> 02:00.816
By night, she's submitting
names to shrines.

02:02.209 --> 02:05.125
- Oh! Oh! Fire.
- Oh, God.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.693
This is the demons
coming to get us.

02:14.438 --> 02:16.223
- Just shut up. Shut up.
- No, I'm not shutting up!

02:16.223 --> 02:17.746
Shut up! I ain't listening
to your raggedy ass.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.095
Okay.
Blah, blah, blah.

02:19.095 --> 02:20.227
Uh-huh. We're good.
Blah, blah, blah.

02:20.227 --> 02:21.184
you!
- Blah, blah, blah, blah,

02:21.184 --> 02:24.187
blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah,

02:24.187 --> 02:25.536
blah, blah, blah, blah!

02:39.202 --> 02:40.290
The meeting I had with
the lawyer

02:40.290 --> 02:41.683
about the prenup--
- Mm-hmm.

02:41.683 --> 02:44.947
The question was posed,
like, do you put, like,

02:44.947 --> 02:46.470
an infidelity clause?

02:46.470 --> 02:47.906
I don't think
that's gonna be an issue.

02:49.821 --> 02:53.129
I declare that
Juan and Robyn are now, again,

02:53.129 --> 02:54.696
husband and wife.

03:04.314 --> 03:05.402
Where do we begin?

03:05.402 --> 03:08.275
Um... Juan and the girl
in Canada...

03:15.195 --> 03:17.806
I know that this is, like,
eating her up

03:17.806 --> 03:22.158
that everybody is poking holes
at her marriage.

03:22.158 --> 03:23.377
Now, we really know

03:23.377 --> 03:25.335
what's going on
beneath the surface.

03:30.297 --> 03:31.602
Robyn--
- Yeah.

03:31.602 --> 03:34.039
There is some sort of
strumpet out here...

03:34.039 --> 03:36.259
...that is staking claims
on Juan Dixon.

03:36.259 --> 03:39.262
Yes, Juan was an idiot.

03:39.262 --> 03:43.788
And communicated
with this woman on Instagram.

03:43.788 --> 03:45.181
Hmm...

03:45.181 --> 03:46.269
Young lady came forward.

03:46.269 --> 03:47.357
She shows this, like,

03:47.357 --> 03:49.229
hotel receipt
with his name on it.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.754
She's reaching
out to him.

03:52.754 --> 03:55.191
She tells him she lost her
wallet in the casino,

03:55.191 --> 03:56.801
and she cannot pay
for her hotel room.

03:56.801 --> 03:57.846
Okay.

03:57.846 --> 04:01.328
So, he feels bad
for her.

04:01.328 --> 04:04.592
He goes to the hotel,
puts his card down,

04:04.592 --> 04:06.985
and that's it.

04:06.985 --> 04:09.031
You believe that they were
never physical with each other.

04:09.031 --> 04:11.642
They were never physical. Yeah.

04:11.642 --> 04:13.383
She wants to believe
her husband.

04:13.383 --> 04:16.212
I get that,
but, whoa, girl,

04:16.212 --> 04:18.736
he signed
a whole-ass receipt.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.695
Okay, so, that should not
have happened,

04:20.695 --> 04:22.566
but they have gotten
past that.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.829
You just got outed
by the Canadian woman.

04:24.829 --> 04:26.614
And now, five seconds later,
in the laundromat

04:26.614 --> 04:27.832
with the girl
that you used to work with.

04:30.748 --> 04:33.403
This is a young lady
that used to work for Juan

04:33.403 --> 04:35.362
who was on his staff.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.494
It just don't look right.
It just looks bad.

04:37.494 --> 04:41.019
Now, there was another
picture surfacing of Juan...

04:44.109 --> 04:45.763
...in a nail salon,
of all places.

04:48.940 --> 04:50.812
The-the nail salon
was a little too much for me.

04:50.812 --> 04:52.553
I was screaming and yelling
when I saw it.

04:53.728 --> 04:55.512
Robyn is on another
planet this year.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.953
But the truth
will set you free.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.848
So handsome.

05:30.808 --> 05:33.898
- Hey.
- Hey, how was your workout?

05:33.898 --> 05:35.422
It was good.

05:35.422 --> 05:36.814
What you up to?
- So, I got--

05:36.814 --> 05:38.773
so, you know all those--
- Oh, okay.

05:38.773 --> 05:40.383
So, you know
all those frames in my--

05:40.383 --> 05:42.385
in the office?
- Mm-hmm.

05:42.385 --> 05:43.778
I finally got the pictures
to go into 'em.

05:43.778 --> 05:45.736
Oh, cool.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.434
So, decided just to use
all the wedding pictures.

05:47.434 --> 05:48.652
- What's up?
- Hey.

05:51.002 --> 05:53.440
- Oh, look at Corey. Okay.
- Here, so it's--

05:53.440 --> 05:55.529
I know, right?
He looks so handsome.

05:55.529 --> 05:56.791
You got 'em
in black and white?

05:56.791 --> 05:58.575
Fits the aesthetic
in the office.

05:58.575 --> 06:01.056
Hmm.
Oh, my God, Carter.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.623
Dang, he's grown up
so much since then.

06:02.623 --> 06:03.711
Right?

06:03.711 --> 06:05.190
- That's crazy.
- I know.

06:05.190 --> 06:08.455
This is, like, my first day
kind of feeling settled

06:08.455 --> 06:10.979
since we got back
from the Bahamas.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.459
- Oh.
- Did you have fun?

06:12.459 --> 06:13.808
Yeah, it was good.
It was a great trip.

06:13.808 --> 06:15.331
Yeah, yeah.

06:15.331 --> 06:18.334
Now, it's, like,
back to real life.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.727
Back to reality.

06:19.727 --> 06:23.687
Which, sh--, right now,
real life is a-a bitch.

06:23.687 --> 06:25.820
It's all good.
That's part of life.

06:25.820 --> 06:26.821
Yeah.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.826
It's a lot.

06:31.826 --> 06:34.350
Like, all of the noise
that's been going on,

06:34.350 --> 06:37.614
the whole...
girl with the hotel receipt.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.573
And once again,
that was stupid.

06:42.314 --> 06:43.794
That was foolish.
- But--

06:43.794 --> 06:45.448
- But?
- We chose to move forward.

06:45.448 --> 06:48.408
We chose to get married.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.193
I wasn't expecting, like,
the firestorm

06:51.193 --> 06:52.847
that came out of it

06:52.847 --> 06:55.371
when Gizelle and I
addressed it on the podcast.

06:55.371 --> 06:58.026
Like, but--
- I told you not to do that.

06:58.026 --> 06:59.114
It is what it is.

06:59.114 --> 07:01.682
But, like,
people really took that

07:01.682 --> 07:04.119
and, like,
and ran with it.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.340
That was me, yes.

07:08.340 --> 07:11.126
But it was me being nice.
- Right.

07:11.126 --> 07:13.824
I've given homeless--
random homeless people

07:13.824 --> 07:16.436
$20, $50 before because
I wanted to do a good deed.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.654
- Right.
- Well, this was a young lady

07:17.654 --> 07:20.483
that said she was going
to visit

07:20.483 --> 07:22.180
a dude that played
for the Ravens.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.443
- Right.
- Okay.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.140
She lost her wallet
at the casino.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.490
- Right.
- She reached out to me.

07:27.490 --> 07:28.926
I got her the hotel room.

07:28.926 --> 07:33.409
I know it sounds weird,
but that's the truth.

07:33.409 --> 07:36.760
Right. But my, okay,
my question, though

07:36.760 --> 07:38.196
is, like,

07:38.196 --> 07:40.242
okay, you're, like,
at a hotel room with a woman.

07:40.242 --> 07:43.506
Like, why not go for it?

07:43.506 --> 07:47.554
- With who?
- With her.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.556
Did you see her?

07:49.556 --> 07:51.340
I mean, uh,
not in person.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.559
You saw her.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.517
- I didn't do anything.
- Yeah, but-but--

07:54.517 --> 07:56.084
I-I--
it-it was on me, though.

07:56.084 --> 07:56.954
I----ed up.

07:56.954 --> 07:58.216
Yes, you----ed up.

07:58.216 --> 07:59.783
You shouldn't have been
friendly with her.

07:59.783 --> 08:01.959
I don't know why you were.
- Yeah, I'm-I'm too friendly.

08:01.959 --> 08:04.396
I'm too nice.

08:04.396 --> 08:06.703
- But--
- I am too nice.

08:06.703 --> 08:08.444
But we worked through it.

08:08.444 --> 08:10.446
At this point,
it's been a year and a half.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.361
So, a year ago,
when I'm, like, hanging around

08:12.361 --> 08:13.536
with the other ladies
and stuff,

08:13.536 --> 08:15.277
and, like,
for people to judge me

08:15.277 --> 08:18.585
for, like, not sharing that
while we were, like,

08:18.585 --> 08:20.021
preparing for
our wedding and stuff--

08:20.021 --> 08:22.197
I just think
Robyn panicked, to be honest.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.981
She said she was waiting
for you to bring it up.

08:23.981 --> 08:25.635
Isn't that amazing
that she's waiting for me

08:25.635 --> 08:27.594
to out Juan's women
for her?

08:27.594 --> 08:29.552
First word or phrase--
Robyn Dixon.

08:29.552 --> 08:30.727
A fraud.

08:30.727 --> 08:32.860
I heard from Candiace
earlier today.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.775
I heard she was, like,
tweeting a lot.

08:34.775 --> 08:37.473
She's also really angry
and disappointed.

08:37.473 --> 08:39.388
She feels betrayed by you.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.868
Why?

08:40.868 --> 08:45.786
You know, the minute I heard
what Candiace was saying,

08:45.786 --> 08:48.484
it was quite shocking
because, last year,

08:48.484 --> 08:50.486
I showed her as much support
as I could.

08:50.486 --> 08:52.357
I don't think
it's a big deal.

08:52.357 --> 08:54.316
I think
whatever you were saying

08:54.316 --> 08:55.491
was out of concern
for your wife.

08:55.491 --> 08:56.797
Mm-hmm.

08:56.797 --> 08:59.669
They think that, like,
our relationship is fake,

08:59.669 --> 09:01.976
or that we have an arrangement,
and then, of course,

09:01.976 --> 09:03.630
they don't believe the story,
like, you know.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.240
Well, of course,
they don't believe the story.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.589
- Right.
- It sounds weird.

09:06.589 --> 09:08.678
- Right.
- But it's the truth.

09:10.854 --> 09:12.421
Right.

09:12.421 --> 09:13.553
I know it sounds crazy,

09:13.553 --> 09:17.034
but the reason
I-I chose to believe it,

09:17.034 --> 09:21.082
is because Juan wouldn't
make somethin' up that stupid.

09:21.082 --> 09:22.518
- No, that's not--
- You know what I'm saying?

09:22.518 --> 09:24.346
Like, if you were to-to--
- I'm not that good.

09:24.346 --> 09:25.477
I'm not that good.
- Right.

09:25.477 --> 09:28.916
99.9% that heard that story--
- Right.

09:28.916 --> 09:32.572
Thinks that
you lied to me.

09:32.572 --> 09:36.880
It's-- but that is--
it's okay,

09:36.880 --> 09:40.014
but I don't know...
it's all good.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.711
People gonna think
what they want.

09:41.711 --> 09:45.106
I guess it was exacerbated
by the whole...

09:45.106 --> 09:46.934
...you in the laundromat.

09:46.934 --> 09:48.544
- Working?
- Like, working.

09:48.544 --> 09:49.806
Yeah, that's so crazy.

09:49.806 --> 09:51.373
It's like, you called me
that morning, like,

09:51.373 --> 09:54.202
"All right, me and Coach Bre,
we're going to laundromat.

09:54.202 --> 09:55.551
"We're gon-- we're gon' wash
the practice jerseys."

09:55.551 --> 09:56.900
They don't know.
See, I don't know.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.989
She saw Juan Dixon
in a laundromat

09:58.989 --> 10:00.861
with his co-worker--
Maybe she didn't know.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.689
And they see us in public,

10:02.689 --> 10:05.866
recently, at the, uh,
nail salon.

10:05.866 --> 10:07.563
Men and women work together
all the time.

10:07.563 --> 10:08.912
They chill together.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.958
They don't know
the relationship, though, Rob.

10:10.958 --> 10:14.352
But Coach Bre is a beautiful,
attractive woman.

10:17.094 --> 10:18.226
Right. She's--

10:18.226 --> 10:20.663
like, people almost think
we look alike.

10:20.663 --> 10:21.838
She's a beautiful woman.

10:21.838 --> 10:24.624
So, yes,
you see attractive dude

10:24.624 --> 10:25.886
with an attractive woman,
and you think--

10:25.886 --> 10:27.583
Right, and she's young--
So, of course,

10:27.583 --> 10:29.846
their imagination's
gonna run wild and stuff.

10:29.846 --> 10:32.457
And then, on top of that,
you lost your job,

10:32.457 --> 10:34.111
which is, like, devastating.

10:34.111 --> 10:35.678
- It's not devastating.
- So, what is it?

10:35.678 --> 10:38.072
But it's,
I mean, it's-it's hard.

10:38.072 --> 10:40.422
I mean, I felt like
I loved my job.

10:40.422 --> 10:41.510
I was passionate
about my job.

10:41.510 --> 10:42.903
Right.

10:42.903 --> 10:46.341
But, I guess we didn't
win enough basketball games,

10:46.341 --> 10:47.995
but when you have
key injuries.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.911
You know, I know, but I also,
like, I hate that, like,

10:50.911 --> 10:53.261
the public thinks
that you lost your job

10:53.261 --> 10:55.350
for another reason.

10:55.350 --> 10:59.441
It's unfortunate that
certain things came out,

10:59.441 --> 11:01.486
nothing factual.

11:01.486 --> 11:04.272
And then you have people
almost, like, rejoicing,

11:04.272 --> 11:05.926
because you lost your job
because they think

11:05.926 --> 11:07.188
that you did something wrong.
- That's fine

11:07.188 --> 11:08.798
because they're miserable.
- And it's like--

11:08.798 --> 11:11.714
I ain't did sh-- to nobody.
I mind my business.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.368
I don't party.
I don't drink.

11:13.368 --> 11:15.457
I'm not all over
social media.

11:15.457 --> 11:16.980
Well, you are now.

11:16.980 --> 11:19.896
Well, yeah, I guess,
but you know what that's about.

11:19.896 --> 11:22.638
In today's society,
people want likes.

11:22.638 --> 11:23.900
They want clicks.
- I--

11:23.900 --> 11:25.772
I hate giving this
particular story energy.

11:25.772 --> 11:28.209
I wanna be focused on
raisin' our boys.

11:34.258 --> 11:35.956
Coming up next...

11:35.956 --> 11:36.913
Do you want me
to feed it to you?

11:36.913 --> 11:38.175
- Please don't.
- Look away.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.526
Disgusting.

11:41.526 --> 11:43.833
The west wing
is seeing some things

11:43.833 --> 11:45.400
it hasn't seen in a while.

11:45.400 --> 11:46.575
Blech.

11:46.575 --> 11:48.751
Robyn came after you,
came after me,

11:48.751 --> 11:50.840
and came after you
in order not to talk

11:50.840 --> 11:52.755
about her truth.
- About--

11:52.755 --> 11:54.365
It's clear
that you are projecting

11:54.365 --> 11:57.455
and deflecting from what
you have currently going on

11:57.455 --> 11:58.892
in your life.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.385
Ooh, no.

12:18.128 --> 12:20.174
- Hello. Hi.
How are you today?
- Hi, how are you?

12:20.174 --> 12:23.307
I would love some champagne
and an orange rind.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.832
- Okay.
- Thank you.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.442
- Girl--
- Yes.

12:28.356 --> 12:31.838
Hi!

12:31.838 --> 12:33.578
- Hi. How are you?
- Good. You look great.

12:33.578 --> 12:35.842
- You look fabulous.
- Thank you.

12:35.842 --> 12:37.800
- Give me your purse.
- Yes.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.846
A purse, inside of a purse,
inside of a purse.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.151
So, we're gonna
wait for Wendy.

12:41.151 --> 12:42.849
Oh, very good. She's OTW.
She's on the way.

12:42.849 --> 12:43.893
- She's on her way?
- Yeah.

12:43.893 --> 12:45.939
She lives way in
outer Mongolia.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.897
You need to give her
some grace.

12:47.897 --> 12:50.073
Oh, your drink.
- Thank you, darling.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.249
Let's do the-
the Threat Level Midnight.

12:52.249 --> 12:53.511
- Sounds good.
- Yes. Thank you.

12:53.511 --> 12:56.123
Thank you.
You're headed to L.A., again.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.428
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, how exciting.

12:57.428 --> 13:00.431
I have two shows
for tomorrow and Saturday.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.564
All right.

13:02.564 --> 13:03.826
- Ahh!
- Cheers, enjoy.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.697
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Oh, yes.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.788
- Hi, beautiful.
- Hey, look at you. Muah.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.441
Oh, my gosh.
Where have you been?

13:10.441 --> 13:12.617
Yes, Valentine's Day.
- How are you doing?

13:14.837 --> 13:16.317
All there.

13:16.317 --> 13:18.798
- Girl.
- There's holes on the floor.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.625
Oh, I almost died.

13:20.625 --> 13:22.497
Hello. Excuse me.

13:22.497 --> 13:24.629
Would I be a Debbie Downer
if I get water?

13:24.629 --> 13:25.543
- No.
- Yes.

13:25.543 --> 13:26.631
No.

13:26.631 --> 13:29.243
- Okay, can I get--
- No pressure.

13:29.243 --> 13:30.897
Do you have, like,
a margarita?

13:30.897 --> 13:32.855
I have, like,
the grand margarita.

13:32.855 --> 13:33.987
Okay, I will do that, please.

13:33.987 --> 13:35.075
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Thank you so much.

13:35.075 --> 13:36.467
I appreciate that.
Thank you.

13:36.467 --> 13:38.774
You guys, uh, so, for lent,
I gave up alcohol.

13:38.774 --> 13:40.080
- Okay, oh.
- Oh.

13:40.080 --> 13:42.386
And no, no, no,
you know, lent is over now.

13:42.386 --> 13:44.649
Is it just Catholic people
that give up stuff for lent,

13:44.649 --> 13:45.781
or is-- is that everybody?
- No.

13:45.781 --> 13:47.087
- You give up.
- Baptists give up.

13:47.087 --> 13:50.742
Okay. I be carrying my--
I carry my rosary.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.135
That's why I'm protected.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.140
I knew she was Catholic.

13:57.140 --> 13:58.881
I didn't know she kept
the rosary in her purse.

13:58.881 --> 14:00.491
Wendy,
where was this rosary?

14:00.491 --> 14:02.842
You could have pulled
the rosary out for me.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.147
Getting this girl
time off, overtime.

14:04.147 --> 14:06.584
I'm protected
with my rosary.

14:06.584 --> 14:07.672
You need to
pull that out.

14:07.672 --> 14:10.023
That's why they mess
with me,

14:10.023 --> 14:11.459
but it bounces off.
- Yes.

14:11.459 --> 14:13.548
Well, let's talk about that,
bouncing off of us.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.463
You know, I got us
together because I wanted

14:15.463 --> 14:16.594
to see where you guys are.

14:16.594 --> 14:17.900
What's going on
wit' you all?

14:17.900 --> 14:19.293
Yes, very good.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.556
Because when we left New York,
it was a hot mess.

14:21.556 --> 14:22.992
You assaulted me.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.428
you forever.

14:24.428 --> 14:25.255
I want you to understand that.
- You----ed Peter,

14:25.255 --> 14:26.300
and that's the real story.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.867
You are a garbage individual.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.086
You have no soul.

14:30.086 --> 14:33.611
Karen was implying that
Juan sexually assaulted her.

14:33.611 --> 14:35.004
You said that. You--
- Does he need to keep his hands

14:35.004 --> 14:37.267
off of women
inappropriately? Yes.

14:37.267 --> 14:39.139
We've said
some ugly things, you know,

14:39.139 --> 14:41.706
and we're all capable
of forgiveness.

14:41.706 --> 14:44.187
We can only pray.

14:44.187 --> 14:47.016
So, where are you at
with everyone else?

14:47.016 --> 14:48.844
I'm okay with Gizelle.

14:48.844 --> 14:51.064
Uh, Ashley, I'm okay.

14:51.064 --> 14:55.546
Robyn has
some ownership to take.

14:55.546 --> 14:57.374
Because truth has come out.

14:57.374 --> 14:59.550
We can only get along
if we--

14:59.550 --> 15:00.900
If we are being honest.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.640
If we are being honest
'cause the biggest liar

15:02.640 --> 15:05.469
is the woman
who hid her truth.

15:05.469 --> 15:08.081
We were the targets
in order not to talk

15:08.081 --> 15:11.562
about her truth.
- About--

15:11.562 --> 15:14.391
Came after you, came after me,
and came after you.

15:14.391 --> 15:16.916
The focus of
the entire year

15:16.916 --> 15:19.788
became maligning
my husband's name,

15:19.788 --> 15:22.356
but we discovered that,
all this time,

15:22.356 --> 15:25.489
she has a whole scandal
with her husband.

15:25.489 --> 15:28.405
What really, like,
blew my wig over there,

15:28.405 --> 15:30.146
was when she said,

15:30.146 --> 15:32.235
"I was waiting for Karen
to bring it up."

15:32.235 --> 15:34.977
It happened before we
filmed season seven.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.500
How do you stay silent?

15:36.500 --> 15:39.939
I was waiting for
Karen to bring it up.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.375
I clearly said "Look..."

15:41.375 --> 15:42.985
I was dealing with Juan's
domestic women.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.596
Not international women.

15:45.596 --> 15:48.773
There's so much I know
about Robyn Dixon,

15:48.773 --> 15:51.037
including Juan's
other woman.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.647
Yeah, that looks like me.

15:55.345 --> 15:59.349
She behaved, with all of us,
as if everything was fine.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.574
One day, people are going to
see you for who you are.

16:06.574 --> 16:08.010
People see me, right now,
and they clearly--

16:08.010 --> 16:09.446
Yeah, a bullsh---er.

16:09.446 --> 16:12.145
And the only liar
is Robyn Dixon.

16:18.238 --> 16:19.891
Ooh, that's
a good question.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.023
I have.

16:21.023 --> 16:22.111
I'm an open book.

16:22.111 --> 16:25.114
Robyn is
a bald-face liar, okay?

16:25.114 --> 16:26.507
There is a total difference.

16:30.902 --> 16:33.079
Next question.

16:35.211 --> 16:36.821
It was such a projection.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.388
It was a deflection.

16:38.388 --> 16:41.652
It's clear that you are
projecting and deflecting

16:41.652 --> 16:44.003
from what you have currently
going on in your life.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.396
If Robyn owns her sh--,
we got no problem.

16:46.396 --> 16:48.920
She doesn't care
if he cheats on her.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.270
Robyn just needs to say,

16:50.270 --> 16:51.662
"Look, we have
an understanding."

16:51.662 --> 16:53.142
Yes.

16:53.142 --> 16:54.448
- If she doesn't care--
- Because it's an arrangement.

16:54.448 --> 16:56.363
If she doesn't care,
then I don't care.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.626
Are they even-- have you seen
the marriage certificate?

17:10.072 --> 17:11.552
All right, who's gonna
help me with the trash?

17:13.206 --> 17:15.164
Oh, big boy, okay.

17:15.164 --> 17:17.036
Look at this team.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.038
Okay, almost there, champ.

17:20.865 --> 17:22.345
Good job, buddy.

17:23.651 --> 17:25.174
Just the cutest.

17:25.174 --> 17:26.610
All right, let's go
make our lunch.

17:26.610 --> 17:29.396
Welcome to Ashley Darby's
Seaside in the City.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.054
I am now a homeowner,

17:35.054 --> 17:38.405
and the inspiration for
the decor is coastal chic.

17:38.405 --> 17:40.581
Previously, living
in my penthouse,

17:40.581 --> 17:42.104
it was very dark.

17:42.104 --> 17:44.454
The finishes were really
dark gray and brown.

17:44.454 --> 17:47.936
So I want it to be light
and airy, very natural tones,

17:47.936 --> 17:50.678
with blues, and greens,
and tans.

17:50.678 --> 17:53.246
I love it, it's really just
my little slice of heaven.

17:54.160 --> 17:55.596
Now, I am paying for it.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.685
I just had to get my ass
out of the penthouse right then.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.774
I'll start it, and then
you finish cutting it.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.386
Yeah, very nice.

18:03.386 --> 18:04.909
Boobie, do you like
your new house?

18:04.909 --> 18:07.086
Right?

18:07.086 --> 18:10.219
It's definitely different
having Dean and Dylan

18:10.219 --> 18:12.091
in the house
without Michael.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.483
I'm full-time mom.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.233
Oh, Dean, did you
help him up there?

18:25.278 --> 18:26.757
All right, guys.
Let's be careful.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.281
I have to be really aware

18:28.281 --> 18:31.240
of how available
I am for my kids.

18:31.240 --> 18:32.502
Like, I don't really
have anyone else

18:32.502 --> 18:33.895
who can, like, take
the kids for a minute.

18:33.895 --> 18:35.418
It's really just me.

18:35.418 --> 18:37.725
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Daise.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.596
And Daisy.

18:39.596 --> 18:42.077
What's your favorite part
about your new house, booba?

18:42.077 --> 18:43.948
Playing with my brother.

18:43.948 --> 18:45.341
Playing with
your brother.

18:45.341 --> 18:46.690
And what do you guys
like to do that's different

18:46.690 --> 18:47.952
from daddy's house?

18:47.952 --> 18:49.519
'Cause you have
two houses, right?

18:49.519 --> 18:52.609
You have this house
and daddy's house.

18:52.609 --> 18:55.177
Michael's name is still
on the mortgage of my home,

18:55.177 --> 18:57.397
but Michael doesn't
have a room in my home.

18:57.397 --> 18:59.094
He actually has only been
upstairs in my house,

18:59.094 --> 19:00.878
like, two or
three times, ever.

19:00.878 --> 19:03.838
I don't know what will happen
with Michael and me financially

19:03.838 --> 19:05.970
until we're fully divorced.

19:05.970 --> 19:09.496
Um, I'm not in any rush, necessarily,

19:09.496 --> 19:11.324
to take Michael's name
off the mortgage.

19:11.324 --> 19:13.413
You know, it's like there is
that little bit of security

19:13.413 --> 19:14.849
where if something
goes wrong,

19:14.849 --> 19:16.894
like, he's there to
also help me, you know.

19:16.894 --> 19:19.332
My favorite little spot.

19:22.509 --> 19:23.727
Hi.

19:23.727 --> 19:25.294
Hi, sunshine.

19:25.294 --> 19:26.730
Where are you going?

19:26.730 --> 19:29.211
I'm actually-- my kids
have a dentist appointment.

19:29.211 --> 19:30.517
How are you doing?

19:30.517 --> 19:32.301
I mean, so, Grace is
about to go to college.

19:32.301 --> 19:35.130
Yeah, and I'm
moving in with you.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.871
Ha! Good.

19:36.871 --> 19:38.829
I really need some extra
help with the kids.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.006
So, like, what-what's
going on over there

19:42.006 --> 19:45.662
'cause I saw that Michael
was in the Bahamas with you?

19:45.662 --> 19:48.404
So, I just wanna be clear.

19:48.404 --> 19:50.363
Wait, where did you
see that?

19:50.363 --> 19:52.408
Somebody DMed it to me.

19:52.408 --> 19:54.410
Oh, well, no,
it was really good.

19:54.410 --> 19:57.239
We went as-as coparents,
as friends.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.372
Are you divorced?

20:01.548 --> 20:03.027
No, we're still
hashing out.

20:03.027 --> 20:05.508
Now, we're going through
just, like, discussing custody,

20:05.508 --> 20:08.032
but, for the most part,
we've agreed on the big things.

20:08.032 --> 20:10.513
But he did kick in the money
a little bit, right?

20:10.513 --> 20:11.993
Yeah, he helped pay
for the down payment

20:11.993 --> 20:12.994
on my house, for example.

20:12.994 --> 20:15.170
He does pay child support.

20:15.170 --> 20:16.302
Okay, I like that.

20:16.302 --> 20:17.520
Yeah, so, it's not alimony,

20:17.520 --> 20:19.174
but he's-he's not
leaving me high and dry

20:19.174 --> 20:20.697
or anything, you know.

20:20.697 --> 20:23.526
What is the status
of the prenup?

20:23.526 --> 20:25.833
Will you get half
of what he has?

20:25.833 --> 20:27.356
No, man.

20:27.356 --> 20:29.140
According to the prenup,
I am not allowed to get alimony.

20:29.140 --> 20:30.403
Wow.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.883
In complete honesty,
I am dragging my feet

20:32.883 --> 20:34.711
quite a bit
with my divorce.

20:34.711 --> 20:36.931
It's pretty hard.

20:36.931 --> 20:39.281
You know what? I'm also
inviting you to my house.

20:39.281 --> 20:40.804
Oh, yes.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.980
So, I want you to come over.
I'm gonna invite, like,

20:42.980 --> 20:45.766
Charrisse, Robyn.
- Yeah.

20:45.766 --> 20:47.898
I think we all need
to, like, have a moment

20:47.898 --> 20:49.726
with Robyn to encourage--

20:49.726 --> 20:51.467
I don't wanna call
her delusional.

20:51.467 --> 20:52.599
I don't wanna say that.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.601
I wanna say looking at
her relationship

20:54.601 --> 20:56.167
from a different perspective.

20:56.167 --> 20:58.779
Yes, so a little shift.

20:58.779 --> 21:00.911
The things that Robyn
is going through,

21:00.911 --> 21:02.913
people don't make it
to the other side.

21:02.913 --> 21:05.916
People can't handle
what Robyn is handling.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.701
This is a lot for anybody.

21:07.701 --> 21:10.617
So, yes, my concern for
her mental health is huge.

21:10.617 --> 21:13.010
I have had experience
with difficult conversations

21:13.010 --> 21:16.449
with Robyn in the past,
especially involving Juan,

21:16.449 --> 21:18.842
and that has not
gone over very well.

21:18.842 --> 21:21.454
I think that your relationship
is a hindrance.

21:21.454 --> 21:22.759
You are not in a situation

21:22.759 --> 21:24.500
that is conducive
to a happy life.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.372
- Yes.
- Get the outta here.

21:27.503 --> 21:30.854
So, I don't really have
the best expectations

21:30.854 --> 21:32.421
for this conversation.

21:32.421 --> 21:34.684
I-I just wanna support her
to get through this

21:34.684 --> 21:37.948
and to get to a better place,
however that looks.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.602
What does she say
when you ask her about

21:39.602 --> 21:42.431
the relationship with
this girl and him,

21:42.431 --> 21:44.085
and why were they
in the nail salon together?

21:44.085 --> 21:45.260
She said they're
just friends.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.653
Juan always feels
sorry for people,

21:46.653 --> 21:48.524
and he just
befriends people,

21:48.524 --> 21:51.048
because he's a nice guy.

21:56.315 --> 21:59.796
He's nice-nice.
He's nice, okay?

21:59.796 --> 22:02.321
Her perspective is different
from everyone else's,

22:02.321 --> 22:03.974
and I just want
her to know, like,

22:03.974 --> 22:05.672
you look crazy.
- Yes.

22:07.413 --> 22:09.153
Coming up next...

22:09.153 --> 22:10.851
We pivoted pretty quickly
once we got through

22:10.851 --> 22:12.679
our two or three months
of woe is us,

22:12.679 --> 22:14.898
and did we do
anything wrong and...

22:14.898 --> 22:16.639
Babe, you went through
a whole depression.

22:16.639 --> 22:17.814
Well-well, I went
through a depression.

22:17.814 --> 22:22.341
You sat on that sofa
for two months.

22:30.653 --> 22:32.612
Okay, I hear
a lot of noise.

22:34.309 --> 22:36.442
Oh, my gosh,
what's happening?

22:38.052 --> 22:39.401
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

22:39.401 --> 22:40.707
The noise means
it's going down.

22:40.707 --> 22:43.753
I could not
be more excited.

22:46.713 --> 22:47.844
Okay.
- So, you have three different
types of tuna.

22:47.844 --> 22:49.280
Okay, which one
tastes better?

22:49.280 --> 22:50.499
Salmon-- we're
gonna try it all.

22:50.499 --> 22:51.413
We're gonna try it all. Okay.

22:51.413 --> 22:53.633
And then scallops?

22:53.633 --> 22:55.678
Oh.
- Say no more.

22:55.678 --> 22:56.853
We're gonna do
cooked scallops,

22:56.853 --> 22:58.768
and we're gonna do
raw salmon and tuna.

22:58.768 --> 23:00.074
I have a bigger pan.

23:00.074 --> 23:01.423
- Do you?
- Yeah, I do.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.903
Okay, let me get that.

23:02.903 --> 23:03.991
That way, I can bend over.
- Bigger is always better.

23:03.991 --> 23:05.340
And you can check
out the scene.

23:05.340 --> 23:06.820
Oh, oh, oh, my.

23:06.820 --> 23:08.996
I'm not looking.

23:08.996 --> 23:11.433
All right.
Like, somethin' like this?

23:11.433 --> 23:12.782
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- This better?

23:12.782 --> 23:14.958
That'll keep things
from popping up.

23:20.660 --> 23:22.226
Jason is how many years
younger than me?

23:23.445 --> 23:24.707
No one is counting.

23:24.707 --> 23:26.405
Do you want me
to stop dancing?

23:26.405 --> 23:28.668
No, never.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.801
Mama gotta live.

23:31.801 --> 23:33.150
You know, mama has been
mama for a long time,

23:33.150 --> 23:35.544
but I got to live.
I got to do my thing.

23:35.544 --> 23:38.460
And I did run up on
this guy named Jason,

23:38.460 --> 23:40.680
and he's a young,
hot thing,

23:40.680 --> 23:43.030
a little tenderoni.

23:43.030 --> 23:45.467
When I first met Jason,
Ashley introduced us,

23:45.467 --> 23:47.948
and for whatever reason,

23:47.948 --> 23:50.733
Jason and I definitely
just clicked.

23:50.733 --> 23:53.083
He has been keeping me
quite occupied,

23:53.083 --> 23:56.347
and the west wing is
seeing some things

23:56.347 --> 23:58.611
it hasn't seen in a while.

23:58.611 --> 24:01.701
Should I start with-with
the gloves, or no?

24:01.701 --> 24:03.006
Not until we start
using the rice.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.355
Okay.

24:04.355 --> 24:05.269
Did you bring
that knife?

24:05.269 --> 24:06.749
- I did.
- Wow.

24:06.749 --> 24:08.229
This is actually
very special.

24:08.229 --> 24:10.013
Well, you know,
I haven't seen you in weeks.

24:10.013 --> 24:11.232
I know.

24:11.232 --> 24:13.364
Sometimes I, like,
get kinda weirded out.

24:13.364 --> 24:15.018
I'm like,
I need to see you.

24:15.018 --> 24:16.672
Yeah, I'm like, when am I
gonna see her, again?

24:16.672 --> 24:20.154
I haven't even really,
like, gotten into, like,

24:20.154 --> 24:21.503
Gizelle nagging mode.

24:21.503 --> 24:24.506
Like, I need to see you.

24:24.506 --> 24:25.638
Do you get
into that mode?

24:25.638 --> 24:27.988
No, it's not
really what I do.

24:27.988 --> 24:29.293
However, I can.

24:29.293 --> 24:30.599
Jason, with his cute self,

24:30.599 --> 24:32.688
lives all the way up
in New York,

24:32.688 --> 24:34.211
and I live,
you know, down here

24:34.211 --> 24:35.561
in the Potomac area.

24:35.561 --> 24:37.519
So, we try to see each other
as much as we can.

24:37.519 --> 24:39.521
It's hard.
I think we manage it,

24:39.521 --> 24:41.175
like, every other
week or so.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.177
Either I'm going there,
or he's coming to see me,

24:43.177 --> 24:45.440
and it's nice 'cause,
you know, I don't like

24:45.440 --> 24:47.007
somebody in my face
all the time.

24:47.007 --> 24:48.138
So, it's perfect.

24:48.138 --> 24:49.705
So, tell me about
this trip to Dubai.

24:49.705 --> 24:52.621
I have heard nothing
other than the flower garden.

24:52.621 --> 24:53.709
Whose idea was
the flower garden?

24:53.709 --> 24:54.580
- Adore.
- Okay.

24:54.580 --> 24:55.798
Yes.

24:55.798 --> 24:57.408
Grace is about to graduate
from high school

24:57.408 --> 24:59.541
and go to college, baby.

24:59.541 --> 25:01.195
So proud of her,
so happy for her,

25:01.195 --> 25:02.936
but, yes, it is sad.

25:04.938 --> 25:07.288
That's my baby girl.
That's my first love.

25:07.288 --> 25:10.683
You know, college is
the next right step for her.

25:10.683 --> 25:13.555
Um, however,
before we get sad,

25:13.555 --> 25:15.078
this is
her last spring break,

25:15.078 --> 25:17.907
and I was like we're going
to go to Dubai, honey.

25:17.907 --> 25:20.649
We're gonna ride camels.
We're gonna go shopping.

25:20.649 --> 25:21.998
And it was fantastic.

25:21.998 --> 25:24.610
No stone unturned
in the Dubai.

25:24.610 --> 25:27.134
So, not happy
but happy for her.

25:27.134 --> 25:29.310
Last time, you made--
what did you make?

25:29.310 --> 25:31.355
We did pasta ala vodka.

25:31.355 --> 25:33.053
- With scallops.
- On the side.

25:33.053 --> 25:35.011
- That was amazing.
- That was-- that was tasty.

25:35.011 --> 25:37.579
Didn't think that
you could top that.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.016
Well, you know,
this is, um,

25:40.016 --> 25:41.583
welcome back from
Dubai din-din.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.933
Ooh.

25:43.933 --> 25:45.369
Um, all right.
Angel has to help.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.197
Angel!

25:47.197 --> 25:48.634
Coming!

25:48.634 --> 25:51.288
All right, Angel, it is time
to make some sushi.

25:51.288 --> 25:53.334
The day that I met Jason,
I invited Jason

25:53.334 --> 25:56.337
to my live show in New York
of "Reasonably Shady."

25:56.337 --> 25:58.905
And, of course, the girls
were there helping me.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.037
Grace peeped him
peeping me,

26:01.037 --> 26:02.691
and she was like,
"Mommy, who is he?

26:02.691 --> 26:04.127
You're not slick."
And I was like,

26:04.127 --> 26:05.738
"Oh, that's my friend.
That's-- his name is Jason."

26:05.738 --> 26:07.478
She just was like,
"Is this my brother?

26:07.478 --> 26:08.828
"How old is he?"

26:08.828 --> 26:10.046
I was kind of on edge

26:10.046 --> 26:11.961
because I didn't
really know him,

26:11.961 --> 26:14.311
and this random guy is
just following us around.

26:14.311 --> 26:16.487
Like, I just was confused.

26:16.487 --> 26:17.706
Hey.

26:17.706 --> 26:18.707
I thought you were
gonna make the sushi.

26:18.707 --> 26:19.926
- Hey, you want to help?
- I am.

26:19.926 --> 26:21.362
- I love it.
- I'm ready.

26:21.362 --> 26:23.320
Well, I helped him with
the pasta last time.

26:23.320 --> 26:24.844
- You did.
- Yeah, you did.

26:29.979 --> 26:32.416
I need, um,
oh, no, I'm good.

26:37.247 --> 26:39.162
I am right here.

26:40.555 --> 26:43.471
Grace is somebody
who is going to...

26:43.471 --> 26:44.951
not give you an A
in the beginning,

26:44.951 --> 26:46.387
and you gotta work
your way to an A.

26:46.387 --> 26:47.344
So...
- Yeah.

26:47.344 --> 26:48.519
He worked his way,
for sure.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.521
- Is he on an A?
- Maybe A-minus.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.436
Oh.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.047
Pull that up
a little bit,

26:54.047 --> 26:56.571
and, yeah, so you're-you're
pretty perfect, almost.

26:56.571 --> 26:57.659
Oh, okay.

26:57.659 --> 26:58.660
Angel, that one is
for you.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.183
All right.
Thank you, mom.

27:00.183 --> 27:01.837
See? It's pretty.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.317
- I was gonna ask you.
- What?

27:03.317 --> 27:05.275
If you wanted me to feed it
to you, but I guess--

27:05.275 --> 27:06.973
- I'm here.
- Please don't, please don't.

27:06.973 --> 27:08.844
Please-please don't.

27:08.844 --> 27:11.194
There is a child present.

27:11.194 --> 27:13.849
Look away.

27:13.849 --> 27:16.025
Disgusting. Bleh.

27:17.548 --> 27:19.942
Your next step, you need
to have my mom's breakfast.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.640
That's, like, top tier.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.945
Ooh, oh, what?

27:22.945 --> 27:24.860
But he's not
a breakfast guy.

27:24.860 --> 27:26.557
Angel, he doesn't really
like to eat breakfast.

27:26.557 --> 27:27.733
Who is telling you this?

27:27.733 --> 27:29.430
I've been with you
in the morning.

27:29.430 --> 27:31.171
Pancakes are
her specialty.

27:31.171 --> 27:33.564
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, so, the pancakes.

27:33.564 --> 27:34.870
What else?
Anything special?

27:34.870 --> 27:38.134
Pancakes,
waffles, brownies.

27:38.134 --> 27:39.570
- Ooh, what?
- Those are her specialties.

27:39.570 --> 27:40.833
These are
just plain brownies.

27:40.833 --> 27:44.227
These don't have
any extra additives in.

27:44.227 --> 27:45.576
You mean, like,
chocolate chips?

27:45.576 --> 27:48.101
Like chocolate chips.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.886
Sorry. Did I--

27:50.886 --> 27:52.758
Coming up next...

27:52.758 --> 27:54.673
Like, why is your husband
in the nail salon

27:54.673 --> 27:56.718
with a woman? Why?
- Right.

27:56.718 --> 27:58.328
And she-she told me
she doesn't care.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.635
- She doesn't care?
- But why doesn't she care?

28:00.635 --> 28:02.158
She needs
a support system.

28:02.158 --> 28:04.857
You do need to hear, like,
this is some bullsh--.

28:23.614 --> 28:25.791
- Oh, hey, babe.
- Hey, babe.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.880
- You made it, huh?
- I survived.

28:27.880 --> 28:29.620
We made it
through carpool.

28:29.620 --> 28:31.927
Have an amazing day.

28:31.927 --> 28:34.060
Are you really gonna
wear your tiara?

28:34.060 --> 28:36.062
Let everybody know
who is the princess.

28:36.062 --> 28:37.063
Why did you
lock the door?

28:37.063 --> 28:39.326
Reflex?
- Oh, my bad, yeah.

28:39.326 --> 28:40.849
I was thinking to myself,
oh, my gosh, like,

28:40.849 --> 28:42.503
you don't miss the house.

28:42.503 --> 28:44.897
Yeah, of course, I do.

28:44.897 --> 28:48.248
Moving out of the big house
has been quite, uh,

28:48.248 --> 28:50.816
an adjustment.

28:50.816 --> 28:53.993
Square footage wise,
we went from 10,000,

28:53.993 --> 28:58.127
almost 11,000, to 1,500.
Yeah, it's like a closet.

28:58.127 --> 28:59.825
Like, literally,
my old closet space

28:59.825 --> 29:02.828
is now my new living space, okay?

29:02.828 --> 29:05.395
Seriously.

29:05.395 --> 29:08.355
As far as cost is concerned,
we can no longer afford

29:08.355 --> 29:10.400
$10,000 a month,

29:10.400 --> 29:13.186
with everything that was
going on with our businesses.

29:13.186 --> 29:16.102
Mia, all of your businesses
were taken away

29:16.102 --> 29:19.583
from you and G by his brothers.

29:19.583 --> 29:22.586
We are literally
living off of our savings.

29:22.586 --> 29:26.155
Are you feeling okay
with all the bullsh--?

29:26.155 --> 29:28.723
Well, feeling better
because I'm resolved now

29:28.723 --> 29:30.551
as to what we need to do.

29:30.551 --> 29:31.987
I think, eventually,
it's gonna get to be

29:31.987 --> 29:33.684
a court case.
- Okay.

29:33.684 --> 29:35.861
I am not gonna walk away from
a half million dollars,

29:35.861 --> 29:38.733
which is what
the company owes me.

29:38.733 --> 29:41.867
Gordon and I
started developing

29:41.867 --> 29:44.565
The Joint Chiropractic in 2013.

29:44.565 --> 29:45.914
This is Dr. Lee.

29:45.914 --> 29:46.828
He's actually going to be
doing your adjustment.

29:46.828 --> 29:47.873
Hi.

29:47.873 --> 29:50.353
You might hear
some popping sounds.

29:50.353 --> 29:51.398
Ooh!

29:51.398 --> 29:52.921
Reminds me of when
I first met Ray.

29:52.921 --> 29:54.270
Oh.

29:54.270 --> 29:56.795
So, back in September,
Gordon was voted out of

29:56.795 --> 29:59.885
the family business, um,
for a reason that

29:59.885 --> 30:02.409
I'm still unsure of,
and I no longer work as

30:02.409 --> 30:04.541
the marketing director
for the company.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.021
Why are they acting
like this towards you?

30:06.021 --> 30:07.240
No idea.
I have no idea.

30:07.240 --> 30:08.719
All they said was that
I'm not listening,

30:08.719 --> 30:10.373
and that's it.

30:10.373 --> 30:12.898
It makes no sense to get rid of
a CEO who has done nothing.

30:12.898 --> 30:14.464
The revenues of
the company dropped,

30:14.464 --> 30:16.118
and the value went down immediately.

30:16.118 --> 30:17.467
It was stupid to do that.

30:17.467 --> 30:19.643
It has definitely put
a financial strain

30:19.643 --> 30:21.123
on our household.

30:21.123 --> 30:24.344
So, we need to figure out
how to replace that income,

30:24.344 --> 30:26.781
but I am most definitely
gonna figure out

30:26.781 --> 30:29.958
how to get back
and even better.

30:29.958 --> 30:31.786
I'll give ourselves
a pat on the back

30:31.786 --> 30:33.396
because we pivoted pretty quick,

30:33.396 --> 30:35.485
once we got through our two
or three months of woe is us,

30:35.485 --> 30:38.097
and did we
do anything wrong, and...

30:38.097 --> 30:39.489
Babe, you went through
a whole depression.

30:39.489 --> 30:41.317
Well-well, I went through
a depression. Yeah.

30:41.317 --> 30:43.406
You sat on that sofa
for two months.

30:43.406 --> 30:46.366
To see you like that, it was
really, really hard for me,

30:46.366 --> 30:47.758
and there were moments
that I was like--

30:47.758 --> 30:49.195
Mm-hmm.
Right.

30:49.195 --> 30:50.196
I know that, and I appreciate
you standing by me.

30:50.196 --> 30:50.979
- Yeah, it was so hard.
- Right.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.502
I knew it was hard.

30:52.502 --> 30:54.417
I didn't think I was gonna
make it through but then--

30:54.417 --> 30:55.766
And you cussed me out
a few times.

30:55.766 --> 30:57.812
I was gonna say then
I would go to being angry

30:57.812 --> 30:59.292
and cussing you out
and telling you

30:59.292 --> 31:00.859
to get the up
off your ass.

31:00.859 --> 31:03.078
Yeah, 'cause you thought
I had done somethin' wrong, too.

31:03.078 --> 31:05.124
Tell the truth.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

31:05.124 --> 31:07.126
I just didn't know.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.476
So, did the brothers
argue about how the money

31:09.476 --> 31:10.912
was being spent?
Was that the--

31:10.912 --> 31:12.305
- Hmm.
- No, that wasn't it at all.

31:12.305 --> 31:13.828
Because it looked very much

31:13.828 --> 31:15.438
like a little bit
of embezzlement.

31:15.438 --> 31:18.311
When we heard rumors
of an audit, you got concerned.

31:18.311 --> 31:21.096
I had the attorney and
the, uh, accountant

31:21.096 --> 31:23.316
in their office
do their own audit.

31:23.316 --> 31:24.534
- Yeah.
- I sent them everything,

31:24.534 --> 31:26.058
and they're going,
"Oh, things look clean."

31:26.058 --> 31:27.798
And the CPA said
the same thing.

31:27.798 --> 31:28.974
No, yeah, I know.

31:28.974 --> 31:29.844
So, okay, 'cause you
kept asking me,

31:29.844 --> 31:30.932
"What did you do?

31:30.932 --> 31:32.325
Are you sure you
didn't do anything?"

31:32.325 --> 31:33.456
Well, 'cause I gotta--
I gotta protect my assets.

31:33.456 --> 31:35.502
- Well, I understand.
- And my kids.

31:35.502 --> 31:40.028
I just think that, this year,
um, has been, like,

31:40.028 --> 31:43.858
a good year for me
even through adversity.

31:43.858 --> 31:46.992
There are some lifestyle changes
that I need to make

31:46.992 --> 31:49.690
in order to make sure
that I stay okay.

31:49.690 --> 31:51.126
Yeah.

31:51.126 --> 31:54.129
So, how do you feel about
me not drinking alcohol?

31:54.129 --> 31:57.654
I didn't know you weren't.

31:57.654 --> 31:59.352
- I thought I told you, babe.
- I don't think so.

31:59.352 --> 32:01.180
Because you, yeah,
because we were at the beach,

32:01.180 --> 32:02.703
and you were like,
"You want a cocktail?"

32:02.703 --> 32:04.052
And I was like, "Babe,
remember I'm not drinking."

32:04.052 --> 32:05.488
And you-- but you said--
right, but then you said

32:05.488 --> 32:07.012
you'll take a glass of wine,
which is still drinking.

32:07.012 --> 32:09.405
Okay, so, yes.
Okay, so, I'm drinking wine.

32:09.405 --> 32:10.754
Yes.

32:10.754 --> 32:11.799
There's the same amount
of alcohol in a cocktail

32:11.799 --> 32:13.018
and a beer.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.498
I decided to cut out
hard liquor

32:15.498 --> 32:19.198
because I felt like
it's mind and mood altering.

32:19.198 --> 32:22.288
And quite frankly,
I like who I am without it,

32:22.288 --> 32:24.072
so I don't need it.

32:24.072 --> 32:25.160
But why did you do it?

32:25.160 --> 32:26.509
Why did you make
that decision?

32:26.509 --> 32:28.816
I think about the last time
I had a cocktail.

32:28.816 --> 32:31.079
Um, I felt like--

32:31.079 --> 32:33.038
It was a little rocky
with Karen.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.909
I mean, it wasn't
necessarily rocky.

32:34.909 --> 32:36.128
I don't think.

32:36.128 --> 32:38.521
Someone is saying that
you went to Vegas,

32:38.521 --> 32:40.784
and you had sex with him
in the bathroom.

32:40.784 --> 32:44.919
So, my mouth is probably
a little bit more filtered,

32:44.919 --> 32:47.487
but I think it.

32:47.487 --> 32:49.532
But I don't know.
I need to check on her.

32:49.532 --> 32:50.664
I do.

32:50.664 --> 32:51.621
You think I should,
like, call her?

32:51.621 --> 32:52.622
Yeah, absolutely.

32:52.622 --> 32:53.928
Oh, God,
what am I gonna say?

32:53.928 --> 32:55.277
Absolutely.
I mean, you guys are friends.

32:55.277 --> 32:57.323
Sorry for calling you a ho.

32:57.323 --> 32:58.628
You didn't
call her a ho.

32:58.628 --> 33:04.417
Sorry for accusing you
of being a ho-ho-ho.

33:08.203 --> 33:09.683
Coming up...

33:09.683 --> 33:14.340
My joy has been taken,
but it's not Juan's fault.

33:14.340 --> 33:16.211
- Uh, it-it kinda is.
- It is.

33:16.211 --> 33:18.213
That's a
Juan moment, for sure.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.301
Okay, bring it on.

33:19.301 --> 33:21.434
I don't give a anymore.

33:33.402 --> 33:34.795
- It's good that you're home.
- Yes.

33:34.795 --> 33:36.362
I feel like I haven't
spent any time with you

33:36.362 --> 33:38.364
in the last six months.

33:38.364 --> 33:40.540
- Six?
- That's what it feels like.

33:40.540 --> 33:42.716
- It's like three.
- Four.

33:42.716 --> 33:44.718
Here, we're gonna go right
here, under this big,

33:44.718 --> 33:46.285
shady tree.
- Oh.

33:46.285 --> 33:49.288
Let's try that
blanket first.

33:49.288 --> 33:51.290
Oh, that'll work.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.901
That's just beautiful.
Look at that.

33:53.901 --> 33:55.163
Oh, man.

33:55.163 --> 33:58.036
Oh, my God.

33:58.036 --> 33:59.341
Lunch in the park,
how exciting.

33:59.341 --> 34:01.169
There's a lot of bugs.
I don't like it.

34:01.169 --> 34:03.084
Yeah, well,
this is what you get

34:03.084 --> 34:04.520
for wanting to be outside.

34:04.520 --> 34:07.567
Cheers to a-a day,
just us, hanging out.

34:07.567 --> 34:09.090
Yay.

34:09.090 --> 34:12.702
Last year was
the most challenging year

34:12.702 --> 34:13.790
in our marriage.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.618
Many a married man
have tried me,

34:15.618 --> 34:17.359
and I felt like
it was a situation

34:17.359 --> 34:19.231
in which he was trying to see
if I was with it.

34:19.231 --> 34:22.277
Chris DMed me
at 2:40 in the morning.

34:22.277 --> 34:23.452
My husband?

34:23.452 --> 34:27.195
He comes over
a little wanna, like--

34:27.195 --> 34:28.501
And he's smiling at you
in your face?

34:28.501 --> 34:30.546
Yeah, yes, the eyes.
Yeah, the eyes.

34:30.546 --> 34:32.722
Some of your actions
were just a little questionable.

34:32.722 --> 34:34.811
Man,
that sh--, Ashley. No.

34:34.811 --> 34:37.858
It's been a journey,
but we're able to have fun

34:37.858 --> 34:42.254
and not harp on our drama.

34:42.254 --> 34:45.779
- So, you glad to be home?
- Yes.

34:45.779 --> 34:50.610
It feels good to not be
living out of suitcases.

34:50.610 --> 34:51.741
Yeah.

34:51.741 --> 34:55.136
So, Nye sent me
a preliminary budget

34:55.136 --> 34:56.529
for the tour.
- Mm-hmm.

34:56.529 --> 34:59.227
And it's a lot of money.

34:59.227 --> 35:03.753
Like, just the band alone
is almost 50k,

35:03.753 --> 35:07.670
and then that doesn't include
everything else.

35:07.670 --> 35:10.499
I've been performing
the last three months.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.936
♪ It's about to be
a situation ♪

35:12.936 --> 35:15.548
♪ if I pull up
hanging out the Jeep ♪

35:15.548 --> 35:18.768
♪ with my day ones
and they turn up baby ♪

35:18.768 --> 35:21.554
Thank God for labels
that have marketing dollars

35:21.554 --> 35:23.425
to help with these things,

35:23.425 --> 35:27.168
but so much of touring
is on the artist,

35:27.168 --> 35:33.218
and I'm sure that
I spent over six figures

35:33.218 --> 35:35.829
to go on tour last year.

35:37.004 --> 35:40.138
And the goal is eventually
to make profit

35:40.138 --> 35:43.358
in the form of ticket sales,
in the form of merch,

35:43.358 --> 35:46.448
but I have to
go bigger this time.

35:46.448 --> 35:50.452
Costumes, hair, makeup,
wigs, highlights,

35:50.452 --> 35:55.501
chicken cutlets,
boob tape, titties--

35:55.501 --> 35:57.242
it's all gonna be there.

35:57.242 --> 35:58.721
So, get your tickets.

35:58.721 --> 36:00.636
First thing I'm gonna say is,
do you need dancers?

36:00.636 --> 36:03.291
Do you need a band?
- I'm not Alanis Morissette.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.553
I'm not Jewel.

36:04.553 --> 36:07.513
I don't have, like, a, like,
acoustic show

36:07.513 --> 36:09.906
where you're just waving
back and forth for an hour.

36:09.906 --> 36:11.299
I mean, the way
you're dressed today,

36:11.299 --> 36:14.302
you fit right in.

36:14.302 --> 36:15.564
Oh, man.

36:15.564 --> 36:18.611
- You should do Pilates.
- No.

36:18.611 --> 36:21.570
Well, you need to do something
'cause you're old.

36:21.570 --> 36:23.181
I go to the gym.
It's fine.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.486
You haven't
been to the gym.

36:24.486 --> 36:28.055
Yeah, like, not, like,
three weeks but whatever.

36:28.055 --> 36:29.752
I'll go back.
- Hmm.

36:29.752 --> 36:31.841
How was your, uh, visit
with Wendy and Karen

36:31.841 --> 36:33.278
the other day?

36:33.278 --> 36:36.063
I mean, we all have
a lot of opinions on Robyn.

36:36.063 --> 36:37.282
Mm-hmm.

36:37.282 --> 36:41.111
I don't understand
why Robyn would think

36:41.111 --> 36:45.159
that it's okay to go along
with these lies about you

36:45.159 --> 36:51.687
when she has a true scandal
happening with her husband.

36:51.687 --> 36:56.083
So, I acknowledge that
Robyn was supportive.

36:56.083 --> 37:01.219
Where it starts to get muddy,
is when I am seeing her

37:01.219 --> 37:08.051
in other situations
where she's not so passionate.

37:08.051 --> 37:10.750
Can we agree that
it probably is not the best idea

37:10.750 --> 37:13.274
for a married man
to be in a hotel room

37:13.274 --> 37:14.710
with a single woman?

37:14.710 --> 37:18.584
Thinking about how she moved
on that whole story

37:18.584 --> 37:21.717
about you being a sneaky link,
it just makes me sit back

37:21.717 --> 37:27.245
and say, were you
only supporting me and Chris

37:27.245 --> 37:30.552
so that no one would bring up
what was happening

37:30.552 --> 37:32.075
with you
and your husband?

37:32.075 --> 37:34.904
If you were to approach her,
um, or just say,

37:34.904 --> 37:36.558
"Hey, I-I-I'd
like to talk.

37:36.558 --> 37:38.125
I don't know where
we went wrong."

37:38.125 --> 37:40.910
But it's piled on, right,
over the last couple of months.

37:40.910 --> 37:42.347
Yes, yeah.

37:42.347 --> 37:44.566
But I still think you guys
have the opportunity.

37:44.566 --> 37:48.614
Robyn has always been
one of my home girls.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.703
I don't like
having contention.

37:50.703 --> 37:54.141
So, I'm really open
to talking to her.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.797
Oh, man.
Oh, got it.

37:57.797 --> 38:00.190
Ooh, you're turning
white people red.

38:00.190 --> 38:03.193
- It's hard out here.
- My God.

38:13.421 --> 38:19.297
I am treating
the ladies nice today.

38:19.297 --> 38:23.431
I will let Charrisse open this.

38:23.431 --> 38:26.826
- Surprise!
- Oh, yes!

38:26.826 --> 38:29.481
Charrisse is in the building.
- My surprise for-- thank you.

38:29.481 --> 38:31.309
You did not have to
do all this for me.

38:31.309 --> 38:33.441
I am serious.
You really did not.

38:33.441 --> 38:35.400
Aww, welcome.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.010
Thank you for
having me, love.

38:37.010 --> 38:39.795
So, because of you, I,
of course, I this here.

38:39.795 --> 38:41.362
Yes, thank you.
That's definitely me.

38:41.362 --> 38:43.451
Yes, and I will let you,
like, open it and do all that

38:43.451 --> 38:44.713
'cause this is--
you know,

38:44.713 --> 38:46.019
I would have my butler
here for you,

38:46.019 --> 38:50.284
but I gave him the day off.

38:50.284 --> 38:51.633
Okay, we're gonna--

38:51.633 --> 38:52.330
hopefully, Ashley will get here
before Robyn.

38:52.330 --> 38:53.461
Right.

38:53.461 --> 38:54.984
We're about to give her
some tough love.

38:54.984 --> 38:56.595
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

38:56.595 --> 38:57.944
- I'm scared.
- Okay.

38:57.944 --> 39:00.903
'Cause I don't know
how she is gonna react.

39:00.903 --> 39:03.384
Neither do I.
Here comes the Ash bash.

39:03.384 --> 39:04.646
Oh, hey.

39:04.646 --> 39:06.344
I'm going down
the slip and slide.

39:06.344 --> 39:09.695
- Hey, Ashley.
- Oh, hi, babe.

39:09.695 --> 39:13.525
Hotel Gizelle is always
under construction.

39:19.531 --> 39:21.402
Somethin' is always broken.

39:21.402 --> 39:23.665
Somethin' always needs
some paving,

39:23.665 --> 39:26.102
some trimming,
some demolishing.

39:26.102 --> 39:28.627
When is my girl gonna have
a completion date, okay?

39:28.627 --> 39:31.064
Because if I break an ankle
or break a toe,

39:31.064 --> 39:32.065
like, she is done.

39:32.065 --> 39:34.241
We're gonna be
in trouble, okay?

39:34.241 --> 39:35.634
Hi, babe.
- Hi. Muah.

39:35.634 --> 39:36.896
Good to see you.
- How are you?

39:36.896 --> 39:37.810
Great to see you, too. Hi.
- Is this for me?

39:37.810 --> 39:39.202
- Yes.
- Thank you so much.

39:39.202 --> 39:40.856
Yes, of course.
Thank you for having us.

39:40.856 --> 39:41.944
Okay, y'all sit down.
I'm gonna get you--

39:41.944 --> 39:43.076
- Okay, we're sitting. Yes.
- Yes.

39:43.076 --> 39:44.382
Okay, where is Robyn
sitting exactly?

39:44.382 --> 39:45.687
We'll put her over there. Okay.

39:45.687 --> 39:47.602
Yes, I'm-I'm
gonna sit here.

39:47.602 --> 39:48.821
Okay.
Okay, that's good.

39:48.821 --> 39:50.257
Is Robyn on her way?
Did you talk to her?

39:50.257 --> 39:51.911
She's on her way. Okay.

39:51.911 --> 39:54.304
And we're gonna talk to her
about our concerns and feelings.

39:54.304 --> 39:55.393
Yes. Right.

39:55.393 --> 39:56.698
As her girlfriends.

39:56.698 --> 40:00.136
And we've all been
in a similar situation.

40:00.136 --> 40:01.442
- Yes.
- Right.

40:01.442 --> 40:03.836
But I do think there is, like,
some delusion

40:03.836 --> 40:07.970
with what's really
going on in her life.

40:07.970 --> 40:10.886
I know that Ashley
and Charrisse

40:10.886 --> 40:14.455
have been through similar things
in their marriages,

40:14.455 --> 40:17.545
so these are the best two people
to come and really talk to her

40:17.545 --> 40:20.722
and tell her,
hey, you got us.

40:20.722 --> 40:22.420
We are here to love you.

40:22.420 --> 40:27.729
When I saw the picture of Juan
with the girl in the nail salon,

40:27.729 --> 40:29.905
I screamed, and yelled,
and went off.

40:29.905 --> 40:32.342
Like, why is your husband
in the nail salon with a woman?

40:32.342 --> 40:33.735
Why?
- Right.

40:33.735 --> 40:35.302
And she-she told me
she doesn't care.

40:35.302 --> 40:37.696
- She doesn't care?
- But why doesn't she care?

40:37.696 --> 40:40.046
She-- I think she said
she was numb to it.

40:40.046 --> 40:41.700
She said somethin' crazy.
- Maybe she's used to it.

40:41.700 --> 40:42.875
And this is not
the first time.

40:42.875 --> 40:44.703
It's just, like,
a repeated thing

40:44.703 --> 40:46.444
that she's learned to deal with.
- Right.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.576
This is like her normal now.

40:48.576 --> 40:50.404
- How terrible is that?
- I agree.

40:52.798 --> 40:56.628
No, but a lot of
people live like that.

40:56.628 --> 40:59.152
- We too old for all of that.
- I hear you.

40:59.152 --> 41:00.588
Life is short.

41:00.588 --> 41:01.937
So, that's why I was saying,
is it denial?

41:01.937 --> 41:03.591
Is it delusion?
What is it?

41:03.591 --> 41:04.940
She's upset,
and she's hurt.

41:04.940 --> 41:07.160
Like, she needs
a support system.

41:07.160 --> 41:09.336
You do need to hear, like,
this is some bullsh--.

41:19.607 --> 41:21.348
Is it denial?
Is it delusion?

41:21.348 --> 41:22.349
What is it?

41:22.349 --> 41:23.393
She's upset,
and she's hurt.

41:23.393 --> 41:25.439
Like, she needs
a support system.

41:25.439 --> 41:28.398
You do need to hear, like,
this is some bullsh--.

41:28.398 --> 41:31.837
What are you thinking?
- Are you serious?

41:31.837 --> 41:33.969
I'm not trying to
bust my ass here.

41:33.969 --> 41:36.972
Oh, yeah.
Walk backwards. It helps.

41:36.972 --> 41:38.408
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

41:38.408 --> 41:40.019
- Too late.
- And look how cute you look.

41:40.019 --> 41:42.195
You need, like, steps.
They need to be steps.

41:42.195 --> 41:43.718
- Steps, exactly.
- Steps? Okay.

41:43.718 --> 41:44.763
- Yeah.
- Yes.

41:44.763 --> 41:46.416
Whatever you want,
Robyn Dixon.

41:46.416 --> 41:49.550
Okay, I was nervous. Hi.

41:49.550 --> 41:51.204
- How are you?
- Look at you. I'm good.

41:51.204 --> 41:52.771
- Good, good, good.
- Oh, look at you.

41:52.771 --> 41:54.816
You've been working out.
- Hi. How are you?

41:54.816 --> 41:55.991
I know she has been--
you have been working out.

41:55.991 --> 41:57.297
- Look at you.
- No, I haven't.

41:57.297 --> 41:58.211
- Yes, you have.
- You've been doin' somethin'.

41:58.211 --> 41:59.212
- Somethin'.
- Not really.

41:59.212 --> 42:01.431
Hi.
- What? You got the Bahamas tan.

42:01.431 --> 42:03.042
- How are you?
- Good.

42:03.042 --> 42:04.391
What would you like
to drink?

42:04.391 --> 42:05.087
We have some spritzers.
- I'll have champagne.

42:05.087 --> 42:06.132
You want champagne.

42:06.132 --> 42:07.002
- Yeah, sure.
- What about the--

42:07.002 --> 42:08.351
I know you like
the rosé,

42:08.351 --> 42:10.353
Um, uh, this is open.

42:10.353 --> 42:11.572
I'll just have that.
- Champagne? Okay.

42:11.572 --> 42:12.878
- Yeah.
- Okay, but you--

42:12.878 --> 42:13.922
you're our special guest.

42:13.922 --> 42:14.923
So, I can open up
a bottle for you.

42:14.923 --> 42:16.011
- I'm your special guest?
- Yes.

42:16.011 --> 42:17.752
- Why?
- Have a seat, Robyn.

42:17.752 --> 42:19.319
- You didn't-- I didn't--
- 'Cause we love you.

42:19.319 --> 42:20.755
You didn't tell me that.
You just told me to come over.

42:20.755 --> 42:23.236
Okay, all right.

42:23.236 --> 42:24.933
The three of us,
you know, love you,

42:24.933 --> 42:26.935
100%.
- Uh-huh, yeah.

42:26.935 --> 42:28.502
And so, this is, like,
a little tough love,

42:28.502 --> 42:29.764
a little bit.
- Tough love?

42:29.764 --> 42:30.809
Damn, what'd I do?
- Yes.

42:30.809 --> 42:32.593
Okay, let me just start
by saying

42:32.593 --> 42:34.334
I talked to these two...
- Mm-hmm.

42:34.334 --> 42:35.640
Because I know that
they also love you.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.598
We are here to support you--
- Mm-hmm.

42:37.598 --> 42:39.121
As it relates to Juan.

42:39.121 --> 42:41.907
So, this is just
an open forum to talk.

42:46.520 --> 42:48.435
Okay, go ahead.

42:48.435 --> 42:49.784
I don't have anything
planned to say, right now.

42:49.784 --> 42:51.699
Okay, did you have
something to say?

42:53.048 --> 42:54.963
When those things broke,
like when the story

42:54.963 --> 42:56.791
about the hotel came out--
- Right.

42:56.791 --> 42:58.097
And all of that,
you know,

42:58.097 --> 42:59.577
I had messaged you
that night,

42:59.577 --> 43:01.622
and I was like, "Robyn,
I-I know this is ludicrous,"

43:01.622 --> 43:02.884
da, da, da, da, da.

43:02.884 --> 43:04.582
And then as more things
starting coming out,

43:04.582 --> 43:06.845
there started being some things
that sounded a little fishier.

43:06.845 --> 43:09.325
And I was like,
did Robyn tell me the truth?

43:09.325 --> 43:11.806
I-I wasn't sure if you were
being honest with me,

43:11.806 --> 43:13.808
or if you were even
being honest with you.

43:13.808 --> 43:15.157
Mm-hmm.

43:15.157 --> 43:17.290
And then when the nail salon
photo came out...

43:17.290 --> 43:20.554
I got really upset for you.

43:20.554 --> 43:21.773
- Mm-hmm.
- Because I'm like,

43:21.773 --> 43:23.775
I've been in that position
where, you know,

43:23.775 --> 43:25.646
you have to, like, defend
your relationship,

43:25.646 --> 43:28.693
and that just-- I-- it's not
a comfortable place to be.

43:28.693 --> 43:30.129
All right.
Let me, okay, let me--

43:30.129 --> 43:31.957
let me just explain
some things.

43:31.957 --> 43:33.393
- Okay.
- Yeah.

43:33.393 --> 43:36.701
Okay. Ashley, Breanna has
worked on Juan's staff

43:36.701 --> 43:38.006
for over--
for three years.

43:38.006 --> 43:41.314
So, that relationship
is not new to me.

43:41.314 --> 43:44.143
Now, the laundromat story
was a straight lie,

43:44.143 --> 43:47.276
and that's the thing
that is really unfortunate

43:47.276 --> 43:51.237
that people are out here
putting out blatant lies

43:51.237 --> 43:53.456
when they say, "Oh,
they were hugged up,

43:53.456 --> 43:54.675
putting stuff
in the washing machine."

43:54.675 --> 43:55.981
That didn't happen.

43:55.981 --> 43:57.547
Although Juan was not
smart in communicating

43:57.547 --> 43:59.898
with the female
in Canada,

43:59.898 --> 44:03.162
he's not dumb enough to be
anywhere in public

44:03.162 --> 44:09.124
being affectionate and physical
with another woman.

44:09.124 --> 44:10.996
So, for me,
the two incidents

44:10.996 --> 44:12.867
you say are
two distinct things.

44:12.867 --> 44:14.216
So, I think that the thing
that happened

44:14.216 --> 44:16.697
with the girl from Canada
is a different situation

44:16.697 --> 44:18.090
than the coach.
- Right.

44:18.090 --> 44:21.136
As far as with Coach Bre,
I think it's more so

44:21.136 --> 44:23.878
the sensitivity
of the optics.

44:23.878 --> 44:26.228
And if I were Juan,
I would probably operate

44:26.228 --> 44:30.319
a little bit more cognizant
or aware of what's happening

44:30.319 --> 44:31.712
just for a minute,
you know.

44:31.712 --> 44:34.019
Literally, I told him,
I'm like-- he's telling me,

44:34.019 --> 44:35.063
"Oh, I'm going
to the nail salon.

44:35.063 --> 44:36.108
Bre is gonna come by
and say hi."

44:36.108 --> 44:37.022
I'm like,
"Juan, the block is hot."

44:37.022 --> 44:38.676
And he's like,
"Okay, whatever.

44:38.676 --> 44:40.808
Like, am I supposed to just,
like, sit in the house?"

44:40.808 --> 44:42.201
Yes, because he made
the mistake

44:42.201 --> 44:44.159
back with-with the hotel.
- Yes, yes.

44:44.159 --> 44:46.640
No, I-- but I'm-- see, that--
it's just-- I don't--

44:46.640 --> 44:48.076
Yes, he's not thinking,

44:48.076 --> 44:50.513
"How is this
going to affect Robyn?"

44:50.513 --> 44:51.950
All right. So, what do
y'all want me to do?

44:51.950 --> 44:54.039
Get mad at him, and scream,
and throw a shoe at him?

44:54.039 --> 44:55.344
"Oh, my God, I can't
believe you went

44:55.344 --> 44:56.911
to the nail salon
with Breanna.

44:56.911 --> 44:58.434
Oh, my God, how
could you do that?"

44:58.434 --> 45:00.349
Like, is that what
you want me to do?

45:00.349 --> 45:04.353
He is not thinking
about you,

45:04.353 --> 45:07.487
saying, "You know what?
This is bad optics."

45:09.141 --> 45:11.273
I'm not going to tell him
to end his friendship.

45:11.273 --> 45:14.102
I'm not going to tell him,
oh, you can't do

45:14.102 --> 45:17.062
certain things
that were fine before.

45:17.062 --> 45:18.498
At this point,
I don't care.

45:18.498 --> 45:19.934
- Robyn.
- I don't.

45:19.934 --> 45:22.632
We're just talking
about you,

45:22.632 --> 45:24.373
your happiness,
your joy.

45:24.373 --> 45:25.374
Are you good?

45:29.074 --> 45:32.077
My joy has been stolen

45:32.077 --> 45:37.343
because of all of the sh--
that has piled on nonstop.

45:37.343 --> 45:39.301
Every other day,
it's a headline.

45:39.301 --> 45:43.566
But there's one person
at the center of it.

45:43.566 --> 45:45.090
What do you want me to do,
Gizelle?

45:45.090 --> 45:46.221
I don't--
no, no, no.

45:46.221 --> 45:47.788
I just want you
to be happy.

45:47.788 --> 45:49.268
I want you to live
your best life.

45:49.268 --> 45:51.096
I'm-I'm--
this is the thing.

45:51.096 --> 45:54.752
The world wants to
tear us apart, right?

45:54.752 --> 45:59.495
And yes, my joy has been taken,
but it's not Juan's fault.

46:02.194 --> 46:03.673
- Uh, it-it kinda is.
- It is.

46:03.673 --> 46:05.153
It's Juan's fault.

46:05.153 --> 46:06.459
- His actions are determining--
- It's Juan's fault.

46:06.459 --> 46:08.113
Juan was in the nail salon.
- Okay, take away--

46:08.113 --> 46:09.592
- Juan was in the laundromat.
- Take away the fact that we--

46:09.592 --> 46:11.594
- Juan was at the hotel.
- Okay, bring it on.

46:11.594 --> 46:12.813
You know what I'm saying?
Like, just bring it on.

46:12.813 --> 46:15.816
I don't give a anymore.

46:15.816 --> 46:18.645
You don't have to act like
this isn't bothering you.

46:18.645 --> 46:21.561
The world has come after you
as it relates to Juan.

46:21.561 --> 46:23.737
I don't give a .
Pile it on.

46:23.737 --> 46:26.392
They've already stole my joy.
Just keep beating me up.

46:26.392 --> 46:27.697
Do you feel like
we have your back?

46:27.697 --> 46:30.091
'Cause-'cause we're here today
because we do.

46:30.091 --> 46:32.702
All of this has been
a pile on,

46:32.702 --> 46:35.662
and this is cruel.

46:41.755 --> 46:43.670
It's Juan's fault.

46:43.670 --> 46:46.412
The world has come after you
as it relates to Juan.

46:46.412 --> 46:48.457
I don't give a .
Pile it on.

46:48.457 --> 46:51.069
They've already stole my joy.
Just keep beating me up.

46:51.069 --> 46:52.766
Do you feel like
we have your back?

46:52.766 --> 46:54.855
'Cause-'cause we're here today
because we do.

46:54.855 --> 46:57.249
All of this has been
a pile on,

46:57.249 --> 46:59.729
and this is cruel.

47:01.949 --> 47:03.821
Take the world
out of the equation.

47:03.821 --> 47:06.127
He should not be out in public
with other women, period.

47:06.127 --> 47:07.302
I just--

47:07.302 --> 47:09.609
So, if Breanna was big,
fat, and ugly,

47:09.609 --> 47:11.002
would you care?

47:11.002 --> 47:12.873
My ex got to have
some bogus honey,

47:12.873 --> 47:15.267
so I would have never thought
he would have stuck his thing

47:15.267 --> 47:17.835
in those thangs,
and he did, okay?

47:17.835 --> 47:19.967
I went through years

47:19.967 --> 47:25.233
of my ex being in
various relationships,

47:25.233 --> 47:29.411
and, honestly,
and I-- and I think...

47:35.330 --> 47:38.638
I didn't wanna do this.
My heart hurts for you

47:38.638 --> 47:41.467
because it opens up
a wound for me.

47:41.467 --> 47:45.732
And I'm not saying your
situation is my situation,

47:45.732 --> 47:49.954
but it looks so familiar.

47:49.954 --> 47:52.260
I gave Eddie
1,000 passes,

47:52.260 --> 47:53.827
1,000 excuses, everything.

47:53.827 --> 47:56.177
And at the end of the day,
I knew the truth.

47:56.177 --> 47:58.963
I'm not really sure what's
going on in my marriage.

47:58.963 --> 48:00.094
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

48:00.094 --> 48:01.226
- Hmm.
- Um,

48:01.226 --> 48:03.663
we're just at one
of those crossroads,

48:03.663 --> 48:06.187
and this has been going on
actually for, like, three years.

48:06.187 --> 48:07.014
So, it's not like--
- Oh, hell no.

48:07.014 --> 48:08.189
Charrisse.

48:11.323 --> 48:12.498
I didn't wanna
accept the truth.

48:12.498 --> 48:14.152
I made excuses
for everything.

48:14.152 --> 48:16.589
And this guy
decided one day

48:16.589 --> 48:18.852
to just walk out
the----ing door

48:18.852 --> 48:20.462
after everything
that I did,

48:20.462 --> 48:25.206
and I just don't want
that for you.

48:25.206 --> 48:28.035
So, are you saying
that I'm in denial,

48:28.035 --> 48:29.210
or I'm making excuses for that?
- I don't-- I don't--

48:29.210 --> 48:30.646
I don't know.

48:30.646 --> 48:32.170
If you go back to
the other situation

48:32.170 --> 48:34.346
with the girl
from Canada,

48:34.346 --> 48:36.652
to me, yeah,
I kinda feel that vibe,

48:36.652 --> 48:40.569
the-- of you being
in denial about that.

48:40.569 --> 48:44.051
Watching you on that show
out of New York,

48:44.051 --> 48:46.358
I was like,
oh, my God.

48:46.358 --> 48:47.968
Did he show you
their correspondence?

48:47.968 --> 48:49.578
He didn't show me.
No, I didn't really ask

48:49.578 --> 48:51.580
because I just
trusted, like,

48:51.580 --> 48:54.453
that what is telling me
is the truth.

48:54.453 --> 48:57.108
It just made my heart
bleed for you.

48:57.108 --> 48:58.674
Mm-hmm.

48:58.674 --> 49:00.328
You know, Robyn, it's just
like when I came to the barn

49:00.328 --> 49:02.200
after things happened
in my situation,

49:02.200 --> 49:04.028
and I was, like, telling
everybody what happened,

49:04.028 --> 49:06.030
and I-I made
a lot of excuses.

49:06.030 --> 49:08.467
One of these women said,
"Do you want to go have some fun

49:08.467 --> 49:10.208
in a hotel?"
He took the bait.

49:10.208 --> 49:12.471
He was so drunk

49:12.471 --> 49:15.039
that he laid down--
- Okay.

49:15.039 --> 49:16.431
And went to sleep.

49:16.431 --> 49:18.520
I did blame myself.
You know, I was postpartum,

49:18.520 --> 49:20.348
and I wasn't
giving him affection

49:20.348 --> 49:21.697
and all of that.
- Yeah.

49:21.697 --> 49:23.743
But ultimately,
I hit a boiling point.

49:23.743 --> 49:26.180
And I know we are
different people,

49:26.180 --> 49:28.269
but I just don't feel,

49:28.269 --> 49:30.184
knowing you for
this many years now,

49:30.184 --> 49:32.012
like-like you're happy.

49:32.012 --> 49:33.013
What do you mean?

49:33.013 --> 49:34.406
Like, this--
this really feels

49:34.406 --> 49:36.408
like this is
a protect Juan campaign.

49:36.408 --> 49:37.931
It's not.

49:37.931 --> 49:41.935
Listen, the woman in Canada,
the story is crazy, right?

49:41.935 --> 49:43.067
Yes.

49:43.067 --> 49:44.546
He would not make up
a crazy story.

49:44.546 --> 49:47.506
He would actually make up
a better story.

49:47.506 --> 49:50.204
Juan was still
communicating with her.

49:50.204 --> 49:51.945
Uh, yeah,
that's the problem.

49:51.945 --> 49:54.078
He-he should not have been
communicating with her.

49:54.078 --> 49:55.427
That's the problem.
- Okay.

49:55.427 --> 49:56.776
So, you're making him
accountable for that.

49:56.776 --> 49:59.170
Uh, we dealt
with it, right?

49:59.170 --> 50:01.389
- Right.
- I found out. I was angry.

50:01.389 --> 50:02.956
I told him to get
the out.

50:02.956 --> 50:05.089
We worked through it.
- Okay, wait, pause.

50:05.089 --> 50:06.568
When you told him to get
the out, did he leave?

50:06.568 --> 50:08.614
- No.
- Did you pack his bags?

50:08.614 --> 50:11.051
No, I mean, it was just--
I was-- it's just like no, no.

50:11.051 --> 50:12.792
Oh, okay, but would
you ever put him out?

50:12.792 --> 50:14.272
If there was another
hotel receipt,

50:14.272 --> 50:15.664
if there was another incident,

50:15.664 --> 50:17.101
would you put him out?
- Yes.

50:17.101 --> 50:19.451
Yeah, we--
that's it.

50:19.451 --> 50:20.278
- Okay.
- Oh, you would?

50:20.278 --> 50:21.409
Yes.

50:21.409 --> 50:23.150
'Cause I've-I've been
feeling like

50:23.150 --> 50:26.240
there's nothing that he will do
that you will feel like,

50:26.240 --> 50:28.329
"you know what?
You need to go."

50:28.329 --> 50:30.201
Because some women
just turn a blind eye.

50:30.201 --> 50:31.680
You want it to work,

50:31.680 --> 50:33.769
and so you'll put up
with a lotta sh--.

50:33.769 --> 50:35.423
Especially
the second time around.

50:35.423 --> 50:38.078
But in all of that,
you lose yourself,

50:38.078 --> 50:39.558
and you know my story.

50:39.558 --> 50:40.907
I was married
to Jamal Bryant.

50:40.907 --> 50:44.476
Jamal was a cheater,
cheater, pumpkin eater.

50:44.476 --> 50:46.130
The woman that
he was sleeping with

50:46.130 --> 50:47.870
very much told me.

50:47.870 --> 50:51.309
Um, so, for me,
it was an automatic, like,

50:51.309 --> 50:53.702
no, I'm not living
this life.

50:53.702 --> 50:57.184
I'm now a very grown,
mature woman,

50:57.184 --> 50:59.839
and I am at a place
in my life

50:59.839 --> 51:03.625
where I'm always gonna put
me first, not Jamal,

51:03.625 --> 51:08.413
not any other dude,
because I didn't for so long.

51:08.413 --> 51:11.807
And I don't want you
to ever lose sight of you.

51:11.807 --> 51:14.332
I remember when you guys
got divorced.

51:14.332 --> 51:16.595
I know the woman
you were then.

51:16.595 --> 51:18.075
You're-you're
a different woman today.

51:18.075 --> 51:19.380
Right.
Yeah, for sure.

51:19.380 --> 51:21.295
I always want you
to put that woman first.

51:21.295 --> 51:22.427
Respect that woman.

51:22.427 --> 51:24.168
Make sure he's respecting
that woman,

51:24.168 --> 51:28.041
'cause that woman
can get beat down.

51:28.041 --> 51:31.566
Juan, I think, makes up
crazy, unbelievable stories

51:31.566 --> 51:32.915
so that Robyn can say,

51:32.915 --> 51:35.527
"This is so crazy
it's gotta be true."

51:35.527 --> 51:38.051
Whatever Juan tells her,
she believes.

51:38.051 --> 51:39.357
I don't believe it,

51:39.357 --> 51:40.619
but it doesn't matter
what I believe.

51:40.619 --> 51:42.316
It matter
what Robyn believes.

51:42.316 --> 51:44.362
I can tell Robyn until
I'm blue in the face

51:44.362 --> 51:45.841
that I don't think
the story is real,

51:45.841 --> 51:48.148
but if Robyn believes it,
which is really

51:48.148 --> 51:50.455
all that matters,
then so be it.

51:50.455 --> 51:53.371
I know what denial looks like
'cause I lived it.

51:53.371 --> 51:54.763
I lived
the basketball life,

51:54.763 --> 51:58.376
so I know what goes on
in those hotels, okay?

51:58.376 --> 52:01.205
So, hmm,
not believing it.

52:01.205 --> 52:04.730
I just feel like you seem
a little defensive, right now.

52:04.730 --> 52:06.253
I'm not being defensive.

52:06.253 --> 52:08.995
I think I'm not saying stuff
that you all want to hear.

52:08.995 --> 52:10.083
I think you want--

52:10.083 --> 52:11.476
What do you think
we wanna hear?

52:11.476 --> 52:12.825
" Juan. I can't believe
he did that sh--."

52:12.825 --> 52:14.131
- No, no, no.
- No, absolutely not.

52:14.131 --> 52:15.523
I am not
on that team.

52:15.523 --> 52:17.221
- Like, yeah, so--
- I'm okay with you saying that.

52:17.221 --> 52:19.223
I am.
- She's like, "I'm okay."

52:19.223 --> 52:20.441
I'm gonna be honest.

52:20.441 --> 52:21.877
That's a " Juan" moment,
for sure.

52:21.877 --> 52:24.576
Okay, and-and that was
three weeks ago.

52:24.576 --> 52:25.838
You still want me
to be mad?

52:25.838 --> 52:27.144
You want me walking
around angry?

52:27.144 --> 52:28.580
- No, I don't want--
- You want me to divorce?

52:28.580 --> 52:29.407
I don't want--
- Like, what do you

52:29.407 --> 52:30.538
want me to do?
- No.

52:30.538 --> 52:32.018
What do you wanna do?
- No, I-I'm--

52:32.018 --> 52:33.367
What does Robyn do?

52:33.367 --> 52:35.848
I wanna keep living
and-and get through this.

52:35.848 --> 52:38.590
Okay. I do want you
to feel comfortable

52:38.590 --> 52:40.635
knowing you've got
some friends

52:40.635 --> 52:42.811
that love you
and care about you.

52:42.811 --> 52:44.465
We wanna support you.
- Right.

52:44.465 --> 52:45.901
Whether you wanna
admit it or not,

52:45.901 --> 52:47.947
you've been through a lot,
and we're here for you.

52:47.947 --> 52:49.253
- Yeah.
- 100%.

52:49.253 --> 52:50.558
Yeah,
I appreciate y'all.

52:50.558 --> 52:53.126
I appreciate your hard truth,
your opinions,

52:53.126 --> 52:54.475
all of that.

52:54.475 --> 52:56.999
We're going to continue
to live our lives, and

52:56.999 --> 52:59.872
whether people judge
or speculate,

52:59.872 --> 53:02.962
that's on them.
That's what it is.

53:02.962 --> 53:04.485
I am okay.

53:04.485 --> 53:07.836
It's just been a lot, you know.
- Yeah, it is.

53:07.836 --> 53:10.970
Robyn lives life
according to Juan,

53:10.970 --> 53:12.885
but Robyn and I
are very close,

53:12.885 --> 53:15.627
and I've been
feeling her pain,

53:15.627 --> 53:18.456
and I feel like
one day

53:18.456 --> 53:19.979
it'll bubble up

53:19.979 --> 53:22.634
and explode.

53:22.634 --> 53:25.376
But I-I do believe that,
you know,

53:25.376 --> 53:28.988
there are better things
coming. So...

53:28.988 --> 53:30.642
I pray.

53:30.642 --> 53:32.034
We got nowhere
to go but up.

53:36.125 --> 53:37.997
Next time, on "The
Real Housewives of Potomac."

53:37.997 --> 53:39.825
Ladies, this is
my friend, Nneka.

53:39.825 --> 53:41.479
You guys actually have
a lot in common.

53:41.479 --> 53:43.307
- Okay, tell me.
- She's Igbo, as well.

53:43.307 --> 53:45.178
I talked about it
with Nneka.

53:45.178 --> 53:47.006
There was this article
about you being, like,

53:47.006 --> 53:48.529
Osu or something.

53:48.529 --> 53:51.880
She basically was like,
"Oh, Osu is, like, terrible."

53:55.232 --> 53:57.321
- Hi.
- Oh, hi, Robyn!

53:57.321 --> 53:58.235
Hey.

54:02.717 --> 54:04.632
If you got somethin' to say,
then say it.
