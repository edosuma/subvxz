WEBVTT

01:25.043 --> 01:26.920
I don't even know where to start.

01:29.173 --> 01:30.215
The beginning?

01:33.677 --> 01:37.181
Look, I get it. My first client,
he was skeptical too.

01:37.264 --> 01:39.850
But now his money's triple.

01:40.851 --> 01:41.852
Thank you.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.813
Everyone's so focused
on instant gratification.

01:44.897 --> 01:47.024
No one's thinking about the long game.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.317
- Makes sense.
- Right.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.028
But I think I'm gonna stick
with the people

01:51.111 --> 01:52.946
that are making me money now.

01:53.030 --> 01:55.866
Hey, wait. Come on.
We've just opened the wine.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.993
I mean, at least stay for a glass.

01:58.076 --> 02:01.079
Call me in a couple of months.
Thanks for the steak.

02:01.163 --> 02:02.164
Of course.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.424
Can I get you anything else?

02:14.718 --> 02:16.386
How much was the wine again?

02:17.721 --> 02:21.433
I think it was 300. Sorry, I'm new here.

02:21.517 --> 02:23.602
No problem. Just the check.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.354
Be right back.

02:37.533 --> 02:38.951
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.787
What was your meeting about?

02:43.664 --> 02:47.125
I'm a partner
at a venture capital firm downtown.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.378
So, that guy was a prospective client.

02:50.045 --> 02:51.296
Well, his loss.

02:52.965 --> 02:56.593
And you were right, by the way.
It is all about the long game.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.096
Most people are just complacent.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.098
Yeah, exactly.

03:01.181 --> 03:05.602
But if you're too afraid to take a risk,
life just continues on, doesn't it?

03:05.686 --> 03:06.937
Nothing ever changes.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.318
Sorry. I'll be back for your bill.

03:13.402 --> 03:18.115
Or you-- I mean, you could stay
and help me finish the wine.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.202
I don't even like red,
so it'd be wasted on me.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.699
Wow. Nice place.

04:02.659 --> 04:05.162
Yeah, the neighborhood's on the rise,

04:05.245 --> 04:07.289
but I got in early, so…

04:08.916 --> 04:13.795
You want something to eat? Or…

04:15.714 --> 04:16.923
I'm okay.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.007
Yeah?

04:19.301 --> 04:20.677
Mind if I use the restroom?

04:20.761 --> 04:21.762
Sure.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.556
Where is it?

04:25.974 --> 04:27.809
It's down the hall.

04:32.814 --> 04:33.815
Fuck.

04:35.567 --> 04:36.652
Okay.

04:58.090 --> 05:00.551
What's it like
living in a place like this?

05:00.634 --> 05:03.303
I mean, waking up to that view
every morning,

05:03.387 --> 05:06.306
watching your cares
melt away with the fog.

05:06.390 --> 05:09.017
You can see the water, if--

05:09.101 --> 05:11.103
If only this was actually your house.

05:13.856 --> 05:16.191
You didn't know where the restroom was.

05:16.275 --> 05:18.819
Surprised the fridge was empty.

05:18.902 --> 05:23.198
And not to mention the family photos.
Your kids are beautiful, by the way.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.203
When did you know?

05:28.287 --> 05:31.582
Partners don't usually flinch
at a $300 bottle of wine.

05:33.292 --> 05:37.296
It's my boss's place.
I'm house-sitting for the weekend.

05:38.422 --> 05:40.090
Fuck. You must think I'm an asshole.

05:40.841 --> 05:45.846
- Are you?
- No, I'm not. I just…

05:47.472 --> 05:48.849
took a risk.

05:50.142 --> 05:52.477
I was trying to impress you.
It was a dumb idea.

05:52.561 --> 05:55.147
I can walk you out.
Order you a Lyft, if you want.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.357
Do you even work in venture capital?

05:57.858 --> 05:59.443
Junior associate.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.990
The "junior" has a nice ring to it,
don't you think?

06:05.073 --> 06:09.661
And the client whose money you tripled?
He really exist?

06:09.745 --> 06:12.581
Dress for the job you want,
not the job you have, right?

06:14.291 --> 06:16.752
You don't have to try to impress me,
you know.

06:17.711 --> 06:21.882
I mean, this stuff is nice, but…
in my experience,

06:22.674 --> 06:25.594
the kind of people who have it
never really appreciate it.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.600
Might as well enjoy it while we're here.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.049
I guess we should go soon.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.468
Why?

07:49.428 --> 07:51.471
Aren't you worried about your boss?

07:51.555 --> 07:54.683
Not really. I was thinking
about quitting anyway, so…

07:56.685 --> 07:57.895
last hurrah.

07:58.979 --> 08:02.107
I'm a last hurrah, am I? That's a first.

08:02.191 --> 08:03.192
No, it's not you.

08:07.988 --> 08:11.992
The guy who owns this place,
he went to Harvard.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.620
And his dad went to Harvard.

08:14.703 --> 08:18.790
And I'm the only guy at the firm
who didn't go to an Ivy League.

08:18.874 --> 08:23.629
So, no matter what I do,
there's this perception.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.967
I'm not one of them. I never will be.

08:34.806 --> 08:35.807
Hey.

08:37.267 --> 08:38.644
Game's not over yet.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.729
Yeah, well, the game's rigged.

08:48.987 --> 08:50.155
You from around here?

08:52.574 --> 08:53.575
London.

08:54.409 --> 08:59.331
I worked in Spain for a bit,
and then a restaurant in Italy.

08:59.998 --> 09:01.250
What about you?

09:01.333 --> 09:05.170
Glamorous Apple Valley, Minnesota.
You know it?

09:08.090 --> 09:09.341
What was London like?

09:10.717 --> 09:13.136
It's a beautiful city.

09:14.471 --> 09:15.931
Culture, the history…

09:16.014 --> 09:17.724
I wasn't talking about the city.

09:18.934 --> 09:21.019
You tell everyone the same thing,
don't you?

09:22.604 --> 09:23.689
Don't lie to me now.

09:23.772 --> 09:28.443
The truth is… so much more interesting.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.113
Okay.

09:34.157 --> 09:38.704
My mom passed when I was young.
It was just the two of us.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.292
We didn't have much. I never knew my dad.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.506
I'm sorry.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.258
Don't be.

09:52.885 --> 09:55.137
This place seemed like a fresh start.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.807
Like I could be anyone I wanted.

09:59.808 --> 10:04.021
I mean, that's the myth of California,
isn't it? You are who you say you are.

10:05.439 --> 10:09.109
And if it doesn't work out here,
then on to somewhere new.

10:13.322 --> 10:14.823
So, who do you say you are?

10:16.825 --> 10:18.160
I haven't decided yet.

10:22.164 --> 10:24.958
You know, I got this weird feeling that…

10:27.211 --> 10:29.087
you could be anyone you wanted.

11:06.583 --> 11:08.502
You know what the best part was?

11:11.421 --> 11:13.507
That you saw right through me.

11:15.634 --> 11:18.887
It was like
I'd finally found my partner in crime.

11:21.557 --> 11:23.350
We didn't poke our heads up for months.

11:23.433 --> 11:27.312
Just… stuck in our own little bubble.

11:28.981 --> 11:31.400
And then I introduced you to my friends.

11:32.109 --> 11:34.903
- You missed the last show.
- I know.

11:34.987 --> 11:36.613
There were people there you should meet.

11:36.697 --> 11:38.866
I'm sorry. I've been busy.

11:38.949 --> 11:40.868
I thought you were gonna quit that job.

11:40.951 --> 11:44.371
Yeah, well, someone talked me out of it.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.456
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:47.416 --> 11:49.459
And I thought
you couldn't be talked out of anything.

11:52.880 --> 11:53.881
Hey.

11:54.965 --> 11:55.966
Hi.

11:57.342 --> 11:59.344
Hi. You must be Sophie.

11:59.428 --> 12:03.515
Hi. So good to meet you.
James has told me all about you.

12:04.016 --> 12:07.102
Has he?
Well, I don't know anything about you.

12:07.186 --> 12:08.937
So tell me everything.

12:09.021 --> 12:11.773
Well, I'm from London.

12:12.399 --> 12:16.320
I always had a fantasy about growing up
in Europe. It seemed so glamorous.

12:16.987 --> 12:17.988
To be honest…

12:20.282 --> 12:21.325
it was pretty idyllic.

12:23.035 --> 12:26.788
We were steps from the park,
best museums in the world.

12:27.289 --> 12:29.708
- What more could you ask for, really?
- Wow.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.628
Okay, so, what are you drinking?

12:33.921 --> 12:36.840
- Anything is fine.
- Stop. Something strong, right?

12:36.924 --> 12:40.010
I know meeting the friends,
it's the worst.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.054
But let's just act like he's not here.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.640
We'll cut through the small talk,
and we'll get to know each other.

12:44.723 --> 12:45.557
What do you say?

12:47.267 --> 12:48.810
Whiskey. Double. Neat.

12:49.603 --> 12:51.897
Attagirl. Okay, be right back.

12:54.399 --> 12:55.400
How am I doing?

12:56.485 --> 12:57.694
Great.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.533
What's that for?

13:02.616 --> 13:03.700
You being you.

13:06.578 --> 13:10.249
And thank you for not telling me
that you two dated beforehand.

13:10.874 --> 13:12.334
I might have been too nervous.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.505
How did you…

13:16.588 --> 13:18.215
The way she looks at you.

13:20.592 --> 13:25.472
Like, it was nothing serious.
It was a long time ago.

13:26.598 --> 13:28.183
We're just friends now.

13:28.767 --> 13:29.810
I kind of love her.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.020
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:37.651 --> 13:40.237
Holy shit. What do we have here?

13:40.821 --> 13:42.447
Sophie, this is Harrison.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.241
I heard a lot about you.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.869
Likewise.
Now, you take good care of my boy here.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.203
He's one of the best, huh?

13:48.287 --> 13:52.249
Despite what the fucking lizards
with all the corner offices think.

13:53.333 --> 13:54.585
You're from London, right?

13:54.668 --> 13:57.087
I have a lot of good friends
in Knightsbridge.

13:57.171 --> 13:58.964
Who's that? He seems popular.

13:59.882 --> 14:04.052
That's Vince Hawkins.
I don't know why he comes to these things.

14:04.136 --> 14:05.470
No one's ever gotten him to bite.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.015
Looks like it's your turn.

14:08.765 --> 14:12.019
- No.
- Why not? What have you got to lose?

14:12.936 --> 14:13.979
My dignity?

14:15.022 --> 14:16.440
Maybe I'll give it a shot.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.610
- Ballsy, wow.
- Wait, so…

14:27.284 --> 14:28.535
Breeders' Cup, right?

14:29.953 --> 14:31.955
Always wished I could have seen it
in person.

14:32.039 --> 14:36.293
Those fairy-tale moments,
like Personal Ensign in '88.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.587
That race must have been
before you were born.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.131
You know horses?

14:42.132 --> 14:44.218
Worked at a stables when I was younger.

14:44.301 --> 14:45.302
Whereabouts?

14:45.802 --> 14:48.180
Private estate. Rich family in the UK.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.642
You work in this terrible business?

14:53.101 --> 14:55.854
My boyfriend does. Have you met him yet?

15:03.654 --> 15:04.821
Hey.

15:04.905 --> 15:07.032
- What's your name, young man?
- James Ellis, sir.

15:07.115 --> 15:09.826
- Tell me how you did it.
- Did what?

15:09.910 --> 15:13.455
Convinced a girl like this
to come to one of these boring parties?

15:14.790 --> 15:18.335
He's very convincing.
One of the best at the firm actually.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.212
Well, that's very kind of you, but--

15:20.295 --> 15:22.589
Anyone can be content
with the money trickling in now,

15:22.673 --> 15:25.092
but it's taking the risks,
predicting the patterns.

15:25.175 --> 15:27.094
That's what makes the real money.

15:27.177 --> 15:29.596
And James can always see
what's coming next.

15:30.514 --> 15:32.975
I've always found that so astounding.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.103
Which is why he has the highest-earning
fund in the whole firm.

15:36.186 --> 15:37.187
Right, James?

15:37.688 --> 15:38.939
Well, congratulations, son.

15:40.941 --> 15:41.942
Thank you.

15:43.068 --> 15:45.362
Anyway, I don't wanna take up
too much more of your time.

15:45.445 --> 15:46.822
- No.
- Should we get a drink?

15:46.905 --> 15:49.700
- Yeah.
- Wait. Let me buy you one.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.536
<i>Hey, what were you doing in there?</i>

15:53.412 --> 15:58.125
People make certain assumptions
about me. So I let them.

15:59.168 --> 16:01.295
If I pretend to be who they want me to be,

16:01.378 --> 16:03.589
even just for a little while,
what's the harm in that?

16:03.672 --> 16:07.509
Yeah, but, I mean,
I don't have the highest-earning fund.

16:07.593 --> 16:10.137
I mean, I'm still years away
from even getting my own fund.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.681
So I bent the truth about a technicality.

16:14.183 --> 16:16.059
It's the same thing you were doing
the night I met you.

16:17.603 --> 16:20.147
Hold on. That was a little different.

16:21.148 --> 16:25.110
Look, some people are born into this life,
right?

16:26.570 --> 16:28.906
Family money, luck of the draw.

16:30.365 --> 16:32.075
Your friends, your coworkers.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.162
None of them worked
as hard as you did to get here.

16:35.245 --> 16:37.581
- They didn't need to, did they?
- No.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.875
Do they deserve it any more than you?
Or me?

16:39.958 --> 16:43.754
I know. But, Sophie, if anyone finds out
I lied to Vince Hawkins

16:43.837 --> 16:46.340
about having my own fund,
I mean, I could lose my job.

16:46.423 --> 16:49.801
Or what would happen
if you went into that office tomorrow

16:49.885 --> 16:54.431
and told them James Ellis
just got Vince Hawkins to invest?

16:55.015 --> 16:57.851
So when he calls about
transferring the money,

16:57.935 --> 16:59.978
James Ellis should probably have
his own fund,

17:00.771 --> 17:02.981
or else the firm's gonna lose that money.

17:04.441 --> 17:08.194
The game's rigged, remember?

17:11.156 --> 17:12.907
So let's even the playing field.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.704
You better hope
that you two never break up,

17:18.789 --> 17:23.252
because if you did, and I was forced
to choose between the two of you…

17:23.335 --> 17:24.545
I don't blame you.

17:26.880 --> 17:29.174
Remind me again why I throw these things.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.844
'Cause you hate being alone.

17:31.927 --> 17:34.513
We're gonna have to work
on that honesty thing of yours.

17:35.472 --> 17:38.851
It wasn't until he won over my father
that I really got it.

17:38.934 --> 17:41.603
Before then,
I was always saying to poor James,

17:41.687 --> 17:43.856
"What exactly is it they pay you for?"

17:44.857 --> 17:46.233
Very sweetly, he insists,

17:46.316 --> 17:48.151
although I'm sure
it was starting to annoy him.

17:49.278 --> 17:51.488
The man--
He's a-- an old-school London banker.

17:51.572 --> 17:53.615
So, he was skeptical at first.

17:54.199 --> 17:55.617
Well, what made him come around?

17:56.285 --> 17:59.830
James took that seed money
and tripled it in six months.

17:59.913 --> 18:00.914
Wow.

18:00.998 --> 18:03.750
Now every time I call home,
he demands I put him on with James,

18:03.834 --> 18:05.544
so the two of them can talk investing.

18:06.211 --> 18:07.921
Sounds like a smart man.

18:08.422 --> 18:10.340
Don't let me leave
without getting your info.

18:10.424 --> 18:11.425
Of course.

18:16.013 --> 18:20.309
I know I've seen it a hundred times,
but that thing you did out there,

18:20.392 --> 18:22.519
it's still the hottest thing you do.

18:25.689 --> 18:28.775
Well, congrats
on the big promotion, buddy.

18:29.693 --> 18:33.614
I mean, the view's not quite as good
as mine, but I guess it'll do.

18:34.114 --> 18:36.116
Let me take you out tonight.
We'll celebrate.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.827
I'll even suffer through a strip club
for you, partner.

18:38.911 --> 18:42.789
I wish I could. I've got a--
I've got plans with Sophie.

18:42.873 --> 18:45.125
Right, right. Of course.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.630
You're in it pretty deep with her, huh?

18:50.797 --> 18:53.675
I mean, yeah. Why?

18:55.177 --> 18:56.178
No, I just--

18:57.930 --> 18:59.348
I'm sorry. It's just that…

19:02.851 --> 19:04.853
Something's off, right?

19:04.937 --> 19:07.564
Like there's part of the story
we don't know.

19:08.774 --> 19:10.901
What part?

19:13.654 --> 19:16.406
I don't know, all of it.

19:16.907 --> 19:18.325
You know, her past.

19:18.408 --> 19:21.078
I mean, she's not exactly been
an open book, right?

19:21.161 --> 19:24.665
And you gotta remember, we're dealing
with a lot of people's money here.

19:26.875 --> 19:31.171
Have you ever thought
of having someone look into her?

19:31.839 --> 19:33.298
Just as a precaution?

19:38.428 --> 19:39.555
You know, this is the--

19:40.055 --> 19:43.600
This is the woman that I'm gonna spend
the rest of my life with.

19:43.684 --> 19:46.395
So don't ever fucking talk about her
like that again, okay?

19:47.604 --> 19:49.898
Jesus Christ, man.
I'm just looking out for you, buddy.

19:50.566 --> 19:52.526
But, I mean, whatever.
You wanna get fucked?

19:52.609 --> 19:56.822
You go right ahead.
You get fucked, all right. Not my problem.

20:17.926 --> 20:18.927
James?

20:29.062 --> 20:30.063
It's ours.

20:34.193 --> 20:35.694
Come on. Come upstairs.

20:37.446 --> 20:38.447
Come on.

20:41.116 --> 20:42.159
In there.

20:44.036 --> 20:45.579
Over there. By the window.

21:03.555 --> 21:09.061
You always said that she loved the beach.
The happy times were there.

21:10.103 --> 21:13.273
So, I thought that I would try
to give you that view,

21:13.357 --> 21:15.359
so you can wake up to it every day.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.454
Are you sure you want to do this?

21:28.914 --> 21:30.165
Of course I'm sure.

21:33.836 --> 21:34.837
Are you?

21:39.383 --> 21:40.551
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

21:40.634 --> 21:41.635
Yeah.

21:47.391 --> 21:50.477
Welcome to your new home!

21:52.229 --> 21:53.230
Down the hall.

21:54.273 --> 21:56.316
Hey. Sorry. Hey.

21:56.400 --> 21:57.734
- Hey.
- Have you seen Sophie?

21:58.235 --> 22:01.697
Not for a while. No.
I hope she didn't get lost in her closet.

22:01.780 --> 22:03.866
Gives Siberia a run for its money.

22:04.700 --> 22:09.204
And I remember when dropping
20 bucks at dinner made you sweat.

22:09.705 --> 22:12.499
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

22:18.714 --> 22:21.425
I can't believe how nice
this place turned out.

22:21.508 --> 22:24.178
I mean, you have so much room.
You'll never outgrow it.

22:24.261 --> 22:26.555
Well, I can't take any of the credit.

22:26.638 --> 22:30.142
It much be such a relief to know
you bought the house you're gonna die in.

22:31.310 --> 22:33.520
I'm just gonna
check on something upstairs.

22:34.438 --> 22:36.315
- Grab a drink.
- Yeah, of course.

22:36.398 --> 22:39.568
- Hey, James.
- Hey, how are ya?

22:43.947 --> 22:46.158
What are you doing hiding up here?

22:48.869 --> 22:50.287
Just catching my breath.

22:51.163 --> 22:52.623
Nice place, by the way.

22:53.874 --> 22:54.958
Did you need something?

22:55.042 --> 22:56.668
Just looking for the bathroom.

22:56.752 --> 22:58.378
- Behind you.
- Right.

22:59.463 --> 23:03.091
I have this little tradition
at housewarming parties.

23:03.634 --> 23:06.720
I like to take a shit
on the nicest toilet in the place.

23:07.846 --> 23:09.097
Charming.

23:09.181 --> 23:10.891
Not really. No.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.894
But at least I'm honest.

23:15.938 --> 23:18.106
At least when people
crawl into bed with me,

23:18.190 --> 23:20.817
they can't say they weren't warned.

23:22.611 --> 23:26.281
Maybe it wouldn't piss me off so much,
if you were doing it to someone like--

23:27.115 --> 23:29.326
Well, like me.

23:31.495 --> 23:32.496
Doing what?

23:33.372 --> 23:34.915
Well, that's the million-dollar question,

23:34.998 --> 23:36.375
isn't it, Sophie?

23:38.377 --> 23:42.089
I mean, fuck, there are thousands
of VC douches in this town

23:42.172 --> 23:45.425
that would more than deserve
someone like you.

23:47.010 --> 23:49.513
My boy James isn't one of 'em.

23:52.099 --> 23:53.642
You think I don't know that?

23:56.812 --> 23:59.356
You think I don't know
that he's better than me?

24:00.315 --> 24:04.152
More caring? Trusting? Loyal?

24:06.697 --> 24:08.448
Well, then what the fuck
are you doing with him?

24:09.533 --> 24:10.659
Trying to deserve him.

24:13.412 --> 24:14.413
I really am.

24:20.043 --> 24:21.128
Was he right?

24:23.547 --> 24:24.548
About me?

24:26.800 --> 24:28.010
Tell me the truth.

24:29.052 --> 24:33.515
How did we go from all that to this?

24:34.141 --> 24:35.475
It's complicated.

24:36.476 --> 24:39.313
Looking back on it, yeah, maybe you were--

24:39.396 --> 24:40.439
you were depressed.

24:42.024 --> 24:43.233
I should have dug deeper.

24:44.860 --> 24:50.407
I think a part of me was jealous of you.

24:51.241 --> 24:52.743
How easy it all came.

24:53.869 --> 24:57.456
Sometimes I wondered if I could
have ever done any of it without you.

24:58.957 --> 25:00.667
<i>I wanted to be in the spotlight.</i>

25:02.169 --> 25:04.171
- Hey. How are you?
-<i>But you…</i>

25:06.256 --> 25:08.383
<i>you shined so bright.</i>

25:09.885 --> 25:11.803
So I made you stand behind me.

25:15.265 --> 25:16.517
What do you mean?

25:16.600 --> 25:19.978
We started living our own lives,
arguing more and more.

25:21.104 --> 25:26.235
Not telling each other everything.
We didn't feel like partners anymore.

25:28.862 --> 25:30.864
Once that trust is broken,

25:31.657 --> 25:34.535
I guess it wasn't that hard
to just drift away.

25:35.994 --> 25:40.374
Did I… drift away?

25:44.127 --> 25:45.504
It's almost time for the big toast.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.297
- You know what you're gonna say?
- Yeah.

25:47.381 --> 25:48.382
It's in my pocket.

25:48.465 --> 25:49.675
- Okay, good. Great.
- Yeah.

25:50.384 --> 25:51.468
Don't fuck it up.

25:52.511 --> 25:54.638
But it wasn't until he won over my father

25:54.721 --> 25:59.142
that I understood what makes him
so special. So good at what he does.

25:59.226 --> 26:02.271
My father is very skeptical of
the VC thing.

26:02.354 --> 26:07.317
He's a London banker,
very traditional, dour.

26:08.652 --> 26:12.573
Honestly, I've seen bank vaults part
with their money more easily.

26:13.448 --> 26:17.911
But when James took a small bit of
seed money from my father,

26:17.995 --> 26:20.539
and tripled it in six months?

26:20.622 --> 26:22.749
Now you should see
how my father looks at him.

26:22.833 --> 26:24.793
Excuse me.
Can I borrow my wife for a second?

26:24.877 --> 26:26.211
- Of course.
- Thank you.

26:28.964 --> 26:30.632
What are you doing?

26:30.716 --> 26:33.343
What is with you lately? I had the guy--

26:33.427 --> 26:38.015
Stop. Look around. Look, we won.

26:38.098 --> 26:39.474
You don't have to do that anymore.

26:40.058 --> 26:41.268
No, you won.

26:41.852 --> 26:44.605
Why can't you just relax
and enjoy it for a second?

26:44.688 --> 26:48.734
Just quit trying so hard.
Grab a drink. Just have fun.

26:48.817 --> 26:52.529
- Have fun?
- Yeah, have fun. Go find some appetizers.

26:52.613 --> 26:55.032
Talk to the wives. Just don't bother
the clients anymore.

26:55.115 --> 26:57.284
You look desperate,
and how's that supposed to make me look?

27:00.579 --> 27:02.706
- What?
- Hey. You're on, bro.

27:06.585 --> 27:08.670
- What the fuck?
- Yeah.

27:15.177 --> 27:16.428
Yeah. Let's go.

27:18.472 --> 27:19.473
Good call.

27:24.603 --> 27:27.022
Best to just let that fire
burn itself out.

27:27.105 --> 27:28.106
Yeah.

27:28.190 --> 27:29.650
Hey. Here he is.

27:30.567 --> 27:34.321
Guy who likes to be fashionably late
at his own party, James Ellis.

27:34.404 --> 27:35.614
Man of the hour.

27:36.365 --> 27:38.867
Thank you.

27:40.244 --> 27:42.246
I'm sorry to keep you all waiting.

27:49.586 --> 27:53.006
Thank you for coming tonight
and celebrating everything

27:53.090 --> 27:56.426
that we've accomplished together.

27:58.554 --> 28:01.390
And I couldn't have done it
without you guys, so--

28:01.473 --> 28:02.474
- Ten billion, guys.
- Yeah.

28:02.558 --> 28:03.684
Ten billion.

28:21.493 --> 28:22.786
Soph?

28:27.040 --> 28:28.667
Soph, come down!

28:36.425 --> 28:38.177
Come on. I'm sorry.

28:52.649 --> 28:53.692
Soph?

29:01.575 --> 29:02.659
It's late.

29:06.538 --> 29:07.956
Still at it, huh?

29:10.042 --> 29:12.836
Yeah. We're supposed to be celebrating.

29:15.172 --> 29:16.298
Where were you?

29:17.966 --> 29:22.179
Just went for a walk down by the water.

29:24.765 --> 29:25.766
Hey, look<i>…</i>

29:27.643 --> 29:31.563
I didn't mean what I said
before at the party, okay?

29:31.647 --> 29:36.151
I just wanted my wife.

29:40.072 --> 29:43.492
I find those things a bit suffocating.

29:44.785 --> 29:45.786
That's all.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.044
Gonna get some sleep.

30:03.720 --> 30:08.225
I don't know what it was
that shifted that night, but I--

30:09.935 --> 30:11.061
I could feel it.

30:18.569 --> 30:25.325
Then months went by,
and… we just grew apart.

30:31.498 --> 30:32.583
You going to Marin?

30:32.666 --> 30:34.877
Oh, yeah. Didn't I mention?

30:35.419 --> 30:36.461
No, you didn't.

30:37.504 --> 30:39.381
I just need some fresh air.

30:39.464 --> 30:41.258
You know how the city
gets to me sometimes.

30:43.594 --> 30:44.803
It's only for one night.

31:29.890 --> 31:30.933
<i>Hey, slow down.</i>

31:31.016 --> 31:33.352
<i>Come on. It's fun.</i>

31:33.435 --> 31:35.687
<i>All right. I'm coming. Relax.</i>

31:35.771 --> 31:36.939
<i>Close the door.</i>

31:58.544 --> 32:01.255
Hi. Are you okay?

32:01.338 --> 32:02.464
Can I come in?

32:02.548 --> 32:03.549
What's wrong?

32:22.693 --> 32:24.486
You know, you can tell me anything.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.368
I'm losing her.

32:34.454 --> 32:36.957
- Shit, James.
- Yeah.

32:40.377 --> 32:41.795
You know, it's not just you.

32:43.255 --> 32:45.048
I haven't heard from her in weeks.

32:45.716 --> 32:50.762
You know, maybe she's just
going through something right now

32:50.846 --> 32:55.392
and she just needs space from everyone.

32:57.144 --> 32:59.396
Maybe it's not about me? Come on.

33:00.606 --> 33:02.900
All marriages have ups and downs.

33:02.983 --> 33:06.737
You know? You're gonna spend
your life with someone.

33:06.820 --> 33:08.405
It's gonna ebb and flow.

33:10.782 --> 33:13.702
At least that's what they say.
I wouldn't know.

33:15.787 --> 33:18.749
Okay. There he is.

33:20.292 --> 33:22.002
There is the James I know.

33:26.757 --> 33:31.220
I just-- I thought I gave her
the life she always wanted.

33:31.303 --> 33:33.639
So, why is it suddenly not enough?

33:39.561 --> 33:42.898
Okay, I'm the first person
to say you're not perfect.

33:44.107 --> 33:46.485
I've known you long enough
to know that.

33:49.112 --> 33:50.531
But no one is.

33:52.658 --> 33:55.285
That's the thing. People fuck up.

33:56.995 --> 33:59.665
And we say shitty, terrible things
to each other.

34:01.750 --> 34:04.086
But it doesn't erase everything else.

34:06.839 --> 34:10.467
You love her with your whole heart.

34:11.927 --> 34:14.721
It's all any of us can ask for.

35:00.642 --> 35:02.561
Don't you wanna know
where I've been all night?

35:07.107 --> 35:08.108
What I've done?

35:10.694 --> 35:13.030
Or do you not fucking care anymore?

35:13.739 --> 35:15.699
I mean,
at least have the balls to admit it.

35:15.782 --> 35:18.702
Stop pretending we're in a goddamn,
fucking relationship here.

35:22.706 --> 35:24.208
I know you're having an affair.

35:26.376 --> 35:29.379
Everyone does. Even Caroline noticed
you haven't talked to her in weeks.

35:29.463 --> 35:32.674
So, who are you talking to, Sophie?

35:35.761 --> 35:36.929
What else did Caroline say?

35:37.930 --> 35:39.139
It's not about that.

35:44.353 --> 35:47.397
Is that where you were? Last night?

35:51.610 --> 35:52.694
Look, it--

35:54.988 --> 35:57.533
It just happened, okay? I didn't--

35:59.576 --> 36:01.328
It didn't mean anything, or--

36:02.579 --> 36:04.706
Of course, you were with her.

36:06.083 --> 36:08.752
Okay. I fucked up.

36:08.836 --> 36:11.880
I fucked up, okay? But I'm not sorry.

36:13.841 --> 36:16.385
Because that's what I had to do
to get your attention.

36:16.468 --> 36:19.179
You're so far deep into whatever it is.
I can't--

36:19.680 --> 36:21.431
I can't even reach you anymore.

36:21.515 --> 36:23.475
The person I know best,
sometimes the only person

36:23.559 --> 36:26.270
in the whole fucking world
I feel like I know at all. She's gone.

36:26.770 --> 36:29.147
- She's been gone for months.
- Why do you care anyway?

36:29.773 --> 36:31.733
You don't need me anymore.
That was made perfectly clear.

36:31.817 --> 36:33.360
Look, I know what you're doing here.

36:33.443 --> 36:35.362
You're scared, and you're pushing me away

36:35.445 --> 36:37.114
because you feel like
if you can hurt me enough,

36:37.197 --> 36:38.824
then I'll let you go,
and then you can walk away

36:38.907 --> 36:41.368
without feeling bad about it
because there'll be nothing left behind.

36:45.205 --> 36:46.957
You don't get to decide how this ends.

36:48.208 --> 36:50.335
Don't you get it by now, Sophie?

36:52.045 --> 36:53.630
I'm not walking away from you.

36:54.715 --> 36:57.551
You can try to hurt me
as much as you want,

36:57.634 --> 36:59.678
and I'm not gonna walk away from you.

37:01.972 --> 37:06.226
I love you. No matter what.

37:15.110 --> 37:18.405
So… what happened?

37:20.157 --> 37:22.451
You told me you ended it.

37:35.297 --> 37:39.676
And we decided that
we wouldn't see Caroline as much anymore.

37:41.428 --> 37:42.888
And then we…

37:45.641 --> 37:46.683
started over.

37:51.480 --> 37:52.648
At least I thought we did.

37:56.652 --> 37:58.362
Aren't you going to the hospital today?

37:59.238 --> 38:00.614
Shift's not till Wednesday.

38:01.448 --> 38:02.616
I've got a lunch thing though.

38:03.158 --> 38:06.745
Alexandra's started this new foundation.
Down at the Ritz.

38:07.412 --> 38:08.413
Should be fun.

38:09.957 --> 38:11.208
How's work?

38:11.291 --> 38:15.254
It's slammed.
I guess the new merger turned some heads.

38:16.672 --> 38:20.759
That reminds me.
There's this tech guy, Greg.

38:21.593 --> 38:23.303
His wife's on the board at the hospital.

38:23.929 --> 38:25.764
I ran into them the other day at Leo's.

38:27.224 --> 38:29.518
I guess he's into some new venture.

38:30.519 --> 38:32.062
Kept wanting me to bring it up to you.

38:32.145 --> 38:34.523
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Third time he's mentioned it.

38:35.607 --> 38:38.735
Anyway, I'm staying out of it.
Like you asked.

38:44.658 --> 38:45.951
What's the venture?

38:46.785 --> 38:48.745
It's all very hush-hush.

38:48.829 --> 38:51.999
What did he call it?
A "stealth mode start-up."

38:53.041 --> 38:56.920
- Really?
- Yeah, some secretive software project.

38:57.754 --> 38:58.881
Patent's still pending.

38:59.506 --> 39:02.009
- Did he give you a deck?
- Yeah, maybe.

39:02.092 --> 39:03.677
- Yeah?
- Somewhere.

39:08.307 --> 39:11.351
They don't want competitors to know
they're launching a new product.

39:11.435 --> 39:12.728
Don't want word to get out.

39:13.729 --> 39:16.607
Anyway, the whole thing
sounds kinda shady, doesn't it?

39:16.690 --> 39:19.902
No, I mean, not really.
This happens all the time.

39:19.985 --> 39:21.320
Does it look legit?

39:22.613 --> 39:24.281
Yeah-- How did you say this would work?

39:25.490 --> 39:28.702
They just need the firm's investment
to go through a third party.

39:29.411 --> 39:32.331
Someone they trust,
who's not officially affiliated.

39:32.915 --> 39:35.042
I mean, this could be a huge opportunity.

39:36.710 --> 39:37.711
Seriously?

39:37.794 --> 39:40.923
Yeah, I mean, it's hard to get in
on the ground floor of these things.

39:41.006 --> 39:43.091
They only accept, like,
a handful of investors.

39:43.175 --> 39:45.135
This is something
you're seriously considering?

39:45.219 --> 39:47.471
What was the minimum? Did he say?

39:49.056 --> 39:50.599
Had to be over ten million.

39:51.558 --> 39:52.559
Great.

39:53.602 --> 39:56.313
Look, it's the firm's money.
We'll get it back to them eventually.

39:56.396 --> 39:57.397
Doubled.

39:58.607 --> 40:00.484
Who would be the third party?

40:01.276 --> 40:02.277
You.

40:25.968 --> 40:29.304
Greg. Hi. Look, I--

40:29.388 --> 40:32.140
I know we're not supposed to talk in--
in public. James Ellis.

40:33.016 --> 40:34.017
I remember.

40:34.643 --> 40:37.229
Look, I think the company's
gonna be huge, man.

40:37.312 --> 40:41.275
- So thanks for giving us the opportunity.
- What is this? Some kinda joke?

40:41.942 --> 40:43.610
Your deal never closed.

40:44.319 --> 40:46.572
- What?
- Your investment never came through.

40:46.655 --> 40:48.866
Left us hanging at the last minute.

40:52.786 --> 40:55.163
Mr. Billimack? They're ready for you now.

40:57.207 --> 41:01.003
So, fuck you, man.

41:09.803 --> 41:11.013
<i>James Ellis's office.</i>

41:11.096 --> 41:13.724
Did the Hyperion Financial
transfer ever go through?

41:13.807 --> 41:14.808
<i>James?</i>

41:14.892 --> 41:18.145
$11.25 million came out of the firm
into a third-party account

41:18.228 --> 41:20.647
for the stealth start-up.
Did the transfer ever go through?

41:21.315 --> 41:22.399
Let me verify.

41:26.778 --> 41:31.283
Yeah, three weeks ago.
It all went out, your authorization.

41:33.994 --> 41:34.995
Fuck!

41:40.959 --> 41:42.002
It's nothing fancy.

41:43.712 --> 41:44.713
Looks great.

41:47.341 --> 41:51.803
By the way, what's the timeline
on the patent approval?

41:51.887 --> 41:53.430
Did you speak to Greg at all?

41:54.431 --> 41:55.599
I spoke to him today.

41:56.683 --> 41:59.394
We should have a schedule
by the time you get back from Portland.

42:01.271 --> 42:02.314
Portland?

42:04.441 --> 42:06.735
The conference? You're going, right?

42:06.818 --> 42:09.863
Oh, no. I was gonna skip that.

42:09.947 --> 42:10.948
Really?

42:11.448 --> 42:15.494
It's such a great networking event.
You should go.

42:18.997 --> 42:22.376
You're right.
I'll have Victoria book a flight.

42:24.670 --> 42:26.296
Sorry. Did you want a glass?

42:26.380 --> 42:27.381
Sure.

42:36.974 --> 42:37.975
Spoons.

42:42.938 --> 42:45.023
<i>I immediately knew
that something was up.</i>

42:46.316 --> 42:48.110
So I pretended to go.

42:49.653 --> 42:53.407
And I drove around the block,
and I saw you get into a car,

42:53.991 --> 42:55.409
and I followed you.

43:01.957 --> 43:06.503
<i>I followed you to the bank.
Where you had hid the money.</i>

43:27.524 --> 43:29.860
<i>And then I followed you to the pier.</i>

43:32.154 --> 43:34.531
<i>I mean,
I didn't know where you were going,</i>

43:34.615 --> 43:37.034
<i>but there was no doubt
that you were going.</i>

43:45.292 --> 43:46.335
Where are you going?

43:49.296 --> 43:51.673
You hopped in a car.
You drained the account.

43:52.216 --> 43:53.592
What's on the end of this route?

43:54.760 --> 43:55.969
Let me guess. Private airport?

43:58.972 --> 44:02.267
What'd you do? Did you shell out
the money to a couple offshore accounts,

44:02.351 --> 44:04.061
make sure it's not traceable?

44:04.144 --> 44:06.480
That's smart. You always have been.

44:06.563 --> 44:09.900
Why does it even matter?
It's no one person's money, right?

44:10.526 --> 44:13.111
Isn't it just breakage?
Hide it in the books.

44:13.195 --> 44:14.363
No one will even miss it.

44:15.489 --> 44:16.657
When did it start?

44:17.533 --> 44:21.745
Was it Greg's fucking stealth start-up?
Or was this your plan all along?

44:21.828 --> 44:24.331
Were you looking for me
in the restaurant that night?

44:28.877 --> 44:30.671
What the fuck?

44:31.255 --> 44:34.967
You left me behind a long time ago.

44:35.050 --> 44:37.511
So don't act all surprised
that I did the same to you.

44:37.594 --> 44:39.888
We were trying to fix it.
We were trying to get back on track.

44:39.972 --> 44:42.057
You can't just put the pieces
back together, James.

44:42.140 --> 44:43.225
That's not how it works.

44:43.308 --> 44:45.561
You can't fix something
that's already broken.

44:53.318 --> 44:54.903
What about the guy you were seeing?

44:55.821 --> 44:58.907
Was he in on this too?
Or did you never stop seeing him?

45:00.450 --> 45:04.580
- It's not about either of you.
- Then tell me what it fucking is, Sophie!

45:04.663 --> 45:07.124
Was our whole marriage-- Was it all--
The whole thing, was it a lie?

45:07.207 --> 45:08.834
- I was trying.
- You were trying.

45:08.917 --> 45:09.918
Because I loved you.

45:10.002 --> 45:14.631
Great. Well, at least now
we know the truth, don't we?

45:16.425 --> 45:18.343
You're not even capable of love.

45:21.847 --> 45:23.765
- Do you really believe that?
- This is what you do.

45:23.849 --> 45:26.185
You told me,
and I should've fucking listened.

45:26.768 --> 45:28.854
You use people up,
you take everything you can,

45:28.937 --> 45:30.564
and then you start over somewhere new.

45:30.647 --> 45:34.693
But it's not really starting over,
is it, Sophie? It's just running.

45:34.776 --> 45:38.864
But it doesn't matter how far you go,
you still have to live with yourself.

45:43.785 --> 45:47.331
Go on. Just do what you're gonna do.

47:04.366 --> 47:06.201
Found the letter you'd written.

47:08.203 --> 47:09.329
<i>You were leaving me.</i>

47:13.917 --> 47:16.587
<i>But what I said to you
pushed you over the edge.</i>

47:23.719 --> 47:24.845
<i>Is she gonna be okay?</i>

47:24.928 --> 47:27.264
-<i>Are you her husband?</i>
-<i>Yeah, I'm her fucking husband!</i>

47:27.764 --> 47:29.558
<i>Your wife's in critical condition.</i>

47:29.641 --> 47:30.976
She-- Is she gonna die?

47:31.685 --> 47:32.769
We don't know yet.

47:34.646 --> 47:37.232
What--

47:38.609 --> 47:39.943
What happened?

47:41.153 --> 47:43.697
Your wife jumped from the edge of a ferry.

47:44.281 --> 47:45.949
She's very lucky.
One centimeter to the right--

47:46.033 --> 47:49.536
No, Sophie. She wouldn't do that.

47:49.620 --> 47:51.788
Sophie wouldn't-- She would not do that.

47:51.872 --> 47:54.625
<i>I know it's hard to accept as a loved one.</i>

47:55.292 --> 47:56.543
<i>It's a natural response.</i>

47:59.213 --> 48:01.048
<i>Can I see her?</i>

48:01.131 --> 48:03.717
<i>Once she's stabilized. I'll come find you.</i>

48:08.514 --> 48:12.142
<i>As you know, your wife has
suffered a traumatic brain injury.</i>

48:12.726 --> 48:15.896
Over the last two weeks,
we've done a battery of tests,

48:16.563 --> 48:18.190
and the conclusion is always the same.

48:18.273 --> 48:21.276
Your wife has lost her long-term memory.

48:22.236 --> 48:23.737
<i>What does that mean?</i>

48:24.738 --> 48:26.615
<i>The essence of her is still the same,</i>

48:26.698 --> 48:33.330
<i>but the events that shaped her,
her traumas, her past, they're all gone.</i>

48:34.623 --> 48:37.125
What are you saying? What--
She's someone else?

48:40.045 --> 48:44.508
Maybe you can look at it as a fresh start.

48:54.768 --> 48:59.773
I thought that I could fix it.

49:02.442 --> 49:05.904
<i>And I could find the money, put it back.</i>

49:07.948 --> 49:11.076
<i>And cover up all the fucked-up things
that happened between us.</i>

49:12.911 --> 49:14.538
<i>So you never had to relive it again.</i>

49:20.294 --> 49:21.295
James Ellis?

49:21.920 --> 49:24.006
- Yeah?
- Officer Linda Johnson.

49:24.506 --> 49:26.425
I've been assigned to your wife's case.

49:26.508 --> 49:30.387
I just wanted to ask you a few questions,
if now is a good time.

49:32.097 --> 49:33.098
Sure. Yeah.

49:39.897 --> 49:41.398
Look, I know this is hard.

49:42.691 --> 49:47.321
But were there any signs that your wife
was thinking of ending her life?

49:53.785 --> 49:58.582
There was one… a letter.

50:04.129 --> 50:05.255
A suicide note.

50:15.140 --> 50:16.183
Are you okay?

50:20.979 --> 50:22.022
I don't know.

50:24.733 --> 50:26.276
How would you be if you woke up

50:26.360 --> 50:28.445
and found you were
a shitty fucking person?

50:30.113 --> 50:31.240
You're not.

50:31.323 --> 50:32.533
How can you say that?

50:33.033 --> 50:37.371
We were just wrong about
what was important.

50:37.454 --> 50:42.501
And maybe we had to lose it all
to realize that.

50:45.879 --> 50:48.048
In a way, you saved us both.

50:49.299 --> 50:53.220
Because we don't have to be
those shitty fucking people anymore.

50:54.763 --> 50:59.768
So, what?
I'm just supposed to let all that go?

51:00.435 --> 51:02.688
Look, whatever you were running from,

51:02.771 --> 51:05.858
whatever stopped you from being happy…

51:08.318 --> 51:11.488
I thought that was gone too.

51:12.155 --> 51:17.411
And in some weird way,
I thought it was a gift.

51:21.373 --> 51:25.878
How can you still love me? After all that.

51:28.672 --> 51:30.966
I still love the girl I met that night.

51:33.302 --> 51:34.469
And I always will.

51:43.478 --> 51:44.938
And maybe…

51:49.318 --> 51:53.697
Maybe all the shitty things
that happened since…

51:57.201 --> 51:58.994
Maybe we could just try to forget.

52:03.290 --> 52:05.000
I don't know if I can fix this.

52:08.629 --> 52:09.838
Then we'll do it together.
