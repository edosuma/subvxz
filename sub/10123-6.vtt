00:00.600 --> 00:02.233
I HAVE GRADED
YOUR BOOK REPORTS

00:02.233 --> 00:03.500
FROM LAST FRIDAY,

00:03.500 --> 00:04.900
AND AFTER
I PASS THEM OUT,

00:04.900 --> 00:07.867
WE'LL DISCUSS THEM.

00:07.867 --> 00:10.867
AH, MR. MATTHEWS.

00:13.400 --> 00:15.667
SHALL I EXPRESS
MY USUAL DISAPPOINTMENT

00:15.667 --> 00:20.300
OR JUST ASK YOU TO GUIDE
MY SLEIGH TONIGHT?

00:20.300 --> 00:22.900
UH, WRONG HOLIDAY,
MR. FEENY.

00:22.900 --> 00:24.667
SEE, HALLOWEEN'S
COMING UP,

00:24.667 --> 00:26.767
AND I WAS JUST
TEST DRIVING MY CLOWN NOSE.

00:26.767 --> 00:28.667
THEN I INSIST

00:28.667 --> 00:29.834
IN THE DRIVER'S
SEAT.

00:29.834 --> 00:31.133
PUT THE NOSE
BACK ON...

00:32.500 --> 00:33.600
FOR THE REST
OF THE MORNING.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.300
MR. MINKUS,
EXCELLENT WORK AS USUAL.

00:38.300 --> 00:40.400
I PARTICULARLY
ENJOYED YOUR HAIKU

00:40.400 --> 00:42.767
ON CAPTAIN AHAB'S
OBSESSION

00:42.767 --> 00:43.800
WITH THE GREAT
WHITE WHALE.

THE MONSTER'S EYE.

00:49.000 --> 00:53.567
HE SEES ME...
WHALE FOOD."

00:53.567 --> 00:56.667
IT WORKS
ON SO MANY LEVELS.

00:56.667 --> 00:58.033

01:00.300 --> 01:02.300
MR. LEWIS,
VERY GOOD WORK.

01:02.300 --> 01:06.033
MR. MATTHEWS, NOT ONE
OF YOUR BETTER EFFORTS.

01:06.033 --> 01:08.200
MR. HUNTER.

01:08.200 --> 01:12.000
HEY, THIS ISN'T FAIR.
RICK AND I BOTH GOT Cs.

01:12.000 --> 01:13.767
HOW COME YOU TELL HIM
HE DID GOOD WORK,

01:13.767 --> 01:16.467
AND YOU TELL ME IT WASN'T
ONE OF MY BETTER EFFORTS?

01:16.467 --> 01:19.367
WOULD BOZO PLEASE
COME TO THE CENTER RING?

01:23.734 --> 01:27.467
MR. LEWIS WORKED VERY HARD
TO GET HIS C,

01:27.467 --> 01:29.500
AND I RESPECT HIM
FOR THAT.

01:29.500 --> 01:32.200
YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND,
WASTE YOUR EFFORTS

01:32.200 --> 01:33.734
ON BEING
THE CLASS CLOWN.

01:35.133 --> 01:37.934
HOW COME YOU ALWAYS
PICK ON ME, MR. FEENY?

01:37.934 --> 01:40.400
HOW COME YOU NEVER
PICK ON MINKUS?

01:40.400 --> 01:43.200
HAVE YOU TAKEN A BLOW
TO THE HEAD, MR. MATTHEWS?

01:43.200 --> 01:45.700
STUART MINKUS
GETS NOTHING BUT As.

01:45.700 --> 01:47.667
IF THERE WAS A LETTER
BEFORE "A,"

01:47.667 --> 01:49.033
HE WOULD GET THAT.

01:49.033 --> 01:51.600
I GUESS THAT'S WHY
HE GETS AWAY WITH SO MUCH.

01:51.600 --> 01:53.700
AND JUST WHAT DOES HE
GET AWAY WITH?

01:53.700 --> 01:56.200
WELL, HOW COME WHEN
I MAKE PAPER AIRPLANES,

01:56.200 --> 01:58.867
I GET DETENTION,
AND HE DOESN'T?

02:06.400 --> 02:09.100
I WITHDRAW
THE QUESTION.

02:12.834 --> 02:15.867
[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

03:19.100 --> 03:20.567
YOU WAITED FOR ME?

03:20.567 --> 03:22.734
AM I NOT
YOUR BEST FRIEND?

03:22.734 --> 03:24.300
YOU HAD DETENTION, TOO,
DIDN'T YOU?

03:24.300 --> 03:26.667
OH, YEAH.
MRS. ENGLES NAILED ME.

03:26.667 --> 03:29.500
HOW'D YOU GET
DETENTION IN ART?

03:29.500 --> 03:33.934
WELL, THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME
ONE OF THE GREATS.

03:33.934 --> 03:35.600
HEY.

03:39.000 --> 03:41.300

03:41.300 --> 03:43.834
WE CAN'T BE LOOKING
AT TEST ANSWERS.

03:43.834 --> 03:45.400
THAT'S
MAJOR CHEATING,

03:45.400 --> 03:48.100
DETENTION FOR LIFE.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.767
NO, THESE AREN'T
FOR A REAL TEST.

03:49.767 --> 03:53.200
THEY'RE FOR THAT STUPID
IQ EXAM WE'RE TAKING TOMORROW.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.133
WAIT A MINUTE.

03:58.133 --> 04:01.367
LET ME TAKE A LOOK
AT THIS.

04:01.367 --> 04:02.367
WOW.

04:02.367 --> 04:04.400
THE PERSON WHO
KNOWS THESE ANSWERS

04:04.400 --> 04:05.800
GETS
A PERFECT SCORE.

04:05.800 --> 04:08.734
ON A TEST THAT DOESN'T
EVEN COUNT FOR A GRADE.

04:08.734 --> 04:09.734
WHY BOTHER?

04:09.734 --> 04:10.867
ARE YOU KIDDING?

04:10.867 --> 04:13.000
THIS IS MY ONE TICKET
TO GET FEENY OFF MY BACK.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.800
IF FEENY THINKS
I'M A GENIUS,

04:14.800 --> 04:17.500
HE'LL TREAT ME JUST AS
GOOD AS HE TREATS MINKUS.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.300
HEY, CORY,
DO YOURSELF A FAVOR.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.500
CRUMPLE THE PAPER UP,
THROW IT AWAY IN THE TRASH.

04:22.500 --> 04:23.900
DON'T COMPLICATE
YOUR LIFE.

04:23.900 --> 04:26.867
YOU KNOW, THAT MAKES
A LOT OF SENSE,

04:26.867 --> 04:28.900
AND IF I WAS
A SMARTER PERSON,

04:28.900 --> 04:31.300
I'D PROBABLY LISTEN
TO YOU,

04:31.300 --> 04:33.400
EXCEPT I'M NOT
A SMARTER PERSON,

04:33.400 --> 04:37.500
BUT TOMORROW, I'M GOING
TO BE A GENIUS.

04:45.200 --> 04:47.500
I HAVE IN MY HANDS
THE RESULTS

04:47.500 --> 04:49.400
OF TUESDAY'S
IQ TEST,

04:49.400 --> 04:53.700
AND ONE PERSON HERE
DESERVES SPECIAL MENTION.

04:53.700 --> 04:55.000
THIS PERSON ACHIEVED

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
NOT ONLY THE HIGHEST
SCORE IN THE CLASS,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.834
NOT ONLY THE HIGHEST
SCORE IN THE SCHOOL,

05:00.834 --> 05:02.834
BUT A SCORE SO HIGH

05:02.834 --> 05:05.033
AS TO GIVE RISE
TO THE QUESTION,

05:05.033 --> 05:06.033
"IS THERE, IN FACT,

05:06.033 --> 05:09.800
A CEILING ON
HUMAN INTELLIGENCE?"

05:09.800 --> 05:13.667
PLEASE, MR. FEENY,
YOU'RE EMBARRASSING ME.

05:13.667 --> 05:16.000
MR. MINKUS,
YOU CAME IN SECOND.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
SECOND?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.233
MM-HM.

05:18.233 --> 05:22.567
AS IN THE CONTEXT
OF NOT FIRST?

05:22.567 --> 05:26.233
SOMEONE SCORED HIGHER
THAN I DID ON THE IQ TEST?

05:26.233 --> 05:28.667
BLEW YOU OUT
OF THE ACADEMIC WATER.

05:30.367 --> 05:33.400
SOMEONE SITTING
IN THIS VERY CLASSROOM

05:33.400 --> 05:35.500
IS A JUNIOR KIERKEGAARD.

05:35.500 --> 05:36.500

05:36.500 --> 05:38.767

MR. MATTHEWS,

05:38.767 --> 05:40.300

05:40.300 --> 05:42.500
I HAVE CLEARLY
UNDERRATED YOU,

05:42.500 --> 05:44.834
AND I BOW
TO YOUR GENIUS.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.100
COME ON.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.300
BRAVO.

05:52.300 --> 05:55.200

A VERY BIG THING.

06:16.300 --> 06:19.900

06:21.300 --> 06:22.967
WELL, SHELLY FIGUS

06:22.967 --> 06:25.567

THAN YOU DO.

06:25.567 --> 06:28.300
HERE'S YOUR CHANCE
TO TRY A LITTLE HARDER.

06:29.834 --> 06:32.033
HI, MOM.
HI, WEASEL.

06:32.033 --> 06:34.200
ERIC, CAN YOU STAY
WITH MORGAN FOR AN HOUR

06:34.200 --> 06:35.300
WHILE I SHOW A HOUSE?

06:35.300 --> 06:38.233
SURE. YOU WANT TO LEARN
HOW TO BE A BIG GIRL?

06:38.233 --> 06:39.467
YEAH.

06:39.467 --> 06:41.300
BECAUSE BIG GIRLS KNOW
HOW TO TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE

06:41.300 --> 06:43.500
SO THEIR BROTHERS
DON'T HAVE TO.

06:43.500 --> 06:46.500
REALLY? YOU'D TEACH ME
HOW TO TAKE OUT THE GARBAGE?

06:46.500 --> 06:47.500
YEP.

06:47.500 --> 06:49.667

YEAH. IF YOU COULD JUST
DROP US OFF AT THE STORE,

ON HIS WAY HOME FROM WORK.

IS THAT OK
WITH YOU?

07:01.600 --> 07:03.934
I LOVE ERIC.

07:03.934 --> 07:07.133
READY?

07:07.133 --> 07:09.033

OH, HI.

07:12.900 --> 07:14.567

07:15.667 --> 07:17.300
SOMETHING TERRIBLE?

07:17.300 --> 07:18.300
OH, YEAH.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.467
ABSOLUTELY.

07:23.000 --> 07:24.033
FEENY KNOWS.

07:24.033 --> 07:25.500
SOMEHOW HE KNOWS,

07:25.500 --> 07:26.500
AND HE'S GOING
TO GET ME.

07:26.500 --> 07:27.500
YOU'RE WRONG.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.567
YOU THINK
HE'S JUST SENDING

07:28.567 --> 07:29.867
A THANK-YOU NOTE
TO MY PARENTS?

07:29.867 --> 07:32.000
"THANK YOU FOR
BRINGING UP YOUR SON.

CAPTAIN KIRKAGUARD."

07:38.934 --> 07:40.133
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:40.133 --> 07:42.767
THAT'S A SEALED ENVELOPE
ADDRESSED TO MY PARENTS.

07:42.767 --> 07:44.467
NOW THEY'RE GOING
TO KNOW I OPENED IT.

07:44.467 --> 07:47.834
COREY, DO YOUR PARENTS
EVER WRITE LETTERS TO ANYONE?

07:47.834 --> 07:49.233
YEAH.

07:49.233 --> 07:51.567
AND WHEN THEY DO, WHAT
DO THEY PUT THE LETTERS IN?

07:51.567 --> 07:53.200
ENVELOPES.

07:54.967 --> 07:56.767
JUST LIKE THIS ONE.

07:56.767 --> 07:59.233
SO WE COULD READ
THE NOTE.

07:59.233 --> 08:02.367

A NEW WHITE ENVELOPE.

THINK YOU'RE BRILLIANT?

AS LONG AS
THE TEST SAYS SO.

BUT I'M NOT, AND
MY PARENTS KNOW I'M NOT.

08:42.300 --> 08:44.767

MAKE THEM THINK YOU ARE.

MY LITTLE GIRL.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.500
THERE WERE NO
CINDERELLA COSTUMES?

11:08.500 --> 11:09.600
HUNDREDS OF THEM.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.967
AND YOU HAD TO CHOOSE
AXE IN THE HEAD HERE?

11:11.967 --> 11:13.100
IT WAS
THE LAST ONE.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.700
OOH, NICE HANGING EYEBALL.

11:14.700 --> 11:16.300
I WANTED MORGAN

11:16.300 --> 11:18.100
TO CHOOSE
HER OWN COSTUME.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.934
SHE DID CHOOSE IT, MOM.
SHE WANTED TO BE A ZOMBIE.

11:19.934 --> 11:22.967
ERIC, 24 HOURS AGO, SHE DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT A ZOMBIE WAS.

11:22.967 --> 11:25.900
THE UNDEAD ARE COOL.

11:30.667 --> 11:34.300
SHAWN, THIS WHOLE THING
IS GETTING OUT OF HAND.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.133
RELAX. EVERYBODY THINKS
YOU'RE BRILLIANT.

11:36.133 --> 11:37.133
YOU SHOULD ENJOY IT.

11:37.133 --> 11:39.367
WHEN IT WAS JUST FEENY,
I COULD ENJOY IT.

11:39.367 --> 11:40.767
BUT NOW MY PARENTS
ARE INVOLVED,

11:40.767 --> 11:42.033
AND I DON'T LIKE
LYING TO THEM.

11:42.033 --> 11:43.500
YOU DON'T?
NO.

11:43.500 --> 11:45.967
'CAUSE IT GIVES ME
A LITTLE RUSH.

11:45.967 --> 11:48.600
BESIDES, YOU DIDN'T TELL THEM
YOU WERE A GENIUS,

11:48.600 --> 11:49.700
FEENY DID.

11:49.700 --> 11:52.200
AND I DIDN'T TELL FEENY
I'M A GENIUS.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.600
THE TEST DID. AND YOU DIDN'T
ASK TO TAKE THE TEST.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.033
THEY GAVE IT TO ME.

11:57.033 --> 11:58.934
AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
EVEN SEEN THE ANSWERS...

11:58.934 --> 11:59.934
IF THEY DIDN'T
GIVE US...

11:59.934 --> 12:00.867
DETENTION.

12:00.867 --> 12:02.500
WE'RE INNOCENT
VICTIMS.

12:02.500 --> 12:04.400
NOTHING WE DO
IS ACTUALLY OUR FAULT.

12:04.400 --> 12:07.200
IT'S GOOD TO BE KIDS.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.367
I DON'T GET IT.

12:09.367 --> 12:10.600
WHAT?

12:10.600 --> 12:11.967
IF YOU'RE SMARTER
THAN I AM,

12:11.967 --> 12:13.500
HOW COME YOU'RE
ALWAYS TRYING

12:13.500 --> 12:15.100
TO COPY
FROM MY PAPER?

12:15.100 --> 12:16.100
UH...

12:16.100 --> 12:17.500
HE'S NOT COPYING,
MINKUS.

12:17.500 --> 12:19.100
HE'S JUST GLANCING
OVER TO ADMIRE

12:19.100 --> 12:20.400
THE WORK
OF A FELLOW GENIUS.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.400
YOU ARE?
HE IS.

12:21.400 --> 12:22.900
I AM.

12:22.900 --> 12:24.734
OH, WELL,
THAT'S OK.

12:24.734 --> 12:26.300
IN FACT,
FROM NOW ON,

12:26.300 --> 12:27.967
I'LL KIND OF TIP
MY TEST PAPERS UP

12:27.967 --> 12:30.233
SO YOU CAN ADMIRE
THE ANSWERS EVEN EASIER.

12:30.233 --> 12:32.600
WOULD YOU DO THAT?
NO.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.233
GENIUS ENVY.

12:36.867 --> 12:38.934
[BELL RINGS]

12:38.934 --> 12:40.700
CLASS,
THIS IS MISS CHIN.

12:40.700 --> 12:42.600
SHE'LL BE WITH YOU
FOR THE FIRST HALF-HOUR

12:42.600 --> 12:44.800
WHILE I HAVE A WORD
WITH MR. MATTHEWS.

12:48.500 --> 12:51.233
TELL MY MOM
I WENT OUT LIKE A MAN.

12:54.834 --> 12:57.567
MR. MATTHEWS,
I BROUGHT YOU DOWN HERE

12:57.567 --> 12:59.667
IN CASE
THERE WAS ANYTHING

12:59.667 --> 13:01.767
YOU CARED TO SAY TO ME.

13:01.767 --> 13:03.834
UH, ABOUT WHAT,
MR. FEENY?

13:03.834 --> 13:05.700
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

13:05.700 --> 13:07.367
SPORTS, THE WEATHER...

13:07.367 --> 13:11.000
THE INEVITABLE
RAMIFICATIONS OF DECEPTION.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.133
I CHOOSE SPORTS.

13:13.133 --> 13:14.734
TOO BAD.

13:14.734 --> 13:15.800
HOW COME?

13:15.800 --> 13:18.367
YOUR NEW SCHOOL
DOESN'T HAVE ANY.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.300
YOU KNOW,
FOR A MINUTE THERE,

13:22.300 --> 13:24.967
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
NEW SCHOOL. HA HA HA!

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
I DID.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.300
ONE THAT OFFERS
AN ENTIRE CURRICULUM

13:31.300 --> 13:33.967
GEARED TOWARD STUDENTS
LIKE YOURSELF.

13:33.967 --> 13:35.100
NO MINDLESS DISTRACTIONS

13:35.100 --> 13:38.667
SUCH AS BASEBALL,
FOOTBALL, BASKETBALL.

13:38.667 --> 13:41.900
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT DO THEY DO FOR FUN?

13:41.900 --> 13:43.133
THEY STUDY.

13:43.133 --> 13:45.100
WHAT DO THEY DO
FOR EXERCISE?

13:45.100 --> 13:47.100
THEY STUDY
TILL THEY SWEAT.

13:48.367 --> 13:50.734
NO SPORTS TEAMS
AT ALL?

13:50.734 --> 13:53.900
WELL, THEY HAVE A HIGHLY
SPIRITED CHESS TEAM.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.500
CHESS?

13:56.500 --> 13:59.500
YOU KNOW, MR. FEENY,
I'M THINKING,

13:59.500 --> 14:01.200
AS FUN
AS THAT SOUNDS,

14:01.200 --> 14:03.133
I FEEL LIKE THE SMART
KIDS AT THAT SCHOOL

14:03.133 --> 14:04.133
DON'T REALLY NEED ME.

14:04.133 --> 14:06.033
YOU AND MY FRIENDS
HERE NEED ME.

14:06.033 --> 14:08.133
OH, BUT WE'D BE
HOLDING YOU BACK.

14:08.133 --> 14:09.367
NO. YOU WOULDN'T.

14:09.367 --> 14:11.400
UM, I COULD HELP YOU
TEACH A CLASS.

14:11.400 --> 14:13.300
YOU AND I,
WE'D BE LIKE A TEAM.

14:13.300 --> 14:15.200
2 MEN WITH I.Q.s
WORKING TOGETHER

14:15.200 --> 14:17.834
FOR THE GOOD OF ALL
THESE DESERVING KIDS.

14:17.834 --> 14:21.400
NO, I THINK WE'LL JUST
HAVE TO MUDDLE THROUGH

14:21.400 --> 14:22.467
WITHOUT YOU.

14:22.467 --> 14:25.100
THE SCHOOL DISTRICT
IS COMMITTED

14:25.100 --> 14:28.467
TO GIVING GIFTED CHILDREN
EVERYTHING THEY DESERVE,

14:28.467 --> 14:30.133
AND I THINK YOU DESERVE

14:30.133 --> 14:32.400
EVERYTHING
YOU'RE GOING TO GET.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.500
I DON'T REALLY THINK
I DESERVE ANYTHING.

14:34.500 --> 14:36.133
OH, BUT ACCORDING
TO THE TEST, YOU DO.

14:36.133 --> 14:38.600
MR. FEENY, I'M
SMART ENOUGH TO KNOW

14:38.600 --> 14:40.400
YOU DON'T REALLY THINK
I'M A GENIUS.

14:40.400 --> 14:43.500
MR. MATTHEWS, IT NO LONGER
MATTERS WHAT I THINK.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.900
WHAT MATTERS IS YOU'RE
NO LONGER IN MY CLASS.

14:50.500 --> 14:51.600
DON'T YOU LOVE
HALLOWEEN?

14:51.600 --> 14:54.000
NO ONE IS WHAT
THEY SEEM TO BE.

14:59.800 --> 15:03.000
OK, I'M HERE. WHAT'S
THE BIG EMERGENCY?

15:04.367 --> 15:07.000
HEY! WHAT ARE YOU
TRYING TO DO, KILL ME?

15:07.000 --> 15:09.400
KILL YOU? I'LL TELL YOU
ABOUT KILLED.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.967
HOW ABOUT
WHAT YOU DID TO ME?

15:10.967 --> 15:12.100
WHAT'D I DO?

15:12.100 --> 15:14.100
WHERE ARE YOU SPENDING
YOUR NEXT RECESS?

15:14.100 --> 15:15.700
PLAYGROUND, SHOOTING HOOPS,
PLAYING BALL?

15:15.700 --> 15:16.700
SO?

15:16.700 --> 15:18.467
SO LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT I'M DOING.

15:18.467 --> 15:20.700
I'M SEARCHING
FOR BOBBY FISCHER!

15:22.900 --> 15:24.767
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:24.767 --> 15:26.967
GENIUSES GO
TO A SPECIAL SCHOOL.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.300
DID YOU KNOW THAT?
YOU KILLED ME.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.367
I'M GOING TO BE IN A CLASS
FULL OF MINKUSES.

15:31.367 --> 15:33.233
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT AM I TALKING ABOUT?

15:33.233 --> 15:36.133
THESE KIDS MAKE MINKUS
LOOK LIKE FABIO.

15:36.133 --> 15:37.200
WAIT A MINUTE.

15:37.200 --> 15:38.400
THEY'RE PUTTING YOU
IN ANOTHER SCHOOL?

15:38.400 --> 15:41.500
YES. THE LADY IS GOING
TO BE HERE IN A HALF AN HOUR,

15:41.500 --> 15:43.300
AND THEY'RE GOING TO GIVE ME
ANOTHER GENIUS TEST,

15:43.300 --> 15:44.867
AND THEN THEY'RE GOING
TO TAKE ME AWAY.

15:44.867 --> 15:46.567
SO I JUST CALLED YOU UP
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

15:46.567 --> 15:49.700
OR AS GENIUSES SAY,
GOOD-BYE IN LATIN.

15:49.700 --> 15:51.734
HEY, IDIOT.

15:51.734 --> 15:52.900
WHAT?

15:52.900 --> 15:54.233
ARE YOU A GENIUS?

15:54.233 --> 15:55.300
NO.

15:55.300 --> 15:57.200
DO YOU HAVE THE ANSWERS
TO THIS TEST?

15:57.200 --> 15:58.400
NO.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.300
YOU KIND OF SEE WHERE
I'M GOING WITH THIS?

16:00.300 --> 16:02.400
YOU WANT ME
TO THROW THE TEST?

16:02.400 --> 16:04.867
OH, NO, NO. I WANT YOU
TO TAKE THE TEST

16:04.867 --> 16:06.500
TO THE BEST
OF YOUR ABILITY.

16:06.500 --> 16:08.200
AND NO GUESSING.
I WOULDN'T WANT YOU

16:08.200 --> 16:10.400
TO STUMBLE
ONTO A RIGHT ANSWER.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.734
SO, MRS. MATTHEWS,
YOU'RE A HOUSEWIFE?

16:22.734 --> 16:24.367
UH, AMY'S A HOMEMAKER.

16:24.367 --> 16:26.667
SHE WRANGLES 3 KIDS,
RUNS THIS HOUSE,

16:26.667 --> 16:28.567
AND STILL MANAGES
TO SELL REAL ESTATE

16:28.567 --> 16:29.700
QUITE SUCCESSFULLY.

16:29.700 --> 16:31.100
AND I UNDERSTAND

16:31.100 --> 16:33.934
YOU WORK
IN A GROCERY STORE.

16:33.934 --> 16:35.300
WELL, ALAN IS THE MANAGER

16:35.300 --> 16:37.400
OF THE LARGEST SUPERMARKET
IN THIS WHOLE AREA.

16:37.400 --> 16:40.700
AH. TRADESMEN
ARE SO IMPORTANT

16:40.700 --> 16:43.300
AND YET
SO LITTLE RESPECTED.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.500
MOMMY?

16:47.500 --> 16:48.400
CAN I HAVE COOKIES?

16:48.400 --> 16:50.133
NO, HONEY. IT'S
TOO CLOSE TO DINNER.

16:50.133 --> 16:51.667
YOU REALIZE, DON'T YOU,

16:51.667 --> 16:53.367
THAT HER CLOTHES
DON'T MATCH?

16:53.367 --> 16:55.300
WE LET HER PICK OUT
HER OWN CLOTHES.

16:55.300 --> 16:58.300
WE FEEL IT ENCOURAGES
MORGAN'S CREATIVITY.

16:58.300 --> 17:01.700
INDEED. WELL,
IF YOURS ARE THE GENES

17:01.700 --> 17:03.867
THAT HAVE PRODUCED
OUR DARLING CORY,

17:03.867 --> 17:05.734
THEN PERHAPS
YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN

17:05.734 --> 17:06.834
WITH YOUNG MORGAN HERE.

17:06.834 --> 17:10.033
SHALL WE TRY
A WORD-ASSOCIATION PROBLEM?

17:10.033 --> 17:11.033
OK.

17:11.033 --> 17:13.700
MAPLE IS TO ELM

17:13.700 --> 17:16.200
AS DAISY IS TO...

17:16.200 --> 17:17.767
BOOGER?

17:21.300 --> 17:22.467
YOU MAY GO.

17:24.233 --> 17:25.767
CHANGE YOUR CLOTHES.

17:25.767 --> 17:27.500
GENETICS
IS SO...

17:27.500 --> 17:29.934
HIT OR MISS.

17:29.934 --> 17:31.200
ALL DONE.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.233
WHY, CORY, MOST
STUDENTS NEED

17:33.233 --> 17:35.233
AT LEAST A FULL HOUR
FOR THIS TEST.

17:35.233 --> 17:37.600
I'LL JUST GET OUT
THE ANSWER TEMPLATE.

17:37.600 --> 17:40.000
AND THAT SHOULD CONFIRM...

17:40.000 --> 17:41.734
WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW.

17:43.100 --> 17:45.033
HMM...

17:45.033 --> 17:46.800
HMM...

17:46.800 --> 17:48.200
HMM...

17:49.600 --> 17:52.033
WELL, CORY,
IF I'M TO BELIEVE

17:52.033 --> 17:53.367
THE RESULTS
OF THIS TEST,

17:53.367 --> 17:54.734
THEN YOUR I.Q.
WOULD BE

17:54.734 --> 17:58.500
ABOUT THAT OF
AN AVERAGE SIXTH GRADER.

17:58.500 --> 17:59.700
YUP, THAT'S ME.

17:59.700 --> 18:03.600
THE LIGHTS ARE ON,
BUT NOBODY'S HOME.

18:03.600 --> 18:07.467
DID YOU REALLY THINK YOU'D
GET AWAY WITH IT, CORY?

18:07.467 --> 18:10.600
NO, I GUESS I KNEW I'D BE
CAUGHT FROM THE BEGINNING.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.367
I GUESS
WE KNEW THAT, TOO.

18:12.367 --> 18:13.367
CORY CHEATED.

18:13.367 --> 18:14.500
I'M NOT A GENIUS.

18:14.500 --> 18:15.600
YOU'D LIKE US
TO BELIEVE THAT

18:15.600 --> 18:16.967
WOULDN'T YOU, CORY?

18:16.967 --> 18:18.000
HUH?
HUH?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.900
YOUR SON IS MANIFESTING
TYPICAL BEHAVIOR

18:20.900 --> 18:22.900
FOR A YOUNG GENIUS.

18:22.900 --> 18:25.867
BUT I'M NOT SMART.
LOOK AT YOUR ANSWER SHEET.

18:25.867 --> 18:28.400
IT SAYS I'M A MORON.
I KNOW IT DOES.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.033
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO LEAVE HIS OLD SCHOOL

18:30.033 --> 18:31.400
AND ALL HIS FRIENDS.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.800
THAT IS WHY YOU CHEATED
ON THIS TEST,

18:32.800 --> 18:33.934
ISN'T IT, CORY?

18:33.934 --> 18:36.000
YES. WELL, NO, BUT--

18:36.000 --> 18:38.600
LOOK, WHEN I SAID
I CHEATED,

18:38.600 --> 18:39.600
I DIDN'T MEAN THIS TEST.

18:39.600 --> 18:41.500
I MEANT THE FIRST TEST,

18:41.500 --> 18:43.867
THE ONE FEENY GAVE US
THAT SAID I WAS A GENIUS.

18:43.867 --> 18:44.867
CORY...

18:44.867 --> 18:46.500
NO. PLEASE. DON'T TALK.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.467
EVERY TIME YOU TALK,
YOU MAKE ME SOUND SMART.

18:49.567 --> 18:52.033
LOOK, MOM, DAD...

18:52.033 --> 18:53.700
I FOUND THE ANSWERS
TO FEENY'S TEST

18:53.700 --> 18:55.100
AND MEMORIZED THEM.

18:55.100 --> 18:56.567
I'M NOT A GENIUS.

18:56.567 --> 18:58.967
WE KIND OF FIGURED THAT.

18:58.967 --> 19:00.500
YOU DID?

19:00.500 --> 19:01.567
YEAH, BUT WE'RE GLAD

19:01.567 --> 19:04.500
YOU FINALLY DECIDED
TO COME CLEAN.

19:04.500 --> 19:05.867
YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

19:05.867 --> 19:08.767
BUT THERE ARE ACTUAL
PRODIGIES OUT THERE

19:08.767 --> 19:10.100
WHO DESERVE MY ATTENTION
AND RESPECT.

19:10.100 --> 19:11.467
I CAN'T WASTE MY TIME

19:11.467 --> 19:13.200
WITH NORMAL PEOPLE
LIKE YOU.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.200
WELL, YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
BUT NORMAL PEOPLE LIKE US

19:16.200 --> 19:19.100
HAVE RAISED OUR CHILDREN
TO BE NORMAL KIDS.

19:19.100 --> 19:20.400
I'M SORRY
IF THEY DON'T FIT

19:20.400 --> 19:23.200
SOME ARBITRARY INTELLECTUAL
STANDARD OF YOURS.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.200
BUT WE'RE NOT SORRY

19:24.200 --> 19:25.200
THAT THEY'RE
WELL BROUGHT UP

19:25.200 --> 19:26.700
AND COMPLETELY
NORMAL.

19:26.700 --> 19:30.400
AAH!

19:31.667 --> 19:33.367
IS THIS BETTER?

19:33.367 --> 19:36.500
SHE'S A ZOMBIE. YOU GOT
A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

19:38.200 --> 19:41.100
YOU MUST BE SO PROUD.

19:42.800 --> 19:46.100
HMM. YOU GUYS KNEW
I WASN'T A GENIUS

19:46.100 --> 19:47.367
ALL ALONG,
DIDN'T YOU?

HOW COME YOU WENT
ALONG WITH ME?

19:51.567 --> 19:54.200
WELL, CORY, WE WOULD NEVER
ACCUSE YOU OF CHEATING.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.967
WE HAD NO PROOF
THAT YOU DID.

19:56.967 --> 19:58.300
WE JUST HOPED
YOU WERE SMART ENOUGH

19:58.300 --> 20:00.800
TO TELL US THE TRUTH
EVENTUALLY.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.200
I WASN'T EVEN SMART
ENOUGH TO DO THAT

20:02.200 --> 20:04.100
UNTIL I WAS BACKED
INTO A CORNER.

DISGUISED

WHO CHEATS ON TESTS.

I WON'T.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.867
THAT COSTUME WAS
TOTALLY WRONG FOR ME.

CORY, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO EVER TRY

20:24.200 --> 20:25.734

THE BEST HE COULD.

UNDERSTAND THE MATERIAL.

TRY MY HARDEST
