{\an5}Yo.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.214
Good to see you.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.508
Hey, everybody.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.723
What a cool surprise.

01:38.807 --> 01:39.307
I missed you guys.

01:41.100 --> 01:43.770
I'm Twister. Remember me?

01:45.230 --> 01:47.023
Of course I
do, Maurice.

01:47.106 --> 01:49.526
Nice footwork back
there, Raymundo.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.194
Thanks.

01:53.696 --> 01:55.156
So, how long are you here for?

01:55.240 --> 01:56.825
{\an1}Actually, I'm heading up
to Lake Havasu

01:56.908 --> 01:58.243
for a few days
with a new line

01:58.326 --> 01:59.744
of freshwater sports gear.

01:59.828 --> 02:04.207
You know, wakeboards,
tubes, hydro-chairs.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.291
That rocks.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.043
Thought maybe you guys
could join me

02:07.126 --> 02:10.128
{\an1}and be the first
to try out the stuff.

02:10.213 --> 02:11.923
Dude, are you kidding?

02:12.006 --> 02:14.717
The King of the Wakes
has <i> got</i> to be there.

02:14.801 --> 02:15.552
For sure, that'd
be awesome.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.846
This is so cool.

02:17.929 --> 02:19.889
{\an1}We're kind of like
a scientific control group.

All right!

02:45.081 --> 02:48.543
{\an1}Check out
the gnarly gear.

02:48.626 --> 02:50.253
This baby is
calling my name.

02:50.336 --> 02:53.423
{\an1}And <i> this</i> baby
is calling mine.

Oh, I can't wait
to break <i> these</i> in.

02:56.134 --> 02:56.926
Got to admit,
it's styling.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.221
{\an1}This would be
a great opportunity

03:00.305 --> 03:02.557
to test my new data program.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.853
{\an1}I'm going to be so awesome,
I'll be off the charts.

03:06.936 --> 03:09.105
Right off the charts
in your mind.

03:10.023 --> 03:13.067
You know, I'm no
stranger to camping.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.445
They used to call me Ranger Ray
when I was younger.

03:15.528 --> 03:18.573
Huh?

03:18.656 --> 03:20.408
Can we go
wakeboarding now?

03:20.491 --> 03:21.826
Chill, Otto.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.787
We got to help set up
camp first, right, Breezy?

03:24.871 --> 03:26.289
Thanks for the offer, Reg,
but you guys go ahead.

03:26.372 --> 03:29.292
Have a good time.
We'll catch up to you.

03:29.375 --> 03:33.087
Tito, would you mind
handling boat duty?

03:34.672 --> 03:37.634
Boy, a man and his canoe can
ride the world.

03:37.717 --> 03:41.220
And a 400 horsepower motor
doesn't hurt, either.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.265
Come on, Captain Tito,
at your service.

Reggie:
Now, Sammy, remember.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.065
Raise the orange flag if I fall,
so the other boaters can see.

03:52.148 --> 03:54.817
You mean <i> when</i> you fall.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.069
Flag man, ready.

for an adventure at sea.

It's a <i> lake.</i>

04:06.955 --> 04:08.581
Eh, whatever.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.249
{\an3}Reggie:
Hit it.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.675

04:26.724 --> 04:28.142
Whoa!

04:29.769 --> 04:32.772
You know, Ranger Ray,
as soon as camp is set up

04:32.855 --> 04:35.024
we can hit the lake
with the Sea Dudes.

04:35.108 --> 04:37.026
(<i> grunting</i> ):
Almost... ready.

04:37.110 --> 04:38.861
Ha. There.

professionally pitched.

there, Reg.

We'll just see how <i> you</i> do.

Let <i> me</i> show you how it's done.

05:01.718 --> 05:05.805
All hands prepare
for radical wakeboard action.

05:11.978 --> 05:12.895

05:46.721 --> 05:48.598
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo.

Now this is how you wakeboard.

new versions

06:08.242 --> 06:10.078

controls, so you can...

So <i> I</i> can direct you

to the finish line
after you lose.

{\an1}Yeah, ready
when you are.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.254
On your mark.

06:20.338 --> 06:20.713

06:29.055 --> 06:32.350
Otto, what did you do?

06:32.433 --> 06:36.979
I didn't do anything.
This bogus board broke itself.

06:37.063 --> 06:37.980
{\an1}Isn't this
a totally rad day?

06:38.064 --> 06:41.526

way rad.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.152
Way rad?

06:43.236 --> 06:44.487
Don't you mean way lame?

06:44.570 --> 06:47.365
I fully face planted
'cause of this cruddy board.

06:47.448 --> 06:50.827

to bring us up here

{\an1}to try out
her new stuff

06:51.869 --> 06:53.913
{\an1}and we're supposed
to make her feel bad

06:53.996 --> 06:54.580
'cause <i> we</i> broke it?

06:54.664 --> 06:56.040
No way. Right, Tito?

06:56.124 --> 06:58.459
Well, little cousins,

06:58.543 --> 07:01.671
like the ancient Hawaiian
sea captains always say,

07:01.754 --> 07:02.839
"Just 'cause you're riding
the high tide

07:02.922 --> 07:06.300
doesn't mean you've chosen
the right course."

07:09.387 --> 07:11.472
Breezy:
There they are.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.683
{\an1}So how did it go?
Fill me in.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.019
{\an1}What are we supposed
to say again?

07:17.103 --> 07:18.396
{\an1}(<i> grunting</i> ):
Ow, what?

07:18.479 --> 07:20.189
It was so great.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.441
The wakeboards
were... sweet.

07:22.525 --> 07:25.027
We tore up the
water, right, guys?

07:25.111 --> 07:28.364
Yeah, it was almost
like... uh, flying.

07:28.447 --> 07:29.448
Totally rad.

07:29.532 --> 07:32.493
Everything's working out.
I'm so glad.

07:32.577 --> 07:33.536
Ray: Ha!

07:33.619 --> 07:35.454
Well, almost
everything, anyway.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.875
I'll have this baby
lit in no time.

07:38.958 --> 07:41.335
(<i> blowing</i> )

07:41.419 --> 07:44.172
Excuse me, I think Ranger Ray
needs a little help.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.673
(<i> Ray grunting</i> )

07:47.675 --> 07:48.885
Phew, now we can
hide the board.

07:48.968 --> 07:53.306
We're not just going to hide it,
we're going to fix it.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.732
Whoo-hoo!

08:02.815 --> 08:04.859

08:22.168 --> 08:24.420
Whoa!

08:24.503 --> 08:28.090
You sure you're okay in that?
Looks a little snug.

08:28.174 --> 08:31.886
Been a medium
since I was 16.

08:31.969 --> 08:34.013
In fact, it's kind of roomy.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.017
(<i> grunting</i> )

08:43.438 --> 08:45.650
(<i> grunting continues</i> )

08:46.692 --> 08:48.527
Oh, man,
what are we going to do?

08:48.611 --> 08:49.612
We're breaking all the stuff.

08:49.695 --> 08:53.366
Dudes, we're going to
be in major trouble.

08:53.449 --> 08:55.201
See? It wasn't just me.

08:55.284 --> 08:58.663
I don't think it matters.
The data doesn't lie.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.498
Okay, you guys hide the stuff.

09:00.581 --> 09:02.792
Maybe we can tell them
we're tired.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.543
At least that'll buy us
some more time.

09:06.545 --> 09:08.965
{\an4}Ray:
Hey, how you
guys doing?

09:09.048 --> 09:09.966
{\an5}Over here.

09:09.048 --> 09:09.966
You have a
good time?

09:10.049 --> 09:11.634
Uh-oh.

09:16.973 --> 09:19.934
Show 'em how it's done,
Ranger Ray.

09:22.144 --> 09:23.980
I can't watch.

09:24.063 --> 09:24.939
You're on watch duty.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.191
{\an3}Not now.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.364
Reggie, do something.

09:33.447 --> 09:34.532
Hit it.

09:38.035 --> 09:41.289
Oh, man.

09:41.372 --> 09:43.541
(<i> cracking</i> )

09:43.624 --> 09:45.334
Stop, stop!

09:45.418 --> 09:47.086
Stop the boat!

09:49.714 --> 09:52.633
Hey, oh, my...

09:55.970 --> 09:57.638
What's wrong?

09:57.722 --> 09:59.390
{\an3}Okay...

09:59.473 --> 10:01.976
See, we kind of
didn't tell you

10:02.059 --> 10:03.853
the truth
about the gear.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.688
It's... we kind
of broke it.

10:11.152 --> 10:13.195
But why didn't you say anything?

10:13.279 --> 10:16.407
Well, maybe it was
because we were too...

10:16.490 --> 10:18.951
What was the reason
again, Twist?

10:19.035 --> 10:19.869
Don't look at me.

10:19.952 --> 10:23.080
{\an1}I don't want to
get elbowed again.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.041
Oh, my!

10:25.124 --> 10:28.669
Look, this is all my fault.
I'm the one that told the guys

10:28.753 --> 10:30.129
not to say anything.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.630
{\an1}We didn't want to ruin
the vacation

10:31.714 --> 10:35.468
you brought us on
just because we were so lame.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.847
You guys aren't lame.
This stuff is.

10:39.930 --> 10:43.809
Look, bad shaping.
Here, faulty footholds.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.269
Ah, cheap straps.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.354
(<i> groans</i> )

10:46.437 --> 10:47.146
Whoa!

10:47.229 --> 10:49.565
I'm the one who should be sorry.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.775
You?

10:50.858 --> 10:53.110
If it wasn't for you,
I would have been stuck

10:53.194 --> 10:54.779
with all this bad merchandise.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.739
I'm just glad nobody got hurt.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.574
My ribs are a little sore.

10:58.657 --> 10:59.909
(<i> groans</i> )

10:59.992 --> 11:02.703
So, I guess we got
to head home, then.

11:02.787 --> 11:03.746
No way.

11:03.829 --> 11:05.373
I think
if we put our heads together,

11:05.456 --> 11:07.958
we can still have some fun.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.169
(<i> grunts</i> )
A little help here.

11:10.252 --> 11:12.588
Ow.

11:14.006 --> 11:14.673
Full speed ahead.

11:18.427 --> 11:22.890
Oh, yeah, great
design, Sammy.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.767
It's all in
the data.

11:24.850 --> 11:29.063
{\an1}Now this is definitely
"King of the Wake" style.

11:29.146 --> 11:30.439
Supremo spray action.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.234
And check out Raymundo.

11:33.317 --> 11:35.277

11:35.361 --> 11:36.946
Go, Ray. Go, Ray.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.155

12:15.526 --> 12:17.027
Score.

12:17.111 --> 12:17.820
It's clutch.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.488
(<i> tires squealing</i> )

12:19.572 --> 12:21.407
Oops, sorry.

12:23.701 --> 12:24.827
Come on, Sammy.

12:24.910 --> 12:26.454
Are you going to be a squid
your whole life?

12:26.537 --> 12:30.166
{\an5}Woman:
I can answer that.

12:30.249 --> 12:32.168
Who are you?

12:32.251 --> 12:33.544
Excellent question.

12:33.627 --> 12:37.006
Allow me to answer
telepathically.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.674
Excuse me, but
telepathy has

12:38.757 --> 12:40.342
been scientifically disproven.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.218
Shh! Just you shush.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.179
Wee-ooh.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.388
Patsy.

12:44.472 --> 12:48.350
Wee-ooh, wee-ooh.

12:48.434 --> 12:49.518
Patsy.

12:49.602 --> 12:51.187
(<i> whispering</i> ):
Patsy.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.354
{\an4}Wee-ooh...

12:51.270 --> 12:52.354
Uh, Patsy?

12:52.438 --> 12:53.522
Yes!

12:53.606 --> 12:55.483
You have just witnessed

12:55.566 --> 12:58.777
{\an1}the mental power of Patsy--
Fortune Teller

12:58.861 --> 13:01.697
and Telepathic Wonder Chick.

13:01.780 --> 13:02.114
But you said Patsy.

13:02.198 --> 13:04.200
{\an1}<i>Quiet!</i>

13:04.283 --> 13:07.161
I'm getting a very strong signal
from you.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.288
I will now contact
the lumps on your head.

13:09.371 --> 13:10.539
Wee...

13:10.623 --> 13:14.210
{\an1}Oh, oh, oh,
this is terrible.

13:14.293 --> 13:15.336
What is it?

13:15.419 --> 13:17.463
I broke a nail.

13:17.546 --> 13:18.881
As for your future--
fame, fortune

13:18.964 --> 13:20.049
and many endorsements
will be yours.

13:20.132 --> 13:22.051
Next!

13:22.134 --> 13:22.676
{\an3}All right!

13:22.760 --> 13:25.137
Oh,<i> please.</i>

13:25.221 --> 13:27.473
{\an1}Uh, will my brother Lars
always push me around?

13:27.556 --> 13:28.724
Well, let's ask him.

13:28.807 --> 13:33.062
(<i> making nonsense sounds</i> )

13:33.145 --> 13:34.480
(<i> gasps</i> )

13:34.563 --> 13:36.815
(<i> in deep voice</i> ):
Hello, it's me, Lars.

13:36.899 --> 13:41.153
I will leave the house,
and you will rule the household.

13:41.237 --> 13:42.655
Yeah! All right!

13:42.738 --> 13:43.822
{\an1}Wait.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.241
What happened? Who am I?

13:45.324 --> 13:46.367
How long was I gone?

13:46.450 --> 13:47.785
What about me?

13:47.868 --> 13:51.455
Will I be an internationally
renowned extreme sport expert?

13:51.539 --> 13:53.290
Call it.

13:53.374 --> 13:54.917
{\an3}Heads.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.669
It's tails.

13:56.752 --> 13:57.836
Oh.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.379
Oh, come on, toots.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.339
Tails means yes.

14:00.422 --> 14:01.632
{\an1}You're in.

14:01.715 --> 14:02.800
Yeah.

14:02.883 --> 14:03.384
All right, Reg.

14:03.467 --> 14:05.803
This is bogus.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.179
Endorsements?

14:07.263 --> 14:08.180
International fame?

14:08.264 --> 14:09.348
Get real.

14:09.431 --> 14:10.724
What's with squatty?

14:10.808 --> 14:12.268
It's Squid.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.602
Squid? Give me your specs.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.521
I'll read the smudges for you.

14:15.604 --> 14:17.147
You can't predict
the future.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.357
Come on, Sammy.

14:18.440 --> 14:18.941
Let her
read them.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.901
It'll be fun.

14:20.985 --> 14:22.528
Have no fear.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.573
The glasses say <i> you</i> are

14:25.656 --> 14:28.617
indestructible.

14:28.701 --> 14:31.620
Okeydokey, that'll be 25 cents,
please.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.914
All right, Squid!

14:36.041 --> 14:37.501
(<i> laughs</i> ):
Whoa!

14:37.585 --> 14:39.169
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:39.253 --> 14:40.212
Whoa, whoa.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.464
Whoa.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.675
Wow, that
was close, Squid.

14:44.758 --> 14:45.968
(<i> bicycle bell dings</i> )

14:46.051 --> 14:48.470
Whoa, dude,
that was totally whacked.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.431
Sorry about the bikes.

14:50.514 --> 14:51.473
That's cool, bro.

14:51.557 --> 14:52.474
I'm totally stoked
on your skills.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.851
Here's a sticker
with the

14:53.934 --> 14:56.812
store's logo.
Wear it on your helmet

14:56.895 --> 14:58.731
and I'll cut you
a discount, dude.

14:58.814 --> 15:01.692
You mean you want me
to endorse your store?

15:01.775 --> 15:03.485
It's just like Patsy predicted.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.487
It is not.

15:07.656 --> 15:10.576
Whoa! Sorry, Sammy.

15:10.659 --> 15:11.994
Good thing you ducked.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.370
I almost destroyed you.

15:13.454 --> 15:14.830
Yeah.

15:14.913 --> 15:15.998
Good thing.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.041
{\an3}Hey, Reg.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.542
The article you wrote

15:18.626 --> 15:21.462
on grinding government buildings
was <i> majorly</i> cool.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.172
In fact, I'm going to e-mail it

15:23.255 --> 15:23.881
to my friend in Canada.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.800
Wow, Patsy was right!

15:26.884 --> 15:29.345
Reg is going international.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.387
What do you think
of Patsy now?

15:30.471 --> 15:32.681
Oh, coincidences.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.058
Happens all the time.

15:36.018 --> 15:38.520
Man:
<i>Wow, Patsy predicted all that?</i>

15:38.604 --> 15:40.356
Spooky.

15:40.439 --> 15:42.858
{\an1}The ancient Hawaiians
used to say

15:42.941 --> 15:44.401
"Man who tries to predict

15:44.485 --> 15:48.656
when volcano will blow is
usually toast by next day."

15:48.739 --> 15:49.740
That reminds me.

15:49.823 --> 15:51.408
Can you pick up the hot dog buns
tomorrow?

15:51.492 --> 15:54.370
Hmm, let me ask

15:54.453 --> 15:55.537
the magic coconut.

15:58.582 --> 16:01.543
Ask again later.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.880
Come on, guys.

16:04.963 --> 16:07.341
Your predictions didn't <i> really</i>
come true.

16:07.424 --> 16:08.384
Maybe you're right, Sammy.

16:08.467 --> 16:10.552
But what difference
does it make?

16:10.636 --> 16:11.553
{\an1}It's fun.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.805
Guess what?

16:12.888 --> 16:15.557
Mom and Dad are sending Lars
to Tough Care Camp

16:15.641 --> 16:16.475
which means
I rule for three weeks.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.977
All right, Twister.

16:19.061 --> 16:21.730
Just coincidence,
right, Squid?

16:21.814 --> 16:26.068
Or should we call you
"Indestructible Squid?"

16:26.151 --> 16:26.568
(<i> laughter</i> )

16:26.652 --> 16:28.028
{\an5}Oh-ho.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.028
Yeah.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.949
Sammy:
<i>First the bikes</i>

16:32.032 --> 16:34.993
then Trish, then...

16:36.537 --> 16:37.746

16:37.830 --> 16:39.289
Look out!

16:40.416 --> 16:41.542

Oh, sorry, sorry.

Excuse me.

{\an1}Boy:
Whoa!

17:13.991 --> 17:15.534
You're, like, unbelievable.

17:15.617 --> 17:17.911
I think you mean

17:17.994 --> 17:19.121
indestructible.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.838
{\an1}Otto:
Hey, Squid.

17:27.921 --> 17:29.882
We're practicing
heavy grindage.

17:29.965 --> 17:32.426
I'll let you go first
if you think you're up to it.

17:32.509 --> 17:34.511
Watch and learn, dude.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.263
Watch and learn.

17:41.894 --> 17:42.978
{\an3}Whoa!

17:43.061 --> 17:43.979
Way to go, Sam.

17:44.062 --> 17:45.314
{\an5}All right!

17:44.062 --> 17:45.314
All right!

17:45.397 --> 17:47.066
Wow, Squid, that was amazing.

17:47.149 --> 17:51.695
{\an1}Like Patsy says,
I am indestructible.

17:51.779 --> 17:54.323
{\an5}I thought you
didn't buy into
all that stuff.

17:54.406 --> 17:56.241
That was before I got wise.

17:56.325 --> 17:57.910
Now if you'll excuse me

17:57.993 --> 18:00.996
I see some serious grinding
in my future.

18:05.584 --> 18:06.668
Whoa!

18:06.752 --> 18:08.337
Surf looks rough today.

18:08.420 --> 18:12.674
{\an3}Well, then maybe you should
just sit this one out.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.259
It's go time.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.098
Reggie:
What does he think he's doing?

18:20.182 --> 18:22.851
He's not going
to take that big wave, is he?

18:22.935 --> 18:24.061
He won't.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.312
He wouldn't.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.647
He is.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.192
Whoa!

18:30.275 --> 18:31.193
{\an3}He's up.

18:31.276 --> 18:31.652
(<i> Sammy screaming</i> )

18:31.735 --> 18:32.569
{\an1}He's down.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.363
No, wait, he's....

18:34.446 --> 18:35.531
Oh, oh!

18:35.614 --> 18:36.657
He's...

18:37.699 --> 18:39.451
Yee-ha!

18:39.535 --> 18:41.203
He's indestructible.

18:43.580 --> 18:45.666
Go, Sammy.

18:45.749 --> 18:46.959
That was a 12-footer, Squid.

18:47.042 --> 18:49.336
Do you know how
lucky you are

18:49.419 --> 18:52.256
{\an5}that you didn't
kill yourself
out there?

18:52.339 --> 18:54.967
Talk to the smudges,
girlfriend.

18:56.510 --> 18:58.178
{\an1}Did he just call me
"girlfriend?"

19:09.815 --> 19:12.234

19:12.317 --> 19:12.776
{\an1}Lars:
Game over, dorks.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.570
We need the field.

19:14.653 --> 19:18.740
{\an5}What are you doing here?
I thought you were at
Tough Care Camp.

19:18.824 --> 19:22.536
I graduated early
for bad behavior.

19:22.619 --> 19:24.329
We were here
first, Lars.

19:24.413 --> 19:26.415
Well, I'm here now.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.416
So take off.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.626
{\an4}Sammy:
Not so fast, chump.

19:29.710 --> 19:33.130
Why don't you
and your jelly fish posse

19:33.213 --> 19:35.924
be smart and move along?

19:36.008 --> 19:36.925

19:37.009 --> 19:38.468
What did you say?

19:38.552 --> 19:39.720
Did I stutter?

19:38.552 --> 19:39.720
{\an1}Huh?

19:39.803 --> 19:41.471
Sammy, what are you doing?

19:41.555 --> 19:42.723
{\an1}(<i> laughs</i> )

19:42.806 --> 19:44.057
This is a set-up, isn't it?

19:44.141 --> 19:46.560
{\an1}You're trying
to get me in trouble

19:46.643 --> 19:49.062
{\an1}so they'll send me back
to Tough Care Camp.

19:49.146 --> 19:50.689
Well, I'm not falling
for it.

19:50.772 --> 19:53.108
Let's go, guys.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.651
I won't forget this.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.445
Reggie:
Go, Sammy!

19:56.528 --> 19:57.821
All right!

19:57.905 --> 19:59.573
{\an5}That was awesome, man.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.573
Our hero!

19:59.656 --> 20:02.409
Whoa, Squid, if I
didn't know you

20:02.492 --> 20:02.951
{\an3}I'd say you
were cool.

20:03.035 --> 20:04.036
Wait 'till you see

20:04.119 --> 20:06.788
what Sammy does for an encore.

20:06.872 --> 20:10.334
I predict huge trouble ahead.

20:12.085 --> 20:14.463
Reggie:
Anybody seen Squid?

20:14.546 --> 20:16.256
I'm kind of worried about him.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.799
I haven't seen him all day.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.092
Chill out, Reg.

20:19.176 --> 20:20.218
Sammy's a new man.

20:20.302 --> 20:22.596
I say we let him go, go, go.

20:22.679 --> 20:23.972
(<i> laughing</i> ):
Yeah.

20:24.056 --> 20:28.226
Hey, Otter, I need
my sticker back.

20:28.310 --> 20:28.769
I got a new guy.

What?! Who?

20:33.523 --> 20:35.692
{\an8}See Sammy the Indestructible

{\an8}jump the bowl at Madtown Park
today?

20:39.237 --> 20:40.781
(<i> grunting</i> )

20:42.950 --> 20:44.326
{\an1}Otto (<i> breathless</i> ):
Patsy.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.370
No refunds.
I already spent your money.

20:46.453 --> 20:47.037
You got to help us.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.121
Okay, not a problem.

20:48.205 --> 20:51.750
Wee-ooh! Okay, there,
problem solved.

20:51.833 --> 20:53.168
35 cents, please.

20:53.251 --> 20:55.921
Patsy, Sammy's going to try
to jump the bowl at Madtown.

20:56.004 --> 20:59.174
He thinks he's indestructible.

20:59.257 --> 21:01.718
Well, what <i> idiot</i> gave him
that idea?

21:01.802 --> 21:03.512
Uh, you did.

21:04.846 --> 21:05.931
You got to help us.

21:06.014 --> 21:08.684
If you don't,
Sammy could really get hurt.

21:08.767 --> 21:09.935
It's impossible.

21:10.018 --> 21:13.897
No one can change
what has already been predicted.

21:13.981 --> 21:17.359
We got 42 cents and a gum ball.

21:17.442 --> 21:19.778
Hmm, let's go.

21:20.278 --> 21:23.031
Yeah, go, Sammy.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.701
{\an5}-Way to go, buddy.
-All right!
-Yeah!

21:25.784 --> 21:28.787
(<i> crowd cheering</i> )

21:29.371 --> 21:30.872
{\an1}Reggie:
Sammy...

21:30.956 --> 21:31.665
wait!

21:31.748 --> 21:34.251
Hey, you're just in time.

21:34.334 --> 21:36.044
Kid, don't jump.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.587
It's about your fortune.

21:37.671 --> 21:42.217
I may have embellished
just a tiny little part of it.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.094
Which part?

21:44.177 --> 21:46.054
The indestructible part.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.055
Relax, Patsy.

21:47.139 --> 21:48.307
You said it yourself.

21:48.390 --> 21:49.599
The smudges
do not lie, remember?

21:49.683 --> 21:54.229
Geez, why can't I learn
to keep my big pie hole shut.

21:55.605 --> 21:57.482
Okay, squatty, take a look.

22:01.778 --> 22:03.905
Sammy:
"Indestructible."

22:03.989 --> 22:06.283
You mean... you mean...
I wasn't really

22:06.366 --> 22:08.577
and when I did the grind, I...

22:08.660 --> 22:10.037
and the big wave

22:10.120 --> 22:11.747
and what I told Lars?

22:11.830 --> 22:13.832
That's right.

22:13.915 --> 22:16.877
{\an1}You did all of those things
by yourself.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.754
{\an1}The future is
whatever <i> you</i> make of it.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.423
Oh!

22:21.506 --> 22:22.716
(<i> thud</i> )

22:25.177 --> 22:28.472
That'll be a quarter, please.

22:30.098 --> 22:31.933
{\an1}Reggie:
Sure glad we made it in time.

22:32.017 --> 22:32.642
{\an1}Me, too.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.561
If you had cleared that jump

22:34.644 --> 22:36.354
I would have had to move away.

22:36.438 --> 22:39.524
Still, all those coincidences--
they were pretty spooky.

22:39.608 --> 22:43.320
I never really believed
I was indestructible.

22:46.656 --> 22:47.157
Ow!

22:47.240 --> 22:50.077
All:
Oh!

22:56.958 --> 23:00.837
(<i> rock music playing</i> )

23:38.041 --> 23:40.919
{\an8}Sammy: <i> Did I stutter?</i>
