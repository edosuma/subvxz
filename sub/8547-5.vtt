Thank you, Detective.

10:40.212 --> 10:41.461
Can I ask you guys
a question?

10:41.463 --> 10:42.829
Shoot.

10:42.831 --> 10:44.214
Honestly, what do you think?
This guy Tanner,

10:44.216 --> 10:45.999
he have a partner,
or is this some sort of copycat?

10:46.001 --> 10:47.250
Well, there's another
possibility.

10:47.252 --> 10:49.219
What if Tanner had nothing
to do with it at all?

10:49.221 --> 10:50.754
M.O. that specific,

10:50.756 --> 10:53.507
that usually belongs
to a single unsub acting alone.

10:53.509 --> 10:56.176
Come on. They found pictures of the
Wilcox kid in his apartment.

10:56.178 --> 10:57.928
Surveillance photos only.
And there were pictures

10:57.930 --> 10:59.563
of other boys and they're
all alive and well.

10:59.565 --> 11:01.064
But he confessed.

11:01.066 --> 11:04.518
What he's saying is that psychos say
the darnedest things.

11:04.520 --> 11:06.186
Everything that
comes out of their mouth

11:06.188 --> 11:07.737
has to be taken
with a grain of salt,

11:07.739 --> 11:09.189
even if it's a confession.

11:09.191 --> 11:11.358
We'll know more
after we talk to him.

11:11.360 --> 11:14.177
And that was it.

11:14.179 --> 11:16.379
I was done with him.

11:16.381 --> 11:19.449
So I let him go.

11:19.451 --> 11:22.152
You weren't concerned
that he'd be able to identify you?

11:22.154 --> 11:23.370
[Chuckles]

11:23.372 --> 11:26.256

live long enough.

11:26.258 --> 11:28.208
I made sure of it.

11:29.378 --> 11:31.711
All right, listen, Rodney,
I'm gonna get right to it.

11:31.713 --> 11:32.901
I hate prisons.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.349
I don't want to be here
longer than I have to be.

11:34.349 --> 11:35.882
Ooh. Amen to that.

11:35.884 --> 11:39.219
See, the truth us,
we don't think you did it.

11:40.889 --> 11:44.474
I guess it doesn't matter
what you think,

11:44.476 --> 11:46.443
now, does it?

11:46.445 --> 11:48.445

[Exhales]

11:52.117 --> 11:53.900
Maybe.

11:53.902 --> 11:55.735
Why?

12:01.243 --> 12:03.577
We're gonna take that
as a no,

12:03.579 --> 12:06.046
and you should
consider decaf.

12:06.048 --> 12:07.464
We're done here.

12:07.466 --> 12:08.548
Wait. What?

12:08.550 --> 12:10.250
We also watched
your taped confession,

12:10.252 --> 12:11.835
and that nervous knee
thing you're doing--

12:11.837 --> 12:13.420
you never stopped
doing it then.

12:13.422 --> 12:15.055
It's called a tell,
Rodney,

12:15.057 --> 12:16.890
and the reason you were doing it
is you were under stress

12:16.892 --> 12:17.974
and making up a lie.

12:17.976 --> 12:19.976
But today you give
the exact same confession,

12:19.978 --> 12:21.845
but that knee,
it's not moving at all.

12:21.847 --> 12:24.731
Not until we showed you
that picture.

12:24.733 --> 12:26.099
No, I had pictures.

12:26.101 --> 12:27.851
I took pictures of him.

12:27.853 --> 12:30.570
Yeah, well, that just makes
you a garden variety whack job.

12:30.572 --> 12:32.322
No way that
you abducted anyone.

12:32.324 --> 12:34.107
Rodney, we're gonna recommend
that you be resentenced,

12:34.109 --> 12:36.193
but in the meantime, they're probably
gonna take you out of protective custody

12:36.195 --> 12:37.744
and put you into
general population.

Tanner: I did it.

12:43.785 --> 12:45.785
It was me.

12:45.787 --> 12:48.171
Wait!

12:48.173 --> 12:49.506
Just got off the phone
with Morgan.

12:49.508 --> 12:51.291
Tanner didn't take
either of those boys

12:51.293 --> 12:53.710
and he doesn't have a partner.
He was attention seeking.

12:53.712 --> 12:55.378
So it's a single unsub.

12:55.380 --> 12:57.264
Wow. A pedophile
willing to go to prison

12:57.266 --> 12:59.883

13:04.223 --> 13:05.689
He's still sedated.

13:05.691 --> 13:07.524
Even if he weren't, he's in
pretty bad shape mentally.

13:07.526 --> 13:08.942
I doubt he'd be able
to give us much.

13:08.944 --> 13:09.893
Excuse me, agents.

13:09.895 --> 13:11.194

the word out.

this one text.

aren't gonna eat themselves.

13:31.583 --> 13:33.667

I hate them.

13:33.669 --> 13:36.803
Because I'm your mother, and
your suffering is very important to me.

you mostly can't go.

21:10.606 --> 21:11.771
Nobody saw anything.

21:11.773 --> 21:13.607
Even if they did,
it's Halloween.

21:13.609 --> 21:15.191
He could be in costume.

21:15.193 --> 21:17.661
We could be looking
for Sponge Bob for all we know.

[JJ whistles]

21:18.680 --> 21:20.664
Hello over there.
Share, please.

21:20.666 --> 21:23.700
Hey, kid, speak your mind.

21:23.702 --> 21:26.253
The transcripts. Sorry, the transcripts
of the police interview

21:26.255 --> 21:28.755
with the first victim's
mother, Charlotte Wilcox, I read them.

21:28.757 --> 21:29.789
And?

21:29.791 --> 21:31.291
Mrs. Wilcox, do you remember
anything unusual

21:31.293 --> 21:32.626
about the night
Tommy disappeared?

21:32.628 --> 21:33.877
No, nothing.
Are you absolutely sure?

21:33.879 --> 21:35.028
There's nothing.
Anything might help.

21:35.030 --> 21:36.880
I don't know.
Toilet paper maybe.

21:36.882 --> 21:38.465
Sorry, ma'am?
I went to the store to buy toilet paper

21:38.467 --> 21:39.633
and when I got back
I couldn't find it.

21:39.635 --> 21:40.967
But what could that
have to do with anything?

21:40.969 --> 21:42.469
Oh, god, I can't believe
this is happening.

21:42.471 --> 21:44.187
Tommy took
the toilet paper.

21:44.189 --> 21:45.272
He was out Tping houses.

21:45.274 --> 21:47.724
Hunter Olson
was egging houses.

21:47.726 --> 21:50.026
Joshua Parker had
disciplinary problems.

21:50.028 --> 21:51.711
Bad boys all around.

21:51.713 --> 21:54.314
We should deliver
the profile.

21:54.316 --> 21:56.149
Based on the details
of the abduction,

21:56.151 --> 21:59.235
we believe we're looking for a white male
in his mid-20s to early 30s.

21:59.237 --> 22:00.654
He's fixated on Halloween,

22:00.656 --> 22:02.155
and we think
it's probably related

22:02.157 --> 22:04.491
to a traumatic event
from his childhood.

22:04.493 --> 22:06.793
You really think he's doing all this
just to punish these kids

22:06.795 --> 22:07.911
for egging houses?

22:07.913 --> 22:09.913
It's his version
of punishment, but yes.

22:09.915 --> 22:12.499
Apparently that aspect
of Halloween agitates him.

22:12.501 --> 22:15.819
We're classifying him as something called
a fundamentalist vigilante.

22:15.821 --> 22:18.138
Because Halloween traditions
are rooted in Christianity,

22:18.140 --> 22:21.424
there's a chance he may be some kind
of religious zealot.

22:21.426 --> 22:24.594
He releases his victims
on a consistent timeline.

22:24.596 --> 22:26.646
That says that
he's mission oriented.

22:26.648 --> 22:27.814
Let me out!

[Pounding]

22:28.817 --> 22:30.900
Aah! [Groans]

22:30.902 --> 22:32.936
Kate: For him it's all about
the punishment itself.

22:32.938 --> 22:34.904
Rossi: Which is why
he releases them.

22:34.906 --> 22:36.272
What's the point
of punishment

22:36.274 --> 22:38.908
if they're not gonna be around
to learn their lesson?

22:38.910 --> 22:40.276
He may be from
a broken home,

22:40.278 --> 22:42.612
and we wouldn't be surprised
if there were violence or abuse.

22:42.614 --> 22:45.782
And we're fairly certain that
his home life was exceedingly strict.

22:45.784 --> 22:47.334
JJ: As a kid,
it's a pretty good bet

22:47.336 --> 22:49.502
he had disciplinary issues.

22:49.504 --> 22:52.455
Hotch: And interpersonal relationships
would still be a problem for him.

22:52.457 --> 22:55.291
JJ: He's the kind of guy
that would snap when rejected.

22:55.293 --> 22:57.293
This guy needs space
to do what he does.

22:57.295 --> 22:58.628
But less than
you might think.

22:58.630 --> 23:00.130
Ariel Castro held
3 women hostage

23:00.132 --> 23:01.848
in the middle of
a residential area for years.

23:01.850 --> 23:04.517
But he has to work to eat and
to subsidize that space,

23:04.519 --> 23:05.935
so he most likely
has a job.

23:05.937 --> 23:07.771
It would be a blue collar one
he can do alone.

23:07.773 --> 23:09.439
Truck driver
or night watchman,

23:09.441 --> 23:11.524
plumber, maybe even
electrician.

23:11.526 --> 23:13.360
If anyone you know
fits this description,

23:13.362 --> 23:15.729
or if you have any information
regarding the whereabouts of Hunter Olson,

23:15.731 --> 23:18.148
please call the FBI
hotline number at the--

23:27.159 --> 23:31.461
Hey. Garcia's going through
the hotline calls. So far no leads.

23:31.463 --> 23:33.963
Agent Hotchner,
there's a lady here who's insisting

23:33.965 --> 23:36.049
she talk to the FBI agent
she saw on TV.

23:36.051 --> 23:38.985
Our guys tried to talk to her,
but she's not taking no for an answer.

23:38.987 --> 23:40.837
Excuse me.

23:41.723 --> 23:44.340
I'm Agent Hotchner.
How can I help you?

23:44.342 --> 23:47.177
I called the hotline,but I figured
I should just come in.

23:47.179 --> 23:50.096
I saw the news and...

23:50.098 --> 23:53.750
I think the one
who kidnapped those boys...

23:53.752 --> 23:56.903
I'm pretty sure
it's my brother.

24:09.895 --> 24:12.929
Are you
and your brother close?

24:12.931 --> 24:16.900
We're like 5 years apart,
so not so much.

24:16.902 --> 24:20.387
And plus he's always
been kind of...

24:20.389 --> 24:22.956
I don't know, a freak.

24:22.958 --> 24:24.491
How so?

24:24.493 --> 24:27.460
He used to lock me
in closets.

24:27.462 --> 24:29.596
Or sometimes smother me.

24:29.598 --> 24:32.298
Once when I was 10,
my mom smelled something

24:32.300 --> 24:33.583
out by the garbage.

24:33.585 --> 24:36.269
And she found like
10 cats and dogs

24:36.271 --> 24:38.605
stuffed into boxes
in the dumpster.

24:38.607 --> 24:40.473
And you think
your brother killed them?

24:40.475 --> 24:42.542
He admitted it.

24:42.544 --> 24:44.244
And laughed.

24:44.246 --> 24:45.912
What makes you so sure
that your brother

24:45.914 --> 24:47.914
is the one we should
be looking for?

24:47.916 --> 24:50.216
Because the night
my dad left,

24:50.218 --> 24:51.718
it was Halloween,
and on the news

24:51.720 --> 24:54.904
you guys said that
that was important.

24:54.906 --> 24:56.439
What happened?

24:56.441 --> 24:59.392
My mom was working.

24:59.394 --> 25:03.480
But my dad, he wouldn't let us
trick-or-treat.

25:03.482 --> 25:07.634
He said all that candy
would rot our teeth and make us fat.

25:09.071 --> 25:12.305
He was kind of scary,
my dad.

25:12.307 --> 25:14.441
In what way?

25:15.444 --> 25:18.044
He hit my mom.

25:18.046 --> 25:20.413
Us, too.

25:20.415 --> 25:25.051
And he was super strict,
yelled all the time.

25:25.053 --> 25:29.389
And did that whole
church-every-Sunday hypocrite thing.

25:31.510 --> 25:35.261
We were always getting
punished for something.

25:35.263 --> 25:37.931
Johnny really caught it
that night.

25:37.933 --> 25:39.599
You stay away from him.

25:39.601 --> 25:41.434
You, you come here right now.

You, right now!

25:42.938 --> 25:44.104

25:47.943 --> 25:49.609

25:50.912 --> 25:52.529

I'm sorry!

25:52.531 --> 25:53.913
Shut up!

25:53.915 --> 25:55.915
You weren't so sorry
when you were egging that house.

25:55.917 --> 25:58.668
You go to your room!

25:58.670 --> 26:01.287
Get in the trunk!

26:01.289 --> 26:03.406

26:04.759 --> 26:06.793
He kept yelling
he would keep him there

26:06.795 --> 26:10.163
till next Halloween
to teach him a lesson.

26:11.516 --> 26:16.186
My mom got home
and lost it.

26:16.188 --> 26:20.256

I hid under my bed.

26:23.812 --> 26:26.779

and my dad was gone.

on him a couple of times, even.

26:54.926 --> 26:56.342
For what?

26:56.344 --> 26:59.395
Uh, police report says she wanted
him removed from the premises.

26:59.397 --> 27:01.397
But she dropped the charges
both times.

27:01.399 --> 27:02.799
Do have have a current
address for him?

27:02.801 --> 27:04.834
Last one was a P.O. Box.

27:04.836 --> 27:06.202
The IRS must be
after him, too.

27:06.204 --> 27:08.104
He hasn't filed taxes
in 3 years.

27:08.106 --> 27:10.356
3 years. That's the last
time he saw his sister.

27:10.358 --> 27:11.741
So what happened
3 years ago?

27:11.743 --> 27:13.293
Yeah, I'm looking.
For the last year

27:13.295 --> 27:15.361
he's worked as a driver
for a courier company.

27:15.363 --> 27:17.280
Nothing there.
Hold yourself.

27:17.282 --> 27:20.149
Huh. He applied for
a marriage license 3 years ago.

27:20.151 --> 27:24.487
He was engaged to a one
Charlene Taylor, who--

27:24.489 --> 27:26.206
Oh, this is awkward.
Her name's now Charlene Baker

27:26.208 --> 27:27.924
because she married
someone else.

27:27.926 --> 27:29.542
That could have been
the trigger.

27:29.544 --> 27:32.212
The rejection and rage
that made him feel alone, worthless,

27:32.214 --> 27:34.264
same way as dad
used to make him feel.

27:34.266 --> 27:36.349
So why not punish
father figures instead?

27:36.351 --> 27:38.851
Maybe he's trying to regain
a sense of power and control

27:38.853 --> 27:40.637
by reenacting
what his father did to him.

27:40.639 --> 27:43.273
I guess we all become our parents
at some point.

27:43.275 --> 27:45.441
He's also making good
on his dad's threat

27:45.443 --> 27:47.060
to keep him locked up
till next Halloween.

27:47.062 --> 27:49.279
That was 12 years ago.
What was it about that night

27:49.281 --> 27:51.147
that made such
a lasting imprint?

27:51.149 --> 27:52.565
It was the night
his parents split.

his dad yet?

No, you're not.
You're hiding something.

31:41.596 --> 31:47.667
Mrs. Bidwell, we can't seem to find
your ex-husband Sam anywhere.

for me again.

32:08.740 --> 32:10.156
Ok.

32:10.158 --> 32:11.824
Now, what's the first thing

32:11.826 --> 32:15.328
you remember happening
that night?

32:16.631 --> 32:19.665
I could hear the screaming

32:19.667 --> 32:23.503
before I even got in the door.

32:23.505 --> 32:26.088
And I come in

32:26.090 --> 32:31.561
and Sam is yelling
at this old trunk of his.

32:31.563 --> 32:33.980
You're gonna stay in this trunk
till next Halloween!

32:33.982 --> 32:34.982
You hear me?!

32:34.983 --> 32:36.482
Sam, what are you doing?

32:36.484 --> 32:37.484

32:47.662 --> 32:49.529
I tried to get him out,

32:49.531 --> 32:52.532
but Sam hit me.

32:52.534 --> 32:55.868
But this time...

32:55.870 --> 32:59.939
this time, I fought back.

32:59.941 --> 33:02.291
What happened then, Mary?

33:02.293 --> 33:05.962
He had his back to me.

33:05.964 --> 33:08.297
And I picked up a fire poker...

33:08.299 --> 33:10.099

out of that damn trunk.

lying on the floor.

33:25.733 --> 33:27.783
You ok?

33:27.785 --> 33:29.785
Ohh, my baby.

33:29.787 --> 33:32.905
And then we dragged him out.

33:32.907 --> 33:37.293
There was so much blood.

33:37.295 --> 33:39.912
He helped me.

33:51.309 --> 33:53.759
Mary, listen to me.

33:53.761 --> 33:55.344
It was self-defense.

Yes, you were just
protecting yourself and your kids.
