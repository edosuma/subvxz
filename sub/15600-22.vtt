17:43.896 --> 17:47.733
A BEST FRIENDS MERIT BADGE!

17:47.816 --> 17:50.819
FORGED FROM SOLID PALTONIUM
FROM THE CORE

17:50.903 --> 17:52.988
OF THE PLANET COMRADIA.

17:53.071 --> 17:55.407
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP IT
IN A LEAD-LINED CHEST.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.494
IT'S DANGEROUSLY RADIOACTIVE.

17:58.577 --> 17:59.578
NOW FOLLOW ME.

17:59.661 --> 18:02.664
I'VE GOT A SPECIAL TREAT
FOR YOU GUYS.

18:02.748 --> 18:03.874
[humming]

18:03.957 --> 18:06.001
- WE HAVE TO TELL HIM
THAT WE WANT TO LEAVE!

18:06.085 --> 18:08.796
- BUT WE'LL BREAK HIS HEART!

18:08.879 --> 18:12.674
MAYBE THERE'S A WAY TO LEAVE
WITHOUT HIM KNOWING--

18:12.758 --> 18:14.593
- THERE SHE IS, BOYS!

18:14.676 --> 18:16.345
[both gasp]

18:16.428 --> 18:18.555
- ISN'T SHE A BEAUTY?

18:18.639 --> 18:20.516
- UH-HUH.
WHAT IS IT?

18:20.599 --> 18:22.935
- A THUNDER-RUMPED ICE YAK!

18:23.018 --> 18:24.102
[yak snorts]

18:24.186 --> 18:27.147
- I'M GONNA TEACH YOU
HOW TO MILK HER!

18:27.231 --> 18:28.816
NOW FIRST THING
WE'LL NEED IS A PAIL.

18:28.899 --> 18:31.485
- UGH!
- EW!

18:31.568 --> 18:34.363
- OOH! I KNOW
JUST WHERE TO GET ONE!

18:34.446 --> 18:36.281
- HUH?

18:36.365 --> 18:39.326
- ALL RIGHT!
LET'S GET TO IT!

18:39.409 --> 18:41.870
SHE OUGHT TO BE DOCILE,
BECAUSE I HYPNOTIZED HER.

18:41.954 --> 18:45.040
THAT REMINDS ME,
WHATEVER YOU DO,

18:45.124 --> 18:47.376
DON'T SNAP, CLAP,

18:47.459 --> 18:51.588
OR SAY "I COMMAND YOU
TO AWAKEN!"

18:51.672 --> 18:52.673
[roars]

18:52.756 --> 18:53.924
- [screams]

18:54.007 --> 18:57.469
- DID I SAY THAT OUT LOUD?

18:57.553 --> 18:59.137
WELL, NOW IT'S GONNA
GET INTERESTING.

18:59.221 --> 19:03.225
OKAY,
WHERE'S THAT PAIL?

19:03.308 --> 19:06.812
- YES, CHUM CHUM,
WHERE IS THAT PAIL?

19:06.895 --> 19:10.065
- I'M BACK.

19:10.148 --> 19:12.109
- YOU WENT
TO THE OTHER SIDE?

19:12.192 --> 19:13.902
- I HAD TO GET A PAIL.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.780
- OH, NO,
THIS PAIL IS SO SMALL

19:16.864 --> 19:18.240
IT WON'T EVEN
HOLD ONE SQUIRT!

19:18.323 --> 19:21.243
- BING! I'LL GO
GET US A WADING POOL!

19:21.326 --> 19:24.538
B.R.B!

19:24.621 --> 19:26.331
- UNH! UNH!

19:26.415 --> 19:29.585
I THINK THIS UDDER'S CLOGGED!

19:29.668 --> 19:30.377

19:30.460 --> 19:32.254
- UH, WHAT DO I DO WITH--

19:32.337 --> 19:33.130
AAH!

19:33.213 --> 19:34.214
UNH!
[squishing sounds]

19:34.298 --> 19:35.591
YAA! WAA! UNH!

19:35.674 --> 19:38.093
- SEE ANYTHING?

19:38.176 --> 19:42.764
- I SEE THINGS
THAT CAN'T BE UNSEEN!

19:42.848 --> 19:44.975
- ALOHA!
SORRY I'M LATE.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.602
STILL ON ISLAND TIME.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.269
HEY, WHERE'S CHUM CHUM?

19:47.352 --> 19:48.979
- [grunting, groaning]

19:49.062 --> 19:49.605
AARRGHH!

19:49.688 --> 19:51.899
UNH...

19:51.982 --> 19:54.192
- OH, HEY, BUDDY.
WORKING HARD OR HARDLY WORKING?

19:54.276 --> 19:55.485
[laughs]

19:55.569 --> 19:55.986
UNH!

19:56.069 --> 19:57.905
- [grunts]

19:57.988 --> 19:59.948
THIS ONE'S PUTTING UP
QUITE A FIGHT!

20:00.032 --> 20:00.574
RRAHH! OOH!

20:00.657 --> 20:02.743
UNH!

20:02.826 --> 20:05.746
- YOU KNOW, MAN-ARCTICA,
I BET FANBOY WOULD LOVE

20:05.829 --> 20:07.789
TO SQUEEZE
SOME OF THIS MILK.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.125
- THAT'S FUNNY,
BECAUSE CHUM CHUM'S

20:10.208 --> 20:14.004
ALWAYS SAYING "I SURE WOULD
LOVE TO STAY RIGHT HERE

20:14.087 --> 20:15.964
"AND SPEND HOURS AND HOURS
CHURNING MILK

20:16.048 --> 20:18.216
INTO ICE YAK BUTTER."

20:18.300 --> 20:20.302
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, CHUM CHUM?

20:20.385 --> 20:21.386
[gasps]

20:21.470 --> 20:22.679
[growls]
CHUM CHUM!

20:22.763 --> 20:25.182
UH, MAN-ARCTICA?

20:25.265 --> 20:27.309
I JUST REMEMBERED
I LEFT THE OVEN ON

20:27.392 --> 20:28.268
BACK AT THE IGLOO.

20:28.352 --> 20:29.603
SILLY ME.
[laughs]

20:29.686 --> 20:30.228
I'M JUST GONNA CHECK.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.272
- HURRY BACK SOON!

20:32.356 --> 20:35.192
THE UDDERS ARE STARTING
TO TURN ON ME!

20:35.275 --> 20:35.734
WHOA!
OOOH!

20:35.817 --> 20:37.778
OH! DO--OH!

20:37.861 --> 20:40.489
[tropical music]

20:40.572 --> 20:41.907
- YIPPEE!

20:41.990 --> 20:43.158
HMM?

20:43.241 --> 20:44.368
- OH, NO!

20:44.451 --> 20:45.702

20:45.786 --> 20:47.496
IT'S YOUR TURN
TO MILK THAT THUNDER RUMP!

20:47.579 --> 20:48.372
- NO WAY!

20:48.455 --> 20:50.499
I JUST ORDERED QUESADILLAS!

20:50.582 --> 20:53.168

21:09.768 --> 21:11.228

21:11.311 --> 21:13.313

21:13.397 --> 21:14.481
GAARRGH!

21:14.564 --> 21:17.442
BOYS! WHAT ARE YOU DOING

21:19.152 --> 21:24.157
- UH, WE JUST WANTED TO, UH...

21:24.241 --> 21:25.617
[cries]
WE'RE SO SORRY!

21:25.701 --> 21:28.203
WE JUST JUST WANTED TO SEE
WHAT THE WARM SIDE IS LIKE!

21:28.286 --> 21:30.455
- [cries] YEAH, BECAUSE
WE WERE ON YOUR SIDE

21:30.539 --> 21:32.374
AND WE WERE SO COLD!

21:32.457 --> 21:33.625
- [gasps]

21:33.709 --> 21:35.460
- AND WE ALMOST GOT EATEN
BY THE ARCTIC WOLVES

21:35.544 --> 21:39.631
AND THEN THE ICE YAK
WAS REALLY SMELLY!

21:39.715 --> 21:44.636
- I'M SORRY WE HAVE
SUCH WEAK HUMAN FLESH!

21:44.720 --> 21:46.930
- PLEASE DON'T GET MAD AT US
AND TAKE AWAY

21:47.014 --> 21:50.600
OUR BEST FRIENDS BADGE!

21:50.684 --> 21:52.227
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

21:52.310 --> 21:54.646
I SHOULD GIVE YOU
A BRAVEST FRIENDS BADGE!

21:54.730 --> 21:56.690
both: HUH?

21:56.773 --> 21:58.233
- I KNEW YOU BOYS

21:58.317 --> 22:01.987
BUT I HAD NO IDEA YOU WANTED
TO ROUGH IT LIKE THIS!

22:02.070 --> 22:05.699
I MEAN, TO VENTURE
INTO SUCH A HOSTILE CLIMATE!

22:05.782 --> 22:09.619
IT MUST BE 72 DEGREES
OVER THERE!

22:09.703 --> 22:12.164
- SO YOU'RE NOT MAD AT US?

22:12.247 --> 22:16.835
- BOYS, I HAVE NEVER BEEN
MORE PROUD OF TWO SEAL CUBS

22:16.918 --> 22:19.254
IN MY LIFE!

22:19.337 --> 22:23.133
IN FACT, A LEADER
SHOULD LEAD BY EXAMPLE.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.593
IF YOU CAN DO IT,

22:24.676 --> 22:29.139
SO CAN I!

22:29.222 --> 22:31.141
- MORE TROPICAL FREEZY FREEZE?

22:31.224 --> 22:33.727

22:33.810 --> 22:34.269
- AAGGH!

22:34.352 --> 22:38.440
SHUT THE DOOR!

22:38.523 --> 22:42.611
