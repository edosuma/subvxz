WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.009
Previously on...

00:02.033 --> 00:03.610
Until the adoption
is legally finalized,

00:03.634 --> 00:06.291
the birth mother
can still change her mind,

00:06.315 --> 00:08.985
and she has.
Warrants were issued...

00:09.009 --> 00:11.758
I'm going to fire Tom. If you
just fire him, he'll sue you,

00:11.782 --> 00:13.760
and I'll back him up.
You need cause.

00:13.784 --> 00:16.598
Well, I guess I'll have to find
cause. Decisions were made...

00:16.622 --> 00:18.425
I'm going to do something
so awful,

00:18.449 --> 00:21.168
it is going to rock her world.

00:21.192 --> 00:22.529
Threats were spoken...

00:22.553 --> 00:25.032
So what the hell
are we gonna do?

00:25.056 --> 00:27.334
And plans...

00:27.358 --> 00:29.436
Phenobarbital?

00:29.460 --> 00:32.139
It's time to give your brother
the peace he deserves.

00:32.162 --> 00:33.803
Were put into action.

00:35.706 --> 00:38.185
The most
successful private investigator

00:38.209 --> 00:41.688
in Fairview
was a man named Oliver Weston.

00:41.712 --> 00:45.092
Try though he might,
Oliver couldn't remember

00:45.116 --> 00:48.625
the exact moment
he stopped believing in love.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.198
Was it the night
he caught an executive

00:51.222 --> 00:53.160
cheating with his secretary?

00:55.055 --> 00:57.033
Or was it the day
he saw a housewife

00:57.057 --> 00:59.206
cheating with her delivery boy?

01:01.392 --> 01:04.176
Or was it the time
he caught the girl next door

01:04.200 --> 01:06.543
cheating with the couple
who lived across the street?

01:08.639 --> 01:10.317
Whenever the moment,

01:10.341 --> 01:13.280
Oliver Weston
was now officially a cynic

01:13.304 --> 01:18.155
who only believed in betrayal
and suspicion.

01:18.179 --> 01:21.057
Luckily for Oliver,
that's what paid his bills.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.131
Okay, you forgot fighting.

01:24.155 --> 01:26.193
What are you doing?

01:26.217 --> 01:28.235
Oh. Sorry, man.
Are these your bushes?

01:28.259 --> 01:30.767
I'll clean that
all up when I'm done.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.100
It'll be like I was not here.

01:33.124 --> 01:35.507
You're done now.
Whoa, easy, big fella.

01:35.531 --> 01:37.604
I'm just a p.I. Doing
a domestic surveillance job.

01:37.628 --> 01:39.346
For who?

01:39.370 --> 01:41.178
The blonde lady
at the end of the street.

01:41.202 --> 01:42.779
Edie britt?

01:42.803 --> 01:44.411
Yeah. That's her fiancÃ©.

01:44.435 --> 01:46.813
Apparently, he dumped her
for another woman,

01:46.837 --> 01:49.256
and I just figured out who.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.658
Susan?
There's nothing going on there.

01:51.682 --> 01:54.321
They used to be married.
She's only talking to him

01:54.345 --> 01:57.324
because they have a kid together. From what I
heard, they're on their way to kid number two.

01:57.348 --> 02:00.867
Well, you don't know what you're talking about.
Yeah, and you don't know these soccer moms like I do.

02:00.891 --> 02:02.869
By day, they bake cookies
and carpool.

02:02.893 --> 02:06.277
But dim the lights and bam...
They turn into total pigs.

02:07.598 --> 02:09.235
She's not like that.

02:09.259 --> 02:10.836
Oh, please. Look at her.

02:10.860 --> 02:14.131
That woman clearly knows
her way around a mattress.

02:17.368 --> 02:22.489
Yes, Oliver Weston
had become a cynic,

02:22.513 --> 02:25.121
which is why
he couldn't recognize

02:25.145 --> 02:33.145
a man who was still in love.

02:35.326 --> 02:37.204
Every family has a way of hiding

02:37.228 --> 02:40.237
what it doesn't want seen...

02:40.261 --> 02:42.239
Whether it's with a picture

02:42.263 --> 02:46.313
that covers
a stain on the wall...

02:46.337 --> 02:51.878
Or with a closet door that
conceals the chaos inside...

02:51.902 --> 02:53.880
Or with artificial smiles

02:53.904 --> 02:58.255
that mask
years of pain and heartache,

02:58.279 --> 03:00.227
every family
goes to great lengths

03:00.251 --> 03:02.889
to hide ugly truths.

03:02.913 --> 03:06.663
Some, of course,
go further than others.

03:14.595 --> 03:17.404
So are you
gonna do this tonight?

03:17.428 --> 03:20.207
No, the ice cream
is for tomorrow.

03:20.231 --> 03:24.180
I'm taking Caleb on a picnic
to rockwater lake.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.521
I'm preparing
all of his favorite foods.

03:26.545 --> 03:30.317
So when you're done,
you're just gonna...

03:30.341 --> 03:31.841
Leave him lying there?

03:33.844 --> 03:35.354
No.

03:38.249 --> 03:40.827
I'll call 9-1-1 anonymously,

03:40.851 --> 03:45.572
but I will be watching
from a distance to make sure

03:45.596 --> 03:48.996
that...
That they pick up his body.

03:50.901 --> 03:53.380
You know, mom,
you don't have to do this.

03:53.404 --> 03:55.391
I won't let him
hurt another girl,

03:55.415 --> 03:57.884
and I will not turn him over

03:57.908 --> 04:00.387
to people who will
mock and abuse him.

04:00.411 --> 04:01.771
I just won't.

04:05.676 --> 04:09.326
His last day on this earth

04:09.350 --> 04:11.680
is going to be a perfect one.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.235
Oh, no, thanks, xiao-Mei.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.809
The poor thing.
She was so attached to Lily.

04:22.833 --> 04:24.616
Where'd all this food come from?

04:24.640 --> 04:26.373
The people from Carlos' church.

04:26.397 --> 04:29.976
So you think you and Carlos
will try for another adoption?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.749
I don't think I could go
through that pain again. Hmm.

04:32.773 --> 04:35.256
I did freeze some of my eggs,
so we might

04:35.280 --> 04:37.354
do the surrogacy thing,
but I don't know.

04:37.378 --> 04:40.387
Honey, you've got to eat
something. I don't have an appetite.

04:40.411 --> 04:42.389
In fact,
this is all gonna go to waste.

04:42.413 --> 04:44.970
You guys should take something. No,
no, you should keep it.

04:44.994 --> 04:46.915
I'll take a couple.

04:48.889 --> 04:52.569
What?
Karl dumped me, so I'm alone.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.001
Food fills the void.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.506
Xiao-Mei, I appreciate
your grief, but, really,

04:59.530 --> 05:01.908
you're bringing everybody down.
Will you pull it together?

05:01.932 --> 05:03.702
Mrs. Solis...

05:08.008 --> 05:10.317
I don't understand.
It's from the government.

05:10.341 --> 05:12.689
Let me see.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.326
Gaby, she's being deported.

05:14.350 --> 05:16.323
Xiao-Mei, is this
the first letter like this

05:16.347 --> 05:17.324
you've received?

05:23.354 --> 05:26.803
Oh, my...
This can't be happening.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.075
I can't go home!

05:29.099 --> 05:31.037
My uncle will sell me again.

05:31.061 --> 05:33.580
Oh, no, no, xiao-Mei,
you're not going anywhere.

05:33.604 --> 05:35.817
Hey, you're much too important
to Carlos and me.

05:35.841 --> 05:38.014
We're gonna fight this
and we're gonna win.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.387
Gaby, you can't
promise her that.

05:40.411 --> 05:42.389
Bree, you heard what she said.

05:42.413 --> 05:44.600
I can't let this poor kid
go back to China

05:44.624 --> 05:46.593
and become someone's slave.

05:46.617 --> 05:48.324
Thank you.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.758
All right. Look, my friends
wanna take some of this to go,

05:51.782 --> 05:55.062
so pack it up, and we're
a little low on coffee.

06:01.532 --> 06:03.610
You're actually
gonna let me eat this?

06:03.634 --> 06:05.517
Well, you've been
working so hard,

06:05.541 --> 06:07.714
off on business trips
all the time.

06:07.738 --> 06:10.377
Tonight, we throw caution
and cholesterol to the wind.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.621
You deserve
a little comfort food.

06:14.645 --> 06:17.484
Oh, no, you're pregnant.

06:17.508 --> 06:20.427
God, your mind
goes to dark places.

06:20.451 --> 06:24.661
Honey, you just served me
a plate of full-fat gouda.

06:24.685 --> 06:25.892
What's up?

06:25.916 --> 06:28.535
Okay, well...

06:28.559 --> 06:32.899
Remember I was helping ed
spark up his love life?

06:32.923 --> 06:35.447
Yeah, you sent his wife
those sexy I.M.S. Why?

06:35.471 --> 06:38.475
Well, Fran found out
that ed didn't send them,

06:38.499 --> 06:40.477
and she blew her top.

06:40.501 --> 06:42.909
She wants
the responsible party fired,

06:42.933 --> 06:47.153
and ed lied and told her...

06:47.177 --> 06:48.655
That you sent them.

06:48.679 --> 06:50.717
But... but it wasn't me.
It was you.

06:50.741 --> 06:52.559
I know.

06:52.583 --> 06:54.570
Oh, oh, but ed couldn't
possibly lose you.

06:54.594 --> 06:57.063
No, no, no,
I'm the expendable one.

06:57.087 --> 06:59.466
Look, I know it's ridiculous,

06:59.490 --> 07:01.728
but ed is not a rational person.

07:01.752 --> 07:03.430
Fran has him whipped,

07:03.454 --> 07:06.564
and a whipped husband is someone
we must take very seriously.

07:07.758 --> 07:09.428
Okay.

07:10.861 --> 07:13.179
How do we handle this?

07:13.203 --> 07:14.681
You're under contract.

07:14.705 --> 07:17.544
Ed can't fire you
unless he has just cause.

07:17.568 --> 07:21.087
So until this blows over,
you have to be a model employee.

07:21.111 --> 07:25.091
Show up on time,
no more 3-Martini lunches,

07:25.115 --> 07:27.153
and above all, have ready
all your presentations.

07:27.177 --> 07:29.826
I can't believe
I'm being victimized like this.

07:29.850 --> 07:32.499
Well, honey, in all fairness...

07:32.523 --> 07:35.862
Those are all things
you should be doing anyway.

07:35.886 --> 07:37.156
Fine!

07:46.637 --> 07:50.747
Andrew, I am having Peter
over for dinner tomorrow night,

07:50.771 --> 07:54.551
and I was wondering if you
would like to invite Justin?

07:54.575 --> 07:57.624
Yeah. Um, thanks.
I'll... I'll call him tonight.

07:57.648 --> 07:59.626
Since you two are having
your boyfriends over,

07:59.650 --> 08:02.188
can I invite Matthew?
Out of the question.

08:02.212 --> 08:04.696
So let me get this straight...
You can date a lush,

08:04.720 --> 08:06.693
and he can bring over
his gay lover,

08:06.717 --> 08:08.695
but god forbid
I date a hot black guy.

08:08.719 --> 08:10.196
Until they lock Caleb up,

08:10.220 --> 08:12.499
I don't want you
anywhere near that family.

08:12.523 --> 08:14.506
His brother tried to rape you,

08:14.530 --> 08:17.003
and his mother keeps the guy
locked up in a basement.

08:17.027 --> 08:19.506
I mean, let's face it, Danielle,
even you could do better.

08:19.530 --> 08:21.878
Since when do you take
mom's side over mine?

08:21.902 --> 08:24.050
Your brother and I had a talk,

08:24.074 --> 08:26.653
and we've come
to a dÃ©tente of sorts.

08:26.677 --> 08:29.986
Really? Even after she screwed
you out of your trust fund?

08:30.010 --> 08:32.488
Well, he did falsely accuse me
of child abuse.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.529
I would say we're even.
Wouldn't you, Andrew?

08:34.553 --> 08:36.745
Sure, mom. We're even.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.500
You can stop smiling now.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.578
I know your face is tired. What?

08:46.602 --> 08:48.975
I'm not stupid. I know you
hate her now as much as ever.

08:48.999 --> 08:51.638
Mom and I are
in a good place right now.

08:51.662 --> 08:54.102
Why can't you believe that?

08:55.606 --> 08:58.014
Hi. I got your message.
What's up?

08:58.038 --> 09:01.217
Come on in.

09:01.241 --> 09:02.719
This is Oliver Weston.

09:02.743 --> 09:05.692
He's a p.I. Edie hired.

09:05.716 --> 09:07.954
Edie hired a... p.I.?

09:07.978 --> 09:09.796
Yeah. He's been
spying on you and Karl.

09:09.820 --> 09:11.558
How you doing?

09:11.582 --> 09:13.660
He thinks you two
have been having an affair.

09:13.684 --> 09:15.832
Me and Karl?

09:15.856 --> 09:18.565
Why would you think that?

09:18.589 --> 09:22.809
Come on, suze. You know
we're meant to be together.

09:22.833 --> 09:24.310
Karl, just stop.

09:24.334 --> 09:26.542
Well...

09:26.566 --> 09:30.116
That is Karl being nostalgic.

09:30.140 --> 09:31.648
You said yourself,

09:31.672 --> 09:33.780
the sex last week
was the best you ever had.

09:35.305 --> 09:38.554
Okay, um...

09:38.578 --> 09:41.157
First of all, it wasnot
the best sex I ever had.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.129
I just said that
to make him feel better.

09:43.153 --> 09:45.767
Obviously, you
were the best sex I ever had.

09:45.791 --> 09:47.694
That explains
the punch in the face.

09:47.718 --> 09:49.836
I'm gonna hit you again
if you don't shut up.

09:49.860 --> 09:51.838
I know that this looks bad...

09:51.862 --> 09:54.040
You were actually fooling around
with Karl behind Edie's back.

09:54.064 --> 09:56.047
No, no, no! No, Karl lied to me.

09:56.071 --> 09:58.274
He told me that he and Edie
had split up before...

09:58.298 --> 10:00.647
You know what? I
don't even care. Mike...

10:00.671 --> 10:02.949
- Are we done here?
- Yeah.

10:02.973 --> 10:05.682
Good night, Susan.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.685
Oh...

10:08.709 --> 10:12.118
Hey! Hey, you,
wait, wait, wait. Um...

10:12.142 --> 10:13.960
Okay, you cannot
tell Edie about this.

10:13.984 --> 10:16.628
Whatever she's paying you,
I'll pay you double.

10:16.652 --> 10:19.295
She paid a 2-grand retainer
plus expenses.

10:19.319 --> 10:21.127
$2,000?

10:21.151 --> 10:24.170
Jeez! I gotta
get into real estate.

10:24.194 --> 10:26.903
Okay, I don't have
that kind of cash.

10:26.927 --> 10:30.627
Well, then, I guess
I take the tape to miss britt.

10:31.932 --> 10:35.642
I have a copy!

10:35.666 --> 10:37.106
Ugh!

10:42.743 --> 10:45.291
Okay,
let's try this another way.

10:45.315 --> 10:49.325
You are about to unleash
a nuclear explosion.

10:49.349 --> 10:52.058
Lives are going to be ruined.

10:52.082 --> 10:53.760
I'll tell you what.

10:53.784 --> 10:56.007
I'll hold off till Monday
to report to Ms. Britt.

10:56.031 --> 10:59.005
Yes! That'll give you some
time to scrape together

10:59.029 --> 11:01.708
a little cash. What if I can't?

11:17.878 --> 11:21.087
I'm sorry, but xiao-Mei missed
all of her appeal deadlines.

11:21.111 --> 11:24.738
So that's it? You're just
gonna send her back to China?

11:24.762 --> 11:26.262
My hands are tied.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.365
If your maid were married
to an American citizen,

11:29.389 --> 11:31.938
or had a child
who was an American citizen,

11:31.962 --> 11:34.370
or if she were
a well-known entertainer...

11:34.394 --> 11:35.702
Uh...

11:35.726 --> 11:39.126
What if she was pregnant
withan American citizen?

11:43.333 --> 11:45.381
Uh, xiao-Mei?

11:46.476 --> 11:49.385
We spoke to homeland security,

11:49.409 --> 11:50.887
and we have good news!

11:50.911 --> 11:52.158
I can stay?

11:52.182 --> 11:53.219
Mm-hmm!

11:53.243 --> 11:55.291
Oh! Thank you!

11:55.315 --> 11:56.793
Oh! Okay. Thank you!

11:56.817 --> 12:00.026
Uh... well,
there's just onelittlething...

12:00.050 --> 12:01.697
Um...

12:01.721 --> 12:04.300
The immigration laws have gotten
really tough in this country,

12:04.324 --> 12:06.781
so we're a little
behind the eight ball going in.

12:06.805 --> 12:08.905
But we pled your case,

12:08.929 --> 12:12.909
and we fought tooth and nail,
and the law says you can stay...

12:12.933 --> 12:14.781
But only if you have our baby.

12:15.806 --> 12:17.443
What?

12:17.467 --> 12:19.445
The agent said that
if you were...

12:19.469 --> 12:22.718
Pregnant
with an American citizen,

12:22.742 --> 12:24.120
then they couldn't deport you.

12:24.144 --> 12:27.794
So we thought,
you need a baby in your belly,

12:27.818 --> 12:29.255
we need a surrogate...

12:29.279 --> 12:31.127
Win-win-win.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.831
"Sur-ro-gate"?

12:34.855 --> 12:37.503
Oh, well, it would beourbaby.

12:37.527 --> 12:39.927
It would just
be growing inside of you.

12:41.431 --> 12:42.839
I...

12:42.863 --> 12:45.311
Okay, uh... well...

12:45.335 --> 12:47.143
Uh... oh!
Okay, it's like this...

12:47.167 --> 12:50.446
The three of us are making
your famous szechuan dumplings,

12:50.470 --> 12:53.419
And I'm the dough,

12:53.443 --> 12:56.382
and Carlos is the pork,

12:56.406 --> 12:59.146
and you're the oven.

13:02.452 --> 13:03.930
I have baby?!

13:03.954 --> 13:05.941
Okay,
we take care of everything.

13:05.965 --> 13:07.894
You know, uh, hospital bills

13:07.918 --> 13:10.236
and maternity clothes
and lamaze classes.

13:10.260 --> 13:12.398
And, of course, you wouldn't
have to do any work.

13:12.422 --> 13:15.349
Well, uh, maybe
just a little light dusting.

13:15.373 --> 13:16.525
Nothing major.

13:18.168 --> 13:19.205
No!

13:19.229 --> 13:21.207
No, xiao-Mei,
you don't have a choice.

13:21.231 --> 13:22.949
It's either this
or go back to China.

13:22.973 --> 13:24.180
No to baby!

13:24.204 --> 13:26.544
No!

13:31.141 --> 13:33.820
Had to push the dusting,
didn't you?

13:35.445 --> 13:39.395
Peter, I don't think
I'm being unreasonable here.

13:39.419 --> 13:42.829
It's not like I'm gonna
advertise my addiction history,

13:42.853 --> 13:44.910
but if your kids
ask a direct question,

13:44.934 --> 13:47.403
I'm not gonna lie to them.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.857
Right! Uh-huh. Good point.

13:51.962 --> 13:53.940
Listen,
I don't expect you to lie

13:53.964 --> 13:56.888
about the alcoholism. I mean,
they know that's how we met.

13:56.912 --> 13:58.845
It's just...
You know, the other thing.

13:58.869 --> 14:02.849
Oh! The other thing. They're
just getting to know you,

14:02.873 --> 14:05.857
and so I want them
to focus on your good qualities.

14:05.881 --> 14:07.854
I just don't know
how they'll react

14:07.878 --> 14:09.978
if they find out
that you're a sex addict.

14:13.023 --> 14:14.906
What are you so happy about?

14:14.930 --> 14:16.832
You know how you were mad at mom

14:16.856 --> 14:19.365
about not letting Matthew
come to dinner?

14:19.389 --> 14:20.406
Yeah?

14:20.430 --> 14:22.408
I just figured out
the funniest way

14:22.432 --> 14:25.511
for you to get back at her.

14:25.535 --> 14:28.574
Okay, what's on the schedule
for today?

14:28.598 --> 14:31.217
I have got the Boston toy
presentation ready to go.

14:31.241 --> 14:33.980
Actually, I don't have time
for a full pitch,

14:34.004 --> 14:36.082
so just give me the gist.

14:36.106 --> 14:37.984
Excuse me?

14:38.008 --> 14:41.148
You know, boil it down.
Give me one line.

14:43.283 --> 14:46.432
Okay, basically,
it's "toys are fun."

14:46.456 --> 14:50.396
I hate it. How can you hate
it? I only gave you three words.

14:50.420 --> 14:52.268
It's three words I hate.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.976
Okay, I'm gonna take over
the Boston toy company account.

14:55.000 --> 14:56.943
No, you cannot take over...
In the meantime,

14:56.967 --> 14:59.045
you should all be aware
I don't like the way

14:59.069 --> 15:01.307
you people have been filing
your expense reports.

15:01.331 --> 15:04.150
There's been a lot of padding.

15:04.174 --> 15:07.021
Meanwhile, this company
is hemorrhaging money.

15:07.045 --> 15:09.015
I'm gonna put a stop to it,

15:09.039 --> 15:11.057
so I have hired
a forensic accountant.

15:11.081 --> 15:13.259
He's gonna go through them,
make sure everything's kosher.

15:13.283 --> 15:16.963
And I find one receipt,
one bar tab that's fishy,

15:16.987 --> 15:19.017
it's grounds for dismissal.

15:21.351 --> 15:22.929
Oh, Scavo?

15:22.953 --> 15:26.132
He's gonna start with you.

15:26.156 --> 15:28.134
I can't believe
that son of a bitch

15:28.158 --> 15:29.635
hired a forensic accountant.

15:29.659 --> 15:31.637
He's more whipped
than I thought.

15:31.661 --> 15:33.639
Well, he's tragically
underestimated us.

15:33.663 --> 15:35.641
The gloves are coming off.

15:35.665 --> 15:37.643
You know,
maybe I should just quit.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.645
What? Yesterday
you were up in arms.

15:39.669 --> 15:42.949
Now you're ready to cave? If ed is
determined to get me, sooner or later,

15:42.973 --> 15:45.456
he's gonna get me.
It's just a matter of time.

15:45.480 --> 15:47.253
No, no! We are not backing down.

15:47.277 --> 15:49.255
I'm gonna walk over
to Ed's office right now,

15:49.279 --> 15:51.657
and I'm gonna make very clear
that if you're out the door,

15:51.681 --> 15:54.000
I'm right behind ya.
We can't both be unemployed.

15:54.024 --> 15:56.007
Oh, it'll never happen.
He knows this place

15:56.031 --> 15:59.005
will go down like
a house of cards without me.

15:59.029 --> 16:00.466
Honey, wait. Just wait!

16:00.490 --> 16:02.008
What, what?

16:02.032 --> 16:05.211
I'm not gonna hide
behind my wife's skirt.

16:05.235 --> 16:07.443
We're a team.
I'm just lending support.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.415
That's not the way
it's gonna look

16:09.439 --> 16:11.277
to everybody else out there.

16:11.301 --> 16:14.120
Look, let me talk to him,
man to man.

16:14.144 --> 16:17.583
If my way doesn't work,
then we'll do it your way.

16:17.607 --> 16:21.187
Okay, go get him.

16:33.723 --> 16:35.206
Lynette filled me in

16:35.230 --> 16:37.473
about what happened
with you and Fran and the I.M.,

16:37.497 --> 16:40.497
and I gotta tell ya, this
isn't fair. This isn't right.

16:50.040 --> 16:51.317
Oh, my god!

16:51.341 --> 16:52.588
Oh, my god!

16:52.612 --> 16:55.061
Tom, what happened?

16:55.085 --> 16:57.085
I think I gave him just cause.

16:59.049 --> 17:00.219
Uh...

17:10.599 --> 17:13.679
Susan knew she couldn't afford
to keep the p.I.

17:13.703 --> 17:16.512
From revealing
her affair with Karl,

17:16.536 --> 17:20.086
and since Edie would learn
the truth anyway,

17:20.109 --> 17:24.589
Susan felt it would be better
if it came from her...

17:24.614 --> 17:27.101
Which is how
she came to write a letter

17:27.125 --> 17:29.695
begging Edie for forgiveness.

17:29.719 --> 17:33.359
Her words were so sincere
and heartfelt,

17:33.383 --> 17:36.110
from the moment she mailed it,
Susan knew...

17:38.057 --> 17:41.187
She was a dead woman.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.713
You know, Caleb...

17:47.737 --> 17:50.416
Since the day you were born,

17:50.440 --> 17:54.420
I've always thought of you
as a blessing.

17:54.444 --> 17:57.052
You do know that, right?

17:57.076 --> 18:00.206
I guess.

18:02.712 --> 18:04.660
How come Matty's not here?

18:04.684 --> 18:08.734
Because this isourspecial day,

18:08.758 --> 18:11.497
just you and me.

18:11.521 --> 18:13.799
Is he mad at me?

18:13.823 --> 18:15.341
'Cause of Danielle?

18:15.365 --> 18:19.175
No. He knows that
you didn't mean to scare her.

18:19.199 --> 18:23.349
'Cause he said it was okay
for me to kiss her.

18:23.373 --> 18:25.211
What did you say?

18:25.235 --> 18:27.253
He said Danielle liked me

18:27.277 --> 18:31.217
and that she wouldn't fight me
if I gave her a kiss.

18:31.241 --> 18:32.818
Your brother told you that?

18:32.842 --> 18:36.262
Matty said that
she was waiting for me

18:36.286 --> 18:38.286
and that she wanted
a really big kiss.

18:43.223 --> 18:46.303
What else
did your brother tell you?

18:48.858 --> 18:50.198
Xiao-Mei?

18:52.662 --> 18:54.662
I made you some hot cocoa.

18:56.666 --> 19:00.206
I guess the baby thing didn't
really appeal to you, huh?

19:01.411 --> 19:03.389
I know it's a lot to ask,

19:03.413 --> 19:06.257
it's just, Carlos and I
think of you as family.

19:06.281 --> 19:08.254
Don't you think of us as family?

19:08.278 --> 19:11.197
Oh, yes!

19:11.221 --> 19:14.160
You are like mother to me.

19:14.184 --> 19:16.632
Mm-hmm.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.265
Well,
if we are so friggin' close,

19:19.289 --> 19:20.766
what's the big deal?

19:20.790 --> 19:22.768
It's nine months
out of your life.

19:22.792 --> 19:24.740
I will be ruined.

19:24.764 --> 19:26.904
"Ruined"?

19:29.369 --> 19:30.869
Down there.

19:33.573 --> 19:35.221
Wait.

19:35.245 --> 19:36.545
Are you a virgin?

19:37.707 --> 19:39.485
Wow!

19:39.509 --> 19:43.629
If I have baby,
I will be shamed.

19:43.653 --> 19:45.831
Are you kidding?

19:45.855 --> 19:48.334
No one cares about virginity
in this country.

19:48.358 --> 19:50.336
It went out of style
in the '50s,

19:50.360 --> 19:53.499
and trust me, honey, it ain't
making a comeback.

19:53.523 --> 19:56.542
Seriously, no one cares.

19:56.566 --> 19:58.604
Husband would care.

19:58.628 --> 20:00.846
No man want me if I ruined.

20:00.870 --> 20:04.970
I want husband so much.

20:06.876 --> 20:09.355
Well, what kind of husband
do you want?

20:09.379 --> 20:11.357
Do you want a rich husband?

20:11.381 --> 20:13.219
Well, then,

20:13.243 --> 20:15.226
rich men don't marry virgins
for the same reasons

20:15.250 --> 20:17.693
they don't hire chauffeurs
who can't drive...

20:17.717 --> 20:19.525
They value experience.

20:19.549 --> 20:21.467
Really?

20:21.491 --> 20:25.461
Would I lie to family?

20:29.359 --> 20:31.537
Here are the numbers you wanted.

20:31.561 --> 20:33.909
Lynette, wait.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.587
Have you heard from Tom?
He's not answering his cell phone.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.414
But you don't have
to worry, okay?

20:38.438 --> 20:40.746
You got what you wanted.
He's out of the building.

20:40.770 --> 20:43.349
Come in here and close the door.

20:43.373 --> 20:45.360
You sure?
I might punch you, too.

20:45.384 --> 20:48.254
I'll take my chances.

20:48.278 --> 20:52.798
If this is where you want me
to apologize for my husband,

20:52.822 --> 20:54.360
I'm not gonna do it.

20:54.384 --> 20:56.871
Maybe he shouldn't have hit you,
but you provoked him.

20:56.895 --> 21:00.536
Now wait a minute... no! I'm sorry,
tomgets punished

21:00.560 --> 21:02.908
becauseyoucan't deal
with your screwed-up marriage.

21:02.932 --> 21:04.610
It is pathetic, ed.

21:04.634 --> 21:06.817
If you had stood up
to your wife in the first place,

21:06.841 --> 21:08.814
none of this... what? I love it.

21:08.838 --> 21:11.447
You're giving me crap
about my marriage.

21:11.471 --> 21:13.779
You know what? Here!

21:13.803 --> 21:16.790
Oh, the forensic accountant
found some interesting stuff

21:16.814 --> 21:18.924
in Tom's expense reports.

21:18.948 --> 21:20.926
Yeah, it seems
on his last three trips east,

21:20.950 --> 21:22.928
he cashed in
his first-class ticket

21:22.952 --> 21:26.369
and took a detour to Atlantic
city. What? That can't be right.

21:26.393 --> 21:29.795
Well, it's all there...
Hotels, bar tabs.

21:29.819 --> 21:31.737
Oh, and on this page...

21:31.761 --> 21:33.761
Two tickets to a show.

21:36.396 --> 21:38.026
And flowers.

21:40.730 --> 21:42.748
That doesn't make any sense.

21:42.772 --> 21:45.789
There's gotta be some
kind of an explanation for this.

21:45.813 --> 21:49.615
Before you pass judgment
on someone else's marriage,

21:49.639 --> 21:52.439
I'd clean up my own house first.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.330
Sorry, I don't know

22:04.354 --> 22:06.439
what's taking Danielle so long to get
dressed. Just give her a break, mom.

22:06.463 --> 22:08.604
I'm sure she's just trying
to look nice for our company.

22:08.628 --> 22:10.606
Well, I hope she doesn't get
too dressed up.

22:10.630 --> 22:12.608
I like people to be comfortable.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.462
Oh, I'm comfortable.

22:16.335 --> 22:18.384
Honey, what are you wearing?

22:18.408 --> 22:20.586
You got me this for Christmas.
Don't you remember?

22:20.610 --> 22:23.419
Yes, I just... I'm worried
you might be a little cold.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.800
Oh, I think
it's plenty warm in here.

22:25.824 --> 22:28.394
Don't you, Mr. Mcmillan?

22:28.418 --> 22:30.496
Uh...

22:30.520 --> 22:32.120
Sure.

22:33.583 --> 22:36.367
Well, uh, we should
probably start eating.

22:36.391 --> 22:38.103
We don't want
our frittatas to get cold.

22:38.127 --> 22:41.657
Right. Good. Um, sorry.
Everybody, dig in.

22:45.034 --> 22:46.412
Wow!

22:46.436 --> 22:50.115
Does anybody else think
this salsa's a little too spicy?

22:50.139 --> 22:52.739
I always say,
"the hotter, the better."

22:56.406 --> 23:00.756
So, Mr. Mcmillan, I hear
you went to Perkins college.

23:00.780 --> 23:02.888
I'm thinking about going there
after I graduate.

23:02.912 --> 23:05.831
Uh, Perkins, huh?

23:05.855 --> 23:08.564
I was there.
Yeah, I made it to every party,

23:08.588 --> 23:11.036
and I went to classes
in my spare time.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.609
No, actually, it's a great
college. I think you'd like it.

23:16.633 --> 23:18.103
Isn't this wonderful?

23:18.127 --> 23:21.447
Good food,
pleasant conversation...

23:21.471 --> 23:24.031
This really is
a very special night.

23:25.435 --> 23:27.805
I feel the same way.

23:32.742 --> 23:34.512
So, Peter, is it growing?

23:37.116 --> 23:38.724
What?

23:38.748 --> 23:42.027
Uh, the campus. Has it grown
at all since you've been there?

23:42.051 --> 23:43.821
Uh...

23:45.455 --> 23:47.132
Yeah, it's, uh...

23:47.156 --> 23:50.576
It's grown... Con-considerably.

23:50.600 --> 23:53.639
I would just love
to get my hands on a brochure.

23:53.663 --> 23:57.443
The alumni association

23:57.467 --> 23:59.044
is always sending me stuff,
you know.

23:59.068 --> 24:01.046
I'll... I'll get yousomething!

24:01.070 --> 24:03.540
Oh, my god, are you okay?

24:05.815 --> 24:08.153
I just remembered, you know,
this guy I'm sponsoring...

24:08.177 --> 24:11.156
He said he needed to see me
tonight, so I should go to him.

24:11.180 --> 24:13.629
Well, I guess
that's important, so...

24:13.653 --> 24:16.663
Yeah, so I should go.
No need to show me out.

24:21.931 --> 24:23.609
What a shame.

24:23.633 --> 24:25.620
I really wanted him
to have a chance

24:25.644 --> 24:27.913
to get to know you guys.

24:27.937 --> 24:30.637
Don't worry, I...
I think we made an impression.

24:37.577 --> 24:39.107
Hey. Hey!

24:40.209 --> 24:42.688
I didn't know
if you were coming back.

24:42.712 --> 24:46.091
I waited until
the parking lot cleared.

24:46.115 --> 24:48.233
So, um...

24:48.257 --> 24:49.495
What happened?

24:49.519 --> 24:52.498
You said you were just gonna
go in there and talk to him.

24:52.522 --> 24:53.999
I know, I know.

24:54.023 --> 24:56.010
I know I shouldn't have
hit him.

24:56.034 --> 24:58.225
But... What's done is done.

25:00.530 --> 25:02.077
Anything else going on?

25:02.101 --> 25:03.609
Like what?

25:03.633 --> 25:05.611
I don't know.

25:05.635 --> 25:07.813
Anything you wanna talk about?

25:07.837 --> 25:10.516
'Cause there's nothing
you couldn't tell me.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.818
I would understand.
No, I feel good about this.

25:12.842 --> 25:15.629
It's okay, 'cause I didn't
fit in around here anyway.

25:15.653 --> 25:18.564
I'm gonna get another job
some place else.

25:18.588 --> 25:20.025
Everything's good.

25:20.049 --> 25:21.867
And you, I love.

25:21.891 --> 25:23.591
I love you, too.

25:27.096 --> 25:28.974
You know what's weird?

25:28.998 --> 25:31.707
No, what?

25:31.731 --> 25:34.710
In all the years
we have been married,

25:34.734 --> 25:39.044
I have never seen you lead
with your fists.

25:39.068 --> 25:41.687
Well...

25:41.711 --> 25:45.651
Maybe I still got
some surprises in me.

25:47.176 --> 25:48.846
Maybe you do.

25:54.684 --> 25:56.832
Is it done?

25:56.856 --> 25:58.634
Mm-hmm.

25:58.658 --> 26:00.636
Wow.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.708
We can mourn your brother later.

26:02.732 --> 26:05.649
Right now there are things
that still need to be done.

26:05.673 --> 26:09.314
We need to get rid
of everything...

26:09.338 --> 26:11.838
Mattress, clothes, all of it.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.560
Mom, the... the door's locked.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.364
I know.

26:28.688 --> 26:33.639
Mom, you need
to open this door right now!

26:35.895 --> 26:37.965
Mom!

27:01.691 --> 27:03.829
Honey,
why aren't you dressed yet?

27:03.853 --> 27:05.330
We have to be
at the fertility clinic

27:05.354 --> 27:07.708
in 40 minutes!
Aw, shoot! Is that today?

27:07.732 --> 27:10.035
And, uh, give xiao-Mei
a kick in the pants.

27:10.059 --> 27:12.059
I haven't seen her all morning.

27:15.935 --> 27:17.783
Hey.

27:17.807 --> 27:20.345
Today's the, uh, big day.

27:20.369 --> 27:23.709
You ready to, uh, make a baby?

27:25.644 --> 27:27.154
Ready.

27:39.258 --> 27:41.636
Please...

27:41.660 --> 27:43.060
Be gentle.

27:50.069 --> 27:52.769
Honey, come on.
We're gonna be late.

27:55.945 --> 27:58.754
Hmm, uh...

27:58.778 --> 28:00.055
I think she's confused

28:00.079 --> 28:03.658
as to how we're gonna
make this baby happen.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.822
Oh. And were you planning
on setting her straight?

28:08.958 --> 28:12.118
Next thing out of my mouth.

28:14.263 --> 28:16.676
Come on!
The guy's ready to explode.

28:16.700 --> 28:19.304
I don't care. I'm not
sleeping with mom's boyfriend.

28:19.328 --> 28:21.406
You can't back out now.
You were great the other night.

28:21.430 --> 28:24.409
You got Peter on the hook. He's
primed. I was just messing with his head

28:24.433 --> 28:25.986
to get back at mom. That's all.

28:26.010 --> 28:28.754
Yeah, but why stop there?
She's keeping you from Matthew.

28:28.778 --> 28:30.756
Now, come on, she deserves this.

28:30.780 --> 28:32.858
I'm not that stupid.
Go grind your own ax.

28:32.882 --> 28:35.761
That's him. I
don't have time for this crap.

28:35.785 --> 28:38.785
Now strip down to your bra and panties
now. Get out of my room, you psycho!

28:43.352 --> 28:45.170
Um, my mom won't be back
for a while,

28:45.194 --> 28:47.878
so you probably don't wanna
wait around. Well, that's okay.

28:47.902 --> 28:50.175
I just wanted to make sure
you got the Perkins catalog.

28:50.199 --> 28:53.078
Uh, your mom told me that you're
going on a tour there tomorrow.

28:53.102 --> 28:55.110
Yeah. You're gonna love it.

28:55.134 --> 28:57.818
The campus is beautiful,
the teachers are amazing,

28:57.842 --> 29:00.345
and the student body
is such a great mix.

29:00.369 --> 29:03.088
You know,
they're all about diversity.

29:03.112 --> 29:04.389
Whatever.

29:04.413 --> 29:06.800
All right, well, I'll let
my mom know you stopped by.

29:06.824 --> 29:08.446
Okay.

29:12.051 --> 29:14.729
Andrew...
I also wanted to apologize

29:14.753 --> 29:16.810
for leaving so fast
the other night.

29:16.834 --> 29:18.003
I...

29:18.027 --> 29:20.005
I started to get the feeling

29:20.029 --> 29:22.007
that your sister
was coming on to me,

29:22.031 --> 29:23.809
which was upsetting because...

29:23.833 --> 29:25.440
You're a sex addict?

29:25.464 --> 29:27.913
Your mom told you about that?

29:27.937 --> 29:31.176
Let's just say the word's out.

29:31.200 --> 29:33.148
But, um, I'm curious.

29:33.172 --> 29:36.952
Back in the day, what kind
of stuff were you into?

29:36.976 --> 29:39.154
I don't know that
I wanna talk about that.

29:39.178 --> 29:41.156
Well, I just wanna make sure

29:41.180 --> 29:42.828
you're not into anything
too freaky.

29:42.852 --> 29:44.489
You know, I mean,

29:44.513 --> 29:47.370
you are dating my mom,
and I'm kinda protective of her.

29:47.394 --> 29:48.864
Well, you can relax.

29:48.888 --> 29:51.366
I mean, I wasn't some
sort of pervert, you know.

29:51.390 --> 29:53.869
All I can say is...
I went through a dark period,

29:53.893 --> 29:56.233
and I slept with
a whole lot of people.

29:57.927 --> 29:59.074
People?

29:59.098 --> 30:01.146
What's wrong?

30:01.170 --> 30:05.310
No, it's just that when most
guys discuss their conquests,

30:05.334 --> 30:07.813
they don't say "people."

30:07.837 --> 30:11.186
Oh, well...

30:11.210 --> 30:13.488
No, it's okay.

30:13.512 --> 30:16.822
I appreciate the fact
that you value...

30:16.846 --> 30:18.546
Diversity.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.834
Who is it? Mike.

30:31.530 --> 30:32.938
Susan?

30:32.962 --> 30:34.379
Hi. Sorry.

30:34.403 --> 30:36.386
I'm just on the lookout
for Edie.

30:36.410 --> 30:39.945
Oh, well, you can relax.
Edie won't be coming after you.

30:39.969 --> 30:42.988
Why? I talked to the p.I.,
and he's not gonna tell her anything.

30:43.012 --> 30:45.250
What did you say?

30:45.274 --> 30:48.223
I paid him off, so it's over.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.425
I just thought you should know.

30:50.449 --> 30:52.998
Well, wait.

30:53.022 --> 30:54.399
Why would you do that?

30:54.423 --> 30:57.532
People will just get hurt
if it gets out.

30:57.556 --> 30:59.556
I didn't see the point.

31:14.643 --> 31:17.383
Uh... oh...

31:26.355 --> 31:28.585
Come on, come on, come on.

31:33.963 --> 31:36.871
Hey there. You look thirsty.

31:36.895 --> 31:39.574
This is really nice of you,
Mrs. Mayer.

31:39.598 --> 31:42.647
To be honest with you, I wasn't
even sure that you liked me.

31:42.671 --> 31:44.649
And you know why?
Because we're all so busy

31:44.673 --> 31:48.914
and detached from each other.
You're at my house every day,

31:48.938 --> 31:51.016
and sure,
we wave and we say hello,

31:51.040 --> 31:53.388
but we barely even
know each other.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.196
How long have you
been delivering my mail,

31:56.220 --> 31:58.093
for god's sake?
Three and a half weeks.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.565
Really?

32:00.589 --> 32:02.567
It seems like forever.

32:02.591 --> 32:04.069
Let me top you off.

32:04.093 --> 32:06.476
Oh, no, I couldn't.
This is my third glass. I...

32:06.500 --> 32:08.003
Seriously, I'm sloshin'.

32:09.198 --> 32:11.106
Well, you probably wanna
use the bathroom

32:11.130 --> 32:12.437
before you leave, huh?

32:12.461 --> 32:14.609
No, I'm good. Are you sure?

32:14.633 --> 32:16.586
Uh, I mean,
you have such a long route,

32:16.610 --> 32:18.944
and that ice tea's
gonna go right through ya.

32:18.968 --> 32:23.048
It's better here than
Mrs. McCluskey's hydrangeas.

32:23.072 --> 32:26.691
Well, you know, uh...
Maybe I will use your bathroom.

32:26.715 --> 32:29.024
Great! Oh, the one
down here is broken.

32:29.048 --> 32:31.026
Why don't you use
the one upstairs?

32:31.050 --> 32:32.958
It's right off my bedroom.

32:32.982 --> 32:35.330
Yeah.

32:35.354 --> 32:37.262
Okay.

32:37.286 --> 32:38.986
Got it.

33:06.485 --> 33:08.463
I still can't believe it.

33:08.487 --> 33:09.964
I mean, why would xiao-Mei

33:09.988 --> 33:12.297
just offer herself up to me
like that?

33:12.321 --> 33:14.299
Well, honey, she's a virgin.

33:14.323 --> 33:16.150
Who knows why virgins
do anything?

33:16.174 --> 33:18.973
She's a virgin?

33:18.997 --> 33:20.375
Are you serious?

33:20.399 --> 33:24.029
Yeah. I wouldn't just
slam her for no reason.

33:25.674 --> 33:27.552
Mr. Solis?

33:27.576 --> 33:29.314
It's time to collect your d.N.A.

33:29.338 --> 33:33.088
Oh! Okay, honey,
only good swimmers now.

33:36.745 --> 33:38.223
If you like,

33:38.247 --> 33:41.717
we have a variety of magazines
and videos available.

33:43.192 --> 33:47.202
Mm... I think I'm good.

33:54.103 --> 33:57.543
Gus? Are you okay up there?

34:01.240 --> 34:04.749
Gus!

34:04.773 --> 34:08.092
Uh, do you want me
to keep the hat on?

34:08.117 --> 34:11.356
I know it's a fantasy
for some women.

34:11.380 --> 34:13.197
Uh...

34:16.625 --> 34:17.784
Mom?

34:21.530 --> 34:23.190
Is the mailman here?

34:26.094 --> 34:29.074
That's my daughter. Get dressed!

34:29.098 --> 34:30.514
Mom?

34:30.539 --> 34:34.079
Yes, honey!
Gus the mailman is here!

34:34.103 --> 34:37.530
He's using the bathroom.
He'll be down in a minute.

34:37.554 --> 34:39.583
Oh! Darn it.

34:39.608 --> 34:42.357
Guess we'll have
to take a rain check, huh?

34:42.380 --> 34:44.259
I can come back on Tuesday.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.460
Tu-Tuesday?

34:46.485 --> 34:48.163
No, no, Tuesday's not good,

34:48.187 --> 34:51.235
'cause Tuesday's
the day I, um...

34:51.260 --> 34:52.397
Become a lesbian.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.686
Andrew?

35:11.710 --> 35:14.189
Honey, where are you?
I got your message.

35:14.213 --> 35:17.162
What's the emergency?

35:17.186 --> 35:19.694
Andrew?

35:19.718 --> 35:21.696
Andrew?

35:21.720 --> 35:24.329
Andrew?

35:24.353 --> 35:27.832
Honey, what are you doing
in my bed?

35:27.856 --> 35:30.156
Have you seen my pants?
I can't...

35:35.304 --> 35:39.214
Nowwe're even.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.124
Did you forget
that we're supposed to take

35:50.148 --> 35:52.126
that tour
of Perkins college today?

35:52.150 --> 35:54.659
Seriously?

35:54.683 --> 35:57.267
After last night, I didn't
exactly think you'd be too keen

35:57.291 --> 35:59.734
on sitting next to me
in a car for three hours.

35:59.758 --> 36:02.667
Consider me a cheerleader
for anything that expedites me

36:02.691 --> 36:04.891
getting you out from
under my roof.

36:07.536 --> 36:09.466
Glad we can come
to an understanding.

36:31.189 --> 36:34.269
Why'd we stop here?
We have half a tank left.

36:34.293 --> 36:38.403
There's so many things
I wanna say to you, Andrew.

36:38.427 --> 36:42.577
But mostly, I just want you
to know how sorry I am.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.209
Sorry for what?

36:44.233 --> 36:49.183
Every child deserves
to be loved unconditionally,

36:49.207 --> 36:54.819
and I thought that was the kind
of love that I had for you.

36:54.843 --> 36:57.962
Maybe if I had,
it would've been different.

36:57.986 --> 37:01.226
Why do I
suddenly get the feeling

37:01.250 --> 37:03.950
we're not gonna make it out
to Perkins college today?

37:12.361 --> 37:13.708
What are you doing?

37:13.732 --> 37:15.810
I packed up some of your things.

37:15.834 --> 37:18.548
There's also, um, an envelope
in here with some money,

37:18.572 --> 37:21.586
and that should tide you over
until you get a job.

37:21.610 --> 37:26.251
What, you're gonna leave me out
here in the middle of nowhere?

37:26.275 --> 37:30.375
I noticed a bus stop
about a mile back.

37:32.381 --> 37:34.228
You can go anywhere you want.

37:34.252 --> 37:37.562
Mama, mom, please don't do this.

37:37.586 --> 37:39.726
I have to.

37:41.860 --> 37:45.790
I can't be around you anymore.
I'm just not strong enough.

37:50.299 --> 37:52.847
You know what the good news is?

37:52.871 --> 37:55.249
I win.

37:55.273 --> 37:58.053
You win?

37:59.978 --> 38:03.828
I remember the look in your eyes
when I told you I was gay,

38:03.852 --> 38:08.322
and I knew that one day,
you would stop loving me.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.738
So here we are.

38:13.762 --> 38:15.770
I was right,

38:15.794 --> 38:18.934
and I... I win.

38:21.700 --> 38:23.730
Well, good for you.

39:13.582 --> 39:16.601
Hi. I made you a thank-you pie,

39:16.625 --> 39:19.655
and by "made,"
I mean "bought."

39:59.828 --> 40:03.448
So what exactly
are you thanking me for?

40:03.472 --> 40:06.102
For keeping Edie
from smashing my face in.

40:08.106 --> 40:10.384
That's the nicest thing
anybody ever did for me.

40:10.408 --> 40:13.387
Just... trying
to keep peace on the Lane.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.621
Well, you keep
telling yourself that.

40:16.645 --> 40:18.945
I know why
you really paid that guy off.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.767
You still care about me.

40:22.791 --> 40:24.551
What?

40:26.455 --> 40:28.703
You're always worried
about Julie and me,

40:28.727 --> 40:31.906
and you beat up
my new boyfriend.

40:32.961 --> 40:35.940
And now you're
protecting me from Edie.

40:35.964 --> 40:38.943
Do you know what all that means?

40:38.967 --> 40:41.746
That you're high maintenance?

40:44.813 --> 40:48.623
All right,
you go ahead and be coy. Fine.

40:48.647 --> 40:50.617
I'll be the one
to break the ice.

40:52.120 --> 40:55.050
I've never stopped
caring about you.

40:57.125 --> 40:59.704
Is that why
you jumped in bed with Karl?

40:59.728 --> 41:01.766
I would've never even gone there

41:01.790 --> 41:05.069
if I had thought
there was a chance with us.

41:05.093 --> 41:08.073
You just closed the door
so completely, I...

41:09.868 --> 41:12.598
Ugh, can we just not
talk about him?

41:14.072 --> 41:15.880
Have some more pie.

41:15.904 --> 41:17.914
I know you like pie.

41:20.509 --> 41:22.509
I know you like me.

41:25.183 --> 41:28.563
Listen...

41:28.587 --> 41:31.836
I'm not asking
for us to get back together.

41:31.860 --> 41:34.068
I just want us to be friends.

41:34.092 --> 41:36.641
Susan?

41:36.665 --> 41:38.543
Yes?

41:38.567 --> 41:41.045
Your house is on fire.

41:46.975 --> 41:49.253
My whole house is... on fire!

41:49.277 --> 41:53.788
When the truth is ugly,
people try to keep it hidden,

41:53.812 --> 41:56.521
because they know if revealed,

41:56.545 --> 41:59.824
the damage it will do.

41:59.848 --> 42:03.288
So they conceal it
within sturdy walls...

42:04.553 --> 42:07.863
Or they place it
behind closed doors...

42:09.527 --> 42:14.178
Or they obscure it
with clever disguises...

42:14.202 --> 42:18.613
But truth, no matter how ugly,
always emerges...

42:25.113 --> 42:27.091
And someone we care about

42:27.115 --> 42:30.024
always ends up getting hurt...

42:36.725 --> 42:40.835
And someone else
will revel in their pain,

42:40.859 --> 42:43.859
and that's the ugliest truth
of all.
