00:01.068 --> 00:02.818
<i> Previously on</i> Scorpion...

00:02.819 --> 00:04.569
Meet my new trainee,
Tim Armstrong.

00:04.572 --> 00:05.571
Hello.

00:05.573 --> 00:08.173
There's nothing
more stunning than

00:08.175 --> 00:11.010
seeing perfection
with a slight imperfection.

00:11.012 --> 00:12.411
You're a lawyer.
Yes.

00:12.413 --> 00:13.545
It's my card.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.014
"Heywood Jahelpme."

00:15.016 --> 00:16.682
That's a unique middle name.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.050
Um, actually it's pronounced

00:18.052 --> 00:19.184
"Ja-help-me," as in,

00:19.186 --> 00:21.553
"Hey, would ya help me?"

00:21.555 --> 00:23.255
Oh!
Okay, oh, yeah.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.690
I'm sorry.

00:24.692 --> 00:27.092
Not good at first dates.

00:27.094 --> 00:29.661
It was not the worst date
that I've ever had.

00:32.299 --> 00:35.067
(chuckles)

00:35.069 --> 00:36.101
All right, hey, um...

00:36.103 --> 00:37.102
do you want
to come through?

00:37.104 --> 00:38.137
Okay, sorry.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.438
Excuse me.
Here, yeah, sorry.

00:39.440 --> 00:40.572
Here's a good vantage point.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.241
Oh, so excited.

00:42.243 --> 00:45.310
Went to a movie opening once,
never a flower opening.

00:45.312 --> 00:47.146
Oh, not just any flower,

00:47.148 --> 00:49.081
the titan arum.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.783
Never even heard
of this plant.

00:50.785 --> 00:52.518
(sighs)

00:52.519 --> 00:54.252
It's one of a million
incredible things

00:54.255 --> 00:56.388
that I have learned
these past weeks

00:56.390 --> 00:59.124
just from spending time
with you.

01:07.802 --> 01:09.701
I'm really happy, Walter.

01:09.703 --> 01:12.171
I am as well.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.307
ANNOUNCER:
Botanical Gardens patrons,

01:15.309 --> 01:17.076
the titan arum will be
blooming for the first time

01:17.078 --> 01:18.310
in a decade in just a moment.

01:18.312 --> 01:19.845
Photography is prohibited.

01:21.649 --> 01:22.648
You want one?

01:22.650 --> 01:23.849
No, thank you, I'm full

01:23.851 --> 01:25.350
of fermented fish from dinner.

01:25.352 --> 01:28.220
Oh, huh, me too.

01:28.222 --> 01:29.721
I'm really getting
a taste for it.

01:32.793 --> 01:35.594
Do you know the Indonesians
call it<i> bunga bangkai?</i>

01:35.596 --> 01:37.863
So,<i> bunga</i> means flower
and<i> bangkai</i> means

01:37.865 --> 01:39.231
cadaver.

01:39.233 --> 01:41.133
Why do they name it that?

01:41.135 --> 01:43.102
Well, 'cause that's what
it smells like when it opens.

01:43.104 --> 01:44.336
Oh, it's blooming.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.176
(crowd chattering)

01:57.418 --> 01:59.151
(inhales)
Oh, God...

01:59.153 --> 02:01.520
I know, isn't it
truly amazing?

02:01.522 --> 02:02.788
(people groaning)

02:04.725 --> 02:05.824
Oh.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.626
Linda?

02:07.628 --> 02:09.761
TOBY:<i> You took her to see</i>
<i> the corpse flower?</i>

02:09.763 --> 02:11.163
She loved it...

02:11.164 --> 02:12.564
like she loved the carbon
dating lecture series,

02:12.566 --> 02:14.466
the Griffith Observatory
exhibit...

02:14.468 --> 02:16.335
Oh! And the Combustion
Motors Pavilion

02:16.337 --> 02:17.536
at the Science Center.

02:17.537 --> 02:18.736
Those aren't dates;
those are field trips.

02:18.739 --> 02:20.189
Look, pal,

02:20.190 --> 02:21.640
I've been suspicious
of something for a while now,

02:21.642 --> 02:22.708
and your date confirms my fear.

02:25.513 --> 02:26.778
Linda ain't into you.

02:26.780 --> 02:27.880
Wrong.

02:27.882 --> 02:30.182
She's very much EQ for my IQ,

02:30.184 --> 02:31.183
if you know what I'm saying.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.484
I do, and gross...

02:32.486 --> 02:33.852
but the fact is

02:33.854 --> 02:35.337
she suffers
from Damsel Syndrome.

02:35.338 --> 02:36.821
'Cause you risked
your life to save her,

02:36.824 --> 02:37.823
so when she's with you

02:37.825 --> 02:38.924
she experiences the same

02:38.926 --> 02:41.160
dopamine and endorphin release

02:41.162 --> 02:42.761
she had during
that intense experience.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.297
S-s-she's hooked
on that physiological reaction.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.467
It's one that will
eventually fade.

02:48.469 --> 02:51.737
Well, she's the first non-genius
woman who actually likes

02:51.739 --> 02:53.539
the things that I like;
she enjoys being with me...

02:53.541 --> 02:54.873
She-she enjoys the chemical
reaction in her brain.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.209
I-I-I take no pleasure

02:57.211 --> 02:58.210
in telling you this, pal.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.795
Look...

02:59.796 --> 03:01.379
Paige has been spending
some time with Tim lately.

03:01.382 --> 03:03.132
Uh-huh.
Your subconscious

03:03.133 --> 03:04.883
sees this and wants you
to find your own companion.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.885
It's blinding you to the truth.

03:06.887 --> 03:07.886
Hey.

03:07.888 --> 03:08.854
Good, you guys are here.

03:08.856 --> 03:09.855
Hey.

03:09.857 --> 03:11.623
Oh, Cabe doesn't like it

03:11.625 --> 03:12.858
when people use
his travel mugs.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.493
Oh, no, Tim-Tim
gave it to me.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.428
Okay, should we go in?

03:18.332 --> 03:19.331
Are you okay?

03:19.333 --> 03:20.599
You look sick.

03:20.601 --> 03:21.800
What, no, I'm just...

03:21.802 --> 03:23.402
uh, anxious about Ralph.

03:23.404 --> 03:24.803
Oh, okay.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.939
I insisted Ralph
work only on my laptop

03:26.941 --> 03:28.640
in class because
I doubted that

03:28.642 --> 03:29.875
a child could
do all the work

03:29.877 --> 03:31.443
on his own
without any help.

03:31.445 --> 03:33.645
I wanted to
observe him closely.

03:33.647 --> 03:34.880
My concerns were founded.

03:34.882 --> 03:36.548
He failed the assignment.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.450
I'm gonna knock this guy out.

03:38.452 --> 03:41.553
So,<i> you</i> had him use
<i> your</i> computer,

03:41.555 --> 03:43.555
so there's no real way to prove

03:43.557 --> 03:45.457
that Ralph created
the code in question?!

03:45.459 --> 03:47.826
Yes, that's my point.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.294
No, no, no, wait, uh...

03:49.296 --> 03:50.362
I meant...

03:50.364 --> 03:52.081
his, um...

03:52.082 --> 03:53.799
he's turning...
Your Honor, can I start over?

03:53.801 --> 03:55.701
I hope he's working
on contingency.

03:55.703 --> 03:57.269
JUDGE: Mr. Morris,

03:57.270 --> 03:58.836
do you have any more
questions at this time?

03:58.839 --> 04:00.005
I'm not sure.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.307
This is not going how I'd hoped.

04:03.377 --> 04:05.010
Request for re-direct,
Your Honor?

04:05.012 --> 04:05.844
Go ahead.

04:06.914 --> 04:09.248
This is harder than it is on TV.

04:11.018 --> 04:14.486
Professor, can you tell us
what these are?

04:15.456 --> 04:16.989
Coding's like writing a novel.

04:16.991 --> 04:19.891
Don't want to lose chapters
to a computer glitch,

04:19.893 --> 04:21.293
so I back up my work.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.028
The printout proves
I've been scripting

04:23.030 --> 04:24.329
that code for six months.

04:24.331 --> 04:26.298
I didn't just
recently steal it.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.933
Ralph's code was just
a rudimentary project.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.868
He just messed up.

04:29.870 --> 04:30.902
If I can get those records,

04:30.904 --> 04:31.903
I can beat this guy.

04:31.905 --> 04:32.904
JUDGE:
I've seen enough.

04:32.906 --> 04:33.905
I'm ready to rule.

04:33.907 --> 04:35.424
You have to stop him, Heywood.

04:35.425 --> 04:36.942
But he's picking up the hammer.
Think of something.

04:36.944 --> 04:41.013
Your Honor, uh, we've not seen
the back up documents ever.

04:41.015 --> 04:43.415
That's because you
never requested them.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.751
You only asked
for a copy of the code,

04:45.753 --> 04:47.586
not the work product
that went into making the code.

04:47.588 --> 04:48.587
Yes...

04:48.589 --> 04:51.056
but that's because I forgot.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.908
Your Honor,

04:52.909 --> 04:54.759
you can't rule at this
moment because, uh...

04:54.762 --> 04:55.827
(clears throat)

04:56.697 --> 04:57.896
Mm, uh...

04:58.799 --> 05:00.332
My client has

05:00.334 --> 05:01.733
major mental issues.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.402
Talk about projection.

05:03.404 --> 05:04.770
Make your point, Mr. Morris.

05:04.772 --> 05:08.040
As stated in the affidavits,
my client is a genius,

05:08.042 --> 05:10.876
and high intelligence
can be a detriment,

05:10.878 --> 05:15.013
and you allowed a minor
with unique challenges

05:15.015 --> 05:17.683
to testify before we could
give him a competency hearing.

05:17.685 --> 05:20.585
You're challenging the
competency of your own client?

05:20.587 --> 05:22.421
You're just trying to buy time.

05:22.423 --> 05:24.323
Your Honor, if you rule now,

05:24.325 --> 05:25.891
you leave your decision
open for appeal...

05:25.893 --> 05:29.061
or, you could let me
have him evaluated.

05:29.063 --> 05:31.496
Fine, you have until 2:00 p.m.

05:31.498 --> 05:34.032
(gavel bangs)
All right.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.834
Won a motion.

05:39.673 --> 05:40.972
Tell me again what
you're looking for

05:40.974 --> 05:42.708
in these boxes of paperwork.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.443
Sometimes I'd leave
numerical clues in my code

05:44.445 --> 05:45.777
to remember where
I had to go back

05:45.779 --> 05:46.878
to clean things up.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.447
It's called bookmarking.

05:48.449 --> 05:49.715
It's called, "I'm lost."
(laughs)

05:49.717 --> 05:51.416
I'm gonna go

05:51.418 --> 05:52.718
read case files,
see if I can

05:52.720 --> 05:54.052
find anything
to help us.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.088
Anybody know if there's
a law library in town?

05:58.058 --> 06:00.058
I'll find it.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.927
Yeah, uh, I'm lost, too.

06:01.929 --> 06:04.296
How does bookmarking help?

06:04.297 --> 06:06.664
I used numbers easy for me
to spot, like my birthday.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.767
So if I find them,
I can prove I did the work.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.102
You're a genius;
don't you remember

06:10.104 --> 06:11.759
where you left them?

06:11.760 --> 06:13.415
There's 25 million
lines of code.

06:13.416 --> 06:15.071
Could've memorized
the locations if I wanted to,

06:15.075 --> 06:16.875
but I didn't think it
was relevant at the time.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.844
Okay, I'm gonna grab
the others and we'll start

06:18.846 --> 06:19.945
searching where you scripted

06:19.947 --> 06:21.079
the sine curves
of the sound waves.

06:21.081 --> 06:23.148
No, I used
counter-propagating

06:23.150 --> 06:24.533
surface acoustic waves;

06:24.534 --> 06:25.917
sent them across
the piezoelectric substrate.

06:25.919 --> 06:27.519
Wait, how-how does that work?

06:27.521 --> 06:28.520
So, I can
change data flow

06:28.522 --> 06:30.155
by changing sound pitch.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.456
I'm not sure how
that would play out.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.525
It's simple data transfer.

06:33.527 --> 06:35.527
Right, on-on the crest
or the trough of the wave?

06:35.529 --> 06:36.995
(sighs)
You're right.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.630
You should work
on the sine curves.

06:38.632 --> 06:39.931
Ralph, I don't need you

06:39.933 --> 06:41.666
to tell me
what to work on.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.101
Okay? We'll focus

06:43.103 --> 06:44.469
on the acoustic waves.

06:44.471 --> 06:46.004
Now we don't have much time,

06:46.006 --> 06:47.706
so let's just get to it.

06:50.411 --> 06:51.743
What the hell is wrong with you?

06:51.745 --> 06:53.645
You snapped at him.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.547
I didn't snap.
No, he was overexplaining

06:55.549 --> 06:56.782
and we're on a clock.

06:56.783 --> 06:58.016
He was helping you
with something that you

06:58.018 --> 06:59.851
clearly didn't understand,
and you barked at him.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.186
I did not.
He doesn't even...

07:01.188 --> 07:02.454
Feel things?

07:02.456 --> 07:03.806
Yes, he does, Walter.

07:03.807 --> 07:05.157
He is like you,
but not exactly like you.

07:05.159 --> 07:06.858
You owe him an apology,
and the next time you talk

07:06.860 --> 07:08.160
to him like that,
I am out of here.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.097
Hey, Walt.

07:12.099 --> 07:13.732
Hmm?

07:13.734 --> 07:15.033
Who peed in your punch?

07:15.035 --> 07:16.535
What?

07:16.537 --> 07:17.769
Nobody.

07:17.771 --> 07:18.904
Then gather up the gang.

07:18.906 --> 07:20.172
Tim's coming in

07:20.174 --> 07:21.640
with Agent Cook
from the Department of Defense.

07:21.642 --> 07:22.641
He has top clearance

07:22.643 --> 07:24.576
and these guys
don't mess around.

07:24.578 --> 07:27.646
Fort Knox is a U.S. Army base.

07:27.648 --> 07:30.482
The famous gold depository
located there

07:30.484 --> 07:31.983
is controlled completely
by the Treasury.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.552
They also have authority over

07:33.554 --> 07:35.554
not only
our nation's gold supply,

07:35.556 --> 07:37.656
but artifacts
from our history such as

07:37.658 --> 07:39.658
the Bill of Rights and
Declaration of Independence.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.210
Those are displayed

07:41.211 --> 07:42.761
in the National Archive
Museum in D.C.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.896
Documents that look like them
are displayed in D.C.

07:44.898 --> 07:46.097
The real McCoys

07:46.099 --> 07:47.933
need to be protected.

07:47.935 --> 07:49.835
Knox also houses
historic valuables

07:49.837 --> 07:51.670
belonging to foreign
governments for safekeeping

07:51.672 --> 07:53.939
because the facility is,
without question,

07:53.941 --> 07:55.207
the most secure on earth.

07:55.209 --> 07:56.208
I'm sensing

07:56.210 --> 07:57.709
a big "but" coming.

07:57.711 --> 07:58.877
(laughs) Big butt.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.180
Well, recently,

08:02.182 --> 08:05.050
the Treasury privatized
Depository security

08:05.052 --> 08:07.652
by hiring Steelson Security,

08:07.654 --> 08:09.855
it's a Blackwater-like firm.

08:09.857 --> 08:11.089
The DOD feels this compromises

08:11.091 --> 08:13.792
our nation's treasures
and reserves.

08:13.794 --> 08:16.194
We feel we should protect
the Depository

08:16.196 --> 08:18.730
and we want to prove it
to the president.

08:18.732 --> 08:19.798
Okay...

08:19.800 --> 08:21.466
provide aerial
photos of the base,

08:21.467 --> 08:23.133
breakdown of the private
security company's operational

08:23.136 --> 08:24.936
logistic, we'll analyze...

08:24.938 --> 08:26.204
No, I can't use theories.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.606
I need proof...

08:27.608 --> 08:28.807
and the only way to prove

08:28.809 --> 08:30.609
Fort Knox isn't secure...

08:30.611 --> 08:31.676
is to break in.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.211
BOTH:
Crazy-man-says-what-now?

08:33.213 --> 08:34.880
The White House
doesn't want to order

08:34.882 --> 08:37.115
a security change
without hard evidence

08:37.117 --> 08:38.517
of vulnerability.

08:38.519 --> 08:39.618
Because if they do,

08:39.619 --> 08:40.718
and Knox is cracked
at a later date,

08:40.721 --> 08:42.754
the administration
has egg on its face.

08:42.756 --> 08:44.256
Exactly.

08:44.258 --> 08:45.957
Proof of successful breach

08:45.959 --> 08:49.261
<i> will be the removal of</i>
<i>a 300-year-old Prussian scepter</i>

08:49.263 --> 08:51.730
held by the U.S. due
to an ownership dispute

08:51.732 --> 08:53.231
between Germany and Poland.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.050
One of a kind,

08:55.051 --> 08:56.868
covered in flawless diamonds,
and can't be forged.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.838
You retrieve it,
we know we have to change

08:59.840 --> 09:01.039
the way our assets
are protected.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.908
But no one can know
that we're coming in

09:02.910 --> 09:04.609
or the endeavor
is inherently flawed.

09:04.611 --> 09:06.044
Which means real guards...

09:06.046 --> 09:07.045
With real guns...

09:07.047 --> 09:08.780
Will try to stop us.
Yes...

09:08.782 --> 09:10.916
and the job is completely
off the books,

09:10.918 --> 09:13.718
which means if you're caught,
the DOD and the White House

09:13.720 --> 09:15.687
will deny any knowledge
of this mission...

09:15.689 --> 09:17.622
and even if you
get past the guards,

09:17.624 --> 09:19.224
all the way to
the subterranean vault,

09:19.226 --> 09:21.760
it's rigged to
expel knockout gas

09:21.762 --> 09:23.428
at the first sign
of tampering,

09:23.429 --> 09:25.095
and who knows what traps
lay beyond that door.

09:25.098 --> 09:26.898
Yeah, I've seen
this movie before.

09:26.900 --> 09:29.634
Hey, Stallone, go see if
that prison is secure.

09:29.636 --> 09:30.802
What?
You're trapped now?

09:30.804 --> 09:32.270
That's a bummer.

09:32.271 --> 09:33.737
Sorry, pal, off the books
is off the table.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.575
All right but
off the books means

09:36.577 --> 09:38.176
off the ledger,

09:38.178 --> 09:40.045
as in tax-free.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.581
(scoffs)

09:42.583 --> 09:44.683
All right.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.888
$1 million cash.

09:49.890 --> 09:53.191
Compliments of your president
and a grateful nation.

09:53.193 --> 09:54.726
Do you mind if I smell that?

09:54.728 --> 09:55.727
WALTER:
You know what,

09:55.729 --> 09:56.828
i-it is very tempting,

09:56.830 --> 09:59.831
but there are
too many variables...

09:59.833 --> 10:01.099
and we're not lab rats.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.366
Put us in a cage and see
if the trap springs?

10:02.369 --> 10:03.368
No, thank you.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.370
Yeah, Walter's right.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.872
These guys, they don't
do<i> Mission: Impossible.</i>

10:07.874 --> 10:09.941
I mean, the mechanical
obstacles they would face

10:09.943 --> 10:11.743
in the vault alone
are too daunting.

10:11.745 --> 10:12.777
HAPPY:
Easy...

10:12.779 --> 10:13.845
Prom King.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.180
I can figure out any safe.
Doubtful.

10:15.182 --> 10:17.182
Plus, we're talking
about highly-trained

10:17.184 --> 10:18.216
private mercenaries.

10:18.218 --> 10:19.918
They don't just
get outsmarted.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.920
I have yet to meet a person
that I can't read

10:21.922 --> 10:23.655
or outsmart.

10:23.657 --> 10:25.023
You got a little coffee stain

10:25.025 --> 10:26.658
on your shirt.
Oh, see?

10:26.660 --> 10:29.444
Outsmarted.

10:29.445 --> 10:32.229
Okay, but Fort Knox
is run by state-of-the-art

10:32.232 --> 10:33.398
software that
can't be cracked.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.399
WALTER: Thank you.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.400
Appreciate the insight,

10:35.402 --> 10:36.868
Tim, but, uh...

10:36.869 --> 10:38.335
we can handle
the physical structure,

10:38.338 --> 10:39.904
the guards, the software

10:39.906 --> 10:41.640
and anything else
that's thrown at us...

10:41.642 --> 10:42.674
oh, but...

10:42.676 --> 10:44.660
Ralph needs our help.

10:44.661 --> 10:46.645
I can help him, and I can
provide support from the garage.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.213
I'll be with Ralph
for the hearing.

10:48.215 --> 10:49.314
This could work.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.315
You okay with this?

10:50.317 --> 10:52.217
I don't like backing down

10:52.219 --> 10:54.119
on something just
'cause it's difficult.

10:54.121 --> 10:55.520
I don't like backing down from

10:55.521 --> 10:56.920
a million dollars.
Think about this, Walt.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.724
I thought I was the one

10:59.726 --> 11:00.825
who manipulated their egos.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.727
Knox is an integral
national interest,

11:02.729 --> 11:05.730
and Homeland needs
Scorpion to take this case...

11:07.067 --> 11:09.367
...and I may have
picked up a few things

11:09.369 --> 11:11.202
on how to handle these guys
from watching you.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.271
Learn from
the best, right?

11:16.376 --> 11:18.977
All right,
let's break into Fort Knox.

11:18.979 --> 11:21.212
I'd say we could
hack the security,

11:21.214 --> 11:22.814
but I assume Knox is air-gapped.

11:22.816 --> 11:23.882
Yes.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.183
System's completely
off-line.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.085
Great, so that means
there's no information

11:27.087 --> 11:29.387
transmitted into
or out of the Depository.

11:29.389 --> 11:32.057
But you know what is transferred
in and off the base: water.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.092
There are pipes
bringing water in and out.

11:34.094 --> 11:35.927
Standard plumbing pipes
aren't big enough

11:35.929 --> 11:38.063
for humans to fit through.

11:38.064 --> 11:40.198
No duh, but they are
small enough to easily clog.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.401
<i> I can modify a toy submarine</i>
<i> with a GPS tracker.</i>

11:43.403 --> 11:44.936
<i> Drop it into</i>
<i> the municipal system.</i>

11:44.938 --> 11:46.438
<i> Sly controls it</i>
<i> from the garage.</i>

11:46.440 --> 11:48.373
SYLVESTER:<i> Knox's blueprints</i>
<i> are top secret,</i>

11:48.375 --> 11:50.775
<i> but the municipal water</i>
<i> schematics are easily hacked.</i>

11:50.777 --> 11:53.445
<i> I can guide the sub</i>
<i> underneath the Depository.</i>

11:53.447 --> 11:56.014
Toy's not big enough
to cause a clog.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.982
It is if it's carrying
the right cargo.

11:57.984 --> 12:00.085
Happy, what're you thinking?
Polyurethane foam.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.904
<i> Sly pops open the hatch,</i>

12:01.905 --> 12:03.722
<i> when polyurethane reacts</i>
<i> with water it expands,</i>

12:03.724 --> 12:05.423
<i> causing a heck</i>
<i> of a spill upstairs.</i>

12:05.425 --> 12:07.992
<i> They'll report the problem</i>
<i> to Base Maintenance.</i>

12:07.994 --> 12:09.461
(line ringing)
<i> We hack their phone system so</i>

12:09.463 --> 12:11.429
<i> all calls come to us. </i>
Maintenance.

12:11.431 --> 12:12.831
Sure thing, I'll send

12:12.833 --> 12:14.099
a plumbing crew up
to you right away.

12:14.101 --> 12:16.067
Okay, so they
pretend to be plumbers

12:16.069 --> 12:17.268
but how do they get on the base?

12:17.270 --> 12:18.803
Tim and I can help
out with that.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.438
We set up a meeting

12:20.440 --> 12:22.107
with the base commander
through Homeland

12:22.109 --> 12:24.175
<i> under the guise of</i>
<i> discussing theoretical threats</i>

12:24.177 --> 12:26.878
<i> against national institutions</i>
<i> like Knox.</i>

12:26.880 --> 12:29.047
We're here to see
Colonel Fontenot.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.317
HAPPY:
<i>We exit the trunk in character.</i>

12:32.319 --> 12:35.019
<i> Army plumbers ready</i>
<i> to lend a hand.</i>

12:35.021 --> 12:36.855
MAN:
Thanks for getting here so fast.

12:36.857 --> 12:37.922
It's a real mess in there.

12:37.924 --> 12:39.074
No worries.

12:39.075 --> 12:40.225
We deal with a lot
of messy situations.

12:42.028 --> 12:45.063
Once in the Depository,
you get the scepter and meet me

12:45.065 --> 12:47.065
at a rendezvous point
in the woods on the base.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.833
DOD runs Army bases

12:48.835 --> 12:50.368
so I can get on the grounds
as a matter of course.

12:50.370 --> 12:52.070
But how do they get
into the vault?

12:52.072 --> 12:54.939
Simple, we use their own
security system against them.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.307
You know, I'm not telling
you how to do your job

12:56.309 --> 12:57.942
but those don't look
like water pipes.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.944
They look like conduit.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.945
If you look at the spigot hole
there's condensation.

13:03.316 --> 13:05.116
TOBY:
Hmm, look at that?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.985
Maybe they do have
knockout gas in this place.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.386
Happy, hit it.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.487
HAPPY:
<i> Then I re-route</i>

13:09.489 --> 13:10.822
<i> the gas that was meant</i>

13:10.824 --> 13:12.157
<i> for the vault door</i>
<i> so it disperses</i>

13:12.159 --> 13:14.559
<i> through the vent system.</i>

13:14.561 --> 13:16.494
TOBY:<i> Knockout gas</i>
<i> gives us 30 minutes</i>

13:16.496 --> 13:17.996
<i> to get into the vault,</i>
<i> crack it,</i>

13:17.998 --> 13:19.798
<i> grab the scepter and exit.</i>

13:19.800 --> 13:22.000
CABE:<i> Tim and I finish up</i>
<i> our chat with the Colonel,</i>

13:22.002 --> 13:24.269
<i> wait for you by the car.</i>

13:24.271 --> 13:26.237
Well, we've taken up enough
of your time, Colonel.

13:26.239 --> 13:28.940
Just know that Homeland's here
to help you any way we can.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.108
Well, I've got
the base covered,

13:30.110 --> 13:32.010
don't know much
about the Depository

13:32.012 --> 13:34.012
since Steelson took over.

13:34.013 --> 13:36.013
Only change is they put
a fully armed and equipped guard

13:36.016 --> 13:37.315
down at the vault entrance

13:37.317 --> 13:40.151
instead of just at the
elevators leading to it.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.853
You don't say.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.254
Walter,
did you copy that?

13:43.256 --> 13:45.423
There's more than gas
guarding the basement vault.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.025
There's a guard, Walter!

13:47.027 --> 13:50.195
Yes, we are aware.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.232
Not good.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.442
All of you, up against the wall!

14:04.443 --> 14:05.442
Would you believe
that we're the plumbers

14:05.443 --> 14:06.442
who've come to fix the sink?

14:08.481 --> 14:09.981
(grunts)
I guess not.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.049
I think he just hit Toby.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.050
Don't wise-mouth the guy.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.051
Do what he says.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.052
(groans)

14:14.054 --> 14:15.153
Against the wall now!

14:15.155 --> 14:16.521
Okay, okay.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.092
GUARD:
This is Pike.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.126
Anyone awake up there?

14:26.433 --> 14:27.498
Anyone copy?

14:27.500 --> 14:29.033
Repeat, do you copy?

14:30.604 --> 14:31.636
Nice try.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.171
My mask has night vision.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.006
That's what we're
counting on, flashlights.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.877
(grunting)

14:39.946 --> 14:40.645
What is going on?

14:40.647 --> 14:42.013
They ambushed him.

14:42.015 --> 14:43.248
I think we got him h-here.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.315
Turn the lights on.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.884
I cannot hold him

14:45.886 --> 14:47.318
with your posterior in my face!

14:47.320 --> 14:49.153
Well, I'm aiming
his gun away from us.

14:49.155 --> 14:50.054
Happy, pull his mask off.

14:51.925 --> 14:53.057
What have you
been eating?!

14:53.059 --> 14:54.058
(gasping)

14:54.060 --> 14:55.960
(grunts)

14:55.962 --> 14:57.362
(groans)

14:57.364 --> 14:59.330
Okay.
Good, good.

14:59.332 --> 15:00.231
He's gone night-night.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.199
WALTER:
Okay...

15:01.201 --> 15:02.901
we have less than half an hour

15:02.903 --> 15:04.636
but that should be
more than enough.

15:04.638 --> 15:06.671
Here, guys, you can stay
on the comms with us,

15:06.673 --> 15:07.939
but I think we're okay.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.140
(sighs)

15:09.142 --> 15:10.642
(sighing):
Okay.

15:10.644 --> 15:13.578
In the meantime,
let's get to work helping

15:13.580 --> 15:14.946
Ralph win this case.

15:14.948 --> 15:16.447
Yeah.

15:21.554 --> 15:23.021
Okay, the air is clean
enough to breathe now.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.226
Let's get going
with the seismograph.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.699
Happy, how long
is it gonna take?

15:34.701 --> 15:36.134
Not long if you
don't distract me.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.703
(phone ringing)

15:38.705 --> 15:40.438
TOBY: You didn't tell her
you were out on a case?

15:40.440 --> 15:42.607
Hmm? Yeah, I did.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.042
And yet the damsel
still calls?

15:44.044 --> 15:45.209
Wow, she's jonesing bad.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.711
She does not have
Damsel Syndrome.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.063
She likes me for me.

15:48.064 --> 15:49.414
I am trying to pick up
microscopic tremors

15:49.416 --> 15:51.082
caused by the lock pins
when I hit the right number.

15:51.084 --> 15:53.117
I need quiet,
so both you damsels shut it.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.622
(low rumbling)

15:57.624 --> 15:59.157
What the heck was that?

15:59.159 --> 16:02.026
It's artillery practice
at the base firing range.

16:02.028 --> 16:03.311
We hear it, too.

16:03.312 --> 16:04.595
The vibrations are
screwing up my readings.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.631
I can't do my job with them
blasting away up there.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.499
Sly, can you
help us out here?

16:08.501 --> 16:09.734
Already in the base's system.

16:09.736 --> 16:10.668
I thought they
were air-gapped.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.370
Fort Knox Depository is,

16:12.372 --> 16:14.706
but the rest of the base
is online and vulnerable

16:14.708 --> 16:17.508
to my skills.

16:17.510 --> 16:18.710
Yahtzee!

16:18.712 --> 16:21.646
Okay, according to
their testing schedule,

16:21.648 --> 16:24.015
they are setting off a new
automated mortar launcher.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.217
It's gonna be going on
for another hour.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.552
You don't have that long.

16:27.554 --> 16:28.686
And I've only got two

16:28.688 --> 16:30.221
of the four
combination numbers.

16:30.223 --> 16:31.589
Try guessing the last two.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.591
There's 100 numbers on the dial,
two numbers left--

16:33.593 --> 16:35.493
that's 10,000 possibilities.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.494
(rumbling continues)

16:36.496 --> 16:38.396
We have to stop
the shelling.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.598
Cabe, I need you
to make a pit stop

16:40.600 --> 16:42.166
and, uh, you're not
gonna like it.

16:42.168 --> 16:44.702
Oh, boy.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.743
Short.

16:51.745 --> 16:54.712
Adjust 2 mills
and fire when ready.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.080
Wait.

16:56.082 --> 16:58.016
What in the...

17:01.021 --> 17:02.720
Hold your fire--
there's someone on the range.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.188
CABE:
Hold fire!

17:04.190 --> 17:06.491
Here we go.

17:06.493 --> 17:09.794
There are soldiers running
at us with rifles.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.362
Yup.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.363
Hide your comms.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.464
Get your badge out.

17:13.466 --> 17:15.633
We've got some
explaining to do.

17:18.271 --> 17:19.604
Problem, Officer?

17:19.606 --> 17:21.639
(clicking, beeps)
Got it!

17:36.723 --> 17:39.390
There's a lot of
rooms to search.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.225
Okay, okay,
we'll narrow it down.

17:41.227 --> 17:43.227
So, we'll take the year
that Fort Knox was built

17:43.229 --> 17:46.230
and how much gold historians
say was stored here,

17:46.232 --> 17:48.766
then divide it by how many bars
fit into each cell,

17:48.768 --> 17:51.469
and then consider the year
the scepter was brought

17:51.471 --> 17:52.954
to the vault so...

17:52.955 --> 17:54.438
Or we could just
check the manifest.

17:54.441 --> 17:55.807
It was hanging right
here on the wall.

17:55.809 --> 17:58.776
Scepter's in cell eight.

18:06.252 --> 18:07.485
PAIGE:
Heywood.

18:07.487 --> 18:08.586
Wh.. there you are, hey.

18:08.588 --> 18:09.721
Where's Ralph?

18:09.722 --> 18:10.855
Still searching
documents with Sly.

18:10.857 --> 18:11.856
You have to buy more time.

18:11.858 --> 18:13.391
The judge hates me already.

18:13.393 --> 18:14.859
If I buy more time,
he's gonna find me in contempt.

18:14.861 --> 18:15.860
Well, you'll figure
something out.

18:15.862 --> 18:16.978
You're a good lawyer.

18:16.979 --> 18:18.095
Were you not in court
this morning?

18:18.098 --> 18:19.497
I'm a terrible lawyer.

18:19.499 --> 18:21.099
That's not true.

18:21.101 --> 18:21.866
Y-you care about your clients,

18:21.868 --> 18:22.867
that's more than most lawyers.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.103
Ask yourself:

18:25.105 --> 18:27.438
why are you an attorney instead
of anything else in the world?

18:27.440 --> 18:29.240
I know there's
an important reason.

18:32.112 --> 18:35.546
Uh... w-when I was a kid
our oil burner broke.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.648
Our house was freezing.

18:37.650 --> 18:39.817
The guys my mother
hired to fix it

18:39.819 --> 18:41.552
just made it worse,

18:41.553 --> 18:43.286
so, she took them
to small claims court.

18:44.891 --> 18:48.126
$380 bucks,

18:48.128 --> 18:50.528
but it was all we had,

18:50.530 --> 18:52.597
and, uh, she won.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.265
So...

18:54.267 --> 18:57.835
our house was warm once again.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.537
I guess-I guess that's why

18:59.539 --> 19:01.539
I want to protect
the little guy, too.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.407
Well, you don't get
more little than Ralph.

19:04.744 --> 19:06.611
Go make your mom proud, okay?

19:06.613 --> 19:08.613
I will.

19:08.615 --> 19:12.216
Bailiff, take Mr. Morris into
custody for contempt of court.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.185
I asked for an expert
What?!

19:14.187 --> 19:16.187
to testify to your client's
competency PAIGE: Oh, God.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.256
and you give me a story
about a doctor Oh, God.

19:18.258 --> 19:19.924
being stuck in Fort Knox!

19:19.926 --> 19:21.492
You did great;
you got Ralph more time.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.877
I can't go to County.

19:22.878 --> 19:24.261
I lost a bunch of cases
for guys in there.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.696
We need Toby to testify!

19:25.698 --> 19:27.465
You got to get Toby
back in here!

19:29.903 --> 19:32.770
Are you sure it's
on a pressure plate?

19:32.772 --> 19:33.804
See how the
interior ridge

19:33.806 --> 19:34.805
is just above
the outer frame?

19:34.807 --> 19:36.007
Well, that's
'cause the springs

19:36.008 --> 19:37.208
are compressed
by the weight of the scepter.

19:37.210 --> 19:38.726
Okay...

19:38.727 --> 19:40.243
we lift it,
something bad happens.

19:40.246 --> 19:42.246
Who built this place,
a Bond villain?

19:42.248 --> 19:43.748
We can do it.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.216
Really?
What makes you think

19:45.218 --> 19:46.584
you can handle
a switcheroo

19:46.586 --> 19:48.452
Indiana Jones couldn't pull off?

19:48.454 --> 19:50.321
A giant boulder
almost crushed him.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.355
Who's Indiana Jones?

19:51.357 --> 19:52.423
A state senator?

19:53.826 --> 19:55.877
I am a mechanic.

19:55.878 --> 19:57.929
I spend my life eyeballing
weights and measures.

19:57.931 --> 19:59.664
Sly, you got eyes
on the scepter?

19:59.666 --> 20:00.665
Already calculating its weight.

20:00.667 --> 20:02.233
The volume of a cylinder

20:02.235 --> 20:03.501
is pi-r-squared times height.

20:03.503 --> 20:06.771
The spherical top is
four-thirds pi-r-cubed.

20:06.773 --> 20:08.873
The weight of gold
is a constant, and, uh,

20:08.875 --> 20:09.941
I'm gonna have to
guestimate on the jewels

20:09.943 --> 20:11.342
but I'm gonna be close...

20:11.344 --> 20:13.477
six pounds, four ounces.

20:17.984 --> 20:19.984
Okay, that should do it.

20:19.986 --> 20:20.818
You sure?

20:20.820 --> 20:22.286
I know tools.

20:22.288 --> 20:24.071
They'll match the weight

20:24.072 --> 20:25.855
within a fraction of an ounce.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.759
(sighs)

20:28.761 --> 20:30.928
Okay, on three.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.330
One...

20:32.332 --> 20:34.298
Two...

20:34.300 --> 20:35.533
Three!

20:38.538 --> 20:39.937
(laughs)

20:39.939 --> 20:41.505
Take that, Fort Knox.

20:41.507 --> 20:43.374
It's more like Fort Not..

20:43.977 --> 20:46.544
Gonna Stop Us
'Cause We're Geniuses...

20:48.982 --> 20:50.514
(alarm blaring)

20:51.718 --> 20:52.950
That's a problem.

20:52.952 --> 20:53.884
What's going on?

20:55.288 --> 20:57.255
Please, don't be a boulder.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.657
(rumbling)

21:01.561 --> 21:04.495
All right, that-that
is worse than a boulder.

21:04.497 --> 21:05.963
They must be feeding a pipe
from a storage tank

21:05.965 --> 21:07.632
that is just
enough water

21:07.634 --> 21:09.017
to fill the room and kill us.

21:09.018 --> 21:10.401
I guess this is one
of the unknown traps

21:10.403 --> 21:11.502
that Cook
warned us about!

21:11.504 --> 21:12.536
Okay, how did we
trip this thing?

21:12.538 --> 21:13.571
Our calculations were perfect!

21:13.573 --> 21:14.572
WALTER:
There's not enough time!

21:14.574 --> 21:15.640
Here, here! Come here!

21:15.642 --> 21:16.641
The water's filling.

21:16.643 --> 21:17.975
Come help me with the door.

21:17.977 --> 21:19.577
There's a water trap in there?

21:19.579 --> 21:21.512
Guys, that room
is incredibly small.

21:21.514 --> 21:22.913
How fast is the water entering?

21:22.915 --> 21:23.948
Fast enough!

21:23.950 --> 21:25.349
This thing isn't budging.

21:25.351 --> 21:26.350
We can't get
out this way.

21:26.352 --> 21:27.551
We've got to
find something

21:27.553 --> 21:28.919
to stop up the hole.

21:28.921 --> 21:29.920
No, let the water in!

21:29.922 --> 21:31.222
With the door straining

21:31.223 --> 21:32.523
against the pressure
of a room full of water

21:32.525 --> 21:33.758
it'll be vulnerable.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.093
WALTER:
He's right!

21:35.094 --> 21:36.427
It's Archimedes'
Law of the Lever.

21:36.429 --> 21:38.046
If the distance
from the fulcrum

21:38.047 --> 21:39.664
to where the input force
is applied is greater than

21:39.666 --> 21:40.832
the distance
from the fulcrum

21:40.833 --> 21:41.999
to where the output
force is applied,

21:42.001 --> 21:44.568
then the lever amplifies
the input force.

21:44.570 --> 21:46.070
You're saying we need a crowbar?

21:46.072 --> 21:47.538
Yes, exactly! Start looking!

22:00.620 --> 22:01.852
Would He-Man's
sword work?

22:02.588 --> 22:04.422
These wavy patterns indicate

22:04.424 --> 22:05.923
Damascus steel,
some of the toughest

22:05.925 --> 22:07.591
in history.

22:07.593 --> 22:09.727
Okay, okay,
let's pull together.

22:20.073 --> 22:21.605
This thing isn't budging.

22:21.607 --> 22:24.508
If anyone notices
the water getting warmer,

22:24.510 --> 22:25.843
it's just 'cause
I'm scared.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.845
Come on, guys,
you can do this.

22:27.847 --> 22:28.846
Okay.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.414
On my count!

22:30.416 --> 22:31.916
We take one last breath...
Okay.

22:31.918 --> 22:35.686
...and then we give
it everything we got! Okay?

22:35.688 --> 22:37.655
(all inhaling)

22:41.661 --> 22:43.627
(door groaning)

22:46.799 --> 22:48.899
(rumbling)

23:00.580 --> 23:01.946
(gasping)

23:01.948 --> 23:04.749
Everyone okay?

23:04.751 --> 23:05.616
Good. Happy?

23:05.618 --> 23:06.617
Never better.

23:06.619 --> 23:07.818
Okay, the door's compromised.

23:07.820 --> 23:09.720
Now we can open it
and beat it.

23:09.722 --> 23:10.921
Good, 'cause the guards
here might be passed out

23:10.923 --> 23:12.123
but no way an alarm
wasn't tripped

23:12.125 --> 23:13.458
to Steelson headquarters.

23:13.459 --> 23:14.792
There's gonna be men
here any minute.

23:20.600 --> 23:23.067
I know I had
the weight right.

23:23.069 --> 23:25.002
Mistakes happen,
even to super geniuses.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.871
Not this one. This doesn't feel
like six pounds.

23:26.873 --> 23:29.106
It's light.

23:29.108 --> 23:31.642
Well, they don't make scepters
like they used to.

23:31.644 --> 23:32.643
Guys...

23:32.645 --> 23:34.078
we've got a problem.

23:35.515 --> 23:36.781
(elevator bell dings)

23:37.817 --> 23:39.550
Not as big as this one!

23:43.956 --> 23:46.056
Now they can't get in.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.992
And we can't get out.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.549
Even if they get the combo
from their superiors,

23:55.550 --> 23:57.033
the gears will be jammed.
That should slow them down.

23:57.036 --> 23:58.769
Good, let's go.

24:01.707 --> 24:03.808
Now let's focus
on that vial,

24:03.810 --> 24:06.010
AKA the real reason Cook sent us
in here and let me point out,

24:06.012 --> 24:07.912
it was I who referenced
the Stallone film

24:07.914 --> 24:08.913
where the heroes
get screwed.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.214
Does everyone
remember that?

24:10.215 --> 24:11.514
It's like a dust,
like a powder.

24:11.517 --> 24:12.683
Yeah, it's silvery,

24:12.685 --> 24:14.752
it's-it's gray
with a shimmer.

24:14.754 --> 24:15.986
Whoever hid this
chose gold.

24:15.988 --> 24:17.455
Gold's good at
shielding radiation.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.923
I think I'm holding polonium.

24:18.925 --> 24:19.924
Put that down.

24:19.926 --> 24:21.125
That's what killed the MI6 agent

24:21.127 --> 24:22.226
that defected from the KGB.

24:22.228 --> 24:23.894
Walt, this stuff is crazy toxic.

24:23.896 --> 24:25.930
One gram can kill
ten million people.

24:25.932 --> 24:27.465
Okay...

24:27.467 --> 24:29.033
we're safe as long as
we don't ingest it.

24:29.035 --> 24:30.201
There's got to be
half a pound here.

24:30.203 --> 24:31.502
That could wipe out

24:31.504 --> 24:32.803
a quarter of
the world's population.

24:34.240 --> 24:37.107
Imagine this dispersed from
a crop duster in the Midwest,

24:37.109 --> 24:39.143
from the top of a skyscraper
in Beijing.

24:39.145 --> 24:40.744
Agent Cook would only
keep this from us

24:40.746 --> 24:42.480
if he had bad plans
for this vial.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.999
Sly, I need you
to look into Cook.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.517
Talk to Cabe, see if he can give
you any background on the guy.

24:47.520 --> 24:48.586
I've been trying
to get in touch with him

24:48.588 --> 24:49.620
but his comms aren't in.

24:50.556 --> 24:52.122
Okay.

24:52.124 --> 24:53.557
Everything checks out
with the Colonel.

24:53.559 --> 24:54.558
Yeah...

24:54.560 --> 24:55.559
really embarrassed by all this.

24:55.561 --> 24:57.178
We, uh...

24:57.179 --> 24:58.796
just took a wrong turn
on an access road,

24:58.798 --> 25:01.031
wound up out here instead
of heading toward the exit.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.433
Yes, sir.

25:02.434 --> 25:03.834
Well, now you need
to find that exit

25:03.836 --> 25:04.902
because you've delayed
our training.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.037
Understood.

25:07.039 --> 25:09.707
Let's get out of here.

25:09.709 --> 25:10.808
SYLVESTER:
Cabe, where are you?

25:10.810 --> 25:11.942
All right, I'm here.

25:11.944 --> 25:13.777
Are we almost wrapped up?

25:13.779 --> 25:15.613
Well, we hit a speed bump.

25:15.615 --> 25:16.847
We're not getting
through it.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.616
If we follow the pipe
to the reservoir tank

25:18.618 --> 25:19.667
we might get out of here.

25:19.668 --> 25:20.717
It's only a matter of time
before Steelson

25:20.720 --> 25:22.086
cuts through
that vault door.

25:22.088 --> 25:23.087
That's it.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.472
We cut through the bars.

25:24.473 --> 25:25.856
You have a standard pipe
cutter in the tool box.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.691
It's not getting through steel.
It will with a

25:27.693 --> 25:29.593
diamond blade.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.195
I go four blocks

25:31.197 --> 25:32.196
to the courthouse and

25:32.198 --> 25:33.648
all hell breaks loose.

25:33.649 --> 25:35.099
Apparently, but I can't
discuss it right now

25:35.101 --> 25:37.768
because I am gathering
info on Cook.

25:37.770 --> 25:39.537
Walter, you guys
close to breaking out?

25:39.539 --> 25:40.638
Getting there.

25:41.707 --> 25:42.818
So are they.

25:42.819 --> 25:43.930
They're cutting
through pretty quick.

25:43.931 --> 25:45.042
Paige, we'll be in
the pipe in moments.

25:45.044 --> 25:46.110
We're okay,
we got this.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.244
All right, well, keep us posted.

25:47.246 --> 25:48.979
Got it.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.281
Toby, get down here!

25:50.283 --> 25:51.282
We're leaving!

25:51.284 --> 25:52.550
WALTER: Come on!

25:52.552 --> 25:53.717
(metal grinding)

25:53.719 --> 25:54.952
Walter, we're almost
at the rendezvous.

25:54.954 --> 25:56.086
What's your 20?

25:56.088 --> 25:57.121
For the second
time today,

25:57.123 --> 25:58.289
very close to
Toby's backside.

25:58.291 --> 26:01.091
Could be as toxic
as the polonium.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.660
About that, I can't look
into Cook because

26:02.662 --> 26:03.894
I don't know
who his friends are

26:03.896 --> 26:05.012
and I don't want to tip him off

26:05.013 --> 26:06.129
that we found
his hidden treasure.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.898
Voices are starting to echo.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.967
Means there's
an open chamber.

26:09.969 --> 26:12.069
Okay.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.804
(grunting): This is where
the water came from.

26:13.806 --> 26:16.173
Must be a hatch they use
to fill the tank, right?

26:16.175 --> 26:17.708
It's just a valve.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.226
Judging from the size of it,

26:19.227 --> 26:20.743
I'm guessing they fill
this thing with a hose

26:20.746 --> 26:22.046
connected to a tanker truck.
Oh, great.

26:22.048 --> 26:23.314
So we crawled
into a dead end.

26:23.316 --> 26:25.849
This tank is
buried underground.

26:25.851 --> 26:27.651
(metal clinks)

26:27.653 --> 26:28.919
They're almost in.

26:28.921 --> 26:30.020
Well, at least we're
already six feet under.

26:30.022 --> 26:31.055
It saves time with the burying.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.623
From the distance and angle

26:32.625 --> 26:34.258
at which we crawled

26:34.259 --> 26:35.892
I would estimate more like
three feet underground.

26:35.895 --> 26:37.061
Oh, thanks for clearing that up.

26:37.063 --> 26:38.362
I wouldn't want
my last words on earth

26:38.364 --> 26:39.697
to be a meaningless
mathematical error.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.199
It's not meaningless.
It's meaningful.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.700
That three feet makes all
the difference in the world.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.218
Cabe?

26:44.219 --> 26:45.735
How far are you from
the artillery range?

26:45.738 --> 26:47.671
I need you to commandeer
a mortar launcher.

26:47.673 --> 26:48.739
What?!

26:48.741 --> 26:50.074
That's a no-go, son.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.242
I'm already off the base,
and I'm glad I am

26:52.244 --> 26:53.777
because you've lost your mind.

26:53.778 --> 26:55.311
Actually, being on the base
doesn't matter.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.147
At the artillery field, I got
a good look at their equipment.

26:57.149 --> 26:58.148
Some of those launchers,

26:58.150 --> 26:59.617
they're automated.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.085
That makes them potentially
vulnerable to hackers.

27:01.087 --> 27:03.087
When it comes to hacking,
there's no "potentially"

27:03.089 --> 27:04.088
with us.

27:04.090 --> 27:05.623
What do you need
this weapon for?

27:05.625 --> 27:06.924
To blow a hole in this tank.

27:06.926 --> 27:08.325
That's funny.
For a second,

27:08.327 --> 27:10.160
I thought he was suggesting
they drop a bomb on us.

27:10.162 --> 27:12.196
Standard mortar round,
three feet of dirt,

27:12.198 --> 27:14.298
half inch steel tank...
it might work.

27:14.300 --> 27:15.666
Might kill us.

27:15.668 --> 27:17.001
Okay, I'm in.

27:17.002 --> 27:18.335
<i> I have control of one</i>
<i> of the mortar launchers.</i>

27:22.341 --> 27:23.907
The guards are in the vault now.

27:23.909 --> 27:24.942
They'll be on us in any minute.

27:24.944 --> 27:27.011
Sly, we crawled about 60 feet

27:27.013 --> 27:28.212
at a seven degree incline

27:28.214 --> 27:30.147
from the vault room, so...

27:30.149 --> 27:32.349
Check a map and
estimate the coordinates

27:32.351 --> 27:33.784
and fire that mortar.

27:33.786 --> 27:34.969
Okay...

27:34.970 --> 27:36.153
but I'm not gonna
be exact on this.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.122
This is not something
you want to estimate.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.190
This is not something
you estimate!

27:40.192 --> 27:41.725
I can hear the guards
entering the pipe.

27:41.727 --> 27:42.760
Launch the mortar now.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.662
Okay.

27:44.664 --> 27:45.929
Here goes nothing.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.365
Incoming.

27:51.170 --> 27:52.369
He launched it,
let's get in the pipe.

27:56.042 --> 27:57.941
(phone ringing)

27:57.943 --> 27:59.043
Is that Linda?

27:59.045 --> 28:00.010
You kidding me?
Um...

28:00.012 --> 28:01.011
(phone ringing)

28:01.013 --> 28:03.213
(explosion rumbling)

28:08.020 --> 28:08.919
Walter, can you hear me?!

28:08.921 --> 28:10.888
Speak up, son.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.257
You're making us
nervous over here.

28:17.329 --> 28:19.296
(grunting)

28:19.298 --> 28:20.731
We're okay.

28:20.733 --> 28:21.765
Oh!

28:21.767 --> 28:23.801
Oh, thank God.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.402
These guys are insane.

28:25.404 --> 28:28.272
These guys are gonna
give me a heart attack.

28:28.274 --> 28:30.340
(coughing)

28:42.354 --> 28:43.987
Oh, it's my shadow.

28:43.989 --> 28:45.355
Six more weeks of winter.

28:47.359 --> 28:48.675
Forget six weeks of winter.

28:48.676 --> 28:49.992
If we don't hurry
it'll be 20 to life

28:49.995 --> 28:50.994
in prison!

28:50.996 --> 28:52.062
Come on, let's go!

28:56.402 --> 28:58.502
Freeze!

28:59.472 --> 29:00.738
Walter, I found
something on Cook.

29:00.740 --> 29:02.005
I'm sending it
to your phone.

29:02.007 --> 29:03.207
Little busy now, Sly!

29:03.209 --> 29:04.208
Walter...

29:04.210 --> 29:05.242
you need to see this.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.744
Download us...!

29:06.746 --> 29:08.445
bullet points!

29:08.447 --> 29:11.699
I hacked his intelligence
service record.

29:11.700 --> 29:14.952
27 years ago, Cook was a secret
U.S. operative in East Germany.

29:14.954 --> 29:17.321
One of his contacts
included a man in a WMD program

29:17.323 --> 29:20.324
in East Germany,
and his specialty

29:20.326 --> 29:22.226
was radioactive weaponry.

29:22.227 --> 29:24.127
When the wall came down,
he hid his radioactive material

29:24.130 --> 29:25.796
in the scepter figuring
what could be safer.

29:25.798 --> 29:28.132
And when Poland claimed
the piece was originally theirs,

29:28.134 --> 29:29.933
then the scepter
and its contents made its way

29:29.935 --> 29:31.402
to Fort Knox.

29:31.403 --> 29:32.870
Polonium is incredibly rare
in nature.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.037
You can't get your hands
on this stuff.

29:34.039 --> 29:36.206
Black market must be huge.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.541
So Cook saw
an opportunity

29:37.543 --> 29:39.376
in the security
change at Knox,

29:39.378 --> 29:40.778
and he jumped at it.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.846
(panting)

29:43.816 --> 29:45.149
Okay.

29:45.151 --> 29:47.417
I think we lost them
but not for long.

29:47.419 --> 29:48.552
All right,
let's get our bearings.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.421
Oh, man, that's Cook.

29:53.225 --> 29:54.558
That's a problem.

29:57.830 --> 29:59.930
Uh, he's gonna want this
weapon of mass destruction.

29:59.932 --> 30:00.931
What do we do?

30:00.933 --> 30:02.266
I have a plan.

30:09.909 --> 30:11.375
What the hell

30:11.377 --> 30:12.576
did you guys do back there?

30:12.578 --> 30:14.144
The whole place
is lit up.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.479
Did you get the scepter?

30:15.481 --> 30:16.480
We did.

30:16.482 --> 30:18.348
Happy, give it to him.

30:21.554 --> 30:23.954
Good work, Scorpion.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.823
Your country thanks you
for a job well done.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.424
Now I'd get lost if I were you.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.293
TOBY:
W-wait, uh...

30:29.295 --> 30:31.461
you forgot a diamond.

30:31.463 --> 30:33.497
It's a little smudged,

30:33.499 --> 30:35.465
'cause, uh, we used it
to cut through steel.

30:35.467 --> 30:37.434
Oh.

30:37.436 --> 30:38.535
Okay.

30:44.610 --> 30:47.177
(engine starts)

30:56.388 --> 30:58.088
You guys just let

30:58.090 --> 31:00.424
a man go with enough
radioactive material

31:00.426 --> 31:02.092
to take out a continent.

31:02.094 --> 31:05.062
I hope you know
what you're doing.

31:05.064 --> 31:06.063
Me, too.

31:06.065 --> 31:08.465
Guys, listen up,

31:08.467 --> 31:09.533
<i> So, Toby, I need two pinecones</i>

31:09.535 --> 31:11.368
<i> and, Happy, I need gunpowder.</i>

31:11.370 --> 31:14.171
These are the biggest
pinecones I could find

31:14.173 --> 31:15.606
with sap on them.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.040
Should be sticky enough
to hold the gun powder.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.942
How many bullets
did Tim give you?

31:20.179 --> 31:22.112
Six, more than enough.

31:22.114 --> 31:23.247
Do you see Tim and Cabe?

31:23.249 --> 31:25.082
WALTER:
No, they're well hidden.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.383
This is dumb.

31:26.385 --> 31:29.286
The idea of breaking back
into Knox is crazy enough

31:29.288 --> 31:31.121
but waiting here
in the hopes we can take out

31:31.123 --> 31:33.056
those guards on our tail
is wishful thinking.

31:33.058 --> 31:35.125
If we run into the woods now
and get caught, it's over.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.261
It's worth the wait.
Anyway, shut up, they're here.

31:44.637 --> 31:46.069
It's running.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.304
Maybe this was
their getaway car,

31:47.306 --> 31:49.039
but they couldn't find it
in the woods.

31:49.041 --> 31:50.407
I'm calling it in.

31:50.409 --> 31:53.210
Sorry, thought
I could park here.

31:55.247 --> 31:57.547
Better than knockout gas.

31:57.549 --> 31:59.082
Woods are clear. Get moving.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.484
Copy that.

32:00.486 --> 32:02.286
COLONEL FONTENOT:
MP's are on the way

32:02.288 --> 32:03.253
to investigate the vault.

32:03.255 --> 32:04.288
Remain on high alert.

32:04.290 --> 32:05.923
Yes, sir.

32:12.197 --> 32:13.614
Okay, give me the lighter.

32:13.615 --> 32:15.032
(whispering):
This plan is nuts.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.400
(whispering):
Actually, the plan is seeds.

32:16.402 --> 32:19.036
When the seeds heat up
they will pop like gunfire.

32:19.038 --> 32:20.070
Trust me.

32:20.072 --> 32:21.238
How can I trust someone

32:21.240 --> 32:23.240
who just made
a nuts and seeds pun?

32:25.678 --> 32:26.710
Okay.

32:26.712 --> 32:28.378
Hold that.

32:33.652 --> 32:34.685
(seeds crack and pop)

32:34.687 --> 32:36.153
Gunfire at 10:00!

32:36.155 --> 32:37.421
Multiple shooters!
Spread out!

32:37.423 --> 32:39.256
Fan out!

32:39.258 --> 32:41.291
Here's your hall pass.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.659
Don't let the
principal catch you.

33:03.482 --> 33:04.548
(badge smacks)

33:20.199 --> 33:21.264
I swear I had it.

33:21.266 --> 33:22.265
Look...

33:22.267 --> 33:23.467
I'm DOD.

33:23.469 --> 33:26.069
(phone rings)

33:26.071 --> 33:27.371
Private Davis,
Main Gate.

33:27.373 --> 33:29.239
He's here with me now.

33:29.241 --> 33:30.774
Understood.

33:30.776 --> 33:33.176
So, it's squared away?

33:33.178 --> 33:34.778
Agent Cook, you're under arrest.

33:34.779 --> 33:36.379
(gun clicks) Hands on the wheel.
Hold on!

33:36.382 --> 33:38.215
This is a mistake!
Hands on the wheel!

33:39.218 --> 33:40.384
Your ID's been found...

33:40.386 --> 33:41.451
in the vault.

33:50.229 --> 33:52.129
Sir...

33:56.368 --> 33:58.802
Those bastards.

34:05.377 --> 34:06.376
JUDGE: Ms. Dineen,

34:06.378 --> 34:07.577
have you had your son

34:07.579 --> 34:08.712
evaluated for competency?

34:08.714 --> 34:09.947
Yes, Your Honor.

34:09.948 --> 34:11.181
Dr. Curtis here
has a full report.

34:11.183 --> 34:12.282
Hep.

34:12.284 --> 34:13.901
Mr. Curtis, are you
a real doctor?

34:13.902 --> 34:15.519
Harvard Medical School
with a Masters in...

34:15.521 --> 34:17.387
Hep. Is the kid competent?

34:17.389 --> 34:18.388
Absolutely.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.523
A fact I was well

34:19.525 --> 34:20.524
aware of from the outset.

34:20.526 --> 34:22.426
Where is his counsel?

34:22.428 --> 34:24.128
HEYWOOD: I'm right here,
Your Honor.

34:24.129 --> 34:25.829
Since I was incarcerated,
I didn't have

34:25.831 --> 34:28.365
a chance to confer
with my client.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.434
Ten seconds, then get to it.

34:32.538 --> 34:34.304
Will I seem like
a prepared lawyer

34:34.306 --> 34:35.439
or an ill-prepared lawyer?

34:35.441 --> 34:37.140
Prepared.

34:37.142 --> 34:38.375
Sweet.

34:41.513 --> 34:44.347
Ralph, you had the opportunity
to review the work product

34:44.349 --> 34:46.483
that your professor
claims is his own.

34:46.485 --> 34:47.484
I did.

34:47.486 --> 34:49.453
Tell me what you uncovered.

34:49.454 --> 34:51.421
I work on and revise
many aspects of the code

34:51.423 --> 34:54.458
at the same time,
so to keep from getting lost

34:54.460 --> 34:57.427
I use bookmarks,
specific dates.

34:57.429 --> 34:59.429
Ralph, can you point out
these placeholders?

34:59.431 --> 35:00.464
Objection, Your Honor.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.833
My client uses
bookmarks as well.

35:02.835 --> 35:04.835
There's no way to prove
anything in there came

35:04.837 --> 35:06.670
from this child.
I can prove it.

35:06.672 --> 35:07.771
Overruled.

35:07.773 --> 35:09.439
Go ahead.

35:09.441 --> 35:11.408
I use dates that
are important to me.

35:11.410 --> 35:15.812
The first here is my birthday,
12-11-2005,

35:15.814 --> 35:18.215
important because
I enjoy my life.

35:18.217 --> 35:20.283
Birth certificate,
stamped and certified,

35:20.285 --> 35:21.485
(whispering):
like it totally should be.

35:21.487 --> 35:22.819
RALPH:
Directly under it,

35:22.821 --> 35:25.522
4-13-1986,

35:25.524 --> 35:27.374
my mom's birthday.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.225
Important because
her mothering instincts

35:29.228 --> 35:30.494
are superlative.

35:30.496 --> 35:31.528
Her license.

35:31.530 --> 35:32.863
Really on my game today.

35:34.500 --> 35:35.732
And on that page,

35:35.734 --> 35:37.834
9-22-2014,

35:37.836 --> 35:40.303
the day I first met
Walter O'Brien.

35:42.574 --> 35:44.608
That's important because

35:44.610 --> 35:46.743
it's the day I realized
I wasn't alone.

35:46.745 --> 35:49.746
He taught me there
were others like me

35:49.748 --> 35:51.515
who cared about me.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.316
Um...

35:53.318 --> 35:55.385
I can verify
that date with, uh,

35:55.387 --> 35:57.721
an invoice from the owner
of Nemos Diner

35:57.723 --> 36:01.158
where I was fixing a router
and when I first met Ms. Dineen

36:01.160 --> 36:02.893
and her amazing son, Ralph.

36:02.895 --> 36:04.861
I didn't ask.

36:07.299 --> 36:09.466
Okay, it's just, uh...

36:10.903 --> 36:12.736
...it was a very important day
in my life, too.

36:14.573 --> 36:16.907
I'm gonna quit while I'm ahead.

36:16.909 --> 36:19.643
Defense, any cross?

36:19.645 --> 36:22.812
We have nothing
at this time.

36:22.814 --> 36:24.347
Then I have a ruling.

36:24.349 --> 36:27.284
Your client should be
ashamed of himself.

36:27.286 --> 36:29.619
I rule in favor of Plaintiff.

36:29.621 --> 36:30.921
(cheering)

36:30.923 --> 36:32.556
He hit the little hammer
in my favor.

36:33.592 --> 36:34.691
It's the first time ever.

36:34.693 --> 36:35.692
(laughing)

36:35.694 --> 36:36.760
I'm a winner!

36:36.762 --> 36:38.195
Yeah!

36:42.634 --> 36:43.934
I keep thinking
the judge is gonna call

36:43.936 --> 36:45.402
and reverse the decision,

36:45.404 --> 36:46.636
but it's not legal.

36:46.638 --> 36:47.704
I checked.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.839
You did an amazing job.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.575
Oh, thanks.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.677
You have a really fantastic
group of people here.

36:53.679 --> 36:56.580
Supportive... forgiving.

36:56.582 --> 36:59.516
Um, and I just wanted
to thank you for...

36:59.518 --> 37:01.551
for helping me
believe in myself.

37:01.553 --> 37:02.852
You should.

37:02.854 --> 37:05.255
You're... a really good lawyer.

37:05.257 --> 37:06.489
Thank you.

37:06.491 --> 37:08.558
(phone ringing)

37:08.560 --> 37:10.927
Oh, it's my mom.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.563
Yeah, hi, Mom. Yeah, I won.

37:13.565 --> 37:16.566
Uh-huh, yeah,
I can't believe it either.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.734
Hey, buddy.

37:22.441 --> 37:25.442
It means a lot to me

37:25.444 --> 37:28.912
that you put the day that
we first met in your code.

37:28.914 --> 37:32.415
I'm sorry for being curt
with you before.

37:32.417 --> 37:33.483
It's okay.

37:33.485 --> 37:34.584
No, it's not.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.920
I, um...

37:36.922 --> 37:38.421
it won't happen again.

37:39.691 --> 37:41.625
I do, though, believe

37:41.627 --> 37:44.694
in what I said.

37:44.696 --> 37:45.895
Okay?

37:45.897 --> 37:47.998
I couldn't understand

37:48.000 --> 37:50.767
the details
in your incredibly complex code.

37:51.536 --> 37:53.870
I used to think
that I-I had

37:53.872 --> 37:55.672
the fourth highest
IQ in the world,

37:55.674 --> 38:00.677
but now I realized that you have
dropped me down to number five.

38:00.679 --> 38:02.912
That's what got you upset?

38:02.914 --> 38:04.648
(laughing): No.

38:04.650 --> 38:08.785
No, what upset me is that
you were willing to slow down

38:08.787 --> 38:10.687
for me to-to let me
go down the wrong road,

38:10.689 --> 38:12.055
when that would've hindered you,

38:12.057 --> 38:14.958
because I couldn't
grasp your work.

38:14.960 --> 38:18.662
Never hobble your intelligence
for anyone...

38:18.664 --> 38:21.331
because if you do that
in this garage,

38:21.333 --> 38:24.501
imagine what you'll
have to do out there...

38:24.503 --> 38:26.703
for humans.

38:26.705 --> 38:29.873
The world needs
to catch up to you...

38:29.875 --> 38:32.475
because if-if it can,
just a little,

38:32.477 --> 38:34.577
imagine what a...

38:34.579 --> 38:36.680
a beautiful place it could be.

38:36.682 --> 38:38.682
(door opens)

38:38.684 --> 38:40.717
CABE:
Hey, Walter.

38:40.719 --> 38:43.553
You have a visitor.

38:43.555 --> 38:44.587
WALTER:
Oh, hey...

38:44.589 --> 38:45.722
Linda...

38:48.360 --> 38:50.727
Um, thanks for meeting me here.

38:51.830 --> 38:52.896
You... are you ready?

38:52.898 --> 38:54.764
Looks like a fun party.

38:54.766 --> 38:55.665
We can stay.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.534
You can finish
your plate.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.369
Oh, yes, the, uh,
the jalapeno poppers.

38:59.371 --> 39:01.805
They're... actually,
the capsaicin in the jalapeno

39:01.807 --> 39:03.106
has many health benefits.

39:03.108 --> 39:04.941
Cool, I'll give one a shot.

39:04.943 --> 39:06.776
Oh, no, no, no!

39:06.778 --> 39:08.611
There's corn in the batter, yeah.
Oh.

39:08.613 --> 39:10.046
Ooh! (chuckles)

39:10.047 --> 39:11.480
Yeah, uh, I-I remember
on our first date

39:11.483 --> 39:13.100
you said you were allergic, right?
Oh.

39:13.101 --> 39:14.718
(laughs) Yeah, you think
I would know that.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.119
Yeah.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.388
Uh, actually,
I did know that.

39:20.692 --> 39:23.960
But you were gonna
eat it anyway?

39:23.962 --> 39:27.063
Guess you make me adventurous.

39:28.967 --> 39:31.568
Linda, may I ask you a question?

39:31.570 --> 39:32.969
Of course.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.704
Do you really like me?

39:34.706 --> 39:36.806
Or does being around me

39:36.808 --> 39:40.643
remind you of a sense memory
when you were saved,

39:40.645 --> 39:42.712
and that's what you,
uh, really like?

39:42.714 --> 39:45.415
Is... because I-I think
it's the latter.

39:45.417 --> 39:46.716
That's crazy.
Is it?

39:46.718 --> 39:48.017
(chuckles)
Is, um...

39:48.019 --> 39:51.121
do you really like
fermented fish and-and,

39:51.123 --> 39:53.556
uh, smelly flowers?

39:53.558 --> 39:58.561
D-Do you like a guy who likes
those-those kind of things?

40:00.132 --> 40:01.931
Wow.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.735
I'm not sure.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.837
Uh...

40:07.839 --> 40:09.939
it would explain how

40:09.941 --> 40:14.043
I sat through that documentary
on African bee migration.

40:16.548 --> 40:19.616
Well, that's, uh, it's-it's okay
that you don't really like me.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.152
(sighs)

40:22.154 --> 40:23.853
But...

40:23.855 --> 40:25.855
what you're doing for me

40:25.857 --> 40:27.891
right now makes me...

40:27.893 --> 40:29.793
like you.

40:30.829 --> 40:33.863
Just not in-in that kind of way.

40:33.865 --> 40:36.766
(sighs)

40:36.768 --> 40:38.835
It's okay, it's okay.

40:38.837 --> 40:40.904
I understand.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.541
Uh...

40:44.543 --> 40:45.909
still friends?

40:45.911 --> 40:47.710
(laughs)

40:47.712 --> 40:49.813
Always friends.

40:53.685 --> 40:56.186
Oh, yeah.

40:58.957 --> 40:59.956
(sighs)

40:59.958 --> 41:02.759
Um...

41:02.761 --> 41:05.462
good-bye, smarty-pants.

41:05.464 --> 41:06.529
(chuckles)

41:08.900 --> 41:10.700
(sighs)

41:10.702 --> 41:11.734
Hey.
Hi.

41:11.736 --> 41:13.503
I just wanted to say bye.

41:13.505 --> 41:15.672
I'm getting on a plane
going to Seattle,

41:15.674 --> 41:17.640
uh, see a specialist
about my back,

41:17.642 --> 41:18.875
hopefully get cleared for duty.

41:18.877 --> 41:19.876
Oh.

41:19.878 --> 41:21.478
I hope that works out for you.

41:21.480 --> 41:22.846
Me, too. Um,

41:22.848 --> 41:26.783
regardless, I was thinking
when I got back,

41:26.785 --> 41:30.887
maybe you and I could
get a meal together...

41:30.889 --> 41:32.255
at a restaurant--

41:32.257 --> 41:34.157
a real restaurant,
not Kovelsky's.

41:34.159 --> 41:35.258
(chuckles)

41:35.260 --> 41:37.227
Oh, like a...

41:37.229 --> 41:39.562
date?
Date, yes.

41:39.564 --> 41:41.498
Only if you'd like.

41:44.769 --> 41:46.736
Yeah, I would love to.

41:46.738 --> 41:48.671
Great.

41:48.673 --> 41:50.415
Would you look at them?
He's dealing with her,

41:50.416 --> 41:52.158
she's dealing with him,
and they should be

41:52.159 --> 41:53.901
dealing with each other.
They're morons.

41:53.902 --> 41:55.644
That's never gonna be us--
we keep it easy, right?

41:56.748 --> 41:58.281
Whoa.
Oh, oh...

41:58.283 --> 42:01.084
King Klutz over here, I'm sorry.

42:02.587 --> 42:04.687
Okay, Doc, I'll live.

42:05.657 --> 42:08.057
I'm grab us some, uh,
guac and chips.

42:11.796 --> 42:14.197
Make sure you
get it right.

42:14.199 --> 42:16.666
With this stain,
I can extrapolate

42:16.668 --> 42:20.003
her ring size
in five minutes.

42:21.907 --> 42:23.907
Just keeping it easy.
