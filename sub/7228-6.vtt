Who's ready
to play some games?

01:03.188 --> 01:04.022
I am!

01:04.105 --> 01:05.815
I'm gonna zoom
on the racetrack!

01:05.899 --> 01:08.610
I'm gonna play
all the games
in the whole arcade!

01:08.693 --> 01:11.738
Welcome to Archie's Arcade,
where the fun never stops.

01:14.699 --> 01:16.743
Now remember,
no one with a wristband

01:16.826 --> 01:18.703
can leave the arcade
without a grownup.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.456
Thanks!

Can my friends
get one, too?

01:25.210 --> 01:27.420
Huh. I don't see why not.

01:28.671 --> 01:30.089

Cool! Thanks.

01:32.175 --> 01:33.301
[laughing]

01:33.885 --> 01:36.679

What should we do first?

01:36.763 --> 01:40.725
Look, Dad! Tossball!
My favorite!

01:40.809 --> 01:42.519
Can I play?
Huh? Can I?

01:42.602 --> 01:44.020
The race car game first.

01:44.103 --> 01:45.980
Okay. Okay, you two.

01:46.064 --> 01:49.150
Donny, I'll take you
to play Tossball.
Awesome!

01:49.234 --> 01:51.694
And Doc, you can be
a race car driver.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.154
Just make sure
I can see you.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.072
Okay, Dad.

01:54.656 --> 01:56.950
You'll need these tokens
to play the games.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.410
Thanks.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.455
Dad, watch me
toss this ball!

02:32.694 --> 02:34.320
I want to play
this one.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.072
I want to play,
too, Doc.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.490
You can help me steer.

02:37.866 --> 02:41.744
Okay, you guys,
start our engine!

how the dragon does it.

Did you guys
hear something?

03:07.061 --> 03:10.607
Yeah. It sounded like someone
calling your name, Doc.

Hmm. It wasn't Dad.

I heard someone

does that mean we can dance?

03:58.905 --> 04:00.698
So I did hear something.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.825

oh, is that really you?

04:18.216 --> 04:20.510
It sure is.
You can call me Doc.

And these are my friends
Stuffy and Lambie.

04:23.638 --> 04:27.642
Whoo! Oh, Doc,
are we happy to see you.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.060
We heard you fix toys,

04:29.143 --> 04:31.312
and my friend Gaby
really needs your help.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.731
Hi, Gaby.
What happened?

04:34.315 --> 04:35.984
A little girl
came to play

04:36.067 --> 04:38.236
and picked me up
with the big grabber.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.738
I almost got
to go home with her,

04:40.822 --> 04:43.950
but the grabber dropped me,
and I ripped.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.828
Now no one ever tries
to pick me up.

04:47.161 --> 04:48.454

I can to help you.

05:42.341 --> 05:44.927
Then some lucky kid
will take you home.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.220
I just know it.

have to play for you.

But, Doc, this game
is really hard.

can't grab Gaby?

Are you okay?

06:43.778 --> 06:44.737
I'm okay.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.365
This game's
harder than it looks.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.784
And I only have
two more tokens.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.088
Oh...
Oh, no.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.798
What're we gonna do now?

07:04.549 --> 07:07.927
I guess I'll just be
a broken tank toy for life.

on you, Gaby.

but I can.

you want to do this?

07:22.066 --> 07:23.568
It might not be easy,

07:23.651 --> 07:26.028
and if you get stuck
in there, well...

07:26.571 --> 07:28.823
I'm not sure
I can get you out.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.950
You help toys
all the time, Doc.

07:31.325 --> 07:33.369
Now it's my turn
to help you.

07:34.954 --> 07:36.038
Can I borrow that?

07:36.330 --> 07:37.165

is going up!

07:53.806 --> 07:55.266
closer to the top
of the tank

07:55.349 --> 07:57.143

and grab her.

08:22.084 --> 08:24.587
I'll get you both
out of there.
I promise.

08:26.506 --> 08:28.466

the last one, Doc?

08:28.966 --> 08:31.761
It is. This time
it has to work.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.099
Stuffy, I'm going to get
the grabber near you.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.894
You need to grab it
and hold onto Gaby.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.647
And no matter what,
don't let go.

08:43.313 --> 08:44.398
Roger that, Doc.

08:45.983 --> 08:46.859
Ready?

08:46.943 --> 08:47.944
Ready!

[Stuffy] Set!

08:54.283 --> 08:55.409
Go!

08:57.453 --> 08:58.663
Got it!

08:58.746 --> 09:00.540
Come on. Come on.
Come on.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.042
[Lambie]
Hold on, Stuffy.
Hold on.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.628

That's it!
Come on!

09:05.711 --> 09:07.672

09:10.424 --> 09:12.718
I'm so proud of you,

09:12.802 --> 09:14.095
That was amazing.

09:14.178 --> 09:15.846

we brave dragons do.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.190
You don't have
to worry anymore, Gaby.

09:26.274 --> 09:27.984
I'm gonna
take care of you.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.695
Let's take a look
at your ouchie.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.365
That's quite a rip,
all right.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.450
And you've lost
some stuffing.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.703
I have a diagnosis.

09:38.786 --> 09:41.330
Gaby, looks like
you have Stuffanemia.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.501

walk again, Doc?

09:45.585 --> 09:46.961
After I fix you,

09:47.295 --> 09:49.630
you'll be the fastest
giraffe in town.

09:50.047 --> 09:53.801
Lambie, I need you
to hold these two threads
out of the way

09:53.884 --> 09:55.886
while I put Gaby's
stuffing back in.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.680
You got it, Doc.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.978
Perfect.
Thanks, Lambie.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.522
Now pull it tight
and tie it closed.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.816
Ooh, not too tight.

10:09.692 --> 10:13.362
There. Now, Stuffy,
press your finger here,

10:13.446 --> 10:15.865
and pull it out
when I tighten the thread.

10:17.575 --> 10:20.161
Nice and tight.
Thanks, guys.

Okay, Gaby,
try standing up.

11:04.038 --> 11:06.207
if you might wanna
come home with us.

11:06.749 --> 11:09.251
[gasps] Did...
Did you really mean it?

11:10.961 --> 11:12.463
Oh, thank you, Doc.

11:12.713 --> 11:15.132
I'm the luckiest stuffed giraffe
in the whole world.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.803
But that means
I have to leave my friends.

11:19.678 --> 11:21.472
Don't you worry
about us, Gaby.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.265
We'll miss you
and all,

11:23.349 --> 11:25.893
but we won't be stuck
in this tank forever.

11:27.686 --> 11:29.897
Bye. I love you guys.

11:30.731 --> 11:31.690
Bye.

11:33.401 --> 11:34.527
[Donny] Doc!

11:35.736 --> 11:37.571
Hey, Doc!
Look what I won!

11:37.655 --> 11:40.116
Wow! Cool bouncy ball.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.993
Hey, did you win
that giraffe?

11:43.077 --> 11:45.830
Sure did.
There's a bunch of cool toys

11:45.913 --> 11:47.289
over in the tank game.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.958
Ooh! I see them!

11:49.041 --> 11:50.668
Come on!
Let's go play it!

11:50.751 --> 11:54.713
Well, kids, I think
we've all had enough
excitement for one day.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.257
Let's go.

11:58.592 --> 12:00.094
Wow!
Look what I won.

12:00.177 --> 12:02.096
Cool!
I want to try, too.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.226
[Dad] Come on, Doc.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.478
Wait for me!

12:15.860 --> 12:17.778
[Doc reading]

12:29.165 --> 12:31.876
This is gonna be awesome!

12:31.959 --> 12:34.628
I know. Lambie
and Stuffy and I

12:34.712 --> 12:36.088
have perfect seats.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.591
And in honor
of the meteors,

12:39.175 --> 12:41.510
we have frozen
star-shaped fruit pops,

12:41.594 --> 12:45.306
star cookies,
and star-shaped apple slices.

12:47.391 --> 12:50.352
Mmm! Startastic, Dad.

12:50.436 --> 12:51.520
Dad, look!

12:51.896 --> 12:54.690
I'm shining
my flashlight on Mars!

12:54.773 --> 12:56.567
Greetings, Martians.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.611
Anyone up there
want a star cookie?

12:58.986 --> 13:00.029
[laughing]

13:00.112 --> 13:03.574
Mom, I'm gonna set up
my new telescope
on the back patio.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.577
Whoa! A telescope?

13:07.036 --> 13:09.413
Dad, can I go over
to Henry's to see it?

13:09.497 --> 13:12.541
Sure. But don't
be gone too long.

13:12.625 --> 13:15.628
The meteor shower is supposed
to start in about 20 minutes.

13:16.212 --> 13:17.379
Hi, Henry.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.507
Hi, Doc.
Come look at this.

13:19.590 --> 13:20.424
Wow!

13:20.758 --> 13:22.426
What a great telescope.

13:22.760 --> 13:26.931
I just got it.
Can't wait to use it
to watch the meteor shower.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.599
We just have
to put it together.

13:32.853 --> 13:34.730
Now I'm gonna
check out the moon.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.817
What do you see? A star?
Maybe-- maybe two stars?

13:38.901 --> 13:40.402
A whole galaxy?

13:40.486 --> 13:42.238
Everything
is all blurry.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.822
I can't see
anything.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.032
Let me try.

13:47.201 --> 13:50.037
You're right.
It's all fuzzy.

13:50.120 --> 13:52.623
But the meteor shower
is gonna start soon.

13:52.706 --> 13:55.501
I got my telescope
so I could
see it up close.

13:55.918 --> 13:58.212
You know, I'm really good
at fixing toys.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.757
Maybe I can fix it
before the meteor
shower starts.

14:01.840 --> 14:03.592
Okay. You can try.

14:05.719 --> 14:08.222
If you want,
come over to our yard

14:08.305 --> 14:10.182
for our star picnic.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.934
Mom, is it okay

14:12.017 --> 14:14.353
if I watch the meteor shower
at Doc's house?

14:14.436 --> 14:15.938
[Mom] Sure, honey.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.024
[gasps]
Who goes there?

14:19.441 --> 14:21.485
It's me... and Henry.

14:21.569 --> 14:24.154
Dad, I'm gonna try to fix
Henry's telescope.

14:24.238 --> 14:25.322
I'll be right back.

14:25.739 --> 14:28.075
Okay, honey.
Henry, help yourself

14:28.158 --> 14:30.578
to some
startastic treats.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.092
The Doc is in.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.310
[giggling]

14:55.227 --> 14:56.604
Hi, Doc!
Hi, Doc!

14:56.687 --> 14:57.646
Hi.

14:57.730 --> 15:00.357
Everyone,
this is our new patient.

15:01.150 --> 15:03.944
Far out! I'm Aurora.

15:04.028 --> 15:07.656
Wow! Totally cool place
you got here.

15:08.240 --> 15:10.492
It's got a really
groovy vibe,

15:10.910 --> 15:13.913
and I love
the big-screen TV
you have.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.248
It's a fish tank.
Aah!

15:16.332 --> 15:19.585
So what's this groovy
place all about?

15:19.668 --> 15:20.753
It's where-- Ooh!

15:20.836 --> 15:22.713
This is Doc McStuffins' clinic

15:22.796 --> 15:24.506
for stuffed animals
and toys.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.718
Well, I dig it,
but I can't stay long.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.511
Tonight's the big
meteor shower.

15:29.595 --> 15:31.889
It's gonna be
totally cosmic.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.433
Huh?
Did she say "shower"?

15:34.516 --> 15:36.685
No one told me
it was gonna rain!

15:37.311 --> 15:41.523
[chuckles] Chilly,
you can't get wet
from a meteor shower.

15:41.982 --> 15:43.734
Meteors are
the streaks of light

15:43.817 --> 15:46.070
made by little rocks
flying through space.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.406
Flying rocks?
Ooh, that's worse!

15:49.490 --> 15:52.576
[chuckles] Well,
I'd better boogie.

15:52.993 --> 15:53.827
Peace.

15:53.911 --> 15:54.870
Ooh!
Hey!

15:57.498 --> 16:02.169
Oh! Whoa. I was totally sure
that was the door.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.088
Oh, here it is.

16:04.713 --> 16:05.547
Ow.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.758
Aurora, I'm not sure

16:07.841 --> 16:10.010
you're seeing things clearly
through your lens.

16:10.552 --> 16:13.555
Why? My lens
is crystal-clear.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.433
Look at the groovy
little doggy.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.103
[gasps]
Oh, poochie.

16:19.186 --> 16:21.730
I am definitely
not a dog.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.232
Three kisses.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.484
Oh, I see.

16:25.567 --> 16:28.362
Or maybe I don't.

16:29.238 --> 16:30.114
Bummer.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.034
I wonder
if there really is
something wrong.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.453
Nothing the Doc
can't fix, I'm sure.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.580
Let's do
a quick checkup.

17:07.233 --> 17:09.778
A checkup
sounds way cool.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.780
I'm gonna do an eye exam.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.949
I mean, a lens exam.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.577
I'll try to see
what you can see.

17:18.328 --> 17:21.205
Now follow the light.

17:23.125 --> 17:24.251
Looks good.

17:24.334 --> 17:26.377
Stuffy, can you get
the eye chart?

17:26.795 --> 17:27.755
You betcha.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.676
[grunting]

17:33.093 --> 17:34.803
Ta-da.
Whoa! Wowwee!

17:35.304 --> 17:37.097
Uh, a little help here.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.769
[chuckles] I'm good.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.688
Okay, Aurora.
Can you tell me

17:44.772 --> 17:46.523
what pictures
you see on here?

17:46.607 --> 17:48.275
Ooh,
that's a pretzel.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.736
The twisted kind,
obviously.

17:51.487 --> 17:52.863
That's a banana.

17:52.946 --> 17:54.865
This is totally fun.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.035
How about this one?
It's-- It's hard.

17:58.535 --> 17:59.495
No, it's not.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.997
It's a far-out flower.

18:02.498 --> 18:03.373
How'd I do?

18:04.666 --> 18:07.586
Let's try another test.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.964
I want to check how far away
you can see things.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.929
Stuffy, will you go stand
away from Aurora?

18:17.387 --> 18:18.222
You got it.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.517
Just tell me when to--
Whaah!

18:22.434 --> 18:23.560
Stopping now.

18:23.644 --> 18:26.522
Good. [laughs]
Now stand right there.

18:27.189 --> 18:29.942
Okay, Aurora,
just walk toward Stuffy.

18:30.025 --> 18:31.151
He's right
in front of you.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.779
Tell me when you can
see him clearly.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.824
Oh... not yet.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.409
Almost.

18:40.661 --> 18:42.079
Right on.

18:42.579 --> 18:45.499
I can see this porcupine
just fine.

18:46.875 --> 18:48.585
I have a diagnosis!

18:48.961 --> 18:51.839
This looks like a case
of blurry-star-itis.

18:52.214 --> 18:56.051
Ooh, this is one for
<span style="style.default_1">The Big Book of Boo-boos.</span>

18:57.094 --> 18:59.513
Blurry-star-itis.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.391
This is what a star
looks like to us,

19:02.474 --> 19:04.143
and this...

19:05.853 --> 19:07.729
is what it looks like
to Aurora.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.649
Oh, that does look
all blurry.

19:11.024 --> 19:12.484
Lay it on me, Doc.

19:12.901 --> 19:15.237
Will I ever be able
to see clearly?

19:15.320 --> 19:17.739
Sure. There are
all kinds of ways

19:17.823 --> 19:19.867
a doctor can help you
see better.

19:19.950 --> 19:22.077
For kids and hippos,

19:22.161 --> 19:24.371
we give them glasses
to help them see.

19:24.746 --> 19:27.207
That's right.
I can't see a thing
without them,

19:27.291 --> 19:29.626
kinda like I can't
see a thing right now.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.504
Well, that's better.

19:32.963 --> 19:36.300
I know. Maybe you're
missing something, too,

19:36.758 --> 19:39.261
something that helped you
see better.

19:41.638 --> 19:43.891
I think
I see the problem.

19:44.391 --> 19:45.475
I don't.

19:45.851 --> 19:48.437
But you will when we find
this missing eyepiece.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.522
It's what helps you
see clearly.

19:50.606 --> 19:51.982
And you don't have it.

19:52.065 --> 19:53.358
Bummer, Doc.

19:53.442 --> 19:55.485
It's almost time
for the shower.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.154
So where do we look?

19:58.155 --> 20:00.699
It's not here.
Maybe it fell out

20:00.782 --> 20:02.618
when Henry was
putting you together.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.952
Road trip!

20:06.163 --> 20:08.123
Did you fix
my telescope yet?

20:08.207 --> 20:10.334
Not yet,
but I'm almost done.

20:10.417 --> 20:13.295
Dad, I'm gonna run over
to Henry's real quick.

20:13.378 --> 20:15.005
I left something
over there.

20:15.088 --> 20:17.216
Okay. Ooh,
take Donny's flashlight.

20:17.299 --> 20:19.092
And hurry,
the meteor shower

20:19.176 --> 20:21.094
should be starting
in about five minutes.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.936
Everybody spread out.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.688
That eyepiece has got
to be here somewhere.

20:32.272 --> 20:34.900
Oh, it's dark out there.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.402
Maybe I ought
to stay in the wagon,

20:37.486 --> 20:40.030
just to protect it,
not because I'm... [chuckles]

20:40.113 --> 20:41.907
scared of the dark or anything.

20:41.990 --> 20:44.743
Not to worry, Chilly.
Just stick with me.

20:44.826 --> 20:46.536
I'm a big, brave dragon.

20:46.620 --> 20:49.164
So I'm not scared
of anything. Aah!

20:49.790 --> 20:54.628
It's me.
You know, cute, cuddly,
not-at-all-scary me.

20:55.003 --> 20:55.921
[gulp]

20:56.004 --> 20:57.589
Who said I was scared?

20:57.673 --> 21:00.342
It's okay, Stuffy.
You can stick with me.

21:00.884 --> 21:02.594
We can be scared
together.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.184
Look! There it is!

21:09.268 --> 21:11.103
Way to go!
Yes! She found it!

21:11.186 --> 21:14.106
Come on. We have to get
this eyepiece on Aurora

21:14.189 --> 21:15.691
before the shower starts.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.318
Right on, Doc!

21:21.738 --> 21:26.201
[Aurora] Oh, Hallie,
those glasses are so groovy.

21:26.618 --> 21:28.704
Why, thank you,
sugar.

21:28.787 --> 21:32.499
[gasps] Wait!
You can see!

21:32.916 --> 21:37.170
I really can.
This is deep, really deep.

21:37.587 --> 21:41.216
And the moon and the stars.
Totally cosmic!

21:41.633 --> 21:42.759
Take a look.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.887
[Doc]
Wow. It's so close

21:45.971 --> 21:47.472
I can almost touch it.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.391
Hey, that's a rocket!

21:49.474 --> 21:50.892
Hey,
there goes a comet!

21:50.976 --> 21:53.687
[all]
Whoo hoo! Looks like
a party on the moon!

22:34.394 --> 22:36.730
I never knew how beautiful
everything was

22:36.813 --> 22:38.899
until you helped me
see clearly.

22:39.316 --> 22:40.567
Thank you, Doc.

22:41.151 --> 22:45.906
Thanks to all of you.
You're all really groovy.

22:46.281 --> 22:47.574
[Dad] Better hurry,
pumpkin.

22:47.657 --> 22:50.077
Coming!
Let's go, everybody!

22:50.160 --> 22:52.370
We don't want to miss
the meteor shower.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.290
[grunts] Whaah!

22:55.665 --> 22:56.833
Ohh... whaah!

22:57.334 --> 22:59.503
You're just in time.
It's about to start.

22:59.961 --> 23:01.296
Did you fix it?

23:01.379 --> 23:02.339
Take a look.

23:04.925 --> 23:07.886
Hey, what's my mom
doing on the moon?

23:09.137 --> 23:12.349
You might want to point
the telescope that way.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.812
The meteor shower!
It's happening!

23:16.895 --> 23:18.105
Want to look?

23:19.815 --> 23:21.108
Far out.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.027
What did you say?

23:24.361 --> 23:27.322
I mean...
it's so amazing.

23:27.739 --> 23:28.573
[giggles]

23:29.116 --> 23:31.034
It sure is.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.830
Hey, everybody.
It's Doc here.

23:35.205 --> 23:37.290
<span style="style.default_1">Luca got a splinter</span>
<span style="style.default_1">in his finger.</span>

23:37.374 --> 23:39.835
<span style="style.default_1">What should you do</span>
<span style="style.default_1">if you get a splinter?</span>

23:40.669 --> 23:43.922
<span style="style.default_1">Should you play dragon stomp</span>
<span style="style.default_1">and knock down all your blocks?</span>

23:46.299 --> 23:49.261
<span style="style.default_1">Should you tell an adult</span>
<span style="style.default_1">so they can remove the splinter?</span>

23:50.303 --> 23:53.557
<span style="style.default_1">Should you play a game</span>
<span style="style.default_1">of throw cotton balls</span>
<span style="style.default_1">at Stuffy's tummy?</span>

23:55.267 --> 23:58.353
<span style="style.default_1">That's right: get an adult</span>
<span style="style.default_1">to remove the splinter.</span>
