01:04.200 --> 01:08.033
Him and I were the last two left
out of the original...

01:08.120 --> 01:10.554
And when you were shelled,
how did you feel?

01:11.080 --> 01:12.832
I don't know. I just...

01:13.000 --> 01:16.754
After Norman got hurt... Killed, why...

01:17.040 --> 01:18.837
I was all right when we were moving up,

01:18.920 --> 01:20.433
or attacked, or anything like that,

01:20.520 --> 01:21.509
but when we'd get pinned down,

01:21.600 --> 01:24.068
I'd start thinking about him
laying back there.

01:24.160 --> 01:27.550
I believe that your profession
is calling it nostalgia.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.595
- In other words, homesickness.
- Yes, sir.

01:30.840 --> 01:34.594
It was induced when,
shortly before the war,

01:34.880 --> 01:37.713
I received a picture of my sweetheart.

01:37.960 --> 01:39.109
Yes?

01:49.200 --> 01:50.758
I'm sorry. I can't continue.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.319
That's all right.

01:53.080 --> 01:56.197
Well, when I was in combat, Mindanao...

01:56.280 --> 01:57.269
Can you speak louder?

01:57.360 --> 01:59.555
- I have trouble hearing you.
- Yes, sir.

02:00.360 --> 02:01.952
During that time...

02:02.760 --> 02:05.797
I got word that my brother,

02:06.480 --> 02:09.392
he was killed at Guadalcanal.

02:10.080 --> 02:11.149
What is your name?

02:11.240 --> 02:13.231
Ivan Bibic, sir.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.552
You feeling okay, Ivan?

02:15.640 --> 02:16.675
Yeah.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.794
What are you thinking about right now?

02:21.440 --> 02:23.396
Home, sir.

02:23.480 --> 02:25.232
Going home.

04:16.920 --> 04:20.196
So, how many medals did they give you?

04:20.279 --> 04:21.599
Just one.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.437
I thought your chest
would be all covered with them.

04:29.840 --> 04:32.149
Did you kill all the Japs, or leave some?

04:32.320 --> 04:34.629
- We got most of them.
- Good.

04:40.560 --> 04:41.834
Of course...

04:43.080 --> 04:46.356
If I'd been there,
it wouldn't have taken so long.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.560
I heard they had you in one of their camps.

05:06.120 --> 05:07.758
Why didn't you get away?

05:15.600 --> 05:17.511
Was it rough?

05:21.440 --> 05:23.908
Well, thank God you survived.

05:25.160 --> 05:28.152
You were gone so long
I was afraid you were dead.

05:28.600 --> 05:31.239
I thought I'd have to make
some new babies.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.076
I saved your old Harley for you.

05:37.240 --> 05:38.673
- No.
- Yeah.

05:39.560 --> 05:42.438
It's under a tarp in the back of the barn.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.194
Maria?

06:31.760 --> 06:33.034
Maria?

07:35.720 --> 07:38.075
But you don't understand the movie, Al.

07:38.360 --> 07:41.796
She died because she needed his love.
Do you know what I mean?

07:41.880 --> 07:44.269
Al, please don't. Don't go too far.

07:44.360 --> 07:46.191
Baby, just let me put my hand there.

07:46.280 --> 07:47.633
Al.

07:48.200 --> 07:51.510
- Come on, why not?
- Please. Yes. No!

07:51.600 --> 07:53.272
Baby, I know what you want.

07:53.480 --> 07:54.879
Al, just listen.

07:55.080 --> 07:56.672
Could you love me like that?

07:56.760 --> 07:58.273
Like what?

07:58.720 --> 08:00.517
Like the movie.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.912
Through life and all the way into death.

08:03.000 --> 08:05.036
Of course. Of course, baby.

08:05.320 --> 08:07.595
Why do you even ask me that?

08:08.240 --> 08:10.595
Now, come on. Just this once.

08:10.760 --> 08:12.113
Oh, please, no.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.992
Jesus Christ! What the...

08:15.720 --> 08:17.312
I'm sorry.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.909
Maria, it's...

08:21.600 --> 08:23.238
Do you remember me?

08:25.040 --> 08:26.712
I don't believe it!

08:31.520 --> 08:35.195
Al, this is my friend Ivan Stuska.

08:35.280 --> 08:37.635
I mean, Bibic.

08:37.960 --> 08:39.951
Ivan, this is Colonel Al Griselli.

08:40.039 --> 08:41.871
- Captain.
- Captain.

08:42.480 --> 08:44.198
Hi, how you doing?

08:49.960 --> 08:51.234
I guess I'd better be going.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.753
Yeah, we'll see you around. Take care.

08:52.840 --> 08:55.070
No. You go, too.

08:59.560 --> 09:03.075
Well, good night, everybody!

09:20.840 --> 09:21.989
Good night.

09:22.440 --> 09:23.839
Ivan!

09:26.560 --> 09:28.516
I can't believe it's you.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.552
Al, you know,

09:34.520 --> 09:38.433
when I came with my mother
from Yugoslavia when I was little,

09:38.920 --> 09:42.071
Ivan was the very, very first person
I met, you know.

09:44.360 --> 09:47.238
You can't believe what
wonderful times we used to have.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.638
Good to have you back.

09:50.760 --> 09:52.910
So, this was your guy before the war, huh?

09:53.280 --> 09:54.508
No.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.517
No, it was a long time ago.

09:56.600 --> 09:59.717
Oh, yeah. I was just a girl, you know.

10:00.440 --> 10:02.749
- Real little.
- She's some dish now, huh?

10:07.600 --> 10:09.238
Think I better go.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.999
Carry on.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.597
Will we see you soon?

10:39.120 --> 10:41.190
So, you saw Maria.

10:44.440 --> 10:45.509
So?

10:46.200 --> 10:48.430
She's fine. She's okay.

10:48.520 --> 10:49.999
She's got a boyfriend.

10:50.080 --> 10:51.911
He's a big cheese, a captain.

10:53.280 --> 10:56.158
Like I always told you,
she's too good for you.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.358
Like her mother.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.511
Oh, my God.

11:04.240 --> 11:06.390
What eyes her mother had.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.439
Like they could turn you inside out

11:09.520 --> 11:12.318
and pick out the good from the bad.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.153
You know,

11:15.920 --> 11:18.718
every time I looked into those eyes

11:20.000 --> 11:21.911
I felt pain.

11:24.640 --> 11:28.633
Like she could see everything lousy
I'd ever done in my life.

11:31.920 --> 11:35.515
It's... To remember girls like that...

11:37.520 --> 11:38.839
To Maria.

11:46.960 --> 11:50.714
Now, that's what I call
a real woman. Mrs. Wynic.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.279
Mrs. Wynic! Come in.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.160
Meet the greatest hero
of the Second World War.

11:58.240 --> 12:01.038
Oh, my God!

12:06.400 --> 12:09.198
I heard you were home.
I couldn't wait another minute.

12:09.280 --> 12:11.396
Look at this face!

12:11.600 --> 12:12.953
How about a drink?

12:16.160 --> 12:18.196
Oh, no!

12:18.280 --> 12:20.271
I meant to bring goodies.

12:20.360 --> 12:23.352
I have cakes and fresh wild raspberries,

12:23.440 --> 12:26.113
but I was so excited!

12:26.200 --> 12:29.397
I just rushed right over. Oh, God!

12:29.480 --> 12:32.358
I'll be back. Oh, God.

12:34.680 --> 12:37.831
Ivan, why don't you come home with me

12:37.920 --> 12:40.275
and help me bring over
some special treats?

12:40.360 --> 12:41.349
That's okay.

12:41.440 --> 12:42.634
No, no, go.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.280
Oh, no, you darling boy!

12:45.840 --> 12:48.229
Now, listen, you tell me what he was like.

12:48.320 --> 12:49.469
- Who?
- Tell me the truth.

12:49.560 --> 12:52.632
General MacArthur. Was he a nice man?

12:52.720 --> 12:55.917
I'm so excited! I can't believe you're here.

12:56.440 --> 12:57.793
Come here.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.912
This is a nice house.

13:31.360 --> 13:32.554
Thank you.

13:36.640 --> 13:38.039
Can I help you?

13:46.440 --> 13:50.115
They tell me
the oriental women are different.

13:50.520 --> 13:52.192
You know what I mean?

13:54.480 --> 13:58.155
Oh, no. Oh, don't tell me!

13:58.240 --> 14:00.435
You'll make me blush.

14:01.720 --> 14:03.711
You're such a man now.

14:06.360 --> 14:07.998
A hero.

14:09.160 --> 14:11.435
- Sorry.
- Oh, my God.

14:13.800 --> 14:15.233
I'm sorry.

14:22.640 --> 14:24.471
I'm helpless.

14:29.880 --> 14:31.711
The oriental women,

14:32.360 --> 14:34.430
they were so small, so...

14:34.520 --> 14:35.999
Oh, no.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.356
Unhealthy.

14:38.920 --> 14:39.989
No!

14:40.080 --> 14:44.471
Soldier, do you like to dance?

14:44.560 --> 14:47.518
Oh, my God! I mean...

14:47.600 --> 14:49.511
What are you doing?

14:50.160 --> 14:51.832
Want to dance?

14:53.080 --> 14:55.548
- Boogie, boogie, boogie!
- Oh, God.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.598
- I haven't danced in so long.
- Oh, God!

14:59.720 --> 15:03.872
I was lonely. Watch your hair!

15:27.640 --> 15:30.438
A penny for your thoughts.

15:37.240 --> 15:39.959
You seem far away.

15:40.960 --> 15:42.598
Mmm-hmm.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.674
I love a mystery.

15:51.080 --> 15:52.672
What is it?

15:58.480 --> 16:01.153
Do you know the sound
of a head being cut off?

16:03.200 --> 16:04.349
It's just a snap.

16:04.440 --> 16:06.908
Just a snap. Like you break a match.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.678
That's what the Japs use to do
if they caught you

16:08.760 --> 16:11.399
trying something in the camp. No warning.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.951
One night it was raining.

16:16.200 --> 16:20.034
Rained all the time. It was like having
a kettle boiling in the room.

16:21.160 --> 16:23.116
It was so wet you'd pick your finger...

16:23.200 --> 16:26.988
Pick your mold off between your fingers.

16:33.080 --> 16:35.071
I heard this screaming,

16:37.200 --> 16:40.556
and they had a guy pinned down
for maybe 10 seconds,

16:40.880 --> 16:45.032
screaming like it was 100 years. And...

16:46.760 --> 16:49.558
Then, through the air,
the whoosh of the sword.

16:51.000 --> 16:52.638
And then a crack,

16:53.680 --> 16:56.513
and a muffled plop like...

16:58.440 --> 17:02.592
Like a ripe melon falling in the mud.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.511
And then nothing but the rain.

17:11.400 --> 17:14.675
I'm lying on my mat in the mud

17:15.200 --> 17:17.760
and I think I hear something.

17:17.839 --> 17:19.955
I look and I see it's a rat.

17:22.520 --> 17:25.432
And I think it's a female, pregnant,

17:27.359 --> 17:30.033
because it's dragging its feet

17:30.240 --> 17:32.708
and leaving a trail of blood.

17:33.600 --> 17:36.353
And then, as it passes me, I see that its...

17:38.880 --> 17:42.236
Its fur has got blood on it.
Just its fur, and its...

17:43.720 --> 17:45.278
Its belly is full,

17:47.360 --> 17:49.078
and it's dragging its feet.

17:50.960 --> 17:53.349
And I know what it had for dinner.

17:54.880 --> 17:56.472
After that, I...

17:57.760 --> 17:59.318
After that, I...

18:01.240 --> 18:03.037
I married Maria.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.512
No, in my mind, see?

18:07.720 --> 18:10.917
Because then I didn't have to...

18:11.640 --> 18:14.108
I didn't have to see it anymore.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.840
And everything I looked at was Maria.

18:18.560 --> 18:20.596
Everywhere I looked.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.716
All day I worked for her,

18:23.040 --> 18:25.270
all night I made love to her.

18:26.160 --> 18:28.071
In your dream.

18:30.080 --> 18:31.991
Yeah, in my dream.

19:50.760 --> 19:54.753
Here he is. A speech from our hero.

20:00.920 --> 20:01.955
I...

20:04.080 --> 20:05.115
I...

20:05.200 --> 20:08.715
"I"? You mean we, my son. We made it.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.031
We made it.

20:16.080 --> 20:17.069
We...

20:18.400 --> 20:20.914
We all went over there.

20:22.160 --> 20:24.833
A lot of guys never...

20:27.920 --> 20:30.354
I guess I was lucky.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.235
To...

20:35.320 --> 20:36.435
Home.

21:22.480 --> 21:24.630
Al, can we dance now?

21:24.760 --> 21:26.239
Do you mind? I'm just getting into this.

21:26.320 --> 21:27.639
Yeah, tell us what happened.

21:27.720 --> 21:31.679
So, then it's like this ball of fire from hell.

21:31.800 --> 21:33.233
It's coming straight towards us,

21:33.320 --> 21:34.355
right out of the sky.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.954
- Joe, will you dance with me?
- No.

21:42.120 --> 21:43.519
So, where was I?

21:43.600 --> 21:45.636
- Ball of fire from...
- Yeah, right.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.033
Like a lightning bolt!

21:51.320 --> 21:53.470
All four engines in flames.

21:54.360 --> 21:56.191
Have I told you this one?

21:56.640 --> 21:59.552
- Do you want to dance?
- No, I want to hear this.

22:03.480 --> 22:06.119
- And I said...
- I want to go home. All right.

22:06.200 --> 22:08.794
Do you mind? I am trying to tell this story.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.711
Go on, Al.

22:11.320 --> 22:12.435
So...

22:13.840 --> 22:16.638
I got a hold of the guy, pulled him out.

22:16.720 --> 22:19.632
The son of a bitch up and dies on me.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.953
Al, won't you dance with me just once?

22:33.520 --> 22:34.839
Sure.

22:36.280 --> 22:37.633
Hold that.

22:44.520 --> 22:46.238
I guess I'll stretch.

23:02.560 --> 23:03.834
Oops!

23:04.200 --> 23:07.069
I was so...

23:07.640 --> 23:09.039
You know.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.277
This is great. This is really great.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.718
This is really something.

23:15.800 --> 23:18.234
- Oh, yeah?
- Thank you, Harry.

23:18.680 --> 23:20.352
I hate this party.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.953
I hate everyone at this party.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.119
- Me?
- Especially you.

23:32.040 --> 23:33.917
Take me out of here.

23:43.080 --> 23:44.069
Get your hands off me!

23:44.160 --> 23:46.754
You two get the hell out
and stay out.

24:09.720 --> 24:11.597
Do you remember this place?

24:12.080 --> 24:13.638
Of course.

24:13.720 --> 24:16.359
But I never came here without you.

24:16.720 --> 24:18.631
Yeah, it's a long way.

24:18.880 --> 24:19.915
What?

24:20.000 --> 24:21.831
I said it's a long way.

24:30.240 --> 24:32.879
Hey, look, our chair's still here.

24:33.200 --> 24:34.428
See?

24:34.680 --> 24:37.319
I always said this was a magic place.

24:38.040 --> 24:40.031
I just want to see something.

24:40.800 --> 24:41.994
Come on.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.799
What are you doing?

24:54.640 --> 24:56.358
Just wait a second.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.633
Wait a second.

24:59.920 --> 25:01.035
Okay.

25:02.440 --> 25:04.431
Okay, now.

25:06.280 --> 25:07.713
Let me do this right.

25:07.800 --> 25:10.314
Do you remember before I left for the war?

25:11.960 --> 25:13.359
Do you remember?

25:19.640 --> 25:20.755
Please.

25:21.280 --> 25:24.431
I asked you to come here and meet me.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.068
I'm sorry.

25:28.880 --> 25:29.995
Well...

25:31.920 --> 25:33.717
Would you open it now?

25:40.120 --> 25:41.599
Oh, Ivan!

25:43.200 --> 25:45.031
Oh, they're beautiful.

25:46.360 --> 25:48.237
How precious.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.719
Don't look.

26:25.040 --> 26:27.713
It's over. The season.

26:28.040 --> 26:30.110
For berries, I mean, you know.

26:30.320 --> 26:32.197
So I only got these.

26:38.920 --> 26:40.433
You're different.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.071
Before you were the same.

26:45.240 --> 26:47.196
But now you're different.

26:48.760 --> 26:50.716
I'm older, you know.

26:52.520 --> 26:53.999
Same eyes.

26:55.440 --> 26:56.839
Same lips.

26:57.280 --> 26:58.474
That's mine.

26:59.440 --> 27:00.793
Same freckles.

27:06.640 --> 27:08.119
Say more.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.072
You know,

27:30.280 --> 27:32.589
I think I've loved you all my life.

27:34.440 --> 27:36.032
I just never realized it.

27:36.120 --> 27:37.712
- When did you?
- Now.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.674
Just now.

27:55.440 --> 27:59.228
I bet when you were over there
you never even thought about me, huh?

28:05.280 --> 28:06.998
Let's go home.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.672
Al will kill me.

28:53.000 --> 28:55.230
- Hi, Al.
- Okay, that's it.

28:55.320 --> 28:56.514
You, get out of here.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.909
- Al, what do you think you...
- Get... Hey!

28:59.000 --> 29:01.673
Don't get on your high horse
with me, baby, you understand?

29:01.760 --> 29:04.797
- I want to know who the heck you think...
- Al, come on, please. Just talk to me later.

29:04.880 --> 29:05.949
We've been out all night...

29:06.040 --> 29:08.190
You're damn right
you've been out all night.

29:08.280 --> 29:10.111
- I want to talk to you.
- So talk.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.474
You and me.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.278
Ivan is my oldest friend, all right.

29:14.360 --> 29:17.591
So, if you have something to say to me,
say it in front of him.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.518
We're getting married.

29:24.720 --> 29:26.438
But you never asked me.

29:27.240 --> 29:29.310
I never asked you?

29:30.360 --> 29:32.157
You stay out all night

29:32.240 --> 29:35.550
with this so-called friend of yours, right?

29:35.640 --> 29:37.119
Was I engaged to you?

29:37.720 --> 29:40.075
No, I guess you weren't.

29:40.200 --> 29:42.509
I guess I just made a big mistake.

29:43.000 --> 29:44.479
- Al...
- You don't want to marry me?

29:44.560 --> 29:46.755
Well, fine. Good.

29:47.320 --> 29:50.517
Damn you, baby.
And damn you, too, clown.

29:51.720 --> 29:53.119
Al, wait!

29:58.120 --> 29:59.109
Al!

30:02.760 --> 30:03.875
My car!

30:03.960 --> 30:06.269
Hey, you son of a bitch, you hit my car!

30:32.720 --> 30:34.312
Anybody home?

30:39.840 --> 30:41.592
Remind you of anything?

30:44.480 --> 30:46.198
I made one just like that

30:46.840 --> 30:48.273
for your mother.

30:51.440 --> 30:55.149
Of course, better wood
before the war, but still...

30:56.000 --> 30:58.468
And it's so beautiful.

30:58.880 --> 30:59.949
Thank you.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.071
I still have a good hand.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.197
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.032
It's okay.

31:14.280 --> 31:15.395
Well...

31:17.960 --> 31:20.679
Just a second. I'll be about through.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.671
Just about through.

31:47.160 --> 31:48.957
- Hello.
- Just a second.

31:50.680 --> 31:51.954
Hello!

31:54.560 --> 31:56.471
How are you?

32:00.760 --> 32:02.796
She's deaf as a post.

32:06.520 --> 32:07.669
Come on.

32:09.040 --> 32:11.713
Come over here. Relax.

32:20.120 --> 32:21.758
You're a good girl.

32:22.160 --> 32:23.832
You keep the house nice,

32:23.920 --> 32:26.229
you know, you take care of your babushka,

32:27.320 --> 32:29.754
but it's too much for you.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.872
You need a good man.

32:33.880 --> 32:34.915
Yeah.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.476
I was thinking that myself.

32:39.560 --> 32:41.676
You ready to marry, then?

32:42.720 --> 32:46.998
Some strong, healthy man
from a good family

32:47.080 --> 32:48.911
with nothing to be ashamed of?

32:50.160 --> 32:53.152
Established, not poor.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.231
I want to marry Ivan.

32:59.960 --> 33:00.995
Ivan?

33:01.720 --> 33:03.631
My son Ivan?

33:06.320 --> 33:07.958
You're too good for him.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.348
Well, at least I'll have grandchildren.

33:21.680 --> 33:23.352
Let me kiss you.

33:25.480 --> 33:28.119
Listen, I'm almost your father.

33:34.160 --> 33:37.516
Fathers don't need to ask
their daughters for a kiss.

33:55.280 --> 33:57.236
It's just that once.

33:57.880 --> 33:59.916
Before you become my daughter.

34:03.440 --> 34:06.159
Oh, my God, those eyes.

34:33.480 --> 34:35.038
Be exalted like unto Abraham,

34:35.120 --> 34:37.031
O bridegroom, and be blessed like Isaac

34:37.120 --> 34:40.635
and multiply like Jacob, walking in peace

34:40.719 --> 34:44.838
and keeping God's commandments
in righteousness.

35:26.080 --> 35:27.911
How many children we'll have?

35:30.120 --> 35:31.269
One?

35:33.680 --> 35:34.908
Two?

35:35.640 --> 35:37.676
Three, four, five?

35:38.000 --> 35:39.752
- Come here.
- Six, five?

35:39.960 --> 35:41.154
Come here.

35:52.440 --> 35:55.193
My train!

36:01.560 --> 36:03.152
I'll be right out.

36:14.760 --> 36:16.079
Come.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.753
Love you.

36:43.080 --> 36:44.798
What are you doing?

36:45.640 --> 36:47.517
I want to look at you.

36:56.080 --> 36:58.913
- No, don't. Don't.
- Yes.

36:59.640 --> 37:02.473
I'm your husband. I want to.

37:14.160 --> 37:15.878
You're so beautiful.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.636
Just relax, my beautiful.

37:19.280 --> 37:20.759
Just let me.

37:21.160 --> 37:23.799
Please, don't be scared.

37:23.880 --> 37:26.917
I love you, every inch of you.

37:27.720 --> 37:31.633
Please, my darling, just relax.

37:32.520 --> 37:34.112
Just relax.

37:34.840 --> 37:37.308
Let me kiss you.

37:40.080 --> 37:42.913
Look at me. Look at me.

37:47.520 --> 37:49.078
I'm not scared.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.235
I'm not scared.

37:51.320 --> 37:53.880
Come, my love. Come into me.

37:54.600 --> 37:57.478
Come, come, come!

37:58.640 --> 38:00.039
Come, come.

38:03.480 --> 38:04.959
I want your baby.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.230
I want your baby right away.

38:08.880 --> 38:10.108
Right away.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.272
I want your baby.

38:18.560 --> 38:19.959
I want you.

38:20.240 --> 38:21.275
I want you.

38:21.360 --> 38:24.272
I want your baby.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.758
I don't get it.

38:49.520 --> 38:52.637
I'm so happy to be with you,
but I just can't.

38:58.560 --> 38:59.879
Is it...

39:02.080 --> 39:05.117
- Am I making you...
- Oh, no.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.238
I must have. I mean, I know.

39:07.320 --> 39:09.880
I know you, you know...

39:10.320 --> 39:12.834
With other women and stuff, I know that.

39:13.840 --> 39:15.159
Listen,

39:15.640 --> 39:18.871
I love you so much,
my whole body falls apart.

39:37.240 --> 39:39.071
Could you love me less?

39:41.680 --> 39:43.989
I don't want to love you less.

39:44.480 --> 39:45.913
I don't want to.

40:26.520 --> 40:27.953
It's true.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.472
You really can see it.

40:32.360 --> 40:33.554
You can?

40:33.640 --> 40:34.993
Absolutely.

40:43.800 --> 40:44.835
Well?

40:47.400 --> 40:48.719
What was it like?

40:49.360 --> 40:50.873
Wonderful.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.839
Was there blood?

40:55.480 --> 40:56.515
No?

41:32.240 --> 41:33.559
Come on, Dave.

41:44.480 --> 41:46.152
Get that dog out of here.

41:47.840 --> 41:48.989
Ain't no dog.

41:49.520 --> 41:51.636
What's that animal look like to you?

41:55.960 --> 41:57.154
A pig.

42:05.560 --> 42:07.755
I can triple your business in a week.

42:09.400 --> 42:10.879
No joke, pal.

42:11.720 --> 42:13.517
I did it in Chestertown.

42:14.280 --> 42:15.633
I can do it here.

42:16.520 --> 42:18.431
How come you left Chestertown?

42:18.800 --> 42:20.153
Family problems.

42:21.200 --> 42:24.829
Look, nobody brings in the ladies like me.

42:25.520 --> 42:27.636
I got the face of Robert Taylor,

42:28.240 --> 42:29.992
the voice of Sinatra.

42:30.440 --> 42:32.237
I got other tricks, too.

42:35.880 --> 42:37.757
Bet you a quarter on this one.

42:51.920 --> 42:54.309
Put salt on your peanuts.

42:55.080 --> 42:58.675
You'll have them drinkin' like
the ground after a summer drought.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.155
So...

43:02.480 --> 43:03.879
I got the job?

43:05.760 --> 43:06.795
No.

43:07.320 --> 43:08.878
Yeah, well...

43:09.520 --> 43:11.511
Got a club date in Philly, anyway.

43:13.040 --> 43:14.473
Come on, Dave.

43:32.880 --> 43:34.438
See you later, girls.

43:34.720 --> 43:36.039
Bye, Harry.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.149
Bye, Harry.

43:44.080 --> 43:46.310
You know, in some ways,
I'm sorry the war is over.

43:46.400 --> 43:49.437
They look so swell in their uniforms.

43:51.200 --> 43:52.792
Especially Al.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.355
Would you look at that!

44:47.360 --> 44:49.112
No, no, no.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.192
Never from you, cutie pie.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.630
So, any requests?

44:55.280 --> 44:56.998
Do you know Makin' Whoopie?

45:45.160 --> 45:47.196
Mister, you can't do this.

45:56.360 --> 45:58.157
You know, she's a nice girl,

45:58.240 --> 45:59.593
and this is a rotten thing to do.

45:59.680 --> 46:01.636
- Maria!
- Maria!

46:02.680 --> 46:04.989
Name's Clarence Butts, cutie pie.

46:05.160 --> 46:06.798
No if's, and's, or's.

46:12.640 --> 46:14.551
I'm just passing through,

46:15.400 --> 46:17.436
but I'll be back for you.

46:36.000 --> 46:37.035
Maria!

46:39.000 --> 46:40.638
Hi, Rosie.

46:41.480 --> 46:42.754
Watch it there.

46:43.120 --> 46:45.554
Maria, come here.
I gotta tell you something.

46:45.640 --> 46:47.915
You won't believe it. You won't believe it.

46:48.000 --> 46:49.752
We're gonna get married!

46:50.360 --> 46:51.998
- That's wonderful.
- Isn't it?

46:52.080 --> 46:54.310
- We need to drink to it. Have a beer.
- Yeah, take a beer.

46:54.400 --> 46:56.709
- Ivan, isn't that great?
- Sure.

46:56.880 --> 46:58.108
Maria...

46:59.040 --> 47:00.234
Chocolates.

47:00.320 --> 47:02.231
- Did you smell my new perfume?
- Maria, take the chocolates.

47:02.320 --> 47:03.594
It's from France.

47:03.680 --> 47:05.432
- Take the chocolates. Come on, the best.
- Take 'em.

47:05.520 --> 47:06.555
Thanks.

47:06.720 --> 47:08.676
Maria, you look so happy.

47:08.760 --> 47:10.239
I'm glad you're happy.

47:10.320 --> 47:12.629
I'm so happy. You're so happy.

47:12.720 --> 47:15.518
Everybody's happy.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.278
A party, engagement party.

47:22.360 --> 47:24.635
- Tell you about it tomorrow. Okay.
- See you guys around.

47:24.720 --> 47:25.755
All right.

47:26.760 --> 47:28.955
We're gonna live in Detroit!

47:29.440 --> 47:30.555
Detroit!

47:56.000 --> 47:58.116
Do you sleep, my darling?

48:19.160 --> 48:20.878
Thanks, Harry.

48:26.640 --> 48:28.312
Exhibit A, my friend.

48:29.840 --> 48:31.637
Salty as the deep blue sea.

48:33.080 --> 48:34.593
Oh, yeah.

48:35.400 --> 48:36.515
Thanks, pal.

48:36.640 --> 48:38.073
Still got the guitar.

48:38.280 --> 48:40.635
Bring the ladies in. You won't regret it.

48:40.960 --> 48:43.349
The guys pay to get them
all drunk and mushy.

48:43.440 --> 48:46.557
My music gets them hot and bothered
and ready for the kill.

48:55.000 --> 48:56.274
Not bad, Harry.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.833
I don't know.

49:05.000 --> 49:06.513
You play for tips?

49:08.440 --> 49:10.351
Okay, okay, I'll give it a try.

49:10.720 --> 49:13.598
- Get him a drink, Harry.
- Whiskey, up.

49:19.160 --> 49:20.388
Stay there.

49:22.840 --> 49:24.239
Hey, one condition.

49:24.320 --> 49:25.912
You gotta get rid of that dog.

49:26.040 --> 49:27.792
That look like a dog to you?

49:31.960 --> 49:34.633
Well, to employment.

49:39.160 --> 49:40.434
Talk to me later.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.477
The name is Clarence Butts.

49:47.560 --> 49:49.437
No if's, and's, or's.

50:08.760 --> 50:11.638
Dave, time for you to give these up.

50:12.080 --> 50:13.559
They already helped you score.

50:13.640 --> 50:14.868
Here, take these.

50:15.160 --> 50:16.434
Thanks.

50:17.200 --> 50:19.919
Go out and get laid. Takes the edge off.

50:43.280 --> 50:44.952
I can't make love to her.

50:52.280 --> 50:54.032
I can't make love to her.

51:21.640 --> 51:24.108
You dreamed about her too long.

51:26.920 --> 51:29.480
She lives in your dreams,

51:30.040 --> 51:31.871
not in your body.

52:27.040 --> 52:28.917
I've been thinking, Ivan.

52:31.080 --> 52:32.752
I've been thinking...

52:35.360 --> 52:38.796
I've been thinking
that it has to be my fault.

52:41.280 --> 52:44.238
If you don't love me, I won't hold you.

52:45.040 --> 52:48.077
I would rather lose you
than destroy you, Ivan.

52:51.600 --> 52:53.511
I know you don't love me.

52:53.840 --> 52:55.273
And I don't care.

52:58.320 --> 53:00.038
I love you, Maria.

53:06.280 --> 53:07.998
You love me?

53:35.040 --> 53:36.996
I'm so glad.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.671
I'm so happy.

53:40.040 --> 53:42.031
I wasn't sure, you know?

53:45.440 --> 53:47.431
You don't feel well.

53:47.680 --> 53:49.272
You poor thing.

53:49.880 --> 53:52.713
- Oh, Maria...
- "I love you. " Yes, I know.

53:52.800 --> 53:55.633
I know, my love, I know.

53:55.840 --> 54:00.038
I feel so much better, you know.
So much better. I've been worried.

54:00.240 --> 54:02.629
I've been so worried all this time.

54:03.360 --> 54:04.509
I'm so glad.

54:05.520 --> 54:07.192
Let's just show how much
we love each other

54:07.280 --> 54:09.191
and go to bed, huh?

54:09.920 --> 54:11.478
My true love.

54:12.760 --> 54:15.035
Here I am, it's your wifey.

54:16.040 --> 54:19.032
Just waiting, waiting for you.

54:20.200 --> 54:21.599
Come on, let's go!

54:22.720 --> 54:25.109
My poochie, what's the matter?

54:29.400 --> 54:31.152
You drink too much, huh?

54:32.040 --> 54:33.758
You stay up too late?

54:34.720 --> 54:36.915
You love me too much, maybe?

54:40.320 --> 54:41.992
Is that it?

54:42.800 --> 54:44.791
- Please.
- "Oh, please. "

54:45.160 --> 54:46.798
"Oh, please. "

54:48.640 --> 54:50.312
You love me?

54:50.960 --> 54:52.598
You love me?

54:53.160 --> 54:54.991
So make love to me.

55:00.600 --> 55:03.637
I know you can do it because I saw you.

55:03.960 --> 55:07.430
I saw you with that filthy whore.

55:07.680 --> 55:10.831
- Oh, Christ.
- Oh, yeah, you were doing it just fine.

55:11.560 --> 55:14.028
Why were you spying on me?

55:14.960 --> 55:16.473
Don't you dare.

55:16.560 --> 55:18.835
Don't I dare?

55:19.120 --> 55:20.678
Don't I?

55:21.240 --> 55:22.992
You're crazy!

55:23.320 --> 55:25.515
Are you crazy?

55:30.240 --> 55:32.276
Put it down, Maria.

55:34.320 --> 55:35.355
Okay.

55:37.200 --> 55:38.235
Fine.

55:41.120 --> 55:42.599
Cut it off.

55:45.240 --> 55:46.912
That's what you want.

55:47.680 --> 55:51.514
Okay! Come on! Come on!

55:51.760 --> 55:53.716
- Stop it!
- Come on.

55:53.800 --> 55:57.588
- Do it! Do it!
- Stop it! Stop!

55:58.760 --> 56:02.230
You're disgusting. Oh, my God!

56:02.760 --> 56:05.558
Come on. Do it!

56:34.080 --> 56:36.833
I didn't even know if I was a man anymore.

57:08.440 --> 57:09.714
Ivan.

57:10.480 --> 57:13.199
Ivan. Ivan.

57:20.600 --> 57:22.192
Oh, boy.

57:46.960 --> 57:48.757
Wait downstairs, will you?

57:51.880 --> 57:53.279
Sure.

58:44.440 --> 58:47.477
Here they are, the happy couple!

58:50.520 --> 58:53.398
Throw your coats down. Come right in. Hi!

59:00.760 --> 59:03.991
Maria, this is my Uncle Pavel,
this is my Aunt Martina,

59:04.080 --> 59:06.071
and this is Sal.

59:12.800 --> 59:14.199
You're late, pal.

59:14.280 --> 59:16.032
Stayed in bed too long.

59:16.520 --> 59:18.192
She'll be waiting.

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.073
Remember me?

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.310
Don't you want to be with your husband?

01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.958
No, I want to be with you.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.234
Okay. Hold it!

01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:31.671
No, could I please... Could I please...

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.350
No, no, please. Everyone,

01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.710
I can hardly say what I have to say.

01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.992
- I can't be engaged to Rosie.
- What?

01:00:43.440 --> 01:00:45.317
It's the wrong thing.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:47.955
What's this all about, Al?

01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.679
Please, forgive me, Rosie.

01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:53.151
I love Maria.

01:00:57.240 --> 01:00:58.275
Rosie.

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.638
- You let that son of a bitch talk about her?
- Shut up, Father.

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.395
- You ought to tear him limb from limb.
- Shut up, Father!

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.109
Let's go.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:16.631
Hey, they're gonna kill each other!

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:19.234
- Oh, no. Oh, no.
- They're gonna kill each other!

01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.912
Take it easy, now.

01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:22.992
Everything's fine.

01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.833
I'm sorry. That's the way it is.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.831
But we can't help...

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.958
"But we can't help"?

01:01:45.040 --> 01:01:46.075
"We"?

01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:50.675
Okay.

01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.960
Did you hear me? I said okay.

01:01:57.560 --> 01:01:59.278
I said okay, sir.

01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.515
Take her.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.155
- Take her!
- I'm leaving.

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.231
I'm flying out of here in a week.

01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.749
What do you think, fly boy?

01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.230
Do you think I don't have eyes?

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.029
Do you think I didn't see that in there?

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:23.355
I saw.

01:02:24.360 --> 01:02:25.554
I saw.

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:28.318
So just do it.

01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.234
Just do it.

01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:32.078
Go get her.

01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:34.955
Get her dresses, get her stockings.

01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:38.312
Get all her little doodads, her perfume

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.072
and her goddamn little underwear

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.469
and get the hell out of my life.

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:44.912
I really feel sorry for you.

01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:46.839
What do you mean by that?

01:02:46.920 --> 01:02:48.512
Because you don't know what you got.

01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:51.319
- I don't know what I...
- You don't love her.

01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:53.319
You listen to me.

01:02:54.880 --> 01:02:56.108
I love her.

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.556
I'll show you how much I love her.

01:03:23.040 --> 01:03:24.234
Ivan?

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:26.118
Where is Ivan?

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.474
He's gone.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:33.591
Maria, please. Maria, he's crazy.

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.591
Please, come with me to Detroit.

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:36.999
Please, I beg you.

01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.036
- I can't.
- Why not?

01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.439
Forgive me. I don't love you.

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:50.588
I'm sorry.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.910
You should have gone with him.

01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:15.396
You know, when I came back home,

01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:20.189
I think everything went backwards.

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.555
It wasn't what I thought.

01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:25.995
I...

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.195
I really hurt you.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.115
I should've died in the war.

01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:05.239
- Vera, look!
- Hey!

01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:18.631
Hi. Do you remember me?

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.592
You got married.

01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:28.075
It doesn't seem to have hurt you any.

01:07:28.520 --> 01:07:29.953
Do you remember me?

01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.552
Better than I'd like to.

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:35.278
Hard to get, huh?

01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:40.031
You remember me, all right.
Nobody sings like me.

01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:55.069
You come to bed with me,
I'll make your husband look like a warthog.

01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:58.755
Feel that?

01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.798
Not bad, huh?

01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.716
You make me hungry.

01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:11.230
You're like a flower stalk,
but you won't break.

01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.113
Just bend,

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.920
flow with me like water.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.557
Wind through the flowers.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.077
- My husband.
- I don't care.

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.750
Next thing I know,
she's moved away, she's become a model

01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:54.159
and dyed her hair blonde.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:56.913
Can't you get anything
straight, knucklehead?

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.189
I told you to move those gut drums
over here, not hose the floor.

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.236
You been here three days already.

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:05.358
What do you got, bullshit for brains?

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.919
You don't really have to yell like that.

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.194
You shut up.

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.589
If your uncle didn't own this place,
I'd fire your ass.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.875
My uncle does own this place.

01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:15.908
Just you fly right, or you can hit the road.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.949
I know guys that'd kill for this job.

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:21.998
Jesus Christ,
why do I put up with this crap?

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:23.115
Hey...

01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:26.713
I wouldn't let that horse's ass
talk to me like that.

01:14:27.480 --> 01:14:29.835
It makes you look like a worm.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.398
Nice place you got here.

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.879
Thank you.

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:01.549
You wanna go out for a drink
or something?

01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:04.439
No, I can't.

01:15:05.080 --> 01:15:08.038
My granny's sick. I can't leave her alone.

01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:13.032
Hope you're feeling better.

01:15:13.880 --> 01:15:16.235
- She's deaf.
- Deaf?

01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:24.799
Where's your husband?

01:15:27.840 --> 01:15:29.273
He's away.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.548
Far away, or visiting-a-friend away?

01:15:35.520 --> 01:15:36.748
Far

01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:38.835
away.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.239
Far away.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.798
Wait here a minute.

01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.238
I wrote this especially for you.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:33.995
I never felt my heart
Until I looked into your eyes

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:40.390
I never dared to dream
Until I looked into your eyes

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:47.711
I never thought the joys oflove
Could touch a gypsy like me

01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:51.231
Once alone and so free

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.993
Now my heart longs for you

01:16:55.480 --> 01:17:00.315
I never felt the sun
Until I looked into your eyes

01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:06.754
I thought the race was won
And then I looked into your eyes

01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:14.070
I never needed anyone to sing
The songs that I sing

01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:20.554
Now the words only ring
If I sing them to you

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:28.669
My love is there in your eyes

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:34.790
My soul is bare in your eyes

01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:41.753
If I could gaze in your eyes ever more

01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:48.639
It's the dream I live for
You can open the door

01:17:50.680 --> 01:17:56.471
I led a life of crime
And then I looked into your eyes

01:17:57.280 --> 01:18:03.150
My heart became a prisoner
When I looked into your eyes

01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:10.199
I fell beneath your gaze
And felt as though my lies had been seen

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:16.879
All my sins became clean
What a fool I ha ve been

01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:25.029
My love is there in your eyes

01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:32.313
My soul is bare in your eyes

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:39.351
If I could gaze in your eyes ever more

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:42.557
It's the dream I live for

01:18:43.080 --> 01:18:48.677
You can open the door to love

01:18:58.680 --> 01:19:00.432
That was really something.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.712
A virgin? Hot diggity dog.

01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:07.310
- Hard to believe.
- Please.

01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.273
What, are you kidding?

01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:12.074
You hardly ever come across
this kind of thing.

01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:14.636
A lot of girls make the claim,

01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.276
but not that many can deliver the goods.

01:19:20.040 --> 01:19:21.109
Look...

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.674
Come with me.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:27.198
I never asked nobody this.

01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:29.358
It's just been me and Dave.

01:19:29.720 --> 01:19:31.472
- Dave?
- My dog.

01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:35.837
Come on. We'll make a great team.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:37.829
I can sing,

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.475
you can wash my socks, whatever.

01:19:41.640 --> 01:19:43.835
You're a class act all the way.

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:46.509
Squeaky clean, no mileage.

01:19:48.920 --> 01:19:50.831
Leave me now.

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.038
Hey, I'm asking you.

01:19:58.320 --> 01:19:59.469
I'm married.

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:01.953
Listen, sweetie,

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:06.509
the guy's too dumb to screw his own wife,
she might as well take off.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.670
Where you off to? Packing?

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:29.551
Guess you want to shed
a few tears, whatever.

01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.635
Sure took it like a trooper, baby.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.068
Hey, in there.

01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:44.909
Hey.

01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.228
Go away.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:49.476
- Don't you want to come with me?
- No.

01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:53.116
What me, Clarence Butts?

01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.558
Go away!

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:02.717
Some kind of woman.

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:08.270
I swear, I ain't never met no kind
of woman who wasn't crazy.

01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:10.315
You hear me?

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:14.631
- You're crazy.
- Get out of here!

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.759
Crazy woman!

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.708
That girl up there's got bats in her belfry.

01:21:44.560 --> 01:21:45.913
You're all crazy!

01:22:16.560 --> 01:22:17.675
Come on, come on!

01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.637
You want the good-conduct medal?

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:21.358
The girls are ready to go!

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.318
Let me just finish this.

01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:32.469
Yeah!

01:22:37.480 --> 01:22:39.232
Hey, Kathy, what are you doing here?

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.675
I thought you wanted me
to drop dead twice?

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.998
What am I supposed to do
on the Fourth of July, sell a flag?

01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.433
Let's just all be friends.

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:48.875
Why don't you be nice to her for once?
It wouldn't kill you.

01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:51.997
Ivan, I want you to meet
my new friend Joanie.

01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:53.957
- She's Kathy's sister.
- Hi.

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:57.231
Hey, Kathy, how come you
never told me you had a sister?

01:22:57.480 --> 01:23:00.278
Well, you were never exactly
interested in my family tree.

01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:02.828
Ivan, come on, let's go.

01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.594
Come on!

01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.870
I hope I'm giving you enough room.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.879
Oh, yeah. I got plenty of room.

01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:26.511
You know, you remind me
of somebody I used to know.

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.195
Let's go.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.112
You're a dead man.

01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:11.633
They both got you.

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:12.994
Come on.

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:19.635
Hello.

01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.033
- I don't want to bother you.
- No.

01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:26.915
No.

01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.317
I just wanted to tell you.

01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:36.149
I can see.

01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:41.830
And my granny died.

01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:45.397
Yeah, well, I'm sorry.

01:25:47.480 --> 01:25:49.710
I just thought you would wanna know.

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.958
I'm having this baby.

01:26:02.840 --> 01:26:04.398
I need...

01:26:05.360 --> 01:26:08.716
I mean, the baby needs a father.

01:26:11.960 --> 01:26:13.552
What do you need? Money?

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.357
It's just...

01:26:18.280 --> 01:26:19.838
He is not...

01:26:22.440 --> 01:26:24.032
I mean, there is nobody.

01:26:26.280 --> 01:26:28.874
Where's your boyfriend? Detroit?

01:26:32.080 --> 01:26:33.274
Let's go home.

01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:35.951
I don't love you anymore.

01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:41.195
I dreamed you up
and I'm through with that.

01:26:41.800 --> 01:26:43.756
I want to keep it that way.

01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.398
Go home, Maria.

01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:51.471
I will wait for you.

01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:55.954
Don't bother.

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:58.079
You hear me?

01:26:58.960 --> 01:27:00.757
I'm not coming back.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.632
Don't wait for me.

01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:05.913
You hear me?

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:10.991
Still stuck on her, huh?

01:27:17.560 --> 01:27:18.595
Miss?

01:27:22.360 --> 01:27:24.476
I thought you might be hungry.

01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:33.512
Is there anything
that I could do to help you?

01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:41.394
No. Thank you.

01:28:14.280 --> 01:28:16.748
I can triple your business in a week.

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.668
No joke, pal.

01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:20.557
Did it in Minnesota, I'll do it here.

01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:23.154
I can't believe it! I can't believe it!

01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:27.074
Hey, come here! Come over here!

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.357
I'll buy you a drink, no problem.

01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.954
Hey, Bob! Bob, can you hear me?

01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.508
Bob, could we have
some food for this guy?

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.238
Bob's deaf!

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.640
You remember? Brownsville?

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:42.879
Where's your dog Dave?

01:28:42.960 --> 01:28:45.269
Dave got married. Moved to Jersey.

01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:52.112
Do you remember?

01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:54.512
You saved my life.

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.912
I almost killed myself.

01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:00.914
Frankly, pal, I've saved a lot of lives.

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.111
Refresh my memory.

01:29:05.800 --> 01:29:07.597
You told me to get laid.

01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:12.440
I was wondering where those got to.

01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:24.989
- This is all just a big joke to you, isn't it?
- Did you say something?

01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:26.115
Yeah.

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.112
I said I don't like watching you.

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:30.475
So don't watch. Pass the salt, somebody.

01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:31.953
Now, what is this?

01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:34.349
You say this guy told you to get laid?

01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:37.152
That's how you think of it, isn't it?
"Get laid"?

01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:38.639
- Harvey.
- No.

01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:41.348
You are sitting here with a very sweet girl.

01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.272
What about the other one?

01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.910
- He means me.
- I don't mean you, no offense. No.

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:50.036
I mean the other one.

01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:52.315
Now, wait a minute. What did I do?

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:56.038
Ivan, the girl who was having the baby.
I saw you.

01:29:56.120 --> 01:29:57.314
No, you got that all wrong.

01:29:57.400 --> 01:29:59.038
No, I don't got nothing wrong!

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.395
I saw you and I saw her.

01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:04.278
That girl was like an angel.
You just threw her away!

01:30:04.960 --> 01:30:07.428
It wasn't my kid.
It was just her tough luck.

01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:11.035
No! I saw her and I heard her talk,
and you're lying.

01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.109
Nope.

01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:22.909
Sorry.

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.831
Ivan, was it your baby?

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:31.194
Jesus! Lie to me, but don't lie to her!

01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:33.077
- You jerk, sit down!
- Damn you!

01:30:33.160 --> 01:30:34.718
All right, all right.

01:30:35.240 --> 01:30:37.879
You want to know about that girl?
I'll tell you.

01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:42.196
We lived together for a year or more.

01:30:43.240 --> 01:30:45.071
Yeah. So what?

01:30:45.680 --> 01:30:47.910
She made me crazy and she's crazy.

01:30:48.000 --> 01:30:51.629
She's not crazy. I know what crazy is.

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:53.194
You sure do.

01:30:54.800 --> 01:30:57.030
You and her, you'd make a good pair.

01:31:02.120 --> 01:31:04.953
Well, thanks for the grub.

01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:14.071
What seems to be the problem?

01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:18.439
I didn't catch the gist of all that.

01:31:18.520 --> 01:31:21.557
Harvey here is all upset
over some crazy broad.

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.834
Some girl trying to pin down Ivan.

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:26.869
Women.

01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:29.435
Tricky.

01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:32.075
Yeah.

01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:35.679
I met this girl...

01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:38.953
Looked like an angel.

01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.996
Eyes like you wouldn't believe.

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:44.276
Skin like a baby's ass.

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:45.993
The whole bit.

01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:50.273
But kind of shy, you know?
Like, always backing off and coming on.

01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:52.278
Tells me she's married.

01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:55.158
I knew I'd stick it to her.

01:31:55.360 --> 01:31:57.351
It's just a question of when, right?

01:31:57.440 --> 01:31:58.555
So, one night

01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:01.311
she practically strips for me.

01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:05.117
Peels off her little silk panties
like she can't wait to get it in her.

01:32:05.200 --> 01:32:06.679
So, I fuck her.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.353
She's a virgin.

01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:12.353
And married!

01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.269
You got that?

01:32:14.800 --> 01:32:16.552
- You're kidding.
- No joke.

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:18.839
Loved it, anyhow.

01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:21.196
Well, they all like it with me, sure.

01:32:21.400 --> 01:32:23.550
The thing is, five minutes later,

01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:25.912
she kicks me out of bed.

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:28.148
You figure it?

01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.319
Really something.

01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:34.069
Crazy up here in the head, you know?

01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.549
Poor bastard that married her
probably couldn't get her to lie down.

01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:40.113
But I did.

01:32:41.080 --> 01:32:42.559
You want to know how?

01:32:44.680 --> 01:32:45.749
Simple.

01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:48.468
Listen.

01:33:02.320 --> 01:33:06.996
I never felt my heart
Until I looked into your eyes

01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:14.356
I never dared to dream
Until I looked into your eyes

01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:20.231
I never thought the joys oflove
Could touch a gypsy like me

01:33:20.320 --> 01:33:23.039
Once alone and so free

01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:27.398
Now my heart longs for you

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:33.232
I never felt the sun
Until I looked into your eyes

01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:40.030
I thought the race was won
And then I looked into your eyes

01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:46.190
I never needed anyone to sing
The songs that I sing

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:52.549
Now the words only ring
If I sing them to you

01:33:54.200 --> 01:34:00.548
My love is there in your eyes

01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:06.272
My soul is bare in your eyes

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:13.432
If I could gaze in your eyes ever more

01:34:13.520 --> 01:34:19.755
It's the dream I live for
You can open the door

01:34:21.680 --> 01:34:25.195
I led a life of crime
And then I looked into your...

01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:54.553
- What are you doing here?
- Waiting for you.

01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.592
How'd you know I was here?

01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:57.715
Maria.

01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:00.831
- Maria?
- Yeah.

01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:05.113
She has a baby now. She's okay.

01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.794
All alone.

01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:10.273
She's waiting for you.

01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:12.715
Shame.

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.428
Want a drink?

01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:32.035
You?

01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:35.633
I'm dying.

01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:49.635
Maria?

01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:05.075
Maria.

01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:14.588
It's me.

01:39:19.800 --> 01:39:21.392
I'm sitting on your bed.

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:37.078
Do you like him?

01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.636
I love him very much.

01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:26.630
I love him very much.

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:42.395
Yeah.

01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:52.756
I'm home, Maria.

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.757
We're making love, Maria.

01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:00.953
We're making our own baby now.

01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:23.112
ARMY PSYCHIA TRIST; What is your name?

01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:24.839
Ivan Bibic, sir.

01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:27.354
What are you thinking about right now?

01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:29.269
Home.

01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:34.194
Going home.
