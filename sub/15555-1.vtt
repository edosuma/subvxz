02:30.883 --> 02:33.177
Une bière, s'il vous plaît.

02:52.697 --> 02:54.490
Merci.

04:38.928 --> 04:40.430
We are closed.

04:40.513 --> 04:42.265
Just a small drink.

04:48.980 --> 04:51.023
The toilets?

05:43.951 --> 05:47.705
A quick drink and then I'll leave.

05:50.708 --> 05:52.627
Why are you rushing off?

05:52.752 --> 05:55.922
- Hmm?
- I said, why are you rushing off?

05:56.005 --> 05:57.715
I don't understand.

05:59.050 --> 06:00.968
The man from Bristol called ya.

06:06.766 --> 06:09.310
- What man?
- The man in the wheelchair.

06:46.013 --> 06:48.433
What were you doing back here?

06:50.017 --> 06:51.436
Lady,

06:51.519 --> 06:55.106
I never walk into a place
I don't know how to walk out of.

06:56.315 --> 06:58.234
Then why would you get into that van?

06:58.317 --> 07:00.695
You know the reason.

08:11.265 --> 08:13.976
Make yourselves at home.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.604
You've come a long way.

08:16.687 --> 08:19.690
- Thanks for coming.
- What's the job?

08:19.816 --> 08:23.569
There's some people
who have something we require.

08:23.694 --> 08:27.115
- And we want you to get it from them.
- It involves shooting?

08:28.241 --> 08:30.785
You must be tired.

08:30.910 --> 08:33.121
We'll tell you more tomorrow.

08:39.751 --> 08:43.923
Seven fat years
and seven lean years.

08:44.006 --> 08:46.843
- That's what it says in the Bible.
- You ever kill anybody?

08:46.926 --> 08:49.470
I hurt somebody's feelings once.

08:56.060 --> 08:57.812
Don't I know you?

08:59.814 --> 09:03.359
I don't think so. I'd remember.

09:10.491 --> 09:12.368
Okay, two-hour shifts.

09:12.493 --> 09:15.204
I'll watch the front,
you guys watch the back.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.042
Merci.

09:31.888 --> 09:33.765
You awake, then?

09:35.600 --> 09:38.144
Hmm?

09:40.688 --> 09:42.565
How we doin'?

09:47.361 --> 09:48.780
Yep.

10:07.006 --> 10:08.925
You labour or management?

10:09.133 --> 10:13.179
If I was management,
I wouldn't have given you a cigarette.

10:14.889 --> 10:18.935
I am the tour guide.
Over there is the Eiffel Tower.

10:19.018 --> 10:21.771
Over here, the Louvre.
Over there, les toilettes.

10:21.896 --> 10:24.232
What do I call you?

10:24.357 --> 10:27.068
- My name is Vincent.
- Sam.

10:30.279 --> 10:34.992
As per the agreement,
your salary will be $5,000 a week

10:35.076 --> 10:37.745
with a minimum
of four weeks' work.

10:37.870 --> 10:40.248
On the successful completion
of the mission,

10:40.415 --> 10:44.252
you will each receive
a bonus of $20,000.

10:45.712 --> 10:49.799
And by the way,
my name is Deirdre.

10:49.882 --> 10:52.844
- The broad outlines of the mission are...
- Who are your principals?

10:52.969 --> 10:54.804
For you,
there's no one but myself.

10:55.012 --> 10:56.931
Huh?

10:57.014 --> 11:00.017
And what can we infer
from your charming Irish lilt?

11:00.143 --> 11:03.229
- Anything you like.
- Where's the equipment?

11:03.354 --> 11:05.898
Tell me what you need, make a list,
and give it to Vincent.

11:05.982 --> 11:09.235
- Some of the equipment's quite technical.
- If it's in Paris, I'll find it.

11:09.318 --> 11:12.822
This is what we're after.

11:12.947 --> 11:16.909
We need to take it intact from several
men who'll be intent on preventing us.

11:17.035 --> 11:19.287
- How many men?
- You American?

11:19.370 --> 11:23.207
I think the group will be between
five and eight. No more than eight.

11:23.374 --> 11:27.920
- You don't know for sure?
- Not now but I will know before the event.

11:28.004 --> 11:31.549
If you don't know,
why say between five and eight?

11:31.632 --> 11:33.551
There's two to three cars.
The group's travellin'.

11:33.634 --> 11:35.011
- They're not in Paris?
- No.

11:35.094 --> 11:36.012
Where are they?

11:36.137 --> 11:38.723
- You'll find out soon enough.
- What's in the case?

11:40.433 --> 11:43.394
Our plan, in broad strokes, is an ambush.

11:43.519 --> 11:46.064
It's to hit the car,
to take them in transit.

11:46.189 --> 11:49.942
- Transit? City? Country?
- Right now, as I said, I don't know.

11:50.026 --> 11:52.403
But we've to move very quickly.

11:52.528 --> 11:56.991
We'll start with this: Ambush
and assault on two to three vehicles,

11:57.075 --> 12:01.788
five to eight men, and our objective
is the safe retrieval of this case.

12:01.871 --> 12:05.583
Tell Vincent
what it is you'll need.

12:05.666 --> 12:10.546
What do we know about them?
Are they French? Who are they?

12:10.630 --> 12:13.966
All you need to know right now
is that they're very unpleasant.

12:14.092 --> 12:18.679
- You've done this kind of thing before?
- You know...

12:18.763 --> 12:19.847
How difficult can it be?

12:19.972 --> 12:22.100
We have no idea
how these men will be armed?

12:22.225 --> 12:24.602
It seems they'll be
very well armed, indeed.

12:24.769 --> 12:26.813
Where are we going and
how are we getting back from there?

12:26.896 --> 12:30.066
It'll be in France, and the group
will disband at the RV point.

12:30.149 --> 12:33.820
- What does she mean?
- After that, we're on our own.

12:33.903 --> 12:36.614
- It's a military term.
- That's right.

12:36.698 --> 12:38.282
Larry, tell Vincent what you'll need.

12:38.366 --> 12:43.287
Something very fast. Audi S-8.
Something that can shove.

12:43.371 --> 12:46.124
I'm going to have it for you
by the afternoon.

12:46.249 --> 12:49.919
I'll also need a nitrous system.
I've got the specs.

12:54.590 --> 12:56.968
What do you use, weapons-wise?

12:57.135 --> 12:59.345
- Hmm? - Weapons.

12:59.429 --> 13:02.515
- I'm a... I'm a weapons man.
- Weapons man.

13:02.598 --> 13:04.517
- Yeah. - Okay.

13:04.642 --> 13:08.646
They tend to settle the argument.
So what do you favour?

13:08.771 --> 13:12.358
Well, you know. It's a toolbox.
You put the tools in for the job.

13:12.483 --> 13:13.651
What?

13:13.735 --> 13:16.863
You know,
I actually favour the old 1911.

13:16.946 --> 13:20.366
.45. Old gun.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.328
It served my country well.
A long time.

13:24.454 --> 13:26.831
Your country!

13:26.956 --> 13:29.000
Not done too well, have you,
last few wars?

13:29.125 --> 13:31.502
Perhaps not, but at least
we don't go around whining about it.

13:34.172 --> 13:34.964
You ex-military?

13:35.048 --> 13:37.050
No, I got my job
through the New York Times.

13:38.634 --> 13:41.929
- Don't let him get you down.
- It don't mean nothin' to me.

13:42.013 --> 13:43.848
I say what I think.

13:43.931 --> 13:46.392
Are you ex-military?

13:46.517 --> 13:48.728
Boys at Hereford?

13:48.853 --> 13:51.522
I'm sorry, but I'd like to go backwards.
The line of retreat is...

13:51.606 --> 13:56.152
She just told you.
We meet back at the RV, disband.

13:56.277 --> 14:00.198
I understand. I'm just trying to get
a vague notion of the opposition.

14:00.323 --> 14:06.037
We're gonna cause some animosity.
How many will be coming after us?

14:06.162 --> 14:09.207
- You worried about your own skin?
- Yeah, I am.

14:09.290 --> 14:11.209
It covers my body.

14:12.627 --> 14:16.005
All your concerns will be addressed
before we leave.

14:16.130 --> 14:18.633
- Electronics and commo.
- Not more than three cars?

14:18.716 --> 14:20.134
That is our information.

14:20.343 --> 14:22.970
- Can you get me a simulator?
- What's a simulator?

14:23.054 --> 14:26.307
Gunpowder. Sound only, no lead.
Sounds like a pistol.

14:26.391 --> 14:27.975
Quite diverting.

14:28.059 --> 14:31.729
Listen, I'm also gonna need
some bigger injection jets.

14:31.813 --> 14:34.482
The Bosch is not gonna do it.
They have to be custom-made.

14:34.565 --> 14:37.568
We going north? We going south?

14:37.652 --> 14:40.905
I'd like some new clothes.

14:40.988 --> 14:43.658
- Vincent will sort you out.
- I'll take care of it.

14:50.540 --> 14:53.710
- So what brought you here?
- A fella that doesn't work so well.

14:55.044 --> 14:57.422
The man in the wheelchair?

14:58.297 --> 14:59.799
How did he get there?

14:59.882 --> 15:04.721
That was in your neck of the woods,
back in the late unpleasantness.

15:16.065 --> 15:17.400
Good reflexes.

15:18.901 --> 15:20.695
Oh, yeah.

15:21.195 --> 15:23.406
They die hard.

15:30.329 --> 15:33.958
- Interrogation.
- What?

15:34.042 --> 15:38.129
- Methods to withstand interrogation.
- You've done that?

15:38.254 --> 15:41.215
We were taught
to hold out indefinitely.

15:43.009 --> 15:46.763
- Nobody can hold out indefinitely.
- Ah, is that so?

15:46.846 --> 15:52.477
Everybody has a limit. I spent
some time in interrogation... once.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.937
- They make it hard on you?
- They don't make it easy.

15:55.271 --> 15:59.358
Yeah, it was unpleasant.
I held out as long as I could.

15:59.442 --> 16:02.153
All the stuff they tried.

16:02.236 --> 16:04.572
You just can't hold out for ever.

16:04.655 --> 16:07.367
- Impossible.
- How'd they finally get to you?

16:07.492 --> 16:10.244
- They gave me a grasshopper.
- What's a grasshopper?

16:10.370 --> 16:14.874
That's two part gin, two part brandy,
one part crème de menthe...

16:14.999 --> 16:17.043
Fuckin' smartass!

16:17.919 --> 16:20.922
- Can you find this place?
- Of course.

16:21.047 --> 16:22.965
I know it.

16:23.091 --> 16:26.094
That's where
they wanna do the exchange.

16:26.219 --> 16:28.054
You're gonna exchange for cash?

16:29.055 --> 16:33.184
- You know these people?
- My people know them.

16:33.309 --> 16:35.561
Your people have done business
with them before?

16:35.645 --> 16:38.481
Or these people
just gave your people a number?

16:49.242 --> 16:51.536
Larry.

16:55.206 --> 16:58.876
Okay. If we're gonna do it,
let's do the goddamn thing right.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.549
- Hey! - I'm busy.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.136
Okay, come on. Let's go.

17:08.261 --> 17:11.763
The answers to your questions
I'll know when I get back.

17:11.848 --> 17:14.976
- I'll go with you.
- Go with them.

17:35.246 --> 17:37.123
Who does this girl work for?

17:37.206 --> 17:41.586
Well, she works for our betters.

17:41.669 --> 17:44.881
It seems that's what
we're meant to know.

17:52.638 --> 17:55.641
Always a waiting game.

17:55.725 --> 17:59.562
- What?
- It's a waiting game.

18:02.065 --> 18:05.360
Hey, wait.
Would you not do that, please?

18:07.445 --> 18:10.531
Bad for the night vision, yeah?

18:16.704 --> 18:18.998
There they are.

19:07.296 --> 19:10.007
- You have the list?
- Yes, I have it.

19:10.133 --> 19:11.843
Give it to me.

19:15.138 --> 19:17.682
Money?

19:18.933 --> 19:21.477
Okay. You follow my lead.

19:21.602 --> 19:23.855
Just make sure you watch my back.

19:28.609 --> 19:30.319
Don't make any sudden moves.

19:30.778 --> 19:34.365
Just because we're buying guns
doesn't mean we didn't bring any.

19:34.449 --> 19:37.744
Don't worry. Everything's fine.

19:40.371 --> 19:42.999
You want to back him up?

19:46.961 --> 19:49.088
What would I profit from your death?

19:49.172 --> 19:52.633
- Well, you'd have the money.
- I have the money already.

19:54.552 --> 19:57.013
I'll watch the back.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.727
- Have you got it all?
- Oui.

20:04.562 --> 20:07.940
- You're sure?
- Ofcourse. Come and see.

20:18.242 --> 20:19.243
There it is!

20:39.222 --> 20:41.682
It's not all here.

20:43.601 --> 20:45.853
- Vincent. - What?

20:49.816 --> 20:52.527
It's not all here.

20:52.610 --> 20:54.445
- C'est tout?
- Ah, non, non, non.

20:54.612 --> 20:58.866
Le patron va contrôler I'argent.
Vous aurez le reste de la marchandise.

20:58.950 --> 21:02.995
Tiens. Il est là dans la voiture,
avec le patron.

21:03.079 --> 21:07.542
He said the rest is in the other car.
The boss wants to check the money.

21:07.625 --> 21:10.837
If he agrees, we have no problem.

21:10.920 --> 21:12.755
Here, take the car keys.

21:12.839 --> 21:15.925
Go on. Take them.

21:19.762 --> 21:21.597
Come on. Come.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.935
Okay, give me...
Give me some of the money.

21:33.109 --> 21:36.112
Give me some of the money!

21:38.072 --> 21:40.366
- Okay.
- You aren't going in there?

21:40.450 --> 21:44.620
- Yeah, I am, and so are you.
- Why am I going in there?

21:44.746 --> 21:48.750
- Why? To protect me.
- There is no protection there.

21:48.833 --> 21:52.336
If it's a come-on, we're fish in a barrel.
Why do they want you in there?

21:52.420 --> 21:54.839
- What are you, crazy?
- You know, you think too hard.

21:54.964 --> 21:58.593
Nobody ever told me that before.
But I wouldn't go in there.

22:00.303 --> 22:03.806
- What is it, Sam?
- I don't like it. Look at it.

22:05.475 --> 22:07.351
Okay, okay.

22:07.477 --> 22:09.854
Okay, let's just do it.
Let's just do it and be done, yeah?

22:10.855 --> 22:12.273
You don't wanna go in there.

22:13.816 --> 22:17.779
- I'm getting paid to go. It's that simple.
- Okay, come on. Let's go.

22:17.862 --> 22:21.491
If anything goes down,
get next to one of those guys.

22:21.574 --> 22:23.743
If there's a sniper,
he'll be afraid to shoot his own guy.

22:23.868 --> 22:25.536
- Let's go!
- All right.

22:47.683 --> 22:49.602
Stop!

22:49.685 --> 22:51.896
Stay where you are.

23:07.745 --> 23:10.373
So, everything's fine.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.344
Shit! I can't see! I can't see!

23:36.357 --> 23:38.276
Have some of this!

23:42.905 --> 23:44.490
Fuckin' arsehole!

23:49.078 --> 23:52.248
Fuckin' have some more, you bastards!

23:53.958 --> 23:55.877
Come on! Come on!

23:57.295 --> 23:59.714
Let's go!

23:59.839 --> 24:04.093
- No! You goddamn...
- Come on! Let's go!

24:17.106 --> 24:19.067
- Is anybody hurt?
- We're fine.

24:21.027 --> 24:25.823
Almost a bit of raspberry jam
back there, yeah?

24:25.907 --> 24:27.825
A bit of raspberry jam back there!

24:31.537 --> 24:35.249
Got the swag, kept the money.
Job well done.

24:35.333 --> 24:37.251
That's a fact. That is a fact.

25:02.735 --> 25:03.861
Slow down. Slow down.

25:05.947 --> 25:08.116
I think I have to stop.

25:37.019 --> 25:37.895
Thank you.

25:49.490 --> 25:51.367
Why did you take this job?

25:53.911 --> 25:55.955
My friend, I need the money.

25:57.081 --> 25:59.459
The money is here.

26:03.755 --> 26:06.924
That's what this is, you know? Money.

26:11.012 --> 26:12.930
Yeah, but who are our employers?

26:15.558 --> 26:17.435
You're right.

26:45.922 --> 26:47.799
Excuse me.

26:47.924 --> 26:50.468
Excuse me, monsieur.

26:59.268 --> 27:01.646
The Russians are bidding for the case.

27:01.729 --> 27:05.775
The case is in Nice.
They're trying to sell it to the Russians.

27:05.858 --> 27:09.153
They're staying at
the Villa Belle Mer in Nice.

27:10.279 --> 27:14.784
- The team isn't ready.
- Whatever the team is, you do it now.

27:14.867 --> 27:17.995
The Russians have decided to bid.
We need to move now.

27:18.121 --> 27:20.164
Excuse me.

27:20.373 --> 27:23.793
I have the information.
We'll be movin' very soon.

27:23.918 --> 27:25.837
It'll definitely
be in the nature of an ambush

27:25.962 --> 27:29.799
somewhere between here and here.

27:29.924 --> 27:34.345
We'll anticipate
a three-car convoy with a backup team.

27:34.429 --> 27:37.974
We will try and stop the target
before they can get away from us.

27:38.099 --> 27:40.059
- What's in the case?
- That information isn't necessary.

27:40.184 --> 27:42.186
Is it heavy? Is it explosive?

27:42.311 --> 27:44.313
Is it chained
to some unlucky bloke's wrist?

27:44.439 --> 27:46.482
- Are we gonna have to chop it off?
- All right.

27:46.566 --> 27:48.776
I don't have to let you know...

27:48.901 --> 27:52.238
Then the price has got to go up.

27:52.363 --> 27:54.198
I'll get you the case,
but the price has gotta go up.

27:54.323 --> 27:57.076
If it's gonna be amateur night,
I want $100,000. I want it up front.

27:57.160 --> 28:01.914
I want it in a bank account. I want
another $100,000 when you get the case.

28:34.197 --> 28:37.116
Okay.

28:38.368 --> 28:42.538
We've got shooters here, shooters here.

28:42.622 --> 28:44.499
I'll tell you an old trick.

28:44.624 --> 28:45.291
Hey.

28:55.009 --> 28:57.678
- What's your problem?
- Draw it again.

28:59.097 --> 29:02.350
Draw it again.
You're the ace field man. Draw it again.

29:02.475 --> 29:06.145
It's a simple diagram.
Just draw it again. Draw what you saw.

29:06.229 --> 29:10.817
Draw it again! Draw it again.

29:13.986 --> 29:17.448
Two shooters.
Car comes through here.

29:17.532 --> 29:19.534
Shooters across from each other,
kill each other dead.

29:19.659 --> 29:22.495
- Oh, my. Where'd you learn that?
- In a regiment.

29:22.620 --> 29:25.123
- What regiment was that?
- The 22nd Special Air Service.

29:25.206 --> 29:27.625
What's the colour
of the boathouse at Hereford?

29:27.709 --> 29:30.336
What's the colour
of the boathouse at Hereford?

29:30.420 --> 29:32.380
- I don't like your attitude.
- What's the colour of the boathouse...

29:32.505 --> 29:34.966
- Fuck off!
- What's... You got the gun. I'm unarmed.

29:35.091 --> 29:38.094
Do something. Go ahead.
Do something. Do something.

29:38.219 --> 29:40.138
Do something.

29:51.274 --> 29:53.818
Tell me about an ambush?
Don't tell me about an ambush!

29:53.901 --> 29:56.946
I ambushed you with a cup of coffee.

30:00.700 --> 30:03.077
You'll get your money
when we get the case.

30:03.161 --> 30:05.955
- The others, too.
- That is what I understood.

30:06.039 --> 30:07.915
Come on.
We've gotten the word. We're movin'.

30:15.298 --> 30:17.216
Put this near the front.

30:18.760 --> 30:22.096
Careful! Careful with that!

30:33.316 --> 30:36.944
So what colour
is the boathouse at Hereford?

30:37.070 --> 30:38.988
How the fuck should I know?

31:01.386 --> 31:03.304
This'll complete your compensation.

31:06.766 --> 31:09.769
Thanks for your time.
Feel free to leave when we're gone.

31:11.437 --> 31:13.314
Do I need to suggest that you forget us?

31:16.401 --> 31:18.695
Because we will not forget.

32:23.509 --> 32:27.013
- Morning.
- I see you're reviewin' our problem.

32:27.096 --> 32:29.724
Well, either you're part of the problem,
part of the solution,

32:29.807 --> 32:32.018
- or you're just part of the landscape.
- Indeed.

32:33.394 --> 32:34.645
What's in the case?

32:35.730 --> 32:38.107
Something we're paying ya for.

32:53.039 --> 32:57.293
- You and the girl are in front of the hotel.
- The name's Deirdre.

32:57.418 --> 33:00.421
Deirdre.
Wait outside the hotel for the target.

33:00.505 --> 33:02.965
He leaves the hotel for the villa,
the villa for the hotel.

33:03.091 --> 33:04.258
He activates his cellphone.

33:04.342 --> 33:06.177
How do you know
he's gonna use his cellphone?

33:06.302 --> 33:09.180
- He'll use a phone.
- How do you know?

33:09.305 --> 33:11.682
- I'm gonna call him on it.
- How do you know he'll have it with him?

33:11.808 --> 33:14.018
He's waitin' for a call.

33:14.143 --> 33:18.398
His people will call him to tell him
the location of the meet.

33:18.523 --> 33:20.400
- Okay? - Okay.

33:20.483 --> 33:23.820
The villa, the hotel, the car,
the stop light, 8 to 10 guys.

33:23.945 --> 33:25.822
How good's their...
How good's their security?

33:25.905 --> 33:28.991
- I can't tell you.
- Well, let's find out. Where are they?

33:29.075 --> 33:30.993
The last report, they were at the hotel.

33:31.119 --> 33:32.995
- The case is at the hotel?
- We presume that it is.

33:33.121 --> 33:35.873
- That's interesting.
- Why don't we do it now?

33:35.957 --> 33:39.335
- It's tempting.
- It's a good plan. Let's stick to the plan.

33:39.460 --> 33:43.131
Everybody wants to go to the party.
Nobody wants to stay and clean up.

33:43.256 --> 33:45.633
- Please.
- The only thing is that the map...

33:45.717 --> 33:48.428
The map is not the territory.

33:49.804 --> 33:51.389
Let's go look at the ground.

33:51.472 --> 33:54.475
Bring some money.
We're gonna do a little shopping.

34:02.817 --> 34:04.610
Listen up.

34:05.737 --> 34:08.656
You're my wife.
Be who you wanna look like.

34:08.739 --> 34:11.909
It's just a game. Just a game.

34:11.993 --> 34:14.829
Man and a woman going for a walk.

34:14.911 --> 34:18.583
Piece of cake.
Relax. Relax, darling.

34:20.251 --> 34:22.170
You look good cleaned up.

34:26.174 --> 34:28.092
Is that the hotel?

34:43.733 --> 34:46.569
Put your arm under mine.
Put your arm under mine.

34:48.446 --> 34:51.699
Why aren't they at the villa?
Why are they down here?

34:51.824 --> 34:53.951
Fun and games?
Pretty girls and beer or what?

35:07.799 --> 35:11.177
Can I help you, sir?

35:11.469 --> 35:13.513
No. We're looking at the menu.

35:19.936 --> 35:21.354
Merci.

35:51.300 --> 35:54.971
Uh, excuse me?
Do you speak English?

35:55.096 --> 35:55.596
A little.

35:55.680 --> 35:58.433
Could you take a picture
of me and my wife?

35:58.558 --> 36:01.269
It's very easy. You press like that.

36:01.394 --> 36:04.772
- Sure.
- Like that. That's it. Focus like that.

36:04.897 --> 36:06.774
Okay?

36:08.192 --> 36:10.153
We're gonna do it over here.

36:13.114 --> 36:16.951
Can you get that palm tree in?
We wanna show we're on the Riviera.

36:18.828 --> 36:21.998
- How many do you want?
- Just snap away.

36:24.000 --> 36:27.420
Very good. Again.

36:27.545 --> 36:30.798
Again. Get the background.

36:32.383 --> 36:35.219
Take a couple of my wife, alone.

36:45.355 --> 36:48.900
Take my luggage up right away.

36:50.526 --> 36:52.445
Thank you.

36:54.113 --> 36:57.867
Can we take one picture of you
with my wife? One picture with you?

36:59.118 --> 36:59.869
That's it.

37:07.710 --> 37:10.088
So?

37:10.213 --> 37:12.423
Well, they're good.

37:12.548 --> 37:14.926
Guy goes for the case,
other guy's protecting the principal.

37:15.093 --> 37:16.969
Nobody panics. They're good.

37:17.095 --> 37:20.515
- So what have we learned?
- Can it be done?

37:20.598 --> 37:23.184
It can be done.
We should have two more men.

37:23.267 --> 37:26.062
- We don't have two more men.
- Go to your handler.

37:26.145 --> 37:28.022
- There is no handler.
- Let me go.

37:28.147 --> 37:30.316
There's no handler.
There's only me.

37:30.400 --> 37:33.486
Listen, you want the case,
we're gonna need some more men.

37:33.611 --> 37:36.781
There's no more help,
there's no more men. Are you afraid?

37:36.906 --> 37:39.283
Of course I'm afraid. You think
I'm reluctant because I'm happy?

37:39.367 --> 37:42.662
We've made a good plan,
and we're gonna stick with it.

37:47.709 --> 37:49.585
What do we do?

37:50.670 --> 37:52.088
We wait.

37:53.005 --> 37:57.760
- So, who are they?
- Our employers.

38:02.974 --> 38:05.184
- Qui est là?
- It's me.

38:06.310 --> 38:08.813
They've gone back to the villa.

38:08.938 --> 38:11.149
- Did they have the case with them?
- They did.

38:11.274 --> 38:13.109
- Did you get the other cars?
- Got 'em.

38:13.234 --> 38:16.029
- And how do they run?
- They'll do fine.

38:19.824 --> 38:21.701
Yeah.

38:23.411 --> 38:25.371
Well, what does that mean?

38:27.790 --> 38:30.043
It would be nice to do something.

38:30.168 --> 38:32.628
We are doing something.
We're sitting here, waiting.

38:41.888 --> 38:44.098
It's not gonna happen today.

38:44.223 --> 38:46.601
The buyers are out of town.

38:46.726 --> 38:49.062
Tomorrow at the earliest.

38:53.191 --> 38:55.401
You know what?
The hell with 'em. Let's go put 'em to bed.

38:55.568 --> 38:58.279
- We've got the report.
- If I take the report, I got nothing else.

38:58.404 --> 39:01.240
I can go see for myself.
They at the villa?

39:01.366 --> 39:04.744
I'm gonna go take one last run
over the route and tuck 'em in.

39:12.043 --> 39:14.128
I'll come with ya.

39:47.704 --> 39:50.164
So how did you get started
in this business?

39:52.709 --> 39:56.170
A wealthy scoundrel
seduced and betrayed me.

39:57.505 --> 39:59.882
Same with me. How 'bout that?

40:01.551 --> 40:04.595
Take out the map. Take out the map.
If anybody looks, we're...

40:20.653 --> 40:22.947
So who are those guys inside?

40:23.072 --> 40:25.783
You tell me.

40:25.867 --> 40:30.413
Ex-military, Northern Sov Block,
somebody or other.

40:30.538 --> 40:34.792
- They need a job. That's my excuse.
- Is it?

40:36.794 --> 40:38.713
Cops.

41:19.587 --> 41:22.256
System activated.

41:24.050 --> 41:26.719
System check.

41:29.263 --> 41:31.391
Repeat system check.

41:37.438 --> 41:40.650
There he is. He's being good.
He's activated his phone.

42:00.753 --> 42:02.839
I'm in position.

42:39.208 --> 42:42.920
- They're passin' me now.
- Target is on the way.

43:25.630 --> 43:28.716
Hell of a time to be workin'.

43:28.800 --> 43:30.718
What do you want for Christmas?

43:30.843 --> 43:33.513
My two front teeth.

43:33.638 --> 43:35.807
May your wish be granted.

44:10.133 --> 44:13.678
Target is 400 metres
from the traffic light.

45:15.156 --> 45:16.657
Come on! Come on!

45:41.849 --> 45:44.227
So far so good.
Target on the right road.

45:48.439 --> 45:50.274
Sam, escort car.

45:50.400 --> 45:53.277
- Four tenths of a click in front of you.
- Got it.

46:22.223 --> 46:25.893
Larry, you should see them in...
four seconds.

46:26.060 --> 46:27.770
Two cars.

46:29.105 --> 46:30.189
I got 'em.

47:12.982 --> 47:16.069
Target has escaped.
I repeat, target has gotten away.

47:58.486 --> 47:59.987
Target heading for Vieux Nice.

49:06.596 --> 49:08.973
Through the market, then straight.

49:17.482 --> 49:19.359
Right at the fork, Maréchal Foch.

49:27.950 --> 49:30.203
Okay, you're in front of him.

49:38.836 --> 49:42.590
- Cut him off at the end of the port.
- Roger that. I got it.

49:46.010 --> 49:47.512
He's coming from the right.

49:48.471 --> 49:49.639
He's yours.

50:49.407 --> 50:51.951
- I'm hit! Take the case!
- Up the other end!

50:52.035 --> 50:54.996
- Get the fucking case!
- Get the car up the other end!

50:55.121 --> 50:56.039
Take this!

50:57.373 --> 50:59.917
Get out of here!
I'll see you at the safe house!

51:04.338 --> 51:07.842
Hey! Get rid of the case!
Get rid of the case!

51:20.605 --> 51:22.357
Arrêtez-vous!

51:22.440 --> 51:25.276
- Where is Gregor?
- Gregor fucked us.

52:49.318 --> 52:51.237
- How is it out there?
- A lot of heat. A lot of heat.

52:51.320 --> 52:53.364
- How you feeling?
- Okay.

52:53.489 --> 52:56.367
- Thanks for before.
- Don't mention it.

52:58.036 --> 53:01.330
Could you clean the paint off this?

53:01.456 --> 53:04.542
- You got a pack of Camels in there?
- No, you smoke too much.

53:19.432 --> 53:21.351
We must get out ofhere.

53:22.602 --> 53:25.146
I'm gonna need your people to help us.

53:25.271 --> 53:28.191
- And I need you to find the case.
- All right, call your guy.

53:28.316 --> 53:30.735
When we bring in the case, he'll help you.

53:30.860 --> 53:33.738
- How can I bring him the case?
- Well, Gregor has it.

53:35.114 --> 53:38.076
- Why?
- I presume to sell it to the Russians.

53:38.159 --> 53:40.661
Why the Russians? Why not you?

53:40.745 --> 53:41.913
If we had the money to buy the case,

53:42.038 --> 53:44.707
we wouldn't have
hired you to steal it, would we?

53:44.916 --> 53:47.543
- Go to your people. Talk to them.
- You want the case?

53:47.627 --> 53:49.545
We find Gregor, we find the case.

53:49.670 --> 53:52.715
- How do we find Gregor?
- How'd you find him in the first place?

53:52.799 --> 53:55.051
I found him
through your friend, the cripple,

53:55.134 --> 53:57.387
who gave me nothin'
but a bunch of fucking lames!

53:57.470 --> 54:01.808
You and Spence
and the whole sorry lot of you!

54:01.933 --> 54:03.810
We can find him through his cellphone.

54:07.730 --> 54:09.816
Can we trace his cellphone?

54:12.944 --> 54:16.155
They can triangulate it,
if we had that equipment.

54:16.239 --> 54:17.824
Who has that equipment?

54:20.493 --> 54:23.913
Who has that equipment?

54:25.373 --> 54:27.250
Tell me.

54:28.418 --> 54:30.294
Who has it?

54:30.378 --> 54:33.297
All right. All right.

54:33.423 --> 54:35.591
Give me the number to his phone.

55:17.425 --> 55:20.345
So, how does the day find you?

55:20.428 --> 55:24.349
How do they say it in French?
En pleine forme.

55:38.154 --> 55:40.531
This was supposed to be
a social occasion.

55:40.656 --> 55:44.285
- Life is uncertain.
- It is indeed.

55:44.410 --> 55:47.413
But, Gregor,
we have so much history together,

55:47.538 --> 55:50.041
I was sure you wouldn't mind.

55:50.166 --> 55:53.753
- Besides, the world these days is so...
- Unsafe?

55:54.962 --> 55:56.047
Exactly.

55:57.590 --> 55:59.967
I'll show you how unsafe it is.

56:22.657 --> 56:25.618
See that little girl down there?

56:30.707 --> 56:34.127
Have you lost your mind?
Why did you do that?

56:34.252 --> 56:36.504
To make a point.

56:39.382 --> 56:42.427
I don't know her,
but I was ready to blow her brains out.

56:42.510 --> 56:46.848
But you,
I don't particularly like you.

56:46.973 --> 56:50.810
Just imagine what I'll do to you if you
try anything. Now give me my money.

57:07.035 --> 57:08.828
Put down the gun.

57:14.083 --> 57:18.087
- I never liked you either, Gregor.
- Where did that come from?

57:21.049 --> 57:22.967
I should have made you strip.

57:23.134 --> 57:25.803
- Now where's my package?
- It's right behind you.

57:55.833 --> 57:57.293
Whoo-hoo!

57:57.377 --> 58:00.129
Clever girl.

58:00.213 --> 58:01.464
You liked it?

58:01.547 --> 58:03.841
My little sun.

58:05.468 --> 58:08.221
You make me so happy.

58:16.562 --> 58:17.980
Is it done?

58:19.607 --> 58:21.484
It's done, Mikhi.

58:21.609 --> 58:25.363
Natacha?

58:25.488 --> 58:28.032
Gregor? Is that you, Gregor?

58:28.157 --> 58:30.118
Much to your disappointment,
no doubt.

58:30.201 --> 58:34.038
It was a mistake.
It should not have happened.

58:34.163 --> 58:37.333
Well, if it happens again,
I'll turn around and sell it to the Irish.

58:37.417 --> 58:40.712
- Don't do that.
- Then don't make me.

58:40.837 --> 58:42.672
My price just went up 300%.

58:44.507 --> 58:48.636
I want the package, Gregor.
What do I have to do to get it?

58:48.761 --> 58:50.680
Just wait for my next phone call.

58:50.763 --> 58:53.224
I'll find a place
where I can tilt the field in my favour.

59:37.518 --> 59:40.271
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.

59:40.396 --> 59:42.607
Could you tell me
how to find a post office?

59:42.732 --> 59:45.985
Do... Do I know you?
I'm sorry. Do I know you?

59:46.110 --> 59:48.404
How did you know I speak English?

59:48.488 --> 59:50.865
You got an English newspaper.

59:51.032 --> 59:52.950
Sorry.

59:53.034 --> 59:55.078
- I'm sorry. I beg your pardon.
- It's all right.

59:55.161 --> 59:57.705
Uh, what do you need
a post office for?

59:57.830 --> 01:00:00.666
'Cause over here,
they use them for different things.

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:01.667
I need your help.

01:00:03.336 --> 01:00:05.213
- I thought you left.
- I did leave.

01:00:05.338 --> 01:00:07.548
- You did leave? You're out?
- That's right.

01:00:07.632 --> 01:00:10.009
Can you help me? I need your help.

01:00:12.011 --> 01:00:13.888
What's the number?

01:00:18.267 --> 01:00:21.145
Yeah, the post office is, uh,
just down to your left.

01:00:21.270 --> 01:00:23.022
- Up on the left? Thanks.
- On the left.

01:00:30.988 --> 01:00:34.826
- A friend of yours?
- We went to high school together.

01:00:34.951 --> 01:00:38.246
Everyone's your brother
until the rent comes due.

01:00:38.329 --> 01:00:39.914
Ain't that the truth!

01:00:40.039 --> 01:00:42.500
Yes. Yes, on the terrace?

01:00:42.917 --> 01:00:44.377
Facing me? I see him.

01:00:44.460 --> 01:00:47.547
Yes, I'll get him. Hang on, please.

01:00:52.010 --> 01:00:53.511
Excuse me, sir. Are you Sam?

01:00:56.472 --> 01:00:57.348
Yeah.

01:00:57.432 --> 01:00:58.891
Telephone for you.

01:01:07.775 --> 01:01:09.694
Yeah, good to see you, too.

01:01:09.777 --> 01:01:12.655
If his position changes, I'll let you know.

01:01:19.328 --> 01:01:21.372
Gregor's in a town called Arles.

01:02:37.448 --> 01:02:39.867
He's at the arena.

01:03:12.275 --> 01:03:15.278
So this is the amphitheatre of Arles

01:03:15.403 --> 01:03:19.407
which was built
at the end of the first century AD.

01:03:19.532 --> 01:03:21.909
It is built with limestone.

01:03:29.417 --> 01:03:30.668
I know those men.

01:04:02.992 --> 01:04:06.037
And you can see
this dominant yellow colour

01:04:06.120 --> 01:04:08.664
which is actually caused
essentially by a lantern.

01:04:08.748 --> 01:04:11.501
We're not sure that the walls
were actually yellow.

01:04:11.584 --> 01:04:13.503
And so, now we will continue

01:04:13.628 --> 01:04:16.255
and visit the Roman baths
down this way.

01:04:29.894 --> 01:04:31.771
Yeah.

01:04:34.273 --> 01:04:38.194
Thank you, gentlemen.
That'll do nicely.

01:04:40.113 --> 01:04:41.989
It's Sergi. I remember you.

01:04:42.115 --> 01:04:44.867
Yes, Gregor, it's me.

01:04:44.951 --> 01:04:48.746
- How have you been?
- Well. These are trying times.

01:04:48.871 --> 01:04:51.958
- I'm sorry about the unfortunate incident.
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:52.125 --> 01:04:55.545
It was excessive.
And more to the point, it was foolish.

01:04:55.628 --> 01:04:58.381
I couldn't agree with you more.

01:04:58.464 --> 01:05:00.800
Mikhi did it without consulting me.

01:05:02.385 --> 01:05:05.138
Yeah, he's turned rogue
and can't be controlled, is that it?

01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:20.862
Excusez-moi.
Je cherche la vieille maison de Van Gogh.

01:05:20.987 --> 01:05:24.073
- I don't... I don't...
- Oh, English.

01:05:24.157 --> 01:05:26.075
Sorry. Such a fool.

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.077
I was looking for Van Gogh's old house.

01:05:28.161 --> 01:05:32.582
So what could have been conducted
in a collegial atmosphere

01:05:32.707 --> 01:05:34.792
is now fucked into a cocked hat.

01:05:34.876 --> 01:05:38.796
- What do you think?
- I think we'll meet your price.

01:05:40.506 --> 01:05:44.635
Yeah. Yes, so let's see it. Let's see it now.

01:05:44.719 --> 01:05:46.137
Where do you have it, in your belt?

01:05:46.304 --> 01:05:48.931
- Let's see it!
- Show me the case first.

01:05:51.225 --> 01:05:54.395
You're great in the locker room,
and your reflexes might die hard,

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.397
but you're weak
when you put your spikes on.

01:05:57.982 --> 01:06:01.986
- Gregor? Are you all right?
- Gregor's fine.

01:06:02.111 --> 01:06:04.781
But I think you're in a wee spot of trouble.

01:06:05.907 --> 01:06:08.701
- Where is it? Where is it?
- I don't have it with me.

01:06:08.785 --> 01:06:09.786
Where?

01:06:09.869 --> 01:06:12.330
I mailed it to myself.
A post-office box in Paris.

01:06:12.455 --> 01:06:13.498
Hilfe!

01:06:13.581 --> 01:06:15.291
Help! He's robbing me!

01:06:54.455 --> 01:06:56.499
Pardon. Pardon.

01:06:56.624 --> 01:06:58.418
Pardon. Avancez!

01:06:58.543 --> 01:06:59.377
Pardon.

01:08:03.858 --> 01:08:04.692
Stop.

01:08:08.446 --> 01:08:11.157
- Where do I know you from?
- Vienna.

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:14.869
Of course. I'm sorry to have to do this.

01:08:14.952 --> 01:08:15.953
Hey!

01:08:34.305 --> 01:08:36.057
- Christ. - Drive.

01:08:58.203 --> 01:09:03.334
Stop! Descends! Vite! Descends!

01:09:20.518 --> 01:09:27.774
- I'm gonna have to take care of this.
- What do you want to do?

01:09:27.859 --> 01:09:31.612
Uh, get to a doctor
or a veterinarian's office.

01:09:31.779 --> 01:09:34.032
I'll just boost what I need.

01:09:37.785 --> 01:09:41.456
- Could you do that?
- Of course. I can do better.

01:09:44.167 --> 01:09:46.419
- How is it?
- I'm leakin'.

01:09:47.795 --> 01:09:49.505
I'm sorry.

01:09:54.176 --> 01:09:56.054
That girl sold us out.

01:10:00.683 --> 01:10:03.561
She sold us out.

01:10:55.154 --> 01:10:58.116
- Ready, Jean-Pierre?
- Everything's ready.

01:11:17.427 --> 01:11:19.429
Get my legs up.

01:11:19.512 --> 01:11:21.431
Careful.

01:11:30.982 --> 01:11:33.192
Are you sure you can do this?

01:11:33.317 --> 01:11:36.904
Yeah. I once removed a guy's appendix
with a grapefruit spoon.

01:11:37.030 --> 01:11:40.283
- Have a drink.
- No booze. No.

01:11:45.997 --> 01:11:51.002
Easy, easy, easy.

01:11:57.008 --> 01:12:00.845
It's just below the surface.

01:12:02.347 --> 01:12:05.516
All right, let's do it.
Just douse it with alcohol.

01:12:08.978 --> 01:12:11.481
Take the gauze and wipe away
as much of the blood as you can.

01:12:11.606 --> 01:12:13.775
Keep it clean so I can see it.

01:12:18.196 --> 01:12:20.114
Yeah. That's it.

01:12:26.954 --> 01:12:29.082
All right.
What we're gonna do is routine.

01:12:29.207 --> 01:12:31.751
I've done this many times before.

01:12:31.876 --> 01:12:34.045
There are no vital organs, arteries.
It's okay.

01:12:34.170 --> 01:12:36.255
You won't kill me.
Just make sure you get the bullet

01:12:36.339 --> 01:12:38.424
- before you pry it out.
- All right.

01:12:38.549 --> 01:12:40.426
Take that scalpel.

01:12:44.931 --> 01:12:46.849
The upper part.

01:12:48.434 --> 01:12:50.436
Over here. Just cut up there.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.438
Just a little cut.

01:13:03.366 --> 01:13:05.243
Okay. Got it.

01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:08.996
Now take the clamp.

01:13:09.122 --> 01:13:11.833
Take the clamp and open up... the hole.

01:13:11.958 --> 01:13:14.544
Just put it in there.

01:13:15.628 --> 01:13:17.547
Put it in there.

01:13:17.630 --> 01:13:19.549
That's it. Put it in. Just...

01:13:19.674 --> 01:13:21.926
Now open it up. Spread it. Spread it.

01:13:22.010 --> 01:13:24.387
Okay. Okay.

01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:27.557
Now get the other...
Get the other clamps and get the bullet.

01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.684
Remember, don't take it out
unless you really got it.

01:13:48.119 --> 01:13:51.497
Do it again. Do it again.
Just try once more.

01:13:57.670 --> 01:14:01.299
I'm sorry.

01:14:03.217 --> 01:14:07.055
When he pulls it out, put the gauze in.
There's gonna be a lot of blood.

01:14:12.810 --> 01:14:14.687
Put the gauze there.

01:14:24.655 --> 01:14:27.033
Fucker sprayed his bullet with Teflon.

01:14:28.326 --> 01:14:32.205
He was trying to stamp me 'paid in full'.

01:14:32.372 --> 01:14:35.166
- Is that why it went through the vest?
- Yeah.

01:14:36.918 --> 01:14:39.671
You think you can stitch me up
on your own?

01:14:41.047 --> 01:14:44.676
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna pass out.

01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:36.811
You gonna kill me?

01:15:36.894 --> 01:15:40.815
No. I'm not gonna kill ya.

01:16:08.384 --> 01:16:10.261
Why would I want to kill ya?

01:16:29.489 --> 01:16:32.450
- I gave you a job.
- I did my job.

01:16:33.618 --> 01:16:35.286
So how'd it go wrong?

01:16:35.370 --> 01:16:37.413
I thought you wanted the case.

01:16:38.623 --> 01:16:40.416
Oh, we'll get the case.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:43.586
We'll get the case, eh, Gregor?

01:16:45.296 --> 01:16:47.215
Don't you worry about the case.

01:16:49.676 --> 01:16:51.803
What I want's an explanation.

01:16:51.928 --> 01:16:54.639
An explanation? For what?

01:16:54.806 --> 01:16:56.766
You bollixed it up.

01:16:56.933 --> 01:16:59.894
- I bollixed it up?
- You hired him.

01:16:59.977 --> 01:17:01.896
Through your fucking contact!

01:17:07.985 --> 01:17:11.656
- You didn't do your homework.
- Why did you have to kill Larry?

01:17:11.739 --> 01:17:13.658
Oh, Larry, is it?

01:17:14.784 --> 01:17:16.661
I was clearing up your mess.

01:17:16.744 --> 01:17:19.664
My mess?
Oh, well, you take over, then.

01:17:19.789 --> 01:17:21.666
- Eh?
- But you can't, can you?

01:17:21.791 --> 01:17:23.960
It's you that's hiding, isn't it, Seamus?

01:17:24.085 --> 01:17:26.462
It's you that can't show your face.

01:17:29.132 --> 01:17:32.593
Who else thinks that?
Who you been talking to?

01:17:32.719 --> 01:17:34.929
Isn't that the reason
why I'm doing this job?

01:17:38.558 --> 01:17:40.435
You're a good girl, Deirdre.

01:17:41.811 --> 01:17:43.730
Do your job, eh?

01:17:57.452 --> 01:17:59.579
He's tough, your Yank.

01:18:00.955 --> 01:18:02.582
You're right about that.

01:18:04.834 --> 01:18:06.085
But who is he?

01:18:07.795 --> 01:18:09.630
That's not important.

01:18:10.631 --> 01:18:13.384
Didn't he work for the CIA?

01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:16.304
He used to.

01:18:17.013 --> 01:18:18.514
Not anymore?

01:18:20.099 --> 01:18:21.768
He's on the run.

01:18:23.269 --> 01:18:24.771
You're sure?

01:18:24.854 --> 01:18:29.817
I know what he can do.
I've seen him.

01:18:29.901 --> 01:18:32.403
Why would he carve himselfup
ifhe were still CIA?

01:18:32.487 --> 01:18:35.114
He makes a call and it's taken care of.

01:18:45.666 --> 01:18:47.669
And you? How are you?

01:18:56.427 --> 01:19:01.933
We need some information.
We need to find some people in Paris.

01:19:02.016 --> 01:19:03.017
Who?

01:19:03.518 --> 01:19:06.229
An Irish man and woman,

01:19:06.312 --> 01:19:08.564
a German, an ex-KGB.

01:19:09.357 --> 01:19:10.441
They're professionals.

01:19:10.566 --> 01:19:12.068
They're in hiding.

01:19:12.735 --> 01:19:15.822
This is really important to you?

01:19:18.032 --> 01:19:20.576
He saved my life.

01:19:23.454 --> 01:19:24.330
Bon.

01:19:26.749 --> 01:19:29.293
I'll find them for you.

01:19:48.062 --> 01:19:50.857
Where's the case?

01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:56.237
It will come tomorrow. I'm sure.

01:19:56.404 --> 01:19:59.949
Well, I'm sure it will, too. Let's go.

01:20:01.034 --> 01:20:03.369
Let's hope so, for your sake, anyway.

01:20:35.026 --> 01:20:37.195
Are you feeling better?

01:20:37.320 --> 01:20:39.530
Yeah, enough to move around. Thanks.

01:20:49.457 --> 01:20:51.334
My hobby.

01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:54.337
One grows old.

01:20:56.089 --> 01:20:57.965
I knew a lot of fellas, friends of mine,

01:20:58.091 --> 01:20:59.967
they just wanted to live to open a bar.

01:21:00.051 --> 01:21:02.512
Had they lived,
would they have done it?

01:21:05.682 --> 01:21:08.851
- Then they were spared their disillusion.
- Yeah, that's right.

01:21:10.895 --> 01:21:13.064
Who were these people?
Friends of yours?

01:21:15.900 --> 01:21:18.986
- I wouldn't hurt a friend.
- Was that my question?

01:21:20.488 --> 01:21:21.823
That's right.

01:21:27.328 --> 01:21:30.707
Well, who are you?

01:21:32.333 --> 01:21:35.837
A fella like you,
trying to make it to retirement.

01:21:35.962 --> 01:21:40.049
At the end of the day, we're likely
to be punished for our kindnesses.

01:21:40.133 --> 01:21:43.177
You don't have to worry about me.
I won't hurt you.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.374
The 47 ronin, do you know it?

01:22:15.376 --> 01:22:20.882
47 samurai whose master
was betrayed and killed by another lord.

01:22:20.965 --> 01:22:24.510
They became ronin, masterless samurai,

01:22:24.635 --> 01:22:26.846
disgraced by another man's treachery.

01:22:28.306 --> 01:22:30.850
For three years they plotted,
pretending to be thieves,

01:22:31.017 --> 01:22:33.728
mercenaries, even madmen.

01:22:33.853 --> 01:22:36.230
That I didn't have time to do.

01:22:36.314 --> 01:22:38.691
And then one night they struck,
slipping into the castle

01:22:38.858 --> 01:22:40.818
of their lord's betrayer, killing him.

01:22:42.278 --> 01:22:44.739
Nice. I like that. My kind of job.

01:22:44.864 --> 01:22:46.824
There's something more.

01:22:48.409 --> 01:22:52.538
All 47 of them committed seppuku,

01:22:52.663 --> 01:22:56.000
ritual suicide,
in the courtyard of the castle.

01:22:56.125 --> 01:22:58.920
Well, that I don't like so much.

01:22:59.045 --> 01:23:02.173
- But you understand it?
- What do you mean, I understand it?

01:23:04.217 --> 01:23:08.888
The warrior code, the delight in the battle.
You understand that, yes?

01:23:10.139 --> 01:23:13.059
But also something more.

01:23:13.142 --> 01:23:15.520
You understand there is something
outside yourself

01:23:15.645 --> 01:23:18.022
that has to be served.

01:23:18.147 --> 01:23:20.400
And when that need is gone,

01:23:20.525 --> 01:23:23.945
when belief has died, what are you?

01:23:24.028 --> 01:23:26.030
A man without a master.

01:23:26.197 --> 01:23:29.033
Right now I'm a man
without a pay cheque.

01:23:29.158 --> 01:23:32.912
The ronin could have hired
themselves to new masters.

01:23:32.995 --> 01:23:35.164
They could have fought
for themselves.

01:23:35.289 --> 01:23:38.292
But they chose honour.
They chose myth.

01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:41.295
They chose wrong.

01:23:49.095 --> 01:23:51.639
Seppu... Seppu... what?

01:23:51.764 --> 01:23:53.975
Yes, seppuku.

01:23:54.058 --> 01:23:56.310
Disembowelment.

01:23:56.436 --> 01:23:59.188
The sword goes in here.

01:24:09.282 --> 01:24:11.325
Are you sure this address is good?

01:24:11.451 --> 01:24:13.369
Jean-Pierre gave it to me.

01:24:46.819 --> 01:24:50.323
Under the bridge by the river...

01:24:50.406 --> 01:24:53.076
How did you know
it was an ambush?

01:24:53.201 --> 01:24:55.661
Whenever there is any doubt,
there is no doubt.

01:24:55.787 --> 01:24:57.663
That's the first thing they teach you.

01:25:01.417 --> 01:25:04.128
Who taught you?

01:25:04.253 --> 01:25:07.423
I don't remember.
That's the second thing they teach you.

01:25:12.595 --> 01:25:14.889
All good things
come to those who wait.

01:25:45.670 --> 01:25:49.298
- Why is Gregor still alive?
- He's taking them to the package.

01:26:13.865 --> 01:26:15.033
How ya doin'?

01:26:22.915 --> 01:26:25.668
What are you...
What are you gonna do to me?

01:26:25.793 --> 01:26:31.049
Let's just be calm for one more moment.
One more moment.

01:26:43.728 --> 01:26:45.813
Why? Why?

01:26:45.897 --> 01:26:47.982
You know why.

01:26:48.066 --> 01:26:50.234
No. You don't wanna do that.

01:26:54.030 --> 01:26:55.031
You can't.

01:26:59.952 --> 01:27:00.620
Get back!

01:27:02.205 --> 01:27:04.207
Get in the fucking car!

01:27:14.133 --> 01:27:15.718
Why didn't you shoot her?

01:28:07.895 --> 01:28:09.647
Take the tunnel, now!

01:28:09.731 --> 01:28:11.733
Oh, Christ!

01:28:14.027 --> 01:28:16.154
Eh, merde!

01:31:24.634 --> 01:31:26.010
Come on! Come on!

01:31:51.119 --> 01:31:53.079
All right, you fuck!

01:35:20.078 --> 01:35:22.455
Where could he be?

01:35:22.538 --> 01:35:26.501
- Where could he be?
- Hmm.

01:35:26.626 --> 01:35:30.088
The Irish and the Russians are looking
for him. So where does he go?

01:35:30.171 --> 01:35:34.008
He goes to the Russians
to make the deal for the case.

01:35:34.133 --> 01:35:37.637
Gregor ain't comin' in unless
he can figure out a safe exchange.

01:35:37.762 --> 01:35:39.931
He knows they'll kill him for the case
rather than pay him for it.

01:35:40.014 --> 01:35:45.395
He's got to work it out soon
before the Irish find him.

01:35:46.729 --> 01:35:48.564
So where does he go?

01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:52.276
You go to what you know.

01:35:55.822 --> 01:35:59.659
He's KGB.
He goes to one of his old safe houses.

01:36:01.119 --> 01:36:03.746
No, they're all blown.

01:36:03.871 --> 01:36:06.249
Where does he go?

01:36:12.005 --> 01:36:15.425
So, you're on the run.
Where do you go?

01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:17.468
Hmm?

01:36:21.597 --> 01:36:26.019
Where's he been? Where's he been?
Where's he been? Where's he been?

01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:40.324
He made the fake case.

01:36:40.450 --> 01:36:42.827
He had the fake case made.

01:36:42.952 --> 01:36:46.414
Gregor. He had it made.

01:36:46.497 --> 01:36:49.083
He had to have had it made.

01:36:50.585 --> 01:36:53.713
In Paris, before we went to Nice.

01:36:53.796 --> 01:36:55.631
He didn't have time to have it made.

01:36:55.715 --> 01:36:57.925
He bought something that looked like it,
then spray-painted it.

01:36:58.009 --> 01:37:00.595
Where did he get the spray?
He never left the room.

01:37:00.678 --> 01:37:02.680
Where did he get the case?

01:37:12.315 --> 01:37:14.567
Excusez-moi, monsieur.

01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:37.715
It's a case for ice skates.

01:37:41.302 --> 01:37:43.221
Why ice skates?

01:37:45.515 --> 01:37:47.517
And why would Gregor
know an ice-skate case?

01:37:49.519 --> 01:37:51.979
He didn't have time to have it made.

01:37:52.146 --> 01:37:56.943
He didn't have time to have it made.
The Russians made it.

01:37:58.903 --> 01:38:01.489
The Russians made it.

01:38:04.617 --> 01:38:06.494
We're following the wrong people.

01:38:06.619 --> 01:38:09.539
We don't have to find Gregor.

01:38:09.664 --> 01:38:12.375
We find the Russians,
they will take us to him.

01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:16.337
You've lived in Paris
a long time. You know the people.

01:38:16.462 --> 01:38:19.507
- I get around.
- You meet the new Russians.

01:38:19.590 --> 01:38:23.511
You know how it is.
Ex-spies. Now it's Mafia.

01:38:24.387 --> 01:38:26.514
Under diplomatic cover.

01:38:28.057 --> 01:38:29.058
KGB?

01:38:29.308 --> 01:38:30.309
Ex-KGB.

01:38:30.727 --> 01:38:35.314
Heavy hitters, gamblers,
lots ofmoney, big cars.

01:38:35.398 --> 01:38:36.816
They live like tsars.
Throw money away.

01:38:36.899 --> 01:38:38.776
Fur hats are expensive.

01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:44.282
- And bodyguards.
- Expensive coats, Dr Zhivago.

01:38:44.365 --> 01:38:47.535
I have a lot of work, no time.

01:38:49.037 --> 01:38:50.663
I understand.

01:38:52.415 --> 01:38:54.125
All right. Let's go.

01:38:55.043 --> 01:38:56.044
Okay.

01:39:03.217 --> 01:39:04.802
It will be fine.

01:39:06.304 --> 01:39:08.181
The guy is gonna reach out.

01:39:08.264 --> 01:39:10.183
Is he any good?

01:39:10.308 --> 01:39:13.186
Jean-Pierre says if it's Russian
and it's in Paris...

01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:27.700
Ifl wanted to find Russians
in Paris this week,

01:39:27.784 --> 01:39:31.954
I'd go to the ice show.

01:40:45.987 --> 01:40:48.114
- Bonsoir, Pierre.
- Bonsoir.

01:40:48.197 --> 01:40:50.116
Je vais payer pour votre soeur.

01:40:50.199 --> 01:40:53.578
Oh, merci beaucoup,
Mademoiselle Kirilova.

01:41:00.084 --> 01:41:04.839
I'll trade you a cigarette for a favour.

01:41:05.381 --> 01:41:07.300
The favour is, steer clear of those guys.

01:41:07.383 --> 01:41:08.885
Who? The Russians?

01:41:15.391 --> 01:41:17.602
They sure throw their money around.

01:41:18.728 --> 01:41:19.812
Bonsoir.

01:41:19.896 --> 01:41:22.106
- Ça va? - Salut.

01:41:25.401 --> 01:41:27.278
- Bonsoir.
- Ah, bonsoir.

01:41:33.826 --> 01:41:38.164
The Russian is seeing Natacha Kirilova,
the star of the ice show.

01:41:38.247 --> 01:41:41.834
He spends every evening in the audience.

01:41:43.086 --> 01:41:44.587
How did you find that out?

01:41:44.671 --> 01:41:47.965
We went to high school together.

01:42:22.208 --> 01:42:24.669
Mikhi, is everything all right?

01:42:25.461 --> 01:42:26.879
Everything is fine.

01:42:28.089 --> 01:42:29.090
Sweet girl.

01:42:31.926 --> 01:42:32.927
Go. Go on.

01:42:51.904 --> 01:42:53.656
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:42:53.740 --> 01:42:57.035
We are veryproud to present...

01:42:57.118 --> 01:43:04.000
...two-time Olympic champion
and three-time World champion...

01:43:04.083 --> 01:43:07.712
...Natacha Kirilova!

01:45:14.005 --> 01:45:15.923
Let's go.

01:45:29.270 --> 01:45:31.397
Wait out here.

01:45:36.361 --> 01:45:38.613
Yes, he is.

01:45:38.696 --> 01:45:40.782
Hello, Mikhi.

01:45:40.907 --> 01:45:44.911
- The meeting is not till later tonight.
- The meeting's now.

01:45:48.289 --> 01:45:49.874
You have the money?

01:45:51.209 --> 01:45:55.129
Well, we were going to go back
to get it before the meet.

01:45:55.213 --> 01:45:56.297
I don't think so.

01:45:57.799 --> 01:45:59.717
You have the money?

01:46:04.138 --> 01:46:07.141
I might have the money.
Where is the case?

01:46:07.225 --> 01:46:11.604
No, you have to do it.
I couldn't live with myself.

01:46:24.575 --> 01:46:26.452
I have the money.

01:46:26.577 --> 01:46:29.080
We conclude this now
and part friends.

01:46:29.163 --> 01:46:30.957
Okay?

01:46:33.835 --> 01:46:34.919
Where is the case?

01:46:47.306 --> 01:46:49.183
I'd like to be paid now.

01:46:54.772 --> 01:46:56.941
No doubt.

01:47:01.696 --> 01:47:03.573
Now tell me the other part.

01:47:05.033 --> 01:47:07.201
The other part?

01:47:07.327 --> 01:47:09.203
I'm leaving.

01:47:09.329 --> 01:47:12.206
I'm taking my fee and I'm leaving.

01:47:13.833 --> 01:47:16.919
I have a person with a rifle in the stadium.

01:47:17.128 --> 01:47:19.964
I've worked with her for years.
She never misses.

01:47:20.089 --> 01:47:23.051
I will call.

01:47:23.176 --> 01:47:25.511
I have to call within 45 seconds

01:47:25.636 --> 01:47:27.722
to say that I'm leaving,

01:47:27.847 --> 01:47:31.017
and then in another 10 minutes
to say that I'm safe.

01:47:32.685 --> 01:47:36.606
Should I be unable to call,
your friend will be shot.

01:47:46.449 --> 01:47:48.326
30 seconds, Mikhi.

01:47:49.744 --> 01:47:52.246
- We need to get inside.
- You can'tpass without badges.

01:47:59.587 --> 01:48:01.422
20 seconds.

01:48:12.100 --> 01:48:13.101
10 seconds.

01:48:42.338 --> 01:48:45.216
There were two of them.

01:48:45.299 --> 01:48:47.010
They were looking for those guys.

01:48:47.093 --> 01:48:49.262
Just a minute, sir!

01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:09.741
I am a Chilean citizen,
as you can see from mypassport.

01:49:09.824 --> 01:49:11.492
Merci.

01:49:49.947 --> 01:49:53.117
- Mama!
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:49:58.956 --> 01:50:00.583
Katchev!

01:50:00.667 --> 01:50:01.834
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

01:50:16.849 --> 01:50:17.850
Stay with him.

01:50:50.717 --> 01:50:53.261
Get out of here.
Get out of here!

01:50:53.386 --> 01:50:56.222
Get out of the car.
Walk away. Walk away!

01:50:56.305 --> 01:50:59.142
Walk away! Go. Go.

01:50:59.225 --> 01:51:02.103
- I will if you will.
- Just go.

01:51:02.186 --> 01:51:04.647
Come with me.
Forget about the case.

01:51:09.068 --> 01:51:11.529
I didn't come for the case.
I came for your boss.

01:51:13.406 --> 01:51:15.950
I came for Seamus. I came for him.

01:51:17.368 --> 01:51:22.290
Just get out of here.
I never left. Don't you see?

01:51:23.666 --> 01:51:26.002
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!

01:51:34.344 --> 01:51:35.678
Get out of the way!

01:51:35.762 --> 01:51:37.096
This way is blocked.

01:52:04.916 --> 01:52:06.793
I can take you in or leave you here.

01:52:08.294 --> 01:52:09.545
There. That's him with the case.

01:52:09.629 --> 01:52:11.756
Sir! Over here, please.

01:52:11.839 --> 01:52:12.590
Wait! Wait!

01:52:20.223 --> 01:52:23.267
There are more back there!

01:53:00.555 --> 01:53:02.432
Stay where you are!
Stay where you are!

01:53:02.515 --> 01:53:06.394
Don't move! Shut your fuckin' mouth up!
Shut your mouth!

01:53:20.408 --> 01:53:22.243
You stupid shite.

01:53:22.410 --> 01:53:25.955
You're a dead man.

01:53:48.478 --> 01:53:50.855
This is the BBC World Service.

01:53:50.980 --> 01:53:53.649
It was announced today,
after almost 30 years

01:53:53.775 --> 01:53:57.153
ofbloody and seemingly intractable
civil conflict in Northern Ireland,

01:53:57.236 --> 01:53:59.155
that a peace agreement
has been reached between

01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:02.492
the predominantly Protestant
government of that British-ruled enclave,

01:54:02.617 --> 01:54:05.161
and the Irish resistance...

01:54:09.957 --> 01:54:13.544
...have told CNN that it was
the apprehension and slaying

01:54:13.670 --> 01:54:18.508
in France of the Irish terrorist Seamus
O'Rourke, byparties still unknown,

01:54:18.591 --> 01:54:20.927
that contributed a stability,
largely allowing

01:54:21.010 --> 01:54:25.014
the negotiations to proceed
to their historic conclusion today.

01:54:25.139 --> 01:54:28.059
O'Rourke had earlier
been denounced by the IRA,

01:54:28.184 --> 01:54:32.271
the military wing ofSinn Fein,
as a rogue breakaway operative.

01:54:34.774 --> 01:54:38.111
Well, then, good knowin' ya.

01:54:48.830 --> 01:54:49.831
Hmm?

01:54:49.914 --> 01:54:53.126
- I'm sorry?
- You said something.

01:54:53.209 --> 01:54:56.713
I said she would not
be coming back here.

01:54:58.881 --> 01:55:03.344
Yeah. She would
not be coming back here, would she?

01:55:09.600 --> 01:55:11.686
I can't even put my hand in my pocket
to pay the bill.

01:55:11.769 --> 01:55:13.938
I'll get it.

01:55:16.441 --> 01:55:18.276
I'll get the next one.

01:55:24.615 --> 01:55:26.367
What was in the case?

01:55:26.576 --> 01:55:28.619
I don't remember.

01:55:29.954 --> 01:55:31.497
Lesson number two.

01:55:33.666 --> 01:55:35.543
Keep in touch.

01:55:54.062 --> 01:55:55.897
Let's go.

01:56:09.118 --> 01:56:11.913
No questions, no answers.

01:56:11.996 --> 01:56:14.123
That's the business we're in.

01:56:14.207 --> 01:56:16.501
You accept it and move on.

01:56:17.919 --> 01:56:20.713
Maybe that's lesson number three.
