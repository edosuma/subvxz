Hi, Ryder.
Hi, Marshall.

15:51.567 --> 15:52.182
(Cow mooing)

pink piglets!

(Cow mooing)

15:58.558 --> 15:59.941
I'm afraid that box
isn't piglets.

to go to Mr. Porter's.

(Oinking)

20:00.667 --> 20:01.766
(Meowing)

20:01.767 --> 20:02.866
(Oinking)

20:02.869 --> 20:03.484
(Splashing)

20:03.485 --> 20:04.100
(Oinking)

20:04.103 --> 20:05.236
Oops, sorry!

20:05.237 --> 20:06.370
(Oinking)

20:09.175 --> 20:09.607
Hmph!

20:09.609 --> 20:11.125
It's not fireworks.
It's brushes!

20:11.126 --> 20:12.642
Hmph!

20:12.645 --> 20:14.779
Katie, did you get any other
boxes delivered today?

20:14.780 --> 20:16.914
Hmph!

20:16.916 --> 20:17.298
That one!

20:17.299 --> 20:17.681
Hmph!

20:17.684 --> 20:18.566
MARSHALL:
Fireworks!

20:18.567 --> 20:19.449
Hmph!

20:19.452 --> 20:20.418
Ryder, we found them!

20:20.419 --> 20:21.385
Hmph!

20:21.387 --> 20:21.953
Perfect!

20:21.954 --> 20:22.520
Hmph!

20:22.522 --> 20:24.205
Come on, Marshall!

20:24.206 --> 20:25.889
Hmph!

20:25.892 --> 20:27.208
Hmph.

20:27.209 --> 20:28.525
Hmph!

20:28.528 --> 20:29.410
Two more to go.

20:29.411 --> 20:30.293
Hmph!

20:30.296 --> 20:30.978
Where could they be?

20:30.979 --> 20:31.661
Hmph!

20:31.664 --> 20:32.296
(Oinking)

20:32.297 --> 20:32.929
Hmph!

20:32.932 --> 20:34.132
Ryder, I found one,
but he's out on the bay.

20:34.133 --> 20:35.333
Hmph!

20:35.335 --> 20:35.900
I need your help!

20:35.901 --> 20:36.466
Hmph!

20:36.469 --> 20:36.884
RYDER:
<i> I'm on my way.</i>

20:36.885 --> 20:37.300
Hmph!

20:37.303 --> 20:39.237
Marshall, get the fireworks
to Cap'n Turbot.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.172
Hmph!

20:41.174 --> 20:41.723
I'll help Chase!

20:41.724 --> 20:42.273
Hmph!

20:42.275 --> 20:43.358
MARSHALL:
No problem!

20:43.359 --> 20:44.442
Hmph!

20:44.444 --> 20:45.527
Lifejacket, deploy!

20:45.528 --> 20:46.611
Hmph!

20:46.613 --> 20:47.796
(Beeping)

20:47.797 --> 20:48.980
Hmph!

20:55.722 --> 20:57.255
Here, little piggy.

20:57.257 --> 20:58.239
(Oinking)

20:58.240 --> 20:59.222
Here, little piggy.

20:59.225 --> 21:00.041
Okay, Chase,
you know what to do.

21:00.042 --> 21:00.858
Here, little piggy.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.677
Woof! Net!

21:02.678 --> 21:04.495
Here, little piggy.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.080
(Oinking)

21:06.081 --> 21:07.664
Here, little piggy.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.305
(Panting)

21:14.307 --> 21:15.623
Great job, Chase!

21:15.624 --> 21:16.940
(Panting)

21:16.943 --> 21:17.392
Thanks!

21:17.393 --> 21:17.842
(Panting)

21:17.844 --> 21:19.527
But there's still
one piglet left.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.211
(Panting)

21:23.516 --> 21:24.949
Hi, Ryder!

21:24.951 --> 21:25.433
Hi, Cap'n Turbot!

21:25.434 --> 21:25.916
Hi, Ryder!

21:25.918 --> 21:27.351
Marshall's got the fireworks
for you, safe and sound.

21:27.352 --> 21:28.785
Hi, Ryder!

21:28.788 --> 21:29.721
Aren't you staying
to watch the show?

21:29.722 --> 21:30.655
Hi, Ryder!

21:30.657 --> 21:31.706
We'll be back!

21:31.707 --> 21:32.756
Hi, Ryder!

21:32.759 --> 21:33.308
(Snorting)

21:33.309 --> 21:33.858
Hi, Ryder!

21:33.860 --> 21:35.043
Fabulous, five little piggies!

21:35.044 --> 21:36.227
Hi, Ryder!

21:36.229 --> 21:38.479
And there you go,
little number five!

21:38.480 --> 21:40.730
Hi, Ryder!

21:40.733 --> 21:41.499
Awww!

21:41.500 --> 21:42.266
Hi, Ryder!

21:42.268 --> 21:43.568
Ryder, where could that
last piglet be?

21:43.569 --> 21:44.869
Hi, Ryder!

21:44.871 --> 21:45.637
Oh, the poor dear!

21:45.638 --> 21:46.404
Hi, Ryder!

21:46.406 --> 21:47.255
I bet he's tired
and hungry.

21:47.256 --> 21:48.105
Hi, Ryder!

21:48.107 --> 21:49.023
Hungry? That's it!

21:49.024 --> 21:49.940
Hi, Ryder!

21:49.942 --> 21:50.975
Mayor Goodway,
do you have more corn?

21:50.976 --> 21:52.009
Hi, Ryder!

21:52.011 --> 21:53.311
Oh, I've got a purse
full of it.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.612
Hi, Ryder!

21:54.614 --> 21:55.997
Chase, can you call the piglet
to dinner?

21:55.998 --> 21:57.381
Hi, Ryder!

21:57.383 --> 21:58.633
Ruff, megaphone!

21:58.634 --> 21:59.884
Hi, Ryder!

21:59.886 --> 22:00.685
Sooie! Sooie!

22:00.686 --> 22:01.485
Hi, Ryder!

22:01.487 --> 22:02.870
Sooie!

22:02.871 --> 22:04.254
Hi, Ryder!

22:04.257 --> 22:05.039
Come on, little piglet!

22:05.040 --> 22:05.822
Hi, Ryder!

22:05.825 --> 22:06.174
Oh!

22:06.175 --> 22:06.524
Hi, Ryder!

22:06.526 --> 22:06.891
Great job, Chase.

22:06.892 --> 22:07.257
Hi, Ryder!

22:07.260 --> 22:08.276
The fireworks show
is about to start!

22:08.277 --> 22:09.293
Hi, Ryder!

22:09.295 --> 22:10.595
We won't have time
to get these piglets home.

22:10.596 --> 22:11.896
Hi, Ryder!

22:11.898 --> 22:13.581
I have an idea.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.265
Hi, Ryder!

22:15.268 --> 22:16.234
Wee, wee, wee,
wee, wee!

22:16.235 --> 22:17.201
Hi, Ryder!

22:17.203 --> 22:18.286
(Laughing)

22:18.287 --> 22:19.370
Hi, Ryder!

22:19.372 --> 22:19.704
Ryder, thank you!

22:19.705 --> 22:20.037
Hi, Ryder!

22:20.039 --> 22:21.489
You and the PAW Patrol saved
the summer picnic!

22:21.490 --> 22:22.940
Hi, Ryder!

22:22.942 --> 22:24.625
If you're ever in trouble,
just oink for help!

22:24.626 --> 22:26.309
Hi, Ryder!

22:26.312 --> 22:27.345
Is it fireworks time yet?

22:27.346 --> 22:28.379
Hi, Ryder!

22:28.381 --> 22:28.796
Almost.

22:28.797 --> 22:29.212
Hi, Ryder!

22:29.215 --> 22:31.649
Five, four, three,
two, one!

22:31.650 --> 22:34.084
Hi, Ryder!

22:34.921 --> 22:37.254
(Fireworks exploding)

22:37.256 --> 22:38.155
(Cheering, pups barking)

22:38.156 --> 22:39.055
(Fireworks exploding)

22:39.058 --> 22:40.041
Awesome!
All right!

22:40.042 --> 22:41.025
(Fireworks exploding)

22:41.027 --> 22:42.677
(Pigs oinking)

22:42.678 --> 22:44.328
(Fireworks exploding)

22:44.330 --> 22:45.746
Wow, awesome!

22:45.747 --> 22:47.163
(Fireworks exploding)
