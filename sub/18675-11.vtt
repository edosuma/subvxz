28:51.834 --> 28:56.291
If I wanted to hurt you,
you'd be hurt by now.

28:56.291 --> 28:58.667
You must know that,
right?

28:58.667 --> 29:01.750
So,
tell me your thoughts.

29:06.375 --> 29:09.375
A website doesn't sound
like Quinn.

29:09.375 --> 29:10.375
Okay.

29:10.375 --> 29:12.375
At all.

29:12.375 --> 29:15.458
And it's not just that
he's always so secret

29:15.458 --> 29:18.083
about everything.

29:18.083 --> 29:19.959
I've never
seen him online.

29:19.959 --> 29:22.083
I don't even think
he uses e-mail.

29:22.083 --> 29:23.500
Which means?

29:24.834 --> 29:27.542
Maybe someone's
impersonating him.

29:27.542 --> 29:27.875
Who would do that?

29:30.583 --> 29:32.708
It's exactly what that place
where I've been working

29:32.708 --> 29:34.959
is set up to do.

29:34.959 --> 29:36.875
Ah.

29:36.875 --> 29:38.917
Only, why have I never
seen this thing?

29:38.917 --> 29:40.959
Because the only place
it exists so far

29:40.959 --> 29:44.417
is on your boss's computer
in his office.

29:44.417 --> 29:47.583
Then why not ask him
about it?

29:47.583 --> 29:49.208
He'd rather
I didn't know.

29:54.500 --> 29:57.208
Can you get
into his computer?

29:57.208 --> 29:58.458
No.

29:58.458 --> 30:00.083
Not even for Quinn?

30:02.792 --> 30:08.125
There's a daily backup
ported offsite.

30:08.125 --> 30:09.834
I may be able
to get into that.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.083
Good afternoon, ladies and
gentlemen, friends and enemies.

30:19.083 --> 30:23.125
Welcome to a very special
edition of "Real. Truth."

30:23.125 --> 30:24.959
Special because my guest

30:24.959 --> 30:27.333
is the next president
of the United States,

30:27.333 --> 30:28.667
Elizabeth Keane.

30:28.667 --> 30:30.291
Welcome,
Madam President-Elect.

30:30.291 --> 30:32.458
Thank you.

30:32.458 --> 30:36.041
So, let me ask you what everyone
is asking right now --

30:36.041 --> 30:37.375
why are you here?

30:37.375 --> 30:38.917
Because you invited me.

30:38.917 --> 30:41.458
Well, I've often invited you,
but, usually, you prefer

30:41.458 --> 30:42.458
the loving arms
of the mainstream media.

30:42.458 --> 30:44.417
[chuckles]

30:44.417 --> 30:45.750
Trust me, I have taken
some beatings

30:45.750 --> 30:47.250
from the
mainstream media.

30:47.250 --> 30:48.417
[chuckles]

30:48.417 --> 30:51.166
I'm here because a video
was released last night

30:51.166 --> 30:53.041
which viciously slandered
my dead son.

30:53.041 --> 30:56.166
I challenged the people
responsible for making it

30:56.166 --> 30:57.375
to show their faces,
and you did.

30:57.375 --> 30:58.875
So, here I am.

30:58.875 --> 31:02.500
You do know it's not slander
if it's true?

31:02.500 --> 31:03.667
It's not true.

31:03.667 --> 31:05.125
Not true.

31:05.125 --> 31:06.500
Have you seen it?

31:06.500 --> 31:08.333
I have -- more than
a dozen times.

31:08.333 --> 31:11.125
Perhaps I can
remind you.

31:11.125 --> 31:11.708
[narrator]
...Captain Keane do?

31:11.708 --> 31:14.291
[Rudy] He ran past me.

31:14.291 --> 31:15.583
He was shouting...

31:15.583 --> 31:17.917
[Andrew] "Out of the way!
Get out of the [bleep] way!"

31:17.917 --> 31:20.375
[narrator] Some men
run towards the fight.

31:20.375 --> 31:22.625
Andrew Keane just ran away.

31:22.625 --> 31:23.375
[gunfire]

31:23.375 --> 31:26.458
Cowardice runs in the family.

31:27.208 --> 31:30.542
As I said,
I have seen it.

31:30.542 --> 31:32.917
And I have to ask, why would
you want to make a mother --

31:32.917 --> 31:36.708
any mother -- watch the last
moments of her son's life?

31:36.708 --> 31:40.625
I know it must be painful
for you

31:40.625 --> 31:43.250
and I-I'm sorry.

31:43.250 --> 31:44.834
But I want to be clear
about this.

31:44.834 --> 31:46.834
You say --
You say it's not true.

31:46.834 --> 31:49.500
Are you accusing these men
of lying?

31:49.500 --> 31:51.708
Yes, I am.

31:51.708 --> 31:54.708
Either they're confused
or they've been suborned.

31:54.708 --> 31:57.583
What about the footage?
Is it lying?

31:57.583 --> 32:00.166
Why does it end there, on a shot
of my son running away?

32:00.166 --> 32:00.750
Because that's
what he did.

32:00.750 --> 32:03.041
But what happens next?

32:03.041 --> 32:05.041
Six eyewitnesses testified
Andrew was killed

32:05.041 --> 32:07.625
pulling a wounded soldier
out of enemy fire.

32:07.625 --> 32:10.333
So, what happens next?

32:10.333 --> 32:11.959
Where is the
original footage?

32:11.959 --> 32:14.000
You produced the video.
You must have it.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.125
You know why I produced
the video?

32:16.125 --> 32:18.417
To destroy the memory
of my son,

32:18.417 --> 32:21.166
to hurt me, and to damage
my presidency.

32:21.166 --> 32:23.250
No, no, and no.

32:23.250 --> 32:26.208
I produced the video
because some people --

32:26.208 --> 32:30.000
people you call cowards, though
every one of them's a veteran --

32:30.000 --> 32:33.125
came to me with a story
of injustice.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.875
No one believed them because
it involved a powerful person

32:35.875 --> 32:38.750
with an even more
powerful mother.

32:38.750 --> 32:40.542
They were voiceless.

32:40.542 --> 32:41.792
They were hurting.

32:41.792 --> 32:45.125
Well,
thank God they had film,

32:45.125 --> 32:46.125
and thank God
I could do my bit

32:46.125 --> 32:49.917
to make our democracy
a little more equal.

32:49.917 --> 32:53.250
Creating false stories doesn't
make democracy more equal.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.291
It harms it deeply.

32:54.291 --> 32:56.583
Let people see all of the film.
Let them judge.

32:56.583 --> 32:58.917
They already have.

32:58.917 --> 33:00.625
Five million views
in the first hour,

33:00.625 --> 33:02.041
more than two million posts.

33:02.041 --> 33:03.959
One-and-a-half million of those
post came within a minute

33:03.959 --> 33:05.500
of the video
being released.

33:05.500 --> 33:06.041
How is that possible?

33:06.041 --> 33:07.792
People were angry.

33:07.792 --> 33:09.875
They felt that you tricked them,
stole the election

33:09.875 --> 33:12.792
on the back of your son's fake
war record, so they responded.

33:12.792 --> 33:15.125
People didn't respond.

33:15.125 --> 33:16.708
That is a physical
impossibility.

33:16.708 --> 33:19.083
Those numbers exist

33:19.083 --> 33:21.125
because a vast majority of
those posts were made by bots --

33:21.125 --> 33:24.917
digital entities
pretending to be people.

33:24.917 --> 33:27.542
Dig into those identities
and you find no one --

33:27.542 --> 33:29.166
no real names,
no Social Security numbers,

33:29.166 --> 33:33.667
no addresses, no jobs,
just a stream of hate.

33:33.667 --> 33:36.542
Dig deeper, you find many of
these bots are run in a place

33:36.542 --> 33:39.125
called the Office
of Policy Coordination,

33:39.125 --> 33:42.000
which is in a building
off of I-95,

33:42.000 --> 33:44.375
with a control center
six floors underground.

33:44.375 --> 33:46.875
Underground.
An underground bunker?

33:46.875 --> 33:47.667
-Yes.
-Really?

33:47.667 --> 33:51.000
Yes.
Run out of this studio.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.375
You didn't just produce
the lying video.

33:52.375 --> 33:55.667
You faked the hate and the lies
that accompanied it.

33:55.667 --> 33:57.667
People hate you,
Madam President-Elect.

33:57.667 --> 34:00.375
No one's faking that.

34:00.375 --> 34:02.041
Boy, are they angry.

34:02.041 --> 34:03.250
You know what would make them
even angrier?

34:03.250 --> 34:06.500
If they learned
how your operation was funded.

34:06.500 --> 34:07.417
Excuse me?

34:07.417 --> 34:08.750
If they learned
you were financed

34:08.750 --> 34:10.708
by the same establishment
you claim to despise.

34:10.708 --> 34:12.375
That is an
outrageous lie!

34:12.375 --> 34:14.750
You are not a free voice
speaking truth to power.

34:14.750 --> 34:15.500
You're a
government shill.

34:15.500 --> 34:16.542
Now we are
talking slander.

34:16.542 --> 34:19.250
I have evidence of collusion
with serving members

34:19.250 --> 34:20.041
of the
intelligence community.

34:20.041 --> 34:21.750
It will go
to the Attorney General.

34:21.750 --> 34:24.083
You will be prosecuted.

34:24.083 --> 34:25.458
You will be shut down.

34:25.458 --> 34:27.917
Because in my government,
truth will have a value,

34:27.917 --> 34:30.083
and you will have
no place.

34:31.917 --> 34:34.208
Wow.

34:34.208 --> 34:37.083
Just wow.

34:37.083 --> 34:39.250
I don't even know
how to respond.

34:42.208 --> 34:45.333
You've even got my
switchboard going crazy.

34:45.333 --> 34:46.417
Let's take a call.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.291
Hi.
You're on "Real. Truth."

34:48.291 --> 34:49.917
[Bill] Hey, there.
This is Bill.

34:49.917 --> 34:50.959
I just want to say --

34:50.959 --> 34:52.250
Hang on, Bill.

34:52.250 --> 34:54.333
Are you real?

34:54.333 --> 34:55.375
What?

34:55.375 --> 34:57.417
Are you real?

34:57.417 --> 35:00.083
Because the president-elect
doesn't think you are.

35:00.083 --> 35:01.917
What the fuck?
Yeah, man, I'm real.

35:01.917 --> 35:06.708
You're not a-a fake,
a-a-a bot?

35:06.708 --> 35:08.083
No, I'm fucking not.

35:08.083 --> 35:09.750
She's just trying to dodge
the issue.

35:09.750 --> 35:11.250
What is the issue,
Bill?

35:11.250 --> 35:11.875
Andrew Keane is.

35:11.875 --> 35:14.500
I was in Iraq, okay?

35:14.500 --> 35:16.083
Everybody knew
he got special treatment

35:16.083 --> 35:17.834
because his mama
was a senator.

35:17.834 --> 35:19.542
It didn't keep him
from getting killed.

35:19.542 --> 35:22.083
He was killed
because he was coward.

35:22.083 --> 35:23.708
He should be dug up
out of Arlington

35:23.708 --> 35:25.250
because that's
for real heroes.

35:25.250 --> 35:27.291
And I'll tell you
something else, for free --

35:27.291 --> 35:28.417
your son runs
like a fucking girl.

35:37.417 --> 35:40.208
Uh, like I said,
people...

35:40.208 --> 35:41.959
people are angry.

35:41.959 --> 35:44.500
A random caller, huh?

35:44.500 --> 35:47.542
I don't think so.
I've noticed this about you.

35:47.542 --> 35:48.583
Whenever you are trapped
in a lie,

35:48.583 --> 35:52.250
you raise your voice
and change the subject.

35:52.250 --> 35:52.333
Not today.

35:55.083 --> 35:57.125
We're done here.

36:02.792 --> 36:04.917
[police radio chatter]

36:12.166 --> 36:13.834
-Carrie.
-Hello, sir.

36:13.834 --> 36:15.041
[car door closes]

36:15.041 --> 36:17.834
So, what exactly
is this place?

36:17.834 --> 36:19.375
According to Quinn,
it's a briefing post

36:19.375 --> 36:21.542
for special-ops teams
heading to the Middle East.

36:21.542 --> 36:24.208
He staged out of here himself
for almost a year.

36:24.208 --> 36:25.166
I got a call
from the agent in charge.

36:25.166 --> 36:28.208
He said there's some issue
with the body.

36:54.625 --> 36:56.792
What's his name?

36:56.792 --> 36:59.250
The license says
Porteous Belli.

36:59.250 --> 37:00.750
I doubt it's real.

37:00.750 --> 37:03.375
You want to tell me
how this happened?

37:03.375 --> 37:05.708
He was trying to kill me.
Quinn stopped him.

37:07.125 --> 37:09.667
Things got
a little crazy.

37:09.667 --> 37:11.208
I guess so.

37:11.208 --> 37:13.333
He was choking me out.
Quinn saved my life.

37:13.333 --> 37:14.875
It never occurred
to either of you

37:14.875 --> 37:17.250
this guy could have been
a major witness?

37:20.125 --> 37:21.291
We still have the van.

37:21.291 --> 37:22.333
Show me.

37:33.750 --> 37:36.083
Incredible.

37:36.083 --> 37:39.125
There's a photo of Sekou with
his mom and sister on the visor.

37:41.166 --> 37:42.125
It's what
you've been asking for --

37:42.125 --> 37:44.417
an actual
prosecutable case.

37:44.417 --> 37:45.625
Quinn handed it to us.

37:49.458 --> 37:51.500
His immunity deal
covers everything, right?

37:55.083 --> 37:55.583
We'll make it work.

37:58.041 --> 38:00.250
[O'Keefe] I met power today.

38:00.250 --> 38:04.834
Power came to my place of work,

38:04.834 --> 38:09.542
surrounded by goose-stepping men
in long coats.

38:09.542 --> 38:11.750
And I'll be honest --

38:11.750 --> 38:12.875
I was afraid.

38:12.875 --> 38:15.250
Afraid.

38:15.250 --> 38:16.959
I felt the weight of the state,

38:16.959 --> 38:21.083
that jackboot on my neck

38:21.083 --> 38:24.792
when I heard these words
from the president-elect --

38:24.792 --> 38:26.917
"You will be prosecuted.

38:26.917 --> 38:28.959
You will be shut down.

38:28.959 --> 38:33.917
Because in my government,
you will have no place."

38:33.917 --> 38:37.041
For a moment there, I thought
I might have changed some minds.

38:37.041 --> 38:38.834
You did.

38:38.834 --> 38:40.500
Just don't expect
to change his.

38:40.500 --> 38:43.792
Whatever happened to government
of the people,

38:43.792 --> 38:45.250
by the people,
for the people?

38:45.250 --> 38:47.834
I'll tell you
what happened.

38:47.834 --> 38:50.125
-Whether by fraud or deceit...
-Turn it off, please.

38:50.125 --> 38:51.708
[O'Keefe]
...or our own collective --

38:54.792 --> 38:57.583
I want you to know how grateful
I am you came forward.

38:57.583 --> 38:58.000
It couldn't have
been easy.

38:58.000 --> 39:01.083
[chuckles]

39:01.083 --> 39:02.834
'Cause you're about to throw me
under the bus to get Dar?

39:02.834 --> 39:04.583
Yes.

39:04.583 --> 39:08.250
That and because I know
how protective you are

39:08.250 --> 39:09.542
of the Agency.

39:09.542 --> 39:13.083
Whatever is going on here,
it's not the Agency.

39:13.083 --> 39:15.417
Not mine, anyway.

39:15.417 --> 39:18.083
Well, they're out
in the open now, thanks to you.

39:18.083 --> 39:19.667
Excuse me, ma'am.
