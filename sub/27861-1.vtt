04:37.525 --> 04:41.325
Actually, you are an artist, Sandro,

you are a philosopher.

Yes, we all know how pious you are.

04:49.725 --> 04:53.045
Oh, I suppose, you'd like me to paint
lots of Pagan gods and men's penises,

04:53.125 --> 04:54.685
like all those Greeks you worship.

04:54.765 --> 04:56.845

We all do.

04:56.925 --> 04:57.885
All right, all right, all right.

04:58.085 --> 04:59.205
You're both right,

04:59.765 --> 05:01.045
and you're both wrong.

05:02.045 --> 05:03.885
You wish to depict the beauty of God

05:03.965 --> 05:07.285
and you--you wish to recreate
the wisdom of the ancients.

05:07.445 --> 05:08.925
-Precisely.
-Exactly.

you've been up all night drinking.

Don't apologize.

I might have joined you

Enjoy the wine of youth, Lorenzo.

Giuliano, tell them how I struck that man
with my stick.

10:31.165 --> 10:34.205
Father, you looked like a Greek God
from one of Poliziano's stories.

10:34.285 --> 10:37.365
There you see.
A gout ridden Greek God.

10:37.485 --> 10:38.805
I am perfectly all right.

10:38.885 --> 10:40.965
He's not all right.

10:46.645 --> 10:48.085
Hungover, more like it.

10:48.205 --> 10:50.605
If they kill Lorenzo,
we'd have to tell our own dirty jokes.

10:50.685 --> 10:51.925
And pay for your own wine.

10:53.405 --> 10:54.725
They said you killed a man.

10:54.805 --> 10:56.525
And he was stupidly brave doing it, too.

10:56.605 --> 10:58.005
He ran straight through a hail of arrows.

10:58.085 --> 10:59.245
Have the Priori been informed?

10:59.325 --> 11:01.965
Jacopo Pazzi called
an emergency meeting at his palazzo.

11:02.925 --> 11:03.965
Why his palazzo?

11:04.565 --> 11:06.365
To seize power behind closed doors.

11:07.525 --> 11:08.645
We should go.

11:09.805 --> 11:12.365
[Jacopo] This was an act of terror.

11:12.925 --> 11:14.245
Pure and simple.

11:15.565 --> 11:18.965
An attack on one of us
is an attack on us all.

11:19.365 --> 11:21.965
We must act and we must act now.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.005
Act against whom, Messer Pazzi?

11:25.965 --> 11:28.925
No one has taken responsibility
for this cowardly attack.

11:29.205 --> 11:30.245
[Lorenzo] And no-one will.

11:30.565 --> 11:32.285
[crowd] Lorenzo.

11:33.405 --> 11:35.885
Lorenzo, we are relieved beyond measure
to see you alive.

11:35.965 --> 11:37.605
Thank you, Messer Soderini.

11:37.725 --> 11:39.925
Your father will make a full recovery,
I trust?

11:40.005 --> 11:42.285
I pray that he will, Bastiano.
I pray that he will.

11:42.365 --> 11:43.605
What of the men who attacked you,

11:44.045 --> 11:45.845
have they named their paymaster?

11:45.925 --> 11:47.125
They claim not to know his name.

11:47.205 --> 11:49.685
[man] Then this without doubt
is a foreign agent.

11:49.765 --> 11:52.645
A Venetian,
opposed to our alliance with Milan.

11:52.725 --> 11:54.245
My thoughts precisely.

11:55.565 --> 11:57.405
May I address the restricted council?

12:00.325 --> 12:02.605
I am sorry, Master Lorenzo,

12:03.205 --> 12:06.525
but only members of this body
are afforded that privilege.

12:06.605 --> 12:11.125
I think we can make an exception,
Gonfaloniere.

12:11.525 --> 12:13.245
Let our young hero speak.

12:17.885 --> 12:18.925
Florence...

12:19.645 --> 12:23.405
has prospered these many years
under the leadership of my family.

12:25.605 --> 12:27.925
And so many of the dreams that my father

12:28.765 --> 12:31.965
and his father's father
had for this republic have come true.

12:32.045 --> 12:35.485
Forgive me, Lorenzo, but one man's dream
is another's nightmare.

12:36.125 --> 12:38.125
My nephew and I have never understood

12:38.205 --> 12:40.485
your family's insistence
on throwing money at the poor.

12:40.605 --> 12:42.925
We offer simple Christian charity

12:43.005 --> 12:44.965
so that those not born
into wealth and privilege

12:45.045 --> 12:46.765
might have a chance to prosper.

12:46.845 --> 12:49.645
Lorenzo, you waste funds
we can ill afford,

12:49.725 --> 12:51.925
putting the future
of this republic at risk.

12:52.005 --> 12:53.365
What did you wish to say, Lorenzo?

12:53.445 --> 12:55.765
That we need not look abroad to find men

12:55.845 --> 12:57.885
who hate the Florence
that we've brought about.

12:58.005 --> 13:00.125
I hope you are not suggesting anyone here,
young man.

13:00.205 --> 13:01.845
There, there...

13:01.925 --> 13:04.565
we must forgive young Master Lorenzo.

13:04.645 --> 13:06.845
His wisdom is parroted from books,

13:07.005 --> 13:09.245
not won through the trials of life.

13:09.725 --> 13:13.245
Everyone on the restricted council
is loyal to your family, Lorenzo.

13:13.605 --> 13:14.605
Indeed.

13:15.245 --> 13:18.325
The Medici take great pains to ensure it.

13:23.845 --> 13:26.045
I mean no offence, gentlemen,

13:27.445 --> 13:29.165
but I feel certain

13:29.805 --> 13:32.845
that war is the last thing
that my father would wish.

13:35.085 --> 13:36.885
I beg for time.

13:37.445 --> 13:39.005
Time to name the real criminal

13:39.085 --> 13:42.405
and keep one crime
from being compounded by another.

13:57.525 --> 13:58.645
[dogs barking]

13:59.165 --> 14:00.485
Bianca, stay with your father.

14:01.245 --> 14:02.285
Yes.

14:06.445 --> 14:08.365
[Lucrezia] Lorenzo. Giuliano.

14:08.445 --> 14:09.405
What's happened?

14:09.485 --> 14:11.925
Priori have given us time
to determine who is behind the attack.

14:12.005 --> 14:12.965
You'll do no such thing.

14:13.045 --> 14:15.205
Jacopo Pazzi believes that
Venice was responsible.

14:15.725 --> 14:17.245
He'll vote for war
unless we can prove otherwise.

14:17.325 --> 14:19.285
A war that would bleed this republic dry.

14:19.365 --> 14:20.565
Listen to me, you are safe now,

14:20.645 --> 14:22.925
but whoever tried to kill you today
could do so again.

14:23.005 --> 14:25.165
Which is why we need to determine
who was behind the attack.

14:25.285 --> 14:27.085
Don't worry, Mother. We'll be careful.

14:29.005 --> 14:30.005
Come on.

14:31.885 --> 14:32.965

How are you?

14:42.725 --> 14:43.645
I'm fine.

14:45.525 --> 14:46.685
No, you are not.

14:48.405 --> 14:49.845
I can see it.

14:55.725 --> 14:56.965
I killed a man today.

15:00.045 --> 15:01.685
I watched the life

15:02.405 --> 15:03.565
drain from his eyes.

15:04.005 --> 15:05.085
It was self-defense.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.365
As soon as he killed the guards,
you had no choice.

15:07.725 --> 15:08.845
I know, I know.

15:12.125 --> 15:13.885
And yet I took a life.

15:15.885 --> 15:18.285
Everything that that man was,
everything that...

15:19.445 --> 15:21.965
everything that he'll ever be
is gone from this world...

15:22.525 --> 15:23.365
forever.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.045
It weighs on you, as it should,

15:29.645 --> 15:31.045
but you made the right choice, son.

15:32.205 --> 15:34.085
And in the eyes of man and God,

15:34.765 --> 15:36.445
you must make peace with it.

16:33.765 --> 16:35.605
These are beautiful.

16:36.685 --> 16:39.725
Each panel shows a medjay
heading to Bethlehem

16:39.805 --> 16:40.965
to witness the nativity.

16:41.925 --> 16:43.205
Do you recognize them?

16:50.045 --> 16:52.845
But they weren't in Bethlehem.
What does it mean?

16:53.885 --> 16:57.845
[Contessina] It means our family
is here to serve God, as the medjay did.

16:59.125 --> 17:01.045
And now look who's leading us all.
Is that me?

17:21.885 --> 17:23.324
One day you will lead us...

17:23.725 --> 17:26.765
as you father led this family
and his father before him.

17:31.844 --> 17:33.005
Does it scare you?

Let the fear drive you

18:53.405 --> 18:54.445
Of course.

I can't-- I can't be sure, but...

No, I don't think so.

I have no mind for politics, Bianca,
you know that.

19:05.565 --> 19:07.845
But Sandro and Giuliano
are looking into it.

19:08.005 --> 19:11.005
Once they clear your uncle,
we declare our love.

19:11.085 --> 19:13.005
-We couldn't possibly do that.
-Why not?

19:13.085 --> 19:16.485
My uncle would never consent,
I doubt your father would either.

19:16.845 --> 19:18.445
He agreed to our marriage once before.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.725
When we were children.

19:21.485 --> 19:25.005
Your father and brothers
nearly lost their lives yesterday, Bianca.

19:27.005 --> 19:28.605
We must be careful...

19:29.845 --> 19:31.005
lest we lose ours.

19:51.005 --> 19:52.045
[Francesco] Uncle.

19:54.285 --> 19:55.285
Uncle.

19:55.965 --> 19:56.845
Gianni...

19:57.965 --> 19:58.805
good to see you.

19:58.885 --> 20:00.165
And you, Master Francesco.

20:01.245 --> 20:02.085
Brother.

20:02.605 --> 20:04.085
What a wonderful surprise!

20:04.525 --> 20:06.845
We weren't expecting you home
until next month.

20:08.525 --> 20:09.445
You should have written.

20:11.645 --> 20:13.645
Our affairs in Rome are back in order.

20:14.725 --> 20:17.565
Although I am sorry to report
the Holy Father is ill.

20:18.125 --> 20:20.085
I will not shed a tear when he passes.

20:20.165 --> 20:21.765
The Pope was no friend to us.

20:23.245 --> 20:26.925
I heard there was an assassination attempt

20:27.085 --> 20:28.245
on the Medici yesterday.

20:29.885 --> 20:31.005
Were you involved?

20:33.725 --> 20:36.525
You have been away
too long and forgotten, nephew.

20:36.685 --> 20:38.565
I ask the questions here, not you.

20:42.045 --> 20:42.965
Come.
Let's get a drink.

20:44.485 --> 20:45.645
At the Dove.

20:46.405 --> 20:47.485
The Dove is closed.

20:48.445 --> 20:49.965
-[Francesco] Since when?
-This morning.

20:50.045 --> 20:52.045
They said the Medici revoked their credit.

20:52.285 --> 20:54.245
Well, there's more than one
tavern in Florence.

20:54.925 --> 20:56.085
[Jacopo] You will drink later.

20:57.285 --> 20:59.965
A change to Rome
may bring change to Florence

21:00.645 --> 21:03.205
and with Piero recalling loans,

21:03.285 --> 21:05.445
there may be better ways
of destroying the Medici

21:05.525 --> 21:06.725
than with a blade.

21:18.045 --> 21:19.125
[footsteps approaching]

21:20.845 --> 21:22.125
Lorenzo...

21:22.805 --> 21:24.445
and your beautiful mother.

21:24.885 --> 21:25.965
[Lucrezia] General Sforza.

21:26.045 --> 21:26.885
Ma donna.

21:29.925 --> 21:32.725
Surely you've not forgotten
your kind invitation.

21:33.445 --> 21:34.685
No. No.

21:34.925 --> 21:37.125
Certainly not.
We'll ready your rooms at once.

21:38.965 --> 21:41.645
That is by that young artist, Botticelli,
isn't it?

21:44.805 --> 21:45.965
Magnificent.

21:46.885 --> 21:48.325
Where's your father, boy?

21:48.405 --> 21:49.405
[footsteps approaching]

21:51.205 --> 21:52.405
I am right here.

21:53.565 --> 21:55.165
You should rest, Father.

21:55.245 --> 21:56.405
I am rested.

21:57.285 --> 21:58.645
Come, Galeazzo.

22:00.925 --> 22:02.925
[pigeons cooing]

22:05.085 --> 22:07.405
Perhaps your son is right, Messer Medici.

22:08.125 --> 22:09.125
You should rest.
[breathing heavily]

22:10.605 --> 22:13.005
Seeing you here puts my mind at rest.

22:13.085 --> 22:16.005
We hear a Venetian
ordered the assassination attempt

22:16.525 --> 22:18.725
in an effort to disrupt our alliance.

22:19.045 --> 22:21.205
We'll get to the bottom of it soon enough.

22:21.645 --> 22:24.005
In the meantime,
you and I have business to discuss.

22:25.005 --> 22:25.965
Do we?

22:26.045 --> 22:28.525
You don't think
I asked you all this way to socialize?

22:29.805 --> 22:31.725
You refer to my father's debt.

22:32.125 --> 22:34.485
Your noble father died three years ago.

22:34.925 --> 22:37.605
Now you are the duke, the debt is yours.

22:37.725 --> 22:39.845
I am afraid it must remain unpaid.

22:39.925 --> 22:42.925
But its obligation is due,
past due, in fact.

22:43.005 --> 22:44.325
I don't have it.

22:44.405 --> 22:46.925
All our funds were invested
in weaponary and soldiers.

22:47.045 --> 22:47.925
[Piero] Soldiers?

22:48.485 --> 22:50.645
Milan is surrounded by enemies.

22:50.845 --> 22:53.485
Surely you understand that security
must come before all else.

22:56.765 --> 22:58.725
I see I have put you
in a difficult situation.

22:59.525 --> 23:00.565
Never mind.

23:00.845 --> 23:02.485
It's not your concern.

23:02.565 --> 23:03.765
But it is.

23:04.085 --> 23:06.045
The Medici are allies to Milan.

23:06.125 --> 23:08.125
And if your family is weakened,

23:08.445 --> 23:09.325
we are weakened, too.

23:11.925 --> 23:13.645
Confide in a friend, Messer.

23:18.965 --> 23:21.805
The bank has been overextended for months.

23:22.485 --> 23:27.005
I began by recalling smaller debts
to buy time but they are not enough.

23:27.925 --> 23:29.885
If your debt is unrepaid

23:29.965 --> 23:32.965
then our assets will be seized
and our power gone.

23:33.405 --> 23:34.845
Is it as bad as that?

23:40.445 --> 23:44.045
I cannot repay my debt with money,
Messer Medici.

23:45.005 --> 23:47.125
But perhaps I can repay it another way.

23:48.405 --> 23:49.605
What other way?

23:50.165 --> 23:51.845
Your position is threatened

23:52.205 --> 23:55.125
but with my army, you could restore it.

23:55.565 --> 23:57.085
Crush your enemies

23:57.925 --> 23:59.525
and we call my father's debt settled.

23:59.605 --> 24:03.085
After your men have done raping,
looting and pillaging this city?

24:03.165 --> 24:05.045
I know you wouldn't have
wished for the occupation of Florence

24:05.125 --> 24:06.405
but surely needs must.

24:07.485 --> 24:09.925
To preserve the power of your family.

24:12.645 --> 24:14.245
My men are within riding distance.

24:15.085 --> 24:16.325
Just say the word,

24:16.925 --> 24:18.365
and the Medici are saved.

24:34.565 --> 24:35.645
We need to talk.

24:45.885 --> 24:46.765
[Lorenzo] Well...

24:50.005 --> 24:53.005
We went to an inn
where the assassins were staying,

24:53.085 --> 24:54.845
and found this hidden in their bags.

24:55.045 --> 24:56.245
[Lorenzo] The Pazzi seal.

24:56.325 --> 24:58.445
Which proves Jacopo Pazzi hired them.

24:58.525 --> 24:59.525
You don't know that.

25:00.805 --> 25:02.165
Not for certain.

25:02.245 --> 25:03.405
Why else would it be there?

25:04.925 --> 25:07.405
You must take this evidence
to the Priori right away.

25:07.925 --> 25:08.925
No.

25:09.765 --> 25:11.525
No, we'll take it to Jacopo Pazzi.

25:11.605 --> 25:13.085
Whatever for?

25:13.485 --> 25:14.845
Well, if he's innocent

25:14.925 --> 25:17.565
then giving him the chance to prove it
binds him to our cause.

25:17.645 --> 25:19.165
If not then we go the Priori

25:19.285 --> 25:20.845
having already assumed
that we're fair-minded.

25:21.205 --> 25:23.885
We care about justice for father
not old-man Pazzi.

25:23.965 --> 25:25.245
If we want justice,

25:25.885 --> 25:27.485
then we will treat others justly.

25:39.725 --> 25:40.725
Wait here.

25:53.365 --> 25:54.885
Well, well.

25:54.965 --> 25:58.925
That's twice in as many days the Medici
boys grace us with their presence.

25:59.405 --> 26:00.685
[Jacopo laughs]

26:01.925 --> 26:04.445
You remember Guglielmo's brother,
don't you?

26:05.525 --> 26:06.805
Francesco.

26:07.565 --> 26:10.525
The last time we saw each other
we had words over a lady.

26:12.485 --> 26:15.165
Let's let bygones be bygones, shall we?

26:16.645 --> 26:17.565
Let's not.

26:18.925 --> 26:20.325
Pazzi.

26:20.925 --> 26:22.885
[Jacopo laughs] Now, now, boys.

26:22.965 --> 26:24.165
How can we help you?

26:25.925 --> 26:29.405
Sandro Botticelli and I... found this.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.885
In the assassin's chambers.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.485
How did that get there?

26:33.965 --> 26:35.045
Hmm.

26:35.645 --> 26:37.325
We're hoping
you could help us out with that.

26:37.405 --> 26:39.605
You can't think
I had anything to do with it?

26:39.685 --> 26:42.165
Well, the medallion
bears your seal, does it not?

26:42.565 --> 26:43.525
Can you explain that?

26:45.085 --> 26:46.525
Giuliano must have planted it,

26:47.765 --> 26:51.125
in an effort to distract
from his ridiculous father.

26:52.685 --> 26:53.805
[sword unsheathing]

26:58.965 --> 27:00.165
Messer Pazzi, I...

27:00.245 --> 27:01.525
Guards!

27:03.925 --> 27:05.245
Stop, please! Put down your weapons.

27:05.325 --> 27:06.445
We come here in peace.

27:06.845 --> 27:08.805
And your brother leaves in chains.

27:09.565 --> 27:10.925
Arrest him.

27:11.405 --> 27:13.525
It was an accident, it was an accident.

27:19.365 --> 27:20.525
It's all right, brother.

27:21.485 --> 27:23.085
I don't mind spending the night in jail.

27:23.565 --> 27:27.485
Not if it means the Priori get to see
what Pazzi justice is really like.

27:27.565 --> 27:31.165
-You'll hang for attempted murder.
-It won't be me who hangs for that.

27:48.965 --> 27:50.725
[Sandro] Well, well.

27:50.925 --> 27:52.525
We are the wounded party,

27:52.605 --> 27:54.965
now Jacopo gets to play victim,
I'm telling you...

27:55.405 --> 27:56.525
Giuliano's temper.

27:56.645 --> 27:57.645
[man] Medici.

27:58.245 --> 28:00.245
Piero de' Medici's boy.

28:01.325 --> 28:02.205
Yes.

28:02.285 --> 28:04.925
Thank God that arrow
didn't hit your father in the heart.

28:05.045 --> 28:06.925
-Thank you, friend.
-Oh, I am no friend.

28:07.805 --> 28:10.845
If it had hit your father's heart,
it would have bounced off stone.

28:11.725 --> 28:12.765
Hey.

28:12.845 --> 28:15.205
He gives a working man a loan

28:15.285 --> 28:16.965
and two years to pay it off,

28:17.165 --> 28:18.965
and then demands it all in a week.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.365
I graft and graft...

28:21.445 --> 28:23.005
one flick of his quill, I lose my business

28:23.085 --> 28:24.965
and my family are living on the street.

28:26.085 --> 28:27.485
I think there must be some mistake.
There are plenty of mistakes.

28:29.045 --> 28:30.565
I know a dozen merchants

28:30.645 --> 28:33.885
chucked out of their homes,
thanks to your father.

28:34.365 --> 28:35.685
Let's go. We need to go.

28:36.885 --> 28:39.165
Your grandfather
would never have done this.

28:39.245 --> 28:40.645
He fired those arrows.

28:40.725 --> 28:43.285
They came from the heavens.

28:48.765 --> 28:50.125
Will I live?

28:50.205 --> 28:51.485
Hmm.

28:52.445 --> 28:55.165
Your humors are out of balance.

28:56.005 --> 28:57.245
But the pus...

28:57.525 --> 29:00.685
indicates your body
is ridding itself of toxins.

29:02.885 --> 29:06.205
I recommend you should drink
plenty of wine.

29:06.285 --> 29:08.325
A most welcome prescription.

29:08.445 --> 29:09.565
[door opens]

29:11.965 --> 29:14.045
Well, I am not dead.

29:15.765 --> 29:17.085
From the looks on your faces,

29:17.165 --> 29:18.965
one would think
you have come to my funeral.

29:19.045 --> 29:20.565
Our son has just seen the Pazzi.

29:20.645 --> 29:23.245
We found evidence
that Jacopo hired the assassins.

29:24.365 --> 29:26.205
But there was an altercation and...

29:27.725 --> 29:30.285
Giuliano is being held
until the Priori convenes.

29:30.365 --> 29:33.205
See that he's being given
clean water and good food.

29:33.285 --> 29:36.005
We don't want him poisoned
like his grandfather.

29:38.445 --> 29:40.205
What else are you not telling me?

29:40.285 --> 29:42.325
It's what you haven't told us.
Lorenzo was accosted
in the street by merchants.

29:45.005 --> 29:47.285
They say you have recalled
dozens of loans.

29:50.925 --> 29:52.845
I was hoping to spare you both.

29:53.765 --> 29:55.925
The bank is overextended.

29:56.845 --> 29:58.285
But surely the Pope's tides...

29:58.365 --> 30:00.205
I have already borrowed
against the Pope's tides

30:00.285 --> 30:01.885
and still we come up short.

30:01.965 --> 30:03.685
But to take from those
who can least afford it--

30:03.765 --> 30:04.605
Lorenzo.

30:04.685 --> 30:06.245
As your grandfather said,

30:06.325 --> 30:08.605
"Sometimes, it is necessary to do some bad

30:08.685 --> 30:09.965
in order to do good."

30:10.565 --> 30:13.085
Their labor built this republic, Father.

30:14.245 --> 30:16.365
They turn against us
and we have got nothing.

30:16.445 --> 30:17.765
It's all right.

30:18.005 --> 30:20.325
I have come to an agreement with the duke.

30:21.485 --> 30:23.405
Sforza will repay his father's loan?

30:23.485 --> 30:24.565
Yes.

30:30.165 --> 30:31.765
Then I am greatly relieved.

30:33.125 --> 30:35.005
As am I.

30:56.765 --> 30:58.125
[bell tolling]

31:05.805 --> 31:06.765
[Bianca] Well?

31:07.005 --> 31:08.525
My brother provoked yours.

31:08.725 --> 31:10.325
He didn't mean to hurt my uncle.

31:10.925 --> 31:12.725
This is the last thing we needed.

31:13.685 --> 31:17.805
I think that I can prove that my uncle
didn't try to have your father killed.

31:18.925 --> 31:20.765
It would almost certainly
lessen the tensions

31:20.845 --> 31:21.965
between our families.

31:22.365 --> 31:23.325
Can you?
I might.

31:27.965 --> 31:28.845
You're brilliant.

31:36.445 --> 31:37.485
[thunder rumbling]

31:46.685 --> 31:47.925
Ground gold.

31:48.965 --> 31:51.245
My physician says it extends life.

31:55.925 --> 31:59.245
[indistinct conversation]

32:03.765 --> 32:05.965
...your young artist, Botticelli.

32:07.325 --> 32:09.685
I would like him to come
paint for me in Milan.

32:11.005 --> 32:15.005
Well, you may ask him, General,
but I very much doubt he will accept.

32:15.485 --> 32:17.445
Why not? I'd pay him well.

32:18.085 --> 32:19.605
Sandro was an orphan.

32:19.685 --> 32:22.805
We recognized his talent
and we raised him alongside our own sons.

32:23.005 --> 32:24.085
They're like brothers.

32:25.805 --> 32:28.325
You Medici have
strange ways of treating artists

32:29.365 --> 32:30.725
and repaying a favor.

32:31.725 --> 32:32.725
What favor?

32:34.485 --> 32:37.285
Your husband told you
of our arrangement, did he not?

32:37.365 --> 32:40.125
My husband merely told me
you were repaying a debt due.

32:41.525 --> 32:43.325
With something more precious
than money.

33:05.965 --> 33:07.405
I thought you weren't coming.

33:08.645 --> 33:09.845
Is your husband here?

33:10.165 --> 33:11.485
Out on business.

33:15.645 --> 33:17.045
Sorry about yesterday.

33:19.525 --> 33:21.125
Well, I have heard some

33:21.245 --> 33:24.765
shoddy excuses
for standing up a lover but...

33:25.485 --> 33:27.445
saving your father's life...

33:28.645 --> 33:31.405
You have to do better than "sorry".

33:32.965 --> 33:33.965
How is he?

33:34.925 --> 33:36.165
He is in pain.

33:36.285 --> 33:37.485
He's shaken.

33:38.565 --> 33:40.005
-But alive.
-Hmm.

33:41.725 --> 33:42.725
Were you hurt?

33:44.125 --> 33:44.965
No.

33:45.485 --> 33:46.525
[thunder rumbling]

33:46.605 --> 33:47.965
Not even a...

33:48.165 --> 33:50.885
slight ache... here.

33:52.525 --> 33:53.405
No.

33:54.525 --> 33:55.725
Not even here?

33:59.645 --> 34:00.565
No.

34:03.285 --> 34:04.485
What about here?

34:12.805 --> 34:13.724
No.

34:56.285 --> 34:58.845
What is that brilliant
mind of yours thinking?

35:01.005 --> 35:02.165
About...

35:03.685 --> 35:05.885
About whether it is necessary sometimes

35:06.965 --> 35:10.085
to do bad in order to do good.

35:11.685 --> 35:13.205
What do you mean by that?

35:15.925 --> 35:18.405
My father has struck a deal

35:18.765 --> 35:20.405
with the Duke of Milan.

35:20.485 --> 35:23.525
And I fear that times are more dire
than he said.

35:25.125 --> 35:26.445
So ask him.

35:28.845 --> 35:30.045
I can't.

35:30.205 --> 35:31.205
Why?

35:32.085 --> 35:33.685
He sees me as a boy.

35:35.885 --> 35:37.805
He's trying to shield me from the truth.

35:40.565 --> 35:42.405
But you are not a boy, Lorenzo.

35:42.485 --> 35:43.325
Ah.

35:44.565 --> 35:45.685
You're a man.

35:47.445 --> 35:49.525
An asset to your father,

35:50.085 --> 35:51.925
if only he could see it.

35:55.045 --> 35:56.925
So how do I help him?

35:57.565 --> 35:58.925
You'll find a way.
-Will I?
-Mm-hmm.

36:03.845 --> 36:05.165
[church bell tolling]

36:09.685 --> 36:11.125
Where are you going?

36:11.405 --> 36:13.005
Ah, we have to present our case

36:13.325 --> 36:16.005
against Jacopo Pazzi to the Priori.

36:27.005 --> 36:28.085
Wish me luck.

36:29.845 --> 36:31.645
[footsteps receding]

36:36.365 --> 36:39.085
The Medicis' have accused me
of hiring assassins

36:39.165 --> 36:40.965
and paying them with this

36:41.565 --> 36:42.725
gold medallion.

36:43.725 --> 36:47.725
But I can prove that this coin
did not belong to any assassin.

36:50.685 --> 36:53.925
Tell me, Messer Fanti,
do you recognize this?

36:54.205 --> 36:55.685
Yes, Signore.

36:55.885 --> 36:58.245
I told your nephew
it has my initials on it.

36:58.445 --> 36:59.485
A.F.

37:00.045 --> 37:01.125
Arturo Fanti.

37:01.205 --> 37:04.005
There must be
a thousand A.F's. in Tuscany.

37:04.085 --> 37:05.565
This one is bent.

37:05.645 --> 37:08.285
Put it on a flat surface, it will wobble.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.165
[crowd murmuring]

37:17.405 --> 37:20.445
You must have been very pleased
to receive it but you sold it.

37:21.045 --> 37:22.085
Because it's bent?

37:22.165 --> 37:23.765
Because it's gold.

37:24.605 --> 37:26.845
And the Medici recalled my loan last week.

37:27.285 --> 37:28.165
Did you?

37:29.765 --> 37:31.125
So the Medici case is,

37:31.285 --> 37:34.405
I or one of my nephews,

37:34.485 --> 37:36.365
paid a hired assassin

37:36.485 --> 37:38.965
with a second-hand medal
we bought in the market,

37:39.045 --> 37:41.965
rather than use any
of the untraceable gold in our bank.

37:42.045 --> 37:45.005
Only the Pazzi hate my father enough
to try to kill him.

37:45.125 --> 37:47.125
It is natural for a son

37:47.205 --> 37:49.285
to be blind to the faults of his father,

37:49.965 --> 37:51.085
and for that reason

37:51.165 --> 37:53.165
if Giuliano de' Medici apologizes,

37:54.405 --> 37:57.565
I am willing to forgive and forget
his slander

37:57.765 --> 37:58.685
and physical assault.
[crowd murmurs]

38:04.605 --> 38:05.765
Signor. [coughs]

38:05.845 --> 38:08.165
On behalf of the Medici,

38:09.045 --> 38:11.885
I apologize to the noble Pazzi family

38:11.965 --> 38:15.005
for my brother's... temperate reaction

38:15.085 --> 38:17.085
to the murderous attack on our father.

38:18.965 --> 38:22.205
We accept now that we were mistaken.

38:27.165 --> 38:29.765
I was hoping
your brother might speak for himself.

38:34.925 --> 38:36.205
Just say sorry.

38:36.685 --> 38:38.165
You don't have to mean it.

38:46.965 --> 38:48.285
Never mind.

38:49.405 --> 38:51.765
I will take his silence as an apology.

38:53.765 --> 38:57.125
I'd still like to know how that medallion
got into the assassin's room.

39:04.365 --> 39:05.645
Where are you going?

39:06.525 --> 39:07.685
I need some air.

39:07.765 --> 39:08.965
[Sorderini] Lorenzo.

39:11.805 --> 39:13.205
Everyone, go home.

39:13.725 --> 39:14.845
I'll meet you there.

39:19.365 --> 39:20.725
Messer Soderini.

39:23.645 --> 39:25.045
Tell him what you saw, son.

39:25.165 --> 39:26.045
[Bastiano] It's the Pazzi.

39:26.125 --> 39:28.565
They've been spreading word
the Medici are insolvent.

39:28.645 --> 39:30.045
-[crowd screaming]
-[man] Give us our money.

39:30.125 --> 39:31.965
Come back tomorrow.

39:32.565 --> 39:34.485
You'll all be paid tomorrow.

39:34.565 --> 39:37.925
[Bastiano]<i> With one hand,</i>
<i>they force a run on your bank</i>

39:38.005 --> 39:40.765
<i>and with the other,</i>
<i>they offer to assume the merchant's</i>

39:40.845 --> 39:43.125
<i>distressed credit at a discounted rate.</i>

39:43.685 --> 39:45.925
The Pazzi Bank will pay five lira
to the florin.

39:46.565 --> 39:49.165
It's not what the Medici Bank
promised you, of course.

39:49.485 --> 39:51.005
But it is cash in your hand,

39:51.925 --> 39:55.085
and more than you'll see from the Medici

39:55.205 --> 39:56.365
who are insolvent.

39:58.285 --> 40:00.965
[Bastiano]<i> They've acquired accounts</i>
<i>from dozens of merchants</i>

40:01.045 --> 40:02.325
<i>at a discounted rate,</i>

40:02.725 --> 40:05.525
<i>enriching their bank</i>
<i>while crippling yours.</i>

40:06.045 --> 40:09.085
If this continues,
you'll be bankrupt within days.

40:14.325 --> 40:15.565
[indistinct chatter]

40:28.965 --> 40:29.845
[whistling]

40:29.925 --> 40:30.885
Medici.

40:36.165 --> 40:39.405
You didn't find Fanti's medal
in that assassin's room.

40:40.005 --> 40:41.165
And if you did,

40:41.405 --> 40:43.125
it was you who put it there.

40:44.245 --> 40:45.565
I don't know how he did it,

40:47.365 --> 40:48.925
but it was your uncle who hired him.

40:49.325 --> 40:50.285
[Giuliano grunts]

40:53.685 --> 40:55.885
This just proves my point.

40:57.205 --> 40:58.125
Kill me now...

40:58.525 --> 41:01.205
then you'll be the first man
the Priori come looking for.

41:01.285 --> 41:02.765
[grunting]

41:14.805 --> 41:18.685
The streets are teaming with mobs
calling for Medici blood.

41:22.285 --> 41:26.365
Good luck inventing evidence to prove
I had anything to do with this.

41:29.525 --> 41:30.765
[grunting]

41:42.605 --> 41:43.685
[door opens]

41:44.805 --> 41:45.845
Giuliano.

41:48.645 --> 41:49.925
Fetch some towels and water.

41:52.485 --> 41:53.445
[grunts]

41:54.685 --> 41:55.725
Who did this to you?

41:56.325 --> 41:57.205
Pazzi.

41:58.165 --> 42:00.325
Francesco Pazzi.

42:00.405 --> 42:01.645
He will pay for this.

42:01.725 --> 42:04.125
Lorenzo, summon the Priori.
We must demand justice.

42:04.245 --> 42:05.765
[stick clanging]

42:09.365 --> 42:11.485
There will be no need for that,
will there, Father?

42:12.965 --> 42:14.365
Lorenzo, what do you mean?

42:15.005 --> 42:17.885
I mean, the duke is no longer
repaying the loan with money.

42:19.325 --> 42:21.765
The duke's men are outside the city walls.

42:22.245 --> 42:24.645
They will march on Florence at midnight.

42:24.725 --> 42:26.925
Those men will sack this city, Father.

42:27.645 --> 42:28.725
And you agreed to it.

42:28.805 --> 42:30.205
I know what they will do.

42:30.285 --> 42:31.805
-Father.
-No, you must not do this.

42:31.885 --> 42:33.365
What choice is there?

42:33.965 --> 42:35.285
Would you see us ruined

42:35.365 --> 42:39.325
and the Pazzi undo all the good
we've done for the people of Florence.

42:45.005 --> 42:45.845
Piero.

42:46.365 --> 42:47.245
Piero.

42:48.605 --> 42:52.445
I have loved and supported you
my entire life,

42:53.205 --> 42:54.285
but this...

42:55.365 --> 42:56.725
this you must not do.

42:56.885 --> 42:58.365
There is no choice.

42:58.445 --> 42:59.605
Oh, husband,

43:00.685 --> 43:02.085
there is always a choice.

43:02.165 --> 43:03.885
Only if you are prepared to lose.

43:04.565 --> 43:07.885
My father and his father before him
never were

43:08.805 --> 43:10.005
and neither am I.

43:34.605 --> 43:36.125
[horses whinnying]

43:46.365 --> 43:47.725
Now we ride!

43:48.485 --> 43:50.605
[shouting]

44:35.285 --> 44:37.325
[Contessina]<i> One day you will lead us...</i>

44:38.085 --> 44:39.165
<i>Does it scare you?</i>

44:40.205 --> 44:41.045
[Young Lorenzo]<i> A little.</i>

44:41.165 --> 44:42.445
[Contessina]<i> Let the fear drive you</i>

44:43.365 --> 44:44.805
<i>to work hard and prepare.</i>

44:45.885 --> 44:49.325
<i>So that when the time comes,</i>
<i>you'll be ready.</i>

45:18.205 --> 45:19.205
Lorenzo.

45:24.885 --> 45:26.045
Are you all right?

45:28.725 --> 45:31.445
Send messengers to summon
the members of the Priori.

45:32.565 --> 45:33.405
Here?
Yes.

45:58.165 --> 45:59.085
[bell tolling]

46:02.685 --> 46:03.525
Lorenzo.

46:05.085 --> 46:06.205
What's the meaning of this?

46:08.685 --> 46:10.965
Yes, young Medici.

46:11.205 --> 46:13.725
What's your business
with the Priori this time?

46:14.485 --> 46:16.565
Not more baseless charges, I hope.

46:18.845 --> 46:21.245
I have called you here to save Florence.

46:23.365 --> 46:24.845
We didn't know it needed saving.

46:32.445 --> 46:33.565
You are aware

46:34.685 --> 46:37.485
that my father has called in debts

46:37.565 --> 46:39.765
to cover a loan that he made
to the duke of Milan's father.

46:41.405 --> 46:43.965
And that ordinary citizens are suffering

46:44.125 --> 46:45.885
and that they're rightly angry.

46:48.885 --> 46:52.045
Now the duke intends to repay his debt
by unleashing an army

46:52.125 --> 46:53.125
on our people.

46:56.845 --> 46:58.285
This is deeply troubling, Lorenzo.

46:59.645 --> 47:01.405
Why are you telling us this?

47:01.845 --> 47:03.205
Because my father...

47:04.565 --> 47:07.925
He's a good... And he is an honorable man.

47:09.485 --> 47:11.365
But he is no longer the head of this bank.

47:12.885 --> 47:15.485
But that's ridiculous. Who removed him?

47:15.565 --> 47:16.445
I am going to.

47:18.525 --> 47:19.365
Right now,

47:20.365 --> 47:24.925
provided the restricted council
agree to give me his seat in the Signoria.

47:25.005 --> 47:28.765
Or the duke's men
will overrun our city, is that right?

47:29.005 --> 47:32.285
I will cancel the loan recalls
that my father has issued

47:32.365 --> 47:34.565
and I will send the duke back to Milan.

47:35.245 --> 47:37.485
You stab your own father in the back.

47:38.405 --> 47:39.765
Why should we trust you?

47:40.565 --> 47:41.565
You trust me...

47:43.365 --> 47:46.685
because your nephew attacked my brother
in the street today.

47:47.005 --> 47:49.045
Oh, no. That sounds familiar.

47:49.845 --> 47:51.005
[Lorenzo] You trust me...

47:51.565 --> 47:52.885
because I forgive him.

47:54.325 --> 47:55.885
Because maybe my brother

47:55.965 --> 47:59.445
unjustly accused your family of being
behind the plot to kill my father.

48:00.885 --> 48:03.725
And perhaps,
Francesco felt that he had to retaliate.

48:05.325 --> 48:06.805
Well, I forgive him.

48:08.805 --> 48:12.925
Because this settling of old scores
has never settled anything.

48:15.005 --> 48:18.685
We have to put our feuds
behind us, gentlemen.

48:20.285 --> 48:21.245
To do good,

48:21.925 --> 48:23.285
we have to be good.

48:25.845 --> 48:27.125
For the future of Florence.

48:29.245 --> 48:31.085
For the future of us all.

48:37.445 --> 48:38.285
A vote.

48:41.125 --> 48:42.485
[Sforza] Open these gates.

48:42.965 --> 48:45.445
Open them or my men
will smash through them

48:45.525 --> 48:46.885
and carry your heads on pikes.

48:49.765 --> 48:50.805
All in favor?

49:28.005 --> 49:28.885
[man] Aah.

49:30.645 --> 49:31.605
[men shouting]

49:38.285 --> 49:40.285
Lorenzo, debts don't just go away.

49:40.525 --> 49:42.165
They have to be accounted for.

49:42.845 --> 49:43.885
I understand.

49:44.325 --> 49:45.805
I have an offer.

49:46.485 --> 49:47.405
An alliance,

49:47.485 --> 49:49.845
between your family's bank and mine.

49:50.285 --> 49:52.365
Forged in marriage.

49:52.685 --> 49:56.005
Your sister Bianca and my son Bastiano.

49:56.765 --> 49:59.005
He's always had a great affection for her.

49:59.925 --> 50:00.805
Have you?

50:03.245 --> 50:04.405
You have a deal.

50:14.245 --> 50:15.205
[guard] Forward!

50:15.725 --> 50:16.645
Up!

50:34.005 --> 50:35.445
Stop your men, Duke.

50:37.005 --> 50:38.765
Out of our way, Lorenzo.

50:38.925 --> 50:40.965
We have an understanding with your father.

50:42.125 --> 50:43.685
I am now the head of the bank,

50:44.285 --> 50:46.245
and your presence here is illegal.

50:46.965 --> 50:49.805
You brand me a criminal
and then expect me to retreat.

50:51.285 --> 50:53.365
Well if you do, I will write a letter,

50:54.245 --> 50:57.405
saying that I implored you
to protect this city,

50:57.925 --> 51:00.405
and that you stayed your hand
at my request.

51:01.805 --> 51:03.445
You will be seen as a hero...

51:04.325 --> 51:05.325
not as a criminal.

51:05.645 --> 51:06.925
And my father's debt?

51:07.125 --> 51:08.765
It remains unpaid,

51:08.965 --> 51:11.245
while your control of the city crumbles.
I will find another way to save this bank

51:15.525 --> 51:16.525
and this city.

[horses neighing]

51:29.765 --> 51:30.805
A shame.

51:32.125 --> 51:33.765
I was greatly looking forward to this.

51:36.805 --> 51:38.645
But it's your grave, Medici.

51:40.205 --> 51:41.525
Good luck.

51:43.365 --> 51:44.245
[man shouting]

51:55.365 --> 51:56.565
[Sandro] You did it.

51:57.005 --> 51:58.365
You saved Florence.

51:58.845 --> 52:01.485
Without so much as raising your sword.

52:03.365 --> 52:04.885
I destroyed my father

52:06.205 --> 52:08.765
and compelled the Priori to act from fear.

52:10.285 --> 52:13.165
Our enemies will come at us
from all sides now.
