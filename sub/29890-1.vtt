[horse snorts]

01:48.409 --> 01:51.510
[men conversing softly]

01:57.785 --> 01:59.651
Tillery's on his way back.

02:01.655 --> 02:04.189
-He's got the basket?
-As usual.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.559
We're doing this.

02:09.763 --> 02:10.762
Lyman.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.668
Lyman. Are you good?

02:17.505 --> 02:19.471
[coughing]

02:50.371 --> 02:51.803
[horse snorts]

03:03.184 --> 03:06.185
[footsteps]

03:07.655 --> 03:09.288
[whispering]
What about Doniphan?

03:09.290 --> 03:11.323
-He'll leave.
-And if he doesn't?

03:11.325 --> 03:13.192
You think
he wants to eat with us?

03:14.662 --> 03:17.429
Tonight is the night.

03:17.431 --> 03:18.797
We all agreed on it.

03:19.934 --> 03:21.800
Even Joseph.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.802
[Alexander McRae]
We all prayed about it.

03:25.206 --> 03:26.538
Not all of us.

03:29.376 --> 03:30.809
I don't need to pray

03:30.811 --> 03:32.844
to know that I should leave
this wretched jail.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.647
[Lyman coughs]

03:37.218 --> 03:38.684
You can do this, Lyman.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.255
[door creaking]

03:43.257 --> 03:45.424
[Joseph Smith] We need you
to petition the state

03:45.426 --> 03:46.625
for another court of inquiry.

03:46.627 --> 03:48.293
They won't hear it.

03:48.295 --> 03:51.630
We need to find a judge
who will hear our case.

03:51.632 --> 03:53.665
One that isn't biased
against our people.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.267
Joseph, that's not likely.

03:56.403 --> 03:57.636
General Doniphan,

03:58.839 --> 04:00.872
the Saints are being driven
from their homes.

04:01.909 --> 04:03.675
Governor Boggs'
extermination order

04:03.677 --> 04:06.445
is being seen by many
as justification

04:06.447 --> 04:09.681
for the increased hostility
towards our people.

04:12.720 --> 04:15.821
They're ransoming their property
to the state

04:15.823 --> 04:17.822
in exchange for their lives.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.259
They have nothing left.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.728
Not a lot of people
are for you right now.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.869
Emma will be leaving
for Quincy soon.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.740
We need to be with them.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.978
You have to convince
the state to release us.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.313
That's unlikely.

04:45.419 --> 04:48.654
This was printed last week
in the "Missouri Republican".

04:53.761 --> 04:55.794
What is taking so long?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.396
Joseph knows we're ready.

04:58.499 --> 04:59.831
Another minute won't kill you.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.833
If we could be so lucky.

05:03.437 --> 05:06.905
"The situation with the Saints
grows increasingly difficult.

05:08.442 --> 05:09.975
Being forced from their homes,

05:09.977 --> 05:13.445
they are generally poor,
facing starvation, destitute.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.848
As leaders push
their writ of habeas corpus,

05:16.850 --> 05:18.717
questions arise
about the legality

05:18.719 --> 05:20.852
of their imprisonment
in Liberty."

05:20.854 --> 05:22.888
That's enough.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.656
Enough?

05:24.658 --> 05:25.924
This type of awareness

05:25.926 --> 05:27.893
has the potential
to change opinions.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.096
Opinions are not truth.

05:33.334 --> 05:34.800
I need you down.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.770
[groans]

05:38.772 --> 05:40.105
You're not gonna let them up?

05:40.107 --> 05:42.007
After I have a word
with your attorney.

05:55.522 --> 05:57.456
-Are we not--
-Shh, shh.

06:00.894 --> 06:04.763
General, these men
are being held for treason.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.431
I can't tolerate plotting

06:06.433 --> 06:08.066
against the leaders and laws
of this state.

06:08.068 --> 06:10.402
Nobody's plotting
against the state.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.904
My clients have been here
for two months.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.773
It's okay to help them
out a little.

06:14.775 --> 06:17.109
Doniphan's filing the petition.

06:17.111 --> 06:19.511
-What's the timeline?
-Nothing yet.

06:20.581 --> 06:21.780
So we wait?

06:21.782 --> 06:23.382
No, it's not worth it.

06:23.384 --> 06:25.517
We will never get
anything fair here.

06:25.519 --> 06:27.386
Not in northern Missouri
at least.

06:27.388 --> 06:30.789
I will not spend another night
in this wretched pit.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.958
There's been
no ruling on the charges.

06:32.960 --> 06:35.894
Don't be quick to judge.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.796
The state's not holding them
for no reason.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.432
Treason and murder.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.601
[Doniphan]
I've heard the accusations.

06:42.603 --> 06:43.869
These ain't light charges.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.505
-You been studying law, Sam?
-Some.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.076
And if half the charges
against these men are true,

06:51.078 --> 06:53.912
they are the most scurrilous,
degenerate men

06:53.914 --> 06:55.414
in all of Missouri.

06:55.416 --> 06:56.748
And if half are untrue?

06:56.750 --> 06:58.150
If half of them are lies?

06:59.153 --> 07:00.986
What does that say
about the men

07:00.988 --> 07:04.055
who falsely accused them
or rushed to judgment?

07:06.994 --> 07:09.461
Are you well enough
to make it to the brush?

07:11.565 --> 07:12.931
I don't know.

07:14.034 --> 07:16.134
We're not gonna
leave you behind.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.771
-[Lyman coughs]
-Since you brought it up,

07:19.773 --> 07:21.606
you've got a commission
from the state

07:21.608 --> 07:22.641
to take care of these men.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.209
I treat 'em right.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.977
What's that
you're feeding them?

07:25.979 --> 07:27.212
They get what they need.

07:27.214 --> 07:30.182
They get visitors,
they get letters.

07:30.184 --> 07:32.517
Sheriff Hadley
knows I keep a good watch.

07:32.519 --> 07:35.120
Sheriff Hadley knows the stories
like the one in the Republican

07:35.122 --> 07:36.922
are gonna stir things up
for you here.

07:36.924 --> 07:38.490
He trusts me.

07:38.492 --> 07:40.459
Is that who you're trying
to impress?

07:40.461 --> 07:43.895
Sheriff Hadley?
Trying to become deputy?

07:43.897 --> 07:45.997
A lot of people
want to see my clients dead.

07:45.999 --> 07:47.999
Seems keeping them safe inside
is a good thing

07:48.001 --> 07:50.001
till things settle down.

07:50.003 --> 07:52.204
You've got the most hated men
in Missouri in there,

07:52.206 --> 07:54.105
a governor who wants
to wash his hands of them,

07:54.107 --> 07:56.741
and a press that's happy
to confuse the issue

07:56.743 --> 07:58.944
as long as they keep
selling papers.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.812
And you think things
will settle down?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.183
Just get them better food, Sam.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.956
Lyman, you follow me up.

08:10.958 --> 08:14.559
Alexander, you come up next.

08:14.561 --> 08:17.162
Be sure to block
Tillery's sightline.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.531
We quietly make our way
out the door.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.500
You come last.

08:21.502 --> 08:22.934
Then we lock him in.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.603
Be sure to get the keys.

08:24.605 --> 08:26.705
-They'll be by his books.
-How do you know that?

08:26.707 --> 08:29.541
-Because that's
where he puts them.
-[trapdoor thuds]

08:31.044 --> 08:33.044
[Sam]
Come up. Stay together.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.948
[suspenseful theme playing]

08:42.623 --> 08:44.789
Just get to the door.
I'll take it from there.

[Hyrum Smith] Block Tillery.

08:47.628 --> 08:50.228
You stick with me.
I'll get us out of here.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.607
Help-- Help me.

09:05.178 --> 09:08.079

I can't. I can't do this.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.668
[Joseph] Hyrum?

09:32.773 --> 09:35.073
[Sam] Food not good enough
for you?

09:37.010 --> 09:38.710
[Alexander]
Has it ever been?

10:13.614 --> 10:16.114
[vomiting]

10:16.883 --> 10:19.250
I can't make it.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.654
You take one more step,

10:22.656 --> 10:24.356
you'll make
a Missouri hero out of me.

10:27.628 --> 10:28.960
[Joseph] Sam.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.763
We just need you
to listen to us.

10:31.765 --> 10:32.998
[Sam] You listen to me.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.066
[sighs] That's it.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.637
[vomiting]

10:43.844 --> 10:46.678
We'll force our way out
the next time we're up there.

10:48.682 --> 10:50.915
And if that doesn't work?

10:50.917 --> 10:53.318
Then we'll try every day
after that until we're free.

10:53.320 --> 10:56.321
If you really want to know
how we got here,

10:56.323 --> 10:58.923
start-start...

10:58.925 --> 11:00.191
start back
from the beginning.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.260
You best pull yourself together.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.196
Before we all die in here.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.132
[Sidney Rigdon]
Independence, Missouri.

[soft theme playing]

11:17.811 --> 11:19.277
[sighs]

11:34.828 --> 11:36.294
Leaving late tonight, Sam?

11:38.131 --> 11:40.398
Tell your friends to stop
pestering these men, Neil.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.701
[Neil] I don't control
what everyone does.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.271
There's a lot
of angry men about.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.907
I'll be sure
to keep the door locked.

11:48.909 --> 11:51.876
How long you gonna keep
protecting them, Sam?

11:51.878 --> 11:55.280
It's four feet of rock and
timber that's protecting them.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.816
Has nothing to do with me.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.718
I don't got a key.

11:59.720 --> 12:02.353
-You got a key, Neil?
-Comes with the job, Parker.

12:03.824 --> 12:07.058
You want yours back?
I hear the state's hiring.

12:07.060 --> 12:12.097
Listen, we want justice
just like you.

12:12.099 --> 12:15.266
There comes a time when you
can't just sit there
and do nothing.

12:16.303 --> 12:18.470
People got to pay
for their crimes,

12:18.472 --> 12:20.839
and them turning
the legal system against itself,

12:20.841 --> 12:23.274
that only hurts
the good people of Missouri.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.812
You're letting the Mormons
make a fool of you.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.149
You're sitting in there
with them,

12:32.185 --> 12:33.785
reading from your book.

12:35.489 --> 12:37.756
Bringing them food

12:37.758 --> 12:39.190
in your little bucket.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.229
Your time here...

12:46.066 --> 12:48.366
it ain't gonna make up
for what you've done.

12:51.037 --> 12:53.204
Stop pestering these men, Neil.

12:57.811 --> 12:59.310
Let the law handle it.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.315
It's not for you or for me
to interfere.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.056
[horse walking]

13:12.058 --> 13:13.391
[Neil] Sam Tillery.

13:14.461 --> 13:17.796
The traitorous captain
of Liberty Jail.

13:17.798 --> 13:20.398
Running from a fight
like he done in the war.

13:23.036 --> 13:24.502
Don't you worry!

13:24.504 --> 13:26.070
We'll keep an eye
on Liberty for you.

13:26.072 --> 13:27.338
[rock pelts door]

13:27.340 --> 13:29.874
[Sam] Liberty will be fine
without you.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.376
[rock thuds]

13:39.452 --> 13:43.354
[Sam] The Mormons showed up
on our side of the river,

13:43.356 --> 13:46.925
well, maybe seven years ago.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.995
Refugees from a war
they got themselves into

13:50.997 --> 13:52.897
down in Jackson County.

13:54.534 --> 13:58.369
The leaders, they were
transferred here a month ago

13:58.371 --> 13:59.971
from the jail in Richmond.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.439
And y'all are here to help

14:01.441 --> 14:03.374
with the attention
that they're bringing.

14:04.110 --> 14:05.243
Joe Smith,

14:05.245 --> 14:06.611
the leader of the Mormons,

14:06.613 --> 14:09.180
in Clay County Jail
right here in Liberty.

14:09.883 --> 14:11.316
You get to talk to him?

14:14.521 --> 14:16.888
He tell you
about that gold Bible he got?

14:16.890 --> 14:18.456
I haven't asked him to.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.158
You reckon it's true
how he got it?

14:20.160 --> 14:21.926
None of my concern.

14:24.464 --> 14:25.964
Joe Smith.

14:25.966 --> 14:27.131
Oh, hold up.

14:27.133 --> 14:30.001
[suspenseful theme]

14:36.009 --> 14:37.075
[John Brasswell]
Who is it?

14:37.077 --> 14:38.509
[Sam] I don't know.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.512
[James Ford]
What do we got here?

14:43.183 --> 14:45.149
-Cyrus, get back.
-What is it?

14:45.151 --> 14:46.517
Shh!

14:48.588 --> 14:50.889
There ain't nothing
for you here!

14:52.659 --> 14:54.025
Hold up.

14:56.329 --> 14:59.364
Porter? That you?

15:02.302 --> 15:03.935
He's a friend of theirs.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.507
Porter, put it down.

15:18.184 --> 15:19.951
They still got friends?

15:24.591 --> 15:26.457
[Porter]
Pretty quick on the draw, Sam.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.693
Just protecting my jail.

15:28.695 --> 15:31.195
Who were you jumping
to shoot so bad?

15:31.197 --> 15:34.666
Just a couple of locals
making threats, that's all.

15:34.668 --> 15:36.367
Say they're gonna kill
my prisoners

15:36.369 --> 15:38.336
before the lawyers
can set 'em free.

15:40.073 --> 15:41.539
That sounds more
than a threat.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.608
I haven't seen you two before.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.610
Old Porter and I, we've been
here quite a few times,

15:45.612 --> 15:47.345
getting letters
from the prisoners,

15:47.347 --> 15:49.180
taking them to the Saints.

15:49.182 --> 15:50.481
They stirring up trouble
for you?

15:50.483 --> 15:52.550
Protecting the prophet?

15:52.552 --> 15:55.653
My job is to keep the prisoners
till justice can run its course.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.022
Ain't got nothing to do
with religion.

15:58.024 --> 16:00.525
Course it's hard to find
the Saints to give them
their letters

16:00.527 --> 16:03.361
because they're all
so displaced, you know.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.629
We caught up
with Brother McRae's kids

16:04.631 --> 16:06.497
just the other day,
and his wife.

16:06.499 --> 16:09.100
They were all there.
Fact, there was 11 of 'em.

16:09.102 --> 16:10.601
You know he has ten daughters?

16:10.603 --> 16:12.603
They were taken
from their homes-- not fair.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.238
They ain't got no place to go.

16:14.240 --> 16:15.707
And now here we are,
here in this,

16:15.709 --> 16:17.675
you know, whatever
we want to call this place.

16:17.677 --> 16:20.278
-Thick walls.
-[Sam] It's a jail.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.246
[Cyrus Daniels]
Absolutely.

16:22.248 --> 16:24.282
Yeah, this a jail
if I ever saw one.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.750
I'm gonna need your weapon.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.552
[Cyrus] Yeah,
once these men are released,

16:27.554 --> 16:29.387
we're gonna take them
to the Mississippi

16:29.389 --> 16:31.222
to meet up with the Saints.

16:31.224 --> 16:34.058
It's gonna be a reunition
like ain't nobody ever seen.

16:34.060 --> 16:36.327
Maybe you'll be there.
I don't know.

16:37.263 --> 16:38.596
Whoa!

16:38.598 --> 16:40.698
[Alexander]
Time to change the bucket.

16:40.700 --> 16:42.133
[men groaning]

16:42.135 --> 16:43.568
Smells a lot like you, Porter.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.104
I ain't touching it.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.472
Now bring it up with you.

16:48.408 --> 16:50.008
[laughing]

16:50.010 --> 16:52.210
That one got them.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.711
[whispering]
Okay, okay, listen.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.047
This is it.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.615
Just look to me.

16:57.617 --> 17:02.453
As soon as he leaves the door,
we make our move.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.390
Lyman, you good?

17:05.392 --> 17:07.392
I'll make it work.

17:07.394 --> 17:10.161
-[coughs]
-Attack at the door.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.696
As soon as you're through,
head for cover.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.601
Alexander, make sure--

17:16.603 --> 17:18.803
[Caleb]
He's got it. He's got it.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.673
-Sidney.
-Hyrum.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.377
[Hyrum] Joseph.

17:26.378 --> 17:28.512
Just don't make
any sudden moves.

17:29.315 --> 17:32.517
[quiet laughter]

17:35.321 --> 17:37.188
For God and Liberty.

17:37.190 --> 17:39.390
[men] For God and Liberty.

17:45.532 --> 17:47.698
[straining] Thank you.

17:49.836 --> 17:51.402
Brother Cyrus.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.604
Brother Joseph.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.406
We almost brought you
some supplies, but we--

17:55.408 --> 17:57.108
Brother Porter.

17:59.813 --> 18:01.212
Be ready.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.685
Gentlemen, Joseph Smith.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.189
Figured you'd be taller.

18:11.191 --> 18:14.759
[chuckles] There's a lot
of stories out there.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.694
That's typical for a con man.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.730
Friends of yours, Sam?

18:19.732 --> 18:22.100
[Sam] John Brassfield.
James Ford.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.435
State sent some help. Ugh.

18:29.242 --> 18:30.708
Take it out.

18:34.380 --> 18:35.713
I'll do it.

18:38.785 --> 18:41.586
[suspenseful theme playing]

18:44.657 --> 18:45.857
Go on.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.802
That's far enough.

19:11.217 --> 19:12.617
Please, Lord.

19:13.620 --> 19:15.253
Let this be right.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.867
I hear y'all are trying
for a new trial.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.769
I think that's a great idea.

19:31.771 --> 19:34.472
The more people this case
can get in front of the better.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.741
-If you guys can--
-Cyrus. Just...

19:39.279 --> 19:40.678
Mind if we sit?

19:49.856 --> 19:52.190
[Alexander] One of you
gonna be here at night?

19:52.192 --> 19:55.593
Take care of the degenerates
yelling in the window all night?

19:56.329 --> 19:57.862
That not your job?

19:59.332 --> 20:01.933
They say they're gonna kill us
before the hearing.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.804
Any of you bring
any kind of food, something?

20:07.607 --> 20:09.473
-No.
-No?

20:09.475 --> 20:10.875
[Caleb] How about you?

20:16.616 --> 20:17.982
Good thing the state
sent in more help.

20:17.984 --> 20:20.284
-Mm-hmm.
-Treating us like animals.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.786
You have an hour.

20:22.989 --> 20:26.224
-Don't hurry back.
-[door creaks]

20:39.539 --> 20:40.972
Now!

20:42.242 --> 20:43.708
Go, go, go, go!

20:44.877 --> 20:46.510
Push! Push!

20:46.512 --> 20:48.446
-Push!
-Push, Caleb!

20:48.448 --> 20:50.314
[men shouting]

20:50.316 --> 20:52.917
-Don't let him close the door!
-Push! Push!

20:52.919 --> 20:54.285
Come on! Come on!

20:54.287 --> 20:56.254
[Hyrum] Cyrus, push!

20:56.256 --> 20:57.855
Get the keys!

21:00.326 --> 21:01.792
My keys!

21:05.632 --> 21:07.365
-Get the gun!
-I got it! I got it!

21:07.367 --> 21:09.333
[men] Push!

21:10.270 --> 21:12.270
[Hyrum]
Get the gun! Get the gun!

21:13.673 --> 21:15.373
Aah! Aah, my hand!

21:16.042 --> 21:17.608
Get the Gun!

21:19.279 --> 21:20.544
Push!

21:20.546 --> 21:23.314
[men shouting]

21:23.316 --> 21:25.349
[grunting]

21:40.700 --> 21:42.800
[Sidney]
They shot him! They shot him!

21:42.802 --> 21:43.834
They're gonna kill us!

21:43.836 --> 21:45.970
They're gonna kill us!

21:51.344 --> 21:53.978
All prisoners
down in the hole! Now!

21:55.048 --> 21:58.716
Anyone still up,
I'll put you in irons.

22:01.454 --> 22:02.620
Joseph!

22:02.622 --> 22:04.388
Is Porter's gun put away?

22:11.931 --> 22:13.097
It is!

22:14.934 --> 22:16.467
John?

22:16.469 --> 22:17.501
[John] We're good!

22:17.503 --> 22:19.970
[unlocking door]

22:23.576 --> 22:24.742
[exhales]

22:24.744 --> 22:26.577
[James]
I see you breathing.

22:26.579 --> 22:27.945
Roll over.

22:29.482 --> 22:30.981
No, please. Don't.

22:33.619 --> 22:35.720
You ain't so talkative now, huh?

22:37.824 --> 22:39.023
[Hyrum] Cyrus is up.

22:39.025 --> 22:40.424
He's okay.

22:41.361 --> 22:42.693
He's okay.

22:49.769 --> 22:51.469
Open up in there!

22:57.043 --> 22:59.443
Let the sheriff know
we're holding two more.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.785
[trapdoor thuds]

23:24.036 --> 23:25.136
[Sam] Next.

23:26.606 --> 23:29.440
It's pointless and wasteful
to chain anyone else.

23:30.476 --> 23:32.009
We're not going anywhere.

23:33.479 --> 23:34.879
And if we were to try,

23:34.881 --> 23:37.548
we certainly wouldn't leave
anyone behind.

23:37.550 --> 23:40.751
Since when would the state
make any logical decisions?

23:40.753 --> 23:42.486
That's enough about the state.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.489
Next.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.162
What company were you in?

23:55.535 --> 23:58.502
I can always tell
when a man has seen battle.

23:59.705 --> 24:01.472
It don't matter.

24:01.474 --> 24:02.940
You a Marine?

24:04.977 --> 24:07.878
You want out of here,
you get out by the law.

24:08.848 --> 24:12.883
And I will stop any man,
veteran or not,

24:12.885 --> 24:14.785
who tries otherwise.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.188
Next.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.085
[Cyrus] You plan on keeping us
here all night?

24:49.622 --> 24:51.522
[Sam] They'll come for you
when they can.

24:53.893 --> 24:55.826
Well, we gotta eat something.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.062
[James] No, you don't.

24:58.064 --> 25:00.498
[Cyrus] That's unlawful.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.634
[James] Coming from the fool
who tried to attack me today.

25:06.005 --> 25:09.006
[distant thunder rumbling]

25:10.610 --> 25:12.843
You know, those men
you got down there?

25:14.013 --> 25:16.146
The ones you say
is breaking the law?

25:18.918 --> 25:20.618
You know
they're innocent, right?

25:27.560 --> 25:30.995
People saying things
about them just to get a rise.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.569
Before you know it,
you don't know what to believe.

25:38.571 --> 25:40.871
[dramatic theme playing]

25:42.208 --> 25:44.942
What's truth, what's lies.

25:45.811 --> 25:47.177
What's in between.

25:51.751 --> 25:52.917
Enough confusion
surrounds a man,

25:52.919 --> 25:54.652
he becomes a threat.

25:57.957 --> 26:01.125
Pretty soon,
you begin to hate him

26:01.127 --> 26:03.160
without really even knowing why.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.633
And then you're blinded
by that hate.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.070
[distant thunder rumbling]

26:13.072 --> 26:15.072
And the truth don't matter none.

26:20.580 --> 26:22.913
You know that man down there,
Joseph Smith?

26:26.686 --> 26:28.319
Why do people hate him so bad?

26:30.656 --> 26:34.224
What'd he do to earn the disdain
of men from here to New York?

26:37.330 --> 26:41.332
Where they curse his name
just at the sound of it.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.171
What'd he do, hmm?

26:48.274 --> 26:49.673
Print a book?

26:51.844 --> 26:53.210
Form a church?

26:55.081 --> 26:56.814
Build a city?

26:56.816 --> 26:58.949
No, I'll tell you what he did.

27:01.854 --> 27:05.022
That man you got chained up
down there like an animal...

27:08.361 --> 27:11.996
so everybody in Missouri
can let their hate fester?

27:14.700 --> 27:16.333
That man saw God.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.206
He communed
with the almighty Jehovah,

27:22.208 --> 27:24.708
just like Moses and Isaiah
before him.

27:29.382 --> 27:31.715
What, you think
he's the first prophet of God

27:31.717 --> 27:33.684
to be locked up? Hmm?

27:33.686 --> 27:35.052
Falsely accused?

27:36.055 --> 27:37.388
It's a pattern.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.792
People don't like
being told what to do,

27:41.794 --> 27:43.260
especially from men of God.

27:49.702 --> 27:51.135
So you cast him out.

27:53.439 --> 27:54.805
You beat him.

27:56.809 --> 27:58.242
You stone him.

27:58.244 --> 28:03.213
You curse him, you strip him,
you starve him, you spit on him,

28:03.215 --> 28:05.749
you do every unthinkable thing.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.458
And that fuels your hate.

28:16.829 --> 28:18.328
That fuels your hate.

28:27.740 --> 28:29.106
No matter.

28:31.711 --> 28:33.977
God proves his prophets.

28:33.979 --> 28:35.312
He'll prove this one...

28:38.484 --> 28:40.818
and he'll make sure
you know about it.

28:42.154 --> 28:44.221
In this life or the next.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.426
[men shouting outside]

28:49.428 --> 28:51.295
[Neil]
Tillery, you in there?!

28:54.467 --> 28:58.001
Come on, Sam!
You want a trial?!

28:58.003 --> 28:59.203
Well, we've got a jury!

28:59.205 --> 29:01.205
We're ready, Sam!

29:03.309 --> 29:04.975
Get away from there,
they'll see you!

29:04.977 --> 29:06.076
[Neil]
Tonight's the night!

29:06.078 --> 29:07.377
[man]
You make me sick!

29:07.379 --> 29:09.079
[Neil] Bring 'em out!

29:10.950 --> 29:12.316
Come on, Sam!

29:16.489 --> 29:18.856
Bring 'em out.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.257
Or this place goes up.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.527
What are you doing, Neil?

29:23.529 --> 29:26.830
Your deputy said they tried
to make an escape.

29:26.832 --> 29:28.065
Get out of the way, Sam!

29:28.067 --> 29:31.301
Go on home
to your wife and kids.

29:31.303 --> 29:33.237
My family knows where I am.

29:34.039 --> 29:35.839
Does yours, Ben Miller?

29:37.376 --> 29:40.778
We told you
things would get worse for you.

29:40.780 --> 29:42.446
Hold up there.

29:42.448 --> 29:46.183
Sam, Missouri has served us up
an opportunity

29:46.185 --> 29:48.352
to punish these men
for what they've done.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.821
They broke the law.

29:53.125 --> 29:54.792
New order.

29:54.794 --> 29:56.059
Says to get rid of them.

29:56.061 --> 29:58.462
What are you saying to do, Neil?

29:58.464 --> 30:01.899
Joe Smith killed my brother
at Crooked River.

30:04.036 --> 30:05.869
I'm sorry, Sam.

30:07.306 --> 30:11.542
But justice got
to be served today.

30:11.544 --> 30:15.312
-[thunder rumbling]
-Let's go!

30:15.314 --> 30:20.350
The right to punishing crime,
like murder,

30:20.352 --> 30:23.821
is, in a state of nature,
vested in each individual.

30:25.024 --> 30:28.492
But, in a state of society,

30:28.494 --> 30:31.962
that right is transferred
from the individuals

30:31.964 --> 30:33.263
to the sovereign power.

30:33.265 --> 30:37.234
As such, preventing men
from being judges

30:37.236 --> 30:39.269
in their own causes.

30:40.105 --> 30:41.405
You learn that from your book?

30:41.407 --> 30:42.973
I did.

30:44.510 --> 30:45.943
Yeah. Well...

30:47.413 --> 30:49.613
that's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

30:49.615 --> 30:53.450
[laughter]

30:53.452 --> 30:58.188
Listen, Sam, I don't want you
to get hurt in this.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.391
But I'm not going
to let these men escape.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.460
That's close enough.

31:04.563 --> 31:08.432
These men are
an infection in the state!

31:08.434 --> 31:10.133
It's time to burn 'em out!

31:10.135 --> 31:12.502
[cheering]

31:13.539 --> 31:14.972
No!

31:14.974 --> 31:16.006
I don't want them over here!

31:16.008 --> 31:17.007
[man] Here you go!

31:17.009 --> 31:18.876
Fire!

31:18.878 --> 31:20.477
[alarmed shouts]

31:22.281 --> 31:23.981
-[Alexander] Hey!
-[pounding]

31:23.983 --> 31:26.016
Bring a gun down here!

31:26.018 --> 31:28.418
-Hey, where you going?!
-I don't know.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.920
[grunts]

31:32.324 --> 31:34.024
Are we gonna die tonight?

31:34.026 --> 31:36.026
They got a guard
with a gun in their dungeon.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.961
Just let 'em out, Sam.

31:39.198 --> 31:40.530
Now, I don't have
a whole lot of say

31:40.532 --> 31:42.900
on what you raise out here.

31:42.902 --> 31:48.038
But if you or any of your men
interfere with my job

31:48.040 --> 31:49.606
to keep these men jailed,

31:51.610 --> 31:54.378
I'll put a bullet in your head.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.015
Now get your foot

31:59.184 --> 32:01.585
off my jail.

32:01.587 --> 32:03.620
Got some fight
in you after all.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.526
It's up to you, Neil.

32:11.196 --> 32:13.063
How do you want this to end?

32:15.200 --> 32:16.934
-[gunshot]
-[horses whinnying]

32:21.073 --> 32:22.572
Evening, gentlemen.

32:24.410 --> 32:26.376
Are we having a meeting
I don't know about?

32:26.378 --> 32:30.547
Sheriff, we were just coming
to check up on Sam.

32:31.951 --> 32:34.184
Heard something about
the prisoners trying to escape.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.452
[Sam] These men
were just leaving.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.322
Ah. Leaving now, huh?

32:39.658 --> 32:42.726
Gentlemen, Sam Tillery here
may like it

32:42.728 --> 32:46.330
when his friends stop by
and visit him each night,

32:46.332 --> 32:47.664
but as Justice of the Peace,

32:47.666 --> 32:50.067
I'm afraid I can't have that.

32:50.069 --> 32:51.501
Man has a job to do.

32:53.005 --> 32:54.304
And you're interfering.

32:54.306 --> 32:57.541
So, uh, why don't you
go on home

32:59.645 --> 33:02.079
and give my jailer a break,

33:02.081 --> 33:03.313
or I'll throw you in there

33:03.315 --> 33:05.382
and let the Mormons
preach at you.

33:10.990 --> 33:13.056
You just holler
if you need anything.

33:18.397 --> 33:20.397
-Sheriff.
-Huh?

33:23.669 --> 33:25.602
Things getting tough
for you, Sam?

33:27.139 --> 33:28.672
I was handling it.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.374
They know that?

33:33.112 --> 33:36.013
Hear you got yourself
a couple of stowaways in there.

33:36.015 --> 33:39.416
Visitors.
Tried to help them escape.

33:39.418 --> 33:40.584
We stopped it, though.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.653
Well, good work, son.

33:43.655 --> 33:45.622
Tell you what. Why don't you
bring 'em out to me,

33:45.624 --> 33:49.426
and I'll, uh, be happy to
take 'em off your hands for you.

33:59.138 --> 34:00.570
Cowards.

34:00.572 --> 34:02.706
They never want to stay
and play.

34:02.708 --> 34:04.708
[laughs] Whoo!

34:04.710 --> 34:06.710
What's he doing with your gun?

34:06.712 --> 34:08.145
-Give me that.
-Hey.

34:08.147 --> 34:09.346
[Hyrum laughs]

34:09.348 --> 34:11.715
Slow down.
And oil that hammer.

34:11.717 --> 34:13.315
Hey, you need
to shut your mouth.

34:13.318 --> 34:15.217
Is that your grandma's rifle?

34:15.219 --> 34:16.520
I won't tell anyone.

34:16.522 --> 34:19.056
-Is it? Is it?
-That ain't funny.

34:19.058 --> 34:20.389
-Shut your mouth.
-That ain't funny!

34:20.391 --> 34:21.725
That ain't funny.

34:28.734 --> 34:33.070
[chewing]

34:33.072 --> 34:35.739

34:45.684 --> 34:47.184

[baby cooing]

35:57.289 --> 35:59.189
[chuckles]

36:03.862 --> 36:05.228
[Sam] Ma'am.

36:08.700 --> 36:10.534
We'd like to see our husbands.

36:10.536 --> 36:13.203
No one here except for me
and the prisoners.

36:13.205 --> 36:15.705
Joseph Smith. Hyrum Smith.

36:15.707 --> 36:17.941
We are told
they are being kept here.

36:17.943 --> 36:20.477
Visiting rights
have been suspended.

36:20.479 --> 36:21.912
On whose orders?

36:23.382 --> 36:24.748
Mine.

36:34.726 --> 36:38.228
A father should be able
to see his newborn son.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.698
[fussing]

36:41.700 --> 36:43.667
You shouldn't
have brought him here.

36:45.604 --> 36:47.604
This isn't a safe place to be.

36:47.606 --> 36:50.740
Safer in there
than standing out here.

36:50.742 --> 36:53.543
Most visitors want
to break them out or kill them.

36:53.545 --> 36:57.714
And of which do you suspect us?

37:00.686 --> 37:03.553
I thought Joseph was persuasive.

37:13.632 --> 37:17.300
[soft theme playing]

37:30.949 --> 37:32.816
[baby coos]

37:41.360 --> 37:42.859
Oh.

37:45.297 --> 37:48.031

38:34.579 --> 38:38.915
¶ ¶

39:25.097 --> 39:26.496
[Hyrum] What is it?

39:26.498 --> 39:29.599
-It's a date for the hearing.
-Hmm?

39:29.601 --> 39:31.634
Two weeks,
Clay County Courthouse,

39:31.636 --> 39:33.103
Judge Turnham.

39:33.105 --> 39:35.905
[Joseph]
What do we know of Turnham?

39:35.907 --> 39:37.907
[Doniphan] Not much.

39:37.909 --> 39:40.076
Judge King had grievances
with your people.

39:40.078 --> 39:42.946
Turnham doesn't,
that we know of.

39:42.948 --> 39:45.782
A judge should
withhold any personal bias

39:45.784 --> 39:48.852
in order to offer
a fair judgment based on law.

39:48.854 --> 39:50.887
Even those appointed to judge

39:50.889 --> 39:54.958
are subject to the persuasive
leanings of the masses.

39:56.395 --> 39:58.528
Not the way I see it.

39:58.530 --> 39:59.829
[Joseph]
Well, Mr. Tillery,

39:59.831 --> 40:02.532
were there a way
to have you hear our case,

40:02.534 --> 40:04.434
we'd gladly appoint you.

40:09.141 --> 40:10.807

[man 2]
That's real dark burnt meat.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.191
-[man 3] That's Mormon meat.
-[man 2] That's right.

40:28.193 --> 40:30.093

40:30.095 --> 40:34.063

40:34.065 --> 40:35.698

-Hyrum.

¶ Grab your guns ¶

[thump]

40:59.858 --> 41:00.807
[thump]

41:00.808 --> 41:01.757
[Sidney, mumbling]
You really want to know how

41:01.760 --> 41:04.127
we got here, start--

41:04.129 --> 41:06.796
start-- start back
from the beginning.

41:09.134 --> 41:10.467
So it was agreed

41:10.469 --> 41:12.635
to build fortifications

41:12.637 --> 41:13.937
throughout the night and--

41:13.939 --> 41:15.972
If we must fight, we would

41:17.809 --> 41:19.576
save our lives
as dearly we could.

41:21.012 --> 41:22.479
The cattle and pigs, they--

41:22.481 --> 41:24.547
they wandered in. They--

41:24.549 --> 41:27.684
They wandered in. The--

41:27.686 --> 41:29.519
Children of Israel.

41:29.521 --> 41:31.154
It's all we could do.

41:33.625 --> 41:38.595
Mr. Don-- I-- I won't allow
Mr. Doniphan to represent us.

41:40.232 --> 41:41.831
Did you hear me, Joseph?

41:42.868 --> 41:44.501
Uh-huh, okay.

41:44.503 --> 41:47.170
I'm not a lawyer,
but I can do a better job

41:47.172 --> 41:49.873
of getting us out of here
than-- than he can.

41:49.875 --> 41:51.808
That's a dumb fool idea.

41:51.810 --> 41:53.610
Likely to get us all convicted.

41:55.981 --> 41:59.682
The hearing, Caleb,
isn't to get a conviction.

41:59.684 --> 42:01.518
It's a court of inquiry

42:01.520 --> 42:04.721
to determine the need
for a jury at an actual trial.

42:04.723 --> 42:07.790
Still, our lawyer
should handle it.

42:07.792 --> 42:11.661
Not somebody
in your condition.

42:11.663 --> 42:13.663
[Sidney] My condition?

42:13.665 --> 42:15.231
[chuckles]

42:15.233 --> 42:16.599
You criticize me

42:16.601 --> 42:19.302
while we sit
in this cesspool for months?

42:19.304 --> 42:21.304
We're all sick.

42:21.306 --> 42:22.639
Half-starved.

42:22.641 --> 42:24.641
[coughs] Poisoned.

42:24.643 --> 42:27.176
And our lawyer is incapable
of coming to our defense.

42:27.178 --> 42:29.178
At the last hearing,
all that he proved

42:29.180 --> 42:30.947
is that he was ill-prepared

42:30.949 --> 42:32.715
and that he spoke
without a plan.

42:32.717 --> 42:34.784
[Alexander] You weren't
even there, Sidney.

42:34.786 --> 42:38.154
Turning jail into sick bay
while we endured a mock trial.

42:38.156 --> 42:41.224
There was not one fact
that was not misrepresented.

42:41.226 --> 42:44.093
And not one witness that did
not swear falsely against us.

42:44.095 --> 42:46.229
Because they'd have been killed
if they'd spoke.

42:46.231 --> 42:48.298
They had to protect
the witnesses.

42:48.300 --> 42:51.868
He should have protected us,
not the witnesses.

42:51.870 --> 42:53.636
He acted in fear.

42:53.638 --> 42:57.106
General Doniphan stood up for us
against an execution order.

42:57.108 --> 42:58.675
And look where that got us.

42:58.677 --> 43:00.143
The truth will protect us.

43:00.145 --> 43:02.011
Not if it's unable to be heard!

43:02.013 --> 43:04.714
And a mumbling fool
is going to make them hear it?

43:04.716 --> 43:08.184
No. I am not going
to let your childish tantrums

43:08.186 --> 43:11.988
ruin the one chance that I have
of seeing my wife and daughters.

43:11.990 --> 43:15.191
-You're not the only one
with a family, Alexander!
-That's enough!

43:24.636 --> 43:25.902
Sidney's right.

43:25.904 --> 43:30.273
It was a mock investigation.
A farce.

43:30.275 --> 43:33.142
Judge King's brother-in-law
got killed in Jackson County,

43:33.144 --> 43:34.677
and he held us accountable.

43:37.115 --> 43:39.148
Sidney's a skilled orator.

43:39.150 --> 43:42.185
He's at liberty of choosing
his own representation.

43:49.861 --> 43:51.294
Joseph.

43:51.296 --> 43:53.997
His pride
has clouded his judgment.

43:55.734 --> 43:58.334
They'll think he's a mumbling
wretch who lost his mind.

43:58.336 --> 44:01.371
Have no fear. Huh?

44:07.045 --> 44:08.778
If you go without fear,

44:09.914 --> 44:12.181
not a hair of your heads
will be harmed.

44:13.184 --> 44:16.386
And in time,
we will be released.

44:16.388 --> 44:18.421
Oh, stop it. You don't know.

44:18.423 --> 44:20.056
I do!

44:20.792 --> 44:22.158
And if you knew,

44:23.662 --> 44:25.795
this would be
an easier time for you.

44:27.999 --> 44:29.332
For all of us.

44:37.342 --> 44:40.109
[mumbling] It started--
It started in DeWitt.

44:43.114 --> 44:45.214
Ah... with...

44:47.719 --> 44:49.085
Four months ago.

44:51.456 --> 44:54.090
With winter coming.

44:54.092 --> 44:55.758
We-- We went down there.

44:55.760 --> 44:57.727
Because they had no houses.

44:57.729 --> 44:58.895
We had no sustenance.

44:58.897 --> 44:59.996
God is with us.

44:59.998 --> 45:01.998
[Sidney]
We were abandoned.

45:02.000 --> 45:03.199
He is our friend.

45:03.201 --> 45:05.868
[Sidney]
Everything was lost.

45:05.870 --> 45:08.071
He will save our souls.

45:08.073 --> 45:10.006
Our wives and children
are out there

45:10.008 --> 45:11.941
being harassed by the mobs.

45:11.943 --> 45:14.143
And those who fight against us

45:14.145 --> 45:16.479
will reap the fruits
of their labor.

45:16.481 --> 45:18.848
[Sidney] There is no justice
for the wicked.

45:18.850 --> 45:20.483
Walls and irons.

45:20.485 --> 45:22.118
Walls and irons.

45:22.120 --> 45:25.421
Doors and creaking hinges.

45:26.257 --> 45:28.725
Half scared to death guards

45:28.727 --> 45:31.027
stopping innocent men
from escaping

45:31.029 --> 45:34.063
are calculated
in their very nature

45:35.033 --> 45:37.800
to make the soul
of honest men stronger.

45:38.870 --> 45:40.303
Walls and irons.

45:42.140 --> 45:44.340
Stronger than
the powers of hell.

45:51.883 --> 45:54.517
[birds chirping]

45:54.519 --> 45:58.788
[soft theme playing]

45:58.790 --> 46:00.957

-Fine, I guess.

-[water sloshing]

46:10.301 --> 46:12.235
Little early for the liquor.

46:13.171 --> 46:15.171
Now, now, it's rude to stare.

46:22.547 --> 46:24.514
Are you still here?

46:28.153 --> 46:29.919
-Hey, Smith brothers.
-Hey.

46:29.921 --> 46:31.354
-Lyman.
-Porter.

46:31.356 --> 46:33.022
You and Cyrus made it out?

46:33.024 --> 46:36.425
They charged us with aiding
in you escaping jail.

46:37.829 --> 46:39.929
An act for which
you're clearly innocent.

46:39.931 --> 46:41.230
[laughs]

46:41.232 --> 46:43.299
Well, we'll try harder
next time.

46:44.335 --> 46:48.538
Uh, any news
from our families or--?

46:49.874 --> 46:52.074
No. Not from yours.

46:52.076 --> 46:53.943
Most everybody's gone
from here.

46:53.945 --> 46:55.011
Sidney in there?

46:55.013 --> 46:56.279
[Alexander] Yeah.

46:57.115 --> 46:58.915
Nerves have got him.

46:58.917 --> 47:01.217
Hey, Sidney!

47:01.219 --> 47:02.952
-How are you doing?
-Come on, come on.

47:02.954 --> 47:04.053
You hold on, okay?

47:04.055 --> 47:06.255
I saw your wife and daughters.

47:07.525 --> 47:09.892
How are they?
Are they-- Are they safe?

47:09.894 --> 47:10.993
They're fine.

47:10.995 --> 47:12.895
I told them you were fine, too.

47:13.965 --> 47:15.064
Then you lied to them.

47:15.066 --> 47:16.132
[chuckles]

47:16.134 --> 47:18.201
Hey, I brought you something.

47:23.208 --> 47:25.842
Here. Go on take it.

47:25.844 --> 47:29.846
[Joseph] Here, here. Careful.
You take it.

47:29.848 --> 47:31.848
I have not had clean water
for days.

47:31.850 --> 47:32.915
[Joseph laughs]

47:32.917 --> 47:34.383
Are you still looking to escape?

47:34.385 --> 47:36.619
It is our obligation to escape.

47:36.621 --> 47:39.188
The men here,
they don't care about justice.

47:40.258 --> 47:41.891
They only care
about our destruction.

47:41.893 --> 47:43.459
I know. So you told us.

47:44.863 --> 47:46.863
Here, I got
something else for you.

47:48.499 --> 47:50.299
I think you're gonna like it.

47:51.135 --> 47:52.501
Here, take it.

47:53.571 --> 47:55.404
[Alexander]
What in the world?

47:55.406 --> 47:57.506
[Porter] I got another one
for you. Here.

47:59.010 --> 48:00.343
Here.

48:01.479 --> 48:02.912
Got it.

48:05.216 --> 48:06.415
-How did you--
-Don't ask.

48:06.417 --> 48:08.251
Got a lot of funny looks,
though.

48:09.220 --> 48:11.220
More than usual?

48:11.222 --> 48:13.289
Now, what you're gonna do,

48:13.291 --> 48:14.957
these walls are four feet thick.

48:14.959 --> 48:17.426
So if you cut through three,
four inches a day,

48:17.428 --> 48:19.662
you can get-- get out
in less than two weeks.

48:19.664 --> 48:22.398
But you gotta-- you gotta use
'em both together

48:22.400 --> 48:23.399
so you can make a hole.

48:23.401 --> 48:25.468
Porter, we-- we got it.

48:27.939 --> 48:30.506
Right. Okay, sorry.

48:31.476 --> 48:32.642
Here.

48:34.212 --> 48:36.279
Here, just another sip.

48:36.281 --> 48:39.048
I got it. Here it comes.
Here it comes.

48:39.050 --> 48:40.316
Okay, okay, okay.

48:40.318 --> 48:41.417
Careful, careful.

48:41.419 --> 48:43.419
[Porter]
You take care now.

48:43.421 --> 48:45.655
And remember,
you gotta use your shoulders.

48:45.657 --> 48:48.491
Your arms will get dead tired
if you just use your arms.

48:50.295 --> 48:52.395
Thank you, fellow wanderer.

48:52.397 --> 48:53.963
For everything.

49:02.340 --> 49:04.373
You just get yourself out,
Joseph.

49:06.244 --> 49:07.576
We miss you.

49:10.715 --> 49:12.348
Godspeed, friend.

49:14.085 --> 49:15.418
Yeah, okay.

49:17.121 --> 49:19.488
Well, I gotta go.

49:19.490 --> 49:21.724
I'm jumping bail. [laughing]

49:23.161 --> 49:24.560
Don't tell anyone I was here.

49:25.263 --> 49:27.697
[laughing]

49:33.237 --> 49:34.704
Here.

49:37.675 --> 49:40.242
Right here.

49:40.244 --> 49:42.745
Through these walls?
With those?

49:47.118 --> 49:48.651
He is an innocent and noble man.

49:48.653 --> 49:51.420
And was an innocent
and noble child.

49:55.393 --> 49:57.259
-[thud]
-[grunting]

49:57.261 --> 49:58.594
[Sidney] It won't work.

49:59.697 --> 50:00.997
It'll never work.

50:00.999 --> 50:02.531
It'll never work.

50:02.533 --> 50:04.033
No, my soul loves him.

50:04.035 --> 50:06.369
[Hyrum, grunts]
I think it could work.

50:15.246 --> 50:18.047
[straining]

50:18.049 --> 50:19.215
Got it.

50:19.217 --> 50:21.550
It's an exercise in futility.

50:21.552 --> 50:22.551
Adding insult to injury.

50:22.553 --> 50:25.154
I-- I won't watch.

50:26.591 --> 50:28.024
[grunts]

50:28.026 --> 50:30.092
You know what
is an exercise in futility?

50:31.129 --> 50:32.661
Turning water into wine.

50:36.034 --> 50:37.800
[Lyman] And telling
a lame man to walk.

50:39.437 --> 50:41.137
Or healing even one blind beggar

50:41.139 --> 50:43.305
when there's hundreds
of others suffering.

50:43.307 --> 50:45.041
Or raising the dead
for that matter.

50:45.043 --> 50:47.576
I'm familiar with the miracles
in the New Testament.

50:49.514 --> 50:52.114
At this moment,
they bring me no hope.

50:52.116 --> 50:55.584
Perhaps you prefer the miracles
of the Old Testament.

50:55.586 --> 50:57.086
Or the Book of Mormon.

50:57.088 --> 50:58.387
Jesus still suffered,

50:58.389 --> 51:00.289
despite the miracles
that he performed.

51:00.291 --> 51:03.059
We'll be dead by the time
those things dig us out of here.

51:03.061 --> 51:04.660
Then don't watch.

51:04.662 --> 51:06.595
[grunts] Here bring
the other one over here.

51:06.597 --> 51:08.297
Let's go, at the same time.

51:08.299 --> 51:09.365
Joseph, here.

51:09.367 --> 51:11.133
Let's get them both going.

51:12.070 --> 51:13.669
Oh! Two of them!

51:17.642 --> 51:19.675
[Sidney]
Walls that are four feet thick.

51:20.478 --> 51:22.211
Why have you forsaken us?!

51:23.481 --> 51:24.814
There's no escape.

51:26.217 --> 51:28.751
-We will never survive this!
-Get a hold of yourself!

51:28.753 --> 51:31.220
-You're hopeless.
-We're hopeless!

51:31.222 --> 51:33.222
Not even Jesus has suffered
as much as I have!

51:33.224 --> 51:36.659
[dramatic theme playing]

51:39.797 --> 51:42.465
[crying]

52:08.392 --> 52:10.860
[tools clacking]

52:17.635 --> 52:20.703
[voice whispering]

52:29.847 --> 52:33.149
[Sidney, mumbling]
We-- We all went to DeWitt.

52:33.151 --> 52:36.652
[muttering]

52:36.654 --> 52:38.587
We all went on to DeWitt.

52:38.589 --> 52:40.489
-[Lyman] Sidney.
-They--

52:40.491 --> 52:43.592
They told us that we couldn't.
That we shouldn't.

52:43.594 --> 52:46.428
-Sidney.
-They retaliated.

52:46.430 --> 52:48.597
They-- They attacked us.

52:48.599 --> 52:50.166
They attacked us.

52:50.168 --> 52:52.701
They attacked us
for trying to help our people.

52:56.174 --> 52:57.506
Joseph.

52:58.776 --> 53:00.309
Joseph, I don't know
what to do.

53:00.311 --> 53:02.211
Shh shh shh shh.

53:03.581 --> 53:08.250
Sidney is a...
is a very great and good man.

53:10.454 --> 53:12.922
He is, though, selfish.

53:14.425 --> 53:16.926
I'm sure it destroys
your confidence in him.

53:20.965 --> 53:24.667
We can suffer him, though,
for a while longer.

53:25.803 --> 53:27.937
He is a man
whom God will uphold

53:29.373 --> 53:31.273
if he will continue faithful.

54:05.476 --> 54:07.977
[men straining]

54:16.287 --> 54:17.786
[blowing]

54:29.267 --> 54:31.667
[groaning]

54:46.651 --> 54:48.384
-Here, let me have a go.
-[grunts]

54:49.654 --> 54:51.620
[Neil, sing-song]
Joseph!

54:52.990 --> 54:54.356
Joseph!

54:55.893 --> 54:56.692
It's me.

54:56.694 --> 54:59.028
Your guardian angel.

55:00.831 --> 55:02.531
-Stop it!
-What are y'all
doing in there?

55:02.533 --> 55:03.899
Stop it! Stop it!

55:05.569 --> 55:08.570
-Hurry. Hurry.
-Hurry!

55:08.572 --> 55:10.339
-[laughing]
-Good morning!

55:10.341 --> 55:14.677
[Neil] I bring warm regards
from your wives and your people.

55:15.946 --> 55:17.980
God and Liberty.

55:19.050 --> 55:20.416
Sound familiar?

55:21.485 --> 55:23.319
It's what your people shouted

55:23.321 --> 55:25.821
when you attacked us
at Crooked River.

55:27.725 --> 55:30.859
We were ordered
to protect Ray County,

55:30.861 --> 55:32.928
and you come fire
on our camp.

55:37.335 --> 55:39.935
You killed my brother, and you
got nothing to say about it?

55:41.038 --> 55:43.405
A man was shot
after a group of vigilantes

55:43.407 --> 55:44.840
raided the homes of our people.

55:44.842 --> 55:48.911
No. He was a member
of the state militia,

55:48.913 --> 55:50.879
and he was murdered
by a mob of Mormons!

55:50.881 --> 55:54.450
He was a wolf, who hid
his hair, teeth, and tail

55:54.452 --> 55:56.885
in a militia's sheepskin
made of wool!

55:56.887 --> 55:58.954
That's who your brother was!

55:58.956 --> 56:00.556
Come here!

56:00.558 --> 56:02.725
[struggling]

56:02.727 --> 56:04.026
Hold his arm! Hold it!

56:05.796 --> 56:07.996
-Kill him!
-[Neil groans]

56:07.998 --> 56:10.766
-You attack unarmed men!
-Come on!

56:10.768 --> 56:13.969
You think you're the only one
to ever fight in a battle?

56:13.971 --> 56:15.871
[groans]

56:15.873 --> 56:17.940
-Hold his arm!
-Get it!

56:19.543 --> 56:20.776
[Caleb]
How does it feel now?!

56:20.778 --> 56:22.511
[groaning]

56:25.082 --> 56:27.583
I'll kill every one of you!

56:27.585 --> 56:29.118
You think
you're safe in there?!

56:29.120 --> 56:32.521
Show your face!
I'll kill you right now!

56:32.523 --> 56:34.757
-Aah!
-Shoot them!

56:37.495 --> 56:39.728
[Neil grunting]

56:39.730 --> 56:41.063
This is my jail!

56:41.065 --> 56:42.798
Oh!

56:53.711 --> 56:55.110
That-a-boy, Neil!

57:00.885 --> 57:02.151
Hold him! Hold him!

57:02.153 --> 57:04.753
[Neil] This has
gone on long enough!

57:04.755 --> 57:07.790
Neil! The hearing
is in a week!

57:07.792 --> 57:09.558
Then they're out of my watch!

57:10.828 --> 57:12.494
You hear that?!

57:12.496 --> 57:14.430
Only one more week in there!

57:14.432 --> 57:15.831
No more walls to hide you!

57:15.833 --> 57:18.534
-[Sam groans]
-We're going to court!

57:20.971 --> 57:22.938
[Sam]
Let the law handle this.

57:24.442 --> 57:25.908
[groans]

57:27.578 --> 57:29.044
Go inside, Sam.

57:30.748 --> 57:32.548
Getting too rough
for you out here.

57:32.550 --> 57:34.049
[Parker laughing]

57:36.187 --> 57:37.519
Ahh...

[men straining]

58:00.077 --> 58:03.045
[grunting]

58:03.047 --> 58:04.880
What's the point anymore?

58:04.882 --> 58:07.483
We're gonna be out of here
before you can dig that hole.

58:07.485 --> 58:10.152
We won't need a hearing
if I can just get to--

58:10.154 --> 58:11.987
[grunting]

58:12.957 --> 58:14.723
-Hey, need me to spot you?
-No!

58:14.725 --> 58:16.191
I think you're stuck.

58:17.595 --> 58:18.927
It's no use.

58:18.929 --> 58:20.762
[straining]

58:20.764 --> 58:22.564

58:22.566 --> 58:23.665
Wait, Caleb.

58:23.667 --> 58:24.700
-[handle snaps]
-Aah!

58:24.702 --> 58:25.801
-Caleb!
-Aah!

58:25.803 --> 58:28.170
[Caleb groaning]

58:31.909 --> 58:33.775
[Hyrum] Useless.

58:33.777 --> 58:34.776
Sorry.

58:34.778 --> 58:36.278
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

58:36.280 --> 58:37.646
You hit something.

58:38.616 --> 58:39.948
[Caleb] What?

58:40.651 --> 58:43.552
[straining]

58:45.122 --> 58:46.622
Unh!

58:56.634 --> 58:58.000
Rock.

59:00.938 --> 59:03.605
[clacking]

59:07.912 --> 59:09.611
This could go quickly.

59:09.613 --> 59:11.013
-Ha ha!
-This is it!

59:16.186 --> 59:17.553
[straining]

59:17.555 --> 59:19.288
[rock clattering]

59:20.858 --> 59:23.926
Here. Here. Here's another one.

59:38.709 --> 59:40.242
[rock clatters]

59:45.049 --> 59:46.715
We'll keep trying.

59:46.717 --> 59:48.183
Thank you.

59:54.925 --> 59:58.193
You think Sidney's going
to argue his way out tomorrow?

01:00:04.835 --> 01:00:06.602
[kindling snaps]

01:00:08.739 --> 01:00:11.940
Sidney was the first man
that taught me my religion.

01:00:13.711 --> 01:00:15.978
Or taught me to care about it.

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:18.747
Me and Caleb both.

01:00:22.753 --> 01:00:24.620
I forget that sometimes.

01:00:27.725 --> 01:00:29.091
[Alexander] Yeah.

01:00:30.995 --> 01:00:34.029
I went to a revival
that he was preaching at.

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:37.099
Harriet and I went

01:00:37.101 --> 01:00:39.635
out of curiosity.

01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:47.009
And Sidney preaches
this magnificent sermon,

01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:48.377
like he always does.

01:00:49.847 --> 01:00:51.213
It was intelligent,

01:00:52.383 --> 01:00:53.915
logical,

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:55.250
direct.

01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:59.221
And at the end of it,

01:00:59.223 --> 01:01:01.023
he asked people
to come up and be baptized,

01:01:01.025 --> 01:01:03.725
and I just felt something
pull me up there.

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:13.686
He spoke in a way

01:01:13.687 --> 01:01:16.038
that brought a Holy Spirit
to stir hearts

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.006
that could change
their very beliefs.

01:01:19.276 --> 01:01:21.009
So when he joined
Joseph in the church,

01:01:21.011 --> 01:01:24.212
it was impossible
not to want to join as well.

01:01:27.818 --> 01:01:30.719
I don't think that's
the same Sidney anymore.

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:46.334

01:01:58.982 --> 01:02:00.182

01:02:00.184 --> 01:02:03.185
Listen up! This ends today!

01:02:03.187 --> 01:02:05.487
No one gets in that courthouse,
understood?

01:02:09.993 --> 01:02:11.793
There will be no court today.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:23.438
[straining]

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:24.973
Get him. Get him.

01:02:26.176 --> 01:02:29.077
You really ought
to reconsider this, huh?

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:30.912
Let me govern myself, Joseph.

01:02:30.914 --> 01:02:32.748
Yeah, yeah, come on.

01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:34.282
You think you guys
are getting out today?

01:02:34.284 --> 01:02:36.284
One way or another.

01:02:36.286 --> 01:02:37.753
But I need a favor.

01:02:37.755 --> 01:02:39.187
What?

01:02:42.059 --> 01:02:43.892
-What's that?
-Shh.

01:02:43.894 --> 01:02:46.194
Take it. Fix it. Bring it back.

01:02:51.301 --> 01:02:53.435
Hope we're not being judged
on appearances.

01:02:55.172 --> 01:02:57.139
-Where are you going?
-I'm a visitor.

01:02:57.141 --> 01:02:59.107
Don't shoot at me.

01:03:01.912 --> 01:03:03.245
Gentlemen.

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:05.781
We'll need to move quickly

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:07.449
before more men gather
at the courthouse.

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:09.417
The state's
gonna protect my men?

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:11.119
The state doesn't have
the resources

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:13.255
to escort you
to the courthouse.

01:03:13.257 --> 01:03:15.357
A couple of deputies on horses?

01:03:15.359 --> 01:03:17.926
What are we supposed to do?

01:03:17.928 --> 01:03:19.427
-We go!
-No, we wait.

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:22.230
We cannot let a gathering mob
impede our justice.

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:25.801
We should go once we are
assured they have disbanded.

01:03:25.803 --> 01:03:27.803
[Doniphan] We'll need
to postpone the hearing.

01:03:27.805 --> 01:03:31.206
We'll file for another petition,
and then we'll-- Joseph.

01:03:36.413 --> 01:03:38.413
I will no longer abide this.

01:03:39.950 --> 01:03:40.949
[Doniphan] Wait!

01:03:40.951 --> 01:03:42.317
Joseph!

01:03:43.353 --> 01:03:45.487
This is not the way
to handle this.

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:47.355
Now, James, wait.

01:03:49.092 --> 01:03:50.458
Keep them here.

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:54.296
I will take you to Turnham.

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:04.306
Renegades, liars, and murderers
have poured down a flood

01:04:04.308 --> 01:04:05.974
of filthiness and vomit
upon our heads,

01:04:05.976 --> 01:04:11.213
and most men see and acknowledge
that it is incorrect.

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:15.317
Let Doniphan present that today.

01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:29.364
Let the system function
as it is intended.

01:04:36.073 --> 01:04:39.207
[dramatic theme playing]

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:44.613
Turnham's moved the hearing,
but we gotta go now.

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:46.882
[whinnies]

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:06.167
[assistant]
All right, we will get started

01:05:06.169 --> 01:05:09.571
with the court of inquiry
with Judge Turnham presiding.

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:12.908
It has been noted that we have
relocated to the schoolhouse

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:14.242
by request of the court.

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:17.045
This should be
in a proper courthouse.

01:05:19.149 --> 01:05:22.050
Would your client prefer this
in a more hostile setting?

01:05:22.052 --> 01:05:24.019
[Doniphan] No, Your Honor,
this is a fine setting.

01:05:24.021 --> 01:05:26.955
-He doesn't speak for me.
-Sidney, enough.

01:05:29.192 --> 01:05:30.959
Move on.

01:05:30.961 --> 01:05:33.161
In Daviess County,
under the jurisdiction

01:05:33.163 --> 01:05:36.331
of Judge Austin A. King,

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:38.934
charges of treason were upheld

01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:41.102
and supported by the laws
of the county.

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:44.306
The state has granted
this court of inquiry

01:05:44.308 --> 01:05:46.007
by request of the defense.

01:05:47.477 --> 01:05:49.344
[Turnham]
Mr. Doniphan.

01:05:49.346 --> 01:05:50.445
Are you ready to proceed?

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.013
Absolutely. Gentlemen.

01:05:52.015 --> 01:05:53.515
[gavel pounds]

01:06:02.993 --> 01:06:04.359
Where they at, Neil?

01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:05.694
They ain't coming!

01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:08.263
There's a group of folks

01:06:08.265 --> 01:06:09.631
gathered down
by the schoolhouse.

01:06:09.633 --> 01:06:11.967
[man]
We best be on our way.

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:15.403
[Neil] Sam Tillery.
Always running from a fight!

01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:18.573
[Doniphan] Your Honor,
in response to the charges

01:06:18.575 --> 01:06:20.241
of treason against my clients,

01:06:20.243 --> 01:06:23.244
charged only for the reason
that it is unbailable,

01:06:23.246 --> 01:06:26.982
we request the court consider
the legality of such claims.

01:06:26.984 --> 01:06:28.383
[door opens]

01:06:28.385 --> 01:06:30.218
[man] Halt! Stop!

01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.619
Keep out of here!

01:06:33.256 --> 01:06:34.389
You start without me, Sam?

01:06:34.391 --> 01:06:36.324
Gentlemen, please!

01:06:39.563 --> 01:06:41.429
[Neil]
Apologies, Your Honor.

01:06:52.476 --> 01:06:54.776
[Doniphan]
Your Honor, as I was saying,

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:59.381
with regards to the
constitutionality of treason,

01:06:59.383 --> 01:07:01.182
dating back to 18--

01:07:01.184 --> 01:07:02.550
[Neil] Speak up!

01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:04.085
Let us hear why these men
shouldn't be held

01:07:04.087 --> 01:07:07.355
to the same laws
as the people of Missouri.

01:07:09.459 --> 01:07:11.092
Your Honor, may I approach?

01:07:13.296 --> 01:07:17.298
Your Honor, my clients cannot
have a fair hearing
in this setting.

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:18.733
For the safety
of everyone involved,

01:07:18.735 --> 01:07:21.569
I request we reschedule
before someone gets shot.

01:07:26.109 --> 01:07:27.742
[clears throat]

01:07:27.744 --> 01:07:32.447
It seems it's in
the best interest of the court

01:07:32.449 --> 01:07:35.583
to return the defendants
to the protection

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:36.751
of the jail at Liberty.

01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:37.719
Protection?

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:40.588
[crowd murmuring]

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:43.625
[Neil] That's right!
Back to Liberty!

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:46.494
Let's go, boys, this is over.

01:07:46.496 --> 01:07:48.696
-[tapping]
-No hearing today. No!

01:07:48.698 --> 01:07:50.298
-[Neil laughs]
-[Sidney] No!

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:51.599
[cane tapping]

01:07:51.601 --> 01:07:52.734
No!

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:54.302
[shouting] No!

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:55.703
No!

01:07:57.107 --> 01:07:59.607
I will not allow it!

01:08:00.510 --> 01:08:02.077
I have suffered to come today

01:08:02.079 --> 01:08:03.645
to make my case
before an honorable court,

01:08:03.647 --> 01:08:06.614
and so help me,
with or without God,

01:08:06.616 --> 01:08:09.417
I will not allow
the intimidation of any man

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:11.753
to interfere
with my right to be heard.

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:13.154
Stand up if you want to speak.

01:08:13.156 --> 01:08:15.156
Quiet. Let him speak.

01:08:20.330 --> 01:08:22.529
[sighs]

01:08:22.532 --> 01:08:25.700
All that has been required

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:28.502
to persecute a man or a woman

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:30.371
in the State of Missouri
as of late

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:34.109
is a suspicion that they are in
what the mob calls

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:35.609
the Mormon religion.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.881
As leadership of the Restored
Church of Jesus Christ,

01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:42.250
we chose to evacuate
one of the settlements

01:08:42.252 --> 01:08:44.786
which was experiencing
extreme persecution.

01:08:44.787 --> 01:08:47.255
However, thus protecting
our people,

01:08:47.256 --> 01:08:49.457
only gave the mob more courage

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.460
to increase
its violence against us.

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:54.496
Can't you stand up, Mormon?

01:08:57.434 --> 01:09:01.236
[somber theme playing]

01:09:21.558 --> 01:09:22.924
The State of Missouri,

01:09:22.926 --> 01:09:25.225
seeing the increased persecution
to our people,

01:09:26.429 --> 01:09:29.564
brought in a militia
to protect us.

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:32.267
But instead,
they abandoned their posts,

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:34.602
leaving us helpless.

01:09:35.939 --> 01:09:38.573
Some of them even joined
the mobs against us.

01:09:38.575 --> 01:09:41.341
Their job was to protect,

01:09:41.344 --> 01:09:42.743
yet they fled.

01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:47.881
After the state
had recalled its forces,

01:09:47.884 --> 01:09:51.252
the mob began setting
the prairies on fire,

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:54.255
burning our homes

01:09:54.256 --> 01:09:56.257
and destroying our farms.

01:10:00.263 --> 01:10:03.698
Our people were forced
to live in tents and wagons.

01:10:04.901 --> 01:10:07.402
One moment,
we heard of a planned attack,

01:10:07.404 --> 01:10:09.671
so we built fortifications
throughout the night

01:10:09.673 --> 01:10:12.540
to protect our lives
as dearly as we could.

01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:16.244
When the morning came,

01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:20.582
there was no attack.

01:10:20.584 --> 01:10:24.652
Instead, there was a demand
set on our lives.

01:10:25.655 --> 01:10:27.655
We were taken captive.

01:10:27.657 --> 01:10:30.491
An order from our governor.

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:32.260
For the protection
of our people.

01:10:33.496 --> 01:10:35.763
When our abandoned livestock
wandered into our camp,

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:38.299
it was thankfully used
as sustenance.

01:10:39.836 --> 01:10:41.936
From that went out the cry

01:10:43.006 --> 01:10:44.906
that the people of DeWitt

01:10:44.908 --> 01:10:46.908
were thieves and plunderers,

01:10:47.677 --> 01:10:50.311
stealing cattle and hogs.

01:10:54.284 --> 01:10:58.353
[voice breaking]
It was all that they could do

01:10:58.355 --> 01:10:59.621
to survive.

01:10:59.623 --> 01:11:01.856
[crowd whispering]

01:11:06.997 --> 01:11:11.032
Our people are being torn
from their homes

01:11:11.034 --> 01:11:14.602
and being subject
to every ungodly deed of man,

01:11:15.405 --> 01:11:16.738
and it continues

01:11:16.740 --> 01:11:19.641
as even we,
their appointed leaders,

01:11:20.677 --> 01:11:23.378
are being held captive
in Liberty.

01:11:25.048 --> 01:11:27.815
You attempt to prove us
guilty of treason

01:11:27.817 --> 01:11:30.051
in consequence of a night
of building fortifications

01:11:30.053 --> 01:11:32.620
for a people
in desperate need.

01:11:32.622 --> 01:11:34.856
You attempt to prove us
guilty of murder

01:11:34.858 --> 01:11:37.925
for an act of defense
in which we were not even there.

01:11:37.927 --> 01:11:41.429
Your charges
of theft, larceny, burglary,

01:11:41.431 --> 01:11:44.465
arson, and stealing
are all based on accusations

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:47.302
for which I was
not even there at the time.

01:11:47.304 --> 01:11:48.670
I am innocent!

01:11:48.672 --> 01:11:50.438
And my fellow church leaders
are innocent!

01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.774
And the State of Missouri
has forsaken justice

01:11:52.776 --> 01:11:55.009
if we are
not to be released this day!

01:11:55.011 --> 01:11:57.545
[woman]
If this man does not go free,

01:11:57.547 --> 01:11:59.714
that disgrace is on all of you!

01:11:59.716 --> 01:12:01.783
[Neil]
If this man goes free,

01:12:01.785 --> 01:12:04.319
they'll all be dead
by nightfall.

01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:05.687
[gavel pounds]

01:12:05.689 --> 01:12:07.088
I will not have
your threats in this court!

01:12:07.090 --> 01:12:09.023
Hey, Your Honor,
we have money for bail.

01:12:09.025 --> 01:12:11.926
[man 1] There's
no bail for treason!

01:12:11.928 --> 01:12:13.795
-He's buying you out, Judge!
-[man 2] It's hush money!

01:12:13.797 --> 01:12:15.763
[man 3] What about
the extermination order?!

01:12:15.765 --> 01:12:16.831
Clear this man's charges!

01:12:16.833 --> 01:12:18.800
Give him immediate release!

01:12:21.738 --> 01:12:23.037
Never have I had the fortune

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:25.039
of hearing a discourse
such as this.

01:12:26.643 --> 01:12:28.943
[whispering]
You did it. You did it.

01:12:30.547 --> 01:12:32.814
The rest of the men
are to be taken back to jail

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:34.415
to await their trials.

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:37.618
This is not the law.

01:12:37.620 --> 01:12:39.921
You forget yourself, jailer.

01:12:41.758 --> 01:12:43.091
It's enough, Neil.

01:12:43.093 --> 01:12:44.459
Let them free.

01:12:44.461 --> 01:12:45.960
-Your Honor--
-Hey! Hey!

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:49.397
A Missouri liar!

01:12:49.399 --> 01:12:51.065
Order! Order!

01:12:51.067 --> 01:12:52.533
[crowd shouting]

01:12:52.535 --> 01:12:53.901
Another time!

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:56.371
You're free.
You got what you wanted.

01:12:56.373 --> 01:12:58.139
This is not
how I wanted it to be.

01:12:58.141 --> 01:13:01.542
No. No. Please, please,
take me back!

01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:04.011
Please! Please, Joseph! Please!

01:13:04.013 --> 01:13:06.013
-He wants to go back.
-Then take him!

01:13:06.015 --> 01:13:08.549
It's not my job
to hold an innocent man.

01:13:08.551 --> 01:13:09.784
I've done all I can.

01:13:09.786 --> 01:13:13.454
[dramatic theme playing]

01:13:20.697 --> 01:13:22.063
Drink.

01:13:34.677 --> 01:13:36.077
[Sam]
How do you do it?

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:41.048
I've never seen anything
like that before.

01:13:42.419 --> 01:13:44.786
It turned like that.
It was something

01:13:46.756 --> 01:13:48.489
quite unexpected.

01:13:50.727 --> 01:13:53.761
It's just a matter of taking
matters into one's own hands.

01:13:55.432 --> 01:13:58.132
Not relying on someone else
to fix the injustice.

01:13:59.202 --> 01:14:01.869
I meant turning your back
on your friends.

01:14:11.648 --> 01:14:14.482
Do you have a-- a wife, jailer?

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:17.952
Are you married?

01:14:18.822 --> 01:14:20.188
Do you have a family?

01:14:26.796 --> 01:14:29.864
While I sat in chains
in Richmond,

01:14:31.901 --> 01:14:34.469
and was subject to listen
to every vile act

01:14:34.471 --> 01:14:39.907
that was committed against women
by those despicable reprobates,

01:14:41.544 --> 01:14:45.046
one thing became very clear.

01:14:45.882 --> 01:14:47.215
That if I had a choice

01:14:48.485 --> 01:14:50.585
to sit in jail
and wait for the state

01:14:50.587 --> 01:14:51.819
to figure our innocence,

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:53.554
or if I could find any way out

01:14:53.556 --> 01:14:55.156
so that I could be with my wife

01:14:55.158 --> 01:14:56.924
and my daughters,

01:14:59.963 --> 01:15:03.030
you can bet,
as sure as the day is long,

01:15:03.032 --> 01:15:06.501
I'm gonna move heaven and hell
to get out of here.

01:15:08.738 --> 01:15:12.640
There's not a man in that cell
that wouldn't do the same.

01:15:15.144 --> 01:15:19.947
Sitting in a jail
day after day

01:15:19.949 --> 01:15:23.584
isn't a position
that any man should aspire to.

01:15:28.758 --> 01:15:31.192
Listen to me,
you insufferable drivel!

01:15:32.195 --> 01:15:34.929
You think I want to be here?!

01:15:34.931 --> 01:15:37.198
Watching over the likes of you?!

01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:38.599
Sam.

01:15:44.807 --> 01:15:45.840
[Sidney gasps]

01:15:45.842 --> 01:15:47.608
I fought in Bladensburg.

01:15:49.145 --> 01:15:51.679
Under command of General Winder.

01:15:51.681 --> 01:15:54.081
We were outnumbered.

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:57.018
The enemy marching on us,
and we had nowhere to turn.

01:15:57.954 --> 01:16:00.688
He commanded us to retreat.

01:16:00.690 --> 01:16:02.323
We ran for our lives

01:16:02.325 --> 01:16:04.926
while the British set fire
to Washington.

01:16:06.796 --> 01:16:10.264
Ever since that moment, I have
been accused of being a traitor

01:16:13.102 --> 01:16:15.603
and being the cause
of the loss of our capitol

01:16:17.106 --> 01:16:20.274
and of the lives of the men
who fought beside me.

01:16:22.345 --> 01:16:25.580
You can leave
your men here tonight,

01:16:25.582 --> 01:16:29.684
but this will haunt you
the rest of your life.

01:16:31.588 --> 01:16:34.655
You church people think
you're the only ones
that know suffering.

01:16:36.025 --> 01:16:38.059
Who have seen an injustice.

01:16:38.995 --> 01:16:40.595
You go back to your wife,

01:16:40.597 --> 01:16:42.096
to your daughters.

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:43.931
You take them out of Missouri.

01:16:46.069 --> 01:16:49.070
You find yourself a nice piece
of land to settle.

01:16:51.341 --> 01:16:54.775
The sooner you stop preaching
yourself above others,

01:16:54.777 --> 01:16:57.945
the sooner we'll be closer
to living side by side in peace.

01:17:00.650 --> 01:17:02.283
[knock on door]

01:17:03.152 --> 01:17:04.685
[Sam] Who's there?

01:17:04.687 --> 01:17:06.754
[Phoebe Rigdon]
I'm here for my husband!

01:17:18.935 --> 01:17:20.334
Sidney.

01:17:21.704 --> 01:17:22.737
Phoebe.

01:17:22.739 --> 01:17:25.039
[crying]

01:17:26.075 --> 01:17:27.708
[Sidney]
I missed you.

01:17:29.646 --> 01:17:31.712
Look at what
they've done to you.

01:17:31.714 --> 01:17:33.047
You came alone?

01:17:33.916 --> 01:17:35.349
Cyrus drove right through.

01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:37.985
He's with the wagon
about three miles down.

01:17:41.658 --> 01:17:43.324
Your friend is leaving!

01:17:46.729 --> 01:17:48.262
Joseph.

01:17:56.939 --> 01:17:58.439
Thank you for coming.

01:18:23.199 --> 01:18:24.832
Phoebe and I are off.

01:18:31.941 --> 01:18:34.709
Tell our families
not to lose hope.

01:18:34.711 --> 01:18:37.211
I'll do everything that I can
to look after the church.

01:18:42.485 --> 01:18:44.085
Be well, Sidney.

01:19:31.968 --> 01:19:34.201
Do you suppose there's somebody
waiting out there to attack?

01:19:34.203 --> 01:19:36.103
It's none of my concern.

01:19:39.242 --> 01:19:41.408
Suppose that we were
to wait in--

01:19:50.486 --> 01:19:52.086
[Alexander sighs]

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:54.188
It just doesn't sit right
with me.

01:19:56.025 --> 01:19:58.826
He complains himself into jail.

01:19:59.862 --> 01:20:02.263
Complains the whole time
he's here.

01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:06.834
And then complains
himself right out.

01:20:07.804 --> 01:20:09.403
We just gotta suffer it.

01:20:11.874 --> 01:20:13.207
Right, Joseph?

01:20:18.214 --> 01:20:19.580
I suppose.

01:21:05.962 --> 01:21:08.996
[straining]

01:21:08.998 --> 01:21:11.398
[chipping stone]

01:21:18.274 --> 01:21:19.406
[Sam] We're coming down.

01:21:19.408 --> 01:21:22.643
Everybody against the wall! Now!

01:21:50.306 --> 01:21:52.907
[sighs] Son of a--

01:21:58.381 --> 01:22:00.981
You allow them
to do this to my jail.

01:22:03.953 --> 01:22:05.319
Here.

01:22:14.997 --> 01:22:16.463
How'd he get found out?

01:22:16.465 --> 01:22:19.333
He was bragging
about needing a replacement.

01:22:19.335 --> 01:22:21.568
Fool never could keep
his mouth shut.

01:22:24.941 --> 01:22:26.440
Take care of this.

01:22:38.487 --> 01:22:40.688
We got a wall to fix!

01:22:40.690 --> 01:22:42.389
And bring the irons!

01:22:44.093 --> 01:22:45.659
That's not necessary.

01:22:45.661 --> 01:22:47.494
Neither was this.

01:22:48.397 --> 01:22:49.997
[irons thudding]

01:22:54.136 --> 01:22:55.970
You carry on for months

01:22:57.406 --> 01:23:00.174
about how the law
is gonna set you free,

01:23:00.176 --> 01:23:03.310
the whole time trying
to scratch your way out of here?

01:23:03.312 --> 01:23:05.312
We are a target in here.

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:07.047
And you of all people know that.

01:23:08.017 --> 01:23:09.683
You escape, I'm liable.

01:23:09.685 --> 01:23:12.086
So we're protecting you now.

01:23:17.159 --> 01:23:18.659
-Leg.
-No!

01:23:21.130 --> 01:23:23.664
You're gonna have to kill me
to put those chains on me.

01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:27.735
Don't make this worse.

01:23:29.071 --> 01:23:31.071
-[shouting]
-Ohh!

01:23:31.073 --> 01:23:32.406
Hey! Hey! Get back!

01:23:32.408 --> 01:23:35.542
[shouting]

01:23:38.214 --> 01:23:40.147
Ooh!

01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:43.017
[sound muffled]

01:23:43.019 --> 01:23:46.153
[shouting continuing]

01:23:54.663 --> 01:23:57.164
-[sound grows clearer]
-Stop!

01:23:58.067 --> 01:23:59.433
Stop!

01:24:05.574 --> 01:24:08.642
[men panting and coughing]

01:24:14.383 --> 01:24:15.716
Lock 'em up.

01:24:34.370 --> 01:24:36.203
Won't be but a minute.

01:24:39.241 --> 01:24:40.474
Sidney gone?

01:24:40.476 --> 01:24:41.842
[Sam] Yep.

01:24:43.079 --> 01:24:44.411
The others?

01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:46.113
Locked up.

01:24:47.450 --> 01:24:48.816
You've done right, Sam.

01:24:50.853 --> 01:24:53.487
Clay County is lucky
to have a man like you.

01:24:53.489 --> 01:24:55.089
You handle this right,
we're gonna have

01:24:55.091 --> 01:24:56.824
a new Justice of the Peace
on our hands.

01:24:59.829 --> 01:25:01.462
Their lawyer's gotten
a change of venue

01:25:01.464 --> 01:25:03.263
from Gallatin to Boone County.

01:25:03.265 --> 01:25:04.565
Another trial's not gonna help

01:25:04.567 --> 01:25:06.867
if he's afraid
to plead their case.

01:25:08.571 --> 01:25:10.871
He's not one you should accuse
of being afraid.

01:25:10.873 --> 01:25:14.708
He's risked his job,
his reputation,

01:25:14.710 --> 01:25:17.177
even his life for these men
on more than one occasion.

01:25:18.647 --> 01:25:21.482
Alexander Doniphan's got nothing
to prove to anyone.

01:25:22.885 --> 01:25:25.619
Governor Boggs thinks
that Boone County

01:25:25.621 --> 01:25:28.255
will be safer than Gallatin.
Or here.

01:25:29.758 --> 01:25:31.692
Likely to change the ruling.

01:25:34.130 --> 01:25:37.164
How does the state,
in a course of four months,

01:25:37.166 --> 01:25:41.201
go from protecting the Mormons
with the militia

01:25:41.203 --> 01:25:43.770
to signing an executive order
to have them killed?

01:25:43.772 --> 01:25:45.172
[sighs]

01:25:45.174 --> 01:25:47.241
Public opinion's
a funny thing, Sam.

01:25:48.544 --> 01:25:50.577
You try to do what's right
for the people,

01:25:50.579 --> 01:25:52.279
but you can never please
everyone.

01:25:52.281 --> 01:25:54.314
One side hates the other.

01:25:54.316 --> 01:25:59.620
Each is convinced that the other
is driven by selfishness,

01:26:00.523 --> 01:26:01.555
greed,

01:26:01.557 --> 01:26:03.190
corruption.

01:26:03.192 --> 01:26:04.658
Anything but the truth.

01:26:06.162 --> 01:26:08.662
But their voices
aren't the loudest.

01:26:08.664 --> 01:26:11.632
The loudest voice is that
of public opinion.

01:26:13.202 --> 01:26:16.503
It yells, shouts, threatens,

01:26:17.706 --> 01:26:20.340
and acts out
like an unfettered child,

01:26:20.342 --> 01:26:25.179
demanding whatever it feels,
regardless of logic.

01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:28.549
What are you trying to say?

01:26:30.586 --> 01:26:32.553
The state now thinks
they could be innocent.

01:26:32.555 --> 01:26:34.321
[Sam sighs]

01:26:34.323 --> 01:26:35.822
I don't know if they are.

01:26:35.824 --> 01:26:37.691
But I do know that you and I

01:26:37.693 --> 01:26:39.826
should not be getting ourselves
killed for these men.

01:26:39.828 --> 01:26:42.529
So you surrendered judgment
to the people.

01:26:43.566 --> 01:26:45.699
Our lives were being threatened.

01:26:45.701 --> 01:26:48.335
A mob becomes
the highest governing body?

01:26:48.337 --> 01:26:52.606
-Careful, Sam.
-I have innocent men in chains.

01:26:53.509 --> 01:26:54.875
You've done right, Sam.

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:57.211
Just get them to court
in Boone County,

01:26:57.213 --> 01:26:59.546
and you're done with them.
They're someone else's problem.

01:26:59.548 --> 01:27:01.682
You've done your job, Sam.

01:27:01.684 --> 01:27:03.283
You've done all that was asked.

01:27:06.488 --> 01:27:07.821
It's not enough.

01:27:09.959 --> 01:27:11.992
[fire crackling]

01:27:14.530 --> 01:27:17.798
[somber theme playing]

01:27:47.863 --> 01:27:49.496
[shouting]

01:27:49.498 --> 01:27:50.597
Calm down!

01:27:50.599 --> 01:27:51.898
Sam!

01:28:02.444 --> 01:28:04.011
O God, where art thou?

01:28:05.281 --> 01:28:08.348
Hey! Get back!
I want everyone calm!

01:28:08.350 --> 01:28:10.817
Calm down!

01:28:10.819 --> 01:28:14.021
And where's the pavilion
that covereth thy hiding place?

01:28:18.527 --> 01:28:20.627
You think I want to be here?!

01:28:27.002 --> 01:28:31.071
God, how long
shall thy hand be stayed

01:28:33.742 --> 01:28:37.577
and thine eye behold the wrongs

01:28:37.579 --> 01:28:41.315
of thy people
and of thy servants

01:28:42.918 --> 01:28:46.987
and thy ear be penetrated
with their cries?

01:28:46.989 --> 01:28:49.389
I have been accused
of being a traitor--

01:28:49.391 --> 01:28:51.591
[crying] How long shall
they suffer these wrongs

01:28:51.593 --> 01:28:53.060
and unlawful oppressions

01:28:54.863 --> 01:29:00.567
before thine heart
shall be softened

01:29:00.569 --> 01:29:01.935
towards them

01:29:03.472 --> 01:29:05.339
and thy bowels

01:29:05.341 --> 01:29:07.708
shall be moved
with compassion towards them?

01:29:07.710 --> 01:29:09.743
Public opinion
is a funny thing, Sam.

01:29:09.745 --> 01:29:11.611
Not a lot of people
are for you right now.

01:29:11.613 --> 01:29:13.747
Before you know it,
you don't know what to believe.

01:29:13.749 --> 01:29:15.849
Opinions are not truth.

01:29:15.851 --> 01:29:18.085
Stretch forth thy hand.

01:29:19.621 --> 01:29:24.391
And let thine anger
be kindled against our enemies.

01:29:24.393 --> 01:29:26.960
There comes a time when you
can't just sit there
and do nothing.

01:29:26.962 --> 01:29:29.363
It's not my job
to hold an innocent man.

01:29:31.767 --> 01:29:36.136
Remember thy suffering Saints,
O our God.

01:29:36.138 --> 01:29:38.004
[crying]

01:30:04.066 --> 01:30:06.767
[chains rattling]

01:30:17.780 --> 01:30:19.846
-I never meant for--
-[Joseph] Shh.

01:30:40.836 --> 01:30:42.502
Is there any

01:30:43.772 --> 01:30:45.806
mercy in the law?

01:30:52.948 --> 01:30:56.116
[soft theme playing]

01:30:57.186 --> 01:30:59.519
[crying]

01:31:11.733 --> 01:31:13.066
[Joseph] Peace.

01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:16.570
Peace be unto thy soul.

01:31:18.173 --> 01:31:21.908
Thine adversity
and thine afflictions

01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:24.110
shall be but a small moment.

01:31:28.484 --> 01:31:30.817
If thou art accused

01:31:31.854 --> 01:31:34.221
with all manner
of false accusations,

01:31:35.924 --> 01:31:40.026
if thine enemies
fall upon thee,

01:31:40.028 --> 01:31:42.662
and if thou shouldst be cast
into the pit

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:44.931
or into the hands of murderers,

01:31:49.171 --> 01:31:50.570
know thou

01:32:00.649 --> 01:32:02.582
that all these things

01:32:03.585 --> 01:32:05.252
shall give thee experience

01:32:07.689 --> 01:32:09.523
and shall be for thy good.

01:32:26.742 --> 01:32:28.842
Walls and irons.

01:32:28.844 --> 01:32:31.111
Calculated
to make the honest soul

01:32:31.113 --> 01:32:33.680
feel stronger
than the powers of hell.

01:32:47.729 --> 01:32:49.296
[rooster crows]

01:33:00.776 --> 01:33:02.242
Mr. Doniphan.

01:33:02.244 --> 01:33:03.610
Mr. Tillery.

01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:06.846
Wasn't planning
on seeing you today.

01:33:06.848 --> 01:33:08.181
Yep.

01:33:12.287 --> 01:33:15.722
Is it true that you risked
your job for these men?

01:33:15.724 --> 01:33:17.991
I took a stance.
Nothing more.

01:33:20.696 --> 01:33:22.295
[Sam] It would be best
if you stayed here.

01:33:22.297 --> 01:33:23.964
[Doniphan]
The job's not done

01:33:23.966 --> 01:33:25.865
till we get them to court
in Boone County.

01:33:25.867 --> 01:33:27.334
My men will handle it.

01:33:30.772 --> 01:33:31.738
Do you mind?

01:33:31.740 --> 01:33:33.306
Not at all.

01:33:35.010 --> 01:33:36.643
[keys rattle on table]

01:33:37.879 --> 01:33:39.312
[Doniphan] Food looks better.

01:33:41.149 --> 01:33:42.682
-Oh!
-[sloshing]

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.853
-[laughing]
-[Sam] It's not funny!

01:33:46.855 --> 01:33:49.356
You're going to miss that.

01:33:49.358 --> 01:33:51.758
I will miss nothing
about this place.

01:33:53.028 --> 01:33:54.394
Nor shall I.

01:33:58.967 --> 01:34:00.767
[Lyman coughing]

01:34:26.294 --> 01:34:28.395
You said that we'd get
out of here alive.

01:34:31.299 --> 01:34:33.433
At the time,
I found it hard to believe.

01:34:35.337 --> 01:34:39.139
No doubt that God has placed
you here for His purposes.

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:47.147
We all leave here changed men.

01:34:57.059 --> 01:34:58.458
[bucket clanks]

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:01.828
My men will be here any minute.

01:35:02.964 --> 01:35:05.231
We'll take you to Boone County.

01:35:05.233 --> 01:35:07.267
It's several days' journey.

01:35:08.737 --> 01:35:11.037
As prisoners of the state,

01:35:11.039 --> 01:35:12.806
you all need to be in irons.

01:35:16.344 --> 01:35:18.078
All of you.

01:35:18.080 --> 01:35:20.714
[Doniphan] I've arranged for
a militia escort to go with us.

01:35:20.716 --> 01:35:24.751
We will not require
any militia escort.

01:35:27.255 --> 01:35:28.822
We will trust in God alone.

01:35:28.824 --> 01:35:30.824
Joseph, they're
to ensure our protection.

01:35:32.027 --> 01:35:33.860
Here we go.

01:35:33.862 --> 01:35:38.298
If we rely on the guards,
we will be destroyed.

01:35:39.501 --> 01:35:41.134
It's time.

01:35:41.136 --> 01:35:43.103
There's a mob assembling.

01:35:43.105 --> 01:35:45.004
We gotta hurry.

01:35:45.006 --> 01:35:46.172
Your men coming?

01:35:46.174 --> 01:35:48.241
They'll be here within the hour.

01:35:48.944 --> 01:35:50.310
No.

01:35:51.980 --> 01:35:53.813
We will go now.

01:35:53.815 --> 01:35:55.181
Without 'em.

01:35:56.318 --> 01:35:59.285
Sam, those men out there
want them dead.

01:35:59.287 --> 01:36:02.122
Half-scared guards.

01:36:02.891 --> 01:36:05.325
Don't be alarmed. Okay?

01:36:06.161 --> 01:36:07.827
I know what I'm about.

01:36:15.771 --> 01:36:17.904
[shouting and whooping]

01:36:20.275 --> 01:36:23.510
[dramatic theme playing]

01:36:56.011 --> 01:36:58.144
Joseph Smith.

01:37:03.351 --> 01:37:06.386
No more walls or bars
to protect you.

01:37:07.389 --> 01:37:10.924
No sheriff to come and save you.

01:37:13.562 --> 01:37:17.564
Just a bunch of guilty murderers
trying to escape justice.

01:37:24.940 --> 01:37:27.473
If we are guilty,

01:37:27.475 --> 01:37:32.579
we refuse not to be punished
by the law.

01:37:32.581 --> 01:37:34.247
Oh, you are guilty.

01:37:35.851 --> 01:37:38.351
You come into Missouri
with all your thoughts and ideas

01:37:38.353 --> 01:37:40.987
about being a chosen people.

01:37:40.989 --> 01:37:42.856
Thinking you're better
than all of us!

01:37:42.858 --> 01:37:44.958
-That's enough!
-Oh, is it?

01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:46.326
Is that enough?

01:37:48.029 --> 01:37:51.364
We're done listening
to you, Joe Smith!

01:37:51.366 --> 01:37:53.333
We're done listening
to all of you!

01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:57.470
[Sam] Leave these men
alone, Neil!

01:37:57.472 --> 01:38:00.406
[Neil] These men aren't
under your protection anymore!

01:38:00.408 --> 01:38:01.941
He's right, Sam.

01:38:03.011 --> 01:38:04.410
You've done your duty.

01:38:07.949 --> 01:38:09.515
Is it the law you want?

01:38:12.187 --> 01:38:15.388
Is it justice you want?

01:38:19.995 --> 01:38:24.464
A mob of anonymous cowards

01:38:24.466 --> 01:38:27.033
gathering to attack the accused.

01:38:31.172 --> 01:38:32.639
Is that justice?

01:38:37.379 --> 01:38:39.913
Under the mandate
of the governor of this state,

01:38:39.915 --> 01:38:42.348
these men will be taken
to Boone County!

01:38:44.286 --> 01:38:47.153
Justice will be executed

01:38:47.155 --> 01:38:49.022
in a proper court of law.

01:38:50.625 --> 01:38:53.259
Any man who has
a problem with that

01:38:53.261 --> 01:38:54.694
can take it up with me.

01:39:16.117 --> 01:39:17.450
Well, I do.

01:39:20.488 --> 01:39:22.288
This worth it to you?

01:39:24.125 --> 01:39:25.692
Protecting these murderers?

01:39:28.530 --> 01:39:30.029
They killed my brother.

01:39:30.031 --> 01:39:32.532
Who murdered women and children.

01:39:33.268 --> 01:39:34.667
You were there.

01:39:38.573 --> 01:39:41.107
Killed by a farmer
who was protecting his family

01:39:41.109 --> 01:39:42.608
and his property!

01:39:45.647 --> 01:39:49.582
And you can switch things up,
make the events different.

01:39:50.518 --> 01:39:54.020
But truth is unchangeable.

01:39:55.991 --> 01:39:58.324
You watched over these men
for five months.

01:39:59.527 --> 01:40:01.995
Making them suffer
for what they've done.

01:40:04.532 --> 01:40:06.399
Now you want to die for them.

01:40:16.544 --> 01:40:18.611
Nobody needs to die today.

01:40:43.571 --> 01:40:45.071
We'll see about that.

01:40:45.073 --> 01:40:46.506
No!

01:40:49.210 --> 01:40:51.110
[groaning]

01:41:00.422 --> 01:41:03.523
Nobody needs to die today!

01:41:12.767 --> 01:41:15.168
You're a traitor, Sam Tillery!

01:41:15.170 --> 01:41:16.803
You always have been!

01:41:19.641 --> 01:41:21.808
You watch out,
I'll be coming for you!

01:41:23.344 --> 01:41:25.178
I'll be in Boone County!

01:41:35.356 --> 01:41:38.758
[soft theme playing]

01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:17.530
[whinnies]

01:42:34.582 --> 01:42:36.749
[Joseph] That's a fine animal
you got there.

01:42:38.253 --> 01:42:39.752
Her name's Medley.

01:42:39.754 --> 01:42:42.321
I paid $100 for her at auction.

01:42:42.323 --> 01:42:44.290
She's worth every bit of 125.

01:42:46.227 --> 01:42:47.560
Medley, huh?

01:42:47.562 --> 01:42:49.162
That's a good name.

01:42:54.702 --> 01:42:56.169
Whoa.

01:43:02.944 --> 01:43:05.578
Four days' journey
to the Mississippi from here.

01:43:08.616 --> 01:43:10.583
Do you think
your friends are there?

01:43:10.585 --> 01:43:11.918
[irons clank]

01:43:12.754 --> 01:43:14.453
[Joseph]
God willing, yes.

01:43:14.455 --> 01:43:15.755
Never took you for a man

01:43:15.757 --> 01:43:18.691
who'd enjoy a drink
while on the job.

01:43:18.693 --> 01:43:20.259
It's no longer my job.

01:43:21.663 --> 01:43:22.895
It's my duty.

01:43:22.897 --> 01:43:24.297
This is my duty.

01:43:26.601 --> 01:43:30.369
You go to Boone County
for jury trial,

01:43:30.371 --> 01:43:32.905
you're gonna be found innocent
and set free.

01:43:33.942 --> 01:43:35.508
That's the idea.

01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:37.543
That's what we want.

01:43:37.545 --> 01:43:38.878
You know
what kind of aftermath

01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:40.980
that's gonna cause
in this state?

01:43:40.982 --> 01:43:42.915
Across the country?

01:43:44.519 --> 01:43:46.285
The people won't allow that.

01:43:51.459 --> 01:43:54.760
No. I think the best thing

01:43:54.762 --> 01:43:58.798
is for my men and I
to finish our drinks,

01:44:02.237 --> 01:44:04.303
take a nice, long rest.

01:44:06.374 --> 01:44:08.307
And then
you just be on your way.

01:44:18.653 --> 01:44:21.387
The governor
knows you're innocent.

01:44:21.389 --> 01:44:23.723
So does the sheriff and Turnham.

01:44:24.926 --> 01:44:27.393
-[Lyman] How?
-Everything.

01:44:27.395 --> 01:44:29.996
Sidney, the Saints,

01:44:31.532 --> 01:44:33.933
the militias,
the extermination order.

01:44:37.805 --> 01:44:42.608
So we flee,
and what comes of you?

01:44:42.610 --> 01:44:44.343
Your job, your reputation?

01:44:45.546 --> 01:44:47.680
It's better
that ten guilty escape

01:44:47.682 --> 01:44:49.782
than one innocent suffer.

01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:53.853
You read that in your book?

01:44:53.855 --> 01:44:56.656
"Blackstone's Law."

01:44:56.658 --> 01:44:59.692
That's what this is then,
an escape?

01:45:10.705 --> 01:45:12.338
125, right?

01:45:13.675 --> 01:45:15.007
Yes, sir.

01:45:17.712 --> 01:45:23.482
Okay. How about 150
with all the supplies?

01:45:23.484 --> 01:45:25.885
I'll make good on it
should you come see me.

01:45:26.587 --> 01:45:28.821
You have my word.

01:45:28.823 --> 01:45:32.091
Is that the word
of a prophet or a con man?

01:45:33.761 --> 01:45:35.795
Come see me, you'll find out.

01:45:40.368 --> 01:45:42.568
If I catch any of you
in Missouri again,

01:45:42.570 --> 01:45:44.503
I'll shoot you dead.

01:45:44.505 --> 01:45:46.906
You shoot any of us dead,

01:45:46.908 --> 01:45:48.808
I'll kill you
with my bare hands.

01:45:51.779 --> 01:45:53.412
Glad we're straight.

01:46:02.023 --> 01:46:04.423
You're four days' journey
to Quincy.

01:46:05.493 --> 01:46:06.492
Stay off the main roads.

01:46:06.494 --> 01:46:07.993
You'll find your way.

01:46:10.098 --> 01:46:11.564
Thank you, Sam.

01:46:11.566 --> 01:46:12.965
May you find yours.

01:46:17.071 --> 01:46:18.037
Let's go.

01:46:18.039 --> 01:46:19.805
Hyah.
