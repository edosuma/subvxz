00:00.620 --> 00:01.930
Previously on rescue me...

00:01.970 --> 00:04.670
I have something that I thought you
might be interested in, for your book.

00:04.710 --> 00:05.880
I wrote some poetry.

00:05.910 --> 00:08.400
I was thinking maybe I could drop
it by your place at some point.

00:08.430 --> 00:09.260
Ok.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.820
So are you saying I don't
have a shot at genevieve?

00:10.850 --> 00:12.510
Oh, you don't have a prayer.

00:12.530 --> 00:17.200
You don't have--you don't even have
a whisper of a wish with that broad.

00:17.220 --> 00:19.260
Your daughter katie...

00:19.940 --> 00:23.400
the reason you haven't been
seeing her around lately...

00:23.420 --> 00:25.220
she's in boarding school.

00:25.240 --> 00:27.880
I came here to talk about katie,
but I am not going to apologize.

00:27.900 --> 00:29.300
Come here.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.640
It's a big deal that she
wants us to go to this play.

00:31.670 --> 00:33.780
All right, all right, all right.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.650
What's
it-- When?

00:35.670 --> 00:37.410
Next weekend.

00:37.430 --> 00:40.560
You got no goddamn
respect for me, do you?

00:40.590 --> 00:44.490
Maybe you gotta be a real
asshole to be a good chief.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.450
Well, I guess we're gonna find that out.

00:46.470 --> 00:49.530
I didn't want to do this inside in front of
everybody, 'cause I knew you'd get all pissy.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.050
You won your chip.

00:51.060 --> 00:52.730
You've been sober a whole 12 months.

00:52.730 --> 00:55.010
Congratulations, tommy.

00:55.040 --> 00:57.310
Are you drinking?

00:57.330 --> 01:01.120
No, it's a little trick
I learned from my sponsor.

01:01.140 --> 01:05.660
So, um, how many times have
you been visited by your cousin?

01:05.680 --> 01:07.800
What do you want me to say?

01:07.820 --> 01:09.530
What if...

01:10.200 --> 01:12.420
you never see him again?

01:14.510 --> 01:16.910
Yeah.

01:26.200 --> 01:28.090
Let's go.

01:36.650 --> 01:38.730
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:38.750 --> 01:39.780
How's it going?

01:39.800 --> 01:40.310
Good.

01:40.330 --> 01:42.070
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:43.040 --> 01:44.610
How's drinking going?

01:44.630 --> 01:47.280
I'm not drinking.
What--what do you mean?

01:47.300 --> 01:48.720
- Where's your chip?
- Got it.

01:48.750 --> 01:49.500
- You got it?
- Yeah.

01:49.530 --> 01:51.630
- Let's see it.
- Oh, no, I don't have it on me.

01:51.650 --> 01:53.970
Remember, when you gave
it to me, I dropped it.

01:53.990 --> 01:55.160
Oh, oh.

01:55.180 --> 01:56.740
Thought that was a bad omen.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.470
Oh, anyway, I dropped by to tell you,

01:58.510 --> 02:00.570
you don't have to worry
about teddy anymore.

02:00.590 --> 02:01.630
He's drinking.

02:01.650 --> 02:03.230
I don't know. Probably.

02:03.260 --> 02:04.920
He's only been missing
for a couple of weeks.

02:04.940 --> 02:06.530
- Nobody can get a hold of him.
- Oh...

02:06.550 --> 02:08.360
Ellie's been going out of her
mind. Any of this ring a bell?

02:08.389 --> 02:10.770
I was--look, my kid--
my daughter was missing,

02:10.810 --> 02:13.740
so I was kind of, you
know, consumed by that.

02:13.750 --> 02:17.060
Her mother put her in school upstate.
I gotta go up and see her in a play.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.870
It's--got a pencil, poke
my eyes out, you know?

02:19.890 --> 02:22.560
- You want to hear about teddy or not?
- I guess I'm gonna, yeah.

02:24.970 --> 02:26.870
You know how he was banged
up after your father died?

02:26.880 --> 02:27.310
Right.

02:27.330 --> 02:30.260
Anyway, he figures your father fought in
the big one.He's gonna go to the memorial.

02:30.280 --> 02:31.860
He's gonna feel some
kind of connection, right?

02:31.880 --> 02:32.560
Yeah.

02:32.580 --> 02:34.020
He's in maryland or virginia,

02:34.050 --> 02:37.190
he's running around volunteering at
every single V.A.Hospital there is.

02:37.210 --> 02:39.670
Can you imagine, you're 110 years old,

02:39.710 --> 02:42.100
you fought for your country,
you got rid of hitler,

02:42.120 --> 02:43.490
and now teddy's coming
at you with a bedpan.

02:43.510 --> 02:46.630
I mean, you know there's guys down
there wishing they were back in okinawa.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.490
With adolph.

02:49.090 --> 02:51.520
Apparently your sister
maggie is down there with him.

02:51.540 --> 02:54.360
- She's into it 110%.
- Oh, that's great.

02:54.380 --> 02:57.270
Somebody should call arlington national
and tell them there's gonna be a rush.

02:57.900 --> 02:59.890
- I gotta go.
- I'll go with you.

03:02.080 --> 03:03.930
See you later, chief. I'm taking off.

03:03.940 --> 03:07.540
Shift ends at 4:00. It ain't 4:00 yet.

03:14.910 --> 03:17.320
It's 3:57.

03:17.350 --> 03:21.130
Well, guess that means you're here
another 3 minutes, now doesn't it?

03:21.600 --> 03:24.340
Shame I'm such an asshole now.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.270
What was that about?

03:29.290 --> 03:31.400
You don't want to know.

03:31.420 --> 03:32.470
Go to the play.

03:32.490 --> 03:35.130
You don't have any pencils, huh?

03:35.150 --> 03:38.030
As god as my witness, I am
telling you it is an epidemic.

03:38.050 --> 03:39.770
I agree.

03:39.800 --> 03:41.330
- Hey, mick, see you, buddy.
- Hey, see you, man.

03:41.350 --> 03:43.810
- Patrick dempsey from grey's anatomy.
- Oh, mcdreamy.

03:43.830 --> 03:45.290
No, mcdouchebag is more like it.

03:45.320 --> 03:46.690
- Marcia cross.
- Who in the hell is that?

03:46.710 --> 03:50.200
Oh, she plays the devious bree van
de camp on desperate housewives.

03:50.240 --> 03:51.160
Not that I watch it!

03:51.180 --> 03:53.700
- What are you guys talking about?
- Celebrities who've had twins.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.420
Not sex with twins,
you know, twin babies.

03:55.450 --> 03:58.600
Yeah, angelina jolie had
twins, and so did julia roberts.

03:58.620 --> 04:01.040
Puff daddy's girlfriend who,
believe it or not, is black.

04:01.070 --> 04:05.160
I wish I could really stay here and chat
with you guys, but I'm gonna get away.

04:05.170 --> 04:07.750
2 more minutes, gavin!

04:07.770 --> 04:09.300
How did he even hear me?

04:09.320 --> 04:10.980
Oh, god, I'm so full of
shit right now, really.

04:11.010 --> 04:12.300
Finally, a moment of self awareness?

04:12.320 --> 04:15.130
No, seriously, I haven't taken a shit
in like 5 days.I'm really backed up.

04:15.150 --> 04:19.149
And I feel like I got a, like, a
shit turducken sitting in my colon.

04:19.180 --> 04:22.450
Oh, what's a turducken,
dude?I get the turd part, but--

04:22.470 --> 04:23.600
It's a fancy poultry thing.

04:23.620 --> 04:26.550
It's a chicken jammed inside
a duck jammed inside a turkey.

04:26.590 --> 04:30.270
Yeah, except in my case, it's a shit jammed inside
a bigger shit jammed inside a really big shit.

04:30.290 --> 04:33.310
Ok, ok.I never thought I'd say this,
but can we go back to the twins?

04:33.310 --> 04:34.430
All right,
here's my theory--

04:34.450 --> 04:38.220
I think there is some guy with
this super twin-producing sperm

04:38.250 --> 04:40.850
running around hollywood
impregnating all these broads.

04:40.870 --> 04:41.800
Who, who is it?

04:41.830 --> 04:44.880
There's one way we can find
him--look for a guy with 4 balls.

04:48.230 --> 04:50.420
A minute, 12 seconds!

04:50.440 --> 04:52.740
Oh, it's unbelievable.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.560
4 balls, guys.How do you think
he deals with the chaffing issues?

04:55.570 --> 04:56.740
Well, I have another theory.

04:56.760 --> 05:00.480
And that theory involves the fact that I think
this guy put some of his celebrity baby money

05:00.510 --> 05:04.120
into the design and construction
of a special ball harness.

05:04.150 --> 05:05.350
Ooh, like a basket.

05:05.380 --> 05:06.640
No, more like a cradle.

05:06.670 --> 05:09.290
- Like a ball hammock.
- Ah, a hammock.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.840
And with that, gentlemen,
I bid you adieu.

05:11.850 --> 05:13.540
See ya.

05:21.180 --> 05:22.650
How--how did
you even do that?

05:22.670 --> 05:24.240
I don't give away my secrets.

05:24.260 --> 05:26.640
It's how I can keep
you assholes in line.

05:26.670 --> 05:29.310
10 more seconds.

05:30.690 --> 05:32.130
5.

05:34.990 --> 05:37.450
- You can go.
- Yeah?

05:37.470 --> 05:38.710
Maybe I don't want to go.

05:38.730 --> 05:40.860
This is it--I'm
crowning!

Me Season 5 Episode 07</font>

06:36.510 --> 06:38.730
No, I don't know what
kind of a play it is.

06:38.760 --> 06:41.730
Something about a family, I think,
and katie is one of the leads.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.250
- All right.
- That's all I know.

06:43.270 --> 06:44.580
Just tell me it's not a musical, ok?

06:44.610 --> 06:46.120
'Cause if it's a
musical, I swear to god,

06:46.140 --> 06:48.480
I'm going to find a big
tree and drive right into it.

06:48.510 --> 06:50.360
Oh, and colleen is
heartbroken, you know.

06:50.390 --> 06:51.390
Did you talk to the boyfriend?

06:51.420 --> 06:55.170
No, he hasn't called anybody, and he
hasn't shown up to work in like 2 weeks.

06:55.180 --> 06:58.670
Yeah, well, he gave her the
"it's not you, it's me" speech.

06:58.700 --> 06:59.960
She said that everything was going well.

06:59.990 --> 07:03.700
They had sex one time, and then
it just-- it all fell apart.

07:03.730 --> 07:05.000
So our plan worked.

07:05.020 --> 07:08.290
Maybe she was just really bad at it.

07:08.310 --> 07:10.680
It's not a possibility.

07:10.710 --> 07:12.180
Why?

07:12.210 --> 07:13.760
'Cause I taught her a few things.

07:13.780 --> 07:15.090
You--are you telling
me you sat her down?

07:15.130 --> 07:17.290
What did you teach
her?What did--

07:17.310 --> 07:18.700
You know, maybe we ought
to change the subject.

07:18.720 --> 07:22.540
Yeah, new, uh, new page.

07:24.180 --> 07:27.090
So how's the not drinking going?

07:27.730 --> 07:31.170
I just got my
year-- my year chip.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.490
- Tthat's great.
- Yes.

07:33.520 --> 07:35.770
Oh, my god, I'm so proud of you.

07:35.790 --> 07:37.610
- You should be so proud of you.
- I am.

07:37.630 --> 07:39.830
It is so amazing.

07:39.830 --> 07:43.000
I also started drinking
again, but let me explain.

07:43.020 --> 07:44.870
And that is so stupid!

07:44.890 --> 07:46.890
It's not stupid. I figured it out.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.550
I have a system. I can control it.

07:48.570 --> 07:50.600
You are not having one goddamn drink

07:50.620 --> 07:52.760
- the entire goddamn weekend.
- Not a problem, not a problem.

07:52.780 --> 07:54.320
Like I said, I can control it. Done.

07:54.350 --> 07:55.520
- Oh, my god.
- Easy.

07:55.550 --> 07:56.360
Oh, my god, you are going to ruin this.

07:56.390 --> 07:58.140
Easy, easy.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.720
Ok, you know what?

08:00.740 --> 08:03.430
Everything that we do this weekend
is going to reflect on katie.

08:03.460 --> 08:04.290
I understand that.

08:04.310 --> 08:05.970
Ok, so here's what
you're going to do--

08:05.990 --> 08:08.810
you are going to act like
you have some manners.Ok?

08:08.840 --> 08:12.730
And like you have actually been outside
the firehouse and you've had an education.

08:12.760 --> 08:16.480
I just want her to be in
a non-toxic environment.

08:17.480 --> 08:18.530
Ok.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.400
What's with the dress, by the way?

08:20.420 --> 08:22.430
That part of the non-toxic thing?

08:22.440 --> 08:26.300
I got an email last week from
katie requesting that I wear this.

08:26.330 --> 08:30.070
'Cause, you know what, she's
catching your disease-- pretending.

08:30.110 --> 08:31.870
She wants you to have the disease now.

08:31.890 --> 08:35.150
Because she wants you to wear
khakis, a polo, and a blazer.

08:35.179 --> 08:37.360
Really? Did you bring those?

08:37.380 --> 08:38.450
- Yeah.
- Good.

08:38.470 --> 08:39.880
'Cause when we get to the inn,
you know what I want you to do?

08:39.909 --> 08:42.630
I want you to take them out and

08:42.650 --> 08:43.880
make sure there's no wrinkles in them,

08:43.900 --> 08:48.420
and then put them on over the
goddamn non-toxic dress, ok?

08:48.450 --> 08:50.790
Will you please do it for katie?

08:52.210 --> 08:55.120
Let me ask you about
this dwight thing, ok?

08:55.150 --> 08:58.050
Oh, I knew we were gonna go here.

08:58.070 --> 08:59.100
Seriously.

08:59.130 --> 09:02.350
I mean, you want to talk to somebody about
not drinking, maybe you should talk to him.

09:02.380 --> 09:04.420
Alcoholic, pill-head
junkie in a wheelchair.

09:04.450 --> 09:06.260
He's got a major drinking
problem going on, ok?

09:06.280 --> 09:07.540
And I got news for you, too.

09:07.560 --> 09:12.290
Any guy can go for a long time if he
has no sensation in his dick, all right?

09:12.320 --> 09:14.740
That's--that's
pathetic.

09:14.760 --> 09:20.220
Ok?My relationship with dwight has
nothing to do with his longevity.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.750
Really? Then what's it based on, then?

09:21.790 --> 09:24.260
- Explain it to me, 'cause
I-- - He makes me laugh.

09:24.270 --> 09:26.850
Ok.When? When he falls out of the chair?

09:26.870 --> 09:29.700
Let's not talk the rest of the trip, ok?

09:29.720 --> 09:32.860
- Yeah, you know what, let's not!
- Right.

09:32.890 --> 09:34.250
Fine.

09:37.760 --> 09:41.560
Do me a favor, will
you? If you could, just

09:41.590 --> 09:45.950
sum up the reason you're with
this guy in like one word.

09:45.980 --> 09:48.680
- What would it be?
- Cock.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.670
You know, see that big tree right there?

09:51.690 --> 09:54.380
I'm going to drive into
it, right into that, ok?

09:54.400 --> 09:56.140
You know, it's funny
you would mention that,

09:56.170 --> 09:58.970
'cause that tree reminds me of him.

10:04.190 --> 10:07.430
- You ok, lou?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10:07.450 --> 10:10.270
Just having an acute
in vino veritas moment.

10:10.300 --> 10:11.840
Yeah.

10:11.860 --> 10:13.900
I don't follow. In vitro what?

10:13.920 --> 10:15.590
In vino veritas.

10:15.620 --> 10:17.480
In wine, truth.

10:17.510 --> 10:21.050
Or in this case, cheap,
watered down vodka.

10:21.630 --> 10:24.720
It's the realization
that tommy was right.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.210
You know, I got...

10:26.240 --> 10:30.230
I got no shot, nor have I ever
had a shot with the fair genevieve.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.340
You want to bang the french chick.

10:31.360 --> 10:34.350
Well, you know, yeah, you can do it a
little more poetically, franco, but, yes.

10:34.390 --> 10:36.280
Have you told him?

10:37.700 --> 10:39.620
That would be a little obvious, I think.

10:39.650 --> 10:41.070
Learn from me, grasshopper.

10:41.090 --> 10:44.180
Oh, you know, I haven't had
one of those in a long time.

10:44.200 --> 10:45.580
Focus.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.920
She's a hot chick, right?

10:46.940 --> 10:50.400
Guys go for her all the time, and
they all play the same game, all right?

10:50.430 --> 10:53.150
They flirt, they bare their souls,

10:53.180 --> 10:56.380
they do almost everything except come right
out and tell her what they're really after.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.680
You do that, you'll be totally,

10:58.720 --> 11:01.830
almost grotesquely obvious, she'll
find it so goddamn refreshing,

11:01.860 --> 11:04.170
by the time she figures out she
really doesn't want to bang you,

11:04.200 --> 11:05.660
you'll be zipping up
and heading for the door.

11:05.690 --> 11:07.580
Should I do this in
person, or can I call?

11:07.600 --> 11:09.660
You only do it over the
phone if you're a pussy.

11:09.690 --> 11:13.170
Or if you feel like the actual
sight of you might queer the deal.

11:13.670 --> 11:15.380
- I'll call.
- Good idea.

11:15.410 --> 11:18.540
Yeah. In the meantime, can you
make me one of them grasshoppers?

11:18.570 --> 11:21.410
I want my breath to be nice
and minty when I do this.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.080
Yeah, you bet.

11:31.220 --> 11:35.730
So you're sure that katie said that she
was coming back to the room after rehearsal?

11:35.750 --> 11:36.850
Who?

11:36.880 --> 11:39.140
Katie. Our daughter.

11:39.170 --> 11:41.150
Isn't her name katherine?

11:41.180 --> 11:43.420
Yes. But we call her katie.

11:43.450 --> 11:45.700
Oh.She said her name was katherine.

11:45.730 --> 11:49.430
I love her so much. She's
the best roommate ever.

11:49.460 --> 11:50.340
Oh!

11:50.360 --> 11:52.110
And she tells us all about you guys.

11:52.130 --> 11:52.790
Oh.

11:52.810 --> 11:56.010
You have a job with a hedge fund,
and you're a fashion designer.

11:56.030 --> 11:58.990
And she tells us all about
your gigantic loft in soho,

11:59.020 --> 12:01.150
and all the people you
know, and the parties.

12:01.180 --> 12:02.880
And your summer house in montauk.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.990
I've never been to
montauk. What's it like?

12:07.120 --> 12:08.670
- Nice.
- Nice.

12:09.920 --> 12:13.160
So look, I'm just going to
come right out and say this, ok?

12:13.190 --> 12:18.740
You're a very attractive
woman and I am-- well...

12:18.760 --> 12:23.850
a little-- you know what, let's
not even talk about what I am.

12:23.880 --> 12:25.620
This isn't easy.

12:25.650 --> 12:27.960
Especially since I've got people
like tommy gavin in my life

12:27.990 --> 12:32.390
telling me that I've got no possible
shot with you, but be that as it may...

12:35.680 --> 12:40.330
I find you extremely attractive, and I would
like to take our relationship to a physical place.

12:40.370 --> 12:44.690
I'm going to give you
a moment now to laugh.

12:47.410 --> 12:49.530
What?

12:50.070 --> 12:55.440
Wait a minute, did you just say--was that
actually you talking, or was it the grasshopper?

12:55.460 --> 12:59.450
No, it's a drink. I'll
explain it when I see you.

13:00.170 --> 13:02.100
Well, yes, I can.

13:02.110 --> 13:07.720
Yeah.I just gotta shave and shower and attach
my head to a new body and then find a new head.

13:07.740 --> 13:09.350
20 minutes!

13:09.380 --> 13:11.120
Yes!

13:11.160 --> 13:14.190
Yes!Franco! You are genius!

13:15.420 --> 13:16.710
I love ya.

13:18.650 --> 13:22.010
That is minty. I gotta try one of those.

13:23.240 --> 13:26.360
- Montauk?
- It's on long island.

13:26.380 --> 13:28.480
We know where it is, honey.

13:29.550 --> 13:31.660
And what's with the hedge fund?

13:31.680 --> 13:33.940
The closest I ever came to
a hedge was the time I was

13:33.970 --> 13:38.130
working as a landscaper
summertime during high school.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.840
Are you ashamed to tell people
that your dad's a firefighter?

13:40.860 --> 13:42.400
It's not right to
make up stories, katie.

13:42.430 --> 13:44.920
- That's right.
- Katherine, mommy.I told you.

13:44.940 --> 13:48.640
Ok, do you want us to throw a little
hepburn at the end of katherine?

13:48.670 --> 13:52.910
And mummy, mummy's the villain that
brendan fraser chases in the movies.

13:52.940 --> 13:54.610
She's mom or ma.

13:54.640 --> 13:57.160
Why can't you tell people
the truth about your family?

13:57.180 --> 14:01.000
Oh, you mean how my parents
are divorced but not really?

14:01.030 --> 14:03.580
And my mother had a baby
with my father's brother,

14:03.610 --> 14:09.260
and my uncle went to jail after he shot
the drunk driver who killed my brother?

14:10.060 --> 14:12.040
Well, she's got us on that one.

14:12.070 --> 14:13.700
Ok, let's just talk about happy things.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.320
Whoa, what's with the pda?

14:16.350 --> 14:17.470
What?

14:17.500 --> 14:19.040
What, did you give her
one of those phones?

14:19.070 --> 14:22.110
It means public displays of affection?

14:22.130 --> 14:24.400
Where are his pants and his blazer?

14:24.430 --> 14:26.680
I will make sure he
wears it to the play.

14:26.690 --> 14:28.870
Well, I'm not gonna wear
the pants--ow, honey!

14:28.900 --> 14:30.800
Hey, shh! Keep it down!

14:30.830 --> 14:34.210
- There are people here.
- All right!Ok.Ok.

14:35.020 --> 14:37.460
Did I tell you I'm
going skiing this winter?

14:37.480 --> 14:39.840
Lucy walters, she's like
my newest best friend.

14:39.860 --> 14:42.260
Her parents have a place
near sugar bush in vermont.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.600
They're taking me up
there during winter break.

14:44.620 --> 14:46.600
Have you guys ever skied before?

14:46.620 --> 14:48.130
I didn't think so.

14:48.160 --> 14:51.200
That's the art center over there. That's
where we're doing the play tomorrow night.

14:51.220 --> 14:53.010
Keep up, keep up! Ok. Y&v_ ux_o]BwxxpxXççxç`hh@y@@ppppy@@i@0ú`@ boston lager continues to be a very special beer. I brewed the first batch in my kitchen and it was the best beer I'd ever tasted. The first year it was entered in the great american beer festival boston lager was picked as the best beer in america. And the whole company was three people. No one had tried an american beer that had that kind of flavor. Sam adams really got the whole craft beer movement going. Twenty years on, jim is still obsessed with boston lager. You can taste that passion in every glass. It's 25 years later, and sam adams lager continues to win medals all over the world. That's pretty cool. since 1862, the best mojitos have always been made the same way. Please drink responsibly. Have you been told

14:56.600 --> 14:58.610
- Welcome to the blueberry cottage.
- Hey.

14:58.640 --> 14:59.770
Is this your first time with us?

14:59.800 --> 15:01.110
- Yes.
- Yep.

15:01.140 --> 15:04.240
Super.Breakfast is served
from 6:30 till 9:00,

15:04.260 --> 15:07.550
and we have a special gourmet
dinner for our guests on fridays,

15:07.580 --> 15:09.590
which would be tonight, so lucky you.

15:09.620 --> 15:11.340
- Great.
- Great, I'm starving.

15:11.370 --> 15:15.160
You're in room 6, blueberry pie.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.850
All our rooms are named
after blueberry desserts.

15:17.860 --> 15:21.690
We have some nice antiques in that
room, and a view of the herb garden.

15:21.710 --> 15:22.430
Ooh, wow.

15:22.450 --> 15:25.900
Um, I believe there's another
key for the second room.

15:25.930 --> 15:29.900
Uh, no, I only have mr.
And mrs. Thomas gavin.

15:29.920 --> 15:31.170
I just assumed
that would be one--

15:31.200 --> 15:34.530
- See, we're sort of divorced.
- We never filed.

15:34.550 --> 15:36.050
Yeah.I mean,
it's not--

15:36.080 --> 15:39.730
we get along and everything,
great. She's got a new boyfriend.

15:39.750 --> 15:42.840
We are full tonight, as I said.

15:42.870 --> 15:46.160
I could call down the street
to the fox and the lamb.

15:46.180 --> 15:48.550
I think they're full up, too.

15:49.530 --> 15:53.520
I--uh, let me talk
to my wife. Excuse me.

15:53.540 --> 15:55.040
Thank you.

15:55.060 --> 15:56.560
All right.

16:01.380 --> 16:03.530
What?

16:03.550 --> 16:04.230
What?

16:04.260 --> 16:07.150
It's going to kill you
if we spend one night--

16:08.040 --> 16:10.330
No, I'm afraid we're stuck.

16:10.360 --> 16:12.360
There's a lot going on in town tonight.

16:12.370 --> 16:14.200
You know what,
it's-- it's fine.

16:14.220 --> 16:15.490
We'll take the room, the one room.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.620
- You sure?
- Yeah, right?

16:17.640 --> 16:18.810
- It's one night.
- That's right.

16:18.840 --> 16:20.120
It's one night.

16:20.140 --> 16:21.580
Remember, she's got a boyfriend!

16:21.600 --> 16:22.980
- Yes, she does!
- Ha ha.

16:23.010 --> 16:24.880
Who's paralyzed.

16:25.420 --> 16:26.800
You know, his thing still works.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.430
Are you kidding me?!

16:28.460 --> 16:31.840
I--I had--I was--I
had a joke, and...

16:32.960 --> 16:34.600
Oh-- I'm
sorry, sir.

16:34.630 --> 16:37.180
I'll, uh, bring your bags out.

16:37.210 --> 16:38.310
Thank you.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.700
We'll be serving dinner soon. The
other guests are in the dining room.

16:40.730 --> 16:41.620
You can head right in.

16:41.650 --> 16:43.110
I think we'll just go right in.Starving.

16:43.140 --> 16:44.770
- Unless you want to change.
- No, no, we'll go right in.

16:44.790 --> 16:47.500
- You'll be changing.
- Honey, it's--

16:47.520 --> 16:49.680
Tommy, you're changing.

16:50.320 --> 16:52.650
- Can you give us a moment?
- Sure.

17:02.510 --> 17:04.560
we're gonna go change.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.079
Thank you.

17:06.099 --> 17:07.930
Oh, sure.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.770
Thank you.

17:11.440 --> 17:14.250
Oh, and then there were
eight. Welcome aboard.

17:15.030 --> 17:16.190
How you doing?

17:16.210 --> 17:18.550
Tommy gavin, my wife janice.

17:18.579 --> 17:21.319
I'm dick mcnamara, this
is my lovely wife kelly.

17:21.339 --> 17:23.200
Our two girls go to darcy hill academy.

17:23.230 --> 17:26.930
Oh, our daughter katherine
also goes there, seventh grade.

17:26.950 --> 17:31.020
Our girls are in seventh, heather
and prue, short for prudence.

17:31.040 --> 17:34.090
We're sitting girls
against the boys, so,

17:34.120 --> 17:35.140
you'll be with us over here.

17:35.170 --> 17:37.470
And that means you
sit right there, scout.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.110
Ok.

17:39.130 --> 17:42.400
Adam and lenora white from new
york city, nice to meet you.

17:42.420 --> 17:43.980
Hi.Ok,
so--

17:44.000 --> 17:46.470
How are you? Just a
couple of city dwellers.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.870
What part of town are you in?

17:47.890 --> 17:52.410
Uh, we're splitting our time between

17:52.450 --> 17:54.210
bronx and queens.

17:54.220 --> 17:56.500
Oh, I thought you were in the city.

17:56.540 --> 17:59.390
Oh, did they--
did they move...

17:59.420 --> 18:00.890
the burroughs or something?

18:00.920 --> 18:03.690
Oh, I'm sorry, it's just that when
you said you lived in the city,

18:03.720 --> 18:05.940
I assumed you meant manhattan.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.370
Well, I mean manhattan, you really
can't afford to live in there now

18:09.400 --> 18:11.520
unless you're euro trash or homos...

18:11.540 --> 18:14.370
exual people, you know, which is,

18:14.390 --> 18:20.390
hey, you know, we've got a
homosexual at work who's great guy.

18:20.970 --> 18:23.000
Right, honey? You met him.

18:23.030 --> 18:24.330
Great guy.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.740
Jim and kathy king.

18:27.760 --> 18:28.500
- Hi.
- Hi.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.450
Nice to meet you.

18:29.470 --> 18:31.750
- Hi, hi.
- So jim and kathy.

18:32.530 --> 18:34.400
That's a lot of names to remember.

18:34.420 --> 18:36.460
You said your name was gavin?

18:36.480 --> 18:39.540
Prue introduced us to
katherine a couple weekends ago.

18:39.550 --> 18:41.740
Oh, katie. Katherine, katie, ha.

18:41.760 --> 18:43.370
Your ears must have been burning.

18:43.390 --> 18:46.950
We heard all about your loft and
about the weekend place in montauk.

18:46.980 --> 18:49.280
Oh, montauk is wonderful.

18:49.300 --> 18:52.660
We talked about getting a place
there, but it's a little remote.

18:52.680 --> 18:55.750
But the people are normal,
not like those hampton types.

18:56.290 --> 18:57.760
By that I mean jews.

18:57.790 --> 18:59.000
I can say that.

18:59.020 --> 19:00.760
We're jewish. Oh!

19:00.780 --> 19:02.640
And they let you into connecticut?

19:08.990 --> 19:11.720
And which hedge fund are you with?

19:11.740 --> 19:12.890
Me?

19:12.910 --> 19:15.310
Oh, I'm, uh...

19:15.330 --> 19:21.280
you know, my katherine, katie, you
know how kids tend to exaggerate.

19:21.300 --> 19:23.410
They're a little embarrassed
about their parents.

19:23.440 --> 19:24.150
Not our kids.

19:24.180 --> 19:25.600
- Not ours.
- Nor ours.

19:25.620 --> 19:27.810
- Except for the jewish thing.
- A little.

19:27.820 --> 19:33.610
Anyways, I'm not with the hedge fun.
I'm with the, uh, firemen's fund.

19:35.840 --> 19:38.690
I'm a fireman--I'm
a fireman.

19:38.710 --> 19:40.090
- I'm fdny.
- Oh, oh.

19:40.120 --> 19:43.010
Yeah.Well, it is a
pleasure to meet you, sir.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.320
A fireman, that's great.

19:45.350 --> 19:48.330
If I never see another hedge
fund asshole, it'll be too soon.

19:50.740 --> 19:52.900
I work for a hedge fund.

19:52.910 --> 19:54.230
You know what I mean.

19:54.250 --> 19:56.730
Can I tell you, I wanted
to be a fireman as a kid.

19:56.760 --> 19:57.790
- Really?
- Who didn't?

19:57.820 --> 19:59.710
- But this guy actually did it.
- Yeah.

19:59.730 --> 20:02.250
Now, I don't know how you
got away with wearing jeans.

20:02.280 --> 20:05.100
If I tried wearing jeans tonight, she
would have locked me up in my room.

20:05.130 --> 20:08.010
Hey, no kidding. You are our hero.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.390
- Tom, was it?
- Tommy.

20:09.410 --> 20:10.280
- Tommy.
- Just call me tommy.

20:10.300 --> 20:12.850
Tommy.Barkeep, get this man a drink.

20:12.870 --> 20:14.400
Right away, sir.

20:14.900 --> 20:20.010
So, jane, should we assume
you're not a fashion designer?

20:20.020 --> 20:21.570
I'm janice.

20:21.590 --> 20:25.530
And, no, I am a fashion designer.

20:25.550 --> 20:26.910
Ha ha.

20:26.930 --> 20:28.760
Can I get a drink, too, honey?

20:28.780 --> 20:30.020
Hey, it's me.

20:30.050 --> 20:31.710
I've showered and shaved,

20:31.730 --> 20:33.960
although I'm sure you've
probably changed your mind by now,

20:33.980 --> 20:35.920
but I was just kind
of hoping that--

20:43.410 --> 20:45.010
Is that a new dress?

20:45.030 --> 20:47.070
- Oh, yes.
- It's adorable.

20:47.100 --> 20:48.180
Thank you.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.080
You know, I'm a little confused.

20:50.100 --> 20:54.490
I mean, it looks new, but it's
definitely last season's design.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.430
Not that I wear that designer.

20:57.450 --> 21:00.230
The girl who cleans my house does.

21:04.040 --> 21:07.710
- Could I get another drink, please?
- Yeah.

21:07.730 --> 21:11.810
I don't think you want to drink too much,
darling, you've got to protect your figure.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.680
That's lipo, right?

21:13.700 --> 21:15.020
Excuse me?

21:15.050 --> 21:17.360
Well, you've obviously had lipo.

21:17.390 --> 21:19.780
Nobody our age is that thin.

21:24.670 --> 21:29.290
If you'll excuse me, I
need to go to the bathroom.

22:15.050 --> 22:17.600
Well, I think we know
why you're so skinny?

22:18.940 --> 22:20.770
I'm sorry, what was that?

22:20.810 --> 22:23.480
I don't want to embarrass you, hon, but

22:23.500 --> 22:26.240
you're eating with your seafood fork.

22:26.270 --> 22:29.950
That's the fork you were supposed
to use for the crab cocktail.

22:29.980 --> 22:33.700
Well, I guess they're not serving
much seafood in montauk these days.

22:36.430 --> 22:38.800
Could you repeat that, sweetheart?

22:38.820 --> 22:42.790
'Cause I couldn't hear
you. Because you're so fat.

22:42.800 --> 22:44.080
Excuse me?

22:44.090 --> 22:46.250
Oh, no, there is no excuse for you.

22:46.280 --> 22:49.340
Because what you are is a bitch.

22:49.370 --> 22:51.120
Hey, hon, maybe we should...

22:51.140 --> 22:52.240
call it a night.

22:52.260 --> 22:54.270
Great idea, darling.

22:54.290 --> 22:57.300
I'm sure there's an A.A.Meeting
somewhere in the neighborhood.

22:57.320 --> 22:59.210
What?

22:59.230 --> 23:02.220
- I was just joking.
- Yeah.

23:02.240 --> 23:06.070
Did you hear the one about the preppy
asshole who got the fireman's foot up his ass?

23:06.090 --> 23:07.550
That one ring a bell?

23:07.570 --> 23:10.280
Your wife might have a problem.

23:10.310 --> 23:14.290
Yeah, my wife always has a problem
when she's surrounded by douchebags!

23:16.300 --> 23:19.410
My wife doesn't tend to
get shitfaced a lot, but

23:19.440 --> 23:24.480
if she does get shitfaced, she
usually has a good goddamn reason.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.090
Thank you, sweetie.

23:26.110 --> 23:28.810
- Shall we?
- We shall.

23:34.090 --> 23:37.720
I'm sorry that you guys
don't like what I'm wearing,

23:37.750 --> 23:40.030
and I'm sorry that I
am too thin for you.

23:40.050 --> 23:44.120
And I am sorry that all of
your husbands checked out my ass

23:44.140 --> 23:46.060
when I went to the bathroom.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.960
And that's right, I saw you.

23:48.990 --> 23:50.490
I don't know what she's talking about.

23:50.500 --> 23:51.820
Oh, adam, shut up.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.290
Don't blame us because you
made a fool of yourself.

23:54.320 --> 23:55.990
Oh, is that right, tubby?

23:56.450 --> 24:01.360
You know, I guess when people are
looking that far down their noses at you,

24:01.380 --> 24:04.510
you want to give them
a good goddamn show.

24:04.530 --> 24:07.660
Yeah, you like it?

24:07.700 --> 24:09.730
I think we can go.

24:11.340 --> 24:13.280
You know what, I'm not a designer,

24:13.310 --> 24:15.670
but here's a
fashion tip for you--

24:15.690 --> 24:17.660
never wear yellow.

24:17.670 --> 24:20.950
Because kids might try
to ride you to school.

24:23.480 --> 24:26.120
- Let's go, tommy.
- Come on, that was funny.

24:27.110 --> 24:28.450
Whatever.

24:28.470 --> 24:30.490
All right.

24:34.220 --> 24:38.330
Oh, my god, those stuffy bitches!

24:38.350 --> 24:39.880
Yeah, what a bunch of assholes.

24:39.900 --> 24:42.460
- That was great.
- Yeah.

24:42.480 --> 24:46.200
Oh, my god. We kicked ass!

24:46.220 --> 24:48.430
Ha ha ha!

24:48.460 --> 24:51.370
Oh, baby, and thank you
for coming to my defense.

24:51.390 --> 24:53.690
- Yeah.
- That was so nice.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.720
Honey...

24:58.730 --> 25:01.290
what--what
are you doing?

25:01.310 --> 25:03.310
I'm doing the victory dance.

25:03.330 --> 25:06.480
I got you, but what are you wearing?

25:06.500 --> 25:09.450
Oh, come on, tommy, you've
seen me in this a million times.

25:09.480 --> 25:12.570
Yeah. I have, I have.

25:12.590 --> 25:15.550
Forgot how see-through
the t-shirts can be.

25:15.580 --> 25:18.760
You know, I don't know if we ever
did it at an inn before, it's just--

25:18.780 --> 25:20.590
At the blueberry inn!

25:20.650 --> 25:24.620
Yeah, yeah, it's true.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.510
So what are--
what's--what's the thing?

25:26.540 --> 25:29.930
Oh, tommy, I'm drunk.

25:31.660 --> 25:35.250
But I'm certain of a
couple of one thing.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.420
Ok...

25:37.450 --> 25:40.710
We are not having sex.

25:40.730 --> 25:42.030
Right.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.770
I know that.

25:43.800 --> 25:45.790
Yeah, see, I know that.

25:45.820 --> 25:47.000
That's clear to me.

25:47.030 --> 25:51.220
But, ahem, my, uh, my...

25:51.240 --> 25:54.090
- Cock.
- Ha ha, your word.

25:54.110 --> 25:58.720
You know, I'm totally clear.I get it.My
brain has computed that fact that it's just--

25:58.740 --> 26:00.670
we're not doing that. But...

26:00.680 --> 26:02.360
my, uh,
ahem--

26:02.400 --> 26:05.900
- Cock, dick, schlang,
wang, wanger-- - Ok, stop.

26:05.930 --> 26:07.790
- Ok, yeah, see--
- Happy charlie.

26:07.820 --> 26:11.320
He he, happy charlie has
got a different brain.

26:11.340 --> 26:14.150
He's got his own brain, and
this visual for him is...

26:14.170 --> 26:15.830
arresting.

26:15.850 --> 26:18.420
Would
be--

26:18.440 --> 26:20.280
Where's the mini bar?

26:38.040 --> 26:39.980
- Oh, tommy?
- Yeah?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.190
Here.

26:41.220 --> 26:42.530
Oh. Yeah.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.420
Are they having sex?

26:55.650 --> 26:58.190
I don't remember it sounding like that.

26:58.710 --> 27:00.480
Ever.

27:09.260 --> 27:15.980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah,
baby, yeah, baby!Oh, baby, oh, baby!

27:17.300 --> 27:19.380
- Honey...
- Aah!

27:22.720 --> 27:24.730
Are you ok? Hon?

27:24.760 --> 27:27.250
Yeah. Oh, tommy.

27:27.280 --> 27:28.810
Hey!

27:32.000 --> 27:34.050
You looking at my wife's ass?

27:37.690 --> 27:39.240
Where did you serve?

27:39.260 --> 27:42.110
Vietnam, but don't ask me for details.

27:42.120 --> 27:45.530
I was high as a kite my
entire tour, thank god.

27:45.550 --> 27:48.470
Can I get you something?
Maybe an extra pillow?

27:49.120 --> 27:50.710
How about a smoke?

27:50.730 --> 27:54.390
You're on oxygen! You'll take
out the entire goddamn building!

27:54.410 --> 27:57.040
I'm ready. I'm ready to go.

27:57.070 --> 28:00.340
Nah, you've got plenty of
fight left in you, I can tell.

28:01.120 --> 28:05.170
Wife's dead, 11 years.

28:06.340 --> 28:08.740
Hurts when I piss.

28:10.080 --> 28:12.480
When I breathe.

28:15.460 --> 28:18.070
Come here, kid.

28:18.990 --> 28:20.650
Kill me.

28:20.690 --> 28:22.540
I'll give you 3 grand.

28:22.560 --> 28:23.810
3 grand,
what--

28:23.840 --> 28:25.440
That's all I got.

28:26.640 --> 28:31.640
Hey, look, I'm here to offer support and
let you guys know you're not forgotten.

28:31.650 --> 28:36.210
I mean, just because
you want to call it quits

28:36.230 --> 28:38.490
doesn't mean I'm gonna let you.

28:39.510 --> 28:41.920
How about for 20 grand?

28:41.950 --> 28:44.090
You just told me you only had three!

28:44.110 --> 28:45.820
I like to bargain.

28:46.890 --> 28:49.180
I won't do it.

28:49.200 --> 28:52.230
Someday it'll be you in this bed.

28:52.250 --> 28:55.860
Someday you're gonna be
begging for an angel to come.

28:56.650 --> 29:00.180
Someday, it'll be you.

29:04.310 --> 29:07.840
You think it's possible
to die of shit poisoning?

29:07.850 --> 29:11.960
You know, like if your shit backs up and
you haven't shit for days and days and days,

29:11.980 --> 29:14.360
do you just, you know, die, or
does it have to come out eventually?

29:14.380 --> 29:16.860
'Cause if so, I'm gonna have
to invest in some ear plugs.

29:16.890 --> 29:19.850
Yeah, well, have you thought about
getting your kidneys checked out?

29:20.920 --> 29:22.110
What's that supposed to mean?

29:22.130 --> 29:24.230
I'm just saying, I think they got
something to do with your waste functions.

29:24.250 --> 29:25.790
You might have a problem, you know?

29:25.820 --> 29:27.700
Yeah, well, maybe you
got a problem, asshole.

29:27.720 --> 29:30.080
Talking about other
people'S...functions.

29:30.100 --> 29:32.050
- What are you, a doctor?
- You know I'm not, sean.

29:32.080 --> 29:34.410
Yeah, well, shut your mouth.

29:34.420 --> 29:37.000
Maybe you want to shut yours,
sean-O. Shit's starting to come out.

29:37.020 --> 29:38.760
Yeah, I wish.

29:38.770 --> 29:40.480
Oh, god.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.050
Hey. Captain lou.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.970
What's the official word
with you and frenchy, huh?

29:44.990 --> 29:48.130
Ooh, I think you'll find it
very interesting, my friend.

29:48.150 --> 29:51.050
I went over there and gained
access to her inner sanctum.

29:51.070 --> 29:52.950
Ah, yeah, you mean her vajayjay?

29:52.960 --> 29:54.250
No, her apartment.

29:54.270 --> 29:58.750
At which point she proceeded to tell
me how completely not her type i was,

29:58.780 --> 30:01.040
to the degree it was almost laughable.

30:01.070 --> 30:03.120
After which...

30:05.080 --> 30:08.550
she drew me into her bed
chamber and proceeded to ride me

30:08.570 --> 30:12.240
like a hairy middle-aged tilt-a-whirl
for upwards of an hour and 15 minutes.

30:12.260 --> 30:13.820
Wait a second, I'm confused.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.230
You said she said you
weren't her type, so...

30:15.250 --> 30:16.940
Totally! Totally not her type.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.380
But apparently at some point I
had mentioned that tommy had said

30:19.420 --> 30:21.850
that I had no shot with her, and
it seems that our mademoiselle

30:21.880 --> 30:23.990
doesn't really like
our mr. Gavin so much

30:24.020 --> 30:28.600
to the degree that she was willing to engage
me in a good old-fashioned grudge hump.

30:30.010 --> 30:31.030
And you're ok with that?

30:31.060 --> 30:32.670
Yeah, you know, I was
a little hurt at first,

30:32.690 --> 30:35.530
but then her top came off, and
I was goddamn great with it.

30:36.090 --> 30:37.720
Finally it's a win-win for old lou.

30:37.750 --> 30:40.240
I got a great piece of ass and
I get to rub tommy's nose in it.

30:40.270 --> 30:41.530
Yes!

30:42.120 --> 30:44.600
Yeah, but wait a second, how are you going
to prove it actually happened?You know,

30:44.620 --> 30:46.020
you tell him that story,
he ain't gonna believe it.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.670
I had her write me a note.

30:49.610 --> 30:52.910
All the details, plus a phone number
in case he wants to call and check in.

30:53.970 --> 30:54.980
Hey, can I get a sniff?

30:55.000 --> 30:56.520
No, no.

30:56.540 --> 30:58.010
It's gonna be a beautiful day.

30:59.100 --> 31:00.860
And it's gonna be a beautiful call.

31:03.110 --> 31:03.960
What's up, fellas?

31:08.730 --> 31:10.540
- We all clear now?
- All clear.

31:10.570 --> 31:12.360
And we're still looking
for water coming up dry.

31:12.380 --> 31:14.420
We got no choice. We
gotta let this one go.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.110
And me with no weenies.

31:16.130 --> 31:17.630
Where's garrity?

31:17.660 --> 31:19.240
Didn't he bring that old lady out?

31:19.260 --> 31:21.370
Yeah, but then he went back inside.
I passed him on the second floor.

31:21.390 --> 31:23.300
- When?
- I don't know, a couple minutes ago.

31:23.820 --> 31:26.860
Hey, garrity, what is your location?

31:27.690 --> 31:30.970
Sean garrity, what is your location?

31:30.990 --> 31:32.560
- Chief.
- What?

31:32.580 --> 31:33.890
We might have a mayday here.

31:33.910 --> 31:35.570
- What do you got, lou?
- Yeah, we got a member missing.

31:35.600 --> 31:37.580
It's garrity. I think
I'm gonna go back in.

31:37.590 --> 31:40.680
Jesus christ.All right, make it quick.
I'm gonna send the other crew in after you.

31:40.700 --> 31:43.330
Mayday, mayday, missing member.

31:43.350 --> 31:45.590
- Sean!
- Garrity!

31:45.610 --> 31:48.500
- Sean!
- Goddamn!

31:48.520 --> 31:50.470
- Sean!
- Sean!

31:50.480 --> 31:52.810
- Garrity, respond.
- What is your 20?

31:52.830 --> 31:54.770
Yeah, yeah, this is it, he was
headed in here last time I saw him.

31:54.790 --> 31:56.420
Garrity, hello!

31:56.450 --> 31:57.570
All right, guys, check the room out.

31:57.590 --> 31:59.230
Sean!

32:00.220 --> 32:02.410
Whoa, hey! I'm in here, do you mind?

32:02.450 --> 32:03.290
What the hell are you doing?

32:03.320 --> 32:05.830
I'm taking a shit for the
first time in like a year,

32:05.850 --> 32:07.340
so could you shut the
door for christ sake?

32:07.360 --> 32:09.490
Hey, douchebag, this whole
place is about to go up, ok?

32:09.510 --> 32:11.040
Ok, well, then you guys
better get a handle on it,

32:11.060 --> 32:12.480
'cause I'm not going anywhere, ok?

32:12.500 --> 32:15.080
- I'm stuck. -
Come on, we gotta--

32:15.100 --> 32:17.050
dude, what is that?

32:17.080 --> 32:18.620
That's the potpourri
coming out of my ass.

32:18.620 --> 32:21.030
Oh, my god, it's like
somebody dropped a net.

32:21.710 --> 32:22.900
Put your mask on, guys.

32:22.920 --> 32:24.110
You know what, come on.

32:24.130 --> 32:25.690
Jesus christ, I can still smell it.

32:25.700 --> 32:27.640
- I think it got in my tank.
- It's not that bad, asshole.

32:27.660 --> 32:30.450
Yes, it is.You ever light a match
to get rid of this shit smell?

32:30.470 --> 32:33.070
You got a whole building burning around
here, it's not even making a dent.

32:33.090 --> 32:35.960
We're gonna have to light the place next
door on fire, just to knock down the stink.

32:35.980 --> 32:37.370
- Shut the goddamn door.
- No, no.

32:37.400 --> 32:38.280
Lou, what's going on?

32:38.310 --> 32:40.360
Nothing!Jesus, would
you guys get out of here!

32:40.380 --> 32:43.300
So, amanda, are you
excited to see the play?

32:43.320 --> 32:44.440
I can't wait.

32:44.460 --> 32:47.070
Katie, she's the star of the
show, and I'm her roommate,

32:47.090 --> 32:49.380
so it's almost like I'm famous, too.

32:50.280 --> 32:51.550
So what do your parents do?

32:51.570 --> 32:54.730
My father owns a biotech firm.
My mother's in gene research.

32:54.760 --> 32:56.990
Really? Gene research.

32:57.010 --> 32:59.850
So does she work on lucky's or levi's?

33:01.440 --> 33:02.970
- You're funny.
- Thanks.

33:02.990 --> 33:05.370
He's funny. Now I know
why you're so funny.

33:05.390 --> 33:07.650
You must laugh all the time at home.

33:07.670 --> 33:10.200
Yeah, pretty much nonstop.

33:11.690 --> 33:14.030
I have to use the bathroom, excuse me.

33:14.050 --> 33:16.480
You're excused.

33:17.070 --> 33:18.980
Go with her, mommy.

33:19.000 --> 33:19.720
Why?

33:19.750 --> 33:22.610
She's got an eating disorder.
She barfs up everything.

33:22.630 --> 33:25.590
She won't do it if someone
else is in the bathroom.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.950
So how's school?

33:30.970 --> 33:35.250
It seems, you know-- your
mother and I were very

33:35.270 --> 33:37.210
impressed by the...

33:37.240 --> 33:39.120
What's going on?

33:40.310 --> 33:42.060
- Well-- - With
you and mom?

33:42.080 --> 33:44.900
You're being nice to each other.
You were holding hands yesterday.

33:44.920 --> 33:47.570
Well, honey, we're always-- we've
always been nice to each other.

33:49.380 --> 33:51.110
What?

33:51.840 --> 33:54.070
I just want to know,

33:54.090 --> 33:58.840
are you guys behaving because
you're at my school, or...

33:58.870 --> 34:01.500
you know, are things better?

34:01.540 --> 34:05.750
Well, I mean, you know, we
haven't--we've both been so busy,

34:05.780 --> 34:10.670
but it's been nice.I mean, driving
up here was great, and, you know, uh,

34:10.690 --> 34:13.679
we even stayed in the same
room together last night.

34:13.710 --> 34:15.139
And it was ok?

34:15.159 --> 34:17.650
Yeah, it was great.

34:18.739 --> 34:21.090
Are you guys gonna get back together?

34:21.120 --> 34:22.889
Honey...

34:23.790 --> 34:27.820
look, with
grown-ups--ahem--

34:27.840 --> 34:30.070
with adults...

34:31.620 --> 34:34.420
all right, you know,

34:34.440 --> 34:37.420
the best way I can think
to explain it, you know,

34:37.449 --> 34:42.100
you know how planets
orbit around the sun, ok?

34:42.130 --> 34:46.800
Your mother and I are like 2 planets.
Your mother's like the planet janet.

34:46.830 --> 34:48.370
Ok...

34:48.389 --> 34:52.179
And, you know, so we're orbiting
around the sun, which would be,

34:52.199 --> 34:55.230
you know, you two girls,
even though you're girls.

34:55.260 --> 34:56.630
What I'm saying
is like, some--

34:56.659 --> 34:59.750
the planets, sometimes they
go a long way around the sun.

34:59.770 --> 35:01.070
You know?But

35:01.100 --> 35:04.430
that's your mother and i sometimes,
we go a long way away from each other,

35:04.460 --> 35:08.440
but we always come back
together around that thing,

35:08.470 --> 35:11.740
the thing that keeps us, you know...

35:11.760 --> 35:15.430
If you guys got back
together and things were nice,

35:15.450 --> 35:17.540
I would come home more often.

35:17.580 --> 35:19.590
I really, really would, daddy.

35:19.610 --> 35:22.450
That would be great, honey.
That would be really great.

35:22.970 --> 35:25.390
I'm just glad that, you know,

35:25.430 --> 35:29.240
there's a chance that we might
sort of be like normal people again.

35:29.260 --> 35:33.110
Listen, whatever goes
on, your mother and I,

35:33.130 --> 35:35.950
what we want is for you and
colleen to be happy.That's our--

35:35.980 --> 35:39.360
that's the main thing, you know?

35:39.380 --> 35:41.000
It really is.

35:41.660 --> 35:44.010
Ok.I'm gonna go check on mom and amanda.

35:44.030 --> 35:45.440
Ok.

35:45.460 --> 35:46.740
Bye, sweetie.

35:49.440 --> 35:50.820
No puking.

35:55.600 --> 35:57.860
Look at you, huh?

35:57.890 --> 35:59.470
You know who you remind me of?

35:59.500 --> 36:00.590
Veronica lake.

36:00.620 --> 36:02.330
I don't look anything like her.

36:02.350 --> 36:03.700
To me you do.

36:04.740 --> 36:07.330
Did you ever make a movie?
Were you ever on stage?

36:07.360 --> 36:09.470
No, I mean, I did a play once.

36:09.500 --> 36:10.690
Tell me.

36:10.710 --> 36:12.640
We were doing south pacific.

36:12.670 --> 36:14.610
The musical.

36:14.630 --> 36:17.190
And I played one of the
nurses in the chorus.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.080
Did you wear a nurse's uniform?

36:19.100 --> 36:21.130
Well, yeah, in a couple of the scenes.

36:21.170 --> 36:23.490
But, you know, the story
took place on an island,

36:23.520 --> 36:25.050
in the south pacific, I guess,

36:25.070 --> 36:28.820
so most of the time I just
wore, like rolled up pants and,

36:28.850 --> 36:31.900
and, uh, bathing suit tops and stuff.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.370
But there was one night
that, this was pretty funny.

36:34.400 --> 36:37.760
We had to do a quick change
backstage between scenes.

36:37.780 --> 36:42.260
So the two teachers go backstage
and they hold up this big blanket.

36:42.280 --> 36:45.160
The boys had cut a huge hole
in the middle of the blanket,

36:45.180 --> 36:48.750
like you can see through a window,
all the way through to the other side.

36:48.760 --> 36:51.790
They got in so much trouble.

36:51.810 --> 36:54.070
Mr. Wills, are you masturbating?

36:54.870 --> 36:56.440
I'm trying.

36:59.040 --> 37:02.310
Well, at least let me turn my back.

37:03.600 --> 37:09.070
Anyway, they all got in so much trouble. They
all had to go down to the office the next day.

37:09.090 --> 37:12.840
Perhaps, major carlton, I
have not made myself clear.

37:12.870 --> 37:15.560
I didn't raise my daughters
to become the possessions

37:15.580 --> 37:19.510
or personal conquests of
the glorious military men.

37:19.530 --> 37:23.640
My annabelle may be blessed with,
as you put it, a pretty little head.

37:23.660 --> 37:28.130
But I assure you, the sight of a man in
uniform will never cause her to lose it.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.640
Good day, major.

37:29.660 --> 37:32.530
Yes, but if I can only speak
to annabelle for a moment...

37:32.550 --> 37:34.180
I said good day!

37:34.190 --> 37:36.310
- Amazing.
- Oh, she's great, isn't she?

37:36.330 --> 37:37.810
- Yeah.
- Shh.

37:38.850 --> 37:40.910
No, that is my daughter!

37:42.370 --> 37:45.560
And no word of any of
it to miss annabelle.

37:45.580 --> 37:47.010
- Hey!
- Hey!

37:47.040 --> 37:48.190
That was awesome.

37:48.220 --> 37:50.740
Honey, you were fantastic! Oh, my gosh.

37:50.760 --> 37:53.410
You can be on broadway. I swear.

37:53.430 --> 37:55.550
Honey, and that dress. We gotta
get a picture of you in that dress.

37:55.570 --> 37:57.490
Yeah, you were beautiful. I don't
know where you get the talent from.

37:57.510 --> 37:59.600
- Not from him.
- Not from me.

37:59.620 --> 38:02.910
I tell you, honey, that scene where
you tell the kid, the guy, the thing?

38:02.940 --> 38:04.830
Oh, my god.

38:04.850 --> 38:06.230
We got you these.

38:06.260 --> 38:09.210
Did you call heather
mcnamara's mother fat?

38:09.230 --> 38:11.800
Did you?It's all over school, you know.

38:11.820 --> 38:13.810
Heather's mother said
you were drunk last night.

38:13.830 --> 38:15.540
And you called someone else a bitch,

38:15.560 --> 38:17.920
and you were falling down, and
everyone's talking about it.

38:17.940 --> 38:20.390
- You've ruined everything!
- Come over here.

38:21.540 --> 38:24.130
First of all, there was no falling down.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.010
She did not fall down.

38:26.620 --> 38:31.580
Honey, it was a grown-up situation
that I didn't handle well.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.420
Ok?But those women were
very, very mean to me.

38:34.450 --> 38:36.790
That's right.And they made
me feel very bad about myself.

38:36.820 --> 38:39.390
Maybe you are bad! Did
you ever think of that?

38:39.410 --> 38:41.560
Hey! Hey.

38:41.590 --> 38:43.450
Now listen.

38:43.450 --> 38:45.640
Ok, you don't understand,
because you're not an adult.

38:45.670 --> 38:48.840
And it was a bunch of adults
in a situation where they were--

38:48.870 --> 38:51.420
they--that
woman is fat!

38:51.450 --> 38:53.890
You can't just show up
here and wreck it for me.

38:53.910 --> 38:55.260
Ok, I like it here.

38:55.290 --> 38:57.450
It's safe, and there's no surprises.

38:57.470 --> 38:59.900
And people don't show up
pretending to be all happy

38:59.930 --> 39:04.060
and then turn out to be the same
awful people they always were.

39:05.330 --> 39:08.730
I belong here. You don'T.

39:09.640 --> 39:13.470
- Honey, I am so
sorry-- - Good-bye, mom.

39:13.490 --> 39:15.940
- No, you don't understand--
- I said good-bye!

39:15.970 --> 39:17.460
Hey!

39:25.580 --> 39:28.100
Maybe I should have worn the pants.

39:29.080 --> 39:32.640
She's not going to talk to us.Come on.

39:50.820 --> 39:53.230
I was the one who said it.

39:53.250 --> 39:57.880
I said that everything we do
this weekend reflects on katie.

39:58.790 --> 40:01.290
I thought it'd be you.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.540
It was me.

40:05.570 --> 40:08.920
Yeah, give her a couple of
weeks, she'll be fine, you know?

40:10.360 --> 40:13.420
Maybe I am a bad person.

40:14.080 --> 40:16.320
Honey...

40:16.340 --> 40:18.420
you know that's not true.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.620
I don'T.

40:20.640 --> 40:23.640
I really don'T.

40:30.750 --> 40:33.180
What do we do now?

40:34.040 --> 40:36.250
Go back to the loft?

40:38.230 --> 40:40.500
That's not funny.

40:40.540 --> 40:43.390
It's kind of funny.
