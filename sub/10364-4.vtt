Well, you tell me.

17:00.160 --> 17:03.600
But what are you doing in my kitchen?

17:03.680 --> 17:06.640
Three weeks ago, I was released,
and I decided to become clean

17:06.720 --> 17:10.200
because that was the only way
to get my writing job back.

17:10.280 --> 17:12.160
But do you know what happened?

17:13.320 --> 17:14.480
Not really.

17:14.560 --> 17:18.040
The minute I quit,
I couldn't write a fucking single word.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.480
I was tormented by guilt.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.200
Smoking the glass pipe
makes you hurt a lot of people.

17:22.280 --> 17:27.720
And the person I thought the most
was you, my friend. Yeah.

17:27.800 --> 17:31.960
Yeah, I couldn't forgive myself
for all the trouble that I caused you.

17:32.040 --> 17:35.440
But sometimes bad is the seed of good.

17:35.520 --> 17:38.040
And I had a flash of insight, you know.

17:38.120 --> 17:41.160
What if I offended you for a reason?

17:41.240 --> 17:44.960
So I immediately started
writing you into my telenovela.

17:45.040 --> 17:48.200
And three hours later,
bam, I had a script!

17:49.320 --> 17:51.840
You see where are we going with this?

17:53.760 --> 17:56.560
- No.
- [Gabriel] Okay.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.120
Let me try again.
I'm offering you an acting job.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.040
The pay is insane.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.360
You're going to be a huge celebrity.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.880
And girls will love you.

18:06.960 --> 18:08.320
The girls will love me?

18:08.400 --> 18:10.200
Yeah, for sure.

18:10.280 --> 18:13.040
- Even the favela girls?
- Why?

18:14.640 --> 18:16.960
Well, because I'm...

18:17.040 --> 18:20.240
I'm... I'm really, really in love
with one of them.

18:21.840 --> 18:25.520
I see. Yeah, especially the favela girls.

18:28.680 --> 18:33.720
- [Stupidity singing "King Midas"]
- [crowd whistles and cheers]

19:07.120 --> 19:09.040
What's going on?

19:09.120 --> 19:12.680
[in Norwegian] We're celebrating that
Roar was cast in an international TV show.

19:14.280 --> 19:17.040
- [in English] Really?
- You didn't know?

19:22.040 --> 19:23.560
[both chuckle]

19:23.640 --> 19:24.640
I'll wear this one.

19:25.680 --> 19:29.000
Oh, look who's here!
The new Edward G. Robinson!

19:29.080 --> 19:31.640
Is this the guy who's crazy enough
to think you can act?

19:31.720 --> 19:34.000
Yeah, that's me. Gabriel.

19:34.080 --> 19:37.360
Johnny. You know he's a cab driver, right?

19:37.440 --> 19:39.520
Yeah. Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know.

19:39.600 --> 19:44.000
But everybody's acting these days,
like musicians, comedians, cab drivers.

19:44.080 --> 19:46.360
Yeah, it's all about attitude.

19:46.440 --> 19:48.880
[in Norwegian] We're going
to Rio tomorrow. It will be awesome!

19:48.960 --> 19:49.960
[Roar sighs]

19:51.600 --> 19:54.360
- Can you excuse us for just a minute?
- Yeah. Sure.

19:56.840 --> 19:58.760
Going back to Brazil, huh?

19:58.840 --> 20:02.280
You know how hard it was for me
and your brother to get you out of there?

20:02.360 --> 20:03.680
Yeah, I know, I know.

20:03.760 --> 20:06.720
And I know I owe you my life
for doing what you did.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.360
But I really need this.

20:08.440 --> 20:11.600
[in Norwegian]
This is my last chance to see Alex.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.520
[in English] Oh, yeah, Alex.

20:14.600 --> 20:19.840
[in Norwegian] No worries. Gabriel says
no policeman will touch a telenovela star.

20:19.920 --> 20:21.720
[in English] So it's no problem.

20:23.560 --> 20:25.560
[Roar whoops]

20:25.640 --> 20:27.240
[Roar] Let's party!

20:27.320 --> 20:29.600
[sighs]

20:36.320 --> 20:40.120
[in Nepalese] What are your thoughts
on cloudberry yogurt and cranberry juice?

20:40.200 --> 20:41.600
Think that would be good?

20:41.680 --> 20:45.560
Shut your pie hole and focus on pulling.
How much further?

20:45.640 --> 20:47.120
Only 300 more meters, brother.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.960
[in English]
You need a little help with that?

20:55.320 --> 20:56.360
Yeah. Sure.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.080
[Arne grunts]

21:06.840 --> 21:11.040
Mr. Olafsen's not exactly overpaying you.
Am I right?

21:11.120 --> 21:12.640
Amen to that.

21:13.680 --> 21:18.440
Yeah, well... I got some issues
with the cheap fuck myself.

21:19.480 --> 21:21.920
I could use
some background information on him.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.800
You think you can help me with that?

21:26.160 --> 21:30.480
If so, you will find
I'm a much more generous man.

21:31.480 --> 21:33.160
Can you define "generous"?

21:42.240 --> 21:44.000
Does it have a turbo accelerator?

21:44.080 --> 21:45.960
That could be arranged.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.520
[Lars pants]

22:00.040 --> 22:01.120
Hello there!

22:01.200 --> 22:04.120
- You got a minute?
- [Lars] No. I've got two more laps to go.

22:05.120 --> 22:06.760
I'll leave you to it.

22:09.320 --> 22:13.240
Oh, by the way, Dawashiri says hello.

22:14.720 --> 22:16.920
Dawa... Dawashiri?

22:17.920 --> 22:19.440
Am I mispronouncing it?

22:19.520 --> 22:23.600
You know, your old friend
that guided you up Everest?

22:31.800 --> 22:33.600
What about him?

22:33.680 --> 22:37.160
We've been e-mailing each other lately

22:37.240 --> 22:40.480
and, you know, it's funny.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.120
Funny? What...? What's funny?

22:44.440 --> 22:45.960
According to him...

22:47.000 --> 22:50.760
...you never quite actually got
to the top, Lars.

22:53.040 --> 22:56.040
The old man gave
quite a vivid description.

22:56.120 --> 23:00.600
Him carrying you down the mountain.
You crying like a little girl.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.320
Cry? You...

23:02.400 --> 23:05.840
This is fucking bullshit
and you should know that!

23:08.960 --> 23:11.920
Next time you want to buy somebody off
to keep 'em quiet,

23:12.000 --> 23:15.120
I suggest you don't use
Tibetan wage rates.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.080
Nice photoshopping.

23:20.840 --> 23:22.440
Listen, Johnny.

23:22.520 --> 23:25.320
I was this close to the summit. I was...

23:25.400 --> 23:28.880
Thirty meters below,
I got altitude sickness

23:28.960 --> 23:35.640
and... the picture on the book
shows the truth of how it feels inside.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.320
I understand.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.720
- My guy jumps on Tuesday.
- Okay.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.720
[door opens]

23:57.720 --> 23:58.960
Is that you, Jan?

23:59.040 --> 24:01.000
[in Norwegian] Belinda let me in.

24:01.080 --> 24:02.280
[Jan chuckles]

24:02.360 --> 24:05.040
[in English] I knew
the Norwegian penal system was relaxed,

24:05.120 --> 24:07.200
but not this relaxed.

24:07.280 --> 24:10.360
I'm not in the penal system anymore.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.760
You want to explain that?

24:15.840 --> 24:19.360
Well, you know, they got a new suspect.

24:21.800 --> 24:26.920
You framed Dag while he's in a coma,
you son of a bitch.

24:27.000 --> 24:30.840
You have no idea how hard it was there.
On the inside.

24:30.920 --> 24:35.120
Johnny, I've got absolutely
no friends in there.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.680
How's that different
from the rest of your life?

24:42.040 --> 24:44.000
[in Norwegian]
Always good for a laugh.

24:44.080 --> 24:47.080
I actually expected you to be happier,

24:47.160 --> 24:51.080
now that I've tied up all the loose ends.

24:52.400 --> 24:53.600
[in English] This ain't right.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.120
[in Norwegian] It's a gray area,
ethically speaking, I admit.

24:58.200 --> 25:00.160
[in English] If it's something I can do,

25:00.240 --> 25:03.440
anything, you know,
to maybe help out here.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.880
Like what?

25:05.960 --> 25:11.920
It was quite a lot of money I managed
to put away before I left for Iraq.

25:12.000 --> 25:16.480
[in Norwegian]
Maybe I could give a contribution

25:16.560 --> 25:19.920
to make sure Dag's final time
at the hospital is dignified.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.760
[in English]
And where is this money?

25:25.040 --> 25:27.520
[Jan in Norwegian] I'm excited
to see my cabin again.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.880
[Jan chuckles]

25:32.720 --> 25:34.680
[in English]
No, no. You don't need to park here.

25:34.760 --> 25:36.640
It's a parking space by the cabin.

25:39.800 --> 25:43.040
Who drives an Audi S8 out here
in the middle of the fucking woods?

25:44.440 --> 25:46.400
[in Norwegian]
It's the guy from the neighboring cabin.

25:57.920 --> 26:00.280
Well, well. Back again, Johnny.

26:00.360 --> 26:05.520
Maybe you'd like to lie down or something?

26:05.600 --> 26:07.160
Maybe you want to take a...

26:07.240 --> 26:10.080
I buried the money,
so I guess it'll take a minute to...

26:16.600 --> 26:18.480
[in English] Really?

26:22.360 --> 26:24.240
THE DOOR IS OPEN

26:42.560 --> 26:46.080
[Johnny] Jackson, Bradley...
Seems like 1,000 years ago .

26:47.600 --> 26:50.160
What happened to the Knicks this year?

26:50.240 --> 26:52.600
[Jan] Yeah, yeah. What about them?

26:52.680 --> 26:56.960
[Johnny through speakers]  Frazier,
Earl the Pearl, Reed, Jackson, Bradley...

26:57.040 --> 26:58.520

What the hell is that smell?

27:19.480 --> 27:21.120
I, my friend...

27:22.560 --> 27:25.120
...am the last guy you want to fuck with.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.520
[director] Okay. We are rolling.

27:42.600 --> 27:44.200
Stand by...

27:45.200 --> 27:46.400
...and action!

27:46.480 --> 27:48.560
[harpsichord music playing]

27:50.920 --> 27:54.640
[in Brazilan Portuguese] Have I ever
told you your green eyes light up my life?

27:56.600 --> 28:00.480
Oh, my dear, you don't have to be afraid.
It is all over.

28:00.560 --> 28:02.880
I hope you're right.

28:02.960 --> 28:05.880
I will give you the world
and everything that comes with it!

28:07.240 --> 28:11.160
I have a surprise for you.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.200
[giggles]

28:25.800 --> 28:29.400
My love for you is deeper
than the Mariana Trench.

28:29.480 --> 28:32.880
As long as you're by my side,
the sun will never go down.

28:45.040 --> 28:48.520
Oh, Mario! This is too good to be true!

28:48.600 --> 28:53.040
Yes, it is indeed too good to be true.

28:53.120 --> 28:54.960
[Mario] Who's he?

28:55.040 --> 28:58.440
- You look like...
- That's right.

28:58.520 --> 29:01.760
I'm Kurt Schwitter Rossi.

29:02.760 --> 29:06.800
[chuckles] The son of Rossi, Hector Rossi.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.120
You're my stepmother,

29:10.200 --> 29:16.080
and you're the son of a bitch
who killed my father.

29:16.160 --> 29:18.920
Enjoy the poison.

29:19.000 --> 29:20.760
[chuckles]

29:20.840 --> 29:22.920
Oh, no! The wine.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.720
My dear, Mario.

29:25.800 --> 29:26.880
[Kurt laughs evilly]

29:26.960 --> 29:28.400
Mario, no!

29:28.480 --> 29:32.240
My love! No! Mario!

29:32.320 --> 29:33.320
[co-director in English] Cut!

29:34.320 --> 29:36.240
- Yes!
- Fantastic work, guys!

29:36.320 --> 29:39.480
Yes! You are my man, you know!

29:39.560 --> 29:42.840
You were fucking great, man! Yeah!

29:42.920 --> 29:44.840
[Roar] Thanks, man. That was amazing!

29:44.920 --> 29:47.040
Maybe I should do a bit more
with the mask.

29:47.120 --> 29:50.120
No, are you kidding me?
No, it was fantastic. It was magic.

29:50.200 --> 29:54.240
It was real, you know.
You almost made me cry. Yeah.

29:54.320 --> 29:55.600
Well, it's the writing.

29:55.680 --> 29:58.760
Because you write so fucking good,
I almost don't have to act.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.040
No, no, no. It was you. Listen...

30:02.040 --> 30:03.440
We are wrapping early today,

30:03.520 --> 30:07.000
so me and the guys,
we are going to a bar to have some fun.

30:07.080 --> 30:11.440
Okay. I'm having problems with this girl,
so I have to deal with that.

30:11.520 --> 30:14.760
- But maybe later.
- Yeah. Yeah, take your time.

30:14.840 --> 30:19.000
Don't forget tomorrow is the scene
with your father's ghost, you know?

30:19.080 --> 30:21.400
And that shit's going to be epic, right?

30:21.480 --> 30:23.840
Right as rain! Yeah!

30:23.920 --> 30:26.000
- Oh, my God! I love you, man!
- Whatever.

30:26.080 --> 30:28.920
Real nice working with you.
It was perfect.

30:29.000 --> 30:31.400
You're awesome.
You're so beautiful, yeah.

30:31.480 --> 30:32.920
Thank you!

[Dimmu Borgir's "Mourning Palace" playing]

31:03.160 --> 31:04.160
[cracking]

31:04.240 --> 31:08.280
[in Brazilian Portuguese] No hitting.
I said, no hitting!

31:09.600 --> 31:12.280
Don't hit that motherfucker!

31:17.280 --> 31:19.360
Let's go now. That's enough.

Could you please come out?

I know you're in there!
I saw the curtains move!

31:58.880 --> 32:01.560
God damn it, Alex!
I love you so much!

[in Brazilan Portuguese] Shut up!
I'm trying to watch my soap opera.

Is he stupid or what?

Thank you for waking my chickens.

- Take this.

[announcer in Norwegian]
The 20th anniversary

32:45.360 --> 32:48.960
of the best winter Olympic games ever
is about to start.

32:49.960 --> 32:54.040
We do apologize to our complainers
at the waffle stands,

32:54.120 --> 32:58.040
as there are no gluten-free alternatives.

33:00.200 --> 33:03.600
- [in English] Everything cool?
- Yeah, it's going to be packed.

33:03.680 --> 33:08.560

and Torgeir wasn't there.

Nothing to worry about.

33:11.480 --> 33:12.480
[Lars] Okay.

33:17.240 --> 33:20.320
Check on Torgeir. I'll look like a schmuck
if he fucks this up.

33:23.240 --> 33:25.160
[Arne in Norwegian] Torgeir,
hold your stomach in.

33:25.240 --> 33:28.800
- I am. Ouch!
- [Birgitte] It's way too tight.

33:28.880 --> 33:30.840
You're not trying hard enough.

33:30.920 --> 33:33.560
[Torgeir yelps] That hurts! Stop it!

33:34.920 --> 33:36.680
[Roy] What the hell is going on here?

33:36.760 --> 33:38.560
I told you not to wash it at 30 degrees.

33:38.640 --> 33:39.920
They're waiting for you.

33:40.000 --> 33:44.000
I washed it by hand! It's not my fault
you've gained weight around your hips.

33:44.080 --> 33:47.400
Gained weight?
I'm fucking skin and bones over here!

33:47.480 --> 33:50.320
Arne has a point.
You've gotten curvier lately.

33:51.760 --> 33:52.880
[all shout]

33:52.960 --> 33:54.600
[Birgitte] Guys!

33:54.680 --> 33:57.640
You two, shut up! You, sit down!

34:00.120 --> 34:03.640
Torgeir needs peace and quiet
to get into competition mode.

34:03.720 --> 34:04.720
Yes.

34:05.960 --> 34:08.560
- Okay.
- All right, leave.

34:08.640 --> 34:10.600
- Hurry up!
- I said, leave!

34:10.680 --> 34:12.080
I worked all night for you.

34:19.720 --> 34:22.560
[in English] Oh, Roarito! Finally!

34:22.640 --> 34:24.520
Okay, take a seat, man.

34:26.160 --> 34:27.360
You don't look too good.

34:28.440 --> 34:31.920
Maybe it's because
I've just been drenched in chicken shit.

34:32.000 --> 34:33.160
Maybe that's why.

34:33.240 --> 34:35.680
Oh, I thought it was just body odor.

34:36.960 --> 34:39.360
But you'll be fine.
I'll get some booze for you.

34:39.440 --> 34:42.760
[in Brazilian Portuguese] Hey, buddy,
can you bring a drink for my friend?

34:42.840 --> 34:46.600
I'm sorry. Your friend stinks.
You have to leave.

34:48.800 --> 34:50.120
Don't you know who he is?

34:50.200 --> 34:54.040
Yes, and he still smells. Now leave.

34:55.040 --> 34:56.520
[in English] Yeah, we have to go.

34:56.600 --> 34:59.480
They have a strict code
about personal hygiene, you know.

35:02.720 --> 35:04.400
[in Brazilian Portuguese]
Thanks. Bye.

35:09.160 --> 35:10.840
[Roar in English]
It's just my luck, man.

35:10.920 --> 35:13.240
I'm finally a star and I smell like shit.

35:13.320 --> 35:14.880
[Blondie in Brazilian Portuguese] Hey.

35:16.120 --> 35:18.160
Aren't you the guys from  The Half-Sister?

35:19.400 --> 35:21.440
Right. He's the actor. I'm the writer.

35:21.520 --> 35:24.800
I'm going to an afterparty nearby.
Want to come?

35:27.120 --> 35:29.680
[in English] Afterparty? Nearby.

35:29.760 --> 35:30.800
- Okay.
- Okay.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.720
Let's go.

35:32.800 --> 35:34.240
[Gabriel] Here we go.

35:43.440 --> 35:47.040
[announcer in Norwegian]  It looks like
we're having some technical problems.

35:47.120 --> 35:51.040
We kindly ask you all
to have some patience.

35:51.120 --> 35:54.640
[Birgitte] Great. How did you do it?

35:55.640 --> 36:01.760
I had to take off everything
that was underneath.

36:01.840 --> 36:04.840
The friction is killing me.

36:08.200 --> 36:11.000
- [Arne] What's the time?
- [Roy] Don't know.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.960
[Arne] Well, there he is.

36:14.040 --> 36:16.080
[in English] What's going on?
He was supposed to jump ten minutes ago.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.160
[in Norwegian]
He complained about his suit,

36:18.240 --> 36:20.280
but the problem is probably in his head.

36:20.360 --> 36:23.240
[in English] Olafsen is on the phone
calling the other jumper!

36:32.120 --> 36:33.560
[in Norwegian] Take a sip.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.440
Torgeir...

36:41.960 --> 36:46.960
...this is what you have dreamt of
all your life.

36:47.040 --> 36:50.080
- I guess so.
- [Birgitte] I think it's kind of cool.

36:51.560 --> 36:54.400
Yeah, and kind of sexy as well.

36:54.480 --> 36:55.480
Yeah?

36:55.560 --> 36:57.840
[Birgitte] Is there
anything I can do for you?

37:01.800 --> 37:03.320
Anything.

37:05.720 --> 37:06.960
Anything?

37:08.280 --> 37:09.920
[in English] Fuck it! I'm going in.

37:13.320 --> 37:16.600
[Torgeir groans]

37:19.280 --> 37:21.280
Second thought,

37:21.360 --> 37:27.040
you really should respect the, uh,
athlete's preparation time.

37:27.120 --> 37:30.560
Are they doing
those motivational exercises?

37:30.640 --> 37:32.600
Yes, they are.

37:32.680 --> 37:36.880
Very motivational exercises.

37:38.000 --> 37:40.320
[Torgeir screams]

37:49.120 --> 37:51.120
[crowd cheering]

38:05.160 --> 38:07.400
[breathing anxiously]

38:10.600 --> 38:12.400
[Torgeir mutters softly]

38:15.520 --> 38:17.280
What's he waiting for?

38:22.240 --> 38:24.000
[Lars] The wind is perfect. He should...

38:25.760 --> 38:28.160
Take it easy. He knows what he's doing.

38:28.680 --> 38:32.160
[heart pounding]

38:35.640 --> 38:39.440
If he doesn't jump now,
I'll have to go up there and jump myself.

38:39.520 --> 38:41.560
Come on, Torgeir.

38:52.400 --> 38:55.680
[Torgeir in Norwegian]  My coach used to
say that there are three kinds of jumps.

38:55.760 --> 38:58.280
The failed ones
where you think about the outcome.

38:58.360 --> 38:59.920
- He's going.
- He's going now.

39:01.200 --> 39:04.480
[Torgeir]  The good ones
where you think about the task at hand.

39:12.160 --> 39:15.240
And the fantastic ones
where you don't think of a damn thing.

39:15.320 --> 39:18.440
Where God grabs you by the neck
and carries you through the air.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.640
I never understood
what he meant by that last one.

39:25.720 --> 39:26.920
Not until today.

39:27.000 --> 39:31.320
[Southside Johnny & The Ashbury Jukes'
"Ride the Night Away" playing]

39:34.600 --> 39:36.000
[in English] Did you see that jump?

39:39.800 --> 39:41.800
[whoops]

39:47.680 --> 39:49.400
[Johnny] What did I tell you?

39:57.960 --> 39:59.160
[Torgeir roars]

39:59.240 --> 40:01.240
[all cheer]

40:09.480 --> 40:10.560
[Torgeir] Thank you.

40:13.320 --> 40:15.320
[Birgitte screams]

40:22.680 --> 40:25.960
[both scream]

40:26.040 --> 40:29.000
[Torgeir in English]
I'm a winner! I'm a winner!

40:31.680 --> 40:33.480
[Johnny] You did it, kid.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.560
[chuckles]

40:35.640 --> 40:37.600
Oh, look at this.

40:38.600 --> 40:39.920
Yo!

40:41.560 --> 40:42.760
Was I right or was I right?

40:43.760 --> 40:45.200
Well, yeah.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.400
So are you coming to the party or what?

40:48.480 --> 40:51.880
Maybe later.
I need some time gathering my thoughts.

40:51.960 --> 40:57.320
If you don't feel like a success,
then you got to ask yourself,

40:57.400 --> 40:59.320
did I have any success at all?

40:59.400 --> 41:01.160
We'll keep that in mind...

41:02.160 --> 41:03.760
...when we're getting laid.

41:04.840 --> 41:07.000
Come on. Fuck that party pooper.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.040
[Roar sighs]

41:21.120 --> 41:24.840
I thought you said this afterparty
was going to be nearby.

41:24.920 --> 41:27.400
We're almost there.

41:34.880 --> 41:36.920
[in Brazilian Portuguese]
We're not stupid tourists you can rob.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.760
I know the people running these streets.

41:38.840 --> 41:41.160
Shut up, crackhead!

41:41.240 --> 41:43.200
What the fuck did you just call me?

41:45.560 --> 41:46.840
[cracking]

41:46.920 --> 41:52.520
[in English] If this has anything to do
with crack, I have nothing to do with it.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.400
But we are here for you, Roar.

41:56.200 --> 41:57.680
Christiane.

41:58.800 --> 42:02.160
It was my million
that you and Oscarito lost to the cops.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.480
But... Okay. But...

42:04.560 --> 42:05.720
[Christiane whistles]

[Alex cries out]

43:01.840 --> 43:03.240
[Lars clears throat]

[Lakhpa in Nepalese ] I can't believe
we still work for this jerk.

43:26.680 --> 43:28.880
[Tensing] Don't forget the dream, brother.

43:28.960 --> 43:32.160
[Lakhpa] Dreams are for people like him.

43:32.240 --> 43:33.720
Not for people like us.
