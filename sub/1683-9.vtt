00:01.935 --> 00:03.635
Previously on sleepy hollow...
Irving:
<i>Jennifer mills,</i>

00:03.637 --> 00:05.004
You've helped
your sister before.

00:05.006 --> 00:06.271
Abbie wants me
to bring you into this,

00:06.273 --> 00:07.473
<i>Says you'll be valuable.</i>

00:07.475 --> 00:09.341
<i>But I need to know-- are you n</i>

00:09.343 --> 00:12.044
Or out?
In.

00:12.046 --> 00:13.979
You fell in love,
you get married,

00:13.981 --> 00:15.981
But the whole time
you have no idea

00:15.983 --> 00:18.617
That your wife is a witch.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.652
Correct.
How could you not know?

00:20.654 --> 00:21.854
She was protecting me.

00:21.856 --> 00:23.222
<i>We are part of an ancient ordr</i>

00:23.224 --> 00:24.623
Sworn to fight the darkness

00:24.625 --> 00:26.191
That hides in sleepy hollow.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.961
We're dealing with forces
so beyond our control.

00:28.963 --> 00:30.863
Beyond beyond.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.065
(whispering, snarling)
jenny!

00:33.067 --> 00:33.966
(weapon cocks)

00:33.968 --> 00:35.200
That's the key,
lieutenant.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.902
Now, more than ever,

00:36.904 --> 00:39.171
We need katrina.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.340
What is it
you're afraid to say?

00:41.342 --> 00:43.475
I believe I know why I am here.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.978
Why?
Ichabod!

00:48.048 --> 00:49.114
(caws)

00:51.017 --> 00:53.752
I'm pulling up to it right now.

00:53.754 --> 00:55.821
Yes, I'll send you pictures.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.990
<i>I can't believe it used</i>
<i>to belong to my family.</i>

00:57.992 --> 01:01.060
<i>I know. I'm just so curious.</i>

01:01.062 --> 01:04.430
<i>I want to learn everything</i>
<i>I can about this place.</i>

01:04.432 --> 01:07.066
<i>It's one of the oldest homes</i>
<i>in the area.</i>

01:07.068 --> 01:08.333
<i>It took me five years</i>

01:08.335 --> 01:10.869
To secure the title.

01:10.871 --> 01:12.805
(gasps)

01:14.674 --> 01:18.877
<i>Oh, I'd like to restore it</i>
<i>to its original grandeur.</i>

01:18.879 --> 01:21.747
We have a lot
of work to do.

01:22.715 --> 01:24.416
I love it.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.051
Really?

01:26.053 --> 01:28.554
It's history, sam--
my family's history,

01:28.556 --> 01:30.522
To be exact--

01:30.524 --> 01:33.859
So show some respect.

01:33.861 --> 01:36.695
Things happened here
that need to be remembered.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.363
Looks haunted.

01:39.866 --> 01:42.434
For a bodyguard,
you are a very fearful man.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.938
Lena. Lena!

01:45.940 --> 01:46.905
Until we know
it's structurally safe

01:46.907 --> 01:48.240
In there,
you are not go...

01:48.242 --> 01:51.243
(wings fluttering)

01:51.245 --> 01:52.911
(exhales)

01:52.913 --> 01:54.980
It's amazing.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.651
Lena: Wow, it's bigger
than I thought it'd be.

01:59.653 --> 02:00.786
(crow caws)

02:06.059 --> 02:08.393
We should restore
all of this.

02:19.005 --> 02:20.806
(branches and tendrils
crackling softly)

02:21.508 --> 02:23.609
Stubborn little brutes.

02:23.611 --> 02:26.011
Sam! We should've
brought the hedge clippers!

02:26.013 --> 02:27.112
The place is completely...

02:27.114 --> 02:28.814
(gasps)

02:31.518 --> 02:33.252
(crow cawing)

02:35.588 --> 02:37.256
(panting)

02:39.993 --> 02:42.828
(screaming)

02:42.830 --> 02:44.163
Crane:
<i>I'm merely noting</i>

02:44.165 --> 02:47.166
The eradication of a
thrice-daily tradition,

02:47.168 --> 02:48.800
Wherein each meal
is treated

02:48.802 --> 02:50.502
With the proper
allowance of time.

02:50.504 --> 02:54.139
Not that the "drive-through"
wasn't impressive.

02:54.141 --> 02:56.175
And despite this
establishment's nomenclature,

02:56.177 --> 02:58.710
This resembles no scottish
meal I've ever eaten.

02:58.712 --> 03:01.280
These are from the austrian
netherlands, for one thing.

03:01.282 --> 03:03.282
And dreadfully prepared.

03:03.284 --> 03:05.817
This is probably as much of
a thanksgiving as we're getting.

03:05.819 --> 03:07.486
What about your sister?

03:07.488 --> 03:09.454
This is "family time."

03:09.456 --> 03:11.456
I don't think my having
conservatorship over her

03:11.458 --> 03:13.559
Since her release from
the nuthouse necessarily leads

03:13.561 --> 03:15.661
To "pass the cranberry sauce."

03:15.663 --> 03:17.563
The what?

03:17.565 --> 03:19.998
Turkey, cranberry sauce,
pumpkin pie.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.901
You know, all the stuff
the pilgrims ate.

03:22.903 --> 03:26.205
The pilgrims didn't have
any sugar to make a sauce,

03:26.207 --> 03:27.873
Let alone a pie.

03:27.875 --> 03:28.907
And venison,

03:28.909 --> 03:30.576
Not turkey, was served.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.044
It would've been
a miracle

03:32.046 --> 03:33.045
For a single
half-starved

03:33.047 --> 03:35.147
Pheasant to trot past

03:35.149 --> 03:36.081
During such a
harsh winter...
Hold up.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.117
Pheasants?

03:40.220 --> 03:43.055
All this talk of holidays,

03:43.057 --> 03:46.024
Turkeys, family time...

03:46.026 --> 03:47.993
Irks me.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.928
Because of katrina.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.930
If I can't be with my wife

03:51.932 --> 03:54.032
During a time of thanks
and celebration,

03:54.034 --> 03:56.068
Why must there be
so many constant reminders

03:56.070 --> 03:59.037
Of the inescapable fact
that I...

03:59.039 --> 04:01.139
You're alone.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.711
I mean no disrespect.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.914
Your company holds
the greatest value to me.

04:08.916 --> 04:11.350
Crane...

04:11.352 --> 04:14.253
You have a right to be angry.

04:14.255 --> 04:18.123
You've lost more than
anyone ever should.

04:18.125 --> 04:20.926
Besides, what are holidays for
if not airing our grievances?

04:20.928 --> 04:22.361
(chuckles)

04:24.964 --> 04:27.299
After our nuptials,

04:27.301 --> 04:32.104
I had such hope for the life
katrina and I were to share.

04:32.106 --> 04:35.274
It's been a crazy few weeks.

04:35.276 --> 04:38.110
You'll feel better
after a night off.

04:38.112 --> 04:40.445
Irving:
Crane, mills--

04:40.447 --> 04:41.747
Got something for you.

04:41.749 --> 04:44.750
Kindly inform me
when that night arrives.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.452
So much for
the proper allowance of time.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.754
Irving:
Lena gilbert--

04:48.756 --> 04:50.956
Philanthropist,
author, socialite.

04:50.958 --> 04:53.125
Miss gilbert's lineage
goes back generations,

04:53.127 --> 04:54.960
To the founding fathers.

04:54.962 --> 04:56.895
She looks great
in fancy dresses, too.

04:56.897 --> 04:57.929
Why is she our concern?

04:57.931 --> 04:59.264
That was two days ago.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.566
No one has seen her since.

05:01.568 --> 05:03.568
Normally, not a problem,
but she didn't show up

05:03.570 --> 05:05.570
At a fund raiser in dc
last night.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.005
About an hour ago,
the senate majority leader

05:07.007 --> 05:10.075
Contacted me personally
to check on her whereabouts.

05:10.077 --> 05:12.577
Apparently we're not supposed
to lose track of billionaires.

05:12.579 --> 05:15.113
Sorry-- I'm not mistaken--
you did just say she is a...

05:15.115 --> 05:16.915
Billionaire, correct?

05:16.917 --> 05:18.083
Yes.

05:19.185 --> 05:22.354
Meaning she has a
billion... Dollars?

05:22.356 --> 05:24.323
That's the gross national income

05:24.325 --> 05:27.626
Of all 13 colonies,
in my lifetime.

05:27.628 --> 05:29.761
Sounds like a rich lady
took a wrong turn

05:29.763 --> 05:31.330
On the way
to her country home.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.965
Any of the other units
can handle it.

05:33.967 --> 05:36.335
A member of her staff
faxed this over-- copy of a note

05:36.337 --> 05:38.837
They found in lena's
handwriting on her desk.

05:38.839 --> 05:40.505
That's your wife's name,
isn't it?

05:44.677 --> 05:46.778
I thought you might
be interested.

05:46.780 --> 05:49.781
Okay, yeah, that's
an interesting coincidence,

05:49.783 --> 05:52.017
But if she's supposed to be
in dc, how do we even know

05:52.019 --> 05:53.618
That she is still in the area?

05:53.620 --> 05:55.821
Her assistant tracked the gps
on her car.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.022
The last ping was here
in sleepy hollow.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.557
After that...

05:58.559 --> 06:00.225
Fell off the map, disappeared.

06:02.128 --> 06:04.596
Keep me posted.

06:08.735 --> 06:11.303
It could be
a different katrina.

06:11.305 --> 06:13.405
It's not just katrina.

06:13.407 --> 06:16.241
"katrina c.,"
as in "katrina crane."

06:16.243 --> 06:18.043
One initial does not
a connection make.

06:18.045 --> 06:20.078
Oh, you've surely come
to realize by now, lieutenant,

06:20.080 --> 06:21.346
That when the two
of us are involved,

06:21.348 --> 06:24.049
Rarely is a coincidence
a coincidence.

06:24.051 --> 06:27.319
The captain said
miss gilbert's lineage

06:27.321 --> 06:30.021
Dates back
to the founding fathers.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.424
Could your...
Wondrous internet

06:32.426 --> 06:35.694
Perform a search
on miss gilbert's ancestry?

06:35.696 --> 06:37.195
What are we looking for?

06:37.197 --> 06:40.098
Ties to landowners

06:40.100 --> 06:42.401
Within the confines of
the sleepy hollow area.
All right.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.403
Dating back to my era.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.705
Gilbert.

06:46.707 --> 06:49.441
All right, father's side,

06:49.443 --> 06:52.911
Ownership of new world steel,
dune chemicals...

06:52.913 --> 06:55.013
Mother's side, maiden name...

06:55.015 --> 06:56.448
Fredericks.

06:56.450 --> 07:00.118
Owned mining interests,
invested in railroads.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.487
Seemed like they owned half the
eastern seaboard at one time.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.090
Of course.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.293
Fredericks manor.

07:08.295 --> 07:11.530
Named for lachlan fredericks,

07:11.532 --> 07:13.732
Influential landowner
and charter member

07:13.734 --> 07:15.534
Of the continental congress.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.470
Needless to say, a keen
supporter of the war effort.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.272
And, I assume,
a friend of yours.

07:20.274 --> 07:24.075
I know where
miss gilbert went.

07:24.077 --> 07:26.111
Abbie:
<i>I pulled the land title</i>

07:26.113 --> 07:28.079
<i>And deed from city hall.</i>

07:28.081 --> 07:29.915
<i>This place has had</i>
<i>a few different owners,</i>

07:29.917 --> 07:30.949
<i>But no one's actually</i>
<i>lived here</i>

07:30.951 --> 07:32.317
<i>For more than a few weeks</i>

07:32.319 --> 07:34.119
<i>Since lachlan fredericks.</i>

07:34.121 --> 07:36.655
(crow caws)

07:45.965 --> 07:47.833
It's empty.

07:47.835 --> 07:49.000
Inside, maybe?

07:49.002 --> 07:50.969
It's not possible.

07:50.971 --> 07:52.971
Fredericks manor-- this is
where you wanted to go, right?

07:52.973 --> 07:54.506
It is indeed.

07:54.508 --> 07:56.975
But it hardly resembles
the residence

07:56.977 --> 07:59.778
Katrina and I visited
during the war.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.180
(carriage rattling)

08:05.017 --> 08:08.820
<i>Katrina had been requesting</i>
<i>to visit the estate for months.</i>

08:08.822 --> 08:12.891
Finally, my schedule allowed me
<i>to accept an invitation.</i>

08:17.697 --> 08:20.065
<i>We had such</i>
<i>a beautiful day together.</i>

08:23.102 --> 08:25.470
Ichabod, we must find
our gracious host.

08:25.472 --> 08:29.040
Welcome to fredericks manor.
May I take your coat?

08:29.042 --> 08:30.709
Thank you.
<i>The manor belonged</i>
<i>to lachlan fredericks.</i>

08:30.711 --> 08:34.646
<i>I knew of him as a</i>
<i>dedicated supporter of the war,</i>

08:34.648 --> 08:36.047
<i>A close friend of washington',</i>

08:36.049 --> 08:38.483
<i>But I had no knowledge</i>
<i>of his other causes.</i>

08:38.485 --> 08:41.219
Look around, my love.
What do you see?

08:41.221 --> 08:42.954
They're all free.

08:42.956 --> 08:44.823
They choose to work here.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.993
This estate is
a safe haven.

08:47.995 --> 08:50.495
A place for anyone
seeking refuge.

08:50.497 --> 08:53.398
Is that not beautiful?

08:53.400 --> 08:55.901
<i>Everyone there, regardless</i>
<i>of the color of their skin,</i>

08:55.903 --> 08:59.404
<i>Was free and guaranteed</i>
<i>lachlan's protection.</i>

08:59.406 --> 09:01.506
<i>This was a sanctuary.</i>

09:01.508 --> 09:03.441
(crow cawing)

09:05.745 --> 09:09.314
Most of the manor's visitors
were former slaves.

09:09.316 --> 09:12.350
Many of them remained
in lachlan's employment,

09:12.352 --> 09:15.053
Earning a fair wage,
as every human should.

09:15.055 --> 09:19.524
I can't fathom how such beauty
fell into such ruin.

09:19.526 --> 09:22.994
Or why somebody who dated george
clooney would want to buy it.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.330
An... An irishman?

09:28.167 --> 09:30.735
(cawing)

09:30.737 --> 09:33.104
(door creaks)

09:34.907 --> 09:37.008
Miss gilbert?

09:37.944 --> 09:40.512
Unbelievable.

09:43.015 --> 09:44.749
Sheriff's department!

09:44.751 --> 09:47.752
Let me see your hands!

09:49.589 --> 09:52.023
Show me your hands now!

10:00.933 --> 10:02.467
Lord...

10:04.070 --> 10:05.904
His face.

10:05.906 --> 10:08.139
(crows cawing in distance)

10:10.109 --> 10:11.910
Looks like some kind
of animal attack.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.011
Crane:
Mm.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.486
Sam calvern.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.788
Works for a private
security company.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.090
I'm gonna
assume this guy

10:25.092 --> 10:26.658
Was with lena.

10:26.660 --> 10:27.359
Lieutenant...

10:29.929 --> 10:33.331
They're fresh.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.333
Looks like she was
dragged away from here.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.535
Miss gilbert may still be alive.

10:38.938 --> 10:41.673
Charlie-six-two,

10:41.675 --> 10:43.908
Requesting additional units.

10:43.910 --> 10:46.745
Six-two, did you copy?

10:50.249 --> 10:52.117
No signal.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.518
Gonna try outside.

11:00.526 --> 11:02.127
Jammed shut.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.162
Allow me.

11:04.164 --> 11:07.332
There's gotta be another
way out of here.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.433
(gasps)

11:09.969 --> 11:12.671
(doors slamming shut)

11:14.607 --> 11:15.774
This is not happening.

11:15.776 --> 11:17.876
Not to be an alarmist...

11:17.878 --> 11:20.378
(doors slamming shut)

11:20.380 --> 11:23.515
(slamming stops)
but we're in a damn
haunted house.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.151
Crane: <i>I cannot move any of</i>
<i>these boards or windows,</i>

12:00.153 --> 12:01.786
<i>And I agree, yes,</i>
<i>this is intolerable.</i>

12:04.023 --> 12:06.024
I am not staying in here.

12:06.026 --> 12:08.793
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

12:09.929 --> 12:11.062
That is not going to happen.

12:11.064 --> 12:12.497
We're trapped in here.

12:12.499 --> 12:14.833
Likely for a reason.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.234
I'm uncertain what this house
desires from us,

12:16.236 --> 12:17.602
Or miss gilbert.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.671
If she's still alive,

12:19.673 --> 12:21.940
I assume our best course
of action is to locate her

12:21.942 --> 12:24.109
And ensure her safety.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.111
Right. Good plan.

12:32.284 --> 12:33.284
Hello?

12:33.286 --> 12:35.420
Lieutenant?

12:35.422 --> 12:37.122
Where are you going?

12:38.524 --> 12:40.725
Did you see her?
Who?

12:40.727 --> 12:43.128
The woman.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.929
She was right
in front of us.
What woman?

12:44.931 --> 12:49.134
(wood creaking, eerie whooshing,
indistinct whispering)

12:49.136 --> 12:51.269
All right.

12:51.271 --> 12:54.439
We've faced witches,

12:54.441 --> 12:56.207
A headless rider of death,

12:56.209 --> 12:58.910
A demon who invades our dreams,

12:58.912 --> 13:02.480
I'm sure we can brave
this little crisis.

13:02.482 --> 13:04.082
I am saying haunted houses
do not work for me.

13:04.084 --> 13:07.318
Not as a child,
not now, not ever.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.720
There's a line.

13:08.722 --> 13:09.988
She's not here.

13:09.990 --> 13:11.556
Let's move on.

13:11.558 --> 13:12.891
Wait...

13:14.727 --> 13:16.995
<i>Gulliver's travels.</i>

13:16.997 --> 13:18.797
Swift.

13:18.799 --> 13:21.232
Katrina's favorite novel.

13:21.234 --> 13:23.802
She owned a copy
identical to this.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.177
What is it?
It's a letter.

13:34.513 --> 13:36.080
It survived all
these years.

13:36.082 --> 13:37.982
Addressed to katrina?

13:37.984 --> 13:39.918
One I wrote to her.

13:39.920 --> 13:42.353
The morning I faced
the horseman.

13:42.355 --> 13:46.157
(men shouting, guns firing)

13:46.159 --> 13:47.926
"my beloved.

13:47.928 --> 13:49.961
"if this missive reaches you,

13:49.963 --> 13:52.197
"it means the worst
has come to pass

13:52.199 --> 13:53.965
And I have fallen in battle."

13:53.967 --> 13:56.167
I had asked washington's
aide-de-camp to deliver it

13:56.169 --> 14:00.538
Should my mission to confront
the horseman prove fatal.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.473
Which he would have done,

14:02.475 --> 14:04.008
Several days later.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.310
She must have returned here

14:05.312 --> 14:07.011
While you were buried.

14:07.013 --> 14:10.048
And leave my letter
in her favorite book?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.816
It's as though I was
meant to find it.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.852
I don't understand.
Me neither.

14:13.854 --> 14:15.119
Something's not right about it.

14:15.121 --> 14:17.388
(creaking, whooshing,
wings fluttering)

14:20.893 --> 14:22.994
We gotta find this woman.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.996
Miss gilbert?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.564
Sheriff's department.

14:26.566 --> 14:27.899
(crow caws)
lena?

14:27.901 --> 14:29.868
Ooh! (gasps)

14:29.870 --> 14:34.005
So it wasn't
like this before,

14:34.007 --> 14:36.007
All haunted and with crows?

14:36.009 --> 14:37.842
No...

14:37.844 --> 14:40.245
At the height of the war,
this was a place of hope,

14:40.247 --> 14:43.448
A force for good.

14:50.589 --> 14:53.024
(crystal tinkles brightly)

14:53.026 --> 14:55.260
Crane:
<i>When we finally met our host,</i>

14:55.262 --> 14:57.195
<i>He was charming, warm,</i>
<i>intelligent--</i>

14:57.197 --> 14:58.763
<i>Everything washington</i>
<i>said he'd be.</i>

14:58.765 --> 15:01.699
Ichabod crane,

15:01.701 --> 15:04.535
I am your most ardent
admirer, sir.

15:04.537 --> 15:07.005
May I present our house matron.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.908
Mrs. Grace dixon,
your reputation for helping

15:09.910 --> 15:11.709
Those in need precedes you.

15:11.711 --> 15:13.511
(crows cawing)
crane:
<i>In retrospect,</i>

15:13.513 --> 15:15.780
<i>It is very possible that</i>
<i>their home was also a refuge</i>

15:15.782 --> 15:17.448
<i>From supernatural threats.</i>

15:17.450 --> 15:19.083
(crows cawing)

15:19.085 --> 15:21.119
<i>Lachlan and grace</i>
<i>talked of evil.</i>

15:21.121 --> 15:22.754
Considering the state
of this place,

15:22.756 --> 15:26.291
It stands to reason
that some demonic force

15:26.293 --> 15:27.558
Caught up with them,

15:27.560 --> 15:29.761
Targeted this place,

15:29.763 --> 15:32.330
Turned it from a sanctuary
to a prison.

15:34.133 --> 15:36.935
If someone or something
had it out for lachlan,

15:36.937 --> 15:38.937
Maybe they've had it out
for lena, too.

15:38.939 --> 15:40.104
She is his descendant.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.973
You may well be right.

15:41.975 --> 15:45.310
(creaking, discordant echoes)

15:50.049 --> 15:53.151
More evidence
of miss gilbert's struggle.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.154
(creaking and rustling
echo from below)

15:56.156 --> 15:57.956
After you.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.390
I insist.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.232
Crane:
Miss gilbert?

16:19.845 --> 16:22.146
The closet.

16:23.015 --> 16:25.316
(hinges creaking)

16:25.318 --> 16:27.418
(muffled shouts)

16:27.420 --> 16:30.088
My god. Miss gilbert,
we are here to help you.

16:33.258 --> 16:34.959
We've got you.
(crying)

16:34.961 --> 16:37.428
Lena:
No, don't do that.

16:37.430 --> 16:40.832
(lena sobbing)

16:40.834 --> 16:42.967
Crane...?

16:42.969 --> 16:44.969
(wood crackling)

16:44.971 --> 16:46.871
(crow screeches)

16:49.208 --> 16:51.109
(crow screeches)

16:59.051 --> 17:01.552
(crows continue screeching)

17:04.390 --> 17:05.890
(gasping)

17:05.892 --> 17:08.059
Please... You don't understand--

17:08.061 --> 17:09.727
This house is alive!
(crane grunts)

17:14.299 --> 17:16.901
Abbie:
We've got you.

17:16.903 --> 17:19.070
The roots... They dragged me.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.905
They wouldn't let me go.
Here. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.073
I don't know what it was.

17:22.075 --> 17:23.508
It's okay. Breathe.

17:23.510 --> 17:25.410
Come and sit, come and sit,
come and sit.
Breathe.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.912
All right,
look at me.

17:27.914 --> 17:30.715
Hello.
Now, it's my understanding

17:30.717 --> 17:33.084
That you are a descendant
of the man who lived here,

17:33.086 --> 17:34.986
Lachlan fredericks.

17:34.988 --> 17:38.089
He was an ally
to a great and true cause,

17:38.091 --> 17:40.725
And as brave a soul
as I ever met.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.061
So why don't we honor his memory

17:43.063 --> 17:45.596
By getting out of this nightmare
in one piece?

17:48.000 --> 17:50.401
Irving:
<i>Mills, where are you?</i>

17:50.403 --> 17:52.103
Just 'cause it's the holidays,

17:52.105 --> 17:53.404
Doesn't mean you don't have
to check in.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.107
Call me back.
Your sister's here.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.042
I'm dealing with her b.S.

17:58.044 --> 18:00.278
Someone's in a mood.
Yeah, you have no idea.

18:00.280 --> 18:02.080
You better have
what I asked for.

18:03.549 --> 18:05.183
Thanks for the loaner.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.952
You stole that.
We were fighting demons

18:07.954 --> 18:09.187
That were trying to
bust out the horseman.

18:09.189 --> 18:10.621
There was a lot of confusion.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.558
I lost track of what gun
belongs to where.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.860
I left you that message
five days ago.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.362
I'm here now, aren't I?
The rest?

18:19.932 --> 18:21.632
Come on, don't waste my time.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.367
I thought it
was a gift.

18:23.369 --> 18:24.936
You know, for helping
save everyone's ass?

18:24.938 --> 18:26.070
Cigars are a gift.

18:26.072 --> 18:28.940
Jewelry is a gift.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.942
Maybe I'm a different
kind of girl.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.543
This conversation is over.

18:32.545 --> 18:34.912
So...
As in, you leave.

18:34.914 --> 18:37.949
Fine.

18:37.951 --> 18:40.017
It was a stupid idea anyway.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.555
What?

18:44.557 --> 18:46.157
It's just,
it's the holidays...

18:46.159 --> 18:48.392
And...?
Nothing. Forget it.

18:50.963 --> 18:53.831
I was thinking of having people
over for thanksgiving dinner

18:53.833 --> 18:56.100
To say thank you to abbie
for taking me in,

18:56.102 --> 18:58.769
And I thought, you know,

18:58.771 --> 19:00.805
If you didn't have plans...

19:00.807 --> 19:03.107
You're gonna cook?

19:03.109 --> 19:05.176
I can cook.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.812
So this is a normal
dinner type thing.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.081
You make turkey and gravy,
I bring some pie.

19:10.083 --> 19:13.584
Crane and mills
will be there?
Yep.

19:13.586 --> 19:16.120
We act like normal people
for a change.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.989
One night only, I promise.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.190
Then I go back to stealing
from you.

19:19.192 --> 19:20.858
(chuckles)

19:20.860 --> 19:23.961
That's funny.
Um, am I interrupting?

19:23.963 --> 19:25.596
Macey is here.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.797
I-I can come back.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.065
No, no, this is jenny mills.

19:31.503 --> 19:32.904
And, uh, I was just leaving.

19:33.939 --> 19:36.774
Hey, I wasn't expecting you.

19:40.012 --> 19:42.113
Aw, my little bean.

19:44.016 --> 19:46.117
Abbie: There's gotta be
another way out.

19:46.119 --> 19:49.320
Another exit we haven't
thought of yet.

19:49.322 --> 19:52.690
Miss gilbert, you left a note
on your desk.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.693
You'd circled the name
"katrina c."

19:55.695 --> 19:58.129
Um... Katrina crane.

19:59.231 --> 20:02.466
I found her name in a registry
from the late 1700s.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.001
She was the last person
who came here for sanctuary

20:04.003 --> 20:06.070
Before the manor was abandoned.

20:06.072 --> 20:08.239
My name is ichabod crane.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.208
Katrina was my...

20:10.210 --> 20:13.878
...Relative.
He's related to her.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.814
Would you mind telling us
what you're doing here?

20:16.816 --> 20:21.085
Um, this place has always been
a family mystery.

20:21.087 --> 20:22.887
No one knows
what happened to it

20:22.889 --> 20:25.489
Or to my great-great-great-
whatever-grandfather lachlan.

20:25.491 --> 20:27.325
When I found that registry
with katrina on it,

20:27.327 --> 20:30.895
I thought maybe I'd found the
key to unlocking the truth.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.863
So I bought the manor back
and came here,

20:32.865 --> 20:35.099
Hoping something
would make sense.

20:35.101 --> 20:37.368
And yet you've found no clue
as to what dark force

20:37.370 --> 20:39.170
Took hold of this refuge?

20:39.172 --> 20:41.005
Just a legend that lachlan

20:41.007 --> 20:43.241
Was more than
a passionate abolitionist.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.209
That he was also involved
in witchcraft.

20:45.211 --> 20:49.213
That might explain why katrina
was so keen to visit this place.

20:49.215 --> 20:53.117
If your ancestor
was a warlock,

20:53.119 --> 20:55.052
Using witchcraft
to protect those

20:55.054 --> 20:56.854
Seeking refuge on his property,

20:56.856 --> 20:59.523
Perhaps he was a member of my...

20:59.525 --> 21:02.159
Relative's coven.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.198
Did you just say "coven"?

21:09.067 --> 21:10.935
Katrina was a witch,

21:10.937 --> 21:13.638
And a very dear friend
of your forefather's.

21:13.640 --> 21:16.440
When I freed you from
those roots, they bled.

21:16.442 --> 21:20.077
Whatever malevolent being
attacked this house,

21:20.079 --> 21:22.913
Triumphing over
lachlan's protections,

21:22.915 --> 21:25.650
It has infested
the property.

21:25.652 --> 21:26.917
Abbie: Something terrible
happened here.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.920
And it had something to do
with katrina.

21:29.922 --> 21:32.657
There must be some answer,

21:32.659 --> 21:34.325
Something
in your research.

21:34.327 --> 21:37.128
Possibly, but all of it's
back in new york.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.163
(creaking, eerie whooshing
and whispering)

21:39.165 --> 21:42.266
(rustling, deep growling)

21:42.268 --> 21:43.567
Okay, it's time to go.

21:43.569 --> 21:45.169
What is it?
Quickly.

21:46.471 --> 21:49.006
Crane, there was
something back there.

21:49.008 --> 21:50.574
Something bigger.

21:50.576 --> 21:52.576
Yes, I saw.

21:52.578 --> 21:55.112
(wings fluttering, caws echoing)

21:55.114 --> 21:56.681
We can't stay here.

21:56.683 --> 21:58.649
Where would you
have us go?

22:02.587 --> 22:06.590
(glass shattering)

22:11.029 --> 22:12.430
Everyone...

22:16.201 --> 22:18.402
Abbie: Go ahead.
I'm right behind you.

22:21.540 --> 22:24.608
Lachlan must have built these
for runaway slaves to hide.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.210
It's all right.
Don't worry.

22:26.212 --> 22:28.512
Lieutenant, come on!

22:34.553 --> 22:36.120
Crane!

22:36.122 --> 22:38.756
Crane:
Lieutenant! Down here!

22:39.991 --> 22:42.193
(panting)

22:43.528 --> 22:45.062
(crackling)
(gasps)

22:45.064 --> 22:48.733
(crackling, creaking)

22:48.735 --> 22:50.401
Crane:
Lieutenant!

22:50.403 --> 22:52.603
(panting)

22:53.538 --> 22:55.206
Stand back.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.875
(grunting)

23:02.314 --> 23:04.615
Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

23:07.085 --> 23:08.953
Lieutenant, give me your hand.

23:12.257 --> 23:12.990
(yells)

23:14.426 --> 23:15.159
(gasps)

23:24.703 --> 23:26.670
(crows cawing)
(crane and lena shouting)

23:26.672 --> 23:28.239
(lena yells)

23:28.241 --> 23:29.740
(cawing continues)

23:30.709 --> 23:32.076
(cawing stops)

23:33.111 --> 23:34.745
Miss gilbert...

23:34.747 --> 23:35.913
Oh, no.

23:35.915 --> 23:38.416
Abbie:
Crane? Where are you?

23:38.418 --> 23:42.319
(eerie, distorted voices;
wood crackling)

23:43.288 --> 23:45.289
(wood creaking)

23:45.291 --> 23:48.192
Crane?

23:58.470 --> 24:01.038
(creaking, cracking)

24:08.380 --> 24:11.382
(crackling)

24:11.384 --> 24:13.150
(gasps)

24:25.063 --> 24:27.131
(panting)

24:28.600 --> 24:31.135
(continues panting)

24:35.407 --> 24:37.908
(wood creaking)

24:40.579 --> 24:42.813
(echoes):
It's time.

24:46.685 --> 24:48.986
Hey.

24:48.988 --> 24:50.354
Ex-excuse me...

24:51.356 --> 24:54.859
(creaking)

24:55.827 --> 24:58.128
That was good, mills.

24:58.130 --> 25:00.631
Talk to the ghost.

25:00.633 --> 25:03.033
Macey:
<i>Excuse me.</i>

25:03.035 --> 25:04.835
Coming through.

25:04.837 --> 25:06.003
Excuse me.

25:06.005 --> 25:07.071
Thank you.

25:10.175 --> 25:13.010
Not gonna say hello?

25:15.146 --> 25:16.614
I mean...

25:16.616 --> 25:18.182
You're dating my dad--
there's no point

25:18.184 --> 25:19.450
Being a coward about it.

25:19.452 --> 25:21.185
We have to meet
at some point.

25:21.187 --> 25:22.720
I'm not dating your dad.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.788
I don't even
really like your dad.

25:25.790 --> 25:28.092
Sometimes me, either.

25:29.494 --> 25:30.995
Macey.

25:30.997 --> 25:32.997
Jenny.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.665
You're so not a cop.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.300
(laughs):
Definitely not.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.068
My sister is.

25:38.070 --> 25:39.503
Must be cool.

25:39.505 --> 25:42.306
Having a sister to look out
for you like that.

25:42.308 --> 25:44.141
Uh, yeah. Can be.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.010
She's a bit of a hard-ass.

25:46.012 --> 25:49.013
(laughs softly)
try growing up with my dad.

25:49.015 --> 25:51.181
Honestly, I can't even imagine.

25:51.183 --> 25:54.051
Well, you know, it's better now.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.887
He works here;
I live in the city.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.422
The man's always
busy, so,

25:58.424 --> 26:00.157
You know,
I don't really have to deal

26:00.159 --> 26:01.592
With his bs much of the time.

26:02.928 --> 26:04.895
Just me and my mom.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.097
I'm cool with that.

26:07.099 --> 26:10.534
I never had
much of a mom or dad.

26:10.536 --> 26:13.103
Don't know what it's
supposed to be like, but...

26:13.105 --> 26:14.972
Maybe give him a chance.

26:17.108 --> 26:19.176
He's not a completely
terrible person.

26:20.679 --> 26:22.980
Just some friendly advice.

26:26.017 --> 26:28.118
Irving:
<i>I know it's not the most</i>

26:28.120 --> 26:29.920
Romantic spot, but...
(sighs)

26:29.922 --> 26:31.922
It's private.

26:31.924 --> 26:34.758
I'll make this brief.
I know, um, I know you're busy.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.528
Just so you know, there is
nothing going on between...

26:37.530 --> 26:40.731
Whatever you do on your own time
is-is none of my business.

26:40.733 --> 26:44.535
But how you behave
as a parent is.

26:44.537 --> 26:47.905
One weekend-- that's all
macey's seen from you

26:47.907 --> 26:49.273
Since you
transferred here.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.975
One weekend.

26:50.977 --> 26:53.577
All she knows is-is
"something came up."

26:53.579 --> 26:56.113
I call every day, cynthia...

26:56.115 --> 26:57.648
You know what?

26:57.650 --> 26:59.483
It's not working.

26:59.485 --> 27:01.986
When you were
assigned here...

27:01.988 --> 27:04.555
It was supposed to be
better for everyone.

27:04.557 --> 27:06.790
Smaller town, easier...

27:06.792 --> 27:09.460
Workload, a place where macey
can get out of the city.

27:09.462 --> 27:10.995
<i>Your</i> words.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.997
I'll make it up to her.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.264
(sighs)

27:14.266 --> 27:17.768
All I see is
a small-town precinct...

27:17.770 --> 27:20.337
A  <i>tenth</i>of the size
of your old one.

27:20.339 --> 27:23.674
What could possibly be such
a challenge in sleepy hollow?

27:23.676 --> 27:25.075
Cynthia...

27:25.077 --> 27:26.977
I know it doesn't make sense,

27:26.979 --> 27:29.446
But the work I'm doing here
is important.

27:29.448 --> 27:33.017
Okay. Well, then why can't you
have someone else handle it?

27:33.019 --> 27:34.752
(chuckles):
I can't.

27:34.754 --> 27:38.422
It has to be me.
Do you hear
yourself?

27:38.424 --> 27:41.258
Is this the kind of father
you want to be?

27:41.260 --> 27:43.360
I'm trying, cynthia.

27:43.362 --> 27:45.596
I want to make things
right with macey.

27:45.598 --> 27:47.197
That's why I moved here.

27:47.199 --> 27:49.833
What happened, happened.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.468
And we're dealing with it,

27:51.470 --> 27:54.004
She's dealing with it,
and she's doing well.

27:54.006 --> 27:55.673
But it won't last...

27:55.675 --> 27:57.975
If you hide from
your responsibilities

27:57.977 --> 27:59.443
As a father.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.049
(groans)

28:05.051 --> 28:06.850
She needs stability...

28:06.852 --> 28:10.521
Not any more
disappointment.

28:10.523 --> 28:13.891
There's no other way
to say this.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.126
I had some...

28:16.128 --> 28:18.262
Papers drawn up...

28:19.864 --> 28:21.865
...Demanding full custody.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.034
If you cancel

28:24.036 --> 28:27.237
One more weekend...
I will file.

28:27.239 --> 28:29.306
For her sake.

28:32.210 --> 28:34.078
You would do that to me?

28:34.080 --> 28:36.714
This is not me.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.982
This is you, frank.

28:45.657 --> 28:48.058
Abbie:
<i>Crane?</i>

28:48.060 --> 28:50.160
Lena?

28:56.901 --> 28:59.169
(distorted screeches
in distance)

29:00.705 --> 29:02.206
(wood creaking)

29:02.208 --> 29:03.774
It's coming.

29:03.776 --> 29:06.076
Hurry.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.979
(distorted screams in distance)

29:11.716 --> 29:14.017
(gasps)
the pain is rising.
She's close now.

29:14.019 --> 29:15.586
The child is coming.

29:15.588 --> 29:18.489
(woman grunts, pants)

29:20.024 --> 29:22.092
Please, are we safe?
You and your child are safe.

29:22.094 --> 29:26.063
All you need to do is bring
this life into our world.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.531
I can't do it.

29:27.533 --> 29:30.200
(woman shrieks in pain)

29:30.202 --> 29:31.568
Look at me,

29:31.570 --> 29:33.771
Mrs. Crane.

29:33.773 --> 29:35.205
Mrs. Crane:
I can't do this,

29:35.207 --> 29:37.541
Not without ichabod.
You have to.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.109
For your sake

29:39.111 --> 29:40.911
And the child's, hmm?

29:40.913 --> 29:42.045
Now, breathe.

29:42.047 --> 29:42.946
(pained grunt)

29:42.948 --> 29:44.481
(gasping)

29:44.483 --> 29:46.150
That's it!

29:46.152 --> 29:47.151
That's it.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.919
You're doing
beautifully.

29:48.921 --> 29:51.321
Now push...
Push, katrina!

29:51.323 --> 29:53.323
(grunting)
push!

29:53.325 --> 29:54.591
(loud grunting)

29:54.593 --> 29:56.927
Push!
(shrieking)

29:56.929 --> 29:58.428
Good. That's it.
A blanket.

29:58.430 --> 30:00.130
The baby's coming.
Now...

30:00.132 --> 30:02.766
(crows cawing)
(katrina shrieking)

30:02.768 --> 30:04.735
Strength, now.

30:04.737 --> 30:06.069
Push!

30:06.071 --> 30:08.005
(shrieking)
good. That's it.

30:09.307 --> 30:11.942
(crows cawing)
(baby crying)

30:11.944 --> 30:13.644
(gasping, groaning)

30:15.113 --> 30:16.980
Ah...

30:16.982 --> 30:19.249
(baby cries briefly)

30:20.952 --> 30:22.986
(baby fusses quietly)
oh...

30:24.923 --> 30:26.523
Mrs. Crane...
(laughs)

30:26.525 --> 30:27.991
It's a boy.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.560
I have a son.

30:31.930 --> 30:34.097
(cries briefly)

30:36.801 --> 30:39.169
(laughs):
I have a son.

30:40.371 --> 30:43.307
(baby fusses, cries)
shh, shh.

30:43.309 --> 30:46.343
(stops crying)
(laughs):
I have a son.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.011
Shh...

30:48.013 --> 30:50.781
(baby burbles)

30:50.783 --> 30:52.783
(laughs)

30:52.785 --> 30:55.252
He has ichabod's eyes.

31:05.997 --> 31:08.532
(deep creaking, rumbling)

31:15.039 --> 31:17.074
Lieutenant,
shh, shh, shh.

31:17.076 --> 31:19.409
This way.

31:19.411 --> 31:20.878
What happened to you?

31:20.880 --> 31:23.080
Where is lena?
The creature took her.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.082
Dragged her away
like a toy.

31:25.084 --> 31:26.717
I couldn't stop him.

31:26.719 --> 31:28.652
Obviously, the creature
is more than simply an agent

31:28.654 --> 31:30.520
Of destruction.
Crane, I need to
tell you something.

31:30.522 --> 31:32.489
He infested this place
for a reason.
Crane...

31:32.491 --> 31:33.924
Crane...

31:33.926 --> 31:35.993
This was an attack,
aimed at lachlan,

31:35.995 --> 31:38.328
Who I'm not certain
is in league with katrina,

31:38.330 --> 31:41.031
Perhaps even a part
of her coven...
It was katrina.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.100
Supernatural powers...
I saw katrina giving birth.

31:43.102 --> 31:45.402
..Just...

31:45.404 --> 31:47.938
What did you say?

31:47.940 --> 31:50.407
Downstairs.

31:50.409 --> 31:53.176
I had a vision.

31:53.178 --> 31:55.178
I saw what
happened here.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.880
Katrina came back here

31:56.882 --> 31:59.483
Because she was
going to have a baby.

32:01.886 --> 32:03.887
No.

32:03.889 --> 32:05.455
(gasps)

32:05.457 --> 32:09.092
No, I'm sorry,
you must be mistaken.

32:09.094 --> 32:12.095
She would have told me.

32:12.097 --> 32:15.365
Or she needed
to keep it secret.

32:15.367 --> 32:18.201
If lachlan was really part
of katrina's coven,

32:18.203 --> 32:21.305
It would have made sense for her
to come here and give birth.

32:25.143 --> 32:27.311
(crow cawing)
(katrina gasping in pain)

32:28.947 --> 32:31.248
I'm afraid.
Hurry, get
her inside.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.483
(crow cawing)

32:33.485 --> 32:38.121
She would have figured the
protective hex he placed

32:38.123 --> 32:40.891
On the property...
Would keep her

32:40.893 --> 32:43.126
And your baby safe.

32:43.128 --> 32:45.162
(sighs)

32:47.966 --> 32:50.767
What was it?

32:50.769 --> 32:53.270
The baby.

32:53.272 --> 32:54.972
(baby cries briefly)

32:54.974 --> 32:56.974
(gasping)

32:56.976 --> 32:58.408
It was a son.

32:58.410 --> 33:01.044
You had a son.

33:05.783 --> 33:08.118
Crane, there's more.

33:08.120 --> 33:10.954
Something happened
during the birth.

33:10.956 --> 33:13.190
What happened?

33:15.793 --> 33:19.363
Ichabod would be...
Overjoyed, katrina.

33:19.365 --> 33:21.865
(baby cooing)

33:21.867 --> 33:24.001
(crows cawing,
banging on window)

33:24.003 --> 33:25.769
(glass breaking, banging)

33:25.771 --> 33:27.604
(cawing continues, baby crying)

33:27.606 --> 33:29.973
Lachlan, what's going on?

33:29.975 --> 33:31.942
They've broken
through the protections.

33:31.944 --> 33:33.944
(baby crying)
abbie:
Something came after the baby,

33:33.946 --> 33:38.015
<i>Beating the hex</i>
<i>by growing inside the property.</i>

33:38.017 --> 33:39.683
<i>That creature, the evil</i>

33:39.685 --> 33:41.685
In this house,

33:41.687 --> 33:44.888
Attacked the moment your child
was brought into this world.

33:44.890 --> 33:49.026
Lachlan did everything
he could to protect them.

33:49.028 --> 33:52.996
<i>Lachlan knew this creature</i>
<i>had to be sent by moloch.</i>

33:52.998 --> 33:55.599
Take them now.
Use my personal carriage. Go.

33:56.834 --> 33:59.302
(crows cawing,
banging on window)

34:04.409 --> 34:06.743
(wood creaking)

34:06.745 --> 34:07.978
(gagging)

34:15.019 --> 34:20.057
(baby crying)

34:20.059 --> 34:21.091
Abbie...

34:22.360 --> 34:26.596
What happened to my son?

34:28.533 --> 34:31.134
Please.

34:32.036 --> 34:34.704
I need to know.

34:34.706 --> 34:37.240
I don't know.

34:37.242 --> 34:39.743
That's all I saw.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.679
Then he could have survived.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.247
They both could have
escaped the creature.

34:44.249 --> 34:46.516
Crane...
(woman screaming)

34:49.287 --> 34:51.988
(wood creaking)

35:04.936 --> 35:07.804
Miss gilbert,
are you all right?

35:07.806 --> 35:10.540
(shuddering breaths):
No...

35:12.043 --> 35:14.344
No...

35:24.055 --> 35:25.455
Miss gilbert!

35:28.926 --> 35:30.594
(screaming)

35:30.596 --> 35:32.562
Lena!
Can't get a clean shot!

35:36.000 --> 35:37.167
Go! Run!

35:37.169 --> 35:40.137
(creature bellowing)

35:40.139 --> 35:41.638
Where did she go?

35:41.640 --> 35:44.407
I don't know.

35:45.409 --> 35:47.844
Lieutenant... The roots!

35:52.116 --> 35:53.583
(creature screeching)

35:53.585 --> 35:55.152
He's felt it!

35:55.154 --> 35:57.387
(creature screaming)

35:58.990 --> 36:01.258
(blade slashes, crane yells)

36:01.260 --> 36:03.193
How do we escape?

36:10.868 --> 36:11.935
This way.

36:13.471 --> 36:16.239
(baby crying, door opening)

36:19.177 --> 36:20.844
Crane:
Lieutenant!
(abbie gasps)

36:20.846 --> 36:22.445
I found a way out.

36:25.383 --> 36:26.449
This way!

36:34.492 --> 36:37.894
(hinges creaking)

36:47.205 --> 36:49.706
What are you doing?

36:49.708 --> 36:51.041
Stay with miss gilbert.

36:51.043 --> 36:52.876
My business here
isn't finished.

36:52.878 --> 36:54.911
Crane...
That thing came
after my son!

36:54.913 --> 36:57.047
Listen to me-- we're gonna
make this thing right.

36:57.049 --> 36:59.716
You just have
to stay with me!
Keep her safe.

36:59.718 --> 37:01.384
Crane!
Heed my words.

37:01.386 --> 37:04.588
Do not follow me.

37:17.935 --> 37:19.502
(roots crackling, rustling)

37:21.539 --> 37:23.006
(growling)

37:38.389 --> 37:42.359
(growling)

37:45.129 --> 37:47.197
(grunting)

37:48.399 --> 37:49.799
(growling)

37:49.801 --> 37:52.369
I know who you serve.

37:53.371 --> 37:56.039
I know why you came here.

37:56.041 --> 37:59.175
(crane yells)

38:02.246 --> 38:03.947
Did you think you could attack

38:03.949 --> 38:06.983
Those I love
without consequence?!

38:06.985 --> 38:10.453
Huh? That you could come
for my wife?

38:10.455 --> 38:14.257
(eerie screeching)

38:14.259 --> 38:15.892
My child?!

38:18.229 --> 38:20.063
(bellowing, growling)

38:20.065 --> 38:21.298
(crane grunts, creature growls)

38:23.000 --> 38:24.868
(snarling)

38:25.770 --> 38:27.337
Give moloch my regards.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.406
(creature growls)

38:42.586 --> 38:45.088
(cawing)

38:46.324 --> 38:48.325
(cawing)

38:48.327 --> 38:50.026
My god.

38:50.028 --> 38:53.263
I should like to go home now.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.068
(crow caws)

39:04.842 --> 39:07.177
(engine starts)

39:08.713 --> 39:11.081
(crows cawing)

39:23.894 --> 39:26.396
Hey.

39:26.398 --> 39:29.499
There you are.

39:29.501 --> 39:32.068
So, I'm thinking...

39:32.070 --> 39:33.870
Jenny's burnt turkey
and gluten-free pumpkin pie

39:33.872 --> 39:36.940
Might be just what you need
to lift your spirits.

39:38.743 --> 39:42.712
Okay, it's not the greatest
sales pitch.

39:42.714 --> 39:45.715
There will be rum.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.650
It's your favorite.

39:47.652 --> 39:50.053
Barbadian best amber.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.654
I believe I would
not have survived

39:51.656 --> 39:53.590
Valley forge without it.

39:55.359 --> 39:58.294
I'm much obliged, miss mills.

40:00.097 --> 40:04.734
But in my present state, I fear
I would not be pleasant company.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.036
Look...

40:07.038 --> 40:11.708
Thanksgiving isn't easy
for everyone.

40:11.710 --> 40:14.010
When I was a kid,
I remember...

40:14.012 --> 40:16.446
Walking on the street,
passing houses on my block,

40:16.448 --> 40:18.548
Looking in windows,

40:18.550 --> 40:21.418
Seeing people, families,

40:21.420 --> 40:23.853
Sitting around tables, laughing,

40:23.855 --> 40:25.722
Carving turkeys.

40:25.724 --> 40:28.358
I was just so envious.

40:28.360 --> 40:31.127
I wanted that
more than anything.

40:31.129 --> 40:34.931
I had it... In England.

40:34.933 --> 40:37.100
During my
father's holidays

40:37.102 --> 40:39.569
From teaching at oxford,

40:39.571 --> 40:42.639
I would sit by the hearth,

40:42.641 --> 40:47.477
And he'd regale me
with glorious tales

40:47.479 --> 40:49.913
Of ancient greece.

40:49.915 --> 40:52.916
And I really
believed I'd follow

40:52.918 --> 40:54.884
His footsteps...

40:54.886 --> 40:57.654
I'd be a professor
in my own right,

40:57.656 --> 40:59.923
Yet upheld

40:59.925 --> 41:02.826
By his pride for me.

41:02.828 --> 41:04.727
And that one day,

41:04.729 --> 41:06.963
I would have a son,

41:06.965 --> 41:09.499
And I'd share that same comfort

41:09.501 --> 41:11.634
That I felt so freely.

41:11.636 --> 41:15.238
I'm guess that's what
the point of this is?

41:15.240 --> 41:18.508
The time for reflection.

41:18.510 --> 41:21.144
You see what you have now,

41:21.146 --> 41:23.713
And you embrace
what's in front of you.

41:28.619 --> 41:32.055
Oh, I nearly forgot.

41:33.123 --> 41:36.125
This arrived
for you this afternoon.

41:36.127 --> 41:38.495
More treasures from
the amazon, perhaps.

41:38.497 --> 41:40.563
It's from lena gilbert.

41:41.799 --> 41:43.867
(clearing her throat)

41:47.538 --> 41:50.773
The records from fredericks
manor throughout the years.

41:53.344 --> 41:57.013
Documentation
on mrs. Grace dixon--

41:57.015 --> 41:58.648
The manor's
house matron.

41:58.650 --> 42:01.117
A list of her progeny.

42:04.021 --> 42:06.723
Family tree.

42:10.828 --> 42:12.695
Lori roberts.

42:14.832 --> 42:17.967
My mother.

42:19.670 --> 42:22.238
You're a descendant
of grace dixon.

42:22.240 --> 42:26.709
My ancestor brought your son
into this world.

42:26.711 --> 42:29.078
Quite heroically.

42:30.247 --> 42:33.049
I see the family resemblance.

42:33.051 --> 42:35.218
It seems that
you and I...

42:35.220 --> 42:38.087
Our paths were intertwined
from the very start.

42:38.089 --> 42:40.456
It definitely would seem.

42:44.995 --> 42:47.430
We have a drink.

42:47.432 --> 42:49.465
It's a day
of giving thanks.

42:59.243 --> 43:01.110
To family.

43:01.112 --> 43:03.346
To finding family.

43:07.685 --> 43:09.352
