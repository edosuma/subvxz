Ooh, here you go, love. Stick
'em in the kitchen for me.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.590
Hello!

01:14.640 --> 01:17.510
Hi. Listen, the news here is that, erm...

01:18.040 --> 01:21.590
- .. Angela and I aren't going
out any more. - Oh. Thank you.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.910
- Come on. Cough up. - All
right. - What are you doing?

01:23.960 --> 01:27.550
- If you dump your girlfriend within
six months, I pay a fiver. - Nice (!)

01:27.600 --> 01:30.070
Straight into the kids'
college fund. Adam sorted.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.310
- Moving on to Chloe. - It's our
six-month anniversary today. - Oh.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.550
- What are the rules on that, then?
- I didn't dump her. - She dumped you?

01:36.600 --> 01:40.190
- That's unusually discerning. - That's
a first. - Look, shut up and listen.

01:40.240 --> 01:44.040
The reason why we're not going
out any more is because...

01:44.480 --> 01:46.470
.. we're getting married.

01:46.520 --> 01:49.520
Here, has the erm...?
Has the picture frozen?

01:55.560 --> 01:58.390
- Well, we had to expect it would
happen one day. - Adam marrying?

01:58.440 --> 02:01.870
- It's way too soon.
- Jen, it's 14 years since Rachel died.

02:01.920 --> 02:06.110
- Six months! I mean, he hardly knows
how to pronounce her name. - Angela?

02:06.160 --> 02:08.150
Zubayr, or something.

02:08.199 --> 02:11.430
- Are you going to the wedding?
- Of course. Why wouldn't we?

02:11.480 --> 02:13.670
Do you know how much a
flight to Singapore costs?

02:13.720 --> 02:15.630
Not in economy, no. I always go business.

02:15.680 --> 02:17.830
Anyway, we'll use air
miles. I've got plenty.

02:17.880 --> 02:20.230
I'm very pleased for
you, David. And Robyn.

02:20.280 --> 02:22.560
Girls, your father's here!

02:23.600 --> 02:25.590
Robyn won't want to
take the time off work.

02:25.640 --> 02:28.230
No, I thought that we might go together.

02:28.280 --> 02:32.270
You don't think she'd mind you whisking
your ex off business-class to Singapore?

02:32.320 --> 02:33.950
- Hi, Liv. Hi, Ellie.
- Hi.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.190
- Dad.
- Robyn will be fine with it.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.310

02:48.720 --> 02:50.710
Well? Did you break it to him?

02:50.760 --> 02:53.790
I didn't think the timing was right
so I'll tell him when I see him.

02:53.840 --> 02:55.990
Oh, Pete, look, that is the point.

02:56.040 --> 02:57.910
You know, we can't afford the trip.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.990
Well, he's coming over Wednesday,
just for a couple of days.

03:01.040 --> 03:03.470
Adam is? Really? Why?

03:03.520 --> 03:05.910
Oh, you didn't think to ask, did you?

03:05.960 --> 03:09.200
Well, is he bringing this Angela with him?

03:10.520 --> 03:12.510
No? Nothing?

03:12.560 --> 03:15.790
Right, let's try an easy one. What
time does his plane get in, love?

03:15.840 --> 03:18.350
- 5:30.
- Great. I'll pick him up.

03:18.400 --> 03:19.990
A-M.

03:20.040 --> 03:21.630
Or you can.

03:21.680 --> 03:23.280
Mwah!

03:26.200 --> 03:28.190
Denis Law!

03:28.240 --> 03:29.910
- Hello, mate.
- Hey.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.190
- Mm.
- Here, for you.

03:32.240 --> 03:34.510
- Really? - Mm. - Ooh.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.920
Single malt. Thanks.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
It's evaporation.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.670
- Have you lost weight?
- No.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.710
Have you got more hair?

03:47.760 --> 03:49.350
No.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.000
Maybe.

03:55.720 --> 03:58.390
- No, wait, wait. Not that one.
- Come on!

03:58.440 --> 04:00.830
Oh, yeah. Got it. I love that photo.

04:00.880 --> 04:02.870
- Ooh! - Have you not
got a more recent one?

04:02.920 --> 04:04.590
That is recent.

04:04.640 --> 04:06.230
Ooh.

04:06.280 --> 04:08.230
Well, she's young, isn't she?

04:08.280 --> 04:09.870
Not really. She's 30.

04:09.920 --> 04:13.430
Oh, wow! 18 years younger than you!

04:13.480 --> 04:15.270
It's just a number.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.910
- Mwah!
- Yeah.

04:16.959 --> 04:18.950
18!

04:19.000 --> 04:21.550
- So where did you two meet?
- Oh, it was very romantic.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.590
- Tinder?
- No, not this time.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.510
I was on my way into work.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.670
You know, fed up with the daily commute

04:27.720 --> 04:30.710
when I happened to get talking
to this woman beside me.

04:30.760 --> 04:34.150
The last 14 years, I've
lived all over the world.

04:34.200 --> 04:37.710
Hong Kong, Dubai, Seattle,
now here in Singapore.

04:37.760 --> 04:39.350
Sounds glamorous, eh?

04:39.400 --> 04:41.430
But it doesn't really
matter where you are.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.070
There's always that moment where

04:43.120 --> 04:45.030
the exotic becomes the mundane.

04:45.080 --> 04:48.550
The adventure, the daily grind.

04:48.600 --> 04:51.800
I want a life where the
novelty never wears off.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.740
I know exactly what you mean.

05:00.160 --> 05:02.830
That was all she said.
It was all she had to say.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.550
It was love at first sight.

05:04.600 --> 05:07.510
Well, quicker than that, cos I
hadn't clapped eyes on her yet.

05:07.560 --> 05:10.760
- Well, how did you find
out who she was? - Ah!

05:18.400 --> 05:20.990
This is the Irish guy from the ferry.

05:21.040 --> 05:24.240
I was wondering... are you
free for dinner tonight?

05:25.840 --> 05:29.340
I thought meeting her would
be an anti-climax, but...

05:30.190 --> 05:31.190
.. it was just the opposite.

05:31.240 --> 05:34.240
- A climax?
- No, that was the second time.

05:35.240 --> 05:38.510
And six months later,
you're getting married!

05:38.560 --> 05:41.790
Yeah, moving in together to this
fantastic apartment that we found.

05:41.840 --> 05:43.470
Well, Angela found.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.510
Do she and Matthew get on?

05:45.560 --> 05:47.550
I'm sure they will.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.600
They haven't met?

05:51.520 --> 05:53.510
No... They speak online.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.630
Now he's saying he doesn't
want to come to the wedding.

05:56.680 --> 05:59.470
That's why I'm over here, to try
and talk some sense into him.

05:59.520 --> 06:03.310
- Oh, he's a teenager. Good luck
with that, old pal. - I know.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.150
Well, congratulations.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.510
- We're all delighted for you.
- Yeah.

06:07.560 --> 06:10.750
Well, I hope you'll be as happy as I
thought me and Jenny were gonna be.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.640
Me and Karen too.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.390
Yeah, well... How was your flight?

06:21.440 --> 06:23.430
It was good. Pete met me at the airport.

06:23.480 --> 06:25.470
Something of a surprise.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.910
- Where are you parked?
- Got a cab.

06:27.960 --> 06:29.950
Ah.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
God, it's Baltic.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.510
- I'll do the big one.
- Ah, thanks.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.390
Didsbury, please, mate.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.440
Hi. Are you all right?

06:50.600 --> 06:52.590
Did I mention I'd been laid off?

06:52.640 --> 06:56.470
- About a year ago.
- Still, things are looking up.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.510
I've got two jobs now.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.550
- What's the other one?
- Carer.

07:00.600 --> 07:02.800
Wiping old people's arses.

07:03.640 --> 07:07.630
Pay's not great, but the job
satisfaction more than makes up for it.

07:07.680 --> 07:09.670
- Really?
- No.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.990
Care to join me upfront?

07:12.040 --> 07:14.040
Oh, God, yeah.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.190
What do you mean, you didn't know?

07:18.240 --> 07:20.510
You talk for hours online.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.550
What the hell do you talk about?

07:22.600 --> 07:25.190
- United. - And City. - Mm.

07:25.240 --> 07:27.230
Important stuff.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.270
So what do you reckon?

07:29.320 --> 07:31.590
Well, it's a madness, isn't it?

07:31.640 --> 07:34.510
I mean, he's clearly infatuated.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.390
I mean, you can't blame him.

07:36.440 --> 07:40.310
She's young and sexy and
he's neither, frankly.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.960
Aye-aye.

07:42.040 --> 07:44.030
What are we whispering about?

07:44.080 --> 07:46.550
Adam, we think you might
have lost your mind.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.600
- I didn't say that.
- No, I did, but you were thinking it.

07:50.680 --> 07:54.310
There is quite an age gap and you
haven't known each other long.

07:54.360 --> 07:57.040
Well, yes, you're right, of course.

07:58.120 --> 07:59.710
But you're also wrong.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.750
Do you know how many people I've
been out with since Rachel died?

08:02.800 --> 08:05.390
- Well -- - None, for the
first two years. Two years!

08:05.440 --> 08:08.470
After that, names too numerous to mention,

08:08.520 --> 08:10.910
- but you know what they all
had in common? - Ooh, er...

08:10.960 --> 08:12.950
They were all born in the '80s?

08:13.000 --> 08:15.990
That is true, some of them were,
but none of them were Rachel.

08:16.040 --> 08:19.550
- Of course they couldn't be.
- None of them came close. Nowhere near.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.910
But Angela, she's...

08:21.960 --> 08:23.550
Whoa!

08:23.600 --> 08:25.940
You'll see when you meet her.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.360
Adam, have you actually talked
to Pete about the wedding?

08:35.000 --> 08:37.600
I don't know how to say this, but...

08:38.080 --> 08:40.870
- You want to know if you're my best man?
- No, it's not that.

08:40.919 --> 08:42.510
Of course you are.

08:42.559 --> 08:45.860
- Am I? - Well, I'm hardly
gonna ask David, am I?

08:46.280 --> 08:48.600
So will you do it? Again?

08:51.800 --> 08:54.310
I promise I'll make a
better speech this time.

08:54.360 --> 08:56.080
Good lad.

08:57.120 --> 08:59.110
- Oh, for God's sake!
- What?

08:59.160 --> 09:02.150
OK, Adam, we can't come to your wedding.

09:02.200 --> 09:04.430
I mean, we'd love to, but
we don't have the cash.

09:04.480 --> 09:07.070
- Well, I'll pay for your flights.
- Oh, don't say that.

09:07.120 --> 09:10.350
- At least not to Pete. He's down on himself --
- But you've got to come.

09:10.400 --> 09:12.110
He's my best man. He's my best mate.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.990
- If he can't, it'll have to be David!
- I'm just saying...

09:15.040 --> 09:16.670
- Hiya.
- Hey.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.910
Do you know what? Actually, I have to go.

09:18.960 --> 09:21.190
- I'm due at this Air B&B place.
- I'll give you a lift.

09:21.240 --> 09:24.310
- Mate's rates. - Hey, hey, you've
had a drink. No, lend him your car.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.030
- What?
- Go on, then.

09:26.080 --> 09:29.830
- Oh. All right. There you go. I want
it back, crack of dawn. - All right.

09:30.880 --> 09:34.230
It is so great to see you, to
share my good news with you.

09:34.280 --> 09:37.280
- I know... - Mwah!
- .. how pleased you are.

09:37.440 --> 09:39.440
Goodbye.

09:40.880 --> 09:42.950
That's a car crash waiting to happen.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.070
I hope not. It's my car.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.840
Five...

09:58.280 --> 09:59.870
That was quick.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.510
- Sorry?
- I've only just rung.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.710
OK. Bottom of the road, turn left.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.150
Oh, I see. You think that I'm...

10:06.200 --> 10:08.590
There's a chemist a
couple of minutes away.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.240
Well, come on. I've got to get back.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.790
Come on.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.480
OK.

10:18.520 --> 10:20.990
It's great to see Adam so happy.

10:21.800 --> 10:24.550
So... loved-up as the girls might say.

10:24.600 --> 10:27.430
He sends his regards.
Sorry you couldn't join us.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.990
You might be able to drop
everything, David, I can't,

10:30.040 --> 10:32.710
not if I want to come to the wedding.

10:33.280 --> 10:35.270
You want to come to the wedding?

10:35.320 --> 10:38.620
Mini break in Singapore?
I'm not gonna miss that.

10:40.560 --> 10:42.950
Oh, God! I was pinged
by that speed camera.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.510
On the A56? I told you
you were driving too fast.

10:45.560 --> 10:48.670
Well, point to you, Robyn. That's
three to me, which brings me to 12.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.720
- I'm going to be banned.
- Perhaps you'll be more careful next time.

10:52.800 --> 10:56.200
Which, unless you have grounds
for appeal, will be in six months.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.310
- How many points have you got?
- None.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.030
I'm a careful driver.

11:05.080 --> 11:06.880
So, erm...

11:07.840 --> 11:09.830
- So, you could take
these for me? - What?

11:09.880 --> 11:12.670
Photo's bound to be fuzzy. They
won't know who's at the wheel.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.870
- I can't do that. I'm a lawyer.
- Divorce lawyer.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.270
I'd still be struck off
and sent to prison.

11:17.320 --> 11:20.800
No, David. You did the
crime, you do the time.

11:27.680 --> 11:29.550
Right. Home, James.

11:30.720 --> 11:32.710
Shouldn't really be out.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.960
- Are you not well?
- Just a touch of thrush (!)

11:37.160 --> 11:39.550
No, I'm supposed to wait in for someone.

11:39.600 --> 11:42.140
He's renting this apartment I own.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.030
Sounds like a bit of a
tosser, to be honest.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.950
- What gives you that impression?
- The tone of his e-mails.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.470
"Please find attached, my itinerary."

11:51.520 --> 11:54.230
- Who speaks like that?
- Someone who's articulate.

11:54.280 --> 11:57.480
He's an ex-pat from Singapore.
I bet he's a banker-wanker.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.840
Or he works in IT. A lot
of them do, apparently.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.670
I just hope I get there before he does.

12:04.720 --> 12:06.510
Photo-finish, I reckon.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.550
Well, what do I owe you?

12:08.600 --> 12:10.950
A medical emergency, no charge.

12:11.000 --> 12:12.670
Oh, no, I can't do that.

12:12.720 --> 12:15.470
No, no, no. Can't have you
thinking all men are wankers.

12:15.520 --> 12:17.110
Thank you.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.160
Pleasure.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.600
Didn't I mention? I'm the
wanker from Singapore.

12:34.880 --> 12:37.070
Look, I'm sorry about
that, I hadn't a clue.

12:37.120 --> 12:40.210
- Oh, well, I didn't give you one.
- No, you didn't.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.960
So this is you.

12:44.240 --> 12:46.240
Holy shit.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.390
- Thank you.
- Spare keys, details for the alarm.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.840
I live directly across the hall,
in case there's any complaints.

12:57.920 --> 13:00.260
No, I'm sure I won't have any.

13:00.680 --> 13:03.150
Apart from the "wanker" comment.

13:18.080 --> 13:20.070
Thank you, sir.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.630
- Dad!
- Baby boy!

13:23.180 --> 13:24.350
Hey!

13:24.400 --> 13:27.390
Hello. Wow, son.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.430
Hey, what about your godmum?

13:29.480 --> 13:31.720
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.590
Hello.

13:34.640 --> 13:38.720
Every time I see you, I see your mum.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.510
- We're talking about my wedding.
- I've told you, it's the school play.

13:45.560 --> 13:48.230
- Well, you can skip one performance.
- It's the last night.

13:48.280 --> 13:50.750
So do some earlier in the
week, then fly to Singapore.

13:50.800 --> 13:53.830
No, I can't let people down
and I'd miss the cast party.

13:53.880 --> 13:57.270
What? Whoa! Whoa! Sorry, is
this about letting people down

13:57.320 --> 13:58.950
or missing a party?

13:59.000 --> 14:00.710
Jesus, Matt!

14:04.470 --> 14:05.470
What part are you playing?

14:05.520 --> 14:07.110
Nancy.

14:07.160 --> 14:10.030
- Nancy? - Bill Sykes's girlfriend.
- Yeah, I know who she is,

14:10.080 --> 14:13.390
- I'm just a little surprised they've cast you.
- It's an all-boys' school.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.630
- It's a good role. I get to die.
- No, no, no.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.150
Proud as I am that my son
is playing the female lead,

14:18.200 --> 14:19.990
we're talking about my wedding!

14:20.040 --> 14:23.790
- It's a big thing for me.
- Well, it isn't for me. I hardly even know...

14:23.840 --> 14:27.430
Oh... Angela! You'll get to know
her when you come to the wedding.

14:27.480 --> 14:30.750
- I've flown halfway round the world
to talk to you. - You could've phoned.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.870
- That's how important you are to me.
- Why not let me do what I want?

14:33.920 --> 14:36.510
- I don't want to come to your wedding.
- Well, I don't care.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.590
- You're coming.
- I'm not and you can't make me!

14:38.640 --> 14:42.830
- How long do you think they'll let
you stay when I stop paying the
bills? - Adam! - Keep out of this.

14:42.880 --> 14:45.190
You're 15 years old.
You'll do what you're told.

14:45.240 --> 14:47.230
- Matt, stop walking away from me.
- Shut up.

14:47.280 --> 14:48.880
Shut...? What?

14:52.560 --> 14:54.630
Well, that went well (!)

14:59.240 --> 15:01.030
So he'll be there, then?

15:01.080 --> 15:03.070
Pete? No.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.750
But Matthew will, with a
face like a slapped arse

15:05.800 --> 15:08.800
reminding me how much
I've ruined his life. Kids!

15:10.920 --> 15:13.350
- See you in a couple of weeks.
- I look forward to it.

15:13.400 --> 15:15.870
I'm already working on my speech.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.000
Great.

15:21.800 --> 15:23.790
I hate goodbyes, so I'm just gonna go.

15:23.840 --> 15:25.440
Come here.

15:29.480 --> 15:31.480
Jenny, Jen-Jen.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.630
He is making a terrible mistake

15:42.680 --> 15:44.310
and he knows it.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.550
Just smile and wave.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.880
Yay!

15:50.160 --> 15:52.750
- I need a word. Do you have
time for a coffee? - Yeah.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.270
Ooh, coffee, yeah. Why not?

15:55.320 --> 15:58.060
I might even treat myself to an Irish.

15:58.600 --> 16:02.520
- Tell me about it, I won't be able
to sleep either. - Rachel! Rachel!>

16:25.680 --> 16:28.880
Stay still. I'm gonna get
some help. Stay there.

16:31.960 --> 16:34.430
David shouldn't be his best man.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.520
He isn't, he's his second-best man.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.510
Coming through. Out of the way!

16:44.560 --> 16:46.550
So, a slight hitch with the flights.

16:46.600 --> 16:48.590
Robyn wants to come after all,

16:48.640 --> 16:50.630
business-class,

16:50.680 --> 16:52.670
which uses up all my points.

16:52.720 --> 16:56.520
So I'm afraid... I'm afraid you're
going to have to pay for yourself.

16:58.640 --> 17:01.630
Oh, you're going to have to
make your own way to the airport.

17:01.680 --> 17:03.750
I'm about to be banned from driving.

17:03.800 --> 17:05.400
What?

17:07.720 --> 17:09.790
Mind your backs, please!

17:11.040 --> 17:13.790
Well, we should do this again sometime.

17:13.839 --> 17:16.270
What, meet at the airport for coffee (?)

17:16.319 --> 17:18.950
You know, get together. Come for dinner.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.589
Robyn would love that.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.640

you two go to Singapore?

So... you had a fall.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.630
I fell.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.310
Old people have falls.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.070
- Off a travelator.
- I was distracted, all right?

17:51.120 --> 17:53.110
What by?

17:53.160 --> 17:55.150
Erm...

17:55.200 --> 17:56.990
I thought you'd had a heart attack.

17:57.040 --> 17:59.550
Why would you think that?
I was wearing a neck brace.

17:59.600 --> 18:01.910
As a result of the fall,
after your heart attack.

18:01.960 --> 18:04.830
- It was an accident. They happen.
- Well, not really at airports.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.470
Mind you, we did see a
documentary about that, didn't we?

18:07.520 --> 18:10.320
What was it? When Travelators Attack (?)

18:10.380 --> 18:11.870
Oh, brilliant.

18:11.920 --> 18:13.990
- His dad's sense of
humour. Very funny. - OK.

18:14.040 --> 18:15.630
So just to get this straight, OK.

18:15.680 --> 18:18.070
You didn't have a heart attack.

18:18.120 --> 18:21.270
- Concussion. They're just keeping
me in to run a few tests. - Right.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.630
- I'd better let Angela know --
- You haven't let...

18:23.680 --> 18:26.590
- That's what I asked you to do.
- .. that it wasn't a heart attack.

18:26.640 --> 18:29.910
- You told her I had a heart attack?
- It seemed the logical explanation.

18:29.960 --> 18:32.870
- You know, a man of your age.
- She'll be sat at home, worried sick.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.230
Well, that is where you're wrong,

18:35.280 --> 18:39.590
because she is on a plane
right now to Manchester.

18:39.640 --> 18:42.110
- What?
- Oh, good.

18:42.160 --> 18:44.760
I didn't think we'd get to meet her.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.440
Wh...? Whoa. Wait. Er...

18:52.980 --> 18:54.770
No, of course I don't mind.

18:54.820 --> 18:57.920
I'd ask Pete or Jen, but
they're both working.

18:58.340 --> 19:01.170
- She could get a cab, I suppose.
- Adam, as your best man,

19:01.220 --> 19:02.850
I can't allow that.

19:02.900 --> 19:04.530
Now...

19:04.580 --> 19:07.610
- How do you spell her surname?
- Thanks.

19:07.660 --> 19:11.170
- Z... - Yeah? - .. U-B... - Uh-huh.

19:11.220 --> 19:12.820
.. A-Y-R.

19:13.900 --> 19:15.490
Right.

19:15.540 --> 19:18.580

Wha...? Who...?

20:03.860 --> 20:06.130
Oh, my God. I thought you were dead!

20:06.180 --> 20:08.050
No, no, no, I'm not dead.

20:08.100 --> 20:11.090
- So it wasn't a heart attack?
- No, no, it was just, er...

20:11.140 --> 20:13.480
- A bump on the head.
- A...

20:14.980 --> 20:16.970
You spoke to Pete.

20:17.020 --> 20:19.560
You're very funny. Come here, you.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.330
Hello.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.460
- Come on. Mm.
- Mm.

20:25.060 --> 20:26.770
Did David not come in with you?

20:26.820 --> 20:29.940
- David? - My friend, he
picked you up at the airport.

20:31.100 --> 20:33.810
Angela mistook me for her driver!

20:33.860 --> 20:36.690
Chauffeur, you were better-dressed.

20:36.740 --> 20:39.370
Funnily enough, that
happened to me the other day.

20:39.420 --> 20:41.050
Happens to me all the time.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.090
Trouble is, it's true.

20:43.140 --> 20:45.650
Gives you an anecdote for your speech, eh?

20:45.700 --> 20:48.900
I wouldn't do that. Not
at the bride's expense.

20:51.820 --> 20:53.810
I'm just going to check on the food.

20:53.860 --> 20:56.400
- I'll give you a hand.
- Thanks.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.620
She is lovely.

21:01.660 --> 21:05.450
David, er, you must have
plenty of air miles, eh?

21:05.500 --> 21:08.610
Yes, enough for two business-class
flights to Singapore. Why?

21:08.660 --> 21:10.490
Can I have a word?

21:12.180 --> 21:15.330
- Well, she seems really nice.
- Well, she seems really nice!

21:15.380 --> 21:18.770
- Of course she is. She wants to make
a good impression. - She has on Adam.

21:18.820 --> 21:22.010
- He's in love. - I have to admit,
I'm falling a little bit myself.

21:22.060 --> 21:24.530
Aw! Sad, middle-aged man.

21:24.580 --> 21:28.330
- Him and you. - He's happy,
Jen. - Why wouldn't he be?

21:28.380 --> 21:31.970
Oh... Erm, she's 18
years younger than him.

21:32.020 --> 21:34.410
That's my point.

21:34.460 --> 21:37.850
- He's making a fool of himself.
- Oh, will you just leave him be?

21:37.900 --> 21:39.930
He is old enough to make his own mistakes.

The place that we're going to be living
in is in this great part of Singapore.

24:38.820 --> 24:42.020
And your room, when you
come and visit is, er...

24:42.220 --> 24:45.370
I guess it must be a bit odd
for you: me and your dad.

24:45.420 --> 24:48.010
- No, a lot of the boys
have stepmums. - Oh, yeah?

24:48.060 --> 24:50.250
- Do they get on with them?
- No.

24:50.300 --> 24:52.690
Well, I hope we will.

24:52.740 --> 24:54.810
Erm, you're a bit different.

24:54.860 --> 24:56.930
You mean I'm not trying
to replace your mum?

24:56.980 --> 24:59.330
I think he means you're
a lot younger than them.

24:59.380 --> 25:01.450
One of the boys thought
you were the au pair.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.890
Is that a good thing?

25:03.940 --> 25:05.930
- Yeah, au pairs are hot.
- Oi!

25:05.980 --> 25:07.920
You little bollocks.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.010
You are in big trouble, Matthew.

25:11.060 --> 25:13.850
- It's nothing. The school are
being stupid. - Dealing drugs?

25:13.900 --> 25:15.810
- Nos. It's not illegal.
- Laughing gas?

25:15.860 --> 25:17.850
All the kids are doing it. It's harmless.

25:17.900 --> 25:20.100
People have died, Matthew!

25:23.700 --> 25:25.900
Karen said you'd kick off.

25:26.460 --> 25:29.370
- You knew about this?
- I am the school's first point of contact.

25:29.420 --> 25:32.650
- You didn't think to tell me?
- It didn't seem worth bothering you with.

25:32.700 --> 25:35.810
- He's threatened with expulsion!
- It's not that big a big deal, is it?

25:35.860 --> 25:39.330
- What?! - Come on. When you were
young, you didn't do any laughing gas?

25:39.380 --> 25:41.250
- Worse.
- Me too.

25:42.100 --> 25:44.090
He's threatened with expulsion!

25:44.140 --> 25:46.850
- If he does it again.
- So you won't, will you?

25:46.900 --> 25:49.700
- No.
- There you go. Problem sorted.

25:50.740 --> 25:54.020
- I thought parenting would be a lot harder.
- Well, it can be.

25:59.380 --> 26:01.380
Sorry.

26:06.980 --> 26:08.970
Are you still annoyed with me?

26:09.020 --> 26:11.020
I'm trying to be.

26:14.820 --> 26:18.220
Karen told me that Matt doesn't
want to come to our wedding.

26:19.260 --> 26:22.560
- Not because of you.
- And Pete and Jenny can't.

26:22.620 --> 26:23.940
No.

26:27.420 --> 26:30.410
- I don't think we should get married --
- What? - .. in Singapore.

26:30.460 --> 26:33.490
Your friends have to be there and
your son's got to want to be there.

26:33.540 --> 26:35.130
If they won't come to the wedding,

26:35.180 --> 26:37.980
then... let's bring the wedding to them.

26:38.460 --> 26:40.730
Have it here, in Manchester?

26:42.060 --> 26:44.850
- What about your friends?
- Oh, they'll come, don't worry.

26:44.900 --> 26:46.970
Any excuse for a party.

26:48.060 --> 26:50.660
You are wonderful, do you know that?

26:51.100 --> 26:53.500
It doesn't hurt to be reminded.

27:10.780 --> 27:14.530
Your moving the wedding back home
has saved me a fortune in air fares.

27:14.580 --> 27:16.650
Literally why we did it, David.

27:16.700 --> 27:19.370
Must have cost you though,
all those lost deposits.

27:19.420 --> 27:21.970
Angela's dad's paying.
Small change to him.

27:22.020 --> 27:24.610
- His name's not Eddie, is it?
- Yeah. Do you know him?

27:24.660 --> 27:27.530
There must be more than one
Eddie Zubayr in the world.

27:27.580 --> 27:29.770
Not worth 300 million quid, there aren't.

27:29.820 --> 27:31.810
What, that's him?

27:31.860 --> 27:33.850
What, that is him?

27:33.900 --> 27:35.900
Yeah.

27:36.980 --> 27:38.980
I'll get these.

27:40.980 --> 27:43.930
Bit of luck, then, your
accident at the airport?

27:43.980 --> 27:45.650
How do you mean?

27:45.700 --> 27:48.370
- It means we can all go to the wedding.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

27:48.420 --> 27:50.690
Yeah, I suppose that's true.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.500
You can keep a secret?

27:54.540 --> 27:58.330
- I can start.
- The reason the accident happened,

27:58.380 --> 28:00.650
er, I was at the airport.

28:00.700 --> 28:03.040
Someone shouted out, "Rachel!"

28:05.060 --> 28:07.060
And then I saw her.

28:08.420 --> 28:10.050
- Who?
- Rachel.

28:10.100 --> 28:12.450
- Rachel?
- Someone that looked like her.

28:12.500 --> 28:15.730
I mean, it stopped me in my
tracks and the next thing I know,

28:15.780 --> 28:18.650
I'm getting mouth-to-mouth from
a paramedic with halitosis.

28:18.700 --> 28:21.170
Well, this is like the old times.

28:21.860 --> 28:24.460
The three amigos back in the saddle.

28:25.860 --> 28:27.860
Three amigos.

28:30.140 --> 28:33.130
- So, Eddie Zubayr!
- Yeah.

28:33.180 --> 28:35.690
- Well, will he be coming
over for the wedding? - Yeah.

28:35.740 --> 28:39.810
- He's arriving next week. He's got
some deal he's working on. - Really?

28:39.860 --> 28:42.650
Oh. Well, perhaps I should
meet him at the airport.

28:42.700 --> 28:45.410
- What, as a business opportunity?
- I suppose it could be,

28:45.460 --> 28:48.000
but I meant more as your best man.

28:49.740 --> 28:52.060
David, erm, on that...

28:53.860 --> 28:56.460
Since the wedding's gonna be here...

28:57.020 --> 28:59.010
.. do you mind if I reinstate Pete?

28:59.060 --> 29:01.060
Pete?

29:03.740 --> 29:06.060
No, no, of course not, no.

29:07.180 --> 29:09.650
I was going to suggest it myself.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.610
Three amigos.

29:16.660 --> 29:19.130
- Three amigos.
- Three amigos.

29:24.380 --> 29:25.970
Oh, all right, love.

29:26.020 --> 29:28.010
- Hiya.
- Listen, er...

29:28.060 --> 29:30.450
- Any chance of extending my stay?
- Manchester?

29:30.500 --> 29:32.500
This time of year?

29:33.700 --> 29:35.930
Yeah. All right. How long
for? A couple of days?

29:35.980 --> 29:37.690
Er, maybe a few weeks.

29:37.740 --> 29:39.530
- There's been a change of plan. - Mm.

29:39.580 --> 29:41.580
You're looking well.

29:44.820 --> 29:46.160
David...

29:46.860 --> 29:48.850
.. I've parked in short-stay.

29:48.900 --> 29:51.900
Good. You can pick your
car up later. Here.

29:52.260 --> 29:54.570
- Oh, I'm not dressing up.
- Oh, Pete, please.

29:54.620 --> 29:57.090
I was gonna fly you to Singapore.

29:57.380 --> 30:00.120
I stood down so you could be best man.

30:01.220 --> 30:03.220
(All right.)

30:04.700 --> 30:06.340
Here.

30:07.860 --> 30:09.860
Ah, here he is.

30:11.900 --> 30:13.290
Ah.

30:15.460 --> 30:17.530
Welcome to Manchester.

30:17.580 --> 30:21.450
Mr Marsden, your knowledge of
Islamic customs is exemplary.

30:21.500 --> 30:24.820
And I must confess, completely exhausted.

30:25.940 --> 30:28.860
Let me take this. The car is this way.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.610
So, how was your flight?

30:40.300 --> 30:42.290
So what do you think?

30:42.340 --> 30:45.210
- That you shouldn't be getting married.
- Oh, shut up.

30:45.260 --> 30:48.650
- Here, look. - Needs to be tighter in
the back. - Tighter in the back. - Mm.

30:48.700 --> 30:51.300
I just don't understand why you are.

30:51.820 --> 30:54.820
Because Angela's only
got six months to live.

30:55.380 --> 30:57.370
Oh, my God!

30:57.420 --> 30:59.810
That's not true, I just
said it to shut you up.

30:59.860 --> 31:02.850
- Adam, seriously!
- Oi, what? Jen!

31:02.900 --> 31:07.530
- Do you remember what it's like to
fall in love, eh? - Well, vaguely.

31:07.580 --> 31:10.610
You know, the agony when he doesn't
call, the ecstasy when he does.

31:10.660 --> 31:13.170
- Sorry, is this Pete we're
talking about? - Oh, yeah.

31:13.220 --> 31:15.890
Well, that's what it's
like for me with Ange.

31:15.940 --> 31:19.770
That's cos it's early days, you
know, the first flush of romance.

31:19.820 --> 31:22.130
You don't get married off that.

31:22.180 --> 31:26.250
You wait till it's passed and then see if
you can still stand the sight of each other.

31:26.300 --> 31:28.090
Well, we can. Sorry.

31:28.140 --> 31:30.850
And as daft as it sounds,
she makes me feel --

31:30.900 --> 31:33.170
- Like dancing (!)
- No, alive.

31:33.220 --> 31:35.210
That's not gonna change. It's who she is.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.250
She's constantly surprising.

31:37.300 --> 31:41.140
We had this argument in Singapore
about the best restaurant to eat in.

31:42.180 --> 31:44.370
I guarantee you won't
have tasted better food.

31:44.420 --> 31:46.570
I know where you're taking
me and you're right.

31:46.620 --> 31:49.410
- You won't know this one.
- Listen, I've lived here three years.

31:49.460 --> 31:52.370
I know everywhere. Even
places that haven't opened.

31:52.420 --> 31:55.130
And this, this is my favourite.

31:55.180 --> 31:57.170
This way.

32:06.020 --> 32:08.010
What? What is that?

32:08.060 --> 32:10.000
I thought that was...

32:12.380 --> 32:14.380
Oh, I love you.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.290
I love you too.

32:18.340 --> 32:20.540
Let's get married.

32:23.180 --> 32:26.090
And when she said that, I didn't
think, "Well, that's mental!"

32:26.140 --> 32:28.650
- I just said, "Yes!"
- Except it is mental.

32:28.700 --> 32:32.770
Maybe it will work, maybe it won't
but, while it does, I'll feel alive

32:32.820 --> 32:35.530
and after Rachel, I never
thought I would again.

32:35.580 --> 32:38.180
I know you're having doubts.

32:39.220 --> 32:41.130
What?

32:41.180 --> 32:43.370
I...

32:43.420 --> 32:45.890
I know what put Adam in hospital.

32:47.220 --> 32:49.410
- I'll kill him. I will kill him.
- You saw Rachel.

32:49.460 --> 32:51.450
No, I saw someone that looked like Rachel.

32:51.500 --> 32:55.090
- Happen often, does it? - All the time in
the first couple of years after she died.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.650
- Since then? - Not once in
the last ten years, but --

32:57.700 --> 32:59.810
You see, you know deep inside

32:59.860 --> 33:02.650
that Rachel wouldn't give
this marriage her blessing.

33:02.700 --> 33:05.130
- It was an accident. - There
is no such thing. - What?

33:05.180 --> 33:07.530
- It's your subconscious
and you know it. - Stop it.

33:07.580 --> 33:09.410
That's why you didn't want Pete to blab.

33:09.460 --> 33:12.730
Except, subconsciously you did, cos
you wanted me to talk you out of it.

33:12.780 --> 33:15.530
- Jen, what is your problem?
- I just think you're gonna get hurt

33:15.580 --> 33:18.780
and I don't want to ever
see that happen again cos...

33:20.700 --> 33:22.970
.. cos I care about you, OK.

33:24.380 --> 33:26.380
A lot.

33:33.380 --> 33:35.520
- I love you, Jen.
- Hm!

33:38.140 --> 33:40.140
And I love Angela.

33:47.980 --> 33:49.980
Where's he gone?

34:05.160 --> 34:07.150
Drink up, we're leaving.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.199
Eh?

34:14.719 --> 34:16.310
I thought you'd enjoy it.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.949
What, some hot, young babe
rubbing her tits in my face?

34:19.000 --> 34:22.190
- Well, it's only what you're
used to at home. - Oi, oi, oi!

34:22.239 --> 34:25.830
I'm sorry, I just want to give you
a stag night you'll never forget.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.389
- Yeah, well, so far, it's been shite.
- Oh, great (!)

34:28.440 --> 34:31.030
Well, I'll... All right,
I'll think of something else.

34:31.080 --> 34:33.909
Hang on. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
What night of the week is it?

34:33.960 --> 34:35.590
- Thursday. - Thursday. - Thursday.

34:35.639 --> 34:39.750
- I know this pub where women wrestle
each other naked in jelly. - No, no.

34:39.800 --> 34:43.070
Why does everything have to involve
women taking off their clothes?

34:43.120 --> 34:46.590
- It's his stag night. - Yeah, but it
just all feels a bit... - A bit sordid.

34:46.639 --> 34:49.260
- I mean, look at us. - Yeah, it was
all right when we were their age.

34:49.310 --> 34:52.590
- But not now...
- I know what, let's go for a Chinese.

34:53.040 --> 34:54.670
If you can say that nowadays.

34:54.719 --> 34:57.510
David, with the greatest respect,
that is a crap stag night.

34:57.560 --> 34:59.870
Yeah but, you know, that's
the stag night I want.

34:59.920 --> 35:02.830
- A few pints with my old mates.
- Yeah, you know, the three amigos.

35:02.880 --> 35:05.080
The three amigos. Come on.

35:15.680 --> 35:17.270
Matthew.

35:17.320 --> 35:19.390
What are you doing here?

35:20.640 --> 35:22.950
Does Angela earn more than you?

35:23.000 --> 35:26.390
I mean, biomedical engineering,
it must be really well paid.

35:26.440 --> 35:30.590
It is and she does by a small
margin and I'm OK with it.

35:30.640 --> 35:32.230
I'm not sure I would be.

35:32.280 --> 35:33.950
I have to be.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.590
Was it Dorothy Parker who said,

35:35.640 --> 35:38.990
"I've been rich, I've been poor
and believe me, rich is better"?

35:40.040 --> 35:41.240
God!

35:42.840 --> 35:46.230
- I can't stand it.
- What, when David quotes Dorothy Parker?

35:46.280 --> 35:48.550
Yes, David, what were you thinking?

35:48.600 --> 35:50.190
No, being poor.

35:50.240 --> 35:53.630
Having to work two jobs and then
expect Jenny to make ends meet.

35:53.680 --> 35:56.390
I feel like a failure.

35:56.440 --> 36:00.590
You're not a failure, mate, you're
just going through a rough patch.

36:00.640 --> 36:03.030
- Yeah, you'll get back on your feet.
- I'm almost 50.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.070
This is not gonna get any better.

36:05.120 --> 36:08.310
- Do you know, I envy you?
- Piss off! - Yeah, I do.

36:08.360 --> 36:10.150
Your relationship with Jenny.

36:10.200 --> 36:13.070
Through thick and thin, you stuck it out.

36:13.560 --> 36:15.550
Robyn...

36:15.600 --> 36:17.940
Robyn doesn't even like me...

36:20.200 --> 36:23.200
.. and I'm not sure I
particularly like her.

36:28.200 --> 36:31.270
Well, I mean, you know, I envy
your relationship with your kids.

36:31.320 --> 36:33.910
Chloe doesn't even know I'm not her dad.

36:33.960 --> 36:36.430
She loves you, Pete. So does Adam.

36:36.480 --> 36:39.350
I wish I had that closeness with Matthew.

36:39.520 --> 36:41.520
I am not happy.

36:44.640 --> 36:47.430
I have moments, you know,
but that's all they are.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.680
Little, fleeting glimpses.

36:50.960 --> 36:56.280
Maybe... Maybe in middle age,
that's the best we can hope for.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.270
It's just...

37:01.320 --> 37:03.960
I miss my future being ahead of me.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.400
I miss Karen.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.260
I'm getting married tomorrow.

Great stag go, Pete.

37:17.160 --> 37:18.870
You're welcome.

37:25.040 --> 37:28.830
- Listen, we're gonna
talk to your dad, OK? - No.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.790
- No, no, no, he can't know.
- No, Matt, he has to know.

37:31.840 --> 37:34.350
No, you can't tell him. Not now, please.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.390
Karen, please.

37:36.440 --> 37:38.580
You've got to promise me.

37:46.520 --> 37:49.430
Well, that was very kind.
You didn't need to do that.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.070
I wasn't sure what to get.

37:51.120 --> 37:53.230
I realised I don't know Angela very well.

37:53.280 --> 37:55.750
Then I thought, "Neither do you."

37:58.200 --> 37:59.790
Everything all right?

37:59.840 --> 38:02.110
Yeah, yeah, fine. I'm...

- No.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.150
Oh.

38:23.200 --> 38:25.710
Cos I wonder whether all
of this is a bad idea.

38:25.760 --> 38:29.630
- One of my closest friends thinks it
is. - Friends often know best. - Hm.

38:29.680 --> 38:31.750
As often as they don't.

38:34.640 --> 38:36.630
When the time comes, you'll know.
