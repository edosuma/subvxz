WEBVTT

00:42.801 --> 00:45.065
Some say juvenile.

00:45.137 --> 00:47.799
I say genius!

00:58.984 --> 01:00.884
Leave me alone!

01:02.154 --> 01:04.714
Matt, I'm getting ready
for graduation!

01:06.792 --> 01:08.316
Matt!

01:13.532 --> 01:16.660
Say goodbye
to your little toy.

01:16.735 --> 01:21.331
And say hello to Matt owning
his big sister for eternity!

01:23.075 --> 01:25.339
Never give up

01:25.411 --> 01:27.743
Yeah, yeah

01:27.813 --> 01:30.577
Never give up

01:30.649 --> 01:35.245
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

01:35.321 --> 01:40.349
I'm gonna be
your number one

01:40.426 --> 01:42.291
I'm not the kind of girl

01:42.361 --> 01:46.320
Who gives up
just like that

01:46.398 --> 01:49.196
Oh, no

01:49.268 --> 01:53.864
It's not the things you do
that tease and hurt me bad

01:53.939 --> 01:58.433
But it's the way you do
the things you do to me

01:58.510 --> 02:00.876
I'm not the kind of girl

02:00.946 --> 02:04.939
Who gives up
just like that

02:05.017 --> 02:07.679
Oh, no

02:07.753 --> 02:12.622
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

02:12.691 --> 02:16.718
I'm gonna be
your number one

02:16.795 --> 02:21.289
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

02:21.367 --> 02:24.859
I'm gonna be
your number one

02:24.937 --> 02:26.165
Ooh

02:26.238 --> 02:29.230
Number one

02:29.308 --> 02:30.969
Number one

02:31.043 --> 02:34.206
Number one

02:34.279 --> 02:35.610
Number one

02:35.681 --> 02:39.617
Every girl wants you
to be her man

02:39.685 --> 02:44.952
But I'll wait right here
till it's my turn

02:45.024 --> 02:46.787
I'm not the kind of girl

02:46.892 --> 02:50.760
Who gives up
just like that

02:50.829 --> 02:53.559
Oh, no

02:53.632 --> 02:58.433
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

02:58.504 --> 03:03.100
I'm gonna be
your number one

03:03.175 --> 03:07.839
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

03:07.913 --> 03:12.350
I'm gonna be
your number one

03:12.418 --> 03:15.546
Number one

03:15.621 --> 03:17.054
Number one

03:17.122 --> 03:20.853
Number one

03:20.926 --> 03:21.915
Gotta hold on

03:21.994 --> 03:24.155
Every time
that I get the feeling

03:24.229 --> 03:26.527
You give me something
to believe in

03:26.598 --> 03:28.725
Every time
that I got you near me

03:28.801 --> 03:30.962
I know the way
that I want it to be

03:31.036 --> 03:33.664
But you know
I'm gonna take my chance now

03:33.739 --> 03:35.764
I'm gonna make it happen
somehow

03:35.841 --> 03:37.866
And you know
I can take the pressure

03:37.943 --> 03:40.411
A moment's pain
for a lifetime of pleasure

03:40.479 --> 03:42.538
Pleasure, pleasure,
pleasure...

03:42.614 --> 03:47.017
Every girl wants you
to be her man

03:47.086 --> 03:51.716
But I'll wait right here
till it's my turn

03:51.790 --> 03:53.815
I'm not the kind of girl

03:53.926 --> 03:58.056
Who gives up
just like that

03:58.130 --> 04:00.621
Oh, no

04:00.699 --> 04:05.659
The tide is high,
but I'm holding on

04:05.737 --> 04:10.003
I'm gonna be
your number one

04:10.075 --> 04:11.940
The tide is high

04:12.010 --> 04:14.501
But I'm holding on

04:14.580 --> 04:18.243
I'm gonna be
your number one

04:18.317 --> 04:19.249
Whoa!

04:19.317 --> 04:21.911
Every time
that I get the feeling

04:21.987 --> 04:24.148
You give me something
to believe in

04:24.223 --> 04:26.487
Every time
that I got you near me

04:26.558 --> 04:28.788
I know the way
that I want it to be

04:28.861 --> 04:31.386
But you know
I'm gonna take my chance now

04:31.463 --> 04:33.590
I'm gonna make it happen
somehow

04:33.665 --> 04:35.860
And you know
I can take the pressure

04:35.934 --> 04:38.334
A moment's pain
for a lifetime of pleasure

04:38.403 --> 04:39.665
The tide is high...

04:39.738 --> 04:43.105
I shall win the Academy Award!

04:44.343 --> 04:46.208
Yesterday, you were in diapers,

04:46.278 --> 04:48.712
and now you're graduating
junior high.

04:48.780 --> 04:51.908
You're growing up, and I can't
believe you're going to Rome

04:51.984 --> 04:54.179
for two weeks
all by yourself.

04:54.253 --> 04:58.053
Without me.
Without me there with you.

04:58.123 --> 04:59.750
Without me with you there.

04:59.825 --> 05:01.087
You there without me.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.560
Mom, that's about
all the combinations

05:03.629 --> 05:05.256
of those words you can make.

05:05.330 --> 05:08.390
Lizzie, this is a big day
for you, sweetheart.

05:08.467 --> 05:10.628
He's going to quote a dead guy.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.403
As William Shakespeare wrote,
"Be not afraid of greatness:

05:15.474 --> 05:18.034
some are born great,
some achieve greatness,

05:18.110 --> 05:20.544
and some have greatness
thrust upon them."

05:20.612 --> 05:23.775
Thanks, Dad, but I'm just trying
to get through graduation.

05:23.849 --> 05:26.409
Greatness can wait
till this nightmare's over.

05:26.485 --> 05:27.577
Hey, Gordo.

05:27.653 --> 05:29.382
So, do I look okay?

05:29.454 --> 05:30.853
I'm your guy best friend.

05:30.923 --> 05:33.153
You should talk to Miranda
about this.

05:33.225 --> 05:35.056
But she's in Mexico City.

05:35.127 --> 05:38.290
Yes. Your blue robe
looks way cooler

05:38.363 --> 05:40.160
than all the other girls'.

05:40.232 --> 05:41.893
Oh...my...God.

05:41.967 --> 05:45.698
Only you would think
you could hide that powder- blue,

05:45.771 --> 05:47.329
puffy-sleeved,
it's-kind-of-a-peasant-dress-

05:47.406 --> 05:49.806
but-it-might-just-be-
a-baggy- disaster

05:49.875 --> 05:51.900
that you wore
to the spring dance.

05:53.178 --> 05:56.147
Lizzie McGuire, you are
an outfit repeater!

05:58.483 --> 06:00.678
But I...

06:00.752 --> 06:02.447
Maybe I'm an outfit repeater,

06:02.521 --> 06:04.284
but you're
an outfit rememberer,

06:04.356 --> 06:06.324
which is just as pathetic.

06:06.391 --> 06:09.019
Does she not have
anything better to do

06:09.094 --> 06:10.891
than make my life miserable?

06:10.963 --> 06:14.126
I mean...
we used to be best friends.

06:14.199 --> 06:16.531
But that was before
she became popular.

06:16.602 --> 06:18.365
McGuire!

06:18.437 --> 06:20.337
Go.

06:20.405 --> 06:21.929
Hey, Mr. Escobar.

06:24.009 --> 06:25.840
Nice after-shave.

06:25.911 --> 06:27.139
Oh, thank you.

06:27.212 --> 06:30.045
Margaret Chan either has ebola
or a very bad cold.

06:30.115 --> 06:31.548
In any event, you're up.

06:31.617 --> 06:33.050
U-U-Up where?

06:33.118 --> 06:34.676
At the podium.

06:34.753 --> 06:37.813
You are going to deliver
the class president's speech.

06:37.889 --> 06:39.982
B-But what about
the vice president?

06:40.058 --> 06:41.252
He's not graduating.

06:41.326 --> 06:43.453
The secretary treasurer's
next in line.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.359
All I did was handle petty cash.

06:45.430 --> 06:48.490
I'm sorry, but you're not
buying your way out of this.

06:48.567 --> 06:50.535
I want you to deliver
your speech

06:50.602 --> 06:52.570
with as much pride
and commitment

06:52.638 --> 06:54.071
as Margaret Chan would,

06:54.139 --> 06:56.266
even though
you're no Margaret Chan.

07:02.814 --> 07:05.248
You're no Margaret Chan.

07:05.317 --> 07:07.683
You're no Margaret Chan.

07:07.753 --> 07:09.118
You're no Margaret Chan.

07:09.187 --> 07:10.779
Run!

07:13.659 --> 07:16.594
Ladies and gentlemen,
uh, Lizzie McGuire.

07:27.105 --> 07:28.970
Um...

07:29.041 --> 07:31.771
U-Uh, Margaret Chan
couldn't make it tonight,

07:31.843 --> 07:36.007
so I'm going - I'm going to
be filling in for her.

07:37.749 --> 07:40.081
Not that any of us
could really do that,

07:40.152 --> 07:42.245
but, um, anyway...

07:42.321 --> 07:45.313
Honey, I'm losing the feeling
in my knuckles.

07:45.390 --> 07:48.416
I think that we can all agree
that junior high

07:48.493 --> 07:51.155
is filled with
embarrassing and awkward

07:51.229 --> 07:55.723
and sometimes just downright
humiliating moments, right?

07:58.437 --> 08:00.029
Uh...

08:00.105 --> 08:02.539
Oh!
Me neither.

08:02.607 --> 08:04.802
It is so sad.

08:05.911 --> 08:06.935
Wow.

08:07.012 --> 08:09.173
It's like watching one
of those animals

08:09.247 --> 08:11.238
get killed
on the Discovery Channel.

08:16.221 --> 08:18.121
I-I think Margaret Chan

08:18.190 --> 08:21.318
would want me to have
some water right now.

08:22.894 --> 08:23.883
Uhh! Oh!

08:34.373 --> 08:36.169
Play something!
Do something!

08:40.511 --> 08:41.638
Yes! Ha ha ha!

08:41.746 --> 08:43.236
Come on! Mom! Dad!

08:43.313 --> 08:45.248
I've got to get out
of the country!

08:45.316 --> 08:48.149
I know you're still upset,
but it wasn't that bad.

08:48.219 --> 08:49.550
Oh, really, Mom?

08:49.620 --> 08:53.351
Was your junior-high graduation
on "Good Morning America"?

08:53.424 --> 08:56.086
What creep would send
Diane Sawyer a video

08:56.160 --> 08:57.821
to embarrass you like that?

08:57.895 --> 08:58.919
Oh.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.899
- Ugh!

09:07.972 --> 09:10.668
What is that?

09:10.741 --> 09:13.005
That is Miss Ungermeyer.

09:13.077 --> 09:15.341
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hey!

09:15.412 --> 09:18.438
She's gonna be our principal
for the next four years.

09:18.516 --> 09:20.074
If you stay on her good side,

09:20.151 --> 09:22.745
it's a one-way ticket
to an lvy League school.

09:22.820 --> 09:24.583
What if you're on her bad side?

09:24.655 --> 09:27.522
Excuse me!
I need to mop up some puke.

09:27.591 --> 09:28.819
Well, you...

09:28.893 --> 09:31.157
You wind up as that guy?

09:31.228 --> 09:34.527
No. You end up working
for that guy.

09:34.598 --> 09:37.658
Can you make sure there are
no garlic or soy products

09:37.735 --> 09:39.396
in anything Brittany
puts near her mouth?

09:39.470 --> 09:41.631
Miss Ungermeyer,
Luke has tennis elbow.

09:41.705 --> 09:43.536
Could somebody
carry his luggage?

09:43.607 --> 09:46.508
My son has asthma,
and he must have his puffer.

09:46.577 --> 09:48.545
Brittany, she's got allergies.

09:50.447 --> 09:52.244
Attention, parents...

09:52.316 --> 09:54.250
shut your pie holes.

09:54.318 --> 09:57.651
I'm on a mission here
to drag your progeny

09:57.721 --> 10:01.350
to 31 historically significant
Roman landmarks

10:01.425 --> 10:03.518
in two weeks.

10:03.594 --> 10:07.223
Now, when these back-talking
miscreants return to you,

10:07.298 --> 10:11.098
they will have dipped their
toes in a lake of culture,

10:11.168 --> 10:12.829
before assuming their destiny

10:12.903 --> 10:14.996
folding shirts
at the outlet mall.

10:15.072 --> 10:18.701
Many - actually, most -
of your classmates opted

10:18.776 --> 10:22.610
for the 36-hour bus ride
to the Water-slide Wonderland.

10:22.680 --> 10:23.942
Whoo!

10:24.014 --> 10:25.709
But you...

10:25.783 --> 10:29.844
you, who are not
mouth- breathing trailer trash,

10:29.920 --> 10:33.412
you will get to experience
the delights

10:33.490 --> 10:36.516
of la citta eterna!

10:36.594 --> 10:37.856
Hmm-hmm.

10:39.530 --> 10:41.293
Rome. The eternal city.

10:41.365 --> 10:43.424
Did no one read
the info packets?

10:46.103 --> 10:47.900
Watch and learn.

10:49.306 --> 10:50.796
Um, Miss Ungermeyer,

10:50.875 --> 10:54.208
I just wanted to let you know
I'm really looking forward

10:54.278 --> 10:57.247
to this exciting
and academically enriching trip.

10:57.314 --> 10:58.281
What's your name?

10:58.349 --> 10:59.338
David Gordon.

10:59.416 --> 11:00.974
- David Gordon.
- Mm-hmm.

11:01.051 --> 11:02.643
I think, in ltalian,

11:02.720 --> 11:06.281
that means a sneaky brownnoser
with a hidden agenda, huh?

11:06.357 --> 11:07.790
Uh, uh.

11:07.858 --> 11:09.917
Yeah! Come on,
check those bags!

11:09.994 --> 11:12.155
I want to see that junk
in the trunk

11:12.229 --> 11:13.594
and a seat looking neat.

11:17.001 --> 11:18.992
Okay.

11:22.840 --> 11:24.000
Mom...

11:25.376 --> 11:28.209
Okay, it's only
two weeks, Mom.

11:29.813 --> 11:32.145
- Honey, she's got to go.
- Two weeks.

11:35.386 --> 11:36.819
- Bye, sweetie.
- Bye.

11:36.887 --> 11:38.787
- Safe trip, huh?
- Okay.

12:12.222 --> 12:13.951
Sweetheart...

12:16.927 --> 12:18.918
- Okay?
- Mm-hmm.

12:24.401 --> 12:25.993
Flight 72 to Rome.

12:26.070 --> 12:28.095
Final boarding,
Flight 72 to Rome.

12:28.172 --> 12:32.006
Hey! We're going to the land
where they invented spaghetti!

12:32.076 --> 12:33.805
Ah heh.

12:33.877 --> 12:35.469
Yeah, and the best part is

12:35.546 --> 12:38.140
Kate and all the little
teeth- whitening friends

12:38.215 --> 12:40.809
who'd be ragging on me
for messing up graduation

12:40.884 --> 12:42.476
went to Water-slide Wonderland.

12:42.553 --> 12:45.579
How many Lizzies does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

12:45.656 --> 12:49.092
I don't know, but it only takes
one to screw up a graduation.

13:05.743 --> 13:08.109
Hey. Zip it.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.780
Whoa!

13:16.854 --> 13:17.912
Whoa!

14:03.967 --> 14:08.131
Down each avenue or via,
street or strata

14:08.205 --> 14:14.007
You can see 'em disappearing
two by two

14:14.078 --> 14:17.878
On an evening in Roma

14:17.948 --> 14:20.178
Do they take 'em
for espresso?

14:20.250 --> 14:21.911
Yeah, I guess so

14:21.985 --> 14:27.582
On each lover's arm,
a girl I wish I knew

14:27.658 --> 14:31.526
On an evening in Roma

14:31.595 --> 14:35.531
So please meet me
in the plaza near your casa

14:35.599 --> 14:41.196
I am only one,
and that is one too few

14:41.271 --> 14:44.934
On an evening in Roma

14:45.008 --> 14:48.500
Don't know what
the country's coming to

14:48.579 --> 14:51.605
But in Rome,
do as the Romans do

14:51.682 --> 14:54.378
Will you?

14:54.451 --> 14:57.818
- On an evening in Roma

15:02.426 --> 15:03.950
Here we are.
Step right up.

15:04.027 --> 15:06.120
Number one...
Number two...

15:06.196 --> 15:07.543
Welcome to the Hotel Cambini.

15:07.544 --> 15:08.891
Welcome to the Hotel Cambini.

15:08.966 --> 15:12.026
Lest you think there are many
of you and less of me

15:12.102 --> 15:15.538
and it will therefore be easy
to pull anything over on me,

15:15.606 --> 15:16.630
think again.

15:16.707 --> 15:18.641
In addition to being
smarter, faster,

15:18.709 --> 15:20.574
and better-looking
than most of you,

15:20.644 --> 15:22.441
I've also enlisted
a little help.

15:22.513 --> 15:25.914
The assistant manager
of the hotel, Giorgio Averni,

15:25.983 --> 15:28.042
was a commander
in the ltalian Navy

15:28.118 --> 15:31.554
and is therefore
as up on his game as I am mine.

15:31.622 --> 15:34.113
Giorgio, would you like
to brief my students

15:34.191 --> 15:36.557
on the security procedures
of the hotel?

15:36.627 --> 15:40.085
We serve at 5:00.

15:40.164 --> 15:41.859
The cookies.

15:43.500 --> 15:45.263
Yeah.

15:45.336 --> 15:47.600
You heard the man.

15:47.671 --> 15:49.104
Room assignments.

15:49.173 --> 15:50.697
David Gordon...

15:50.774 --> 15:53.265
you will be rooming
with Ethan Craft.

15:53.344 --> 15:55.107
You'll be in Room 103.

15:55.179 --> 15:57.272
Are those English
or ltalian numbers?

15:57.348 --> 15:58.940
You got a problem with that?

15:59.016 --> 16:00.415
Um, no, ma'am.

16:00.484 --> 16:02.748
Any room is just -
just fine for me.

16:02.820 --> 16:04.412
Being a spineless jellyfish

16:04.488 --> 16:07.753
is almost as unattractive
as being a little brownnoser.

16:09.860 --> 16:11.088
McGuire!

16:11.161 --> 16:15.461
Seeing as how Margaret Chan
was unable to make the trip,

16:15.532 --> 16:17.762
you will be rooming with...

16:17.835 --> 16:20.736
Okay, I am not,
under any circumstances,

16:20.804 --> 16:22.362
sharing a room with -

16:22.439 --> 16:24.532
I'll be taking the bed
by the window.

16:24.608 --> 16:25.939
You don't mind, do you?

16:26.009 --> 16:29.376
Uh, ye-e-e-e-s!

16:30.447 --> 16:31.607
No.

16:31.682 --> 16:34.412
I sleep much better
with the Swiss eiderdown.

16:34.485 --> 16:36.544
Lizzie, seeing as we're roomies

16:36.620 --> 16:38.986
and we're gonna be spending
time together,

16:39.056 --> 16:41.149
I wanted to let you know
I understand

16:41.225 --> 16:44.285
you want to put all that
embarrassing stuff behind you

16:44.361 --> 16:46.829
and just move on
and have a fresh start.

16:47.698 --> 16:49.427
You do?

16:49.500 --> 16:51.263
Yes. I understand
your dream.

16:51.335 --> 16:52.495
It's a big dream.

16:52.569 --> 16:55.402
It's a huge dream,
and you can't do it alone.

16:55.472 --> 16:58.100
In fact, I don't think
you can do it at all.

16:58.175 --> 16:59.233
Let it go.

17:01.245 --> 17:02.610
Lizzie, come on.

17:07.984 --> 17:08.916
Whoa!

17:08.986 --> 17:09.974
Gordo, what?

17:10.053 --> 17:11.714
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

17:11.789 --> 17:12.949
Where are we going?

17:13.022 --> 17:14.547
Look.

17:15.858 --> 17:17.383
Wow!

17:17.461 --> 17:19.895
Pretty cool, huh?

17:24.734 --> 17:26.099
You know what, Gordo?

17:26.170 --> 17:28.866
I'm not gonna let
Kate Sanders get to me.

17:28.939 --> 17:30.167
Promise me something.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.229
Anything.

17:31.308 --> 17:34.243
Promise that when we're here,
we'll find adventures.

17:34.311 --> 17:36.973
All right? This is
our chance to start over.

17:37.047 --> 17:39.572
I mean, do anything
that we want to do.

17:39.650 --> 17:41.845
Yeah. I-I know.
You're right.

17:41.919 --> 17:44.649
Hmm. You and me.
Adventures. Deal.

17:46.390 --> 17:47.687
Deal.

17:53.363 --> 17:55.388
The Trevi Fountain was designed

17:55.466 --> 17:58.993
by Gian Lorenza Bernini
and Peitro da Cortona

17:59.069 --> 18:00.536
in the 17th century.

18:00.604 --> 18:03.698
And it took about 100 years
to finish this bad boy.

18:03.774 --> 18:07.210
Throughout history, people have
come from all over the world

18:07.277 --> 18:10.542
to make a wish and toss their
coin in the Trevi Fountain.

18:10.614 --> 18:12.241
Those people are suckers.

18:12.316 --> 18:14.807
You got to make your own luck
in this world.

18:14.885 --> 18:18.480
All right, moving on, people.
Let's go.

18:18.555 --> 18:19.522
Scusi,

18:19.590 --> 18:21.182
Grazie.

18:21.258 --> 18:23.783
Scusi, Grazie,

18:23.861 --> 18:25.852
You know what?
Forget what she says.

18:25.929 --> 18:27.123
Make a wish.

18:27.197 --> 18:29.427
I'm in Rome
with my best friend.

18:29.500 --> 18:31.195
I'm good.
You make one.

18:31.268 --> 18:32.929
Okay.

18:33.003 --> 18:34.334
Hmm.

18:34.404 --> 18:35.769
Okay.

18:48.285 --> 18:49.877
lsabella?

18:49.953 --> 18:51.420
Huh?

18:52.756 --> 18:56.317
Okay, I was wishing for smooth
sailing through high school,

18:56.393 --> 18:58.418
but this will work.

18:58.495 --> 19:00.395
Uh, I'm sorry.

19:00.464 --> 19:04.764
It's just you look an awful lot
like a friend of mine.

19:04.835 --> 19:07.861
Paolo, you have to get
to your photo shoot.

19:07.938 --> 19:09.064
We got to go.

19:11.008 --> 19:14.239
What you little halflings
are feeling right about now

19:14.311 --> 19:15.903
is your energy flagging.

19:15.979 --> 19:17.674
We got four more stops today.

19:17.748 --> 19:20.239
I want you to
at least be able to shuffle

19:20.317 --> 19:21.841
from monument to monument.

19:21.919 --> 19:24.353
We got one word for that,
and it's gelato.

19:24.421 --> 19:26.582
Keep in mind
that ltalian ice cream has

19:26.657 --> 19:29.217
about twice the sugar
of American ice cream.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.887
Means you're gonna want about
two scoops, huh?

19:31.962 --> 19:33.896
I know I do.
All right.

19:33.964 --> 19:35.488
I don't mean to bother you.

19:35.566 --> 19:37.898
I'm Paolo.
Paolo Valisari.

19:37.968 --> 19:40.334
Oh, um, I'm Lizzie McGuire,

19:40.404 --> 19:42.099
and this is my friend Gordo.

19:42.172 --> 19:43.662
This is my friend Sergei.

19:43.740 --> 19:46.402
Sergei, doesn't she look
exactly like lsabella?

19:46.476 --> 19:47.943
- lsabella!
- Paolo!

19:51.381 --> 19:53.474
Um...

19:53.550 --> 19:54.517
Paolo!

19:54.585 --> 19:56.416
lsabella! Isabella!

19:59.423 --> 20:02.415
Paolo! Paolo!

20:04.161 --> 20:05.822
Ciao, Paolo!

20:08.165 --> 20:09.655
Uh, hmm...

20:11.368 --> 20:13.632
Wow! That really
does look like me.

20:13.704 --> 20:16.730
Except for the hair,
you could be her twin.

20:16.807 --> 20:20.004
Isabella is my singing partner,
and you're like her sister.

20:20.077 --> 20:21.772
Like two pods in a pea.

20:23.547 --> 20:26.448
Lizzie, can I see you again?

20:26.516 --> 20:27.949
Maybe tomorrow?

20:28.018 --> 20:29.383
Please?

20:29.453 --> 20:31.387
What's the word for "yes"
in ltalian?

20:31.455 --> 20:32.547
- Si,

20:32.623 --> 20:33.954
Uh...

20:34.024 --> 20:35.013
No, I'm -

20:35.092 --> 20:36.787
It's okay.
I can cover for you.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.327
Head check!

20:38.395 --> 20:41.057
I'm sorry. I'm here
with my school, so I can't.

20:41.131 --> 20:42.689
Forgive me
if I embarrassed you.

20:42.766 --> 20:44.757
Some people,
when they come to Rome,

20:44.835 --> 20:47.065
they want to find adventure.

20:47.137 --> 20:49.002
Oh, it's okay.

20:49.072 --> 20:51.302
I got some cool cheese.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.434
Did you just say
"cool cheese"?

20:53.510 --> 20:54.477
Wah!

20:54.544 --> 20:56.375
Paolo...

20:56.446 --> 20:57.504
We must go.

20:57.581 --> 21:01.142
Uh, Lizzie,
if you change your mind,

21:01.218 --> 21:04.449
I will meet you tomorrow morning
at the Trevi Fountain at 9:00.

21:04.521 --> 21:05.715
Hey, Gordon, McGuire,

21:05.789 --> 21:07.882
did you not hear me say
"head check"?

21:07.958 --> 21:10.153
15, 16.

21:10.227 --> 21:11.319
Who are you?

21:11.395 --> 21:12.555
Paolo Valisari.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.359
Put your money
in your front pockets.

21:18.769 --> 21:21.067
She makes me very scared.

21:21.138 --> 21:23.265
Join the club.

21:23.340 --> 21:24.830
Lizzie...

21:27.244 --> 21:29.041
Ci vediamo,

21:29.112 --> 21:31.080
What does that mean?

21:31.148 --> 21:33.616
We will see each other.

21:38.922 --> 21:40.253
Hey.

21:40.323 --> 21:42.723
This Paolo and lsabella CD
isn't so bad.

21:42.793 --> 21:45.523
I mean, if you're into
the Alanis Morissette-y,

21:45.595 --> 21:47.756
alternative, dark,
like, brooding,

21:47.831 --> 21:48.855
I-never-go-out-

21:48.932 --> 21:51.901
and-my-life's-a-black-hole-
of-depression kind of thing,

21:51.968 --> 21:53.196
you'd think they stink.

21:53.270 --> 21:56.034
For driving-around-in-the-car-
with- the-top- down,

21:56.106 --> 21:58.370
Ioving-life kind of thing,
they're good.

21:58.442 --> 21:59.670
Here. Listen.

21:59.743 --> 22:02.109
You don't have to sail
the ocean

22:02.179 --> 22:03.510
Yeah, not bad.

22:03.580 --> 22:05.673
You use scented soap, huh?

22:05.749 --> 22:06.841
What?

22:06.917 --> 22:09.750
Um, it -
N-Never - never mind.

22:09.820 --> 22:14.018
So, Paolo wants me to meet him
at the Trevi Fountain tomorrow.

22:14.091 --> 22:15.115
So go.

22:15.192 --> 22:18.218
That would mean I would have to
sneak away from the group.

22:18.295 --> 22:19.284
So?

22:19.362 --> 22:21.023
I'm incapable of sneaking.

22:21.098 --> 22:22.963
Weren't you the one that said

22:23.033 --> 22:26.059
we were gonna have adventures
on this trip?

22:26.136 --> 22:28.400
Yeah. We. We were
going to have adventures.

22:28.472 --> 22:29.734
And we will.

22:29.806 --> 22:33.173
It just so happens that
you have dibs on the first one.

22:34.911 --> 22:35.878
Okay.

22:35.946 --> 22:38.005
Just as long
as we don't do anything

22:38.081 --> 22:41.050
that would get us tossed
on a plane home.

22:41.118 --> 22:43.450
Uh. Unh.

22:43.520 --> 22:45.954
Lizzie, are -
are you feeling okay?

22:59.002 --> 23:01.266
Is this girl sick,
or isn't she?

23:01.338 --> 23:04.432
She doesn't have a fever,
and yet she's in bed.

23:05.809 --> 23:07.970
Ask yourself why
a beautiful young girl

23:08.045 --> 23:10.036
on her first visit
to Rome,

23:10.114 --> 23:11.706
probably seeking adventure,

23:11.782 --> 23:14.273
wants to lie in bed
all day.

23:15.619 --> 23:16.779
She's ill.

23:16.854 --> 23:20.119
I heard she fell down
at graduation,

23:20.190 --> 23:23.091
made a complete fool
out of herself.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.855
I saw that on CNN.

23:24.928 --> 23:26.395
CNN?

23:28.465 --> 23:30.456
Often, the nervous system
collapses

23:30.534 --> 23:32.297
after that type of humiliation.

23:32.369 --> 23:33.358
Hmm.

23:34.872 --> 23:36.772
Do you have
any recommendations?

23:36.840 --> 23:38.637
Oh, yeah, yeah.

23:38.709 --> 23:42.475
This young woman
should stay in bed.

23:42.546 --> 23:47.574
Uh, she - she should
also eat two apricots.

23:47.651 --> 23:49.585
Oh, for digestion or...

23:49.653 --> 23:51.883
No, they're in season.
Very delicious.

23:51.955 --> 23:53.752
Feel better, Signorina McGuire.

23:53.824 --> 23:55.018
You rest up, McGuire.

23:55.092 --> 23:58.152
Don't want you to miss
all the adventures of Rome.

23:58.228 --> 24:00.321
Uh, doctor, I have a boil...

24:27.958 --> 24:29.050
Sorry.

24:33.730 --> 24:35.789
Uno, due, tre,

24:35.866 --> 24:37.026
- Tre,
- Tre,

24:40.404 --> 24:41.803
Bene,

24:47.978 --> 24:51.812
I-I just - I had them all wish
for you to come.

24:55.886 --> 24:57.877
Hmm...

24:57.955 --> 25:01.322
I don't have much time.
You know my chaperon -

25:01.391 --> 25:02.722
Wait, wait, wait.

25:02.793 --> 25:04.954
I have to show you something.

25:05.028 --> 25:06.290
Sometimes the world

25:06.363 --> 25:08.354
Is a valley
of heartaches and tears

25:08.432 --> 25:09.865
- Come on.

25:09.933 --> 25:13.664
And in the hustle and bustle,
no sunshine appears

25:13.737 --> 25:17.036
But you and I have a love
always there to remind us...

25:17.107 --> 25:18.039
Wow!

25:18.108 --> 25:20.269
You should see Rome
the way Romans do.

25:20.344 --> 25:22.312
So you knew
that I would come.

25:22.379 --> 25:23.903
I hoped you would.

25:25.549 --> 25:28.245
Are you sure you know
how to drive this thing?

25:28.318 --> 25:30.809
This is Rome.
Nobody knows how to drive.

25:30.887 --> 25:33.117
Volare

25:33.190 --> 25:35.249
Oh, oh

25:35.325 --> 25:37.088
Cantare

25:37.160 --> 25:39.754
Oh, oh, oh, oh

25:39.830 --> 25:44.358
Let's fly
way up to the clouds

25:44.434 --> 25:47.870
Away from
the maddening crowds

25:47.938 --> 25:50.839
We can sing in the glow
of a star that I know of

25:50.907 --> 25:52.841
Where lovers enjoy
peace of mind

25:52.909 --> 25:56.345
Let us leave the confusion
and all disillusion behind

25:56.413 --> 25:58.278
Just like birds
of a feather

25:58.348 --> 26:01.044
And the rainbow together
we'll find

26:01.118 --> 26:02.813
Volare

26:02.886 --> 26:04.649
Oh, oh

26:04.721 --> 26:06.484
Cantare

26:06.556 --> 26:09.286
Oh, oh, oh, oh

26:15.999 --> 26:18.559
Whoo!

26:36.820 --> 26:38.754
Volare

26:38.822 --> 26:40.221
Oh, oh

26:40.290 --> 26:41.222
Oh, oh

26:41.291 --> 26:42.986
Cantare

26:43.060 --> 26:46.029
Oh, oh, oh, oh

26:46.096 --> 26:50.032
No wonder
my happy heart sings

26:50.100 --> 26:53.866
Your love has given me
wings

26:53.937 --> 26:58.271
No wonder
my happy heart sings

26:58.342 --> 27:03.041
Your love has given me
wings

27:03.113 --> 27:04.944
Wow!

27:06.750 --> 27:09.981
I don't know what catastrophe
is going to happen in Rome,

27:10.053 --> 27:12.180
but with Lizzie there,
something will.

27:12.255 --> 27:15.019
What are you going to do
with that information?

27:15.092 --> 27:18.084
Give it away, like you did
with the graduation video?

27:18.161 --> 27:20.686
Hey! She was really
freaked out by that.

27:20.764 --> 27:22.732
And you have what
to show for it?

27:22.799 --> 27:25.359
The pride of a job well done?

27:25.435 --> 27:28.336
Try buying a PS2 with
the pride of a job well done.

27:28.405 --> 27:29.372
Oh!

27:29.439 --> 27:31.304
Matt, Matt, Matt.

27:31.375 --> 27:34.071
We've been over this
before. Cash up front.

27:34.144 --> 27:37.113
Melina,
are you staying for dinner?

27:37.180 --> 27:39.205
- I'd love to, Mrs. McGuire.
- Great.

27:39.282 --> 27:42.479
We'll need extra energy to work
on our summer reading list.

27:42.552 --> 27:44.577
In that case,
I'll make brownies.

27:44.654 --> 27:45.450
Oh.

27:46.490 --> 27:48.890
I've said it before.
You're weak. Weak!

27:48.959 --> 27:51.621
Don't do anything
without consulting me first.

27:54.664 --> 27:57.258
You rock.

28:11.081 --> 28:14.517
Hey, Paolo,
can I ask you something?

28:14.584 --> 28:15.744
Si, carina,

28:15.819 --> 28:18.913
Um, I know that our lives
are a little different.

28:18.989 --> 28:21.753
Actually, like, several
universes different.

28:21.825 --> 28:25.591
But doesn't Sergei get tired
of following us around?

28:25.662 --> 28:27.687
Actually, Sergei's my bodyguard.

28:27.764 --> 28:29.925
So, you see,
between me and Sergei,

28:30.000 --> 28:31.695
you'll always be safe.

28:34.337 --> 28:35.804
Whoa!

28:35.872 --> 28:39.740
How famous do you have to be
before you need a bodyguard?

28:42.012 --> 28:44.480
Paolo, go! Go!

28:44.548 --> 28:46.709
I-It's Miss Ungermeyer!
It's our bus!

28:50.720 --> 28:51.778
- Go!
- I cannot.

28:53.190 --> 28:56.591
Miss Ungermeyer, didn't we just
pass the Castel Sant'Angelo?

28:56.660 --> 28:57.752
Yep. What about it?

28:57.828 --> 29:00.194
I just noticed
it's not on our itinerary.

29:00.263 --> 29:01.491
That is correct.

29:01.565 --> 29:03.192
Well, s-shouldn't it be?

29:03.266 --> 29:05.461
I-I mean,
it was a papal residence

29:05.535 --> 29:07.093
and it does contain frescoes

29:07.170 --> 29:09.934
from artists influenced
by the school of Raphael.

29:10.006 --> 29:11.769
What are you up to, Gordon?

29:11.842 --> 29:12.866
N-N-Nothing.

29:12.943 --> 29:14.308
I-I just figure that,

29:14.377 --> 29:16.402
while in Rome,
we should be exposed

29:16.480 --> 29:18.744
to as much Renaissance,
Raphaelite work

29:18.815 --> 29:21.807
typified by chiaroscuro
and Hellenic mythical imagery

29:21.885 --> 29:23.352
as humanly possible.

29:25.489 --> 29:27.889
Whew.

29:27.958 --> 29:30.756
Ah, Gordon,
you are on the list,

29:30.827 --> 29:33.261
and the list is not a place
you want to be.

29:33.330 --> 29:35.491
What is this?
Only in Rome, huh?

29:36.933 --> 29:40.369
You know how to move that, or
you want me to do it for you?

29:42.606 --> 29:44.096
What are you looking at?

29:46.243 --> 29:49.337
Want a piece of that,
a piece of the Ungermeyer?

29:56.086 --> 29:58.316
Over there by that statue.
You see it?

29:58.389 --> 29:59.321
Yeah.

29:59.390 --> 30:00.687
That's where
the artist Caravaggio

30:00.758 --> 30:02.953
had his opponent
burned at the stake.

30:03.027 --> 30:04.051
Or was it the pope

30:04.128 --> 30:06.460
who had Caravaggio burned
at the stake?

30:06.530 --> 30:08.760
Either way,
this neighborhood was tough.

30:12.703 --> 30:13.670
Paolo...

30:13.737 --> 30:14.999
Si, carina?

30:16.540 --> 30:18.633
Do you still love her?

30:18.709 --> 30:20.199
Who? Isabella?

30:20.277 --> 30:21.335
Si,

30:23.680 --> 30:25.580
Of course I still love her.

30:25.649 --> 30:27.981
But like a sister.

30:28.052 --> 30:29.815
So, why did you break up?

30:29.887 --> 30:32.583
It's, um, it's complicated.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.252
- What?

30:36.326 --> 30:39.591
Yes, we've been voted "best
pop duo of the year" again.

30:39.663 --> 30:41.654
But I want to do
more serious music.

30:41.732 --> 30:43.563
And when I told this
to lsabella,

30:43.634 --> 30:44.999
she said flat-out "no."

30:45.069 --> 30:47.230
I was forced to tell her,
"This is it.

30:47.304 --> 30:49.272
This will be
our last CD together."

30:49.339 --> 30:50.829
Did she totally freak out?

30:50.908 --> 30:52.341
She totally freak out.

30:52.409 --> 30:54.843
I feel awful about that,
but what about me?

30:54.912 --> 30:56.504
I need to grow as an artist.

30:56.580 --> 30:57.512
Yeah.

30:57.581 --> 30:59.742
So, the other day
when I saw you,

30:59.817 --> 31:02.479
I just - I don't know,
I had this crazy -

31:02.553 --> 31:03.952
I just - I don't know.

31:04.021 --> 31:05.318
W-What?

31:05.389 --> 31:08.290
I had this crazy idea
that maybe you could help me.

31:11.662 --> 31:14.825
Come on. How crazy could it be?
Just tell me.

31:14.898 --> 31:17.025
No, I can't.
It's too - It's too...

31:17.101 --> 31:18.625
- Please.
- Okay.

31:18.702 --> 31:21.899
Isabella and I are supposed to
present an award together

31:21.972 --> 31:24.202
at the International
Music Video Awards.

31:24.274 --> 31:25.571
Cool!

31:25.642 --> 31:28.338
I-I mean, cool for
regular people like me,

31:28.412 --> 31:30.437
but for you,
I guess it's like work.

31:30.514 --> 31:32.379
No, no, no.
It's cool for me, too.

31:32.449 --> 31:34.417
You get all kinds
of free stuff.

31:34.485 --> 31:36.749
But now because lsabella's
so mad at me,

31:36.820 --> 31:38.219
she's refusing to appear.

31:38.288 --> 31:41.655
The record company's threatening
to sue if she doesn't show up.

31:41.725 --> 31:42.657
What about you?

31:42.726 --> 31:44.956
For me is no problem.
I write the music.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.962
I don't know
where it comes from.

31:47.030 --> 31:48.622
It just comes from me.

31:48.699 --> 31:49.791
La la la la

31:49.867 --> 31:52.062
See?
So I can go solo.

31:52.136 --> 31:53.501
But lsabella...

31:56.206 --> 31:58.572
She needs the help to sing.

31:58.642 --> 32:00.303
You mean lsabella lip-synchs?

32:00.377 --> 32:01.309
Please, please!

32:01.378 --> 32:03.846
Promise me you
will speak of this to no one.

32:03.914 --> 32:06.542
Imagine what would happen
to lsabella's career.

32:06.617 --> 32:09.643
Oh, that's so sweet.
You still care about her.

32:11.555 --> 32:13.580
You're definitely
broken up, right?

32:13.657 --> 32:14.589
Si,

32:14.658 --> 32:16.558
So, when I saw you yesterday

32:16.627 --> 32:18.925
and how people thought
you were lsabella,

32:18.996 --> 32:20.054
I got my crazy idea

32:20.130 --> 32:22.621
that maybe you could pretend
to be lsabella

32:22.699 --> 32:24.929
and present the award
with me onstage.

32:25.002 --> 32:27.402
Present an award?
O-Onstage?

32:30.941 --> 32:32.772
In front of an audience?

32:32.843 --> 32:35.869
I-I-I'm really not good
in front of crowds.

32:35.946 --> 32:37.504
I could never do that.

32:37.581 --> 32:39.549
Of course you can do it.

32:39.616 --> 32:41.277
You are magnifico.

32:42.686 --> 32:46.349
I don't know ltalian,
but I know what that means.

32:49.493 --> 32:51.688
I don't know, Paolo.
I...

32:51.762 --> 32:54.162
Don't worry, carina,

32:54.231 --> 32:56.859
I could never ask you to do
this crazy thing.

33:01.872 --> 33:05.205
No. You know what?
You don't have to ask.

33:05.275 --> 33:08.073
If this is gonna help
you and lsabella, then...

33:09.813 --> 33:10.973
...I'll do it.

33:12.182 --> 33:13.410
Grazie!

33:13.483 --> 33:15.280
Prego!

33:36.106 --> 33:38.040
Head check!

33:45.148 --> 33:47.446
Gordo. Gordo.

33:50.454 --> 33:53.685
You, Lizzie McGuire,
are actually presenting an award

33:53.757 --> 33:55.247
at the lMVAs with Paolo?

33:55.325 --> 33:56.952
No. Me lsabella with Paolo.

33:57.027 --> 33:58.654
- What?
- It's a long story.

33:58.729 --> 34:00.720
I'm doing it because
lsabella won't.

34:00.797 --> 34:04.130
You're gonna get up onstage
in front of all these people?

34:04.201 --> 34:06.999
That's the great thing.
It's not gonna be me.

34:07.070 --> 34:08.969
It's Paolo's idea
to help lsabella

34:09.039 --> 34:11.132
because he still loves her.

34:11.208 --> 34:14.143
But not romantically.
Like a sister.

34:14.210 --> 34:15.838
He is so amazing.

34:15.911 --> 34:16.900
And he's 17!

34:16.980 --> 34:18.242
For being so famous

34:18.315 --> 34:21.216
and used to getting everything
that you want,

34:21.284 --> 34:23.947
he's just -
he's just so kind.

34:24.021 --> 34:25.386
For real?

34:25.455 --> 34:27.514
That's a lot
to say about someone

34:27.591 --> 34:28.989
just knowing them a day.

34:29.059 --> 34:30.185
I-I know that.

34:30.260 --> 34:33.127
But I feel like
I've known him my whole life.

34:33.196 --> 34:34.629
Anyway, um...

34:34.697 --> 34:37.393
I just wanted to come by
and thank you.

34:37.467 --> 34:39.492
I had the most magical day
of my life.

34:39.569 --> 34:42.197
It wouldn't have happened
if it weren't for you.

34:43.273 --> 34:44.534
It was that good, huh?

34:44.608 --> 34:46.473
You're such a good friend.

34:49.246 --> 34:50.975
The sting.

34:52.349 --> 34:53.646
What sting?

34:53.717 --> 34:55.911
You want a little mano a mano?

34:57.621 --> 34:59.646
See, this is
one of the reasons

34:59.723 --> 35:01.418
me and you aren't friends.

35:01.491 --> 35:04.426
I never have any idea
what you're talking about.

35:04.494 --> 35:06.394
Some dudes get the approach.

35:06.463 --> 35:07.589
Others, the sting.

35:07.664 --> 35:10.394
That ltalian dude.
He's big-time approach.

35:10.467 --> 35:13.800
I actually feel my brain
turning into goo.

35:13.870 --> 35:15.303
Embrace the sting.

35:15.372 --> 35:17.567
That's what you're vibin'
from Lizzie.

35:17.641 --> 35:19.040
Wait a minute.

35:19.109 --> 35:22.442
Now, you actually think
that I'm jealous of Paolo?

35:22.512 --> 35:24.412
Word.

35:24.481 --> 35:25.971
Oh, no.

35:26.049 --> 35:27.880
No, see, that would mean

35:27.951 --> 35:30.351
that I like Lizzie
as more than a friend.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.684
You and I
have trouble communicating?

35:32.756 --> 35:34.314
You're wrong, man.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.090
Whoa!

35:38.161 --> 35:41.324
This girl looks freakishly
like my sister!

35:42.332 --> 35:43.697
- Ow.
- Zoom! Zoom!

35:46.269 --> 35:48.237
Another freakish coincidence.

35:48.305 --> 35:51.468
I mean, she has the same
necklace as my sister's.

35:51.541 --> 35:52.735
Huh.

35:52.809 --> 35:56.142
Why do we even pretend
you're in charge?

35:57.881 --> 36:00.372
- Let's see what this says.

36:00.450 --> 36:01.508
Ow.

36:01.585 --> 36:02.916
"lsabella goes blond.

36:02.986 --> 36:05.250
Italian pop duo
Paolo and lsabella

36:05.322 --> 36:08.348
wowed the crowd outside a shop
near the Trevi Fountain,

36:08.425 --> 36:10.620
showing off lsabella's
new blond hair."

36:10.694 --> 36:14.494
They must think that Lizzie
is this famous singer!

36:14.564 --> 36:19.126
And if I show this to my mom,
Lizzie will be so busted!

36:19.202 --> 36:22.603
If you show this to your mom,
it's worth nothing.

36:22.672 --> 36:27.609
But if you show this
to the ltalian tabloids,

36:27.677 --> 36:30.612
we will be rolling in cash,
my friend.

36:30.680 --> 36:32.807
Interesting!

36:36.319 --> 36:37.786
"We"?

36:37.854 --> 36:39.236
Not up to toughing it out
on the streets with us?

36:39.237 --> 36:40.618
Not up to toughing it out
on the streets with us?

36:42.192 --> 36:43.853
I could try, Miss Ungermeyer.

36:43.928 --> 36:46.158
No, I just hate seeing you
being denied

36:46.230 --> 36:49.290
the cultural experience
of being in a foreign country.

36:49.366 --> 36:50.731
You missed seven points

36:50.801 --> 36:52.894
of historical significance
yesterday.

36:52.970 --> 36:56.428
I know. It's really killing me
too, Miss Ungermeyer.

36:56.507 --> 36:59.601
Which is why I thought
I'd bring you something

36:59.677 --> 37:01.474
to help ease the pain, hmm?

37:01.545 --> 37:04.605
Mmh, well, that's really
thoughtful of you.

37:04.682 --> 37:07.207
Seeing as how
your teeny- tiny little body

37:07.284 --> 37:08.751
doesn't have the strength,

37:08.819 --> 37:12.186
we're gonna have to let
your mind do the wandering.

37:12.256 --> 37:13.655
Ah!

37:13.724 --> 37:16.420
"The Rise and Decline
of the Roman Empire," hmm?

37:16.493 --> 37:19.485
I'd like one report on the rise
and one on the decline.

37:19.563 --> 37:20.552
Ouch!

37:20.631 --> 37:23.862
If I didn't have a headache
a minute ago, I do now.

37:25.436 --> 37:27.870
You don't have a problem
with that, do you?

37:27.938 --> 37:29.735
Um, no.

37:29.807 --> 37:32.867
- What else do I have to do?

37:32.943 --> 37:35.002
Why not

37:35.079 --> 37:36.842
Take a crazy chance?

37:36.914 --> 37:39.109
Why not

37:39.183 --> 37:41.242
Do a crazy dance?

37:41.318 --> 37:43.218
If you lose the moment

37:43.287 --> 37:45.016
You might lose a lot

37:45.089 --> 37:47.580
So why not?

37:47.658 --> 37:49.626
Why not?

37:49.693 --> 37:52.389
Why not
take a crazy chance?

37:54.832 --> 37:55.890
Wow.

38:00.471 --> 38:02.234
I am so grateful for your help.

38:02.306 --> 38:04.774
You're doing a very kind thing
for lsabella.

38:04.842 --> 38:07.037
Uh, Paolo, where are we?

38:07.111 --> 38:09.409
Via Condotti.
One of the most expensive

38:09.480 --> 38:11.345
shopping districts
in the world.

38:11.415 --> 38:13.747
We must find you
the perfect outfit.

38:16.186 --> 38:17.118
Ah!

38:17.187 --> 38:18.984
Oh, hey, lsabella, Paolo!

38:19.056 --> 38:20.546
Ciao!

38:20.624 --> 38:23.184
Your hair is so blond
and, uh, innocent.

38:23.260 --> 38:24.887
- Who did it?
- Um...

38:24.962 --> 38:27.726
The island we were on
was really, really sunny,

38:27.798 --> 38:29.527
so it was j-just the sun.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.999
We must get sun, too, no?

38:31.068 --> 38:32.365
Ciao, bella!

38:32.436 --> 38:33.664
Ciao, Ciao, Ciao.

38:33.737 --> 38:35.261
They are so tall!

38:35.339 --> 38:38.308
- They all want to be you.
- They want to be lsabella.

38:38.375 --> 38:41.208
Sit and I'll get Franca.
I will just be a moment.

38:43.380 --> 38:44.779
Whoa! Take your time.

38:44.848 --> 38:47.942
I'll just be sitting here
in heaven.

38:48.018 --> 38:49.417
Hard as it is to imagine,

38:49.486 --> 38:51.681
as we look at the ruins
of the Forum,

38:51.755 --> 38:54.121
that this was once
the center of commerce,

38:54.191 --> 38:57.058
religion, and politics
in ancient Rome.

38:57.127 --> 38:59.459
All right, now,
the Forum came into being

38:59.530 --> 39:01.725
in the sixth century B.C.,

39:01.799 --> 39:06.133
and with it,
a new urban culture was born.

39:06.203 --> 39:07.602
Uh, um, di-

39:07.671 --> 39:09.263
Yeah, Craft?

39:09.339 --> 39:11.068
Is it time for the spaghetti?

39:11.141 --> 39:12.802
It's 9:00 in the morning.

39:12.876 --> 39:15.743
So? You never had leftover
spaghetti for breakfast?

39:15.813 --> 39:17.007
I don't eat carbs.

39:17.081 --> 39:19.481
You never had
a spaghetti sandwich, either?

39:19.550 --> 39:23.418
This cultural experience
is, like, so wasted on you.

39:23.487 --> 39:26.285
Excuse me, where did you
buy that Prada bag?

39:27.524 --> 39:29.424
Craft! Sanders! Separate.

39:29.493 --> 39:31.757
We did, Miss Ungermeyer.
And thank God.

39:33.230 --> 39:36.324
Why don't you people, uh,
do something at your, uh,

39:36.400 --> 39:37.560
skill level here?

39:37.634 --> 39:41.502
Take a 10-minute shopping break
while I choke down an espresso.

39:43.040 --> 39:46.134
This dude definitely spent
too much time on his biceps

39:46.210 --> 39:49.509
and not enough on his abs.
Totally old school.

39:54.218 --> 39:55.776
Wha-

39:55.853 --> 39:57.286
Nice spy, bro.

39:57.354 --> 39:58.878
Yeah, watch and learn.

39:58.956 --> 40:01.754
The slow curve.
Works every time.

40:01.825 --> 40:03.292
I've got to talk to them.

40:03.360 --> 40:06.420
That's not how the slow curve
works. They come to us.

40:10.300 --> 40:12.359
Um, eh, ciao.

40:12.436 --> 40:13.994
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

40:14.071 --> 40:16.403
Do you guys speak English?

40:16.473 --> 40:17.735
Yes.

40:17.808 --> 40:19.867
It is your friend we like.

40:19.943 --> 40:21.501
Word.

40:21.578 --> 40:23.205
Word?
Is that his name?

40:23.280 --> 40:24.247
Yeah, sure.

40:24.314 --> 40:26.544
Do you know who that is
on the cover?

40:26.617 --> 40:29.177
- Oh, lsabella. Certo,
- Certo,

40:29.253 --> 40:31.983
Do you think you guys could
translate it for me?

40:32.055 --> 40:35.650
Um, only if
you introduce us to Word.

40:36.660 --> 40:38.525
Can I keep the magazine, then?

40:38.595 --> 40:40.222
Deal!

40:40.297 --> 40:42.822
All right.
Let's go.

40:49.940 --> 40:51.532
Ciao, Word.

40:52.543 --> 40:53.669
Word?

40:54.912 --> 40:55.844
Mmh?

40:55.913 --> 40:56.971
English?

40:57.047 --> 40:58.571
She's speaking English.

40:58.649 --> 41:01.914
Our single is in English
and lsabella needs to practice.

41:04.521 --> 41:07.684
What have you done?

41:07.758 --> 41:09.089
Uh, uh, uh...

41:09.159 --> 41:12.686
You look...
You look like a schoolgirl.

41:14.765 --> 41:16.756
Maximus, what is wrong?

41:16.833 --> 41:17.925
You love lsabella.

41:18.001 --> 41:20.265
Nice Maximus.

41:23.974 --> 41:26.067
Very odd.

41:27.110 --> 41:29.704
There is something...

41:29.780 --> 41:32.908
something very different
about you.

41:32.983 --> 41:34.143
Um...

41:34.218 --> 41:35.412
Rest.

41:35.485 --> 41:37.783
The rest on the island
did lsabella good.

41:37.854 --> 41:38.912
She is transformed.

41:38.989 --> 41:40.115
Yeah.

41:40.190 --> 41:42.590
Well, I cannot
put clothes on this.

41:42.659 --> 41:43.819
You - fix the hair.

41:43.894 --> 41:45.054
Fix the eyebrows.

41:45.128 --> 41:46.060
Fix the lips.

41:47.130 --> 41:48.620
- Oh!
- And fix the ears!

41:48.699 --> 41:50.223
Fix the ears?

41:50.300 --> 41:52.894
Jewelry.

41:52.970 --> 41:54.130
Jewelry.

41:54.204 --> 41:56.570
That's a language
every girl understands.

41:59.376 --> 42:00.934
You better work

42:01.011 --> 42:01.943
Covergirl

42:02.012 --> 42:02.979
Work it, girl

42:03.046 --> 42:04.172
Give it a twirl

42:04.248 --> 42:05.806
Do your thing

42:05.882 --> 42:07.611
On the runway

42:07.684 --> 42:09.311
Work

42:09.386 --> 42:11.479
You better work it, girl

42:11.555 --> 42:13.216
Wet your lips

42:13.290 --> 42:15.349
And smile to the camera

42:15.425 --> 42:17.188
Work

42:17.261 --> 42:18.626
- Ah! Aah!
- Work

42:18.695 --> 42:20.629
- Turn to the right
- Oh!

42:20.697 --> 42:21.686
Sashay

42:21.765 --> 42:23.357
Chante

42:23.433 --> 42:27.392
Well, it don't matter
what you wear

42:27.471 --> 42:29.871
They're checkin' out
your savoir faire

42:29.940 --> 42:31.464
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah

42:31.541 --> 42:34.999
And when you walked
into the room

42:35.078 --> 42:39.139
You had everybody's eyes
on you

42:39.216 --> 42:40.547
Supermodel

42:47.524 --> 42:49.549
Work

42:49.626 --> 42:51.560
Work it, girl

42:51.628 --> 42:53.493
Do your thing

42:53.563 --> 42:55.326
On the runway

42:55.399 --> 42:58.300
Work,
you've got to work it, girl

42:58.368 --> 42:59.460
Of the world

42:59.536 --> 43:00.867
Wet your lips

43:00.937 --> 43:02.871
And smile to the camera

43:02.939 --> 43:04.873
Work

43:04.941 --> 43:06.636
Work

43:06.710 --> 43:07.699
- Aah!
- Work

43:07.778 --> 43:09.336
Sashay

43:09.413 --> 43:10.641
Chante

43:10.714 --> 43:12.443
Work

43:12.516 --> 43:14.313
Work

43:14.384 --> 43:15.578
Work

43:15.652 --> 43:16.584
Sashay

43:16.653 --> 43:17.585
Chante

43:17.654 --> 43:19.918
You better work

43:19.990 --> 43:21.981
Work

43:22.059 --> 43:23.026
Work

43:23.093 --> 43:24.321
Give it up

43:24.394 --> 43:27.591
On the ru-u-u-nway

43:27.664 --> 43:29.325
Work

43:29.399 --> 43:31.731
Work

43:31.802 --> 43:34.999
Ohhhh

43:35.072 --> 43:36.198
Whoo

43:39.009 --> 43:41.534
Okay. Diva - good.

43:41.611 --> 43:42.942
Tacky - bad.

43:44.748 --> 43:47.046
We'll have to fix that.

43:57.260 --> 43:58.989
Okay, none of these are me.

43:59.062 --> 44:01.553
- Why are you laughing at me?

44:01.631 --> 44:03.394
You're not supposed to be you.

44:03.467 --> 44:06.095
If I have to go onstage
as lsabella,

44:06.169 --> 44:08.933
then I-I'm gonna have to
be confident,

44:09.005 --> 44:10.905
and that's the thing
I'm worst at.

44:10.974 --> 44:13.534
- We are all the same that way.
- Not you.

44:13.610 --> 44:15.134
Yes, me, and lsabella, too.

44:15.212 --> 44:17.271
It's how she works
through her fears

44:17.347 --> 44:18.507
that makes her strong.

44:18.582 --> 44:20.982
Isabella doesn't let
Franca di Montecatini

44:21.051 --> 44:22.416
tell her what to wear.

44:22.486 --> 44:24.477
Isabella tells Franca.

44:24.554 --> 44:26.283
Okay, so you're telling me

44:26.356 --> 44:28.551
to tell Franca
di Monteca-teca- tecatini

44:28.625 --> 44:29.853
how I should dress?

44:29.926 --> 44:30.915
Si,

44:32.662 --> 44:33.993
Test your strength.

44:34.064 --> 44:35.929
Vai! Vai, vai,

44:37.100 --> 44:38.624
You don't like my clothes?

44:38.702 --> 44:41.170
No. No.
I-I love your clothes.

44:41.238 --> 44:43.103
But I don't want you
to dress me.

44:43.173 --> 44:45.368
What?!

44:45.442 --> 44:47.501
See, I'm not your Barbie doll.

44:47.577 --> 44:49.340
I am lsabella Parigi,

44:49.413 --> 44:51.438
and I dress myself.

44:51.515 --> 44:52.914
So, choices.

44:52.983 --> 44:54.416
I-I need choices.

44:56.486 --> 44:58.113
Whoa.

45:00.490 --> 45:02.822
I really like these two.
You pick.

45:07.297 --> 45:08.286
Both.

45:08.365 --> 45:10.196
Both.

45:10.267 --> 45:11.427
Wow.

45:11.501 --> 45:14.368
This is the exact color
I wore to my spring formal.

45:14.438 --> 45:16.906
- Danny Kessler thought...

45:18.408 --> 45:21.866
Look at all of you.
You'd think that I'm American.

45:21.945 --> 45:24.641
I am,
how you say, um...

45:24.714 --> 45:25.646
awesome?

45:28.952 --> 45:31.546
The island.
You should go more often.

45:31.621 --> 45:33.054
Mmh.

45:34.157 --> 45:35.556
Ooh, ooh, ooh

45:35.625 --> 45:38.219
Goodbye, Lizzie McGuire.
Hello, fabulous.

45:39.896 --> 45:41.625
Yeah, yeah, yeah

45:41.698 --> 45:42.995
Come on

45:43.066 --> 45:45.694
You make me feel
like a star

45:45.769 --> 45:46.827
Oh, baby

45:46.903 --> 45:49.371
You say, "Stay, baby, stay

45:49.439 --> 45:50.997
Just the way you are"

45:51.074 --> 45:54.066
And tell me, "Girl, you're
fine and you will shine

45:54.144 --> 45:55.805
Forever in my heart"

45:55.879 --> 45:58.575
That's why you,
yeah, you

45:58.648 --> 46:02.084
You make me feel
like a star

46:02.152 --> 46:04.245
Ooh, ooh, ooh

46:04.321 --> 46:05.515
- There you go.
- Grazie.

46:05.589 --> 46:06.521
Grazie.

46:06.590 --> 46:08.217
Ooh, ooh, ooh

46:09.259 --> 46:10.726
I'm ready for my close-up.

46:10.794 --> 46:11.920
- Whoo!

46:14.331 --> 46:17.027
I cannot believe
that not one Roman guy

46:17.100 --> 46:18.624
has asked me out yet.

46:22.305 --> 46:23.397
Look.

46:23.473 --> 46:25.703
Paolo...

46:25.775 --> 46:26.901
We gotta go!

46:28.922 --> 46:31.482
Where's the zoom
on this thing?

46:31.558 --> 46:34.049
Uh, uh...

46:38.331 --> 46:39.992
Hello? Excuse me.

46:41.067 --> 46:42.466
Oh!

46:42.536 --> 46:44.595
I'm sorry.
I was just...

46:45.939 --> 46:47.839
Hup! Head check!

46:47.908 --> 46:50.672
Let's go! On the bus,
then back to the hotel!

46:50.744 --> 46:52.871
Come on! Come on! Go!

46:52.946 --> 46:54.709
Andiamo! Andiamo!

47:09.062 --> 47:11.030
- Hold on!

47:11.097 --> 47:12.724
Okay! Hello.

47:12.799 --> 47:15.962
Hotel Cambini.
This is Giorgio.

47:17.103 --> 47:18.730
- Go!
- Huh? What?

47:18.805 --> 47:20.568
Wait.

47:20.640 --> 47:22.437
Excuse me,
can you fix this?

47:22.509 --> 47:23.976
It will not close.

47:24.044 --> 47:27.070
Why is it open
when there is no rain?

47:27.147 --> 47:28.705
This umbrella is stubborn.

47:28.782 --> 47:31.250
It's bad luck to have
an open umbrella inside.

47:31.318 --> 47:33.843
- In Hotel Cambini, no bad luck.
- Hey, thanks.

47:33.920 --> 47:35.478
GlORGlO:
Ah!

47:38.959 --> 47:41.120
One at a time.
No running.

47:43.430 --> 47:45.557
Ha ha ha!

47:45.632 --> 47:49.124
Ha! Ha ha!
Age before beauty, huh?

47:50.503 --> 47:53.563
You look strangely large
and familiar.

47:53.640 --> 47:54.834
Which floor?

47:54.908 --> 47:57.035
Oh. Thank you. First.

47:57.110 --> 47:58.168
Okay.

48:01.014 --> 48:02.276
Little hint for you -

48:02.349 --> 48:05.375
you want to push the button,
elevator moves.

48:05.452 --> 48:07.545
Elevator is not safe.

48:07.621 --> 48:08.986
You an employee here?

48:09.055 --> 48:10.545
- No.
- No.

48:10.624 --> 48:13.491
Who are you to tell me
whether the elevator's safe?

48:13.560 --> 48:14.686
I am Sergei.

48:14.761 --> 48:16.456
Sergei.

48:16.529 --> 48:19.362
You're gonna have to
stand down immediately.

48:22.869 --> 48:25.360
Just because you are one hunk
of Slavic muscle

48:25.438 --> 48:28.407
does not mean you're not
gonna make it on my list!

48:28.475 --> 48:30.534
Elevator is safe now.

48:39.052 --> 48:40.986
Hey! Your umbrella!

48:48.629 --> 48:50.597
Feeling any better?

48:50.664 --> 48:51.790
Mom?

48:55.135 --> 48:56.261
Still a little warm.

48:56.336 --> 48:58.361
Miss Sanders,
would you be so kind

48:58.438 --> 49:00.030
as to look after her for me?

49:00.107 --> 49:03.133
As in do stuff for her?
Why should I be punished?

49:03.210 --> 49:04.837
I'm not the one who's sick.

49:04.912 --> 49:07.278
Next year, I'm joining
the mouth breathers

49:07.347 --> 49:08.871
at Water-slide Wonderland.

49:08.949 --> 49:10.678
You are so busted.

49:10.751 --> 49:12.844
You've been out
of this hotel room.

49:12.920 --> 49:14.046
What?

49:15.055 --> 49:16.215
How do you know?

49:16.290 --> 49:17.484
Please.

49:17.558 --> 49:20.857
Your eyebrows finally match,
your hair has highlights,

49:20.928 --> 49:22.555
fresh manicure.

49:22.629 --> 49:25.962
I smelled acetone the second
I walked in the lobby.

49:26.033 --> 49:29.434
Okay, but you didn't rat me out
to Miss Ungermeyer.

49:29.503 --> 49:30.527
Yet.

49:30.604 --> 49:33.072
Not until I figure out
what's in it for me.

49:33.140 --> 49:34.767
Now spill, Dorkerella.

49:38.045 --> 49:40.411
You'll never make me talk!

49:40.480 --> 49:42.209
I-I know that this
sounds insane,

49:42.282 --> 49:45.410
but I think Paolo
really does like me.

49:45.485 --> 49:48.147
How could this happen?
How did you get my trip?

49:48.222 --> 49:50.520
How is Lizzie McGuire
living this fantasy

49:50.591 --> 49:52.582
and I can't even get
an ltalian boy

49:52.659 --> 49:54.490
to buy me a plate of spaghetti?

49:54.561 --> 49:56.859
Um, Kate,
you don't eat spaghetti.

49:57.865 --> 50:00.766
I'd eat carbs if an ltalian boy
bought them for me.

50:01.835 --> 50:06.534
So, I suppose you want me
to keep quiet about this?

50:07.541 --> 50:09.441
Yeah.
I'd appreciate that.

50:09.509 --> 50:10.874
Well, I'll keep it quiet

50:10.944 --> 50:13.674
if you keep it quiet
about me keeping it quiet.

50:13.747 --> 50:17.114
And when we get back home,
I'm the cool one again,

50:17.184 --> 50:19.084
and you turn
back into a pumpkin.

50:20.520 --> 50:22.044
Oh, my God. It's her.

50:22.122 --> 50:23.350
What are you doing?

50:23.423 --> 50:25.550
Uh, it's a long story.

50:26.460 --> 50:28.155
What do you want?
We're closed.

50:28.228 --> 50:31.391
I-I just wanted
to talk to Lizzie.

50:31.465 --> 50:32.454
So talk.

50:32.532 --> 50:35.126
I was kind of thinking
maybe, you know,

50:35.202 --> 50:36.829
outside in the courtyard.

50:36.904 --> 50:39.168
If this is about
that parallel-universe,

50:39.239 --> 50:42.072
Italian-rock-star,
Lizzie's- suddenly-a- diva thing,

50:42.142 --> 50:43.769
I know all about it.

50:43.844 --> 50:45.175
She figured it out.

50:46.880 --> 50:48.643
Evil and smart.

50:48.715 --> 50:50.307
Embrace it. Fear it.

50:50.384 --> 50:52.545
You might want
to take a look at this.

50:52.619 --> 50:55.349
I'm on the front cover
of a tabloid!

50:55.422 --> 50:57.447
I wish to thank everyone

50:57.524 --> 51:00.823
who's always believed in me
for this great honor.

51:00.894 --> 51:02.521
Do you know what that says?

51:02.596 --> 51:05.360
Paolo and lsabella
are supposed to be singing

51:05.432 --> 51:06.694
at the music awards.

51:06.767 --> 51:08.860
Well, it's got to be a mistake.

51:08.936 --> 51:11.200
I had some ltalian girls
translate it.

51:11.271 --> 51:12.636
Paolo didn't tell you?

51:12.706 --> 51:13.638
Mmh, no.

51:13.707 --> 51:16.471
Don't you think it's weird
he tried to hide this?

51:16.543 --> 51:17.669
Can you believe it?

51:17.744 --> 51:19.507
Maybe it's a last-minute thing.

51:19.579 --> 51:22.446
Aren't these things planned
months in advance?

51:22.516 --> 51:25.917
When did you become an expert
on ltalian award-show thingies?

51:25.986 --> 51:28.682
It's called common sense,
which I have a lot of

51:28.755 --> 51:31.383
to make up for my lack
of the slow curve.

51:31.458 --> 51:32.720
Slow curve?

51:32.793 --> 51:33.953
Forget it.

51:34.027 --> 51:35.995
If you want to believe
some ltalian kid

51:36.063 --> 51:37.894
you think you know
after two days

51:37.965 --> 51:39.865
because he's
an international superstar,

51:39.933 --> 51:42.731
is really rich and has
nice hair, be my guest.

51:42.803 --> 51:43.861
Gordo.

51:52.813 --> 51:54.246
Oh, my God! He's early!

52:00.887 --> 52:01.979
Lizzie.

52:02.055 --> 52:04.023
Oh, my God,
I gotta get dressed.

52:04.091 --> 52:07.390
I'll cover for you in case
Miss Ungermeyer does one of her

52:07.461 --> 52:09.622
middle-of-the-night,
head-check things.

52:09.696 --> 52:10.958
Thanks. I owe you.

52:11.031 --> 52:12.055
Duh!

52:18.005 --> 52:20.565
Mom, Dad, I found something
on the Internet

52:20.640 --> 52:22.471
I think you both should see.

52:22.542 --> 52:23.770
What is it?

52:23.844 --> 52:25.573
Since Lizzie's in Europe,

52:25.645 --> 52:28.170
I thought I'd do
a little E- search on ltaly.

52:28.248 --> 52:29.272
That's nice, son.

52:29.349 --> 52:32.546
But what I found out,
it's not so E-assuring.

52:33.787 --> 52:37.245
In fact, it may shock you.

52:38.091 --> 52:39.422
What are we looking at?

52:39.493 --> 52:42.690
Maybe nothing, and, uh,
maybe something.

52:42.763 --> 52:45.288
You see, when polled,

52:45.365 --> 52:48.459
74% of ltalian teenage boys

52:48.535 --> 52:52.403
said they would most like
to date American girls.

52:52.472 --> 52:54.201
Where'd you get these numbers?

52:54.274 --> 52:57.107
They're available for anyone
who has a computer.

52:57.177 --> 52:59.543
You don't have to worry
about your sister.

52:59.613 --> 53:02.241
She's well-chaperoned.
Miss Ungermeyer's there.

53:02.315 --> 53:06.149
Yeah, what is she,
5'1", 5'2" max?

53:09.189 --> 53:10.918
Oh, please.

53:10.991 --> 53:14.222
Matt, as interesting
as this is,

53:14.294 --> 53:15.955
where are you taking it?

53:16.029 --> 53:18.589
All right, you caught me.

53:18.665 --> 53:19.632
I always do.

53:19.699 --> 53:22.031
I don't know why I even try.

53:24.137 --> 53:26.332
I'll deny
I ever said this, but...

53:27.574 --> 53:29.405
...I miss my sister.

53:29.476 --> 53:31.239
There. I said it.

53:31.311 --> 53:33.074
Now you know.

53:34.114 --> 53:36.810
I know I rag on her
all the time,

53:36.883 --> 53:40.444
but now that she's gone,
I-I -

53:40.520 --> 53:43.148
Oh, honey, we miss her, too.

53:43.223 --> 53:45.248
So, so much.

53:45.325 --> 53:47.589
I feel so alone!

53:47.661 --> 53:50.255
Oh! Listen to me.

53:50.330 --> 53:53.788
You don't have to
make fake pie charts.

53:53.867 --> 53:56.665
You just come to us
with the truth, okay?

53:56.736 --> 53:58.795
I know that now, Mom.

54:00.006 --> 54:01.496
It's just so hard.

54:01.575 --> 54:02.769
I miss her so much!

54:02.843 --> 54:03.775
Oh!

54:04.945 --> 54:07.175
I can't believe
I let you talk me into

54:07.247 --> 54:10.307
Ietting her go
on that trip!

54:10.383 --> 54:12.078
I'll go get the passports.

54:12.152 --> 54:13.449
Oh, honey.

54:14.421 --> 54:15.718
- Shh.

54:15.789 --> 54:17.916
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

54:21.895 --> 54:24.693
Ah, hmm, ah.

54:25.765 --> 54:27.357
Hmm.

54:27.434 --> 54:29.129
Uh...

54:29.202 --> 54:33.332
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmmmm.

54:44.217 --> 54:45.309
Hmm?

54:48.288 --> 54:49.312
Hmm.

54:49.389 --> 54:50.447
Hmm!

55:01.001 --> 55:02.992
- Paolo.
- Si,

55:04.004 --> 55:05.232
What is this?

55:05.305 --> 55:07.273
Uh, a car.

55:09.342 --> 55:12.505
Look, are we supposed to sing?

55:12.579 --> 55:13.671
Scusa?

55:15.015 --> 55:17.279
Don't speak to me in ltalian.

55:17.350 --> 55:18.681
It's too adorable.

55:19.986 --> 55:23.080
Are Paolo and lsabella
supposed to sing at the awards?

55:23.156 --> 55:24.714
Si,

55:24.791 --> 55:27.055
Si?! Well,
why didn't you tell me?

55:27.127 --> 55:30.290
I wanted to, but you told me
not to telephone the hotel.

55:30.363 --> 55:33.093
Get in. I'll explain
everything on the way.

55:33.166 --> 55:36.397
I want to show you the
Tivoli Gardens before sunset.

55:36.469 --> 55:37.458
Come on.

55:37.537 --> 55:39.402
We have to get you back
by 10:00.

55:39.472 --> 55:40.905
Okay.

55:44.044 --> 55:46.569
So, where is Sergei?

55:46.646 --> 55:49.706
You're not the only one
who sneaks off at night.

55:58.858 --> 56:01.053
lsabella and I
were going to sing,

56:01.127 --> 56:02.890
but after lsabella
would not speak to me,

56:02.963 --> 56:05.329
I told the producers
we refuse to perform.

56:05.398 --> 56:07.730
I said lsabella
had throat problems.

56:07.801 --> 56:08.961
So, what happened?

56:09.035 --> 56:10.366
I mean, what changed?

56:10.437 --> 56:11.870
Isabella did.

56:11.938 --> 56:14.600
The real lsabella
or me lsabella?

56:14.674 --> 56:16.835
You. A reporter
heard her speaking,

56:16.910 --> 56:19.344
and he reported
lsabella's voice was fine.

56:19.412 --> 56:21.437
He said her English
was very good.

56:21.514 --> 56:22.913
The record company called,

56:22.983 --> 56:25.611
and they're going to sue
if we don't sing.

56:25.685 --> 56:27.016
What?

56:27.087 --> 56:29.078
So, they're
gonna make you sing?

56:29.155 --> 56:30.816
I-I mean, us sing?

56:30.890 --> 56:33.085
Don't worry, carina,
I'll make this work.

56:33.159 --> 56:34.251
Look.

56:51.611 --> 56:52.600
Ah!

56:53.713 --> 56:57.046
Look, Paolo, I-I don't think
this is going to work.

56:57.117 --> 56:59.677
I cannot sing
in front of an audience.

56:59.753 --> 57:02.654
I won't even let my mom
hear me sing in the shower.

57:02.722 --> 57:04.849
I will teach you
all you need to know.

57:04.924 --> 57:06.084
Okay.

57:06.159 --> 57:09.492
So, what is lsabella gonna do
when she sees me being her?

57:09.562 --> 57:13.089
She won't. She's off on some
island trying to get over this.

57:13.166 --> 57:15.191
Come on.

57:22.242 --> 57:23.869
Here's my vow to you.

57:23.943 --> 57:25.376
I, Paolo Valisari,

57:25.445 --> 57:28.380
will never let you,
Lizzie McGuire, be embarrassed.

57:28.448 --> 57:31.042
If I fail,
I have to spend seven days

57:31.117 --> 57:33.517
with that scary
head-check woman.

57:33.586 --> 57:36.817
Her name's Miss Ungermeyer.

57:36.890 --> 57:40.553
Carina, hasn't everything
I've promised you come to be?

57:40.627 --> 57:42.561
Everyone believes
you are lsabella.

57:42.629 --> 57:44.688
You're having
the time of your life.

57:44.764 --> 57:46.698
You even told
Franca di Montecatini

57:46.766 --> 57:47.755
to buzz off!

57:49.002 --> 57:52.938
Don't you trust that we can
do the singing together?

57:56.042 --> 57:57.600
I guess.

57:57.677 --> 57:58.837
Well, you shouldn't.

58:03.083 --> 58:08.316
Hmmm-mmmm

58:08.388 --> 58:10.618
Ohhh

58:10.690 --> 58:13.523
Ye-e-e-ah

58:13.593 --> 58:18.155
You've been searching the
world to find true love

58:18.231 --> 58:21.723
Looking in all
the wrong places

58:21.801 --> 58:25.862
When all of the time,
you've been blind to love

58:25.939 --> 58:29.602
It's plain as the nose
on your face is

58:29.676 --> 58:31.667
It's here

58:31.745 --> 58:34.009
It's now

58:34.080 --> 58:37.345
Open your eyes and see it

58:37.417 --> 58:39.544
Right here

58:39.619 --> 58:40.608
Right now

58:40.687 --> 58:41.847
Ohh

58:41.921 --> 58:44.389
This is so beautiful.

58:44.457 --> 58:45.947
Yes, you are.

58:46.025 --> 58:47.253
Ohhhh

58:47.327 --> 58:51.093
Love has been
right by your side

58:51.164 --> 58:55.624
Oh, so close,
that you couldn't see

58:55.702 --> 58:59.604
If love could speak,
it would shout to the sky

58:59.672 --> 59:04.166
"I've always been here,
I always will be"

59:04.244 --> 59:05.734
Wow!

59:05.812 --> 59:07.177
I'm here

59:07.247 --> 59:08.179
I'm here

59:08.248 --> 59:09.272
I'm now

59:09.349 --> 59:10.475
I'm now

59:10.550 --> 59:14.042
Open your eyes and see

59:14.120 --> 59:16.315
Right here

59:16.389 --> 59:18.584
Right now

59:18.658 --> 59:24.961
Open your eyes to love

59:25.031 --> 59:27.261
Open your heart

59:27.333 --> 59:31.326
To love

59:47.954 --> 59:49.478
Hey.

59:49.556 --> 59:51.456
What do you got there,
little man?

59:51.524 --> 59:53.219
- Uh, nothing.
- What's this?

59:53.293 --> 59:54.817
Uh, that's not Lizzie!
No!

59:54.895 --> 59:56.419
- Yes, it is.
- No, it isn't.

59:56.496 --> 59:59.056
I know my daughter.
I gave her that necklace.

59:59.132 --> 01:00:01.965
All right, tell me
what you know that I don't.

01:00:02.035 --> 01:00:05.266
It's only
a 14-hour flight, Dad.

01:00:10.810 --> 01:00:12.243
Swallow those biscotti.

01:00:12.312 --> 01:00:15.179
We got a big day.
The Pantheon, the Colosseum.

01:00:15.248 --> 01:00:16.180
Oh.

01:00:16.249 --> 01:00:17.773
Uh, halt!

01:00:17.851 --> 01:00:20.285
Got to get these apricots
to McGuire.

01:00:20.353 --> 01:00:22.878
She looked sick as a dog
this morning.

01:00:23.957 --> 01:00:25.788
Mr. Gordon,
you having a problem?

01:00:25.859 --> 01:00:27.087
N-No, I just...

01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:29.094
I'm starting to agree
with Ethan.

01:00:29.162 --> 01:00:31.687
- We need to eat more spaghetti.
- You da man!

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.858
Sorry.

01:00:34.935 --> 01:00:38.063
Is there a reason you
don't want me to go upstairs?

01:00:38.138 --> 01:00:40.902
No, I-I just really think
we should get going.

01:00:40.974 --> 01:00:44.102
Uh, so much Roma,
so little time-a.

01:00:44.177 --> 01:00:46.202
Well, when I get upstairs -

01:00:46.279 --> 01:00:49.180
and I will get upstairs -

01:00:49.249 --> 01:00:51.877
I expect to find Miss McGuire
in her bed.

01:00:53.186 --> 01:00:56.121
She may be in the bathroom
or - or something.

01:00:56.189 --> 01:00:58.180
I'm beginning
to get the feeling

01:00:58.258 --> 01:01:01.056
she was never sick
to begin with.

01:01:01.127 --> 01:01:02.719
No, no, no!
She - She was!

01:01:02.796 --> 01:01:05.060
I bet this whole thing
was just a clever ruse

01:01:05.131 --> 01:01:08.066
to sneak out of this hotel,
wasn't it?

01:01:09.302 --> 01:01:11.236
Yeah, it - it was.

01:01:11.304 --> 01:01:12.601
It was?

01:01:12.672 --> 01:01:16.233
Well, Lizzie and I were
talking about adventures,

01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:17.401
and I don't know.

01:01:17.477 --> 01:01:19.069
Ah, spit it out, Gordon.

01:01:19.145 --> 01:01:21.739
Lizzie's upstairs.
It - It's me.

01:01:21.815 --> 01:01:23.806
I'm the one
who's been sneaking out.

01:01:23.883 --> 01:01:25.748
- You?
- But - But -

01:01:26.553 --> 01:01:29.386
Feels good
to get it off my chest.

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:32.190
You realize
what this means?

01:01:33.193 --> 01:01:37.186
I shouldn't look to you
for a college recommendation?

01:01:37.263 --> 01:01:40.164
You should look
for your suitcase, Gordon.

01:01:40.233 --> 01:01:41.495
You're goin' home.

01:01:41.568 --> 01:01:44.503
Oh, I pegged you
right from the start.

01:01:44.571 --> 01:01:45.799
David Gordon.

01:01:45.872 --> 01:01:48.864
Sneaky little brownnoser
with a hidden agenda.

01:01:49.876 --> 01:01:51.707
Well, you're busted.

01:01:56.182 --> 01:01:58.946
Love lifts us up
where we belong.

01:02:09.696 --> 01:02:12.392
Wow.
This place is so cool.

01:02:12.465 --> 01:02:13.625
Si,

01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:15.634
Are you sure it's okay
we're here?

01:02:15.702 --> 01:02:16.669
Si,

01:02:16.736 --> 01:02:19.000
And here is where, exactly?

01:02:19.072 --> 01:02:20.471
It's the rehearsal hall.

01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:23.134
But the Colosseum
will look more like this.

01:02:23.209 --> 01:02:24.267
Sergei!

01:02:30.283 --> 01:02:32.683
If you want to convince
the world you're lsabella,

01:02:32.752 --> 01:02:34.117
you must take the stage.

01:02:34.187 --> 01:02:35.279
You must dance...

01:02:38.958 --> 01:02:40.391
...and sing.

01:02:43.129 --> 01:02:48.965
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

01:02:49.035 --> 01:02:51.060
Just move your mouth
with the words.

01:02:51.137 --> 01:02:53.401
Oh. So you want me
to lip-synch.

01:02:53.473 --> 01:02:54.599
- Si,

01:02:54.674 --> 01:02:55.834
Just like lsabella.

01:02:55.909 --> 01:02:57.570
You know the song, right?

01:02:57.644 --> 01:03:01.045
Uh, well, yeah.
I mean, I have your CD, but...

01:03:01.114 --> 01:03:03.048
So try it.

01:03:03.116 --> 01:03:04.674
I'm not gonna try it.

01:03:09.522 --> 01:03:11.717
- Okay.

01:03:12.959 --> 01:03:18.955
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

01:03:21.267 --> 01:03:28.196
I could almost kiss the stars
for shining so bright

01:03:31.311 --> 01:03:33.302
Was it awful?

01:03:33.379 --> 01:03:35.609
- Uh, yes.

01:03:35.682 --> 01:03:37.115
But it helps to sing.

01:03:37.183 --> 01:03:39.117
Really - really sing?

01:03:39.185 --> 01:03:41.653
It looks more real
when you're lip-synching.

01:03:41.721 --> 01:03:44.588
- You weren't singing.
- But I won't be lip-synching.

01:03:44.657 --> 01:03:47.785
No one's going to hear you.
The microphone will be off.

01:03:47.861 --> 01:03:49.123
You must try.

01:03:50.029 --> 01:03:51.121
Please?

01:03:52.866 --> 01:03:53.924
Okay.

01:04:00.373 --> 01:04:06.369
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

01:04:08.581 --> 01:04:15.316
I could almost kiss the stars
for shining so bright

01:04:16.990 --> 01:04:19.925
When I see you smiling

01:04:19.993 --> 01:04:24.487
I go, "Oh, oh, oh"

01:04:25.698 --> 01:04:30.135
I would never want
to miss this

01:04:30.203 --> 01:04:35.937
'Cause in my heart
I know what this is

01:04:36.943 --> 01:04:42.779
This is what dreams
are made of

01:04:45.151 --> 01:04:47.119
This is what

01:04:47.187 --> 01:04:49.951
Dreams are made of

01:04:50.023 --> 01:04:51.251
I've got

01:04:51.324 --> 01:04:54.191
Somewhere I belong

01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:55.522
I've got

01:04:55.595 --> 01:04:58.359
Somebody to love

01:04:58.431 --> 01:04:59.398
This is what

01:04:59.465 --> 01:05:03.231
Dreams

01:05:03.303 --> 01:05:07.763
Are made of

01:05:11.444 --> 01:05:13.036
Brava.

01:05:13.112 --> 01:05:14.977
And now we dance!

01:05:21.854 --> 01:05:22.843
Hey!

01:05:29.329 --> 01:05:30.819
Hey!

01:05:37.370 --> 01:05:38.428
Hey!

01:05:47.947 --> 01:05:50.006
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:05:51.217 --> 01:05:53.048
Hey!

01:05:53.119 --> 01:05:54.450
Hey!

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:55.612
Hey!

01:05:55.688 --> 01:05:58.384
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

01:06:21.114 --> 01:06:22.046
Hey!

01:06:22.115 --> 01:06:24.913
I'm glad you're up.
I had the most amazing night.

01:06:24.985 --> 01:06:27.681
I'm gonna grab Gordo
so I can tell you together.

01:06:27.754 --> 01:06:28.948
You won't find him.

01:06:29.022 --> 01:06:30.751
What?

01:06:30.824 --> 01:06:32.121
Why? Where'd he go?

01:06:32.192 --> 01:06:35.093
Probably getting on a plane
right now.

01:06:35.162 --> 01:06:36.254
Why?

01:06:36.329 --> 01:06:37.819
He totally covered for you

01:06:37.898 --> 01:06:39.957
and got himself
kicked off the trip.

01:06:40.033 --> 01:06:42.126
I-I don't believe it.

01:06:42.202 --> 01:06:43.965
W-Why would he do that?

01:06:44.037 --> 01:06:46.938
You're seriously asking
that question?

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.916
Call the airline and see
if Gordo's plane has left!

01:06:56.983 --> 01:06:59.508
- Do you know what flight?
- Si, si,

01:06:59.586 --> 01:07:01.110
I will call.

01:07:02.122 --> 01:07:04.590
I cannot believe Gordo
would do this for me.

01:07:04.658 --> 01:07:06.319
Maybe he's not
on the plane yet.

01:07:06.393 --> 01:07:08.725
Maybe I could go
to the airport and...

01:07:08.795 --> 01:07:10.126
And what?

01:07:11.698 --> 01:07:13.393
I don't know.

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:16.060
I am now on hold.

01:07:16.136 --> 01:07:19.902
This is the final call
for Lufthansa Flight 6240,

01:07:19.973 --> 01:07:23.431
departing for Los Angeles.

01:07:29.382 --> 01:07:30.849
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:07:34.888 --> 01:07:36.981
Mm-hmm.

01:07:37.057 --> 01:07:39.821
Mm-hmm.

01:07:39.893 --> 01:07:41.793
Mm-hmm.

01:07:41.862 --> 01:07:42.920
Mm-hmm.

01:07:42.996 --> 01:07:44.861
Mm-hmm.

01:07:44.931 --> 01:07:46.922
Mm-hmm.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.662
Thank you very nice.

01:07:49.736 --> 01:07:51.169
The plane is gone.

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:26.033
Who is this girl?

01:08:26.106 --> 01:08:27.868
I have been on the island,

01:08:27.941 --> 01:08:30.466
trying to forget
about this whole situation.

01:08:30.544 --> 01:08:32.808
Can somebody tell me
what is going on?

01:08:32.879 --> 01:08:35.676
I can. That's my friend
Lizzie McGuire.

01:08:38.585 --> 01:08:39.846
Let him go.
Let him go.

01:08:39.920 --> 01:08:42.286
I demand you tell me
everything you know

01:08:42.354 --> 01:08:43.515
about Lizzie McGuire.

01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:48.050
I demand you tell me everything
about Paolo Valisari.

01:08:48.127 --> 01:08:51.120
I left him and all thoughts
about him on the island.

01:08:51.198 --> 01:08:53.189
You may have left him
on the island,

01:08:53.265 --> 01:08:55.393
but Lizzie is out there
pretending to be you

01:08:55.468 --> 01:08:57.095
so you don't get sued.

01:08:58.971 --> 01:09:00.939
We need to talk in private.

01:09:02.609 --> 01:09:05.339
Gordo's life is ruined
because of me.

01:09:05.412 --> 01:09:07.175
Selfish me!

01:09:07.247 --> 01:09:08.714
What are you gonna do now?

01:09:08.782 --> 01:09:10.545
It's over.

01:09:10.617 --> 01:09:13.346
I'm going to turn myself in
to Miss Ungermeyer.

01:09:14.955 --> 01:09:16.718
Lizzie, you'll get sent home,

01:09:16.790 --> 01:09:18.781
and you won't be able
to help Paolo.

01:09:18.859 --> 01:09:20.451
I'm never going to be able

01:09:20.527 --> 01:09:23.018
to get through this
the way I feel now.

01:09:23.095 --> 01:09:24.859
Okay. Fine. Quit.

01:09:24.930 --> 01:09:27.957
But then everything Gordo did
will be for nothing.

01:09:30.871 --> 01:09:35.638
Now, you know things are bad
when Kate starts making sense.

01:09:35.709 --> 01:09:37.301
I know one thing's for sure.

01:09:37.377 --> 01:09:38.469
What?

01:09:38.545 --> 01:09:40.774
I'm not gonna have to
act sick today.

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:16.813
Mr. Craft, you are in
the most historic

01:10:16.883 --> 01:10:19.078
and beautiful city
in the world.

01:10:19.152 --> 01:10:20.983
Has it had no effect on you?

01:10:21.054 --> 01:10:22.351
Well, actually, it has.

01:10:22.422 --> 01:10:24.720
The cobblestones
are shredding my wheels.

01:10:24.791 --> 01:10:27.316
Switched to a pair
of birdhouse pterodactyls.

01:10:27.394 --> 01:10:30.761
Have you even made a dent
in your reading list?

01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:32.320
I finished it.

01:10:32.399 --> 01:10:34.162
You read 11 books?

01:10:34.234 --> 01:10:36.429
I mean I read the list.

01:10:45.145 --> 01:10:46.442
Shh.

01:10:48.882 --> 01:10:50.281
Shh.

01:10:52.285 --> 01:10:53.718
McGuire.

01:10:53.787 --> 01:10:55.550
Lizzie McGuire.

01:10:55.622 --> 01:10:58.682
Si, si, we are in
the travel guides.

01:10:58.758 --> 01:11:00.020
No. No.

01:11:00.093 --> 01:11:01.583
No.

01:11:02.629 --> 01:11:05.564
We're the parents of Lizzie.

01:11:05.632 --> 01:11:06.894
Ah! Si!

01:11:10.136 --> 01:11:12.400
I'll call a cab.
It's very far.

01:11:12.472 --> 01:11:14.838
Anybody else want to step up
to the plate?

01:11:14.908 --> 01:11:17.172
Who's asking for McGuire?

01:11:17.243 --> 01:11:19.234
I had left you
four messages already,

01:11:19.312 --> 01:11:22.713
but she's been under
my watchful eye all the while.

01:11:22.782 --> 01:11:24.716
Where'd Sanders go?

01:11:24.784 --> 01:11:27.309
Lizzie? Sweetheart?

01:11:27.387 --> 01:11:29.252
Honey?

01:11:30.423 --> 01:11:31.913
Cool!

01:11:36.096 --> 01:11:37.290
Where is Lizzie?

01:11:37.364 --> 01:11:39.332
Do you have
any embarrassing photos

01:11:39.399 --> 01:11:41.526
or videos of her
while she's been here?

01:11:41.601 --> 01:11:42.795
Ow.

01:11:42.869 --> 01:11:43.836
Uh...

01:11:43.903 --> 01:11:47.304
Tell us where Lizzie is,
or this deck's gonna catch air.

01:11:47.374 --> 01:11:50.741
It's possible she's at the
International Music Video Awards

01:11:50.810 --> 01:11:54.109
doubling for pop star lsabella,
who's totally her twin.

01:11:55.115 --> 01:11:58.448
Why does everyone
always look at me like that?

01:12:02.989 --> 01:12:07.255
When you wish upon a star

01:12:07.327 --> 01:12:09.887
Your dreams will take you
very far

01:12:11.765 --> 01:12:14.734
Once you see your light
so clear

01:12:16.603 --> 01:12:21.131
In the sky so very dear

01:12:21.207 --> 01:12:23.198
You're a shining star

01:12:23.276 --> 01:12:25.870
No matter who you are

01:12:25.945 --> 01:12:28.277
Shining bright to see

01:12:28.348 --> 01:12:30.111
What you can truly be

01:12:32.519 --> 01:12:34.111
Prince William?

01:12:34.187 --> 01:12:36.781
Tell him he'll have to hold.

01:12:44.564 --> 01:12:45.656
Ooh!

01:12:45.732 --> 01:12:47.324
- Oh.

01:12:51.171 --> 01:12:54.766
Shine its watchful light
on you

01:12:54.841 --> 01:12:56.741
Hey, Paolo!

01:13:01.314 --> 01:13:04.613
Words of wisdom,
yes, I can

01:13:05.852 --> 01:13:07.945
You're a shining star

01:13:08.021 --> 01:13:10.546
No matter who you are

01:13:10.623 --> 01:13:12.716
Shining bright to see

01:13:12.792 --> 01:13:14.919
What you can truly be

01:13:25.271 --> 01:13:26.238
Si,

01:13:26.306 --> 01:13:27.068
What?

01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:29.267
He said for you to enter
from here, stage right,

01:13:29.342 --> 01:13:32.368
and I must enter
from stage left.

01:13:32.445 --> 01:13:35.107
What about my dress?
I have to get dressed.

01:13:35.181 --> 01:13:36.808
It's in your dressing room.

01:13:36.883 --> 01:13:39.181
Lizzie, you have time.

01:13:39.252 --> 01:13:40.913
Calm down.
You can do it.

01:13:41.921 --> 01:13:43.752
Of course I can do it.

01:13:44.757 --> 01:13:47.021
This is moi
we're talking about.

01:13:47.093 --> 01:13:48.856
I don't think I can do it.

01:13:48.928 --> 01:13:50.361
Lizzie, you must.

01:13:50.430 --> 01:13:53.422
We've rehearsed this.
You know the steps, the words.

01:13:53.533 --> 01:13:56.127
You will be great.
I know.

01:13:56.202 --> 01:13:57.499
How do you know?

01:13:57.570 --> 01:13:59.765
Because.

01:13:59.839 --> 01:14:02.569
Because you shine
like the light from the sun.

01:14:08.214 --> 01:14:10.182
Paolo. Paolo.

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:13.413
31 minutes till showtime.

01:14:15.321 --> 01:14:16.754
Lizzie.

01:14:16.823 --> 01:14:19.087
Gordo!
What are you doing here?!

01:14:19.159 --> 01:14:21.855
Lizzie, that's
not important right now.

01:14:21.928 --> 01:14:23.555
You need to listen to me.

01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:27.066
I feel so bad. I cannot believe
you would do that for me.

01:14:27.133 --> 01:14:29.033
- Why aren't you gone?
- Long story.

01:14:29.102 --> 01:14:32.094
I want to hear it, but
I've got to get my dress on.

01:14:32.172 --> 01:14:33.104
Listen to me.

01:14:33.173 --> 01:14:35.403
Paolo is setting you up.

01:14:36.609 --> 01:14:38.372
What are you talking about?

01:14:38.444 --> 01:14:41.038
Actually, he is setting me up.

01:14:47.053 --> 01:14:48.645
Freaky, huh?

01:14:48.721 --> 01:14:50.552
Way freaky.

01:14:50.623 --> 01:14:52.921
Way, way freaky.

01:14:52.992 --> 01:14:55.825
That whole story
about Paolo doing his own music

01:14:55.895 --> 01:14:57.123
and going solo.

01:14:57.197 --> 01:14:58.528
That's lsabella.

01:14:58.598 --> 01:15:00.361
She's the one that sings live.

01:15:00.433 --> 01:15:03.231
Paolo is the one
that lip-synchs, not me.

01:15:03.303 --> 01:15:05.533
Isabella wants to quit the act.

01:15:05.605 --> 01:15:06.902
Paolo is just a liar.

01:15:06.973 --> 01:15:09.441
This has all been some scheme
to set you up

01:15:09.509 --> 01:15:10.908
and embarrass you onstage

01:15:10.977 --> 01:15:13.036
so it looks
like lsabella can't sing.

01:15:13.112 --> 01:15:14.602
Si, si, It's true.

01:15:14.681 --> 01:15:17.047
Paolo wants to destroy
lsabella's career.

01:15:18.518 --> 01:15:22.079
But Paolo would never
do that to me.

01:15:22.155 --> 01:15:23.417
I don't believe you.

01:15:25.024 --> 01:15:26.457
Isabella...

01:15:30.463 --> 01:15:32.954
Lizzie, who are you
going to believe,

01:15:33.032 --> 01:15:35.262
this boy you are knowing
your whole life

01:15:35.335 --> 01:15:39.294
or this boy you are
just meeting who says,

01:15:39.372 --> 01:15:41.670
"You shine with the light
from the sun"?

01:16:15.408 --> 01:16:18.400
Okay. Well, then, you're here
now, so go and sing.

01:16:18.478 --> 01:16:21.413
But I am not blond.
Paolo will know that it's me,

01:16:21.481 --> 01:16:23.608
and he'll make an excuse
to leave.

01:16:23.683 --> 01:16:25.674
But if we want to
get back at him

01:16:25.752 --> 01:16:28.016
in front of the whole world
on live TV,

01:16:28.087 --> 01:16:29.349
we must make him sing.

01:16:29.422 --> 01:16:31.390
And really sing, not lip-synch.

01:16:31.457 --> 01:16:33.152
How? What am I
supposed to do?

01:16:33.226 --> 01:16:36.286
- I can't sing live!

01:16:36.362 --> 01:16:37.920
Change! Change!

01:16:37.997 --> 01:16:39.055
Change your clothes

01:16:39.132 --> 01:16:41.464
and go up there and do
what you rehearsed.

01:16:41.534 --> 01:16:43.661
Everything will be fine,
I-I promise.

01:16:43.736 --> 01:16:45.636
- I have a plan.
- What plan?

01:16:45.705 --> 01:16:47.434
28 minutes till showtime.

01:16:47.507 --> 01:16:49.441
So, what's the plan?

01:16:49.509 --> 01:16:50.737
I don't know.

01:16:52.312 --> 01:16:54.872
No, see, it doesn't matter
about the tickets,

01:16:54.947 --> 01:16:57.279
because my daughter
is back there

01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:59.113
impersonating
a famous pop star,

01:16:59.185 --> 01:17:00.447
so I got to get in!

01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:02.010
That's what everyone says.

01:17:02.088 --> 01:17:03.020
Enough of this!

01:17:07.093 --> 01:17:08.185
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

01:17:08.261 --> 01:17:09.694
Let's go!

01:17:12.965 --> 01:17:15.525
Did Paolo bring
the voice track for me?

01:17:15.601 --> 01:17:18.069
No. No, he did not.
There is no track.

01:17:18.137 --> 01:17:21.231
Paolo says you're gonna sing
live, like you always do.

01:17:22.975 --> 01:17:26.172
Paolo and lsabella!

01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:39.690
Sandro, turn down
lsabella's mike.

01:17:39.759 --> 01:17:41.693
- What's that?
- Turn down the mike!

01:17:51.270 --> 01:17:57.266
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

01:17:59.712 --> 01:18:05.309
I could almost kiss the stars
for shining so bright

01:18:08.121 --> 01:18:11.887
When I see you smiling,
I go

01:18:11.958 --> 01:18:14.791
"Oh, oh, oh"

01:18:16.295 --> 01:18:20.391
I would never want
to miss this

01:18:20.466 --> 01:18:22.457
'Cause in my heart

01:18:22.535 --> 01:18:24.628
I know what this is

01:18:27.540 --> 01:18:32.978
This is what dreams
are made of

01:18:33.045 --> 01:18:34.842
Sing to me, Paolo.

01:18:36.249 --> 01:18:41.186
This is
what dreams are made of

01:18:59.272 --> 01:19:01.001
Okay.

01:19:02.542 --> 01:19:06.273
Say buonasera to my new American
friend, Lizzie McGuire!

01:19:07.713 --> 01:19:09.840
Paolo tried to use her
to fool all of you

01:19:09.916 --> 01:19:11.713
into thinking I could not sing.

01:19:11.784 --> 01:19:14.480
Lizzie McGuire is nice girl.
You try to hurt her.

01:19:14.554 --> 01:19:16.681
Let me go, Sergei.
You work for me.

01:19:16.756 --> 01:19:18.883
Not anymore, Paolo.
I quit.

01:19:18.958 --> 01:19:19.890
Paolo!

01:19:21.194 --> 01:19:25.221
Paolo cannot sing music.
Now he must face music.

01:19:25.298 --> 01:19:27.698
- Was it all a lie?
- No, it's just...

01:19:27.767 --> 01:19:30.861
- Do you want to hear us sing?

01:19:41.047 --> 01:19:46.485
Have you ever seen
such a beautiful night?

01:19:48.721 --> 01:19:54.523
I could almost kiss the stars
for shining so bright

01:19:55.895 --> 01:20:00.229
When I see you smiling,
I go

01:20:00.299 --> 01:20:03.427
"Oh, oh, oh"

01:20:03.503 --> 01:20:07.940
I would never want
to miss this

01:20:08.007 --> 01:20:11.408
'Cause in my heart
I know what this is

01:20:11.477 --> 01:20:12.603
Hey, now

01:20:12.678 --> 01:20:14.111
Hey, now

01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:18.947
This is what dreams
are made of

01:20:19.018 --> 01:20:20.110
Hey, now

01:20:20.186 --> 01:20:21.517
Hey, now

01:20:21.587 --> 01:20:25.546
This is what dreams
are made of

01:20:25.625 --> 01:20:29.288
I've got
somewhere I belong

01:20:29.362 --> 01:20:33.059
I've got
somebody to love

01:20:33.132 --> 01:20:36.898
This is what dre-e-e-ams

01:20:36.969 --> 01:20:39.597
Are made of

01:20:41.507 --> 01:20:42.974
Wait! Isabella!

01:20:43.042 --> 01:20:44.236
Go! Si!

01:20:46.612 --> 01:20:47.772
Lizzie!

01:20:50.883 --> 01:20:52.748
Ru-u-u-u-n!

01:20:59.492 --> 01:21:01.687
Hey, hey, hey!

01:21:01.761 --> 01:21:07.427
Have you ever wondered
what life is about?

01:21:09.602 --> 01:21:15.097
You could search the world
and never figure it out

01:21:16.909 --> 01:21:20.504
You don't have to sail
the oceans

01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:23.344
No, no, no

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:27.344
Happiness is no mystery

01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:29.752
It's here and now

01:21:29.822 --> 01:21:32.450
It's you and me, yeah

01:21:34.193 --> 01:21:36.593
Hey, now, hey, now

01:21:36.662 --> 01:21:40.689
This is what dreams
are made of

01:21:41.667 --> 01:21:43.965
Hey, now, hey, now

01:21:44.036 --> 01:21:47.938
This is what dreams
are made of

01:21:48.007 --> 01:21:51.534
I've got somewhere I belong

01:21:51.611 --> 01:21:55.308
I've got somebody to love

01:21:55.381 --> 01:21:59.147
This is what dre-e-e-ams

01:21:59.218 --> 01:22:01.209
Are made of

01:22:01.287 --> 01:22:02.811
Hey, now

01:22:02.888 --> 01:22:06.221
This is what dreams
are made of

01:22:06.292 --> 01:22:07.850
Hey, hey, hey, hey

01:22:07.927 --> 01:22:08.916
Hey, now

01:22:08.995 --> 01:22:10.826
Hey, now

01:22:10.896 --> 01:22:14.992
This is what dreams
are made of

01:22:15.768 --> 01:22:18.168
Open your eyes

01:22:18.237 --> 01:22:22.230
This is what dreams
are made of

01:22:23.042 --> 01:22:25.602
Shout to the skies

01:22:25.678 --> 01:22:28.203
This is what dreams
are made of

01:22:28.280 --> 01:22:30.305
Hey, hey, hey, hey

01:22:30.383 --> 01:22:32.442
Then I see you smile

01:22:32.518 --> 01:22:37.046
And I go, "Oh, oh, oh"

01:22:38.290 --> 01:22:41.748
Yesterday
my life was duller

01:22:41.827 --> 01:22:45.593
Now everything
is technicolor

01:22:49.402 --> 01:22:51.666
Hey, now, hey, now

01:22:51.737 --> 01:22:55.673
This is what dreams
are made of

01:22:57.510 --> 01:22:59.535
Hey, now, hey, now

01:22:59.578 --> 01:23:03.674
This is what dreams
are made of

01:23:03.749 --> 01:23:06.980
I've got somewhere I belong

01:23:07.053 --> 01:23:11.149
I've got somebody to love

01:23:11.223 --> 01:23:15.717
This is what dre-e-e-ams

01:23:15.795 --> 01:23:18.855
Dre-e-e-ams

01:23:18.931 --> 01:23:22.423
This is what dre-e-e-ams

01:23:22.501 --> 01:23:23.593
Are made of

01:23:23.669 --> 01:23:25.102
Hey, now, hey, now

01:23:25.171 --> 01:23:27.139
Hey, hey, hey, hey

01:23:27.206 --> 01:23:28.969
Hey, now, hey, now

01:23:29.041 --> 01:23:31.236
Hey, hey, hey, hey

01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:32.902
Hey, now, hey, now

01:23:32.978 --> 01:23:35.139
Hey, hey, hey, hey

01:23:35.214 --> 01:23:36.647
Hey, now, hey, now

01:23:36.716 --> 01:23:38.616
Hey, hey, hey, hey

01:23:38.684 --> 01:23:39.708
Hey!

01:24:38.377 --> 01:24:40.845
Lizzie got everything
you're supposed to get

01:24:40.913 --> 01:24:42.471
when you go to Europe.

01:24:42.548 --> 01:24:44.982
Adventure, romance,
total confidence.

01:24:45.050 --> 01:24:46.176
Yeah?

01:24:46.251 --> 01:24:50.017
Well, if all that can happen
to Lizzie McGuire,

01:24:50.088 --> 01:24:54.218
the only thing I know now is
I don't know anything.

01:24:54.293 --> 01:24:55.885
That's hot.

01:24:55.961 --> 01:24:57.428
What?

01:24:57.496 --> 01:25:00.897
Girls who think they know
everything are just a turnoff.

01:25:02.334 --> 01:25:03.460
Really?

01:25:03.535 --> 01:25:05.059
Oh, totally.

01:25:05.137 --> 01:25:07.332
What about you
not ratting out Lizzie?

01:25:07.406 --> 01:25:11.467
I mean,
that was just so...

01:25:11.543 --> 01:25:12.874
not you.

01:25:27.392 --> 01:25:28.586
That's good.

01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:29.592
Si,

01:25:29.661 --> 01:25:31.492
Aaaaaaah!

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:36.966
Mom, Dad, I'm so glad
that you guys made it.

01:25:37.035 --> 01:25:38.696
You would have never
believed me.

01:25:38.770 --> 01:25:39.759
That is for sure.

01:25:39.838 --> 01:25:43.296
I thought after you found out
all I did, I would be grounded.

01:25:43.375 --> 01:25:46.208
You're grounded for the rest
of the summer, sweetheart,

01:25:46.278 --> 01:25:48.212
but we're really proud of you.

01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:54.810
Lying, even for a good reason,
is beneath you, Gordon.

01:25:54.887 --> 01:25:56.320
Yeah. I know. I know.

01:25:56.388 --> 01:25:59.255
I'm a lying, spineless,
brownnosing jellyfish

01:25:59.324 --> 01:26:00.552
with a hidden agenda.

01:26:00.626 --> 01:26:01.593
I got it.

01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:04.254
That may be true,
but I'll tell you something.

01:26:04.329 --> 01:26:06.354
Little Miss Diva
told me everything.

01:26:06.465 --> 01:26:09.866
The way I see it, you're
a pretty loyal friend, Gordon.

01:26:09.935 --> 01:26:12.927
And loyalty goes a long way
with the Ungermeyer.

01:26:13.005 --> 01:26:14.097
- Hmm?
- Thanks.

01:26:19.211 --> 01:26:20.701
Hey, just think about it.

01:26:20.779 --> 01:26:24.078
We got 4 years of high school
to look forward to together.

01:26:24.149 --> 01:26:25.446
Ooh. Sammies.

01:26:27.686 --> 01:26:29.119
Sergei is hungry.

01:26:29.187 --> 01:26:31.519
So is Miss Ungermeyer.

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:36.494
You are strong woman.

01:26:36.562 --> 01:26:39.656
You protect cubs like lioness.

01:26:39.731 --> 01:26:41.426
Sergei is impressed.

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.765
Hmm. You're still on my list.

01:26:44.836 --> 01:26:46.861
As long as I am at the top.

01:26:49.341 --> 01:26:50.933
Hey, there!

01:26:51.009 --> 01:26:54.137
I bet you're wondering,
who is this Lizzie McGuire,

01:26:54.212 --> 01:26:55.543
where did she come from,

01:26:55.614 --> 01:26:58.242
and what are her
most embarrassing moments?

01:26:58.317 --> 01:27:02.777
Well, I can give you
total access to all of that

01:27:02.854 --> 01:27:05.448
for a very competitive price.

01:27:05.524 --> 01:27:07.424
Hmm. When in Rome...

01:27:07.492 --> 01:27:10.017
Yeah, yeah.
Do as the Romans do, right?

01:27:10.095 --> 01:27:11.027
No.

01:27:11.096 --> 01:27:13.826
We do not blackmail
our sisters.

01:27:13.899 --> 01:27:16.459
As a former commander
in the ltalian Navy,

01:27:16.535 --> 01:27:19.698
I am ordering you
to leave the country.

01:27:19.771 --> 01:27:20.760
No!

01:27:28.580 --> 01:27:29.911
Hey.

01:27:32.618 --> 01:27:37.055
So, one last sneak-away
for old times' sake?

01:27:37.122 --> 01:27:38.555
Yeah. Sounds good.

01:27:38.624 --> 01:27:40.558
Okay.

01:27:42.561 --> 01:27:43.493
Aha.

01:27:43.562 --> 01:27:45.655
No!

01:27:51.903 --> 01:27:53.996
So, are you gonna miss it here?

01:27:54.072 --> 01:27:55.164
I don't know.

01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:58.368
Kate says I should stay
and have my stuff shipped over,

01:27:58.443 --> 01:28:01.037
because when I leave,
it'll never be the same.

01:28:01.112 --> 01:28:02.409
She's wrong, as usual.

01:28:02.481 --> 01:28:05.314
You didn't have to be in Rome
for all this to happen.

01:28:05.383 --> 01:28:06.941
You think?

01:28:07.018 --> 01:28:08.349
Trust me.

01:28:08.420 --> 01:28:10.513
You had it in you
the whole time.

01:28:15.026 --> 01:28:16.960
Gordo?

01:28:17.028 --> 01:28:18.518
What?

01:28:24.970 --> 01:28:26.562
Thanks.

01:28:26.638 --> 01:28:28.799
You're welcome.

01:28:32.511 --> 01:28:33.443
Yeah.

01:28:33.512 --> 01:28:36.413
So, um, want to get back
to that party

01:28:36.481 --> 01:28:38.472
so we don't get
in any more trouble?

01:28:38.550 --> 01:28:40.780
Yeah. I can't afford
any more trouble.

01:28:40.852 --> 01:28:42.012
Yeah.

01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:21.782
Why not?

01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:23.623
Think you're goin' nowhere

01:29:23.695 --> 01:29:25.993
When you're walkin'
down the street

01:29:26.064 --> 01:29:28.055
Acting like
you just don't care

01:29:28.133 --> 01:29:29.828
When life can be so sweet

01:29:29.901 --> 01:29:32.028
But why you want to be
like that

01:29:32.103 --> 01:29:33.866
As if there's nothing new?

01:29:33.939 --> 01:29:35.634
You're not foolin' no one

01:29:35.707 --> 01:29:37.800
You're not even foolin' you

01:29:37.876 --> 01:29:41.869
So walk a little slower
and open up your eyes

01:29:41.947 --> 01:29:46.043
Sometimes it's so hard to see
the good things passin' by

01:29:46.117 --> 01:29:49.883
And there may never be a
sign, no flashing neon light

01:29:49.955 --> 01:29:53.982
Telling you to make your move
when the time is right

01:29:54.059 --> 01:29:56.254
Why not

01:29:56.328 --> 01:29:58.091
Take a crazy chance?

01:29:58.163 --> 01:30:00.290
Why not

01:30:00.365 --> 01:30:02.128
Do a crazy dance?

01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:05.966
If you lose the moment,
you might lose a lot

01:30:06.037 --> 01:30:08.301
So why not?

01:30:08.373 --> 01:30:10.307
Why not?

01:30:10.375 --> 01:30:14.368
Oh, I could be
the one for you

01:30:14.446 --> 01:30:18.382
Oh, yeah,
maybe yes, maybe no

01:30:18.450 --> 01:30:22.716
Oh, it could be
the thing to do

01:30:22.787 --> 01:30:26.883
What I'm sayin' is you got to
let me know, oh, oh

01:30:26.958 --> 01:30:28.220
Ah, ah, yeah

01:30:28.293 --> 01:30:29.726
Ah, ah, ah

01:30:29.794 --> 01:30:33.025
Yeah, yeah

01:30:34.633 --> 01:30:36.396
Ah, ah, ah, yeah

01:30:36.468 --> 01:30:37.560
Ah, yeah

01:30:37.636 --> 01:30:40.969
Ah, yeah, yeah

01:30:42.474 --> 01:30:46.410
You'll never get to heaven
or even to L,A,

01:30:46.478 --> 01:30:50.744
If you don't believe
there's a way

01:30:50.815 --> 01:30:52.749
Why not

01:30:52.817 --> 01:30:54.751
Take a star from the sky?

01:30:54.819 --> 01:30:56.810
Why not

01:30:56.888 --> 01:30:58.822
Spread your wings and fly?

01:30:58.890 --> 01:31:02.553
It might take a little,
and it might take a lot

01:31:02.627 --> 01:31:04.720
But why not?

01:31:04.796 --> 01:31:06.730
Why not?

01:31:06.798 --> 01:31:09.062
Why not

01:31:09.134 --> 01:31:10.726
Take a crazy chance?

01:31:10.802 --> 01:31:12.861
Why not

01:31:12.937 --> 01:31:14.700
Do a crazy dance?

01:31:14.773 --> 01:31:18.675
If you lose the moment,
you might lose a lot

01:31:18.743 --> 01:31:21.007
So why not?

01:31:21.079 --> 01:31:23.411
Why not?

01:31:27.852 --> 01:31:31.481
Hmmmmmm, mmmm, mmmm

01:31:32.824 --> 01:31:37.557
Ohhhhh, yeah

01:31:37.629 --> 01:31:39.722
You've been searching
the world

01:31:39.798 --> 01:31:41.891
To find true love

01:31:41.966 --> 01:31:45.902
Looking in all
the wrong places

01:31:45.970 --> 01:31:49.906
When all of the time,
you've been blind to love

01:31:49.974 --> 01:31:53.740
It's plain as the nose
on your face is

01:31:53.812 --> 01:31:58.078
It's here, it's now

01:31:58.149 --> 01:32:01.585
Open your eyes and see it

01:32:01.653 --> 01:32:06.090
Right here, right now

01:32:06.157 --> 01:32:11.823
Open your eyes to love

01:32:11.896 --> 01:32:15.889
You've been down on yourself,
thinking something's wrong

01:32:15.967 --> 01:32:19.596
Wondering why love
has never found you

01:32:19.671 --> 01:32:23.767
Don't you know it's been
right here all along

01:32:23.842 --> 01:32:27.676
If only you'd look
around you?

01:32:27.746 --> 01:32:29.771
It's here

01:32:29.848 --> 01:32:32.112
It's now

01:32:32.183 --> 01:32:35.619
Open your eyes and see it

01:32:35.687 --> 01:32:37.814
Right here

01:32:37.889 --> 01:32:38.913
Right now

01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:40.287
Right now

01:32:40.358 --> 01:32:45.455
Open your eyes to love

01:32:45.530 --> 01:32:49.125
Love has been
right by your side

01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:53.637
Oh, so close
that you couldn't see

01:32:53.705 --> 01:32:57.801
If love could speak,
it would shout to the sky

01:32:57.876 --> 01:32:59.969
"I've always been here

01:33:00.044 --> 01:33:03.810
I always will be"

01:33:03.882 --> 01:33:06.077
I'm here

01:33:06.151 --> 01:33:07.413
I'm now

01:33:07.552 --> 01:33:08.484
I'm now

01:33:08.553 --> 01:33:12.148
Open your eyes and see me

01:33:12.223 --> 01:33:13.281
Right here

01:33:13.358 --> 01:33:14.347
Right here

01:33:14.425 --> 01:33:15.619
Right now

01:33:15.693 --> 01:33:16.819
Right now

01:33:16.895 --> 01:33:21.730
Open your eyes to love

01:33:22.901 --> 01:33:27.270
Open your mind to love

01:33:29.073 --> 01:33:36.172
Open your heart to love

01:33:36.247 --> 01:33:42.652
Ooh, ooh, ooh
