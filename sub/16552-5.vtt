WEBVTT

00:05.964 --> 00:07.966
<i>Thanks for tuning in today.</i>
<i>I'm Niala Boodhoo,</i>

00:08.050 --> 00:09.301
<i>and my guest is Jacob Malco.</i>

00:09.384 --> 00:11.220
<i>He's the creator of three graphic novels.</i>

00:11.303 --> 00:14.223
<i>His newest,</i> Obscurity, <i>is just out.</i>

00:14.306 --> 00:17.726
Jacob, when you look at what happened
between your first book, <i>Conjugality,</i>

00:17.809 --> 00:20.312
being such a success,
being made into a movie,

00:20.395 --> 00:22.439
following that up with <i>Infidelity,</i>

00:22.522 --> 00:25.776
and the actual infidelity
that happened in your life,

00:25.859 --> 00:29.238
I wonder how you feel like
that affected your work.

00:29.321 --> 00:33.242
Yeah, the love story of <i>Conjugality</i>
was... was compelling and sweet,

00:33.325 --> 00:35.369
and it... and it was real.
It was a real thing.

00:35.452 --> 00:38.705
And meeting somebody else...

00:38.789 --> 00:41.917
I don't know how that happens,
but it happens to a lot of people,

00:42.000 --> 00:45.337
I'm not unusual in that,
and the infidelity was what it was,

00:45.420 --> 00:47.506
but I did honor that love.

00:47.589 --> 00:51.093
Yeah, I left my first wife,
and I went with somebody else,

00:51.176 --> 00:52.803
but that's, you know, that happens,
you know, so--

00:52.886 --> 00:55.973
Well, I think it happens.
I think most people don't write about it,

00:56.056 --> 00:59.393
so I wonder... And you're talking about
how it affected people.

00:59.476 --> 01:02.437
Do you talk to your first wife
or how did she feel about it?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.439
-I don't talk to either of them.
-So--

01:04.523 --> 01:05.649
I don't... you know, I don't have kids,

01:05.732 --> 01:08.402
so I think that makes it easier
not to talk to them.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.947
It's not really my choice.
Yeah, obviously, you know, the, uh...

01:12.030 --> 01:14.241
the first wife don't want to have
anything to do with me,

01:14.324 --> 01:16.368
and, uh, the second one,
I don't know, you know.

01:16.451 --> 01:20.539
So no feedback on how they've been
portrayed in your works?

01:20.622 --> 01:22.124
Yeah, there's been feedback.

01:22.207 --> 01:26.128
Uh... it's a price you pay,
you know, I mean...

01:26.211 --> 01:28.463
I write about myself.
I don't know, really, how else to do it.

01:28.547 --> 01:31.174
My life is really the... where...
the source of my...

01:31.258 --> 01:33.969
my creativity and what happens
in my life, so...

01:34.052 --> 01:38.015
it's had effect on people in my life,
it does,

01:38.098 --> 01:41.810
and, uh, I mean, I can take responsibility
to a certain degree,

01:41.893 --> 01:45.314
but, uh, I...
I guess they, you know...

01:45.397 --> 01:48.108
Well, they certainly know
goin' in now...

01:48.191 --> 01:50.819
whoever might...
might choose to do that.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.530
Well, and that's what, Jacob, I mean,
that brings us to <i>Obscurity</i> and...

01:53.614 --> 01:56.533
I mean, you have to ask...
I have to ask about the title.

01:56.617 --> 01:59.536
I mean, is that, you think, a reflection
of where you're at right now?

02:00.829 --> 02:02.873
Well, you know, you...

02:02.956 --> 02:06.960
At some point when you're an artist
of any kind, you know,

02:07.044 --> 02:10.881
you want to be relevant,
so when you feel that slipping away...

02:10.964 --> 02:15.886
it's a little... sad.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.430
and it's a little... frustrating,

02:18.513 --> 02:19.931
and also scary, you know.

02:20.015 --> 02:22.267
So... so, I don't know...

02:24.645 --> 02:26.355
You know, I don't...

02:26.480 --> 02:27.814
What was the question again?

02:34.321 --> 02:35.322
Hi.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.074
-Hey, Angie, what's happenin'?
-Hi, Jacob.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.618
- You look pretty.
- Thank you.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.620
Have you ever, uh,
been to this place before?

02:41.703 --> 02:43.914
Nope. Have you?

02:43.997 --> 02:46.416
Yeah, I love this place.
They have, uh, good pizza,

02:46.500 --> 02:49.044
they make a really good, um, salad.

02:49.127 --> 02:50.754
I don't remember what it's called.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.381
Do you want to take your coat off
and stay a while,

02:52.464 --> 02:53.465
-or what are we--
-No, I don't think so.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.176
I don't...
I think I'm okay with my coat on.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.261
Oh, no.

02:58.345 --> 03:01.932
-What happened? What's happening?
-I read the... I read the comic.

03:02.015 --> 03:04.476
The new book.
You read my book.

03:04.559 --> 03:06.061
-I read your book. Yes.
-Okay.

03:06.144 --> 03:08.480
And how was that? Did you like it?

03:08.563 --> 03:11.358
Of course, I'm, you know, I...

03:11.441 --> 03:13.944
Just so you know,
I would prefer that I wasn't involved

03:14.027 --> 03:16.905
in any future work of yours.

03:16.988 --> 03:19.366
-Okay. I--
-Does that seem fair to you?

03:19.449 --> 03:22.077
No, I understand what you're saying.
I don't... I don't know if it's fair,

03:22.160 --> 03:23.203
if that's the word, but like...

03:23.286 --> 03:25.831
It's kind of...
It's a little negotiable at this point.

03:25.914 --> 03:26.957
It's negotiable.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.375
-I don't have to use you--
-Great.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.128
Just wait. Just hear me out.
I don't have to use your real name.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.046
Oh. Yeah, I just don't--

03:33.130 --> 03:34.464
-How bad is that?
-I don't think that's--

03:34.548 --> 03:35.799
Right?

03:37.050 --> 03:39.803
I... I think this is it.
I think this is it.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.304
I think... I think I need to go.

03:41.388 --> 03:42.472
Okay.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.850
-I need to go.
-All right.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.602
-Good luck with your comics.
-Thank you.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.063
-Good luck.
-Yes. Have a good thing.

03:53.984 --> 03:54.901
Hey.

03:54.985 --> 03:57.362
- Hi.
- Is she coming back?

03:57.446 --> 04:00.115
I don't think she is coming back.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.533
It's okay.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.076
Would you like a menu?

04:03.160 --> 04:05.370
Yeah, I'm hungry.
Just... You can just set it down.

04:05.454 --> 04:07.956
-I'll look at it in a second.
-Okay. I'll be right back.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.833
-Thank you so much.
-Mmm-hmm.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.524
-Hey, handsome.
-Hi.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.650
-Hi.
-How's it goin'?

04:35.734 --> 04:37.778
-It's going good.
-I was lost there.

04:37.861 --> 04:39.362
Mmm-hmm.
Want anything else?

04:39.446 --> 04:43.241
Um, no, I think I'm good.
I'm just gonna drink coffee.

04:43.325 --> 04:44.576
All right, let me know
if you need anything.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.578
-All right. Okay, thanks.
-Okay.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.687
<i>How many people</i>
<i>are in there, man?</i>

05:12.813 --> 05:16.858
It's not full, but, um, the people
that are here are here to see you,

05:16.942 --> 05:20.403
-just so you know. I mean--
-God, I don't get it, man, I don't get it.

05:20.487 --> 05:22.155
Really?

05:22.239 --> 05:25.700
The book just came out. I mean,
I used to be able to fill the auditorium.

05:25.784 --> 05:26.993
I don't get it.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.328
Yeah.

05:28.411 --> 05:31.081
I mean, I know that, like, okay,
it's been, like, a long time

05:31.164 --> 05:33.500
since I put somethin' out
and now I got nobody? I got nobody?

05:33.583 --> 05:35.669
Well, it's not nobody.
There's... there's people here.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.045
There's... I think there's just not...

05:37.128 --> 05:39.631
It's not, as I say, not filled.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.841
-Did you read the book?
-I did, I loved it.

05:41.925 --> 05:44.636
Did you read what <i>The Reader</i>
said about the book?

05:44.719 --> 05:46.471
- Forget the--
- Did you read it?

05:46.555 --> 05:47.847
-I did.
-Did you see?

05:47.931 --> 05:48.932
What is... Who is that guy?

05:49.015 --> 05:50.225
-Who is that guy? Do you--
-Doesn't matter.

05:50.308 --> 05:51.643
-Have you read that guy?
-Here's what you should--

05:51.726 --> 05:52.978
When did...
Let me just ask you a question.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.772
When did snark just take over cultural...

05:55.855 --> 05:57.649
-I mean, who... What are they, 12?
-I don't know.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.317
-Yeah, they're children. I don't--
-I'm sorry, man.

05:59.401 --> 06:00.735
I don't know when that happened,

06:00.819 --> 06:03.446
but also... And don't be mad
at the people who are here

06:03.530 --> 06:05.657
because you're mad at the ones
who didn't show up.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.702
Just remember that. It's not their fault
the other people aren't here.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.412
That's good advice but I don't know
what's gonna happen.

06:10.495 --> 06:11.997
Is there someplace
where I can take my coat off?

06:12.080 --> 06:13.748
-Sure. You can go in my office.
-Where is that?

06:13.832 --> 06:14.958
Um...

06:15.959 --> 06:17.544
just take it downstairs and--

06:17.627 --> 06:19.087
I have to take an elevator?

06:19.170 --> 06:20.505
You don't have to.

06:20.589 --> 06:26.052
"Keen observations and bold poignancy fill
Mr. Malco's most recent novel <i>Obscurity,"</i>

06:26.136 --> 06:28.096
which just came out this week.

06:28.179 --> 06:32.350
"It's also been said Mr. Malco is a writer
who knows how to keep his readers rapt

06:32.434 --> 06:37.022
by recounting episodes of his life
with such specific immediacy

06:37.105 --> 06:38.898
and vivid emotional recall

06:38.982 --> 06:42.444
that we experience his distress
as our own."

06:42.527 --> 06:45.113
Quite a compliment. Uh... "Critics
and readers alike both adore and--"

06:45.196 --> 06:46.197
You know what, Dave, listen.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.868
Dave, Dave, Dave, you know what?
Let's just...

06:50.452 --> 06:51.870
"Often in the same paragraph."

06:51.953 --> 06:53.788
No,
let's just scrap the formality.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.165
I mean, come on.

06:55.248 --> 06:59.502
Uh, hi. Thank you for coming.
Ivan, what's up, buddy?

06:59.586 --> 07:01.838
Justin. Is that Spencer?

07:01.921 --> 07:03.340
Jacob Malco.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.467
Why don't we just, um...

07:05.550 --> 07:08.762
hang out, go somewhere and hang out.
I'll answer questions, I'll talk.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.847
I just... The lack of irony

07:10.931 --> 07:13.183
between this event
and the title of my new book is just

07:13.266 --> 07:14.935
too much for me to handle right now.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.437
Right.
So, uh, can we do that?

07:17.520 --> 07:20.690
More importantly, is, um...

07:20.774 --> 07:23.068
can we just do that,
'cause it's like...

07:23.151 --> 07:25.779
Two questions.
If we do that, can I still get paid,

07:25.862 --> 07:27.739
and can we just do that?

07:27.822 --> 07:31.910
Dave? Can we just go to a...
It would be fun, right?

07:31.993 --> 07:35.830
And I guess we could open this up to, uh,
after the bottles are done,

07:35.914 --> 07:37.832
we could open it to question and answer.

07:37.916 --> 07:39.584
Really?
Are we really gonna do like the--

07:39.668 --> 07:41.586
-Have to do a little something.
-All right, I have a question.

07:41.670 --> 07:43.797
Yes, young lady up front.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.216
-What's... What's your name?
-Uh, Alison.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.300
Hi, Alison.

07:47.384 --> 07:50.220
Yeah, nice to meet you, um, Jacob?
Can I call you...

07:50.303 --> 07:52.973
-Or is that too informal?
-Jacob. Jake is fine.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.350
-Yeah, no, no, no. Uh, it's fine.
-I want to stay to the structure.

07:55.433 --> 07:56.601
- Yeah. No.
- Okay.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.770
- Jake is good. Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

07:58.853 --> 08:00.855
Um, I mean, your first book
is so romantic and...

08:00.939 --> 08:02.232
Yeah.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.984
-Look how that turned out.
-...like, positive. I mean...

08:04.067 --> 08:06.403
-Yeah.
-...was that an honest...

08:07.570 --> 08:09.781
-you know--
-Yeah. I mean...

08:09.864 --> 08:12.617
The question was about the first book
being romantic and positive.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.369
- I'm a romantic, yeah.
- Did you... I...

08:14.452 --> 08:16.204
Yeah, we can hear.

08:16.287 --> 08:17.288
-All right.
-Yeah. Okay.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.833
I just... I'm trying
to honor the format, Dave.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.002
All right.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.170
Can't a guy... All right.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.214
I don't know...

08:26.297 --> 08:28.466
Yeah, it was honest, but, you know, I...

08:28.550 --> 08:29.968
You know,
was I being honest with myself?

08:30.051 --> 08:32.220
I think there's an argument to say no,
because the second book,

08:32.303 --> 08:34.889
I ended up meeting somebody else
so was that love real?

08:34.973 --> 08:39.185
Was that romance real? It was.
Did it ultimately sustain? No.

08:39.269 --> 08:43.189
So, yeah, it was a happy story that...
from a period of my life

08:43.273 --> 08:46.401
that, uh, you know, didn't,
uh, didn't remain.

08:46.484 --> 08:47.902
But, yeah, I think it was honest.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.488
And is, um, is Melanie
in your third book?

08:50.572 --> 08:53.116
Is she in <i>Obscurity</i> or...

08:55.493 --> 08:58.538
She's not even in my phone.

08:58.621 --> 09:01.166
- Ah. Thank you.
- No problem.

09:01.249 --> 09:03.710
- Great. Alexandra, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

09:03.793 --> 09:09.049
So, uh, I am, uh, officially tired
of, uh, talking about myself.

09:09.132 --> 09:10.508
Well, that took a while.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.343
Oh, very clever.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.304
-No, I enjoyed it all.
-Uh-huh. Oh, yeah.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.930
- That's very nice of you.
- That's why I'm here.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.974
You guys,
you're all in graduate school,

09:18.058 --> 09:19.309
you're in the graduate program
over there?

09:19.392 --> 09:21.436
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're artists, right?

09:21.519 --> 09:23.730
-Mmm-hmm.
-And you do, you do...

09:23.813 --> 09:26.274
You're a photographer?
You're photographers.

09:26.357 --> 09:27.609
I do video, motion.

09:27.692 --> 09:30.904
Okay, so you do... you take pictures
of yourself with your phones?

09:30.987 --> 09:34.157
Yeah. Yeah, I'm a...
I use a selfie stick and, um, a phone.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.076
- Last call, all right?
- We're doin' it?

09:36.159 --> 09:37.368
- Are you sure?
- We're all doin' it.

09:37.452 --> 09:38.912
- We're all doin' it.
- It's already last call?

09:38.995 --> 09:40.497
- Four shots.
- Last call. Four shots?

09:40.580 --> 09:41.915
- Yeah. He's payin'.
- What can I get you?

09:41.998 --> 09:43.249
-Really?
-Yeah, we got it.

09:43.333 --> 09:44.542
- Okay.
- This guy's gettin' it.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.252
Four shots? Oh, my God.
He's on the one.

09:46.336 --> 09:47.921
No whiskey? All right, pick.
What's it gonna be?

09:48.004 --> 09:49.005
-Tequila. It's always tequila.
-Tequila.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.507
Tequila shots? Patron?

09:50.590 --> 09:51.633
- Oh, no.
- Yes, thank you.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.009
- You got it.
- To <i>Obscurity.</i>

09:53.093 --> 09:55.220
The book. Not... not real. I...

09:56.596 --> 09:59.474
- Oh, all right.
- Here we go.

09:59.557 --> 10:00.683
Oh.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.060
<i>Hey, Jake,</i>

10:02.143 --> 10:04.646
do you mind if I use your charger?
For my phone, right here?

10:04.729 --> 10:07.232
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, do...
What is... Is it the right kind?

10:07.315 --> 10:08.358
I feel like my phone's old.

10:08.441 --> 10:11.402
Thank God you guys came to that thing.

10:11.486 --> 10:12.487
Right?

10:12.570 --> 10:15.198
Thank you. A toast to you
for showing up at that thing,

10:15.281 --> 10:17.450
- that could have been fuckin' tragic.
- Hmm.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.244
Thank you for, uh,
going through with it.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.495
Yeah. Can you imagine if I was

10:20.578 --> 10:22.080
just sitting there talking
with those dudes--

10:22.163 --> 10:23.790
- Oh, my God.
- There it is.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.209
I think, like, uh, those are
the only few copies available. Uh...

10:26.292 --> 10:27.293
Can we have?

10:27.377 --> 10:28.378
- That's it.
- Can we...

10:28.461 --> 10:30.755
- That's the whole...
- Yes, you can... Yeah, sure, you...

10:30.839 --> 10:33.174
- Hey, it looks beautiful.
- Thank you so much. Mmm-hmm.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.260
You watch things broken down
by movements, right?

10:35.343 --> 10:37.846
Like what we were just talking about,
that's how they break them down.

10:37.929 --> 10:39.472
-Fine.
-Well, we are part of a movement.

10:39.556 --> 10:40.765
What's the movement called?

10:40.849 --> 10:42.851
I mean, it's whatever
you want to call it, but it's...

10:42.934 --> 10:44.769
That doesn't sound like
an organized movement to me.

10:44.853 --> 10:45.937
Doesn't have to be organized.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.522
- Okay, fine.
- Yeah, a lot of movements

10:47.605 --> 10:49.357
haven't been organized.
This isn't political.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.651
-Alexandra?
-Dra.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.903
You're much more
close-minded than I expected.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.990
I thought we would bond over some
of our... our ideas.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.159
Okay, self-portraiture
is different than selfie art.

10:59.242 --> 11:00.743
No, it's not.

11:00.827 --> 11:02.620
This is probably
half of my next book.

11:03.830 --> 11:04.914
- See?
- Is that too much?

11:04.998 --> 11:06.791
You take everything from your life.

11:06.875 --> 11:09.127
Exactly. So you got a problem with that?

11:09.210 --> 11:11.713
-You got a problem with being in the...
-No, we do the exact same thing

11:11.796 --> 11:13.464
-but you, um--
-But what if you were gonna be in the book

11:13.548 --> 11:15.508
and I don't represent you
the way you like?

11:15.592 --> 11:17.135
That's fine by me.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.761
-Really?
-Yeah.

11:18.845 --> 11:20.513
Do you want to spend
the rest of your life with me?

11:20.597 --> 11:22.140
-Maybe.
-Really?

11:22.223 --> 11:23.683
We'll see.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.477
Karen was sweet, I don't,
what am I gonna do to Melanie, probably?

11:26.561 --> 11:28.354
Lots of people
are friends with their exes.

11:28.438 --> 11:31.107
Yeah, that's a generational
thing. I think sometimes--

11:31.190 --> 11:33.568
- I still have sex with my ex.
- Am I in your art?

11:33.651 --> 11:34.819
- Yeah.
- Oh.

11:35.862 --> 11:37.530
But that doesn't seem
very provocative.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.824
Oh, fuck off.
You haven't seen it yet.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.161
I'm not... Okay. Let's do it.

11:43.244 --> 11:44.704
I have a flier
because we printed them.

11:44.787 --> 11:46.456
- Oh. Great.
- Daniel Sinks, different forms.

11:46.539 --> 11:47.540
It's called "Green Light."

11:47.624 --> 11:49.125
Are you gonna look at us
and tell us you're coming?

11:49.208 --> 11:50.251
You gonna tell us?

11:50.335 --> 11:51.753
-You gonna promise?
-I'm coming to the show.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.129
-Okay.
-I'm coming to the show.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.255
-Okay.
-All right.

11:54.339 --> 11:55.632
- Man of your word.
- All right.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.841
-All right, thanks again.
-Yeah, see you later.

11:56.925 --> 11:57.967
- It's a pleasure.
- Okay.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.053
Wait. What about...
Wait, are you gonna wait for her?

12:00.136 --> 12:01.137
-Out there?
-Oh.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.347
No, she'll come meet us at home soon.

12:02.430 --> 12:03.556
- Yeah, she's good.
- Really?

12:03.640 --> 12:06.184
Yeah, she's good.
She's having a nice time.

12:06.267 --> 12:07.727
-Okay.
-We're tired. We got up early.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.228
- Yeah.
- All right.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.481
- Bye. Goodnight.
- Goodnight. Just slam the door.

12:11.564 --> 12:14.400
All right. We will.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.084
- Hey.
- Hi.

12:32.043 --> 12:34.379
Uh, your friends took off.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.005
I know.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.260
What?

12:44.263 --> 12:45.723
No?

12:55.191 --> 12:56.359
Okay.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.070
Yeah?

14:11.142 --> 14:12.310
Hello?

14:16.898 --> 14:18.191
Alison?

14:30.453 --> 14:31.454
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Fuck...

14:34.415 --> 14:37.668
Dude, open the door, I'm freezin'!

14:37.752 --> 14:40.671
My God.

14:45.176 --> 14:46.719
Hello.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.304
- Jonesy.
- Oh, my God.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.014
This guy just walked
right into me. Right in--

14:50.098 --> 14:51.307
Jonesy.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.017
Uh, first... and then...

14:53.101 --> 14:54.477
Help me.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.813
-I don't think I--
-I did. I brought coffee.

14:56.938 --> 14:59.690
Oh. Back up. I already made some.

14:59.774 --> 15:02.360
Oh, my God, I don't think I can move.

15:02.443 --> 15:04.153
I don't think we're going to brunch.

15:04.237 --> 15:06.364
-That's good. Yeah. Look in the fridge.
-Mmm-hmm.

15:06.447 --> 15:07.824
There's probably plenty in there.

15:07.907 --> 15:08.908
<i>I've got a little thing.</i>

15:09.659 --> 15:11.077
What?

15:11.160 --> 15:14.414
I, um... I'm not gonna say

15:14.497 --> 15:16.666
-that, like, I'm in love or anything.
-Hmm.

15:16.749 --> 15:19.460
I just... I'm not gonna...

15:19.544 --> 15:21.629
I don't have to tell you about it.

15:21.712 --> 15:25.091
No, you don't.
Can we talk about something else?

15:25.174 --> 15:28.010
The one liked me because she likes
my autobiographical work.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.887
She likes that I do work about myself.

15:29.971 --> 15:32.306
-She likes that you're famous. Go on.
-But she's also--

15:32.390 --> 15:34.267
No, she loves that you're famous.
Go on.

15:34.350 --> 15:36.978
She sees herself
as an autobiographical artist.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.313
And so she's connecting with me.
I understand the famous...

15:39.397 --> 15:40.982
-I'm not that famous.
-Oh, you're both... you're both...

15:41.065 --> 15:43.234
-Okay. Oh, okay. Yeah.
-Yeah. Memoirists or whatever, we--

15:43.317 --> 15:45.486
But how old is she?

15:45.570 --> 15:47.488
- And I'm not judging, I know--
- Twenty-four.

15:47.572 --> 15:50.616
Yeah, good for you.
And really beautiful, right?

15:50.700 --> 15:52.160
-Your hair looks good.
-No, but it's, like, really--

15:52.243 --> 15:53.411
- Really--
- Your hair looks good.

15:53.494 --> 15:55.538
-You're just letting it be, right?
-I don't... Can we...

15:55.621 --> 15:59.208
Honestly, you're doing
a monologue at all times.

15:59.292 --> 16:02.712
And then every once in a while...

16:02.795 --> 16:06.466
do you just...
See, now you're listening.

16:06.549 --> 16:09.385
But, like, I could say
nice things to you, like,

16:09.469 --> 16:12.680
"Do you know how green your eyes are?
Is it the shirt?

16:12.763 --> 16:14.140
What's happenin'?"

16:14.223 --> 16:16.601
"Last night, I met
this sexy young selfie artist,

16:16.684 --> 16:20.438
and I'm psyched because maybe
I'm gonna fuck her brains out."

16:20.563 --> 16:22.732
You know?
Like, did you already do that?

16:22.815 --> 16:24.108
Yeah.

16:24.192 --> 16:26.652
-Was it good? Was it good?
-I did it.

16:26.736 --> 16:27.904
-I'm pretty sure it was good.
-Okay.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.740
- I was like... I worked. Hard.
- But it's--

16:30.823 --> 16:31.824
All right!

16:31.908 --> 16:36.245
I mean, I really do think we should,
uh, just consider...

16:36.329 --> 16:38.039
We could adopt a kid.

16:38.122 --> 16:41.042
But we don't have to be
romantically involved, maybe.

16:41.125 --> 16:43.211
-Well, how about--
-And I'm not saying I know that will work,

16:43.294 --> 16:46.172
I'm just saying we wonder about that.

16:46.255 --> 16:50.384
Okay, how about you adopt a kid and
you call me and you're like, "It's here."

16:50.468 --> 16:52.345
"Come over and see it."

17:14.200 --> 17:15.284
Here you go, Jacob.

17:15.368 --> 17:17.328
-Black, just the way you like it.
-Yeah. Thank you.

17:17.411 --> 17:19.539
I think I should probably just
live here at some point.

17:19.622 --> 17:21.415
- Right?
- You're more than welcome.

17:21.499 --> 17:23.292
Nah. Thank you.

17:29.173 --> 17:30.675
- Yay!
- Holy shit!

17:30.758 --> 17:32.093
-When did it get cold?
-Right. It's freezing.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.345
-Is this it? I lost the invitation.
-Yes. Come. Come on!

17:34.428 --> 17:36.847
I had to look at my text that I sent you.
All right. Let's go.

18:10.339 --> 18:11.841
Do you want a beer?
I'm gonna go get soda.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.384
-No, no. I don't
-Okay. I'll be back.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.055
- Hey, man.
- I'm a really big fan.

18:18.139 --> 18:20.016
I just started reading <i>Obscurity.</i>
I'm such a fan of your work.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.892
-Thanks. I appreciate that.
-Thanks for everything you do.

18:21.976 --> 18:23.853
- That's great. Thank you.
- Jacob. Jacob.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.564
Over here. You gotta see these.

18:26.647 --> 18:28.274
-Yeah?
-Yeah, they're amazing.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.942
Oh, that's her.

18:30.026 --> 18:31.777
Like, I love, like, this whole--

18:31.861 --> 18:34.030
Yeah.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.865
Men's underpants.
They're probably that guy's.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.992
-Looks great. Look at her.
-That's not a man.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.577
It's incredible, the thing...

18:39.660 --> 18:41.912
-But this one's my favorite.
-Okay. Oh, shit!

18:41.996 --> 18:43.039
What the fuck?

18:43.122 --> 18:44.707
It's my favorite one.

18:44.790 --> 18:45.916
That's my ass.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.918
-That's me.
-I know. That's the side of...

18:48.002 --> 18:50.087
-It's your flank. But--
-God damn it, what is she doing?

18:50.171 --> 18:52.089
-Why did she do that?
-Stop, don't. Honestly, it's beautiful.

18:52.173 --> 18:53.466
No, but it's not right.
I want it taken down.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.842
No, but just put your...
put your arms down.

18:54.925 --> 18:56.218
-What?
-Hi, Jacob, how are ya?

18:56.302 --> 18:57.470
-Oh, hey.
-Hi, Dave. You know Dave.

18:57.553 --> 18:58.596
Oh, no, we've met. Yeah, hi.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.056
-Right. How are ya? It's...
-Oh, Annabelle Jones.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.515
I want that taken down, I think.

19:01.599 --> 19:04.352
It's not up to me, this is part
of the department's. This is--

19:04.435 --> 19:06.354
Okay, I'm gonna go get a beer.
I'll see you guys.

19:06.437 --> 19:07.605
This is a student
of the department.

19:07.688 --> 19:08.773
I know. I know who she is.

19:08.856 --> 19:10.566
-You were a guest of the department.
-I mean-- Yeah, yeah.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.110
-This is bad for the department.
-I got other problems, man.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.279
I threw you a bone
and this is how you repay...

19:15.363 --> 19:16.697
I'm up for tenure, do you understand?

19:16.781 --> 19:18.407
Look, I didn't... You didn't fuck her,
I fucked her.

19:18.491 --> 19:21.160
She's not gonna fuck your tenure up.
It's my ass on the wall.

19:21.243 --> 19:22.662
What do you think...
She's a grownup.

19:22.745 --> 19:24.205
What is she, you think
she's gonna call her daddy?

19:24.288 --> 19:25.623
-What are you, her daddy?
-This has become

19:25.706 --> 19:27.249
my problem,
there's evidence that you did...

19:27.333 --> 19:28.334
Dude, dude, dude.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.585
-Don't call me "dude."
-What the fuck?

19:29.669 --> 19:31.629
- You're a fuckin' cartoon.
- Wait. Oh, really?

19:31.712 --> 19:34.465
What are you, Professor?
Fucking loser. What is she--

19:34.548 --> 19:35.966
-Jake! Jake.
-Hi.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.593
Hi, how are you?

19:37.677 --> 19:39.637
I'm fine, but what is...
what is that?

19:39.720 --> 19:42.223
I didn't know you were
taking that. You can't just--

19:42.306 --> 19:43.516
I just wanted
to say congratulations.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.600
-Hi. Oh.
-I'm Annabelle.

19:44.684 --> 19:45.685
- Alison. Nice to meet you.
- Okay.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.645
Annabelle Jones.
Beautiful work. Congratulations.

19:47.728 --> 19:48.938
Annie, can I talk to her
for a second?

19:49.063 --> 19:51.565
-Well, I... She's having a show.
-Can I talk to her for a second?

19:51.649 --> 19:52.983
-Can I talk to her for a second?
-And I wanted to...

19:53.067 --> 19:55.236
Sure. Knock yourself out.

19:56.404 --> 19:59.240
That's not right.
You can't just put my...

19:59.323 --> 20:01.158
It's like date rape.
It's like a roofie picture.

20:01.242 --> 20:02.243
It's like date rape?

20:02.326 --> 20:04.745
- It is kind of, isn't it?
- So, I guess you don't like the work?

20:04.829 --> 20:05.955
Calm down.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.873
I'm not gonna calm down.
Like, my ass is hanging out.

20:07.957 --> 20:09.208
You didn't ask me if that...

20:09.291 --> 20:11.669
That's my house, you were in there,
I was sleeping.

20:11.752 --> 20:13.087
I didn't know you were
taking that picture.

20:13.170 --> 20:15.214
-That's just rude. What does it mean?
-Let me ask you a question.

20:15.297 --> 20:16.298
Did you draw me?

20:16.382 --> 20:17.633
-Yeah, I drew you.
-Oh.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.759
-But I didn't put it up.
-Did you ask me?

20:18.843 --> 20:20.428
I didn't tweet it,
I didn't put it on what, I...

20:20.511 --> 20:22.722
-Did you ask me permission?
-No, but I didn't do anything with it.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.306
So, it might end up in a book, right?

20:24.390 --> 20:25.891
-Yeah, but it's gonna end up--
-Maybe 12 years later,

20:25.975 --> 20:27.309
-but eventually.
-That's not the point.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.436
What does that mean?
There's no story to that.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.855
That's just sort of like, "Look,
I fucked this guy and he's sleeping."

20:30.938 --> 20:31.981
There's completely story,
this is my life.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.192
Look at this... that old guy.
No, no, I mean, how many are there?

20:35.276 --> 20:36.360
You have a whole phone
full of this shit?

20:36.444 --> 20:37.445
Are you trying to slut shame me now?

20:37.528 --> 20:39.739
No, I'm not trying to slut shame you.
Why didn't you return my text?

20:39.822 --> 20:42.992
- My privacy is public.
- Yeah, but mine isn't.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.785
Uh, I don't think that's true.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.537
-What do you--
-I think privacy is dead,

20:46.620 --> 20:47.997
and you were one of
the first people to do that.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.499
No. Oh, well, that's very flattering,
but, you know,

20:50.583 --> 20:52.877
I think that's not
the same fuckin' thing.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.504
Is that my privacy, when I...
What are you doing, Andrew?

20:55.588 --> 20:56.756
- Keep the passion.
- Is this your art?

20:56.839 --> 20:58.466
- Keep the passion. I love it.
- Is this your art?

20:58.549 --> 21:00.092
Keep the passion?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

21:00.176 --> 21:01.469
Okay, why don't you just
calm down for a second?

21:01.552 --> 21:02.887
Why don't you go live a real life?

21:02.970 --> 21:03.971
-There it is.
-What is... what is that?

21:04.054 --> 21:06.140
I know what
you're gonna do with that.

21:06.223 --> 21:07.224
What is that, click bait?

21:07.308 --> 21:08.350
-Oh, my God.
-Is that... is that what you...

21:08.434 --> 21:09.435
-This is what you do?
-Don't touch the work.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.021
Is it about the clicks?
Is that what determines your art?

21:12.104 --> 21:14.148
-Why don't you get a fuckin' job?
-This is my job.

21:14.231 --> 21:17.193
Really? Is it? How's that going?
You makin' a livin'? Where's the...

21:17.276 --> 21:18.360
Listen.

21:19.320 --> 21:21.739
What is this shit?
What are you, fucking zombies?

21:22.907 --> 21:24.575
Is this funny to you?

21:24.658 --> 21:27.787
You know what's really ironic is that
none of you have a point of view,

21:27.870 --> 21:29.580
but it's all the same
fuckin' point of view.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.165
There's no depth to what you're doing.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.417
You're as deep as your arm's length
to your fucking camera.

21:33.501 --> 21:34.502
Jacob, why don't you calm down?

21:34.585 --> 21:35.586
This is ridiculous.
These are like the...

21:35.669 --> 21:36.670
I know what you're gonna do with it.

21:36.754 --> 21:37.963
So what, I'm gonna be on

21:38.047 --> 21:39.256
<i>-the Internet tomorrow?</i>
<i>-Okay, ta-da!</i>

21:39.340 --> 21:41.842
<i>This means nothing,</i>
<i>and it's gonna last forever.</i>

21:41.926 --> 21:43.135
<i>- Congratulations.</i>

21:45.262 --> 21:48.724
<i>No depth to it. Just wait a second.</i>
<i>Here's how deep you are.</i>

21:48.808 --> 21:51.727
<i>Here's to your camera,</i>
<i>to your fucking dumb head.</i>

21:51.811 --> 21:53.437
-God damn it.
<i>-When you're not taking selfies,</i>

21:53.521 --> 21:55.564
<i>you're feeding off someone</i>
<i>who's having a real life.</i>

21:56.732 --> 21:58.859
<i>-Anyway, great. Ta-da!</i>
<i>-Good night.</i>

22:00.653 --> 22:01.862
Whether there's three people,

22:01.946 --> 22:04.615
there could be 300, 30 people,
it doesn't matter.

22:04.698 --> 22:05.866
-Ah, I just can't.
-Just talk...

22:05.950 --> 22:07.034
Just say what you want to say.

22:07.117 --> 22:08.786
No, I'm not gonna...
I... There's like...

22:08.869 --> 22:11.539
If there's, like, three people,
I don't...

22:12.164 --> 22:14.500
Hey, Mr. Malco.
It's gonna be about five minutes.

22:14.583 --> 22:15.584
-Can I get you--
-Five... Hey.

22:15.668 --> 22:17.503
If there's, like,
three people out there,

22:17.586 --> 22:20.256
can I just sign books
and maybe talk to them individually,

22:20.339 --> 22:21.841
and just leave?

22:21.924 --> 22:23.384
Uh, no, it's... We're full.

22:23.467 --> 22:26.011
Um, we had to borrow some chairs
from next door, actually.

22:26.095 --> 22:29.306
That's hilarious. I'm serious, though,
if there's, like, five people...

22:30.641 --> 22:33.727
Uh, seriously, there's, like,
50 or 60 people out there.

22:34.895 --> 22:35.896
-Really?
-Thank you, Mike.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.231
-So, yeah, it's a good turnout.
-Mike, right?

22:37.314 --> 22:38.857
-Yeah, I'm Mike.
-Annabelle. Thanks, Mike.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.317
-Hey. Yeah, sure.
-Yeah, there are 50 people.

22:40.401 --> 22:43.320
-Thanks. Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm. You need anything? I'm...

22:43.404 --> 22:45.656
- No, thanks.
- Not right now.

22:45.739 --> 22:46.740
-Okay.
-Thanks.

22:46.824 --> 22:48.409
-Mmm-hmm.
-Fifty.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.286
- I just...
- Good evening, everybody.

22:50.369 --> 22:53.581
I'd like to thank everyone for coming out
to our winter reading series.

22:53.664 --> 22:56.584
Uh, it's nice to see
such a great turnout.

22:56.667 --> 22:59.378
We have a very special guest tonight,
uh, Jacob Malco.

22:59.461 --> 23:02.172
He's a local Chicago graphic novelist.

23:02.256 --> 23:05.009
Uh, he's gonna be reading
from his new book, <i>Obscurity.</i>

23:05.092 --> 23:06.969
So let's give him a warm welcome.

23:11.515 --> 23:12.808
Thanks, Mike.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.603
Hi. How's everyone doin'?

23:15.686 --> 23:17.146
Good.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.982
I'm, uh, Jacob Malco, and, uh...

23:20.899 --> 23:22.443
I don't... I don't want to just read.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.862
I have a... I have a feeling
that some of you are here...

23:24.945 --> 23:29.533
Most of you are probably not here
'cause you even know who I am, right?

23:29.617 --> 23:32.244
I'm just, uh, the angry guy
from the video, right?

23:32.328 --> 23:34.163
How many people saw the video?

23:35.789 --> 23:37.458
Wow. Great.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.753
Well, I write graphic novels,

23:40.836 --> 23:42.630
but we don't have to
talk about that right now,

23:42.713 --> 23:45.299
'cause I feel like
you're expecting something else.

23:45.382 --> 23:46.425
And, um...

23:47.343 --> 23:48.385
let's just address that.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.639
Do you have any questions?

23:53.599 --> 23:54.600
What's up?

23:55.142 --> 23:57.936
Do you really think my generation's
just a bunch of vapid idiots?

23:58.062 --> 23:59.021
No, I mean, that was said in anger.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.565
Look, I watched that thing,
I'm not proud of it, but I had...

24:01.649 --> 24:05.402
I think I was trying to
make a point about, uh...

24:05.486 --> 24:08.030
I was personally upset
about some art work,

24:08.113 --> 24:11.367
and then I turned around
and there's 20, 30 people with iPhones

24:11.450 --> 24:13.869
taking essentially the same...

24:13.952 --> 24:15.329
piece of footage.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.247
If you were to look at that
in that moment,

24:17.331 --> 24:18.832
just turn around and spontaneously

24:18.916 --> 24:22.336
20 people with iPhones taping you,
that's pretty vapid.

24:22.419 --> 24:24.797
So, maybe it was just a reaction to that.

24:24.880 --> 24:26.215
Yes?

24:26.298 --> 24:30.386
Uh, I'm curious if the artist
who you slut shamed in the video

24:30.469 --> 24:32.930
has had any response to the tirade?

24:34.181 --> 24:36.350
No.

24:36.433 --> 24:37.976
But she's here.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.729
Alison is here.
You want to come up and,

24:40.813 --> 24:44.858
you know, and address the...
You want to make a comment?

24:44.942 --> 24:46.193
Are you inviting me?

24:46.276 --> 24:47.986
Yes, I'm inviting you.

24:48.070 --> 24:50.322
-Okay.
-Please come up and let's try to...

24:50.406 --> 24:52.574
Hey.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.453
Hi, guys.

24:56.537 --> 24:57.830
Um...

24:57.913 --> 25:02.793
So to give some context for the video,
um, we were at my grad show,

25:02.876 --> 25:08.090
um, I make work
that's not dissimilar to Jacob's.

25:08.173 --> 25:12.219
Um... I use myself
and my personal life

25:12.302 --> 25:16.223
and as a narrative and, um...
to bring up important ideas.

25:16.306 --> 25:21.687
Um, he uses a pen and paper
and I use a selfie stick and an iPhone.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.731
Right,
but I mean, he... Here's the...

25:23.814 --> 25:26.316
here's the other context, is that...

25:26.400 --> 25:29.027
we had, um,

25:29.111 --> 25:31.488
we had slept with each other
and I was asleep.

25:31.947 --> 25:33.198
- I was asleep and--
- See, like,

25:33.282 --> 25:34.700
that's really personal,
and you didn't ask me

25:34.783 --> 25:36.368
if you could share that
with everyone, so...

25:36.452 --> 25:37.745
Yeah, but I'm...
This is not the art,

25:37.828 --> 25:39.580
I mean, I'm trying to get
the proper...

25:39.663 --> 25:40.664
What was the problem--

25:40.748 --> 25:42.166
Well, you know,
it was jarring, you know.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.042
-I'm going to see this... Like, we--
-Right, but even now,

25:44.126 --> 25:45.836
you know, we're standing
in front of all these people

25:45.919 --> 25:48.005
-and you're not jarred...
-Like, I feel a little disrespected.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.590
A little blindsided.

25:56.263 --> 25:57.473
All right.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.602
That was fun.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.771
You know, it was.

26:03.854 --> 26:07.441
It was... it was really fun.
I thought it was engaging.

26:07.524 --> 26:09.818
I think it was...
We're a good team.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.069
Cheers to that.

26:11.153 --> 26:12.488
Yeah.

26:12.571 --> 26:16.408
Yeah, no, it was, uh... That was...
that was amazing. That was great.

26:16.492 --> 26:18.952
That was a book signing
that turned into, like,

26:19.036 --> 26:21.663
one of the best discussions I've had...

26:21.747 --> 26:22.748
-in the last two years.
-It--

26:22.831 --> 26:23.999
And I'm in grad school, so...

26:24.082 --> 26:25.209
You know what I mean?

26:25.292 --> 26:26.460
-That's not nothin'.
-I, uh...

26:26.543 --> 26:28.045
-Well, or maybe it says something...
-Oh, my God.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.922
-...about grad school, but...
-Let me just say this, though,

26:30.005 --> 26:31.006
uh, 'cause I don't want to forget.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.966
The... I, um...

26:34.301 --> 26:35.928
I am sorry...

26:36.011 --> 26:37.596
-Oh.
-...about...

26:37.679 --> 26:38.722
I didn't expect that.

26:38.806 --> 26:42.434
...about, you know,
making a scene at your big night.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.728
-And... I like the work.
-Honestly, I have to tell you--

26:44.812 --> 26:46.522
-Listen to me. I like the work.
-Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

26:46.605 --> 26:48.023
I like the work.

26:48.106 --> 26:49.107
You know, I was just...

26:49.191 --> 26:51.902
I think it was more of a personal issue.

26:51.985 --> 26:53.111
As it turns out.

26:53.195 --> 26:56.031
I'm... you know,
I'm stubborn, but I'm an open-minded guy.

26:56.114 --> 26:58.909
And... and I think that really
what it was about was...

27:00.077 --> 27:01.245
Well, let me say something first

27:01.328 --> 27:02.496
-to that point.
-All right, all right.

27:02.579 --> 27:05.040
Honestly, like, that is what I would...

27:05.123 --> 27:08.168
I couldn't have imagined...
Like, I could have paid someone

27:08.252 --> 27:12.422
to come in and do and say
what you said as a performance art piece.

27:12.506 --> 27:14.633
- I mean, this has, like, been--
- Well, it is now.

27:14.716 --> 27:18.428
Like, who has a grad show
and then gets a viral video out of it

27:18.512 --> 27:20.681
and then a great book signing
and, like, all this conversation.

27:20.764 --> 27:21.765
-I don't know.
-All right. All right.

27:21.849 --> 27:22.850
So I'm just saying, like...

27:22.933 --> 27:25.102
Art and life, right?
No... no difference, right?

27:25.185 --> 27:26.687
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.772
Hey. Hey!

27:28.856 --> 27:30.524
-What?
-Cheers.

27:31.608 --> 27:34.528
Oh, this is the greatest horrible thing
to ever happened to me.

27:36.154 --> 27:37.281
<i>So, uh, before we go,</i>

27:37.364 --> 27:38.907
I know you've gotta go,

27:38.991 --> 27:42.119
um, but I want to just ask you
one more question that might be weird.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.788
So, happy to turn this off or not,
you know.

27:44.872 --> 27:47.749
And I... I don't wanna, again,
embarrass you here, but the...

27:47.833 --> 27:51.003
I have to ask you about this,
the... the video.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.504
-You can turn that on.
-Are you sure?

27:52.588 --> 27:53.755
-Mmm-hmm.
-Okay. 'Cause it...

27:53.839 --> 27:56.633
All right, but I'm not trying to get you
or anything like that, I'm not gonna--

27:56.717 --> 27:57.968
-On the record.
-So you, yeah...

27:58.051 --> 28:00.429
Yeah, the video was,
you know, embarrassing.

28:00.512 --> 28:02.055
-Uh-huh.
-And when I first watched it,

28:02.139 --> 28:03.140
I was like, ugh.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.517
But it was...
it was weird 'cause when...

28:05.601 --> 28:07.728
-when I was losing it in that rage...
-Mmm-hmm.

28:07.811 --> 28:09.313
And I don't know if you're a rage guy
but, you know,

28:09.438 --> 28:10.856
-you don't have much control over it...
-Yeah.

28:10.939 --> 28:11.982
...when you're in it.

28:12.065 --> 28:14.109
But even when I was in it
and I saw all those cameras,

28:14.192 --> 28:16.194
I'm like, I know
what's gonna happen with this.

28:16.278 --> 28:18.322
-I dramatically lost my shit...
-Mmm-hmm.

28:18.405 --> 28:19.907
...in a public space
with a lot of cameras,

28:19.990 --> 28:21.450
and I knew something would happen,

28:21.533 --> 28:23.827
but I certainly didn't know
that it would get the...

28:23.911 --> 28:25.954
the traction that it got.

28:26.038 --> 28:27.664
I mean, I don't know if it's...

28:27.748 --> 28:29.416
Certainly, I'm not one for...

28:29.499 --> 28:30.876
-for adages...
-Mmm-hmm.

28:30.959 --> 28:33.754
...that, "No publicity
is bad publicity," is that it?

28:33.837 --> 28:36.131
But, look, I look like an asshole,

28:36.214 --> 28:39.009
but I did say a few things
I thought that I could get behind.

28:39.092 --> 28:42.512
It's a little bit embarrassing, but, uh...

28:42.596 --> 28:46.266
but, you know,
I think we're selling a few books.
