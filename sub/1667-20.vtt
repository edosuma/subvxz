00:00.419 --> 00:01.830
Previously on "The Originals"...

00:01.831 --> 00:05.059
We take Hope and the pack,
and we leave town tonight.

00:05.060 --> 00:07.215
This body is still linked
to Davina and those children.

00:07.216 --> 00:08.604
If I leave it and it dies,

00:08.605 --> 00:10.098
then Davina
and the others die with it.

00:10.099 --> 00:12.586
That child is rightfully mine.

00:12.587 --> 00:13.567
You're not taking her.

00:13.568 --> 00:17.189
Nightfall tomorrow
will come all too soon.

00:17.190 --> 00:18.772
In my plan to divide
and conquer,

00:18.773 --> 00:21.067
you are the perfect kindling.

00:21.068 --> 00:23.558
Ugh!

00:23.559 --> 00:25.270
Klaus!

00:25.271 --> 00:27.514
- What happened?
- Klaus made Aiden spy on us.

00:27.515 --> 00:30.317
Instead, he told me everything.
So you killed him.

00:30.318 --> 00:32.218
So what if I did?

00:34.254 --> 00:36.523
Rrgh!
Uh!

00:36.524 --> 00:38.224
Aagh...

00:49.036 --> 00:53.539
Dahlia, voice-over: We define
ourselves by our family.

00:54.808 --> 00:58.980
For birth, we share their names,

00:58.981 --> 01:04.062
entrust them to protect
that which we hold most dear.

01:10.390 --> 01:13.726
We value them
above all others...

01:16.062 --> 01:21.326
And yet inevitably,
we are forced apart.

01:22.236 --> 01:25.672
Promises are made

01:25.673 --> 01:29.175
then left unkept.

01:29.176 --> 01:31.144
Children in particular
turn their backs

01:31.145 --> 01:36.381
on those who raised them
seeking lives of their own.

01:38.017 --> 01:42.554
The bond of family is not a bond
forged by choice.

01:44.724 --> 01:49.723
In fact, some would see family
as a terrible burden.

02:01.941 --> 02:05.011
And thus, Niklaus,

02:05.012 --> 02:09.614
you find yourself here with me.

02:09.616 --> 02:11.716
Dahlia.

02:14.954 --> 02:16.955
Ah...

02:18.190 --> 02:20.292
What have you done to me?

02:23.062 --> 02:25.163
Where is my daughter?

02:26.465 --> 02:28.901
Get out of my head.

02:28.902 --> 02:30.970
I'm not in your head.

02:30.971 --> 02:34.039
You're in mine,
and seeing as you

02:34.040 --> 02:35.975
lie daggered by
your own beloved brother,

02:35.976 --> 02:38.510
you have no choice
but to listen.

02:40.112 --> 02:44.582
I have a proposition
for you. Come along.

02:52.616 --> 02:54.326
Spare me the agonizing boredom

02:54.327 --> 02:56.161
and explain what it is you want.

02:56.162 --> 02:58.162
Quiet.

02:59.631 --> 03:02.034
I've no use for
demented dreamscapes.

03:02.035 --> 03:04.635
Niklaus, listen.

03:19.052 --> 03:20.419
Oh, no.

03:20.420 --> 03:22.720
The vikings came while
you were in the garden.

03:25.357 --> 03:27.959
I'm scared, Dahlia.
Don't be.

03:27.960 --> 03:30.529
I'll protect us, Esther,
but come what may,

03:30.530 --> 03:34.099
we must remain
together always and forever.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.802
Promise?
Promise.

03:42.308 --> 03:45.377
No. Don't grab me!
Aah aah aah! Aah!

03:45.378 --> 03:47.045
Let her be!

03:47.046 --> 03:48.380
Oh! Uh!

03:48.381 --> 03:50.282
No. No. No!
Aah!

03:50.283 --> 03:51.983
No. Stop! Ah!
Stop! Let me out!

03:51.984 --> 03:54.586
Esther, no! No! Aah!

03:54.587 --> 03:56.950
Let me go!

03:56.951 --> 03:58.223
Let me guess.

03:58.224 --> 04:01.626
The vikings slaughtered
the entire village.

04:01.627 --> 04:05.864
Esther and I were
the only ones who survived.

04:05.865 --> 04:07.799
We promised to stay together.

04:07.800 --> 04:09.134
Yes, always and forever,

04:09.135 --> 04:11.381
a familiar promise,
but then, you knew that.

04:11.382 --> 04:13.550
I suppose you think
that makes us kindreds.

04:13.551 --> 04:16.074
Not exactly.

04:16.075 --> 04:19.543
What I mean to show you
is that we can be allies.

04:26.084 --> 04:27.856
Hayley is gone.

04:27.857 --> 04:29.387
You need to get her and the baby

04:29.388 --> 04:30.888
back here immediately.

04:30.889 --> 04:32.223
When Dahlia has been defeated.

04:32.224 --> 04:33.224
For now, they are safe.

04:33.225 --> 04:34.592
Nowhere is safe from Dahlia,

04:34.593 --> 04:36.027
and we will have no
chance of ending her

04:36.028 --> 04:38.196
without that baby.

04:38.197 --> 04:40.064
What are you saying?

04:40.065 --> 04:43.034
Dahlia is protected
by a powerful magic.

04:43.035 --> 04:44.701
We have collected
items that represent

04:44.703 --> 04:46.938
her vulnerabilities...
Sacred soil,

04:46.939 --> 04:49.507
the ash of a fallen viking,

04:49.508 --> 04:51.542
the blood of the witch
who broke her heart.

04:51.543 --> 04:53.465
Yours.
Yes.

04:53.466 --> 04:55.279
Now, I will use
these ingredients

04:55.280 --> 04:57.081
to create a killing ground

04:57.082 --> 04:58.749
where Dahlia will
be rendered mortal,

04:58.750 --> 05:01.385
but we need to lure
her there, Elijah.

05:01.386 --> 05:04.255
Are you suggesting
that I position

05:04.256 --> 05:07.191
my niece as bait?

05:07.192 --> 05:09.560
Oh, how wonderfully convenient

05:09.561 --> 05:11.262
to offer this strategy

05:11.263 --> 05:13.485
when Niklaus has been removed.

05:13.486 --> 05:15.566
Klaus cannot be reasoned with.

05:15.567 --> 05:16.700
You can't honestly believe

05:16.701 --> 05:17.768
that I would allow
you to do this.

05:17.769 --> 05:18.769
What I believe is, you will make

05:18.770 --> 05:20.204
the right choice for Hope.

05:20.205 --> 05:21.572
There is no other way
to keep her

05:21.573 --> 05:24.141
from the miserable
existence I endured,

05:24.142 --> 05:26.581
one of slavery under a tyrant.

05:26.582 --> 05:29.079
Of course, if Dahlia does die,

05:29.080 --> 05:30.614
you will also be
free of that tyranny...

05:30.615 --> 05:33.884
No more running, no more hiding.

05:33.885 --> 05:36.320
So do not insult my intelligence

05:36.321 --> 05:38.676
by painting your actions
as selfless.

05:38.677 --> 05:41.225
If you will not bring
Hayley back here,

05:41.226 --> 05:43.227
I will find Hope myself,

05:43.228 --> 05:46.762
and, as I said,
there is no other way.

05:49.266 --> 05:51.902
I won't stand
for this chauvinism.

05:51.903 --> 05:53.503
It used to be called chivalry,

05:53.504 --> 05:55.505
and back then, you
liked it just fine.

05:55.506 --> 05:57.941
I'm not sitting out the fight
in some musty club.

05:57.942 --> 05:59.843
This musty club is
the only place in the city

05:59.844 --> 06:01.478
where magic can't hurt you,

06:01.479 --> 06:04.661
and it has the best bourbon.

06:04.662 --> 06:05.949
Elijah needs me.

06:05.950 --> 06:08.498
Elijah can't worry about
keeping you and Hope safe.

06:08.499 --> 06:11.126
We discussed it.

06:11.127 --> 06:13.557
You'll have to kill me
to keep me here.

06:13.558 --> 06:15.358
Hey, look.

06:15.359 --> 06:17.194
Thanks to Eva Sinclair,
you are linked

06:17.195 --> 06:19.329
to 8 teenage witches, remember?

06:19.330 --> 06:22.332
If you get hurt, so do they,
including Davina.

06:22.333 --> 06:25.468
I know you don't want that.

06:27.271 --> 06:29.806
I can't live like
a porcelain doll,

06:29.807 --> 06:33.643
and I have no clue how
to undo the damn spell.

06:33.644 --> 06:35.644
That's why he's here.

06:36.746 --> 06:39.149
Oh...

06:39.150 --> 06:41.518
Could've just sent me a text.

06:41.519 --> 06:43.186
Well, Marcel's in
a very kidnappy mood

06:43.187 --> 06:46.356
this morning,
but since you're here,

06:46.357 --> 06:47.857
unlink me.

06:47.858 --> 06:49.625
I've got a thousand
places I'd rather be.

06:49.627 --> 06:53.730
Whoa, this kind of dark magic,

06:53.731 --> 06:56.533
mm, it's tricky.

06:56.534 --> 06:58.882
All right. I can
reverse-engineer Eva's work,

06:58.883 --> 07:00.870
but it's gonna take some time,

07:00.871 --> 07:02.504
and you're gonna have
to do your own magic.

07:02.506 --> 07:03.907
She's not exactly a pro.

07:03.908 --> 07:05.722
Well, she is exactly
in the host body

07:05.723 --> 07:07.343
that's at the center
of the link.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.512
Besides, I've done
my last bit of magic.

07:09.513 --> 07:12.281
Now, I want to help the kids,
but after that, I'm done,

07:12.282 --> 07:13.549
no more witch business.

07:13.550 --> 07:14.984
Fine.
Mm-hmm.

07:14.985 --> 07:17.153
Get it done.
I'll touch base later.

07:17.154 --> 07:20.556
And when we're done,
we're all done.

07:20.557 --> 07:23.024
I'm not your witch for hire.

07:36.439 --> 07:38.588
I left you a dozen messages.

07:38.589 --> 07:39.842
Family crisis.

07:39.843 --> 07:41.443
Have you spoken to Klaus?

07:41.445 --> 07:42.678
Well, briefly.

07:42.679 --> 07:43.946
Before I put him to sleep
with a dagger,

07:43.947 --> 07:45.514
words were exchanged.

07:45.515 --> 07:49.451
No. Elijah, Klaus
didn't kill Aiden.

07:50.553 --> 07:51.921
He just took the blame

07:51.922 --> 07:53.455
because of some
insane dictator edict

07:53.456 --> 07:55.390
about making people fear him.

07:58.694 --> 08:01.263
Nevertheless,
had I left Niklaus standing,

08:01.264 --> 08:03.766
the very army protecting
Hope would have revolted.

08:03.767 --> 08:04.967
But you can't just
leave him like that

08:04.968 --> 08:06.435
while his daughter's in danger.

08:06.436 --> 08:08.576
Please. Your feelings
are clouding your judgment.

08:08.577 --> 08:09.805
My feelings?

08:09.806 --> 08:12.941
For my brother.
I'm not a fool, Camille.

08:12.942 --> 08:15.411
Although I valued
our time together

08:15.412 --> 08:16.912
at the safe house,
make no mistake.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.147
I was in your head as much
as you were in mine.

08:21.116 --> 08:23.485
How long are you gonna
leave him like that...

08:23.486 --> 08:26.488
5 years, 10, a lifetime?

08:26.489 --> 08:28.489
Till Hope is safe.

08:31.326 --> 08:33.594
Now I need your help.

08:39.900 --> 08:42.236
Elijah called.

08:42.238 --> 08:43.905
Freya is doing a locator
spell to find us.

08:43.905 --> 08:46.990
We need to leave now.

08:46.991 --> 08:50.243
Wait. You're burying Aiden here.

08:50.244 --> 08:52.147
I can't keep carrying
him around forever.

08:52.148 --> 08:53.415
Just give me a minute
to get him into the ground,

08:53.416 --> 08:54.983
and we'll get out of here.

08:54.984 --> 08:56.418
You said that this
is how wolves bury

08:56.419 --> 08:58.153
murderers and traitors.

08:58.154 --> 08:59.854
I know that Aiden was
answering to Klaus,

08:59.855 --> 09:01.957
but he was loyal to
the pack in the end.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.692
That's what got him
killed, Jack.

09:03.693 --> 09:06.528
You don't think I know that?

09:06.529 --> 09:11.299
You think this is how I want
to put Aiden to rest?

09:13.336 --> 09:14.769
I don't have a choice, Hayley.

09:14.770 --> 09:17.238
You said it yourself.
We got to go.

09:17.239 --> 09:21.176
It's not right.

09:21.177 --> 09:23.645
If we expect the wolves
to put their lives

09:23.646 --> 09:25.180
on the line for hope,
then they deserve

09:25.181 --> 09:27.649
to know that those
lives matter to us.

09:33.888 --> 09:36.190
We'll take Aiden down river,

09:36.191 --> 09:39.661
give him a true
Crescent funeral.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.629
Too much has been
taken from our pack.

09:41.630 --> 09:45.767
I won't let them lose this, too.

09:49.871 --> 09:52.572
Uh!

09:53.908 --> 09:58.513
What good's a jazz club
with no bloody jazz?

09:58.514 --> 10:00.514
Do you mind?

10:00.515 --> 10:02.483
I'm trying to reverse
a very complicated sacrifice,

10:02.484 --> 10:04.819
but then you whining about
jazz is not helping me.

10:04.820 --> 10:07.088
I'm afraid we have
more pressing concerns.

10:07.089 --> 10:08.122
What's all this?

10:08.123 --> 10:09.490
Dark objects,

10:09.491 --> 10:11.225
because, apparently,
now I'm a dispensary.

10:11.226 --> 10:12.660
It seems that Niklaus'
distrust of Freya

10:12.661 --> 10:15.262
was not entirely misplaced.

10:15.263 --> 10:16.831
Our sister wants to use Hope

10:16.832 --> 10:19.600
to lure Dahlia into a trap.

10:19.601 --> 10:21.168
And I assume you told her

10:21.169 --> 10:22.636
she's out of her lunatic mind.

10:22.637 --> 10:25.171
I have another idea.

10:25.172 --> 10:27.508
Hope is something of a beacon
for this new terror,

10:27.509 --> 10:29.043
and now that she's been cloaked,

10:29.044 --> 10:31.111
perhaps we could use something
else to ensnare Dahlia.

10:31.112 --> 10:33.914
These enchanted objects
should generate enough power

10:33.915 --> 10:36.057
to create a decoy of some kind.

10:36.058 --> 10:38.419
Mr. Griffith, where do you
think you're going?

10:38.420 --> 10:40.054
I agreed to help Rebekah
break her bond

10:40.055 --> 10:41.121
with them 8 kids.

10:41.122 --> 10:42.756
When you want to get
back to that,

10:42.757 --> 10:44.792
um, text me.

10:44.793 --> 10:47.127
Right now, I need the best minds

10:47.128 --> 10:49.930
and the most formidable
witches in this city.

10:49.931 --> 10:51.365
Mr. Griffith, do you
have any idea

10:51.366 --> 10:53.100
the danger my niece now faces?

10:53.101 --> 10:54.735
I wish her well...
I really do...

10:54.736 --> 10:57.671
But I'm done with magic,
and this ain't my fight.

10:59.741 --> 11:02.876
Elijah, it's not worth it.

11:02.877 --> 11:05.244
I'll call Davina.
I'm sure she'd be happy to help.

11:06.947 --> 11:08.447
Uh!

11:12.786 --> 11:14.954
Dahlia demanded Hope
by nightfall.

11:14.956 --> 11:17.490
Time is of the essence.

11:50.882 --> 11:53.118
You sure you want to do this?

11:53.119 --> 11:55.586
What else am I gonna do?

12:06.198 --> 12:08.900
I mean, it's not like
I can call my family

12:08.901 --> 12:10.902
because, um, they suck.

12:10.903 --> 12:12.404
I can't get revenge
because Klaus

12:12.405 --> 12:13.805
is already in a coffin,

12:13.806 --> 12:15.540
and even if he wasn't,
that's suicide.

12:15.541 --> 12:18.910
So you tell me, Marcel,
what else is there?

12:18.911 --> 12:21.446
I have to leave.
Oh, wait. Let me guess.

12:21.447 --> 12:22.881
You, uh...

12:22.882 --> 12:24.449
You need me to patrol
the city for some witch.

12:24.450 --> 12:26.167
No. No, Josh.

12:26.168 --> 12:29.087
I'm not here to tell
you what to do.

12:29.088 --> 12:32.089
I'm just here.

12:39.030 --> 12:41.698
We were gonna leave town.

12:44.369 --> 12:46.604
I spent his last day
saying good-bye

12:46.605 --> 12:48.806
to everybody but him.

12:54.546 --> 12:57.547
Marcel, I...

12:59.584 --> 13:02.252
I didn't even get
to say good-bye.

13:13.631 --> 13:16.567
Charming.

13:16.568 --> 13:19.237
This dismal hovel
is where I endured

13:19.238 --> 13:23.774
the terrors of viking
captivity for years.

13:26.345 --> 13:28.646
Aah! Aah!

13:28.647 --> 13:31.015
Uh! No.

13:31.016 --> 13:32.650
Uh!

13:38.520 --> 13:41.617
I performed the dark
magic they demanded

13:41.618 --> 13:44.370
so that Esther would be free
of their violent abuse.

13:44.371 --> 13:46.931
While she was out in the sun
gathering herbs,

13:46.932 --> 13:49.800
I toiled in the gray
of this room,

13:49.801 --> 13:51.702
but I never resented her.

13:51.703 --> 13:54.170
We'd made a promise.

13:55.406 --> 13:58.676
Is this your feeble attempt
to garner sympathy?

13:58.677 --> 14:00.010
To what end?

14:00.011 --> 14:01.946
No ancient plight
will ever justify

14:01.947 --> 14:04.390
your intention to
enslave my daughter.

14:04.391 --> 14:08.785
Oh, Niklaus,
our plights are the same.

14:17.061 --> 14:19.030
You've been with Mikael.

14:19.031 --> 14:21.697
Heh, we were only talking.

14:24.566 --> 14:27.371
No matter.

14:27.372 --> 14:30.039
I have something to show you.

14:31.698 --> 14:35.979
This is potent sage
soaked in serpent's blood.

14:35.980 --> 14:39.049
It'll give us strength.
We can get out of this place.

14:39.050 --> 14:42.519
Esther, together,
we can live forever.

14:42.520 --> 14:44.654
Dahlia, stop.

14:45.754 --> 14:50.293
I no longer wish
to practice magic.

14:50.294 --> 14:52.996
Magic has kept us alive.

14:52.997 --> 14:55.698
And Mikael will
protect me now, sister.

14:58.702 --> 15:03.206
We plan to marry, have a family.

15:03.207 --> 15:06.408
I am your family.

15:06.410 --> 15:10.915
I'm your sister.
We promised each other.

15:10.916 --> 15:12.849
You'll always be
my sister, Dahlia,

15:12.850 --> 15:16.686
but I wish for
children of my own,

15:16.687 --> 15:20.589
and... I love him.

15:21.998 --> 15:24.928
Stay, Esther.
Let's sing our song.

15:24.929 --> 15:26.095
But I don't remember that silly,

15:26.096 --> 15:28.698
little tune anymore, Dahlia.

16:01.246 --> 16:04.433
You really went all out
cataloging all this stuff.

16:04.434 --> 16:07.436
Have you diagnosed yourself
with OCD yet?

16:07.437 --> 16:09.905
Very funny. It's
my family's legacy.

16:09.906 --> 16:10.907
I guess I'm done pretending

16:10.908 --> 16:12.441
I can stay out of it.

16:12.442 --> 16:13.709
Unless there's
something in that ledger

16:13.710 --> 16:15.344
about mimicking
a magical, tribrid baby,

16:15.345 --> 16:18.614
we're up the creek.

16:18.615 --> 16:21.350
Oh, right.

16:21.351 --> 16:24.864
Don't touch that.

16:24.865 --> 16:26.447
Ugh.

16:27.689 --> 16:29.493
What, exactly, are you up to?

16:29.494 --> 16:32.288
It's a resurrection
spell for Kol.

16:32.289 --> 16:34.897
Remember him,
the brother you swore to save?

16:34.898 --> 16:38.434
I have every intention of...

16:38.435 --> 16:40.669
Wait.

16:40.670 --> 16:42.571
When Kol was trying
to find a way out of dying,

16:42.572 --> 16:44.406
he used representational magic.

16:44.407 --> 16:46.241
He... he tried to
transfer the curse

16:46.242 --> 16:48.977
into a clay doll, a golem.

16:48.978 --> 16:51.512
Here.

16:53.131 --> 16:55.617
She's right.

16:55.618 --> 16:57.252
If we can find a way
to replicate

16:57.253 --> 16:59.788
the baby's power source
and transfer it into the doll,

16:59.789 --> 17:03.558
that's our decoy.

17:08.463 --> 17:10.165
You used to run these woods

17:10.165 --> 17:11.633
when you were cursed
to a wolf form?

17:11.634 --> 17:14.903
Ran them before.
I was an angry kid.

17:14.904 --> 17:16.672
I was pissed we were exiled.

17:16.673 --> 17:19.508
I was pissed at my parents,
pissed you were gone.

17:19.509 --> 17:21.843
Every kid with
the wolf gene is angry.

17:21.844 --> 17:23.912
I was a nightmare.

17:23.913 --> 17:25.714
Triggering the curse

17:25.714 --> 17:27.214
actually settled me down.

17:27.215 --> 17:28.817
Oh, not me.
I got worse.

17:28.818 --> 17:30.819
Of course, it was different.

17:30.820 --> 17:33.522
When I triggered my curse,
the Crescent curse kicked in.

17:33.523 --> 17:35.724
So I was stuck
as a wolf all month long.

17:35.725 --> 17:38.260
One full moon,
our Alpha didn't show up.

17:38.261 --> 17:40.028
He was killed.

17:40.029 --> 17:43.231
So I stepped up,
protected these people,

17:43.232 --> 17:46.368
kept them safe,
and that calmed me down,

17:46.369 --> 17:47.769
at least for a little while.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.974
I need to stop and feed her.

17:52.975 --> 17:54.909
There's a hideout about
a half-mile south of here.

17:54.910 --> 17:56.644
Grab some guys
to watch your back.

17:56.645 --> 17:58.546
I'll round up the rest,
and we'll make a perimeter.

17:58.547 --> 18:01.157
This bayou's our territory.
We'll defend it.

18:11.292 --> 18:13.889
So Esther was cruel.

18:13.890 --> 18:16.230
You'll excuse my complete
lack of surprise.

18:16.231 --> 18:17.899
Seems it does run in the family.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.600
She left me for one
of the very men who

18:19.601 --> 18:22.231
slaughtered our village
and stole us away.

18:22.232 --> 18:26.707
My own sister abandoned me,

18:26.708 --> 18:30.044
just as your siblings have done,

18:30.045 --> 18:32.747
and, like you,

18:32.748 --> 18:35.583
I have been unjustly painted

18:35.584 --> 18:39.862
as the villain of the story.

18:42.590 --> 18:44.791
Oh...

18:45.743 --> 18:48.496
Ah!

18:48.497 --> 18:50.531
Oh!

18:50.532 --> 18:52.366
If you have a deal to propose,

18:52.367 --> 18:55.069
then find my body
and undagger me.

18:55.070 --> 19:00.307
Oh, I have the means
to undagger you.

19:00.308 --> 19:02.243
I'm just not finished here.

19:02.244 --> 19:03.878
I don't care about my mother.

19:03.879 --> 19:05.779
What I have to show you next
is not about your mother.

19:05.780 --> 19:08.716
It's about your daughter,
and if you have any chance

19:08.717 --> 19:11.085
to save her from
what is to come,

19:11.086 --> 19:14.687
I suggest you listen.

19:23.842 --> 19:25.911
Very cliche.

19:25.912 --> 19:27.245
Tell me, did you inspire

19:27.246 --> 19:29.281
the witches of Grimm lore,

19:29.282 --> 19:31.116
enslaving a young girl in a hut

19:31.117 --> 19:32.651
on the edge of a dark forest?

19:32.652 --> 19:33.752
I suppose you planned

19:33.753 --> 19:35.220
for this to be Hope's fate.

19:35.221 --> 19:36.654
I did not enslave Freya.

19:36.655 --> 19:39.057
I kept her from those
who abused our craft,

19:39.058 --> 19:42.160
demonized us,
and, most importantly,

19:42.161 --> 19:45.796
I shielded her from herself.

19:54.604 --> 19:58.009
Freya? Freya, Freya,

19:58.010 --> 20:01.012
where did you get
the yarrow flower?

20:01.013 --> 20:03.982
You cannot go past the stream.

20:03.983 --> 20:05.750
It is too dangerous.

20:05.751 --> 20:07.618
Then where shall I go,

20:07.619 --> 20:09.964
to the hovel
or maybe your garden?

20:09.965 --> 20:12.383
Oh, no. I'm not allowed
to venture that far.

20:12.384 --> 20:13.992
I might encounter
another person,

20:13.993 --> 20:15.827
and you would not
stand for that.

20:15.828 --> 20:17.694
People are frightened

20:17.696 --> 20:19.363
of that which they do
not understand.

20:19.364 --> 20:21.065
They will only hate you.

20:21.066 --> 20:23.134
I hate this place!

20:23.135 --> 20:26.002
I want to see more
than the same trees,

20:26.004 --> 20:29.740
the same hills,
a face that isn't yours.

20:29.741 --> 20:32.810
Freya, control it.

20:34.212 --> 20:36.379
Uh... uh...

20:36.381 --> 20:38.416
Control yourself, Freya.

20:38.417 --> 20:41.986
Uh, uh, uh...

20:41.987 --> 20:44.321
Freya, focus.

20:57.301 --> 21:00.671
Sing with me.
Calm your heart.

21:07.760 --> 21:10.607
You sure it was completely
out of control?

21:10.608 --> 21:12.983
Firstborn witches
in this bloodline

21:12.984 --> 21:15.552
possess devastating power.

21:15.553 --> 21:18.422
You're saying this is
what's to come for Hope.

21:18.423 --> 21:22.426
Hope will suffer
far more than Freya.

21:22.427 --> 21:25.095
Hope's magic will be tainted
with your vampire blood

21:25.096 --> 21:27.498
as well as the aggressive
wolf temperament.

21:27.499 --> 21:31.034
Without the proper tutelage
that only I can provide,

21:31.035 --> 21:33.737
Hope's power will
grow unchecked.

21:33.738 --> 21:38.442
She will lash out at
everyone, including you.

21:38.443 --> 21:40.711
She'll devastate
the city that you love,

21:40.712 --> 21:45.849
and then her terror
will spread far beyond.

21:45.850 --> 21:48.385
I, too, am a firstborn,
so I was the only one

21:48.386 --> 21:50.453
to help save Freya from herself,

21:50.455 --> 21:54.860
just as I'm the only one
who can save your daughter.

21:54.861 --> 21:58.435
You've seen it, Klaus.
You need me.

22:09.072 --> 22:10.740
Miss him already?

22:10.741 --> 22:12.248
Niklaus didn't kill Aiden.

22:13.777 --> 22:17.079
So... who the hell did it, then?

22:19.082 --> 22:22.452
Freya, Dahlia,
any number of witches

22:22.453 --> 22:24.932
with the desire to turn
me against my brother.

22:24.933 --> 22:27.090
Hmm.

22:27.091 --> 22:28.892
So, given
that taking out enemies

22:28.893 --> 22:31.794
is sort of Klaus' forte,

22:31.795 --> 22:34.763
you thinking about
pulling that dagger out?

22:36.032 --> 22:38.768
Until Hope is safe,

22:38.769 --> 22:43.105
I would rather not unleash
that Shakespearean rage.

22:44.574 --> 22:46.776
Well, whoever did frame
him for Aiden's death

22:46.777 --> 22:48.444
got us to take
our biggest weapon

22:48.445 --> 22:50.646
off the table, which means

22:50.647 --> 22:53.615
you're gonna have
to think like him.

22:59.922 --> 23:01.290
So the mikaelsons got you

23:01.291 --> 23:02.859
fetching their coffee now, huh?

23:02.860 --> 23:04.360
It's brain fuel.
They're struggling in there.

23:04.361 --> 23:05.828
Things are catching fire
that aren't supposed to.

23:05.829 --> 23:06.929
They're going through
dark objects like crazy.

23:06.930 --> 23:09.165
Caffeine is my Hail Mary.

23:09.166 --> 23:12.201
This is for Rebekah.

23:12.202 --> 23:14.337
It's a spell that unlinks her

23:14.338 --> 23:15.671
to them kids.

23:15.672 --> 23:16.772
It's got everything...

23:16.773 --> 23:18.107
Diagrams, pronunciations.

23:18.108 --> 23:19.275
It should be pretty
straightforward,

23:19.276 --> 23:21.444
even for a baby witch.

23:21.445 --> 23:23.546
You know, heh, wouldn't it

23:23.547 --> 23:25.481
be easier if you just did it?

23:25.482 --> 23:27.149
I mean, a kid's
life is at stake.

23:27.150 --> 23:28.451
I'm carrying lattes.

23:28.452 --> 23:30.164
You have a gift,
and you're not using it.

23:30.165 --> 23:32.021
Magic is not a gift, Cami.

23:32.022 --> 23:34.190
In my experience, it's
a loaded assault rifle

23:34.191 --> 23:36.492
with a hair trigger,
and I'm putting my gun down.

23:36.493 --> 23:38.327
I don't give a damn
what you, Elijah,

23:38.328 --> 23:40.196
or the covens got
to say about that.

23:40.197 --> 23:43.032
"The covens"?

23:43.033 --> 23:46.635
Josephine la rue.

23:46.636 --> 23:49.805
She was our regent,
chosen emissary

23:49.806 --> 23:52.574
for all our consecrated dead.

23:52.575 --> 23:57.312
The ancestors speak
through the regent.

23:57.313 --> 23:59.148
With Josephine gone,
the covens are a mess.

23:59.149 --> 24:01.316
They need guidance.
They got nothing.

24:01.317 --> 24:02.779
They think they want me,

24:02.780 --> 24:05.521
but, like I said, I am done.

24:05.522 --> 24:08.223
Look, Vincent.
I get it.

24:08.224 --> 24:11.827
I lost my uncle to a hex

24:11.828 --> 24:15.631
and my brother, um...

24:17.433 --> 24:19.334
But even I understand

24:19.335 --> 24:20.869
that it's more
complicated than that.

24:20.870 --> 24:23.472
My friend Davina
is trying to save

24:23.473 --> 24:25.607
someone she loved.

24:25.608 --> 24:27.542
She believes in something
bigger than herself,

24:27.543 --> 24:30.045
and that helps her.

24:30.046 --> 24:31.947
What I'm trying to say is,
magic in the right hands

24:31.948 --> 24:34.061
can be a good thing.

24:34.062 --> 24:38.253
Just not my hands, not anymore.

24:38.254 --> 24:40.555
Oh... wait.

24:40.556 --> 24:42.457
They have a golem.

24:42.458 --> 24:44.626
They keep using
different binding agents.

24:44.627 --> 24:47.394
We're desperate.
Do you have any ideas?

24:49.397 --> 24:51.866
Look. No powerful witch

24:51.867 --> 24:54.269
is gonna be fooled by a doll.

24:54.270 --> 24:56.271
They need a heartbeat.

24:56.272 --> 24:59.940
Eh, here. Hold this.

25:06.332 --> 25:09.149
So after all that, Klaus wasn't
even the one that killed Aiden.

25:09.151 --> 25:10.952
Thought you'd want to know.

25:10.953 --> 25:12.754
Why would he take the blame?

25:12.755 --> 25:14.422
Because he's stubborn
and irresponsible

25:14.423 --> 25:16.157
on top of being a bloodthirsty,

25:16.158 --> 25:18.293
murdering lunatic.

25:18.294 --> 25:19.678
You doing ok?

25:21.429 --> 25:23.931
It's...

25:23.932 --> 25:27.435
Pack morale isn't exactly
awesome right now.

25:27.436 --> 25:29.188
Jackson's heartbroken.

25:32.483 --> 25:34.409
Aiden was our friend.

25:34.410 --> 25:36.477
You're a leader
who cares for her people.

25:36.478 --> 25:37.945
I get it.

25:37.946 --> 25:40.281
Right now, you're
a leader at war.

25:40.282 --> 25:41.716
Now, you can either
be their friend

25:41.717 --> 25:42.783
or their queen.

25:42.784 --> 25:44.151
You can't be both.
All right.

25:44.152 --> 25:46.020
Those wolves, Jackson,
they'd die for you.

25:46.021 --> 25:50.391
Question is, are you
gonna let them?

25:50.392 --> 25:52.593
If the answer's yes,

25:52.594 --> 25:54.463
then you got to live with that.

26:09.687 --> 26:11.812
We're out of time.

26:11.813 --> 26:14.982
I've located Hayley,
and I strongly advise,

26:14.983 --> 26:17.194
do not attempt
to stand in my way.

26:20.487 --> 26:22.356
Niklaus' paintings contain

26:22.357 --> 26:24.925
Mikael's ashes in the soil.

26:24.926 --> 26:27.995
Go to the compound.

26:27.996 --> 26:29.830
You cannot stop me
from getting that baby.

26:29.831 --> 26:33.096
You begin this spell.
Prepare the battlefield.

26:33.097 --> 26:36.421
I'll bring Hope to you.

26:49.036 --> 26:53.230
Your daughter will
need my guidance...

26:54.741 --> 26:57.311
Just as Freya did.

26:57.312 --> 26:58.979
I think I'll find
someone less hostile

26:58.980 --> 26:59.980
to teach her.

26:59.981 --> 27:01.281
Shouldn't be difficult.

27:01.282 --> 27:03.116
Practically anyone would
fit that criteria.

27:03.117 --> 27:06.687
Will you be interviewing tutors
while you lie desiccated?

27:06.688 --> 27:10.190
How long, do you think,
before Elijah

27:10.191 --> 27:12.426
and Rebekah release you?

27:12.427 --> 27:14.394
How old will Hope be?

27:14.395 --> 27:16.296
So after twice failing
to create a family

27:16.297 --> 27:18.632
of your own, now you
wish to commandeer mine?

27:18.633 --> 27:21.134
Not gonna happen, sweetheart.

27:21.135 --> 27:25.178
Family? Family only
ever brought me pain.

27:28.241 --> 27:30.177
I want power.

27:30.178 --> 27:32.079
I am owed Hope's,
and without it,

27:32.080 --> 27:34.915
I will slumber again
within the year.

27:34.916 --> 27:37.083
Freya turned on me
because I denied her

27:37.084 --> 27:41.888
a basic need...
The love of a parent.

27:41.889 --> 27:45.592
That is why I need you, Niklaus,

27:45.593 --> 27:48.327
to remain her father.

27:54.267 --> 27:56.770
Try to imagine this.

27:56.771 --> 27:58.938
You will get
to raise your daughter,

27:58.939 --> 28:01.274
and I will channel the magic
that has been promised to me,

28:01.275 --> 28:03.176
and in so doing,
I would help Hope

28:03.177 --> 28:05.777
to hone her craft that you
couldn't possibly comprehend.

28:06.846 --> 28:09.115
With us by your side,
no one would ever

28:09.116 --> 28:12.151
test you ever again,

28:12.152 --> 28:14.954
or you could lie there

28:14.955 --> 28:18.458
and pray that Elijah
releases you

28:18.459 --> 28:20.560
before Hope learns

28:20.561 --> 28:24.112
to call Jackson "daddy."

28:43.482 --> 28:47.420
Children... please.

28:47.421 --> 28:50.138
Huh... uh!

28:55.461 --> 28:57.324
I'm here to see Hope.

28:57.325 --> 28:59.298
Not gonna happen.

28:59.299 --> 29:00.332
One bite from us,

29:00.333 --> 29:01.567
there's venom in your veins.

29:01.568 --> 29:02.668
Hard to find anything
in these woods

29:02.669 --> 29:03.869
when your head's not right.

29:03.870 --> 29:04.748
Hrgh!

29:04.749 --> 29:06.772
Aah! Uh!

29:06.773 --> 29:09.108
Must we proceed
with this nonsense?

29:09.109 --> 29:10.743
From what I understand,
you didn't exactly

29:10.744 --> 29:13.579
fare well against my brother.

29:13.580 --> 29:15.547
There's a difference
between you and Klaus.

29:15.548 --> 29:17.750
See, you can't kill me.

29:17.751 --> 29:19.985
You're waiting for the day
I die so that you

29:19.986 --> 29:23.088
can take your immortal
place beside Hayley,

29:23.089 --> 29:25.173
and if you kill me,
you lose her for good.

29:26.692 --> 29:28.893
She'll never forgive you.

29:30.162 --> 29:32.097
And speak of the devil.

29:34.099 --> 29:36.468
Elijah...

29:36.469 --> 29:38.003
You shouldn't be here.

29:38.004 --> 29:40.706
We have another plan.
Rebekah and Davina found a way.

29:40.707 --> 29:43.912
If we can replicate
Hope's magic,

29:43.913 --> 29:45.878
we can lure Dahlia into a trap,

29:45.879 --> 29:50.382
after which,
I'll kill her myself.

29:50.383 --> 29:54.578
All we need is a vial
of Hope's blood.

30:02.828 --> 30:05.797
I'll give you her blood.

30:05.798 --> 30:09.034
I'm trusting you, Elijah.

30:09.035 --> 30:11.469
The moment our home is safe,

30:11.470 --> 30:13.555
you can return Hope
to where she belongs...

30:16.208 --> 30:17.851
With family.

30:21.513 --> 30:24.883
By all means, think it over,
though know this.

30:24.884 --> 30:26.751
I shall not ask twice.

30:26.752 --> 30:29.321
In my experience, an offer
from a malevolent witch

30:29.322 --> 30:32.023
always comes with a catch.

30:32.024 --> 30:35.692
What's yours?

30:37.862 --> 30:40.865
Hope is all Hayley
will ever have.

30:40.866 --> 30:43.434
She will fight us.
She will not relent.

30:43.435 --> 30:47.005
In order for us to succeed
and live in peace,

30:47.006 --> 30:50.634
Hayley will have
to be eliminated.

30:55.246 --> 30:57.448
You would have me
rob my daughter

30:57.449 --> 31:00.451
of her mother
so she will grow to hate me.

31:00.452 --> 31:02.253
When she grows, you can tell her

31:02.254 --> 31:04.856
whatever story you like,

31:04.857 --> 31:08.459
but in the end, the truth is,

31:08.460 --> 31:12.405
you will have made
the right choice for her.

31:41.459 --> 31:43.993
G'ugh!

32:01.755 --> 32:03.456
The pack's gathering
for the funeral.

32:03.457 --> 32:05.991
They're just waiting
on one more.

32:12.131 --> 32:16.668
You, Aiden, and Ollie

32:17.737 --> 32:20.239
yeah. We were like brothers,

32:20.240 --> 32:23.408
always looking out
for each other.

32:25.545 --> 32:27.947
Hayley, before you came
to New Orleans,

32:27.948 --> 32:31.017
our pack chose me
not just to lead them,

32:31.018 --> 32:33.552
but to stand for them.

32:33.553 --> 32:35.888
We've lost too many to
the Mikaelsons this year,

32:35.889 --> 32:39.425
and Elijah wants you to go
back to their family

32:39.426 --> 32:42.093
when this is all over...

32:43.896 --> 32:45.798
But I can't live
under Klaus' roof

32:45.799 --> 32:48.346
and be the Alpha
this pack deserves.

32:48.347 --> 32:50.336
What are you saying, Jack?

32:50.337 --> 32:52.805
I love you and Hope,

32:52.806 --> 32:56.308
and I will honor
our vows always,

32:56.309 --> 32:59.611
but I need to know
who your family is.

32:59.612 --> 33:01.780
If you want to go back
to the Mikaelsons',

33:01.781 --> 33:04.516
I can't go with you.

33:04.517 --> 33:06.652
If they really are your family,

33:06.653 --> 33:09.120
then I got to protect my own.

33:18.615 --> 33:21.699
I'll give you
some time to think.

33:49.394 --> 33:52.164
I don't need time, Jack.

33:52.165 --> 33:54.199
I spent my whole life
searching for family,

33:54.200 --> 33:58.036
and I found you and the pack.

33:58.037 --> 34:00.271
We need to do right by them...

34:01.773 --> 34:03.174
Starting with Aiden.

34:08.791 --> 34:11.081
I told Josh where
he could find us.

34:15.589 --> 34:18.021
Let him through.

34:43.367 --> 34:46.284
Once the spell is set,
Dahlia won't be able to enter

34:46.284 --> 34:49.219
without being rendered mortal.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.856
Where's the child, Elijah?

34:51.857 --> 34:53.524
If we use her power
to lure Dahlia,

34:53.525 --> 34:56.594
swear to me that Hope
will come to no harm.

34:56.594 --> 34:59.630
Dahlia won't get close
enough to hurt Hope.

34:59.631 --> 35:04.235
She won't be able to hurt
any child ever again.

35:04.236 --> 35:05.735
Uh!

35:07.516 --> 35:09.740
I do hope that is true.

35:09.741 --> 35:12.409
You are now the bait.

35:13.878 --> 35:16.212
What did you do to me?

35:16.214 --> 35:18.079
Hope's blood is now in you.

35:18.080 --> 35:21.152
Therefore, Dahlia will
now be hunting you.

35:21.153 --> 35:23.654
All we needed was
a beating heart,

35:23.655 --> 35:25.789
and though I question the purity

35:25.790 --> 35:27.391
of your heart's intent,

35:27.392 --> 35:29.426
I hear it beating just fine.

35:29.427 --> 35:32.630
No. If Dahlia senses a ruse...

35:32.631 --> 35:34.431
Rebekah assures me
that this will work,

35:34.432 --> 35:36.000
and I trust her far more
than I trust you.

35:36.001 --> 35:37.334
I am not your enemy, Elijah.

35:37.335 --> 35:38.435
We shall see.

35:38.436 --> 35:40.670
Proceed with your preparations.

35:59.689 --> 36:04.042
I ain't seen a spell
like that in a long time.

36:04.043 --> 36:06.961
It's pretty brave
for someone so young,

36:06.962 --> 36:08.671
even a harvest girl.

36:08.672 --> 36:10.554
What are you doing here?

36:10.555 --> 36:12.156
Ha ha!

36:12.157 --> 36:15.359
Well, I mean, that's
a loaded question for me,

36:15.360 --> 36:19.015
but you seem to be exactly
where you supposed to be.

36:19.016 --> 36:21.932
Are you sure you can
do this on your own?

36:21.933 --> 36:23.967
Don't remember asking for help.

36:23.968 --> 36:28.805
Heh. No.
You didn't.

36:28.806 --> 36:31.007
I'm asking for yours.

36:33.844 --> 36:36.113
Davina, the covens
need a leader,

36:36.114 --> 36:39.383
and they want to bestow
that title unto me.

36:39.384 --> 36:41.652
I'm not into that.
They're getting pushy.

36:41.653 --> 36:43.220
So I'm inclined to present them

36:43.221 --> 36:45.822
with an alternative...
Someone who's got faith,

36:45.823 --> 36:48.292
someone... someone
who'll use the craft

36:48.293 --> 36:51.328
to help people...
and from what I hear,

36:51.329 --> 36:53.397
you seem to fit
that description pretty well.

36:53.398 --> 36:57.134
I walked away from my coven.

36:57.135 --> 37:00.181
I'm talking about
a direct connection

37:00.182 --> 37:02.239
to the ancestors from
all 9 of the covens.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.674
I'm talking about
voodoo, hoodoo,

37:04.675 --> 37:08.245
sacrificial magic,
representational magic.

37:08.246 --> 37:11.447
I'm talking about necromancing.

37:12.724 --> 37:14.851
Yeah.

37:14.852 --> 37:18.255
See, that's a whole
lot of power, huh,

37:18.256 --> 37:20.857
and you're gonna need
a hell of a lot more

37:20.858 --> 37:22.759
than this here rock

37:22.760 --> 37:25.060
if you ever want to get
your boyfriend back.

38:04.151 --> 38:06.602
I never thought much
about the whole

38:06.603 --> 38:08.805
immortality part
of being a vampire.

38:08.806 --> 38:13.805
Suddenly, forever feels
like a really long time.

38:59.622 --> 39:02.558
Hayley, voice-over: Elijah,

39:02.559 --> 39:05.026
I'm calling to say good-bye.

39:11.099 --> 39:16.098
Hope and I, we can't be part
of your family anymore.

39:16.472 --> 39:20.141
All Hope's life, her family
has tried to destroy her.

39:22.711 --> 39:26.748
That can't be
my little girl's story.

39:26.749 --> 39:30.623
Family is supposed to love you.

39:30.624 --> 39:33.722
Even if she is free
of Dahlia's firstborn curse,

39:33.723 --> 39:36.458
Hope would still
be Klaus' daughter.

39:36.459 --> 39:39.094
She'd inherit
1,000 years of enemies,

39:39.095 --> 39:42.464
all his anger and rage.

39:42.465 --> 39:45.766
I don't want Hope
to be a Mikaelson.

39:47.035 --> 39:50.005
All the pain that comes
with that name,

39:50.006 --> 39:52.908
she doesn't deserve that.

39:52.909 --> 39:54.943
Elijah,

39:54.944 --> 39:56.846
good-bye.

40:04.053 --> 40:06.814
She's right, Elijah.

40:31.612 --> 40:36.350
I knew you were the smartest
of your siblings.

40:36.351 --> 40:40.722
No brute viking blood
in those veins.

40:40.723 --> 40:43.691
I'm glad to see you
made the right decision.

40:43.692 --> 40:47.795
I never cared for Hayley,

40:47.796 --> 40:50.865
but you should know,
the rest of my family

40:50.866 --> 40:55.102
will stand against us
in defense of her.

40:55.103 --> 40:59.207
We will have to go through them.

40:59.208 --> 41:01.608
Are you prepared for that?

41:05.279 --> 41:10.278
They have more than earned
everything that is to come.

41:14.755 --> 41:16.824
We need to hurry.

41:16.825 --> 41:20.361
Even now, Hayley is
attempting to flee

41:20.362 --> 41:22.443
with my child.

41:22.444 --> 41:24.831
Hmm, don't worry.

41:27.935 --> 41:30.937
She won't get far tonight.
