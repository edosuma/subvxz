09:58.088 --> 09:59.931
I love it!

10:03.719 --> 10:04.719
Welcome back to
"Legends of the Hidden Temple."

10:04.795 --> 10:06.471
Ah! How you guys doing?

10:06.546 --> 10:09.265
- Yes!
- [cheers and laughter]

10:09.341 --> 10:12.518
Red Jaguars, you were first
across the moat.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.645
Do you think
you have what it takes

10:13.654 --> 10:15.480
to conquer
the Steps of Knowledge?

10:15.489 --> 10:17.774
I think that what really saw us
through the first time around

10:17.849 --> 10:19.275
was our listening
and following directions,

10:19.351 --> 10:22.320
so I would say we are ready

10:22.330 --> 10:24.831
to listen, to comprehend,
and answer.

10:24.907 --> 10:26.449
So you're basically
saying that prepped you

10:26.459 --> 10:28.418
for this right now.

10:28.494 --> 10:31.296
- You haven't seen nothing yet.
- Okay! Okay!

10:31.372 --> 10:35.166
I definitely think that
because we came in first,

10:35.242 --> 10:37.752
there might be a little bit
of a target on our backs.

10:37.828 --> 10:39.304
CRISTELA: We saw how fast
you were crossing the moat.

10:39.380 --> 10:42.599
Now let's see how smart you are
on the steps.

10:42.642 --> 10:46.386
So listen carefully
as Olmec tells you more

10:46.461 --> 10:50.315
of the Legend of the Golden Torc
of Freyja. Olmec?

10:50.391 --> 10:53.976
Freyja grows tired
of her perfect bedchamber

10:54.052 --> 10:57.188
and leaves Asgard
in search of adventure.

10:57.198 --> 11:00.867
Just then,
Thor and his frenemy, Loki,

11:00.943 --> 11:01.818
desperately need her.

11:01.893 --> 11:05.038
They go to Odin.

11:05.114 --> 11:08.333
Where's Freyja?
This idiot lost his hammer.

11:08.376 --> 11:12.078
She is the only one who can
help me get it back.

11:12.088 --> 11:15.715
She has gone to see
the jeweler dwarves.

11:15.791 --> 11:17.041
OLMEC: Freyja is enchanted

11:17.051 --> 11:20.211
by an incredible one-piece
golden necklace,

11:20.221 --> 11:22.880
created by three dwarves.

11:22.890 --> 11:25.800
It is so special,
it has a name--

11:25.876 --> 11:29.053
The Brísingamen Torc.

11:29.129 --> 11:30.388
As stunned by the torc

11:30.464 --> 11:33.224
as the dwarves are
by Freyja's beauty,

11:33.234 --> 11:37.862
she insists she must have it
and demands the price.

11:37.938 --> 11:41.190
Price? [laughs]
How about more time with you?

11:41.266 --> 11:43.234
You can't stay the night?

11:43.244 --> 11:45.987
OLMEC:
To the dwarves' great surprise,

11:45.996 --> 11:49.240
Freyja agrees to stay the night

11:49.250 --> 11:51.200
with each of them.

11:51.276 --> 11:54.036
She leaves with the shining
Golden Torc around her neck,

11:54.112 --> 11:57.039
which becomes her trademark.

11:57.115 --> 11:59.041
On the way back to Asgard,

11:59.117 --> 12:01.711
Freyja hears a poor farmer
praying to her

12:01.787 --> 12:05.089
at a giant stone altar.

12:05.099 --> 12:09.185
Great Freyja,
deliver me from poverty.

12:09.261 --> 12:11.095
OLMEC: He slaughter an ox
as a sacrifice,

12:11.105 --> 12:14.557
impressing Freyja
with his devotion.

12:14.633 --> 12:17.226
So she sets out
to answer his prayers,

12:17.302 --> 12:19.729
calling in Heide, a magic witch,

12:19.805 --> 12:25.359
who performs
a 23andMe incantation...

12:25.435 --> 12:29.322
Royal blood flows like wine
through your veins.

12:29.397 --> 12:33.451
OLMEC: revealing the poor man
is actually royalty.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.795
Okay, Freyja,
can I kill him now?

12:35.871 --> 12:38.289
By the way, nice torc.

12:38.365 --> 12:40.759
Over my dead body.

12:40.801 --> 12:43.461
OLMEC: An epic battle ensues,

12:43.471 --> 12:46.422
and Freyja triumphs over Heide,
lashing out.

12:46.498 --> 12:51.803
This good human shall drink
only good drink.

12:51.878 --> 12:53.805
OLMEC: The farmer pulls himself
out of poverty

12:53.814 --> 12:56.307
and drinks nothing
but the finest wine

12:56.317 --> 12:59.268
for the rest of his days.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.938
Meanwhile,
Freyja returns to Asgard,

13:02.013 --> 13:04.783
where Thor and Loki are waiting.

13:06.810 --> 13:10.238
CRISTELA: You are standing
at the Steps of Knowledge.

13:10.313 --> 13:12.114
Olmec will be asking you
questions

13:12.190 --> 13:13.416
about the legend you just heard.

13:13.492 --> 13:15.284
He will also ask
general knowledge questions

13:15.360 --> 13:17.662
related to the story.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.705
Once he's done asking
the question,

13:19.715 --> 13:21.457
stomp on the ancient mark
in front of you.

13:21.533 --> 13:23.334
If correct, you are able
to take a step down.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.795
If you are wrong, though,
or take too long,

13:25.871 --> 13:28.047
the other teams have a chance.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.216
The first two teams
to reach the bottom

13:30.226 --> 13:32.176
move forward
to the Temple Games.

13:32.186 --> 13:35.355
The team that is last
will be out.

13:35.430 --> 13:36.472
I think, you know,
once we get up there,

13:36.548 --> 13:38.024
we do well under pressure,
you know?

13:38.100 --> 13:40.527
So you saw it in the moat.
You're gonna see it here.

13:40.602 --> 13:43.029
You know, and we're just gonna
take it one step at a time.

13:43.105 --> 13:45.439
We brushed up on our trivia
before we got here.

13:45.515 --> 13:48.442
Um... all right, that's a lie.

13:48.518 --> 13:50.278
[laughs] But whatever.
Who cares?
