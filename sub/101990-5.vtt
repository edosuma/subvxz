00:03.003 --> 00:05.380
MONICA: Dr. Harley, where's my mom?

00:05.464 --> 00:07.132
Maria died three years ago.

00:07.216 --> 00:09.384
Two years after you disappeared.

HAYWARD: The program hasn't been the same
since you've been up there,Rambeau.

00:14.765 --> 00:17.559
The FBI is in a tizzy up in Jersey...

00:17.643 --> 00:21.063
This isn't a missing person's case,
Captain Rambeau, it's a missing town.

00:21.146 --> 00:22.981
Some sort of energy field.

00:25.025 --> 00:28.278
My equipment registered
an extremely high level of CMBR.

00:28.362 --> 00:30.239
Entwined was a broadcast frequency.

00:30.322 --> 00:32.198
Voila, sound and picture.

00:32.281 --> 00:34.076

01:40.934 --> 01:45.522

I promise you will be my favorite twin.

01:45.606 --> 01:47.191
Oh, come on now, darling.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.734
You know we love them both equally.

-Well, don't tell him that.
-(VISION CHUCKLES)

01:51.445 --> 01:52.487

01:52.571 --> 01:54.281
Tried reading to him,
but for some reason,

01:54.364 --> 01:57.284
Charles Darwin's The Descent of Man
made him cry even harder.

01:57.367 --> 02:00.329

calls for one, don't you?

03:43.098 --> 03:45.517
Very well.
But be careful of their belly buttons

and remember
to support their heads,

03:47.144 --> 03:48.854

08:15.913 --> 08:18.624
This hopeless feeling.

(CHUCKLES) No, no, no. We're done here.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.931
She does that. See you at the briefing.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.227
HAYWARD: Morning.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.438
We are now assessing a more clear picture
of this crisis.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.399
And thanks to Captain Rambeau,

09:25.482 --> 09:30.070
we now have first-person intel
from inside the Westview Anomaly.

09:30.153 --> 09:33.866
Our initial theory had
Wanda Maximoff as one of many victims.

09:33.949 --> 09:36.827
We now know
she is the principal victimizer.

09:37.578 --> 09:38.787
Jimmy.

09:39.788 --> 09:41.331
WOO: Quick history on our subject.

09:41.415 --> 09:45.919
Born in Sokovia in 1989
to Irina and Oleg Maximoff,

09:46.003 --> 09:47.629
both killed during an air raid

09:47.713 --> 09:50.591
when Maximoff
and her twin brother, Pietro, were ten.

09:50.674 --> 09:54.136
HAYWARD: The twins were subsequently
radicalized, volunteering at HYDRA.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.556
It's an oversimplification
of events, but, yes.

09:57.639 --> 10:01.101
After unspecified experimentation
with the Mind Stone,

10:01.185 --> 10:05.147
Maximoff gained
telekinetic and telepathic abilities.

10:05.230 --> 10:08.358
Back up, Jimmy.
Does Maximoff have an alias?

10:09.401 --> 10:11.361
-No, sir.
-No funny nickname?

10:11.445 --> 10:12.696
Not a one.

10:12.779 --> 10:15.824
And earliest tracking had her using
her powers against the Avengers.

10:15.908 --> 10:16.909
Is that correct?

10:16.992 --> 10:20.162
Right before she earned their trust
and became one herself.

10:20.996 --> 10:24.708
HAYWARD: Lagos and Germany,
we all know how that turned out.

10:25.501 --> 10:26.627
Thanks, Jimmy.

10:29.296 --> 10:32.216
Now that we have the lay of the land,
let's talk about strategy.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.300
It is the policy...

10:33.383 --> 10:35.052
(SOFTLY) I try
not to speak ill of people...

10:35.135 --> 10:36.637
Then allow me. Hayward's a...

10:36.720 --> 10:37.804
...terrorists.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.848
Wanda's not a terrorist.

10:39.932 --> 10:42.226
HAYWARD: By your own account,
you described the experience

10:42.309 --> 10:45.354
of being under her mind-control as

10:45.437 --> 10:48.565
"excruciating, terrifying, a violation."

10:50.067 --> 10:52.319
GERALDINE: Wanda, what's up?

10:53.904 --> 10:55.989
And now that I've gone all corporate...

10:56.073 --> 10:59.409
My point is, I don't believe
she has a political agenda

10:59.493 --> 11:01.370
or any inclination toward destruction.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.622
Monica, she blasted you
halfway across New Jersey.

11:03.705 --> 11:05.874
And I survived
because she chose to protect me.

11:05.958 --> 11:08.627
She's holding thousands of people hostage.

11:08.710 --> 11:12.256
And it could have been thousands more
if she hadn't put up her own quarantine.

11:13.131 --> 11:17.010
Listen, I don't believe
this is a premeditated act of aggression.

11:17.094 --> 11:18.345
HAYWARD: You don't?

11:19.471 --> 11:20.681
Bring up the visual.

11:22.933 --> 11:25.185
This morning,
I received authorization to share

11:25.269 --> 11:28.188

Take the shot.

23:25.489 --> 23:27.157
What did you do?

23:27.241 --> 23:28.617
AGENT: There's a breach, sir.

24:21.253 --> 24:22.462
Is this yours?

24:24.548 --> 24:26.300
(FIZZING)

24:30.470 --> 24:33.056
The missile was just a precaution.

24:33.140 --> 24:35.475
You can hardly blame us, Wanda.

24:35.559 --> 24:37.186
WANDA: Oh, I think I can.

24:38.061 --> 24:40.814
This will be your only warning.

24:42.232 --> 24:44.026
Stay out of my home.

24:44.902 --> 24:48.363
You don't bother me. I won't bother you.

24:48.447 --> 24:50.157
I wish it could be that simple.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.118
You've taken an entire town hostage.

24:53.202 --> 24:55.746
Well, I'm not the one
with the guns, Director.

24:56.455 --> 24:58.582
MONICA: But you are the one in control.

25:00.959 --> 25:02.461
You're still here.

25:05.923 --> 25:09.927
MONICA: Wanda, I didn't know
the drones were armed.

25:10.636 --> 25:12.846
But you know that, don't you?

25:12.930 --> 25:14.681
A town full of civilians.

25:14.765 --> 25:18.602
And you, a telepath,
brought a S.W.O.R.D. Agent into your home.

25:19.269 --> 25:22.189
You trusted me
to help deliver your babies.

25:22.272 --> 25:25.567
On some level, Wanda,
you know I am an ally.

25:26.568 --> 25:27.653
I wanna help you.

25:27.736 --> 25:31.990
How? What could you
possibly have to offer me?

25:33.200 --> 25:34.451
What do you want?

25:35.285 --> 25:36.703
I have what I want

25:38.288 --> 25:42.876
and no one
will ever take it from me again.

25:50.133 --> 25:52.219

-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:52.302 --> 25:53.303

26:21.415 --> 26:22.791

-Oh.

26:23.750 --> 26:25.210
WOMAN: You've got a mess,

26:25.294 --> 26:27.963
and you're still using
the next leading brand.

26:29.464 --> 26:31.800
You need Lagos brand paper towels.

26:31.884 --> 26:34.136
The most absorbent paper towel available.

26:36.430 --> 26:37.806
(SIGHS)

26:39.516 --> 26:41.643
Husbands can use it too, you know.

26:42.853 --> 26:46.857
Lagos. For when you make
a mess you didn't mean to.

26:49.610 --> 26:52.070
TOMMY: Sparky! Come on, boy!

26:52.154 --> 26:54.740
BILLY: Sparky! Sparky!

26:54.823 --> 26:57.784
-Here, boy! Sparky!
-Hey, what's the trouble, little dudes?

26:57.868 --> 26:59.786
-We can't find our dog.
-Ah, don't worry.

26:59.870 --> 27:00.996
He's sure to turn up.

27:01.079 --> 27:04.208
Your mom won't let him get far. Ma'am.

27:05.125 --> 27:06.710
I don't know where he could've gone.

27:06.793 --> 27:07.961
Here, boy!

27:08.045 --> 27:10.172
-Sparky! Sparky!
-Sparky!

27:19.097 --> 27:21.016
-I...
-(GASPS)

27:22.142 --> 27:25.145
I didn't wanna come
until I'd wrapped him up.

27:26.438 --> 27:27.564
What happened to him?

27:27.648 --> 27:29.525
AGNES: Found him in my azalea bushes.

27:29.608 --> 27:31.527
Don't know how many leaves he ate.

27:31.610 --> 27:34.112
I didn't find him until it was too late.

27:35.822 --> 27:36.823
Oh...

27:38.367 --> 27:41.954
Tommy, Billy, I'm so sorry.

27:43.539 --> 27:45.123
Wait. Don't. Don't.

27:45.207 --> 27:47.751
-Don't what?
-Don't age yourselves up.

27:47.835 --> 27:52.506
The urge to run
from this feeling is powerful.

27:52.589 --> 27:53.715
I know.

27:55.759 --> 27:57.177
It's too sad.

27:57.928 --> 28:01.598
You can fix anything, Mom. Fix the dead.

28:03.183 --> 28:04.268
What?

28:06.937 --> 28:07.938
No.

28:09.356 --> 28:10.732
You can do that?

28:15.571 --> 28:18.448
I am trying to tell you

28:18.532 --> 28:21.827
that there are rules in life, okay?

28:21.910 --> 28:26.498
We can't rush aging
just because it's convenient. (CHUCKLES)

28:27.541 --> 28:31.670
And we can't reverse death.

28:32.671 --> 28:34.464
No matter how sad it makes us.

28:35.340 --> 28:37.342
Okay? Some things are forever.

28:38.302 --> 28:40.596
-(SIGHS)
-You said family is forever.

28:40.679 --> 28:42.931
TOMMY: He is family.

28:43.015 --> 28:44.725
Bring him back, Mom.

(SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING)

29:21.178 --> 29:22.554
How are the boys?

29:23.847 --> 29:26.016
A little heartbroken,
but they'll be all right.

29:30.979 --> 29:35.817
Well, it's not often you get a dog
and bury them the same day.

29:35.901 --> 29:38.820
Well, life moves pretty fast
out in the suburbs.

29:43.450 --> 29:44.910
I spoke with Norm.

29:45.494 --> 29:46.495
Oh?

29:47.371 --> 29:49.456
I unearthed the man's
suppressed personality

29:49.540 --> 29:51.750
and I spoke to him free of your oversight.

29:53.252 --> 29:54.586
He was in pain, Wanda.

29:56.088 --> 29:57.756

29:58.757 --> 30:00.634
-Listen, can we just...
-VISION: What?

30:01.927 --> 30:03.095
Watch TV?

30:04.012 --> 30:07.891
Turn in for the night so that
you can change everything over again?

30:07.975 --> 30:09.184
No, Wanda.

30:10.561 --> 30:12.729
You can't control me the way you do them.

30:14.606 --> 30:15.858
Can't I?

30:15.941 --> 30:18.068
(MUSIC PLAYING)

30:18.151 --> 30:20.445

30:20.529 --> 30:21.738

30:21.822 --> 30:23.657
VISION: No! We're not done here.

30:25.117 --> 30:27.369
What is the "Maximoff Anomaly"?

30:27.452 --> 30:28.453
The what?

30:29.246 --> 30:32.040
I have to believe
that this, whatever this is,

30:32.124 --> 30:33.542
was subconscious at first

30:33.625 --> 30:36.170
and that you only
recently became aware of it.

30:36.253 --> 30:38.714
Aware of what?

30:38.797 --> 30:40.674
-Norm has a family, Wanda!
-(ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)

30:40.757 --> 30:42.885
He has a family, and he can't reach them

30:42.968 --> 30:46.346
-because you won't let him reach them!
-I don't know what you're talking about!

30:46.430 --> 30:48.056
Stop lying to me!

-(ELECTRICITY BUZZING)
-This, all of this is for us.

30:54.354 --> 30:56.648
So let me handle it.

30:56.732 --> 30:58.567
What is outside of Westview?

31:00.068 --> 31:01.904
You don't wanna know, I promise you.

31:01.987 --> 31:05.157
You don't get to make
that choice for me, Wanda!

31:06.867 --> 31:09.244
You've never talked to me
like this before.

31:09.328 --> 31:12.080
Before what? (VOICE RISES) Before what?

31:12.164 --> 31:14.374
I can't remember my life before Westview.

(BUZZING STOPS)

31:20.005 --> 31:22.549
You are my husband.

31:24.343 --> 31:26.887
You are Tommy and Billy's father.

31:26.970 --> 31:28.680
Isn't that enough?

31:33.685 --> 31:36.188
Wanda, why are there
no other children in Westview?

31:36.271 --> 31:38.065
Oh, God! There are! Just stop it!

31:38.148 --> 31:39.316
No. No.

31:39.983 --> 31:43.195
The playground stands empty
every morning I walk to work.

31:43.278 --> 31:44.363
Why? Tell me why?

31:44.446 --> 31:47.491
Do you really think
that I am controlling everything?

31:48.575 --> 31:52.287
That I am somehow
in charge of everybody in Westview?

31:52.371 --> 31:54.122
I'm walking their dogs,
mowing their lawns,

31:54.206 --> 31:56.291

dentist appointments on time?

I don't know how any of this started
in the first place.

Wanda, what you're doing here, it's wrong.

32:25.696 --> 32:27.197
You don't believe me.

32:27.281 --> 32:31.702

I'm ignoring statistics entirely.
