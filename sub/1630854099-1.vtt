distribute money.

08:33.149 --> 08:34.984
And you have kidnapped me.

09:35.816 --> 09:38.982
'Cause a promise
is, it's a promise.

09:41.756 --> 09:43.283
- Then you ditch your truck.

You'll avoid the cops and you

09:53.097 --> 09:55.031

09:55.066 --> 09:58.738
But, uh, the truck,
it's my brother's truck.

09:58.773 --> 10:01.070
And all I keep thinking is
that if he'd taken that tank

10:01.105 --> 10:02.841
the night of the accident
instead of the sedan,

10:02.876 --> 10:05.272
the entire family would
probably still be alive.

10:05.307 --> 10:07.373
Besides, it's kinda sentimental
to me now, you know?

10:07.408 --> 10:09.243
And you shot out
the rear window.

10:11.720 --> 10:13.082
- Oh, I did, didn't I?

10:13.117 --> 10:14.446
- Mm hm.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.217
- Sorry about that.

10:16.252 --> 10:19.187
- I'm a straight
shooter, all right?

10:19.222 --> 10:21.695
Guys like me don't
go out and run.

10:21.730 --> 10:24.324
I gotta go back to
the cops, end of story.

10:26.999 --> 10:28.196
- Okay.

10:28.231 --> 10:30.770
Well, um, that's your choice.

10:30.805 --> 10:32.365
But I am gonna pay
for that window.

10:32.400 --> 10:34.103
I just need a minute.

10:34.138 --> 10:35.808
- You don't need to do that.

10:38.175 --> 10:39.779
Oh my God.

10:58.767 --> 11:00.767
- I was told 15 minutes tops.

11:00.802 --> 11:02.131
The cops have come and gone.

11:02.166 --> 11:03.770
Had to pay them off myself.

11:11.175 --> 11:12.207
- Do you know who I am?

11:13.815 --> 11:14.880
- I know you're late.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.246
- They call me Ask.

11:18.281 --> 11:20.182
Do you know why
they call me that?

11:21.922 --> 11:23.350
- No.

11:23.385 --> 11:25.253
- Because everybody
in the syndicate knows

11:25.288 --> 11:29.455
if they want anything,
and I do mean anything,

11:29.490 --> 11:34.262
they come to me
first and they ask.

11:34.297 --> 11:37.969
- Well, Ask, I'm the boss's
son, so I don't care.

11:45.143 --> 11:46.472
- She owes us a nine millimeter.

11:46.507 --> 11:48.045
You can add it to your tab.

11:55.252 --> 11:57.252
Being that I'm the top
fixer in this operation

11:57.287 --> 12:00.189
and I say that with
remarkable modesty,

12:00.224 --> 12:01.894
I would rather be doing

12:01.929 --> 12:05.194
just about anything
besides babysitting you.

12:05.229 --> 12:06.932
- Yo, maybe if your guys
hadn't messed up the hit

12:06.967 --> 12:08.395
you wouldn't have to.

12:08.430 --> 12:10.496

these are my goons?

12:12.203 --> 12:14.808
No, sweetheart, these
are your father's goons.

12:16.207 --> 12:20.341
These are the
goons that he hired

12:20.376 --> 12:24.378

behind the cash register.

12:28.153 --> 12:30.285

- Yes.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.990

12:32.025 --> 12:34.289

12:54.344 --> 12:55.310
- Natasha.

12:55.345 --> 12:57.048
- Natasha.

12:57.083 --> 12:58.445
To clear up this trouble

12:58.480 --> 13:00.051
that you've got going
on with Natasha,

13:00.086 --> 13:01.987
and to do it with
any honor at all,

13:02.022 --> 13:04.319
you're gonna have to hunt her
down and kill her yourself.

13:06.257 --> 13:07.421
- You
enjoy your meal?

13:07.456 --> 13:08.521
- More than I did the company.

13:08.556 --> 13:10.127
- Aw, having a bad day?

13:10.162 --> 13:11.458
- Thank you
for your money.

13:11.493 --> 13:12.833
- I'm just trying
not to get shot.

13:14.496 --> 13:15.627
- Okay.

13:17.939 --> 13:22.502
- So, then I'm
seeing a lot of violence.

13:22.537 --> 13:24.108
I can afford it,
I can afford it.

13:36.287 --> 13:38.551
- James Randolph.

13:40.522 --> 13:41.928
- I prefer Jimmy.

13:43.063 --> 13:44.161
- I prefer Rudolph.

13:44.196 --> 13:45.558
♪ Just a second ♪

13:45.593 --> 13:47.934
You're in a sticky
situation, Rudolph.

13:47.969 --> 13:49.595
Let's be honest about it.

13:49.630 --> 13:53.335
If you go on the road, you're
an accessory to murder.

13:53.370 --> 13:58.604
If you go back to the cops,
well, you're a snitch.

13:58.639 --> 14:00.639
- Accessory to murder?

14:00.674 --> 14:02.575
You're dropping the
whole self-defense thing?

14:04.348 --> 14:06.315
- A nice clean-cut guy like you?

14:06.350 --> 14:08.416
Honey, this ain't your world.

14:08.451 --> 14:10.957
I mean, you saw how out of
depth you were back there,

14:10.992 --> 14:13.388
how you handled it.

14:15.128 --> 14:17.194
Here's how it's gonna
go with you and me.

14:17.229 --> 14:18.492
You can't ditch the truck.

14:18.527 --> 14:20.197
I get that.

14:20.232 --> 14:23.167
But I can offer you
protection on the road.

14:23.202 --> 14:26.170
In exchange, you give me a ride.

14:26.205 --> 14:27.600
You get to pay your respects,

14:27.635 --> 14:29.602
I catch the slow boat
over the horizon.

14:29.637 --> 14:31.505
That's the deal I'm offering.

14:31.540 --> 14:33.408
Take it or leave it.

14:34.675 --> 14:37.511
- So, we'd go all the way?

14:37.546 --> 14:39.051
All the way to the coast?

14:39.086 --> 14:40.547
- Until you're
sippin' saltwater.

14:40.582 --> 14:43.418
♪ Sorry I'm a junkie
just like you ♪

14:43.453 --> 14:46.454
- You certainly seem like
you can handle yourself.

14:46.489 --> 14:49.226
- I was raised by a sheriff
in a small town in Utah.

14:49.261 --> 14:50.997
You could say I learned
a few things growin' up.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.528
- I could use the protection.

14:54.563 --> 14:57.564
- Oh, I insist you
use protection.

14:57.599 --> 15:00.138
♪ I'm just here for a ride ♪

15:04.045 --> 15:06.045
- Oh.

15:06.080 --> 15:08.377
If you insist.

15:08.412 --> 15:10.951
- Hm, nice to ride
with you, Rudolph.

15:12.350 --> 15:13.481
Call me Tasha.

15:13.516 --> 15:18.288
♪ I'm just here for a ride ♪

15:21.656 --> 15:25.460
♪ I'm just here for a ride ♪

15:36.605 --> 15:39.408
- Look, I still think we
should check the local area.

15:39.443 --> 15:41.113
- Ah ha.

15:45.812 --> 15:47.152
- Islands?

15:47.187 --> 15:48.417
- The Hawaiian Islands.

15:48.452 --> 15:50.353
She's gone to Hawaii.

15:50.388 --> 15:52.058
- Wait, you think just
because she has a postcard

15:52.093 --> 15:53.554
of Hawaii that that's
where she's going?

15:53.589 --> 15:56.260
It's that simple?
- Yeah, it is that simple.

15:56.295 --> 15:57.591
She's not Jason Bourne.

15:57.626 --> 15:59.296
She's a grifter
from the Midwest.

15:59.331 --> 16:01.166
She probably struggles
to spell her own name.

16:01.201 --> 16:02.530
- Okay, so how
does that help us?

16:02.565 --> 16:03.630
It's not like we
can check every car

16:03.665 --> 16:05.005
on the way to the coast.

16:08.835 --> 16:10.274
Hello?

16:17.679 --> 16:19.547
I thought we didn't
have CCTV here?

16:19.582 --> 16:20.713
Be incriminating.

16:20.748 --> 16:22.517
- We have no official CCTV.

16:22.552 --> 16:24.684
This is a little somethin'
we have as a backup

16:24.719 --> 16:27.522
in case of a
situation like this.

16:27.557 --> 16:28.623
- Why is this news to me?

16:30.626 --> 16:33.165
- Oh, now you're talkin'
like a mob boss .

16:33.200 --> 16:35.563
Ah! Oo, right there.

16:37.633 --> 16:38.635
Whoa.

16:42.506 --> 16:46.145
Whew .

16:46.180 --> 16:47.443
- She's done that before.

16:47.478 --> 16:48.543
- Mm, like it's routine.

16:49.513 --> 16:50.512
Here we go.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.482
Mm hm.

16:53.517 --> 16:55.814
Okay, here we go.

17:02.724 --> 17:03.657
Whew.

17:05.628 --> 17:08.332
Okay.

17:10.303 --> 17:13.766
There you go, dark green,
late '90s 'Burb headed west

17:13.801 --> 17:15.504
with a feisty little brat,

17:15.539 --> 17:17.176
and a guy that
looks like he still

17:17.211 --> 17:18.705
has to sleep with
the bedroom light on.

17:18.740 --> 17:23.644
Oh, well, pack your
lunch box, kiddo.

17:23.679 --> 17:25.316
This is gonna be a
walk in the park.

17:25.351 --> 17:26.647
We'll send some goods ahead.

17:29.553 --> 17:31.322
Animal cracker?

17:33.854 --> 17:35.755
- So, Einstein's general
theory of relativity

17:35.790 --> 17:37.757
is based off of classic
physics framework.

17:37.792 --> 17:39.528
But you can't use
that understanding

17:39.563 --> 17:41.299
of gravity within
quantum physics.

17:41.334 --> 17:42.894
You have to use quantum gravity

17:42.929 --> 17:45.699
in order to encompass the
non-gravitational forces.

17:45.734 --> 17:47.536
- Yeah, would you be careful
of that near the interior?

17:47.571 --> 17:49.340
- Yeah, I am being careful.

17:49.375 --> 17:52.244
So, that brings us
to string theory.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.839
Well, actually to
superstring theory

17:53.874 --> 17:55.643
which just brings us to
straight M theory anyway,

17:55.678 --> 17:58.382
which gives us the
flat dimensions.

17:58.417 --> 17:59.746
- You're gonna spill it.

17:59.781 --> 18:02.353
- Do I look like
a five-year-old?

18:02.388 --> 18:03.519
The point that
I'm trying to make

18:03.554 --> 18:05.917
is that space and time coexist

18:05.952 --> 18:09.294
and intertwine at the same
time, which means right now,

18:09.329 --> 18:10.691
like literally, right now,

18:10.726 --> 18:12.594
we could be sharing
the space we're in

18:12.629 --> 18:13.694
with dinosaurs who are
alive and roaming the world

18:13.729 --> 18:15.927
and we wouldn't even know it.

18:15.962 --> 18:17.500
Oops.

18:17.535 --> 18:18.699
- See? Tasha!

18:20.406 --> 18:21.669
- Please call me Nat.

18:22.705 --> 18:23.737
- Fine.

18:23.772 --> 18:25.574
Nat, are you on drugs?

18:25.609 --> 18:26.905
- Huh?

18:26.940 --> 18:28.346
- Because you are
run hot and cold

18:28.381 --> 18:29.413
more than a cheap motel shower.

18:29.448 --> 18:31.580
- So, you've noticed?

18:31.615 --> 18:33.582
- If you're on
drugs, I'm out, okay?

18:33.617 --> 18:34.682
There's a line I will not cross.

18:34.717 --> 18:37.586
- No, I'm not on drugs.

18:37.621 --> 18:39.654
I have dissociative
identity disorder.

18:42.857 --> 18:44.923
A split personality.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.596
- Oh, so you're schizophrenic?

18:47.631 --> 18:50.632
- No, it's different.

18:50.667 --> 18:52.898
My brain is wired with two
different personalities,

18:52.933 --> 18:55.604
each with their own skills,
mannerisms, et cetera,

18:55.639 --> 18:57.210
except for shared memories.

18:57.245 --> 18:58.574
Minus the short-term stuff.

18:58.609 --> 18:59.938
I mean, that can
get a little sketchy

18:59.973 --> 19:02.578
but it does all come
back eventually.

19:02.613 --> 19:04.613
- So, you're Nat?

19:05.649 --> 19:06.813
- Yes.

19:06.848 --> 19:09.255
- And sometimes you're Tasha?

19:09.290 --> 19:11.290
- Exactly.

19:11.325 --> 19:12.885
- How do you even
begin to fix that?

19:14.658 --> 19:17.692
- Well, maybe you
don't fix it at all.

19:17.727 --> 19:19.298
Just because somebody
is wired differently

19:19.333 --> 19:22.367
doesn't necessarily
mean they're broken.

19:22.402 --> 19:24.633
- Sorry, I didn't mean
to sound insensitive.

19:24.668 --> 19:26.734
- Oh, no, don't be.

19:26.769 --> 19:28.934
It's a weird thing to
wrap your head around.

19:28.969 --> 19:31.310
It only happens when I
get extremely stressed.

19:33.413 --> 19:34.808
- Well, Nat, I'm pleased to know

19:34.843 --> 19:36.678
I don't stress you out too much.

19:41.850 --> 19:43.916
So, what are you
gonna do when you get

19:43.951 --> 19:46.292
to the coast and
catch that boat?

19:46.327 --> 19:47.788
- I don't know.

19:47.823 --> 19:50.659
I guess I'll see where
the universe takes me.

19:50.694 --> 19:51.858
What about you?

19:51.893 --> 19:53.365
What do you go back to after

19:53.400 --> 19:54.531
you scatter your
brother's ashes?

19:54.566 --> 19:56.500
- Uh...

19:56.535 --> 19:57.963
- Oh my God, the car's on fire!

19:57.998 --> 20:00.339
- No, it's not on
fire, it's overheating.

20:00.374 --> 20:02.671
- How is that any better?
- Oh, I don't know.

20:02.706 --> 20:04.739
Okay, all right.

20:04.774 --> 20:07.038
I gotta handle this.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.380
- It doesn't like you.

20:08.415 --> 20:09.513
- No, it doesn't.

20:25.993 --> 20:27.300
Yeah, it's just great.

20:27.962 --> 20:29.698
Just great.

20:29.733 --> 20:31.304
Car chase really pushed
it right over the edge.

20:33.099 --> 20:34.736
My brother had this
truck for 15 years.

20:34.771 --> 20:36.771
I've had it for two
weeks and I break it.

20:38.808 --> 20:39.873
- I'll get some water.

20:41.844 --> 20:43.613
- No, no, don't waste it.

20:46.750 --> 20:47.815
- Helps if you...

20:47.850 --> 20:48.750
Oh!

20:51.524 --> 20:53.887
- That was our last
bottle, wasn't it?

20:53.922 --> 20:55.691
- Yes.

20:55.726 --> 20:57.055
- Because you drank all
the other ones, didn't ya?

20:57.090 --> 20:59.398
- Also, yes.

20:59.433 --> 21:01.862
It's fine because we're
in the countryside,

21:01.897 --> 21:05.030
so there's, you know,
natural sources everywhere.

21:05.065 --> 21:06.735
- Or we could just find someone

21:06.770 --> 21:09.375
and ask for some help, you know?

21:09.410 --> 21:10.970
- No, no, no.

21:11.005 --> 21:12.609
Remember the whole like
being on the run, thing?

21:12.644 --> 21:14.677
Because I shot someone?

21:14.712 --> 21:16.382
- You're right, right.

21:16.417 --> 21:19.044
Okay, so just make sure
we get enough water

21:19.079 --> 21:20.617
so if it happens again,
we're not screwed.

21:20.652 --> 21:21.849
You know what?

21:21.884 --> 21:22.850
There's a container in the back.

21:22.885 --> 21:24.049
Would you grab it?

21:24.084 --> 21:25.754
It's all the way in the back.

21:28.627 --> 21:29.593
God!

21:34.897 --> 21:36.369
Yeah, that's it.

21:36.404 --> 21:37.931
- Why do you even have this?

21:37.966 --> 21:39.867
- It's my pee bottle.

21:39.902 --> 21:41.473
- Ugh.

21:41.508 --> 21:42.771
- It's clean. I
didn't ever use this.

21:42.806 --> 21:44.036
It's brand new.

21:44.071 --> 21:46.742
- Bet ya tried it on for size.

21:47.811 --> 21:49.514
Ew!

21:49.549 --> 21:50.680
- Maybe I did.

21:52.112 --> 21:56.081
It's the perfect size actually.

21:56.116 --> 21:58.919
- So, you never really told
me what you did for work.

22:00.428 --> 22:02.494
- I'm a forensic accountant.

22:02.529 --> 22:06.564
- Whoa, you never said
anything about forensics.

22:06.599 --> 22:08.159
I don't like getting
involved in that stuff,

22:08.194 --> 22:10.766
and it never really
goes in my favor.

22:10.801 --> 22:14.803
What are you, like CIA, FBI?

22:14.838 --> 22:16.838
- Family law.

22:16.873 --> 22:20.072
I sit in a small office all day
combing through spreadsheets

22:20.107 --> 22:23.878
to assess the assets of couples
in the process of a divorce.

22:23.913 --> 22:26.419
- So, that's what all the
paperwork in your car is for?

22:26.454 --> 22:27.882
I mean, like you
care about it enough

22:27.917 --> 22:29.917
to actually take it
on the road with you?

22:29.952 --> 22:31.556
- It's very important
work, all right?

22:31.591 --> 22:33.492
I was lucky to get
this time off at all.

22:33.527 --> 22:35.791
Anyway, can be interesting
from time to time.

22:35.826 --> 22:36.891
Wait a minute.

22:37.993 --> 22:38.893
Listen.

22:40.666 --> 22:41.566
Water.

22:52.777 --> 22:54.513
- So, what's like,

22:54.548 --> 22:57.516
the most important case
you've ever solved?

22:57.551 --> 22:59.419
- There's this
couple in California.

23:00.851 --> 23:02.818
They owned a real estate
business together.

23:02.853 --> 23:05.491
Millions of dollars was
going into their business.

23:05.526 --> 23:09.462
Anyway, she caught him, you
know, bangin' the secretary.

23:09.497 --> 23:11.860
Files for divorce,
yada, yada, yada.

23:11.895 --> 23:14.467
Nothing unusual until she
checks the business account

23:14.502 --> 23:16.469
and the balance
is less than $100.

23:16.504 --> 23:18.537
- Where'd all the money go?

23:18.572 --> 23:20.671
- Well, the husband managed
to open up a business

23:20.706 --> 23:24.136
with the exact same name
but just in Arizona.

23:24.171 --> 23:25.874
- Oh, no.

23:25.909 --> 23:27.810
- Yeah, you know, a few
changes here and there

23:27.845 --> 23:30.076
in the paperwork
and she never noticed.

23:30.111 --> 23:31.814
And she wouldn't have either

23:31.849 --> 23:33.178
if it wasn't for yours
truly combing through

23:33.213 --> 23:35.048
the past 10 years
of public records,

23:35.083 --> 23:37.589
every sale that
man had ever made.

23:37.624 --> 23:39.118
But it doesn't end there.

23:39.153 --> 23:41.054
When she confronts him about it,

23:41.089 --> 23:42.693
he's complaining of a migraine

23:42.728 --> 23:44.563
so bad he checks
himself in the ER.

23:44.598 --> 23:46.224
They think he's just
another you know,

23:46.259 --> 23:48.259
stressed out businessman
dealing with a divorce.

23:48.294 --> 23:50.261
Give him a pain killer,
send him on his way.

23:50.296 --> 23:51.933
Well, while he was out in front

23:51.968 --> 23:53.803
of the hospital
waiting for the car,

23:53.838 --> 23:57.510
he gets an aneurysm,
drops dead on the sidewalk.

23:59.745 --> 24:02.515
- So, you killed
him with paperwork?

24:02.550 --> 24:04.946
That's the best murder ever.

24:04.981 --> 24:07.916
- No, no, I didn't kill
him with paperwork.

24:07.951 --> 24:08.917
Okay?

24:08.952 --> 24:09.984
Karma.

24:10.019 --> 24:11.018
Karma killed that guy.

24:11.053 --> 24:11.953
Let's go.

I can't believe

25:40.043 --> 25:41.845
I can't believe it!

25:41.880 --> 25:42.714
Oh, damn.

25:42.749 --> 25:43.781
Come on!

25:53.826 --> 25:56.629
I have no idea.

25:56.664 --> 25:58.059
I don't even know what
we're lookin' at here.

25:58.094 --> 25:59.896
I think we're screwed, honestly.

26:05.805 --> 26:08.971
- Oo, it's gettin' a little
steamy over here, Rudolph.

26:09.006 --> 26:10.170
Don't ya think?

26:12.845 --> 26:14.141
- Tasha?

26:15.848 --> 26:17.408
- Oh, I see Nat
got you up to speed

26:17.443 --> 26:19.377
on the whole schizo deal.

26:19.412 --> 26:20.983
You know, it's not
as complicated as
she makes it seem.

26:25.187 --> 26:27.891
Ah, you have a Vortec L-31.

26:29.092 --> 26:30.993
It'll keep on truckin' but only

26:31.028 --> 26:34.062
if you remember to leave the
cooling system after a refill.

26:34.097 --> 26:35.701
The thing's just overstressed.

26:36.836 --> 26:38.066
Allow me.

26:45.339 --> 26:48.010
Three years in the Army
Corps of Engineers.

26:48.045 --> 26:49.209
No biggie.

26:51.378 --> 26:53.081
It's just a quick
hose job, Rudolph.

26:54.480 --> 26:57.085
Plenty more where
that came from.

26:57.120 --> 26:59.791
Ah.

26:59.826 --> 27:01.122
Bueno.

27:02.488 --> 27:04.125
- That's it?
- That's it.

27:15.138 --> 27:16.104
- Nice work.

27:17.239 --> 27:18.238
- What?

27:29.823 --> 27:31.119
- You know, I just don't get

27:31.154 --> 27:32.725
why we have to
kill her, you know?

27:32.760 --> 27:34.386
Doesn't that seem
a bit strong to you?

27:34.421 --> 27:37.059
Couldn't we just punish
her for disobedience?

27:37.094 --> 27:38.324
Killing's over the
top, you know it.

27:38.359 --> 27:40.964
- No, no, no, no, no, no,

27:40.999 --> 27:43.197
there is an order to
this world, Ellis.

27:43.232 --> 27:45.001
And I don't mean
the outside world.

27:45.036 --> 27:48.136
I'm talkin' about our
world, the criminal world.

27:48.171 --> 27:50.138
We have a duty to
maintain that order

27:50.173 --> 27:51.975
or the whole thing falls apart.

27:52.010 --> 27:53.944
You went every single grunt
in the syndicate taking

27:53.979 --> 27:55.143
a little bit off
your bottom line?

27:55.178 --> 27:57.343
- No.
- No, of course not.

27:57.378 --> 27:59.180
It's about sending a message

27:59.215 --> 28:01.149
so everybody knows
who's in power.

28:01.184 --> 28:03.349
It's about never having
any unfinished business

28:03.384 --> 28:06.319
so that everybody knows
whether it's a few cents

28:06.354 --> 28:07.760
or it's a stack of papers.

28:07.795 --> 28:09.421
You will stop at nothing,

28:09.456 --> 28:12.897
and I do mean nothing, even
if it's your own grandma,

28:12.932 --> 28:15.361
to get your pound of
flesh and restore balance.

28:15.396 --> 28:18.232
- Okay, well, maybe
that's not my style.

28:18.267 --> 28:21.873
Maybe as a leader, I don't
want to waste my valuable time

28:21.908 --> 28:23.435
on things that I
couldn't care less about.

28:23.470 --> 28:25.173
- Oh, you care.

28:25.208 --> 28:27.043
You care too much.

28:27.078 --> 28:29.078
It's written all over that
pretty little face of yours.

28:29.113 --> 28:30.981
You just care for
the wrong reasons.

28:31.016 --> 28:32.312
You think I can't see that?

28:32.347 --> 28:33.918
I've been doin'
this for 20 years.

28:33.953 --> 28:35.381
- What are you talking about?

28:35.416 --> 28:37.317
- What I'm saying is
that whatever you feel

28:37.352 --> 28:40.122
for this Natasha girl has
gotta take a backseat to honor.

28:40.157 --> 28:42.795
- Whatever.

28:42.830 --> 28:45.193
She's nothing special.

28:45.228 --> 28:47.833
Do you have any idea
the kind of access

28:47.868 --> 28:49.560
to women that a guy
in my position has,

28:49.595 --> 28:53.168
and what those women will do
to live my kind of lifestyle?

28:53.203 --> 28:55.170
- No, I, uh, I don't.

28:55.205 --> 28:57.040
- Yeah, it's ladies'
night at Ellis Island

28:57.075 --> 28:58.239
and I'm beatin' 'em
off with a stick.

28:58.274 --> 29:00.142
- You have an island?

29:00.177 --> 29:01.209
Oh.

29:01.244 --> 29:03.046
That's nice, discreet.

29:03.081 --> 29:05.444
Then what do you guys do
when you're on that island?

29:05.479 --> 29:07.985
- I don't know, use
your imagination.

29:08.020 --> 29:09.580
- Okay, like Ellis
Island, Ellis Island?

29:09.615 --> 29:12.154
Or is this a club that
we're making an analogy to?

29:12.189 --> 29:14.321
Or how, so I know
exactly what you mean.

29:14.356 --> 29:16.224
- I'm Ellis, there's an island.

29:16.259 --> 29:17.929
Ellis Island, ladies
getting on it.

29:17.964 --> 29:19.227
- Women there, right.
- That's right.

29:19.262 --> 29:20.558
- That's right, okay.
- Boom.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.461
- The, oh, okay.

29:22.496 --> 29:24.232
So, Ellis Island is like,
it's like a joke on your name.

29:24.267 --> 29:25.596
Like, you are Ellis and you are

29:25.631 --> 29:28.973
an island unto
yourself kinda thing?

29:29.008 --> 29:31.371
- Yes, if I had an island, it
would be called Ellis Island.

29:31.406 --> 29:32.977
- That already exists.

29:33.012 --> 29:34.539
You couldn't probably
name it that.

29:34.574 --> 29:36.244
- What do you mean
it already exists?
- Oo.

29:36.279 --> 29:38.312
- I didn't buy an island.

29:38.347 --> 29:39.247
- Okay.
- God.

29:40.921 --> 29:42.481
Are these seat
warmers not working?

29:51.228 --> 29:52.524
- Half a mile up the
highway in the middle

29:52.559 --> 29:54.229
of nowhere and you
still can't go?

29:54.264 --> 29:55.296
- You're not helping.

29:59.302 --> 30:01.269
So, you're an accountant, right?

30:01.304 --> 30:03.909
- Yeah.

30:03.944 --> 30:07.539
- Well, I have some money that
I've acquired over some time

30:07.574 --> 30:09.409
and I think it would
be good if I could-

30:09.444 --> 30:11.609
- Make it look like it came
from a legitimate source?

30:11.644 --> 30:14.513
- Yeah, seems like
you'd know how.

30:14.548 --> 30:16.988
- Got a little saved up
in your piggy bank there,

30:17.023 --> 30:19.287
mighty might, hm?

30:19.322 --> 30:21.157
- Mighty might?

30:21.192 --> 30:23.929
- Lookin' to start a new
Roth IRA, invest a few funds?

30:25.999 --> 30:28.230
How much we talkin' about here?

30:28.265 --> 30:31.002
- Like, 650.

30:31.037 --> 30:35.006
- Yeah, nobody cares where
you got $650 from, Nat.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.436
- 650 grand.

30:38.374 --> 30:39.373
- What?

30:41.146 --> 30:42.310
Are you serious?

30:44.083 --> 30:45.379
650...

30:45.414 --> 30:47.315
That's over half
a million dollars.

30:47.350 --> 30:49.251
- Wow, you really
are an accountant.

30:50.353 --> 30:51.352
- Oh, shit.

30:53.158 --> 30:54.993
No, nope, nope, sorry.

30:55.028 --> 30:57.325
I can't get involved
in anything like that.

30:57.360 --> 30:58.359
I'll lose my job.

30:58.394 --> 30:59.327
Lose my...

30:59.362 --> 31:00.460
I'd go to jail.

31:00.495 --> 31:01.626
I can't go to jail, okay?

31:01.661 --> 31:03.364
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

31:03.399 --> 31:07.071
- That's okay, I understand.

31:07.106 --> 31:08.402
- All right, you know,

31:08.437 --> 31:10.008
I can give you a
few tips, though.

31:10.043 --> 31:11.075
You know, I'll help
you out a little.

31:11.110 --> 31:12.637
But just a little.

31:12.672 --> 31:14.672
And if anybody asked,
I didn't help you.

31:18.183 --> 31:19.578
What's going on?

31:19.613 --> 31:21.349
You trying to start a
flash flood or what?

31:21.384 --> 31:22.680
- Chill out, I'm done.

31:22.715 --> 31:23.549
Oh!

31:23.584 --> 31:25.353
Ouch.

31:25.388 --> 31:26.486
- Oh, you know, for someone
who offers protection,

31:26.521 --> 31:27.619
you sure are a liability.

31:29.029 --> 31:29.962
You okay?

31:32.164 --> 31:34.065
You gotta go that way.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.429
Yeah, up the bank.

31:37.334 --> 31:40.071
- It's this way.
- You got it.

31:44.077 --> 31:45.505
Bad guys.

31:45.540 --> 31:46.737
Bad guys.

31:46.772 --> 31:48.376
Hurry, come on, get up the bank!

31:48.411 --> 31:49.608
Let's go.

32:08.728 --> 32:10.332
- Oh, shit.

32:10.367 --> 32:11.366
- There she is.

32:15.801 --> 32:17.405
- Come on, come on.

32:18.408 --> 32:19.308
- Oh!

32:31.190 --> 32:32.090
- Hold her.

32:37.559 --> 32:39.097
- How does this work?

32:48.504 --> 32:49.371
- Gotcha!

32:49.406 --> 32:50.339
Don't move.

32:51.474 --> 32:52.407
- Oh, shit!

32:52.442 --> 32:53.771
Damn it!

32:53.806 --> 32:55.047
- All right.

32:55.082 --> 32:55.773
Here's what's gonna...

32:57.579 --> 32:59.579
Oh, God.

32:59.614 --> 33:00.514
Oh!

33:02.584 --> 33:03.517
- God!

34:06.582 --> 34:07.515
- Let go!

34:07.550 --> 34:08.648
- Okay.

34:08.683 --> 34:09.682
- Whoa!

34:28.835 --> 34:30.703
- I'm gonna kill you, bitch.

34:30.738 --> 34:31.605
- You can try.

34:33.246 --> 34:34.443
- Damn it.

34:36.579 --> 34:37.875
- No.

35:28.631 --> 35:29.927
No!

35:34.571 --> 35:35.801
- Oh!

35:35.836 --> 35:36.934
You got him!

35:40.643 --> 35:41.741
- I killed you, bitch.

35:45.846 --> 35:47.252
You holding back
on the firepower

35:47.287 --> 35:47.978
there to make me sweat, Rudolph?

35:49.652 --> 35:51.223
- Where the hell did you
learn to fight like that?

35:51.258 --> 35:52.917
- I trained rigorously
under the tutelage

35:52.952 --> 35:55.722
of a samurai master when I was
traveling through East Asia.

35:55.757 --> 35:57.955
I can strangle a man to
death with my bare thighs.

35:59.662 --> 36:00.760
- That's a helluva way to go.

36:00.795 --> 36:03.631
- Mm.

36:03.666 --> 36:05.204
Go.
- Okay.

36:12.708 --> 36:13.740
- Hey, Tasha.

36:13.775 --> 36:14.873
- Hello, baby.

36:14.908 --> 36:16.281
- Take the shot, Ellis.

36:16.316 --> 36:17.546
I can't be the one that does it.

36:19.583 --> 36:21.220
Take the shot, Ellis!

36:25.688 --> 36:27.523
- I thought you loved me!

36:35.698 --> 36:36.730
- You idiot!

36:38.371 --> 36:40.635
What do you think this
is, a Hallmark movie?

36:44.674 --> 36:47.939
- Ow, jeez, my elbow.

36:47.974 --> 36:49.644
Ugh, and my hip.

36:49.679 --> 36:51.580
- Yeah, you got pretty
rowdy back there.

36:51.615 --> 36:53.714
- I didn't do anything.

36:55.355 --> 36:57.751
- So, uh, who were they?

36:57.786 --> 36:59.324
Seemed like they were way
more serious this time.

36:59.359 --> 37:00.622
- It was Ellis.

37:00.657 --> 37:02.690
Probably one of his cleaners.

37:02.725 --> 37:04.428
Not quite the boss but
as high up the food chain

37:04.463 --> 37:05.924
as you're gonna get.

37:05.959 --> 37:07.596
- Great.

37:07.631 --> 37:10.533
And, um, a relationship
seems to exist?

37:13.406 --> 37:14.702
- You could say that.

37:16.970 --> 37:18.706
I was engaged to Ellis.

37:18.741 --> 37:21.775
So, he probably feels a
little jilted right now.

37:21.810 --> 37:23.348
- I can't imagine why.

37:23.383 --> 37:25.383
- Look, it's what I do.

37:25.418 --> 37:28.815
I get close to criminals, I
screw 'em over and I move on.

37:28.850 --> 37:31.653
It's my own personal way
of dishing out karma.

37:31.688 --> 37:34.392
You know, in that regard, you
and I aren't so different.

37:38.431 --> 37:39.595
- So, were you gonna
go through with it

37:39.630 --> 37:40.629
and actually marry that guy?

37:43.469 --> 37:45.062
I'm sorry.

37:45.097 --> 37:47.372
It's none of my business.

37:47.407 --> 37:51.343
- Truth is, I don't know.

37:51.378 --> 37:52.938
I never know what kinda
trouble I'm gonna get into

37:52.973 --> 37:55.974
because I turn into
another person, remember?

37:56.009 --> 37:57.580
I mean, Tasha doesn't
just fix problems,

37:57.615 --> 37:59.417
she also creates them, too.

37:59.452 --> 38:01.749
Yet, she doesn't have to
deal with the consequences.

38:01.784 --> 38:03.487
I'm the one that gets to wake up

38:03.522 --> 38:05.555
with a tattoo of a
sword on my wrist,

38:05.590 --> 38:07.359
or an engagement
ring on my finger.

38:09.462 --> 38:10.956
- She does seem pretty
unfazed by everything.

38:10.991 --> 38:12.595
- Doesn't she just?
- Yeah.

38:12.630 --> 38:14.366
- Yeah, it's fun to be me.

38:19.131 --> 38:23.771
- Hey, you know, I think I
saw a medical kit in here.

38:23.806 --> 38:24.706
Here.

38:27.612 --> 38:28.776
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

38:28.811 --> 38:29.843
- It's very kind.

38:33.486 --> 38:37.114
And for the record, I have
no feelings for Ellis.

38:37.149 --> 38:40.788
- Oh, hey, it's, uh, it's
got nothing to do with me.

38:40.823 --> 38:42.790
- I know, I just want you

38:42.825 --> 38:45.958
to know the situation
logistically.

38:45.993 --> 38:47.432
- Logistically?

38:48.831 --> 38:51.403
- Yeah, logistically.

38:53.704 --> 38:55.066
- Logistically.

38:55.101 --> 38:56.606
Okay.

39:04.583 --> 39:06.814
- Please tell me
you found some keys.

39:06.849 --> 39:08.519
- No, she must've swiped 'em.

39:08.554 --> 39:09.817
We can't take the truck.

39:13.856 --> 39:15.889
- I can't believe you had
the shot and you bailed.

39:15.924 --> 39:17.693
- I didn't bail, all right?

39:17.728 --> 39:19.728
I was just checking to
see if she was running

39:19.763 --> 39:21.763
from the situation
or running from me.

39:21.798 --> 39:24.700
- Oh my God, can you
be any more pathetic?

39:24.735 --> 39:26.438
She's the worst.

39:26.473 --> 39:28.836
She's literally the worst
choice you can make.

39:28.871 --> 39:30.739
You're never gonna
know what she wants

39:30.774 --> 39:32.972
because that kinda girl, she
doesn't know what she wants.

39:33.007 --> 39:35.843
It's the mystery
combined with the hedonism,

39:35.878 --> 39:37.515
that's the allure.

39:37.550 --> 39:39.044
You need somebody more mature,

39:39.079 --> 39:41.552
like a woman that makes
you appear smarter

39:41.587 --> 39:43.180
and more confident
than you actually are,

39:43.215 --> 39:45.688
like a doctor or a chemist.

39:45.723 --> 39:47.756
- You know what?
You don't even know her.

39:47.791 --> 39:50.055
Besides, I'm not into
chicks who wear glasses.

39:52.257 --> 39:55.467
- Your entire future
hinges on this right now,

39:55.502 --> 39:57.095
and you are willing to let it
trickle through your fingers.

39:57.130 --> 39:59.229
Why?
Have you thought about that?

39:59.264 --> 40:01.165
Because you found
some tiny little human

40:01.200 --> 40:04.234
and you think she's cool because
she's playing hard to get?

40:04.269 --> 40:06.940
This is where you take
control of your mind.

40:06.975 --> 40:09.877
She is showing you
zero loyalty right now.

40:09.912 --> 40:12.011
Your loyalty is
with your family.

40:12.046 --> 40:13.782
- Oh, yeah?

40:13.817 --> 40:15.619
Do you know how hard it
is to get over somebody?

40:15.654 --> 40:18.248
You probably don't because
you're clearly unlovable.

40:18.283 --> 40:20.888
- Maybe I'm trying
to be unlovable

40:20.923 --> 40:23.528
because maybe this
right here attracts

40:23.563 --> 40:24.892
way too much attention,

40:24.927 --> 40:26.993
so I have to weed
out the weak offers.

40:27.028 --> 40:29.534
I just let the strong
swimmers through,
if you catch my drift.

40:29.569 --> 40:32.900
- Wow.
That's classy.

40:32.935 --> 40:35.705
Look, you don't need
to prove anything to me

40:35.740 --> 40:37.740
and I don't need to
prove anything to you.

40:37.775 --> 40:39.170
- But you know what
you do need to do?

40:39.205 --> 40:41.106
You need to prove
something to yourself.

40:42.549 --> 40:43.878
You need to prove that you

40:43.913 --> 40:46.144
can get over this
Natasha whatever,

40:46.179 --> 40:48.916
move on and do the right thing,

40:48.951 --> 40:51.116
which is shoot her in the head.

40:51.151 --> 40:53.756
- Have you seen what
she's capable of?

40:53.791 --> 40:55.252
Now imagine that in the bedroom.

40:55.287 --> 40:56.627
You try getting over it.

40:56.662 --> 40:58.123
- She just kicks a lot.

40:58.158 --> 41:00.158
Just get a little blowup
doll or something.

41:00.193 --> 41:01.830
They're much easier
to deal with.

41:01.865 --> 41:02.897
- Just change the tire.

41:02.932 --> 41:04.096
- I don't, I don't...

41:04.131 --> 41:05.295
I've stopped listening to you.

41:05.330 --> 41:07.066
- Lefty, Lucy.

41:07.101 --> 41:08.936
- I'm sorry, are you
talking to me like that?

41:08.971 --> 41:12.577
- Yes, just change
the tire already.

41:12.612 --> 41:13.578
Are you kidding me?
- I'm done.

41:13.613 --> 41:14.942
Get in the truck.

41:14.977 --> 41:15.877
I will shoot you
right in the balls.

41:15.912 --> 41:16.944
I don't care.

41:16.979 --> 41:18.913
- Okay, fix the tire.

41:18.948 --> 41:20.684
Righty tighty, okay?

41:24.888 --> 41:26.591
- I don't think
your dad will mind

41:26.626 --> 41:27.955
if I bring him home a
girl instead of a boy.

41:48.307 --> 41:50.340
- What was his name?

41:50.375 --> 41:53.145
I don't really like
referring to him as the box.

41:54.951 --> 41:56.588
- Uh, Bobby.

41:56.623 --> 41:57.985
Well, Robert, but you know,

41:58.020 --> 42:01.186
they used to call
us Bobby and Jimmy.

42:01.221 --> 42:03.287
We used to do a lotta
fun stuff together.

42:03.322 --> 42:05.630
- Yeah?

42:05.665 --> 42:08.028
Like what?

42:08.063 --> 42:10.701
- Well, we got our
pilots license together.

42:10.736 --> 42:13.297
We were actually thinking about
buying a plane at one point.

42:13.332 --> 42:15.266
- You can fly?

42:15.301 --> 42:16.839
Get out of here.

42:20.042 --> 42:21.613
- I should do that again.

42:23.342 --> 42:28.015
Guess it might bring
me closer to him.

42:35.288 --> 42:36.287
Jesus!

42:38.225 --> 42:40.192
What the heck?

42:47.707 --> 42:52.039
♪ Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

42:52.074 --> 42:55.141
♪ Try something new ♪

42:55.176 --> 42:59.112

43:03.085 --> 43:06.856

43:09.993 --> 43:11.795
- Life's precious,

43:11.830 --> 43:15.359
but playing it safe all
the time isn't living.

43:15.394 --> 43:18.230
When you try to hold on too
long, it just passes you by.

43:18.265 --> 43:20.771
You've gotta engage.

43:24.975 --> 43:26.744
- You telling me I should
take up archery or something?

43:26.779 --> 43:29.406
- No, I want
you to do something else.

43:31.047 --> 43:32.376
Strip down.

43:34.182 --> 43:36.347
- Is this a mugging?

43:36.382 --> 43:38.250
- No, silly.

43:38.285 --> 43:41.990
I want you to feel
the air on your skin.

43:42.025 --> 43:45.796
Now, come out of your cocoon
and take off your shirt.

43:49.868 --> 43:52.968
- All right.

43:55.500 --> 43:56.708
Okay?

43:56.743 --> 43:58.006
- Mm hm.

43:58.041 --> 43:59.040
- Happy?

43:59.075 --> 44:00.437
- Now the other one.

44:03.013 --> 44:04.177
- Look, I, uh-

44:04.212 --> 44:06.784
- Jimmy, you need to do this.

44:08.249 --> 44:09.347
You need to rediscover
that getting wild

44:09.382 --> 44:12.119
from time to time is fun.

44:12.154 --> 44:13.956
That is living.

44:13.991 --> 44:15.122
- I know, okay.

44:15.157 --> 44:16.959
I want to be fun.

44:16.994 --> 44:18.389
I want to let loose
to be wild at times.

44:18.424 --> 44:19.863
I just,

44:21.163 --> 44:22.294
I don't know.

44:22.329 --> 44:24.065
I just always play it safe.

44:24.100 --> 44:26.001
Maybe I'm scared.

44:26.036 --> 44:27.167
- Look, it's easy.

44:31.371 --> 44:32.777
Your turn.

44:35.012 --> 44:36.176
- Look, I...

44:44.186 --> 44:45.449
Oo.

44:45.484 --> 44:46.857
There we go.

44:46.892 --> 44:48.155
- How does that feel?

44:48.190 --> 44:49.420
- Oh, yeah, yeah, feeling good.

44:49.455 --> 44:50.828
Feeling good.
- All right.

44:50.863 --> 44:52.225
Let's try something.
- Good.

44:52.260 --> 44:54.964
- I want you to yell
as loud as you can,

44:54.999 --> 44:57.065
"I'm not gonna be
pushed around anymore."

44:58.530 --> 44:59.362
- Mm.

45:02.039 --> 45:04.842
I'm not gonna be
pushed around anymore.

45:04.877 --> 45:07.339
- That was pathetic.

45:07.374 --> 45:09.407
Louder. Come on.

45:09.442 --> 45:11.244
I'm not gonna get
pushed around anymore!

45:16.218 --> 45:20.121
- I'm not gonna get
pushed around anymore.

45:20.156 --> 45:21.452
- Oh, that was weak.

45:23.258 --> 45:25.863
- I'm not gonna get
pushed around anymore!

45:27.295 --> 45:29.031
- I'm not gonna smile

45:29.066 --> 45:30.934
just because people tell
me I need to look happy!

45:32.300 --> 45:34.168
- And I'm not gonna put

45:34.203 --> 45:36.566
my personal checking account
information under $10

45:36.601 --> 45:39.041
on my tax returns anymore!

45:41.177 --> 45:42.506
- And I'm not gonna deal

45:42.541 --> 45:44.442
with any more of
Tasha's hang overs.

45:44.477 --> 45:47.445
- Yeah, and I'm not stoppin'
for yellow lights anymore.

45:47.480 --> 45:48.380
That's it.

45:51.253 --> 45:53.451
You know what I'm not doin'?

45:53.486 --> 45:55.959
I'm not playin' fantasy
football anymore.

45:55.994 --> 45:58.093
I'm not goin' on
social media anymore.

45:58.128 --> 46:00.458
I'm not countin' my
daily steps anymore.

46:00.493 --> 46:03.230
I'm not gonna go to the gym
two times a day anymore.

46:03.265 --> 46:05.166
That's it!

46:05.201 --> 46:09.071
- And I'm not gonna deny that
I freaking love Nickelback.

46:09.106 --> 46:10.303
- That's a great band.

46:10.338 --> 46:11.304
- Yeah, it is.
- Great band.

46:11.339 --> 46:13.306
And you know what?

46:13.341 --> 46:17.244
I'm not gonna rotate my tires
every six months anymore.

46:17.279 --> 46:19.345
I'm not gonna care what
people think anymore.

46:21.547 --> 46:23.613
I'm not gonna live inside
a little bubble anymore.

46:23.648 --> 46:25.153
I'm takin' my pants off.

46:25.188 --> 46:26.319
This feels great.

46:28.356 --> 46:29.188
Do you see this?

46:31.293 --> 46:36.098
I'm not gonna take
life's shit anymore!

46:36.133 --> 46:38.364
And if anybody has
any problem with it,

46:38.399 --> 46:41.070
you can just kiss my ass!

46:42.304 --> 46:43.270
Woo!

46:44.669 --> 46:47.406
- Now,
that is engaging.

46:49.080 --> 46:50.310
- Yeah, I'm gonna pull
my pants back up now.

46:50.345 --> 46:52.609
- Okay.
- Yeah.

46:52.644 --> 46:54.578

49:23.597 --> 49:25.498

restless beaver.

49:27.073 --> 49:29.106

Now, I hate to be the
one to say I told you so

50:05.507 --> 50:08.541
but I hope this is all the
closure that you're gonna need.

50:16.782 --> 50:18.485

50:18.520 --> 50:20.421
I don't get it.

50:20.456 --> 50:22.489

me going through with this?

you're putting on me.

50:28.266 --> 50:29.166

bonus or something?

50:29.201 --> 50:30.299
What's the deal?

50:30.334 --> 50:31.531
- Listen to me right now.

50:31.566 --> 50:34.369
My father mentored your father.

50:34.404 --> 50:36.272
Your dad wasn't always
such a big shot, Ellis.

50:36.307 --> 50:37.801
He had a little bit of help.

50:37.836 --> 50:40.507
So, this is it just a
rite of passage for you.

50:40.542 --> 50:43.576
This is the rite of
passage for both of us.

50:48.451 --> 50:49.615

- Really.

50:53.258 --> 50:54.818
- Okay, well, it doesn't matter

50:54.853 --> 50:56.523
because I'm done with Natasha.

50:56.558 --> 50:58.129
- Oh.
- She had her chance

50:58.164 --> 50:58.855
and she blew it.

51:00.430 --> 51:02.661
We're gonna finish
this for good.

51:02.696 --> 51:04.597
Your dad's gonna
be proud of you.

51:04.632 --> 51:06.533
- Yeah, well, thank you
for this sentiment, really,

51:06.568 --> 51:07.600
but my dad is dead.

51:09.571 --> 51:11.538
I have a trick up my sleeve.

51:11.573 --> 51:13.474
It's gonna raise our game

51:13.509 --> 51:15.509
and then we're gonna catch up
to that cat piss, Evergreen.

51:19.482 --> 51:21.680
- I'm sorry I called
you unlovable.

51:21.715 --> 51:23.385
It was out of order.

51:26.258 --> 51:27.587
- Thank you so much
for that apology.

51:27.622 --> 51:30.227
It did hurt my
feelings a little bit.

51:30.262 --> 51:33.428
- You, uh, you wanna hug it out?

51:33.463 --> 51:34.792

Last time you were in control,

51:59.324 --> 52:00.488
you took us right
into the lion's den.

52:01.590 --> 52:03.227
- I know.

52:03.262 --> 52:04.492
I'm sorry.

52:07.695 --> 52:09.563

52:11.633 --> 52:13.237

52:13.272 --> 52:15.305

52:15.340 --> 52:18.902

52:18.937 --> 52:22.312
Feels like I rode a cinder
block down a staircase.

52:22.347 --> 52:23.940

52:57.613 --> 52:58.975

52:59.010 --> 53:01.714
- It's a client of mine.

53:01.749 --> 53:03.452
She caught her husband
cheating at the beach house

1:02:01.827 --> 1:02:03.024
- Good, good, I'm
glad you're safe.

1:02:03.059 --> 1:02:04.927
I was gettin' worried about you.

1:02:04.962 --> 1:02:08.227
So, you wanna tell me why
I did bodies everywhere

1:02:08.262 --> 1:02:09.965
and a trail of
destruction headin'

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:11.461
all the way to the God
damn Pacific coastline?

1:02:11.496 --> 1:02:13.199
- Yeah, I've been trying
to warn people, Dad.

1:02:13.234 --> 1:02:15.531
This girl is easy to
underestimate, all right?

1:02:15.566 --> 1:02:16.939
But they wouldn't listen to me.

1:02:16.974 --> 1:02:18.270
They wouldn't take me seriously.

1:02:18.305 --> 1:02:20.206
Plus, she's working
with this guy

1:02:20.241 --> 1:02:23.341
who's clearly some
kind of a badass.

1:02:23.376 --> 1:02:25.882
- Eli, I need you to take
that big stick that's up

1:02:25.917 --> 1:02:27.917
your rear end and put
it in drive, okay?

1:02:27.952 --> 1:02:29.314
I need you to get
your ass in gear

1:02:29.349 --> 1:02:31.283
and I need you to
get this job done.

1:02:31.318 --> 1:02:32.823
- I am getting it done, Dad!

1:02:32.858 --> 1:02:34.286
- I need you to
find that tough guy

1:02:34.321 --> 1:02:35.925
that's buried deep
down within yourself.

1:02:35.960 --> 1:02:37.355
- I am a tough guy!

1:02:37.390 --> 1:02:39.225
- Eli, Eli, Eli, I
need you to understand

1:02:39.260 --> 1:02:40.996
that I'm not gonna
be around forever.

1:02:41.031 --> 1:02:42.833
I need to know that my
precious little boy is safe.

1:02:42.868 --> 1:02:46.562
For that, he must become
a man on his own terms.

1:02:46.597 --> 1:02:48.839
- This is your badass.

1:02:56.277 --> 1:02:57.848
- Yeah, I know, Dad.

1:02:57.883 --> 1:02:59.080
I appreciate it.

1:02:59.115 --> 1:03:01.610
Look, I have this under control.

1:03:01.645 --> 1:03:03.315
Pretty sure I know where she is.

1:03:03.350 --> 1:03:05.020
- That's great to hear.

1:03:05.055 --> 1:03:06.483
Now, I'm gonna send
you some more resources

1:03:06.518 --> 1:03:08.287
to help ensure you got
everything you need.

1:03:08.322 --> 1:03:10.256
If you can finish this
without getting pretty much

1:03:10.291 --> 1:03:12.093
every member of our syndicate
killed in the process,

1:03:12.128 --> 1:03:13.457
and leading every authority

1:03:13.492 --> 1:03:14.997
in California right
to our doorstep,

1:03:15.032 --> 1:03:17.098
that would be doin'
me a huge favor.

1:03:17.133 --> 1:03:19.265
- I will have it
done tomorrow, Dad.

1:03:19.300 --> 1:03:20.871
You have my word.

1:03:20.906 --> 1:03:22.367
- I'm confident it will be.

1:03:22.402 --> 1:03:23.973
Good chat, Son.

1:03:24.008 --> 1:03:25.942
Take care and be safe.

1:03:25.977 --> 1:03:27.273
And your mother sends her love.

1:03:53.334 --> 1:03:54.234
- Hey.

1:03:56.337 --> 1:03:58.304
I made some tea.

1:03:58.339 --> 1:03:59.305
We should get moving soon.

1:03:59.340 --> 1:04:00.273
- Yeah.

1:04:00.308 --> 1:04:01.373
Wow, thank you.

1:04:06.248 --> 1:04:09.051
- Look, I'm sorry I
got upset last night.

1:04:10.153 --> 1:04:11.515
It's not you.

1:04:11.550 --> 1:04:13.682
It's her.

1:04:13.717 --> 1:04:17.026
You just, you need to
understand what Tasha really is.

1:04:19.426 --> 1:04:22.361
- And what is she exactly?

1:04:22.396 --> 1:04:26.497
- Well, for starters,
she's a superficial bitch.

1:04:26.532 --> 1:04:29.335
All she has to offer is shooting
and hitting things because,

1:04:29.370 --> 1:04:33.537
no offense, that's what
guys think strength is.

1:04:33.572 --> 1:04:35.341
And you know, she's not even
into all the badass things

1:04:35.376 --> 1:04:38.146
that guys typically like
because she likes them.

1:04:38.181 --> 1:04:39.576
No, it's because guys like them

1:04:39.611 --> 1:04:42.150
and she desperately
wants to be adored.

1:04:42.185 --> 1:04:44.185
She's a Barbie doll with
a G.I. Joe attitude,

1:04:44.220 --> 1:04:45.549
and a total liar.

1:04:45.584 --> 1:04:47.386
I mean, don't even
get me started

1:04:47.421 --> 1:04:49.025
on all of her
embellished back stories.

1:04:49.060 --> 1:04:50.653
- Wait, you were never raised

1:04:50.688 --> 1:04:53.689
by a small-town sheriff in Utah?

1:04:53.724 --> 1:04:56.494
- We had a temporary foster
parent who was a security guard.

1:04:58.234 --> 1:04:59.596
- And the Army course?

1:04:59.631 --> 1:05:01.334
- Basic reserve training.

1:05:01.369 --> 1:05:03.435
And a summer job in Jiffy Lube.

1:05:03.470 --> 1:05:05.206
And no, we didn't help protect

1:05:05.241 --> 1:05:07.142
Native American
reservations either.

1:05:07.177 --> 1:05:08.572
We rode horses for a summer

1:05:08.607 --> 1:05:10.541
and went through a
major hippie phase.

1:05:10.576 --> 1:05:12.246
- So, you never
traveled through Asia

1:05:12.281 --> 1:05:15.315
and studied with the
legendary samurai warrior?

1:05:15.350 --> 1:05:18.186
- Oh, no, that's 100% true.

1:05:18.221 --> 1:05:20.254
We can rip a man's heart out
of his chest still beating.

1:05:21.422 --> 1:05:23.389
- Oh, that's good to know.

1:05:23.424 --> 1:05:26.458
- I get why you guys fall for
her sexy femme fatale act.

1:05:27.593 --> 1:05:29.527
- Yeah, look, Natasha said-

1:05:29.562 --> 1:05:32.068
- You're an average guy and
you want to live a normal life,

1:05:32.103 --> 1:05:34.334
so, what is she to you?

1:05:36.437 --> 1:05:39.471
- She's chaos.

1:05:41.475 --> 1:05:44.113
- She's what you think you want.

1:05:45.611 --> 1:05:47.611
And I don't blame people
for being tempted,

1:05:47.646 --> 1:05:51.153
but please don't fall for it
without knowing what it is.

1:05:52.717 --> 1:05:55.487
Tasha's a part of me,
Jimmy, and she's dangerous.

1:05:56.655 --> 1:05:58.226
That makes me dangerous, too.

1:06:00.593 --> 1:06:02.560
- Yeah, I think you got it all-

1:06:06.731 --> 1:06:07.664
- What was that?

1:06:07.699 --> 1:06:09.072
- I don't know.

1:06:10.636 --> 1:06:13.010
The truck, it's gone!

1:06:17.478 --> 1:06:19.511
No, no !

1:06:27.125 --> 1:06:28.685
- Where's Bobby's ashes?

1:06:28.720 --> 1:06:30.126
- I left them in the truck.

1:06:30.161 --> 1:06:34.163
- What are we gonna do?

1:06:42.866 --> 1:06:44.569
- Are you thinkin'
what I'm thinkin'?

1:06:46.309 --> 1:06:48.540
- I fixed that truck, now
I'm gonna get it back.

1:06:49.741 --> 1:06:51.543
Let's do this.

1:07:29.517 --> 1:07:30.747
- Oh, yeah.

1:07:30.782 --> 1:07:32.287
Okay.

1:07:32.322 --> 1:07:33.288
Oh.

1:07:33.323 --> 1:07:35.125
Oh, no, no keys.

1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:36.159
There's no keys.

1:07:39.296 --> 1:07:41.593
Unbelievable.

1:07:43.465 --> 1:07:44.662
Here we go.

1:07:44.697 --> 1:07:46.202
Preflight inspection completed.

1:07:46.237 --> 1:07:47.269
Seats adjusted, secured.

1:07:47.304 --> 1:07:48.336
Seat belts fastened.

1:07:48.371 --> 1:07:49.469
Cabin door closed.

1:07:49.504 --> 1:07:50.767
- What are you doing?

1:07:50.802 --> 1:07:52.571
- I can't remember
unless I do it in order.

1:07:52.606 --> 1:07:53.869
- Okay, well, if you could
remember a little faster,

1:07:53.904 --> 1:07:55.640
that would be great.

1:07:55.675 --> 1:07:57.444
- Listen, I gotta reach
out to traffic control.

1:07:57.479 --> 1:07:59.545
It's for our own safety.

1:07:59.580 --> 1:08:00.909
Big Bear 2-4-

1:08:00.944 --> 1:08:02.284
- This is why the other reindeer

1:08:02.319 --> 1:08:03.516
won't fly with you, Rudolph.

1:08:04.783 --> 1:08:06.255
Go.

1:08:26.442 --> 1:08:27.408
- We're doin' this.

1:08:27.443 --> 1:08:28.574
- Woo!

1:08:28.609 --> 1:08:29.872
- We are doin' this.

1:08:33.548 --> 1:08:35.185
Welcome to Escape Airlines.

1:08:35.220 --> 1:08:36.219
I'm your pilot, Jimmy.

1:08:37.585 --> 1:08:39.717
We've got clear
skies all the way.

1:09:01.576 --> 1:09:03.378
This is pointless.

1:09:03.413 --> 1:09:04.676
We're never gonna find it.

1:09:08.880 --> 1:09:10.946
- Oh, ye of little faith.

1:09:10.981 --> 1:09:13.289
There she is.

1:09:13.324 --> 1:09:15.984
Right, I see a weak point.

1:09:16.019 --> 1:09:18.294
- Shouldn't we be
coming up with a plan?

1:09:18.329 --> 1:09:20.725
- That's what
they'll be expecting.

1:09:20.760 --> 1:09:23.464
- So, just more chaos then?

1:09:23.499 --> 1:09:26.632
- Oh, you
know me too well.

1:09:28.768 --> 1:09:29.701
- Yeah.

1:09:42.584 --> 1:09:44.947
- Hey, Dave,
you comin' over for lunch?

1:09:44.982 --> 1:09:48.588
- Hey, that's what
I've been waitin' for.

1:09:54.530 --> 1:09:55.859
- Nice to see you, sweetheart.

1:10:05.640 --> 1:10:06.672
- Is he dead?

1:10:27.728 --> 1:10:28.991
Yeah, good shot.

1:10:35.098 --> 1:10:36.471
God!

1:10:36.506 --> 1:10:37.406
Sorry.

1:10:41.874 --> 1:10:43.709
- Ya done?
- Yeah. My shoe lace.

1:10:43.744 --> 1:10:44.908
I'm sorry, I nearly tripped.

1:10:54.656 --> 1:10:56.425
I think they know we're here.

1:10:56.460 --> 1:10:57.723
- Good.

1:12:14.934 --> 1:12:15.834
- Tasha!

1:12:32.952 --> 1:12:34.424
Oh!

1:12:34.459 --> 1:12:35.887
- What the hell are you doing?

1:12:35.922 --> 1:12:38.824
- Is aggression the
only solution for you?

1:12:38.859 --> 1:12:40.925
- Yeah.
- You know we hooked up, right?

1:12:40.960 --> 1:12:42.498
- Rudolph, I wouldn't
hook up with you

1:12:42.533 --> 1:12:43.961
if you were the last
man on the planet.

1:12:46.504 --> 1:12:47.470
Unless...

1:12:49.199 --> 1:12:50.836
Did she...

1:12:50.871 --> 1:12:52.739
Damn, Nat.

1:12:52.774 --> 1:12:53.872
Get in the car.
- All right.

1:12:58.549 --> 1:13:00.208
- Where are the keys?

1:13:14.191 --> 1:13:15.190
- Nat?

1:13:15.225 --> 1:13:16.565
Nat?

1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:17.599
Hey?

1:13:17.634 --> 1:13:19.128
Hey, look at me.

1:13:19.163 --> 1:13:20.470
You okay?

1:13:21.770 --> 1:13:22.868
- What happened?

1:13:25.873 --> 1:13:27.004
- They got us.

1:13:34.783 --> 1:13:36.552
- In stilettos.

1:13:36.587 --> 1:13:38.114
- What do ya think they're
talkin' about out there?

1:13:38.149 --> 1:13:41.887
- They're gathering
witnesses for an execution.

1:13:41.922 --> 1:13:44.791
- Oh .

1:13:46.696 --> 1:13:49.059
Look, I don't want to
state the obvious here,

1:13:49.094 --> 1:13:50.797
but now would be a
really great time

1:13:50.832 --> 1:13:52.260
if you could do the
whole Wonder Woman thing.

1:13:52.295 --> 1:13:54.262
- Look, Jimmy, it's
not like I can just go

1:13:54.297 --> 1:13:55.901
into a phone booth
and change, okay?

1:13:55.936 --> 1:13:56.968
- Okay .

1:14:07.948 --> 1:14:12.280
- Look, there's something
I haven't told you.

1:14:12.315 --> 1:14:15.591
It's about how Tasha came to be.

1:14:17.056 --> 1:14:18.253
I was an orphan.

1:14:19.861 --> 1:14:24.831
But in the beginning,
it wasn't just me.

1:14:27.638 --> 1:14:28.802
I had a twin sister.

1:14:30.839 --> 1:14:33.543
And we got passed around a lot.

1:14:34.975 --> 1:14:36.139
We were all each other had.

1:14:37.681 --> 1:14:40.583
And then one day,
she was just gone.

1:14:42.279 --> 1:14:43.586
They took her from me.

1:14:45.953 --> 1:14:47.755
You know, it's really hard

1:14:47.790 --> 1:14:50.956
going through something
like that by yourself.

1:14:50.991 --> 1:14:52.628
You know, I needed someone.

1:14:54.060 --> 1:14:58.029
So, I created an
imaginary friend, Tasha.

1:15:03.003 --> 1:15:06.774
The kids would tease me
about not having parents.

1:15:06.809 --> 1:15:08.908
Tasha told me everything
was gonna be okay.

1:15:11.044 --> 1:15:13.077
She was always in
my corner, you know?

1:15:14.949 --> 1:15:18.082
And as I got older and the
world got more dangerous,

1:15:19.250 --> 1:15:21.019
Tasha helped me survive.

1:15:24.024 --> 1:15:27.058
She always did the things
that I was too afraid to do.

1:15:30.833 --> 1:15:33.900
But with you, I have
been more myself

1:15:33.935 --> 1:15:38.069
these past few days than I have
been in a really long time.

1:15:39.974 --> 1:15:43.008
You don't make me feel like
I have to act a certain way,

1:15:43.043 --> 1:15:45.340
or that I have to
choose one side

1:15:45.375 --> 1:15:47.078
of my personality
over the other.

1:15:50.886 --> 1:15:56.021
You just make me feel
wanted as a whole.

1:15:56.056 --> 1:15:58.089
- That's what I've been
tryin' to tell you, Nat.

1:15:58.124 --> 1:16:01.796
I know you got two
personalities, but
your one person to me.

1:16:03.228 --> 1:16:06.768
And when I told you
that I fell for you,

1:16:06.803 --> 1:16:09.034
I fell for all of you, okay?

1:16:11.005 --> 1:16:13.269
Look at, there's no you
and her to me, okay?

1:16:13.304 --> 1:16:15.040
There's just you.

1:16:15.075 --> 1:16:16.712
I love you, Nat, okay?

1:16:16.747 --> 1:16:18.109
Don't you ever doubt that.

1:16:18.144 --> 1:16:20.078
- Execution time.

1:16:20.113 --> 1:16:23.246
Oh, I do love the setting,
dark, moody, ominous,

1:16:23.281 --> 1:16:26.051
this lingering atmosphere
of complete dread.

1:16:26.086 --> 1:16:27.723
Mwah! Perfection.

1:16:31.960 --> 1:16:33.157
- You know what?

1:16:33.192 --> 1:16:34.928
I couldn't figure out why it was

1:16:34.963 --> 1:16:36.094
that you went back for
that piece of crap truck,

1:16:36.129 --> 1:16:39.262
so I took a peek inside.

1:16:39.297 --> 1:16:40.967
So sorry for your loss.

1:16:42.168 --> 1:16:46.170
- Oh, I would also like to add

1:16:46.205 --> 1:16:51.714
that I am so happy that this
nightmare is almost over.

1:16:51.749 --> 1:16:53.947
But if anything, the
length that we went through

1:16:53.982 --> 1:16:56.719
to catch this problem
child only added

1:16:56.754 --> 1:16:59.084
to the greatness of
the rite of passage

1:16:59.119 --> 1:17:01.922
for our future
heir to the throne.

1:17:05.059 --> 1:17:08.324
- I have a special request.

1:17:08.359 --> 1:17:10.766
I want all of you to
put down your weapons.

1:17:10.801 --> 1:17:14.099
I want there to be no doubt
that I did this on my own terms.

1:17:14.134 --> 1:17:16.002
I don't want anybody thinking

1:17:16.037 --> 1:17:20.875
that Ellis Lombardo needs
anybody to do his dirty work.

1:17:20.910 --> 1:17:21.909
- Oo, it's a nice touch.

1:17:21.944 --> 1:17:22.943
You heard him, boys.

1:17:22.978 --> 1:17:24.747
Guns on the ground.

1:17:41.359 --> 1:17:42.798
- Hey?

1:17:42.833 --> 1:17:43.766
No.

1:17:43.801 --> 1:17:44.965
No!

1:17:50.808 --> 1:17:53.402
- Okay, final chance.

1:17:53.437 --> 1:17:55.206
You say you're sorry,

1:17:55.241 --> 1:17:57.780
we pretend this never
happened and you come with me.

1:17:57.815 --> 1:17:59.210
- Ellis?

1:17:59.245 --> 1:18:00.816
- I'm not going with you.

1:18:00.851 --> 1:18:01.817
- There you go, she
doesn't love you.

1:18:01.852 --> 1:18:03.280
Shoot her.

1:18:03.315 --> 1:18:04.380
- I'm just checking
my options, all right?

1:18:10.520 --> 1:18:16.095
All right, what if
it's between him dying

1:18:16.130 --> 1:18:18.460
and you comin' with me?

1:18:18.495 --> 1:18:19.967
- Don't do it, Nat.

1:18:20.002 --> 1:18:21.133
Don't you do it.

1:18:21.168 --> 1:18:22.101
- Okay, okay.

1:18:22.136 --> 1:18:23.432
I'll go with you.

1:18:23.467 --> 1:18:24.939
If you let him go,
I'll go with you.

1:18:24.974 --> 1:18:26.039
It's a deal.

1:18:26.074 --> 1:18:27.172
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:18:27.207 --> 1:18:28.173
There is no deal.

1:18:28.208 --> 1:18:29.339
There is no deal.

1:18:29.374 --> 1:18:30.439
We have an agreement.

1:18:30.474 --> 1:18:32.111
She's obviously lying to you.

1:18:32.146 --> 1:18:34.344
Raise the gun and shoot her!

1:18:34.379 --> 1:18:36.247
- Why don't you get off my back?

1:18:36.282 --> 1:18:38.953
I don't answer to you, I
don't answer to my father,

1:18:38.988 --> 1:18:40.218
I don't answer to anybody.

1:18:40.253 --> 1:18:42.220
What is your problem?

1:18:42.255 --> 1:18:44.024
- I'm just trying
to be a good mentor.

1:18:44.059 --> 1:18:45.487
- Well, you suck.

1:18:51.231 --> 1:18:52.901
- You know what?

1:18:52.936 --> 1:18:54.100
Screw you and your legacy.

1:18:54.135 --> 1:18:55.497
I'm gonna do this myself.

1:18:55.532 --> 1:18:56.806
- Oh, no you don't.

1:18:56.841 --> 1:18:58.137
- You're not gonna use that.

1:18:58.172 --> 1:18:59.237
- Keep your hands
off your weapons

1:18:59.272 --> 1:19:01.008
or she gets it between the eyes.

1:19:01.043 --> 1:19:03.241
- This is what you awakened
inside of yourself?

1:19:03.276 --> 1:19:05.210
A sniveling traitor?

1:19:05.245 --> 1:19:07.982
Oh my God, Ellis, it's tragic.

1:19:08.017 --> 1:19:10.853
- Maybe it's my rite of passage.

1:19:10.888 --> 1:19:13.581
- I'm so sick of you.

1:19:32.140 --> 1:19:34.041
- Taking this as an
insurance policy.

1:19:40.984 --> 1:19:41.983
Get over here.

1:19:45.582 --> 1:19:46.548
Get stuffed.

1:19:54.294 --> 1:19:55.491
Take this.

1:19:55.526 --> 1:19:57.262
Get over here.

1:19:57.297 --> 1:19:58.329
Don't try anything.
- Jesus.

1:19:58.364 --> 1:20:00.133
- Stop it.
- Okay.

1:20:00.168 --> 1:20:01.365
- Get in the car.

1:20:02.434 --> 1:20:03.972
Get in.

1:20:04.007 --> 1:20:04.940
- Ow.

1:20:32.431 --> 1:20:33.364
- Hey.

1:20:34.972 --> 1:20:36.433
You, uh, you okay?

1:20:36.468 --> 1:20:39.568
- Do I look okay?

1:20:42.342 --> 1:20:44.078
Oh, he shot me .

1:20:48.579 --> 1:20:53.549
- Hey, look, I think we can
work together here, okay?

1:20:53.584 --> 1:20:56.321
You know, my enemy's the
enemy kinda thing, right?

1:20:56.356 --> 1:20:58.191
What do ya say?

1:20:58.226 --> 1:21:01.128
- Am I the only one that
stays in my frickin' lane?

1:21:01.163 --> 1:21:03.163
- Yeah, see, I know
where they're goin'.

1:21:04.969 --> 1:21:06.496
- Oh, yeah?
- I do.

1:21:06.531 --> 1:21:07.497
- Where would that be?

1:21:07.532 --> 1:21:08.366
- Vegas, baby.

1:21:08.401 --> 1:21:10.005
- Oh, Vegas?

1:21:10.040 --> 1:21:11.941
Wow, that is, of course...

1:21:11.976 --> 1:21:13.470
Vegas.

1:21:13.505 --> 1:21:14.372
- They're
gonna hitch that wagon.

1:21:14.407 --> 1:21:15.945
He loves her.

1:21:15.980 --> 1:21:19.344
- Oh, love.

1:21:19.379 --> 1:21:20.675
- Yeah.

1:21:28.388 --> 1:21:29.420
Holy shit.

1:21:30.489 --> 1:21:33.358
It worked.

1:21:33.393 --> 1:21:36.625
It worked .

1:22:18.306 --> 1:22:19.470
- You didn't let him go.

1:22:19.505 --> 1:22:20.372
That was the deal.

1:22:20.407 --> 1:22:21.571
- Shut up!

1:22:21.606 --> 1:22:23.210
Tasha will be fine with this.

1:22:23.245 --> 1:22:24.739
You're the one that's
messing things up.

1:22:24.774 --> 1:22:26.477
Tasha wants to be with me.

1:22:26.512 --> 1:22:28.413
- You were always just
her play toy, Ellis.

1:22:28.448 --> 1:22:29.645
- I said shut up!

1:22:47.533 --> 1:22:48.433
- Ha!

1:23:06.486 --> 1:23:08.156
- Get outta the car!

1:23:09.258 --> 1:23:10.290
Get the box.

1:23:13.493 --> 1:23:14.327
- What are we doin' here?

1:23:14.362 --> 1:23:15.295
- Shut up!

1:23:15.330 --> 1:23:16.296
- Ellis?

1:23:16.331 --> 1:23:17.363
- Hey!
- Shut up!

1:23:17.398 --> 1:23:18.826
- Take your hands off her, man.

1:23:18.861 --> 1:23:20.300
Hey, look, let's just
talk about this, okay?

1:23:20.335 --> 1:23:21.631
- You're not havin' her, bro.

1:23:21.666 --> 1:23:22.797
- Come on, man,
what are you doin'?

1:23:22.832 --> 1:23:24.205
Come on!
- Shut up!

1:23:24.240 --> 1:23:25.503
What's goin' on?

1:23:25.538 --> 1:23:27.472
Where's Tasha?
- I don't know.

1:23:27.507 --> 1:23:31.080
She hasn't been around as much
anymore, now that he's here.

1:23:31.115 --> 1:23:32.279
- You killed off Tasha?

1:23:32.314 --> 1:23:34.182
- What are you talkin' about?

1:23:34.217 --> 1:23:37.284
- Right, but she's gone,
you're worth nothin' to me.

1:23:37.319 --> 1:23:38.450
Get down there.

1:23:38.485 --> 1:23:39.748
- Hey!
- Get back!

1:23:39.783 --> 1:23:41.387
- Okay, all right.
- Just shut up.

1:23:41.422 --> 1:23:42.586
Gimme the box.
- No.

1:23:42.621 --> 1:23:43.785
- Gimme the box!
- No.

1:23:43.820 --> 1:23:44.753
- Come on, man.
- Gimme it!

1:23:44.788 --> 1:23:45.721
- No.
- Gimme the box!

1:23:45.756 --> 1:23:46.590
- No.
- Give it to me.

1:23:46.625 --> 1:23:47.459
- No, don't!

1:23:47.494 --> 1:23:48.856
Stop it!

1:23:48.891 --> 1:23:49.791
Put the box down.
- I'm sorry about it.

1:23:49.826 --> 1:23:50.726
- Put the box down.

1:23:50.761 --> 1:23:52.200
- It's your choice.

1:23:52.235 --> 1:23:55.071
Her, or your brother.

1:23:56.338 --> 1:23:57.370
- Come on, man.

1:24:04.379 --> 1:24:09.712
- Looks like
you made your choice.

1:24:09.747 --> 1:24:10.812
- No!

1:24:10.847 --> 1:24:11.879
- No, don't.

1:24:11.914 --> 1:24:13.221
- No!

1:24:13.256 --> 1:24:14.585
- Get back!

1:24:14.620 --> 1:24:16.323
- I swear to God, I
swear to God, man.

1:24:16.358 --> 1:24:17.885
- Ellis, please, don't-

1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:20.855
- I cannot believe you
chose that loser over me.

1:24:20.890 --> 1:24:22.692
On your knees!

1:24:22.727 --> 1:24:24.529
- Look at me.
- Shut up!

1:24:24.564 --> 1:24:26.531
Get down.
- All right, fine, fine.

1:24:26.566 --> 1:24:29.435
Look, I'm down on
my knees, all right?

1:24:31.538 --> 1:24:33.142
- This what you want?

1:24:33.177 --> 1:24:36.805
Sucks to be you, bro.

1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:38.345
- Come on, man.

1:24:38.380 --> 1:24:39.907
Don't do that.
Don't-

1:24:39.942 --> 1:24:42.151
Just, come on, man.

1:24:42.186 --> 1:24:43.416
Come on!

1:24:43.451 --> 1:24:44.813
- You're a dick, Ellis.

1:24:49.589 --> 1:24:51.490
Oh!

1:24:51.525 --> 1:24:52.887
Oh my God.

1:24:52.922 --> 1:24:54.196
How does she do that?

1:24:54.231 --> 1:24:55.329
- I don't know.

1:24:55.364 --> 1:24:56.561
- I think I broke my hand.

1:24:56.596 --> 1:24:57.892
Oh my God, it really...

1:25:01.469 --> 1:25:03.139
I'm sorry.

1:25:05.539 --> 1:25:06.934
- It's okay.

1:25:11.710 --> 1:25:13.578
- What now?

1:25:19.883 --> 1:25:21.718
- We're gonna finish
this, you and me.

1:25:23.590 --> 1:25:24.655
That's what we're doin'.

1:25:25.856 --> 1:25:27.592
I'm gonna get you to that boat.

1:25:31.697 --> 1:25:33.334
I'm sorry, brother .

1:25:35.635 --> 1:25:37.173
I tried, man.

1:25:39.540 --> 1:25:40.572
I tried.

1:25:42.345 --> 1:25:43.311
Let's go.

1:27:11.500 --> 1:27:13.731
- I can see why Bobby
picked this place.

1:27:14.734 --> 1:27:16.602
It's beautiful.

1:27:16.637 --> 1:27:19.572
- Yeah, we used to come down
here all the time his kids.

1:27:19.607 --> 1:27:21.838
See those rocks over there?

1:27:21.873 --> 1:27:23.576
The wind comes blowin' through,

1:27:23.611 --> 1:27:25.875
so we would run full
speed side-by-side,

1:27:25.910 --> 1:27:28.713
arms back, towel outstretched,

1:27:28.748 --> 1:27:31.551
seeing if we could catch
just enough lift to take off.

1:27:33.390 --> 1:27:36.853
So, where is the universe
gonna take you this time?

1:27:36.888 --> 1:27:38.723
- The same place
it always takes me.

1:27:38.758 --> 1:27:41.495
The Molokai Islands in Hawaii.

1:27:41.530 --> 1:27:43.563
Locals refer to it
as the Twin Islands.

1:27:47.668 --> 1:27:50.735
- So, was Ellis right,
what he said back there?

1:27:50.770 --> 1:27:52.033
You finally killed off Tasha?

1:27:54.103 --> 1:27:57.544
- Honestly, I don't know.

1:27:57.579 --> 1:27:58.743
I have a feeling she's
only going to show up

1:27:58.778 --> 1:28:00.041
if I really need her.

1:28:01.913 --> 1:28:05.816
When she does, that girl is
gonna be wilder than ever.

1:28:12.825 --> 1:28:15.925
- I'm gonna clean
that money for you.

1:28:15.960 --> 1:28:18.059
You don't have to worry
where it came from.

1:28:18.094 --> 1:28:19.698
- Thanks.

1:28:22.802 --> 1:28:24.967
You know, I'm startin' to think

1:28:25.002 --> 1:28:26.639
that two and half thousand miles

1:28:26.674 --> 1:28:28.608
is a long way to be
on a boat by yourself.

1:28:29.842 --> 1:28:31.611
- Yeah?

1:28:31.646 --> 1:28:33.514
Thinkin' about puttin'
down some roots?

1:28:35.551 --> 1:28:37.749
- Are you ready for a
helluva lotta baggage?

1:28:39.115 --> 1:28:40.653
- Yeah.

1:28:40.688 --> 1:28:42.424
I can handle it.

1:28:42.459 --> 1:28:44.492
- Can you?
- Yeah.

1:29:02.611 --> 1:29:04.809
- You did your
brother justice, Jimmy.

1:29:04.844 --> 1:29:06.679
He's in the water now.

1:29:06.714 --> 1:29:09.814
And eventually, he'll
visit every beach there is.

1:29:09.849 --> 1:29:11.552
- You know what?

1:29:11.587 --> 1:29:12.883
I love the way you think.

1:29:46.985 --> 1:29:49.854
- Over two dozen men,

1:29:49.889 --> 1:29:52.120
multiple vehicles,
countless weapons,

1:29:52.155 --> 1:29:54.958
my top fixer, all lost.

1:29:57.567 --> 1:29:59.160
Give me one good reason

1:29:59.195 --> 1:30:00.931
why you should ever inherit
a single thing from me.

1:30:02.968 --> 1:30:04.539
- Because I found that person

1:30:04.574 --> 1:30:06.068
you wanted me to
find inside myself.

1:30:07.038 --> 1:30:08.873
And I wanna get back out there

1:30:08.908 --> 1:30:13.174
and finish this
once and for all.
