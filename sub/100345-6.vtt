01:00.300 --> 01:03.140
They're all distortions of love.

01:03.660 --> 01:07.060
Hysteria of one sort or another.

01:12.340 --> 01:15.180
That's how
the Holy Father defined them.

01:21.540 --> 01:22.780
Do we know each other ?

01:27.860 --> 01:28.980
You are...

01:32.060 --> 01:33.100
Sofia Dubois,

01:37.540 --> 01:40.060
Tomas Altbruck's wife.
Everybody knows you.

01:42.340 --> 01:43.460
And I am...

01:45.140 --> 01:46.420
Leopold Essence.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.420
Whom no one knows.

01:52.740 --> 01:54.420
What were you saying just now ?

02:00.140 --> 02:02.860
Follow the love, I was saying.

02:06.460 --> 02:09.580
That's where you will find failure.

02:18.380 --> 02:21.140
Excuse me, but who are you ?

02:25.060 --> 02:29.100
I am the second most intelligent man
in the world.

02:32.380 --> 02:33.980
While we are on that subject,

02:36.500 --> 02:38.180
is it possible to call...

02:40.340 --> 02:41.740
Tomas Altbruck...

02:43.140 --> 02:44.340
a "man" ?

02:49.340 --> 02:53.140
Follow the love, Sofia.

04:46.780 --> 04:49.740
THE NEW POPE
Episode 6

05:30.460 --> 05:35.140
Whom did you prefer ?
Pius XIII or Francis II ?

05:38.420 --> 05:43.700
- I knew Pius XIII better.
- So Pius XIII, then. Why ?

05:46.740 --> 05:49.660
- Because he believed in me.
- I believe in you, too.

05:51.020 --> 05:53.580
But will you believe in me ?

06:10.580 --> 06:14.340
I'll give what's owed to you
to Fabiano.

06:14.980 --> 06:17.380
No. You will give it to me.

06:19.140 --> 06:22.940
Fabiano no longer exists.
For me or for you.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.820
And I will decide the amount.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.580
15 000 a visit.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.300
As it should be.

06:39.020 --> 06:42.780
Before you arrived,
Attanasio would scream all night.

06:45.580 --> 06:48.860
For 20 years,
no one in this house got any sleep.

06:51.300 --> 06:53.180
But now he sleeps like a baby.

06:55.820 --> 06:57.020
Thanks to you.

07:00.220 --> 07:03.420
And you, Ester, how are you ?

07:05.420 --> 07:10.140
Are you calm, like Attanasio ?
Or stormy, like the sea ?

07:18.020 --> 07:19.300
Stormy.

07:20.420 --> 07:23.620
Because... you see the danger ?

07:25.940 --> 07:27.900
- What danger ?
- Pleasure.

07:30.660 --> 07:34.100
A pleasure
you didn't experience before,

07:36.540 --> 07:37.780
didn't long for,

07:40.020 --> 07:41.940
didn't even know existed.

07:45.180 --> 07:48.580
An unexpected pleasure
is seeping into you,

07:50.140 --> 07:54.220
a sensation
you hadn't reckoned with.

07:55.860 --> 07:59.460
I know what I'm talking about, Ester.

08:01.980 --> 08:03.100
I know.

08:08.420 --> 08:11.580
A mother is capable of...

08:13.580 --> 08:15.860
anything in order to...

08:20.580 --> 08:24.620
I have to talk to you about something,
but I don't know how.

08:27.180 --> 08:29.740
Attanasio is not the only one.

08:33.220 --> 08:34.419
I don't understand.

08:34.580 --> 08:37.659
Attanasio is not the only one

08:37.900 --> 08:42.140
and I am not the only mother
who suffers.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.460
There are lots of us, Ester.

08:46.380 --> 08:49.460
Lots of well-off, unhappy parents

08:51.180 --> 08:54.500
with children
no one wants to look at,

08:55.060 --> 08:57.660
because nature
has turned against them.

09:01.700 --> 09:04.220
They are all waiting for you, Ester.

09:06.460 --> 09:11.100
You have a gift, which you are
finally beginning to recognize.

09:13.660 --> 09:16.700
- What gift ?
- The gift of human warmth.

09:18.900 --> 09:20.540
You're a saint, Ester !

09:25.620 --> 09:26.860
I am a whore.

09:30.260 --> 09:36.500
Do you know what the difference is
between a whore and a saint ?

09:41.740 --> 09:42.900
None.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.340
Forgive me, Eminence.
It's late.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.100
Have I disturbed you ?

12:50.300 --> 12:51.620
What have you discovered

12:51.700 --> 12:54.460
about Spalletta, Guicciardini,
and your husband ?

12:56.100 --> 13:01.300
All three of them frequent the same
under-age girl. At the same time.

13:02.220 --> 13:03.260
I see.

13:05.620 --> 13:07.820
You don't seem
particularly perturbed.

13:09.620 --> 13:11.500
I knew about Spalletta already.

13:13.220 --> 13:15.580
Guicciardini and your husband
are laymen.

13:15.700 --> 13:18.020
They concern me
only up to a certain point.

13:19.540 --> 13:21.140
That's all you have to say ?

13:43.620 --> 13:46.740
129 breaths. Then a sigh.

13:47.220 --> 13:50.180
- So they are still broadcasting ?
- Yes.

13:54.460 --> 13:58.460
It's not the only new developments.
There is another.

13:59.900 --> 14:05.980
A certain threesome who are operating
in a decidedly opaque manner.

14:06.940 --> 14:09.380
Both at the financial level,

14:10.020 --> 14:13.260
I am referring to various
unscrupulous operations

14:13.340 --> 14:17.940
carried out
by our own financial organization,

14:18.380 --> 14:20.060
and at the private level.

14:20.940 --> 14:27.340
The moral level, to be precise.
Would you like me to elaborate ?

14:51.980 --> 14:56.660
I detest politics and gossip
in equal measure,

14:56.820 --> 15:01.460
but in this little state of ours,
it seems impossible for even the pope

15:01.540 --> 15:04.700
to avoid matters
from unprecedented vulgarity.

15:05.820 --> 15:08.500
I am delighted to be here
and help you.

15:08.900 --> 15:12.900
That is convenient, Eminence,
for only you can help me.

15:13.940 --> 15:16.180
As it's you we're talking about.

15:23.460 --> 15:25.260
We need to rethink things.

15:26.100 --> 15:30.380
Certain behaviors, if made public,
would expose me,

15:30.500 --> 15:34.260
and people would say
John Paul III does nothing.

15:40.580 --> 15:42.460
Allow me to explain, Holy Father.

15:47.060 --> 15:49.540
Altbruck and I
are making Guicciardini happy.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.140
In exchange,

15:52.260 --> 15:56.300
he has dissuaded the prime minister
from taking lethal measures.

15:57.620 --> 16:01.500
Repealing the eight per thousand
wasn't the only item on the table.

16:03.380 --> 16:09.540
They were even considering introducing
a tax on the Church properties,

16:11.380 --> 16:13.220
effective retroactively.

16:14.900 --> 16:19.980
Let me remind you that we have
never paid taxes on our properties.

16:21.740 --> 16:27.580
You have any idea what it would mean
in economic terms for the Church ?

16:30.500 --> 16:31.620
A catastrophe.

16:33.580 --> 16:35.660
The Church doesn't want that,

16:36.420 --> 16:41.900
nor, obviously,
do those directly involved.

16:46.220 --> 16:48.940
There are only two people

16:49.780 --> 16:54.380
who could divulge the agreement
between Guicciardini, Altbruck and me.

16:55.700 --> 17:00.540
One is you, but you and I have...

17:01.980 --> 17:06.060
always affirmed
our mutual affection,

17:06.780 --> 17:09.500
rather than any inclination
to blackmail.

17:12.060 --> 17:13.980
The other is the Secretary of State

17:14.339 --> 17:15.460
who, however,

17:15.859 --> 17:21.780
has always tended
toward complete and total autonomy,

17:21.980 --> 17:23.859
even in regard to the pope,

17:25.859 --> 17:30.180
and who purses mysterious interests

17:30.580 --> 17:34.420
that are completely unknown
to everyone but himself.

17:37.780 --> 17:44.020
So, regarding the Secretary of State,
the situation is far more volatile,

17:44.980 --> 17:49.940
and you, Your Holiness,
are the only one who can diffuse it.

18:21.700 --> 18:25.300
Thomas Altbruck and Spalletta
are laundering money.

18:25.740 --> 18:29.100
They're paying Guicciardini
through offshore companies,

18:29.180 --> 18:32.580
withdrawing funds
from our financial structure.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.940
I make no moral judgment
regarding these operations.

18:42.140 --> 18:45.420
For me it's merely
a question of expediency.

18:46.100 --> 18:49.460
Sooner or later
some enterprising journalist

18:49.540 --> 18:53.700
will stick his nose in our business
and uncover everything.

18:54.460 --> 18:57.820
And you will be dragged
in to the ensuing scandal.

19:02.660 --> 19:06.700
Scandal leaves me indifferent,
as does reputation.

19:06.980 --> 19:10.300
Those are concerns
for the petite bourgeoisie.

19:11.020 --> 19:13.420
A class which I do not belong.

19:15.180 --> 19:20.620
I was thought proper form, polished
to perfection, becomes "mystical".

19:21.700 --> 19:23.260
As you like, Your Holiness.

19:31.060 --> 19:34.300
You know, Eminence,

19:37.500 --> 19:39.980
I am saying
that for your own good,

19:40.980 --> 19:45.940
perhaps it's time
you took the step back.

19:49.340 --> 19:51.380
I don't understand.
What do you mean ?

19:52.860 --> 19:55.980
Please, it will pain me
to spell it out for you.

19:56.700 --> 19:59.460
You understand perfectly well
what I mean.

20:02.460 --> 20:06.900
I am the longest-serving Secretary
of State in the history of the Church.

20:07.900 --> 20:11.860
- There must be a reason !
- There are hundreds, I am sure.

20:12.140 --> 20:16.460
But since you already hold
the record for service to the papacy,

20:17.380 --> 20:23.740
why not use the network you have
painstakingly constructed over decades

20:23.900 --> 20:26.620
in the vast wealth
of knowledge and experience

20:26.740 --> 20:30.020
you have acquired,
as a bequest to a new generation ?

20:30.860 --> 20:34.020
Represented by a new
Secretary of State, say...

20:35.020 --> 20:37.020
someone like Cardinal Assente.

20:39.140 --> 20:41.060
Are you asking or ordering me ?

20:42.660 --> 20:47.940
I do not like to have to choose
and I do not like giving orders.

20:49.260 --> 20:52.900
I do. I adore giving orders.

20:53.780 --> 20:55.060
It's my whole life.

21:39.300 --> 21:42.820
Schedule the interview.
I'm ready.

21:52.740 --> 21:55.620
- I was on my way to see you.
- How are you ?

21:55.980 --> 21:58.780
Tense. Essence planted
a cockroach in my car.

21:59.220 --> 22:02.140
Do you think he was trying
to intimidate me, Eminence ?

22:02.940 --> 22:05.740
A rather crude form of intimidation,
but yes.

22:05.820 --> 22:07.900
They want to make sure
you don't talk.

22:08.300 --> 22:11.340
- What am I supposed to do ?
- Don't talk.

22:13.260 --> 22:16.900
What's wrong ? You look different...
You look lifeless.

22:18.740 --> 22:19.820
Napoli lost.

22:32.260 --> 22:36.060
- You wanted to see me, Eminence ?
- Yes, rather urgently.

22:36.660 --> 22:39.900
I am transferring you.
Effective immediately.

22:39.980 --> 22:42.580
- You're promoting me ?
- Even better !

22:43.060 --> 22:46.620
- I'm making you a missionary.
- Where am I going ?

22:47.820 --> 22:48.820
To Kabul.

22:56.220 --> 22:57.340
Kabul ?

22:58.060 --> 23:01.340
But there are no Catholics
in Kabul !

23:02.060 --> 23:06.300
Exactly ! What does a missionary do ?
He begins.

23:06.780 --> 23:08.140
Why are you doing this ?

23:09.620 --> 23:14.740
In Kabul there are no pedophile priests
whose sins need to be covered.

23:16.500 --> 23:17.900
Goodbye Hernandez !

23:30.260 --> 23:31.500
I have to talk to you.

23:32.340 --> 23:36.020
Imperiously, and in violation
of all your demands,

23:36.140 --> 23:39.220
I have made some decisions
for a number of you.

23:39.900 --> 23:41.300
Sister Melanie,

23:41.420 --> 23:45.260
you will receive psychological
assistance twice a week, free of charge.

23:45.340 --> 23:47.060
Why ? This is outrageous.

23:47.220 --> 23:49.540
Because Sister Melanie
is a kleptomaniac.

23:50.500 --> 23:55.780
Sister Ivanka, on the other hand, will
be transferred to Sister Suree's care.

23:55.980 --> 23:59.020
- She will work for the pope.
- But why ?

23:59.820 --> 24:03.660
Because she is continually mistreated
and sexually harassed

24:03.780 --> 24:07.700
by three sisters
who shall remain nameless.

24:08.540 --> 24:11.700
Discretion, let it be remembered
through the centuries,

24:11.860 --> 24:15.860
has always been one of the greatest
attributes of the Secretary of State.

24:18.260 --> 24:22.380
Reverend Mother, you never
noticed Sister Ivanka's suffering,

24:22.580 --> 24:24.660
but I do not reproach you
in the least.

24:25.140 --> 24:27.820
You didn't notice it
because you are preoccupied

24:27.900 --> 24:30.020
by something
at the base of your breast.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.940
It is all you think about,

24:32.500 --> 24:35.540
but you cannot bring yourself
to confront the issue.

24:35.780 --> 24:38.740
So, I decided to confront it
for you.

24:40.220 --> 24:46.020
You have an appointment at the Gemelli
Hospital on Tuesday morning at 9:00.

24:46.140 --> 24:50.540
With Doctor Vilar.
One of the best oncologists in Rome.

24:57.940 --> 25:01.020
- How is it going ?
- Fine.

25:03.780 --> 25:05.100
But I'm scared.

25:05.740 --> 25:07.940
Don't be.
I have thought about you, too.

25:09.700 --> 25:13.900
I pretended that you sisters
presented me with a request,

25:14.060 --> 25:17.700
to be allowed to receive
orphans inside the convent.

25:17.980 --> 25:20.260
And I have authorized
your request.

25:20.660 --> 25:25.180
Caterina's baby will be the first
pretend orphan you will receive.

25:25.740 --> 25:28.660
Every now and then,
with every precaution,

25:29.420 --> 25:33.780
you will let Faisal see the baby,
inside the gardeners' shed.

25:34.340 --> 25:36.940
Not here.
It is too dangerous here.

25:38.020 --> 25:40.300
How do you know
all these things about us ?

25:40.540 --> 25:45.460
I am the longest-serving Secretary
of State in the history of the Church,

25:46.220 --> 25:49.500
and I have spent my life
informing myself.

25:50.460 --> 25:52.460
And now for you, Sister Lisette.

25:52.580 --> 25:55.660
I have something to say to you first,
Eminence.

25:56.780 --> 25:59.660
The wi-fi is slow
because you slowed it deliberately.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.580
You're afraid
that our protest will spread.

26:02.660 --> 26:06.140
I told you that you would be
a formidable adversary.

26:06.540 --> 26:09.580
At what point is our request
to meet with the Holy Father ?

26:09.780 --> 26:11.140
At a dead end.

26:12.100 --> 26:16.380
Because as of today I am no longer
the Secretary of State.

26:17.420 --> 26:20.580
When I leave here,
I will submit my resignation.

26:21.260 --> 26:26.380
And it will be accepted.
So you will have to file a new request,

26:27.140 --> 26:30.180
with the new Secretary of State,
Cardinal Assente.

26:31.580 --> 26:35.100
What do you advise us to do,
Eminence ?

26:36.420 --> 26:38.020
To carry on with your battle,

26:38.860 --> 26:42.220
you have not one
but a thousand reasons to.

26:43.140 --> 26:44.780
Thank you, Eminence.

26:48.380 --> 26:53.660
Do you know what is so awful about
these endless battles over rights ?

26:55.900 --> 26:57.780
There's no room left for poetry.

27:06.300 --> 27:08.260
What are you thinking
of naming him ?

27:09.900 --> 27:11.340
We haven't decided yet.

27:13.300 --> 27:16.460
May I suggest you name him Angelo ?
Like me.

27:19.060 --> 27:23.180
- And if it's a girl ?
- Still Angelo. It's a unisex name.

28:00.380 --> 28:04.780
Don Mimmo, if you don't mind
we'll spend a little time here with you.

28:06.940 --> 28:08.860
Like you, I like flowers.

28:09.860 --> 28:13.180
And today, I have brought you
the most beautiful one of all.

31:50.300 --> 31:53.020
- See you on Thursday ?
- No, Ester.

31:54.260 --> 31:55.980
Our relationship ends here.

31:59.020 --> 32:00.020
What ?

32:01.940 --> 32:02.940
Why ?

32:04.540 --> 32:08.620
Attanasio and the others
choose they are tired of this.

32:10.540 --> 32:12.820
Even they get bored
from routine.

32:14.820 --> 32:16.780
Attanasio is not tired of me.

32:18.020 --> 32:20.140
You're not a girl anymore, Ester.

32:22.900 --> 32:27.740
And we found some African women
who cost a lot less

32:29.620 --> 32:31.860
and are much younger than you.

32:33.820 --> 32:36.540
Besides you need
to think about your future.

32:38.140 --> 32:42.420
You were poor,
we've made you well-off.

32:43.460 --> 32:46.900
Now you have a nice house,
a babysitter,

32:49.540 --> 32:52.260
go find yourself a normal husband,

32:55.420 --> 32:56.540
do something else.

32:59.500 --> 33:03.940
What do you expect ?
That this would go on forever ?

33:04.820 --> 33:06.060
That's not the point.

33:10.580 --> 33:12.220
What is the point then ?

33:14.900 --> 33:15.900
The point is...

33:18.140 --> 33:19.660
is that I need Attanasio.

33:45.660 --> 33:48.540
That's exactly
what's not going to work.

33:49.820 --> 33:50.980
What are you saying ?

33:52.060 --> 33:54.620
Sex yes, love no ?

33:55.140 --> 33:57.100
- Precisely.
- I don't understand.

33:58.300 --> 34:00.020
You're such a fool, Ester.

34:01.580 --> 34:05.780
Sex has no value, because it lives
and dies in the present.

34:07.540 --> 34:08.620
But love doesn't.

34:09.620 --> 34:13.659
Love is dangerous,
because it looks to the future.

34:14.980 --> 34:19.020
What sort of future
could have be for you and Attanasio ?

34:19.139 --> 34:22.420
Every Thursday night,
when I come here, that's the future.

34:23.139 --> 34:26.699
And you wouldn't have to pay
another penny, if that's an issue.

34:28.340 --> 34:29.380
No !

34:30.900 --> 34:32.100
It ends here.

34:33.620 --> 34:35.699
Attanasio doesn't return your love.

34:39.340 --> 34:40.420
I see...

34:42.820 --> 34:47.179
- Only you can love Attanasio, right ?
- That's exactly right Ester.

34:49.260 --> 34:51.780
Only I can love Attanasio.

34:55.380 --> 34:57.340
In every sense.

37:16.300 --> 37:18.220
Shall I bring you your box, Sir ?

37:20.140 --> 37:23.980
I think that I can manage without it.
Thank you, Danny.

37:29.540 --> 37:33.100
Do you think they will watch me on TV ?
My parents ?

37:34.740 --> 37:37.100
Yes, I do.

39:09.340 --> 39:12.420
You are trembling. So am I.

39:23.500 --> 39:28.020
Holy Father, thank you. Words are
not enough to express my gratitude.

39:30.020 --> 39:33.100
Answering our questions
in a worldwide broadcast

39:33.260 --> 39:35.740
is an unparalleled privilege for us.

39:37.020 --> 39:40.620
And this is the first time
that such a thing has happened,

39:40.740 --> 39:45.020
a pontiff agreeing to a live,
free-ranging interview.

39:47.060 --> 39:50.060
- Thank you.
- Well then, let's get started.

39:52.100 --> 39:54.540
We have come to know
John Paul III.

39:56.260 --> 40:00.980
But we would also like to get to know
Sir John Brannox.

40:02.220 --> 40:05.420
Holy Father,
just who is John Brannox ?

40:06.660 --> 40:09.420
A priest who had, or has,

40:10.500 --> 40:15.580
the good fortune to be more loved
by God than he is by himself.

40:17.260 --> 40:18.660
And where did you grow up ?

40:19.740 --> 40:23.740
I spent almost my entire life
on our family's estate,

40:23.820 --> 40:25.380
on the outskirts of London.

40:26.140 --> 40:28.500
Together with my father,
my mother,

40:29.300 --> 40:31.740
once upon a time
my twin brother, Adam,

40:32.780 --> 40:35.740
and a thousand or so fallow deer.

40:37.100 --> 40:38.340
Your brother Adam...

40:40.180 --> 40:45.020
Your youth, Holy Father,
was scarred by a sorrowful event.

40:46.460 --> 40:48.660
One day,
while you were skiing together,

40:49.940 --> 40:53.060
your brother suddenly took ill
and died.

40:54.380 --> 40:56.580
I understand that the two of you
were very close.

40:58.180 --> 41:02.260
How did your life change
after that tragic event ?

41:13.780 --> 41:18.900
My grief, like all great sorrows,

41:19.020 --> 41:21.100
cannot be expressed in words.

41:21.180 --> 41:22.300
The dictionary

41:24.660 --> 41:28.220
does not contain
the adequate words.

41:31.580 --> 41:36.020
My life changed, but more importantly
my faith changed.

41:37.100 --> 41:40.860
Before Adam's death,
life was a long and quiet river,

41:41.100 --> 41:42.260
taken for granted.

41:43.300 --> 41:47.060
Perhaps pure and ritualistic even.

41:48.580 --> 41:52.580
But almost immediately,
after Adam's passing,

41:55.300 --> 42:00.140
a secret and scorching religiosity
penetrated me,

42:00.500 --> 42:02.220
something rocky and hidden.

42:05.180 --> 42:08.580
I closed myself off from the world.

42:10.060 --> 42:11.340
But that closure...

42:15.780 --> 42:20.380
began a sort
of hidden life of the heart.

42:21.740 --> 42:24.900
What Cardinal Newman
might have referred to

42:24.980 --> 42:27.380
as the "secret actions of the heart".

42:28.660 --> 42:33.820
And when the Holy Spirit breathed in me
and my life changed again,

42:34.540 --> 42:36.940
I was made pope
and bishop of Rome,

42:37.780 --> 42:41.980
I realized
that the time had come for me

42:42.220 --> 42:45.060
to offer up
to the Catholics of the world

42:47.140 --> 42:48.500
my secret devotion.

42:55.620 --> 42:57.340
An active devotion, then.

43:03.460 --> 43:05.340
Yes. An...

43:07.300 --> 43:08.460
... active devotion.

43:10.460 --> 43:14.900
What does it consist of ?
And what are your priorities ?

43:17.900 --> 43:18.900
Pardon ?

43:22.500 --> 43:26.940
What does it consist of ?
And what are your priorities ?

43:29.140 --> 43:31.300
My priority is evil.

43:36.380 --> 43:37.380
Evil that...

43:40.660 --> 43:43.900
must be look at openly,

43:45.740 --> 43:46.940
without hypocrisy,

43:48.580 --> 43:52.420
without distinctions,
without value scales.

43:54.860 --> 43:56.100
Evil is evil.

44:01.100 --> 44:03.700
In that case,
if you have no objection,

44:05.020 --> 44:07.340
I'd like to explore with you,
one at a time,

44:09.260 --> 44:13.780
all the aspects of this "evil"
that assails the church.

44:13.860 --> 44:18.540
I'm sure that you'll be happy to tell us
how the church intends to proceed.

44:20.940 --> 44:24.020
One of the most urgent themes

44:24.180 --> 44:28.140
is the wave
of sex abuse scandals

44:28.300 --> 44:30.580
that has swept over priests,
bishops, and cardinals.

44:30.660 --> 44:33.940
- Let's break off the interview.
- Are you mad ? We're live !

44:34.140 --> 44:36.420
What can the church do
to stop all this ?

44:38.980 --> 44:41.300
Believe me,
he's not going to make it.

44:41.660 --> 44:44.420
Of course he will,
he's just a little bit nervous.

44:44.940 --> 44:48.180
The Holy Father knows better
than anyone how to take the stage.

45:01.420 --> 45:03.940
- You don't get it, do you ?
- Get what ?

45:04.980 --> 45:06.620
He's in withdrawal, damn it !

45:14.380 --> 45:15.380
Excuse me.

45:44.780 --> 45:48.180
Forgive me, blessed Father,
if I have been loved.

45:50.060 --> 45:51.780
And if I have loved.

45:53.500 --> 45:57.580
Forgive me, blessed Father,
for it brought me pleasure.

46:57.860 --> 47:00.740
