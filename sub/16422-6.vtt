Hello?

42:44.763 --> 42:47.296
You're desperately clinging
to the tatters of a case

42:47.297 --> 42:50.096
because you're too stubborn
to admit you've rushed in

42:50.097 --> 42:51.429

when that poor girl was being
butchered in the city.

42:58.197 --> 43:01.596
All he did was try to save
her life when she arrived.

43:01.597 --> 43:04.296
Yes, he falsified the cause of death,

43:04.297 --> 43:09.096
but in response to the pleas
from her distraught mother.

43:09.097 --> 43:10.696
Now, if I stick her on the stand,

43:10.697 --> 43:15.063
the whole jury will think Dr.
Jack a hero.

43:15.064 --> 43:17.629
And when we're done, we
will go for compensation...

43:17.630 --> 43:20.462

- You would?
- Yes.

45:16.396 --> 45:17.964
Why?
