WEBVTT

01:54.481 --> 01:56.316
- Did you call for me,
honey?

01:57.417 --> 01:58.418
- No, Mom.

02:00.021 --> 02:01.723
- Huh, you're up early, kiddo.

02:01.756 --> 02:03.423
What can I get you for
breakfast?

02:03.457 --> 02:05.359
- Chocolate chip pancakes.

02:05.392 --> 02:06.561
- You got it, love bug.

02:08.029 --> 02:10.330
- And for the tracks,
do you think I'll win.

02:10.364 --> 02:11.633
- No, you won't.

02:11.666 --> 02:14.502
Because there's no finish
line, how can you win?

02:14.535 --> 02:16.104
- You just gotta make your own.

02:18.472 --> 02:19.741
I win!

02:31.986 --> 02:32.820
What's wrong?

02:35.523 --> 02:37.859
- I had another nightmare.

02:37.892 --> 02:41.562
- Kids, get dressed. We're
leaving in 20 minutes.

02:41.596 --> 02:42.830
Grab your things.

02:42.864 --> 02:44.565
- Don't forget our baseball
stuff.

03:25.707 --> 03:28.375
- Please, don't kill me! Don't
hurt me!

03:28.408 --> 03:29.209
Please!

03:29.242 --> 03:31.112
- Open the door!

03:31.145 --> 03:32.046
- Please!

03:35.049 --> 03:36.918
- Lucas, what are you
doing to her?

03:36.951 --> 03:40.420
- I hate you! I'm telling Mom
and Dad.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.673
- Mom, the camera.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.508
- Oh, here you go, hon.

04:00.541 --> 04:01.876
- Thanks.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.883
- Remember when we went
camping

04:08.916 --> 04:10.350
on our second date?

04:10.383 --> 04:11.219
- Hey, Dad.

04:12.220 --> 04:13.420
- Hey, Champ.

04:13.453 --> 04:15.590
Hey, you guys wanna know what
bears

04:15.623 --> 04:17.825
call people in sleeping bags?

04:17.859 --> 04:18.693
- What?

04:19.994 --> 04:20.928
- Soft tacos.

04:20.962 --> 04:21.796
- Stop it.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.067
- I don't get it.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.169
- He means the bears are gonna
eat us.

04:28.202 --> 04:30.337
- Lucas, leave your sister
alone.

04:31.506 --> 04:32.405
- Mom!

04:33.373 --> 04:37.044
I wanted to hit some high
pops today, but it's raining.

04:37.078 --> 04:39.647
- Oh, sweetie, no, the rain's
gonna clear, okay. I promise.

04:39.680 --> 04:40.748
Where's my hug.

04:40.782 --> 04:42.683
- I love you, Mom.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.118
- I love you too, sweetie.

04:45.553 --> 04:49.123
- Lucas, Lucas, Lucas,
Lucas, Lucas, Lucas!

04:51.225 --> 04:55.196
- Now batting, Lucas
Coyle! The crowd goes wild!

04:57.198 --> 04:57.999
Hey!

04:58.032 --> 04:58.866
- Shut up.

05:03.905 --> 05:05.106
Tessa, get the ball.

05:07.008 --> 05:08.609
What are you, scared? Get the
ball.

05:08.643 --> 05:10.878
- No, you threw the ball. Go get
it.

05:12.345 --> 05:13.214
- Get the ball!

05:13.247 --> 05:14.882
- Stop being a jerk.

05:14.916 --> 05:15.883
- Tessa!

05:15.917 --> 05:18.553
- Hey, kids, time to
eat!

05:29.664 --> 05:31.899
- We want food, we
want food, we want food!

05:31.933 --> 05:33.400
- Rich, how long till the
burgers?

05:33.433 --> 05:35.536
- Give me about five, hon.

05:35.570 --> 05:38.272
Now, Jack, it's important to
marinate

05:38.306 --> 05:41.108
the ketchup with the onions.

05:41.142 --> 05:46.147
So, the secret ingredient,
is sharp cheddar cheese.

05:46.180 --> 05:49.083
And you put it all on an
English muffin instead of a bun.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.418
- Hey, honey?
- Yeah?

05:51.451 --> 05:52.720
- Looks like it might storm.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.222
We might have to head back
tonight.

05:54.255 --> 05:56.090
- No, I think we'll be all
right.

05:56.123 --> 05:56.924
- Think so?

06:03.030 --> 06:04.098
- Dad?
- What?

06:04.999 --> 06:07.434
- Look, someone's watching us.

06:10.037 --> 06:10.872
- Hey.

06:11.939 --> 06:12.773
Hello.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.944
What are you doing over there?

06:33.493 --> 06:34.562
- Who was that?

06:34.595 --> 06:36.697
- It was just someone lost.
Nothing to worry about.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.378
- Where's Tessa?

06:53.014 --> 06:54.481
Where's Tessa? Tessa?

06:54.515 --> 06:55.883
- Tessa.

06:55.917 --> 06:57.484
- Hey, Tessa!

06:57.518 --> 06:59.387
- Tessa.
- Tessa!

07:01.822 --> 07:03.591
- You guys stay here
in case she comes back.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.457
- Okay.

07:09.597 --> 07:10.865
It's okay.

07:17.138 --> 07:17.972
- Out!

07:20.541 --> 07:21.375
- Oh, hi.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.476
What's your name?

07:25.046 --> 07:25.880
- Out.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.516
- My name's Tessa.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.053
I just need to get my ball.

07:32.086 --> 07:33.154
- Out!

07:39.492 --> 07:40.828
- It'll just take a minute.

08:03.584 --> 08:04.418
- Tessa!

08:05.987 --> 08:07.188
- You boys stay here, okay,
don't move!

08:07.221 --> 08:08.022
- Okay.

08:08.055 --> 08:08.889
- Help!

08:12.293 --> 08:13.127
- Tessa!

08:22.303 --> 08:23.137
No!

08:51.232 --> 08:55.336
- I hate you!
I'm telling Mom and Dad!

08:55.369 --> 08:56.871
Monsters are real!

09:20.661 --> 09:22.329
- You almost done, Jack?

09:22.363 --> 09:23.197
- Just about.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.835
- Huh, it's a shame you
never had a chance to work

09:27.868 --> 09:29.670
those old film projection
platters.

09:29.703 --> 09:32.273
They spin round and round,
and you had to know exactly

09:32.306 --> 09:35.109
when to switch the next
platter from a little pop

09:35.142 --> 09:37.845
in the corner of the screen in
between.

09:37.878 --> 09:40.848
It was a beautiful bit of
business when you got it right.

09:40.881 --> 09:43.451
Now you got buttons you push on
and off.

09:43.484 --> 09:45.152
There's no human element
anymore.

09:46.720 --> 09:49.256
- Are you sure you haven't
reconsidered selling this place?

09:49.290 --> 09:53.528
- Na, it's done. This place
is a relic now anyway.

10:21.455 --> 10:25.659
- Asked me if I'm
on drugs.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.361
I said, it's none of your
business.

10:27.394 --> 10:31.932
Then I.

10:54.523 --> 10:56.457
- Lucas!

10:56.490 --> 10:57.324
Lucas!

10:58.627 --> 11:01.662
- Now batting,
Lucas Coyle!

11:13.874 --> 11:16.645
- Hey, Mom, I got dinner.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.580
Chicken that you like.

11:18.613 --> 11:19.980
- Fried?

11:20.014 --> 11:20.848
- Grilled.

11:23.184 --> 11:24.285
Lucas.

11:25.452 --> 11:27.221
I told you, I brought dinner.

11:29.190 --> 11:29.957
Lucas.

11:50.477 --> 11:51.845
Luke, where are you?

12:13.767 --> 12:16.737
Lucas. Lucas, where are you?

12:22.910 --> 12:24.878
What the hell are you doing?

12:24.912 --> 12:26.715
You still haven't fixed that?

12:26.747 --> 12:28.282
- No, I will, all right?

12:29.383 --> 12:30.619
- It's been six months.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.622
How have you not done
this? What else do you do?

12:33.655 --> 12:34.788
- I said I'll fix it.

12:37.458 --> 12:39.059
- Oh, I bought you dinner.

12:39.093 --> 12:40.060
- I'm not hungry.

12:40.094 --> 12:42.129
- I know. I saw the mess
you left on the counter.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.065
You know what tomorrow is,
right?

12:45.099 --> 12:46.367
- Yes.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.737
- It means a lot to Mom.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.071
And Zoey'll be there?

12:53.374 --> 12:54.208
Your daughter.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.051
- So there are a lotta different
species

13:04.084 --> 13:04.918
that have parasites.

13:04.952 --> 13:08.155
You have humans, animals, plant
life,

13:08.188 --> 13:09.156
you know, those sorta things.

13:09.189 --> 13:12.092
- Right, but why doesn't
it just kill the host?

13:12.126 --> 13:13.894
- Well, the relationship between
the two

13:13.927 --> 13:16.230
is a version of symbiosis.

13:16.263 --> 13:18.700
I mean, in some ways, both
need each other to stay alive.

13:18.733 --> 13:20.801
It becomes mutualistic and
benign.

13:20.834 --> 13:23.270
- See, that's where I just get
confused.

13:23.304 --> 13:24.539
- That's okay.

13:24.572 --> 13:28.777
- Oh, we're gonna miss you, by
the way.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.210
- Aw, thank you, Riley.

13:30.244 --> 13:31.078
- Yeah.

13:35.583 --> 13:37.384
- I think he's got a crush on
you.

13:37.418 --> 13:38.319
- Oh, stop.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.623
Give me that. Okay.

14:18.660 --> 14:19.860
- You're up early,
kiddo.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.228
What can I get you for
breakfast?

14:21.261 --> 14:24.733
- Chocolate chip
pancakes.

14:24.766 --> 14:27.368
- You got it, love bug.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.238
- Amherst Bay, huh?

14:31.271 --> 14:33.107
- It's nothing too fancy.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.175
- Got a big backyard. That's
pretty cool.

14:35.209 --> 14:36.176
- Yeah.

14:36.210 --> 14:39.413
Maybe I'll get a dog,
name her Rizzo.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.917
You sure you don't wanna come?

14:46.253 --> 14:47.087
- I don't know.

14:47.955 --> 14:50.224
- You're not their babysitter,
Jack.

14:50.257 --> 14:51.325
They're grownups.

14:52.993 --> 14:55.730
One day, you're gonna have to
start living your own life.

14:57.632 --> 14:58.999
I'm sorry.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.135
I'm sorry. I know you don't
like to talk about it.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.002
- No, it's okay.

15:05.305 --> 15:07.675
I came here to congratulate you.

15:07.709 --> 15:11.679
This is crazy you're
gonna be a vice principal.

15:11.713 --> 15:12.946
- I know.

15:12.980 --> 15:13.914
I know, ah.

15:15.850 --> 15:17.585
- I got something for you.

15:17.619 --> 15:18.452
- Oh boy.

15:20.921 --> 15:21.856
Oh my God.

15:23.625 --> 15:25.225
- Crazy, right?

15:25.259 --> 15:27.027
- Wow, I remember this.

15:27.896 --> 15:28.929
Yeah.

15:28.962 --> 15:32.065
You weren't going, and
my boyfriend dumped me

15:32.099 --> 15:34.234
so he could take Debbie
Shellhorn.

15:35.936 --> 15:37.772
And then you stepped up.

15:43.177 --> 15:44.011
- What is it?

15:45.078 --> 15:48.683
- Why are we just friends? Tell
me again.

15:50.451 --> 15:53.454
- Look, you don't have to come
tonight if you don't want to.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.625
- Is that why you brought me
coffee?

15:57.659 --> 16:00.829
- No, I just hate pulling
you into my family's drama.

16:00.862 --> 16:02.362
- You are not pulling me in.

16:04.231 --> 16:05.934
And I'm not afraid of them
either.

16:07.301 --> 16:08.235
Oh my God.

16:10.839 --> 16:13.808
This is, wow, I can't
believe you kept this.

16:13.842 --> 16:14.642
- Had to.

16:14.676 --> 16:15.510
- I.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.767
- I decided Zoey can stay in
this room

16:39.801 --> 16:41.870
till Tessa comes back.

16:46.006 --> 16:47.307
- Okay.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.967
- Hey, Uncle Jack.

17:13.001 --> 17:14.002
- Hey, Zoey, how's it going?

17:14.034 --> 17:15.537
- Good, where's Dad?

17:15.570 --> 17:17.471
- He wasn't feeling good, but
he'll be back at the house.

17:17.505 --> 17:18.405
How was school?

17:20.073 --> 17:20.875
- Okay.

17:20.909 --> 17:21.943
- Just okay?
- Mm-hm.

17:21.976 --> 17:22.877
- All right. Why don't you
give me a minute, okay?

17:22.911 --> 17:23.912
I wanna talk to Mom.

17:25.379 --> 17:28.750
- So Lucas decided not to
show up again, huh? Typical.

17:29.717 --> 17:32.452
Listen, I know we decided on
just this weekend originally,

17:32.486 --> 17:35.590
but is there any way that, um?

17:37.090 --> 17:38.593
There's this whole shit
show going on at work

17:38.626 --> 17:40.995
with his girl, man, fucking
bitch.

17:41.863 --> 17:45.165
Can you, um, look, I
don't know about Monday.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.703
- Shouldn't you be asking her
father?

17:49.804 --> 17:51.773
- Oh cut the shit, Jack, we
all know that you're the one

17:51.806 --> 17:53.541
who makes the decisions around
here.

17:53.575 --> 17:55.543
It's not like he responds to me
anyway.

17:56.578 --> 17:58.780
- Can you at least
pretend to be her mother?

17:59.881 --> 18:02.349
Can't you see what you're
putting her through?

18:06.554 --> 18:08.088
- She wasn't my idea.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.226
Look, I'll come get
her on Wednesday, okay?

18:13.260 --> 18:14.094
Is that good?

18:16.363 --> 18:17.599
She likes being with you.

18:18.600 --> 18:20.568
And your mom would like to have
her.

18:20.602 --> 18:21.869
Right, Zoey?

18:21.903 --> 18:22.737
- What?

18:24.005 --> 18:27.174
- Hey, any chance I could get
like 10 bucks for gas back?

18:27.207 --> 18:29.811
I'm on empty, and I don't
get paid till next Friday.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.515
- Take it.

18:34.549 --> 18:36.050
- Thanks.

18:36.084 --> 18:39.286
Okay , bye. You're
the best.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.253
King Jack!

18:41.188 --> 18:42.189
- You all right?

18:42.222 --> 18:43.691
- Mm-hm.

18:50.464 --> 18:52.634
- Okay, Zoey, come on over here.

18:52.667 --> 18:55.268
You can blow out the candle this
year.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.370
- Are you sure?

18:56.403 --> 18:59.907
- Yes, come on.

19:02.342 --> 19:03.176
Okay.

19:05.479 --> 19:07.582
I'm gonna sing a little
song, then you blow it out.

19:07.615 --> 19:08.650
- Okay.

19:08.683 --> 19:11.919
♪ Happy birthday, Tessa,
happy birthday, Tessa ♪

19:11.953 --> 19:14.287
♪ Happy birthday, Tessa ♪

19:14.321 --> 19:15.155
- Okay.

19:16.124 --> 19:17.892
Yay!

19:19.393 --> 19:20.995
Okay.

19:21.029 --> 19:24.532
Okay. I'm gonna cut the cake
now.

19:24.565 --> 19:27.702
I know everybody wants a slice.

19:27.735 --> 19:30.370
No no, where are you going,
Lucas?

19:30.404 --> 19:31.706
Hey, no, no no.

19:31.739 --> 19:34.075
Everybody has to stay
and have a piece of cake.

19:35.610 --> 19:36.778
Ugh.

19:36.811 --> 19:41.149
You know, I ask for one
thing every damn year.

19:41.181 --> 19:43.383
Why can't I have that?

19:43.417 --> 19:45.620
- It's been 25 years, Mom.

19:45.653 --> 19:48.422
We're still celebrating
Tessa's eighth birthday?

19:49.423 --> 19:51.425
We don't even celebrate our own
birthdays.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.529
We don't even celebrate
Zoey's, and she's still alive!

19:56.864 --> 20:01.903
- We celebrate Tessa's birthday
because she's not here.

20:01.936 --> 20:03.004
And we owe here that!

20:03.037 --> 20:05.305
- We don't owe her anything!

20:08.509 --> 20:09.342
- Oh.

20:10.978 --> 20:11.813
Oh.

20:12.680 --> 20:14.549
Tessa's cake.

20:14.582 --> 20:15.415
Oh.

20:16.517 --> 20:18.119
Oh.

20:18.152 --> 20:19.252
You.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.988
- You!
- Hey, Mom!

20:21.022 --> 20:22.123
- You!
- Stop it!

20:22.156 --> 20:24.058
- Stop, Mom. Mom, stop it!

20:24.092 --> 20:25.292
Tessa is dead!

20:27.128 --> 20:30.263
Dad's dead. They're both fucking
dead.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.332
- No! You're wrong!

20:33.201 --> 20:37.672
She's coming back. She just
disappeared.

20:37.705 --> 20:39.406
She's still out there.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.642
- Not in front of Zoey, please.

20:42.844 --> 20:44.979
- If both of you had supported
me,

20:45.012 --> 20:47.215
if both of you had listened to
me,

20:47.247 --> 20:50.618
if you'd both been better big
brothers

20:50.651 --> 20:52.954
and taken care of your sister,

20:52.987 --> 20:55.089
maybe she'd be here now

20:55.123 --> 20:57.525
and not out there wondering
where her mother is!

21:00.460 --> 21:03.598
We could never have a nice time
with you.

21:03.631 --> 21:04.599
- What do you want? What
do you want from me!

21:04.632 --> 21:06.601
Do you want me to say I'm sorry,
again?

21:08.301 --> 21:11.806
- Maybe you both have lost
faith,

21:12.940 --> 21:14.108
but I haven't.

21:15.243 --> 21:16.644
She is out there.

21:17.678 --> 21:19.847
And she's coming back.

21:25.553 --> 21:26.521
Get out.

21:28.589 --> 21:30.024
Just get outta here.

21:31.793 --> 21:32.960
Get outta my house!

21:34.095 --> 21:38.032
I want all your stuff
outta here by the morning!

21:38.065 --> 21:38.866
- Done.

21:38.900 --> 21:39.867
- Good!

21:44.071 --> 21:47.474
No!

21:56.984 --> 21:57.819
- What?

21:59.821 --> 22:00.655
Uh.

22:01.889 --> 22:02.824
- Are you okay?

22:04.225 --> 22:07.028
I don't like it when you and
Grandma yell at each other.

22:08.830 --> 22:10.865
- I don't like it either.

22:10.898 --> 22:13.634
- Why does she keep saying
Aunt Tessa's coming back?

22:13.668 --> 22:14.969
I don't understand.

22:16.270 --> 22:17.905
- Hey, good news.

22:17.939 --> 22:20.473
You don't have to sleep
on the couch anymore.

22:20.508 --> 22:21.609
- Really?

22:21.642 --> 22:23.911
- It's Tessa's old room
actually.

22:23.945 --> 22:25.445
I helped Grandma clean it out.

22:26.413 --> 22:27.380
- Do you want some?

22:30.350 --> 22:32.220
- Thank you, Princess.

22:47.034 --> 22:48.269
This is for you.

22:50.204 --> 22:51.072
That was Tessa's.

22:53.373 --> 22:54.508
I think you should have it.

22:54.542 --> 22:56.110
- Thank you.

22:56.143 --> 22:57.645
It's pretty.

23:04.752 --> 23:05.553
- I love you.

23:06.787 --> 23:08.022
You know that, right?

23:08.055 --> 23:09.857
- I love you too, Dad.

23:21.434 --> 23:22.570
- Demonstration.

23:22.603 --> 23:24.605
You are gonna be red. I'm gonna
be black.

23:24.639 --> 23:27.275
So if I roll the die, I get a
two.

23:27.308 --> 23:28.843
So, basically--

23:56.837 --> 23:58.906
Your opponent across from you.

23:58.940 --> 23:59.774
- Mom?

24:00.942 --> 24:01.776
You okay?

24:03.978 --> 24:06.080
- Yeah, it's just your brother.

24:06.914 --> 24:08.516
He ruins everything.

24:11.786 --> 24:13.688
- How many years are we gonna do
this?

24:15.189 --> 24:16.489
We've searched everywhere.

24:17.391 --> 24:19.060
So have the police.

24:20.094 --> 24:21.595
We've hired private
investigators.

24:21.629 --> 24:23.764
We've spent money we don't have.

24:24.765 --> 24:26.267
We've exhausted everything.

24:28.035 --> 24:29.270
It's time we move on.

24:30.905 --> 24:32.940
We all know what happened out
there, Mom.

24:34.542 --> 24:36.877
And you're the only one
who hasn't accepted it.

24:40.982 --> 24:43.651
- You don't understand the
truth.

25:27.995 --> 25:29.663
- It was your fault!

25:30.831 --> 25:31.632
- No.

25:31.665 --> 25:33.768
- Now, it wants you.

25:33.801 --> 25:34.635
- Go away!

25:35.903 --> 25:37.905
- Lucas, please!

25:52.787 --> 25:54.121
- Open the door!

25:55.356 --> 25:57.658
Lucas, what are you doing to
her!

25:57.691 --> 26:00.529
- I hate you! I'm telling Mom
and Dad!

26:17.611 --> 26:20.147
- It's okay, Lucas, come
in.

26:45.906 --> 26:48.409
- Tessa, is that, is that you?

26:51.612 --> 26:52.680
I'm so sorry.

26:55.416 --> 26:56.484
I'm so sorry.

26:58.385 --> 27:00.888
- I've been waiting for you,
Lucas.

27:00.921 --> 27:05.926
Do you want to hit some
high pops?

27:25.746 --> 27:27.181
- It wasn't my fault!

27:28.617 --> 27:29.884
It wasn't my fault!

27:50.404 --> 27:51.972
It wasn't my fault!

28:10.991 --> 28:11.825
- Lucas.

28:12.860 --> 28:14.028
Lucas!

28:14.061 --> 28:14.895
Lucas!

28:25.574 --> 28:28.175
- Thank you so much for being
here today,

28:29.076 --> 28:32.913
so that we may share in
the life of Lucas Coyle.

28:32.947 --> 28:35.650
Whenever I'm called upon to
speak at a time like this,

28:36.685 --> 28:40.622
I'm often directed to the words
of Moses,

28:40.655 --> 28:43.324
specifically, Psalm 90.

28:44.758 --> 28:47.696
Teach us to number our days

28:47.728 --> 28:50.532
that we may gain a heart of
wisdom.

28:53.834 --> 28:56.870
Teach us to number our days

28:56.904 --> 28:58.872
so that we may gain a heart of
wisdom.

29:00.941 --> 29:02.876
- I'm so sorry
for your loss, Jack.

29:02.910 --> 29:04.546
If there's anything you need,
let me know.

29:04.579 --> 29:05.746
- Are you thirsty?

29:10.652 --> 29:12.654
You look like your father in
that suit.

29:16.890 --> 29:18.959
I don't wanna do this.

29:18.993 --> 29:22.363
All these people, looking
at me, judging me,

29:22.396 --> 29:27.067
like what kinda mother would
let her son get to that point?

29:27.101 --> 29:28.168
- No one thinks that.

29:30.572 --> 29:32.006
- I wanna spread his ashes.

29:36.477 --> 29:37.878
What's he doing here?

29:37.911 --> 29:39.947
- Just say hi, Mom.

29:39.980 --> 29:40.948
- I'm gonna go wait in the car.

29:40.981 --> 29:43.150
- We need to wait till
everyone leaves, Mom.

29:46.420 --> 29:47.656
- Jack.

29:47.689 --> 29:49.123
- Really happy you came.

29:49.156 --> 29:50.659
- Lucas meant the world to me.

29:51.792 --> 29:53.394
- I know.

29:53.427 --> 29:54.663
- Did you know that we've been
talking

29:54.696 --> 29:56.631
the last couple months?

29:56.665 --> 29:57.498
- Really?

29:58.566 --> 30:00.702
- It was a big step for him to
reach out.

30:00.735 --> 30:02.870
I thought he was finally getting
it.

30:02.903 --> 30:04.438
Even came to a few meetings.

30:06.206 --> 30:07.241
- I didn't know that.

30:08.743 --> 30:10.512
- Listen, when you're ready to
talk,

30:11.478 --> 30:13.314
you know where to find me.

30:13.347 --> 30:14.716
- I will. Thank you.

30:14.749 --> 30:15.550
- I love you, Jack.

30:15.583 --> 30:16.417
- Love you too.

30:19.286 --> 30:20.588
- Has the family had time
to say

30:20.622 --> 30:22.056
their final farewells?

30:24.058 --> 30:25.560
- Yeah, okay.

30:56.825 --> 30:57.659
Zoey!

30:58.593 --> 30:59.993
What's wrong? Are you okay?

31:00.027 --> 31:00.928
- Zoey, honey, are you--

31:00.961 --> 31:03.832
- There's something in there
with Daddy!

31:06.166 --> 31:07.669
Uncle Jack, please don't!

31:18.078 --> 31:21.583
- It was nothing, Zoey. It's
okay.

31:21.616 --> 31:24.184
- We're here for you, sweetie.
Okay?

31:24.218 --> 31:26.420
Here, come here, baby, sh.

31:31.125 --> 31:32.226
- Say hi to your mama.

31:38.332 --> 31:39.166
How did he look?

31:40.234 --> 31:41.503
- You could have come in.

31:41.536 --> 31:43.270
- Don't do too well at these
things.

31:43.303 --> 31:45.774
- Sometimes you have to do
things you don't wanna do.

31:45.807 --> 31:46.940
- I know, I know.

31:48.008 --> 31:49.511
Hey, baby.

31:49.544 --> 31:51.178
Look, I'm sorry I'm late.

31:51.211 --> 31:54.381
I had to stop somewhere because
I wanted to get you this.

31:56.950 --> 31:59.052
- Hey, Steff, let's bounce.

31:59.086 --> 32:00.254
Let's go.

32:00.287 --> 32:01.188
- Give us a second.

32:01.221 --> 32:02.990
- So sorry about your brother,
man.

32:03.957 --> 32:04.793
No, not you.

32:06.561 --> 32:07.629
- Jack, can you, um?

32:09.697 --> 32:12.332
I'm obviously going through a
really rough time right now,

32:13.367 --> 32:14.201
and can Zoey ...

32:17.739 --> 32:18.873
I need you to take her.

32:20.073 --> 32:21.910
- You're seriously leaving right
now?

32:23.944 --> 32:25.245
- I'm sorry.

32:27.882 --> 32:28.716
Bye, sweetie pie.

32:29.684 --> 32:31.385
- Where are you going?

32:31.418 --> 32:33.755
- Stay with your Uncle
Jack for a smidge, okay.

32:35.088 --> 32:37.090
You know how your mom gets.

32:39.993 --> 32:41.729
- Hey, let's go to Grandma,
okay?

32:41.763 --> 32:43.765
I'm gonna take you to the car.

32:43.798 --> 32:44.599
- Okay.

32:44.632 --> 32:45.466
- All right, let's go.

32:49.336 --> 32:51.673
- Hey, you think you can
help me out a little?

32:51.706 --> 32:53.373
Anybody leave any money
in those cards in there?

32:53.407 --> 32:55.976
- Yeah, they did, but it's for
Zoey.

32:56.009 --> 32:57.512
- I just wanted to have
a few friends over,

32:57.545 --> 33:00.247
you know, for a little
thing to celebrate Luke.

33:00.280 --> 33:01.816
Think you could chip in for it?

33:03.952 --> 33:04.786
- I'm done.

33:07.454 --> 33:08.288
- Okay.

33:10.190 --> 33:13.795
Never mind.

33:13.828 --> 33:15.028
- How much you get?

33:15.062 --> 33:16.096
- Nothing.

33:16.129 --> 33:17.064
- Nothing?

33:17.097 --> 33:18.933
- Just leave me alone.

33:45.325 --> 33:47.060
- What are you doing?

33:48.395 --> 33:49.463
- I miss him.

33:53.400 --> 33:54.802
- I miss him too.

33:55.970 --> 33:57.705
You know, when we were kids,

33:57.739 --> 34:00.140
Tessa was afraid to put
her hands in the cement.

34:01.776 --> 34:03.277
So your dad did it first.

34:05.045 --> 34:06.514
He was brave, just like you.

34:10.685 --> 34:11.986
- Someone's here.

34:18.593 --> 34:19.961
- Mommy.

34:23.430 --> 34:25.900
- Do you ever hear voices?

34:28.068 --> 34:29.169
- What kind of voices?

34:31.371 --> 34:33.675
- I mean voices that aren't
really there.

34:35.475 --> 34:36.711
- Do you?

34:36.744 --> 34:40.380
- Could it be the thing
that's buried in the basement?

34:40.414 --> 34:41.481
- Who told you that?

34:42.717 --> 34:45.053
- I heard you and my
dad talk about it once.

34:48.923 --> 34:50.992
What if he's trying to tell me
something?

34:52.426 --> 34:53.327
- Come here.

35:21.154 --> 35:23.524
- Hey.

35:23.558 --> 35:25.392
- Hey, Jack. Glad you came.

35:28.362 --> 35:29.496
How you holding up?

35:32.800 --> 35:35.903
- To be honest, not good.

35:37.337 --> 35:38.706
- To be honest, that's natural.

35:38.740 --> 35:40.575
You're not supposed to feel
good, Jack.

35:41.676 --> 35:42.677
- Place looks great.

35:43.811 --> 35:46.279
- Yeah. A Heritage Museum.

35:48.549 --> 35:50.450
Honor the past, just don't live
in it.

35:53.855 --> 35:55.123
What's on your mind, Jack?

35:58.191 --> 36:00.360
- What did you and Lucas talk
about

36:00.394 --> 36:01.696
the last time you saw him?

36:03.798 --> 36:04.632
- He was using.

36:06.968 --> 36:09.037
He wanted to get better for
Zoey.

36:09.070 --> 36:10.237
He knew she needed him,

36:11.271 --> 36:13.206
but his demons were still too
strong.

36:14.509 --> 36:15.409
How's your mother?

36:16.243 --> 36:17.712
- The same.

36:17.745 --> 36:20.247
They have her on four
different meds right now.

36:20.280 --> 36:21.849
I know they're making her
physically sick,

36:21.883 --> 36:23.685
and none of them seem to be
helping.

36:25.820 --> 36:27.454
- I hate your mother's doctors.

36:27.487 --> 36:28.656
- It helped at first.

36:28.690 --> 36:30.158
- You really think so?

36:30.190 --> 36:31.059
- I don't know.

36:31.092 --> 36:33.293
- Your mother is addicted to her
meds.

36:34.361 --> 36:36.064
She's my sister.

36:36.097 --> 36:37.765
I knew her before all this
happened,

36:37.799 --> 36:40.735
and I've seen the wonderful
person inside.

36:40.768 --> 36:41.602
- I know.

36:42.570 --> 36:44.539
She won't change.

36:44.572 --> 36:45.540
- But she can.

36:46.473 --> 36:48.710
It happens. People do it all the
time.

36:48.743 --> 36:50.178
But she chooses not to.

36:50.210 --> 36:53.313
She replays that day over and
over again.

36:53.346 --> 36:54.582
She just won't accept

36:55.817 --> 36:58.251
that Tessa and your father are
gone.

37:00.320 --> 37:02.690
And with Lucas gone, I'm
afraid she's gonna drift

37:02.724 --> 37:05.126
deeper and deeper until
there's no reaching her.

37:07.628 --> 37:09.897
Jack, don't fall into your own
loop.

37:10.732 --> 37:12.232
That would be a real tragedy.

37:14.367 --> 37:16.336
- Thanks.
- Yeah, whew.

37:18.039 --> 37:20.908
- So, how's Zoey doing?

37:20.942 --> 37:22.009
- She's gonna stay with us for a
while

37:22.043 --> 37:23.845
until Steffi gets her shit
together.

37:24.679 --> 37:27.615
- I can't imagine what that
little girl is going through.

37:27.648 --> 37:29.483
- I wanna give her some sense of
normalcy,

37:29.517 --> 37:31.119
something Lucas and I never had.

37:32.754 --> 37:34.387
- She just needs some guidance.

37:36.256 --> 37:38.159
That's all any of us are looking
for.

37:41.461 --> 37:43.598
- We're gonna spread
Lucas' ashes tomorrow.

37:46.701 --> 37:48.903
It would mean a lot to
me if you were there.

37:50.838 --> 37:52.707
- Then I will be there.

37:56.244 --> 37:57.245
- Bye.
- Bye.

38:31.746 --> 38:33.014
- You all right?

39:02.076 --> 39:04.444
Are you sure this is the right
place?

39:05.279 --> 39:06.247
- Absolutely.

39:09.250 --> 39:11.052
- Do you wanna say something?

39:15.156 --> 39:18.993
Lucas, I just want you to
know that I love you, and uh,

39:22.763 --> 39:23.598
I'm sorry.

39:26.334 --> 39:28.468
Do you have the urn, sweetie?

39:35.877 --> 39:38.378
Where is it? Where's the urn?

39:38.411 --> 39:41.015
- I don't know. You guys had it.

39:41.048 --> 39:42.415
- I thought you had it.

39:42.449 --> 39:45.152
- I didn't have it. I thought
you held onto it, sweetie.

39:47.355 --> 39:48.956
All right, come on.

39:51.592 --> 39:53.361
- You lost it, Jack.

39:55.863 --> 39:57.732
- How could I have misplaced
this?

39:57.765 --> 39:59.166
How could it just disappear?

39:59.200 --> 40:00.601
- Maybe somebody took it.

40:02.169 --> 40:03.037
- I don't know.

40:03.070 --> 40:05.072
Mom, please, if you see it, let
me know.

40:05.106 --> 40:06.240
I'm gonna go check in the car.

40:06.274 --> 40:08.809
- All right, I'll come with
you. We'll be back, okay?

40:13.714 --> 40:16.150
- Did Tessa really disappear out
here?

40:17.285 --> 40:18.119
- She did.

40:19.787 --> 40:21.454
- How do you know?

40:21.488 --> 40:24.125
- Well, we couldn't find her.

40:24.158 --> 40:24.992
We just

40:26.761 --> 40:27.828
lost her.

40:32.767 --> 40:34.902
- Do you really think
she's still out here?

40:36.337 --> 40:37.171
- I do.

40:39.173 --> 40:41.275
- Why didn't you continue
looking for her?

40:45.146 --> 40:49.183
- Zoey, do you wanna go
look for Tessa with me?

40:55.656 --> 40:56.657
- Where did they go?

40:58.960 --> 41:00.261
- Tessa!

41:01.662 --> 41:03.463
- Tessa!

41:03.496 --> 41:04.832
- Tessa!
- Tessa!

41:08.169 --> 41:11.138
- Tessa, where are you?

41:11.172 --> 41:12.006
Tessa!

41:13.908 --> 41:14.742
- Tessa!

41:21.916 --> 41:23.718
- Grandma, are you okay?

41:28.222 --> 41:29.690
My Grandma's hurt!

41:30.624 --> 41:31.959
Can you help me?

41:35.796 --> 41:38.532
I'm gonna get help. Please be
okay.

41:49.243 --> 41:50.077
- Mom!

41:52.246 --> 41:53.080
Zoey!

41:54.348 --> 41:55.182
Mom!

41:56.684 --> 41:58.285
Zoey!

41:58.319 --> 41:59.353
She's not here.

42:01.689 --> 42:02.923
Go back to the car.

42:02.957 --> 42:05.826
There's a gun in the trunk,
under the spare tire.

42:05.860 --> 42:07.495
- Jack, you're scaring me.

42:07.528 --> 42:09.597
- This isn't gonna happen again.

42:10.631 --> 42:12.800
- Okay, all right.

42:12.833 --> 42:13.667
- Mom!

42:14.935 --> 42:15.770
Zoey!

42:23.144 --> 42:23.978
- Zoey?

42:27.815 --> 42:28.649
Is that you?

42:55.609 --> 42:57.478
- Mom? Mom, wake up.

42:57.512 --> 42:59.046
Are you okay?

42:59.080 --> 43:00.381
Where is Zoey?

43:02.650 --> 43:03.484
Mom!

43:08.923 --> 43:10.057
- 911, what's your
emergency?

43:10.091 --> 43:12.193
- My mom has collapsed.

43:12.226 --> 43:14.395
She's breathing but
otherwise unresponsive.

43:51.098 --> 43:55.636
- Zoey, where are you?

43:55.669 --> 43:56.804
Where did you go?

43:57.771 --> 43:58.607
Zoey? Zoey?

44:01.308 --> 44:02.409
- Who are you calling?

44:05.913 --> 44:07.549
Do you think she's gonna be
okay?

44:16.625 --> 44:18.125
- What is this?

44:18.159 --> 44:19.026
- What are you doing here, Zoey?

44:19.059 --> 44:20.394
- Grandma fell to the ground.

44:20.427 --> 44:22.163
This nice lady is calling for
help.

44:24.932 --> 44:26.568
- Hang up the phone.

44:46.687 --> 44:47.988
Where did you get this?

44:48.022 --> 44:49.990
- You need, yours.

44:50.925 --> 44:53.160
- Zoey, let's go. Come on, let's
go.

44:57.666 --> 44:59.833
- You were there that day,
weren't you?

45:04.271 --> 45:08.742
Stay away from me, and
stay away from my family!

45:33.834 --> 45:35.169
- What is that, Uncle Jack?

45:39.574 --> 45:40.741
- Go to the car.

45:40.774 --> 45:43.210
Liz is at the car. Lock the
doors.

45:43.244 --> 45:45.479
Okay, lock the doors. Go!

45:54.355 --> 45:55.422
- Liz, something's out there.

45:55.456 --> 45:57.726
- Zoey, get in the car.

45:57.758 --> 46:01.228
Lock the door. Don't
open it until I get back!

46:09.671 --> 46:11.071
What the hell was that?

46:31.258 --> 46:32.926
- Is Grandma gonna be okay?

46:34.596 --> 46:36.765
- She will, I promise. Don't
worry.

46:38.966 --> 46:40.602
- What attacked us, Uncle Jack?

46:44.271 --> 46:45.072
- I don't know. I--

46:45.105 --> 46:46.940
- Is it gonna come after us
again?

46:46.974 --> 46:47.808
- No, it won't.

46:49.243 --> 46:50.077
- I shot it.

46:50.978 --> 46:53.213
- So, it won't get us?

46:53.247 --> 46:54.081
- No.

46:56.317 --> 46:57.818
It's gonna be okay, all right?

46:59.453 --> 47:00.287
- Okay.

47:04.793 --> 47:05.627
- Mr. Coyle?

47:07.828 --> 47:08.663
Mr. Coyle?

47:13.568 --> 47:14.703
- How's she doing?

47:14.736 --> 47:16.236
- She's doing better. She was
dehydrated.

47:16.270 --> 47:19.206
That's part of the reason
why she lost consciousness.

47:19.239 --> 47:20.642
- What's really going on?

47:20.675 --> 47:22.544
- When was the last time she saw
a doctor?

47:22.577 --> 47:23.578
- It was like two years ago.

47:23.611 --> 47:25.446
She doesn't like going to the
doctor's.

47:25.479 --> 47:27.881
- Well that's unfortunate,
because her blood pressure's

47:27.915 --> 47:30.685
really low, and there are some
vitals

47:30.719 --> 47:32.252
of hers that are concerning me.

47:33.655 --> 47:35.222
I don't wanna jump to any
conclusions,

47:35.255 --> 47:37.491
and it's hard to tell,
but she should really

47:37.525 --> 47:38.892
go see her primary doctor.

47:41.195 --> 47:41.995
- Okay.

47:47.968 --> 47:49.604
- We went out
to spread Lucas' ashes,

47:49.637 --> 47:52.873
and my mom collapsed out in the
woods.

47:54.007 --> 47:55.342
We almost lost her.

47:55.376 --> 47:57.111
- And what'd the doctor say?

47:57.144 --> 47:58.546
- It's what they didn't say.

48:00.548 --> 48:02.316
- What aren't you telling me,
Jack?

48:04.652 --> 48:05.953
- Something was out there.

48:06.887 --> 48:07.921
- What do you mean something?

48:09.657 --> 48:10.491
- I'm not sure.

48:13.828 --> 48:15.295
I know this may sound weird.

48:18.098 --> 48:18.966
It wasn't human.

48:26.440 --> 48:30.712
- I think people create
monsters, real or imagined.

48:31.613 --> 48:34.481
But you know, I looked
in the mirror one day,

48:35.349 --> 48:36.917
and I didn't like what I saw.

48:36.950 --> 48:39.286
And I realized if I didn't get
sober,

48:39.319 --> 48:40.522
it was gonna consume me.

48:42.524 --> 48:43.825
- How'd you get through it?

48:45.993 --> 48:48.596
- Okay, so,

48:48.630 --> 48:50.264
there are these two bull moose,

48:50.297 --> 48:52.600
and their territories overlap.

48:52.634 --> 48:54.234
And they confronted each other
one day,

48:54.268 --> 48:56.303
and they started banging
heads, their thick skulls,

48:56.336 --> 48:58.907
boom, boom, over and over again.

48:58.939 --> 49:00.542
And then one of them hooked the
other's

49:00.575 --> 49:02.309
antlers and broke its neck.

49:03.477 --> 49:06.848
But now, it has to drag
that carcass around

49:07.816 --> 49:09.684
until it's exhausted and dies.

49:11.519 --> 49:12.687
- I don't get it.

49:13.822 --> 49:15.590
- People choose their burdens.

49:17.157 --> 49:19.928
And a person must choose
to put that burden down

49:19.960 --> 49:21.261
before they can be free.

49:24.998 --> 49:25.834
You get it?

49:27.635 --> 49:28.469
- Yeah.

49:30.772 --> 49:31.573
- Good.

50:31.866 --> 50:32.700
- Zoey.

50:37.639 --> 50:38.472
Zoey.

50:48.348 --> 50:50.183
Don't be afraid, Zoey.

50:53.521 --> 50:55.757
Open your eyes, sweetheart.

50:58.292 --> 51:00.528
How's my little girl doing?

51:04.164 --> 51:04.999
- Mom?

51:06.166 --> 51:08.268
- I need your help, Zoey.

51:11.338 --> 51:13.541
Would you be a dear and
tighten this for me?

51:23.618 --> 51:24.953
Don't be afraid.

51:27.354 --> 51:28.422
It's nothing.

51:30.024 --> 51:31.526
- I don't want to.

51:33.360 --> 51:35.195
- I need you to do it.

51:36.396 --> 51:37.197
- No!

51:37.230 --> 51:38.465
- Do it now!

51:51.311 --> 51:52.614
Atta girl.

52:06.728 --> 52:09.063
- Zoey, what's wrong?

52:11.065 --> 52:13.534
- My mom was here, and then it
took her!

52:13.568 --> 52:14.535
- Who took her?

52:14.569 --> 52:16.604
- The monster from the woods.

52:59.312 --> 53:01.849
Can you check on my mom
tomorrow?

53:01.883 --> 53:02.950
I'm worried about her,

53:02.984 --> 53:05.153
and I wanna make sure she's
okay.

53:05.185 --> 53:06.219
- Sure.

53:09.557 --> 53:12.359
- Can you sleep on the chair
and watch over me tonight?

53:14.629 --> 53:15.462
- Of course.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.968
I won't let anything bad happen
to you.

53:22.670 --> 53:24.739
- I love you, Uncle Jack.

53:24.772 --> 53:26.507
- I love you too, Zoey.

54:38.579 --> 54:39.981
- What happened?

54:40.014 --> 54:41.182
- Steffi.

54:41.215 --> 54:42.150
- Is she okay?

54:46.386 --> 54:47.221
- She's dead.

54:49.289 --> 54:51.324
- I'm so sorry.

54:51.358 --> 54:53.961
- What am I gonna tell Zoey?
This isn't fair to her.

54:55.163 --> 54:57.532
- You have to be there for
her, whatever she needs.

54:57.565 --> 55:00.268
- She just lost her father.
I can't tell her right away.

55:01.736 --> 55:04.205
I mean, things just aren't
making sense lately.

55:05.405 --> 55:07.708
I just got Lucas' toxicology
report back.

55:09.944 --> 55:12.213
I thought he mighta had
drugs in his system.

55:12.246 --> 55:14.916
I didn't see anything on
here, except his medication.

55:14.949 --> 55:16.083
I wanna know if I'm missing
something.

55:16.117 --> 55:17.118
Please take a look.

55:18.052 --> 55:20.420
- Okay, um.

55:24.592 --> 55:25.626
I don't, I don't see anything.

55:25.660 --> 55:26.493
- What is this right here?

55:26.527 --> 55:28.796
Phage lytic enzymes.

55:31.032 --> 55:33.534
- I believe that he took his
life

55:33.568 --> 55:35.036
because of something deeper.

55:36.304 --> 55:38.072
- No, there's something else.

55:38.105 --> 55:42.076
This was in Lucas' room.

55:48.916 --> 55:49.984
- What am I looking at?

55:50.017 --> 55:53.254
- It's what I saw that
night. It's what attacked us.

55:53.287 --> 55:55.656
- And look, this is Lucas'
handwriting.

55:57.225 --> 55:59.060
It's the word he wrote in the
mirror

55:59.093 --> 56:00.761
before he took his life.

56:03.831 --> 56:05.199
What if this thing is Nix?

56:06.934 --> 56:08.870
- Do you know what nix means in
German?

56:11.339 --> 56:13.741
Nothing. It means nothing.

56:14.976 --> 56:17.144
- You were out there that night.

56:17.178 --> 56:19.580
That was no animal, okay.

56:20.413 --> 56:21.414
This isn't nothing.

56:22.683 --> 56:25.219
- Is this the rabbit hole
you really wanna go down?

56:27.588 --> 56:28.421
- Yes.

56:30.691 --> 56:32.492
- Because there's nothing here.

56:50.111 --> 56:50.978
- Hi, Uncle Jack.

56:52.813 --> 56:53.648
- Hey, Zo.

56:56.317 --> 56:57.585
- Did you check on my mom?

56:59.287 --> 57:00.487
- Yeah.

57:00.521 --> 57:01.689
- Is she okay?

57:04.325 --> 57:06.327
- You're gonna stay with us for
a while.

57:08.229 --> 57:09.830
- She doesn't wanna say goodbye?

57:11.599 --> 57:12.967
- You know how your mom is.

57:16.704 --> 57:17.538
- I know.

57:21.042 --> 57:22.543
I'm okay, Uncle Jack.

57:24.011 --> 57:25.780
I want my mom to feel better.

57:26.881 --> 57:30.483
Besides, I like it here best
anyway.

57:33.154 --> 57:34.655
- Let's get you to bed, kiddo.

57:35.957 --> 57:37.124
- Hugs.

57:37.158 --> 57:39.026
- Mm-hm, good night, Grandma.

57:39.060 --> 57:39.860
- I love you.

57:39.894 --> 57:41.729
- I love you too.

57:41.762 --> 57:42.563
Good night.

57:42.596 --> 57:43.564
- I'll see you up there.

57:43.597 --> 57:44.432
- Okay.

57:47.635 --> 57:50.037
- She finally did it, didn't
she?

57:58.746 --> 58:00.514
- Did you lock all
the doors and windows?

58:00.548 --> 58:03.284
- Yes, no one can get in.

58:03.317 --> 58:05.086
- Not the monster from the
woods?

58:05.119 --> 58:05.953
- No.

58:07.021 --> 58:09.290
- Not the monster in the closet?

58:09.323 --> 58:11.392
- Nope.

58:11.425 --> 58:13.794
- What about the one in the
cellar?

58:13.828 --> 58:14.962
- Not that one either.

58:15.997 --> 58:16.831
- Good.

58:18.432 --> 58:21.669
- I promise I won't let
any of them hurt you.

58:23.504 --> 58:24.338
- Promise?

58:26.474 --> 58:27.308
- Promise.

58:28.509 --> 58:29.910
Now get some sleep.

58:35.383 --> 58:36.484
Night, Zoey.

58:36.517 --> 58:37.618
- Good night.

59:03.244 --> 59:04.078
- Hello?

59:06.847 --> 59:07.681
Hello!

1:00:37.938 --> 1:00:40.674
- What are you doing, Uncle
Jack?

1:00:41.543 --> 1:00:42.676
- I'm proving to you that there
isn't

1:00:42.710 --> 1:00:44.311
anything buried in the basement.

1:00:45.614 --> 1:00:47.882
- Thought you already said there
wasn't.

1:00:47.915 --> 1:00:50.017
- I wanna make sure for you.

1:00:53.854 --> 1:00:54.688
- Mm.

1:01:51.712 --> 1:01:52.880
- Can I help?

1:01:58.587 --> 1:02:00.589
Who does that belong to?

1:02:01.623 --> 1:02:02.957
- It's my dad's.

1:02:04.858 --> 1:02:08.530
- Jack! What are you doing to my
floor?

1:02:08.563 --> 1:02:10.798
This is unacceptable!

1:02:10.831 --> 1:02:11.666
I, I ...

1:02:12.667 --> 1:02:13.501
- Okay, Mom.

1:02:14.703 --> 1:02:15.537
- Ugh.

1:02:16.671 --> 1:02:17.505
Ugh.

1:02:22.109 --> 1:02:22.943
- So?

1:02:24.679 --> 1:02:25.513
Open it.

1:02:40.629 --> 1:02:43.531
- It's all the stuff from my
childhood.

1:02:43.565 --> 1:02:44.999
My dad musta put it here.

1:02:54.743 --> 1:02:55.577
- What's that?

1:02:57.111 --> 1:02:58.479
- It's a videotape.

1:02:59.947 --> 1:03:01.415
- What does it do?

1:03:01.448 --> 1:03:02.751
- It plays movies.

1:03:02.783 --> 1:03:04.351
- So it's a phone?

1:03:05.654 --> 1:03:08.055
- It plays videos like your
phone.

1:03:08.088 --> 1:03:10.090
It's what we used when we were
your age.

1:03:12.694 --> 1:03:13.595
- So that's it.

1:03:14.828 --> 1:03:16.030
There's nothing in here.

1:03:19.099 --> 1:03:21.935
- Sometimes our imaginations run
wild.

1:03:23.304 --> 1:03:24.606
We could think of some
really great things,

1:03:24.639 --> 1:03:27.241
or we can conjure up
some really bad things.

1:03:28.242 --> 1:03:31.145
Sometimes, if you tell the
same story over and over again,

1:03:32.313 --> 1:03:33.814
it takes on a life of its own.

1:03:37.652 --> 1:03:38.485
- Like the Nix?

1:03:40.020 --> 1:03:41.955
- Where did you hear that?

1:03:41.989 --> 1:03:43.692
- I saw it on the mirror that
day.

1:03:45.059 --> 1:03:46.728
And I heard my dad talk about
it.

1:03:49.863 --> 1:03:51.733
He told me it was going to
destroy us.

1:03:52.801 --> 1:03:53.635
All of us.

1:04:08.817 --> 1:04:10.451
- What did you see?

1:04:10.484 --> 1:04:12.219
- It doesn't matter what I saw.

1:04:12.252 --> 1:04:13.722
The important part is that we're
letting

1:04:13.755 --> 1:04:17.191
our imagination get the best
of us and it's not healthy.

1:04:17.224 --> 1:04:18.392
- What if you're wrong?

1:04:21.195 --> 1:04:22.863
I think I have proof.

1:04:23.832 --> 1:04:26.801
I found one of my videotapes
buried in the basement.

1:04:28.202 --> 1:04:30.538
All the videotapes I made when I
was a kid

1:04:30.572 --> 1:04:32.741
are gone, except this one.

1:04:33.974 --> 1:04:36.745
We put our hands in the
cement when I was seven.

1:04:37.712 --> 1:04:39.913
I got my video camera when I was
10.

1:04:42.517 --> 1:04:44.719
Let's find out what's on there.

1:05:05.472 --> 1:05:08.275
- We want food! We want
food!

1:05:08.308 --> 1:05:11.546
- Okay, okay,
we hear you.

1:05:11.579 --> 1:05:12.680
- We want food!

1:05:12.714 --> 1:05:13.615
- Rich, how long till--

1:05:13.648 --> 1:05:17.752
- You marinate the ketchup with
the onions

1:05:17.786 --> 1:05:21.021
and just keep stirring it
around, okay.

1:05:22.022 --> 1:05:25.058
- Guys, guys, wait up.

1:05:25.092 --> 1:05:26.193
Tessa, smile!

1:05:48.248 --> 1:05:49.818
- Did you see that?

1:05:50.885 --> 1:05:52.319
You were dead.

1:05:52.352 --> 1:05:53.487
- Jack, that's not funny.

1:05:53.521 --> 1:05:55.355
- I'm not joking, see!

1:06:01.195 --> 1:06:02.029
Nothing's there.

1:06:03.030 --> 1:06:04.331
- I love you, Mom.

1:06:06.200 --> 1:06:08.670
- Is that Tessa? I hear
her voice.

1:06:08.703 --> 1:06:10.337
- No, Mom, Liz is here.

1:06:11.438 --> 1:06:12.807
- Hi, Mrs. Coyle.

1:06:12.841 --> 1:06:13.808
- Good night.

1:06:19.714 --> 1:06:22.917
- I don't know what to believe.
I don't know what's real.

1:06:22.951 --> 1:06:26.888
I don't know what to do with
my mom or how to help Zoey.

1:06:26.921 --> 1:06:29.389
I need to find the truth.

1:06:35.530 --> 1:06:37.732
- Stop, stop!

1:06:37.765 --> 1:06:40.467
Why are you doing this to
yourself?

1:06:40.502 --> 1:06:44.606
- There are answers on this
tape and out in the woods.

1:06:44.639 --> 1:06:48.543
Lucas knew what this thing
was! It took his life!

1:06:48.576 --> 1:06:51.813
- If something happens to you,
who's gonna watch after Zoey?

1:06:53.447 --> 1:06:55.650
- I have to go out there.

1:06:58.318 --> 1:06:59.821
- Careful. Please.

1:07:43.031 --> 1:07:46.199
- Hey, Jack, come and
find me!

1:07:48.770 --> 1:07:51.873
- Hey, Champ, you guys wanna
know what--

1:07:51.906 --> 1:07:52.740
- What?

1:07:57.444 --> 1:07:59.948
- Stay where you are.

1:07:59.981 --> 1:08:02.584
Don't come back. They're all
dead.

1:08:06.554 --> 1:08:09.824
- The secret ingredient
is sharp cheddar cheese.

1:08:09.857 --> 1:08:13.260
And then you put it on an
English muffin--

1:08:17.397 --> 1:08:18.398
- Dad.
- Dad.

1:08:23.705 --> 1:08:24.872
- Someone's watching us.

1:08:29.844 --> 1:08:30.979
- Hello?

1:08:35.449 --> 1:08:37.919
What are you doing over there?

1:08:41.221 --> 1:08:44.525
Mister, are you lost?

1:08:45.827 --> 1:08:46.894
- Yeah, sorry.

1:08:46.928 --> 1:08:49.363
Can you point me in the
direction of the main road?

1:08:50.497 --> 1:08:52.499
- Yeah, sure. It's right over
there.

1:08:55.703 --> 1:08:56.638
- You guys camping?

1:08:58.438 --> 1:08:59.941
- Yeah.

1:08:59.974 --> 1:09:01.976
Just grilling up some burgers
right now.

1:09:02.944 --> 1:09:05.880
Sharp cheddar cheese is
the secret ingredient.

1:09:05.913 --> 1:09:08.616
And you put it all on an
English muffin instead of a bun.

1:09:10.885 --> 1:09:11.886
- You're a good man.

1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:14.522
I see you have a nice family.

1:09:15.790 --> 1:09:17.992
You should enjoy your time with
them.

1:09:18.026 --> 1:09:20.061
- They're actually
pretty rowdy.

1:09:22.964 --> 1:09:23.798
But I love them.

1:09:26.768 --> 1:09:29.302
How about you? Got any kids?

1:09:31.906 --> 1:09:32.740
- No.

1:09:32.774 --> 1:09:35.242
Well, uh, one, sort of.

1:09:36.476 --> 1:09:37.812
- Hm.

1:09:37.845 --> 1:09:40.848
Well, you take good care of her.

1:09:42.984 --> 1:09:43.885
I better get back.

1:09:46.219 --> 1:09:47.287
Safe travels, Champ.

1:09:49.991 --> 1:09:51.125
- Bye, Dad.

1:09:52.994 --> 1:09:54.294
Love you.

1:09:58.700 --> 1:09:59.901
- Who was that?

1:09:59.934 --> 1:10:02.904
- Just someone who was lost.
Nothing to worry about.

1:10:07.441 --> 1:10:08.275
- Dad!

1:10:09.544 --> 1:10:11.012
Dad!

1:10:11.045 --> 1:10:13.948
Tessa is going into the pond!
Help her!

1:10:13.981 --> 1:10:18.986
- Save her, Dad, help her!
- Dad, save her!

1:10:20.320 --> 1:10:21.155
- Tessa!

1:10:30.464 --> 1:10:31.298
Tessa!

1:10:37.872 --> 1:10:38.706
No.

1:10:40.474 --> 1:10:41.374
Tessa!

1:11:21.582 --> 1:11:22.817
- I saw it.

1:11:22.850 --> 1:11:24.185
I saw all of it.

1:11:26.621 --> 1:11:28.689
- Did you find what you were
looking for?

1:11:31.692 --> 1:11:33.694
But did you talk to the old
woman first?

1:11:38.833 --> 1:11:40.935
Then it's not inside you yet.

1:11:44.337 --> 1:11:46.240
You need to go talk to her.

1:11:56.751 --> 1:11:58.619
- Would you like some hot cocoa

1:12:01.022 --> 1:12:02.557
und some marshmallows?

1:12:03.524 --> 1:12:04.457
- Why am I here?

1:12:07.028 --> 1:12:07.862
Who are you?

1:12:11.732 --> 1:12:12.834
- I explain.

1:12:14.467 --> 1:12:15.303
My life

1:12:16.604 --> 1:12:17.437
pain,

1:12:19.140 --> 1:12:22.243
come from Fatherland, old
country.

1:12:24.477 --> 1:12:26.113
Brought Nix here to drown.

1:12:27.715 --> 1:12:29.617
Keep it from ones I love.

1:12:30.918 --> 1:12:32.587
But it found you.

1:12:33.788 --> 1:12:35.289
Your family.

1:12:36.423 --> 1:12:39.060
Your pain now.

1:12:39.093 --> 1:12:40.161
- You're not real.

1:12:41.461 --> 1:12:43.231
- You don't see.

1:12:43.264 --> 1:12:45.333
Only darkness.

1:12:45.365 --> 1:12:48.903
In order to see, you first
have to open your eyes.

1:12:53.440 --> 1:12:54.441
- Hey, Jack.

1:12:56.911 --> 1:12:58.112
- Lucas?

1:12:58.145 --> 1:13:01.349
- I wanna show you something.

1:13:01.381 --> 1:13:05.219
Come on. Tessa and I are
gonna hit some high pops.

1:13:11.525 --> 1:13:13.327
It's okay, Jack. Come in.

1:13:55.236 --> 1:13:56.237
- Save Zoey.

1:14:06.013 --> 1:14:07.114
- Who are you?

1:14:10.518 --> 1:14:13.554
You've taken everything from us!

1:14:21.494 --> 1:14:23.164
- I don't understand.

1:14:25.099 --> 1:14:26.200
What else do you want?

1:14:29.136 --> 1:14:31.672
- Tessa, are you awake?

1:14:32.974 --> 1:14:34.542
Hm.

1:14:34.575 --> 1:14:35.409
Oh.

1:14:36.811 --> 1:14:39.847
We're gonna go camping tomorrow.

1:14:39.880 --> 1:14:41.682
Have fun just like the old days.

1:14:44.218 --> 1:14:48.189
Oh.

1:14:48.222 --> 1:14:51.459
I love you so much, my little
princess.

1:15:04.005 --> 1:15:04.939
- Tessa!

1:15:10.077 --> 1:15:10.911
Tessa!

1:15:12.079 --> 1:15:12.880
Tessa!

1:15:16.017 --> 1:15:16.851
Richard!

1:15:18.085 --> 1:15:18.919
Tessa!

1:15:20.421 --> 1:15:21.489
Richard!

1:15:31.432 --> 1:15:33.367
Why didn't you help her?

1:15:33.401 --> 1:15:35.636
- I couldn't find her, honey!

1:15:37.571 --> 1:15:38.906
She's not there!

1:15:42.676 --> 1:15:44.211
- Richard.

1:16:07.768 --> 1:16:08.602
Richard.

1:16:10.671 --> 1:16:13.007
- I'm sorry. I tried to save
her.

1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:15.676
- You didn't try hard enough.

1:16:15.709 --> 1:16:18.012
- I looked and I looked and I--

1:16:18.045 --> 1:16:19.847
- Shut up, Richard!

1:16:19.880 --> 1:16:23.684
This is your fault. She's
dead because of you.

1:16:26.454 --> 1:16:29.123
You were supposed to be watching
her!

1:16:36.565 --> 1:16:39.266
- Get off of him! You're gonna
kill him!

1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:41.669
What the fuck are you doing?

1:16:41.702 --> 1:16:42.537
Stop!

1:17:18.339 --> 1:17:19.173
- Donna?

1:17:22.176 --> 1:17:23.010
Donna?

1:17:26.747 --> 1:17:28.249
Donna, are you home?

1:17:30.184 --> 1:17:31.652
Oh for God sake.

1:17:32.987 --> 1:17:34.355
Donna, come on!

1:17:36.090 --> 1:17:37.458
- How'd you get in here?

1:17:39.493 --> 1:17:41.295
- You left the front door wide
open.

1:17:42.363 --> 1:17:44.131
You can't be doing stuff like
that.

1:17:45.567 --> 1:17:49.236
- I'm so sorry.
I'll never do that again.

1:17:52.907 --> 1:17:54.074
- Jack came to see me.

1:17:55.409 --> 1:17:56.944
- Well that's unfortunate.

1:17:58.212 --> 1:17:59.813
- He's worried about you, Donna.

1:18:00.781 --> 1:18:05.786
- Everybody's worried about
me, and it's pretty annoying.

1:18:08.489 --> 1:18:11.091
Just leave me alone.

1:18:12.726 --> 1:18:14.094
- We're trying to help you.

1:18:16.030 --> 1:18:17.532
You've gotta get off the meds.

1:18:18.533 --> 1:18:20.768
All those pills, you
know that's not healthy.

1:18:21.735 --> 1:18:24.506
- What should I be on, Doctor?

1:18:28.142 --> 1:18:30.844
Oh, oh, wait, I forgot.

1:18:30.878 --> 1:18:33.080
I'm supposed to be positive,
aren't I?

1:18:37.151 --> 1:18:39.654
Because everything's just peachy
keen.

1:18:40.555 --> 1:18:43.592
- You know, I loved
Lucas like he was my own.

1:18:43.625 --> 1:18:44.992
- Well he wasn't.

1:18:46.026 --> 1:18:46.860
You

1:18:48.028 --> 1:18:49.463
don't have a clue

1:18:50.464 --> 1:18:53.434
about what it's like to lose a
child.

1:18:53.467 --> 1:18:54.835
- I do know, Donna.

1:18:55.869 --> 1:18:57.805
Because I buried Lucas too.

1:18:57.838 --> 1:18:59.006
- Ha!

1:18:59.039 --> 1:19:01.108
- But who do I bury next?

1:19:01.141 --> 1:19:05.012
You or Jack, or maybe Zoey?

1:19:05.045 --> 1:19:06.013
- Oh.

1:19:10.017 --> 1:19:12.654
- Just, get outta my house.

1:19:15.823 --> 1:19:17.358
Now!

1:20:40.307 --> 1:20:41.141

- Don't be so dramatic.

1:21:25.886 --> 1:21:28.188
Be polite. Say hello to your
sister.

1:21:52.479 --> 1:21:54.549
It left me in the woods.

1:22:04.626 --> 1:22:07.494
You'll feel different when it's
in you.

1:22:23.912 --> 1:22:25.279
It doesn't want you.

1:22:27.549 --> 1:22:29.517
Maybe you're dying like me.

1:22:30.451 --> 1:22:33.287
- No more lies. No more tricks.

1:22:34.321 --> 1:22:37.090
I saw what you did to Dad.

1:22:39.426 --> 1:22:40.829
Say what happened out there.

1:22:42.564 --> 1:22:43.898
- I'm sick, Jack.

1:22:46.734 --> 1:22:50.370
I've been sick for a very long
time.

1:22:53.508 --> 1:22:56.977
That's the one good purpose it
served.

1:22:59.547 --> 1:23:01.583
It kept me alive.

1:23:08.989 --> 1:23:09.990
- Where is it going?

1:23:12.594 --> 1:23:14.929

1:23:21.936 --> 1:23:23.270
There's only one left.

1:23:25.138 --> 1:23:26.674
And she's upstairs.

1:23:31.411 --> 1:23:35.115
No! You stay with me, Jack!

1:23:35.148 --> 1:23:37.050
You stay with me!

1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:40.053
Mother needs you.

1:23:56.436 --> 1:23:58.272
- Get away from her! What are
you doing?

1:23:58.305 --> 1:24:00.008
Where is she?

1:24:06.079 --> 1:24:07.515

- I know she's here. She's
hiding.

1:24:25.232 --> 1:24:28.036
Come on out, Tessa.

1:24:31.806 --> 1:24:33.273
Don't be afraid.

1:24:34.943 --> 1:24:39.948
- Jack, I missed you!

1:24:41.248 --> 1:24:42.984
I love you, Jack.

1:24:43.017 --> 1:24:43.851
- Ah!

1:24:47.622 --> 1:24:48.523
Oh, ah, ah!

1:25:02.202 --> 1:25:03.370
- Mom?

1:25:06.975 --> 1:25:08.308
You can't have her.

1:25:09.343 --> 1:25:11.345
Neither can the Nix.

1:25:12.780 --> 1:25:15.683
This thing has been inside of
you,

1:25:15.717 --> 1:25:16.884
feeding off of you.

1:25:18.185 --> 1:25:21.823
It needs you just as much as you
need it.

1:25:23.123 --> 1:25:24.592
Open your eyes, Mom!

1:25:25.860 --> 1:25:27.095
Open them!

1:25:31.065 --> 1:25:31.899
- I ...

1:25:33.467 --> 1:25:37.270
I didn't want to hurt you or
Lucas.

1:25:37.304 --> 1:25:38.606
I'm sorry, Jack.

1:25:40.173 --> 1:25:41.009
I ...

1:25:42.677 --> 1:25:43.511
Oh.

1:25:44.545 --> 1:25:45.379
I wish ...

1:25:46.614 --> 1:25:50.118
I could have been a better
mother for you.

1:25:51.418 --> 1:25:52.252
- I needed you.

1:25:53.220 --> 1:25:54.656
I needed a mother.

1:25:54.689 --> 1:25:56.991
- Stop staring at me!

1:25:58.291 --> 1:26:02.997
Stop judging me! Stop
treating me like a monster!

1:26:04.832 --> 1:26:08.468
Get away from me! You're not my
son.

1:26:09.937 --> 1:26:10.972
You're nothing!

1:26:13.473 --> 1:26:14.307
Oh.

1:26:42.003 --> 1:26:42.837
I ...

1:26:48.810 --> 1:26:50.477
Take me to the pond.

1:26:52.013 --> 1:26:53.681
It's where I belong.

1:26:54.816 --> 1:26:56.551
It's where it belongs.

1:27:00.220 --> 1:27:05.093
I don't think it's gonna
stay in me for very long.

1:27:06.961 --> 1:27:11.799
And if it escapes, it's just
going to find someone else.

1:27:15.235 --> 1:27:16.571
- You need help.

1:27:18.873 --> 1:27:20.407
- It's too late for me.

1:27:22.409 --> 1:27:25.947
But it's not too late for you
and Zoey.

1:27:25.980 --> 1:27:26.981
- Mom.

1:27:27.014 --> 1:27:31.619
- Please, I have to be
with Tessa one last time.

1:27:35.790 --> 1:27:37.357
I know Tessa died there.

1:27:39.560 --> 1:27:40.695
I know that now.

1:27:48.102 --> 1:27:50.270
- But I'm still here, Mom.

1:27:52.673 --> 1:27:55.943
- Which is why this is our only
choice.

1:27:59.147 --> 1:27:59.981
Please.

1:29:10.117 --> 1:29:13.521
- I could never be the mother
you wanted.

1:29:16.257 --> 1:29:19.359
But you were always the son I
needed.

1:29:21.729 --> 1:29:22.763
I love you.

1:29:32.372 --> 1:29:33.406
I'm ready.

1:30:04.639 --> 1:30:08.209
Oh, you look beautiful,
my little princess.

1:30:10.378 --> 1:30:11.746
- I love you, Mom.

1:30:11.779 --> 1:30:14.382
- Aw. I love you too, my Tessa.

1:30:57.058 --> 1:30:58.993
- Well those are two easy.

1:30:59.026 --> 1:31:01.028
How about that one?

1:31:02.229 --> 1:31:03.164
- Elk.

1:31:03.197 --> 1:31:04.031
- Okay, okay. Okay.

1:31:05.199 --> 1:31:08.135
- Okay that one, behind you.
- I'm ready.

1:31:08.970 --> 1:31:11.872
- Uh, deer.

1:31:13.407 --> 1:31:15.076
- It's a cari-boo!

1:31:16.110 --> 1:31:18.012
You got it wrong. You
did not pass the test.

1:31:18.045 --> 1:31:18.846
- I did.

1:31:18.879 --> 1:31:19.747
I did. I got it wrong.

1:31:21.215 --> 1:31:24.852
I'm gonna go talk to your
uncle for a second. You okay?

1:31:24.885 --> 1:31:25.653
- Yeah.

1:31:25.686 --> 1:31:26.721
- All right.

1:31:42.970 --> 1:31:45.873
- I wanna thank you for
everything.

1:31:47.274 --> 1:31:49.944
I appreciate you taking
care of Zoey last night.

1:31:49.977 --> 1:31:51.045
- Of course.

1:31:57.118 --> 1:31:59.053
She needed to be out of that
house.

1:32:01.922 --> 1:32:04.392
- I'm sorry, for everything
I've put you through.

1:32:05.993 --> 1:32:07.194
- I'm just ...

1:32:09.296 --> 1:32:11.198
I'm just glad you're okay.

1:32:13.100 --> 1:32:15.236
- I haven't been acting
like myself lately.

1:32:21.709 --> 1:32:25.679
- So, did you find what
you were looking for?

1:32:27.982 --> 1:32:28.816
- Honestly ...

1:32:32.987 --> 1:32:34.588
- Come here.

1:32:37.091 --> 1:32:38.025
- Come on.

1:32:40.861 --> 1:32:41.695
- Hey.

1:32:42.563 --> 1:32:44.165
Uncle Jack, you're here!

1:32:49.770 --> 1:32:50.838
I missed you.

1:32:52.973 --> 1:32:55.776
Are you hungry? You can have my
pancakes.

1:32:55.810 --> 1:32:57.211
- Thank you, Zoey.

1:33:01.315 --> 1:33:05.152
- Wow, so, I guess this is
goodbye.

1:33:08.856 --> 1:33:10.591
- I guess so.

1:33:10.624 --> 1:33:12.493
- Why can't we just go with Liz?

1:33:14.695 --> 1:33:17.566
- Sweetie, you guys can come and
visit me

1:33:17.598 --> 1:33:18.699
anytime that you want.

1:33:21.302 --> 1:33:23.505
- I have something to tell you.

1:33:23.538 --> 1:33:24.371
- What?

1:33:28.209 --> 1:33:29.043
- I lied.

1:33:29.944 --> 1:33:30.911
- About what?

1:33:35.649 --> 1:33:37.818
- I wasn't ready to say goodbye
to my dad.

1:33:44.458 --> 1:33:45.359
- It's okay, Zoey.

1:33:49.930 --> 1:33:50.798
- You're not mad?

1:33:52.900 --> 1:33:53.734
- No.

1:33:56.137 --> 1:33:58.372
When you're ready to say
goodbye, you'll know.

1:34:03.844 --> 1:34:07.148
- Yeah.

1:34:07.181 --> 1:34:09.817
- Why don't we go with Liz to
her place?

1:34:09.850 --> 1:34:12.353
Stay there for a while, see how
it goes?

1:34:13.522 --> 1:34:14.355
- Really?

1:34:17.391 --> 1:34:18.225
- Really.

1:34:22.263 --> 1:34:23.565
- I would love that.

1:34:25.266 --> 1:34:27.101
- Would you like that?

1:34:30.304 --> 1:34:31.372
- Guess what?

1:34:31.405 --> 1:34:32.339
- What?

1:34:32.373 --> 1:34:34.909
- Liz thought that that animal
right there

1:34:34.942 --> 1:34:38.012
was a deer, but it is a caribou.

1:34:38.045 --> 1:34:39.313
- A caribou?

1:34:39.346 --> 1:34:41.482
- A caribou.

1:34:41.516 --> 1:34:42.349
- Obviously.

1:34:43.250 --> 1:34:44.952
- It was obvious. I was wrong.

1:34:44.985 --> 1:34:46.287
What am I gonna do?

1:34:47.855 --> 1:34:51.959
You want some coffee or
something? Wanna check it out?

1:34:51.992 --> 1:34:54.161
- Can I get ice cream?

1:34:54.195 --> 1:34:57.464
- You know, I think
that we can manage that.
