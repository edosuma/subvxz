00:14.267 --> 00:15.699
I need you to do

00:22.774 --> 00:24.074
The ambassador's husband,

00:24.142 --> 00:25.643
he's working against you.

00:27.145 --> 00:28.779
Take Mr. Boyd to

00:28.846 --> 00:30.681
Hold him there.

No phone calls, no visitors,

03:51.298 --> 03:52.999
Ambushing Saul's convoy
may have been a diversion

03:53.067 --> 03:54.768
to draw the Marines
away from here.

03:54.835 --> 03:55.769
Draw them away?

03:55.836 --> 03:57.503
From the embassy.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.106
The ISI know about the tunnel
under the Economics section.

04:00.174 --> 04:02.141
- What?! - Which means
anybody could know by now.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.475
Which means we are

04:03.543 --> 04:05.243
Private, give me your comms.

04:05.311 --> 04:07.412
- Sir. - How many Marines were
deployed to the ambush site?

04:07.480 --> 04:08.947
It's pretty much everyone
on the duty roster,

04:09.015 --> 04:10.849
except us two and a couple
of men posted at the gate.

04:10.917 --> 04:12.785
- Marine Dispatch, this is Peter Quinn.
DISPATCHER: - Marine Dispatch.

04:12.852 --> 04:14.352
Get me the CO who deployed
to the ambush site.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.254
Ambassador, you need
to get to the vault,

04:16.322 --> 04:17.923
follow lockdown two protocols

QUINN: - Thank God.

04:34.639 --> 04:36.573
Captain, I need your men
back with us here.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.675
We have intel of a possible
attack on the embassy.

04:38.743 --> 04:40.077
When?

04:40.144 --> 04:42.179
Now. It may be tied
to your being off-site.

04:42.246 --> 04:43.479
Copy that, on our way.

04:43.547 --> 04:45.949

05:09.706 --> 05:11.305

05:11.373 --> 05:12.506
Where are you?

05:12.574 --> 05:14.675
- (gunshot)
- Tell me where you are.

05:14.744 --> 05:18.412
Four blocks north
of the embassy on Nursa Road!

05:18.480 --> 05:19.347
How many gunmen?

05:19.414 --> 05:20.448
Four, five at least.

05:20.515 --> 05:22.016
We're taking casualties!
Hurry!

05:22.084 --> 05:23.017
I'll send a section.

05:23.085 --> 05:24.452
Send a platoon!

05:24.519 --> 05:28.122
All right, sit tight,
we're on our way.

05:33.094 --> 05:34.561
What are you doing?

05:34.629 --> 05:36.296
It can wait.

05:36.364 --> 05:37.898
They're being overrun now.

05:37.966 --> 05:39.566
Ten minutes.

05:39.634 --> 05:41.168
Then you can make the call.

05:44.138 --> 05:46.172
The Americans have
insinuated themselves

05:46.240 --> 05:47.974
long enough into our business.

05:48.041 --> 05:50.977
It's time they get a dose
of their own medicine.

05:54.982 --> 05:57.850
Haqqani.

05:57.918 --> 06:00.219
He's part of this, too,
isn't he?

06:02.121 --> 06:04.322
He is a terrorist.

06:04.390 --> 06:07.425
No, he's killed dozens of
my soldiers on the border.

06:07.493 --> 06:10.929
Only because you keep working
with the Americans.

06:10.997 --> 06:13.031
Once they're gone, you won't
have to worry about Haqqani.

06:13.099 --> 06:14.732
Are you really so naive?

06:14.801 --> 06:15.967
Me?

06:16.035 --> 06:17.302
I'm not the one
who keeps insisting

06:17.369 --> 06:19.670
the enemy is our friend.

06:23.608 --> 06:27.211
We wait ten minutes...

06:27.279 --> 06:28.913
then we call.

06:30.982 --> 06:33.417
QUINN: I'm checking the tunnel
now until the Marines get back.

06:33.484 --> 06:34.818
How solid is the intel?

06:34.885 --> 06:36.319
Solid enough to
start lockdown two.

06:36.386 --> 06:38.087
All right.

06:38.155 --> 06:39.388
Where's Martha now?

06:39.456 --> 06:40.924
In the vault with her husband.

06:40.991 --> 06:43.860
Give us a status report
when you're down there.

06:43.928 --> 06:47.130
Are you familiar with level
two lockdown procedure?

06:47.198 --> 06:48.298
More or less.

06:48.365 --> 06:49.899
Then I'll let you
brief the group.

06:51.835 --> 06:53.768
Everyone, listen up.

06:53.837 --> 06:56.705
We have a possible breach.

06:56.772 --> 06:58.473

documents and ciphers

06:58.541 --> 07:00.775

Sandy Bachman spent three
years building that network.

07:29.770 --> 07:31.771
There must be
an off-site backup.

07:31.839 --> 07:33.406
Sandy didn't trust DC.

07:33.474 --> 07:35.641

to do with it?

07:37.611 --> 07:38.711
You and me,

07:38.779 --> 07:40.380
we're gonna get
it to the vault.

12:57.345 --> 12:58.745
It makes no sense.

12:58.813 --> 13:00.648
We don't even know
it's Haqqani.

13:00.715 --> 13:03.250
And if it is, we can't
assume he's a rational actor.

13:03.318 --> 13:05.018
This isn't his endgame.

13:05.086 --> 13:06.786
We'll sort it out later.

13:06.853 --> 13:07.853
Movement on the side.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.021
Third level down.

13:09.923 --> 13:11.357
Far-right pillar.

13:11.425 --> 13:12.992
You got a target.

13:13.060 --> 13:14.026
Fuck.

13:14.094 --> 13:15.528
He's setting up, Carrie.

13:15.596 --> 13:16.462
See him?

13:16.530 --> 13:17.463
Yeah.

13:17.531 --> 13:20.533
Easy now.

13:20.601 --> 13:24.102
(gunfire)

13:24.170 --> 13:26.572
Carrie. Carrie,
what are you doing?!

13:26.639 --> 13:27.606
I'm trying to kill
the motherfucker

13:27.674 --> 13:28.807
who's trying to kill us!

13:28.874 --> 13:30.775
What do you think I'm doing?!

13:33.079 --> 13:35.013
Khan's garrison is
six klicks from here.

13:35.081 --> 13:38.450
Those soldiers should
be here by now.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.085
MARTHA: I'm in the vault
with CIA Director Lockhart.

13:41.152 --> 13:43.354
He was at the station
when it was overrun.

13:43.422 --> 13:44.822
Yes, we're
under attack--

13:44.889 --> 13:46.524
what the hell do you
think I've been saying?!

13:46.592 --> 13:49.159
We have heavily-armed
fighters inside the compound.

13:49.228 --> 13:52.263
Gunfire, casualties-- we
need your immediate help!

13:52.331 --> 13:53.497
Let me talk to him.

13:53.565 --> 13:55.266
How about one of those
AC-130 gunships

13:55.334 --> 13:56.900
we delivered to you last month.

13:57.935 --> 13:59.436
Goddamn it, General.

13:59.503 --> 14:01.003
This is your country.

14:01.071 --> 14:03.940
The safety of this embassy
is your responsibility.

14:06.677 --> 14:08.745
I don't care what
you have to do;

14:08.812 --> 14:10.614
just get them here!

14:10.681 --> 14:13.015
- What is the number for the prime
minister's chief of staff? - Martha.

14:14.784 --> 14:17.686
MAN: Get on
your knees, knees.

14:23.126 --> 14:25.461
Open the door.

14:43.145 --> 14:45.212
We know you're in there.

14:56.824 --> 14:57.724
(quiet groaning)

14:57.792 --> 14:59.125
Shh, shh.

14:59.193 --> 15:01.295
I said open the door.

15:08.234 --> 15:10.569
This is Ambassador Martha Boyd.

15:10.637 --> 15:13.506
You are in violation
of international law.

15:13.573 --> 15:15.274
Open the door.

15:15.342 --> 15:17.943
The Pakistan Armed Forces
are on their way.

15:18.011 --> 15:19.845
You will all be killed.

15:19.913 --> 15:22.080
I will ask you
one more time only.

15:25.351 --> 15:26.584
MARTHA:
I can't do it.

15:26.652 --> 15:28.219
I'm under strict protocol.

15:28.287 --> 15:30.522
The door won't open
until I get an all-clear

15:30.589 --> 15:33.591
from the Diplomatic Security
Command Center in Washington.

15:33.659 --> 15:35.293
Send out Mr. Lockhart.

15:35.361 --> 15:36.928
(gasps softly)

15:36.995 --> 15:38.496
He's not here.

15:38.564 --> 15:40.130
Don't lie to me.

15:40.198 --> 15:41.398
I'm not.

15:44.302 --> 15:47.604
He has materials in his
possession, a certain list.

15:47.672 --> 15:49.840
That's all I want.

15:49.907 --> 15:53.109
Give it to me,
and no one else dies.

15:54.245 --> 15:56.279
I told you, I can't do it.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.514
Jesus fucking Christ.

15:58.582 --> 15:59.749
You can execute them all,

15:59.817 --> 16:01.851
there's not a damn thing
I can do.

16:11.228 --> 16:12.962
No, no, no, take me, take me!

16:15.498 --> 16:17.599
(whimpering)

16:19.635 --> 16:22.771
Give me the list, or I will
kill her right here, right now.

16:24.507 --> 16:25.574
Stop. Stop.

16:25.641 --> 16:26.641
I'm coming out.

16:26.709 --> 16:28.009
The hell are you doing?

16:28.077 --> 16:29.678
What does it look like?

16:29.746 --> 16:31.178
I'm giving him what he wants.

16:31.246 --> 16:32.980
Are you fucking kidding me?

16:33.047 --> 16:35.115
Open that door,
and we're all dead.

16:35.183 --> 16:36.817
Including the assets
on that list.

16:36.885 --> 16:38.118
You don't know that.

16:38.186 --> 16:40.454
I can damn well guess.

16:40.522 --> 16:42.956
You have ten seconds,
Mr. Lockhart.

16:43.024 --> 16:46.226
He's gonna cut her head
off, for Christ's sake.

16:46.294 --> 16:48.327
It's a war, Andrew.

16:48.396 --> 16:50.296
Well, I can't just
stand here and watch.

16:50.364 --> 16:51.297
Now, move aside.

16:51.365 --> 16:52.832
I won't.

16:54.101 --> 16:56.369
Back the fuck off!

17:01.141 --> 17:03.075
What is this?

17:03.143 --> 17:06.144
It's on a countdown, asshole.

17:06.212 --> 17:07.512
Don't hurt her.

17:07.579 --> 17:09.515
You hear me? I'm coming out.

17:09.582 --> 17:11.383
Open the door.

17:11.451 --> 17:13.652
There's a timer,
it's on a countdown.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.921
49 seconds, 48...

17:17.089 --> 17:18.957
HAQQANI:
No games, Mr. Lockhart.

17:19.025 --> 17:20.291
No, no!

17:20.358 --> 17:21.726
No games.

17:21.794 --> 17:23.227
You have my word.

17:29.968 --> 17:31.502
(whispering):
What's going on?

17:31.570 --> 17:33.504
They're at the
door to the vault.

17:33.572 --> 17:35.005
Three hostages are down.

17:35.073 --> 17:37.374
Haqqani has a knife
to the throat of the...

17:38.709 --> 17:40.076
...throat of the fourth.

17:40.144 --> 17:42.979
What do we do?

17:43.047 --> 17:44.981
They got this place
mapped out, right?

17:45.049 --> 17:46.750
They knew about the
tunnels and the vault.

17:46.818 --> 17:48.318
Right.

17:48.385 --> 17:49.686
That means they know about
the emergency stairwell

17:49.754 --> 17:52.456
at the back of the
ambassador's office.

17:52.523 --> 17:53.690
What are you thinking?

17:53.758 --> 17:55.258
I say we chase them
toward the exit.

17:55.326 --> 17:56.959
There's only two of us.

17:57.026 --> 17:59.361
This is a surgical strike,
it's not a suicide mission.

17:59.429 --> 18:02.364
They'd rather run than
engage in firefight.

18:02.432 --> 18:03.532
You sure?

18:03.600 --> 18:05.634
No.

18:10.173 --> 18:12.207
(beeping, lock clicks)

18:22.417 --> 18:23.518
(lock clicks)

18:23.586 --> 18:25.252
Shit.

18:26.254 --> 18:28.122
Give it to him.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.457
LOCKHART:
There.

18:30.525 --> 18:33.293
Now let her go.

18:38.099 --> 18:39.132
(speaking native language)

18:39.200 --> 18:40.968
Oh, no, no.

18:41.035 --> 18:42.068
No. No.

18:42.136 --> 18:43.570
HAQQANI:
Kill them all.

18:48.675 --> 18:50.810
(men shouting)

19:17.369 --> 19:19.103
PRIVATE:
It's clear, sir!

19:38.422 --> 19:40.523
(speaking native language)

19:53.604 --> 19:54.870
(explosion)

19:56.606 --> 19:58.707
(fire alarm ringing)

20:11.287 --> 20:12.853
(ringing continues)

20:12.921 --> 20:15.022
Fuck!

20:18.460 --> 20:20.695
♪

20:52.058 --> 20:53.726
(horn honking)

21:00.333 --> 21:01.667
Backup's here.

21:18.383 --> 21:21.284
(horn honking)

21:26.524 --> 21:28.625
(honking continues)

21:42.072 --> 21:44.506
My God.

21:49.532 --> 21:52.860
_

22:03.861 --> 22:07.462
_

22:08.597 --> 22:11.498
Grim details continue
to emerge from Islamabad,

22:11.566 --> 22:14.134
where the US embassy was
attacked earlier today.

22:14.202 --> 22:16.737
In scenes reminiscent
of Benghazi, Libya,

22:16.805 --> 22:18.739
gunmen overran
parts of the compound,

22:18.807 --> 22:21.374
leaving as many
as 40 Americans dead.

22:21.442 --> 22:22.943
According to the Taliban,

22:23.011 --> 22:25.012
the attack was in retaliation
for drone strikes

22:25.080 --> 22:27.014
in the northwest part
of the country.

22:27.082 --> 22:30.316
Meanwhile, the Pakistani Army
has sealed off the area

22:30.383 --> 22:32.284
immediately surrounding
the embassy

22:32.352 --> 22:34.220
and will provide security
at the site

22:34.287 --> 22:36.889
until order in the capital
is restored.

22:36.957 --> 22:38.290
Although the attack is believed

22:38.358 --> 22:40.492
- to be an isolated incident...
- (phone ringing)

22:40.560 --> 22:42.061
...security measures at...

22:42.129 --> 22:44.363
(turns off TV)

22:44.431 --> 22:48.066
You want to take
it or should I?

22:49.035 --> 22:51.669
All yours.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.879
Hello?

23:01.947 --> 23:04.215
Yes, I'll hold.

23:20.264 --> 23:22.331
You were mean.

23:24.701 --> 23:27.771
All she wanted was
your approval,

23:27.838 --> 23:30.539
and all you gave her
was a hard time.

23:34.678 --> 23:37.045
I was training her, Max.

23:37.113 --> 23:40.282
You could've said
something nice.

23:40.349 --> 23:42.517
Just once.

23:42.585 --> 23:45.287
Would've meant so much.

23:49.793 --> 23:52.294
I wish I had.

23:52.361 --> 23:54.461
Just a few words is all.

23:57.766 --> 24:01.169
Because she was
really doing okay.

24:01.236 --> 24:03.337
More than okay.

24:06.675 --> 24:09.343
LOCKHART:
Carrie?

24:09.411 --> 24:10.677
I need a moment.

24:23.657 --> 24:24.958
I just got off with
the White House.

24:25.026 --> 24:26.059
And?

24:26.127 --> 24:27.860
We're getting out of Pakistan.

24:27.928 --> 24:30.863
The president's decided to
break off diplomatic relations.

24:30.931 --> 24:33.199
I can't say I'm surprised.

24:33.266 --> 24:35.100
The attack was clearly
state-sponsored.

24:35.168 --> 24:37.102
They've got blood
on their hands.

24:37.170 --> 24:38.403
Glad you feel that way.

24:38.471 --> 24:39.972
Because we're being evacuated

24:40.040 --> 24:42.007
in the first wave
tomorrow morning.

24:42.075 --> 24:44.442
Not me. I'm staying behind.

24:44.509 --> 24:45.810
I don't think so.

24:45.878 --> 24:47.245
At least until we get
as many of our assets

24:47.313 --> 24:48.313
out of harm's way as possible.

24:48.380 --> 24:49.613
- Carrie...
- Haqqani will hunt

24:49.681 --> 24:51.916
- them down one by one.
- Listen to me.

24:51.984 --> 24:54.452
The president isn't comfortable

24:54.519 --> 24:57.588
with you representing our
interests here any longer.

24:57.656 --> 24:58.823
In any capacity.

24:58.891 --> 25:00.591
From now on, all
covert operations

25:00.659 --> 25:02.960
will be run out
of Kabul Station.

25:07.698 --> 25:10.700
It's my fault.

25:10.768 --> 25:13.436
I never should've
given over that list.

25:16.474 --> 25:19.508
It was a tough call.

25:19.576 --> 25:22.845
I'm not sure
what I would've done, either.

25:24.814 --> 25:26.916
Thank you for saying that.

25:30.153 --> 25:33.289
What time's the transport?

25:33.357 --> 25:35.456
06:30.

25:48.804 --> 25:50.906
(door opens)

25:57.312 --> 25:58.845
You said you wanted to see me.

25:58.914 --> 26:00.347
You said it was urgent.

26:00.415 --> 26:02.482
I heard we're-we're
bugging out tomorrow.

26:02.550 --> 26:05.252
You heard right.

26:05.320 --> 26:06.553
What happens then?

26:06.621 --> 26:08.389
You're officially
taken into custody

26:08.456 --> 26:10.390
and charged with treason.

26:10.457 --> 26:14.260
I meant...
what happens to you?

26:15.195 --> 26:17.463
Unclear.

26:20.301 --> 26:22.035
I'm so sorry, Martha.

26:22.102 --> 26:23.403
I really am.

26:23.470 --> 26:27.139
36 people lost
their lives today.

26:32.378 --> 26:34.413
What am I doing here, Dennis?

26:37.116 --> 26:39.551
What do you want?

26:42.255 --> 26:43.354
What do you want?

26:44.789 --> 26:47.358
Give me your belt.

26:49.294 --> 26:50.261
What?

26:50.329 --> 26:51.295
Give me

26:51.363 --> 26:53.464
your belt.

26:56.001 --> 26:57.534
I will do no such thing.

26:57.602 --> 26:58.869
Think about it, Martha.

26:58.937 --> 27:00.870
It could spare you
a lot of heartache.

27:00.938 --> 27:03.039
You mean spare you.

27:03.107 --> 27:05.241
Spare us both.

27:05.309 --> 27:07.477
No trial, no sentencing,
no public hearing.

27:07.544 --> 27:08.911
Dennis, stop.

27:08.980 --> 27:10.981
Not to mention
what's best for Toby.

27:11.048 --> 27:13.649
His father alive for one thing.

27:13.717 --> 27:14.750
A traitor?

27:14.818 --> 27:15.818
Locked up in a supermax prison?

27:15.886 --> 27:17.987
I don't think so.

27:22.558 --> 27:24.960
Are we really having
this conversation?

27:25.028 --> 27:26.428
We are.

27:26.496 --> 27:27.696
You can't possibly
expect me to...

27:27.763 --> 27:28.964
If anyone deserves
to die today...

27:29.032 --> 27:32.534
We are not having
this conversation.

27:32.602 --> 27:35.370
It might even...

27:35.437 --> 27:38.406
open a path to saving
your career.

27:43.879 --> 27:46.047
Everybody at the
State Department

27:46.115 --> 27:48.249
knows how valuable you are.

27:50.052 --> 27:52.219
- So?
- So...

27:52.286 --> 27:53.820
if I never came home,

27:53.888 --> 27:55.622
the worst of it can be
swept under the rug.

27:55.689 --> 27:56.990
"Swept under the rug"?

27:57.058 --> 27:58.758
Why not?

27:58.826 --> 28:01.461
These are the people who can
rewrite yesterday's weather.

28:06.234 --> 28:08.300
You're serious?

28:11.238 --> 28:12.505
You would actually...?

28:12.572 --> 28:14.373
It's all I've been
thinking about.

28:14.441 --> 28:17.676
It's the one good thing
that I can do now.

28:23.650 --> 28:25.017
I don't know what to say.

28:25.084 --> 28:26.418
Don't say anything.

28:26.485 --> 28:28.420
Just let it happen.

28:28.487 --> 28:29.654
My life's ruined.

28:29.721 --> 28:32.890
Yours doesn't have to be.

28:32.958 --> 28:35.793
No.

28:35.861 --> 28:38.329
No. You know I'm right.

28:38.397 --> 28:40.398
(sighs)

29:02.052 --> 29:03.786
I can't.

29:03.853 --> 29:06.122
You can.

29:06.190 --> 29:08.291
It can't...

29:10.860 --> 29:13.729
...be my belt.

29:17.467 --> 29:19.000
Mine's in the locker.

29:19.068 --> 29:21.169
Top left.

29:22.405 --> 29:24.473
Go get it, Martha.

29:47.329 --> 29:49.530
Now, bring it back here.

29:53.300 --> 29:55.401
Bring it back.

30:00.107 --> 30:02.242
Martha, please.

30:02.309 --> 30:04.910
Let me do this one last thing
for my family.

30:17.757 --> 30:20.459
(door opens)

30:24.096 --> 30:25.496
Martha?

30:32.103 --> 30:33.337
QUINN:
Come on, focus.

30:33.405 --> 30:34.672
I need a break.

30:34.739 --> 30:35.939
Listen to me.
I put a bullet

30:36.007 --> 30:37.708
in Haissam Haqqani.

30:37.776 --> 30:39.143
That means that right now
he is somewhere

30:39.211 --> 30:40.444
seeking medical attention.

30:40.512 --> 30:41.844
Likely in the same place
you were held

30:41.912 --> 30:43.547
before the exchange.

30:43.614 --> 30:45.882
This is our last
best chance to get him

30:45.949 --> 30:49.052
before he melts
back into the FATA.

30:49.119 --> 30:50.353
I told you.

30:50.421 --> 30:51.921
I didn't see anything.

30:51.989 --> 30:53.356
I was hooded the whole time.

30:53.424 --> 30:54.524
Not the whole time.
You said they took it off

30:54.592 --> 30:55.559
to make a video.

30:55.626 --> 30:56.593
The windows were blacked out.

30:56.661 --> 30:57.694
I could've been anywhere.

30:57.761 --> 30:59.428
Was it ground floor or higher?

30:59.496 --> 31:00.829
I was led up some stairs.

31:00.897 --> 31:02.097
How many flights?

31:02.165 --> 31:03.365
At least two.

31:03.433 --> 31:04.600
So, it could've been
an apartment then?

31:04.668 --> 31:06.735
Maybe. I don't know.

31:08.338 --> 31:10.005
What about the boy
with the bomb vest?

31:10.073 --> 31:11.507
Had you seen him before?

31:11.575 --> 31:12.841
No.

31:12.909 --> 31:14.943
The first time was
in that room.

31:15.011 --> 31:16.877
So, he-he could've
been from here, a local kid?

31:16.945 --> 31:19.547
Maybe from the madrassa
where we first saw Haqqani?

31:19.615 --> 31:21.048
I don't know.

31:21.116 --> 31:23.585
Never even knew his name.

31:25.287 --> 31:26.688
Okay, okay.

31:26.755 --> 31:28.756
Okay.
(clears throat)

31:28.824 --> 31:31.326
Tell me about the phones again.

31:31.393 --> 31:32.726
What about them?

31:32.793 --> 31:34.194
You said Haqqani
switched them out religiously.

31:34.262 --> 31:38.498
New burner was given to
every man every morning.

31:38.566 --> 31:40.100
Like clockwork.

31:40.167 --> 31:42.068
Was it the same make of phone
or a different one?

31:42.136 --> 31:43.337
- Oh, I don't know.
- Come on, Saul.

31:43.404 --> 31:44.838
Try to remember.
This is important.

31:44.905 --> 31:46.940
Sky Vega? Lenovo?

31:47.007 --> 31:48.174
HTC?

31:48.243 --> 31:49.842
I can't remember
what I didn't know.

31:49.909 --> 31:50.943
You had it in your hand!

31:51.010 --> 31:52.745
You called Carrie with it!

31:52.812 --> 31:55.147
I was in the mountains.
It was pitch black out there.

31:55.215 --> 31:56.482
You dialed her number.

31:56.550 --> 31:59.652
Did you dial it
on a keypad or on a screen?

31:59.720 --> 32:01.420
Oh, goddamn it, Saul!

32:01.488 --> 32:03.155
Sit up and fucking remember!

32:03.223 --> 32:04.823
Remember!

32:06.992 --> 32:08.660
I'm in the middle here.

32:08.728 --> 32:10.595
- Of what?
- Debriefing Saul.

32:10.663 --> 32:12.664
It looks more like
an interrogation to me.

32:12.732 --> 32:13.565
Maybe it is.

32:13.633 --> 32:15.734
Give him a break.

32:19.405 --> 32:21.239
In 72 hours, Haqqani
will be in the wind,

32:21.307 --> 32:23.207
and Saul is the key
to locating him

32:23.275 --> 32:24.875
before he's smuggled
out of Islamabad.

32:24.942 --> 32:27.478
We're pulling out, Quinn,
suspending relations.

32:27.545 --> 32:28.712
What are you talking about?

32:28.780 --> 32:29.980
The warden system's
been initiated,

32:30.047 --> 32:32.082
and we're under
an evacuation order.

32:32.150 --> 32:33.984
Do they not know
what went down here?

32:34.051 --> 32:35.619
- Do they not care?
- They care.

32:35.687 --> 32:36.887
And they can choose
to just walk away?

32:36.954 --> 32:38.422
Like that's an option?

32:38.490 --> 32:40.657
We're handing Haqqani
Afghanistan on a platter.

32:40.724 --> 32:42.057
Fuck that!

32:42.125 --> 32:43.426
No, not "fuck that."

32:43.494 --> 32:45.094
This time, we listen to them.

32:45.162 --> 32:46.329
- Why?
- Because for once,

32:46.397 --> 32:47.730
they're right.

32:47.798 --> 32:49.399
You don't believe that.

32:49.466 --> 32:52.735
Our diplomatic immunity is gone.

32:52.803 --> 32:54.304
Our networks are blown.
And if you're right,

32:54.371 --> 32:56.071
if Haqqani still is
in the capital,

32:56.139 --> 32:57.839
he's being protected by an army

32:57.907 --> 32:59.941
of ISI officers.
No way we get to him now.

33:00.009 --> 33:01.543
We have to try.

33:01.611 --> 33:03.178
No.

33:03.245 --> 33:04.680
Hey, you're the one
who got me here.

33:04.747 --> 33:06.047
You're the one who said
all this was important.

33:06.115 --> 33:08.016
Well, guess what? It is now.

33:08.083 --> 33:11.119
You will die trying, or worse,
and I won't allow it.

33:11.187 --> 33:13.021
The first transport leaves
for the airport

33:13.088 --> 33:14.355
tomorrow morning at 6:30.

33:14.423 --> 33:15.623
You're on it.

33:15.691 --> 33:17.658
Pack your things.
That is a direct order.

33:45.252 --> 33:47.354
What was that about?

33:47.421 --> 33:49.488
A difference of opinion.

33:51.791 --> 33:54.493
You all right?

33:54.561 --> 33:56.729
(sighs)
Not even close.

34:02.602 --> 34:04.870
I'm old.

34:04.937 --> 34:07.338
I've made a fool of my time.

34:07.406 --> 34:08.406
You haven't.

34:08.474 --> 34:10.574
Completely.

34:12.678 --> 34:15.679
People are dead because of it.

34:19.016 --> 34:22.386
I want you to know something.

34:22.453 --> 34:27.791
The attack on the embassy,
it was Haqqani's plan all along.

34:27.859 --> 34:29.893
From the very beginning.

34:29.960 --> 34:33.029
Way before you were abducted.

34:33.097 --> 34:34.398
That's why he went
to such great lengths

34:34.465 --> 34:35.998
to make us believe he was dead.

34:36.065 --> 34:39.668
That's why he had Sandy Bachman
killed in the street.

34:41.638 --> 34:44.172
Did you hear me, Saul?

34:46.242 --> 34:49.779
It was Haqqani's plan all along.

34:55.518 --> 34:57.419
Sergeant?

34:57.486 --> 35:00.288
Which ones are the Talibs?

go out the window?
