<i>My name is Marty Kaan</i>

00:02.061 --> 00:03.685
<i>and I'm a management</i>
<i>consultant.</i>

00:03.719 --> 00:05.493
<i>Every week me and my team</i>
<i>go somewhere</i>

00:05.527 --> 00:09.063
<i>and talk people into thinking</i>
<i>they really, really need us.</i>

00:09.097 --> 00:10.301
I'm not concerned
about Metro Capital.

00:10.336 --> 00:11.735
<i>You shouldn't be.</i>

00:11.769 --> 00:14.508
<i>You are good.</i>
<i>Unless you screw up.</i>

00:14.542 --> 00:16.013
Then it's a whole new ball game.

00:16.047 --> 00:17.692
It's been a pleasure
working with you, so...

00:17.726 --> 00:19.231
Yep. Stay in touch.

00:19.266 --> 00:21.034
My fortunes are
tied to yours.

00:21.069 --> 00:24.079
Which means
you dicked me over, asshole.

00:24.114 --> 00:26.285
<i>Still not sure what it is I do?</i>

00:26.319 --> 00:28.591
I need a sexy motherfucker like
you to help me work some angles.

00:28.626 --> 00:30.428
<i>Come on, enough about me.</i>

00:30.462 --> 00:32.197
<i>I'm tired of talking about me.</i>

00:32.231 --> 00:34.001
<i>Let's talk about you.</i>

Sync and corrected by dr.jackson
for www.addic7ed.com

00:40.250 --> 00:43.158
So where is it
this week?

00:43.193 --> 00:45.095
Tampa, I think.

00:45.129 --> 00:49.104
Celeste at Mons Venus.
Definitely look her up.

00:49.138 --> 00:50.772
She has a spectacular ass.

00:50.806 --> 00:52.641
She'll make
you see stars.

00:52.676 --> 00:55.179
What if I like your
spectacular ass?

00:55.213 --> 00:57.351
My ass won't be in Tampa.
Celeste's will.

00:57.386 --> 00:58.752
And when you get that itch,

00:58.787 --> 01:00.654
I want you to have
a hot little scratcher.

01:00.689 --> 01:03.358
So you think I just have
to fuck on the road,

01:03.392 --> 01:06.062
You fucked me on the road, baby.

01:07.999 --> 01:10.968
You think I can't keep my dick
in check for a couple of days?

01:11.003 --> 01:14.305
I can absolutely not fuck around
on the road, sweetheart.

01:14.340 --> 01:15.306
Baby...

01:15.341 --> 01:18.277
I know you.

01:18.311 --> 01:20.112
I know you.

01:20.146 --> 01:22.281
Okay, well, you're going
to be eating so much crow

01:22.315 --> 01:24.116
when I come back
here with blue balls

01:24.150 --> 01:26.052
you're going to have feathers
coming out of your ass.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.287
- Really?
- Really.

01:28.322 --> 01:29.623
Yeah.

01:29.657 --> 01:32.025
Well, if you do come back
with them,

01:32.059 --> 01:33.895
I might be able to help you out.

01:33.929 --> 01:35.130
How?

01:35.164 --> 01:36.131
I don't know--

01:36.165 --> 01:38.568
with this--

01:38.602 --> 01:40.071
bareback.

01:40.105 --> 01:41.973
Bareback?

01:47.399 --> 01:49.999
HOUSE OF LIES
S01 Ep.07 - Bareback Town

01:50.020 --> 01:52.222
It was the summer
after seventh grade

01:52.256 --> 01:55.392
and she just stopped
eating all together.

01:55.427 --> 01:58.095
Started losing all this weight,
and it was really sad.

01:58.130 --> 01:59.397
You fatties talking
about diets again?

01:59.431 --> 02:01.198
Jeannie, I'm sorry,
do you mind?

02:01.233 --> 02:04.169
- Clyde, go on.
- Thank you, Doug.

02:04.203 --> 02:06.037
She was throwing up all the
time, losing her hair.

02:06.072 --> 02:07.572
I couldn't
even watch it.

02:07.607 --> 02:09.875
That happened to a girl on
my floor in college-- bulimia.

02:09.908 --> 02:11.677
Jeannie, a little
sensitivity.

02:11.711 --> 02:13.678
Clyde is right in the middle of
a very personal story about...

02:13.713 --> 02:15.414
- Coco.
- Coco.

02:15.448 --> 02:16.883
Who's that, your grandmother?

02:16.917 --> 02:19.186
It was my dog, Jeannie.
I'm just going to finish up.

02:19.220 --> 02:19.600
Sorry.

02:19.601 --> 02:21.122
I still remember, it
was the day before

02:21.156 --> 02:23.058
I was supposed
to start eighth grade.

02:23.093 --> 02:26.396
I fell asleep with Coco
on the laundry room floor.

02:26.430 --> 02:28.599
I remembered the heat
from her warm body

02:28.633 --> 02:30.602
as she cuddled up next to me.

02:30.636 --> 02:34.072
I fell asleep to the
sound of her breathing.

02:34.107 --> 02:36.876
And then when I woke up,
she was dead.

02:36.910 --> 02:38.645
- Oh, my God.
- No.

02:38.679 --> 02:40.080
- I'm so sorry.
- Coco.

02:40.114 --> 02:42.984
Yeah, except that shit
never happened.

02:43.018 --> 02:45.788
- What?

02:45.822 --> 02:48.625
That is why, my friends,
I will always be penis deep

02:48.659 --> 02:51.128
in the lady vah-jay-jay.

02:51.162 --> 02:52.729
You really lead to add a "lady"
in front of that?

02:52.764 --> 02:54.498
You've just witnessed
the story of Coco.

02:54.533 --> 02:57.168
- That is my sure thing.
- Leg opener.

02:57.203 --> 02:58.336
My ace in her hole.

02:58.371 --> 03:00.305
Don't encourage him.

03:00.340 --> 03:01.574
Hey, we're out of
here, guys, okay?

03:01.608 --> 03:03.142
Tampa's off, D.C. is on.

03:03.177 --> 03:05.345
- What's the new job?
- Novax Pharmaceutical.

03:05.380 --> 03:07.615
We were specifically requested
by the CMO.

03:07.649 --> 03:09.817
- You know why?
- Doesn't matter.

03:09.851 --> 03:12.687
Brenda is a very good,
and very horny friend of mine,

03:12.721 --> 03:14.489
and when she calls,
we come, Jeannie baby.

03:21.631 --> 03:23.331
Hey, uh, hey, Marty,

03:23.366 --> 03:26.335
listen, I just... I
want you to know that

03:26.369 --> 03:28.804
whatever happens
with Metro Capital,

03:28.838 --> 03:30.806
you have my total support.

03:30.840 --> 03:32.808
- Thank you.
- I mean it.

03:32.842 --> 03:34.645
You've been a great
mentor to me.

03:34.646 --> 03:35.812
I'm not your mentor.

03:35.846 --> 03:39.116
Maybe not officially,
but, hey,

03:39.151 --> 03:40.384
you know, I never told you
this before,

03:40.419 --> 03:43.888
but the firm had originally
assigned me to Michael Gimble.

03:43.923 --> 03:46.058
- What?!
- I know, right?

03:46.092 --> 03:47.727
Talk about an odd couple.

03:47.761 --> 03:48.814
Oil and water.

03:48.815 --> 03:51.898
Exactly. Not like this.
Peas in a pod.

03:51.932 --> 03:54.801
You and me-- we finish
each other's...

03:54.836 --> 03:56.136
sentences.

03:56.170 --> 03:57.404
You know, anyway,
I just, I think...

03:57.439 --> 04:00.642
I just think you
and I really established

04:00.676 --> 04:02.435
a mentor-mentee relationship.

04:02.436 --> 04:03.345
We have not.

04:03.380 --> 04:07.350
Well, in any case,
Doug Guggenheim's got your back.

04:07.384 --> 04:08.584
I am so comforted.

04:08.619 --> 04:12.688
<i>We are making our final
descent into Washington, DC.</i>

04:12.723 --> 04:14.424
<i>Temperature is 52 degrees
and sunny.</i>

04:16.593 --> 04:18.494
<i>I see you'll be staying</i>

04:18.529 --> 04:20.363
three nights with us,
Mr. Guggenheim.

04:20.397 --> 04:21.831
Yeah, that's right.
We all are.

04:21.865 --> 04:24.667
I'm sorry, are you related
to the Guggenheims?

04:24.702 --> 04:28.238
- It's just, I'm an art major at G.W.
- I see.

04:28.272 --> 04:30.207
No... Well, I really don't
like to talk about it too much.

04:30.241 --> 04:32.008
Then don't talk
about it.

04:32.043 --> 04:34.010
I'll take it from here.
He's not related to anybody.

04:34.044 --> 04:36.746
What is it? Is it Britney?

04:36.780 --> 04:38.881
Sorry, just to interrupt
there, no, my mother is

04:38.916 --> 04:40.049
- a distant relative, so...
- Stop for one second.

04:40.083 --> 04:42.518
- Honestly, just for one second.
- Okay.

04:42.552 --> 04:43.785
That is a gorgeous name.

04:43.820 --> 04:45.087
- It really is.
- It's Italian for

04:45.121 --> 04:46.521
"She with the hot face."

04:46.555 --> 04:47.855
I don't think so.

04:47.890 --> 04:49.891
- I think it should be.
- Definitely not, though.

04:49.925 --> 04:51.792
That would be...

04:51.827 --> 04:53.027
So wrong again.

04:53.061 --> 04:54.595
Come on, just
for one second.

04:54.629 --> 04:55.963
Do you have our
phone numbers in there?

04:55.997 --> 04:59.321
Britney, if I could-- Britney is, in
fact, Latin meaning "from Britain."

04:59.322 --> 05:01.436
Doug why don't you stop making
shit up for one second.

05:01.470 --> 05:03.405
- I'm not making anything up.
- Stop for one second.

05:03.439 --> 05:05.874
- I minored in linguistics.
- You didn't minor in any--

05:05.908 --> 05:09.144
<i>Novax is battling Pfizer</i>
<i>to develop new drugs.</i>

05:09.178 --> 05:10.065
But before we go on,

05:10.066 --> 05:12.815
I know that Galweather does a
lot of consulting for Pfizer.

05:12.849 --> 05:14.383
This will not
interfere with that.

05:14.418 --> 05:16.319
Tod Walton's our
account rep for that group.

05:16.353 --> 05:17.720
But it's a totally
different division.

05:17.721 --> 05:18.421
- We're good.
- Great.

05:18.455 --> 05:20.089
You ever heard of Cepazine?

05:20.124 --> 05:22.425
Who hasn't?
It's only the most powerful

05:22.459 --> 05:24.760
and successful antidepressant
on the market.

05:24.795 --> 05:27.730
Also happens to be Novax's
number-one seller, I think.

05:27.764 --> 05:31.400
- I did my research on the plane.
- Well, recent clinical studies

05:31.435 --> 05:33.802
also have shown that it helps
treat adolescent acne.

05:33.837 --> 05:36.505
Well, that's great
for all those zitty kids

05:36.539 --> 05:39.175
but we're consultants, we're not
scientists-- what's up?

05:39.209 --> 05:41.644
This is a marketing plan
my team sculpted.

05:41.678 --> 05:43.512
We estimate that we
can increase revenue

05:43.546 --> 05:46.115
by almost 30%
for the company.

05:46.149 --> 05:47.782
So you just want us

05:47.817 --> 05:49.518
to rubber-stamp your
genius business plan?

05:49.552 --> 05:51.320
No, I want you
to put it through

05:51.354 --> 05:53.522
the rigorous analysis that
Galweather's known for.

05:53.556 --> 05:55.257
And then rubber-stamp it.

05:55.291 --> 05:56.925
And then rubber-stamp it.

05:59.127 --> 06:00.828
The CEO is a
ball-fucking-buster, all right?

06:00.863 --> 06:02.831
If this doesn't get green-lit,
I'm out.

06:02.865 --> 06:03.899
And If I'm out...

06:03.900 --> 06:05.968
Brenda, it's okay. We got this.

06:06.002 --> 06:08.504
I'm still running marathons.

06:08.538 --> 06:11.974
And my ass-- titanium.

06:12.009 --> 06:13.209
Yeah, I checked that out.

06:13.243 --> 06:16.778
Well, maybe if you're lucky, I'll
let you spank it after dinner.

06:19.548 --> 06:20.815
See you at 7:00?

06:20.849 --> 06:24.519
- That sounds great.
- Great.

06:29.057 --> 06:30.057
Kinsley?

06:32.094 --> 06:33.561
I'm hurt.

06:33.595 --> 06:35.129
She's here on
another engagement.

06:35.163 --> 06:36.864
That's not going to be
a problem, is it?

06:36.898 --> 06:39.567
I don't think so.

06:39.601 --> 06:40.968
Perfect.

06:42.103 --> 06:43.837
Fuck.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.173
I like when I see you
with your little girlfriends.

06:46.207 --> 06:48.308
What are you doing here?
Just spying on me?

06:48.342 --> 06:49.675
No.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.844
Billing obscene amounts
of extra hours

06:51.879 --> 06:53.046
on top of
my yearly number.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.748
On top of your... bullshit.

06:55.782 --> 06:57.183
Really?

06:57.217 --> 06:59.151
I have got five minutes,

06:59.186 --> 07:01.220
some whip-its and the key
to the executive bathroom.

07:01.254 --> 07:04.523
Wait, hold on one second, okay?

07:07.259 --> 07:08.960
I will find you.

07:10.896 --> 07:13.098
So all we need to do is
base-line Brenda's number.

07:13.401 --> 07:15.370
Add some value engineering,
hand job, hand job, hand job.

07:15.404 --> 07:17.272
Do some due diligence.

07:17.306 --> 07:19.474
I don't know, maybe sex it up,
put some gap analysis.

07:19.509 --> 07:22.144
Architect a deck that supports
the sales projections, and...

07:22.178 --> 07:25.381
We bill Novax for
the entire engagement

07:25.416 --> 07:27.750
at 100% billability.

07:28.919 --> 07:30.420
Billability:

07:30.455 --> 07:32.790
The metric by which consultants
tangibly prove

07:32.824 --> 07:34.124
their worth to the company.

07:34.159 --> 07:35.659
Measured in percentages,

07:35.693 --> 07:37.994
it's the amount of time
that you bill a client.

07:38.028 --> 07:39.795
High billability means
you're not wasting time.

07:39.830 --> 07:42.832
Billing 100% of your time
is the nuts.

07:42.866 --> 07:45.333
And because this is
an emergency situation,

07:45.368 --> 07:46.668
the fee is doubled.

07:46.702 --> 07:49.637
And that is the stuff
of legends.

07:49.672 --> 07:52.407
It's so pretty!

07:52.441 --> 07:55.309
Let's not forget,
that with this engagement,

07:55.344 --> 07:57.645
Daddy's going to make
his yearly billable target.

07:57.679 --> 07:59.447
The holy grail.

07:59.481 --> 08:02.349
Three months ahead
of schedule, no less.

08:02.384 --> 08:04.752
And when Daddy makes his number,
what happens with Daddy's kids?

08:04.786 --> 08:05.954
I got this one.

08:05.988 --> 08:08.089
- We get our own telethon?
- Wrong.

08:08.124 --> 08:09.858
We make our numbers.

08:09.892 --> 08:14.495
And we will be golden-- as in
"merger untouchable" golden.

08:14.530 --> 08:15.763
Well, you know, since we don't
need a SWOT analysis,

08:15.798 --> 08:17.431
how about Doug Guggenheim
starts populating

08:17.466 --> 08:18.451
an 80-20 model, you hear me?

08:18.452 --> 08:19.366
No, no, no, stop, stop.

08:19.401 --> 08:21.702
I own those work streams,
I'll do that, that's me.

08:21.736 --> 08:23.437
But I think it makes sense.

08:23.472 --> 08:25.172
I've already chunked out
the prelim data on the plane...

08:25.207 --> 08:26.540
Doug doesn't think.
Doug crunches numbers,

08:26.574 --> 08:28.208
I build models.
That's what I do.

08:28.242 --> 08:30.010
That is my job,
so I'll do it.

08:30.044 --> 08:30.738
- Whoa.
- I'm fine.

08:30.739 --> 08:32.124
I'm just saying that's me.
I'll do it.

08:32.125 --> 08:33.145
Clyde, Clyde, this
is a cakewalk.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.349
- Let Doug grab it.
- You got it.

08:40.822 --> 08:42.357
203.

08:42.390 --> 08:44.226
I'll just meet you
over there then, I guess.

08:44.260 --> 08:45.727
We need a cleanup
crew in here.

08:45.761 --> 08:47.328
- It's a true story.
- You're funny.

08:47.363 --> 08:49.130
No, about a hand.

08:49.165 --> 08:50.899
Growing the hand.

08:50.933 --> 08:52.701
Honestly, the first time
I saw it, I got a nose bleed.

08:52.735 --> 08:54.403
I like to know what
people think honestly.

08:54.404 --> 08:54.869
Of course.

08:54.904 --> 08:57.005
I mean, appearance is great for
art and everything. Excuse me.

08:57.039 --> 08:58.306
Can I, uh,
give you a hand?

08:58.340 --> 08:59.540
I know my way
around a lady's sweater.

08:59.574 --> 09:01.208
Do you?

09:01.243 --> 09:02.877
I've said too much.

09:10.251 --> 09:12.019
<i>Four little bottles, Marty.</i>

09:12.053 --> 09:16.890
Two for you and two for me.

09:19.027 --> 09:20.495
Now that we've
moved on

09:20.529 --> 09:23.331
to awkward drinks
in my boss's room,

09:23.366 --> 09:25.167
thank you so much for
inviting me to dinner.

09:25.201 --> 09:26.502
I'm going to get
going now, Marty,

09:26.536 --> 09:27.837
and start working
on the deck, okay?

09:27.871 --> 09:29.338
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You're good.

09:29.373 --> 09:30.740
Let's just have a...
you know, stay.

09:30.774 --> 09:31.194
Okay.

09:31.195 --> 09:32.876
Have a nightcap. Here you go.

09:32.910 --> 09:34.210
Mmm, this is good.
Stay.

09:34.245 --> 09:36.779
Is it hot in here,
or is it just me?

09:36.813 --> 09:39.581
Va-va-va-voom.

09:39.615 --> 09:40.849
Hi.

09:40.883 --> 09:42.283
Brenda is a
marathon runner.

09:43.652 --> 09:44.860
- Impressive.
- Yeah.

09:44.861 --> 09:47.623
My best time is three
hours and 42 minutes.

09:47.657 --> 09:50.625
Almost as long
as Marty and my last...

09:54.597 --> 09:55.931
Almost.

09:55.966 --> 09:58.235
This man
is insatiable.

09:58.269 --> 10:00.705
- Yeah.
- How nice for you.

10:00.739 --> 10:03.207
The fact that we scratch
each other's back, literally,

10:03.241 --> 10:05.075
is just a bonus--
a bonus that I'm

10:05.110 --> 10:07.311
looking forward
to having tonight.

10:07.345 --> 10:10.114
Yeah, about that--
you see, I am just

10:10.149 --> 10:13.485
getting over this
really nasty UTI,

10:13.519 --> 10:15.154
and, uh, it's really

10:15.188 --> 10:17.389
got me out of commission, so...

10:18.925 --> 10:21.126
Well, I'm fucking
someone tonight.

10:28.667 --> 10:30.834
I am not fucking
that sloppy Maryland housewife.

10:30.869 --> 10:31.329
Shh.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.170
That is so not in
my job description.

10:33.204 --> 10:34.838
In the broadest
definition, it is.

10:34.873 --> 10:37.675
Our job is to make the client
happy, no matter what.

10:37.709 --> 10:38.943
Then you fuck her.

10:38.977 --> 10:40.178
I'm not.

10:40.212 --> 10:41.913
Why?

10:43.182 --> 10:44.482
You fuck
everything, Marty.

10:44.517 --> 10:45.750
I know that.

10:45.785 --> 10:47.152
This is a perfect
situation.

10:47.186 --> 10:48.920
There's no consequences,
no strings attached.

10:48.955 --> 10:50.365
It-it's not going down, okay?

10:50.366 --> 10:52.358
So you can just forget about it.
I'm...

10:52.392 --> 10:53.826
Wait.

10:53.860 --> 10:55.695
Do you have a girlfriend?

10:55.729 --> 10:57.129
No.

10:57.164 --> 10:58.430
No.

10:58.465 --> 10:59.965
You do-- you have
a girlfriend.

11:01.468 --> 11:02.702
Who would date you?

11:02.736 --> 11:05.438
Listen to me--
we have to have

11:05.472 --> 11:07.106
this engagement.

11:07.141 --> 11:08.675
Do you hear what
I'm saying?

11:08.709 --> 11:10.110
If this merger
goes down

11:10.144 --> 11:11.978
and we don't lock up
this business,

11:12.013 --> 11:14.814
we're not going to have
jobs to go back to.

11:14.849 --> 11:16.215
Is it really that bad?

11:16.250 --> 11:17.950
Yes, it's that bad.

11:17.985 --> 11:19.819
- Fuck.
- Listen, listen.

11:21.354 --> 11:23.389
Maybe they have strap-ons
in the gift shop.

11:23.423 --> 11:25.057
Pig.

11:26.359 --> 11:28.359
Hey, Bren, so I'm
going to take off.

11:28.394 --> 11:31.229
Before Coco got sick,
he was just

11:31.263 --> 11:32.797
the cutest little
thing, you know.

11:32.831 --> 11:35.900
He was all black
and white and shaggy.

11:35.935 --> 11:37.402
I can still
feel the weight

11:37.436 --> 11:40.172
of his bony little body
just curled up on my lap,

11:40.206 --> 11:43.675
staring up at me with those
sad little cancer eyes.

11:43.710 --> 11:45.678
I don't know.

11:45.712 --> 11:49.382
Sometimes I just
miss Coco so much.

11:49.416 --> 11:50.003
Yeah.

11:50.004 --> 11:52.352
Coco was a she,
you fucking dick!

11:52.386 --> 11:54.588
That dog meant
everything to me!

11:54.622 --> 11:56.323
What fucking dog?!
Coco was mine!

11:56.357 --> 11:58.825
You get your own
fake animal!

11:58.860 --> 12:00.993
You made up that dog
to get pussy!

12:01.028 --> 12:02.862
It's a stupid
fucking story, man!

12:02.896 --> 12:05.197
So stupid you
fucking stole it?

12:05.231 --> 12:07.165
As if you were going
to use it, anyway.

12:07.199 --> 12:10.068
I was. I had a date
with Britney tomorrow.

12:10.102 --> 12:12.170
Right?

12:12.204 --> 12:14.038
Sorry.

12:18.545 --> 12:21.180
Just two seconds.

12:22.983 --> 12:24.884
I'll put on
a naughty movie.

12:27.722 --> 12:32.360
Hey. Marty told me how
much you like va-jay-jay.

12:33.796 --> 12:36.531
Are you
okay in there?

12:36.566 --> 12:39.200
Yeah, I think
I just had some, um...

12:39.235 --> 12:41.102
some bad shrimp at dinner.

12:42.405 --> 12:44.272
That doesn't bother me.

12:48.445 --> 12:49.879
Now, you want your back flat.
It's kind of...

12:49.913 --> 12:51.547
- Your shoulders are...
- That's better.

12:51.581 --> 12:51.921
Okay.

12:51.922 --> 12:53.282
And just bend at the waist.
Top one, turn over

12:53.316 --> 12:55.618
to the bottom and get that
left shoulder behind the ball.

12:55.653 --> 12:56.007
Okay.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.421
And now you're in good position,

12:57.455 --> 12:59.122
and from there,
you just... you fire.

12:59.157 --> 13:00.557
- Okay.
- How's that feel?

13:00.591 --> 13:02.493
Marty, come on, man.
I can't feel my fingers.

13:02.527 --> 13:04.161
- I really got to pee.
- Come on.

13:04.196 --> 13:05.930
Do you want to go to jail?
Do you two want...

13:05.964 --> 13:07.399
You know what? Officer,
take these guys to jail.

13:07.433 --> 13:08.800
- No!
- No, I don't want to go to jail.

13:08.834 --> 13:11.236
- Then shut the fuck up.
- Yeah, shut the fuck up!

13:11.270 --> 13:13.171
- Okay.
- Jesus.

13:14.674 --> 13:17.576
Well, you broke my glasses,
so...

13:22.182 --> 13:24.851
You're going to give me
the silent treatment?

13:24.885 --> 13:26.419
That's fine with me.

13:26.453 --> 13:27.653
God.

13:27.688 --> 13:28.921
You want silent,
you got it.

13:28.956 --> 13:30.189
I'm a fucking
Trappist monk.

13:30.224 --> 13:31.657
I'm not going
to say a word.

13:31.692 --> 13:35.228
And you're just not going to talk to
me for the rest of my life? Fine.

13:36.177 --> 13:37.811
Doug, I build
the impact assessments.

13:37.846 --> 13:39.680
I do the metric modeling--
that's what I do--

13:39.715 --> 13:41.549
so why would you steal that
from me,

13:41.583 --> 13:42.931
We're supposed to
be brothers, man.

13:42.932 --> 13:44.541
We're supposed to look
out for each other.

13:44.542 --> 13:45.552
Do you remember that part?

13:45.831 --> 13:47.070
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

13:47.071 --> 13:49.838
What the fuck are
you talking about?

13:49.871 --> 13:53.096
You think I don't see all your fucking
teacher's pet ass kissing every day?

13:53.097 --> 13:53.902
What?

13:53.936 --> 13:55.091
What do you mean, what?
With Marty.

13:55.092 --> 13:56.738
"I'll get "those reports for you.
I'll get all that data for you.

13:56.731 --> 13:58.765
- I want to suck your dick."
- Marty's my mentor.

13:58.799 --> 14:00.566
No, he's not, Doug.
He's not.

14:05.339 --> 14:07.740
What does it matter
anyway, right?

14:07.774 --> 14:09.208
We're all going to be working

14:09.243 --> 14:10.677
for fucking Douche Bag Norbert
in two minutes.

14:14.115 --> 14:15.916
My God.
That's what this is about?

14:15.950 --> 14:17.551
You're freaking out
about the merger?

14:17.585 --> 14:18.986
And you're not?

14:19.020 --> 14:20.387
You should be.

14:20.422 --> 14:21.889
I'd like to give
you my card.

14:21.923 --> 14:23.424
Put you in touch
with the head pro

14:23.459 --> 14:25.006
at Congressional and
get you a nice round.

14:25.007 --> 14:25.393
Shut up.

14:25.427 --> 14:26.661
On me. Absolutely.
My God.

14:26.695 --> 14:28.263
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Officer.

14:28.297 --> 14:29.931
- All right. Have a good night.
- You, too.

14:29.965 --> 14:31.166
You dickheads.

14:31.200 --> 14:31.731
- Us? 
- Yeah.

14:31.732 --> 14:32.734
He started it.

14:32.768 --> 14:35.223
White guys in handcuffs-- that's
not even supposed to happen.

14:35.224 --> 14:35.837
Come on.

14:35.871 --> 14:37.138
Okay.

14:39.442 --> 14:40.975
Okay.

14:41.010 --> 14:43.678
I guess I'm going
to have to call Marty.

14:43.712 --> 14:47.115
No, no, no, baby. I am, uh...
I-I will be right out.

14:48.383 --> 14:50.150
<i>And I am going to make you</i>

14:50.185 --> 14:54.788
feel so... nice.

14:56.000 --> 15:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:05.400 --> 15:07.968
You're very pretty.

15:09.804 --> 15:14.141
And I am going to finger-bang
you so hard tonight.

15:14.175 --> 15:16.509
I'm all over that.

15:16.544 --> 15:18.178
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:18.212 --> 15:20.113
All right.

15:27.021 --> 15:29.256
There you go.

15:37.733 --> 15:39.400
Hey, little man.

15:39.434 --> 15:40.968
What can I get you to eat?

15:41.002 --> 15:42.403
My name is Roscoe,

15:42.437 --> 15:44.405
and my grandpa
makes me breakfast.

15:44.439 --> 15:47.041
Where is he?

15:53.447 --> 15:54.680
Grandpa!

15:54.715 --> 15:56.149
What's wrong?!

15:57.518 --> 15:59.686
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

16:01.889 --> 16:03.890
Are you sure you're going
to be all right, Grandpa?

16:03.925 --> 16:06.961
I'm fine. I just slipped.

16:09.364 --> 16:11.198
I think we should take him
to the hospital.

16:11.233 --> 16:13.000
That's nonsense.

16:13.035 --> 16:14.602
No, everything
is just fine.

16:14.636 --> 16:16.403
April's going
to take you to school.

16:16.438 --> 16:18.605
Yeah... I will.

16:18.640 --> 16:20.007
But I promise
I'll come right back

16:20.041 --> 16:21.275
and stay
with him, okay?

16:24.479 --> 16:26.746
Okay.

16:26.781 --> 16:27.813
Won't even know.
We're like magicians.

16:27.814 --> 16:28.581
We're not going to bury it.

16:28.616 --> 16:30.183
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.
We are going to bury it.

16:30.218 --> 16:30.565
No, we're...

16:30.566 --> 16:31.518
Somebody need a diaper change?

16:31.552 --> 16:33.119
I can hear you guys
all the way in the hall.

16:33.154 --> 16:34.554
Take it easy.
What's up?

16:34.588 --> 16:36.689
I was going through the
data, and I found...

16:36.723 --> 16:37.373
That everything works.

16:37.374 --> 16:38.791
- Everything is amazing.
- We deserve high-fives.

16:38.826 --> 16:39.959
Will you two shut up, please?

16:39.993 --> 16:41.927
- What?
- A glitch.

16:41.962 --> 16:45.831
Some of the testing from
Novax-- it's not so positive.

16:45.832 --> 16:49.534
"Highly adverse effects "on teens,
including, but not limited

16:49.568 --> 16:52.904
to migraines, depression and
increased risk of suicide."

16:52.938 --> 16:55.072
Convenient that Brenda forgot
to include these results

16:55.106 --> 16:56.406
- in her study.
- Or, Jeannie,

16:56.441 --> 16:57.874
do you think it's because

16:57.909 --> 16:59.443
you're still mad
at the whole...

16:59.477 --> 17:01.478
- Or would it be this way?
- Would it be...

17:01.513 --> 17:03.480
Can we please try to be
adults for one second here?

17:03.515 --> 17:05.415
We can't endorse
Brenda's pitch.

17:05.450 --> 17:09.086
Marty, those are internal studies.
And inconclusive.

17:09.119 --> 17:11.221
I got to say, I agree
with Doug and Clyde.

17:11.256 --> 17:12.827
We are here to rerun numbers

17:12.828 --> 17:16.026
and make sure we have the
same profit margin as Brenda.

17:19.143 --> 17:21.743
You soulless
motherfucker.

17:21.779 --> 17:24.512
You didn't even bat an eyelash
when you made that decision.

17:24.548 --> 17:26.682
No, I didn't.
The question is, why did you?

17:26.715 --> 17:28.349
Are you punking out?

17:28.827 --> 17:30.828
No, Marty, I'm
not punking out.

17:30.862 --> 17:33.464
I'm game, okay? And I think
I proved that by practically

17:33.498 --> 17:35.288
roofie-ing a client last
night to get this deal.

17:35.289 --> 17:36.392
- What?
-  Whoa! My God.

17:36.393 --> 17:38.969
And that showed great
initiative, by the way, I have to say.

17:39.021 --> 17:40.255
I mean, I told her
just to fuck her.

17:40.282 --> 17:41.582
I didn't say anything
about roofie-ing.

17:41.616 --> 17:43.317
I am trying to be
serious right now.

17:43.927 --> 17:46.228
Is there anything
that you won't do?

17:46.263 --> 17:48.197
Anything?

17:48.232 --> 17:50.167
Not a rhetorical
question, girls.

17:50.201 --> 17:52.269
Is there a line that
you won't cross?

17:52.303 --> 17:55.208
Please, Jeannie, like you're
the paragon of business morality.

17:55.209 --> 17:55.914
For one second,

17:55.915 --> 17:58.732
let's remember the old bait and switch
you pulled at the Cheesecake Factory.

17:58.733 --> 17:59.944
- Yes.
- Now, how many people

17:59.978 --> 18:01.278
lost their jobs because
of you, Jeannie?

18:01.313 --> 18:02.713
That was a cost-saving measure

18:02.747 --> 18:03.948
and no one ended up dead.

18:03.983 --> 18:06.017
There is no line. Okay?

18:06.051 --> 18:08.119
There's just the job.

18:08.153 --> 18:11.022
On this engagement, your job
is to gauge the market

18:11.057 --> 18:12.691
and assess the effectiveness

18:12.725 --> 18:14.526
of a marketing plan.
That's it.

18:14.560 --> 18:16.561
It's not that fucking difficult.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.897
We're doing our part.
Let the FDA do theirs.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.933
Oh, my God. You...

18:20.967 --> 18:22.567
you could rationalize
the Holocaust,

18:22.601 --> 18:23.969
if you tried hard enough.

18:28.141 --> 18:31.478
You're here for one reason
and one reason only:

18:31.512 --> 18:32.946
to maximize
shareholder return.

18:32.980 --> 18:36.950
Sacrificing profit
for any other concern

18:36.984 --> 18:39.519
is a violation of your fiduciary
responsibility, Jeannie.

18:39.520 --> 18:40.153
It is not...

18:40.187 --> 18:41.687
You're going to get
us all shit-canned!

19:04.979 --> 19:07.314
Jesus, Monica...

19:07.348 --> 19:10.851
There is another one of these,
but I want you to find it...

19:12.955 --> 19:14.156
I can't.

19:14.190 --> 19:15.991
You can't,

19:16.025 --> 19:17.426
I don't know, that's not what

19:17.460 --> 19:19.194
that hard-on is saying to me.

19:19.228 --> 19:20.996
Man...

19:21.030 --> 19:22.364
Monica, I'm-I'm serious...

19:22.398 --> 19:23.799
Okay.

19:23.833 --> 19:26.000
This is one of those,
this is one of those

19:26.035 --> 19:28.436
role-reversals of our
"innocent virgin" game?

19:28.470 --> 19:30.004
- Me likey.
- Monica, Monica...

19:30.038 --> 19:31.639
- Fucking take me...
- Shit. No.

19:31.673 --> 19:33.841
No?

19:33.875 --> 19:35.809
No? Seriously?

19:35.844 --> 19:37.311
What do you mean, no?

19:37.345 --> 19:39.881
Let me break it down for you:

19:39.915 --> 19:41.449
Brenda, Pinto.

19:41.483 --> 19:43.451
Me, Lamborghini.

19:43.486 --> 19:44.819
Are you jealous?

19:44.854 --> 19:47.523
No, wait a minute,
you can't be jealous.

19:47.557 --> 19:48.519
Sociopaths can't feel emotion.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.059
Let's have a taste of
that, and we'll talk...

19:50.094 --> 19:51.327
Listen, listen.
Let me be clear.

19:51.362 --> 19:53.463
We're not a thing.

19:53.498 --> 19:56.333
We're not a couple,
we're not dating,

19:56.368 --> 19:58.769
we're definitely
not family.

19:59.404 --> 20:02.406
So... no.

20:07.411 --> 20:09.846
That's fucking great.

20:13.284 --> 20:15.819
Hi.

20:26.864 --> 20:29.265
Look, I know what you
told Roscoe is a lie.

20:29.299 --> 20:31.734
I'm not stupid.

20:36.440 --> 20:38.875
All right, wait.

20:41.913 --> 20:44.581
Doctor says
I have Parkinson's.

20:46.618 --> 20:48.920
Heard that's a lot of fun.

20:48.954 --> 20:50.288
Yeah, a real party.

20:50.322 --> 20:51.890
How long have you known?

20:51.924 --> 20:53.726
Couple months.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.894
They've been tweaking my meds.

20:55.929 --> 20:58.030
I guess they haven't gotten
them quite right yet.

20:58.064 --> 20:59.465
Obviously.

20:59.499 --> 21:00.899
They make me dizzy.

21:00.933 --> 21:03.501
But I'll be fine.

21:05.605 --> 21:06.972
Don't tell Marty.

21:07.006 --> 21:09.407
Well, I-I...

21:11.443 --> 21:12.877
I need to tell him myself.

21:18.149 --> 21:19.750
You. Last night?

21:19.784 --> 21:22.153
Hot.

21:23.422 --> 21:25.824
<i>So as you can see,</i>

21:25.858 --> 21:27.592
with our independent
regression model,

21:27.627 --> 21:28.927
that our numbers aligned

21:28.961 --> 21:31.329
within three percent
of Brenda's.

21:31.364 --> 21:34.500
Well within the expected
margin of error.

21:34.534 --> 21:36.969
What about the adverse testing?

21:38.805 --> 21:41.940
Well, since that was an
internally engineered study,

21:41.974 --> 21:44.943
there's no real obligation to
disclose the results, is there?

21:44.977 --> 21:46.811
No legal obligation.

21:46.845 --> 21:48.779
What about ethical
responsibility?

21:48.813 --> 21:50.947
By not taking those findings
into consideration,

21:50.982 --> 21:53.616
you're basically condoning
the potential deaths

21:53.651 --> 21:55.084
of God knows how many children.

21:55.119 --> 21:57.987
No. I think we're done here.

21:59.323 --> 22:01.824
Brenda, I gotta say,
little disappointed.

22:03.694 --> 22:06.962
This... isn't good.

22:06.997 --> 22:09.598
There is only one
thing left to do.

22:09.633 --> 22:11.967
Pull It Out Of Thin Air.
Defcon 5.

22:12.002 --> 22:14.036
This is when you have to
use all your resources,

22:14.070 --> 22:16.271
your smarts, your intuition,
tips, tricks,

22:16.306 --> 22:17.773
anything you can,

22:17.807 --> 22:20.375
to secure a palatable
outcome for the client.

22:20.409 --> 22:23.011
Prostrate yourself,
sell your fucking mother,

22:23.045 --> 22:25.980
even tell the truth, if you
have to, do whatever it takes,

22:26.015 --> 22:28.649
but get the business.

22:31.686 --> 22:34.421
Can I be honest with you, Matt?

22:35.757 --> 22:38.625
Brenda hid the results
from us, too.

22:38.660 --> 22:40.528
This was something that
was discovered by Jeannie

22:40.562 --> 22:42.363
in the raw data.

22:42.397 --> 22:43.831
We'll talk later.

22:43.865 --> 22:45.833
But we have blue-skied
a Plan B option,

22:45.867 --> 22:47.167
if you'd like to hear it.

22:47.201 --> 22:48.569
I'm listening.

22:51.239 --> 22:52.840
He's listening.

22:55.077 --> 22:58.480
Go to market early
with a generic Lipitor.

22:58.514 --> 23:00.682
It's Pfizer's
number-one selling drug.

23:00.716 --> 23:02.884
I think it's time they shared
with the rest of the class.

23:02.919 --> 23:04.686
We can't do that,
we'd get sued up the ass.

23:04.720 --> 23:05.215
Yeah, but...

23:05.216 --> 23:06.822
By the time the case
comes to court,

23:06.856 --> 23:09.158
you could fund your defense
from your sales profit.

23:09.192 --> 23:10.276
And pay millions in fines.

23:10.277 --> 23:11.860
But compared to
your profit margin?

23:11.894 --> 23:14.763
- Drop in the ocean.
- It's a drop in the ocean.

23:16.465 --> 23:18.734
You have no conscience.

23:24.106 --> 23:25.874
But your plan...

23:25.908 --> 23:28.443
that's something
I can get behind.

23:28.477 --> 23:30.846
Thank you. Thank you.

23:33.395 --> 23:36.497
I'll catch up.
You guys go ahead.

23:38.005 --> 23:40.007
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:40.741 --> 23:42.275
- That sucked.
- Yeah.

23:42.309 --> 23:43.543
Don't worry about it.

23:43.577 --> 23:45.211
I just wanted
to say good-bye.

23:45.246 --> 23:46.780
Want me to call Holland,
see if I can, uh...

23:47.078 --> 23:49.880
- No. I have another offer.
- Good.

23:49.915 --> 23:51.215
At Pfizer.

23:51.249 --> 23:53.317
I know. Crazy, right?

23:53.351 --> 23:55.819
They're gonna love hearing
all about that blue-sky plan.

23:55.854 --> 23:57.280
I don't think you
want to do that.

23:57.281 --> 24:00.357
Marty...
You want to fuck me? Fine.

24:00.392 --> 24:01.925
You want to fuck me over?

24:01.959 --> 24:03.360
That's gonna cost you.

24:03.394 --> 24:05.529
What I want to do
is cut your dick off,

24:05.563 --> 24:07.698
but I'll settle for your job.

24:07.732 --> 24:09.366
You want to go to war with me?

24:09.400 --> 24:10.601
You think that's a good idea?

24:10.635 --> 24:12.536
I haven't even
gotten started yet.

24:12.570 --> 24:15.706
Pfizer has a $10 million
account with Galweather.

24:15.740 --> 24:17.174
I'm sorry... <i>had.</i>

24:17.208 --> 24:19.376
Had a $10 million account.

24:19.411 --> 24:20.811
That's gone.

24:20.870 --> 24:22.671
Todd Walton, your
account rep at Pfizer?

24:23.181 --> 24:25.074
We went to Wharton
together, so...

24:25.108 --> 24:26.509
He's a very nice guy.

24:26.543 --> 24:29.045
Hates you.

24:29.079 --> 24:30.914
How happy do you think
he's going to be

24:30.948 --> 24:34.084
when he gets to tell Norbert
you lost that account?

24:34.118 --> 24:36.186
Good luck getting a job
at a fucking Radio Shack,

24:36.221 --> 24:38.622
once your merger goes through.

25:06.384 --> 25:07.885
So...

25:07.920 --> 25:09.287
Did you miss me?

25:09.321 --> 25:11.756
You know I did.-

25:13.759 --> 25:15.059
So?

25:15.094 --> 25:18.096
So, you know how it
is on the road.

25:18.130 --> 25:19.731
Temptation everywhere.

25:19.765 --> 25:21.433
And you know how I am.

25:21.467 --> 25:26.137
It's okay. That's what
condoms are for.

25:26.171 --> 25:27.738
I'll go get one.

25:27.773 --> 25:29.940
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

25:31.243 --> 25:33.243
That's not gonna be necessary.

25:35.780 --> 25:38.482
All aboard the train...

25:38.517 --> 25:41.452
- to Bareback Town!
- Yee-hah!

25:42.855 --> 25:44.656
...it's like eating snails.

25:45.958 --> 25:47.726
No, okra's okay.
I hated okra!

25:47.760 --> 25:50.129
Hate it okra.
Still hate okra.

25:55.969 --> 25:58.604
You know it turns me on
when you play hard-to-get.

25:58.638 --> 26:00.105
Monica...

26:00.140 --> 26:01.874
- Really?
- Absolutely.

26:01.908 --> 26:03.575
Hi, Mom.

26:05.011 --> 26:08.880
Sorry.
How Norman Rockwell of you all.

26:08.914 --> 26:10.481
Want some mac 'n' cheese?

26:10.516 --> 26:11.983
April made dinner again.

26:12.017 --> 26:13.784
No, thanks.

26:13.819 --> 26:16.153
I will come back
another time, darling.

26:18.757 --> 26:20.125
Say good night to Mom.

26:20.159 --> 26:21.927
Night, Mom.

26:28.001 --> 26:30.403
Be expecting a call
from my lawyers.

26:30.438 --> 26:32.806
I want custody of Roscoe.
