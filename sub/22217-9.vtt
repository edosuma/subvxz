_

00:05.659 --> 00:08.560
_

00:08.562 --> 00:10.581
I'll handle it. I always do.

00:10.616 --> 00:11.997
<i>I'll get her the money to relocate.</i>

00:11.999 --> 00:14.399
If anything happens to her,
it is your fault.

00:14.401 --> 00:16.768
I need you to find out all
you can about her sister,

00:16.770 --> 00:18.203
Iris Machado.

00:18.205 --> 00:19.704
You were trying to get over Culhane,

00:19.706 --> 00:21.306
and it was harder than you thought.

00:21.308 --> 00:22.707
Didn't you say that we should keep this

00:22.709 --> 00:24.109
strictly business?

00:24.111 --> 00:25.610
We're at work, aren't we?

00:25.612 --> 00:26.945
Ted, hi.

00:26.947 --> 00:27.979
<i>I'd love to see you.</i>

00:27.981 --> 00:29.514
<i>Can be in New York in three hours.</i>

_

01:28.047 --> 01:28.858
Hey.

01:28.893 --> 01:30.374
Liberace?

01:32.649 --> 01:34.148
Grandpa?

01:34.150 --> 01:37.018
Wipe your nose and put on some pants.

01:37.020 --> 01:38.653
I'm taking you home.

01:42.892 --> 01:46.227
So, did you read our year-end report?

01:47.530 --> 01:48.796
I should've learned by now.

01:48.798 --> 01:50.965
Discussing dividends is your version

01:50.967 --> 01:52.667
of an after-sex cigarette.

01:52.669 --> 01:55.002
At least you've moved past the

01:55.004 --> 01:57.038
"this is the last time we do it" speech.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.440
No, this really is the last time.

01:58.542 --> 02:00.575
I don't want people thinking
we're only in business together

02:00.577 --> 02:01.910
because we share a bed.

02:01.912 --> 02:03.178
You mean a couch.

02:03.180 --> 02:04.379
Or that desk.

02:04.381 --> 02:06.081
Or the sink.

02:06.083 --> 02:07.415
The only time we leave the office

02:07.417 --> 02:09.116
is to do it on the balcony.

02:09.119 --> 02:11.886
Well, had you read the report,
you'd understand why.

02:11.888 --> 02:13.822
We're not profitable yet.

02:13.824 --> 02:17.025
And this... isn't helping.

02:17.820 --> 02:19.135
Isn't it?

02:21.274 --> 02:22.831
My mom will be here any minute.

02:22.833 --> 02:25.533
I can't believe I get to spend
the holidays with family.

02:25.535 --> 02:26.901
What, so I'm not family?

02:26.903 --> 02:28.336
I mean the two of you.

02:28.338 --> 02:29.938
Aren't you excited to see your sister?

02:30.873 --> 02:31.840
Of course.

02:31.842 --> 02:34.709
Look, I know it's been a long time,
but we're Machados, TÃ­a.

02:34.711 --> 02:37.011
Okay? We pick up where we left off.

02:37.593 --> 02:38.313
Like this.

02:41.218 --> 02:43.485
Oh. I thought you were my mom.

02:43.487 --> 02:45.887
If I'd raised you,
you wouldn't be wearing that shirt.

02:47.344 --> 02:48.089
So...

02:48.091 --> 02:49.657
The year-end report.

02:49.659 --> 02:51.826
You know, we're a first-year company.

02:51.828 --> 02:53.762
We're expected to end in the red.

02:53.764 --> 02:56.164
When do I ever aim for the expected?

03:00.539 --> 03:01.369
What's wrong?

03:01.371 --> 03:03.705
Did Barneys run out
of turtlenecks again?

03:04.206 --> 03:06.674
Monica.
She's bailing on me for Christmas.

03:06.676 --> 03:08.910
Well, only fair after you
ditched her on Thanksgiving

03:08.912 --> 03:10.111
for that mystery woman.

03:10.727 --> 03:12.647
So... who was she?

03:12.649 --> 03:14.282
Name, age, weight?

03:15.160 --> 03:18.219
Come on. You know about my past,
why can't I know about yours?

03:18.221 --> 03:21.289
There was never another woman, Fallon.

03:21.291 --> 03:23.558
I was visiting my dad in prison.

03:24.832 --> 03:26.094
But I thought you cut ties with him.

03:26.096 --> 03:28.263
I'm trying to sew them back together.

03:28.265 --> 03:32.167
And, because of that,
Monica's giving me the cold shoulder.

03:32.169 --> 03:35.770
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

03:36.514 --> 03:37.539
I hope she'll come around.

03:37.541 --> 03:40.241
That's about as likely as you
getting us out of the red.

03:40.243 --> 03:42.076
'Tis the season for miracles.

03:42.078 --> 03:43.478
Mmm.

03:49.786 --> 03:51.519
So is your mom as pretty as your aunt?

03:51.521 --> 03:52.687
Gross.

03:52.689 --> 03:54.489
What?

03:55.992 --> 03:58.059
Intervention or surprise party?

03:58.061 --> 03:59.494
Welcome wagon, actually.

04:00.288 --> 04:01.196
Not for you.

04:01.198 --> 04:04.165
Thank God. I was afraid I was
gonna have to act grateful.

04:04.167 --> 04:05.934
My sister's on her way.

04:05.936 --> 04:07.873
Oh, goody. Santa got me what I wanted.

04:07.908 --> 04:09.637
- Another Cristal.
- Fallon.

04:09.639 --> 04:11.840
Best behavior.

04:16.245 --> 04:17.478
- Oh.
- Are you kidding me?

04:17.481 --> 04:19.414
I'm sorry to disappoint.

04:19.416 --> 04:22.817
But I believe this is
who you're waiting for.

04:22.819 --> 04:23.985
<i>Feliz Navidad.</i>

04:23.987 --> 04:25.253
Mami.

04:25.255 --> 04:27.088
<i>Oh, mi hijo bello.</i>

04:31.033 --> 04:33.923
_

04:37.834 --> 04:40.802
So, this is where you live, huh?

04:40.804 --> 04:43.671
Oh, the ride up the driveway
was longer than my flight.

04:43.673 --> 04:46.341
And who puts a pool next to a lake?

04:46.343 --> 04:47.609
This guy.

04:47.611 --> 04:50.979
- Hi.
- Blake Carrington.

04:50.981 --> 04:52.847
Thank you so much for everything.

04:52.849 --> 04:55.517
The invitation, those little sandwiches

04:55.519 --> 04:56.918
on your fancy plane.

04:56.920 --> 04:58.152
Mami, this is, uh...

04:58.154 --> 05:00.388
Fallon. I've heard about you.

05:00.390 --> 05:02.290
I can only imagine.

05:02.292 --> 05:03.691
Oh.

05:03.693 --> 05:05.693
Must be nice having
your mom for Christmas.

05:05.695 --> 05:07.495
Best gift anyone can give is family.

05:07.497 --> 05:11.232
Yes. Other than a trust
fund and personal space.

05:11.912 --> 05:15.336
Okay, Google,
how do I say "space" in Spanish?

05:15.338 --> 05:17.839
<i>- Espacio.</i>
- Okay, we got it.

05:17.841 --> 05:19.140
If you'll follow me,
I've had Mrs. Gunnerson

05:19.142 --> 05:20.508
arrange lunch for you.

05:20.510 --> 05:23.278
Double helpings,
in case mother eats like son.

05:25.849 --> 05:27.415
And you've hidden the silverware?

05:27.417 --> 05:28.917
All locked away.

05:28.919 --> 05:30.685
Ho, ho, ho.

05:30.687 --> 05:32.587
- Dad?
- Grandpa?

05:32.589 --> 05:34.122
I come bearing gifts.

05:35.258 --> 05:37.559
At least, I'm returning one.

05:37.561 --> 05:39.727
It's the thought that counts, right?

05:39.729 --> 05:42.096
Steven.

05:43.400 --> 05:44.599
How was New York?

05:44.601 --> 05:46.234
Any good meetings?

05:46.236 --> 05:48.903
I'm sure Grandpa will fill you in.

05:48.905 --> 05:51.906
He's exhausted from his little jaunt.

05:51.908 --> 05:53.074
You know, harsh weather.

05:53.076 --> 05:56.244
All that snow.

05:58.341 --> 05:59.647
Am I in the right house?

05:59.649 --> 06:01.015
If I'd have known you were coming,
I would've...

06:01.017 --> 06:02.717
You would've hidden the undocumented?

06:03.419 --> 06:06.688
- Thomas, so nice to finally meet you.
- Thank you.

06:06.690 --> 06:08.990
Hey... this is my wife, Cristal.

06:09.671 --> 06:10.959
If you'd come to the wedding,
you would've met her.

06:10.961 --> 06:12.493
I did come to your wedding.

06:12.495 --> 06:14.762
The one that wasn't for a green card.

06:14.764 --> 06:16.030
Okay.

06:16.032 --> 06:19.000
Let's get lunch started, shall we?

06:19.002 --> 06:20.435
How's my favorite grandchild?

06:20.437 --> 06:21.636
Busy building an empire.

06:22.485 --> 06:23.271
That's my girl.

06:23.273 --> 06:24.872
- Actually, my girl.
- Well, she was your girl

06:24.874 --> 06:26.808
until you let her go
and leave my company.

06:26.810 --> 06:28.042
Actually, my company.

06:28.044 --> 06:30.011
I'm glad you're here, Grandpa.

06:30.013 --> 06:32.213
Thank you.

06:34.117 --> 06:35.450
We need to talk.

06:46.429 --> 06:48.196
Oh, son of a bitch.

06:48.198 --> 06:49.697
Is that cocaine?

06:49.699 --> 06:53.001
Your boy was humping
everyone in New York City,

06:53.003 --> 06:55.136
save the Statue of Liberty,

06:55.138 --> 06:56.904
but I bet if she wore pants...

06:57.513 --> 06:59.040
What, you're spying on my family now?

06:59.042 --> 07:00.642
No, the tabloids are.

07:00.644 --> 07:04.479
My contact reached out,
and I paid to have it killed.

07:04.481 --> 07:06.914
I can't imagine what
another scandal would do

07:06.916 --> 07:08.116
to Carrington Atlantic.

07:08.118 --> 07:10.730
A company that I handed you

07:10.765 --> 07:13.454
because I thought you
were ready to lead it.

07:13.456 --> 07:14.922
I have been running a
tight ship for a long time,

07:14.924 --> 07:15.957
and you know it.

07:15.959 --> 07:17.158
Yeah, what ship would that be?

07:17.160 --> 07:18.359
The <i> Titanic?</i>

07:18.361 --> 07:20.294
You have a new COO

07:20.296 --> 07:21.896
who shared her naughty bits in public,

07:21.898 --> 07:25.284
you were in the middle of
a murder investigation,

07:25.319 --> 07:28.336
and you lost my
granddaughter to Jeff Colby.

07:28.338 --> 07:32.540
Now your son's a
drug-addicted liability.

07:34.077 --> 07:36.611
I want you to fire Steven immediately.

07:36.613 --> 07:38.513
- Oh, how is that gonna help?
- Well, if he's going to get caught,

07:38.515 --> 07:41.816
he won't get caught as the head
of the Carrington Foundation.

07:41.818 --> 07:43.484
I'm not firing my son.

07:43.486 --> 07:46.220
I'll handle him in my own way,
like a father would.

07:46.222 --> 07:48.256
Not that you would know
anything about that.

07:48.258 --> 07:52.160
Well, I'm, I'm sorry,
that you thought that was a suggestion.

07:52.162 --> 07:55.709
I want you to fire Steven,
and if you don't,

07:55.744 --> 07:58.599
I'll contact the board
and have them fire you.

08:08.887 --> 08:12.081
Dad, I'm sorry.
No one is more embarrassed

08:12.121 --> 08:14.521
or concerned than I am.

08:14.523 --> 08:15.356
It was a slip.

08:15.378 --> 08:17.878
And I am ready to forget
all about New York

08:17.880 --> 08:20.748
and just focus on work.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.583
That's not what I want you to do.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.553
I don't want you to
forget what happened.

08:26.555 --> 08:28.288
I want you to get the help you need.

08:28.290 --> 08:30.657
What, like rehab?

08:30.659 --> 08:31.859
Fine.

08:31.861 --> 08:33.626
Yes, I will go.

08:33.629 --> 08:36.096
If that's what it'll take
for you to trust me again.

08:36.097 --> 08:38.032
That's a start.

08:38.849 --> 08:40.835
Why don't you join your
grandfather and me downstairs?

08:40.904 --> 08:43.102
Uh, you're on your own there.

08:54.549 --> 08:55.916
Frank, hi.

08:55.918 --> 08:57.818
I'm expecting someone at the west gate.

08:57.820 --> 09:00.854
Can you ring me when they get here?

09:07.129 --> 09:09.530
I take it you saw my budget proposal.

09:09.532 --> 09:11.498
This isn't a proposal, it's a bloodbath.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.668
I'm not laying off two-thirds
of my people before Christmas.

09:14.670 --> 09:16.336
Oh, well, we can wait until the 26th.

09:16.338 --> 09:17.504
I'm serious, Fallon.

09:17.506 --> 09:18.605
Well, so am I.

09:18.607 --> 09:19.740
I'm only trimming the fat

09:19.742 --> 09:21.041
because we have a balance
sheet to consider.

09:21.043 --> 09:22.443
Scrooge would have done it.

09:22.445 --> 09:25.312
I think you missed the
point of that story.

09:25.314 --> 09:28.215
No company of mine will ever
put profits over people.

09:28.217 --> 09:29.186
End of discussion.

09:29.218 --> 09:31.385
Bah, humbug. But don't worry.

09:31.387 --> 09:34.221
I'm working on another angle.

09:44.366 --> 09:47.234
Damn, the Carringtons really
do keep you around the clock.

09:47.236 --> 09:50.104
Yeah, well,
the end-of-the-year bonus is worth it.

09:50.106 --> 09:51.805
Am I driving you and Fallon today?

09:51.807 --> 09:53.173
'Cause she didn't tell
me anything about that.

09:53.175 --> 09:54.641
Well, that makes two of us.

09:54.643 --> 09:57.077
She just said she was
taking me shopping.

09:57.079 --> 09:59.546
Kori told me about your breakup.

09:59.548 --> 10:00.781
I'm sorry to hear it.

10:00.783 --> 10:02.082
Yeah, well, it's my fault.

10:02.084 --> 10:03.417
I thought it was Fallon's.

10:03.419 --> 10:05.119
Mm. No, I make my own choices.

10:05.121 --> 10:06.653
Does Fallon know that?

10:08.624 --> 10:10.390
I'm driving myself today.

10:10.392 --> 10:12.860
That way you won't be stuck
with us if I take too long.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.261
You're too kind.

10:17.066 --> 10:19.266
I can even get my own door.

10:22.371 --> 10:25.439
Not sure where his holiday spirit is.

10:25.441 --> 10:26.974
It's not like he's lonely.

10:27.966 --> 10:29.176
Are you?

10:30.124 --> 10:31.178
I'm fine.

10:31.180 --> 10:32.646
I'm evolving.

10:33.134 --> 10:34.581
That's mature.

10:35.224 --> 10:37.518
It's a pain in the ass.

10:45.109 --> 10:48.095
I bet you're thinking,
"Could've been me", right?

10:50.317 --> 10:54.868
So, Iris,
Cristal tells me it's been 12 years

10:54.870 --> 10:56.303
since you've seen each other?

10:56.305 --> 10:58.003
And six since I've seen my boy.

10:58.074 --> 11:01.041
I couldn't manage being
away from my kids that long.

11:01.043 --> 11:02.228
You do what it takes.

11:02.279 --> 11:04.811
Actually, Thomas, I regret it.

11:04.813 --> 11:09.850
I regret every day that I
wasn't around to see my son

11:09.852 --> 11:12.786
become this amazing,
beautiful, young man.

11:12.788 --> 11:14.188
Oh, stop it.

11:14.190 --> 11:15.622
But, like, don't.

11:16.094 --> 11:18.091
I won't make that mistake again.

11:18.093 --> 11:19.359
I want to stay in America.

11:19.361 --> 11:20.894
- What?
- What?

11:20.896 --> 11:24.231
Maybe I'll apply for a job
at Carrington Atlantic.

11:24.647 --> 11:25.832
Smart move.

11:25.834 --> 11:28.035
I hear they're taking anyone these days.

11:28.037 --> 11:29.937
I'm hoping you have some pull.

11:30.402 --> 11:32.906
I could move here
legally on a work visa,

11:32.908 --> 11:36.376
stop depending on Cristal's
money and your kindness, Blake.

11:36.378 --> 11:38.245
I like to work hard for what I have.

11:38.247 --> 11:39.913
I can type.

11:39.915 --> 11:42.349
I'm good on the phone.

11:42.351 --> 11:45.219
Anyway, it's just an idea.

11:45.221 --> 11:47.221
Not that you've given
it a lot of thought.

11:47.223 --> 11:48.482
Obviously.

11:48.524 --> 11:51.124
Well, I'd have to run it by the COO.

11:54.373 --> 11:55.662
I can't do it.

11:55.664 --> 11:57.164
I can't believe you lied to me.

11:57.166 --> 11:57.937
Oh, yeah, I know.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.900
No one should ever lie about shopping.

11:59.902 --> 12:01.134
I knew if you had

12:01.136 --> 12:03.136
too much time to think about it,
you wouldn't come.

12:03.138 --> 12:05.772
- I'm barely here now.
- Well, you have to stay.

12:05.774 --> 12:07.708
I mean, I even called up
ahead to set up a visit.

12:07.710 --> 12:08.709
- Fallon.
- When I saw Cristal

12:08.711 --> 12:10.978
and her Sears catalog family,

12:10.980 --> 12:13.046
they just seemed so
happy to be reunited.

12:13.048 --> 12:14.681
And I know that Jeff was
crushed when he heard

12:14.683 --> 12:16.283
you were bailing on your
family for Christmas.

12:16.285 --> 12:18.018
I can't believe Jeff told you.

12:18.020 --> 12:20.487
- That wasn't his decision to make.
- Don't be mad at him.

12:20.489 --> 12:22.889
I just know that when my
dad shut me out for a week,

12:22.891 --> 12:25.262
I couldn't stand it. I can't imagine
losing him for ten years.

12:25.294 --> 12:28.996
That's right. You can't imagine.

12:28.998 --> 12:30.964
- Mommy.
- Shh.

12:30.966 --> 12:33.533
Prisoner 2F529.

12:33.535 --> 12:34.434
Ready for you.

12:34.436 --> 12:36.136
No.

12:36.138 --> 12:38.905
Look, this was your idea.

12:38.907 --> 12:40.941
You go see the bastard yourself.
I'm out.

12:42.076 --> 12:44.911
No! No!

12:54.290 --> 12:55.956
Did anyone see you come in?

12:55.958 --> 12:57.724
Yeah, just that guy Frank at the gate.

12:57.726 --> 12:59.893
He's an old friend and my drug hookup,

12:59.895 --> 13:02.029
so his lips are sealed.

13:03.832 --> 13:06.233
So, uh, where are we going?

13:06.235 --> 13:09.002
Oh, Betty Ford, allegedly,

13:09.004 --> 13:12.706
but pick a place on Earth
and that's where we'll be.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.676
My friend, Jeff, offered us his
plane so we won't have to deal

13:15.678 --> 13:17.311
with airport security or my father.

13:18.147 --> 13:19.846
Paris for New Year's?

13:41.807 --> 13:45.272
Not every day some Buckhead
Betty rolls up in here.

13:45.274 --> 13:46.306
You lonely, honey?

13:46.874 --> 13:48.542
I'm sorry to disappoint,

13:48.544 --> 13:50.310
but I'm not one of those crazy nutjobs

13:50.312 --> 13:51.878
who falls for guys in prison.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.649
Cute jacket.

13:55.651 --> 13:57.384
So, you mind telling me
what this is all about then?

13:57.386 --> 13:59.386
I'm a close friend of Jeff and Monica's.

13:59.388 --> 14:01.188
She was actually coming
here to visit you today.

14:01.190 --> 14:02.255
Why?

14:02.257 --> 14:04.024
Well, she is your daughter.

14:04.026 --> 14:05.425
And she's not welcome here.

14:07.796 --> 14:10.797
You know, people say I'm the
one that convinced Chelsea

14:10.799 --> 14:13.367
and Ivanka to make up,
so I'm sure I can negotiate a treaty

14:13.369 --> 14:15.802
- between you and Monica.
- I'm sorry, but who the hell are you?

14:15.804 --> 14:17.604
Well, I'm her friend. Fallon Carrington.

14:18.937 --> 14:20.140
You're Blake's daughter.

14:20.142 --> 14:21.808
No. He's my father.

14:21.811 --> 14:25.078
- It's just I've known Jeff and Monica since...
- Get out.

14:25.080 --> 14:26.747
- Get the hell out.
- Let's go.

14:26.749 --> 14:29.082
Get your ass out of here!
Never come back again, you hear me?

14:29.084 --> 14:31.385
And stay away from my kids!

14:41.713 --> 14:42.513
Wait, is that...

14:45.802 --> 14:46.884
TÃ­a, you have to see this.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.120
It's an album that my mom
brought from when you were kids.

14:49.522 --> 14:50.855
I can't believe you have all these.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.223
Why would you do that?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.624
Asking Blake for a job?

14:53.626 --> 14:55.059
How could you?

14:55.061 --> 14:56.861
I didn't ask him for your job.

14:56.863 --> 14:59.585
Because you couldn't
do my job or any job.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.966
As if you know anything about me.

15:01.968 --> 15:03.734
After you left, you barely looked back.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.070
You don't know what I did for money.

15:06.072 --> 15:08.572
I can certainly handle
a simple secretary job.

15:08.574 --> 15:09.940
Secretarial.

15:09.942 --> 15:11.442
Oh, my God, who cares?

15:11.444 --> 15:13.277
Point is, if she got work,
she could stay.

15:13.279 --> 15:14.912
- No, she can't.
- Why?

15:14.914 --> 15:15.989
We just got her here.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.782
She's been on the run for 12
years for money you both stole.

15:18.784 --> 15:21.085
Look at the life you got.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.720
I can't go back to Venezuela.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.655
I can't.

15:24.657 --> 15:27.057
I just want to start over like you did,

15:27.059 --> 15:29.260
here, with my son.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.630
Why is that so hard
for you to understand?

15:34.248 --> 15:35.666
She doesn't want your life.

15:35.668 --> 15:37.334
She just wants us.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.447
Have you handled Steven yet?

15:51.518 --> 15:52.750
Timing's crucial, son.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.985
We can bury the news
during the holiday season

15:54.987 --> 15:57.021
when the news cycle slows down.

15:57.023 --> 15:59.156
That won't be necessary.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.157
He slipped,

16:00.159 --> 16:01.225
he knows he's wrong,

16:01.227 --> 16:02.860
and he assured me he'll go to rehab.

16:02.862 --> 16:05.062
I didn't raise you to be a fool, Blake.

16:06.899 --> 16:08.265
And you didn't raise my son.

16:08.267 --> 16:10.034
I know him.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.502
I know how to get through to him

16:11.504 --> 16:12.836
and he understands my concerns.

16:12.838 --> 16:14.071
Believe it or not,

16:14.073 --> 16:15.906
it'll work better than your approach.

16:15.908 --> 16:17.708
- You'll see.
- Really?

16:17.710 --> 16:19.743
Nobody has to be fired.

16:25.221 --> 16:28.118
Well, tell that to the Ken doll
sneaking out of the east wing.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.563
Something wrong with the front door?

16:40.460 --> 16:41.832
It was you, wasn't it?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.634
You dragged him with you to New York.

16:43.636 --> 16:45.269
Steven came to me.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.071
Look, you know he doesn't do
anything he doesn't want...

16:47.073 --> 16:48.105
This wouldn't have happened

16:48.107 --> 16:49.406
if you hadn't come back into his life.

16:49.408 --> 16:51.141
What's it gonna be?

16:52.203 --> 16:53.677
Will 50 grand do it this time?

16:53.679 --> 16:56.580
Ah, there's the Blake Carrington I know.

16:56.582 --> 16:59.083
Yeah, he doesn't get his way,
he throws money at the problem.

16:59.085 --> 17:01.854
You know what?
How about that or this golf club?

17:01.889 --> 17:02.920
You pick.

17:04.002 --> 17:06.056
Mr. Carrington,

17:06.058 --> 17:08.192
you know what the
first step of rehab is?

17:08.194 --> 17:11.395
It's finally admitting
that you're powerless.

17:21.641 --> 17:22.973
You told Fallon?

17:22.974 --> 17:24.575
What are you talking about?

17:24.577 --> 17:26.377
Your little business partner
just took me on a field trip

17:26.378 --> 17:28.078
to Atlanta North State Correctional.

17:28.739 --> 17:30.848
You know how messed up things
are between Dad and me.

17:30.850 --> 17:32.650
You know I don't want
that out in the world.

17:32.652 --> 17:33.784
I didn't tell the world

17:33.786 --> 17:35.819
and I wasn't trying to hurt you.

17:35.821 --> 17:37.621
Fallon was asking me about it.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.256
She thought I was with some girl, so...

17:39.258 --> 17:40.824
Who cares?

17:42.857 --> 17:44.662
Oh, my God, you're sleeping with her?

17:44.664 --> 17:47.197
So, I have bad news.

17:47.199 --> 17:49.466
Looks like you already know it.

17:49.468 --> 17:50.968
I'm sorry, okay?

17:50.970 --> 17:53.003
I-I-I didn't mean to put
you in an awkward position.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.272
By bringing me to see my dad
or by screwing my brother?

17:55.274 --> 17:56.440
Monica, please.

17:56.442 --> 17:57.608
It's not a big deal.

17:57.610 --> 17:59.243
We agreed to keep it low-key

17:59.245 --> 18:00.577
to avoid drama.

18:00.579 --> 18:02.012
We agreed not to tell anyone about Dad.

18:02.014 --> 18:03.847
Guess low-key isn't your strong suit.

18:03.849 --> 18:06.850
I understand you're upset,
but I'm a grown-ass man, Monica.

18:06.852 --> 18:08.385
I don't need you vetting
who I sleep with.

18:08.387 --> 18:09.953
It's not like you listen, anyway.

18:09.955 --> 18:12.256
Luckily, she'll soon be back
with her boy toy driver,

18:12.258 --> 18:13.424
now that he's single.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.858
Culhane broke up with Kori?

18:14.860 --> 18:17.795
Obviously, he didn't tell you.

18:17.797 --> 18:19.830
Maybe 'cause he's learned
to avoid all her drama.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.399
Why haven't we?

18:29.742 --> 18:32.543
Homemade alfajores.

18:32.545 --> 18:35.145
I figured the olive branch
could use an upgrade.

18:35.147 --> 18:38.148
So, you made those... treats?

18:38.150 --> 18:43.087
I thought Mrs. Gunnerson had
some sort of psychotic break.

18:44.657 --> 18:46.857
Oh.

18:50.134 --> 18:52.066
Healthy sum for a peasant.

18:52.101 --> 18:53.497
She's not a peasant.

18:53.499 --> 18:56.066
And that's probably the last
of the money that I sent her.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.768
American cash is king in Venezuela.

18:57.770 --> 19:02.072
This particular cash
has been marked by me

19:02.074 --> 19:03.674
in case those fish-head
goons we paid off

19:03.676 --> 19:04.908
come back and cause trouble.

19:04.910 --> 19:06.009
But how would she have
gotten that money?

19:06.011 --> 19:08.512
I don't under...

19:09.942 --> 19:11.682
My own sister tried to rob me.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.984
Must be genetic.

19:17.711 --> 19:20.584
Threats, extortion, blackmail.

19:20.586 --> 19:22.485
I can't believe Iris would do this.

19:23.116 --> 19:23.920
Between the two of you,

19:23.922 --> 19:27.057
is there a commandment
you haven't broken?

19:27.059 --> 19:30.227
The literal buck,
as they say, stops here.

19:30.229 --> 19:31.962
We are taking this to Blake.

19:31.964 --> 19:34.130
No. I'm going to my sister first.

19:34.132 --> 19:36.233
I just need time to
think things through.

19:36.235 --> 19:37.801
Time just helps her.

19:37.803 --> 19:40.570
If she really scammed us for $300,000,

19:40.572 --> 19:42.272
who's to say she's finished?

19:42.274 --> 19:44.274
I'm not letting her leave with a dime.

19:44.276 --> 19:45.609
But, please, Anders,

19:45.611 --> 19:47.410
you have to let me handle
this myself this time.

19:48.194 --> 19:49.446
Oh, I miss the old days

19:49.448 --> 19:52.215
when all you had was a dead ex-lover.

19:53.952 --> 19:56.720
In my defense, I didn't know
your dad had a problem with her.

19:56.722 --> 19:58.955
You kind of left out that
critical information.

19:58.957 --> 20:00.590
If I'd have thought
you were gonna do that,

20:00.592 --> 20:02.692
I'd have kept lying about
my imaginary girlfriend.

20:02.694 --> 20:04.194
Was it so hard to believe

20:04.196 --> 20:05.729
I'd want to do something
nice for you and Monica?

20:06.498 --> 20:08.665
Well, and me, but mostly you.

20:08.667 --> 20:10.400
I mean, after you told me
about your father,

20:10.402 --> 20:12.802
I also started thinking about prisons.

20:12.804 --> 20:16.406
Those things are open
24/7, 365 days a year,

20:16.408 --> 20:18.275
and they need power.

20:18.277 --> 20:19.676
So I called to set a meeting

20:19.678 --> 20:21.478
with the Atlanta operations manager

20:21.480 --> 20:24.314
who oversees where your dad is,
but he wouldn't take my call.

20:24.316 --> 20:26.349
That's why you took Monica with you?

20:26.351 --> 20:27.751
To stage a run-in?

20:27.753 --> 20:29.552
Well, I needed
a visitor's badge to get in.

20:29.554 --> 20:31.154
I figured I would find
the operations manager

20:31.156 --> 20:32.289
while she was with your dad.

20:32.291 --> 20:33.823
You know, two birds, one stone.

20:33.825 --> 20:37.027
Fix your family and fix
our books with a new deal.

20:37.029 --> 20:39.262
But when Monica bailed,
I had to explain to your dad

20:39.264 --> 20:41.031
what happened and I missed the guy.

20:41.033 --> 20:43.833
So, now my dad and my sister
are both pissed at me,

20:43.835 --> 20:46.403
and we're still in the red.

20:46.405 --> 20:48.171
Look, I will fix it, okay?

20:48.173 --> 20:50.340
I promise.

20:50.342 --> 20:52.842
That isn't for me, is it?

20:54.716 --> 20:56.179
Not that you deserve it.

20:57.791 --> 20:59.249
No.

20:59.251 --> 21:02.018
No, you're right. I don't.

21:06.825 --> 21:09.225
Don't open it until Christmas.

21:12.164 --> 21:13.930
- Hello?
- You have a collect call

21:13.932 --> 21:15.098
from Fulton County Jail.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.833
Do you wish to accept the charges?

21:16.835 --> 21:18.935
Uh... uh, yeah, sure.

21:19.983 --> 21:22.272
Ah, Steven, thank God. It's Ted.

21:22.937 --> 21:23.807
I'm in jail.

21:24.362 --> 21:25.508
Why? What the hell happened?

21:25.510 --> 21:27.811
I got pulled over as soon
as I left your house.

21:27.813 --> 21:29.446
Look, they said
they found drugs in my car,

21:29.448 --> 21:31.448
and now they're trying to
charge me with possession.

21:31.450 --> 21:32.682
How much were you carrying?

21:32.684 --> 21:34.451
Nothing. Someone planted it.

21:35.822 --> 21:38.054
Steven, this is my third strike.

21:38.056 --> 21:39.656
I could get real time.

21:40.692 --> 21:44.060
Look, you still know people, don't you?

21:46.998 --> 21:48.714
Even if I wanted to help,

21:48.749 --> 21:49.599
I can't.

21:51.370 --> 21:52.602
You pushed my contact out of the force.

21:52.604 --> 21:54.871
Hell, out of the country.

21:55.393 --> 21:58.019
Ted Dinard can rot in
prison for all I care.

21:58.656 --> 22:00.677
You did this, didn't you?

22:00.679 --> 22:02.218
You called the cops.

22:02.253 --> 22:04.147
Please, that's beneath me, Steven.

22:04.149 --> 22:05.682
All of a sudden there's
a line you won't cross?

22:05.684 --> 22:06.716
All of a sudden, I don't have somebody

22:06.718 --> 22:08.376
to cross it for me.

22:08.411 --> 22:09.552
The only person that could

22:09.554 --> 22:11.254
get this done for me is
enjoying early retirement

22:11.256 --> 22:13.623
in the Caribbean, thanks to you.

22:13.625 --> 22:15.692
Good news...

22:15.694 --> 22:19.329
you don't need to worry about
when you're gonna see Ted again.

22:19.331 --> 22:22.032
I have a feeling he's gonna
be in Atlanta for a while.

22:25.820 --> 22:26.736
Wow.

22:26.771 --> 22:29.739
Someone's feeling generous.

22:30.220 --> 22:33.543
Where'd you get the money
to buy all the presents?

22:33.545 --> 22:35.158
I saved up a little.

22:35.214 --> 22:37.313
A little as in $300,000?

22:39.947 --> 22:40.650
Why do you have the money

22:40.652 --> 22:42.819
I gave the blackmailers in your purse?

22:45.481 --> 22:47.090
It was you.

22:47.092 --> 22:49.392
I thought you'd come
up with a lazy excuse,

22:49.394 --> 22:50.827
but you didn't even bother.

22:51.686 --> 22:53.096
You told me

22:53.098 --> 22:55.065
it was getting complicated
to send money every month.

22:55.067 --> 22:57.200
So you forced me to give
it to you all at once

22:57.202 --> 22:58.635
by pretending you're in danger?

22:58.637 --> 23:01.538
It's the only way I knew you cared.

23:01.540 --> 23:04.307
12 years I've been on my own.

23:04.309 --> 23:06.876
I lost faith in people,
especially the ones

23:06.878 --> 23:08.445
with enough money to buy a new name,

23:08.447 --> 23:11.047
a new life, a new family.

23:11.049 --> 23:12.282
Were you ever in danger?

23:12.284 --> 23:14.551
I ran from those men for seven years.

23:14.553 --> 23:16.553
And the other five?

23:16.555 --> 23:18.221
You took advantage of our past

23:18.223 --> 23:19.522
and made me think we were at risk

23:19.524 --> 23:21.424
after all that I've done for you.

23:21.426 --> 23:22.692
After all you did?

23:22.694 --> 23:25.095
You were living the good life in America

23:25.097 --> 23:27.497
while I was struggling in Venezuela.

23:27.499 --> 23:29.432
I thought you would never
miss a few extra dollars,

23:29.434 --> 23:32.001
and guess what... I was right.

23:32.003 --> 23:34.571
You have no idea how hard
I worked for that money.

23:34.573 --> 23:36.739
The hours I stayed up
late at night worrying

23:36.741 --> 23:38.708
that Alejandro's bosses were after you.

23:38.710 --> 23:40.643
I want you out of here.

23:40.645 --> 23:43.680
On a flight out of Atlanta,
out of our lives.

23:43.682 --> 23:45.815
You think you can just push me out?

23:45.817 --> 23:47.951
- This is my house.
- No, this is Blake's house.

23:48.951 --> 23:51.354
And I know you didn't
really tell him everything,

23:51.356 --> 23:53.957
or Sam wouldn't be here.

23:54.993 --> 23:58.161
If I tell your husband
what really happened,

23:58.163 --> 24:01.064
who do you think will be
on a flight out of Atlanta?

24:02.134 --> 24:03.600
Don't test me, Celia,

24:03.602 --> 24:08.371
or I promise you,
I will tell him everything.

24:26.087 --> 24:29.022
Heard about your tiff with Steven.

24:29.024 --> 24:31.324
Anders' loyalties really do shift

24:31.326 --> 24:32.625
whenever you're home.

24:32.627 --> 24:34.327
Don't know how you
got that boy arrested,

24:34.329 --> 24:38.164
but I'm proud of you for
solving that problem.

24:38.166 --> 24:40.133
I didn't fire Steven.

24:40.135 --> 24:42.202
Oh, you did one better.
Firing him would have

24:42.204 --> 24:43.837
just been a Band-Aid.

24:43.839 --> 24:46.039
You cut out the boil by the root.

24:46.834 --> 24:49.409
Unexpected and efficient.

24:49.411 --> 24:52.045
You keep your job for now.

24:55.217 --> 24:56.649
What do you mean they can't release him

24:56.651 --> 24:58.885
until after the holidays?

24:58.887 --> 25:02.555
I know it's Christmas,
but if you're on a retainer, then...

25:02.557 --> 25:05.792
I'll pay overtime...
Just make sure my friend is out.

25:17.606 --> 25:19.305
What's up with you?

25:19.307 --> 25:20.440
I know it's dead wrong,

25:20.442 --> 25:22.976
but I wish I could call Stansfield.

25:22.978 --> 25:25.278
I know, there really are no good deeds.

25:25.280 --> 25:26.479
Hear, hear.

25:26.481 --> 25:27.747
The tree's got bigger balls

25:27.749 --> 25:29.148
- than you do.
- Thank you, Dad.

25:29.150 --> 25:31.885
No, serious.

25:31.887 --> 25:33.152
I don't know why I let the ghosts

25:33.154 --> 25:35.622
of Christmas past and present get to me.

25:35.624 --> 25:38.892
Well, maybe we can perform
an exorcism before midnight.

25:40.202 --> 25:41.527
OK Google,

25:41.529 --> 25:43.129
where can I find a priest?

25:43.131 --> 25:45.698
Here are the top search results...

25:45.700 --> 25:47.000
How useful.

25:47.002 --> 25:49.502
Yeah. If only it could play CDs.

25:49.504 --> 25:51.504
Getting nostalgic for
your high school mixes?

25:51.506 --> 25:52.872
No. Jeff gave it to me.

25:53.694 --> 25:55.942
Oh, that's personal, for a co-worker.

25:55.944 --> 25:57.844
I gave you mixes.
Don't be weird, Steven.

25:57.846 --> 25:59.612
I haven't had a CD player in years.

25:59.614 --> 26:01.447
Maybe you could ask Culhane.

26:03.088 --> 26:04.522
Well, you two better brighten up

26:04.557 --> 26:05.685
if you want Santa to bring you diamonds

26:05.687 --> 26:07.353
and not lumps of coal.

26:07.355 --> 26:10.056
Our family reunions are a
little more siesta than fiesta.

26:10.058 --> 26:11.491
Well,
this is the first Christmas I've had

26:11.493 --> 26:13.293
with my whole family in 12 years,

26:13.295 --> 26:15.028
so stop sucking all the fun out of it.

26:15.030 --> 26:17.363
By all means,
don't cry for me, Argentina.

26:17.365 --> 26:18.898
We're Venezuelan.

26:18.900 --> 26:20.066
Just take the win.

26:20.068 --> 26:21.567
Don't let our attitudes ruin things.

26:21.569 --> 26:24.704
Enjoy your family. Someone should.

26:26.508 --> 26:27.674
All right, everyone,

26:27.676 --> 26:29.208
gather 'round.

26:29.210 --> 26:32.045
There are a few things that I insist on

26:32.047 --> 26:33.479
during the holiday season,

26:34.423 --> 26:35.848
and this is one of them.

26:35.850 --> 26:39.118
Steven, Fallon,
if you would do me the honor...

26:42.622 --> 26:45.892
We'll start with one
of Grandpa's favorites.

26:45.894 --> 26:47.360
And get it over with.

26:50.234 --> 26:54.767
âª Good King Wenceslas looked
out on the feast of Stephen âª

26:54.769 --> 26:57.236
âª When the snow lay round about âª

26:57.238 --> 26:59.839
âª Deep and crisp and even âª

26:59.841 --> 27:02.008
âª Brightly shone the moon that night âª

27:02.010 --> 27:05.345
âª Though the frost was cruel... âª

27:34.843 --> 27:38.444
âª Deep and crisp and even âª

27:38.446 --> 27:40.213
âª Brightly shone the moon that night âª

27:40.215 --> 27:42.615
âª Though the frost was cruel âª

27:42.617 --> 27:45.485
âª When a poor man came in sight... âª

27:45.487 --> 27:48.087
They really put the white in
"White Christmas".

27:48.089 --> 27:50.490
- Sam, shh.
- Remind me to make other plans for New Year's.

27:51.793 --> 27:53.159
Wha... what?

27:53.161 --> 27:54.927
What are you doing?

27:54.929 --> 27:56.162
It's supposed to be a party.

27:56.164 --> 27:59.232
Oh, my God.

28:06.207 --> 28:08.541
Whatever racist commentary
is running through your mind,

28:08.543 --> 28:10.009
just keep it to yourself.

28:10.011 --> 28:11.611
I'm not a racist.

28:11.613 --> 28:14.747
I-I was just going to say that
homosexual really can dance.

28:18.712 --> 28:19.619
Perhaps you should remind

28:19.621 --> 28:21.954
your nephew that he should
act like a gentleman.

28:21.956 --> 28:25.058
This party is supposed to honor
the family, not embarrass them.

28:25.060 --> 28:28.327
Maybe they need to be
embarrassed more often.

28:37.405 --> 28:39.739
Well, I guess you've got
to admire their passion.

28:39.741 --> 28:41.240
You know what I admire,

28:41.242 --> 28:43.543
the fact that your little
start-up-that-could

28:43.545 --> 28:45.645
might break even first year.

28:45.647 --> 28:48.214
- That's impressive.
- Well, we'll see.

28:48.216 --> 28:50.216
Either way,
it's just the beginning for Morell Corp.

28:50.218 --> 28:51.684
I'd bet on it.

28:51.686 --> 28:54.087
You would've been a star
at Carrington Atlantic

28:54.089 --> 28:57.824
if your dad could've kept his
head out of Selena's skirt.

29:24.281 --> 29:25.299
What's the matter?

29:25.334 --> 29:26.352
You don't like the competition?

29:26.354 --> 29:28.020
I think you've already
caused enough of a scene.

29:28.022 --> 29:30.056
Me? You started it.

29:30.058 --> 29:31.424
Okay, well, now I'm ending it.

29:31.426 --> 29:34.894
You just think that you can
control everything, don't you?

29:34.929 --> 29:37.396
Especially now that you're
just part of this family

29:37.398 --> 29:39.232
and you have all this money,
you just think you can

29:39.234 --> 29:41.292
push me out and take my son.

29:41.327 --> 29:42.769
I didn't take Sam.

29:42.804 --> 29:44.403
He chose to come here.

29:44.438 --> 29:46.250
And after everything
you have done to me,

29:46.285 --> 29:49.111
I can't imagine what kind of mother
you were to him after I left.

29:49.146 --> 29:50.042
I was a good mother.

29:50.044 --> 29:52.612
Bad mothers always say that.

29:55.250 --> 29:56.211
Aah!

29:56.718 --> 29:58.151
Oh!

30:00.288 --> 30:02.522
Happy birthday, Jesus.

30:02.524 --> 30:05.224
I never did anything but try
to make your life better!

30:05.226 --> 30:07.593
Is that what you told yourself
when you abandoned us?

30:07.595 --> 30:09.695
When you got in that truck in Caracas?

30:09.697 --> 30:11.397
I had no choice. I needed a doctor.

30:11.399 --> 30:13.599
It's not my fault you never showed up.

30:13.601 --> 30:16.602
Why didn't you?

30:19.579 --> 30:21.674
Because you wanted me to leave.

30:21.676 --> 30:24.243
You blamed me for what
happened that night.

30:24.245 --> 30:26.479
That's why you think I owe you still.

30:26.481 --> 30:27.947
What are you guys talking about?

30:27.949 --> 30:29.148
Go ahead, Cristal,

30:29.150 --> 30:30.550
why don't you tell him?

30:31.195 --> 30:32.518
Why don't you tell everyone?

30:32.520 --> 30:35.087
I can't take it anymore, Iris.

30:35.905 --> 30:36.889
<i>Lo siento.</i>

30:39.422 --> 30:40.293
<i>Yo lo hice.</i>

30:42.697 --> 30:44.597
Iris, no.

30:44.699 --> 30:46.465
Iris, no.

30:59.881 --> 31:03.282
No!

31:14.277 --> 31:15.976
_

31:16.716 --> 31:17.463
Samuel...

31:18.057 --> 31:19.432
I killed your father.

31:43.871 --> 31:45.137
You're looking for my mom?

31:45.990 --> 31:48.340
Because she left
without saying good-bye.

31:48.342 --> 31:50.175
I'm looking for you, Sam.

31:50.177 --> 31:52.611
I am so sorry.

31:52.613 --> 31:54.746
About your dad, about it all.

31:54.748 --> 31:56.515
You have to know that I never wanted you

31:56.517 --> 31:57.816
to find out in this way.

31:57.818 --> 31:59.518
And how were you hoping I'd find out?

31:59.520 --> 32:01.286
There is not a day that goes by

32:01.288 --> 32:03.622
that I don't wish that I
could change what happened,

32:03.624 --> 32:07.292
or how I handled it.
But your dad was a violent man.

32:07.294 --> 32:09.266
I was protecting your mom and you.

32:09.364 --> 32:12.264
But all these years you let
me think he abandoned me.

32:12.266 --> 32:14.666
I grew up feeling completely worthless,

32:14.668 --> 32:17.769
thinking, "Why should anyone
care about me if my dad didn't".

32:17.771 --> 32:19.438
I care about you, Sam.

32:19.440 --> 32:21.340
And you're not worthless.

32:21.342 --> 32:22.808
You have to know that.

32:22.810 --> 32:25.544
Well, I-I'm glad
you saved my mom that night.

32:25.546 --> 32:27.446
But you robbed me

32:27.448 --> 32:31.083
of the truth about my life
every single day after that.

32:37.385 --> 32:39.125
I know that saying sorry
won't make up for tonight...

32:39.127 --> 32:41.694
Tonight?
What about the last five months?

32:41.696 --> 32:44.897
I know you don't trust me right now,
but please let me explain.

32:44.899 --> 32:47.099
What, just like you did about
your relationship with Matthew?

32:47.101 --> 32:48.976
Or that your real name is Celia?

32:49.011 --> 32:51.656
Or that you stole hundreds
of thousands of dollars?

32:52.435 --> 32:55.772
I know that I have said this before,
but this is it.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.543
This is everything, I promise.

32:57.905 --> 33:00.773
And I'm willing to do
whatever it takes to show you

33:00.775 --> 33:02.775
that this is the whole me,

33:02.777 --> 33:06.011
that I love you with my whole heart.

33:06.013 --> 33:08.047
And that is the whole truth.

33:09.317 --> 33:11.350
Can you believe me?

33:11.352 --> 33:12.985
Yes, I believe you.

33:13.783 --> 33:14.820
I believe that you are willing

33:14.822 --> 33:19.792
to do whatever it takes to
put your past behind you.

33:19.794 --> 33:21.794
I just don't know that I am.

33:21.796 --> 33:23.495
What does that mean?

33:35.176 --> 33:36.408
You're up early.

33:37.611 --> 33:39.511
Well, it's hard to rest for Santa

33:39.513 --> 33:42.247
when you have a murderous
stepmom sleeping down the hall.

33:42.249 --> 33:43.882
What's your excuse?

33:43.884 --> 33:46.151
I got you something.

33:47.321 --> 33:49.688
Enjoy memory lane.

33:49.690 --> 33:51.824
What are you two reminiscing about?

33:51.826 --> 33:54.460
You know, back in the old days,
we used to hire the help

33:54.462 --> 33:56.662
to make the beds, not sleep in them.

33:56.664 --> 33:58.197
- That's enough.
- I know you think

33:58.199 --> 34:00.866
I'm just an old, white,
closed-minded tight-ass.

34:00.868 --> 34:03.168
- Go on.
- But I was young once.

34:03.170 --> 34:05.938
And a lot like you in some ways.

34:05.940 --> 34:08.574
I had my own lost weekend.

34:08.576 --> 34:11.409
Quite a few of them if I'm being honest.

34:11.411 --> 34:15.114
And your great-grandfather
snapped me out of it,

34:15.116 --> 34:16.715
just like I did to you.

34:16.717 --> 34:19.418
- What?
- But that's what this family is, right?

34:19.420 --> 34:24.056
We love life, we get drunk,
and we do cocaine with Stevie Nicks.

34:24.058 --> 34:26.518
But we're not kids anymore, Steven.

34:26.594 --> 34:28.860
And your father didn't
get rid of your friend

34:28.862 --> 34:32.063
just so you could go down
that destructive path again.

34:36.704 --> 34:39.438
You couldn't have kept that to yourself?

34:39.440 --> 34:41.607
That was a rotten thing to say.

34:41.609 --> 34:44.243
Sometimes rotten things have to be said.

34:44.245 --> 34:47.079
And done, Carrington style.

34:48.081 --> 34:50.449
Now, I let your father keep his job.

34:50.451 --> 34:52.583
But if you think I'm
gonna let him disobey me

34:52.585 --> 34:55.320
without any consequences,

34:55.322 --> 34:58.424
you're not the smart businesswoman
I always thought you were.

34:58.426 --> 35:00.292
It's called evolving, Grandpa.

35:00.294 --> 35:02.027
You should try it.

35:02.029 --> 35:03.829
Sooner the better.

35:12.406 --> 35:16.275
Well, there's another
Christmas without a good-bye.

35:16.277 --> 35:19.578
Everyone deals with their
families in their own way.

35:19.580 --> 35:22.080
Some choose to leave
them during the holidays,

35:22.082 --> 35:24.249
others after a murder.

35:25.321 --> 35:26.919
You chose to bring Iris here

35:26.921 --> 35:29.488
so you'd find out more about Cristal.

35:29.490 --> 35:31.824
I hate to say you got what
you wished for, but...

35:31.826 --> 35:33.425
At least I get my chess partner back.

35:33.427 --> 35:34.793
Hmm.

35:34.795 --> 35:36.428
I bet you miss winning.

35:36.430 --> 35:39.231
I only let your father win so
he feels good about himself.

35:39.233 --> 35:42.100
You, on the other hand,
like the challenge.

35:43.637 --> 35:45.904
You did have Ted arrested.

35:45.906 --> 35:47.372
Grandpa just told me.

35:47.374 --> 35:50.175
Good luck with that.

35:50.177 --> 35:51.577
Fool me once, right?

35:51.579 --> 35:53.612
No, I fooled your grandfather.

35:53.614 --> 35:55.747
Steven,
I had nothing to do with Ted's arrest.

35:55.749 --> 35:58.152
Uh, not to say that I minded it.

35:58.252 --> 35:59.785
Why do you keep
defending the guy anyway?

35:59.787 --> 36:01.186
He's nothing but quicksand.

36:01.188 --> 36:02.688
All he's ever done is drag you down.

36:02.690 --> 36:05.090
Ted didn't drag me down.

36:05.092 --> 36:06.859
I dragged him.

36:06.861 --> 36:09.361
You know, you need to stop
blaming other people

36:09.363 --> 36:10.796
for what I do.

36:10.798 --> 36:11.763
I'm trying to protect you.

36:11.765 --> 36:12.898
Been trying my whole life.

36:12.900 --> 36:14.566
You really think that helps me?

36:14.568 --> 36:17.870
Blaming other people for my mistakes?

36:17.872 --> 36:19.171
Ted's in jail.

36:19.173 --> 36:20.472
That's where I should be.

36:20.474 --> 36:21.707
You didn't have drugs in your car.

36:21.709 --> 36:24.676
- Stop being a martyr.
- I'm talking about Dominic Ortega.

36:25.789 --> 36:28.031
Stansfield told me before he left town.

36:28.066 --> 36:29.648
I messed up on that rig.

36:29.650 --> 36:32.384
Ortega died,
and you made Matthew cover it up.

36:33.103 --> 36:34.820
It would have ruined you, son.

36:34.822 --> 36:36.788
Well...

36:36.790 --> 36:38.991
now it's ruined us.

36:43.197 --> 36:45.831
Hey.

36:47.134 --> 36:48.467
Thank you for coming.

36:48.469 --> 36:49.835
If you just wanted to apologize again,

36:49.837 --> 36:51.403
you could've done that on the phone.

36:51.405 --> 36:52.905
Well, then I couldn't
have given you this.

36:54.408 --> 36:56.675
The Colby Kids Fund?

36:56.677 --> 36:58.810
It's a nonprofit endowment that
provides transportation vouchers

36:58.812 --> 37:01.346
for children to visit
their incarcerated parents.

37:01.348 --> 37:03.649
So this is just another tax
break to get your books right.

37:03.651 --> 37:07.853
No. I decided that Morell Corp.
will end its year in the red.

37:07.855 --> 37:10.355
Some things are more
important than finances.

37:11.258 --> 37:12.491
Few things.

37:12.493 --> 37:15.093
But you were always there for me.

37:15.095 --> 37:16.795
Especially when my mom left.

37:16.797 --> 37:19.364
I just, I wish you could've
let me be there for you.

37:19.366 --> 37:21.366
Your mom traipsing off to
England is not the same thing

37:21.368 --> 37:23.569
as my dad getting arrested for drugs.

37:23.571 --> 37:27.542
I was so embarrassed by the
clichÃ© he turned me into.

37:27.577 --> 37:30.509
A scholarship kid with a dad in prison.

37:30.511 --> 37:32.611
I never even went to go visit him.

37:32.613 --> 37:35.213
And he was so hurt by it
that he never forgave me.

37:35.215 --> 37:37.916
I mean, I was just a kid.

37:37.918 --> 37:41.153
But he said, "We all reap what we sow."

37:41.474 --> 37:42.788
But I mean, hey,

37:42.790 --> 37:46.224
at least my friends didn't
see me as less than.

37:46.226 --> 37:48.527
Or as their own personal charity case.

37:48.529 --> 37:50.495
But, Monica,
I've never seen you that way.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.066
Fallon, I'm not just here

37:54.068 --> 37:55.801
to make you feel good about yourself.

37:55.803 --> 37:57.369
Jeff can do that.

37:57.371 --> 38:00.005
And if you really cared
about our friendship,

38:00.007 --> 38:02.329
you'd stop using him to replace Culhane.

38:02.376 --> 38:04.476
But I'm not.

38:04.478 --> 38:07.346
I mean, Jeff did literally
tell me I could use him...

38:07.348 --> 38:09.147
Well, then, that's on you, Fallon.

38:09.149 --> 38:11.183
But we all reap what we sow.

38:14.930 --> 38:16.088
Hey, Bobbi?

38:16.090 --> 38:18.132
Oh, sorry, Chief of Police.

38:18.659 --> 38:20.692
I'll never get used to calling you that.

38:20.694 --> 38:23.929
Can't believe how far
my cousin's come up.

38:23.931 --> 38:25.564
Yeah, I just wanted to thank you

38:25.566 --> 38:27.733
for helping me with
that Ted Dinard thing.

38:27.735 --> 38:29.401
I owe you.

38:31.672 --> 38:32.971
He's ready for you.

38:34.579 --> 38:36.942
What the hell was that all about?

38:36.944 --> 38:39.011
- I didn't know she would...
- _

38:39.013 --> 38:40.445
Fallon Carrington?

38:40.447 --> 38:42.080
I shouldn't have told her, all right?

38:42.082 --> 38:44.028
I had no idea she would come and visit.

38:44.085 --> 38:46.952
And here I was thinking you were
the smart one in the family.

38:46.953 --> 38:48.153
_

38:48.188 --> 38:51.923
- It's not what it looks like, Dad.
- No, it's not.

38:51.925 --> 38:53.959
You're in one hell of a mess.

38:54.634 --> 38:56.128
And it's my fault.

38:58.399 --> 39:00.632
What, you...
think I'm here on drug charges?

39:00.634 --> 39:03.468
You think I'm that much of a stereotype?

39:03.470 --> 39:05.904
Mm-hmm, yeah, sure looks like one.

39:05.906 --> 39:07.272
But try being a black man in Georgia

39:07.274 --> 39:08.774
with no legal representation,

39:08.776 --> 39:10.509
forced to appear in front of a judge

39:10.511 --> 39:13.145
and explain how a brick of blow
got into the trunk of my car.

39:13.147 --> 39:15.080
A judge whose country club membership

39:15.082 --> 39:17.115
is paid for by the Carringtons.

39:17.117 --> 39:18.817
Mm.

39:18.819 --> 39:20.752
Yeah, they wanted me gone.

39:20.754 --> 39:22.554
Quietly.

39:22.556 --> 39:24.790
So it wouldn't come out that
I was trying to kill the man

39:24.792 --> 39:27.192
that was screwing your mother.

39:28.495 --> 39:30.495
Blake Carrington.

39:32.099 --> 39:34.332
Think I don't know that?

39:34.334 --> 39:36.101
Wish it hadn't taken so long

39:36.103 --> 39:40.272
for you to tell me yourself,
but I figured it out.

39:41.483 --> 39:45.343
Why do you think I'm getting
so close to his family?

39:45.345 --> 39:47.546
Hmm?

39:47.547 --> 39:52.421
_

40:04.031 --> 40:05.497
Monica?

40:05.499 --> 40:06.898
Can I come in?

40:14.007 --> 40:15.707
You think you know a person.

40:15.709 --> 40:16.908
And then...

40:17.276 --> 40:19.231
This is the crappiest mix

40:19.266 --> 40:20.886
anyone has ever made me.

40:21.296 --> 40:23.048
I didn't choose the songs.

40:23.050 --> 40:26.852
Some teacher/DJ did at
the Penley winter dance.

40:26.854 --> 40:28.286
Oh, my God.

40:28.288 --> 40:30.722
2007. The night you stood me up.

40:30.724 --> 40:33.024
We all make mistakes.

40:33.026 --> 40:36.795
Well, at least this is one we can fix.

40:36.797 --> 40:38.597
But I can't do this anymore.

40:38.599 --> 40:41.633
I don't want to use you anymore.

40:43.070 --> 40:45.904
I want this to be real.

41:04.158 --> 41:05.891
What are you doing?

41:05.893 --> 41:07.959
Making my own choices.

41:07.961 --> 41:09.795
How about you?

41:24.511 --> 41:25.911
Diego Calastana.

41:25.913 --> 41:28.079
I am sorry to keep you waiting.

41:28.081 --> 41:29.848
Blake Carrington.

41:29.850 --> 41:32.150
What a pleasure it is to meet you.

41:34.625 --> 41:36.521
Been looking forward to
this for quite some time.
