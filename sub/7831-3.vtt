that Bart must learn to

an unseasonable heat wave.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.746
[Kent Brockman On TV]
And so Springfield's heat wave continues...

13:38.851 --> 13:41.342
with today's temperature exceeding
the record for this date...

13:41.453 --> 13:43.444
set way back four billion
years ago...

13:43.556 --> 13:45.922

a ball of molten lava.

13:46.025 --> 13:50.519
Oh, so hot.

13:50.629 --> 13:53.063
Homer, have you seen
the frozen peas?

13:53.165 --> 13:55.929
- [Grunts]
- Um, you keep 'em.

13:56.035 --> 13:58.902
Now listen, if we can't
afford private school...

13:59.004 --> 14:01.632
maybe there's some
other way to encourage Lisa.

14:01.740 --> 14:04.208
Um, an art class,
ballet lessons.

14:04.310 --> 14:07.541
They have some fun things you can do
at the museum on Saturday.

14:07.646 --> 14:11.548
Uh-uh. Forget it, Marge. There is no way
I'm spending my Saturdays at a museum.

have foosball, do they?

- Unless-
- Unless what?

14:34.506 --> 14:38.567
Well, there's that $200 we've been
saving for the new air conditioner.

14:38.677 --> 14:42.841
Oh, Marge, but we've needed
a new air conditioner for years.

14:42.948 --> 14:45.246
And our stop-gap solution
is getting cranky.

14:45.351 --> 14:47.319

14:47.419 --> 14:50.911
I cannot believe this. I'm trying to give
our daughter a head start in life...

14:51.023 --> 14:52.923
and you aren't
helping a bit.

14:53.025 --> 14:56.426
Marge, name one successful person
who ever lived without air conditioning.

14:56.528 --> 15:00.328
- Balzac.
- No need for potty mouth just
because you can't think of one.

15:00.432 --> 15:03.765
- But Balzac is the name.
- [Babbling]

15:03.869 --> 15:06.463

and nuts-

15:06.572 --> 15:08.506
- Uh, how does the rest of that go?
- Please...

15:08.607 --> 15:12.441
just promise you won't buy an air conditioner
till we've figured out a way to help Lisa.

15:12.544 --> 15:14.637
All right, all right.
I promise.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.772
Must be another way to get
an air conditioner.

15:16.882 --> 15:19.510

- What, Flanders?

15:31.697 --> 15:34.530
Well, sir, I hate to be a suspicious
Aloysius on you...

15:34.633 --> 15:36.533
but did you steal
my air conditioner?

15:42.675 --> 15:46.042
Well, I admit it looks bad, Flanders,
but haven't you heard of...

15:46.145 --> 15:50.172

cast the first stone"? [Groans]

15:50.282 --> 15:52.978

looked their worst-

15:56.422 --> 16:00.984
I realized I could make money selling
my medication to deadheads.

16:01.093 --> 16:03.391

talking about?

16:03.495 --> 16:05.395
Oh, nothing.

be worse for Lisa or Bart.

to realize it had grown into a beautiful swan."
