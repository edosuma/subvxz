Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop Hollywood"...

00:05.505 --> 00:07.974
{\an7}This is where we are.
It's like we're already married.

00:08.041 --> 00:10.110
{\an8}Things are getting
pretty serious.

00:10.176 --> 00:13.012
{\an7}I would like you to be
the feature girl in my video.

00:13.079 --> 00:14.147
{\an9}What?!

00:14.214 --> 00:16.049
{\an7}So what's going on
with you and Princess.

00:16.116 --> 00:18.418
{\an7}We love each other to death,
and that's what I'm scared of.

00:18.485 --> 00:19.853
{\an8}I just need another chance.

00:19.919 --> 00:22.989
{\an8}The only person that means
something to me is you.

00:23.056 --> 00:25.125
{\an8}The only thing I could do
was go tell my family

00:25.191 --> 00:26.426
{\an8}before she told my family.

00:26.493 --> 00:29.629
{\an8}Like, how did it end?

00:26.493 --> 00:29.629
{\an8}They wanna meet you.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.198
{\an7}I'm doing my music, but,
like, in the beginning stages.

00:32.265 --> 00:33.400
{\an8}You know what I'm saying?

00:32.265 --> 00:33.400
{\an9}Right.

00:33.466 --> 00:35.769
{\an7}And it's like I'm relying
on the simple fact

00:35.835 --> 00:36.970
{\an8}that you're gonna help me.

00:37.036 --> 00:38.505
{\an8}Sharpen up and wait
for your moment.

00:38.571 --> 00:41.141
{\an8}What if my moment is now
and it's passing us by?!

00:41.207 --> 00:45.378
{\an8}I can't help but to think what
life would be like as a family.

00:45.445 --> 00:49.015
{\an8}Do those thoughts ever,
like, cross your mind?

00:49.082 --> 00:50.950
{\an8}I don't know if
I really see us,

00:51.017 --> 00:53.887
{\an8}like, in that
space again.

00:53.953 --> 00:55.355
{\an8}I saw Moniece out there.

00:55.422 --> 00:58.291
{\an7}I just gotta tell you something
crazy she just told me.

00:58.358 --> 01:00.326
{\an9}What?

00:58.358 --> 01:00.326
{\an8}She confessed her love for me.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.430
{\an8}Don't start, Princess.

01:00.393 --> 01:03.430
{\an8}(Bleep), I'll find
the Dumpster you live in.

01:03.496 --> 01:05.498
{\an8}Do not start.

01:03.496 --> 01:05.498
{\an8}And I will beat your ass, bitch.

01:45.138 --> 01:47.507
{\an8}I'll admit, after confessing
my feelings to Dreux,

01:47.574 --> 01:49.209
{\an8}I really don't even know
what I was thinking.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.344
There's a reason we didn't work
out in the first place.

01:51.411 --> 01:52.879
I realized
that I'm with Rich

01:52.946 --> 01:54.914
and I really need to focus on
what's in front of me.

01:54.981 --> 01:57.750
{\an1}Oh, wait, here, let me
get that for you, King Richie.

01:57.817 --> 01:59.586
Oh, here you go,
muffin.

01:59.652 --> 02:01.020
{\an4}Thank you.

01:59.652 --> 02:01.020
Oh, you're so welcome.

02:01.087 --> 02:02.989
{\an5}(Moniece)
Rich has done everything
that I've asked,

02:03.056 --> 02:04.724
including sit down
with my baby daddy,

02:04.791 --> 02:06.392
which I know he really
didn't wanna do.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.026
So I need to stop
being hung up on the past

02:08.094 --> 02:09.662
with a man that
I was in love with

02:09.729 --> 02:12.866
and focus on the future with
the man that I am in love with.

02:12.932 --> 02:16.002
{\an5}I heard that you met
with my baby daddy.

02:12.932 --> 02:16.002
{\an1}I did.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.438
{\an5}How did it go?

02:16.069 --> 02:18.438
{\an1}It was a man-to-man
conversation,

02:18.505 --> 02:19.639
it was a good conversation.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.574
{\an1}I like Dreux,
and I like how he came at me.

02:21.641 --> 02:23.576
A lot different than what
I thought it was gonna be.

02:23.643 --> 02:24.844
So I'm-- I'm comfortable.

02:24.911 --> 02:26.980
{\an5}I'm glad that it was positive.

02:24.911 --> 02:26.980
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

02:27.046 --> 02:30.850
{\an1}And I just wanna say thank you
for doing that for me.

02:30.917 --> 02:32.519
This is the summer of Mo-Mo.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.754
{\an5}We should just be able
to check all your stuff
off your bucket list.

02:34.821 --> 02:38.224
{\an6}Well...

02:34.821 --> 02:38.224
{\an1}Meet with mom.
Me with baby daddy.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.626
Blasé, blasé.

02:39.692 --> 02:43.463
Well, the blasé, blasé
is ring shopping, sizing.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.131
{\an1}Okay.

02:45.198 --> 02:47.233
{\an5}(Rich)
So is Moniece really asking me
for a wedding ring?

02:47.300 --> 02:49.769
{\an8}I mean, I know Mo-Mo's a little
wedding crazy and everything.

02:49.836 --> 02:51.404
{\an8}I even like
to joke around with it.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.406
But truth be told...

02:53.473 --> 02:55.475
your man Dollaz is ready
to settle down.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.544
{\an5}Let's go shopping.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.544
{\an3}Okay.

02:57.610 --> 03:00.780
I want a man ring that's
as big as your girl ring.

03:00.847 --> 03:03.383
{\an1}I wanted to get you a titanium
band with black diamonds.

03:03.449 --> 03:05.251
{\an4}Do it.

03:03.449 --> 03:05.251
We have to get sized.

03:05.318 --> 03:06.753
{\an1}Do it.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.555
{\an5}Take charge.

03:06.819 --> 03:08.555
{\an3}You do it.

03:08.621 --> 03:10.256
{\an5}I don't have to take charge.

03:08.621 --> 03:10.256
Take charge.

03:10.323 --> 03:11.658
You're the man.

03:11.724 --> 03:14.127
You are proposing to me.

03:14.193 --> 03:16.362
{\an4}Mmm...

03:14.193 --> 03:16.362
So you-- yeah.

03:16.429 --> 03:19.832
{\an5}I mean, I love Mo,
and I actually want to take
things to the next level.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.601
But all these
demands and stuff?

03:21.668 --> 03:24.404
I can already see what kind of
bridezilla she gon' be.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.039
{\an5}You're stuck with me forever.

03:24.470 --> 03:26.039
{\an1}Whatever.

03:26.105 --> 03:29.576
You not going nowhere.

I'm lucky enough to have
some true friends

{\an8}who've had my back
no matter what.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.754
{\an8}I mean, I've known

03:41.821 --> 03:43.723
{\an8}We grew up together,
we went to school together,

03:43.790 --> 03:46.225

{\an8}Nothin', man.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.799
{\an7}That's the question
we wanna ask you, brother,
what's really popping?

03:52.865 --> 03:56.302
{\an5}(Miles) My sexual identity
is not something that I usually
talk about with my boys.

03:56.369 --> 03:59.205
And even though I never brought
it up, the streets is talking

03:59.272 --> 04:00.673
and I know
they heard something.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.108
So now that it's out there,

04:02.175 --> 04:04.444
I want them to hear it
from me, they boy.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.713
{\an1}Seriously, though,
what's really going on, bro?

04:06.779 --> 04:08.982
{\an1}Man, I just been going through
some (bleep), bro.

04:09.048 --> 04:11.284
Like for real, like...

04:11.351 --> 04:13.920
{\an1}I don't want you (bleep)
find out like that, but, uh...

04:13.987 --> 04:17.624
{\an7}We your bros, man, you could've
called us, come and told us.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.726
{\an4}We shoulda been the first people
you came and talked to.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.726
(Bleep), I'ma talk to y'all.

04:20.793 --> 04:23.162
{\an1}I had to talk to Amber,
I had to talk to my family.

04:23.229 --> 04:24.664
How the (bleep) I'ma talk
to y'all first?

04:24.731 --> 04:26.399
How long you been knowing?

04:26.466 --> 04:28.101
{\an5}About two years.

04:26.466 --> 04:28.101
That's crazy.

04:28.167 --> 04:30.637
I mean, I've always thought
you was a little metro,

04:30.703 --> 04:33.439
{\an5}you know what I'm saying?

04:30.703 --> 04:33.439
Y'all know me, I haven't
changed at all, right?

04:33.506 --> 04:34.874
I still stand in front
of you the same man...

04:34.941 --> 04:36.242
A little bit,
a little bit.

04:36.309 --> 04:38.444
A little bit, I changed
a little bit on y'all?

04:38.511 --> 04:40.513
{\an8}What y'all gonna do
about the rapping?

04:40.580 --> 04:43.516
{\an7}I'm just keeping it 100,
so if y'all can respect me
and still love me for that...

04:43.583 --> 04:45.351
I respect it, bro,
I respect it.

04:45.418 --> 04:48.087
{\an5}I respect it,
I just ain't going on

It'll be a work-in-progress
with my boys,

04:51.424 --> 04:53.192
but mostly,
I feel relieved.

04:53.259 --> 04:54.994
These aren't just my friends.

04:55.061 --> 04:56.796
They're rappers,
producers,

and the kind of people
that I'm scared to come out to.

04:59.232 --> 05:02.235
I don't know what to think,
but so far, it feels good.

05:02.301 --> 05:05.238
{\an5}It is what it is.
Once you get over the shock,
it's like... a'ight.

05:05.304 --> 05:07.140
{\an5}Some real stuff, bro,
at the end of the day,
I am proud of you.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.978
to get Princess back.

06:19.045 --> 06:23.049
{\an1}Listen, only if you
say yes, though,

06:23.116 --> 06:24.784

Ray is a lot of things,

{\an8}but predictable
is not one of them.

06:31.991 --> 06:35.962
{\an8}I know he wants me back, and
this is a crazy, big gesture,

06:36.028 --> 06:38.698
but after all of
the fighting

06:38.765 --> 06:41.534
and me going to jail
and his A-P-T party,

06:41.601 --> 06:43.302
there's just a lot of
things that he's done

06:43.369 --> 06:45.938

ever really gonna change.

06:46.005 --> 06:47.607
Last time
I talked to you,

06:47.673 --> 06:51.110
{\an1}we talked about taking it slow,
starting off as friends.

{\an1}Yeah, I wanna take it slow,
I wanna start off as friends.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.414
{\an5}But we already three years in.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.414
You bought a house?

06:55.481 --> 06:57.617
{\an1}I wanted to take it
to the next level

look, I'm not playing around.

07:00.586 --> 07:02.789

though.

07:07.293 --> 07:08.761
if I say yes to this,

07:08.828 --> 07:11.430
this means no more games,

07:11.497 --> 07:13.499
no more partying,
no more strippers,

07:13.566 --> 07:15.001
like, none at all.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.736
{\an4}No, done.

07:15.067 --> 07:16.736
No mistakes, no nothing.

07:16.803 --> 07:18.471
I did a lot of things,

07:18.538 --> 07:21.174
{\an1}but I'm done with that crazy
(bleep) I do, you know?

07:21.240 --> 07:23.843
{\an1}I just wanna come home
and be with you.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.378
(Princess)
I love Ray.

07:25.444 --> 07:28.281
And I'm willing to give him
one more chance.

07:28.347 --> 07:30.550
But I don't wanna keep making
the same mistakes.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.385
If we're gonna
really do this,

07:32.451 --> 07:35.421
I need to know
he's a 110% committed.

07:35.488 --> 07:38.424
You know a big part
of the issue

07:38.491 --> 07:41.594
we had at the other place
was I didn't feel secure.

07:41.661 --> 07:45.231
I had to leave,
you know what I mean?

07:45.298 --> 07:48.534
I need you to do one thing
for me to make me feel

07:48.601 --> 07:52.371
{\an5}just 100% comfortable.

07:48.601 --> 07:52.371
Whatever you wanna do.

07:52.438 --> 07:54.273
I need this house
to be in my name.

07:54.340 --> 07:57.210
{\an5}(Ray J)
Listen, I bought
this house for Princess.

07:57.276 --> 07:59.745
But will I sign over
all of the documents to her

07:59.812 --> 08:03.482
and expect for her to be
as loyal as I am right now?

08:03.549 --> 08:06.652
{\an5}You know, Princess
has proven to me that
as long as I do right by her,

08:06.719 --> 08:10.156
she's gonna always have my back
and love me and only me.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.258
So it's time for me
to bet on myself

08:12.325 --> 08:16.162
and be that man I know I'm
supposed to be for her forever.

08:16.229 --> 08:18.664
Done, I'm already
working on that.

08:18.731 --> 08:20.066
You know what I mean?

08:20.132 --> 08:21.934
But I didn't wanna wait till
then, I wanted to do it now.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.537
{\an1}I felt like if I didn't
step up to the plate,

08:24.604 --> 08:26.105
then I was gonna lose you.

08:26.172 --> 08:28.307
{\an1}And there would've been
no turning back.

08:28.374 --> 08:29.809
{\an1}I would have
regretted that.

08:29.876 --> 08:32.378
{\an1}Only if you want to,
though.

08:32.445 --> 08:33.746
Of course I want to.

08:33.813 --> 08:35.047
What do you mean?

08:35.114 --> 08:37.817
{\an4}Yeah?

08:35.114 --> 08:37.817
Yeah.

{\an8}and admitted to me that she
was still in love with me."

08:52.932 --> 08:54.634
{\an7}It wasn't about
moving forward with me.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.736

My boy Hassan is throwing
a party for Fashion Week.

I'm still looking for
the face of my 79 Gold.

09:24.363 --> 09:26.832
This is a great opportunity
for me to get some work done

09:26.899 --> 09:28.567

{\an5}(Nikki)
You know your girl
loves Fashion Week.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.245
{\an8}But seeing Rich Dollaz here
had me a little bit distracted.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.881
{\an5}Ever since Fizz told me
that Moniece still had
feelings for him,

09:41.948 --> 09:43.549
it made me feel
some type of way,

09:43.616 --> 09:46.118
especially because I've been
dating Fizz for a minute now.

09:46.185 --> 09:48.821
I mean, it's straight-up shady
telling one man you love him

09:48.888 --> 09:50.523
while you're in love
with another man.

09:50.589 --> 09:52.425
And I think that Rich
needs to know.

09:52.491 --> 09:54.894
{\an5}Hey, Rich.

09:52.491 --> 09:54.894
What up, baby?

09:54.961 --> 09:56.162
{\an5}How are you, honey?

09:54.961 --> 09:56.162
Good, how are you?

09:56.228 --> 09:58.464
{\an5}I'm good, thank you.
Nice to see you.

09:56.228 --> 09:58.464
{\an1}Always.

09:58.531 --> 09:59.899
How did you enjoy
the fashion show?

09:59.966 --> 10:01.634
It was cool,
it was cool.

10:01.701 --> 10:04.003
Can I have, um, a glass
of champagne, please?

10:04.070 --> 10:06.472
So what's good?
What's going on?

10:06.539 --> 10:08.674
{\an1}Ain't (bleep), slow motion,
enjoying L.A. life.

10:08.741 --> 10:11.744
{\an7}I'm out here partying and
kicking it and working with 79,

10:11.811 --> 10:14.380
{\an7}but, obviously,
I'm out here with Mo-Mo, so...

10:14.447 --> 10:17.483
Oh... so, okay, well,
let me tell you...

10:17.550 --> 10:18.918
Yo, I feel like there's
something funny going on

10:18.985 --> 10:21.153
{\an4}right now because
you were like, "Oh."

10:18.985 --> 10:21.153
{\an3}No.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.222
{\an5}Well, look, so you know
I've been dating Fizz
for a little while.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.625
{\an5}He had asked me to do
his video shoot.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.625
{\an1}Right.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.728
{\an1}So I kind of was like, you know,
I don't really wanna do this

10:28.794 --> 10:30.296
{\an1}just 'cause I have my hands
in so much other stuff.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.031
So it was like the day
of his video shoot,

10:32.098 --> 10:35.201
I came to support him
and I ran into Moniece.

10:35.267 --> 10:38.704
{\an5}She was in the video?

10:35.267 --> 10:38.704
She was the face of the video.

10:38.771 --> 10:40.439
{\an4}Really?

10:38.771 --> 10:40.439
{\an3}Yeah.

10:40.506 --> 10:42.274
{\an5}(Rich)
Moniece is in Fizz's video?
What the (bleep) is that?

10:42.341 --> 10:44.310
I'm glad that Mo-Mo getting
along with her baby daddy,

10:44.377 --> 10:47.646
but being in this video is just,
mmm, a little bit weird for me.

10:47.713 --> 10:49.582
{\an4}I wasn't mad a lot about it
at all because I was like,
you know,

10:49.648 --> 10:52.385
{\an4}it's great to see you guys
co-parenting and getting along.

10:49.648 --> 10:52.385
{\an1}Right.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.553
{\an1}So I stepped inside,
I saw Fizz and he was like,

10:54.620 --> 10:57.089
you know, "Nikki, um, there's
something I wanna tell you."

10:57.156 --> 10:58.758
And I was like,
"Okay, what?"

10:58.824 --> 11:01.560
{\an1}He's like, you know, "Moniece is
being really emotional today

11:01.627 --> 11:03.929
and admitted that she was
still in love with me."

11:03.996 --> 11:06.265
So I was like... "Oh."

11:06.332 --> 11:09.535
You know, I didn't
really know-- What?

11:09.602 --> 11:11.670
You want me to repeat it
to you one more time?

11:11.737 --> 11:13.239
Your girl is in love
with her baby daddy.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.608
{\an5}(Rich)
First Moniece asked me
to move to L.A.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.343
Then it was gettin'
the right apartment.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.911
Then it was meeting
Mom Dukes.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.413
Then it was baby daddy.

11:20.479 --> 11:21.814
Now we ring shopping.

11:21.881 --> 11:23.949
And after all that,
she's going back behind my back

11:24.016 --> 11:25.818
and telling her baby daddy
she still love him?

11:25.885 --> 11:27.219
I can take a lot of B.S.,

11:27.286 --> 11:29.388
but that right there
is taking me over the level.

11:29.455 --> 11:31.891
{\an5}Yo, my thing is like,
yo, just keep it 100.

11:29.455 --> 11:31.891
{\an3}Right.

11:31.957 --> 11:34.326
{\an1}If you have feelings,
then just move like that.

11:34.393 --> 11:36.362
{\an1}Yo, this girl got me
looking for rings.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.330
{\an5}So are you in love?

11:36.429 --> 11:38.330
Absolutely.

11:38.397 --> 11:41.200
{\an5}So you feel played.

11:38.397 --> 11:41.200
Abso-(bleep)-lutely.

11:41.267 --> 11:43.636
I'm out here and then...

11:43.702 --> 11:45.104
{\an1}you're telling your baby daddy
that you love him.

11:45.171 --> 11:47.773
And that y'all wanna
try to figure it out.

11:47.840 --> 11:49.375
You can't come back from this.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.776
{\an4}You can't come back
from telling me this.

11:49.442 --> 11:50.776
No, I understand.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.578
{\an5}I understand,
it is hurtful, for sure.

11:50.843 --> 11:52.578
You know what?

11:52.645 --> 11:55.014

figure it out.

11:55.081 --> 11:56.315
Nice to see you.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.616

15:12.511 --> 15:14.713
You <i> are</i> the king
of my castle.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.583
{\an5}You'll always be.

15:14.780 --> 15:17.583
Always will be.

15:17.650 --> 15:21.186
They'll come around, we gonna--
everybody is gonna come around.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.222
(whispering)
I'll get something to eat.

15:23.289 --> 15:25.024
Everybody's gonna
come around.

15:25.090 --> 15:26.692
You're my baby.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.560
Always gonna be my baby.

15:28.627 --> 15:30.262
I love you no matter what.

15:30.329 --> 15:34.300
{\an5}You can put on a duck suit
and walk around quacking
if you want to.

15:34.366 --> 15:36.435
{\an4}(laughing)
Stop it, please.

15:34.366 --> 15:36.435
Okay?

15:36.502 --> 15:40.406
Quack, quack, quack.
I would not care, okay?

15:40.472 --> 15:43.208
{\an5}(Miles)
I'm at a place with my family
that I thought I'd never be.

15:43.275 --> 15:46.712
{\an5}And honestly,
I owe a lot of the motivation
to get there to Milan.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.581
My family just doesn't welcome
new people with open arms.

15:49.648 --> 15:52.818
{\an5}I'm just hoping and praying
that they extend the same
respect for Milan

15:52.885 --> 15:54.653
that they say that
they got for me.

15:54.720 --> 15:55.854
I love you to death.

15:55.921 --> 15:58.390
And are-- have you,
do you--

15:58.457 --> 16:01.026
What do you really know
about this Milan, Miles?

16:01.093 --> 16:03.028
(doorbell ringing)

16:05.898 --> 16:09.134
{\an5}(Miles sighing)

16:05.898 --> 16:09.134
Bring him on.

16:15.341 --> 16:18.744
{\an6}What's up?

16:15.341 --> 16:18.744
What's going on?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.179
{\an8}You need to understand that.

16:20.245 --> 16:22.481
{\an7}If you gonna be in this family
then you need to understand

16:22.548 --> 16:23.849
{\an7}where the (bleep)
we come from.

16:23.916 --> 16:26.885
{\an7}'Cause that's how we roll,
we roll with each other.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.954
{\an7}You stuck your nose
in my business.

16:29.021 --> 16:30.789
{\an7}I'll don't give (bleep) about
your (bleep) boyfriend.

16:30.856 --> 16:32.491
{\an8}Yeah, do it.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.633
{\an8}♪♪

16:43.502 --> 16:45.471
{\an6}What's up?

16:43.502 --> 16:45.471
What's going on?

16:45.537 --> 16:48.040
{\an5}(Milan)
When Miles told me that
his family wanted to meet me,

16:48.107 --> 16:50.242
{\an8}at first I was extremely happy
that he was ready

16:50.309 --> 16:51.877
{\an8}to take the next step
in our relationship,

16:51.944 --> 16:53.679
but now,
I'm nervous as hell.

16:53.746 --> 16:54.947
I don't know what
they're gonna think

16:55.013 --> 16:56.248
or what they're gonna
say to me.

16:56.315 --> 16:58.784
Mom, Charmagne,
this is Milan.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.219
{\an5}How you doing?

16:58.851 --> 17:00.219
Hey, how you doing?

17:00.285 --> 17:01.487
{\an5}This is my sister, Charmagne.

17:00.285 --> 17:01.487
Milan, nice to meet you.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.088
{\an5}This is my mom, Charlene.

17:01.553 --> 17:03.088
How you doing?

17:03.155 --> 17:07.226
{\an5}(Charlene)
Hi, Milan, nice to meet you.

17:03.155 --> 17:07.226
(Miles sighing)

17:07.291 --> 17:11.597
{\an8}So, uh... they wanted to meet
you, you wanted to meet them.

17:11.663 --> 17:14.299
We finally get to this step.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.404
So how y'all doing?

17:18.470 --> 17:19.605
{\an3}I'm Milan.

17:19.671 --> 17:24.175
{\an8}Um, I'm Miles' boyfriend,
and, um...

17:24.242 --> 17:25.711
I've been wanting to
meet you guys

17:25.778 --> 17:28.446
because I thought
it was time for, you know,

17:28.513 --> 17:31.750
{\an1}us to come out to his family
like I've done with mine.

17:31.817 --> 17:35.187
{\an7}So your family
knows about... this.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.089
{\an5}Yes.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.089
Have you met them?

17:37.156 --> 17:39.091
{\an5}Not yet.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.091
{\an3}No.

17:39.158 --> 17:42.027
{\an4}Not yet.

17:39.158 --> 17:42.027
Not yet, why?

17:42.094 --> 17:44.296
'Cause my family
lives in Chicago.

17:44.363 --> 17:46.832
{\an5}And?

17:44.363 --> 17:46.832
{\an3}I mean...

17:46.899 --> 17:49.301
So what are your, uh,

17:49.368 --> 17:52.004
aspirations in life...

17:52.070 --> 17:54.139
besides stripping?

17:56.208 --> 17:59.044
{\an5}I understand what
you guys are coming from,
you know what I mean?

17:59.111 --> 18:02.581
{\an5}It's certain pictures
that I've took that are
a little salacious,

18:02.648 --> 18:04.983
so I know if you've seen
those, you know, but...

18:05.050 --> 18:07.152
Oh, yeah, I know what
your whole body look like.

18:07.219 --> 18:09.421
{\an5}(Milan)
Have I done some modeling?
Hell, yeah.

18:09.488 --> 18:11.790
The photos out there of me is no
different than the female models

18:11.857 --> 18:13.959
you see in "Maxim"
and all these other places.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.828
So what's with
the double standards?

18:15.894 --> 18:18.297
It's different stuff
that is salacious

18:18.363 --> 18:20.532
that, you know,
I've done and...

18:20.599 --> 18:24.269
Milan, sometimes you have to
have some morals and values

18:24.336 --> 18:26.738
about what you will do...

18:26.805 --> 18:30.209
{\an5}Mm-hmm.

18:26.805 --> 18:30.209
...to make it in this business.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.611
Giving up your morals
and your values

18:32.678 --> 18:34.112
shouldn't be one of 'em.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.414
But I don't want you
to think

18:35.481 --> 18:37.716
{\an1}because someone who's
comfortable with their body,

18:37.783 --> 18:40.486
you know, and has tooken
certain type of pictures,

18:40.552 --> 18:42.421
doesn't have
any moral capacity.

18:42.488 --> 18:44.289
But I can understand
where, you know,

18:44.356 --> 18:46.992
people who have different
values can say, you know,

18:47.059 --> 18:49.795
{\an1}I wouldn't do those things,
and I understand that.

18:49.862 --> 18:52.297
{\an5}Okay, you know...

18:49.862 --> 18:52.297
I can hear that, I can...

18:52.364 --> 18:54.199
{\an5}(Milan)
You know, it's really hard
for me to sit here

18:54.266 --> 18:55.901
and let Miles' family
jump down my throat,

18:55.968 --> 18:57.436
but I guess
I can understand.

18:57.503 --> 18:59.471
'Cause my family didn't take it
easy when I came out either.

18:59.538 --> 19:01.874
When I told my dad,
he kind of already knew.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.342
But when I told my mom,

19:03.408 --> 19:04.910
it was a whole nother
ballgame.

19:04.977 --> 19:06.778
So I know it's gonna take
some time getting used to,

19:06.845 --> 19:08.914
but I hope they can
accept me and us

19:08.981 --> 19:10.716
because I genuinely
love Miles.

19:10.782 --> 19:13.318
{\an4}It's hard for me to sit here
and have this conversation
with y'all

19:13.385 --> 19:15.187
because my own mother,

19:15.254 --> 19:17.756
basically, has disowned me
because of this situation.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.525
{\an1}Maybe it's 'cause the things
you continue to do

19:19.591 --> 19:20.926
{\an1}that you don't see
a problem with.

19:20.993 --> 19:23.295
{\an1}My mom doesn't know anything
about any of that.

19:23.362 --> 19:24.830
She knows about me
letting her know

19:24.897 --> 19:27.165
{\an1}that I was in love with a man,
and that's her issue.

19:27.232 --> 19:28.534
{\an1}Well, I have a problem
with that.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.570
{\an1}If you are for my brother,
then I'm 100% for that.

19:31.637 --> 19:32.838
That's my main concern.

19:32.905 --> 19:35.574
{\an1}If you are for him,
then I'm for you.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.009
{\an5}(Charlene) Right.

19:35.641 --> 19:37.009
{\an1}Okay?

19:37.075 --> 19:40.145
{\an1}That's how we get down because
our best interests is him.

19:40.212 --> 19:44.216
Not who or whoever else you hang
with or not like that, it's him.

19:44.283 --> 19:47.152
{\an1}And if he cool with you,
we cool with you.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.453
You need to understand that.

19:48.520 --> 19:49.988
If you gonna be
in this family,

19:50.055 --> 19:52.057
{\an1}then you need to understand
where the (bleep) we come from.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.593
{\an1}'Cause that's how we roll,
we roll with each other.

19:54.660 --> 19:57.062
{\an5}And with all of...

19:54.660 --> 19:57.062
So you need to understand that.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.298
{\an5}And with that said...

19:57.129 --> 19:59.298
And get used to seeing us.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.699
{\an5}Right.

19:59.364 --> 20:00.699
{\an1}Okay?

20:00.766 --> 20:02.200
{\an5}I don't mind seeing y'all.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.200
And know how we get down.

20:02.267 --> 20:03.502
{\an5}'Cause this is how we get down.

20:02.267 --> 20:03.502
I wanna see y'all.

20:03.569 --> 20:05.504
{\an1}So just know,
I'm looking out for him,

20:05.571 --> 20:08.473
{\an1}but now I'm looking out
for you, too, okay?

20:08.540 --> 20:10.108
Just know that.

20:10.175 --> 20:12.711
{\an5}(Milan)
This introduction was tough
by anyone's standards,

20:12.778 --> 20:14.613
and I didn't expect it
to be a walk in the park.

20:14.680 --> 20:17.115
But to hear Miles' family
accepts me and us,

20:17.182 --> 20:18.584
that's a huge deal for me.

20:18.650 --> 20:21.753
I'll be looking for my flowers
on Mother's Day and...

20:21.820 --> 20:24.890
Can we all stand up
and have hugs?

20:24.957 --> 20:27.059
{\an5}(Charlene) I love you.

20:24.957 --> 20:27.059
Can we have hugs, yes?

20:27.125 --> 20:29.595
{\an1}Because I love this boy
here to death.

20:29.661 --> 20:31.563
{\an5}Okay.

20:29.661 --> 20:31.563
Forever, come on, let's...

20:31.630 --> 20:33.966
{\an5}(Miles)
Everybody hug each other?

20:31.630 --> 20:33.966
...let's do a group hug.

20:34.032 --> 20:35.467
(Miles)
Group hug, yeah.

20:35.534 --> 20:39.371
{\an1}And you better not (bleep) up
because I will come at your ass.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.473
Without a doubt,
you know what I mean?

20:41.540 --> 20:43.208
Real talk.

20:43.275 --> 20:44.943
You ain't seen
the bad side of me yet.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.244
Oh, my God.

20:46.311 --> 20:47.379
I love you, too.

20:47.446 --> 20:50.048
{\an5}I've seen enough.

Yo, this bomb that Nikki
dropped on me

21:15.741 --> 21:17.609
got me feeling
all kinds of (bleep) up.

21:17.676 --> 21:19.478
The girl I'm supposed to be
ring shopping with

21:19.544 --> 21:20.779
is in love
with somebody else.

21:20.846 --> 21:22.214
{\an8}That's a huge betrayal.

21:22.280 --> 21:23.749
{\an8}I really do love this girl,

21:23.815 --> 21:25.217
{\an8}but this (bleep)
is embarrassing,

21:25.283 --> 21:26.918
{\an8}it's nuts,
and it hurts.

21:26.985 --> 21:28.220
I don't know what I'ma do,

21:28.286 --> 21:30.255
but I know I'm not
gonna do nothing.

21:30.322 --> 21:31.890
So what did you think?

21:31.957 --> 21:34.860
Aren't I so talented
and amazing and gorgeous?

21:34.926 --> 21:37.763
{\an8}Aren't I, like,
so all of the above

21:37.829 --> 21:40.365
{\an8}that I'm, like,
marriage material?

21:45.237 --> 21:47.039
I came out here...

21:47.105 --> 21:49.041
did all this stuff...

21:49.107 --> 21:50.909
{\an5}You did, and I acknowledge it.

21:49.107 --> 21:50.909
...that I was supposed to do.

21:50.976 --> 21:53.412
And...

21:55.213 --> 21:58.150
{\an1}I was different
than who I am, right?

21:58.216 --> 21:59.551
{\an5}What do you mean?

21:58.216 --> 21:59.551
{\an1}So...

21:59.618 --> 22:02.320
{\an5}I'm Richie.

21:59.618 --> 22:02.320
Okay.

22:02.387 --> 22:07.092
{\an1}But for what's important,
you wanna do things differently.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.794
{\an5}You have to change.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.794
Right.

22:08.860 --> 22:11.263
{\an5}So I thought that I did that.

22:08.860 --> 22:11.263
You did.

22:11.329 --> 22:13.899
{\an5}And I came out here...

22:11.329 --> 22:13.899
I'm not saying that you didn't.

22:13.965 --> 22:17.502
{\an1}...and all this has been
is an exercise

22:17.569 --> 22:20.672
{\an1}in why I should stay
the (bleep) of who I am.

22:20.739 --> 22:23.208
When I come out here

22:23.275 --> 22:25.544
and bend over backwards

22:25.610 --> 22:28.246
{\an1}and do all this (bleep)
that I was supposed to do

22:28.313 --> 22:29.881
{\an5}for a relationship...

22:28.313 --> 22:29.881
Yes.

22:29.948 --> 22:32.384
{\an5}I didn't say you didn't.

22:29.948 --> 22:32.384
...and I gotta go to a club

22:32.451 --> 22:34.186
where Nikki tells me

22:34.252 --> 22:38.023
{\an1}that you went to
your baby (bleep) father

22:38.090 --> 22:39.925
{\an1}and told that (bleep)
you love him

22:39.991 --> 22:42.194
{\an1}and you trying to figure out
what's going on

22:42.260 --> 22:44.429
{\an5}and what's the next steps.

22:42.260 --> 22:44.429
{\an3}What?

22:44.496 --> 22:46.665
{\an1}When did you feel like that
was important for me to know?

22:46.732 --> 22:48.233
{\an1}When was that gonna be
important for me to know?

22:48.300 --> 22:50.769
{\an5}Figure out the next steps
with what?

22:48.300 --> 22:50.769
{\an1}With him.

22:50.836 --> 22:52.304
No, I didn't say that.

22:52.370 --> 22:55.474
Come on, man.
Come on, man.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.843
{\an5}That's not what
I said at all.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.843
Come on, man.

22:57.909 --> 23:00.479
{\an5}I would definitely--

22:57.909 --> 23:00.479
{\an1}Everything has to be
on your time and when--

23:00.545 --> 23:01.713
how you wanna do it.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.482
{\an1}Things are always
Mo-Mo-Mo, Mo-Mo-Mo.

23:03.548 --> 23:04.916
{\an5}Everything is Mo-Mo-Mo.

23:03.548 --> 23:04.916
That's not true.

23:04.983 --> 23:08.520
{\an1}Yeah, it is, but now here
I am with this in hand

23:08.587 --> 23:11.089
coming here to tell you
that I (bleep) love you

23:11.156 --> 23:13.625
{\an1}and I want you
to be mine forever

23:13.692 --> 23:17.129
and I got some (bleep) news
about a (bleep) who-- who--

23:17.195 --> 23:18.964
{\an1}who you say
treats you like (bleep)!

23:19.030 --> 23:20.866
{\an1}But you needed to go
investigate that.

23:20.932 --> 23:23.335
You needed to go and-- and--
you needed closure for that.

23:23.401 --> 23:24.903
So it wasn't about me.

23:24.970 --> 23:26.805
{\an4}It wasn't about
moving forward with me.

23:24.970 --> 23:26.805
You know what?

23:26.872 --> 23:28.340
{\an1}It wasn't about
none of that, man.

23:28.406 --> 23:30.575
{\an1}It wasn't about
none of that!

23:30.642 --> 23:32.711
{\an1}Tell that (bleep) to give you
the mother(bleep) ring!

23:36.181 --> 23:38.183
(Moniece)
I'm in shock.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.618
The man I'm in love with,

23:39.684 --> 23:41.386
the man that I've been
planning a future with,

23:41.453 --> 23:43.288
finally gets to the point
of proposing

23:43.355 --> 23:44.990
and it's all gone
in an instant.

23:45.056 --> 23:48.593
Just like that, just because of
some stupid, impulsive decision

23:48.660 --> 23:50.495
to go talk to my baby daddy,

23:50.562 --> 23:53.031
knowing that that (bleep)
was probably gonna backfire.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.533
I'm devastated
that my future

23:54.599 --> 23:56.735
with the man
I'm in love with is gone.

23:56.802 --> 24:00.005
{\an5}And I don't think I'll ever
be able to forgive Nikki
for messing that all up.

24:00.071 --> 24:02.474
I think Nikki
has a death wish.

24:04.409 --> 24:05.811
{\an8}I would never hate
on your relationship

24:05.877 --> 24:07.612
{\an8}or throw salt
on your man.

24:05.877 --> 24:07.612
{\an5}You did, you did.

24:07.679 --> 24:09.281
{\an7}Because I ran into him--
Get your hand out of my face.

24:09.347 --> 24:11.216
{\an8}Y'all both,
y'all both need to...

24:09.347 --> 24:11.216
{\an5}(overlapping shouting)

24:11.283 --> 24:13.552
{\an8}(Brandi)
Get your (bleep) hands off
of Nikki, bitch.

Meeting Miles' family
was a bit much for me.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.756
But I'm glad at least now,
it seems like they accept me.

24:51.823 --> 24:54.893
Through all of us, the one thing
that kept me inspired

24:54.960 --> 24:56.795
has always been my music.

24:56.862 --> 24:58.330
{\an8}I've been grinding on it
all this time

24:58.396 --> 25:00.265
{\an8}and I got a whole bunch of
hot, new tracks.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.534
And today, I'm putting some
finishing touches on my vocals

25:02.601 --> 25:05.070
and my manager T.C.
is coming to check 'em out.

25:05.136 --> 25:07.572
Cut it.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.309
That (bleep) bomb, bro.

25:11.376 --> 25:13.044
All right, um, give me
like five seconds.

25:13.111 --> 25:16.414
{\an5}All right, hey, babe.

25:13.111 --> 25:16.414
What's going on with you?

25:16.481 --> 25:18.516
{\an5}Good to see you,
good to see you.

25:16.481 --> 25:18.516
Good to see you.

25:18.583 --> 25:21.553
{\an8}So what you think?

25:18.583 --> 25:21.553
{\an8}I like it, I like it.

25:21.620 --> 25:22.921
{\an5}It's dope, right?

25:21.620 --> 25:22.921
Yeah, it's dope.

25:22.988 --> 25:24.723
{\an8}Yeah, that emotion's in there.

25:22.988 --> 25:24.723
{\an8}I believe your ass, too.

25:24.789 --> 25:26.925
{\an7}You're taking all
your (bleep) if you ever go.

25:26.992 --> 25:29.628
So what's going on
with you?

25:29.694 --> 25:33.732
{\an4}I ended up going to meet
with Miles' family.

25:29.694 --> 25:33.732
{\an3}Right.

25:33.798 --> 25:35.567
{\an1}And, um,
it was different.

25:35.634 --> 25:38.236
{\an1}You know, they brought up
my pictures and just stuff.

25:38.303 --> 25:41.640
{\an1}I'm like, I'm a model,
so is it-- is it okay that--

25:41.706 --> 25:45.410
{\an4}I mean, I've took nude pictures
or maybe show my ass
or some (bleep),

25:45.477 --> 25:46.912
{\an1}and a woman can do it,
but I can't?

25:46.978 --> 25:48.580
Like double standards,
you know what I mean?

25:48.647 --> 25:50.649
{\an4}Like...

25:48.647 --> 25:50.649
I mean, your ass probably
look better than theirs...

25:50.715 --> 25:52.617
{\an4}Yeah, so that's probably
what it was.

25:50.715 --> 25:52.617
{\an3}(laughing)

25:52.684 --> 25:55.787
{\an1}Um, you know, so that was
like just crazy for me,

25:55.854 --> 25:58.156
{\an1}but, you know, at the end
of the day, it was cool

25:58.223 --> 26:01.526
{\an4}'cause we ended up kind of
coming to some type of
understanding.

26:01.593 --> 26:02.961
{\an6}Okay.

26:01.593 --> 26:02.961
{\an1}And, um...

26:03.028 --> 26:04.396
I ain't even tripping 'cause
the moral of the story for me

26:04.462 --> 26:07.332
{\an1}is like, you know, if I can
help Miles come out,

26:07.399 --> 26:09.367
{\an1}I feel like I can
help a lot of people

26:09.434 --> 26:11.937
move to their true self

26:12.003 --> 26:13.438
{\an1}and be their authentic self,
you know?

26:13.505 --> 26:16.274
Whether it's with the music
or whether it's with just me

26:16.341 --> 26:18.944
{\an1}personally because
I know when I came out,

26:19.010 --> 26:21.313
I was like 14 or 13.

26:21.379 --> 26:24.649
{\an5}And the first person I told was
my little brother who was nine.

26:21.379 --> 26:24.649
{\an3}Okay.

26:24.716 --> 26:28.586
{\an1}And he kept asking me,
"Why you don't play with me.

26:28.653 --> 26:30.855
{\an1}Why you don't like doing
the same things I do?"

26:30.922 --> 26:32.190
{\an1}You know,
all those questions.

26:32.257 --> 26:35.260
{\an1}And I'm just like,
"Bro, like, I'm different."

26:35.327 --> 26:37.462
{\an1}And he's like, "What do you
mean you're different?"

26:37.529 --> 26:39.831
And I'm like, "I'm gay."

26:39.898 --> 26:42.867
{\an1}And he's like, "Okay, well,
you're still my brother,

26:42.934 --> 26:45.337
{\an4}I still love you, and I still
want you to play with me."

26:42.934 --> 26:45.337
{\an3}Right.

26:45.403 --> 26:47.072
{\an5}And it's like...

26:45.403 --> 26:47.072
Real simple with him.

26:47.138 --> 26:48.340
{\an5}You don't just...

26:47.138 --> 26:48.340
{\an3}Real, yeah.

26:48.406 --> 26:49.841
{\an4}Black or white,
you know what I mean?

26:48.406 --> 26:49.841
Yeah.

26:49.908 --> 26:51.943
And from that point on,

26:52.010 --> 26:53.845
I was like, wow,
you know, like,

26:53.912 --> 26:56.915
{\an4}this is what true love is,
you know what I mean?

26:53.912 --> 26:56.915
{\an3}Yeah.

26:56.982 --> 27:00.452
{\an1}And, um, four years later,
my little brother passed away.

27:00.518 --> 27:03.254
So ever since that day,

27:03.321 --> 27:06.024
{\an1}I basically
just vowed to be me.

27:06.091 --> 27:08.526
You know, my life
had its ups and downs.

27:08.593 --> 27:11.629
And the one thing I can say,
I've always lived my truth.

27:11.696 --> 27:13.698
And you know, that may be hard
for people to accept,

27:13.765 --> 27:15.367
but the truth
is always better.

27:15.433 --> 27:18.003
No matter what, you can
still do the right thing,

27:18.069 --> 27:19.504
you can still be successful,

27:19.571 --> 27:21.206
and you can still
live in your truth.

27:21.272 --> 27:23.842
And I think being you,
your authentic self,

27:23.908 --> 27:25.276
is more than enough.

27:25.343 --> 27:26.711
{\an1}That's my message
to the world.

27:26.778 --> 27:28.279
I think that's
a phenomenal message.

27:28.346 --> 27:31.683
{\an1}Because a lot of people,
you know, are really scared

27:31.750 --> 27:33.685
about their actual
real talents

27:33.752 --> 27:35.887
{\an1}because they feel like something
is truly wrong with them

27:35.954 --> 27:37.622
{\an5}because they're gay.

27:35.954 --> 27:37.622
Because of society.

27:37.689 --> 27:39.057
{\an5}Because of society.

27:37.689 --> 27:39.057
{\an1}Yeah.

27:39.124 --> 27:40.725
So I think, you know,
exactly what you're saying

27:40.792 --> 27:42.761
and where your direction
is right now

27:42.827 --> 27:44.429
is just in
the right place.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.732
{\an4}And it's dope that, like,
I can get back in here.

27:44.496 --> 27:47.732
{\an3}Exactly.

27:47.799 --> 27:50.835
{\an1}I can put all my mind
and my soul back into my music,

27:50.902 --> 27:53.071
{\an4}'cause that's
the most important thing.

27:50.902 --> 27:53.071
{\an3}Good.

27:53.138 --> 27:55.140
{\an5}I'm here for it, I'm ready.

27:53.138 --> 27:55.140
I know, I can feel--

27:55.206 --> 27:57.475
{\an5}It's time to take off.

27:55.206 --> 27:57.475
Your energy is different.

27:57.542 --> 27:58.877
{\an3}I like it.

27:58.943 --> 28:00.645
{\an6}Cha-ching.

27:58.943 --> 28:00.645
{\an1}Cha-ching.

28:00.712 --> 28:01.980
(both laughing)

28:02.047 --> 28:03.114
{\an5}Let's get this money.

28:02.047 --> 28:03.114
{\an1}All right.

28:03.181 --> 28:04.816
{\an5}I love you.

28:03.181 --> 28:04.816
I love you, too.

28:04.883 --> 28:06.818
♪♪

28:10.422 --> 28:12.257
{\an1}Oh, yeah, that's what
I'm doing tonight.

28:12.323 --> 28:13.992
{\an1}There it goes, there goes
the Honda Center.

28:14.059 --> 28:16.094
{\an1}(laughing)
Hey, I'll see you later!

28:16.161 --> 28:18.229
{\an6}Omari!

28:16.161 --> 28:18.229
{\an1}Later on!

28:18.296 --> 28:20.732
{\an5}You get on my nerves,
seriously.

28:18.296 --> 28:20.732
{\an1}Yeah.

28:20.799 --> 28:24.035
{\an8}I can't even tell you how many
miles we've clocked on this bus.

28:24.102 --> 28:27.472
{\an8}It's a new city every day,
it's a new venue every night,

28:27.539 --> 28:30.942
{\an8}and at the end of the day,
it just all becomes a blur.

28:31.009 --> 28:33.244
{\an7}How you feeling, baby?
You enjoy it?

28:33.311 --> 28:34.813
{\an1}Are you enjoying the tour?
I mean, what?

28:34.879 --> 28:36.981
{\an5}Talk to me.

28:34.879 --> 28:36.981
It's been fun.

28:37.048 --> 28:40.151
I just wanna start feeling like
I'm doing something for myself.

28:40.218 --> 28:43.254
{\an1}You don't know what that's like
because you're doing it.

28:43.321 --> 28:45.990
But I just feel like--
Like I said to you before,

28:46.057 --> 28:48.326
when is my time gonna come,
as far as just me working?

28:48.393 --> 28:50.795
And I feel like it's not gonna
happen unless I make it happen.

28:50.862 --> 28:54.232
{\an8}I can't believe that Apryl is
like on my head talking about,

28:54.299 --> 28:57.268
{\an8}"Well, baby, you know, are we
gonna do work on my project?"

28:57.335 --> 28:59.671
{\an8}I'm like, baby, look,
it's all about timing.

28:59.737 --> 29:02.874
Because I'ma make sure that she
gets everything that she wants.

29:02.941 --> 29:04.542
She just gotta know
I got her back.

29:04.609 --> 29:06.244
And we gonna
make this happen.

29:06.311 --> 29:09.080
{\an1}How far do you think this'll go,
like, realistically?

29:09.147 --> 29:11.082
Within the next
five years.

29:11.149 --> 29:12.817
{\an1}You think it's gonna
take that long?

29:12.884 --> 29:14.385
You're out of your mind.

29:14.452 --> 29:16.387
{\an5}I gotta bounce back.

29:14.452 --> 29:16.387
You bounced.

29:16.454 --> 29:18.123
No, I gots to
lift up the butt.

29:18.189 --> 29:20.191
I gots to squeeze
in the stomach.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.793
I gots to get these...

29:21.860 --> 29:24.963
I gotta get these things
right, okay?

29:25.029 --> 29:27.799
{\an1}The most important place that
you could be right now is here.

29:27.866 --> 29:29.701
{\an1}You know,
your contributions

29:29.767 --> 29:31.736
{\an1}to helping me do
what I'm doing right now.

29:31.803 --> 29:33.071
And aside from that,

29:33.138 --> 29:35.473
{\an1}I completely understand
how you feel.

29:37.308 --> 29:40.245
It's like, I just
wanna get back to me

29:40.311 --> 29:43.081
and like what I enjoy
and what I like.

29:43.148 --> 29:44.115
But it's like...

29:44.182 --> 29:45.583
{\an1}Hold on, stop right there,
hold on.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.285
{\an1}Let's stop the bus
real quick.

29:47.352 --> 29:49.053
Man, you always
cut me off!

29:49.120 --> 29:50.421
Yeah, I know, sorry.

29:50.488 --> 29:51.890
{\an1}Yeah, we gonna stop
right here.

29:51.956 --> 29:53.858
{\an1}This where we gonna stop at,
all right?

29:53.925 --> 29:56.794
{\an4}Let's get off the bus,
come on.

29:53.925 --> 29:56.794
{\an3}Why?

30:00.031 --> 30:01.933
{\an5}Where are we at?

30:00.031 --> 30:01.933
{\an3}(laughing)

30:02.000 --> 30:03.468
What you mean
"where we at," baby?

30:03.535 --> 30:05.637
What does it say
right there?

31:59.717 --> 32:01.719
{\an8}But that's not why
I came here tonight.

32:01.786 --> 32:03.388
{\an8}I knew that Nikki
was gonna be here.

32:03.454 --> 32:05.256
{\an8}And after she ruined my
engagement with Rich,

32:05.323 --> 32:08.459
{\an8}I wanted to see what the botch
Barbie had to say for herself.

32:08.526 --> 32:10.528
{\an4}Hello.

32:08.526 --> 32:10.528
Hi, girlfriend.

32:10.595 --> 32:12.897
{\an1}How are you?
Good to see you.

32:12.964 --> 32:14.632
{\an5}Hi, honey, how are you?

32:12.964 --> 32:14.632
{\an1}Good.

32:14.699 --> 32:16.334
{\an4}Question.

32:14.699 --> 32:16.334
{\an3}What's up?

32:16.401 --> 32:18.036
{\an1}So let's just skip
the pleasantries

32:18.102 --> 32:20.204
{\an5}and get right to it.

32:18.102 --> 32:20.204
Okay, go ahead.

32:20.271 --> 32:23.641
{\an8}So, um, when I saw you
at the video shoot...

32:20.271 --> 32:23.641
{\an6}Right.

32:23.708 --> 32:27.111
{\an7}...were you present for
my conversation with Dreux?

32:23.708 --> 32:27.111
{\an6}No.

32:27.178 --> 32:28.746
{\an4}No, right?

32:27.178 --> 32:28.746
{\an3}No.

32:28.813 --> 32:31.883
{\an1}So did you hear
from my mouth

32:31.949 --> 32:33.918
{\an5}anything that was said.

32:31.949 --> 32:33.918
Absolutely not.

32:33.985 --> 32:35.053
{\an4}No?

32:33.985 --> 32:35.053
No, but--

32:35.119 --> 32:37.221
{\an5}So when you ran into my man...

32:35.119 --> 32:37.221
{\an3}Right.

32:37.288 --> 32:38.990
{\an1}...and you stuck your nose
in my business...

32:39.057 --> 32:40.958
{\an4}I would never stick my nose
in your business.

32:39.057 --> 32:40.958
...and it caused me

32:41.025 --> 32:42.660
{\an4}to get a ring
thrown in my face.

32:41.025 --> 32:42.660
{\an3}Listen--

32:42.727 --> 32:44.095
{\an5}I'm not done.

32:42.727 --> 32:44.095
{\an3}Okay.

32:44.162 --> 32:46.731
{\an1}That kind of (bleep) gets
people (bleep) up on the daily.

32:46.798 --> 32:49.000
{\an5}You understand? So don't--

32:46.798 --> 32:49.000
Well, you should talk
to your baby daddy...

32:49.067 --> 32:50.201
{\an5}No, no, no, no...

32:49.067 --> 32:50.201
...'cause he's the one
that told me that.

32:50.268 --> 32:51.969
What's this?
Moniece, Moniece.

32:52.036 --> 32:54.038
{\an1}When I ran into Rich,
it was a casual conversation.

32:54.105 --> 32:55.506
I would never hate
on your relationship

32:55.573 --> 32:56.974
or throw salt
on your man or you.

32:57.041 --> 32:58.309
{\an5}At the end of the day--

32:57.041 --> 32:58.309
Nobody said that.

32:58.376 --> 32:59.677
{\an1}Nobody said that
that was the intention.

32:59.744 --> 33:01.346
"You're sticking your nose
in the business"...

33:01.412 --> 33:03.581
Why are y'all coming and ruining
this (bleep) right now?

33:03.648 --> 33:06.784
{\an1}But when he tells me, "Nikki,
I heard that my baby mama

33:06.851 --> 33:08.319
told me she still
in love with me."

33:08.386 --> 33:09.821
{\an1}That's a conversation between
y'all two, speak with him.

33:09.887 --> 33:12.423
{\an1}But he didn't go back to Rich
and tell Rich anything, you did.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.691
{\an5}Because I ran into him.

33:12.490 --> 33:13.691
{\an1}You did.

33:13.758 --> 33:15.393
{\an5}Get your hand out of
my face, honey.

33:13.758 --> 33:15.393
{\an1}You did.

33:15.460 --> 33:16.627
{\an5}Get your hand out of my face.

33:15.460 --> 33:16.627
So the next time...

33:16.694 --> 33:18.396
Y'all both-- y'all both
need to chill out.

33:18.463 --> 33:20.531

34:24.962 --> 34:26.998
I really thought
we turned over a new leaf

34:27.063 --> 34:29.534
and she was beginning to be
more of an adult.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.369
But watching her
go after Nikki like that,

34:31.436 --> 34:33.204
it's just kind of
disappointing.

34:33.271 --> 34:34.806

34:47.118 --> 34:48.985

34:51.889 --> 34:54.625
{\an4}Right.

Max and I have had some rough

a hard time about her music,

but it's only 'cause I know
how great she could be.

This has been the toughest
year of my life.

38:21.399 --> 38:23.701
I've revealed more of
myself to the world

38:23.768 --> 38:25.803
than I ever thought
possible.

38:25.870 --> 38:28.272
I can't say that I handled
everything perfectly.

38:28.339 --> 38:29.874
There's no manual to this.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.909
I did everything
the best way that I could.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.712
And I know I hurt people by
telling them who I really am,

38:34.779 --> 38:37.748

for doing it.

It's been a lot of ups and downs
for me and Miles this year.

38:52.930 --> 38:54.598
And I can't believe
where we're at right now.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.333
But as hard as
this journey was,

38:56.400 --> 38:58.536
it made me understand a lot
about our relationship.

38:58.602 --> 39:00.171
You know,
we're not quite there yet,

39:00.237 --> 39:03.607
but I'm just happy Miles
is out and living his truth.

39:03.674 --> 39:06.977

to be wedding bells and kids,

39:07.044 --> 39:08.612

It's been a hard year.

39:25.029 --> 39:27.598
I suffered the biggest
heartbreak in my life

39:27.665 --> 39:29.100
and I'm still standing.

39:29.166 --> 39:32.603
And I'm putting all that pain
and drama into my music.

39:32.670 --> 39:35.039
And because the most important
thing in my life

39:35.106 --> 39:37.074
is to set a great example
for Zoe,

39:37.141 --> 39:39.410
I'm showing her,

39:39.477 --> 39:42.480
you pick your ass right up off

Now after New Orleans,
after the apartment,

the Teairra Mari drama,

39:58.562 --> 40:00.164
the last thing I wanna do

And I know that
he loves me, too.

that he's really trying.

I can't lie, my life
has been good this year.

40:28.425 --> 40:30.961
Business is thriving,
my music is on point,

40:31.028 --> 40:33.230
and I got a whole lot of
projects popping.

40:33.297 --> 40:35.065
But one thing I learned

40:35.132 --> 40:37.501
is that none of this
means nothing

40:37.568 --> 40:39.970
without Princess Love
by my side.

40:40.037 --> 40:42.339
What me and Princess
had was special.

brick by brick,

40:44.241 --> 40:47.578
I'm rebuilding a love
and gaining her trust back.

40:47.645 --> 40:51.015
And believe this, I'm never
gonna let an outside influence

40:51.081 --> 40:52.850
come between us again.

40:52.917 --> 40:55.085
I wanna give her
something special,
