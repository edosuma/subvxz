00:09.834 --> 00:13.375
to the top of the rock wall

00:13.417 --> 00:15.083
in record time yesterday.

00:15.125 --> 00:17.375
How come you didn't post

00:15.125 --> 00:17.375

00:17.417 --> 00:20.125
- Oh,

I don't like to brag online.

00:20.166 --> 00:22.166
I like to brag in person.

So who has four thumbs

00:22.208 --> 00:25.834

This girl!

01:04.417 --> 01:05.792
- This is very confusing.

01:05.834 --> 01:07.417
- I know what's going on here.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.625
See, Ricky added

01:07.458 --> 01:09.625
an "iac" to "Zayn"

01:09.667 --> 01:12.333
to make what's known

01:09.667 --> 01:12.333
as a "nickname."

01:12.375 --> 01:15.834

- Oh.

01:19.917 --> 01:21.375
Yeah, no idea.

01:23.667 --> 01:24.417
- Hey, guys.

01:25.125 --> 01:27.166
Dawn, did you get my text

01:25.125 --> 01:27.166
about Glee Club rehearsal?

01:27.208 --> 01:28.458
- Yeah, and check this out.

01:28.500 --> 01:30.458
When I got it,

01:28.500 --> 01:30.458
I was also texting Mae

01:30.500 --> 01:32.375
on a tablet with my other hand,

01:32.417 --> 01:33.750
so I said to my mom, I'm like,

01:33.792 --> 01:36.208
"Hey, look, I'm ambi-text-rous!"

01:38.625 --> 01:40.125
- Dawn, that happened to Ricky.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.041
- He's the one

01:40.250 --> 01:42.041
who said "ambi-text-rous."

01:42.083 --> 01:44.000
- What? Ricky didn't say that.

01:44.041 --> 01:46.041
He's barely "text-rous."

01:46.083 --> 01:47.709
- Pretty sure he did.

01:47.750 --> 01:49.917
He posted it

01:47.750 --> 01:49.917
on his FaceShack page.

01:49.959 --> 01:52.917
- He even hashtagged it

01:49.959 --> 01:52.917
"RickyLife."

01:52.959 --> 01:55.125
So it's definitely Ricky's life.

01:55.166 --> 01:57.417
"Ambi-text-rous"!

01:57.458 --> 01:58.959

02:01.041 --> 02:04.250
He posted my story

02:01.041 --> 02:04.250

02:04.291 --> 02:06.083
Wait, did you guys

02:04.291 --> 02:06.083

02:06.125 --> 02:08.250
- No, we're not

02:08.291 --> 02:09.458
- Yeah, we live with him.

We don't want

02:09.500 --> 02:11.250

02:11.291 --> 02:12.792
- Yeah, well, maybe you should,

02:12.834 --> 02:15.166
because I'm not the only one

02:12.834 --> 02:15.166
he stole from.

02:15.208 --> 02:16.917

02:30.917 --> 02:31.792
I thought of that. Here.

02:31.834 --> 02:33.250
Go ahead, smell.

02:33.291 --> 02:35.125
- Pass.

- Your loss.

That's why

08:56.000 --> 08:58.750

- See, no one will ever know

08:58.792 --> 09:01.417
who BoCo is

09:01.458 --> 09:05.875

09:01.458 --> 09:05.875
be... shrouded in mystery.

I'm out.

Now, back to my pie.

- Ooh, I've got a thing

20:00.709 --> 20:04.208
this Saturday.

20:04.250 --> 20:05.625
- Yeah, I mean, is there any way

20:05.667 --> 20:07.291
we can just settle this

20:05.667 --> 20:07.291
right now?

20:07.333 --> 20:09.000
- Like, closer to the ground?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.208
- Walk on hot coals!

20:11.250 --> 20:12.667
Again, I don't know

20:11.250 --> 20:12.667
who said that,

20:12.709 --> 20:14.291
but it's a great idea.

20:14.333 --> 20:16.000
Since BoCo already did it once,

20:16.041 --> 20:17.709
it shouldn't be a problem.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.542
all: Yeah!

20:19.583 --> 20:23.250
- True, true, I would definitely

20:19.583 --> 20:23.250
walk on hot coals again...

20:23.291 --> 20:25.709
if we had any,

20:23.291 --> 20:25.709
but since we don't--

20:25.750 --> 20:27.959
- I've got hot tots!

20:28.000 --> 20:29.959
Fresh out of the oven.

20:30.000 --> 20:31.667
They'll do the job!

20:31.709 --> 20:33.375
[laughter]

20:33.417 --> 20:36.083
all: [chanting]

20:33.417 --> 20:36.083
Hot tots! Hot tots!

20:43.917 --> 20:45.125
- Uh, what's this for?

20:45.166 --> 20:47.834
- Oh, you'll know.

20:47.875 --> 20:49.333
- Wait, hold on.

20:49.375 --> 20:51.625
Let me just make sure

20:49.375 --> 20:51.625
these tots are hot.

20:51.667 --> 20:53.750
Oh, hot! Hot!

20:53.792 --> 20:57.417
[yelling, sighing]

20:57.458 --> 20:59.709
- You were right.

20:57.458 --> 20:59.709
I did know.

20:59.750 --> 21:03.542
- Okay, on FaceShack,

20:59.750 --> 21:03.542
BoCo talked the talk.

21:03.583 --> 21:07.375
Now it's time to see

21:03.583 --> 21:07.375
who can walk the walk.

21:07.417 --> 21:09.959
all: [chanting]

21:07.417 --> 21:09.959
Tot walk! Tot walk!

21:10.000 --> 21:12.750
- Okay, now's your chance

21:10.000 --> 21:12.750
to chicken out.

21:12.792 --> 21:14.959
- I'm not chickening out.

21:12.792 --> 21:14.959
- Yeah, me neither.

21:15.000 --> 21:18.625
all: [chanting]

21:15.000 --> 21:18.625
Tot walk! Tot walk!

21:18.667 --> 21:19.792
- Stop!

21:19.834 --> 21:21.917
Stop the tot walk!

21:21.959 --> 21:24.041
This is ridiculous.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.959
And it's all my fault.

21:26.000 --> 21:29.375
They only created BoCo

21:26.000 --> 21:29.375
to take me down

21:29.417 --> 21:32.041
because I stole their stories

21:29.417 --> 21:32.041
and pretended they were mine.

21:32.083 --> 21:33.542
[all gasp]

21:33.583 --> 21:35.834
- It's true.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.834
- All him.

21:35.875 --> 21:41.917
- So #RickyLife

21:35.875 --> 21:41.917
was actually #TheirLives.

21:41.959 --> 21:46.166
But I learned something today,

21:41.959 --> 21:46.166
and it's a lesson for us all.

21:46.208 --> 21:49.667
It's better to be less popular

21:46.208 --> 21:49.667
for who you really are

21:49.709 --> 21:52.959
than more popular

21:49.709 --> 21:52.959
for something you're... not!

21:53.000 --> 21:54.750
Hot tots! Hot tots!

21:54.792 --> 21:58.083
- You know what it's for,

21:54.792 --> 21:58.083
people!

21:58.125 --> 22:01.875
- [screaming]

22:01.917 --> 22:04.709
- Ooh, I'm gonna get

22:01.917 --> 22:04.709
a lot of knocks for this one!
