00:01.026 --> 00:04.026
Are you here to pick a Prime
Minister? Or deal with your son?

00:07.060 --> 00:09.676
Did you take care of that
situation with your mother?

00:09.700 --> 00:12.116
Tell your father.
I refuse.

00:12.140 --> 00:13.236
I can't...

00:13.260 --> 00:15.436
You're not aware of who
I was previously married to?

00:15.460 --> 00:16.636
No money? No lies?

00:16.660 --> 00:17.876
What's left?

00:17.900 --> 00:19.396
The truth. Can she win?

00:19.420 --> 00:21.116
She'd need all our support.

00:21.140 --> 00:22.516
I took the story to Caden.

00:22.540 --> 00:23.956
You know what he says?

00:23.980 --> 00:25.676
It was a robbery gone wrong.

00:25.700 --> 00:28.700
Don't tell me
what you think I want to hear.

00:28.940 --> 00:30.516
You can't do it, can you?

00:30.540 --> 00:33.540
Why do you make it so hard?

02:43.260 --> 02:46.260
I lost a daughter.

02:46.940 --> 02:49.940
We lost our daughter.

02:50.540 --> 02:53.396
Six months into the pregnancy.

02:53.420 --> 02:54.716
I went in for a check-up,

02:54.740 --> 02:57.740
and they couldn't find
her heartbeat.

02:59.620 --> 03:02.620
My world fell apart.

03:03.620 --> 03:05.916
And yours did, too.

03:05.940 --> 03:08.940
But we continued to host
prime ministers and presidents.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.860
I drank and took drugs for a time.

03:18.260 --> 03:21.260
So I could still play
the part of your wife.

03:22.140 --> 03:25.140
So I could stand by your side
and smile and joke...

03:27.660 --> 03:30.660
...when all I felt was grief.

03:32.180 --> 03:35.180
To say that drink and drugs were the
reason that my little girl died...

03:36.980 --> 03:39.756
...it's a lie.

03:39.780 --> 03:42.780
It's the worst lie that's
ever been told about me.

03:42.900 --> 03:45.900
It was not the reason
our daughter died.

03:46.740 --> 03:49.740
I was not the reason.

03:52.100 --> 03:55.100
Now you know...

03:56.380 --> 03:59.380
...you tell them.

04:02.620 --> 04:05.620
Please, you tell them right now.

04:10.380 --> 04:13.380
How can we be sure?

04:15.700 --> 04:18.700
God!

04:20.899 --> 04:23.716
You'd do anything.

04:23.740 --> 04:26.740
You'd say anything.

04:27.620 --> 04:30.620
To use the loss of one child
to take another.

04:34.940 --> 04:37.940
We go to court.

04:42.340 --> 04:44.236
As for this - no.

04:44.260 --> 04:45.956
I won't be blackmailed.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.596
We'll fight in the open.

04:47.620 --> 04:49.156
You'll say terrible things about me.

04:49.180 --> 04:51.676
I understand. It's a fight.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.756
So we will go to court,

04:53.780 --> 04:56.780
where I will petition, as my son's
mother, who has only ever done

04:58.020 --> 05:01.020
what's right for him, a boy who
I love very much, for full custody!

05:03.580 --> 05:05.636
And I will throw everything
I have into this fight,

05:05.660 --> 05:08.660
not because I am proud or
because I've been humiliated,

05:08.980 --> 05:11.980
but because he's my son!

05:13.300 --> 05:16.300
You want to fight
because you're a fighter.

05:17.140 --> 05:19.756
And a devoted mother.

05:19.780 --> 05:21.676
You can choose to lose well.

05:21.700 --> 05:23.196
You can choose to lose badly.

05:23.220 --> 05:25.556
But you cannot win.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.276
You go to court, you will lose.

05:28.300 --> 05:30.436
I know you don't
care about the money.

05:30.460 --> 05:33.460
But any matter concerning Caden,
visitation rights,

05:34.940 --> 05:37.036
is as generous as it
can possibly be.

05:37.060 --> 05:40.060
And give you complete control
over our son's upbringing?

05:41.820 --> 05:44.820
If you turn this down out of anger,
you'll be making a mistake,

05:46.180 --> 05:49.180
for you and for Caden, because
all of this will come out.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.596
It will be in every paper.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.676
Not mine.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.636
I'm not going to publish any of it.

05:55.660 --> 05:57.596
But my enemies will.

05:57.620 --> 06:00.316
Our son will watch us fight,

06:00.340 --> 06:02.396
watch you lose.

06:02.420 --> 06:05.420
He will hate me, yes,
but he'll hate you too.

06:06.180 --> 06:08.396
And for what? For what?

06:08.420 --> 06:11.420
So you can get some comfort out
of knowing that you weren't weak?

06:13.780 --> 06:16.780
So that you can call yourself
a fighter? Ask your lawyer.

06:19.340 --> 06:22.340
Take counsel.

06:23.140 --> 06:26.140
Kathryn, I beg you.

06:50.980 --> 06:53.980
Tell me...

06:56.180 --> 06:59.180
...were you planning for the end
from the beginning?

07:02.180 --> 07:05.180
I almost admire you for it.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.500
And am I being fired as your wife?
Or as Caden's mother?

07:21.540 --> 07:24.540
As his mother?

07:31.340 --> 07:33.636
I don't want you to go!

07:33.660 --> 07:35.996
Please!

07:36.020 --> 07:39.020
I don't want you to go.

07:39.140 --> 07:42.140
I don't want you to go.

07:44.340 --> 07:46.076
Caden, listen to me.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.036
I want to stay with you.

07:48.060 --> 07:49.636
I know.

07:49.660 --> 07:50.876
Why can't I stay with you?

07:50.900 --> 07:52.556
We spoke about this.

07:52.580 --> 07:53.996
Let me stay with you.

07:54.020 --> 07:57.020
Caden, we'll see each
other all the time.

07:57.500 --> 08:00.500
Make him stop.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.940
I can't. I don't want you to go!

08:05.460 --> 08:07.316
I don't want you to go! I'm sorry.

08:07.340 --> 08:10.340
Come on, Caden. Come on.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.996
It'll be all right.

08:18.020 --> 08:21.020
Mum!

08:42.860 --> 08:45.860
I'm so sorry!

08:47.660 --> 08:50.660
I'm so sorry!

09:17.180 --> 09:20.180
Your son will face
significant challenges -

09:21.340 --> 09:24.340
speech, mobility,
memory, temperament.

09:25.140 --> 09:26.556
What do you mean by temperament?

09:26.580 --> 09:28.476
His self-control.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.676
His manner.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.396
How he interacts with other people.

09:33.420 --> 09:36.420
Some families talk of loved
ones seeming different.

09:37.180 --> 09:39.676
Different?

09:39.700 --> 09:40.916
How?

09:40.940 --> 09:43.940
They might be rude
when they were polite.

09:44.260 --> 09:46.996
Aggressive when they were gentle.

09:47.020 --> 09:50.020
Indiscreet when they were tactful.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.236
Indiscreet...

09:53.260 --> 09:56.260
When you say indiscreet,
what do you mean by that?

09:56.300 --> 09:59.300
The frontotemporal cortices
govern self-control.

09:59.420 --> 10:01.996
And this part of your son's
brain suffered significant

10:02.020 --> 10:04.876
damage during the stroke.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.156
You might call it a filter.

10:07.180 --> 10:09.036
How we judge what to say,

10:09.060 --> 10:11.556
and what not to say.

10:11.580 --> 10:13.876
And without this filter,

10:13.900 --> 10:16.900
every thought can become a speech.

10:22.420 --> 10:25.316
He'll still be our son.

10:25.340 --> 10:28.340
What does that even mean,
people change?

10:29.300 --> 10:31.396
You've changed. I've changed.

10:31.420 --> 10:32.596
This will change him.

10:32.620 --> 10:35.620
Maybe it's easier to accept he might be different
when you never really knew him in the first place.

10:37.260 --> 10:40.036
I never knew him? You only ever knew
him as the man you wanted him to be.

10:40.060 --> 10:42.156
You only knew him as a boy, a baby!

10:42.180 --> 10:44.076
Yes, you made sure of that!

10:44.100 --> 10:47.100
This experience places
tremendous strain on families.

10:47.460 --> 10:50.396
Oh, this family's only ever
experienced great strain.

10:50.420 --> 10:51.676
That's not true.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.996
It is not true.

10:54.020 --> 10:57.020
Very clever, witty, a little cruel.

10:57.460 --> 11:00.460
But it's not true.

11:29.140 --> 11:30.236
My name is Tate.

11:30.260 --> 11:33.260
I'm in charge of the security
surrounding your son.

11:34.020 --> 11:37.020
Why does Caden need a guard?

11:41.100 --> 11:44.100
Right now, a photograph of your
son's face would fetch £20,000.

11:45.860 --> 11:48.860
There's already been several unauthorised
attempts to access his medical records.

11:50.220 --> 11:53.220
Who's doing that? Other papers?

11:53.540 --> 11:54.716
Can they do that?

11:54.740 --> 11:57.740
I don't know. I don't know.

12:20.380 --> 12:23.380
Kathryn?

12:23.500 --> 12:26.076
Sofia?

12:26.100 --> 12:28.716
Max is... I'll go find him.

12:28.740 --> 12:31.316
Oh, no. Wait.

12:31.340 --> 12:33.996
Please.

12:34.020 --> 12:37.020
He's going to be all right.

12:37.900 --> 12:40.900
Hi.

12:40.980 --> 12:43.980
Hi, mi amor.

12:46.980 --> 12:49.980
I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah.

13:04.620 --> 13:06.796
How many months?

13:06.820 --> 13:07.836
Three.

13:07.860 --> 13:10.276
Oh, I'm so pleased for you.

13:10.300 --> 13:11.316
For both of you.

13:11.340 --> 13:14.340
Thank you.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.580
I've brought you some things...

14:37.420 --> 14:40.420
...from when you were a child.

14:57.500 --> 15:00.500
It's your feather.

15:01.340 --> 15:04.340
Can you remember feeding those
swans in Regent's Park?

15:07.300 --> 15:10.300
And when they flapped their wings,
all the other children ran away.

15:13.260 --> 15:16.260
Not you.

15:16.380 --> 15:19.380
You said you wanted it to have the
bread more than you were frightened.

15:20.540 --> 15:23.540
So you stayed.

15:24.980 --> 15:27.980
Oh, darling!

15:28.580 --> 15:31.580
I don't know if you can you hear me.

15:33.020 --> 15:36.020
And I know I wasn't there for you.

15:38.540 --> 15:41.540
But I'm here now. I promise.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.436
Yes, I knew him.

16:00.460 --> 16:01.956
We were tracers together.

16:01.980 --> 16:03.156
Tracers?

16:03.180 --> 16:04.796
After the credit boom,
back in the '80s,

16:04.820 --> 16:07.820
when people first started borrowing
money they couldn't afford.

16:09.660 --> 16:12.396
It's hard to believe there was
a time when people didn't do that.

16:12.420 --> 16:15.276
Yeah, right.

16:15.300 --> 16:18.156
The best liar I ever knew.

16:18.180 --> 16:21.076
Were you working with him
at the time of his murder?

16:21.100 --> 16:22.596
No. No?

16:22.620 --> 16:24.636
No, we'd gone our separate ways.

16:24.660 --> 16:27.076
You have a sense of what
he might have been working on?

16:27.100 --> 16:29.396
None.

16:29.420 --> 16:32.420
Can I ask you, who do you work for?

16:33.660 --> 16:36.596
Why? You want to hire me?

16:36.620 --> 16:39.076
Any newspapers use your services?

16:39.100 --> 16:40.756
Why would a newspaper need me

16:40.780 --> 16:43.780
when they've got educated
journalists like yourselves?

16:43.940 --> 16:45.996
Have the police spoken to you?

16:46.020 --> 16:47.756
No.

16:47.780 --> 16:49.676
That doesn't surprise you? No.

16:49.700 --> 16:52.700
Why wouldn't that surprise you?

16:52.900 --> 16:55.900
Just a robbery gone wrong.

17:07.020 --> 17:09.756
Good morning.
Hello. Please sit down.

17:09.780 --> 17:12.780
I'm very sorry about your son.

17:14.060 --> 17:15.276
Oh, thank you.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.996
He'll be back to work very soon.

17:18.020 --> 17:19.036
I'm sure.

17:19.060 --> 17:20.435
So you wanted to talk?

17:20.460 --> 17:21.876
Away from my advisors.

17:21.900 --> 17:24.900
My team prefer me
to stick to their prepared points.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.156
I prefer to speak from the heart.

17:27.180 --> 17:30.180
OK, so you made your fortune,
selling soccer shirts.

17:32.860 --> 17:34.276
Initially.

17:34.300 --> 17:37.300
Stitched in Bangladesh,
brought the business back here.

17:38.260 --> 17:40.876
Costs more,
but I figured we'd sell more too.

17:40.900 --> 17:42.436
You support the team.

17:42.460 --> 17:44.636
You support the team that made
the shirts too.

17:44.660 --> 17:46.156
You're loved by your community.

17:46.180 --> 17:48.076
Communities.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.756
My businesses are spread
across the country,

17:50.780 --> 17:53.780
in all the places
ignored by Westminster.

17:54.140 --> 17:56.796
Creating thousands of jobs.

17:56.820 --> 17:58.716
Over 7,000.

17:58.740 --> 18:01.740
Your employees speak
very fondly of you.

18:01.820 --> 18:03.236
Yes, I speak fondly of them.

18:03.260 --> 18:06.076
Your children are nice. Husband
seems nice. You've got a cute dog.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.236
He's nice too.

18:07.260 --> 18:10.260
Look, even you own your own
apple orchard.

18:11.620 --> 18:12.636
Early Windsor variety.

18:12.660 --> 18:15.356
Nice! You brew your own cider? Yes.

18:15.380 --> 18:18.380
Which I understand is really very,
very good?

18:19.100 --> 18:22.100
So tell me, why do you want to be the
most powerful person in the country?

18:25.020 --> 18:26.476
Do you really think
you can win this?

18:26.500 --> 18:29.500
Oh, I think it's required of me.
This is a nation in decline.

18:29.780 --> 18:31.556
The Prime Minister -

18:31.580 --> 18:34.476
he tells us the best we can do is to
manage our decline to slow it down.

18:34.500 --> 18:35.636
I refuse to accept that.

18:35.660 --> 18:38.660
Why can't we be
the greatest nation on Earth?

18:39.380 --> 18:42.380
It's going to take a lot more than
soccer shirts and cider to pull that off.

18:45.580 --> 18:47.516
So I know people laugh at me,
like I'm uncouth,

18:47.540 --> 18:50.236
like my campaign's a joke.

18:50.260 --> 18:52.716
My parents weren't rich.
They weren't educated.

18:52.740 --> 18:55.676
They didn't know anyone powerful.
Nothing was ever expected of them.

18:55.700 --> 18:58.700
But when I told them, when I told
them, that I wanted to run my own

18:58.940 --> 19:01.940
business and own my own factories and
be my own boss, they said go for it.

19:02.220 --> 19:04.236
They didn't look at me
like I was something small.

19:04.260 --> 19:07.260
They looked at me like I was
the biggest thing in their lives.

19:07.860 --> 19:10.860
That look has nourished me
every day of my life.

19:12.020 --> 19:14.076
I've never let anyone
tell me my place.

19:14.100 --> 19:16.116
And I won't be told this
country's place either.

19:16.140 --> 19:19.140
I will not be told that this country
is a second-rate power on the wane,

19:20.380 --> 19:23.380
like it's a fact and you're a fool
if you don't believe it.

19:24.220 --> 19:25.996
Cos I've proved those
people wrong before.

19:26.020 --> 19:29.020
I've proved those people
wrong 1,000 times.

19:29.620 --> 19:32.620
And I will do it again.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.716
Angela...

19:38.740 --> 19:40.716
...just talk to me now.

19:40.740 --> 19:43.740
You honestly think that you can
take this little island,

19:44.500 --> 19:47.036
which almost everyone believes
has had its day,

19:47.060 --> 19:50.060
and make it the most powerful
country on the planet?

19:52.020 --> 19:55.020
Yes, sir, I do.

20:25.900 --> 20:28.900
Emma!

20:31.340 --> 20:34.340
Hi, hon.

20:35.820 --> 20:38.820
Hi, darling.

21:08.980 --> 21:11.980
We are here to celebrate ten years of marriage
between Max and my daughter, Kathryn.

21:20.260 --> 21:23.260
I first met Max shortly after
he'd arrived in this country.

21:25.140 --> 21:27.756
The son of a factory owner,

21:27.780 --> 21:30.780
he'd made his decision making steel
wasn't for him.

21:34.180 --> 21:36.676
We now know him as a press baron.

21:36.700 --> 21:39.700
Back then, he was the owner
of two US tabloids.

21:53.460 --> 21:55.076
May I?

21:55.100 --> 21:58.100
Of course.

22:03.780 --> 22:05.916
How does it feel...

22:05.940 --> 22:08.940
...to be the future?

22:09.500 --> 22:11.476
I still have a long way to go.

22:11.500 --> 22:14.500
A few more front pages.

22:15.020 --> 22:18.020
I appreciate your husband's support.

22:19.180 --> 22:22.180
I have aspirations for this
country, which Max shares...

22:22.340 --> 22:25.340
Shares, yes.

22:26.260 --> 22:29.260
Perhaps you've danced with
too many politicians?

22:30.860 --> 22:33.860
Perhaps I have.

22:33.980 --> 22:36.980
You don't believe that the pursuit
of power - at times grubby -

22:37.860 --> 22:40.860
can be noble?

22:41.620 --> 22:44.620
I believe in you.

22:45.020 --> 22:48.020
I appreciate that.

22:49.500 --> 22:52.500
Kathryn, can I ask?

22:53.860 --> 22:55.996
Forget it.

22:56.020 --> 22:59.020
Ask me.

22:59.060 --> 23:02.060
Are you happy?

23:08.620 --> 23:11.620
That's why you're going to win.

23:18.300 --> 23:21.300
It would not be wrong, Max,
to say that I consider you a friend.

23:25.740 --> 23:28.740
That's very kind of you to say.
Thank you.

23:29.460 --> 23:32.460
Excuse me.

23:39.300 --> 23:42.300
Sh!

23:44.820 --> 23:47.820
Are you and Dad going
to stay together?

23:49.780 --> 23:52.780
Where did you hear that?

23:53.300 --> 23:56.300
Caden, tell me.

23:57.100 --> 23:59.916
Dad will fire her.

23:59.940 --> 24:02.940
Your father and I...

24:03.420 --> 24:06.356
...are having difficulties.

24:06.380 --> 24:08.276
Every couple has difficulties.

24:08.300 --> 24:09.716
We don't.

24:09.740 --> 24:12.740
We're not a couple.

24:12.820 --> 24:15.820
If you did separate from Dad,
I'd stay with you, wouldn't I?

24:18.060 --> 24:21.060
Your father and I
are not going to separate.

24:22.100 --> 24:25.100
Whatever happens,
I'll never leave you.

24:25.860 --> 24:27.196
You promise?

24:27.220 --> 24:30.220
I don't need to promise.
It could never happen.

24:34.820 --> 24:37.820
Mm.

24:39.020 --> 24:40.036
Thank you, Sean.

24:40.060 --> 24:43.060
You're very kind. Thank you, both.

24:47.180 --> 24:49.676
You can't keep running to him
every time he snaps his fingers.

24:49.700 --> 24:51.596
It was a few minutes -
I put him back to bed.

24:51.620 --> 24:54.620
You were supposed to be down there,
helping me out, saying goodnight to guests.

24:54.820 --> 24:57.820
What difference does it make? You are
spoiling him... I was reading him a story!

24:58.020 --> 25:00.436
...suffocating him!
You are worrying constantly!

25:00.460 --> 25:02.396
Can't you understand why?

25:02.420 --> 25:03.876
Of course I understand why!

25:03.900 --> 25:05.396
But is it for your benefit or his?

25:05.420 --> 25:07.436
Do you know what Caden said to me?

25:07.460 --> 25:09.996
What?

25:10.020 --> 25:13.020
He overheard a member of our staff
comment on our marriage.

25:15.220 --> 25:16.716
Who did he overhear?

25:16.740 --> 25:18.356
He won't tell me.

25:18.380 --> 25:21.380
Thinks you'd fire them.
I would fire them.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.116
Well, this is how
he sees his father.

25:23.140 --> 25:24.756
People lose their jobs.

25:24.780 --> 25:26.556
Do you want to shield him
from that fact too?

25:26.580 --> 25:28.196
No, just the fact
you enjoy doing it.

25:28.220 --> 25:31.220
I don't enjoy it!
I have never enj...

25:34.020 --> 25:35.116
You're tired.

25:35.140 --> 25:36.436
Don't talk to me like that.

25:36.460 --> 25:39.460
You're trying to pick a fight.

25:41.820 --> 25:44.820
Max, I want to work again!

25:45.220 --> 25:46.236
So work.

25:46.260 --> 25:49.260
I want to write again! So write.

25:49.340 --> 25:52.156
But I thought you were happy
when I stopped.

25:52.180 --> 25:53.516
I was glad.

25:53.540 --> 25:55.716
Not because you were my wife.

25:55.740 --> 25:58.740
I didn't like your writing.

26:00.940 --> 26:03.940
What? You think I stole this great
talent from the world?

26:04.700 --> 26:07.700
All those stories you covered -
famines, poverty.

26:08.140 --> 26:11.140
But you never asked, "What might
my readers be interested in?"

26:11.780 --> 26:14.476
I was respected.

26:14.500 --> 26:17.500
But not read.

26:21.460 --> 26:24.460
I'm sorry.

26:40.900 --> 26:43.900
My newspapers are not a last
resort for unfulfilled wives.

26:59.460 --> 27:02.460
In here.

27:05.500 --> 27:07.316
Please find me before you leave.

27:07.340 --> 27:09.396
I will. Thank you.

27:09.420 --> 27:12.420
You're welcome.

27:15.220 --> 27:18.220
The press have reported that
Caden was in a car accident.

27:18.620 --> 27:21.156
The news of a stroke raises
different questions.

27:21.180 --> 27:24.180
His blood alcohol concentration
was 4.1 milligrams.

27:24.220 --> 27:27.220
The legal limit is 0.8.

27:28.260 --> 27:31.260
The level of cocaine was 1.12
milligrams per litre of blood.

27:37.060 --> 27:40.060
Caden is an addict.

27:44.180 --> 27:47.180
Give us the room, please.

27:49.100 --> 27:52.100
Thank you.

27:55.540 --> 27:58.540
All right.

28:03.580 --> 28:06.580
All right.

28:20.340 --> 28:23.276
What is this?

28:23.300 --> 28:26.300
This is our son.

28:27.900 --> 28:30.156
Did you know? No.

28:30.180 --> 28:32.556
You didn't know?

28:32.580 --> 28:35.580
No, I would've told you.

28:37.580 --> 28:40.476
This...

28:40.500 --> 28:43.500
I'm confused.

28:48.300 --> 28:51.300
I kept asking him...

28:52.020 --> 28:55.020
...who are you dating?
Who do you love? Men? Women?

28:56.260 --> 28:58.676
I don't care. But find someone!

28:58.700 --> 29:01.700
Yes.

29:03.300 --> 29:06.300
He can't fall in love!

29:07.940 --> 29:10.940
My son can't fall in love!

29:11.820 --> 29:13.956
He was a loving child.

29:13.980 --> 29:16.980
He was handsome, intelligent, kind.

29:17.500 --> 29:19.636
He had choices.

29:19.660 --> 29:21.916
He was unwell.

29:21.940 --> 29:23.356
What was going on in his work?

29:23.380 --> 29:25.876
Sorry, why does it have
to be about his work?

29:25.900 --> 29:28.076
Because we know everything
else that happened to him.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.100
We know who he slept with,
what he drank.

29:31.700 --> 29:34.700
Who was he trying to be?

29:35.540 --> 29:38.540
Cos this isn't our son.

29:47.260 --> 29:50.260
You know when, I first heard
the news about my son, I had...

29:53.260 --> 29:55.036
...so many thoughts
coming into my head -

29:55.060 --> 29:58.060
how much I loved him,
how much I wanted him to be OK.

30:02.020 --> 30:05.020
There was one other thought
that occurred to me.

30:06.060 --> 30:09.060
A terrible thought.

30:09.420 --> 30:10.556
Nonetheless, there it was.

30:10.581 --> 30:14.071
Round and round and
round in my head...

30:17.620 --> 30:20.620
...at least he can't fuck up
anything else up now.

30:26.060 --> 30:29.060
Even that might not be true.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.036
Caden, it's not funny!

31:18.060 --> 31:21.060
Caden!

31:21.660 --> 31:24.660
Caden!

31:31.180 --> 31:33.556
Caden!

31:33.580 --> 31:36.580
Don't tell me
what you think I want to hear.

31:37.260 --> 31:38.956
Will you break up?

31:38.980 --> 31:41.980
I'll never leave you.

32:07.820 --> 32:10.820
Lauren would like to speak to you.

32:18.900 --> 32:21.900
Thank you. Goodbye.

32:24.260 --> 32:26.676
It's a pleasure to finally meet you.

32:26.700 --> 32:29.036
I've been admiring
your writing for years.

32:29.060 --> 32:30.436
Thank you.

32:30.460 --> 32:33.460
Take a seat.

32:33.580 --> 32:36.580
Would you like a coffee? Great.

32:41.500 --> 32:43.036
Have you met Max yet?

32:43.060 --> 32:44.956
Er, no.

32:44.980 --> 32:46.636
Well, you must.

32:46.660 --> 32:48.196
He's in town.

32:48.220 --> 32:50.196
Preoccupied right now
with his family.

32:50.220 --> 32:53.076
Yes. I heard.

32:53.100 --> 32:55.516
Would you like some cake?

32:55.540 --> 32:58.540
Sure.

33:00.540 --> 33:03.476
For Max, this newspaper was
never about chasing circulation.

33:03.500 --> 33:06.500
It was about shaping
the national conversation

33:06.700 --> 33:08.716
and, to do that, we need
talent like yours.

33:08.740 --> 33:10.236
I appreciate that. And Maggie's,

33:10.260 --> 33:12.796
which is why I was so upset
when she left.

33:12.820 --> 33:15.820
Yeah, it was a loss.

33:15.900 --> 33:17.316
Are you close to her?

33:17.340 --> 33:18.516
I wasn't the closest, no.

33:18.540 --> 33:21.540
But you've stayed in touch?

33:22.460 --> 33:25.460
Yeah.

33:25.740 --> 33:28.036
My mum brought me up alone.

33:28.060 --> 33:29.876
She was a cleaner.

33:29.900 --> 33:32.900
When I was a teenager, I asked if I could
help out because I needed some money.

33:33.420 --> 33:36.420
She told the people she worked
for that I baked the best cakes.

33:36.980 --> 33:39.796
I don't know if they were the best,
but they were pretty good.

33:39.820 --> 33:42.820
Soon, I was selling cakes to
a bunch of different families.

33:43.660 --> 33:46.660
I must have become big-headed,
going on about how great I was,

33:47.740 --> 33:50.740
because one day my mum
explained that,

33:50.820 --> 33:53.820
if she ever stopped cleaning their
houses, they'd stop buying my cakes.

33:56.940 --> 33:59.940
She explained that
I wasn't actually selling cakes -

33:59.980 --> 34:02.356
I was selling charity
for the cleaner's daughter.

34:02.380 --> 34:05.380
My cakes made my mum's customers feel like they
were better people - generous and warm-hearted.

34:06.460 --> 34:09.460
But if she'd asked for even
the smallest raise,

34:09.580 --> 34:12.580
they would've refused.

34:13.540 --> 34:16.540
Do you know what
I learnt from that experience?

34:17.980 --> 34:20.980
How to get what you
want from people.

34:21.380 --> 34:22.596
Sometimes, you ask directly.

34:22.620 --> 34:25.620
They say no. You bake them a cake.

34:33.179 --> 34:36.179
Kathryn? Scott.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.996
Oh, that's very kind.

34:40.020 --> 34:42.556
I would've called,
but I don't have your number.

34:42.580 --> 34:45.436
I'm really sorry, I can't talk
right now - I've got to go.

34:45.460 --> 34:46.755
I'll... Another day?

34:46.780 --> 34:49.780
Sure. I'll call you. Great.

34:51.420 --> 34:52.556
Scott...

34:52.580 --> 34:55.196
...you can't come here.

34:55.219 --> 34:58.196
I didn't know how else to get
in touch. I'll ring you.

34:58.220 --> 34:59.316
OK.

34:59.340 --> 35:02.340
I'm happy to see you.

35:03.700 --> 35:06.700
I'm really sorry.

35:48.500 --> 35:49.796
Is this necessary?

35:49.820 --> 35:51.636
He became very distressed.

35:51.660 --> 35:54.660
Caden was trying to
rip out his tubes.

35:55.260 --> 35:56.876
I'm going to remove them.

35:56.900 --> 35:58.996
I'd advise against that.

35:59.020 --> 36:02.020
I'll take responsibility.

36:19.140 --> 36:22.140
Mum...

36:23.140 --> 36:26.140
Mum...

36:32.580 --> 36:35.580
Mum...

36:54.180 --> 36:57.180
It'll come back.

36:59.460 --> 37:01.596
It'll all come back.

37:01.620 --> 37:04.620
Father...

37:06.420 --> 37:08.476
Father...

37:08.500 --> 37:11.500
He's on his way.

37:28.860 --> 37:30.876
I'm going to take the stairs.

37:30.900 --> 37:33.900
On my own. Thank you.

37:51.100 --> 37:53.076
Hi. Hey.

37:53.100 --> 37:54.476
He's awake. He's awake!

37:54.500 --> 37:55.636
How's he doing?

37:55.660 --> 37:57.876
He's been talking.

37:57.900 --> 38:00.900
But we don't know how
much he understands.

38:01.220 --> 38:03.636
Welcome back.

38:03.660 --> 38:06.660
Yeah, he's much better.

38:07.380 --> 38:10.380
All right.

38:30.060 --> 38:33.060
What?

38:37.420 --> 38:40.420
What do you... What does he want?

38:42.460 --> 38:45.460
Do you get it?

38:46.940 --> 38:49.036
Mirror?

38:49.060 --> 38:50.436
Mirror?

38:50.460 --> 38:53.460
Mirror?

39:19.060 --> 39:21.676
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

39:21.700 --> 39:23.876
No. Caden, no.

39:23.900 --> 39:25.596
Don't do it.

39:25.620 --> 39:27.316
No, no.

39:27.340 --> 39:29.756
Put it down.

39:29.780 --> 39:32.196
Put your arm down. Caden,
put your arm down!

39:32.220 --> 39:33.476
Please, put it down.

39:33.500 --> 39:35.676
You don't need to do this.
Now look at me.

39:35.700 --> 39:38.700
Look. Look at me!

39:39.300 --> 39:42.300
Look at me.

39:44.860 --> 39:47.860
We're going to make you better.

39:49.340 --> 39:52.340
OK?

39:57.300 --> 39:58.836
How's Caden?

39:58.860 --> 40:01.116
He's awake.

40:01.140 --> 40:03.756
He's conscious, confused.

40:03.780 --> 40:06.676
Kathryn?

40:06.700 --> 40:07.796
She's strong.

40:07.820 --> 40:09.796
Always strong.

40:09.820 --> 40:12.276
My son went through
a difficult time.

40:12.300 --> 40:15.300
Not like this, but challenging.

40:16.740 --> 40:19.740
When you're in the middle of it,
it seems as if there's no end.

40:21.700 --> 40:24.700
But you get through.

40:26.140 --> 40:28.196
Thank you.

40:28.220 --> 40:31.076
I called you here as a friend.

40:31.100 --> 40:33.396
I came as one.

40:33.420 --> 40:35.916
And to apologise.

40:35.940 --> 40:38.940
For what?

40:40.420 --> 40:43.420
Our last meeting.

40:44.380 --> 40:47.380
I've never taken
your support for granted.

40:48.820 --> 40:51.820
Well, why would it
seem that you have?

40:52.900 --> 40:55.900
The circumstances.

40:56.420 --> 40:59.420
I hear Angela Howard
has been to see you.

40:59.620 --> 41:02.620
Yes, I know she's an accomplished...

41:02.700 --> 41:04.276
...businesswoman, for sure. She is.

41:04.300 --> 41:07.300
But there's something off about her.

41:08.020 --> 41:09.916
Not just the prepared statements.

41:09.940 --> 41:12.556
The unscripted comments.

41:12.580 --> 41:15.476
You catch a glimpse of it out
of the corner of your eye.

41:15.500 --> 41:18.500
The flash of an idea,
a world view, not just odd...

41:22.700 --> 41:24.676
...disturbing.

41:24.700 --> 41:27.276
She fights from the fringe.

41:27.300 --> 41:30.300
She doesn't want to be accepted by the
establishment. She wants to rip it down.

41:35.020 --> 41:38.020
She's dangerous.

41:39.100 --> 41:42.100
Dangerous to you.

41:50.980 --> 41:53.980
I'm outside.

42:10.420 --> 42:13.420
What do we know
about the Prime Minister's son?

42:16.140 --> 42:19.140
"The trees seemed to whisper to
each other, scaring Snow White,"

42:19.900 --> 42:22.900
"who began to run."

42:35.140 --> 42:38.140
Night-night, sweetheart.

43:10.780 --> 43:13.236
Phone?

43:13.260 --> 43:16.260
No-one ever phones you.

43:44.220 --> 43:47.220
I know you don't drink.
So I thought - music.

43:48.260 --> 43:50.756
They serve food here.

43:50.780 --> 43:52.156
Good choice.

43:52.180 --> 43:55.180
Shall we go somewhere else?

43:55.260 --> 43:58.260
Why? I don't know.

43:59.180 --> 44:00.996
I can have a soft drink.

44:01.020 --> 44:03.956
OK.

44:03.980 --> 44:06.980
The hard thing is not being
able to buy you one.

44:07.580 --> 44:08.716
Doesn't matter.

44:08.740 --> 44:11.740
Not to you.

44:12.020 --> 44:14.796
Money was such a big
part of my life.

44:14.820 --> 44:17.820
More than alcohol...

44:19.700 --> 44:21.716
Sorry.

44:21.740 --> 44:24.740
Why did you ring?

44:24.980 --> 44:27.980
Just needed something
that wasn't sad.

44:29.900 --> 44:32.900
Fuck!

44:41.860 --> 44:43.876
♪ Faith can never hold you

44:43.900 --> 44:46.900
♪ Yours will be a faithful love... ♪

44:49.420 --> 44:52.396
There's a nurse caring for my son.

44:52.420 --> 44:55.420
I have the biggest crush on her.

44:57.260 --> 45:00.260
How exciting.

45:01.540 --> 45:04.540
In that hospital, your emotions -
everything's so intense.

45:11.300 --> 45:14.076
She's so wonderful.

45:14.100 --> 45:17.100
And I'm so overwhelmingly grateful.

45:18.660 --> 45:21.660
She's like...

45:23.460 --> 45:26.460
...pure human goodness.

45:32.460 --> 45:33.756
And you really want to kiss her?

45:33.780 --> 45:36.780
It's so wildly inappropriate.

45:40.660 --> 45:43.660
My son's lying there,
in a terrible condition.

45:44.620 --> 45:47.620
And I'm thinking about
kissing a pretty nurse.

47:19.060 --> 47:22.060
Morning.

47:23.260 --> 47:24.916
Morning!

47:24.940 --> 47:27.940
Oh, let me sleep! Oh, it's you!

47:30.500 --> 47:33.500
Don't worry, darling.
Leave it to me.

47:35.100 --> 47:36.676
Hello!

47:36.700 --> 47:39.700
And you are much more sober than
when I saw you at Lords!

47:41.540 --> 47:44.540
Here he is! Pleased to meet
you. Welcome to England.

47:47.140 --> 47:50.140
Good luck.

47:52.500 --> 47:54.956
The National Reporter
isn't a newspaper.

47:54.980 --> 47:56.996
It's an institution.

47:57.020 --> 48:00.020
A pillar of our democracy.

48:00.100 --> 48:03.100
At 200 years old, it's the record
keeper of our nation's events.

48:04.700 --> 48:06.836
It holds power to account

48:06.860 --> 48:09.236
and pursues the truth.

48:09.260 --> 48:12.260
And today, it stands on the
brink of financial ruin.

49:31.220 --> 49:34.220
My dad made steel
in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

49:35.780 --> 49:37.996
He owned four factories that were

49:38.020 --> 49:41.020
so big you needed a car to
get from one side to the other.

49:43.740 --> 49:46.740
I grew up in those factories.

49:47.020 --> 49:50.020
They were my home,
they were my back yard, my school.

49:55.540 --> 49:57.196
I ate lunch with the men
who worked there.

49:57.220 --> 49:58.596
I didn't go to college.

49:58.620 --> 50:00.916
My dad thought it made people soft.

50:00.940 --> 50:03.940
So, truthfully, there's nothing in
my upbringing that would make me

50:06.140 --> 50:09.140
a suitable proprietor for
this esteemed institution.

50:10.900 --> 50:13.900
But if you want this paper,
two centuries old...

50:15.460 --> 50:18.460
...to make into the next century,
you don't need someone like you.

50:18.540 --> 50:20.116
You need someone like me.

50:20.140 --> 50:23.140
You want a journalist to spend six
weeks on a single investigation?

50:26.300 --> 50:27.476
That costs money.

50:27.500 --> 50:30.500
You want five correspondents
assigned to Westminster?

50:31.260 --> 50:32.276
That costs money.

50:32.300 --> 50:35.300
Now, money is not
the enemy of quality.

50:37.780 --> 50:40.476
Money IS quality.

50:40.500 --> 50:42.716
I can...
I can read your mind a little bit.

50:42.740 --> 50:45.116
It's, like, who is this guy?
Who is he to know about quality?

50:45.140 --> 50:47.996
His dad makes steel!
He has tabloids!

50:48.020 --> 50:49.036
I do.

50:49.060 --> 50:51.676
Of course I do. I've got two here.
I've got two in the US.

50:51.700 --> 50:54.700
We run stories that most of you
probably will look down upon.

50:55.500 --> 50:58.500
But these papers are bought
by millions of hard-working people.

51:01.060 --> 51:03.516
And most of them are not rich.
I don't know how they do it.

51:03.540 --> 51:04.876
But some of them get...

51:04.900 --> 51:07.276
They still find the money to
buy my papers every day.

51:07.300 --> 51:10.300
Every day!

51:11.180 --> 51:14.180
Now, THAT'S the money
that might save your paper.

51:15.460 --> 51:18.076
Now, you prefer old money? Fine.

51:18.100 --> 51:20.196
I don't see 'em.

51:20.220 --> 51:21.676
They're not here.

51:21.700 --> 51:23.836
Old money is not interested.

51:23.860 --> 51:26.860
Old money is not going
to make this deal!

51:28.700 --> 51:31.276
My father wouldn't even
make this deal!

51:31.300 --> 51:32.676
I mean that.

51:32.700 --> 51:35.700
All you have is me.

51:38.860 --> 51:41.860
You're worried, aren't you? You're
worried that I'm going to interfere?

51:42.020 --> 51:43.516
Are you worried about that?

51:43.540 --> 51:44.996
Take my word, please.

51:45.020 --> 51:46.036
I will give you my word.

51:46.060 --> 51:48.156
I will give written
assurances to the government

51:48.180 --> 51:50.316
I will not interfere.

51:50.340 --> 51:52.636
I already have tabloids.
I don't want any more.

51:52.660 --> 51:54.756
I want quality.

51:54.780 --> 51:57.396
And I don't have two
centuries to build it.

51:57.420 --> 52:00.420
So I need to buy it.

52:07.340 --> 52:10.316
I will tell you this...

52:10.340 --> 52:13.340
...everything...
everything I buy I protect.

52:26.940 --> 52:29.940
Gentlemen, you don't
need to like me.

52:36.500 --> 52:39.500
But you do need me.

53:00.460 --> 53:03.460
I have to go.

53:04.100 --> 53:05.716
Where?

53:05.740 --> 53:07.276
To the hospital.

53:07.300 --> 53:10.236
But you can stay.

53:10.260 --> 53:11.556
Has something happened?

53:11.580 --> 53:14.076
Sorry? No.

53:14.100 --> 53:17.100
Should I leave? No. You stay.

53:17.780 --> 53:20.780
I've just got this feeling.

53:22.300 --> 53:25.300
It has nothing to do with you.

53:25.940 --> 53:26.956
Stay here alone?

53:26.980 --> 53:29.196
Sure.

53:29.220 --> 53:32.220
It's not about you.

53:43.660 --> 53:46.660
Scott?

54:06.540 --> 54:08.956
They know about us.

54:08.980 --> 54:11.980
That was quick.

54:14.100 --> 54:17.100
Do you want help?

54:24.580 --> 54:27.580
Is it worth it? This story?

54:28.860 --> 54:31.860
I need to know if this is worth it.

54:32.260 --> 54:35.156
I can't answer that.

54:35.180 --> 54:38.180
I'm sorry.

54:42.500 --> 54:45.500
Well, at least we now know who that
private detective is working for.

54:48.580 --> 54:51.580
Hm?

55:02.500 --> 55:05.076
I...

55:05.100 --> 55:07.636
You?

55:07.660 --> 55:10.476
...know...

55:10.500 --> 55:12.196
What do you know?

55:12.220 --> 55:13.916
...who...

55:13.940 --> 55:15.076
Who?

55:15.100 --> 55:16.436
...you...

55:16.460 --> 55:18.636
Who I?

55:18.660 --> 55:21.596
...fucked.

55:21.620 --> 55:23.916
How would you know
a thing like that?

55:23.940 --> 55:25.876
I...

55:25.900 --> 55:27.076
You?

55:27.100 --> 55:28.836
...did...

55:28.860 --> 55:30.876
Did? ..your...

55:30.900 --> 55:33.796
My? ..phone.

55:33.820 --> 55:35.436
You did my phone?

55:35.460 --> 55:38.460
I did your phone.

55:40.740 --> 55:43.740
You want me to call someone?

55:44.340 --> 55:47.036
Your mother?

55:47.060 --> 55:49.036
Mother...

55:49.060 --> 55:51.596
...don't know.

55:51.620 --> 55:54.476
You mother doesn't know what?

55:54.500 --> 55:57.500
Father knows.

55:57.700 --> 56:00.700
Your father - what does he know?
I did your phone!

56:02.700 --> 56:04.796
OK, OK. Look,
I'm here to help you, Caden.

56:04.820 --> 56:07.716
I did your phone!

56:07.740 --> 56:10.436
Calm down, Caden! I'm just
trying to help you here, OK?

56:10.460 --> 56:13.460
I did your phone!

56:25.300 --> 56:26.636
Caden?

56:26.660 --> 56:28.356
Caden!

56:28.380 --> 56:31.380
Caden, what's wrong?
Caden, what is it? Are you in pain?

56:33.220 --> 56:34.476
Caden!

56:34.500 --> 56:37.500
Caden, I'm here. I'm here.

56:38.660 --> 56:41.660
Caden, talk to me.

56:54.900 --> 56:57.900
Die...

57:00.100 --> 57:03.100
I want to die.

57:12.820 --> 57:15.516
Please!

57:15.540 --> 57:16.956
Please!

57:16.980 --> 57:19.980
No, Caden.

57:22.060 --> 57:25.060
Caden!

57:34.980 --> 57:37.980
You've been fucked.

57:45.300 --> 57:48.300
Yes.

57:52.340 --> 57:55.340
That's enough.

57:57.100 --> 57:59.956
Caden!

57:59.980 --> 58:02.980
Please!

58:04.020 --> 58:07.020
Nurse!

58:09.300 --> 58:11.596
Help!

58:11.620 --> 58:14.620
Help! Help! Help!

58:15.460 --> 58:18.460
Will you get someone? Get
someone now! Get someone!

58:20.620 --> 58:23.620
Caden! Caden!

58:26.580 --> 58:29.580
Caden!
