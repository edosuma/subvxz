00:36.875 --> 00:38.875
[distant animal calls]

00:43.041 --> 00:45.041
[eerie music playing]

00:50.708 --> 00:52.708
[faint creaking]

01:37.416 --> 01:39.625
[bugle fanfare playing]

01:58.083 --> 01:59.625
Morning, gentlemen.

01:59.708 --> 02:01.250
[horses whinnying]

02:02.250 --> 02:04.333
- You Augustus Landor?
- I am.

02:05.125 --> 02:06.250
And you?

02:06.333 --> 02:09.375
Captain Hitchcock at your service.
Second-in-command at the Academy.

02:10.333 --> 02:11.833
I'm here to inform you

02:11.916 --> 02:14.791
Superintendent Thayer
requests an immediate audience.

02:14.875 --> 02:17.916
- And the nature of this audience?
- I'll leave that to the colonel.

02:18.708 --> 02:21.791
- When might this take place?
- At your earliest convenience.

02:21.875 --> 02:23.875
[chuckles]

02:25.708 --> 02:28.416
And if I should decide not to come?

02:31.458 --> 02:34.291
That would be your own concern.
You're a private citizen.

02:39.125 --> 02:39.958
[exhales deeply]

02:42.250 --> 02:44.208
Well, it's a fine day for a ride.

02:45.416 --> 02:48.500
[intriguing music playing]

02:53.250 --> 02:55.625
[Thayer] <i>The governor suggests</i>
<i>that you were a legend</i>

02:55.708 --> 02:57.458
<i>among New York City constables.</i>

02:59.333 --> 03:03.291
<i>And when he recommended your services,</i>
<i>he noted your impressive accomplishments,</i>

03:03.375 --> 03:06.666
<i>including apprehending</i>
<i>the leaders of the Daybreak Boys,</i>

03:06.750 --> 03:08.958
<i>breaking up the dreaded Shirt Tails gang,</i>

03:09.041 --> 03:14.208
<i>and solving a particularly grisly murder</i>
<i>of a young prostitute in Elysian Fields.</i>

03:16.958 --> 03:20.250
<i>Your talents include</i>
<i>code breaking, riot control,</i>

03:20.333 --> 03:22.416
<i>and gloveless interrogation.</i>

03:23.166 --> 03:25.000
<i>You're a minister's son from Gloucester</i>

03:25.083 --> 03:27.416
<i>who came to New York</i>
<i>while still in your teens.</i>

03:28.333 --> 03:32.375
<i>And you are a widower, Mr. Landor.</i>

03:32.458 --> 03:33.833
<i>Three years now.</i>

03:35.916 --> 03:39.125
- [Hitchcock] Shall I send for coffee?
- [Landor] Beer will do nicely.

03:40.041 --> 03:41.916
[bell tolling]

03:45.875 --> 03:46.708
[exhales]

03:46.791 --> 03:48.166
You, uh…

03:49.166 --> 03:54.666
You keep these notes in a pigeonhole
back there somewhere, do you?

03:54.750 --> 03:55.666
What else do they say?

03:55.750 --> 03:58.958
Do they say that I haven't
darkened the door of a church

04:00.625 --> 04:01.625
in a long time?

04:03.083 --> 04:07.000
Does it mention
that my daughter ran off a while back?

04:08.125 --> 04:11.916
We are aware
of your daughter's disappearance.

04:12.791 --> 04:14.416
And we offer our sympathy.

04:16.041 --> 04:18.500
With all due respect,
I hope I have not offended.

04:18.583 --> 04:21.166
No. No, no, no.

04:21.875 --> 04:24.583
No, sorry. I ought to apologize.

04:24.666 --> 04:27.375
And I do. Please carry on.

04:28.250 --> 04:33.083
Mr. Landor, we are obliged
to proceed with extreme discretion.

04:33.166 --> 04:34.708
We're looking for someone.

04:34.791 --> 04:38.375
A private citizen
of well-documented industry and tact

04:38.458 --> 04:41.958
who might carry out inquiries
on the Academy's behalf.

04:43.291 --> 04:44.125
Huh.

04:44.208 --> 04:46.625
They're of a highly complex
and delicate nature

04:46.708 --> 04:49.333
and concern one of our cadets.

04:50.250 --> 04:53.458
Second-year man
from Kentucky by the name of Fry.

04:54.250 --> 04:56.916
- Leroy Fry.
- There's no point in dancing around it.

04:58.041 --> 05:01.041
Fry hanged himself… last night.

05:03.166 --> 05:04.000
Oh.

05:04.916 --> 05:06.541
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

05:07.291 --> 05:12.458
A dreadful business, this.
But you must understand our position.

05:12.541 --> 05:16.541
We have been specifically charged
with the care of these young men,

05:16.625 --> 05:20.708
to make them gentlemen and soldiers,
and to that end, we drive them.

05:21.875 --> 05:26.000
But we'd like to think
we know when to… stop driving them.

05:27.291 --> 05:28.750
A boy hangs himself…

05:30.166 --> 05:31.666
uh, that's a matter for the coroner.

05:31.750 --> 05:33.750
[Hitchcock] I'm afraid
that's not the end of it.

05:35.166 --> 05:41.500
Cadet Fry's body was
violated last night in the hospital ward.

05:42.916 --> 05:45.541
Violated? By whom?

05:45.625 --> 05:48.958
Well, if we knew that, we would
have had no need to summon you.

05:49.041 --> 05:51.833
I'm sure the Academy
has its share of pranksters.

05:51.916 --> 05:54.500
This was no prank, Mr. Landor.

05:56.375 --> 06:00.125
Leroy Fry's heart
was carved from his chest.

06:01.541 --> 06:03.541
[somber music playing]

06:04.208 --> 06:07.291
[Landor] Dr. Marquis, how does
a person go about doing this?

06:08.541 --> 06:13.708
[Dr. Marquis] Scalpel. Or any good,
sharp knife would do.

06:14.541 --> 06:18.458
But getting to the heart,
that's the tricky part.

06:20.125 --> 06:24.416
Those gashes on the lungs and liver

06:24.500 --> 06:27.625
came from angling
the blade to save the heart.

06:28.791 --> 06:31.541
And how would one preserve the heart?

06:32.500 --> 06:34.375
A container of some sort.

06:35.166 --> 06:38.541
Wrapped in muslin, maybe, or newspaper.

06:39.541 --> 06:41.666
Very likely surrounded by ice.

06:43.208 --> 06:44.916
What type of fella could do this?

06:46.458 --> 06:47.708
A strong one.

06:48.291 --> 06:49.500
Not a woman, then?

06:49.583 --> 06:53.083
No woman as I've ever had
the pleasure of meeting, no.

06:53.166 --> 06:55.708
[Landor] What about his medical pedigree?

06:55.791 --> 07:00.708
Would he need to be as well-educated
and well-trained as yourself?

07:02.250 --> 07:03.416
Not necessarily.

07:04.583 --> 07:07.083
He'd need a lot of light,
and know where to cut,

07:07.166 --> 07:11.500
but it wouldn't have to be
a doctor or a surgeon.

07:11.583 --> 07:13.166
- It'd have to be--
- A madman!

07:14.541 --> 07:15.833
And still out there.

07:18.041 --> 07:20.000
[drill sergeant] Port arms!

07:20.083 --> 07:22.541
[Thayer] You'll have to forgive me,
Mr. Landor.

07:22.625 --> 07:24.791
You've found us
in a very delicate position.

07:24.875 --> 07:26.083
[drill sergeant] Left, face!

07:26.166 --> 07:28.500
There are certain
powerful senators in Washington

07:28.583 --> 07:32.375
who would like nothing more than
to see us fail utterly, to shut us down.

07:34.458 --> 07:40.541
I'm asking you to help save the honor
of the United States Military Academy.

07:41.625 --> 07:43.041
And save it, I'll try.

07:44.625 --> 07:46.541
[pensive music playing]

07:47.125 --> 07:51.333
[Landor] You were, uh, on guard duty
last night, Mr. Huntoon.

07:51.416 --> 07:52.458
Yes, sir.

07:53.083 --> 07:56.375
Post at 9:30. Relieved at midnight
and made my way back to the guardroom.

07:56.458 --> 07:57.625
Where is that?

07:58.208 --> 08:00.333
Number four, sir. By Fort Clinton.

08:00.416 --> 08:03.125
I… I admit, I'm not very familiar
with the grounds,

08:03.208 --> 08:05.916
but it seems that the part
we're standing on right now

08:06.000 --> 08:10.583
is not on the way
from Fort Clinton to North Barracks.

08:10.666 --> 08:12.708
- No, sir.
- Oh. What took you off course?

08:12.791 --> 08:15.500
Well, sir, on my way, I heard something.

08:16.333 --> 08:17.875
I reckoned it was an animal.

08:17.958 --> 08:21.375
It sounded like it was dying
or caught in a trap, so I came to help.

08:21.458 --> 08:23.541
I'm terribly partial to animals.

08:24.958 --> 08:29.416
Uh… I was running this way
until I brushed Cadet Fry, sir.

08:29.500 --> 08:31.833
- How'd he look?
- Not well, sir.

08:32.875 --> 08:34.250
He wasn't hanging straight.

08:35.291 --> 08:37.916
It was almost
as if he was seated in a chair.

08:39.125 --> 08:40.666
I'm not following you.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.458
Well, his feet were
touching the ground, sir.

08:45.083 --> 08:47.875
- His feet were touching the ground?
- Yes, sir.

08:50.333 --> 08:53.625
All right. What did you do next?

08:54.333 --> 08:57.541
I ran. Ran straight back
to North Barracks.

08:58.583 --> 08:59.416
Hmm.

09:00.541 --> 09:03.875
Uh, one last question
and I'll trouble you no more.

09:04.541 --> 09:06.333
Did you see anyone else about?

09:07.208 --> 09:08.041
No, sir.

09:11.125 --> 09:12.125
Mr. Huntoon.

09:15.833 --> 09:17.833
[pensive music continues]

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
[Landor] <i>The neck…</i>

09:20.750 --> 09:23.583
That's what first struck me.

09:24.375 --> 09:25.208
See?

09:26.041 --> 09:29.000
Not a clean cinch at all.
The rope grabbed at him

09:29.083 --> 09:33.083
and ran up and down the neck
looking for purchase.

09:33.166 --> 09:34.583
As though…

09:34.666 --> 09:37.416
As though he was… fighting.

09:38.125 --> 09:38.958
Hmm?

09:40.791 --> 09:42.583
Look, if you would, at his fingers.

09:42.666 --> 09:45.458
Blistered fresh
from clutching at the rope…

09:45.541 --> 09:46.833
[door opens]

09:46.916 --> 09:50.125
- …trying to peel the thing off him.
- [door closes]

09:50.208 --> 09:52.416
May I ask what's going on here?

09:53.458 --> 09:55.875
This is, uh, quite irregular.

09:57.125 --> 10:01.500
I was wondering if you wouldn't mind
feeling around the back of Mr. Fry's head.

10:01.583 --> 10:03.833
You did examine Mr. Fry?

10:03.916 --> 10:06.916
Of course I examined him, as is my job.

10:07.000 --> 10:07.833
[Landor] Hmm.

10:11.541 --> 10:14.125
[Dr. Marquis softly] Haven't we already
been through this?

10:25.833 --> 10:27.375
- Uh…
- Hmm.

10:28.750 --> 10:32.250
There is a contusion of sort.

10:33.291 --> 10:34.625
Parietal region.

10:35.375 --> 10:37.875
Approximately three inches.

10:41.291 --> 10:42.375
[breathes deeply]

10:43.291 --> 10:44.791
- I must have missed that.
- Mmm.

10:46.416 --> 10:48.791
[Hitchcock] Someone murdered Mr. Fry.

10:49.583 --> 10:52.000
Is this what
you're telling us, Mr. Landor?

10:52.083 --> 10:55.166
You might be onto something there,
Captain Hitchcock.

11:07.583 --> 11:08.416
[bones crack]

11:11.708 --> 11:13.125
[cracking]

11:28.000 --> 11:30.166
Well, anyone
could have missed that, doctor.

11:35.583 --> 11:36.666
Mr. Landor.

11:36.750 --> 11:38.416
[soldiers marching nearby]

11:39.000 --> 11:40.000
[door closes]

11:40.083 --> 11:41.500
So now you're on board,

11:42.416 --> 11:45.083
I think it's important
we set some ground rules.

11:46.708 --> 11:49.750
You will report to me
on a daily basis and I to the colonel.

11:50.333 --> 11:54.666
And you mustn't breathe a word of this
to anyone, inside or outside the Academy.

11:56.166 --> 11:58.666
- Is that all?
- One final condition.

12:00.375 --> 12:03.875
There will be no drinking throughout
the course of this investigation.

12:06.291 --> 12:08.250
Your reputation precedes you.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.041
[distant animal calls]

12:29.000 --> 12:30.833
- [Landor sighs]
- [footsteps approaching]

12:32.833 --> 12:33.875
[Landor grunts]

12:33.958 --> 12:34.958
Oh.

12:35.041 --> 12:35.875
Pardon.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.416
- Are you Augustus Landor?
- [coughs] I am.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.500
Unless I mistake, you've been
tasked with solving the mystery

12:42.583 --> 12:44.125
surrounding Leroy Fry.

12:44.208 --> 12:46.416
That's so. What might I do for you?

12:46.500 --> 12:50.250
It is incumbent upon me
and the honor of this institution

12:50.333 --> 12:53.583
to divulge some of the conclusions
which I have reached.

12:53.666 --> 12:54.625
Conclusions?

12:54.708 --> 12:57.000
Regarding the late Mr. Fry.

12:58.000 --> 12:59.625
I'd be most interested.

13:00.791 --> 13:02.333
The man you're looking for

13:04.250 --> 13:05.250
is a poet.

13:12.958 --> 13:14.375
[marching band playing]

13:15.291 --> 13:16.583
[Landor] Private Cochrane.

13:17.208 --> 13:20.666
When Leroy Fry's body
was brought back to the hospital,

13:20.750 --> 13:23.333
you were detailed to guard it?

13:23.416 --> 13:24.625
I was, sir.

13:25.250 --> 13:29.291
- Did anything happen while on watch?
- Not till around 2:30.

13:29.875 --> 13:32.708
- That's when I was relieved of my duty.
- Who relieved you?

13:34.541 --> 13:38.333
- Private, who relieved you?
- I can't tell you, sir.

13:39.416 --> 13:40.916
Only that it was an officer.

13:42.208 --> 13:44.541
- He never identified himself?
- No, sir.

13:45.208 --> 13:47.291
But I wouldn't expect it of an officer.

13:48.375 --> 13:49.583
Hmm.

13:49.666 --> 13:51.333
What did this officer say to you?

13:51.958 --> 13:56.541
He said, "Thank you, private.
That will be all. I'm relieving you."

13:56.625 --> 14:00.291
- An odd request, no?
- Yes, sir. Very.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.666
- Did you see this officer's face?
- No, sir.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.875
I had only a candle. It was terribly dark.

14:07.958 --> 14:10.750
Right, tell me then,
how did you know it was an officer?

14:10.833 --> 14:15.416
The bar on his shoulder, sir.
But I must admit, it was so very strange.

14:15.500 --> 14:17.375
- How so?
- The bars.

14:18.166 --> 14:20.625
The bars on his left shoulder
were missing.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.250
[intriguing music playing]

14:30.500 --> 14:32.500
[violin playing softly]

14:34.666 --> 14:35.666
[door opens]

14:37.541 --> 14:38.750
[door closes]

14:38.833 --> 14:40.916
[Benny] Ah, there's the man himself.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.958
Benny knows a man
who's in need of a drink when he sees one.

14:45.041 --> 14:49.125
The very sight of it warms my blood.

14:49.916 --> 14:51.375
- Benny!
- Sir.

14:51.458 --> 14:54.708
- Here's… to rules.
- Fuck 'em.

15:01.625 --> 15:02.625
Patsy.

15:03.541 --> 15:04.458
Patsy!

15:04.541 --> 15:05.541
What's grieving you?

15:08.208 --> 15:09.958
Did you hear about that poor cadet?

15:11.500 --> 15:14.583
- They say it took him hours to die.
- "They"?

15:16.833 --> 15:17.666
Him.

15:31.291 --> 15:34.083
Aren't you meant to be in recital?

15:34.166 --> 15:35.750
Uh… Good evening. Recital?

15:35.833 --> 15:37.291
No, I won't be missed.

15:37.375 --> 15:39.791
They hardly know I'm at the Academy.

15:39.875 --> 15:45.000
And besides, I've learned more
in rooms like this than any classroom.

15:46.166 --> 15:47.250
I don't doubt it.

15:47.333 --> 15:50.875
Sit, please. Please, sit. Have a… Have a…

15:50.958 --> 15:53.541
- Seat?
- Seat. Thank you. Uh…

15:54.583 --> 15:56.708
Fourth Classman Poe. E. A. Poe.

15:57.625 --> 15:59.208
Edgar A. Poe.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.333
Worked up quite a thirst, I see.

16:02.416 --> 16:05.041
Helps take the bite off the gloom.

16:10.958 --> 16:11.791
Um…

16:12.541 --> 16:17.833
So tell me, how did you learn
about Leroy Fry?

16:18.625 --> 16:21.333
Uh, well, from Huntoon, of course.

16:21.416 --> 16:25.625
He has been spouting the news
like the town crier. [chuckles softly]

16:25.708 --> 16:27.916
Perhaps someone
might hang <i>him</i> before too long.

16:29.875 --> 16:32.916
You don't mean to imply
that someone <i>hanged</i> Mr. Fry?

16:33.000 --> 16:34.916
I don't mean to imply anything.

16:37.291 --> 16:43.458
Why do you think that the man
who cut Leroy Fry's heart out

16:44.166 --> 16:45.166
was a poet?

16:45.958 --> 16:46.791
Well…

16:48.583 --> 16:51.750
The heart is a symbol or it is nothing.

16:52.333 --> 16:54.583
Now take away the symbol
and what do you have?

16:56.291 --> 17:00.791
It's a fistful of muscle of no more
aesthetic interest than a bladder.

17:01.500 --> 17:05.083
Now, to remove a man's heart
is to traffic in symbol.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.250
And who better equipped for such labor

17:09.041 --> 17:09.875
than a poet?

17:10.583 --> 17:13.750
Awfully literal-minded poet,
it would seem--

17:13.833 --> 17:16.333
Oh, you cannot pretend
that this act of savagery

17:16.416 --> 17:21.958
did not startle the literary resonances
from the very crevices of your mind.

17:24.583 --> 17:27.041
Lord Suckling's charming song,

17:27.125 --> 17:31.125
<i>"I prithee send me back my heart</i>
<i>Since I cannot have thine"</i>

17:31.208 --> 17:33.333
Or… Or the Bible even,

17:33.416 --> 17:35.291
"Create in me a clean heart, O God."

17:35.375 --> 17:39.416
"A broken and a contrite heart
thou wilt not despise."

17:40.166 --> 17:44.500
Then we might just as easily
be seeking a religious maniac.

17:44.583 --> 17:49.208
No, you see, I neglected
to tell you that I am a poet myself,

17:49.291 --> 17:50.916
hence inclined to think as one.

17:51.000 --> 17:54.333
[exhales heavily]
I don't get around to poetry much.

17:55.083 --> 17:56.875
Why should you? You're an American.

17:58.541 --> 17:59.541
And you?

17:59.625 --> 18:03.708
An artist.
That is to say, without country.

18:03.791 --> 18:07.333
- Oh… [laughing]
- What, Mr. Landor?

18:08.458 --> 18:09.708
You've been a great help.

18:13.458 --> 18:16.916
You want a second look
at a cadet named Loughborough.

18:17.958 --> 18:22.833
In former days, Leroy Fry's roommate,
until they had a falling out.

18:23.833 --> 18:27.375
The nature of which remains uncertain.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.000
[unsettling music playing]

18:47.416 --> 18:48.708
[Hitchcock] Mr. Loughborough.

18:48.791 --> 18:53.208
Tell Mr. Landor
how you were acquainted with Mr. Fry.

18:53.291 --> 18:56.000
Yes, sir. We were roommates.

18:56.083 --> 18:56.916
Hmm.

18:58.375 --> 19:00.750
You ever have a falling out?

19:02.041 --> 19:04.833
I wouldn't call it a falling out. Just…

19:07.125 --> 19:09.625
a matter of diverging paths, sir.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.958
- What made you diverge?
- Well…

19:12.875 --> 19:14.208
Nothing so…

19:16.041 --> 19:17.416
A matter of course.

19:17.500 --> 19:19.916
[sternly] If you know of anything
pertaining to Mr. Fry,

19:20.000 --> 19:21.833
you're bound to disclose it at once.

19:22.875 --> 19:25.666
Well, it's like this, sir.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.958
I'd say he'd fallen in with

19:31.416 --> 19:32.833
a bad bunch.

19:34.208 --> 19:36.166
At least that's what he called them.

19:38.041 --> 19:41.083
[Landor] Now then, tell me,
by "bad bunch,"

19:41.166 --> 19:43.041
did he mean other cadets?

19:43.125 --> 19:46.333
[Loughborough] He never said,
but I assumed so.

19:46.416 --> 19:48.750
And why didn't you come forward earlier?

19:48.833 --> 19:52.041
I didn't quite see
that it had any bearing,

19:53.250 --> 19:55.291
happening so long ago, sir.

19:58.500 --> 19:59.500
Dismissed.

20:02.541 --> 20:03.750
Mr. Stoddard.

20:05.125 --> 20:08.625
You were the last one
to see Mr. Fry alive.

20:10.000 --> 20:11.166
Yes, sir.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.583
- Speak up.
- I'm just a bit ill, sir.

20:14.625 --> 20:18.125
[clears throat] I did see Leroy
late on the night in question.

20:18.875 --> 20:21.500
Passed him on the way
to barracks as I was coming in.

20:23.083 --> 20:24.208
You spoke to him?

20:24.791 --> 20:27.625
He stopped me,
asking if any officers were about.

20:28.708 --> 20:29.791
How did Mr. Fry look?

20:31.708 --> 20:34.875
It was so very dark.
I… I wouldn't trust my memory.

20:35.583 --> 20:39.083
Did you see anything
on his person, a length of rope, maybe?

20:39.791 --> 20:41.666
- None that I could see.
- Hmm.

20:43.791 --> 20:45.541
There was something. Uh…

20:46.208 --> 20:49.875
As Fry was leaving, I did ask
where he was off to at such an hour.

20:50.500 --> 20:51.500
And?

20:52.541 --> 20:54.500
He said, "Necessary business."

20:55.875 --> 20:57.458
What did you take that to mean?

20:59.083 --> 21:00.166
I don't know.

21:04.125 --> 21:06.625
- [Landor clears throat]
- Dismissed.

21:17.833 --> 21:19.750
- [cadet] Pardon me, captain.
- Yes.

21:30.291 --> 21:31.875
Christ almighty.

21:33.208 --> 21:37.416
"A cow and sheep have been
murdered and mutilated in Cold Spring."

21:37.500 --> 21:41.000
"Their chests most cruelly carved open
and their hearts removed."

21:42.583 --> 21:45.583
Are any of God's creatures
immune from this man?

21:45.666 --> 21:48.208
We don't know that this is the same man.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.125
What?

21:50.958 --> 21:52.416
Coincidence, is it?

21:55.625 --> 21:58.000
Effective 0600 tomorrow morning,

21:58.791 --> 22:03.291
all men will only attend
class, meals, prayer services.

22:04.125 --> 22:04.958
Nothing more!

22:15.541 --> 22:17.583
[Landor] If any of your classmates ask,

22:17.666 --> 22:20.583
we did nothing more than discuss
your acquaintance with Leroy Fry.

22:20.666 --> 22:23.166
[Poe] There was no acquaintance.
I never knew him.

22:23.250 --> 22:25.041
- [Landor] What?
- I never knew the fellow.

22:25.583 --> 22:28.708
- [Landor] Then I misunderstood you.
- Huh. You're not the first.

22:29.458 --> 22:31.708
So, if this is not a discussion,
what is it?

22:32.916 --> 22:34.125
An offer of employment.

22:35.250 --> 22:36.250
There's no pay.

22:37.208 --> 22:40.458
None of your classmates
may know what you're doing

22:40.541 --> 22:43.750
until long after you're done with it.

22:43.833 --> 22:47.583
If they do find out,
they'll likely curse your name.

22:47.666 --> 22:51.458
Oh! An irresistible offer.
[chuckles dryly]

22:51.541 --> 22:53.875
No, um, please, tell me more.

22:54.583 --> 22:59.500
Excellent. I need you to decipher this…
This segment of a larger note.

22:59.583 --> 23:04.000
You'll have to work secretly
and as precisely as you can.

23:14.666 --> 23:16.666
[melancholy music playing]

23:41.125 --> 23:43.125
[melancholy music continues]

23:50.416 --> 23:51.458
[knocking at door]

24:02.708 --> 24:06.791
I am pleased to report
I have successfully decoded your message.

24:07.833 --> 24:11.166
Hmm. Handwritten,
it is of a personal nature.

24:11.250 --> 24:13.583
Fry had it with him
at the time of his death.

24:13.666 --> 24:15.833
From that,
we may presume it was sufficient

24:15.916 --> 24:19.083
to draw him from his barracks
on the night in question.

24:19.166 --> 24:22.208
As the rest of the message
was torn from his hand,

24:22.291 --> 24:25.875
we may presume that the note,
in some way, identified its sender.

24:25.958 --> 24:28.833
Now the use
of rather primitive black capitals

24:28.916 --> 24:32.750
would also indicate that the sender
wished to disguise his identity.

24:32.833 --> 24:38.666
An invitation of sorts, or might we
more accurately call it a trap. [claps]

24:39.291 --> 24:40.416
A trap?

24:41.625 --> 24:42.458
Hmm.

24:43.166 --> 24:45.916
- Now, with that in mind… Oh, may I?
- Mmm-hmm.

24:46.625 --> 24:49.708
Let's concentrate
our labors on the third line

24:49.791 --> 24:51.833
which we know, for a fact, is complete.

24:51.916 --> 24:53.416
"Be." But be what?

24:54.000 --> 24:56.541
Something that begins with "L."

24:58.000 --> 24:59.458
"Little"? "Lucky"?

25:00.375 --> 25:04.125
No. Neither gibes with the invitation.

25:04.208 --> 25:09.000
"Be lost"?
No. No. Too ungainly a construction.

25:09.083 --> 25:13.125
If in fact Leroy Fry's attendance was
desired at a particular time and place,

25:13.208 --> 25:15.958
there is but one word, "late."

25:16.583 --> 25:18.958
"Be late."

25:19.666 --> 25:21.208
And as we scan the third line,

25:21.291 --> 25:26.041
the first word becomes almost
insultingly simple to deduce, "don't."

25:26.125 --> 25:29.625
So, "Don't be late."

25:31.541 --> 25:33.791
Now, look closely, Mr. Landor.

25:33.875 --> 25:36.333
We need not journey far
for a suitable candidate.

25:37.125 --> 25:40.333
If Fry is going
to a predetermined location,

25:40.416 --> 25:43.916
he was, from the perspective
of the writer, coming.

25:44.000 --> 25:47.041
So, "Come, Mr. Fry."

25:47.125 --> 25:50.125
Now, with that in place,
it is the height of simplicity

25:50.208 --> 25:53.625
to deduce the next word.
Can it be any other than "soon"?

25:53.708 --> 25:56.125
We insert the word, <i>et voilà!</i>

25:56.208 --> 25:58.541
"Don't be late. Come soon."

25:58.625 --> 26:02.083
And there you have it,
the solution to our <i>petite énigme</i>

26:02.166 --> 26:05.083
- respectfully submitted.
- Mmm-hmm.

26:10.875 --> 26:13.625
First-rate work. I thank you.

26:14.708 --> 26:16.333
- Just one thing.
- Yes?

26:16.416 --> 26:18.750
Did you have any luck
with the first two lines?

26:18.833 --> 26:21.416
Well, I was forced to declare them a loss.

26:22.416 --> 26:23.583
Are you a good speller?

26:23.666 --> 26:26.000
Oh, flawless. Judged so
by no less an authority

26:26.083 --> 26:29.250
than the Reverend John Bransby
of Stoke Newington.

26:29.333 --> 26:35.875
So I take it that you've never done
what so many of… us do.

26:35.958 --> 26:39.791
Misspell similar sounding words.

26:41.375 --> 26:46.916
For example,
"they're," "their," and "there."

26:48.416 --> 26:50.000
A common solecism.

26:50.083 --> 26:52.625
An invitation indeed. "Meet me there."

26:52.708 --> 26:57.125
Of course, we still don't know
where to meet, do we?

26:58.208 --> 27:02.041
Something with "N-G" trailing behind.

27:04.041 --> 27:04.958
The landing!

27:06.291 --> 27:09.750
- And might I add, the cove by the landing.
- Excellent choice.

27:09.833 --> 27:14.958
So, "I'll be at the cove by the landing."

27:15.041 --> 27:17.125
"Meet me there at say, 11:00 p.m. or so."

27:17.208 --> 27:21.541
So, "Don't be late. Come see me."
Might be closer to the mark.

27:21.625 --> 27:23.041
- [Poe] Yeah.
- Ah…

27:23.125 --> 27:25.166
Does this suggest anything to you?

27:25.666 --> 27:28.083
Why would he meet
a fellow cadet at the landing

27:28.958 --> 27:30.541
- when you can meet him anywhere?
- Hmm.

27:32.958 --> 27:37.500
Because it's not a cadet, but a woman.

27:37.583 --> 27:38.416
[Landor] Hmm.

27:39.708 --> 27:43.500
You knew the solution
all along, Mr. Landor.

27:43.583 --> 27:44.708
I had an idea.

27:45.583 --> 27:49.125
Well, if this is indeed a woman we seek,

27:50.791 --> 27:54.083
I believe I may be credited
with a sighting of her.

27:56.083 --> 28:00.625
The morning after Leroy Fry's death,
before I knew anything of what had passed,

28:02.541 --> 28:07.250
I awoke, and began speaking
the opening lines of a poem,

28:09.125 --> 28:14.041
<i>lines that speak of a mysterious woman</i>
<i>in profound distress.</i>

28:14.875 --> 28:20.625
<i>Then, just outside the mess,</i>
<i>appears the most beautiful creature</i>

28:20.708 --> 28:23.041
<i>I've ever had the pleasure</i>
<i>of laying eyes on.</i>

28:28.541 --> 28:29.750
[Landor] <i>Who was she?</i>

28:31.125 --> 28:32.958
I haven't the faintest.

28:33.041 --> 28:37.791
But why do you believe that this poem
or young woman are connected with Mr. Fry?

28:37.875 --> 28:39.916
The air of concealed violence.

28:41.541 --> 28:43.625
Unspeakable duress.

28:45.208 --> 28:46.750
An unknown woman.

28:48.625 --> 28:51.291
You could have woken
any morning and written this.

28:52.041 --> 28:55.166
But I didn't write it. It was dictated.

28:55.791 --> 28:57.458
- Dictated?
- Mmm-hmm.

28:59.291 --> 29:00.125
By whom?

29:02.666 --> 29:03.500
My mother.

29:07.041 --> 29:08.041
She's dead.

29:09.833 --> 29:12.083
Dead nearly, uh, 20 years.

29:19.416 --> 29:21.750
[Landor] <i>Tell me about this Poe fella.</i>

29:24.583 --> 29:26.000
Oh, Poe, he…

29:28.500 --> 29:29.541
A lovely boy.

29:31.416 --> 29:35.583
Beautiful manners. Um… Talks a lot.

29:35.666 --> 29:40.583
Definitely. And definitely
something peculiar about him.

29:41.250 --> 29:42.791
[chuckling] Because he talks a lot?

29:42.875 --> 29:45.291
No, because he's filled
with senseless fantasies.

29:46.375 --> 29:48.000
Tells me about a poem,

29:48.083 --> 29:51.916
claims it has something
to do with Leroy Fry's death.

29:52.000 --> 29:58.958
Claims it was dictated to him
in his sleep by his dead mother.

30:05.541 --> 30:10.375
You of all people know
that the people we lost…

30:12.541 --> 30:14.125
are always with us.

30:19.541 --> 30:23.625
Man will do most anything
to cheat death, won't he?

30:25.541 --> 30:27.541
[pensive music playing]

31:23.916 --> 31:27.708
<i>Wrapped in muslin, maybe, or newspaper.</i>

31:28.291 --> 31:30.375
<i>Very likely surrounded by ice.</i>

31:34.041 --> 31:36.041
[pensive music continues]

34:49.875 --> 34:51.791
[footsteps approaching]

34:51.875 --> 34:55.000
Good. My note reached you.

34:55.083 --> 34:56.791
- Were you followed?
- Followed?

34:57.375 --> 34:59.708
How unprofessional. Certainly not.

35:02.541 --> 35:05.791
- What is this?
- The scene of the crime.

35:06.541 --> 35:08.833
The second… crime.

35:10.708 --> 35:12.750
Where Fry's heart was brought.

35:13.416 --> 35:16.500
You mentioned the taking
of Fry's heart drew you to the Bible.

35:16.583 --> 35:19.208
I must admit.
I was already moving in that direction.

35:19.291 --> 35:21.916
Not to the Bible.

35:22.000 --> 35:24.333
But to religion.

35:25.833 --> 35:30.291
This… This does appear to render
a ceremony of some sort.

35:30.375 --> 35:33.875
Blood and candles placed
in an intentional manner.

35:38.166 --> 35:41.291
- A circle.
- Mmm. And a triangle.

35:42.916 --> 35:47.833
And Fry's heart very likely placed inside.

35:53.541 --> 35:56.708
I have an old friend
who might be of some use.

35:59.166 --> 36:01.166
[pensive music playing]

36:04.625 --> 36:09.000
[Landor] <i>Professor Jean Pépé</i>
<i>is an expert in symbols…</i>

36:09.083 --> 36:10.791
- [Landor] Pépé!
<i>- …rituals…</i>

36:10.875 --> 36:12.000
[knocking at door]

36:12.083 --> 36:14.083
<i>- …the occult.</i>
- Professor!

36:14.166 --> 36:15.083
[Landor] <i>Pépé might be</i>

36:15.166 --> 36:17.541
<i>- the most peculiar man…</i>
- [Pépé] Come in. I'm back here.

36:17.625 --> 36:20.583
- [Landor] Sorry to intrude.
<i>- …I've had the pleasure of coming across.</i>

36:20.666 --> 36:24.625
[Landor] I, uh, bring something curious
I would like you to observe.

36:25.166 --> 36:26.041
[Pépé] Uh…

36:27.291 --> 36:30.041
This can only be a magic circle.

36:31.083 --> 36:34.208
I remember seeing it in
<i>Le Véritable Dragon Rouge.</i>

36:34.291 --> 36:37.708
And if I recall all right,
the magician would stand there

36:39.041 --> 36:40.333
in the triangle.

36:41.166 --> 36:42.083
Alone?

36:42.166 --> 36:44.833
Well, he might have
a group of assistants.

36:44.916 --> 36:47.875
And candles and torches
on either side, light everywhere,

36:47.958 --> 36:49.916
a festival of light, in fact.

36:51.208 --> 36:55.416
Now, Gus, if you go to the third shelf…

36:56.375 --> 36:58.125
On the second to the top.

36:59.166 --> 37:01.125
That volume on the top.

37:02.916 --> 37:05.375
Yes. Yes.

37:08.583 --> 37:11.583
Pierre de Lancre,
redoubtable witch hunter.

37:13.833 --> 37:17.375
- You read French, Mr. Poe?
- Well, yes.

37:17.458 --> 37:20.208
Please read in silence.
It's in the center page.

37:22.708 --> 37:25.875
De Lancre executed 600 Basque witches

37:26.000 --> 37:29.666
and left behind
the remarkable volume you now peruse.

37:29.750 --> 37:34.291
But the book I wish to give you,
<i>Discours du Diable</i> by Henri Le Clerc,

37:34.958 --> 37:38.125
who executed 700 witches
before he was done,

37:38.208 --> 37:39.958
is reputed to have been destroyed.

37:40.041 --> 37:44.541
Now, rumor has it that he left behind
two or three other volumes

37:44.625 --> 37:46.875
identical to the one destroyed.

37:47.958 --> 37:53.000
Now, finding one has become
the <i>idée fixe</i> of many an occult collector.

37:53.583 --> 37:57.333
- Why?
- Why? Ooh… [chuckles]

37:57.416 --> 38:01.958
Le Clerc left behind instructions
for securing…

38:03.250 --> 38:04.250
immortality.

38:05.666 --> 38:06.875
[Poe] Oh, my Lord.

38:08.750 --> 38:13.125
"It is commonly known
among the fraternity of evil angels

38:13.791 --> 38:16.833
that the contents
of a witch's sabbath feast

38:16.916 --> 38:20.041
are confined to the following sundries."

38:20.125 --> 38:24.458
"Unclean animals such as are
never eaten by Christian peoples,

38:25.500 --> 38:28.291
the hearts of unbaptized children,

38:30.166 --> 38:33.333
and the hearts of hanged men."

38:40.375 --> 38:41.375
[drum roll]

38:47.250 --> 38:49.958
[Landor] <i>I need you</i>
<i>to discretely infiltrate the cadets,</i>

38:50.041 --> 38:53.500
<i>see if you can ferret out which of them</i>
<i>may have a connection to the occult.</i>

38:54.625 --> 38:55.708
[Lee] <i>Explain yourself.</i>

38:55.791 --> 38:59.125
Well, um, certain overtures
have been made to me,

38:59.208 --> 39:01.958
rather dark, and shall I say,
unchristian overtures.

39:02.041 --> 39:03.000
- Unchristian?
- Yes.

39:03.083 --> 39:06.000
I've been spurred to question
the very grounds of my faith.

39:06.083 --> 39:09.833
And to dabble in mysterious and arcane
practices of an ancient provenance.

39:09.916 --> 39:12.791
- Arcane practices?
- He means black magic. Who was it?

39:12.875 --> 39:14.375
[clears throat] I demand to know.

39:14.458 --> 39:16.208
[Poe] I'm honor bound
not to reveal his name.

39:16.291 --> 39:17.125
[Lee] Who was it?

39:17.208 --> 39:18.416
You can't drag it from me,

39:18.500 --> 39:21.666
not if God himself threatened
to smite me with a lightning bolt.

39:21.750 --> 39:24.333
- If you want to join our prayers--
- No, I gave my word.

39:24.416 --> 39:27.166
- One asks you to question your faith--
- It must stay private.

39:27.250 --> 39:28.333
Was it Marquis?

39:29.166 --> 39:30.458
Hamilton, watch yourself.

39:31.916 --> 39:34.791
[Poe]<i> Yes, I have a name,</i>
<i>but I need a face to go with it.</i>

39:44.000 --> 39:46.083
- [Dr. Marquis] Vertigo, hmm?
- Mmm.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.666
Well, things are swirling about.

39:49.750 --> 39:52.625
Your heart rate is rather quick.

39:54.875 --> 39:58.375
Very well, Mr. Poe,
keep to the house today

39:58.458 --> 40:00.125
and take care of yourself.

40:01.125 --> 40:05.791
Present this to Lieutenant Locke
and his cadet commandeer,

40:05.875 --> 40:08.041
Artemus, my son.

40:09.166 --> 40:12.333
He'll make sure
you're relieved of your duties.

40:14.250 --> 40:18.250
[Locke] You wish to be excused
from class because you were feeling

40:19.166 --> 40:20.333
vertiginous?

40:20.916 --> 40:23.375
And an even worse ailment not noted.

40:24.083 --> 40:25.458
A grand ennui seizure.

40:26.791 --> 40:27.958
"Grand ennui"?

40:28.041 --> 40:30.416
Of a most pronounced character.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.000
Mind yourself, Poe.

40:32.083 --> 40:33.875
You may ask the doctor yourself.

40:37.375 --> 40:38.500
It's true, Lieutenant.

40:39.166 --> 40:41.791
My father did tell me
he's never seen anything quite like it.

40:41.875 --> 40:42.875
Very well.

40:44.083 --> 40:47.166
But I am charging you
with unbecoming brazenness.

40:47.750 --> 40:48.666
Three demerits.

40:49.291 --> 40:51.666
Return at once to your quarters.

40:51.750 --> 40:54.833
And you would best be there when
the officers come around for inspection.

40:55.750 --> 40:57.458
[drill sergeant shouting commands]

41:08.708 --> 41:10.916
- Poe, is it?
- Yes.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.375
Artemus Marquis.

41:13.208 --> 41:16.000
I must say, your brazenness is admirable.

41:17.875 --> 41:21.083
Tonight, eleven o'clock.
18 North Barracks.

41:25.625 --> 41:28.916
[Poe] Apologies for my tardiness.
I hope I haven't kept you too long.

41:30.041 --> 41:31.708
This is lovely.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.208
[gasps] Books!

41:40.583 --> 41:42.458
You have never interested me more.

41:43.208 --> 41:45.625
Where to begin? Oh…

41:47.375 --> 41:51.958
The lamentable Fenimore Cooper.
I guess every library must have one.

41:52.833 --> 41:54.416
Ooh, what a collection.

41:55.208 --> 41:58.041
History of Egypt, and all sorts.

42:05.041 --> 42:06.416
You've been found out.

42:07.500 --> 42:08.333
Oh?

42:08.916 --> 42:11.000
You gave me to understand
you didn't read poetry.

42:11.583 --> 42:12.791
I don't.

42:14.916 --> 42:15.916
Byron!

42:16.791 --> 42:19.916
- A personal favorite, Mr. Landor…
- Please.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
…and might I say, terribly well-thumbed.

42:22.083 --> 42:23.708
That's my daughter's.

42:31.708 --> 42:32.541
[clears throat]

42:35.166 --> 42:37.375
And your daughter is no longer here?

42:37.458 --> 42:40.958
No. No, she ran off with someone.

42:42.666 --> 42:43.541
Someone you knew?

42:44.916 --> 42:45.875
In passing.

42:46.916 --> 42:48.291
And she's never to return?

42:50.791 --> 42:51.791
Not likely.

42:53.208 --> 42:55.416
Then we're both alone in this world.

42:57.125 --> 42:58.541
But you have your mother.

43:00.375 --> 43:01.833
She still speaks to you.

43:02.750 --> 43:05.208
- At any rate.
- [chuckling] Yes.

43:05.291 --> 43:06.541
Yes, from time to time.

43:07.375 --> 43:12.541
And I might add, whatever's good in me,
in person, in spirit, comes from her.

43:15.125 --> 43:19.250
Your daughter. What's her name?
If you don't object.

43:21.541 --> 43:22.583
Mathilde.

43:25.875 --> 43:26.875
Mattie.

43:30.333 --> 43:32.333
You needn't say anymore, Mr. Landor.

43:36.208 --> 43:40.583
- So you say you found something.
- Well, no. Better than that.

43:40.666 --> 43:43.916
Someone goes by the name Marquis.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.416
The doctor.

43:45.500 --> 43:48.000
No. His son, Artemus.

43:48.541 --> 43:53.000
And I have tasked myself with maneuvering
into his impenetrable peer group.

43:53.625 --> 43:54.458
[door opens]

43:55.208 --> 43:57.541
[Stoddard] Here's another
good creature of God.

43:59.083 --> 44:01.250
Courtesy of <i>la</i> divine Patsy.

44:02.416 --> 44:05.750
[Ballinger] Are you going to report us
for defying curfew, Poe?

44:07.041 --> 44:11.375
Do our wee transgressions offend thee?

44:11.458 --> 44:17.833
Not only am I not offended,
Mr. Ballinger, but, mmm…

44:19.666 --> 44:21.625
another round is in order.

44:22.250 --> 44:23.791
[Artemus chuckles]

44:27.708 --> 44:28.583
[Ballinger] Drink it.

44:30.416 --> 44:31.833
All of it, woman.

44:31.916 --> 44:34.541
[Stoddard] Ballinger, you really
are quite the bully tonight.

44:34.625 --> 44:35.458
[Poe] Mmm.

44:37.833 --> 44:39.083
Another, <i>s'il vous plaît.</i>

44:43.250 --> 44:44.375
Oh, I thank you.

44:46.166 --> 44:47.000
Mmm.

44:47.500 --> 44:49.458
- I can do this all night.
- [Artemus] Uh-uh.

44:50.708 --> 44:51.708
Easy, Ballinger.

44:52.708 --> 44:55.041
I've gone to great trouble
to secure that mash.

44:56.125 --> 44:56.958
Poe.

44:58.125 --> 45:00.000
I understand you're a published poet.

45:00.833 --> 45:03.541
I am told I evidence a humble gift.

45:04.083 --> 45:06.791
[chuckles] Well, then I demand
a public reading.

45:07.666 --> 45:09.750
- Pleasure us.
- Oh. [chuckles]

45:13.833 --> 45:16.791
<i>I met a lewd nude in Bermuda</i>

45:17.458 --> 45:19.208
<i>Who thought she was shrewd</i>

45:20.250 --> 45:21.250
<i>I was shrewder</i>

45:22.000 --> 45:25.791
<i>She thought it quite crude</i>
<i>To be wooed in the nude</i>

45:25.875 --> 45:28.416
<i>I pursued her</i>
<i>Subdued her and screwed her</i>

45:29.458 --> 45:31.125
- [laughing]
- Well done, Poe.

45:31.875 --> 45:32.875
Bravo.

45:36.291 --> 45:39.083
Losing card… is a seven.

45:40.083 --> 45:42.333
Winning card… is a jack.

45:43.458 --> 45:44.333
Oh!

45:44.416 --> 45:46.541
[Artemus] Well, well, well.
It's your lucky day, Poe.

45:47.208 --> 45:48.083
Thank you.

45:49.000 --> 45:53.000
Is it true, Poe, that Detective Landor
interrogated you about Fry?

45:54.458 --> 45:59.208
He was mistakenly under the impression
that I was an intimate of Fry's.

46:00.500 --> 46:01.500
Were you?

46:03.291 --> 46:04.125
I was not.

46:04.833 --> 46:08.041
Fitting that the only thing
that Fry could do to gain attention

46:09.250 --> 46:10.541
was to hang himself.

46:11.833 --> 46:15.708
[Stoddard] I think he hanged himself
in despair over being jilted by a lady.

46:15.791 --> 46:17.791
[Lee] And what lady
might that be, Stoddard?

46:17.875 --> 46:19.708
[Ballinger] What of your sister, Artemus?

46:20.791 --> 46:23.000
Didn't she dazzle Fry?

46:25.875 --> 46:27.333
[Artemus] Oh, come now, Randy.

46:28.041 --> 46:30.500
You were closer to Fry
than anyone in this room.

46:30.583 --> 46:33.750
I don't believe
I was so near to him… [inhales]

46:33.833 --> 46:34.750
…as you.

46:42.541 --> 46:44.791
[chuckles]

46:49.541 --> 46:52.166
All right. Where were we?

46:52.791 --> 46:54.416
[bell tolling in distance]

47:21.083 --> 47:22.291
Halt!

47:23.958 --> 47:26.250
Curfew not apply to you, Mr. Poe?

47:27.375 --> 47:28.541
Explain yourself.

47:28.625 --> 47:32.000
Candles were
to be extinguished three hours ago.

47:32.083 --> 47:33.750
[clears throat] I'm sorry, sir.

47:35.125 --> 47:37.958
Your apologies have always
rung hollow with me.

47:38.875 --> 47:42.375
Leroy Fry met his maker
when he too was out after curfew.

47:44.541 --> 47:46.750
Return to barracks at once.

47:48.583 --> 47:50.916
You're lucky you're not
digging your own grave.

47:53.500 --> 47:54.458
Thank you, sir.

47:54.541 --> 47:55.666
Pick up the pace.

48:00.791 --> 48:02.041
[soft scraping]

48:07.041 --> 48:09.250
[Mathilde muttering indistinctly]

48:20.916 --> 48:22.333
[muttering continues]

48:32.666 --> 48:33.625
[sniffles]

48:34.541 --> 48:35.458
[whispers] Mattie?

48:45.041 --> 48:46.041
[exhales shakily]

48:53.208 --> 48:54.833
[wardrobe opens]

48:56.625 --> 48:57.666
[sighs softly]

48:58.708 --> 49:01.500
[melancholy music playing]

49:01.583 --> 49:02.958
[sobbing]

49:06.500 --> 49:07.666
[sniffling]

49:19.166 --> 49:21.166
[melancholy music continues]

49:31.708 --> 49:34.666
[imperceptible]

49:40.708 --> 49:41.541
[sniffles]

49:48.750 --> 49:50.000
[music fades]

49:50.083 --> 49:55.000
[priest] "Remember thou me
for thy goodness' sake, O Lord."

49:55.833 --> 49:59.333
"For in death
there is no remembrance of thee,

49:59.916 --> 50:03.500
in thy grave who shall give thee thanks?"

50:04.791 --> 50:06.375
"According to thy mercy,

50:06.916 --> 50:11.041
remember thou me
for thy goodness' sake, O Lord."

50:12.000 --> 50:16.250
"Mine eye is consumed because of grief."

50:18.875 --> 50:21.708
You're Mr. Landor. Aren't you?

50:22.375 --> 50:23.208
I am.

50:23.750 --> 50:26.125
[sniffles] I'm Leroy's mother.

50:29.541 --> 50:31.666
I'd like you to have this. [sniffles]

50:32.291 --> 50:33.166
Leroy's diary.

50:34.625 --> 50:36.875
It goes back at least three years.

50:37.541 --> 50:39.166
I don't recall…

50:40.291 --> 50:41.375
I'm sorry.

50:43.083 --> 50:44.166
Terrible loss.

50:46.791 --> 50:50.916
I don't recall any diary
being found with his personal effects.

50:51.000 --> 50:53.875
It was Mr. Ballinger who sent it to me.

50:53.958 --> 50:55.250
- Mr. Ballinger?
- Yes.

50:55.916 --> 50:58.000
As soon as he heard what had happened,

50:58.083 --> 51:01.625
he went straight to Leroy's quarters
to see what could be done.

51:01.708 --> 51:03.458
The dear boy mailed it to me. [sobs]

51:03.541 --> 51:04.375
I see.

51:04.875 --> 51:08.750
And just now… as soon as he saw me,

51:09.875 --> 51:14.583
he said, "I thought you should have
Leroy's diary with you in Kentucky."

51:15.416 --> 51:17.958
"And if you feel like burning it,
go right ahead."

51:19.291 --> 51:20.583
How considerate of him.

51:21.500 --> 51:23.291
But I can make no sense of it.

51:24.208 --> 51:25.750
All the numbers and letters…

51:26.875 --> 51:30.875
But… seeing how the Army
is depending on you,

51:30.958 --> 51:33.625
it seems only right
that you should have it.

51:44.166 --> 51:46.166
[pensive music playing]

52:05.583 --> 52:08.875
[Julia] I'll be back to meet you
all the time.

52:08.958 --> 52:10.875
- To manage her needs…
- [Dr. Marquis] I understand.

52:10.958 --> 52:12.875
…'cause all of us are in this together.

52:14.041 --> 52:15.083
[Landor] Doctor!

52:15.875 --> 52:19.541
[Dr. Marquis] Ah, Mr. Landor.
What a pleasant surprise.

52:20.125 --> 52:23.875
Uh, please, let me introduce you
to my wife, Julia.

52:25.333 --> 52:27.625
I've heard so much about you.

52:27.708 --> 52:29.125
It's a pleasure.

52:29.208 --> 52:32.958
Aren't you the gentleman
inquiring after Mr. Fry's death?

52:33.833 --> 52:34.666
I am.

52:34.750 --> 52:36.833
Well, we were just discussing the matter.

52:37.458 --> 52:43.666
Indeed, my husband informs me
that despite his own heroic efforts,

52:43.750 --> 52:49.625
the body of Mr. Fry had been judged
too far along for public display.

52:50.541 --> 52:51.375
Hmm.

52:52.083 --> 52:54.208
His poor parents.

52:54.708 --> 52:55.708
Oh. Indeed.

52:55.791 --> 52:58.916
Well, this whole matter has shaken us.

53:00.916 --> 53:03.916
Be assured, I won't rest
until we've apprehended him.

53:08.708 --> 53:10.708
Lovely to make your acquaintance.

53:11.416 --> 53:12.500
My dear.

53:12.583 --> 53:15.833
I understand you're a widower, Mr. Landor.

53:17.708 --> 53:18.916
That is so.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.708
Well, all due sympathy.

53:22.333 --> 53:25.833
Was it recent?
Your wife going to her reward?

53:26.500 --> 53:27.541
Two years ago now.

53:28.291 --> 53:33.041
Only a few months
after we moved to the Highlands.

53:33.750 --> 53:35.916
A sudden illness, was it?

53:38.458 --> 53:39.291
Not sudden…

53:40.833 --> 53:41.666
enough.

53:42.750 --> 53:46.375
Well, your sacrifices aren't lost on me.

53:47.583 --> 53:50.000
- Condolences.
- Thank you.

53:50.750 --> 53:52.083
[Julia] Hmm.

53:59.208 --> 54:02.458
- [piano playing]
- [wind whistling]

54:27.416 --> 54:28.333
Brava.

54:29.375 --> 54:32.166
Edgar, did I not tell you
my sister is a prodigy?

54:32.250 --> 54:35.500
Marvelous, my dear.
Brought a tear to my eye.

54:35.583 --> 54:36.458
[Poe] Yeah.

54:37.041 --> 54:39.125
A lovely run, Miss Marquis.

54:39.208 --> 54:40.666
- Truly.
- Yes.

54:41.333 --> 54:43.375
Your immortality is assured.

54:44.000 --> 54:46.958
I can't think of any woman
who wishes to be immortal, Randy.

54:47.041 --> 54:50.375
I am at once reminded
of Sir Thomas Grey's,

54:51.000 --> 54:53.750
<i>"Full many a flower</i>
<i>Is born to blush unseen"</i>

54:53.833 --> 54:56.583
<i>"And waste its sweetness</i>
<i>On the desert air"</i>

54:58.000 --> 54:59.041
A favorite, Mr. Poe.

55:02.083 --> 55:05.250
And what do you think
of my little protégé?

55:06.166 --> 55:08.791
I think Mr. Poe is far beyond
being anyone's protégé.

55:09.625 --> 55:12.000
He's certainly not to be corrupted
by the likes of you.

55:12.541 --> 55:14.750
[cadets chuckle]

55:14.833 --> 55:15.833
[Julia] All right, Lea.

55:15.916 --> 55:19.333
That's enough now.
You need to rest before dinner.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.875
- [coughs] If you'll excuse me, gentlemen.
- [Ballinger] Thank you, Lea.

55:24.625 --> 55:25.875
[Artemus] Randy, chairs.

55:26.583 --> 55:28.208
Stoddard, come on, man. Chess board.

55:29.958 --> 55:31.208
All right. I'm bored now.

55:31.291 --> 55:33.541
[Julia] I don't care! She's ill.

55:33.625 --> 55:36.125
In her condition,
she shouldn't be entertaining at all.

55:36.750 --> 55:37.708
[Poe] Miss Marquis.

55:38.250 --> 55:40.750
Oh, um… Pardon me.

55:44.833 --> 55:49.916
Nothing would afford me greater pleasure
than an audience with you on Saturday.

55:51.791 --> 55:56.291
I'm sure that's true, Mr. Poe,
but… I'm afraid I'm engaged Saturday.

55:57.000 --> 55:58.208
Ah, I see.

55:58.750 --> 56:01.375
[in French]
Your coat and your hat, sir.

56:01.458 --> 56:04.250
Thank you, Eugenia. You needn't have.

56:04.333 --> 56:06.833
I could have fetched my coat myself.

56:06.916 --> 56:08.833
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

56:11.208 --> 56:13.000
You speak French, Mr. Poe.

56:14.041 --> 56:16.666
With an accent that is rather charming.

56:22.291 --> 56:24.083
[in English] So you propose this Saturday?

56:25.250 --> 56:28.041
Or Sunday, if that's preferable.

56:29.916 --> 56:30.916
Or Monday, even.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.250
And where do you propose this audience?

56:33.333 --> 56:35.916
Let me guess.
Gee's Point? Flirtation Walk?

56:36.000 --> 56:37.000
Oh, no, no, no.

56:37.541 --> 56:38.875
Neither, I'm afraid, no.

56:39.708 --> 56:41.458
I had in mind the cemetery.

56:42.333 --> 56:43.833
- The cemetery?
- Mmm.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.333
How interesting.

56:47.416 --> 56:48.750
Yes, I certainly think so.

56:51.666 --> 56:53.541
Well, I wish you good evening.

56:54.375 --> 56:56.375
[intriguing music playing]

57:03.666 --> 57:04.500
[door closes]

57:52.250 --> 57:53.708
[Lea] <i>It's all so bare now.</i>

57:54.625 --> 57:57.750
But to enjoy the Highlands
in the full extent of their glory,

57:58.291 --> 58:01.541
it must be seen immediately
after the fall of the leaf.

58:02.583 --> 58:03.416
Why is that?

58:04.125 --> 58:06.083
Vegetation does not improve,

58:06.166 --> 58:09.541
but rather obstructs
God's originating design.

58:10.250 --> 58:11.458
A romantic.

58:12.916 --> 58:16.000
You do enjoy talking
about God and death, don't you?

58:16.625 --> 58:20.291
I do consider death
to be poetry's most exalted theme.

58:21.833 --> 58:23.833
[coughing]

58:28.208 --> 58:29.208
Shall we?

58:33.708 --> 58:36.041
- A lovely spot.
- [sighs] Yes, it's my favorite.

58:41.333 --> 58:44.333
How well it sits on you, morbidity.

58:46.125 --> 58:47.875
Suits you better than your uniform.

58:50.583 --> 58:52.666
The only one to match you is Artemus.

58:54.041 --> 58:57.333
I've never seen him dwell
in the realms of melancholy.

58:58.875 --> 59:02.041
He does consent
to visit our world for long intervals.

59:13.916 --> 59:16.541
[Lea] <i>You know I believe it's possible</i>
<i>to dance on broken glass</i>

59:16.625 --> 59:18.250
<i>for some length of time.</i>

59:18.916 --> 59:20.125
Not forever.

59:24.958 --> 59:27.583
Yes, I can see you two
hold much in common.

59:28.875 --> 59:31.166
[coughing]

59:35.625 --> 59:37.166
I hope you aren't cold.

59:37.250 --> 59:39.250
[unsettling music playing]

59:40.208 --> 59:42.458
The frigid climate
has clearly settled in for good.

59:42.541 --> 59:43.541
Please, let us not.

59:44.166 --> 59:47.166
Do not suppose I came here
to talk about the weather. How prosaic.

59:48.000 --> 59:50.666
I'm sorry.
My sole concern was for your welfare.

59:50.750 --> 59:52.000
Proceed then, by all means.

59:52.083 --> 59:55.750
Declare your undying love, so we may
both return home and be none the worse.

59:55.833 --> 59:58.458
- I was just saying--
- I'm sorry.

59:59.708 --> 1:00:02.166
Sorry, I'm being a horror,
and I have no idea why.

1:00:05.208 --> 1:00:06.333
You are cold.

1:00:06.416 --> 1:00:08.791
Miss Marquis, would you
like to borrow my cloak?

1:00:09.791 --> 1:00:11.750
- Quite all right.
- It's really no, um…

1:00:11.833 --> 1:00:12.666
I…

1:00:13.625 --> 1:00:14.708
[gulps]

1:00:14.791 --> 1:00:16.000
- What?
- Miss Marquis.

1:00:16.083 --> 1:00:18.541
- Lea! Lea!
- [whimpering]

1:00:18.625 --> 1:00:20.333
[music crescendoes]

1:00:20.416 --> 1:00:22.000
[choking]

1:00:22.083 --> 1:00:25.541
Lea! Lea? What's happening?

1:00:25.625 --> 1:00:26.458
Lea!

1:00:28.875 --> 1:00:29.708
Lea.

1:00:30.416 --> 1:00:31.250
[choking stops]

1:00:31.833 --> 1:00:33.083
[breathing deeply]

1:00:37.916 --> 1:00:39.083
My God, Lea.

1:00:40.666 --> 1:00:41.833
Are you all right?

1:00:44.375 --> 1:00:46.083
- Lea?
- I'm rather fine.

1:00:56.666 --> 1:01:00.458
[Poe] <i>Are you sure you're all right?</i>
<i>I was quite terrified.</i>

1:01:01.083 --> 1:01:03.625
[Lea] <i>It happens.</i>
<i>It's nothing to worry about.</i>

1:01:05.083 --> 1:01:06.125
Your, um…

1:01:07.500 --> 1:01:12.916
Your spirit so emboldens me
that I feel free to confess…

1:01:14.458 --> 1:01:19.458
my mother has
a kind of presence in my life.

1:01:20.791 --> 1:01:23.583
My sleepings and my awakenings.

1:01:24.500 --> 1:01:25.833
Yes. Yes.

1:01:25.916 --> 1:01:31.083
At times, I believe the dead haunt us
because we love them too little.

1:01:32.416 --> 1:01:36.250
We forget them, you see.
We don't mean to, but we do.

1:01:37.291 --> 1:01:42.833
I believe they feel most cruelly deserted,
and so they clamor for us.

1:01:44.041 --> 1:01:47.083
Perhaps it best we don't give
that too much thought.

1:01:58.291 --> 1:02:00.208
I want you to know how grateful I was…

1:02:02.833 --> 1:02:04.625
to open my eyes and find you there.

1:02:05.916 --> 1:02:07.291
To look deep within you

1:02:08.250 --> 1:02:10.583
and find something
I would never have expected.

1:02:12.125 --> 1:02:13.666
Not in a thousand years.

1:02:15.666 --> 1:02:16.666
Thank you.

1:02:26.875 --> 1:02:28.750
[animals howling]

[groaning]

1:03:23.208 --> 1:03:26.041
Bastards ought to know
their fucking place.

1:03:28.625 --> 1:03:31.083
- [Poe groaning]
- [Ballinger] Stay away from Lea.

1:03:32.333 --> 1:03:33.791
[Landor grunts]

1:03:33.875 --> 1:03:34.708
Leave off!

1:03:34.791 --> 1:03:37.000
- [Ballinger grunts]
- [Poe groaning]

1:03:37.083 --> 1:03:38.208
[Landor grunts]

1:03:38.291 --> 1:03:39.500
Leave off, Ballinger!

1:03:39.583 --> 1:03:42.958
Or you will be court-martialed!

1:03:43.541 --> 1:03:44.541
[Poe groans]

1:03:55.333 --> 1:03:56.500
[Ballinger] Ugly fuck.

1:04:01.166 --> 1:04:02.166
[Landor] You all right?

1:04:02.250 --> 1:04:06.000
Clearly that savage knows
that Lea prefers me to him.

1:04:06.083 --> 1:04:08.416
- And if he seeks to frighten me away--
- Frighten?

1:04:08.500 --> 1:04:11.541
- He looked set on killing you.
- Killing me? Oh!

1:04:12.166 --> 1:04:16.291
Oh, no. Before I let him come
between me and my heart's desire,

1:04:16.375 --> 1:04:18.041
I will kill <i>him.</i>

1:04:20.666 --> 1:04:24.083
It's always been this way.
People underestimating me.

1:04:24.166 --> 1:04:27.250
Friends, classmates,
my very own benefactor.

1:04:27.333 --> 1:04:28.750
- Thank you, Patsy.
- Everyone.

1:04:29.375 --> 1:04:30.416
Everyone…

1:04:33.625 --> 1:04:34.625
but my dear mother.

1:04:37.041 --> 1:04:40.333
And thank you for assisting earlier.

1:04:41.125 --> 1:04:43.250
It's unlike me to be caught by surprise.

1:04:43.333 --> 1:04:47.333
And you surprise too. Don't you, Landor?

1:04:48.458 --> 1:04:50.750
I have no desire to offend,

1:04:50.833 --> 1:04:54.750
but you're much more sophisticated
than you present.

1:04:55.541 --> 1:04:59.708
[chuckles] Now, tell me, is it true
you once solicited a confession

1:04:59.791 --> 1:05:02.250
with nothing more than a piercing look?

1:05:02.333 --> 1:05:04.333
[chuckles]

1:05:09.625 --> 1:05:11.333
With enough patience,

1:05:12.500 --> 1:05:16.291
the suspect will often
interrogate himself.

1:05:20.541 --> 1:05:23.583
Well, you are most
delightful company, Landor.

1:05:26.750 --> 1:05:28.666
I shall write a poem someday.

1:05:29.791 --> 1:05:33.208
Something that shall send
your name down through the ages.

1:05:51.208 --> 1:05:55.250
[Patsy] <i>Even after this attack,</i>
<i>you don't suspect Randy Ballinger?</i>

1:05:57.541 --> 1:05:59.125
So where does this leave you?

1:06:00.041 --> 1:06:01.375
Your investigation.

1:06:02.375 --> 1:06:05.458
I'm interested in Artemus Marquis.

1:06:06.875 --> 1:06:08.041
I take it you know him?

1:06:10.541 --> 1:06:11.708
Well, who doesn't?

1:06:13.791 --> 1:06:15.416
<i>Glorious look to him.</i>

1:06:16.875 --> 1:06:20.208
<i>He'd almost have</i>
<i>to die young, wouldn't he?</i>

1:06:22.958 --> 1:06:26.250
<i>But I wouldn't have</i>
<i>picked him for the violent sort.</i>

1:06:27.541 --> 1:06:29.541
<i>Always, um, very cool.</i>

1:06:32.041 --> 1:06:33.416
[Landor] <i>Perhaps he's not our man.</i>

1:06:35.333 --> 1:06:39.208
<i>There's a quality to him.</i>
<i>To his entire family.</i>

1:06:39.291 --> 1:06:42.125
<i>They act like people</i>
<i>who are guilty of something.</i>

1:06:45.875 --> 1:06:48.291
Aren't all families guilty of something?

1:06:51.833 --> 1:06:52.833
[knocking at door]

1:06:55.708 --> 1:06:58.166
- Captain.
- It's Mr. Ballinger.

1:06:59.208 --> 1:07:01.083
I'm afraid he's gone missing.

1:07:02.458 --> 1:07:04.666
[dramatic music playing]

1:07:07.375 --> 1:07:09.000
[indistinct chatter]

1:07:14.708 --> 1:07:16.291
[cadet 1] Next to those rocks.

1:07:17.708 --> 1:07:19.166
[cadet 2] Here on this side too.

1:07:22.625 --> 1:07:23.916
[cadet 3] Up the hill.

1:07:24.708 --> 1:07:28.125
[cadet 4] Cadet, right side.
Behind those trees.

1:07:28.875 --> 1:07:29.958
[cadet 5] Nothing here.

1:07:30.958 --> 1:07:32.958
[indistinct chatter continues]

1:07:41.416 --> 1:07:43.666
[Lee] Captain! Up here!

1:07:55.833 --> 1:07:56.833
[Hitchcock] My Lord.

1:08:19.541 --> 1:08:25.833
[Dr. Marquis] Mr. Ballinger's dissection
wasn't as clean as Fry's.

1:08:26.500 --> 1:08:29.708
Suggesting it was performed
by different hands.

1:08:31.958 --> 1:08:34.583
As for the castration…

1:08:36.791 --> 1:08:38.750
[hesitates] Well, I'm…

1:08:38.833 --> 1:08:39.875
[Thayer] Castration?

1:08:40.708 --> 1:08:42.208
My God, Landor.

1:08:43.166 --> 1:08:45.833
We're no closer to finding
who's responsible for this

1:08:45.916 --> 1:08:47.291
than we were a month ago!

1:08:47.875 --> 1:08:48.875
We are closer.

1:08:49.541 --> 1:08:51.208
- It's only a matter of time.
- Tell me!

1:08:52.916 --> 1:08:55.583
Have you found
more evidence of satanic practices?

1:08:57.250 --> 1:09:00.541
What of the so-called officer
who persuaded Private Cochrane

1:09:00.625 --> 1:09:02.291
to abandon Leroy Fry's body?

1:09:03.666 --> 1:09:04.625
Or Fry's diary?

1:09:04.708 --> 1:09:07.833
Have you found a single clue
that might be of use?

1:09:08.750 --> 1:09:13.875
A maniac is freely roaming these hills,
disemboweling my men.

1:09:13.958 --> 1:09:18.416
Men who barely carry out their duties,
hardly leave their barracks or sleep.

1:09:18.500 --> 1:09:21.250
And if they can sleep,
do so with their muskets!

1:09:21.833 --> 1:09:22.666
[scoffs]

1:09:26.750 --> 1:09:29.666
I'm beginning to believe
you no longer think I'm competent

1:09:30.291 --> 1:09:31.916
to undertake this investigation.

1:09:33.166 --> 1:09:34.166
Thank you, doctor.

1:09:41.541 --> 1:09:45.208
It's not your competence we question,
it's your allegiance.

1:09:45.750 --> 1:09:50.166
Is there any possibility that this
could have been the work of Mr. Poe?

1:09:51.208 --> 1:09:52.041
Poe?

1:09:52.125 --> 1:09:54.791
Just yesterday,
he was regaling his table mates

1:09:54.875 --> 1:09:58.500
with an heroic account
of his epic tussle with Mr. Ballinger,

1:09:58.583 --> 1:10:02.083
declaring that he
fully intended to kill him

1:10:02.166 --> 1:10:04.500
should they ever cross swords again.

1:10:04.583 --> 1:10:06.208
You've seen Poe.

1:10:07.166 --> 1:10:11.291
Can you honestly tell me
he subdued Ballinger?

1:10:11.375 --> 1:10:15.083
No, there would have been no need.
Firearm would have turned the trick.

1:10:15.166 --> 1:10:17.583
Whatever his relations with Ballinger,

1:10:17.666 --> 1:10:21.958
there's no sign of any link
between Poe and Leroy Fry.

1:10:22.041 --> 1:10:25.125
- They didn't even know each other.
- [Thayer] Oh, but they did.

1:10:25.958 --> 1:10:28.791
They had a tussle
of their own last summer.

1:10:30.458 --> 1:10:33.958
I don't suppose he ever volunteered
that bit of information, did he?

1:10:34.041 --> 1:10:36.041
[pensive music building]

1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:40.125
Then arrest him.

1:10:40.916 --> 1:10:43.958
Arrest him if you are so persuaded.

1:10:44.041 --> 1:10:45.958
All we have is motive.

1:10:46.583 --> 1:10:49.166
We're looking to you to supply evidence!

1:10:50.541 --> 1:10:54.958
Mr. Landor, do you harbor
a latent hostility toward this Academy?

1:10:55.541 --> 1:10:56.541
Is that it?

1:10:59.541 --> 1:11:05.208
I am risking my life
on behalf of your precious institution.

1:11:08.416 --> 1:11:09.250
But yes.

1:11:11.166 --> 1:11:16.875
I do believe that the Academy
takes away a young man's will.

1:11:17.458 --> 1:11:21.125
It fences him with regulations and rules.

1:11:22.541 --> 1:11:27.291
Deprives him of reason.
It makes him less human.

1:11:27.375 --> 1:11:32.125
Are you implying
the Academy is to blame for these deaths?

1:11:32.208 --> 1:11:36.500
Someone connected to the Academy, yes.
Hence, the Academy itself.

1:11:36.583 --> 1:11:38.000
[Hitchcock] Well, that's absurd.

1:11:38.083 --> 1:11:39.291
By your standard,

1:11:40.041 --> 1:11:44.000
every crime committed
by a Christian will be a stain on Christ.

1:11:45.500 --> 1:11:46.541
And so it is.

1:11:47.291 --> 1:11:49.791
[pensive music continues]

1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000
[music fades]

1:12:02.458 --> 1:12:07.583
When I first asked you… to take this job,

1:12:09.250 --> 1:12:16.166
you told me you never
had dealings with Leroy Fry, so, uh…

1:12:17.750 --> 1:12:20.333
Let's start there. Well?

1:12:23.791 --> 1:12:26.541
- Well, that's not entirely true--
- Well… Well… Well…

1:12:26.625 --> 1:12:29.166
Why is nothing simple with you, Poe?

1:12:29.250 --> 1:12:31.666
Where are the facts?
Where are the simple facts?

1:12:31.750 --> 1:12:34.083
Yes! Or no!

1:12:35.625 --> 1:12:36.625
The truth!

1:12:38.458 --> 1:12:43.083
- Did you know Leroy Fry?
- Yes.

1:12:44.125 --> 1:12:47.333
Did you have words with Leroy Fry?

1:12:48.625 --> 1:12:50.208
Yes. Yes.

1:12:55.125 --> 1:12:57.291
Did you kill Leroy Fry?

1:12:59.958 --> 1:13:02.916
Did you kill Randolph Ballinger?

1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:03.833
[softly] No.

1:13:06.500 --> 1:13:07.333
[exhales]

1:13:10.083 --> 1:13:15.375
Did you have anything to do
with the desecrating of their bodies?

1:13:15.458 --> 1:13:18.916
- No, no, no. May I be struck dead if I--
- But you do not deny

1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.791
that you threatened both men?

1:13:21.875 --> 1:13:25.125
Well, as it relates
to Ballinger, that was…

1:13:29.750 --> 1:13:30.833
I never meant it.

1:13:32.375 --> 1:13:35.750
- And Fry?
- I never once threatened him. I merely--

1:13:35.833 --> 1:13:41.000
There is
a very disturbing pattern here, Poe.

1:13:41.083 --> 1:13:46.791
Men who cross you
end up on the wrong end of a noose

1:13:46.875 --> 1:13:51.958
with rather important organs
carved from their chests.

1:13:52.791 --> 1:13:54.041
Mr. Landor…

1:13:57.791 --> 1:13:59.958
[sighs deeply]
If I were to kill every cadet

1:14:00.041 --> 1:14:02.958
who had abused me
during my brief tenure here,

1:14:04.833 --> 1:14:08.041
I'm afraid you would find
the Corp of Cadets

1:14:08.125 --> 1:14:09.791
reduced to less than a dozen.

1:14:14.041 --> 1:14:17.250
Now, if you must know,
I've been a figure of fun

1:14:18.208 --> 1:14:19.833
from my very first day here.

1:14:21.458 --> 1:14:26.375
My manner, my age, my person…

1:14:28.875 --> 1:14:30.291
my aesthetics.

1:14:32.291 --> 1:14:36.666
If I had a thousand lifetimes,

1:14:36.750 --> 1:14:39.166
I could not begin
to address all the injuries

1:14:39.250 --> 1:14:40.583
that have been done to me.

1:14:42.375 --> 1:14:48.250
Yes, I am guilty of a great,
great many things, but never that.

1:14:50.916 --> 1:14:52.208
Never murder.

1:14:55.458 --> 1:14:56.875
Now do you believe me?

1:14:59.833 --> 1:15:06.166
I believe that you should take better care
of what you say and do.

1:15:09.666 --> 1:15:14.416
For now, I can probably
hold off Hitchcock.

1:15:15.833 --> 1:15:21.833
But if you ever lie to me again,

1:15:21.916 --> 1:15:27.250
they can clap you in irons
and I won't lift a finger to help you.

1:15:27.333 --> 1:15:30.458
Do you understand me?

1:15:39.500 --> 1:15:43.333
Now if you'll excuse me,
I'm expected for dinner.

1:15:50.583 --> 1:15:51.583
[exhales]

1:16:08.958 --> 1:16:15.916
Thank you for joining us
in mourning Randolph's untimely passing.

1:16:17.208 --> 1:16:19.541
The dear boy was family.

1:16:24.333 --> 1:16:28.875
Don't you find my son
exceptionally handsome, Mr. Landor?

1:16:32.458 --> 1:16:33.333
Um…

1:16:34.708 --> 1:16:41.083
I would judge both of your children
to have been blessed in that regard.

1:16:42.166 --> 1:16:44.583
[Julia] Yes, we are hereditarily blessed.

1:16:45.166 --> 1:16:50.000
But I must say, I do find you a rarity.

1:16:51.125 --> 1:16:54.458
A person of exceptional intelligence.

1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:59.291
The quality in such
ridiculously short supply here.

1:17:00.916 --> 1:17:03.666
[Artemus] And with that intelligence,
Mr. Landor,

1:17:04.500 --> 1:17:07.166
I hope when you're finished
with your official business,

1:17:07.250 --> 1:17:10.541
you will assist me
with a puzzle of my own.

1:17:11.083 --> 1:17:13.916
- Oh, a puzzle?
- The strangest affair.

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:15.958
While in recital, Monday,

1:17:16.541 --> 1:17:20.416
it appears someone
had rifled through my belongings.

1:17:21.541 --> 1:17:23.250
- [Landor] Oh.
- [Dr. Marquis] Well, eh…

1:17:23.916 --> 1:17:27.125
- Terrible people are abroad.
- Really, Father?

1:17:27.500 --> 1:17:30.416
I was inclining toward the theory
that the fellow was simply rude,

1:17:30.500 --> 1:17:33.166
while, of course,
having no idea who he was.

1:17:35.333 --> 1:17:39.041
All the same,
you must be careful, Artemus.

1:17:39.833 --> 1:17:41.625
- You really must.
- Oh, Mother.

1:17:42.500 --> 1:17:45.625
It was probably
just some tiresome old fellow

1:17:45.708 --> 1:17:50.208
with nothing better to do
and no life of his own to speak of.

1:17:50.791 --> 1:17:53.958
A rustic sort of cottager.

1:17:55.000 --> 1:17:56.416
Don't you think, Mr. Landor?

1:17:58.625 --> 1:18:00.041
Oh.

1:18:00.125 --> 1:18:02.125
- You have a cottage, don't you?
- Artemus.

1:18:02.958 --> 1:18:06.208
You may even have some
very near relations who fit the pattern.

1:18:06.291 --> 1:18:09.541
Perhaps a dear friend who likes
a tipple and to drink in a tavern.

1:18:10.541 --> 1:18:13.083
Stop it! Just, please! I hate it!

1:18:13.625 --> 1:18:16.000
I positively hate it
when you take on like this.

1:18:16.083 --> 1:18:18.750
- I don't follow your drift, Mother.
- Oh, no, I'm sure you don't.

1:18:18.833 --> 1:18:21.875
I might drift clear to the other side
of the Hudson and no one would care.

1:18:21.958 --> 1:18:23.583
No one would follow!

1:18:24.083 --> 1:18:26.458
- Would they, Daniel?
- [Dr. Marquis] Son, please.

1:18:28.708 --> 1:18:30.041
[sobbing]

1:18:35.041 --> 1:18:35.875
[door slams]

1:18:36.416 --> 1:18:40.416
You'll… have to forgive my wife.

1:18:42.375 --> 1:18:45.250
Mr. Ballinger's death

1:18:46.750 --> 1:18:50.291
has cast a pall
over our happy little clan.

1:18:58.041 --> 1:19:02.458
I wonder if you'd care
to join me in my study, Mr. Landor?

1:19:02.541 --> 1:19:03.541
I'd be delighted.

1:19:11.875 --> 1:19:14.250
[Dr. Marquis] My apologies, constable.

1:19:16.458 --> 1:19:20.791
Living on pins and needles
has taken its toll on all of us.

1:19:20.875 --> 1:19:23.041
- No need to apologize.
- [chuckles softly] Yeah.

1:19:23.833 --> 1:19:28.375
And the time of year,
all this confinement…

1:19:28.458 --> 1:19:31.791
Mmm. It is all very understandable.

1:19:36.333 --> 1:19:39.541
I couldn't help noticing, doctor.

1:19:42.166 --> 1:19:44.208
Is your daughter unwell?

1:19:45.833 --> 1:19:47.208
Quite observant.

1:19:48.458 --> 1:19:49.458
Yes.

1:19:51.166 --> 1:19:52.708
Yes, she's…

1:19:54.750 --> 1:19:57.791
She's had a rough go of it, that one.

1:19:58.500 --> 1:20:00.541
Since she was a pup, really.

1:20:01.500 --> 1:20:06.583
A ghastly illness
seizing her when no one is looking,

1:20:06.666 --> 1:20:11.750
stopping her brain
and shaking her like a gourd.

1:20:12.541 --> 1:20:14.291
Beautiful child.

1:20:15.458 --> 1:20:20.125
One marked for marriage, status, children.

1:20:21.750 --> 1:20:25.583
And in the same stroke, illness.

1:20:25.666 --> 1:20:27.500
[piano playing faintly outside]

1:20:29.125 --> 1:20:30.125
'Tis dreadful.

1:20:31.458 --> 1:20:32.458
[door opens]

1:20:33.416 --> 1:20:37.000
Gentlemen, Lea is in fine form
if you'd join us.

1:20:38.208 --> 1:20:39.208
Thank you, son.

1:20:42.541 --> 1:20:43.541
Shall we?

1:20:44.333 --> 1:20:48.250
If you don't mind,
I'll just step out for some fresh air.

1:20:48.333 --> 1:20:49.291
Of course.

1:20:52.875 --> 1:20:54.375
[piano continues playing]

1:20:55.291 --> 1:20:58.291
[Artemus] Father, have a game with me.

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:03.166
[Dr. Marquis]
Shall I try the scholars again

1:21:03.958 --> 1:21:07.000
or something more challenging this time?

1:21:25.625 --> 1:21:27.625
[piano music continues]

1:21:29.166 --> 1:21:31.125
[indistinct conversation]

1:21:42.916 --> 1:21:44.916
[faint piano music continues]

1:22:56.875 --> 1:22:58.875
[music ends]

1:23:05.375 --> 1:23:08.166
- Just remarkable.
- Hardly.

1:23:09.208 --> 1:23:10.208
Passable, maybe.

1:23:10.875 --> 1:23:14.416
You don't realize the effect
your playing has on me.

1:23:16.166 --> 1:23:18.166
On all of us, really, I…

1:23:20.375 --> 1:23:23.208
- Yes?
- Well, I…

1:23:26.583 --> 1:23:33.333
I don't quite know how else to put it,
but, um… I've come to realize

1:23:35.291 --> 1:23:37.708
that I would do most anything for you.

1:23:44.833 --> 1:23:45.958
Oh, Edgar.

1:23:50.125 --> 1:23:52.125
[suspenseful music playing]

1:24:10.458 --> 1:24:13.500
[Julia] May I help you
find something, Mr. Landor?

1:24:14.916 --> 1:24:17.500
You've recovered. And so soon.

1:24:18.458 --> 1:24:19.791
Well, do forgive me.

1:24:19.875 --> 1:24:23.791
I feared I was coming down with
one of those horrid migraines,

1:24:23.875 --> 1:24:28.333
but it seems a moment's rest
was all I required.

1:24:28.416 --> 1:24:31.375
And I feel quite cured. Mmm.

1:24:34.833 --> 1:24:37.708
Let's put that dreadful,
old thing away, shall we?

1:24:37.791 --> 1:24:40.125
I'm quite sure it won't fit you.

1:24:42.208 --> 1:24:44.333
The good doctor and I
were in search of it.

1:24:45.125 --> 1:24:46.208
And I found it.

1:24:47.291 --> 1:24:52.083
[Julia] Look what the constable
found in our closet, darling.

1:24:52.666 --> 1:24:58.083
Remember Artemus wearing it
as a young lad around the house?

1:24:58.916 --> 1:25:00.208
Remember, love?

1:25:00.291 --> 1:25:02.500
- I remember, Mother.
- It's my brother's coat.

1:25:02.583 --> 1:25:03.833
Your brother's?

1:25:03.916 --> 1:25:06.500
That's the only thing
we have to remember him by.

1:25:07.166 --> 1:25:08.791
- [knocking on door]
- Why do you have it?

1:25:08.875 --> 1:25:10.500
Perhaps Artemus can answer that.

1:25:11.083 --> 1:25:14.833
[door opens and closes]

1:25:17.416 --> 1:25:19.041
[Eugenia] Everyone is in the salon.

1:25:21.583 --> 1:25:22.916
[Dr. Marquis] Ethan.

1:25:24.916 --> 1:25:26.166
What brings you here?

1:25:27.583 --> 1:25:28.875
Another cadet is missing.

1:25:31.875 --> 1:25:35.250
And I've formed a search party
ready to go within the hour.

1:25:35.333 --> 1:25:37.458
No stone will be left unturned.

1:25:37.541 --> 1:25:39.583
[Thayer] God help us. I shudder to think--

1:25:39.666 --> 1:25:40.500
[Landor] Gentlemen!

1:25:40.583 --> 1:25:43.375
I've just been to Mr. Stoddard's quarters.

1:25:43.458 --> 1:25:48.166
His trunk was empty. No civilian clothes
were to be found anywhere.

1:25:48.250 --> 1:25:50.375
I believe he has run off.

1:25:51.500 --> 1:25:52.500
Run off?

1:25:52.583 --> 1:25:54.750
Fry's diary allows

1:25:54.833 --> 1:25:58.791
that both Stoddard and Ballinger
were good mates with Leroy Fry.

1:25:58.875 --> 1:26:00.958
Fearing he might be next, I think he ran.

1:26:01.041 --> 1:26:04.708
Well, that may well be, but what about
Artemus and the officer's coat?

1:26:04.791 --> 1:26:08.250
If he's involved, how can
we possibly delay arresting him?

1:26:08.333 --> 1:26:13.208
He is… too cool a customer for that.
All he has to do is deny it.

1:26:14.041 --> 1:26:17.291
Now, there's a last avenue
of inquiry I'm exploring.

1:26:17.791 --> 1:26:19.750
Two of his closest companions are dead,

1:26:19.833 --> 1:26:23.083
and imminently, I must report
to the president that we have our man.

1:26:24.791 --> 1:26:27.333
We have our man, Landor. Do we not?

1:26:31.000 --> 1:26:33.708
[dramatic music playing]

1:26:44.833 --> 1:26:45.833
[Eugenia] <i>Mademoiselle.</i>

1:26:47.666 --> 1:26:48.666
Edgar.

1:26:53.250 --> 1:26:54.958
- [Poe] I, uh…
- [Landor] <i>Professor?</i>

1:26:58.000 --> 1:26:59.000
Pépé?

1:27:01.333 --> 1:27:05.875
Last time I was here,
you mentioned a witch hunter and a book.

1:27:05.958 --> 1:27:08.791
Yes. <i>Discours du Diable.</i>

1:27:08.875 --> 1:27:10.791
Henri Le Clerc.

1:27:11.333 --> 1:27:13.166
Was Le Clerc a priest?

1:27:14.041 --> 1:27:15.416
One burned at the stake.

1:27:19.458 --> 1:27:21.208
[Poe] <i>It came to me while I slept</i>

1:27:23.791 --> 1:27:25.791
<i>Down, down, down</i>

1:27:26.791 --> 1:27:30.000
<i>Came the hot threshing flurry</i>

1:27:32.333 --> 1:27:34.791
<i>Ill at heart, I beseeched her to hurry</i>

1:27:36.791 --> 1:27:37.958
<i>"Lenore"</i>

1:27:40.166 --> 1:27:42.375
<i>She forbore the reply</i>

1:27:44.041 --> 1:27:46.416
<i>Endless night</i>
<i>Caught her then in its slurry</i>

1:27:46.500 --> 1:27:48.666
<i>Shrouding all, but her pale blue eye</i>

1:27:48.750 --> 1:27:51.833
<i>Darkest night, black with hell</i>

1:27:51.916 --> 1:27:53.500
<i>Charneled fury</i>

1:27:55.375 --> 1:27:56.708
<i>Leaving only</i>

1:27:58.041 --> 1:27:59.458
<i>That deathly blue eye</i>

1:28:06.416 --> 1:28:07.416
Do you see?

1:28:10.250 --> 1:28:11.291
Lenore.

1:28:12.750 --> 1:28:13.833
Lea.

1:28:15.291 --> 1:28:18.625
It speaks of your unspeakable distress.

1:28:20.166 --> 1:28:24.166
A conclusion to what's… oppressing you.

1:28:24.750 --> 1:28:25.666
The poem…

1:28:28.958 --> 1:28:30.541
is speaking to us.

1:28:41.375 --> 1:28:44.500
Remember when you said
you'd do anything for me?

1:28:47.458 --> 1:28:48.791
Your devil worshipper.

1:28:54.416 --> 1:28:56.250
- Thank you, Pépé.
- Yeah.

1:29:03.041 --> 1:29:04.916
[footsteps approaching]

1:29:09.541 --> 1:29:10.583
Mr. Landor.

1:29:12.500 --> 1:29:13.583
Your family.

1:29:16.791 --> 1:29:20.333
Your family… have been

1:29:21.833 --> 1:29:22.833
quite a puzzle.

1:29:24.041 --> 1:29:29.041
I could never get a fix
of who was in command.

1:29:29.833 --> 1:29:32.625
One time or other I suspected each of you.

1:29:32.708 --> 1:29:34.750
It never occurred to me

1:29:36.583 --> 1:29:40.250
that it might be someone
who wasn't even alive.

1:29:41.875 --> 1:29:42.958
[voice shaking] Pardon me?

1:29:43.041 --> 1:29:46.875
Father Henri Le Clerc.

1:29:47.666 --> 1:29:51.500
Finest of witch hunters,

1:29:52.333 --> 1:29:55.083
until he became the hunted.

1:29:56.458 --> 1:29:58.250
What are you talking about?

1:29:59.166 --> 1:30:04.250
Your daughter, she suffers
from a falling sickness, does she not?

1:30:04.750 --> 1:30:08.291
She copes because
she is in contact with someone.

1:30:08.375 --> 1:30:10.791
Someone who instructs her.

1:30:13.041 --> 1:30:14.041
Him.

1:30:14.916 --> 1:30:19.375
Do not make me question
your sanity, Mr. Landor.

1:30:19.458 --> 1:30:21.666
Uh, what are you suggesting?

1:30:27.041 --> 1:30:33.833
Le Clerc's incredibly rare
<i>Discours du Diable.</i>

1:30:37.916 --> 1:30:42.500
Well, communicating with the devil

1:30:43.250 --> 1:30:47.083
is not a pastime
with which I am familiar, Mr. Landor.

1:30:47.625 --> 1:30:50.958
[hesitating]
I have never read a page of this book.

1:30:51.041 --> 1:30:55.541
Does your daughter speak with the dead?!

1:30:59.083 --> 1:31:01.083
[somber music playing]

1:31:12.083 --> 1:31:16.000
Over the years, the seizures
have gotten much, much worse.

1:31:17.583 --> 1:31:18.416
I…

1:31:19.125 --> 1:31:25.083
I have tried
every medical regimen I could think of.

1:31:25.958 --> 1:31:28.833
She was given three months to live.

1:31:29.583 --> 1:31:32.125
Do you know
what it feels like to go to sleep,

1:31:32.208 --> 1:31:35.208
not knowing if your daughter
will make it through the night?

1:31:36.083 --> 1:31:39.625
But then, one day she came to me,

1:31:41.041 --> 1:31:44.583
and said that she'd met someone.

1:31:44.666 --> 1:31:46.875
Her great-great-grandfather.

1:31:47.541 --> 1:31:48.416
Le Clerc?

1:31:49.333 --> 1:31:51.041
Henri Le Clerc wasn't evil.

1:31:53.291 --> 1:31:55.333
He… He was misunderstood.

1:31:56.041 --> 1:31:57.375
[whispering indistinctly]

1:32:25.500 --> 1:32:27.791
[Lea breathing deeply]

1:32:27.875 --> 1:32:29.583
[speaking Latin]

1:32:48.583 --> 1:32:52.916
They swore to me Mr. Fry was already dead.

1:32:53.000 --> 1:32:55.083
They swore they could never kill anyone.

1:32:55.166 --> 1:32:57.125
You believed them.

1:32:57.208 --> 1:32:58.791
I had no choice.

1:32:58.875 --> 1:33:01.791
You are a physician! A man of science!

1:33:01.875 --> 1:33:05.125
How dare you
put your faith in such madness?

1:33:05.208 --> 1:33:06.041
Because…

1:33:07.083 --> 1:33:11.000
Because I… I… I couldn't save her myself.

1:33:11.750 --> 1:33:14.208
My own art had failed me.

1:33:16.458 --> 1:33:19.500
I sacrificed everything for my Lea.

1:33:20.125 --> 1:33:23.250
So how can I then object
to her finding a cure elsewhere?

1:33:23.333 --> 1:33:24.291
Doctor.

1:33:25.916 --> 1:33:27.750
Communicating with the dead…

1:33:29.958 --> 1:33:32.333
that's not normal. But murder…

1:33:34.625 --> 1:33:36.333
destroying innocent lives…

1:33:39.500 --> 1:33:40.750
that's inhuman.

1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:46.375
Someone has to hang for this.

1:33:46.458 --> 1:33:47.750
[coughing]

1:33:48.541 --> 1:33:54.083
[hesitating]
I only indulged her because… miraculously,

1:33:55.333 --> 1:33:57.041
she seemed to improve.

1:33:58.250 --> 1:34:00.666
Doctor, where is your family?

1:34:02.250 --> 1:34:03.875
Where are your children?

1:34:05.083 --> 1:34:07.333
Mr. Poe was here earlier.

1:34:08.958 --> 1:34:12.291
He left with… With Artemus.

1:34:13.125 --> 1:34:15.875
Why is his cloak still in the hall?

1:34:17.500 --> 1:34:18.791
Doctor, where is Lea?

1:34:20.625 --> 1:34:22.625
Doctor, where is your family?

1:34:22.708 --> 1:34:26.291
[dramatic musical flourish]

1:34:28.541 --> 1:34:31.125
- [Lea breathing deeply]
- [Artemus] It's starting to wear off.

1:34:32.375 --> 1:34:33.333
[Julia] Lea.

1:34:36.833 --> 1:34:38.041
Continue.

1:34:40.125 --> 1:34:42.125
[Julia speaking Latin]

1:34:42.750 --> 1:34:44.708
[unsettling music playing]

1:34:44.791 --> 1:34:46.375
[continues speaking Latin]

1:35:00.958 --> 1:35:01.791
[Poe groans]

1:35:05.250 --> 1:35:06.250
[Poe] What's happening?

1:35:08.500 --> 1:35:09.500
[Poe groans]

1:35:09.583 --> 1:35:11.000
It won't be much longer.

1:35:11.083 --> 1:35:14.208
I don't feel terribly well.

1:35:16.875 --> 1:35:19.875
- I thought…
- No. [shushing]

1:35:22.083 --> 1:35:25.625
Just a few minutes more and I'll be free.

1:35:29.375 --> 1:35:30.541
Free?

1:35:30.625 --> 1:35:31.625
Yes.

1:35:33.291 --> 1:35:35.500
Please, Lea. I'm…

1:35:37.708 --> 1:35:39.041
This must happen.

1:35:40.666 --> 1:35:41.916
You do understand.

1:35:42.833 --> 1:35:46.375
Sacrifice is
the ultimate expression of love.

1:35:47.583 --> 1:35:51.833
I knew from the moment I met you,
you were the one.

1:35:53.791 --> 1:35:54.791
Lea.

1:35:55.333 --> 1:35:57.791
- Yes?
- I do love you.

1:36:12.458 --> 1:36:14.000
[Lea and Julia speaking Latin]

1:36:27.166 --> 1:36:28.666
Artemus…

1:36:30.625 --> 1:36:31.791
[Landor] Enough!

1:36:32.458 --> 1:36:33.416
[Lea whimpers]

1:36:33.500 --> 1:36:35.750
[dramatic music playing]

1:36:37.583 --> 1:36:39.541
- Get out!
- You'll hang for this!

1:36:39.625 --> 1:36:41.708
- [Artemus] You've no business here!
- Lea, finish!

1:36:41.791 --> 1:36:44.750
Mrs. Marquis, do you
wish to see your children hang?

1:36:44.833 --> 1:36:47.208
- Don't listen. He's bluffing!
- Continue.

1:36:47.291 --> 1:36:49.750
- Lea!
- That's Fry's heart, no?

1:36:49.833 --> 1:36:51.708
- Landor.
- [Julia] Lea, continue!

1:36:51.791 --> 1:36:54.791
Ballinger, he'd do anything for you,
even murder a man.

1:36:54.875 --> 1:36:56.333
And, Artemus, you killed him.

1:36:56.416 --> 1:36:58.666
Please, just leave us alone.
It's almost done.

1:36:58.750 --> 1:37:00.958
- Lea, finish!
- Lea, it is done!

1:37:01.791 --> 1:37:02.791
It was you.

1:37:03.500 --> 1:37:06.375
It was you who lured Fry out with a note--

1:37:06.458 --> 1:37:08.083
It wasn't her idea! It was mine!

1:37:08.166 --> 1:37:09.791
- I did it!
- No! Artemus!

1:37:09.875 --> 1:37:11.333
- [Julia] No!
- [Landor grunts]

1:37:11.416 --> 1:37:12.791
[Lea screaming] Stop!

1:37:13.416 --> 1:37:14.791
[both grunting]

1:37:16.750 --> 1:37:17.750
[Lea] Stop!

1:37:19.333 --> 1:37:20.333
[Julia] Lea!

1:37:23.500 --> 1:37:24.833
[speaking Latin]

1:37:27.375 --> 1:37:28.500
[grunting continues]

1:37:36.291 --> 1:37:38.833
- [shouting in Latin]
- [wood creaking]

1:37:43.416 --> 1:37:44.500
[Lea grunts]

1:37:46.208 --> 1:37:47.041
Lea!

1:37:47.125 --> 1:37:49.166
- [Julia] Lea! Lea!
- Lea!

1:37:49.708 --> 1:37:50.666
[fire roaring]

1:37:50.750 --> 1:37:54.958
[Julia] Artemus. Artemus, help her.
Help her!

1:37:55.541 --> 1:37:57.583
[groaning and coughing]

1:37:59.708 --> 1:38:01.125
[Artemus] Mother, stay back!

1:38:01.208 --> 1:38:02.375
[Julia] Artemus.

1:38:02.458 --> 1:38:05.041
Lea. Lea! Lea!

1:38:06.083 --> 1:38:08.500
- Artemus! Artemus!
- [coughing]

1:38:08.583 --> 1:38:11.208
- I can't leave her!
- No!

1:38:11.291 --> 1:38:15.500
Artemus, no. Artemus!

1:38:15.583 --> 1:38:17.166
Artemus! No!

1:38:18.375 --> 1:38:19.750
[Julia shrieks]

1:38:21.416 --> 1:38:24.375
- [Landor grunts]
- [Julia] Let me go! No!

1:38:25.833 --> 1:38:27.250
No, Artemus!

1:38:28.625 --> 1:38:29.958
[wood creaking]

1:38:35.166 --> 1:38:36.458
[Julia wailing]

1:38:41.666 --> 1:38:43.458
Artemus! No!

1:38:44.875 --> 1:38:47.458
[Poe] Lea! Lea!

1:38:47.541 --> 1:38:49.375
[Julia] No!

1:38:49.458 --> 1:38:51.416
[wailing] No!

1:38:51.500 --> 1:38:52.500
[Landor] Move!

1:39:02.166 --> 1:39:04.166
[music fades]

1:39:13.625 --> 1:39:15.041
[bell tolling in distance]

1:39:20.708 --> 1:39:22.708
[footsteps approaching]

1:39:40.000 --> 1:39:43.291
I'm told he's lost no more blood
than a physician would have drawn

1:39:43.375 --> 1:39:45.125
in the course of a normal bleeding.

1:39:46.291 --> 1:39:48.250
Might have been the best thing for him.

1:39:51.625 --> 1:39:54.166
More to life than meets the eye,
Landor, I admit.

1:39:55.333 --> 1:39:56.625
I couldn't agree more.

1:39:58.083 --> 1:40:01.000
So what now of Mrs. Marquis?

1:40:02.083 --> 1:40:04.791
Grieving as only a mother can.

1:40:05.708 --> 1:40:08.041
The magistrate felt she'd suffered enough.

1:40:10.000 --> 1:40:11.500
But you'll be pleased to know

1:40:11.583 --> 1:40:15.333
our good doctor
has submitted his resignation.

1:40:16.958 --> 1:40:21.541
None of this pleases me, I can assure you.

1:40:24.750 --> 1:40:25.750
Landor.

1:40:33.208 --> 1:40:38.375
You and I could not be more dissimilar
in manner, philosophy.

1:40:41.458 --> 1:40:43.208
But I wish to convey

1:40:43.291 --> 1:40:46.416
that if this business
has ever rendered me…

1:40:49.375 --> 1:40:54.750
Which is to say, if ever out
of impertinence, I have impugned…

1:40:57.250 --> 1:40:58.375
your competence…

1:41:00.916 --> 1:41:02.000
then I'm sorry.

1:41:05.166 --> 1:41:06.208
Thank you, captain.

1:41:17.333 --> 1:41:21.125
How could I have dined and fraternized
with the man all of these years?

1:41:22.166 --> 1:41:24.625
Known his family almost as well as my own

1:41:24.708 --> 1:41:27.125
and never fathomed
the depths of their distress.

1:41:28.125 --> 1:41:29.791
By design, colonel.

1:41:31.208 --> 1:41:32.041
Yes.

1:41:33.458 --> 1:41:36.833
Yes, I suppose shame on me.

1:41:39.125 --> 1:41:42.500
I can only assume
Artemus murdered Mr. Ballinger

1:41:42.583 --> 1:41:44.875
to prevent him
from alerting the authorities,

1:41:44.958 --> 1:41:48.916
and Mr. Stoddard ran
rather than become the next victim.

1:41:49.625 --> 1:41:51.125
[Landor] You can assume that, yes.

1:41:53.250 --> 1:41:54.666
Well, Landor,

1:41:57.416 --> 1:42:01.041
I declare your contractual duties
fulfilled to the letter.

1:42:01.875 --> 1:42:04.083
I hereby release you from your contract.

1:42:05.666 --> 1:42:07.375
I hope that won't displease you.

1:42:07.458 --> 1:42:11.625
At the very least, I hope
you won't object to accepting our thanks.

1:42:14.666 --> 1:42:20.375
The jackals in Washington
will soon be in retreat, I hope.

1:42:21.125 --> 1:42:24.125
I believe we have won a stay of execution.

1:42:24.791 --> 1:42:26.750
No. Colonel.

1:42:29.833 --> 1:42:31.833
[pensive music playing]

1:42:59.916 --> 1:43:01.833
Don't you look fully recovered.

1:43:10.083 --> 1:43:11.458
I know about your daughter.

1:43:15.916 --> 1:43:17.250
[sighs] Very well.

1:43:18.916 --> 1:43:21.500
What does Mattie have to do with anything?

1:43:21.583 --> 1:43:22.541
Everything.

1:43:23.875 --> 1:43:25.333
As you know full well.

1:44:01.500 --> 1:44:03.000
It came to me while I slept.

1:44:03.708 --> 1:44:05.708
[somber music playing]

1:44:07.458 --> 1:44:08.875
[gasps]

1:44:16.625 --> 1:44:20.750
The note… found in Leroy Fry's hand.

1:44:21.375 --> 1:44:25.166
The note left for him
luring the poor bloke from his barracks.

1:44:27.208 --> 1:44:29.541
You were careless enough
to leave that with me.

1:44:38.791 --> 1:44:41.041
This is the other note you left.

1:44:43.666 --> 1:44:44.791
<i>Remember?</i>

1:44:49.166 --> 1:44:50.166
<i>I'm most</i>

1:44:51.541 --> 1:44:53.750
struck by the shape of your characters.

1:44:54.708 --> 1:44:58.125
Uppercase, as you well know,
are every bit as damning as lowercase.

1:44:58.208 --> 1:45:01.125
The A, the R, the G and the E,

1:45:01.208 --> 1:45:05.708
virtually identical to the ones
found in Leroy Fry's note.

1:45:07.416 --> 1:45:11.625
You can imagine my astonishment.

1:45:13.833 --> 1:45:17.416
Could the same man
have written both notes?

1:45:18.875 --> 1:45:23.791
And why would Landor have
any reason to correspond with Leroy Fry?

1:45:26.416 --> 1:45:30.875
As luck would have it,
I ran into <i>la</i> divine Patsy.

1:45:34.625 --> 1:45:36.041
His daughter Mattie…

1:45:36.125 --> 1:45:37.833
[Poe]<i> She told me the whole story.</i>

1:45:39.291 --> 1:45:41.833
<i>Returning home from the Academy Ball…</i>

1:45:42.500 --> 1:45:44.166
- [man 1] Grab her!
- [Mathilde screaming]

1:45:44.250 --> 1:45:45.458
- [man 2] Hold her.
- No!

1:45:45.541 --> 1:45:47.041
[Poe] <i>…your Mattie was raped…</i>

1:45:47.583 --> 1:45:48.833
[Mathilde] No!

1:45:48.916 --> 1:45:51.500
<i>…and left for dead</i>
<i>by three nameless ruffians.</i>

1:45:51.583 --> 1:45:52.500
[man 1] Quiet.

1:45:53.375 --> 1:45:55.958
- Please, no! No!
- [man 1] Julius, grab her legs!

1:45:56.041 --> 1:45:58.416
- No! No, no, no!
- Grab her!

1:45:59.583 --> 1:46:01.708
- Legs! Legs! Hold her down!
- No!

1:46:01.791 --> 1:46:03.583
- Keep her still.
- Please!

1:46:03.666 --> 1:46:05.333
[Poe] <i>A bad bunch, indeed.</i>

1:46:05.416 --> 1:46:06.250
[Landor] Mattie.

1:46:06.791 --> 1:46:08.375
[Poe] <i>Just as Leroy Fry had said.</i>

1:46:10.250 --> 1:46:11.250
Mattie?

1:46:12.250 --> 1:46:14.333
Oh, God! Mattie.

1:46:14.416 --> 1:46:16.500
- Oh, my God! Come here.
- [crying]

1:46:20.666 --> 1:46:22.375
Mattie. [crying]

1:46:23.458 --> 1:46:24.916
[Mathilde] I'm sorry.

1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:27.375
[sobbing]

1:46:27.458 --> 1:46:29.041
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

1:46:29.791 --> 1:46:32.625
Everything will be all right.

1:46:35.125 --> 1:46:36.125
It'll all turn out.

1:46:36.958 --> 1:46:38.958
[somber music playing]

1:47:05.666 --> 1:47:07.375
[Mathilde whispering indistinctly]

1:47:11.708 --> 1:47:13.916
Mattie, he cannot help you.

1:47:15.625 --> 1:47:18.041
- Please, my love. Let me help you.
- [sniffles]

1:47:20.916 --> 1:47:22.333
[panting]

1:47:25.125 --> 1:47:29.250
[Poe] But she didn't run away, did she?

1:47:43.416 --> 1:47:44.291
[Landor] Mattie?

1:47:49.708 --> 1:47:50.541
Mattie.

1:47:57.541 --> 1:47:58.541
Mattie.

1:48:06.833 --> 1:48:09.416
Mattie, please. Come here.

1:48:13.250 --> 1:48:16.250
Please, my love. Come here.
Please come here.

1:48:16.916 --> 1:48:18.041
Don't.

1:48:18.125 --> 1:48:19.791
Everything will be all right.

1:48:21.583 --> 1:48:23.375
[voice breaking] Please, Mattie.
Come back.

1:48:24.666 --> 1:48:25.916
It'll all turn out.

1:48:29.375 --> 1:48:30.208
Don't.

1:48:31.541 --> 1:48:32.541
I love you.

1:48:33.083 --> 1:48:35.000
[music swells]

1:48:46.666 --> 1:48:48.666
[music fades]

1:48:55.041 --> 1:48:56.458
Why did you never tell me?

1:48:58.250 --> 1:48:59.375
It's not a story

1:49:01.250 --> 1:49:02.291
I enjoy telling.

1:49:06.041 --> 1:49:07.666
But I would have comforted you.

1:49:09.666 --> 1:49:12.916
Helped you as you helped me.

1:49:16.208 --> 1:49:17.041
[sniffles]

1:49:17.875 --> 1:49:22.958
I don't think I can
be comforted on that particular subject.

1:49:29.416 --> 1:49:32.375
So what did I do next?

1:49:34.125 --> 1:49:37.291
Exactly what you would have done.

1:49:37.375 --> 1:49:40.541
Examined all assumptions, beginning with

1:49:41.500 --> 1:49:44.083
what were the chances that two parties

1:49:44.166 --> 1:49:48.750
would have had designs
on the same cadet in the same evening?

1:49:48.833 --> 1:49:49.708
Small!

1:49:50.791 --> 1:49:52.041
Small indeed!

1:49:53.916 --> 1:49:58.958
Unless we see one party
as being contingent upon the other,

1:49:59.041 --> 1:50:02.041
or what if one party say, Artemus and Lea,

1:50:02.125 --> 1:50:05.875
what if they were simply
on the lookout for a dead body.

1:50:05.958 --> 1:50:08.125
And then the opportunity
magically appears,

1:50:08.208 --> 1:50:11.958
and they don't care who the body is,
provided it had a heart.

1:50:12.041 --> 1:50:15.208
The one thing
they won't do for it is kill.

1:50:15.291 --> 1:50:19.416
No, it is the other party
who is ready and willing to kill.

1:50:21.458 --> 1:50:23.708
And to kill this man in particular.

1:50:23.791 --> 1:50:25.333
Why? Why?

1:50:32.625 --> 1:50:35.166
Might it be revenge, Landor?

1:50:42.166 --> 1:50:44.166
[distant animal calls]

1:50:50.583 --> 1:50:53.416
Patsy? Patsy?

1:50:54.083 --> 1:50:55.750
- [Landor grunts]
- [Fry struggling]

1:50:58.458 --> 1:50:59.291
[screaming]

1:51:01.250 --> 1:51:02.083
[Landor grunts]

1:51:06.083 --> 1:51:07.583
- [Fry] Help!
- Who was with you?

1:51:14.958 --> 1:51:16.916
[struggling, choking]

1:51:28.708 --> 1:51:29.541
[choking stops]

1:51:30.958 --> 1:51:32.666
[rustling]

1:51:34.250 --> 1:51:35.291
[Huntoon] Someone there?

1:51:41.333 --> 1:51:42.166
Hello?

1:51:55.916 --> 1:51:57.000
[shudders]

1:52:08.916 --> 1:52:13.166
[Poe] <i>So… the second party is interrupted,</i>

1:52:14.916 --> 1:52:17.541
<i>though not before</i>
<i>his successful resolution.</i>

1:52:19.458 --> 1:52:22.125
<i>Steals back to his cottage</i>
<i>in Buttermilk Falls,</i>

1:52:23.708 --> 1:52:25.291
where he has escaped unnoticed.

1:52:27.000 --> 1:52:31.291
But he's shocked at being summoned back
to West Point the very next day

1:52:32.583 --> 1:52:35.333
to learn that in the intervening hours,

1:52:35.416 --> 1:52:38.916
the dead man's body
has been most horribly mutilated.

1:52:39.625 --> 1:52:43.541
Thus providing his crimes
with an extraordinary cover.

1:52:43.625 --> 1:52:44.458
Hmm.

1:52:46.250 --> 1:52:48.833
He must think God himself was on his side.

1:52:50.291 --> 1:52:54.833
Being engaged to solve
the very crimes that he himself committed.

1:52:57.208 --> 1:53:03.166
And as a result, Artemus and Lea
will forever go down as murderers.

1:53:03.250 --> 1:53:06.416
Ah… There's no forever about it.

1:53:07.208 --> 1:53:10.916
They will be forgotten
just like the rest of us.

1:53:11.541 --> 1:53:14.041
I shall not forget them!

1:53:16.166 --> 1:53:17.875
Especially my Lea.

1:53:20.541 --> 1:53:23.625
She was to be a wife, Landor, a mother.

1:53:27.875 --> 1:53:31.166
Nor shall I forget how you
played the rest of us as fools.

1:53:32.791 --> 1:53:33.791
Fools.

1:53:37.583 --> 1:53:39.291
But I was your prize fool.

1:53:41.291 --> 1:53:43.291
- Was I not?
- No.

1:53:49.458 --> 1:53:53.333
You were the one who I was
to deliver myself to all along.

1:53:53.416 --> 1:53:57.625
I knew that from the moment
I first met you, and here we are.

1:54:01.875 --> 1:54:02.875
[Landor sniffles]

1:54:03.791 --> 1:54:04.958
I, uh…

1:54:06.250 --> 1:54:07.208
[sighs]

1:54:08.625 --> 1:54:11.166
If you want me to say I'm sorry, I will.

1:54:13.083 --> 1:54:14.583
I don't want your apologies.

1:54:16.541 --> 1:54:19.291
No. I want answers.

1:54:21.416 --> 1:54:24.291
How did you know
it was Fry who raped Mattie?

1:54:33.500 --> 1:54:35.416
The sheep and the cows, your doing?

1:54:36.708 --> 1:54:39.041
- Of course.
- And Ballinger?

1:54:39.541 --> 1:54:40.708
Mmm-hmm.

1:54:43.333 --> 1:54:44.958
[sighs deeply] Ballinger.

1:54:45.750 --> 1:54:47.333
I had to cut his heart out.

1:54:48.541 --> 1:54:50.875
Had to make it look
like the work of satanists.

1:54:50.958 --> 1:54:53.333
That is no easy job for an old man.

1:54:55.125 --> 1:54:57.791
How did you learn
of Ballinger's involvement?

1:55:01.041 --> 1:55:02.041
Fry's diary.

1:55:05.166 --> 1:55:07.083
Did Ballinger confess as well?

1:55:07.166 --> 1:55:10.500
- Oh, yes, under duress.
- [Ballinger] <i>No, please!</i>

1:55:10.583 --> 1:55:12.000
- [thunder rumbling]
- [Ballinger grunts]

1:55:12.083 --> 1:55:14.333
Who else was with you?!

1:55:14.416 --> 1:55:15.625
Julius Stoddard.

1:55:18.000 --> 1:55:18.833
Julius.

1:55:21.041 --> 1:55:21.958
Sorry.

1:55:22.041 --> 1:55:24.250
[Ballinger grunting, coughing]

1:55:24.333 --> 1:55:25.333
They both…

1:55:28.458 --> 1:55:30.250
They both recalled her name,

1:55:31.541 --> 1:55:35.958
and I made certain
that he recalled what she was wearing.

1:55:36.791 --> 1:55:39.250
Every detail of her dress.

1:55:39.958 --> 1:55:43.458
Only Stoddard, it seems,
has escaped your justice.

1:55:44.083 --> 1:55:50.541
I haven't… the strength
or the will to chase him down.

1:55:50.625 --> 1:55:51.750
I only hope…

1:55:54.833 --> 1:56:00.583
that he spends the rest of his…
miserable life looking over his shoulder.

1:56:02.250 --> 1:56:08.333
What they did
was an appalling, savage thing.

1:56:09.750 --> 1:56:13.333
But you might have gone straight
to Thayer, secured a confession.

1:56:13.416 --> 1:56:15.125
I didn't want them to confess.

1:56:18.750 --> 1:56:21.250
I wanted them to die.

1:56:31.916 --> 1:56:33.041
And so what now?

1:56:35.791 --> 1:56:36.666
What now?

1:56:38.333 --> 1:56:39.583
That depends on you.

1:56:49.666 --> 1:56:51.750
I have a pair of notes…

1:56:54.041 --> 1:56:55.958
that will send you to the gallows.

1:57:19.041 --> 1:57:20.083
Very well.

1:57:33.791 --> 1:57:35.791
[Poe sighs softly]

1:58:17.750 --> 1:58:21.625
You know, Edgar, I often wish

1:58:22.916 --> 1:58:25.916
that my Mattie had run into you

1:58:27.583 --> 1:58:31.250
that night… of the ball.

1:58:34.041 --> 1:58:35.041
Who knows?

1:58:42.708 --> 1:58:44.583
We might have become a family indeed.

1:58:51.375 --> 1:58:52.250
[inhales sharply]

1:58:52.333 --> 1:58:53.750
I sure treasure…

1:58:58.958 --> 1:59:01.458
[breathes shakily]

1:59:01.541 --> 1:59:05.250

2:00:36.333 --> 2:00:37.791

[dramatic music playing]

2:02:47.750 --> 2:02:49.750
[melancholy music playing]
