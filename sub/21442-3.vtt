00:07.741 --> 00:09.175
- What's up, guys?

00:09.242 --> 00:11.144
Thanks for joining us here today
on "The Dude Perfect Show."

00:11.211 --> 00:12.445
Today, we have
a very special guest.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.381
You may know him as Max
from "The Thundermans,"

00:14.447 --> 00:15.482
Jack Griffo.
- Yeah!

00:15.548 --> 00:17.283
- Thanks for joining us, Jack!
- Come on!

00:17.350 --> 00:19.619
- Thank you for having me.
I'm super excited to be here.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.921
- It's gonna be a lot of fun.
How's your dodgeball game?

00:21.988 --> 00:22.989
- It's pretty good, Tyler.

00:23.056 --> 00:25.158
I've played dodgeball
for many years.

00:25.225 --> 00:27.694
I'd say around
a decade and a half probably.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.029
- That's a good amount of time.
- I've got some practice.

00:30.096 --> 00:32.399
- Oh, that's 15 years.
- Yeah, that's a lot--

00:32.465 --> 00:34.367
- That's good math.
- Yeah, okay, perfect.

00:34.434 --> 00:36.136
Now I don't wanna
call anybody a cheater,

00:36.202 --> 00:39.172
but dodgeball relies
so heavily on the honor system.

00:39.239 --> 00:42.108
One member of our group
just seems to cheat a lot.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.279
- If it hits your shirt,
you're not out.

00:46.346 --> 00:48.415
- Yes, you are.
You're absolutely out.

00:48.481 --> 00:50.717
So the goal today
is to foolproof dodgeball

00:50.784 --> 00:52.118
for that specific reason.

00:52.185 --> 00:54.220
Jack, give us some time
to sort this out.

00:54.287 --> 00:56.256
Rejoin us for the game.
It's gonna be a good time.

00:56.322 --> 00:57.390

I'm changing the dodgeball game.

01:20.647 --> 01:22.982
- Cody tries to cheat,
so just keep an eye on him.

01:23.049 --> 01:25.051
- Throw a T-shirt on.

01:25.118 --> 01:27.554
- We already have T-shirts on.
- I can see that.

01:27.620 --> 01:28.988
Here's the big one.

01:29.055 --> 01:31.357
- Who are we playing against
if we're all on the black team?

01:31.424 --> 01:33.393
- Why don't you just be patient,
put your shirt on.

01:33.460 --> 01:35.061
- You got me
like a cottony linen.

01:35.128 --> 01:36.963
- Cods, I think that's
actually a ski base layer.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.332
- You're going skiing after?
- No, I'm not.

01:39.399 --> 01:40.700
- Yeah, okay.

01:40.767 --> 01:43.937
Anyways...first attempt at
fixing dodgeball is in this bag.

01:44.003 --> 01:45.638
Because there's Codys
on every team.

01:45.705 --> 01:47.907
You throw a dodgeball in...

01:47.974 --> 01:49.976
bring it out covered in powder.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.444
Throw that at me, Ty.

01:52.712 --> 01:54.380
You think I've been hit?

01:54.447 --> 01:56.683
- TYLER: I mean, that's
a pretty good indicator.

01:56.749 --> 01:57.750
- Yes, I have.

01:57.817 --> 01:59.085

eternally out now?

You're back in!

08:02.381 --> 08:03.883
Well, Jack, your
hair looks silly.

08:03.950 --> 08:05.418

08:05.484 --> 08:06.686

08:06.752 --> 08:09.322
- We're all the same height.
Short.

08:09.388 --> 08:12.325
- Which is perfect
for trampoline dodgeball.

08:12.391 --> 08:14.794
- You would fit
perfectly on our team.

08:14.861 --> 08:17.129
- [laughs]

08:17.196 --> 08:18.731
- Okay, here's the rules.

08:18.798 --> 08:20.967
If you're gonna catch a ball,
it's away from the body.

Ball comes in,
you catch it on your body,

08:22.735 --> 08:24.770
you're out, you got stuck. Okay?

08:24.837 --> 08:26.672

that's a catch, other guy's out.

you're stuck, done-so.

trust really comes into play,

is not an option here.

shimmy up the outside
