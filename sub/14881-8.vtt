02:29.082 --> 02:32.018
Why do you always have to adjust yourself?

06:03.796 --> 06:05.031
Kendall.

06:06.232 --> 06:07.433
Mason.

08:36.749 --> 08:37.984
Pop bottles.

08:48.227 --> 08:49.395
<i>Dance with her.</i>

08:49.462 --> 08:52.765
<i>She probably will run away from you</i>
<i>because she's gonna be, you know, shy.</i>

08:53.332 --> 08:54.567
<i>Just hang out with them.</i>

21:26.184 --> 21:27.519
I don't have a friend Jennifer.

22:18.136 --> 22:20.405
-How old are you?
-Thirteen.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.581
Dude, that's the type of s***
you can't be doing.

22:29.648 --> 22:31.316
There are people watching you, you moron.

22:32.017 --> 22:33.785
You and I need to have, like, a code word.

22:35.354 --> 22:39.391
My point is it's awkward, and it's really
like, they're really conservative.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.427
Just give me a code word.

23:30.142 --> 23:32.277
-Where do you go to school?
-Columbia Prep.

23:32.344 --> 23:33.645
All right.

23:33.712 --> 23:36.681
I went to a school near there,
on the West Side,

23:36.748 --> 23:39.284
on Central Park West, called Rodef Shalom.

23:39.351 --> 23:42.687
-Of course, yeah!
-As a kid because I'm a Jew.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.145
-How old are you?
-Eleven.

24:08.647 --> 24:09.748
Thank you.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.094
Absolutely.

31:43.968 --> 31:48.072
<i>The strategy is I want him in the gym</i>
<i>in the next two months,</i>

31:48.139 --> 31:49.741
<i>I want him to be low-key.</i>

31:49.807 --> 31:53.678
<i>And right now, I want him to disappear</i>
<i>and just work on basketball.</i>

31:53.745 --> 31:56.681
<i>And he can reemerge this summer</i>
<i>once the season is over.</i>

31:56.748 --> 32:01.452
<i>Publicity for him right now will not be</i>
<i>a good thing for his sporting career.</i>

32:06.891 --> 32:08.459
<i>Exactly.</i>

32:09.727 --> 32:10.795
See you, bye-bye.

41:28.352 --> 41:29.720
You look great.
