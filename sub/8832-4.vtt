03:51.367 --> 03:52.400
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.800
>> ANYTHING BESIDES LET HER WALK

03:53.800 --> 03:55.067
AWAY WOULD BE AN IMPROVEMENT

03:55.067 --> 03:57.767
FROM WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

03:57.767 --> 03:59.167
>> THERE SHE GOES.

03:59.167 --> 04:00.700
OH. OH.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.133

04:08.533 --> 04:09.433
IT'S 1-1.

04:09.433 --> 04:10.467
IT ALL COMES DOWN TO THIS TURN,

04:10.467 --> 04:13.667
BOYS.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.600

04:28.800 --> 04:30.167
OH, OKAY.

04:30.167 --> 04:32.167
THAT'S MINE. THAT'S MINE.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.233
I GOT -- I GOT CONFUSED WITH

04:33.233 --> 04:35.967
CARTS.

04:35.967 --> 04:38.333
>> OH, THERE YOU GO, SAL!

04:38.333 --> 04:39.367

04:46.900 --> 04:48.567
>> YET ANOTHER FOOLPROOF PLAN

04:48.567 --> 04:49.400
GOES DOWN THE DRAIN.

04:53.067 --> 04:57.200
>> THIS SALAMI IS SO GOOD.

04:57.200 --> 04:59.233
THAT'S WHY I LOVE SHOOTING AT

04:59.233 --> 05:00.400
FAIRWAY.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.400
JUST EAT DELICIOUS COLD CUTS ALL

05:02.400 --> 05:03.400
DAY LONG.

05:03.400 --> 05:04.700
IT'S GOOD SALAMI.

05:04.700 --> 05:05.167
DAMN.

05:05.167 --> 05:06.267
>> I KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW, ON

05:06.267 --> 05:07.433
PURPOSE, YOU'RE SMACKING YOUR

05:07.433 --> 05:08.367
LIPS AND CHEWING WET.

05:08.367 --> 05:09.333
>> THAT IS HOW I CHEW.

05:09.333 --> 05:10.700
>> JOE, THEY'RE ALREADY...

05:10.700 --> 05:11.400
>> ALREADY.

05:11.400 --> 05:12.633
>> ALREADY AT EACH OTHER'S

05:12.633 --> 05:13.367
THROATS.

05:13.367 --> 05:14.500
>> HE SHOVED SALAMI IN HIS

05:14.500 --> 05:15.800
MOUTH, LOOKED AT ME, AND STARTS

05:15.800 --> 05:17.067
SLAPPING HIS WET LIPS, AND HE,

05:17.067 --> 05:18.333
LIKE, SMIRKED A LITTLE, AND HE

05:18.333 --> 05:19.300
WAS TRYING TO BAIT ME.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.600
>> HE EATS LIKE A NURSING BABY

05:20.600 --> 05:21.867
IF YOU TAKE THE TEAT AWAY.

05:23.533 --> 05:26.333
"BA-BA, SALAMI."

05:26.333 --> 05:27.433
I JUST REALIZED PEOPLE COULD SEE

05:27.433 --> 05:27.833
ME.

05:27.833 --> 05:30.567
>>

05:30.567 --> 05:31.700
ALL RIGHT, SO, HERE WE GO.

05:31.700 --> 05:32.933
JOE'S GOING TO BE GUESSING THE

05:32.933 --> 05:33.433
ITEM.

05:33.433 --> 05:34.633
Q IS GONNA BE SELECTING THE

05:34.633 --> 05:35.067
ITEM.

05:35.067 --> 05:36.533
>> YES.

05:37.800 --> 05:39.733
>> EXCELLENT CHOICE.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.800
THE EAGLE HAS LANDED.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.867
HERE COMES JOE.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.200
>> HERE COMES JOEY.

05:47.200 --> 05:47.533
>> OH.

05:47.533 --> 05:50.667
JOE'S WALKING WITH A BRISK PACE.

05:50.667 --> 05:51.967
>> JOE IS LOOKING.

05:51.967 --> 05:53.200
OH!

05:53.200 --> 05:57.300
OH, PERFECT OPPORTUNITY.

05:57.300 --> 05:58.400
>> WHAT'D HE GRAB, WHAT'D HE

05:58.400 --> 05:58.933
GRAB?

05:58.933 --> 06:00.067
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE IF IT

06:00.067 --> 06:00.567
IS.

06:00.567 --> 06:03.300
LET'S SEE IF IT IS.

06:03.300 --> 06:03.900
>> NOPE.

06:03.900 --> 06:08.067
>>

06:08.067 --> 06:09.067
>> OH, THE GUY'S DISTRACTED WITH

06:09.067 --> 06:09.533
HIS CHILD.

06:09.533 --> 06:11.800
THIS IS GOOD FOR JOE.

06:15.133 --> 06:17.067
>> HE'S DISTRACTED BY HIS KID.

06:17.067 --> 06:18.967
THE GUY'S LITERALLY WALKING AWAY

06:18.967 --> 06:21.167
FROM HIS CART!

06:21.167 --> 06:22.800
OH, YOU COULDN'T GET IT EASIER.

06:22.800 --> 06:24.367
YOU COULD NOT GET IT EASIER.

06:24.367 --> 06:25.667
>> OH, DUDE!

06:27.700 --> 06:31.533
>> UH, NO, NO, AND NO.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.333
>> NO ONE SAID YOU COULD TAKE

06:35.333 --> 06:36.233
MULTIPLE ITEMS!

06:36.233 --> 06:37.567
NO ONE SAID YOU COULDN'T.

06:37.567 --> 06:38.967
>> YEAH, WE DIDN'T SAY YOU

06:38.967 --> 06:40.100
COULDN'T.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.133
>> OH, HE'S BACK, HE'S BACK,

06:41.133 --> 06:41.567
HE'S BACK!

06:41.567 --> 06:45.433
>> HE'S COMING BACK.

06:45.433 --> 06:47.367
>> OH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.

06:47.367 --> 06:49.067
OH, THIS IS YOUR CART?

06:49.067 --> 06:50.533
I THINK I ACCIDENTALLY PUT THIS

06:50.533 --> 06:51.167
ONE IN.

06:51.167 --> 06:51.933
I'M SORRY.

06:51.933 --> 06:53.367
THE WRONG ONE, BECAUSE THAT'S

06:53.367 --> 06:55.067
JUST A BAD CHOICE.

06:55.067 --> 06:58.067
BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW NUGGET SAYS

06:58.067 --> 07:00.067
YOU LOSE.

07:00.067 --> 07:01.500
>> OH!

07:04.433 --> 07:05.067
AMAZING!

07:05.067 --> 07:05.633
>> NICE!

07:05.633 --> 07:07.133
>> THERE WAS ANOTHER HONEY.

07:07.133 --> 07:07.967
>> HOLY GEEZ.

07:07.967 --> 07:09.167
>> HE HAD TWO HONEYS.

07:09.167 --> 07:09.900
>> WOW.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.167
ALL RIGHT, SO THAT'S ONE LOSS

07:11.167 --> 07:12.067
FOR Q RIGHT NOW.

07:12.067 --> 07:13.100
BEST TWO OUT OF THREE.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.067
>> HERE WE GO.

07:14.067 --> 07:16.767
GENTLEMEN, TODAY, JOE GATTO WILL

07:16.767 --> 07:20.100
BE GOING FOR SUPPOSITORIES.

07:20.133 --> 07:21.300
>> SO JOE COULD TAKE THIS WIN OR

07:21.300 --> 07:22.567
LOSS AND SHOVE IT UP HIS ASS.

07:28.267 --> 07:29.800
>> HE'S PUTTING IT UNDERNEATH,

07:29.800 --> 07:30.833
ON THE PAPER TOWELS.

07:30.833 --> 07:31.700
EXCELLENT MOVE.

07:31.700 --> 07:32.767
>> GUYS, IT'S IN.

07:32.767 --> 07:35.833
>> YOU'RE IN, JOE.

07:35.833 --> 07:37.767
>> Q DOES NOT WANT TO LOSE.

07:40.167 --> 07:42.067
>> OH, MAN.

07:42.067 --> 07:43.567
OH.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.267
IT'S ON THE

07:48.267 --> 07:49.267
>> IT'S ON THE FLOOR.

07:49.267 --> 07:50.600
JOE PULLED OUT THE PAPER TOWELS.

07:50.600 --> 07:51.600
IT'S ON THE FLOOR, THE

07:51.600 --> 07:52.300
SUPPOSITORIES.

07:52.300 --> 07:53.067
LOOK!
