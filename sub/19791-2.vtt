WEBVTT

00:03.552 --> 00:06.105
- You want some more sprinkles?
- Yes, please.

00:06.477 --> 00:08.431
Okay, I'm not really
sure if I'm the best dad

00:08.462 --> 00:10.010
or the worst dad in the
world for getting you up

00:10.028 --> 00:11.933
in the middle of the night
to eat ice cream with me.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.229
The best.

00:14.765 --> 00:17.335
Oh, what do you know? You're
all hopped up on sugar.

00:18.669 --> 00:21.089
With all the depraved crazies I
have to put up with at the bar,

00:21.126 --> 00:23.497
I love comin' home to
someone so pure and innocent.

00:23.534 --> 00:26.728
And this is where the magic happens.

00:28.191 --> 00:30.667
Um... before any magic happens,

00:30.685 --> 00:33.014
let's remember the rule: no
magic in front of the baby.

00:33.063 --> 00:35.281
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Hey. Hey, man.

00:35.300 --> 00:37.141
Ha-ha. This is...

00:37.846 --> 00:39.274
Kiki.

00:39.921 --> 00:42.391
Kiki? Yes. Kiki. Kiki.

00:42.415 --> 00:43.836
It's Kiki.

00:43.866 --> 00:45.579
That's my roommate and his kid.

00:45.614 --> 00:47.595
You don't really need to talk to
them, just... just make your way down

00:47.624 --> 00:50.160
to the end of the hall.
I'll grab us some wine.

00:50.702 --> 00:53.301
Pay no attention to the self-help
books and the vision board,

00:53.324 --> 00:55.072
I... I'm holdin' those for a friend.

00:55.573 --> 00:57.362
Please take this as a huge compliment,

00:57.368 --> 00:59.955
- but she is way out of your league.
- I know, right?

01:01.831 --> 01:04.099
So I just decided to
grab, like a quick drink

01:04.111 --> 01:06.109
down at the Belvedere, you know, and

01:06.138 --> 01:08.549
there she was, just sittin' there alone,

01:08.563 --> 01:10.241
at the end of the bar, man.

01:10.264 --> 01:11.656
- The Belvedere?
- Yeah.

01:11.989 --> 01:14.022
You met her sitting
alone at the Belvedere?

01:14.069 --> 01:15.992
Yep.

01:16.050 --> 01:18.986
And now she's here.
In my house, in my bed.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.182
Why am I still talkin' to you?

01:25.379 --> 01:28.065
Okay. Eat up, Daddy will be right back.

01:32.121 --> 01:34.184
Danny. Danny. Danny. Danny.

01:36.317 --> 01:38.251
Dude, what is wrong with you?

01:38.916 --> 01:41.351
Remember when you told me to wake
you up no matter what time it was,

01:41.381 --> 01:42.633
if A, there was an apocalypse,

01:42.657 --> 01:44.649
B, if beer were suddenly
free around the world,

01:44.667 --> 01:46.648
or C, if I ever met a real live hooker?

01:46.665 --> 01:48.186
Well, one of those things just happened.

01:49.002 --> 01:50.570
B. Wait, no, A.

01:50.575 --> 01:53.051
It's C. A hooker. Tucker
just brought home a hooker.

01:53.086 --> 01:55.137
What? No way.

01:55.149 --> 01:57.946
He met her at the Belvedere,
AKA, hooker hangout.

01:57.957 --> 02:01.509
- Oh. Oh my God, I wanna see her.
- What? No.

02:01.629 --> 02:03.540
But if you hold me out
over the fire escape,

02:03.570 --> 02:04.980
I think I could see her.

02:19.111 --> 02:21.140
So, where's the new girlfriend?

02:21.169 --> 02:22.428
Didn't spend the night, huh?

02:22.457 --> 02:24.513
No, she had to be up early.

02:24.536 --> 02:28.184
So you say she stayed... I
don't know... about an hour.

02:29.594 --> 02:32.187
Yeah... something like that.

02:33.032 --> 02:35.438
Okay, seriously, please, please tell me

02:35.456 --> 02:38.788
what's makin' you two smile
like weird home-schooled kids?

02:39.744 --> 02:42.815
Dude, it's okay, we've
all paid for it before.

02:42.832 --> 02:45.081
- Really? You've paid for it?
- No, I've never paid for it.

02:45.110 --> 02:46.217
That's what you say to a friend,

02:46.223 --> 02:47.779
so he doesn't feel bad
when he pays for it.

02:47.791 --> 02:49.457
Um, hi. Uh, I'm sorry.

02:49.469 --> 02:52.044
You guys think Kiki's a prostitute?

02:52.050 --> 02:53.367
Pretty much.

02:53.414 --> 02:56.467
I mean, look where you met
her, look how you met her,

02:56.508 --> 02:58.402
and if that doesn't
convince you, look at her.

02:58.437 --> 03:01.625
Oh, and don't forget her name... Kiki.

03:03.304 --> 03:05.955
Oh, I see what's goin' on
here, you're just jealous.

03:06.007 --> 03:08.251
- Me? How am I jealous?
- Yeah, you're jealous

03:08.268 --> 03:11.053
because I found a smart,
attractive girl who likes me.

03:11.082 --> 03:13.104
Tucker, pretending to
like you is her job.

03:13.127 --> 03:16.018
- I didn't pay for it.
- I hear the first time's usually free.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.459
That's drugs. What... ?

03:18.744 --> 03:22.003
And besides, man, at least
I'm not the one chasin' around

03:22.049 --> 03:24.298
some fantasy chick he's never even met

03:24.316 --> 03:27.237
because he can't have a
relationship with a real girl.

03:28.724 --> 03:32.150
I might not have a girlfriend,
but at least I have a job.

03:34.284 --> 03:36.229
Oh, you did not just go there.

03:36.451 --> 03:38.753
Oh, I went there. I'm livin' there.

03:38.788 --> 03:40.422
I'm gonna build a house
and raise a family there.

03:40.457 --> 03:41.946
You know what?

03:43.315 --> 03:45.151
Hey, Tuck.

03:45.611 --> 03:47.295
- Ben.
- I know.

03:47.307 --> 03:49.306
- You know what you gotta do?
- Yeah,

03:49.848 --> 03:52.260
prove that girl really is a prostitute.

03:53.158 --> 03:56.095
- Adios. Sayonara.
- Arrivederci.

03:56.124 --> 03:58.047
And, uh, buh-bye.

03:58.234 --> 04:01.101
Last stop on our goodbye
tour before we head off

04:01.130 --> 04:03.210
on our lust-filled
trip around the world.

04:03.239 --> 04:07.085
I learned how to scream
"Oh, God" in five languages.

04:07.959 --> 04:09.760
Grandma.

04:09.807 --> 04:13.133
Oh... Emma. Mmm.

04:13.180 --> 04:15.668
Oh, Grandma's gonna miss you so much.

04:15.703 --> 04:17.346
It's not gonna be the
same without you, Mom.

04:17.392 --> 04:20.324
Oh, honey. Oh, this...

04:20.608 --> 04:23.156
this is the memory I will take with me.

04:29.269 --> 04:31.320
Let's be honest, I could use a break.

04:32.602 --> 04:34.100
Right there with ya.

04:34.764 --> 04:37.311
Well, Bon-Bon, we better get goin'.
Our flight leaves in two hours

04:37.323 --> 04:39.644
- and we still need to get our shots.
- Oh, you're getting vaccinated?

04:39.655 --> 04:41.293
No, we're gettin' wasted.

04:41.316 --> 04:43.810
Boink.

04:44.206 --> 04:46.864
- This vacation starts now.
- Bye.

04:48.933 --> 04:50.541
Hi, Riles. Bye, Riles.

04:50.570 --> 04:52.861
Bye, Mrs. Wheeler.
I'm really gonna mi...

04:52.981 --> 04:55.366
I'm really gonna mi...

04:55.383 --> 04:58.217
Oh, damn it, I could do it this morning.

04:59.603 --> 05:03.093
Oh, my God. Okay, you
know, it's medicinal.

05:03.367 --> 05:04.993
I have a license, yeah.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.945
I'm holding it for a friend,
his name is Ben Wheeler,

05:06.962 --> 05:08.301
he lives right there.

05:08.334 --> 05:09.504
We aren't here for you, ma'am.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.038
Brad Walker, you're under arrest.

05:11.057 --> 05:12.852
What? No, no. There must
be some kind of a mistake.

05:12.861 --> 05:14.600
What are you doing? I
mean, what are the charges?

05:14.624 --> 05:16.180
Are you sure you're not here for her?

05:16.744 --> 05:19.587
- I am. Real estate fraud.
- That could still be her.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.354
- Honey, what are they talking about?
- Listen to me, Bonnie,

05:22.371 --> 05:25.227
everything is gonna be okay. There
is a perfectly logical explanation,

05:25.274 --> 05:27.156
which I am currently working on.

05:27.220 --> 05:30.267
Just stay calm, and
find me a great lawyer.

05:33.763 --> 05:37.044
No. No, no, no, definitely
not. I'm... I'm busy.

05:37.073 --> 05:40.313
I'm pregnant. Conflict of
interest, not my specialty.

05:40.336 --> 05:42.387
Please stop me when you
hear one of those you like.

05:43.541 --> 05:45.971
Listen, if you don't help Brad,

05:45.989 --> 05:48.453
I will make every day of
your life a living hell.

05:48.470 --> 05:50.742
Yeah, that's right,
nothing's gonna change.

05:52.887 --> 05:54.950
- Race you to the courthouse.
- Okay.

06:10.475 --> 06:12.351
Danny. It's her.

06:12.375 --> 06:14.033
Tucker's hooker is here.
She's sitting at the bar.

06:14.061 --> 06:16.112
- Really? Oh, my God, I want to see her.
- No, no, no, no. no.

06:16.140 --> 06:17.841
You're not just gonna see her,

06:17.961 --> 06:19.794
- you're gonna pick her up.
- Okay.

06:20.871 --> 06:22.092
And where should I put her?

06:22.945 --> 06:24.720
You're gonna proposition her, Danny.

06:24.840 --> 06:26.407
Bring her home, and I'll
make sure Tucker is there.

06:26.431 --> 06:27.890
We gotta prove to him
that she's a hooker.

06:28.010 --> 06:29.358
What if she doesn't agree?

06:29.478 --> 06:31.120
I don't feel very attractive today.

06:31.157 --> 06:32.616
Dude, she's a hooker.

06:32.789 --> 06:34.607
It's literally her job to agree.

06:35.432 --> 06:36.933
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:36.998 --> 06:38.565
Thanks for meetin' me
here. You ready to go?

06:38.565 --> 06:41.381
- Yeah. Let's go.
- You look great.

06:44.587 --> 06:46.825
Okay. So she's the hot one
sitting in the middle of the bar.

06:46.848 --> 06:48.744
I'll find Tucker and meet you at home.

07:00.996 --> 07:02.678
Boy, am I lonely.

07:04.152 --> 07:06.035
If only I could have sex with someone.

07:11.783 --> 07:13.279
This can't be happening.

07:13.615 --> 07:15.549
I don't know how much longer I can stand

07:15.558 --> 07:17.908
to see you rotting away like this.

07:17.950 --> 07:19.912
Bonnie, it's only been two hours.

07:20.826 --> 07:22.299
But I'm scared.

07:22.490 --> 07:24.275
Three prison gangs want me

07:24.299 --> 07:26.345
and I don't wanna
hurt anyone's feelings.

07:27.236 --> 07:29.343
Listen. All right, don't worry.

07:29.385 --> 07:31.198
Riley is gonna get you out of here.

07:31.272 --> 07:35.747
In the meantime, let me take
you to cellblock double-D.

07:37.808 --> 07:39.299
Oh, my God. Mrs. Wheeler,

07:39.351 --> 07:42.469
- put those away.
- No. This is how I grieve.

07:45.811 --> 07:48.846
Okay. Hi. All right. I
looked through the charges,

07:48.850 --> 07:51.089
and I think I have a clear
strategy for getting you out.

07:51.107 --> 07:53.303
So your guilt or
innocence doesn't matter.

07:53.345 --> 07:55.896
- In fact, it's actually better if I don't know...
- I'm guilty.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.964
Is the kind of statement
that I don't need to know.

07:58.598 --> 08:01.358
I did it all. There is a
storage locker in Brooklyn

08:01.377 --> 08:03.321
with all the evidence
they need against me.

08:03.358 --> 08:04.823
And I did not hear that.

08:06.193 --> 08:08.780
- I said I'm guilty.
- Brad, stop.

08:08.818 --> 08:10.410
I can't hear any of this.

08:10.463 --> 08:11.596
There's something wrong with my phone.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.563
Would someone please tell
my lawyer that I'm guilty?

08:22.377 --> 08:24.731
Wait. I've actually been here before.

08:24.778 --> 08:25.925
I know.

08:26.088 --> 08:27.142
That's kind of the point.

08:28.535 --> 08:30.088
Could you just wait here for one second?

08:31.253 --> 08:32.158
Hey.

08:32.456 --> 08:33.881
I got the hooker. Where's Tucker?

08:33.919 --> 08:35.910
I don't know. He hasn't
answered any of my texts.

08:35.938 --> 08:37.836
Normally, at this time of
day, he's sitting on the couch,

08:37.864 --> 08:39.140
wondering where his life went wrong.

08:40.623 --> 08:42.636
- Ben?
- Rachel?

08:42.645 --> 08:45.458
Rachel. Hey. So great to see you.

08:45.578 --> 08:47.653
Sorry I never called you back, I, uh...

08:47.844 --> 08:49.080
broke my hand.

08:50.352 --> 08:51.541
What are you doin' here?

08:51.620 --> 08:54.049
- I thought your name was Kiki.
- Nope. Rachel.

08:54.169 --> 08:56.595
Well done, Danny, you
brought home the wrong girl.

08:56.618 --> 08:58.744
- You're not a hooker?
- No, I'm not a hooker.

08:58.753 --> 09:00.189
Then why'd you come back
with me when I asked you

09:00.203 --> 09:01.480
if you wanted to have sex?

09:01.513 --> 09:03.499
I thought I was hooking
up with a New York Ranger.

09:05.013 --> 09:06.831
I thought I was hooking
up with a New York Ranger.

09:06.859 --> 09:09.562
Riley. Uh, it's not what it looks like.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.469
See, I thought Rachel
was Tucker's hooker,

09:11.488 --> 09:13.054
so I tried to make her my hooker.

09:15.049 --> 09:18.233
It's just your classic case
of mistaken hooker identity.

09:19.660 --> 09:20.989
Ah, relax.

09:21.109 --> 09:23.263
The fact that Ben is here
automatically clears everybody.

09:24.806 --> 09:26.666
So, Rachel, how's your cat?

09:26.699 --> 09:28.736
- She died.
- Bummer.

09:29.622 --> 09:31.780
- What's goin' on?
- Okay, well, big picture:

09:31.785 --> 09:34.167
Brad's been arrested
and my life may be over.

09:34.204 --> 09:36.171
And small picture:
Danny hired this hooker

09:36.185 --> 09:37.420
to prove that you were dating one.

09:37.540 --> 09:39.658
Yeah. I think that's
everything, right? Yeah.

09:39.686 --> 09:42.114
- I'm not a hooker.
- Okay, whatever you say, sweetie.

09:44.399 --> 09:46.040
Ben, can I talk to you?

09:46.077 --> 09:48.017
I'd rather not, you seem pretty pissed.

09:49.611 --> 09:51.228
Did he pick you up at the Belvedere?

09:51.872 --> 09:53.377
Tell Jimmy I said hi.

09:58.165 --> 10:01.209
- I'm tellin' you, I'm right.
- Dude, you are being ridiculous.

10:01.247 --> 10:04.150
Kiki is not a hooker, man.
You wanna know how I know?

10:04.173 --> 10:05.432
I'm not paying her.

10:05.493 --> 10:07.128
That doesn't mean other people aren't.

10:08.144 --> 10:09.660
Come on, man, what do
you even know about her?

10:09.688 --> 10:11.460
- What does she do for a living?
- No idea.

10:11.482 --> 10:13.613
- Are you seeing her again tonight?
- Nope, she's working.

10:13.636 --> 10:15.095
- At what?
- No idea.

10:15.137 --> 10:16.498
- Exactly.
- Okay...

10:16.618 --> 10:19.179
This does not prove
that she's a hooker, man.

10:19.235 --> 10:21.473
It... It just proves
that I'm a bad listener.

10:22.559 --> 10:25.245
And what does any girl
you've ever dated do?

10:28.891 --> 10:30.579
Riley's like a judge or something?

10:31.991 --> 10:34.750
Exactly. And we're done
with this conversation.

10:34.783 --> 10:36.279
- Tucker...
- I said done.

10:38.256 --> 10:39.915
- Tucker still mad?
- Yup.

10:39.953 --> 10:41.202
Should we apologize?

10:41.253 --> 10:43.117
Nope. We're goin' to the Belvedere.

10:43.152 --> 10:44.106
Why?

10:44.181 --> 10:46.796
Because friendship isn't just
about what you say to your friends.

10:46.819 --> 10:48.502
It's what you do behind their backs.

10:51.075 --> 10:52.744
Tucker's lucky to have us.

10:58.738 --> 11:01.130
Mrs. Wheeler. Mrs. Wheeler, great news.

11:01.172 --> 11:03.367
- What?
- All the evidence against Brad is circumstantial.

11:03.395 --> 11:05.666
After a preliminary conversation
with the DA's office,

11:05.698 --> 11:07.572
it looks like I may be
able to cut him a deal.

11:07.964 --> 11:10.994
Quit the legal mumbo jumbo, you
showoff, and give it to me straight.

11:11.936 --> 11:14.663
I think I'll be able to get Brad out.

11:14.691 --> 11:17.520
Okay, I mean, except for
an indecent exposure case

11:17.525 --> 11:19.967
that you are a part of,
his record is squeaky clean.

11:20.087 --> 11:21.496
I mean, he'll just have to pay a fine,

11:21.510 --> 11:23.897
- he won't even lose his real estate license.
- Oh, my God.

11:23.934 --> 11:27.550
You did it. I mean,
you. You actually did it.

11:27.573 --> 11:30.574
God, I... I knew I was
smart to pick you, huh?

11:31.325 --> 11:33.557
Yep, it's all you.

11:33.790 --> 11:35.410
It always is.

11:36.034 --> 11:38.504
Oh, I'm gonna convince
Brad to take the deal.

11:39.728 --> 11:41.453
Phew!

11:44.331 --> 11:46.977
Always waitin' on the men, am I right?

11:47.455 --> 11:49.256
- Well, it is a men's prison.
- Ah.

11:49.291 --> 11:52.373
- What's yours in for?
- Real estate fraud.

11:52.542 --> 11:54.721
Guilty as sin.

11:54.841 --> 11:56.376
But when you've got an ass like that,

11:56.399 --> 11:57.955
you're bound to make a few mistakes.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.925
Think you'll be able to get him off?

12:04.411 --> 12:06.322
Oh, for the fraud and stuff, right.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.054
Yeah, we're already working on it.

12:08.257 --> 12:09.522
Okay. Brad's on board.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.147
Now I just need to
talk to the assistant DA

12:11.194 --> 12:13.175
- and get this thing finalized.
- No need.

12:13.187 --> 12:14.923
I'm the assistant DA.

12:14.982 --> 12:16.631
And the deal's off the table.

12:17.453 --> 12:19.533
Better luck next time, Counselor.

12:20.610 --> 12:21.880
I'm sorry...

12:21.910 --> 12:25.534
Way to go, Riley. I knew I
shouldn't have picked you.

12:25.598 --> 12:28.499
But no, you're family,
it would've been awkward.

12:28.529 --> 12:30.224
God, thanks a lot.

12:30.344 --> 12:31.925
Danny?

12:32.182 --> 12:34.174
- Riley?
- What are you doing here?

12:34.238 --> 12:37.548
Um... I... uh, we...

12:37.980 --> 12:40.077
- Ben?
- We were just payin' some parking tickets.

12:41.126 --> 12:42.594
You don't have a car.

12:43.836 --> 12:45.520
We just signed up for a ride-along.

12:45.782 --> 12:48.378
- Danny's afraid of sirens.
- You said you wouldn't tell anyone.

12:50.056 --> 12:52.276
Okay, fine, the truth is,

12:52.317 --> 12:54.286
we came to see Brad,
and support you and Mom.

12:54.406 --> 12:55.708
Well, that's an obvious lie,

12:55.714 --> 12:57.875
but whatever you're doing,
I'm sure it's Ben's fault.

12:57.995 --> 13:00.369
Come on, Mrs. Wheeler,
we need a whole new plan.

13:00.963 --> 13:03.003
Soliciting a prostitute?

13:03.050 --> 13:04.996
Well done, boys, you owe me bail money.

13:05.066 --> 13:07.259
We were just trying to
get information, not sex.

13:07.282 --> 13:08.943
Though I feel like you
were maybe considering it.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.546
Is it a crime to ask what's on the menu?

13:10.581 --> 13:12.119
Well, we're in jail, so
I'm gonna go with yes.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.880
How were we supposed to know
she was an undercover cop?

13:13.909 --> 13:16.466
Oh, my God. You are never
gonna give up on this, are you?

13:16.507 --> 13:17.904
No. Never. Not happening.

13:17.910 --> 13:19.623
Zero chance in hell. You know why?

13:19.647 --> 13:21.808
- Because I'm right.
- Okay, you know what? I'll play.

13:21.837 --> 13:24.990
I'm gonna prove to you both
that Kiki is not a prostitute.

13:25.928 --> 13:27.752
I don't suppose that means you
want me to have sex with her

13:27.763 --> 13:28.975
and see if she charges me?

13:29.954 --> 13:31.493
Just throwin' it out there.

13:39.062 --> 13:41.830
- What's wrong with you?
- I can't do it again.

13:41.859 --> 13:43.305
The first time I got the wrong girl,

13:43.333 --> 13:44.550
the second time we got arrested.

13:44.592 --> 13:47.319
Let's face it, I'm no good
at pickin' up prostitutes.

13:50.009 --> 13:51.258
Look, you will be fine.

13:51.295 --> 13:53.229
Okay? As soon as you
sit down, I'll text her

13:53.276 --> 13:56.632
that I have to cancel, at which
point she will undoubtedly get up

13:56.650 --> 14:00.058
- and walk out of the bar.
- Yeah, with Danny and his cold hard cash.

14:00.094 --> 14:02.447
Now you get out there
and pick up a pro, bro.

14:08.260 --> 14:11.057
Okay, you've burnt down a house,
a forest, and a summer camp.

14:11.087 --> 14:12.759
What's one lousy little storage locker?

14:13.994 --> 14:15.823
Mrs. Wheeler, what are you doing?

14:15.842 --> 14:17.834
No evidence, no conviction.

14:17.840 --> 14:20.113
- Oh...
- You can't do that.

14:20.113 --> 14:22.653
It's arson. It will ruin your life.

14:22.886 --> 14:24.967
Also, can't you ever
just shred something?

14:24.985 --> 14:26.587
Why is burning always your go-to?

14:27.613 --> 14:30.031
- But I love him.
- I know.

14:30.151 --> 14:32.557
Please don't hate me
for saying this, but...

14:32.834 --> 14:34.500
are you sure he's worth it?

14:34.693 --> 14:36.406
It shouldn't be this hard.

14:36.838 --> 14:38.795
Neither is choosing
between Ben and Danny,

14:38.836 --> 14:41.592
but Lord knows that decision
baffled you for 20 years.

14:42.157 --> 14:45.396
I'm just saying maybe it's
time you do what you do best,

14:45.589 --> 14:47.151
only think about yourself.

14:47.710 --> 14:49.709
Do you really think I
should just walk away?

14:49.715 --> 14:51.970
Mrs. Wheeler, I know you thought
you would never find love again

14:51.981 --> 14:53.810
after everything that
happened with your ex-husband,

14:53.828 --> 14:58.373
but you are a vibrant woman with
a lot of mi... life left in you.

14:58.868 --> 15:01.787
You shouldn't have to
rot away alongside Brad.

15:02.905 --> 15:05.999
Well, it seems pretty
dicey to trust somebody

15:06.034 --> 15:08.156
who'd make the choice to cut
their hair like that, but...

15:08.453 --> 15:10.831
you might be right.

15:11.379 --> 15:14.053
Maybe there just is
no happy ending for us.

15:14.083 --> 15:16.780
But it's not too late for
you to have your happy ending.

15:18.826 --> 15:20.417
Do you smell smoke?

15:20.621 --> 15:21.897
No.

15:22.649 --> 15:25.067
Oh, God. Okay, all right, run.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.561
Run, this is like Camp
Winnataki all over again.

15:27.681 --> 15:31.074
Go! Go, go, go, go, go.

15:31.546 --> 15:32.781
Amateur.

15:35.462 --> 15:36.744
You're welcome!

15:38.504 --> 15:39.861
Hello, there.

15:40.316 --> 15:42.519
I'm a businessman from out of town.

15:43.655 --> 15:45.607
- How are you?
- Uninterested.

15:46.725 --> 15:47.897
Really?

15:48.444 --> 15:52.576
Because, working in business
as I do can get very lonely.

15:53.275 --> 15:55.629
The only thing keeping
me company right now

15:55.647 --> 15:58.013
is my pocket full of cold hard cash.

16:04.702 --> 16:07.807
Well, maybe we can be lonely together.

16:08.100 --> 16:10.069
Seems my night just opened up.

16:11.025 --> 16:13.472
Why's she still talking
to him, what is he saying?

16:13.592 --> 16:14.999
Well, if he's been paying attention,

16:14.999 --> 16:16.764
hopefully it's about
having sex for money.

16:18.361 --> 16:20.238
So, you think you wanna have some fun?

16:20.459 --> 16:22.604
And... you know what I mean by "fun?"

16:22.773 --> 16:24.002
I know.

16:24.122 --> 16:25.727
So are you staying nearby?

16:25.914 --> 16:27.400
Just so we're clear,

16:27.520 --> 16:29.031
you only wanna have sex with me

16:29.066 --> 16:31.281
because I'm going to pay you. Right?

16:31.401 --> 16:33.839
Yes. It's 500 for the hour.

16:33.959 --> 16:36.607
Oh, my God. You are a hooker. Guys.

16:36.727 --> 16:39.578
She is a real hooker!
I can't believe it.

16:39.607 --> 16:42.153
I mean, honestly, I didn't think
so, but Ben was so sure of it

16:42.194 --> 16:44.379
and Tucker refused to believe it, wow.

16:44.432 --> 16:47.578
A real life hooker, it
is so nice to meet you.

16:48.155 --> 16:50.043
Tucker, what the hell is going on?

16:50.049 --> 16:51.302
Kiki, I am so sorry.

16:51.313 --> 16:54.233
Okay, these idiots are
convinced that you're a hooker,

16:54.268 --> 16:57.199
and I'm just tryin' to prove to
them that you could never do that.

16:57.222 --> 17:00.596
Why not? It's a business,
just like everything else.

17:01.621 --> 17:04.185
- Wait, so you are a hooker?
- Yes.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.954
But I wasn't when I was with you.

17:06.241 --> 17:07.452
I really liked you.

17:07.465 --> 17:09.746
I was hoping that we could
have a real relationship.

17:10.212 --> 17:12.371
Something I don't get very often.

17:14.086 --> 17:15.419
Bye, Tucker.

17:17.163 --> 17:18.188
Yes.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.682
What did I say? I told you guys,

17:20.710 --> 17:23.785
but no, nobody believed
me. I was being ridiculous.

17:23.786 --> 17:26.348
Well, who's ridiculous now?

17:27.819 --> 17:29.485
Congratulations, Ben.

17:31.183 --> 17:33.316
You know, just tell me one thing.

17:34.124 --> 17:37.068
Were you doing this because you
wanted to be a good friend, or...

17:37.704 --> 17:39.761
just because you wanted to be right?

17:42.432 --> 17:45.693
Oh, I get it, you're just
tryin' to make me feel bad.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.896
Oh, crap, now I feel bad.

17:55.011 --> 17:56.800
I burned most of the evidence.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.792
Not my usual breakup gift,

17:58.839 --> 18:01.100
but the conjugal visit trailer
was booked up for weeks.

18:02.058 --> 18:05.212
- You sure you're ready to do this?
- I am.

18:05.332 --> 18:06.738
Game face, Bonnie.

18:06.785 --> 18:08.562
Stay strong. Stay strong.

18:12.705 --> 18:14.744
- Brad, we need to talk.
- Bonnie, they're gonna keep me

18:14.763 --> 18:17.319
- in this cage for years.
- Yeah, that's what I wanted to talk to you about.

18:17.352 --> 18:20.283
The pain and suffering is
going to be immeasurable.

18:20.339 --> 18:22.139
Well, at least for one of us.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.451
You have to let me go.

18:25.160 --> 18:27.365
I can't let my choices
affect the woman that I love

18:27.365 --> 18:29.206
more than I ever loved myself.

18:30.316 --> 18:32.242
Wait. What?

18:32.848 --> 18:36.181
You love me more than you love yourself?

18:37.109 --> 18:39.725
But you love you so much.

18:40.321 --> 18:41.501
I know.

18:43.169 --> 18:47.052
And that is why I am
setting you free, Bon-Bon.

18:48.155 --> 18:49.997
Well, there you go,
you wanna share a cab?

18:50.818 --> 18:52.730
No. No, I'm not going anywhere.

18:53.042 --> 18:56.697
You are my husband, and I love
you, and I will wait for you.

18:56.744 --> 18:58.417
Even if it takes forever.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.946
Because I love you more
than you love you, too.

19:07.298 --> 19:09.694
That's why you're gonna be
the pride of the family...

19:10.412 --> 19:11.880
the bar is low.

19:15.609 --> 19:18.657
Kiki, hey. Thank you so much for coming.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.234
You know, I feel terrible
about how everything went down

19:21.248 --> 19:23.616
between you and Tucker, and
I have a proposition for you.

19:23.667 --> 19:25.257
Not for all the money in the world.

19:25.289 --> 19:27.019
No. No, no, no, no, no, not me.

19:27.047 --> 19:29.033
Although, that sort
of hurts my feelings.

19:29.999 --> 19:30.964
Listen.

19:31.084 --> 19:33.537
I didn't realize how much
Tucker really liked you. So,

19:33.602 --> 19:35.537
do you think you would
consider calling him and saying

19:35.556 --> 19:36.802
you were just pretending to be a hooker

19:36.820 --> 19:37.861
because you knew what we were up to,

19:37.891 --> 19:39.092
and were just messin' with us?

19:39.431 --> 19:41.169
I don't think I'm comfortable lying.

19:41.325 --> 19:42.608
Oh, but you're comfortable with...

19:42.659 --> 19:44.095
Never mind, never mind.

19:44.123 --> 19:45.414
I'll admit to him I was wrong,

19:45.423 --> 19:47.498
and then maybe you guys could
go out a couple more times,

19:47.522 --> 19:49.237
and just break up normally?

19:49.357 --> 19:51.512
I mean, he never makes it
past three dates anyway.

19:52.715 --> 19:54.183
I guess I would be up for that.

19:54.258 --> 19:56.294
Really? That's awesome.

19:56.518 --> 19:59.553
Wow. Look at that. A
hooker with a heart of gold.

19:59.589 --> 20:02.704
Those don't exist. It's
gonna cost you $500.

20:02.909 --> 20:04.057
Huh.

20:05.580 --> 20:07.440
Cash... best friend.

20:07.514 --> 20:09.912
Cash... best friend.

20:10.251 --> 20:12.032
Ca... This might take a while.

20:16.655 --> 20:18.198
Well, here we are again,

20:18.221 --> 20:20.650
Bad Dad waking you up in the
middle of the night for a snack.

20:22.762 --> 20:23.615
Welcome.

20:25.046 --> 20:26.067
Really?

20:27.111 --> 20:29.377
Okay, this is Natalia,
she's a librarian,

20:29.405 --> 20:31.346
she lives in Brooklyn,
originally from Yonkers,

20:31.368 --> 20:33.410
she has a sister named Jody
and a cat named Sprinkle.

20:33.410 --> 20:34.779
- Well, what about...
- I don't wanna hear it.

20:35.438 --> 20:37.634
Well, what about Kiki,
didn't she call you?

20:37.667 --> 20:39.482
No, why would she do that? I
don't even wanna talk to her.

20:39.511 --> 20:41.317
I kind of got my hands full, man.
