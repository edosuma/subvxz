I'm pleasantly surprised.

What do you mean
you still have no lead?!

01:09.206 --> 01:12.308
If this was Paris, the Garde
would already have caught

01:12.309 --> 01:14.777
the madman who dared
to shoot at Coco Chanel.

01:15.812 --> 01:17.646
I cannot waste another second.

01:17.647 --> 01:19.782
I've got a fashion show
to prepare for!

01:23.320 --> 01:24.754
Um, excuse me?

01:24.755 --> 01:26.155
- Uh...
- <i>Oui?</i>

01:26.156 --> 01:28.557
Um... Miss Chanel.

01:28.558 --> 01:29.925
I beg your pardon.

01:29.926 --> 01:31.394
Um, I couldn't help

01:31.395 --> 01:34.296
but overhear your squabble
just now, and...

01:34.297 --> 01:37.233
I was wondering that if
by any chance, uh,

01:37.234 --> 01:39.335
you might be interested
in an alternative means

01:39.336 --> 01:41.604
of investigation...

01:41.605 --> 01:43.572
I might know someone who can help you.

01:44.908 --> 01:46.342
Go on.

"A bullet was some greeting

01:48.578 --> 01:51.013
"The entire fashion world

01:51.014 --> 01:52.248
What will be next?"

01:52.249 --> 01:55.818
Well, leave it to Lipstick
to sensationalize the story.

01:55.819 --> 01:58.254
Perhaps now you understand
my predicament?

01:58.255 --> 01:59.789
I do, but...

01:59.790 --> 02:02.124
a high profile figure like yourself?

02:02.125 --> 02:03.225
I would have thought
the coppers would be

02:03.226 --> 02:05.161
- all over this...
- I'll be six feet under

02:05.162 --> 02:07.229
before your "coppers"
find this madman.

02:07.230 --> 02:08.964
I take it they're not
making much progress.

02:08.965 --> 02:11.834
Zero. Perhaps if they
loosened their belts,

02:11.835 --> 02:13.536
more oxygen would reach their brains.

02:13.537 --> 02:16.038
I fear some would need
to lose their pants entirely

02:16.039 --> 02:17.440
before we saw any improvement.

02:17.441 --> 02:19.141
I have no confidence in them.

02:19.142 --> 02:21.343
So, will you take the case?

02:21.344 --> 02:22.978
Of course.

02:22.979 --> 02:24.113
<i>Merci.</i>

02:24.114 --> 02:25.347
Just one question.

02:26.616 --> 02:28.684
Why do you have more confidence in me?

02:28.685 --> 02:31.153
If there's one thing
I've learned over the years,

02:31.154 --> 02:32.988
Miss Drake, it's that I can

02:32.989 --> 02:35.357
always trust a woman in pants.

02:51.942 --> 02:54.543
So, you came to Toronto
at Mr. Eaton's request?

02:54.544 --> 02:57.746
Precisely, to put on a fashion
show of my latest line:

02:57.747 --> 03:00.149
a collection of <i>petites robes,</i>

03:00.150 --> 03:02.451
little dresses for all purposes

03:02.452 --> 03:04.386
that every modern woman should own.

03:04.387 --> 03:05.821
They're beautiful.

03:05.822 --> 03:07.456
Do they breed enemies?

03:07.457 --> 03:09.658
One doesn't become
queen of Paris couture

03:09.659 --> 03:11.227
without amassing a few enemies.

03:11.228 --> 03:12.495
Even in Toronto?

03:12.496 --> 03:14.396
Fashion travels the world, Miss Drake.

03:14.397 --> 03:16.632
Fair enough. Now, before the shooting,

03:16.633 --> 03:18.234
did you notice anything unusual?

03:18.235 --> 03:20.736
Only a crowd of adoring fans.

03:20.737 --> 03:22.071
Not all adoring, I'm afraid.

03:23.240 --> 03:25.441
In the photograph in the paper,
you were being escorted

03:25.442 --> 03:26.642
out of the car by two gentlemen.

03:26.643 --> 03:28.010
I'd like to talk to them, if possible.

- Oh!</i>

03:37.320 --> 03:38.954
You are Coco's...

03:39.856 --> 03:41.290
Business associate.

03:41.291 --> 03:43.926
Phillippe was a procurement
officer in the French army.

03:43.927 --> 03:47.296
He sources fabrics for me
of the highest quality.

03:47.297 --> 03:48.831
He has excellent taste.

03:48.832 --> 03:52.067
Coco's key to success
is the quality of her designs,

03:52.068 --> 03:54.937
not her fabrics. Edmund Robinson.

03:54.938 --> 03:57.940
My generous supporter
and other war hero.

03:57.941 --> 04:00.409

Of course, we all served

04:00.410 --> 04:01.844
our country in the Great War.

04:01.845 --> 04:04.246
Some, however, were leaders of men.

04:04.247 --> 04:06.348
Come now, gentleman.
Miss Drake is here

04:06.349 --> 04:07.850
to investigate the shooting.

04:07.851 --> 04:10.219
Did either of you
notice anything unusual?

04:10.220 --> 04:13.122
Unfortunately, I was too busy
trying to avoid a bullet.

04:13.123 --> 04:16.458
I was completely focused
on getting Coco to safety.

04:19.495 --> 04:20.796
I don't understand.

04:20.797 --> 04:23.098
How will talking to Edmund
and Phillippe help you

04:23.099 --> 04:25.034
- find this madman?
- Well, you do your job,

04:25.035 --> 04:26.135
and I'll do mine.

04:27.470 --> 04:28.737
Excellent idea.

04:28.738 --> 04:31.373
I'll start by looking
at the scene of the shooting,

04:31.374 --> 04:32.808
but I'd like to plant someone in here

04:32.809 --> 04:33.976
to keep an eye on things.

04:33.977 --> 04:35.544
And who might that be?

04:35.545 --> 04:37.079
I have just the person.

04:37.080 --> 04:40.249
(FAST-PACED MUSIC)

04:43.186 --> 04:44.653
This is so exciting!

04:44.654 --> 04:47.356
I finally get to see
you work a case first-hand!

04:47.357 --> 04:49.191
Just don't let it get out, Dot.

04:50.126 --> 04:51.560
How long have we been friends?

04:51.561 --> 04:53.028
You know I'm a vault.

04:53.029 --> 04:54.730
One question though...

04:54.731 --> 04:55.898
where do you keep your gun?

04:55.899 --> 04:57.766
SH! (GIGGLING)

04:57.767 --> 04:59.802
So, who are these seamstresses?

04:59.803 --> 05:01.870
Any of them arrive here
from Paris with Coco?

05:01.871 --> 05:04.306
Oh, no. Everyone here
works for Mr. Eaton.

05:04.307 --> 05:07.042
Coco's line was mostly finished
when we arrived.

05:07.043 --> 05:08.210
We're all here on hand

05:08.211 --> 05:10.245
for mostly alterations and fittings.

05:10.246 --> 05:11.714
Who's the new girl?

05:11.715 --> 05:14.583
Um, Ruth, this is my...

05:14.584 --> 05:16.351
Apprentice. Trudy.

05:17.253 --> 05:18.687
She'll be assisting with the show.

05:18.688 --> 05:20.122
I'm very excited to be here!

05:20.123 --> 05:22.124
Someone dressed for the occasion.

05:22.125 --> 05:25.427
How very voguish
for a lowly seamstress.

05:25.428 --> 05:28.197
Oh, this! Well, it's a Dot original.

05:28.198 --> 05:29.698
She's made my dresses for years.

05:29.699 --> 05:31.066
She's got a great talent.

05:31.067 --> 05:33.402
You don't say. Well, now.

05:33.403 --> 05:34.903
Best get back to work.

05:38.808 --> 05:40.542
Why don't I help you get you started?

05:42.178 --> 05:45.280
It's a tad grainy,
but based on this photograph,

05:45.281 --> 05:47.216
when the shot was fired,

05:47.217 --> 05:49.151
Coco was standing right about here.

05:49.152 --> 05:52.454
Actually, I would say
it would be more like... here.

05:52.455 --> 05:54.923
And what makes you think
Coco was standing here?

05:54.924 --> 05:56.425
It would have to be.

05:56.426 --> 05:57.526
Let's look around.

05:58.461 --> 06:00.929
Right. Right. Because of the
proximity of that lamp post.

06:00.930 --> 06:02.531
I don't know how I missed that!

06:02.532 --> 06:04.933
Looks like the bullet landed here,

06:04.934 --> 06:07.536
which means that the shot

06:07.537 --> 06:08.804
would have been fired

06:08.805 --> 06:11.407
from the fifth or sixth floor
of that building.

06:11.408 --> 06:14.076
Are you sure?
The police seem fairly certain

06:14.077 --> 06:15.844
that the shooter was on the roof.

06:15.845 --> 06:17.946
Well... agree to disagree.

06:18.848 --> 06:20.315
Uh, yeah.

06:21.584 --> 06:22.684
Oh, watch out!

06:25.422 --> 06:27.589
I'll admit I pictured it differently.

06:27.590 --> 06:30.325
Are all fashion show
preparations this intense?

06:30.326 --> 06:32.428
You're confusing intensity with fear.

06:32.429 --> 06:34.797
- Oh?
- Since you're working for her,

06:34.798 --> 06:36.031
you should probably know

06:36.032 --> 06:38.200
Coco doesn't handle
disappointment very well.

06:38.201 --> 06:40.002
- Or at all.
- Wow.

06:41.638 --> 06:43.072
It's positively sinful!

06:43.073 --> 06:45.507
Do you know the models have all
been instructed to wear these?!

06:45.508 --> 06:48.544
If you ask me, she's trying
to turn women into boys!

06:48.545 --> 06:50.612
You're living
in a different era, Ruth.

06:54.184 --> 06:57.352
I simply think a woman should
design for a woman's body.

06:58.354 --> 07:00.789
You know, I don't exactly disagree.

07:00.790 --> 07:03.225
There's something undeniably feminine

07:03.226 --> 07:06.495
- about the Victorian silhouette.
- I couldn't agree more.

07:06.496 --> 07:08.797
Perhaps we have more
in common than I thought.

07:15.305 --> 07:16.872
Wow. That's commitment to the cause.

07:16.873 --> 07:19.241
Someone has to take a stand
before things get too dire.

07:19.242 --> 07:23.111
Besides, what's so awful
about a good solid corset?

07:32.655 --> 07:34.515
- Oh! Pardon me, miss.
- Excuse me! So sorry.

07:35.759 --> 07:37.426
You know, it's awfully nervy

07:37.427 --> 07:40.562
coming into a bustling building
during prime business hours

07:40.563 --> 07:41.997
and firing a rifle.

07:50.440 --> 07:53.542
(SOFT MUSIC)

07:56.446 --> 07:58.680
So you think the shooter
holed himself up in here?

07:58.681 --> 08:00.349
It's a possibility.

08:07.857 --> 08:09.258
Mary, take a look at this.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.529
All I see is this little groove...

08:13.530 --> 08:16.899
It's the perfect spot
to brace the barrel of a rifle.

08:18.034 --> 08:19.668
Now, we just need to find the casing.

08:23.406 --> 08:24.940
So, are you saying the shooter

08:24.941 --> 08:26.308
was positioned like this?

08:27.911 --> 08:29.011
More like...

08:30.513 --> 08:32.414
Right, because of that sign post.

08:32.414 --> 08:35.017
That's a pretty steep incline,

08:35.018 --> 08:36.751
- which means...
- Uh! Uh!

08:36.753 --> 08:37.953
Do you think you should be doing that?

08:37.953 --> 08:39.087
Probably not.

08:42.692 --> 08:43.792
Ah!

08:46.429 --> 08:48.196
Bingo.

08:51.100 --> 08:52.334
The shell casing!

08:55.338 --> 08:57.839
Mary... look at that.

09:03.713 --> 09:05.380
Hey, what do you know about Ruth?

09:05.381 --> 09:07.015
I've known her for years.

09:07.016 --> 09:09.084
I'll admit she's a bit
of a curmudgeon.

09:09.085 --> 09:10.319
I noticed.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.020
Didn't start out that way.

09:13.256 --> 09:14.289
How so?

09:14.290 --> 09:15.757
She was a corset maker.

09:15.758 --> 09:17.092
One of the best in the city.

09:17.093 --> 09:18.360
Even had one of her own shops.

09:18.361 --> 09:19.461
- Really?
- Mm-hmm!

09:19.462 --> 09:21.630
Well, it's because she can pass.

09:21.631 --> 09:22.965
Oh...

09:22.966 --> 09:24.666
Then, overnight, she became obsolete,

09:24.667 --> 09:27.936
even lost her shop, all because
of a peasant girl from Paris.

09:27.937 --> 09:29.438
So, Chanel loosened the waistline

09:29.439 --> 09:31.874
- and put Ruth out of business.
- And now, she's sewing hems

09:31.875 --> 09:33.642
for Coco Chanel. Just imagine.

09:33.643 --> 09:35.844
- Well, why do it?
- Girl's gotta make a living.

09:35.845 --> 09:37.512
Haven't you ever worked
for somebody you didn't like?

09:37.513 --> 09:39.181
Never long enough to let it fester.

09:39.182 --> 09:40.382
You let something stew long enough,

09:40.383 --> 09:41.817
something's bound to boil over.

09:41.818 --> 09:44.553
- You're not saying that Ruth...
- I'm not saying anything.

09:53.463 --> 09:55.697
It seems this board
has been pried up before.

09:59.435 --> 10:00.702
Look at the space down there.

10:00.703 --> 10:02.037
It's just right.

10:03.006 --> 10:04.539
Perfect fit for a rifle.

10:05.875 --> 10:08.543
So after the shooting,
they stashed the rifle in here.

10:08.544 --> 10:09.978
- Why?
- So they could

10:09.979 --> 10:11.179
walk out of here clean.

10:11.180 --> 10:12.414
But the rifle's gone now.

10:12.415 --> 10:13.982
Right. They came back to pick it up

10:13.983 --> 10:15.083
once the heat died down.

10:16.119 --> 10:17.219
Oh...

10:27.196 --> 10:29.765
What kind of flower delivery
guy delivers flowers

10:29.766 --> 10:31.099
and keeps the box?

10:35.038 --> 10:36.138
Frankie!

(FAST-PACED MUSIC)

10:43.012 --> 10:44.212
Damn it!

10:44.213 --> 10:45.948
He strolled right out
of here with the rifle

10:45.949 --> 10:47.282

Coco needed someone

- What Coco needed was freedom

He should've taught you
to have thicker skin.

21:06.340 --> 21:08.008
Well, I guess he was busy
being a single parent!

21:08.009 --> 21:10.176
He wasn't a saint!
He was a grifter, like me.

21:10.177 --> 21:12.245
Really? Is this why you
tricked me into coming here?

21:12.246 --> 21:14.180
Who's feeding you
the dirt on Coco Chanel?

21:14.181 --> 21:16.283
A journalist never
reveals her sources.

21:16.284 --> 21:17.484
Good thing you're not a journalist.

21:17.485 --> 21:19.185
- You're a gossip columnist.
- That is elitist!

21:19.186 --> 21:20.553
I'm giving the people what they want.

21:20.554 --> 21:22.923
By the way, is Coco really
as tyrannical as she seems?

21:22.924 --> 21:24.424
Shouldn't you already
know the answer to that

21:24.425 --> 21:26.326
before writing these damning
articles about her?

21:26.327 --> 21:27.560
Frankie, why be
such a stick in the mud?

21:27.561 --> 21:29.629
Nobody likes this.
Nobody takes my stuff seriously.

21:29.630 --> 21:31.431
- It's a bunch of tittle-tattle.
- Somebody has it out

21:31.432 --> 21:32.966
for Coco and I think it's your source.

21:32.967 --> 21:34.401
I so wish I could help.

21:34.402 --> 21:36.469
- Fine.
- Fine.

21:36.470 --> 21:38.705
I thought you would
want in on the action.

21:41.676 --> 21:43.777
I'm getting my notes
from a seamstress.

21:48.816 --> 21:50.817
So, it's one of the
seamstresses who has been

21:50.818 --> 21:52.185
feeding Lipstick the dirt.

21:52.186 --> 21:53.520
Then it's Ruth. It has to be.

21:53.521 --> 21:55.955
Some tips that were
left in her drop box.

21:58.859 --> 22:00.293
What is it?

22:00.294 --> 22:01.795
This handwriting...

22:01.796 --> 22:04.097
- I recognize it.
- You do?

22:04.999 --> 22:06.033
It's Dot's.

22:11.772 --> 22:13.907
Don't be ridiculous.
I do not have the time

22:13.908 --> 22:16.009
nor the energy to be
spreading petty gossip.

22:16.010 --> 22:17.710
Are you sure?

22:17.711 --> 22:19.045
Maybe you wanted to knock her
down a few pegs?

22:19.046 --> 22:20.913
That's preposterous.

22:25.352 --> 22:28.721
I've known you long enough to
know your own handwriting, Dot.

22:28.722 --> 22:30.356
What's going on, Dot?

22:30.357 --> 22:32.425
(SIGHING)

22:32.426 --> 22:35.094
That magazine makes her out to
be some kind of grand saviour.

22:35.095 --> 22:37.163
The fashion world's Joan of Arc!

22:37.164 --> 22:39.399
So, you wanted everyone
to know the real Coco.

22:40.467 --> 22:42.302
You fed Lipstick the inside scoop.

22:42.303 --> 22:44.103
But why? What's in it for you?

22:46.440 --> 22:48.241
Does it have something
to do with your clothing line

22:48.242 --> 22:50.543
- pitched with Mr. Eaton?
- Of course not.

22:51.679 --> 22:52.779
Dot...

22:53.814 --> 22:57.216
I had a line of ready-to-wear
dresses all set to go.

22:57.217 --> 22:59.485
Mr. Eaton was gonna
co-sign a loan for me.

22:59.486 --> 23:01.054
But nothing happened.

23:01.055 --> 23:02.322
You blame Coco?

23:02.323 --> 23:04.590
Negotiations mysteriously
fell through the moment

23:04.591 --> 23:07.193
she showed up.
That woman came from nothing.

23:07.194 --> 23:09.262
You'd think she'd sympathize
with the little people.

23:09.263 --> 23:11.197
And what about the shooting? The fire?

23:13.634 --> 23:15.234
You think I had
something to do with that?

23:15.235 --> 23:16.936
Well, you were one
of the last people in here

23:16.937 --> 23:18.071
before the fire started.

23:18.072 --> 23:19.439
And you could have
just as easily hired

23:19.440 --> 23:20.440
the shooter as anyone else.

23:20.441 --> 23:21.841
You know me, Trudy.

23:21.842 --> 23:23.576
You know I'm a God-fearing woman.

23:24.678 --> 23:26.813
Frankly, I'm offended
by the accusation.

23:26.814 --> 23:28.348
If you'll excuse me.

23:28.349 --> 23:29.615
(SIGHING)

23:34.421 --> 23:35.588
I don't know, Frankie.

23:35.589 --> 23:36.556
It doesn't make sense.

23:36.557 --> 23:38.524
Dot's line is ready-to-wear

23:38.525 --> 23:39.859
and Coco's haute couture.

23:39.860 --> 23:41.995
Technically, they're not
in any competition.

23:41.996 --> 23:45.765
So why would Coco
have her line cancelled?

23:45.766 --> 23:48.267
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

23:48.268 --> 23:50.370
Dot is convinced that you sabotaged

23:50.371 --> 23:51.871
her deal with Mr. Eaton.

23:51.872 --> 23:54.741
Respectfully, why would I care?

23:54.742 --> 23:56.309
Well, that is a good question.

24:02.082 --> 24:04.584
For what it's worth, I believe you.

24:06.987 --> 24:08.888
Look, I have to consider
all possibilities.

24:08.889 --> 24:10.990
- It's my job!
- And this is my job,

24:10.991 --> 24:12.725
which I'm not doing particularly well.

24:12.726 --> 24:14.560
Look at this mess!

24:14.561 --> 24:16.062
Coco will have my head.

24:18.065 --> 24:19.799
Not if she never knows about it.

24:21.101 --> 24:22.401
I'll dispose of the evidence.

24:29.109 --> 24:30.810
(ENIGMATIC MUSIC)

Gently! That chiffon is pure silk!

24:36.450 --> 24:38.017
(SIGHING)

24:38.018 --> 24:40.119
I have barely even
spoken to Mr. Eaton.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.821
That's Phillippe's job.

24:41.822 --> 24:44.023
If anyone cancelled anything,
it was him.

24:45.225 --> 24:48.361
<i>Non! Non! Non, non, non,
non, non! C'est pas vrai!</i>

24:48.362 --> 24:50.062
Frankie. You might want to see this.

24:52.866 --> 24:55.168
(FRANKIE): So, this is what's
left of Coco's burnt dresses?

24:55.169 --> 24:56.836
What's left of something, anyway.

24:56.837 --> 24:58.738
The rule to Coco's dresses

24:58.739 --> 25:01.240
is 10 identical stitches per inch.

25:01.241 --> 25:02.608
But look at this.

25:03.510 --> 25:05.011
It looks pretty close to me.

25:05.012 --> 25:07.146
I've seen this woman in action.

25:07.147 --> 25:08.447
"Pretty close" doesn't cut it.

25:09.483 --> 25:10.850
I don't think
these are Coco's dresses.

25:10.851 --> 25:12.752
I think they're imitations.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.721
OK. Why don't you take
these swatches to Flo,

25:15.722 --> 25:17.156
see if she can confirm
that they're fake.

25:17.157 --> 25:18.257
OK.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.429
What did she find?

25:23.430 --> 25:25.431
If something's going on in my atelier,

25:25.432 --> 25:26.732
I demand to know about it!

25:26.733 --> 25:28.701
There's nothing to report.
At least not yet.

25:28.702 --> 25:30.937
Then why was your partner
rushing out so quickly?

25:30.938 --> 25:32.271
Well, she's following up on a lead,

25:32.272 --> 25:34.073
but as soon as we have
anything concrete,

25:34.074 --> 25:35.374
you will be the first to know.

25:37.144 --> 25:39.879
I hate feeling like this.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.380
I get it.

25:41.381 --> 25:43.449
You're used to being in control.

25:43.450 --> 25:45.284
This is unsettling.

25:46.620 --> 25:48.854
It's not just the loss
of control, Frankie.

25:50.657 --> 25:53.159
Would it shock you terribly
to hear me say...

25:53.160 --> 25:55.494
I'm a little bit afraid?

25:56.663 --> 25:58.865
It would shock me more to hear
if you weren't.

25:58.866 --> 26:00.900
Everybody thinks I'm fearless,

26:00.901 --> 26:02.768
but don't be fooled.

26:02.769 --> 26:04.737
Fear can easily be disguised.

26:04.738 --> 26:07.507
All it takes is a pretty dress
and a simple hat.

26:07.508 --> 26:10.009
Perhaps it doesn't
always need to be disguised.

26:10.010 --> 26:11.811
Never show weakness.

26:11.812 --> 26:14.814
It's always been
my survival technique.

26:14.815 --> 26:17.149
And are you starting
to question its effectiveness?

26:20.154 --> 26:21.254
Possibly.

26:22.389 --> 26:24.390
I'm gonna get
to the bottom of this, Coco.

26:24.391 --> 26:26.158
You have my word.

26:27.327 --> 26:28.894
I expect no less.

26:32.566 --> 26:34.433
(FLO): Yep, there's no doubt about it.

26:34.434 --> 26:36.602
I'm definitely seeing
both flat twisted ribbons

26:36.603 --> 26:38.938
and scaly corkscrew patterns
on this swatch.

26:38.939 --> 26:40.606
It's a blended fabric.

26:40.607 --> 26:42.308
Did the dress flare up quickly?

26:42.309 --> 26:44.377
Well, one minute, it's hanging neatly,

26:44.378 --> 26:46.445
and then the next,
the entire row went ablaze.

26:46.446 --> 26:48.281
As I suspected.

26:48.282 --> 26:49.815
It's a wool-cotton blend.

26:49.816 --> 26:52.351
Wool burns slowly, but it's
quite difficult to ignite.

26:52.352 --> 26:54.320
So, if there were real flames,
it was from the cotton.

26:54.321 --> 26:55.721
OK. Well, one thing's for sure,

26:55.722 --> 26:58.291
Coco Chanel's real dresses were
not made of blended fabric.

26:58.292 --> 27:00.660
She's a 100% wool jersey type of lady.

27:01.662 --> 27:02.828
That's a type now?

27:02.829 --> 27:03.963
Mm-hmm.

27:07.234 --> 27:09.902
So, why would someone
burn fake dresses

27:09.903 --> 27:11.504
and steal Coco's originals?

27:11.505 --> 27:12.605
To sell them?

27:13.574 --> 27:15.841
That seems like an awful lot
of trouble to go to for whatever

27:15.842 --> 27:17.476
a handful of dresses might be worth.

27:17.477 --> 27:19.212
Yeah, well, there's
a real market for high fashion

27:19.213 --> 27:20.479
at low prices...

27:20.480 --> 27:23.216
So, someone stole them
to copy the pattern

27:23.217 --> 27:24.650
to make cheap Chanel knock-offs?

27:24.651 --> 27:27.019
Well, I know a lot of gals who
would kill for a Chanel dress,

27:27.020 --> 27:29.555
- even if it was a knock-off.
- Wouldn't those dresses fall

27:29.556 --> 27:31.924
- in the ready-to-wear category?
- Yeah. Dot's line would have

27:31.925 --> 27:34.193
stood in direct competition to that.

27:34.194 --> 27:36.829
So, maybe Phillippe had it cancelled

27:36.830 --> 27:38.764
to knock-off Coco's dresses

27:38.765 --> 27:40.185
so he could sell them to Eaton's.

27:41.068 --> 27:42.268
It's a theory.

27:42.269 --> 27:43.502
But how do we prove it?

27:43.503 --> 27:45.338
I have an idea.

28:43.764 --> 28:45.598
like your opinion on.

That's my desk.
What are you doing here?

29:05.452 --> 29:09.522
Well, I just received
a rather troubling call

29:09.523 --> 29:11.123
from one of my fellow
morality officers.

29:11.124 --> 29:13.125
- Really?
- How troubling, you might ask?

29:13.126 --> 29:16.028
- You're gonna tell me.
- Well, it seems that she was

29:16.029 --> 29:18.297
approaching a rather
questionable individual

29:18.298 --> 29:20.599
when the reprobate
ran off at full speed!

29:20.600 --> 29:22.535
- So, are you saying to me...
- That someone who runs

29:22.536 --> 29:24.704
from a morality officer is
someone with something to hide?

29:24.705 --> 29:26.772
Well, yes, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

29:26.773 --> 29:29.275
- Officer Shaw...
- So, I offered to see

29:29.276 --> 29:31.043

her visual description

29:31.044 --> 29:33.612

30:06.947 --> 30:09.415
When I read about you in this paper,

30:09.416 --> 30:12.218
I was struck. Your ideas
about the future of fashion

30:12.219 --> 30:14.620
- were spot on.
- Well, I stand by every word!

30:14.621 --> 30:17.556
In the old days, only the elite
were worried about fashion,

- It's no different in Paris.
- Yeah! All these new women,

30:21.027 --> 30:22.328
they want to dress like Coco Chanel,

30:22.329 --> 30:24.096
but without breaking the bank,
and who can blame them?

requested meetings with me

- Yeah, a couple of Montrealers.

to keep the trip brief,
