WEBVTT

00:05.839 --> 00:08.508
- All right, so, like, should I text her back?

00:08.575 --> 00:12.345
'Cause I-I-I think she, like, thinks I'm a loser.

00:12.412 --> 00:15.215
- You shouldn't be with someone that makes you feel that way,

00:15.315 --> 00:17.550
especially after the year you've had.

00:17.650 --> 00:20.487
And Jerry, you're not a loser.

00:20.553 --> 00:22.489
You're fabulous.

00:22.555 --> 00:24.224
And you have so much love to give.

00:24.324 --> 00:26.826
You should be with someone who wants what you want.

00:26.893 --> 00:28.094
- Thanks, Dory.

00:28.194 --> 00:29.262
Yeah, I feel like you're the only one

00:29.362 --> 00:30.830
I could talk to around here.

00:30.897 --> 00:32.899
- Well, lucky for you I'm not going anywhere.

00:32.999 --> 00:36.069
Oh, by the way, I made this for you.

00:36.169 --> 00:38.671
Baking class. It's banana bread.

00:38.738 --> 00:41.741
- Aw, that's sweet but you know I can't take it from you.

00:41.841 --> 00:44.177
- I know but you don't have to eat it.

00:44.778 --> 00:46.846
Just take it so you don't hurt my feelings.

00:46.913 --> 00:49.349
- All right, just don't tell nobody, all right?

00:55.722 --> 00:58.691
- Good night. - Night.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.320
I'm so sorry, Jerry.

02:00.420 --> 02:03.256
I'll find a way to pay you back, I promise.

02:38.958 --> 02:41.561
- I'm telling you, I do not vote.

02:41.661 --> 02:42.729
I do not vote.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.131
I will not vote. I just will not.

02:45.198 --> 02:46.866
- You have to vote.

02:46.966 --> 02:50.970
- I will not and I do not.

02:57.911 --> 02:59.579
Security!

02:59.679 --> 03:01.481
Dory, come back here! -

03:01.548 --> 03:02.549
- No, Dory, no!

03:20.166 --> 03:22.402
- - I'm sorry!

03:22.502 --> 03:24.103
You'll be okay.

03:31.578 --> 03:32.912
Shit, come on.

04:08.648 --> 04:10.883
- Hello, world.

04:12.552 --> 04:14.320
This is Dory Sief.

04:14.420 --> 04:18.391
You may remember me from the past.

04:18.458 --> 04:20.493
You may hate me

04:20.593 --> 04:24.297
or you may love me.

04:24.397 --> 04:27.734
But I have to reach everyone quickly

04:27.800 --> 04:31.804
because I have something that I need to share,

04:31.904 --> 04:36.476
which is that I died

04:36.576 --> 04:39.012
for 37 seconds.

04:39.112 --> 04:41.314
And in that time,

04:41.414 --> 04:43.850
I received an infinite volume

04:43.950 --> 04:45.652
of unconscious wisdom

04:45.752 --> 04:50.657
and submitted to pure love.

04:50.757 --> 04:53.493
I did it.

04:53.593 --> 04:57.530
And now more than anything, I want you to do it.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.800
I am going to find a way

05:00.867 --> 05:06.205
for everyone to experience an awakening.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.508
- Oh, yeah, that's s--such a pleasure-y spot.

05:08.608 --> 05:12.345
- Yeah. Feeling good.

05:12.445 --> 05:14.681
- Yeah. Oh.

05:14.781 --> 05:16.382
- Okay, sorry. I'm sorry.

05:16.482 --> 05:17.850
I didn't--don't want to do time out

05:17.950 --> 05:19.786
but is there a bug in my eye?

05:19.852 --> 05:21.454
- No, but you look--it looks like you could be

05:21.521 --> 05:23.389
getting a--an eye infection.

05:23.489 --> 05:25.124
Oh--oh, God.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.060
Elliott's called, like, three times.

05:27.160 --> 05:29.162
I just wanna pick this up and make sure everything's cool--

05:29.228 --> 05:30.630
- Okay. Yeah.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.365
- Get off me, get off me, get off me, thank you.

05:32.465 --> 05:33.866
Hi, baba ghanoush.

05:33.966 --> 05:35.568
- Have you seen Dory's video?

05:35.668 --> 05:37.870
- No, I'm still, like, naked in bed.

05:37.970 --> 05:39.205
- Why would you say that?

05:39.305 --> 05:41.541
- Okay, we gotta call Drew. Hang on.

05:41.641 --> 05:44.577
- Did he say call Drew?

05:44.677 --> 05:46.713
Oh, my God.

05:46.813 --> 05:50.049
- Go, go, go, go.

05:50.149 --> 05:51.384
- Hi.

05:51.484 --> 05:52.719
- Hey, I have Portia on the other line.

05:52.819 --> 05:54.487
I'm gonna put us together, one sec.

05:54.554 --> 05:57.824
- Oh, cool. - Hey, okay.

05:57.890 --> 06:01.527
So apparently Dory fled the institution

06:01.594 --> 06:03.596
and then posted some bizarre video

06:03.696 --> 06:05.932
about the meaning of life. It's truly unhinged.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.333
- Whoa. - Ah!

06:07.400 --> 06:09.001
- So she's just on the lam?

06:09.068 --> 06:11.404
- Mm, no, no, no, no.

06:11.504 --> 06:13.005
I'm looking it up, like, right now.

06:13.072 --> 06:15.375
I really, really, really, really--

06:15.441 --> 06:17.076
- You guys have, like, a terrible echo.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.511
It almost sounds like you're together.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.613
I'm going to hang up and try again.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.081
- Hello, world.

06:22.181 --> 06:23.783
This is Dory Sief.

06:23.883 --> 06:26.085
You may remember me from the past.

06:26.185 --> 06:27.854
You may hate me.

06:27.920 --> 06:29.622
- Hi. - One sec.

06:29.722 --> 06:32.392
- You may love me, but I have to reach everyone quickly.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.061
- Hey. - Okay, one sec.

06:35.128 --> 06:36.596
- I have something that

06:36.696 --> 06:38.631
I need to share which is that--

06:38.731 --> 06:40.733
- Hey, okay, are we good?

06:40.800 --> 06:42.135
- Mm-hmm.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.071
- Wow, so she's still talking like this, huh?

06:45.138 --> 06:48.641
I thought this was what they were supposed to cure her of?

06:48.741 --> 06:51.110
- Look, I think if she contacts any of us, we just avoid,

06:51.210 --> 06:53.579
avoid, avoid, avoid, avoid. And you know what?

06:53.646 --> 06:55.648
I actually can't have this conversation right now

06:55.748 --> 06:57.417
because it sounds like you're watching the video

06:57.483 --> 07:01.387
at the exact same time and it's driving me crazy, okay?

07:01.454 --> 07:04.157
I'm gonna hang up.

07:04.257 --> 07:06.125
- You know, I keep refreshing and she gains

07:06.225 --> 07:08.761
another 50,000 followers every second.

07:08.828 --> 07:10.630
- - She's going to have, like,

07:10.730 --> 07:13.132
4 million followers by the end of the day,

07:17.637 --> 07:20.640
- Are my shoes...

07:20.740 --> 07:22.141
glued to me?

07:22.241 --> 07:25.478
- I don't know. Are they?

07:25.578 --> 07:27.914
- How could this be?

07:27.980 --> 07:30.983
- Oh, come here.

07:31.083 --> 07:32.785
- Is something the matter?

07:35.288 --> 07:38.124
- You didn't put glue in my shoes, did you, sweetie?

07:38.191 --> 07:40.860
- I wouldn't even know where to find glue, fathers,

07:40.960 --> 07:43.196
and I would never do anything to inconvenience

07:43.296 --> 07:46.098
such a wonderful and handsome man.

07:48.434 --> 07:52.138
- So my question for you is this.

07:52.205 --> 07:57.009
How can you die?

07:57.109 --> 08:00.379
How can you kill off your ego?

08:00.480 --> 08:02.815
How can you fall into the cosmic

08:02.882 --> 08:05.818
and integrate every aspect of yourself?

08:05.885 --> 08:08.120
I don't know what the answer is,

08:08.187 --> 08:10.790
but I do know what the question is.

08:10.857 --> 08:15.027
How can we all die?

08:15.127 --> 08:16.829
Let me know in the comments below

08:16.896 --> 08:19.699
which solution resonates most with you.

08:19.799 --> 08:22.869
I love you.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.145
I really did. I connected with the people

08:33.212 --> 08:35.414
but they didn't have any trust, you know?

08:35.515 --> 08:37.383
And--and without trust you can't--oh,

08:37.483 --> 08:38.985
thank you, Helen. Thank you.

08:39.051 --> 08:40.520
- True, true.

08:40.586 --> 08:43.389
- So, you know, I just--I had to find a way out of it.

08:43.489 --> 08:44.857
And you know, I feel like I have

08:44.924 --> 08:46.492
this new mission to just spread peace.

08:46.559 --> 08:47.927
- Mm-hmm.

08:48.027 --> 08:50.196
- And I can't afford to be stopped.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.697
- Well, that certainly is a worthy cause

08:51.764 --> 08:53.566
but let me just give you a morsel of wisdom.

08:53.666 --> 08:54.734
- Mm-hmm.

08:54.834 --> 08:57.503
- If you tell the unpopular truth,

08:57.570 --> 08:58.771
they will try to stop you.

08:58.871 --> 09:01.207
They always have and they always will.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.875
- That's right.

09:02.942 --> 09:06.879
Well, you have come to the right place, baby.

09:06.946 --> 09:10.416
We were a part of the West Village 11.

09:10.516 --> 09:12.251
- No way. - Yes.

09:12.351 --> 09:15.087
- Wow. That's incredible. Yo--your generation,

09:15.187 --> 09:18.190
you had so much energy behind the causes, you know?

09:18.257 --> 09:19.692
That's what I want to harness.

09:19.759 --> 09:23.029
I want everybody to feel this with me.

09:23.095 --> 09:26.365
- Oh, they will--you know why? - Hmm?

09:26.432 --> 09:28.367
- You're starting a revolution.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.040
- Okay, so I've been going down the whole, like,

09:34.106 --> 09:37.410
Dory Sief wormhole, and I'm kind of, like, obsessed.

09:37.476 --> 09:40.146
She's a gay icon, and I've been a big fan since day one,

09:40.246 --> 09:42.114
like, during the whole shoot trial and everything

09:42.214 --> 09:43.616
and I tried to get a drink with her to, like, no avail

09:43.716 --> 09:44.750
but I'm like kind of honestly here

09:44.817 --> 09:45.785
for this comeback,

09:45.885 --> 09:47.320
you know what I mean?

09:47.420 --> 09:48.921
Like, I love the fact that she's dead now.

09:48.988 --> 09:50.489
No one's ever done that before.

09:50.590 --> 09:51.624
And I kind of-- I'm honestly thinking like

09:51.724 --> 09:52.892
should I die too?

09:52.959 --> 09:54.927
Like, should I be dead?

09:54.994 --> 09:56.629
You know what I mean? Let me know in the comments.

09:56.729 --> 09:58.831
- Hmm.

10:01.734 --> 10:05.338
- Hello.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.473
Hello, dear friends. Tunnel Quinn here.

10:07.573 --> 10:09.008
Hey.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.979
You know, the last person in the world

10:13.079 --> 10:15.014
that I'd have ever thought would be giving me

10:15.114 --> 10:19.185
spiritual advice is Dory Sief.

10:19.285 --> 10:23.456
I mean, I followed that court case closely,

10:23.522 --> 10:25.358
and I'm of the ilk who definitely believes

10:25.458 --> 10:27.960
that she-- she killed that guy.

10:28.027 --> 10:33.099
And the idea now that she'd be encouraging anybody to die

10:33.165 --> 10:36.268
is highly unsettling.

10:36.335 --> 10:38.170
This woman is not enlightened.

10:38.270 --> 10:40.172
I think it's a merely

10:40.272 --> 10:41.641
an escalation of her psychosis.

10:41.707 --> 10:43.609
No one should listen to her.

10:43.676 --> 10:46.779
There's only one person that you should ever listen to

10:46.846 --> 10:48.514
and that is me.

10:48.614 --> 10:52.485
Which reminds me, the new T-watch is coming out in what?

10:52.551 --> 10:54.887
Just 43 days.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.690
All get on the waitlist, people.

10:59.859 --> 11:02.328
- Hmm.

11:11.904 --> 11:14.340
- Hello, everyone.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.176
It has come to my attention

11:17.243 --> 11:22.815
that the tech billionaire and flamboyant personality

11:22.882 --> 11:28.220
Tunnel Quinn has publicly challenged my authenticity.

11:28.320 --> 11:33.826
And what I would like to say in response to that is this.

11:33.893 --> 11:39.098
Tunnel, I would encourage you of all people

11:39.198 --> 11:44.070
to try to understand what this could mean.

11:44.170 --> 11:48.107
As I start to unpack the process

11:48.207 --> 11:50.176
of my enlightened experience,

11:50.242 --> 11:54.080
I cannot deny or ignore the unpopular truth

11:54.180 --> 11:58.751
that death may very well be a potential gateway

11:58.851 --> 12:01.921
to an integrated and awakened life.

12:02.021 --> 12:05.257
I would love to hear your expert opinion

12:05.357 --> 12:09.028
on--on the science behind all of this.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.263
I love you, Tunnel.

12:56.142 --> 12:59.612
Oh, my--what! What are you doing?

12:59.678 --> 13:02.281
This is daddy's bubble tank.

13:02.348 --> 13:04.250
- I wanted to show you this.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.823
- Is that--is that plugged in?

13:10.923 --> 13:14.026
- Yes, I wanted to show you this.

13:16.162 --> 13:18.130
- Why?

13:18.197 --> 13:20.166
- I thought you might like toast.

13:20.266 --> 13:25.337
- Okay, please just leave.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.342
- Drew, I just don't understand why you won't tell us

13:30.442 --> 13:31.677
what you're doing for work.

13:31.777 --> 13:33.179
We're gonna find out eventually.

13:33.279 --> 13:34.446
- I don't see why it's any of your business--

13:34.513 --> 13:36.215
- Hi.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.885
Oh, my God. It's you.

13:39.985 --> 13:44.156
It's really you. You guys look so full of life.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.391
- How did you get in here?

13:45.491 --> 13:48.327
- I just crawled through the window.

13:48.394 --> 13:50.396
- Oh, you broke in? - Hmm.

13:50.496 --> 13:53.032
- All right. Are you doing okay, Dory?

13:53.132 --> 13:56.035
- Ugh, I am more than okay. Never been better.

13:56.135 --> 13:58.404
- Okay, okay, get out, yeah, good.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.872
- Oh, my God. You guys should see

13:59.972 --> 14:01.340
the way that you're looking at me right now.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.209
It is just too funny.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.544
But please you have nothing to be scared of.

14:05.644 --> 14:09.248
I promise you, I just come from a place of absolute love.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.351
It's okay. - What are you doing here?

14:12.418 --> 14:14.353
- Well...

14:14.420 --> 14:16.722
I made a reservation at this cute little restaurant

14:16.822 --> 14:18.357
down the street. It's supposed to be really good

14:18.424 --> 14:21.193
and they have an amazing wine list.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.663
- Oh--oh, yeah--

14:24.730 --> 14:27.266
I have to go, yeah. both: Mm...

14:27.366 --> 14:29.768
- No, Drew, come on. You have to eat.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.203
You've gotten too skinny.

14:31.270 --> 14:34.073
Mangia, mangia, mangia. Let's go.

14:39.511 --> 14:41.947
Mmm-mmm-mmm. Oh, my God.

14:42.047 --> 14:43.282
You guys, this is so great.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.718
You have to try some. You have to.

14:45.784 --> 14:49.054
Here. Mmm.

14:49.121 --> 14:51.423
Come here. Please, you have to.

14:51.523 --> 14:54.126
Come on.

14:55.461 --> 14:58.430
Porsh, try this.

14:58.530 --> 15:00.266
Come on. It's delicious.

15:00.366 --> 15:01.300
Drew, you're next.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.937
- Cool. Oh, yep.

15:05.037 --> 15:08.374
Mmm, mmm. -

15:08.440 --> 15:09.475
Right?

15:09.575 --> 15:12.578
- That was good.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.281
- "Good"? It's incredible.

15:15.381 --> 15:18.617
I mean, what did we do to deserve pasta, you know?

15:20.152 --> 15:23.489
- So, yeah, I hear you're enlightened.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.724
That--that rocks.

15:25.791 --> 15:27.993
- I am, I am.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.596
I know, it sounds so funny, you know, to hear it.

15:30.663 --> 15:36.302
I mean, I just see everything completely differently now.

15:39.338 --> 15:41.140
- What are y'all looking at?

15:41.240 --> 15:42.841
Hey, I got a right to be here.

15:42.942 --> 15:45.244
Hey, hey, hey, it's just water. Hey, I got it.

15:45.311 --> 15:46.979
- [mutters - Don't tell me--

15:47.079 --> 15:48.480
I don't know how to clean water.

15:48.580 --> 15:49.982
- Be right back.

15:50.082 --> 15:51.350
- Oh, no, no, no, no, Dory. Dory, Dory, don't engage.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.786
- Dory, Dory. - Don't engage.

15:56.989 --> 16:00.326
- Hi.

16:00.426 --> 16:02.161
I'm Dory.

16:02.261 --> 16:05.130
What's your name? -

16:05.197 --> 16:07.466
- Ooh, are you drinking whiskey?

16:07.533 --> 16:09.802
I love whiskey. Used to be my drink.

16:09.868 --> 16:13.205
Have you ever had it with a little hot tea?

16:13.305 --> 16:15.107
- No. - It's really nice.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.810
It's really calming.

16:17.876 --> 16:20.846
An old boyfriend of mine used to make it for me.

16:20.946 --> 16:23.449
Do you have anyone special in your life?

16:25.017 --> 16:28.120
- My wife.

16:30.222 --> 16:33.692
She died.

16:33.792 --> 16:35.961
- I'm so sorry to hear that.

16:36.028 --> 16:39.365
I bet you loved her very much.

16:43.969 --> 16:46.538
- It's okay. It's okay.

16:46.638 --> 16:47.973
It's okay.

16:48.040 --> 16:49.541
- No.

16:49.641 --> 16:53.879
- - It's okay, it's okay.

16:53.979 --> 16:56.215
It's okay.

16:56.315 --> 16:58.684
- What's going on?

17:00.986 --> 17:02.855
- It's okay.

17:02.921 --> 17:04.656
- I'm gonna cry.

17:04.723 --> 17:07.393
- So this was fun.

17:07.493 --> 17:10.863
Text us when you get a home. - So, so nice.

17:10.929 --> 17:13.832
We should make sure to do this again, like, this year.

17:13.899 --> 17:15.534
- Totally. - No.

17:15.601 --> 17:17.703
- 100%. - No, no, no, no, no!

17:17.770 --> 17:19.772
We only get this day once.

17:19.872 --> 17:21.740
I mean, we're not getting it back.

17:21.840 --> 17:24.610
So let's do it. I mean, let's really do it.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.245
Let's--let's do the day.

17:26.345 --> 17:28.347
- Okay, what do you wanna do?

17:28.414 --> 17:29.748
- I don't know.

17:29.848 --> 17:33.886
Let's see where the tide sails us, huh?

17:33.952 --> 17:35.521
- Fun.

17:50.702 --> 17:53.205
You got through it, you did. Shit everywhere.

17:59.478 --> 18:02.114
Oh, my gosh.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.584
It's our old apartment.

18:05.651 --> 18:07.786
- Wow. It's a different era.

18:07.886 --> 18:10.122
Don't you guys wish we could go in and, like,

18:10.222 --> 18:12.758
go back in time?

18:12.825 --> 18:15.394
- Why don't we? - Well, I moved out, you know.

18:15.461 --> 18:17.629
I'm sorry, your kidnapper made it seem like you wanted

18:17.729 --> 18:19.965
to move out so I-I moved us out.

18:20.065 --> 18:21.967
- Okay, but I think we should try and see

18:22.067 --> 18:24.803
what it looks like inside. Wouldn't that be fun?

18:24.903 --> 18:27.339
- Really? What if there are people in there?

18:27.439 --> 18:29.241
- Then we ask them to let us in.

18:29.308 --> 18:31.477
If nobody lives there, then we just break in.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.445
Come on. Live a little.

18:33.512 --> 18:36.248
- Aah, I'm ticklish. - Don't tickle me.

18:36.315 --> 18:39.284
- I'm scared to say no to you so let's.

18:39.351 --> 18:41.954
- This is so, so, so, so stupid.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.156
- Okay, how do you even know how to pick locks?

18:44.256 --> 18:45.791
- I can kind of do anything now.

18:45.858 --> 18:48.494
I have, like, access to the ancient divine wisdom.

18:48.594 --> 18:49.862
Oh, here we are.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.096
- Oh, my God.

18:51.163 --> 18:52.998
- Wait, what? - Oh, my God.

18:53.098 --> 18:56.268
- Oh, my God.

18:56.335 --> 18:58.470
- This is so bizarre.

18:58.537 --> 19:00.038
- What? - No.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.707
- God, this looks awful.

19:01.807 --> 19:05.944
- Oh, my God, these yuppies. - Oh, it looks so different.

19:06.011 --> 19:09.948
- What happened to the wall? - Oh, my God.

19:10.015 --> 19:11.517
- Oh, my God! Ew, the tile.

19:11.617 --> 19:12.684
- What?

19:12.784 --> 19:14.186
- Oh. - It's bad.

19:14.286 --> 19:16.722
- This doesn't even look like our place at all.

19:20.125 --> 19:24.463
- Drew, we lived here.

19:24.530 --> 19:26.298
- Yeah. Yeah, we did.

19:26.365 --> 19:29.668
- No, but--but lived.

19:29.735 --> 19:33.205
Like, we lived lived here.

19:33.305 --> 19:35.307
- Mm-hmm.

19:38.477 --> 19:41.713
- We were in love.

19:41.813 --> 19:43.348
- Yeah.

19:50.889 --> 19:53.225
- You guys, check this out. - What?

19:53.325 --> 19:54.560
- What? - It's a disco ball.

19:54.660 --> 19:55.827
- Oh, God. - What are you doing?

19:55.894 --> 19:57.095
- - We should go.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.597
- Oh, my God, you guys.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.032
It's a little speaker and it's Bluetooth.

20:00.098 --> 20:01.433
- No, Dory. - Hold on, one second.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.568
- Oh, my God.

20:02.668 --> 20:04.570
- Let's party.

20:04.670 --> 20:06.538
- Oh, my God.

20:08.173 --> 20:09.875
- This was your favorite song.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.777
- Dory, no. - Come on, dance with me.

20:44.109 --> 20:45.944
- Excuse me!

20:46.044 --> 20:48.080
What the hell are you doing? - Oh, my God.

20:48.146 --> 20:50.716
I'm so sorry. You must be so put off.

20:50.782 --> 20:53.952
But we used to live here. Like, live live.

20:54.052 --> 20:55.721
- Get the fuck out! - I'm sorry.

20:55.787 --> 20:57.222
We're gone.

20:57.289 --> 20:58.724
- Sorry, I love your style. Just kidding.

20:58.790 --> 21:01.426
- Bye. - Oh, whoa.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.965
- You guys, I haven't watched the sunset in so long.

21:07.065 --> 21:09.334
- It's incredible.

21:09.434 --> 21:11.303
- And we get to have it every day.

21:20.078 --> 21:24.082
- I wanna thank you guys for spending the day with me.

21:26.018 --> 21:28.787
And I want to say I'm sorry.

21:29.755 --> 21:32.924
I'm sorry for lying to you.

21:33.992 --> 21:36.461
I'm sorry for hurting you,

21:36.528 --> 21:39.831
for turning your lives upside down,

21:39.931 --> 21:43.302
for not giving you what you needed.

21:43.368 --> 21:47.139
I never gave myself compassion until now.

21:48.774 --> 21:52.878
And I've given myself permission to start over.

21:56.515 --> 21:59.985
I really hope that you guys can forgive me.

22:00.052 --> 22:03.955
But if you can't, I understand.

22:04.022 --> 22:04.990
And at the very least,

22:05.057 --> 22:08.460
I just hope that

22:08.527 --> 22:11.663
you can forgive yourselves.

22:13.332 --> 22:15.901
- I've waited so long to hear that.

22:17.336 --> 22:18.837
- Will you tell me something?

22:18.904 --> 22:21.540
- Of course.

22:21.640 --> 22:26.078
- Did you kill April?

22:30.382 --> 22:33.685
- Yes. -

22:33.752 --> 22:36.254
- I pushed her off the Staten Island ferry.

22:40.425 --> 22:43.729
- I mean, what you put us through was so fucked up.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.099
I don't know what I believe

22:47.199 --> 22:48.867
or what I think about enlightenment,

22:48.934 --> 22:52.037
but I know that I've been burned so many times by you.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.339
And I'm not going to fall for whatever it is

22:54.406 --> 22:56.074
that you're up to this time. Do you understand me?

22:56.174 --> 22:59.077
- I have no agenda, Drew. I promise.

22:59.177 --> 23:01.012
Except just to spread love wherever I go.

23:01.079 --> 23:05.083
I-I promise you this time that it's different.

23:06.284 --> 23:09.554
- Okay, well, that's good.

23:09.621 --> 23:12.524
- I really do hope it's different this time,

23:12.591 --> 23:16.094
because if you think about the last few years,

23:16.194 --> 23:20.132
our lives have been insane.

23:20.232 --> 23:24.202
We went to court for killing someone.

23:24.269 --> 23:25.804
Can you believe that?

23:25.904 --> 23:29.441
- You guys all convinced me to bury a body.

23:29.541 --> 23:32.778
- I mean, the craziest part of all of it is that

23:32.878 --> 23:37.783
we actually killed someone.

23:38.450 --> 23:39.785
You know, I mean,

23:39.885 --> 23:42.788
can you believe that we did that?

23:51.830 --> 23:55.400
- It's the fact that I'm not supposed to laugh.

23:55.467 --> 23:59.671
It is the sheer inappropriateness of laughter

23:59.771 --> 24:02.507
that is making me laugh.

24:02.607 --> 24:05.110
Your mouth was twinkling.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.245
Whoo!

24:07.312 --> 24:10.115
- Guys, we can't laugh. Oh, that makes you bad.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.616
- No, it's okay.

24:11.683 --> 24:13.785
We have to laugh because it's too painful, you know.

24:13.852 --> 24:15.487
And--and we can't change the past so we laugh.

24:15.587 --> 24:17.022
We have to.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.324
- It does feel good to just, you know, speak the truth.

24:19.424 --> 24:22.961
I mean, I don't feel like I can remember a time

24:23.028 --> 24:25.263
where that felt okay, you know?

24:25.330 --> 24:29.768
- I promise you that every day can feel like today.

24:31.937 --> 24:34.005
There's so much to live for.

24:34.105 --> 24:37.275
I mean, we're surrounded by love and beauty

24:37.342 --> 24:39.678
and I want you all to feel the way that I do.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.793
You don't have another toothbrush, do you?

24:54.860 --> 24:58.129
- Mm-mm. Is it weird if you use mine?

24:58.196 --> 24:59.798
- I mean, I'm the one who hasn't brushed my teeth

24:59.865 --> 25:01.132
in three weeks. - I don't mind.

25:01.199 --> 25:02.968
I really don't. - Okay, thanks.

25:03.034 --> 25:06.338
- You're welcome.

25:06.404 --> 25:07.639
Dory.

25:07.706 --> 25:10.308
- Yeah. - I'm so enchanted by you.

25:10.375 --> 25:12.143
Like, I want to be just like you.

25:12.210 --> 25:14.713
Like, I want to spread love and truth.

25:14.813 --> 25:18.216
- That is so, so sweet. And you know something?

25:18.316 --> 25:20.652
The fact that you can identify that in me,

25:20.719 --> 25:23.655
that means that that aspect you admire in me

25:23.722 --> 25:25.190
is in you.

25:25.257 --> 25:26.758
- Really? - Yeah.

25:26.858 --> 25:29.494
You're so generous with your love.

25:29.561 --> 25:31.863
And, unfortunately, that's so rare.

25:31.930 --> 25:33.865
And it means so much to me that you're willing

25:33.932 --> 25:35.500
to give me a second chance.

25:35.567 --> 25:37.335
And that you see the value in my experience.

25:37.402 --> 25:38.904
I mean, I just want to teach you

25:39.004 --> 25:41.072
everything that I've learned.

25:41.172 --> 25:42.874
And, well, I just--

25:42.941 --> 25:44.609
I just hope you know how special you are to me.

25:44.709 --> 25:46.411
You're like my sister.

25:46.511 --> 25:47.746
- I love that.

25:47.846 --> 25:50.415
Like, I-I want to be, like, your sister.

25:50.515 --> 25:52.551
Like, I'd seriously do, like,

25:52.617 --> 25:55.253
anything you ever need, like, from here on out.

25:55.353 --> 25:59.057
Like, I just--I just wanna be right by your side.

25:59.124 --> 26:00.592
- Well, I would love that.

26:07.198 --> 26:08.700
- Dory, there's something I wanna tell you.

26:08.767 --> 26:10.602
I feel like I really need to come clean about it,

26:10.702 --> 26:13.605
but I also feel really scared to tell you.

26:13.705 --> 26:15.907
- Portia, you can tell me anything.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.579
- I've been...

26:20.645 --> 26:24.149
intimate with Drew for, like, a little while now.

26:26.051 --> 26:28.086
- Oh.

26:30.722 --> 26:32.257
I think that's great.

26:32.324 --> 26:33.558
- Really? - Yeah.

26:33.625 --> 26:35.260
- Seriously, you're not mad? - No.

26:35.327 --> 26:38.296
I don't believe in this culture of--of scarcity

26:38.396 --> 26:41.232
and where people need to possess other people, you know?

26:41.299 --> 26:42.634
Love should be free.

26:42.734 --> 26:45.837
How is it? Is the sex good?

26:45.937 --> 26:50.141
- I mean, it just feels nice

26:50.241 --> 26:52.811
to be loved or something.

26:52.911 --> 26:57.682
- Well, I am so happy for you.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.985
- Thank you.

27:12.831 --> 27:16.501
- All right, Dory Sief. I took your advice,

27:16.601 --> 27:19.204
and I opened my heart to your words.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.873
And I think that you're onto something.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.842
I'd like to invite you to my office
