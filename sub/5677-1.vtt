03:35.882 --> 03:38.373
I forgot where I am.

03:38.484 --> 03:40.076
You're at the place
where the killers meet

03:40.186 --> 03:42.313
to decide what to do
with the crippled girl.

03:42.388 --> 03:44.822
Oh, that's right. That's right.

03:52.432 --> 03:54.229
Did you hear that?

03:56.869 --> 03:58.393
That's funny.

03:59.505 --> 04:03.874
That's weird. Those people look 
like they're clawing at themselves.

04:04.777 --> 04:06.404
Is that blood?

04:27.233 --> 04:29.428
Claire, are you seeing this?

04:29.535 --> 04:30.866
Claire.

04:32.305 --> 04:33.567
Claire?

04:34.774 --> 04:36.571
Claire?

04:36.643 --> 04:38.634
What page was I on?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.716
Page.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.372
- I need an extension over here.
- Fall back. Fall back.

05:13.446 --> 05:14.606
You kidding me?
Like another 20 feet.

05:14.714 --> 05:17.274
Don't touch that.
That's for the drywall guys.

05:17.383 --> 05:18.543
I told you he wouldn't do it!

05:18.618 --> 05:20.142
So then the little guy says,

05:20.253 --> 05:24.747
"You have a girlfriend named Wendy, too?
Well, I saw your thing and it said 'WY'."

05:24.891 --> 05:30.124
The big guy says, "No, man, mine says,
'Welcome to Jamaica, have a nice day."'

05:38.171 --> 05:40.435
Christ, McKenzie fell.

05:48.648 --> 05:52.448
Medic, we have a major accident
at the south side of the building.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.577
- We'll need an ambulance.
<i>- Copy.</i>

05:55.922 --> 05:57.253
Jesus.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.924
Give him some room.

06:04.097 --> 06:05.621
- Hey!
- Somebody fell!

06:05.698 --> 06:07.859
- Davis?
- Oh, my God, he just fell!

06:07.967 --> 06:11.459
Someone fell! Over that building!

06:15.375 --> 06:16.433
Oh, my God!

06:16.509 --> 06:17.601
- Watch it.
- Oh, my God!

06:17.677 --> 06:19.542
Watch it. Get out of there!

06:23.383 --> 06:25.476
- Help!
- Look out!

06:27.353 --> 06:28.786
Look out!

06:39.999 --> 06:41.796
God in heaven.

06:43.636 --> 06:45.536
Look, I don't know if you guys
have heard about this article

06:45.638 --> 06:47.538
in <i>The New York Times</i>
about honeybees vanishing?

06:48.474 --> 06:52.001
Well, apparently, honeybees are 
disappearing all over the country.

06:52.311 --> 06:54.370
Tens of millions of them.
Just disappearing.

06:54.480 --> 06:57.972
There's no bodies, no sign of them.
They're just mysteriously gone.

06:58.050 --> 07:00.143
It's scary, huh?

07:00.219 --> 07:04.656
All right, let's hear some theories
about why this might be happening.

07:04.724 --> 07:06.885
Nothing? Come on, guys.

07:08.327 --> 07:10.659
- Laura.
- Disease?

07:10.730 --> 07:13.665
Right. Could be a virus or infection.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.634
But it's all over the country.
It's a coordinated event in 24 states.

07:16.702 --> 07:19.170
It's a little tricky.

07:19.238 --> 07:20.728
- Pollution?
- Could be.

07:20.840 --> 07:23.240
I mean, we're just pumping
so much junk into the environment

07:23.342 --> 07:24.969
they're just keeling over.

07:25.044 --> 07:28.207
But there are no bodies. Keep guessing.

07:28.314 --> 07:29.804
Dylan.

07:29.882 --> 07:32.146
Global warming.

07:32.218 --> 07:36.018
Temperature goes up a fraction of a 
degree, makes them disoriented?

07:36.088 --> 07:37.350
Maybe.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.254
Jake?

07:42.695 --> 07:44.822
You don't have an opinion?

07:45.698 --> 07:49.099
You're not interested
in what happened to the bees?

07:49.502 --> 07:51.697
You should be more interested
in science, Jake.

07:51.771 --> 07:55.434
You know why?
Because your face is perfect.

07:56.509 --> 07:59.273
The problem is,
your face is perfect at 15.

07:59.378 --> 08:01.505
Now, if you were interested in science,
you would know facts

08:01.581 --> 08:04.709
like the human nose and ears
grow a fraction of an inch each year.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.274
So a perfect balance of features now

08:06.385 --> 08:08.910
might not look so perfect
five years from now.

08:09.021 --> 08:12.479
They might look downright whack
10 years from now.

08:13.759 --> 08:16.353
Come on, buddy.
Take an interest in science.

08:16.429 --> 08:19.557
What could be a reason
the bees have vanished?

08:23.669 --> 08:27.696
An act of nature and 
we'll never fully understand it.

08:27.773 --> 08:30.003
Nice answer, Jake.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.600
He's right.

08:31.711 --> 08:34.703
I mean, science will come up
with some reason to put in the books,

08:34.780 --> 08:37.111
but in the end, it'll be just a theory.

08:37.216 --> 08:42.414
We will fail to acknowledge that there are
forces at work beyond our understanding.

08:42.522 --> 08:44.387
To be a good scientist,

08:44.457 --> 08:48.086
you must have a respectful awe
for the laws of nature.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.286
Jake?

08:49.395 --> 08:51.386
How much does the human nose
grow each year?

08:51.464 --> 08:53.022
- Oh, man.
- It's minuscule, buddy, okay?

08:53.099 --> 08:55.363
Don't worry about it. You're gonna
be a heartthrob your whole life.

08:55.434 --> 08:57.698
I was just messing with you.

09:02.575 --> 09:05.772
The Dark Lord.
Don't look into her eyes.

09:10.750 --> 09:13.583
Vice Principal!
What can we do for you?

09:13.653 --> 09:17.555
I'm afraid I have to interrupt you
for a moment, Mr. Moore.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.586
Okay, guys, calm down.
I'll be right back.

09:22.495 --> 09:24.156
- What is that?
- I can't believe it.

09:24.263 --> 09:26.322
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

09:27.266 --> 09:29.257
- I've never seen anything like it before.
- What's going on?

09:29.335 --> 09:30.563
I don't know.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.669
You excused all the teachers?

09:33.773 --> 09:36.435
The administration makes us teach
with a foot of snow on the ground.

09:36.509 --> 09:38.067
What is this?

09:38.978 --> 09:41.344
- They stopped class.
- Elliot!

09:43.249 --> 09:44.580
All right.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.246
There appears to be an event happening.

09:49.455 --> 09:53.118
Central Park was just hit by
what seems to be a terrorist attack.

09:53.225 --> 09:54.556
Oh, no.

09:54.927 --> 09:57.657
They're not clear on the scale yet.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.993
It's some kind of
airborne chemical toxin

10:00.099 --> 10:03.262
that's been released
in and around the park.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.100
They said to watch
for warning signs.

10:06.172 --> 10:09.141
The first stage
is confused speech.

10:09.241 --> 10:13.837
The second stage is physical
disorientation, loss of direction.

10:13.946 --> 10:16.744
The third stage is fatal.

10:16.816 --> 10:20.115
Central Park? That's kind of odd.

10:20.186 --> 10:24.350
I spoke with the head of schools.
He said we should dismiss the students.

10:24.457 --> 10:28.325
So take your planners home
so we can get back when this is over.

10:28.427 --> 10:31.089
All right? Let's do our jobs.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.957
Hey, you guys still got to work on
your science projects for next week.

10:36.035 --> 10:38.333
What are the rules of
scientific investigation?

10:38.437 --> 10:41.838
Identify variables.
Design the experiment.

10:41.941 --> 10:46.708
Careful observation and measurement.
Interpretation of experimental data.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.512
Hey, guys?

10:52.985 --> 10:54.316
Nothing.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.216
Alacrity. With alacrity, please.

11:02.895 --> 11:07.059
My mother just called my cell again.
She's hysterical. Hysterical.

11:07.166 --> 11:11.830
I told her the probability of something
happening in Philadelphia is very low.

11:11.904 --> 11:14.464
I mean, nobody's telling us
to leave the city, right?

11:14.540 --> 11:17.998
So I threw some figures at her.
It's good to be a math teacher sometimes.

11:18.077 --> 11:21.376
You know, people are comforted
by percentages. Didn't work.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.710
She still wants us to get out of
the city and come out to her house.

11:23.816 --> 11:26.376
But she said for
you and Alma to come.

11:26.485 --> 11:28.180
Yeah, let me think
about that, okay?

11:28.554 --> 11:30.886
Did you hear about New York?

11:30.990 --> 11:32.582
Are you okay?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.853
No, I mean, are you okay?

11:34.927 --> 11:37.487
Yeah, me, too.
Listen, I want to talk about it more.

11:37.563 --> 11:39.724
Julian's mom offered for all of us to
get out of the city and stay with her.

11:39.799 --> 11:40.857
What do you think?

11:44.336 --> 11:45.826
Yo, Chris!

11:47.339 --> 11:49.671
I'll bring Jess and Evette
and I'll meet you at the station.

11:49.742 --> 11:53.234
Listen, Julian, if Alma's acting
weird, just be cool, okay?

11:53.345 --> 11:54.437
What's going on?

11:54.547 --> 11:58.506
She's acting odd.
Just don't worry about it, okay?

11:58.584 --> 11:59.915
Odd?

12:00.019 --> 12:03.921
Look, if she's acting like 
she's distant or something...

12:04.523 --> 12:05.683
What?

12:05.925 --> 12:07.790
I can't say any more.

12:08.260 --> 12:09.522
Is she leaving you?

12:09.595 --> 12:13.554
I didn't say that. It's just talk, okay?
Just relax, please?

12:15.634 --> 12:16.692
Hey.

12:17.436 --> 12:21.566
I'm going to tell you something you
should never tell your best friend.

12:21.640 --> 12:23.938
Why is everybody saying that?

12:24.143 --> 12:26.236
I saw her on your wedding day.

12:26.312 --> 12:28.610
Again with the wedding. What?

12:29.882 --> 12:32.612
I walked into a waiting room by mistake,
and she was crying.

12:32.718 --> 12:35.482
She looked up. I saw her face.

12:36.455 --> 12:38.787
She wasn't ready to jump in, Elliot.
That's not who she is.

12:38.891 --> 12:42.327
She's never going to jump in
when you need her, man.

12:42.795 --> 12:46.561
<i>So do federal, state and local</i>
<i>officials have a plan in place</i>

12:46.632 --> 12:47.656
<i>for this type of catastrophe?</i>

12:47.767 --> 12:51.225
<i>Are they utilizing all the</i>
<i>manpower or the money...</i>

13:19.665 --> 13:21.189
- Hi.
- Are you packed?

13:21.300 --> 13:22.995
- Yes.
- What are they saying?

13:23.102 --> 13:25.593
They're evacuating New York City.

13:26.705 --> 13:30.141
<i>Well, our brains come equipped</i>
<i>with a self-preservation mechanism</i>

13:30.209 --> 13:32.336
<i>to stop us from harmful actions.</i>

13:32.444 --> 13:36.642
<i>This is controlled by a combination</i>
<i>of electrochemical signals in the brain.</i>

13:36.715 --> 13:40.344
<i>The blocking of neurotransmitters</i>
<i>by certain toxins</i>

13:40.452 --> 13:44.946
<i>has been proven to cause hallucinations,</i>
<i>asphyxiation and paralysis.</i>

13:45.024 --> 13:49.290
<i>This new neurotoxin is basically</i>
<i>flipping the preservation switch,</i>

13:49.361 --> 13:52.353
<i>blocking neurotransmitters</i>
<i>in a specific order,</i>

13:52.464 --> 13:56.457
<i>causing specific self-damaging</i>
<i>and catastrophic effects.</i>

13:56.535 --> 13:58.901
<i>Just how the toxin works</i>
<i>and who the terrorists are...</i>

13:59.004 --> 14:01.063
It makes you kill yourself.

14:01.173 --> 14:05.974
Just when you thought there couldn't be
any more evil that could be invented.

14:06.045 --> 14:08.377
I'll be packed in two minutes.

14:44.416 --> 14:45.747
<i>Hello?</i>

14:54.293 --> 14:57.592
- No need to rush.
- Sir. Thank you.

14:57.696 --> 15:00.290
Sir, we need to check your suitcase.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.867
Elliot! Elliot! Elliot!

15:07.806 --> 15:10.604
<i>This just in to the</i> Eyewitness News 
<i>room and this is the latest development.</i>

15:10.743 --> 15:15.544
<i>Autopsies on the first victims confirm</i>
<i>the toxin is a natural compound.</i>

15:15.714 --> 15:19.810
<i>The attacks remain confined</i>
<i>to the New York metropolitan area.</i>

15:19.919 --> 15:21.443
<i>This is a very,
very disturbing story...</i>

15:21.553 --> 15:23.919
<i>Track three now
boarding for Harrisburg.</i>

15:23.989 --> 15:26.150
Hey, Jess. Where's Evette?

15:26.258 --> 15:29.091
She was at a shop across town,
she got stuck in traffic.

15:29.161 --> 15:30.924
- She's gonna take the next train.
- We'll wait.

15:30.996 --> 15:32.827
No, no, no. She wanted us
to get on this train with Jess.

15:32.932 --> 15:33.990
She'll feel a lot safer.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.158
- Where's Alma?
- Restroom.

15:38.570 --> 15:39.764
Hey, Julian!

15:39.838 --> 15:42.636
Please have your tickets out and ready,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:42.741 --> 15:44.140
I bought them.

15:44.243 --> 15:46.234
It was like getting one
of those Cabbage Patch Dolls

15:46.312 --> 15:47.973
when they first came out.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.809
Madhouse. How are you?

15:49.915 --> 15:52.145
- Good. You?
- Good.

15:53.585 --> 15:57.988
- Okay, good. Why don't we all...
- I'm really glad you chose to come.

15:59.858 --> 16:04.124
Thanks. Elliot, can I
talk to you for a second?

16:04.196 --> 16:05.322
Yeah.

16:07.299 --> 16:10.359
Please show me your tickets,
ladies and gentlemen.

16:10.469 --> 16:13.700
- You told him about our fight?
- No.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.001
- Why did he say that?
- He guessed.

16:16.108 --> 16:19.635
I love you, Elliot, but I don't like to put
my feelings out there for everyone to see.

16:19.712 --> 16:21.805
I'm not that type of person.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.348
Elliot, these are our problems.

16:25.517 --> 16:28.486
I am upset.
I'm going to sit alone and cool off.

16:28.554 --> 16:30.954
By the time we get there I'll be fine.
Is that okay?

16:31.023 --> 16:32.217
Fine.

16:39.031 --> 16:40.396
I'm going to get on the train.

16:40.499 --> 16:43.024
We're not gonna
get to sit together anyways.

16:43.135 --> 16:44.363
Okay.

16:48.974 --> 16:50.373
Hey, babe.

16:50.476 --> 16:52.569
- Hi, Aunt Alma.
- How you doing?

16:52.678 --> 16:55.044
- Hanging in there.
- Me, too.

16:59.551 --> 17:01.314
- What's wrong with you?
- What?

17:01.387 --> 17:03.912
You're wrong about her.
She just needs time to figure it out.

17:04.022 --> 17:05.422
Come on, don't get all sensitive.

17:05.523 --> 17:08.357
- Just give her a chance.
- Okay, fine. If you don't want my help...

17:08.426 --> 17:10.656
- I don't want your help!
- Okay. I heard it.

17:10.729 --> 17:13.993
Jess, could you ask your dad
for my ticket, please?

17:14.066 --> 17:17.092
Thank you.
I'll see you on the train, Jess.

17:17.703 --> 17:21.194
<i>Track 3 now boarding</i>
<i>all ticketed passengers.</i>

17:21.272 --> 17:22.705
Here we go.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.873
When will Mom meet us at Grandma's?

17:25.944 --> 17:29.971
Mommy's gonna get on the next train.
You know how she's always late.

17:56.442 --> 17:59.104
- Come on. Come on. I know. I know.
- Mom.

18:10.789 --> 18:13.917
- Chilly, isn't it today, Sal?
- Maybe a little.

19:21.260 --> 19:24.957
Hey, it's me. I'm on a train.
I just want to say something, okay?

19:25.030 --> 19:26.588
You've got to stop calling me.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.690
You're acting like the
<i>Fatal Attraction</i> guy, here.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.961
I feel like I'm
going to take a shower

19:31.036 --> 19:34.164
and see your silhouette
on the shower curtain.

19:34.806 --> 19:38.503
We ate tiramisu together,
that is it.

19:38.610 --> 19:42.603
I told you that would be it.
You have got to chill out.

19:45.284 --> 19:46.444
What?

19:48.053 --> 19:49.645
When?

19:49.721 --> 19:51.382
In Philadelphia?

19:51.690 --> 19:55.990
- I don't know. What did you hear?
- Oh, my God. I can't believe it.

19:56.395 --> 19:57.521
What's the news?

19:57.629 --> 20:00.564
Apparently Philadelphia
was just attacked.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.961
- Oh, my God. Evette.
- Call Mommy. Call Mommy!

20:11.743 --> 20:13.335
Honey!

20:13.412 --> 20:15.710
Honey...
Yeah, yeah, where are you?

20:15.814 --> 20:18.647
What? What?
I can't hear you.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.910
I said I can't hear you!
Text me.

20:23.755 --> 20:26.087
Text me. I can't hear you!

20:26.925 --> 20:29.689
They think it started
in Rittenhouse Square Park.

20:29.761 --> 20:31.422
Another park?

20:37.102 --> 20:39.764
- She got on a bus going to New Jersey.
- I want to talk to her.

20:39.871 --> 20:42.533
I know, baby. I know. She got out.
She's headed to the town of Princeton.

20:42.608 --> 20:44.542
I want to talk to her.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.283
- Do you have a phone?
- No, I'm sorry.

21:00.392 --> 21:02.451
- You okay?
- They say Boston got hit, too.

21:02.561 --> 21:05.359
- Where'd you hear that?
- A friend from work. What about Evette?

21:05.430 --> 21:07.398
Oh, God. She made it out on a bus.

21:07.466 --> 21:10.094
What the hell is going on, Elliot?

21:12.437 --> 21:14.371
I honestly don't know.

21:39.831 --> 21:41.162
Now what?

21:41.433 --> 21:44.095
It just stopped. I don't know.

21:44.403 --> 21:46.098
- Can't go nowhere.
- They're not telling us anything.

21:46.171 --> 21:48.571
- Well, until we hear from...
- Sir?

21:48.640 --> 21:50.164
Train service has
been discontinued.

21:50.275 --> 21:53.574
This will be the last stop
for all passengers.

21:53.645 --> 21:56.512
Hey! What do you mean?
Where are we?

21:58.116 --> 21:59.481
Filbert, Pennsylvania.

21:59.584 --> 22:02.815
Filbert?
Does anybody know where that is?

22:02.921 --> 22:05.685
Why are you giving me one useless
piece of information at a time?

22:05.791 --> 22:07.452
What's going on?

22:07.526 --> 22:10.791
Hey, why would you just stop?
You can't just leave us here.

22:10.862 --> 22:14.263
Sir, we lost contact.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.800
With whom?

22:18.370 --> 22:19.803
Everyone.

22:22.107 --> 22:24.837
I'm scared. I don't like it here.
I want Mom.

22:24.943 --> 22:27.776
Don't be silly.
We're safe here, okay?

22:31.883 --> 22:35.046
Sorry. She whispers to us
when she gets scared.

22:36.488 --> 22:41.050
We're so much the same, Jess.
I don't like to show my emotions, either.

22:42.494 --> 22:43.688
She's shivering.

22:43.795 --> 22:46.355
I know. I know.
She's never right without her mom.

22:46.465 --> 22:47.557
It's okay.

22:47.666 --> 22:49.224
They're not saying anything.

22:49.334 --> 22:51.063
We're stuck here.

22:52.904 --> 22:54.667
Is Jess okay?

22:54.740 --> 22:56.537
She's not talking.

22:57.342 --> 23:01.403
We're in a small town, Jess.
Nothing will happen to us here.

23:11.857 --> 23:12.915
Don't know what you want?

23:13.024 --> 23:14.719
Then just have the grilled cheese
plain with milk, okay?

23:14.826 --> 23:15.884
Come on, come over here.

23:15.994 --> 23:17.154
No, you know what?
Why don't you stay here?

23:17.229 --> 23:20.027
Stay here, all right?
You can see me from over there.

23:20.098 --> 23:21.190
What?
All right, you want to come with me?

23:21.266 --> 23:23.029
You can come with me and wait in line.
You want to do that?

23:23.101 --> 23:25.899
Bro! Bro, I got it.
Go get the milk.

23:26.004 --> 23:28.996
All right, yeah. Okay.

23:34.212 --> 23:37.204
You know that everyone
gives off energy, right?

23:37.282 --> 23:39.273
It's scientifically proven.

23:39.384 --> 23:41.511
They got these cameras
that can record what color you are

23:41.586 --> 23:43.451
when you're feeling different things.

23:43.555 --> 23:48.015
People that are angry give off a
different color than people that are sad.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.720
See this ring?

23:49.795 --> 23:53.731
This ring can supposedly tell you
what you're feeling.

23:53.799 --> 23:56.700
Let's see what
you're feeling right now.

24:00.972 --> 24:05.238
Yellow! That's cool.
That means you're about to laugh.

24:05.977 --> 24:08.070
I'm not making it up.
That's what yellow means.

24:08.146 --> 24:09.579
You must be about
to laugh or something.

24:09.648 --> 24:12.742
It's probably just
about to come out.

24:12.818 --> 24:14.308
We'll wait.

24:15.487 --> 24:17.148
We got all day.

24:20.559 --> 24:25.087
Oh, my God. There it is! Cool.
That ring really works. That's amazing.

24:25.163 --> 24:28.291
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Look at this.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.561
My sister sent it to me.

24:30.635 --> 24:34.002
It was taken an hour ago
at the Philadelphia Zoo.

25:06.304 --> 25:09.705
Mother of God,
what kind of terrorists are these?

25:25.624 --> 25:28.115
They're not sure it's terrorists now.

25:28.193 --> 25:30.024
<i>Moments ago,
in an official statement,</i>

25:30.128 --> 25:32.562
<i>the government moved away</i>
<i>from its initial position</i>

25:32.664 --> 25:34.689
<i>that this was a
terrorist attack.</i>

25:34.799 --> 25:36.130
<i>Authorities are now feeling,</i>

25:36.201 --> 25:38.726
<i>by the sheer number</i>
<i>of incidents being reported,</i>

25:38.837 --> 25:43.865
<i>that a terrorist group being responsible</i>
<i>is becoming less and less likely.</i>

25:43.975 --> 25:46.637
<i>The event appears to be</i>
<i>limited to the Northeast,</i>

25:46.711 --> 25:49.839
<i>where smaller and smaller towns</i>
<i>are being attacked.</i>

25:49.915 --> 25:50.973
Where are we?

25:51.049 --> 25:52.983
<i>The infected area now</i>
<i>includes most of New England,</i>

25:53.051 --> 25:54.882
<i>from Massachusetts to Maryland.</i>

25:54.986 --> 25:56.248
We're dead center.

25:58.924 --> 26:00.585
Everything okay?

26:11.269 --> 26:15.205
If we stay here,
we are gonna die here.

26:18.276 --> 26:23.270
Whatever this is, it looks like it's
not occurring about 90 miles from here.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.581
Let's go.

26:30.055 --> 26:33.115
Anyone got a car?
Can anyone give us a ride?

26:46.438 --> 26:47.564
Hey!

26:56.481 --> 26:58.312
Excuse me, sir?

26:58.416 --> 26:59.747
Sir, could we get a ride, please?

26:59.818 --> 27:02.116
We don't have any transportation.
We're stuck here.

27:02.220 --> 27:04.620
Sir, did you hear what I said?
We don't have any transportation!

27:04.723 --> 27:07.590
- We have a little girl with us. Please.
- Drive. Just roll up the window.

27:07.659 --> 27:10.492
Sir! You're not just going to...

27:14.933 --> 27:17.731
Can you believe
how crappy people are?

27:23.308 --> 27:24.639
There's a car.

27:26.111 --> 27:28.978
Hi. I run a plant
nursery up the street.

27:29.080 --> 27:31.981
We're picking up a few things from home,
then heading

27:32.984 --> 27:34.918
wherever this isn't happening.

27:34.986 --> 27:36.112
We have room.

27:36.187 --> 27:37.950
- We have two others.
- That's okay.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.757
Julian!

27:41.626 --> 27:43.287
Is Julian okay?

27:50.802 --> 27:53.965
We got a ride. He can fit all of us.

27:54.039 --> 27:57.975
Elliot, I can't get Evette on
the phone or e-mail or nothing.

27:58.043 --> 28:00.637
- How long?
- It's been about two hours.

28:00.712 --> 28:03.613
She was on that
bus headed to Princeton.

28:05.050 --> 28:07.018
There's a car over there headed 
to pick up friends and family,

28:07.118 --> 28:09.882
they said they
could squeeze one more.

28:11.790 --> 28:13.348
We got to go.

28:14.459 --> 28:17.394
Look, think real carefully about this.

28:17.495 --> 28:19.326
She was looking
for a birthday present for Jess.

28:19.397 --> 28:23.060
Some kind of dollhouse.
That's why she wasn't with us.

28:23.168 --> 28:25.329
I'm just gonna go get her
and I want to bring her back,

28:25.403 --> 28:28.167
and then I'm gonna find you guys.

28:28.239 --> 28:30.901
I just...
I need you to take Jess, okay?

28:31.910 --> 28:34.538
She's gonna be
a lot safer with you.

28:34.913 --> 28:36.744
Don't do this to me.

28:37.382 --> 28:40.249
I'm doing my best
here not to fall down.

28:41.519 --> 28:45.011
I'm sure the probability of
Princeton not being hit is good.

28:45.090 --> 28:46.182
Yeah.

28:46.257 --> 28:48.088
You want me to throw some
figures and percentages at you

28:48.193 --> 28:49.319
so we both feel better?

28:49.394 --> 28:51.225
- Please.
- All right.

28:51.329 --> 28:55.390
62% chance.
62% chance it hasn't even been hit.

28:55.500 --> 28:57.593
- Well, you go get her, Jules, okay?
- Of course, man, of course.

28:57.702 --> 28:59.192
Come on.
This is all some weird event, that's all.

28:59.270 --> 29:03.229
We're all gonna be fine.
I'm gonna find you guys real soon.

29:05.176 --> 29:06.700
I have to go.

29:07.779 --> 29:08.939
I got her, Julian.

29:09.047 --> 29:12.346
Don't take my daughter's hand
unless you mean it.

29:17.889 --> 29:20.050
I'm going to go get Mommy.

29:21.126 --> 29:22.889
Hold our picture.

30:17.515 --> 30:20.643
Take a look around.
We'll be ready in a jiffy.

30:37.502 --> 30:40.335
We're packing
hot dogs for the road.

30:40.438 --> 30:42.929
You know, hot dogs get a bad rap.

30:43.007 --> 30:45.771
They've got a cool shape,
they've got protein.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.869
You like hot dogs, right?

30:50.014 --> 30:53.313
By the way,
I think I know what's causing this.

30:54.953 --> 30:57.319
- You do?
- It's the plants.

30:57.388 --> 30:59.618
They can release chemicals.

31:01.626 --> 31:04.186
You like hot dogs, don't you?

31:07.665 --> 31:12.898
Okay, babies, we are gonna be going,
but we will be back soon, okay?

31:14.973 --> 31:18.966
Oh, plants react to human stimulus.
They've proved it in tests.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.413
Did you get the mustard?

32:09.861 --> 32:12.625
Don't look outside. Stop it!

32:12.730 --> 32:16.063
Stop it! Just look at me!
Just keep looking at me!

32:19.137 --> 32:20.798
Close the vents.

32:26.210 --> 32:30.271
I'm gonna give you a math riddle, okay?
And you're gonna tell me the answer.

32:30.381 --> 32:31.575
What?

32:33.251 --> 32:37.381
How much would you have if I said
I would pay you a penny on the first day

32:37.455 --> 32:40.117
and then two pennies on the second,
and then four pennies on the third day

32:40.224 --> 32:42.215
and I just kept doubling it
and I did this for a month?

32:42.293 --> 32:45.558
How much money would you have
at the end of the month?

32:46.564 --> 32:48.998
- Ten dollars.
- No, higher. Higher, higher.

32:49.100 --> 32:52.297
Just keep looking at me.
Just keep looking at me.

32:54.238 --> 32:55.432
Twenty dollars?

32:55.506 --> 32:57.770
No, keep going. Keep going.

33:06.918 --> 33:10.251
Thirty. It's thirty. It's $30.

33:20.098 --> 33:22.658
I'm gonna tell you the answer.

33:22.767 --> 33:25.327
It's over $10 million.

33:25.436 --> 33:28.872
You'd have over $10 million
at the end of the month.

33:32.944 --> 33:35.469
You want to hear another one?

34:36.440 --> 34:39.534
<i>Water contamination has surfaced</i>
<i>as one of the many theories</i>

34:39.610 --> 34:44.513
<i>being taken seriously as to the cause</i>
<i>of the events in the Northeast.</i>

34:44.581 --> 34:46.708
We have to go through
this little community of homes.

34:46.784 --> 34:48.911
Small town called Holcomb,
then we hit the highway.

34:49.020 --> 34:52.284
From there,
we're 30 miles from the state line.

34:55.359 --> 34:57.850
Are those dead animals up ahead?

35:00.598 --> 35:02.122
Stop the car.

35:07.572 --> 35:10.268
- You don't think it's...
- I don't know.

35:10.374 --> 35:15.107
You got binoculars in the back, from
when you were spying on our neighbors.

35:26.424 --> 35:27.891
Can I have the map?

35:27.959 --> 35:29.756
Elliot...

35:29.827 --> 35:31.658
Don't cause a panic, okay?
Jess can hear you.

35:31.762 --> 35:34.060
It's bodies, isn't it?
I knew it would be bodies.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.292
How could it not be bodies?

35:35.399 --> 35:37.594
Please, give me the map.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.581
Well, we have to turn around.

35:51.649 --> 35:53.583
There's a right turn
about a quarter of a mile back.

35:53.651 --> 35:57.178
We're just gonna take a different route,
honey, okay?

36:17.508 --> 36:19.840
Oh, it's the Army. We're safe!

36:28.653 --> 36:29.881
My name is Private Auster.

36:29.987 --> 36:33.650
I'm stationed at West Dover Military Base,
about 10 miles back.

36:33.724 --> 36:35.715
I think they've been affected
by whatever's happening.

36:35.826 --> 36:37.623
I lost communication with them.

36:37.695 --> 36:38.821
When I approached the base,

36:38.896 --> 36:44.528
I saw military personnel
in the barbed wire, in the fence.

36:44.635 --> 36:46.034
So I suggest no one take that road.

36:46.137 --> 36:47.798
There's a town
about eight miles behind us.

36:47.872 --> 36:50.739
There were bodies on the road into town.

36:52.810 --> 36:54.801
Cheese and crackers.

36:55.713 --> 36:58.705
Well, that still
leaves us two directions.

37:02.053 --> 37:05.147
Just stop! Stop the vehicle!

37:06.224 --> 37:07.987
- What's going on?
- Is everyone all right?

37:08.059 --> 37:09.856
We have no communication with anybody.

37:11.562 --> 37:13.928
- I'll talk to them.
- Did you see anything out of the ordinary?

37:15.766 --> 37:18.064
Hello! Please stop!

37:19.403 --> 37:20.768
Excuse me.

37:26.410 --> 37:27.775
Who's Joey?

37:27.945 --> 37:29.708
Oh, it's no one.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.745
Any luck?

37:34.852 --> 37:36.444
I can't get Julian
on his cell phone.

37:36.554 --> 37:39.717
I'm sure he'll be all right.
They'll be okay.

37:40.691 --> 37:43.785
Has anyone seen any other people
on the roads?

37:44.061 --> 37:46.291
Maybe he's on to something.

37:47.732 --> 37:51.259
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

37:51.369 --> 37:53.462
Why did it start in parks?

37:54.438 --> 37:56.804
It's the same story.
About eight, nine miles back.

37:56.907 --> 37:59.603
They say there's a bus in a lake.

38:01.879 --> 38:05.440
Five miles back.
There were dozens of bodies.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.591
Okay.

38:15.326 --> 38:20.161
Nobody's going anywhere.
We're gonna stay right here for a while.

38:29.940 --> 38:31.635
There's a woman
talking to her daughter.

38:31.742 --> 38:33.232
She's talking to her 
daughter in Princeton.

38:33.311 --> 38:35.506
Isn't that where your friend went?

38:35.613 --> 38:37.080
Come on.

38:42.486 --> 38:45.978
It's okay.
Honey, it's okay.

38:46.824 --> 38:48.018
She's so scared.

38:48.125 --> 38:53.324
You just stay in that room.
You don't open the door for nothing.

38:53.431 --> 38:55.661
Just keep watching out the window
with the tree, baby.

38:55.766 --> 38:57.324
Someone will come and get you soon.

38:57.435 --> 39:00.700
Tell her not to go near the window
with the tree. Just tell her.

39:00.805 --> 39:02.705
Baby, don't go near the window
with the tree.

39:02.807 --> 39:04.434
Ask her if Princeton's been affected.

39:04.508 --> 39:08.842
Honey, someone wants to know
if Princeton's had any problems.

39:11.615 --> 39:14.277
She says everyone's dead outside.

39:15.319 --> 39:17.810
You just stay in your room.

39:18.956 --> 39:20.116
Honey?

39:21.325 --> 39:23.793
Honey, you're talking funny.
What's wrong with you?

39:23.861 --> 39:26.523
- What do you mean? Everyone's dead?
- What?

39:26.630 --> 39:30.157
Stacy... Stacy, you're scaring me.

39:30.234 --> 39:33.226
I don't understand what you're saying.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.532
What, baby?

39:35.639 --> 39:38.631
She's just not making any sense.

39:38.709 --> 39:40.199
<i>Calculus.</i>

39:40.311 --> 39:43.212
<i>I see in calculus.</i>

39:44.181 --> 39:45.671
<i>Calculus.</i>

39:45.750 --> 39:47.843
- Stacy!
<i>- Calculus.</i>

39:47.918 --> 39:49.476
Stacy!

39:51.522 --> 39:53.183
Stacy Ann!

39:53.724 --> 39:54.918
Oh, my God.

39:56.994 --> 40:01.226
- I hear wind from outside.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

40:01.332 --> 40:04.165
Stacy, Stacy, Stacy.

40:06.904 --> 40:08.428
Oh, no!

40:23.354 --> 40:26.517
We're going to go back to the car,
okay, Jess?

40:31.896 --> 40:35.093
If we went down that road,
where would that take us?

41:31.422 --> 41:34.050
I walked down a quarter mile,
it was clean.

41:34.124 --> 41:38.083
I can't tell you what's after that,
but it was clean, no bodies, no nothing.

41:38.162 --> 41:40.790
- Quarter mile?
- That's not enough.

41:40.898 --> 41:43.799
Hey, it's better than going back
the other way.

41:44.268 --> 41:48.671
Get a battle plan.
Everybody makes a clean break.

41:48.772 --> 41:51.104
Elliot's resilient, isn't he?

41:53.611 --> 41:55.806
Yeah. He never gives up.

41:57.815 --> 42:01.273
You know, plants have the ability
to target specific threats.

42:01.352 --> 42:04.014
Tobacco plants,
when attacked by Heliothis caterpillars

42:04.121 --> 42:09.081
will send out a chemical attracting
wasps to kill just those caterpillars.

42:09.159 --> 42:10.820
We don't know how plants
attain these abilities.

42:10.928 --> 42:14.193
They just evolve very rapidly.

42:14.298 --> 42:18.496
Which species do you think is
doing it if you think it's true?

42:18.602 --> 42:21.867
Plants have the ability to communicate
with other species of plants.

42:21.972 --> 42:23.837
Trees can communicate with bushes,

42:23.941 --> 42:27.001
bushes with grass
and everything in between.

42:28.979 --> 42:32.710
The radio says these attacks
started happening in the cities

42:32.816 --> 42:35.376
then went to the towns
and now the roads.

42:35.486 --> 42:37.044
That's right.

42:37.154 --> 42:40.954
Whatever's happening is happening
to smaller and smaller populations.

42:41.025 --> 42:43.118
So we shouldn't be on the roads, then.

42:43.193 --> 42:47.220
The terrorists, or whatever
could be watching the roads.

42:50.501 --> 42:53.664
I don't have any reason
to disagree right now.

42:55.906 --> 42:57.965
We are in the area of attack.

42:58.042 --> 43:01.569
If you can't find a way
through the area of attack

43:01.679 --> 43:06.639
we are told to find a safe zone
within the area being attacked.

43:06.717 --> 43:09.311
They're attacking populations.

43:09.386 --> 43:12.082
We need to go where there
aren't that many people.

43:12.189 --> 43:14.316
Where people don't travel.

43:14.391 --> 43:18.987
Now this is Mr. Collins.
He's a realtor that works in this area.

43:20.698 --> 43:23.758
If we go west,
we'll hit a county called Arundell.

43:23.867 --> 43:25.391
It's not on that map.

43:25.502 --> 43:30.337
It would only be on local maps. Dirt roads.
Hardly anybody lives out there.

43:31.208 --> 43:35.372
There's no significant population there.
That's our safe zone.

43:35.446 --> 43:40.110
We wait it out there till it's over.
Is everyone in agreement?

43:42.886 --> 43:44.547
We should go into two groups.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.283
Those that are
ready to go right now

43:46.390 --> 43:48.790
and those that need
to get things from their cars.

43:48.892 --> 43:52.384
We need to stay in groups.
Stay together.

43:55.399 --> 43:57.890
We'll go soon, honey.
We'll go soon.

44:02.206 --> 44:03.537
Maybe we should've waited
for the rest of them,

44:03.607 --> 44:06.770
stayed in a big group,
like the Private said.

44:07.544 --> 44:09.409
Your phone's out, too?

44:12.816 --> 44:14.306
What's wrong?

44:15.819 --> 44:18.117
Okay. I was going to tell you, okay?

44:18.222 --> 44:20.554
There was this guy, Joey.

44:20.624 --> 44:21.989
His name is Joey.
He's at work.

44:22.092 --> 44:23.719
We went out and we had dessert.

44:23.794 --> 44:26.592
I went out and I had dessert with him
when I told you I worked late.

44:26.664 --> 44:27.926
And I didn't work late.

44:27.998 --> 44:29.829
I'm feeling really guilty
in case we're gonna die.

44:29.933 --> 44:32.299
I just wanted you to know that.

44:34.171 --> 44:35.763
You lied to me?

44:46.617 --> 44:49.347
- How much farther is it?
- I don't know.

45:00.831 --> 45:02.992
- We need to keep going forward.
- Who the hell made you boss?

45:03.100 --> 45:06.934
Look, if y'all follow him, y'all gonna die.
You follow me, you're gonna live.

45:07.004 --> 45:11.100
I'm in charge of this group!
Ain't nobody else in charge of this group!

45:11.175 --> 45:15.669
My firearm is my friend!
It will not leave my side!

45:16.680 --> 45:18.341
Private Auster?

45:21.618 --> 45:23.950
My firearm is my friend.

46:00.691 --> 46:01.988
Jesus.

46:06.330 --> 46:07.888
Oh, no.

46:07.998 --> 46:09.522
What, "Oh, no"?

46:13.504 --> 46:14.994
The toxin?

46:18.075 --> 46:20.441
The toxin is affecting them?

46:20.544 --> 46:22.569
Are those people killing themselves?

46:22.679 --> 46:24.408
You were with the Private.
What do we do?

46:24.515 --> 46:27.609
- We need to do something!
- Just let me think.

46:29.686 --> 46:31.415
- They're dying!
- I need a second.

46:31.522 --> 46:34.082
They released it?
We're not near the roads.

46:34.191 --> 46:36.591
We can't just stand here
as uninvolved observers!

46:36.693 --> 46:38.058
I need a second, okay.
Just give me a second!

46:38.128 --> 46:40.392
We are not going to be
one of those assholes on the news

46:40.464 --> 46:42.364
who watches a crime happen
and not do something!

46:42.432 --> 46:44.297
- We're not assholes!
- Just a second!

46:44.401 --> 46:45.595
There were children in that group!

46:45.702 --> 46:48.432
- Elliot, please tell us what to do.
- I need a second, okay!

46:48.539 --> 46:51.770
Why can't anybody
give me a goddamn second?

46:51.875 --> 46:53.433
All right, be scientific, douchebag.

46:53.544 --> 46:56.479
Identify the variables.
That's the two groups.

46:56.580 --> 46:59.606
Design an experiment.
That's what we're in.

46:59.716 --> 47:02.651
Careful observation and measurements.
That's what I'm trying to do.

47:02.753 --> 47:05.745
Interpret the experimental data.
Interpret.

47:08.225 --> 47:10.318
What if it is the plants?

47:11.461 --> 47:13.929
Their group was larger than ours.

47:13.997 --> 47:15.988
This thing has been escalating all day.

47:16.099 --> 47:18.897
Smaller and smaller populations
have been setting this off.

47:18.969 --> 47:21.301
They react to human stimulus.

47:22.673 --> 47:24.573
Maybe people are
setting off the plants?

47:24.641 --> 47:27.132
What are you saying? That guy was crazy.
We have to save them.

47:27.244 --> 47:29.474
They're already dead.

47:29.580 --> 47:32.105
What if they're
targeting us as threats?

47:32.182 --> 47:36.312
This part of the field
may not have been set off.

47:36.420 --> 47:39.184
Something in this field could be
releasing the chemical into the air

47:39.289 --> 47:42.190
when there's too
many of us together.

47:43.927 --> 47:46.452
Let's just stay
ahead of the wind.

48:02.880 --> 48:05.348
Let's just break up into groups.

48:14.291 --> 48:18.489
Come on! Come on! This way!
Come on, follow me!

48:21.298 --> 48:25.359
I'm right here! Keep going!
I'm right behind you!

48:33.977 --> 48:35.638
Here it comes!

48:37.381 --> 48:39.713
Don't you let go of my hand.

49:31.868 --> 49:33.927
Nothing happened.

49:34.037 --> 49:36.870
It's the size of the groups,
I think.

49:37.107 --> 49:39.075
Could this really be happening?

49:42.946 --> 49:44.311
What are your names?

49:44.414 --> 49:46.974
- Jared.
- Josh.

49:47.084 --> 49:48.551
Wait, wait!

50:03.633 --> 50:07.592
I'm going to go see if that truck
has a map. You guys wait here.

50:33.363 --> 50:35.854
<i>Why aren't they looking</i>
<i>into nuclear power plants?</i>

50:35.966 --> 50:38.332
<i>There are 15 or more</i>
<i>in the Northeast alone.</i>

50:38.435 --> 50:40.801
<i>More than anywhere else</i>
<i>in the United States.</i>

50:40.871 --> 50:43.431
<i>There's probably been</i>
<i>some leak or something.</i>

50:43.507 --> 50:45.941
<i>It's probably poisoning the air.</i>

50:53.717 --> 50:56.447
There's a house over there! Come on!

50:59.990 --> 51:01.480
It could have been
some terrorist booby-trap,

51:01.558 --> 51:03.355
someone stepped on
it out in the field.

51:03.460 --> 51:05.485
Yeah, in a field
in Bumbletown, Pennsylvania.

51:05.562 --> 51:07.189
I don't know.

51:08.465 --> 51:12.367
Look, a toxin dissipates quickly in the air.
They're only potent in a certain density.

51:12.469 --> 51:16.030
The source had to be close to that field,
if not in the field.

51:16.139 --> 51:17.663
Here's one.

51:18.341 --> 51:24.041
Plants have the chemistry to do this.
They release co-transporters into the air.

51:24.247 --> 51:26.306
You think it could be plants?

51:26.383 --> 51:27.975
I don't know.

51:28.385 --> 51:31.149
But if it is, and people are
setting it off in groups,

51:31.221 --> 51:34.384
we need to go to the least
populated place we can to be safe.

51:34.491 --> 51:37.824
We can't walk to the borders where this
isn't happening, Alma. It's too far.

51:37.894 --> 51:42.228
Whatever it is, terrorists,
a nuclear leak, plants,

51:42.332 --> 51:45.733
it's probably safe to get
away from people right now.

51:45.836 --> 51:48.566
That must be Arundell.
It's 10 miles from here.

51:48.672 --> 51:51.903
Okay, this place must have a bathroom.
I'm gonna take Jess, then we can leave.

51:52.008 --> 51:53.373
Hurry.

52:08.925 --> 52:10.222
Hello?

52:11.194 --> 52:13.185
My name is Elliot Moore.

52:14.865 --> 52:17.732
I'm just going to talk
in a very positive manner.

52:17.801 --> 52:20.599
Giving off good vibes.

52:20.704 --> 52:25.539
We're just here to use the bathroom
and then we're just gonna leave.

52:25.609 --> 52:27.543
I hope that's okay.

52:36.219 --> 52:37.550
Plastic.

52:38.421 --> 52:40.912
I'm talking to a plastic plant.

52:42.425 --> 52:44.256
I'm still doing it.

52:47.964 --> 52:49.898
You guys ready to leave?

52:49.966 --> 52:53.959
These people must have left in a hurry.
I mean, leaving the front door unlocked?

52:54.070 --> 52:56.061
Hey, everything's fake.

53:16.092 --> 53:18.322
Why is this happening?

53:18.428 --> 53:20.487
I don't know for sure, Josh.

53:20.597 --> 53:23.430
But I read this article
about the coast of Australia.

53:23.500 --> 53:27.163
It said they found large quantities
of a primordial bacteria.

53:27.270 --> 53:30.603
It hadn't been around for billions
of years, it just appeared in the water.

53:30.674 --> 53:34.440
It's toxic to humans, fishermen
who come in contact with it are dying.

53:34.511 --> 53:35.808
It feels kind of similar to that.

53:35.879 --> 53:40.145
With the bees disappearing, I mean,
I don't know, it feels like a pattern.

53:40.951 --> 53:42.612
The nature of events
like the one in Australia

53:42.686 --> 53:45.348
is that they crest and then stop.

53:45.455 --> 53:48.618
We just have to be
alive when it's over.

53:48.692 --> 53:51.456
I don't believe it's nature.

53:51.528 --> 53:55.828
It may not be. There could be some
other explanation. I don't know.

53:57.734 --> 53:59.201
Let's go.

53:59.869 --> 54:01.359
There are people coming!

54:01.471 --> 54:05.407
We can't stay here. It's close to the roads.
More and more people will come here.

54:21.191 --> 54:23.819
There's two groups coming together.

54:25.028 --> 54:27.588
There's too many of them together.

54:28.698 --> 54:30.359
Run. Run.

55:14.944 --> 55:17.139
- Is she your kid?
- No.

55:17.247 --> 55:19.374
- You got kids?
- No.

55:19.449 --> 55:21.144
How come? You got a problem?

55:21.251 --> 55:24.118
No. She wanted to wait.

55:24.220 --> 55:25.881
Really? For what?

55:25.955 --> 55:29.083
Me to grow up.
Why are we talking about this?

55:31.561 --> 55:34.621
Sweet. I used to love those.
Can I see it?

55:36.399 --> 55:40.301
You need to take personal responsibility
for yourself in a relationship.

55:40.403 --> 55:42.963
- That'll make a difference.
- Okay. Thank you.

55:43.073 --> 55:46.167
Hey, that's not a toy.
It's got meaning to me.

55:47.777 --> 55:50.803
- Elliot! Look!
- Come on.

55:54.017 --> 55:55.075
Oh, wow.

56:01.424 --> 56:03.119
<i>... is an emergency broadcast.</i>

56:03.193 --> 56:06.788
<i>All those who are still inside</i>
<i>the affected area of the Northeast</i>

56:06.863 --> 56:10.924
<i>are asked to proceed to the police</i>
<i>borders west of your state.</i>

56:11.601 --> 56:12.659
Come on.

56:12.769 --> 56:15.101
<i>This is an emergency broadcast.</i>

56:16.606 --> 56:18.972
<i>... inside the affected area...</i>

56:25.982 --> 56:29.008
Jess needs a 10-minute rest
and some food.

56:36.459 --> 56:38.791
Are you sure?
We should keep going.

56:38.862 --> 56:41.695
I know, but she's only eight.

56:44.367 --> 56:45.994
What?

56:46.069 --> 56:48.697
If we're going to die,
I want you to know something.

56:48.805 --> 56:50.864
I was in the pharmacy a while ago,

56:50.974 --> 56:53.966
and there was a really good-looking
pharmacist behind the counter.

56:54.043 --> 56:55.635
Really good-looking.

56:55.712 --> 56:58.203
And I went up and I asked her
where the cough syrup was.

56:58.314 --> 57:00.544
I didn't even have a cough.

57:00.650 --> 57:02.811
And I almost bought it.

57:02.886 --> 57:06.481
And I'm talking about a completely
superfluous bottle of cough syrup.

57:06.556 --> 57:08.820
That's like six bucks.

57:10.360 --> 57:12.021
Are you joking?

57:19.169 --> 57:20.659
Thank you.

57:51.734 --> 57:55.693
- Maybe that's not a good idea.
- I told her just for a minute.

58:01.478 --> 58:03.241
Mr. Moore,
I think I can open this door.

58:03.313 --> 58:05.975
Wait. We're a gang now?
We're gonna take whatever we want?

58:06.082 --> 58:07.913
- Come on, guys.
- Listen, nobody's home.

58:07.984 --> 58:09.611
We're just gonna
get some food for Jess.

58:09.719 --> 58:12.153
Yeah, and it looks like nobody's
lived here for a long time anyway.

58:12.255 --> 58:14.120
I mean, it's all boarded up.

58:14.224 --> 58:16.658
Maybe we could leave some money.

58:20.096 --> 58:24.089
- What kind of tree is this?
- I think it's a maple.

58:25.101 --> 58:26.966
Not so high.

58:27.070 --> 58:29.561
Okay, Josh, open the door.

58:30.240 --> 58:31.673
Wait!

58:32.609 --> 58:34.941
I see something.

58:35.011 --> 58:36.842
- There's somebody in there!
- You sure?

58:36.946 --> 58:38.811
Yeah, I saw him move.

58:40.283 --> 58:41.773
I see him!

58:43.453 --> 58:44.920
Let's stop.

58:47.824 --> 58:51.658
Is there any way we could get some food?
We have a little girl.

58:51.761 --> 58:54.252
- We just want to get her some food.
- You best leave now.

58:54.330 --> 58:56.298
You ain't gonna bring that
poison gas in here with you.

58:56.366 --> 58:59.164
Sir, it's not poison gas.
There's none out here.

58:59.269 --> 59:02.500
- They said to stay inside.
- We're fine right now.

59:02.605 --> 59:04.596
Nothing's happened out here yet.

59:04.674 --> 59:07.871
I mean, you can see that.
Just listen to our voices.

59:07.977 --> 59:09.968
We're perfectly normal.

59:11.214 --> 59:13.478
<i>Old black water,
keep on rolling</i>

59:13.550 --> 59:17.042
<i>Mississippi moon</i>
<i>Won't you keep on shining on me?</i>

59:17.287 --> 59:19.187
See? We're normal.

59:22.125 --> 59:25.390
You ain't from around here.
You'd best leave now.

59:25.495 --> 59:27.554
Okay. It's not worth it.

59:28.498 --> 59:29.829
Open the door, bitch!

59:29.899 --> 59:33.494
Hey, Josh, don't do that.
He didn't mean that!

59:33.570 --> 59:37.666
- There's more than one in there.
- Jess! Jess, come here.

59:37.740 --> 59:41.506
Stop it, Jess. Listen, we just want some
food for a little girl, you pussies!

59:41.578 --> 59:44.012
- Jess, come here.
- Josh, stop it.

59:45.648 --> 59:47.172
You'd best not let that gas in here.

59:47.250 --> 59:50.481
Sir, the air is fine out here right now.
You don't need to worry.

59:50.553 --> 59:55.252
- You might be with the terrorists!
- I don't think it's terrorists, sir.

59:55.358 --> 59:58.327
- Josh, stop it!
- They're being crazy, Mr. Moore!

59:58.394 --> 01:00:00.521
- Show your faces!
- Let the gas in...

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:02.064
No!

01:00:16.346 --> 01:00:18.405
Jared!

01:00:34.097 --> 01:00:36.930
We're gonna get
out of this nightmare.

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:46.408
Elliot!

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:55.414
We have to go.
We have to protect Jess.

01:00:56.085 --> 01:00:57.245
Okay?

01:01:01.891 --> 01:01:04.826
You've got to three
to get off our porch!

01:01:11.501 --> 01:01:12.991
Come here.

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:20.140
<i>No new people have crossed</i>
<i>over the border for a few hours.</i>

01:01:20.243 --> 01:01:24.111
<i>It appears those residents that are still</i>
<i>in the affected area of the Northeast</i>

01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:25.477
<i>are trying to wait it out.</i>

01:01:25.581 --> 01:01:27.879
<i>We have Professor Kendel Wallace</i>
<i>of Carnegie Mellon,</i>

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:31.078
<i>a statistician, here with us.</i>
<i>Professor, what can you tell us?</i>

01:01:31.287 --> 01:01:34.688
<i>Calculating by the rise in</i>
<i>intensity of reports of incidents</i>

01:01:34.757 --> 01:01:39.490
<i>within the affected area,</i>
<i>one can guess at a crude timetable.</i>

01:01:39.595 --> 01:01:43.031
<i>One can see the incident</i>
<i>is rising in sensitivity.</i>

01:01:43.332 --> 01:01:46.927
<i>We've seen fewer and fewer people</i>
<i>can provoke the attacks.</i>

01:01:47.503 --> 01:01:51.599
<i>The event should be at its most</i>
<i>sensitive tomorrow morning.</i>

01:01:51.674 --> 01:01:55.508
<i>Typically, these type of slopes</i>
<i>drop precipitously after cresting,</i>

01:01:55.611 --> 01:01:59.843
<i>meaning it could end suddenly,</i>
<i>at any moment.</i>

01:01:59.949 --> 01:02:02.679
<i>Of course,
these are only probabilities.</i>

01:02:02.785 --> 01:02:04.047
<i>There are some quiet rumblings</i>

01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:06.815
<i>that the government may be</i>
<i>involved in the tragic events</i>

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:10.256
<i>playing out in the Northeast.</i>
<i>Now, these rumors have been fuelled</i>

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:13.159
<i>by the statements</i>
<i>of a confidential informant</i>

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:17.165
<i>who claims that the CIA</i>
<i>has facilities in the Northeast,</i>

01:02:17.233 --> 01:02:21.329
<i>where they are testing drugs with</i>
<i>some similar psychotropic properties</i>

01:02:21.404 --> 01:02:24.134
<i>as a defense against
chemical weapons.</i>

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:26.004
<i>CIA and White House officials</i>

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:29.067
<i>have declined to respond</i>
<i>to these accusations.</i>

01:02:29.178 --> 01:02:32.477
<i>Perimeters have been set up</i>
<i>all along the East Coast</i>

01:02:32.548 --> 01:02:35.517
<i>from Maryland</i>
<i>all the way to Massachusetts.</i>

01:02:46.996 --> 01:02:50.159
This house has no power going to it.

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:53.396
Nobody's driven on this driveway
for a long time, either.

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:56.097
Let me go. You guys stay right here.

01:03:26.569 --> 01:03:28.400
That's for Clement.

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:34.303
He's a retriever.

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:39.037
You lost?

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:42.650
You must be.

01:03:42.752 --> 01:03:45.744
There ain't nothing
around here for miles.

01:03:48.391 --> 01:03:50.916
Why are you eyeing my lemon drink?

01:03:55.264 --> 01:03:59.496
I suppose the kind thing for me
to do is to offer you supper.

01:04:08.911 --> 01:04:11.141
I ain't gonna ask you again.

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:31.130
I hope the meal was sufficient.

01:04:32.935 --> 01:04:35.165
I wasn't expecting guests.

01:04:40.109 --> 01:04:42.441
This is a beautiful place.

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:47.374
There's a springhouse in the back.

01:04:49.118 --> 01:04:52.713
They used to hide people
from slave chasers back there.

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:59.489
It has a speaking tube running
under the ground to the main house.

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:05.159
You can hear each other
like you were in the same room.

01:05:10.139 --> 01:05:12.198
So, what's with you two?

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:15.973
Who's chasing who?

01:05:16.712 --> 01:05:18.179
I'm sorry?

01:05:19.715 --> 01:05:24.345
Ain't no time two people staring
at each other, standing still,

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:27.753
love in both their eyes,
at the same time, equal.

01:05:29.558 --> 01:05:32.891
Truth is, someone is chasing someone.

01:05:34.363 --> 01:05:36.524
That's the way we's built.

01:05:38.267 --> 01:05:39.495
So?

01:05:40.536 --> 01:05:42.163
Who's chasing?

01:05:45.274 --> 01:05:47.504
I knew that. I knew that.

01:05:56.085 --> 01:05:58.781
Don't touch things that aren't yours.

01:06:05.394 --> 01:06:07.862
- Do you have a radio, Mrs. Jones?
- No.

01:06:07.930 --> 01:06:10.899
I got enough to fill my time right here.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:14.926
I mend my own things.
I grow my own food.

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:19.540
Although I ain't got the touch.

01:06:21.110 --> 01:06:24.546
Gardens don't grow the way they should.
Never have.

01:06:25.915 --> 01:06:30.614
- How do you stay in contact with others?
- I don't.

01:06:31.721 --> 01:06:34.554
How would you know if something
were to happen? Like a world event?

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:38.650
Mrs. Jones, something's happened
along the East Coast.

01:06:38.761 --> 01:06:40.729
Whatever it is that 
you think is so important

01:06:40.796 --> 01:06:43.230
that you need to tell me, don't.

01:06:45.401 --> 01:06:47.460
Just keep it to yourself.

01:06:48.504 --> 01:06:52.099
The world don't care about me.
I don't care about it.

01:06:56.979 --> 01:07:00.005
Suppose I have to
let you spend the night.

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:04.013
Guest room's up on the left.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.678
Mind the steps.

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:31.679
I'm scared, Elliot.

01:07:31.781 --> 01:07:33.271
It's okay.

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:40.285
I'm sorry about everything.
That Joey thing. I was being stupid.

01:07:40.356 --> 01:07:43.154
You've been great taking care of Jess.

01:07:46.028 --> 01:07:48.189
I don't like this woman.

01:07:48.297 --> 01:07:53.132
There's something <i>Exorcist-y</i> about her.
How could she hit Jess like that?

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:56.836
Well, we need to stay in this house.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:59.636
You want me to protect you,
this is how we have to do it.

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.835
Let's just deal with her.

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:21.496
I hear you whispering.

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:25.059
Planning on stealing something?

01:08:25.167 --> 01:08:26.930
No, ma'am, we're not.

01:08:27.036 --> 01:08:29.698
Plan on murdering me in my sleep?

01:08:29.772 --> 01:08:31.535
What? No!

01:10:06.035 --> 01:10:07.525
Mrs. Jones?

01:10:16.779 --> 01:10:18.269
Mrs. Jones?

01:10:35.698 --> 01:10:36.960
Crazy lady.

01:10:37.166 --> 01:10:39.031
You trying to steal my things?

01:10:39.134 --> 01:10:42.297
No! No, Mrs. Jones,
I actually wanted to talk with you.

01:10:42.371 --> 01:10:46.865
- You all are gonna leave right now!
- Ma'am, you don't understand.

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:49.706
There's something happening
in a few states, in this region.

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:52.246
- It's not safe!
- Leave now!

01:11:09.498 --> 01:11:11.864
The Lord is my shepherd.

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:17.031
The Lord is my shepherd.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.873
Mrs. Jones,
could we talk calmly for a second?

01:11:20.943 --> 01:11:24.276
Just hear me out.
See, I'm a teacher...

01:11:40.562 --> 01:11:42.223
Mrs. Jones?

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:47.868
Oh, my God.

01:11:54.777 --> 01:11:57.473
Alma, shut the windows
and the doors!

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.474
Alma?

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:10.781
Alma?

01:13:32.708 --> 01:13:34.175
Alma?

01:13:35.878 --> 01:13:37.175
Jess?

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:44.308
Hi, froggie! Hi, froggie!

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:06.867
Okay, yeah. Wait.

01:14:08.710 --> 01:14:12.874
How old do you think he is?
Is he a baby? I think he's a baby.

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:17.710
He's so tiny.
I didn't know frogs could be like that.

01:14:17.786 --> 01:14:20.118
Oh, he got water on my shoe.

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:24.222
Isn't this a cool house?

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:28.024
If we had this house,
we could make it look so pretty.

01:14:30.933 --> 01:14:34.801
Get him again. Get him again.
Hey, froggie.

01:14:34.903 --> 01:14:36.370
Alma?

01:14:37.306 --> 01:14:40.707
Good morning, Elliot.
Sounds like you're right here.

01:14:40.776 --> 01:14:43.870
- Close the windows and the doors, Alma.
- Why?

01:14:44.646 --> 01:14:48.082
Mrs. Jones just died.
Close the windows.

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:52.920
Close the door, Jess!

01:15:16.078 --> 01:15:18.239
- Is everything closed?
- Yes.

01:15:31.026 --> 01:15:35.190
- I'm sorry, Alma.
- What's going on, Elliot?

01:15:36.164 --> 01:15:37.927
It's happening here.

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:41.026
It could be the grass and
the trees are doing this now.

01:15:41.136 --> 01:15:44.037
She was alone when it happened.

01:15:44.139 --> 01:15:47.438
Seems like they might have
gotten more sensitive.

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:51.813
It's too dangerous
to go outside, isn't it?

01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.347
Yes.

01:15:56.218 --> 01:15:58.345
This is the end, isn't it?

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:02.487
I wish you were here.

01:16:03.492 --> 01:16:04.982
Me, too.

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:21.706
You remember our first date?

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:24.545
You were so quiet.

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:26.978
You bought me the mood ring.

01:16:29.851 --> 01:16:32.411
It turned purple when you wore it.

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:37.021
Then you said,
"That means you're in love."

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:41.928
It got you to talk, didn't it?

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:53.165
Then we checked
the little paper chart,

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:56.506
and it turned out that 
purple meant I was horny.

01:16:57.512 --> 01:17:00.072
- You loved that.
- I had no idea.

01:17:02.551 --> 01:17:05.987
Yours was blue.
Peaceful, right?

01:17:07.089 --> 01:17:08.579
Right.

01:17:10.292 --> 01:17:12.123
What color was love?

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:19.229
I don't remember.

01:17:19.301 --> 01:17:20.768
Me, neither.

01:17:29.277 --> 01:17:31.108
Elliot?

01:17:31.179 --> 01:17:32.305
Yeah?

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:35.179
I was just making
sure you're there.

01:17:42.991 --> 01:17:45.858
It's not right for it to end like this.

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:48.361
If we're gonna die,
I want to be with you.

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:52.331
I want to be with you,
and I'm gonna come and be with you.

01:17:56.371 --> 01:17:58.032
Elliot, don't!

01:20:25.754 --> 01:20:29.155
<i>The event must have ended</i>
<i>before we went out there.</i>

01:20:38.533 --> 01:20:40.467
I found the hair clip!

01:20:44.673 --> 01:20:48.632
You don't want to be late
for the first day schools are open.

01:20:49.477 --> 01:20:50.967
Oh, wait.

01:20:53.615 --> 01:20:56.209
I'm just gonna put this right here.

01:20:57.619 --> 01:20:59.052
Okay?

01:21:03.692 --> 01:21:07.651
- Are you okay?
- Yes, Aunt Alma. I love you.

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:11.227
I love you, too. Come here.

01:21:22.210 --> 01:21:26.306
All right. I'll pick you up
after you're done with school, okay?

01:21:37.525 --> 01:21:38.992
Bye.

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:46.499
<i>As everyone knows by now,</i>

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:49.935
<i>traces of the neurotoxin have been</i>
<i>found in some plants and trees.</i>

01:21:50.038 --> 01:21:51.403
<i>Now, most environmentalists feel</i>

01:21:51.506 --> 01:21:55.408
<i>that this event is like</i>
<i>the red tide in the ocean,</i>

01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:59.913
<i>but instead of algae killing fish,</i>
<i>this happened on land.</i>

01:22:00.015 --> 01:22:01.573
<i>Now, plants and trees</i>
<i>just can't pick up and move</i>

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:03.378
<i>when they feel threatened,</i>
<i>like other species.</i>

01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:07.615
<i>They have only one option,</i>
<i>to rapidly evolve their chemistry.</i>

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:09.212
<i>Well.</i>

01:22:09.291 --> 01:22:14.194
<i>Kay from Mississippi wants to know</i>
<i>why it started so suddenly,</i>

01:22:14.262 --> 01:22:19.529
<i>on a Tuesday at 8:33 and then ended</i>
<i>so suddenly at 9:27 the next morning.</i>

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:24.800
<i>Well, Kay, to be perfectly honest,</i>
<i>this was an act of nature,</i>

01:22:24.906 --> 01:22:27.374
<i>and we'll never fully understand it.</i>

01:22:27.442 --> 01:22:31.071
<i>And, Doctor, there's been</i>
<i>a lot of speculation</i>

01:22:31.146 --> 01:22:34.309
<i>as to why this happened</i>
<i>in the Northeast only.</i>

01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:36.076
<i>How do you explain that?</i>

01:22:36.151 --> 01:22:38.711
<i>Well, I believe, all right,</i>
<i>and this is just my opinion,</i>

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.550
<i>that this was a prelude, okay?</i>

01:22:40.622 --> 01:22:43.921
<i>A warning,
like the first spot of a rash.</i>

01:22:43.992 --> 01:22:46.153
<i>We have become
a threat to this planet.</i>

01:22:46.261 --> 01:22:48.252
<i>I don't think anybody
will argue that.</i>

01:22:48.330 --> 01:22:50.298
<i>- And this is a warning.</i>
<i>- A warning?</i>

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:54.095
<i>I think the skeptics would believe that</i>
<i>if it had occurred anywhere else.</i>

01:22:54.169 --> 01:22:56.763
<i>That's why most people</i>
<i>believe it was the government.</i>

01:22:56.838 --> 01:23:00.899
<i>If it had happened in one other place,</i>
<i>anywhere else,</i>

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:02.273
<i>we could all believe
what you're saying.</i>

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:42.704
I should drop my bicycle off at the
apartment before I go to work.

01:24:43.011 --> 01:24:45.036
Can you make Nadia's party tonight?

01:24:46.948 --> 01:24:50.213
I should drop my bicycle off at the
apartment before I go to work.

01:24:56.891 --> 01:24:58.950
That frightened me.

01:25:02.897 --> 01:25:04.728
I should drop my bicycle off

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:05.957
What?

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:18.041
My God...

01:25:18.913 --> 01:25:21.007
My
bicycle.

01:28:20.779 --> 01:28:21.780
