WEBVTT

00:03.371 --> 00:07.108
Damn, these tights are
cutting me a new butt crack.

00:07.141 --> 00:09.477
Got to say, I'm actually
uncomfortable

00:09.510 --> 00:11.479
with how comfortable
I am in these things.

00:11.512 --> 00:12.813
I mean, come on.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.216
Look, my calves look amazing.
I ought to wear these

00:15.249 --> 00:18.486
when I put the angel on top
of the tree, huh?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.654
So you and your family
looking forward to Christmas?

00:20.688 --> 00:22.356
I don't know.
I don't know

00:22.390 --> 00:24.358
what it's gonna be like
this year.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.394
My parents are divorced,
I'm divorced,

00:26.427 --> 00:28.729
my DVR recorded
Frosty the Snowman in Spanish.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.331
Just everything is...
everything's off.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.532
Right.
How about you?

00:31.565 --> 00:33.067
You going to Atlantic City?

00:33.101 --> 00:35.303
Man, it wouldn't be the holidays
if I didn't have

00:35.336 --> 00:38.139
Pai gow poker chips in one hand
and a comped eggnog in another.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.473
JANICE:
Hey, guys.

00:39.507 --> 00:42.276
Anyone else's elf pants
just crawling up their ass?

00:42.310 --> 00:43.311
Oh, right here!

00:43.344 --> 00:44.578
I can almost
taste mine.

00:44.612 --> 00:45.713
Mm.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.348
(laughter)

00:47.381 --> 00:49.450
Nathan, merry Christmas.

00:49.483 --> 00:53.154
Oh, wow. I didn't, uh, realize
we were doing gifts this year.

00:53.187 --> 00:56.090
You know what threw me off
was our bitter divorce.

00:56.124 --> 00:57.325
Come on. We're past all that.

00:57.358 --> 01:00.528
I just saw this, and it made me
think of our old tradition.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.529
The one
where we exchange pajamas,

01:01.562 --> 01:03.731
not the one where you,
uh, stuffed my stocking.

01:03.764 --> 01:06.267
See you outside,
Saint Nips.

01:06.300 --> 01:09.237
Ow! That's my spot!

01:09.270 --> 01:10.738
Uh-oh, I know what this is.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.506
What?

01:12.540 --> 01:14.475
Single girl flying solo
for the holidays

01:14.508 --> 01:16.110
buys her ex a gift.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.745
That girl is Christmas horny.

01:17.778 --> 01:19.780
(chuckles):
Shut up.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.582
He could be right, Miller.

01:21.615 --> 01:23.451
Ray is overreacting,
Booms, okay?

01:23.484 --> 01:25.586
Trust me, Janice does not want
to get back together.

01:25.619 --> 01:27.721
Oh, I didn't say she wanted
to get back together.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.323
I said she was
Christmas horny.

01:29.357 --> 01:30.391
(mouthing)

01:30.424 --> 01:31.759
And if you two guys have sex,

01:31.792 --> 01:33.661
it's gonna be drama
all over again around here.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.164
No, don't let that happen,
Miller.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.566
This was not a very pleasant
work environment

01:38.599 --> 01:39.900
after that divorce.

01:39.933 --> 01:42.170
Oh, come on. We always kept it
very professional.

01:42.203 --> 01:43.471
Really?

01:43.504 --> 01:46.340
Because I seem to remember
breaking up a spit fight

01:46.374 --> 01:47.441
in the parking lot.

01:47.475 --> 01:49.543
You both lost
your dignity.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.912
And I lost a very nice
suede jacket.

01:51.945 --> 01:56.450
Not an easy item
to find in a boy's husky.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.213
Hey. I just put

02:25.246 --> 02:26.747
Mikayla's present
under the tree.

02:26.780 --> 02:27.781
She's gonna freak.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.950
I got her
a Surface tablet.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.920
I don't know what that is,
but she's not gonna like it

02:32.953 --> 02:35.723
any more than the Walkman
cassette player I got her.

02:38.226 --> 02:42.296
I had to go to 15 stores
before I found one.

02:42.330 --> 02:46.800
Must be really popular
this year.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.669
It's-it's a computer tablet,
Mom.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.838
Yeah, you know, like the one she
was playing with at the mall.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.740
Oh, that.
I'm not a big fan

02:52.773 --> 02:55.743
of anything that has
more answers than me.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.379
Plus, she started at it
hypnotized for 90 minutes.

02:58.412 --> 03:02.250
It was like your father
with the Lane Bryant catalog.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.384
(phone ringing)

03:03.417 --> 03:05.953
Oh, Mom,
your phone's ringing.

03:05.986 --> 03:07.488
Hey, it's Grandma.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.589
Oh, great.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.624
The woman starts talking
the second she stops dialing.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.593
When I pick up,
she'll be in the middle

03:12.626 --> 03:14.328
of a conversation
I can't get out of.

03:14.362 --> 03:18.632
...so the whole thing blew up,
and now we have no heat.

03:18.666 --> 03:22.670
I told your idiot father
not to buy that fish tank.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.406
Anyway, we should
be there tomorrow.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.541
Y-You're coming here
for Christmas?

03:27.575 --> 03:29.910
How? Dad's not even able
to get around.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.746
Bud, pick up the phone!

03:34.948 --> 03:36.650
Hello?

03:36.684 --> 03:37.818
Hi, Dad.

03:37.851 --> 03:41.389
Hey, I got
two new knees-- titanium.

03:41.422 --> 03:42.990
Look at this,
look at this.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.893
She can't see ya,
ya numbskull.

03:45.926 --> 03:47.295
She's on the phone.

03:47.328 --> 03:49.330
They're like new.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.864
Yesterday, I stepped
over a puddle.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.733
That-That's great
to hear.

03:52.766 --> 03:56.036
Did I tell you, yesterday,
I stepped over a puddle?

03:56.069 --> 03:59.340
Bud, hang up the phone!

03:59.373 --> 04:02.376
Carol, since your father
can drive again,

04:02.410 --> 04:04.778
we'll be up there
to see you for Christmas.

04:04.812 --> 04:07.315
Mom, listen,
I-I'm not so sure...

04:07.348 --> 04:09.417
No, tell me tomorrow, Carol.

04:09.450 --> 04:13.321
You're running up my phone bill
and you're boring me.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.489
Bye!

04:15.523 --> 04:17.691
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no!

04:17.725 --> 04:19.893
My parents are coming
for Christmas!

04:19.927 --> 04:21.762
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

04:21.795 --> 04:23.764
We have work to do.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.799
Put on your socks
with treads.

04:25.833 --> 04:27.935
I'll dig out
the family pictures.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.437
Hey, what the hell's going on?

04:29.470 --> 04:31.505
We have to make it look like
your father

04:31.539 --> 04:32.473
and I still live here.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.342
Mother knows
I would never put up

04:34.375 --> 04:35.609
these tacky mall
kiosk ornaments.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.345
I mean, who is Little Wayne,

04:37.378 --> 04:39.647
and why is he looking
for a ho-ho-ho?

04:42.750 --> 04:45.886
Whoa-whoa-whoa, Debbie,
what day is trash pickup?

04:45.919 --> 04:46.754
Thursday.

04:46.787 --> 04:47.788
Oh, thank goodness.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.357
I'm getting my wedding ring.

04:49.390 --> 04:51.492
For three months, I've been
trying to shoot it

04:51.525 --> 04:53.461
from across the room
into the trash can.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.328
Wouldn't you know,

04:54.362 --> 04:56.664
this is the week
I finally got the shot.

04:56.697 --> 04:59.467
W-Wait-wait a second.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.802
You haven't told Grandma yet
that you two are split up?

05:01.835 --> 05:05.339
I can't. Her neighbor Judy has
been divorced for 40 years,

05:05.373 --> 05:06.974
and my mother still
silently boos her

05:07.007 --> 05:08.108
when she takes communion.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.679
Mom, I need to point out
what a hypocrite you're being.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.581
Because when I lied to you
about my divorce,

05:13.614 --> 05:15.483
you grounded me
for three months.

05:15.516 --> 05:17.551
Which ended yesterday,
by the way.

05:17.585 --> 05:20.421
So I'd appreciate it if I could
get my Xbox back.

05:20.454 --> 05:21.689
I got the ring.

05:21.722 --> 05:24.458
And who threw away
the Lane Bryant catalog?

05:24.492 --> 05:27.561
Dad, I can't believe you're
going along with this. Why?

05:27.595 --> 05:29.830
I can't have Blanche banning me
from her lake house.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.432
It's so beautiful.

05:31.465 --> 05:34.368
You wouldn't believe
how many stars you can see.

05:34.402 --> 05:38.906
Last year, I saw
Linda Ronstadt at the bait shop.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.474
Hold on just a second.
I'm confused.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.775
If they still think
you're married,

05:41.809 --> 05:43.511
why would you still live
at this house?

05:43.544 --> 05:44.645
Yeah, they know
that you moved

05:44.678 --> 05:45.746
to Myrtle Beach
ten years ago.

05:45.779 --> 05:47.047
We all visited
at the same time.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.716
I was on
Grandma's sunscreen duty.

05:48.749 --> 05:53.387
Felt like I was massaging
damp corduroy.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.655
About a month ago,
my mother sent

05:54.688 --> 05:57.591
candied pecans down to Myrtle
Beach, and they got returned.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.560
When she called, I panicked.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.029
I told her we moved back
to Virginia to help Debbie

06:02.062 --> 06:04.097
while Adam was in rehab.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.599
Rehab?

06:05.633 --> 06:07.501
Adam doesn't even eat
sugar, let alone drink.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.169
It was for heroin.

06:09.202 --> 06:10.871
Oh, come on!

06:10.904 --> 06:13.040
It's a tangled web, honey,
and we're all in it.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.475
Nathan, you're gonna have
to call Janice

06:14.508 --> 06:15.609
and get her over here tomorrow.

06:15.643 --> 06:16.877
What?

06:16.910 --> 06:18.479
I didn't tell her
about your divorce either.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.913
Mother would kill me
if she knew

06:19.947 --> 06:21.715
I let my son give up
on his marriage.

06:21.749 --> 06:24.485
Mom, I'm not gonna
spend my Christmas lying.

06:24.518 --> 06:25.953
Hey.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.556
Uh-oh. Carol, what are
we gonna do about the kids?

06:28.589 --> 06:31.592
She's not gonna be able
to keep up with the lies. Carol?

06:31.625 --> 06:33.561
Merry Christmas, honey.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.196
Your uncle gave you
a computer tableau.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.499
Cool!

06:38.532 --> 06:40.167
CAROL: I don't even
need to say any more.

06:40.200 --> 06:41.168
She's already
in a trance.

06:41.201 --> 06:44.705
But she'll come up for air
around New Year's.

06:44.738 --> 06:45.906
Mom, I'm not doing this.

06:45.939 --> 06:47.841
You're not gonna ruin
my family's Christmas

06:47.875 --> 06:49.577
by forcing us all to tell lies.

06:49.610 --> 06:50.578
Wait, what lies?

06:50.611 --> 06:52.713
She told my grandma
you were addicted to heroin.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.615
That's not very Christmasy.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.651
Well, don't worry about it,
because we're not playing along.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.019
Yeah, me, neither.

06:59.052 --> 07:01.889
You made your bed, Mom,
now you can lie in it.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.157
Oh, really? Really?

07:04.191 --> 07:06.927
Mom's in a jam,
but she's made her bed?

07:06.960 --> 07:08.529
What about all the beds

07:08.562 --> 07:09.997
you people have made
over the years?

07:10.030 --> 07:12.165
That summer when you
gave yourself the home perm.

07:12.199 --> 07:14.502
Did I say, "Nathan,
you made your bed,"

07:14.535 --> 07:17.538
or did I send you
to clown school for three weeks

07:17.571 --> 07:19.106
until it settled into a wave?

07:20.641 --> 07:22.676
And, Debbie,
when you wet your pants

07:22.710 --> 07:25.212
at your school talent show,
who pulled the fire alarm

07:25.245 --> 07:27.114
so your sorority sisters
wouldn't find out?

07:28.716 --> 07:30.618
Year after year, I've cleaned up
after your messes.

07:30.651 --> 07:31.752
And when Christmas rolls around,

07:31.785 --> 07:33.253
do I put you
on the naughty list?

07:33.286 --> 07:35.989
No, I make sure that
your Christmases are magical.

07:36.023 --> 07:39.560
And now, this one year,
when Mom's in a jam

07:39.593 --> 07:42.630
and needs your help,
you have the nerve to tell her

07:42.663 --> 07:45.966
she's made her bed
and there'll be no Christmas?!

07:47.668 --> 07:49.637
Merry Christmas!

07:49.670 --> 07:52.573
ALL:
Merry Christmas!

07:58.145 --> 08:01.048
And so that son of a gun
had the nerve

08:01.081 --> 08:03.917
to ride our tail for 15 miles.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.686
So, finally, at a red light,

08:05.719 --> 08:09.657
I get out of the car and I say,
"Listen, Officer,

08:09.690 --> 08:12.059
turn off those
damn flashing lights."

08:13.694 --> 08:15.729
And I bet Dad
wasn't even speeding.

08:15.763 --> 08:17.164
No.

08:17.197 --> 08:20.568
But it seems that we were
dragging a bicycle

08:20.601 --> 08:22.035
for a few miles.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.672
Watch this.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.575
See that puddle?
Yeah.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.242
Presto, right over it.
(chuckles)

08:31.645 --> 08:32.646
Look at you, Grandpa,

08:32.680 --> 08:36.149
you're like the Evel Knievel
of kitchen spills.

08:36.183 --> 08:38.251
So, Nathan,
you and Janice

08:38.285 --> 08:40.053
are coming up
on an anniversary.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.656
Yeah, yeah,
four, uh, four years.

08:42.690 --> 08:44.625
What are you supposed
to get at four?

08:44.658 --> 08:46.927
Is it, uh, chairs
or personal space or...

08:46.960 --> 08:48.662
Oh, no, four is...
four is linen.

08:48.696 --> 08:49.797
And we're gonna
have to get

08:49.830 --> 08:52.733
new sheets for our bed
'cause the ones we have are all

08:52.766 --> 08:54.334
worn out, huh?
(laughs):
Oh!

08:54.367 --> 08:56.236
I wish your diaphragm
would wear out.

08:58.639 --> 09:01.775
You know, when you wait so long
to make babies,

09:01.809 --> 09:04.712
it's more likely
that they'll be cross-eyed

09:04.745 --> 09:06.246
or foggy-headed.

09:06.279 --> 09:08.916
So, Adam,
how's rehab?

09:10.283 --> 09:12.285
Did you see Lindsay Lohan
in there?

09:12.319 --> 09:15.155
I like her. She's got spunk.

09:15.188 --> 09:16.690
No, no celebrities.

09:16.724 --> 09:19.359
It's just me and my other
heroin addict friends.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.996
Mm. I know what it's like
to be addicted.

09:23.030 --> 09:28.235
My friend Alice got me hooked
on her grandson's ADD meds.

09:28.268 --> 09:32.239
I made a quilt
as long as my driveway.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.776
Uh, tell me something.

09:35.809 --> 09:37.277
Why'd I come in here again?

09:37.310 --> 09:38.912
Yeah, you smelled muffins,
Grandpa.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.147
Do you know what?

09:40.180 --> 09:41.782
Why don't you take some out
to everybody?

09:41.815 --> 09:43.316
Oh, fabulous.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.919
Smell good.
What are they, muffins?

09:48.822 --> 09:50.724
Who wants
to see my new knees?

09:50.758 --> 09:52.993
We've moved on
from the knees, Bud.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.095
If you want
to show them off some more,

09:55.128 --> 09:57.731
go dance around in traffic.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.934
Ah, the familiar banter
of a long-lasting marriage.

10:00.968 --> 10:05.272
Marriage is a beautiful thing,
but it's damn hard.

10:05.305 --> 10:08.709
I said go dance
in traffic, Bud.

10:11.745 --> 10:15.649
It takes strength to stay
married, but you have to.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.317
God doesn't want us

10:17.350 --> 10:20.353
to be 82 years old and alone.

10:20.387 --> 10:22.823
And we don't want
to either, right?

10:22.856 --> 10:25.826
Right, Mother.
W-We don't want that.

10:25.859 --> 10:27.795
None of us want that.

10:27.828 --> 10:29.863
Oh, Janice,
Grandma wants a baby,

10:29.897 --> 10:31.832
but she doesn't want
to see us make it

10:31.865 --> 10:33.166
right in front of her.

10:33.200 --> 10:36.870
Mmm! Smells like someone's
making some muffins.

10:36.904 --> 10:38.806
I'm gonna go in the kitchen
and get me one.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.407
Here, hold this.

10:43.977 --> 10:45.078
Come on, Ray.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.414
Pick up, pick up, pick up, man.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.816
Ni hao, Nate!

10:48.849 --> 10:51.752
I'm up $38,000!

10:51.785 --> 10:53.754
Whoop, I'm even.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.023
Look, Ray, I am
in big trouble here, man.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.825
Janice is here,
in the house.

10:57.858 --> 10:58.992
My mom invited her.

10:59.026 --> 11:01.862
Janice is spending
Christmas with you?

11:01.895 --> 11:02.930
I'm gone 12 hours!

11:02.963 --> 11:04.197
How did this happen?

11:04.231 --> 11:08.068
Look, long insane story short,
my mom is making Janice and me

11:08.101 --> 11:10.904
pretend that we're still married
in front of my grandparents.

11:10.938 --> 11:12.205
And she looks good, man.

11:12.239 --> 11:14.274
The only way to stop myself
from getting aroused

11:14.307 --> 11:17.778
is to look at my grandma,
and that's weird.

11:17.811 --> 11:19.479
I'm scared, Ray.

11:19.512 --> 11:21.849
(whispers): I'm scared
that I'm Christmas horny.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.917
Damn it, Nate!

11:23.951 --> 11:25.953
(speaking Chinese):

11:35.829 --> 11:37.230
I know, I know,
I know.

11:37.264 --> 11:38.799
Look,
I need help, man.

11:38.832 --> 11:39.800
I am losing control!

11:39.833 --> 11:41.268
I mean, my mind
is going places.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.070
I mean, maybe I'm more
than Christmas horny.

11:43.103 --> 11:44.337
Maybe this is a sign

11:44.371 --> 11:46.339
that Janice and I
need to get back together.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.876
So? There's a sign
right in front of me

11:48.909 --> 11:50.811
that says, "No talking
on cell phones."

11:50.844 --> 11:53.080
Signs don't mean
a damn thing, Nate!

11:53.113 --> 11:55.883
JANICE: Nate, honey, you
need help down there?

11:55.916 --> 11:56.917
Is that Janice?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.418
Did she just call you "honey"?

11:58.451 --> 12:02.155
Well, you have definitely
got my vote, Congressman.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.924
(laughs)

12:03.957 --> 12:05.092
Stay strong, Nate!

12:06.426 --> 12:08.796
Oh, my God, don't leave me alone
up there like that.

12:08.829 --> 12:10.530
Your grandfather keeps
asking me to lay down

12:10.563 --> 12:12.132
so he can step over me.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.969
Listen, uh, thanks
again for doing this.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.271
Yeah, truth is, I didn't
really have much else going on.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.908
I was probably just gonna
drink a pint of vodka,

12:20.941 --> 12:22.976
then unwrap the gift
I wrapped for myself,

12:23.010 --> 12:25.012
which was just
more vodka.

12:27.014 --> 12:27.815
So...

12:27.848 --> 12:29.983
Not a great time of year
to be single.

12:30.017 --> 12:32.385
No, no, it's not.
It's not.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.987
Oh, by the way,
while we're on that subject,

12:34.021 --> 12:35.956
I just want to be clear
that I'm not sending you

12:35.989 --> 12:37.958
any mixed signals about
why I asked you to do this.

12:37.991 --> 12:38.892
What do you mean?

12:38.926 --> 12:39.827
Well, I just think

12:39.860 --> 12:43.030
it would be dangerous
for us to, you know...

12:43.063 --> 12:44.397
deck each other's halls.

12:47.167 --> 12:48.936
Jingle each other's
bells, you know?

12:50.403 --> 12:52.239
Uh, trim each
other's trees...
I got it,
I got it.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.907
I got it after
the first one.
You got it.

12:53.941 --> 12:55.042
Yeah, you got it.

12:55.075 --> 12:55.909
Oh, Nathan, grow up.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.577
I do not want
to have sex with you.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.212
Is that why you were
so jumpy upstairs?

12:59.246 --> 13:01.248
Oh, come on, Janice,
you were all over me.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.516
Oh, my God,
you're so full of yourself.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.053
You asked me to come over and
pretend to be married to you.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.921
I mean, what am I
supposed to do?

13:07.955 --> 13:09.156
Well, what about
at work the other day?

13:09.189 --> 13:10.390
You squeezed
my nipple,

13:10.423 --> 13:12.392
and you know about
my sweet spot.
(laughs)

13:12.425 --> 13:13.593
Okay, fine.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.063
I... I did purposely
tweak your sweet spot.

13:16.096 --> 13:18.598
And maybe I thought
about having sex with you

13:18.631 --> 13:20.300
for, like, half a second.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.369
But, you know, it's Christmas.

13:22.402 --> 13:23.570
I was lonely.

13:23.603 --> 13:25.105
Yeah, it crossed
my mind, too.

13:25.138 --> 13:25.906
What is it with us?

13:25.939 --> 13:27.340
We either want
to kill each other

13:27.374 --> 13:28.441
or have sex with each other.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.276
There's got to be
an in-between.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.111
Yeah, I think
it's called friendship.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.512
Friendship.

13:32.545 --> 13:34.614
What would we do,
text each other all the time

13:34.647 --> 13:36.416
and secretly wish
the other one gains weight?

13:36.449 --> 13:37.885
That's what me
and Ray do.

13:37.918 --> 13:38.986
(laughs)

13:39.019 --> 13:41.288
Hey, you know what our first
friend activity could be?

13:41.321 --> 13:43.456
It's something we really enjoyed
when we were married.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.126
I doubt the Clinique counter's
open on Christmas.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.560
No, I meant...

13:47.594 --> 13:49.396
pretend we're a happily
married couple.

13:49.429 --> 13:50.530
Ah.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.933
All right,
looks like improv camp

13:52.966 --> 13:54.167
is finally gonna pay off.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.202
Oh.

13:59.139 --> 14:03.410
Bud, enough of the red
jellybeans on the windowsill.

14:03.443 --> 14:07.314
It's a gingerbread house,
not a ginger whorehouse.

14:07.347 --> 14:08.348
(phone ringing)

14:10.383 --> 14:11.919
Hello?

14:11.952 --> 14:13.186
RAY:
Carol, we got a problem!

14:13.220 --> 14:14.321
What? Why are you...

14:14.354 --> 14:15.555
It's Ray!
Get to somewhere private!

14:15.588 --> 14:16.924
Okay, okay, okay, I'm going.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.125
It's an emergency!
Give me a sec.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.528
What's going on?
Why are you yelling?

14:21.561 --> 14:24.031
I'm yelling because
it's an emergency!

14:24.064 --> 14:26.099
Nate is
Christmas horny,

14:26.133 --> 14:28.235
and he's getting
feelings for Janice!

14:28.268 --> 14:29.402
No, he's not.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.571
He's been squirming
away from her all day.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.073
Why are you
saying this?

14:33.106 --> 14:34.041
He called me
ten minutes ago

14:34.074 --> 14:35.408
and told me that
he was worried

14:35.442 --> 14:37.044
he couldn't keep
his hands off her.

14:37.077 --> 14:38.178
It doesn't look
like that to me.

14:38.211 --> 14:39.279
Well, go look again.

14:44.317 --> 14:45.919
Wow, you're right.
(giggles)

14:45.953 --> 14:47.354
These chairs
are slippery.

14:48.688 --> 14:49.990
Oh, my God!

14:50.023 --> 14:51.324
Those chairs aren't
slippery at all!

14:51.358 --> 14:52.592
You're right, Ray.

14:52.625 --> 14:54.928
All morning, he was
running away from her.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.263
Now he's cuddling up.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.264
He's fallen for her.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.131
And not just for a hookup.

14:58.165 --> 14:59.699
He told me that
he was thinking about

14:59.732 --> 15:00.700
getting back together with her.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.103
Oh, my God, what have I done?

15:03.136 --> 15:04.371
What indeed, Carol?

15:04.404 --> 15:05.605
What indeed?!

15:05.638 --> 15:07.574
Hey, Lao Zing!

15:07.607 --> 15:10.978
Can a brother get
another eggnog over here?

15:11.011 --> 15:14.047
Everybody get eggnog but me?

15:14.081 --> 15:15.515
So, listen,

15:15.548 --> 15:18.952
last week when I was
giving myself an examination,

15:18.986 --> 15:20.287
I found a lump.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.190
But it turns out
it was a butterscotch

15:23.223 --> 15:26.093
I had spit out in
the middle of the night.

15:26.126 --> 15:29.262
But it made me realize
that I had to start thinking

15:29.296 --> 15:31.231
about who is inheriting what.

15:31.264 --> 15:34.234
Lake house, lake house,
lake house.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.304
Nathan, I'm thinking
that Janice

15:37.337 --> 15:39.572
should have
my mother's ruby ring.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.975
Hey, I have fingers.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.577
And so does Adam, sweetheart.

15:44.611 --> 15:48.481
And his could be sticky fingers
if his smack habit comes back.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.551
No offense!

15:51.584 --> 15:54.988
Hey... I'm a junkie.

15:55.022 --> 15:58.125
Nathan, make sure this fits her.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.526
Oh.
Ooh.

15:59.559 --> 16:02.129
Put it on right,
Nate.

16:02.162 --> 16:05.132
I'll talk to Nathan about it
as soon as my mother leaves.

16:05.165 --> 16:06.266
No time, Carol!

16:06.299 --> 16:09.369
Cuddling leads to hooking up,
which leads to dating.

16:09.402 --> 16:10.570
Next thing you know,
they're remarried,

16:10.603 --> 16:11.771
using pet names again.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.406
And I will not suffer
through another meal

16:13.440 --> 16:14.741
with Popcorn and Monkey!

16:18.811 --> 16:20.247
Janice Miller,

16:20.280 --> 16:23.383
make me the happiest man
on earth and be my...

16:23.416 --> 16:25.985
No...!

16:29.089 --> 16:30.357
I got it.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.624
What on earth?

16:31.658 --> 16:34.427
Mom, what...
(sighs)

16:34.461 --> 16:36.263
Nathan, you're happily divorced.

16:36.296 --> 16:38.565
Don't ask her
to marry you again.

16:38.598 --> 16:39.599
Mom, I was just...

16:39.632 --> 16:41.401
I know, Christmas horny!

16:43.336 --> 16:45.305
It's my fault for
asking you to lie

16:45.338 --> 16:46.606
about both of our divorces.

16:46.639 --> 16:48.708
Both of your divorces?

16:48.741 --> 16:51.378
Mom, we were
just acting.

16:51.411 --> 16:53.646
Janice and I aren't
getting remarried.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.449
Oh.

16:56.483 --> 16:57.650
Okay.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.386
Me, too.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.254
Just acting.
(laughs)

17:01.288 --> 17:03.423
Who's ready
to go caroling?

17:03.456 --> 17:04.624
You're divorced?

17:04.657 --> 17:06.393
You've been lying to me?

17:08.161 --> 17:10.463
Yes, Mother, I am.

17:10.497 --> 17:13.166
I'm divorced.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.102
And I know you
have your beliefs, and...

17:15.135 --> 17:17.070
and I'm sorry
to let you down,

17:17.104 --> 17:19.206
but it was
the right thing for me.

17:19.239 --> 17:21.674
Because while
I-I agree with you

17:21.708 --> 17:24.777
it takes strength
to stay in a good marriage,

17:24.811 --> 17:28.148
it also takes strength
to get out of a bad one.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.651
I learned that from my son.

17:31.684 --> 17:33.686
And I'm proud of both of us.

17:35.288 --> 17:36.689
And for the record,
our marriage is great.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.758
Yeah, and I have never
used drugs in my life.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.727
And your business isn't failing?

17:40.760 --> 17:41.728
(exhales)

17:41.761 --> 17:43.096
Our marriage is great.

17:45.465 --> 17:46.533
Can't believe this.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.201
Where are my car keys?

17:48.235 --> 17:49.836
Well, we're not
leaving yet, Bud.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.572
These people are gonna get
a piece of my mind.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.742
Oh, you're not coming with me.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.412
Excuse me?

17:59.446 --> 18:02.282
62 years of marriage, Blanche!

18:02.315 --> 18:05.685
62 years of
blah-blah-blabitty-blah.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.654
Well, I've had enough, Blanche.
Enough!

18:07.687 --> 18:10.390
Deja vu.

18:10.423 --> 18:11.891
You can't do this, Dad.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.826
You've been married
for 62 years!

18:13.860 --> 18:17.497
Make that 61 years,
11 months and 26 days.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.467
Since we haven't had sex
since Tuesday.

18:21.901 --> 18:24.237
Well, that's not true.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.839
I did some stuff to you
with my hand

18:26.873 --> 18:28.508
on the drive here.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.610
Oh, my God.

18:34.181 --> 18:38.651
I spilled soup in my lap,
you wiped it off with a napkin!

18:38.685 --> 18:42.255
Vigorously, for 16 miles.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.557
That counts!

18:44.591 --> 18:46.726
I think
I'm gonna pass out.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.529
I'm sorry, Blanche.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.698
These new knees were
made for walking.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.402
Hey, you know what
else we were good at?

18:55.435 --> 18:56.903
Drinking through
awkward situations.

18:56.936 --> 18:58.705
Yeah, I'll race you
to the kitchen.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.607
Blanche,

19:00.640 --> 19:03.410
I know it's been
a bad day for all of us,

19:03.443 --> 19:05.478
but we have a lot of
good ones ahead.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.714
Uh, fortunately,
there's a lake house,

19:07.747 --> 19:09.182
which we both
have access to.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.550
Oh, you're never getting

19:10.583 --> 19:12.785
to that lake house.
Damn it!

19:12.819 --> 19:15.588
This was the worst
Christmas ever.

19:15.622 --> 19:18.591
Well, I hope you're happy.

19:18.625 --> 19:19.659
You know what,
Mom?

19:19.692 --> 19:21.494
I am.

19:21.528 --> 19:23.296
I am happy.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.565
And maybe when all of
the gingerbread dust settles,

19:25.598 --> 19:28.301
you'll realize that
you're happier, too.

19:28.335 --> 19:31.938
I dedicated my whole life
to taking care of that dope.

19:31.971 --> 19:35.442
He couldn't always jump
over puddles, you know.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.510
I mean, all that effort,
for what?

19:37.544 --> 19:40.680
To be abandoned
on my last Christmas?

19:40.713 --> 19:43.216
Oh, cut
the "last Christmas" crap.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.617
You're gonna outlast us all.

19:44.651 --> 19:47.620
Great, I'll live forever,
but I'll be alone.

19:50.857 --> 19:52.959
Hi.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.627
(clears throat)
Quick question here.

19:54.661 --> 19:56.463
While ago, I went
out to the car.

19:56.496 --> 19:57.497
I got out there,

19:57.530 --> 19:59.666
I couldn't remember
what I went out there for.

19:59.699 --> 20:02.302
Does... anyone know?

20:02.335 --> 20:05.338
Dad, you went
out there because...

20:08.641 --> 20:11.811
You went out there
to look for your scarf.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.614
Well, that
makes sense.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.716
Guess I found it.

20:16.749 --> 20:19.752
All right, when we gonna serve
this Thanksgiving turkey?

20:24.591 --> 20:27.427
Thank you.

20:27.460 --> 20:29.796
He's not much,
but he's mine.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.532
(choked up):
Merry Christmas.

20:42.008 --> 20:44.611
*

20:44.644 --> 20:46.379
Hey, thanks,
Grandpa.

20:46.413 --> 20:49.382
A couple of bars of used soap?

20:49.416 --> 20:51.484
No, I... I regifted.

20:51.518 --> 20:52.752
Those are my old knees.

20:55.655 --> 20:57.056
Okay, guys.
Everybody get together.

20:57.089 --> 20:59.592
Mikayla's gonna
take our picture.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.363
Aren't we all having fun?

21:03.396 --> 21:04.697
This is the best
Easter ever.
