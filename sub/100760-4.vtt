WEBVTT

00:10.678 --> 00:12.930
Ah, go for it. It's on me.

00:12.972 --> 00:14.598
Dave, it's costing you, like,

00:14.640 --> 00:16.642
20 grand to teach me
how to golf.

00:16.684 --> 00:18.686
I'm worth $50.3 billion.

00:18.728 --> 00:22.773
I've spent more on a, on
an endangered parrot sandwich.

00:22.815 --> 00:24.984
Go on.

00:27.403 --> 00:29.530
So remember, head down.

00:29.572 --> 00:31.407
Head down, okay.

00:32.825 --> 00:34.827
Ooh.

00:34.869 --> 00:37.413
That felt nice.

00:37.455 --> 00:40.374
A majestic arc to that one.
A pleasure to behold.

00:40.416 --> 00:42.418
Ah, beginner's luck.

00:42.460 --> 00:44.086
Don't you ever
get bored of this?

00:44.128 --> 00:46.464
Me, bored? No.

00:46.505 --> 00:50.551
You got to understand, Nate,
I lived a life of purpose,

00:50.593 --> 00:52.386
so now this is my reward.

00:52.428 --> 00:54.722
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.559
So get me an Arnold Palmer.

00:58.601 --> 01:01.312
Certainly, sir.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.606
- Arnold.
- Hello, Choak.

01:03.647 --> 01:06.650
Watch this, you piece of shit.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.659
♪ ♪

01:19.330 --> 01:20.581
And then, out of nowhere,

01:20.623 --> 01:22.291
he just tackles
the Arnold Palmer bot.

01:22.333 --> 01:25.085
Supposedly, the real Arnold
cockblocked him for years

01:25.127 --> 01:28.005
when they lived together
on a nudist commune in 1973.

01:28.047 --> 01:30.382
I know.
I-Ivan, your night angel,

01:30.424 --> 01:33.636
showed me some
spicy memory files of Choak,

01:33.677 --> 01:35.721
which I'm pretty sure
he stole and sold.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.181
Oh, God.

01:37.223 --> 01:39.141
Choak lived this full life,
you know?

01:39.183 --> 01:42.561
It made me think it might be
nice to be old and smug one day,

01:42.603 --> 01:44.480
but I don't have anything
to be smug about.

01:44.522 --> 01:46.065
Just wish I could keep working.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.067
Uh, you're not allowed.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.610
Yeah, life's tough enough

01:49.652 --> 01:51.546
without uploads driving down
wages for us meat folks.

01:51.570 --> 01:52.780
I know,

01:52.822 --> 01:54.573
but they called me a barista
at my funeral.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.575
Yeah?

01:56.617 --> 01:58.744
Well, that's not me, okay?

01:58.786 --> 02:01.455
I-I can contribute
more than that.

02:01.497 --> 02:02.832
I'll see you.

02:02.873 --> 02:05.459
Hey, I want to show you
something.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.131
2Gigs please.

02:11.173 --> 02:13.175
Oh, God.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.232
What is this place?

02:28.274 --> 02:31.318
Lakeview's lowest class
of upload.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.072
- This is where the 2Gigs live.
- 2Gigs?

02:35.114 --> 02:37.408
Yeah, they only get
two gigs of data a month,

02:37.449 --> 02:38.617
and once they run out,

02:38.659 --> 02:40.160
they can't afford anything.

02:49.587 --> 02:51.064
Things included
in your level of service...

02:51.088 --> 02:53.924
Your shower,
your view of the lake...

02:53.966 --> 02:55.718
They don't have.

02:55.759 --> 02:58.846
Lean Cuisine
sponsors the cafeteria

02:58.888 --> 03:00.472
to try new recipes.

03:00.514 --> 03:04.852
"Today's Special:
Fiesta Jalapeño Creamed Meat."

03:04.894 --> 03:06.437
Yikes.

03:06.478 --> 03:09.231
What is this?
It's only the first five pages.

03:09.273 --> 03:11.775
Yup, the free sample.

03:11.817 --> 03:15.195
If they want to read the whole
book, they have to pay extra.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.449
Oh, hey, love Harry Potter.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.909
All the magic's so cool.

03:19.950 --> 03:23.078
There's magic in Harry Potter?

03:25.080 --> 03:27.333
He's frozen until next month,

03:27.374 --> 03:29.919
unless someone
adds to his account,

03:29.960 --> 03:32.046
but most of them don't have
money of their own.

03:32.087 --> 03:33.881
They don't even get
the basic sweat suit

03:33.923 --> 03:36.884
included in the plan.

03:36.926 --> 03:37.968
Whoa.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.512
Wait.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.514
He doesn't have a penis.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.100
Yeah, it must be
the end of his month.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.894
Oh, man,

03:46.936 --> 03:49.855
he's making clothes
out of Lean Cuisine boxes.

03:49.897 --> 03:51.148
No, that's not...

03:53.192 --> 03:54.693
- Oh.
- Okay.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.921
That's actually
kind of impressive,

03:55.945 --> 03:57.613
but Horizen should just give

03:57.655 --> 04:01.450
anybody a penis, or clothing,
or-or an entire book.

04:01.492 --> 04:02.910
I mean, it's just code.

04:02.952 --> 04:05.162
Well, they want people
to pay for upgrades.

04:05.204 --> 04:06.747
It's called capitalism.

04:09.583 --> 04:12.378
Look at this.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.171
This is terrible.

04:14.213 --> 04:16.423
- These people
don't deserve this.

04:16.465 --> 04:18.550
- I know.
- Nobody deserves this.

04:18.592 --> 04:20.970
Somebody should do something.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.013
Wait, where's that music
coming from?

04:23.055 --> 04:25.808
Oh, uh, I don't know.

04:25.849 --> 04:27.226
That's...

04:27.267 --> 04:28.644
weird.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.521
Anyway, Nathan, you were saying?

04:30.562 --> 04:33.190
Maybe my purpose
is to help the 2Gigs.

04:35.109 --> 04:36.544
I could give them
some of my breakfast.

04:36.568 --> 04:37.695
It's unlimited.

04:37.736 --> 04:39.255
You know, I'll just need
some bigger pockets.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.657
- I could...
- Babe, where are you?

04:41.699 --> 04:43.510
The Vogue interviewer
is gonna be here any minute.

04:43.534 --> 04:44.994
Is this dress okay?

04:45.035 --> 04:46.620
I wanted to show off
my shoulder blades.

04:46.662 --> 04:48.080
I just got them sharpened.

04:48.122 --> 04:51.333
Oh, my God, did he go too sharp?

04:51.375 --> 04:52.935
He said they were gonna
soften up a bit,

04:52.960 --> 04:54.104
but I think they're too sharp.

04:54.128 --> 04:56.171
Shit. Just hurry up, okay?

04:56.213 --> 04:58.257
I completely forgot.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.926
Ingrid and I have this interview
about modern love.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.012
I will be back.
I'll see you soon.

05:03.053 --> 05:05.889
Yeah, no. No worries.
I totally get it. Have-have fun.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.683
He should be here any minute.

05:07.725 --> 05:09.935
Well, not here here,
but you know.

05:09.977 --> 05:12.938
So, for the article, I wanted
to refer to relationships

05:12.980 --> 05:15.607
between bios and uploads as

05:15.649 --> 05:18.110
"the ultimate
long-distance relationship."

05:18.152 --> 05:20.988
Oh, my God, totally.
That's exactly what it's like.

05:21.030 --> 05:22.489
Oh, here he is.

05:25.743 --> 05:28.787
That was, that was just a fart.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.664
Sorry.

05:30.706 --> 05:33.751
- Hi, baby.
- Hey, hey.

05:33.792 --> 05:35.878
I'm so sorry I'm late.

05:35.919 --> 05:37.963
Hi, Nathan.
So Ingrid and I were just

05:38.005 --> 05:40.424
talking about what it's like
to go from being

05:40.466 --> 05:43.093
a regular old bio couple
to one that lives

05:43.135 --> 05:44.803
on two different
planes of existence.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.364
Oh, well, I'm not sure
we ever really lived

05:46.388 --> 05:48.932
on the same plane of existence.

05:48.974 --> 05:50.517
It was a joke.

05:50.559 --> 05:51.894
Oh, no, that's funny.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.730
No... Don't put that in.
Thank you.

05:54.772 --> 05:56.565
I mean, you should've seen him.

05:56.607 --> 05:59.193
He was moved by the 2Gigs.

05:59.234 --> 06:01.195
I mean, it was so cute.

06:01.236 --> 06:04.698
Ugh, that place
is too depressing for me.

06:04.740 --> 06:08.786
But that's nice, your little
play boyfriend wants to help.

06:08.827 --> 06:12.122
- What'd he do?
- He had to leave.

06:12.164 --> 06:13.957
Uh, his girlfriend called.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.751
Uh, they had something planned,
I guess.

06:15.793 --> 06:19.963
That is right. Your boyfriend
already has a girlfriend.

06:20.005 --> 06:23.842
So I guess it's her job to worry
about his life's purpose,

06:23.884 --> 06:26.720
and it's your job to worry
about keeping the heat on

06:26.762 --> 06:29.348
- in your apartment.
- I know.

06:29.389 --> 06:32.101
Stop worrying about this guy
and keep your mind on your work.

06:34.478 --> 06:38.023
And clean up
that old dude's unibrow.

06:39.566 --> 06:44.238
Clean it up or fill it in?

06:44.279 --> 06:46.281
Wait. No.

06:46.323 --> 06:47.908
Slide it down.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.746
Ooh...

06:52.788 --> 06:54.331
So, Nathan,
since you were uploaded,

06:54.373 --> 06:56.125
how has
your relationship changed?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.335
Well, honestly,
it just got me thinking a lot

06:58.377 --> 07:00.379
about life and what's
really important to me.

07:00.420 --> 07:04.174
Yeah? But our relationship
hasn't changed at all.

07:04.216 --> 07:06.760
We still talk every day.
Even twice a day, sometimes.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.762
Yeah. I mean, we still talk,
but it's definitely

07:08.804 --> 07:10.013
changed the relationship.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.640
I mean,
now she literally owns me.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.809
Really?

07:13.851 --> 07:15.644
Uh, that... that's not
what it sounds like.

07:15.686 --> 07:17.855
Nathan didn't have
an upload plan

07:17.896 --> 07:21.525
at the time of his accident,
so it was the only option.

07:21.567 --> 07:24.361
And now it's just easier
for all of our stuff

07:24.403 --> 07:26.113
to be in the same place,
you know?

07:26.155 --> 07:29.074
Like, uh, couples that share
an e-mail account,

07:29.116 --> 07:30.284
the ultimate trust.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.327
Aw, that's adorbs.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.621
Let's talk about
something more fun.

07:34.663 --> 07:36.707
How's the sex?

07:36.748 --> 07:38.333
Ah, well, we haven't tried it.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.294
Yet. We haven't tried it yet.

07:40.335 --> 07:42.796
We were just waiting
for him to get adjusted.

07:42.838 --> 07:44.274
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were waiting for me?

07:44.298 --> 07:45.650
'Cause I thought you said
the suit was so gross.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.050
Well, that suit looked gross

07:47.092 --> 07:48.969
because a newer model's
coming out, so...

07:49.011 --> 07:52.681
we were just, we were
waiting for the new suit.

07:56.185 --> 07:59.479
Speaking of sex, would you like
to watch one of our sex tapes?

07:59.521 --> 08:02.482
My dad got Ang Lee
to edit the body cam footage

08:02.524 --> 08:03.901
from our first night together.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.569
I would absolutely love that.

08:05.611 --> 08:08.280
Okay.
They're on my office computer.

08:18.290 --> 08:20.375
All right, good talk.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.940
- Angel?
- Hey.

08:45.609 --> 08:48.237
- Hey.
- You okay?

08:50.656 --> 08:52.241
No.

08:52.282 --> 08:54.034
I was gonna lie,
but you probably have

08:54.076 --> 08:58.038
some kind of, like, truth
detector button or something.

08:58.080 --> 08:59.790
Well, I don't.

08:59.831 --> 09:00.999
Yeah, of course not.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.501
That's crazy. I knew that.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.503
Mm, no, you didn't.

09:04.544 --> 09:07.422
- My button says you're lying.
- Stop it. Is there a button?

09:07.464 --> 09:11.009
Yeah, no. That would
be, like, really intrusive.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.929
Maybe my boss has one, though.

09:13.971 --> 09:17.432
I don't know.
She can be a real nightmare.

09:18.684 --> 09:21.520
In your experience,
do relationships

09:21.561 --> 09:26.525
between uploads and, uh,
real people ever work?

09:26.566 --> 09:28.819
You're a real person.

09:28.860 --> 09:30.779
Yeah, uh, living people.

09:30.821 --> 09:33.782
Sure. Sometimes.

09:33.824 --> 09:38.412
I mean, they're hard, but maybe
that makes them more worthwhile?

09:38.453 --> 09:40.831
I always root for them.

09:40.872 --> 09:43.000
Sounds corny, I know.

09:43.041 --> 09:44.876
No, it's not.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.920
It's nice.

09:50.048 --> 09:51.508
Ingrid and I, we always had

09:51.550 --> 09:53.635
that physical thing
we could fall back on.

09:53.677 --> 09:58.390
You know? But without it,
it just kind of feels like

09:58.432 --> 10:01.268
we're brother and sister?

10:01.310 --> 10:04.354
If I didn't really like
my sister.

10:04.396 --> 10:06.273
Well,
you know you can still have

10:06.315 --> 10:08.859
a physical relationship
as an upload, right?

10:08.900 --> 10:10.193
Yeah, with the sex suit.

10:10.235 --> 10:11.570
The hug suit.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.739
Some people use it
to hug their kids.

10:13.780 --> 10:16.783
Mm-hmm. When's the last time
an adult called it a hug suit?

10:17.826 --> 10:19.453
The commercial.

10:22.205 --> 10:23.790
Ingrid was grossed out by it,

10:23.832 --> 10:26.251
but now it sounds like
she might want to try it.

10:26.293 --> 10:29.504
It's just, now that
I've seen how things are

10:29.546 --> 10:32.924
without the physical,
not sure I want her to.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.303
Well, it's late.

10:36.345 --> 10:40.640
You should get some sleep,
and I got to clock out.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.356
Hey, um...

10:47.397 --> 10:50.776
You want to go back
and see the 2Gigs tomorrow?

10:50.817 --> 10:53.320
Okay.

10:53.362 --> 10:55.405
Good night, Nathan.

10:55.447 --> 10:57.699
Good night, Nora.

11:11.922 --> 11:15.926
Oh, the Vogue interview with you
and Ingrid just dropped.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.677
Oh, how's it look?

11:17.719 --> 11:21.014
It's... intense.

11:21.056 --> 11:23.850
Looks like she's wound
even tighter than she was

11:23.892 --> 11:26.061
at the funeral.

11:26.103 --> 11:28.313
What's going on with that cat?

15:39.147 --> 15:41.191
Everything is properly connected

15:41.232 --> 15:45.362
on our end, so I'll need to test
for responsiveness

15:45.403 --> 15:47.197

15:47.238 --> 15:49.324
Is that okay?

Do you feel that?

16:04.172 --> 16:06.508

Oh, my... What is going on here?

16:23.483 --> 16:27.237
I'm so sorry about that.
My cat was being a total douche.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.864
Oh.

16:29.906 --> 16:32.033
It worked.

16:32.075 --> 16:35.495
So I was like, "Let me test
for responsiveness."

16:35.537 --> 16:38.581
Then I literally threw a blanket
over this girl's head

16:38.623 --> 16:40.792
and felt up her boyfriend.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.753
And... I put on
my sexy voice, too.

16:43.795 --> 16:45.463
You have a sexy voice?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.048
I do.

16:47.090 --> 16:48.675
I said it like this:

16:48.717 --> 16:50.343
"Can you feel anything?"

16:50.385 --> 16:52.345
And I lightly touched his chest

16:52.387 --> 16:56.808
and we locked eyes
and then, holy shit.

16:56.850 --> 16:58.160
You turned his software
into hardware?

16:58.184 --> 17:00.186
- Oh, yeah.
- Girl, and then what happened?

17:00.228 --> 17:03.022
His girlfriend came back and
then he used it on her, so...

17:03.064 --> 17:04.733
Yep.

17:04.774 --> 17:08.236
Dang, that's messed up.
So what about your lady boner?

17:08.278 --> 17:11.489
It's still there. Rock hard.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.366
You know what I'm gonna say,
don't you?

17:13.408 --> 17:15.452
"Give it one more chance
and see where it goes"?

17:15.493 --> 17:17.245
Get the fuck back on Nitely.

17:17.287 --> 17:20.373
Its algorithm is responsible
for tons of real relationships.

17:20.415 --> 17:22.625
- The quickest way
to get over a guy

17:22.667 --> 17:23.918
is to get under a new one.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.840
Reinstall Nitely.

17:31.885 --> 17:33.887
Reinstall Nitely.

17:35.430 --> 17:37.015
See? You already
got a new match.

17:38.975 --> 17:41.561
"Can I cum over?"

17:41.603 --> 17:42.937
It's a pun.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.773
- Look at those abs.
- Those abs.

17:44.814 --> 17:46.691
You know, if I wrote that,

17:46.733 --> 17:49.778
it'd be a deal breaker, right?

17:49.819 --> 17:51.196

18:25.647 --> 18:26.815
say "screams."

18:26.856 --> 18:29.234
"Human manager."

The wait to speak
to a human is 300 minutes.

say "tissue paper."

If a patron is having a baby,
say "miracle."
