WEBVTT

00:02.903 --> 00:04.972
The mashed potatoes
are delicious.

00:05.073 --> 00:07.375
Bob made them.

00:07.475 --> 00:08.376
Well, Betty Crocker
made them,

00:08.476 --> 00:09.477
but Bob added the water.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.445
Gee, thanks, Mom.

00:11.545 --> 00:12.846
<i>Oluwa mi o.</i>

00:12.946 --> 00:15.883
Just put some butter
and salt on 'em.

00:15.983 --> 00:18.386
Yeti is dead.

00:18.486 --> 00:20.521
Auntie Yeti? How?

00:20.621 --> 00:23.857
Heart attack during
water aerobics.

00:23.957 --> 00:25.059
That is horrible.

00:25.159 --> 00:27.728
No one should die
wearing water wings.

00:27.828 --> 00:30.164
I am so sorry about your sister.

00:30.864 --> 00:33.934
Wait, you two are sisters.
Isn't she your sister, too?

00:34.034 --> 00:35.636
No, she was my cousin.

00:35.736 --> 00:36.537
Oh.

00:36.637 --> 00:38.572
I don't understand.

00:38.672 --> 00:41.209
Mummy and Auntie Olu
have the same daddy.

00:41.309 --> 00:42.543
Mummy and Auntie Yeti

00:42.643 --> 00:44.245
have the same mummy.

00:44.345 --> 00:45.579
Mummy and
Auntie Olu's daddy

00:45.679 --> 00:47.781
was related
to Auntie Yeti's daddy.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.618
Maybe you could draw it up
like a football play.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.286
It's not that hard.

00:52.386 --> 00:54.522
A couple has baby Yeti,

00:54.622 --> 00:57.258
then, for some reason,
the dad is out of the picture.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.260
I'm figuring maybe he cheated

00:59.360 --> 01:00.361
or he has a secret
second family.

01:00.461 --> 01:01.862
No, that's allowed over there.

01:01.962 --> 01:03.597
He died of
a staph infection.

01:03.697 --> 01:06.700
But he did have
a secret second family.

01:06.800 --> 01:09.069
So, Mom marries
into a happy harem,

01:09.170 --> 01:10.204
spits out Ebun,

01:10.304 --> 01:11.472
one of
the other wives

01:11.572 --> 01:13.541
drops an Olu, and ta-da!

01:13.641 --> 01:15.309
Now do you understand?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.678
No, I just
regret asking.

01:18.779 --> 01:20.614
I just learned more about
my family in five minutes

01:20.714 --> 01:22.350
than I have
in 15 years.

01:51.279 --> 01:54.582
Abishola, tell Bob
I want to fly to the funeral

01:54.682 --> 01:58.486
in business class.
I cannot grieve in economy.

01:58.586 --> 02:02.055
Mummy, Auntie Yeti's
funeral is in Toronto.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.925
They are not flying her
body back to Nigeria

02:05.025 --> 02:06.494
to be revered
and honored?

02:06.594 --> 02:07.695
When you die,

02:07.795 --> 02:09.797
I will put your body
on a plane to Nigeria

02:09.897 --> 02:11.965
while it is still warm.

02:12.065 --> 02:13.634
Thank you. I raised you well.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.604
It will be cheaper
for Bob to fly me to Toronto,

02:16.704 --> 02:18.639
so make it first class.

02:18.739 --> 02:22.510
You are here from Nigeria
on an American family visa.

02:22.610 --> 02:25.346
It does not permit you
to leave the country.

02:26.214 --> 02:27.748
I am sure there is a way.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.451
Does Bob still have his boat?

02:30.551 --> 02:32.019
I am sorry, Mummy.

02:32.119 --> 02:34.755
If you were an American citizen,
you could go.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.460
You are a citizen.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.094
I am.

02:41.195 --> 02:42.430
Then you will go.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.199
We are manufacturing
our first socks this week.

02:45.299 --> 02:48.101
I did not know
you ran the machines.

02:48.202 --> 02:49.803
This is
a big moment for Bob.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.171
He wants to slide
the first sock

02:51.272 --> 02:53.407
on my foot
like Cinderella.

02:53.507 --> 02:54.442
You will go.

02:54.542 --> 02:56.510
I am also needed
at the hospital.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.611
You will go.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.480
Yes, Mummy.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.349
Dele,

03:01.449 --> 03:02.283
you'll be going with me

03:02.383 --> 03:03.684
to Auntie Yeti's funeral.

03:03.784 --> 03:04.752
But I have school.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.254
You will go.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.369
Kofo.
Goodwin.

03:21.469 --> 03:24.872
I expected you to crawl in
behind Mr. Wheeler.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.374
He's finishing up
a call.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.175
He asked me to set up.

03:33.180 --> 03:35.148
Well, then, set up.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.651
I no longer take
orders from you.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.187
But I am setting up.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.591
Well, thank you very much.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.259
I've got some socks
headed your way.

03:45.359 --> 03:46.860
You sound like a medium.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.796
Yeah, it's a gift.

03:48.896 --> 03:49.930
All right,
bye now.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.199
Immigration lawyer.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.267
I'm trying to get
my mother-in-law

03:53.367 --> 03:54.268
out of the country.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.503
I know she's difficult,

03:55.603 --> 03:57.338
but you don't have
to deport her.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.172
Ebun wants to go to a funeral

03:59.273 --> 04:00.574
in Canada. Oh.

04:00.674 --> 04:03.043
Immigration law
is very confusing.

04:03.143 --> 04:05.346
I have a cousin
I helped get a visa,

04:05.446 --> 04:06.747
and it was not easy.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.616
And I have a cousin
who will never let me

04:08.716 --> 04:10.351
forget it.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.753
I don't understand,
it's just Canada.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.655
I didn't even think
we cared about that border.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.890
You would have never gotten
a visa unless I gave you a job.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.191
Mr. Wheeler gave me the job.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.760
Maybe I'll give Ebun
one of your jobs.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.029
I do not know if that
would solve your problem.

04:22.129 --> 04:24.465
Oh, it would solve one of them.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.369
There's got to be
a palm I can grease.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.237
Be careful accepting help.

04:30.338 --> 04:32.773
Some people may hold it
over your head forever.

04:32.873 --> 04:34.842
Perhaps if some people
showed a little gratitude,

04:34.942 --> 04:36.276
then the other people would not.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.211
Remember the days when
I would come to you for advice

04:38.312 --> 04:39.480
and you'd make fun
of me in Yoruba?

04:39.580 --> 04:41.715
Can't we just go back to that?

04:47.054 --> 04:48.356
We have a new admit

04:48.456 --> 04:49.623
coming in
half an hour.

04:49.723 --> 04:51.459
She requested
a room with a view.

04:51.559 --> 04:52.860
Hmm.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.362
Put her in 402.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.630
She can see the parking lot
behind the Chipotle.

04:57.565 --> 04:59.032
Hello, ladies. Hey.

04:59.132 --> 05:00.100
Hello, Kemi.

05:00.200 --> 05:01.969
Cancel your plan
for the week.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.270
I have something
you will enjoy.

05:03.371 --> 05:05.305
Ooh. Is it a funeral?

05:05.406 --> 05:06.974
That's your guess?

05:07.074 --> 05:09.710
It is a funeral.
That's the answer?

05:10.511 --> 05:12.179
A Nigerian funeral

05:12.279 --> 05:13.947
is a cannot miss event.

05:14.047 --> 05:16.249
Lavish meals, dancing.

05:16.350 --> 05:17.651
It is like a birthday party,

05:17.751 --> 05:19.152
except you don't have
to bring presents

05:19.252 --> 05:21.188
because the person is dead.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.657
And I'm guessing
no candles on the cake.

05:23.757 --> 05:24.658
Mm-hmm.

05:24.758 --> 05:25.926
Who passed away?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.695
My Auntie Yeti.

05:27.795 --> 05:29.863
Oh, that's terrible.

05:29.963 --> 05:31.399
No, it's not.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.868
When Abishola and her ex-husband
first came from Nigeria,

05:34.968 --> 05:36.336
they stayed with Yeti.

05:36.437 --> 05:37.938
It forever changed her.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.640
I know it is
hard to believe,

05:39.740 --> 05:41.742
but this one used to be funny.

05:43.310 --> 05:44.978
Really?

05:45.846 --> 05:48.048
Auntie Yeti forced me
to clean her house,

05:48.148 --> 05:49.950
cook her meals,

05:50.050 --> 05:51.852
and wait on her hand and foot.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.487
I felt like a prisoner.

05:53.587 --> 05:54.922
So, how'd you escape?

05:55.022 --> 05:56.557
Tayo and I moved to Detroit.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.358
I never spoke to her again.

05:58.459 --> 06:00.293
Oh, sweetie.
That's too bad.

06:00.394 --> 06:01.895
Yes, it is.

06:01.995 --> 06:03.196
But a funeral,

06:03.296 --> 06:05.766
what a wonderful surprise.

06:09.737 --> 06:11.171
Neil Armstrong
walked on the Moon,

06:11.271 --> 06:12.840
Steve Jobs
invented the iPhone,

06:12.940 --> 06:15.509
and now the Wheelers have
brought sock manufacturing

06:15.609 --> 06:17.611
back to the good old U.S. of A.

06:17.711 --> 06:18.979
Whoo!

06:19.079 --> 06:21.882
There was a Goodwin Olayiwola
involved as well.

06:21.982 --> 06:24.017
I couldn't have done this
without all of you guys,

06:24.117 --> 06:25.385
which is why I want you here

06:25.486 --> 06:26.620
when we pull
the first sock off the line.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.757
Oh! I haven't been
this excited in years.

06:30.624 --> 06:32.826
Oh, my God,
that's actually true.

06:32.926 --> 06:36.029
Okay, Kofo, record this
so I can show Abishola.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.331
I am already livestreaming
to our legion of sock fans.

06:38.432 --> 06:40.734
Hello, John and Michael.

06:41.702 --> 06:44.371
If you like what you see,
smash the subscribe button.

06:44.472 --> 06:46.840
You didn't tell me
we were gonna be on camera.

06:46.940 --> 06:47.975
Hold on.

06:49.009 --> 06:50.377
Okay, I'm ready.

06:51.344 --> 06:52.580
All right,
let's make sure these meet

06:52.680 --> 06:54.548
the MaxDot seal of approval.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.684
The Lycra,
spandex and cotton

06:56.784 --> 06:58.218
should all be
playing their parts

06:58.318 --> 06:59.720
like a great jazz band.

06:59.820 --> 07:01.489
Yes, and no
part of the sock

07:01.589 --> 07:04.492
should be more bossy or
egocentric than any other.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.128
Mmm, fresh baked sock.

07:08.228 --> 07:09.697
Good elasticity.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.732
The graduated compression
levels are off.

07:11.832 --> 07:14.001
And I'm not
feeling it taper.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.803
But it is still
a good sock.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.037
Good isn't enough.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.438
Really? "Good enough" is

07:18.539 --> 07:20.774
the best compliment
I've ever gotten.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.344
Have you smelled
the sock, Bob?

07:25.913 --> 07:28.549
We can't afford to waste time
trying to figure this out.

07:28.649 --> 07:31.118
If we don't have socks
ready to ship, we're screwed.

07:31.218 --> 07:32.920
Oh, we lost Michael.

07:34.021 --> 07:35.489
Kofo, stop the video.

07:35.589 --> 07:37.290
Everybody out.

07:38.058 --> 07:40.894
As you can see,
perfection is the only

07:40.994 --> 07:43.063
acceptable standard
here at MaxDot.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.765
Kofo, I swear
to God...

07:44.865 --> 07:48.502
Perfection and blasphemy.
I'm turning it off.

07:55.008 --> 07:56.544
Too bad
I am not single.

07:56.644 --> 08:00.413
Men are so sexy
when they are sad.

08:01.549 --> 08:04.618
Why did they not use
a picture of her smiling?

08:05.653 --> 08:07.688
That is her smile.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.456
Since this is
your first funeral,

08:09.557 --> 08:11.659
you should follow my lead.

08:11.759 --> 08:13.193
If people are solemn,

08:13.293 --> 08:14.562
I am solemn.

08:14.662 --> 08:17.531
If they are happy, I am happy.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.967
Welcome, everyone.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.268
Hello.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.604
Hello, Yinka.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.505
I am so glad you are here.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.407
We are so glad
to be here.

08:27.507 --> 08:30.644
You are a natural.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.848
My mother sends her condolences.

08:34.948 --> 08:36.650
Thank you.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.719
Ah, you lived with
Mummy for a while.

08:38.819 --> 08:42.055
That must have been
a wonderful time for you.

08:43.591 --> 08:46.259
My mother sends
her condolences.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.795
Excuse me.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.863
There are so many people
to speak to.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.700
As you know, my mother
was a beloved woman.

08:52.800 --> 08:56.036
I know you
feel that way.

08:59.172 --> 09:00.608
That is done.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.075
Let us go back to the hotel.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.276
Abishola,

09:03.376 --> 09:05.012
we must be respectful.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.479
She was your family.

09:06.580 --> 09:08.582
She never treated me
like family.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.317
And now she is dead.

09:10.417 --> 09:12.185
You have won.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.420
You can pretend

09:13.520 --> 09:15.388
to have loved her
for a couple of days.

09:15.488 --> 09:16.556
Yes.

09:16.657 --> 09:17.958
I despised my husband,

09:18.058 --> 09:20.227
but you should have
seen the performance

09:20.327 --> 09:21.695
I put on at his funeral.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.497
How will I go on?

09:24.598 --> 09:26.333
You took the wrong person.

09:26.433 --> 09:29.002
Why, God, why?

09:30.270 --> 09:31.805
Thank you.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.076
You see? Easy.

09:36.176 --> 09:38.679
She was a horrible,
bitter woman,

09:38.779 --> 09:40.280
and I did not like her.

09:40.380 --> 09:41.715
I doubt anyone
here did.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.084
They are just here
for the food.

09:44.184 --> 09:45.518
Mum.
What?

09:47.154 --> 09:49.489
Oh, Y-Yinka...

09:51.725 --> 09:53.627
This is why I love a funeral.

09:53.727 --> 09:56.797
You never know what
is going to happen.

10:06.173 --> 10:08.008
I have a good feeling
about this one.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.309
I hope so.

10:09.409 --> 10:10.844
If these socks
don't come out right,

10:10.944 --> 10:12.245
we'll all be looking for jobs.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.481
My good feeling is going away.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.551
I got to take this.

10:18.652 --> 10:20.153
Hello.

10:21.121 --> 10:23.090
Yeti is ruining everything.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.325
The dead lady?

10:25.425 --> 10:26.293
Yes.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.761
And she's your mom's cousin?

10:27.861 --> 10:30.097
My mother's sister.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.966
But not your mother's
sister's sister.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.769
Yes, Bob. How hard is it?

10:35.869 --> 10:37.237
Honey, if you're not happy,

10:37.337 --> 10:38.505
get in the car and go.

10:38.605 --> 10:40.307
The woman in the box
won't notice.

10:40.407 --> 10:41.608
I cannot.

10:41.709 --> 10:44.344
I have to set
a good example for my son.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.681
Do you want me
to start the oven?

10:47.781 --> 10:49.049
Don't touch the oven.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.285
I know you are busy.
I should let you go.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.386
Look, I don't know everything

10:53.486 --> 10:54.788
that went on with this lady,

10:54.888 --> 10:56.589
but this is the last time
you're going to see her.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.692
Why not take the high road
and move on with your life?

10:58.792 --> 11:02.730
That awful woman does not
deserve my forgiveness.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.632
Low road it is. Love you.

11:06.934 --> 11:08.736
What did I say
about the oven?!

11:21.314 --> 11:23.583
I am making a soup.

11:23.683 --> 11:28.288
There is no reason to devour
cold cuts like a wild dog.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.689
If you weren't here,

11:29.790 --> 11:31.491
I would have squirted
mustard in my mouth.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.061
Bobby, at
my funeral,

11:34.161 --> 11:36.997
I want an open casket
and an open bar.

11:37.097 --> 11:39.432
I'm sorry, did I miss some news?

11:39.532 --> 11:40.868
It's important
you know my wishes

11:40.968 --> 11:43.570
in case I snap my neck
in the shower tonight.

11:43.670 --> 11:46.039
I got a lot on my plate.
Just take a bath.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.142
The only way to honor
a dead relative

11:49.242 --> 11:50.277
is to make sure

11:50.377 --> 11:52.179
all their last
demands are met.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.414
I want to be buried
in that dress I like.

11:54.514 --> 11:57.851
The low-cut one that was
the talk of my graduation?

11:57.951 --> 11:59.186
Oh, that was a crowd-pleaser.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.354
No, the silver chiffon number.

12:01.454 --> 12:04.591
Well, if it didn't scar me
for life, I don't remember it.

12:04.691 --> 12:05.993
I'll go get it.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.828
No, don't get it now.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.498
Be thankful you will be
able to attend her funeral.

12:11.598 --> 12:13.767
I cannot even say goodbye
to my sister

12:13.867 --> 12:16.569
without being tackled
by border patrol.

12:16.669 --> 12:18.705
I'm sorry, Mama Ebun.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.908
It is fine.

12:21.008 --> 12:23.643
I will see her
again in heaven.

12:23.743 --> 12:27.714
If they let me in with
my American family visa.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.784
You know what, why don't you
come to the factory tomorrow,

12:30.884 --> 12:32.352
help me figure out
these socks?

12:32.452 --> 12:34.788
I do not need you
to babysit me.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.256
I'm not babysitting.

12:36.356 --> 12:38.591
I need someone who can tell me
the truth about things.

12:39.459 --> 12:42.629
That mustache is not
doing you any favors.

12:43.496 --> 12:44.898
Let's stick with socks,

12:44.998 --> 12:46.533
but your head's
in the right place.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.236
What do you think?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.805
Looks good, right?

12:57.077 --> 12:59.079
We should not
be in here.

12:59.179 --> 13:00.380
It is a viewing.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.816
I have to view
what she's wearing.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.184
It is bad luck

13:04.284 --> 13:05.819
to be matchy-matchy
with a dead person.

13:07.855 --> 13:09.222
Oh.

13:10.157 --> 13:12.225
She looks nice.

13:13.726 --> 13:15.428
Lovely silk blend.

13:15.528 --> 13:18.631
They are burying good material.

13:18.731 --> 13:20.633
I can hardly look at the woman.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.336
I know you despise her,

13:23.436 --> 13:24.571
but in a way,

13:24.671 --> 13:26.339
the two of you are very similar.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.575
I am nothing like her.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.343
Don't you think
it was hard for her

13:30.443 --> 13:32.145
being a single mother
living in a different country?

13:32.245 --> 13:34.214
Well, I did it
without being a monster

13:34.314 --> 13:35.582
to everybody around me.

13:35.682 --> 13:37.817
Eh, that depends who you ask.

13:38.785 --> 13:41.254
But you were not alone.
You had me,

13:41.354 --> 13:42.422
and Auntie,

13:42.522 --> 13:45.092
and Uncle, and me.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.561
She had nobody, and yet
she still made room for you.

13:48.661 --> 13:51.398
Tayo and I slept on
a broken futon.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.934
She refused to replace it
until we left.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.439
Ah-ah.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.042
Her shoes look more
expensive than mine.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.410
I have to go shopping.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.946
I will not be upstaged
by a corpse again.

14:07.780 --> 14:09.782
Give me a minute.

14:10.583 --> 14:11.952
Are you going
to put a curse on her?

14:12.052 --> 14:14.054
Kemi, please.

14:14.154 --> 14:15.255
You are right.

14:15.355 --> 14:16.689
Let's save our curses
for the living.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.170
I suppose all these years,

14:30.270 --> 14:32.205
I never considered the situation

14:32.305 --> 14:34.207
you were in when I arrived.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.246
It must have been difficult.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.417
It was for me when Tayo left.

14:45.518 --> 14:46.886
Yes, we divorced.

14:46.987 --> 14:50.457
I know you are delighted
to hear that.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.595
I was so sure my life

14:55.695 --> 14:57.330
would turn out a certain way,

14:57.430 --> 15:00.533
and when it didn't,
I blamed you.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.972
That was not fair.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.876
You were unkind to me.

15:11.711 --> 15:14.447
But I would not have been happy
with anything you did

15:14.547 --> 15:17.517
because I was not
a happy person.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.655
But I am now.

15:23.523 --> 15:25.392
I have a great career,

15:25.492 --> 15:28.028
and a wonderful husband.

15:29.696 --> 15:32.799
I am not the same woman
I was when you knew me.

15:35.602 --> 15:37.370
I deserved better.

15:42.242 --> 15:44.344
But so did you.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.681
I forgive
you, Abishola.

15:50.583 --> 15:53.053
What? I didn't say anything.

15:58.491 --> 15:59.392
You can hang out
in my office

15:59.492 --> 16:00.727
if it's too hot out here.

16:00.827 --> 16:04.297
I like it. The humidity
reminds me of Nigeria.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.799
Great, that's what
I was going for.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.875
I think the sock is finished.

16:16.776 --> 16:20.147
Yep, just saying a little
prayer for good thread density.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.314
I will join you.

16:21.414 --> 16:22.515
Oh, good,
it's better

16:22.615 --> 16:24.317
if he hears
a familiar voice.

16:29.956 --> 16:31.058
Amen.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.492
Amen over here, too.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.994
Okay, let's see
how trial 35 did.

16:35.095 --> 16:35.995
This is 36.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.231
35, you overdid the rayon

16:38.331 --> 16:39.932
and had split seams.

16:40.633 --> 16:43.970
My daughter's future
depends on these socks.

16:44.071 --> 16:45.238
Hey.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.340
Hey, here we go.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.409
All right,
tight toe.

16:49.509 --> 16:50.677
Perfect stitching.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.379
I think you're
my good luck charm.

16:52.479 --> 16:54.347
There is no such thing
as luck.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.748
This was God.

16:55.848 --> 16:57.884
And you.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.153
I guess I had something
to do with it.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.754
Every morning,
I see you

17:01.854 --> 17:03.790
leave early
and come back late.

17:03.890 --> 17:05.525
You would not stop

17:05.625 --> 17:07.994
until you got the sock
that you are holding now.

17:08.095 --> 17:10.163
Took Heinz 57 batches.

17:10.263 --> 17:11.498
Only took me 36.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.634
You take great care of
the things you love.

17:14.734 --> 17:16.836
I am glad my
daughter found you.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.639
Thank you, that means a lot.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.575
I know.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.378
Hey, you want to go out
for a celebration dinner?

17:25.478 --> 17:26.546
Split a bottle of bubbly?

17:26.646 --> 17:28.781
For one sock?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.383
We will eat,

17:30.483 --> 17:32.752
I will take
the champagne home,

17:32.852 --> 17:33.986
and you will come back here

17:34.087 --> 17:36.723
and continue
building our empire.

17:50.237 --> 17:53.406
<i>Kaale,</i> Yinka.
May I speak with you, please?

17:53.506 --> 17:55.775
I think you said
enough yesterday.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.311
I am so sorry.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.281
I wish your mother and I
could have known each other

18:01.381 --> 18:03.183
under different circumstances.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.554
I regret not reaching out
over the years,

18:07.654 --> 18:09.789
but I had no idea
what to say.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.560
You have given her
a wonderful service.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.995
Yes, well...

18:17.397 --> 18:19.199
...thank you for being here.

18:23.803 --> 18:26.439
Your mother would be proud.

18:28.175 --> 18:31.511
Next time, muster up
a couple of tears, hmm?

19:12.652 --> 19:15.322
Abishola,
have some fun.

19:15.422 --> 19:17.824
You're at a funeral.

19:40.079 --> 19:43.550
"The Homegoing
of Oluyeti Olusegun."

19:45.252 --> 19:47.654
Your aunt, your
mother's sister,

19:47.754 --> 19:49.722
and Auntie
Olu's cousin.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.959
Winner, winner,
jollof dinner.

19:53.059 --> 19:57.830
Look at all those people
who loved my sister.

20:12.745 --> 20:15.615
And the flowers
I sent are up front.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.817
I put them
there myself.

20:22.322 --> 20:23.523
That is Auntie Bola.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.558
They had to pry her
off the casket.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.695
She is drawing attention
away from my flowers.

20:34.934 --> 20:37.537
Will you wail like
that when I'm dead?

20:37.637 --> 20:39.339
You got it, waterworks,

20:39.439 --> 20:41.308
open bar
and your silver chiffon.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.343
You do listen to me.
