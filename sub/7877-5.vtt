00:42.960 --> 00:44.097
Do it! Go!

00:45.619 --> 00:48.219
I'm trying to do our taxes!
Quit fooling around down there!

00:48.344 --> 00:50.007
That's not productive at all!

00:50.175 --> 00:51.842
It's a slip 'n' slide, Dad.

00:52.010 --> 00:53.560
Yeah, it's pointless.

00:54.276 --> 00:55.153
Pointless?

00:55.278 --> 00:58.369
It moves us from one side of the yard
to the other on our bellies.

00:58.596 --> 01:00.059
How else would we do that?

01:01.647 --> 01:02.570
What a day.

01:02.695 --> 01:06.126
Being a prison psychiatrist
is harder than I thought it would be.

01:06.251 --> 01:07.360
And these shoes?

01:07.485 --> 01:09.642
No support at all.
100% rubber.

01:09.862 --> 01:13.320
But the state insists I wear a shoe
you can't make a weapon out of.

01:13.445 --> 01:14.466
Go ahead, try.

01:14.591 --> 01:15.700
Can't be done.

01:20.614 --> 01:21.820
Props to you.

01:24.278 --> 01:26.127
I definitely stepped in something.

01:26.832 --> 01:30.443
Stan, the garage door is stuck again.
Can you call the repair people?

01:30.568 --> 01:33.134
I did. They were supposed
to come yesterday. They never showed.

01:33.437 --> 01:36.014
And now I'm upstairs
trying to do our taxes,

01:36.139 --> 01:37.805
and Steve's abusing the hose.

01:38.240 --> 01:40.558
That's embarrassing.
Did you walk in on him?

01:40.895 --> 01:43.144
- What?
- You caught him playing with himself?

01:43.312 --> 01:46.172
Damn it, woman, you always jump to that.
Last time, it was when I said,

01:46.297 --> 01:49.537
- "He's doing his homework".
- I thought you said "bone work".

01:51.042 --> 01:53.154
- Where was I?
- Steve was abusing the hose.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.535
Yes. Spraying it about like a child.

01:55.660 --> 01:57.408
He's turning 14 in two days.

01:57.576 --> 01:59.050
Why can't he act his age?!

01:59.276 --> 02:01.016
He's mature enough, Stan.

02:01.141 --> 02:02.246
- Popsicle fight!

02:02.790 --> 02:04.826
They can't discover
my true identity!

02:04.951 --> 02:06.648
It's the Strawberry Prince!

02:06.773 --> 02:08.580
I cast invisibility!

02:09.701 --> 02:11.229
Where'd he go?

02:19.716 --> 02:22.343
Hey, Mom, did you order
the moonbounce for my birthday?

02:22.468 --> 02:24.629
Yeah, I got the <i>Star Trek</i>Â one.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.423
No, that's not happening.

02:26.548 --> 02:28.910
Yeah, Dad, we're doing
an outer space party.

02:29.035 --> 02:31.942
We're gonna have our faces
painted like aliens and everything.

02:32.594 --> 02:34.174
White people in alien face?

02:34.299 --> 02:36.076
Running around
going "beep-boop-bop"?

02:36.332 --> 02:38.432
Is this what you do
when there's no alien in the room?

02:38.557 --> 02:40.383
How would you feel
if I made fun of you?

02:40.958 --> 02:44.639
"I'm human. I'm from planet earth.
I think I'm coming down with a cold."

02:44.948 --> 02:46.165
Hurts, don't it?

02:46.739 --> 02:49.239
Steve, you're absolutely
not having a space party.

02:49.364 --> 02:50.594
That's childish.

02:50.719 --> 02:52.845
I'll help you think of something
age-appropriate.

02:53.783 --> 02:56.560
When I turned 14,
I took over fiduciary responsibility

02:56.685 --> 02:58.279
for my mother's 401K.

02:58.613 --> 03:01.612
We discussed it over Italian food.
I had my first espresso.

03:01.737 --> 03:04.141
Kept me up all night.
Fell asleep at dawn for five minutes

03:04.266 --> 03:06.477
and had a stress dream
about the house burning down.

03:07.739 --> 03:09.162
Pretty good birthday.

03:11.595 --> 03:14.182
You know what I miss most
about being human?

03:14.934 --> 03:16.197
- Mattering?
- No.

03:16.322 --> 03:18.642
What I miss most
is having my hair cut.

03:18.767 --> 03:20.883
A nice, relaxing trip to the barber.

03:21.008 --> 03:22.911
The shampoo, the conditioner.

03:23.294 --> 03:24.933
Inspecting theÂ <i>FrÃ¤ulein</i>

03:25.058 --> 03:27.708
in the latest issue
ofÂ <i>Guten Tag</i> vagina.

03:34.868 --> 03:36.257
Welcome, Steve's friend.

03:36.841 --> 03:39.593
Grab a cup of coffee.
The entertainment's about to begin.

03:41.324 --> 03:44.056
Listen up. This is Harvey.
He's gonna take it from here.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.366
What would you say
to a life insurance policy

03:47.491 --> 03:49.910
where all your premiums
were returned to you

03:50.035 --> 03:51.974
on your 72nd birthday?

03:53.597 --> 03:54.942
What would you say?

03:57.986 --> 04:00.030
And you'd be right to be excited!

04:00.632 --> 04:03.431
As future homeowners,
you'll need to properly insulate.

04:03.556 --> 04:05.177
Go ahead, touch the wall.

04:05.621 --> 04:08.166
It's cool to the touch,
even though it's hot outside.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.040
- Can we go outside?
- No.

04:10.208 --> 04:12.238
Let's move on to weather stripping.

04:21.303 --> 04:24.631
You were ruining Steve's party,
so I called the moonbounce guys.

04:25.967 --> 04:29.381
Steve's childhood is over, and you need
to get used to it, just like he does.

04:34.758 --> 04:36.066
Steve, get out!

04:40.178 --> 04:43.982
You're an adult, and you will act like
and be treated like an adult.

04:54.377 --> 04:55.947
Look how high I'm going!

04:59.305 --> 05:01.332
This... This is, this is so much...

05:01.874 --> 05:03.319
This is so much fun!

05:11.659 --> 05:12.709
Oh, God!

05:13.365 --> 05:14.624
Oh, God!

05:14.893 --> 05:16.032
What's wrong?

05:16.157 --> 05:17.707
Is there no cake?

05:17.832 --> 05:19.058
Oh, God!

05:19.183 --> 05:21.320
Oh, God!

05:30.365 --> 05:32.331
Yeah, being crazy is very tiring.

05:33.208 --> 05:34.588
What? He went off his bean.

05:34.713 --> 05:36.835
He's been out there for two days.
Is he even eating?

05:37.003 --> 05:39.420
I put a sandwich out by the bouncer
and when I went back,

05:39.545 --> 05:41.090
- it was gone.
- I ate that.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.502
You know I have a thing
where I have to eat any food I find.

05:45.857 --> 05:47.888
Maybe if I was fed better.
I don't know.

05:48.013 --> 05:51.333
Will you put on your psychiatrist
costume and talk to him?

05:51.458 --> 05:53.000
I'm kind of making a pizza.

05:53.125 --> 05:55.154
- I'll pay you $75.
- A hundred.

05:58.668 --> 06:00.526
- You having fun?
- I'm not coming out!

06:00.883 --> 06:03.779
- Mind if I bounce with you a little?
- I guess not.

06:06.728 --> 06:07.728
Kind of...

06:11.485 --> 06:13.127
First, a medical question.

06:13.252 --> 06:15.149
Where have you been going
to the bathroom?

06:15.274 --> 06:19.086
These are new socks and I paid extra
for monogramming is all. See?

06:20.457 --> 06:22.172
That's not a monogram,
that's a penguin.

06:22.431 --> 06:23.632
My name is Dr. Penguin.

06:23.934 --> 06:25.948
Anywho, it's my professional opinion

06:26.073 --> 06:28.333
that this is a case
of Pavlovian conditioning.

06:28.458 --> 06:30.514
- Are you salivating?
- Get away from me!

06:31.525 --> 06:33.990
Patient is hostile
but salivating normally.

06:34.115 --> 06:37.938
Recommend a micro lobotomy performed
with either green or red lasers.

06:38.106 --> 06:40.129
Cut the crap.
There's nothing wrong with me.

06:40.254 --> 06:42.373
I've never been
in a moonbounce before.

06:42.498 --> 06:43.740
That's no surprise.

06:43.865 --> 06:46.364
Your father walked out on you
when you were four.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.131
You inherited
all of his responsibilities.

06:49.256 --> 06:51.118
You never really had a childhood.

06:52.730 --> 06:53.704
I didn't?

06:54.070 --> 06:55.893
No. You're in way over your head.

06:56.018 --> 06:58.917
As we grow,
we pass certain milestones.

07:00.114 --> 07:04.064
You skipped the milestones of youth.
That's why you can't get out of here.

07:04.189 --> 07:06.383
Your inner child
is putting his foot down.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.510
I don't know.
That sounds like mumbojumbo.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.691
It is.
Dr. Mumbojumbo was my mentor

07:10.816 --> 07:13.095
at the people's hospital
in Cameroon.

07:14.425 --> 07:16.234
If you deny your inner child,

07:16.359 --> 07:18.312
you'll never be
a well-adjusted adult.

07:20.232 --> 07:23.250
You just need a little dose of fun.
Go out and act like a kid.

07:23.375 --> 07:26.168
Wipe your nose on your sleeve,
eat Cheerios out of a baggie,

07:26.293 --> 07:28.184
touch a urinal then touch your face.

07:28.931 --> 07:31.240
Ride the back of a dog
and pretend it's a pony,

07:31.365 --> 07:33.659
- get an ear infection.
- All right, I understand.

07:33.784 --> 07:36.807
Spit on a jellyfish, get a stuffed
rabbit and name it Rabbito,

07:36.932 --> 07:38.913
touch penises with a neighbor boy.

07:40.641 --> 07:42.701
I was thinking about what you said.

07:44.222 --> 07:45.368
It's a doll wig.

07:45.493 --> 07:48.854
I thought if it's what you miss most,
why don't I give you a haircut?

07:48.979 --> 07:50.153
It's beautiful.

07:50.714 --> 07:51.540
May I?

07:53.173 --> 07:55.124
Sweet, luxurious hair.

07:55.971 --> 07:58.464
Maybe you could cut my hair
like Ryan Phillippe's.

07:59.001 --> 08:01.438
I can't really remember
how he wears his.

08:02.023 --> 08:02.837
Shoot.

08:03.595 --> 08:05.943
Luckily, I have six pictures of him
right here.

08:07.102 --> 08:09.134
- That's...
- Creepy. Yes, I know.

08:18.785 --> 08:21.147
- Where's your car?
- I sold it and bought my elephant.

08:21.272 --> 08:23.627
But you can't get around
on the elephant.

08:23.795 --> 08:26.773
Then you don't know the power
of a child's imagination.

08:26.898 --> 08:28.507
To the stars, Shorbu!

08:32.297 --> 08:36.030
Stan, you still got to finish the taxes
and fix the garage door.

08:36.155 --> 08:40.054
How long is this "getting in touch with
your inner child" thing gonna take?

08:40.179 --> 08:42.698
I don't know.
How long did <i>Billy Madison</i> last?

08:42.823 --> 08:43.626
Forever?

08:44.318 --> 08:45.977
It felt like forever.

09:11.289 --> 09:12.801
Go, Dad!
You're doing it!

09:14.470 --> 09:16.471
300 points! All right!

09:17.473 --> 09:18.473
Ten million.

09:18.856 --> 09:20.105
Who is A.S.S?

09:20.417 --> 09:23.007
Wait, that spells...
Oh, my God, that spells "ass"!

09:23.132 --> 09:24.382
That's me, Dad.

09:24.535 --> 09:26.305
But your initials are S.A.S.

09:26.589 --> 09:28.256
- Was that a mistake?
- Nope.

09:28.381 --> 09:29.538
On purpose.

09:29.663 --> 09:31.987
That... is... hilarious.

09:32.112 --> 09:34.001
That's hilarious!
It's a joke!

09:34.832 --> 09:35.991
That's hilarious.

09:38.995 --> 09:40.633
Out of the way, twerp.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.139
I hate that senior.

09:44.264 --> 09:46.007
- Who is he?
- Henry Calloway.

09:46.132 --> 09:49.346
He thinks he's so cool because
his rock band plays the sororities

09:49.471 --> 09:51.321
and he's always having so much sex.

09:51.446 --> 09:52.851
We should egg his house.

09:52.976 --> 09:55.219
We totally should!
I've never done any egging.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.454
Awesome!
Father-son egging!

09:57.579 --> 09:59.681
- Has that ever been done?
- Probably!

09:59.849 --> 10:02.017
Well, can you sneak out tonight?

10:02.185 --> 10:05.395
I don't have to. That's one
of the good things about being adult.

10:05.563 --> 10:08.761
Holy moly, the streetlights are on!
I'm supposed to be home!

10:41.565 --> 10:42.391
Well?

10:44.186 --> 10:45.586
What do you think?

10:47.108 --> 10:48.496
Can I see the back?

10:49.765 --> 10:51.224
You butchered my hair!

10:51.511 --> 10:53.522
Which of these photos did you use?

10:53.905 --> 10:56.238
Well, all.
They're from different angles.

10:56.406 --> 10:58.244
"From different angles"?

10:58.473 --> 11:00.367
Oh, God.
I'm going to be sick.

11:00.698 --> 11:02.744
It'll be fine.
Just let it settle.

11:03.023 --> 11:05.427
Settling is what I did
when I had you cut it.

11:05.552 --> 11:07.824
God, I was just trying
to be nice to you.

11:07.949 --> 11:08.973
Life...

11:09.098 --> 11:10.666
is not worth living!

11:11.087 --> 11:12.887
Klaus, no! It's not worth it.

11:13.975 --> 11:16.141
Suffer for your crimes!

11:21.239 --> 11:23.240
Hey, you guys ready to do the eggs?

11:23.365 --> 11:24.815
- Yeah.
- Totally.

11:26.799 --> 11:28.318
They'll never find these.

11:34.149 --> 11:35.149
Suck it!

11:36.390 --> 11:37.095
Run!

11:37.220 --> 11:40.204
Guys, you don't need to run.
The police are our friends.

11:47.745 --> 11:49.073
You kids are too young

11:49.198 --> 11:52.183
to remember
the toilet paper shortage of '43.

11:52.588 --> 11:54.908
We were sending so many rolls
to our boys overseas

11:55.033 --> 11:57.874
that our own posteriors
were left unattended.

11:58.233 --> 12:00.762
I'm talking anuses caked
in a crust of human waste.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.346
Do I make myself clear?

12:03.173 --> 12:04.431
Yes, your honor.

12:04.599 --> 12:07.851
Since then, TPing has been
a criminal act in virginia.

12:08.180 --> 12:10.594
However, taking your age
into account,

12:10.719 --> 12:13.607
I've decided just to give you
a slap on the wrist.

12:14.943 --> 12:17.062
You're getting 20 hours
community service.

12:17.187 --> 12:18.612
You're getting 20 hours.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.198
You're getting three months
in Chimdale prison.

12:21.366 --> 12:23.432
And you two are getting 20 hours.

12:23.928 --> 12:26.828
Three months?
But I was just acting like a kid!

12:27.151 --> 12:30.207
According to this,
you are 42 years old.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.102
But Chimdale prison?

12:32.495 --> 12:34.836
I'll never make it there.
God, I'll never make it there.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.131
You'll make it.

12:36.256 --> 12:40.050
We have a free bus that drives you
right to the facility.

12:46.993 --> 12:49.652
I know.
I had so much more kid stuff to do.

12:49.777 --> 12:52.453
No, I mean,
what are we going to do without you?

12:52.578 --> 12:55.076
Don't worry. I'll be out
in a month with good behavior.

12:55.201 --> 12:57.892
- But our taxes are due.
- I can do them, Mom.

12:58.017 --> 13:00.118
I'll take care of things
while you're away, dad.

13:00.243 --> 13:01.486
Look at that.

13:01.611 --> 13:03.817
I knew I could count on you, Steve.

13:04.195 --> 13:05.858
Sir, would you mind hugging my son?

13:05.983 --> 13:08.009
I'm very proud of him
at this moment,

13:08.134 --> 13:09.943
- but my hands...
- Not a problem.

13:10.068 --> 13:12.872
I'm hugging so many people
at this job, it's crazy.

13:17.492 --> 13:19.965
You can do this.
Just keep your head down,

13:20.133 --> 13:22.566
and spread the rumor
that your sphincter has teeth.

13:27.883 --> 13:30.475
Hey, new guy.
You think you can take us?

13:30.643 --> 13:33.252
- Look, I don't want any trouble.
- It's no trouble.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.260
All right.

13:37.745 --> 13:39.025
Let him have it, Wesley.

13:41.014 --> 13:42.112
Are you all right?

13:42.280 --> 13:44.312
We have the squash court
reserved for an hour.

13:44.437 --> 13:45.999
Want to go knock it around?

13:46.899 --> 13:48.447
Yeah, yeah. That'd be nice.

13:48.848 --> 13:50.605
Wait, are you Wesley Snipes?

13:51.634 --> 13:53.460
A lot of people ask me that.

13:53.585 --> 13:54.566
Yes, I am.

13:59.277 --> 14:01.347
Good game.
You guys play every day?

14:02.047 --> 14:04.718
One of the perks of being
in a minimum-security prison.

14:05.673 --> 14:07.360
Passion fruit iced tea?

14:07.485 --> 14:10.117
- Thanks, Rivers.
- You guys have it great here.

14:10.242 --> 14:11.224
We do. We do.

14:11.392 --> 14:13.518
The warden's an ass,
but other than that,

14:13.643 --> 14:15.395
it's like... camp for adults.

14:16.396 --> 14:20.183
So, in here, a guy
could act like a kid if he wanted.

14:21.277 --> 14:22.467
Phone call.

14:23.542 --> 14:24.362
Y'ello.

14:24.852 --> 14:25.722
Hi, Dad.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.201
Are you still claiming
60% business use on your car?

14:29.369 --> 14:31.203
I sold it
and bought a flying elephant.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.205
I know, but this is for last year.

14:36.300 --> 14:37.542
I'll just put 60.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.252
That sounds good.
See you.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.405
And do you know where the schematic
diagram of the dishwasher is?

14:42.530 --> 14:45.153
I can find the warranty card,
but not the schematic.

14:45.278 --> 14:47.449
A little plastic piece
in the lower tray broke.

14:47.574 --> 14:49.554
I need the item number
to order a new piece.

14:49.722 --> 14:50.497
Right.

14:51.562 --> 14:54.139
I tried describing the piece
to the lady on the sears helpline,

14:54.264 --> 14:55.771
but it's hard, you know?

14:55.896 --> 14:59.006
It's a small gray piece,
maybe three inches long

14:59.131 --> 15:01.423
with these little prongs
that clip into the lower tray

15:01.548 --> 15:03.612
so you can adjust some
of the uprights to hold,

15:03.737 --> 15:05.515
like bowls and larger things,

15:05.640 --> 15:09.037
or just regular-sized plates if you
leave the poles in the down position.

15:09.162 --> 15:10.607
You know the piece?

15:10.732 --> 15:13.811
See, it's pretty hard to describe,
so I'm looking for the schematic.

15:15.287 --> 15:16.623
<i>Dad? Are you there?</i>

15:18.333 --> 15:19.334
<i>Excuse me.</i>

15:42.426 --> 15:45.610
All right, guys, you know
I don't want to be the bad guy.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.813
That's not why I became
a warden of a prison, okay?

15:48.938 --> 15:50.346
But a food fight?

15:50.699 --> 15:53.702
Come on.
Food belongs in your tummies.

15:53.870 --> 15:54.953
We didn't start it.

15:56.299 --> 15:58.296
I'm trying to help you out here.

15:58.421 --> 16:01.612
And it's hard for me to even say it,
it sounds so negative,

16:01.737 --> 16:04.037
but if you guys can't reel
in your shenanigans,

16:04.162 --> 16:06.616
you won't be eligible
for an early release.

16:10.399 --> 16:12.205
Okay, that right there.
That's funny.

16:12.330 --> 16:14.081
I deserve that.
But, seriously,

16:14.206 --> 16:17.828
the next parole board meets right after
the guard-inmate kickball game tomorrow

16:17.953 --> 16:20.206
and I don't want anyone
to blow their chances.

16:20.331 --> 16:21.610
Now, get out of here.

16:21.735 --> 16:24.217
Go get some pizza.
I had it delivered to your cells.

16:26.098 --> 16:27.783
Was I too hard on them, Chirpy?

16:28.097 --> 16:29.120
Warden sucks.

16:29.245 --> 16:30.317
You rascal.

16:31.269 --> 16:32.768
That is good fun.

16:33.464 --> 16:34.706
I hate that warden.

16:34.831 --> 16:38.006
Sending us pizzas,
covering for us when we screw up.

16:38.179 --> 16:41.249
I get it. You're the good guy.
I'm the criminal.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.617
- Well, we are in prison.
- So is he.

16:44.184 --> 16:45.045
So is he.

16:45.213 --> 16:48.819
The worst thing is, he's always
pushing for our early release.

16:48.944 --> 16:52.385
- I don't want to go anywhere.
- Me, neither. This place is awesome.

16:53.751 --> 16:56.660
If we pull off this prank
at the kickball game,

16:56.785 --> 16:59.184
there's no way
they'll let us out early.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.597
When the warden comes up to kick,

17:03.722 --> 17:06.816
- we put hornets in the ball.
- How can you put hornets in a ball?

17:07.596 --> 17:09.027
We paint this red.

17:09.423 --> 17:11.631
- Can i do the painting?
- I don't know, Wes.

17:11.756 --> 17:14.444
We let you paint the chair
we made for my nephew.

17:14.733 --> 17:16.419
It was pretty sloppy work.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.638
How you holding up, Stan?

17:21.763 --> 17:23.040
It's great in here.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.794
What? But...
You'll be out soon, right?

17:25.962 --> 17:28.046
Maybe not.
Why didn't Steve come?

17:28.214 --> 17:29.464
Steve's right here.

17:29.589 --> 17:32.837
Okay, first of all, you were supposed
to fix the garage door yesterday

17:32.962 --> 17:34.448
between 3:00 and 5:00.

17:34.573 --> 17:35.982
You never showed.

17:36.107 --> 17:38.080
Then I was told by...

17:38.497 --> 17:41.800
Robert, who wouldn't give me
his last name or extension,

17:41.925 --> 17:43.882
that I would be
the first appointment today.

17:44.007 --> 17:45.712
I waited in my house until 3:15.

17:45.837 --> 17:48.069
I almost missed my father's
prison kickball game.

17:48.194 --> 17:49.799
You need to make this right!

17:51.663 --> 17:54.455
- You look terrible.
- He's running himself ragged,

17:54.580 --> 17:56.097
being the man of the house.

17:56.222 --> 17:57.791
Hey, Smith, let's play!

17:58.167 --> 18:00.328
Get out there, Dad.
Go have some fun.

18:02.206 --> 18:05.333
The warden kicks first.
You don't want to miss this.

18:05.770 --> 18:07.168
How do you want it?

18:07.336 --> 18:09.239
Slow and bouncy and over the plate.

18:09.364 --> 18:12.257
But whatever you do will be good enough.
'Cause I know you're trying.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.464
I hate you.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.272
<i>If we pull off this prank
at the kickball game,</i>

18:18.397 --> 18:20.648
<i>there's no way
they'll let us out early.</i>

18:20.773 --> 18:22.792
<i>There's no way
they'll let us out early.</i>

18:22.917 --> 18:24.936
<i>There's no way
they'll let us out early.</i>

18:50.983 --> 18:53.190
Are you sure it looks okay?

18:53.315 --> 18:56.384
Yes. It looks really good.
You've...

18:56.552 --> 18:59.804
You've got the ladybug barrette
in there and...

19:02.922 --> 19:05.010
It's terrible, isn't it?

19:05.695 --> 19:08.028
- Isn't it?
- Yes! It's awful!

19:08.153 --> 19:09.610
It's so awful!

19:20.910 --> 19:24.913
And I realize nothing I do now
is going to fix my crummy childhood,

19:25.081 --> 19:27.114
but I don't want to wreck my son's.

19:27.641 --> 19:29.621
So, vote how you have to today.

19:29.746 --> 19:32.209
I'm keeping my nose clean
from here on out.

19:34.364 --> 19:36.174
I just hope it's not too late.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.805
Beautiful, Mr. Smith.

19:38.930 --> 19:41.889
I think I speak for everyone
when I say immediate release

19:42.014 --> 19:44.224
- would be the best...
- Not for everyone, Charlie.

19:45.905 --> 19:47.171
Not for everyone.

19:48.297 --> 19:51.530
Crocodile tears, Mr. Smith.
And you're not fooling me.

19:51.819 --> 19:54.717
No, if we let you out now,
it ends in one of two ways.

19:54.842 --> 19:57.748
Complete rehabilitation,
or you'll just get in trouble again.

19:57.873 --> 20:00.031
And I don't like those odds.
Parole denied.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.950
I'll kill you!
You're a dead man!

20:03.664 --> 20:04.818
See? Maniac.

20:05.606 --> 20:07.033
This is a good bagel.

20:07.196 --> 20:08.775
Probably 'cause it's a donut.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.375
What are you doing after this?

20:21.137 --> 20:22.587
This is the place.

20:27.805 --> 20:28.969
There he is!

20:29.094 --> 20:31.607
You owe me big, Mr. Hard Time.

20:31.732 --> 20:33.761
Who got you two more months
of goofing around?

20:33.886 --> 20:36.401
I did, is who.
Get inside this hug.

20:39.172 --> 20:42.005
- Welcome home, honey.
- It's good to have you back.

20:42.130 --> 20:43.286
Where's my boy?

20:46.729 --> 20:47.761
Who's there?

20:48.440 --> 20:49.647
It's me, son.

20:49.772 --> 20:51.241
Put down those papers.

20:51.366 --> 20:52.494
Look out back.

20:53.375 --> 20:54.487
What is it?

20:55.469 --> 20:57.314
It's a slip 'n' slide, son.

20:57.439 --> 20:59.289
And I want you to play on it.

20:59.414 --> 21:01.259
For as long as you want.
