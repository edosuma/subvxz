00:03.836 --> 00:06.507
Welcome to
the Smithsonian Anthropology lab.

00:06.757 --> 00:10.969
l'm Dr. Elaine Burns, and you're
watching the Recovery Channel.

00:11.178 --> 00:15.307
Tonight we'll be opening
a time capsule from the Civil War.

00:15.516 --> 00:17.184
Lights, please.

00:17.643 --> 00:22.022
This iron casket represents
one of America's first uses of rubber

00:22.231 --> 00:25.984
in an industrial process,
sealing in the dead

00:26.235 --> 00:28.445
from the ravages of weather
and time.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.781
Now, what makes this one
particularly special

00:31.031 --> 00:34.868
is that all of its seals
were found to be fully intact.

00:35.661 --> 00:37.037
Gentlemen.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.544
What we're hoping to find inside

00:43.710 --> 00:47.047
are some of the best preserved
remains from the Civil War era.

00:49.341 --> 00:50.634
This is unbelievable.

00:51.260 --> 00:55.556
This type of preservation is unheard of
in a 1 40-year-old body.

00:55.806 --> 00:57.766
Joe, we have a problem.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.144
- Dr. Burns?
- Yes?

01:01.395 --> 01:04.647
l don't think they carried those
in the Civil War.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.218
l freaking hate Mondays.

02:10.347 --> 02:13.184
Frigging Fat Al's
All-You-Can-Eat Burrito Shack.

02:14.351 --> 02:18.481
More like Fat Al's bacteria shack.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.318
Come on.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.614
l shouldn't have come in to work today.
Gibbs sees me like this--

02:26.822 --> 02:31.035
He'll probably be as horrified as l am,
Agent DiNozzo.

02:33.329 --> 02:35.331
Working undercover as a hobo?

02:39.627 --> 02:42.379
You mind telling me
what you're doing here again?

02:44.048 --> 02:45.424
Waiting.

02:45.633 --> 02:47.676
- For what?
- To start work.

02:48.094 --> 02:50.388
Does everyone always come in
this late?

02:50.638 --> 02:52.473
lt's 0700.

02:52.723 --> 02:55.643
- At Mossad we start at 0500.
- Okay.

02:57.770 --> 03:00.648
Let me rephrase
the original question.

03:01.107 --> 03:03.567
What the hell are you doing here,
Ziva?

03:03.776 --> 03:05.069
l see.

03:07.029 --> 03:08.656
Gibbs didn't tell you.

03:08.906 --> 03:10.116
Tell me what?

03:10.366 --> 03:13.994
Mossad's assigned me to NClS
as a liaison officer.

03:14.245 --> 03:16.414
We're gonna be working together.

03:17.248 --> 03:20.543
- Does Gibbs know about this?
- Do you think l'd be here if he didn't?

03:27.383 --> 03:30.803
You might want to do something
about your hair.

03:31.053 --> 03:35.182
lt's sticking up like a porcu-swine.
Wrong word. Like a porcu-pig.

03:35.891 --> 03:38.102
The little animal
with the little spikies, yes. The--

03:38.352 --> 03:40.604
- Porcupine.
- Porcupine.

03:40.855 --> 03:43.399
Thank you, Special Agent McGee.

03:45.776 --> 03:48.279
Sure.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.699
Anyone have a key for this?

03:52.950 --> 03:54.535
That's Kate's desk.

03:54.785 --> 03:57.788
Okay, but if l'm going to be a part
of your team l would love to--

03:58.038 --> 04:00.249
Whoa. You're part of our team?

04:01.625 --> 04:03.210
Yes.

04:03.961 --> 04:06.255
- Did Gibbs tell you about this?
- Nope.

04:08.841 --> 04:10.634
Here are my orders.

04:10.926 --> 04:13.262
Signed by Director Shepard.

04:17.850 --> 04:20.101
- You think Gibbs knows?
- l hope so.

04:20.351 --> 04:22.396
All my personal possessions
are now being shipped

04:22.646 --> 04:24.398
from Tel Aviv to Washington.

04:24.648 --> 04:28.569
l'd hold off on unpacking
the waffle iron till you talk to him, Ziva.

04:28.819 --> 04:31.822
- When's he come in?
- Now.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.827
Special Agent Gibbs.

04:37.328 --> 04:38.913
Ziva.

04:46.295 --> 04:47.671
What are you doing here?

04:47.838 --> 04:50.049
Looking forward to being a member
of your team.

05:00.726 --> 05:05.564
l stand corrected.
lt appears he didn't know.

05:05.773 --> 05:07.483
l feel like a donkey's butt.

05:08.401 --> 05:11.487
- A donkey's butt?
- l think she meant horse's ass.

05:11.695 --> 05:13.447
Yes, that too.

05:23.541 --> 05:27.670
Something l can help you with
this morning, Special Agent Gibbs?

05:30.464 --> 05:34.510
Yeah. l've got a personnel issue.
You know anything about that?

05:36.345 --> 05:39.724
l take it Ziva arrived
a few days early?

05:40.224 --> 05:45.146
Right. Before we get into this,
l'm gonna need a refill.

05:51.736 --> 05:53.821
That was sweet,
not necessarily sanitary.

05:54.071 --> 05:56.282
What is she doing here, Jen?

05:56.490 --> 05:59.034
lf we're going to fight
a global war on terror

05:59.285 --> 06:01.287
we need to work closely
with our allies.

06:01.537 --> 06:03.748
Well, that sounds good.
Put her on somebody else's team.

06:03.998 --> 06:05.541
l want her with you, Jethro.

06:05.750 --> 06:09.587
Mossad trained her to spy and kill,
not to investigate crime scenes.

06:09.837 --> 06:12.006
Send her to the ClA.

06:12.256 --> 06:17.386
Just to be clear, this is not a request
or a debate, Agent Gibbs.

06:20.306 --> 06:23.934
Anything else you wanna change
about my team while l'm here?

06:24.852 --> 06:26.812
Look, if anything,
you're lucky to have her.

06:27.313 --> 06:29.482
She's one of the finest agents
l worked with in Europe.

06:29.732 --> 06:34.487
- Why didn't you ask me first, Jen?
- And what would you have said?

06:35.196 --> 06:37.073
Exactly.

06:37.698 --> 06:42.203
Number 1 8, it's better to seek
forgiveness than ask permission.

06:42.453 --> 06:45.539
Oh, that's real nice. Using the rules
l taught you against me.

06:46.540 --> 06:47.583
Nice touch.

06:47.833 --> 06:52.296
l learned from the best, Jethro.
l want Ziva to as well.

07:00.012 --> 07:01.806
You want something to read?

07:04.058 --> 07:05.226
What do you have?

07:09.688 --> 07:12.691
<i>GSM. lt's a men's magazine.</i>

07:13.150 --> 07:16.654
Most women find it objectifies them.

07:21.867 --> 07:26.163
l read it on the plane.
l especially like the article on page 57.

07:27.123 --> 07:31.085
ln my experience,
it works every time.

07:34.797 --> 07:38.342
l always thought
that was urban legend.

07:47.268 --> 07:48.644
What's the verdict?

07:50.646 --> 07:52.356
Pack your trash.

07:54.024 --> 07:55.401
Not a problem.

07:57.611 --> 07:59.655
Most of it doesn't arrive
till next week.

08:04.660 --> 08:05.870
Nice seeing you again, Tony.

08:09.373 --> 08:10.958
McGee.

08:22.970 --> 08:25.806
l told you to pack your trash, Ziva.

08:26.057 --> 08:29.977
l don't remember giving you
permission to leave yet.

08:36.692 --> 08:38.568
- You requested this assignment?
- l did.

08:38.818 --> 08:40.279
Why?

08:41.197 --> 08:42.907
l had to get away from Mossad
for a while.

08:44.075 --> 08:46.994
- You believe what Ari said?
- No.

08:48.913 --> 08:50.498
Yes.

08:51.582 --> 08:53.125
Maybe.

08:53.709 --> 08:56.712
Your brother was a Svengali, Ziva.

08:57.546 --> 08:58.923
Like father, like son.

08:59.173 --> 09:02.301
- Does Mossad know you killed Ari?
- No. They believe your report.

09:04.095 --> 09:06.097
Only you and l know the truth.

09:08.015 --> 09:10.142
For that l thank you.

09:13.020 --> 09:14.897
l trust you. You know that.

09:15.648 --> 09:18.609
- But when we leave this elevator--
- You start kicking my butt.

09:18.859 --> 09:22.279
l don't kick butt.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.964
Ms. David will be with us for a while.

09:43.509 --> 09:44.885
That's Kate's desk.

09:45.094 --> 09:47.096
Yours is down at the end.

09:49.724 --> 09:51.267
He's a tough one to read.

09:51.517 --> 09:54.603
You'll find most NClS agents
are like that. lt's our training.

09:54.812 --> 09:56.105
ls that a fact?

09:56.689 --> 10:00.276
We never let other people
know what we're thinking.

10:01.193 --> 10:04.613
Right now you're thinking
of doing page 57 with me.

10:11.537 --> 10:14.081
Boss, we have a situation
at the Smithsonian Museum.

10:14.331 --> 10:15.499
What?

10:15.750 --> 10:18.919
Well, it's kind of complicated,
but there may have been a murder.

10:19.170 --> 10:20.337
May have been, McGee?

10:20.588 --> 10:23.340
Yeah, well, they have a Union soldier
who was dug up

10:23.549 --> 10:26.969
from a battlefield in Manassas. Now
they think that he may be a Marine.

10:27.219 --> 10:30.139
lt was the Civil War, McGee.
Marines fought on both sides.

10:30.389 --> 10:33.517
l know. But this Marine had dog tags.
Didn't exist back then.

10:34.894 --> 10:37.730
- You know that, being a Marine.
- Get to the point, McGee.

10:37.980 --> 10:39.815
They think that this Marine
was killed recently

10:40.066 --> 10:43.652
and somehow buried in a way--
They can't quite explain it,

10:43.903 --> 10:46.822
but in a 1 40-year-old
cast-iron sarcophagus.

10:47.073 --> 10:48.783
Dressed as a Union soldier?

10:49.200 --> 10:50.493
Basically, yeah.

10:53.412 --> 10:55.956
Gas the truck, McGee. DiNozzo.
Yeah, boss.

10:56.290 --> 10:58.334
l've got a murder
in your area of expertise.

10:58.584 --> 11:00.878
This happens a lot, me being
a Senior Field Agent and all.

11:01.128 --> 11:02.797
l'm sure it does.

11:03.047 --> 11:05.508
- What do we got? Multiple homicides?
- No.

11:05.758 --> 11:07.426
- Gang related?
- No.

11:07.802 --> 11:09.261
Defenestration?

11:10.221 --> 11:11.597
The Civil War.

11:13.099 --> 11:16.227
l can hardly wait.
lt's my favourite subject.

11:17.395 --> 11:18.562
What about me?

11:18.771 --> 11:20.856
You're coming along strictly
as an observer.

11:21.107 --> 11:23.109
Hand over all your weapons.

11:25.319 --> 11:26.987
ls that really necessary?

11:27.947 --> 11:29.740
Right.

11:35.287 --> 11:36.455
- Your backup.
- What backup?

11:36.664 --> 11:38.207
Left leg.

11:38.624 --> 11:40.167
That one.

11:45.881 --> 11:48.384
And the knife
concealed at your waist.

11:57.309 --> 11:59.145
You can keep this.

12:01.313 --> 12:03.607
l just want you to know that l know.

12:05.526 --> 12:07.069
According to his dog tags

12:07.278 --> 12:11.240
this young man
is Warren Sorrow, USMC.

12:12.616 --> 12:14.076
How long has he been in there?

12:14.285 --> 12:19.707
He's remarkably well-preserved.
Could be months or even years.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.793
We'll know more
when we get him home.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.587
You know, in the 1 970s,

12:24.837 --> 12:28.007
grave robbers raided
a Southern colonel's cast-iron casket.

12:29.050 --> 12:31.886
They took his weapons, his jewellry,
and for some strange reason,

12:32.136 --> 12:33.179
the poor man's head.

12:34.555 --> 12:38.017
When the local authorities found
the 1 00-year-old decomposing corpse

12:38.309 --> 12:41.145
they assumed
he was recently decapitated

12:41.395 --> 12:43.355
and opened a murder investigation.

12:43.606 --> 12:45.316
He's still got his head.
We're not local cops.

12:45.566 --> 12:48.402
- l wanna know how he died.
- l can help with that.

12:50.196 --> 12:53.532
Dr. Mallard.
Well, how nice to see you again.

12:53.783 --> 12:55.951
Yes. lt is. How are you?

12:56.160 --> 13:00.831
Dr. Elaine Burns. We met in Hawaii
almost 1 8 years ago.

13:02.583 --> 13:06.379
The conference on identifying
POW remains in Vietnam?

13:06.629 --> 13:10.049
Yes, of course.
How wonderful to see you again.

13:10.257 --> 13:13.594
l still have that puka-shell necklace
you gave me.

13:13.844 --> 13:18.641
Yes, quite the keepsake,
aren't they?

13:18.891 --> 13:21.102
Do you have information
on how this man died?

13:21.310 --> 13:24.146
Yes. We took the liberty
of imaging the corpse

13:24.313 --> 13:26.816
before we knew for sure we were
dealing with an actual homicide

13:27.024 --> 13:29.527
- and not just some sick hoax.
- You disturbed my crime scene?

13:30.236 --> 13:32.988
As a forensic anthropologist,
l can assure you

13:33.197 --> 13:36.409
my examination
was strictly non-invasive.

13:37.159 --> 13:39.995
There. Now, l've seen several images
like this in the past,

13:40.204 --> 13:41.997
but you can't be certain
until you get it out.

13:42.248 --> 13:44.834
- Get what out?
- ln my opinion,

13:45.042 --> 13:46.752
it's a musket ball.

13:57.179 --> 13:59.014
l don't think this is what Gibbs
had in mind

13:59.265 --> 14:00.725
when he instructed me to observe.

14:00.933 --> 14:02.935
Do you have any idea
how many people get killed

14:03.185 --> 14:04.895
in America by bears every year,
Ziva?

14:06.147 --> 14:08.274
No, but l can't imagine a lot.

14:08.691 --> 14:10.401
You'd be surprised.

14:10.735 --> 14:12.194
McGee?

14:12.403 --> 14:14.739
l think it's about one.

14:16.073 --> 14:18.117
lsn't there something constructive
you could be doing?

14:18.659 --> 14:20.745
- Like what?
- lnvestigating.

14:21.662 --> 14:23.456
DiNozzo and McGee. Report in.

14:24.165 --> 14:25.875
Casket was uncovered
by a housing project

14:26.125 --> 14:28.419
going up near the Bull Run Battlefield
in Manassas, boss.

14:28.669 --> 14:30.337
Got the name and address
of the company.

14:30.588 --> 14:32.548
Scheduled an interview
and soil test for tomorrow.

14:32.757 --> 14:34.800
The only thing removed
from the casket was a cell phone,

14:35.009 --> 14:38.095
damaged and non-operational. l've also
got the prints of the lab workers

14:38.262 --> 14:40.723
to run against any we find
in or around the body and tomb.

14:40.931 --> 14:43.476
Dr. Burns was wearing surgical gloves
when she picked this up.

14:43.684 --> 14:45.478
Good work. Ms. David?

14:46.520 --> 14:51.150
l'm wondering why there's
a nine-millimetre hole in my hat.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.402
Ventilation.

14:53.778 --> 14:56.697
l'll escort the casket back with Ducky.
We'll meet in the squad room.

14:56.864 --> 14:58.532
Agent Gibbs?

14:58.783 --> 15:02.745
l would also like to know
if l could drive the truck back to base.

15:02.995 --> 15:08.501
lt might make me feel as if l actually
accomplished something today.

15:09.668 --> 15:12.588
- Hey, not so fast.
- l always drive fast.

15:12.838 --> 15:15.925
lt's the best way to avoid
possible lEDs and ambushes.

15:16.675 --> 15:19.053
You're in America now.
l wouldn't worry about it.

15:21.097 --> 15:23.682
How about this?
Slow down or l'll puke on you.

15:24.016 --> 15:26.936
Tony, why don't you like
the American Civil War?

15:27.186 --> 15:29.939
- l don't want to talk about it.
- lt's because of his father.

15:30.815 --> 15:32.566
Was she talking to you, probie?

15:32.817 --> 15:37.238
Oh, you didn't get along
with your father. Explains a lot.

15:37.446 --> 15:40.866
- My father and l got along fine.
- lf you say so.

15:41.075 --> 15:44.161
l think it's best to talk about things
instead of burying them inside.

15:44.412 --> 15:49.166
What about you? Your father?
Deputy Director David, what's he like?

15:51.252 --> 15:54.171
Slow down.
We're taking the next left.

15:58.801 --> 16:01.095
Ziva, car! Car! Car!

16:06.183 --> 16:07.643
Ziva!

16:08.310 --> 16:09.687
Sorry.

16:09.895 --> 16:13.274
First time behind the wheel
after a six-month mission in the U.K.

16:15.776 --> 16:17.987
l said l was sorry.

16:19.947 --> 16:21.198
We ran his prints through AFlS.

16:21.449 --> 16:25.161
lt is confirmed our Union soldier
is Staff Sergeant Warren Sorrow,

16:25.369 --> 16:26.662
an MSG instructor in Quantico.

16:26.871 --> 16:29.790
- MSG stands for--
- Marine Security Guard.

16:29.957 --> 16:32.793
l've been to over two dozen embassies
around the world, Tony.

16:32.960 --> 16:35.963
- What do we have on the sergeant?
- Reported UA about a year ago.

16:36.172 --> 16:38.049
l'm currently building
a profile on his life

16:38.257 --> 16:39.633
around the time
of his disappearance.

16:39.842 --> 16:41.218
Not anymore. l want you with Abby.

16:41.469 --> 16:43.637
Find out what was on the cell phone
we found in the casket.

16:43.846 --> 16:46.599
You're on the paper trail.
l wanna know everything about him.

16:46.807 --> 16:49.268
And you. You keep--

16:49.518 --> 16:51.437
You keep observing.

16:51.645 --> 16:53.022
What exactly, Gibbs?

16:53.939 --> 16:57.693
l don't care. Just do it quietly.

17:01.989 --> 17:04.909
Now l know why he took
all my weapons away.

17:07.494 --> 17:09.579
Have you ever spent an evening
with a young lady

17:09.829 --> 17:13.375
and failed to remember it,
Mr. Palmer?

17:13.626 --> 17:15.419
Oh, what was l thinking?
Of course not.

17:15.836 --> 17:17.296
But l wouldn't mind.

17:17.505 --> 17:20.257
Well, it's not something
to be admired, Mr. Palmer.

17:20.549 --> 17:23.719
That doctor today
at the Smithsonian

17:23.969 --> 17:27.890
intimated that we shared
a special something in Hawaii

17:28.140 --> 17:31.602
- during a conference once.
- Yeah, what doctor was that, doctor?

17:31.852 --> 17:34.063
The young and attractive one.

17:34.313 --> 17:36.023
Still not following you.

17:36.232 --> 17:39.151
She was the only doctor there
beside myself.

17:39.402 --> 17:41.695
- Oh, you mean Dr. Burns?
- Yeah.

17:41.904 --> 17:44.448
Oh, l'm sorry. l thought that you said
she was young.

17:44.865 --> 17:46.909
Young to me, Mr. Palmer.

17:47.701 --> 17:49.662
Young to me.

17:52.331 --> 17:56.377
Will you rotate the head 20 degrees
to the left?

17:57.712 --> 18:01.090
She invited me out for cocktails
tomorrow evening.

18:01.340 --> 18:04.427
- l was forced to decline.
- Why? She seemed nice.

18:04.635 --> 18:07.012
Oh, she's more than nice.

18:07.221 --> 18:09.223
But how do you tell a woman
that you have absolutely

18:09.473 --> 18:12.560
no mental recollection of her
whatsoever?

18:12.768 --> 18:14.228
l suppose one could always lie.

18:15.855 --> 18:18.983
Have you been spending time
with Agent DiNozzo again?

18:26.240 --> 18:28.993
- To Abby, please.
- Right away, doctor.

18:31.620 --> 18:34.707
l don't suppose
you've ever been to Hawaii.

18:37.001 --> 18:38.544
That should do it.

18:39.545 --> 18:41.922
That's what you said
the last eight times.

18:42.173 --> 18:44.925
See, that shows how much attention
you pay to me.

18:45.092 --> 18:49.013
- lt was nine, Timmy.
- Right.

18:49.638 --> 18:51.474
So did we do it? Did we do it?
Did we do it?

18:51.682 --> 18:54.226
Did we fix the cell phone's
circuit board?

18:54.435 --> 18:56.896
- Hold on.
- Come on.

18:57.354 --> 18:58.731
You're killing me, McGee.

19:00.232 --> 19:03.110
Yes. Yes, l think that we fixed it.

19:03.360 --> 19:05.154
l think the circuits are--

19:08.324 --> 19:10.451
How many Caf-Pow!s
you had today, Abby?

19:10.701 --> 19:13.120
You know, the usual.

19:14.080 --> 19:15.790
Trust me, you've had more
than the usual.

19:15.998 --> 19:17.833
Because l'm getting jumpy
just looking at you.

19:18.084 --> 19:22.838
Some people drown their sorrows
in drugs and alcohol. l prefer caffeine.

19:23.089 --> 19:25.466
Now hook up the cell phone board
and get cracking

19:25.716 --> 19:27.927
before Gibbs
decides to crack you one.

19:28.177 --> 19:32.640
- You mean crack us.
- Gibbs would never hit a lady.

19:32.848 --> 19:36.185
Exactly. So l suggest we get started.

19:46.028 --> 19:48.114
- Ziva?
- Yes?

19:50.658 --> 19:52.493
First of all, don't ever do that again.

19:53.285 --> 19:55.663
And second, what are you doing?

19:55.913 --> 19:58.040
l'm observing you, Tony.

19:58.290 --> 20:00.668
Any way you can do that
in a less creepy manner?

20:05.339 --> 20:07.466
Who's the woman with Gibbs?

20:07.675 --> 20:09.677
Once you're here long enough,
you'll figure it out.

20:09.927 --> 20:12.054
- ls that his girlfriend?
- l have no idea.

20:12.304 --> 20:14.515
- You just told me that--
- Well--

20:14.765 --> 20:18.352
You'll figure out there's some things
around here you don't ask about.

20:21.439 --> 20:23.399
All right, then.

20:27.027 --> 20:28.738
Bye.

20:28.946 --> 20:30.990
- Where's Gibbs, Tony?
- Your 2 o'clock.

20:31.449 --> 20:33.159
What's wrong, Duck?

20:33.367 --> 20:36.370
l know how our staff sergeant died.

20:36.579 --> 20:40.207
From your look l'm guessing
it wasn't a musket ball.

20:40.416 --> 20:44.295
At first one could assume
that a projectile of such size and mass

20:44.545 --> 20:46.714
would produce almost instant death,

20:47.298 --> 20:51.510
but pre-Civil War muskets
were notoriously unreliable

20:51.719 --> 20:55.222
and lost most of their velocity
over the first hundred metres.

20:55.639 --> 20:59.769
Our sergeant was grievously wounded
by a musket ball,

20:59.977 --> 21:02.980
but his injury was not fatal.

21:03.230 --> 21:05.608
Then how did he die, Dr. Mallard?

21:05.816 --> 21:09.695
His lung tissue was coated
with an extremely fine film

21:09.904 --> 21:12.573
of rust particles.

21:12.740 --> 21:15.159
And one can only imagine
how long he clawed

21:15.367 --> 21:17.953
at the iron sides of his casket,

21:18.871 --> 21:23.793
trying to escape
before he suffocated.

21:33.327 --> 21:37.581
A Marine dressed as a Civil War
soldier is shot by a musket

21:37.831 --> 21:42.461
and then buried alive
in a 1 40-year-old antique iron casket.

21:43.128 --> 21:47.591
And you're telling me
this isn't your strangest case?

21:47.800 --> 21:50.636
- Yep.
- Pretty much.

21:50.844 --> 21:52.387
l don't know what
l find more disturbing.

21:52.554 --> 21:54.556
Your eating habits
or the fact that l believe you.

21:54.765 --> 21:59.478
l'm sorry, do our strange
American foods frighten you?

21:59.728 --> 22:03.440
Not at all.
l was referring to your manners.

22:03.649 --> 22:05.442
You should have bought me one.

22:11.115 --> 22:12.950
l'm gonna go help Abby.

22:15.828 --> 22:17.371
She seems to be fitting in well.

22:19.665 --> 22:21.834
She almost killed
my entire team yesterday.

22:22.084 --> 22:24.837
- How?
- Driving home from a crime scene.

22:25.087 --> 22:28.465
l should've warned you. l think
she was an East European cabdriver

22:28.674 --> 22:30.676
- in a past life.
- Yeah, well, she wasn't a cop.

22:31.260 --> 22:35.472
She obviously has no investigative
or law-enforcement experience, Jen.

22:35.681 --> 22:37.141
Neither did l when l first started.

22:37.349 --> 22:40.227
Yeah, well, you were always
a fast learner.

22:50.195 --> 22:51.989
You sure you don't want it back,
Tony?

22:52.197 --> 22:56.160
Most men usually don't have a problem
with my germs.

22:57.744 --> 23:00.330
l've got a lead on
how our staff sergeant ended up

23:00.539 --> 23:02.708
in a Union soldier's uniform.

23:04.877 --> 23:07.463
He was a member of a local C.W.--

23:07.921 --> 23:10.591
C.W.R out of Fairfax.

23:10.883 --> 23:13.051
C.W.R.?

23:13.427 --> 23:17.473
Yeah. Civil War Re-enactors.
Guys who get together,

23:17.681 --> 23:20.684
dress up in period costumes,
re-enacting famous battles.

23:20.851 --> 23:22.060
Why?

23:22.269 --> 23:24.688
l've been asking my father that
since l was 1 0 years old.

23:24.897 --> 23:29.193
They're preparing for one of those
battles this week in Manassas.

23:29.401 --> 23:31.737
Quite the coincidence.

23:32.654 --> 23:35.699
And in the immortal words
of Leroy Jethro Gibbs,

23:35.908 --> 23:38.243
- l don't believe in coincidences.
- ls that a fact?

23:38.535 --> 23:40.579
l was just telling Ziva
about this lead that l--

23:40.829 --> 23:42.539
Yeah, l heard.

23:43.081 --> 23:45.417
Come on. Abby's found something.
Let's roll.

23:45.667 --> 23:49.004
That's an American custom.
A form of affection.

23:49.296 --> 23:52.049
<i>lt seems like Shalowsh Stooges
to me.</i>

23:52.591 --> 23:54.134
Like what?

23:56.637 --> 23:59.097
Larry, Moe, Curly, yes?

24:09.274 --> 24:12.820
- Abs?
- l look like a freak.

24:16.740 --> 24:19.409
Well?

24:19.618 --> 24:21.662
See, l don't think
she really looks that bad.

24:21.870 --> 24:25.499
ls she making a reference
to that strange tattoo on her neck?

24:26.792 --> 24:27.835
Why?

24:30.796 --> 24:35.175
One of the director's new admin
weenies brought me this last night.

24:35.717 --> 24:38.846
lt's the NClS dress code.
He said l was in violation.

24:39.054 --> 24:40.305
He did, didn't he?

24:40.514 --> 24:42.850
lt's bad enough
that l have to wear a monkey suit

24:43.058 --> 24:45.185
for court appearances,
but every day?

24:45.394 --> 24:47.896
l think you look nice, Abby.

24:49.439 --> 24:54.611
Nice? You think l look nice?
l look like-- Like--

24:54.820 --> 24:57.364
Career Girl Barbie.

24:58.407 --> 25:00.534
Oh, my God.

25:01.410 --> 25:03.287
l do.

25:03.912 --> 25:06.457
- l can't work like this, Gibbs.
- l'll take care of it, Abs.

25:06.665 --> 25:09.001
l'm allergic to polyester.
lt makes me itch.

25:09.209 --> 25:11.670
lt's a medical condition.
l could get a note from the doctor.

25:11.879 --> 25:15.466
Abby, l said l'll take care of it.

25:18.552 --> 25:21.221
- Don't ask.
- Can we get back to work now?

25:21.805 --> 25:23.390
Do l have to wear the shoes?

25:27.478 --> 25:29.813
The circuit board on the cell phone
was damaged.

25:30.105 --> 25:32.024
But we managed to get it
working again.

25:32.816 --> 25:35.569
The battery shut down
on October 3rd, 2004.

25:35.778 --> 25:39.031
- The last 22 calls were made to 91 1 .
- None of them went through.

25:39.239 --> 25:41.492
He was calling
from inside the casket.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.536
Yep. Cast iron
and buried underground.

25:44.745 --> 25:46.914
l don't think anyone's calling plan
extends that far.

25:47.122 --> 25:48.749
What are the last entries here?

25:48.916 --> 25:51.043
Well, he was running low
on oxygen, Boss.

25:51.251 --> 25:54.087
l assume he was trying to dial
another number and hit random keys.

25:54.296 --> 25:55.672
Find out.

25:55.881 --> 25:57.508
What did you pull from the tomb,
Abs?

25:57.716 --> 26:01.178
There were traces of Staff Sergeant
Sorrow's blood inside the cover.

26:01.428 --> 26:04.014
Most likely from when he tried
to claw his way out.

26:04.223 --> 26:07.684
Since his fingers were shredded,
that must've been hard to figure out.

26:07.893 --> 26:09.895
Agent David.

26:12.189 --> 26:14.024
lt's pronounced David.

26:14.441 --> 26:16.276
Or you can just call me Ziva.

26:16.777 --> 26:19.905
l also found two very distinct types
of dirt on the outside.

26:20.280 --> 26:22.950
One is red clay,
which is very common in Virginia.

26:23.200 --> 26:26.036
And the other had a high concentration
of fertilizer.

26:26.245 --> 26:28.122
Time you meet with the company
that found this?

26:28.330 --> 26:29.873
- 0900.
- Take Ziva with you.

26:30.082 --> 26:31.917
See if anything's left
of that crime scene.

26:32.126 --> 26:33.669
l'm on it.

26:40.175 --> 26:41.802
Come on, McGee.

26:59.611 --> 27:02.448
Abby, what if these aren't numbers?

27:05.826 --> 27:07.286
Abby?

27:26.472 --> 27:30.601
- See something you like, McGee?
- No.

27:30.809 --> 27:32.603
l mean, yes?

27:32.853 --> 27:36.106
Better.
What were you gonna tell me?

27:38.025 --> 27:40.486
What if he wasn't trying
to dial a number

27:40.778 --> 27:44.323
but he was trying
to send a text message?

27:47.326 --> 27:51.121
McGee, sometimes l think
l love you.

27:52.080 --> 27:53.957
Tell me you have a shower here.

27:54.166 --> 27:57.503
We do. But only for biological
or chemical emergencies.

27:57.711 --> 28:00.547
- Wonderful.
- You said you were sick of observing.

28:00.714 --> 28:02.841
You made me crawl
through a dump truck full of dirt.

28:03.050 --> 28:04.426
There could've been
valuable evidence.

28:04.593 --> 28:05.719
There wasn't.

28:05.928 --> 28:08.180
Yes, and thanks to you,
we now know that.

28:09.097 --> 28:12.392
- How'd it go?
- Nothing, boss.

28:12.643 --> 28:14.186
Building site was clean.

28:14.436 --> 28:17.356
- Figuratively speaking.
- Very.

28:17.564 --> 28:20.484
We taped off the area,
but we're not gonna find anything.

28:21.026 --> 28:22.111
Gibbs.

28:23.028 --> 28:24.488
- We did it.
- Did what, Abs?

28:24.696 --> 28:26.949
Those random numbers
weren't random after all, boss.

28:27.241 --> 28:32.371
Staff Sergeant Sorrow was leaving us
a text message from the grave.

28:34.081 --> 28:37.209
When you put it through the cell
phone's text converter, you get this.

28:40.295 --> 28:43.048
''Only got half.
Oxbow not on his side.

28:43.215 --> 28:45.676
Kearns, don't let him
get safety-deposit box.''

28:45.884 --> 28:48.137
- That's it?
- He was buried alive, Tony.

28:48.345 --> 28:50.222
What did you expect, a soliloquy?

28:50.472 --> 28:52.307
We ran his social through
the banking system.

28:52.558 --> 28:54.935
Staff Sergeant Sorrow
has a safety-deposit box

28:55.185 --> 28:57.938
paid for five years at
the North Virginia Savings and Trust.

28:58.105 --> 28:59.773
- Get me a--
- Warrant. l already called it in.

28:59.982 --> 29:01.775
- DiNozzo, Oxbow and Kearns?
- On it.

29:01.942 --> 29:05.279
Get me into that safety-deposit box.
You take Ziva with you.

29:05.487 --> 29:08.365
ls there somewhere l can clean up?

29:08.574 --> 29:12.619
Yeah. Sure.
Tonight when you go home.

29:21.044 --> 29:22.796
You know what?
Let me help you with that.

29:23.005 --> 29:24.798
l'm not a child.

29:25.007 --> 29:26.842
Just trying to help.

29:27.426 --> 29:29.636
You may get what l missed.

29:30.554 --> 29:32.139
Thank you.

29:32.931 --> 29:36.560
- ls Tony always so--?
- Yeah.

29:36.852 --> 29:39.605
- And Gibbs?
- Oh, yeah.

29:39.855 --> 29:41.815
And Abby?

29:42.024 --> 29:44.276
Abby's usually nice.

29:45.194 --> 29:48.739
Then it's me.
l guess l have that effect on people.

29:48.947 --> 29:51.325
lt's-- lt's not you, Ziva.

29:51.533 --> 29:54.453
The past month
has been hard on everyone.

29:54.661 --> 29:56.205
But l'm glad you're here.

29:56.371 --> 29:57.498
Yes?

29:57.706 --> 29:59.875
Yeah. Means l'm not
the newbie anymore.

30:10.469 --> 30:12.012
What's wrong?

30:12.221 --> 30:14.097
Nothing.

30:14.306 --> 30:16.767
Still getting used to America,
l suppose.

30:25.567 --> 30:29.029
l understand Staff Sergeant Sorrows
has been missing.

30:29.238 --> 30:31.198
- Who told you that?
- His brother.

30:31.406 --> 30:33.700
He's enquired several times
about the safety-deposit box.

30:33.909 --> 30:35.786
- Why?
- He felt if something had happened,

30:35.994 --> 30:39.206
- he would've wanted him to have it.
- Like death?

30:39.414 --> 30:41.750
Obviously. But without
a death certificate and a court order,

30:41.959 --> 30:45.379
our policy is to maintain the contents
until the lease runs out.

30:45.587 --> 30:48.507
- ls Staff Sergeant Sorrows missing?
- Not anymore.

30:49.383 --> 30:52.719
Anything else
or can we open the box now?

30:52.928 --> 30:55.097
l'll be outside if you need me.

31:05.941 --> 31:09.069
- We need to talk to his brother.
- Definitely.

31:19.913 --> 31:22.832
A mummified hand.
An ancient map.

31:22.999 --> 31:25.210
This has to be
your strangest case now, McGee.

31:25.418 --> 31:28.087
Thanks. Maybe. That was Tony.

31:28.379 --> 31:30.757
Staff Sergeant Sorrow does not
have a brother.

31:30.965 --> 31:33.384
So we need to pull the bank
security-camera footage,

31:33.593 --> 31:36.596
see if they have a shot of this guy
who claims to be his brother.

31:36.763 --> 31:38.223
You know what this reminds me of?

31:38.431 --> 31:40.558
- Mossad case?
- No.

31:40.808 --> 31:44.938
- A Harry Potter novel.
- You read those too?

31:47.607 --> 31:48.816
Me neither.

31:52.779 --> 31:55.281
Excuse me. Excuse me.

31:55.490 --> 31:58.034
Do you know where l can find
a Kelleher Avenue?

31:58.284 --> 31:59.869
Yeah.
North of here about four blocks.

32:00.078 --> 32:01.454
- Four blocks? Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:01.621 --> 32:03.915
Hey, l'm gonna need
that map too.

32:04.123 --> 32:06.292
- Excuse me?
- The map.

32:06.501 --> 32:08.920
Why don't you take a look
at that van behind me?

32:16.803 --> 32:20.723
All right, now give me your weapon.
Come on, give it to me.

32:25.478 --> 32:28.606
Now back up. Back up.

32:32.652 --> 32:35.196
- Now what?
- Now you get wet.

32:46.499 --> 32:47.792
Damn it.

32:52.380 --> 32:56.509
- Gibbs is gonna kill me.
- Look on the bright side, McGee.

32:57.969 --> 32:59.762
At least l'm clean again.

33:02.181 --> 33:05.018
No, no, no. Tighter.
Hold it tighter, Mr. Palmer.

33:05.184 --> 33:07.020
l'm gonna put some English on it.

33:12.817 --> 33:15.320
- Oh, dear.
- A little too much English, doctor.

33:15.528 --> 33:18.364
There is no such thing.

33:18.781 --> 33:21.618
Do you know what we have here,
Mr. Palmer?

33:21.784 --> 33:24.704
- A very old ring?
- Yes.

33:24.871 --> 33:27.540
And a reason to call
Dr. Burns back.

33:29.542 --> 33:32.921
Boss, l'm sorry. l screwed up
and it won't happen again.

33:33.129 --> 33:35.673
lt wasn't your fault. They used us.

33:36.090 --> 33:39.010
Used us to get into
that safety-deposit box for them.

33:39.219 --> 33:41.804
He knew exactly what he wanted.
All he asked for was the map.

33:42.055 --> 33:45.183
Map? What map?
Map of what, McGee?

33:45.725 --> 33:50.021
- l didn't really get a good look at it.
- Maybe it was a treasure map, probie.

33:50.230 --> 33:53.316
You know, like gold,
diamonds, silver.

33:53.525 --> 33:55.568
lt wasn't from one
of your dumb-ass movies, DiNozzo.

33:55.818 --> 33:58.029
- Sorry.
- We need to find this guy.

33:58.238 --> 34:00.198
Claimed he was
Staff Sergeant Sorrow's brother.

34:00.406 --> 34:01.783
l might have a name for him.

34:01.950 --> 34:04.911
Been researching the words
from Sorrow's farewell message.

34:05.119 --> 34:08.039
- Oxbow and Kearns.
- Oxbow is the name on the map.

34:08.873 --> 34:10.667
The other name might be his.

34:10.833 --> 34:13.585
Judd Kearns,
a member of the same Civil War club

34:13.753 --> 34:16.047
- our dead staff sergeant belonged to.
- Get an address?

34:16.255 --> 34:18.091
Yeah, but he's not there.

34:18.757 --> 34:21.219
The club is on their way
to Manassas Battlefield Park

34:21.427 --> 34:23.596
for a re-enactment.
Should be there this afternoon.

34:23.846 --> 34:26.431
McGee, what else do you remember
about the map?

34:26.641 --> 34:28.518
l think l can help with that.

34:30.937 --> 34:36.109
At Mossad, officers who fail
to observe don't generally last long.

34:36.609 --> 34:41.239
And at NClS, they apparently get
drop-kicked into water fountains.

34:41.489 --> 34:43.908
That would have never happened
if l had my weapons.

34:44.117 --> 34:45.577
Find out what this is a map of.

34:45.784 --> 34:46.995
l'm gonna get right on it.

34:57.463 --> 35:02.051
Abby, Ziva was amazing. l mean,
she's got a photographic memory.

35:03.970 --> 35:05.638
What?

35:06.598 --> 35:09.559
Why don't you two
just get a room, McGee?

35:11.019 --> 35:12.937
What, you think she likes me?

35:13.146 --> 35:16.441
McGee, never forget.

35:16.649 --> 35:21.154
l am one of the few people
in the world who can murder you

35:21.404 --> 35:24.490
and leave no forensic evidence.

35:24.657 --> 35:26.534
Well, perhaps
we should come back then.

35:26.743 --> 35:29.954
Ducky. Just venting.
Who's your friend?

35:30.163 --> 35:32.999
l'd like you to meet
Dr. Elaine Burns,

35:33.166 --> 35:36.336
a forensic anthropologist
from the Smithsonian.

35:36.544 --> 35:40.840
Ducky was saying
you might be in need of my expertise.

35:41.799 --> 35:43.635
lt's French, 1 9th century.

35:44.010 --> 35:48.306
Usually worn by Southern gentlemen
to telegraph wealth and status.

35:48.556 --> 35:51.309
lt's in fantastic condition.
Where did you find it?

35:51.517 --> 35:55.813
On a mummified hand
in a safety-deposit box, l'm afraid.

35:56.022 --> 35:58.775
Sounds like scavengers.
Grave robbers.

35:58.983 --> 36:01.444
We've had more sites ruined
by them than l care to remember.

36:01.653 --> 36:04.113
How about the map
we found with it, Abs?

36:09.369 --> 36:11.788
Certainly typical
of the Civil War period.

36:11.996 --> 36:14.999
lCF stands
for lrregular Confederate Forces.

36:15.208 --> 36:18.211
Oxbow may be referring
to a prominent Virginia family.

36:18.378 --> 36:20.338
Where did they live?

36:20.547 --> 36:22.674
Manassas.
Their mansion was destroyed

36:22.882 --> 36:25.260
in the Second Battle of Bull Run
by the Union.

36:25.468 --> 36:28.012
Remember how we found
Boone's dumping ground, Gibbs?

36:28.221 --> 36:32.684
l could run the vectors between
these features and satellite imagery.

36:32.892 --> 36:34.853
- Do it.
- Well, if it is Manassas,

36:35.061 --> 36:38.064
l've had several digs there. l'd be
more than willing to serve as a guide.

36:38.857 --> 36:44.612
That is, if Dr. Mallard
would be willing to accompany me.

36:46.155 --> 36:48.157
Boss, his club checked in
with the park rangers.

36:48.366 --> 36:50.076
Judd Kearns is there now.
Are we rolling?

36:50.243 --> 36:53.079
No, not yet.

36:55.081 --> 36:56.833
Gear up.

37:18.605 --> 37:21.983
- Bring back memories for you, Tony?
- lt looks like fun.

37:22.442 --> 37:24.277
You know what
little Anthony DiNozzo's job was

37:24.569 --> 37:25.862
during these re-enactments, Ziva?

37:26.070 --> 37:28.072
- Little drummer boy?
- No.

37:28.448 --> 37:31.201
l would carry around a bucket
so these guys could take a dump in it.

37:31.367 --> 37:33.494
They called me their ''little poo boy.''

37:34.954 --> 37:37.790
Kearns is out here somewhere
dressed as a Union sergeant.

37:38.333 --> 37:39.584
You two with me.

37:39.792 --> 37:42.795
See if you can match up
any of the landmarks on the map.

37:44.547 --> 37:47.300
Any suggestions, doctors?

37:47.550 --> 37:49.719
Let me look.

37:51.554 --> 37:53.765
By the orientation of the map,
l suggest we start

37:53.973 --> 37:56.434
near some of my old dig sites
to the north.

37:56.643 --> 37:58.394
Unless... May l?

37:58.603 --> 38:02.273
During times of war,
mapmakers often add terrain

38:02.482 --> 38:05.568
or change the declination of north
and south in order to confuse--

38:05.818 --> 38:08.279
Confuse the enemy
before it fell into the wrong hands.

38:08.488 --> 38:10.114
Yeah, very good, Ziva.

38:10.323 --> 38:14.285
Yes, what troubles me about this map
is this Confederate flag in the corner.

38:14.494 --> 38:18.122
lt's unfurled in the opposite direction
of most flags.

38:18.331 --> 38:20.166
Precisely.

38:20.833 --> 38:24.587
l think we should start
looking to the south.

38:34.514 --> 38:38.101
Boss, your 3 o'clock. Red stripes.

38:39.018 --> 38:41.104
That's the guy from the bank video.

38:42.856 --> 38:44.399
Oh, he's going.

38:45.859 --> 38:48.611
- Fast.
- You think?

38:49.821 --> 38:50.822
Son of a--

38:51.030 --> 38:53.449
Ziva, l really think
we should wait for Gibbs.

38:53.658 --> 38:56.536
He is the one that told us
to look for landmarks, Dr. Mallard.

38:56.744 --> 39:00.164
Landmarks, yes. Following them
deep into the woods, probably not.

39:01.541 --> 39:05.879
- And please, call me Ducky.
- Okay, Ducky.

39:06.129 --> 39:10.174
l believe this is the trail
indicated on the map.

39:10.383 --> 39:13.469
l doubt it. Wait. The topography's
completely different today.

39:13.678 --> 39:15.513
We might have better luck
near the site

39:15.722 --> 39:17.682
where the Oxbow mansion
used to stand.

39:17.891 --> 39:20.101
We can try that next.

39:23.521 --> 39:24.689
That's not bad, boss.

39:24.898 --> 39:27.734
l thought you were still behind me
until you tackled him.

39:27.901 --> 39:30.570
Not likely, DiNozzo.

39:31.237 --> 39:32.906
What's his excuse?

39:39.078 --> 39:41.122
lt wasn't an X on the map.

39:42.749 --> 39:46.544
lt's a cross. This is a graveyard.

39:49.964 --> 39:52.842
Ducky, wait here and call Gibbs.

39:53.051 --> 39:54.761
Tell him to hurry.

40:10.944 --> 40:12.737
We need to hurry this up.

40:15.406 --> 40:16.783
Yeah, that's it.

40:26.417 --> 40:29.462
They buried these things
so the South could rise again,

40:29.671 --> 40:31.464
and now they are all mine.

40:31.923 --> 40:33.967
There's gotta be 50 of them here.

40:34.717 --> 40:39.138
- At 30 grand a pop, that's--
- One point five million.

40:39.347 --> 40:41.266
Your rifle is ten feet away.

40:41.808 --> 40:43.726
l wouldn't recommend trying it.

40:43.935 --> 40:45.103
l didn't do anything wrong.

40:45.645 --> 40:47.272
No? What about resisting arrest,
Kearns?

40:47.480 --> 40:48.940
And what's that other charge,
McGee?

40:49.148 --> 40:51.025
Murdering Staff Sergeant
Warren Sorrow.

40:51.818 --> 40:54.028
Sorrow's dead? No way.

40:54.237 --> 40:56.030
You guys can't pin that on me.
l wouldn't.

40:56.239 --> 40:58.825
They told me
he got scared and took off.

40:59.033 --> 41:02.620
He was buried alive
in a coffin, dirtbag.

41:03.830 --> 41:05.790
l didn't sign up for this.

41:06.291 --> 41:08.293
All she said
l had to do was distract you.

41:08.501 --> 41:10.545
DiNozzo, come on.

41:12.130 --> 41:13.840
Ducky.

41:14.007 --> 41:15.633
Ducky, where is Gibbs?

41:17.260 --> 41:20.096
Ducky can't answer right now.

41:21.055 --> 41:22.515
Drop the gun.

41:22.682 --> 41:23.808
Now. Or he dies.

41:24.851 --> 41:28.479
l knew there was a reason
l blocked you out of my mind.

41:29.898 --> 41:32.233
Last time l ask. Drop it.

41:32.483 --> 41:34.986
Shoot her, Ziva.
She'll only kill both of us.

41:39.657 --> 41:41.618
And those weapons?

41:41.868 --> 41:44.787
That is why you killed
that poor staff sergeant?

41:44.996 --> 41:47.373
He found Oxbow's casket
and the map.

41:47.582 --> 41:50.251
He actually wanted to turn them over
to a museum.

41:50.418 --> 41:53.379
The only mistake we made
was killing him before we got the map.

41:53.588 --> 41:57.717
You two are going to be
the unfortunate victims of scavengers.

42:16.236 --> 42:18.530
Remind me not to piss her off.

42:18.738 --> 42:22.408
Oh, DiNozzo, you have no idea.

42:37.340 --> 42:39.509
She's gone, Gibbs.

42:40.426 --> 42:42.220
l don't think Kate would mind.

42:51.771 --> 42:55.066
l found this, but l have a feeling

42:56.276 --> 42:58.862
she would've wanted you
to have it.

43:04.075 --> 43:06.077
See you in the morning.
