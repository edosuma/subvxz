Boys, I think it's time to upgrade
our position in the lunchroom.

11:02.148 --> 11:03.817
But we just got our table back.

11:03.850 --> 11:05.853
Yeah, but we're witches now.

11:05.885 --> 11:08.222
We shouldn't be sitting at the
worst table in the cafet...

11:08.255 --> 11:09.689
Worst table?!

It's right by the garbage
and the bathrooms!

11:12.558 --> 11:15.127
What is wrong with you?

11:15.160 --> 11:15.896

Marshall, my good man.
How's your day going?

11:18.765 --> 11:20.634
Can I hook you guys up
with some butterflies?

Dude, you have 10 seconds to get

11:23.669 --> 11:26.707

You know the old saying...

11:31.111 --> 11:32.940

There aren't enough
butterflies in the world

11:36.529 --> 11:38.385
to make you cool enough to sit with us.

11:38.418 --> 11:42.656
In fact, there's fewer and fewer
butterflies every year, nerd!

11:42.688 --> 11:44.857

11:44.890 --> 11:47.159
Embarrass me in front of everyone.

11:47.193 --> 11:50.029
He'll pay for this. Stupid Marshall.

11:50.063 --> 11:52.832
He's not stupid, Steve.

11:52.866 --> 11:54.835
He's the Federation
of Christian Athletes'

11:54.867 --> 11:57.103
Scholar Baller of the Month.

11:57.136 --> 11:59.705
Don't you listen to the announcements?

11:59.739 --> 12:03.243
Hello, pod listeners.
This is our brand-new podcast

12:03.275 --> 12:05.444
where we remember bands from the '90s.

12:05.477 --> 12:07.347
That's right...
Billy C. was in the White House,

12:07.380 --> 12:10.449
Frasier packed up his stuff
and moved from Beantown to Seattle,

12:10.482 --> 12:13.219
and no one could escape
the sounds of bands like...

12:13.252 --> 12:15.254
- Better Than Ezra.
- Cowboy Junkies.

12:15.288 --> 12:17.356
- Spin Doctors.
- Toad the Wet Sprocket.

12:17.390 --> 12:18.617
- Hey, Stan?
- Yeah, Klaus?

12:18.617 --> 12:20.928
Who would you say is
your favorite '90s band

12:20.961 --> 12:23.764
to remember with the word
"soul" in their name?

12:23.797 --> 12:26.266
Asylum, Coughing, or Collective?

12:26.299 --> 12:28.702
Easy, Collective. Collective Soul.

12:28.735 --> 12:32.239
I love remembering Collective Soul.

12:34.441 --> 12:36.576
(twinkles)

12:36.608 --> 12:38.210
What's up, my witches?

12:38.244 --> 12:39.646
What happened to your hair?

12:39.678 --> 12:42.082
- And why are you with him?
- Oh, Marshall?

12:42.115 --> 12:44.217
He decided to quit football
and become a boy witch.

12:44.250 --> 12:47.453
I realized I wanted to be a cool witch,

12:47.486 --> 12:49.121
like Steve, my master.

12:49.154 --> 12:50.624
See? Nothing weird.

12:50.656 --> 12:53.793
When did Marshall's eyes
get milky, like a blind guy?

12:53.827 --> 12:56.296
You used Blood Magic on him!

12:56.328 --> 12:58.332
You broke our hold-hand promise!

12:58.365 --> 12:59.306
What's wrong with you?!

12:59.306 --> 13:02.836
Marshall disrespected us,
and I taught him some respect.

13:02.869 --> 13:04.303
We should be running this school.

13:04.337 --> 13:06.065
We should be running this whole town.

13:06.065 --> 13:07.940
You're out of control, Steve.

13:07.973 --> 13:11.110
We only got into this so
we'd have a place to eat.

13:11.144 --> 13:12.479
Place to eat?!

13:12.511 --> 13:14.080
We should be able to
eat wherever we want

13:14.114 --> 13:15.682
and however we want.

13:15.715 --> 13:17.284
Marshall, churro!

13:17.317 --> 13:20.587
(munching)

13:20.620 --> 13:22.022
Ahh.

13:22.054 --> 13:24.156
We could have the whole
town chewing our food.

13:24.189 --> 13:26.826
Steve, if you don't stop this right now,

13:26.860 --> 13:29.763
we will force you to stop.

13:29.795 --> 13:33.467
You can stop me,
but you got to stop Marshall first.

13:33.500 --> 13:35.137
Bye-bye, boys.

13:37.303 --> 13:39.039

13:39.072 --> 13:41.942

13:45.044 --> 13:47.447
Pretty cool, huh?

13:47.480 --> 13:49.549
On one hand, thank you.

13:49.582 --> 13:52.552
On the other,
you just murdered a student!

13:52.584 --> 13:53.953
That wasn't a student.

13:53.986 --> 13:56.722
That was a zombie
created by Blood Magic!

13:56.755 --> 13:59.892
I know, for I am
of a line of witch hunters

13:59.925 --> 14:01.994
entrusted to protect this school.

14:02.028 --> 14:04.331
I'll find whoever made this demon.

14:04.364 --> 14:07.701
And when I do,
I'm gonna crossbow his ass.

14:07.733 --> 14:09.902
If you want to keep
your asses uncrossbowed,

14:09.935 --> 14:15.408

'cause Blood Magic is dud magic.

15:24.595 --> 15:26.999

straight to Steve's head.

15:38.877 --> 15:41.547

15:41.580 --> 15:44.917
Aw, crap! The guy
I franchised this place from

get those deaths off my mind.

20:16.167 --> 20:17.723
I did like floating.

20:17.755 --> 20:21.359
My favorite part was having
a place to eat lunch!

20:22.033 --> 20:23.361
Don't worry. We'll get a table.

20:23.893 --> 20:25.597
Follow my lead.

20:27.353 --> 20:28.166
Ah.

20:28.571 --> 20:30.034
Marsh, buddy.

20:30.068 --> 20:31.636
How's that throwing arm?

20:31.668 --> 20:33.504
Are you freaking kidding me?!

20:35.106 --> 20:37.542

by the football players

20:40.043 --> 20:42.380
find a place to call their own.

20:42.414 --> 20:46.417
Guys, I forgot to tell you,
when you die, nothing happens.

20:46.451 --> 20:50.355
It's just a permanent
cessation of consciousness.
