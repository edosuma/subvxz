Oh, true love.
It's so beautiful.

10:33.734 --> 10:38.734
(YAWNING)
I got to get some sleep.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.542
(SNIFFS)

10:41.609 --> 10:46.259
(LOUD CAWING
AND MUSIC PLAYING)

10:47.247 --> 10:48.982
What now?

10:49.049 --> 10:53.788
It's our wedding song.

10:53.855 --> 10:56.657
We want you to be
the best man!

10:56.724 --> 11:00.226
Fine. But I ain't comin'
on the honeymoon.
