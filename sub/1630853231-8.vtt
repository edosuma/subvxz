WEBVTT

00:59.977 --> 01:01.186
You're up early.

01:01.270 --> 01:05.399
Yeah. Lottie was feeling stir-crazy
so I had to take her out for a ride.

01:05.983 --> 01:06.984
Lottie was?

01:08.527 --> 01:09.528
Made food.

01:10.404 --> 01:11.446
Yeah, I know.

01:25.127 --> 01:27.796
-Hey, I meant to ask--
-You need to knock.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.590
Sorry. Keep forgetting.

01:29.673 --> 01:33.093
I need my own space. Everyone just
keeps coming in here whenever they want.

01:33.177 --> 01:34.428
It's just the two of us.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.972
I have a curtain for a reason.
I have my own life.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.349
I don't need you in my space all the time.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.810
You seem pretty angry at me
these days, kid.

01:41.894 --> 01:44.104
I'm not. And I'm not a kid.

01:48.901 --> 01:52.821
If your mom were here, she'd know
how to talk to you about, you know,

01:52.905 --> 01:55.282
-all these changes you're going through.
-Oh, my God.

01:55.365 --> 01:58.660
Not-- I mean, yes, those too.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.038
But I mean all these feelings.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.499
When I was your age,
I was hungry or not hungry.

02:04.583 --> 02:08.711
Okay. Well, mom died
like a hundred years ago,

02:08.794 --> 02:10.756
so maybe it's time for you to move on.

02:13.926 --> 02:14.927
You're right.

02:18.305 --> 02:22.601
I got some business in town. Wanna come?
For old time's sake.

02:22.684 --> 02:26.688
-No, I'd rather stay here.
-Alone?

02:26.772 --> 02:28.857
I'm not alone. I've got Lottie.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.945
But what about that girl,
from down the road?

02:33.612 --> 02:35.280
The preacher's daughter?

02:35.364 --> 02:36.865
Isn't she your friend?

02:37.366 --> 02:39.618
I mean, we ran around a field
when we were babies,

02:39.701 --> 02:41.161
but that doesn't make us friends.

02:41.245 --> 02:44.039
Well, maybe she likes horses too.
You two could ride together.

02:44.122 --> 02:47.501
I bet Millie mostly doesn't even know
what sidesaddle means.

02:47.584 --> 02:49.086
Well, I always liked her.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.588
She always marched to the beat
of her own drum,

02:51.672 --> 02:54.258
which is more than you can say
for most of these girls around here.

02:58.971 --> 03:01.056
See you tonight, kid.
Love you.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.517
Bye.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.029
There you go.

03:17.823 --> 03:18.824
You're so pretty.

04:41.532 --> 04:43.200
Sorry for your loss, miss.

04:44.451 --> 04:47.621
I won't bother your delicate sensibilities
with all the details,

04:47.704 --> 04:51.750
but your father owed a Mr. Silas McCall
a whole bunch of money.

04:51.834 --> 04:54.253
And when Mr. McCall tried to collect
that money,

04:54.336 --> 04:56.004
your father pulled out a pistol.

04:57.256 --> 05:01.552
So Mr. McCall shot him.
In defense, which is justified.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.808
Where's his horse?

05:08.600 --> 05:09.852
He rode into town, didn't he?

05:09.935 --> 05:14.189
Horses run away all the time, miss.
But I'll put out a notice.

05:15.399 --> 05:17.860
Let me know if you need help
bringing home the body.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.493
Blessed are those who mourn,
for-- for they will be comforted.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.203
Not a good time, Millie.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.248
I'm sorry about your dad.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.832
Me too.

06:55.916 --> 07:00.629
For what it's worth, I'm eager to reunite
with him in heaven someday.

07:00.712 --> 07:01.547
Really?

07:02.548 --> 07:05.092
You're excited to hang out
with my dad in heaven?

07:05.175 --> 07:06.176
Yes.

07:06.552 --> 07:08.679
Even though you never
hung out with him on Earth?

07:09.179 --> 07:10.556
Well, he was a lot older.

07:12.307 --> 07:14.226
-I see you're wearing his clothes.
-Yep.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.145
Is that part of the mourning process?

07:17.229 --> 07:19.731
No. I'm heading into town
for some business.

07:21.817 --> 07:23.861
So, it's more of a disguise?

07:25.279 --> 07:26.280
Something like that.

07:27.406 --> 07:29.992
I know whenever I'm low in spirits,
I stop at Virgil's Apothecary.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.827
Always lifts me right back up.

07:31.910 --> 07:33.579
I'm not going to Virgil's.

07:33.662 --> 07:36.540
I'm going to the saloon to shoot
that coward Silas McCall.

07:39.001 --> 07:41.879
-Wait, what-- Like, right now?
-Yep.

07:41.962 --> 07:43.922
Are you even sure
you have the right Silas?

07:44.006 --> 07:46.717
'Cause there's-- there's Silas M.,
Mary's dad,

07:46.800 --> 07:50.679
-and then there's Silas F., Pearl's Dad--
-Millie. Shut up.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.725
Come on, Lottie. Let's go. Come on.

07:56.518 --> 07:57.519
-Good girl.
-Jane.

07:58.645 --> 07:59.646
Jane, wait.

08:01.565 --> 08:02.649
Wait up, Jane!

08:10.616 --> 08:13.577
-Did you just throw a biscuit at me?
-I'll come with you.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.412
Now, why would you do that?

08:15.495 --> 08:18.290
'Cause it seems like you could use
a friend right now.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.833
We're not friends.

08:19.917 --> 08:21.043
We used to be.

08:21.752 --> 08:25.714
And you seem awfully confused
with the hair and vest.

08:25.797 --> 08:28.592
You want to take revenge like a man,
you gotta dress like one.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.512
Or not take revenge, is the other option.

08:32.221 --> 08:35.015
Millie, I don't need you tagging along,
trying to stop me,

08:35.097 --> 08:36.850
spouting Bible quotes the whole way.

08:37.643 --> 08:40.979
Bible.
What is that, like, a book?

09:00.582 --> 09:02.584
How'd you learn how to ride like that?

09:04.211 --> 09:05.963
We should loop in the sheriff.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.714
He already knows and doesn't care.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.926
Well, someone just needs to explain
to him the full story.

09:11.009 --> 09:13.554
That Mary's dad went psycho
and needs to be thrown in jail

09:13.637 --> 09:15.305
so he can repent for his sins.

09:15.389 --> 09:18.934
And then you and I can go to church
and pray for forgiveness

09:19.017 --> 09:21.812
for even contemplating
what you're contemplating.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.230
If you are still contemplating it.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.982
Did you always talk this much?

09:25.065 --> 09:28.902
Yes. You were always
the strong, silent type.

09:28.986 --> 09:31.613
Kids at school thought you were mute,
you remember?

09:33.866 --> 09:35.284
-Say hi.
-Okay.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.120
Morning, Millie.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.538
I like your glasses.

09:40.289 --> 09:41.498
Thank you, Eleanor.

09:41.582 --> 09:44.042
-They're the latest technology for--
-They're making fun of you.

09:45.836 --> 09:48.380
Wait, Jane, no. Please don't do this.

09:48.964 --> 09:50.757
You're gonna regret it
for the rest of your life.

09:50.841 --> 09:53.427
It's going to be a stain on your soul.

09:53.510 --> 09:56.138
It's stupid and evil, and you'll never
be able to get into heaven

09:56.221 --> 09:57.931
with me and everyone else we know.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.225
Also, I think they'll hang you.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.397
Stay here. Watch my horse.

10:10.903 --> 10:14.031
I'm looking for Silas McCall.
He owns this place, doesn't he?

10:17.075 --> 10:19.995
-Yeah, but he's not here.
-Well, where the hell is he?

10:20.078 --> 10:22.539
I don't know.
I don't keep his schedule on me.

10:28.003 --> 10:31.006
He didn't mean it, Lord.
Forgive him! Forgive us all!

10:34.635 --> 10:37.095
-What happened?
-I told you to stay outside.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.890
Aren't you the preacher's girl?

10:41.141 --> 10:42.226
I am.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.606
Tell your dad I'm sorry
I keep skipping church.

10:47.689 --> 10:49.650
I've been real busy lately, and I--

10:49.733 --> 10:51.902
I'll pass along the message when we leave.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.487
Which we'll do now.

10:53.570 --> 10:54.947
Before we do, where's Silas?

10:55.989 --> 10:57.115
You don't need to reveal that information.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.408
Tell me.

10:58.492 --> 11:02.329
He's on a hunting expedition,
about 20 miles north of here.

11:02.913 --> 11:04.331
Along the Troublesome River.

11:05.040 --> 11:06.917
But I wouldn't go after him alone.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.586
He's a quick draw
with an even quicker temper.

11:10.379 --> 11:13.257
-Man could shoot a fly 80 yards out.
-Why?

11:13.757 --> 11:14.758
"Why," what?

11:14.842 --> 11:17.511
Why would he do that? Shoot a fly.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.137
We're taking these.

11:19.221 --> 11:21.682
As-- As penance for revealing
that information.

11:41.952 --> 11:43.620
What are we going to do?

11:44.621 --> 11:47.207
We can't go back home.
We're outlaws now.

11:48.083 --> 11:51.170
You can go back.
I'm sure your parents will understand.

11:51.837 --> 11:52.963
Are you kidding?

11:53.589 --> 11:57.301
Do you know what they would do if they
found out I robbed a saloon at gunpoint?

11:57.801 --> 12:01.555
I robbed a saloon at gunpoint.
You're my unwitting accomplice.

12:05.100 --> 12:07.853
Well,
if I do go back home,

12:07.936 --> 12:11.356
I-- I have to babysit my seven brothers
and sisters.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.526
I have to help with the cooking
and the cleaning

12:14.610 --> 12:16.278
and setting up the church.

12:17.988 --> 12:19.656
I have to find a husband.

12:19.740 --> 12:21.366
I thought you were married to Jesus.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.329
Okay. All right, all right, okay.

12:26.580 --> 12:28.874
Tonight, we stay here.
We camp, we collect our thoughts.

12:28.957 --> 12:30.501
And then in the morning,

12:30.584 --> 12:33.253
we say we were kidnapped
and/or temporarily possessed.

12:34.129 --> 12:35.756
You can say whatever you want.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.759
I'm riding to the Troublesome River,
and I'm killing that asshole.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.178
Didn't you hear what that barman
said about Silas shooting flies?

12:41.261 --> 12:43.013
Well, good thing I'm not a fly.

12:48.977 --> 12:51.146
Jane. That's alcohol.

12:53.190 --> 12:54.566
Oh, shit, really?

12:55.859 --> 12:57.152
I thought this was punch.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.238
Have you ever had it before?

12:59.947 --> 13:00.948
No.

13:02.157 --> 13:03.158
-You?
-Of course not.

13:04.451 --> 13:08.372
Spirits turn you into a slut or a witch.
Sometimes both.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.541
-You're not curious?
-No.

13:35.399 --> 13:39.486
Isn't it weird how when girls are little,

13:39.570 --> 13:42.614
they're all obsessed with horses?

13:45.325 --> 13:47.578
Then they grow up,
and they're just supposed to be

13:47.661 --> 13:49.746
in the kitchen with children.

13:50.956 --> 13:53.500
Yeah, it's weird.

13:57.296 --> 14:00.007
Not you though. You still like horses.

14:01.049 --> 14:02.384
I do.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.974
I think they're terrifying.

14:09.975 --> 14:12.227
You just gotta learn
how to connect to them.

14:16.315 --> 14:17.316
You wanna dance?

14:18.275 --> 14:20.027
No. I'm good.

14:23.697 --> 14:26.950
Right, you're still in mourning.

14:27.951 --> 14:29.828
Are you too sad to dance?

14:30.746 --> 14:33.874
I don't like dancing.
I like riding.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.376
That's all.

14:42.049 --> 14:45.427
I'm not supposed to dance.

14:46.303 --> 14:47.804
'Cause…

14:53.143 --> 14:54.645
Something about the devil.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.271
I don't remember.

14:58.440 --> 15:01.235
But, sometimes,

15:01.902 --> 15:04.655
I put on my mom's hoopskirts.

15:04.738 --> 15:08.867
And I do high kicks,
and I pretend I'm a dance-hall girl.

15:10.536 --> 15:14.248
Like a proper one
who doesn't do any of the bad stuff.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.250
Come on, you should try.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.668
Come on. Come on.

15:20.629 --> 15:21.839
High kicks.

15:25.217 --> 15:29.388
Or-- Or there's also
like jumping dancing.

15:30.055 --> 15:31.640
Which I think you would like.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.273
Son of a biscuit.

16:50.302 --> 16:51.553
Come on, Lottie.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.127
I know you're in there, McCall!

18:09.173 --> 18:10.716
I've got a gun.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.342
Don't shoot. We're harmless.

18:13.969 --> 18:14.970
It's her.

18:17.181 --> 18:20.184
Millie? What the hell are you doing here?

18:20.267 --> 18:21.768
What am I doing here?

18:22.561 --> 18:24.104
You're the one who left me for dead.

18:24.188 --> 18:26.481
Thank goodness I ran into
Old Doc Henry here.

18:26.565 --> 18:29.318
I practice medicine in the nation
across the river.

18:29.401 --> 18:31.862
My father and I sometimes travel
with him on his rounds,

18:31.945 --> 18:34.781
-spreading the good word.
-I thought she was a turkey.

18:34.865 --> 18:35.866
One second.

18:37.534 --> 18:39.578
-You left me for dead.
-I was coming back for you.

18:39.661 --> 18:40.787
Like heck you were.

18:40.871 --> 18:42.873
This was just like the time
you ditched me after school

18:42.956 --> 18:44.291
to smoke cigars with Lyle Thomas.

18:44.374 --> 18:45.417
This isn't about you.

18:45.501 --> 18:48.420
That's the problem.
I'm out here risking my life for you,

18:48.504 --> 18:50.797
and you're too self-involved to even care.

18:51.882 --> 18:53.884
-You chose to come along.
-Because you're acting crazy.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.385
-I'm angry.
-So?

18:56.345 --> 18:58.639
Think all angry people should
just go around shooting people?

18:59.556 --> 19:02.017
-Maybe.
-You never even said thank you.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.728
You wouldn't know McCall's whereabouts
in the first place if it weren't for me.

19:04.811 --> 19:08.190
So that's what this is about.
You needing a thank you?

19:08.774 --> 19:10.108
-Wouldn't hurt.
-Fine.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.528
Thank you, Millie.

19:12.611 --> 19:15.489
Thank you for being so lonely
and bored with your own life

19:15.572 --> 19:17.074
that you're glomming onto mine.

19:17.783 --> 19:20.786
-That wasn't very nice.
-I don't have time for politeness.

19:20.869 --> 19:23.997
My dad's horse is right there. See?

19:24.081 --> 19:26.667
And on it is a saddle
he was gonna give me.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.544
So I'm going to take back his horse,

19:28.627 --> 19:31.213
take back his saddle,
and I'm going to wait right here

19:31.296 --> 19:32.339
till Silas McCall returns,

19:32.422 --> 19:34.383
and I'm going to shoot him
between the eyes.

19:34.883 --> 19:36.051
So you can watch…

19:37.386 --> 19:39.346
or you can wake up the old man
and fuck off.

19:39.930 --> 19:40.931
Wake him up?

19:47.896 --> 19:52.025
All right, Doc. She's not coming.
Let's go.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.074
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

20:06.206 --> 20:07.374
He's dead.

20:08.625 --> 20:09.960
What do we do?

20:11.003 --> 20:14.006
Nothing. The old man died
of natural causes.

20:14.089 --> 20:16.550
He's a good Christian.
He needs a proper burial.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.886
-Help me move him.
-I don't have time.

20:18.969 --> 20:20.429
Help me move him, or I'll scream!

20:27.728 --> 20:30.397
Woman's crazier than popcorn
on a hot stove.

20:31.607 --> 20:33.150
-Go hide.
-What about the body?

20:33.233 --> 20:35.444
Yeah, but I'll still fuck her.

20:37.237 --> 20:38.280
Who goes there?

20:43.535 --> 20:44.620
State your business.

20:50.626 --> 20:55.255
Oh, thank goodness you're here.
Oh, my goodness. Oh, praise be the Lord.

20:55.339 --> 20:58.175
We were so scared till you brave,
strong men arrived.

20:59.301 --> 21:00.552
Do I know you two?

21:01.637 --> 21:05.307
No. My name is Sadie.
This is my brother Clayton.

21:06.099 --> 21:09.770
We was walking home from church when,
bam! Kidnapped by bandits.

21:12.189 --> 21:13.273
Is this true?

21:17.569 --> 21:18.570
Yeah.

21:19.655 --> 21:20.656
Who's the body?

21:21.657 --> 21:22.950
One of the bandits.

21:23.951 --> 21:25.160
Seems kinda old.

21:27.287 --> 21:29.081
I think your arrival spooked him.

21:29.164 --> 21:31.041
He dropped dead as soon
as he heard your voices.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.710
Then the other bandits ran off
into these here woods.

21:43.512 --> 21:44.888
You best come inside.

22:23.177 --> 22:26.680
Sorry. Didn't realize how hungry I was.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.517
Why's he so quiet?

22:30.601 --> 22:33.854
You know how boys are.
Keeping it all in.

22:33.937 --> 22:38.483
I always tell him, "You gotta let it
all out. No matter what's in your heart.

22:38.567 --> 22:41.904
No matter how ugly it is.
Else you'll explode."

22:42.613 --> 22:46.450
Some men use silence to convey
power and resolve.

22:47.034 --> 22:49.870
Not me. I'm as loud as a hog.

22:54.583 --> 22:57.336
Is that your horse outside?
The brown one?

22:57.836 --> 23:00.297
Yeah. Why?

23:01.215 --> 23:02.883
Seems kind of old.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.510
It's a shit horse.

23:05.010 --> 23:09.223
Think I'll probably give it to my girl.
She loves horses.

23:15.145 --> 23:17.356
-You mean Mary?
-Goddamn it, Millie. Move.

23:18.899 --> 23:19.900
You know her?

23:21.068 --> 23:24.321
We went to school together.
It's why we're here.

23:25.072 --> 23:26.114
Did she send you?

23:26.865 --> 23:29.451
She did. She wanted us
to bring you a message.

23:30.577 --> 23:33.080
Well we haven't been in touch
in a long time.

23:36.542 --> 23:38.919
We know. It pains her.

23:56.061 --> 23:58.146
Does she blame me for the estrangement?

23:59.606 --> 24:00.941
She does.

24:01.567 --> 24:03.527
She can forgive you for being
a degenerate, she said,

24:03.610 --> 24:07.906
but not for being
such a neglectful father.

24:10.701 --> 24:13.412
You think that's why she's still working
at Diddlin Dora's?

24:13.495 --> 24:16.206
Probably. She also said…

24:17.708 --> 24:19.751
she was disappointed in you.

24:20.878 --> 24:22.838
Going around murdering people.

24:22.921 --> 24:26.258
Caring more about people fearing you
than being a good father.

24:27.843 --> 24:30.846
Well, that's just--
That's just being a man.

24:33.140 --> 24:34.516
It's what men do.

24:37.060 --> 24:39.938
Do all men sleep
with their brother's wives?

24:43.483 --> 24:44.693
How do you know about that?

24:46.987 --> 24:50.032
Don't blame me.
I'm just the messenger.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.911
Mary… I remember her.

24:55.913 --> 24:57.873
Wasn't she the one that would fuck
the judge's son

24:57.956 --> 25:01.084
-every Friday behind the schoolhouse?
-Yeah. Yes, I think so.

25:01.585 --> 25:06.089
She would orgasm so loud.
The whole class would hear.

25:06.673 --> 25:10.302
I mean, she was so good at math,
she could have run her own business.

25:10.385 --> 25:12.638
-Well, you know, I guess she is.
-Stop!

25:13.847 --> 25:16.767
Please just-- Just stop.

25:21.897 --> 25:23.190
Tell Mary I'm sorry.

25:25.234 --> 25:26.985
I know I'm a worthless piece of shit.

25:29.321 --> 25:31.698
But please, I beg you,
just tell her to come home.

25:34.868 --> 25:35.869
I beg you.

25:37.996 --> 25:39.373
This pain--

25:41.750 --> 25:42.876
Gosh.

25:42.960 --> 25:45.796
I just wish someone would just put
a bullet in my skull.

25:51.802 --> 25:52.845
I'm sorry.

25:53.762 --> 25:54.930
We can't do that.

25:55.013 --> 25:56.056
Oh, please.

25:58.141 --> 25:59.184
Please, you must.

26:03.522 --> 26:08.318
Mary's not interested in apologies.
They're meaningless.

26:10.487 --> 26:13.240
Your endless suffering is apology enough.

26:16.910 --> 26:20.747
But we can take her your horse outside.
The brown one.

26:22.916 --> 26:26.962
I don't know if she'll accept it,
but we can try.

26:31.592 --> 26:34.303
How'd you know about sleeping
with his brother's wife?

26:35.053 --> 26:36.471
My dad's the preacher.

26:36.555 --> 26:38.640
People share all sorts
of information with him.

26:39.808 --> 26:41.435
Thank you for your help, Millie.

26:42.686 --> 26:44.271
-You wanted him on his knees.
-I did.

26:44.354 --> 26:46.356
And I'm pretty sure
he would have killed you.

26:46.857 --> 26:48.525
And you're my best friend.

26:54.865 --> 26:56.033
I'll ride Lottie.

26:58.327 --> 26:59.494
You can ride my dad's horse.

27:02.456 --> 27:05.125
I can't. Jane, I-- I don't know how.

27:05.209 --> 27:07.294
It's easy. I can show you.

27:14.676 --> 27:15.677
You ready?

27:27.773 --> 27:29.483
This is a lot easier
with a saddle.

27:29.566 --> 27:30.567
You're talking.

27:30.651 --> 27:32.402
I can talk and ride at the same time.

27:32.486 --> 27:34.530
Yeah, said the girl
who used to be terrified of horses.

27:34.613 --> 27:37.324
-Come on, let's go.
-I'm still terrified.

27:37.866 --> 27:39.910
We should go find more men
to emotionally torment.

27:39.993 --> 27:41.537
Come on, Millie. Try to keep up.

27:41.620 --> 27:45.165
Trying. What if I fall off?
Can you fall off a horse?
