<i>followed Chester upstairs</i>

01:16.142 --> 01:17.643
<i>to his hotel room.</i>

01:24.651 --> 01:26.652
We better get started.

01:26.653 --> 01:29.154
I'm parked
in the 20-minute zone.

01:33.159 --> 01:35.160
Who is it?

01:35.161 --> 01:37.663
Jessica.

01:37.664 --> 01:38.664
Uh, oh, my God.

01:38.665 --> 01:41.166
Hide.

01:41.167 --> 01:43.669
Jessica who?

01:43.670 --> 01:46.171
It's me, Chester.

01:46.172 --> 01:49.174
Chester who?

01:49.175 --> 01:50.676
It's Jessica, Chester.

01:50.677 --> 01:53.679
Is it Jessica or Chester?

01:53.680 --> 01:55.181
Make up your mind.

01:56.182 --> 01:59.685
No, not there.

01:59.686 --> 02:01.186
Chester, it is me,

02:01.187 --> 02:03.188
your wife, Jessica Tate.

02:03.189 --> 02:05.691
Oh, Jessica Tate.

02:05.692 --> 02:08.693
Well, I'm on the phone, Jess.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.697
I'll be right with you.

02:15.201 --> 02:16.702
Get down on all fours.

02:16.703 --> 02:18.204
Now, Chester?

02:21.207 --> 02:22.207
Uh... no.

02:24.210 --> 02:27.212
You're going to be a table.

02:27.213 --> 02:29.715
You're weird, Chester.

02:33.219 --> 02:34.219
JESSICA:
Chester?

02:34.220 --> 02:36.722
I'm on the phone, Jess.

02:36.723 --> 02:38.223
All right.

02:38.224 --> 02:39.725
Don't move.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.226
Don't breathe.

02:42.228 --> 02:43.228
Chester!

02:43.229 --> 02:45.231
Don't make any noise.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.240
Ooh!

02:55.241 --> 02:56.241
Sorry.

02:56.242 --> 02:58.243
Chester, I know
you are in there.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.746
You open this door
right this minute.

03:00.747 --> 03:04.249
Jess, what brings you here?

03:04.250 --> 03:07.252
That is my question, Chester.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.254
What brings you here?

03:09.255 --> 03:11.256
Uh, well, Jess,
since I don't have a job,

03:11.257 --> 03:13.759
I have no place to go.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.262
I use this
as my office, you see.

03:17.263 --> 03:18.764
I work out of here.

03:18.765 --> 03:20.767
I see.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.773
Chester, I have to go
to the bathroom.

03:28.274 --> 03:29.274
Okay.

03:29.275 --> 03:31.276
You mean you don't mind

03:31.277 --> 03:33.278
if I go to the bathroom?

03:33.279 --> 03:37.283
No, I'd rather you go in there
than in here.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.302
Looking for something?

03:57.303 --> 03:59.805
Decorating ideas.

03:59.806 --> 04:01.307
Ahh.

04:08.314 --> 04:09.815
Chester...

04:09.816 --> 04:13.318
I have a confession
to make to you.

04:13.319 --> 04:15.320
I thought that I saw you

04:15.321 --> 04:16.822
come up here with another woman,

04:16.822 --> 04:18.322
and I followed you.

04:18.324 --> 04:19.825
Oh, gee.

04:19.826 --> 04:23.829
Now, Chester, I am so sorry.

04:23.830 --> 04:28.333
I'm sorry I mistrusted you,
but I am glad I came.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.835
Otherwise, Chester,

04:29.836 --> 04:36.342
those doubts would've lingered
with me forever and ever.

04:39.345 --> 04:41.346
I... I'm shocked,
Jess.

04:41.347 --> 04:44.349
Shocked...

04:44.350 --> 04:47.352
and deeply hurt
that you don't trust me...

04:47.353 --> 04:49.354
I'm sorry, Chester.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.356
But I have promised you, Jess,

04:51.357 --> 04:53.859
I have sworn to you
that those days are over.

04:53.860 --> 04:55.861
How much longer are you
going to make me pay?

04:56.863 --> 04:58.363
How much longer are you

04:58.364 --> 05:02.367
going to torture me like this?

05:02.368 --> 05:05.371
Chester...

05:08.374 --> 05:10.375
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.878
Oh, sorry, yes,
you're very sorry, Jess.

05:12.879 --> 05:13.879
You're always sorry.

05:13.880 --> 05:14.880
Meanwhile...

05:14.881 --> 05:17.382
you watch every
little move I make.

05:17.383 --> 05:19.143
You're ready to pounce
on every little thing.

05:28.394 --> 05:29.395
What's that?

05:31.397 --> 05:32.397
It's a new thing.

05:32.398 --> 05:36.401
Italian furniture.

05:36.402 --> 05:38.403
It's moving, Chester.

05:38.404 --> 05:39.404
What is it?

05:39.405 --> 05:41.407
A sheep.

05:52.418 --> 05:55.420
I am so glad

05:55.421 --> 05:58.423
you have this hotel room,
Chester,

05:58.424 --> 06:03.429
because you are not coming home.

06:12.438 --> 06:14.440
Hey, Mare.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.946
Burt, what are you
doing in here?

06:20.947 --> 06:22.948
I don't know why
they call you in

06:22.949 --> 06:23.949
from the waiting room

06:23.950 --> 06:24.950
to wait in the examining room.

06:24.951 --> 06:25.951
At least out there,

06:25.952 --> 06:26.952
I can wear my pants

06:26.953 --> 06:27.953
and read <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>

06:27.954 --> 06:28.954
I know.

06:28.955 --> 06:30.455
They weigh you
and forget about you.

06:30.456 --> 06:31.456
Oh, yeah.

06:31.457 --> 06:33.959
I hate getting a physical.

06:33.960 --> 06:35.460
At least it's only once a year.

06:35.461 --> 06:37.462
You can't even take a nap
while you're waiting.

06:37.463 --> 06:38.964
You could roll
right off that table,

06:38.965 --> 06:40.465
and here, you could
lie on the floor

06:40.466 --> 06:41.967
and bleed to death.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.468
You've got a better chance
of getting medical help

06:43.469 --> 06:45.470
on the golf course.

06:45.471 --> 06:47.973
Burt, don't you think
you should go back to your room?

06:47.974 --> 06:49.975
The doctor might be there
by now.

06:49.976 --> 06:50.976
No, he's not.

06:50.977 --> 06:53.979
He's on the phone. I heard.

06:53.980 --> 06:56.482
He's buying the Grand Canyon
to build condominiums.

06:59.485 --> 07:00.485
Here, this here.

07:00.486 --> 07:02.487
Look at this over here.
Look at that.

07:02.488 --> 07:03.989
I'm an inch taller on this one.

07:03.990 --> 07:05.490
I grew in the hall.
I'm going home.

07:05.491 --> 07:06.491
Burt.

07:06.492 --> 07:07.993
Mary, please.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.494
I can't stand around all day

07:09.495 --> 07:11.496
while he buys Arizona.

07:11.497 --> 07:13.498
Not dressed like this, I can't.

07:13.499 --> 07:14.499
Look at this, will you?

07:14.500 --> 07:16.001
Pink and blue.

07:16.002 --> 07:19.004
We know what we are.

07:19.005 --> 07:22.007
Maybe they can't tell.

07:22.008 --> 07:24.009
Yeah, I'm going home, Mare.
Come on.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.510
Oh, Burt, come on.

07:25.511 --> 07:26.511
You need a physical.

07:26.512 --> 07:28.013
You've had insomnia.

07:28.014 --> 07:29.514
I think you should find out why.

07:29.515 --> 07:30.515
Mare, I know why.

07:30.516 --> 07:33.018
There's no great mystery why.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.522
I got space lag.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.524
Burt...

07:39.525 --> 07:40.525
Come on, Mary, please.

07:40.526 --> 07:41.526
There's jet lag...

07:41.527 --> 07:42.527
There's jet lag, right?

07:42.528 --> 07:44.529
This is space lag.
It's much worse.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.530
Space lag?

07:45.531 --> 07:47.032
Oh, doc, fancy seeing you here.

07:47.033 --> 07:49.535
What happened,
the stock market close?

07:53.039 --> 07:54.039
Hi, Burt.

07:54.040 --> 07:55.040
Hi, Mary.
Hi.

07:55.041 --> 07:56.541
Hey, two in one room

07:56.542 --> 07:58.543
doesn't reduce the rate,
you know, huh?

07:58.544 --> 08:00.045
Hey, you look wonderful.

08:00.046 --> 08:01.546
Pink.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.548
Well, I might as well
start with Mary, huh?

08:03.549 --> 08:05.550
Go ahead.
I think you should start with Burt.

08:05.551 --> 08:06.551
He's the one with the symptoms.

08:06.552 --> 08:08.553
Symptoms.
What symptoms, Mary?

08:08.554 --> 08:09.554
Come on, it's nothing.

08:09.555 --> 08:10.555
What, a little insomnia.

08:10.556 --> 08:11.556
Who cares?

08:11.557 --> 08:12.557
A few more days

08:12.558 --> 08:14.059
of adjusting to Earth time...

08:14.060 --> 08:15.060
I'll be tip-top.

08:15.061 --> 08:16.061
Earth time?

08:16.062 --> 08:18.064
Yeah, Earth time...

08:23.569 --> 08:26.071
You see,
there were these space men,

08:26.072 --> 08:28.073
and I went with them
up on their spaceship,

08:28.074 --> 08:30.076
and I got a real bad case
of space lag, that's all.

08:31.577 --> 08:34.578
Hey, I've flown to Cincinnati
and been a zombie.

08:34.580 --> 08:36.581
When I travel with space men,

08:36.582 --> 08:38.082
I have a terrible time sleeping.

08:38.083 --> 08:41.586
There, you see that?

08:41.587 --> 08:43.587
I also can't eat their food.

08:46.092 --> 08:47.592
Tell me about it.

08:47.593 --> 08:48.593
It's cocktail food.

08:50.096 --> 08:52.097
Yeah, I lost six pounds.

08:54.600 --> 08:58.603
Burt, you're crazy.

08:58.604 --> 08:59.604
You're one funny guy.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.606
We have the same sense of humor.

09:01.607 --> 09:02.607
You do.

09:02.608 --> 09:05.611
Yeah, that's really funny there.

09:08.614 --> 09:09.614
All right, okay.

09:09.615 --> 09:10.615
Oh, all right.

09:10.616 --> 09:11.616
You first, huh, you first.

09:11.617 --> 09:12.617
Okay, okay.

09:12.618 --> 09:13.618
Burt, Burt,
while you're waiting,

09:13.619 --> 09:15.620
Florence will come in
and take some blood.

09:15.621 --> 09:18.123
Is she the one
that always misses the vein?

09:18.124 --> 09:19.624
Florence?

09:19.625 --> 09:22.127
Because you got one out there
that's blind.

09:22.128 --> 09:23.128
You don't have to worry.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.129
Florence is very good.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.630
Oh, and after she's done,

09:25.631 --> 09:27.132
you might try to fill
the little plastic cup...

09:27.133 --> 09:29.134
Oh, I hate that.
No, I hate that.

09:29.135 --> 09:30.135
I can't do it.

09:30.136 --> 09:31.636
Sure you can.

09:31.637 --> 09:32.637
I can't do it.

09:32.638 --> 09:33.638
I'm terrible under pressure.

09:33.639 --> 09:35.140
Turn on the water.

09:35.141 --> 09:36.142
It'll inspire you.

09:37.643 --> 09:38.643
Turn on the water.

09:38.644 --> 09:40.145
Beer. A couple of beers
will do it.

09:40.146 --> 09:42.147
That's all you need,

09:42.148 --> 09:43.648
a couple of beers,
you got no problem.

09:43.649 --> 09:44.649
You want me?

09:44.650 --> 09:45.650
I'll be around the corner

09:45.651 --> 09:46.652
in the bar.

09:55.161 --> 09:56.161
Hi.

09:56.162 --> 09:57.162
Hey, Danny, you hungry?

09:57.163 --> 09:58.663
No.

09:58.664 --> 09:59.664
Oh, Danny, what's the matter?

09:59.665 --> 10:00.665
You look terrible.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.167
I got a problem, Burt.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.169
Well, that's what I'm here for.
Let me have it.

10:04.170 --> 10:07.172
I met this girl,
and I'm going crazy

10:07.173 --> 10:09.174
because I don't know how
to get in touch with her.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.175
Where'd you meet her?

10:10.176 --> 10:11.177
In a cemetery.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.681
You pick up girls
in the cemetery?

10:16.682 --> 10:19.184
It's a long story.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.185
It's crazy.

10:20.186 --> 10:21.186
The world is overflowing
with discos.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.687
He goes to a cemetery.

10:22.688 --> 10:25.190
I was there
visiting Elaine's grave,

10:25.191 --> 10:27.692
and she was there
visiting her husband's grave,

10:27.693 --> 10:28.693
and we started talking.

10:28.694 --> 10:30.695
Sounds romantic.

10:32.198 --> 10:33.198
Not really,

10:33.199 --> 10:34.199
and like a jerk,

10:34.200 --> 10:36.201
I forgot to ask
for her phone number.

10:36.202 --> 10:37.702
Come on, you don't just waltz up

10:37.703 --> 10:39.204
to somebody who's in mourning
and say,

10:39.205 --> 10:40.705
"Excuse me, but when
you're finished talking

10:40.706 --> 10:41.706
"to your dearly departed,

10:41.707 --> 10:43.208
would you slip me
your phone number?"

10:43.209 --> 10:44.709
Well, then,
what should I do, Burt?

10:44.710 --> 10:45.710
Danny, come on.

10:45.711 --> 10:47.212
Think, think, think.

10:47.213 --> 10:52.217
She was talking to her
husband's grave... right?

10:52.218 --> 10:53.218
Yeah, so?

10:53.219 --> 10:56.721
So, on the stone,
there is information.

10:56.722 --> 10:58.723
Burt, they don't put
phone numbers

10:58.724 --> 11:00.225
on people's graves.

11:00.226 --> 11:03.728
No, Danny, Danny,
the name, the name.

11:03.729 --> 11:04.729
There's a name on the stone.

11:04.730 --> 11:06.231
The name, of course!

11:06.232 --> 11:07.232
There was a name.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.233
You're a genius, Burt.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.234
All right.
All right.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.235
Now, think, now.

11:10.236 --> 11:11.236
What was his name?

11:11.237 --> 11:12.238
Peter.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.240
Terrific.

11:15.241 --> 11:17.742
Call every Peter in Connecticut.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.744
If one doesn't answer,
that's him.

11:19.745 --> 11:23.248
Peter and Polly...

11:23.249 --> 11:24.749
Mr. and Mrs. Peter...

11:26.151 --> 11:27.752
Damn, it's right on the tip
of my tongue.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.754
You know, it's funny
you should mention cemeteries,

11:29.755 --> 11:31.256
because I've had
this cemetery idea

11:31.257 --> 11:32.257
kicking around in my head here,

11:32.258 --> 11:33.758
and I just...

11:33.759 --> 11:35.760
You know, we're running out
of cemetery space.

11:35.761 --> 11:36.761
Now, what if we took a state

11:36.762 --> 11:39.264
that nobody hardly ever uses,

11:39.265 --> 11:41.766
like North Dakota.

11:41.767 --> 11:43.268
We knock down the mountains...
whew,

11:43.269 --> 11:45.270
we got a gigantic cemetery.

11:45.271 --> 11:48.273
I can almost see it. Pete.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.775
"Here lies Peter..."

11:50.776 --> 11:53.778
Even better than that,
listen to this one here:

11:53.779 --> 11:55.780
high-rise cemeteries.

11:55.781 --> 11:58.283
Peter and Polly...

11:58.284 --> 12:00.785
Everybody gets a drawer.

12:00.786 --> 12:03.288
It'll look like
one huge filing cabinet.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.290
Of course, we've got to be
very tasteful about it.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.291
Here, just figure.

12:06.292 --> 12:07.292
See this, now.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.793
This is Mr. A's slot, right?

12:08.794 --> 12:10.795
Voop, toom.

12:10.796 --> 12:15.300
His wife... Their cousin Al...

12:15.301 --> 12:20.805
The twins...
And old Uncle Harvey.

12:20.806 --> 12:21.806
Dawson!

12:21.807 --> 12:23.308
And the Dawsons.
What the hell?

12:23.309 --> 12:24.310
It's a gold mine.

12:26.312 --> 12:27.312
Polly Dawson.

12:27.313 --> 12:29.814
Dawson. That's the name.

12:29.815 --> 12:30.815
Hi.

12:30.816 --> 12:31.816
Hey, Jodie.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.818
I left Wendy
with Corinne for the day

12:33.819 --> 12:36.321
just so I could get away.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.822
Uh, Burt?

12:37.823 --> 12:38.823
Yeah?

12:38.824 --> 12:41.326
Are you you, or are you him?

12:41.327 --> 12:42.327
No, that's right.

12:42.328 --> 12:43.328
No, it's all over now.

12:43.329 --> 12:44.329
I'm me.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.330
There's nothing,
no problem. I'm me.

12:45.331 --> 12:46.331
How can I be sure?

12:46.332 --> 12:47.332
Jodie, please.

12:47.333 --> 12:48.333
Come on, prove it.

12:48.334 --> 12:50.835
Your mother's
maiden name was Gatling.

12:50.836 --> 12:51.836
Not good enough.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.838
Corinne Tate was adopted.

12:53.839 --> 12:55.340
Nothing.

12:55.341 --> 12:57.342
You went to your junior prom
with Mike Finnegan.

12:57.343 --> 12:58.843
Hiya, Burt.

12:58.844 --> 13:01.346
All right.

13:01.347 --> 13:03.848
Dawson.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.350
Dawson, Peter.

13:05.351 --> 13:07.352
There's two columns
of Peter Dawson.

13:07.353 --> 13:09.354
Who's he looking for?

13:09.355 --> 13:11.356
Peter Dawson.

13:11.357 --> 13:12.357
Who's that?

13:12.358 --> 13:13.358
Some dead guy.

13:13.359 --> 13:15.860
He wants to date his wife.

13:15.861 --> 13:18.863
That's playing it safe.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.365
Hello.

13:20.366 --> 13:23.368
Hello, yeah,
are you Peter Dawson?

13:23.369 --> 13:26.871
Oh. Oh, you're alive, then,
is that it?

13:26.872 --> 13:27.872
He's alive.

13:27.873 --> 13:30.875
There goes the weekend.

13:30.876 --> 13:33.378
Oh, listen, one more question.

13:33.379 --> 13:35.380
What color are you?

13:35.381 --> 13:38.383
Hello? Hello?

13:38.384 --> 13:41.386
"What color are you?"

13:41.387 --> 13:42.887
You ask a man if he's dead,

13:42.888 --> 13:44.389
then you ask him
what color he is?

13:44.390 --> 13:45.890
Come on, forget it,
will you, Burt?

13:45.891 --> 13:46.891
It's nothing.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.393
Wait a minute, wait a minute,

13:48.394 --> 13:49.394
wait a minute.

13:49.395 --> 13:50.395
What color are you?

13:50.396 --> 13:52.397
This woman, this woman,

13:52.398 --> 13:55.400
what...?
Is what, black?

13:55.401 --> 13:56.901
Yeah, what of it?

13:56.902 --> 14:00.405
A black woman?

14:02.408 --> 14:04.409
I don't see
anything wrong with it.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.412
Of course not, you date guys.

14:08.414 --> 14:10.415
I mean, what's a black lady
next to that?

14:10.416 --> 14:11.416
Nothing.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.917
You could walk in here
with a goat,

14:12.918 --> 14:13.919
I wouldn't blink.

14:15.421 --> 14:17.422
First he marries
a gangster's daughter,

14:17.423 --> 14:21.426
now he's in love
with a black widow.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.928
I never thought I'd hear you
talk like this, Burt.

14:23.929 --> 14:24.929
Talk like what?

14:24.930 --> 14:26.431
Just because

14:26.432 --> 14:27.432
I don't want him
to hurt himself?

14:27.433 --> 14:28.933
That's not what you said, Dad.

14:28.934 --> 14:30.935
Danny, that's the only reason
I said anything here.

14:30.936 --> 14:31.936
Wait a minute, you under...

14:31.937 --> 14:32.937
Danny.

14:32.938 --> 14:35.440
This has nothing to do
with black people.

14:35.441 --> 14:37.942
I just don't want you
to complicate your life.

14:37.943 --> 14:40.445
Come on,
it's complicated enough.

14:40.446 --> 14:41.446
Listen, Burt.

14:41.447 --> 14:42.947
Yesterday was the first time

14:42.948 --> 14:45.450
I enjoyed being with somebody
since Elaine,

14:45.451 --> 14:46.451
and I'm gonna find out why,

14:46.452 --> 14:49.954
so you can either help me
or leave me alone.

14:49.955 --> 14:50.955
All right, Danny.

14:50.956 --> 14:51.956
All right, all right, all right.

14:51.957 --> 14:52.957
All right, we'll help.

14:52.958 --> 14:53.958
Come on, sit.

14:53.959 --> 14:54.959
Come on, sit.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.461
Tell us what you want us to do.

14:56.462 --> 14:57.962
All right.

14:57.963 --> 14:59.964
I figure if we hang out
in the cemetery long enough,

14:59.965 --> 15:01.966
she's bound to come back
to visit her husband,

15:01.967 --> 15:03.468
and when she does, we got her.

15:03.469 --> 15:05.470
So you want us to hang out
in the cemetery.

15:05.471 --> 15:07.972
Yeah. Now, we'll break it up
into shifts.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.474
I'll take the mornings.

15:09.475 --> 15:10.975
Jodie, you take the afternoons,

15:10.976 --> 15:12.978
and Burt, you take
the night shift.

15:15.481 --> 15:17.482
I really appreciate this.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.483
Come on, Jodie.

15:18.484 --> 15:19.985
Okay.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.489
All night...

15:24.490 --> 15:27.992
by myself in a cemetery.

15:27.993 --> 15:30.995
I hate cemeteries.

15:30.996 --> 15:33.498
Ha ha ha ha ha.

15:42.007 --> 15:43.008
Yes?

15:48.514 --> 15:49.514
Hello.

15:49.515 --> 15:50.515
Hello.

15:50.516 --> 15:51.516
May I come in?

15:51.517 --> 15:52.517
Of course.

15:52.518 --> 15:55.019
Oh, thank you.

15:55.020 --> 15:58.523
Oh, what little desks.

15:58.524 --> 16:02.026
Oh, when I was in school,
desks were much bigger,

16:02.027 --> 16:04.028
but of course,
then, I was much smaller,

16:04.029 --> 16:06.030
which is probably why
the desks were much bigger,

16:06.031 --> 16:08.032
so just forget I said that.

16:08.033 --> 16:10.035
All right.

16:14.540 --> 16:15.540
May I help you?

16:15.541 --> 16:16.541
No, thank you.

16:16.542 --> 16:17.542
I'll just wait.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.043
Who are you waiting for?

16:19.044 --> 16:20.545
The teacher.

16:20.546 --> 16:22.047
Oh.

16:24.049 --> 16:27.051
Are you staying after school?

16:27.052 --> 16:29.053
No, I'm Mrs. Walker.

16:29.054 --> 16:31.055
You're married?

16:31.056 --> 16:32.557
Oh, my goodness.

16:32.558 --> 16:35.560
Well, I mean,
not that I should judge.

16:35.561 --> 16:38.062
In India, they get married
when they're freshmen.

16:38.063 --> 16:42.066
In India,
and occasionally Tennessee.

16:42.067 --> 16:44.069
No, I mean, I'm the teacher.

16:45.571 --> 16:48.072
Oh.

16:48.073 --> 16:50.074
Oh my...

16:50.075 --> 16:52.076
and you're married?

16:52.077 --> 16:54.078
Divorced. Who are you?

16:54.079 --> 16:57.081
I'm Jessica Tate,
Billy's mother.

16:57.082 --> 16:59.083
Oh.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.586
Oh, my.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.588
You see, I thought
it would be nice

17:03.589 --> 17:06.089
if we finally met one another.

17:06.090 --> 17:09.093
It's, uh, very nice to meet you.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.095
Well, it's very nice
to meet you too.

17:11.096 --> 17:13.098
You certainly don't look
like a teacher.

17:14.098 --> 17:15.599
What are you thinking?

17:15.601 --> 17:18.603
I was thinking about
what you must be thinking.

17:18.604 --> 17:20.605
Well, I don't know
what I'm thinking,

17:20.606 --> 17:24.108
so I have no idea
what you think I'm thinking.

17:24.108 --> 17:27.111
I think you're thinking
that I must be a little weird.

17:27.112 --> 17:28.112
Yes.

17:28.113 --> 17:30.615
Well, because...

17:30.616 --> 17:33.117
Billy's a student,
and I'm his teacher,

17:33.118 --> 17:35.620
and he is younger,
and I'm older...

17:35.621 --> 17:38.122
That had occurred to me.

17:38.123 --> 17:41.125
I do care about him,
Mrs. Tate.

17:41.126 --> 17:42.627
He's very special.

17:42.628 --> 17:43.628
I know...

17:43.629 --> 17:45.129
and sensitive,

17:45.130 --> 17:48.132
and I just don't want Billy
to be hurt.

17:48.133 --> 17:49.133
I mean,

17:49.134 --> 17:51.135
suppose some good-looking
hygiene teacher

17:51.136 --> 17:53.638
started hanging around you.

17:53.639 --> 17:55.640
I mean, not that I think
you're flighty or anything,

17:55.641 --> 17:59.143
but you do see my point.

17:59.144 --> 18:00.144
Well, yes,

18:00.145 --> 18:02.647
but what if Billy
falls for some cheerleader?

18:02.648 --> 18:04.148
Then who gets hurt?

18:04.149 --> 18:06.150
You see, I could be hurt
just as easily.

18:06.151 --> 18:10.655
Well, I guess maybe
we should just lay back

18:10.656 --> 18:12.658
and see what happens.

18:16.161 --> 18:19.163
Actually, I should do
the laying back,

18:19.164 --> 18:21.165
and you should just do
the seeing.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.668
It's a deal.

18:23.669 --> 18:26.671
Well, I guess
I'd better be going now.

18:26.672 --> 18:28.172
Oh, me too.

18:28.173 --> 18:29.674
I've got a meeting
with the history department

18:29.675 --> 18:31.676
in five minutes.

18:31.677 --> 18:34.178
So I'll just go.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.680
Okay.

18:38.684 --> 18:40.184
Yes?

18:40.185 --> 18:42.687
May I be excused?

18:44.690 --> 18:46.190
Yes, I'm sorry.

18:46.191 --> 18:48.693
Thank you.

18:48.694 --> 18:51.697
Oh, bye-bye.

18:59.705 --> 19:01.205
Wow, I don't know what to say.

19:01.206 --> 19:02.206
This is beautiful.

19:02.207 --> 19:04.208
Yeah, Bob picked it out.

19:04.209 --> 19:06.210
Well, it's terrific.

19:06.211 --> 19:09.714
Ducks go, "quack,"
and cows go, "moo,"

19:09.715 --> 19:12.216
and dogs go, "woof,"
and I wuve you,

19:12.217 --> 19:15.219
little Wendy-Wendy-
Wendy-Wendy.

19:15.220 --> 19:16.721
Ooh, ooh.

19:16.722 --> 19:18.723
Chuck, I have never
seen him like this.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.224
I didn't know there was
someone he actually liked.

19:20.225 --> 19:21.726
Oh, I love babies.

19:21.727 --> 19:23.728
They're short.

19:23.729 --> 19:24.729
Soon as they can talk back,

19:24.730 --> 19:26.230
I can't stand them.

19:26.231 --> 19:29.233
Chicks go "cluck,"
and cats go "meow,"

19:29.234 --> 19:32.737
and do I love you?
Wow, and how,

19:32.738 --> 19:35.740
little Wendy-Wendy-
Wendy-Wendy.

19:36.742 --> 19:37.742
Hey, listen, Jodie,

19:37.743 --> 19:38.743
if you ever need a babysitter,

19:38.744 --> 19:39.744
I'm available.

19:39.745 --> 19:41.245
Hey.

19:41.246 --> 19:43.247
Hey, that's... not
such a good idea.

19:43.248 --> 19:44.749
Oh, no, he's really
very good, actually.

19:44.750 --> 19:45.750
Oh, I'm sure he is.

19:45.751 --> 19:47.251
Listen, Jodie,

19:47.252 --> 19:48.753
I know that you're
a worried new father,

19:48.754 --> 19:49.754
but it's no big thing.

19:49.755 --> 19:52.256
I mean, just call
every half-hour or so.

19:52.257 --> 19:54.258
And he'd answer the phone?

19:54.259 --> 19:56.260
Unless I'm changing the baby.

19:56.261 --> 19:58.262
Well, I'll think about it, okay?

19:58.263 --> 20:00.264
Why don't you wash up
and we'll have lunch?

20:00.265 --> 20:01.766
Okay, I'll be out in a second.

20:01.767 --> 20:02.767
I'll go with you.

20:02.768 --> 20:03.768
Hey, what is it with you?

20:03.769 --> 20:05.269
Can't I ever go
by myself? Bob.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.771
What, do you think
I can't handle it

20:06.772 --> 20:07.773
or something?

20:13.779 --> 20:14.779
Yes?

20:14.780 --> 20:16.280
Mr. Dallas?
Yes.

20:16.281 --> 20:17.281
I'm Harlen Wisser.

20:17.282 --> 20:18.282
Yes?

20:18.283 --> 20:19.283
From the Child
Welfare Department.

20:19.284 --> 20:20.284
Yeah?

20:20.285 --> 20:21.285
May I come in?

20:21.286 --> 20:22.787
Well, I don't know yet.

20:22.788 --> 20:23.788
What's on your mind?

20:23.789 --> 20:24.789
Well, we received a call stating

20:24.790 --> 20:26.290
that you had an infant
in your apartment.

20:26.291 --> 20:27.792
So?

20:27.793 --> 20:29.293
Well, sir, we also
received a complaint.

20:29.294 --> 20:30.294
From who?

20:30.295 --> 20:31.295
It's a little difficult

20:31.296 --> 20:33.798
to discuss in the hallway.

20:33.799 --> 20:35.300
Thank you.

20:37.803 --> 20:38.803
Hmm.

20:38.804 --> 20:40.805
Hmm? What does "hmm" mean?

20:40.806 --> 20:44.308
Someone in the area
called our offices

20:44.309 --> 20:46.811
and told us that a single
young male homosexual

20:46.812 --> 20:47.812
was keeping a baby
in this apartment.

20:47.813 --> 20:48.813
Are you he?

20:48.814 --> 20:51.315
I happen to have
a baby here, yes.

20:51.316 --> 20:52.817
Right over there,
as a matter of fact.

20:55.320 --> 20:56.320
He looks pale.

20:56.321 --> 21:00.324
He's a she, and so do you.

21:00.325 --> 21:02.326
Mr. Dallas,
please don't make this

21:02.327 --> 21:03.327
any harder than it already is.

21:03.328 --> 21:04.328
How am I making it hard?

21:04.329 --> 21:06.330
You walked in here.
I did not come to you.

21:06.331 --> 21:07.832
Are you a practicing homosexual?

21:07.833 --> 21:08.833
I don't have to practice.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.336
I'm very good at it.

21:14.339 --> 21:15.339
Where is the mother?

21:15.340 --> 21:16.340
I have no idea.

21:16.341 --> 21:17.341
Listen, who made the complaint?

21:17.342 --> 21:18.843
That's not important.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.344
Well, I'd hate
to punch the wrong nose.

21:20.345 --> 21:24.348
Oh, easily provoked to violence.

21:24.349 --> 21:27.351
Listen, you're beginning
to get on my nerves.

21:27.352 --> 21:29.353
I am the baby's father,
and I'm a good father,

21:29.354 --> 21:31.856
and you're... a very
interesting man.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.357
I'd love to go on
talking with you,

21:33.358 --> 21:34.859
but it's time to feed my child,

21:34.860 --> 21:35.860
so excuse me...

21:35.861 --> 21:37.361
Mr. Dallas,
a very serious complaint

21:37.362 --> 21:38.362
has been made against you,

21:38.363 --> 21:39.864
and if this child
is indeed in any danger,

21:39.865 --> 21:42.366
I'm afraid we are going to have
to take certain measures.

21:42.367 --> 21:44.368
Hey... my social life
and my child

21:44.369 --> 21:45.870
have nothing to do
with each other.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.872
My life <i>is</i> my child.

21:47.873 --> 21:48.873
Now, listen, I don't drink.

21:48.874 --> 21:50.875
I don't smoke.
I don't do drugs.

21:50.876 --> 21:51.876
I don't have wild parties here.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.378
I don't even like to dance.

21:54.379 --> 21:55.379
I'm a responsible parent

21:55.380 --> 21:57.381
who's trying to bring up
his little girl

21:57.382 --> 21:58.382
in the most wholesome
atmosphere possible,

21:58.383 --> 22:00.384
and the friends that I have
are equally responsible,

22:00.385 --> 22:02.887
wholesome, dependable,
sane individuals.

22:02.888 --> 22:03.888
I can't believe this.

22:03.889 --> 22:05.389
Will you look at this,
you idiot?

22:05.390 --> 22:06.390
Bob, it was a mistake.

22:06.391 --> 22:07.391
You'll dry.

22:07.392 --> 22:08.392
Oh, gee...

22:08.393 --> 22:10.895
Guys?

22:10.896 --> 22:13.398
Jodie, he washed his hands.

22:15.400 --> 22:16.400
Well, you're supposed

22:16.401 --> 22:17.401
to wash your hands afterwards.

22:17.402 --> 22:18.402
Yeah, well, you're supposed

22:18.403 --> 22:20.905
to put me down first, you moron.

22:20.906 --> 22:22.907
Now it's gonna
shrink like crazy.

22:22.908 --> 22:23.908
In a half an hour,

22:23.909 --> 22:25.910
I won't even be able to breathe.

22:25.911 --> 22:27.411
Hi there.

22:27.412 --> 22:28.412
Hey, who's the limp?

22:28.413 --> 22:30.415
Is he one of your tricks?

22:33.759 --> 22:34.919
They're working on a new act.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.922
That man is arguing with a doll.

22:37.923 --> 22:38.923
Homosexuals and puppets?

22:38.924 --> 22:40.424
What kind of a place is this?

22:40.425 --> 22:41.425
Listen...

22:41.426 --> 22:42.426
this conversation is over.

22:42.427 --> 22:43.427
You're touching me, young man.

22:43.428 --> 22:44.428
Yeah, you were not invited in,

22:44.429 --> 22:48.432
and now you will be invited out.

22:48.433 --> 22:49.934
You might be
in big trouble, fella.

22:49.935 --> 22:50.935
Get out!

22:50.936 --> 22:52.436
Hey, way to go, Jodie.

22:52.437 --> 22:53.437
Yeah.

22:53.438 --> 22:55.439
I'm in big trouble, Chuck.

22:55.440 --> 22:56.440
I'm in big trouble.

22:56.441 --> 22:57.441
I shouldn't have done that.

22:57.442 --> 22:58.943
That was really dumb.

22:58.944 --> 23:00.444
Oh, come on, Jodie.

23:00.445 --> 23:02.446
I mean, what can he possibly do?

23:02.447 --> 23:04.448
They can't take Wendy
away from me.

23:04.449 --> 23:05.950
I'll get character references.

23:05.951 --> 23:06.951
Hey, hey, no problem.

23:06.952 --> 23:08.452
Yeah, you got Danny.

23:08.453 --> 23:09.954
Don't forget Burt and Mary.

23:09.955 --> 23:11.455
Yeah, and Uncle Chester.

23:11.456 --> 23:12.957
Aunt Jessica.

23:12.958 --> 23:13.958
Chuck.
Bob.

23:13.959 --> 23:14.959
Dutch and Eunice...

23:14.960 --> 23:15.960
Corinne.

23:15.961 --> 23:17.461
And don't forget the Major.

23:17.462 --> 23:20.465
I'm in big trouble.

23:30.475 --> 23:32.977
ANNOUNCER:
<i>Is Burt's insomnia really space lag,</i>

23:32.978 --> 23:34.979
<i>or has he just been</i>
<i>making up for lost time?</i>

23:34.980 --> 23:36.981
<i>Now that Jessica has met Leslie,</i>

23:36.982 --> 23:38.983
<i>does "teacher's pet"</i>
<i>have new meaning?</i>

23:38.984 --> 23:40.484
<i>Will Danny find Polly,</i>

23:40.485 --> 23:41.986
<i>and if he does, what will he do?</i>

23:41.987 --> 23:43.988
<i>Now that Jessica</i>
<i>has caught Chester</i>

23:43.989 --> 23:45.489
<i>and told him he can't come home,</i>

23:45.490 --> 23:46.490
<i>what will he do?</i>

23:46.491 --> 23:47.992
<i>How will he change</i>
<i>his underwear?</i>

23:47.993 --> 23:49.493
<i>These questions and many others</i>

23:49.494 --> 23:52.997
<i>will be answered</i>
<i>in the next episode of</i> Soap.

23:57.002 --> 24:00.004
