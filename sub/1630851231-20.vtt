WEBVTT

00:15.383 --> 00:17.118
- Hey.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.619
Sorry about all the confusion.

00:18.686 --> 00:21.155
I didn't want to say too
much on the phone, you know?

00:21.222 --> 00:23.491
- That's always a good idea.

00:23.557 --> 00:25.093
- So, what's up, my friend?

00:25.159 --> 00:26.760
What are we doing here?

00:26.827 --> 00:28.996
- My boss is getting
suspicious, which,

00:29.063 --> 00:31.599
of course,
is making me nervous, so...

00:31.665 --> 00:33.401
I think it's best
if I step aside.

00:33.467 --> 00:35.369
Before something bad happens.

00:35.436 --> 00:37.171
- But we already paid you.

00:37.238 --> 00:38.772
- I know.
I'll give the money back.

00:38.839 --> 00:40.341
No problem.

00:40.408 --> 00:41.542
I need a few days,
though, I--

00:41.609 --> 00:43.577
I have to sell my car.

00:43.644 --> 00:46.147
- Sure, that's your call.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.668
Hey, thanks
for getting over here so fast.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.037
- What do we got?
- DOA, Cher Wilkins.

01:10.104 --> 01:11.905
Female, white, 32.

01:11.972 --> 01:14.007
Recovered her wallet, and her
keys are still in the ignition,

01:14.074 --> 01:15.609
so I'm guessing
it wasn't a robbery.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.511
Three shots to the back.

01:17.578 --> 01:18.912
- Find any casings?

01:18.979 --> 01:21.014
- Naw, the killer--
or more likely the killers,

01:21.081 --> 01:22.950
they policed up their brass.

01:23.016 --> 01:24.985
- What makes you think
that there was more than one?

01:25.052 --> 01:27.988
- Two sets of tracks
right next to the body.

01:28.055 --> 01:29.390
- Huh.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.891
Well, looks like
after they shot her,

01:30.958 --> 01:33.461
they got close enough
to make sure that she was dead.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.996
It's not really much to go on,

01:36.063 --> 01:38.766
but I'll send them over
to ERT for analysis.

01:38.832 --> 01:40.768
- In case you need me.
- Yeah.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.736
Still in her uniform.

01:47.575 --> 01:50.411
- Cher was a good kid,
but if I'm being honest,

01:50.478 --> 01:52.480
I was getting
a little suspicious of her.

01:52.546 --> 01:54.982
- Suspicious of what?
- She was always broke.

01:55.048 --> 01:57.185
Then a few days ago,
she rolls up

01:57.251 --> 01:58.652
in a brand-new Mustang.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.222
Said her father just died,
came into money.

02:01.289 --> 02:03.924
- You weren't buying it?
- No, not for a second.

02:03.991 --> 02:07.328
Whenever some broke employee
starts flashing lots of cash,

02:07.395 --> 02:08.962
it always means the same thing.

02:09.029 --> 02:11.932
They're waving drug mules
through the security line.

02:14.001 --> 02:15.636
- All right,
so Cher Wilkins, 32,

02:15.703 --> 02:17.605
single, no kids,
lived in Queens.

02:17.671 --> 02:19.907
Been working for TSA
for the last three years.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.109
What else do we know?
- Background check is clean.

02:22.176 --> 02:24.412
No priors,
not even a jaywalking ticket.

02:24.478 --> 02:25.713
- Mm-hmm.
What about her family?

02:25.779 --> 02:26.980
Supervisor said her
dad died recently,

02:27.047 --> 02:28.716
left her some dough.
Is that true?

02:28.782 --> 02:30.284
- Last known address
for her father

02:30.351 --> 02:32.119
is Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

02:32.186 --> 02:33.721
And he's very much alive--
he posted about

02:33.787 --> 02:35.356
his daughter's murder
12 minutes ago.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.890
- Okay, so the supervisor
was right.

02:36.957 --> 02:40.027
She was lying about where
she got the money for that car.

02:40.093 --> 02:42.263
- Used Mustang was purchased
four days ago with cash.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.765
$46,345 to be exact.

02:44.832 --> 02:47.668
- Huh, that is a lot of
cheddar for a TSA agent

02:47.735 --> 02:49.270
to be throwing around.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.272
So maybe
the supervisor was right.

02:51.339 --> 02:53.841
Kid got caught up
in the drug game.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.943
How are we doing
with the vehicle's GPS?

02:56.009 --> 02:58.312
Need to find out where Wilkins
spent time the last few days.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.315
- Besides going to work
and the industrial park

03:01.382 --> 03:04.685
where she was killed,
the only other place she went to

03:04.752 --> 03:06.854
was this restaurant in Queens.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.056
Sumac House,
it's a Mediterranean joint.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.692
- There's nothing suspicious
about liking Mediterranean food.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.394
- Yeah, but she went there

03:13.461 --> 03:14.962
three times
on the day of the murder

03:15.028 --> 03:17.665
and four other times
over the past three days.

03:17.731 --> 03:20.000
No one likes
Mediterranean food that much.

03:20.067 --> 03:21.335
- So maybe this
restaurant is a front

03:21.402 --> 03:23.170
for a drug
trafficking ring, huh?

03:23.237 --> 03:24.638
All right, throw it up.

03:24.705 --> 03:26.374
Start digging
the financials, permits.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.108
All right eyes up,
party people.

03:28.175 --> 03:31.144
Anyone got anything on this
Mediterranean joint in Queens

03:31.211 --> 03:32.580
called Sumac House?

03:32.646 --> 03:34.248
Don't be shy.

03:34.315 --> 03:37.017
Hey Elise,
call Nina and OA,

03:37.084 --> 03:39.720
tell them to cancel
their lunch plans.

03:52.866 --> 03:54.368
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:54.435 --> 03:55.669
- Thanks for picking me up.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.037
- Sure thing.

03:58.539 --> 03:59.740
Those your friends?

03:59.807 --> 04:01.542
- Ex-teammates.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.677
We were deployed
together in Afghanistan.

04:16.624 --> 04:17.958
- This looks good.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.228
Thank you.

04:21.295 --> 04:23.664
It looks like Lebanese food,

04:23.731 --> 04:26.166
or Egyptian, I'm guessing.

04:26.233 --> 04:28.101
- The menu seemed to have
a little bit of everything,

04:28.168 --> 04:29.570
so I tried
to take it easy on you.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.772
- Well thank you.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.077
So, the, uh...

04:39.580 --> 04:41.014
guy at the bar,

04:41.081 --> 04:43.183
according to the JOC,
is the owner.

04:44.752 --> 04:47.187
- He seems on edge.

04:47.254 --> 04:50.190
And they have
security cameras everywhere.

04:50.257 --> 04:51.559
- Mm.

04:57.798 --> 04:59.967
Wanna tell me the story
behind the string?

05:02.002 --> 05:04.672
- Today is the 10th anniversary
of my friend's death.

05:04.738 --> 05:06.340
He died in Afghanistan.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.409
His name is Tom.
Tom Keller.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.177
- I'm so sorry.

05:10.243 --> 05:12.045
- So once a year,
me and a few army buddies,

05:12.112 --> 05:14.382
we get together,
we go to the cemetery,

05:14.448 --> 05:17.117
pay our respects,
and then we grab breakfast,

05:17.184 --> 05:20.688
and we tie a string
around our finger

05:20.754 --> 05:24.057
as a way to make sure
that we never forget.

05:26.894 --> 05:28.195
- To Tom, then.

05:36.236 --> 05:37.471
Something up?

05:37.538 --> 05:38.939
- Just looks like...

05:39.006 --> 05:41.341
someone I used to know.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.314
- Guessing you weren't
a big fan of this person.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.083
- Um...

05:50.150 --> 05:51.118
I wasn't.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.895
I'll be right back.

06:30.123 --> 06:31.659
- Hey.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.126
What was that about?

06:33.193 --> 06:35.395
- I was just following a hunch.

06:35.463 --> 06:37.130
I need to get a closer look.

06:37.197 --> 06:39.967
I think he got nervous
and ran out the back door.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.702
- Look, I don't want to pry,
but now that

06:41.769 --> 06:43.136
you're following
people into bathrooms,

06:43.203 --> 06:45.338
I need to ask you
what the hell is going on?

06:45.405 --> 06:47.140
- The guy in that
restaurant resembled a man

06:47.207 --> 06:49.443
named Tamir Hazara.
They called him "the rat."

06:49.510 --> 06:51.311
He's a high-level target
of ours from Afghanistan,

06:51.378 --> 06:54.181
and my squad spent
about 14 months pursuing him.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.550
- And you think he's here
in New York now?

06:56.617 --> 07:00.854
What, that he's somehow a part
of the TSA agent's murder?

07:00.921 --> 07:02.690
- I don't know, but I had
this feeling in my gut

07:02.756 --> 07:05.358
that it was him,
that it was Tamir.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.227
It had to be him.

07:07.294 --> 07:09.863
- Okay, or maybe it was
just some patron

07:09.930 --> 07:12.032
who was dining and dashing--
Look, I--

07:12.099 --> 07:15.135
- I know what I saw.
I know what I felt.

07:17.738 --> 07:19.106
I know what I felt.

07:29.717 --> 07:33.286
- Tamir Hazara.

07:33.353 --> 07:35.723
- Okay, I see
the resemblance, but I...

07:35.789 --> 07:37.691
- He could've had plastic
surgery, changed his features.

07:37.758 --> 07:39.059
It's the best way to avoid

07:39.126 --> 07:41.161
all the facial recognition
software out there.

07:41.228 --> 07:42.730
- Dude, that's a good plan,

07:42.796 --> 07:44.197
but Tamir is dead.

07:44.264 --> 07:46.199
He was killed
in a drone strike

07:46.266 --> 07:47.735
three years ago outside
of Kabul.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.503
- Yeah, it's possible, but...

07:49.570 --> 07:51.004
- Possible?

07:51.071 --> 07:52.372
- Yeah, the State
Department records

07:52.439 --> 07:53.707
aren't exactly foolproof.

07:53.774 --> 07:55.743
I have a friend in Intel.
I'll reach out to him.

07:55.809 --> 07:57.110
- Hey, who's this?

07:57.177 --> 07:59.980
- Someone OA was chasing
over in Afghanistan.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.949
- Connected
to the current case?

08:02.015 --> 08:04.852
- Well, he's dead.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.554
- Okay.

08:06.620 --> 08:07.888
Can you talk?

08:07.955 --> 08:11.324
- Yeah. What's up?

08:11.391 --> 08:14.161
- Well, just between us,
I think that OA

08:14.227 --> 08:16.229
might be struggling
a little bit right now.

08:16.296 --> 08:17.397
- Oh, really.

08:17.464 --> 08:19.667
Because of
the sarin gas exposure.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.068
- No, uh...

08:21.134 --> 08:22.502
today, when we were
doing recon

08:22.570 --> 08:24.572
at the Mediterranean restaurant
he shared with me

08:24.638 --> 08:27.541
that it was the anniversary
of his army buddy's death.

08:27.608 --> 08:30.911
Not sure how he died,
but it seemed pretty traumatic.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.780
- I know
this partnership is new.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.147
You want me to talk to him?
- No.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.983
No, no, no. I got it.

08:36.049 --> 08:39.219
You know, he's strong
and focused.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.623
I just felt
like you should know.

08:42.690 --> 08:43.891
- Yeah.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.859
Okay, good.
I'll keep an eye on it.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.094
So, did you find
anything interesting

08:47.160 --> 08:49.262
at the restaurant?
- No, not really.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.431
- We got techs putting up
pole cams outside just in case,

08:51.498 --> 08:53.233
but we searched
the victim's apartment,

08:53.300 --> 08:55.168
found 10 grand in cash
and a laptop.

08:55.235 --> 08:56.469
Ian's scrubbing
it for evidence now.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.539
So maybe we'll get lucky.
- Finger's crossed.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.877
- All right.
Found a few encrypted messages

09:03.944 --> 09:06.246
from a guy calling
himself "BALLER22."

09:06.313 --> 09:08.248
It looks like
he sent our victim 50K

09:08.315 --> 09:09.883
to wave a man
in a red puffer jacket

09:09.950 --> 09:11.251
through airport
security yesterday.

09:11.318 --> 09:13.821
- Okay, so the supervisor's
hunch was correct.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.455
Wilkins was playing ball.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.325
- And I found a message from
Wilkins to that same person.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.794
"Got a problem.
Boss is suspicious.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.029
Need to discuss."

09:22.095 --> 09:23.964
BALLER22 responds,

09:24.031 --> 09:26.299
"Okay, let's meet
where we met last time."

09:26.366 --> 09:28.769
- So it looks like
ol' BALLER22 is our shooter.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.971
I mean, at the very least,
he's the one who lured Wilkins

09:31.038 --> 09:32.539
to the industrial park
that night.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.441
- Can we track
BALLER's IP address?

09:34.507 --> 09:36.944
- Negative,
he used a dozen different VPNs.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.179
No way to trace them
back to the source.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.348
- Okay, let's pull up
some airport video,

09:41.414 --> 09:43.951
see if we can ID this dude
in the red puffer jacket.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.485
- Yeah.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.555
- Okay. This is from yesterday,

09:48.622 --> 09:50.791
24 p.m.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.726
There is Wilkins.

09:53.493 --> 09:55.028
And there's the dude
with the red puffer.

09:55.095 --> 09:57.130
- Yeah, nice and easy.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.733
Wilkins waves them through,
dope goes unnoticed.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.302
- All right Elise
let's run facial rec.

10:04.171 --> 10:06.774
- Name is Jorge Cissneros.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.942
37, lives in Brooklyn.

10:09.009 --> 10:10.243
He's on probation
for a car theft

10:10.310 --> 10:12.479
but has no prior drug arrests.

10:12.545 --> 10:13.881
- All right,
let's find his last known

10:13.947 --> 10:15.248
address and bring him in.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.416
- Right.

10:20.854 --> 10:22.089
- Tiff and I
will cover the back.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.390
- Sounds good.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.861
- Hey, you ever
talk to your Intel buddy?

10:27.928 --> 10:29.897
- Yeah. It lined up
with what the Red Notice said--

10:29.963 --> 10:31.765
claims that
Tamir's DNA was recovered

10:31.832 --> 10:33.834
at the site of a drone
strike in Afghanistan.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.202
- Claims?

10:35.268 --> 10:37.070
- I'm a skeptic,
what can I say?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.571
- Yeah, I get that.
You know, at some point,

10:38.638 --> 10:40.007
you got to take "Yes"
for an answer, though.

10:40.073 --> 10:42.642
He's dead,
and that is a good thing.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.319
- FBI, open up!

10:52.385 --> 10:54.988
- Looks like no one's home.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.359
- FBI, we are looking
for a Jorge Cissneros.

11:01.361 --> 11:03.563
- Hey, no answer up front.
Any movement back there?

11:03.630 --> 11:05.165
- Negative.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.704
- Hey, check it out.
That's Cissneros.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.074
- Yup.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.812
Okay, guys, we have eyes
on Cissneros.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.914
He just crossed the street,
he's headed towards us now.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.383
Jorge!

11:30.590 --> 11:32.659
man:
- You okay?

11:44.304 --> 11:45.572
- Jorge, relax.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.540
- Hey, you're coming
with us, pal.

11:58.151 --> 12:00.120
- What's up?

12:00.187 --> 12:01.654
- I'll be right back.

12:13.266 --> 12:16.003
- Excuse me--
- What the hell?

12:16.069 --> 12:18.171
- I'm sorry.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.240
I'm sorry, I thought
you were someone else.

12:23.977 --> 12:26.146
- Hey, what's going on?

12:26.213 --> 12:28.015
- I thought that was Tamir.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.217
Same build, same hair.

12:32.619 --> 12:34.087
- Who's Tamir?

12:34.154 --> 12:37.090
- He's a terrorist I saw
at the restaurant today.

12:37.157 --> 12:39.559
- A guy he thought was Tamir.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.229
- No, it was him.

12:47.868 --> 12:50.537
- So we've got video of Wilkins
waving you through security.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.641
- So?

12:54.707 --> 12:56.676
- So Wilkins is dead.

12:56.743 --> 12:58.245
- And we know that she was
working with drug traffickers,

12:58.311 --> 12:59.980
so you can drop this
babe in the woods routine.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.349
We're not buying it.

13:02.415 --> 13:05.518
- Look, I'm on probation.
I don't want to get violated.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.320
- If you cooperate,
we'll see what we can do.

13:09.756 --> 13:11.959
- And if you don't, we will take
you back down to probation,

13:12.025 --> 13:14.461
which means you will
go back to jail.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.563
- You know, the good news is
that by the time you get out,

13:16.629 --> 13:18.498
we'll be ready to
indict you on federal drug

13:18.565 --> 13:21.301
trafficking charges,
so you have that going for you.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.839
- All I know is
is that some guy paid me

13:25.906 --> 13:28.909
to take a backpack of dope
to Chicago the other day.

13:28.976 --> 13:30.978
It was heroin, I think.

13:31.044 --> 13:32.545
- What do you mean,
"You think"?

13:32.612 --> 13:35.515
- He said it was, but I didn't
look--the bag was zip tied.

13:35.582 --> 13:37.550
It wasn't an option.
- What'd you do with

13:37.617 --> 13:38.986
the backpack
once you got to Chicago?

13:39.052 --> 13:41.521
- I dropped it in the trashcan
outside the airport.

13:41.588 --> 13:43.390
- Who's this guy that
paid you to do the drop?

13:43.456 --> 13:45.358
- Some guy
I met at a restaurant.

13:45.425 --> 13:47.594
He started talking,
and one thing led to another.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.096
- Restaurant
called Sumac House?

13:49.162 --> 13:51.498
- Yeah. How'd you know?

13:53.233 --> 13:55.335
- Is that him?
- Yeah, that's him.

13:55.402 --> 13:56.803
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

13:56.870 --> 13:58.305
But he promised me 5 grand

13:58.371 --> 13:59.839
and said I had no chance
of getting busted,

13:59.907 --> 14:01.841
because they had
a TSA chick in their pocket.

14:01.909 --> 14:03.776
- How many runs have you made?
- One.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.578
I swear.
I haven't even been paid yet.

14:05.645 --> 14:07.347
I'm supposed
to meet that dude tomorrow

14:07.414 --> 14:09.382
at the restaurant
to collect my cash.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.356
- Jem Polat, born in Istanbul,

14:16.423 --> 14:18.591
but spent most of his
teenage years in Syria.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.193
He came to the US
two years ago.

14:20.260 --> 14:21.929
He's here on a temporary visa.

14:21.995 --> 14:24.864
Financial records show that he
opened the restaurant last year.

14:24.932 --> 14:27.467
- No criminal record
or Interpol flags, either.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.536
- All right,
so Polat is a drug dealer,

14:29.602 --> 14:31.771
has a TSA agent in his pocket.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.306
Day before she gets shot,

14:33.373 --> 14:35.075
she tells somebody
she's got a problem,

14:35.142 --> 14:36.910
and her boss gets suspicious.

14:36.977 --> 14:38.345
- And she meets with BALLER22

14:38.411 --> 14:40.013
and tells him about her
suspicious supervisor.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.582
- And then BALLER22 shoots
her three times in the back.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.616
- Right.

14:43.683 --> 14:46.286
- Question is,
who is BALLER22?

14:46.353 --> 14:48.221
- I'm guessing it's Polat.

14:48.288 --> 14:49.389
- Right. It makes sense.

14:49.456 --> 14:51.324
But now we need to prove it.

14:51.391 --> 14:53.460
- Copy that.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.599
- You just show up
like nothing happened, okay?

14:59.666 --> 15:01.768
Business as usual--you are
there to collect your cash

15:01.834 --> 15:03.136
and get on with your day.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.372
- Try and get him
to say something incriminating.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.942
- Okay, cool. I'll just try
and get him to talk.

15:09.009 --> 15:10.510
- But don't push too hard.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.845
'Cause he'll smell it
from a mile away.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.914
- Nina.

15:14.982 --> 15:16.216
- I'll be right back.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.523
- Okay, look,
I know that it seems unlikely,

15:23.590 --> 15:25.558
but if the guy that I saw
near Cissneros' place

15:25.625 --> 15:27.794
really was Tamir,
then Polat is going to know

15:27.860 --> 15:29.829
that he was arrested
and that he's wearing a wire.

15:29.896 --> 15:30.998
- You grabbed the guy.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.465
It wasn't him.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.434
- I know, I know, but--
- Look, you told me

15:34.501 --> 15:35.802
that Tamir
was a terrorist, right?

15:35.868 --> 15:38.305
Not a drug dealer.
So why would he be involved

15:38.371 --> 15:40.007
with Cissneros or Polat?

15:40.073 --> 15:41.508
- I don't know.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.576
But for some reason I--
- OA, you confirmed

15:43.643 --> 15:45.145
with your army buddy
that Tamir was dead.

15:45.212 --> 15:47.780
They found his DNA at
the site of the drone strike.

15:50.850 --> 15:53.053
- It was him
at the restaurant, Nina.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.422
It was Tamir.

15:56.756 --> 15:58.591
Okay? It's been years,
his face has changed,

15:58.658 --> 16:01.394
he could have had surgery,
but I remember his eyes.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.739
Do you know who this is?

16:12.805 --> 16:15.175
You've never seen him before?

16:15.242 --> 16:16.643
- No.
- We know that Polat

16:16.709 --> 16:18.878
has a partner, and we think
that it is this guy.

16:18.945 --> 16:20.547
His name is Tamir Hazara.

16:20.613 --> 16:22.249
You've never seen him at the
restaurant, near your place,

16:22.315 --> 16:24.517
with Polat, anything?
- No, never.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.086
- Don't lie to me Jorge.
- I'm not.

16:26.153 --> 16:28.521
I've never seen him.
- I am trying to help you, bro.

16:28.588 --> 16:29.789
Because if Tamir
knows that you were involved,

16:29.856 --> 16:30.857
he's going to know
you're wearing a wire.

16:30.923 --> 16:31.891
Do you understand
what I'm saying--

16:31.958 --> 16:33.460
- OA.

16:38.265 --> 16:39.332
- I'm sorry.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.334
Let's do it.

16:42.402 --> 16:44.804
- Come on, let's go.

16:54.581 --> 16:58.251
- Remember, money first so
that he doesn't get suspicious.

16:58.318 --> 16:59.819
- Got it.

17:01.121 --> 17:02.722
- And at some point,
not right away,

17:02.789 --> 17:04.691
make sure to ask
about the partner.

17:07.460 --> 17:09.662
There were two sets of
footprints at the crime scene.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.231
If Polat didn't
pull the trigger,

17:11.298 --> 17:12.932
means the other guy
probably did.

17:12.999 --> 17:14.801
- Yeah, I get that, but
I don't want to confuse him.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.002
He says one wrong thing
in there

17:16.069 --> 17:17.637
and Polat's going to
shut him down.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.139
- Yeah.

17:21.974 --> 17:24.111
- Sit, order something.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.445
You never know who's watching.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.847
- Just bring me whatever.
I just wanna get paid.

17:27.914 --> 17:29.849
- Take the damn menu.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.718
Those cameras aren't for show.

17:31.784 --> 17:33.086
If a cop reviews them,

17:33.153 --> 17:37.090
this needs to look like
a normal interaction.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.660
- Chicken kebab.
- Hmm.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.028
Perfect.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.664
Did you drop off the package?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.099
In Chicago, like I said?

17:46.166 --> 17:47.734
- Yeah, in the trash can.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.202
Just like you said.

17:49.269 --> 17:51.404
Your guy on that side
didn't get it?

17:51.471 --> 17:53.373
- No.

17:53.440 --> 17:56.209
Because the package was empty.

17:56.276 --> 17:57.477
- What?

17:57.544 --> 18:01.248
- We needed to make sure
we could trust you.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.716
- He said "We."
Press for the partner's name.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.385
- Who's we?

18:05.452 --> 18:07.154
- My partner.

18:08.288 --> 18:10.223
- Where's he at?

18:10.290 --> 18:12.425
- Doesn't matter.
Doesn't concern you.

18:12.492 --> 18:14.561
- Of course it concerns me.

18:14.627 --> 18:15.895
I'd like to know
who I'm working for.

18:15.962 --> 18:18.431
Trust is a two-way street.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.800
Here.

18:20.867 --> 18:23.803
Take the money, eat the kebab,

18:23.870 --> 18:26.573
and stop asking
so many questions.

18:27.039 --> 18:29.041
- Yeah careful.
Don't push too hard.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.885
- I have another job
for you if you're interested.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.453
- Yeah, sure.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.556
When is it?

18:43.623 --> 18:45.192
- This afternoon.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.761
Same routine, same destination.

18:48.828 --> 18:51.030
- The TSA girl
who waved me through,

18:51.097 --> 18:53.333
she got shot--
I saw her on the news.

18:53.400 --> 18:56.203
- It doesn't matter.
We have a new guy.

18:57.604 --> 19:00.106
Meet me here,30.

19:00.173 --> 19:03.543
I will have a plane ticket
and a backpack waiting for you.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.912
Look...

19:05.978 --> 19:07.947
I'm not a drug dealer.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.217
I'm just trying to
make some easy money.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.652
So I just wanna be sure
that I'm not going to get

19:12.719 --> 19:14.687
busted going
through that security.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.289
- I told you...

19:16.356 --> 19:17.990
it's all set.

19:18.057 --> 19:21.127
- I don't wanna end up
with a bullet in my head.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.997
- As long as you do
what we ask...

19:25.064 --> 19:28.235
you don't need to worry.

19:33.273 --> 19:34.974
- Tell him that you
want to meet his partner.

19:35.041 --> 19:38.545
Look him in the eye.
Get a read on him.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.713
- I trust you...

19:40.780 --> 19:43.616
because I can see you,
because I can read your eyes.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.452
If it's possible,

19:45.518 --> 19:47.654
I'd like to do the same
with your partner.

19:47.720 --> 19:49.055
Look into his eyes, and--

19:49.121 --> 19:51.291
and be sure
that I can trust him.

19:53.726 --> 19:56.729
- You don't want
to meet my partner.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.965
Trust me on that, Jorge.

20:03.670 --> 20:05.204
Are you in or out?

20:09.342 --> 20:12.412
- Agree and get
the hell out of there.

20:12.479 --> 20:13.880
- I'm good.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.715
I'll be back in a few hours.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.422
- Polat seemed to acknowledge
he had something to do

20:22.489 --> 20:25.392
with the TSA agent's death,
but he didn't quite confess.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.093
- Seemed to?

20:27.159 --> 20:28.695
- Cissneros was expressing
his concern

20:28.761 --> 20:31.063
about the TSA agent's murder,
said he didn't want to wind up

20:31.130 --> 20:33.366
with a bullet in his head,
to which Polat responded,

20:33.433 --> 20:35.234
"If you do what we ask,
you'll be okay."

20:35.302 --> 20:37.837
- It's not exactly a denial.
- You're right.

20:37.904 --> 20:40.172
But not enough for arrest
or a warrant.

20:40.239 --> 20:41.374
- Mm-mm.

20:41.441 --> 20:43.109
All right,
here's what we do.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.077
Have Cissneros agree
to the new drug run,

20:45.144 --> 20:47.680
follow him through the TSA line
and into the terminal.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.516
- Wait--but what
does that get us?

20:49.582 --> 20:51.684
- The identity of the new
TSA agent on Polat's payroll.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.953
- Right, we arrest him.
Get him to cooperate.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.955
Maybe he knows something
about the murder.

20:56.022 --> 20:56.956
- Yep.
- All right.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.025
- Good luck.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.793
- It's sealed with a zip tie.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.462
If the client in Chicago

21:02.529 --> 21:04.731
sees that you've opened it,
you get nothing.

21:04.797 --> 21:07.066
Understand?
- Not a problem.

21:07.133 --> 21:08.701
Don't want to know
what's in it anyway.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.304
Means I can pass a polygraph
test in case I get busted.

21:11.371 --> 21:12.739
- You're not going
to get busted.

21:12.805 --> 21:15.241
The new TSA agent will see you
in that red jacket

21:15.308 --> 21:16.909
and wave you through the line.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.345
Your flight
leaves in three hours.

21:18.411 --> 21:20.079
Get there early.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.281
Don't miss it.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.595
- JFK.

21:35.662 --> 21:36.863
- You got it.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.017
Let's see what
we're dealing with.

22:10.797 --> 22:12.599
- Oh, damn.

22:12.665 --> 22:15.067
- "Oh, damn" is right.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.303
I'm gonna back away slowly.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.476
We got a situation.

22:23.543 --> 22:25.211
It's not drugs.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.614
This backpack
has a bomb inside it.

22:33.686 --> 22:36.222
- Six blocks of Semtex
with a barometric trigger

22:36.288 --> 22:38.725
connected to
a 7.4-volt battery.

22:38.791 --> 22:41.160
Packed with bearings
for maximum damage.

22:41.227 --> 22:42.429
- The trigger
was set to go off

22:42.495 --> 22:43.796
when the plane hit
a certain altitude.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.865
- We are definitely
dealing with a terrorist.

22:45.932 --> 22:47.867
- Look, guys, I know that he
is supposed to be dead and all,

22:47.934 --> 22:51.003
but Tamir used Semtex initiated
with 7.4-volt batteries

22:51.070 --> 22:53.440
all the time in Afghanistan.

22:56.843 --> 22:58.210
- I'll call the JOC.

22:58.277 --> 23:01.313
Update Isobel and Jubal,
see how they want to play it.

23:05.852 --> 23:07.053
- FBI.

23:07.119 --> 23:08.488
- Everybody stay calm

23:08.555 --> 23:10.557
and keep your hands
where we can see them.

23:15.462 --> 23:17.530
- Polat, put your hands
in the air, now.

23:18.965 --> 23:21.167
- Suspect is on the move!

23:21.233 --> 23:23.369
- Polat, freeze!

23:35.381 --> 23:36.849
- Jem Polat,
hands behind your back.

23:36.916 --> 23:38.785
You're under arrest.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.589
- Suspect is in custody.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.056
- It's a 9-mill.

23:44.123 --> 23:47.393
- Could be our murder weapon.

23:52.632 --> 23:55.034
- Hey, so prints
came back on our guy.

23:55.101 --> 23:58.237
His name is not Jem Polat.
It is Abdul Al-Halil.

23:58.304 --> 23:59.672
He's Afghani.

23:59.739 --> 24:02.875
Must've assumed or bought
the real Polat's identity.

24:02.942 --> 24:05.344
The State Department Intel says
as a child, he took up arms

24:05.411 --> 24:07.914
against the Russians
in the Soviet-Afghan War.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.782
And then once they got
chased out of the country,

24:09.849 --> 24:11.884
he turned his attention
on the American troops.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.586
- And now that we're
no longer in Afghanistan,

24:13.653 --> 24:15.822
he has brought the fight to us.
- Something like that, yeah.

24:15.888 --> 24:17.490
- Explains why he'd want
to blow up a plane stateside.

24:17.557 --> 24:19.125
Makes a big statement.

24:19.191 --> 24:21.594
- Do the Intel agencies
have a list of associates?

24:21.661 --> 24:23.896
- Yes, and Tamir Hazara
is not one of them.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.765
They also made it clear
that he is dead.

24:25.832 --> 24:28.267
- I get it, but Intel
is not a perfect science.

24:31.871 --> 24:34.140
- Well, State Department
and CIA

24:34.206 --> 24:36.175
have both reconfirmed
his death,

24:36.242 --> 24:38.044
so they may not be perfect,

24:38.110 --> 24:42.314
but we are going to proceed
as if the Intel is correct.

24:44.951 --> 24:46.385
Okay?

24:48.521 --> 24:50.823
- Either way,
Polat has a partner out there,

24:50.890 --> 24:52.725
who was most likely involved
in the shooting

24:52.792 --> 24:55.261
and the attempted bombing,
so...

24:55.327 --> 24:56.896
we should
probably find that guy.

24:58.497 --> 25:00.933
Agreed.
So go talk to our new guest.

25:01.000 --> 25:02.669
Get some answers.

25:06.873 --> 25:09.341
- How many more bombs
are there?

25:09.408 --> 25:12.244
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:12.311 --> 25:13.980
- You're already
looking at life in prison

25:14.046 --> 25:15.648
if you do not cooperate.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.149
So you might as well talk.

25:17.216 --> 25:19.552
You can get your anti-American
talking points on record.

25:19.619 --> 25:21.487
- I don't have talking points.

25:21.554 --> 25:23.322
I love America.

25:23.389 --> 25:24.791
Who doesn't?

25:24.857 --> 25:27.493
- Please don't
play stupid, okay?

25:29.228 --> 25:31.664
The time for games is over.
We know that you are Afghani

25:31.731 --> 25:33.566
and that your name is Al-Halil.

25:33.633 --> 25:34.867
- We scrubbed the laptop
we found

25:34.934 --> 25:36.368
in your restaurant's
back office.

25:36.435 --> 25:39.906
We found the text
between you and Wilkins.

25:39.972 --> 25:42.541
- Then make your case
and leave me alone.

25:48.347 --> 25:49.982
- Who killed Wilkins, you?

25:50.049 --> 25:52.051
- I own a restaurant.
I'm not a killer.

25:52.118 --> 25:54.386
- So your partner shot her.
That's what you're saying.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.222
- I don't have a partner.

25:56.288 --> 25:57.757
- Sure you do.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.391
We found two sets of footprints

25:59.458 --> 26:01.861
at the murder scene,
one belonging to you...

26:01.928 --> 26:04.664
and the other belonging
to your partner.

26:06.198 --> 26:07.466
- Tamir Hazara.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.538
I don't know anyone
by that name.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.774
- I think you do.

26:17.644 --> 26:19.211
- I'm not a traitor.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.914
- No, sir, you are a coward.

26:21.981 --> 26:24.751
Trying to blow up a plane
full of civilians,

26:24.817 --> 26:26.653
innocent people.

26:33.559 --> 26:36.495
- And how many innocent
Afghani civilians

26:36.562 --> 26:39.531
did your army kill?

26:41.500 --> 26:43.269
Thousands.

26:43.335 --> 26:46.338
So don't talk to me about
killing innocent civilians.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.174
- Where is he?!
Where is Tamir?!

26:48.240 --> 26:50.677
- I want my lawyer, now.

26:53.079 --> 26:55.547
- Enough, OA.
Walk away.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.984
He invoked his right
to counsel.

27:01.187 --> 27:03.555
Hey, what the hell was that?

27:03.622 --> 27:05.892
We needed answers.
- Yeah, and we got some.

27:05.958 --> 27:08.928
You saw his eyes
when I mentioned Tamir, right?

27:08.995 --> 27:10.462
- Okay.

27:10.529 --> 27:12.799
I think you need
to talk to somebody, okay?

27:12.865 --> 27:15.001
OA, this obsession
that you have with Tamir,

27:15.067 --> 27:16.936
it's unhealthy,
and it's affecting our case.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.971
- Okay, I know it might
be hard for people like you

27:19.038 --> 27:21.307
to understand this, Nina,
but not everybody

27:21.373 --> 27:23.910
that went to war
came back with PTSD

27:23.976 --> 27:25.577
or needs therapy.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.049
Okay?

27:35.287 --> 27:37.323
- Hey, ballistics came back on
the gun that Polat was carrying.

27:37.389 --> 27:39.558
It is not a match to the one
that killed Wilkins, so...

27:39.625 --> 27:41.460
- Well, that doesn't mean
he's not the shooter.

27:41.527 --> 27:43.395
He could have used
a different gun.

27:43.462 --> 27:44.596
- Yeah, but it--

27:44.663 --> 27:45.832
it does mean
we do not have enough

27:45.898 --> 27:47.466
to arrest him
for killing Wilkins.

27:47.533 --> 27:48.735
- Well, we have time
to build that case.

27:48.801 --> 27:50.069
Right now,
we need to determine

27:50.136 --> 27:51.670
if there's another bomb
out there.

27:51.738 --> 27:53.906
The flight Cissneros was
supposed to take doesn't leave

27:53.973 --> 27:56.743
for another hour and a half,
so let's focus on that.

27:56.809 --> 27:59.011
More specifically,
the new TSA agent.

27:59.078 --> 28:01.613
- You know what,
I'll grab Cissneros' backpack

28:01.680 --> 28:03.449
and plane ticket
from evidence right away.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.484
- Good.

28:05.551 --> 28:07.153
- Okay,
scrub every piece of footage.

28:07.219 --> 28:10.522
I need to know if this man
was in the restaurant.

28:21.968 --> 28:24.570
There he is.
Stop the feed.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.207
That's him.

28:28.274 --> 28:30.042
Okay, punch in on his face.

28:31.911 --> 28:34.480
And then take that time code
and scrub every street pod

28:34.546 --> 28:37.049
and security cam
in the immediate area.

28:37.116 --> 28:38.684
- You got it.

28:47.093 --> 28:48.527
- That was Jubal.

28:48.594 --> 28:51.964
- Okay, Ian, I need you
to focus on this for me, okay?

28:52.031 --> 28:54.666
I need you to follow
this man as far as you can.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.869
Every traffic cam, bus cam,
whatever you need to do,

28:56.936 --> 28:59.638
I need you to do it right now.
Do you understand?

29:01.373 --> 29:02.708
- Yeah.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.046
- Thank you.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.272
- All right, Scola, it looks
like there's three TSA agents

29:33.339 --> 29:34.673
on shift at that checkpoint.

29:34.740 --> 29:36.909
Any of them giving you the eye?

29:36.976 --> 29:38.710
- Uh...negative.

29:38.777 --> 29:42.949
They all seem pretty focused
on their screens.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.985
- Sir, a boarding pass?

29:49.721 --> 29:51.757
- Follow me.
- Yup.

29:53.625 --> 29:56.062
It's the victim's supervisor.

30:00.566 --> 30:02.668
- Mr. Reynolds.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.003
You're under arrest.
- Don't make a scene,

30:04.070 --> 30:05.471
and come with us.
- No, n-no.

30:05.537 --> 30:07.639
Please don't do this.
You're gonna get them killed.

30:07.706 --> 30:08.908
- Who's going to be killed?

30:08.975 --> 30:10.276
- They have my wife
and my kid.

30:10.342 --> 30:13.645
They said they'd kill them
if I didn't do this.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.588
- All right, folks.
We have to innocent people

30:22.654 --> 30:23.890
being held by a terrorist,
one that we have no clear ID on.

30:23.956 --> 30:25.191
So where we are
on the phone used

30:25.257 --> 30:26.859
to send that hostage picture?
- It's a burner,

30:26.926 --> 30:28.194
but it's been shut off
since sending that photo

30:28.260 --> 30:29.528
to Reynolds.
- Right. So dead end.

30:29.595 --> 30:30.963
Hey, Kelly, Reynolds said

30:31.030 --> 30:32.965
his wife and kid disappeared
on the way to school.

30:33.032 --> 30:34.700
Let's figure out what route
they would have taken

30:34.766 --> 30:35.935
and start pulling footage--

30:36.002 --> 30:37.369
see if we can get
eyes on this abduction.

30:37.436 --> 30:39.271
- On it.

30:39.338 --> 30:40.572
- Hey.
- Jubal.

30:40.639 --> 30:42.241
I know where Tamir's staying.

30:42.308 --> 30:44.076
- What are you talking about?
Where are you?

30:44.143 --> 30:45.511
- I'm at Jem Polat's
restaurant,

30:45.577 --> 30:46.812
and the security
cam footage here

30:46.879 --> 30:48.014
shows the two of them
interacting.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.415
It gave me a better
glimpse of him.

30:49.481 --> 30:50.616
It is him, Jubal, and I'm
guessing that he's the one

30:50.682 --> 30:51.884
holding on to the hostages.

30:51.951 --> 30:53.785
- All right, hold on.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.254
Well, he sounds
pretty certain,

30:55.321 --> 30:56.855
but by all accounts,
this guy's supposed to be dead,

30:56.923 --> 31:00.226
and OA has had
a rough go lately.

31:01.027 --> 31:03.329
- Yeah, I know. He's been
under a lot of stress.

31:03.395 --> 31:05.197
OA, why don't you come
back to the office,

31:05.264 --> 31:06.532
and we'll talk about
everything?

31:06.598 --> 31:08.134
- With all due respect,
Isobel,

31:08.200 --> 31:09.969
there is no time for that.
I need to head over there.

31:10.036 --> 31:11.737
I have to follow my gut
on this one.

31:11.803 --> 31:13.272
The address
is 254 Industrial Way.

31:13.339 --> 31:15.041
Please have the others
meet me over there.

31:16.642 --> 31:18.010
- All right.
Get the team out there.

31:18.077 --> 31:19.811
Whether he is right or not,
he needs our help.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.713
- Yes, ma'am.

31:24.350 --> 31:25.884
- We're here, buddy.
You all right?

31:25.952 --> 31:27.553
- I'm good, guys.
You ready?

31:27.619 --> 31:29.255
- Hey, any sign of Tamir?

31:29.321 --> 31:31.590
- No. Means we're gonna
have to make entry.

31:46.038 --> 31:48.207
- We have an agent down.
We need an ambulance ASAP.

31:52.111 --> 31:53.745
- Hey, everybody, get back!

31:55.014 --> 31:56.448
Get back, get back!

31:57.683 --> 31:59.118
Fall back!

31:59.185 --> 32:01.220
- Be advised,
we have an active shooter.

32:01.287 --> 32:02.989
Notify the ambulance
to stay wide.

32:03.055 --> 32:05.424
We'll bring the wounded
to them.

32:05.491 --> 32:07.526
- Back up, or she dies!

32:07.593 --> 32:10.029
- It's Tamir.

32:35.821 --> 32:37.656
- Your gut was right.
Sorry I doubted you.

32:37.723 --> 32:39.125
- He's been to the window
several times.

32:39.191 --> 32:41.060
Always with the woman
or the kid as a human shield.

32:41.127 --> 32:42.161
- Right.

32:42.228 --> 32:43.429
All right.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.497
Well, the hostage negotiator
is on their way.

32:45.564 --> 32:46.999
- No, he's not gonna surrender.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.401
- What, you think he'll
kill himself and the hostages?

32:49.468 --> 32:51.637
- He's going to try and escape.
He will lay a trap,

32:51.703 --> 32:54.240
wire the building to explode
the second we make entry.

32:54.306 --> 32:56.342
- How is he going to escape?
We have this place surrounded.

32:56.408 --> 32:58.044
- No, no, no. He's called
"the rat" for a reason.

32:58.110 --> 32:59.645
His M.O. is always
having a way out.

32:59.711 --> 33:01.547
In Kabul, if he didn't have
one, he would dig a tunnel.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.182
- Well, this isn't Kabul.

33:09.455 --> 33:11.057
- We got eyes inside.

33:11.123 --> 33:13.692
- Filament camera fed
through the ventilation system.

33:13.759 --> 33:15.361
- Uh-huh.

33:15.427 --> 33:18.564
Yeah, I'm not buying that
he's digging a tunnel there.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.399
I mean, this guy's trapped.

33:25.304 --> 33:27.373
- Listen.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.608
Tamir Hazara is not going to
choose a hideout

33:29.675 --> 33:31.543
without an escape plan, okay?

33:36.415 --> 33:38.717
How long would it take
to get the sewer schematics

33:38.784 --> 33:40.586
of the area?

33:40.652 --> 33:42.921
- On it.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.526
- OA, Nina, can you hear me?

34:20.592 --> 34:21.793
He is on the move.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.129
Watch yourselves.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.496
...hear me?

34:24.563 --> 34:26.098
...move...

34:35.374 --> 34:38.144
Jubal, it looks like Tamir
has accessed the sewer system,

34:38.210 --> 34:40.379
and we have lost contact
with OA and Nina.

34:40.446 --> 34:41.980
- Okay, copy that.

34:42.047 --> 34:43.649
I mean, we've got all
possible egresses covered

34:43.715 --> 34:45.384
on street level.

35:37.102 --> 35:38.604
- Hostages secured.

35:38.670 --> 35:39.938
No sign of Tamir.

35:40.005 --> 35:41.440
OA, it means
he's down there with you.

37:14.900 --> 37:16.167
- Wife and kid are okay

37:16.234 --> 37:17.903
considering everything
they've been through.

37:17.969 --> 37:19.271
- That's good to hear.

37:19.338 --> 37:21.707
- OA was right about
Tamir wiring the place.

37:21.773 --> 37:24.610
Bomb squad had to diffuse
all six access points.

37:24.676 --> 37:26.578
Enough Semtex
to level the building.

37:26.645 --> 37:28.079
- All right, well...

37:28.146 --> 37:30.316
thing's turned out okay,
I guess, considering.

37:31.517 --> 37:34.052
And hopefully
Omar got some closure.

37:41.860 --> 37:44.062
- Hey.

37:44.129 --> 37:45.664
You okay?

37:45.731 --> 37:47.733
- Yeah.

37:47.799 --> 37:50.669
The ballistic report
came back on Tamir's gun.

37:50.736 --> 37:53.605
Looks like it was the one
used to shoot Wilkins.

37:56.975 --> 37:59.311
- I'm sorry.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.647
- It's okay,
you don't need to apologize.

38:05.083 --> 38:08.053
- I appreciate that, but...

38:08.119 --> 38:10.489
stress is a tricky thing,
you know?

38:10.556 --> 38:13.459
It hides for years
and years and...

38:17.195 --> 38:20.399
One day it'll just
bite you in the ass.

38:21.667 --> 38:24.069
- Yeah.

38:26.505 --> 38:29.475
- I'm always here if
you need to talk, okay?

38:30.842 --> 38:32.544
- I appreciate that.

38:48.427 --> 38:49.461
Hey, Doc.

38:49.528 --> 38:51.129
- Good to see you again,
Omar.

38:51.196 --> 38:52.464
Been a while.

38:52.531 --> 38:53.665
- It has.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.701
It has, um...

38:55.767 --> 38:58.604
I was doing pretty good.

38:58.670 --> 39:01.840
I really thought
I was all better.

39:01.907 --> 39:05.477
Didn't think we were
going to have to talk again.

39:07.379 --> 39:10.215
It's been a tough few days.
