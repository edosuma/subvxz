<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...

00:02.140 --> 00:04.070
Guess what?
I'm buying a Laundromat.
DALE:<i>So,</i>

00:04.100 --> 00:06.990
<i>there's a secret back room
at the Laundromat</i>

00:07.020 --> 00:08.750
<i>where you gamble?</i>

00:09.310 --> 00:10.500
(laughs)<i>Give me a sense</i>

00:10.520 --> 00:12.330
of how illegal this is.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.630
Who says it's illegal?

00:13.650 --> 00:15.000
Well, why is it a secret?

00:15.030 --> 00:16.420
Okay, it's illegal.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.130
What do you know

00:17.150 --> 00:19.380
about these backroom
slot machine places?

00:19.410 --> 00:20.800
We look the other way.

00:23.990 --> 00:24.800
What's going on?

00:24.830 --> 00:26.720
Are you Connie Tucker?

00:26.750 --> 00:29.770
Well, this sucks.

00:29.790 --> 00:31.520
ADULT SHELDON:<i>In astronomy,</i>

00:31.540 --> 00:33.060
<i>a syzygy is a rare event</i>

00:33.090 --> 00:35.980
<i>when three or more
celestial bodies line up.</i>

00:36.000 --> 00:39.900
<i>You may also know it
as the stars aligning,</i>

00:39.930 --> 00:40.990
<i>which was probably coined</i>

00:41.010 --> 00:42.570
<i>by someone
who couldn't spell "syzygy."</i>

00:42.600 --> 00:45.990
<i>If you want to win Scrabble,
remember this bad boy.</i>

00:46.010 --> 00:48.290
<i>My father's idea
of the stars aligning</i>

00:48.310 --> 00:50.580
<i>was having the house

00:50.600 --> 00:54.170
<i>I was at school,
Missy was at a friend's,</i>

00:54.190 --> 00:55.120
<i>Georgie was working,</i>

01:23.680 --> 01:25.320
Hey, Billy. Sheldon's not here.

01:25.350 --> 01:26.910
Is Missy?
Nope.

01:26.930 --> 01:30.520
Good. I need to

01:54.880 --> 01:55.730
So, what's up?

01:55.750 --> 01:59.840
I would like your permission
to ask out Missy.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.320
Really?

02:02.340 --> 02:03.360
Yeah.

02:03.380 --> 02:06.050
Okay. Uh...

02:07.140 --> 02:09.620
Well, I appreciate
you coming to me.

02:09.640 --> 02:12.290
I wanted to do this
the right way.

02:12.310 --> 02:13.120
Uh-huh.

02:13.140 --> 02:16.460
You know, Billy,
this sounds like a big step.

02:16.480 --> 02:20.290
I'm not sure Missy's
really ready for dating yet.

02:20.320 --> 02:22.900
She went out
with Marcus from school.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.130
They went to the movies.

02:25.160 --> 02:27.470
Yeah, that is...

02:27.490 --> 02:28.260
meaningful.

02:28.280 --> 02:31.350
But they broke up,
so now's my chance.

02:31.950 --> 02:34.810
Does Missy know anything
about this?
No.

02:34.830 --> 02:36.440
Great. Let's build on that.

02:36.460 --> 02:40.730
You don't want to be
the rebound guy.

02:40.750 --> 02:41.480
What's that?

02:41.510 --> 02:43.480
That's the guy after the guy
she really liked

02:43.510 --> 02:46.490
and before the next guy
she really likes.

02:46.510 --> 02:47.950
What?
You and Missy

02:47.970 --> 02:50.110
are friends.
You go to school together.

02:50.140 --> 02:52.490
That could
make things complicated

02:52.520 --> 02:53.830
if it doesn't go well.

02:53.850 --> 02:55.950
I didn't think about that.
If she

02:55.980 --> 02:58.580
turns you down, you're gonna
have to see her all the time.

02:58.610 --> 03:01.960
But if it goes right,
I<i>get</i> to see her all the time.

03:01.980 --> 03:04.920
I just think
you ought to take a minute

03:04.950 --> 03:07.340
and figure out
if it's really worth it.

03:07.370 --> 03:08.630
Hmm.
I-It's like football.

03:08.660 --> 03:12.550
You can go for it on fourth down
on your own 20-yard line,

03:12.580 --> 03:16.100
but if you don't make it,
it's game over.

03:16.120 --> 03:18.730
You're not just
a football coach.

03:18.750 --> 03:22.020
You're a coach of life.

03:22.050 --> 03:24.770
You probably think
of quantum physics

03:24.800 --> 03:27.530
<i>as a white-knuckle rush
of adrenaline,</i>

03:27.550 --> 03:29.900
<i>like the</i> Peter Panride
at Disneyland.

03:29.930 --> 03:33.280
<i>But the reality
can be a little less exciting,</i>

03:33.310 --> 03:36.660
<i>especially when you're stuck.</i>

03:57.160 --> 03:58.060
We'll get this.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.770
Perhaps a set of fresh eyes

03:59.790 --> 04:00.520
could be helpful.

04:00.540 --> 04:01.940
If you're going to suggest
Dr. Sturgis,

04:01.960 --> 04:04.520
I should remind you
we have a complicated history.

04:04.550 --> 04:07.070
And your graviton research

04:07.090 --> 04:08.280
is mediocre at best!

04:08.300 --> 04:12.240
You're not qualified
to judge my work.
All right, that's it.

04:17.270 --> 04:20.020
We'll get this.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.000
Hey. You ready for dinner?

04:25.030 --> 04:26.340
Do I look ready?

04:26.360 --> 04:28.360
No.

04:28.780 --> 04:30.720
How was your day, dear?

04:30.740 --> 04:33.390
Well, I ran out of quarters.

04:33.410 --> 04:35.680
Then I had to
break up a fight

04:35.700 --> 04:36.720
over a dryer sheet.

04:36.750 --> 04:41.270
Then washer number three
overflowed again.

04:41.290 --> 04:43.650
Oh. Well, I had a nice day.

04:43.670 --> 04:46.480
I got to pet a horse.

04:46.510 --> 04:49.440
Come on,
let me take you to dinner.

04:49.470 --> 04:51.780
Dinner's not gonna fix
this mess.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.910
Yeah,
I was counting on margaritas

04:53.930 --> 04:54.780
to do the heavy lifting.

04:54.810 --> 04:57.030
This is not
what I signed up for.

04:57.060 --> 04:59.290
I need to get some help in here.

04:59.310 --> 05:00.080
Well, so, do it.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.120
Great. I'm taking Georgie.

05:01.140 --> 05:03.670
Georgie? No,
he's my best employee.

05:03.690 --> 05:05.580
He's my grandson.
Well, so what?

05:05.610 --> 05:07.500
Sheldon's the smart one.
Take him.

05:07.530 --> 05:10.550
Do you want to go out with
somebody who's happy and fun

05:10.570 --> 05:15.370
or some cranky, old woman
who smells like mop?

05:15.450 --> 05:18.930
All right. All right.
Take Georgie.

05:18.950 --> 05:20.910
Thank you.

05:21.160 --> 05:24.420
I'm gonna go get
myself fixed up.

05:24.840 --> 05:28.610
I think you look beautiful
just the way you are.

05:28.630 --> 05:30.020
Go to hell.
Okay.

05:30.050 --> 05:33.650
Triplets left, man in motion.
ANNOUNCER
Play action.

05:33.680 --> 05:35.610
Here comes a pass.
He's got Jefferies deep.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.780
And that'll move the chains.
See there?

05:37.810 --> 05:41.160
Now I know where Sheldon
gets his brains from.

05:41.180 --> 05:41.870
Congratulations.

05:41.890 --> 05:43.960
You're the only person
to ever say that.

05:43.980 --> 05:45.500
What's gonna happen next?

05:45.520 --> 05:47.210
You gonna get me a beer.

05:47.230 --> 05:48.420
Yes, sir.

05:49.150 --> 05:50.710
I'm home.

05:50.740 --> 05:53.510
In here.
Watching the game with Billy.

05:53.530 --> 05:56.510
Do you have the number
where Mom's staying?

05:56.530 --> 05:57.340
Everything okay?

05:57.370 --> 06:00.010
I need help
navigating a situation

06:00.040 --> 06:00.890
with Dr. Linkletter.

06:00.910 --> 06:03.310
You should ask your dad.
He's really smart.

06:03.330 --> 06:05.520
You're the first person
who's ever said that.

06:05.540 --> 06:08.100
Yeah, try me.
I might surprise you.

06:08.130 --> 06:10.820
Dr. Linkletter and I are
stuck on a science problem.

06:10.840 --> 06:14.940
I know Dr. Sturgis could help,
but I'm hesitant to suggest that

06:14.970 --> 06:17.950
because I know they have
a professional rivalry.

06:17.970 --> 06:20.070
Well, the way I see it,

06:20.100 --> 06:22.990
y'all are
on Team Science, right?

06:23.020 --> 06:23.660
I suppose.

06:23.690 --> 06:26.580
And people on the same team
don't have to get along

06:26.610 --> 06:27.580
to work together.

06:27.610 --> 06:28.790
Like you and Mom.

06:28.820 --> 06:30.380
No.

06:30.400 --> 06:31.590
A quarterback

06:31.610 --> 06:32.420
and his receivers.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.170
He doesn't throw it
to the guy he likes best.

06:34.200 --> 06:36.590
He throws it
to the one that's open.

06:36.620 --> 06:37.840
So smart.
So,

06:37.870 --> 06:39.180
I should ask Dr. Sturgis
what he thinks

06:39.200 --> 06:42.010
about the dark matter
being a Bose condensate?

06:42.040 --> 06:43.970
Do you want Team Science to win?

06:44.000 --> 06:47.590
Thank you.
This has been helpful.

06:48.460 --> 06:50.810
What's a Bose condensate?

06:50.840 --> 06:53.400
I'll tell you at halftime.

06:53.420 --> 06:57.070
You fancy yourself a bit
of an entrepreneur, don't you?

06:57.090 --> 06:59.070
I like to think so.
And now

06:59.100 --> 07:00.410
that you're not
in school anymore,

07:00.430 --> 07:02.120
I bet you're wanting
to take your career

07:02.140 --> 07:03.280
to the next level.

07:03.310 --> 07:04.660
What kind of entrepreneur

07:04.690 --> 07:05.790
would I be if I didn't?

07:05.810 --> 07:06.960
Well, this is your lucky day,

07:06.980 --> 07:09.040
because I have
quite the opportunity.

07:09.060 --> 07:12.750
How would you like
to manage a business

07:12.780 --> 07:14.590
all on your own?

07:14.610 --> 07:16.010
That'd be amazing.

07:16.030 --> 07:18.340
Be your own boss.
Call the shots.

07:18.370 --> 07:19.970
Hell, yeah. What is it?

07:19.990 --> 07:21.600
Managing a Laundromat.

07:21.620 --> 07:22.390
No way.

07:22.410 --> 07:23.970
Oh, now, come on.
You're perfect for this.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.930
I'm a salesman.
There's nothing there to sell.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.140
You got a bunch of bored people

07:28.170 --> 07:29.730
with their pockets
full of quarters,

07:29.750 --> 07:30.810
you can't sell them something?

07:30.840 --> 07:34.230
Then you're not the entrepreneur
I thought you were.

07:34.260 --> 07:35.270
That ain't gonna work on me.

07:35.300 --> 07:39.240
And this is why
you're management material.

07:39.260 --> 07:41.350
Nice try.

07:42.220 --> 07:45.660
The place is wall-to-wall girls.

07:45.690 --> 07:48.440
Why didn't you lead with that?

07:50.480 --> 07:51.700
ADULT SHELDON:<i>My brother went</i>

08:10.870 --> 08:12.890

once.

08:14.290 --> 08:15.180
Not in this century.

08:15.210 --> 08:17.730
Listen, I need you to help me
with this.

08:17.750 --> 08:20.310
I don't want to run this dump.

08:20.340 --> 08:21.650
Then why'd you buy it?

08:21.670 --> 08:23.320
I'm retired.

08:23.340 --> 08:27.530
I thought it might be fun,
get me out of the house.

08:27.550 --> 08:28.950
And you picked
a Laundromat?

08:28.970 --> 08:31.370
It seemed
like a better opportunity

08:31.390 --> 08:32.120
at the moment.

08:32.140 --> 08:35.200
What happened? You get
tricked by a con man?

08:35.230 --> 08:37.250
No.
It's all right.

08:37.270 --> 08:40.020
Happens to a lot
of people your age.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.530
Come with me.

08:43.530 --> 08:46.670
Hey, uh, how's bachelor
life treating you?

08:46.700 --> 08:47.170
Good.

08:47.200 --> 08:49.800
Mary makes
this parenting thing seem hard.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.220
I'm great at it.

08:51.240 --> 08:53.390
So, you finally
gave it a shot.

08:53.410 --> 08:54.390
Good for you.

08:54.410 --> 08:55.850
Make your jokes,
but I'm even helping out

08:55.870 --> 08:57.810
kids that aren't mine.
Really?

08:57.830 --> 09:00.770
Billy Sparks
got a little crush on Missy.

09:00.800 --> 09:02.270
Uh-oh.

09:02.300 --> 09:03.980
Danger zone.
What?

09:04.010 --> 09:04.940
Why?

09:06.770 --> 09:08.370
Getting in the middle
of your teenage daughter's

09:08.390 --> 09:11.580
love life?
What could possibly go wrong?

09:11.600 --> 09:13.290
I can't win with you.

09:13.310 --> 09:14.250
I'm not even gonna

09:14.270 --> 09:16.000
tell you
how I helped Sheldon.

09:16.020 --> 09:19.570
It may be better you don't.
Fine.

09:21.860 --> 09:25.300
I used a sports metaphor
about science, and it worked.

09:25.330 --> 09:27.350
I'm sure it did.
It did.

09:27.370 --> 09:29.720
I'm sure.
You should be.

09:29.750 --> 09:31.350
I am.
Good.

09:31.370 --> 09:32.140
It is good.

09:32.170 --> 09:35.520
Are you just gonna
keep having the last word?

09:35.550 --> 09:38.670
No.
Thank you.

09:43.680 --> 09:44.780
Just say it.

09:44.800 --> 09:46.530
You're welcome.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.490
A secret casino room?

09:49.520 --> 09:50.740
Yeah.

09:50.770 --> 09:52.500
The cops shut me down.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.620
That is so cool.
Very cool.

09:54.650 --> 09:56.710
I got a room full of
slot machines I can't

09:56.730 --> 09:59.250
turn on and a room
full of washing machines

09:59.280 --> 10:00.000
I don't want.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.510
Let's get this going again.

10:01.530 --> 10:04.260
I can't. I'm on their radar now.

10:04.280 --> 10:06.010
That sucks.

10:06.030 --> 10:08.600
This is not how I saw
this playing out.

10:08.620 --> 10:12.270
Hey, you took a shot.
That's impressive.

10:12.290 --> 10:13.100
I guess.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.930
I mean, most folks your age
have someone

10:14.960 --> 10:18.020
cutting up their food.
That's enough.

10:18.050 --> 10:20.730
Well, I still think
you're a badass.

10:22.340 --> 10:24.030
Thank you.

10:24.050 --> 10:27.410
We should probably
get back out there.
Oh.

10:27.430 --> 10:29.030
I ain't working for you.

10:29.060 --> 10:31.560
But I'm rooting for you.

10:33.810 --> 10:34.660
So,

10:34.690 --> 10:36.250
how'd it go?
I had Dr. Sturgis

10:36.270 --> 10:40.210
present his ideas
to Dr. Linkletter like you said.

10:40.230 --> 10:40.920
And?

10:40.940 --> 10:44.550
John, I must say, that
might be the stupidest idea

10:44.570 --> 10:45.260
I've ever heard.

10:45.280 --> 10:47.510
Big talk coming from the man

10:47.530 --> 10:50.010
who thought the whole thing
could be explained

10:50.040 --> 10:52.680
with classical field theory.

10:52.710 --> 10:53.310
Oh, no.

10:53.330 --> 10:55.310
Then what happened?
Well...

10:55.330 --> 10:58.560
Why on earth would you bring
this crackpot into my lab?

10:58.590 --> 11:00.100
You didn't mention me, did you?

11:00.130 --> 11:02.150
Because we're all
on Team Science,

11:02.170 --> 11:04.360
and don't we want
Team Science to win?

11:04.380 --> 11:07.400
Okay, good.
But then...

11:07.430 --> 11:08.450
"Team Science"?

11:08.470 --> 11:11.740
And where did you get that
bit of clichéd nonsense?

11:11.770 --> 11:13.370
My dad.

11:14.480 --> 11:16.960
What did you say to Billy?

11:16.980 --> 11:18.460
Uh...

11:18.480 --> 11:20.250
What did Billy say to you?

11:20.270 --> 11:23.630
He asked me out. And he said
he talked to you about it?

11:23.650 --> 11:26.510
Well, yes, but...
Why wouldn't you

11:26.530 --> 11:28.930
warn me? He asked me out
in front of my friends.

11:28.950 --> 11:32.390
I didn't tell him to do it.
I-I told him to think about it.

11:32.410 --> 11:34.760
Well, he thought about it,
and then he did it,

11:34.790 --> 11:35.970
so thanks a lot.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.630
Wayne was right.

11:39.710 --> 11:42.630
You told Coach Wilkins?

11:43.090 --> 11:44.360
A little.

11:44.380 --> 11:45.440
His wife is my teacher.

11:45.470 --> 11:49.090
Do you have any idea
how bad this is?

11:49.300 --> 11:51.110
I'm putting it together.

11:53.140 --> 11:55.200
I didn't tell him to do it!

12:11.040 --> 12:12.810
You see it, right?

12:12.830 --> 12:14.180
That Dr. Sturgis was correct

12:14.210 --> 12:17.230
and I need to eat crow
and go back to him?

12:17.250 --> 12:17.690
Yes.

12:17.710 --> 12:20.760
Let's just give it
another moment.

12:26.880 --> 12:30.510
Morning.
Mmm. Morning.

12:31.510 --> 12:33.530
What's this?

12:33.560 --> 12:35.950
You've been doing such
a good job at home,

12:35.980 --> 12:38.120
I thought you should
be recognized.

12:38.140 --> 12:40.000
Oh.

12:40.020 --> 12:42.210
Thanks.
Mm.

12:42.230 --> 12:44.290
How'd everything
go last night?

12:44.320 --> 12:46.500
Not bad. Not bad.

12:46.530 --> 12:47.920
Glad to hear it.

12:47.950 --> 12:50.260
You lying sack.

12:50.280 --> 12:51.630
What?
I know

12:51.660 --> 12:52.800
Billy asked Missy out

12:52.830 --> 12:54.340
and it all went south.

12:54.370 --> 12:55.850
Darlene told me everything.

12:55.870 --> 12:57.140
Oh, man, how did she find out?

12:57.160 --> 12:59.730
You know how gossip flies
in the teachers' lounge.

12:59.750 --> 13:02.270
Fine.
Everything you said is true.

13:02.290 --> 13:04.400
Shouldn't have gotten involved.

13:04.420 --> 13:06.980
Well, I'm-a let
you keep the mug

13:07.010 --> 13:09.110
as a goal to work towards.

13:09.130 --> 13:09.900
Mm, gee, thanks.

13:09.930 --> 13:12.410
How'd the thing
with Sheldon go?

13:13.810 --> 13:16.620
All right, give
me the mug back.

13:16.640 --> 13:19.560
Gladly.

13:19.890 --> 13:22.710
67 years old,

13:22.730 --> 13:24.210
scraping Tootsie Roll out

13:24.230 --> 13:27.780
of a clothes dryer.
Hey.

13:28.110 --> 13:29.380
What do you want?

13:29.400 --> 13:30.470
I want to help you out.

13:30.490 --> 13:33.340
Oh, I knew you'd
come back. Listen,

13:33.370 --> 13:34.090
I got most of it,

13:34.120 --> 13:36.890
but there's this one chunk
in there that won't let go.

13:36.910 --> 13:39.310
I'm not here to work.
I'm here with the answers

13:39.330 --> 13:40.600
to all your problems.

13:40.620 --> 13:42.480
And what is that?

13:42.500 --> 13:45.270
How to get your back room
up and running again.

13:45.290 --> 13:46.650
I'm listening.

13:46.670 --> 13:49.230
I was thinking
about Chuck E. Cheese.

13:49.260 --> 13:50.900
Oh, God.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.400
Hear me out.

13:52.430 --> 13:55.490
<i>Your payouts were in cash.</i>

13:55.510 --> 13:57.530
<i>That's illegal.</i>

13:57.560 --> 14:00.990
<i>When you play games
at Chuck E. Cheese,</i>

14:01.020 --> 14:01.830
<i>you win tickets.</i>

14:01.850 --> 14:05.170
<i>Those tickets are traded
for prizes.</i>

14:05.190 --> 14:06.500
<i>That's legal.</i>

14:06.530 --> 14:08.960
<i>You just need to do
the same thing.</i>

14:08.990 --> 14:10.300
<i>People play your machines.</i>

14:10.320 --> 14:13.130
<i>Now the credits they win
get exchanged</i>

14:13.160 --> 14:14.090
<i>for stuffed animals.</i>

14:14.120 --> 14:16.140
<i>Then you buy
those stuffed animals back</i>

14:16.160 --> 14:17.090
<i>for cash.</i>

14:17.120 --> 14:20.100
No laws broken,
and you're back in business.

14:20.120 --> 14:23.770
That's the stupidest thing
I ever heard.

14:23.790 --> 14:24.560
Why?

14:24.590 --> 14:26.310
Because I don't run a carnival.

14:26.340 --> 14:28.820
Grown-up people
don't-don't gamble

14:28.840 --> 14:30.110
to win a teddy bear.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.110
You're not getting it.

14:31.130 --> 14:32.900
I'm getting that it's dumb.

14:32.930 --> 14:34.110
I'm trying to help you.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.320
If you really wanted to help me,

14:35.340 --> 14:38.990
you would stick your head
in there and start scraping.

14:39.020 --> 14:41.200
ADULT SHELDON:<i>Eventually,</i>

14:41.230 --> 14:42.500
<i>Dr. Linkletter admitted</i>

14:42.520 --> 14:44.580
<i>we could use the help
of Dr. Sturgis,</i>

14:44.610 --> 14:47.170
<i>and Team Science
was back in action</i>

14:47.190 --> 14:50.460
<i>scoring goals
against Team Ignorance.</i>

14:50.480 --> 14:53.010
Look at me, talking like a jock.

14:53.030 --> 14:53.670
Oh, I see

14:53.700 --> 14:54.920
you came around to my idea

14:54.950 --> 14:57.510
for distinguishing
massive particles

14:57.530 --> 14:58.680
from axion particles.

14:58.700 --> 15:01.100
Well, it did provide
an excellent jumping-off point

15:01.120 --> 15:03.520
for me to crack
the actual problem.

15:03.540 --> 15:05.560
Seems the actual problem
is your inability

15:05.580 --> 15:09.230
to recognize a brilliant idea
when it's handed to you.

15:09.250 --> 15:12.440
Is that so,
you pedantic little gremlin?

15:12.470 --> 15:14.070
How dare you!

15:14.090 --> 15:15.490
Well, it's all
just simple...

15:15.510 --> 15:16.910
ADULT SHELDON:<i>My father was right.</i>

15:16.930 --> 15:19.490
<i>They were bringing
the best out of each other,</i>

15:19.510 --> 15:21.370
<i>like steel sharpening steel.</i>

15:21.390 --> 15:22.870
Although I suppose,
based on your premise,

15:22.890 --> 15:26.080
we could calculate the
stress-energy tensor for each.
ADULT SHELDON:<i>It turned out</i>

15:26.100 --> 15:28.880
<i>their antagonism
was the key to their success.</i>

15:28.900 --> 15:30.590
...find an experiment
to distinguish them.

15:30.610 --> 15:34.920
While derivative, I'll admit
your point does have some merit.

15:34.950 --> 15:36.970
Of course it has merit,

15:36.990 --> 15:37.970
you... you...

15:37.990 --> 15:40.510
Big, pink Sasquatch?
Good.

15:40.530 --> 15:42.930
You big, pink Sasquatch!

15:45.710 --> 15:46.940
Bink's the name.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.770
Dr. Bink.
Dr. Fink?

15:48.790 --> 15:51.980
Bink. With a "buh,"
"buh," "buh."

15:52.010 --> 15:53.730
How you doing?

15:53.760 --> 15:56.380
Fine.

15:57.550 --> 15:58.610
Things okay at school?

15:58.640 --> 16:02.320
Why? So you can go
tell your friends?

16:02.350 --> 16:05.620
I just want to know
how you're doing.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.290
Let's see. Billy feels bad.

16:07.310 --> 16:08.580
I feel bad for turning him down.

16:08.610 --> 16:11.000
Everything's awkward
and terrible now.

16:11.020 --> 16:14.740
Does that answer your question?

16:27.270 --> 16:28.160
Hey.

16:28.180 --> 16:30.330
Thanks for letting me come by.

16:30.350 --> 16:30.910
Sure.

16:30.940 --> 16:33.500
How's he doing?
I don't know.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.540
He never tells me anything.

16:35.570 --> 16:37.040
Well, Missy talks.

16:37.070 --> 16:38.920
It is not an improvement.

16:38.940 --> 16:41.460
Billy!

16:41.490 --> 16:44.220
Mr. Cooper's here!

16:44.240 --> 16:45.760
How you doing?

16:45.780 --> 16:49.750
Oh, do not look under that rock.

16:50.040 --> 16:53.500
But I appreciate you asking.

16:54.710 --> 16:56.610
Tough week, huh?

16:56.630 --> 16:57.940
Yeah.

16:57.960 --> 16:59.440
Yeah, I been there.

16:59.470 --> 17:01.190
You have?
Oh, yeah.

17:01.220 --> 17:03.610
Darcy Lockhart, eighth grade.

17:03.640 --> 17:06.070
Shut me down on the school bus.

17:06.100 --> 17:08.530
That sounds awful.
Couldn't even leave.

17:08.560 --> 17:12.910
Just had to sit there.
I asked nine stops too early.

17:12.940 --> 17:14.330
What did you do?

17:14.360 --> 17:15.460
I felt bad for a while,

17:15.480 --> 17:18.500
but then I asked out
Maggie Gormly.

17:18.530 --> 17:19.630
She said yes?

17:19.650 --> 17:20.420
Absolutely not.

17:20.440 --> 17:24.050
And would you believe I did it
on the bus a second time?

17:24.070 --> 17:26.010
What a dope.

17:26.030 --> 17:29.600
Well, I'm never
asking anybody out again.

17:29.620 --> 17:31.680
You will.

17:31.710 --> 17:34.350
At least the worst part's over.

17:34.380 --> 17:36.100
Doesn't feel like it.
Hey.

17:36.130 --> 17:39.980
You got rejected,
but was it the end of the world?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.110
No.
And that

17:41.130 --> 17:42.730
is extremely valuable
information.

17:42.760 --> 17:48.100
A lot of guys don't learn that
and stop taking chances.

17:49.930 --> 17:50.660
And honestly,

17:50.680 --> 17:53.080
you dodged a bullet with Missy.

17:53.100 --> 17:55.000
The girl is mean.

17:55.020 --> 17:56.870
Thanks.

18:03.740 --> 18:08.090
ADULT SHELDON:<i>My father didn't always get
the credit he deserved.</i>

18:08.120 --> 18:13.010
<i>The advice he gave meactually worked out pretty well.</i>

18:13.040 --> 18:16.630
<i>Of course, I never told him.</i>

18:17.960 --> 18:19.730
Talked to Billy.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.940
Why would you do that?

18:21.960 --> 18:23.110
No, it was good.

18:23.130 --> 18:26.470
Stay out of my life.

18:27.800 --> 18:32.640
He may not have been
the world's greatest dad.

18:32.930 --> 18:37.310
<i>But maybe we weren't
the world's greatest kids.</i>

18:42.990 --> 18:45.800
I guess
I'll just sell the place.

18:45.820 --> 18:48.260
If I take a bath, so be it.

18:48.280 --> 18:50.590
Oh, I don't know.
I got a realtor friend,

18:50.620 --> 18:51.510
might be able to help.

18:51.540 --> 18:54.890
You mean like your cop friend
who shut me down?

18:54.910 --> 18:57.560
Yeah, that wasn't great.

18:57.580 --> 18:58.770
Mm.

18:58.790 --> 19:00.600
What about Georgie's idea?

19:00.630 --> 19:03.440
The dumb Chuck E. Cheese thing?
Dale, come on.

19:03.470 --> 19:05.650
Well, actually,
I think it's kind of brilliant.

19:05.680 --> 19:09.280
You think that grown-ups
are gonna gamble

19:09.300 --> 19:10.410
for some stuffed animals?

19:10.430 --> 19:11.910
Yeah, that you're
buying back from them.

19:11.930 --> 19:15.910
Well, a teddy bear's
only worth a couple of bucks.

19:15.930 --> 19:17.580
It's worth whatever
you say it's worth.

19:17.600 --> 19:22.650
They win a hundred bucks, then
it's worth a hundred bucks.

19:27.150 --> 19:30.490
It seems I owe you an apology.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.040
Come on in.
