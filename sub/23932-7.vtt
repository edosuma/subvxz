00:03.790 --> 00:05.951
Roseanne, get in here.

00:05.960 --> 00:07.245
What?

00:07.250 --> 00:08.911
You can't just
stand on the front porch

00:08.920 --> 00:11.206
staring at your
Muslim neighbors.

00:13.290 --> 00:15.246
It just so obvious
you're spying on them.

00:15.250 --> 00:18.378
No, it isn't.
I've got a rake.

00:18.380 --> 00:21.452
Holding a rake
and staring is not a cover.

00:21.460 --> 00:23.246
Raking is a cover.

00:23.250 --> 00:24.877
Now come on.

00:24.880 --> 00:26.279
We need
three people

00:26.290 --> 00:28.372
to make this into
a fun coupon club.

00:28.380 --> 00:30.029
Otherwise, we're just
two poor people

00:30.040 --> 00:31.951
trying to save a nickel
on tuna.

00:33.250 --> 00:36.572
Did you see the crazy
amount of fertilizer

00:36.580 --> 00:38.741
they got stacked up
near their garage?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.371
That's how
they make bombs.

00:44.040 --> 00:46.417
What if this is a sleeper cell
full of terrorists

00:46.420 --> 00:48.911
getting ready to blow up
our neighborhood?

00:48.920 --> 00:50.911
What proof do you have,
Roseanne?

00:50.920 --> 00:54.879
This proof -- anytime
something bad happens,

00:54.880 --> 00:58.748
it's always somebody who lives
next door to somebody.

01:00.120 --> 01:03.533
Oh, my God,
you figured it out.

01:03.540 --> 01:05.167
Terrorists are
always neighbors.

01:05.170 --> 01:07.411
So, all we have to do

01:07.420 --> 01:10.321
is arrest everybody!

01:10.330 --> 01:14.243
I'm telling you, this is what
people from Iraq

01:14.250 --> 01:17.322
and Talibanistan do!

01:18.880 --> 01:21.701
They hide out in neighborhoods
like Lanford.

01:21.710 --> 01:24.326
Don't you watch the news?!

01:24.330 --> 01:26.707
You don't mean the news,
you mean Fox News,

01:26.710 --> 01:30.373
and,uh".

01:30.380 --> 01:33.372
there is no Talibanis--
oh, forget it.

01:33.380 --> 01:35.530
Jump in, here,
Anne-Marie.

01:35.540 --> 01:38.612
Oh, because I'm black,
I'm the expert on racism?

01:38.620 --> 01:40.076
Oh, geez,
I am so sorry.

01:40.080 --> 01:42.708
I'm willing to learn
from my mistakes.
Well, good.

01:42.710 --> 01:45.417
So, in that case, if you
just give me the 50% off

01:45.420 --> 01:48.162
on this cream cheese,
we'll call it even.

01:48.170 --> 01:50.991
If you're so sure
they're not terrorists,

01:51.000 --> 01:54.117
go out there and look at
how much fertilizer they've got.

01:54.120 --> 01:57.078
If it makes you shut up
and stop with this, then fine.

02:00.620 --> 02:03.032
That's not that
much fertilizer.
Hold on.

02:04.880 --> 02:07.952
That is, like, a crazy
amount of fertilizer.

02:07.960 --> 02:10.110
But...it doesn't
mean anything.

02:11.460 --> 02:14.111
[ Sighs ] I'm done
talking to you people.

02:16.040 --> 02:18.372
Hi, Chuck.
Oh, hey, Rosie.

02:18.380 --> 02:22.328
Dan, our new neighbors
have way too much fertilizer.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.490
After 45 years
of marriage,

02:26.500 --> 02:28.070
you run out of things
to talk about.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.239
We don't have time.

02:34.250 --> 02:36.377
We're getting ready
for this meeting.

02:36.380 --> 02:38.109
They're probably
just regular folks

02:38.120 --> 02:40.247
who want to make
a home here.

02:40.250 --> 02:43.322
They painted their fence,
they put in a new mailbox.

02:43.330 --> 02:45.821
They have an American flag,
for God's sake.

02:45.830 --> 02:47.457
Oh, Dan, I don't know.

02:47.460 --> 02:49.246
I'm gonna have to go
with Rosie on this one.

02:50.750 --> 02:53.617
It sounds like they're trying
a little too hard.

02:55.120 --> 02:56.747
When I drove
through the South,

02:56.750 --> 02:58.820
I had a Lynyrd Skynyrd
bumper sticker.

03:00.420 --> 03:02.115
Granny Rose!
Grandpa Dan!

03:02.120 --> 03:03.371
Hey.

03:03.380 --> 03:05.610
Oh, that's quite
an outfit, Mary.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.498
Did Daddy let you
dress yourself today?

03:08.500 --> 03:09.569
No.

03:09.580 --> 03:12.117
That's what I figured.

03:15.880 --> 03:18.030
So, is it cool if Mary spends
the night with you tonight?

03:18.040 --> 03:19.610
I have a really early
appointment

03:19.620 --> 03:20.871
at the V.A. tomorrow
in Danville.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.826
You're all mine!

03:23.830 --> 03:26.378
Why are you leaving tonight
if you've got an appointment

03:26.380 --> 03:27.824
in the morning?

03:27.830 --> 03:29.786
'Cause the line will be
all the way down the sidewalk.

03:29.790 --> 03:31.326
A lot of vets
live on the sidewalk,

03:31.330 --> 03:33.036
so they have
an advantage.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.372
Hey, Deej.
Hi, Mary.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.450
Uh, nothing happened to you
in the Army, did it?

03:37.460 --> 03:39.496
You can still
see patterns, right?

03:42.080 --> 03:43.456
Okay,
I almost forgot.

03:43.460 --> 03:45.371
Tonight is Mary's
Slqpe call with Geena.

03:45.380 --> 03:47.871
It's on Afghanistan time,
so it's 2:00 am. here.

03:47.880 --> 03:50.326
That's oh-two-hundred.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.787
I don't know how
to do the Skype

03:52.790 --> 03:54.781
or get up at 2:00 am.

03:56.540 --> 03:58.747
After my nighttime
meds kick in,

03:58.750 --> 04:00.877
I'm legally dead
till 7:00 am.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.241
Darlene, will you help Mom
with the Skype call?

04:06.250 --> 04:08.036
Oh, sure,
waking Mom at 2:00 am.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.668
to explain technology's
kind of what I live for.

04:10.670 --> 04:12.661
Okay, thanks.

04:12.670 --> 04:15.286
Okay, now, you be good
tonight for Granny.

04:15.290 --> 04:17.918
Can't you stay here,
too?
I can't, honey.

04:17.920 --> 04:20.571
Hey, you know what
would be super-fun?

04:20.580 --> 04:23.879
An all-girls slumber party
'cause we could put a tent up

04:23.880 --> 04:26.075
in the living room and do
each other's hair and makeup

04:26.080 --> 04:28.457
and watch videos
and make brownies

04:28.460 --> 04:30.872
and tell ghost stories.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.371
That sounds fun.
That sounds horrible.

04:35.170 --> 04:36.990
But what if
I can't sleep?

04:37.000 --> 04:38.786
Well, then, I'll tell you
a bedtime story

about two of
my dear friends,

04:40.210 --> 04:42.371

04:47.120 --> 04:50.112

as a kid.

how It ends.

05:38.580 --> 05:41.208
Don't try to pronounce anything,
just point to the pictures.

05:43.120 --> 05:45.247
Okay, but just so you know,
when you get it,

05:45.250 --> 05:46.660
it won't look like that.

05:47.750 --> 05:49.957
Make it two.

05:49.960 --> 05:51.666
Nothing for me.
Thanks.

05:51.670 --> 05:53.535
Check it out, Al.

05:53.540 --> 05:56.418
I got these little
"sign here" stickers for you

05:56.420 --> 05:58.240
so you'll know
just where to sign.

05:58.250 --> 06:00.707
I will need those back,
though.

06:00.710 --> 06:03.702
All you got to do is sign,
give us a deposit check...

And in three months,
your apartments

06:05.210 --> 06:06.825

can knock holes in

able to go with you

And we work for union minimum.
Nobody's gonna beat that, Al.

and I can't pass it up.
