00:05.900 --> 00:08.467
NARRATOR: On this episode
of Life Below Zero,

00:08.500 --> 00:12.433
the thaw is coming to an end
and the pressure is building.

00:12.467 --> 00:13.900
SUE: Oh, God.

00:13.933 --> 00:17.833
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
have one last chance
at a summer catch.

00:17.867 --> 00:19.667
That's a big hole.

00:19.700 --> 00:23.267
NARRATOR: In Iliamna,
Erik and Martha's
quest for food hits a snag.

00:23.300 --> 00:24.933
MARTHA: You're hitting bottom.

00:24.967 --> 00:27.133
NARRATOR: Dreams for
a new home in Eagle
are falling apart.

00:27.167 --> 00:28.900
You're going
to break the glass.

00:28.933 --> 00:32.133
NARRATOR: And a
mechanical failure
puts Sue's camp at risk.

00:32.167 --> 00:34.333
SUE: It's more than just me
that can die

00:34.367 --> 00:36.467
if things don't get fixed.

00:50.400 --> 00:52.000
SUE: You got her?
D: All set.

00:52.033 --> 00:55.367
Well, you ready to go
get a cup of coffee,
and get your ticket

00:55.400 --> 00:57.567
-and get on your way? Or...
-Absolutely.

00:57.600 --> 01:02.200
NARRATOR: Kavik River Camp
is the only refuelling station
for almost 100 miles.

01:02.233 --> 01:06.733
Pilots rely on Sue Aikens
for fuel, comfort,
and a safe landing.

01:06.767 --> 01:10.633
In turn, they provide
the income that keeps
her doors open.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.667
(INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER)

01:18.100 --> 01:19.767
Hey, buddy, how you doing?

01:21.067 --> 01:23.300
(D SPEAKING)

01:23.333 --> 01:26.100
Hey.

01:26.133 --> 01:28.133
Hey, do you got a copy on me?

01:28.167 --> 01:29.333
(D SPEAKING)

01:31.533 --> 01:34.100
Can you hear me?
You're breaking up, buddy.

01:37.533 --> 01:39.200
All right, yeah,
see that's not good.

01:39.233 --> 01:42.833
My generator's
having an issue. I got to go.

01:42.867 --> 01:46.600
My generator is racing,
coming down,
racing, it's having an issue.

01:46.633 --> 01:50.233
My air-to-ground radio
for pilot safety,
uh, depends on that.

01:50.267 --> 01:51.900
I can't give them
the wind conditions.

01:51.933 --> 01:53.467
They don't know if they're
going to be landing

01:53.500 --> 01:56.667
in a 20-mile-an-hour
crosswind,
or head on or tailwind.

01:56.700 --> 01:59.700
They don't know,
unless I tell them,
what the conditions are.

01:59.733 --> 02:03.067
So I have to put
on the website,
"Gens are going down,

02:03.100 --> 02:04.733
"it'll be down
until further notice.

02:04.767 --> 02:09.200
"VFR, Visual flying
is going to be the rule."

02:09.233 --> 02:12.533
Put the bright red notice
that you can't really miss

02:12.567 --> 02:16.433
that I'm, uh, going to have
the power down,
air-to-ground will be off.

02:16.467 --> 02:20.767
They've got their information
on exactly the degrees
and bearings.

02:20.800 --> 02:24.267
The conditions
have been updated,
the timestamp is updated.

02:24.300 --> 02:27.133
The longer I stay
out of communication,

02:27.167 --> 02:28.433
domino, domino, domino.

02:28.467 --> 02:30.367
They're all falling.
People can't get a hold of me.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.067
Somebody's hurting,
can't get help.

02:32.100 --> 02:34.333
Plane is circling around
in the fog,

02:34.367 --> 02:37.967
doesn't know what to do.
I'm not answering.

02:38.067 --> 02:40.200
It's more than just me

02:40.233 --> 02:42.567
that can die if things
don't get fixed.

02:42.600 --> 02:46.200
There's a whole population
of people up here
that have got to rely on me.

02:46.233 --> 02:49.733
So time to quit talking,
shut the shit down
and get it down.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.767
CHIP: This place has always
got some new little
secret to reveal

02:56.267 --> 02:58.800
or some little surprise
to pull on me.

02:58.833 --> 03:01.133
I really look forward to it.

03:01.167 --> 03:02.367
It makes you wake up
in the morning and go,

03:02.400 --> 03:04.200
"Wow, what's this day
going to be like?"

03:17.133 --> 03:18.200
CAROL: Dad! Mom!

03:18.233 --> 03:19.800
AGNES: Come on, girls.
Let's go fishing!

03:21.967 --> 03:26.433
NARRATOR: The Hailstones
have spent their summer
in Kiwalik, fishing...

03:26.467 --> 03:28.433
Nice little haul
we got going here.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.800
...hunting...

03:30.833 --> 03:32.267
CHIP: Hit him now!

03:32.300 --> 03:33.800
...and gathering.

03:34.733 --> 03:36.233
Oh, I can see eggs!

03:36.267 --> 03:38.600
Six of them. Six eggs.

03:39.967 --> 03:42.267
NARRATOR: But with limited
days left in camp,

03:42.300 --> 03:45.667
they can't afford to let
any resources slip away.

03:50.767 --> 03:52.333
AGNES: That's a good fish.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.467
That big one sure
ripped that net.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.667
Part of being a fisherman,
is taking care of your gear.

03:58.700 --> 04:01.767
And what we're going to do
is necessary maintenance.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.500
The webs get ripped.
It's just a fact of life.

04:04.533 --> 04:07.667
Ugh, there it is.
That's a big hole.

04:07.700 --> 04:10.133
CHIP: The fact is, if we want
to catch salmon,
we've got to use the net.

04:10.167 --> 04:13.133
If we want to use
the net properly,
we have to maintain that net.

04:13.167 --> 04:14.600
So we have to do
the work that we do

04:14.633 --> 04:16.933
to keep the net going
so that the net
will keep us going.

04:16.967 --> 04:18.900
AGNES: I'm just gonna
sew it back together.

04:18.933 --> 04:22.400
I'm not gonna be making
new webbings or anything.

04:22.433 --> 04:24.400
I shouldn't be
out here too long,

04:24.433 --> 04:27.533
and I should be done before
the mosquitoes drive me nuts.

04:28.233 --> 04:29.533
This is a fishing needle.

04:29.567 --> 04:32.067
Some people
call them shuttles.

04:32.067 --> 04:34.367
They're a real good,
handy tool.

04:34.400 --> 04:38.067
All it does is pretty much
just going in loops and loops,

04:38.067 --> 04:40.767
just making squares.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.367
It's a long, slow process.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.800
Nets are her area
of expertise.

04:43.833 --> 04:47.667
She grew up fishing with nets,
making nets, hanging nets.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.433
Everything you could
do to possibly fish,

04:49.467 --> 04:52.067
my wife has extensive
knowledge and skills with.

04:52.067 --> 04:56.700
And, Carol, this is how you
have to use your needle,
your shuttle.

04:56.733 --> 05:01.100
Try to stitch the hole,
you just, um, keep trying
to go up and down,

05:01.133 --> 05:04.233
and trying to make,
uh, little squares

05:04.267 --> 05:06.233
big enough to where
the fish will get caught,

05:06.267 --> 05:10.067
and just keep unravelling
your twine

05:10.100 --> 05:13.867
and keep going around
and making knots and tie them.

05:13.900 --> 05:15.567
Then move to the next one.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.533
I'm not the best repairer,
but I know enough
just to get by.

05:18.567 --> 05:21.233
My favourite part
about camping out here

05:21.267 --> 05:24.400
was being with my family
and learning how to fish

05:24.433 --> 05:28.067
and what plants to eat,
and what plants not to eat.

05:28.067 --> 05:29.700
It's important
to learn these skills

05:29.733 --> 05:33.167
because, when you're older,
it'll help you make food.

05:34.833 --> 05:38.133
Should be good enough
to put back out.

05:39.600 --> 05:43.233
Right on, we're done.
No more holes.

05:43.267 --> 05:45.567
Let's, uh, go fishing.

05:49.267 --> 05:51.800
ANDY: Can you handle
being alone?

05:51.833 --> 05:53.600
Do you enjoy being alone?

05:54.733 --> 05:57.367
Do you feel lonely
when you're alone?

05:58.667 --> 06:00.733
If you feel lonely
when you're alone,

06:00.767 --> 06:03.100
this could be a pretty
tough life to live.

06:14.167 --> 06:16.867
All right, let this
project begin.

06:16.900 --> 06:19.933
NARRATOR: With sunlight
dwindling, and winter
on the horizon,

06:19.967 --> 06:24.400
Andy and Kate focus
on their passion project,
a new cabin.

06:26.067 --> 06:27.667
ANDY: I have very little time
right now

06:27.700 --> 06:31.400
to get this house winterised
and ready for the snow to fly.

06:31.433 --> 06:36.367
First things first, I have
to get this place sanded
before I can get it stained.

06:39.800 --> 06:42.067
Step one
is building a scaffold.

06:43.333 --> 06:45.200
So I'm going to throw
some ladders up,

06:45.233 --> 06:50.867
nail a few boards up
onto the sides of the house
to support the ladders.

06:50.900 --> 06:54.800
And it's really hard to work
efficiently when you're just
one-handing it with a ladder,

06:54.833 --> 06:58.200
so I want to set up a system
where I have at least a board

06:58.233 --> 07:00.800
that I can raise and lower
and I can run my sander.

07:00.833 --> 07:04.433
I've got two hands
and a stable platform
to stand on.

07:04.467 --> 07:07.400
Nothing worse than trying
to sand off of a ladder.

07:07.433 --> 07:08.900
(DRILL WHIRRING)

07:08.933 --> 07:13.067
The time spent putting up some
scaffolding systems right now

07:13.067 --> 07:15.267
is going to pay off
in dividends for me,

07:15.300 --> 07:18.567
when it comes time to actually
start doing the job.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.733
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

07:21.767 --> 07:25.433
This is so typical.
I mean, I started out today,
it was nice and sunny

07:25.467 --> 07:27.233
and clear and warm,
I'm in a T-shirt.

07:27.267 --> 07:29.567
I'm ready to go get
some work done.

07:29.600 --> 07:31.267
Here comes the rain.

07:32.300 --> 07:34.767
This has been what it's like
all summer.

07:34.800 --> 07:39.767
At some point in the day
it rains, sometimes all day,
sometimes, every couple hours.

07:41.367 --> 07:45.333
Give it another 10
or 15 minutes and see
what it does here.

07:45.367 --> 07:47.567
I've never seen
a summer like this.

07:53.800 --> 07:58.633
I'm going to run out,
hit that wall and see
if it sticks at all.

08:14.500 --> 08:16.533
KATE: It's an unreasonable
list most of the time,

08:16.567 --> 08:18.500
and he's, he's
a very hard worker.

08:18.533 --> 08:20.767
And he's...
Daylight till dark,

08:20.800 --> 08:23.167
he's just busy, busy, busy,

08:23.200 --> 08:26.300
and he likes to just
get things done.

08:41.100 --> 08:43.200
That ain't working.

08:45.800 --> 08:47.100
Too wet.

08:48.733 --> 08:50.833
Clogging up the paper.

08:50.867 --> 08:52.500
I think this day is done.

08:52.533 --> 08:56.333
I'm feeling like if I don't
get this house sanded

08:56.367 --> 08:59.533
and get the windows in,
I've pretty much
failed this summer.

09:02.100 --> 09:04.267
ERIK: I don't think
that the way I live

09:04.300 --> 09:06.067
is the way to live

09:06.100 --> 09:08.100
and that other people
are doing it wrong.

09:08.133 --> 09:12.667
Each human being is in their
pursuit of happiness,
doing it their own way.

09:16.633 --> 09:18.700
-You ready, babe?
-Yeah, I'm ready.

09:18.733 --> 09:19.933
Let's go get some birds.

09:19.967 --> 09:21.433
You jump in and I'll push out.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.333
ERIK: And right now,
Martha and I are just doing

09:24.367 --> 09:26.067
some subsistence
waterfowl hunting,

09:26.067 --> 09:28.067
and hopefully putting up
enough birds

09:28.067 --> 09:30.067
to keep us going here
for a little while

09:30.067 --> 09:31.467
before the fish come in.

09:31.500 --> 09:34.167
NARRATOR: Erik Salitan
and his new wife, Martha,

09:34.200 --> 09:36.833
are spending
the summer in Iliamna,

09:36.867 --> 09:40.267
in hopes of harvesting
the region's
hard-earned resources.

09:43.067 --> 09:46.067
But navigating the river
is no easy task,

09:46.067 --> 09:48.067
even for seasoned hunters.

09:48.100 --> 09:49.900
Yeah, you want to watch
for rocks around here.

09:49.933 --> 09:51.667
ERIK: I know.
I'm turning around.

09:51.700 --> 09:54.467
Whoa. Slow down,
why're you going so fast?

09:56.533 --> 09:59.233
I don't want to be
ejected from the boat.

09:59.267 --> 10:00.600
Where are you... Yep.

10:02.067 --> 10:03.133
Fuckin' turn.

10:03.167 --> 10:05.267
I can smell it now.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.667
-You can smell it?
-Yes, I can smell the motor.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.500
We are literally
a floating duck,
a sitting duck.

10:14.533 --> 10:17.033
(ENGINE SHUDDERING)

10:17.067 --> 10:18.900
MARTHA: That doesn't
sound very good.

10:18.933 --> 10:20.100
ERIK: No.

10:21.067 --> 10:22.833
Oh, my God.

10:22.867 --> 10:24.433
You know, whenever you're
running the river,

10:24.467 --> 10:26.900
you need to read the water,
read the riffles,

10:26.933 --> 10:29.000
read the colours and be aware

10:29.033 --> 10:30.700
that there's all sorts
of submerged dangers,

10:30.733 --> 10:33.200
and, uh, at this time of year,
the river's really shallow.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.967
There's a lot of gravel bars
you need to watch out for,
with a boat.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.600
I wouldn't start
it right here.

10:37.633 --> 10:40.033
You're just going to do
the same thing you just did.

10:40.067 --> 10:41.700
Paddle us out.

10:41.733 --> 10:45.467
How am I going to paddle us
out in the wind?

10:45.500 --> 10:48.233
That's not going to happen.
You've got waders on.

11:00.433 --> 11:02.167
ERIK: There's more along
that shore there.

11:02.200 --> 11:04.267
Let's go home
and look around down there.

11:04.300 --> 11:06.233
-Okay, that sounds like
a good idea.
-Let's get out of here.

11:06.267 --> 11:07.567
MARTHA: All right.

11:10.933 --> 11:13.867
CHIP: I think everybody should
experience at least once
where food comes from.

11:13.900 --> 11:16.667
My food comes from the wild
and we got to run it down
and kill it.

11:16.700 --> 11:19.733
If it flies, swims, crawls,
grows underground
or towards the sun,

11:19.767 --> 11:21.200
I'll probably eat it.

11:29.400 --> 11:30.800
(COUGHS)

11:31.433 --> 11:32.667
Wow, what a day.

11:35.067 --> 11:37.733
Hi, sweetie pie.
You guys watching this fire?

11:37.767 --> 11:39.433
Don't let it get
on the tundra.

11:39.467 --> 11:42.067
If I'm over there working,
you guys don't let it get away
from you, okay?

11:42.067 --> 11:44.600
NARRATOR:
With the net repaired
and back in the river,

11:44.633 --> 11:47.367
Chip turns his attention
to building a new fish rack,

11:47.400 --> 11:50.367
in hopes that the fixed net
will yield good results.

11:52.233 --> 11:54.567
CHIP: I'm making
a fish rack for some salmon

11:54.600 --> 11:58.067
and I'm going to make it
into a bit of a smokehouse
at one end.

12:00.900 --> 12:03.200
Once I build this, I'll have a
place to put the fish.

12:07.100 --> 12:08.333
The importance of smoking
is, number one,

12:08.367 --> 12:09.700
to keep the flies
off the meat.

12:09.733 --> 12:11.533
Because you don't want flies
laying eggs,

12:11.567 --> 12:13.333
and making maggots,
and destroying your meat,

12:13.367 --> 12:14.800
and making it putrid
and rotten.

12:14.833 --> 12:16.400
Number two, it flavours it.

12:23.767 --> 12:25.400
I'm going to make a smoke
shack at that end

12:25.433 --> 12:27.500
by enclosing it, so that
the smoke drifts to this end.

12:27.533 --> 12:31.333
I'll leave this end open so I
can walk in and out
and check on my fish.

12:32.933 --> 12:35.433
Every summer,
we still salmon fish.

12:35.467 --> 12:37.200
We want to have
a little bit of security.

12:38.300 --> 12:40.067
This is food security.

12:42.133 --> 12:43.633
This will get us through
the winter, hopefully.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.300
This will be a lot
of trade goods.

12:45.333 --> 12:47.067
This will be stuff
we can give away as gifts.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.433
This is a really good
place to be.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.433
And the reason why we make
so much effort to get here

12:50.467 --> 12:52.933
is because it's going
to be here. Stuff is here.

12:52.967 --> 12:54.533
We'll never stop coming here.

12:54.567 --> 12:56.667
It's a great place.
The breeze is here,
the weather is here.

12:56.700 --> 12:58.233
This is just like
a perfect combo.

12:58.267 --> 13:02.767
It all comes together for,
hopefully, some good smoking.

13:02.800 --> 13:05.167
We just got the net in,
hopefully there's going
to be a lot of fish.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.167
The next tide, we'll see.
You don't know
until they're in the net.

13:10.467 --> 13:13.967
This is going to be the part
that collects the smoke up.

13:14.067 --> 13:16.067
It's going to be smoking
end of the deal.

13:16.100 --> 13:18.367
So I've got it to where I can
slow down the wind

13:18.400 --> 13:20.067
as much as possible
and allow the smoke

13:20.067 --> 13:22.100
to gather before shooting out
the other side.

13:23.533 --> 13:25.567
So, I'm just blocking it
all up except for the bottom.

13:25.600 --> 13:28.067
The bottom will provide
a continuous breeze
through there,

13:28.067 --> 13:30.467
even when the smoke is off.

13:30.500 --> 13:32.433
Most of the time while
it's smoking,
we'll keep it shut.

13:32.467 --> 13:34.433
When it stops smoking,
and it's night,
time to go to sleep,

13:34.467 --> 13:37.500
we'll open it up
and just let the breeze
blow on through.

13:37.533 --> 13:39.933
It's important to have it
facing the right direction,

13:39.967 --> 13:42.400
'cause, uh, you want to have
the wind to do it properly.

13:42.433 --> 13:44.267
So, if a north wind comes,
a west wind comes,

13:44.300 --> 13:47.133
either way is fine with me.
It's going to work out.
And we want the breeze.

13:47.167 --> 13:50.233
The breeze dries the meat,
dries the fish,
keeps the mosquitoes away.

13:50.267 --> 13:52.300
This is all good.
This is all aligned properly.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.233
This is going to get, to be
really good drying done,

13:54.267 --> 13:57.067
some really good
smoking done,
get some good fish done.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.533
The smokehouse is done.

13:59.567 --> 14:01.733
I've got the stove, wherever
the wind is coming from.

14:01.767 --> 14:04.633
Once I've got the fish
put in there,
I can move the stove around.

14:04.667 --> 14:07.133
But now all I really need
to do is just
go check the net.

14:07.167 --> 14:09.133
I'm going to have to put
a few hours into cutting fish,

14:09.167 --> 14:11.400
then I'll set some smoke
on them and go to bed.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.367
Going to be a full rack
of fish here soon.

14:16.367 --> 14:19.533
ANDY: Glass half full
is way better
than a glass half empty.

14:19.567 --> 14:23.300
And, uh, that's the way
we like to look
at life out here.

14:23.333 --> 14:25.267
That's what living out here
is all about.

14:37.300 --> 14:41.133
NARRATOR: A break
in the weather allows
Andy to continue his work.

14:42.200 --> 14:46.100
But with winter looming,
each day is critical.

14:49.067 --> 14:50.800
That's going to work.

14:53.133 --> 14:55.700
Finally got a clear day,
so I'm going to go like hell

14:55.733 --> 14:59.500
and try to get as much
sanding done today,
as I possibly can,

14:59.533 --> 15:01.900
'cause I don't know
when I'm going to get
another clear day,

15:01.933 --> 15:04.800
and the sanding is the part
that takes the most time

15:04.833 --> 15:09.600
and it's by far
the most critical thing
of this whole process.

15:09.633 --> 15:13.567
Yesterday, I ran into
a lot of problems
when it started raining.

15:13.600 --> 15:17.733
As soon as the sander
clogs up, it just starts
burning into the wood

15:17.767 --> 15:21.133
and that makes a pretty
unsightly scar in the wood.

15:21.167 --> 15:23.300
I've got some coarser
sanding disks,

15:23.333 --> 15:25.700
which I'm hoping is going
to speed the process up.

15:25.733 --> 15:28.067
It's going to make
it to where it cuts
a lot quicker.

15:28.067 --> 15:30.233
It's a little bit coarse
for what I really want,

15:30.267 --> 15:33.333
but at this point in time,
beggars can't be choosers.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.333
I've got a good day
of weather today.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.633
I don't know if I'm going
to have any more good days.

15:41.833 --> 15:43.633
All right,
let's hope this works.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.067
When I go to do a job,

15:47.067 --> 15:49.600
I want to be able to get in,
get the job done,
and move on to the next one

15:49.633 --> 15:51.300
'cause the list
is long right now,

15:51.333 --> 15:54.467
and the days are short,
so everything's coming
to a head,

15:54.500 --> 15:58.067
and there's a definitive
timeline, and that's winter.

15:59.067 --> 16:01.067
Feels pretty good.

16:01.067 --> 16:03.433
Last thing I want to do
is take a tumble.

16:05.933 --> 16:08.333
I don't have full-blown
scaffolding around.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.933
Quite frankly,
I'd have a hard time
putting it up by myself,

16:10.967 --> 16:12.667
it's generally a two-man job.

16:14.267 --> 16:16.967
I have to keep things light.
I have to keep them mobile.

16:17.067 --> 16:18.500
I have to be able
to do it by myself

16:18.533 --> 16:21.067
and I want to be able
to do it fairly quickly.

16:22.967 --> 16:25.933
The last thing I want to do
is spend an hour setting
scaffolding up

16:25.967 --> 16:27.433
for five minutes'
worth of work.

16:29.233 --> 16:31.400
That's gonna be
a million dollar sanding job

16:31.433 --> 16:34.067
here by the time I go
through all these disks.

16:51.367 --> 16:54.100
What I do is not something
I'd ask someone else to do.

16:54.133 --> 16:57.300
I've done it, I'm used to it.
I know what I'm doing.

17:00.067 --> 17:02.400
All the ground around
the house is a little
bit uneven.

17:02.433 --> 17:04.333
It slopes away
from the house to drain.

17:04.367 --> 17:08.767
That makes putting up ladders
a little bit tenuous at times.

17:08.800 --> 17:12.933
An injury out here
is a lot different
than an injury in town.

17:12.967 --> 17:15.267
There's no 911.
There's no ambulance.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.400
There's nobody to come
in with a backboard.

17:26.367 --> 17:29.367
This ain't gonna
fuckin' work at all!

17:29.400 --> 17:31.600
When winter hits,
everything stops.

17:33.900 --> 17:36.967
If you didn't get it done,
you wait another year
to get it done.

17:37.067 --> 17:40.433
There's a ticking clock
going off in my head.

17:40.467 --> 17:43.067
Shortcuts are
seldom shortcuts.

17:45.733 --> 17:46.867
Lesson learned.

17:46.900 --> 17:50.067
I've only got a 10-inch
board that I'm
walking around on.

17:50.067 --> 17:52.300
So you've gotta
pay attention to where
you're putting your feet.

17:52.333 --> 17:57.433
One step the wrong way,
one loss of your balance
and it's a long hard fall.

17:58.700 --> 18:01.267
The stain I'm gonna
use on the cabin.

18:01.300 --> 18:03.533
I don't want to move my
scaffolding a bunch of times,

18:03.567 --> 18:07.100
so I think I'm just
going to sand and stain,
and sand and stain.

18:08.833 --> 18:11.300
Let's see what happens.

18:11.333 --> 18:15.400
It feels good to get
some stain on it, and get
this place closed in.

18:15.433 --> 18:18.733
I'm really worried
about weather getting
in on my insulation

18:18.767 --> 18:20.633
that's in between these walls.

18:20.667 --> 18:23.667
It's not the most
glamorous job in the world,
but it's an essential job.

18:28.267 --> 18:30.067
Man, this is almost done

18:30.067 --> 18:31.833
and that's a good
feeling right now.

18:31.867 --> 18:35.967
The idea for this house
is to make it as completely
weather proof,

18:36.067 --> 18:39.300
completely efficient
as I possibly can.

18:39.333 --> 18:42.167
By the time
this stain wears out,

18:42.200 --> 18:44.933
I'll be burbot bait in
the bottom of the Yukon.

18:44.967 --> 18:47.167
A sauna's gonna
feel good tonight.

18:49.100 --> 18:51.067
That was a long day.

18:51.067 --> 18:53.733
I'm not getting any
younger every day so

18:53.767 --> 18:56.667
every summer is probably
going to be pretty full for me

18:56.700 --> 19:00.067
for the next year or two until
we get this house completed.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.600
ERIK: The lifestyle
that I get to live up here

19:08.633 --> 19:12.333
as a hunting guide
and a subsistence hunter
and trapper is pretty unique

19:12.367 --> 19:14.167
and there's a lot of work
associated with it,

19:14.200 --> 19:17.133
but I think that there's more
pros than cons.

19:23.067 --> 19:26.067
-Oh, yeah, this is pretty
good right here.
-MARTHA: Yeah.

19:26.067 --> 19:28.200
NARRATOR: After ditching
their boat for dry land,

19:28.233 --> 19:32.933
Erik and Martha change
strategies in their quest
to harvest food.

19:32.967 --> 19:36.600
Depending on the conditions,
we use boats,
we use four wheelers.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.067
We use our feet.

19:38.067 --> 19:42.700
And sometimes we sit and call,
other times,
we spot and stalk ducks.

19:42.733 --> 19:45.200
You got an empty shell?

19:45.233 --> 19:48.433
You want to make
a call out of one?

19:52.067 --> 19:55.667
Might be too windy.
Oh, you got it?

19:55.700 --> 19:58.400
MARTHA: I took
a shotgun shell,
and burned a hole into it,

19:58.433 --> 20:01.133
and it makes a very
simple goose call.

20:01.167 --> 20:05.633
I've actually tried it before,
and only been
successful a few times.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.167
It's really hard to do.

20:08.467 --> 20:10.333
(CALL WHISTLING)

20:17.333 --> 20:19.600
ERIK: Maybe the...
You better practise some more.

20:36.433 --> 20:37.433
(GUNSHOT)

20:40.067 --> 20:42.400
I'm kind of sick
of sitting here.

20:42.433 --> 20:44.100
You want to go
and try to stalk up

20:44.133 --> 20:46.100
some of those birds
that landed over there?

20:48.500 --> 20:52.367
Let's just walk
in the woods and see
what comes our way.

20:55.033 --> 20:58.367
SUE: It's a calculated risk
every time you
step out the door.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.700
There's no guarantees
in anything.

21:00.733 --> 21:04.267
The only guarantee is it's a,
you know, it's a limited
time engagement,

21:04.300 --> 21:06.767
so why not pack it
full of experiences.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.300
NARRATOR: Sue has shut down
her main generator

21:26.333 --> 21:28.767
to find the source
of the breakdown.

21:28.800 --> 21:32.667
Without it, she has
no direct contact
with inbound planes,

21:32.700 --> 21:35.533
and clients in camp
are without power.

21:35.567 --> 21:38.433
SUE: Best-case scenario,
something that I can
fix very easily

21:38.467 --> 21:39.967
with something,
with things I have here.

21:40.067 --> 21:42.400
Worst-case scenario is,
it's toast.

21:45.600 --> 21:48.100
The longer I have it down,
my freezers are shut down,

21:48.133 --> 21:51.067
people here
aren't getting heat,
there's no communications.

21:51.067 --> 21:52.433
I can't run a lot
of my equipment.

21:52.467 --> 21:55.167
You've got to find
the problem and fix it.

21:55.200 --> 21:59.700
The generator is the
heartbeat of the camp,

21:59.733 --> 22:05.400
to be able to have lights,
heat, services in your
quarters, hot showers.

22:05.433 --> 22:07.133
All of that
magically disappears

22:07.167 --> 22:09.300
if I don't have energy
to run that kind of a system.

22:09.333 --> 22:11.400
That cuts into
my profit margin.

22:11.433 --> 22:14.233
If I go into red,
you know, red is dead.

22:14.267 --> 22:16.933
Okay, this isn't good.

22:16.967 --> 22:18.133
I have got a problem.

22:18.567 --> 22:19.733
That's not good.

22:20.733 --> 22:22.467
You've got oil over here.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.367
You've got little fuzzies.
Everything will stick to it.

22:24.400 --> 22:27.367
When it sticks to that,
it's like creating
your own carpet.

22:27.400 --> 22:30.200
The oil gets on there
in the back of the fan.

22:30.233 --> 22:32.267
Any piece of fuzz,
any piece of dust,

22:32.300 --> 22:34.267
any anything
is going to get stuck.

22:34.300 --> 22:37.733
And now air can
no longer pass through
to cool things off.

22:39.067 --> 22:40.867
That's not good.

22:40.900 --> 22:43.300
That tells me that there
might be a seal blown.

22:43.333 --> 22:46.233
I can take all of this off,
this bracketry, clean it,

22:46.267 --> 22:49.767
pressure wash it, whatever,
get that cleaned up.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.567
Clean everything else
around it.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.800
Pull the radiator hose,
bottom, top.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.133
Come on, you fuckin' prick.

23:02.967 --> 23:04.667
This is our problem.

23:04.700 --> 23:08.167
Oil leaking somewhere
gets flung through the fan

23:08.200 --> 23:09.667
onto the back of the radiator.

23:09.700 --> 23:13.067
Any dust, any dirt,
of which there's a lot here,

23:13.067 --> 23:15.700
any of the tundra cotton,

23:15.733 --> 23:19.600
that's mostly what this is,
gets flung onto
that oil and blocks it.

23:20.367 --> 23:22.600
It can't breathe through this.

23:22.633 --> 23:25.667
What I just scraped off,
there's your fins.

23:25.700 --> 23:27.367
The air has to pass from here

23:27.400 --> 23:32.267
through that to cool down
the radiator fluid,
which cools your engine.

23:32.300 --> 23:35.133
When it's like this,

23:35.167 --> 23:37.867
there's no danger any air
is getting through to cool it,

23:37.900 --> 23:42.700
so you're sending
hot anti-freeze
through a hot engine.

23:42.733 --> 23:43.967
It's a recipe for disaster.

23:44.067 --> 23:47.067
So the machine
will shut itself off,
which it was doing,

23:47.100 --> 23:49.100
and only a fool
keeps it running,

23:49.133 --> 23:53.167
so, just have to do
our best to clean it out.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.633
Um, we're going
to give it a diesel bath

23:55.667 --> 23:57.367
and, uh, get it clean.

24:01.067 --> 24:04.567
The cost of replacing it,
you know, 50,000 to
70,000 to buy it.

24:04.600 --> 24:07.467
Anywhere 5,000 to
20,000 to ship it.

24:07.500 --> 24:09.400
So you're talking
a $100,000 mistake

24:09.433 --> 24:11.567
if you don't catch
your mistake right away.

24:13.500 --> 24:16.200
Where it was
all crappy and creepy,

24:16.233 --> 24:18.400
now you can see
all those fins.

24:18.433 --> 24:20.800
Now, it's not a perfect job,

24:20.833 --> 24:24.500
but you don't
catch the problem,
it's going to catch you.

24:28.567 --> 24:30.633
CHIP: Truthfully,
every day is different.

24:30.667 --> 24:34.133
It's half of what enthrals
me about this lifestyle.

24:34.167 --> 24:36.100
I never have
the same day twice.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.533
There's no
Groundhog Day out here.

24:50.367 --> 24:54.533
-Look, the fishes. Ooh.
-Wow, yep. That's moving.

24:54.567 --> 24:56.433
Summer's coming to an end.
When we can see stars again,

24:56.467 --> 24:58.867
which will happen
in the next few days,
summer is over.

24:58.900 --> 25:00.700
NARRATOR: The end of summer
is also the end

25:00.733 --> 25:04.067
of the Hailstone
family's stay in Kiwalik.

25:04.100 --> 25:06.233
Today, they will pull
their net from the river

25:06.267 --> 25:10.600
in hopes of one
last salmon haul
before winter arrives.

25:10.633 --> 25:12.467
I think today, we're going
to pull the entire net out.

25:12.500 --> 25:14.100
We're gonna lay it right here.
My wife will be able

25:14.133 --> 25:15.767
to work on the net
and I'm gonna cut fish.

25:19.300 --> 25:21.100
CHIP: Time to get some
fish out here.

25:21.133 --> 25:22.967
Carol, you get on
the side with your mum.

25:23.067 --> 25:25.567
Qutan, you help me on my side.
I'm going take the lead line,
you take the top line.

25:25.600 --> 25:28.433
The net is coming up on
this side right here, kids.

25:28.467 --> 25:30.133
We're going to work
it right over here, okay?

25:34.100 --> 25:38.400
You pull gently.
You don't pull real hard.
You pull gently and firmly.

25:42.233 --> 25:44.800
-AGNES: Hee!
-Any more?

25:44.833 --> 25:46.700
Little more, eh? One more.

25:56.900 --> 25:59.567
This is a zombie fish here.
This one is spawned out.

25:59.600 --> 26:02.500
See these teeth on the fish?
They can rip up
the net really bad.

26:02.533 --> 26:04.133
They can poke
holes in your skin,

26:04.167 --> 26:06.133
and this guy right here
has already spawned.

26:13.067 --> 26:15.900
AGNES: Ow! The fish just
jumped and bit me.

26:15.933 --> 26:18.900
Be careful.
This fish is alive
and I tried to grab it

26:18.933 --> 26:21.367
and it just tried
to bite my finger.

26:23.833 --> 26:26.467
Watch out for
the teeth, girls.
They're real sharp.

26:31.133 --> 26:32.300
Carol, when you're
standing there,

26:32.333 --> 26:34.067
waiting for somebody
to take a fish off

26:34.067 --> 26:36.400
you have to try to clean
or untangle the net.

26:36.433 --> 26:38.300
CHIP: It's a good feeling
to provide for my family

26:38.333 --> 26:41.233
and it's a good feeling
to show my family how
to provide for themselves.

26:41.267 --> 26:42.600
And that's really my goal.

26:42.633 --> 26:44.300
I want my children
to live a good life,

26:44.333 --> 26:46.533
and I want to take them along,
and not just tell
them about it,

26:46.567 --> 26:49.400
or let them read about it.
I want them
to participate in it.

26:49.433 --> 26:51.167
AGNES: This is a good one.

26:52.900 --> 26:54.067
CHIP: There's
a hole right there.

26:54.067 --> 26:55.700
This fish has taken
a small hole,

26:55.733 --> 26:58.300
and with his teeth,
and his thrashing and
wrapping himself up like that,

26:58.333 --> 26:59.733
look what he's
done to the net.

26:59.767 --> 27:02.367
So it only makes
the holes bigger,
and fish will do that.

27:02.400 --> 27:03.833
They just want to escape.

27:03.867 --> 27:05.500
They don't care
about your net.
They hate your net.

27:10.500 --> 27:14.433
-Whee, we've reached the end!
-This is the end.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.067
CHIP: We got enough
to make smoke salmon

27:17.067 --> 27:19.633
so we can have treats
throughout the winter.

27:19.667 --> 27:21.500
It's a really different taste.

27:21.533 --> 27:23.433
When you got the two
different flavours,

27:23.467 --> 27:26.233
you know, you don't
get tired of it.
Variety is the spice of life.

27:26.267 --> 27:28.167
AGNES: Not bad of a catch.

27:30.200 --> 27:33.467
ANDY: Being self-sufficient,
being solitary.

27:33.500 --> 27:36.800
Um, some people think
it's a lonely life.

27:36.833 --> 27:40.133
It's never been
a lonely life for me.
It's exhilarating.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.200
NARRATOR: In order for
Andy to install the windows

27:54.233 --> 27:57.133
that will shield their cabin
from the brutal freeze,

27:57.167 --> 28:01.667
he must travel 15 miles
up the Yukon
to their storage in Eagle.

28:04.067 --> 28:06.067
You want to walk
backwards or you
want me to walk?

28:06.067 --> 28:07.800
I can walk.

28:07.833 --> 28:10.067
ANDY: We were
fortunate in that
we were able to tear down

28:10.067 --> 28:13.867
a few buildings during
the flood and salvage
some of the materials.

28:13.900 --> 28:15.567
When I was tearing down
those materials,

28:15.600 --> 28:17.233
I was thinking
about this house,

28:17.267 --> 28:20.500
and how I was going
to be able to use those
materials in our home.

28:20.533 --> 28:22.900
I'm always nervous
when I'm moving glass.

28:22.933 --> 28:24.333
It's really heavy,

28:24.367 --> 28:27.767
and this has all been sitting
outside for four or five years

28:27.800 --> 28:30.433
and there's a lot of moss,
and it's kind of
slippery and slimy,

28:30.467 --> 28:32.400
so it's a little hard
to hold on to.

28:34.067 --> 28:36.600
These are the atrium windows.

28:36.633 --> 28:40.067
There's a lot of handling
involved and every time
we handle something,

28:40.067 --> 28:42.100
all it takes is one trip,
one fall,

28:42.133 --> 28:45.700
and we're back up
in Eagle trying to pick up
some more windows.

28:46.900 --> 28:48.367
Probably...

28:48.400 --> 28:50.933
I mean, these were salvaged,
we got them out of the hotel

28:50.967 --> 28:52.600
that got destroyed
by the flood.

28:52.633 --> 28:54.167
I'm guessing
something like this,

28:54.200 --> 28:57.267
probably 300, 400
bucks a window here.

29:04.067 --> 29:08.333
Why don't you get out?
I'm going to back down right
beside the anchor there.

29:14.433 --> 29:16.433
Don't crack that thing in two.

29:16.467 --> 29:17.833
If these things slide
through your hands,

29:17.867 --> 29:19.867
they're going to slice right
through that leather glove

29:19.900 --> 29:22.867
like a razor knife
through butter.

29:22.900 --> 29:25.667
There's a lot of different
things that could go wrong.

29:25.700 --> 29:28.233
The last thing
I want right now
is badly cut hands

29:28.267 --> 29:31.333
or completely
shattered windows.

29:35.267 --> 29:37.400
Kate, could you
please grab the boat?

29:37.433 --> 29:40.633
-Yeah.
-Damn, you're going
to break the glass.

29:40.667 --> 29:41.933
No, I'm not.

29:41.967 --> 29:43.633
Look at how it's
sitting on the edge.

29:43.667 --> 29:45.067
I know, I was trying
to correct that.

29:45.100 --> 29:48.367
Move the boat forward,
please, like it was.

29:52.167 --> 29:53.467
Right here?

29:54.733 --> 29:57.400
Can't fuckin'...

29:57.433 --> 30:01.433
It slid there on its own
when it got off the boat.

30:04.833 --> 30:06.300
(ANDY GRUMBLING)

30:11.533 --> 30:14.600
Will you take that glass out
of there, that Plexiglas out?

30:17.633 --> 30:21.667
The window had slid
a little bit and edges
were grinding on edges,

30:21.700 --> 30:24.867
and I was
waiting to hear a big crack.

30:24.900 --> 30:28.167
Bottom line is this house
has to be weathered in
for this winter.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.900
Putting these projects off
until fall time is always
really stressful.

30:31.933 --> 30:34.200
I really don't like
it when I have
these projects that have

30:34.233 --> 30:37.933
to get done that
they get put off
until the end of the season.

30:37.967 --> 30:41.067
Better hurry up, we've got
some big black clouds
moving in.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.633
ANDY: I'll measure them up,
do some milling,
do some cutting.

30:44.667 --> 30:47.000
Hopefully, we can
set these windows

30:47.033 --> 30:49.733
and that'll be a big
step in closing up our house.

30:53.167 --> 30:56.233
SUE: Life can surprise me by
showing me my wall

30:56.267 --> 30:59.867
and reminding me
not to get too proud
and too full of myself.

30:59.900 --> 31:04.367
I am pleased that I still have
a mind that can come up with
the ingenuity of,

31:04.400 --> 31:06.333
"Yeah, so I can't do
it your way...

31:07.700 --> 31:09.400
"But I can do it this way."

31:16.833 --> 31:21.067
NARRATOR: Sue has cleaned
the debris causing
her generator to fail,

31:21.067 --> 31:23.167
but before she can fire it up,

31:23.200 --> 31:25.467
a new problem
stands in the way.

31:26.900 --> 31:28.700
There's a big crack there.

31:28.733 --> 31:30.433
Bum deal.

31:30.467 --> 31:35.533
So now my exhaust is not
going where it needs to go,
it's floofing everywhere.

31:35.567 --> 31:37.433
That's not the way
you want it.

31:37.467 --> 31:41.233
You want a solid piece
of tubing going
to the outside world and gone.

31:41.267 --> 31:43.967
So I want to cut it here,
pull this end out.

31:44.067 --> 31:47.067
Pull this out of the way,
slide that in, and see
what we need.

31:47.067 --> 31:49.533
Because it all
matches together.
You know, it's...

31:49.567 --> 31:51.467
All right, so you just want
to cut that off?

31:51.500 --> 31:52.933
Yeah, yeah.
We'll cut it to length.

31:52.967 --> 31:54.467
We'll cut everything
to length once you see
what we need...

31:54.500 --> 31:56.900
All right.
What I'm going to do,
cut it, marry it,

31:56.933 --> 31:58.333
make a new joint.

31:58.367 --> 32:01.167
It's always good to have
a backup. I currently
don't have one.

32:01.200 --> 32:04.233
Luckily, these are pieces
and parts out
of the bone yard.

32:04.267 --> 32:10.100
Bone yard is an area
of currently
non-usable parts,

32:10.133 --> 32:12.533
but it is something, you know,

32:12.567 --> 32:16.067
you hear me say here
and there, repurposing.

32:16.067 --> 32:18.400
By itself, it's not
a usable piece.

32:18.433 --> 32:20.600
By itself, it's too short
to do me much good.

32:20.633 --> 32:22.267
Together, it can
be a solution.

32:24.067 --> 32:25.433
-Got it?
-Yeah.

32:29.600 --> 32:30.600
Oh, yeah.

32:38.433 --> 32:42.700
The most important tool
that you can have out here
for this lifestyle,

32:42.733 --> 32:46.200
that's your mind,
your creativity,
your ingenuity,

32:46.233 --> 32:48.700
and your ability to improvise.

32:48.733 --> 32:49.833
Ta-da.

32:49.867 --> 32:52.567
Changed out the exhaust pipe,

32:52.600 --> 32:55.600
you know, cut it,
made a tundra fix.

32:55.633 --> 32:58.067
Um, it is time to get
this thing kicked over

32:58.100 --> 33:00.933
and see what it's going to do.

33:00.967 --> 33:03.067
ERIK: I came to Alaska
as a teenager.

33:03.067 --> 33:05.167
I was in search
of a sense of adventure,

33:05.200 --> 33:07.800
and free and open places,
and wilderness.

33:08.967 --> 33:11.067
I guess I found it.

33:21.067 --> 33:24.500
NARRATOR: Erik and Martha
are stalking the woods
along the Newhalen River

33:24.533 --> 33:29.767
to harvest waterfowl
before the birds migrate south
for the winter.

33:29.800 --> 33:34.933
ERIK: All the meat that I eat
in my household is meat
that either I harvested myself

33:34.967 --> 33:37.533
or meat that's recycled
to me via my hunters

33:37.567 --> 33:40.233
that I guide
every spring and fall.

33:40.267 --> 33:42.067
You know that's not
an unlimited resource up here.

33:42.067 --> 33:45.167
You got to realise
that these animals
need to be respected,

33:45.200 --> 33:48.633
and that you need
to really be careful about
how many you harvest

33:48.667 --> 33:52.433
and what you do harvest,
you should use
to the fullest capacity.

33:57.833 --> 33:59.867
ERIK: It's fish.

33:59.900 --> 34:02.133
Shit load of them over there.

34:04.067 --> 34:05.567
MARTHA: Bird hunting
is not easy.

34:05.600 --> 34:07.433
It's different than caribou
or moose.

34:07.467 --> 34:10.667
So when the season comes,
it's really exciting to shoot
that first duck

34:10.700 --> 34:12.233
or first goose and eat it.

34:13.600 --> 34:14.633
There's some out there.

34:27.800 --> 34:30.067
(ERIK WHISPERING)

34:35.333 --> 34:36.333
Okay.

34:44.900 --> 34:46.100
(ERIK WHISPERING)

35:24.600 --> 35:25.600
(ERIK SPEAKING)

35:30.400 --> 35:33.400
MARTHA: Where'd it go?
Is it still alive?

35:35.967 --> 35:37.133
There it is.

35:41.967 --> 35:43.333
Who got it, you think?

35:43.367 --> 35:45.267
Who cares? Let's go home
and eat it. You going
to make soup?

35:45.300 --> 35:47.600
-Yeah, I'll make some soup.
-Nice, let's go home.

35:49.533 --> 35:51.867
I'm going to head home,
and I'm going to have

35:51.900 --> 35:53.867
some fresh duck, nice and fat.

35:53.900 --> 35:57.433
We're going to chow
down on some
delicious table fare, so.

35:57.467 --> 36:02.233
Go home, clean up these birds
and call it a day.

36:07.100 --> 36:09.133
ANDY: My visions
are always big.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.400
My plate is always full.

36:11.433 --> 36:14.433
But that's what I wake up
every morning really liking.

36:14.467 --> 36:16.267
If I had nothing
to do around here,

36:16.300 --> 36:18.167
I would get bored
pretty quick.

36:32.467 --> 36:35.267
ANDY: Double check that
and make sure
that's going to fit.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.533
NARRATOR: Today,
Andy and Kate
will install the windows

36:37.567 --> 36:39.400
in their new cabin,

36:39.433 --> 36:43.900
to ensure their dream home
will be able to endure
the brutal winter months.

36:43.933 --> 36:48.933
ANDY: This is a super
sticky material so it will
seal this window

36:48.967 --> 36:50.333
right into place here.

36:50.367 --> 36:52.733
So whenever this window
touches it, that's it.

36:52.767 --> 36:55.267
That's where it's going to be.

36:55.300 --> 36:57.700
Hold on, I've got
to get my fingers out.

36:59.600 --> 37:02.733
-That should do it.
-Look at that, real glass.

37:07.633 --> 37:09.067
Yay.

37:09.067 --> 37:12.067
One window done,
three to go today.

37:15.967 --> 37:20.333
So I've got to get this done
so he can get on with
the getting the windows in.

37:20.367 --> 37:23.267
This kind of little jobs
I don't mind doing.

37:23.300 --> 37:25.933
It's getting me closer
to getting me into
my new house.

37:25.967 --> 37:27.133
(CHUCKLING)

37:30.733 --> 37:32.967
ANDY: I love doing
all the things
I do around here.

37:33.067 --> 37:35.833
I get up every morning,
and I do what I want to do

37:35.867 --> 37:40.267
and I don't know
too many people that have
that ability to say

37:40.300 --> 37:42.100
that that's the way
their life is.

37:42.133 --> 37:43.533
Now, that's a kitchen window.

37:45.500 --> 37:48.700
I'm feeling pretty good
about going into winter
with the project now.

37:48.733 --> 37:52.067
The, uh, house is sanded,
stained, the windows are in.

37:53.367 --> 37:56.467
None too soon,
the colours are changing
really quick.

37:56.500 --> 38:00.433
We've had frost,
and, uh, we've had snow
on the tops of the mountains,

38:00.467 --> 38:03.200
so, kind of, got it done
in the nick of time.

38:03.233 --> 38:05.167
Now it's time
to go fishing and hunting.

38:09.100 --> 38:12.633
SUE: You have to be dead nuts
about who you are,

38:12.667 --> 38:14.867
what you want out of life,
and how the hell
you're going to get it.

38:14.900 --> 38:18.333
You better have both hands
on the pistol and ready
to aim and shoot.

38:28.500 --> 38:32.067
All right, so, took apart
the radiator guards,

38:32.067 --> 38:33.533
cleaned the radiator,

38:34.167 --> 38:35.733
degreased the radiator.

38:35.767 --> 38:38.800
It is time to get this thing
kicked over and see

38:38.833 --> 38:40.067
what it's going to do.

38:40.067 --> 38:43.067
Green, yellow.

38:44.167 --> 38:46.100
Cross your fingers.

38:48.067 --> 38:49.267
(SPUTTERING)

38:49.300 --> 38:50.500
That don't sound good.

38:50.533 --> 38:52.500
-(GENERATOR TURNING OVER)
-There we go.

38:52.533 --> 38:57.500
There it goes.
Well, you can see
that the wind is blowing now.

38:57.533 --> 38:59.100
Before, it wasn't.

38:59.133 --> 39:02.733
We got wind coming out
which means that it's cold.

39:02.767 --> 39:07.667
So that means it's cooling
down the radiator fluid
again. Yay.

39:12.167 --> 39:14.700
And I'm right in the middle
of making sure the gen
is back up,

39:14.733 --> 39:16.933
and you can see,
I've got planes everywhere.

39:16.967 --> 39:18.833
They need to be able
to talk to me.

39:18.867 --> 39:21.067
This guy's been waiting
so I can get a break

39:21.067 --> 39:23.233
to get the fuel
done so he can get in the air.

39:23.267 --> 39:26.733
So, I mean, it's just all one
big, happy family, man.

39:26.767 --> 39:28.100
-You ready to rock?
-Yep.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.333
So, yeah, thanks
for being patient
with the generator.

39:32.367 --> 39:34.233
But at least now,
I'll have air-to-ground.

39:34.267 --> 39:36.233
-We got power,
I'm smiling.
-Yeah.

39:36.267 --> 39:37.933
Planes only make money
when they're in the air,

39:37.967 --> 39:41.233
but I only get money from them
when they get on the ground
and get fuel.

39:41.267 --> 39:43.700
If we can't communicate
to each other,
it's a safety issue,

39:43.733 --> 39:46.767
but it's also
a monetary issue
for both of us.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.700
-All right, is that going
to do it?
-That's absolutely.

39:48.733 --> 39:50.367
All right, $25.90.

39:50.400 --> 39:52.400
Fly safe,
I'll see you later on.

39:54.733 --> 39:57.933
Once D gets airborne,
I'll do a radio check
with him.

39:57.967 --> 39:59.667
He can hear me,
I can hear him.

39:59.700 --> 40:01.667
Then I'm totally back online.

40:03.200 --> 40:05.133
You got a copy on Kavik here?

40:05.700 --> 40:08.000
(D SPEAKING OVER RADIO)

40:08.033 --> 40:10.433
All right,
you have a good day,

40:10.467 --> 40:13.600
fly safe, and thanks for being
patient on the genny.

40:13.633 --> 40:14.733
(D SPEAKING)

40:14.767 --> 40:16.633
I just got confirmation
it's working.

40:16.667 --> 40:20.233
Lights are on,
water's pumping,
back in business.

40:23.300 --> 40:26.467
CHIP: The whole essence
of subsistence is to be able
to go in your local,

40:26.500 --> 40:30.233
immediate area, utilise
the materials around you,
and have a good life.

40:30.267 --> 40:31.633
And that's all we're up to.

40:45.300 --> 40:48.200
I want to make these ones
into strips.

40:48.233 --> 40:51.233
Mom, I have a cut right there,
but I want to cut fish.

40:51.267 --> 40:52.367
Nope.

40:53.300 --> 40:55.433
You'll get an infection.

40:55.467 --> 40:57.467
CHIP: With this pulling
of the net, we're going
to have a full rack,

40:57.500 --> 41:00.200
and the full rack is also
gonna mean that we're
gonna have a full boat.

41:00.233 --> 41:03.367
So if we want to not
only to get it done right,
but we want to take it home,

41:03.400 --> 41:05.600
we, kind of, gotta
limit ourselves
to what we got today.

41:07.333 --> 41:09.200
Another good fishing season.

41:09.233 --> 41:10.500
CHIP: Yup, it sure is.

41:10.533 --> 41:12.300
This looks like a good final
amount to smoke.

41:12.333 --> 41:16.767
If we had to have
a last amount of fish at all,
you couldn't get it better.

41:16.800 --> 41:18.833
Oh, we always have
productive summers
when we come down here,

41:18.867 --> 41:20.200
and that's why
we come down here,

41:20.233 --> 41:21.567
and why we've been down here
for more than 20 years.

41:26.533 --> 41:28.567
Cutting and processing your
own fish has always been

41:28.600 --> 41:31.267
a really important resource
up here.

41:31.300 --> 41:33.300
Because if you've got
salmon, you've got wealth.

41:33.333 --> 41:36.633
That's energy, that's food,
that's trade material.

41:36.667 --> 41:37.667
That's the good stuff.

41:39.833 --> 41:42.867
AGNES: This has no salt in it,
and we just pretty much use it

41:42.900 --> 41:45.133
to clean all the blood
and stuff off of it,

41:45.167 --> 41:47.067
and then we put
them in this one,

41:47.067 --> 41:49.867
and this is, um,
for salting and smoking.

41:49.900 --> 41:51.533
So this one has
salt water in it

41:51.567 --> 41:55.667
and, uh, this is just
regular water,
just wash and rinse

41:55.700 --> 41:57.433
and then we just
go hang them up,

41:57.467 --> 42:00.633
and they'll
just be non-salted,
but slightly smoked.

42:01.167 --> 42:02.667
Almost done.

42:02.700 --> 42:04.633
Good haul, eh? Just right.

42:08.333 --> 42:09.933
CHIP: I want to put them
up in the smoke,

42:09.967 --> 42:12.600
but for now, for drip-drying,
they need to get
all that salted water

42:12.633 --> 42:14.067
off of them.

42:14.067 --> 42:17.433
-Sure looks good, eh?
-Sure does, sure smells good.

42:17.467 --> 42:23.200
This is going to be real good
snack during the winter until
next salmon fishing season.

42:23.233 --> 42:26.100
We have pinks, chums,
and silvers here.

42:26.133 --> 42:27.967
We don't usually
get silvers back home,

42:28.067 --> 42:31.733
so this is going to be
a real good, different taste
during the winter.

42:34.133 --> 42:36.333
CHIP: All in all, this was
an excellent investment
to come here

42:36.367 --> 42:38.067
and spend the summer
in Kiwalik.

42:38.067 --> 42:41.133
We've just basically
put a couple thousand bucks
into being here,

42:41.167 --> 42:44.967
and I know we're going home
with a vast more amount
in, uh, potential money.

42:45.067 --> 42:47.467
It's got to be a couple
of thousand dollars
worth of fish hanging here.

42:47.500 --> 42:50.067
You can't get skunked
on fishing if you know
what you're doing.

42:50.100 --> 42:51.567
We just don't get skunked.
