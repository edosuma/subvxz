00:01.175 --> 00:03.003
Previously on Supergirl...

00:03.046 --> 00:04.743
The President's
been working
for Lex Luthor.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.658
Lex has a tank.

00:06.702 --> 00:08.182
-All right. All right,
-Tank. Tank. Tank. Tank.
Tank. Tank. Tank. Tank.

00:08.225 --> 00:09.183
It's Supergirl.

00:09.226 --> 00:11.098
Lexie calls her Ryzhaya Dch.

00:11.141 --> 00:12.447
That's "Red Daughter."

00:12.490 --> 00:14.057
Lex has taught her
to hate America.

00:14.101 --> 00:17.234
Lex convinces Kaznia
to invade the US,
betrays them--

00:17.278 --> 00:18.453
And maybe he stops it himself.

00:18.496 --> 00:19.497
You rebooted me.

00:19.541 --> 00:21.282
I'm not going to release you.

00:21.325 --> 00:23.675
Go through the portal. Once you're on the other side,

00:23.719 --> 00:26.243
inform me of the location,
and we'll liberate the camp.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.940
-Starting extraction.
-No!

00:27.984 --> 00:30.682
We don't know what's coming.
I need my strength.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.989
-But you're unstable.
-Then stabilize me!

00:35.905 --> 00:36.775
I remember.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.038
Kara, you can't go!

00:39.169 --> 00:41.084
-I'm here.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.260
I've missed you so much.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.045
...an invasion of our country

00:45.088 --> 00:46.916
by the dangerous
rogue state of Kaznia...

00:46.959 --> 00:50.746
One man thwarted the invaders
and killed the terrorist.

00:50.789 --> 00:53.096
Mr. Luthor,
a grateful nation thanks you.

00:53.140 --> 00:54.097
How did this happen?

01:16.206 --> 01:18.252
Kara Danvers got away.

01:18.295 --> 01:20.297
I failed you.

01:20.341 --> 01:21.864
Oh, Ryzhaya Dch,

01:23.344 --> 01:25.389
you could never fail me.

01:25.433 --> 01:27.043
You asked me to kill her.

01:27.478 --> 01:29.045
You made her bleed.

01:32.440 --> 01:34.616
But still, I should have known

01:34.659 --> 01:38.446
Kryptonite alone could
never kill Kara Danvers.

01:39.273 --> 01:41.666
Her heart, however,

01:41.710 --> 01:45.366
makes her weaker
than Kryptonite ever could.

01:47.672 --> 01:50.153
Go and finish what we started.

02:13.089 --> 02:14.308
Please. Please don't...

02:14.351 --> 02:16.397
Don't worry. It won't hurt.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.355
No...

02:19.661 --> 02:20.792
Guess I was wrong.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.232
Alien energy
transfer complete.

02:25.275 --> 02:26.494
Your gauntlet
should be charged.

02:26.537 --> 02:28.235
Only one way to find out.

02:28.278 --> 02:29.801
Um...

02:29.845 --> 02:32.804
Excuse me, uh,
stand very still.

02:34.241 --> 02:35.590
Argh!

02:35.633 --> 02:36.721
Hmm.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.158
Get a mop.

02:39.463 --> 02:41.291
Didn't we talk about flinching?

02:41.335 --> 02:45.295
No. No, no, it's Otis.
He's dead, again.

02:45.339 --> 02:47.384
Lockwood.

02:47.428 --> 02:48.472
There's nothing I hate more
than a man with the courage
of his convictions.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.431
With the superpowers
to match them.

02:50.474 --> 02:53.390
Now that he's served
his usefulness, we should
take care of him.

02:53.434 --> 02:55.349
Send a team to do it.
Only people you trust.

02:55.392 --> 02:56.959
Yes, Mr. Luthor.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.526
-Eve?
-Hmm?

02:58.569 --> 03:01.485
This country, this planet...

03:02.747 --> 03:05.794
It's nearly ours.
Can you feel it?

03:05.837 --> 03:07.970
Ever since the moment
I met you.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.984
Satellite images confirm

03:22.941 --> 03:25.553
a Kaznian force is
amassing off the coast.

03:28.382 --> 03:30.645
Not that I don't
trust the plan,

03:30.688 --> 03:34.692
but are you sure
I shouldn't be
in a bunker somewhere?

03:34.736 --> 03:39.306
You were a backbench,
backwater senator.

03:39.349 --> 03:43.919
Then I took out Marsdin's
running mate and got you
on the ticket.

03:43.962 --> 03:46.182
Then I brought down
Marsdin, as well.

03:46.226 --> 03:50.404
From zero to Mr. President
with the snap of my fingers.

03:50.447 --> 03:54.712
Are you seriously asking me
if I'm sure about something?

03:56.758 --> 03:58.107
I should have learned by now,

03:58.150 --> 04:00.718
never doubt Lex Luthor.

04:03.547 --> 04:04.853
Relax, Phil.

04:04.896 --> 04:07.508
Soon, Supergirl will be dead.

04:07.551 --> 04:12.817
And you will be America's
beloved, victorious
wartime president.

04:12.861 --> 04:15.298
With more allegiances
and more power

04:15.342 --> 04:18.301
than any president
in the history of the republic.

04:20.434 --> 04:22.566
Well, cheers to that.

04:28.746 --> 04:30.705

Hey.

No. No!

06:34.437 --> 06:36.396
Supergirl is dead.

06:36.439 --> 06:37.397
What happened?

06:37.919 --> 06:39.486
The Kaznians invaded.

06:39.529 --> 06:43.446
Your signal was late.
I was supposed to
lead the attack.

06:43.490 --> 06:48.451
No, Ryzhaya Dch.
You did exactly
what you were meant to do.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.543
You betrayed me.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.763
Betrayed Kaznia.

06:55.806 --> 06:59.070
What can I say?
I'm proud to be an American.

07:04.859 --> 07:07.122
We have
breaking news coming out
of the White House.

07:07.165 --> 07:08.297
Lex Luthor...

07:08.340 --> 07:10.125
I have to stop him.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.996
Kara, you barely escaped
with your life.

07:12.040 --> 07:14.521
And he has a weapon
that killed Red Daughter.

07:14.564 --> 07:16.566
He did experiments
on her in Kaznia.

07:16.610 --> 07:19.787
He knew how to take her down,
but he still needed
Red Daughter to kill me.

07:19.830 --> 07:21.789
You basically died.

07:21.832 --> 07:23.312
But I survived.

07:23.355 --> 07:26.446
And Lex doesn't know that.
That's to my advantage.

07:26.489 --> 07:29.405
Lex and the President
have succeeded
in convincing the people

07:29.449 --> 07:31.189
that all aliens are dangerous.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.061
That Supergirl is the enemy.

07:33.104 --> 07:34.671
And Lex is the hero.

07:34.715 --> 07:37.544
Well, I guess it's my job
to show them who Lex really is.

07:38.675 --> 07:40.111
Show them the truth.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.505
I just fear that the people
won't listen.

07:42.549 --> 07:46.074
No, I will not let fear win.

07:46.117 --> 07:48.729
And with my sister by my side,

07:48.772 --> 07:50.513
anything is possible.

07:58.869 --> 08:00.654
Ryzhaya Dch.

08:04.745 --> 08:07.965
I trusted you, Alex.

08:08.009 --> 08:11.708
You're either dumb
or staggeringly naive.

08:11.752 --> 08:15.538
You had my history
at your disposal.
Internet accessible.

08:15.582 --> 08:19.194
If you had bothered
to look, you'd have
realized two things.

08:19.237 --> 08:23.938
Defending poor, broken Kaznia
is a little small potatoes
for Lex Luthor.

08:23.981 --> 08:26.549
But, perhaps
more significantly,

08:27.028 --> 08:31.598
I hate Kryptonians.

08:32.555 --> 08:35.732
And what are you? A Kryptonian.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.607
You should've let me die.

08:41.651 --> 08:45.612
Die? I have
bigger plans for you.

08:57.232 --> 08:59.626
Otis Graves was found dead.

08:59.669 --> 09:02.498
Next to his body
was a manifesto,
taking detailed credit

09:02.542 --> 09:04.935
for all of Mr. Luthor's crimes.

09:04.979 --> 09:08.939
In light of this new evidence, I have pardoned Mr. Luthor.

09:08.983 --> 09:13.553
I am appointing him the new
Secretary of Alien Affairs.

09:14.423 --> 09:16.251
Because of his heroics today...

09:19.080 --> 09:21.517
...profound knowledge
of everything alien.

09:28.742 --> 09:31.309
Mr. Luthor sends his regards.

09:38.839 --> 09:41.711
Regards, regards, regards,

09:41.755 --> 09:45.062
regards, regards, regards,
regards,

09:45.106 --> 09:48.762
regards, regards,
regards, regards,

09:48.805 --> 09:52.766
regards, regards,
regards, regards, regar...

09:54.071 --> 09:55.638
Sorry, sorry...

09:55.682 --> 09:59.816
Lex Luthor has been
using me for a year.

10:01.862 --> 10:02.906
Why?

10:11.654 --> 10:13.613
I've never seen
anything like this.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.266
Get used to it, stupid.

10:15.310 --> 10:19.009
Mr. Luthor needs stuff
built for his refinery.

10:19.053 --> 10:20.402
Now you can get to work.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.626
Even without
the dampening cuffs,

10:28.018 --> 10:30.151
no powers.

10:30.194 --> 10:32.849
Shelley Island.
The place is surrounded by
power-dampening pylons.

10:32.893 --> 10:36.810
Without my powers,
there's no way I can
send Brainy our location.

10:36.853 --> 10:39.900
Maybe he should've
thought of that
before abandoning us,

10:39.943 --> 10:41.641
like a logical idiot.

10:41.684 --> 10:45.470
Look, I'm not
happy with him, either.
But there are two of us.

10:46.297 --> 10:48.082
A diversion?

10:48.125 --> 10:49.910
Move it!
Get over here!

10:52.042 --> 10:53.043
Al.

10:53.087 --> 10:54.871
If you're going for
a diversion,

10:54.915 --> 10:56.612
count me and my friends in.

10:57.874 --> 11:01.008
We've been waiting
for someone to
lead us out of here.

11:01.051 --> 11:03.575
I should have predicted
it would be you, J'onn J'onzz.

11:06.013 --> 11:08.189
In yet
another stunning display
of magnanimity,

11:08.232 --> 11:12.019
Lex Luthor has donated
an energy source
to help restore electricity

11:12.062 --> 11:13.890
to the thousands of homes
that were affected

11:13.934 --> 11:16.240
by Kaznia's bombing of
the coast's power grid.

11:16.284 --> 11:20.027
The President will
swear Lex Luthor in as
Secretary of Alien Affairs

11:20.070 --> 11:23.204
in a Rose Garden ceremony
scheduled for later
this afternoon.

11:23.247 --> 11:24.596
Hey.

11:25.032 --> 11:26.076
Kara.

11:27.077 --> 11:28.383
I was worried.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.212
I heard the President
tried to silence you.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.953
I'm okay.

11:32.996 --> 11:34.041
Thank God.

11:34.084 --> 11:35.172
And then, Supergirl?

11:35.216 --> 11:37.174
She's alive,
and she's ready to fight.

11:37.218 --> 11:40.961
Brainy, the President had
the Secret Service wipe
all of CatCo's servers,

11:41.004 --> 11:43.485
and I lost all of my evidence.
Can you recover it?

11:44.094 --> 11:45.661
It's already done.

11:46.314 --> 11:47.707
Yes. Yes!

11:47.750 --> 11:50.927
This proves that Lex has been
working with Kaznia,

11:50.971 --> 11:53.016
and he used Red Daughter
to attack the White House.

11:53.060 --> 11:55.845
It also proves that
the government gave Lex
alien prisoners

11:55.889 --> 11:57.281
from the DEO desert facility.

11:57.325 --> 11:59.675
Not just the aliens
from the DEO facility.

11:59.719 --> 12:03.157
J'onn J'onzz, Dreamer, and I
have discovered that Lex
has been transferring

12:03.200 --> 12:05.289
aliens rounded up
by Ben Lockwood

12:05.333 --> 12:07.901
and bringing them to a
private facility, where he's
been siphoning their powers.

12:08.815 --> 12:10.381
My God!

12:10.425 --> 12:12.383
Well, where is this facility?

12:12.427 --> 12:14.081
That information
is forthcoming.

12:14.124 --> 12:15.604
Is that where J'onn
and Dreamer are?

12:15.647 --> 12:17.998
Hopefully.
They have been abducted.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.347
-What?
-Why didn't you tell us that?

12:19.390 --> 12:21.436
Are you serious?

12:21.479 --> 12:24.482
That is a rather strong
emotional reaction for
such an insignificant detail.

12:24.526 --> 12:26.658
Our plan is to save the aliens.

12:26.702 --> 12:30.271
Those aliens will
simply include
J'onn and Dreamer.

12:30.314 --> 12:33.100
Excuse me, Ms. Luthor,
this came for you.

12:33.143 --> 12:34.101
Thank you.

12:40.498 --> 12:41.804
What is it?

12:43.110 --> 12:45.808
It's an invitation
to the White House
from Lex.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.941
Lena, you can't possibly be
thinking of going.

12:47.984 --> 12:50.291
If I don't go, Lex'll
come after the people
I care about,

12:50.334 --> 12:52.728
and I can't have that happen.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.906
Besides, if I see Lex, I'll be
able to get some stellar quotes
for my best friend's article.

12:56.950 --> 12:59.213
Speaking of which, Kara,
you better start typing.

13:15.882 --> 13:17.144
Mother.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.841
Lena.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.669
Can you believe it, sis?

13:20.712 --> 13:22.627
Three Luthors
in the Oval Office.

13:23.715 --> 13:25.543
Only in America.

13:31.201 --> 13:34.552
Let me guess, you're having
the President tied up
in the Treaty Room?

13:34.596 --> 13:37.338
Puppets don't need
to be tied up, Lena.

13:37.381 --> 13:38.861
You just hang them up
by their strings.

13:38.905 --> 13:40.558
Well, why don't you put
a blond wig on the President,

13:40.602 --> 13:42.125
and you can sell him
and Eve as a matching set?

13:42.169 --> 13:45.215
Now, now. You two play nicely.

13:45.259 --> 13:47.522
This is the first
family gathering
we've had in ages,

13:47.565 --> 13:49.437
and I'd like to enjoy myself.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.962
Your murderous son has
duped the world into thinking
he's Earth's hero.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.398
This is hardly
Thanksgiving dinner.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.705
Sounds perfectly normal
for our family.

13:56.748 --> 14:02.058
Why don't we have a cup of tea
while Lex tells us
why he summoned us here?

14:02.102 --> 14:04.060
He summoned us here to gloat.

14:04.104 --> 14:07.020
You think so little of me,
Lena. It hurts.

14:07.585 --> 14:09.892
I'm a sentimental guy.

14:09.936 --> 14:16.072
I didn't do all of this for me,
I did it for us.

14:16.116 --> 14:20.250
I mean, look, we all know
if I wanted you two dead,

14:20.294 --> 14:23.514
you wouldn't be treading
on the presidential seal
having a tea party.

14:23.558 --> 14:29.390
Everything I've done
has been strategic to lead up
to this very moment.

14:29.433 --> 14:32.741
The Luthor name cleared.

14:32.784 --> 14:36.092
Our family poised to take
its rightful place in history.

14:36.136 --> 14:39.182
And what exactly
are we poised to do?

14:41.663 --> 14:44.318
Revolutionize energy worldwide.

14:46.146 --> 14:52.630
I'm rounding up aliens
and harnessing their power
to be used and sold,

14:52.674 --> 14:56.286
sort of like supercharged
disposable batteries.

14:56.330 --> 15:00.377
-That's vile.
-Vile and viable.

15:00.421 --> 15:02.205
As another world leader
once said,

15:02.249 --> 15:05.730
"I don't see why men
shouldn't be
as cruel as nature."

15:05.774 --> 15:11.258
Try not to quote Hitler
in public, dear.
It'll hurt the brand.

15:11.301 --> 15:14.565
You killed Superman's cousin,
took over the country...

15:14.609 --> 15:18.221
What makes you think
he's gonna sit idly by on Argo
and allow this to happen?

15:18.265 --> 15:22.269
Ah, I was hoping you'd bring up
The Man of Yesterday.

15:23.357 --> 15:24.967
The first batch
of depleted aliens

15:25.011 --> 15:26.838
will charge
the satellite weapon

15:26.882 --> 15:30.016
that will turn Argo
into a blazing inferno,

15:30.059 --> 15:34.237
and Superman into, well, ash.

15:34.281 --> 15:36.326
May I speak with you privately?

15:36.370 --> 15:38.459
Excuse me for a moment.

15:38.502 --> 15:41.244
Please enjoy the view
of the South Lawn,

15:41.288 --> 15:45.118
famous for
its egg-rolling contest.

15:53.082 --> 15:54.344
You're not buying this, Mother?

15:54.388 --> 15:58.044
Of course not.
I've already poisoned his tea.

15:58.087 --> 16:00.524
If he'd stopped
running his mouth
long enough to take a sip,

16:00.568 --> 16:02.222
he'd be dead by now.

16:04.137 --> 16:05.529
Huh.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.575
We never discussed Superman.
This was not the plan.

16:07.618 --> 16:10.360
This was always the plan.
I just didn't
apprise you of it.

16:10.404 --> 16:13.102
How could you not apprise me?
I'm your partner.

16:13.146 --> 16:14.538
Not partner, Miss Tessmacher.

16:14.582 --> 16:18.064
Protegee, factotum, flunky.

16:18.107 --> 16:19.456
I am the decider.
Is that clear?

16:19.500 --> 16:22.111
Our plan was to have
a lifetime supply of energy.

16:22.155 --> 16:23.939
You'll waste half of that
attacking Argo.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.029
Don't throw everything away
over this obsession
with Superman--

16:27.073 --> 16:30.990
Superman
will be destroyed by my hand.

16:32.513 --> 16:34.471
He will burn.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.908
Come on, honey.
You're gonna love it.

16:38.998 --> 16:42.001
Our victory deserves fireworks.

16:47.615 --> 16:50.052
Can't work in here, man.

16:50.096 --> 16:51.445
Hey, man, watch where
you're going, brother.

16:51.488 --> 16:52.968
-No, no, you shoved me.
-You bumped into me, man.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.839
-Who you talking to?
-Back off, man!

16:57.494 --> 16:58.539
Hey!

16:58.582 --> 17:00.497
Stop it, or you're going
to the pods.

17:00.541 --> 17:01.237
All right, man.

17:28.221 --> 17:29.309
There's
the pylon control.

17:36.185 --> 17:37.491
My powers are coming back.

17:37.534 --> 17:39.232
Astral project
to Brainy and the others.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.328
Well, how was my article?

17:48.371 --> 17:50.330
This is historic.

17:50.373 --> 17:52.332
Okay, people are gonna be
talking about this article

17:52.375 --> 17:54.290
like they did with
Woodward and Bernstein.

17:54.334 --> 17:57.685
I don't care if they're
talking about it, as long as
they listen to it.

17:57.728 --> 18:00.079
Task executed.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.733
Lillian Luthor's
extraction device
is now mobilized.

18:02.777 --> 18:05.519
We can use it to extract
the Harun-El from
Ben Lockwood's system

18:05.562 --> 18:07.521
whenever and wherever
we encounter him.

18:07.564 --> 18:09.740
Well, then we can use it
to extract from James.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.046
But first...

18:11.090 --> 18:14.397
The time is exactly... now.

18:16.530 --> 18:20.360
Guys, Lex's
alien power facility
is at Shelley Island.

18:20.403 --> 18:23.058
What do you mean,
"The time is now"?

18:23.102 --> 18:25.234
-Guys...
-If my calculations
are correct,

18:25.278 --> 18:28.237
Dreamer has just
astral projected
into this office.

18:28.281 --> 18:30.196
You anticipated me being here?

18:30.239 --> 18:32.589
She is here.
She is wondering
in this exact moment

18:32.633 --> 18:34.504
how she can contact us.

18:34.548 --> 18:36.550
Because an astral projectee
can place themselves
in any environment,

18:36.593 --> 18:38.900
but they cannot interact
with that environment.

18:38.943 --> 18:40.728
So how is this
a good plan?

18:40.771 --> 18:42.164
Thank you.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.297
Dreamer's astral projection
is pure dream energy,

18:44.340 --> 18:47.343
and as such, while she cannot
interact with us,

18:47.387 --> 18:50.216
she can interact and ionize
other energy.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.043
Electrons to be exact.

18:55.482 --> 18:58.746
Dreamer, concentrate
your energy on the molecules
in this water vapor,

18:58.789 --> 19:00.182
and ionize it.

19:00.226 --> 19:02.402
I think he means
to write on it.

19:11.106 --> 19:13.891
Shelley Island.
Of course.

19:13.935 --> 19:15.632
They're in trouble.

19:15.676 --> 19:17.112
I'll go get James.

19:18.679 --> 19:19.680
I really missed that.

19:21.725 --> 19:24.815
And now, a toast...

19:24.859 --> 19:27.601
To incinerating
the Man of Steel.

19:32.301 --> 19:35.174
I promise, there's
no Polonium-210 in it,

19:35.217 --> 19:37.306
like you put in my tea.

19:37.350 --> 19:40.614
Killing your own son
with ionizing radiation,

19:41.092 --> 19:43.269
now that is on brand.

19:44.879 --> 19:49.536
Cancer may have aged you
prematurely, but you're still
as sharp as ever.

19:49.579 --> 19:51.146
So,

19:51.190 --> 19:53.104
what's stopping you
from shooting
me and your sister?

19:53.148 --> 19:57.108
Call me crazy,
but I'm partial
to my relatives.

19:57.152 --> 19:59.285
I just can't bear
killing you guys.

19:59.328 --> 20:02.679
If you do this, it's genocide.

20:02.723 --> 20:04.855
The public will
find out the truth,
and when they do--

20:04.899 --> 20:07.467
The truth is meaningless.

20:07.510 --> 20:10.296
The people of Earth
believe I am their savior.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.994
They needed a human hero,
and I fulfill that need.

20:13.037 --> 20:17.303
-Nothing will ever
change their minds.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.436
Facts are irrelevant.

20:21.742 --> 20:22.873
All that matters is spin.

20:24.571 --> 20:26.790
People are so stupid,
they don't even read.

20:26.834 --> 20:30.577
-And even when they do,
they certainly don't think.

20:30.620 --> 20:33.797
I am the leader
of this nation now,

20:35.016 --> 20:37.192
and nothing can stop me.

20:44.591 --> 20:46.680
The pylons are off.

20:50.118 --> 20:51.293
Where are J'onn and Dreamer?

20:51.337 --> 20:53.077
It appears they're
in the middle of a riot.

20:53.121 --> 20:57.647
What's worse, the alien power
being collected
in this factory,

20:57.691 --> 21:00.998
Lex has it set up to be
discharged into
a Claymore satellite.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.740
Claymore?
I... I destroyed that.

21:03.784 --> 21:07.744
This appears to be a newer,
bigger, better Claymore.

21:07.788 --> 21:09.050
Can you tell where
it's targeting?

21:09.093 --> 21:12.358
The target is in deep space.
Argo City.

21:12.401 --> 21:13.837
He's going to
wipe out my family.

21:13.881 --> 21:16.579
I may be able to hack into
the power core to stop it.

21:16.623 --> 21:20.366
Good, do that.
We'll help J'onn
and Dreamer.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.890
Supergirl!

21:22.933 --> 21:27.547
Me and my supercharged friends
came here to deal with Luthor

21:27.590 --> 21:31.594
and the dangerous aliens
that he brought here.

21:31.638 --> 21:34.293
But I'm so glad

21:36.251 --> 21:38.862
you came here too.

22:11.504 --> 22:12.983
This must be the core.

22:16.465 --> 22:19.860
J'onn, Dreamer. My plan worked.

22:21.383 --> 22:23.080
That was for abandoning us.

22:24.560 --> 22:26.214
Now let's help these people.

22:26.867 --> 22:27.955
I will.

22:27.998 --> 22:30.000
First, there are
more pressing matters.

22:30.044 --> 22:34.091
Argo is being targeted by Lex
imminently, and it is
up to me to stop it.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.920
The system is
denying me access.

22:36.964 --> 22:39.706
There must be something
we can do to stop the launch.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.883
No. There is
nothing we can do.

22:42.926 --> 22:45.407
The power core has reached
its peak capacity.

22:45.451 --> 22:47.714
The Claymore will fire on Argo
in less than two minutes.

22:47.757 --> 22:49.585
You said the core was peaking.

22:49.629 --> 22:51.326
That means it can be
overloaded, right?

22:51.370 --> 22:53.633
You would need a power supply
of at least 20 pods

22:53.676 --> 22:56.766
to overload the core
in the time we have left.

22:56.810 --> 23:00.074
You're going to try to use
your psychic powers
to overload the core.

23:00.117 --> 23:01.728
I told you there was a way.

23:01.771 --> 23:05.732
There is only an 18% chance
that this attempt will succeed,

23:05.775 --> 23:09.605
yet a 98% chance
that the effort will kill you.

23:09.649 --> 23:11.651
During the battle
for my own home planet,

23:13.087 --> 23:16.046
I ran, millions died.

23:16.090 --> 23:19.136
I will not make
that same mistake again!

23:22.444 --> 23:25.099
-Now, on with the show.
Shall we?

23:28.450 --> 23:30.234
Miss Tessmacher!

23:32.019 --> 23:33.716
Why is the satellite
not firing?

23:33.760 --> 23:35.370
There's an issue
at Shelley Island.

23:36.327 --> 23:37.764
No one leaves!

23:46.250 --> 23:47.861
Don't get any ideas.

23:47.904 --> 23:49.689
You wretched little traitor.

23:55.521 --> 23:57.392
-Mom!
-That's my girl.

24:12.189 --> 24:13.626
You're bleeding.

24:13.669 --> 24:14.844
I'm okay.

24:25.072 --> 24:27.378
We need to get the Harun-El
out of Ben now!

24:40.087 --> 24:41.131
Lex.

24:43.264 --> 24:44.874
Go. We got this.

25:01.978 --> 25:03.589
How are you alive?

25:04.372 --> 25:05.678
How did you do it?

25:05.721 --> 25:07.462
How do you think I did it?

25:08.507 --> 25:09.986
I'm Supergirl.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.727
Just like your cousin.

25:11.771 --> 25:14.295
No matter how many times
I stamp you out,

25:14.338 --> 25:17.037
you miraculously resurface

25:17.080 --> 25:19.953
with your glossy cape
and your perfect hair.

25:19.996 --> 25:22.651
Let me let you in
on a little secret, Lex.

25:22.695 --> 25:24.958
Truth and justice
always prevail.

25:27.438 --> 25:29.963
You and your cousin
are such saps.

25:30.703 --> 25:32.966
Luckily, I came prepared.

25:38.232 --> 25:39.625
So did I.

25:47.502 --> 25:49.548
You can thank
your sister for this.

25:54.030 --> 25:56.119
See? I told you.

25:56.163 --> 25:57.686
He can't put out
enough energy.

25:58.252 --> 25:59.993
He can, if I help him.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.916
Little boxes,

26:11.178 --> 26:12.005
little boxes,

26:13.310 --> 26:15.835
boxes and boxes,

26:15.878 --> 26:19.926
and subroutines and Socrates
and Aristotle

26:19.969 --> 26:25.105
and Avatarand matrices
and Memento

26:25.148 --> 26:28.108
and Monty Python and...

26:29.022 --> 26:29.979
Dreamer!

26:32.895 --> 26:33.853
Stop...

26:35.158 --> 26:36.812
Stop what you're doing!

26:36.856 --> 26:39.162
What you're doing
doesn't make any sense!

26:50.434 --> 26:52.175
No.

26:52.219 --> 26:53.786
Listen to me, Nia.
I don't know if you can
hear me, but I'm back.

26:53.829 --> 26:57.224
I'm realigned, and...

26:57.267 --> 27:01.010
And I realize now that
everything, everything
I said before was wrong.

27:01.054 --> 27:02.533
You can do this.

27:06.407 --> 27:08.148
You're doing it!

27:08.191 --> 27:09.584
Yes, you did.

27:09.628 --> 27:12.195
-You're doing this! You see?

27:12.239 --> 27:15.068
You're doing it!
You're amazing!

27:15.111 --> 27:16.504
You're astounding!

27:16.547 --> 27:20.029
-You're astazing Nia Nal!

27:21.204 --> 27:22.684
And I love you.

28:40.153 --> 28:41.981
We got him.

28:42.024 --> 28:43.373
All right,
let's get out of here!
Let's go, let's go!

28:43.417 --> 28:46.159
Get out of here! Let's go!

28:47.813 --> 28:50.163
Let's get these aliens
somewhere safe.

29:03.306 --> 29:05.613
That's better.

29:05.656 --> 29:09.312
Now smile, and take this
like a Kryptonian.

29:25.415 --> 29:26.242
Oh, no.

29:26.286 --> 29:27.809
No.

29:29.245 --> 29:30.159
You were right.

29:33.859 --> 29:38.733
My Alex was nothing
like your Alex.

29:38.777 --> 29:43.129
Protect your people
as I protected mine.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.412
Oh.

30:05.455 --> 30:06.761
How about that.

30:07.762 --> 30:11.418
Two birds,
one alien hand-cannon.

30:31.742 --> 30:33.266
This is for Red Daughter.

30:53.808 --> 30:55.375
It's over!

30:55.810 --> 30:57.246
Let me save you.

30:58.465 --> 30:59.422
Saved?

31:00.293 --> 31:01.990
By a Kryptonian?

31:03.513 --> 31:05.080
I'd rather die.

31:35.371 --> 31:37.460
No more
superpowers for you.

31:39.201 --> 31:40.550
Lena.

31:40.594 --> 31:41.987
What a surprise.

31:42.030 --> 31:43.379
What can I say, Lex?

31:44.032 --> 31:45.512
You've become predictable.

31:47.166 --> 31:49.559
I left the journal for you,

31:49.603 --> 31:53.433
paired it with the mural,
hoping you would
remember this place

31:54.521 --> 31:57.263
and show up when I needed you.

31:57.306 --> 32:00.005
You know, it just
comes down to this, sis.

32:00.048 --> 32:03.095
You can only count on blood.

32:04.966 --> 32:06.446
Come on, give me a hand.

32:09.144 --> 32:14.280
Come on, Lena,
this is no time for theatrics.

32:14.323 --> 32:18.414
We both know
no matter how much
you despise me,

32:18.458 --> 32:20.329
you're not ruthless enough
to pull that trigger--

32:27.336 --> 32:30.949
The world will never be
a safe place with you in it.

32:31.471 --> 32:33.299
Oh, brava!

32:36.041 --> 32:38.130
You did it, Lena.

32:40.959 --> 32:42.482
You killed me.

32:43.483 --> 32:45.311
You finally proved

32:45.354 --> 32:48.009
that I've been
underestimating you
all this time.

32:52.492 --> 32:54.146
But, when I'm gone,

32:55.060 --> 32:57.540
who will be left
to be proud of you?

32:58.933 --> 33:00.891
What, your friends?

33:00.935 --> 33:06.332
The joke's on you.
It's always been on you.

33:12.294 --> 33:17.647
Your friends have been
lying to you from the start.

33:18.692 --> 33:22.130
Your boyfriend Jimmy,

33:22.174 --> 33:27.614
Alex, J'onn, that
little alien runt Brainy.

33:28.093 --> 33:30.443
Even your own mother.

33:30.486 --> 33:34.534
They've mocked you,
humiliated you,

33:35.491 --> 33:36.492
betrayed you.

33:37.493 --> 33:41.019
Every last one.

33:42.150 --> 33:44.631
Denial's a very
powerful thing, isn't it?

33:44.674 --> 33:48.156
It's been standing
right in front of you
all this time.

33:48.200 --> 33:52.291
And you chose not to see it.

33:54.728 --> 33:59.515
Kara Danvers is Supergirl.

34:01.082 --> 34:03.476
I'm about to die,

34:03.519 --> 34:08.307
but at least I lived
without ever being a fool.

34:08.350 --> 34:12.615
You're left with no one
and nothing.

34:34.028 --> 34:36.422
Following
the revelations of CatCo reporter Kara Danvers' expose,

34:36.465 --> 34:40.687
the Cabinet invoked
the 25th Amendment
to remove Baker from office.

34:40.730 --> 34:42.906
Talk about power of the press.

34:42.950 --> 34:44.821
Says my injured friend.

34:44.865 --> 34:46.823
I still can't believe
what happened to your eye.

34:47.302 --> 34:49.130
Me either.

34:49.174 --> 34:51.350
I'm sorry Brainy
couldn't design
the Harun-El extractor

34:51.393 --> 34:55.441
without kickback,
but I think we're
all just happy you're okay.

34:55.484 --> 34:57.747
Well, I'm just happy
justice prevailed

34:57.791 --> 34:59.836
and Lockwood and his cohorts
got locked up.

34:59.880 --> 35:02.926
And the injury reminds me
that I'm human, which
I started to miss.

35:02.970 --> 35:05.799
Well, I'm just happy
people are talking again,

35:05.842 --> 35:08.280
and, you know,
listening to facts.

35:08.323 --> 35:11.631
Yeah. These have been
some dark days.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.589
And I'll admit, there were
some times where I thought

35:13.633 --> 35:14.982
we would never get out of it,

35:15.025 --> 35:17.941
but we didn't give up,
and we kept chipping away,

35:17.985 --> 35:19.769
until we brought
the truth to light.

35:20.857 --> 35:25.253
Can you believe
the Fourth Estate
saved the day?

35:25.297 --> 35:28.517
Vice President Plastino
has lifted martial law

35:28.561 --> 35:30.476
and reinstated
the Alien Amnesty Act

35:30.519 --> 35:33.870
until such time
as a full vote
can be held in Congress.

35:33.914 --> 35:35.524
On another note,

35:35.568 --> 35:38.179
I want to send
a message to Supergirl,

35:38.223 --> 35:40.138
wherever she may be.

35:40.181 --> 35:43.141
For a moment,
this country doubted you.

35:44.054 --> 35:45.752
But we won't
make that mistake again.

35:45.795 --> 35:49.277
A grateful nation
thanks you for your service.

35:52.846 --> 35:55.936
City's a lot nicer
without the tanks
and the soldiers, huh?

35:55.979 --> 35:59.896
If I don't see another
tactical vest all year,
it'll be too soon.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.638
We've been through
a lot of intense stuff together

36:02.682 --> 36:04.205
in a short amount of time,
haven't we?

36:04.249 --> 36:06.773
That would be
the understatement
of the century. Yeah.

36:08.731 --> 36:11.865
So, here's the strange part.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.738
I don't want it to end.

36:16.522 --> 36:18.176
The closeness with you,

36:18.219 --> 36:23.137
it has felt like both
the most natural thing
in the world

36:23.703 --> 36:26.314
and like a revelation.

36:26.358 --> 36:29.099
And I hope to God that
I haven't made this
awkward between us.

36:29.143 --> 36:30.666
I just...

36:32.015 --> 36:35.715
I haven't felt like this
in a long time,

36:35.758 --> 36:37.630
and I just felt like I had to--

36:42.156 --> 36:43.679
Ditto.

36:45.507 --> 36:48.206
Fear not.
We see nothing.

36:58.433 --> 36:59.260
Attack card.

37:02.481 --> 37:04.091
I don't understand.

37:04.700 --> 37:05.962
Sorry.

37:06.006 --> 37:08.356
How did you get
so good at this so quickly?

37:08.400 --> 37:09.705
After last we played,

37:09.749 --> 37:13.927
I went home and ran
67 billion simulations.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.842
Tried to game out
the most desirable outcome.

37:15.885 --> 37:18.105
-So you're counting cards?
-Yes.

37:18.148 --> 37:19.193
She gets it.

37:20.150 --> 37:21.891
Don't tell people that.

37:24.024 --> 37:25.199
-Hey!
-Yay!

37:25.243 --> 37:27.027
There she is!

37:27.070 --> 37:28.158
James will be here soon,
and then the whole family
will be together.

37:28.202 --> 37:30.204
- Huzzah!
-Where've you been?

37:33.120 --> 37:35.731
I didn't know what to bring,
so I bought
red and white.

37:35.775 --> 37:37.559
-Yes!
-Nice!

37:37.603 --> 37:40.083
Now that you're here,
we can divide up
and play Catch Phrase.

37:40.127 --> 37:44.044
Yeah, J'onn is
making us switch up
the usual teams.

37:44.087 --> 37:45.785
My house, my rules.

37:45.828 --> 37:48.353
But, uh, you're with me, right?

37:48.396 --> 37:49.397
Always.

37:49.441 --> 37:50.398
Good.

37:52.357 --> 37:54.010
I'm gonna get some more wine.

37:57.187 --> 37:58.798
Hey.

37:58.841 --> 38:00.974
You're not upset that Brainy's
just killing it over there

38:01.017 --> 38:03.281
with this game, right?
'Cause you know we're
gonna take him down.

38:03.324 --> 38:06.240
-Uh, we're gonna
cream him, but...
-Yeah.

38:07.197 --> 38:08.416
No, I'm, uh...

38:10.723 --> 38:12.290
I'm worried about Lena.

38:16.946 --> 38:18.818
I have to tell her the truth.

38:18.861 --> 38:21.734
I can't keep it
from her anymore.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.388
Lena's been through hell.

38:24.258 --> 38:25.694
We finally got to a place

38:25.738 --> 38:27.957
where it sort of feels
a little normal again,

38:28.001 --> 38:32.788
so, I don't know,
maybe you just
let her enjoy the evening

38:32.832 --> 38:34.050
before we take it away.

38:36.618 --> 38:37.880
You're right.

38:39.055 --> 38:40.318
Not tonight.

38:43.103 --> 38:46.019
Come on, come on, come on.
Okay, here we go.

38:46.062 --> 38:49.414
Turning against each other
has only led to more division,

38:49.457 --> 38:51.416
more hate and more violence.

38:51.459 --> 38:52.982
There must be a better way.

38:53.026 --> 38:54.767
Has your
perspective changed

38:54.810 --> 38:56.290
because of what happened
to your father?

38:56.334 --> 38:58.510
Yes.

38:58.553 --> 39:01.643
I've seen firsthand
how that kind of anger
can tear a family apart.

39:01.687 --> 39:04.037
I've lived that heartbreak.

39:04.080 --> 39:06.953
And I wanna make sure
nobody else has to.

39:06.996 --> 39:09.695
If humans and aliens
can just listen to each other,

39:09.738 --> 39:12.045
then we can stand up, united,

39:12.088 --> 39:14.177
against those
who seek to divide us.

39:24.100 --> 39:25.450
Vacation?

39:26.146 --> 39:27.539
Weekend trip.

39:29.018 --> 39:31.369
Looks like
you packed plenty.

39:33.022 --> 39:35.982
But we'll always find you, Eve.

39:36.025 --> 39:38.898
No matter how many wigs
you cycle through.

39:41.422 --> 39:42.728
Who are you?

39:42.771 --> 39:44.382
You already know that, dear.

39:46.079 --> 39:47.863
I did everything you asked.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.300
I worked for him.

39:50.344 --> 39:51.954
I hurt people for him.

39:51.998 --> 39:55.218
Lex was supposed to
move the needle.

39:55.262 --> 39:56.394
He failed.

39:57.612 --> 39:59.397
So let me go.

39:59.440 --> 40:01.355
Sorry, sweetie,

40:01.399 --> 40:03.313
that's not on the agenda.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.406
Leviathan is everywhere.

40:10.016 --> 40:12.148
Leviathan is everyone.

40:13.933 --> 40:16.109
And Leviathan is coming.

40:37.522 --> 40:40.002
Where am I?

40:40.568 --> 40:41.656
Earth.

40:42.614 --> 40:45.181
It can't be.

40:45.225 --> 40:47.314
You've been trapped
for too long.

40:48.402 --> 40:51.144
A phantom to your people.

40:53.886 --> 40:58.238
Now it is time
to avenge yourself against
the brother who wronged you.

40:59.108 --> 41:00.501
Will you help me?

41:01.197 --> 41:03.199
It was I that brought you here.

41:04.200 --> 41:06.246
You must walk
the path yourself.

41:08.204 --> 41:09.641
Besides,

41:10.598 --> 41:12.644
I have one more place to visit.
