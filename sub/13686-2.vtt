Previously on "Ex on the Beach,"

00:03.203 --> 00:05.238
{\an8}ten sexy singles arrived
in paradise

00:05.305 --> 00:07.140
{\an8}for the ultimate
singles getaway.

00:07.207 --> 00:10.076
And as sparks started to fly,

00:10.143 --> 00:12.812
three of their exes arrived
to crash the party.

00:12.879 --> 00:14.614
You should've (bleep)
had the balls

00:14.681 --> 00:16.483
{\an5}to call me and be like,
"You know what, Lexi,
I'm just not there."

00:16.549 --> 00:18.752
You lied to me about it since
the mother(bleep) beginning!

00:18.818 --> 00:19.953
You not with him.

00:20.019 --> 00:22.322
"Ex on the Beach"
is he's your ex.

00:22.389 --> 00:24.791
{\an5}(announcer)
And the Shack of Secrets
was unleashed

00:24.858 --> 00:26.459
on its first victims.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.799
{\an8}And tonight,
Angela finds out the truth...

00:32.866 --> 00:34.401
{\an7}"I seriously can't
sleep right now

00:34.467 --> 00:36.169
{\an7}because I'm thinking
about our sex."

00:36.236 --> 00:38.405
{\an5}(announcer)
...which wreaks havoc
on the villa.

00:38.471 --> 00:39.873
Oh!

00:39.939 --> 00:41.341
(announcer)
Two more exes arrive

00:41.408 --> 00:43.710
ready to destroy this perfect
singles getaway.

00:43.777 --> 00:44.878
A flirtation...

00:44.944 --> 00:46.246
You know, I like you, bro.

00:46.312 --> 00:48.281
I have Paulie here
and I have Chris here.

00:48.348 --> 00:49.816
(announcer)
... turns to betrayal.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.785
I was feeling her
and she's (bleep) trying

00:51.851 --> 00:53.052
to give me the runaround
for what?

00:53.119 --> 00:54.254
(Chris)
Y'all still together or what?

00:54.320 --> 00:55.588
(Lexi)
No, are you kidding me?

00:55.655 --> 00:57.424
(announcer)
And the singles cast their votes

00:57.490 --> 01:00.193
in our first elimination
to send one ex home.

01:00.260 --> 01:02.195
Find your piece,
you'll be going home.

Welcome back.

01:24.050 --> 01:25.151
{\an8}Here's where things stand.

01:25.218 --> 01:28.087
{\an8}Tor'i and Angela got hot
and heavy real fast.

01:28.154 --> 01:30.290
{\an8}But things got messy
when her ex Derrick

01:30.356 --> 01:31.891
{\an8}rolled up on the beach.

01:31.958 --> 01:34.327
{\an8}So now Tor'i waits
while Angela's trapped

01:34.394 --> 01:36.396
{\an8}in the Shack of Secrets
with Derrick

01:36.463 --> 01:38.298
{\an8}where the truth
will be unlocked.

01:38.364 --> 01:40.433
{\an8}She gets to go through
his phone.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.669
{\an8}Taylor's new bae Cory
waits nervously

01:42.735 --> 01:44.938
{\an8}to see if one of her old flames
is coming

01:45.004 --> 01:47.173
{\an8}to burn up her new relationship.

01:47.240 --> 01:51.211
{\an8}Victoria and Skyler are both
still chasing after Chase.

01:51.277 --> 01:54.080
{\an8}Paulie and Lexi are rekindling
their relationship,

01:54.147 --> 01:56.449
but are working
on their trust issues.

01:56.516 --> 01:58.518
And Faith, Chris, and Taylor
are at the beach,

01:58.585 --> 02:01.921
where they're about
to find out whose ex is next.

02:01.988 --> 02:04.324
And here's our host, Romeo.

02:04.390 --> 02:06.326
{\an8}Now y'all probably thought
y'all was here

02:06.392 --> 02:09.929
{\an8}for a little
no-strings-attached
tropical love fest

02:09.996 --> 02:11.531
{\an8}or something like that.

02:11.598 --> 02:15.401
{\an1}Well, listen, your exes
are descending on the island.

02:15.468 --> 02:17.170
Some of them want revenge.

02:17.237 --> 02:19.472
But some of them want
to rekindle

02:19.539 --> 02:23.042
what they once had.
The time has come

02:23.109 --> 02:27.480
to see which one of your exes
will be moving into the house.

02:27.547 --> 02:30.216
I'm nervous.
Stay back! Stay back!

02:33.453 --> 02:35.021
(Chris)
I've dated some trainwrecks

02:35.088 --> 02:38.725
and one of them,
she's psycho.

02:38.791 --> 02:41.127
Whenever we (bleep) talk,
we just want to kill each other.

02:41.194 --> 02:42.829
{\an8}It's gonna be pretty
(bleep) gnarly.

02:44.364 --> 02:47.500
{\an5}(Taylor)
I do not want my ex
coming here at all.

02:47.567 --> 02:50.303
{\an8}I'm feeling Cory,
and I just feel like

02:50.370 --> 02:53.606
{\an8}my ex showing up can just
blow that all up for me.

02:53.673 --> 02:54.941
This about to be crazy.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.244
(suspenseful music plays)

03:03.950 --> 03:05.852
{\an3}Ahh...

03:08.321 --> 03:11.024
{\an8}My name is Chelsko.
I'm from Malibu, California.

03:11.090 --> 03:12.525
I am Malibu princess

03:12.592 --> 03:15.428
because I can be
so diva bougie.

03:15.495 --> 03:17.897
Like could you get more bougie?
N-n-n-no-no.

03:17.964 --> 03:21.267
I 100% understand why people
don't like me at first.

03:21.334 --> 03:23.703
Hot girl walks in,
you're intimidated.

03:23.770 --> 03:26.606
She's from Malibu,
She has everything she wants.

03:26.673 --> 03:28.575
But just because I'm beautiful
does not mean

03:28.641 --> 03:30.376
I can't be the coolest person
you've ever met

03:30.443 --> 03:31.578
and super down-to-earth.

03:31.644 --> 03:32.445
(bleep) my life.

03:32.512 --> 03:33.746
Gucci gang,
Gucci gang.

03:33.813 --> 03:35.114
(Chelsko)
Chris is my ex.

03:35.181 --> 03:37.283
Besides the fact that
I take care of him,

03:37.350 --> 03:40.386
I loved him and I gave him
everything that I could.

03:40.453 --> 03:42.522
I found out
that he had cheated on me,

03:42.589 --> 03:44.123
and that's the last
I've seen him.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.526
So I'm coming here for closure

03:46.593 --> 03:50.296
because I am a princess
and I deserve to be happy.

03:55.034 --> 03:56.569
Come on, "Baywatch."

03:56.636 --> 03:58.871
{\an5}(Chelsko)
It's really weird
coming up to Chris

03:58.938 --> 04:02.308
{\an8}and seeing him
because that was my whole world.

04:02.375 --> 04:03.710
{\an8}That was my best friend.

04:03.776 --> 04:06.179
{\an8}That was all I was worried about
all the time.

04:06.245 --> 04:08.581
(Romeo)
So why did y'all break up?

04:08.648 --> 04:10.917
{\an1}He cheated on me
on New Year's last year.

04:10.984 --> 04:13.786
{\an4}And then broke up with me
'cause he didn't have
the balls to tell me.

04:15.021 --> 04:17.423
Oh!
(chirps)

04:17.490 --> 04:18.992
Well, she hooked up
with my uncle.

04:19.058 --> 04:20.125
Game, game.

04:20.192 --> 04:22.795
Not your uncle!
(chirps)

04:24.430 --> 04:25.898
Chelsko and my uncle
had a thing,

04:25.965 --> 04:27.066
and I know they (bleep) did.

04:27.133 --> 04:29.268
{\an8}And she, till this day,
tells me,

04:29.335 --> 04:31.037
{\an8}when I cheated on her
on New Year's,

04:31.104 --> 04:33.439
she thinks that is not as bad
as hooking up with my uncle.

04:33.506 --> 04:34.807
She has done so much
(bleep) to me

04:34.874 --> 04:36.576
that's like
mentally (bleep) me over.

04:36.643 --> 04:39.579
Wait, hold on, hold on.
We got one more person.

04:39.646 --> 04:40.713
Don't do that.

04:42.148 --> 04:45.284
♪♪

04:45.351 --> 04:47.487
If my ex is walking onto
the beach right now,

04:47.553 --> 04:50.289
I don't want nobody
touching my ex,

04:50.356 --> 04:51.691
looking at my ex.

04:51.758 --> 04:54.594
{\an8}He ain't gotta be mine,
but he's not yours.

04:56.929 --> 05:00.033
(suspenseful music plays)

05:06.039 --> 05:07.040
{\an6}Ohh...

05:06.039 --> 05:07.040
Oh, who's this?

05:07.106 --> 05:08.474
{\an1}Taylor!

05:10.376 --> 05:12.445
{\an8}I'm Andre.
I'm from Burnsville, Minnesota.

05:12.512 --> 05:14.280
I'm 22 years old.

05:14.347 --> 05:15.782
And I'm a farm boy at heart,

05:15.848 --> 05:19.052
so I definitely know how
to handle a hoe, for sure.

05:21.187 --> 05:23.256
{\an8}Taylor and I met
on "Are You the One?"

05:23.322 --> 05:24.757
and dated for about a year.

05:24.824 --> 05:26.759
{\an1}You should fear
for your life right now.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.428
{\an5}(Andre)
With the relationship
with Taylor,

05:28.494 --> 05:29.829
there's like bad blood
on both sides.

05:29.896 --> 05:31.864
I never said sorry
for cheating on her,

05:31.931 --> 05:33.232
which I can own up to.

05:33.299 --> 05:35.568
But Taylor,
she ran to social media

05:35.635 --> 05:37.603
with all of her issues
and problems with me.

05:37.670 --> 05:39.605
I don't want that
to be a thing anymore.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.374
I want to close the door
on our relationship,

05:41.441 --> 05:43.910
and she can go that way
and I'll go that way.

05:43.976 --> 05:45.411
And that's the end of it.

05:45.478 --> 05:47.580
He better look the (bleep)
away from me.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.215
{\an1}You being extra
right now?

05:49.282 --> 05:51.317
{\an1}Bye.
Shut the (bleep) up.

05:51.384 --> 05:53.820
{\an8}Andre cheated on me
with multiple different girls.

05:53.886 --> 05:56.289
So I dragged him
all over social media,

05:56.355 --> 05:57.590
put him on blast.

05:57.657 --> 06:00.293
I was very heartbroken
for a long time.

06:00.359 --> 06:01.994
I'm gonna have to sit
next to you, Chris.

06:02.061 --> 06:03.262
{\an4}Uh-uh.

06:02.061 --> 06:03.262
How you doing?

06:03.329 --> 06:04.664
How are you?

06:04.731 --> 06:06.966
Well, Faith, you get
your ass up outta here.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.601
{\an5}Go back to the house.

06:07.033 --> 06:08.601
Oh, oh.

06:08.668 --> 06:11.471
We want to let them enjoy
some happy-couple time.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.906
We'll catch y'all later.

06:13.973 --> 06:15.208
Let's roll out,
Faith.

06:15.274 --> 06:17.009
(Chris)
Bye.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.512

06:21.881 --> 06:24.617

♪ If you want my lovin'

06:27.520 --> 06:29.322
So you down to be
peaceful?

06:29.388 --> 06:30.690
I would like an apology

06:30.757 --> 06:33.192
for how you treated me
and what you did.

06:33.259 --> 06:35.661
{\an1}My "G," like,
you've done so much (bleep).

06:35.728 --> 06:37.830
Dude, you hooked up
with my uncle, B.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.298
{\an5}No, I didn't.

06:37.897 --> 06:39.298
Like what the (bleep)
are you saying?

06:39.365 --> 06:40.399
{\an5}No, you didn't?

06:39.365 --> 06:40.399
No, I didn't.

06:40.466 --> 06:41.901
{\an3}Oh, my God.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.503
{\an8}This is why things didn't
really work out with us.

06:43.569 --> 06:45.037
{\an8}It's because we're poison.

06:45.104 --> 06:47.740
{\an8}And you're coming here
to start (bleep) with me,

06:47.807 --> 06:50.443
{\an8}or like fix what the (bleep)
we have going on?

06:50.510 --> 06:51.644
{\an8}And it honestly doesn't
look like

06:51.711 --> 06:53.279
{\an8}you're trying to fix anything.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.616
{\an8}So I'm down to fix it, I'm down
to be friends, but that's it.

06:56.682 --> 06:58.918
{\an5}How you treat women...

06:56.682 --> 06:58.918
{\an3}Ugh...

06:58.985 --> 07:00.453
{\an5}...it's not okay.

06:58.985 --> 07:00.453
And how you treat men

07:00.520 --> 07:02.155
is perfectly fine, right?

07:02.221 --> 07:03.790
{\an3}Good-bye.

07:05.024 --> 07:06.392
{\an5}(announcer)
Hopefully things
are going better

07:06.459 --> 07:08.294
for Taylor and Andre.

07:08.361 --> 07:10.229
{\an1}There's no reason
you should be here right now.

07:10.296 --> 07:11.397
{\an6}Yeah?

07:10.296 --> 07:11.397
But you know what?

07:11.464 --> 07:13.099
{\an1}You don't care about me,
so that's fine.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.534
I don't care about you?

07:14.600 --> 07:17.236
{\an1}That was very clear.
The cheating, the lying.

07:17.303 --> 07:18.971
That's what you're still
upset about?

07:19.038 --> 07:20.239
You're still mad
about that?

07:20.306 --> 07:21.974
{\an1}Are you kidding me
right now?

07:22.041 --> 07:23.276
A year, a year later?

07:23.342 --> 07:24.911
{\an1}I can't even (bleep)
look at you.

07:24.977 --> 07:26.312
No, you can't?

07:26.379 --> 07:28.681
(Taylor)
He cheated on me all the time,

07:28.748 --> 07:31.050
and he can't even give me
a simple "I'm sorry."

07:31.117 --> 07:33.085
Like that's no respect for me.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.187
{\an1}(sobbing)
I'm not doing this.

07:34.253 --> 07:36.022
Like seriously, I'm not.

07:36.088 --> 07:37.690
{\an3}I'm done.

07:37.757 --> 07:40.159
{\an5}(announcer)
Looks like these two
have some bad blood.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.961
And speaking of bad blood,

07:42.028 --> 07:44.096
let's hope none is spilled
in the Shack of Secrets

07:44.163 --> 07:47.066
where Angela's about to have
her worst fears confirmed.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.202
"On the table you will
find Derrick's phone.

07:49.268 --> 07:51.971
{\an1}You will have seven minutes
to find the answers you need."

07:52.038 --> 07:54.073
{\an8}Since I met Derrick,
I haven't been able

07:54.140 --> 07:56.409
{\an8}to trust the fact that he's been
talking to so many girls.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.177
So now I get
to find out the truth.

08:03.115 --> 08:06.052
{\an8}I never lied to her.
I never cheated on her.

08:06.118 --> 08:08.221
{\an8}You want to go through my phone,
Angela, go through it

08:08.287 --> 08:10.790
{\an8}because you're not gonna
find anything I did
when we were together.

08:10.857 --> 08:12.892
You, you talked to mad girls.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.694
{\an5}Angela, I've been single.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.694
You talked to mad girls.

08:14.760 --> 08:17.096
I've been single.
I'ma ask you one question.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.799
I don't want you to think.
I just want you to feel.

08:19.866 --> 08:21.567
{\an5}Okay, what's your question?

08:19.866 --> 08:21.567
For once, for once.

08:21.634 --> 08:22.835
{\an6}For once.

08:21.634 --> 08:22.835
I feel like... Okay.

08:22.902 --> 08:24.237
Do you still have
feelings for me?

08:24.303 --> 08:26.072
{\an4}No.

08:24.303 --> 08:26.072
You're lying.

08:26.138 --> 08:27.874
{\an1}I'm not lying.
You can't tell me how I feel.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.976
{\an4}You can tell me how you...
Do you still have
feelings for me?

08:30.042 --> 08:31.510
{\an3}Yeah.

08:31.577 --> 08:33.645
I don't want to close
that door all the way.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.847
{\an1}It's closed.
I'm (bleep) done with you.

08:35.914 --> 08:36.982
I'm done with you.

08:37.049 --> 08:38.583
{\an1}This just proves that you
talked to mad bitches.

08:38.650 --> 08:40.586
{\an1}"I seriously can't
sleep right now

08:40.653 --> 08:42.154
{\an1}"because I'm thinking
about our sex.

08:42.221 --> 08:43.823
{\an1}I love how freaky
you talk."

08:43.890 --> 08:46.826
{\an4}And that's the girl
that you were flirting
with in New York.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.129
{\an8}Since I met Derrick,
I haven't been able

08:50.196 --> 08:52.431
{\an8}to trust the fact that he's been
talking to so many girls

08:52.498 --> 08:54.367
{\an8}and all these "best friends"
that he's had.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.769
Hit the name that I see
that I recognize,

08:56.836 --> 09:00.373
and he's talking about, oh, we
had some great sex last night,

09:00.439 --> 09:01.874
blah, blah, blah.

09:01.941 --> 09:04.210
Mind you, this is a girl
he told me not to worry about.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.846
Ding!
Validation complete.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.581
{\an1}'Cause everything
that I've said to you

09:08.648 --> 09:11.250
{\an1}in the past has just been
validated by that.

09:12.485 --> 09:13.786
{\an1}And you can be miserable
now that I know...

09:13.853 --> 09:14.987
{\an1}(whiny voice)
you still have feelings for me.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.656
{\an5}I'm miserable, like...

09:15.054 --> 09:16.656
You will be.

09:16.722 --> 09:17.857
You're a smitten
human being.

09:17.924 --> 09:19.558
And when I told you
I was gonna (bleep)

09:19.625 --> 09:21.327
{\an1}one of your castmates,
the dream is coming true, baby!

09:21.394 --> 09:22.561
{\an5}The dream is coming true!

09:21.394 --> 09:22.561
{\an3}Your dream.

09:22.628 --> 09:26.899
(muffled arguing)

09:26.966 --> 09:28.367
...you still have
feelings for me.

09:28.434 --> 09:29.535
{\an5}No, I don't.

09:28.434 --> 09:29.535
But you wouldn't...

09:29.602 --> 09:30.803
{\an5}It doesn't matter.

09:29.602 --> 09:30.803
No, I don't.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.372
We can go to hell,
we can go to heaven.

09:33.439 --> 09:35.675
It doesn't matter
where we (bleep) go...

09:35.741 --> 09:37.276
(muffled arguing continues)

09:37.343 --> 09:39.578
Yo, what is going on?

09:39.645 --> 09:41.280
(Tor'i)
Derrick and Angela are arguing.

09:41.347 --> 09:43.182
{\an8}I'm tired of hearing
the same things

09:43.249 --> 09:44.684
{\an8}about the same situation.

09:44.750 --> 09:45.952
{\an8}Like cut it loose.

09:46.018 --> 09:48.020
I have somebody
better than you.

09:48.087 --> 09:48.955
Get over it!

09:49.021 --> 09:50.556
{\an1}Be miserable.
Wear your sunglasses

09:50.623 --> 09:51.958
{\an5}day in and day out...

09:50.623 --> 09:51.958
How am I not over it?

09:52.024 --> 09:53.993
{\an5}...to hide your emotions.

09:52.024 --> 09:53.993
How am I not over it?

09:54.060 --> 09:55.995
{\an4}Do it.

09:54.060 --> 09:55.995
{\an3}Oh, my...

09:57.129 --> 09:58.597
I 100% think Angela,

09:58.664 --> 09:59.765
she doesn't give
a flying (bleep)

09:59.832 --> 10:01.033
{\an5}about Derrick right now.

09:59.832 --> 10:01.033
{\an3}No.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.436
It is what it is.
I mean, we'll see.

10:03.502 --> 10:05.404
{\an1}Oh, my God,
scared the (bleep) out of me.

10:05.471 --> 10:07.573
(Lexi)
Somebody's coming back.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.108
Whoa! Yo.

10:11.410 --> 10:12.878
What's up, guys?

10:12.945 --> 10:14.580
{\an4}(Paulie)
Hey, Angela.

10:12.945 --> 10:14.580
{\an3}Hi.

10:14.647 --> 10:15.781
(Paulie laughing)
What's up?

10:15.848 --> 10:17.149
(Lexi)
What happened?

10:17.216 --> 10:19.485
That Shack of Secrets
is no (bleep) joke.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.854
{\an5}Holy (bleep).

10:19.552 --> 10:21.854
What happened?

10:21.921 --> 10:23.122
What is it?
Explain.

10:23.189 --> 10:24.390
I'm like shaking.

10:24.457 --> 10:25.658
{\an1}There's just a message
for me and Derrick

10:25.725 --> 10:28.327
{\an1}saying that our main issue
has been trust.

10:28.394 --> 10:32.698
{\an1}So I have seven minutes to go
through his unlocked phone.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.200
{\an1}So I was able to see
everything

10:34.266 --> 10:35.534
{\an1}that I've been
wanting to know.

10:35.601 --> 10:38.938
{\an5}Holy (bleep).

10:35.601 --> 10:38.938
Whoa-ho-ho. Whoa.

10:39.005 --> 10:40.172
{\an3}I'm single!

10:40.239 --> 10:42.742
For me to be single
and be going through this

10:42.808 --> 10:44.510
is (bleep) amazing.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.012
{\an3}I'm single.

10:46.078 --> 10:49.348
{\an1}How does a single man
has his phone gone through?

10:50.616 --> 10:51.717
{\an8}I know she's about
to go up there

10:51.784 --> 10:53.119
{\an8}and tell the whole house

10:53.185 --> 10:55.221
and make me seem like
a bad guy as always.

10:55.287 --> 10:57.189
And I'm like, the whole house
is gonna hate me.

10:57.256 --> 10:58.591
{\an1}And I told him,
I was like,

10:58.657 --> 11:01.293
{\an1}what I have upstairs
is so much better than you.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.595
And he's just upset
about it.

11:02.661 --> 11:04.330
(Tor'i)
Damn.

11:10.536 --> 11:12.038
{\an5}Yo, what up?

11:10.536 --> 11:12.038
{\an1}Buddy.

11:12.104 --> 11:13.706
{\an1}How was the Shack of Secrets
for you?

11:13.773 --> 11:16.275
Shack of Secrets
for real.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.576
She went through my phone

11:17.643 --> 11:19.111
and there's nothing
she can show

11:19.178 --> 11:21.747
that shows I did her wrong
when we were together.

11:21.814 --> 11:23.549
{\an1}You were like, "Do you still
have feelings for me?

11:23.616 --> 11:25.518
{\an1}Please tell me you
still have feelings for me."

11:25.584 --> 11:27.019
Y'all see it.

11:27.086 --> 11:28.754
I'm not gonna say anything
and respond to that.

11:28.821 --> 11:30.122
{\an1}(snaps fingers)
You're not getting a reaction.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.158
I'm like, this is about
to be more drama.

11:32.224 --> 11:34.794
'Cause I'm about
to lose my (bleep) mind.

11:37.063 --> 11:38.297
Oh!

11:38.364 --> 11:40.399
Derrick gotta be the bad guy
all the time, right?

11:40.466 --> 11:41.534
{\an1}(Victoria)
What the (bleep)?

11:41.600 --> 11:43.202
Put it down.
Chill, ay!

11:43.269 --> 11:44.570
{\an8}(announcer)
Coming up,

11:44.637 --> 11:46.505
{\an8}Chris finally gets the answers.

11:46.572 --> 11:48.808
{\an7}"Did you sleep
with Chris's uncle?"

11:48.874 --> 11:50.910
{\an8}(announcer)
Cory reveals a truth to Taylor.

11:52.912 --> 11:54.747
{\an8}And Romeo drops a bomb.

11:54.814 --> 11:56.515
Tonight's gonna
be elimination.

11:56.582 --> 11:58.317
(announcer)
Someone's going home.

11:58.384 --> 12:02.188
{\an5}(Angela)
Who do I want to go
out of the exes? Hmm.

12:02.254 --> 12:03.422
Oh, my God.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.798
{\an5}(Derrick)
Derrick gotta be the bad guy
all the time, right?

12:12.865 --> 12:15.201
{\an5}Bro, what happened?

12:12.865 --> 12:15.201
{\an1}(bleep).

12:15.267 --> 12:16.635
Put it down.
Chill, ay!

12:16.702 --> 12:19.305
Derrick, bro.
Chill!

12:19.371 --> 12:21.273
He needs to calm
the (bleep) down.

12:21.340 --> 12:22.575
(Chase)
But who cares?

12:22.641 --> 12:23.876
That's 'cause he's still
hung up on her.

12:23.943 --> 12:25.044
{\an3}(bleep).

12:25.111 --> 12:27.513
{\an8}Like the girl I'm trying
to build with and be with,

12:27.580 --> 12:30.716
ex is just gonna be around
the whole time.

12:30.783 --> 12:32.585
What? I don't have
to deal with this.

12:32.651 --> 12:34.320
I said, I said,
man, look,

12:34.386 --> 12:35.654
we both down here.

12:35.721 --> 12:36.789
{\an1}It's just us.
Be real.

12:36.856 --> 12:38.224
{\an1}Like you still have
feelings for me.

12:38.290 --> 12:39.558
"No, I don't.
No, I don't."

12:39.625 --> 12:40.826
Okay, Angela.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.395
{\an5}I'm just here for support.

12:40.893 --> 12:43.395
{\an1}(chuckles)

12:43.462 --> 12:44.630
That is all I can.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.132
I know you're going
through it.

12:46.198 --> 12:47.533
I'm chillin', so.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.768
(announcer)
Let's see just how chill Cory is

12:49.835 --> 12:51.871
when Taylor shows up
with her ex.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.139
(chanting)
And Faith is back.

12:53.205 --> 12:54.473
There is Faith.

12:54.540 --> 12:55.808
(cheering and applause)

12:55.875 --> 12:59.645
(whooping, cheering)

12:59.712 --> 13:02.448
So, pretty much,
we're on the beach.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.950
We're excited.
We're anticipating.

13:05.017 --> 13:09.088
The first person that comes out
is Chris's girlfriend.

13:09.155 --> 13:12.591
{\an5}She walked out
squinting her eyes.

13:09.155 --> 13:12.591
{\an3}Whoo!

13:12.658 --> 13:14.360
And she was trying
to give body

13:14.426 --> 13:16.195
and it was
working a little bit.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.597
But he was like,
you (bleep) my uncle!

13:18.664 --> 13:21.267
{\an5}And I'm like...

13:18.664 --> 13:21.267
{\an1}Ooh!

13:21.333 --> 13:22.434
(overlapping shouting, laughter)

13:22.501 --> 13:24.203
{\an1}"You (bleep)
my uncle, bitch."

13:24.270 --> 13:26.438
(laughter)

13:26.505 --> 13:30.142
{\an8}Chelsko (bleep) Chris's uncle?
What?

13:30.209 --> 13:31.377
{\an8}Appreciate you, Uncle.

13:31.443 --> 13:32.711
{\an8}Thank you for being there
for me.

13:32.778 --> 13:34.747
{\an8}Who (bleep) their ex's uncle?

13:34.813 --> 13:36.382
{\an8}But, on a serious note,

13:36.448 --> 13:40.386
if he's hot and he's got money,
give me his number.

13:40.452 --> 13:43.155
{\an4}(Faith)
Right after that,
we had no time to breath.

13:43.222 --> 13:48.060
Like some light-skinned
like Cory doppelganger come out.

13:48.127 --> 13:50.062
Taylor's like irritated
and he's irritated,

13:50.129 --> 13:51.764
and I'm just sitting there
like, goddamn!

13:56.101 --> 13:57.536
How was your day?

13:57.603 --> 13:59.205
Ugh, I mean,
it's better now.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.040
{\an5}Yeah, we're glad
to have you back.

13:59.271 --> 14:01.040
Mmm...

14:01.106 --> 14:02.374
I'm glad to be back
with you guys.

14:02.441 --> 14:03.676
Where's your ex?
Let me meet him.

14:03.742 --> 14:05.844
I wish he was here,
you guys.

14:05.911 --> 14:07.713
Did Taylor and Chris's
ex show up?

14:07.780 --> 14:09.014
Oh, my God, yes.

14:09.081 --> 14:11.750
{\an1}And she said
he looks like you!

14:11.817 --> 14:14.153
Andre is here.

14:14.220 --> 14:15.888
Cory, how you feeling about
Taylor coming in the house

14:15.955 --> 14:17.323
{\an1}with someone she's dated
in the past?

14:17.389 --> 14:18.824
How you feeling about that?

14:18.891 --> 14:20.359
{\an1}I feel like she still cares
about him a little bit.

14:20.426 --> 14:21.894
And I just want to make sure
that they have that closure

14:21.961 --> 14:24.363
{\an1}before I get involved with her
in that type of way.

14:24.430 --> 14:26.665
You can completely tell
there was unfinished business.

14:26.732 --> 14:28.367
They're probably still
on the beach.

14:28.434 --> 14:29.702
They're probably drowning
each other right now.

14:29.768 --> 14:30.736
In the ocean.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.238
{\an1}Are they all
coming back here?

14:32.304 --> 14:34.473
Girl, if they do,
you better call Donald Trump.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.276
{\an5}Build a damn wall.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.276
(laughter)

14:37.343 --> 14:39.311
♪ I love just going
through the motions... ♪

14:39.378 --> 14:41.547
(announcer)
While some are trying real hard

14:41.614 --> 14:43.048
to keep their walls up,

14:43.115 --> 14:45.251
it looks like the walls
are starting to come down

14:45.317 --> 14:46.552
for some couples.

14:46.619 --> 14:47.786
(kissing sounds)

14:47.853 --> 14:49.255
{\an5}I do what you did.

14:47.853 --> 14:49.255
{\an3}You did...

14:49.321 --> 14:51.924
{\an3}(laughing)

14:51.991 --> 14:53.726
Awkward.
I don't know, it seemed like

14:53.792 --> 14:57.396
{\an8}they picked up right where
they left off and...

14:57.463 --> 14:59.331
definitely a little salty.

15:02.635 --> 15:04.136
{\an1}I could align your hips
if you want.

15:04.203 --> 15:05.838
Well, how do you know
if they're not aligned?

15:05.904 --> 15:07.406
{\an5}Can you check?

15:05.904 --> 15:07.406
Can <i> I</i> check?

15:07.473 --> 15:08.641
{\an6}Yeah.

15:07.473 --> 15:08.641
{\an1}Yeah.

15:08.707 --> 15:09.942
{\an8}(Lexi)
I can't say that I do trust him.

15:10.009 --> 15:12.945
{\an8}But that comes from the past.

15:13.012 --> 15:15.080
And I'm trying to move forward.

15:15.147 --> 15:18.784
So I'm hopeful
that he can prove himself

15:18.851 --> 15:20.185
every single day moving forward

15:20.252 --> 15:21.987
and build that trust again
with me.

15:23.455 --> 15:25.090
What's up, boy?!

15:25.157 --> 15:26.125
{\an1}What up?

15:26.191 --> 15:27.660
Chris is back.

15:27.726 --> 15:31.463
(all cheering, shouting)

15:31.530 --> 15:32.798
What's up, boss?!

15:32.865 --> 15:35.167
(excited shouting continues)

15:35.234 --> 15:36.802
Hi.

15:36.869 --> 15:40.673
{\an1}So where's everybody from?
I need info on everyone.

15:40.739 --> 15:42.174
{\an6}Everyone?

15:40.739 --> 15:42.174
{\an1}Yeah.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.977
{\an8}Chelsko, I mean, this girl,
she walked in this house

15:45.044 --> 15:47.713
{\an8}with a cape on
like she owned the place.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.682
{\an8}Hi, guys.

15:49.748 --> 15:52.318
{\an8}I just get a vibe
she's gonna be trouble.

15:53.652 --> 15:55.020
So how was it?

15:55.087 --> 15:56.622
Honestly, I'm glad
it happened now.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.490
{\an1}What's it like
between you guys? Like...

15:58.557 --> 15:59.892
Nothing.
Oh, my God, nothing.

15:59.958 --> 16:01.593
{\an1}Like you guys aren't
even civil, huh?

16:01.660 --> 16:02.661
No, not at all.

16:02.728 --> 16:03.862
I don't want him here.

16:03.929 --> 16:05.931
{\an5}'Cause he did you wrong.

16:03.929 --> 16:05.931
Right, but...

16:05.998 --> 16:07.433
{\an1}I don't,
I don't want him here

16:07.499 --> 16:09.902
because I don't want him
(bleep) up things for me.

16:09.968 --> 16:12.738
{\an8}I don't trust him.
That's my girl's ex.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.139
{\an8}I don't want you around.

16:14.206 --> 16:16.008
{\an8}You used to be with her,
you gotta go.

16:16.075 --> 16:18.043
It's me and her time.
You gotta go.

16:18.110 --> 16:20.212
Well, I'm happy
to have you back.

16:20.279 --> 16:21.513
{\an4}Are you?

16:20.279 --> 16:21.513
{\an3}Yeah.

16:21.580 --> 16:22.614
{\an1}Good.

16:22.681 --> 16:24.116
{\an1}(Andre)
I can't stop shaking.

16:24.183 --> 16:25.517
{\an1}As soon as I walked in,
I was like,

16:25.584 --> 16:26.685
ooh, this is weird.

16:26.752 --> 16:27.920
{\an1}I was like, uh,
I look up

16:27.986 --> 16:29.488
{\an8}and Cory just went,
mmm...

16:29.555 --> 16:30.989
{\an8}I'm like, damn, (bleep).

16:29.555 --> 16:30.989
{\an7}Yeah.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.591
{\an7}You could at least,
you know, be a dude about it

16:32.658 --> 16:33.726
{\an8}and be like, what up?

16:33.792 --> 16:34.860
{\an8}(Andre)
She's with Cory.

16:34.927 --> 16:37.162
{\an8}You gotta be (bleep)
kidding me, right?

16:37.229 --> 16:39.031
No, she wanted
to be with you.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.033
{\an5}You cheated.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.033
She still does love me.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.035
{\an5}I know she does.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.035
I think there's still
feelings there, easy.

16:43.102 --> 16:45.971
{\an1}For her to be so mad still,
it's kinda like...

16:46.038 --> 16:47.306
{\an1}She definitely still
has feelings,

16:47.373 --> 16:48.841
{\an1}but I don't know
if she, I don't know

16:48.907 --> 16:50.442
{\an5}if she needs closure.

16:48.907 --> 16:50.442
That's what it is.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.877
{\an5}That's why I'm here, bro.

16:50.509 --> 16:51.877
I don't know...

16:51.944 --> 16:53.245
{\an5}I don't know what it is.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.245
To close it.

16:53.312 --> 16:54.413
{\an1}Yeah.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.248
(announcer)
Andre might be here for closure,

16:56.315 --> 16:59.151
but Chris and Chelsko
are opening an old wound.

16:59.218 --> 17:00.452
{\an1}I mean, I don't know
if Chris is lying or not,

17:00.519 --> 17:02.254
{\an1}but what's all this business
about his uncle?

17:02.321 --> 17:03.722
He say you
slept with his uncle?

17:03.789 --> 17:04.923
{\an1}Oh, yeah, no,
that's not true.

17:04.990 --> 17:05.991
Wait, you (bleep)
his uncle?

17:06.058 --> 17:07.992
{\an4}No.

17:06.058 --> 17:07.992
(Chris laughs)

17:08.060 --> 17:09.528
{\an1}That's what
he tells everyone,

17:09.595 --> 17:10.561
but he has nothing on me.

17:10.628 --> 17:12.097
{\an1}But that's all
I'm saying.

17:12.164 --> 17:13.665
{\an1}That's why I don't
want to talk to him.

17:13.732 --> 17:15.000
Are you done, bro?
Like can you quit?

17:15.067 --> 17:16.367
Like for real.

17:16.435 --> 17:18.470
{\an8}Bro, like come on.
You need to stop lying.

17:18.537 --> 17:20.472
Even if you (bleep) my uncle,
just tell me.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.973
Be honest with me, you know?

17:22.040 --> 17:23.976
If I (bleep) your aunt,
I'd be like, hey, Chelsea,

17:24.041 --> 17:25.077
I (bleep) your aunt.

17:25.144 --> 17:26.512
{\an1}(Victoria)
What's the situation?

17:26.578 --> 17:27.913
'Cause I was in the shower.

17:27.980 --> 17:29.148
I'm trying to like
respect him

17:29.214 --> 17:30.682
and like already
he told people

17:30.749 --> 17:32.918
I (bleep) his uncle.
Like, no, I didn't.

17:32.985 --> 17:35.621
So I'm not gonna come here
and not defend myself.

17:35.687 --> 17:37.189
Like his Mustang, mine.

17:37.256 --> 17:39.024
His Mercedes that
he crashed, mine.

17:39.091 --> 17:40.793
That Audi he crashed,
my mom's.

17:40.859 --> 17:43.228
{\an3}(gasping)

17:43.295 --> 17:44.930
Like I get it,
you guys are exes,

17:44.997 --> 17:48.033
{\an8}but Chelsko keeps running
her mouth about Chris

17:48.100 --> 17:50.402
on a level that
I'm just not okay with.

17:50.469 --> 17:52.571
Do not throw dirt
on my boy's name.

17:52.638 --> 17:55.073
Chris's girl is out there
throwing dirt on his name,

17:55.140 --> 17:56.375
{\an1}saying he don't
have no car,

17:56.442 --> 17:58.076
he don't have a house,
he don't have (bleep).

17:58.143 --> 18:00.646
{\an5}Whoo...

17:58.143 --> 18:00.646
{\an1}I'm done.

18:00.712 --> 18:04.149
{\an1}I'm about to tell him.
I'm about to start (bleeps).

18:04.216 --> 18:05.651
{\an1}Yo, your girl
out there (bleep)

18:05.717 --> 18:07.419
you ain't got no car,
you ain't got no house.

18:07.486 --> 18:09.188
{\an1}She's saying
you don't have anything.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.923
Go up there and check her.
Go up there and check her.

18:10.989 --> 18:12.057
{\an5}Ooh, no, no, no...

18:10.989 --> 18:12.057
Don't let her hear.

18:12.124 --> 18:14.593
{\an5}Come talk to me.

18:12.124 --> 18:14.593
Wait a second.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.028
No, let's, let's talk.

18:16.094 --> 18:17.396
'Cause you got a lot
of (bleep) to say,

18:17.463 --> 18:18.764
{\an5}say it to my face.

18:17.463 --> 18:18.764
Can you ask nicely?

18:18.831 --> 18:19.932
Uh-oh.

18:19.998 --> 18:23.035
{\an1}They about to go
in... (bleep).

18:23.101 --> 18:24.436
You upstairs talking (bleep)?

18:24.503 --> 18:26.772
People come downstairs
and tell me,

18:26.839 --> 18:28.273
she's talking
mad (bleep), bro.

18:28.340 --> 18:29.908
I was just defending myself
because you told everyone...

18:29.975 --> 18:32.144
{\an5}Against what, bro?!

18:29.975 --> 18:32.144
{\an1}You.

18:32.211 --> 18:34.146
Because you told everyone
I slept with your uncle.

18:34.213 --> 18:35.547
Dude, what don't you get?

18:35.614 --> 18:37.182
"What don't you get?"
That's what you did.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.117
{\an5}Like, hello!

18:37.249 --> 18:39.117
Wait, you actually think that?

18:39.184 --> 18:40.652
Oh, my God, hello.
Listen, listen.

18:40.719 --> 18:43.689
{\an1}Chris, do you actually
think I slept with your uncle?

18:43.755 --> 18:45.557
{\an6}Oh, my...

18:43.755 --> 18:45.557
Are you kidding me?

18:45.624 --> 18:46.825
{\an3}I'm so...

18:46.892 --> 18:48.160
{\an1}Like the fact
that you can't admit

18:48.227 --> 18:49.294
{\an1}that you (bleep)
my uncle.

18:49.361 --> 18:51.697
Like you got me (bleep) up.

18:51.763 --> 18:52.965
{\an1}(Chelsko)
Oh, my God!

18:53.031 --> 18:53.999
{\an8}Now she took something
away from me

18:54.066 --> 18:55.334
{\an8}that's really,
really cherishable.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.668
The relationship I have
with my uncle

18:56.735 --> 18:58.003
is not there no more.

18:58.070 --> 18:59.538
If she doesn't try
to get "peace,"

18:59.605 --> 19:01.273
it's <i> finito.</i>

19:01.340 --> 19:02.674
{\an8}(announcer)
Coming up,

19:02.741 --> 19:05.511
{\an8}will Taylor ever forgive
Andre's cheating ways?

19:05.577 --> 19:07.613
{\an1}I just want a simple
"I'm sorry I (bleep) up."

19:07.679 --> 19:10.182
{\an5}(announcer)
And will things
with Paulie and Lexi end

19:10.249 --> 19:11.850
before they've even begun?

19:11.917 --> 19:13.652
{\an1}You trying to lead him on
like you got feelings for him.

19:13.719 --> 19:16.421
{\an5}I never said I was there.

19:13.719 --> 19:16.421
And now you trying
to act innocent.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.689
Don't play that.

19:17.756 --> 19:19.258
(Lexi)
We're exes for a reason.

19:22.961 --> 19:24.930
{\an5}Dude, she just like
cried about me thinking
she (bleep) my uncle.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.732
It's like, bro, like
what the (bleep)?

19:26.798 --> 19:28.300
If you did not (bleep) my uncle,
like be honest with me

19:28.367 --> 19:30.369
and be like, look, no matter
what the (bleep) you think,

19:30.435 --> 19:32.204
like I did not do it,
and I don't give a (bleep)

19:32.271 --> 19:33.939
{\an1}what you think because
that's what I'm going by

19:34.006 --> 19:35.307
{\an5}and that's what I'm real by.

19:34.006 --> 19:35.307
But you know what?
That's in the past.

19:35.374 --> 19:36.742
There's gotta be
a middle ground somewhere.

19:36.808 --> 19:38.076
Like eventually
he'll get over it.

19:38.143 --> 19:40.078
{\an4}No, no.

19:38.143 --> 19:40.078
(Chelsko)
Even though it hurts,

19:40.145 --> 19:41.413
I still have feelings for Chris.

19:41.480 --> 19:43.949
{\an8}And I do want some
sort of closure

19:44.016 --> 19:45.717
{\an8}for this chapter
of our relationship.

19:45.784 --> 19:47.619
{\an8}We've been through so much
together.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.923
And right now, this relationship
is just simply poisonous.

19:50.989 --> 19:53.892
I want us to figure out
how to fix that.

19:53.959 --> 19:55.294
(announcer)
Poor Chelsko.

19:55.360 --> 19:58.030
It's not easy being an ex
in the villa.

19:58.096 --> 20:01.033
It's also not easy
having an ex in the villa.

20:01.099 --> 20:04.236
{\an7}He was talking about
making kids with me earlier.

20:04.303 --> 20:06.204
Y'all were about to make kids
the first night.

20:06.271 --> 20:08.974
I want babies,
what can I say?

20:09.041 --> 20:11.276
Y'all so beautiful.
Y'all hate each other.

20:11.343 --> 20:13.512
{\an4}(laughing)

20:11.343 --> 20:13.512
Y'all hate each other.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.914
{\an8}I see Taylor and Cory
in this newfound relationship

20:15.981 --> 20:18.150
{\an8}that they have, and I just don't
see it lasting.

20:18.216 --> 20:20.986
But what do I know,
as her ex-boyfriend?

20:21.053 --> 20:22.387
Yeah, I know better
than what I did,

20:22.454 --> 20:24.256
but what I did was
clearly worth it.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.857
'Cause look at how
she acting right now.

20:25.924 --> 20:27.059
{\an1}(Chelsko)
What did you do to her?

20:27.125 --> 20:29.061
Cheated on her,
but it was like...

20:31.163 --> 20:32.864
{\an1}Yeah, yeah, you can call me
that if you want to.

20:32.931 --> 20:34.466
Things weren't really
working out,

20:34.533 --> 20:37.002
and I own up
to my (bleep), didn't I?

20:37.069 --> 20:39.204
{\an1}(Chase)
Ugh...

20:39.271 --> 20:42.007
{\an8}I hate your underwear.
(laughs)

20:42.074 --> 20:44.142
{\an1}You should give that dog
some lovin'.

20:44.209 --> 20:46.411
{\an5}He's just a pup.

20:44.209 --> 20:46.411
(laughs)

20:46.478 --> 20:49.247
(laughs)
He's just a puppy dog.

20:51.550 --> 20:53.552
(announcer)
Well, it looks like this dog

20:53.619 --> 20:54.920
isn't getting a bone.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.622
{\an1}So loud.
Can we go talk?

20:56.688 --> 20:58.624
{\an5}It's so loud.

20:56.688 --> 20:58.624
Sure.

20:58.690 --> 21:01.126
{\an5}(announcer)
Maybe Paulie will
have better luck.

21:03.729 --> 21:04.896
Hey, Gucci game.

21:04.963 --> 21:06.231
{\an5}Do you want to talk to me?

21:04.963 --> 21:06.231
Yes, please.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.467
{\an4}All right.

21:06.298 --> 21:08.467
Is that okay, Gucci?

21:08.533 --> 21:11.303
No, no, no, that's fine.
Go ahead.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.238
{\an8}I'm trying to work up
some magic with Lexi,

21:13.305 --> 21:16.675
{\an8}but Chris has been
throwing her vibes.

21:16.742 --> 21:19.111
{\an8}Do you play like games?
Do you play like Xbox

21:19.177 --> 21:21.813
{\an8}or some (bleep)?
Oh, (bleep).

21:19.177 --> 21:21.813
{\an5}(overlapping chatter)

21:21.880 --> 21:23.382
(Paulie)
It's like Pepé Le Pew.

21:23.448 --> 21:25.250
Like she has something
like floating off of her back,

21:25.317 --> 21:27.152
and he's just like... (blowing)
floating around like...

21:27.219 --> 21:29.488
(humming)
...like a little puppy dog.

21:29.554 --> 21:30.489
I like you, bro.

21:30.555 --> 21:33.058
{\an1}Like I have
a little-boy crush on you.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.893
{\an1}Being scared to hold
your hand type (bleep).

21:34.960 --> 21:36.395
{\an1}(chuckles)
I'm crushin'.

21:36.461 --> 21:39.731
{\an8}Chelsko, I'm already
onto some new girl, you know.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.433
Like what's her name?
(bleep).

21:41.500 --> 21:45.003
(bleep).
It's really simple.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.538
(laughs)

21:46.605 --> 21:48.540
But it's... chillin'.

21:48.607 --> 21:50.175
So it's Gucci.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.110
{\an8}But no, I like her.

21:52.177 --> 21:53.578
{\an8}Yes, Lexi.

21:53.645 --> 21:55.247
Bam!
(laughs)

21:55.313 --> 21:57.082
{\an1}I know you got a thing
with the homie.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.751
{\an5}That's obvious.

21:57.149 --> 21:59.751
{\an3}Yeah.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.720
I like you a lot
as a person.

22:01.787 --> 22:03.355
But, you know, like

22:03.422 --> 22:05.957
it's hard when he's trying
and like we're talking

22:06.024 --> 22:08.860
and like... cuddling.
Like it's hard.

22:08.927 --> 22:11.229
Like I'm in
a very hard situation.

22:11.296 --> 22:13.799
I am open to like
talking to other people

22:13.865 --> 22:16.368
{\an1}and seeing where things go,
like I'm open to that.

22:16.435 --> 22:18.937
So my girl Lexi showed up,
and we're on good terms.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.338
I mean, she came in

22:20.405 --> 22:22.140
and we kind of reconnected
right away.

22:22.207 --> 22:24.342
But the fact that
Lexi's (bleep) with Chris,

22:24.409 --> 22:25.877
I'm feeling a little hurt
by the whole thing

22:25.944 --> 22:29.581
because, for me, like
I remember being pushed away

22:29.648 --> 22:31.249
when we used to date.

22:31.316 --> 22:33.251
And for me, the fact that
you're not picking up

22:33.318 --> 22:36.254
what I'm putting down is
kinda making me feel like...

22:36.321 --> 22:38.523
I'm getting pushed away again.

22:39.558 --> 22:41.693
{\an1}I'm, I'm a really
persistent guy, bro.

22:41.760 --> 22:44.129
I have a feeling
that's the case, yeah.

22:44.196 --> 22:47.966
{\an8}I have Paulie here
and I have Chris here,

22:48.033 --> 22:50.202
{\an8}and I just...

22:50.268 --> 22:51.970
don't want to hurt
anyone's feelings.

22:52.037 --> 22:54.573
{\an1}You're goofy as (bleep)
and you play Xbox.

22:54.639 --> 22:56.575
{\an1}And I want to play
some games with you.

22:58.210 --> 22:59.544
I'm a hopeless romantic.

22:59.611 --> 23:01.847
{\an1}I promise you you're gonna
fall in love with me.

23:01.913 --> 23:03.215
{\an3}(chucking)

23:03.281 --> 23:05.450
(announcer)
Is Chris a hopeless romantic?

23:05.517 --> 23:07.586
Or romantically hopeless?

23:07.652 --> 23:09.721
Yeah, I thought I was going
to bed like 30 minutes ago.

23:09.788 --> 23:11.723
I'ma go to bed
elsewhere.

23:11.790 --> 23:12.791
{\an1}What do you mean,
elsewhere?

23:12.858 --> 23:13.925
Go to bed alone
tonight.

23:13.992 --> 23:15.327
You don't have me do
the runaround

23:15.393 --> 23:17.062
{\an5}for 30 minutes
to an hour.

23:15.393 --> 23:17.062
No, I just...

23:17.129 --> 23:19.030
{\an1}What were you talking about?
He asked me to talk.

23:19.097 --> 23:21.199
Be respectful.
Be respectful.

23:21.266 --> 23:22.701
{\an5}What do you mean?

23:21.266 --> 23:22.701
I don't give you
the runaround.

23:22.768 --> 23:24.503
{\an8}I'm doing my best right now
to show this girl

23:24.569 --> 23:26.505
{\an8}where I'm coming from,
and it feels like

23:26.571 --> 23:28.440
I'm getting two different
messages from her.

23:28.507 --> 23:30.142
I'm not one to kinda
let that linger.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.843
{\an1}I'm talking about
the fact that you said,

23:31.910 --> 23:33.345
{\an5}"Let's go to bed."

23:31.910 --> 23:33.345
{\an3}Okay.

23:33.411 --> 23:35.347
{\an1}And then I have to stay up
for two hours later?

23:35.413 --> 23:36.681
{\an5}Did I say you had to stay up?

23:35.413 --> 23:36.681
{\an1}For you?

23:36.748 --> 23:38.450
Nah, nah, nah, y'all...

23:38.517 --> 23:40.218
{\an1}Don't say "let's go to bed"
and then not go to bed.

23:40.285 --> 23:41.686
It's simple.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.355
It's that simple.

23:43.421 --> 23:46.324
{\an8}Supposedly, I had too long
of a conversation with Chris.

23:46.391 --> 23:48.260
But I want to be claimed.

23:48.326 --> 23:50.462
If I'm yours, I'm yours,
and I need to know it.

23:50.529 --> 23:52.631
That's kinda pathetic that
you're leading this man on

23:52.697 --> 23:54.199
{\an4}when you have
no feelings for him.

23:52.697 --> 23:54.199
You got somewhere else to go.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.201
{\an5}Kinda pathetic.
You're leading
the poor kid on

23:56.268 --> 23:57.369
when everybody's saying,
"Don't lead him on."

23:57.435 --> 23:58.837
{\an1}You're literally talking
to your (bleep) self.

23:58.904 --> 24:00.205
{\an1}Anyone got a mirror
so you can talk to yourself?

24:00.272 --> 24:01.606
You're playing
with the kid's heart.

24:01.673 --> 24:03.208
{\an1}You're trying to lead him on
like you got feelings for him.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.043
But you don't.
Don't play like you do.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.211
{\an1}(Andre)
Y'all still together or what?

24:06.278 --> 24:07.379
No, we're not (bleep)
together.

24:07.445 --> 24:09.014
Are you kidding me?

24:09.080 --> 24:10.348
We're exes
for a reason.

24:10.415 --> 24:12.083
I was feeling her,
and she (bleep) trying

24:12.150 --> 24:13.251
to give me the runaround
for what?

24:13.318 --> 24:14.920
Get the (bleep)
outta here.

24:20.659 --> 24:23.395
{\an1}You try to play it off
as if you and I

24:23.461 --> 24:25.897
{\an1}are not rekindling
our feelings for one another.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.399
{\an5}I'm not denying that.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.399
And it's cool.

24:27.465 --> 24:29.267
{\an1}'Cause multiple people ask you,
what's the situation?

24:29.334 --> 24:31.102
{\an1}People have asked you, too.
What have you said?

24:31.169 --> 24:33.071
{\an1}I am waiting to hear
what you think we are,

24:33.138 --> 24:34.339
{\an1}because at the end
of the day,

24:34.406 --> 24:35.807
{\an5}it is in your control...

24:34.406 --> 24:35.807
I mean, it is.

24:35.874 --> 24:37.309
...how fast you want us to go.

24:37.375 --> 24:41.146
{\an1}Because just we sleep together
at night, right?

24:41.213 --> 24:43.315
{\an5}Am I hiding the fact
that we cuddle?

24:41.213 --> 24:43.315
{\an1}We cuddle.

24:43.381 --> 24:44.516
{\an5}That's fine, that's fine.

24:43.381 --> 24:44.516
No, I didn't.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.051
I said the first
part of that.

24:46.117 --> 24:47.319
{\an5}That's fine.

24:46.117 --> 24:47.319
I don't want to (bleep) fight.

24:47.385 --> 24:48.787
This is a stupid
(bleep) fight.

24:48.854 --> 24:50.088
If you like me,
claim me.

24:50.155 --> 24:51.289
I'll claim you too,
but just let me (bleep)

24:51.356 --> 24:52.757
know where you stand.

24:52.824 --> 24:55.160
(announcer)
Sounds like Lexi wants Paulie

24:55.227 --> 24:56.795
to mark his territory.

24:56.862 --> 24:59.331
He could probably learn
a thing or two from Cory.

24:59.397 --> 25:01.032
{\an8}Be honest, though.

25:01.099 --> 25:02.834
{\an8}Like let me know
where I need to be.

25:02.901 --> 25:04.069
{\an8}Like...

25:02.901 --> 25:04.069
{\an9}With him?

25:04.135 --> 25:05.370
{\an8}I'm about to be looking dumb...

25:05.437 --> 25:07.672
{\an8}No, first of all,
he (bleep) me over.

25:07.739 --> 25:09.107
I broke up with him.

25:09.174 --> 25:10.809
So me and Alicia,
we ended things

25:10.876 --> 25:12.210
probably about two weeks ago.

25:12.277 --> 25:14.613
{\an5}(gasping, laughing)

25:12.277 --> 25:14.613
And we officially--

25:14.679 --> 25:15.847
Dead ass, though.

25:15.914 --> 25:19.317
{\an8}Alicia was with Andre
before I was with Andre,

25:19.384 --> 25:21.887
and we've never
liked each other.

25:21.953 --> 25:24.155
{\an5}(announcer)
You know what?
Hold that thought, Taylor.

25:24.222 --> 25:25.457
Here's what you need to know.

25:25.523 --> 25:27.726
{\an8}So, Cory dated Alicia
after Alicia dated Andre,

25:27.792 --> 25:30.395
{\an8}who also dated Taylor,
who's now dating Cory,

25:30.462 --> 25:32.831
{\an8}and that's why Taylor
and Alicia hate each other.

25:32.898 --> 25:36.902
{\an8}Yeah, it's confusing.
Okay, let's get back.

25:36.968 --> 25:38.803
{\an8}Okay, two weeks ago...

25:42.841 --> 25:45.644
{\an8}Okay, I didn't know that.
I wanna hear about that.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.245
{\an8}But, anyways...

25:51.316 --> 25:53.418
{\an8}Aww! That's cute.

25:53.485 --> 25:56.421
Yeah, I had a DNA test done.

25:56.488 --> 25:59.457
{\an5}Wait, so you just
found out?

25:56.488 --> 25:59.457
Just found out.

25:59.524 --> 26:00.792
{\an8}(Cory)
I'm a new dad.

26:00.859 --> 26:02.727
{\an8}And I'm definitely coming
into this situation

26:02.794 --> 26:04.863
{\an8}thinking a little differently,
you know?

26:04.930 --> 26:06.097
{\an8}We're a package deal.

26:06.164 --> 26:08.066
You're so cute.
You're all, like,

26:08.133 --> 26:09.601
giddy about it,
that's adorable.

26:09.668 --> 26:11.403
Hell yeah,
that's my daughter.

26:11.469 --> 26:13.705
{\an5}No, I know.
That's awesome.

26:11.469 --> 26:13.705
It is so weird.

26:13.772 --> 26:16.508
I would never tell somebody,
hey, you need to be a stepmom,

26:16.574 --> 26:19.210
anything like that,
but Taylor never blinked once

26:19.277 --> 26:20.245
when I told her
about my daughter.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.279
And that's attractive,
you know?

26:21.346 --> 26:22.814
My daughter's gonna come first,

26:22.881 --> 26:24.149
and she's gonna come second.

26:24.215 --> 26:25.350
That's just how it is.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.118
So are you ready
to be a stepmom?

26:27.185 --> 26:28.987
{\an5}No, but...

26:27.185 --> 26:28.987
{\an3}(laughing)

26:29.054 --> 26:31.389
(announcer)
Oh, stepmom? Hmm, well,

26:31.456 --> 26:33.425

It's a beautiful day, right?

Bro, you ain't gave us

{\an7}I just feel like this house
is getting crowded.

27:11.262 --> 27:14.032
{\an5}Uh-oh.

27:11.262 --> 27:14.032
So with that being said,

{\an5}tonight's gonna
be elimination.

27:14.099 --> 27:16.768

27:16.835 --> 27:18.336
{\an8}Things just got real,

27:29.347 --> 27:31.683
{\an1}I just feel like this house

{\an5}Uh-oh.

27:33.084 --> 27:35.553
So with that being said,

27:35.620 --> 27:38.757
tonight's gonna
be elimination.

27:38.823 --> 27:40.859
{\an8}One of y'all gonna be gone.

27:40.925 --> 27:42.093
This is not good.

27:42.160 --> 27:46.231
{\an1}The ten singles that
arrived here on day one,

27:46.297 --> 27:50.101
you get to vote
against an ex.

27:50.168 --> 27:53.972
{\an1}Whichever ex have
the most "cut" votes

27:54.039 --> 27:55.240
{\an1}gotta get the hell up
outta here.

27:55.306 --> 27:58.343
{\an5}Ooh!

27:55.306 --> 27:58.343
You gone.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.879
(Tor'i)
Ooh, I like that, okay.

28:02.113 --> 28:03.882
(Chelsko)
I'm scared to death.

28:03.948 --> 28:06.985
I'm like, everyone thinks
that I slept with his uncle.

28:07.052 --> 28:09.087
{\an8}I'm definitely on
the chopping block right now.

28:09.154 --> 28:10.255
(bleep).

28:10.321 --> 28:13.358
{\an1}Now, if you're crushing
or feeling somebody,

28:13.425 --> 28:15.827
{\an1}you vote "crush"
to keep them around.

28:15.894 --> 28:18.830
{\an1}A "crush" vote will
cancel out a "cut" vote.

28:18.897 --> 28:22.867
{\an1}If you're not feeling somebody
and you want them gone,

28:22.934 --> 28:26.704
{\an1}you vote "cut" and you put it
in this gold pineapple.

28:26.771 --> 28:28.506
It's that simple.

28:28.573 --> 28:33.745
{\an8}Let me think, who do I want
to go out of the exes? Hmm.

28:33.812 --> 28:35.346
Oh, (bleep).

28:36.948 --> 28:38.550
{\an8}When your destiny is controlled
by ten other people

28:38.616 --> 28:40.318
{\an8}in the house,
and one of those people

28:40.385 --> 28:41.653
happen to be your ex--

28:41.719 --> 28:44.122
and in my situation,
my ex hates me,

28:44.189 --> 28:45.457
not looking good for me.

{\an8}Ooh! I wonder
whose that was.

38:25.002 --> 38:27.772
Now, Derrick, Andre,

38:27.838 --> 38:30.608
let's see who's about
to get the ax.

38:30.675 --> 38:33.544
Derrick, please come
to your pineapple.

38:35.379 --> 38:37.882
{\an5}(Jasmine)
I do not want Derrick
to go home tonight.

38:37.948 --> 38:39.383
Maybe I'm not, like,
crazy into him,

38:39.450 --> 38:41.786
{\an8}but at least it's
an opportunity for a chance.

38:41.852 --> 38:44.021
{\an5}(Derrick)
If I do go home tonight,
I'ma be mad.

38:44.088 --> 38:46.123
I'm not a hateful person,
I'm not the type of person

38:46.190 --> 38:48.125
that like to have beef,
so it does suck

38:48.192 --> 38:49.427
knowing that I'll be leaving

38:49.493 --> 38:51.696
with nothing but hate
between my ex and I.

38:51.762 --> 38:54.298
{\an8}I'm just praying
that it's not me.

38:54.365 --> 38:57.268
{\an1}And you have to see
what's inside your pineapple.

38:57.334 --> 38:59.303
♪♪

39:08.112 --> 39:11.048
{\an1}And you have to see
what's inside your pineapple.

39:16.554 --> 39:18.422
You got two chips.

39:18.489 --> 39:21.325
The first one, "cut."

39:24.628 --> 39:27.465
{\an8}The second one, "cut."

39:28.833 --> 39:31.435
{\an8}That mean you definitely
at risk right now.

39:31.502 --> 39:33.070
{\an8}So take a seat.

39:33.137 --> 39:34.705
{\an5}(Derrick)
It's definitely gonna be
between Andre and I.

39:34.772 --> 39:35.940
Andre, you up next.

39:36.006 --> 39:37.274
(Derrick)
If Andre leaves,

39:37.341 --> 39:38.676
it sucks 'cause that's,
like, my guy.

39:38.743 --> 39:41.412
{\an8}So it's like...
Like, I'm screwed.

39:41.479 --> 39:44.281
There's a lot of uncounted
votes out there so far.

39:44.348 --> 39:45.850
Yeah.

39:50.454 --> 39:51.822
"Cut".

39:53.491 --> 39:54.859
"Cut".

39:56.660 --> 39:58.829
{\an8}Right now,
you're tied with Derrick.

39:58.896 --> 40:02.433
{\an8}Better hope for some "crushes".

39:58.896 --> 40:02.433
{\an8}Man.

40:02.500 --> 40:06.036
{\an8}But all of these are "cuts".

40:08.739 --> 40:11.475
Which means
you'll be going home.

40:11.542 --> 40:13.644
{\an1}Make sure you say
your goodbyes to everybody.

40:13.711 --> 40:15.412
Find your peace.

40:15.479 --> 40:18.783
{\an8}I know Tor'i is <i> pissed</i> that
Derrick isn't out.

40:18.849 --> 40:21.118
{\an8}But, bro, I need Andre
out of the house.

40:21.185 --> 40:22.920
{\an8}I need me and Taylor
to have our peace.

40:22.987 --> 40:24.955
Hopefully, you and Angela
can find it.

40:25.022 --> 40:27.858
{\an1}Enjoy the night,
and I'll see y'all next time.

40:27.925 --> 40:30.594
{\an8}I am really disappointed

40:30.661 --> 40:31.896
{\an8}that Derrick
is staying in the house.

40:31.962 --> 40:33.931
I definitely thought
that Derrick

40:33.998 --> 40:35.266
would be going home tonight.

40:35.332 --> 40:37.334
{\an8}But, boy, do not
get too comfortable.

40:37.401 --> 40:40.838
{\an8}♪♪

40:40.905 --> 40:44.375
{\an8}Here I am, the first one
to be eliminated

40:44.441 --> 40:46.277
{\an8}off of "Ex on the Beach."

40:46.343 --> 40:48.312
{\an8}But it's all right,
because I really came here

40:48.379 --> 40:50.281
{\an8}with one goal,
that was to have closure

40:50.347 --> 40:53.584
{\an8}with my ex-girlfriend Taylor,
which I got.

40:53.651 --> 40:56.153
{\an8}Andre gets eliminated,
he's done here.

40:56.220 --> 40:58.355
{\an8}I don't even
say goodbye to him.

40:58.422 --> 41:00.391
{\an8}Have a safe flight home.

41:00.457 --> 41:03.460
{\an8}(Andre)
With that being said,
I'm about to head out

41:03.527 --> 41:04.795
{\an8}the same way I came in.

41:04.862 --> 41:06.297
{\an8}Straight out there
under the ocean,

41:06.363 --> 41:08.299
{\an8}find my way back home
to the mainland.

41:08.365 --> 41:10.467
{\an8}I am no longer
an ex on the beach.

41:10.534 --> 41:12.503
{\an8}♪♪

41:18.075 --> 41:20.010
{\an8}(announcer)
Next time on
"Ex on the Beach"...

41:20.077 --> 41:23.080
will Cory's past
ruin his future?

41:23.147 --> 41:24.148
{\an1}What's up?

41:24.215 --> 41:25.916
(announcer)
Tor'i takes a shot on Faith...

41:25.983 --> 41:28.519
{\an5}Body shots.

41:25.983 --> 41:28.519
I swear! I swear!

41:28.586 --> 41:30.387
...that has explosive
consequences.

41:30.454 --> 41:31.956
Send me the (bleep) home!

41:32.022 --> 41:33.824
(announcer)
And whose ex is next?

41:33.891 --> 41:35.426
(Cory)
Oh, my God...
