11:46.505 --> 11:49.475
SHE BUYS ME
ALL KIND OF STUFF
FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD.

11:49.475 --> 11:51.610
IT'S NOT REALLY
MY STYLE, BUT...

11:51.610 --> 11:54.280
UH, CLEAN-UP AISLE
YOUR MOUTH.

11:54.280 --> 12:00.553
CAN'T YOU SEE YOURSELF
DISHING ABOUT BOYS
IN THIS FRESH ENSEMBLE?

12:01.053 --> 12:02.321
HEY, YEAH.

12:02.321 --> 12:04.490
I DO LOOK
KIND OF FRESH, DON'T I?

12:04.490 --> 12:07.359
SO DOES ANYBODY ELSE
THINK KYLE WILKINS

12:07.359 --> 12:09.562
IS A SNACKALICIOUS
COMBO PLATTER

12:09.562 --> 12:11.363
WITH EXTRA HOTTIE SAUCE?

12:11.363 --> 12:13.499
SSS. SIZZLING, GIRL.

12:13.499 --> 12:16.569
HE'S A MAJOR
ORLANDO IN BLOOM.

12:16.569 --> 12:19.705
[GIRLS GIGGLING]

12:27.279 --> 12:29.749
WHOO! THAT FACIAL WAS
THE BUSINESS, RIGHT?

12:29.749 --> 12:32.418
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE
WE DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.819
CHEERLEADERS NEVER PAY.

12:33.819 --> 12:35.588
WE BRING IN
TITANIC BUSINESS, OK?

12:35.588 --> 12:37.823
PEOPLE GO THERE
'CAUSE WE GO THERE.

12:37.823 --> 12:39.492
YEAH. THE DAY
I PAY FOR FACIALS

12:39.492 --> 12:42.394
IS THE DAY I BELIEVE
LACEY'S AS GOOD A CO-CAPTAIN

12:42.394 --> 12:43.662
AS ME AND STACEY.

12:43.662 --> 12:45.464
OH, TOTES.

12:45.464 --> 12:47.466
ENOUGH
WITH THE BICKERING.

12:47.466 --> 12:50.870
OK, WANNABE, YOU'VE GOT
THE MOVES AND THE LOOK.

12:50.870 --> 12:52.872
NOW IT'S TIME TO CHECK
YOUR CHEERLEADER 'TUDE.

12:52.872 --> 12:56.442
THE NEXT PERSON WHO COMES
AROUND THAT CORNER,
RIP 'EM TO SHREDS.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.477
WHAT? I DON'T KNOW
IF I COULD--

12:58.477 --> 13:01.547
HEY, TRIX.
YOU LIKE MY NEW LOOK?

13:01.547 --> 13:04.583
WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
FINISH HIM ALREADY.

13:04.583 --> 13:10.422
WELL, THIS OUTFIT
CHAFES A LITTLE
ON THE RUMPUS REGION, BUT--

13:10.422 --> 13:13.692
YOU'VE NEEDED HELP
TYING YOUR SHOES
SINCE YOU WAS 5.

13:13.692 --> 13:16.529
YOUR FAVORITE TV SHOW
IS MR. PIGGY'S PLAYHOUSE.

13:16.529 --> 13:19.064
AND WHEN YOU BELCH OUT
BROWNIE RECIPES IN HOME EC,

13:19.064 --> 13:21.934
PEOPLE LAUGH AT YOU,
NOT WITH YOU, OK?

13:21.934 --> 13:24.904
SO HOLD THIS ALL DOWN.
1, GROW UP,

13:24.904 --> 13:26.906
AND 2, SCRAM.
BEAT IT.

13:26.906 --> 13:28.374
GET LOST!

13:28.374 --> 13:29.542
NICE, GIRL.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.444
YOU REALLY MASHED
THAT POTATO.

13:32.444 --> 13:33.846
GOOD WORK.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.849
TRIXIE. TRIX.

13:36.849 --> 13:40.419
THOSE THINGS YOU SAID
TO SPUD, AS HE PUT IT,

13:40.419 --> 13:44.590
"THEY WERE EXTRA HARSH
WITH A SIDE OF MEAN BEANS."

13:44.590 --> 13:47.893
WHAT? I PRETENDED
TO BE ONE OF THEM.

13:47.893 --> 13:49.094
ISN'T THAT THE PLAN?

13:49.094 --> 13:52.431
YEAH, BUT DO YOU HAVE
TO PRETEND SO HARD?

13:52.431 --> 13:55.935
HERE. WE'RE MIKING YOU
FOR THE SLEEPOVER TONIGHT.

13:55.935 --> 13:57.570
MIKING ME? FOR WHAT?

13:57.570 --> 13:59.338
UH, TO GET THE INFO
ON THE GORGONS.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.942
THE TWISTED SISTERS WHO
WANNA TURN THE WORLD TO STONE.

14:02.942 --> 14:04.176
RING ANY BELLS?

14:04.176 --> 14:07.413
UH, YEAH. RIGHT. RIGHT.

14:07.413 --> 14:11.717
AHEM. SO ANYWAY, GIRL...

14:14.420 --> 14:16.055
YO, WHAT IS ALL THIS?

14:16.055 --> 14:19.692
THE WAY YOU PEELED
POTATO BOY TODAY
MADE IT OFFICIAL.

14:19.692 --> 14:22.428
YOU'RE ONE OF US, GIRL.

14:22.428 --> 14:23.462
REALLY?

14:23.462 --> 14:25.865
TOTALLY. YOU RULE.

14:25.865 --> 14:29.568
I KNOW. LET'S PLAY
TRUTH OR DARE.

14:29.568 --> 14:30.970
TOTALLY.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.404
YOU GO FIRST, TRIX.

14:32.404 --> 14:35.708
AIIGHT. I PICK TRUTH.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.778
OK, IF YOU COULD KISS
ANY BOY IN THE SCHOOL,

14:39.778 --> 14:40.846
WHO WOULD IT BE?

14:40.846 --> 14:45.150
HMM. I GUESS
I'D HAVE TO PICK...

14:45.150 --> 14:46.418
SPUD?

14:46.418 --> 14:50.155
NO, NO, NO. NO. NO.
THAT'S JUST JOKES, BABY.

14:50.155 --> 14:54.994
HOLD UP. I GOT TO BOUNCE
TO THE LADIES ROOM REAL QUICK.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.565
ALONE.

15:01.634 --> 15:03.135
SPUD.

15:05.604 --> 15:08.107
TRIX, YOU OK?
WE LOST THE AUDIO.

15:08.107 --> 15:11.410
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
PRIVATE GIRL STUFF IN HERE.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.145
NOW, GET OUT OF HERE
BEFORE YOU BLOW MY COVER.

15:13.145 --> 15:16.482
YOUR COVER? OR YOUR STATUS
AS ONE OF THE GIRLS?

15:16.482 --> 15:19.485
LOOK, SPUD, IN CASE
YOU HADN'T NOTICED,
I AM A GIRL.

15:19.485 --> 15:23.923
AND GIRLS DON'T BETRAY
EACH OTHER'S SECRETS.

15:28.928 --> 15:31.430
HEY, YOU GUYS, WAIT UP!

15:31.430 --> 15:34.934
IS IT TIME
FOR THE SCAVENGER HUNT?

15:39.605 --> 15:41.807
HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON, Y'ALL?

15:41.807 --> 15:46.946
UH, SOMETHING TELLS ME
THIS AIN'T A SCAVENGER HUNT.

15:46.946 --> 15:53.652
I THINK THERE'S
SOME BAD BUSINESS
ABOUT TO GO DOWN, AND I--

15:53.652 --> 15:55.521
[GASPS]

15:55.521 --> 15:57.923
UH-OH.

15:59.224 --> 16:02.094
OH, LOOK, EURYALE.
A GUEST.

16:02.094 --> 16:05.831
LET'S TRY
TO MAKE HER WELCOME.

16:06.031 --> 16:08.600
HA-HA-HA-HA!
HA-HA-HA-HA!

16:12.972 --> 16:14.606
IT'S QUIET IN THERE.

16:14.606 --> 16:20.212
HOLD UP. GIRLS DON'T
ACTUALLY SLEEP AT SLEEPOVERS.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.582
Both: HUH?

16:23.582 --> 16:27.152
Grandfather: TRIXIE WAS OUR
ONE LEAK TO THE CHEERLEADERS.

16:27.152 --> 16:30.155
IF FURY HAS INDEED
SUMMONED THEM,
IT MAY BE TOO LATE.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.491
FU, DON'T YOU HAVE SOME
KIND OF SPELL OR POTION

16:32.491 --> 16:33.959
OR SOMETHING WE
CAN USE TO FIND HER?

16:33.959 --> 16:37.262
NOTHING THAT WOULDN'T TAKE
AT LEAST A DAY OR TWO
TO WHIP UP.

16:37.262 --> 16:40.799
YOU'RE OBSESSED
WITH THAT STACEY GIRL, HUH?

16:40.799 --> 16:45.137
Jake: YOU INVENTED
THIS THING TO TRACK
STACEY'S EVERY MOVE?

16:45.137 --> 16:48.607
GEESH. EVEN I'M NOT
THIS WEIRD ABOUT GIRLS.

16:48.607 --> 16:52.011
ACCORDING TO THE
GEO STACEYTRACKER 3.0,

16:52.011 --> 16:55.247
SHE'S SOMEONE OUT THERE.

16:56.882 --> 16:59.651
LET'S PICK UP
THE PACE, LADIES.

16:59.651 --> 17:02.988
I'M MISSING SOME SERIOUS
BEAUTY SLEEP HERE.

17:08.292 --> 17:09.895
TRIX?

17:09.895 --> 17:12.765
MINIONS, SEIZE THEM!

17:13.732 --> 17:15.099
UH...UH-OH.

17:15.099 --> 17:18.537
WHOA!

17:20.539 --> 17:23.575
EURYALE,
DON'T JUST STAND THERE.

17:23.575 --> 17:24.742
HELP ME.

17:24.742 --> 17:31.116
BUT FOR THE RECORD,
NOBODY LIKES A BOSSY BECKY.

17:37.589 --> 17:38.857
AT LAST.

17:38.857 --> 17:41.593
OUR SISTER.

17:43.629 --> 17:47.332
[GROANS] THAT ROCK
MADE MY SKIN SO DRY.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.835
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DON'T LIVE HERE.

17:49.835 --> 17:52.104
OR YOU COULD TRY
SAYING THANK YOU.

17:52.104 --> 17:56.308
EURYALE, MEDUSA,
TAKE MY HANDS.

18:00.646 --> 18:05.717
IT'S TIME TO BREAK UP
THIS LITTLE FAMILY REUNION.

18:23.102 --> 18:27.272
OK, SPUD, IT'S ALL YOU.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.275
HEY THERE, GORGONS.

18:30.275 --> 18:32.778
NO. IT CAN'T BE.

18:32.778 --> 18:35.347
IT LOOKS LIKE THE WARRIOR
WHO IMPRISONED US.

18:35.347 --> 18:39.184
NOW TASTE
YOUR OWN REFLECTIONS.

18:39.184 --> 18:43.322
UM, I FEEL LIKE THAT
COULD HAVE GONE BETTER.

18:43.322 --> 18:47.759
YOU, MINION, FINISH HIM.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.462
TRIX? WHOA!

18:53.665 --> 18:56.034
TRIXIE?

18:56.034 --> 18:57.302
TRIXIE, THANKS.

18:57.302 --> 19:00.739
WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:01.940 --> 19:03.175
TRIXIE, NO!

19:03.175 --> 19:05.911
IT'S ME. SPUD!

19:05.911 --> 19:08.247
WHAT ARE YOU
WAITING FOR, MINION?

19:08.247 --> 19:09.648
WILL YOU
FINISH HIM ALREADY?

19:09.648 --> 19:11.884
WHO DO YOU HANG OUT WITH
AFTER SCHOOL EVERY DAY

19:11.884 --> 19:14.353
WATCHING
MR. PIGGY'S PLAYHOUSE?

19:14.353 --> 19:16.121
ME. SPUD.

19:16.121 --> 19:17.322
SPUDINSKY.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.291
YOUR FRIEND.

19:21.026 --> 19:23.362
SP-SPUD?

19:23.362 --> 19:25.297
AAH!

19:26.064 --> 19:28.100
MY SPELL.
SHE BROKE MY SPELL.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.335
THAT'S RIGHT, FURY.
AND I'M ABOUT TO BREAK

19:30.335 --> 19:32.804
A WHOLE LOT
OF SOMETHING ELSE.

19:32.804 --> 19:34.373
NOBODY DEFIES ME.

19:34.373 --> 19:36.708
I AM FURY, RULER OF ALL.

19:36.708 --> 19:39.444
UH, EXCUSE ME.
WE RULE TOGETHER.

19:39.444 --> 19:41.280
YEAH. WHO DIED
AND MADE YOU QUEEN?

19:41.280 --> 19:45.317
MAN, THOSE GORGONS BICKER
WORSE THAN THE CHEER--

19:45.317 --> 19:46.418
HOLD UP.

19:46.418 --> 19:51.123
HEY, FURY, DIDN'T YOU SAY
YOU WERE MORE POWERFUL
THAN MEDUSA?

19:51.123 --> 19:55.194
'CAUSE IF YOU ASK ME,
SHE DESERVES TO RULE,
NOT YOU.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.329
YOU SAID YOU WERE
MORE POWERFUL?

19:57.329 --> 20:00.299
PLEASE. LIKE YOU COULD
EVER RULE WITHOUT ME.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.334
WELL, EVERYBODY
KNOWS MEDUSA.

20:02.334 --> 20:04.136
BUT WHAT THE HECK
IS A FURY?

20:04.136 --> 20:07.906
AND SINCE ONLY ONE
OF YOU CAN REALLY
BE HANDLING THINGS,

20:07.906 --> 20:09.208
WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE HER?

20:09.208 --> 20:10.943
WELL, GIRLFRIEND'S
GOT A POINT.

20:10.943 --> 20:14.446
BUT I AM THE MOST IMPORTANT
OF THE GORGON SISTERS.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.281
UM, REALITY CHECK,
SWEETIE.

20:16.281 --> 20:19.184
WE'RE JUST AS IMPORTANT
AS YOU ARE.

20:19.184 --> 20:20.352
I'M THE RULER.

20:20.352 --> 20:21.887
HELLO. I AM.

20:21.887 --> 20:23.755
I AM.

20:46.178 --> 20:49.214
TRIX, IT WORKED.

20:49.514 --> 20:51.750
Both: AAH!

20:55.787 --> 20:58.357
LIKE, ARE WE
IN THE HUDSON RIVER?

20:58.357 --> 21:02.527
I THINK WE WERE
SLEEPWALKING TOGETHER.

21:06.932 --> 21:10.335
SO YOU'VE HUNG UP
YOUR CHEER OUTFIT
FOR GOOD, HUH?

21:10.335 --> 21:12.337
YEAH. TURNS OUT
BEING ONE OF THE GIRLS

21:12.337 --> 21:14.306
WASN'T ALL THAT
AFTER ALL.

21:14.306 --> 21:16.408
DITTO WITH
MY SPARTACUS UNIFORM.

21:16.408 --> 21:19.211
THE WHOLE THING
JUST REEKS OF DESPERATION.

21:19.211 --> 21:21.179
DESPERATION AND B.O.

21:21.179 --> 21:23.849
THANKS FOR HANGING
WITH ME, GUYS.

21:23.849 --> 21:27.286
ESPECIALLY AFTER I KIND
OF ACTED BRAND-NEW.

21:27.286 --> 21:33.458
PLUS YOU KIND OF SAVED
OUR LIVES IN A MAJORLY
DRAMATIC FASHION.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.395
FROM NOW ON, ME AND SPUD
ARE GONNA BE THERE FOR YOU,

21:36.395 --> 21:38.797
EVEN TO TALK
ABOUT THE GIRL STUFF.

21:38.797 --> 21:39.564
OOH! OH, LOOK.

21:39.564 --> 21:43.068
ISN'T HE...KYLE WILKINS...

21:43.068 --> 21:46.305
SPREAD ON FINE
LIKE CHEESE AND...

21:46.305 --> 21:49.441
UH, SAVE IT
FOR THE LADIES, JAKEY.

21:49.441 --> 21:52.377
IF YOU COULD BE
BROUGHT BACK
FROM THE DARK SIDE,

21:52.377 --> 21:56.448
MAYBE THERE'S HOPE
FOR MY PRECIOUS STACEY, TOO.

21:56.448 --> 21:57.482
OH, EXCUSE ME. I--

21:57.482 --> 21:59.985
EWW. IT TOUCHED ME.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.053
AAH!

22:01.053 --> 22:04.189
OH, YEAH. SHE DIGS ME.

22:08.293 --> 22:12.331
HELLO, MOTHER.
IT'S YOUR FAVORITE SON.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.566
YOU KNOW. HANS.
ANYWAY, LISTEN.

22:14.566 --> 22:16.034
I'M IN JAIL AGAIN.

22:16.034 --> 22:17.936
BUT NOT FOR MISTAKING
A STUDENT FOR A DRAGON

22:17.936 --> 22:20.339
AND LOCKING HIM
IN THE BACK OF THE TRUCK
LIKE LAST TIME.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.607
NO. I KNOCKED OVER
A PRICELESS STATUE

22:22.607 --> 22:24.409
AT THE COSMOPOLITAN
MUSEUM OF ART.

22:24.409 --> 22:28.480
ANYWAY, I NEED YOU TO WIRE ME
THE BAIL MONEY QUICKLY.

22:28.480 --> 22:31.249
[PANTING] MY CELLMATE
CALLS HIMSELF "BEEF"

22:31.249 --> 22:34.486
AND TAKES MUCH PLEASURE
IN SHOWING ME HIS MANY TATTOOS.

22:34.486 --> 22:36.321
AUF WIEDERSEHEN.
