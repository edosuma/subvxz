00:05.638 --> 00:09.699
The Bible says God appeared to Moses
in the burning bush.

00:09.776 --> 00:12.643
He came to Jesus on a mountaintop.

00:12.712 --> 00:16.773
For Buddha, God came
while he sat under a tree.

00:17.817 --> 00:23.813
God came to me in a vision in the desert,
February 26, 1991.

00:25.000 --> 00:31.074

00:35.201 --> 00:36.862
God.

00:37.904 --> 00:43.206
My recon squad had engaged Saddam's army
in a small Bedouin encampment.

00:43.309 --> 00:49.077
We'd been ambushed, taken on by surprise.
And there were casualties.

00:49.149 --> 00:52.744
- l can't feel my legs.
- You're gonna be OK.

00:56.156 --> 00:59.489
Get on the radio.
We need some help here.

00:59.559 --> 01:03.256
Zulu six-two, we are under attack.
Repeat: we are under attack.

01:03.363 --> 01:06.560
We are taking heavy machine-gun fire.

01:06.666 --> 01:10.158
We were holding our perimeter,
and we might have held up,

01:10.236 --> 01:13.262
but on this day l had
a terrible sense of foreboding.

01:13.373 --> 01:19.744
l saw the future of those brave men,
and they were about to die.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.616
Death came to take my men,

01:31.691 --> 01:33.750
but not me.

01:35.762 --> 01:39.129
l was left as a witness to a vision.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.928
Angels from heaven.

02:27.347 --> 02:33.013
''Behold, a whirlwind came out of the north,
and a brightness was about it.''

02:33.820 --> 02:38.621
''And out of the midst came
the likeness of four living creatures.''

02:38.691 --> 02:41.319
''And they had the likeness of a man.''

02:52.539 --> 02:55.303
l knew why my life had been spared.

02:55.375 --> 03:01.803
l was to deliver the message of these angels,
of these sons of God.

03:01.881 --> 03:07.615
To deliver the message of the god
who came before all other gods.

03:54.133 --> 03:57.967
At seven o'clock this evening,
in a Washington, DC alley,

03:58.037 --> 04:01.200
the vehicle carrying
the son of Agent Dana Scully

04:01.274 --> 04:07.702
was forced to a stop by a female shooter, who
proceeded to kidnap the child at gunpoint.

04:07.780 --> 04:14.151
The van was being driven by three men,
asked by Agent Scully to protect the child.

04:14.254 --> 04:18.588
The three men are currently working
to lD the assailant.

04:35.575 --> 04:40.603
John Doggett was seriously injured
by the same female shooter

04:40.680 --> 04:42.773
as he tried to halt her vehicle.

04:42.849 --> 04:48.845
Agent Doggett remains in a coma,
under close watch at St Mary's Hospital.

04:50.089 --> 04:53.616
This kidnapping follows
a failed attack on Scully's child

04:53.693 --> 04:55.752
by another FBl agent, Robert Comer.

04:55.828 --> 05:00.492
He remains in critical condition,
also at St Mary's.

05:00.600 --> 05:07.768
This man's motives, and the motives
of the female kidnapper, are still unknown.

05:08.308 --> 05:13.610
Let me emphasize that the FBl
has no reason to believe

05:13.680 --> 05:19.141
that it cannot effect the safe return
of Agent Scully's child.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.147
Agent Scully.

05:26.826 --> 05:31.320
- l told you you didn't need to be here.
- l just had to see this for myself.

05:35.902 --> 05:39.531
- Go home.
- To what?

05:39.639 --> 05:43.473
You don't need to put yourself through this.

05:43.543 --> 05:48.674
We've got every stop pulled, every
available agent working to find your son.

05:52.418 --> 05:56.878
And AD Brad Follmer leading the charge.

05:56.989 --> 06:00.982
Kersh asked him. He knows how to run
a task force. You see that in there.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.995
l see a man who
withholds information for Kersh,

06:04.063 --> 06:09.365
a man who not once but twice
failed to prevent an attack on my son.

06:09.435 --> 06:14.395
You see a task force in there.
l see a whitewash.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.668
l know you're upset,

06:16.743 --> 06:22.409
but you can't possibly accuse Follmer
or Kersh of having any part in this.

06:22.515 --> 06:25.177
What is it gonna take for you?

06:26.219 --> 06:31.418
How many people have to be taken out
for you to open your eyes to it?

06:31.524 --> 06:35.517
My son. Agent Doggett.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.028
Mulder.

06:37.096 --> 06:42.557
Kersh protected you by not telling you
of Mulder's death, as did Follmer - as did l.

06:42.635 --> 06:45.229
You call it protection.

06:47.573 --> 06:52.977
l call it a systematic effort
inside the FBl to eliminate us.

06:53.079 --> 06:59.814
You accuse anyone of anything in the FBl,
you have to accuse me along with them.

07:05.925 --> 07:10.089
- Scully, where are you going?
- To find my son.

07:34.821 --> 07:37.255
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:41.694 --> 07:44.128
His hands are so cold.

07:45.798 --> 07:49.256
Have you talked to the doctors yet?

07:49.335 --> 07:54.204
They say the good news is that
there's no swelling of the brain.

07:54.307 --> 07:58.801
But they were very frank
that he could just never wake up.

08:03.816 --> 08:05.784
l wonder if he can hear us.

08:07.787 --> 08:10.779
There'd be soldiers in Vietnam,

08:12.625 --> 08:14.820
bodies turned inside out.

08:16.829 --> 08:20.856
l'd hold their hands just like you're doing.

08:22.468 --> 08:24.902
Tell them it was gonna be OK.

08:26.138 --> 08:28.299
Do you think it helped?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.401
Talking to them?

08:34.714 --> 08:39.309
l always thought it was like praying.

08:42.221 --> 08:47.022
Even if they can't hear, maybe God can.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.205
- Hello?
- How's he doing?

09:02.775 --> 09:04.868
No change.

09:05.711 --> 09:10.080
l need to see you right away, Monica.
Are you alone right now?

09:10.182 --> 09:12.047
Skinner's here with me.

09:13.019 --> 09:15.283
l'd prefer if Skinner didn't know.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.357
- We found her.
- Who?

09:22.428 --> 09:24.919
The woman that took William.

09:26.632 --> 09:32.229
She's a wanted felon, and part of the UFO cult
that the FBl was investigating.

09:32.305 --> 09:36.867
l need anything that you can find on her,
but l need you to get it quietly.

09:36.943 --> 09:41.312
Access denied?
We'll see about that.

09:43.082 --> 09:46.381
lf they lD'd the woman,
why isn't the FBl investigating it?

09:46.452 --> 09:49.387
l asked them not to tell the FBl.

09:52.258 --> 09:56.490
- What are you doing?
- l'm trying to get my son back.

09:57.964 --> 10:01.127
- We're locked on.
- Like there was ever a doubt.

10:01.233 --> 10:05.294
Which brings us closer to finding William.
Langly's inside the system.

10:05.404 --> 10:10.569
l'm hacked inside the phone company. l'll use
their mainframe to scan for a locator signal.

10:10.643 --> 10:15.671
Before William was kidnapped, Byers tucked
a cellphone under the baby's car seat.

10:15.781 --> 10:20.844
Call the phone, and Langly can use the signal
to find its location and find the baby.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.013
Assuming the kidnapper
hasn't found the phone.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.452
We'll keep trying.

10:41.173 --> 10:45.769
This is madness, and you know it. They failed
you once, they're gonna fail you again.

10:45.845 --> 10:48.370
- Then l'll find him myself.
- Not alone.

10:48.481 --> 10:52.474
Look, what alternative do l have,

10:52.551 --> 10:57.511
when the FBl is all but telling me
they think that my son is already dead?

10:57.623 --> 11:03.493
We've got a signal. ln Warfordsburg,
Pennsylvania, off the interstate.

11:04.730 --> 11:08.291
You coming with me?
Or am l going alone?

12:06.926 --> 12:10.953
- Have you got him?
- Yes. He's safe. We're here.

12:11.063 --> 12:15.363
We need to go carefully now.
l want you to stay where you are.

12:15.434 --> 12:18.870
- l'm sending someone to get you, all right?
- Yes.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.242
lt's moving.

12:59.078 --> 13:01.603
Can you hear me?

13:01.680 --> 13:04.911
l need some tools. Go get some tools.

13:04.984 --> 13:07.179
Move it.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.364
Federal agent.

14:04.176 --> 14:08.738
John Doggett, where is he?
He's not in his bed.

14:11.217 --> 14:14.084
They've taken him to Radiology
to run a CAT scan.

14:14.186 --> 14:21.024
- Would you like me to call his doctor?
- No, l was just worried. l'm sorry.

15:08.941 --> 15:11.535
- What?
- Nothing.

15:12.878 --> 15:19.408
l've known you a long time, and this
just seems a little traditional for you.

15:20.586 --> 15:25.319
Maybe when you're lost you knock
at the door with the porch light on.

15:25.424 --> 15:27.483
Hey.

15:30.296 --> 15:35.165
l want you to know, l'm doing all l can
to find the woman who did this.

15:35.267 --> 15:40.762
Even though we've got people
inside the FBl working against us.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.477
That was foolish,
going after her by yourselves.

15:49.581 --> 15:55.816
We could have been there before you, even
captured the suspect. lnstead she got away.

15:55.921 --> 15:59.516
- This is complicated. lf you came to bust...
- No.

15:59.625 --> 16:03.254
l came here to ask for your cooperation.

16:04.863 --> 16:08.856
Not sharing information
creates an atmosphere of distrust.

16:08.968 --> 16:13.837
Then l'm less apt
to share my information with you.

16:13.939 --> 16:17.033
What haven't you shared with me?

16:20.045 --> 16:24.709
This FBl agent who tried to kill
Scully's baby has come around.

16:24.817 --> 16:28.344
He's got something he wants to tell us.

16:28.454 --> 16:30.388
What?

16:30.489 --> 16:32.480
l need your cooperation.

16:51.510 --> 16:56.914
You said he tried to tell you something.
How was that possible?

17:00.519 --> 17:04.478
He didn't tell me, exactly.
He wrote it down.

17:08.761 --> 17:11.093
l don't know what this means.

17:11.195 --> 17:16.862
l don't know either. But it means something,
and l want to know what.

17:26.377 --> 17:30.542
- Just tell me where you got this.
- You know what it means?

17:30.616 --> 17:33.380
Robert Comer wrote this, didn't he?

17:34.420 --> 17:38.550
The FBl agent who tried to kill my son.
And how did you get it?

17:38.624 --> 17:43.561
l got it under the condition
that l share what l learn from you.

17:43.629 --> 17:47.065
- Take it.
- What is it? What does it mean?

17:47.132 --> 17:50.067
lf l don't tell you, you're good on your word.

17:50.135 --> 17:55.232
That means that you've learnt
absolutely nothing from me.

17:57.976 --> 18:00.308
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.

18:00.412 --> 18:02.607
lt doesn't work that way.

18:02.714 --> 18:07.651
This began when the agent lying
in that hospital crashed his motorcycle.

18:07.753 --> 18:13.214
Somehow he got to Washington without
a scratch and he tried to kill my son.

18:13.292 --> 18:16.386
Tell me, how did he do that?

18:18.263 --> 18:21.255
With something l found in his jacket pocket,

18:21.333 --> 18:26.794
in ajacket that he wore to my house,
that l put three shots in.

18:28.407 --> 18:31.501
The artifact. The piece of the ship.

19:35.841 --> 19:38.332
- Let go.
- My God.

19:39.244 --> 19:41.303
Let go of my hand.

19:43.081 --> 19:47.518
Turn off the monitors
or they're gonna alert somebody.

20:12.077 --> 20:16.343
Tell me, who sent you to kill my son?

20:16.415 --> 20:22.411
Or l will take that pillow from under your head
and make them the last breaths that you take.

20:22.521 --> 20:25.684
Your son has to die.

20:29.261 --> 20:32.424
Not what you think. Please.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.760
Please.

20:36.201 --> 20:41.537
The FBl sent me undercover on a man
named Josepho, to get inside his cult,

20:41.607 --> 20:46.806
whose followers believe
an alien race will rule the world.

20:48.480 --> 20:52.610
One day, God told Josepho
to lead us 1,000 miles north

20:52.718 --> 20:54.913
to find a ship buried in the ground.

20:54.987 --> 20:58.047
You have a piece of that ship in your hand.

20:58.123 --> 21:05.620
Josepho believes that that ship is a temple
housing the physical manifestation of God.

21:07.399 --> 21:11.597
Are you saying that God
asked you to kill my child?

21:11.670 --> 21:13.604
No.

21:13.672 --> 21:17.733
Josepho said God spoke to him
of a miracle child,

21:17.809 --> 21:22.439
a future savior,
coveted by forces of good and evil.

21:22.514 --> 21:27.679
- Josepho believes your son is this child.
- Why does he want to kill him?

21:27.786 --> 21:31.119
He doesn't. He wants to protect him.

21:32.257 --> 21:36.023
Josepho believes your son
will follow in his father's paths

21:36.128 --> 21:39.097
and try to stop the aliens' return,

21:41.033 --> 21:43.968
unless his father was to be killed.

21:44.036 --> 21:47.164
That is the prophecy.

21:47.272 --> 21:53.177
You came here to kill her son,
against this man and his cult? To stop them?

21:53.278 --> 21:56.441
Are you saying you believe this prophecy
but acted alone?

21:56.515 --> 22:00.542
What he's saying is that Mulder is dead.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.485
That that's true.

22:04.022 --> 22:06.957
That they killed him to fulfill this prophecy.

22:07.025 --> 22:11.223
And that your son must die too.

22:11.330 --> 22:16.529
Or everyone, all of mankind,
will perish from Earth.

22:20.205 --> 22:24.039
Please. Please, let me...

22:24.142 --> 22:26.201
Please.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.644
What is going on here?

22:35.754 --> 22:37.915
What are you doing in here?

22:37.989 --> 22:41.686
They turned off all the monitors.
They removed his intubation.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.352
What are you doing in here?

22:43.428 --> 22:48.024
This patient does not need support.
He's breathing on his own.

22:49.668 --> 22:52.000
Step outside. Both of you.

22:54.272 --> 22:56.103
Let's go.

23:00.612 --> 23:03.513
Get me ADs Follmer and Skinner.

23:26.471 --> 23:28.962
lt's not working.

23:42.387 --> 23:44.582
- You weren't followed?
- No.

23:53.965 --> 23:58.095
He's safe now.
He's safe with us.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.365
Where's Scully and Reyes?

25:07.472 --> 25:10.532
They were told to wait out here.

25:12.344 --> 25:18.146
Assistant Director?
We need Scully and Reyes, now.

25:28.927 --> 25:31.521
- What are we gonna tell them?
- Who?

25:31.596 --> 25:37.228
The FBl. About Agent Comer. About what
just happened. About how he was healed.

25:37.335 --> 25:39.826
Just tell them the truth.

25:39.905 --> 25:44.604
They're not on our side.
They will use the truth against us.

25:44.709 --> 25:50.341
You don't believe what you heard in there?
What that man was telling you?

25:50.415 --> 25:52.576
How could you doubt him?

25:52.684 --> 25:57.417
After everything that you've just witnessed,
after what you saw with my son?

25:57.522 --> 26:02.357
This is exactly what l feared,
that there's something terribly wrong.

26:02.427 --> 26:05.863
From the very moment
that he was conceived.

26:06.631 --> 26:09.896
Your child was a miracle.

26:09.968 --> 26:12.903
The things l've witnessed
are no less miraculous,

26:12.971 --> 26:19.740
but your son is not an abomination,
a thing that should cease to exist.

26:19.811 --> 26:25.443
You tell me on that ship is written scripture
from the world's great religions.

26:25.550 --> 26:29.042
Tell me a religion
that decrees the death of a child.

26:29.120 --> 26:32.112
Notjust your child, but any child.

26:32.958 --> 26:36.086
This is a man saying these things to us.

26:36.161 --> 26:41.997
How many religions warn of false prophets,
men sent to deceive us?

26:42.100 --> 26:46.059
The only thing that l believe
is that your son may still be alive,

26:46.137 --> 26:49.265
and we can find him and save him.

26:50.408 --> 26:55.345
And with that object in that room,
we can save Agent Doggett too.

26:59.985 --> 27:03.079
You two better get outta here.

27:04.522 --> 27:07.650
- Agent Comer's dead.
- What?

27:18.370 --> 27:21.100
This man was alive.

27:21.172 --> 27:23.436
You saw him. He was alive.

27:31.016 --> 27:35.885
- Somebody was in here. Where did it go?
- Where did what go?

27:35.987 --> 27:38.717
This man had something in his hand,
a piece of metal.

27:38.823 --> 27:41.815
lt's why he could be taken off life-support.

27:41.893 --> 27:45.021
A piece of metal?
l don't know what she's talking about.

27:45.130 --> 27:48.327
- Who else came into this room?
- Why are you questioning me?

27:48.400 --> 27:51.699
- Did you leave the room?
- Agent Reyes.

27:51.803 --> 27:55.466
This woman came in here
and this man was alive.

27:55.540 --> 28:00.534
He was more than alive. He'd been healed,
he'd been brought back to life.

28:00.645 --> 28:05.378
- This man was murdered, but it wasn't by us.
- Agent Reyes.

28:06.317 --> 28:08.512
Who else was in here?

28:09.554 --> 28:12.819
- You were in here.
- l came in and found you.

28:13.324 --> 28:15.519
Were you alone in here?

28:15.593 --> 28:19.859
- Was he alone in here?
- She went to get the doctors.

28:20.498 --> 28:22.159
- Search this man.
- For what?

28:22.233 --> 28:23.996
Monica.

28:24.069 --> 28:26.663
Scully saw it. Ask Agent Scully.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.007
Agent Scully?

28:31.042 --> 28:33.340
Where's Scully?

28:35.180 --> 28:37.705
Agent Scully.

28:44.355 --> 28:47.620
l never meant for this,

28:47.726 --> 28:50.217
all that's been lost.

28:51.896 --> 28:56.890
l never meant to put you at risk,
to risk losing you too.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.063
She's fighting for you.

29:04.242 --> 29:07.643
Monica's out there trying to find a way.

29:08.713 --> 29:11.614
And she's not going to let you go.

29:12.717 --> 29:14.651
Agent Scully.

29:15.720 --> 29:17.881
Agent Doggett.

29:20.091 --> 29:24.653
- l heard someone talking.
- That was me. That was me talking to you.

29:24.763 --> 29:26.560
No, it wasn't you.

29:29.501 --> 29:35.804
They're gonna come to you, but you can't
trust them. Do you understand that?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.839
Scully.

29:42.013 --> 29:43.640
My God.

29:53.158 --> 29:54.182
Scully.

29:54.292 --> 29:59.252
Listen carefully, Agent Scully.
You want to see your son?

29:59.798 --> 30:04.792
You come alone. You follow
my instructions to the letter.

30:42.907 --> 30:48.539
Sorry to keep you waiting,
but l had to make sure you were alone.

30:48.646 --> 30:52.480
l only wish to protect the boy
from those who'd harm him.

30:52.550 --> 30:55.246
He's a very special boy.

30:55.353 --> 30:58.083
l came here to take him back.

30:59.858 --> 31:05.728
''Behold, a whirlwind came out of the north,
and a brightness was about it.''

31:05.830 --> 31:09.891
''And out of the midst came
the likeness of four living creatures.''

31:10.001 --> 31:12.526
''And they had the likeness of a man.''

31:12.604 --> 31:15.368
That's the Bible. Did you know it?

31:15.440 --> 31:17.499
Ephesians.

31:18.243 --> 31:22.839
The Bible, describing giants
who walked the Earth.

31:22.914 --> 31:26.042
Who'd believe it? Only the faithful.

31:26.117 --> 31:31.953
And we who have seen them,
these super-soldiers,

31:32.056 --> 31:34.388
the true sons of God.

31:35.760 --> 31:38.695
l want to see my son.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.291
You struggle to believe.

31:44.435 --> 31:49.702
lt's so incredible, but your son
will lead this alien race.

31:49.774 --> 31:52.868
He was put here to lead.

31:55.914 --> 32:02.183
l'll bring you to him, to see your son,
after you do something for me.

32:02.253 --> 32:05.313
After you bring something l need.

32:08.126 --> 32:11.220
Confirmation that Mulder's dead.

32:13.431 --> 32:15.422
You killed Mulder.

32:15.500 --> 32:17.058
No.

32:17.735 --> 32:23.196
l believed he was dead,
but now l have reason to doubt that.

32:26.077 --> 32:32.073
And if he's alive, he's the one thing
preventing your son's true destiny.

32:32.150 --> 32:35.085
You told me l could see my son.

32:37.855 --> 32:40.289
You lied.

32:40.692 --> 32:45.925
lf you want to see the boy,
you'll bring me the head of Fox Mulder.

33:06.517 --> 33:08.280
Get ready.

33:08.353 --> 33:09.615
Hold on.

33:16.461 --> 33:19.362
- His car's wired.
- Here we go.

33:57.268 --> 34:00.362
They say he's a mile ahead,
turning off the highway.

34:00.438 --> 34:04.067
What about these hills?
Are we gonna lose him in these hills?

34:05.610 --> 34:09.101
Yeah. How are we in terrain?

34:09.213 --> 34:12.545
That transponder'll track him
driving underwater to Brazil.

34:12.617 --> 34:14.107
Langly.

34:15.753 --> 34:18.244
Whatjust happened?

34:19.556 --> 34:21.855
We're coming to a turn. ls this it?

34:21.926 --> 34:23.449
Yeah.

34:24.962 --> 34:26.020
Turn.

34:30.902 --> 34:35.032
- l think they lost the signal.
- They have to get it back.

34:35.106 --> 34:37.040
Piece of crap.

34:37.108 --> 34:40.804
- Louder, why don't ya?
- Tell them we're working on it.

34:40.911 --> 34:42.812
Here. You be the messenger.

35:08.172 --> 35:10.504
What is it? What's happening?

35:10.608 --> 35:14.738
The baby started crying
and itjust came to life.

35:29.660 --> 35:33.528
Hey, guys. We lost him.
And we just ran out of road out here.

35:33.631 --> 35:35.258
William?

35:37.435 --> 35:38.527
William.

36:36.427 --> 36:37.985
William.

36:56.514 --> 36:58.573
No.

37:34.885 --> 37:36.944
Oh, my God.

37:43.894 --> 37:45.953
Dana.

37:57.174 --> 37:59.267
William?

39:06.344 --> 39:11.509
l came to give you a ride home.
They told me you were in here.

39:11.582 --> 39:13.675
Yeah.

39:18.689 --> 39:21.658
l came in here and prayed for you.

39:22.727 --> 39:24.524
Yeah, l know.

39:28.232 --> 39:33.693
This voice in my head,
it was talking to me.

39:33.771 --> 39:39.539
Telling me to get up, telling me
to warn Scully about this man.

39:41.445 --> 39:45.848
l mean, was it you talking to me?

39:48.085 --> 39:51.213
l only prayed for your life.

40:08.439 --> 40:10.532
Deputy Director?

40:12.710 --> 40:14.541
Mr Follmer.

40:14.612 --> 40:18.480
Sir, it's about that report you have there.

40:19.583 --> 40:23.644
The investigation of
Special Agent Robert Comer's death.

40:23.754 --> 40:25.085
Yes?

40:26.290 --> 40:31.990
AD Skinner refused to sign it,
believing that Agent Comer was murdered.

40:32.096 --> 40:35.998
But you did sign it.
lsn't that right, Mr Follmer?

40:36.100 --> 40:39.968
Finding nothing to support that allegation.

40:40.070 --> 40:42.300
That's just it, sir.

40:43.574 --> 40:45.838
l did find something.

40:47.478 --> 40:53.110
The monitors in Agent Comer's room, they
recorded his condition, moment by moment,

40:53.184 --> 41:00.352
showing that his vital signs did improve
just before his equipment was unplugged.

41:01.959 --> 41:07.124
They did, in fact, return back to normal.

41:07.798 --> 41:10.164
And you have an explanation for that?

41:10.267 --> 41:12.292
No, sir, l don't.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.297
And you want what?

41:18.008 --> 41:21.273
l just want to take my name off it.

41:21.345 --> 41:28.444
Maybe if you weren't so busy back-pedalling,
Mr Follmer, you might get me an explanation.

41:30.855 --> 41:33.153
Excuse me.

41:43.534 --> 41:46.367
l'm sure you heard all of that.

41:53.744 --> 42:00.013
Congratulations. lt would appear now
that everything is dead but this case.

42:08.926 --> 42:13.192
l'm sure l can take care of that,
Deputy Director.

42:13.264 --> 42:15.357
Quite sure.
