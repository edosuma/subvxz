- Hey.

00:06.798 --> 00:08.591
- Hey, how are you?
- Muah.

00:08.675 --> 00:10.635
Hey, you want to go to Chelsea
Pier tonight, just you and me?

00:10.719 --> 00:12.762
Oh, she can't, we are having
a girls' night out.

00:12.846 --> 00:15.098
Really? Well, uh,
what might be happening

00:15.181 --> 00:18.518
at this girls' night out?

00:18.601 --> 00:20.603
Probably get something to eat,
see a movie

00:20.687 --> 00:23.440
then head back to my place,
maybe listen to some music.

00:23.523 --> 00:25.608
Then maybe Tina will say
something that makes me

00:25.692 --> 00:28.111
a little angry,
and I'll hit her with a pillow

00:28.194 --> 00:31.614
and then she will hit me back,
and, uh, I'll hit her again

00:31.698 --> 00:33.575
and eventually
we'll just fall into each other

00:33.658 --> 00:36.536
and share a tentative
awkward kiss.

00:38.413 --> 00:41.833
I will pay you $5
to say that last part again.

00:41.916 --> 00:43.752
- You're okay with that, right?
- Yeah, totally cool.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.628
Maybe I'll just hang out
with you tonight.

00:45.712 --> 00:47.714
Oh, okay, but if you try to
awkward kiss me

of boys' night out.

- Okay, that's enough guessing.

- It's Peter. He's number two.
- Oh!

Ooh, wow, that is a really good
picture of him.

- Almost as much as you do.

we could hang out.

co-signed a loan for me.

to this stupid thing

I didn't write that stupid note.

to buy me a dress, too.

that he stopped you from going

do something drastic.

10:18.576 --> 10:19.827
Do you know
how much it would've hurt him

10:19.910 --> 10:20.995
if I had told him the truth?

10:21.078 --> 10:22.955
No, no, this is all good.

10:23.039 --> 10:24.373
Henry's happy, I'm happy.

10:24.457 --> 10:26.625
Front row seats. It's all good.

10:26.709 --> 10:30.296
Well, you just said
lying was wrong.

10:30.379 --> 10:32.423
And you always tell the truth?

10:32.506 --> 10:33.716
Yes, I do.

10:33.799 --> 10:35.551
And I hope that
you would never lie to me

10:35.634 --> 10:38.262
just to spare my feelings.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.264
- I hate your third earring.
- Oh!

10:42.350 --> 10:44.143
Uh-huh. Lame.

10:44.226 --> 10:47.855
No, this is not lame.
This is cool.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.857
Yeah, it might be cool
if you had a time machine

10:49.940 --> 10:53.152
to take you back to the '80s.

10:53.235 --> 10:55.071
Oh, oh, okay.

10:55.154 --> 10:59.575
You know what, I wish I had one
of those freeze-time machines.

10:59.658 --> 11:03.079
That way I could freeze the time
you told me you liked it.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.498
I was sparing your feelings.
See?

11:05.581 --> 11:07.583
Yesterday, you were walking
around all happy

11:07.666 --> 11:09.251
with your third hole,
and now look at you

11:09.335 --> 11:12.213
bummed out, wishing
you had a freeze-time machine.

11:12.296 --> 11:15.174
Sometimes, the truth
is just plain bad.

11:16.842 --> 11:18.469
- I don't like that robe.
- Me neither.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.596
You gave it to me for Christmas.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.649
Okay. So, you want to sell me
tickets at full price

11:31.732 --> 11:34.110
to a concert I wouldn't buy
tickets for in the first place?

11:34.193 --> 11:35.611
It's okay,
they're in the very last row

11:35.694 --> 11:38.739
so you won't even be
able to hear or see them.

11:38.823 --> 11:39.865
Not me.

11:39.949 --> 11:41.784
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, nothing.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.953
I got two tickets
to the Strokes concert.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.455
I know. Front row.
How stoked are you?

11:46.539 --> 11:47.998
Alright, Holly told you?

11:48.082 --> 11:49.792
Told me? Dude, I was there.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.794
I'm going to be sitting
right next to you.

11:51.877 --> 11:54.213
Listen, sorry I couldn't
get you into sound check

11:54.296 --> 11:56.465
but you understand,
the only way I could get in

11:56.549 --> 11:58.050
was if I brought cute girls.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.761
But don't worry.
She totally behaved herself.

12:02.555 --> 12:03.806
You guys going to be
here for a while?

12:03.889 --> 12:05.266
- Yeah, we'll be right here.
- Yeah.

12:05.349 --> 12:07.601
Be right back.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.353
Hey, look, I'm sure
there's an explanation.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.479
She lied to me.

12:10.563 --> 12:12.898
Well, that,
there's your explanation.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.025
She gave me all that crap
about girls' night out

12:15.109 --> 12:16.610
and then she hung out
with Vince.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.154
And then she lied to me
about it.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.905
Do you know
how that makes me feel?

12:19.989 --> 12:21.824
- Well, probably like--
- You don't know how I feel.

12:21.907 --> 12:24.326
You don't have any idea!

12:24.410 --> 12:27.663
- Okay.
- You know what this calls for?

12:27.746 --> 12:29.999
A big fat lie.

12:30.082 --> 12:32.293
Or you-you can ask Vince
to step outside

12:32.376 --> 12:34.044
and he can beat your ass.

12:38.757 --> 12:39.675
[knock on door]

12:39.758 --> 12:40.926
(Holly)
'One sec.'

12:43.095 --> 12:45.014
Hey, Henry. Muah.

12:45.097 --> 12:47.183
So, I was thinking we could
get sushi before the concert--

12:47.266 --> 12:49.101
Holly.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.519
We have to talk.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.438
Okay, what's up?

12:53.939 --> 12:55.608
Come here, you should sit down.

12:55.691 --> 12:57.818
Okay.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.361
What's happening?

12:59.445 --> 13:03.866
Okay, Holly, I know
that you would never lie to me

13:03.949 --> 13:06.619
so I-I never want to lie to you.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.499
Um, when I told you the story

13:11.582 --> 13:13.375
about how I got the tickets

13:13.459 --> 13:16.712
I didn't exactly
tell you everything.

13:16.795 --> 13:17.838
Okay.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.548
So, last night

13:19.632 --> 13:23.385
when you were out
with the girls, I..

13:23.469 --> 13:26.138
Oh, this is so hard.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.433
It's okay. Just, just tell me.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.684
Okay.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.521
Last night

13:33.604 --> 13:37.233
I bumped into an old girlfriend.

13:37.316 --> 13:41.529
And she and I started
talking about old times.

13:41.612 --> 13:45.282
And then we kinda
went for coffee.

13:45.366 --> 13:48.619
- Oh.
- No, I know, I felt so bad.

13:48.702 --> 13:51.997
I mean, you were at home dialing
your little finger to the bone

13:52.081 --> 13:56.043
and I was out with my ex,
on boys' night out, no less.

13:57.211 --> 13:59.213
Baby, it was just coffee, right?

13:59.296 --> 14:01.882
I can't lie.

14:01.966 --> 14:05.553
You're too good. I..
You deserve the truth.

14:07.221 --> 14:10.266
The fact is, it kind of

14:10.349 --> 14:12.184
stirred up some feelings.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.143
What?

14:13.227 --> 14:15.271
[telephone rings]

14:15.354 --> 14:17.940
It's okay. Get it.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.109
I need to gather my thoughts.

14:25.531 --> 14:26.615
Hello?

14:26.699 --> 14:28.659
Holly, listen,
H-Henry's my friend

14:28.742 --> 14:30.244
and I know
I shouldn't be doing this

14:30.327 --> 14:31.954
but, well, you're my friend too,
and I've known you longer

14:32.037 --> 14:34.164
so I have to warn you. Henry,
he knows about everything.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.208
He knows about Vince,
he knows how you got the tickets

14:36.292 --> 14:37.668
and-and he's on his way
over there.

14:37.751 --> 14:40.296
Girl, he's mad, and I don't know
what he's going to do.

14:40.379 --> 14:43.132
Oh, I do. Thank you very much.

14:44.758 --> 14:48.762
Sorry about that, so, you were
saying that she stirred up

14:48.846 --> 14:52.391
some kind of feelings?
What kind of feelings?

14:52.474 --> 14:54.226
Well..

14:54.310 --> 14:57.521
You know...emotional ones.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.774
Oh, my God.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.359
Are you breaking up with me?

15:02.443 --> 15:04.486
What? No.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.739
[hyperventilating]

15:06.822 --> 15:08.866
- Oh, my God, I can't breathe.
- Wha..

15:09.450 --> 15:11.493
Oh.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.663
[panting]
Oh, my God, I think
I'm going to pass out.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.665
Okay, um, just, uh..

15:16.749 --> 15:18.792
Put, put your head
between your knees.

15:20.419 --> 15:22.254
I think I'm going to die.

15:24.673 --> 15:27.718
The thought of you
being with that woman..

15:27.801 --> 15:30.012
No, no! No.

15:30.095 --> 15:31.597
Holly, listen to me..

15:31.680 --> 15:33.015
[cell phone ringing]

15:33.098 --> 15:35.809
Holly. Holly.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.353
Ugh! Stupid phone.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.564
Get it! I don't come
first anymore, anyway.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.028
Hello?

15:46.111 --> 15:47.446
Uh, look, man

15:47.529 --> 15:49.281
I think I screwed up.

15:49.365 --> 15:50.991
I-I told Holly
that you knew about the tickets.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.451
Now, I didn't want
to sell you out.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.078
I was just afraid
you'd do something crazy.

15:54.161 --> 15:55.788
Then I felt really guilty.
Do you think that's weird?

15:55.871 --> 15:58.374
Hey, don't tell Holly
I told you, huh?

15:58.457 --> 16:00.542
Oh, okay, goodbye.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.303
Holly, are you feeling better?

16:11.387 --> 16:13.180
I don't know.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.058
Well, I have a suggestion.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.394
Why did you lie to me
about the tickets?

16:18.477 --> 16:20.688
Why did you lie to me
about an old girlfriend?

16:20.771 --> 16:22.356
Do you know
how hurtful that was?

16:22.439 --> 16:25.234
Yes, I do. It doesn't
feel very good, does it?

16:25.317 --> 16:28.237
Oh! Oh, my God.

16:28.320 --> 16:30.447
Are you teaching me a lesson?

16:30.531 --> 16:33.409
Look, the next time
you want to hang out with Vince

16:33.492 --> 16:35.411
you don't have to make up
a girls' night out.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.870
Oh, my God, I didn't make it up.

16:36.954 --> 16:38.914
He said he could only bring
girls. I was really torn.

16:38.997 --> 16:42.793
I went anyway, but I felt really
guilty about it the whole time.

16:45.337 --> 16:47.131
You could've told me that.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.926
When you lie to me
it makes me think

16:51.009 --> 16:53.053
there's something going on.

16:58.016 --> 17:00.811
Is there something going on
with you and Vince?

17:04.189 --> 17:05.607
Henry, listen..

17:05.691 --> 17:07.943
(Gary)
Hey, what's up, y'all?

17:08.026 --> 17:09.819
Oh, Henry.

17:09.903 --> 17:12.364
Bro, I didn't even know
you were here.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.781
Well, what a surprise.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.451
I was just passing by
in the neighborhood--

17:15.534 --> 17:17.453
- I know you called Henry.
- I know you called Holly.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.788
Everyone knows everything.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.249
You all can't keep
a secret worth a damn.

17:23.916 --> 17:26.002
A brother
can't tell y'all nothing.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.846
[women laughing]

17:35.929 --> 17:38.557
Jeez, look at these women
throwing themselves

17:38.640 --> 17:41.769
at the bachelors
like a bunch of wild animals.

17:41.852 --> 17:45.522
Have they no dignity, or pride,
or self-res..

17:45.606 --> 17:47.691
Lauren? Lauren?

17:47.775 --> 17:50.527
Pardon me, I'm sorry,
excuse me. Move it!

17:52.321 --> 17:53.989
Hi.

17:54.072 --> 17:57.076
Hey, there you are. I've been
looking all over for you.

17:57.159 --> 17:58.118
Hi.

17:58.202 --> 18:00.996
Hey, uh, thanks
for that sweet note.

18:01.079 --> 18:03.665
Oh, um, about that,
I wanted to talk to you

18:03.749 --> 18:05.417
I did not write that note.
Lauren did.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.419
I know you wrote that note.

18:07.503 --> 18:08.670
Urgh.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.342
Can't you just admit
that you like me?

18:13.425 --> 18:17.429
Why do you keep fighting it
so much? Don't you get...tired?

18:17.513 --> 18:20.224
The idea that I could be
attracted to somebody like you

18:20.307 --> 18:22.184
is-is ridiculous.

18:22.267 --> 18:25.354
What, you want me to
introduce you to man-boobs?

18:26.522 --> 18:28.899
You know what,
you are egotistical

18:28.982 --> 18:31.151
you're shallow,
and you're kind of a slut.

18:32.778 --> 18:36.698
Okay. I do get hit on by women,
all the time.

18:36.782 --> 18:40.035
I get e-mails,
I get phone calls.

18:40.118 --> 18:43.080
Tonight,
I got panties thrown at me.

18:43.163 --> 18:44.498
Oh, my God.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.166
Yeah, pretty cool.

18:47.334 --> 18:50.671
But...that means nothing to me.

18:50.754 --> 18:54.883
What I want is to find
one special woman.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.845
I want the same thing
my parents had.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.221
And w-what is that?

18:59.304 --> 19:02.391
A great-looking kid, like me.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.725
Seriously, Val.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.395
My parents were
high school sweethearts.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.730
They've been married 37 years.

19:08.814 --> 19:12.359
And every day,
they look at each other like

19:12.442 --> 19:14.486
like it's the first day
they met.

19:15.988 --> 19:18.240
That's what I want.

19:19.491 --> 19:21.243
Oh.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.871
Hey, they gave me
a limo tonight.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.832
And there's a little
after-party at the Four Seasons.

19:26.915 --> 19:29.668
Uh, I kinda
came with, uh, Lauren.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.671
It's a good thing I'm a fireman

19:32.754 --> 19:33.922
because I don't know about you

19:34.006 --> 19:36.800
but I'm feeling
some serious heat.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.635
[chuckles]

19:38.719 --> 19:40.888
That is hysterical.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.518
Val?

19:46.602 --> 19:53.442
I'd really like you
to come with me.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.486
[instrumental music]

20:02.534 --> 20:03.619
Hey.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.788
- Wow, you look sexy.
- Oh, really?

20:06.872 --> 20:08.832
How do I know you're not lying?

20:08.916 --> 20:11.835
Come on, just look at you.
Look in the mirror.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.463
Yeah, I know.
A cute fireman hit on me.

20:14.546 --> 20:18.216
Oh. Did you two have sparks?

20:18.300 --> 20:21.094
See, that would've been cuter!

20:21.178 --> 20:24.056
- So, I told Henry the truth.
- You did?

20:24.139 --> 20:27.184
Yeah, well, he found out
and I confirmed it.

20:27.267 --> 20:29.436
Well, that's truth-ish.

20:29.519 --> 20:30.812
So, is everything
okay with you guys?

20:30.896 --> 20:32.147
Yeah, we had a really good talk

20:32.230 --> 20:33.315
and I think we got pretty much

20:33.398 --> 20:34.900
everything straightened out.

20:34.983 --> 20:37.152
- Good.
- Did you talk to Peter?

20:37.235 --> 20:40.656
Yes, I did, and actually,
he gave me a ride home.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.115
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

20:42.199 --> 20:45.535
Yeah. Me and uh,
half the women in Manhattan.

20:46.954 --> 20:50.165
- The pretty ones, anyway.
- Sorry.

20:50.249 --> 20:52.167
But he loved my third earring.

20:52.250 --> 20:56.129
No, yeah, well,
he is from your era.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.714
You know what, I'm starving,
is there any more of that

20:57.798 --> 20:59.049
chocolate chip cookie
dough ice cream?

20:59.132 --> 21:00.926
Oh, no, I finished it earlier.
Sorry.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.595
Mm. That's alright, I'm tired.
I'll see you in the morning.

21:03.679 --> 21:04.888
Goodnight.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.737
I heard the suction
from the lid, you liar!

21:20.821 --> 21:23.448
[indistinct shouting]

21:26.743 --> 21:29.037
[theme music]
