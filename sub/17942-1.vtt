00:58.321 --> 00:59.631
<i>Christmas is a time of
joy and celebration</i>

00:59.655 --> 01:03.202
<i>for everyone... but me.</i>

01:03.226 --> 01:04.468
<i>This Christmas isn't exactly
how I expected it would be.</i>

01:04.492 --> 01:07.772
<i>This Christmas isn't exactly
how I expected it would be.</i>

01:07.796 --> 01:10.408
<i>It all started last summer,</i>

01:10.432 --> 01:12.967
<i>when my cousin met my fiancé.</i>

01:21.944 --> 01:24.389
I couldn't agree more.

01:24.413 --> 01:26.613
Excuse me for a second. Thanks.

01:30.552 --> 01:32.865
Layla?

01:32.889 --> 01:33.832
Seth, hi!

01:33.856 --> 01:34.666
Hi!

01:34.690 --> 01:36.268
How are you?

01:36.292 --> 01:38.270
Better now that you're here.

01:38.294 --> 01:39.637
These investment crowds

01:39.661 --> 01:40.705
can be a little dull sometimes.

01:40.729 --> 01:41.740
Yeah.

01:41.764 --> 01:43.008
Where's Jack?

01:43.032 --> 01:44.442
He's off networking.

01:44.466 --> 01:46.311
He's hoping to
land a new client.

01:46.335 --> 01:47.946
Ah.

01:47.970 --> 01:48.981
We're engaged.

01:49.005 --> 01:50.682
I heard. Congratulations.

01:50.706 --> 01:51.583
Thank you.

01:51.607 --> 01:52.717
Have you set the date yet?

01:52.741 --> 01:55.320
Well, I've always wanted to
have a December wedding,

01:55.344 --> 01:57.122
but Jack thinks
it's a little soon.

01:57.146 --> 01:58.891
I think it would just make it

01:58.915 --> 02:00.155
that much more special, though.

02:01.017 --> 02:01.994
Jessica?

02:02.018 --> 02:02.961
Layla.

02:02.985 --> 02:05.397
Oh, my gosh...

02:05.421 --> 02:07.232
what are you doing here?

02:07.256 --> 02:10.335
I finally opened
my own boutique,

02:10.359 --> 02:12.271
and one of my
customers invited me.

02:12.295 --> 02:14.439
Apparently, this is
a huge money crowd,

02:14.463 --> 02:16.608
and I need financial backing.

02:16.632 --> 02:18.110
You should meet Jack.

02:18.134 --> 02:19.711
He's a financial advisor

02:19.735 --> 02:20.779
in small business.

02:20.803 --> 02:22.948
Maybe he could be a
big help to you.

02:22.972 --> 02:24.383
Did I hear my name?

02:24.407 --> 02:25.417
Jack...

02:25.441 --> 02:27.052
Hi. Meet Jessica.

02:27.076 --> 02:28.620
She's in need of some
financial advice,

02:28.644 --> 02:30.923
and your expertise would
be a perfect fit for her.

02:30.947 --> 02:33.125
Well, let me give you my card.

02:33.149 --> 02:35.994
I would be more
than happy to help.

02:36.018 --> 02:37.695
Thanks.

02:37.719 --> 02:38.663
That's great.

02:38.687 --> 02:39.831
This was the exciting news

02:39.855 --> 02:41.066
I wanted to tell you.

02:41.090 --> 02:42.034
I'm engaged.

02:42.058 --> 02:43.302
We're engaged.

02:43.326 --> 02:44.303
This is my fiancé, Jack.

02:44.327 --> 02:45.603
Oh.

02:45.627 --> 02:46.939
Wow.

02:46.963 --> 02:48.640
Congratulations.

02:48.664 --> 02:51.410
Thank you.

02:51.434 --> 02:53.145
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:53.169 --> 02:56.581
So, um, I guess I should
introduce you guys.

02:56.605 --> 02:57.582
This is my cousin...

02:57.606 --> 02:58.550
Really?

02:58.574 --> 02:59.551
Jessica.

02:59.575 --> 03:00.718
I thought I'd met
all your family.

03:00.742 --> 03:02.354
Oh, well, I've been
living in New York

03:02.378 --> 03:03.355
for a few years,

03:03.379 --> 03:05.657
and then a short stint
in Paris after that.

03:05.681 --> 03:08.493
Just moved back a
couple of weeks ago.

03:08.517 --> 03:09.527
I just opened my own boutique.

03:09.551 --> 03:11.096
Paris? That's my favorite
city in the world.

03:11.120 --> 03:12.630
Mine too.

03:12.654 --> 03:13.932
Why don't you two have a drink,

03:13.956 --> 03:15.700
let Jack give you
some free advice?

03:15.724 --> 03:16.801
He really knows his stuff.

03:16.825 --> 03:18.536
Sounds like a plan.

03:18.560 --> 03:19.972
Okay.

03:19.996 --> 03:21.206
I'll be right back.

03:21.230 --> 03:22.640
You couldn't be in better hands.

03:29.205 --> 03:31.938
What did you just do?

03:34.643 --> 03:37.555
Aunt Lorraine, you know how
much I love Christmas,

03:37.579 --> 03:39.257
and how I wanted to
be a December bride

03:39.281 --> 03:42.694
ever since I was...

03:42.718 --> 03:44.896
I know, hon'.

03:44.920 --> 03:46.564
I just never imagined
that I'd be going

03:46.588 --> 03:48.467
to my cousin and
ex-fiancé's wedding.

03:48.491 --> 03:51.436
What little girl
dreams about that?

03:51.460 --> 03:52.670
I don't even know
why I was invited.

03:52.694 --> 03:54.539
I understand.

03:54.563 --> 03:57.142
Well, then you understand

03:57.166 --> 03:58.043
why I can't go.

03:58.067 --> 04:00.045
Sweetheart,

04:00.069 --> 04:01.880
all we have in life is family.

04:01.904 --> 04:04.182
Look,

04:04.206 --> 04:06.284
it's you I'm thinking about.

04:06.308 --> 04:08.353
If you go to that wedding,

04:08.377 --> 04:11.356
it'll give you a
chance to move on.

04:11.380 --> 04:13.925
You've always been
like a mom to me.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.394
I'm so grateful for you.

04:15.418 --> 04:17.629
I love you so much,

04:17.653 --> 04:20.298
and I don't want this
to come between us.

04:20.322 --> 04:21.699
I love you too.

04:21.723 --> 04:23.257
And it won't, I promise.

04:24.427 --> 04:26.104
That's all I'm asking.

04:26.128 --> 04:27.272
Well, and...

04:27.296 --> 04:28.496
come to your cousin's wedding.

04:29.331 --> 04:31.176
I'll think about going
to the wedding.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.633
I'm here for you.

04:59.728 --> 05:00.972
Oh, hey, Cooper!

05:00.996 --> 05:03.341
I am so glad to see you.

05:03.365 --> 05:05.110
I have a really big
favor to ask you.

05:05.134 --> 05:06.178
Okay.

05:06.202 --> 05:07.712
My ex-fiancé is
marrying my cousin,

05:07.736 --> 05:09.114
and because I'm family,

05:09.138 --> 05:10.449
I am expected to
go to the wedding.

05:10.473 --> 05:11.783
Ouch.

05:11.807 --> 05:12.917
Will you go with me?

05:12.941 --> 05:15.454
I have sworn off love, and
I'm not dating anybody,

05:15.478 --> 05:17.355
and I just can't bear the
idea of going alone.

05:17.379 --> 05:18.290
When is it?

05:18.314 --> 05:19.591
Saturday?

05:19.615 --> 05:20.858
You got yourself a date.

05:20.882 --> 05:21.926
Thank you!

05:21.950 --> 05:23.528
Oh, you are the best.

05:23.552 --> 05:25.497
You just saved my life.

05:25.521 --> 05:26.931
And my pride,

05:26.955 --> 05:29.289
or whatever's left of it.

05:44.373 --> 05:45.984
Sorry I'm late.

05:46.008 --> 05:48.253
Some personal stuff
I've been dealing with.

05:48.277 --> 05:49.787
Leave your problems at the door.

05:49.811 --> 05:52.224
No client wants to
hear your tale of woe.

05:52.248 --> 05:53.858
And your boss is so overworked,

05:53.882 --> 05:55.360
I cannot find the words.

05:55.384 --> 05:57.996
Right, sorry.

05:58.020 --> 05:59.397
Got it.

05:59.421 --> 06:00.865
Did you invoice for
the Montgomery job?

06:00.889 --> 06:01.899
Yes,

06:01.923 --> 06:03.168
and I'm waiting for
them to return my call.

06:03.192 --> 06:05.937
And did you send back
those mismatched sconces?

06:05.961 --> 06:08.039
The return receipt
is on my desk.

06:08.063 --> 06:09.307
Good.

06:09.331 --> 06:11.976
I'm doing the Fletcher house
for the Holiday Tour of Homes,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.046
so start cataloguing Christmas
issues of magazines,

06:15.070 --> 06:17.549
and avoid the traditional
red and green.

06:17.573 --> 06:19.384
I want crisp, clean,

06:19.408 --> 06:20.985
silver and gold.

06:21.009 --> 06:23.555
Well, isn't traditional
the point?

06:23.579 --> 06:25.757
Things that remind people of
happy Christmas memories?

06:25.781 --> 06:27.421
Well, not if you want
to make a statement.

06:29.585 --> 06:30.895
You disagree?

06:30.919 --> 06:32.597
I mean...

06:32.621 --> 06:34.132
it's your name on the door,

06:34.156 --> 06:35.967
what do I know?

06:35.991 --> 06:39.504
An interior decorator
needs a unique style.

06:39.528 --> 06:42.574
My work always says
"Darcy Sterling."

06:42.598 --> 06:44.242
You have a good eye,

06:44.266 --> 06:45.566
it's just not enough.

06:47.469 --> 06:50.170
Thank you.

06:53.209 --> 06:54.209
No...

06:56.245 --> 06:58.490
<i>I don't get it, sis.</i>

06:58.514 --> 07:01.293
<i>I thought this is
what you wanted.</i>

07:01.317 --> 07:02.760
No, I don't want to
be Darcy's assistant

07:02.784 --> 07:03.995
for the rest of my life.

07:04.019 --> 07:04.896
What I want

07:04.920 --> 07:07.265
is to start a
business of my own.

07:07.289 --> 07:08.933
So, what's stopping you?

07:08.957 --> 07:10.535
I mean,

07:10.559 --> 07:12.270
isn't it time for you to
start living your own dreams

07:12.294 --> 07:13.338
for once?

07:13.362 --> 07:14.673
Believe me, Beckett,

07:14.697 --> 07:16.474
it would be way easier

07:16.498 --> 07:18.042
to walk into Stanley
Malcolm's office

07:18.066 --> 07:19.444
and demand that he hire me

07:19.468 --> 07:21.179
than to attend Jack and
Jessica's wedding.

07:21.203 --> 07:22.480
Just do it.

07:22.504 --> 07:23.748
Walk right up to
him and say, "Hi,

07:23.772 --> 07:25.016
I'm a great designer."

07:25.040 --> 07:26.818
Show him your book.

07:26.842 --> 07:28.653
Don't you think
that's a little bold?

07:28.677 --> 07:29.721
Yeah, it is bold,

07:29.745 --> 07:32.090
but you're bold, so... be bold.

07:32.114 --> 07:33.658
I don't know,

07:33.682 --> 07:34.626
I can't even think about work.

07:34.650 --> 07:36.328
All I can think about
is their wedding.

07:36.352 --> 07:37.795
Yeah.

07:37.819 --> 07:39.063
Speaking of that,

07:39.087 --> 07:41.799
are you sure you don't want
this guy as your date?

07:41.823 --> 07:43.067
Thank you for the offer,

07:43.091 --> 07:45.103
but there's nothing
more embarrassing

07:45.127 --> 07:46.971
than going to your
ex-fiancé's wedding

07:46.995 --> 07:48.395
than going with your brother.

07:49.732 --> 07:50.808
Besides, I have a date.

07:50.832 --> 07:51.776
Who?

07:51.800 --> 07:53.712
Cooper. My neighbor.

07:53.736 --> 07:54.512
Cooper.

07:54.536 --> 07:55.347
Yeah.

07:55.371 --> 07:57.315
Nice. Good choice.

07:57.339 --> 08:00.017
Well, now that your
date crisis is settled,

08:00.041 --> 08:04.578
I guess you can focus on
finding a new job, huh?

08:14.222 --> 08:16.301
Okay, so keep the grays,

08:16.325 --> 08:18.570
and then punctuate it
with subtle blues.

08:18.594 --> 08:21.873
I want lots of textured
leather and chrome.

08:21.897 --> 08:24.798
Substantial but not dated.

08:26.602 --> 08:27.602
What about the windows?

08:29.237 --> 08:32.484
You can't just
summon inspiration.

08:32.508 --> 08:34.251
I have to get to my lunch,

08:34.275 --> 08:36.154
so I need you to measure

08:36.178 --> 08:38.690
all of the offices individually,

08:38.714 --> 08:40.024
and then pick up the lamp

08:40.048 --> 08:41.058
for the Fletcher
house that I'm doing

08:41.082 --> 08:42.982
for the Holiday Tour of Homes.

08:49.525 --> 08:51.135
- Oh!
- I'm sorry!

08:51.159 --> 08:52.003
Layla!

08:52.027 --> 08:53.638
What a nice surprise
running into you.

08:53.662 --> 08:54.773
Literally.

08:54.797 --> 08:56.841
I didn't realize
you worked here.

08:56.865 --> 08:57.842
Uh, yeah.

08:57.866 --> 09:00.111
I don't need your help.

09:00.135 --> 09:02.836
You've done quite
enough already.

09:04.707 --> 09:08.219
Um, hey, I'm sorry to hear
about Jack and Jessica.

09:08.243 --> 09:09.954
Not as sorry as I am.

09:09.978 --> 09:10.922
When I put them together,

09:10.946 --> 09:12.912
I had no idea where
it would lead.

09:14.316 --> 09:15.316
Obviously.

09:17.018 --> 09:18.963
Do you know where Mr.
Hardwick's office is?

09:18.987 --> 09:20.799
Yeah.

09:20.823 --> 09:22.534
Just down the hall.

09:22.558 --> 09:23.724
Thanks.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.472
Layla, uh, listen,

09:27.496 --> 09:29.240
since we're both going
to the wedding,

09:29.264 --> 09:30.842
maybe...

09:30.866 --> 09:33.166
I don't know, maybe you
and I could go together.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.413
You can't be serious.

09:36.705 --> 09:38.115
I will take that as a no.

09:38.139 --> 09:40.151
Well, I already have a date.

09:40.175 --> 09:41.486
You have a boyfriend.

09:41.510 --> 09:42.554
Why,

09:42.578 --> 09:44.155
you want to introduce
him to another girl?

09:44.179 --> 09:46.090
Look, uh...

09:46.114 --> 09:49.293
I don't want things to
be awkward between us.

09:49.317 --> 09:51.730
We're way past awkward.

09:51.754 --> 09:53.365
But why don't we just

09:53.389 --> 09:55.299
go our separate ways

09:55.323 --> 09:56.768
and leave it at that?

09:58.260 --> 09:59.493
I got that for you.

10:00.696 --> 10:01.806
Okay?

10:01.830 --> 10:02.830
Yeah.

10:03.465 --> 10:04.409
But since he's owned it,

10:04.433 --> 10:05.977
he hasn't really done
anything to it, right?

10:06.001 --> 10:07.445
So I think he should really...

10:07.469 --> 10:08.680
No, I think he should really
do something with the house.

10:08.704 --> 10:09.848
It's his house...

10:09.872 --> 10:11.215
Seth, Seth!

10:11.239 --> 10:12.350
You know my wife.

10:12.374 --> 10:13.651
Of course.

10:13.675 --> 10:15.720
Very nice to see you again, Mrs.
Hardwick.

10:15.744 --> 10:16.755
Seth...

10:16.779 --> 10:17.889
She'd like to have
a word with you.

10:17.913 --> 10:18.956
Are you familiar with

10:18.980 --> 10:21.325
the Holiday Tour of
Homes charity event?

10:21.349 --> 10:22.594
Uh, yes, of course,

10:22.618 --> 10:24.562
but I've never actually
taken the Tour.

10:24.586 --> 10:25.697
Well, visitors get to see

10:25.721 --> 10:26.931
all the holiday decorations

10:26.955 --> 10:29.501
in some of our community's
loveliest homes,

10:29.525 --> 10:31.669
and the donations go to our
school education fund.

10:31.693 --> 10:33.638
I'm chairing the
committee this year,

10:33.662 --> 10:35.440
and we'd like you
to participate.

10:35.464 --> 10:36.974
I wish that I could.

10:36.998 --> 10:38.410
Unfortunately, your
husband keeps me so busy,

10:38.434 --> 10:39.511
I just wouldn't have
time to decorate.

10:39.535 --> 10:40.912
You can hire someone.

10:40.936 --> 10:42.380
You may as well say yes.

10:42.404 --> 10:44.370
Joyce always gets her way.

10:45.941 --> 10:48.085
Then consider me signed up.

10:48.109 --> 10:48.920
Great.

10:48.944 --> 10:50.955
"Happy wife, happy life."

10:50.979 --> 10:52.446
- Oh, stop.
- Yes, sir.

10:53.549 --> 10:56.193
Okay, the Tour is
in three weeks.

10:56.217 --> 10:57.796
There are no
particular guidelines,

10:57.820 --> 11:00.732
just make sure the house looks...
Christmassy.

11:00.756 --> 11:02.322
You know?

11:04.893 --> 11:06.092
Christmassy.

11:12.601 --> 11:13.601
Hello?

11:15.838 --> 11:17.482
I'm so sorry, Layla.

11:17.506 --> 11:18.750
They sent me home from work.

11:18.774 --> 11:20.284
Cooper, are you okay?

11:20.308 --> 11:21.586
You sound awful.

11:21.610 --> 11:23.688
<i>I am sick as a dog.</i>

11:23.712 --> 11:25.345
Oh, no, I'm so sorry.

11:27.115 --> 11:29.260
Wait, does this mean...

11:29.284 --> 11:31.529
you're not going to be able
to make it to the wedding?

11:31.553 --> 11:33.998
<i>Isn't there someone
else you could take?</i>

11:34.022 --> 11:35.800
No, I mean, you
were my last hope

11:35.824 --> 11:37.836
of going with a date
other than my brother.

11:37.860 --> 11:39.938
<i>Now I'm going to have
nobody to hide behind.</i>

11:39.962 --> 11:41.673
I'm really sorry, Layla,

11:41.697 --> 11:42.674
I am.

11:42.698 --> 11:44.241
No, don't be.

11:44.265 --> 11:45.309
I will figure something out.

11:45.333 --> 11:46.945
Feel better and get some rest.

11:46.969 --> 11:47.969
Bye.

12:06.622 --> 12:07.665
Oh, hey.

12:07.689 --> 12:09.455
I don't mean to interrupt.
I can come back.

12:10.458 --> 12:11.569
I just have to take
some measurements

12:11.593 --> 12:12.626
of your office.

12:13.762 --> 12:15.161
Uh, go ahead.

12:22.804 --> 12:25.049
No artwork, no
personal touches...

12:25.073 --> 12:26.640
No distractions.

12:29.711 --> 12:31.377
You look upset.

12:33.214 --> 12:35.448
I mean, more upset than before.

12:38.687 --> 12:40.119
What's the matter?

12:41.657 --> 12:44.268
I no longer have a date.

12:44.292 --> 12:46.037
What happened to your boyfriend?

12:46.061 --> 12:47.204
He's not my boyfriend,
he's my neighbor,

12:47.228 --> 12:49.140
and he has the flu.

12:49.164 --> 12:50.141
Neighbor.

12:50.165 --> 12:51.275
Yeah, my neighbor.

12:51.299 --> 12:53.099
Well...

12:54.202 --> 12:55.947
there's always me.

12:55.971 --> 12:58.049
Are you saying your
offer still stands?

12:58.073 --> 13:00.384
Yeah, my offer still stands.

13:00.408 --> 13:01.686
Why?

13:01.710 --> 13:02.654
Are you reconsidering?

13:02.678 --> 13:03.621
Maybe.

13:03.645 --> 13:04.778
Maybe?

13:06.048 --> 13:07.547
I'll text you my address.

13:08.984 --> 13:10.461
Layla...

13:10.485 --> 13:11.563
So it's a date.

13:11.587 --> 13:13.197
No, it's not a date.

13:13.221 --> 13:16.500
I mean, you're my date,
but it's not a date.

13:16.524 --> 13:17.991
It's not a date.

13:21.563 --> 13:24.341
Okay, I can't decide
what to wear.

13:24.365 --> 13:28.446
Which one doesn't scream
"Poor unfortunate Layla"?

13:28.470 --> 13:29.480
Mmm...

13:29.504 --> 13:32.850
That one screams, "What
was Jack thinking?"

13:32.874 --> 13:36.287
Perfect, we love that.

13:36.311 --> 13:37.689
Now, last time I'm
gonna ask, I promise,

13:37.713 --> 13:39.390
but are you sure you don't
want me to take you?

13:39.414 --> 13:40.625
I know I'm not Cooper,

13:40.649 --> 13:42.927
I know it's not the same as
having a "date" date, but...

13:42.951 --> 13:44.596
I actually do have a date.

13:44.620 --> 13:45.597
I'm going with Seth.

13:45.621 --> 13:47.699
Seth Murphy?

13:47.723 --> 13:50.367
The guy who introduced
Jack and Jessica?

13:50.391 --> 13:51.335
Look, I really don't have time

13:51.359 --> 13:52.136
to go over details.

13:52.160 --> 13:53.638
I'm really late.

13:53.662 --> 13:55.640
I'll see you soon.

13:55.664 --> 13:57.642
Okay.

13:57.666 --> 13:59.043
Layla O'Reilly,

13:59.067 --> 14:00.244
you never cease to surprise me.

14:00.268 --> 14:02.736
And I do mean surprise.

14:09.377 --> 14:11.111
Layla...

14:12.413 --> 14:13.413
You okay?

14:14.415 --> 14:15.359
Mm-hm.

14:15.383 --> 14:17.383
You look stunning.

14:18.954 --> 14:21.265
I just want to get
this over with.

14:21.289 --> 14:22.967
You don't have to flatter me.

14:22.991 --> 14:24.035
Well, for the record,

14:24.059 --> 14:26.126
I never thought Jack was
good enough for you.

14:27.562 --> 14:29.974
Stop trying to make
me feel better.

14:29.998 --> 14:30.998
One thing...

14:32.200 --> 14:33.911
I don't like your shoes.

14:33.935 --> 14:35.046
At all.

14:35.070 --> 14:36.190
What? What's wrong with my...

14:38.573 --> 14:40.018
Stop.

14:40.042 --> 14:42.275
We're going to be late.

14:45.180 --> 14:48.492
I, Jessica, take you, Jack,

14:48.516 --> 14:51.696
to be my husband,

14:51.720 --> 14:54.132
to have and to hold,

14:54.156 --> 14:55.933
from this day forward,

14:55.957 --> 14:58.502
for as long as we
both shall live.

14:58.526 --> 15:01.939
I, Jack, take thee, Jessica,

15:01.963 --> 15:03.041
to be my wife.

15:03.065 --> 15:04.075
To have and to hold,

15:04.099 --> 15:06.577
from this day forward,

15:06.601 --> 15:10.081
for as long as we
both shall live.

15:10.105 --> 15:11.382
If anybody can show just cause

15:11.406 --> 15:13.017
why these two cannot
be joined together,

15:13.041 --> 15:13.985
speak now,

15:14.009 --> 15:17.276
or forever hold your peace.

15:22.184 --> 15:24.028
I pronounce you

15:24.052 --> 15:25.997
husband and wife.

15:26.021 --> 15:28.955
You may kiss the bride.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.418
I am very proud of you.

15:47.442 --> 15:48.775
Thank you.

15:50.112 --> 15:51.544
Is this your date?

15:52.680 --> 15:54.358
Uh, yes.

15:54.382 --> 15:55.581
He is, yeah.

15:56.584 --> 15:57.617
Well done.

16:03.125 --> 16:04.035
Thank you for coming.

16:04.059 --> 16:06.871
You okay?

16:06.895 --> 16:10.374
I'd be better if you'd
stop asking me that.

16:11.366 --> 16:12.376
Hey.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.400
Thank you.

16:16.037 --> 16:17.381
It was a lovely ceremony.

16:17.405 --> 16:20.084
Thank you.

16:20.108 --> 16:20.885
Congratulations.

16:20.909 --> 16:22.153
Thanks, buddy.

16:22.177 --> 16:24.377
Are you guys together?

16:26.414 --> 16:27.491
Mm-hm.

16:27.515 --> 16:28.860
Yes!

16:28.884 --> 16:30.661
As a matter of fact, we are.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.029
Uh...

16:32.053 --> 16:33.664
we will see you
at the reception.

16:33.688 --> 16:34.966
Congratulations again.

16:34.990 --> 16:36.289
Thank you.

16:49.637 --> 16:51.117
What's up? You don't
like the chicken?

16:53.041 --> 16:54.351
I-I...

16:54.375 --> 16:56.609
I'm just not that hungry.

16:58.413 --> 17:00.591
I think I need to
go get some air.

17:00.615 --> 17:02.448
No, come on, dance
with your dad.

17:04.219 --> 17:06.396
Come on.

17:11.059 --> 17:13.470
You know, I think I
do need some air.

17:13.493 --> 17:15.071
Okay, honey.

17:22.237 --> 17:23.636
Club soda, please.

17:25.840 --> 17:27.417
Mr. Malcolm?

17:27.442 --> 17:29.320
Layla O'Reilly.

17:29.344 --> 17:30.922
Are you a buyer or a seller?

17:30.946 --> 17:33.124
I actually stage homes,

17:33.148 --> 17:35.293
and I was hoping that you would
take a look at my portfolio.

17:35.317 --> 17:38.462
I work with some very
experienced decorators.

17:38.486 --> 17:40.965
Well, maybe one of your
smaller properties.

17:40.989 --> 17:42.755
I don't have any
small properties.

17:44.059 --> 17:45.036
There you are.

17:45.060 --> 17:45.837
Seth.

17:45.861 --> 17:46.838
Stanley!

17:46.862 --> 17:47.805
What a pleasant surprise.

17:47.829 --> 17:49.673
Are you friends with the
bride or the groom?

17:49.697 --> 17:50.708
The groom. And you?

17:50.732 --> 17:52.676
Well, I play golf with
the groom's father.

17:52.700 --> 17:53.945
Well...

17:53.969 --> 17:54.979
You know Mr. Malcolm?

17:55.003 --> 17:55.947
"Stanley," please.

17:55.971 --> 17:56.981
I sold Seth his house,

17:57.005 --> 17:58.015
and he was kind enough

17:58.039 --> 17:59.583
to send some of his
clients my way.

17:59.607 --> 18:00.451
That's right.

18:00.475 --> 18:02.019
Well, I was just telling Stanley

18:02.043 --> 18:03.554
that I stage homes.

18:03.578 --> 18:04.856
That's right.

18:04.880 --> 18:07.091
From artwork to furniture,

18:07.115 --> 18:09.382
to anything a house needs
to really make the sale.

18:10.385 --> 18:11.996
Oh, yes.

18:12.020 --> 18:13.697
And let me tell you,
she's very talented.

18:13.721 --> 18:16.033
One of the best
stagers I've seen.

18:16.057 --> 18:18.069
Really impeccable
taste, flawless.

18:18.093 --> 18:21.038
Wow, that is quite
an endorsement.

18:21.062 --> 18:23.107
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:23.131 --> 18:24.308
I promised my wife a dance.

18:24.332 --> 18:25.631
Have fun.

18:27.869 --> 18:30.181
You know, that's not a bad idea.

18:30.205 --> 18:31.382
Do you want to dance?

18:31.406 --> 18:34.307
Come on.

18:38.346 --> 18:40.758
Hey...

18:40.782 --> 18:42.927
Aren't we meant to look
like we're a couple?

18:42.951 --> 18:46.063
Pretend I said something
really funny.

18:49.424 --> 18:51.035
I think you can do
better than that.

19:01.569 --> 19:04.215
Don't tell me you're
actually having fun.

19:05.573 --> 19:07.385
Maybe...

19:07.409 --> 19:09.320
Maybe a little bit of fun.

19:09.344 --> 19:10.410
Good.

19:13.248 --> 19:14.591
You know, I'm a terrible dancer.

19:14.615 --> 19:15.960
I don't know if you
knew that about me,

19:15.984 --> 19:17.395
but I'm really bad.

19:17.419 --> 19:18.362
Two left feet.

19:18.386 --> 19:19.386
That's right.

19:20.755 --> 19:23.968
I could've watched you
two dance all night.

19:23.992 --> 19:25.069
Thank you.

19:25.093 --> 19:26.437
It's all about finding
the right partner.

19:26.461 --> 19:28.973
Oh, my sentiments exactly, sir.

19:28.997 --> 19:30.241
Seth!

19:30.265 --> 19:31.875
You two really are a couple?

19:31.899 --> 19:32.977
Yes...

19:33.001 --> 19:34.011
Looks that way.

19:34.035 --> 19:34.979
And we couldn't be happier.

19:35.003 --> 19:36.747
I'm just a little surprised.

19:36.771 --> 19:37.982
You never even mentioned

19:38.006 --> 19:39.238
you guys were dating.

19:40.275 --> 19:41.986
Right, uh, well,

19:42.010 --> 19:43.988
it just happened so fast.

19:44.012 --> 19:45.289
Thing is,

19:45.313 --> 19:46.390
I walked into work one day,

19:46.414 --> 19:47.391
and there she was,

19:47.415 --> 19:48.993
taking measurements
to redo my office,

19:49.017 --> 19:51.996
and, well,

19:52.020 --> 19:54.932
it just felt so right,

19:54.956 --> 19:56.400
and we started hanging out,

19:56.424 --> 19:59.003
and we've been
together ever since.

19:59.027 --> 20:00.938
It sounds... pretty serious.

20:00.962 --> 20:03.229
Oh, it's as serious as it gets.

20:04.532 --> 20:05.776
We are engaged.

20:07.302 --> 20:08.379
Oh, that's wonderful!

20:08.403 --> 20:09.447
That's wonderful news!

20:09.471 --> 20:11.315
How exciting!

20:11.339 --> 20:12.683
Why didn't you say anything?

20:12.707 --> 20:13.784
I'm sorry, we didn't want
to steal your thunder

20:13.808 --> 20:14.751
for your big day.

20:14.775 --> 20:16.653
<i>And it's time to cut the cake.</i>

20:16.677 --> 20:18.111
Oh, that's our cue.

20:20.848 --> 20:22.382
Can I talk to you for a second?

20:24.986 --> 20:25.863
What have you done?

20:25.887 --> 20:27.298
I may have taken things
a little too far.

20:27.322 --> 20:28.399
Yeah, you think?

20:28.423 --> 20:29.600
But...

20:29.624 --> 20:31.135
all those sympathetic looks
you were getting before

20:31.159 --> 20:32.103
have turned into smiles.

20:32.127 --> 20:33.404
Imagine the looks
we're going to get

20:33.428 --> 20:35.039
when they realize we're
not telling the truth.

20:35.063 --> 20:36.073
I think that

20:36.097 --> 20:37.608
you are going to laugh
about this one day.

20:37.632 --> 20:38.909
Not in a million years.

20:38.933 --> 20:42.779
Jessica and I would like to
thank you all for coming

20:42.803 --> 20:46.317
and for sharing our joy.

20:46.341 --> 20:49.853
And we'd like to
extend our best wishes

20:49.877 --> 20:51.389
to Layla and Seth,

20:51.413 --> 20:53.757
who just announced...

20:53.781 --> 20:56.793
their engagement.

21:05.293 --> 21:08.194
Congratulations, you two!

21:12.263 --> 21:14.596
You just made an
embarrassing situation

21:14.731 --> 21:16.865
so much worse.

21:22.139 --> 21:23.205
Oh, what I wouldn't give

21:23.340 --> 21:24.572
to be "Poor Layla,"

21:24.708 --> 21:27.242
not "Engaged Layla
Who Actually Isn't."

21:27.378 --> 21:28.977
Wait, so, what are you saying,

21:29.113 --> 21:30.113
the wedding is off?

21:31.982 --> 21:35.284
I'm going to need you to
take this seriously, okay?

21:35.419 --> 21:36.852
How do we deal with this?

21:36.987 --> 21:38.887
What do I tell my
dad and my brother,

21:39.023 --> 21:40.956
and my entire family?

21:42.793 --> 21:44.893
I'll tell them I
did it on a dare.

21:45.029 --> 21:47.196
The party was so much
fun, I got wedding fever.

21:47.331 --> 21:49.376
Of course, 'cause you can't
tell them the real reason

21:49.400 --> 21:50.966
is because you
feel sorry for me.

21:51.101 --> 21:53.869
That's not the wording I'd use.

21:54.004 --> 21:55.938
Close enough.

21:57.074 --> 21:58.506
Look...

22:00.010 --> 22:01.176
I'm sorry, Layla,

22:01.312 --> 22:04.079
I really am.

22:04.214 --> 22:05.734
I'll call everyone
first thing tomorrow

22:05.816 --> 22:07.096
and tell them it was a bad joke.

22:07.217 --> 22:09.151
Too much champagne,

22:09.286 --> 22:12.154
and poor judgment on my part.

22:14.024 --> 22:14.890
Hey.

22:15.025 --> 22:16.458
I'll make it right, I promise.

22:16.593 --> 22:18.593
Thank you.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.428
Okay.

22:32.242 --> 22:34.476
<i>Hi, darling, it's Aunt Lorraine.</i>

22:34.611 --> 22:35.744
<i>I hope your happy news</i>

22:35.879 --> 22:40.048
<i>means that you and Jessica
can bury the hatchet.</i>

22:40.184 --> 22:41.683
<i>Hi, it's your brother.</i>

22:41.818 --> 22:44.887
<i>You've taken keeping secrets
to a whole new level.</i>

22:45.022 --> 22:47.856
<i>Call me.</i>

22:47.992 --> 22:50.759
<i>Layla, this is Stanley Malcolm.</i>

22:50.894 --> 22:52.294
<i>I was hoping we
could have lunch.</i>

22:52.429 --> 22:54.429
<i>We can discuss your
staging some houses.</i>

22:54.564 --> 22:55.430
<i>Bring your portfolio,</i>

22:55.565 --> 22:57.565
<i>and bring your fiancé.</i>

23:01.771 --> 23:04.439
<i>This is Seth Murphy of
Denning and Hardwick.</i>

23:04.574 --> 23:06.808
<i>Sorry I missed your call.
Please leave a message.</i>

23:08.078 --> 23:10.645
Hey, Seth, it's me.

23:10.780 --> 23:13.248
Don't tell anyone
we're not engaged...

23:13.384 --> 23:15.850
just yet.

23:15.986 --> 23:17.452
Call me.

23:21.358 --> 23:22.857
I could barely sleep last night.

23:22.993 --> 23:24.826
This isn't grand larceny.

23:24.961 --> 23:26.028
It's just...

23:26.163 --> 23:27.243
it's lunch and a white lie.

23:27.297 --> 23:28.530
Working for Malcolm Realty

23:28.665 --> 23:30.365
could launch my entire business.

23:30.501 --> 23:32.467
Then let's go to the lunch.

23:32.602 --> 23:33.602
I got you into this mess.

23:33.737 --> 23:35.404
This can be my way
of redeeming myself.

23:36.806 --> 23:38.451
So we'd only be engaged
for a couple more days.

23:38.475 --> 23:39.808
A couple of days.

23:39.943 --> 23:40.943
Until I got the job.

23:41.078 --> 23:42.244
Right.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.046
But I'm going to need
something from you.

23:45.015 --> 23:46.015
Besides redemption?

23:46.116 --> 23:47.416
Consider this a win-win.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.584
I need you to decorate my house

23:49.719 --> 23:51.119
for the Holiday Tour of Homes.

23:52.356 --> 23:53.756
You don't even know
if I'm any good.

23:53.790 --> 23:54.656
No, but I know you,

23:54.791 --> 23:56.036
I know how hard
you're going to try.

23:56.060 --> 23:56.891
Besides,

23:57.027 --> 23:59.394
this could be great exposure.

23:59.530 --> 24:00.706
It might even drum up
some more business

24:00.730 --> 24:02.064
other than Malcolm Realty.

24:02.199 --> 24:03.599
You've just got to
make it really...

24:03.733 --> 24:05.300
"Christmassy".

24:06.670 --> 24:07.670
Okay.

24:07.771 --> 24:08.570
Okay?

24:08.705 --> 24:09.537
You've got a deal.

24:09.673 --> 24:10.673
Deal.

24:16.213 --> 24:17.545
Now, Seth is a
shrewd negotiator.

24:17.681 --> 24:19.201
He got his house at
a remarkable price.

24:19.283 --> 24:20.283
It's lovely, isn't it?

24:20.350 --> 24:23.151
Oh, yeah, it's... it's gorgeous.

24:23.287 --> 24:24.287
Beautiful home.

24:24.421 --> 24:26.254
And Layla is an amazing stager.

24:26.390 --> 24:27.189
Can we show him, honey?

24:27.324 --> 24:28.523
Mm-hm.

24:31.562 --> 24:32.427
Very nice.

24:32.563 --> 24:34.662
You really are very good.

24:34.798 --> 24:36.431
Thanks.

24:36.567 --> 24:38.733
Honey.

24:38.868 --> 24:40.068
Layla is doing my house

24:40.204 --> 24:41.347
for the Holiday Tour of Homes.

24:41.371 --> 24:42.537
Oh.

24:42.672 --> 24:43.338
Well, I'm glad
you're doing that.

24:43.474 --> 24:44.714
That house deserves to be seen,

24:44.841 --> 24:46.119
and you know how
Joyce Hardwick feels

24:46.143 --> 24:46.975
about the tour,

24:47.111 --> 24:48.111
and her charity.

24:48.245 --> 24:48.977
I do.

24:49.113 --> 24:51.313
Can I get the bill, please?

24:51.448 --> 24:53.048
I could do one of your
current properties

24:53.150 --> 24:54.150
on spec.

24:54.184 --> 24:57.085
I would love the opportunity
to work with you.

24:57.221 --> 24:59.621
You know, I think I'd rather see

24:59.756 --> 25:01.490
what you do with Seth's house.

25:02.792 --> 25:06.228
But that's three weeks away.

25:06.363 --> 25:07.862
Houses like Seth's

25:07.998 --> 25:09.109
are the pillars of my business,

25:09.133 --> 25:11.466
and I know he has done
absolutely nothing with it.

25:11.602 --> 25:14.036
If you could transform
that house,

25:14.171 --> 25:15.970
you just might get my attention.

25:17.241 --> 25:19.908
I love a challenge.

25:20.043 --> 25:21.876
Good. Sorry I have to run.

25:22.012 --> 25:23.289
I have a showing this afternoon.

25:23.313 --> 25:24.346
One of your clients.

25:24.481 --> 25:25.880
Thank you, Stanley.

25:26.016 --> 25:27.582
Good luck.

25:32.689 --> 25:34.089
Now what do we do?

25:34.224 --> 25:35.857
We stay engaged
another three weeks.

25:35.992 --> 25:36.992
You get a job...

25:37.027 --> 25:38.027
Maybe I get a job.

25:38.094 --> 25:39.261
And I get my house done,

25:39.396 --> 25:41.096
and get to impress
my boss's wife.

25:41.231 --> 25:42.897
What do we tell our
family and friends?

25:43.033 --> 25:43.865
See, that part could be tricky,

25:44.000 --> 25:45.240
but I think we can pull it off.

25:45.302 --> 25:46.568
Plus...

25:46.703 --> 25:49.604
your Aunt Lorraine loves me.

25:53.377 --> 25:54.842
Wow, your yard is so...

25:54.978 --> 25:56.878
empty.

25:58.014 --> 25:59.559
We're going to need
something really special.

25:59.583 --> 26:01.049
Like what?

26:01.185 --> 26:02.884
I don't know.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.853
Wait, no, no, no, wait, wait.

26:05.989 --> 26:07.255
Can we go inside right now?

26:07.391 --> 26:08.391
Well, what's the rush?

26:08.425 --> 26:10.792
My boss is next door
decorating the house.

26:10.927 --> 26:12.994
Is that a problem?

26:13.129 --> 26:14.996
It is if I want to keep my job.

26:25.075 --> 26:26.774
Wow, what a beautiful house,

26:26.910 --> 26:28.176
but it seems so unfinished.

26:28.312 --> 26:30.345
Well, I bought it as an
investment property.

26:30.480 --> 26:31.624
It's already gone up in value.

26:31.648 --> 26:32.847
This is your home.

26:32.982 --> 26:34.927
Yeah, but I'm never here.
I'm working all the time.

26:34.951 --> 26:36.311
So you can afford
a beautiful house

26:36.353 --> 26:37.353
that you can never enjoy.

26:38.522 --> 26:39.387
Show me more.

26:39.523 --> 26:41.022
Okay.

26:42.759 --> 26:44.192
Uh, the only thing I use in here

26:44.328 --> 26:45.427
is the coffeemaker.

26:45.562 --> 26:48.396
The kitchen is supposed to
be the heart of the home.

26:48.532 --> 26:50.265
So do a little CPR.

26:52.969 --> 26:53.969
Oh, sorry.

26:55.171 --> 26:57.905
Yeah, I gotta get back to work.

26:58.041 --> 27:00.408
But you...

27:00.544 --> 27:03.878
you are going to need a key.

27:04.013 --> 27:05.046
And...

27:05.181 --> 27:06.014
Thank you.

27:06.149 --> 27:08.116
A credit card.

27:08.252 --> 27:09.684
Do whatever you want,

27:09.819 --> 27:12.521
warmth as far as
the eye can see.

27:12.656 --> 27:13.821
And very, very...

27:13.957 --> 27:15.257
Christmassy.

27:15.392 --> 27:16.392
You love that word.

27:16.460 --> 27:17.292
What exactly does that mean?

27:17.427 --> 27:20.094
It means my boss's wife
will be impressed.

27:21.331 --> 27:22.164
Gotta go.

27:22.299 --> 27:23.632
See you.

27:23.767 --> 27:24.767
Bye.

27:30.507 --> 27:34.108
I am going to bring you to life.

27:40.717 --> 27:41.583
Thanks, everyone!

27:41.718 --> 27:43.818
See you in a couple of hours.

27:45.188 --> 27:46.054
Hello?

27:46.189 --> 27:47.289
Oh, hello, darling,

27:47.424 --> 27:49.057
it's your beleaguered
Aunt Lorraine.

27:50.193 --> 27:51.493
Hey, what's the problem?

27:51.628 --> 27:53.528
<i>Oh, it's the toy drive.</i>

27:53.664 --> 27:54.429
<i>It's simply overwhelming.</i>

27:54.564 --> 27:55.564
I need your help.

27:55.699 --> 28:00.101
Uh, I'm a little
busy at the moment,

28:00.236 --> 28:01.269
but I'll do what I can.

28:01.405 --> 28:02.504
Oh, good.

28:02.639 --> 28:04.639
I knew you wouldn't let me down.

28:06.176 --> 28:07.409
Where are you going?

28:07.544 --> 28:08.943
Uh, my lunch break.

28:09.078 --> 28:10.645
Oh, pick up the silver wreath

28:10.781 --> 28:12.380
for the Fletcher house
on your way back?

28:12.516 --> 28:14.182
And grab me a mocha latte,

28:14.318 --> 28:15.318
sugar-free.

28:20.724 --> 28:21.889
Oh, thank heaven you're here.

28:22.025 --> 28:24.192
There is so much to do.

28:24.328 --> 28:26.160
There certainly is.

28:26.296 --> 28:27.962
Is it just the two of us?

28:28.097 --> 28:30.565
No, no, there's help on the way.

28:31.735 --> 28:33.535
Hey, sorry I'm late.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.437
Oh...

28:35.572 --> 28:36.732
You girls have so much to do,

28:36.773 --> 28:39.474
and I so appreciate
you being here.

28:39.609 --> 28:40.609
Layla...

28:40.744 --> 28:42.455
when are you going to let
me take you shopping

28:42.479 --> 28:43.945
for a wedding dress?

28:44.981 --> 28:46.180
Soon.

28:46.316 --> 28:47.449
I promise.

28:47.584 --> 28:51.052
I've just... I've been so busy
with work and the tour...

28:51.187 --> 28:52.187
Yeah.

28:52.322 --> 28:54.322
Well, we've got a lot to do.

28:54.458 --> 28:56.057
Christmas is right
around the corner.

28:56.192 --> 28:57.225
Let's get busy.

29:08.238 --> 29:09.604
So,

29:09.740 --> 29:11.038
you two are family,

29:11.174 --> 29:13.174
and that's forever.

29:13.309 --> 29:17.379
You've got to learn
to get along.

29:17.514 --> 29:19.581
You make meddling an art form.

29:21.718 --> 29:24.619
Well, at least that's
one thing we agree on.

29:26.356 --> 29:27.555
Well, the galling thing is,

29:27.691 --> 29:30.292
I'm usually right.

29:39.785 --> 29:43.587
This is not the way
these things are done.

29:43.722 --> 29:46.324
Love doesn't operate
according to schedule.

29:46.459 --> 29:48.492
Which is where good
judgment comes in.

29:48.627 --> 29:49.961
When do we get to meet her?

29:50.096 --> 29:51.895
I'm going to have to call Layla.

29:52.031 --> 29:52.896
She's very busy.

29:53.032 --> 29:53.764
Well, what does she do?

29:53.899 --> 29:55.099
She's an interior decorator.

29:55.234 --> 29:57.969
Actually, she's doing my house
for the Holiday Tour of Homes.

29:58.104 --> 29:59.837
What do you know
about this girl?

29:59.972 --> 30:01.172
All I need to.

30:01.307 --> 30:03.807
Well said.

30:07.280 --> 30:08.512
On that note,

30:08.647 --> 30:09.480
I'm going to go.

30:09.615 --> 30:11.048
I've got an early meeting.

30:11.184 --> 30:12.016
Bye, Mom.

30:12.151 --> 30:13.017
Bye bye.

30:13.152 --> 30:14.018
You let me know

30:14.153 --> 30:15.264
when you and Layla are
available for dinner.

30:15.288 --> 30:16.687
Okay.

30:24.630 --> 30:25.630
Well, that looks

30:25.664 --> 30:28.565
suspiciously traditional to me.

30:28.701 --> 30:31.068
I'm making a Christmas quilt.

30:31.204 --> 30:32.484
To use in the house you're doing

30:32.572 --> 30:33.572
for the Tour of Homes?

30:33.672 --> 30:34.738
Don't bother denying it.

30:34.873 --> 30:36.640
I saw your name on the list.

30:36.775 --> 30:38.775
I was going to tell you.

30:38.911 --> 30:40.289
You know, because I'm
doing the Fletcher house,

30:40.313 --> 30:42.146
this puts us in
direct competition.

30:42.281 --> 30:45.082
No, I don't see it that way.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.784
I mean, there are
a lot of homes,

30:47.920 --> 30:51.122
lovely homes for
people to look at.

30:51.257 --> 30:54.925
People like Stanley Malcolm?

30:55.995 --> 30:59.363
Every decorator in town wants
a job with Malcolm Realty,

30:59.499 --> 31:00.731
including me.

31:00.866 --> 31:04.502
How did you get
the Murphy house?

31:04.637 --> 31:06.737
Seth is an old friend,

31:06.872 --> 31:09.773
and we started dating, and...

31:09.908 --> 31:11.942
now we're sort of engaged.

31:12.077 --> 31:13.377
Oh.

31:13.513 --> 31:15.179
I guess congratulations
are in order.

31:15.314 --> 31:18.182
Thank you.

31:18.317 --> 31:20.484
It pains me to say this, Layla,

31:20.620 --> 31:22.953
but obviously we
can't work together.

31:23.088 --> 31:25.556
Wait, are you firing me?

31:25.691 --> 31:27.624
You've given me no choice.

31:29.562 --> 31:30.761
I need those back.

31:48.347 --> 31:51.582
Well, I love what you've
done with the place.

31:55.120 --> 31:58.089
Well, now I really need
Stanley to give me this job

31:58.224 --> 31:59.923
because Darcy just fired me.

32:00.059 --> 32:02.025
What?

32:02.161 --> 32:03.927
This is my fault.

32:04.063 --> 32:07.131
No, I'm just as much to blame.

32:07.266 --> 32:08.099
On the bright side,

32:08.234 --> 32:09.900
I don't have to
deal with her ego,

32:10.035 --> 32:11.635
or fetch her mocha lattes,

32:11.770 --> 32:13.204
sugar-free.

32:13.339 --> 32:15.406
Well, maybe it's for the best.

32:15.541 --> 32:17.774
I really gotta get back to work.

32:17.910 --> 32:21.011
The Tour is less
than two weeks away,

32:21.146 --> 32:22.946
and as you can see,

32:23.082 --> 32:24.615
I still have a lot to do.

32:24.750 --> 32:26.430
I like what you've done
with the fireplace.

32:26.519 --> 32:27.951
Thanks.

32:28.087 --> 32:29.320
You should use it sometime.

32:29.455 --> 32:30.754
Mm-hm.

32:33.125 --> 32:35.126
What?

32:35.261 --> 32:37.128
You've got some...

32:37.263 --> 32:38.583
you've got some
dirt on your face.

32:42.468 --> 32:44.735
Uh... there.

32:44.870 --> 32:45.902
Oh.

32:47.673 --> 32:48.839
My dad called.

32:48.974 --> 32:50.907
He invited us to dinner tonight.

32:51.043 --> 32:51.875
Okay.

32:52.010 --> 32:53.130
No, actually, it's not okay,

32:53.246 --> 32:54.456
because he thinks we're engaged,

32:54.480 --> 32:57.914
and my brother is
already suspicious.

32:58.050 --> 32:59.216
And what about your mother?

33:00.686 --> 33:03.053
She actually passed away
when I was a little girl.

33:03.188 --> 33:05.623
I'm sorry. I didn't know that.

33:05.758 --> 33:08.192
She always used to make
the holidays so special,

33:08.327 --> 33:10.894
and she would turn
our entire house

33:11.029 --> 33:13.564
into this virtual
winter wonderland.

33:13.699 --> 33:15.199
She'd make her own decorations,

33:15.334 --> 33:17.168
and the whole place
smelled like cinnamon

33:17.303 --> 33:18.935
and hot cider...

33:19.071 --> 33:21.705
What was your favorite
part of Christmas?

33:23.108 --> 33:24.508
Everything.

33:24.644 --> 33:27.578
The whole spirit of Christmas.

33:30.283 --> 33:32.283
My mom always said it
was the time of year

33:32.418 --> 33:34.185
that everyone cared
just a little bit more.

33:34.320 --> 33:35.852
What, and you still
feel that way

33:35.988 --> 33:37.120
after all these years?

33:38.391 --> 33:39.391
Of course.

33:39.458 --> 33:41.625
Tell me about your family.

33:43.095 --> 33:46.163
My family...

33:46.299 --> 33:49.200
Well, let's just
say that my dad,

33:49.335 --> 33:51.202
he didn't care too
much for the holidays.

33:51.337 --> 33:53.136
What does he do?

33:53.272 --> 33:54.905
He's a retired
investment banker.

33:55.040 --> 33:57.608
He worked most of his life.

33:57.743 --> 33:59.410
Not a lot of father-and-son time

33:59.545 --> 34:01.212
when I was growing up.

34:01.347 --> 34:02.112
But I looked up to him,

34:02.247 --> 34:04.047
so I followed in his footsteps.

34:05.418 --> 34:08.185
Well, this year, brace yourself

34:08.321 --> 34:09.920
for all the Christmas
you can handle.

34:11.023 --> 34:12.856
The O'Reillys still
go way over the top

34:12.991 --> 34:15.025
when it comes to the holidays.

34:15.159 --> 34:17.393
I think I'd like that.

34:21.033 --> 34:22.466
I'm not much of a cook,

34:22.601 --> 34:24.067
but I enjoy it,

34:24.203 --> 34:25.768
especially this time of year.

34:25.904 --> 34:29.106
Well, everything was
delicious, sir.

34:29.241 --> 34:30.541
So, when did you and Layla meet?

34:30.676 --> 34:32.275
We met three years ago,

34:32.411 --> 34:33.744
doing community theater.

34:33.879 --> 34:35.812
I kept going, hoping
to see more of her.

34:35.947 --> 34:38.415
I remember you singing at
the top of your lungs,

34:38.551 --> 34:40.417
and you were the worst
singer of all time.

34:41.620 --> 34:43.254
He's the only person I know

34:43.389 --> 34:44.829
who can turn "Les
Mis" into a comedy.

34:45.424 --> 34:46.424
Thanks for that.

34:47.393 --> 34:48.458
Then what happened?

34:48.594 --> 34:49.833
I went out of town on business.

34:49.862 --> 34:51.382
By the time I got
back, Layla met Jack,

34:51.464 --> 34:53.264
and I lost my shot.

34:53.399 --> 34:54.164
Well, why didn't you
ever ask me out?

34:54.299 --> 34:55.931
I'd just come out
of a relationship.

34:56.068 --> 34:57.934
I needed a little time.

34:58.070 --> 34:59.737
I assumed you
weren't interested.

34:59.872 --> 35:00.912
No, I was very interested.

35:01.006 --> 35:02.206
I just couldn't undercut Jack.

35:04.477 --> 35:05.842
I was born in a suit and tie.

35:05.978 --> 35:08.078
But you got me to loosen
up and have a little fun,

35:08.213 --> 35:09.280
albeit off-key.

35:11.016 --> 35:14.485
But that was my favorite
summer I can remember.

35:14.620 --> 35:17.421
I wish you would have
told me that back then.

35:17.556 --> 35:19.122
So do I.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.192
Yeah, so do I.

35:23.529 --> 35:25.929
So, you two are about
to get hitched,

35:26.064 --> 35:28.766
and this stuff just
never came up?

35:28.901 --> 35:30.634
Oh... yes.

35:30.770 --> 35:31.635
Of course it did.

35:31.771 --> 35:32.771
We just, um,

35:32.838 --> 35:35.172
we don't like to
dwell on the past.

35:35.307 --> 35:36.006
We like to focus on the future.

35:36.141 --> 35:36.840
The future.

35:36.975 --> 35:38.309
The future.

35:38.444 --> 35:39.976
Speaking of which,
when's the wedding?

35:40.112 --> 35:41.545
Yeah.

35:41.680 --> 35:44.315
Uh... well...

35:44.450 --> 35:46.350
Um, well, we've...

35:46.485 --> 35:47.284
we've, uh...

35:47.420 --> 35:48.540
we've talked about it a lot.

35:49.488 --> 35:50.187
Uh, we were thinking...

35:50.322 --> 35:51.388
June? June, right?

35:51.524 --> 35:52.389
June?

35:52.525 --> 35:53.802
Is that what we said?
June. Mm-hm.

35:53.826 --> 35:54.826
Yeah. June wedding.

35:54.860 --> 35:56.193
So not in December?

35:56.328 --> 35:58.228
December?

35:58.363 --> 36:00.197
No, December's a
little too soon.

36:00.332 --> 36:01.865
Is it?

36:02.000 --> 36:05.001
But Layla always wanted
to be a December bride.

36:07.840 --> 36:08.672
Yeah, I mean...

36:08.808 --> 36:11.642
you knew that.

36:11.777 --> 36:13.510
Yeah, sure he did.

36:13.646 --> 36:14.745
Obviously.

36:14.880 --> 36:18.281
I told him how much
I love Christmas,

36:18.417 --> 36:20.150
and Mom was a December bride,

36:20.285 --> 36:22.586
and with all the love
and joy in the air,

36:22.721 --> 36:23.832
what better time to get married?

36:23.856 --> 36:24.856
December.

36:24.890 --> 36:25.723
Remember?

36:25.858 --> 36:26.690
Uh-huh.

36:26.826 --> 36:28.225
And every year,

36:28.360 --> 36:29.092
how we watched "White
Christmas" on TV,

36:29.227 --> 36:30.060
and with all the singing

36:30.195 --> 36:31.462
and the dancing,

36:31.597 --> 36:33.296
and everyone falls
in love in the end.

36:33.432 --> 36:35.176
I mean, you don't have to tell him.
He knows.

36:35.200 --> 36:35.866
You've seen it.

36:36.001 --> 36:36.834
It's Gene Kelly.

36:36.969 --> 36:37.668
Bing Crosby.

36:37.803 --> 36:38.602
Bing Crosby.

36:38.737 --> 36:39.603
It's no big deal,

36:39.738 --> 36:41.605
it's just your fiancée's

36:41.740 --> 36:43.073
favorite movie of all time,

36:43.208 --> 36:44.040
for her entire life...

36:44.176 --> 36:45.642
Who's ready for dessert?

36:45.778 --> 36:46.543
I am.

36:46.679 --> 36:48.512
Here, let me give you
a hand with that.

36:48.647 --> 36:49.647
Okay.

36:55.721 --> 36:57.120
What's going on?

36:58.357 --> 36:59.357
What?

36:59.424 --> 37:00.457
What do you mean?

37:00.593 --> 37:02.926
Your dentist knows you
better than that guy.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.296
I'm not buying a word of this.

37:07.566 --> 37:08.766
I'm not.

37:15.591 --> 37:17.424
Okay...

37:17.560 --> 37:18.926
so it's a fake engagement.

37:19.062 --> 37:19.927
Promise me...

37:20.063 --> 37:21.362
Hey, look at me...

37:21.497 --> 37:23.898
Promise me you
won't tell anyone.

37:24.033 --> 37:25.033
Tell them what?

37:25.168 --> 37:26.928
That my sister's had a
little too much eggnog

37:26.970 --> 37:28.569
with her fake fiancé,

37:28.704 --> 37:30.972
who also broke up her
real engagement?

37:31.107 --> 37:32.140
Very funny.

37:32.275 --> 37:33.574
He's not so bad.

37:33.709 --> 37:36.043
Yeah, unless you like honesty.

37:36.179 --> 37:37.179
You know what,

37:37.247 --> 37:39.113
people could say the
same thing about me.

37:40.216 --> 37:41.216
Good point.

37:41.284 --> 37:43.651
I don't know, it's...

37:43.786 --> 37:46.154
He's a really nice guy.

37:47.490 --> 37:49.857
I know that look.

37:51.995 --> 37:53.060
What look?

37:54.797 --> 37:56.441
Are you starting to have
feelings for this guy?

37:56.465 --> 37:57.498
What?

37:57.633 --> 37:58.499
No.

37:58.634 --> 38:01.368
Maybe you're not being
honest with yourself.

38:02.571 --> 38:03.437
Maybe.

38:03.572 --> 38:05.940
I tend to do that, a lot.

38:06.075 --> 38:08.309
I mean, with Jack, I knew...

38:08.444 --> 38:10.211
I knew all along.

38:10.346 --> 38:11.078
We were drifting apart,

38:11.214 --> 38:12.780
and I just kept hanging on

38:12.916 --> 38:16.617
to this fantasy of being
a December bride.

38:16.752 --> 38:18.352
And what about Seth?

38:19.889 --> 38:22.990
I don't know how I feel.

38:23.126 --> 38:24.303
I know that I don't
want to get hurt.

38:24.327 --> 38:26.560
That I believe.

38:29.065 --> 38:30.731
Can you pass me the
cookie tin, please?

38:36.439 --> 38:37.839
The Tour is only one week away,

38:37.974 --> 38:40.908
and I haven't even finished
a single room yet.

38:44.247 --> 38:45.880
What do you think?

38:46.015 --> 38:48.049
It's a big change, but
a very merry one.

38:48.184 --> 38:49.624
I'm not sure I'm man
enough for this.

38:49.752 --> 38:51.018
I should be older and wiser.

38:51.154 --> 38:53.187
Are you kidding? It's
perfect for you.

38:53.323 --> 38:54.455
Try it out.

39:02.865 --> 39:04.565
And what exactly

39:04.700 --> 39:06.300
am I supposed to
do in this chair?

39:06.436 --> 39:08.169
You're supposed to
think great thoughts.

39:09.339 --> 39:11.505
Huh.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.607
Well, I'm thinking
great thoughts.

39:13.742 --> 39:16.777
About what?

39:16.912 --> 39:19.747
About my growing affection
for all things Christmas.

39:21.184 --> 39:23.084
It's hard to resist.

39:45.408 --> 39:47.375
Nice wreath.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.510
Nice wreath!

39:48.644 --> 39:49.944
Thanks!

39:50.079 --> 39:51.079
I made it myself.

39:51.214 --> 39:53.580
It looks very authentic.

39:53.716 --> 39:56.650
Yours is... shiny.

40:19.375 --> 40:20.408
Whoa.

40:22.111 --> 40:22.977
Hi.

40:23.112 --> 40:24.678
More donations.

40:24.813 --> 40:26.025
Jessica asked me
to drop them off.

40:26.049 --> 40:26.914
Oh.

40:27.050 --> 40:28.382
But I'm glad I ran into you.

40:28.518 --> 40:31.252
Why?

40:31.387 --> 40:34.088
Because I'd like a...

40:34.223 --> 40:35.889
a chance for us to talk.

40:37.726 --> 40:40.928
Yeah, I don't think I'm
ready for that just yet,

40:41.064 --> 40:42.997
but I'll take the boxes.

40:44.534 --> 40:45.666
Whoop...

40:47.336 --> 40:49.070
I got it.

41:01.284 --> 41:04.818
Oh, you two were so close
when you were little.

41:04.954 --> 41:06.854
That was a lifetime ago.

41:06.989 --> 41:11.058
You shared your dolls, you
shared your clothes...

41:11.194 --> 41:12.826
But not our fiancés.

41:17.766 --> 41:21.268
You were so outgoing
and friendly.

41:21.404 --> 41:23.537
I wanted to be just like you.

41:23.672 --> 41:24.872
Everyone always wanted

41:25.007 --> 41:26.240
to be your friend.

41:26.375 --> 41:27.408
You never told me that.

41:34.083 --> 41:35.216
Sorry.

41:38.454 --> 41:42.189
Well, I couldn't feel any worse,

41:42.325 --> 41:43.924
if that helps.

41:45.361 --> 41:47.194
I had no one to talk to,

41:47.330 --> 41:49.730
not even Aunt Lorraine,

41:49.865 --> 41:52.199
and I wasn't going to
make her pick a side.

41:52.335 --> 41:53.534
Layla...

41:53.669 --> 41:54.935
sometimes your mother and I

41:55.070 --> 41:56.937
wouldn't talk for weeks,

41:57.072 --> 41:58.339
but then, you know,

41:58.474 --> 42:00.274
eventually, we'd just
sort it out in the end.

42:00.409 --> 42:02.643
I love you both.

42:02.778 --> 42:04.445
And we're family.

42:04.580 --> 42:06.580
Families should always
try and work it out.

42:10.219 --> 42:13.687
I want to be family again too.

42:17.493 --> 42:18.559
Oh.

42:18.694 --> 42:21.062
I gotta get going.

42:34.210 --> 42:36.410
Mom, is she ever
going to forgive me?

42:36.546 --> 42:41.014
Well, I think you two
just made a big step.

42:41.150 --> 42:42.150
Yeah?

42:42.251 --> 42:43.584
Yeah.

43:03.772 --> 43:05.050
Wait, wait, let me
try this again.

43:05.074 --> 43:05.939
Okay, you ready?

43:06.075 --> 43:07.075
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:08.010 --> 43:09.010
Hi!

43:09.144 --> 43:10.411
Oh, you're home, hey.

43:10.546 --> 43:11.612
Yeah.

43:11.747 --> 43:12.946
I had to work late.

43:13.082 --> 43:14.881
This is my neighbor, Cooper.

43:15.017 --> 43:17.084
I was unable to get
a delivery truck,

43:17.220 --> 43:18.285
and Cooper went

43:18.421 --> 43:19.701
and picked up the chairs for us.

43:21.123 --> 43:21.989
This is Seth.

43:22.124 --> 43:23.124
Oh yeah, your fiancé?

43:23.259 --> 43:24.259
That's me.

43:24.327 --> 43:25.192
Nice to meet you.

43:25.328 --> 43:26.960
Nice to meet you, too.

43:27.096 --> 43:29.497
So, you're the one
that got the flu?

43:29.632 --> 43:31.499
Yup.

43:31.634 --> 43:33.212
Listen, thanks very much
for helping Layla out.

43:33.236 --> 43:34.236
I appreciate it.

43:34.370 --> 43:35.603
No problem.

43:39.242 --> 43:41.008
I gotta get going.

43:42.478 --> 43:43.544
Sure?

43:43.679 --> 43:45.045
Yeah.

43:46.181 --> 43:47.248
I owe you dinner.

43:47.383 --> 43:49.116
No, really, that's okay.

43:50.486 --> 43:51.486
Nice to meet you.

43:51.587 --> 43:52.827
I'm just gonna go walk him out.

43:52.855 --> 43:53.855
Great.

43:55.991 --> 43:58.459
Phew, it's cold out here.

43:58.594 --> 44:00.628
Thank you again for
all your help.

44:00.763 --> 44:03.664
No problem.

44:03.799 --> 44:06.900
I guess you really are engaged.

44:10.439 --> 44:14.475
That guy's in love.

44:17.580 --> 44:19.046
Drive safe.

44:34.730 --> 44:36.129
So, you like the chairs?

44:36.265 --> 44:37.898
Yeah. Yeah, they're great.

44:38.033 --> 44:39.233
Now people have a place to sit

44:39.268 --> 44:40.279
if they have a piece of pie,

44:40.303 --> 44:41.303
or a coffee,

44:41.370 --> 44:42.614
or you can eat your
breakfast here.

44:42.638 --> 44:45.138
So, Cooper seems
like a nice guy.

44:45.274 --> 44:46.307
Aw, he's so sweet.

44:46.442 --> 44:48.108
And he's your neighbor?

44:48.243 --> 44:49.810
Just your neighbor?

44:49.945 --> 44:51.845
Yeah, he's my neighbor,

44:51.980 --> 44:54.248
and my friend.

44:54.383 --> 44:55.649
Why?

44:55.785 --> 44:57.585
No reason.

44:57.720 --> 44:59.186
Tell me.

44:59.322 --> 45:00.654
Look...

45:00.790 --> 45:03.957
I know we're supposed to be
just a fake engaged couple,

45:04.092 --> 45:06.993
but I gotta be
completely honest here,

45:07.129 --> 45:08.649
I just didn't like
it when I walked in,

45:08.731 --> 45:11.432
and I saw you two
together in my kitchen.

45:11.567 --> 45:13.734
Are you jealous?

45:13.869 --> 45:16.604
Maybe I am, a little.

45:18.006 --> 45:21.308
This is too much reality
for a fake engagement.

45:21.444 --> 45:22.976
Fair enough.

45:23.111 --> 45:24.478
Let's keep things light and fun.

45:24.613 --> 45:25.879
Light and fun.

45:26.014 --> 45:27.548
It's getting late, I should...

45:27.683 --> 45:28.683
I should probably go.

45:28.784 --> 45:31.017
Layla...

45:33.789 --> 45:36.457
All I'm really trying to say

45:36.592 --> 45:37.791
is that everywhere I look,

45:37.926 --> 45:40.361
I see Christmas, and I see you,

45:40.496 --> 45:43.029
and I love it.

45:44.132 --> 45:45.932
That's all.

45:49.204 --> 45:51.972
I should go.

46:07.582 --> 46:09.115
You sure it's not too much?

46:09.250 --> 46:10.917
No, I think it looks good.

46:13.354 --> 46:14.387
Whoa!

46:18.393 --> 46:20.359
I'm going to go get
some pinecones

46:20.495 --> 46:22.095
from the box of pinecones.

46:22.230 --> 46:23.230
Okay.

46:35.911 --> 46:37.543
What am I doing?

46:43.919 --> 46:46.653
♪ Deck the halls with
boughs of holly ♪

46:46.788 --> 46:48.855
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la ♪

46:50.258 --> 46:52.492
Bravo.

46:52.627 --> 46:53.660
It's beautiful.

46:55.230 --> 46:57.497
This is much more fun than work.

46:59.835 --> 47:02.068
Tomorrow, I'm thinking
we should get the tree

47:02.204 --> 47:03.380
before all the good
ones are gone.

47:03.404 --> 47:04.481
Yeah, I just have to stop
and get some ornaments

47:04.505 --> 47:05.371
on the way.

47:05.506 --> 47:07.173
Great.

47:10.645 --> 47:11.689
♪ Deck the halls with
boughs of holly ♪

47:11.713 --> 47:14.213
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la ♪

47:14.349 --> 47:16.282
Maybe you should
sing at the Tour.

47:16.417 --> 47:17.817
Maybe not.

47:23.925 --> 47:25.485
That is the biggest
tree I've ever seen.

47:25.593 --> 47:26.760
Yup.

47:26.895 --> 47:30.563
You know, the one concession
my father had at Christmastime

47:30.698 --> 47:33.733
was to choose the biggest,
most expensive tree

47:33.869 --> 47:34.912
he could pay someone to get.

47:34.936 --> 47:36.670
I'm glad we did this.

47:36.805 --> 47:37.805
See, we were opposite.

47:37.873 --> 47:39.338
We would get the smallest tree

47:39.474 --> 47:40.874
from the supermarket
parking lot.

47:41.977 --> 47:43.376
We'd keep it alive
until January,

47:43.511 --> 47:45.311
and it became this
member of the family.

47:45.446 --> 47:47.513
That's weird.

47:49.350 --> 47:51.818
Uh, do you need a
hand with that?

47:51.953 --> 47:53.920
Uh, no, I got it.

47:54.055 --> 47:55.055
You sure?

47:55.123 --> 47:57.190
Yeah, I'm sure.

47:57.325 --> 47:59.592
Whoa... Whoa, whoa!

47:59.727 --> 48:01.861
Do you need a hand now?

48:01.997 --> 48:04.097
Uh, if you insist.

48:04.232 --> 48:05.331
Here, give it to me.

48:05.466 --> 48:06.566
Okay.

48:06.701 --> 48:08.034
Okay, one, two...

48:08.170 --> 48:09.468
three!

48:09.604 --> 48:10.837
You got it?

48:10.972 --> 48:11.838
Yeah, yeah.

48:11.973 --> 48:13.339
Oh, slivers...

48:16.278 --> 48:18.277
Now, that is what
I call teamwork.

48:18.413 --> 48:22.548
I'd say this calls for
two cups of hot cocoa.

48:22.684 --> 48:24.984
I think we've earned it.

48:36.064 --> 48:38.331
Why the smile?

48:38.466 --> 48:41.901
Because this is what
Christmas is all about.

48:42.037 --> 48:43.069
Here.

48:43.205 --> 48:44.303
Thank you.

48:44.439 --> 48:45.138
Ooh...

48:45.273 --> 48:46.439
Watch your hands.

48:46.574 --> 48:47.807
It's not about

48:47.943 --> 48:49.308
the finished product,

48:49.444 --> 48:52.411
it's about the process.

48:52.547 --> 48:56.116
The hanging the stockings,
the decorating the tree.

48:56.251 --> 48:58.084
These are the things
we'll remember.

48:58.220 --> 49:00.120
Well, my mother
always hired someone

49:00.255 --> 49:01.255
to decorate the tree.

49:06.261 --> 49:08.261
What's she like?

49:08.396 --> 49:09.595
My mom?

49:09.731 --> 49:10.797
Yeah.

49:10.932 --> 49:13.366
Uh, she's as charming
as my father is proper.

49:13.501 --> 49:16.369
But he would be completely
lost without her.

49:17.572 --> 49:18.572
Cheers.

49:18.639 --> 49:20.006
Cheers.

49:24.312 --> 49:25.312
Did you make those?

49:25.380 --> 49:26.913
My mom did.

49:27.048 --> 49:28.581
Well, they're beautiful.

49:28.716 --> 49:30.984
They are, aren't they?

49:34.055 --> 49:36.722
She would make gingerbread
cookies every year,

49:36.858 --> 49:40.326
and whatever we didn't eat,
we'd hang on the tree.

49:41.930 --> 49:43.450
Those are some of my
favorite memories.

49:43.531 --> 49:45.598
Sometimes I feel
like they're just...

49:45.733 --> 49:47.566
I feel like they're
slipping away.

49:51.506 --> 49:54.107
Do you wanna help me
string some popcorn?

49:54.242 --> 49:55.708
I thought you'd never ask.

49:57.078 --> 49:58.144
It's actually really fun.

49:58.280 --> 49:59.412
Okay.

49:59.547 --> 50:00.379
Okay.

50:00.515 --> 50:01.681
Hold this.

50:01.816 --> 50:02.816
String.

50:02.850 --> 50:03.983
Yeah, string.

50:04.119 --> 50:05.119
So, like...

50:05.220 --> 50:06.052
Seth...

50:06.187 --> 50:08.087
It fell in my mouth.

50:08.223 --> 50:09.767
You're not supposed to
eat the decorations.

50:09.791 --> 50:11.590
Okay.

50:11.726 --> 50:12.892
String it on there, yeah.

50:13.028 --> 50:14.028
Ready?

50:14.062 --> 50:15.062
Yes.

50:16.164 --> 50:18.064
Oh, this is so good,
I can't stop it.

50:18.199 --> 50:20.766
This is my last bag of popcorn.

50:20.902 --> 50:22.969
Okay, you do it like this.

50:25.006 --> 50:25.738
Voila.

50:25.873 --> 50:26.873
Voila.

50:28.476 --> 50:29.876
This is a good memory.

50:31.212 --> 50:34.214
Yeah, it is.

50:35.483 --> 50:37.016
It's really good.

50:53.568 --> 50:55.768
When will your mom be back?

50:55.903 --> 51:01.241
I think she wanted to
give us some time alone.

51:02.510 --> 51:04.143
Okay...

51:08.216 --> 51:11.084
Do you remember
Fashion Model Barbie?

51:13.088 --> 51:14.287
Sort of.

51:16.024 --> 51:17.490
What she lacked in substance,

51:17.625 --> 51:22.561
she made up for in flair.

51:22.697 --> 51:25.164
Kinda like me.

51:26.601 --> 51:28.634
Are you waiting for
me to contradict you?

51:28.769 --> 51:31.504
I'm waiting for you
to forgive me.

51:36.511 --> 51:39.712
I never meant to hurt you.

51:41.649 --> 51:43.616
I fell in love.

51:45.353 --> 51:48.754
I never wanted to lose you.

51:48.890 --> 51:51.391
I miss you.

51:54.629 --> 51:55.761
I miss you too.

51:58.099 --> 51:59.532
I mean, maybe all this

51:59.667 --> 52:01.634
is the way it's meant to be.

52:01.769 --> 52:03.469
We both ended up
with the right guy.

52:07.242 --> 52:08.408
Yeah.

52:08.543 --> 52:10.310
Maybe so.

52:13.048 --> 52:14.680
I know Jack feels terrible

52:14.815 --> 52:17.250
and would love to talk to you.

52:17.385 --> 52:20.719
Let me think about it, okay?

52:23.258 --> 52:25.624
So, where's your
engagement ring?

52:25.760 --> 52:27.860
I'm dying to see it.

52:27.995 --> 52:30.964
It was too... big.

52:31.099 --> 52:33.066
I was hanging a wreath,

52:33.201 --> 52:34.733
and then it just slipped off,

52:34.869 --> 52:35.979
and then so we took
it to the jeweler,

52:36.003 --> 52:37.081
and then when we got it
back from the jeweler,

52:37.105 --> 52:37.937
it was too small,

52:38.073 --> 52:38.771
so now it's getting sized again,

52:38.906 --> 52:40.006
and...

52:40.141 --> 52:41.821
Yeah, we should have
it back in a few days.

52:46.013 --> 52:49.282
How's everything going?

52:49.417 --> 52:51.517
We're making progress.

52:53.088 --> 52:54.520
With you two making up,

52:54.655 --> 52:57.357
now we can spend the
holidays together.

52:57.492 --> 52:58.635
And then there's
Layla's wedding,

52:58.659 --> 53:00.093
whenever that is.

53:00.228 --> 53:01.727
It's too late for a
December wedding,

53:01.862 --> 53:03.029
so don't even go there.

53:03.164 --> 53:05.631
Who said anything about
a December wedding?

53:05.766 --> 53:08.167
No more meddling.

53:08.303 --> 53:09.969
That's what family is for.

53:10.105 --> 53:11.304
I mean it!

53:22.550 --> 53:24.817
Everything looks so
beautiful in here.

53:26.053 --> 53:27.220
It's very Christmassy.

53:27.355 --> 53:29.122
That's good. It should be,

53:29.257 --> 53:30.789
The Tour is only five days away.

53:32.760 --> 53:33.826
So, I'm thinking

53:33.961 --> 53:35.428
I'm going to buy some gifts

53:35.563 --> 53:36.429
to fill the stockings with,

53:36.564 --> 53:38.124
so that they don't
look just like props.

53:38.166 --> 53:39.365
Great.

53:39.501 --> 53:40.599
Great.

53:42.237 --> 53:44.437
You know, Jessica asked about
the engagement ring today.

53:44.506 --> 53:46.272
Oh, yeah?

53:46.407 --> 53:49.042
She's not the first one to ask.

53:49.177 --> 53:51.644
Should I get some costume
jewelry or something?

53:53.548 --> 53:54.947
Uh-oh.

53:57.619 --> 53:58.484
It's Darcy.

53:58.620 --> 54:00.853
She wants me to stop
by the Fletcher house.

54:02.290 --> 54:03.530
She's not even my boss anymore.

54:03.658 --> 54:04.957
I don't know why I'm so nervous.

54:05.092 --> 54:06.559
You'll be fine.

54:08.229 --> 54:10.663
Okay, don't touch anything.

54:12.933 --> 54:13.632
I'll be back soon.

54:13.768 --> 54:15.401
Okay.

54:27.238 --> 54:30.306
What are you doing
with this yard?

54:30.441 --> 54:31.674
I haven't figured it out yet.

54:33.578 --> 54:34.858
Is that why you
wanted to see me?

54:36.514 --> 54:37.834
My silver ornaments
never arrived.

54:37.949 --> 54:39.716
I'm not saying it
was intentional,

54:39.851 --> 54:40.971
although it crossed my mind.

54:41.052 --> 54:43.987
Well, I ordered them
before you fired me.

54:44.122 --> 54:45.989
I suggest you call the vendor.

54:47.092 --> 54:49.492
I ran into Stanley
Malcolm today.

54:49.627 --> 54:51.928
Apparently, he sold
your fiancé his house.

54:52.063 --> 54:54.731
That's right.

54:54.866 --> 54:56.733
How long have you been together?

54:56.868 --> 54:58.901
It's odd that you
never mentioned him.

54:59.037 --> 55:00.402
I'll be right in, honey.

55:00.538 --> 55:01.738
Okay, honey.

55:01.873 --> 55:03.450
Seth and I were just
about to have dinner.

55:03.474 --> 55:04.674
Okay.

55:04.809 --> 55:05.474
I'll see you?

55:05.610 --> 55:06.643
Soon!

55:06.778 --> 55:08.444
Soon...

55:08.579 --> 55:09.579
Put your arm around me.

55:09.680 --> 55:11.000
Let's pretend to
be a real couple.

55:11.082 --> 55:12.314
I can do better than that.

55:14.819 --> 55:16.385
We're practicing
for the big day.

55:16.520 --> 55:17.687
Oh.

55:24.863 --> 55:27.897
You know, Darcy's been
talking to Malcolm.

55:28.032 --> 55:29.666
Oh, then we'd better
put on a good show.

55:29.801 --> 55:31.534
Speaking of which,

55:31.669 --> 55:34.003
check out the stocking
on the right.

55:34.139 --> 55:36.673
Why?

55:38.309 --> 55:40.910
What did you do?

55:45.917 --> 55:47.183
Oh, my gosh.

55:50.421 --> 55:51.721
That was my grandmother's ring.

55:51.856 --> 55:53.355
It's so beautiful.

55:58.596 --> 55:59.696
Here.

56:03.367 --> 56:05.802
It's a perfect fit.

56:05.937 --> 56:08.671
Yeah, it is.

56:18.683 --> 56:19.415
Hi.

56:19.550 --> 56:20.950
Hi.

56:23.354 --> 56:25.654
Thank you for
agreeing to meet me.

56:25.790 --> 56:28.524
I remembered how much you
love the lattes here.

56:28.659 --> 56:30.693
True.

56:30.829 --> 56:32.228
Jack, I'm not...

56:32.363 --> 56:36.132
I don't really know why
you wanted to meet.

56:36.267 --> 56:37.333
Jessica told me

56:37.468 --> 56:40.402
that you two might be
mending things between you,

56:40.538 --> 56:41.637
and, well,

56:41.772 --> 56:43.139
I need to mend
things with you too.

56:43.274 --> 56:46.275
Layla, I really never
meant to hurt you.

56:46.410 --> 56:48.111
Well, then why did you?

56:48.246 --> 56:51.413
You always expected
the best of me.

56:51.549 --> 56:52.849
It was a lot to live up to.

56:52.984 --> 56:54.550
I didn't mean to pressure you.

56:54.685 --> 56:55.551
I know...

56:55.686 --> 56:57.053
I just...

56:57.188 --> 56:58.254
You just what?

56:59.590 --> 57:01.302
We never really took the time
to get to know each other.

57:01.326 --> 57:02.792
And a lot of times,

57:02.927 --> 57:05.128
it felt like we were
just out of sync.

57:05.263 --> 57:06.373
I mean, you were
just so wrapped up

57:06.397 --> 57:08.464
with wanting to be this
December bride that...

57:08.599 --> 57:10.466
That I never really saw you.

57:12.436 --> 57:15.004
Maybe that was on me.

57:15.139 --> 57:16.005
Look, I just know

57:16.140 --> 57:19.075
I want you to forgive me.

57:19.210 --> 57:20.777
I handled everything badly.

57:27.018 --> 57:30.153
We talked about this.

57:30.288 --> 57:35.024
Is... everything okay?

57:35.159 --> 57:38.494
I assume you guys were
just in the neighborhood?

57:40.031 --> 57:42.298
Oh, you know how I
can't stop meddling

57:42.433 --> 57:44.000
when it comes to family.

57:45.069 --> 57:45.734
Layla...

57:45.870 --> 57:48.437
we are both just so happy

57:48.572 --> 57:49.572
for you and Seth.

57:49.707 --> 57:51.941
We'd love to have a dinner,

57:52.076 --> 57:54.811
and maybe we can all start over?

57:56.014 --> 57:58.181
Wow, uh...

57:58.316 --> 57:59.982
I don't know what to say.

58:00.118 --> 58:02.718
Just say yes,

58:02.853 --> 58:06.488
and we'll make the plans.

58:06.624 --> 58:07.624
Yes!

58:08.726 --> 58:09.391
Thank you.

58:09.527 --> 58:11.093
- Yes.
- Okay.

58:13.965 --> 58:16.098
Thank you.

58:17.635 --> 58:19.768
Oh, I am so pleased.

58:20.972 --> 58:23.105
My family is finally
coming together.

58:23.241 --> 58:24.807
And Seth is a wonderful man.

58:24.943 --> 58:27.543
And that couldn't
have been very easy.

58:27.678 --> 58:29.879
No, it wasn't easy.

58:30.014 --> 58:32.281
But you know what,

58:32.417 --> 58:35.651
it was telling.

58:35.786 --> 58:41.757
Because after all the
anger and the resentment,

58:41.892 --> 58:44.493
maybe he just wasn't
the right guy for me.

58:44.628 --> 58:47.529
Oh, honey, I could
have told you that...

58:47.665 --> 58:51.400
the moment you danced with Seth.

59:22.100 --> 59:24.733
I can't believe you did this.

59:29.407 --> 59:30.572
Gingerbread cookies?

59:30.708 --> 59:31.708
I tried.

59:33.944 --> 59:35.844
They smell amazing.

59:35.980 --> 59:38.147
Uh, I'm not great
at the icing part.

59:40.218 --> 59:41.218
Um, here, try.

59:45.490 --> 59:46.989
Mmm.

59:47.125 --> 59:48.824
- Mmm?
- Mmm!

59:48.959 --> 59:49.725
Too much cinnamon?

59:49.860 --> 59:50.860
No, I mean...

59:51.929 --> 59:53.262
Maybe a little.

59:53.398 --> 59:55.798
Not like your mom's.

59:55.933 --> 59:57.466
But just as sweet.

59:58.702 --> 01:00:00.769
Thank you.

01:00:00.905 --> 01:00:04.173
You're welcome.

01:00:05.910 --> 01:00:07.276
So...

01:00:08.712 --> 01:00:10.313
let me tell you something.

01:00:12.150 --> 01:00:14.850
I have decided not
to sell the house.

01:00:14.985 --> 01:00:16.118
When did you decide that?

01:00:16.254 --> 01:00:18.154
Just now.

01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:21.257
You've turned my investment

01:00:21.392 --> 01:00:24.093
into something more valuable.

01:00:24.228 --> 01:00:25.361
A home.

01:00:27.532 --> 01:00:29.231
And I'm home now.

01:00:40.511 --> 01:00:41.777
Someone has very bad timing.

01:00:42.913 --> 01:00:44.813
Yes, they do.

01:00:44.949 --> 01:00:45.949
Hey, Dad.

01:00:46.084 --> 01:00:46.949
<i>Hi.</i>

01:00:47.085 --> 01:00:49.118
I called your office
this morning,

01:00:49.253 --> 01:00:50.330
and they said you'd
gone home for the day.

01:00:50.354 --> 01:00:52.188
Yeah, yeah, I'm at
home helping Layla.

01:00:52.323 --> 01:00:55.858
We hire people for
that sort of thing.

01:00:55.993 --> 01:00:57.860
<i>Yeah, it's fun.</i>

01:00:57.995 --> 01:00:59.595
I made gingerbread cookies.

01:00:59.730 --> 01:01:00.730
I think it's time

01:01:00.798 --> 01:01:02.076
that your mother and
I met your fiancée.

01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:04.066
<i>Please make your mother happy</i>

01:01:04.202 --> 01:01:05.667
and come for dinner tonight.

01:01:05.803 --> 01:01:07.069
Okay.

01:01:07.205 --> 01:01:09.472
Great, see you at 7:00.

01:01:09.607 --> 01:01:10.839
Is she coming?

01:01:10.975 --> 01:01:11.773
Yup.

01:01:11.909 --> 01:01:12.774
Oh, good.

01:01:12.910 --> 01:01:13.954
What are we having for dinner?

01:01:13.978 --> 01:01:15.011
Oh. Oh, boy.

01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:18.147
Is everything okay?

01:01:18.282 --> 01:01:19.282
Fine.

01:01:19.383 --> 01:01:20.527
We're just going to
be having dinner

01:01:20.551 --> 01:01:21.551
with my parents tonight.

01:01:24.021 --> 01:01:25.621
Bring cookies.

01:01:25.756 --> 01:01:26.756
Lots of cookies.

01:01:29.193 --> 01:01:32.495
Doing Seth's house for
the Tour of Homes

01:01:32.630 --> 01:01:34.030
must be very challenging.

01:01:34.165 --> 01:01:36.432
Seth has been a big help.

01:01:36.567 --> 01:01:37.633
Just don't ignore

01:01:37.768 --> 01:01:38.768
your obligations at work.

01:01:40.471 --> 01:01:41.504
Ever the romantic.

01:01:41.639 --> 01:01:44.573
You obviously make my son happy.

01:01:44.708 --> 01:01:46.842
He can't stop talking about you.

01:01:46.977 --> 01:01:48.344
And that's all that matters.

01:01:48.479 --> 01:01:49.912
Very happy, Mom.

01:01:50.047 --> 01:01:51.180
I hope I'm not

01:01:51.315 --> 01:01:52.814
being too forward,

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:54.183
but I have so many ideas

01:01:54.318 --> 01:01:55.318
about the wedding.

01:01:55.453 --> 01:01:58.454
She never stops
talking about it.

01:01:58.589 --> 01:01:59.821
Listen, we... let's...

01:01:59.957 --> 01:02:01.323
We haven't even set a date yet.

01:02:01.459 --> 01:02:03.559
A mother can dream, can't she?

01:02:03.694 --> 01:02:05.928
I have a wedding planner
I'd love you to meet.

01:02:06.063 --> 01:02:06.895
Oh, that's very nice of you...

01:02:07.031 --> 01:02:07.863
And a wonderful florist.

01:02:07.998 --> 01:02:09.532
Oh, I hope you like lilies.

01:02:09.667 --> 01:02:10.499
Lilies are nice.

01:02:10.635 --> 01:02:12.568
Or roses, whatever you prefer.

01:02:12.703 --> 01:02:15.938
Flowers can add so
much to a wedding.

01:02:16.073 --> 01:02:17.083
And then so can the music.

01:02:17.107 --> 01:02:19.341
Perhaps a string quartet?

01:02:19.477 --> 01:02:22.778
I got some samples
from a bakery.

01:02:22.913 --> 01:02:25.247
They specialize
in wedding cakes.

01:02:25.383 --> 01:02:26.182
They look... lovely.

01:02:26.317 --> 01:02:27.516
Let me know what you think.

01:02:27.652 --> 01:02:29.552
I'm partial to the red velvet.

01:02:29.687 --> 01:02:31.287
Perhaps you'd
prefer gingerbread.

01:02:31.422 --> 01:02:32.555
Oh, Layla,

01:02:32.690 --> 01:02:33.522
I'm sorry,

01:02:33.658 --> 01:02:34.723
am I being too pushy?

01:02:34.858 --> 01:02:35.858
Yes.

01:02:35.959 --> 01:02:36.692
No.

01:02:36.827 --> 01:02:38.127
No...

01:02:38.262 --> 01:02:41.163
I'm just... I'm just a
little overwhelmed.

01:02:41.299 --> 01:02:42.864
Yeah.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:44.766
Layla, she's got a
lot on her plate,

01:02:44.902 --> 01:02:46.768
so why don't we just...

01:02:46.904 --> 01:02:50.172
let's talk about the wedding
after the Tour of Homes.

01:02:50.308 --> 01:02:51.740
Of course.

01:02:51.875 --> 01:02:53.515
But I can still help
with all the details.

01:02:54.845 --> 01:02:56.390
Oh, well, that's very,
very sweet of you,

01:02:56.414 --> 01:02:58.147
but totally not necessary.

01:02:58.282 --> 01:02:59.881
Oh, don't worry, dear,

01:03:00.017 --> 01:03:02.551
all my planning and
bending your ear,

01:03:02.687 --> 01:03:05.121
it's just my way of saying...

01:03:05.256 --> 01:03:07.789
welcome to our family.

01:03:13.897 --> 01:03:15.264
Cheers.

01:03:15.399 --> 01:03:16.832
Welcome to the family.

01:03:16.967 --> 01:03:18.734
Cheers.

01:03:23.019 --> 01:03:23.852
Your mom is so nice.

01:03:23.987 --> 01:03:25.398
Every compliment,
every piece of cake,

01:03:25.422 --> 01:03:27.142
I wanted to slip right
underneath the table.

01:03:27.224 --> 01:03:29.158
This thing has gotten
way out of hand.

01:03:29.293 --> 01:03:30.892
Yeah, you think?

01:03:31.027 --> 01:03:32.467
It's not about getting
a job anymore.

01:03:32.496 --> 01:03:35.330
This charade has taken
on a life of its own.

01:03:35.466 --> 01:03:37.599
It's too late to take back now.

01:03:37.735 --> 01:03:41.236
I mean, how would
we ever explain it?

01:03:41.372 --> 01:03:43.738
We'll pretend to break up...

01:03:47.478 --> 01:03:48.977
That's Jessica.

01:03:50.547 --> 01:03:51.346
Hello?

01:03:51.482 --> 01:03:52.482
<i>Hi. Layla.</i>

01:03:52.549 --> 01:03:53.615
Hi. How are you?

01:03:53.751 --> 01:03:55.050
I'm good.

01:03:55.185 --> 01:03:56.485
Hey, um...

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:58.920
how about the four
of us go for dinner

01:03:59.055 --> 01:04:00.355
<i>at Bon Ami,</i>

01:04:00.491 --> 01:04:02.057
<i>like we talked about?</i>

01:04:02.192 --> 01:04:03.992
That's so nice of you.

01:04:04.127 --> 01:04:07.095
It's just, I'm so busy
with the Tour of Homes.

01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:09.231
I haven't had a
second to breathe.

01:04:09.366 --> 01:04:11.766
<i>Oh, well, that's okay.</i>

01:04:11.902 --> 01:04:13.468
I mean, we could do
it after the Tour.

01:04:13.604 --> 01:04:14.604
Maybe Sunday at 7:00?

01:04:14.738 --> 01:04:16.238
Yeah, that sounds good.

01:04:17.408 --> 01:04:19.575
Okay, great, see you then.

01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:20.710
Bye.

01:04:22.012 --> 01:04:23.723
So Jack and Jessica just
invited us to dinner

01:04:23.747 --> 01:04:26.081
at Bon Ami.

01:04:26.216 --> 01:04:27.216
Another dinner

01:04:27.284 --> 01:04:29.384
as a fake couple.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:30.852
Hmm.

01:04:30.987 --> 01:04:34.590
Well, it can't be any
worse than the last ones.

01:04:41.264 --> 01:04:43.332
We only have two days left,

01:04:43.467 --> 01:04:45.701
and the yard is still so blank.

01:04:48.405 --> 01:04:50.071
There's just so
much empty space.

01:04:50.207 --> 01:04:51.573
I don't know how to fill it.

01:04:51.709 --> 01:04:53.408
Well, maybe...

01:04:53.544 --> 01:04:55.143
maybe some Christmas trees,

01:04:55.278 --> 01:04:56.445
or a snowman?

01:04:56.580 --> 01:04:57.700
No, it needs to be original.

01:04:57.781 --> 01:04:58.792
We need to make it stand out

01:04:58.816 --> 01:04:59.816
from the other houses.

01:04:59.883 --> 01:05:00.649
I got it.

01:05:00.784 --> 01:05:03.252
We can use your dad's
plastic Santa.

01:05:04.555 --> 01:05:05.555
That's it.

01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:07.122
I was joking.

01:05:07.257 --> 01:05:10.726
No, not Santa, his sleigh.

01:05:10.861 --> 01:05:12.694
That would look so good there.

01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:13.962
It's the perfect spot.

01:05:14.097 --> 01:05:16.131
Now, how do we find a sleigh

01:05:16.266 --> 01:05:17.999
on such short notice?

01:05:18.134 --> 01:05:20.435
I will find you a sleigh.

01:05:20.571 --> 01:05:22.271
Really? How?

01:05:22.406 --> 01:05:25.641
I have no idea.

01:05:25.776 --> 01:05:27.709
Oh, my gosh,

01:05:27.845 --> 01:05:29.778
Darcy is watching us again.

01:05:29.913 --> 01:05:32.213
Let's give her something to see.

01:05:39.556 --> 01:05:43.191
I wanted to get that
in before we break up.

01:05:45.496 --> 01:05:46.995
Right.

01:06:11.955 --> 01:06:15.223
This is what you choose
to do with your time?

01:06:15.358 --> 01:06:17.492
And I can't find a sleigh.

01:06:17.628 --> 01:06:19.060
I don't understand.

01:06:19.195 --> 01:06:20.862
For the front yard.

01:06:20.997 --> 01:06:24.265
I promised Layla I'd
find her a sleigh.

01:06:24.401 --> 01:06:26.000
I have to question
your priorities.

01:06:26.136 --> 01:06:27.769
Just when I got them straight.

01:06:27.905 --> 01:06:28.737
You're missing work,

01:06:28.872 --> 01:06:30.192
worrying about some
yard ornament.

01:06:31.074 --> 01:06:33.274
Look, it can't be all
about making money, Dad,

01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:34.730
or some role I'm
expected to play.

01:06:34.778 --> 01:06:36.945
I want to...

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.913
I want to enjoy my life.

01:06:41.051 --> 01:06:42.818
Think about it.

01:06:42.953 --> 01:06:44.486
Why didn't we spend
more time together

01:06:44.621 --> 01:06:45.920
when I was growing up, hmm?

01:06:52.429 --> 01:06:55.564
I once asked my father
the exact same question.

01:06:55.699 --> 01:06:59.768
And what did he say?

01:06:59.903 --> 01:07:03.705
He mentioned his busy schedule.

01:07:03.841 --> 01:07:08.477
All I really remember
was his lack of regret.

01:07:10.681 --> 01:07:15.684
I never meant to become
that kind of father, Seth.

01:07:15.819 --> 01:07:17.352
Ever.

01:07:17.488 --> 01:07:20.655
Never too late to
break the mold.

01:07:22.726 --> 01:07:23.726
One more day.

01:07:23.827 --> 01:07:24.693
Yeah,

01:07:24.828 --> 01:07:26.428
and I still haven't
found you a sleigh.

01:07:28.365 --> 01:07:31.165
I've turned Christmas
into a race against time.

01:07:32.970 --> 01:07:34.302
How did we get here?

01:07:36.006 --> 01:07:38.039
A fake engagement,
lying to our families.

01:07:39.943 --> 01:07:41.075
Yeah.

01:07:41.211 --> 01:07:43.845
Well, maybe if I had asked
you out before Jack did,

01:07:43.981 --> 01:07:46.314
we'd be engaged for real.

01:07:48.785 --> 01:07:50.752
Maybe so,

01:07:50.888 --> 01:07:54.523
but we'll never know, right?

01:07:55.759 --> 01:07:57.258
Right.

01:08:02.533 --> 01:08:03.632
There's no happy ending.

01:08:03.767 --> 01:08:06.234
We've complicated things.

01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:09.070
We just need to break
up like we planned.

01:08:10.273 --> 01:08:12.240
If that's what you really want.

01:08:15.145 --> 01:08:19.013
It doesn't matter what I want.

01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:20.849
At this point,

01:08:20.984 --> 01:08:24.586
all that matters is I don't
want to hurt my family.

01:08:25.822 --> 01:08:28.189
I have to go meet
my Aunt Lorraine.

01:08:28.323 --> 01:08:29.457
Okay.

01:08:47.310 --> 01:08:50.578
Oh! You look exquisite.

01:08:50.714 --> 01:08:52.279
I'm so glad

01:08:52.415 --> 01:08:54.549
you decided to wear
your mother's dress.

01:08:56.286 --> 01:08:57.352
I should take it off.

01:08:57.487 --> 01:08:58.487
Oh, no, no, wait!

01:08:58.589 --> 01:08:59.589
For what?

01:08:59.656 --> 01:09:00.488
Oh, I was hoping

01:09:00.624 --> 01:09:01.857
that putting on the dress

01:09:01.992 --> 01:09:04.693
would be the prompt
that you needed.

01:09:06.063 --> 01:09:07.696
What do you mean?

01:09:07.831 --> 01:09:09.663
To be a December bride.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:12.533
I know how much it means to you,

01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:15.169
and you're running out of time.

01:09:21.377 --> 01:09:23.478
What is it?

01:09:23.613 --> 01:09:25.613
Honey, what is it?

01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:30.652
I have something I
have to tell you.

01:09:30.787 --> 01:09:32.821
Okay.

01:09:34.658 --> 01:09:38.459
Seth and I aren't engaged.

01:09:46.870 --> 01:09:48.837
Well...

01:09:48.971 --> 01:09:52.741
Well, those tears seem real.

01:09:52.876 --> 01:09:56.745
How do you feel about him?

01:09:56.880 --> 01:10:00.281
After everything that
happened with Jack, it's...

01:10:02.218 --> 01:10:05.954
Honey, love requires
a leap of faith,

01:10:06.089 --> 01:10:10.224
and in my experience,
it's worth it.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:11.860
Yeah.

01:10:15.431 --> 01:10:17.065
It's going to be fine.

01:10:25.108 --> 01:10:26.507
Hi, Seth.

01:10:26.643 --> 01:10:28.309
Hey, Dad.

01:10:28.444 --> 01:10:30.045
I think you should
call this number.

01:10:30.180 --> 01:10:32.480
I don't need another client.

01:10:32.615 --> 01:10:33.982
I'm a little busy right now.

01:10:34.117 --> 01:10:35.717
He's my former handyman.

01:10:35.852 --> 01:10:36.885
Oh.

01:10:37.020 --> 01:10:38.219
To help with the house?

01:10:38.354 --> 01:10:40.321
No, he's retired.

01:10:40.456 --> 01:10:42.323
Then why would I call him?

01:10:42.458 --> 01:10:43.458
Because...

01:10:43.493 --> 01:10:44.525
he's got a sleigh.

01:10:46.129 --> 01:10:47.729
Wait, you found me a sleigh?

01:10:49.299 --> 01:10:51.165
Dad, this means everything.

01:10:51.301 --> 01:10:52.301
Uh...

01:10:52.335 --> 01:10:54.368
Uh, where's my phone?

01:11:30.261 --> 01:11:32.995
You did it.

01:11:34.999 --> 01:11:36.165
You did this for me?

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:37.820
Actually, I had a
little surprise help,

01:11:37.935 --> 01:11:39.435
but, yeah, I did it for you.

01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:43.772
M'lady.

01:11:50.148 --> 01:11:51.948
Merry Christmas.

01:11:52.083 --> 01:11:54.516
Merry Christmas.

01:12:10.568 --> 01:12:11.800
The Tour begins in two hours.

01:12:18.576 --> 01:12:19.942
- Hey!
- Hi!

01:12:20.078 --> 01:12:21.688
Got a call from Seth, said
you could use a little help.

01:12:21.712 --> 01:12:22.578
Come on in.

01:12:22.713 --> 01:12:23.857
I thought it might feel
more like the holidays

01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:24.881
with family around.

01:12:24.949 --> 01:12:25.814
Wow, nice house.

01:12:25.950 --> 01:12:26.993
Sure hope you guys have us over

01:12:27.017 --> 01:12:28.017
for Christmas dinner.

01:12:29.287 --> 01:12:30.287
I'll get it!

01:12:31.089 --> 01:12:31.887
Hi!

01:12:32.022 --> 01:12:33.089
Hi!

01:12:33.224 --> 01:12:34.968
We understand you could
use some extra hands.

01:12:34.992 --> 01:12:36.392
I'm so glad you're here.

01:12:36.527 --> 01:12:37.793
Come on in.

01:12:38.896 --> 01:12:40.229
Ooh...

01:12:40.364 --> 01:12:42.865
One more hour to go.

01:12:43.901 --> 01:12:45.934
I'm sorry, the Tour
hasn't started...

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:47.370
- Hi.
- Hi!

01:12:47.505 --> 01:12:49.038
George thought you
could use some help.

01:12:49.173 --> 01:12:50.639
- Hi, Mom.
- Sweetie.

01:12:50.774 --> 01:12:52.241
- Come on in.
- Okay.

01:12:52.376 --> 01:12:53.075
Hey.

01:12:53.211 --> 01:12:54.776
Hey, Dad...

01:12:54.912 --> 01:12:56.479
Dad? Thanks a lot.

01:12:56.614 --> 01:12:59.215
The sleigh looks great.

01:12:59.350 --> 01:13:01.384
Okay, who wants to sing
some Christmas carols?

01:13:01.519 --> 01:13:04.720
♪ Deck the halls with
boughs of holly ♪

01:13:04.855 --> 01:13:07.923
♪ Fa-la-la-la-la La-la-la-la ♪

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:11.427
Like father, like son.

01:13:20.704 --> 01:13:21.704
It's time.

01:13:23.141 --> 01:13:24.640
Guys...

01:13:24.775 --> 01:13:26.842
the Holiday Tour of Homes
has officially begun.

01:13:31.015 --> 01:13:32.314
We did it!

01:14:11.656 --> 01:14:13.222
Hmm.

01:14:16.860 --> 01:14:18.127
Hi. Ho!

01:14:19.397 --> 01:14:21.063
Stanley Malcolm,

01:14:21.199 --> 01:14:22.298
I... it's... I'm honored.

01:14:23.401 --> 01:14:24.967
Ta-da!

01:14:25.102 --> 01:14:27.035
The tree is the focal point,

01:14:27.171 --> 01:14:29.004
playing off the
contrasting shapes,

01:14:29.139 --> 01:14:31.140
like three-dimensional
modern art.

01:14:31.275 --> 01:14:32.508
I'm trying to get Christmas

01:14:32.643 --> 01:14:34.176
into the 21st Century.

01:14:34.312 --> 01:14:37.546
Well, everything
is quite striking.

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:38.914
I should be going.

01:14:39.049 --> 01:14:42.118
I have many more houses to see.

01:15:02.373 --> 01:15:04.273
Don't worry about it.
It's going to be fine.

01:15:15.185 --> 01:15:16.519
Joyce.

01:15:16.654 --> 01:15:17.953
Stanley.

01:15:18.088 --> 01:15:19.088
Every room

01:15:19.123 --> 01:15:20.389
more captivating than the next.

01:15:20.524 --> 01:15:23.058
I couldn't agree with you more.

01:15:27.231 --> 01:15:29.298
Blue spruce...

01:15:35.406 --> 01:15:37.373
Well, Layla,

01:15:37.508 --> 01:15:39.708
you've certainly transformed
Seth's investment.

01:15:39.843 --> 01:15:42.611
Still true to the
charm of the house,

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:44.780
and now it feels
like a real home.

01:15:44.915 --> 01:15:46.035
The sleigh was a nice touch.

01:15:46.083 --> 01:15:46.915
Truly inspiring.

01:15:47.050 --> 01:15:48.417
You've really done a great job.

01:15:48.552 --> 01:15:49.751
I'm very impressed.

01:15:49.887 --> 01:15:51.554
Thank you.

01:15:51.689 --> 01:15:53.489
Seth, this is the prettiest
house on the Tour.

01:15:53.591 --> 01:15:55.391
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Hardwick.

01:15:55.526 --> 01:15:56.559
I couldn't agree more.

01:15:56.694 --> 01:15:59.295
In fact, I'd like you to
come work your magic for me.

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:00.874
I've got four houses
coming on the market

01:16:00.898 --> 01:16:01.597
that need staging.

01:16:01.732 --> 01:16:02.998
Seriously?

01:16:04.468 --> 01:16:05.834
That's a dream come true.

01:16:05.969 --> 01:16:07.303
I hope to keep you very busy.

01:16:09.139 --> 01:16:10.172
Can I hug you?

01:16:10.308 --> 01:16:11.308
All right.

01:16:12.343 --> 01:16:14.343
Thank you so much, Stanley.

01:16:15.413 --> 01:16:19.448
Apparently, traditional
is still in.

01:16:19.583 --> 01:16:20.849
If you like that sort of thing.

01:16:20.984 --> 01:16:22.184
As it happens, I do.

01:16:22.320 --> 01:16:23.664
It's the feeling that
a house gives you

01:16:23.688 --> 01:16:24.886
that's most important.

01:16:25.022 --> 01:16:26.655
Modern isn't your thing?

01:16:26.791 --> 01:16:27.791
I'm afraid not.

01:16:27.825 --> 01:16:29.358
Congratulations.

01:16:29.493 --> 01:16:30.570
You two enjoy your holidays.

01:16:30.594 --> 01:16:32.361
Thank you, Stanley.

01:16:33.431 --> 01:16:34.196
Merry Christmas.

01:16:34.332 --> 01:16:35.497
Merry Christmas.

01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:38.166
I got the job.

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:39.368
Congratulations!

01:16:39.503 --> 01:16:41.803
We did it!

01:16:41.939 --> 01:16:42.939
You did it.

01:16:42.973 --> 01:16:45.241
You did it. Thank you.

01:16:46.811 --> 01:16:49.445
Mrs. Hardwick was...

01:16:49.580 --> 01:16:50.580
so happy.

01:16:51.749 --> 01:16:53.382
I mean, her charity
was a huge success.

01:16:53.517 --> 01:16:56.385
Everyone seemed to love it.

01:16:57.555 --> 01:17:01.857
You know, the longer we wait,
the harder it's going to be.

01:17:03.394 --> 01:17:05.927
It's time to break up.

01:17:07.965 --> 01:17:09.398
So, what's the plan?

01:17:09.533 --> 01:17:10.666
We'll have a fight.

01:17:10.801 --> 01:17:12.067
And then a couple days later,

01:17:12.202 --> 01:17:14.236
we'll tell everyone the
engagement is off.

01:17:15.406 --> 01:17:16.639
Okay.

01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:20.709
We could do it at dinner
with Jack and Jessica.

01:17:20.845 --> 01:17:22.478
What are we going
to fight about?

01:17:26.316 --> 01:17:28.016
We'll have to make something up.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:30.986
I got it,

01:17:31.121 --> 01:17:32.554
you hate my singing.

01:17:33.691 --> 01:17:34.723
No way, never.

01:17:34.859 --> 01:17:37.859
That's your best feature.

01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:41.764
It's got to be
something believable.

01:17:41.899 --> 01:17:44.300
How about...

01:17:44.435 --> 01:17:46.702
I work too much.

01:17:46.837 --> 01:17:48.970
That's not entirely
true anymore.

01:17:49.106 --> 01:17:51.807
What workaholic has enough
time to string popcorn?

01:17:53.176 --> 01:17:54.777
True.

01:17:54.912 --> 01:17:56.645
But...

01:17:56.781 --> 01:17:58.514
look, it's a pretty
common problem.

01:17:58.649 --> 01:18:01.116
People are gonna buy it.

01:18:01.251 --> 01:18:03.585
So I work too much...

01:18:03.721 --> 01:18:06.555
And I hardly ever see you.

01:18:06.690 --> 01:18:09.858
Then we'll just
improvise the rest.

01:18:11.161 --> 01:18:12.428
Done.

01:18:12.563 --> 01:18:14.262
Done.

01:18:16.934 --> 01:18:19.234
Uh...

01:18:19.369 --> 01:18:21.437
excuse me.

01:18:25.576 --> 01:18:27.275
Done.

01:18:30.108 --> 01:18:31.108
Shh...

01:18:37.482 --> 01:18:38.280
Okay.

01:18:38.416 --> 01:18:40.682
Okay, we leave after
the fake fight.

01:18:40.818 --> 01:18:42.818
It'll be too hard
to stick around.

01:18:42.953 --> 01:18:43.819
Okay.

01:18:43.954 --> 01:18:45.521
Okay.

01:18:47.024 --> 01:18:48.290
Surprise!

01:18:52.196 --> 01:18:53.029
Wow...

01:18:53.164 --> 01:18:55.131
We are so happy for you.

01:18:55.266 --> 01:18:58.434
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:18:58.569 --> 01:19:01.470
You are going to make
such a beautiful bride.

01:19:01.606 --> 01:19:04.106
Thanks, Dad.

01:19:04.242 --> 01:19:06.409
You sure know how to keep
a secret, don't you?

01:19:06.544 --> 01:19:08.010
Why didn't you warn me?

01:19:08.146 --> 01:19:10.079
Oh, that would have
been too easy.

01:19:13.984 --> 01:19:15.884
Here's to happily ever after!

01:19:16.020 --> 01:19:17.920
Cheers!

01:19:18.055 --> 01:19:20.489
We're so happy for you.

01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:23.259
Can I steal her for one moment?

01:19:23.394 --> 01:19:24.860
Excuse us.

01:19:31.902 --> 01:19:32.968
So what do we do now?

01:19:33.103 --> 01:19:36.472
What do we do with
everyone here?

01:19:36.607 --> 01:19:38.740
We stick to the plan.

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.712
Besides,

01:19:43.847 --> 01:19:46.415
everyone's already here.

01:19:46.551 --> 01:19:49.051
We won't have to repeat
any performances.

01:19:49.187 --> 01:19:50.018
Right.

01:19:50.154 --> 01:19:51.920
Right.

01:19:52.056 --> 01:19:55.891
So, uh, who's gonna
start the fight?

01:19:57.328 --> 01:19:58.794
I will.

01:19:58.929 --> 01:20:00.929
Okay.

01:20:07.871 --> 01:20:09.238
Hey...

01:20:09.373 --> 01:20:13.175
Hey, is everything okay?

01:20:15.145 --> 01:20:16.412
Yeah, it's...

01:20:18.249 --> 01:20:19.482
It's Seth.

01:20:21.151 --> 01:20:22.284
Look, I don't think

01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:23.830
we should be really having
this conversation right now.

01:20:23.854 --> 01:20:25.354
See, that's the problem.

01:20:25.489 --> 01:20:27.156
It's never a good time for you.

01:20:32.463 --> 01:20:33.862
No, I mean,

01:20:33.997 --> 01:20:35.998
I don't think we should
be doing this at all.

01:20:36.133 --> 01:20:38.367
What are you doing?

01:20:38.502 --> 01:20:40.436
I don't want to fight with you.

01:20:40.571 --> 01:20:42.104
Seth, it's all part of the plan.

01:20:42.240 --> 01:20:43.572
Forget the plan.

01:20:43.708 --> 01:20:45.141
I'm crazy about you.

01:20:45.276 --> 01:20:47.843
Seth, that's definitely
not part of the plan.

01:20:47.978 --> 01:20:50.546
I know,

01:20:50.681 --> 01:20:52.181
but I love you.

01:20:55.052 --> 01:20:56.418
What did you say?

01:20:56.554 --> 01:21:01.823
I'm saying that I am in
love with you, Layla.

01:21:03.994 --> 01:21:06.495
I think...

01:21:06.631 --> 01:21:08.464
I love you too.

01:21:10.268 --> 01:21:11.367
You sure?

01:21:11.502 --> 01:21:14.203
Yeah, I'm sure.

01:21:16.106 --> 01:21:17.606
I love you.

01:21:17.742 --> 01:21:19.007
That's good.

01:21:19.143 --> 01:21:21.343
Uh-huh.

01:21:21.479 --> 01:21:23.245
Okay.

01:21:26.049 --> 01:21:29.117
Well, then...

01:21:29.253 --> 01:21:30.819
one more thing.

01:21:33.824 --> 01:21:34.657
Layla O'Reilly...

01:21:34.792 --> 01:21:36.325
will you do me the honor

01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:38.427
of being my wife?

01:21:38.562 --> 01:21:40.028
Yes.

01:21:40.164 --> 01:21:41.164
Of course.

01:21:46.837 --> 01:21:48.036
Wait, wait, wait...

01:21:48.172 --> 01:21:50.606
am I missing something here?

01:21:50.741 --> 01:21:52.040
Everything!

01:21:53.511 --> 01:21:55.411
She's going to be a
December bride after all!

01:22:01.385 --> 01:22:02.418
I love you.

01:22:43.994 --> 01:22:45.694
I, Layla,

01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:49.765
take thee, Seth,

01:22:49.900 --> 01:22:51.967
to be my husband,

01:22:52.102 --> 01:22:55.036
to have and to hold

01:22:55.172 --> 01:22:57.539
for as long as we
both shall live.

01:23:00.544 --> 01:23:03.479
I, Seth, take thee, Layla,

01:23:03.614 --> 01:23:04.913
to be my December bride,

01:23:05.048 --> 01:23:07.115
to have and to hold

01:23:07.251 --> 01:23:09.752
for as long as we
both shall live.

01:23:12.690 --> 01:23:13.822
Thank you.

01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:23.732
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:23:23.868 --> 01:23:26.368
You may kiss the bride.

01:23:33.343 --> 01:23:34.343
Merry Christmas.

01:23:34.378 --> 01:23:37.279
Merry Christmas.
