WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:05.047
So according to the demonologist,
the gymnasium is clean.

00:05.339 --> 00:07.132
- We're running out of to-do stars.
- Yes.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.259
- Already dealt with.
- It's hard to believe.

00:09.551 --> 00:13.055
Somewhere along the way,
we started turning this school around.

00:16.808 --> 00:18.477
- The hell was that?
- What was what?

00:18.769 --> 00:20.145
Long, quiet lull. Don't like it.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.437
It's called contentment.

00:21.647 --> 00:23.482
Exactly.
Someone's always got a problem.

00:23.774 --> 00:27.778
I've got a problem. I don't like Abed's
problem with our lack of problems.

00:28.153 --> 00:29.446
Okay.

00:29.738 --> 00:33.325
I commented on his commentary.
I just drew a circle around Abed, baby.

00:33.617 --> 00:36.912
"I don't think it's nice to pigeonhole
people's gimmicks."

00:37.204 --> 00:38.830
"You hear me, Two-Voice?"

00:39.122 --> 00:42.125
Abed, let us have a moment
of peace and stillness.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.002
They're kind of rare around here.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.964
- Calm before the storm.
- Says the storm generator.

00:47.256 --> 00:49.132
All right, fine. Let's be content.

00:51.176 --> 00:54.388
Attention,
students and faculty of Greendale.

00:54.680 --> 00:57.266
I pressed this button on accident...

00:57.558 --> 00:59.393
but might as well check in.
How are you?

00:59.935 --> 01:01.019
Fine.

01:01.812 --> 01:03.188
That's nice. I'm good too.

01:03.939 --> 01:05.190
I love you guys.

01:05.482 --> 01:08.110
We love you too.

01:10.195 --> 01:12.030
♪ Give me some more
Time in a dream ♪

01:12.322 --> 01:15.409
♪ Give me the hope
To run out of steam ♪

01:15.701 --> 01:18.537
♪ Somebody said It can be here ♪

01:18.829 --> 01:22.749
♪ We could be roped up
Tied up dead in a year ♪

01:23.041 --> 01:27.546
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪

01:27.838 --> 01:31.800
♪ One by one they all
Just fade away ♪

01:35.721 --> 01:37.472
The information you've requested...

01:37.764 --> 01:39.766
Is on the Internet.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.394
School board, baby.

01:42.686 --> 01:44.646
School board guys coming in.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.983
I would appreciate some knocking.
Do you know what goes on in here?

01:48.275 --> 01:50.777
Heads-up. There's an insurance
appraiser coming tomorrow.

01:51.069 --> 01:54.406
Your ass is getting appraised,
insurance-style.

01:54.906 --> 01:57.492
- What does that mean?
- We hope it means we find out...

01:57.784 --> 02:00.871
that your school
is very, very valuable to the city.

02:01.163 --> 02:03.707
Hey, how hilarious would that be?

02:04.333 --> 02:05.584
Are you guys drunk?

02:05.876 --> 02:08.586
- Good luck proving it before we're not.
- Yeah.

02:11.173 --> 02:12.674
Pa-pa-papaya.

02:13.800 --> 02:14.843
Mango.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.095
Strawberry.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.099
- Too ripe.
- You've been doing this for 30 minutes.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.519
So what?
I made all the vegetables disappear.

02:24.811 --> 02:26.772
A lot more than this happens
in 30 minutes.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.358
- We're relaxed and happy.
- I care more about this...

02:29.650 --> 02:32.861
- than anything I've ever cared about.
- Best $199 I've ever spent.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.279
It's 3 dollars.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.114
What are you playing?

02:36.406 --> 02:41.119
That's control software
for some kind of irrigation equipment.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.121
It's fun.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.123
Save Greendale Committee, unite.

02:45.499 --> 02:47.417
An insurance appraiser
is coming tomorrow...

02:47.709 --> 02:50.295
to inspect the school.
If he doesn't appraise us good...

02:50.587 --> 02:52.130
the school is doomed, doomed.

02:52.422 --> 02:55.634
- Call to adventure. Call to adventure.
- What's an insurance appraiser?

02:55.926 --> 02:58.303
Something that sounds normal
and boring but is scary.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.430
Like a raised mole
or a turkey deep fryer.

03:00.722 --> 03:02.933
Only one man qualified
to appraise insurance...

03:03.225 --> 03:04.976
and he died 2000 years ago
on a cross.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.938
I've seen insurance appraisers bleed.

03:08.230 --> 03:11.274
Their blood's different, darker.

03:11.566 --> 03:12.776
Everyone, take a breath.

03:13.068 --> 03:16.488
You're overreacting because this school
is addicted to crisis.

03:16.780 --> 03:20.158
You're like Hurricane Katrina dogs
that won't let anyone pet them anymore.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.495
But the weird thing
we need to get used to is this:

03:23.787 --> 03:25.080
The school's in decent shape.

03:25.372 --> 03:27.624
This doesn't have to be a big deal.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.960
I wrote a paper on those dogs.

03:32.587 --> 03:36.174
We've worked hard all semester
to save this school.

03:36.466 --> 03:38.844
Truth is, we did.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.136
So relax.

03:40.345 --> 03:42.347
- Are you sure, Jeffrey?
- I promise.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.319
Heart's in the right place,
but he's wrong.

03:44.599 --> 03:47.602
Greendale is a crazy place where
crazy things happen. I have a plan.

03:47.894 --> 03:49.855
Pretend we have a renowned
Physics Department.

03:50.147 --> 03:52.691
- Dean, start learning Swedish.
- I'll do my best.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.402
Hickey, you keep in touch
with any criminals you busted?

03:55.694 --> 03:57.487
- Five.
- Get them for costume measurements.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.198
We need to make a particle accelerator
out of boxes.

04:00.490 --> 04:02.868
Nope. Nobody do any of that.
Abed, outside.

04:06.788 --> 04:08.874
- There is no story.
- Everything's a story, Jeff.

04:09.166 --> 04:11.209
Getting out of bed is a story.
This is a story.

04:11.501 --> 04:14.254
Study room, we're content.
I'm concerned. Skip fruit-matching.

04:14.546 --> 04:16.298
Dean enters with the insurance story.

04:16.589 --> 04:17.589
Call, refusal.

04:17.798 --> 04:20.594
You're dragging me across a threshold
demanding there be no story.

04:20.886 --> 04:23.054
Puts me into a world
I'm gonna have to adapt to.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.056
You have to do it by yourself, please.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.392
Okay?
Because if this appraisal is a story...

04:27.684 --> 04:30.228
that means we're in trouble,
and we are not in trouble.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.646
Because if we are...

04:33.023 --> 04:34.023
No more stories.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.361
So we'll see you later.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.071
After no story.

04:40.363 --> 04:41.823
No story.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.035
So be it.

04:45.327 --> 04:47.662
Let the lack of story...

04:49.000 --> 04:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:06.681 --> 05:08.058
Hey.

05:08.350 --> 05:10.268
Oh, put one trap behind each cabinet.

05:10.560 --> 05:13.230
Although, I think we're good.
The cafeteria food killed...

05:13.522 --> 05:16.525
- most of the roaches anyway.
- Hey, check it out.

05:16.900 --> 05:20.445
- Is this a wedding ring?
- Are you kidding? What...?

05:21.988 --> 05:24.032
I lost this my first week here.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.618
Oh, who's the lucky...?

05:27.619 --> 05:29.704
It's my mom's.
I started wearing it because...

05:29.996 --> 05:33.458
I don't know, everybody dreams
of settling down, right?

05:34.960 --> 05:37.712
And because it fits.
She had huge fingers for a woman.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.006
Part of what killed her, really.

05:40.715 --> 05:42.384
I'm not dreaming about settling down.

05:42.676 --> 05:45.762
Well, maybe you already have.
You're teaching, and you like it.

05:46.054 --> 05:49.182
- You love Greendale.
- No, I love Scotch and myself.

05:49.474 --> 05:50.976
I tolerate Greendale.

05:51.268 --> 05:53.687
It's a good school.
There's no need to get sentimental.

05:53.979 --> 05:56.648
This is going to be
the most boring thing to happen here...

05:56.940 --> 05:59.150
since Britta dated Troy.

05:59.442 --> 06:01.403
All right, no story.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.071
Wait.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.448
If there's no story,
what am I explaining?

06:05.740 --> 06:07.534
I'm in a story.

06:08.243 --> 06:09.828
Okay, think, Abed, think.

06:10.120 --> 06:12.247
How do you shake a story?

06:13.915 --> 06:18.003
The answer is in the teacher's lounge.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.969
Oh, hey, Janelle, how are you?

06:30.140 --> 06:31.850
- Here he comes, here he comes.
- Okay.

06:33.935 --> 06:36.646
Hi, my name is Ronald Mohammed.
Go ahead, heard them all.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.815
The city of Greendale
has sent me here...

06:39.107 --> 06:41.902
to assess
this campus's level of liability.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.862
Now, what do I mean by liability?

06:44.154 --> 06:47.032
Well, the city defines liability
as any asserted...

06:47.324 --> 06:50.911
or non-asserted perturbation
by any qualifying party.

06:51.202 --> 06:54.372
What's a party? A party is a person
or a group of persons...

06:54.664 --> 06:58.543
or an event celebrating a person
or a party of persons' birth, marriage...

06:58.835 --> 07:00.128
Don't panic, Jeffrey.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.798
I'm fine.
I'm the only one who's not panicking.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.384
Please. You can lie to yourself,
but don't lie to me.

07:06.676 --> 07:08.678
But the city defines a dog...

07:08.970 --> 07:11.723
as any living entity
with four legs and a tail.

07:12.015 --> 07:13.683
So raccoons, bears...

07:14.142 --> 07:17.729
mountain lions, mice,
these are all just different sizes of dog.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.105
What do I mean by size?

07:19.397 --> 07:21.566
- Tell you a story.
- What's that supposed to mean?

07:21.858 --> 07:23.985
I know how much you feel
for the campus, Jeff.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.528
How much you feel in general.

07:25.820 --> 07:29.324
And I know you think it's a weakness,
but believe me, it's your strength.

07:29.616 --> 07:32.577
- You got something in your teeth.
- You got something in your chest.

07:32.869 --> 07:36.581
Four hundred thousand gallons
of liquefied horse meat.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.085
Here I come.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.930
Just...

07:53.598 --> 07:57.060
And you shall find that salt is the taste
of another man's bread...

07:57.352 --> 08:00.522
and hard is the way up and down
another man's stairs.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.357
Dante. Let's proceed.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.164
No! It's always a story.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.291
Everything is a story.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.263
Wait, wait, wait. Story feeds on conflict.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.463
If I stop resisting,
it'll stop being a story.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.049
No, Abed.

08:29.551 --> 08:30.551
Me with a beard?

08:30.802 --> 08:31.845
Keep fighting the story.

08:32.136 --> 08:34.264
Keep fighting it until it falls apart.

08:34.556 --> 08:35.807
I'm right.

08:37.392 --> 08:40.311
I mean, I'm wrong.
I mean, I'm right. I mean, I'm wrong.

08:40.602 --> 08:42.813
I mean, I'm right. I mean, I'm wrong.

08:43.106 --> 08:44.691
I mean, I'm right. I mean, I'm wrong.

08:44.983 --> 08:47.444
Unsubscribe.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.529
For the final stage of my appraisal...

08:49.821 --> 08:52.490
I'm gonna randomly select
one of your vending machines...

08:52.782 --> 08:55.076
to see if it can be rocked
using human strength...

08:55.368 --> 08:56.745
enough to tip and crush me.

08:57.120 --> 08:58.496
Now, in the U.S., each year...

08:58.788 --> 09:00.040
six people die this way...

09:00.331 --> 09:02.333
and five of them
are insurance appraisers...

09:02.625 --> 09:05.003
so I take this very seriously.
Here we go.

09:20.268 --> 09:22.520
- Okay.
- Sorry we're late.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.773
Hey, look. It's Ronald Mohammed.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.149
How about that name?

09:27.692 --> 09:29.152
All right, what's the damage?

09:29.444 --> 09:33.031
How much is this scampy little hole
in the earth gonna cost us this year?

09:33.323 --> 09:37.660
Well, your gas leak is repaired, all
your fire exits actually lead outside...

09:37.952 --> 09:41.664
and I am told that no new species
have been discovered here in a week.

09:41.956 --> 09:45.210
I have to say, I was brought in here
to estimate Greendale's liability...

09:45.502 --> 09:49.214
but at this point in time, I'd describe
this campus as an actual property asset.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.885
This property has value.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.554
Oh, yeah!

09:57.055 --> 09:59.182
Best news ever.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.398
- This property has value.
- It has value.

10:07.690 --> 10:10.026
- That means we can sell it.
- We can finally sell it.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.569
Wait, wait, wait.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.571
Press stop on Dave Matthews.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.908
- What?
- We can start courting businesses...

10:17.200 --> 10:19.244
to unload this school
on the private sector.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.537
What do you mean?

10:20.829 --> 10:23.915
This is a huge chunk of real estate,
which generates no tax revenue...

10:24.207 --> 10:26.501
and takes money
from the Education budget.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.586
That's because
it's a community college.

10:28.878 --> 10:32.423
Well, excuse us for taking longer
to see that was the problem.

10:32.715 --> 10:34.467
Maybe we're not as smart as you.

10:34.759 --> 10:36.344
I mean, we only went to Yale.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.263
Oh, no, you didn't.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.432
- Yes, I did.
- We should call T.J.Maxx right away.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.601
Dude, I told you. This jacket looks fine.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.979
No, to talk about selling this place.

10:46.271 --> 10:49.482
Oh, right. Yeah, T.J.Maxx, Marshalls.
What about Ben & Jerry's?

10:49.774 --> 10:53.653
Oh, Richie, you're my friend,
but that is the last thing you need.

10:53.945 --> 10:56.114
Tough love received, bro.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.911
I did it. This school is story-free.
We can be content now forever.

11:09.294 --> 11:11.629
Let me be one of the six this year.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.216
Craig. Craig, this vending machine
is not gonna tip over and crush you.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.968
Why not? Why?

11:17.260 --> 11:21.222
Because we fixed it
when we saved Greendale.

11:26.060 --> 11:28.313
We saved Greendale.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.150
And now they're gonna sell it.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.204
If I come over there...

11:45.455 --> 11:49.500
there are gonna be two sounds:
Me hitting you twice.

11:54.505 --> 11:57.842
Hello, Greendale, as you know,
our school will soon be replaced...

11:58.134 --> 11:59.344
by a sandwich university.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.930
However,
every ending is also a beginning.

12:03.389 --> 12:05.183
Sure, things may look bad now...

12:05.475 --> 12:09.229
some of us may have no idea
where we're going or what to do, but...

12:10.688 --> 12:12.649
Okay, okay,
I should've written this out.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.693
I thought I'd be able to come up
with something on the fly.

12:15.985 --> 12:21.616
Moving on to phase two,
the actual saving of Greendale.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.283
Annie...

12:23.534 --> 12:26.329
I've generated a few ideas
involving social media...

12:26.621 --> 12:29.499
- that I think might do the trick.
- Annie...

12:29.791 --> 12:32.794
You want us to tweet "Savegreendale"?
I'm sorry, Annie.

12:33.086 --> 12:36.381
The reason I have 48 followers
is that I don't exploit them.

12:36.673 --> 12:39.425
They come to me for atheistic rants
and photos of my meals...

12:39.717 --> 12:41.386
not this obnoxiousness.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.973
We need to make people aware
that Greendale exists and needs help.

12:45.265 --> 12:47.141
- Why?
- Because once the Internet...

12:47.433 --> 12:49.811
- knows about something, it changes.
- Right.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.980
Just ask Chris Brown or China.

12:54.399 --> 12:56.067
Jeff, you made Annie cry.

12:56.359 --> 13:00.613
Well, if it's any consolation, this is
the last time that will ever happen.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.033
I know how to save Greendale.

13:04.325 --> 13:07.078
Treasure. Buried treasure.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.329
Okay, I'm tapped.

13:10.581 --> 13:14.919
We all wish we could do something,
Annie, but I think that concludes...

13:15.211 --> 13:18.589
the last meeting
of the Save Greendale Committee...

13:19.007 --> 13:21.175
the committee that did its darnedest.

13:21.467 --> 13:24.762
Wait! Are we sure we can't stop
the school from being sold to Subway?

13:25.054 --> 13:26.097
I'm afraid so, Chang.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.600
Okay, I just wanted to make sure.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.647
Screw you, guys. It's time to get paid.

13:45.825 --> 13:49.912
Chang just unexpectedly
betrayed the group for the last time.

13:54.542 --> 13:57.170
Greendale's gonna make
a great Subway Sandwich University.

13:57.462 --> 13:59.172
Research shows
most of your graduates...

13:59.464 --> 14:03.760
- end up working for our restaurants.
- By design. We're proud of our school.

14:04.052 --> 14:05.094
Proud of Subway School.

14:05.386 --> 14:06.804
This campus is yours now.

14:07.096 --> 14:10.600
If you wanna dynamite it, all we ask
is that you let us light the fuse.

14:10.892 --> 14:12.477
Yeah, we hate this place.

14:12.769 --> 14:15.521
- You just said you were proud of it.
- Proud of its potential.

14:15.813 --> 14:16.939
Love its potential.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.359
This'll be your office.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.488
Why?

14:23.946 --> 14:26.741
Okay, we'll check in on that later.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.327
What, can't wait
until Greendale's corpse is cold...

14:29.619 --> 14:31.496
before you put it
on a 6-inch white bun?

14:31.788 --> 14:33.164
Young lady, that's not fair.

14:33.456 --> 14:36.209
Subway doesn't call its bread "buns,"
and we don't serve white.

14:36.501 --> 14:37.877
We serve Italian, honey oat...

14:38.169 --> 14:40.713
- nine-grain wheat.
- Thanks for making my joke accurate.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.132
- Now it's hilarious.
- Classes are over, kids.

14:43.424 --> 14:44.759
We're helping the dean pack.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.928
This is still Greendale for two hours.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.220
Enjoy it.

14:51.682 --> 14:55.019
Wait. You don't call your bread "buns."
What do you call them?

14:55.561 --> 14:56.561
Bread.

14:57.772 --> 15:01.275
Bread is a substance. What do you call
the units of bread you use, "breads"?

15:07.615 --> 15:08.866
You okay?

15:09.158 --> 15:10.326
I just wish we had more time.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.870
I could turn things around, I swear.
Look.

15:13.371 --> 15:17.375
I got one of these label things.
I mean, it makes custom labels.

15:18.668 --> 15:22.505
This was gonna help me
get organised.

15:26.050 --> 15:28.219
Where should we start?
Pack up these pictures?

15:28.511 --> 15:30.304
They're not really mine.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.723
They're Greendale history.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.560
Here's our 1987 civil rights march.

15:35.852 --> 15:39.313
This was when we started offering
Photoshop classes.

15:39.605 --> 15:42.233
And that's Russell Borchert.

15:42.984 --> 15:44.902
Borchert, Borchert, loved computers...

15:45.194 --> 15:49.198
Yes, yes, "More than women's butts
or hooters." Very mature, you two.

15:49.991 --> 15:51.617
Was there any truth to that legend?

15:51.909 --> 15:54.203
The legend
that a Greendale computer professor...

15:54.495 --> 15:55.913
made love to a computer...

15:56.205 --> 15:58.666
and died of the first computer virus?
Sure.

15:58.958 --> 16:02.211
The truth is,
Greendale had a computer professor.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.630
By the way,
he was a millionaire and a genius.

16:04.922 --> 16:08.217
He has sex with one computer,
and that's his legacy?

16:08.509 --> 16:10.928
So after all my work,
how will I be remembered?

16:11.220 --> 16:13.514
The bald dean with glasses, I guess.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.017
You aware
there's an engraved plate on this, says:

16:16.309 --> 16:19.270
- "The truth is behind this picture"?
- Of course. I'm not an idiot.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.898
Whoa, wait. It meant literally?

16:22.190 --> 16:23.608
What is it?

16:37.038 --> 16:38.706
You were teaching
Fundamentals of Law?

16:38.998 --> 16:39.998
Yeah.

16:40.208 --> 16:43.753
Think you could make the transition
to teaching Sandwich Law?

16:44.045 --> 16:47.548
It's essentially the same, I'm sure,
just a bit more focused.

16:48.424 --> 16:49.717
Here.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.385
That's a Subway black card.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.639
It entitles you to
5-dollar footlongs for life.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.308
For life, Mr. Winger.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.644
For life.

17:14.407 --> 17:16.285
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:18.329 --> 17:21.249
So, what are you gonna do?

17:21.540 --> 17:23.667
I'm thinking I'm gonna transfer
to city college...

17:23.960 --> 17:26.127
but I'm knowing
I'm gonna be a bartender.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.505
You?

17:27.797 --> 17:30.299
- Subway offered me a job.
- Nice.

17:31.926 --> 17:35.137
I'm worried about Abed and Annie.
They're not ready for this to end.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.765
They're part of the
adulthood-begins-at-30 generation.

17:38.057 --> 17:39.350
And I'm...

17:39.642 --> 17:41.769
I'm actually looking forward
to a little bit of...

17:42.061 --> 17:44.021
- Sanity?
- Yes. Sanity.

17:44.313 --> 17:47.858
Yeah. I mean, it's over,
but on the other hand, it's over.

17:48.150 --> 17:52.321
Amen. And to think this all started
because you wanted to...

17:52.613 --> 17:53.613
Nail you.

17:53.823 --> 17:55.283
Yeah, I regret nothing.

17:55.575 --> 17:58.828
Don't. I mean, after everything
that has happened here...

17:59.120 --> 18:02.957
what did either of us
really get done aside from each other?

18:03.249 --> 18:08.170
Exactly. And what are either of us
gonna be leaving with?

18:15.469 --> 18:20.641
I should go clean out my locker,
she said at the age of 33.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.520
Let's get married.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.440
- What?
- Yeah, right?

18:27.732 --> 18:30.401
I mean, this is what matters, isn't it?

18:30.693 --> 18:32.903
This is what keeps this all
from being pointless.

18:33.195 --> 18:36.741
Let's do what people do. Get a house we
can't afford, a dog that makes us angry.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.076
Dedicate an entire cabinet
to grocery bags...

18:39.368 --> 18:41.537
realise we have a favourite brand
of olive oil?

18:41.829 --> 18:43.039
Yes. Marry me.

18:43.331 --> 18:45.249
Okay, yeah.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.505
Yeah. Yeah, this feels right.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.383
Let's get out of here
and never look back.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.011
First, let's lock these doors
and pull these shades.

18:57.303 --> 19:00.890
- We've never had sex on the new table.
- Yes, two for two.

19:01.515 --> 19:03.351
Medium roughness, high tempo?

19:03.643 --> 19:05.061
Let's make it a number eight.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.275
Buried treasure!

19:11.567 --> 19:14.236
Buried treasure!
Lock the doors, close the blinds.

19:15.029 --> 19:18.115
We could save Greendale, Jeff.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.911
There may be treasure on campus.

19:22.203 --> 19:23.913
Hidden, buried treasure.

19:24.205 --> 19:26.499
Treasure!
We need to call an emergency meeting...

19:26.791 --> 19:28.959
somewhere safe
where no one can hear or see...

19:29.251 --> 19:31.212
because we have to
keep this a secret...

19:31.504 --> 19:36.384
because it's a buried treasure!

19:36.676 --> 19:37.968
Buried treasure!

19:38.260 --> 19:42.765
Buried treasure,
buried treasure, buried treasure.

19:43.057 --> 19:45.935
Buried treasure, buried treasure,
buried treasure.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.562
Buried treasure, buried treasure.

19:48.854 --> 19:49.854
Interesting.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.234
Emergency meeting.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.366
And that's how
I ended up at Greendale.

20:00.658 --> 20:03.160
Isn't it strange how it took
this school shutting down...

20:03.452 --> 20:05.162
for you and I to know each other?

20:05.454 --> 20:07.081
- What's up next for you?
- Don't know.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.750
Maybe go stay with family
in Lincolnshire.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.335
- Lincolnshire?
- Yeah.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.755
- Where in Lincolnshire?
- Just a little town called Scunthorpe.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.508
Scunthorpe?
I was stationed around Scunthorpe.

20:17.800 --> 20:18.801
- No.
- Oh, wait, wait.

20:19.719 --> 20:23.681
O'er the lady's smocks I tarry.

20:23.973 --> 20:26.517
Through the hollyhocks and glen.

20:26.809 --> 20:29.645
For a piss and a thrush
In Scunthorpe.

20:29.937 --> 20:32.857
- Then it's off to Henningpen.
- Then it's off to Henningpen.

20:33.691 --> 20:34.859
I love that.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.528
Oh, where in God's name
did you learn that song?

20:37.820 --> 20:40.030
- In Stainsbury Pub.
- My family practically lived...

20:40.322 --> 20:43.033
- in Stainsbury's.
- I lost my virginity at Stainsbury's.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.369
My mother was a Stainsbury whore.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.128
Mine was missing a thumb.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.505
Oh, my God.

20:58.966 --> 21:00.718
- Two thumbs, she got both.
- Two thumbs.

21:01.010 --> 21:05.264
I mean,
you may have slept with my aunt...

21:05.556 --> 21:08.142
but given the circumstances, cheers.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.060
- Cheers, yeah.
- Yeah.

21:11.145 --> 21:14.565
So you're gonna stay with your family
till you get your bearings?

21:14.857 --> 21:17.818
I've got a cousin, Clive,
who's got a spare room.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.029
- You and he would really get along.
- Really?

21:20.321 --> 21:21.614
Yeah.
