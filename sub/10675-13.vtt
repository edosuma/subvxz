00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:16.397 --> 00:18.519
Chase, why are you lurking?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.191
Do you not have
anything better to do?

00:20.191 --> 00:22.523
Would I be reading
your private emails

00:22.523 --> 00:24.145
if I had anything
better to do?

00:26.357 --> 00:28.779
By the way, typo,
third line down.

00:30.911 --> 00:33.454
Hey Bree, want to
get a frozen yogurt?

00:33.454 --> 00:35.496
Absolutely.

00:35.496 --> 00:37.868
She was talking to me.

00:37.868 --> 00:39.370
Why can't I go, too?

00:39.370 --> 00:42.583
Because you'll make us
get sugar-free.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.337
Why are you being so needy?

00:46.337 --> 00:48.969
Ever since I stopped being
mission leader,

00:48.969 --> 00:50.551
I've been so bored.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.093
It's amazing how much time
you have on your hands

00:52.093 --> 00:54.805
when you're not telling
everyone else what to do.

00:54.805 --> 00:56.387
Maybe you need a hobby.

00:56.387 --> 00:58.139
What do you
enjoy doing?

00:58.139 --> 01:01.772
Telling everyone else
what to do.

01:02.983 --> 01:04.485
Later, Chase.

01:06.607 --> 01:08.949
Hey, guys, what
are you up to?

01:08.949 --> 01:10.951
Watching football.

01:10.951 --> 01:14.575
Our fantasy teams are going
head-to-head today. Epic!

01:14.575 --> 01:16.117
Epic!

01:16.117 --> 01:17.788
I like epic!

01:20.331 --> 01:22.333
Oh, uh...

01:22.333 --> 01:24.004
Yeah, no offense, Chase,

01:24.004 --> 01:26.837
but, uh, this is
kinda like our tradition.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.799
Between us.

01:28.799 --> 01:30.711
Him and me.

01:31.802 --> 01:33.424
Gotcha.

01:33.424 --> 01:34.765
So how do we play?

01:36.887 --> 01:39.019
Fantasy football
isn't really played.

01:39.019 --> 01:40.931
The players' stats are
given a point value--

01:40.931 --> 01:42.813
This looks like math.

01:42.813 --> 01:44.985
What? Where?
Get it off!

01:44.985 --> 01:48.819
If I'm right,
and I always am,

01:48.819 --> 01:50.941
you take the statistics
and probabilities

01:50.941 --> 01:52.443
of the players
based on previous numbers

01:52.443 --> 01:54.034
and extrapolate
the outcomes.

01:54.034 --> 01:56.407
No, you don't.

01:56.407 --> 01:58.118
You see how well
they played before,

01:58.118 --> 02:00.831
then pick them
based off of that.

02:03.003 --> 02:05.296
All right, but according
to my formula,

02:05.296 --> 02:07.708
you should've started
this guy,

02:07.708 --> 02:09.089
'cause he's gonna score
right about...

02:09.089 --> 02:10.841
( crowd cheering
on TV)

02:10.841 --> 02:12.343
Now.

02:13.844 --> 02:15.756
You're a football genius.

02:17.057 --> 02:19.180
- Epic!
- Epic!

02:20.471 --> 02:22.683
I like epic.

03:11.522 --> 03:13.694
Kaz, where have you been?

03:13.694 --> 03:16.407
We were supposed to see
the movie three hours ago.

03:16.407 --> 03:19.199
Oh, right, the movie.
Didn't you get my text?

03:19.199 --> 03:21.582
No. The last text
you sent me

03:21.582 --> 03:23.584
is a picture of
your inner elbow

03:23.584 --> 03:24.875
that looks like a butt.

03:24.875 --> 03:27.748
It must've been
before that.

03:27.748 --> 03:31.672
Nope. Just a picture of
your knee butt, shoulder butt,

03:31.672 --> 03:35.095
and what I'm hoping
is your toe butt.

03:35.095 --> 03:38.138
Okay, you caught me.
I forgot

03:38.138 --> 03:41.141
Dude, we've had plans
to see this movie for weeks.

03:41.141 --> 03:43.554
Uh, it's my fault.

03:43.554 --> 03:45.606
Kaz and I have been
hanging out all day.

03:46.807 --> 03:49.109
Yeah, ever since Chase
stopped being mission leader,

03:49.109 --> 03:51.402
he's a lot more fun.

03:51.402 --> 03:53.354
I really am.

03:54.655 --> 03:56.987
This guy?

03:56.987 --> 03:59.029
Tightwad McSciencehead?

04:01.161 --> 04:04.204
Yeah. So we found out
about a drone race

04:04.204 --> 04:06.457
they're having in
the park this weekend,

04:06.457 --> 04:10.421
so we entered, and now,
we are building our own drone.

04:10.421 --> 04:12.212
Well, what about me?

04:12.212 --> 04:14.174
Did you ever think
I'd like to build a drone?

04:14.174 --> 04:17.758
- You can help us--
- I don't wanna build a drone!

04:17.758 --> 04:21.011
I can't believe
you ditched me.

04:21.011 --> 04:23.013
I'm sorry.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.185
We'll go see
the movie tomorrow, okay?

04:25.185 --> 04:27.017
Just help us
build the drone.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.520
Fine.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.563
So what movie were
you two gonna see anyway?

04:32.563 --> 04:35.065
Oh, The King of Diamonds.

04:35.065 --> 04:37.067
Oh, don't waste your time.

04:37.067 --> 04:38.819
Kaz and I already saw it
this afternoon...

04:40.160 --> 04:44.405
You know, I'd like to see
that elbow butt.

04:49.540 --> 04:53.374
Oh boy, did I deserve to be
locked away for that one.

04:55.045 --> 04:57.007
'Sup, chicas?

04:57.007 --> 04:59.089
Perry, how did you
get in here?

04:59.089 --> 05:01.181
You'd be surprised
the places you can go

05:01.181 --> 05:02.843
through an air
conditioning duct.

05:04.685 --> 05:06.226
What are you looking at?

05:06.226 --> 05:08.058
My old family
photo albums.

05:08.058 --> 05:10.851
Decided to dust 'em off now that
I'm back in my hometown.

05:10.851 --> 05:13.023
Who's this on
the tightrope?

05:13.023 --> 05:14.645
Aunt Barbara.

05:14.645 --> 05:16.106
This may surprise you,

05:16.106 --> 05:17.818
but we Perry
are circus folk.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.700
You don't say?

05:21.492 --> 05:23.033
It's true.

05:23.033 --> 05:25.446
The women in my family
were all talented wire walkers.

05:25.446 --> 05:27.287
I come from a long
line of 'em. Look.

05:29.620 --> 05:31.502
That's so cool.

05:31.502 --> 05:33.253
Yeah, but they all fell

05:33.253 --> 05:35.215
attempting the hardest
walk of all--

05:35.215 --> 05:37.217
between two skyscrapers.

05:37.217 --> 05:40.220
Well, technically,
my grandma Gertie didn't fall.

05:40.220 --> 05:42.012
She was pushed
by Granpa George.

05:44.134 --> 05:46.517
All the women in my family
were trailblazers,

05:46.517 --> 05:49.730
but I've never done
anything that mattered.

05:49.730 --> 05:52.102
Come on,
that can't be true.

05:52.102 --> 05:54.395
It is.
You wouldn't understand

05:54.395 --> 05:56.737
because you have
all these amazing powers.

05:56.737 --> 06:01.031
And you, you know what kind of
amazing powers Skylar has.

06:03.113 --> 06:06.617
You know what?
I'm gonna do it.

06:06.617 --> 06:08.869
I'm gonna finish the walk.

06:08.869 --> 06:10.250
Yes. I love it.

06:10.250 --> 06:11.992
No, you don't.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.587
This is probably
the worst idea you've ever had,

06:16.587 --> 06:18.799
and you have had a lot
of very bad ideas.

06:18.799 --> 06:21.712
I know, but this is
one of my best bad ideas.

06:21.712 --> 06:23.804
All I have to do is walk,
and I've been doing that

06:23.804 --> 06:25.716
since I was eight.

06:25.716 --> 06:29.139
Not on a high wire
between two skyscrapers.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.932
Trust me, this will
not end well.

06:31.932 --> 06:34.104
You do not have
what it takes.

06:34.104 --> 06:36.226
Yes, I do.
And you know what?
I'm gonna prove it to you.

06:36.226 --> 06:37.898
I'm gonna go online
right now and find

06:37.898 --> 06:40.110
the cheapest tightrope
money can buy.

06:44.194 --> 06:46.196
Okay, the base
of the drone is ready.

06:46.196 --> 06:47.788
Now we just gotta
soup her up

06:47.788 --> 06:49.950
so she can annihilate
the competition

06:49.950 --> 06:53.744
I was not aware that
the drone was a "she."

06:53.744 --> 06:56.667
Everything I create
is a "she."

06:56.667 --> 06:59.129
Isn't that right, Linda?

07:02.302 --> 07:04.635
I'm just excited
to build the drone.

07:04.635 --> 07:07.678
Oh, I say we add
a confetti cannon,

07:07.678 --> 07:09.850
and since she's a lady,

07:09.850 --> 07:13.053
we paint her
a nice candy apple red,

07:13.053 --> 07:16.396
and add a cute
little smile on the front.

07:16.396 --> 07:19.229
Kaz, you can't be serious.

07:19.229 --> 07:21.151
Those are terrible ideas.

07:21.151 --> 07:23.403
Well, Chase
doesn't think so.

07:23.403 --> 07:25.275
Right, Chase?

07:25.275 --> 07:27.778
Uh... no.
Not at all.

07:27.778 --> 07:30.120
I think those
are great ideas.

07:31.782 --> 07:34.535
See? Oh, I was
also thinking

07:34.535 --> 07:36.997
that we should add
tinted windows,

07:36.997 --> 07:39.459
skis in case of
a water landing,

07:39.459 --> 07:42.042
and a little speaker
that plays mariachi music

07:42.042 --> 07:44.845
so we can call her
La Drona.

07:44.845 --> 07:48.679
Or how about we just
call her La Lame-o?

07:50.591 --> 07:51.802
You know what?

07:51.802 --> 07:53.934
Ever since we invited you in,

07:53.934 --> 07:55.936
all you've done
is bash my ideas

07:55.936 --> 07:57.808
and made me feel stupid.

07:57.808 --> 08:00.360
Kaz, I'm not saying
your ideas are stupid.

08:00.360 --> 08:02.062
I'm saying they're wrong.

08:02.062 --> 08:04.735
You know what?

08:04.735 --> 08:07.908
If you can't be more
supportive like Chase,

08:07.908 --> 08:10.110
then I don't think
you should be working with us.

08:13.954 --> 08:16.036
And if you're not gonna leave

08:16.036 --> 08:18.078
after this uncomfortable
exchange, I will.

08:23.383 --> 08:25.425
What's up with you?

08:25.425 --> 08:27.427
First you steal Skylar
by getting her powers back,

08:27.427 --> 08:28.719
now you're trying
to steal my best friend.

08:28.719 --> 08:30.300
You know his ideas
are lame.

08:30.300 --> 08:32.262
Of course they are.

08:32.262 --> 08:34.434
And the old Chase
would've told him
he was wrong,

08:34.434 --> 08:36.727
and made him feel
intellecutally inferior.

08:36.727 --> 08:39.479
But the new Chase
is a butt-kissing yes man.

08:41.441 --> 08:43.814
So I'm agreeing with
Kaz' ideas for now,

08:43.814 --> 08:45.856
but right before the race,
I'll rebuild the drone

08:45.856 --> 08:47.487
to look the way I want it.

08:47.487 --> 08:49.149
So you're still being
a control freak;

08:49.149 --> 08:51.111
just not to his face.

08:51.111 --> 08:53.864
Exactly. Baby steps.

08:58.328 --> 09:01.832
Okay, tightrope is secured
to the roof.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.423
At least I hope it is.

09:03.423 --> 09:05.295
I've neve secured
a tightrope before, so...

09:07.297 --> 09:11.221
By the way,
love the outfit.

09:13.724 --> 09:17.768
Thanks. I stole it
off a sleeping clown.

09:17.768 --> 09:21.141
I'm gonna get my phone
so I can take pics for
your photo album.

09:25.025 --> 09:27.147
What is that?

09:27.147 --> 09:31.111
That is a gently used
$16 tightrope.

09:31.111 --> 09:33.864
So you're really
gonna go through with this?

09:33.864 --> 09:35.325
You haven't even
practiced.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.576
I practiced.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.749
I just walked here
from my apartment.

09:38.749 --> 09:41.411
I only fell twice.

09:41.411 --> 09:45.465
Okay, Perry,
listen to me.

09:45.465 --> 09:48.508
If you do this,
you're gonna die.

09:48.508 --> 09:51.511
And for some reason,
that actually upsets me.

09:51.511 --> 09:54.514
I get it.
You're obsessed with me.

09:54.514 --> 09:56.596
You don't have to be
so creepy about it. Eww.

09:58.929 --> 10:01.722
All I have to do
is walk to the other
side and back.

10:01.722 --> 10:04.484
Before you know it,
I'll be the pride of
the Perry family.

10:04.484 --> 10:06.526
You're so brave.

10:06.526 --> 10:08.528
Tell me something
I don't know.

10:08.528 --> 10:10.110
I have microscopic vision,

10:10.110 --> 10:11.571
and there is an alarming
amount of insects

10:11.571 --> 10:13.573
living in your hair.

10:13.573 --> 10:16.737
Again, tell me something
I don't know.

10:22.412 --> 10:24.544
Hey.

10:24.544 --> 10:26.797
I wanted to apologize
for earlier.

10:26.797 --> 10:29.209
I never should have
shot down your ideas.

10:29.209 --> 10:30.550
I'm sorry.

10:30.550 --> 10:32.382
All right.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.464
Apology accepted.

10:34.464 --> 10:37.347
Really? Just like that?

10:37.347 --> 10:40.100
I was prepared to
fake cry and talk about

10:40.100 --> 10:42.933
how we've been
best friends for years.

10:42.933 --> 10:46.356
Oh, no,
it's really happening.

10:47.978 --> 10:49.439
Here come the tears.

10:51.361 --> 10:53.864
Oliver, please don't
drip on La Drona.

10:56.777 --> 10:59.579
Right. Now that
we're friends again,

10:59.579 --> 11:02.082
there's something
you need to know.

11:02.082 --> 11:04.284
Chase is placating you.

11:04.284 --> 11:06.747
( scoffs )
No, he's not.

11:07.878 --> 11:09.750
What's placating mean?

11:11.211 --> 11:13.253
It means he's telling you
your ideas are good,

11:13.253 --> 11:15.555
but before the race,
he's gonna undo them all.

11:15.555 --> 11:17.928
I don't believe you.

11:17.928 --> 11:19.760
I knew you were
gonna say that.

11:19.760 --> 11:22.512
That's why I got
the surveillance footage.

11:22.512 --> 11:25.435
So I'm agreeing with Kaz'
ideas for now,

11:25.435 --> 11:27.437
but right before the race,
I'm gonna rebuild the drone

11:27.437 --> 11:29.439
to the way I want it.

11:29.439 --> 11:32.813
( sobbing )

11:32.813 --> 11:34.865
Dude, I'm the one
who should be upset.

11:34.865 --> 11:36.947
Why are you crying?

11:36.947 --> 11:40.030
Once I start,
it's hard to stop.

11:43.874 --> 11:46.536
Okay, I just put
the finishing touches on her.

11:46.536 --> 11:48.418
She's all ready to go.

11:48.418 --> 11:53.173
Really? So all of
my suggestions are in there?

11:53.173 --> 11:55.175
Yep. Even the 20-pound
confetti cannon

11:55.175 --> 11:58.178
that won't slow her down
at all.

11:59.599 --> 12:02.012
Liar! You were just
agreeing to my face,

12:02.012 --> 12:04.304
and then switched
everything back

12:04.304 --> 12:06.056
- to the way you want it.
- Kaz, I didn't--

12:06.056 --> 12:08.268
I don't wanna hear it, okay?

12:08.268 --> 12:09.900
And the joke's on you,

12:09.900 --> 12:11.611
because I entered
my own drone in the race,

12:11.611 --> 12:13.483
just to make sure
yours loses.

12:13.483 --> 12:14.564
What?

12:14.564 --> 12:16.566
Oh, I'll go get it ready.

12:17.567 --> 12:19.860
I just took one of
Mr. Davenport's drones

12:19.860 --> 12:21.701
that I found in
mission command.

12:21.701 --> 12:24.704
Where in mission command?

12:24.704 --> 12:26.206
The weapons room.

12:26.206 --> 12:28.668
The what?!

12:28.668 --> 12:30.460
ANNOUNCER:
All right, racers,

12:30.460 --> 12:34.004
ready, set, go!

12:35.836 --> 12:38.048
- You're going down, Chase.
- Kaz, no!

12:45.145 --> 12:47.057
Why aren't you
starting your drone?

12:47.057 --> 12:48.148
Afraid you're gonna lose?

12:48.148 --> 12:50.060
No. I'm afraid because

12:50.060 --> 12:52.772
that's one of Mr. Davenport's
attack drones.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.484
It's heavily armed
and programmed to destroy

12:54.484 --> 12:56.276
any threat it senses.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.698
Oh.

12:58.698 --> 13:00.450
Did you know that?

13:00.450 --> 13:01.781
No, I did not.

13:03.243 --> 13:04.784
Yeah, we didn't know that.

13:12.712 --> 13:15.335
Okay, firing off
an attack drone

13:15.335 --> 13:17.507
was probably
a bad idea.

13:17.507 --> 13:20.090
But it's really fast.
I think I got this thing won.

13:22.592 --> 13:24.684
Don't worry.
We'll just use the controller

13:24.684 --> 13:27.097
to land it.
Kaz, where's the controller?

13:27.097 --> 13:28.929
I don't have it.
I thought you had it.

13:28.929 --> 13:31.601
I don't have it.

13:31.601 --> 13:34.394
Yeah, we don't have it.

13:34.394 --> 13:37.607
That's because there
is no controller.

13:37.607 --> 13:39.990
The drone has
artificial intelligence.

13:39.990 --> 13:42.402
It's programmed to shoot down
anything that aggravates it.

13:42.402 --> 13:44.534
That just sounds like
poor design.

13:46.536 --> 13:48.708
It's not my fault.

13:48.708 --> 13:50.911
You yes-ed all of my ideas,

13:50.911 --> 13:52.953
and then yanked them out
when I wasn't looking.

13:52.953 --> 13:54.214
I heard it all.

13:54.214 --> 13:57.087
Look, I know what
you heard, Kaz,

13:57.087 --> 14:00.340
but after talking to Oliver,
I felt really bad.

14:00.340 --> 14:02.462
I realized I wasn't
being a very good friend,

14:02.462 --> 14:05.175
so I left all of
your ideas in the drone.

14:05.175 --> 14:07.267
Here. I'll show you.

14:14.144 --> 14:17.607
Skis, pretty smile.

14:17.607 --> 14:22.612
Fuzzy dice.
It's you, La Drona!

14:23.783 --> 14:26.656
Okay, all right, what
about the inside?

14:26.656 --> 14:28.618
Everything he asked for.

14:28.618 --> 14:30.290
I don't believe you.

14:31.661 --> 14:35.165
( mariachi music plays )

14:35.165 --> 14:38.458
That proves nothing.

14:39.589 --> 14:41.711
She's perfect.

14:41.711 --> 14:43.763
Thanks, buddy.

14:43.763 --> 14:45.555
I'm sorry
I ever doubted you.

14:45.555 --> 14:48.969
Okay, you forgive
way too easily.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.222
( drone firing )

14:52.222 --> 14:53.643
Incoming!

14:59.609 --> 15:03.693
Oh, yeah, I've definitely
got this thing locked up.

15:05.155 --> 15:06.906
We have to do something.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.079
The done has
a homing beacon.

15:09.079 --> 15:10.991
If I can tap into it
from my smart watch,

15:10.991 --> 15:13.623
I can program it to land
back at the penthouse terrace.

15:13.623 --> 15:15.125
Let's just hope it doesn't
detect a threat

15:15.125 --> 15:16.876
between here and there.

15:19.669 --> 15:22.802
( shuddering )

15:22.802 --> 15:26.306
None of the other Perrys
even made it to the other side,

15:26.306 --> 15:27.847
and I'm already
on my way back.

15:27.847 --> 15:30.310
Keep it up.
You're doing great.

15:40.270 --> 15:41.651
Are you okay?

15:41.651 --> 15:43.613
I think so.

15:43.613 --> 15:45.565
Although my tights
might tell a different story.

15:57.707 --> 15:58.918
Sorry.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.002
Sorry.

16:04.134 --> 16:05.885
This was never
gonna win anyway.

16:07.797 --> 16:09.849
Okay, so the drone
should be landing

16:09.849 --> 16:11.721
any minute now
on the penthouse terrace.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.764
I can track it
with my bionic vision.

16:17.767 --> 16:19.859
Oh, no.

16:19.859 --> 16:22.482
Oh! Oh, no!

16:22.482 --> 16:23.903
What is it?

16:23.903 --> 16:25.695
From here, it looks like
an unusual creature

16:25.695 --> 16:27.777
thrashing around,

16:27.777 --> 16:29.659
like a pterodactyl
eating its young.

16:31.781 --> 16:33.743
Throw in a brightly
colored tutu,

16:33.743 --> 16:35.415
and you're not far off.

16:38.328 --> 16:41.121
Don't panic, Terry.
I'm gonna fly up
and come get you.

16:45.625 --> 16:46.716
Look out!

16:47.967 --> 16:50.970
Skylar!

16:50.970 --> 16:52.182
I'll be okay.

16:52.182 --> 16:54.804
You go save her.

16:54.804 --> 16:57.807
Don't worry.
I'm coming to get you.

16:57.807 --> 17:00.270
Shouldn't we wait for
some real help to arrive?

17:26.216 --> 17:29.259
A bit heavy-footed,
but not bad for an amateur.

17:33.343 --> 17:35.935
Okay, I don't know how long
I can hold this thing off.

17:41.391 --> 17:44.444
Is this really how
I'm gonna go out of this world?

17:44.444 --> 17:46.646
Not if I have
anything to say about it.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.863
( yelling )

17:55.575 --> 17:57.457
Nice hit.

17:59.409 --> 18:02.252
Now I guess we just wait for
one of your flying friends

18:02.252 --> 18:04.043
to come save us.

18:04.043 --> 18:05.965
No.

18:05.965 --> 18:08.548
Perry, I know how much
this tightrope walk

18:08.548 --> 18:10.300
means to you.

18:10.300 --> 18:11.881
You're gonna finish it.

18:11.881 --> 18:13.923
I can't.

18:13.923 --> 18:16.015
I used all my energy
taking out that drone.

18:16.015 --> 18:18.348
I've got nothing left.
You were right.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.059
I don't have
what it takes to finish.

18:20.059 --> 18:21.851
Yes, you do.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.983
Look how far
you've come already.

18:23.983 --> 18:26.486
I was wrong.

18:26.486 --> 18:28.107
You can do this,

18:28.107 --> 18:30.069
and I'm gonna
do it with you.

18:30.069 --> 18:32.692
Okay, you're getting
creepy again, Brenda.

18:37.737 --> 18:39.118
Whoa!

18:39.118 --> 18:40.870
Give a gal a little warning
next time

18:40.870 --> 18:42.832
before you
loop-the-loop her.

18:42.832 --> 18:44.704
Something's
bubbling up.

18:47.457 --> 18:48.918
Skylar, what happened?

18:48.918 --> 18:51.881
I got zapped by a drone.

18:51.881 --> 18:53.843
Look what you've done.

18:53.843 --> 18:56.716
Oh, Oliver,
you're my hero.

18:56.716 --> 18:59.138
Look what
you've done.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.721
BREE:
We're almost there.

19:04.894 --> 19:07.937
Okay, just a few more steps
till you're back on the roof.

19:07.937 --> 19:09.979
( shuddering )

19:15.074 --> 19:16.906
You did it!

19:18.408 --> 19:21.951
I'm so sorry for
not believing in you.

19:21.951 --> 19:24.954
You know, your Grandma Gertie
would've been really proud.

19:24.954 --> 19:26.836
What do you mean,
would have?

19:26.836 --> 19:28.498
She fell, but
she's still alive.

19:28.498 --> 19:29.999
She had a net.

19:29.999 --> 19:32.051
You'd have to be crazy
to do this without a net.

19:32.051 --> 19:33.883
You put up a net, right?

19:36.095 --> 19:38.508
Yeah, we should probably
get down now.

19:46.976 --> 19:49.399
Hey.

19:49.399 --> 19:51.401
Look, I'm sorry
I ratted on you.

19:51.401 --> 19:53.523
Well, you should be.

19:56.276 --> 19:59.779
Well, Kaz would've
forgiven me by now.

20:01.281 --> 20:02.582
I only did it because
I thought you were

20:02.582 --> 20:04.494
trying to steal
my best friend.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.376
I wasn't.

20:06.376 --> 20:09.249
I mean, I know that ever since
I gave up being mission leader,

20:09.249 --> 20:11.921
everybody wants to
hang out with me
because I'm super fun.

20:11.921 --> 20:13.593
I wouldn't say
super fun.

20:13.593 --> 20:15.094
Okay, maybe just fun.

20:15.094 --> 20:16.886
Fun-ish.

20:16.886 --> 20:19.138
I'll take it.

20:20.930 --> 20:23.343
But you have to stop thinking
that I'm going after

20:23.343 --> 20:24.974
everything that's yours.

20:24.974 --> 20:29.309
Okay. It's just between
Kaz and the whole Skylar thing--

20:29.309 --> 20:31.981
There is no Skylar thing.

20:31.981 --> 20:33.773
I got her
her powers back,

20:33.773 --> 20:36.195
and that's it.
I don't like her that way.

20:36.195 --> 20:38.568
Besides, it would mess up
the whole team dynamic

20:38.568 --> 20:40.950
if any of us were to date.

20:42.161 --> 20:43.162
Fair enough.

20:43.162 --> 20:45.745
Except if
Skylar and I dated.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.578
We could conquer
our enemies with love.

20:50.330 --> 20:51.961
Right.

20:53.923 --> 20:55.925
Look, you and I have
more in common

20:55.925 --> 20:58.338
than anyone else
in the house.

20:58.338 --> 21:00.380
We should be friends.

21:00.380 --> 21:02.972
Can we put all of
this stuff behind us

21:02.972 --> 21:05.144
and start over?

21:05.144 --> 21:06.886
Definitely.

21:06.886 --> 21:08.648
Friends.

21:09.979 --> 21:11.270
Wanna get some food?

21:11.270 --> 21:14.063
Oh, I wish I could,

21:14.063 --> 21:16.566
but I already made
plans with Kaz and Skylar.

21:16.566 --> 21:19.399
That was a good one.

21:21.070 --> 21:22.822
Ready, bud?

21:29.248 --> 21:33.082
Oh, no.
Here come the tears again.
