- Hey.
- Hi.

00:04.254 --> 00:05.839
- What are you doing?
- Ordering tickets.

00:05.922 --> 00:09.259
I'm taking Tina, Ben, and Gary
to the new Colin Farrell movie.

00:09.342 --> 00:10.802
You're paying
for them again?

00:10.885 --> 00:12.011
That's so pathetic.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.555
Well, technically,
you're pathetic.

00:13.638 --> 00:16.265
I'm using your credit card.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.226
But, you know,
you should be thrilled.

00:18.309 --> 00:21.563
My first idea was to take them
to spring break in Mexico.

00:21.646 --> 00:24.566
Holly, your friends are going
to like you whether or not

00:24.649 --> 00:26.276
you keep buying them stuff
with my money.

00:26.359 --> 00:28.403
Yeah, but I want them
to like me

00:28.486 --> 00:30.280
more than they like Vince.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.949
They've got to, Val.
They've just got to!

00:33.032 --> 00:34.325
Today, he took 'em to the park.

00:34.409 --> 00:35.493
I've got to do better than that.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.454
I've got to do better.

00:37.537 --> 00:41.291
Okay, this little custody battle
that you and Vince are having

00:41.374 --> 00:43.793
over your friends is really
ridiculous, alright?

00:43.877 --> 00:45.879
So I think you need
to just talk to Vince and--

00:45.962 --> 00:47.297
Unh-unh.

00:47.380 --> 00:49.841
- I'm just saying--
- Unh!

00:49.924 --> 00:51.134
You forgave Tina.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.094
Yeah, but it's just more
complicated with Vince.

00:53.178 --> 00:55.346
I mean, we might still have
feelings for each other

00:55.430 --> 00:57.974
but then he slept with her
and lied to me about it.

00:58.057 --> 01:00.310
Tina's just my slutty friend.

01:01.311 --> 01:03.229
- Hey!
- Hi, guys.

01:03.313 --> 01:06.316
Hey, we were just
talking about you.

01:06.399 --> 01:09.694
So, how was the park?
Lame, cold, cheap?

01:09.778 --> 01:11.279
Yeah, actually,
we didn't go to the park.

01:11.362 --> 01:13.323
Vince took us to see
the new Colin Farrell movie.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.200
Oh, my God, he knew that I was
gonna take you to see that.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.243
Do you see how he's trying
to buy your love?

01:17.327 --> 01:19.496
And by the way,
we used to make out.

01:19.579 --> 01:22.332
So you should be
on my side, mister.

01:22.415 --> 01:25.251
Holly, there are no sides.
This is not a competition.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.296
Hey, hey, what are you doing?
No drinks before dinner.

01:28.379 --> 01:30.256
Vince lets us drink sodas
before dinner.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.300
Here you go, honey.

01:32.383 --> 01:33.885
You know what?
You're right.

01:33.968 --> 01:36.012
I shouldn't make you guys
choose between us.

01:36.095 --> 01:38.139
So I'm just gonna be
the bigger person.

01:38.223 --> 01:41.351
How about after dinner,
I take you bowling?

01:41.434 --> 01:44.687
Vince never took you
bowling, right?

01:44.771 --> 01:47.357
Not since Thursday.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.150
Uh-huh, uh-huh,

bowling in Mexico!

- What?

01:57.408 --> 02:00.411
Yeah, spring break in Mexico.
I'm taking you!

02:00.495 --> 02:02.455
How can you afford to take
all of us to Mexico?

02:02.539 --> 02:04.207
Well, my company has
a corporate deal in Cancun.

02:04.290 --> 02:05.750

I've been buying for you

09:56.971 --> 09:58.556
You just came all the way
down here to piss off Holly--

09:58.639 --> 10:00.474
If you let me finish.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.185
I thought you wanted
to be friends with her.

10:03.269 --> 10:04.979
I do, but we can't be friends

10:05.062 --> 10:06.981
until we have it out
and clear the air.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.733
And you couldn't do this
in New York?

10:08.816 --> 10:11.360
I wanted to get
a little tan while doing it.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.363
What's with the questions?
God.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.699
I cannot believe
that he came down here.

10:16.782 --> 10:18.868
I just wanna walk over there
and rip every hair

10:18.951 --> 10:20.411
off his smug little chest.

10:20.494 --> 10:22.455
No, that's exactly
what he wants you to do.

10:22.538 --> 10:23.539
He wants to get a reaction.

10:23.622 --> 10:24.790
Well, he's gonna get one.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.667
Wait, stop.
Okay, what does my mother do?

10:26.751 --> 10:30.379
Criticizes you and makes you
feel like you're nothing.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.214
For a living.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.549
She's a shrink.

10:33.632 --> 10:35.301
Vince is just trying
to get you all mad

10:35.384 --> 10:37.386
so that you'll go over
there and talk to him.

10:37.470 --> 10:40.431
I know these things. I listen
in on her phone sessions.

10:40.514 --> 10:41.974
[sighs]

10:45.144 --> 10:46.604
Watch and learn, my friends

10:46.687 --> 10:48.898
the art of the piss-off.

10:55.154 --> 10:57.239
Looks like somebody
lost a ball.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.783
Let's pray it's not you.

10:58.866 --> 11:01.160
It's not, it's not.

11:01.243 --> 11:04.080
Look at him, trying
to get me all angry.

11:04.163 --> 11:06.582
Well, too bad.
It ain't working.

11:06.665 --> 11:09.668
I am so peaceful, Tina,
I'm like Buddha.

11:09.752 --> 11:12.421
Only I'm tanner
and not from India.

11:12.505 --> 11:14.590
Or China or whatever
town he's from.

11:14.673 --> 11:18.219
The point is, I am at peace
with myself and the world.

11:18.302 --> 11:21.263
It's all good.
Ow!

11:21.347 --> 11:23.099
What is your problem?!

11:23.182 --> 11:25.684
Sorry.
It was an accident.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.937
Oh. Was it?

11:28.020 --> 11:29.397
Of course it was.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.315
What do you think,
I did that on purpose?

11:31.399 --> 11:33.859
Okay, looks like you two
are kind of causing a scene here

11:33.943 --> 11:36.112
and I can't get involved
with the Mexican police again.

11:36.195 --> 11:37.863
So see ya.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.199
Vince, it's cold in here.

11:40.282 --> 11:43.619
You're certainly pointing
that out, sweetie.

11:43.702 --> 11:45.204
So it bugs you
I'm with a girl.

11:45.287 --> 11:47.623
No, it doesn't bug me that
you're with a stupid girl.

11:47.706 --> 11:51.127
I just don't like balls
hitting me in the face.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.253
What is your problem?

11:52.336 --> 11:53.963
What's my problem?
What's your problem?

11:54.046 --> 11:55.631
I'm so sick of this, Holly.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.925
Why can't we just discuss
this like two adults?

11:58.008 --> 12:00.302
Because you're a big fat baby,
and I hate you.

12:00.386 --> 12:01.804
Oh, do you?

12:01.887 --> 12:04.056
Yes, I hate you so big.

12:06.225 --> 12:08.018
Look at you, you've only
been here two minutes

12:08.102 --> 12:09.854
and you already hooked up
with Cancun Barbie

12:09.937 --> 12:11.230
and her Mexican dream pool.

12:13.441 --> 12:16.152
Why do you care?
You and I are not together.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.445
We weren't together
when Tina and I--

12:17.528 --> 12:19.864
Had sex? Go ahead, say it.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.157
Had sex!

12:21.240 --> 12:24.535
Great. Now everybody
in Mexico knows.

12:24.618 --> 12:26.954
Hey, uh,
you want his ball?

12:27.037 --> 12:28.038
And you had a boyfriend
at the time

12:28.122 --> 12:29.498
so what's the big problem?

12:29.582 --> 12:31.292
The big problem is you
looked me right in the face

12:31.375 --> 12:32.334
and you lied to me.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.711
So did Tina
and you forgave her.

12:33.794 --> 12:34.837
What's the difference?

12:34.920 --> 12:36.172
The difference is,
I thought that maybe

12:36.255 --> 12:38.466
there would be a time
when you and I would..

12:38.549 --> 12:39.592
You know what?
Forget it.

12:39.675 --> 12:40.801
I was right.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.137
Not only can we not
have a relationship again

12:43.220 --> 12:44.847
we can never be friends again.

12:50.644 --> 12:52.188
Well, on the bright side

12:52.271 --> 12:54.899
looks like we'll have
two Christmases.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.406
[instrumental music]

13:06.202 --> 13:08.704
- 'Whoo.'
- How do I look? Too hooker?

13:08.787 --> 13:12.875
No. Just hooker enough.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.085
Oh, God, I feel like
I'm gonna throw up.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.504
I'm so out of date practice.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.380
Yeah, but you guys
already went to the movies.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.007
But you don't have to do
anything at a movie.

13:20.090 --> 13:21.592
Tonight I have to talk
and be funny.

13:21.675 --> 13:24.553
You know, small talk. I don't
have any more small talk in me.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.598
Okay, you, this morning,
you went on for 20 minutes

13:27.681 --> 13:30.059
about a dime you found
on the subway.

13:30.142 --> 13:32.728
Oh, yeah, I can tell him
the dime story.

13:32.811 --> 13:35.564
Yeah, um, sweetie, the only way
that story is interesting

13:35.648 --> 13:37.775
is if you hold the dime
in your cleavage.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.946
Holy crap. Your boyfriend
got you a limo!

13:42.029 --> 13:44.240
A limo?
Ooh, I love limos!

13:44.323 --> 13:45.991
Although, the last time
I was in one

13:46.075 --> 13:48.035
was when my wedding
was called off.

13:48.118 --> 13:51.580
Okay, remember,
talk with your boobies.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.666
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:53.749 --> 13:55.960
Oh, thank God, I almost
wore that same dress.

13:56.043 --> 13:57.378
[chuckling]

13:57.461 --> 13:58.879
No, seriously,
you look beautiful.

13:58.963 --> 14:02.132
I feel like
I won the lottery.

14:02.216 --> 14:04.843
See, today, I found
a dime on the subway.

14:10.057 --> 14:11.559
Well, shall we?

14:11.642 --> 14:13.644
- Okay.
- Ladies first.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.273
Wow, who would've
thought a smart guy

14:17.356 --> 14:19.858
would have such a cute ass?

14:22.528 --> 14:24.947
Uh, yeah.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.949
Chris, who are
all these people?

14:27.032 --> 14:28.200
My buddies.

14:28.284 --> 14:30.578
But why are they
going with us?

14:30.661 --> 14:34.582
(in unison)
Prom night!

14:34.665 --> 14:36.875
- Prom night?
- Yeah.

14:36.959 --> 14:39.545
Oh, I almost forgot.

14:39.628 --> 14:41.422
Here's your corsage.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.719
Dude, you totally
just touched her boob.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.346
- Right?
- Yes!

14:51.515 --> 14:54.476
[instrumental music]

14:57.646 --> 14:59.607
Oh, Holly, you're not
looking so hot.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.483
I think
it's food poisoning.

15:01.567 --> 15:05.237
The only part of me that
doesn't hurt is my hair.

15:05.321 --> 15:07.072
I told you not to eat
lobster in a restaurant

15:07.156 --> 15:08.782
that was shaped
like a lobster.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.451
[knocking on door]

15:10.534 --> 15:11.827
That must be Vince
and Amy.

15:11.910 --> 15:12.995
Are you sure you don't mind

15:13.078 --> 15:14.288
if we go to The Shins
concert with them?

15:14.371 --> 15:15.664
Yes, go.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.499
I'll take you
to a better concert tomorrow.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.792
Cool.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.838
[chuckling]
Well, well, well.

15:22.921 --> 15:25.507
Gary told me about
the fabulous lobster dinner

15:25.591 --> 15:27.176
you took everyone to.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.345
Looks like someone
got their just desserts.

15:29.428 --> 15:32.264
- No dessert talk.
- 'Really?'

15:32.348 --> 15:33.390
You don't wanna
to talk about

15:33.474 --> 15:35.934
a warm, gooey custard?

15:36.018 --> 15:37.645
Or how about a fried egg

15:37.728 --> 15:38.979
when the yolk's
all runny and--

15:39.063 --> 15:40.439
Stop.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.653
Vince, would you do me
a favor?

15:45.736 --> 15:47.905
Kick yourself in the ass.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.075
I can't do that.

15:51.158 --> 15:53.077
But I can do this.
This good? Huh?

15:53.160 --> 15:55.996
Stop it, please!

15:56.080 --> 15:57.956
You guys ready?

15:58.040 --> 16:00.834
Holly, I'm-I'm staying
here with you.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.044
Ben, no.

16:02.127 --> 16:03.504
You're so sweet,
but I want you to go

16:03.587 --> 16:04.838
and have a good time.

16:04.922 --> 16:06.256
Okay, but if
you need anything

16:06.340 --> 16:07.841
just call me and I'll
come right back, okay?

16:07.925 --> 16:10.427
Oh, Ben,
you're such a good..

16:12.304 --> 16:14.056
...guy.

16:14.139 --> 16:15.683
Come here.

16:15.766 --> 16:18.227
Now she wants me.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.063
Nice one.
There it is.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.231
- Bye, Holly.
- See you when we get back.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.942
Feel better, sweetie.

16:25.025 --> 16:26.568
Have a nice time.

16:28.445 --> 16:31.240
[Holly groaning]

16:34.660 --> 16:36.203
[groaning]

16:39.289 --> 16:41.125
[door opens]

16:41.208 --> 16:43.544
Ben, I told you to go.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.926
I know, we're supposed to be
hating each other, but..

16:51.009 --> 16:53.429
...I couldn't leave you here
all by yourself.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.806
What about Cancun boobie doll?

16:58.350 --> 17:01.186
You know,
she's not that smart.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.564
I told Gary to tell her
he was me.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.401
Need anything?

17:07.483 --> 17:10.154
Water? Aspirin?
A bucket?

17:11.571 --> 17:13.449
Just stay here with me.

17:13.531 --> 17:15.032
Okay, you know what?
Maybe a bucket.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.285
Okay.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.163
[instrumental music]

17:21.039 --> 17:22.915
Oh, God, you poor thing.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.002
It's like the whole
city has a cold.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.502
But don't you worry.

17:26.587 --> 17:30.591
This tea will unclog
those nasal passages in no time.

17:30.674 --> 17:33.135
Who's clogged?

17:39.099 --> 17:40.642
Hey, what are you doing
back so early?

17:40.726 --> 17:43.103
Oh, well, it turns out
my date took me

17:43.187 --> 17:45.022
to The Plaza Hotel
for dinner and dancing

17:45.105 --> 17:47.816
at his high school prom.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.818
Chris is in high school?

17:49.902 --> 17:51.570
Is he at least a senior?

17:51.653 --> 17:53.822
A-ha!

17:53.906 --> 17:54.990
Wow.

17:55.073 --> 17:57.493
He is a very mature 18.

17:57.576 --> 18:01.205
His friends called him
"Booger."

18:01.288 --> 18:03.540
Ladies,
if you want my advice

18:03.624 --> 18:06.376
and eventually,
everybody does..

18:06.460 --> 18:09.588
You have to meet somebody
who's closer in age to you.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.715
Someone that you can
have things in common with.

18:11.799 --> 18:14.259
Someone you can talk to.

18:15.552 --> 18:19.223
Ooh, like that
beautiful man tower?

18:19.306 --> 18:21.350
Oh, no. He's all wrong.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.101
Hey, babe.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.191
Wrong for you.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.902
This is your boyfriend?

18:31.985 --> 18:33.862
Actually,
it's more than that.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.239
We're soul mates.

18:35.322 --> 18:38.200
What happened to
"somebody you can talk to"?

18:38.283 --> 18:39.868
We talk all the time.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.662
Yeah, we talked
this morning.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.372
Twice.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.295
(both)
Wow.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.339
- Very impressive.
- Mm-hmm.

18:52.422 --> 18:53.882
You think it's her voice?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.926
I don't know, you wanna go back
to that prom and try it out?

18:56.009 --> 18:56.927
Come on.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.679
[imitates laughter]

18:58.762 --> 19:00.389
Louder.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.473
[laughing louder]

19:01.557 --> 19:02.766
That was good.

19:03.976 --> 19:06.687
[instrumental music]

19:16.572 --> 19:18.448
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:18.532 --> 19:20.242
Where is everybody?

19:20.325 --> 19:21.743
They went to the beach.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.745
You've been out
for like 14 hours.

19:23.829 --> 19:24.997
Are you kidding me?

19:25.080 --> 19:27.499
You know you talk in your sleep?
Who's Ricky?

19:27.583 --> 19:30.752
Martin. Please don't tell
anybody I still like him.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.465
So you stayed with me
the whole night?

19:37.551 --> 19:38.427
Wow.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.804
How sweet am I? Huh?

19:42.890 --> 19:45.517
I'm sorry I was so hard
on you these past few weeks.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.227
But I was just so hurt.

19:47.311 --> 19:48.979
I know. I know.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.939
But I don't wanna play
these games anymore.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.233
I miss you. I miss
hanging out with you.

19:53.317 --> 19:54.860
I miss fighting with you.

19:54.943 --> 19:57.195
- I miss that, too.
- Okay, good.

19:57.279 --> 19:58.447
So can we please go back

19:58.530 --> 20:00.157
to just being friends?

20:00.240 --> 20:01.533
I'd like that.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.913
But I can't.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.122
What?

20:07.205 --> 20:09.583
Holly..

20:09.666 --> 20:11.585
Holly, all I've wanted
for these past few weeks

20:11.668 --> 20:13.587
is for you and I
to be friends again.

20:14.796 --> 20:17.424
But as I sat there
watching you sleep

20:17.507 --> 20:21.929
I realized I don't wanna be
sitting next to you.

20:22.012 --> 20:25.641
I wanna be lying
next to you.

20:25.724 --> 20:27.601
Holly, I'm in love with you.

20:27.684 --> 20:29.144
And this..

20:29.227 --> 20:32.439
...this isn't good enough.

20:32.522 --> 20:36.068
I can't go back
to being just friends.

20:36.151 --> 20:38.320
Okay, Vince,
you're kidding, right?

20:39.863 --> 20:43.367
I'm sorry, Holly.
I...I can't do it.
