♪

00:19.644 --> 00:22.272
I got some fresh corianderwith your name on it.

00:22.313 --> 00:24.024
Ooh, be still my heart.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.067
It's coriander, Carley,not roses.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.277
I'd rather have the herbs.

00:27.318 --> 00:29.028
You're gonna go nutsfor the basil.

00:29.070 --> 00:29.988
Here you go.

00:30.030 --> 00:31.489
Whatever you're making,save me some.

00:31.531 --> 00:32.782
You got it.

00:43.251 --> 00:43.918
Hey!

00:43.960 --> 00:45.295
Hey.

00:45.336 --> 00:47.255
Best pretzel in New York City.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.339
You got it.

00:48.381 --> 00:50.592
Can't be the bestand not know it.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.260
Hey, it never hurtsto be reminded.

00:52.302 --> 00:53.970
Thanks, Tony!

00:55.805 --> 00:57.015
You're late!

00:57.057 --> 00:58.016
So are you.

00:58.057 --> 00:59.517
Not as late as you.

00:59.559 --> 01:02.270
How can you be chivalrous andcompetitive at the same time?

01:02.270 --> 01:03.396
What can I say?

01:03.438 --> 01:05.272
I'm a complicated guy.

01:17.619 --> 01:19.913
Mint in your bouillabaisse?Really?

01:19.954 --> 01:21.456
I don't have your loyaltyto the recipe.

01:21.498 --> 01:22.499
I cook by instinct.

01:22.540 --> 01:24.292
Oh, like your Duck a L'Orange

01:24.292 --> 01:26.002
that turned into Ducka la Carley?

01:26.044 --> 01:28.713
Better than the tedium in anorange sauce that you advocate.

01:28.755 --> 01:33.635
Not every dish has to endin a battle of wits.

01:33.635 --> 01:36.513
How about a truceuntil the next course?

01:42.310 --> 01:45.730
You take eyeballing ingredientsto a whole new level.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.816
It puts the art in cooking.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.234
And too much oil.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.528
No one ever measured their wayto a Michelin star.

01:51.569 --> 01:53.947
Make sure your broth doesn'tget too thick.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.156
Uh oh.

01:55.156 --> 01:58.576
You might have to improvise.

02:02.539 --> 02:06.501
Bouillabaisse is notyour best look.

02:07.168 --> 02:08.169
[laughs]

02:08.169 --> 02:10.713
I guess the truce is over.

02:20.139 --> 02:21.516
Hey, we made bouillabaissetoday.

02:21.516 --> 02:24.853
Those shallots, they shouldbe paper thin.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.771
I'm sorry, Carley,we're packed tonight.

02:26.813 --> 02:27.856
I don't have much time.

02:27.856 --> 02:29.232
You needed to tellme something?

02:29.274 --> 02:30.567
Yeah.

02:30.608 --> 02:32.694
I'm up for an apprenticeshipwith Francine Durant in Paris.

02:32.735 --> 02:33.736
Well, that's wonderful,sweetheart.

02:33.778 --> 02:35.196
You could learn a lot from her.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.489
Yeah, I'm really excited.

02:36.531 --> 02:38.533
You know, we're old friends,I could drop a word for-

02:38.533 --> 02:40.368
Oh, no, no, I wantto do this on my own.

02:40.410 --> 02:41.202
Thanks.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.537
As you wish.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.455
Cast a long shadow.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.916
Perhaps I could just give youone word of advice?

02:46.958 --> 02:48.877
Yes, Chef.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.546
Francine runs a verytight kitchen.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.381
Don't get too adventurous.

02:53.381 --> 02:54.549
Let's just seeif she chooses me

02:54.591 --> 02:57.510
and then you can startwith the lecturing, Dad.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.470
Fair enough.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.566
Alright, everyone.

03:11.566 --> 03:15.278
Today we are makingCoquille St. Jacques.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.654
Congrats on Paris.

03:16.696 --> 03:17.822
Oh, thanks.

03:17.864 --> 03:23.661
Yeah, Francine Durantis like my culinary idol.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.914
Uh, excuse me,where is Jason?

03:25.914 --> 03:28.666
I'm afraid he won't be returningto class.

03:30.960 --> 03:33.922
I don't get it.Why would he just leave?

03:33.922 --> 03:36.341
Yeah, he didn't evensay goodbye.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.843
I wonder what happened.

03:42.889 --> 03:44.432
I'm headed for the airport now.

03:44.474 --> 03:46.768
(Dad) You really don't have to do this.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.645
Always come through for you,Dad.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.939
(Mom) We'll see you when you get to Chicago.

03:50.980 --> 03:53.942
Alright. Bye.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.318
Hi.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.445
Laguardia.

04:16.798 --> 04:17.714
Great.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.841
A little bit more basilin the pesto.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.678
And just make surethat the batter

04:21.719 --> 04:24.305
doesn't overwhelm the shrimp.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.142
Hey.

04:28.142 --> 04:31.145
The tortellini primaverais really good tonight.

04:31.145 --> 04:32.647
It's the same every night,same recipe,

04:32.689 --> 04:33.940
same ingredients.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.066
That's the deal with a chain.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.859
Familiar mattersas much as taste.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.112
I've been general managerof this place forever

04:39.153 --> 04:41.239
and we've never hada better chef.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.323
Thank you.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.908
I understand your frustration.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.411
Sometimes I just wanna go wildand make an unconventional,

04:46.452 --> 04:48.955
unpredictable, outsideof the box primavera.

04:48.997 --> 04:51.749
I'll take it upwith management.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.460
Did you see Kitchen Showdownlast night?

04:54.502 --> 04:56.504
It's the best cooking conteston the air.

04:56.504 --> 04:58.464
The winner gets to opentheir own restaurant.

04:58.506 --> 04:59.507
They're coming to Chicago

04:59.549 --> 05:01.968
and looking for the bestlocal chefs.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.511
I know.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.846
I have tasted your cooking.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.974
I'm confident you havea shot.

05:20.194 --> 05:22.572
Oh, get more ofthat Sicilian olive oil.

05:22.613 --> 05:24.073
It is remarkably rich.

05:24.115 --> 05:26.242
And remarkably expensive.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.452
Kent.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.162
It is the attention to detailthat makes the dish.

05:29.203 --> 05:30.955
Were you that discerningwith your burgers and fries

05:30.997 --> 05:32.457
at the diner?

05:32.498 --> 05:33.624
Diners are great.

05:33.666 --> 05:35.877
Especially my dad's.

05:35.877 --> 05:39.380
I have been over a hot grillbut taught me a lot.

05:39.380 --> 05:40.131
Ok.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.341
I worked for a lot of chefs

05:41.382 --> 05:43.217
and they all had one thingin common.

05:43.259 --> 05:45.720
The best ingredientsmoney can buy.

05:45.762 --> 05:49.640
I should bring in my accountantand do a taste test.

05:51.809 --> 05:58.066
Kent would use canned vegetablesand paper plates if he could.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.609
You should go onKitchen Showdown,

05:59.650 --> 06:01.569
get your own restaurantand take me with you.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.904
I'm not kidding.

06:02.945 --> 06:05.865
I would be competing with someof the top chefs in this city.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.408
I do not have enough experience.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.994
Bail us both out before Kentgoes the paper plate route.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.330
Hey, you could get a job inany kitchen you wanted to.

06:12.372 --> 06:15.666
I'd rather do my slicing anddicing for a chef I believe in.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.211
Send in an application.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.379

07:13.182 --> 07:15.893
So, Kitchen Showdownis coming to Chicago,

07:15.935 --> 07:17.145
and I applied.

07:17.186 --> 07:20.940
If I could win that contestand get my own restaurant

07:20.982 --> 07:23.109
that would shave years offof my game plan.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.778
What's a game plan?

07:25.820 --> 07:28.156
A plan for something you wantto happen.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.949
When Carley and I were inhigh school we both knew

07:29.991 --> 07:30.992
what we wanted to be.

07:31.033 --> 07:31.993
That's right.

07:32.034 --> 07:33.202
Your mom was gonna bean architect

07:33.244 --> 07:34.787
and I wanted to be a chef.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.622
So far we're doing pretty good.

07:36.664 --> 07:37.832
I have a game plan.

07:37.874 --> 07:39.167
I want a dog.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.293
[laughs]

07:40.334 --> 07:42.003
That's not exactlythe same thing.

07:42.044 --> 07:45.006
Well, I wanna geta dog anyway.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.632
[laughs]

07:46.674 --> 07:48.885
It's all she talks about.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.179
It's part of her game plan.

07:52.054 --> 07:53.473
I think it's working.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.141
I'm about to give in.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.685
Welcome to Kitchen Showdown: New York Edition.

07:57.685 --> 08:00.646
We go all over the countrylooking for the best chefs.

08:00.688 --> 08:02.940
The winner in each citywill be given the backing

08:02.982 --> 08:04.358
to open a restaurant.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.485
It's a big prize and the competition

08:06.527 --> 08:08.362
can get pretty intense.

08:08.362 --> 08:09.447
I think you're gonna win.

08:09.488 --> 08:13.826
All you have to dois make this popcorn.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.871
You're my favouritefood critic.

08:16.913 --> 08:22.627
[phone ringing]

08:22.668 --> 08:24.712
Hi.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.255
Oh, uh, yeah.

08:26.297 --> 08:27.340
Great.

08:27.381 --> 08:28.716
Sure.

08:28.716 --> 08:29.550
Ok.

08:29.550 --> 08:30.885
See you then.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.553
Bye.

08:33.888 --> 08:35.556
I take it that wasn'tthe show.

08:35.597 --> 08:38.226
It was my dad.

08:38.226 --> 08:41.604
He's coming into townand he wants to have lunch.

08:41.645 --> 08:43.481
How long sinceyou've seen him?

08:43.523 --> 08:46.275
Six months.

08:46.317 --> 08:48.402
Hey, how old do I haveto be

08:48.444 --> 08:51.948
before I stop needinghis approval?

08:51.989 --> 08:55.034
Give it another hundred years.

08:55.076 --> 08:58.412
But you love him, right?

08:58.412 --> 09:00.248
With all my heart.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.959
Then you should be happy.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.086
She makes a good point.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.629
She does.

09:06.671 --> 09:09.924
Let's go watch the show.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.601
So how's your mother?

09:20.643 --> 09:22.603
She likes living in Vancouver.

09:22.603 --> 09:25.439
She and Henryjust bought a boat.

09:25.439 --> 09:28.150
Um... what brings youto Chicago?

09:28.192 --> 09:30.778
I'm doing some consultingwork for a company

09:30.778 --> 09:32.947
that wants to re-brandtheir restaurants.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.782
They're headquartered here,

09:34.824 --> 09:36.742
so you're going to beseeing more of me.

09:36.784 --> 09:38.619
You remember thatgame we used to play?

09:38.619 --> 09:41.831
The one I had to pick the secretingredient out in the dressing?

09:41.872 --> 09:43.749
Like it was yesterday.

09:43.791 --> 09:45.376
Every memory that I haveof you and me

09:45.418 --> 09:47.128
from when I was a kidis in a kitchen.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.337
Well, to be truthful,

09:48.379 --> 09:50.590
I didn't know what to dowhen you came for a visit.

09:50.631 --> 09:51.549
You seemed to like it.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.425
I loved it.

09:52.466 --> 09:53.884
Yes, you did.

09:53.926 --> 09:57.138
Until your rebellious teens.

09:57.179 --> 09:58.973
I was trying to define myself.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.099
Oh, was that it?

10:00.141 --> 10:01.309
Yeah.

10:01.309 --> 10:03.144
As I recall you put anchoviesin a frittata

10:03.185 --> 10:04.353
and I call that rebelling.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.730
[laughs]

10:05.771 --> 10:10.818
Oh, the things a girl won't doto get her father's attention.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.696
So, what's going onin your life?

10:13.738 --> 10:18.409
Well, I um... I just appliedto be a contestant

10:18.451 --> 10:21.829
on Kitchen Showdown.

10:21.829 --> 10:23.456
Have you ever watched it?

10:23.497 --> 10:25.541
I um, I really don't havethe time.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.668
Is that code for"I don't approve"?

10:27.668 --> 10:31.964
Carley, you cook to givejoy and pleasure,

10:32.006 --> 10:33.716
not for the notoriety.

10:33.758 --> 10:34.884
Yeah.

10:34.925 --> 10:38.679
It's just a shortcut to gettingmy own restaurant.

10:45.227 --> 10:46.604
It's ginger.

10:46.645 --> 10:48.522
That's what gives this dressingits kick.

10:48.564 --> 10:52.568
I also detect a dashof lime.

10:55.446 --> 10:57.073
Let's make a habit of this.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.617
I really hope to get backmore often.

10:59.658 --> 11:01.327
I would love that.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.120
Me too.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.378
Wow, those are impressivelooking omelettes, dad.

11:10.378 --> 11:14.006
Well, sometimes I like to dabblein the fancier fare.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.717
You are the best cook I know.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.511
Your mother has a crush on me.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.346
Yeah, I've noticed.

11:20.388 --> 11:20.971
Here.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.056
Thanks Mom.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.057
Ok.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.850
So how are things downat the restaurant?

11:24.892 --> 11:27.019
Well, you know, my staffis great.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.897
My boss isn't easy.

11:29.939 --> 11:34.652
Yeah, well, somedayyou'll be your own boss.

11:34.693 --> 11:37.738
So do you guys know that show,Kitchen Showdown?

11:37.780 --> 11:39.198
Oh yeah, I watch itall the time.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.535
Yeah, when we sold the dineryour father discovered the TV.

11:42.576 --> 11:43.619
[laughs]

11:43.661 --> 11:46.122
Well, they're comingto Chicago.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.249
Oh! You gotta get on.

11:48.290 --> 11:49.250
Yeah.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.669
I applied, and it's-it's a long shot,

11:51.711 --> 11:53.129
but if they're interestedthey show up

11:53.170 --> 11:56.090
at my restaurant unannouncedand try the food.

11:56.090 --> 11:57.133
So far, nothing.

11:57.174 --> 11:58.342
No, no, no.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.760
Maybe they've been thereand you just didn't know it.

11:59.802 --> 12:00.928
Yeah.

12:00.928 --> 12:03.764
I don't know, it's a long shotand my boss, Kent,

12:03.806 --> 12:05.766
he's hard enoughto please without me asking

12:05.808 --> 12:07.601
for extra time off.

12:07.643 --> 12:10.438
I think this is somethingyou really want.

12:10.479 --> 12:13.190
To prove you've got the goods,which I already know,

12:13.232 --> 12:15.609
but maybe you don't.

12:15.609 --> 12:18.779
You know, you came back to takecare of the diner

12:18.821 --> 12:20.781
when I broke my arm,

12:20.781 --> 12:23.576
and that's something I stillcarry with me to this day.

12:23.617 --> 12:28.080
Maybe this is your chanceto make up for lost time.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.124
Maybe.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.792
But it's a long shot.

12:31.834 --> 12:34.628
Well, sometimes thoseare the best kind.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.298
Thanks.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.558
Hey Carley, how's it tasting?

12:47.600 --> 12:48.476
Mmm.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.478
I don't think that hasenough kick.

12:50.519 --> 12:51.979
Every day feels likean audition.

12:51.979 --> 12:54.440
I don't even know if the show issending anyone to check me out.

12:54.482 --> 12:56.484
Not even my lucky apronis calming me down.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.818
What makes it so lucky?

12:57.860 --> 13:00.696
My dad gave it to me beforeI started culinary school.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.573
"Cook from the heart.Love, Dad."

13:02.615 --> 13:04.575
It's a little show of faith.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.494
At least that's what I liketo think it meant.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.829
I'm sure it did.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.960
Do you think the guy in the greysuit could be from the show?

13:15.002 --> 13:17.922
He's my dentist.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.465
How about the red vest?

13:19.507 --> 13:22.134
He doesn't look likethe TV type.

13:23.093 --> 13:25.888
Ooh, green dress, striped tie.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.723
They just arrived.

13:27.765 --> 13:30.684
Let me see what I can find out.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.275
The green dress mentionedKitchen Showdown

13:38.317 --> 13:40.236
and they ordered somevery good wine.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.363
I knew it!

13:42.404 --> 13:43.572
Now I have to go cookfor them.

13:43.614 --> 13:45.366
You'll be fine,assuming you don't pass out

13:45.366 --> 13:47.910
before the main course.

13:54.959 --> 13:57.586
A waiter told the Maitre'd thatsomeone from Kitchen Showdown

13:57.628 --> 14:00.214
was at the restaurantlast night?

14:00.256 --> 14:03.717
Oh, I... I didn't knowthey were here.

14:03.717 --> 14:05.219
Where does this leave me?

14:05.261 --> 14:06.762
Well, Jason can lay outall the menus

14:06.804 --> 14:08.347
and I can pinch hitwhile he's gone.

14:08.389 --> 14:09.557
Oh, mmm-mmm.

14:09.557 --> 14:10.724
Lots of people watchthe show.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.476
The publicity could be goodfor business.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.852
Yeah, it doesn't meanI'll get picked.

14:13.894 --> 14:16.063
Oh, but you're hoping awfullyhard that you do.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.690
I guess, yeah.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.402
Alright, if you do get on,

14:21.443 --> 14:24.238
mention this restaurantevery chance you get.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.156
Of course.

14:29.910 --> 14:30.995
I can't wait to tell my dad.

14:31.036 --> 14:33.080
He's gonna be overthe moon.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.920
Well, well, well.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.505
I finally caved.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.590
Her name is Daisy.

14:42.631 --> 14:43.883
She's very friendly.

14:43.924 --> 14:45.342
And she's very cute.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.220
[phone ringing]

14:48.262 --> 14:49.763
Excuse me.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.349
Hello?

14:52.391 --> 14:53.642
Is this Carley Benson?

14:53.684 --> 14:55.394
Hi. It's my pleasureto inform you

14:55.436 --> 14:56.937
that you've been selectedto appear

14:56.937 --> 14:59.523
on Kitchen Showdown.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.691
I can't believe it!

15:00.733 --> 15:02.776
This is such great news!

15:02.776 --> 15:05.613
I guess I can stop holdingmy breath now.

15:05.654 --> 15:07.239
Thank you so much.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.991
We start production on Monday and you'll receive an email

15:09.033 --> 15:10.492
with all of the information.

15:10.534 --> 15:12.077
Good luck.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.246
Thanks.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.623
I'm gonna be on the show!

15:15.623 --> 15:17.374
[squealing]

15:17.416 --> 15:20.085
I am so happy for you!

15:23.339 --> 15:25.341
Ok, you'll meetthe other contestants

15:25.382 --> 15:27.551
and then we'll doa quick orientation.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.469
Are you ready, Carley?

15:28.510 --> 15:29.637
Yes.

15:29.678 --> 15:30.971
Ok.

15:35.768 --> 15:38.437
Ok. Let me introduce youto the other contestants.

15:38.479 --> 15:42.232
This is Winston, Suzanne,Tina, and Peter.

15:42.274 --> 15:43.233
This is Carley.

15:43.275 --> 15:44.526
Hey.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.570
I thought there was supposedto be six chefs in the contest.

15:46.612 --> 15:47.780
Hi.

15:47.821 --> 15:50.491
Oh, here he is now.This is Jason.

15:50.491 --> 15:51.867
You're late.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.494
It has been a long time.

15:53.535 --> 15:54.787
Yes.

15:54.828 --> 15:56.246
What are the odds we'd end upon the same show together?

15:56.288 --> 15:57.081
Pretty slim.

15:57.122 --> 15:57.956
You think?

15:57.998 --> 15:59.333
Mmmhmm.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.501
Oh, uh, sorry.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.461
We were in culinaryschool together.

16:02.503 --> 16:04.004
And then you disappeared.

16:04.046 --> 16:05.881
Well, now here I am.

16:05.923 --> 16:08.175
Oh, and you all knowBeverly Chadwick.

16:08.217 --> 16:11.845
She is the host of our show andshe's also one of the judges.

16:11.845 --> 16:15.683
You are six of the best chefsin Chicago.

16:15.683 --> 16:19.478
It's a competition, but let'skeep it fun and respectful.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.356
It's a six-day shoot andyou'll have very long hours,

16:22.356 --> 16:28.112
but the prize of your ownrestaurant is well worth it.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.864
And if you have any questionsjust come to me.

16:30.906 --> 16:35.536
Win or lose, try to makethe most of this experience.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.706
[applause]

16:39.456 --> 16:41.375
Guess we're gonna be spendinga lot of time together.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.376
Yeah.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.169
Until one of us gets cut.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.462
I wish you the best.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.047
And I wish you the same.

16:47.047 --> 16:48.590
Try saying that witha straight face.

16:48.632 --> 16:49.883
You're not buying the smile?

16:49.925 --> 16:51.176
I really wanna win this thing.

16:51.218 --> 16:54.138
It's so funny you shouldsay that. I do too.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.895
Lights, camera,cook your heart out.

17:01.895 --> 17:04.147
Yeah, it is a bit daunting.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.898
Yeah. A dream kitchen, though.

17:05.898 --> 17:07.901
All the measuring cupsyou could ever need.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.111
All the counter spaceyou'll need

17:09.153 --> 17:10.570
for your random ingredients.

17:10.570 --> 17:12.906
Ok, we're gonna startshooting your intros.

17:12.906 --> 17:15.534
It's a way for the audienceto get to know you.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.244
I have a rather large resume.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.079
Well, the intros are shortand sweet.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.957
It's more aboutyour personalities.

17:21.999 --> 17:24.376
I don't do sweet.

17:24.417 --> 17:25.752
Oh.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.216
Tina, why did you becomea chef?

17:31.258 --> 17:34.762
I'm from New Orleansand food is a way of life.

17:36.096 --> 17:39.391
So uh, what did you doafter culinary school?

17:39.433 --> 17:42.227
I went to work inmy dad's diner.

17:42.269 --> 17:44.855
Yeah, it's a long story.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.273
So what about you?

17:46.315 --> 17:50.402
Um, I got a job workingfor Francine Durant in Paris.

17:50.444 --> 17:51.278
Wow.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.112
Yeah.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.614
Why did you choosethis career?

17:53.655 --> 17:56.742
I grew up near the bestrestaurant in London,

17:56.784 --> 17:58.952
so I suppose it was fate.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.662
So what brought youto Chicago?

18:00.704 --> 18:03.457
I got a job as head chefat Cafe Pierre.

18:03.499 --> 18:04.958
And also my best friendlives here

18:04.958 --> 18:09.296
so I figured it feltlike a good move.

18:09.296 --> 18:10.798
I'm the oldestof three sisters.

18:10.839 --> 18:13.133
My parents both workedso I became the cook.

18:13.175 --> 18:16.095
By the time I grew upI was hooked.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.429
Do you haveany family here?

18:17.471 --> 18:21.266
Just a goddaughterthat I borrow sometimes.

18:21.308 --> 18:24.228
And the occasional visitfrom my father.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.354
Uh... Mmm.

18:25.395 --> 18:26.730
I was going to be a lawyer

18:26.772 --> 18:28.232
and then I fell in lovewith cooking.

18:28.273 --> 18:31.068
So I cast off my tieand put on an apron.

18:31.109 --> 18:33.153
It's a much better fit.

18:33.153 --> 18:34.863
Well, I guess one of usis next.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.490
Yeah.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.783
You nervous?

18:37.825 --> 18:38.909
Does it show?

18:38.951 --> 18:41.245
Only when you speak.

18:41.995 --> 18:43.622
What made you become a chef?

18:43.664 --> 18:46.583
Well, my folks owned a dinerso I guess it's in the genes.

18:46.625 --> 18:48.001
Growing up my mom usedto take a picture

18:48.043 --> 18:51.171
of every dish I'd make and putit in a photo album.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.756
I apprenticed witha lot of top chefs

18:52.798 --> 18:57.469
but nobody loved feeding peopleas much as my dad.

18:57.511 --> 18:59.388
Why did you decide on cooking?

18:59.429 --> 19:01.640
Well, I spent half my childhoodin the kitchen.

19:01.682 --> 19:05.102
While other kids were playinghouse I was playing restaurant.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.896
Strange she didn't mentionher father.

19:07.938 --> 19:11.400
Maybe she...fears the comparison.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.152
It's a lot to live up to.

19:13.193 --> 19:14.486
It just always felt right to me.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.197
Like it was what I was supposedto be doing.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.825
I guess that went ok.

19:19.867 --> 19:21.660
Yeah.

19:21.702 --> 19:25.372
Diner to head chef.Pretty impressive.

19:25.372 --> 19:27.249
Alright, everyone.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.293
Your call time is 8:00amtomorrow,

19:29.334 --> 19:31.086
and then you'll meetthe other judges,

19:31.128 --> 19:33.547
and then we'll start shootingthe first show.

19:33.589 --> 19:36.508
Alright, have a good night.

19:37.843 --> 19:40.053
You know, culinary schoolseems like ages ago.

19:40.095 --> 19:43.640
But I still rememberyour Duck a la Carley.

19:43.682 --> 19:46.768
And I still remember you wearingyour bouillabaisse.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.854
Wow, it's weird to be competingagain after all this time.

19:48.896 --> 19:50.397
I wasn't competing.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.732
Ok.

19:51.732 --> 19:53.650
And my duck was not defying,it was creative and original.

19:53.692 --> 19:54.943
And a little too salty.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.112
Well, your duck was completelyby the book.

19:57.154 --> 19:58.155
But you remember it.

19:58.196 --> 19:59.573
No, I don't, andthat's my point.

19:59.573 --> 20:01.325
Memorable requires risk.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.535
And too much salt.

20:04.620 --> 20:06.747
Those two are gonnabe fun to watch.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.219
How'd it go?

20:20.260 --> 20:20.928
Hi.

20:20.969 --> 20:22.930
Uh, good, I think.

20:22.971 --> 20:24.514
Tomorrow we meet the judges.

20:24.556 --> 20:25.807
I'm kinda nervous they'rejust gonna see me

20:25.849 --> 20:27.684
as Kenneth Benson's daughter.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.311
You got there on your own merit.

20:29.353 --> 20:31.688
Everywhere I go in the culinaryworld I'm followed by

20:31.730 --> 20:35.192
his five-star reputationand judged accordingly.

20:35.233 --> 20:37.027
It's kinda how I judge myself.

20:37.069 --> 20:38.779
You're passionate and gifted.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.322
You'll make your own mark.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.283
Thank you, for almost making mebelieve that.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.118
[laughs]

20:45.160 --> 20:46.870
Now I have to go makemy daughter believe

20:46.912 --> 20:49.331
she can play the piano.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.583
[playing piano in distance]

20:52.542 --> 20:54.795
I think Winston's the oneto beat.

20:54.795 --> 20:56.004
What's the deal with Carley?

20:56.046 --> 20:57.798
Carley's very talentedbut she ignores the recipe

20:57.839 --> 20:59.299
and just wings it.

20:59.341 --> 21:02.427
She is incredibly stubbornwhen it comes to doing things

21:02.469 --> 21:05.138
her own... way.

21:07.266 --> 21:11.436
Jason doesn't think freedom orcreativity matter all that much.

21:11.478 --> 21:14.439
I also said you wereincredibly talented.

21:14.481 --> 21:15.524
Oh.

21:15.565 --> 21:17.609
Morning, everyone.

21:21.321 --> 21:22.656
What did I miss?

21:22.656 --> 21:25.158
Just Jason's assessmentof my cooking.

21:25.158 --> 21:26.493
Oooh.

21:26.535 --> 21:27.286
Hey, guys.

21:27.369 --> 21:29.079
Uh, they need you in the studio.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.873
It's time to meet the judges.

21:31.915 --> 21:33.417
Come on.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.300
I'm pleased to introducemy fellow judges.

21:42.342 --> 21:46.013
The legendary chef,Rafael Nola.

21:46.013 --> 21:48.515
The best of youare here to learn.

21:48.557 --> 21:51.685
I will be fair andbrutally honest.

21:51.727 --> 21:55.397
And the woman backing thewinner in opening a restaurant,

21:55.439 --> 21:57.524
Nora Blasio.

21:57.524 --> 21:59.943
You know, before I was arestauranteur I was a chef,

21:59.985 --> 22:03.447
so I know how it feels to bein your shoes right now.

22:03.488 --> 22:06.491
One of you will be eliminatedafter the first round.

22:06.533 --> 22:09.119
Try to focus on the cooking,not the result.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.497
Get yourselves prepared, we'regonna shoot the opening segment.

22:15.917 --> 22:16.918
Nice to meet you.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.713
-Hi, Winston. -Good morning.

22:20.213 --> 22:23.133
Carley Benson, you'reKenneth's daughter, yes?

22:23.175 --> 22:24.509
That's right.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.928
You may not remember this but wemet when you were a little girl.

22:26.970 --> 22:27.721
No, I do.

22:27.763 --> 22:28.889
I remember, yeah.

22:28.930 --> 22:30.390
Please give your fathermy regards.

22:30.390 --> 22:31.725
I will.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.562
Small world.

22:35.562 --> 22:37.064
Oh, we met once.

22:37.064 --> 22:38.315
I was nine.

22:38.356 --> 22:39.608
He's hardly a close friend.

22:39.649 --> 22:42.903
You know, I actually usedto be a sous chef

22:42.944 --> 22:44.946
in one of Nora's restaurants.

22:44.988 --> 22:48.116
We all have some connectionwith the judges.

22:55.415 --> 22:58.460
We always like to honour thecuisine of the city we're in,

22:58.502 --> 23:01.755
and you can't get more iconicthan Chicago.

23:01.755 --> 23:05.592
Your first assignment is to makea dish that got its start here.

23:05.634 --> 23:07.260
Good luck.

23:17.104 --> 23:20.398
Ok, you have 30 minutes to doall of your shopping.

23:20.440 --> 23:22.567
What if they don't havethe seafood I need?

23:22.609 --> 23:24.027
Well, then you'll haveto improvise.

23:24.069 --> 23:25.737
That's part of the contest.

23:25.779 --> 23:27.322
Ok, ready?

23:27.364 --> 23:30.492
Alright, get set, go shopping!

23:33.954 --> 23:34.996
How much more time?

23:35.038 --> 23:36.623
22 minutes.

23:36.623 --> 23:37.541
I love this place.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.209
It's my favourite marketin the city.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.420
My sous chef normally doesmy shopping.

23:41.461 --> 23:42.754
Who has the best shrimp?

23:42.796 --> 23:45.048
Try Matty's, it's right aroundthe corner.

23:47.050 --> 23:47.968
Following me?

23:48.009 --> 23:49.177
I could ask youthe same question.

23:49.219 --> 23:50.637
This is a cooking shownot a foot race.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.013
Actually, it's both.

23:55.016 --> 23:55.725
Pepperoni?

23:55.767 --> 23:56.768
That's right.

23:56.810 --> 23:57.561
Me too.

23:57.602 --> 23:58.478
Are you two together?

23:58.478 --> 23:59.729
Absolutely not.

23:59.771 --> 24:00.981
Could you give us a minute?

24:00.981 --> 24:03.108
Absolutely not togetherbut you need a minute?

24:03.150 --> 24:04.025
Yeah.

24:04.067 --> 24:04.901
What're you making?

24:04.943 --> 24:05.777
Deep dish pizza.

24:05.819 --> 24:06.653
Me too.

24:06.695 --> 24:07.487
Well, we can't makethe same thing.

24:07.529 --> 24:08.488
Well, what do you suggest?

24:08.530 --> 24:09.656
Well, I'm really goodat winging it,

24:09.698 --> 24:11.658
so I guess I can use allthe same ingredients

24:11.658 --> 24:14.452
and make pizza puffsa la Chicago.

24:14.494 --> 24:15.495
You figure out what you want?

24:15.495 --> 24:16.496
Yes, my own restaurant.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.206
Me too.

24:18.248 --> 24:19.416
I'll come back when you workthis out.

24:19.458 --> 24:21.042
That's ok, we'll take two poundsof pepperoni,

24:21.084 --> 24:23.879
spicy for me, mild for him.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.598
I need to get this in the oven.

24:43.190 --> 24:44.649
How do you work like that?

24:44.691 --> 24:48.528
You mean without all ofmy ingredients alphabetized?

24:48.570 --> 24:50.655
I need more onion.

24:50.697 --> 24:52.282
Hey.

24:52.324 --> 24:54.367
Filed under "O",where it belongs.

24:54.409 --> 24:55.660
Thank you.

24:55.702 --> 24:58.371
I wouldn't want you blaminga missing onion when I win.

24:58.371 --> 25:00.207
Less talking, more cooking.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.625
That's how you chop an onion?

25:01.666 --> 25:04.377
That's how you knead dough?

25:04.419 --> 25:06.671
They can't help themselves.

25:25.607 --> 25:27.359
The deep-dish pizza...

25:28.902 --> 25:30.737
was right on point.

25:30.737 --> 25:33.949
The crust and the sauce.

25:35.909 --> 25:39.913
The Shrimp De Jonghewas well executed.

25:39.913 --> 25:42.540
The sauce can be tricky.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.252
The pizza puffs, Chicago staple.

25:45.293 --> 25:49.214
But the prosciutto just gave itthis wonderful twist.

25:52.425 --> 25:54.344
I'm afraid we all had a problem

25:54.386 --> 25:56.846
with your thinly slicedbeef sandwich.

25:56.888 --> 26:00.600
The meat was overcooked andthe sauce was rather bland.

26:00.600 --> 26:02.769
The first showdown is over.

26:03.728 --> 26:04.896
Peter...

26:07.774 --> 26:10.527
it's time to leavethe kitchen.

26:13.280 --> 26:15.615
At least I got to takea shot, huh?

26:15.615 --> 26:17.325
-See ya.-Bye.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.161
Try and get some rest.

26:20.203 --> 26:22.664
Tomorrow we shootthe next round.

26:24.124 --> 26:26.126
Here's the upside of beingthe first one cut.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.752
It'll make a great storywhen I open up

26:27.794 --> 26:29.838
my incredibly popularrestaurant someday.

26:29.879 --> 26:31.673
Well, I will be the firstin line.

26:31.715 --> 26:34.467
Just don't orderthe thinly sliced beef.

26:34.509 --> 26:35.594
Ok.

26:37.596 --> 26:41.474
All the jokes are to cover uphow much he cares.

26:41.474 --> 26:42.475
What?

26:42.475 --> 26:43.602
That's very insightful.

26:43.643 --> 26:44.686
Don't sound so surprised.

26:44.728 --> 26:45.979
You really know howto take a compliment.

26:45.979 --> 26:48.898
You two bicker likean old married couple.

26:49.691 --> 26:50.734
He is right, and you know,

26:50.775 --> 26:53.153
if one of you twowins this contest

26:53.194 --> 26:55.405
it's not gonna be pretty.

27:05.665 --> 27:08.335
Your next assignment isa bit more personal.

27:08.335 --> 27:11.921
Each of you will make a dishthat represents your heritage.

27:11.963 --> 27:13.632
The kind of food you grew up with.

27:13.673 --> 27:16.259
And you'll be serving itto your families

27:16.301 --> 27:18.428
who are coming to visit.

27:24.809 --> 27:25.810
My son is 10.

27:25.852 --> 27:27.979
He's going to love being on TV.

27:28.021 --> 27:29.105
You ok?

27:29.147 --> 27:30.440
Oh, yeah. I'm just wonderingif my dad's coming.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.109
His opinion matters...to me.

27:35.111 --> 27:37.614
Carley... We're aboutto head for the market.

27:37.655 --> 27:40.033
I keep changing my mindabout what I'm gonna make.

27:40.033 --> 27:42.535
Whatever I pick my dad'salready done it and better.

27:42.577 --> 27:46.998
Oh, hey, he won't see itthat way.

27:48.416 --> 27:50.210
I bet he's proud of you.

27:50.251 --> 27:53.380
Becoming a chef like him?

27:53.380 --> 27:55.507
I don't know.

27:55.548 --> 27:56.758
I hope so.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.053
You're trying too hard.

28:00.053 --> 28:05.100
Just make something you hadwhen you were a kid.

28:05.141 --> 28:06.976
Go for the memory.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.520
Not the gold.

28:10.563 --> 28:11.898
[small laugh]

28:11.940 --> 28:13.983
Thanks.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.861
Of course.

28:16.903 --> 28:17.862
See ya.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.656
See ya.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.994
Chicken Kiev.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.544
Hey, there's my mom and dad.

28:34.254 --> 28:35.672
Is your dad here?

28:35.713 --> 28:36.756
Uh, I don't know.

28:36.756 --> 28:37.882
Hey.

28:37.924 --> 28:42.137
That's my brother, Reggie,and my grandma.

28:42.178 --> 28:43.513
Hey, isn't that your dad?

28:43.555 --> 28:45.223
It's so good to see you again.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.850
Rafael, it's been too long.

28:46.891 --> 28:47.767
Hello, Kenneth.

28:47.767 --> 28:48.768
Oh, Beverly.

28:48.810 --> 28:49.728
You look lovely.

28:49.769 --> 28:50.937
It's the lighting.

28:50.979 --> 28:51.896
One of the perks of being on camera.

28:51.938 --> 28:53.022
Not a chance.

28:54.816 --> 28:55.984
Hey. You got this.

28:56.025 --> 28:58.611
Stop being so nice to me.We're in competition.

28:58.653 --> 29:00.196
Ahhh!

29:02.073 --> 29:03.491
Try to relax.

29:03.533 --> 29:06.286
I don't seem relaxed to you?

29:06.286 --> 29:07.370
No.

29:11.624 --> 29:12.917
What's this called again?

29:12.959 --> 29:17.088
Beef Wellington, named afterthe Duke of Wellington,

29:17.130 --> 29:20.383
who was vaguely relatedto your great-grandfather.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.927
It looks really good.

29:22.969 --> 29:26.681
Your technique has improvedconsiderably.

29:26.723 --> 29:29.768
Carley was 11 when she attemptedto make a Chicken Kiev

29:29.809 --> 29:31.561
for my birthday.

29:31.603 --> 29:36.357
And as I recall she used twopounds of butter in the centre.

29:36.399 --> 29:39.360
[laughing]

29:39.402 --> 29:41.029
You've come a long way.

29:41.070 --> 29:42.489
I'm really glad you like it.

29:42.489 --> 29:46.576
You know, in the diner we callthis the 'Monday Night Special'.

29:46.618 --> 29:50.830
Yeah, except it didn't have thebacon or the porcini mushrooms.

29:50.830 --> 29:54.167
Boy, I- I don't know howit gets better than this.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.168
You know what?

29:55.168 --> 29:56.336
I should take a picture.

29:56.377 --> 29:58.171
Oh, no, mom,they're filming this.

29:58.171 --> 29:59.380
I think we're covered.

29:59.422 --> 30:00.256
No, no.

30:00.298 --> 30:01.549
This one's just for us.

30:01.591 --> 30:04.969
This is a meal to remember.

30:05.011 --> 30:06.846
Perfect.

30:06.846 --> 30:10.183
You know, when Jason turned15 I got him a suit

30:10.183 --> 30:12.602
and we went to the bestrestaurant in the city

30:12.644 --> 30:15.647
just so he could knowhow good food could be.

30:15.688 --> 30:18.483
And look at him now.

30:18.525 --> 30:21.528
That was the night I knewI wanted to be a chef.

30:31.412 --> 30:33.122
I like the Beef Wellington.

30:33.164 --> 30:36.000
The texture of the puffpastry shell?

30:36.042 --> 30:37.627
[kiss]

30:38.836 --> 30:41.589
Though not entirely traditional,

30:41.631 --> 30:44.676
your Chicken Kievwas quite good.

30:45.969 --> 30:51.349
Suzanne, your savoury ham andcheese crepes were delicious.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.979
Tina, we were very tornabout this decision,

30:56.020 --> 30:57.564
but the flavours in your Gumbo

30:57.564 --> 31:00.567
did not have sufficient time to marry.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.612
The second showdown is over.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.200
It's time to leave the kitchen.

31:14.163 --> 31:20.253
Well, I learned a lot and I hada great experience, thanks.

31:20.295 --> 31:21.796
Yeah.

31:23.172 --> 31:24.424
Bye.

31:24.424 --> 31:25.508
Bye-bye.

31:30.888 --> 31:32.223
Hey.

31:33.850 --> 31:34.893
Hey.

31:41.024 --> 31:44.110
I'm not gonna lie.

31:44.110 --> 31:45.737
This one hurts.

31:45.778 --> 31:46.779
I know.

31:46.779 --> 31:53.912
But you were short on time,not talent.

31:53.953 --> 31:56.581
It's just my grandmotherwas here.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.291
I know.

31:58.333 --> 32:00.793
I've seen the way she looksat you.

32:00.835 --> 32:02.754
You can do no wrongin her eyes.

32:02.795 --> 32:06.799
Do not let this shakeyour confidence.

32:09.135 --> 32:11.512
Uh, me and my brother,

32:11.554 --> 32:16.059
we're talking about gettinga food truck.

32:16.100 --> 32:19.854
Maybe I could have a restauranton wheels.

32:19.896 --> 32:22.398
Yeah.

32:22.440 --> 32:26.819
I think that's a reallygreat idea.

32:26.861 --> 32:28.696
Thank you, Carley.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.323
I really mean that.

32:30.323 --> 32:31.908
Yeah.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.747
Ok, you guys can go home.

32:37.789 --> 32:38.915
Make sure you get some rest.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.834
Tomorrow will be a long day.

32:41.876 --> 32:44.587
It can't be any more challengingthan today.

32:44.629 --> 32:48.299
I need a warm bathand a glass of wine.

32:52.512 --> 32:53.846
Do you wanna get a coffee?

32:53.888 --> 32:55.223
This evening?

32:55.264 --> 32:56.849
Who drinks coffee at night whenthere's so much on the line?

32:56.849 --> 32:59.018
I mean, if I drink coffee after8:00 pm it's impossible for me

32:59.060 --> 33:00.603
to sleep and I don't knowif you've noticed

33:00.645 --> 33:02.271
but my engine runs pretty highso it's-

33:02.313 --> 33:03.523
Well, a beverage is optional,

33:03.564 --> 33:06.150
you and your enginecan have decaf.

33:09.028 --> 33:10.405
Today was so intense.

33:10.446 --> 33:12.490
I was a nervous wreck.

33:12.532 --> 33:15.868
In culinary schoolyou were so polished.

33:15.868 --> 33:18.037
The designer clothes,the famous father.

33:18.037 --> 33:20.873
I find the nerveskind of refreshing.

33:20.873 --> 33:22.417
You were only therefor a month.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.502
That's hardly long enoughfor you to know my life story.

33:24.544 --> 33:26.045
I'm just sayingyou surprised me.

33:26.087 --> 33:28.923
I washed dishes and workedas a prep chef just like you.

33:28.965 --> 33:30.341
And just so you know,

33:30.383 --> 33:32.844
my ignoring the recipeis not arrogance.

33:32.885 --> 33:34.762
I never said it was.

33:34.804 --> 33:36.264
Things aren't alwaysas they seem.

33:36.305 --> 33:39.058
In my dad's kitchen everyonewould always say "Yes Chef"

33:39.058 --> 33:40.727
and I didn't wanna bea yes man.

33:40.727 --> 33:43.730
I wanted to stand out,so I started to rebel,

33:43.730 --> 33:48.651
and after a while bendingthe recipes became like a...

33:48.693 --> 33:50.570
badge of honour.

33:50.570 --> 33:53.906
It was my way, not his.

33:53.948 --> 33:56.826
I needed to do somethingon my own.

33:58.036 --> 34:01.539
I- I didn't mean to pry.

34:03.583 --> 34:07.253
So, how about youand your vanishing act?

34:07.253 --> 34:10.465
Why did you so mysteriouslydisappear from school?

34:10.505 --> 34:11.716
It wasn't mysterious.

34:11.757 --> 34:12.759
It was to me.

34:12.759 --> 34:15.887
Oh, so you thought of me.

34:15.928 --> 34:16.971
No.

34:17.929 --> 34:19.056
Not much.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.433
[chuckles]

34:20.433 --> 34:22.435
But I'd still like to know.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.853
Well, my dad broke his armand the doctor said

34:24.896 --> 34:26.522
he couldn't workfor three months.

34:26.563 --> 34:28.274
I couldn't let him shut downthe diner for that long

34:28.274 --> 34:32.277
so I went back homeand manned the grill.

34:32.320 --> 34:35.031
Family is really importantto me.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.033
That's not what I was expecting.

34:37.074 --> 34:39.077
Good for you.

34:41.204 --> 34:44.123
You know I guess I tend to bea little more traditional

34:44.123 --> 34:45.750
in the kitchen.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.835
I guess I tend to followclassic recipes

34:47.877 --> 34:50.838
in lieu of a fancyculinary degree.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.090
You don't need a degree.

34:53.132 --> 34:55.802
You're really good.

34:59.597 --> 35:02.350
So we're both secondgeneration cooks.

35:02.391 --> 35:03.684
Mmmhmm.

35:03.726 --> 35:05.478
And so different in the kitchen.

35:05.520 --> 35:07.063
Well, you know what they sayabout opposites.

35:07.105 --> 35:09.106
They both want theirown restaurant?

35:09.148 --> 35:11.192
[laughs]

35:11.234 --> 35:12.985
I know one thing we havein common.

35:12.985 --> 35:15.321
We both love blueberry pie.

35:15.321 --> 35:17.240
I love blueberry pie.

35:17.281 --> 35:19.742
It's my favourite pie.

35:20.952 --> 35:24.747
We should um, gofor coffee more often.

35:36.384 --> 35:38.010
They sent us home to pack a bag.

35:38.052 --> 35:40.471
The next challenge is ata resort on Lake Michigan

35:40.513 --> 35:42.557
and uh, the contestantsare gonna be cooking

35:42.598 --> 35:44.225
comfort food for the guests.

35:44.267 --> 35:45.393
How cool is that?

35:45.434 --> 35:46.394
I know.

35:46.435 --> 35:48.855
And I saw photosof the resort online.

35:48.896 --> 35:49.897
Amazing.

35:49.939 --> 35:50.857
It's right on the lake.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.358
Mmm. Try and have some fun.

35:52.400 --> 35:55.987
I'm not gonna be on the lakeI'm gonna be in the kitchen.

35:58.322 --> 36:01.242
Take this just in case.

36:01.284 --> 36:03.077
As you wish.

36:04.537 --> 36:07.331
You should wear that dressand those shoes.

36:07.373 --> 36:08.499
To cook in?

36:08.541 --> 36:10.293
Do as your stylist says.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.086
Ok.

36:13.087 --> 36:14.463
Thank you.

36:46.746 --> 36:48.915
This is gonna bea fun adventure.

36:48.956 --> 36:51.083
Too many variables inan unfamiliar kitchen.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.002
I don't want anythingto throw me off my game.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.254
I can understand that.

36:55.296 --> 36:57.423
I wish there was timeto go hiking.

36:57.465 --> 36:58.674
I have allergies.

36:58.716 --> 37:00.051
Nature isn't my thing.

37:00.092 --> 37:02.219
Being a chef, takingthat as far as I can,

37:02.261 --> 37:03.763
that's what I'm all about.

37:03.804 --> 37:05.264
Everything else I can takeor leave.

37:05.306 --> 37:07.308
Oh yeah, I'm the same way.

37:07.350 --> 37:09.185
I wonder if I have timefor a run.

37:09.226 --> 37:10.436
It's beautiful here.

37:10.436 --> 37:12.813
Seen one lake,seen them all.

37:12.855 --> 37:15.524
I really like this assignment.

37:15.566 --> 37:18.319
I can return to my diner roots.

37:18.361 --> 37:20.905
Comfort is a warm blanket.

37:20.947 --> 37:24.242
Food should be elegantand sophisticated.

37:24.283 --> 37:27.370
And maybe taste good?

37:27.411 --> 37:29.163
You sound just like my son.

37:29.205 --> 37:31.457
Well, he's a good kid.

37:31.457 --> 37:33.668
He's the light of my life.

37:35.127 --> 37:39.173
[phone ringing]

37:39.215 --> 37:41.425
Zoe wants to see usin the lobby.

37:41.467 --> 37:43.135
Right now.

37:49.266 --> 37:49.976
Hey, guys.

37:50.017 --> 37:51.310
Hi.

37:51.310 --> 37:53.604
So Beverly got caught up inmeetings and missed her flight.

37:53.646 --> 37:56.148
She gets in tonight so we'llstart shooting in the morning.

37:56.190 --> 37:58.109
What will we doin the meanwhile?

37:58.150 --> 37:59.568
You get the restof the day off.

37:59.610 --> 38:00.653
Seriously?

38:00.653 --> 38:01.862
That's great.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.656
I think I'll take a nap.

38:03.656 --> 38:05.074
Alright.

38:14.834 --> 38:15.584
Hey.

38:15.626 --> 38:16.627
Hi.

38:16.669 --> 38:18.754
I'm uh, going for a run.

38:18.796 --> 38:20.715
I'm going for a hike.

38:23.968 --> 38:26.053
Do you mind if I join?

38:26.095 --> 38:28.347
Yeah, ok.

38:32.685 --> 38:33.686
Let's go this way.

38:33.686 --> 38:35.062
I bet the view is beautiful.

38:35.104 --> 38:36.981
Oh, I think we should followthe trail.

38:37.023 --> 38:38.024
This isn't the kitchen.

38:38.065 --> 38:40.735
Let's take the uncharted path.

38:43.988 --> 38:45.364
I go hiking every chance I get.

38:45.364 --> 38:46.949
When you spend all ofyour time in a kitchen

38:46.991 --> 38:49.577
the great outdoorsfeels like paradise.

38:49.618 --> 38:52.079
That's why I go runningevery morning in the park.

38:52.121 --> 38:53.998
Another thing we have in common.

38:54.040 --> 38:55.708
We also wanna makeour fathers proud.

38:55.708 --> 38:59.837
And we both have the samedream, opening a restaurant.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.547
Do you ever pictureChez Carley?

39:01.547 --> 39:02.798
What it would be like?

39:02.840 --> 39:04.759
I think about it all the time.

39:04.800 --> 39:06.218
I want it to feel like home.

39:06.218 --> 39:10.723
Personal and inviting, the foodan extension of that invitation.

39:10.723 --> 39:14.643
Candles, fresh cut flowerson every table.

39:14.685 --> 39:16.395
How about Chez Jason?

39:16.437 --> 39:17.438
Well, it's got the candles.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.397
Mmmhmm.

39:18.397 --> 39:19.565
Plush seating.

39:19.607 --> 39:22.735
Friendly staff becausethey're well paid.

39:22.777 --> 39:23.944
You work in a diner long enough

39:23.986 --> 39:25.571
and you realize how importantthat is.

39:25.571 --> 39:26.739
Yeah.

39:26.739 --> 39:29.075
Organized kitchen,of course.

39:29.116 --> 39:31.911
And the best foodyou've ever had.

39:31.911 --> 39:35.414
The thing is, our dreamsare about to collide.

39:35.456 --> 39:39.251
Well, it could be Chez Winston.

39:39.293 --> 39:41.212
Yeah.

39:42.421 --> 39:45.633
See? Wasn't this worth it?

39:45.674 --> 39:48.302
Both trails leadto the same place.

40:03.192 --> 40:05.611
Do you wanna get dinner?

40:05.611 --> 40:08.197
Oh, it might feel a little bitlike a date.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.491
You still have to eat.

40:10.533 --> 40:11.867
That's true.

40:11.909 --> 40:16.288
Just a couple of pals strandedin paradise trying to kill time.

40:22.336 --> 40:23.629
Where are you going?

40:23.629 --> 40:27.216
Oh, uh, to eat dinnerwith Jason.

40:27.258 --> 40:28.592
We're just grabbing a bite.

40:28.634 --> 40:30.553
So you don't mindif I join you?

40:30.594 --> 40:32.888
No, that'd be great.

40:32.930 --> 40:34.682
I already ate.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.895
Have fun.

40:39.937 --> 40:43.149
But not too much fun,he's still the competition!

40:43.649 --> 40:47.862
You look very pretty, for a palwho's just killing some time.

40:47.903 --> 40:50.531
Well, my stylist made mepack this dress

40:50.573 --> 40:51.782
and she's very insistent.

40:51.824 --> 40:54.910
She's seven, but still.

40:54.952 --> 40:56.245
She has very good taste.

40:56.287 --> 40:58.247
Thank you.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.128
I remember our first dayof culinary school.

41:04.170 --> 41:05.129
So do I.

41:05.171 --> 41:07.047
We made the chocolate soufflé.

41:07.089 --> 41:08.757
Mine died in the oven.

41:08.799 --> 41:13.929
I was very aware of you and,to be completely honest,

41:13.971 --> 41:16.140
I had a bit of a crush on you.

41:16.182 --> 41:18.309
Why didn't you everask me out?

41:18.350 --> 41:19.852
I was about to.

41:19.852 --> 41:22.396
And then you left.

41:22.438 --> 41:25.483
And now here we are.

41:25.524 --> 41:30.154
Which is where, exactly?

41:32.031 --> 41:34.033
Let's find out.

41:39.121 --> 41:40.998
I'm having a really good time.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.708
So am I.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.293
Though I'm not sure that'ssuch a good thing

41:44.335 --> 41:45.836
given our circumstances.

41:45.878 --> 41:48.714
Well, our circumstances arewe're going for a walk.

41:48.756 --> 41:51.425
No harm in that.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.552
I guess our timing's off a bit.

41:53.594 --> 41:56.305
A couple years.

41:57.264 --> 41:59.391
What would you have said?

41:59.433 --> 42:01.435
If I asked you out?

42:01.477 --> 42:03.687
I would have said yes.

42:03.729 --> 42:05.606
I would have taken youout for dinner.

42:05.648 --> 42:07.316
Kinda like we did tonight?

42:07.358 --> 42:11.070
And then I would have walkedyou home, kind of like this.

42:11.070 --> 42:14.073
And then what?

42:14.073 --> 42:16.992
I would have kissedyou goodnight.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.869
Like this.

42:47.940 --> 42:50.943
You act like you've ever seena mixer before.

42:50.943 --> 42:56.198
I find it more comfortingthan the stares.

42:56.240 --> 42:58.450
Everybody knowswhat happened.

42:58.450 --> 42:59.493
Ah.

42:59.535 --> 43:01.245
Good point.

43:01.287 --> 43:02.579
I don't know what to do.

43:02.621 --> 43:08.669
Well, just focus on the cookingand the fascinating mixer.

43:11.338 --> 43:13.841
I knew they had dinnerlast night.

43:13.882 --> 43:15.342
Might work to our advantage

43:15.384 --> 43:17.303
if they get distractedby one another.

43:17.303 --> 43:19.138
That's a bit cynical,isn't it?

43:19.179 --> 43:20.889
But I question their priorities.

43:20.931 --> 43:23.892
It's certainly getting thema lot of attention.

43:24.810 --> 43:26.312
This is not the kindof attention

43:26.353 --> 43:27.605
that we want to be getting.

43:27.646 --> 43:28.939
It was just a kiss.

43:28.981 --> 43:30.190
We didn't break any rules.

43:30.232 --> 43:32.318
A romance betweencompeting chefs.

43:32.359 --> 43:33.902
This has never happened before.

43:33.944 --> 43:35.154
I think it's kind of sweet.

43:35.154 --> 43:36.655
Until one of them losesout to the other.

43:36.655 --> 43:41.660
It won't affect the judging butit'll be a bit more dramatic.

43:41.702 --> 43:44.788
I think that we shouldkeep our distance.

43:44.830 --> 43:48.292
Just until the competitionis done.

43:48.334 --> 43:49.835
Ok.

43:49.835 --> 43:52.338
Otherwise it's just-it's too complicated.

43:52.379 --> 43:54.840
Yeah, I... I get it.

43:54.840 --> 43:57.051
Complicated.

43:57.551 --> 43:58.052
Um...

43:58.093 --> 43:59.428
Yeah.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.055
I hope we're notinterrupting anything.

44:01.096 --> 44:02.848
No, nothing...nothing at all.

44:02.890 --> 44:04.433
It's time to go shopping.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.976
We're going tothe local market.

44:06.018 --> 44:07.186
It's very well stocked.

44:07.186 --> 44:08.854
Great.

44:10.356 --> 44:13.233
Make sure you capture enoughfootage of our cute couple.

44:13.275 --> 44:14.401
Where's the olive oil?

44:14.443 --> 44:17.029
I hope they have pearl onions.

44:17.071 --> 44:19.365
I can't find the cheesethat I want.

44:19.406 --> 44:20.991
What're you making?

44:21.033 --> 44:22.368
Shepherd's Pie.

44:22.409 --> 44:25.371
All of these are too strong,they'll overpower it.

44:25.412 --> 44:26.455
Try this gruyere.

44:26.497 --> 44:27.414
It's pretty mild.

44:27.456 --> 44:28.457
You don't need it?

44:28.499 --> 44:29.500
I got enough.

44:29.541 --> 44:30.459
What're you making?

44:30.501 --> 44:31.543
Macaroni and cheese.

44:31.543 --> 44:33.045
I made it a million timesin the diner.

44:33.045 --> 44:35.005
Thanks.

44:35.047 --> 44:36.256
And hey, to return the favour

44:36.298 --> 44:39.051
I'd like to offer someunsolicited advice.

44:39.051 --> 44:40.052
Ok.

44:40.094 --> 44:43.055
Since you know the dishso well, get creative.

44:43.097 --> 44:44.390
No rules, no recipe,

44:44.390 --> 44:46.892
just follow your instinctsand see where it leads you.

44:46.934 --> 44:50.562
I don't know how that cameoff, but it was meant well.

44:50.562 --> 44:53.190
That's how it was taken.

44:58.404 --> 45:01.073
This episode is gettingreally good.

45:08.247 --> 45:10.582
The oven is overheating.

45:10.624 --> 45:12.626
My lasagne is curlingaround the edges.

45:12.668 --> 45:14.420
It says 350.

45:14.461 --> 45:16.755
My chicken pot pie looks ok.

45:16.797 --> 45:18.382
Maybe it's the winein your bolognese sauce.

45:18.424 --> 45:20.551
And maybe it's the oven.

45:20.592 --> 45:22.261
The final decision is upto the judges

45:22.302 --> 45:26.140
but it helps if the hotel guestsenjoy your dish.

45:28.726 --> 45:29.935
He's trying the macand cheese.

45:29.935 --> 45:31.437
Mmmhmm.

45:31.937 --> 45:34.273
This looks really good.

45:34.273 --> 45:36.275
He looks happy, right?

45:36.316 --> 45:38.110
He's going for a second scoop.

45:40.112 --> 45:42.573
She keeps staring atthe Shepherd's Pie. Why?

45:42.614 --> 45:43.532
Why the hesitation?

45:43.574 --> 45:45.576
Who doesn't likea biscuit crust?

45:51.290 --> 45:53.625
The guests were very pleased

45:53.667 --> 45:56.295
and their feedback will be takeninto consideration.

45:56.295 --> 45:59.923
Now it's time to give youour decision.

46:01.383 --> 46:03.302
Your diner backgroundserved you well.

46:03.302 --> 46:06.472
The mac and cheesewas exceptional.

46:09.808 --> 46:12.144
And the biscuit-toppedShepherd's Pie was comforting

46:12.144 --> 46:14.771
yet sophisticated.

46:17.274 --> 46:22.571
Your dish, the chicken pot pie,succeeded on every level.

46:22.613 --> 46:24.698
I was impressed.

46:25.324 --> 46:26.909
Winston.

46:28.744 --> 46:32.956
The lasagna bolognese was abit highbrow for the assignment.

46:32.998 --> 46:34.583
I think that's opento interpretation.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.669
That was not the only problem.It was overcooked.

46:37.669 --> 46:39.004
Due to a faulty oven.

46:39.004 --> 46:41.840
No one else hadany complaints.

46:45.427 --> 46:47.262
Perhaps my dishwas more ambitious.

46:47.304 --> 46:50.516
Which brings us back toyour questionable choice.

46:51.934 --> 46:54.019
The third showdown is over.

46:54.019 --> 46:56.188
It's time to leavethe kitchen.

46:56.188 --> 46:58.649
I'm afraid so.

46:58.690 --> 47:00.275
Thank you.

47:01.610 --> 47:02.736
Pack your bags.

47:02.778 --> 47:06.615
We're headed back to Chicagofor the next round.

47:16.375 --> 47:19.670
I'm really sorry, Winston.

47:19.711 --> 47:24.091
I appreciate the sentiment,but what's done is done.

47:24.132 --> 47:27.803
It's not just about pride,you know.

47:27.844 --> 47:29.555
I want my son to thinkhighly of me,

47:29.596 --> 47:33.350
not see me defeatedon television.

47:33.392 --> 47:34.476
I'm the son of a cook

47:34.518 --> 47:36.562
and I admire his abilityin the kitchen

47:36.562 --> 47:40.023
but I love himbecause he's my father.

47:40.065 --> 47:42.818
And that love is forever.

47:42.860 --> 47:46.864
You know, if you weren't sotalented and still a contender

47:46.905 --> 47:50.075
I think we couldhave been friends.

47:50.117 --> 47:51.994
We already are.

47:57.040 --> 47:59.001
[laughs]

47:59.042 --> 48:01.378
You just riding up and downhoping to run into me?

48:01.420 --> 48:03.338
Yeah, something like that.

48:04.756 --> 48:08.594
I know this wasn't a vacationbut I had a really good time.

48:08.594 --> 48:14.516
Not just the uh, setting,but the company.

48:14.558 --> 48:17.436
Yeah, I'm really gonnamiss this place.

48:17.477 --> 48:19.271
Me too.

48:22.900 --> 48:23.984
[elevator ding]

48:25.986 --> 48:28.071
[giggles]

48:28.989 --> 48:30.407
We really need to workon our timing.

48:30.449 --> 48:31.909
Yeah.

48:46.381 --> 48:47.257
Thank you.

48:47.299 --> 48:48.133
You're back!

48:48.133 --> 48:49.051
I am.

48:49.092 --> 48:50.844
I gather you had a good time?

48:50.886 --> 48:52.638
It was wonderful.

48:52.638 --> 48:54.514
It was magical.

48:54.556 --> 48:55.807
Complicated.

48:55.807 --> 48:57.559
That sounds intriguing.

48:57.601 --> 49:00.812
I got pretty close to oneof the chefs.

49:00.854 --> 49:02.981
Did you wear the outfitI picked out?

49:02.981 --> 49:04.066
I did.

49:04.107 --> 49:05.192
I told you.

49:05.233 --> 49:06.318
Yeah, it was a hit.

49:06.318 --> 49:08.945
I should have you dress memore often.

49:14.493 --> 49:15.994
Hey, Dad.

49:15.994 --> 49:17.162
Hi.

49:17.204 --> 49:19.581
Um, I was here for some meetingsand wanted to see you

49:19.623 --> 49:21.625
but, well, now I have to leave.

49:21.667 --> 49:26.463
Oh, I was with Kitchen Showdown,they took us out of town.

49:26.505 --> 49:29.091
I'm so sorry I missed you.

49:29.132 --> 49:31.218
Well, maybe next time.

49:32.177 --> 49:34.304
Is everything ok?

49:34.346 --> 49:35.639
Oh, sure.

49:35.681 --> 49:38.892
I'm- well, I just miss you,that's all.

49:40.143 --> 49:42.562
I miss you, too.

49:42.604 --> 49:45.857
More than I let on.

49:47.859 --> 49:50.987
I'll try and get back soon.

50:13.677 --> 50:23.687
[phone ringing]

50:24.396 --> 50:25.856
Kent.

50:25.897 --> 50:27.232
I've been trying to reach you.

50:27.274 --> 50:29.401
Yeah, I'm- I'm sorry, I was outof town with the show.

50:29.401 --> 50:30.736
It's been over a week.

50:30.777 --> 50:32.821
Frankly, I thought you'd beeliminated by now.

50:32.863 --> 50:34.364
Is he still in the contest?

50:34.406 --> 50:35.615
Well, so did I.

50:35.657 --> 50:37.576
Look, I will check inwith you every day.

50:37.617 --> 50:38.452
I have to go.

50:38.493 --> 50:40.162
I have a restaurant to run.

50:40.412 --> 50:41.747
I...

50:46.668 --> 50:47.794
[exhales]

50:55.052 --> 50:56.511
Hi.

50:56.553 --> 50:57.596
Hi.

50:57.637 --> 50:59.931
You made it to the final three.Congratulations.

50:59.973 --> 51:00.849
Thanks.

51:00.891 --> 51:01.933
Do you have a minute?

51:01.975 --> 51:03.435
Sure.

51:04.436 --> 51:10.108
It's about Carley and Jasonand their relationship.

51:10.108 --> 51:12.319
It's an interesting twist.

51:12.360 --> 51:16.948
I'm just afraid they'll get moreattention from the judges.

51:16.948 --> 51:18.033
Well, don't worry.

51:18.074 --> 51:20.243
The next round of thecompetition is blind.

51:20.285 --> 51:23.330
The judges won't knowwho made what dish.

51:23.371 --> 51:26.249
So just concentrateon your cooking.

51:31.463 --> 51:32.839
Hey.

51:32.881 --> 51:35.258
Hello.

51:35.300 --> 51:39.304
You'll be creating a dishthat is typical

51:39.346 --> 51:41.807
of classic French cuisine.

51:41.848 --> 51:46.853
Since the contest is blindyou will each get a sous chef.

51:47.646 --> 51:49.856
Hey.

51:49.898 --> 51:52.484
You'll be picking namesout of a hat.

51:52.484 --> 51:54.236
Here you go.

51:54.277 --> 51:55.487
Ok.

51:58.532 --> 51:59.574
Peter.

51:59.616 --> 52:01.326
Hey.

52:05.038 --> 52:06.706
Winston.

52:09.084 --> 52:10.585
Hey.

52:13.338 --> 52:15.298
Ok, everybody.

52:17.008 --> 52:19.052
Let's get cooking.

52:19.094 --> 52:21.388
So uh, me and my brotherare gonna do it.

52:21.429 --> 52:22.806
We're getting a food truck.

52:22.848 --> 52:23.974
Tina, that's great!

52:24.015 --> 52:24.850
Yeah.

52:24.850 --> 52:26.476
We're gonna call it"The Big Easy"

52:26.518 --> 52:28.270
and we're gonna bringNew Orleans to the mid-west.

52:28.311 --> 52:30.397
Your grandmotheris gonna love that.

52:30.438 --> 52:31.314
Oh yeah.

52:31.356 --> 52:32.983
Hey, how are thingsgoing here?

52:33.024 --> 52:34.651
Looks like it's gettingpretty intense.

52:34.693 --> 52:36.653
Yeah, I'm trying to focuson the cooking,

52:36.695 --> 52:37.863
not the competition.

52:37.863 --> 52:39.406
Zoe did say that youand Jason have become

52:39.447 --> 52:41.032
more than just competitors.

52:41.032 --> 52:43.618
Well, whatever we are,

52:43.660 --> 52:45.829
it's on hold untilafter the competition.

52:45.871 --> 52:49.291
Ok, understood.

52:49.332 --> 52:50.500
You're using pancetta?

52:50.542 --> 52:51.793
Yeah.

52:51.835 --> 52:52.878
And cognac.

52:52.919 --> 52:54.254
I'm gonna make the judgesa Beef Bourguignon

52:54.296 --> 52:56.339
they're never gonna forget.

52:57.132 --> 52:58.592
I like it.

53:03.555 --> 53:04.306
Mmm.

53:04.347 --> 53:05.640
How's things going?

53:05.682 --> 53:07.809
A lot of pressure butI'm hanging in there.

53:07.851 --> 53:09.895
You're doing something right.

53:12.272 --> 53:13.607
I really want this.

53:13.648 --> 53:14.441
You could win it.

53:14.482 --> 53:16.318
It's just the three of you now.

53:16.359 --> 53:19.738
Yeah, I just- I worry howthat would play out with Carley.

53:19.738 --> 53:21.907
Oh, so the rumour is true.

53:21.948 --> 53:24.784
It's more than just a rumour.

53:24.826 --> 53:26.411
I really like her.

53:26.411 --> 53:27.579
It's quite a dilemma.

53:27.621 --> 53:30.165
The restaurantor the girl.

53:35.795 --> 53:37.505
I like Carley and Jason,I really do.

53:37.547 --> 53:39.507
But neither of them is readyto have their own restaurant.

53:39.549 --> 53:42.135
Apparently, the judgesdon't share your opinion.

53:42.177 --> 53:43.845
Although they did havethe profound misjudgement

53:43.887 --> 53:45.096
to eliminate me.

53:45.096 --> 53:46.848
This flirtation they're havingillustrates my point.

53:46.890 --> 53:49.100
They don't understandwhat's at stake.

53:49.142 --> 53:50.977
Forget about themand pay more attention

53:51.019 --> 53:53.188
to your congealing sauce.

53:58.944 --> 54:01.029
I always enjoythe blind contest.

54:01.071 --> 54:03.448
It adds a layer of mysteryto the judging.

54:03.448 --> 54:06.952
It's easy to get sidetracked bythe personalities of the chefs,

54:06.952 --> 54:08.912
their story.

54:08.954 --> 54:11.623
We'll begin with the Cassoulet.

54:11.623 --> 54:12.582
Mmm.

54:12.624 --> 54:14.751
The proportionsare exactly right.

54:14.793 --> 54:16.586
Subtle and yet compelling.

54:16.628 --> 54:19.172
This belongs on the menu.

54:19.881 --> 54:21.716
I gather you're the Cassoulet.

54:21.758 --> 54:23.051
That would be me.

54:23.093 --> 54:23.969
Congrats.

54:23.969 --> 54:25.553
Thanks.

54:26.179 --> 54:27.722
Now, the Beef Bourguignon.

54:27.764 --> 54:29.015
It's very good.

54:29.057 --> 54:32.477
It takes a moment to adjustto the contrasting flavours.

54:32.519 --> 54:34.229
Pancetta can be a bitoverwhelming,

54:34.271 --> 54:35.438
but not in this case.

54:35.480 --> 54:36.523
I don't agree.

54:36.564 --> 54:37.983
There's no respect forthe classic French dish.

54:37.983 --> 54:40.443
The chef has takentoo many liberties.

54:45.198 --> 54:46.157
I'm fine.

54:46.157 --> 54:47.158
Really.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.369
This is so incredibly stressful.

54:49.953 --> 54:53.373
Our last dish is the Coq au Vin.

54:53.415 --> 54:57.419
There's no surprises butthe execution shows real skill.

54:57.460 --> 54:59.004
This is a traditionalCoq au Vin,

54:59.004 --> 55:00.797
very much in keepingwith the assignment.

55:00.839 --> 55:03.383
The sauce is everythingin a Coq au Vin.

55:03.425 --> 55:05.468
I find it too creamy.

55:11.307 --> 55:13.685
You can take a break whilethe judges deliberate.

55:13.685 --> 55:15.729
Try and relax.

55:15.770 --> 55:18.231
I'll be back shortly.

55:18.273 --> 55:20.442
Well, I don't know howwe're supposed to relax.

55:20.483 --> 55:22.652
I've never felt so unrelaxedin my life.

55:22.694 --> 55:23.695
I know what you mean.

55:23.737 --> 55:24.988
What do you have to beunrelaxed about?

55:25.030 --> 55:27.198
You're safe in this round.

55:27.240 --> 55:28.491
Not necessarily.

55:28.533 --> 55:31.953
Hey, your dish wasa home run.

55:31.995 --> 55:34.080
You should worry about winning,

55:34.122 --> 55:36.416
and you're worriedabout each other.

55:37.208 --> 55:38.335
[knocking]

55:38.376 --> 55:40.170
The judges are ready.

55:57.896 --> 56:00.148
Welcome back.

56:00.190 --> 56:04.569
We still don't knowwho made which dish,

56:04.611 --> 56:07.739
but we are ready to giveyou our decision.

56:11.242 --> 56:16.247
The Cassoulet was exceptional,we all agreed on that, right?

56:20.085 --> 56:23.254
The Coq au Vin wasauthentically French,

56:23.254 --> 56:27.801
but I had a problem withthe consistency of the sauce.

56:29.761 --> 56:33.348
The Beef Bourguignonhad too many components.

56:34.057 --> 56:38.353
There's a fine line betweencreative and over the top.

56:41.064 --> 56:44.359
Please, stand nextto your dish.

56:52.617 --> 56:54.160
Oh, you made the Cassoulet.

56:54.202 --> 56:56.079
Well done.

56:56.121 --> 56:59.124
The Coq au Vin, andthe Beef Bourguignon.

56:59.124 --> 57:02.377
The voting was very close.

57:07.382 --> 57:10.260
The fourth showdownis over.

57:12.512 --> 57:14.305
Suzanne...

57:19.477 --> 57:22.897
It's time to leavethe kitchen.

57:26.568 --> 57:29.696
Thank you for the opportunity.

57:33.199 --> 57:36.744
Now it's head to head.

57:36.786 --> 57:40.790
One of you is about to getyour own restaurant.

57:43.918 --> 57:48.381
And the other one goes home.

57:57.849 --> 57:59.267
How do you feel?

57:59.309 --> 58:03.855
Uh, scared, happy,everything in between.

58:03.855 --> 58:05.773
Uh, what she said.

58:05.815 --> 58:07.650
Go home, get some rest.

58:07.692 --> 58:10.069
Tomorrow we shoot the showthat's gonna change

58:10.111 --> 58:12.655
one of your lives.

58:16.951 --> 58:18.953
If the viewers will feelexactly like me.

58:18.995 --> 58:20.955
They'll root for them both.

58:20.997 --> 58:22.707
Only one can win.

58:22.707 --> 58:24.417
I hate cliff-hangers.

58:24.459 --> 58:26.711
Everyone should havea happy ending.

58:26.753 --> 58:31.341
It's a cooking contest,not a romance novel.

58:35.720 --> 58:37.388
Still opening doors for me,huh?

58:37.430 --> 58:39.641
What can I say,old habits die hard.

58:39.682 --> 58:42.060
Competitive and chivalrous.

58:42.101 --> 58:43.770
So, tomorrow's the big day.

58:43.811 --> 58:44.812
Yeah.

58:44.854 --> 58:47.857
Suddenly "good luck"seems so conflicted.

58:47.899 --> 58:49.567
Maybe I'll call you later?

58:49.609 --> 58:51.611
Just to see how you're doing?

58:51.653 --> 58:53.029
Maybe you shouldn't.

58:53.071 --> 58:55.615
I mean, you can call me.

58:55.657 --> 58:58.243
You don't have to.

58:58.284 --> 59:00.036
It's up to you.

59:00.078 --> 59:03.414
You sound like how I feel.

59:03.456 --> 59:06.543
Well, goodnight.

59:06.584 --> 59:08.461
Goodnight.

59:13.049 --> 59:15.969
[phone ringing]

59:17.804 --> 59:18.930
Hey, Kent.

59:18.930 --> 59:20.723
We need to talkin person.

59:20.765 --> 59:22.475
I'd like you to cometo the restaurant.

59:22.517 --> 59:24.394
Ok, I'll see you soon.

59:31.776 --> 59:32.694
Hey.

59:33.861 --> 59:35.363
Hey.

59:35.405 --> 59:36.447
Look who's here.

59:36.489 --> 59:38.616
Yeah, well uh, Kent wantedto see me.

59:38.658 --> 59:40.618
Hey, what's going onwith the show?

59:40.660 --> 59:42.537
Only two of us left.

59:43.955 --> 59:45.707
That's whatI'm talking about.

59:45.748 --> 59:46.624
Yes!

59:46.666 --> 59:48.126
Hello, Jason.

59:48.167 --> 59:49.585
A word?

59:57.010 --> 01:00:00.179
This contest has put thingsin perspective for me-

01:00:00.221 --> 01:00:01.764
And it's almost over.

01:00:01.806 --> 01:00:03.057
And then what?

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:06.519
I mean, if you win you'll beopening your own restaurant.

01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:09.814
Well, there's a 50/50 chanceI'll lose.

01:00:09.814 --> 01:00:11.149
Let's be honest.

01:00:11.149 --> 01:00:14.152
You and I were nevera good fit.

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:16.738
So I've hired another chef.

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:18.823
You're firing me?

01:00:18.823 --> 01:00:19.907
Now?

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:22.493
You can't do that.

01:00:22.493 --> 01:00:24.078
I'm sorry it had to endthis way.

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.372
But I think it's forthe best.

01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:40.011
Usually baking reallyhelps me relax.

01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:41.095
Is it working?

01:00:41.137 --> 01:00:42.472
Not at all.

01:00:42.513 --> 01:00:45.183
I only have one day until I findout if my dream is coming true.

01:00:45.183 --> 01:00:47.852
I can't think about thator else I won't sleep.

01:00:47.894 --> 01:00:50.897
I can't even imaginethe pressure.

01:00:50.938 --> 01:00:53.858
Hey, it's almost your bed time.

01:00:53.858 --> 01:00:54.984
One more cookie.

01:00:55.026 --> 01:00:57.528
They're so good.

01:00:57.528 --> 01:01:00.281
You promised to show usthe pictures from your trip.

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:02.700
You're right, I did.

01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:04.535
Ok, let's see.

01:01:04.535 --> 01:01:11.167
This is me and my friend,Jason.

01:01:11.209 --> 01:01:12.543
He looks nice.

01:01:12.543 --> 01:01:13.586
He is.

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:14.921
He's the other chef.

01:01:14.962 --> 01:01:16.881
Tomorrow it's him or me.

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:19.717
And you like him.

01:01:19.717 --> 01:01:20.885
I do.

01:01:20.927 --> 01:01:24.764
Even if you win he could stillbe your friend.

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:27.392
I really hope so.

01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:29.060
Ok, no.

01:01:29.102 --> 01:01:32.021
Now it's time to gohome to bed.

01:01:32.063 --> 01:01:33.981
Goodnight, Emma.

01:01:35.608 --> 01:01:37.735
I hope you get everythingyou want.

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:39.028
Thank you.

01:01:39.070 --> 01:01:40.738
Thanks.

01:01:47.745 --> 01:01:52.083
[phone ringing]

01:01:52.125 --> 01:01:54.585
I was just about to call you.

01:01:54.585 --> 01:01:58.715
I just wanted to say goodnightand good luck.

01:01:58.756 --> 01:02:01.092
That sounds so stupid.

01:02:02.844 --> 01:02:04.262
How're you doing?

01:02:04.262 --> 01:02:07.014
I've been better.

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:09.600
Do you wanna go for a walkor something?

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:12.103
It might take some ofthe pressure off tomorrow.

01:02:12.103 --> 01:02:14.439
We'd have to walka hundred miles.

01:02:14.439 --> 01:02:18.151
Well, how about we start with afew blocks and see how it goes?

01:02:20.486 --> 01:02:23.030
Alright, 99 more milesand I should be good.

01:02:23.072 --> 01:02:25.658
Yeah, I needed to get outof my head for a while, too.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:26.868
Yeah.

01:02:26.909 --> 01:02:27.994
[phone ringing]

01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:29.287
Oh, sorry.

01:02:29.328 --> 01:02:30.121
I...

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:31.164
Yeah, go ahead.

01:02:31.205 --> 01:02:32.290
Hey, Hannah.

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.083
I just quit in protest.

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:35.543
I can't let you do that.

01:02:35.585 --> 01:02:37.378
Kent had no rightto fire you like that,

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:38.671
with no warning?

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:40.298
I don't know what to say.

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:43.301
I just wanted you to know howmuch you mean to your staff.

01:02:43.342 --> 01:02:45.052
I feel the same way.

01:02:45.094 --> 01:02:48.681
Well, that's it.

01:02:48.723 --> 01:02:49.807
Have a good night.

01:02:49.849 --> 01:02:51.267
Bye.

01:02:51.893 --> 01:02:53.936
Who's Hannah.

01:02:53.978 --> 01:02:54.854
My sous chef.

01:02:54.896 --> 01:02:56.898
She just quit her job.

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:58.232
Why would she do that?

01:02:58.274 --> 01:03:01.152
Well, she thought it was unfairthat I got fired.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:02.528
You got fired fromthe restaurant?

01:03:02.570 --> 01:03:04.489
I wasn't happy there.

01:03:04.489 --> 01:03:07.074
Besides, I might have my ownrestaurant tomorrow.

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.451
Just when it seemed thingscouldn't get

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:10.328
any more complicated.

01:03:10.369 --> 01:03:12.747
Maybe we shouldn't talkabout the contest.

01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:15.583
It seems unavoidable.

01:03:15.625 --> 01:03:19.420
How about the unavoidablesubject of you and me?

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.838
You and me?

01:03:20.838 --> 01:03:22.840
I like the sound of that.

01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.676
No matter what happenswe'll be ok.

01:03:25.718 --> 01:03:28.846
I wish you the best tomorrow.

01:03:28.888 --> 01:03:30.431
Maybe second best.

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:31.682
Hmm.

01:03:31.724 --> 01:03:33.100
[laughs]

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:35.478
I wish you the same.

01:03:50.743 --> 01:03:52.453
I thought you went backto New York.

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:55.957
Well, I decided to staya little longer.

01:04:01.170 --> 01:04:01.879
Thanks.

01:04:01.879 --> 01:04:03.422
Yeah, come on in.

01:04:04.006 --> 01:04:05.383
Just breathe.

01:04:07.093 --> 01:04:09.345
So uh, how'sthe show going?

01:04:09.387 --> 01:04:10.972
Uh, well, we're downto two chefs

01:04:11.013 --> 01:04:13.182
so I'm, you know, I'ma little bit rattled,

01:04:13.224 --> 01:04:16.269
but I guess that'spretty obvious.

01:04:16.310 --> 01:04:21.399
Um... so what're you-what're you doing here?

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:26.028
Well, I uh, I thoughtwe could talk.

01:04:26.070 --> 01:04:29.031
Oh, you wanna-right now- ok.

01:04:35.162 --> 01:04:37.206
I'm retiring, Carley.

01:04:37.248 --> 01:04:39.375
I gave my noticeto the restaurant.

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:40.543
Wow.

01:04:40.585 --> 01:04:42.670
Why- uh, why didn'tyou tell me?

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:45.381
Just waiting for the right time.

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:46.882
The uh... the right words.

01:04:46.924 --> 01:04:50.386
I hung up my spatula and tooka good look at my life

01:04:50.428 --> 01:04:53.139
and I want to see moreof my daughter.

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.932
That's why I took the jobin Chicago.

01:04:54.974 --> 01:04:57.935
Wow, that's uh,that's a lot to take in.

01:04:57.977 --> 01:04:59.770
I- I miss you.

01:04:59.770 --> 01:05:01.314
I want you to be in my life.

01:05:01.355 --> 01:05:02.815
I... I

01:05:02.857 --> 01:05:04.275
[laughs]

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:08.446
um, I'm just feeling a little...I don't know how I'm feeling.

01:05:08.487 --> 01:05:09.822
I guess overwhelmed?

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:11.949
Because of the contest.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:13.909
Uh, yeah.

01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:18.539
Carley, I am very proud of you.

01:05:18.581 --> 01:05:20.166
I hope you know that.

01:05:20.207 --> 01:05:24.962
I'm- I'm sorry I haven't saidthat enough.

01:05:24.962 --> 01:05:31.302
Actually, that was a-a first.

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:36.682
Whether you win or loseI'd feel the same way.

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:39.143
I still wanna win.

01:05:40.853 --> 01:05:42.146
[laughs]

01:05:42.146 --> 01:05:45.983
No, it's just... see, this wholetime I thought it was about

01:05:46.025 --> 01:05:50.613
proving myself to youbut I guess I'm the one

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:52.740
that needed the proof.

01:05:53.824 --> 01:05:55.618
Huh.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:57.912
Who knew?

01:05:57.954 --> 01:05:59.372
Hmm.

01:05:59.413 --> 01:06:01.582
So who's the other chef?

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:03.376
His name's Jason.

01:06:03.417 --> 01:06:05.127
The one from the diner.

01:06:05.169 --> 01:06:06.837
Yeah.

01:06:06.879 --> 01:06:08.756
We've gotten pretty close.

01:06:08.798 --> 01:06:11.592
Oh, I see.

01:06:12.176 --> 01:06:13.344
But you know, I mean,having a restaurant,

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:16.806
it's what I've been workingso hard for.

01:06:16.847 --> 01:06:20.935
I look at the choices I madein my life and the times

01:06:20.976 --> 01:06:26.524
I put career before familyand what it cost me

01:06:26.565 --> 01:06:28.567
and I think well, maybe...

01:06:28.609 --> 01:06:31.904
maybe it doesn't have to beone or the other.

01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:36.534
Maybe you can have it all.

01:06:36.575 --> 01:06:40.579
I guess the question is how.

01:06:40.621 --> 01:06:45.459
Yes, well, you know what?

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:48.337
I think you'll figurethat one out.

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:50.715
I've got a lot of faithin you.

01:06:50.756 --> 01:06:53.259
And you should, too.

01:06:53.718 --> 01:06:55.803
I'm really happy you're here.

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:58.723
Oh, me too, honey.

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:00.725
Me too.

01:07:16.282 --> 01:07:17.992
You're late.

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:24.415
Thank you.

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:26.542
The last show's alwaysthe hardest.

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:27.501
You nervous?

01:07:27.543 --> 01:07:28.586
Afraid so.

01:07:28.627 --> 01:07:29.754
Does it show?

01:07:29.795 --> 01:07:30.755
[laughs]

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.590
Well, the finale will airin two months,

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:34.425
right before therestaurant opens.

01:07:34.467 --> 01:07:37.261
It'll be a great send-off.

01:07:37.261 --> 01:07:39.430
I'll give you two a minutebefore we start shooting.

01:07:39.430 --> 01:07:42.266
Thanks.

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:45.061
If you name an emotion,I'm feeling it.

01:07:45.102 --> 01:07:47.063
Me too.

This is the final showdownand there is a lot on the line.

01:08:12.588 --> 01:08:13.839
No pressure.

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:44.537
Suzanne.

01:08:45.912 --> 01:08:47.622
Boys against girls,awesome.

01:08:47.665 --> 01:08:50.000
It's only awesome if you'reon the winning side.

01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.045
Now, this last roundis pretty intense,

01:08:53.087 --> 01:08:54.462
but performing under pressure

01:08:54.505 --> 01:08:56.549
is a vital part of runninga restaurant.

01:08:56.590 --> 01:09:00.051
We wish you boththe best of luck.

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.265
Ok.

01:09:10.645 --> 01:09:13.524
I don't know why each ofyou requires two assistants.

01:09:13.566 --> 01:09:16.609
They always bring back the othercontestants to add to the drama.

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:18.946
Yeah. Just what we need,more drama.

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:20.322
Figure out whatyou're making.

01:09:20.363 --> 01:09:21.532
That's half the battle.

01:09:21.532 --> 01:09:22.950
I hate to think of itas a battle.

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:26.036
Don't let your fondness forCarley get the better of you.

01:09:26.036 --> 01:09:28.247
It's a cooking show,not a dating show.

01:09:28.288 --> 01:09:29.497
Concentrate on your cooking.

01:09:29.540 --> 01:09:31.584
Hey, she and Jasoncan still be friends.

01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:34.211
They can do whatever they want,after she wins.

01:09:34.211 --> 01:09:35.421
Ok, can we talk aboutsomething else

01:09:35.462 --> 01:09:36.671
'cause this is not helping.

01:09:36.714 --> 01:09:37.506
Ok.

01:09:37.548 --> 01:09:38.299
Ok.

01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:40.843
What're you gonna make?

01:09:40.885 --> 01:09:43.136
I don't know.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:47.140
I need to talk to Carley.

01:09:47.182 --> 01:09:50.019
Maybe you should keepyour distance.

01:09:52.563 --> 01:09:54.940
I wish it were that simple.

01:10:11.123 --> 01:10:15.711
[both sigh]

01:10:19.423 --> 01:10:21.383
This is harder than I thoughtit was going to be.

01:10:21.425 --> 01:10:23.219
Yeah.

01:10:23.260 --> 01:10:25.220
I really wanna win.

01:10:25.262 --> 01:10:26.430
That makes two of us.

01:10:26.472 --> 01:10:29.225
Actually, it makes six of us.

01:10:29.266 --> 01:10:33.354
Our sous chefs arepretty invested.

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:40.069
What do you supposethey're doing in there?

01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:42.279
Are they kissing or competing?

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:44.281
The Romeo and Julietof the kitchen.

01:10:44.323 --> 01:10:47.993
It's a nice story, but look outfor that ending.

01:10:53.874 --> 01:10:56.752
What do you thinkyou're gonna make?

01:10:56.794 --> 01:10:59.046
I haven't decided yet.

01:10:59.088 --> 01:11:04.635
It seems that the choice isas important as the execution.

01:11:04.677 --> 01:11:06.345
How about you?

01:11:06.387 --> 01:11:08.681
Chicken Cordon Bleu.

01:11:09.306 --> 01:11:10.975
Hey.

01:11:10.975 --> 01:11:12.601
Trust your talent.

01:11:12.643 --> 01:11:13.811
Believe in yourself.

01:11:13.852 --> 01:11:17.648
Be bold.

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:19.608
That's really kind of youto say that,

01:11:19.650 --> 01:11:21.735
especially underthe circumstances.

01:11:21.777 --> 01:11:22.695
Thank you.

01:11:22.736 --> 01:11:24.196
Yeah.

01:11:25.322 --> 01:11:26.782
Ok.

01:11:37.918 --> 01:11:39.962
I hate to interrupt...

01:11:40.004 --> 01:11:43.132
I think we arrivedin the nick of time.

01:11:44.008 --> 01:11:46.093
It's time to start cooking.

01:11:51.849 --> 01:11:53.434
Jason's gifted.

01:11:53.475 --> 01:11:55.936
I say that with envyand admiration.

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:57.896
The thing is, I like the guy.

01:11:57.938 --> 01:12:01.400
I'm not knocking his achievementfrom diner to runner-up,

01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:03.027
but Carley is the better chef.

01:12:03.068 --> 01:12:05.696
I guess we'll find outsoon enough.

01:12:07.364 --> 01:12:11.869
Look at these exquisite trufflesJason is using in his sauce.

01:12:11.910 --> 01:12:14.079
Truffles?

01:12:14.121 --> 01:12:15.289
Like any great chef,

01:12:15.331 --> 01:12:18.751
Jason knows the importanceof the best ingredients.

01:12:24.381 --> 01:12:27.384
Alright, don't fail me now.

01:12:27.426 --> 01:12:29.303
I want to start with Arboriorice to make sure

01:12:29.345 --> 01:12:31.055
that it has enough timeto absorb all the flavours

01:12:31.055 --> 01:12:33.182
and then move on to the trufflesauce we talked about.

01:12:33.223 --> 01:12:34.099
Am I talking too fast?

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:35.309
I'm talking too fast,aren't I?

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:37.394
Jason is making a truffle saucefor his dish.

01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:38.395
What?

01:12:38.437 --> 01:12:39.730
He told me he was makingChicken Cordon Bleu.

01:12:39.772 --> 01:12:40.898
Apparently, it wasn't true.

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:42.483
Well, there must besome sort of mistake.

01:12:42.524 --> 01:12:44.193
Maybe he's trying to stealyour ideas.

01:12:44.234 --> 01:12:46.028
I can't believe thathe would do that,

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:46.904
we're friends.

01:12:46.945 --> 01:12:48.030
Unless he's been playing you.

01:12:48.072 --> 01:12:50.449
No, Suzanne, you're wrong.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:52.201
You can't havetwo truffle dishes.

01:12:52.242 --> 01:12:54.745
At least let me seewhat I can find out.

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:02.294
Jason is using trufflesin his dish.

01:13:02.336 --> 01:13:03.420
What is he making?

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.547
That's what we needto find out.

01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:07.966
Ok.

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:16.266
So uh, how're you guys doing?

01:13:16.266 --> 01:13:17.226
Ok.

01:13:17.267 --> 01:13:18.477
What's Jason making here?

01:13:18.519 --> 01:13:21.647
Let's not confidein the opposition.

01:13:27.778 --> 01:13:29.905
Tina said Winston saidPeter shouldn't tell her

01:13:29.947 --> 01:13:30.989
what Jason is making.

01:13:31.031 --> 01:13:32.157
I don't understand.

01:13:32.199 --> 01:13:34.201
I don't understand why he wouldchange his dish.

01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:38.622
It's brave of you to make sucha complex dish.

01:13:38.622 --> 01:13:40.791
My dad is gonna love it.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:43.836
It's a tribute to himand all he's given me.

01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:47.005
Keep your eye on the prize.

01:13:47.047 --> 01:13:49.425
Don't let anything throw you.

01:13:52.970 --> 01:13:53.887
Everything ok?

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:54.972
I don't know.

01:13:54.972 --> 01:13:56.140
You tell me.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.268
Well, I wouldn't say I'm okbut I'm holding up.

01:13:59.309 --> 01:14:01.186
That's not what I meant.

01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:03.814
Okay, guys, we're aboutto resume shooting.

01:14:10.028 --> 01:14:11.488
You're wearingyour game face.

01:14:11.488 --> 01:14:14.241
It's a very pretty face even ifyour intention is to beat me.

01:14:14.283 --> 01:14:16.285
You're really gonna try to flirtwith me at a time like this?

01:14:16.326 --> 01:14:17.703
I'm just trying to lightenthings up a bit.

01:14:17.744 --> 01:14:20.330
Why did you change your dishat the last minute?

01:14:20.330 --> 01:14:21.582
Is that what this is about?

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:23.667
What're you making?

01:14:23.709 --> 01:14:25.502
Lobster ravioliin a truffle sauce.

01:14:25.502 --> 01:14:28.422
I'm making shrimpand truffle risotto.

01:14:28.463 --> 01:14:30.841
Woah, do you think I'm tryingto copy your dish?

01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:33.844
I don't know.

01:14:33.886 --> 01:14:35.345
I thought you knew mebetter than that.

01:14:35.345 --> 01:14:37.723
Yeah, so did I.

01:14:50.027 --> 01:14:50.944
You're running out of time.

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:52.279
I don't wanna drown the ravioli.

01:14:52.321 --> 01:14:53.947
You have to start platingyour food.

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:55.324
I need my crunchyscallion garnish.

01:14:55.365 --> 01:14:57.743
Forget it, you don'thave time.

01:14:57.784 --> 01:14:59.620
Ten seconds.

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:01.663
It has to be right.

01:15:02.247 --> 01:15:03.457
Got the scallion.

01:15:03.498 --> 01:15:04.541
Hurry up.

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:05.876
Almost there.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:07.753
Five,

01:15:07.794 --> 01:15:09.546
four,

01:15:09.546 --> 01:15:11.548
three,

01:15:11.548 --> 01:15:13.050
two...

01:15:13.050 --> 01:15:15.427
One. Time's up.

01:15:15.469 --> 01:15:19.306
One of your lives isabout to change forever.

01:15:21.099 --> 01:15:23.602
The judges will now deliberate.

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.653
Pretty soon thiswill all be over.

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:33.737
Are you talking aboutthe competition,

01:15:33.737 --> 01:15:35.864
or you and me?

01:15:37.157 --> 01:15:39.493
You told me to trust myself.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:44.164
Um... you guys can takea break

01:15:44.206 --> 01:15:47.000
before we start shootingthe final segment.

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.380
Car...

01:15:51.421 --> 01:15:52.422
What's going on?

01:15:52.422 --> 01:15:54.550
You should go after her.

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:03.475
Go, go! Find outwhat happens.

01:16:03.517 --> 01:16:05.644
Ok. Come on, let's go.

01:16:09.189 --> 01:16:10.941
I just wanna say...

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.196
Ok, I have no ideawhat to say.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:17.948
No, I can't do thisright now.

01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:20.409
Ok, this needs to bebetween Carley and I.

01:16:20.450 --> 01:16:21.285
Come on.

01:16:21.326 --> 01:16:23.078
Beverly sent me,it wasn't my idea.

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.205
Tell her you couldn'tfind us.

01:16:25.247 --> 01:16:27.207
Ok, cut it.

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:33.797
I want you to know something.

01:16:33.797 --> 01:16:37.676
I changed my dish because youtold me to believe in myself,

01:16:37.718 --> 01:16:39.553
and that meant my history.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.805
Truffles in a diner?

01:16:43.974 --> 01:16:48.854
Ok... you remember that storymy dad told?

01:16:48.895 --> 01:16:50.814
He took me to the bestrestaurant in the city

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:57.279
when I was 15 so I couldappreciate good food.

01:16:57.321 --> 01:17:02.784
I made the dish he orderedthat night as a tribute to him,

01:17:02.826 --> 01:17:06.955
and to the chef he couldhave been.

01:17:08.540 --> 01:17:10.792
My dish was a tributeto my dad.

01:17:10.834 --> 01:17:12.794
We used to makerisotto together.

01:17:12.836 --> 01:17:14.338
That's why I picked it.

01:17:14.379 --> 01:17:16.214
So we're good?

01:17:16.256 --> 01:17:18.967
Because losing you would beharder than losing this contest.

01:17:19.009 --> 01:17:20.844
We're great.

01:17:20.844 --> 01:17:23.847
I am so sorry thatI doubted you.

01:17:29.561 --> 01:17:30.979
[knocking]

01:17:31.021 --> 01:17:32.022
Hey.

01:17:32.022 --> 01:17:35.108
They're ready to shootthe judges' verdict.

01:17:43.700 --> 01:17:45.827
Ok, this is it.

01:17:45.869 --> 01:17:47.454
The final showdown.

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:51.041
You have both proven yourselvesmaking it this far.

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:55.212
Now we have to pick a winner.

01:17:55.212 --> 01:17:57.923
Your dishes hadsimilar components

01:17:57.964 --> 01:18:01.093
but both were uniquein their own way.

01:18:03.345 --> 01:18:04.971
In the end...

01:18:06.765 --> 01:18:11.228
I found Carley's risottoto be the superior dish.

01:18:15.065 --> 01:18:17.484
Both of you have surpassedmy expectations,

01:18:17.526 --> 01:18:21.363
but Jason's ravioli,that extraordinary sauce,

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:23.407
I had to give it my vote.

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:25.283
Thank you, chef.

01:18:25.325 --> 01:18:26.493
Well, I hate when this happens.

01:18:26.535 --> 01:18:28.912
Now I have to break the tie.

01:18:28.912 --> 01:18:29.913
[small laugh]

01:18:29.913 --> 01:18:31.915
We need your decision, Nora.

01:18:31.915 --> 01:18:34.251
Look, you're both very talentedand deserving

01:18:34.292 --> 01:18:37.212
of your own restaurant, but Ikeep going back and forth.

01:18:37.254 --> 01:18:41.591
Carley's risotto is just superb,but so is the ravioli.

01:18:41.633 --> 01:18:44.928
I'm having a really tough timemaking a choice.

01:18:44.928 --> 01:18:46.763
We make each otherbetter chefs.

01:18:46.763 --> 01:18:48.265
Yes, we do.

01:18:48.306 --> 01:18:50.809
That's what's reallyimportant to me.

01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:53.770
Me too.

01:18:55.772 --> 01:18:59.317
Why can't we open a restauranttogether?

01:19:06.032 --> 01:19:07.367
Wow.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:09.786
A tie has neverhappened before.

01:19:09.786 --> 01:19:12.414
I would be honoured to sharea kitchen with you.

01:19:12.456 --> 01:19:13.290
Yeah?

01:19:13.290 --> 01:19:14.207
Yeah.

01:19:14.249 --> 01:19:15.417
I don't think we can allow it.

01:19:15.459 --> 01:19:18.044
That would break precedent.I'm on the fence.

01:19:18.086 --> 01:19:22.215
I'm backing this restaurantand I think it could work.
