00:37.540 --> 00:39.045
Sergeant gabriel,priority homicide.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.150
I'm just looking for
someone. She's right there.

00:41.185 --> 00:42.335
I'll be one second.

00:42.370 --> 00:44.430
Excuse me. Just one second.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.985
The winds changed.

00:54.020 --> 00:55.640
Fire's coming this way.

00:56.120 --> 00:58.910
And we have company outside.

00:59.480 --> 01:00.360
Okay.

01:03.440 --> 01:03.975
Pardon me.

01:04.010 --> 01:05.770
- Excuse me, guys.
- Sorry.

01:15.200 --> 01:15.845
Chief pope.

01:15.880 --> 01:17.310
Commander taylor.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.595
Deputy chief johnson,sergeant gabriel...

01:19.630 --> 01:21.315
this is ricardo ramos from the times.

01:21.350 --> 01:25.490
He's gonna be trailing priority
homicide's investigation.

01:26.350 --> 01:27.880
Nice to meet you,chief johnson.

01:27.915 --> 01:29.070
Sergeant gabriel.

01:30.850 --> 01:32.005
Uh, pardon me.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.415
Ricardo, would you mind

01:33.450 --> 01:34.700
waiting over there by the bodies

01:34.735 --> 01:35.950
for just one moment, please?

01:35.985 --> 01:37.412
Thank you so much.

01:37.447 --> 01:38.840
Uh, yeah. All right.

01:43.450 --> 01:44.690
Four people are dead.

01:44.725 --> 01:45.895
The fire isn't contained.

01:45.930 --> 01:47.230
This entire command center has to move.

01:47.265 --> 01:48.677
The last thing I need right now

01:48.712 --> 01:50.055
is a reporter following me around.

01:50.090 --> 01:52.790
She already agreed to a media
presence on her next case.

01:52.825 --> 01:54.670
If it were a regular homicide,

01:54.705 --> 01:56.435
yes, but it's not.

01:56.470 --> 01:57.585
I can't get anywhere near the fire,

01:57.620 --> 01:59.805
and the incident commander
won't even talk to me.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.990
Yeah, that's because you're
not supposed to be here.

02:02.025 --> 02:03.225
What? Why not?

02:03.260 --> 02:05.795
Because before a fire is contained,

02:05.830 --> 02:08.330
L.A.P.D. usually just directs traffic,

02:08.365 --> 02:10.370
manages civilian evacuations,

02:10.405 --> 02:11.505
tows cars away.

02:11.540 --> 02:12.785
They let you badge your way up here,

02:12.820 --> 02:14.740
but we don't even know
if this is an arson yet.

02:14.775 --> 02:16.377
There are no electrical wires

02:16.412 --> 02:17.945
near the fire's anchor point,

02:17.980 --> 02:20.300
so the fire is probably
of human origin, sir.

02:20.335 --> 02:22.480
Which makes this a massive crime scene.

02:22.515 --> 02:23.465
It's just massive.

02:23.500 --> 02:24.680
So, what are you saying -

02:24.715 --> 02:25.947
this case is too big for you?

02:25.982 --> 02:27.176
No, I'm saying it's too big

02:27.211 --> 02:28.335
for five fire departments,

02:28.370 --> 02:30.250
nine fire engines,four helicopters,

02:30.285 --> 02:31.610
and I don't know what all.

02:33.240 --> 02:34.635
It's not a murder anymore.

02:34.670 --> 02:35.995
It's a natural disaster.

02:36.030 --> 02:39.180
Would you ask me to babysit
a reporter during a hurricane?

02:39.215 --> 02:41.267
People don't start hurricanes.

02:41.302 --> 02:43.320
Hurricanes are not crimes.

02:45.040 --> 02:46.790
Taylor, tell the incident
commander we're leaving.

02:46.825 --> 02:47.315
Sergeant gabriel,

02:47.350 --> 02:48.250
tell lieutenant provenza

02:48.300 --> 02:51.370
I want the team back down on
los feliz boulevard... now.

02:51.405 --> 02:54.290
We have an injured
firefighter and another victim!

02:58.950 --> 03:00.365
Get that camera guy out of here.

03:00.400 --> 03:01.735
- Get him out of here.
- Get out of here.

03:01.770 --> 03:02.980
- Hey, I got a pass. I can be here.
- I don't care.

03:03.015 --> 03:05.110
Take it easy. Take
it easy. He's with us.

03:05.145 --> 03:06.270
Please move.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.885
You know, I should have the
authority to reject journalists

03:08.920 --> 03:11.540
if I think that they're going to
get in the way of my investigation.

03:11.575 --> 03:13.570
Okay, authority. What
about my authority?

03:13.605 --> 03:15.485
I get orders, too, okay?

03:15.520 --> 03:18.180
And mine were absolutely
clear in this case -

03:18.215 --> 03:20.840
improve relations between
L.A.P.D. And the media.

03:20.875 --> 03:21.885
That is what I am doing.

03:21.920 --> 03:23.525
Commander taylor is assisting me,

03:23.560 --> 03:26.150
and I expect your
enthusiastic cooperation.

03:26.185 --> 03:27.122
Fine, will. Whatever you want.

03:27.157 --> 03:28.025
Besides, it's a big story.

03:28.060 --> 03:29.580
We'd rather have him
reporting it from inside

03:29.615 --> 03:31.105
than guessing from out on the street.

03:31.140 --> 03:32.995
He might even prove to
be an asset of some -

03:33.030 --> 03:34.850
oh, yes, journalists
- they're so helpful.

03:34.885 --> 03:36.365
We'll want them on every case.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.060
Okay, I take it this is
your attempt at enthusiasm.

03:38.095 --> 03:40.800
I'm sorry. I meant to say "yippee. "

03:41.730 --> 03:42.780
Sergeant.

03:43.900 --> 03:45.360
Let's go, lieutenant. Let's go, go, go.

03:45.395 --> 03:46.760
Okay, guys,we got to go.

03:46.795 --> 03:48.192
We're ordered out.

03:48.227 --> 03:49.590
Come on, kids.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.110
All right, buzz,let's
cover all our bases.

04:14.145 --> 04:15.805
Get as many faces in
the crowd as you can.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.380
Check and see if anyone's
admiring their handiwork?

04:17.415 --> 04:18.339
You got it.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.760
Chief, our victims -

04:22.390 --> 04:23.675
we got two firemen...

04:23.710 --> 04:25.825
one from burbank,one from county.

04:25.860 --> 04:27.955
Got a hiker -connie miranda.

04:27.990 --> 04:29.950
She got trapped in a canyon.

04:29.985 --> 04:31.910
And then a guy golfing -

04:31.945 --> 04:33.535
richard gordon.

04:33.570 --> 04:36.500
He ran the wrong way off the sixth hole.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.725
That's a guy who could use a mulligan.

04:38.760 --> 04:41.895
Lieutenant provenza, this is
ricardo ramos of the times.

04:41.930 --> 04:45.030
Lieutenant provenza is chief
johnson's second-in-command.

04:45.065 --> 04:46.747
- Nice to meet
you, sir. - Uh-huh.

04:46.782 --> 04:48.430
What about the other woman found?

04:48.465 --> 04:50.605
D.O.A. -Burnt, no I.D.

04:50.640 --> 04:52.240
The fire was started in
the middle of the park.

04:52.275 --> 04:53.615
Anyone caught running out?

04:53.650 --> 04:56.100
Not so far, but how an
arsonist could escape this place

04:56.135 --> 04:57.950
after we surrounded it,I don't know.

04:57.985 --> 05:00.160
Lieutenant flynn,ricardo ramos.

05:00.195 --> 05:01.225
Yeah, I met him...

05:01.260 --> 05:03.110
when he was taking
pictures of the dead girl.

05:03.145 --> 05:04.070
I thought it was a rescue.

05:04.105 --> 05:05.175
Rescue?

05:05.210 --> 05:06.245
Considering how bad she looked,

05:06.280 --> 05:08.170
I'm surprised they
brought her back at all.

05:08.205 --> 05:10.182
Well, unless stuff is
falling out of the body,

05:10.217 --> 05:12.160
firefighters always
bring the victims back.

05:12.195 --> 05:13.127
She was found near a canyon

05:13.162 --> 05:14.025
where the homeless hang out.

05:14.060 --> 05:15.990
Might explain why she had no I.D.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.260
Here. Let me help you with that.

05:17.295 --> 05:18.542
I have it. I'll get it.

05:18.577 --> 05:19.790
I said I have it, sergeant.

05:19.825 --> 05:21.050
Thank you.

05:27.050 --> 05:28.340
right behind the tape.

05:28.375 --> 05:29.692
Where did he go?

05:29.727 --> 05:31.010
Where did wh

05:39.000 --> 05:40.680
That's bill croelick.

05:42.630 --> 05:43.930
Gentlemen...

05:44.100 --> 05:46.410
would you please catch
up with bill croelick

05:46.445 --> 05:47.720
and invite him downtown?

05:50.810 --> 05:52.320
Who's bill croelick?

05:53.220 --> 05:54.555
He's a pyromaniac

05:54.590 --> 05:56.270
who uses alcoholic beverages

05:56.305 --> 05:57.915
to set his girlfriends on fire.

05:57.950 --> 05:59.880
He likes the smell of burning flesh.

06:01.730 --> 06:03.385
Why isn't he in jail?

06:03.420 --> 06:06.120
We arrested croelick for murder twice,

06:06.155 --> 06:08.687
but our chief witness against him

06:08.722 --> 06:10.706
at the first trial disappeared,

06:10.741 --> 06:12.655
and he was found not guilty.

06:12.690 --> 06:13.990
We got a conviction in another murder

06:14.025 --> 06:15.652
and put croelick on death row.

06:15.687 --> 06:17.280
But, unfortunately,he was framed

06:17.315 --> 06:18.925
in that particular killing.

06:18.960 --> 06:21.405
So now croelick has a huge lawsuit

06:21.440 --> 06:24.340
pending against the state
for wrongful imprisonment.

06:24.680 --> 06:26.935
Almost settled, and we
wouldn't want to disrupt that.

06:26.970 --> 06:29.190
But if croelick is a person
of interest in this fire,

06:29.225 --> 06:30.940
that's something I'd like to run with.

06:34.040 --> 06:35.495
This may surprise you,ricardo,

06:35.530 --> 06:37.830
but when a newspaper announces
we're looking for people,

06:37.865 --> 06:39.990
it sometimes makes them harder to find.

06:41.550 --> 06:43.265
Just playing devil's
advocate for one moment -

06:43.300 --> 06:45.880
by running a picture of this
guy's face on the front page

06:45.915 --> 06:47.137
is gonna make him a
little more recogni-

06:47.172 --> 06:48.325
you run that picture in your newspaper,

06:48.360 --> 06:50.690
and later on, it turns out
that someone saw croelick

06:50.725 --> 06:52.270
in griffith park striking a match,

06:52.305 --> 06:53.535
his lawyer will say that

06:53.570 --> 06:56.650
our witness I.D.'D croelick from
that photograph in your paper.

06:56.685 --> 07:00.020
Besides, you can't refer to
croelick as a known arsonist.

07:00.055 --> 07:01.997
He wasn't convicted as an adult,

07:02.032 --> 07:03.940
and his juvenile record is sealed.

07:03.975 --> 07:04.915
But if it were opened,

07:04.950 --> 07:06.515
you could read about how croelick

07:06.550 --> 07:08.080
branded his name on a girl's arm

07:08.115 --> 07:10.040
during sexual intercourse.

07:13.440 --> 07:15.975
Now, listen to me,ricardo,

07:16.010 --> 07:17.705
because I've interviewed mr. Croelick

07:17.740 --> 07:19.690
and I suggested that
he might be a killer.

07:19.725 --> 07:20.975
And the next night,when I got home,

07:21.010 --> 07:23.430
I found him waiting for
me on my front porch.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.210
He has a habit of doing
that when he's irritated -

07:26.245 --> 07:29.182
just turning up out of the blue...

07:29.217 --> 07:32.120
in the dark, when you're all alone.

07:35.560 --> 07:37.950
So, you run with that
picture,and here's what happens.

07:37.985 --> 07:39.992
You lose all access to the L.A.P.D.,

07:40.027 --> 07:42.000
And while we're looking for croelick,

07:42.035 --> 07:43.880
croelick is looking for you.

07:44.810 --> 07:46.770
Hello,lieutenant provenza.

07:47.280 --> 07:48.375
Uh, no.

07:48.410 --> 07:50.025
Have lieutenant flynn

07:50.060 --> 07:53.230
and detective sanchez put
some undercover people together

07:53.265 --> 07:55.560
to watch croelick's
apartment in case he shows up.

07:55.595 --> 07:57.215
Thank you so much.

07:57.250 --> 07:59.055
What happens if croelick
lights up malibu,

07:59.090 --> 08:01.420
and we withheld a picture that
could have helped stop him?

08:01.455 --> 08:02.367
A better question would be,

08:02.402 --> 08:03.245
what if you run the story

08:03.280 --> 08:05.990
and it turns out croelick had nothing
to do with the griffith park fire

08:06.025 --> 08:07.900
and he takes an instant dislike to you?

08:07.935 --> 08:08.975
Let's put it this way.

08:09.010 --> 08:11.080
Ricardo, you have two
excellent opportunities

08:11.115 --> 08:13.180
of visiting the county morgue this week,

08:13.215 --> 08:15.310
and one of them is with me.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.425
I see dead people -

08:25.460 --> 08:28.025
lots and lots of dead people.

08:28.060 --> 08:30.590
Two smoked,two extra-crispy,

08:30.870 --> 08:35.030
and then, this lady here -

08:35.390 --> 08:37.169
The combo platter.

08:37.919 --> 08:39.659
First time at the morgue?

08:39.695 --> 08:41.246
Mm-hmm. Gracias.

08:41.282 --> 08:42.765
You're welcome.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.039
Should I act like he's not here?

08:44.075 --> 08:45.587
That's what I'm trying to do.

08:45.622 --> 08:47.100
Just go ahead, doctor,please.

08:47.135 --> 08:48.645
Okay, this lady -

08:48.680 --> 08:50.020
I was told she might be homeless,

08:50.055 --> 08:52.275
but I don't think so.

08:52.310 --> 08:54.230
Not only does she have all her teeth,

08:54.265 --> 08:56.150
but, also,they've just been bleached.

08:56.510 --> 08:58.370
How are you holding up there,ricardo?

08:58.405 --> 08:59.615
Yeah, I'm fine.

08:59.650 --> 09:00.825
Then there's the victim's clothes.

09:00.860 --> 09:03.850
She was wearing a rayon
dress over a cotton t-shirt.

09:03.885 --> 09:04.915
Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

09:04.950 --> 09:08.150
Are you suggesting that she
dressed for the occasion?

09:08.185 --> 09:10.892
In two highly flammable materials.

09:10.927 --> 09:13.243
And no smoke damage to her lungs.

09:13.278 --> 09:15.560
She died before the fire started.

09:16.280 --> 09:19.250
From a pretty serious blow to the skull,

09:19.285 --> 09:22.220
and then she was torched afterwards.

09:22.255 --> 09:23.725
And I say torched

09:23.760 --> 09:26.160
because her hair, her body,her clothes

09:26.195 --> 09:28.480
were drenched in alcohol.

09:30.410 --> 09:33.430
I may be able to rehydrate the hand.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.060
I don't know.

09:35.990 --> 09:37.620
Well, she's not as far gone
as I would have thought,

09:37.655 --> 09:39.160
considering the circumstances.

09:39.195 --> 09:41.000
What?What circumstances?

09:41.210 --> 09:44.300
If you're looking for the
epicenter of your fire,

09:44.335 --> 09:47.390
I think she might be
right here on my gurney.

09:56.470 --> 09:57.990
What a cute cat.

09:58.380 --> 10:00.350
How did you know I have a cat?

10:02.580 --> 10:03.565
Yes, I have a cat,

10:03.600 --> 10:06.210
but that is 100% off the record.

10:13.940 --> 10:15.980
Oh, kitty!

10:16.330 --> 10:20.330
Hey, news says your
fire's 90% contained.

10:22.760 --> 10:26.340
Sorry. I was trying to
spot smoke this morning.

10:26.375 --> 10:28.070
- So I must have, um
- right.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.300
Hello.

10:29.760 --> 10:33.690
This is ricardo ramos from the times.

10:33.725 --> 10:35.355
He's covering the fire.

10:35.390 --> 10:37.820
Ricardo, my fianc?Fritz howard.

10:37.855 --> 10:38.675
Fianc?

10:38.710 --> 10:40.865
When's the happy day?

10:40.900 --> 10:42.375
As soon as we buy a house.

10:42.410 --> 10:43.850
Oh, you're moving out?

10:43.885 --> 10:45.150
In.

10:45.860 --> 10:46.725
Yesterday?

10:46.760 --> 10:48.090
Six weeks ago.

10:48.125 --> 10:49.385
It's temporary.

10:49.420 --> 10:51.120
- I had a bungalow.
- We had.

10:51.155 --> 10:53.677
We had a bungalow that I sold...

10:53.712 --> 10:55.566
- We sold...
- We sold, and, um...

10:55.601 --> 10:57.420
Then the house prices got weird,

10:57.455 --> 10:59.555
and so we decided to rent.

10:59.590 --> 11:02.020
And the landlord said
absolutely, positively no pets,

11:02.055 --> 11:04.950
so please don't mention
kitty in your article.

11:04.985 --> 11:06.280
Thank you.

11:07.020 --> 11:08.665
Excuse me one moment,

11:08.700 --> 11:11.065
and then we will go to the hospital

11:11.100 --> 11:13.440
and see if we can talk
to the firefighters.

11:13.810 --> 11:15.010
Honey?

11:21.550 --> 11:22.845
You can't leave the curtains open.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.105
Someone is going to see kitty,

11:24.140 --> 11:25.780
and then there will be big, big trouble.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.237
We can't meet the upstairs neighbor

11:27.272 --> 11:28.625
because the landlord said no pets.

11:28.660 --> 11:31.450
We have to keep the curtains
closed 24 hours a day

11:31.485 --> 11:33.262
because the landlord said no pets.

11:33.297 --> 11:35.018
It's like living with anne frank.

11:35.053 --> 11:36.740
Were you able to fix the toilets?

11:37.760 --> 11:38.775
No, I'm sorry.

11:38.810 --> 11:42.110
Oh, how many more mornings are we
gonna be rushing to work to pee?

11:42.145 --> 11:43.895
Just please call a plumber. Please.

11:43.930 --> 11:47.340
The landlord should be responsible
for fixing the bathrooms.

11:47.580 --> 11:49.180
That's one of the upsides of renting.

11:49.215 --> 11:50.780
If you let me talk to the landlord...

11:50.815 --> 11:51.865
No. No. No.

11:51.900 --> 11:53.105
Kitty stuff everywhere.

11:53.140 --> 11:54.820
Okay, fine. If you really
have to use the bathroom,

11:54.855 --> 11:56.972
go upstairs and meet the neighbor.

11:57.007 --> 11:59.090
Ask her if you can use her bathroom.

11:59.840 --> 12:01.680
That's not how I want to meet her.

12:06.640 --> 12:07.720
Hey, wait a minute.

12:08.360 --> 12:11.415
Is that why you're still
here, drinking coffee?

12:11.450 --> 12:13.550
You went upstairs to the neighbor's
and asked to use her bathroom?

12:13.585 --> 12:14.957
No, I took a shower.

12:14.992 --> 12:16.330
What does that mean?

12:17.760 --> 12:20.340
You peed in the -

12:20.700 --> 12:23.305
- Gross!Gross!
- Oh, for god's sake.

12:23.340 --> 12:26.330
- Everything went right down the drain.
- And completely unfair.

12:26.365 --> 12:28.890
Never do that again. Never!

12:30.900 --> 12:32.475
We both have to use that shower,

12:32.510 --> 12:34.015
and I'm not getting back in there

12:34.050 --> 12:37.040
until you scrub,
scrub, scrub every tile.

12:37.075 --> 12:40.280
Just, please, call the plumber.

12:41.290 --> 12:44.090
I... I need this place
to be more manageable.

12:44.750 --> 12:46.900
Oh, why do you sit in the window?

12:46.935 --> 12:48.800
Bad kitty!Bad!

12:49.070 --> 12:51.800
Oh, I need to get to the hospital.

13:00.210 --> 13:02.600
Ricardo said he'd find you later.

13:03.700 --> 13:07.290
You know, you might feel less all
"over the place" if you unpacked.

13:07.325 --> 13:09.900
And then just have to box
it all up again when we move.

13:09.935 --> 13:12.020
I can't even think about that.

13:14.540 --> 13:15.950
This fire.

13:20.390 --> 13:22.890
Where is my brown sweater?

13:25.380 --> 13:29.030
Just please call the plumber. Please.

13:29.065 --> 13:30.510
I will deal with it.

13:32.390 --> 13:33.560
Thank you.

13:40.190 --> 13:42.140
Chief... Chief...

13:42.320 --> 13:43.355
This way.

13:43.390 --> 13:45.410
So, the fire is still burning.

13:45.445 --> 13:47.427
Croelick is still at large.

13:47.462 --> 13:49.375
Jane doe is still unidentified,

13:49.410 --> 13:51.970
although I talked to all of
the firefighters involved,

13:52.005 --> 13:54.860
except for the guy that found her
- tom merrick.

13:54.895 --> 13:56.467
He's recovering from smoke inhalation.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.005
His wife stepped out to call her family,

13:58.040 --> 14:00.550
but she said that he is up
and that we can talk to him

14:00.585 --> 14:02.337
if it's absolutely necessary.

14:02.372 --> 14:04.090
Well, of course it's necessary.

14:04.125 --> 14:05.640
Thank you, david.

14:06.840 --> 14:08.460
Anything else I should know?

14:09.560 --> 14:10.235
Not really.

14:10.270 --> 14:14.840
Because if there's a problem in your
relationship with detective daniels...

14:16.440 --> 14:19.110
No. No. No, no. No, no, not at all.

14:19.145 --> 14:20.620
Oh, thank goodness.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.000
'Cause I really couldn't
handle that right now.

14:23.035 --> 14:24.775
Yeah. Yeah.

14:24.810 --> 14:26.975
Okay. Gentlemen, pardon me.

14:27.010 --> 14:28.970
- Thanks, guys.
- Thank you.

14:29.005 --> 14:30.930
I think she was right about here.

14:30.965 --> 14:32.395
How'd you find her?

14:32.430 --> 14:34.260
Well, we were looking for her.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.720
I mean, we thought somebody
might be up where we found her.

14:37.755 --> 14:40.530
There's a small canyon
where the homeless hang out.

14:41.150 --> 14:43.850
When the brush-burn index goes
up, we have to clear them out.

14:43.885 --> 14:44.875
Why?

14:44.910 --> 14:46.780
Well, they start cooking fires.

14:46.815 --> 14:49.047
We'd just chased them off

14:49.082 --> 14:51.280
the day before yesterday.

14:51.660 --> 14:54.390
Usually, they don't
come back for a month.

14:55.200 --> 14:55.775
There's this one guy.

14:55.810 --> 14:58.640
He got... mad at us, you know?

14:58.675 --> 15:00.472
He was a little weird.

15:00.507 --> 15:02.270
What did he look like?

15:03.890 --> 15:06.580
He had a baseball cap
pulled down over his face.

15:08.310 --> 15:10.730
He hadn't shaved for a few days.

15:10.765 --> 15:12.592
He didn't feel homeless,

15:12.627 --> 15:14.420
if you know what I mean.

15:15.620 --> 15:17.105
Sorry to bother you at, uh...

15:17.140 --> 15:18.620
Listen, I walk out of
here tomorrow morning.

15:18.655 --> 15:19.810
Two of our firefighters are dead,

15:19.845 --> 15:21.310
so bother me, sergeant.

15:21.345 --> 15:22.495
Yes, sir.

15:22.530 --> 15:26.610
Uh, anyone resemble your guy?

15:31.590 --> 15:33.850
Take your time, tom. Be sure.

15:34.830 --> 15:38.400
Sorry. I... I try not
to look at those people.

15:40.590 --> 15:42.840
You know, when I heard
where the fire was...

15:43.670 --> 15:45.830
When they mobilized
the whole department,

15:45.865 --> 15:47.990
I thought of that creepy
guy, and I wondered.

15:53.960 --> 15:56.850
Any idea how someone could start
a fire in that part of the park

15:56.885 --> 15:59.200
and then disappear
before we sealed it off?

16:00.770 --> 16:02.860
Maybe he didn't get out.

16:03.500 --> 16:06.205
Maybe you'll find another body up there.

16:06.240 --> 16:09.210
You know, arsonists usually aren't
the brightest people on earth.

16:10.430 --> 16:13.100
So, you think it was one of these guys?

16:13.800 --> 16:15.660
Don't worry about them, tom.

16:16.630 --> 16:18.075
You did your job.

16:18.110 --> 16:19.520
Now let us do ours.

16:21.310 --> 16:24.150
Homeless, unshaven guy
wearing a cap in hollywood -

16:24.185 --> 16:25.385
that narrows it down.

16:25.420 --> 16:26.845
It could have been croelick.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.720
We think he likes to pick
people he thinks won't be missed.

16:29.755 --> 16:31.495
Except I don't think
our victim was homeless.

16:31.530 --> 16:35.090
I think she was put somewhere where
homeless people are known to go.

16:36.340 --> 16:37.890
What did we hear from
the fire department?

16:37.925 --> 16:39.795
95% containment.

16:39.830 --> 16:44.330
Fire was originally spotted
very early by a traffic helicop-

16:45.160 --> 16:47.855
a traffic helicopter, which was
joined in the air by the police,

16:47.890 --> 16:50.550
who circled the anchor point
until the fire department arrived.

16:50.585 --> 16:52.690
Is that kind of rapid response unusual?

16:52.725 --> 16:54.507
- In the mtz, no.
- Mtz?

16:54.542 --> 16:56.255
It's a mutual threat zone.

16:56.290 --> 16:59.640
It's not just los angeles that's
endangered by a fire at griffith park.

16:59.675 --> 17:02.350
There's glendale. There's burbank...

17:03.940 --> 17:06.599
Uh, detective daniels, you
- you were saying?

17:06.635 --> 17:09.020
I think he was about to add burbank,

17:09.055 --> 17:11.079
san marino, and the county,

17:11.115 --> 17:13.109
and that would be it.

17:17.960 --> 17:19.085
Hey, tao.

17:19.119 --> 17:21.325
We have a name for our
- for our,

17:21.359 --> 17:24.220
uh, homeless woman
with the bleached teeth?

17:24.255 --> 17:26.585
Missing women ages 30 to 50.

17:26.619 --> 17:27.964
Of course, if she
disappeared last night,

17:28.000 --> 17:31.020
- we won't know anything for another 60 hours.
- Why?

17:31.055 --> 17:32.372
Oh, geez. Don't ask him why.

17:32.407 --> 17:33.655
Adults aren't considered missing

17:33.690 --> 17:35.530
until they've been gone
for at least three days,

17:35.565 --> 17:37.082
not to mention the hours it takes

17:37.117 --> 17:38.565
after that to generate the -

17:38.600 --> 17:40.330
why don't you just release
this jane doe's picture,

17:40.365 --> 17:42.370
see if
- see if anyone recognizes her?

17:42.405 --> 17:44.120
Okay. So, croelick's unemployed.

17:44.155 --> 17:45.885
Big surprise.

17:45.920 --> 17:47.625
No known associates...

17:47.660 --> 17:50.050
Uses only prepaid cellphones...

17:50.085 --> 17:51.485
And no car.

17:51.520 --> 17:55.550
Hey, ricky, put down my mother's
crucifix and get out of my chair.

17:59.470 --> 18:02.020
Neighbors say croelick
is polite but distant.

18:02.055 --> 18:03.535
Haven't noticed him dating anyone.

18:03.570 --> 18:07.230
And he always has a candle
burning in his window.

18:07.265 --> 18:08.415
Freak.

18:08.450 --> 18:10.125
Eh, we'll find him.

18:10.160 --> 18:12.180
Not if he finds you first, lieutenant.

18:14.280 --> 18:16.770
Hello, just plain brenda.

18:22.240 --> 18:24.170
Spread 'em. Come on!

18:25.470 --> 18:27.380
No one's been this excited
to see me in a long time.

18:27.415 --> 18:29.330
Well, hello, there, bill.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.440
What brings you here?

18:32.970 --> 18:34.620
Heard you were looking for me.

18:34.655 --> 18:36.210
Thought I'd stop by.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.485
No attorney.

18:37.520 --> 18:39.520
Happy to answer questions.

18:40.770 --> 18:42.445
So...

18:42.480 --> 18:45.820
Deputy chief johnson, up for a chat?

18:48.080 --> 18:51.420
Tching a fire on the news has
all the drama of televised golf.

18:51.455 --> 18:53.980
We don't actually have
anything on croelick -

18:54.015 --> 18:56.710
well, except his record, his pathology,

18:56.745 --> 18:58.767
and his presence near the scene.

18:58.802 --> 19:00.755
Why didn't he bring his attorney?

19:00.790 --> 19:03.510
Over 70% of criminals
never ask for a lawyer.

19:03.545 --> 19:05.530
Afraid it'll make them look guilty.

19:05.565 --> 19:06.935
And it does.

19:06.970 --> 19:09.040
Don't take this personally,lieutenant,

19:09.075 --> 19:10.435
but if you don't leave,

19:10.470 --> 19:12.995
I will invoke my right to counsel.

19:13.030 --> 19:15.520
Why?You lost your sense of humor?

19:19.880 --> 19:20.900
Fine.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.290
We'll catch up later.

19:27.060 --> 19:28.675
He's controlling the interview.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.530
No, that's what we want him to think.

19:30.565 --> 19:31.877
There, now.

19:31.912 --> 19:33.155
Is that better?

19:33.190 --> 19:35.270
Improves the odor of the room...

19:35.305 --> 19:36.850
A little.

19:39.020 --> 19:41.770
You know, I'm a little annoyed.

19:41.805 --> 19:42.605
Why is that?

19:42.640 --> 19:44.830
When it became obvious
you were looking for me,

19:44.865 --> 19:46.375
I went by your house,

19:46.410 --> 19:50.370
and the gay boys that you sold it
to had no idea where you'd gone.

19:52.540 --> 19:54.070
Found a mate?

19:55.460 --> 19:56.620
Living together?

19:56.655 --> 19:57.745
How about you, bill?

19:57.780 --> 19:59.370
Anyone special in your life?

19:59.405 --> 20:01.010
Oh, no.

20:01.320 --> 20:04.230
I'm still carrying a
little torch for you.

20:04.265 --> 20:06.930
Why the interest in my personal life?

20:09.460 --> 20:11.125
When you were at the park last night,

20:11.160 --> 20:14.280
did someone stumble across the body
of a young woman burned to death?

20:14.315 --> 20:15.265
How young?

20:15.300 --> 20:17.665
Oh, that's a cheap trick.

20:17.700 --> 20:19.825
It's not up to your usual standard.

20:19.860 --> 20:24.910
I asked about victims to determine
your specific interest in me.

20:25.340 --> 20:28.310
You were standing across the
street from a really big fire.

20:28.610 --> 20:30.620
It just naturally occurred
to me, given your interests,

20:30.655 --> 20:32.630
that you might have a theory
about how it all started.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.400
That's all.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.530
That's all.

20:39.440 --> 20:40.795
My attorneywould probably want to know

20:40.830 --> 20:44.010
if you searched the crowd for anyone
else with similar alleged interests

20:44.045 --> 20:46.535
and if the swiftness with
which you settled on me

20:46.570 --> 20:50.130
had something to do with my
lawsuit against the state.

20:50.810 --> 20:54.570
Who else in that crowd would
know more about a fire than you?

20:59.360 --> 21:01.045
A moth...

21:01.080 --> 21:02.730
Maybe?

21:06.410 --> 21:08.060
But you have a point.

21:08.510 --> 21:11.025
Well, I have a helpful side.

21:11.060 --> 21:13.210
If you took me back there,

21:13.245 --> 21:14.767
let me watch the fire's end -

21:14.802 --> 21:16.290
it's out of the question.

21:16.325 --> 21:18.515
Oh, come on.

21:18.550 --> 21:21.260
Just the two of us and
a couple of lawn chairs.

21:21.860 --> 21:25.830
You know, the chemicals in the air
should make for a fantastic sunset.

21:27.540 --> 21:31.720
Well, no dental-record match from
the missing women to our jane doe.

21:31.940 --> 21:33.480
Could hold him for a day or two.

21:33.515 --> 21:35.020
Add another million to his lawsuit?

21:35.055 --> 21:36.220
I don't think so.

21:36.255 --> 21:37.440
Buzz.

21:37.970 --> 21:40.890
Lieutenant provenza says we
still can't I.D. our jane doe.

21:40.925 --> 21:42.410
I'm sorry.

21:43.180 --> 21:45.220
You - you - you want
to think about it?

21:46.680 --> 21:50.255
No?Really? All right.

21:50.290 --> 21:52.925
Well, hate to overstay my welcome.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.790
But we're only just
getting reacquainted.

21:54.825 --> 21:56.072
Are you gonna arrest me?No.

21:56.107 --> 21:57.320
May I leave when I wish?Yes.

21:57.355 --> 21:58.280
Goodbye.

21:58.790 --> 22:02.310
At least give me a confirmable
alibi for the hour before the fire.

22:02.345 --> 22:03.740
Please.

22:05.830 --> 22:07.250
I'll tell you what.

22:09.120 --> 22:11.860
I go back to griffith park...

22:12.940 --> 22:14.715
Now...

22:14.750 --> 22:17.510
Or I invoke my right to counsel,

22:17.950 --> 22:20.160
and we never talk again

22:26.720 --> 22:29.830
Wait!Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

22:31.050 --> 22:32.550
He took the bait.

22:38.100 --> 22:39.725
Hey, where are we going?

22:39.760 --> 22:40.930
Taking you where the fire started.

22:40.965 --> 22:42.065
That's what you wanted.

22:42.100 --> 22:44.780
But a firefighter told us
the victim was found up there.

22:44.815 --> 22:46.177
It was night. Smoke everywhere.

22:46.212 --> 22:47.540
Your firefighter was disoriented.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.280
No. This way.

22:51.020 --> 22:53.550
So, now we have to pretend
he's an arson investigator?

22:53.585 --> 22:54.435
Really?

22:54.470 --> 22:55.985
She's just feeding his ego.

22:56.020 --> 22:57.265
We're 10 minutes away from an arrest.

22:57.300 --> 23:01.510
Why don't you
- why don't you button your lip for once and just watch?

23:02.250 --> 23:04.635
It's crazy, you know?

23:04.670 --> 23:07.670
Having a wildlife park
in the center of a city.

23:08.080 --> 23:10.730
I look around at your
little nature preserve.

23:10.765 --> 23:12.330
You know what I see?

23:13.000 --> 23:15.500
It's all fuel.

23:16.290 --> 23:19.395
And you and you and you -

23:19.430 --> 23:22.610
rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief.

23:22.940 --> 23:26.010
Black man... White man...

23:26.630 --> 23:28.685
Deputy chief.

23:28.720 --> 23:30.540
Fire doesn't care about your name

23:30.575 --> 23:33.465
or rank or badge number.

23:33.500 --> 23:39.970
You're all just bite-size lumps of
flesh and bone in the flaming food chain.

23:42.190 --> 23:43.970
God, I'm hungry!

23:44.560 --> 23:45.900
How about you?

23:45.935 --> 23:47.240
I had a big lunch.

23:48.490 --> 23:49.900
Speaking of which...

23:50.360 --> 23:54.300
I can still smell
her - your victim -

23:55.100 --> 23:57.450
'cause she burned right here.

24:05.460 --> 24:06.900
See?

24:08.410 --> 24:12.040
That might be her wallet,
I.D.,credit cards -

24:12.075 --> 24:14.302
all melted away...

24:14.337 --> 24:16.530
Along with her face.

24:17.260 --> 24:19.350
Got a picture of the remains?

24:19.385 --> 24:21.440
That would be inappropriate.

24:22.390 --> 24:23.950
So judgey.

24:28.040 --> 24:29.335
The area around here -

24:29.370 --> 24:30.485
it isn't burned at all.

24:30.520 --> 24:31.950
So, how did the fire -

24:31.985 --> 24:33.127
slip out of control

24:33.162 --> 24:34.270
all the way over there?

24:34.305 --> 24:35.360
Yes.

24:38.740 --> 24:40.980
I think we're looking for another body.

24:41.015 --> 24:42.450
That's not good.

24:43.270 --> 24:46.380
The vegetation back here
has all been cut down -

24:46.415 --> 24:48.605
dried limbs, dead brush...

24:48.640 --> 24:50.685
Dragged from the vicinity
of little miss crisp

24:50.720 --> 24:53.920
and piled like he meant
to take the trash with him.

24:53.955 --> 24:55.475
But the park burning?

24:55.510 --> 24:58.540
No. No, that was a mistake.

24:58.575 --> 25:01.570
Where is the other body, bill?

25:04.220 --> 25:06.730
See, whoever dumped
your girl in that pit

25:06.765 --> 25:08.285
forgot to make sure she was alone.

25:08.320 --> 25:11.560
And when your killer
started his, uh, flamb?

25:16.350 --> 25:18.005
Poor little rat.

25:18.040 --> 25:20.230
Ran out of the frying pan

25:20.265 --> 25:22.420
and started a bonfire.

25:23.630 --> 25:24.955
There you go, sergeant.

25:24.990 --> 25:27.180
Y'all be sure and give
him a proper funeral, now.

25:27.215 --> 25:28.515
Thank you.

25:28.550 --> 25:30.230
Thank you so much.

25:34.190 --> 25:36.230
Picking an isolated spot...

25:36.265 --> 25:37.752
Cutting it back...

25:37.787 --> 25:40.288
Waiting till dark...

25:40.323 --> 25:42.790
And then, in seconds...

25:48.540 --> 25:50.140
All his precautions up in smoke...

25:50.175 --> 25:52.417
The fire moving away from his lady.

25:52.452 --> 25:54.660
Happened very, very fast, I'm sure.

25:54.695 --> 25:56.650
Like drowning.

25:58.640 --> 26:00.960
Well, it might take
me some time to prove,

26:01.130 --> 26:04.140
but it looks to me like you've led
us right to the scene of the crime.

26:05.310 --> 26:06.990
Wouldn't you say, sergeant?

26:07.270 --> 26:09.055
And you described everything so well,

26:09.090 --> 26:12.400
it's
- it's almost like you were here when it happened.

26:15.960 --> 26:18.310
Well, let's take your
implication seriously,

26:18.345 --> 26:19.615
see how it holds up.

26:19.650 --> 26:22.370
The lady was dead before
she was set on fire.

26:22.405 --> 26:23.905
And pardon me for asking,

26:23.940 --> 26:26.840
but, uh, where's the fun in that?

26:26.875 --> 26:29.740
How did you know she was dead?

26:36.130 --> 26:39.520
Well... Should i tell her?

26:39.555 --> 26:41.610
Or should you?

26:45.200 --> 26:46.025
He what?

26:46.060 --> 26:48.980
He interviewed croelick before I did.

26:49.015 --> 26:50.875
How'd you find him before us?

26:50.910 --> 26:54.390
You said he had a lawsuit against
the state for wrongful imprisonment.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.705
He called his attorney.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.645
You called his attorney?

26:58.680 --> 27:00.550
To arrange a meeting, yes.

27:01.260 --> 27:04.420
For the record, you
didn't find croelick, okay?

27:04.455 --> 27:05.565
I did.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.980
And I convinced him to come in,

27:08.015 --> 27:10.110
so I helped you.

27:11.310 --> 27:12.895
Look, all I did was ask a few questions.

27:12.930 --> 27:16.500
You can't ask people questions without
telling them what you want to know.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.735
I need his notes and tapes from
his interview with croelick.

27:19.770 --> 27:21.835
- What?No. No way. - His
photographs, his camera - everything.

27:21.870 --> 27:24.605
- and I will not surrender them.
- It's against the law to interfere with a murder investigation.

27:24.640 --> 27:27.030
- The first amendment allows me to speak to whomever
I want. - It's against the law to aid and abet -

27:27.065 --> 27:28.670
you want to hear about against the law,

27:28.705 --> 27:31.190
I'd be more than happy to oblige!

27:32.080 --> 27:35.150
Morales thinks he can get a
fingerprint off our jane doe.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.840
Look, your victim was
drenched in alcohol,

27:40.875 --> 27:42.882
which is croelick's M.O.Am I wrong?Huh?

27:42.917 --> 27:44.890
Now, he led you to
where the fire started.

27:44.925 --> 27:46.545
He showed you how it happened.

27:46.580 --> 27:49.010
What more do you people
need to make an arrest?

27:49.045 --> 27:50.305
Untainted evidence.

27:50.340 --> 27:52.130
Which might be in your notes -

27:52.165 --> 27:53.920
I can't give you those, okay?

27:55.760 --> 27:57.070
You know what?

27:57.105 --> 27:57.995
Shut up.

27:58.030 --> 28:00.625
We can't even hold
croelick because of you.

28:00.660 --> 28:03.185
You cannot talk to
me like that. Shut up.

28:03.220 --> 28:07.200
I am this far from reading you your rights
- this far.

28:07.235 --> 28:09.200
You want to be under arrest?

28:13.750 --> 28:15.030
I'm sorry, chief.

28:16.020 --> 28:18.670
I'll call his editor and
see what I can work out.

28:18.705 --> 28:20.600
Thank you so much.

28:27.320 --> 28:28.490
May I say something now?

28:28.525 --> 28:30.552
I wouldn't.

28:30.587 --> 28:32.580
No. Mnh-mnh.

28:41.660 --> 28:43.695
We usually get only one
or two shots at this,

28:43.730 --> 28:45.730
which is why I make
the detectives do it.

28:45.765 --> 28:46.725
Do what?

28:46.760 --> 28:50.070
We debone the hand of a burn victim

28:50.105 --> 28:53.380
and rehydrate the skin for 24 hours.

28:53.820 --> 28:57.140
If it works out, sometimes
we can get you a print.

28:58.170 --> 28:59.295
It's too slack.

28:59.330 --> 29:03.730
Which is why I need a detective
close to our jane doe's size.

29:10.050 --> 29:13.340
You want me to slip the
skin of her fingers -

29:13.375 --> 29:14.495
over your own.

29:14.530 --> 29:16.970
And gently, too, because it tears.

29:17.005 --> 29:18.625
I know it sounds horrible,

29:18.660 --> 29:21.940
but it's just the thumb
and two fingers left.

29:21.975 --> 29:24.070
The other two fell off.

29:24.190 --> 29:26.105
Here, chief. Let me help you.

29:26.140 --> 29:28.020
Um, it'll catch on the rubber,

29:28.055 --> 29:30.200
so off with the glove.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.980
I'll tell you what
- eyes on gabriel.

29:45.230 --> 29:46.850
I'll guide your hand.

29:52.250 --> 29:53.185
See, chief?

29:53.220 --> 29:54.915
There's really nothing to it.

29:54.950 --> 29:58.570
It's just
- just science at work.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.110
There. Done.

30:08.790 --> 30:10.645
Linda harrell
- 36.

30:10.680 --> 30:11.725
Fingerprinted two years ago.

30:11.760 --> 30:13.460
Arrested for stalking an ex-boyfriend,

30:13.495 --> 30:14.795
breaking into his house.

30:14.830 --> 30:17.740
I talked to her ex this morning.

30:17.775 --> 30:20.615
Lives in oxnard and has an alibi.

30:20.650 --> 30:23.580
He said that linda always
wanted to know where he was,

30:23.615 --> 30:25.535
demanded all of his attention.

30:25.570 --> 30:29.340
Yeah, well, anyway, she moved
here about two months ago.

30:29.375 --> 30:31.357
No problems that we
know of until yesterday,

30:31.392 --> 30:33.305
when her boss filed
a criminal complaint.

30:33.340 --> 30:35.440
Yeah, linda failed to make
the evening bank deposit

30:35.475 --> 30:37.482
after her bar shift was over

30:37.517 --> 30:39.490
and didn't show up today.

30:40.540 --> 30:41.710
Chief.

30:45.200 --> 30:46.635
Could you please gather the evidence

30:46.670 --> 30:48.950
that we collected from linda's
house and take it to my office?

30:48.985 --> 30:50.132
Thank you so much.

30:50.167 --> 30:51.280
You got it, chief.

30:52.950 --> 30:53.795
Sorry, sir.

30:53.830 --> 30:55.465
Could we talk later?

30:55.500 --> 30:57.850
I've just executed a search
warrant of our victim's house,

30:57.885 --> 30:58.940
which is where she was murdered.

30:58.975 --> 30:59.775
Her car's missing,

30:59.810 --> 31:03.050
and I'm sure that the killer used
it to move her body to the park,

31:03.085 --> 31:04.710
and I really need to
concentrate on finding it.

31:04.745 --> 31:05.805
Then i'll be brief.

31:05.840 --> 31:09.070
The L.A.P.D. and the times
have reached a good compromise.

31:10.960 --> 31:13.910
Chief johnson, I am extremely sorry.

31:14.280 --> 31:14.875
That's the first part.

31:14.910 --> 31:16.780
Now, chief johnson accepts your apology.

31:16.815 --> 31:17.505
I do?

31:17.540 --> 31:18.425
That's great.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.165
The rest of the
agreement goes like this.

31:20.200 --> 31:22.920
You agree to let ricardo
catch up on our investigation.

31:22.955 --> 31:25.285
In return, ricardo agrees
to give you copies of

31:25.320 --> 31:28.000
all of his pictures and
notes from the past two days.

31:29.910 --> 31:31.360
You first.

31:37.370 --> 31:40.490
- Thank you.
Chief. - Mm-hmm.

31:47.770 --> 31:50.550
So, anything from this linda harrell's
house connecting her to croelick?

31:50.585 --> 31:51.545
No.

31:51.580 --> 31:54.285
Her computer was gone, and
her desk was emptied out.

31:54.320 --> 31:57.230
Judging from the dust patterns
on the top of her dresser,

31:57.265 --> 31:59.260
it looked like some
picture frames were removed.

31:59.295 --> 32:00.780
So someone's connected to her.

32:00.815 --> 32:01.645
That's for sure.

32:01.680 --> 32:03.115
There was no sign of forced entry,

32:03.150 --> 32:04.550
suggesting that she knew the killer.

32:04.585 --> 32:05.652
That's inference.

32:05.687 --> 32:06.685
She was a bartender.

32:06.720 --> 32:09.535
Could be one of her
customers followed her home.

32:09.570 --> 32:12.680
Right. A customer who just
happened to be an expert arsonist.

32:12.715 --> 32:15.445
Anyway, linda reached for the phone,

32:15.480 --> 32:17.870
and the murderer
yanked it from the wall.

32:17.905 --> 32:19.770
And grabbed her like this.

32:21.290 --> 32:22.660
Put him down, detective sanchez.

32:22.695 --> 32:24.057
I just wanted to show him the -

32:24.092 --> 32:25.420
talk him through it, please.

32:25.455 --> 32:26.762
Will you put me down?!

32:26.797 --> 32:28.035
What are you
- nuts?

32:28.070 --> 32:31.335
Okay. The killer pushes
linda into some shelving,

32:31.370 --> 32:34.565
and then he drops her to
the ground really hard!

32:34.600 --> 32:38.110
Then the killer reaches for this
bookend and smashed her head in.

32:38.580 --> 32:39.315
She bled out.

32:39.350 --> 32:41.940
Killer cuts the carpet in
half, rolls her up in it,

32:41.975 --> 32:43.440
plops linda down in her own car,

32:43.475 --> 32:44.415
and drives away with her.

32:44.450 --> 32:47.250
Yeah, to the park, where he
sets her on fire. I mean, what?

32:47.285 --> 32:48.505
You didn't see her computer there?

32:48.540 --> 32:50.270
Any residue on this
other half of the carpet?

32:50.305 --> 32:51.500
No.

32:52.510 --> 32:54.730
Thank you, gentlemen.
I'll take it from here.

32:56.600 --> 32:59.610
A fire hot enough to corrupt
computer files beyond recovery

32:59.645 --> 33:00.635
would have grabbed some attention,

33:00.670 --> 33:03.875
and this was supposed
to be a controlled burn.

33:03.910 --> 33:07.080
And the carpet's made
out of artificial fabric,

33:07.115 --> 33:09.497
maybe even treated with flame retardant.

33:09.532 --> 33:11.845
Its fumes could have been poisonous.

33:11.880 --> 33:14.140
But those are the concerns
of an experienced arsonist.

33:14.175 --> 33:15.565
Could be our killer studied up.

33:15.600 --> 33:18.945
For example, you cover
police and fire departments.

33:18.980 --> 33:21.760
Could be you've researched
everything we've discussed so far.

33:21.795 --> 33:23.895
And what motive could I possibly have?

33:23.930 --> 33:27.020
You don't always solve
murders by finding out why.

33:27.055 --> 33:28.925
Sometimes it's more about how,

33:28.960 --> 33:33.630
which is why I keep asking
how could the killer get away?

33:33.665 --> 33:35.482
Well, croelick had the victim's car.

33:35.517 --> 33:37.300
Maybe he drove it away somewhere.

33:39.080 --> 33:42.270
Helicopters buzzing around,
firefighters pouring in,

33:42.305 --> 33:44.265
police blocking all the exits -

33:44.300 --> 33:46.100
no, he didn't dare go back to the car.

33:46.135 --> 33:48.295
Like you, he knew far too much

33:48.330 --> 33:51.410
about how police and
firefighters work to even try.

33:51.445 --> 33:54.185
Would you have burned linda's body

33:54.220 --> 33:58.550
to delay identification only to leave
a registered vehicle parked nearby,

33:58.585 --> 34:00.660
knowing we would find it?

34:01.000 --> 34:02.595
But you haven't found it.

34:02.630 --> 34:04.625
And that's your problem, isn't it?

34:04.660 --> 34:08.409
Explaining how the killer got
out of the park with the car

34:08.445 --> 34:11.679
after the fire started
without being noticed.

34:12.090 --> 34:14.420
You've summed it up perfectly.

34:15.870 --> 34:17.715
Interrupting an interview?

34:17.750 --> 34:20.989
No. No. Ricardo here is up to speed.

34:21.025 --> 34:22.286
We'll talk more later.

34:22.322 --> 34:23.514
Thank you so much.

34:23.550 --> 34:24.574
You're welcome so much.

34:24.610 --> 34:25.565
Can I have my book, please?

34:25.600 --> 34:28.500
Oh, no. I'll be holding
on to these for a while.

34:36.699 --> 34:39.949
The landlord's bringing a plumber
by to fix the toilets today.

34:39.985 --> 34:41.469
Oh, wonderful.

34:41.940 --> 34:44.260
I vacuumed all the furniture...

34:44.880 --> 34:46.835
Put out a room deodorizer...

34:46.870 --> 34:50.824
Got rid of all
incriminating kitty evidence.

34:50.860 --> 34:54.030
Also, I shoved everything we're
not using into the guest room -

34:54.065 --> 34:57.200
you know, so the landlord will
think we're actually living there.

34:57.235 --> 34:58.505
Oh, I feel badly you had to do all -

34:58.540 --> 35:02.170
Don't. Because while I was scrub,
scrub, scrubbing out the shower,

35:02.205 --> 35:07.170
I finally decided how
to deal with your cat.

35:07.205 --> 35:07.935
Our cat.

35:07.970 --> 35:11.890
Your cat is not coming home until
the landlord knows she's there.

35:11.925 --> 35:12.985
But where will he live?

35:13.020 --> 35:16.005
She. With you in your office.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.780
Okay. Now, wait a
minute. I'm really sorry.

35:18.815 --> 35:19.795
Which is good
- I appreciate that.

35:19.830 --> 35:23.085
But if I leave him here,
maintenance will take him away.

35:23.120 --> 35:27.480
Well, you can stop by the pound
every morning and pick her back up.

35:28.730 --> 35:30.725
They take her away,
and I pick her up later.

35:30.760 --> 35:34.670
And the inside of our apartment can
stop looking like norway in december.

35:36.090 --> 35:38.760
Brenda, are
- are you here?Hello?

35:38.795 --> 35:40.702
Oh, kitty. I'm so sorry.

35:40.737 --> 35:42.575
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

35:42.610 --> 35:45.685
- I have to hurry - really
hurry. - Why?Where are you going?

35:45.720 --> 35:48.760
Because during a fire, police
manage civilian evacuations,

35:48.795 --> 35:51.265
tow cars, and direct traffic,

35:51.300 --> 35:54.760
and he still has the keys.
I'll explain more later.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.545
Okay. Poor kitty.

35:57.580 --> 36:02.265
- Could you please make sure that there's water left for him...
- Her...

36:02.300 --> 36:07.510
And some food and make sure that the
office doors are closed tight, tight, tight.

36:09.360 --> 36:11.610
Tight, tight, tight.

36:28.130 --> 36:31.475
Tom?Tom merrick?

36:31.510 --> 36:33.275
Uh, you're the hero firefighter

36:33.310 --> 36:36.265
that I interviewed in the
hospital yesterday, right?

36:36.300 --> 36:39.220
You remember me?I'm deputy
chief brenda leigh johnson.

36:39.255 --> 36:40.285
Sure.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.175
What a coincidence.

36:42.210 --> 36:44.090
What
- what are you doing here?

36:44.125 --> 36:45.225
Just working.

36:45.260 --> 36:49.430
This is where the L.A.P.D.towed
all the vehicles from the fire.

36:49.465 --> 36:51.805
You know, and speaking of coincidences,

36:51.840 --> 36:55.105
the woman whose body that
you carried out of the park -

36:55.140 --> 36:58.370
this is her car, a-and
you're holding the keys to it.

37:00.310 --> 37:02.190
You remember sergeant
gabriel here, don't you?

37:02.225 --> 37:03.740
Say hello, sergeant.

37:03.775 --> 37:04.905
Hello.

37:04.940 --> 37:06.995
Tom merrick, you have the
right to remain silent.

37:07.030 --> 37:10.050
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

37:10.085 --> 37:11.382
You have the right to an attorney.

37:11.417 --> 37:12.645
If you cannot afford an attorney,

37:12.680 --> 37:14.430
one will be appointed
for you by the state.

37:14.465 --> 37:16.145
Have you heard and
understood these rights?

37:16.180 --> 37:18.190
Yes, I understand, but
you're making a big mistake.

37:18.225 --> 37:19.245
Well, maybe.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.380
Now, i've only one
question to ask you myself,

37:21.415 --> 37:23.235
but sergeant gabriel here thinks

37:23.270 --> 37:26.230
that we should arrest you for
the murder of linda harrell -

37:26.265 --> 37:28.730
something about the clearing
where the body was found.

37:28.765 --> 37:29.735
What is it, sergeant?

37:29.770 --> 37:31.740
Well, he moved out all
the homeless, A.K.A.

37:31.775 --> 37:33.755
Possible witnesses, a day ago,

37:33.790 --> 37:37.300
so he knew he could carry linda's
body in there without being seen,

37:37.335 --> 37:38.770
and all the vegetation was cut back.

37:38.805 --> 37:40.075
To control the burn.

37:40.110 --> 37:42.850
But I say that that's what a
firefighter does for a living.

37:42.885 --> 37:45.210
And then there was something about a
- a phone.

37:45.245 --> 37:46.685
Lieutenant tao.

37:46.720 --> 37:49.120
The phone that was ripped off
the wall at linda's house -

37:49.155 --> 37:50.365
when you hit the redial button,

37:50.400 --> 37:53.750
what shows up are the first five
digits of his home phone number.

37:54.220 --> 37:57.105
But linda had a history
of nasty breakups.

37:57.140 --> 37:59.295
Maybe she wanted to chat with your wife,

37:59.330 --> 38:01.625
and you were just trying to stop her.

38:01.660 --> 38:03.885
And in my opinion, it was just luck

38:03.920 --> 38:09.820
that you changed out of your
regular clothes into your uniform

38:09.855 --> 38:11.135
when you burned linda's body,

38:11.170 --> 38:13.295
but, you know, it was really good luck

38:13.330 --> 38:15.175
because while we were
looking for an arsonist,

38:15.210 --> 38:18.860
you were able to run out of the
park with your fellow firefighters,

38:18.895 --> 38:20.352
carrying the victim,

38:20.387 --> 38:21.775
looking like a hero.

38:21.810 --> 38:23.505
Okay, so, the uniform was lucky,

38:23.540 --> 38:25.610
but everything else points to murder.

38:25.645 --> 38:27.475
We can't prove that, sergeant.

38:27.510 --> 38:32.030
Be patient and let Mr. Merrick here answer
the only question that I think is important.

38:32.065 --> 38:35.760
Now think hard and be honest.

38:36.210 --> 38:38.790
Did you kill linda harrell on purpose?

38:39.180 --> 38:41.105
No. No!

38:41.140 --> 38:42.135
I never wanted to hurt her.

38:42.170 --> 38:45.960
I
- I... I just wanted to stop her from calling my wife.

38:45.995 --> 38:47.375
There was a shelf.

38:47.410 --> 38:49.910
It fell on her. It was
a complete accident.

38:50.370 --> 38:51.970
She died before I could get help.

38:52.005 --> 38:53.980
It's the truth. I swear.

38:54.015 --> 38:55.792
I believe you.

38:55.827 --> 38:57.535
See, sergeant?

38:57.570 --> 38:59.125
We can't hold him for linda's death.

38:59.160 --> 39:02.880
You're just gonna have to be satisfied
arresting him on a charge of arson.

39:02.915 --> 39:05.775
Oh, and, um, four
counts of felony murder -

39:05.810 --> 39:10.290
one for each of the people who died when
your little fire slipped out of control.

39:10.620 --> 39:12.015
Wait. Wait. Wait!

39:12.050 --> 39:13.375
I want a lawyer.

39:13.410 --> 39:16.360
Yeah?Well, you're gonna
need one, buddy boy.

39:19.100 --> 39:20.540
Hey, chief johnson.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.945
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:27.980 --> 39:29.180
Everything's flushing great.

39:29.215 --> 39:31.260
Oh, thank you so much.

39:31.920 --> 39:33.960
And your friend is in the living room.

39:33.995 --> 39:35.245
Oh, wonderful.

39:35.280 --> 39:36.950
It's so nice to meet you.

39:36.985 --> 39:38.082
Goodbye.

39:38.117 --> 39:39.180
Friend?

39:40.020 --> 39:41.520
He may have meant me.

39:41.555 --> 39:42.792
Move!Get back!

39:42.827 --> 39:44.028
I didn't break in.

39:44.063 --> 39:45.195
Move!Further!Hurry up!

39:45.230 --> 39:47.080
- Your friendly plumber opened the door for me.
- Fritz?

39:47.115 --> 39:48.605
- And this is hardly an appropriate way
- fritzi?

39:48.640 --> 39:50.890
- To greet someone who helped you solve a murder.
- Fritz?

39:50.925 --> 39:53.860
Your fbi-agent boyfriend is not here.

39:57.710 --> 39:59.950
You're still upset with me, brenda?

40:02.010 --> 40:05.705
The news says your firefighter
was having an affair

40:05.740 --> 40:10.010
with an angry, possessive young
lady who didn't know he was married.

40:10.045 --> 40:14.280
Probably why he sent you to the
wrong part of park to begin with.

40:14.315 --> 40:18.220
And you find the right
place because of me.

40:18.670 --> 40:21.230
So... Why the, uh...

40:22.050 --> 40:23.835
Hostility?

40:23.870 --> 40:25.700
Can't you prove your case?

40:25.735 --> 40:28.135
Yes. Yes.

40:28.170 --> 40:29.360
You are completely out of the woods,

40:29.395 --> 40:31.802
so why come here?Why?

40:31.837 --> 40:34.210
Apology accepted.

40:35.930 --> 40:39.100
And I brought you something...

40:40.020 --> 40:46.270
A gesture towards what I hope
will be an amicable parting. May I?

41:07.330 --> 41:08.830
Now...

41:09.290 --> 41:10.375
Brenda...

41:10.410 --> 41:13.860
I'm about to settle my lawsuit
against the state and take my,

41:13.895 --> 41:17.635
uh, $4 million

41:17.670 --> 41:20.025
and leave your jurisdiction ver.

41:20.060 --> 41:24.165
And though i'm, you know,
flattered by your interest in me,

41:24.200 --> 41:27.470
I think we've taken this relationship
about as far as it can go.

41:27.505 --> 41:28.325
You know?

41:28.360 --> 41:32.120
And I think it best for both of us

41:32.370 --> 41:35.160
if I regard you as something like...

41:35.840 --> 41:37.700
An old flame.

41:39.540 --> 41:40.930
So...

41:41.430 --> 41:44.005
Let's say our goodbyes
and wish each other well.

41:44.040 --> 41:46.260
If you're not out of my
house in the next 10 seconds,

41:46.295 --> 41:48.220
I'm gonna save the state
a whole lot of money.

41:48.255 --> 41:49.807
- And I'm not kidding.
- Okay.

41:49.842 --> 41:51.360
Get out of here. Never come back.

41:51.395 --> 41:53.380
I see you agree with me.

41:53.415 --> 41:56.850
Good. Well, I'm off.

41:58.300 --> 42:01.190
I will think of you
often, just plain brenda,

42:01.225 --> 42:04.850
and hope to see you not at all.

42:05.080 --> 42:07.530
Hey. Brenda?

42:12.890 --> 42:14.840
Brenda, are you here?

42:19.720 --> 42:21.020
Yes. Hi.

42:21.055 --> 42:22.320
Hey.

42:24.060 --> 42:26.820
Hey. Look at that.

42:27.840 --> 42:29.035
And kitty.

42:29.070 --> 42:30.230
Oh. Yes.

42:31.020 --> 42:33.765
I called the landlord and begged

42:33.800 --> 42:37.130
and gave him a huge security deposit

42:37.165 --> 42:40.460
and promised him monthly inspections.

42:43.370 --> 42:45.310
Well, I have something for you, too.

42:45.345 --> 42:46.665
Wait here.

42:46.700 --> 42:48.475
You know, uh...

42:48.510 --> 42:51.530
I know you thought you
lost this in the move.

42:52.550 --> 42:54.380
Look what I found.

42:56.450 --> 42:59.365
- It was ju- hey,
you all right? - Yes.

42:59.400 --> 43:01.815
Honey, you look a little
- oh, no, I'm fine.

43:01.850 --> 43:04.230
I just haven't slept
in two days, that's all.

43:04.265 --> 43:05.460
Yeah?

43:07.600 --> 43:09.760
You'll feel better tomorrow.

43:12.050 --> 43:14.430
Never in a million years
would I have thought

43:14.465 --> 43:17.127
you'd have done something so romantic.

43:17.162 --> 43:19.790
Actually, I didn't buy these myself.

43:19.825 --> 43:21.997
Well, where did they come from?

43:22.032 --> 43:24.170
Just... Someone I worked with.

43:26.210 --> 43:28.615
A housewarming gift.

43:28.650 --> 43:32.000
