I do not like doughnuts,

[ Door shuts ]

15:48.331 --> 15:49.497
Well, it's gonna be
a fun one today

15:49.532 --> 15:50.798
at Abbott Elementary.

15:50.834 --> 15:53.200
Okay, listen, I'm no lawyer,

15:53.219 --> 15:55.303
but I know a thing
or two about arbitration.

15:55.338 --> 15:58.506
My ex and I were able to settle
custody of our season tickets

15:58.541 --> 16:00.892
to the Phillies
out of court like adults.

16:00.927 --> 16:03.344
I just want what is best
for Cinnamon Cupcake Hill.

16:03.379 --> 16:04.679
All you do is work.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.397
Milton barely knows
who you are.

16:06.433 --> 16:07.682
He lives at my job!

16:07.717 --> 16:08.983
Okay, okay, enough.

16:09.019 --> 16:10.068
Let's get to the bottom
of this.

16:10.103 --> 16:12.386
Jacob, what do you want?

16:12.405 --> 16:15.573
CC should live with me and Zach
in a two-parent household,

16:15.608 --> 16:17.725
not some geriatric
bachelor pad.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.226
You don't know
what kind of pad I have

16:19.245 --> 16:21.562
or how many parents
live there!

16:21.581 --> 16:24.582
Although, my furniture
is all leather.

16:24.617 --> 16:26.334
Oh, and a suede loveseat.

16:26.369 --> 16:27.335
So it's sorted.

16:27.370 --> 16:29.236
Cat will live with Jacob
full-time

16:29.255 --> 16:32.840
but does every other weekend
with Mr. Johnson.

16:32.876 --> 16:35.843
You get all the fun and
little-to-no responsibility.

16:35.879 --> 16:39.714
Believe me, your upholstery
will thank me for it.

16:39.749 --> 16:41.099
You want a chocolate?

16:41.134 --> 16:42.216
You like chocolate, right?

16:42.251 --> 16:43.217
There you go.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.352
Yeah.

16:44.387 --> 16:45.887
What, you're giving
these away?

16:45.922 --> 16:47.722
You're very observant.
[ Chuckles ]

16:47.757 --> 16:49.390
I get that all the time.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.726
People tell me I have
quite the eye for detail.

16:53.897 --> 16:55.613
Well, maybe not an eye
for detail,

16:55.648 --> 16:59.433
but I am very good at picking up
on subtle social cues.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.235
You thought Mr. Morton had
a crush on you last year.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.371
[ Clears throat ] Well,
that was before I realized

17:03.406 --> 17:05.623
I have an
insecure attachment style.

17:05.658 --> 17:07.742
I now recognize it
for the disdain that it is.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.243
Jacob, what do you want?

17:09.278 --> 17:10.378
I don't know, man.

17:10.413 --> 17:12.296
You just been weird
about that candy.

17:12.332 --> 17:16.617
And as somebody who knows
your spirit, that ain't you.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.302
And the whole Mo thing?

17:18.338 --> 17:22.423
I mean, you seemed not edgy,
but, like, jealous.

17:25.678 --> 17:28.096
Oh, my God is a woman!

17:28.131 --> 17:29.296
Gregory, Gregory, Gregory!

17:29.315 --> 17:30.898
Stop or I'll scream.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.435
[ Sighs ]

17:34.470 --> 17:37.071
Do you like Janine?

17:37.107 --> 17:38.906
You're projecting.
No, if I was projecting,

17:38.942 --> 17:40.158
I would say,
"Do you love Janine?"

17:40.193 --> 17:41.275
Because I love Janine.

17:41.310 --> 17:42.610
I said "like."

17:44.781 --> 17:46.581
You sound ridiculous.

17:51.538 --> 17:53.121
The plot thickens.
[ Cat meows ]

17:55.158 --> 17:56.924
You got something to say to me,
then just say it.

17:56.960 --> 17:58.009
I already did.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.127
Well, if you got something else
to say to me,

17:59.162 --> 18:00.161
then just say it.

18:00.180 --> 18:01.429
But what you not gon' do
is give me

18:01.464 --> 18:02.764
the cold shoulder
in this school that I own.

18:02.799 --> 18:05.516
Again, the principal
runs the school,

18:05.552 --> 18:08.436
does not own the school.

18:08.471 --> 18:10.138
You know how many times
Henry comes to my office

18:10.173 --> 18:12.640
needing pants or lunch money
or something?

18:12.675 --> 18:14.776
I'm happy he trusts you enough
to ask for help.

18:14.811 --> 18:16.611
It doesn't matter
how much he trusts me.

18:16.646 --> 18:18.345
I want to teach him to make
extra money to pocket

18:18.364 --> 18:20.031
so he can take care
of himself.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.699
Some of our students
don't have it like that.

18:21.734 --> 18:24.819
I have been an educator longer
than you have been alive,

18:24.854 --> 18:27.205
and I am well aware
of our students'

18:27.240 --> 18:30.374
many stressors
and financial situations.

18:30.410 --> 18:34.528
But that does not mean that
they should lie, cheat, or scam.

18:34.547 --> 18:35.663
Nobody got hurt
because he sold

18:35.698 --> 18:37.698
that candy
for a little more.
I --

18:37.717 --> 18:39.533
And the only reason you get
to have "morals" about this

18:39.552 --> 18:41.469
is because
you can afford them.

18:41.504 --> 18:43.671
You didn't grow up having
to make hard choices.

18:43.706 --> 18:44.806
I did.

18:44.841 --> 18:47.475
And what you call "scamming"
got me by.

18:47.510 --> 18:48.542
And look at me now.

18:48.561 --> 18:50.344
I own a school.

[ Sighs ]

18:59.606 --> 19:03.057
So, it turns out the cat belongs
to Brianne in fourth grade.

19:03.076 --> 19:04.391
She, uh, lost him

19:04.410 --> 19:05.910
when she brought him in
for show and tell,

19:05.945 --> 19:09.363
which you are not supposed
to do, for obvious reasons.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.581
Don't touch me!

19:10.617 --> 19:12.333
I told you, we three should've
gotten in that car

19:12.368 --> 19:13.734
and never looked back.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.119
[ Sobbing ]

19:16.005 --> 19:19.240
Henry, may I talk to you
for a moment, please?

19:19.259 --> 19:21.709
I didn't mean to embarrass you
in front of your friends.

19:21.744 --> 19:24.011
Sweetheart, you did
no such thing.

19:24.047 --> 19:26.747
I'm sorry
for embarrassing you.

19:26.766 --> 19:28.415
Forgive me?

19:28.434 --> 19:32.053
I don't think an adult has ever
apologized to me before.

19:32.088 --> 19:33.554
It's kinda lit.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.022
I forgive you, Ms. Howard.

19:35.058 --> 19:37.225
Thank you, Henry.

19:37.260 --> 19:38.592
Would you be interested
in helping out

19:38.611 --> 19:40.228
at a church bake sale?

19:40.263 --> 19:42.763
We're gonna need an expert
salesman like you

19:42.782 --> 19:44.532
if we're gonna
make any money.

19:44.567 --> 19:46.117
You'll get a cut out
of everything you sell.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.735
How about 5%?

19:49.956 --> 19:51.105
90%.

19:51.124 --> 19:53.774
10%, and you get to keep
whatever you don't sell.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.626
Deal.
Deal.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.495
Yeah.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.415
Barb.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.084
Next time I do something
to help others,

20:03.119 --> 20:04.285
which I'm very good at,

20:04.304 --> 20:05.636
I'll make sure to give you
the whole story

20:05.672 --> 20:07.054
so that you're not surprised.

20:07.090 --> 20:09.390
Thank you, Ava.

20:09.425 --> 20:11.559
Honoring what I just said,
I borrowed your school ID

20:11.594 --> 20:12.626
to get free pancakes

20:12.645 --> 20:14.262
at the Original Hip-Hop House
of Pancakes.

20:14.297 --> 20:15.763
They give it to teachers
and not principals.

20:15.798 --> 20:17.598
Ain't that criminal?

20:21.771 --> 20:23.905
Hey.
Hey.

20:23.940 --> 20:26.307
So, I know that your date
is tonight,

20:26.326 --> 20:28.576
and I just wanted to say
that I hope you have fun.

20:28.611 --> 20:30.411
Mo's a really good guy.

20:30.446 --> 20:32.163
Aww. Thank you.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.832
He must be if he's friends
with you.

20:34.867 --> 20:36.584
Oh, um, one more thing.

20:36.619 --> 20:37.651
Maybe don't order the ribs.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.669
I've seen you eat ribs
before.

20:38.705 --> 20:41.505
It can get aggressive.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.590
That's a good call.

20:47.462 --> 20:48.796
And, you know, it was
just really shocking

20:48.831 --> 20:50.164
for the whole family.

20:50.183 --> 20:51.182
I mean, I know I wasn't prepared
to lose her, you know.

20:51.217 --> 20:54.635
Small, just a kid.

20:54.670 --> 20:55.970
It really changed the way
I looked at life

20:56.005 --> 20:58.005
from that day forward.

20:58.024 --> 21:00.474
Wow.

21:00.509 --> 21:01.609
You know, I never really
opened up

about this kind
of stuff before.

Well, speaking of sharing,
do you want some of this?

21:13.723 --> 21:15.373
It's really good.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.325
No, no, no.
No, thank you.
