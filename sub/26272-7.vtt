08:33.600 --> 08:37.560

How can she be angry

08:51.922 --> 08:55.447
It's complicated, but what
sociopaths like Tally do feel

08:55.491 --> 08:57.580
are emotions
involving themselves.

08:57.624 --> 08:59.582
That's why you don't get
joy or sadness,

08:59.626 --> 09:00.801
because those are emotions

09:00.844 --> 09:02.498

to other people.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.327

she doesn't remember.

09:13.378 --> 09:15.467
Well, that's pretty
damn convenient.

09:15.511 --> 09:19.297
Agreed. The thing is,
she is prone to blackouts,

09:19.341 --> 09:21.648

anything that happened

at the party and waking up

defense.
Mm.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.005
According to Bull,
she has suffered

09:31.048 --> 09:34.225
from fugue state blackouts
since she was a child.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.575
Fugue state blackouts?

09:35.618 --> 09:36.663
Was she asleep?

09:36.706 --> 09:37.881
Was she awake?

09:37.925 --> 09:40.144
A fugue state
is a dissociative episode

09:40.188 --> 09:43.539
where sufferers experience
temporary amnesia

09:43.583 --> 09:46.455
and a lack of awareness
of themselves or their actions.

09:46.498 --> 09:47.978
Okay, so what's
the big guy say?

09:48.022 --> 09:50.633
Does he think that this fugue
thing is a credible defense?

09:50.677 --> 09:53.331
Does he think that the jury
will buy into it?

09:53.375 --> 09:56.987
No. Bull wants to plead not
guilty by reason of insanity.

09:58.162 --> 09:59.599
If Tally was
in a fugue state

09:59.642 --> 10:02.819

the substantial capacity

of her conduct

any insanity plea precedents.

What are you talking about?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.935
I'm not!

11:14.978 --> 11:17.111
She was my favorite aunt.

11:17.154 --> 11:19.548
And I don't know how
I'm gonna go on living.

11:19.591 --> 11:22.246
BULL:
I have every confidence
you'll find a way.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.642
You always know, don't you?

11:26.686 --> 11:27.817
BULL:
That's my job, Tally.

11:27.861 --> 11:30.472
[click]

11:37.218 --> 11:38.523
WOMAN:
According to
the incident reports,

11:38.567 --> 11:41.483
the murder weapon--
the scissors--

11:41.526 --> 11:43.703
were wiped clean
of fingerprints.

11:43.746 --> 11:46.749
Dr. Diposo, you're
a forensic psychiatrist.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.751
Have you seen this kind
of thing before?

11:48.795 --> 11:50.884
All the time.Really?

11:50.927 --> 11:52.668
And why would a killer
do such a thing?

11:52.712 --> 11:55.497
It sort of goes
without saying.

11:55.540 --> 11:58.369
Generally, if a murder weapon
is found wiped of fingerprints,

11:58.413 --> 12:01.111
it indicates that the killer was
trying to hide their identity

12:01.155 --> 12:02.722
to avoid getting caught.

12:02.765 --> 12:04.158
That makes
enormous sense.

12:04.201 --> 12:06.595
Now, what makes
less sense--

12:06.638 --> 12:08.205
and admittedly,
I'm not the expert here,

12:08.249 --> 12:09.729
you are...

12:09.772 --> 12:12.732
Is it possible that someone
in a fugue state blackout

12:12.775 --> 12:14.124
would have the presence of mind

12:14.168 --> 12:15.691
to wipe
their weapon?

12:15.735 --> 12:18.912
Well, that's an act
of specific intent.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.957
I would find it highly unlikely.

12:21.001 --> 12:22.611
Hmm.

12:22.654 --> 12:25.745
And how would you interpret
the fibers found

12:25.788 --> 12:27.572
in the blood
on the victim's neck

12:27.616 --> 12:29.705
and the bloodied sheet
found nearby?

12:29.749 --> 12:33.056
It would appear that the killer
tried to staunch the bleeding

12:33.100 --> 12:36.320
after stabbing the victim.
My guess is the killer

12:36.364 --> 12:38.670
experienced a moment
of remorse--

12:38.714 --> 12:40.585
regretted what
he or she had done,

12:40.629 --> 12:42.631
and wanted to try
and save the victim.

12:42.674 --> 12:46.113
Now, in your
professional opinion,

12:46.156 --> 12:48.768
is that kind of remorse
consistent with someone

12:48.811 --> 12:50.030
in a fugue state,
Doctor?

12:50.073 --> 12:51.771
Quite the contrary.

12:51.814 --> 12:54.817
That would demonstrate
a high degree of self-awareness

12:54.861 --> 12:57.733
that people in fugue states
rarely possess.

12:57.777 --> 13:00.214
Sorry to be the bearer, but
this jury is finding the witness

13:00.257 --> 13:02.738
[over earbud]:
extremely credible
and compelling. At the moment,

13:02.782 --> 13:05.785
we are looking at only
a single green juror.

13:05.828 --> 13:07.699
No, no, it's fine.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.266
I don't care.
It's all good.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.702
PROSECUTOR:
No further questions
at this time.

13:10.746 --> 13:11.703
One green juror--

13:11.747 --> 13:13.401
you call that all good?

13:13.444 --> 13:15.055
I'll get 'em back
on the cross, Bull.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.404
Just call for a recess.

13:16.447 --> 13:18.798
You sure?Mm.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.671
Your Honor, the defense
would like to request

13:22.714 --> 13:24.281
a short recess.

13:25.848 --> 13:28.155
Hey, you want to tell me
what's going on?

13:28.198 --> 13:30.200
That forensic psychiatrist--

13:30.244 --> 13:32.942
she just declared
our client not guilty.

13:32.986 --> 13:34.683
I'm sorry, were you in
the same courtroom I was?

13:34.726 --> 13:36.163
I sure was.

13:36.206 --> 13:39.819
She said whoever killed Torin
felt a moment of remorse.

13:39.862 --> 13:41.864
And?Remorse is a function
of empathy.

13:41.908 --> 13:45.302
You share the pain
the other person is feeling.

13:45.346 --> 13:48.523
Sociopaths like Tally
don't have empathy.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.830
They certainly don't
feel remorse.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.876
Our client didn't do this.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.182
She's not the killer.

13:55.225 --> 13:57.793
Wait a second, wait
a second, wait a second.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.882
Mm. Mm-mmm.

13:59.926 --> 14:03.886
We already told the jury
that Tally did do it.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.279
She killed her brother.

14:05.322 --> 14:07.542
Not guilty by
reason of insanity.

14:07.585 --> 14:08.891
That was our plea.

14:08.935 --> 14:10.806
Now we're saying
she didn't do it?

14:10.850 --> 14:12.242
[grunts softly]

14:12.286 --> 14:14.723
[scoffs]
Oh, my goodness.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.507
So, how-how does this work?

14:16.551 --> 14:18.596
Do we just go in there
and tell the jury

14:18.640 --> 14:20.337
that we were wrong?

14:21.382 --> 14:22.774
I guess so.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.913
So now you want to
change your plea?I do, Your Honor.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.046
Well, in truth, there's nothing
I can do to stop you,

14:33.089 --> 14:36.353
but given your original plea
and your opening statement,

14:36.397 --> 14:38.965
I fear you're gonna
confuse and frustrate the jury.

14:41.532 --> 14:43.491
We are willing to accept
that risk, Your Honor.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.493
Hmm.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.451
A.D.A. Scrivener,
you have anything to say?

14:47.495 --> 14:49.801
I just want to be clear.
You opened the door

14:49.845 --> 14:51.803
to your client's mental health
when you entered

14:51.847 --> 14:53.936
a plea of not guilty
by reason of insanity.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.156
I am taking the position
that all of that material

14:56.199 --> 14:58.245
we were able to access
by dint of that plea

14:58.288 --> 14:59.724
is still on the table.

14:59.768 --> 15:02.423
Clinical evaluations, doctors'
records, what have you--

15:02.466 --> 15:03.946
all of that is still admissible.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.992
Doesn't just go away
because you changed your mind.

15:06.035 --> 15:08.342
We understand that.
But, just so we're clear,

15:08.385 --> 15:10.213
our client's mental health
is no longer the point.

15:10.257 --> 15:12.955
We intend to prove
she simply didn't do it.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.914
And, sane or crazy,
you can't convict someone

15:14.957 --> 15:17.177
for something
they simply didn't do.

15:17.220 --> 15:19.875
All right, everybody
back to your corners.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.399
And just so that I'm clear--
new plea, old plea--

15:22.443 --> 15:25.620
this trial is proceeding
tomorrow morning at 9:00 sharp.

15:25.663 --> 15:28.666
And please be ready to call
your first witness, gentlemen.

15:30.059 --> 15:31.539
BULL:
Years ago, when
I used to treat Tally,

15:31.582 --> 15:32.714
if she had one of these

15:32.757 --> 15:36.413
fugue state blackouts...

15:36.457 --> 15:40.200
there were still
always splinters of memory.

15:40.243 --> 15:41.853
Tiny things that
she would remember

15:41.897 --> 15:43.246
about the events
that took place.

15:43.290 --> 15:46.032
And she couldn't always
make sense of them,

15:46.075 --> 15:47.903
but they were there.

15:47.947 --> 15:51.733
This murder,
this supposed blackout--

15:51.776 --> 15:53.561
she remembers nothing.

15:53.604 --> 15:56.477
Which makes perfect sense
if she didn't do it.

15:56.520 --> 16:00.350
Yeah, but having her testify
that she simply doesn't remember

16:00.394 --> 16:03.049
is not going to convince
the jury to let her off.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.920
[sighs]

16:04.964 --> 16:06.443
I know this is easier
said than done,

16:06.487 --> 16:08.532
but I fear the only way
to prove she didn't do it

16:08.576 --> 16:10.099
is to figure out who did.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.361
See that?

16:11.405 --> 16:14.016
Mediocre minds
think alike.

16:14.060 --> 16:17.106
Danny and I are
way ahead of you on this.

16:17.150 --> 16:18.934
[clears throat]

16:21.545 --> 16:22.938
What have we here?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.635
This is everyone
we've been able to confirm

16:24.679 --> 16:26.594
was in attendance
at that party.

16:26.637 --> 16:28.988
I sourced most of them from
the party's Facebook page.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.902
These gray boxes
with question marks

16:30.946 --> 16:32.382
are still unidentified guests.

16:32.426 --> 16:35.559
Apparently, there were
a lot of uninvited walk-ins.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.344
Anybody jump out at you?

16:37.387 --> 16:38.780
Yeah, this guy.

16:38.823 --> 16:40.521
With the red baseball cap
with the plaid shirt.

16:40.564 --> 16:43.524
Almost everyone
that I spoke with mentioned him.

16:43.567 --> 16:45.134
And he brought
hostess gifts.

16:45.178 --> 16:47.006
Drugs.
A lot of them.

16:47.049 --> 16:48.485
Torin confronted him,
kicked him out.

16:48.529 --> 16:49.965
Might be something,
might be nothing.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.359
But in the meantime
I'm tracking him down.

16:52.402 --> 16:54.709
A shirt and a cap's not
a lot to go on, though.

16:54.752 --> 16:57.581
Just tell me we have someone
to put on the stand tomorrow.

16:57.625 --> 17:00.062
Colonel Mustard with the
candlestick in the parlor.

17:00.106 --> 17:02.543
Professor Plum, Mrs. White...

17:02.586 --> 17:04.588
I'll take anyone.TAYLOR:
Again,

17:04.632 --> 17:06.721
mediocre minds.

17:06.764 --> 17:08.070
This is Blake Lambert.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.376
He's the one
I'd put on the stand.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.247
DANNY:
We reached out to him.
He wants to help.

17:11.291 --> 17:12.553
One of Torin's
best friends.

17:12.596 --> 17:14.163
He's known Torin
and Tally for years.

17:14.207 --> 17:15.469
Can speak to their history.

17:15.512 --> 17:17.297
He was a co-host on
the party's Facebook event.

17:17.340 --> 17:19.647
At the very least, he could
speak to how many people

17:19.690 --> 17:21.605
were there, insinuate
that the prosecution

17:21.649 --> 17:23.477
may have jumped the gun
in finding their suspect.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.263
I mean, there were
a hundred guests at that party.

17:27.307 --> 17:29.352
That's 99 potential murderers.

17:29.396 --> 17:31.528
Sounds like a fine
witness to me.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.574
And we'll keep working.

17:35.532 --> 17:36.925
What siblings don't fight?

17:36.968 --> 17:38.970
Torin and Tally
argued all the time

17:39.014 --> 17:40.711
about money,

17:40.755 --> 17:43.975
pizza toppings, what color
to paint the damn walls.

17:44.019 --> 17:46.848
I've heard Tally
yell at him hundreds of times.

17:46.891 --> 17:48.937
But she never tried to kill him.

17:48.980 --> 17:50.460
She loved her brother.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.593
So, tell me about the party.
Who was there?

17:52.636 --> 17:54.029
Who wasn't?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.205
The whole thing got out
of control pretty quickly.

17:56.249 --> 17:58.642
It was supposed to be,
like, 20 of our friends,

17:58.686 --> 18:00.644
but, uh, I think everyone
got kind of carried away

18:00.688 --> 18:02.385
with the plus-one thing.

18:02.429 --> 18:04.561
Everyone was drinking,
or doing whatever.

18:04.605 --> 18:07.347
And at one point
I looked around and realized

18:07.390 --> 18:09.523
I didn't know who
half the people were.

18:09.566 --> 18:11.612
Now, when you say
"drinking or whatever,"

18:11.655 --> 18:13.004
are you referring to drugs?

18:13.048 --> 18:15.268
I didn't use the word "drugs."

18:15.311 --> 18:17.966
I'm saying people were partying,

18:18.009 --> 18:19.924
and some were partying
quite hard.

18:19.968 --> 18:23.276
So you've got this big loft.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.278
It's filled with people.

18:25.321 --> 18:28.542
Many of whom you suspect
are total strangers.

18:28.585 --> 18:29.978
People are consuming alcohol,

18:30.021 --> 18:32.415
maybe other things--

18:32.459 --> 18:34.243
isn't it reasonable to suspect

18:34.287 --> 18:35.897
that any one
of a number of people

18:35.940 --> 18:37.594
could have killed
your friend Torin?

18:37.638 --> 18:39.292
Objection.
Relevance.

18:39.335 --> 18:40.728
Not to mention
he's leading the witness.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.512
Not to mention
he's asking him for an opinion

18:42.556 --> 18:44.688
based on speculation.
Not to mention...

18:44.732 --> 18:47.952
I get it.
Objection sustained.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.128
Mr. Colón?

18:49.171 --> 18:51.739
No further questions.

18:51.782 --> 18:54.089
He did that on purpose,
didn't he?

18:54.133 --> 18:55.743
He knew that
it was against the rules,

18:55.786 --> 18:57.527
but he wanted the jury to think
about all those other people,

18:57.571 --> 18:58.746
how any one of them
could have done it.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.574
Shh, you're giving away
all my secrets.

19:00.617 --> 19:01.575
MARISSA [over earbud]:
We just jumped

19:01.618 --> 19:04.708
from one green juror to three.

19:04.752 --> 19:08.712
Mr. Lambert, I'd like
to revisit the fight

19:08.756 --> 19:10.932
the defendant and the victim
were having that evening.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.716
Do you know what they
were fighting about?

19:12.760 --> 19:14.544
I do.
Torin had filed

19:14.588 --> 19:16.807
for legal guardianship
of his sister.

19:16.851 --> 19:19.332
Torin was very protective
of Tally.

19:19.375 --> 19:20.594
Okay, but you can be
protective without

19:20.637 --> 19:22.987
filing for guardianship.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.468
Do you have any idea
what possessed him

19:25.512 --> 19:27.992
to seek a court order
declaring that his sister

19:28.036 --> 19:29.733
was unable to manage
her own affairs?

19:29.777 --> 19:33.433
Not specifically,
just that, uh...

19:33.476 --> 19:35.696
she was becoming
more and more of a challenge

19:35.739 --> 19:36.827
to control.

19:36.871 --> 19:39.569
Her safety,
her spending,

19:39.613 --> 19:41.745
her temper...I'm sorry, did you
say "her temper"?

19:41.789 --> 19:44.226
I didn't mean it like that.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.533
I-It's what I said before.
They'd argue.

19:46.576 --> 19:48.709
But I don't think
he was scared of her.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.319
I don't think anyone
was scared of her.

19:50.363 --> 19:53.017
More, uh, worriedfor her.

19:53.061 --> 19:55.759
And, I mean,
he'd tell me how, sometimes,

19:55.803 --> 19:59.372
she'd stay out all night.
I mean, she's...

19:59.415 --> 20:02.723
she's beautiful. She's going
to attract attention.

20:02.766 --> 20:04.115
It's a lot for a
28-year-old guy

20:04.159 --> 20:07.336
to deal with or worry about.

20:07.380 --> 20:09.338
So, I think he felt that

20:09.382 --> 20:11.427
both of their lives
might improve

20:11.471 --> 20:14.691
if she were in a place
that was set up

20:14.735 --> 20:18.652
to deal with people
with her kind of challenges.

20:18.695 --> 20:20.567
Torin did it

20:20.610 --> 20:23.700
so that he could get her
the help that she needed.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.659
It was for her protection.

20:25.702 --> 20:27.835
Her protection?
Are you sure?

20:27.878 --> 20:29.663
Well, what else could it be?

20:29.706 --> 20:32.535
Are you sure it wasn't
for his protection as well?Your Honor,

20:32.579 --> 20:33.623
I object.

20:33.667 --> 20:34.885
The counselor
is testifying

20:34.929 --> 20:37.845
andleading the witness and...

20:37.888 --> 20:39.847
Thanks, Mr. Colón.
I'll take it from here.

20:39.890 --> 20:41.457
Objection sustained.

20:41.501 --> 20:43.372
Please get to the
point, Counselor.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.679
Apologies, Your Honor.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.811
So, did Torin
tell you why he felt

20:47.855 --> 20:49.248
he needed protection
from his sister?

20:49.291 --> 20:50.249
Objection!

20:50.292 --> 20:52.686
Hearsay.
No foundation.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.296
What are we doing here,
Your Honor?

20:54.340 --> 20:55.863
Sustained.

20:55.906 --> 20:57.647
The ice is incredibly thin

20:57.691 --> 21:00.084
where you're standing,
Ms. Scrivener.

21:00.128 --> 21:02.043
I understand, Your Honor.

21:02.086 --> 21:04.045
Let's come at this
another way.

21:04.088 --> 21:05.655
When you would
see them together,

21:05.699 --> 21:08.136
brother and sister,
how did Torin appear--

21:08.179 --> 21:09.790
did he look comfortable?

21:11.095 --> 21:13.750
Sometimes yes.
Sometimes no.

21:13.794 --> 21:14.882
What about the night
of the party--

21:14.925 --> 21:16.362
did he look scared?

21:21.062 --> 21:24.065
She was smashing liquor bottles.

21:24.108 --> 21:27.721
He looked like he was afraid
she was gonna snap

21:27.764 --> 21:30.114
and hurt somebody.
Hurt him.

21:32.334 --> 21:34.554
I think we all
felt the same way.

21:34.597 --> 21:36.860
MARISSA:
Forget that thing I said
about three greens.

21:36.904 --> 21:38.819
No further questions
for this witness.

21:41.909 --> 21:43.780
I really don't have
any new news.

21:43.824 --> 21:47.349
Still trying to nail down
our mystery man in the red cap.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.351
TAYLOR:
I'm still knee-deep

21:49.395 --> 21:51.266
in the social media
of it all.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.573
Trying to fill in some
of those gray boxes.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.012
I really need
to leave now.

21:58.055 --> 21:59.274
Pick up my son.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.894
Can I throw a crazy
idea out there?

22:12.374 --> 22:15.334
Are we missing
the obvious?

22:15.377 --> 22:17.248
And if we weren't
representing her,

22:17.292 --> 22:19.816
wouldn't she be our
number-one suspect?

22:21.122 --> 22:22.341
It's all there, Bull:

22:22.384 --> 22:25.431
means, motive
and opportunity.

22:25.474 --> 22:27.868
Are you sure--
really sure--

22:27.911 --> 22:29.739
that Tally
didn't do it?

22:29.783 --> 22:33.700
And if you stop for a second
to consider that maybe

22:33.743 --> 22:36.746
you think she's
innocent just because

22:36.790 --> 22:37.834
you want her to
be innocent.

22:37.878 --> 22:40.271
Easy, Chunk.Uh-uh.

22:40.315 --> 22:42.099
You keep saying that she
couldn't have done this.

22:42.143 --> 22:44.450
And that even
if she did do it,

22:44.493 --> 22:47.888
she never would've reversed
course to try to save him,

22:47.931 --> 22:51.500
because that requires empathy,
and she doesn't have that.

22:51.544 --> 22:53.328
But maybe she tried
to stop the bleeding

22:53.372 --> 22:55.330
to save herself.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.550
Maybe she regretted
what she'd done

22:57.593 --> 22:59.900
because she didn't
want to get caught.

23:01.945 --> 23:03.817
I'm sorry.

23:03.860 --> 23:06.036
But...Nothing
to be sorry for.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.822
I pay you to tell me
what you think.

23:08.865 --> 23:11.433
Thank you.

23:11.477 --> 23:13.000
You done?

23:14.305 --> 23:15.437
Yeah.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.874
Excellent.
I will see you all tomorrow.

23:21.965 --> 23:23.402
[scoffs quietly]

23:31.975 --> 23:35.065
You know, it took a lot
of courage for him to do that.

23:41.115 --> 23:43.639
Prosecution's
newest exhibit.

23:43.683 --> 23:45.336
They're presenting it tomorrow.

23:47.382 --> 23:50.167
Why didn't they send
this in last week?

23:50.211 --> 23:51.647
Because it didn't
exist last week.

23:51.691 --> 23:52.996
Guards did a sweep

23:53.040 --> 23:55.521
of Tally's cell this morning,
and there it was.

23:57.914 --> 23:59.046
[sighs]

23:59.089 --> 24:00.874
W-What is it?

24:05.400 --> 24:08.708
Well, at least we know
the jury won't be out long.

24:10.753 --> 24:13.277
[sighs] You want to tell me
what I'm looking at here?

24:14.365 --> 24:16.933
I was just doing
what you taught me.

24:16.977 --> 24:18.805
Fill in the blanks.

24:18.848 --> 24:21.416
When you have a blackout, sketch
the things you know, and then

24:21.460 --> 24:23.984
try and sketch
the things you don't.

24:25.072 --> 24:26.595
Make the unconscious
conscious,

24:26.639 --> 24:28.815
isn't that what
you always told me?

24:28.858 --> 24:30.991
The only things I know are the
things I'm hearing in court,

24:31.034 --> 24:34.298
so I started there.

24:34.342 --> 24:36.126
Just trying to process
the memory loss,

24:36.170 --> 24:38.172
see if it would jog something.

24:38.215 --> 24:40.261
For the record, it didn't.

24:40.304 --> 24:43.090
Mm-hmm.

24:43.133 --> 24:46.223
Oh, Tally.

24:46.267 --> 24:49.226
I think I may have
given you some horrible advice.

24:49.270 --> 24:51.098
What do you mean?

24:51.141 --> 24:54.101
I think I inadvertently
had you draw yourself

24:54.144 --> 24:55.494
into a guilty verdict.

25:01.543 --> 25:04.503
BENNY:
Miss North...

25:04.546 --> 25:06.722
you don't deny that those
are your drawings, do you?

25:06.766 --> 25:08.724
No, no.
They're mine.

25:08.768 --> 25:11.510
And you know,
more often than not,

25:11.553 --> 25:13.729
people accused of murder

25:13.773 --> 25:16.819
do not testify
at their own trials?

25:16.863 --> 25:19.256
The law does not
require them to,

25:19.300 --> 25:22.129
but you chose to try
and explain the drawings

25:22.172 --> 25:24.087
and to answer questions
about your brother's murder,

25:24.131 --> 25:25.349
isn't that correct?

25:25.393 --> 25:26.742
Yes.

25:26.786 --> 25:30.354
Tell us about these drawings.

25:32.269 --> 25:33.575
Well, I've always drawn.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.535
Ever since I could
hold a crayon.

25:36.578 --> 25:37.840
And my art has

25:37.884 --> 25:40.669
always tended
to be dark, violent.

25:40.713 --> 25:43.716
It actually used to worry me.

25:43.759 --> 25:45.587
And just to be clear,
the drawings that depict

25:45.631 --> 25:47.676
your brother's murder
were drawn

25:47.720 --> 25:50.853
after you were jailed,
correct?

25:50.897 --> 25:53.203
After you were
charged with Torin's murder,

25:53.247 --> 25:54.596
after the trial started?

25:54.640 --> 25:56.642
Yes, sir.So...

25:58.644 --> 25:59.993
This isn't you...

26:00.036 --> 26:02.909
planning your brother's death...

26:02.952 --> 26:05.041
fantasizing about killing him,

26:05.085 --> 26:06.826
imagining what it would be like?

26:06.869 --> 26:08.741
No.

26:08.784 --> 26:11.439
It's just me taking
elements of the murder,

26:11.482 --> 26:13.267
things I had heard
about here in court

26:13.310 --> 26:16.226
and piecing them together to see
if it would help me remember.

26:16.270 --> 26:18.489
Remember what?

26:19.534 --> 26:21.318
Anything.

26:21.362 --> 26:24.670
I have absolutely no memory
of anything that happened

26:24.713 --> 26:27.629
after I went to my bedroom,
after our disagreement.

26:27.673 --> 26:31.590
Up until I woke up and found
my brother dead on the floor.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.461
MARISSA [over earbud]:
You sure about this
next move, Bull?

26:33.504 --> 26:34.854
"Sure" is a strong word.

26:34.897 --> 26:37.073
I prefer
"what other choice do we have."

26:44.037 --> 26:46.909
Tally...

26:46.953 --> 26:49.390
are you sad
your brother's dead?

26:51.174 --> 26:52.828
No.

26:52.872 --> 26:55.396
[indistinct muttering]

26:56.658 --> 26:58.660
If I were you, I'd pull
a couple of dollar bills

26:58.704 --> 27:00.314
out of my wallet
and stare at 'em, 'cause that's

27:00.357 --> 27:02.664
the last green you're gonna
be seeing for a while.Order.

27:02.708 --> 27:05.232
Order, please.

27:09.279 --> 27:11.020
Do you want to explain?

27:12.065 --> 27:13.588
Look, I know it must be hard

27:13.632 --> 27:15.721
to understand how I work.

27:15.764 --> 27:18.724
What goes on in my head.

27:18.767 --> 27:21.248
I just don't feel
the same things you do.

27:21.291 --> 27:23.685
I don't get happy.

27:23.729 --> 27:26.645
I don't get sad.

27:26.688 --> 27:30.300
I find it really hard to care
about anyone other than myself.

27:35.262 --> 27:38.134
Of course...

27:38.178 --> 27:40.571
I can make you think I care.

27:44.575 --> 27:45.881
[cries]

27:51.191 --> 27:53.628
[sniffles]
But it's a trick.

27:53.672 --> 27:56.587
Something I learned
when I was very young.

27:56.631 --> 27:59.721
I could do it
when I fell off my bike, or...

27:59.765 --> 28:02.028
when I didn't get something
I wanted for my birthday.

28:02.071 --> 28:04.857
And then one day
I realized,

28:04.900 --> 28:06.685
"Oh.

28:06.728 --> 28:09.122
"This is what
they wanted me to do

28:09.165 --> 28:11.646
"when my goldfish died.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.736
I can do that
for them."

28:14.780 --> 28:16.564
And before you ask,

28:16.607 --> 28:18.131
yes.

28:18.174 --> 28:20.176
I know something is missing.

28:21.395 --> 28:24.267
Something is broken.

28:24.311 --> 28:25.573
Wrong.

28:26.617 --> 28:29.882
And I feel really
lonely because of that.

28:29.925 --> 28:33.755
I'm a part of a world
that I don't totally understand.

28:33.799 --> 28:36.671
And one that, for the most part,

28:36.715 --> 28:39.674
seems really frightened of me.

28:45.549 --> 28:48.639
So I'm gonna ask you
once again.

28:48.683 --> 28:51.773
Tally, are you sad
that your brother's dead?

28:51.817 --> 28:54.776
My brother was the only person
who ever loved me.

28:57.170 --> 28:59.738
He just did.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.175
Even though
I couldn't love him back.

29:06.962 --> 29:09.791
Why would I want
to make that go away?

29:11.837 --> 29:15.188
Oh, my goodness,
we just picked up a green.

29:15.231 --> 29:16.667
You sound surprised.

29:16.711 --> 29:20.019
I told you I was sure
it would work.

29:20.062 --> 29:22.325
My goodness, Ms. North,
you've had a lot of therapists

29:22.369 --> 29:23.674
in your short life,
haven't you?

29:23.718 --> 29:26.590
Relatively speaking, I suppose.Hmm.

29:26.634 --> 29:28.767
And isn't it true
that one of your therapists

29:28.810 --> 29:31.682
is now part of your
defense team, Dr. Jason Bull?

29:33.162 --> 29:34.685
It is.

29:34.729 --> 29:36.296
Can you identify
him for us?

29:36.339 --> 29:37.645
He's sitting right there.

29:39.299 --> 29:41.127
I'd like to play
a video excerpt

29:41.170 --> 29:44.043
from a session that you and
Dr. Bull had in June of 2003.

29:44.086 --> 29:46.393
I believe your
aunt just died

29:46.436 --> 29:49.265
in a car accident.

29:49.309 --> 29:52.573
I can't believe she's dead.

29:52.616 --> 29:54.401
I miss her so much.

29:54.444 --> 29:56.490
BULL [on video]:
Okay, Tally. Stop it.

29:56.533 --> 29:57.839
You're wasting my time.

29:57.883 --> 29:58.884
You're manufacturing
your response,

29:58.927 --> 30:00.755
not feeling an emotion.

30:00.799 --> 30:02.409
TALLY:
What are you talking about?

30:02.452 --> 30:04.803
She was my favorite aunt,
and I don't know

30:04.846 --> 30:06.805
how I'm gonna go on living.

30:06.848 --> 30:09.982
BULL:
I have every confidence
you'll find a way.

30:11.505 --> 30:13.550
You always know, don't you?

30:13.594 --> 30:14.682
That's my job, Tally.

30:14.725 --> 30:17.076
Now tell me what
you're really feeling.

30:18.904 --> 30:20.819
How can you
expect this jury

30:20.862 --> 30:22.211
to believe a
word you say

30:22.255 --> 30:24.474
when you freely
confess to this jury,

30:24.518 --> 30:26.215
freely confess to your
own therapist--

30:26.259 --> 30:27.913
now a member
of your defense team--

30:27.956 --> 30:29.218
that your word,

30:29.262 --> 30:31.960
your behavior,
can't be trusted?

30:32.004 --> 30:34.223
That it's just a means
to an end, something that

30:34.267 --> 30:36.704
you do because you know
other people expect it?

30:36.747 --> 30:37.923
Objection, Your Honor.

30:37.966 --> 30:40.229
Is the prosecutor
going to ask a question

30:40.273 --> 30:41.927
or continue giving
her closing argument

30:41.970 --> 30:43.493
in the middle of the trial?

30:43.537 --> 30:45.321
Objection sustained.
The jury will disregard

30:45.365 --> 30:47.323
A.D.A. Scrivener's
last statement.

30:47.367 --> 30:49.108
No, they won't.

30:49.151 --> 30:50.849
Ask a question, Counselor.

30:50.892 --> 30:53.242
I have no further questions,
Your Honor.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.857
Hey.
[speaking Spanish]

30:59.770 --> 31:00.859
Ah...

31:06.038 --> 31:07.387
[speaks Spanish]

31:07.430 --> 31:09.911
Gracias.Ah, ah, ah, no, no,
no, no. Come on.

31:09.955 --> 31:11.217
Don't you dare.Okay. All right.

31:11.260 --> 31:12.827
Don't you dare.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.873
[speaks Spanish]

31:17.571 --> 31:18.920
Why don't you
just use a card?

31:18.964 --> 31:20.182
[chuckles]

31:20.226 --> 31:22.184
Uh, you know, I just
have so much extra cash

31:22.228 --> 31:24.056
lying around,
I would feel stupid

31:24.099 --> 31:25.709
if I didn't
use it. Gracias.

31:25.753 --> 31:27.929
I'm serious.

31:27.973 --> 31:30.845
I mean, it's not like
you work at a toll booth

31:30.889 --> 31:32.151
and take home free samples.[laughs]

31:32.194 --> 31:34.327
How come I've never seen
you use a credit card?

31:34.370 --> 31:35.937
Yeah, well, I'm taking it slow.

31:35.981 --> 31:38.853
You know, I show you
all my fascinating aspects--

31:38.897 --> 31:42.117
my-my credit cards,
my 401[k], my yacht--

31:42.161 --> 31:43.771
I show you all that too soon,

31:43.814 --> 31:46.295
there won't be
any mystery left, you know?

31:46.339 --> 31:48.123
[phone vibrates]

31:48.167 --> 31:50.082
One second.

31:50.125 --> 31:52.084
Oh, it's work.

31:52.127 --> 31:54.260
Man, you know, every time
I'm convinced they're not

31:54.303 --> 31:56.740
coming back to the office
after court, they do.

31:56.784 --> 32:00.179
And every time I'm sure they're
coming back, they don't.

32:00.222 --> 32:03.922
I'm sorry. I got to go.It's okay.

32:03.965 --> 32:06.620
Next time on me.
Hmm?Yes.

32:09.014 --> 32:12.843
Yeah. And next time
maybe I'll show you my yacht.

32:13.888 --> 32:15.194
DANNY:
So I was able

32:15.237 --> 32:17.674
to ID our mystery man
in the red baseball cap.

32:17.718 --> 32:19.720
The thing is,
he's not our killer.

32:19.763 --> 32:20.808
His name is Brian Davidson.

32:20.851 --> 32:22.897
And he left the party
around 11:00,

32:22.941 --> 32:25.987
then he got arrested at 12:30.

32:26.031 --> 32:28.424
The murder happened
around 3:00 a.m.

32:28.468 --> 32:31.471
So unless he snuck out of jail
to do it, he's not our guy.

32:31.514 --> 32:32.994
What was he arrested for?

32:33.038 --> 32:34.691
Selling drugs.

32:34.735 --> 32:37.477
Marijuana, cocaine,
MDMA, roofies.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.305
Roofies?

32:41.960 --> 32:43.744
Tally keeps insisting
the blackout

32:43.787 --> 32:46.312
she had at the party
felt different.

32:46.355 --> 32:49.489
Normally, she has fragments
of memory from her fugues,

32:49.532 --> 32:50.881
but this last one...

32:50.925 --> 32:52.492
Are you thinking
maybe Tally wasn't

32:52.535 --> 32:54.189
in a dissociative fugue at all?

32:54.233 --> 32:56.975
That maybe she was roofied?

32:57.018 --> 32:59.499
You think this Brian Davidson's
still in custody?

32:59.542 --> 33:00.891
I'm sure of it.

33:00.935 --> 33:01.936
I feel like paying him a visit.

33:07.637 --> 33:08.725
BENNY:
Mr. Lambert,

33:08.769 --> 33:10.597
any idea why we called you back?

33:10.640 --> 33:12.773
None whatsoever.

33:12.816 --> 33:14.383
Brian Davidson,

33:14.427 --> 33:17.473
a man arrested
for the possession

33:17.517 --> 33:19.693
of illegal narcotics
shortly after

33:19.736 --> 33:22.652
leaving the party the evening
Torin North was killed,

33:22.696 --> 33:25.046
identified you

33:25.090 --> 33:28.702
as having purchased
flunitrazepam from him.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.704
You, and only you.

33:30.747 --> 33:32.836
I mean,
other people

33:32.880 --> 33:34.795
purchased
other drugs,

33:34.838 --> 33:38.625
but only you purchased
flunitrazepam from him.

33:38.668 --> 33:42.063
You know what flunitrazepam is,
don't you?

33:42.107 --> 33:44.674
No, I'm not sure I do.

33:44.718 --> 33:47.764
Roofies.
Flunitrazepam is roofies.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.810
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance?

33:49.853 --> 33:52.160
Mr. North didn't die of
a flunitrazepam overdose.

33:52.204 --> 33:55.990
I know this seems
a little out of the blue,

33:56.034 --> 33:58.993
but I promise it will all
prove completely relevant

33:59.037 --> 34:02.301
if Your Honor would just let me
get to where I need to go.

34:02.344 --> 34:04.651
Objection overruled.
Continue, Mr. Colón.

34:04.694 --> 34:06.653
Thank you, Your Honor.

34:06.696 --> 34:08.829
Mr. Lambert, did you, in fact,

34:08.872 --> 34:12.093
purchase roofies that night?

34:12.137 --> 34:13.877
Well, yeah,

34:13.921 --> 34:16.402
when you call them
roofies, yeah.

34:16.445 --> 34:18.534
[gallery murmuring]

34:18.578 --> 34:22.364
May I ask why
you purchased roofies?

34:22.408 --> 34:26.064
Well, I have trouble
sleeping when I drink.

34:26.107 --> 34:28.414
They knock me out.

34:28.457 --> 34:32.374
Seems like a rather
extreme solution.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.724
So be it.

34:34.768 --> 34:37.640
So, tell me,
did you use these roofies

34:37.684 --> 34:40.426
while you were at the party?

34:40.469 --> 34:43.777
No.
I waited till I got home.

34:43.820 --> 34:45.170
Till it was time
to go to sleep.

34:45.213 --> 34:47.998
Uh, did you perhaps
inadvertently give some roofies

34:48.042 --> 34:49.783
to anyone else that evening?

34:49.826 --> 34:51.915
Slip them
in their drink, perhaps?

34:51.959 --> 34:54.875
No. O-Of course not.
Why would I do that?

34:54.918 --> 34:58.357
Well, it is also called
the date rape drug.

34:58.400 --> 35:00.576
Your Honor,
where are we going with this?

35:00.620 --> 35:02.361
Mr. Colón, I need you bring this

35:02.404 --> 35:03.753
to some sort
of meaningful conclusion.

35:03.797 --> 35:07.061
Yes, Your Honor.
Of course, Your Honor.

35:07.105 --> 35:10.064
Mr. Lambert,
is it your testimony

35:10.108 --> 35:13.328
that the only person
who consumed these roofies

35:13.372 --> 35:15.852
you purchased that evening
was yourself?

35:15.896 --> 35:19.160
As far as I'm aware, yes.

35:19.204 --> 35:22.294
Your Honor, I'd like
to introduce into evidence

35:22.337 --> 35:23.947
this party cup

35:23.991 --> 35:26.776
taken from the defendant's room

35:26.820 --> 35:28.126
at the night of the murder.

35:28.169 --> 35:29.910
Objection, Your Honor.
Foundation?

35:29.953 --> 35:33.653
BENNY:
I refer exhibit 172,

35:33.696 --> 35:36.569
a time-stamped
crime scene photo

35:36.612 --> 35:40.050
showing this cup originally
found in the room.

35:40.094 --> 35:42.052
This is one and the same.

35:42.096 --> 35:43.663
I'll allow it.

35:43.706 --> 35:44.925
Yeah, we'll also
be introducing

35:44.968 --> 35:48.102
into evidence a report,
Your Honor, detailing

35:48.146 --> 35:49.886
that trace amounts
of flunitrazepam

35:49.930 --> 35:52.237
were found inside of the cup,

35:52.280 --> 35:54.717
as well as Blake Lambert's
fingerprints,

35:54.761 --> 35:57.459
which were found on the outside.

35:57.503 --> 35:59.722
Uh, and there was another
set of fingerprints

35:59.766 --> 36:02.290
that were found on
there, too, Mr. Lambert.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.118
Tally North's.

36:04.162 --> 36:07.382
Okay. Maybe she handed me
the cup or something.

36:07.426 --> 36:08.818
I don't remember.

36:08.862 --> 36:10.951
Did you drug Tally North?

36:10.994 --> 36:12.822
[gallery murmuring]

36:12.866 --> 36:14.868
[gavel bangs]

36:14.911 --> 36:17.262
Let the witness answer, please.

36:19.742 --> 36:21.222
No.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.920
No.

36:23.964 --> 36:26.401
Do you happen
to remember a woman

36:26.445 --> 36:29.056
by the name of Leah Carpenter?

36:29.099 --> 36:30.797
SCRIVENER:
Objection.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.015
Again, relevance?

36:32.059 --> 36:33.930
Your Honor, please.

36:33.974 --> 36:36.846
I promise we're almost there.

36:36.890 --> 36:40.241
Overruled. Witness will
answer the question.

36:42.287 --> 36:43.549
Yes.

36:43.592 --> 36:45.115
Yes! Yes.

36:45.159 --> 36:47.205
She attended
Rennich University with you,

36:47.248 --> 36:49.381
and she accused you
of date rape.

36:49.424 --> 36:51.861
Putting something in her drink,
then following her back

36:51.905 --> 36:55.909
to her dorm room and holding
her down and you know the rest.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.258
This is completely unfair.

36:57.302 --> 37:00.261
That was just...
that was a misunderstanding.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.394
No one pressed charges.

37:02.437 --> 37:04.134
We have their full attention,

37:04.178 --> 37:07.050
but we sill haven't
changed enough minds.

37:07.094 --> 37:08.835
Oh, trust me,
their minds are changed.

37:08.878 --> 37:10.228
They're just
too damned entertained

37:10.271 --> 37:12.055
to take a minute
and let us know.

37:12.099 --> 37:13.231
BENNY:
The night of the party,

37:13.274 --> 37:14.928
did you follow Tally
back to her room?

37:14.971 --> 37:16.799
No.Did you hold her down?

37:16.843 --> 37:19.149
No.Did you rip her shirt?
Bruise her skin?

37:19.193 --> 37:22.979
No.Did Torin, her brother Torin--
your best friend Torin--

37:23.023 --> 37:26.156
walk in on you taking advantage
of his comatose sister?!

37:26.200 --> 37:28.158
No, no, no!

37:28.202 --> 37:30.204
You can't prove that!

37:34.121 --> 37:36.123
Nothing further, Your Honor.

37:40.606 --> 37:42.564
Reasonable doubt.

37:42.608 --> 37:46.002
Uh, you look it up
in the dictionary,

37:46.046 --> 37:49.789
and there'd be a picture
of all of us sitting here today.

37:49.832 --> 37:52.574
There'd also be a definition.

37:53.836 --> 37:56.274
Something along the lines of...

37:56.317 --> 37:59.146
"Lack of proof

37:59.189 --> 38:01.322
"that prevents a judge or a jury

38:01.366 --> 38:04.238
"from convicting a defendant

38:04.282 --> 38:06.762
for the charged crime."[mouths]

38:08.242 --> 38:09.765
Only Torin North and his killer

38:09.809 --> 38:12.942
know exactly what happened
in that room.

38:12.986 --> 38:16.119
But you've heard
all the evidence.

38:17.599 --> 38:19.340
Or have you?

38:19.384 --> 38:21.734
I've yet to hear
a single piece of evidence

38:21.777 --> 38:24.693
that points
to my client having done this.

38:24.737 --> 38:28.480
But I've heard a great deal
to suggest an alternate theory.

38:28.523 --> 38:31.178
I believe that...

38:31.221 --> 38:33.049
Torin walked in

38:33.093 --> 38:36.052
on his best friend Blake Lambert

38:36.096 --> 38:40.100
standing over
his semi-conscious sister.

38:40.143 --> 38:41.971
Her shirt ripped,

38:42.015 --> 38:44.974
her arms bruised.
And he was

38:45.018 --> 38:47.281
fiercely protective
of his sister.

38:47.325 --> 38:51.024
So he did
what any brother would do.

38:51.067 --> 38:54.027
Blake fought back.

38:54.070 --> 38:57.335
Grabbed the scissors
from Tally's desk

38:57.378 --> 38:59.946
and plunged them
into his best friend's neck.

38:59.989 --> 39:03.297
And as Torin's blood spilled
on an unconscious Tally,

39:03.341 --> 39:05.386
he had a moment
of regret.

39:05.430 --> 39:07.649
He doesn't suffer from ASPD--

39:07.693 --> 39:09.390
antisocial personality disorder.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.000
No.

39:11.044 --> 39:13.133
No, no.

39:13.176 --> 39:16.005
He's just
an old-fashioned rapist

39:16.049 --> 39:18.051
who suddenly realized

39:18.094 --> 39:20.053
that he might have
killed his best friend,

39:20.096 --> 39:22.098
so he tried to stop
the bleeding.

39:22.142 --> 39:24.405
Realized that
wasn't going to work,

39:24.449 --> 39:27.626
so he wiped the murder weapon,

39:27.669 --> 39:31.064
and left Tally
passed out on the bed.

39:31.107 --> 39:33.849
So that when she came to,

39:33.893 --> 39:37.070
confronted with
her brother's slain body,

39:37.113 --> 39:38.854
and having no memory
of what happened

39:38.898 --> 39:40.552
due to the flunitrazepam,

39:40.595 --> 39:44.077
she'd be forced
to carry around the knowledge

39:44.120 --> 39:46.471
that she might have done this.

39:46.514 --> 39:49.256
That it was
her fault,

39:49.299 --> 39:51.040
her doing,

39:51.084 --> 39:53.478
her crime.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.177
But she didn't.

39:57.220 --> 39:58.961
She didn't do it.

39:59.005 --> 40:02.443
Tally is simply
just another victim, and-and...

40:02.487 --> 40:05.446
what an obscene joke
that is.

40:05.490 --> 40:08.928
You know, the person
responsible for this crime

40:08.971 --> 40:11.844
is trusting that you, the jury,

40:11.887 --> 40:14.455
will lean on your
own preconceived notions

40:14.499 --> 40:17.850
on what it means
to be a sociopath,

40:17.893 --> 40:20.069
what it means to be
devoid of emotion,

40:20.113 --> 40:23.464
what it means
to be mentally ill.

40:23.508 --> 40:26.554
The killer's counting on it.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.948
And so is the A.D.A.

40:30.776 --> 40:33.561
But Tally and I
know you know better.

40:33.605 --> 40:36.129
In fact, she's betting
her life on it.

40:36.172 --> 40:37.522
Thank you.

40:43.310 --> 40:45.878
JUDGE:
Has the jury reached a verdict?

40:45.921 --> 40:48.141
We have, Your Honor.

40:48.184 --> 40:50.143
We, the jury,
find the defendant,

40:50.186 --> 40:52.232
Tally North...

40:52.275 --> 40:55.104
not guilty
of the murder of Torin North.

40:55.148 --> 40:56.628
[gallery murmuring]

40:58.194 --> 41:00.153
It's okay.

41:00.196 --> 41:02.198
It's about you.

41:05.854 --> 41:08.466
So what happens now?

41:08.509 --> 41:11.294
I found something

41:11.338 --> 41:13.296
that I'd like you to consider.

41:13.340 --> 41:15.908
It's a residential facility.

41:15.951 --> 41:17.910
No locks. You can leave
any time you want.

41:17.953 --> 41:20.042
Just sign yourself out.

41:20.086 --> 41:22.044
It's all
in your control.

41:22.088 --> 41:23.872
But you have
a room there.

41:23.916 --> 41:26.135
Everything is set
and ready for you,

41:26.179 --> 41:29.443
and if it's not the right fit,
we'll find you something else.

41:29.487 --> 41:33.273
It's what your brother
wanted for you--

41:33.316 --> 41:36.798
to get back to that sense
of feigned normalcy.

41:36.842 --> 41:38.408
Feigned normalcy.

41:38.452 --> 41:40.585
Something we can all aspire to.

41:40.628 --> 41:44.197
You know, when you left me
all those years ago,

41:44.240 --> 41:46.242
I understood.

41:46.286 --> 41:49.071
I didn't like it, but..

41:49.115 --> 41:50.551
I understood.

41:50.595 --> 41:53.946
And I also felt,
strongly, somehow,

41:53.989 --> 41:57.776
that... you weren't
really gone forever.

41:59.734 --> 42:01.257
And you weren't.

42:04.217 --> 42:06.567
Thank you for being there.

42:10.049 --> 42:12.268
Oh.

42:12.312 --> 42:14.575
Tally...

42:14.619 --> 42:16.534
thank you for saying that.

42:18.361 --> 42:20.189
I'm just messing with you.

42:20.233 --> 42:22.583
So where's this place

42:22.627 --> 42:25.020
you want me to try?

42:25.064 --> 42:26.239
Well...

42:26.282 --> 42:28.284
