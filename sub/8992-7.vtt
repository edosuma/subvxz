00:01.001 --> 00:02.002
<i>Previously on</i> Recovery Road...

00:02.002 --> 00:04.463
I was wondering if you'd
want to come work for me?

00:04.463 --> 00:07.007
And how long
have you been sober?

00:07.007 --> 00:10.511
I'm not in recovery.
I'm just a counselor.

00:10.511 --> 00:11.637
It all looks
the same to me.

00:11.637 --> 00:14.223
It's no fun doing
all of the stuff by myself.

00:14.223 --> 00:17.184
This little girl,
she is Trish.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.061
Please go.
I wouldn't want to have
to call the police.

00:19.061 --> 00:22.648
Did one of them slip you
their card while they were
handcuffing you?

00:22.648 --> 00:25.025
(laughing)

00:25.025 --> 00:26.151
<i>Maddie, I know</i>
<i>something's up with you.</i>

00:26.151 --> 00:29.029
‐Nothing's up.
<i>‐Keeping stuff in,</i>
<i>ain't good for you.</i>

00:29.029 --> 00:31.365
Just coming to pick up Maddie.
We're going to dinner.

00:31.365 --> 00:32.407
Hi, Mom.

00:32.407 --> 00:34.159
She's not going to dinner
with her mom, is she?

00:34.159 --> 00:37.829
What if I agree to be
your temporary sponsor?

00:37.829 --> 00:38.997
Okay, I guess.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.749
Maybe, just
don't tell your mom.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.876
‐My priority is us.
‐Mine too.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.253
Cynthia:
<i>You know I have commitments.</i>

00:44.253 --> 00:47.089
Ellie:
<i>When she left last night,</i>
<i>I decided to finish her drink.</i>

00:47.089 --> 00:48.840
<i>It was water.</i>

00:48.840 --> 00:51.551
Maddie:
<i>Sometimes it's fun</i>
<i>being the new girl.</i>

00:51.551 --> 00:54.304
Yeah, at my old school,
we had a strict dress code.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.223
And no,
I don't play any sports.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.266
I hate sports.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.142
Ellie, did you meet
the new girl yet?

00:59.142 --> 01:00.519
She's really pretty.

01:00.519 --> 01:02.938
Like, what has
humanity come to

01:02.938 --> 01:06.441
as we sit around and watch
dudes ram into each other
and get brain injuries?

01:06.441 --> 01:08.235
And we get excited
about who wins?

01:08.235 --> 01:10.195
Like we have anything
to do with their success
or failure?

01:10.195 --> 01:11.780
Bring back the Colosseum.

01:11.780 --> 01:13.657
Same thing,
way more interesting.

01:13.657 --> 01:15.450
(laughing)

01:16.868 --> 01:18.787
Oh, hey,
there's uncle Jonah.

01:20.455 --> 01:22.165
Earth to Zack.

01:22.165 --> 01:24.084
We have to go.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.796
All right,
the usual for you, sir.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.340
half‐cherry, half‐blue
raspberry Slurpee,

01:30.340 --> 01:32.634
pizza flavored...
something or others,

01:32.634 --> 01:34.219
and gummy worms.

01:37.139 --> 01:40.267
Comparing pro sports
to people dying
in ancient Rome?

01:40.267 --> 01:41.393
Come on.

01:41.393 --> 01:43.395
She was just being funny.

01:43.395 --> 01:46.273
Says the guy who spent
five hours building a fantasy
baseball team yesterday.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.233
She was trying so hard.

01:49.609 --> 01:51.486
You really think she's funny?

01:51.486 --> 01:54.323
You never know, Elle,
you two could be friends.

01:54.323 --> 01:56.283
Maybe you should put
yourself out there,

01:56.283 --> 01:57.993
take the risk.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.341
(sighs)

02:14.509 --> 02:17.262
Ugh. That's disgusting.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.513
Eww.

02:18.513 --> 02:21.391
Eww, gross.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.186
What did you do
to piss Craig off?

02:24.186 --> 02:27.105
Solo Monday morning
bathroom cleanup?

02:27.105 --> 02:29.358
Mus have been
something pretty bad.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.652
Uh, actually,
I had duty with Trish.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.654
Right.

02:33.654 --> 02:37.157
She's currently unavailable
on account of her being sent
to a psychiatric hospital

02:37.157 --> 02:39.409
for evaluation
of her fake baby.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.286
Which is normal.
Totally normal.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.455
Everything is normal,
everything's okay.

02:43.455 --> 02:46.083
Yeah. Everything is okay.

02:47.167 --> 02:48.919
And you know what?

02:48.919 --> 02:50.629
I got a couple minutes.

02:50.629 --> 02:53.382
Well, get some gloves.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.008
Get your gloves on.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.343
Thank you.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.220
No worries.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.185
Oh, hi.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.520
‐Hi.
‐Hi.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.900
Uh, I was just, um,

03:11.900 --> 03:13.568
just driving
Maddie to school.

03:15.404 --> 03:16.863
Come on.

03:16.863 --> 03:19.616
Put some elbow grease
into it. Get your Cinderelly on.

03:19.616 --> 03:20.951
‐My Cinderelly?
‐Uh‐huh.

03:20.951 --> 03:21.993
(laughing)

03:21.993 --> 03:25.288
Long story... long. Um,

03:25.288 --> 03:28.417
uh, you were great yesterday.

03:28.417 --> 03:33.130
It was a scary situation,
and you were strong
and kind

03:33.130 --> 03:37.175
and open, and just... great.

03:37.175 --> 03:38.969
Everyone here‐‐
I mean,

03:38.969 --> 03:40.303
the residents,

03:40.303 --> 03:42.389
they're lucky to have you.

03:42.389 --> 03:46.393
(laughing)

03:46.393 --> 03:48.311
Oh my goodness, Wes!

03:48.311 --> 03:49.688
(laughing)

03:49.688 --> 03:51.690
Thank you.

03:51.690 --> 03:53.358

‐Uh...

04:58.173 --> 04:59.216

I concur.

05:17.526 --> 05:18.527
I have to go.

05:18.527 --> 05:19.694
‐I have to get‐‐
‐To work.

05:19.694 --> 05:21.321
‐School.
‐With your mom.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.198
Wow. Right. Okay.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.283
I'm gonna tell Craig
about the sink.

05:25.283 --> 05:26.576
Cool.

05:34.459 --> 05:35.460
(sighs)

05:38.672 --> 05:39.798
Hi, how are you?

05:39.798 --> 05:40.799
Nothing.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.094
I mean, I'm good.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.470
‐Good. Me too.
‐I can't‐‐

05:45.470 --> 05:46.721
Seat belt.

05:47.764 --> 05:49.099
‐Yes.
‐Good.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.685
We are good.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.564
Maddie:
<i>I made out with Wes.</i>

05:55.564 --> 05:57.190
<i>And Trish had a fantasy baby.</i>

05:57.190 --> 05:59.025
<i>And I made out with Wes.</i>

05:59.025 --> 06:01.069
<i>Did I actually make</i>
<i>out with Wes?</i>

06:01.069 --> 06:03.405
<i>Meanwhile Zack is my boyfriend.</i>

06:03.405 --> 06:05.866
<i>Wes's mouth tastes like</i>
<i>something really good.</i>

06:05.866 --> 06:07.117
<i>What is it?</i>

06:07.117 --> 06:08.535
<i>It's like, familiar...</i>

06:08.535 --> 06:10.829
<i>ChapStick?</i>
<i>Cinnamon?</i>

06:10.829 --> 06:12.706
<i>Oh, I think it's bubble gum.</i>

06:12.706 --> 06:13.748
Are you even listening?

06:13.748 --> 06:14.916
Yeah, she's in crisis
mode here.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.335
‐Am not.
‐I was talking about Ellie.

06:17.335 --> 06:18.670
‐Yeah.
‐Oh.

06:18.670 --> 06:20.547
Rewind?

06:20.547 --> 06:24.467
Okay. If I want to get into
the Young Ambassadors program,

06:24.467 --> 06:27.596
I have to bring my grade
in American History up to an A‐,

06:27.596 --> 06:29.723
and I studied the Gold Rush
chapter

06:29.723 --> 06:32.058
literally, for, no joke,
13 hours,

06:32.058 --> 06:33.894
and went through five sets
of note cards,

06:33.894 --> 06:37.564
and I got a friggin' 92
on the test!

06:37.564 --> 06:41.359
I got a 92,
and a 92 is like one of those

06:41.359 --> 06:43.862
framed "Good Job" certificates
that you print off clip art.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.447
It means nothing to me.

06:48.033 --> 06:50.577
I... I don't...

06:50.577 --> 06:52.746
I honestly don't know what
you want me to do about this?

06:55.665 --> 06:57.292
Oh, okay.

06:57.292 --> 06:58.335
Pep talk. I got this.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.045
Um...

07:00.045 --> 07:02.464
You'll crush the paper,

07:02.464 --> 07:05.216
and that's a big chunk
of our grade.

07:05.216 --> 07:07.385
And hey, a 92?

07:07.385 --> 07:09.596
The things I'd do
for a 92 in American History.

07:09.596 --> 07:13.475
I'd dress up like Paul Revere
for a whole freaking semester
for a 92.

07:15.060 --> 07:17.562
And that's an improvement.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.940
You know what they say,
it's progress, not perfection.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.153
Ugh.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.698
(humming)

08:09.698 --> 08:13.243
Craig, there is literally, like,
18 cartons of milk in here.

08:13.243 --> 08:15.245
We need to institute
a new system.

08:15.245 --> 08:16.913
Ugh, this one has
been in here

08:16.913 --> 08:19.666
since that ayahuasca guy
Andreas left eight months ago.

08:19.666 --> 08:20.709
Disgusting.

08:20.709 --> 08:23.378
Institute a system, yes.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.672
Very good suggestion, Vern.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.550
Perhaps we'll get
a felt‐tipped pen and keep
it inside the fridge,

08:28.550 --> 08:30.051
so that people remember
to mark the bottles.

08:30.051 --> 08:32.137
‐I'll get on that.
‐Does soy milk go bad?

08:32.137 --> 08:33.513
Sudden interest in dairy?

08:33.513 --> 08:36.558
Cynthia's coming over
with cake leftovers.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.268
Cynthia? Leftovers?

08:38.268 --> 08:40.979
Yeah. Her wedding cake tasting.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.772
Paul's gone paleo
before the wedding,

08:42.772 --> 08:44.733
so he's only taking
one bite of each.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.234
Oh, right.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.986
Please, don't even
get me started.

08:47.986 --> 08:50.280
It's some kind of janky
philosophy about the diet
cavemen used to eat

08:50.280 --> 08:52.365
when we were all
hunter‐gatherers or whatever.

08:52.365 --> 08:55.285
His masochism is my gain.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.537
Yeah.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.624
(phone buzzing)

09:01.624 --> 09:03.084
Hi, Ellie.

09:03.084 --> 09:05.837
<i>Hi. Wanna get together</i>
<i>to work on the history paper?</i>

09:05.837 --> 09:10.008
<i>Maybe reward ourselves with</i>
<i>a little manifest destiny</i>
<i>mocha latte afterwards?</i>

09:10.008 --> 09:12.469
<i>I think our forefathers</i>
<i>would maybe approve.</i>

09:12.469 --> 09:14.596
Uh, well, you know what?
I can't.

09:14.596 --> 09:16.389
<i>Dude, you always can't.</i>

09:16.389 --> 09:18.475
It's just, I'm in the middle
of doing some laundry.

09:18.475 --> 09:20.351
‐ <i>Oh, you're home?</i>
‐Yeah.

09:20.351 --> 09:22.103
(knocking)

09:23.396 --> 09:25.774
Uh, so, I'm sorry about that.

09:30.653 --> 09:31.863
What are you doing here?

09:31.863 --> 09:33.573
What are you doing here?

09:37.660 --> 09:38.953
I'm volunteering.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.914
Volunteering.
Is that what it is?

09:40.914 --> 09:42.457
Mm‐hmm.

09:42.457 --> 09:44.667
Yeah, I just decided
to check out

09:44.667 --> 09:49.297
the lone mixed‐gender
sober living place
in the Valencia area, so...

09:51.800 --> 09:53.676
Give it up, Maddie.

09:53.676 --> 09:55.303
Okay, fine.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.013
You want the truth?

09:57.013 --> 09:59.182
(sighs)

09:59.182 --> 10:01.726
I'm here visiting someone.

10:01.726 --> 10:03.728
Anyone I know?
Someone I could say hi to?

10:03.728 --> 10:05.146
No, actually,
you don't know her.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.148
Vern:
Oh my God, just tell her.

10:14.572 --> 10:17.200
I live here.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.743
Are you happy?

10:18.743 --> 10:21.704
Why would‐‐
Why would that make me happy?

10:21.704 --> 10:23.248
'Cause you have
everything you need now,

10:23.248 --> 10:25.834
to humiliate me,
to blackmail me,

10:25.834 --> 10:27.127
you know,
steal my boyfriend.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.753
Maddie, I'm here
because we're friends.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.923
Okay, let's cut
the condescending crap,
shall we, Ellie?

10:31.923 --> 10:34.008
We've never been real friends!

10:34.008 --> 10:36.386
So just get the hell
out of my house!

10:51.901 --> 10:52.735
How's Maddie?

10:52.735 --> 10:54.028
What?

10:54.028 --> 10:57.448
It sounds like you have
such a...

10:57.448 --> 10:59.951
good handle
on the program stuff.

10:59.951 --> 11:02.036
I just...

11:02.036 --> 11:04.455
wonder about her.

11:06.207 --> 11:09.210
I think Maddie's doing good.

11:09.210 --> 11:10.920
You can tell me the truth.

11:10.920 --> 11:11.713
Really.

11:11.713 --> 11:13.715
Lately, she's doing great.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.592
You know, it's hard
when you're like her.

11:15.592 --> 11:17.802
Smart, headstrong...

11:17.802 --> 11:19.762
‐Stubborn.
‐...stubborn.

11:19.762 --> 11:23.725
Can talk herself
into or out of anything.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.561
When you're like that,
it's hard to give yourself
over to the program.

11:26.561 --> 11:29.814
But she's making
really good progress.

11:29.814 --> 11:32.358
You know what, this
sponsor thing is huge, too.

11:32.358 --> 11:36.112
She and Cynthia seem
to get along really well,
so it's great.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.655
Cynthia's her sponsor?

11:37.655 --> 11:39.657
She's a serious lady, man.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.202
She actually had Maddie
doing sober homework yesterday,

11:42.202 --> 11:44.037
which I think,
actually, deep down

11:44.037 --> 11:45.496
Maddie really enjoys.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.291
You know, that kind of
discipline and structure.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.797
(phone chimes)

12:05.099 --> 12:07.143
The varnish needs to dry first,

12:07.143 --> 12:09.229
but, um, I was thinking

12:09.229 --> 12:12.649
maybe I could
come back on Wednesday
and hand distress it.

12:12.649 --> 12:13.775
(sighs)

12:16.277 --> 12:18.029
I'm sorry.
Did I say something wrong?

12:18.029 --> 12:18.821
No.

12:18.821 --> 12:20.865
No, no, no.
Not at all.

12:24.827 --> 12:27.038
This Maddie stuff
is just making me crazy.

12:27.038 --> 12:29.916
You and I both know that
that woman should not
be her sponsor.

12:29.916 --> 12:31.125
At least she has one.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.961
Well, it's just
making me insane.

12:32.961 --> 12:35.171
And I just can't seem
to get her

12:35.171 --> 12:39.008
or frankly, anyone
to make the right choices.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.302
And I feel like
I'm screaming into the void.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.013
What?

12:44.013 --> 12:45.056
Nothing.

12:45.056 --> 12:47.016
No.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.184
What were you gonna say?

12:50.228 --> 12:52.563
Do you know
what Al‐Anon is?

12:52.563 --> 12:54.065
Yeah.

12:54.065 --> 12:55.024
Yes, I do.

12:56.359 --> 12:58.653
But, you know what,
remind me again.

12:58.653 --> 13:00.780
It's a program,
12 steps,

13:00.780 --> 13:04.242
for people who are affected
by addicts and alcoholics.

13:04.242 --> 13:06.744
Friends, family, I'm a member.

13:06.744 --> 13:09.205
You can be in AA
and Al‐Anon?

13:09.205 --> 13:13.167
Yeah, well, a lot of alcoholics
have other alcoholics
in their lives, too.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.378
Actually, if you want
to check it out,

13:15.378 --> 13:17.505
there's a really great
six o'clock meeting

13:17.505 --> 13:19.590
at the Congregational Church.
I was gonna go tonight.

13:19.590 --> 13:23.011
Yeah, I know all about
the family disease thing.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.638
If you look at it this way,

13:25.638 --> 13:30.351
it teaches you how to let go
of the alcoholic's choices

13:30.351 --> 13:33.104
and stop trying
to control them. You know.

13:33.104 --> 13:35.773
But I'm not trying to control
Maddie. I'm trying to help
her get better.

13:35.773 --> 13:37.358
Right.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.943
Right, I'm sorry. It's just‐‐

13:38.943 --> 13:42.822
It's just you said that
Maddie's recovery was
making you feel crazy,

13:42.822 --> 13:44.949
and it can be a relief
to let go of that.

13:46.534 --> 13:47.577
How?

13:47.577 --> 13:51.080
By... By figuring out

13:51.080 --> 13:54.625
how you're codependent,
or sick.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.295
Al‐Anon isn't about
changing the addict.

13:57.295 --> 13:59.964
It's about you
and your recovery.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.925
Yeah, but what have I
ever done that's sick
or codependent, though?

14:06.888 --> 14:09.807
Go ahead,
I want to understand.

14:12.351 --> 14:14.062
Well, maybe, you know,

14:14.062 --> 14:19.192
signing Maddie out to dinner
with you on Saturday night.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.944
Oh. Mm‐hmm.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.116
I'm really sorry.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.577
It's just that honesty is
a big part of the program,

14:29.577 --> 14:31.996
and I'm sure that Maddie
manipulated you.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.832
Addicts can
be very manipulative,
trust me, I know.

14:34.832 --> 14:37.001
But I just think
that you should've
maybe gone to‐‐

14:37.001 --> 14:39.712
That's really helpful.
Thanks.

14:39.712 --> 14:41.589
I think we're done
for the day.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.094
‐See you on Wednesday?
‐I'll call you.

14:53.142 --> 14:53.976
Thank you.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.324
(phone ringing)

15:08.324 --> 15:09.367
Hello.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.952
Uh, hi, Cynthia.

15:10.952 --> 15:13.162
<i>Um, hope I'm not bothering you.</i>

15:13.162 --> 15:14.789
I'm not bothering you,
am I?

15:14.789 --> 15:17.834
No, no, no, no, it's fine.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.001
Is everything okay?

15:19.001 --> 15:20.795
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, no.

15:20.795 --> 15:22.713
<i>No, look, I just‐‐</i>

15:22.713 --> 15:24.757
I'm just calling
because this, uh...

15:24.757 --> 15:27.927
this morning
was really fantastic,

15:27.927 --> 15:31.639
<i>um, but it just</i>
<i>can't happen again.</i>

15:31.639 --> 15:33.391
I don't know
what I was thinking.

15:33.391 --> 15:34.892
I just wanted to,
you know, clarify.

15:34.892 --> 15:36.060
Yes. I'm‐‐

15:36.060 --> 15:39.021
I mean, that was
kind of understood.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.065
<i>‐Never again.</i>
‐Oh.

15:41.065 --> 15:42.567
Yes, of course,
it was understood.

15:42.567 --> 15:44.110
Right. Yeah. Um...

15:44.110 --> 15:45.403
And look, you know,
I understand,

15:45.403 --> 15:48.281
and I just wanted to make sure
that you understand,

15:48.281 --> 15:49.949
‐which you do.
‐Totally.

15:49.949 --> 15:51.617
Totally, yep, good.

15:51.617 --> 15:53.411
Right, well,
that's it, then.

15:53.411 --> 15:55.746
We have
an understanding. Brilliant.

15:55.746 --> 15:56.914
Yep. Good.

15:56.914 --> 15:58.124
Good.

15:59.542 --> 16:02.128
Okay, well,
I'm at work,

16:02.128 --> 16:04.213
<i>‐so I should‐‐</i>
‐Oh, yeah. Of course. Yes, go.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.506
Okay. Bye, Craig.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.175
Yeah. Bye.
Bye‐bye, Craig.

16:07.175 --> 16:08.259
What?

16:08.259 --> 16:10.052
(groans)

16:13.681 --> 16:15.308
Hey.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.852
Just, before you launch into
another diatribe about
how evil I am,

16:17.852 --> 16:20.104
will you just hear me out
for 15 seconds?

16:20.104 --> 16:24.400
I'm here
because I care about you.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.152
Ambushed is an interesting
way of showing it‐‐

16:26.152 --> 16:27.445
Just 15 seconds.

16:27.445 --> 16:28.613
That's all I need.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.659
I get this
more than you realize.

16:35.036 --> 16:38.831
This. The program. Rehab.

16:38.831 --> 16:39.999
All of it.

16:42.251 --> 16:45.713
My...

16:45.713 --> 16:50.301
Uncle Jonah used
to be a drug addict.

16:50.301 --> 16:53.471
So, I know how scary

16:53.471 --> 16:56.057
and hard this can all be.

16:56.057 --> 17:00.937
And I also know how...

17:00.937 --> 17:04.482
amazing it can be
to get sober.

17:06.150 --> 17:08.277
I watched him
go through all that.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.613
A few times, actually.

17:10.613 --> 17:16.077
I visited him in a few
rehabs, like four or five.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.246
I weirdly kind of
liked it as a kid.

17:18.246 --> 17:19.538
I don't know why.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.126
He never slammed
the door in my face.

17:33.177 --> 17:35.096
What do you think?

17:37.557 --> 17:39.141
Excuse me.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.768
Didn't mean to interrupt.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.772
What do you got there?

18:02.331 --> 18:03.833
You got a deal.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.716
I said we weren't
really friends.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.384
I didn't mean‐‐

18:13.384 --> 18:15.344
That's okay. I get it.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.389
There's just... weirdness.

18:20.391 --> 18:23.519
We were always adjacent.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.438
Not close.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.607
I'm not trying to steal Zack.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.317
I'm sorry.

18:33.154 --> 18:36.616
You've gotta understand
that Zack and I were, like,

18:36.616 --> 18:39.410
super close in middle school.

18:39.410 --> 18:41.412
And...

18:41.412 --> 18:46.334
Nyla was, like, the sole reason
I wasn't considered
a complete nerd.

18:46.334 --> 18:50.129
We were a thing,
the three of us,

18:50.129 --> 18:52.256
and then you come to PB,

18:52.256 --> 18:54.342
and you were already
friends with Rebecca,

18:54.342 --> 18:58.179
who was older and all,
and that should have
been enough.

18:58.179 --> 19:00.306
I don't know.

19:00.306 --> 19:03.809
Sorry. That was... real.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.272
I've always been jealous
of you and Zack.

19:10.858 --> 19:13.110
You guys have a friendship.

19:13.110 --> 19:14.445
Mmm.

19:14.445 --> 19:15.946
You guys have
interests in common.

19:15.946 --> 19:17.490
‐So do you, though.
‐Like what?

19:17.490 --> 19:18.908
Partying?

19:22.078 --> 19:25.331
I didn't mean
to mess things up for you.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.583
I know you didn't.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.254
I'm just...

19:32.254 --> 19:35.341
I'm still
processing everything.

19:35.341 --> 19:37.301
That's why I haven't
told you guys.

19:38.928 --> 19:41.305
I haven't wrapped my head
around what the hell this is.

19:41.305 --> 19:42.932
It's overwhelming.

19:42.932 --> 19:45.643
And if I do make sense of it,

19:45.643 --> 19:48.104
it's so big

19:48.104 --> 19:51.399
and so random
to explain.

19:51.399 --> 19:53.984
It's big.
Yeah, it's big.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.738
I don't really know
if it's random.

19:57.738 --> 19:59.990
It will be to Zack.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.368
Me not drinking?
That's our MO.

20:05.162 --> 20:08.165
I have no clue
how I'm gonna spin it.

20:08.165 --> 20:10.084
Or when.

20:10.084 --> 20:13.045
Or what I'd even be telling
him if I do.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.339
When I do.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.677
Ellie...

20:23.305 --> 20:26.183
I need time.

20:26.183 --> 20:27.601
Right now.

20:28.602 --> 20:30.688
He cannot know.

20:30.688 --> 20:32.773
For now.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.150
No one can.

20:35.317 --> 20:36.694
Okay?

20:36.694 --> 20:38.446
Okay. Okay.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.407
Okay.

20:41.407 --> 20:42.867
You know...

20:42.867 --> 20:44.410
You could have...

20:44.410 --> 20:46.746
You could have told
us about this.

20:46.746 --> 20:48.622
We would have
been there for you.

20:51.459 --> 20:53.043
Like you were
there for Rebecca?

21:00.009 --> 21:01.635
It makes sense,
the way my mom was

21:01.635 --> 21:03.345
when she was drinking,

21:03.345 --> 21:06.307
and when she wasn't drinking,

21:06.307 --> 21:09.810
that I'd be drawn to chaos

21:09.810 --> 21:11.353
and chaotic women.

21:11.353 --> 21:12.688
Shocking, right?

21:15.232 --> 21:19.528
You know, a lot of us in this
room are comforted by drama.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.656
You know what,
I'm comforted by drama.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.992
Highs and lows.

21:24.992 --> 21:28.162
Terrifying and messy
and exciting stuff.

21:28.162 --> 21:29.747
It's all a big snarl,

21:29.747 --> 21:32.541
like a tumbleweed.

21:32.541 --> 21:36.754
For me, life is
like a tumbleweed
of love and danger

21:36.754 --> 21:39.924
and fear and happiness.

21:39.924 --> 21:43.552
And what I want
is to untangle the tumbleweed

21:43.552 --> 21:46.347
so I get all the good chaos

21:46.347 --> 21:49.099
and protect myself
from the bad.

21:50.935 --> 21:53.354
I'm really grateful
for this program.

21:53.354 --> 21:55.439
Thanks for letting me share.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.537
Newcomer?

22:09.537 --> 22:11.413
You can tell?

22:11.413 --> 22:13.958
Only because of your
shimmeringly hopeful impulse
to drink that coffee black.

22:13.958 --> 22:15.167
It's bad.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.169
It's biblically bad.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.046
Let me doctor
it up for you.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.175
I'm Alan.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.511
(singsongy):
Hi, Alan.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.513
Was that a little
program humor?

22:27.513 --> 22:28.597
You're funny.

22:28.597 --> 22:29.890
I don't know what that was.

22:29.890 --> 22:31.559
I'm really not funny at all.

22:31.559 --> 22:32.810
I'm Charlotte.

22:32.810 --> 22:34.895
And I think I'm
just a little nervous.

22:34.895 --> 22:37.690
It's my... first meeting.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.402
Here you go.

22:41.402 --> 22:43.529
Lotta cream
and way too much sugar.

22:43.529 --> 22:45.447
It's the only way
it's fit for human consumption.

22:45.447 --> 22:46.490
Thank you.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.450
You know,
I was nervous at first, too.

22:48.450 --> 22:49.493
You were?

22:49.493 --> 22:50.661
Yeah, I was like,

22:50.661 --> 22:52.037
whoa, this is intense,

22:52.037 --> 22:53.664
overwhelming.

22:53.664 --> 22:57.126
And it seemed
a little cultish.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.460
(laughing)

22:58.460 --> 22:59.795
But you know,
at the end of the day,

22:59.795 --> 23:01.797
it's a really
wonderful program.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.758
And showing up here
is the best gift you can
give yourself.

23:04.758 --> 23:06.594
I know that sounds
a little corny,

23:06.594 --> 23:08.929
but I promise,
I'm not trying to have you
drink the Kool‐aid.

23:08.929 --> 23:10.598
No, just the coffee.

23:10.598 --> 23:13.684
See, you are funny.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.688
Tastes like a milkshake.

23:17.688 --> 23:19.523
Come for the milkshake,

23:19.523 --> 23:22.026
stay for the life‐changing
conversation.

23:22.026 --> 23:23.694
I mean, not with me,
you know,

23:23.694 --> 23:25.821
with them, you know,
the program, the group.

23:27.656 --> 23:29.158
Hey, Wes.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.161
Nice to meet you,
Charlotte.

23:38.626 --> 23:40.502
‐I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.
‐No.

23:40.502 --> 23:42.963
I'm sorry.

23:42.963 --> 23:46.425
And if it's okay with you,

23:46.425 --> 23:48.552
I'll see you on Wednesday?

23:51.096 --> 23:52.556
Yeah. Okay.

23:52.556 --> 23:55.851
Wait, Wes...

23:57.519 --> 23:59.772
Thank you.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.571
Vern:
Carrot cake at
a wedding is perverse.

24:07.571 --> 24:10.532
Nobody deserves raisins
at a wedding, not even
your dumb in‐laws.

24:10.532 --> 24:12.493
Fondant? Please.

24:12.493 --> 24:14.662
If I'm gonna put on a suit
and dance the Electric Slide
with your creepy cousins,

24:14.662 --> 24:16.121
then I want buttercream.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.247
Mm‐hmm.
Try this one.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.499
It's the holy grail.

24:20.834 --> 24:23.587
Gold‐leafed Tahitian vanilla
bean with hazelnut frosting.

24:23.587 --> 24:25.130
I think I'm seeing God.

24:25.130 --> 24:26.382
I know.

24:26.382 --> 24:28.175
But don't get
too attached.

24:28.175 --> 24:31.387
Two tiers of this dream cake
are literally more expensive
than the venue.

24:31.387 --> 24:33.138
‐Paul already nixed it.
‐Aww.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.640
You know what,
have that one.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.267
I kissed someone.

24:37.267 --> 24:38.769
What?

24:38.769 --> 24:40.562
Someone who is not Paul.

24:40.562 --> 24:44.066
Holy gold‐leafed
Tahitian vanilla bean,

24:44.066 --> 24:45.693
what the hell
are you talking about?

24:45.693 --> 24:47.111
Argh! I know, we just‐‐
we just kissed.

24:47.111 --> 24:48.779
Well, ugh.

24:48.779 --> 24:51.782
I can't believe I'm gonna say
this, but we made out.

24:51.782 --> 24:54.034
We made out like teenagers.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.829
And here's the thing, Vernie,

24:56.829 --> 24:58.163
it was so good.

24:58.163 --> 24:59.206
What?

24:59.206 --> 25:01.667
I mean, I feel ridiculous,
but kissing this guy‐‐

25:01.667 --> 25:04.461
Kissing this guy was literally
the sexiest thing that's
ever happened to me.

25:04.461 --> 25:05.713
‐Oh, my God.
‐I know!

25:05.713 --> 25:08.674
I know, I'm a horrible person.

25:08.674 --> 25:10.551
But it was like this rush,

25:10.551 --> 25:12.761
like a crazy ride,
it was so extreme.

25:12.761 --> 25:16.140
I felt like I was outside
my body and yet so deeply
inside at the same time.

25:16.140 --> 25:17.683
And it was a high.

25:17.683 --> 25:19.560
And it scared me.

25:19.560 --> 25:20.769
(sighs)

25:20.769 --> 25:21.812
And there you go.

25:21.812 --> 25:23.897
I am a doubly terrible person.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.649
Okay, you're not
a terrible person.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.651
But hold up,
who is this guy?

25:29.319 --> 25:31.363
It doesn't‐‐
It doesn't matter.

25:31.363 --> 25:32.781
It's never gonna
happen again.

25:32.781 --> 25:34.366
It was a stupid mistake.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.785
A last wild oat.

25:36.785 --> 25:39.038
I had one wild oat left,
just one,

25:39.038 --> 25:40.330
and that thing
has been sown.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.331
Oh.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.487
Uncle Jonah!

26:12.696 --> 26:14.573
Uncle Jonah?

26:21.538 --> 26:22.748
Oh, my God.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.166
Grandpa!

26:26.168 --> 26:27.669
(crying)

26:31.924 --> 26:33.050
It's okay, Ellie.

26:37.221 --> 26:40.432
Coroner should be
finished up in about 30 minutes.

26:40.432 --> 26:44.019
‐This was on him.
‐Sir, here you go.

27:04.706 --> 27:05.707
(sighs)

27:05.707 --> 27:07.459
Ellie:
<i>Dear Uncle Jonah,</i>

27:07.459 --> 27:08.919
<i>I love you...</i>

27:08.919 --> 27:11.588
Middle School Ellie:
<i>...but if you ever do</i>
<i>drugs again...</i>

27:11.588 --> 27:13.674
Younger Ellie:
<i>...you won't be</i>
<i>allowed in my room.</i>

27:13.674 --> 27:16.677
<i>Sincerely, Ellie.</i>

27:29.773 --> 27:31.400
Hi.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.402
Um, I need
to tell you something.

27:33.402 --> 27:36.613
But you have to promise
not to tell anyone.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.871
I cannot believe it.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.372
Yeah, I know.

27:45.372 --> 27:48.834
And yet, I can
kind of believe it.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.419
She didn't tell me.

27:50.419 --> 27:52.713
She didn't tell anybody.

27:52.713 --> 27:54.131
She didn't even tell Zack.

27:54.131 --> 27:56.884
I didn't know
she had a problem.

27:59.219 --> 28:03.891
We need to be
there for her. Okay?

28:03.891 --> 28:08.437
I mean, she didn't tell
anybody because she didn't
think we'd be supportive.

28:08.437 --> 28:10.731
We have to have her back.

28:11.815 --> 28:12.816
Mm‐hmm.

28:14.026 --> 28:15.319
Okay.

28:17.070 --> 28:18.614
We can't tell anyone.

28:18.614 --> 28:20.616
This has to stay
between you and me.

28:20.616 --> 28:21.867
Okay? Nobody else can know.

28:23.410 --> 28:24.786
I won't say a word.

28:24.786 --> 28:26.496
Thanks.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.005
‐Hey.
‐Hey.

28:37.341 --> 28:39.217
‐Cereal?
‐Sure.

28:43.013 --> 28:45.140
‐How have you been?
‐Fine.

28:48.810 --> 28:50.103
Work was good?

28:50.103 --> 28:51.939
With my mom?

28:51.939 --> 28:53.357
Really good.

28:54.608 --> 28:57.861
Work... with your mom...
was good.

29:04.201 --> 29:05.744
And you?

29:05.744 --> 29:07.287
You know.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.289
Hanging in there.

29:12.834 --> 29:14.878
Thank you.

29:14.878 --> 29:16.380
Do you think we're, uh,

29:16.380 --> 29:19.633
ready to start using
complete sentences?

29:19.633 --> 29:21.259
Yeah.

29:21.259 --> 29:24.930
And I really
wanted to talk to you.

29:24.930 --> 29:27.432
And last night I came
looking for you,

29:27.432 --> 29:29.267
but it was late,

29:29.267 --> 29:31.103
‐and I‐‐
‐Craig: Wes, toolkit!

29:31.103 --> 29:32.229
What?

29:32.229 --> 29:33.313
Grab your toolkit.

29:33.313 --> 29:34.940
Vern and I are fixing
the girls' vanity.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.441
We need your wrench.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.861
What are these girls
doing in here?

29:39.861 --> 29:41.530
How did they even
break that thing?

29:41.530 --> 29:43.115
Oh, I don't know,
it's always something.

29:43.115 --> 29:44.491
Especially with the girls.

29:44.491 --> 29:47.035
If it's not the sink,
it's hair everywhere.

29:47.035 --> 29:48.495
I mean, there is
hair everywhere in here.

29:48.495 --> 29:51.039
Dude, dude, you're screwing
that the wrong way.

29:51.039 --> 29:52.416
‐Oh.
‐You go clockwise.

29:52.416 --> 29:53.417
(clanging)

29:53.417 --> 29:54.960
Man, you deserve
a night off.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.795
You know what we need?

29:56.795 --> 29:58.171
Guys' night out!

29:58.171 --> 29:59.214
Yeah!

29:59.214 --> 30:00.924
Vern, mate,
it's barely the afternoon.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.884
Okay, well,
guys' lunch out.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.302
No. No.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.929
‐Absolutely not.
‐Come on, Craig.

30:05.929 --> 30:07.931
Be the man
that you want to be.

30:07.931 --> 30:10.976
Stop being the "no" man,
and be the "yes" man.

30:14.896 --> 30:17.649
All right, guys,
sodas for you two.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.109
‐Thank you.
‐Thanks.

30:19.109 --> 30:20.861
And I got
a Shirley Temple for you.

30:20.861 --> 30:22.320
‐Seriously?
‐What?

30:22.320 --> 30:25.365
And I have a round
of our specialty shots,

30:25.365 --> 30:27.743
compliments of the ladies
over at table 18.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.703
Really, that is so sweet!

30:29.703 --> 30:30.871
‐Hey!
‐Thank you.

30:30.871 --> 30:31.997
No. No. No, no thanks.
No shots.

30:31.997 --> 30:33.999
‐Just have one.
‐It's fine. Thank you.

30:33.999 --> 30:36.001
Look, you know,
they do look rather tasty.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.878
‐I've never had one before.
‐Melon shot?

30:37.878 --> 30:38.879
A shot.

30:38.879 --> 30:41.381
Okay, well,
go ahead, man.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.091
Life experience time.

30:43.091 --> 30:44.301
Live a little!

30:44.301 --> 30:45.343
(chuckling)

30:45.343 --> 30:47.054
Fine. Fine.

30:47.054 --> 30:48.346
But just this one. Cheers.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.973
‐Cheers!
‐Cheers!

30:49.973 --> 30:52.726
I'm really happy
you've kept up with
your journaling, Maddie.

30:55.896 --> 30:59.107
Anything else on your mind?

31:04.071 --> 31:06.281
Have you ever been in
a relationship with someone
you shouldn't be?

31:08.575 --> 31:10.952
Interesting. Um...

31:10.952 --> 31:14.081
Are we talking about
a romantic relationship here?

31:14.081 --> 31:16.124
Yes. Talking about
a romantic relationship

31:16.124 --> 31:18.335
that's not right,

31:18.335 --> 31:20.962
but not wrong either.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.756
Well, the‐‐ Uh...

31:22.756 --> 31:24.758
Sometimes relationships
can be...

31:24.758 --> 31:27.010
um, complicated. And...

31:27.010 --> 31:29.679
just because a relationship
isn't right,

31:29.679 --> 31:31.932
uh, you might think
that it makes you
a bad person,

31:31.932 --> 31:34.559
and, uh,
maybe it does. Maybe.

31:34.559 --> 31:37.145
And maybe, if it isn't
right, then it's wrong.

31:37.145 --> 31:39.731
Very wrong,
and very irresponsible.

31:39.731 --> 31:43.568
But then again,
maybe relationship
is too strong of a word?

31:43.568 --> 31:47.114
And, but if it feels so right,
then is it so wrong?

31:47.114 --> 31:48.448
Right?

31:48.448 --> 31:50.534
What the hell
are you talking about?

31:50.534 --> 31:52.369
What are you talking about?

31:52.369 --> 31:54.412
I'm talking about Zack.
I just didn't want to say it
because you know him.

31:54.412 --> 31:56.331
Oh. Oh, Maddie, that‐‐

31:56.331 --> 31:59.084
No, no, no.
You can‐‐

31:59.084 --> 32:01.294
You can say whatever
you want to say in here,
no judgment.

32:03.130 --> 32:05.048
Craig: Do you think
you can stop yourself
from falling in love?

32:05.048 --> 32:08.176
That is a very
philosophical question
for this time of day.

32:08.176 --> 32:11.179
Let me rephrase. Okay.

32:11.179 --> 32:14.474
So, let's say there's this‐‐
this girl.

32:14.474 --> 32:18.728
Um, this fantastic girl.

32:18.728 --> 32:22.023
But, you know,
she's got this‐‐
There's an obstacle.

32:22.023 --> 32:23.692
What kind of obstacle?

32:23.692 --> 32:27.112
Um, a big, big, big,
inconvenient obstacle.
It doesn't matter.

32:27.112 --> 32:30.198
But it makes it
near impossible
for it to work out.

32:30.198 --> 32:33.076
What would you do?
Would you go for it?

32:33.076 --> 32:35.620
Or do you... Grr.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.250
Yeah. I think I'd go for it.

32:43.044 --> 32:45.922
I didn't have time
to experiment,

32:45.922 --> 32:48.842
or wander, or really
find myself in my youth.

32:48.842 --> 32:51.720
I just sort of surged
into adulthood fully formed

32:51.720 --> 32:53.138
and serious.

32:53.138 --> 32:55.223
How do you
find yourself, Richard?

32:55.223 --> 32:58.643
I didn't realize
he'd have the tolerance
of an 85‐pound ballerina.

32:58.643 --> 33:02.189
Do you think we should
take him home?

33:03.064 --> 33:05.817
Nah. Leave him alone.
He's having fun.

33:05.817 --> 33:08.945
The mind boggles, Richard!
It really does!

33:08.945 --> 33:10.697
(funk music playing)

33:10.697 --> 33:12.616
Yes. Right.

33:12.616 --> 33:15.785
You two, dance off
is what is happening.

33:15.785 --> 33:17.746
Right now. Dance off.

33:17.746 --> 33:20.707
Wes, I expected you
to just sit there

33:20.707 --> 33:22.167
looking like
a statue of James Dean.

33:22.167 --> 33:24.252
But Vern, my friend,

33:24.252 --> 33:27.756
get your ass on
the dance floor right now.

33:27.756 --> 33:29.132
Come on. Dance off.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.258
‐Get your ass
on the dance floor, Vern.

I know what's
going on with Maddie.

34:21.935 --> 34:24.145
She's cheating on me.

34:24.145 --> 34:26.356
I'm so stupid
I didn't see it before.

34:28.358 --> 34:29.943
She gets weird calls.

34:29.943 --> 34:32.821
She bailed on
my birthday party.

34:32.821 --> 34:35.156
Maddie, who never
leaves a party early.

34:37.200 --> 34:38.868
She ran away from me
in the hall today.

34:38.868 --> 34:40.704
‐Why would she‐‐
‐That's not true.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.500
Okay, she's... not.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.129
I can see it on your face,
you're lying.

34:49.129 --> 34:50.547
Who's the guy?

34:50.547 --> 34:52.215
That's not
what's going on.

34:53.341 --> 34:54.676
It's something else.

34:57.345 --> 34:58.096
(sighs)

35:00.390 --> 35:02.017
(phone ringing)

35:02.017 --> 35:03.226
‐Hello?
‐Craig: <i>Yeah, Cynthia,</i>
<i>don't say anything.</i>

35:03.226 --> 35:05.645
I'm just gonna
say what I need to say

35:05.645 --> 35:07.230
because it's driving me crazy.

35:07.230 --> 35:10.191
<i>Look, I'll just say it,</i>
<i>and then you'll have it.</i>

35:10.191 --> 35:11.234
<i>Um...</i>

35:13.028 --> 35:16.406
Cynthia, I don't want
what happened to be
the last and only time.

35:16.406 --> 35:17.824
I don't.

35:17.824 --> 35:21.286
I would like tens
or hundreds more occurrences

35:21.286 --> 35:22.537
<i>like that.</i>

35:22.537 --> 35:23.913
<i>Because, respectfully Cynthia,</i>

35:23.913 --> 35:27.667
the thing is, you are...

35:27.667 --> 35:29.544
you're incredible.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.171
<i>You are.</i>

35:31.171 --> 35:33.340
I mean, I think
you're fascinating,

35:33.340 --> 35:36.468
and complex,
and so damn sexy.

35:36.468 --> 35:40.013
<i>And I don't</i>
<i>understand you yet,</i>

35:40.013 --> 35:43.058
and I want to.

35:43.058 --> 35:45.435
<i>I want to understand you.</i>

35:45.435 --> 35:49.230
I just‐‐ I just hoped
somehow you'll let me.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.025
(sighs)

35:56.363 --> 35:57.530
You came back.

35:59.282 --> 36:01.326
Gonna give this a try.

36:01.326 --> 36:04.204
But I draw a line
at the coffee.

36:05.497 --> 36:07.332
I thought you might
like one too.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.293
Thanks.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.514
Hi.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.265
Hi.

36:24.265 --> 36:25.183
Are you okay?

36:30.939 --> 36:31.940
You okay?

36:33.316 --> 36:34.567
Yeah.

36:34.567 --> 36:37.487
I don't know.
Kind of just... surviving.

36:37.487 --> 36:40.198
I'm here for you
if you need me.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.533
To talk about it.

36:41.533 --> 36:43.993
To not talk about it.

36:43.993 --> 36:45.370
Thanks.

36:45.370 --> 36:47.163
Maybe not talk about it.

36:47.163 --> 36:49.207
I can do that.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.375
Hey, guys.

36:50.375 --> 36:52.210
Hey.

36:52.210 --> 36:55.422
Cool, so how's our
fantasy baseball team looking?

36:55.422 --> 36:56.339
You'll love this.

36:56.339 --> 36:57.882
That rookie pitcher
you didn't want?

36:57.882 --> 36:59.342
He's a machine.

36:59.342 --> 37:00.969
He struck out Ortiz twice.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.097
He was Uncle Jonah's pick.

37:09.477 --> 37:11.146
I'll see you guys.

37:17.402 --> 37:19.195
Hey, I love <i>The Giver.</i>

37:19.195 --> 37:20.405
It's okay, I guess.

37:20.405 --> 37:21.489
It's brilliant.

37:21.489 --> 37:23.074
I don't know.
Maybe it's not for me.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.409
Maybe you just don't get it.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.827
Would you like
to explain it to me?

37:25.827 --> 37:28.455
I could.
That and baseball.

37:28.455 --> 37:30.039
Three bases,
a bunch of morons.

37:30.039 --> 37:31.666
Sounds like
complicated stuff for you.

37:31.666 --> 37:34.461
Guess I should
be taking notes.

37:34.461 --> 37:35.670
(laughing)

37:39.048 --> 37:40.091
Ellie told you.

37:40.091 --> 37:41.301
‐No, she didn't.
‐I'm not an idiot.

37:41.301 --> 37:42.302
It was Nyla.

37:44.220 --> 37:45.513
They're worried about you.

37:45.513 --> 37:47.515
They're on your side.
I am too.

37:47.515 --> 37:49.768
Or I would have been
if I'd known.

37:49.768 --> 37:52.645
God, you lied to me
about so many things
so easily.

37:55.148 --> 37:56.566
I'm really sorry.

38:00.487 --> 38:01.738
This is a lot.

38:03.573 --> 38:07.368
A sober house,
rehab, whatever.

38:07.368 --> 38:10.121
But you can always
be honest with me.

38:12.582 --> 38:14.751
Always, I'm here for you.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.470
I will be.

38:25.470 --> 38:28.681
Right, from now on,
only the truth.

38:32.477 --> 38:35.104
Can I come inside?
Meet your friends?

38:35.104 --> 38:36.523
No.

38:38.483 --> 38:40.485
You're so sweet.

38:40.485 --> 38:43.446
Uh, but...

38:43.446 --> 38:48.159
We're not allowed
non‐residents past 5:00 p. m.

38:48.159 --> 38:51.538
I's a whole thing.

38:51.538 --> 38:53.540
You know, protocol.

38:53.540 --> 38:55.208
Craig:
Your brain...

38:55.208 --> 38:58.461
can cast other people
to play people you know.

38:58.461 --> 39:00.338
You ever had that?

39:00.338 --> 39:04.300
Listen, like, hey, in one dream,
it was my high school
cross country coach.

39:04.300 --> 39:06.219
I'm sure. I mean,
I knew it was him,

39:06.219 --> 39:09.430
Mr. Largman with
the swish‐swish jogging boxers.

39:09.430 --> 39:12.016
Oh. Hey!

39:12.016 --> 39:14.143
‐Hey, Maddie.
‐What the‐‐

39:14.143 --> 39:15.436
(laughing)

39:15.436 --> 39:18.356
Oh, hi.

39:18.356 --> 39:19.983
Is this your boyfriend?

39:19.983 --> 39:22.735
Oh, he is
very handsome, Maddie.

39:22.735 --> 39:23.945
He is, isn't he?

39:23.945 --> 39:25.488
Very handsome, you are.

39:25.488 --> 39:29.534
And it's nice
to finally meet you. I'm Craig.

39:29.534 --> 39:31.452
And I'm a little drunk.

39:31.452 --> 39:32.954
But don't worry,

39:32.954 --> 39:34.622
I'm the counselor here.

39:34.622 --> 39:37.417
Okay, why don't
we all come inside?

39:37.417 --> 39:38.835
Just come inside.
There's plenty of cake left.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.420
Yes, inside, come inside.

39:40.420 --> 39:42.463
‐You must come inside.
‐And many glasses of water.

39:49.095 --> 39:51.347
Craig:
You know, ostriches
are basically dinosaurs?

39:51.347 --> 39:53.641
They are! Dinosaurs!

say it like a normal‐‐

I don't want you

Down the hatch.

Maddie:
