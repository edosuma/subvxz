WEBVTT

00:38.885 --> 00:40.285
Mildred Hubble.

00:40.365 --> 00:41.925
You almost missed lantern duty.

00:42.005 --> 00:42.805
Again.

00:43.285 --> 00:46.885
I have a clock with no hands
which tells time better than you do.

00:47.845 --> 00:50.765
{\an8}It is an important job. Do it properly.

00:53.605 --> 00:54.965
You have to take this seriously, Mil.

00:55.405 --> 00:56.925
What is occurring?

00:57.245 --> 00:59.885
{\an8}Do not expect this back.

00:59.965 --> 01:01.205
{\an8}Sorry, Miss Hardbroom.

01:01.285 --> 01:02.605
And that goes for anyone else

01:02.685 --> 01:04.444
{\an8}I catch playing this...

01:04.525 --> 01:06.405
{\an8}ghastly game.

01:10.765 --> 01:11.925
Bad luck.

01:15.005 --> 01:17.125
Hey! What a day, huh?

01:17.605 --> 01:19.725
Why? It's just a day like any other.

01:20.805 --> 01:21.805
Really?

01:21.885 --> 01:25.125
Nothing special planned?
No parties I should know about?

01:25.565 --> 01:28.165
Not that I know of
but if you hear about any, let us know.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.325
Oh, come sit with us, Ms Hubble.

01:46.845 --> 01:49.285
Oh, what I wouldn't give for a muffin.

01:49.365 --> 01:52.045
Muffins are buns
with delusions of grandeur.

01:52.125 --> 01:53.565
And they're banned.

01:57.405 --> 01:59.965
What a futile waste of time.

02:00.045 --> 02:03.645
Come now, it encourages hand-eye
coordination, mental dexterity--

02:03.725 --> 02:05.365
And rampant insubordination.

02:06.005 --> 02:07.605
This term's fad, that's all.

02:07.685 --> 02:11.125
When I was a girl it was Finglebugs
or Spinning Clacker Hoops.

02:12.685 --> 02:14.845
Ignore it and it'll pass, as they all do.

02:16.085 --> 02:18.365
I trust the try-outs
for the broomstick hurling squad

02:18.445 --> 02:19.565
are set for later, Miss Drill?

02:20.485 --> 02:23.445
I feel it in my stockings,
this is the year.

02:23.525 --> 02:24.645
Broomstick hurling?

02:24.725 --> 02:26.685
That sounds like fun, I might have a go.

02:27.165 --> 02:29.085
It is only open to students...

02:29.645 --> 02:30.685
who are magic.

02:36.005 --> 02:37.765
Is that the game Ethel and Felicity
were playing?

02:38.605 --> 02:39.645
How does it work?

02:40.445 --> 02:42.485
Symbols drop,
you move them with your finger.

02:42.885 --> 02:45.285
You get three or more together...

02:46.245 --> 02:47.845
like that, and then...

02:50.085 --> 02:51.485
It's called <i> Witchy Smash</i>.

02:51.565 --> 02:52.725
Can I have a go, please?

03:00.085 --> 03:01.765
There. There.

03:02.845 --> 03:03.725
Quickly!

03:10.165 --> 03:11.285
You got to level two!

03:16.245 --> 03:17.565
Keep calm, Mil. Keep calm.

03:17.645 --> 03:19.165
I am calm, Maud!

03:29.685 --> 03:30.925
Unlucky.

03:31.005 --> 03:32.485
Great. I'm rubbish at it.

03:33.365 --> 03:35.045
Well, it was your first go.

03:40.365 --> 03:41.405
Who's the new girl?

03:43.125 --> 03:45.685
-Hm.
-Actually, I've been here for two years.

03:53.085 --> 03:54.605
Oh, I've won! I've won!

04:09.725 --> 04:11.125
Woah, look at that.

04:15.805 --> 04:16.805
It's lovely, Enid.

04:17.445 --> 04:18.285
Well done.

04:21.765 --> 04:24.084
Who on earth is "Lord Gamer"?

04:24.844 --> 04:26.524
Ethel's doing well.

04:43.085 --> 04:45.325
Get out! Now!

04:56.045 --> 04:57.045
What is it?

04:57.245 --> 04:58.285
What's wrong, Sybil?

05:00.045 --> 05:02.325
Just my worst birthday ever.

05:04.645 --> 05:06.245
Happy birthday!

05:06.325 --> 05:08.605
See, I knew you'd forgotten.

05:08.925 --> 05:10.445
Just like Mum, Dad

05:11.125 --> 05:12.245
and Ethel.

05:12.325 --> 05:14.525
She was too busy playing that stupid game.

05:15.925 --> 05:17.925
Well, now we know.

05:18.045 --> 05:20.645
-So...
-I actually hoped you were just pretending

05:20.725 --> 05:21.565
to have forgotten,

05:22.125 --> 05:24.285
so you could throw me a surprise party.

05:24.365 --> 05:26.405
But, you know I hate surprises.

05:26.965 --> 05:32.165
So, I cast a foresight spell,
to see what the day would bring.

05:32.245 --> 05:34.045
Sybil! Those are super dangerous.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.805
Fate should not be messed with.

05:35.885 --> 05:36.845
I know that now.

05:37.485 --> 05:39.525
I saw witches running, screaming.

05:40.285 --> 05:41.365
HB, furious.

05:42.285 --> 05:43.125
And I saw me.

05:44.325 --> 05:45.325
I was crying.

05:48.445 --> 05:50.365
I don't want all that to come true.

05:50.765 --> 05:53.525
Don't worry. We'll help you figure it out.

05:56.965 --> 05:58.885
Miss Cackle says she's going to keep
Midnight's kittens

05:58.965 --> 06:00.885
to be familiars
for next term's new first years.

06:00.965 --> 06:02.365
Hey! Give me that back, it's mine!

06:04.405 --> 06:07.245
Isn't it hilarious everyone getting
so bent out of shape over a game?

06:07.325 --> 06:08.245
Uh-huh.

06:10.685 --> 06:12.525
I thought Miss Tapioca
banned muffins.

06:13.525 --> 06:15.805
What can I say? My mum has her ways.

06:22.045 --> 06:23.885
Miss Tapioca has her ways too.

06:29.485 --> 06:30.325
So weird.

06:33.525 --> 06:34.405
Interesting book.

06:35.405 --> 06:37.205
Apparently he's been reading it for ages.

06:37.285 --> 06:39.045
He hasn't even realized anyone's here.

06:40.085 --> 06:41.805
Yes!

06:42.165 --> 06:44.365
I thought HB
confiscated Felicity's maglet.

06:44.645 --> 06:47.125
Her parents got her a new one
by broomstick courier.

06:47.205 --> 06:50.445
Hey! You knocked me into third, cheater.

06:50.525 --> 06:52.245
Says Cackles' biggest cheater.

07:03.605 --> 07:06.685
Hand it over
if you want us to stay friends.

07:07.925 --> 07:09.325
I guess we're not friends.

07:10.085 --> 07:11.765
Girls, wanna work together?

07:12.285 --> 07:14.445
We'll pool all the prizes that we win
and share them out equally.

07:14.525 --> 07:15.365
Yeah.

07:15.445 --> 07:17.125
So that's how you want to do this?

07:18.485 --> 07:19.565
Girls.

07:27.125 --> 07:30.285
Ethel totally looks like
she wants to vanish Felicity.

07:31.845 --> 07:32.965
Yes!

07:33.045 --> 07:36.045
Lord Gamer for the win! Boom!

07:37.085 --> 07:37.965
Well...

07:38.045 --> 07:39.805
that solves that mystery.

07:39.885 --> 07:41.325
This just gets weirder.

07:46.645 --> 07:48.405
Grab your brushes and palettes,
girls,

07:48.485 --> 07:50.045
we'll be carrying on from last lesson.

07:51.245 --> 07:52.525
What's wrong with my magic?

07:53.005 --> 07:54.605
Mildred, have you seen Felicity?

07:55.325 --> 07:56.765
She was in Spell Science.

07:58.485 --> 08:03.285
Skipping class to play that stupid game
you're all addicted to, no doubt.

08:04.125 --> 08:06.285
Do you reckon
Ethel's nobbled her somehow?

08:26.605 --> 08:29.765
Oh. Miss Bat is going to love these.

08:35.565 --> 08:37.125
Mmm.

08:48.005 --> 08:49.645
Isn't that Felicity's?

08:49.725 --> 08:53.005
Yeah. That's her new maglet.
She's got a stack of those cases.

08:54.285 --> 08:56.045
Why would she just leave them here?

08:56.925 --> 09:00.085
Looks like powder, maybe soil?
Where did it come from?

09:00.845 --> 09:02.765
I think it's time we talked to Ethel.

09:08.325 --> 09:12.125
Remember, potion bottles are worth more
than broomsticks,

09:12.205 --> 09:15.045
and whatever you do, ignore cauldrons!

09:15.125 --> 09:16.925
Have you seen Felicity, Ethel?

09:17.005 --> 09:18.965
Off somewhere practicing, I'm sure.

09:19.045 --> 09:21.165
No, she's not. We found this.

09:22.285 --> 09:25.005
Don't make me laugh.
She probably has a drawer full of them.

09:26.205 --> 09:27.765
Did I say you can stop?

09:28.765 --> 09:32.605
First girl to win a gold prize box
can take a five-minute break.

09:32.685 --> 09:36.005
Ethel, you don't think maybe
you're all just a tiny bit addicted?

09:36.645 --> 09:38.205
I can stop anytime I like.

09:46.405 --> 09:47.325
But...

09:47.965 --> 09:49.325
I don't want to stop.

09:52.765 --> 09:54.605
-It's looking so good, Mum.
-Mm-hmm.

09:58.045 --> 09:59.365
Do you miss being magic?

10:00.525 --> 10:02.445
Well, it was fun, but...

10:02.525 --> 10:05.085
I'm glad to see the back of it
if I'm honest.

10:05.165 --> 10:06.445
Ms Hubble!

10:06.805 --> 10:08.525
Can you just knock you stupid...

10:08.845 --> 10:11.405
I am so sorry, I should have knocked.

10:11.485 --> 10:13.605
No, no, I'm sorry,
it was my fault.

10:13.685 --> 10:15.685
Butterfingers. What can I help you with?

10:15.765 --> 10:18.045
I wondered if you'd seen Mr Rowan-Webb?

10:18.125 --> 10:19.805
We had a lunch planned.

10:20.405 --> 10:24.165
I'm afraid to say the sandwiches arrived,
but he didn't.

10:24.245 --> 10:27.085
Well, perhaps he's got
a belly full of flies.

10:27.165 --> 10:28.845
Couldn't get enough of them,
last time I saw him.

10:29.285 --> 10:32.685
-Ho-ho.
-That's Lord "underscore" Gamer for you.

10:34.685 --> 10:36.285
Hey, all your prices have doubled!

10:36.845 --> 10:38.765
The introductory period is over.

10:39.645 --> 10:40.845
That's business.

10:41.885 --> 10:45.205
Maybe everyone will forget about the game
once the novelty wears off.

10:45.845 --> 10:47.445
I'm not so sure, Maud.

10:47.525 --> 10:48.885
It's the prizes that bother me.

10:49.205 --> 10:52.205
Nothing's ever for free, is it?
So, what's the catch?

10:55.605 --> 10:57.605
Very nice. Good control.

10:57.685 --> 10:59.805
Very impressive distance.

10:59.885 --> 11:01.645
Girls, let's try you all together,

11:01.725 --> 11:03.485
so we can compare techniques.

11:03.565 --> 11:06.045
How do we even know
the foresight spell worked?

11:11.765 --> 11:13.165
Are you okay, Sybil?

11:13.565 --> 11:14.925
Wait!

11:15.005 --> 11:16.045
I've seen this before!

11:16.885 --> 11:19.285
Girls, hit the deck!

11:20.405 --> 11:21.765
I have to stop this!

11:30.605 --> 11:31.845
Girls, hit the deck!

11:39.365 --> 11:42.885
We couldn't do it. We tried,
but we couldn't stop it coming true.

11:42.965 --> 11:45.525
It was like they weren't concentrating.
Maybe it was the game?

11:46.565 --> 11:48.845
Seems like that's all anyone's
been thinking about today.

11:49.885 --> 11:51.165
Are we really sure about this?

11:52.165 --> 11:54.165
You used a spell to see the future,

11:54.245 --> 11:56.325
so maybe there's one
to stop it coming true?

11:56.405 --> 11:57.925
All we need is the ingredients.

12:04.365 --> 12:05.565
Get out!

12:05.645 --> 12:06.885
Now!

12:09.725 --> 12:10.885
My second vision!

12:11.445 --> 12:13.085
You're right, it is that game.

12:13.605 --> 12:14.805
It's taking over everything.

12:14.885 --> 12:16.285
That's confirmed it then.

12:16.365 --> 12:19.765
I hate to say it, but maybe we should
just accept that we can't fight fate?

12:19.845 --> 12:21.245
What about number three?

12:21.325 --> 12:23.565
What if it's something terrible
making me cry?

12:24.125 --> 12:25.845
What if my birthday, which you,

12:25.925 --> 12:29.125
my family, in fact, everyone forgot,

12:29.205 --> 12:30.765
is going to end in a nightmare?

12:36.325 --> 12:37.805
Ethel, how are you feeling?

12:37.885 --> 12:39.445
Get your hand off me.

12:41.485 --> 12:43.805
I felt ill and drained,

12:43.885 --> 12:47.045
like my magic wasn't strong enough
to keep control of my broom.

12:49.365 --> 12:50.405
Magic!

12:50.485 --> 12:51.765
That's the catch. Magic!

12:51.845 --> 12:54.525
That's what everyone's giving up
in return for winning all the prizes!

12:54.605 --> 12:57.005
Ethel, stop! Stop playing, all of you!

12:57.605 --> 12:59.845
I think the game is stealing magic.

12:59.925 --> 13:01.645
Now you just sound desperate.

13:03.725 --> 13:05.085
Okay then, so what do we do?

13:05.165 --> 13:08.765
Well, if there is a link between the game
and everyone's magic becoming weaker,

13:08.845 --> 13:10.365
then we need more proof, right?

13:10.445 --> 13:11.605
Right.

13:11.685 --> 13:12.965
Let's start with what we know.

13:15.925 --> 13:16.885
What do we know?

13:18.085 --> 13:19.405
-It's a game.
-Right.

13:19.485 --> 13:20.885
-It uses symbols.
-Mm-hmm.

13:20.965 --> 13:23.685
Some of the symbols are very old,
I can hardly understand them.

13:23.765 --> 13:26.445
And where do you go when you need
to know about something old?

13:26.805 --> 13:27.725
Miss Bat!

13:27.805 --> 13:28.765
Race you there!

13:37.965 --> 13:39.925
Oh. We were looking for Miss Bat.

13:40.005 --> 13:42.445
She didn't show up. Very strange.

13:42.885 --> 13:44.885
Probably slept in
after her post-lunch nap.

13:44.965 --> 13:46.285
I'm standing in for her.

13:47.445 --> 13:48.725
Do you recognize these?

13:49.565 --> 13:50.885
We think they might be quite old.

13:50.965 --> 13:52.885
From distant Witchory or something.

13:52.965 --> 13:53.965
Any ideas?

13:55.285 --> 13:56.325
That would be...

13:56.405 --> 13:57.405
Um...

13:58.525 --> 14:00.245
Yes, so...

14:00.325 --> 14:04.005
Well, my specialty
is more recent Witchory...

14:04.765 --> 14:05.605
but...

14:05.685 --> 14:07.085
I guess, I...

14:07.165 --> 14:08.005
Yes?

14:09.805 --> 14:11.245
-B...
-It's Ivy.

14:11.925 --> 14:13.085
Yes. Ivy.

14:13.925 --> 14:15.325
The symbols are old.

14:15.885 --> 14:19.525
They're from a game that used rune stones,
called, um...

14:19.605 --> 14:21.005
"Witchy Match."

14:21.605 --> 14:23.045
Yes. Of course.

14:23.125 --> 14:26.805
You threw the stones down,
if five were matching then you won.

14:26.885 --> 14:28.045
It's all in here.

14:36.005 --> 14:38.165
Thanks. You've been really helpful.

14:38.685 --> 14:40.725
Very well done, Ivy.

14:41.565 --> 14:42.925
Nothing I didn't already know,

14:43.005 --> 14:44.445
but good.

14:45.965 --> 14:47.445
My...

14:48.365 --> 14:49.205
book.

14:49.725 --> 14:53.205
So, the maglet game is an updated version
of this old stone one?

14:53.285 --> 14:54.165
Looks like it.

14:54.925 --> 14:57.445
Although, someone had to be first
to play it here.

14:57.525 --> 15:00.885
So maybe if we could trace it back to that
person, we could solve the whole mystery.

15:02.005 --> 15:05.885
So, Margot got it from Nora,
who says she got it from Felicity and...

15:06.445 --> 15:08.685
Lucy got it from Harriet Henbane.

15:09.605 --> 15:11.645
I wonder if Enid managed to find Miss Bat?

15:14.845 --> 15:15.685
Found it!

15:17.285 --> 15:19.245
Oh, this isn't good.

15:20.445 --> 15:24.045
"It became such an obsession at one
school that the pupils cared about it

15:24.125 --> 15:26.525
more than their friends,
more than their magic,

15:26.605 --> 15:29.205
and in the end, more than their school."

15:30.325 --> 15:31.365
What happened to the school?

15:32.045 --> 15:33.805
It burned down.

15:34.325 --> 15:37.765
Everyone lived, but Witchy Match
was banished, never heard of again.

15:37.845 --> 15:39.405
That is until now.

15:40.325 --> 15:42.365
So the old game destroyed a school?

15:43.565 --> 15:46.005
Is that why whoever is behind all this
brought it back?

15:46.085 --> 15:47.165
To do that here?

15:51.085 --> 15:52.925
OK, so Hilda got it from Ethel.

15:53.805 --> 15:54.645
Winnie said she did too.

15:54.725 --> 15:56.565
In fact, a lot of girls got it from Ethel.

15:56.645 --> 15:58.285
So, Ethel was the first to play it?

15:59.245 --> 16:01.965
No wonder she was so cross
about Felicity being better than her.

16:02.045 --> 16:04.765
Let's go back and talk to her,
find out who gave her the game.

16:06.965 --> 16:08.205
But now she knows.

16:08.285 --> 16:10.885
So all she has to do is, like, not cry.
Right?

16:10.965 --> 16:11.845
It's not that simple.

16:11.925 --> 16:15.445
It's the fear of not knowing what's going
to make her cry that's upsetting her.

16:15.525 --> 16:16.525
I'm confused.

16:16.605 --> 16:19.045
And that's why it's such a bad idea
to mess with fate.

16:19.125 --> 16:20.805
All we can do is try to make it up to her

16:20.885 --> 16:23.245
for forgetting her birthday
in the first place.

16:23.325 --> 16:25.005
I wonder where Miss Tapioca is.

16:26.485 --> 16:28.885
- That's weird.
- Oh, oh, oh!

16:32.165 --> 16:33.165
Hello, girls.

16:33.845 --> 16:34.805
How can I help?

16:34.885 --> 16:36.445
It's Sybil's birthday, Ms Hubble.

16:36.525 --> 16:38.645
We were thinking of making her a cake.

16:38.725 --> 16:40.285
Have you seen Miss Tapioca?

16:40.365 --> 16:42.445
Oh, shame, you've just missed her.

16:42.525 --> 16:44.525
But, hey, good luck with the baking.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.725
Looking for Ethel? Join the club.

17:00.325 --> 17:02.085
I wanted to talk to her
about Sybil's birthday,

17:02.165 --> 17:04.525
but seems everyone's
been disappearing today.

17:04.605 --> 17:05.685
What do you mean?

17:05.765 --> 17:07.405
Beatrice and I were just in the kitchen

17:07.484 --> 17:09.484
and there's no sign
of Miss Tapioca either.

17:11.805 --> 17:15.885
So that's Ethel and Miss Tapioca missing,
along with Felicity.

17:16.645 --> 17:18.005
And Mr Rowan-Webb.

17:18.084 --> 17:20.324
And maybe Miss Bat. That makes five.

17:22.724 --> 17:24.885
Could it be the game
making them disappear?

17:25.565 --> 17:28.645
I mean, Mr Rowan-Webb was playing it,
but Miss Tapioca?

17:28.725 --> 17:29.765
Miss Bat?

17:30.765 --> 17:32.084
What else connects them?

17:32.165 --> 17:35.045
So what we're looking at here
is an evil plot that's stealing magic,

17:35.125 --> 17:37.565
making people vanish and might end up
destroying the school.

17:37.645 --> 17:38.805
How?

17:38.885 --> 17:41.485
We don't even know who's behind it,
they could be anywhere.

17:45.405 --> 17:47.325
This isn't happening in any other schools.

17:47.405 --> 17:49.605
All the names on the scoreboard
were from here.

17:50.045 --> 17:51.925
I think whoever's behind it is here too.

17:58.725 --> 18:01.365
These prize boxes
are coming from somewhere, right?

18:11.885 --> 18:13.285
Let's start by figuring out where.

18:18.125 --> 18:19.165
He's already a great tracker,

18:19.245 --> 18:22.245
so with a keen smell spell,
I'm hoping he'll lead us

18:22.325 --> 18:24.045
to where the prize boxes are being made.

18:24.125 --> 18:25.725
Maybe even the missing people too.

18:33.085 --> 18:34.645
Star.

18:36.165 --> 18:39.885
Drink this potion, hear my spell,
now increase your sense of smell.

18:43.725 --> 18:46.205
What about a Plan B?

18:54.165 --> 18:55.405
How about a Plan C?

19:00.165 --> 19:01.925
I can't believe you drank the potion.

19:02.005 --> 19:04.885
Didn't taste too bad, actually.
And it's working, isn't it?

19:09.605 --> 19:10.765
I think it's that way.

19:32.485 --> 19:33.725
You deserve this, Maud.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.285
What do you reckon? Giant spider?

19:41.365 --> 19:43.045
Ancient, super evil witch?

19:44.165 --> 19:47.725
I'm going with a giant ghost spider
evil witch wizard hybrid.

20:00.565 --> 20:02.965
Ivy, get out of here!
There's a giant spider-ghost.

20:03.045 --> 20:04.565
Or a witch-wizard. We don't know.

20:06.645 --> 20:07.765
No, Maud.

20:11.925 --> 20:13.045
I don't think there is.

20:15.845 --> 20:18.125
It's you Ivy, isn't it?

20:19.085 --> 20:20.365
You're behind all of this.

20:26.405 --> 20:30.725
That's another surprise arranged.
For a girl who hates surprises.

20:31.245 --> 20:33.085
Hope it's enough to avert disaster,

20:33.165 --> 20:36.485
and Sybil realizes, after today,
life's a lot more fun

20:36.565 --> 20:38.205
when you don't know
what's going to happen.

20:38.285 --> 20:39.365
Yeah. Come on.

20:40.965 --> 20:42.605
You wanted to destroy the school?

20:43.125 --> 20:45.285
No. I love it here.

20:45.365 --> 20:48.805
I only used the old game for inspiration
and copied the symbols, that's all.

20:48.885 --> 20:50.485
You still haven't told us why.

20:52.245 --> 20:53.285
It's my hobby.

20:54.245 --> 20:55.765
I make them for myself, but...

20:55.845 --> 20:57.245
this one I released.

20:57.845 --> 20:59.045
To steal magic?

20:59.125 --> 21:01.245
Just a pinch from each girl
to increase my own.

21:02.205 --> 21:05.685
But everyone got so addicted.
It got out of hand.

21:06.405 --> 21:07.885
I just wanted people to like me.

21:08.605 --> 21:09.965
By stealing their magic?

21:10.485 --> 21:12.805
It's okay for you, you've got friends.

21:12.885 --> 21:15.125
People ignore me, like I'm invisible.

21:16.845 --> 21:17.725
Know what that's like?

21:19.325 --> 21:20.485
I just...

21:20.565 --> 21:23.125
thought if I had more magic, then...

21:24.365 --> 21:25.245
I'd be more popular.

21:27.245 --> 21:28.365
Don't tell on me, please.

21:29.485 --> 21:30.645
I don't want to get thrown out.

21:30.725 --> 21:32.805
Only if you promise to fix all this,
right away.

21:32.885 --> 21:35.365
Delete the game, return all of the magic.

21:35.925 --> 21:38.765
Make a new game that's fun,
that doesn't pinch magic

21:38.845 --> 21:40.765
and let everyone know that you made it.

21:43.645 --> 21:45.205
Then they'll all want to be your friend.

21:47.325 --> 21:49.005
Now, tell us where they are.

21:49.805 --> 21:52.005
-Who?
-The people that have been going missing.

21:52.085 --> 21:54.685
-Where are you keeping them?
-What are you talking about?

21:55.325 --> 21:56.805
It's not you vanishing them?

21:57.125 --> 21:59.125
The game takes magic, not people.

21:59.965 --> 22:01.805
If anyone's gone missing,
it's nothing to do with me.

22:06.445 --> 22:08.005
We'll find them.

22:08.085 --> 22:10.885
I'll go and try and find Enid,
and then we'll meet up in my room,

22:10.965 --> 22:12.125
and decide what to do next.

22:12.925 --> 22:14.125
We're not giving up, Maud.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.285
If it's not the game,
what else connects them?

22:52.365 --> 22:54.285
Get your hand off me!

23:03.325 --> 23:05.285
Well, maybe he had a belly full of flies.

23:07.765 --> 23:09.485
-You stupid--
-I am so sorry.

23:12.245 --> 23:13.765
Looks like powder.

23:15.485 --> 23:16.925
Or clay dust.

23:32.765 --> 23:34.285
What you doing, Maud?

23:34.365 --> 23:36.165
I... See...

23:36.245 --> 23:38.605
I think, I'm worried
that your mum might...

23:39.685 --> 23:42.085
I think your mum might have something
to do with everyone going missing.

23:42.165 --> 23:45.405
Is this a joke? This is my mum
we're talking about, remember?

23:45.485 --> 23:46.925
I know, I'm sorry.

23:47.005 --> 23:49.325
But she's the only link
between all the missing people.

23:49.405 --> 23:52.245
Why would she do that? And how, even?

23:52.325 --> 23:53.405
She's not magic anymore.

23:53.485 --> 23:55.125
So where did that muffin come from?

23:55.925 --> 23:57.285
That is your evidence?

23:57.365 --> 23:58.725
A muffin?

23:58.805 --> 24:01.565
Well, it's a good job it wasn't a
fudge brownie, or she'd be really guilty.

24:01.645 --> 24:02.885
This isn't a joke, Mildred.

24:02.965 --> 24:04.485
I'm not laughing, Maud.

24:05.765 --> 24:08.205
She saved your cat, remember,
and this is how you thank her?

24:08.285 --> 24:10.645
The old Mildred would've believed me.

24:10.725 --> 24:12.285
What is that supposed to mean?

24:12.365 --> 24:13.765
You're the one who's acting different.

24:13.845 --> 24:16.845
No, ever since your mum got here
you've changed.

24:17.605 --> 24:19.405
So that's what this is really about.

24:20.605 --> 24:22.845
You know what, I've been through a lot
this term already

24:22.925 --> 24:24.285
and I'm glad my mum's here.

24:24.365 --> 24:27.325
But... you're just-- You're just jealous!

24:27.405 --> 24:28.685
Jealous of what? Of you?

24:28.765 --> 24:31.165
Yes! Because I'm the best witch now,

24:31.245 --> 24:33.245
from the best witchy family,
and you can't handle it!

24:33.325 --> 24:36.245
No, Mildred. You're the worst witch
and you always will be.

24:59.005 --> 25:00.165
Shh.

25:18.445 --> 25:20.205
Happy birthday!

25:20.285 --> 25:21.725
Happy birthday!

25:22.205 --> 25:23.885
Better now than never, right?

25:23.965 --> 25:25.925
No magic. Made with love.

25:26.645 --> 25:27.525
Not working?

25:28.765 --> 25:30.285
Teachers must have had it shut down.

25:36.245 --> 25:38.805
We've set up a special message from
Esme in the mirror room,

25:38.885 --> 25:40.565
then we'll eat a ton of sweets.

25:41.005 --> 25:42.605
The sweets are complimentary.

25:42.685 --> 25:43.685
Yes!

25:43.765 --> 25:46.965
And by that, I mean you can buy them,
full price, with my compliments.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.045
Oh.

25:48.485 --> 25:49.325
What?

25:49.965 --> 25:52.125
And when we're feeling sick
from all the sweets--

25:52.205 --> 25:53.685
Then we'll play some fun games.

25:53.765 --> 25:56.045
I have an idea, for a game.

25:59.885 --> 26:02.245
It's called "Pin the Wart on the Witch."

26:03.325 --> 26:04.525
Sounds great, Ivy.

26:04.605 --> 26:05.925
Tell us more.

26:06.405 --> 26:10.685
Think "Pin the Tail on the Donkey,"
only the witch is on a broomstick,

26:10.765 --> 26:13.405
and we splatter a million warts on her
using magic.

26:33.925 --> 26:35.205
Don't cry, Sybil.

26:40.485 --> 26:41.485
My third vision.

26:42.725 --> 26:43.725
But it's okay.

26:44.685 --> 26:46.125
All that worrying for nothing.

26:50.125 --> 26:52.485
Turns out they were happy tears after all,

26:53.205 --> 26:57.485
because my two best friends have thrown
me the best surprise party ever.

27:03.965 --> 27:05.525
Hi, Maud. Have you seen Mildred?

27:05.605 --> 27:06.645
Um...
