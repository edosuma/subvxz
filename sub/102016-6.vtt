04:55.366 --> 04:57.995
My parents said
that your "midsemester break"

04:58.080 --> 05:00.035
was because the daughter
of the headmaster

05:00.143 --> 05:01.077
used black magic

05:01.162 --> 05:03.396
- and killed another student.
- Well, that's not true.

05:03.938 --> 05:06.900
Um, the reason for the break was
because of all the monster...

05:08.735 --> 05:10.444

05:10.528 --> 05:11.654

05:39.764 --> 05:41.420
When you two
lovebirds left us

05:41.505 --> 05:44.758
in the prison world,
Malivore consumed me.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.685
Then he built this place
to torture me,

05:48.770 --> 05:52.555
forcing me to serve the humans
and creatures stuck in here.

05:52.694 --> 05:54.111

05:54.196 --> 05:55.739

05:56.471 --> 05:58.689

why not just break out?

05:58.782 --> 06:00.046

think of that?

06:03.128 --> 06:04.980

06:05.065 --> 06:06.358
I can't get them off.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.321
I finally found a passing sphinx

06:08.406 --> 06:10.846
who was able to read
the inscription on the side.

06:11.028 --> 06:13.901
Apparently, they're
spelled to only come off

06:13.993 --> 06:15.744

06:15.828 --> 06:17.453
you would never do."

from customers.

06:25.675 --> 06:28.225
Speaking of which,

06:28.496 --> 06:30.788
why'd your little
Tribrid girlfriend

06:30.873 --> 06:32.908
leave you to wander
here all alone?

06:33.157 --> 06:34.559

06:34.742 --> 06:36.613
Don't tell me
you broke up.

06:36.698 --> 06:37.997
She didn't leave me.

06:38.300 --> 06:40.692
We both escaped
to the real world and then...

06:42.260 --> 06:45.188
...something happened,
and I got sent here.

06:45.958 --> 06:48.036
And now you're stuck

Strange she hasn't done it
already, though, isn't it?

06:53.977 --> 06:57.119
Of course, time moves
differently in here.

Malivore left me with this, too.

07:29.820 --> 07:33.531

They are in trouble.

10:48.932 --> 10:50.697
Okay,
so, game plan...

10:50.782 --> 10:52.708
Faction Feud?
Mini-field day?

10:52.793 --> 10:54.067
- What you got, MG?
- Right, right, right.

10:54.151 --> 10:56.320
Um, I got, uh...

10:59.428 --> 11:01.138
No.

11:01.885 --> 11:03.059
What?

11:03.553 --> 11:07.026
Kaleb convinced me to start
putting myself first.

11:07.271 --> 11:09.184
I-I don't want

11:09.269 --> 11:10.805
to entertain anyone.

11:10.890 --> 11:13.538
- Yeah, no, that's not...
- No, no, no, you're right.

11:13.623 --> 11:16.231
Okay, listen,
Alyssa broke my heart.

11:16.316 --> 11:18.084
So if I'm being honest
with myself,

11:18.169 --> 11:19.754
I need a minute.

11:20.202 --> 11:22.454
- Thank you, thank you.
- No, no, it's...

11:23.883 --> 11:24.883
That is not my fault.

11:24.968 --> 11:26.094
All right, focus.

11:26.179 --> 11:28.180
- What can we do?
- Um...

11:28.620 --> 11:30.142
nothing.

11:30.227 --> 11:31.687
I mean, it's pointless
without the other

11:31.771 --> 11:33.439
students here
to make it seem fun.

11:33.524 --> 11:35.150
- We should postpone.
- We can't.

11:35.356 --> 11:37.557
We had to memorize the Salvatore
charter in third grade.

11:37.642 --> 11:39.881
Mystic Falls requires us to have
a certain number of students

11:39.965 --> 11:41.382
to be considered a school.

11:41.466 --> 11:43.493
Because if we don't
have enough students,

11:43.578 --> 11:45.538
we have to close the school.

11:45.910 --> 11:48.412
(clears throat)

12:02.789 --> 12:05.333
Excuse me, that's my locker.

12:05.663 --> 12:07.122
I know.

12:07.207 --> 12:08.971
Dorian!
(laughs)

12:09.056 --> 12:11.004
Are you teaching here now?

12:11.160 --> 12:12.327
Worse.

12:12.415 --> 12:13.875
I'm the new principal.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.863
Emma made me promise

12:16.948 --> 12:20.212
to get a job that was...
monster-free.

12:20.505 --> 12:21.945
Fortunately,
your dad told me

12:22.030 --> 12:24.385
there was an opening here.
Well, I'm glad you're here.

12:24.470 --> 12:27.124
- And thank you for this.
- Oh.

12:27.209 --> 12:28.793
Don't thank me.

12:28.974 --> 12:30.768
Wasn't my idea.

12:35.645 --> 12:38.064
Oh, hey. Welcome back.

12:38.829 --> 12:40.246
KALEB:
All right, you guys.

12:40.450 --> 12:42.535
You're gonna love this part.

12:42.620 --> 12:44.830
Oh, and no sudden moves.

12:45.031 --> 12:47.114
Our werewolf pack is
as legendary

12:47.199 --> 12:49.101
as they are dangerous.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.698
Ah.

12:53.681 --> 12:55.932
999...

12:56.017 --> 12:57.824
1,000. (Grunts)

12:58.084 --> 13:00.002
Nice, guys.

13:00.086 --> 13:01.504
Yeah.

13:01.588 --> 13:04.257
Oh, hey, sorry, didn't
see you guys there.

13:04.341 --> 13:07.493
This is... Jed.

13:07.594 --> 13:09.303
Our alpha.

13:09.388 --> 13:11.306
Is this the whole pack?

13:11.391 --> 13:12.683
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

13:12.768 --> 13:14.603
That's intentional.
At Salvatore,

13:14.688 --> 13:17.900
we pride ourselves on having
a high wolf-to-alpha ratio.

13:20.160 --> 13:22.797
Um, Hope is also a wolf.

13:22.882 --> 13:24.689
I'm sure she'd love
to tell you more

13:24.774 --> 13:27.492
about life here at
Salvatore. Hope?

13:27.577 --> 13:28.535
Yeah.

13:28.620 --> 13:31.039
It's great, um...

13:31.124 --> 13:32.708
You know, we...

13:32.834 --> 13:35.044
- throw a lot of cool parties.
- Yeah.

13:35.129 --> 13:37.297
HOPE:
Um...

13:37.395 --> 13:39.478
We play a lot
of dodgeball.

13:39.634 --> 13:41.631
It's, um...

13:41.716 --> 13:43.384
(shouts)

13:48.599 --> 13:50.225
Uh, thanks, Hope.

13:50.310 --> 13:52.145
How about we, uh,
keep it moving, Jed?

13:52.514 --> 13:54.808
Yeah, uh, right this way.

13:57.197 --> 13:59.325
I think those two are a no.

13:59.418 --> 14:01.629
(chuckles) You think?

14:03.266 --> 14:05.059
(groans)

14:05.872 --> 14:07.778
Okay, what the hell was that?

14:07.862 --> 14:09.140
You looked like you were
about to explode.

14:09.224 --> 14:11.142
It's nothing. I'm fine.

14:12.995 --> 14:15.726
Look, Hope, if you go off
like a magic time bomb,

14:15.811 --> 14:17.708
it cannot exactly make
this place seem safe.

14:17.792 --> 14:20.044
I can control it.
I can control it, I swear.

14:20.128 --> 14:22.004
This is my home.

14:22.088 --> 14:24.924
I can't stand by
and lose that, too.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.861
Have you ever
fought in a war?

14:30.946 --> 14:32.155
Done it.

14:32.240 --> 14:33.891
- Betrayed a friend?
- Please.

14:34.212 --> 14:36.101
Have you fallen in love?

14:36.707 --> 14:38.978
(sighs) Done it.

14:39.501 --> 14:41.118
And then murdered them?

14:41.203 --> 14:43.233
Of course.
(chuckles)

14:43.317 --> 14:45.215
Now you see my dilemma.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.743
There's nothing
I wouldn't do.

14:48.489 --> 14:50.491
You've got to hand it
to Malivore.

14:50.733 --> 14:53.402
He knows where
to stick the knife.

14:55.069 --> 14:56.814
(groans)

14:57.399 --> 14:59.474
Another way he punishes me.

14:59.953 --> 15:02.601
The illusion of time passing.

15:02.808 --> 15:05.756
We're only open
from 8:00 to 5:00 technically.

15:05.918 --> 15:07.765
Isn't that better?

15:07.979 --> 15:09.722
No, don't you see?

15:09.807 --> 15:13.441
I spend all night
dreading the next day.

15:13.526 --> 15:14.848
Knowing that this

15:15.028 --> 15:16.977
wretched cycle is doomed

15:17.062 --> 15:18.891
to begin all over again.

15:19.104 --> 15:21.650
Malivore knows
it's the anticipation

15:21.735 --> 15:23.278
that gets you.

15:23.817 --> 15:25.651
Everything in here...

15:26.424 --> 15:29.448
is psychological torture.

15:29.869 --> 15:32.037
The freezer's always locked!

15:32.427 --> 15:35.278
He's trying to drive me
insane!

15:39.972 --> 15:41.473
Or not.

15:41.664 --> 15:42.999
You remember
what he said

15:43.084 --> 15:45.096
about when he made
you human last time?

15:45.181 --> 15:47.314
He was trying
to teach you a lesson.

15:47.399 --> 15:50.967
And what lesson would this be?
Never work in food service?

15:51.778 --> 15:54.113
The customer's always right.

15:55.957 --> 15:57.550
He wants you
to humiliate yourself

15:57.640 --> 15:59.725
in front
of the human debris.

15:59.809 --> 16:01.935
Well, he can forget it.

16:02.019 --> 16:04.855
Because singing
that asinine song

16:04.939 --> 16:06.886
is something I'll...

16:08.818 --> 16:11.111
...oh, never do.

16:11.195 --> 16:12.612
What's worse

16:12.696 --> 16:15.199
torture than hiding
something in plain sight?

16:16.575 --> 16:18.327
Come on, you want
to be free or not?

16:24.861 --> 16:27.014
(quietly): ♪ If you're happy and
you know it, clap your hands. ♪

16:27.098 --> 16:29.767
Oh, I think it has

16:34.844 --> 16:38.500

17:18.469 --> 17:20.224
(Landon groans softly)

17:27.542 --> 17:29.410
Wakey, wakey.

17:29.735 --> 17:31.149
By the way,

17:31.233 --> 17:33.610
I lied about
our little deal.

17:33.694 --> 17:35.237
The mythical door
out of Malivore

17:35.321 --> 17:37.072
only lets one person through.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.241
We couldn't have
both used it to get out.

17:39.325 --> 17:41.118
Then why are you
chaining us together?

17:41.202 --> 17:43.745
Because I'm not looking
for the door.

17:43.829 --> 17:45.205
Malivore wants

17:45.289 --> 17:47.874
to torture me
by giving me

17:47.958 --> 17:50.624
a key and having me
search endlessly

17:50.709 --> 17:52.087
in the dark for some

17:52.171 --> 17:54.756
escape hatch that's
probably not even there?

17:55.120 --> 17:56.299
Pass.

17:56.383 --> 17:58.760
It probably only leads
to the prison world where

17:58.844 --> 18:00.333
Malivore's body's
trapped anyway.

18:00.452 --> 18:02.317
Besides...

18:02.686 --> 18:05.486
I have a better escape plan.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.685
You.

18:08.061 --> 18:09.396
Me?

18:09.480 --> 18:10.647
(grunting):
Mm. Mm-hmm.

18:10.731 --> 18:12.481
I-I can't escape this place.

18:13.089 --> 18:15.175
(laughing raucously)

18:17.986 --> 18:20.071
Oh, oh, oh...

18:20.282 --> 18:22.174
dear boy.

18:22.285 --> 18:24.637
No one would ever think
you could escape

18:24.722 --> 18:26.037
by yourself.

18:26.121 --> 18:27.998
Oh!

18:28.082 --> 18:30.876
But you were right
about Hope.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.044
And I've seen her mind.

18:33.128 --> 18:36.009
She is
her father's daughter.

18:36.302 --> 18:39.798
She'll cross every line
to save what she loves.

18:40.099 --> 18:43.946
She'll do whatever it takes,
unlike...

18:44.265 --> 18:45.974
you, who just...

18:46.058 --> 18:48.393
waits to be saved.

18:48.688 --> 18:50.562
(laughs)

18:52.625 --> 18:54.585
Come on!

18:55.856 --> 18:57.523
(indistinct chatter)

18:57.702 --> 18:59.328
I can't seem
to get away from you.

18:59.571 --> 19:01.173
Sorry, is this
seat taken?

19:01.258 --> 19:02.741
It belongs to my lab partner.

19:03.141 --> 19:04.826
But the position

19:04.910 --> 19:07.840
is currently open
and accepting applications

19:07.925 --> 19:09.776
if you think
you'd be a strong candidate.

19:09.861 --> 19:10.957
Mm, that would depend

19:11.041 --> 19:12.779
on what benefits
you offer.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.069
(school bell rings)

19:15.154 --> 19:17.426
Someone's having
a good first day.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.872
Everyone's been really nice.

19:19.957 --> 19:22.280
And the teachers have
been really helpful.

19:22.437 --> 19:26.024
I honestly didn't expect
to feel so...

19:28.340 --> 19:29.800
What's that?

19:29.885 --> 19:31.594
Sorry,
I'm nosey, but...

19:31.708 --> 19:33.016
what's that?

19:35.733 --> 19:37.484
Just a letter from my sister
telling me

19:37.568 --> 19:39.027
not to worry
about her.

19:39.111 --> 19:40.612
You worry about her a lot?

19:40.696 --> 19:42.155
Apparently I don't.

19:42.239 --> 19:43.740
Because I haven't thought
about her once today.

19:43.824 --> 19:45.075
(bag zips)

19:45.159 --> 19:46.243
Sorry.

19:46.327 --> 19:48.370
Um, I'm sorry.

19:51.081 --> 19:52.374
(door opens)

19:52.458 --> 19:53.583
Hey, man.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.377
Got a sweet new campaign.

19:55.461 --> 19:58.481
Want to tempt the 20-sided
mistress of fate with me?

19:58.566 --> 19:59.984
Sure.

20:00.701 --> 20:02.119
What's that?

20:02.874 --> 20:04.432
Um...

20:04.706 --> 20:07.126
it's how me and Alyssa
would talk long-distance

20:07.211 --> 20:08.610
before, um...
(knocking)

20:08.991 --> 20:10.217
Uh, hey, man.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.727
Can I grab you
for a second?

20:12.812 --> 20:14.823
I just want
to apologize

20:14.981 --> 20:17.567
- for, uh...
- Hooking up with his girlfriend?

20:18.843 --> 20:20.542
Yeah. That.

20:20.853 --> 20:22.980
(mirror chimes)

20:23.489 --> 20:25.543
MG:
It's Alyssa.

20:25.723 --> 20:27.725
- We'll give you a minute.
- MG: Actually...

20:29.839 --> 20:31.465
No.

20:31.747 --> 20:33.081
I don't want to talk to her.

20:33.165 --> 20:34.708
And, Wade?

20:34.792 --> 20:36.960
I don't actually
like playing D&D.

20:37.044 --> 20:38.795
Just because I read comics books

20:38.879 --> 20:40.755
doesn't mean I have
no dignity at all.

20:40.839 --> 20:42.007
And, Jed,

20:42.091 --> 20:43.174
that's not my job to make you

20:43.258 --> 20:44.718
feel better about being a jerk.

20:44.802 --> 20:47.554
So, no,
apology not accepted.

20:47.638 --> 20:50.766
I should do this
a lot more often.

20:54.349 --> 20:56.529
Crisis averted.

20:56.614 --> 20:58.148
I called some parents.

20:58.232 --> 21:00.025
We now have
30 students.

21:00.109 --> 21:02.396
It's enough to satisfy
the town charter.

21:03.412 --> 21:06.539
This is not 30 students,
it's 30 names.

21:06.654 --> 21:09.255
You have Landon and
Rafael listed on there.

21:09.340 --> 21:11.009
Meaning we're still down two.

21:13.235 --> 21:15.362
I hate to say this,

21:15.541 --> 21:16.932
but maybe we need
to bring Josie back.

21:17.016 --> 21:18.350
Dad, no.

21:18.516 --> 21:21.143
For her sake, we have
to find another way.

21:21.299 --> 21:22.691
This is a disaster.

21:22.782 --> 21:24.136
All right, the tour's
bleeding students.

21:24.220 --> 21:25.363
(stammers)

21:25.569 --> 21:27.247
We got to pull
out all the stops.

21:27.619 --> 21:29.454
Okay, what can I do to help?

21:31.336 --> 21:33.003
- What?
- LIZZIE: Jed,

21:33.649 --> 21:35.514
who is leading the tour?

21:35.686 --> 21:37.560
HOPE: I know you
guys have already seen

21:37.645 --> 21:40.427
this room, but a lot
of really great moments

21:40.512 --> 21:43.515
happen here that you wouldn't
assume just by looking at it.

21:46.632 --> 21:48.698
This is where we eat together.

21:48.782 --> 21:51.326
And we have
our assemblies here.

21:51.410 --> 21:52.869
Birthday parties.

21:52.968 --> 21:54.803
Decade dances.

21:54.983 --> 21:56.967
(laughter)

21:58.125 --> 22:00.377
HOPE (echoes):
We have to let them go.

22:02.379 --> 22:04.297
Um, and this is where
some of our students

22:04.381 --> 22:07.710
discovered their powers
for the first time.

22:07.795 --> 22:09.421
(laughs)

22:09.506 --> 22:11.257
HOPE (whispers):
Don't let me go.

22:11.342 --> 22:13.051
LANDON:
Never.

22:13.348 --> 22:17.602
And we recently had
our first school musical.

22:17.686 --> 22:19.354
(cheering, applause)

22:22.024 --> 22:25.508
LANDON:
Hope Mikaelson. Always.

22:26.767 --> 22:28.852
And...

22:29.611 --> 22:31.446
I can't...

22:33.614 --> 22:35.321
LANDON:
I love you, Hope Mikaelson.

22:55.767 --> 22:57.101
Everyone's gonna be fine.

22:57.186 --> 22:59.021
LIZZIE:
It's not your fault.

23:01.936 --> 23:03.447
ALARIC:
Uh, just...

23:03.532 --> 23:05.074
give her a minute.

23:05.159 --> 23:06.410
In the meantime,

23:06.495 --> 23:08.278
we need to handle
damage control.

23:08.362 --> 23:10.884
Okay? Because we need at least
two of these three to register.

23:10.969 --> 23:12.726
Just as soon as
they, you know,

23:12.811 --> 23:14.622
- regain consciousness.
- KALEB: Okay.

23:14.707 --> 23:16.482
So, divide and conquer?
I'll take

23:16.567 --> 23:18.173
the cute vampire, I guess.

23:21.123 --> 23:22.688
Nope. I'll take him.

23:22.791 --> 23:24.985
Fine. I'll have the witch
with the cool accent.

23:25.070 --> 23:27.067
Eh, actually,
you two didn't see,

23:27.152 --> 23:29.090
but she was
kind of vibing me, so...

23:29.174 --> 23:30.467
figured I could go in

23:30.551 --> 23:31.801
and seal the deal.

23:31.885 --> 23:33.340
Ew.

23:33.425 --> 23:37.352
Wait, that leaves me
with High-and-Mighty Granger.

23:40.043 --> 23:42.102
Like Hermione Granger,
but just more stuck-up?

23:42.187 --> 23:43.563
(chuckles) Yeah. Lizzie,

23:43.647 --> 23:46.087
I say this with love
and absolute acceptance

23:46.172 --> 23:47.674
for who you are,
but you're gonna need

23:47.759 --> 23:49.616
to censor yourself
just a little bit, okay?

23:49.701 --> 23:51.571
No matter how
annoying she is,

23:51.655 --> 23:53.910
just go along with it, okay?

23:57.099 --> 23:59.226
So, this is your big plan?

23:59.854 --> 24:02.706
Just wait for Hope to show up?

24:02.886 --> 24:05.013
Do you have somewhere to be?

24:05.836 --> 24:08.093
It's infinite darkness.

24:08.177 --> 24:11.591
I'm not wasting my energy
looking for some mythical door

24:11.675 --> 24:13.593
that's probably
not even there.

24:13.677 --> 24:16.513
Plus, isn't waiting to be
saved what you were doing

24:16.597 --> 24:17.681
when you found me?

24:23.060 --> 24:24.973
Is there any inscription
or anything on the key?

24:25.058 --> 24:26.459
Like, with the shackles?

24:26.544 --> 24:30.380
Just a few words about
a snowstorm, or something.

24:30.777 --> 24:32.306
Well, maybe the words
are a riddle or a clue.

24:32.390 --> 24:34.308
What exactly does it say?

24:34.393 --> 24:36.561
Knock yourself out.

24:36.646 --> 24:40.316
Literally. I liked you better
when you were unconscious.

24:42.101 --> 24:43.910
"Blizzard Breeze"?

24:44.307 --> 24:46.543
I remember that name
from working at the Grill.

24:47.208 --> 24:49.045
Yeah, they're a company.
They make appliances,

24:49.129 --> 24:51.673
like refrigerators
and coolers and-and...

24:52.451 --> 24:54.259
freezers.
Freezers.

25:00.283 --> 25:02.452
Wait, no...
(grunting)

25:13.654 --> 25:15.781
No, no, no, no!

25:30.837 --> 25:33.965
(laughs, grunts)

25:34.049 --> 25:36.134
(piano playing)

25:38.017 --> 25:40.102
Oh, you're awake.

25:40.305 --> 25:41.973
Oh, sorry about that earlier.

25:42.057 --> 25:43.389
Hope was just
conducting one

25:43.474 --> 25:45.643
of our new
"defense against magic" drills.

25:47.229 --> 25:48.901
That was a drill?

25:49.004 --> 25:51.648
Uh, yeah, sure, whatever.
But enough about the school.

25:51.733 --> 25:53.484
Let's-let's talk
about you.

25:53.568 --> 25:56.195
What are your dreams,
your-your fears?

25:56.279 --> 25:57.947
One of my fears

25:58.031 --> 26:00.700
is being stuck in a room
with a man who plays piano.

26:00.784 --> 26:02.619
Uh-huh.
(stops playing)

26:02.703 --> 26:05.997
That girl could not control the
magical energy inside of her.

26:06.081 --> 26:08.458
Is she all right?
Yeah, of course.

26:08.542 --> 26:11.878
The-the Salvatore School is
one of the safest places to be.

26:12.674 --> 26:15.995
Then why are the other students
not returning?

26:16.133 --> 26:18.125
Uh, they, uh...

26:18.210 --> 26:20.324
I know the school
is in trouble.

26:20.778 --> 26:23.067
What happens
if we do not register?

26:23.152 --> 26:25.094
It doesn't
even matter to us

26:25.179 --> 26:26.976
whether you register
or not. We're...

26:27.060 --> 26:29.145
- We're good. We're good. (Chuckles)
- Said the man

26:29.253 --> 26:31.422
who took the time
to light candles.

26:33.940 --> 26:35.066
I am sorry,

26:35.151 --> 26:37.634
but I cannot stay in a place

26:37.719 --> 26:39.595
where they will not
tell me the truth.

26:43.167 --> 26:45.252
But for what it is worth,

26:45.495 --> 26:50.375
your playing is not...
unpleasant.

26:56.383 --> 26:57.428
Damn.

26:58.129 --> 26:59.517
(chuckles)

26:59.602 --> 27:02.356
ALARIC: So, Gunter, this
sounds like a perfect match.

27:02.443 --> 27:03.578
You're a fan of history.

27:03.663 --> 27:05.637
That's very important
to our curriculum here.

27:05.722 --> 27:07.016
Perhaps your
parents could sign

27:07.100 --> 27:08.559
a letter of intent.

27:08.643 --> 27:09.894
My parents are dead.

27:10.205 --> 27:13.314
Oh. I, uh,
I'm sorry to hear that.

27:13.398 --> 27:15.775
(clears throat) Perhaps your
legal guardians, then?

27:15.948 --> 27:18.937
My guardians are
from an old vampire line.

27:19.022 --> 27:22.573
They taught me about
history and my family tree.

27:22.657 --> 27:25.201
Ah, well, I'd certainly like
to hear more about it.

27:25.285 --> 27:26.744
Perhaps on the way
to the office.

27:27.206 --> 27:28.746
They also taught me about

27:28.830 --> 27:32.917
how several of us were
murdered by a vampire hunter.

27:33.001 --> 27:34.127
Uh-huh?

27:34.211 --> 27:36.003
They made me swear

27:36.087 --> 27:40.925
an oath of vengeance if
I ever met that vampire hunter.

27:41.009 --> 27:42.594
Uh-huh.

27:46.264 --> 27:50.874
I'm glad we get this time alone,
Headmaster Saltzman.

27:55.302 --> 27:56.730
(blade drops)

27:58.150 --> 28:00.805
GABY:
Well, this is a huge letdown.

28:01.075 --> 28:04.008
My old school in Geneva
had a kitchen twice this size.

28:04.115 --> 28:06.075
It was a renovated castle.

28:07.066 --> 28:08.317
That's great.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.341
A witch who went
to my old school

28:10.426 --> 28:12.129
warned me this place
was run-down.

28:12.214 --> 28:13.584
I think you know her.

28:13.669 --> 28:16.417
Penelope?
She has a lot of opinions.

28:16.662 --> 28:20.589
Everyone is entitled
to an opinion.

28:21.629 --> 28:25.189
So hearing me criticize this place
doesn't bother you at all?

28:26.221 --> 28:27.972
No.

28:28.237 --> 28:31.377
Because Penelope said that
the best part about this school

28:31.462 --> 28:32.822
was your sister Josie.

28:32.907 --> 28:35.354
If this school is so great,
why isn't she here?

28:35.439 --> 28:37.499
Okay, you know what?

28:37.940 --> 28:40.275
This school might not be perfect

28:40.360 --> 28:43.038
or a "renovated castle,"
but it's all we have.

28:43.123 --> 28:45.597
And if it isn't good
enough for you, fine.

28:45.682 --> 28:46.807
Don't go here.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.785
Just leave us behind

28:48.869 --> 28:51.579
and go off and find yourself
in the human world

28:51.663 --> 28:53.731
and make a bunch
of amazing new friends

28:53.816 --> 28:58.205
and forget all about us,
and we'll just lose you forever.

29:05.844 --> 29:07.308
By the way,

29:07.416 --> 29:09.300
I don't think that was about me.

29:16.608 --> 29:19.277
(high-pitched ringing)

29:26.094 --> 29:27.585
CLEO:
Are you all right?

29:32.869 --> 29:35.126
I miss being in a studio.

29:35.959 --> 29:38.402
I was always more of
a sculptor, though.

29:41.277 --> 29:42.611
Do you paint?

29:42.918 --> 29:44.825
I don't want to talk about it.

29:46.676 --> 29:48.217
Are you sure?

29:48.448 --> 29:51.475
Because it seems as if you've
just expressed yourself.

29:55.531 --> 29:58.450
There is a game
my sisters and I used to play.

30:01.608 --> 30:03.154
What do you see?

30:04.402 --> 30:05.903
I have to go.

30:06.252 --> 30:08.823
Because perhaps running
will work this time?

30:11.201 --> 30:12.918
I do not know you,

30:13.489 --> 30:16.422
but I know there is something
inside you that is powerful.

30:17.888 --> 30:20.500
And I would rather not
be knocked unconscious again.

30:20.585 --> 30:21.878
So...

30:23.510 --> 30:25.486
...it is time to talk.

30:28.134 --> 30:29.803
What do you see?

30:36.064 --> 30:38.709
Look. Sworn to vengeance,

30:38.802 --> 30:40.115
blood oath.

30:40.200 --> 30:43.191
I totally get it. But...

30:46.392 --> 30:48.529
...here's why I think
the Salvatore School

30:48.613 --> 30:49.697
can still be
a good fit.

30:49.871 --> 30:52.409
My Godf!
Just stake me.

30:56.791 --> 30:58.167
Let me tell you a story

30:58.331 --> 30:59.373
about a vampire

30:59.457 --> 31:00.958
that I wanted to kill once

31:01.042 --> 31:04.128
who eventually became
my best friend.

31:04.212 --> 31:05.546
It doesn't matter
what you say.

31:05.630 --> 31:07.298
You have killed ubernaturals.

31:07.382 --> 31:09.550
You're not fit to be
the headmaster here.

31:09.634 --> 31:11.720
Nothing will
ever change that.

31:26.067 --> 31:27.638
You couldn't figure out
the cafeteria's

31:27.723 --> 31:29.445
labyrinthine social order?

31:29.829 --> 31:31.447
I prefer this.
(laughs softly)

31:31.902 --> 31:33.481
(chuckles)

31:34.951 --> 31:36.619
(sighs)

31:37.420 --> 31:39.505
Why aren't you in there
with the football team?

31:39.708 --> 31:43.811
Ah, it doesn't feel right
till I've earned my spot back.

31:44.964 --> 31:47.254
Besides, I saw someone
who could use a friend.

31:47.523 --> 31:49.131
(sighs)

31:49.691 --> 31:51.471
It gets easier.

31:52.844 --> 31:54.271
Not having
a sibling around

31:54.363 --> 31:56.443
when they've been your
best friend most of your life.

31:57.405 --> 32:00.094
But... even when it's hard,

32:00.179 --> 32:01.960
I know that Maya
would kick my butt

32:02.045 --> 32:03.771
if I stopped trying.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.399
Don't you ever feel guilty

32:06.483 --> 32:08.901
about how you stayed
behind when they left?

32:09.176 --> 32:10.861
(sighs)

32:11.052 --> 32:12.773
Yeah, for a while.

32:13.575 --> 32:15.493
But then I remembered
what they want most

32:15.578 --> 32:17.121
is for me to be happy.

32:19.186 --> 32:21.230
So I'm trying to be.

32:27.745 --> 32:29.951
I see anger.

32:31.160 --> 32:32.850
Fear.

32:34.027 --> 32:36.153
I see my friends in trouble.

32:37.518 --> 32:38.951
And even though
I'm trying to help them,

32:39.035 --> 32:40.663
I'm just making it worse.

32:41.172 --> 32:43.351
Like what's inside of me
is gonna keep coming out,

32:43.436 --> 32:44.660
because...

32:45.145 --> 32:46.250
(sighs)

32:46.344 --> 32:48.774
...every room I
go into reminds me of him.

32:49.331 --> 32:51.152
I am sorry.

32:52.987 --> 32:54.197
Me, too.

32:56.284 --> 32:59.191
I know I'm supposed
to start moving forward,

32:59.452 --> 33:00.812
but...

33:01.781 --> 33:03.538
I don't know how.

33:04.482 --> 33:06.101
In my experience,

33:06.186 --> 33:08.855
you have already done
the hardest part.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.125
You said it
out loud.

33:13.048 --> 33:14.542
Hmm.

33:14.930 --> 33:16.511
May I ask you something?

33:17.280 --> 33:18.406
If it is

33:18.491 --> 33:22.303
so painful, why not just leave?

33:23.776 --> 33:25.694
This is my home.

33:26.673 --> 33:28.264
I don't know
who I would have become

33:28.349 --> 33:29.892
if it weren't for this school.

33:33.420 --> 33:35.087
Is this place safe?

33:35.172 --> 33:37.033
Sometimes it's dangerous.

33:37.128 --> 33:38.464
But...

33:39.556 --> 33:42.184
it's a place where it's safe
to be yourself.

33:44.391 --> 33:47.687
You are the first person here
who has been honest with me.

33:48.386 --> 33:49.990
A little too late.

33:50.961 --> 33:53.589
We have to close
if we don't have enough students.

33:54.101 --> 33:55.268
I see.

33:56.245 --> 33:57.508
(sighs)

33:57.593 --> 34:01.089
And how would a new student
go about signing up?

34:07.896 --> 34:09.938
(panting)

34:14.402 --> 34:15.402
(grunts)

34:15.485 --> 34:17.197
(groaning)

34:18.280 --> 34:19.984
♪ If you're happy ♪

34:20.069 --> 34:22.237
♪ And you know it,
clap your hands. ♪

34:23.197 --> 34:24.782
(chuckles)

34:27.145 --> 34:30.759
This was how it was always
gonna end for you, my boy.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.487
(coughs)

34:37.007 --> 34:40.469
You just don't have it in you
to win at all costs.

34:50.188 --> 34:53.399
