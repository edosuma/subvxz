WEBVTT

00:36.840 --> 00:39.040
She was killed
by a hit and run driver.

00:39.080 --> 00:40.000
I'm so sorry.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.080
I'm so sorry.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.760
Mind the gap.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.000
You weren't followed?

01:04.000 --> 01:05.280
You weren't followed?

01:06.800 --> 01:10.680
Did you find Damian Curtis?
His phone's shut off.

01:10.720 --> 01:12.000
The last cell tower relay to pick up
his signal was two weeks ago

01:12.000 --> 01:14.520
The last cell tower relay to pick up
his signal was two weeks ago

01:14.560 --> 01:17.360
in Hampshire,
near St. Catherine's Hill.

01:20.880 --> 01:25.560
Do you think he's gone into hiding?
Or been disappeared.

01:25.600 --> 01:28.000
He was with Kalim the night he died.
What?

01:28.000 --> 01:28.760
He was with Kalim the night he died.
What?

01:28.800 --> 01:31.440
Damian's signal puts him with Kalim
near the South Bank

01:31.480 --> 01:33.440
on the night of the referendum.

01:33.480 --> 01:35.640
Minutes before he was killed.

01:37.160 --> 01:39.080
So, if you could track
Damian's whereabouts...

01:39.120 --> 01:41.600
For the Chinese,
this is kids' stuff.

01:42.480 --> 01:44.000
Are you sure
you want to find this guy?

01:44.000 --> 01:44.960
Are you sure
you want to find this guy?

01:47.320 --> 01:48.880
It's just...

01:48.920 --> 01:52.000
All this digging... It might attract
the people who killed Kalim.

01:52.000 --> 01:53.160
All this digging... It might attract
the people who killed Kalim.

02:41.640 --> 02:44.480
Jeremy.

02:44.520 --> 02:48.000
I hear Massimo Ruggero has joined
Dominic Morgan's SPAC.

02:48.000 --> 02:48.920
I hear Massimo Ruggero has joined
Dominic Morgan's SPAC.

02:48.960 --> 02:53.440
That doesn't really concern me,
because Massimo is wounded and weak,

02:53.480 --> 02:55.480
just like Dominic.

03:13.000 --> 03:16.320
I have another project for you.
I'm all ears.

03:16.360 --> 03:19.400
Provided the price is right,
of course.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.000
Of course.

03:20.000 --> 03:20.880
Of course.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.360
I need to find a way to block
a major investment

03:23.400 --> 03:25.560
our friends are making in the UK.

03:29.120 --> 03:34.640
A contract giving the 22.5 billion
Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant

03:34.680 --> 03:36.000
in Somerset
the formal go-ahead is to be signed.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.280
in Somerset
the formal go-ahead is to be signed.

03:37.320 --> 03:39.200
Representatives
from the British government,

03:39.240 --> 03:41.760
both French and Chinese
power corporations,

03:41.800 --> 03:44.000
engaged in the mammoth construction
project are to attend.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.800
engaged in the mammoth construction
project are to attend.

03:50.560 --> 03:52.000
Hi, this is Amina Chowdhrey.

03:52.000 --> 03:52.080
Hi, this is Amina Chowdhrey.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.120
Please leave a message
and I'll get back to you.

03:54.160 --> 03:55.960
Amina, it's Massimo.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.160
Please call me back when you can.

03:58.200 --> 04:00.000
Thank you.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.200
Thank you.

04:01.480 --> 04:02.680
Here he comes.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.400
Hey.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.000
Here.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.520
Here.

04:09.560 --> 04:11.560
Thanks.

04:12.880 --> 04:15.240
So...

04:15.280 --> 04:16.000
Is it true?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.280
Is it true?

04:19.480 --> 04:24.000
I had a brief consensual
relationship with Zhi.

04:24.000 --> 04:24.600
I had a brief consensual
relationship with Zhi.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.440
That explains a lot.

04:27.480 --> 04:30.120
It was a mistake,
and it cost me my job.

04:30.920 --> 04:32.000
But it's not why I gave Zhi hers.

04:32.000 --> 04:32.800
But it's not why I gave Zhi hers.

04:35.440 --> 04:39.000
You're sure about that?
Work is our life.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.000
Professional lines get crossed.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.280
Professional lines get crossed.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.080
You two know that.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.000
Why are we here?

04:48.000 --> 04:48.760
Why are we here?

04:48.800 --> 04:51.120
I wanted you
to be the first to know.

04:52.680 --> 04:56.000
I'm going to be named CEO of
Dominic's investment group tomorrow.

04:56.000 --> 04:56.960
I'm going to be named CEO of
Dominic's investment group tomorrow.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.680
What?

04:58.720 --> 05:02.320
We've got 50 billion
to acquire data companies.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.000
I want my team with me.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.880
I want my team with me.

05:04.920 --> 05:07.120
I want you.

05:07.160 --> 05:09.720
You're kiddin', right?

05:09.760 --> 05:12.000
The Chinese are fighting
a war over data.

05:12.000 --> 05:12.400
The Chinese are fighting
a war over data.

05:12.440 --> 05:15.000
Think of it as a chance
to protect our interests.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.040
You mean your interests?

05:18.760 --> 05:20.000
You think I'd follow you anywhere?
I know what you think.

05:20.000 --> 05:23.000
You think I'd follow you anywhere?
I know what you think.

05:23.040 --> 05:25.960
About Durings... It wasn't me.

05:28.280 --> 05:30.720
Dominic tried to destroy you.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.880
Why would you work for him now?
Because we share a common enemy.

05:33.920 --> 05:36.000
Can you stop trying to make out
like we're in some kind of war?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.120
Can you stop trying to make out
like we're in some kind of war?

05:37.160 --> 05:39.120
This is about your revenge.
It's not revenge.

05:39.160 --> 05:42.160
It's justice for Kalim.

05:43.200 --> 05:44.000
This is not about
who killed Kalim anymore.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.440
This is not about
who killed Kalim anymore.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.160
It's about why he was killed.

05:48.320 --> 05:50.920
Liwei is a banker.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.000
He's not a hitman

05:52.040 --> 05:55.800
or some comic book villain
trying to take over the world.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.200
I'm done.

06:09.440 --> 06:12.040
Massimo, I...

06:12.080 --> 06:15.000
We... need some time to think.

06:19.160 --> 06:21.160
That's all I ask.

06:59.400 --> 07:01.400
Chris?

07:02.840 --> 07:04.000
I waited a long time
to sit in this office.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
I waited a long time
to sit in this office.

07:06.040 --> 07:08.120
Are congratulations in order?

07:09.240 --> 07:11.240
Not yet.

07:12.800 --> 07:15.400
But I have good reason to believe
they will be tomorrow.

07:17.640 --> 07:19.640
I'm happy for you then.

07:23.560 --> 07:25.560
Thank you.

07:28.160 --> 07:30.960
I couldn't have done it
without your help.

07:43.640 --> 07:44.000
Good evening, Mr Morgan.
There you go, thank you.

07:44.000 --> 07:47.680
Good evening, Mr Morgan.
There you go, thank you.

07:47.720 --> 07:51.720
Good evening. Rebecca Farmer
is waiting in your office.

07:51.760 --> 07:52.000
You don't like her much, do you?
I don't know her.

07:52.000 --> 07:55.280
You don't like her much, do you?
I don't know her.

07:57.680 --> 07:59.920
How's the homework coming along?

08:00.840 --> 08:03.480
I find it boring.

08:03.520 --> 08:06.360
Boring is good for you.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.000
No, seriously,
you should check it out.

08:08.000 --> 08:08.640
No, seriously,
you should check it out.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.240
It's scientifically proven.

08:11.280 --> 08:14.480
This was important
to my grandmother.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.000
I won't... I won't give up.

08:16.000 --> 08:16.560
I won't... I won't give up.

08:18.800 --> 08:21.080
What were you doing on your phone?

08:21.120 --> 08:24.000
Looking at that
social media app, Flamestar.

08:24.000 --> 08:24.400
Looking at that
social media app, Flamestar.

08:24.440 --> 08:25.880
How is it?

08:25.920 --> 08:29.480
Lots of interesting conversations
with people all over the world.

08:29.520 --> 08:30.600
About what?

08:30.640 --> 08:32.000
Politics, finance... everything.

08:32.000 --> 08:33.880
Politics, finance... everything.

08:34.920 --> 08:38.640
Are you still going to acquire them?
Flamestar?

08:38.680 --> 08:40.000
Never say never.

08:40.000 --> 08:40.680
Never say never.

09:00.360 --> 09:02.400
Can I offer you something to drink?

09:05.440 --> 09:08.680
Your girl got me some water.
Good.

09:08.720 --> 09:12.000
She's odd, isn't she?
She's brilliant.

09:12.000 --> 09:12.080
She's odd, isn't she?
She's brilliant.

09:12.120 --> 09:16.680
Well, I don't think she likes me.
I'm not sure she likes anyone.

09:16.720 --> 09:20.000
You offered Massimo the job.
Of course.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.680
Even after NYL let him go
for sexual misconduct?

09:22.720 --> 09:26.600
We're gonna need him
more than ever with Hinkley Point.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.000
I expect you to be
his biggest champion tomorrow.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.720
I expect you to be
his biggest champion tomorrow.

09:29.760 --> 09:31.680
I'll play the role to a T.

09:31.720 --> 09:35.160
You're good at that.
I'm not sure that's a compliment.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.000
Did you go see your friend?

09:36.000 --> 09:37.440
Did you go see your friend?

09:37.480 --> 09:39.200
Of course.

09:39.240 --> 09:41.240
And?
He's on the case.

09:59.400 --> 10:00.000
Ah! Carolina.
Dominic.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.920
Ah! Carolina.
Dominic.

10:04.120 --> 10:06.600
Carolina, I'm so glad you're here.
Wouldn't miss it.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.000
Even if our white knight
has a dent in his armour.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.480
Even if our white knight
has a dent in his armour.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.960
Those are just rumours -
they'll fade away.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.880
And Massimo's one of a kind.
He is indeed.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.000
Massimo Ruggero.

10:16.000 --> 10:16.720
Massimo Ruggero.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.600
Let me introduce you to two
of our most important investors.

10:19.640 --> 10:22.560
Rebecca Farmer.
Hope you're feeling the pressure.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.000
You should be.
Nice to meet you.

10:24.000 --> 10:24.520
You should be.
Nice to meet you.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.720
Nice to meet you.
Carolina Elsher.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.400
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you, too.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.760
Please.

10:30.800 --> 10:31.960
Good morning.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.840
Good morning.
Good morning.

10:33.880 --> 10:35.640
I have called
this interim board meeting

10:35.680 --> 10:37.600
before announcing to the city.

10:37.640 --> 10:40.000
Today's decision is based
on years of loyalty...

10:40.000 --> 10:40.920
Today's decision is based
on years of loyalty...

10:42.640 --> 10:48.000
..of hard work,
and an unfailing strategic vision.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.680
..of hard work,
and an unfailing strategic vision.

10:48.720 --> 10:52.240
Well, I'm very very pleased
to confirm our new CEO.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.680
The new CEO of NYL...

10:54.720 --> 10:56.000
Massimo Ruggero.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.160
Massimo Ruggero.

11:01.160 --> 11:03.160
Cheng Liwei.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.000
Thank you for your confidence...
and your good sense.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.160
Thank you for your confidence...
and your good sense.

11:14.520 --> 11:16.520
These are challenging times.

11:16.560 --> 11:17.920
We have targets to meet.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.000
A reputation to protect.

11:20.000 --> 11:20.080
A reputation to protect.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.560
And a battle to win.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.720
A decade ago, the mathematician
Clive Humby declared...

11:25.760 --> 11:28.000
"Data is the new oil."

11:28.040 --> 11:31.120
Data is the world's
most valuable resource today.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.720
But it's not the new oil.

11:33.760 --> 11:35.600
Oil is finite.

11:35.640 --> 11:36.000
Data is not.

11:36.000 --> 11:37.760
Data is not.

11:37.800 --> 11:41.680
As long as there are people,
they will create more data.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.000
Tracking every coffee you buy...

11:44.000 --> 11:46.360
Tracking every coffee you buy...

11:46.400 --> 11:48.800
Every social media post you make...

11:50.080 --> 11:52.000
Every journey you take.

11:52.000 --> 11:52.600
Every journey you take.

11:52.640 --> 11:55.480
Every aspect
of every moment of your life

11:55.520 --> 11:58.960
recorded, analysed,
commodified into data.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
It's a market expected
to be worth...

12:00.000 --> 12:01.000
It's a market expected
to be worth...

12:01.040 --> 12:02.400
One...
Trillion...

12:02.440 --> 12:04.520
..Euros by 2020.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.520
A market we must dominate.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.000
Our opponents are well ahead of us.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.800
Our opponents are well ahead of us.

12:09.840 --> 12:11.080
I should know.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.400
Until recently, he was one of us.

12:13.440 --> 12:16.000
They know our strengths...

12:16.000 --> 12:16.200
They know our strengths...

12:16.240 --> 12:17.800
..our weaknesses.

12:17.840 --> 12:20.040
But we too know his.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.000
Any questions?

12:24.000 --> 12:24.600
Any questions?

12:24.640 --> 12:26.680
How will you defeat them?

12:26.720 --> 12:28.720
Acquisition by acquisition.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.480
Perhaps you could be
a little more specific?

12:34.360 --> 12:38.080
I intend to start
with a social media app.

12:38.120 --> 12:39.880
You've all heard of Flamestar.

12:39.920 --> 12:40.000
We targeted Flamestar

12:40.000 --> 12:41.720
We targeted Flamestar

12:41.760 --> 12:44.840
because it's drawing millions
of new followers each month.

12:44.880 --> 12:48.000
It will be our first,
but certainly not last victory.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.320
It will be our first,
but certainly not last victory.

12:49.360 --> 12:53.280
My understanding is that
your former colleagues at NYL

12:53.320 --> 12:56.000
are in the final stages of acquiring
Flamestar for a Chinese client.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.080
are in the final stages of acquiring
Flamestar for a Chinese client.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.080
That's their understanding, too.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.400
Over there, please.

13:14.120 --> 13:17.920
Could you give us a moment?
Of course, thank you.

13:19.640 --> 13:20.000
Congratulations.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.120
Congratulations.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.520
You were surprised
by my appointment.

13:23.560 --> 13:26.920
I imagine a lot of people were.
No, I wasn't that surprised.

13:26.960 --> 13:28.000
Some people in my position
might feel the need to clean house.

13:28.000 --> 13:31.040
Some people in my position
might feel the need to clean house.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.880
But you've impressed me, Oliver.

13:34.920 --> 13:36.000
And shown your loyalty.

13:36.000 --> 13:36.920
And shown your loyalty.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.200
Thank you.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.000
In fact,
I'm considering you for a promotion.

13:44.000 --> 13:45.400
In fact,
I'm considering you for a promotion.

13:45.440 --> 13:47.920
What did you
have in mind?

13:49.040 --> 13:52.000
A man needs to fit a job
like a hand in a glove.

13:52.000 --> 13:52.480
A man needs to fit a job
like a hand in a glove.

13:52.520 --> 13:54.160
Take Chris, for example.

13:54.200 --> 13:59.200
Head of Risk needs to be cautious,
a stickler for the rules.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.120
Chris is made for that job.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.320
Yeah.

14:04.360 --> 14:05.840
You?

14:05.880 --> 14:08.000
You're insightful,
bold, ideas-driven.

14:08.000 --> 14:10.280
You're insightful,
bold, ideas-driven.

14:10.320 --> 14:12.040
You see things others don't.

14:12.080 --> 14:16.000
I want you to be my successor
as Chief Strategy Officer.

14:16.000 --> 14:16.480
I want you to be my successor
as Chief Strategy Officer.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.920
It's a big job, setting direction
for the bank and pushing growth.

14:25.360 --> 14:27.600
A step toward becoming CEO some day.

14:39.160 --> 14:40.000
Can I have a word?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.160
Can I have a word?

14:44.720 --> 14:47.480
If this is about Flamestar,
I thought you'd be pleased.

14:47.520 --> 14:48.000
I am. This is not about Flamestar.
This is about Hinkley Point C.

14:48.000 --> 14:53.000
I am. This is not about Flamestar.
This is about Hinkley Point C.

14:53.040 --> 14:56.000
This is supposed to be a data war.
Nuclear power is leverage.

14:56.000 --> 14:56.240
This is supposed to be a data war.
Nuclear power is leverage.

14:56.280 --> 14:58.840
A pawn in China's wider strategy.

14:58.880 --> 15:00.360
Control over energy supply

15:00.400 --> 15:03.000
would give China influence
over government policy

15:03.040 --> 15:04.000
on a host of issues,
including data, trade, 5G.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.000
on a host of issues,
including data, trade, 5G.

15:06.040 --> 15:08.280
The deal is meant to be
officially signed this week.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.960
You put it together
when you were at NYL.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
You think you can find a way
to take it apart?

15:12.000 --> 15:15.360
You think you can find a way
to take it apart?

15:15.400 --> 15:18.360
You're talking about
a £20billion deal.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.000
Precisely.

15:20.000 --> 15:20.400
Precisely.

15:22.120 --> 15:23.360
OK.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.800
I need to see
the original paperwork.

15:25.840 --> 15:26.880
We can't get at it.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.000
NYL has taken it off their server.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.640
NYL has taken it off their server.

15:29.680 --> 15:32.720
You're gonna have to find someone
to help you from the inside.

15:38.360 --> 15:39.600
OK.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.000
OK.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.600
OK.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.520
You wanted to see me?
Yes, have a seat.

15:57.680 --> 15:59.720
Quite a lot has happened recently,

15:59.760 --> 16:00.000
and I'm sure it's left you
wondering where you stand.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.680
and I'm sure it's left you
wondering where you stand.

16:03.520 --> 16:07.040
I think you made it pretty clear
before where I stand.

16:07.880 --> 16:08.000
I said you were better
in a client-facing role,

16:08.000 --> 16:10.960
I said you were better
in a client-facing role,

16:11.000 --> 16:13.600
and I still believe that.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.000
I also know that you wanted a chance
to prove yourself as Senior Analyst.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.920
I also know that you wanted a chance
to prove yourself as Senior Analyst.

16:17.960 --> 16:19.200
Yes?

16:19.240 --> 16:21.240
And I'm prepared to give it to you.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.000
Just like that?
Just like that.

16:24.000 --> 16:24.520
Just like that?
Just like that.

16:25.480 --> 16:28.960
You're either setting me up to fail,
or you're trying to buy my loyalty.

16:29.840 --> 16:32.000
Or perhaps I'm just trying
to give you a chance.

16:32.000 --> 16:33.160
Or perhaps I'm just trying
to give you a chance.

16:36.480 --> 16:38.480
If you still want it.

16:39.360 --> 16:40.000
I'm afraid I need an answer now.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.520
I'm afraid I need an answer now.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.080
Yes.

16:43.120 --> 16:45.560
Yes, I want it.

16:45.600 --> 16:47.400
There is one thing.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.000
Massimo is gonna try
and steal Flamestar.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.400
Massimo is gonna try
and steal Flamestar.

16:50.440 --> 16:54.080
To get this past Liwei,
we're gonna need to close.

16:54.120 --> 16:56.000
It's practically closed already.
Great.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.920
It's practically closed already.
Great.

17:43.400 --> 17:44.000
Hi.

17:44.000 --> 17:44.720
Hi.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.280
I'm Nadya Wojcik, I work here.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.560
Yes, I heard about you.

17:52.840 --> 17:54.720
The genius.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.200
I'm Massimo.
Ruggero.

17:57.240 --> 17:59.720
You used to work for Mr Morgan
at NYL.

18:01.160 --> 18:02.720
Youngest ever Head of Trading.

18:04.040 --> 18:06.520
That's right.

18:06.560 --> 18:08.000
You're going after Flamestar.

18:08.000 --> 18:09.120
You're going after Flamestar.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.960
It's a good decision.
Thank you.

18:15.200 --> 18:16.000
It was my recommendation.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.320
It was my recommendation.

18:20.160 --> 18:22.160
Then Dominic was right about you.

18:22.200 --> 18:24.000
I'm glad you're here,
Miss... Wojcik?

18:24.000 --> 18:26.160
I'm glad you're here,
Miss... Wojcik?

18:26.200 --> 18:29.080
Well, I see you two have met
already.

18:29.120 --> 18:30.160
Yes.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.000
Keep an eye on this man, Nadya,
and you will go far.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.120
Keep an eye on this man, Nadya,
and you will go far.

18:33.160 --> 18:35.160
He learned from the best.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.000
She picked Flamestar
right out of the blocks.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.480
She picked Flamestar
right out of the blocks.

18:42.520 --> 18:45.760
In time, she could be
even better than you, my friend.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.800
She just might.

19:43.600 --> 19:44.000
Well?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.360
Well?

19:45.400 --> 19:49.440
The job is hers
as soon as we close Flamestar.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.000
What about Oliver?
You don't need to worry about him.

19:52.000 --> 19:52.840
What about Oliver?
You don't need to worry about him.

19:55.200 --> 19:58.240
But I'm worried about you.
Me?

19:59.600 --> 20:00.000
I imagine...

20:00.000 --> 20:01.680
I imagine...

20:01.720 --> 20:03.000
..you are still upset.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.640
Using my relationship with Massimo
was bad enough.

20:07.680 --> 20:08.000
You told me it would stay
within the bank.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.720
You told me it would stay
within the bank.

20:10.760 --> 20:13.720
But his name was dragged
through the mud.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.760
And yours.

20:18.120 --> 20:20.720
And for that I'm sorry.

20:20.760 --> 20:23.240
You know
you're like a daughter to me.

20:27.320 --> 20:30.600
If you need time to take some time
to gather yourself, take it.

20:30.640 --> 20:32.000
I would never let
anything stand in the way of my job.

20:32.000 --> 20:35.120
I would never let
anything stand in the way of my job.

20:35.160 --> 20:38.520
I will fight Massimo for Flamestar,
and I will win.

20:40.320 --> 20:44.480
I'm still not sure how you mean
to keep Li Bolin onside.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.520
Everyone has a price.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.000
You're with Dominic Morgan now.

20:56.000 --> 20:56.920
You're with Dominic Morgan now.

20:56.960 --> 20:59.280
Didn't see that coming.

20:59.320 --> 21:01.320
No one did.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.000
What is it you want?

21:04.000 --> 21:04.560
What is it you want?

21:04.600 --> 21:07.000
Your controlling interest
in Flamestar.

21:07.040 --> 21:09.720
Which you have thanks to me.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.000
You know how my brother feels
about Dominic Morgan.

21:12.000 --> 21:12.320
You know how my brother feels
about Dominic Morgan.

21:12.360 --> 21:15.880
Your brother, not you.
You deal with me, not Dominic.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.360
Or maybe you prefer
the Chinese get it.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.720
The devil or the deep blue sea, huh?

21:27.280 --> 21:28.000
What if I chose a third option?

21:28.000 --> 21:29.480
What if I chose a third option?

21:29.520 --> 21:31.520
There is no third option.

21:37.840 --> 21:39.840
Can I get the...

21:41.480 --> 21:44.000
Excuse me.

21:44.000 --> 21:44.120
Excuse me.

21:44.160 --> 21:46.160
Hey.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.320
Small world.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.640
Or, it was intentional.

21:51.680 --> 21:52.000
I'm sure Li Bolin wanted us to know
we're both trying to get him in bed.

21:52.000 --> 21:55.680
I'm sure Li Bolin wanted us to know
we're both trying to get him in bed.

21:55.720 --> 21:57.760
Yes, you're good at that.

22:01.800 --> 22:03.800
Massimo, I'm sorry.

22:05.560 --> 22:07.920
Are you?
Yes.

22:10.760 --> 22:14.040
We both know
what really happened between us.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.680
I thought I did.

22:15.720 --> 22:16.000
I'm not making any excuses,
because there isn't any.

22:16.000 --> 22:19.840
I'm not making any excuses,
because there isn't any.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.840
But there were
certain pressures on me.

22:21.880 --> 22:24.000
You're right. There is no excuse.

22:24.000 --> 22:24.960
You're right. There is no excuse.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.760
You let him use you.

22:26.800 --> 22:30.160
My relationship with Liwei
is complicated.

22:30.200 --> 22:32.000
He's done a lot for me.

22:32.000 --> 22:32.440
He's done a lot for me.

22:32.480 --> 22:36.480
And debts must be repaid.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.880
Good for you.

22:38.920 --> 22:40.000
You wouldn't understand.
No, I don't.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.440
You wouldn't understand.
No, I don't.

22:41.480 --> 22:43.200
Yeah. I don't blame you
for hating me.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.640
I have your permission?

22:45.680 --> 22:48.000
How kind.

22:48.000 --> 22:48.280
How kind.

22:48.320 --> 22:51.000
Anyway, I just closed the deal.

22:52.320 --> 22:54.320
Goodbye, Zhi.

23:05.600 --> 23:07.520
I'm sorry I have to work tonight.

23:07.560 --> 23:11.400
We should be celebrating.
That's alright, another time.

23:12.520 --> 23:14.520
I am so proud of you.

23:15.560 --> 23:20.000
My Oliver is the first black
Chief of Strategy Officer at NYL.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.360
My Oliver is the first black
Chief of Strategy Officer at NYL.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.320
Possibly ever, in any bank.

23:26.920 --> 23:28.000
What's wrong?

23:28.000 --> 23:28.960
What's wrong?

23:29.000 --> 23:30.760
Look how I got the job.

23:31.640 --> 23:33.560
What do you mean?

23:33.600 --> 23:36.000
Massimo went behind my back
with Durings.

23:36.000 --> 23:36.720
Massimo went behind my back
with Durings.

23:36.760 --> 23:39.920
Then Liwei used Zhi
to stab Massimo in the back.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.520
Yeah, but you didn't do
anything wrong.

23:41.560 --> 23:44.000
How did I get hired at NYL
in the first place?

23:44.000 --> 23:44.800
How did I get hired at NYL
in the first place?

23:44.840 --> 23:48.680
By helping people cheat on exams,
by stealing private records.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.920
No. You've been on the straight
and narrow ever since, baby.

23:51.960 --> 23:52.000
You don't get it, Toy.

23:52.000 --> 23:53.960
You don't get it, Toy.

23:54.920 --> 23:58.480
Banking's all about dirty tricks.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.000
Do whatever it takes to get ahead,
that's it.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.960
Do whatever it takes to get ahead,
that's it.

24:02.000 --> 24:07.680
Just don't lose sight of who you are
and where we came from.

24:07.720 --> 24:08.000
What,
you mean that one bed council flat?

24:08.000 --> 24:10.000
What,
you mean that one bed council flat?

24:11.080 --> 24:12.880
You want to go back there?

24:12.920 --> 24:16.000
I mean...
You know what I mean, OK?

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
I mean...
You know what I mean, OK?

24:18.040 --> 24:20.600
Look, leave it to me, alright?

24:20.640 --> 24:22.760
I'll sort something special
for tomorrow night.

24:23.960 --> 24:24.000
Just you wait and see.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.560
Just you wait and see.

24:26.600 --> 24:29.600
What kind of special?
Bye!

24:50.280 --> 24:52.200
Massimo.

24:52.240 --> 24:54.160
I'm so happy to see you.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.000
May I come in?

24:56.000 --> 24:56.200
May I come in?

25:01.960 --> 25:03.920
Who's that?
Well...

25:03.960 --> 25:04.000
It's complicated.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.440
It's complicated.

25:06.480 --> 25:08.480
Forget I asked.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.000
I've...

25:12.000 --> 25:12.680
I've...

25:12.720 --> 25:17.960
..always felt the comfort of
clutter...

25:18.000 --> 25:20.000
..myself.

25:21.480 --> 25:24.520
Can I offer you a drink?
Wouldn't say no.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.080
So, let me guess.

25:32.160 --> 25:35.040
The 13th floor aren't happy
I've joined Dominic Morgan.

25:35.080 --> 25:36.000
They will do what they need to

25:36.000 --> 25:37.760
They will do what they need to

25:37.800 --> 25:42.040
in order to protect
what they spent years creating.

25:45.880 --> 25:48.440
Is that a threat?

25:48.480 --> 25:50.480
Do I look threatening?

25:53.640 --> 25:56.840
Surely they don't want China
to win the data war.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
They want the status quo.

26:00.800 --> 26:05.760
Anti-globalists like Dominic,
Rebecca Farmer, Donald Trump...

26:06.760 --> 26:08.000
..would destroy it.

26:08.000 --> 26:08.200
..would destroy it.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.920
Trump doesn't have a chance.

26:10.960 --> 26:15.040
Life has a tendency
to throw the unexpected at you.

26:15.080 --> 26:16.000
You working for Dominic again
being a case in point.

26:16.000 --> 26:18.600
You working for Dominic again
being a case in point.

26:20.560 --> 26:23.240
Thank you.

26:23.280 --> 26:24.000
By the way,
why are you working for Dominic?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.160
By the way,
why are you working for Dominic?

26:27.560 --> 26:29.840
I need answers.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.000
For Kalim.

26:32.040 --> 26:37.080
And Dominic's gonna help you
out of the goodness of his heart?

26:38.520 --> 26:40.000
He's fighting the Chinese
for his own reasons.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.640
He's fighting the Chinese
for his own reasons.

26:43.080 --> 26:46.520
It just so happens
they coincide with mine.

26:47.760 --> 26:48.000
You may not get what you want,

26:48.000 --> 26:50.360
You may not get what you want,

26:50.400 --> 26:52.680
but for your sake...

26:52.720 --> 26:54.880
..I hope that you get what you need.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.920
Without starting a bloody war.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.960
Now that sounds like a threat.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.000
A friendly warning, is all.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.600
A friendly warning, is all.

27:59.920 --> 28:00.000
Thank you for coming.
Don't make me regret it.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.320
Thank you for coming.
Don't make me regret it.

28:03.360 --> 28:05.120
Please, have a seat.

28:05.160 --> 28:08.000
Ms Wu told me you're prepared
to improve your offer.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.120
Ms Wu told me you're prepared
to improve your offer.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.120
And you told me
it wasn't about money for you.

28:12.160 --> 28:13.280
It's not.

28:13.320 --> 28:16.000
Which is why I fail to see what
sort of improvement you can make.

28:16.000 --> 28:16.280
Which is why I fail to see what
sort of improvement you can make.

28:16.320 --> 28:19.800
Well, your mother and father
fled the mainland in 1949.

28:19.840 --> 28:22.320
Yes.
They didn't just lose their home.

28:22.360 --> 28:24.000
Your ancestral temple
in Guangdong was destroyed,

28:24.000 --> 28:24.920
Your ancestral temple
in Guangdong was destroyed,

28:24.960 --> 28:28.440
leaving your ancestors' spirits
no place to rest.

28:28.480 --> 28:31.600
And the Chinese government blocked
all efforts to rebuild the temple.

28:31.640 --> 28:32.000
Which is why this is not
just about money.

28:32.000 --> 28:34.280
Which is why this is not
just about money.

28:34.320 --> 28:37.400
It's personal for me and my family.

28:38.640 --> 28:40.000
Indeed.

28:40.000 --> 28:40.480
Indeed.

28:40.520 --> 28:42.520
Family is everything.

29:05.120 --> 29:09.000
A Chinese spy has been arrested
at an American nuclear plant.

29:09.040 --> 29:12.000
He works for the Chinese company
set to build Hinkley Point C.

29:12.000 --> 29:12.760
He works for the Chinese company
set to build Hinkley Point C.

29:12.800 --> 29:15.040
The arrest has rattled nerves
in Downing Street,

29:15.080 --> 29:18.520
raising questions about entrusting
the nation's energy supply...

29:18.560 --> 29:20.000
..To a hostile power
that spies on its allies.

29:20.000 --> 29:20.640
..To a hostile power
that spies on its allies.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.760
Are you watching?
I am indeed.

29:22.800 --> 29:24.360
Your friend came through.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.680
Have you heard
from your contacts at Whitehall?

29:26.720 --> 29:28.000
They're nervous about the deal,
but not quite nervous enough.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.720
They're nervous about the deal,
but not quite nervous enough.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.920
Time to bring out our Trojan horse.

29:47.720 --> 29:51.200
Congratulations, it suits you.
Why, thank you.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.000
You were across the Hinkley Point
deal with Massimo, weren't you?

29:52.000 --> 29:54.040
You were across the Hinkley Point
deal with Massimo, weren't you?

29:54.080 --> 29:56.880
Yeah, briefly, at the final stages.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.880
It's due to be signed this week,
isn't it? Yes.

29:58.920 --> 30:00.000
I've got some associates
from Beijing flying over

30:00.000 --> 30:01.560
I've got some associates
from Beijing flying over

30:01.600 --> 30:02.840
for the signing of the deal.

30:02.880 --> 30:05.280
I know it was a nightmare
for Massimo to get over the line.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.560
Well, now...

30:07.600 --> 30:08.000
..it's your nightmare.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.600
..it's your nightmare.

30:10.600 --> 30:15.240
Last night a man was arrested
at a nuclear plant in the US,

30:15.280 --> 30:16.000
accused of being a spy.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.080
accused of being a spy.

30:17.120 --> 30:19.040
Ah. Let me guess.

30:19.080 --> 30:22.720
A Chinese national?
Go figure.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.000
What's he got to do with
Hinkley Point?

30:24.000 --> 30:24.560
What's he got to do with
Hinkley Point?

30:24.600 --> 30:27.240
Nothing,
but the optics don't look good.

30:27.280 --> 30:29.200
We don't want to give
nervous politicians

30:29.240 --> 30:31.240
a reason to hold up the deal.

30:32.280 --> 30:36.040
So what do you want me to do?
Make sure they don't find one.

30:37.000 --> 30:40.000
Do Dominic and Massimo
have something to do with this?

30:40.000 --> 30:40.440
Do Dominic and Massimo
have something to do with this?

30:40.480 --> 30:42.480
It's entirely possible.

30:57.040 --> 30:58.240
What?

30:58.280 --> 31:01.400
You're so gonna miss
the action on the floor.

31:01.440 --> 31:04.000
No, you're gonna miss
my action on the floor.

31:04.000 --> 31:05.880
No, you're gonna miss
my action on the floor.

31:05.920 --> 31:07.480
Hmm.
Hmm.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.000
Word is there is some kind of crisis
on Hinkley Point.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.520
Word is there is some kind of crisis
on Hinkley Point.

31:13.560 --> 31:15.560
Ugh, word travels fast.

31:17.560 --> 31:20.000
This spy story
that broke last night...

31:20.000 --> 31:20.200
This spy story
that broke last night...

31:21.240 --> 31:24.760
Massimo and Dominic
may have something to do with it.

31:26.360 --> 31:28.000
Want me to help?
No.

31:28.000 --> 31:29.880
Want me to help?
No.

31:32.360 --> 31:35.400
No man is an island, Oliver.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.000
Not even the man
with the big office.

31:36.000 --> 31:38.320
Not even the man
with the big office.

31:40.080 --> 31:43.920
I'm supposed to be home tonight,
for dinner with the wife, so...

31:45.160 --> 31:49.600
Actually, yeah, if you could help,
that would be amazing.

31:49.640 --> 31:51.640
No problem.

31:56.600 --> 31:59.840
Eleanor?
Hmm?

31:59.880 --> 32:00.000
I'm really glad
you're not going with Massimo.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.520
I'm really glad
you're not going with Massimo.

32:13.680 --> 32:15.640
Hey.

32:15.680 --> 32:16.000
Careful, it's heavy.
I remember.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.920
Careful, it's heavy.
I remember.

32:23.760 --> 32:24.000
You're doing the right thing.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.760
You're doing the right thing.

32:27.520 --> 32:29.520
Then why do I feel like shit?

32:33.760 --> 32:36.240
Where are you going?

32:36.280 --> 32:39.000
Dinner,
with our friend from Flamestar.

32:46.600 --> 32:48.000
It's rather charitable, basically.

32:48.000 --> 32:48.880
It's rather charitable, basically.

32:51.560 --> 32:55.440
You know
I've always been straight with you.

32:55.480 --> 32:56.000
I tell you what I think,
not what NYL thinks I should say.

32:56.000 --> 32:59.520
I tell you what I think,
not what NYL thinks I should say.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.560
And what are you saying now?

33:02.680 --> 33:04.000
In confidence?
Of course.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.040
In confidence?
Of course.

33:06.360 --> 33:08.560
If Li Bolin sides
with Dominic Morgan,

33:08.600 --> 33:12.000
a hostile takeover could be avoided.

33:12.000 --> 33:12.320
a hostile takeover could be avoided.

33:12.360 --> 33:15.360
You would maintain control
over Flamestar.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.440
And with NYL as investor?

33:17.480 --> 33:20.000
Go with them
and you're basically unemployed.

33:20.000 --> 33:20.640
Go with them
and you're basically unemployed.

33:20.680 --> 33:22.720
But rich.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.960
You'll be rich either way.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Can you imagine a future for the
company that you aren't a part of?

33:28.000 --> 33:29.120
Can you imagine a future for the
company that you aren't a part of?

33:29.160 --> 33:33.280
You're saying I should sign with
Dominic Morgan, your competitor?

33:33.320 --> 33:35.320
Depends on what you want.

33:40.240 --> 33:42.240
I know what I want.

33:45.560 --> 33:49.320
I misread you - I'm so sorry.
It's OK, really.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.960
Would you like some coffee?
Yeah, thanks.

34:09.480 --> 34:12.360
I thought I'd find you here.
Hey.

34:12.400 --> 34:15.240
Well?
The agreement's iron-clad.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.000
I made sure of that.
Of course you did.

34:16.000 --> 34:18.000
I made sure of that.
Of course you did.

34:18.040 --> 34:19.840
But I'll keep looking.
Good.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.120
Something wrong?

34:52.160 --> 34:55.320
I just had a disturbing call
from Pietro Marchesi.

34:55.360 --> 34:56.000
He said that Eleanor Bourg
may be working for Dominic Morgan.

34:56.000 --> 34:58.560
He said that Eleanor Bourg
may be working for Dominic Morgan.

34:58.600 --> 35:03.200
For Massimo.
Not much of a shock, is it?

35:03.240 --> 35:04.000
Get rid of her.
And show Massimo our hand?

35:04.000 --> 35:07.520
Get rid of her.
And show Massimo our hand?

35:07.560 --> 35:11.520
Keeping a fox in the henhouse
is a risky strategy.

35:11.560 --> 35:12.000
I'll keep an eye on the hens.

35:12.000 --> 35:13.480
I'll keep an eye on the hens.

35:13.520 --> 35:16.760
If I get rid of her, Massimo
would just look for another fox.

35:17.560 --> 35:19.560
Alright, if you say so.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.880
Are you alright?

35:22.920 --> 35:25.880
Yeah, I'm not feeling great,
but I'll be fine.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.000
What about Li Bolin?
Yeah, I have a call in to Beijing.

35:28.000 --> 35:28.920
What about Li Bolin?
Yeah, I have a call in to Beijing.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.000
Zhi?

35:31.040 --> 35:33.280
Take care.

35:33.320 --> 35:35.320
Thanks, I will.

36:34.640 --> 36:37.920
Clean air! Clean air! Clean air!

36:37.960 --> 36:40.000
Clean air! Clean air! Clean air!

36:40.000 --> 36:40.400
Clean air! Clean air! Clean air!

36:40.440 --> 36:43.560
Clean air! Clean air! Clean air!

36:43.600 --> 36:46.280
Clean air! Clean air! Clean air!

36:46.320 --> 36:48.000
Clean air! Clean air! Clean air!

36:48.000 --> 36:49.320
Clean air! Clean air! Clean air!

36:49.360 --> 36:52.360
Clean air! Clean air! Clean air!

37:09.280 --> 37:11.400
Clean air! Clean air! Clean air!

37:29.640 --> 37:32.600
Come in.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.520
I think I've got something.

37:36.400 --> 37:39.080
There's a section of the budget

37:39.120 --> 37:42.000
that's been redacted from the deal.
Waste management.

37:42.040 --> 37:44.000
It's always hugely under-budgeted.

37:44.000 --> 37:44.080
It's always hugely under-budgeted.

37:44.120 --> 37:47.120
It could piss off
environmental protestors.

37:47.160 --> 37:50.880
Because the cost of nuclear waste
management is enormous.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.000
An oversight...
or deliberate deceit?

37:52.000 --> 37:54.240
An oversight...
or deliberate deceit?

37:54.280 --> 37:57.440
Well,
you'd better get over to Whitehall.

37:57.480 --> 38:00.000
Talk to your friends at the
Atomic Energy Commission. Yes.

38:00.000 --> 38:00.440
Talk to your friends at the
Atomic Energy Commission. Yes.

38:00.480 --> 38:03.480
Aren't you coming with me? I can't.
I have a lunch with an investor.

38:03.520 --> 38:05.120
Good luck.
You too.

38:11.240 --> 38:14.000
Hi.
It's been a while, Massimo.

38:14.040 --> 38:15.160
Too long.

38:15.200 --> 38:16.000
I've been busy.
I heard.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.920
I've been busy.
I heard.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.720
The whole city heard.

38:20.920 --> 38:23.400
I guess you also heard
about the Chinese spy

38:23.440 --> 38:24.000
at the American nuclear plant.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.040
at the American nuclear plant.

38:26.080 --> 38:29.920
It's a bloody PR nightmare, but
we're moving ahead with the signing.

38:29.960 --> 38:32.000
MI6 are having kittens, of course.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.480
MI6 are having kittens, of course.

38:34.520 --> 38:36.760
I should have gone into banking,
not politics.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.640
Far less cut-throat
and much better suits.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.840
There was a time
when you laughed at my jokes.

38:42.880 --> 38:45.200
Is that cos you were being paid to?

38:46.160 --> 38:48.000
I am sorry, Julie.

38:48.000 --> 38:48.720
I am sorry, Julie.

38:48.760 --> 38:51.160
But your PR nightmare's
about to get worse.

38:51.200 --> 38:55.280
We both know that waste management
is wildly underbudgeted.

38:55.320 --> 38:56.000
Rubbish, we set aside
a 100 million contingency fund.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.360
Rubbish, we set aside
a 100 million contingency fund.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.440
That contingency
is to cover the whole project.

39:03.320 --> 39:04.000
What if it is? The budget's not
public. No one could know.

39:04.000 --> 39:06.840
What if it is? The budget's not
public. No one could know.

39:08.880 --> 39:11.160
You didn't know.

39:11.200 --> 39:12.000
Word could leak out.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.560
Word could leak out.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.040
You wouldn't.

39:15.080 --> 39:19.000
Waste management costs
are notoriously hard to predict.

39:19.040 --> 39:20.000
Get it wrong,
and the British taxpayer

39:20.000 --> 39:21.960
Get it wrong,
and the British taxpayer

39:22.000 --> 39:23.560
could be paying for generations.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.720
Cut corners on the clean-up,

39:25.760 --> 39:28.000
and you could be looking at
another nuclear disaster.

39:28.000 --> 39:29.320
and you could be looking at
another nuclear disaster.

39:32.680 --> 39:35.120
And if this became public...

39:35.160 --> 39:36.000
..it would end your career.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.880
..it would end your career.

39:37.920 --> 39:39.920
Unless you blow the whistle.

39:41.800 --> 39:44.000
I don't know what you think
you're playing at, you little shit.

39:44.000 --> 39:44.480
I don't know what you think
you're playing at, you little shit.

39:44.520 --> 39:48.120
There's nothing you, nor I,
can do to derail this deal.

39:48.160 --> 39:51.680
It's as good as done.
I'm sorry you can't help, Julie.

39:52.680 --> 39:54.680
Fuck you, Massimo.

40:16.680 --> 40:19.680
You gonna tell me what's in this?
See for yourself.

40:19.720 --> 40:23.840
But before you do, I'd like
to confirm a couple of things.

40:23.880 --> 40:24.000
Firstly, NYL will match
any offer that Massimo makes.

40:24.000 --> 40:28.040
Firstly, NYL will match
any offer that Massimo makes.

40:28.080 --> 40:29.360
So you said.

40:29.400 --> 40:32.000
Second, whatever you should decide,
this is yours to keep.

40:32.000 --> 40:33.680
Second, whatever you should decide,
this is yours to keep.

40:44.960 --> 40:48.000
Approval to rebuild
your family's ancestral temple.

40:48.000 --> 40:48.240
Approval to rebuild
your family's ancestral temple.

40:48.280 --> 40:51.920
Your ancestors' spirit tablets
will have a home again.

40:51.960 --> 40:56.000
Your parents will be given the face
of having made this possible,

40:56.000 --> 40:56.160
Your parents will be given the face
of having made this possible,

40:56.200 --> 40:58.920
and you will return home
in silken robes.

41:03.760 --> 41:04.000
I can never repay this debt.

41:04.000 --> 41:05.760
I can never repay this debt.

41:10.280 --> 41:12.000
Massimo.
El?

41:12.000 --> 41:12.280
Massimo.
El?

41:13.440 --> 41:15.200
Thank you for Hinkley Point.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.720
Did you find what you needed?
I think so.

41:17.760 --> 41:20.000
And Flamestar? I tried my best
to tank it with Marchesi.

41:20.000 --> 41:20.680
And Flamestar? I tried my best
to tank it with Marchesi.

41:20.720 --> 41:23.000
But I need to get out of NYL.

41:23.040 --> 41:24.840
They're gonna find out.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.680
I need you there
just a little longer.

41:26.720 --> 41:28.000
What about what I need, Massimo?
What do you need?

41:28.000 --> 41:30.560
What about what I need, Massimo?
What do you need?

41:30.600 --> 41:32.000
I want a job.

41:32.040 --> 41:33.040
Two times base,

41:33.080 --> 41:36.000
10 percent of performance
and uncapped on the outside.

41:36.000 --> 41:36.760
10 percent of performance
and uncapped on the outside.

41:37.560 --> 41:39.560
You've changed.
Well?

41:41.360 --> 41:44.000
5 percent of performance.

41:44.000 --> 41:44.280
5 percent of performance.

41:44.320 --> 41:47.440
You got 'til on Monday.
Thank you.

41:47.480 --> 41:49.480
Be careful, Massimo.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.000
You too.

41:52.000 --> 41:52.320
You too.

41:57.120 --> 41:59.160
You wanted to see me?
Yes.

41:59.200 --> 42:00.000
Hinkley Point is trending online,
thriven by protest on Flamestar.

42:00.000 --> 42:03.280
Hinkley Point is trending online,
thriven by protest on Flamestar.

42:04.680 --> 42:08.000
You don't have anything to do with
starting those protests, do you?

42:08.000 --> 42:08.400
You don't have anything to do with
starting those protests, do you?

42:10.360 --> 42:12.160
Yes.

42:12.200 --> 42:14.600
Only Massimo and I knew about this.

42:14.640 --> 42:16.000
I saw the reports on Hinkley Point
on Mr Ruggero's desk.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.880
I saw the reports on Hinkley Point
on Mr Ruggero's desk.

42:18.920 --> 42:22.200
They were left open
to the budget for waste management.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.000
What sharp eyes you have.

42:24.000 --> 42:24.640
What sharp eyes you have.

42:24.680 --> 42:26.320
Did I do wrong?

42:26.360 --> 42:30.360
Next time tell me
before you make a move like that.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.000
But you did good.

42:32.000 --> 42:32.880
But you did good.

42:32.920 --> 42:34.840
You have intuition.

42:34.880 --> 42:37.240
Math is all intuition.
Is it?

42:37.280 --> 42:38.520
Turing said so.

42:38.560 --> 42:40.000
The brain unconsciously accesses
and processes learned data sets.

42:40.000 --> 42:43.360
The brain unconsciously accesses
and processes learned data sets.

42:43.400 --> 42:45.960
Instincts are just machine learning.

42:47.200 --> 42:48.000
Nadya Wojcik, you are
something else.

42:48.000 --> 42:50.720
Nadya Wojcik, you are
something else.

42:50.760 --> 42:52.760
Excuse me.

42:55.280 --> 42:56.000
Liwei, it's been a while.

42:56.000 --> 42:57.040
Liwei, it's been a while.

42:57.080 --> 42:59.760
I wanted you to be the first
to hear the news.

42:59.800 --> 43:01.440
Flamestar.

43:01.480 --> 43:03.480
You win some, you lose some.

43:05.600 --> 43:08.440
It's not too late
to step away from this fight.

43:08.480 --> 43:12.000
Data is not zero sum.
If we could both emerge winners...

43:12.000 --> 43:12.080
Data is not zero sum.
If we could both emerge winners...

43:12.120 --> 43:14.280
Your government
doesn't believe that,

43:14.320 --> 43:16.960
and I don't think you do either.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.640
I was afraid you'd say that.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.000
But I had to try to make peace
one last time.

43:20.000 --> 43:23.080
But I had to try to make peace
one last time.

43:23.120 --> 43:26.760
I appreciate that.
You must be proud of your team.

43:26.800 --> 43:27.840
I am.

43:27.880 --> 43:28.000
Well, you know what they say.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.400
Well, you know what they say.

43:29.440 --> 43:31.440
"Pride comes before a fall."

44:03.960 --> 44:05.840
I hope you don't
mind me dropping by.

44:09.120 --> 44:10.320
Can we talk?

44:12.240 --> 44:14.240
Of course.

44:17.160 --> 44:18.600
How are the kids?

44:19.680 --> 44:22.360
Most of the time
they're in the moment.

44:22.400 --> 44:24.000
Then every once in a while
it hits them.

44:24.000 --> 44:24.880
Then every once in a while
it hits them.

44:25.720 --> 44:28.200
If there's anything I can do...

44:28.240 --> 44:30.200
What are you here for, Massimo?

44:31.160 --> 44:32.000
I was surprised Damian Curtis
didn't come to the funeral.

44:32.000 --> 44:35.040
I was surprised Damian Curtis
didn't come to the funeral.

44:35.080 --> 44:38.800
So was I. I guess you never really
know who your true friends are.

44:38.840 --> 44:40.000
No one's seen him.

44:40.000 --> 44:40.880
No one's seen him.

44:40.920 --> 44:43.120
Not since that day.

44:43.160 --> 44:44.960
Look, I don't understand.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.000
Last I heard,
he had gone down to Hampshire.

44:48.000 --> 44:48.240
Last I heard,
he had gone down to Hampshire.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.680
He was Kalim's friend, not mine.

44:52.560 --> 44:55.320
Did Kalim ever talk to you
about St. Catherine's Hill?

44:56.200 --> 44:59.160
We bought a cabin down
there last year.

44:59.200 --> 45:00.840
Not much more than a shed really.

45:03.160 --> 45:04.000
Did Damian know about this place?
I don't know, maybe.

45:04.000 --> 45:07.280
Did Damian know about this place?
I don't know, maybe.

45:08.120 --> 45:10.320
Can I borrow the key?
Sure.

45:10.360 --> 45:12.000
Thank you.

45:12.000 --> 45:12.280
Thank you.

45:20.480 --> 45:22.200
It's not here.

45:32.000 --> 45:35.360
May I introduce our Chief Strategy
Officer, Oliver Harris?

45:35.400 --> 45:36.000
Mr Harris.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.760
Mr Harris.

45:37.800 --> 45:40.600
This is a great day for our country.

45:40.640 --> 45:43.080
Thank you for your help.
My pleasure.

46:00.280 --> 46:01.800
Shit.

46:01.840 --> 46:03.080
Massimo.

46:09.560 --> 46:11.200
The deal's off.

46:12.040 --> 46:14.400
What?
It was just announced.

46:14.440 --> 46:16.000
The government is
postponing the signing

46:16.000 --> 46:16.440
The government is
postponing the signing

46:16.480 --> 46:18.800
pending a full review
of the financial terms.

47:14.600 --> 47:17.920
Damian?

47:29.920 --> 47:31.760
Damian?

48:17.960 --> 48:21.600
Hinkley C,
shovel ready and now signed off.

48:21.640 --> 48:24.000
It's difficult to say that it's
gonna be a good deal for the UK.

48:24.000 --> 48:24.520
It's difficult to say that it's
gonna be a good deal for the UK.

48:24.560 --> 48:29.120
It makes us look completely chaotic
for investors in this country.

48:29.160 --> 48:32.000
If this project were to unravel,
that would be money wasted.

48:32.000 --> 48:32.360
If this project were to unravel,
that would be money wasted.

48:32.400 --> 48:35.720
Everyone's wondering,
"What's going on?"
