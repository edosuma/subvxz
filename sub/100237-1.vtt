Now reaching the right side of the colic.

04:38.119 --> 04:40.234
That looks pretty clean.

04:42.002 --> 04:46.364
An inferior ileocecal valve,
which is patent and looks fine.

05:15.687 --> 05:17.637
In a transverse colon.

05:17.637 --> 05:21.743
Wait a second,
that looks like a flat polyp there.

05:21.894 --> 05:23.988
Probably about 2 cm.

05:25.614 --> 05:28.256
Infix and biopsy for that.

05:28.332 --> 05:30.952
- Yussi, I'm a block away.

05:34.087 --> 05:35.572

Hey there, man?!

05:36.325 --> 05:37.958
- I got client, tell them to leave.
- Who the fuck do you think you are talking to?

05:38.055 --> 05:39.633
I don't think you said
they're friends of Arno’s.

05:39.633 --> 05:41.549
- Arno?! Tell 'em I’m coming up now.

05:41.893 --> 05:43.780
Bobby, I need that.

05:51.930 --> 05:56.310
30 inches, that's like about
35 carats in that.

06:01.569 --> 06:03.634
And bright in the middle gem...

06:04.335 --> 06:06.430
Yo, Howie!
What's poppin', man?

06:06.642 --> 06:09.103
That's my nigga Ca$h Out
I was telling you about.

06:09.198 --> 06:10.266
I'm gonna cash out.

06:10.266 --> 06:12.179
- How do you feel, all right?
- No, it was good.

06:12.179 --> 06:13.543
They are calling me
with the results.

06:13.543 --> 06:14.831
Hey, give him
some face time, man.

06:14.831 --> 06:16.022
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm good man.

06:16.022 --> 06:18.629
- Congratulations.
- Trying to spend some money with you.

06:18.629 --> 06:21.253
He took me from Flawless, man,
to come spend some money with you.

06:21.342 --> 06:22.665
He's telling me
you got the best prices.

06:22.665 --> 06:25.945
He’s doing you a favor, believe me,
that guy is a, fucking, moron.

06:25.945 --> 06:28.645
Yeah, Arno's friends here?
Yeah, I'm...

06:29.300 --> 06:32.181
Yussi told me you were waiting on me,
so I'm sorry about that.

06:32.181 --> 06:33.911
 - I'm Howard.
- Phil.

06:33.911 --> 06:35.608
You didn’t bring them any water?

06:35.608 --> 06:36.751
I'm good on the water.

06:36.916 --> 06:39.087
I don't really need water,
thank you anyway.

06:39.731 --> 06:42.268
This is our own spring water.

06:42.990 --> 06:45.294
We’re the first on the block
to have that.

06:46.316 --> 06:48.631
- Your parents happy for ya?
- Yeah, yeah.

06:48.975 --> 06:52.005
All right, so...
I'm gonna tell you I'm in a bit of a rush.

06:52.005 --> 06:54.042
I don’t have much time,
because I gotta get...

06:54.042 --> 06:56.484
What did I tell you?
I said no water.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.320
Didn’t I tell you no water?

06:58.331 --> 07:01.293
I think it’s in your best interest
that you find some time for you and I.

07:01.293 --> 07:02.171
Let me get here, a second.

07:02.171 --> 07:04.927
- All right, we’re on the same page, right?
- We are on the same page.

07:04.927 --> 07:07.219
- You all right, Howard?
- Oh yeah. 100% fine.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.219
Let's go, I'll handle it.
I'll handle it.

07:09.627 --> 07:11.767
You don't do that here, sir.

07:17.457 --> 07:18.915
Pick that door.

07:26.552 --> 07:28.263
Arno Maredian.

07:28.263 --> 07:29.481
- He's not available.
- Okay, all right.

07:29.481 --> 07:31.415
- He's not answering.
- He knows you are calling.

07:31.415 --> 07:32.824
He doesn't want
to deal with you anymore.

07:32.824 --> 07:35.233
- I understand, give me 1 more day.
- No, I don't think you do.

07:35.353 --> 07:38.013
Stop the fucking soap opera!
Listen, listen. Enough.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.145
What are we doing?
What the fuck is...

07:40.145 --> 07:41.678
Here we go again.
Stop fighting it.

07:41.678 --> 07:43.307
- It is not necessarily.
- No, it isn't?

07:43.307 --> 07:45.361
Well, we'll be the judges of it.

07:46.116 --> 07:48.742
- Literally, my last amount of cash I got.
- Fucking magician.

07:48.928 --> 07:51.345
- What about this? What's this?
- This is not mine.

07:51.345 --> 07:52.961
- But it's not mine.
- Take the fuck off.

07:52.961 --> 07:55.196
Take the, fucking, watch.
Take it. Take it.

07:57.468 --> 07:59.406
Arno Maredian.

07:59.990 --> 08:02.489
Arno, what the fuck is this shit?

08:02.489 --> 08:05.509
You're sending collectors
to fuck with me at my office?!

08:05.509 --> 08:07.675
Are you out of your, fucking, mind?

08:07.842 --> 08:11.893
I'm, literally, minutes away from
closing the biggest deal of my, goddamn, life.

08:11.893 --> 08:14.097
And when I do
you gonna be embarrassed.

08:15.244 --> 08:20.067
And by the way, the watch they took from me,
it's worth 20 000 dollars.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.441
I want that deducted
from the hundred grand, you understand?

08:23.441 --> 08:24.661
Call me back!

08:31.182 --> 08:33.635
What's up, ladies?

08:33.948 --> 08:36.205
- She's sleeping.
- She is sleeping?

08:51.103 --> 08:52.554
This is bullshit!

08:52.568 --> 08:54.229
- Hey Howie.
- Hey, Howard, how are you?

08:54.229 --> 08:55.838
People coming in and out
of the apartment.

08:55.838 --> 08:57.116
Oh my God, not this...

08:57.116 --> 08:59.085
You show up to work
anytime you, damn, please?

08:59.213 --> 09:01.540
- Howard I was working all night.
- I'm sick of this shit.

09:01.540 --> 09:04.438
- You're taking advantage of me.
- Howard. Oh my God.

09:04.438 --> 09:07.456
- Come on.
- It's 10:30. It's time to wake up.

09:07.623 --> 09:09.042
You're just so extra.

09:09.042 --> 09:11.605
- Did you have a party last night?
- I did not have a party.

09:11.605 --> 09:13.457
Did we have a party?
That was not a party...

09:13.457 --> 09:16.059
- Why didn't you call me?
- Okay, because I did call you.

09:16.186 --> 09:19.046
At around 9:30,
you said, "I'll call you back in 5".

09:19.046 --> 09:21.708
- I waited for hours.
- Yes, because I fell asleep.

09:21.986 --> 09:23.454
I was putting Beni to sleep.

09:23.940 --> 09:25.471
- Here we go with the lies.
- I had to put him to sleep.

09:25.471 --> 09:26.858
- I'm not lying!
- You're so manipulative!

09:26.858 --> 09:29.929
I had to fall asleep on the floor again!
I'm exhausted!

09:30.053 --> 09:32.969
I didn't ask you to have kids.
Not my fault you have kids.

09:32.969 --> 09:35.273
Shut the fuck up with that!

09:35.273 --> 09:38.509
Look, do you wanna, fucking, stay mad,
or do you wanna get in bed and cuddle?

09:38.709 --> 09:40.710
I know you wanna cuddle, Howard.
Just come here.

09:40.710 --> 09:42.824
- Come on.
- Come on. Just come here.

09:42.824 --> 09:45.293
Come here baby.
Come on, Howie.

09:45.426 --> 09:47.293
Come on.
I know you wanna come here.

09:47.293 --> 09:50.429
- I’m so goddamn stressed out.
- I know you can't resist me.

09:50.429 --> 09:52.429
I know you can't resist me.

09:55.408 --> 09:57.937
Don't, don't.
You can't just do that.

09:57.937 --> 10:00.044
It's just me.
It's me, it's me.

10:00.430 --> 10:02.153
Don’t you wanna
see the photos I took?

10:02.153 --> 10:04.486
Yes, yeah, show me.
What was that you...

10:04.751 --> 10:07.779
I took these pictures.
I think I really have a future in it.

10:07.849 --> 10:09.172
- How much did you get?
- 3 500.

10:09.172 --> 10:10.384
And who is this guy?

10:10.384 --> 10:12.028
It's this guy - <i>The Weeknd</i>.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.415
What the fuck is <i>The Weeknd</i> ?

10:13.415 --> 10:15.422
He's gonna be major,
even though he's from Canada.

10:15.422 --> 10:17.044
This guy looks stupid.

10:21.521 --> 10:22.531
Hi.

10:23.440 --> 10:25.236
Howard Ratner.
I'm all righty.

10:26.470 --> 10:29.253
I have a piece.
You know this kid - The Weeknd?

10:30.550 --> 10:32.316
That's Michael Jackson there on the cross.

10:32.316 --> 10:35.429
It's gonna be controversial piece,
makes it more valuable.

10:35.938 --> 10:38.204
The blacks are RS2, that's platinum.

10:38.276 --> 10:40.595
Turn around.
Don't even step in my place.

10:40.639 --> 10:41.582
Turn around.

10:41.582 --> 10:43.463
- I got some bets! 24 Gs.
- Don't even sit down!

10:43.463 --> 10:45.659
24 Gs?
Where would you get 24 Gs?

10:45.659 --> 10:49.085
I want the OKC/Lakers.
I want the fucking over, all right?

10:49.085 --> 10:50.773
I want Kobe's under.

10:50.841 --> 10:53.306
Kobe under?
He can’t throw it in the ocean.

10:53.416 --> 10:57.309
He's not scoring tonight.
I want the Sixers to cover.

10:57.309 --> 10:58.072
Plus 1.

10:58.072 --> 10:59.930
- The points are...
- Let's finish the bets here.

10:59.930 --> 11:01.394
Hey, one thing at a time!

11:01.539 --> 11:02.939
- I mean, come on!
- Hang on to these points.

11:03.056 --> 11:03.818
Demany. Demany.

11:03.818 --> 11:05.598
KG said he's gonna be here in a bit.

11:06.215 --> 11:09.017
If he gets to the store before I do,
you just fucking keep him there.

11:09.468 --> 11:10.986
Okay? You promise me?

11:12.751 --> 11:16.129
Kevin Garnett is coming to
my, fucking, show room right now.

11:16.261 --> 11:17.475
Right now!

11:19.382 --> 11:21.097
We hot every right
to, fucking, be here!

11:21.097 --> 11:23.243
- Get the fuck out!
- Fuck you!

11:24.162 --> 11:25.504
Whoah, whoah, whoah!

11:27.566 --> 11:29.817
Get out! Get the fuck out!

11:31.329 --> 11:32.966
- What?
- Fuck you man!

11:33.093 --> 11:35.087
You just got involved with something
you shouldn't got involved in.

11:35.087 --> 11:36.737
What the fuck
is going on out here?

11:36.737 --> 11:38.411
It's on you.
You asshole!

11:38.411 --> 11:40.900
- You see this?
- I don't know these fucking guys!

11:40.900 --> 11:42.900
You're dead fucker.
You're dead!

11:42.903 --> 11:44.240
You think I'm playing games?

11:44.240 --> 11:45.954
Get your laughs off now, asshole.

11:46.027 --> 11:47.231
I didn't do nothing!

11:47.231 --> 11:49.368
When I’m shoveling the dirt
over your fucking head,

11:49.368 --> 11:51.052
we’ll see how funny it is then!

11:51.142 --> 11:53.310
I have clients in the office, Howard.
This is crazy!

11:53.310 --> 11:54.323
Turn around and walk away!

11:54.323 --> 11:55.706
We're good.
We're good, all right?

11:55.706 --> 11:57.725
David, go back inside.
Everything's fine.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.163
Turn around and walk away!

11:59.163 --> 12:00.325
That's my shop.

12:00.325 --> 12:01.557
Everybody back in it.

12:01.557 --> 12:03.504
Hello, open the door.

12:04.013 --> 12:07.381
Okay, Jesus fucking...
Are you with KG?

12:10.947 --> 12:14.260
Okay, you gotta shut that door.
It's KG, huh?

12:15.063 --> 12:16.214
Is that closed?

12:17.289 --> 12:19.378
- That's my man!
- It's insane they just...

12:20.147 --> 12:21.215
Howard! Howard!

12:21.215 --> 12:22.716
What the fuck is going on, man?

12:22.882 --> 12:24.656
They tried to fuck Yussi up.

12:24.656 --> 12:25.483
It's all set.

12:25.483 --> 12:27.433
Look at his, fucking, shirt!
Look at his shirt.

12:27.433 --> 12:28.661
Okay.

12:29.589 --> 12:32.617
Listen, hey, thanks for the security,
by the way.

12:32.743 --> 12:36.834
Send those bitches back
to Paramus or Bay Ridge.

12:37.035 --> 12:38.939
Would you take that
and charge it up for me?

12:38.939 --> 12:41.752
All I got is, fucking,
Yussi to protect me.

12:44.160 --> 12:45.085
Let us talk.

12:45.594 --> 12:47.594
- What's going on, bro?
- What's up?

12:47.917 --> 12:50.265
Did a Maria, fucking,
time on the clock?

12:50.265 --> 12:51.581
Come on, not time
on the clock.

12:56.452 --> 12:58.013
- I like the earrings.
- Like these?

12:58.013 --> 12:59.515
- Those look great.
- Just come in to check on...

12:59.515 --> 13:01.480
- What was the last time you cleaned them?
- What are you talking about?

13:01.480 --> 13:03.327
- Let me clean these for you.
- He can clean them really quick.

13:03.327 --> 13:05.580
Let me throw them in the ultrasonic
for you, for free.

13:05.580 --> 13:07.457
- What this gonna cost me?
- For free.

13:07.457 --> 13:08.949
For free, for real?
Sure.

13:09.334 --> 13:11.334
I wouldn't think
you are that big on Roxon.

13:11.452 --> 13:13.158
That's 'cause you're big guy.

13:13.273 --> 13:14.668
Okay.

13:15.263 --> 13:17.698
Who would win in a fight:
Ben Wallace or Tony Allen?

13:19.039 --> 13:21.242
- Oh, shit, take a look at that shit.
- What is that?

13:22.330 --> 13:24.049
What is that, Gremlin?

13:24.049 --> 13:25.464
You got an iced-out Gremlin?

13:25.464 --> 13:27.831
This tardy motherfucker
right here is little fucking animal,

13:27.831 --> 13:30.083
or some kind of fucking...
Some toy and some shit...

13:30.083 --> 13:31.680
And it’ll just bling the bitch out!

13:31.965 --> 13:34.428
He used to work with niggas
on early music videos, all that shit.

13:34.560 --> 13:36.069
He's, like, the first
nigga to start all that.

13:36.069 --> 13:37.943
- Are you serious?
- I started this shit.

13:37.943 --> 13:39.464
- Show him the fucking eyes.
- I started...

13:39.824 --> 13:42.834
All right. So I did this.
So it fucks with you!

13:42.977 --> 13:44.759
- So it fucks with you!
- Are you serious?

13:44.759 --> 13:46.947
You like that?
There it is, there it is.

13:49.094 --> 13:51.961
That scares the shit out of people.
Look at that.

13:52.240 --> 13:53.680
Old, but It's dope.

13:53.714 --> 13:57.387
Listen. This shit was slammin'.

13:57.949 --> 14:00.510
What the link on that?
Let me see the chain on that.

14:00.510 --> 14:03.056
That's an 18.
But I can get you a 40.

14:03.507 --> 14:06.291
KG, Doc know
you’re here by the way?

14:06.291 --> 14:08.421
No, he doesn't.
And let's keep it that way.

14:08.421 --> 14:11.614
It's game night,
you should be stretching out.

14:11.776 --> 14:13.071
What is he, your coach?

14:13.071 --> 14:15.515
Nah, he’s just a crazy ass Jew.

14:16.960 --> 14:18.509
Throw these in the ultrasonic.

14:18.564 --> 14:20.592
Yes, boss, as soon as
the other stuff is done.

14:20.592 --> 14:21.614
No. Now!

14:22.137 --> 14:23.906
KG, I wouldn’t lean on that.

14:24.044 --> 14:26.711
Yo, Kevin was just telling me
he's looking for some watches.

14:26.711 --> 14:29.955
Are you looking for watches?
Let's go to a little wall of watches right there.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.610
- What are we talking? AP?
- I was thinking about...

14:32.736 --> 14:34.304
I was thinking about Presi though.

14:34.769 --> 14:36.421
One you got that crazy ass deal for?

14:36.421 --> 14:40.348
I want for 16.
Crazy one though, no?

14:40.491 --> 14:42.970
Yeah, the... It's insane.

14:44.592 --> 14:46.194
Look at this, there it is.

14:47.806 --> 14:50.622
That's a small watch
for a big man, I don't know.

14:52.988 --> 14:54.088
You got papers for this?

14:54.088 --> 14:57.145
- No, I don't have box and papers.
- Of course, I have fucking papers for that.

14:57.268 --> 14:59.146
I don’t have either one.
What are you talking about?

14:59.146 --> 15:01.981
- You sold me this shit, dummy.
- I don't remember that.

15:02.111 --> 15:03.947
Niggas calling niggas out for this, man.

15:04.169 --> 15:07.102
- Of course, if you don't have a box and pap...
- You find me one nigga...

15:07.102 --> 15:09.314
One nigga with a KMH watch
they called out?

15:09.543 --> 15:10.859
- I will wait.
- It's a moot point.

15:10.859 --> 15:13.303
Demany, because
I don't have these, all right?

15:13.389 --> 15:15.908
So how about we move onto
the diamonds here?

15:16.514 --> 15:19.690
You got a girl?
Why don't you get your girl a treat.

15:19.690 --> 15:21.420
He doesn't have a girlfriend.

15:21.420 --> 15:23.008
- Says who?
- Says you.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.143
How do you know
if I got a girlfriend or not?

15:26.143 --> 15:28.076
- What are you talking about?
- 'Cause you told me.

15:28.076 --> 15:29.735
- I never said that.
- Let's see what you got.

15:29.735 --> 15:30.898
- What the fuck are you doing?
- What? What's up?

15:31.071 --> 15:32.610
Why didn’t you bring
a, goddamn, watches?

15:32.610 --> 15:35.468
- I'm sorry, I'm not doing that.
- Nigga would've bought one!

15:35.592 --> 15:37.714
I told you, you can keep
them in my safe.

15:37.714 --> 15:40.444
I don't want you selling them
outta my showroom, you understand me?

15:40.551 --> 15:42.909
Fucking dumbass, where, the fuck,
am I gonna sell them, nigga?

15:42.909 --> 15:45.082
- On the, goddamn, street?
- That's not my problem, man.

15:45.082 --> 15:46.333
- Oh, that ain't your fucking problem?
- No.

15:46.457 --> 15:47.347
It ain't your fucking...

15:47.456 --> 15:49.554
- He doesn't like shit in this dusty motherfucking...
- Yes, he does.

15:49.665 --> 15:52.332
He's having a, fucking, ball here.
What are you talking about?

15:52.332 --> 15:54.966
What the fuck is he gonna buy?
The goddamn Furby, nigga?

15:57.325 --> 15:58.602
Fuck you, all right?

15:58.602 --> 16:00.232
I'm gonna take his ass
to, motherfucking, Flawless.

16:01.280 --> 16:03.906
- You're not taking him to Flawless.
- I'm taking him to Flawless.

16:04.612 --> 16:07.695
KG, do me a favor,
don't lean on that, please.

16:09.482 --> 16:11.420
Oh my God. Okay.

16:11.619 --> 16:13.420
Buzz him in!
Buzz him in now!

16:14.460 --> 16:16.611
Oh my God!
Is this...?

16:16.611 --> 16:18.937
This is it!

16:18.937 --> 16:19.952
- Hey.
- What's up?

16:19.952 --> 16:21.712
- Okay, look at this.
- I got a package from Fishtonic.

16:21.712 --> 16:23.266
- Where you want this?
- Bring it in. Bring it in.

16:23.266 --> 16:26.567
Go to my office.
KG, don't you dare leave, okay?

16:26.567 --> 16:29.328
What's in this package
is gonna blow your mind, KG.

16:29.743 --> 16:31.594
- Is it heavy?
- Yes.

16:31.594 --> 16:33.439
Yes! Yes!

16:33.487 --> 16:34.793
Oh my God!

16:37.039 --> 16:38.705
Fuck yeah!

16:39.488 --> 16:41.221
- For you.
- Give me that.

16:55.478 --> 16:57.301
Man, I can't do this anymore, bro!

16:57.337 --> 16:58.834
What happened?

16:59.023 --> 17:01.448
Your street goons in there,
they attacked me, man.

17:01.585 --> 17:03.331
What did you say
to piss them off?

17:03.331 --> 17:06.393
Listen, Garnett's crew came in here,
they took a look around.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.986
They see these guys, they like,
"Yo, who works here and who doesn't?".

17:08.986 --> 17:11.242
Who doesn't - get out.
I said these guys don't work here.

17:11.242 --> 17:13.226
That was stupid,
you shouldn't have said that.

17:13.226 --> 17:15.003
These guys grabbed me,
they dragged me over the collar.

17:15.003 --> 17:15.996
They ripped my shirt.

17:16.121 --> 17:17.974
- Okay, look, here. Take this shirt.
- They made me look like a fool over here.

17:17.974 --> 17:20.858
It's a Gucci shirt, it's $500,
it's brand-new.

17:20.858 --> 17:22.517
Are you fucking serious right now?

17:22.517 --> 17:24.377
- The tag is still on.
- It ain't about the shirt.

17:24.392 --> 17:26.288
You know what I'm saying,
I gave you 8 years of my life.

17:26.288 --> 17:28.252
Look how you treat me, man.
I...

17:28.252 --> 17:31.548
I put everything into this business,
I saved your ass a thousand times.

17:32.214 --> 17:36.320
I can't take this place anymore, man.
I can't deal with your problems every other day.

17:36.689 --> 17:40.132
Listen, there are a lot of people on this block
that would love to do business with me.

17:40.132 --> 17:44.664
When you gonna see me out there, working with them,
you not gonna like it, man, you gonna be jealous.

17:45.846 --> 17:48.049
You not gonna like it, Howard.

17:49.433 --> 17:51.047
Howard? Hello?

17:52.598 --> 17:54.634
I'm standing here, man.

17:55.326 --> 17:58.041
There are a lot of people I could be
doing business with other than you, Howard.

17:58.306 --> 18:00.648
You're falling apart,
you're looking like a fool out here

18:00.660 --> 18:01.961
on the diamond district.

18:02.118 --> 18:03.771
Looking through, fucking, fish?

18:04.551 --> 18:08.779
Come on, man, I gave you 8 years of my life,
and you can't even fucking talk to me

18:08.779 --> 18:10.581
and look me in the eyes?

18:10.581 --> 18:12.094
Man to fucking man?

18:12.226 --> 18:14.892
Holy shit, I'm gonna cum.

18:15.267 --> 18:17.923
Fuck you, man.
I'm finished with this shithole.

18:26.370 --> 18:28.776
KG! KG!

18:30.438 --> 18:33.057
- Howard, Yussi is gone, gone for good.
- That's fine with me.

18:33.057 --> 18:34.797
Let me get that phone.

18:34.797 --> 18:37.023
KG, you gotta come here, all right?

18:37.141 --> 18:38.959
- I gotta show you something.
- I gotta leave soon, man.

18:38.959 --> 18:40.914
- I know you have to leave, listen to me.
- I gotta get out of here.

18:40.915 --> 18:44.713
Okay, so I'm watching TV,
like a year ago, all right?

18:44.713 --> 18:48.324
I'm watching one of those, fucking,
history channel shows, trying to learn shit.

18:48.324 --> 18:51.388
And I stumbled...
You ever hear about African Jews?

18:51.388 --> 18:54.434
- African Jews?
- Yeah, no, all right, no.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.357
- Nigga wants everyone to be a Jew.
- Checks this out. Checks this out.

18:57.357 --> 18:58.329
All right?

18:58.329 --> 19:03.212
So, these are black Jews, all right?
They're stranded in the middle of Ethiopia.

19:03.299 --> 19:04.909
- It's deep shit.
- Stranded?

19:04.909 --> 19:08.855
Yeah, look, they got nothing.
They don't got cars, they don't got shit.

19:08.855 --> 19:10.803
And I'm watching this,
and I'm like - what the fuck

19:10.803 --> 19:12.381
are these guys wearing? Look.

19:12.381 --> 19:14.725
It's on the tower over there,
it's everywhere, right?

19:14.927 --> 19:15.899
What the fuck?

19:15.899 --> 19:19.407
Where are these, fucking, guys
get precious black opals?

19:19.407 --> 19:21.204
- That's what that is.
- It's black opal?

19:21.257 --> 19:23.720
I do my research,
these guys live near the Weio mines,

19:23.720 --> 19:26.913
which, primarily, red opals,
which aren't worth shit.

19:26.913 --> 19:27.831
- Okay?
- Oh, okay.

19:27.831 --> 19:31.678
But these, I can get your hands on
these things, you understand?

19:31.760 --> 19:32.758
- Really?
- So, look.

19:32.758 --> 19:35.418
I said to myself,
how do I get ahold of these guys?

19:35.418 --> 19:39.033
And I managed to track these guys down
and buy one from them.

19:39.125 --> 19:41.287
- Holy shit, what is that?
- What is that?

19:41.287 --> 19:43.523
That's what it is.
That's the rock.

19:43.523 --> 19:46.846
That's the rock.
That's the stone I got from them.

19:47.278 --> 19:48.833
How the fuck
did you get this shit, man?

19:48.833 --> 19:51.354
It took me, fucking, 17 months
to get this thing.

19:51.354 --> 19:52.876
- Holy shit.
- Just look at this.

19:52.876 --> 19:55.250
Hang on for a second.
Go through my loupe.

19:55.301 --> 19:57.539
- Be careful, that’s my best loupe.
- Let me see this, man.

19:57.577 --> 19:58.886
I want you to look...

19:58.886 --> 20:01.311
- You really into that motherfucker.
- Look at this.

20:02.612 --> 20:04.741
That's history, right there,
you understand?

20:04.741 --> 20:05.800
How many carats is this?

20:05.800 --> 20:09.667
What, four, five thousand carats?
3000 dollars for a carat, I don't know.

20:09.680 --> 20:11.141
- What?
- I'm not fucking bullshitting you.

20:11.224 --> 20:13.319
Why does it have so many
colors in it, man, what is this?

20:13.401 --> 20:16.533
That's the thing, they say you can see
the whole universe in opal.

20:16.533 --> 20:18.272
 That's how fucking old they are.

20:18.272 --> 20:20.067
- Holy shit.
- I've been telling you.

20:20.233 --> 20:22.419
- That's why I wanted you to see it.
- I gotta have one.

20:22.419 --> 20:24.122
You know, it's crazy, man.

20:24.122 --> 20:27.893
That's, fucking, from stone to stone.
Garnet's a stone, you know that.

20:28.138 --> 20:30.552
That's a million dollar opal
you are holding.

20:30.552 --> 20:36.472
Straight from the Ethiopian Jewish tribe.
I mean this is old school, middle earth shit.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.561
You got a, motherfuckin', dinosaur gem.

20:39.955 --> 20:43.288
That’s right. The dinosaurs were
fuckin' staring at this thing.

20:43.459 --> 20:48.246
It's 110 million years old, at least.
It's deep shit.

20:52.989 --> 20:54.190
KG, are you okay?

20:54.443 --> 20:56.302
- Are you all right?
- You gonna be all right?

20:56.454 --> 20:57.923
Told you not to lean.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.823
Give him a fucking towel or something.

21:00.042 --> 21:02.042
You heard me, I said
"tell them not to lean".

21:02.468 --> 21:03.822
Are you all right?

21:03.896 --> 21:05.566
That's a sign though.
That's a sign.

21:05.821 --> 21:08.410
That's a sign for that. I need this.
That what it is.

21:09.316 --> 21:11.004
Gotta make sure
my nigga good, bro.

21:11.004 --> 21:13.812
Fucking glass, I'm telling you.
It's a lot of weight you put on.

21:13.812 --> 21:16.253
That's the sign. I need this.
I need this gem.

21:16.253 --> 21:19.541
Listen, that's not for sale, I can't.
I can't sell it to you.

21:19.541 --> 21:21.935
- What do you mean it's not for sale?
- I can't do it.

21:22.818 --> 21:26.317
Goddamn, it's set per auction.
I can't...

21:26.317 --> 21:29.148
Why the fuck would you show me something,
if I couldn't have it then?

21:29.323 --> 21:31.172
Why the fuck would you
bring this out, you know?

21:31.172 --> 21:33.254
Sorry, I was excited.
Excited to share with you.

21:33.254 --> 21:36.512
Let me hold it for the night then.
Let me wear it to the game tonight, right?

21:36.734 --> 21:38.765
Would be cool, I'm going to the game,
nigga, I'll grab it from you,

21:38.765 --> 21:40.850
then meet you at Adley's
tomorrow morning, first thing.

21:41.256 --> 21:42.780
Cool, just like that.

21:43.940 --> 21:45.492
- Howard, come on.
- It's one night, Howard.

21:45.492 --> 21:46.800
- I can't.
- It's one night.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.813
- He's good for it.
- They'll pull it from the auction.

21:48.843 --> 21:52.574
You don't understand.
This stone, I'm really connecting with this.

21:52.820 --> 21:55.952
I feel like I’m gonna have
40 or 50 on this, man.

21:57.701 --> 21:59.455
You understand that?

21:59.455 --> 22:02.414
You see what I'm fucking talking about, Howard?
That shit is speaking to him, you know.

22:02.414 --> 22:04.309
I'm gonna destroy
Philly tonight with this.

22:04.309 --> 22:05.461
It's a spiritual man.

22:05.461 --> 22:08.925
Bitch ass nigga, this, fucking, thing
makes me feel like I can fly.

22:10.431 --> 22:13.845
So, you are going to
@MeAndHowie tag?

22:13.973 --> 22:16.404
- Yes. Yes, I got you.
- 30 fucking pics, I want likes.

22:17.113 --> 22:20.319
- Let me get a fucking shot.
- That's a good idea, man.

22:20.491 --> 22:24.485
Come here, so you're holding up?
Look at this shit.

22:24.624 --> 22:26.059
- Boom.
- Boom.

22:27.707 --> 22:30.126
I can't just...
Give me something as collateral.

22:30.126 --> 22:31.751
- I want the ring.
- Howard, calm the fuck down.

22:31.751 --> 22:34.126
- As collateral, I need to make sure he's bringing it back.
- No, no, he's good money, man.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.945
- I know he is, I want to make sure...
- That's a deal. That's a deal.

22:37.368 --> 22:38.821
- I'll give you that.
- Thanks.

22:38.971 --> 22:42.342
And I'm gonna keep it right here,
right next to my Knicks '73.

22:42.476 --> 22:44.027
- Classic.
- Classic, I like that.

22:44.038 --> 22:46.248
- I appreciate it.
- I got you.

22:47.052 --> 22:50.687
- Listen, you meet me!
- I'll meet your happy ass, yes.

22:50.687 --> 22:54.045
You will, fucking, bring that stone
to me, 9 in the morning.

22:54.045 --> 22:56.147
Hey, hey, listen to me.
No dicking around.

22:56.147 --> 22:57.485
You show up, you hear me?

22:57.485 --> 22:58.640
Chill.

22:58.640 --> 23:01.490
I'll see you there, motherfucker.
All right, let's roll out.

23:03.376 --> 23:04.703
Buzz ‘em out.

23:05.083 --> 23:06.118
I got his earrings.

23:06.190 --> 23:08.525
The earrings.
Wait, bring them out to him.

23:08.577 --> 23:10.595
Keep them, keep them to the mall,
I'll grab them.

23:11.370 --> 23:13.174
Black Jew empower, nigga!

23:17.243 --> 23:21.722
What the fuck...
Who's gonna clean this, fucking, shit?

23:22.446 --> 23:24.024
Eddie boy! What are you doing?

23:24.916 --> 23:25.991
What do you want, Dad?

23:25.991 --> 23:28.766
Look what I got,
look, you gonna love this.

23:28.997 --> 23:32.623
Here, what's that right there?
Would you leave me alone?

23:32.715 --> 23:34.887
- What is this?
- It's Kevin Garnett’s ring.

23:34.887 --> 23:38.417
Championship ring.
NBA, 2008, I knew you'd freak out.

23:38.417 --> 23:39.398
Sick!

23:39.398 --> 23:41.781
All right, I love you, my boy.

23:45.939 --> 23:48.728
Roberto, came to work.

23:51.245 --> 23:53.239
- Bronstein.
- Hey, Howard.

23:53.239 --> 23:56.109
Hey, break out your tray.
Where is it? Where is it?

23:56.275 --> 23:58.548
I'd shake your hand,
but I know where it's been.

23:58.548 --> 24:02.853
Look at this, that’s Kevin Garnett’s
2008 championship ring.

24:02.853 --> 24:05.818
- Championship ring?
- Championship ring, 2008.

24:05.818 --> 24:07.544
All right, you wanna pawn it
or you wanna sell it?

24:07.544 --> 24:08.931
I wanna pawn it.

24:08.931 --> 24:10.822
- Let me take a quick look at it.
- Right, okay.

24:10.822 --> 24:12.001
I don't know
what you are looking for.

24:12.001 --> 24:14.026
- Check the diamond.
- That was just on his fucking finger.

24:14.026 --> 24:17.019
It's single cut, you know, Howie.
It's single cut, it's not even a full cut.

24:17.019 --> 24:19.572
Okay, you talk to the fucking League
about the way the cut this shit.

24:19.743 --> 24:22.350
- They worth less.
- Take a look at this, all right?

24:22.545 --> 24:23.939
All right, it's his ring, I understand.

24:23.939 --> 24:26.099
It's from his Instagram,
it's, fucking, blowing up right now?

24:26.099 --> 24:28.065
I hear you, all right.
So, what do you need for it?

24:28.065 --> 24:31.194
I figured, that thing's worth 80 grand?

24:31.501 --> 24:34.863
Just loan it to me, that's it.
Just loan it to me, I'll be back Friday.

24:34.863 --> 24:36.673
Number one - we both know what's in here.

24:36.673 --> 24:39.442
We both know that the value
is mostly cause of memorabilia.

24:39.525 --> 24:41.173
- But it is a memorabilia piece.
- Yes.

24:41.173 --> 24:44.192
- So that’s why you’d be able to sell it.
- So I'll tell you what.

24:44.844 --> 24:46.840
Give me 50 Gs.
Just float it for me.

24:46.840 --> 24:50.524
I'm gonna give you 25 thousand dollars,
but I want an 8 % vig on the ring.

24:50.524 --> 24:54.416
8 %? Fucking, how about I give you a grand,
you take a grand off the top.

24:54.416 --> 24:55.932
I'm gonna come back Friday for it.

24:55.932 --> 24:57.751
You know last time you left
something here for 6 months.

24:57.751 --> 24:58.897
So we wanna make sure upfront.

24:58.897 --> 25:01.694
Last time wasn’t my fault,
we fucking went over that.

25:01.694 --> 25:03.452
I understand, let's make it quick.

25:03.452 --> 25:06.981
21 thousand dollars, 7 % vig.
And I want you to know.

25:07.038 --> 25:09.787
Say, you'll be back Friday,
if you're not back Friday, it's my ring.

25:09.787 --> 25:12.116
If I don't bring it back Friday,
I'm a dead man, so...

25:12.116 --> 25:14.638
- All right, so we have a deal?
- All right, deal.

25:14.638 --> 25:16.523
- Mazel.
- Mazel.

25:17.082 --> 25:20.813
- Can you go to the stake and get me the money?
- Get him the money, we'll get you the money.

25:20.813 --> 25:24.674
Hey, good Pesach.
This is great.

25:26.667 --> 25:30.300
70th and 1st?
The fuck is he doing there?

25:30.300 --> 25:31.683
Just walking.

25:32.598 --> 25:34.822
Now he's stopping, he's slowing down.

25:37.914 --> 25:39.192
Why?

25:39.192 --> 25:41.803
He's doing something.
He's playing with his phone or something.

25:41.803 --> 25:44.061
He's playing with something.
I can't make it out.

25:44.061 --> 25:46.988
- I can't see him, his back is to me.
- He’s hunched over. You can’t see.

25:46.988 --> 25:49.477
I don't know. We can't see anything.

25:49.851 --> 25:52.225
Here we go, see.
Here we go, he's going again.

25:52.225 --> 25:55.322
- Wait, I just got a text from him.
- What's he saying?

25:55.496 --> 25:57.987
- It's a picture of money.
- This fucking prick.

25:57.987 --> 25:59.768
- It says, "Arno...
- He's got fucking money.

25:59.768 --> 26:01.905
I got your money right here".

26:01.905 --> 26:04.665
- He’s turning into somewhere.
- A restaurant, Nino’s.

26:05.444 --> 26:07.219
Hey, handsome, where is he at?

26:07.219 --> 26:08.996
He's in the back.

26:14.929 --> 26:17.377
Hey, you gonna make me palls in the back?

26:18.507 --> 26:22.527
- Gary, Gary.
- ... you have your eggs no carrots in the Citazel.

26:22.527 --> 26:23.939
- Listen to me.
- What do you want?

26:23.939 --> 26:26.194
- I already made your bet.
- I know, I gotta change it.

26:26.194 --> 26:29.478
I got 21 thousand dollars.
You add it onto the nineteen.

26:29.478 --> 26:30.874
40 thousand dollars.

26:30.874 --> 26:32.253
- Scrap the whole bet?
- Scrap the whole.

26:32.253 --> 26:36.115
I wanna make a six-way parlay.
Celtics Sixers game, what's the line-up?

26:36.115 --> 26:37.308
- Still plus one.
- Plus one, okay.

26:37.308 --> 26:40.224
So, I want the Celtics to cover.
I want the Celtics halftime.

26:40.224 --> 26:43.788
I want Garnett's points and rebounds.
Garnett's block shots.

26:43.812 --> 26:46.565
Celtics opening tip,
you take lightening bets?

26:46.565 --> 26:48.691
Yeah, but you don't want
any part in lightening bets, come on.

26:48.691 --> 26:50.882
A thousand dollars a point, okay?
Take this.

26:50.882 --> 26:53.060
- And this is the gift from me.
- What's this?

26:53.060 --> 26:55.377
Just for tolerating me
for all this time, okay?

26:55.768 --> 26:58.116
No, I already have a Rolex,
I don't need your watch.

26:58.237 --> 27:00.700
It probably fell off a truck anyway.
But listen, what do you know?

27:00.700 --> 27:02.571
Garnett this, Garnett that,
what do you know?

27:02.571 --> 27:04.541
- I don't know, I just know.
- I'll tell you what I know.

27:04.541 --> 27:07.177
It's the dumbest, fucking, bet
I've ever heard of.

27:07.468 --> 27:09.194
I disagree.

27:09.893 --> 27:11.813
I disagree, Gary.

27:12.379 --> 27:14.315
Let him shoot.

27:17.401 --> 27:18.678
Fuck!

27:20.679 --> 27:23.880
Fucking, those 5, fucking, steps into the...

27:25.656 --> 27:29.110
Jesus Christ! That's it.

27:29.782 --> 27:32.137
Tap to the KG.
That’s it. That’s it.

27:35.246 --> 27:37.246
Back him down.

27:37.909 --> 27:40.230
Fuck you! Yes!
That's it!

27:40.534 --> 27:43.149
That's it. That's my man!

27:44.401 --> 27:47.664
Let's go, get up on him.
Get up on him.

27:47.950 --> 27:51.359
Fucking, get the fuck up on him,
goddamn it!

27:51.694 --> 27:54.706
Howard, what are you doing?
What are you doing? Howard?

27:54.706 --> 27:57.537
- Beni is waiting for you
- Okay, I'm coming up.

27:57.565 --> 27:59.998
It's 25 minutes past his bedtime. Go.

28:00.119 --> 28:01.529
Did he brush his teeth yet?

28:01.529 --> 28:04.406
Brush his teeth?!
I sent you 7 texts in the dark.

28:05.540 --> 28:08.314
Howard, it's the first quarter.

28:08.920 --> 28:14.114
That guy was in my shop earlier today.
Look at him. Soft touch.

28:14.114 --> 28:15.970
He can fucking shoot...
- I don't care, Howard.

28:15.970 --> 28:18.028
Howard, go say goodnight to your son.

28:19.430 --> 28:20.837
Okay, I'll be right there.

28:22.274 --> 28:23.893
I'll be right there.

28:24.782 --> 28:26.737
Let me just get to the time-out.

28:26.737 --> 28:28.856
This, fucking, wrath is ridiculous.

28:28.856 --> 28:31.594
- Now!
- All right, I'm sorry.

28:38.506 --> 28:41.998
Rondo with 9 on the shot clock,
only now to 3 minutes to go.

28:43.008 --> 28:49.513
Garnett put it up with 4 on the shoot.
Garnett, vintage game one, for sure.

28:49.513 --> 28:52.311
15 points on 7 for 8 from the field.

28:52.532 --> 28:54.441
Oh, no!

28:56.455 --> 28:58.562
Oh, give me a fucking break.

28:58.562 --> 29:01.512
Fuck you Callahan! You cocksucker.

29:11.603 --> 29:14.283
- Hey, hey, right?
- Garnett's killing it right now.

29:14.492 --> 29:16.375
I know, Beni's sleeping.
Keep it down.

29:16.375 --> 29:17.667
I'm sorry. I'm so hyped.

29:17.667 --> 29:21.591
NBA is always the last 2,
fucking, minutes, so let's calm down.

29:21.947 --> 29:23.261
Hit that KG!

29:23.261 --> 29:24.438
- Dad, I bet money.
- Boom!

29:24.438 --> 29:26.277
Jason bet me 25 bucks
for the first half.

29:26.277 --> 29:28.399
Doubled that up the last half,
for another fifty bucks!

29:28.399 --> 29:30.636
Your father bet a lot
of money on this, son.

29:30.636 --> 29:32.748
Really? How much?

29:32.892 --> 29:35.043
- You don't wanna know.
- A lot though, right?

29:36.656 --> 29:40.308
Put that shit in the fucking hole!
That's right, come on, you can dunk again!

29:44.360 --> 29:46.756
Amazing, this is amazing.

29:47.904 --> 29:50.867
He’s down.
He's asleep.

30:05.778 --> 30:08.776
You flip it to ESPN,
just for one second.

30:10.133 --> 30:13.401
This is a huge game,
That's why he's going so crazy up there.

30:13.401 --> 30:17.601
I’m tempted to wrangle the kids downstairs
right now and get it over with.

30:18.176 --> 30:22.383
You really wanna do that?
I don't know how sensitive that is.

30:22.383 --> 30:23.935
You're calling me insensitive?

30:23.935 --> 30:27.248
I thought we both agreed
that we wait till after Passover.

30:27.248 --> 30:29.642
Next you’ll be saying you wanna
wait until after the summer.

30:29.969 --> 30:32.556
I’m not opposed to waiting
till after summer.

30:33.383 --> 30:37.352
It's commercial, can't you just put the game on
for two, fucking, minutes?

30:37.596 --> 30:39.751
Till my car gets here?

30:44.431 --> 30:48.756
Let's not chop the body.
No words to describe that.

30:51.678 --> 30:55.787
41? I don't know how old these guys are,
but you can't tell by their age.

31:02.611 --> 31:03.982
This is crazy.

31:03.982 --> 31:07.252
Here is KG hitting the shot from outside.
He’ll be 36 on Saturday.

31:07.252 --> 31:11.976
And he puts the Celtics
over the century mark, 101 to 76!

31:13.501 --> 31:16.956
Oh, yes!

31:17.491 --> 31:19.381
Oh, God. Yes!

31:19.381 --> 31:20.544
Oh, fuck!

31:20.544 --> 31:26.171
Oh my God!

31:28.738 --> 31:30.924
- Hey, change of plans.
- What's up?

31:32.372 --> 31:36.097
Take the exit, 49th street and 3rd avenue,
Smith and Wollensky.

31:36.102 --> 31:39.655
- Everything okay?
- I just... What's your name?

31:39.905 --> 31:41.358
Devis.

31:41.358 --> 31:45.657
I just hit very big, very big.
Oh my God!

31:52.501 --> 31:54.501
KG havin’ fun...

31:59.198 --> 32:00.884
Jules?

32:07.702 --> 32:09.224
Hey?

32:31.614 --> 32:34.657
- Hey, what's up?
- Baby, where are you at?

32:35.241 --> 32:38.164
I’m just going back right now,
in the elevator. Why, what's up?

32:38.164 --> 32:40.921
I got held up,
I'm just on my way back now.

32:40.921 --> 32:43.439
Dinah was on the tear tonight.

32:44.002 --> 32:46.505
That sucks, how far away are you?

32:47.843 --> 32:50.998
I'm in the tunnel,
just getting in there.

32:51.531 --> 32:54.292
- Okay, so you're very close.
- Yes.

32:54.448 --> 32:55.755
Hold on, I gotta go.
I gotta go.

32:55.755 --> 32:57.166
Wait, wait.

32:57.166 --> 32:58.718
- Hey.
- What?

32:58.718 --> 33:01.679
I can't wait to see you.
I'm in an incredible mood.

33:01.679 --> 33:03.267
Okay, I got another line,
I got another line.

33:03.267 --> 33:05.193
- Gotta go, bye.
- Okay.

33:25.761 --> 33:28.307
As we speak, yeah, and I still
have to set up the stakes.

33:28.307 --> 33:29.911
I still have to get ready.

33:29.911 --> 33:34.225
Because his gem came, do you not listen to me?
I've been talking about it all day.

33:35.904 --> 33:38.713
I'm gonna...
Remember the green? The photo I have?

33:40.082 --> 33:41.694
Yeah, I know, I know...

35:29.485 --> 35:31.621
I'm gonna cum!

35:31.621 --> 35:33.133
I can't help it.
I can't...

35:33.133 --> 35:34.768
Oh my God!

35:35.166 --> 35:36.919
Why the fuck did you do that?

35:36.919 --> 35:40.668
You see how fucking sweet you look,
you look so gorgeous.

35:40.668 --> 35:43.113
I just hit so, fucking, big.

35:43.113 --> 35:45.402
- I hit so big.
- How big?

35:46.498 --> 35:48.726
Feel how wet I am.

36:03.948 --> 36:05.708
I'm almost there.

36:05.878 --> 36:07.895
What?
You told me that already.

36:07.895 --> 36:09.484
Yeah, I hit the mad traffic.

36:09.484 --> 36:12.341
What are you talking...
9 o'clock we were supposed to be there.

36:12.383 --> 36:14.890
- It's fucking 9:43
- Look, the whole city is clogged up.

36:14.890 --> 36:16.083
I can't do anything about it.

36:16.083 --> 36:19.760
Not everybody's on
"Demany-time", man, let's move!

36:25.452 --> 36:28.305
Okay, you can tell Anne we're here.

36:28.398 --> 36:30.360
I'm sorry, hold on one second.
Hi.

36:30.914 --> 36:33.238
Anne Debaugh,
Howard Ratner and his partner.

36:33.402 --> 36:34.812
We're all ready to go.

36:34.812 --> 36:38.150
Okay, when your partner gets here
I will let her know that you're here.

36:38.150 --> 36:40.314
- Thanks.
- You can sit over there if you'd like.

36:41.669 --> 36:42.643
Yes?

36:42.643 --> 36:44.718
Hello, Howard,
I'm pulling up right now, come out.

36:45.044 --> 36:47.552
- I said I'm inside.
- I'm not going find a parking here.

36:47.552 --> 36:49.831
- Double-park the car.
- No, I'm not getting no fucking ticket...

36:49.831 --> 36:51.658
- Do it.
- For you or nobody else.

36:51.658 --> 36:53.649
- What the...?
- Meet me, we'll talk to you.

36:54.052 --> 36:55.254
Are you fucking kidding me?

36:55.254 --> 36:57.732
No, I'm not fucking kidding you,
I'm pulling up, come on.

37:00.096 --> 37:01.993
- Will be right back.
- Okay.

37:03.032 --> 37:05.330
Fuck!

37:11.520 --> 37:13.104
Howard, Howard!

37:13.104 --> 37:15.372
Jesus, how did you find me?

37:15.372 --> 37:17.159
- Your office told me where you are.
- You're following me?

37:17.159 --> 37:19.056
- Yeah, we need the money today.
- My office would never tell you that.

37:19.056 --> 37:20.702
- This is the last straw.
- Get out of here.

37:20.702 --> 37:23.985
You haven’t been returning my phone calls or texts.
You can’t take ten minutes to...

37:23.985 --> 37:25.731
What, you're bringing
your, fucking, heavy with you?

37:25.731 --> 37:27.732
- Yeah. You got my money?
- You want money?

37:27.732 --> 37:29.470
- Yeah, you owe me 32 grand.
- I've got no, fucking, money.

37:29.470 --> 37:32.035
Fine, fine.
Look, that's 30 grand.

37:32.035 --> 37:33.960
Fucking sell that for 15 Gs.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.491
15 Gs, where?
Where I'm gonna sell this?

37:35.491 --> 37:39.662
Go to Wempe’s, 55th and 5th avenue.
Go there, put that in your, fucking, pocket.

37:39.662 --> 37:41.296
Hey, hey.
Where is it at?

37:41.641 --> 37:43.255
Where's the gem?

37:43.255 --> 37:44.514
You give me the gem.
I'll run it up to Siz.

37:44.837 --> 37:46.783
- Get in, I need to talk to you.
- I don't know anything about the watch.

37:46.783 --> 37:48.610
Hey, get the fuck out of here.
I don't want a watch.

37:48.610 --> 37:50.369
You just gave it to me,
for the money you owe me.

37:50.369 --> 37:51.501
- Shut the fuck up,
- This is half the money.

37:51.501 --> 37:53.445
I'm not, fucking, buying
watches right now.

37:53.445 --> 37:54.674
- Back the fuck up.
- Take shit.

37:54.674 --> 37:58.251
- Don't touch my shit.
- Walk the fuck away, man.

37:58.251 --> 37:59.040
Come on, give me the opal.

37:59.040 --> 38:01.107
- Get in, nigga, just want to talk to you.
- They are waiting on us!

38:01.107 --> 38:04.444
- Get in, we'll talk, man.
- What do I getting in, fucking, car for?

38:04.498 --> 38:05.654
Jesus Christ!

38:05.654 --> 38:08.789
Get out of here
with that, fucking, Fugazi shit!

38:11.222 --> 38:14.355
Why am I in your car right now?
They are, fucking, waiting on us.

38:14.355 --> 38:15.156
Where is the opal?

38:15.156 --> 38:18.566
We’re at the, fucking, hotel, getting ready to go,
about to go party, we got 3 bad bitches.

38:18.566 --> 38:20.326
I don't have time for this.
Where is my opal?

38:20.326 --> 38:22.455
And KG leaves his,
fucking, ID upstairs, so...

38:22.455 --> 38:25.311
Demany, we don't have time!
They are waiting for us!

38:25.460 --> 38:27.634
- Where is the fucking opal?
- Garnett’s got it.

38:27.927 --> 38:30.538
Garnett’s got it?
That guy fucked us.

38:30.538 --> 38:32.125
I don't know what the fuck
you want me to do about that.

38:32.125 --> 38:34.255
Call him up. Call him on the phone.
Let me talk to him.

38:34.255 --> 38:36.391
I can't, fucking, call him
right now, he's at practice.

38:36.391 --> 38:38.707
- Tell him I'll give him another opal for free.
- Howard, listen to me.

38:38.707 --> 38:41.702
- I can't call him because he is at practice.
- To wear for as long as he wants.

38:41.702 --> 38:44.463
My nigga, he's not gonna answer
his, fucking, phone for me, God, or anybody else.

38:44.463 --> 38:46.391
Fine, then we'll go on the practice.

38:46.391 --> 38:47.306
What?

38:47.306 --> 38:49.216
So, you want me to go
to, fucking, Philly right now?

38:49.216 --> 38:51.358
He's in Philly?
Then, we're going to Philly.

38:51.358 --> 38:53.139
I just got back from Philly, man.
I'm not driving...

38:53.139 --> 38:56.053
It's 2 fucking hours to get there.
Come on, come on.

38:59.592 --> 39:02.487
Fuck this!
Let's drive!

39:04.363 --> 39:06.158
We gotta be in and out.
In and out.

39:06.158 --> 39:07.912
I got my daughter's play tonight.

39:08.639 --> 39:11.214
How's that? Is that KG?
Tell him we're here, we're coming in.

39:11.222 --> 39:13.339
You gotta calm,
your happy ass, down.

39:13.479 --> 39:16.151
Are we going inside the facility,
or we gonna meet him out here?

39:16.151 --> 39:17.445
Just chill the fuck out!

39:17.445 --> 39:18.600
I hope we'll see Rondo in there.

39:18.600 --> 39:21.001
I'd love to tell him thank you
for trapping all those dimes.

39:21.001 --> 39:22.595
Man, no, that's not...
They're busy.

39:22.595 --> 39:25.890
And what the fuck is this with you
Jewish niggas and basketball anyway?

39:26.643 --> 39:30.937
I’ll have you know the first two points
scored in the NBA was a Jew.

39:30.937 --> 39:33.597
- Yeah, What? Fred Flinstein?
- No?

39:33.597 --> 39:37.329
Ozzie Sheckman. 1946.
Played for the Knicks.

39:37.329 --> 39:40.566
Here we go!
This is where the big boys play.

39:42.062 --> 39:44.794
They always got to practice.

39:44.794 --> 39:46.301
Look at this!
This is sick.

39:46.301 --> 39:47.882
Sick, my God!

39:47.882 --> 39:50.160
Hey, check this out.

39:57.699 --> 39:59.925
And he scores.

40:00.805 --> 40:02.734
- Hey, I need to get through.
- Sorry.

40:05.777 --> 40:07.101
Demany!

40:09.400 --> 40:11.631
What's up?
I'm with him.

40:12.194 --> 40:13.607
No, no. I'm with him.
Demany.

40:13.979 --> 40:15.024
What the fuck?

40:15.277 --> 40:16.223
Excuse me.

40:16.223 --> 40:17.423
What's he fucking...

40:17.881 --> 40:19.535
I'm with him,
I came with him.

40:19.755 --> 40:20.878
You saw me
walked through the door.

40:20.878 --> 40:22.065
No, I didn't see
you walk through the door.

40:22.065 --> 40:24.660
- What's your name?
- I won't be on the list, 'cause I came with him.

40:24.660 --> 40:26.390
I came with him.

40:26.487 --> 40:28.272
What, the fuck, is he doing to me?

40:28.272 --> 40:30.272
Cocksucking fucker works for me!

40:30.500 --> 40:32.047
Is Marcel excited?

40:32.954 --> 40:34.812
Yeah, I think she's a little nervous.

40:39.235 --> 40:42.805
- And Danny's got a role too.
- Small part, he's nervous, but.

40:42.805 --> 40:45.060
- Good.
- Nothing phases him.

40:45.214 --> 40:46.947
He said she was amazing.

40:48.637 --> 40:50.519
What are you guys doing
for the break?

40:52.249 --> 40:54.404
We're not doing anything this year.

40:54.685 --> 40:56.470
- Oh, really?
- Wow.

40:56.569 --> 40:58.013
That's not like you, guys.

40:58.013 --> 40:59.867
How come?
Howard, how come?

40:59.867 --> 41:01.530
- Howard?
- Everything okay?

41:01.530 --> 41:02.981
Howard?

41:04.638 --> 41:05.785
No vacation?

41:05.785 --> 41:09.424
No, next year we're gonna
take a big trip,

41:09.424 --> 41:11.466
saving up for that,
gonna go to Europe.

41:11.466 --> 41:13.950
- That's nice.
- So, yeah...

41:13.950 --> 41:17.102
Do a little culture.
These kids are becoming morons.

41:18.156 --> 41:20.838
- Oh, yeah.
- We'll be morons in Concun.

41:21.114 --> 41:23.200
Right, especially on the trapeze.

41:23.380 --> 41:25.832
Good luck to Danny tonight.
When is he coming?

41:25.851 --> 41:27.754
We just talked about Danny.

41:28.734 --> 41:31.419
What are you gonna do for Passover?
Is your sister coming?

41:31.419 --> 41:32.244
Yeah.

41:32.244 --> 41:33.526
What are you doing?
What do you got?

41:33.526 --> 41:36.975
Watching through a phone.
I got six different players, in six different games.

41:37.528 --> 41:39.102
We’re all making sacrifices.

41:39.102 --> 41:41.471
Hey, who tapped me.
Who was that?

41:51.620 --> 41:54.064
But that'll be nice.
You gonna do the questions?

41:54.722 --> 41:56.256
Yeah, you were practicing?

41:56.266 --> 41:57.996
I've been practicing.

41:57.996 --> 42:00.159
I don't know how are we
gonna fit it in Mexico.

42:03.798 --> 42:05.664
Good luck to Marcel.

42:05.664 --> 42:07.739
I know, and to Danny.

42:08.465 --> 42:09.437
Where are you going?

42:09.437 --> 42:11.419
Daddy's gonna go to bathroom.
I'll be right back.

42:12.130 --> 42:13.616
I'll be back, thank you.

42:13.756 --> 42:15.965
Howard, Marcel is about
to get on the stage.

42:15.981 --> 42:18.656
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Howard, are you okay?

42:24.011 --> 42:25.456
This is fucked up guys?

42:25.456 --> 42:27.008
What is so fucked up about it?

42:28.959 --> 42:31.913
- May I speak to you, guys, outside?
- You sure you wanna do that?

42:31.913 --> 42:33.484
Yeah? All right.

42:33.913 --> 42:35.061
Excuse me.

42:39.862 --> 42:43.384
Howard, hey.
What are we gonna do here, man?

42:44.285 --> 42:45.270
Come on, man.

42:45.402 --> 42:47.579
That's my family!

42:47.826 --> 42:49.090
Get the fuck off me!

42:51.749 --> 42:52.947
I got you!

42:56.927 --> 42:59.595
Hey, I'm a cop.
That looks great.

43:04.932 --> 43:06.790
Are you kidding me?
How good you guys look.

43:06.790 --> 43:08.271
Dad, what are you doing?

43:08.271 --> 43:10.838
Marcel, break a leg,
we’re all here for you!

43:25.059 --> 43:26.226
Fuck!

43:41.867 --> 43:43.741
- Get him, get him!
- Fuck!

43:45.392 --> 43:46.605
Fucking shit!

43:48.478 --> 43:49.587
Come here, you motherfucker!

43:49.587 --> 43:51.908
Hey, fuck you, fuck you!

43:56.421 --> 43:58.219
Come on, get up!

44:00.237 --> 44:01.738
Come on.

44:02.191 --> 44:03.885
I'm coming.

44:04.469 --> 44:06.326
What the fuck!
You, fucking, bit me?!

44:08.249 --> 44:09.635
Arno!

44:10.428 --> 44:12.803
- Get him the in the car!
- Arno!

44:13.599 --> 44:15.010
What the fuck?

44:15.623 --> 44:17.856
Go, go, go.
Come on, let's get out of here.

44:17.856 --> 44:21.811
You, fucking, bit me!
I'll kill you, you hear me?

44:22.202 --> 44:24.010
Arno. What is happening?

44:24.010 --> 44:26.263
Don't Arno me,
don't, fucking, state my name.

44:26.808 --> 44:27.825
Give me the keys.

44:27.825 --> 44:29.698
The, fucking, Jew bit me.

44:29.698 --> 44:32.340
Hey, what's happening right now?

44:32.494 --> 44:35.232
I told you how things are gonna go,
if you didn't start to behave.

44:35.232 --> 44:38.833
What? How was I not behaving?
Explain to me, I'm sorry.

44:38.833 --> 44:42.546
I think I was very explicit on the phone
about how things are gonna go.

44:42.642 --> 44:44.601
You like the way
things are going now?

44:44.601 --> 44:46.379
Give me the, fucking, keys
to your car, man!

44:46.379 --> 44:48.992
What are you gonna do?
Have them steal my Mercedes?

44:49.207 --> 44:51.428
Look what, the fuck, you did,
you, fucking, bit me.

44:52.007 --> 44:53.563
Arno. Fucking talk to me.

44:53.563 --> 44:55.911
Don't listen to him, Arno,
that's not a game.

44:55.911 --> 44:57.392
- Arno.
- Don't say my, fucking, name!

44:57.903 --> 45:00.662
I have every intention
of paying you back.

45:00.779 --> 45:02.162
I'm broke right now.

45:02.162 --> 45:03.525
You're broke?
What's that one?

45:03.525 --> 45:05.847
Look at that, do you remember that?
Look at it!

45:05.940 --> 45:08.821
That is money, that's not mine.

45:08.958 --> 45:12.261
That I sent to you
because I wanted to calm you down.

45:12.261 --> 45:15.224
We know for a fact,
that you placed a bet with that money.

45:15.499 --> 45:18.188
- I never placed a bet with that money.
- Yes, you did.

45:18.390 --> 45:19.953
- No, I didn't.
- No, let me ask you something.

45:19.953 --> 45:22.311
I heard that Beni and Eddie
are going to Timberlake.

45:22.311 --> 45:25.455
And you know what else I heard?
I heard you've resurfaced your, fucking, swimming pool.

45:25.976 --> 45:27.148
You know how that makes me feel?

45:27.148 --> 45:29.342
- I've never resurfaced anything.
- You think your life is more important than mine?

45:29.342 --> 45:32.577
- I don't know who said that.
- Give me the keys and shut the fuck up!

45:32.720 --> 45:34.337
Give me the keys to your, fucking, car!

45:34.337 --> 45:36.986
I'll give you, fucking, keys, fine.

45:37.826 --> 45:40.333
All right, listen.
I do. I did.

45:40.467 --> 45:42.330
I admit it, I...

45:42.330 --> 45:45.457
I made a bet.
And guess what?

45:46.232 --> 45:47.675
Here's the thing. I hit.

45:47.847 --> 45:50.353
I hit the bet big, okay?

45:50.353 --> 45:51.844
You think I'm stupid?

45:52.126 --> 45:54.958
You think I'm stupid, Howard.
You and your whole, fucking, family.

45:55.095 --> 45:58.254
I'll call the book right now,
you'll get on the phone, and he'll tell you.

45:58.254 --> 46:00.985
I saw your bookie,
you are talking about Gary?

46:00.985 --> 46:03.264
You spoke to Gary?
About what?

46:03.264 --> 46:07.323
About you. About how you're taking my money.
All of the time and placing bets.

46:07.323 --> 46:08.928
You know what that does to me?

46:08.928 --> 46:11.032
You know how offensive it is to me?

46:11.287 --> 46:13.446
What? You stopped the bet?

46:14.404 --> 46:15.613
What do you think, asshole?

46:15.613 --> 46:17.613
- You stopped the bet?
- Shut the fuck up!

46:19.671 --> 46:24.018
Congratulations, Arno, you,
fucked, ourselves out of six hundred...

46:26.085 --> 46:27.822
Take his clothes off.

46:30.147 --> 46:31.731
What's this?

46:31.731 --> 46:33.752
Give me your, fucking, shirt!

46:33.752 --> 46:35.541
This worth more than my, fucking, car.

46:36.886 --> 46:38.376
Howard, you did this to yourself.

46:38.376 --> 46:39.158
Take his fucking shoes.

46:39.158 --> 46:40.676
I will get you the money.

46:43.745 --> 46:47.252
I'll get the money for you.
I got the...

46:47.416 --> 46:49.946
... rip me off
to this next fucking week...

46:49.946 --> 46:52.380
Give me my glasses.
I need my, fucking, glasses.

46:52.380 --> 46:53.853
Shut the fuck up!

46:54.870 --> 46:56.682
Pull up right here.
Come on, let's go.

46:56.682 --> 47:00.025
At each place you'll be, motherfucker.
Know that I want the money.

47:00.025 --> 47:02.765
Arno gets the money.
I'm not, fucking, around here.

47:02.765 --> 47:04.002
You hear me?

47:04.002 --> 47:05.898
Get him out of the car!

47:08.626 --> 47:10.938
Come on, come on.
Let's go. Let's go.

47:10.938 --> 47:12.342
Arno!

47:12.746 --> 47:14.035
Get in the fucking car.

47:14.035 --> 47:15.333
All right, all right.

47:15.333 --> 47:17.342
Listen to me, Arno!

47:17.342 --> 47:19.181
- Arno!
- Get in the car!

47:19.181 --> 47:21.026
- Take the opal.
- Don't worry about that.

47:21.196 --> 47:22.769
Don't worry about it.
Get in the car.

47:22.769 --> 47:24.101
No, I want the underwear.

47:24.855 --> 47:25.788
No, no!

47:25.788 --> 47:28.151
Come here. Come here.
Give me your, fucking, underwear.

47:30.213 --> 47:31.376
You cocksucker.

47:33.457 --> 47:34.899
Let him, fucking, rot in there.

47:35.085 --> 47:39.427
Fuck you, Arno!
You cocksucking motherfucker!

47:42.870 --> 47:46.609
Help!

47:50.648 --> 47:52.261
Are you fucking...

47:55.496 --> 47:57.239
Please.

47:57.239 --> 47:59.698
Pick up that phone.

48:03.683 --> 48:04.716
Come on. Come on.

48:04.716 --> 48:07.159
Howard, where are you?
Marcel is about to go on stage.

48:07.159 --> 48:08.618
- Dinah!
- What do you want?

48:08.618 --> 48:11.656
I locked my keys in the trunk of the car.
Can you please...

48:11.656 --> 48:14.426
Can you come to the parking lot
and open it for me?

48:19.846 --> 48:23.155
Fucking shit!
Fuck.

48:34.045 --> 48:36.515
It's okay. Thank you.
Okay?

48:39.111 --> 48:42.897
Sorry. I'll meet you right back inside.
It's all good now.

48:42.897 --> 48:45.160
Let me get dressed.

49:02.038 --> 49:06.447
<i>What could you possibly be looking for
in the forest, dressed in such thin paper rags?</i>

49:06.657 --> 49:08.933
<i>My wicked stepmother
has condemned me to die,</i>

49:08.933 --> 49:12.385
<i>lest I fill this basket with roses
before the coming of the dawn.</i>

49:13.672 --> 49:16.423
<i>Besides our cottage is our magic garden.</i>

49:16.423 --> 49:18.899
<i>It protects the roses from the snow.</i>

49:19.546 --> 49:22.652
<i>Go now and fill your basket
to your heart’s content.</i>

49:22.652 --> 49:25.340
- Dad, what the fuck?
- Just watch you, fucking, sister's play.

49:26.064 --> 49:30.517
<i>Thank you!</i>

49:30.977 --> 49:33.575
<i>We must bestow a gift upon her!</i>

49:33.575 --> 49:40.015
<i>I know! Every time she speaks,
gold coins shall spill forth from her mouth.</i>

49:40.015 --> 49:41.742
<i>This will be our gift!</i>

49:41.742 --> 49:44.036
<i>Quick! He approaches now.</i>

49:48.435 --> 49:50.420
This is Danny's part,
he's coming out.

49:50.501 --> 49:52.773
<i>Hark! Who goes there?</i>

49:53.476 --> 49:54.604
He did so good.

50:02.964 --> 50:06.268
Fuck me. Jesus Christ.

50:08.058 --> 50:10.316
- Hello.
- Hey, you picked up?

50:11.306 --> 50:14.036
When I block the caller you pick up,
when you know it's me you don't?

50:14.036 --> 50:15.425
What is that all about?

50:15.996 --> 50:18.903
Nah, I knew it was you, Howard
that’s why I picked up.

50:19.531 --> 50:21.428
Hey, where’s my, fucking, gem?

50:21.594 --> 50:25.095
Hey, you need to calm down.
Nothing’s happening with you acting like this.

50:25.095 --> 50:26.139
Listen motherfucker.

50:26.139 --> 50:28.465
I want my, fucking, property,
you understand me?

50:28.465 --> 50:30.226
Hey, watch your mouth, all right?

50:30.462 --> 50:32.309
You’re not dealing
with some broke ass niggas.

50:32.843 --> 50:36.584
You, fucking, put me on that bus ride home.
You think that was funny?

50:36.584 --> 50:39.958
What, the fuck, was that all about?
That, fucking, bus was disgusting!

50:40.162 --> 50:41.401
What explaining you want me to do?

50:41.401 --> 50:45.862
I'd go with you to locker-room, with your silly ass
it makes me look really, fucking, suspect.

50:45.862 --> 50:48.710
- Where's my gem? Where is it?
- I’m trying to help you, not fuck everything up.

50:48.884 --> 50:51.142
Jesus. I have it on me, right now.

50:51.142 --> 50:52.648
You have it on you?

50:53.176 --> 50:55.431
Yes, I’m about to
be back in the city.

50:55.576 --> 50:59.073
Okay, you're going to this, fucking,
Weeknd thing tonight?

51:00.687 --> 51:03.264
I wasn't planning on it,
but I could.

51:03.375 --> 51:07.013
You could? No it's not you could.
You will! You'll meet me there.

51:25.946 --> 51:28.476
Smells good, what it is?
Barbecue chicken?

51:34.739 --> 51:37.746
So, I wanted to talk about
the trunk scenario.

51:37.860 --> 51:40.294
It was, literally,
the most awkward thing, like...

51:42.177 --> 51:43.443
Where are you going?

51:43.443 --> 51:45.293
I'm heading into the city.

51:46.367 --> 51:48.001
Late night event.

51:48.001 --> 51:50.195
- Kinda go...
- It's the cake?

51:50.195 --> 51:55.249
Until 2, 3, you never know anymore.
So, I'll be exhausted tomorrow.

51:55.249 --> 51:56.944
Yeah, okay, sure.

52:05.910 --> 52:07.305
Good night.

52:09.665 --> 52:13.869
Anyway, I'll finish the conversation later,
but it was, literally, so awkward, like...

52:14.237 --> 52:15.783
Who are you talking to?

52:16.643 --> 52:17.694
Jessica.

52:17.694 --> 52:20.634
Hi Jessica.
How good was our girl tonight?

52:20.634 --> 52:22.265
You can't hear her.

52:22.265 --> 52:27.806
Okay, then, just hang up for a second,
let me talk to you, 2 secs.

52:27.876 --> 52:29.679
I'll call you back.

52:30.343 --> 52:31.786
What?

52:32.741 --> 52:36.123
I was very proud of you tonight.
You were beyond incredible.

52:36.123 --> 52:37.950
Yeah, you told me like 5 times already.

52:37.950 --> 52:39.924
Well, I just wanted to...

52:40.094 --> 52:43.042
You really really didn't know
how proud I was, okay?

52:43.042 --> 52:45.829
So I really, I just really really
want you to know.

52:45.829 --> 52:47.440
Okay, well, I do.

52:49.195 --> 52:51.103
Everything is cool, right?

52:51.103 --> 52:52.320
What do you mean?

52:52.320 --> 52:55.002
I don't know, I just.
Thought I would check in with you.

52:55.215 --> 52:56.586
Okay.

52:56.880 --> 52:59.127
Make sure everything's good.

52:59.752 --> 53:01.234
Why wouldn't I be good?

53:01.234 --> 53:03.367
I don't know,
I just thought I'd check in.

53:03.367 --> 53:06.392
Okay, well, I, literally, don't know
what you are talking about, so...

53:06.392 --> 53:08.796
That's right, 'cause I'm an idiot.

53:09.618 --> 53:14.034
So you love me.
Okay I'm gonna get into the city.

53:14.034 --> 53:16.383
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Have fun.

53:16.653 --> 53:18.214
Like I always do.

53:18.214 --> 53:19.902
Anyway, what were I saying?

53:19.902 --> 53:22.901
You know it was like a
complete resting bitch face, so...

53:41.371 --> 53:43.892
Hey, Demany, where...

53:44.493 --> 53:47.483
I didn't see you out front,
I don't, fucking, see you in here now.

53:48.176 --> 53:50.384
I can't believe I'm still
looking for you.

53:51.330 --> 53:56.434
Just, pick up your, fucking, phone, man.
I don't understand this!

53:57.314 --> 53:58.910
Don't fuck with me here.

54:01.901 --> 54:04.048
Hold on.

54:04.048 --> 54:05.534
Stop the music.

54:05.534 --> 54:07.145
Stop!

54:07.844 --> 54:10.063
Would somebody pass
the Weeknd the mic?

54:10.469 --> 54:12.113
Where, the fuck, is the blacklight?

54:12.113 --> 54:13.795
What's going on back there?

54:13.795 --> 54:15.105
No, I asked for blacklight.

54:15.105 --> 54:18.516
I'm not performing till it's,
fucking, blacklight on this, fucking, stage.

54:18.516 --> 54:20.031
Call out the blacklight.

54:20.031 --> 54:22.234
Blacklight.

54:22.234 --> 54:24.815
Close on with the Weeknd to those,
who turn on the blacklight.

54:26.849 --> 54:28.431
Blacklight.

54:29.100 --> 54:30.911
What's going on back there?

54:31.401 --> 54:32.585
I'm puzzled.

54:38.456 --> 54:39.850
That's what I'm talking about.

54:53.374 --> 54:56.306
Hey, Demany!

54:58.125 --> 55:00.437
Demany!

55:00.844 --> 55:03.761
Howard, I want you to meet,
my nigga, James.

55:05.222 --> 55:06.561
I've been hearing about you.

55:06.708 --> 55:08.168
Yo, where's that opal?

55:10.441 --> 55:11.537
I just need the opal.

55:12.686 --> 55:14.598
- What?
- The opal. Give me the opal.

55:14.774 --> 55:15.668
Oh. I don’t have it.

55:15.863 --> 55:18.113
You don't mind to shot me
anytime you want.

55:19.819 --> 55:20.590
What did you say? Where is it?

55:20.590 --> 55:22.465
Out of story. I don’t have it.

55:22.834 --> 55:24.583
You don't have it,
what do you mean?

55:24.699 --> 55:28.141
- KG got it, I don't have it.
- KG has? What the fuck are you talking about?

55:28.141 --> 55:30.225
You said on the phone you have it.

55:30.225 --> 55:32.247
Hey, change.
Man, I don't want this shit.

55:32.268 --> 55:34.506
Why, the fuck, are you here,
if you don't have the opal?

55:34.528 --> 55:38.689
Same, fucking, reason as everybody else is here,
to see the, fucking, Weeknd perform.

55:38.911 --> 55:39.800
You got a problem with that?

55:39.800 --> 55:42.009
I got a very big problem with that.

55:42.652 --> 55:44.153
We gave it for one day.

55:45.738 --> 55:48.036
What, the fuck, is wrong with you?
Calm your ass down.

55:49.108 --> 55:50.630
The fuck do you think this is?

55:52.884 --> 55:54.071
You good?

55:54.288 --> 55:56.415
I'm good. I'm good.

55:57.356 --> 55:59.064
Take the, fucking, drink, man.

56:20.803 --> 56:23.006
- What the fuck?
- Hey, fuck you, nigga.

56:57.078 --> 56:59.317
- It's on your face.
- It's okay, baby.

56:59.489 --> 57:01.398
- Is it off?
- Yeah, right there.

57:04.410 --> 57:05.758
What are you doing?

57:06.028 --> 57:07.142
Julia, what are you doing?

57:07.142 --> 57:09.932
No touching.

57:11.002 --> 57:12.905
I wanna fuck you so bad.

57:13.999 --> 57:15.260
How bad?

57:16.179 --> 57:17.417
I'll show you.

57:18.446 --> 57:19.247
I said no touching.

57:19.247 --> 57:21.129
Give that, fucking, ass.
Feel this shit. Feel this.

57:21.703 --> 57:23.446
Oh my God!

57:24.559 --> 57:27.026
How are you even
this hard right now?

57:28.001 --> 57:30.137
Slow down.
Where are you going?

57:30.736 --> 57:32.282
I was already inside.

57:32.282 --> 57:34.124
Listen, I don't remember
seeing you inside.

57:34.124 --> 57:36.873
I’m friends with The Weeknd,
He told me to come after his set.

57:37.112 --> 57:40.390
- Hey, Flawless, Flawless.
- Listen, watch the yelling!

57:40.588 --> 57:42.832
- Screaming over here...
- Yo, yo!

57:43.141 --> 57:45.742
- Yo, use the phone!
- Help me, this guy won't let me in!

57:45.742 --> 57:46.906
Come here!

57:46.906 --> 57:52.058
- The legend is in the, motherfucking, building.
- Come here, you gotta let me through.

57:52.415 --> 57:53.634
Let him in.

57:53.634 --> 57:55.417
- You know him?
- Sorry man, yeah, that's my guy.

57:55.417 --> 57:56.926
What's up, sexy?

57:56.926 --> 57:57.828
How are we doing?

57:57.828 --> 58:01.321
Hey, check this out, you see this
Rolls-Royce that I did in Miami?

58:01.646 --> 58:03.646
Yeah, Richie showed me all kinds of shit.

58:04.481 --> 58:05.844
Where is Julia?
Is she in there?

58:05.844 --> 58:07.160
Yeah, she's back there somewhere.

58:07.867 --> 58:10.024
Do you know what's going on
with my Michael Jackson pendant?

58:10.024 --> 58:11.266
What about that?

58:11.266 --> 58:12.813
What do you mean what about that?
I need it back.

58:12.813 --> 58:15.197
- It's in my safe.
- I'll come by tomorrow to pick it up.

58:15.197 --> 58:17.323
She's trying to sell
this thing to the Weekend.

58:17.460 --> 58:18.818
- You understand?
- Yeah.

58:18.818 --> 58:19.960
What do you mean "yeah"?

58:20.957 --> 58:22.401
Where is she now?

58:22.401 --> 58:25.145
- Yeah.
- But where?

58:27.005 --> 58:27.824
Where?

58:27.824 --> 58:30.101
I don't mean to get in you business,
I don't wanna get involved,

58:30.101 --> 58:32.605
but I saw her go to
bathroom with Weeknd.

58:40.035 --> 58:40.933
Julia!

58:40.933 --> 58:42.554
- Oh shit!
- Julia, are you in there?

58:42.786 --> 58:44.100
Yo, I said to hold the door, bro.

58:44.100 --> 58:45.373
Open up the door!

58:45.432 --> 58:47.667
- Someone's in it.
- Shut the fuck up!

58:47.849 --> 58:49.964
Give me one second,
I need to wash my hands.

58:50.018 --> 58:52.000
- What the fuck is this?
- Howard we were just doing coke.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.244
Nothing happened!

58:53.678 --> 58:55.355
Let go!
Let go off me!

58:58.052 --> 58:59.289
Get off him!

59:10.038 --> 59:11.884
Stop fighting!

59:11.884 --> 59:13.917
Hey, get, the fuck, back off me!

59:14.388 --> 59:15.679
Fuck you!

59:16.328 --> 59:18.344
Fuck that, motherfucker, right there!

59:19.900 --> 59:21.375
Shut the fuck up!

59:21.375 --> 59:23.158
I'm so sorry, Howard.

59:23.158 --> 59:24.979
Fuck you!

59:25.638 --> 59:27.590
Let's go!
Get the fuck out!

59:27.921 --> 59:31.588
You tell the, fucking, guy he's sued.
He's getting sued.

59:32.986 --> 59:38.142
Not one, fucking, DJ gonna play his shit.
I know every, fucking, DJ in this town.

59:38.580 --> 59:40.118
Fuck all you losers!

59:40.624 --> 59:42.729
You smell like
his, fucking, cologne!

59:43.146 --> 59:45.184
We didn't do anything, Howard!

59:45.184 --> 59:46.844
Yeah, right, right!

59:49.291 --> 59:52.441
You blew a huge,
fucking, sale for me!

59:52.509 --> 59:54.864
What were you selling,
your, fucking, hot snatch?

59:55.200 --> 59:58.661
Blowing my whole, fucking, life away
for this skank over here.

59:58.685 --> 01:00:01.880
Oh, wow, okay.
Now I'm a, fucking, skank?

01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.931
- Were, the fuck, are you, you fuck?
- Listen, Howard.

01:00:03.931 --> 01:00:06.401
You knew what, the fuck, it was
when you met me.

01:00:06.401 --> 01:00:07.820
That's right, yeah.
That's right.

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:10.389
That’s why I wish I never, fucking, met you.
Right here.

01:00:10.389 --> 01:00:15.023
- Oh wow, that's great Howard, Howard.
- Get out of my, fucking, way!

01:00:15.321 --> 01:00:17.043
Go fuck the Weeknd.

01:00:17.043 --> 01:00:19.804
- We didn't, fucking, do anything!
- Fuck off me!

01:00:19.804 --> 01:00:23.359
Go, go. It's fine. Go.
Good night. Bye. Get, the fuck, away!

01:00:23.456 --> 01:00:25.160
- Howard.
- Go!

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:27.834
Howard.

01:00:27.834 --> 01:00:29.298
Howard. Get out of, the fucking, car!

01:00:29.298 --> 01:00:31.520
Get, the fuck, out of the way!

01:00:32.145 --> 01:00:35.462
What are you gonna do, Howard?
What are you gonna do, big tough guy?

01:00:35.462 --> 01:00:38.708
- I didn't, fucking, do anything with him?
- Get, the fuck, out of here!

01:00:38.709 --> 01:00:40.755
Get, the fuck, away!
Go fuck the guy!

01:00:40.894 --> 01:00:43.839
Fuck you, Howard!
I'll see you tomorrow.

01:00:43.874 --> 01:00:46.302
I'll see you tomorrow, Howard!

01:00:46.692 --> 01:00:49.552
Let's go. Go!
Fuck you!

01:01:23.755 --> 01:01:25.596
What, the fuck, are you looking at?

01:01:26.164 --> 01:01:27.528
Nothing much.

01:01:27.827 --> 01:01:30.117
Oh, funny. Stupid bitch.

01:01:30.704 --> 01:01:33.410
That's why you're in line
in the, fucking, cold.

01:01:33.563 --> 01:01:34.992
Stupid bitch.

01:03:05.668 --> 01:03:08.309
- No, no, no. Listen, Anne.
- Howard, Howard.

01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:10.657
I'm looking at it.
I'm looking at the opal.

01:03:10.657 --> 01:03:13.253
- You are missing the point.
- I'm looking at it right now, okay?

01:03:13.253 --> 01:03:14.182
It's gorgeous.

01:03:14.182 --> 01:03:16.456
It is not you who should be
looking at it, it's me.

01:03:16.456 --> 01:03:17.465
Turn that down.

01:03:17.465 --> 01:03:19.455
Let me explain
something to you, Mr. Ratner.

01:03:19.455 --> 01:03:23.534
Your opal is one of the 75 items
I have to oversee for this auction.

01:03:23.534 --> 01:03:27.020
All of them but yours have been cleaned,
cataloged and appraised.

01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:29.386
Listen, I'm doing some appraisals
of my own, okay?

01:03:29.481 --> 01:03:31.390
And then I’m gonna
bring it to you today.

01:03:31.390 --> 01:03:33.057
I am on the precipice of pulling it.

01:03:33.057 --> 01:03:36.183
- I swear to you, please, okay?
- End of the day or we’re done.

01:03:36.183 --> 01:03:40.059
I'm getting a call right now,
so I have to go.

01:03:41.544 --> 01:03:43.544
This is Howard Ratner.
Hi, Janet, thank you so much

01:03:43.850 --> 01:03:45.587
- for calling me back so quickly.
- Yeah, no problem.

01:03:45.587 --> 01:03:47.917
That message you left
was actually very disturbing.

01:03:48.199 --> 01:03:49.882
No, I didn't mean to worry you.

01:03:49.882 --> 01:03:51.881
Okay, would you mind telling
me what this is about?

01:03:51.881 --> 01:03:55.073
I saw online that your boss
represents Kevin Garnett?

01:03:55.211 --> 01:03:58.267
- I'm gonna have to put you on hold for one moment.
- Okay, sure, I'll hang on.

01:03:58.359 --> 01:04:03.239
- Howard, Julia's on line 1.
- No. No, tell her no. I'm not here.

01:04:03.397 --> 01:04:05.182
Fuck it!

01:04:07.322 --> 01:04:08.263
Where are you?

01:04:08.263 --> 01:04:10.147
Why aren't you answering your phone?

01:04:10.764 --> 01:04:12.559
I asked you a question,
where are you?

01:04:12.707 --> 01:04:14.812
I stayed at Kat’s house,
where else do you think?

01:04:14.812 --> 01:04:17.358
I couldn’t, fucking, go home
with you acting that way.

01:04:17.358 --> 01:04:18.328
No, that's...

01:04:18.328 --> 01:04:20.538
So, let me guess,
you're not coming to work today?

01:04:20.762 --> 01:04:21.643
I would like to.

01:04:21.643 --> 01:04:24.839
That must be nice to
come to work whenever you feel like it.

01:04:25.317 --> 01:04:28.359
- Howard.
- Is that good, is that good?

01:04:28.508 --> 01:04:30.391
Maybe, you should take a nap then?

01:04:30.763 --> 01:04:32.426
- Can't we just...
- Take a nap, get your rest...

01:04:32.426 --> 01:04:35.124
 you need to remain attractive, right?

01:04:37.081 --> 01:04:38.524
Answer me.

01:04:38.708 --> 01:04:40.782
I just wanna sit down
and talk to you, Howard.

01:04:40.782 --> 01:04:41.601
- Okay.
- I don't wanna do this right now.

01:04:41.601 --> 01:04:44.045
- I don't wanna play.
- And I just need to work, okay?

01:04:44.045 --> 01:04:47.574
I need to work to make sure
that your cheating ass is taking care of.

01:04:47.578 --> 01:04:49.798
- ... personnel on line 2.
- Goodbye!

01:04:51.086 --> 01:04:52.372
This is Howard Ratner.

01:04:52.372 --> 01:04:54.504
My assistant told me that you called?
How are you doing?

01:04:54.664 --> 01:04:56.621
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I could be better.

01:04:56.746 --> 01:04:58.593
Sorry to hear that,
so what can I do for you?

01:04:58.593 --> 01:05:02.489
I've been having a situation
with one of your higher profile players.

01:05:02.489 --> 01:05:06.690
And I'm moments away right now
from making things very ugly for you.

01:05:06.690 --> 01:05:09.359
- Okay, can you hang on for a second?
- No, I'm not hanging on.

01:05:09.359 --> 01:05:12.204
I happen to be a litigious individual,

01:05:12.305 --> 01:05:15.322
and I'm a second away
from hanging up right now

01:05:15.465 --> 01:05:17.876
- and calling my lawyer and the police...
- Whoa, whoah, whoah.

01:05:17.876 --> 01:05:20.421
- You realize I have no idea what you’re talking about.
- Howard, KG is here with Demany.

01:05:20.421 --> 01:05:22.439
You’re getting very hot very fast and
you’re starting to sound like an asshole so

01:05:22.439 --> 01:05:24.554
- maybe you wanna back off...
- Nevermind.

01:05:27.064 --> 01:05:29.573
Kevin, hey.

01:05:32.081 --> 01:05:33.474
Buzz the men in.

01:05:35.445 --> 01:05:37.675
- Buzz them.
- I am. I am, Howard.

01:05:37.836 --> 01:05:39.229
That's the fucking door.

01:05:39.229 --> 01:05:41.819
Got to the other buzzer, please.
Hurry up.

01:05:42.735 --> 01:05:44.526
I'll be right there.
Go ahead.

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:47.625
- That's not working.
- Goddamnit!

01:05:47.834 --> 01:05:48.874
Goddamnit!

01:05:48.981 --> 01:05:51.120
- Hang up, sorry.
- Open this shit, man.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:53.049
- I'm sorry.
- We don't have time for this shit.

01:05:53.049 --> 01:05:55.300
- Magnets sometimes...
- I don't give a fuck about that.

01:05:55.479 --> 01:05:57.512
- You brought the gem?
- I'm claustrophobic.

01:05:57.512 --> 01:06:00.593
- Oh, yeah, I got the gem right here.
- Okay, all right, good, there it is.

01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:01.740
We'll go upstairs and wait.

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:03.998
You can't leave,
because that one is locked over.

01:06:04.159 --> 01:06:06.889
Get a, fucking,
hammer over there.

01:06:07.037 --> 01:06:09.414
Roman, he needs the hammer.
He needs the hammer.

01:06:09.428 --> 01:06:11.033
Let me get a hammer.

01:06:12.739 --> 01:06:15.146
I, actually, don't know how
this will work, but...

01:06:15.649 --> 01:06:17.744
- Give me the hammer.
- I'm on it, I'm coming.

01:06:17.744 --> 01:06:20.548
It usually works.
This will work. Give me this.

01:06:20.987 --> 01:06:22.517
And get ready to buzz, okay?

01:06:22.777 --> 01:06:24.881
- Oh my God, nigga!
- I'm sorry, buzz, buzz.

01:06:25.351 --> 01:06:27.882
- That shit is louder than bitch.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

01:06:28.775 --> 01:06:29.745
Gotta hit it from the side.

01:06:29.745 --> 01:06:32.175
- Flawless is here.
- Get rid of this motherfucker.

01:06:32.685 --> 01:06:34.480
- Tell him to vibe.
- Oh my God, Flawless is here?

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:37.140
Defy, the fucking, Flawless!
Roman!

01:06:37.777 --> 01:06:40.628
- Roman! Come on here.
- Oh, shit!

01:06:40.628 --> 01:06:43.189
All right, listen, we're having
a, fucking, connection issue.

01:06:43.189 --> 01:06:47.604
Just get me some, fucking, metal shavings
and the tool, fucking, kit, all right?

01:06:48.163 --> 01:06:49.987
Goddamnit!

01:06:50.996 --> 01:06:54.519
I'm going to get this...
I promise you this will work.

01:06:54.519 --> 01:06:56.195
Hurry the fuck up, Roman!
Thank you.

01:06:57.131 --> 01:07:00.895
Hey, Howard. I'm here to buy the opal.
This is a game day for me!

01:07:00.895 --> 01:07:03.505
- I know, I know it is.
- What the fuck is going on?

01:07:03.505 --> 01:07:05.948
- I got 175 thousand in this bag.
- 175?

01:07:05.948 --> 01:07:08.576
I told you that thing's worth
over a million dollars, that's...

01:07:08.576 --> 01:07:11.295
Howard, come on, man!
What the fuck are you doing?

01:07:11.295 --> 01:07:13.042
... Court-side seats.

01:07:13.057 --> 01:07:16.579
I live in New York, I don't know
what’s that gonna do me, KG?

01:07:16.995 --> 01:07:19.555
I wanna give you to you for free,
I'm that kind of guy.

01:07:19.705 --> 01:07:21.475
Just... I'm tied into an auction.

01:07:21.475 --> 01:07:22.679
What are talking...
What auction?

01:07:22.679 --> 01:07:24.777
The auction...
Listen, make a bid.

01:07:24.777 --> 01:07:26.324
- Make a bid at the auction.
- When is it?

01:07:26.324 --> 01:07:27.437
- It's Monday.
- Monday.

01:07:27.577 --> 01:07:30.578
- Nah, let him rent it for a couple nights.
- I can't.

01:07:30.578 --> 01:07:33.251
I’ll just hold it till Monday,
you'll get it back Monday night.

01:07:33.251 --> 01:07:36.971
- Kevin, I hate letting you down.
- This dude fucking says "no" to everything.

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:39.188
- Say "yes" to something.
- I want to, Kevin.

01:07:39.188 --> 01:07:41.985
I fucking love ya.
I feel like an asshole, believe me.

01:07:42.696 --> 01:07:46.757
Come down, let me, fucking, do this.
Jesus, fucking... I got this.

01:07:47.027 --> 01:07:49.600
Godd, fucking, damnit.
I gotta do everything.

01:07:49.809 --> 01:07:52.513
Please, stop knocking.
It's not gonna help.

01:07:52.513 --> 01:07:54.013
Go. Go.

01:07:54.626 --> 01:07:56.814
- I'm so, goddamnit, sorry.
- Jesus Christ!

01:07:58.911 --> 01:08:00.883
Get them some water.
Get the cold water.

01:08:00.883 --> 01:08:02.048
We don't need any water, man.

01:08:02.048 --> 01:08:03.834
Go get my ring, man,
so I can get the hell out of here.

01:08:03.834 --> 01:08:05.875
Get him his fucking ring.
He’s got shit to do, come on!

01:08:05.875 --> 01:08:09.149
- Oh, the ring, the ring...
- He's got a game, Howard.

01:08:09.391 --> 01:08:13.153
Oh my God, no, I left the,
fucking, ring in Long Island.

01:08:13.153 --> 01:08:15.604
What, the fuck, do you mean
you left it in Long Island?

01:08:15.604 --> 01:08:16.545
I'll give it to Demany.

01:08:16.545 --> 01:08:18.819
- I don't have time for this.
- I'll give it to Demany.

01:08:18.995 --> 01:08:20.395
I'll give it to you.

01:08:20.395 --> 01:08:23.142
Listen, I can't do this.
I don't have time for this.

01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:24.702
You don't have to,
I do need...

01:08:24.702 --> 01:08:26.763
I know what I need is stone.
I need the stone.

01:08:26.763 --> 01:08:29.252
- You need the stone?
- Where's my ring at though?

01:08:29.363 --> 01:08:31.157
I'll get you the ring,
I'm gonna get it to Demany.

01:08:31.157 --> 01:08:33.904
Give me favor.
Get my ring for me and I'll see you later.

01:08:33.926 --> 01:08:37.130
Howard, this is bullshit.
Open this fucking door.

01:08:37.278 --> 01:08:40.656
Why did we come up here, man?
Buzz us out, Howard.

01:08:40.656 --> 01:08:42.934
We'll buzz you out, all right?
Please, buzz them out.

01:08:43.058 --> 01:08:46.803
KG, forgive everything
I did and the time I wasted.

01:08:47.053 --> 01:08:50.069
You fucking asshole,
you fucking did this!

01:08:51.078 --> 01:08:54.127
- What have you been telling him?
- What the fuck are talking about, Howard?

01:08:54.282 --> 01:08:56.506
This how this shit works.
I bring niggas here,

01:08:56.613 --> 01:08:59.062
to you, to buy jewelry.
That's how I get, fucking, paid.

01:08:59.149 --> 01:09:01.112
You got a lot of nerve,
talking to me right now

01:09:01.112 --> 01:09:03.234
- The fuck you talking about?
- after the fiasco you, fucking, caused.

01:09:03.234 --> 01:09:06.644
That nigga just offered you a quarter
of a million dollars for a, fucking, rock, dummy.

01:09:06.948 --> 01:09:08.238
- That's all me!
- Of course, it's you, right.

01:09:08.787 --> 01:09:10.236
- And I had nothing to do with it.
- That’s 20 fucking grand...

01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:12.636
You spent for those guys
in Ethiopia, right?

01:09:12.636 --> 01:09:14.983
You put all those calls in...
Yeah, my bad.

01:09:15.210 --> 01:09:17.148
Fuck you, my nigga.
I'm taking all my niggas somewhere.

01:09:17.148 --> 01:09:18.764
- Where's my shit at?
- Get the fuck...

01:09:18.764 --> 01:09:20.332
What, the fuck, are you doing?
Get out of here!

01:09:20.332 --> 01:09:21.499
- Where's my shit?
- Get out of here!

01:09:21.499 --> 01:09:23.933
- It's only 3, fucking, watches in here.
- I don't want you in there!

01:09:23.933 --> 01:09:24.968
Where, the fuck, is the rest of my shit?!

01:09:24.968 --> 01:09:27.426
- Where are my watches at, only 3 in here?
- I loaned them. I loaned them.

01:09:27.426 --> 01:09:30.372
- What do you mean you loaned them?
- These are fake Rolex.

01:09:30.372 --> 01:09:33.118
Nigga, that’s my shit!
Nigga, those boxes are mad expensive!

01:09:33.118 --> 01:09:34.975
- You fucking idiot.
- All right, I owe you then.

01:09:35.161 --> 01:09:37.863
- Get out of here, I said!
- Man, fuck you! Get the fuck off me!

01:09:37.863 --> 01:09:40.624
- Howard, I have Dr. Blauman on line 1.
- Where the fuck is my shit?

01:09:40.624 --> 01:09:41.874
Go ahead. Go ahead.

01:09:41.874 --> 01:09:42.863
Hi!

01:09:43.013 --> 01:09:45.135
- Howard?
- Hi, doctor, what's going on?

01:09:45.939 --> 01:09:47.004
- Howard?
- Yes.

01:09:47.004 --> 01:09:48.639
- Where's the, goddamn, paper, man?
- Please be quiet.

01:09:48.639 --> 01:09:50.291
- Is everything okay?
- Where's the, fucking, paper, Howard?

01:09:50.408 --> 01:09:51.685
Shut, the fuck, up!

01:09:51.685 --> 01:09:54.187
- Howard?
- Go ahead. Go ahead, I'm sorry.

01:09:54.518 --> 01:09:56.597
- Howard...
- What do I got?

01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:57.720
Fuck this shit, man.

01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.601
I'm looking at the results
from your colonoscopy.

01:10:00.631 --> 01:10:02.599
So, we're good, you're all good,
everything came back clean.

01:10:02.599 --> 01:10:07.402
Doctor, all clean a 100%?
You said it's good?

01:10:07.635 --> 01:10:09.676
- Yes, I said you're all clean.
- Oh, good, good, thank you.

01:10:09.676 --> 01:10:12.066
- That's relief.
- Howard, relax, this is just...

01:10:12.595 --> 01:10:14.989
My father, fucking, died from it, so...

01:10:15.161 --> 01:10:19.160
Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't mean to scare you.
But, you know, given your head family history.

01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:24.200
I know, Jews and colon cancer, what is that?
I thought we were the chosen people.

01:10:24.521 --> 01:10:26.786
Look, colon cancer just paid
for my house in the Hamptons...

01:10:26.786 --> 01:10:30.348
Don't tell me that. Where?
What part of the Hamptons? How many acres?

01:10:30.348 --> 01:10:32.382
What are you doing?
You gonna kill the fish.

01:10:32.382 --> 01:10:33.328
What the fuck?

01:10:33.328 --> 01:10:35.793
- My fish! My fish!
- Fuck your fish, nigga!

01:10:36.395 --> 01:10:38.517
Get a glass! Get a glass!

01:10:38.788 --> 01:10:41.286
- Fuck your, goddamn, fish, nigga!
- What, the fuck, are you doing?

01:10:41.286 --> 01:10:42.935
You, fucking, asshole!

01:10:42.935 --> 01:10:46.141
Get the, fucking, another glass.
Get another glass, goddamnit!

01:10:46.141 --> 01:10:49.400
Come here, I got you.
Here you go, here you go.

01:10:49.512 --> 01:10:50.825
I got you, sweetheart.

01:10:50.825 --> 01:10:53.653
Johnny, please get some more glasses.

01:10:53.653 --> 01:10:56.116
They can’t see the water.
They’re blind.

01:10:56.116 --> 01:10:57.893
All right, Howard,
I'm hanging up.

01:10:57.893 --> 01:10:59.935
I thought I was perfectly clear.

01:11:00.232 --> 01:11:03.258
- At 5:30 I am out the door.
- I told you I was coming to you.

01:11:03.258 --> 01:11:06.023
I'm coming to you. I have the stone.
Don't you dare leave.

01:11:06.023 --> 01:11:08.362
- I have a wedding in Newport...
- Howard.

01:11:08.362 --> 01:11:09.474
No!

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:10.699
Howard.

01:11:10.699 --> 01:11:13.373
Stop. You're being,
fucking, crazy again. Stop.

01:11:13.451 --> 01:11:15.277
Listen, I got no time to talk.

01:11:15.277 --> 01:11:17.845
I have to be at Adley's in
50 minutes before they close.

01:11:17.893 --> 01:11:20.288
- I'll go with you. I'll go with you.
- Then I gotta get to my father-in-law.

01:11:20.288 --> 01:11:23.395
Howard, please, I'm really sick.
I don't feel well. I gotta out of bed...

01:11:23.395 --> 01:11:25.809
I see you were in a big rush
to come over here?

01:11:25.974 --> 01:11:28.142
You got yourself a, fucking, smoothie!

01:11:28.142 --> 01:11:30.793
- I was in a big rush.
- I want you out.

01:11:30.793 --> 01:11:32.235
You motherfucker!

01:11:32.235 --> 01:11:34.375
Get out of the apartment
by the end of the day.

01:11:34.375 --> 01:11:35.797
Fuck you!

01:11:35.801 --> 01:11:37.208
Out of my life.

01:11:40.779 --> 01:11:42.496
You have no idea.

01:11:59.201 --> 01:12:00.826
- How you're doing, Howie?
- Hey.

01:12:02.307 --> 01:12:03.324
Good Pesach, Howie.

01:12:03.703 --> 01:12:05.943
All right, Larry, you're Jew again,
welcome back.

01:12:09.046 --> 01:12:11.216
- Have a good Pascha.
- It's all right.

01:12:11.536 --> 01:12:12.908
- Hey, Howard.
- Hey.

01:12:21.610 --> 01:12:26.627
Baruch Atah Adonai Eloheinu Melech Ha
Olam Bore Peri Ha Adama.

01:12:28.353 --> 01:12:30.053
Get the celery.

01:12:42.677 --> 01:12:45.176
You know what kinda suck
schmuck a little bit, overrated?

01:12:45.327 --> 01:12:46.658
Chris Paul.

01:12:46.658 --> 01:12:48.219
Come on, man,
he's all NBA, man.

01:12:48.219 --> 01:12:50.261
He can't do it alone.

01:12:50.409 --> 01:12:51.255
That's enough!

01:12:51.255 --> 01:12:52.878
You don't know anything.
What are you saying?

01:12:52.878 --> 01:12:55.182
- I'm talking...
- Shut up everybody!

01:12:55.478 --> 01:12:56.240
Please.

01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.011
Natalie. You're up.

01:12:58.435 --> 01:13:00.221
Wait, you skipped my dad.

01:13:01.253 --> 01:13:02.670
Where are we?

01:13:02.803 --> 01:13:05.615
Howard, why don't you
read the plagues?

01:13:09.094 --> 01:13:13.355
Okay. Ma, you take the Hebrew
and I'll take the English.

01:13:13.505 --> 01:13:15.098
Yes, my dear.

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:17.528
Here we go.

01:13:17.909 --> 01:13:20.555
- Dam.
- Blood.

01:13:21.067 --> 01:13:23.653
- Tzefardea.
- Frogs.

01:13:24.092 --> 01:13:26.731
- Kinim.
- Lice.

01:13:27.026 --> 01:13:29.874
- Arov.
- Boiled animals.

01:13:30.211 --> 01:13:33.016
- Dever.
- Pestilence.

01:13:33.239 --> 01:13:36.176
- Sh’chin.
- Boils.

01:13:36.176 --> 01:13:39.103
- Barad.
- Hail.

01:13:39.529 --> 01:13:42.075

01:13:42.387 --> 01:13:44.618
- Choshech.

01:13:45.206 --> 01:13:49.072
- Makat Bechorot.
- Death of the first born.

01:13:49.072 --> 01:13:51.532
Hardcore, back there.

01:13:52.163 --> 01:13:54.163
That can still happen.

01:13:54.789 --> 01:13:57.311
You know, watch yourselves, kids.

01:14:00.084 --> 01:14:03.542
- Hey, Julia, leave me a message...
- Excuse me.

01:14:04.911 --> 01:14:08.389
You send me something like that
and then you don't pick up your phone?

01:14:09.756 --> 01:14:11.718
Are you, fucking, with me?

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:15.141
I'm trying to have a nice,
peaceful dinner

01:14:15.763 --> 01:14:18.126
with my family, which is something
you won't understand,

01:14:18.126 --> 01:14:19.730
because you don't have one.

01:14:19.730 --> 01:14:21.663
You wanna play mind games with me?

01:14:23.332 --> 01:14:25.409
So, whatever you meant
by your little link,

01:14:25.536 --> 01:14:29.436
I meant when I said that I want
you out of my apartment tonight.

01:14:30.591 --> 01:14:34.191
And I want confirmation,
by text, not a link.

01:14:34.542 --> 01:14:41.034
Via text, "Howie, I am gone, 10 PM".
Don't you, fucking, call me!

01:14:47.789 --> 01:14:50.821
Arno, what the fuck?
Can we just, fucking, talk?

01:14:50.821 --> 01:14:52.413
We're family, we're here,
right now.

01:14:52.413 --> 01:14:53.777
Out of my way.

01:14:53.777 --> 01:14:56.870
Yeah, not so tough without
your friends around, are you?

01:14:57.343 --> 01:14:59.677
Are you?

01:15:00.257 --> 01:15:02.053
Fucking pussy!

01:15:02.173 --> 01:15:04.632
- You like, you love this roster?
- I love it.

01:15:04.880 --> 01:15:08.436
Baron Davis is done.
Let's start fresh: Melo, Amare.

01:15:08.436 --> 01:15:09.950
- What about Lin?
- That's it.

01:15:09.950 --> 01:15:10.853
We gotta bring back Lin.

01:15:10.853 --> 01:15:13.453
You know what, fucking, Lin’s
not coming back next year?

01:15:13.453 --> 01:15:15.679
Cause Dolan saw how everybody
were so fucking happy,

01:15:15.679 --> 01:15:18.382
- and said "how can I ruin that?".
- Exactly! Howard, fucking, knows.

01:15:18.416 --> 01:15:21.870
You realize that I met my wife
at the first game that started Linsanity.

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:23.538
You know what he says to me.

01:15:23.696 --> 01:15:26.576
He comes over to me
and says "Happy Holidays".

01:15:27.106 --> 01:15:28.884
Like it's Christmas.

01:15:28.975 --> 01:15:31.507
It's like having
an intruder in your own home.

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:34.708
He's not bothering anybody, all right?

01:15:34.872 --> 01:15:35.701
He's trying.

01:15:35.701 --> 01:15:38.220
Easy for you to say,
he didn’t marry your daughter.

01:15:55.584 --> 01:15:57.807
This is, KG, huh?

01:15:57.924 --> 01:16:00.725
Off. Three for eleven?
What the fuck?

01:16:01.229 --> 01:16:02.409
He looks tortured.

01:16:02.409 --> 01:16:05.032
That, fucking, guy tried
to steal an opal from me.

01:16:05.032 --> 01:16:07.492
- Your opal? Your opal It came?
- The opal came, yeah.

01:16:07.889 --> 01:16:10.534
Stupidly, I lent it
to this motherfucker and he's...

01:16:10.534 --> 01:16:11.979
What do you mean?
He took it? He stole it?

01:16:11.979 --> 01:16:15.881
He didn't steal it, he got carried away.
He thinks it has magic powers.

01:16:15.881 --> 01:16:17.837
Magic powers?

01:16:19.128 --> 01:16:21.023
- No, really?
- Look, look at him tonight.

01:16:21.023 --> 01:16:23.914
Without it, he didn't have it tonight,
look how fucking bad he played.

01:16:24.281 --> 01:16:25.730
He wants to own it.

01:16:25.730 --> 01:16:29.811
So, I told him to come to the auction
and, fucking, make a bid for it like everyone else.

01:16:29.868 --> 01:16:32.005
- When is this auction?
- The auction is Monday.

01:16:33.303 --> 01:16:35.330
Okay, so what do you think it's worth?

01:16:35.569 --> 01:16:40.571
Well, listen, it's anywhere from
a thousand to 3 thousand dollars a carat.

01:16:40.612 --> 01:16:42.235
And it's 6 hundred carats.

01:16:42.381 --> 01:16:45.946
That's over a million dollars.
He's very rich.

01:16:46.170 --> 01:16:48.828
Not as rich as Gooey!
But I’m working on it.

01:16:49.574 --> 01:16:52.192
Who’s comparing? Rich is rich.

01:16:52.192 --> 01:16:56.773
I made a crazy risk at a gamble
and, it's about to pay off.

01:17:02.925 --> 01:17:05.539
Don't look at us,
don't look at him, don't look at me.

01:17:05.539 --> 01:17:07.321
Find it yourself.

01:17:07.467 --> 01:17:09.105
Come on, keep looking.

01:17:09.105 --> 01:17:10.548
That's warm, warm, warm.

01:17:10.687 --> 01:17:12.142
Warmer.

01:17:12.833 --> 01:17:14.176
Very warm.

01:17:14.176 --> 01:17:16.338
Keep looking.

01:17:16.821 --> 01:17:19.107
I found it!

01:17:19.304 --> 01:17:20.986
That's my boy!

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:27.808
Find your stuff, we're leaving soon.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:31.692
Let's show them.

01:17:31.782 --> 01:17:35.404
Dad, look, this is Mom's
Bar mitzvah dress, it still fits her.

01:17:35.619 --> 01:17:37.511
Oh. That’s hysterical.

01:17:38.995 --> 01:17:41.344
It’s 9 o'clock, what do you think,
we should get going?

01:17:41.344 --> 01:17:43.843
- Yeah let's go, tell the boys.
- I told them.

01:17:48.492 --> 01:17:50.305
What?

01:17:50.917 --> 01:17:53.248
- You look gorgeous.
- Oh God!

01:17:55.205 --> 01:17:58.295
I wanted to talk to you for a minute.

01:17:59.138 --> 01:18:02.431
Just sit down, and,
we don't have to do it here.

01:18:02.618 --> 01:18:04.899
We'll wait, but I...

01:18:06.014 --> 01:18:08.651
I'm having very serious
second thoughts.

01:18:12.242 --> 01:18:16.571
We're all together right now.
We're all so comfortable, excited.

01:18:17.058 --> 01:18:19.707
Is it too late? Should we maybe...

01:18:20.647 --> 01:18:22.781
What do you think?
Am I crazy?

01:18:22.932 --> 01:18:24.257
Are you serious right now?

01:18:24.525 --> 01:18:26.607
Yeah, I know,
I know I fucked up.

01:18:26.832 --> 01:18:28.791
Yeah, you fucked up.
You are a fuckup.

01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:30.481
And I'm not having
this conversation.

01:18:30.508 --> 01:18:35.084
Please, stop, just stop for one second
and just look at me, look at my eyes.

01:18:35.119 --> 01:18:37.208
And they'll tell you what I'm feeling.

01:18:37.208 --> 01:18:39.351
Please?

01:18:50.931 --> 01:18:53.879
What?
What are you thinking?

01:18:54.603 --> 01:18:57.436
What? Tell me.
I wanna know.

01:18:57.823 --> 01:18:59.948
I know. What?

01:18:59.948 --> 01:19:03.403
Your face is so stupid.

01:19:04.530 --> 01:19:07.239
- Okay.
- Oh my God.

01:19:07.239 --> 01:19:10.440
I'm gonna leave her.
I'll leave her. I don't need her.

01:19:10.909 --> 01:19:12.667
We're done.

01:19:12.667 --> 01:19:13.518
- Okay.
- It's done.

01:19:13.518 --> 01:19:15.874
It was stupid. She's trash.

01:19:16.804 --> 01:19:18.804
She's trash. I know that.

01:19:19.907 --> 01:19:23.469
It was stupid. I'm done.
I'm done. It means nothing.

01:19:23.469 --> 01:19:24.850
It meant nothing.

01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:29.144
Please. I'm begging, you just
give me another shot.

01:19:32.150 --> 01:19:33.673
You know what, Howard?

01:19:33.673 --> 01:19:35.684
Say yes, what?

01:19:35.684 --> 01:19:39.235
I think you are the most
annoying person I've ever met.

01:19:39.588 --> 01:19:42.078
I hate being with you.
I hate looking at you.

01:19:42.513 --> 01:19:46.001
And if I had my way,
I would never see you again.

01:19:47.088 --> 01:19:49.988
That's 'cause you're mad.
You're mad and it makes sense.

01:19:51.332 --> 01:19:54.208
- You can punch me if you want.
- Oh, thanks.

01:19:58.653 --> 01:20:00.157
I don't even want to touch you.

01:20:00.157 --> 01:20:02.712
Oh my God!
Are you kidding me?

01:20:02.712 --> 01:20:03.545
Wait. Turn around.
I wanna see.

01:20:03.545 --> 01:20:05.446
- Did you see that?
- Oh my God!

01:20:05.446 --> 01:20:08.214
I hate you!
That's how fit you're right now?

01:20:08.319 --> 01:20:10.478
I was fifteen pounds overweight!

01:20:10.793 --> 01:20:13.743
I'll get the car, okay?
I'll get the car.

01:20:24.135 --> 01:20:25.696
She's always...

01:20:25.861 --> 01:20:29.060
Like we wanna see everything
she's doing at every moment.

01:20:29.952 --> 01:20:32.593
- You think she's jealous of me?
- Yeah, she wants your life.

01:20:33.095 --> 01:20:35.616
- She wants our house.
- And she can have it.

01:20:36.946 --> 01:20:38.652
Why are you taking Lex?

01:20:38.652 --> 01:20:41.092
We'll take the tunnel,
it’s better, less traffic.

01:20:42.725 --> 01:20:46.654
Plus, I wanna grab something from
the apartment, and it’s right there.

01:20:53.254 --> 01:20:55.449
We gonna stop
by the apartment, guys.

01:20:55.449 --> 01:20:57.558
Oh my God.

01:20:57.894 --> 01:21:01.413
- Daddy's got thinks to do.
- Oh, it's so annoying.

01:21:01.791 --> 01:21:03.397
That business.

01:21:14.856 --> 01:21:17.031
- Hi, Mr. Ratner, how are you?
- How are you?

01:21:17.067 --> 01:21:19.132
- Anything in the trunk?
- I’m just gonna be up and down.

01:21:19.132 --> 01:21:20.974
- If you need anything let me know.
- I gotta use the bathroom.

01:21:21.367 --> 01:21:23.535
Hold it in, all right?
It's just 25 minutes before we're home.

01:21:23.535 --> 01:21:24.573
- I can't wait that long.
- Don't be ridiculous.

01:21:24.573 --> 01:21:25.678
Eddie go upstairs
and use the bathroom.

01:21:25.678 --> 01:21:29.061
I'm tired, I wanna go to sleep.
You couldn't go at Grandpa's.

01:21:29.061 --> 01:21:30.813
You had to wait till now?

01:21:31.232 --> 01:21:33.709
Come on, we're going.
We're going.

01:21:34.641 --> 01:21:36.188
Goddamnit.

01:21:37.728 --> 01:21:40.090
Bathroom’s all fucked up
because of construction,

01:21:40.090 --> 01:21:42.404
so, I’m gonna ask a neighbor.

01:21:42.499 --> 01:21:44.469
Dad, I don't wanna use a
neighbor's bathroom, I'm taking a shit.

01:21:44.469 --> 01:21:46.322
Have you ever seen
the show Good Times?

01:21:46.322 --> 01:21:46.941
No.

01:21:46.941 --> 01:21:49.812
You, actually, gonna like this.
This guy was the father on the show.

01:21:49.856 --> 01:21:52.533
- What? I don't care.
- I showed it to you.

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:56.741
He was in Coming to America.

01:21:56.916 --> 01:21:59.183
He’s probably sleeping,
I bet he's an old man.

01:21:59.445 --> 01:22:01.836
- Who is it?
- It's Howard, next door.

01:22:01.924 --> 01:22:03.716
I live in E.

01:22:06.437 --> 01:22:07.925
Hey, how are you?

01:22:07.925 --> 01:22:08.762
What's up?

01:22:08.762 --> 01:22:10.535
Unfortunately, my bathroom
is all fucked up.

01:22:10.535 --> 01:22:13.669
And this kid's gotta go.
Can we use yours for a minute?

01:22:14.123 --> 01:22:15.756
No, sorry.

01:22:16.567 --> 01:22:19.104
- What a, fucking, dickhead!
- Hey, stop that.

01:22:19.104 --> 01:22:20.646
He's a, fucking, legend.

01:22:22.672 --> 01:22:26.382
- Hello?
- Hi, I'm your neighbor.

01:22:26.711 --> 01:22:28.220
- Hey, how you doing?
- How are you?

01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:30.456
- I'm your neighbor, I never introduced myself.
- Allen, how are you?

01:22:30.456 --> 01:22:32.977
My bathroom is all fucked up
and my son needs to use.

01:22:32.977 --> 01:22:34.817
Can he use yours for a second?

01:22:35.129 --> 01:22:36.500
Is it number one,
or number two?

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:38.300
- One.
- He's gonna go one.

01:22:38.605 --> 01:22:40.814
All right? So, you go quick.
All right, on the back.

01:22:40.814 --> 01:22:42.793
I'll meet you in the hallway.

01:22:58.009 --> 01:22:59.393
Julia?

01:23:12.362 --> 01:23:16.444
Have a nice life, I hope you find
everything you're looking for.

01:23:54.549 --> 01:23:56.136
Yeah, I'm coming.

01:24:02.587 --> 01:24:03.978
Yeah.

01:24:09.606 --> 01:24:11.398
Come on, let's go.

01:24:22.226 --> 01:24:24.043
Who's the girl,
living in your apartment?

01:24:25.176 --> 01:24:26.079
What did you say?

01:24:26.079 --> 01:24:28.521
Yeah, that guy told me there’s some
hot chick living in your apartment.

01:24:28.521 --> 01:24:29.585
Who is that, mom?

01:24:29.585 --> 01:24:31.237
What were you doing,
talking to that coke-head?

01:24:31.237 --> 01:24:33.343
- He was talking to me.
- I told you to go in there and take a shit!

01:24:33.343 --> 01:24:35.402
- I did take a shit.
- That was it. Get on the elevator.

01:24:35.402 --> 01:24:36.695
It’s enough already!

01:24:39.773 --> 01:24:42.107
Don't talk about that to anybody.

01:24:58.953 --> 01:25:01.216
- Did you get what you needed?
- Yeah.

01:25:28.576 --> 01:25:31.342
Put the recycling in the garbage,
before you come in the house.

01:26:34.270 --> 01:26:35.929
Big day.

01:26:37.252 --> 01:26:40.058
Magnolia bakery,
from the downtown original.

01:26:40.289 --> 01:26:42.390
- Thank you.
- Did you have these? Delicious.

01:26:42.834 --> 01:26:45.758
You tell everybody here thank you so much
and they are welcome.

01:26:45.758 --> 01:26:48.102
- Will do.
- And these are on me, Howard Ratner.

01:26:48.549 --> 01:26:51.565
What's this?
This is the catalog for today?

01:26:51.565 --> 01:26:53.139
That's the one.

01:26:56.824 --> 01:26:58.901
- Stops right on me.
- Thank you.

01:27:03.450 --> 01:27:06.303
What, the fuck, is this?
This is a mistake.

01:27:06.446 --> 01:27:08.199
- That's a correction.
- No.

01:27:08.199 --> 01:27:10.344
It's a correction,
but it's a, fucking, mistake.

01:27:10.344 --> 01:27:11.994
Where is Anne,
I wanna speak with here.

01:27:11.994 --> 01:27:13.578
I'm sorry, Anne is in
a meeting right now.

01:27:13.578 --> 01:27:17.155
No, get her out of the meeting.
It's an emergency, I wanna speak with her.

01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:21.128
Call her on the phone, please.
Thank you.

01:27:22.729 --> 01:27:25.182
If you promise
to keep your voice down.

01:27:25.182 --> 01:27:26.755
- Yes.
- I'm happy to call her.

01:27:26.755 --> 01:27:29.127
Jesus, fucking, Christ!

01:27:30.641 --> 01:27:31.582
Hello, Anne.

01:27:31.582 --> 01:27:34.836
Can you ask how this
155 bullshit happened?

01:27:35.052 --> 01:27:36.436
Did you hear that?

01:27:37.547 --> 01:27:39.919
- Okay.
- What did she say?

01:27:40.872 --> 01:27:42.228
I'm afraid that's your appraisal.

01:27:42.228 --> 01:27:45.853
I know that's what it says,
I'm asking who came up with the, fucking, figure.

01:27:46.139 --> 01:27:48.831
- Oscar in Gems.
- Oscar is, fucking, wrong.

01:27:48.979 --> 01:27:51.985
I can go on and get
6 appraisers right now,

01:27:51.985 --> 01:27:54.917
5 of them would say
at least three thousand dollars a carat.

01:27:54.917 --> 01:27:57.215
- He is saying he can go to 6 appraisers...
- Give me the phone.

01:27:57.215 --> 01:27:59.656
Can I speak with her please?

01:27:59.796 --> 01:28:01.446
Look, I'm sorry,
but I have to hand you over.

01:28:01.446 --> 01:28:03.423
No, that wouldn't be necessarily,
I'd rather you didn't.

01:28:03.622 --> 01:28:04.835
- Anne.
- Yes.

01:28:04.835 --> 01:28:06.431
This is, fucking, outrageous.

01:28:06.431 --> 01:28:08.562
Okay, you need to
calm yourself down, Mr. Ratner.

01:28:08.562 --> 01:28:12.514
I don't wanna be calm.
This appraisal is a, fucking, joke.

01:28:12.514 --> 01:28:15.249
Oscar happens to be one of our most
experienced gemologists.

01:28:15.249 --> 01:28:17.728
Who, clearly, knows
nothing about colored stones.

01:28:17.728 --> 01:28:19.734
And why, the fuck,
am I hearing about it now?

01:28:19.734 --> 01:28:24.911
Do I need to remind you that you brought the opal to us
on a Friday night for an auction set on a Monday morning?

01:28:24.911 --> 01:28:27.785
- We were lucky to get appraised at all...
- I don't give a fuck. I don't care.

01:28:27.785 --> 01:28:29.065
It needs to be changed. Do it.

01:28:29.201 --> 01:28:31.288
That's not an option, but...
If you like we can pull it.

01:28:31.288 --> 01:28:34.259
Pull it? No, no.
We are not gonna pull it.

01:28:34.259 --> 01:28:35.718
Here's what you'll do.

01:28:35.718 --> 01:28:38.811
You gonna make an announcement
at the top of the auction.

01:28:38.958 --> 01:28:40.422
That the correction was wrong.

01:28:40.422 --> 01:28:42.401
- No, no.
- And the original estimate stands.

01:28:42.401 --> 01:28:46.656
We are not correcting a correction!
We can either pull it or carry on as is.

01:28:46.656 --> 01:28:48.660
- It's entirely up to you.
- Okay, thank you so much.

01:28:48.660 --> 01:28:51.059
- Okay, Anne, I'm sorry too.
- You know I have been...

01:28:51.191 --> 01:28:53.590
- We are done here, I had enough of this.
- Yes, that would be perfect, I'll let her know.

01:28:53.590 --> 01:28:56.606
Let who know? Me and my stuff
had to work the entire weekend...

01:28:56.606 --> 01:29:01.240
Okay, thank you so much Anne and I wanna say
from the bottom of my heart, I apologise.

01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:02.858
- Okay, I'll tell her, thank you.
- You understand?

01:29:02.858 --> 01:29:04.124
I can assure you, this is the last...

01:29:04.124 --> 01:29:09.955
So, she said that we need to take the
inserts out of each catalog

01:29:10.333 --> 01:29:14.268
before the auction starts,
so, you have those.

01:29:14.268 --> 01:29:17.703
If you want, I saw box down there,
and I can start on these.

01:29:21.749 --> 01:29:24.488
- What is that? What are you doing?
- I just have a question for Anne.

01:29:24.488 --> 01:29:26.219
You don't need to call her.
I just spoke with her.

01:29:26.219 --> 01:29:28.019
Oh, it's a simple question,
don't worry about it.

01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:28.794
Howard.

01:29:28.794 --> 01:29:30.899
Hi, Anne, he's saying
that you told him to...

01:29:30.899 --> 01:29:34.119
Okay, listen, just, fucking, put them
back in, I don't give a shit.

01:29:34.119 --> 01:29:35.808
- Gooey!
- We're here.

01:29:35.808 --> 01:29:37.834
You're sight for sore eyes.

01:29:37.834 --> 01:29:39.149
Is he here?

01:29:39.149 --> 01:29:41.858
KG? He is...
I didn't see him yet.

01:29:41.967 --> 01:29:44.589
Is he there?
I got all these things for him to sign.

01:29:44.589 --> 01:29:46.621
Listen to me, listen.
Do you want them?

01:29:46.621 --> 01:29:51.160
Get that before the auction starts.
Go to the auction, see if he's there.

01:29:51.160 --> 01:29:53.617
- He's a great guy, you'll love him.
- He's excited.

01:29:53.852 --> 01:29:55.876
I wanna ask you a little favor.

01:29:56.495 --> 01:29:57.987
What, what favor?

01:29:59.309 --> 01:30:01.427
I need you to jack up the bids.

01:30:02.289 --> 01:30:04.258
What? No, no.
Absolutely not.

01:30:04.408 --> 01:30:07.610
Gooey, a little bit, just here
and there you make a bid.

01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:10.462
I just gotta make sure
we get it up to 250.

01:30:12.127 --> 01:30:13.429
What if I win at 250?

01:30:13.429 --> 01:30:15.671
That's easy,
I'll give it right back to you.

01:30:15.671 --> 01:30:17.302
Jesus!

01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:20.576
This is not a really nice position
you put me in, you know?

01:30:20.576 --> 01:30:22.853
- I reset this. Very much.
- You think I wanna do this?

01:30:22.910 --> 01:30:26.879
I fucked up, I should've got
my own appraisal, but I didn't have the time.

01:30:27.185 --> 01:30:28.708
How much they appraised it for?

01:30:28.708 --> 01:30:30.425
- 200.
- 200?

01:30:30.425 --> 01:30:33.725
But these assholes,
they don't have an opal specialist.

01:30:33.776 --> 01:30:39.138
My guy at the AGL says 500,
just based of the pictures.

01:30:39.288 --> 01:30:43.437
Listen, 20 % I give you for the winning bidding.
You got to be a partner with me.

01:30:43.568 --> 01:30:46.035
KG is gonna buy it.
It's not a problem.

01:30:46.035 --> 01:30:48.146
This guy is obsessed with the stone.

01:30:48.727 --> 01:30:51.422
Today was supposed to be
about Aaron meeting KG.

01:30:51.904 --> 01:30:53.418
- Gooey.
- To show support.

01:30:53.418 --> 01:30:54.954
That's what today
was supposed to be about.

01:30:55.138 --> 01:30:57.791
This is support, this is support
like you've never known.

01:30:58.386 --> 01:31:00.542
Sold to you, thank you so much, sir.

01:31:01.784 --> 01:31:05.548
We move on now, ladies
and gentlemen, to lot number 38.

01:31:05.711 --> 01:31:09.290
Lot 38, we have a sale room notice.

01:31:09.780 --> 01:31:13.513
I’m required to inform you all
that this fine Ethiopian black opal,

01:31:13.513 --> 01:31:16.167
presented here before you all,
your left, my right.

01:31:16.305 --> 01:31:22.857
Is now offered with a revised estimate
of a 155 to 225 thousand US dollars.

01:31:23.390 --> 01:31:27.195
Ladies and gentlemen, it is a fine piece,
a collector's work.

01:31:27.344 --> 01:31:30.776
And, most importantly,
it is windowed on either side,

01:31:30.776 --> 01:31:36.729
to reveal the full spectrum of its dazzling
color and the pin-fire pattern within.

01:31:37.081 --> 01:31:41.043
So, with that in mind, ladies and gentlemen,
my colleagues are ready and poised on the phones.

01:31:41.043 --> 01:31:42.918
And you all ready with your paddles.

01:31:42.918 --> 01:31:46.153
We shall start the bidding now
at twenty thousand dollars.

01:31:46.175 --> 01:31:48.236
Twenty thousand now.
Thirty thousand.

01:31:48.236 --> 01:31:49.706
Do I have forty thousand now?

01:31:49.827 --> 01:31:52.813
Forty thousand, gentleman's bid.
Pleasure to see you, sir, thank you, sir.

01:31:52.813 --> 01:31:55.041
Forty thousand now.
Do I see fifty?

01:31:55.432 --> 01:31:57.619
Fifty thousand now.
A new place, thank you, sir.

01:31:57.619 --> 01:31:59.112
Pleasure to have you back too, sir.

01:31:59.298 --> 01:32:01.952
Fifty thousand now against you, sir.
Should we say sixty?

01:32:01.952 --> 01:32:05.308
Sixty thousand now against you, sir.
Seventy thousand now against you, sir.

01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:06.899
One hundred grand.

01:32:06.899 --> 01:32:10.137
One hundred thousand now!
Bid with you, sir.

01:32:10.137 --> 01:32:12.782
And a great place.
A big, bold, giant leap

01:32:12.901 --> 01:32:15.933
for a big, bold, giant leaper at
a hundred thousand dollars.

01:32:16.015 --> 01:32:18.257
No longer yours, sir.
It's against you, sir.

01:32:18.287 --> 01:32:21.642
I'm gonna try one more, sir.
I'll even break an increment for you, sir.

01:32:21.802 --> 01:32:24.578
Can I ask you to consider
a bid of 105 thousand, sir?

01:32:24.966 --> 01:32:26.505
Come on, sir. You sure?

01:32:27.072 --> 01:32:28.824
Positive? No farther?

01:32:28.999 --> 01:32:30.597
A defiant nod, then?

01:32:30.901 --> 01:32:34.316
Looking then for a 110 in the room.
It's a hundred thousand now.

01:32:34.945 --> 01:32:36.092
Is there any farther bidding?

01:32:36.092 --> 01:32:38.597
110 thousand now.
Welcome back, sir.

01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:40.804
110 thousand now.
Once again against you, sir.

01:32:40.804 --> 01:32:42.993
Should we try 120?
120 now.

01:32:43.549 --> 01:32:45.714
Try one more, sir.
Just try 130.

01:32:45.714 --> 01:32:46.747
130 now.

01:32:46.747 --> 01:32:49.720
Should we try 140?
140 thousand now.

01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:52.159
Come on, sir, it's up again, to 150.

01:32:52.462 --> 01:32:55.564
Try one more at a 150 thousand.
No longer yours, sir.

01:32:55.564 --> 01:32:58.102
Should we try 160?
160 now.

01:32:58.248 --> 01:33:00.149
Back against you again, sir.

01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:03.747
Can we try one more to a 170?
170 now.

01:33:03.869 --> 01:33:06.206
Say 180. Say 180, sir.

01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:07.732
You were okay down 175.

01:33:07.732 --> 01:33:10.003
180 thousand dollar now.

01:33:10.003 --> 01:33:13.553
Bid back against you, sir.
I'm looking for a 190 thousand.

01:33:14.595 --> 01:33:18.636
190 thousand dollars is bid.
Against you, sir.

01:33:18.636 --> 01:33:19.893
You have to bid to this claim.

01:33:20.021 --> 01:33:23.121
A 190 thousand.
Confer with your adviser now.

01:33:25.949 --> 01:33:27.831
- Seriously, we need to go.
- It's okay, I need this though.

01:33:27.918 --> 01:33:29.944
We gonna move this up any higher?
Any farther?

01:33:29.944 --> 01:33:32.998
- Relax, serious?
- It's a last chance for you, sir.

01:33:33.009 --> 01:33:36.205
I have to move this along,
we have a good bid at a 190 thousand.

01:33:36.597 --> 01:33:38.781
I'm looking for two hundred, sir.

01:33:40.133 --> 01:33:42.943
You gonna move this up any higher?
Any farther?

01:33:45.059 --> 01:33:46.374
You sure, sir?

01:33:46.535 --> 01:33:48.705
- Last chance, fair warning.
- Let's go.

01:33:48.987 --> 01:33:53.136
So, with you, sir, at a 190
thousand dollars against the phones.

01:33:53.235 --> 01:33:54.881
Against the rest of the room.

01:33:55.578 --> 01:33:58.448
Sold to you, sir,
at a 190 thousand dollars.

01:33:59.513 --> 01:34:01.560
Thank you so much.
Thank you, sir.

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.752
Panel 172.

01:34:11.196 --> 01:34:13.571
Gooey, I'm so, goddamn, sorry.

01:34:14.695 --> 01:34:15.996
Thank you very much.

01:34:16.384 --> 01:34:18.948
I'm sorry. Listen, I...

01:34:19.906 --> 01:34:22.181
Oh, this is 49th street.
Supposed to be on 48th street.

01:34:22.181 --> 01:34:23.421
Thank you.

01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:27.235
- That's a 190 grand, Howard.
- Yes, that's temporarily.

01:34:28.753 --> 01:34:32.212
I'm sorry.
I gotta tell you I was gonna stop...

01:34:32.212 --> 01:34:34.454
Didn't I tell you that
was gonna happen, Howard?

01:34:34.454 --> 01:34:35.821
- I'm sorry.
- So now what?

01:34:36.216 --> 01:34:39.995
So, your money gonna go into my account,
I'll wire it right back to you.

01:34:39.995 --> 01:34:42.951
- Including Adley’s 20%?
- Absolutely, that comes right out of my pocket.

01:34:42.951 --> 01:34:45.382
- That is nearly 38 grand, Howard.
- I know that.

01:34:45.940 --> 01:34:48.596
So, I'm gonna need a couple
of weeks on that. But it will be done.

01:34:48.596 --> 01:34:49.813
- I promise you.
- All right.

01:34:49.948 --> 01:34:52.571
- Aaron, let's go, come on!
- Dad, I got, like, 6 autographs.

01:34:52.571 --> 01:34:53.710
Now!

01:34:55.296 --> 01:34:56.842
You got the autographs, that's great.

01:34:56.842 --> 01:34:57.861
Yeah.

01:34:58.808 --> 01:35:00.231
Wasn't guy like a champ?

01:35:01.515 --> 01:35:03.247
- Don't be mad at me, please.
- Get in.

01:35:03.247 --> 01:35:04.625
Please don't be mad.

01:35:05.962 --> 01:35:08.435
Come on, can I get the opal?
Let me get the opal.

01:35:08.435 --> 01:35:10.915
- What for?
- Because I gotta sell that.

01:35:10.915 --> 01:35:13.140
- Take the fucking opal.
- Yes, all right, okay, thanks.

01:35:14.054 --> 01:35:16.193
Get them going.
Open the fucking door.

01:35:16.555 --> 01:35:18.154
What's he waiting for you for?

01:35:20.224 --> 01:35:21.308
All right.

01:35:23.611 --> 01:35:25.241
I know.

01:35:25.812 --> 01:35:27.694
Let them go
and then we'll talk.

01:35:28.364 --> 01:35:30.642
- What the fuck was that?
- All right, I fucked up.

01:35:30.719 --> 01:35:34.289
It was a mistake, all right?
I know, I admit it. I gotta...

01:35:35.373 --> 01:35:37.864
Just hit pause for one,
fucking, second.

01:35:37.864 --> 01:35:42.057
Gotta call Kevin, 'cause I know
he, fucking, wants it, you saw.

01:35:42.490 --> 01:35:47.734
He's got the 175 and then
everything will be copacetic, all right?

01:35:48.641 --> 01:35:51.560
KG, it's me.
I got great news for you.

01:35:52.950 --> 01:35:55.929
Hello?

01:35:56.414 --> 01:35:58.003
No one on the, fucking, phone!

01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:02.514
- If you just give me two, fucking...
- Get, the fuck, out.

01:36:02.927 --> 01:36:04.577
You're lucky there are
people around you, you prick.

01:36:04.577 --> 01:36:06.010
Come on, get out of here.
Let's go.

01:36:06.010 --> 01:36:07.772
Hey, fucking...

01:36:22.591 --> 01:36:24.574
Arno.

01:36:24.755 --> 01:36:27.070
Just listen to me, please.
I spoke...

01:36:27.675 --> 01:36:30.166
I spoke to Demany,
remember Demany?

01:36:30.166 --> 01:36:33.079
He's a business friend of mine.
He gave me the, fucking...

01:36:33.079 --> 01:36:35.476
That's enough, Howard!
That's fucking enough!

01:36:36.014 --> 01:36:37.953
Why are you being
so thickheaded?

01:36:39.318 --> 01:36:42.304
Fuck you man, suck my dick!
Throw him in the, fucking, water!

01:36:58.043 --> 01:36:59.878
Where, the fuck, are my glasses?

01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:46.812
I know this is a 400 dollar bag.
I'll give you 250.

01:37:46.812 --> 01:37:49.592
- Howard.
- Forget about Howard...

01:38:18.117 --> 01:38:20.167
- Howard, Justin is...
- I'm not feeling good.

01:38:20.167 --> 01:38:22.385
- Are you okay, what wrong with you?
- I won't work.

01:38:22.629 --> 01:38:24.746
- Send everybody home.
- All right, sweetie.

01:39:05.841 --> 01:39:08.000
Hey, sorry to bother you.

01:39:08.149 --> 01:39:09.240
What is it?

01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:11.622
I just wanted to see
how the auction went.

01:39:11.795 --> 01:39:14.899
Terrible, I don't wanna talk about it.

01:39:15.345 --> 01:39:19.685
Okay. Well, Damien and Joseph
brought this amazing sweat suit,

01:39:19.685 --> 01:39:22.561
that I think it would look so nice on you.
Do you wanna see it?

01:39:22.561 --> 01:39:24.260
Just leave me alone, please.

01:39:24.995 --> 01:39:26.902
Come on, Howard.

01:39:29.196 --> 01:39:31.821
- Don't look at me.
- Oh my God, Howard.

01:39:32.748 --> 01:39:35.196
- Don't look at me.
- What the fuck happened to you?

01:39:35.196 --> 01:39:36.821
Don't look at me, please.

01:39:41.420 --> 01:39:45.343
I don't know if I'm gonna make it.
I don't know. Everybody is...

01:39:45.542 --> 01:39:48.645
- It's not ever going right.
- I know.

01:39:49.254 --> 01:39:50.799
I'm so sad.

01:39:50.799 --> 01:39:54.305
I'm so fucked up.

01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:57.216
Yeah, I'm really upset too.

01:40:01.182 --> 01:40:05.700
I'm sorry if this has anything to do with me,
but I swear, I really didn't do anything.

01:40:05.700 --> 01:40:10.857
I wish you were nicer to me though.
It was not nice what you did to me.

01:40:11.288 --> 01:40:13.549
I tried, but it's really hard.

01:40:13.549 --> 01:40:15.876
I don't know what to do.

01:40:16.117 --> 01:40:19.520
I don't have any place to go.
I don't have anywhere to get.

01:40:19.871 --> 01:40:21.660
But you do.

01:40:21.839 --> 01:40:26.204
Like, really, Howard?
You're my home, you could come to me.

01:40:27.202 --> 01:40:30.109
I can't make it out.
I can't make it...

01:40:30.109 --> 01:40:31.502
What I am I supposed to do?

01:40:31.743 --> 01:40:36.018
Everything I do is not going right.

01:40:36.108 --> 01:40:39.229
I don't know what to do.
I, really, don't know anymore.

01:40:39.229 --> 01:40:40.995
Shit, I really don't...

01:40:40.995 --> 01:40:43.519
I gotta figure this out.

01:40:43.519 --> 01:40:45.102
I really do.

01:40:45.818 --> 01:40:48.901
I got something, if you want.
But you can't make fun of me.

01:40:49.498 --> 01:40:50.664
What?

01:40:52.299 --> 01:40:57.349
It's so stupid. I don't know.
I got it, I thought it would make you feel better.

01:40:57.715 --> 01:40:59.750
Look, unzip my skirt.

01:41:02.044 --> 01:41:04.357
Not like that,
just unzip my skirt.

01:41:08.329 --> 01:41:09.264
It says "Howie".

01:41:09.264 --> 01:41:11.817
What did you do?
Why would you do that?

01:41:11.817 --> 01:41:13.142
You don't like it?

01:41:13.142 --> 01:41:16.217
- I do, I'm not worth it.
- Yes, you are.

01:41:16.217 --> 01:41:18.003
- I'm not worth it.
- You are worth it.

01:41:18.003 --> 01:41:20.787
- Look. Howie, I'm so crazy about you.
- I don't deserve this.

01:41:20.787 --> 01:41:22.903
Yes, you do. I love you.

01:41:24.186 --> 01:41:27.378
- You can't even get buried with me now.
- It's okay.

01:41:31.453 --> 01:41:33.499
Oh, this, fucking, guy!

01:41:34.130 --> 01:41:36.533
Do not let him in,
understand me?

01:41:36.713 --> 01:41:38.913
Just ignore him.
Ignore him, Joey.

01:41:44.013 --> 01:41:45.555
Here, let's get you cleaned.

01:41:46.506 --> 01:41:49.157
It's not broken, right?
You don't think it's broken, right?

01:41:51.001 --> 01:41:54.458
This is crazy, you can't be
out here, looking like this.

01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:02.445
Help me answer that.

01:42:02.993 --> 01:42:03.762
Hello.

01:42:03.762 --> 01:42:07.615
Hi, this is Liz, I work with Kevin.
I'm actually, looking for a Howard.

01:42:07.757 --> 01:42:09.232
This is Howard.

01:42:09.232 --> 01:42:12.470
Hi, yes, I got your message
from Demany about the gem.

01:42:12.621 --> 01:42:14.016
We're at the bank right now.

01:42:16.438 --> 01:42:19.747
- Does he want it?
- Yes, Kevin still interested.

01:42:19.747 --> 01:42:20.690
We can actually...

01:42:20.690 --> 01:42:25.981
It's like we discussed, right?
It's still 175, right?

01:42:25.981 --> 01:42:27.971
- In cash.
- Yes, yes in cash.

01:42:27.971 --> 01:42:29.800
Like I said,
we're at the bank right now.

01:42:29.800 --> 01:42:31.737
Kevin, yes, I told you.

01:42:31.739 --> 01:42:33.159
- Howard, I gotta go.
- Okay.

01:42:33.293 --> 01:42:34.874
I'll see you soon, goodbye.

01:42:36.672 --> 01:42:38.855
See? I told you.

01:42:39.809 --> 01:42:42.253
Arno. Listen, no bullshit.

01:42:43.207 --> 01:42:45.943
Kevin Garnett is coming
to my office right now,

01:42:45.943 --> 01:42:49.178
with a 175 thousand dollars
cash, all right?

01:42:49.583 --> 01:42:53.312
You said I got till Monday?
Today is still Monday.

01:42:53.566 --> 01:42:56.638
I don't know if you're hearing this,
but, Arno, this is real.

01:42:56.638 --> 01:42:59.845
Kevin's really on the way,
he was just at the bank.

01:42:59.845 --> 01:43:01.343
Come get your money, buddy.

01:43:01.623 --> 01:43:02.929
I need the Celtic ring back.

01:43:02.929 --> 01:43:04.717
- What happened to Friday?
- I know, I know.

01:43:04.717 --> 01:43:06.796
- It's Monday, Howie.
- I know what we said.

01:43:07.149 --> 01:43:10.047
- It was a short week, Pesach...
- What happened to your face?

01:43:10.239 --> 01:43:12.487
Car accident, okay?

01:43:12.877 --> 01:43:13.999
- So listen to me.
- What do you need?

01:43:13.999 --> 01:43:17.309
I need the Celtic ring.
I'm gonna give you the Knicks ring.

01:43:18.097 --> 01:43:20.730
You know what that means
to me, swap them out, please.

01:43:20.906 --> 01:43:22.314
You've had this Knicks ring forever.

01:43:22.314 --> 01:43:24.369
I just need the Celtic ring back.

01:43:24.905 --> 01:43:26.777
- No, No.
- What do you wanna do?

01:43:27.268 --> 01:43:29.270
- I own that ring right now.
- I know, I know you do.

01:43:30.004 --> 01:43:33.825
I'll swap you the 2 rings,
but I'm gonna put a 15% vig on this one.

01:43:34.030 --> 01:43:36.751
And if you're not here by Friday,
it's gonna be the same thing all over again.

01:43:36.751 --> 01:43:38.662
- You're not gonna have a third ring.
- You don't have to worry about it.

01:43:38.729 --> 01:43:41.571
I'll make it 16%,
I'm sorry I fucked you up.

01:43:41.571 --> 01:43:43.312
Howie, what's going on?
Are you okay?

01:43:43.312 --> 01:43:45.483
I'm very good.
Everything's going good.

01:43:45.862 --> 01:43:47.641
I promise you.

01:43:53.263 --> 01:43:58.025
Hey, there he is!
KG, don't you got a game tonight?

01:43:59.011 --> 01:44:01.884
I got your chip right here.
Game night.

01:44:02.075 --> 01:44:03.613
- We really gotta go.
- You must be Liz.

01:44:03.613 --> 01:44:06.199
Yeah, we gonna make it
quick, absolutely.

01:44:07.224 --> 01:44:10.250
Julia, let's get
these guys some Powerades.

01:44:10.421 --> 01:44:12.861
Powerades? Water? Anything else?

01:44:13.203 --> 01:44:15.144
It's fine. I'm okay.
That's okay. Yeah, I'm good.

01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:17.850
Howard, let me get a
second with you, okay?

01:44:19.293 --> 01:44:21.808
Kevin, we need to be in Boston,
no more than 5 minutes.

01:44:21.808 --> 01:44:23.040
Give me 2 seconds.

01:44:23.322 --> 01:44:24.965
Kevin, we gotta be in Boston
in less than an hour.

01:44:24.965 --> 01:44:27.045
What's up with you man?
What the fuck is going on?

01:44:27.179 --> 01:44:30.246
Ever since I met you, you've been giving
me the rid around with everything.

01:44:30.246 --> 01:44:31.066
What do you mean?

01:44:31.066 --> 01:44:34.564
I feel like, you're, fucking, with my emotions,
you're just playing with me at some point.

01:44:34.564 --> 01:44:36.539
This hasn't been straight
since I came here.

01:44:36.589 --> 01:44:38.656
- You understand?
- Why are you saying that?

01:44:38.807 --> 01:44:40.994
Just one thing, you know,
I came back over here, I brought it back.

01:44:40.994 --> 01:44:43.630
Howard, I brought it back,
I didn't have to bring it back, you understand?

01:44:43.630 --> 01:44:45.825
I showed up at the auction,
you had somebody to bid against me.

01:44:45.825 --> 01:44:48.537
All these, fucking, games, like,
what, the fuck, are you doing man?

01:44:48.537 --> 01:44:51.256
Like, you don't think I noticed?
You think I know none of this?

01:44:51.262 --> 01:44:54.432
It's complicated, KG.
You see this face?

01:44:54.614 --> 01:44:55.760
Do you see it?

01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:58.033
Here's the 165 thousand
right there, cash.

01:44:58.033 --> 01:45:00.172
I'm showing you,
because this wasn't easy.

01:45:00.172 --> 01:45:02.728
Six percent goes to Demany.
I’ve already taken that out.

01:45:03.118 --> 01:45:04.225
I guess that's fair.

01:45:04.225 --> 01:45:06.473
Let me get the fucking opal, man.
Let me get the fuck out of here.

01:45:06.531 --> 01:45:07.534
- This opal.
- Yeah.

01:45:07.534 --> 01:45:09.517
- This opal is very valuable for you.
- Absolutely.

01:45:09.517 --> 01:45:10.903
Okay, I did that.

01:45:12.680 --> 01:45:15.795
I respect you.
I respect your passion.

01:45:15.795 --> 01:45:18.430
- Okay, I always had.
- I thought you were a fan too, man.

01:45:18.430 --> 01:45:19.921
I'm a fucking huge fan.

01:45:19.921 --> 01:45:21.344
What did you pay for this?
Real shit.

01:45:21.344 --> 01:45:22.402
What did you pay for this right here?

01:45:22.402 --> 01:45:24.674
That's not a fair question, Kevin.

01:45:25.101 --> 01:45:28.098
We're talking months
and months of, fucking, my time.

01:45:28.098 --> 01:45:30.303
I'm not gonna take the money back,
when I did a deal now.

01:45:30.633 --> 01:45:32.763
Straight up. Straight up me and you.
Mono mono.

01:45:33.396 --> 01:45:35.281
How much did you pay for this?

01:45:35.411 --> 01:45:38.097
What did I pay?
I paid... This is...

01:45:39.514 --> 01:45:43.341
I'm telling you, if I answer
that question it's very misleading.

01:45:43.341 --> 01:45:44.315
Why?

01:45:44.757 --> 01:45:47.617
- I paid a hundred grand.
- So you doubled your money.

01:45:47.735 --> 01:45:50.171
I'm the joker here, all right?
I got fucked.

01:45:50.171 --> 01:45:52.596
A million dollars is what
I was supposed to get.

01:45:52.887 --> 01:45:56.193
I get a, fucking, what?
Made 65 Gs?

01:45:56.475 --> 01:45:59.585
You gave some niggas, from Ethiopia,
a hundred grand for something,

01:45:59.585 --> 01:46:01.652
you thought was worth
a million dollars?

01:46:01.652 --> 01:46:02.846
You don't see nothing wrong
with that, Howard?

01:46:02.846 --> 01:46:05.404
Ethiopian miners, you know what these,
fucking, guys make?

01:46:05.708 --> 01:46:09.056
A hundred grand is fifty lifetimes
for these, fucking, guys.

01:46:09.056 --> 01:46:11.290
A million dollars is more,
that's my point, you understand?

01:46:11.438 --> 01:46:14.864
You wanna win by 1 point
or, fucking, 30 points, KG?

01:46:15.188 --> 01:46:18.978
Right? I see you out there,
when the, fucking, stadium's all booing you.

01:46:19.109 --> 01:46:21.586
You're 30 up, you're still going full tilt?

01:46:22.636 --> 01:46:25.390
Let’s see what Vegas...
What is Vegas got you guys at tonight?

01:46:25.489 --> 01:46:26.903
Take a look, let's see.

01:46:26.903 --> 01:46:28.819
Are you serious gonna
put this up right here?

01:46:28.819 --> 01:46:32.776
Look at this shit, the Sixers are supposed
to win the game tonight, they think.

01:46:32.848 --> 01:46:34.441
I don't keep a track of none of this shit.
Who give a fuck.

01:46:34.441 --> 01:46:37.698
They think on game 7
you're not gonna get, fucking, 18 points.

01:46:37.995 --> 01:46:39.880
They don't think
you gonna get 8 rebounds?

01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:41.072
These guys don't know
shit about me.

01:46:41.072 --> 01:46:42.338
What, the fuck, do they do?

01:46:42.338 --> 01:46:44.420
Doesn't that make you wanna,
fucking, kill them?

01:46:44.420 --> 01:46:46.861
Doesn't that make you wanna say
fuck you for doubting me?

01:46:47.350 --> 01:46:51.256
Doesn't that make you wanna step on,
fucking, Elton Brand's, fucking, neck?

01:46:52.079 --> 01:46:54.929
Come on, KG,
this is no different than that.

01:46:55.081 --> 01:46:58.254
This is me, all right?
I'm not a, fucking, athlete.

01:46:58.254 --> 01:47:01.042
This is my, fucking, way.
This is how I win.

01:47:02.010 --> 01:47:04.288
All the, fucking, hard work I do.

01:47:04.288 --> 01:47:07.175
All the, fucking, ass kicking,
and the dudes I pay.

01:47:07.311 --> 01:47:10.672
You're not gonna score
on a big one on game 7?

01:47:11.130 --> 01:47:15.013
Fuck these people, right?
That's how you feel, I know you do.

01:47:15.394 --> 01:47:16.740
So look...

01:47:18.984 --> 01:47:22.526
Let's, fucking, bet on this.
Let's bet on this shit.

01:47:24.472 --> 01:47:27.838
I'm, fucking, gonna bet
all this money on you tonight, KG.

01:47:28.258 --> 01:47:31.158
You are here to win, KG,
these fuckers don't know.

01:47:31.455 --> 01:47:34.708
Them out, fucking, west.
You think they, fucking, know you?

01:47:34.855 --> 01:47:36.894
They don't know you,
they don't know us.

01:47:37.415 --> 01:47:40.712
It's about, fucking, winning,
it's about you.

01:47:41.060 --> 01:47:43.801
I saw your, fucking, conviction,

01:47:43.964 --> 01:47:47.957
your, fucking, honesty
and your, fucking, magic.

01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:50.121
Howard, you're, fucking, crazy, man.

01:47:50.121 --> 01:47:54.029
KG, do you even understand how, fucking,
great of a game you gonna have tonight?

01:47:54.029 --> 01:47:55.345
- I know it.
- Listen.

01:47:55.345 --> 01:47:57.628
We're a team tonight, KG.

01:47:57.776 --> 01:48:02.942
That is, fucking, lock, it's a, fucking, feeling.
We both have it, they don't know.

01:48:03.225 --> 01:48:05.348
You and I know, all right?

01:48:11.876 --> 01:48:13.754
Nice, fucking, watch too.

01:48:15.453 --> 01:48:19.192
Hey, do you mind watching this place,
while I run to the bathroom?

01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:20.730
Thank you.

01:48:21.123 --> 01:48:22.746
 Can I leave you guys alone in here?

01:48:22.746 --> 01:48:24.873
- Go mind your business, sweetheart.
- Do you want company?

01:48:24.873 --> 01:48:27.634
I don't think so,
but next time maybe.

01:48:31.556 --> 01:48:33.322
Hey, hey!
I'm looking for Howard.

01:48:33.533 --> 01:48:35.320
I don't know where he is.
I'm fine. We're closed.

01:48:35.320 --> 01:48:36.596
He gave me a, fucking, fake Rolex.

01:48:36.723 --> 01:48:39.148
I have no idea about that, sir.
Please, come down.

01:48:39.148 --> 01:48:41.454
- Val, can you, please, open up?
- Let me talk to you about this.

01:48:41.629 --> 01:48:43.080
- You gotta help me.
- I'm sorry I'm leaving.

01:48:43.111 --> 01:48:45.898
This is gonna be one of the best
nights of our, fucking, life.

01:48:45.898 --> 01:48:48.095
Howard.

01:48:54.655 --> 01:48:57.310
Come on.

01:48:57.627 --> 01:48:58.661
Where are you?

01:48:59.112 --> 01:49:00.512
- Howard, what, the fuck, is going on?
- Take this.

01:49:00.512 --> 01:49:02.773
- What is this?
- I need you to listen to me carefully.

01:49:02.773 --> 01:49:07.063
I booked you on a Blade, okay?
You gonna land on top of the Mohegan Sun.

01:49:07.286 --> 01:49:10.592
There's a bet in that bag.
I want you to take all of it.

01:49:10.592 --> 01:49:13.315
All of it inside the bag
and place it on that bet.

01:49:13.315 --> 01:49:14.996
- How much is in the bag?
- It's a lot.

01:49:14.996 --> 01:49:17.103
 I don't want you to
think about that, all right?

01:49:17.103 --> 01:49:19.401
I don't even want you to look
at that, until you get there,

01:49:19.401 --> 01:49:21.754
and you take it out, and give it
to the teller, you understand me?

01:49:21.754 --> 01:49:22.667
Okay, I got it.

01:49:22.667 --> 01:49:25.156
I'm gonna fuck the living shit
out of you tonight, you know that?

01:49:25.156 --> 01:49:26.529
I wish I could kiss you.

01:49:26.772 --> 01:49:27.844
- You gotta go.
- Okay.

01:49:27.844 --> 01:49:30.159
- You get going.
- All right, love you, bye.

01:49:31.393 --> 01:49:32.398
Thank you, Jo.

01:49:34.878 --> 01:49:36.327
Good to see you, Josh.

01:49:40.965 --> 01:49:43.286
- All right, let's get this over with.
- Arno.

01:49:43.628 --> 01:49:46.134
- You never gonna believe this shit.
- Believe what?

01:49:46.134 --> 01:49:50.954
We are about to hit so, goddamn, big.
KG was just here, you saw him, right?

01:49:50.954 --> 01:49:52.215
I gave him the gem.

01:49:52.215 --> 01:49:55.055
He's gonna fuck up the money line
so bad tonight.

01:49:55.055 --> 01:49:56.669
Howard, where is the money right now?

01:49:56.963 --> 01:49:59.925
It's on the way right now.
It's on the way to the casino.

01:49:59.925 --> 01:50:02.389
What, the fuck, are you talking about,
Howard?

01:50:02.774 --> 01:50:05.012
- What, the fuck, is going on right here?
- Where is that girl?

01:50:05.111 --> 01:50:06.576
- The girl that went to the bathroom.
- I haven't seen her.

01:50:06.576 --> 01:50:08.186
- She didn't get back here?
- No.

01:50:08.186 --> 01:50:10.523
- What are you not getting?
- No, it's in this room right now.

01:50:10.607 --> 01:50:12.911
Go get her now, bring her back!

01:50:13.496 --> 01:50:15.478
- Hey, handsome, hit the buzz.
- Open the, fucking, door!

01:50:15.478 --> 01:50:17.517
Why, what am I
opening the door for?

01:50:17.517 --> 01:50:19.241
- Somebody, fucking, buzz me out.
- I got it, I got it.

01:50:19.241 --> 01:50:20.747
- What are they doing?
- Let's go. Let's go!

01:50:22.183 --> 01:50:24.263
- You're saying what?
- Put your hands off me!

01:50:24.360 --> 01:50:25.560
What, the fuck, are we doing?

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:28.040
It's gonna make sense
in about 2, fucking, minutes.

01:50:28.577 --> 01:50:30.502
- Listen to what I'm telling.
- I'm listening.

01:50:30.502 --> 01:50:31.655
You gonna do what
I tell you to do.

01:50:31.655 --> 01:50:34.163
Listen, you, fucking, goon,
I'm telling you something...

01:50:34.710 --> 01:50:35.990
Howard, listen to me!

01:50:36.393 --> 01:50:38.400
Arno!

01:50:40.720 --> 01:50:42.719
Get the, fucking, machine, now!

01:50:43.025 --> 01:50:43.911
Arno!

01:50:44.388 --> 01:50:46.363
- Shut the fuck up!
- What are you doing?

01:50:50.170 --> 01:50:51.760
Wait, hey, come on, come on!

01:50:54.752 --> 01:50:58.513
You want to get in touch with her?
I'll drop you on your fucking head, you hear me?

01:50:59.661 --> 01:51:01.968
- Okay, get me up.
- You gonna call her?

01:51:01.968 --> 01:51:04.905
- I'll call. I'll call. Please!
- You gonna get that bitch down here now?

01:51:04.905 --> 01:51:05.954
Take me up!

01:51:05.954 --> 01:51:08.682
All right, come one, get him up.
Get him up. Come on.

01:51:10.122 --> 01:51:11.711
Listen, listen to me.

01:51:11.964 --> 01:51:14.261
Pull yourself together, all right?

01:51:14.427 --> 01:51:16.914
I want you to make that call.
You hear me?

01:51:17.044 --> 01:51:17.770
Come on.

01:51:17.770 --> 01:51:20.001
Give me a, fucking, second. Please.

01:51:20.001 --> 01:51:21.971
You’ll have plenty of time,
after you make the call.

01:51:21.971 --> 01:51:23.044
My heart.

01:51:23.187 --> 01:51:26.161
Call this girl up.
I want her back here now.

01:51:30.263 --> 01:51:32.126
She's at Mohegan Sun.

01:51:32.513 --> 01:51:34.660
Come on, let's go.

01:51:35.312 --> 01:51:37.088
Put her on speaker.

01:51:40.399 --> 01:51:42.469
There you go.

01:51:45.210 --> 01:51:47.418
This motherfucker.
Real Bruce Wayne.

01:51:49.222 --> 01:51:51.107
Come on.

01:51:57.306 --> 01:52:00.122
- I can't. I'm sorry.
- Fucking guy, I can't believe.

01:52:00.122 --> 01:52:02.485
I'm sorry, I really am.
I am sorry.

01:52:08.004 --> 01:52:09.660
Fuck this!

01:52:10.267 --> 01:52:11.831
You're a moron.

01:52:12.373 --> 01:52:13.384
Fuck it.

01:52:13.384 --> 01:52:15.475
It's not worth it man,
put this shit away.

01:52:16.011 --> 01:52:17.047
- What are you doing?
- Buzz us out!

01:52:17.047 --> 01:52:19.101
What are you doing?
What am I buzzing?

01:52:19.101 --> 01:52:21.443
- Why are you...
- Just buzz me, the fuck, out!

01:52:21.443 --> 01:52:23.199
- Watch the, fucking, game?
- Buzz me, the fuck, out!

01:52:23.199 --> 01:52:25.217
- You'll be happy with the results.
- Buzz me out!

01:52:25.217 --> 01:52:28.034
I'm telling you now, before I put
your head through the, fucking, glass

01:52:28.034 --> 01:52:30.292
All right, I'll buzz you out.
I'll buzz you out.

01:52:34.224 --> 01:52:36.085
Close that door, man. Close it.

01:52:37.254 --> 01:52:38.697
Fuck, buzz me out!

01:52:40.738 --> 01:52:42.448
What are you doing?

01:52:42.448 --> 01:52:44.483
Open the, fucking, door!

01:52:47.412 --> 01:52:49.027
Howard, open the door.

01:52:50.752 --> 01:52:52.116
I'm sorry.

01:52:52.204 --> 01:52:54.037
I'm not buzzing you out.

01:52:54.037 --> 01:52:57.862
Arno, the Sixers
shouldn't even be there.

01:52:58.185 --> 01:53:01.241
No, she's at the
Mohegan Sun sports book.

01:53:01.407 --> 01:53:05.625
Mohegan Sun sports book.
Get over there now!

01:53:05.625 --> 01:53:07.785
You know what she,
fucking, looks like, go find her!

01:53:08.408 --> 01:53:09.989
Howard, open the door!

01:53:09.989 --> 01:53:12.449
- I know you're upset, Arno.
- Of course, I'm upset!

01:53:12.449 --> 01:53:15.020
I'm trying to, fucking,
make this all work for you.

01:53:15.193 --> 01:53:20.386
The NBA doesn't want the Sixers to win,
there's no money in that, you understand?

01:53:20.386 --> 01:53:22.881
The refs know that.
They want stars...

01:53:22.881 --> 01:53:25.294
Buzz us, the fuck, out of here,
Howard. Right now!

01:53:25.580 --> 01:53:27.837
Open the door! Open it now!

01:53:27.854 --> 01:53:31.097
This is, fucking, bulletproof,
you only gonna hurt yourself.

01:53:31.211 --> 01:53:32.981
- That doesn't work.
- I'm telling you to open it!

01:53:32.981 --> 01:53:35.309
Arno, I'd duck,
you're gonna get killed.

01:53:35.572 --> 01:53:39.139
Listen to me. Thank you...
I'm talking to Arno.

01:53:39.308 --> 01:53:41.478
- Enough of you! Enough!
- You gotta open this, fucking, door.

01:53:41.478 --> 01:53:43.155
Listen to me.

01:53:43.155 --> 01:53:46.066
You realize all he's gotta do is
get the opening tip,

01:53:46.066 --> 01:53:47.515
- he's gotta get the, fucking...
- buzz this, fucking...

01:53:47.515 --> 01:53:51.346
We gonna get, you know how many
rebounds this guy's gonna get, Arno?

01:53:51.532 --> 01:53:53.501
Who is that?
Who are you talking to?

01:53:53.501 --> 01:53:56.017
Who'd you call?
Who did you call?

01:53:56.712 --> 01:53:58.846
Open the, fucking, door, dick!

01:54:10.780 --> 01:54:12.525
- Yeah?
- Yeah, it's me.

01:54:12.525 --> 01:54:13.518
Make it quick, 'cause...

01:54:13.518 --> 01:54:16.632
- ConEd called, the office, there's a, fucking, leak.
- What leak?

01:54:16.632 --> 01:54:20.901
There's a gas leak on Pinoak.
So they are evacuating the whole block.

01:54:20.901 --> 01:54:23.343
- Just slow down, okay?
- So get the kids out of there, all right?

01:54:23.343 --> 01:54:25.610
- You and the kids go to Amy’s.
- Well, why would they call the office

01:54:25.610 --> 01:54:26.765
- Stay at Amy's.
- and not the...

01:54:26.765 --> 01:54:28.721
I don't know why they
called, me, all right?

01:54:28.721 --> 01:54:29.852
That's not making any sense, Howard.

01:54:29.852 --> 01:54:31.550
I'm not here to argue with you!

01:54:31.621 --> 01:54:35.256
Dinah, get the kids out of the house,
I'm frightened, okay?

01:54:35.309 --> 01:54:37.476
- You're freaking me out.
- Just get out, go to Amy's.

01:54:37.476 --> 01:54:39.574
And do not leave there,
until I get home.

01:54:40.061 --> 01:54:42.336
- You promise me? Stay at the house.
- Okay.

01:54:42.336 --> 01:54:43.610
- Okay?
- You'll meet us there?

01:54:43.610 --> 01:54:45.758
Yes. All right, thank you.
Thank you.

01:54:45.969 --> 01:54:47.739
Open the, fucking, door!

01:54:47.987 --> 01:54:50.321
Last year, I made a 125 million dollars.

01:54:50.486 --> 01:54:52.223
I don't even know what to do
with my money anymore.

01:54:52.223 --> 01:54:56.087
I got nobody to spend it with,
nobody to enjoy my life with anymore, it’s horrible.

01:54:56.569 --> 01:54:58.569
Today is the big day to be, I thank you.

01:54:59.370 --> 01:55:01.173
You wanna have a drink with me
when we get there?

01:55:32.728 --> 01:55:34.017
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:55:34.017 --> 01:55:39.112
Okay, so I'm betting on the Celtics,
parlay, three-way,

01:55:39.112 --> 01:55:40.885
money, I don't know, plus...
Have here, you just...

01:55:41.115 --> 01:55:42.704
So you wanna parlay, three-way...

01:55:42.704 --> 01:55:44.960
Make sure that one you put in
it's exactly that, okay?

01:55:44.960 --> 01:55:46.461
I will, how much you want on it?

01:55:46.461 --> 01:55:49.034
Okay, I'm not really sure,
You just gonna have to.

01:55:49.953 --> 01:55:52.080
Okay. Chad?

01:55:52.197 --> 01:55:54.795
Okay, just give me a minute.
I just have to get my supervisor

01:55:54.959 --> 01:55:56.787
- count this, okay?
- Okay.

01:55:59.184 --> 01:56:00.946
- We're almost there.
- One second.

01:56:19.036 --> 01:56:20.934
Come on. Let's go.

01:56:21.919 --> 01:56:24.376
I'm feeling this.

01:56:26.196 --> 01:56:27.395
Beautiful.

01:56:27.395 --> 01:56:30.012
From Bergen County, Number 5.

01:56:30.012 --> 01:56:31.994
This is it.

01:56:31.994 --> 01:56:34.975
Kevin Garnett!

01:56:35.077 --> 01:56:37.155
Hi, tell me.

01:56:39.044 --> 01:56:42.729
Okay, listen, listen. Say it.
Say the whole ticket out loud.

01:56:42.729 --> 01:56:45.041
I want you to say it really loud.
Give me a second.

01:56:45.041 --> 01:56:48.014
I want some people to hear it, all right?
Hang on. Hang on.

01:56:48.383 --> 01:56:49.963
Say the whole ticket.
Go ahead.

01:56:50.126 --> 01:56:54.928
I put 155 on the three-way bet.
Garnett’s points plus his rebounds.

01:56:55.097 --> 01:56:58.917
Celtics money line with
the Celtics to win the opening tip.

01:56:59.046 --> 01:57:01.981
Right, just read the whole ticket.
Read the whole ticket.

01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:04.395
Okay, so it says here...

01:57:04.476 --> 01:57:06.494
- You're having a good time?
- Yes.

01:57:06.518 --> 01:57:10.069
1 million 229 thousand.

01:57:10.069 --> 01:57:11.679
Did you fucking hear that number?

01:57:11.679 --> 01:57:13.769
That's enough.
You don't have to say anymore.

01:57:13.827 --> 01:57:15.582
The bet's in.

01:57:15.582 --> 01:57:16.649
- Okay?
- Fuck you!

01:57:16.649 --> 01:57:19.751
I'm taking you to the, fucking,
the Ritz-Carlton in the Grand Cayman.

01:57:19.766 --> 01:57:21.804
All right? With the, fucking, jacuzzi.

01:57:22.004 --> 01:57:24.266
- All right. Rob that tattoo for me.
- Okay, I love you.

01:57:25.695 --> 01:57:26.918
Okay, here we go.

01:57:27.196 --> 01:57:30.560
We grab this tip, and
we're in business, boys, all right?

01:57:31.315 --> 01:57:33.466
Pound that chest, baby!
This is it.

01:57:33.739 --> 01:57:35.563
We gotta get this.
This is right out of the gate.

01:57:35.735 --> 01:57:36.851
Right out of the gate.

01:57:37.364 --> 01:57:39.710
Come on.

01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:44.689
Get that tip, let's go
get that, fucking, tip.

01:57:45.340 --> 01:57:46.801
Get that tip.

01:57:47.144 --> 01:57:48.671
Let's go.

01:57:52.302 --> 01:57:55.451
Get that! Yes! Yes!

01:57:55.783 --> 01:57:58.214
Fuck, we would've been fucked,
if he didn't get that.

01:57:58.342 --> 01:58:01.798
That was the, fucking, biggest part
of the whole, goddamn, parlay right there.

01:58:01.798 --> 01:58:03.014
That was huge.

01:58:03.014 --> 01:58:05.780
I knew he was gonna win that.

01:58:06.244 --> 01:58:08.323
All right, that's it.

01:58:12.554 --> 01:58:14.326
That’s one!
That’s, fucking, one.

01:58:14.326 --> 01:58:15.515
Look at that.

01:58:15.592 --> 01:58:17.532
Right out of the, fucking, gate.
The man.

01:58:17.658 --> 01:58:19.559
The man's feeling the gem!

01:58:20.367 --> 01:58:21.934
Go, get it, get it to him.

01:58:22.866 --> 01:58:24.937
Go. Go.
Finish it. Finish it.

01:58:26.006 --> 01:58:27.937
Yes, all right, that's, fucking, it.

01:58:28.033 --> 01:58:31.182
That's the first shot of the game.
He, fucking, did it. That's 3 now.

01:58:31.571 --> 01:58:34.496
Two plus, that, fucking, rebound.
That’s 3 of the 26!

01:58:34.556 --> 01:58:36.384
Okay, I bet on...

01:58:36.565 --> 01:58:39.115
I bet on the Celtics,
specifically, Kevin Garnett.

01:58:39.248 --> 01:58:43.977
Okay, 2 good bets: Celtics are winning
and Garnett's got 9 and 7, so...

01:58:44.517 --> 01:58:48.098
That's 16 right now
on the way to 26 you said, right?

01:58:48.115 --> 01:58:50.221
- The gorgeous one is here.
- Not even half time yet.

01:58:50.221 --> 01:58:52.043
Twice in one day, I can't believe it.

01:58:52.043 --> 01:58:53.669
How are you?
From the helicopter to here.

01:58:53.816 --> 01:58:56.267
How are you doing, baby?
I can't kick you out of my mind.

01:58:57.758 --> 01:58:58.522
You're funny.

01:58:58.657 --> 01:59:00.419
Hi, baby, you're, definitely, hot.

01:59:00.764 --> 01:59:02.589
What, you got money on the Celtics?

01:59:02.969 --> 01:59:04.545
- Let me see, baby.
- Is he gonna shoot?

01:59:05.718 --> 01:59:07.696
Come on, Garnett,
that one's gonna happen.

01:59:07.696 --> 01:59:10.906
Oh, come on, man, I mean,
so he missed a shot, who cares?

01:59:12.035 --> 01:59:14.022
I have a great idea
for the halftime, okay?

01:59:14.142 --> 01:59:15.899
- What's that?
- I'd like you to come up to my room.

01:59:15.899 --> 01:59:19.235
I hired the chef, I'm at penthouse A.
And I got the... It's gorgeous.

01:59:19.637 --> 01:59:22.043
Best views, I mean, who can
ask for more than that?

01:59:22.123 --> 01:59:24.723
- Thank you.
- I love you, baby, I'll see you there.

01:59:24.981 --> 01:59:27.338
- Okay, yes, got it.
- Penthouse A, The PennyRoyal.

01:59:29.154 --> 01:59:30.725
Okay, bye.

01:59:30.725 --> 01:59:31.449
Wow.

01:59:31.449 --> 01:59:33.554
- Fucking worst.
- He's like a cartoon.

01:59:35.707 --> 01:59:37.042
You okay?

01:59:39.539 --> 01:59:40.589
What happened?

01:59:46.961 --> 01:59:47.836
I gotta go.

01:59:47.836 --> 01:59:51.337
- What's going on, you need help?
- Thank you so much for your help.

02:00:07.926 --> 02:00:11.030
This is the beauty of betting.

02:00:11.152 --> 02:00:11.914
You know?

02:00:11.914 --> 02:00:14.585
I'm, fucking, pulling for the Celtics.
The Knicks fan.

02:00:15.338 --> 02:00:18.865
If the, fucking, 12 year old version
of me saw me right now,

02:00:18.865 --> 02:00:20.066
he's be like "what the fuck"?

02:00:20.123 --> 02:00:22.778
Everybody's talking
about this, fucking, big bet.

02:00:23.835 --> 02:00:25.224
So it's gotta be her.

02:00:25.496 --> 02:00:29.517
He's with me, we're gonna, fucking,
find her and bring her back, boss.

02:00:30.038 --> 02:00:32.233
Boss, absolutely.

02:00:32.233 --> 02:00:35.802
I need everyone in here
to lock in KG.

02:00:36.058 --> 02:00:37.452
Look at KG!

02:00:37.743 --> 02:00:41.426
Remember this:
if you wanna go quickly - do it alone,

02:00:42.004 --> 02:00:45.719
but if you wanna
go far - you do it together!

02:00:46.191 --> 02:00:48.827
We're like roaches.
And you can't kill us.

02:00:48.864 --> 02:00:50.617
Quit, fucking, passing.
Give it to him.

02:00:51.131 --> 02:00:52.230
And another, and another.

02:00:52.230 --> 02:00:54.297
And shoot. Shoot. Shoot.

02:00:54.907 --> 02:00:57.312
Fuck that shit!
Fucking Doc!

02:00:58.153 --> 02:01:00.992
Fucking, threw his rhythm off,
it took him out of the game.

02:01:01.430 --> 02:01:03.951
Fuck, man!
That's your fault!

02:01:04.618 --> 02:01:06.791
You see that other guy?
Yo, Phil.

02:01:06.917 --> 02:01:10.085
What, your boys from Boston?
You got some boys in Boston?

02:01:10.408 --> 02:01:11.947
You'll see them locked on, hang on.

02:01:12.563 --> 02:01:15.438
This fucker, is that
one of your boys, that fat fuck?

02:01:15.469 --> 02:01:17.894
Looks like you.
Looks like one of your boys.

02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:23.322
That a, fucking, rebound!
That's it, 3 more!

02:01:23.519 --> 02:01:25.125
Three more. Way to go!

02:01:25.270 --> 02:01:27.442
What does it say up there,
what is the score?

02:01:27.847 --> 02:01:28.823
Are we winning?

02:01:28.823 --> 02:01:31.594
They’re winning.
They’re winning by 3 points.

02:01:31.594 --> 02:01:33.559
Fuck that shit!
He, fucking, fouled.

02:01:33.974 --> 02:01:35.883
Doesn't matter,
he grabbed it, he had it.

02:01:36.167 --> 02:01:38.617
That counts as 1.
What are we at, 23?

02:01:41.166 --> 02:01:43.007
All right, last possession.
Let's go.

02:01:43.007 --> 02:01:45.712
Good, pick it up.
All right. That's it. That's it.

02:01:45.868 --> 02:01:49.494
Shoot that shit!
Come on K, shoot it, shoot it!

02:01:53.394 --> 02:01:56.741
Holy fuck! Yeah!
Let's, fucking, do it!

02:01:57.751 --> 02:01:59.911
Just, fucking...
That's all the gem.

02:02:00.227 --> 02:02:01.513
That's all the gem.

02:02:02.976 --> 02:02:05.719
We're at 25 now. One more!

02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:10.441
One more, fucking point,
either a rebound, or a, fucking, basket.

02:02:10.616 --> 02:02:13.213
Anything.
Either one and we, fucking, got this.

02:02:14.426 --> 02:02:16.543
All right, one more.
We just need one more.

02:02:17.303 --> 02:02:18.642
- Oh my God.
- Hi.

02:02:18.642 --> 02:02:21.478
Come on in.
Three times in one day.

02:02:21.756 --> 02:02:23.144
- I know, I know.
- Unbelievable.

02:02:23.411 --> 02:02:25.332
And I said that...
I believe it's you.

02:02:25.332 --> 02:02:27.718
- Where's your boyfriend?
- Why don't we watch the game?

02:02:27.718 --> 02:02:29.866
Go ahead, sit there,
make yourself comfortable.

02:02:30.234 --> 02:02:31.975
Where's the remo,
what do I do?

02:02:31.975 --> 02:02:35.014
The iPad is over there,
do what you gotta do with the iPad.

02:02:35.018 --> 02:02:37.533
I gotta take a shower, okay?
I really need gotta take a shower.

02:02:37.533 --> 02:02:39.332
I gotta clean up, okay?
To get myself washed.

02:02:39.629 --> 02:02:42.105
That plane ride,
it got me all messed up.

02:02:42.348 --> 02:02:45.532
So what I want you to do.
If that door bell rings, okay?

02:02:45.875 --> 02:02:49.668
I got my friends, okay, coming in,
or I got the food coming, okay?

02:02:49.668 --> 02:02:51.094
You just answer and let them in.

02:02:51.094 --> 02:02:53.533
- Okay. All right.
- Okay, baby? Please.

02:02:57.965 --> 02:02:59.566
That's it!

02:03:00.804 --> 02:03:02.853
Thank you.

02:03:03.590 --> 02:03:05.590
That's it, okay? That's 2 done.

02:03:06.732 --> 02:03:08.436
We got that. Two.

02:03:08.436 --> 02:03:11.434
We just gotta win now.
Celts gotta win and we're, fucking, done.

02:03:11.434 --> 02:03:13.117
We're done, Arno.

02:03:15.650 --> 02:03:17.535
What do you got?
What's the score, baby?

02:03:17.607 --> 02:03:20.817
- 68/73, Boston.
- 68 what in the 4th?

02:03:21.741 --> 02:03:23.932
You wanna call down
and just cancel the, fucking, food.

02:03:23.932 --> 02:03:25.360
I wanna go out.

02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:27.523
Baby, I love that
you’re into this game.

02:03:38.613 --> 02:03:39.845
Push that.

02:03:39.845 --> 02:03:41.210
Push it!

02:03:41.210 --> 02:03:41.875
Go!

02:03:41.879 --> 02:03:44.427
Go to the, fucking, hole.
Get in, KG, get in!

02:03:44.557 --> 02:03:46.026
Oh, don't, fucking, miss that!

02:03:46.026 --> 02:03:48.308
Don't miss that.
That's all right.

02:03:48.667 --> 02:03:51.978
That's all right.
KG is gonna get this, fucking, shot.

02:03:52.518 --> 02:03:53.840
That's how you steal shit.

02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:55.472
Sink that shot.

02:03:55.610 --> 02:03:56.832
Sink it.

02:03:57.119 --> 02:03:57.821
Come on, feel it.

02:03:57.821 --> 02:03:59.800
Feel it.

02:04:00.072 --> 02:04:01.550
Come on, he's got the gem.

02:04:01.840 --> 02:04:04.001
He's got the gem.
Feel that, fucking, gem.

02:04:04.001 --> 02:04:05.799
Feel it.

02:04:12.057 --> 02:04:14.366
Fuck.
It's all right, it's all right.

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:17.100
All right. We're up enough.
We're up enough.

02:04:17.426 --> 02:04:19.031
This is not that big of a deal.

02:04:19.094 --> 02:04:21.253
This, fucking, helps seal it,
but we're good.

02:04:21.762 --> 02:04:24.109
Don't talk, just, fucking,
do your shit, man.

02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:26.315
Do your shit.

02:04:28.149 --> 02:04:30.153
Get this shit, come on.

02:04:32.487 --> 02:04:34.370
Yeah!

02:04:37.875 --> 02:04:40.025
I'm confident now.
I'm confident.

02:04:40.682 --> 02:04:43.113
Don't let them shoot that.

02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:45.844
Get that!
Yes!

02:04:46.660 --> 02:04:48.100
Oh my God!

02:04:48.201 --> 02:04:49.580
Yeah!

02:04:50.432 --> 02:04:51.801
Oh my God!

02:04:53.494 --> 02:04:54.614
Holy shit!

02:04:55.589 --> 02:04:56.680
Holy, fucking, shit!

02:04:57.405 --> 02:04:58.565
Oh my God!

02:05:00.531 --> 02:05:01.531
Oh my God!

02:05:04.622 --> 02:05:06.952
Howard? Did we just win?

02:05:07.025 --> 02:05:09.775
Oh my, fucking, God!
Are you kidding me?

02:05:10.162 --> 02:05:12.093
Oh my God!

02:05:12.447 --> 02:05:13.512
Holy shit!

02:05:13.779 --> 02:05:14.705
I love you, baby.

02:05:14.763 --> 02:05:17.436
I love you.

02:05:18.530 --> 02:05:23.856
I love you.

02:05:25.246 --> 02:05:26.606
Arno!

02:05:26.804 --> 02:05:30.162
He, fucking, did it.

02:05:31.079 --> 02:05:32.606
He, fucking, did it.

02:05:33.243 --> 02:05:35.380
I know. I know, thank you.

02:05:35.657 --> 02:05:37.489
Thank you.

02:05:37.569 --> 02:05:39.544
No, you, you.
I love you.

02:05:39.544 --> 02:05:42.095
I love you.
I'm so happy, it's, fucking...

02:05:42.406 --> 02:05:44.594
It's going down.

02:05:45.129 --> 02:05:47.131
- Arno.
- You won, you made your point. Let's go.

02:05:47.131 --> 02:05:48.177
All righty.

02:05:48.553 --> 02:05:50.756
Okay, listen.
Yes.

02:05:51.460 --> 02:05:53.261
You just cash that in, okay?

02:05:53.261 --> 02:05:56.035
And make sure they,
fucking, walk you into the car.

02:05:56.557 --> 02:05:58.407
All right?
I’m gonna book you a Blade.

02:05:58.407 --> 02:06:00.584
- Howard.
- All right, I'll call you back.

02:06:00.584 --> 02:06:02.506
- Son of a bitch.
- Arno?

02:06:02.805 --> 02:06:04.625
- I can't, fucking, believe.
- I did it, Arno.

02:06:06.818 --> 02:06:08.328
What, the fuck, did you just do?

02:06:11.477 --> 02:06:13.512
Shut up!
Get me bags now!

02:06:15.250 --> 02:06:17.188
Let go off me.
Shut, the fuck, up!

02:06:17.466 --> 02:06:19.455
Or you'll wind up next to him,
you hear me?

02:06:19.629 --> 02:06:21.263
Don't, fucking, confuse me though.

02:06:23.896 --> 02:06:25.528
Take your hands off me right now!

02:06:25.954 --> 02:06:28.025
Go ahead!

02:06:28.578 --> 02:06:31.075
Do it!
What did I say? Do it!

02:06:32.699 --> 02:06:34.678
I want out of here.
Let me out of here!

02:06:35.406 --> 02:06:36.505
Let me out!

02:06:37.608 --> 02:06:40.282
Go get the bags, now!
I'll fix this.

02:06:43.148 --> 02:06:44.714
- Get off me.
- Stay right there!

02:06:44.714 --> 02:06:46.034
Stay right, fucking, there!

02:06:47.058 --> 02:06:48.508
Come on, let's go!

02:06:55.099 --> 02:06:57.286
Get out!
Get the fuck out!

02:07:05.291 --> 02:07:08.999
You are heading to the finals.
How are you feeling?

02:07:09.164 --> 02:07:11.604
When you win,
it’s all that matters, you know.

02:07:11.742 --> 02:07:13.967
The big quiet,
the big shut up, you know.

02:07:14.641 --> 02:07:16.318
To them doubters,
to them haters.

02:07:16.318 --> 02:07:17.914
Bring it in.

02:07:17.914 --> 02:07:19.452
Get that, motherfucking, money, right?

02:07:19.620 --> 02:07:20.913
And a personal one to you blood.

02:07:20.913 --> 02:07:25.004
You just celebrated your 36th birthday,
to everyone who's saying you're too old...

02:07:25.167 --> 02:07:26.329
Some strong shit!

02:07:27.227 --> 02:07:29.966
That's my nigga right there!
Look at that motherfucker, man!

02:07:30.381 --> 02:07:32.381
I know him! I know that guy!
I know him!

02:07:33.390 --> 02:07:35.536
My dad sold a ring to him!

02:07:35.672 --> 02:07:39.046
Hey, I can't think!
Amy, he was naked in the trunk.

02:07:39.443 --> 02:07:40.933
I'm calling the police.

02:07:41.123 --> 02:07:45.308
All the dues, and everything I put into this.
You might think that I will show up to game 7.

02:07:46.144 --> 02:07:47.274
Yeah, that's a joke.

02:07:52.512 --> 02:07:54.206
It's all there.
Thank you.

02:08:07.769 --> 02:08:10.356
In the end, I felt like
it was me and the rock.

02:08:10.490 --> 02:08:11.647
Nothing else.

02:08:22.562 --> 02:08:25.148
Oh my God, Wayne.
Thank you so much.

02:08:25.148 --> 02:08:26.702
- My pleasure.
- Thank you.

02:08:27.338 --> 02:08:29.326
Listen, I want you to come here,
and I'll have one drink.

02:08:29.326 --> 02:08:31.616
No. I gotta go.
Bye, baby.

02:08:31.616 --> 02:08:33.523
- I gotta go.
- Let's go down for one drink.

02:08:33.747 --> 02:08:35.058
We can go now.

02:08:35.679 --> 02:08:38.122
Nico, go in the back.
I got it.

02:08:38.550 --> 02:08:39.745
Let's go.

02:08:40.268 --> 02:08:41.142
Go! Go!

02:08:41.142 --> 02:08:42.623
On the, fucking, cameras.

02:08:43.215 --> 02:08:44.267
All right. Go! Go!

02:08:44.751 --> 02:08:45.771
Okay, I got you.

02:08:47.108 --> 02:08:49.072
- Nico?
- I can't find the cameras!

02:08:49.373 --> 02:08:51.154
Make you get all those in the trunk.

02:08:51.978 --> 02:09:13.133
