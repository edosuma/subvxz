37:24.784 --> 37:26.615
He may be in custody...

37:26.786 --> 37:28.822
...but that just means there's
another psycho right around the corner.

37:28.997 --> 37:32.160
I've been here working every night
and I still have to do more.

37:32.334 --> 37:34.325
You can't allow yourself to get caught.

37:35.837 --> 37:39.079
Combing through police blotters
at your desk every night?

37:39.257 --> 37:41.634
Peeling back the sides of a bus
in broad daylight?

37:41.801 --> 37:44.793
Speeding into a crowded bar?
You're ﬁxated on being a hero...

37:44.971 --> 37:47.257
...not paying attention
to who might be watching.

37:47.432 --> 37:50.970
-ls this your idea of a pep talk?
-lt's not my identity that's at risk.

37:51.144 --> 37:53.806
Every day, I have to run
faster and faster interference...

37:53.980 --> 37:55.811
...on these Good Samaritan reports.

37:55.982 --> 37:57.688
ltjust means I'm doing my job.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.946
Just have to make sure
no one sees my face.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.480
Well, you can't be sure of that
unless you plan to put on a mask.

38:06.701 --> 38:07.861
You're joking, right?

38:09.371 --> 38:11.282
You are not in Smallville anymore, Clark.

38:11.706 --> 38:14.288
Metropolis has millions of people
walking the streets...

38:14.459 --> 38:16.541
...every one of them
watching for a miracle.

38:17.087 --> 38:19.544
To change their lives, to give them hope.

38:19.923 --> 38:22.335
You are that miracle.

38:22.926 --> 38:26.168
And it's just a matter of time
before someone discovers that.

38:28.682 --> 38:30.047
I'll be more careful.

38:33.895 --> 38:35.726
Hey, Clark.

38:36.731 --> 38:40.815
Perfect. None of your fellow comrades—
They don't wanna give me the time of day.

38:40.986 --> 38:44.945
But you look like you're a
thinking-outside-of-the-box kind of guy.

38:45.573 --> 38:46.733
Um.

38:47.575 --> 38:51.159
There's, uh, a mystery hero
roaming the streets of Metropolis.

38:51.663 --> 38:55.406
Scout's honor. Out of nowhere,
these tires come ﬂoating through the air.

38:58.128 --> 38:59.493
Slow down.

38:59.671 --> 39:02.003
Olsen. James Olsen,
photographer, Daily Planet.

39:02.173 --> 39:05.882
Well, James, uh, adrenaline
can play strange games with a person.

39:07.012 --> 39:10.300
Ha, ha. Oh, no, no, he's— He's real.

39:10.473 --> 39:11.553
I know it.

39:11.725 --> 39:14.057
I hope you're right.
We could use the help.

39:16.521 --> 39:17.852
When you get some hard evidence...

39:18.023 --> 39:20.685
...l'll be more than glad
to continue this conversation.

39:22.819 --> 39:23.854
Evening, Mr. Olsen.

39:24.946 --> 39:26.527

39:32.787 --> 39:35.620
I'm gonna prove that this guy exists, C.K.

39:39.919 --> 39:41.580
He's out there.

40:11.493 --> 40:13.324
You look a little uncomfortable.

40:14.329 --> 40:18.493
-You're not a lawyer.
-l'|l take that as a compliment.

40:19.334 --> 40:21.416
Congratulations on your Page 1.

40:25.673 --> 40:28.506
It's nice to have your work recognized...

40:28.676 --> 40:32.919
...after so many years
being the good little boy in the shadows.

40:33.848 --> 40:36.510
You have more admirers than you think.

40:37.352 --> 40:42.346
My boss, Miss Mercer, has been gathering
a small group of talent, if you're game.

40:42.524 --> 40:45.311
You've read my list of accomplishments.

40:45.527 --> 40:48.815
-l'm not interested in sharing top billing.
-Cut the bravado.

40:48.988 --> 40:51.024
You didn't commit all those murders.

40:51.616 --> 40:55.279
You're just a copycat
looking for attention.

40:56.162 --> 40:57.698
Cops haven't found this yet...

40:57.872 --> 41:02.115
...but we have security footage of you
at an arcade during one of the crimes.

41:02.502 --> 41:06.620
It's a crime I'm sure you've studied
if you were looking to mimic the real killer.

41:07.966 --> 41:11.049
You remember the nun at Saint Vincent's,
crushed to death.

41:11.970 --> 41:15.337
That surveillance time code must
have been wrong, because that was me.

41:15.515 --> 41:16.675
Really?

41:17.892 --> 41:21.635
Then I suppose you can tell me
where her missing onyx cruciﬁx is.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.225
The one on the rosary.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.440
You didn't kill her.
