00:49.162 --> 00:52.287
An inca tern.

00:52.826 --> 00:54.378
The scoundrel abruptly takes up

00:54.414 --> 00:56.483
birdwatching, and
within a month, he spots

00:56.600 --> 00:59.858
the first inca tern in
all of North America!

00:59.975 --> 01:02.576
I wouldn't have believed it
had I not been there myself.

01:02.764 --> 01:04.670
And you just know
he's going to wring

01:04.733 --> 01:06.725
every last drop
out of this discovery.

01:06.769 --> 01:09.178
Oh, he'll wring
everything out of it.

01:09.365 --> 01:12.623
Lectures, books, guided tours,

01:12.686 --> 01:16.373
You name it, he will wring it.
He claims Josephine Dawson

01:16.443 --> 01:18.428
suddenly agreed to
a birdwatching date.

01:18.553 --> 01:22.615
Josephine Dawson, with him?!

01:22.858 --> 01:24.275
Rose-breasted Grosbeak!

01:24.358 --> 01:28.068
Oh, a fine example, plumlee!

01:28.295 --> 01:31.318
I dare say I caught a glimpse
of it a hair before you even.

01:31.373 --> 01:35.125
Nonsense. I'm putting it
in my life list.

01:35.211 --> 01:39.351
June 17th, 7:45 A.M.
Rose-breasted Grosbeak.

01:39.429 --> 01:41.959
We can both put it in
our life lists, my good man.

01:42.062 --> 01:46.130
Only I'll mark my
sighting down for 7:44 A.M.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.796
You are a devil.

01:50.445 --> 01:52.437
Ooh! What is this fellow...?

01:52.531 --> 01:56.173
Oh, dear.

02:03.164 --> 02:05.828
Well, this was
no hunting accident.

02:06.358 --> 02:08.966
This is Alistair Plumlee
and Gilford Harrison.

02:09.125 --> 02:12.867
The two were set to testify
against Rex Grey next week.

02:13.078 --> 02:16.060
These are the men who witnessed Mr. Grey
shoot his business partner last month?

02:16.179 --> 02:18.374
Well, two of the three
witnesses. I daresay

02:18.414 --> 02:20.523
their timely deaths
are no accident.

02:20.617 --> 02:22.937
Sir, we've been unable
to find anything.

02:23.002 --> 02:26.382
The gunman hasn't left so much as a
footprint behind. Thank you, George.

02:26.507 --> 02:28.439
And apparently we
don't have much to go on.

02:28.554 --> 02:30.695
Once I get the bodies
to the morgue, hopefully

02:30.773 --> 02:33.296
I can provide more specifics.

02:33.513 --> 02:36.828
Sir. The Rex Grey case...

02:36.968 --> 02:38.937
Doesn't that belong
to station three?

02:39.054 --> 02:40.968
Crown prosecutor Daniels
turned it over to me.

02:41.020 --> 02:43.585
Unfortunately, I've had
no more luck than they did.

02:43.734 --> 02:46.648
Best do our darnedest to keep
the last witness safe I suppose.

02:46.742 --> 02:49.242
That's precisely what
I was thinking, George.

02:49.382 --> 02:51.529
And I can think of
no one better suited

02:51.564 --> 02:54.445
for this important
task than you.

02:55.023 --> 02:56.476
Thank you, sir.

02:56.640 --> 02:58.328
I'll do whatever I can
to keep our prized witness

02:58.371 --> 03:00.749
Safe over the weekend.

03:01.734 --> 03:03.546
Who is he, exactly?

03:05.478 --> 03:07.335
Roger Newsome?

03:07.480 --> 03:10.695
Of the mimico Newsomes.

03:11.289 --> 03:13.421
George Crabtree.

03:13.671 --> 03:15.705
An entire weekend together...

03:16.597 --> 03:18.570
At last!

03:20.261 --> 03:24.820
I trust somebody will
transport these for me?

03:39.382 --> 03:42.757
Sir, I am begging you
to assign another constable.

03:42.827 --> 03:46.030
Surely you can set aside your history
with Mr. Newsome for the weekend.

03:46.062 --> 03:48.069
Sir, too much
history has accrued.

03:48.171 --> 03:50.414
While investigating
his auto club

03:50.507 --> 03:53.484
He ignored my pleas for help
as I was being strangled.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.624
I was having the life
throttled out of me

03:55.679 --> 03:58.257
and he ran off in abject
cowardice. Not to mention

03:58.328 --> 04:00.315
the grief he caused while
we were investigating

04:00.350 --> 04:02.914
his golf club
and his puzzle club.

04:03.078 --> 04:04.914
George, you have overcome

04:04.992 --> 04:07.390
far greater challenges
during your time here.

04:07.457 --> 04:10.132
Sir, I honestly
don't believe that I have.

04:10.328 --> 04:13.328
I really think
my hatred for Mr. Newsome

04:13.367 --> 04:16.498
is such that should
the killer try to kill him,

04:16.533 --> 04:19.471
my subconscious could
overtake my ability

04:19.565 --> 04:21.183
to prevent such an incident.

04:21.269 --> 04:23.671
I would be complicit
in his murder

04:23.707 --> 04:26.038
against my will. Sir,
You would have to arrest me.

04:26.225 --> 04:28.608
The concession
I've made is this.

04:29.397 --> 04:31.813
Henry will assist you
to help ease the burden.

04:31.874 --> 04:34.999
Higgins? Sir, you're taking me out of
the pot and putting me in the fire.

04:35.366 --> 04:37.350
I might as well
watch Newsome on my own.

04:37.538 --> 04:40.121
Crown prosecutor Daniels has
authorized the three of you

04:40.157 --> 04:43.038
to stay at the windsor house
hotel ahead of the trial.

04:43.217 --> 04:46.127
I will be nearby to make
sure your subconscious

04:46.163 --> 04:48.569
doesn't get the best of you.

04:49.381 --> 04:51.303
Sir.

04:56.206 --> 04:59.616
The air was still
damp with mist.

04:59.944 --> 05:03.561
My shaded spectacles shielding
me from the morning sun.

05:03.788 --> 05:06.014
We had been out
for an hour already

05:06.069 --> 05:08.583
and observed nothing more
than a decrepit old blue Jay

05:08.618 --> 05:13.368
with a crooked beak. I forged
ahead toward the marsh,

05:13.618 --> 05:15.423
where ever so faintly,

05:15.525 --> 05:17.559
I heard a cat-like...

05:21.290 --> 05:23.071
Harrison and Plumlee Missed it.

05:23.259 --> 05:25.540
As though it were
meant for me alone.

05:25.669 --> 05:28.587
I raised my binoculars

05:28.900 --> 05:30.337
and there she was.

05:30.470 --> 05:34.375
The inca tern in all her glory,
moustache and all.

05:34.517 --> 05:36.544
Wow. It must
have been beautiful.

05:36.618 --> 05:38.939
I got as near as I could
to take photographs.

05:39.243 --> 05:43.071
Photographs that prove I spotted
the only known inca tern

05:43.165 --> 05:45.376
In all of north America.

05:45.603 --> 05:48.384
I shall be renowned in
ornithology circles.

05:48.579 --> 05:50.087
Revered, even.

05:50.298 --> 05:53.243
I only wish I had more time
with the great beauty.

05:53.439 --> 05:55.493
Yes, but you were
interrupted by a murder.

05:55.681 --> 05:58.833
Oh yes, that. Of all mornings

05:58.892 --> 06:01.626
for Rex Grey to act upon
his murderous impulses.

06:01.821 --> 06:03.771
I'm surprised you're
so disMissive, Newsome.

06:03.853 --> 06:06.899
All the reasons why your
fellow birdwatchers were killed.

06:06.961 --> 06:09.744
They're equally as
applicable to you.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.446
I suppose I am
in danger, aren't I?

06:12.719 --> 06:15.461
You'll be safe with us.
Let's get to the hotel.

06:16.686 --> 06:19.157
But if the constabulary
had more evidence,

06:19.222 --> 06:21.133
you wouldn't require
my testimony?

06:21.196 --> 06:23.977
Well, we don't. We don't have
so much as a murder weapon.

06:24.086 --> 06:25.960
So don't think you're
going to weasel

06:26.032 --> 06:28.571
your way out of testifying.
What if I...

06:28.665 --> 06:31.477
You liar! You bloody liar, you!

06:31.563 --> 06:34.227
Hey, hey, hey! Get back, sir!
Shame on you, Mr. Newsome!

06:34.274 --> 06:35.876
Shame, shame, shame!

06:35.915 --> 06:39.772
The shame is all yours
for those dreadful trousers.

06:40.079 --> 06:42.235
I'll get the better
of you, Roger.

06:44.610 --> 06:47.461
Off you go,
little Stanley Faber!

06:47.547 --> 06:48.852
What's that all about?

06:48.930 --> 06:52.633
Oh, nothing,
not even worth the breath.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.860
Did you see those trousers?

07:04.071 --> 07:06.993
Dr. Ogden, Miss James.
What have you?

07:07.170 --> 07:09.344
Given the calibre of
the bullets used, I believe

07:09.406 --> 07:11.540
these men were shot
from some distance

07:11.586 --> 07:13.574
Using a precision rifle.

07:13.735 --> 07:16.141
Forty-five calibre?
Indeed, detective.

07:16.290 --> 07:18.379
Both bullets were in almost
almost the exact same spot

07:18.415 --> 07:21.711
in their chests, suggesting they
were shot in quick succession.

07:21.813 --> 07:24.805
The second victim hardly had time to
move after the first one was shot.

07:24.907 --> 07:28.180
Which is in line with my
suspicion. Rex Grey has hired

07:28.250 --> 07:31.273
a trained killer
to eliminate the witnesses.

07:36.367 --> 07:38.533
Not up to my usual
standards to be sure,

07:38.568 --> 07:41.765
but I suppose I can endure.

07:42.117 --> 07:43.500
It's not a vacation,
Mr. Newsome.

07:43.593 --> 07:46.281
Oh please, call me Roger.

07:46.421 --> 07:49.484
Are we not well-enough
acquainted by now, George?

07:49.687 --> 07:52.421
No, we aren't, and I don't
think we ever will be.

07:52.640 --> 07:54.351
You can call me Henry.
I don't mind.

07:54.476 --> 07:58.640
Why thank you, Henry.
I shall, Henry.

08:01.578 --> 08:04.968
So, what are we going
to do this evening?

08:05.319 --> 08:06.562
We're going to ensure
that Mr. Newsome

08:06.587 --> 08:07.732
doesn't come to any harm.

08:07.833 --> 08:11.302
Yes, but what do we do
while we do that?

08:11.685 --> 08:13.966
Nothing, I suppose. "nothing"?

08:14.388 --> 08:17.419
Roger Newsome does not do
"nothing" on a Friday evening.

08:17.646 --> 08:21.052
If we are confined
to this... Room,

08:21.216 --> 08:23.435
we might at least
host a dinner party.

08:23.779 --> 08:25.763
Absolutely not.
Nobody's supposed to know

08:25.794 --> 08:28.036
where you are, Roger.
That's the whole point.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.859
You called me Roger.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.996
Have you told anybody
that you're here?

08:34.825 --> 08:36.910
Well, I could
hardly just disappear.

08:39.724 --> 08:42.177
- Ruthie!
- Oh, Roger!

08:44.986 --> 08:48.471
May I present my sister, Ruth
Newsome, of the esteemed...

08:48.502 --> 08:50.416
Of the MiMico Newsome's.

08:50.471 --> 08:53.392
Roger is so thrilled to be
joining the constabulary.

08:53.439 --> 08:56.377
So I just, well, I had to come
and see what it was all about.

08:56.446 --> 08:58.767
He hasn't "joined" the
constabulary, Miss Newsome.

08:58.854 --> 09:02.713
Ruth, this is constable
Crabtree. The bright, young,

09:02.814 --> 09:06.127
unmarried constable
I was telling you about.

09:06.486 --> 09:08.213
And what about this one?

09:08.486 --> 09:09.916
Yes, that's constable Higgins,

09:10.017 --> 09:14.275
But constable Crabtree is
my dear friend. A top chum.

09:14.392 --> 09:16.236
Miss Newsome, you have to leave.

09:16.299 --> 09:18.939
And I implore that you not tell
anybody your brother's location.

09:19.010 --> 09:21.275
- Unhand me, you brute!
- Ruth!

09:21.463 --> 09:23.744
Constable Crabtree is
merely doing his job.

09:23.947 --> 09:26.088
I'm sure if I arrange
for the two of you

09:26.142 --> 09:28.666
to socialize in a more
casual setting you will

09:28.713 --> 09:31.963
- see what a fine gentleman he is.
- Newsome, that's enough, thank you.

09:32.064 --> 09:33.783
Oh heavens, Roger. No, no, no.

09:33.932 --> 09:37.096
You must promise me you'll get a haircut
before your presentation this weekend.

09:37.259 --> 09:40.189
- You really look a fright.
- Yes, I know.

09:40.330 --> 09:44.101
I promise!

09:46.304 --> 09:49.627
- Goodbye, constable Higgins.
- Miss Newsome.

09:51.853 --> 09:53.596
Miss Newsome.

09:54.564 --> 09:56.064
What presentation?

09:56.139 --> 09:59.307
Well I'm to present
my inca tern findings

09:59.361 --> 10:01.250
to the ornithology
community this weekend.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.719
You are not to leave this room
until the trial, Mr. Newsome.

10:03.821 --> 10:06.305
But I've already booked the
hall and sent invitations.

10:06.330 --> 10:08.860
- All the top birders will be there!
- All the top birders

10:09.079 --> 10:10.633
will have to wait.

10:18.014 --> 10:20.897
I know what you're
trying to do, Mr. Grey.

10:21.506 --> 10:23.045
You have a trained killer

10:23.100 --> 10:25.132
on the outside
trying to eliminate

10:25.194 --> 10:29.639
all of the witnesses that agree
to testify against you.

10:31.412 --> 10:33.280
That's news to me.

10:33.811 --> 10:36.844
I am going to find this
gunman, and when I do,

10:36.880 --> 10:38.912
I'll establish a link to you.

10:39.334 --> 10:42.149
And you'll be held responsible
for not one murder

10:42.233 --> 10:43.782
but three.

10:45.267 --> 10:48.055
And if you don't find him?

10:48.532 --> 10:51.642
Is that an adMission
that you hired the gunman?

10:52.001 --> 10:54.681
No. Of course it isn't.

10:54.868 --> 10:57.477
But if you let me out of here,

10:57.618 --> 10:59.493
I'll ask around for you.

10:59.665 --> 11:01.903
Make your job a little easier.

11:02.524 --> 11:05.071
I know you've had
trouble with my case,

11:05.243 --> 11:06.634
Detective.

11:07.751 --> 11:08.665
You're never going to see

11:08.720 --> 11:11.913
the streets of Toronto again.

11:17.548 --> 11:20.600
- I have an idea.
- What's that?

11:20.842 --> 11:23.023
Let me borrow your uniform.

11:23.242 --> 11:24.238
Why?

11:24.320 --> 11:28.226
So I can go for
a haircut, in disguise.

11:28.554 --> 11:30.687
The killer would never
shoot a constable.

11:30.836 --> 11:32.340
You'll not be giving
a bird presentation,

11:32.422 --> 11:34.984
Newsome. So you needn't
worry about your hair.

11:35.398 --> 11:36.804
Well,

11:36.987 --> 11:40.081
I can no sooner go to court
looking like this!

11:40.566 --> 11:43.628
As soon as Rex Grey is in a penitentiary,
you can have all the haircuts you want.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.620
Until then, nobody
cares about you

11:45.683 --> 11:48.050
Or your hair,
just your testimony.

11:55.276 --> 11:57.625
I'm hungry.

11:59.776 --> 12:01.526
I suppose it is that time.

12:01.598 --> 12:03.901
I'll get our dinner.
Thank you, George.

12:03.987 --> 12:06.628
Oi, Higgins, I'm off
to get our supper.

12:06.769 --> 12:09.170
Alright.
Make sure he doesn't leave.

12:09.237 --> 12:11.405
Alright.

12:25.659 --> 12:27.269
Henry,

12:27.423 --> 12:29.423
I'm going for a haircut.

12:31.427 --> 12:33.661
Bye.

12:41.839 --> 12:45.039
Henry?

12:45.095 --> 12:47.602
Yes, detective?

12:48.556 --> 12:50.063
Where's George?

12:50.134 --> 12:53.610
He went to get supper, sir.
And took Mr. Newsome with him?

12:53.688 --> 12:55.681
Yes. No!

12:55.790 --> 12:59.329
Roger must have gone out
for a haircut, sir.

12:59.602 --> 13:01.255
He's left the building?!

13:10.487 --> 13:12.665
Sir, there he is.

13:20.204 --> 13:23.657
Henry. The balcony.
The shooter! Sir.

13:24.134 --> 13:26.743
Mr. Newsome, get down!

13:27.106 --> 13:29.740
Mr. Newsome, get down!

13:32.065 --> 13:33.735
Get up, get up!

13:33.875 --> 13:37.255
Gunshots, get down!

13:39.748 --> 13:42.342
Mr. Newsome, are you hit?
No, I'm alright.

13:42.482 --> 13:45.951
Thank heavens. I merely
wanted a haircut.

13:46.035 --> 13:50.076
Yes, well...
Ruth said my hair...

13:50.217 --> 13:53.560
I merely wanted a haircut
before my presentation.

13:54.084 --> 13:55.529
Inca tern...

14:02.982 --> 14:04.771
Tell George...

14:05.232 --> 14:07.521
I had a bird's eye view.

14:08.725 --> 14:09.777
Bird's...

14:09.802 --> 14:11.861
Eye...

14:12.428 --> 14:15.196
No. View.

14:15.514 --> 14:17.889
No, no. Mr. Newsome!

14:30.693 --> 14:32.107
<i>Bird's eye view?</i>

14:32.193 --> 14:35.883
Thats right. He said, "tell
George I had a bird's eye view."

14:36.023 --> 14:37.695
I'm sorry, I can't
imagine what that means.

14:37.836 --> 14:40.883
Well, he was dying, perhaps
it was simply a delusion.

14:41.070 --> 14:43.836
Tell me we have something,
detective.

14:45.978 --> 14:48.195
I am terribly sorry,
Mr. Daniels,

14:48.230 --> 14:50.764
But the shooter got away
without a trace.

14:50.886 --> 14:53.175
Again?! You're telling me

14:53.225 --> 14:54.964
He left nothing behind for us?

14:55.037 --> 14:57.449
Sir, he is meticulous.

14:57.495 --> 14:59.214
A professional, if you will.

14:59.292 --> 15:01.902
It was going to be difficult
enough to prosecute Mr. Grey

15:01.933 --> 15:05.178
without the murder weapon. Now I
don't have any witnesses, either.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.535
Mr. Newsome was
a pain in the neck,

15:09.589 --> 15:12.105
But I wish he'd survived.

15:13.501 --> 15:15.501
What if he had?

15:16.017 --> 15:18.064
Had what?

15:18.673 --> 15:21.689
Survived. What if
he was still alive?

15:21.907 --> 15:25.017
What in heavens are you talking about? You
just told me the man died in your arms.

15:25.056 --> 15:26.853
But at this point,

15:26.909 --> 15:29.415
No one else knows that.

15:29.548 --> 15:32.892
W-W-What if we created
the illusion that Mr. Newsome

15:32.970 --> 15:34.958
survived the shooting
and was still

15:35.009 --> 15:37.790
determined to testify
against Mr. Grey?

15:37.954 --> 15:41.423
How does that help me? I can't
put a corpse on the stand.

15:41.526 --> 15:45.572
No, but if we present him
all about town as if he is

15:45.634 --> 15:48.611
still alive, perhaps the killer
will try to kill him again.

15:48.673 --> 15:51.673
Exactly. If we
can catch the killer,

15:51.759 --> 15:55.329
in the process of trying
to re-kill Mr. Newsome,

15:55.431 --> 15:58.743
then perhaps we can force him
to testify against Mr. Grey.

15:58.884 --> 16:01.257
You want to parade a dead man
around town in hopes

16:01.282 --> 16:04.290
that his murderer tries
to murder him again?

16:04.845 --> 16:06.454
Yes.

16:08.243 --> 16:11.461
Well it's mad,
but if you can get perMission

16:11.497 --> 16:15.198
from his next of kin,
give it a try.

16:17.269 --> 16:20.136
George, perhaps you can get
perMission from his next of kin.

16:20.172 --> 16:23.373
Sir, might I suggest that
request come from Henry Higgins?

16:23.408 --> 16:25.408
Newsome's sister took
quite a liking to him.

16:25.444 --> 16:28.428
Very well. Perhaps Henry will

16:28.475 --> 16:31.521
embrace the opportunity
to redeem himself.

16:32.037 --> 16:34.417
Let me begin by saying
how very sorry I am

16:34.453 --> 16:36.786
for your loss, Miss Newsome.

16:36.959 --> 16:40.740
I will Miss him dearly.
But I am glad

16:40.834 --> 16:45.248
he got to fulfill his desire to
be a constable in his last days.

16:45.607 --> 16:47.430
Yes. Actually,

16:47.466 --> 16:50.107
there is more he can do
to help the constabulary.

16:50.287 --> 16:51.654
How do you mean?

16:51.787 --> 16:54.873
Well, Miss Newsome,
with your perMission

16:55.107 --> 16:56.904
we would like to try

16:57.170 --> 16:59.225
to bring Roger back to life.

16:59.402 --> 17:02.029
Resurrect him, if you will.
So he may continue to help us

17:02.054 --> 17:04.761
with our case against Rex Grey.
The plan would be

17:04.849 --> 17:06.560
to try to fool...
oh, thank heavens!

17:06.631 --> 17:09.248
Oh, yes, yes, yes,
of course I permit!

17:09.279 --> 17:11.592
- I-I most certainly permit!
- Well, that was easy!

17:11.678 --> 17:15.058
I get my beloved Roger back!
You can revive him!

17:15.154 --> 17:17.394
- When may I see him?
- Wait now, Miss Newsome...

17:17.429 --> 17:18.748
My darling brother!

17:18.810 --> 17:21.115
Roger and I will grow
old together after all.

17:21.161 --> 17:23.248
- Hold on, Miss Newsome... - and you!

17:23.451 --> 17:26.912
I can't thank you enough for
this great gift, Henry Higgins.

17:27.154 --> 17:28.334
The gift of life.

17:28.402 --> 17:31.006
Oh! I think you must
have misunderstood

17:31.041 --> 17:33.435
what I'm trying to
ask you, Miss Newsome.

17:33.725 --> 17:36.514
You see, ro...

17:36.967 --> 17:38.358
You see,

17:38.576 --> 17:40.917
Roger is indeed dead.

17:41.428 --> 17:44.688
We cannot literally
bring him back to life.

17:44.865 --> 17:48.725
- No?
- No. That's impossible.

17:48.990 --> 17:51.494
We would merely like
to pretend he's alive

17:51.530 --> 17:54.324
- in order to catch his killer.
- Pretend?

17:54.668 --> 17:56.355
Oh.

17:56.965 --> 17:59.469
So, may we have your permission

17:59.504 --> 18:01.471
to present Roger around
town as if he were alive?

18:01.506 --> 18:04.965
It... really is our best hope
to catch his killer.

18:05.222 --> 18:07.215
You're going to take
Roger out in public?

18:07.535 --> 18:09.011
Yes.

18:10.425 --> 18:11.910
I have one condition.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.652
I don't believe I've given
anyone a haircut before.

18:15.738 --> 18:17.113
It's quite fun.

18:17.300 --> 18:19.449
And I've never applied
makeup to a corpse.

18:19.535 --> 18:21.658
You could moonlight as
a mortician, Miss James.

18:21.863 --> 18:23.808
Between this and my studies,
I'm doing more than enough

18:23.856 --> 18:26.863
Moonlighting. I should think,
I can almost see

18:26.902 --> 18:29.399
the life returning to
his cheeks, Miss James.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.405
William, where do you
get your hair cut?

18:35.440 --> 18:38.041
I don't believe you have ever
mentioned going to the barber.

18:38.143 --> 18:40.909
Oh, it's nowhere special.

18:41.049 --> 18:43.596
Surely the barber shop
has a name.

18:44.229 --> 18:46.409
I can't recall.

18:46.846 --> 18:49.986
You, William Murdoch, the man
who remembers everything,

18:50.252 --> 18:52.557
can not recall where
he has his hair cut?

18:52.651 --> 18:54.724
No, I don't.
I prefer to use my mind

18:54.760 --> 18:56.750
for more important things.

18:56.859 --> 19:00.929
Alright. I was just curious.

19:01.211 --> 19:03.390
Well, I feel as though
I'm being interrogated, Julia.

19:03.418 --> 19:05.672
and I feel as if
I'm being lied to.

19:05.820 --> 19:08.390
Dr. Ogden, is that enough Rouge?

19:08.507 --> 19:11.404
Ah! A touch more, Miss James.

19:14.420 --> 19:17.247
Perhaps you cut your
own hair, is that it?

19:17.521 --> 19:19.916
No. It is, isn't it?

19:20.029 --> 19:22.052
No, it isn't. It would be

19:22.087 --> 19:25.615
tremendously difficult
to get the back even.

19:26.076 --> 19:27.123
Perhaps,

19:27.255 --> 19:29.466
your hair simply doesn't grow.

19:29.728 --> 19:31.974
You've never been to the barber.

19:34.075 --> 19:37.951
- Mrs. Kitchen.
- Mrs. Kitchen, the landlady?

19:38.263 --> 19:40.420
I return to my boarding house

19:40.499 --> 19:43.755
every other Wednesday at lunch
to have my hair cut.

19:47.201 --> 19:50.560
Well, now that I'm an expert,

19:50.810 --> 19:52.505
perhaps you'll
allow me next time?

19:52.571 --> 19:54.671
Oh, no, thank you.

19:54.863 --> 19:58.224
Then I would be without an
excuse to have her beef stew.

19:58.826 --> 20:00.630
The truth emerges.

20:01.677 --> 20:02.959
There.

20:03.029 --> 20:06.420
This wheeled chair
will allow Mr. Newsome

20:06.482 --> 20:11.130
some natural movements,
such as waving his hands.

20:11.279 --> 20:14.070
I've opted for the royal wave.

20:14.248 --> 20:16.306
The person pushing
the wheelchair,

20:16.373 --> 20:19.380
controls the movements
very discreetly

20:19.521 --> 20:22.459
by adjusting these knobs.

20:24.060 --> 20:26.154
And he's fresh from the barber.

20:26.412 --> 20:28.818
Now that rigor has passed,

20:30.341 --> 20:32.279
he's ready for the town!

20:34.646 --> 20:38.396
Unfortunately, Mr. Newsome
lost the use of his legs

20:38.463 --> 20:40.830
after the shooting. We hope
it's only temporary.

20:40.866 --> 20:43.505
And in the meantime, detective
Murdoch has outfitted him

20:43.554 --> 20:46.488
with a special wheeled chair.

20:46.935 --> 20:49.380
And he's still willing
to testify against Mr. Grey?

20:49.513 --> 20:52.529
Yes. He's more determined
now than ever, Miss cherry.

20:52.755 --> 20:54.844
How can you be sure that
the man who shot Mr. Newsome.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.888
is in fact working for Mr. Grey?

20:56.982 --> 20:59.388
Well, we can't prove it yet,

20:59.599 --> 21:01.751
But the three witnesses set
to testify against him

21:01.787 --> 21:04.677
being shot just prior
to the trial...

21:05.056 --> 21:07.373
A difficult
coincidence to overlook.

21:07.576 --> 21:09.810
You mentioned that Mr. Newsome
had been placed in seclusion

21:09.888 --> 21:13.084
at the Windsor House Hotel,
under your supervision.

21:13.201 --> 21:15.865
How did he come to be
shot on the street?

21:15.958 --> 21:19.380
Yes, that. Well, he had some
important matters to see to,

21:19.482 --> 21:22.498
V-V-V-Vital to the preparation
of the trial.

21:22.574 --> 21:24.865
- It sadly couldn't be avoided.
- Forgive me for asking.

21:24.943 --> 21:27.255
But does Mr. Newsome fault
you or the constabulary

21:27.334 --> 21:30.748
for his current predicament?
He hasn't said so.

21:31.451 --> 21:33.529
Well, keep me abreast,
constable.

21:33.618 --> 21:35.685
Miss cherry. Will do.

21:44.263 --> 21:46.896
Well done, George. Heck of
a yarn you wove for her.

21:46.974 --> 21:48.927
Yes, I suppose so.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.068
What's the matter?

21:52.373 --> 21:54.204
It's all a big lie, isn't it?

21:54.263 --> 21:56.380
Yes, I know. It's great.

21:57.020 --> 21:58.966
Yes, but the truth
will come out eventually.

21:59.349 --> 22:01.325
What will she think of me then?

22:01.474 --> 22:03.599
What does she think of you now?

22:03.974 --> 22:05.536
I don't know.

22:05.708 --> 22:08.927
Well, if it helps us catch two
killers, is it not worth it?

22:09.403 --> 22:13.020
Gentleman, say hello
to Roger Newsome.

22:13.184 --> 22:14.770
Hello.

22:14.880 --> 22:16.958
Oh my goodness!

22:17.380 --> 22:19.796
You can't make him talk,
can you sir?

22:21.950 --> 22:24.267
Ha Ha,  No, Henry.

22:24.395 --> 22:26.880
As you can see,
I have customized

22:26.938 --> 22:29.472
This wheeled chair so that
its operator can manipulate

22:29.507 --> 22:31.485
- Mr. Newsome's movements.
- Sir, it's nothing short of

22:31.509 --> 22:33.911
remarkable. Very inventive.

22:34.192 --> 22:37.661
But how exactly are we going
to lure out Rex Grey's man?

22:37.731 --> 22:39.981
Actually, I have given
that considerable thought.

22:40.097 --> 22:42.798
<i>As a result of the newspaper
article, the gunman</i>

22:42.857 --> 22:45.942
<i>likely knows Mr. Newsome is
staying at the windsor house.</i>

22:46.130 --> 22:48.124
<i>And we know the gunman's
modus operandi</i>

22:48.159 --> 22:51.160
<i>is to shoot his targets
from a distance like a sniper.</i>

22:51.317 --> 22:53.450
<i>We can use that
to our advantage.</i>

22:53.606 --> 22:55.614
<i>We will roll Mr. Newsome
all the way</i>

22:55.676 --> 22:58.143
<i>to the windsor house, allowing
everyone a good look at him</i>

22:58.203 --> 23:01.224
<i>to see that he is indeed
alive. Once there,</i>

23:01.270 --> 23:04.349
<i>Dr. Ogden and I will set him up
for dinner in our suite,</i>

23:04.434 --> 23:07.294
<i>Conveniently seating him
in front of the window,</i>

23:07.403 --> 23:09.630
<i>Thus allowing the gunman
a clean shot</i>

23:09.669 --> 23:12.613
<i>from the building next door.</i>

23:12.751 --> 23:15.485
<i>Meanwhile, you two will
have discreetly secured</i>

23:15.520 --> 23:18.087
<i>the building next door.
When the gunman tries</i>

23:18.145 --> 23:21.083
<i>to make his escape, he should
run right into your arms.</i>

23:21.184 --> 23:22.599
<i>Now don't forget, he is armed,</i>

23:22.662 --> 23:25.450
<i>so you must make a stop
at the armory yourselves.</i>

23:27.419 --> 23:29.724
Well, let's hope it works.

23:29.791 --> 23:32.161
Oh, I'm quite confident it will.

23:33.809 --> 23:36.153
So you'll make a new plan.
You always do.

23:36.286 --> 23:38.833
But I liked this plan, Julia.

23:40.395 --> 23:42.622
Perhaps the shooter realized
that the building next door

23:42.647 --> 23:44.536
had been secured.

23:44.927 --> 23:48.622
Or he realized Mr. Newsome
was in fact already dead.

23:49.325 --> 23:50.794
A sobering thought.

23:51.106 --> 23:53.481
You barely touched your
roast chicken, Mr. Newsome.

23:53.560 --> 23:55.935
Was something the matter?
I suppose

23:55.985 --> 23:58.263
I lacked an appetite,
knowing I was

23:58.330 --> 24:00.755
going to be shot any moment.

24:01.567 --> 24:04.231
Or rather he mistakenly
thought you'd prepared it.

24:10.208 --> 24:11.997
Detective Murdoch.

24:12.489 --> 24:14.777
Yes, George, please come
and collect Mr. Newsome

24:14.849 --> 24:17.505
and bring him to the morgue's
cold storage for the night.

24:18.395 --> 24:21.184
Higgins... George, catch him!

24:21.380 --> 24:23.489
Oh Higgins, his hand
went in my mouth!

24:23.552 --> 24:27.372
- Come on, George.
- Ok. Here we go.

24:27.591 --> 24:31.677
Higgins, try to move his feet.

24:31.849 --> 24:34.934
His feet, like this.

24:34.997 --> 24:38.101
Mr. Newsome, I wager the
detective would make some

24:38.216 --> 24:40.825
interesting dinner conversation?

24:41.645 --> 24:42.989
I've never dined with him
myself, you see.

24:43.044 --> 24:44.724
Higgins, why are you
talking to him?

24:44.803 --> 24:47.622
George, we have to
pretend he's alive!

24:48.028 --> 24:50.646
I imagine the doctor would have
been in her evening wear?

24:50.682 --> 24:52.716
All right, Higgins,
that's enough. Let's just

24:52.741 --> 24:54.817
get him in the chair. Ok.

24:58.864 --> 25:00.890
Roger! Mr. Newsome, are you ok?!

25:00.925 --> 25:03.341
Higgins, go after the gunman!

25:23.239 --> 25:25.520
Another forty-five calibre,
detective,

25:25.692 --> 25:28.044
pierced his heart.
Surely would have been fatal,

25:28.083 --> 25:30.372
if he were not already
dead, of course.

25:30.564 --> 25:32.278
Thank you.

25:33.044 --> 25:35.958
Once again, this is all the
gunman's left behind for us.

25:36.122 --> 25:38.216
It would appear
the ruse is up, William.

25:38.309 --> 25:42.231
The gunman must be convinced of
Mr. Newsome's death by now.

25:44.239 --> 25:46.591
Not necessarily.

25:47.895 --> 25:51.184
My bullet resistant vest.

25:51.677 --> 25:53.575
Gun please.

25:54.855 --> 25:56.927
Ears.

26:06.333 --> 26:08.458
So if Mr. Newsome had've
been wearing this,

26:08.567 --> 26:10.841
last night's shooting
would not have been fatal.

26:10.938 --> 26:13.044
- Hypothetically. 
- Hypothetically.

26:13.239 --> 26:15.708
So, should Miss James
and I revive him once again?

26:15.911 --> 26:18.489
- If you would, please.
- How do we convince

26:18.546 --> 26:20.458
the killer that Newsome
was wearing this?

26:20.948 --> 26:23.786
Have your newspaper friend
write another article

26:23.856 --> 26:26.956
about how Mr. Newsome
survived yet again.

26:27.208 --> 26:30.242
Obviously the shooter took
notice of the first article.

26:31.450 --> 26:33.510
Right.

26:38.746 --> 26:41.380
And here it is.

26:41.573 --> 26:45.768
Goodness, the constabulary
surely thought of everything.

26:45.940 --> 26:48.659
It's an original invention of
detective Murdoch's, made out of

26:48.745 --> 26:50.518
metal and silk.

26:52.214 --> 26:54.401
And now it's saved
Mr. Newsome's life.

26:54.479 --> 26:55.542
That's right.

26:55.589 --> 26:57.594
And even after this latest
brush with death, you still

26:57.618 --> 27:00.760
- believe he'll testify?
- He insists.

27:01.122 --> 27:03.753
I would surely like
to interview him.

27:03.971 --> 27:05.846
A couple of quotes would
spruce up my story.

27:05.885 --> 27:09.728
That will not be possible. You see,

27:09.815 --> 27:14.049
Miss cherry, the vest... While
it did save the man's life,

27:14.101 --> 27:16.869
the- the -the  sheer impact of it,

27:16.979 --> 27:19.768
the bullet broke one of his ribs.

27:19.878 --> 27:22.573
And speaking is very painful.

27:22.676 --> 27:28.160
Even his breathing
is-is  not noticeable very well.

27:28.613 --> 27:30.516
Why are you bringing
these stories to me

27:30.551 --> 27:33.252
of all reporters?
You wouldn't be

27:33.287 --> 27:35.676
finding excuses to see more
often, would you, constable?

27:35.881 --> 27:38.355
No, that's not
the reason. I mean,

27:38.380 --> 27:39.603
I-I very much enjoy your company.

27:39.697 --> 27:42.559
But I'm under direct orders
from detective Murdoch.

27:42.691 --> 27:45.269
Well shoot, George,
if we had thought to put this

27:45.296 --> 27:46.941
on Roger Newsome, he might
still be alive!

27:46.992 --> 27:48.654
Oh, Henry!

27:49.954 --> 27:52.193
So he wasn't wearing
this last night?

27:52.333 --> 27:54.018
No.

27:54.076 --> 27:57.568
- Constable Crabtree?
- He was not.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.013
So he's dead...

28:01.326 --> 28:03.412
And has been this entire time.

28:03.747 --> 28:05.560
Uh oh. Yes,

28:05.677 --> 28:07.802
But... Wait, Miss cherry!

28:07.881 --> 28:10.552
Miss cherry, wait! Please, wait!

28:10.693 --> 28:12.587
I unwittingly lied to
my readers thanks to you.

28:12.636 --> 28:15.357
- I know. I'm sorry. I didn't want to do it.
- Perhaps I'll write a story of

28:15.387 --> 28:18.005
how the constabulary deceive the
public! How would you like that?

28:18.112 --> 28:20.913
I would not like that.
But I have a proposition.

28:21.076 --> 28:24.138
I-I-I-If you print the story of
Mr. Newsome surviving again,

28:24.232 --> 28:26.654
then when the trial is over,
I will give you and only you

28:26.732 --> 28:28.412
the whole true story.

28:28.436 --> 28:31.435
The-The-The story of how the
constabulary brought a corpse

28:31.490 --> 28:35.865
back to life to catch a killer
and bring Rex Grey to justice.

28:36.208 --> 28:37.616
I've covered Mr. Grey before,

28:37.651 --> 28:40.349
and I know full well
how evil he is.

28:40.841 --> 28:42.224
If this will help
send him to the gallows

28:42.249 --> 28:46.154
then... I suppose
I should do my part.

28:47.154 --> 28:48.427
But you do owe me,

28:48.462 --> 28:51.021
- Constable Crabtree.
-  Miss cherry.

28:58.005 --> 29:00.466
We need to get Mr. Newsome
out into the open,

29:00.638 --> 29:04.396
But in an enclosed space so
that we can catch the killer.

29:04.578 --> 29:08.232
I wonder if we can create some sort
of event for Mr. Newsome to attend.

29:08.349 --> 29:11.083
Sir, we may not
have to create one.

29:11.118 --> 29:13.518
Just prior to his death,
Mr. Newsome was determined

29:13.554 --> 29:16.321
to follow through with this
presentation he was to give

29:16.357 --> 29:19.586
tonight on the fancy bird
that he discovered.

29:19.927 --> 29:21.024
- Right.
- Why don't we let him?

29:21.078 --> 29:23.436
Is it too late to get a mention of it in
the latest newspaper article?

29:23.518 --> 29:26.586
I shouldn't think so,
sir. However...

29:27.547 --> 29:30.758
If the killer was too cautious
to take a shot at the hotel,

29:30.985 --> 29:33.446
why would he tonight
at the presentation?

29:33.707 --> 29:35.774
Just as it is may very well be

29:35.852 --> 29:37.987
our last chance
to trap the gunman.

29:38.081 --> 29:40.956
It's also the gunman's last
chance to kill Mr. Newsome.

29:41.081 --> 29:43.526
Right. And Grey must be
leaning on his man

29:43.584 --> 29:45.698
to finish the job with the trial
right around the corner.

29:45.909 --> 29:48.909
Now, but how is Mr. Newsome
going to present?

29:49.026 --> 29:51.690
He remains, after all, a corpse.

29:52.073 --> 29:53.855
Perhaps I'll present
for him, sir.

29:54.034 --> 29:56.628
I'll wheel the sitting duck
out there and then explain

29:56.692 --> 29:59.878
to the audience that Newsome
can't speak due to a broken rib.

29:59.972 --> 30:04.711
- I'll be his voice.
- Very good, George. Very good.

30:04.808 --> 30:07.980
I suppose you had better brush up
on your ornithology before then.

30:08.034 --> 30:10.342
Uh, I rather look forward to it.

30:12.259 --> 30:16.028
I do hope Mr. Newsome's hair is
satisfactory after my little trim.

30:16.503 --> 30:20.120
Yes, Julia, I've been meaning
to speak to you about something.

30:20.308 --> 30:22.050
What is it?

30:23.261 --> 30:25.691
If it means that much to you,
the next time I need

30:25.759 --> 30:27.441
a haircut...

30:29.245 --> 30:31.897
What about
Mrs. Kitchen's beef stew?

30:31.932 --> 30:34.833
Well...
I could request her recipe.

30:37.362 --> 30:39.003
We really should be off.

30:39.073 --> 30:40.862
On our date?

30:41.300 --> 30:43.809
We're there to catch a killer.
We must be mindful

30:43.844 --> 30:46.151
- of our surroundings.
- Well,

30:46.370 --> 30:49.181
We'll have to be love-birds
after work then.

30:58.136 --> 30:59.964
Henry,

31:00.151 --> 31:02.511
I need you, along with
the other constables

31:02.596 --> 31:05.564
to station yourselves out here,
ready to apprehend the gunman

31:05.599 --> 31:07.120
Should he escape. Yes, sir.

31:07.198 --> 31:09.701
Now, I have sealed off
the back so you need only be

31:09.737 --> 31:11.948
mindful of the front
and side entrances.

31:12.094 --> 31:14.878
- It's good thinking, sir.
- It's an interesting bird.

31:14.991 --> 31:17.745
This inca tern. If he shoots,

31:17.845 --> 31:19.870
You will be able
to hear it from outside.

31:19.980 --> 31:23.917
So ready yourself along with the other
constables to apprehend the gunman.

31:27.441 --> 31:28.698
George?

31:28.800 --> 31:30.856
Sir, I'm trying to perfect

31:30.891 --> 31:34.370
the inca tern's unusual
cat-like call.

31:34.628 --> 31:37.763
Alright, let's position
ourselves inside,

31:38.040 --> 31:41.975
and get ready. Henry,
don't let him escape.

31:43.864 --> 31:47.691
The air was still,
damp with mist.

31:48.301 --> 31:50.996
I'm sorry, the air
was still damp with mist.

31:51.191 --> 31:54.410
Mr. Newsome had been out
for more than an hour

31:54.473 --> 31:58.394
and seen nothing but
a crooked-beaked blue Jay.

31:59.152 --> 32:01.035
But something compelled him

32:01.144 --> 32:02.512
to push on,

32:02.669 --> 32:05.002
a calling if you will.

32:05.363 --> 32:08.199
Excuse me...

32:11.254 --> 32:15.105
Nay, not a calling.
Something more powerful.

32:15.242 --> 32:18.973
And so Mr. Newsome
bravely forged on.

32:19.144 --> 32:22.699
It was then he heard
a faint cat-like meow

32:22.793 --> 32:26.127
coming from a tree.

32:26.280 --> 32:29.448
He approached the tree quietly

32:29.483 --> 32:31.550
And he saw this!

32:31.585 --> 32:34.886
The inca tern!

32:34.922 --> 32:38.223
The first ever observed
in north America.

32:38.258 --> 32:41.159
A momentous ornithological
discovery,

32:41.195 --> 32:43.295
Calling into question
all we thought

32:43.330 --> 32:46.898
We knew about
migratory patterns!

32:46.934 --> 32:50.735
Nonsense! Nonsense!

32:50.771 --> 32:52.604
What you are claiming,
Mr. Newsome,

32:52.639 --> 32:55.574
Is a lie. It's impossible!

32:55.609 --> 32:58.577
Mr. Faber, how can you
argue against this

32:58.612 --> 33:02.414
Photograph? Clearly
taken in Toronto.

33:02.449 --> 33:04.916
I don't know,
but it can't be real!

33:04.952 --> 33:07.919
Well, I assure you, sir, it is.

33:07.955 --> 33:11.590
I want to hear it from Mr. Newsome
himself, not his mouthpiece!

33:11.625 --> 33:14.659
Stop!

33:21.535 --> 33:23.401
Sir! Sir! I got him!

33:23.437 --> 33:27.205
I stopped him,
just like you said.

33:27.241 --> 33:30.408
He's dead.

33:35.149 --> 33:38.216
We needed him alive, Henry!

33:41.054 --> 33:43.188
I'm sorry, sir.

33:55.168 --> 33:57.936
Same calibre as the bullets taken
from the other two witnesses.

33:57.971 --> 33:59.971
Leaving little doubt their
killer is the same man.

34:00.006 --> 34:02.774
And even less doubt that
he's working for Rex Grey.

34:02.809 --> 34:04.876
Yet we can't establish
a definitive link.

34:04.911 --> 34:07.111
Sir, without
witnesses to testify,

34:07.147 --> 34:09.112
Is he just going to walk free?

34:09.149 --> 34:11.683
Unfortunately, I see
no choice but to telephone

34:11.717 --> 34:14.518
Crown prosecutor Daniels and
tell him the charade is over.

34:14.554 --> 34:17.188
I solved the case!

34:17.224 --> 34:19.657
I solved the case!

34:19.693 --> 34:22.327
To which case are you
referring, Mr. Faber?

34:22.362 --> 34:25.964
This is Roger's grand discovery!

34:25.998 --> 34:28.632
A dead inca tern! I told you

34:28.668 --> 34:31.168
He was lying!
Well, how can you be sure

34:31.204 --> 34:33.204
This is the bird that
Mr. Newsome photographed?

34:33.239 --> 34:36.174
Because I got it from his house.
Ruth Newsome gave you this?

34:36.208 --> 34:39.744
No. You broke in then?

34:39.779 --> 34:42.880
No, I would never do such thing.

34:42.916 --> 34:45.216
I found an open window.

34:45.252 --> 34:47.719
So it's a stuffed bird.
Why are you so intent

34:47.754 --> 34:49.821
On ruining the reputation
of a dead man?

34:49.856 --> 34:52.891
Because I knew that the inca
tern couldn't possibly be

34:52.926 --> 34:55.893
In Toronto, yet everyone chose
to believe Roger instead.

34:55.929 --> 34:58.496
How can you be sure? Because,

34:58.531 --> 35:01.032
The inca tern is
native to south America

35:01.067 --> 35:03.334
And restricted by
the humboldt current.

35:03.370 --> 35:06.638
Making its way to Canada
would be an impossibility.

35:06.673 --> 35:09.274
The fool!

35:09.309 --> 35:12.477
If he knew anything about birds
he would have at least chosen

35:12.512 --> 35:15.446
One that could
conceivably make it here.

35:15.482 --> 35:17.815
So you believe Mr. Newsome
had the bird shipped

35:17.851 --> 35:21.352
From south America so he could
discover it in Canada.

35:21.388 --> 35:24.155
Yes! And it likely
died en route,

35:24.190 --> 35:27.258
Making him a bird killer, too.

35:27.294 --> 35:30.561
So he then stuffed the bird,
placed it up a tree

35:30.597 --> 35:33.865
And discovered it anyway.
Yes! Yes! Exactly!

35:33.900 --> 35:36.935
But for him to place
the bird in the tree,

35:36.970 --> 35:39.304
He would have to climb it.

35:39.339 --> 35:43.107
I had a bird's eye view.

35:43.143 --> 35:45.543
Bird's... Eye...

35:45.578 --> 35:48.179
View.

35:48.214 --> 35:51.382
"Bird's eye view." sir?

35:51.418 --> 35:53.785
Mr. Newsome's dying words.
At first,

35:53.820 --> 35:56.220
I wasn't sure what he meant,
but he may have been

35:56.256 --> 35:58.623
Trying to tell us that
he saw something more

35:58.658 --> 36:01.726
From atop the tree
where he placed this bird.

36:01.761 --> 36:05.997
Sir, he did at one point hint to me that he
knew something more about the case. I thought

36:06.032 --> 36:08.166
He was trying to weasel
his way out of testifying.

36:08.201 --> 36:10.435
We have to find that tree.
How will we do that?

36:10.470 --> 36:12.370
Bring along Mr. Newsome's
photographs.

36:12.405 --> 36:15.006
Yes, yes, let's do that.
And you, Mr. Faber,

36:15.041 --> 36:17.742
Will be staying here, being
booked for breaking in

36:17.777 --> 36:19.744
And stealing Mr. Newsome's bird.

36:19.779 --> 36:22.947
But... But I solved the case.

36:22.983 --> 36:24.949
Gimme that bird.

36:24.985 --> 36:26.985
So,

36:27.020 --> 36:28.987
Mr. Newsome saw the bird

36:29.022 --> 36:31.389
And photographed it
early in the morning?

36:31.424 --> 36:35.526
That's right, sir, the air
was still damp with mist.

36:37.998 --> 36:40.698
So... The sun would have been

36:40.734 --> 36:43.134
Coming from that direction,

36:43.169 --> 36:46.170
Which means that
could be our tree.

36:46.206 --> 36:48.806
Sir,

36:48.842 --> 36:52.176
I'm surprise Newsome would climb
a tree in the first place.

36:52.212 --> 36:56.347
He seemed so particular
about his trousers.

36:56.383 --> 36:59.817
What I don't understand is if
Mr. Newsome did see something,

36:59.853 --> 37:01.919
Why not simply tell us

37:01.955 --> 37:04.222
Instead of risking
his life to testify?

37:04.257 --> 37:07.759
Yes, but sir, this is a man
who at the puzzle club

37:07.794 --> 37:10.628
Had us all believing that he was
a killer just so we would

37:10.663 --> 37:12.864
Also think he was the first one
to solve the puzzle.

37:12.899 --> 37:15.867
Prideful man, I suppose.

37:15.902 --> 37:17.902
Hmm.

37:23.476 --> 37:25.743
Could this feather
be from our bird?

37:25.779 --> 37:29.013
Sir, that white tip?

37:29.049 --> 37:31.416
That's as unmistakable
as the inca tern's

37:31.451 --> 37:35.086
Red beak and white moustache.

37:39.592 --> 37:41.592
Ah, yes.

37:44.230 --> 37:46.664
Yes, this is it, George.

37:46.699 --> 37:49.200
This is where Mr. Newsome

37:49.235 --> 37:52.503
Planted his bird

37:52.539 --> 37:54.872
In the tree

37:54.908 --> 37:58.810
Before leading his fellow bird
watchers back here to witness

37:58.845 --> 38:01.879
Him making his false discovery.
Having no idea

38:01.915 --> 38:03.881
They would be about
to see Rex Grey murder

38:03.917 --> 38:05.883
His business partner
in the distance.

38:05.919 --> 38:08.019
At which time they
immediately fled, leaving

38:08.054 --> 38:10.488
His precious bird behind.

38:10.523 --> 38:14.058
Newsome perhaps retrieved it later that
day, sir. When the police were gone.

38:14.094 --> 38:16.794
And when he did, he would have
had the same vantage point

38:16.830 --> 38:20.064
Of the murder scene
that I do now.

38:20.100 --> 38:23.267
It would have been roughly
the same time of day...

38:39.119 --> 38:41.886
George,

38:41.921 --> 38:44.889
I believe we may
have what we need

38:44.924 --> 38:46.924
To convict Mr. Grey.

38:46.960 --> 38:50.628
Without any witness testimony
or evidence to speak of,

38:50.663 --> 38:54.065
I see no choice
but to release Mr. Grey.

38:54.100 --> 38:56.834
Thank you, your honour.

38:56.870 --> 38:59.103
I told you.

38:59.139 --> 39:01.939
I am not happy about this.

39:08.047 --> 39:11.149
Mr. Daniels, your office
said we might find you here.

39:11.184 --> 39:14.452
Detective Murdoch. Did you
come to see off Mr. Grey

39:14.487 --> 39:17.121
Now that he's
about to be released?

39:17.157 --> 39:19.891
Quite the opposite, actually.

39:19.926 --> 39:22.426
The murder weapon.

39:22.462 --> 39:24.428
Found near the scene of
the crime, complete with

39:24.464 --> 39:26.898
Mr. Grey's fingermarks on it.
And the bullets

39:26.933 --> 39:29.000
Match the one found
in his partner.

39:29.035 --> 39:32.470
Your honour, I do believe we
should proceed with the trial.

39:32.505 --> 39:36.941
See you bright
and early, Mr. Grey.

39:43.883 --> 39:47.451
Why the bird?

39:47.487 --> 39:49.987
I was going to try to explain
how we came to find the gun.

39:50.023 --> 39:51.956
This bird had a hand in it,

39:51.991 --> 39:53.925
But it's perhaps
too long a story now.

39:53.960 --> 39:56.694
Then save it for the stand,
constable.

39:56.729 --> 40:00.698
- You want me to testify?
- Why yes. And bring your bird.

40:04.837 --> 40:07.338
You can thank Mr. Newsome
for this, Mr. Grey.

40:07.373 --> 40:11.041
That's Roger Newsome,
of the Mimico Newsomes.

40:17.279 --> 40:19.979
I had my share of moments
with Mr.Newsome,

40:19.994 --> 40:23.503
over the recent years,
I have to say,

40:23.539 --> 40:27.941
only now, in death,
have I grown to admire the man.

40:27.977 --> 40:30.410
For with his dying words,

40:30.446 --> 40:33.447
he helped the constabulary
catch a killer.

40:33.482 --> 40:35.983
And so, now,

40:36.018 --> 40:39.586
I hope that Mr. Newsome is
looking down on us with pride

40:39.622 --> 40:43.590
From his newly-found
"bird's eye view".

40:43.626 --> 40:47.027
And now, for some
closing remarks,

40:47.062 --> 40:50.897
I would like to call on
detective William Murdoch.

40:55.504 --> 40:58.772
Go ahead, William.
I hardly knew the man.

40:58.807 --> 41:02.416
You spent the whole
weekend with him!

41:09.652 --> 41:12.152
I recently had occasion

41:12.187 --> 41:16.723
to dine with Mr. Newsome,

41:16.759 --> 41:19.426
and I can say

41:19.461 --> 41:23.530
that his table manners
were exemplary.

41:23.565 --> 41:26.867
Bravo! Yes. Bravo!

41:30.105 --> 41:32.573
I truly am sorry
we weren't able to

41:32.640 --> 41:35.042
bring Roger back
for you, Miss Newsome.

41:35.077 --> 41:37.477
Oh?

41:37.513 --> 41:39.946
Just how sorry are you, Henry?

41:41.950 --> 41:44.885
Miss cherry, I didn't
even see you back here.

41:44.920 --> 41:47.087
A good reporter knows
how to go unnoticed.

41:47.122 --> 41:49.022
I suppose I owe you a story.

41:49.058 --> 41:51.625
I have the time
if you have the inclination.

41:53.529 --> 41:56.530
Alright then.

41:58.534 --> 42:01.282
I told you this would be fun.

42:02.090 --> 42:05.186
This is a hobby for people
with entirely too much time

42:05.237 --> 42:09.376
on their hands. Not a city
coroner or a police detective.

42:09.442 --> 42:11.578
One must strike
a balance between

42:11.613 --> 42:13.580
work and leisure, William.

42:13.615 --> 42:16.183
It's a bit <i> too</i> leisurely.

42:16.218 --> 42:19.019
Now if only we could
find a bird to watch.

42:19.054 --> 42:20.988
Birds are everywhere.

42:21.019 --> 42:23.724
You see them
walking to your grocer.

42:23.759 --> 42:25.726
I don't understand
travelling all this way

42:25.761 --> 42:27.728
to see something
that's all around?

42:27.763 --> 42:31.264
Yes but here we can observe
them in their natural habitat.

42:31.300 --> 42:33.266
But why?

42:33.302 --> 42:35.769
Birds behave the same here
as they do in the city.

42:35.804 --> 42:40.040
They will fly, they'll perch,
they'll sing.

42:40.075 --> 42:42.109
Surely you can appreciate
the tranquility

42:42.144 --> 42:44.377
Of the setting, at least!

42:44.413 --> 42:46.713
Yes, well, it is quiet...

42:46.749 --> 42:50.417
And secluded.

42:50.452 --> 42:52.686
William!

42:55.257 --> 42:58.892
Someone might see us!

42:58.927 --> 43:01.995
Look, William!

43:02.030 --> 43:04.131
It's a north American goldfinch!

43:04.166 --> 43:07.200
Or is it merely
a yellow warbler?

43:07.236 --> 43:10.370
Regardless, it's magnificent.

43:10.405 --> 43:13.507
Aah! Oh! What a thrill!

43:13.522 --> 43:16.443
Precisely Synchronized by <font color=#00FF00>srjanapala</font>

43:16.776 --> 43:18.058
William!
