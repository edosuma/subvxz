00:01.522 --> 00:02.262
Previously
onBuffy the Vampire Slayer...

00:02.306 --> 00:04.264
I'm Faith.

00:04.307 --> 00:05.266
I'm gonna go out
on a limb and say

00:05.309 --> 00:07.397
there's a new slayer in town.

00:07.442 --> 00:09.138
Gee, if doing violence
to vampires upsets you,

00:09.182 --> 00:10.618
I think you're
in the wrong line of work.

00:10.662 --> 00:12.837
Yeah, or maybe you like it
a little too much.

00:12.881 --> 00:14.188
Faith, no!

00:14.230 --> 00:15.884
You killed a man.I don't care.

00:15.928 --> 00:17.277
She's unstable, Buffy.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.018
Guess that means
you have a job opening.

00:20.149 --> 00:22.673
[indistinct chatter]

00:40.256 --> 00:42.259
Well.

00:44.392 --> 00:45.957
Well.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.526
That was very...

00:48.570 --> 00:50.049
artistic.

00:52.008 --> 00:53.140
Yeah.

00:53.182 --> 00:55.707
It wasn't
what I expected.

00:55.750 --> 00:59.101
I've never
actually seen...

00:59.146 --> 01:01.103
Well, from the title,

01:01.148 --> 01:03.323
I thought it
was about food.

01:03.366 --> 01:05.063
Well, there was food.

01:06.762 --> 01:10.635
Right. The-the-the scene
with the... food.

01:12.376 --> 01:15.900
So, feel like getting
some hot chocolate

01:15.944 --> 01:18.513
or some cold shower?

01:18.555 --> 01:20.254
I'm sorry.

01:20.296 --> 01:23.299
I wanted to take you out
somewhere fun.

01:23.343 --> 01:27.216
It's been a long time
since I've been to the movies.

01:27.260 --> 01:28.783
They've changed.

01:28.826 --> 01:30.960
A little scary.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.135
And a little not,

01:33.180 --> 01:35.965
which is also scary.

01:36.008 --> 01:37.618
I'm sorry.

01:37.662 --> 01:41.230
I-I just don't like getting
you worked up like that.

01:41.275 --> 01:44.320
We can't actually do
any of those things.

01:44.365 --> 01:46.192
You'd lose your soul,
and besides,

01:46.235 --> 01:48.368
I don't even own a kimono.

01:48.412 --> 01:51.022
Buffy, you don't have
to worry about me.

01:51.067 --> 01:54.200
I just don't like
to rub your nose in it.

01:54.243 --> 01:57.508
Suddenly wondering where
that expression comes from.

01:57.551 --> 01:59.989
Look, I-I don't need to see
movies to get worked up.

02:00.031 --> 02:02.513
Just being around you
does that just fine.

02:02.557 --> 02:04.602
It doesn't mean that
I'm gonna lose control,

02:04.646 --> 02:07.257
or that I'm gonna be
frustrated around you.

02:07.301 --> 02:10.217
It feels nice just to feel.

02:10.258 --> 02:14.002
It doesn't drive you crazy
when we're close?

02:14.045 --> 02:16.353
Watch this.

02:26.362 --> 02:28.191
See?

02:28.235 --> 02:31.367
Safe as houses.

02:39.462 --> 02:42.248
Check out the lust bunnies.

02:47.122 --> 02:49.299
Patrol?

02:50.647 --> 02:52.911
Council has you back
on active duty?

02:52.954 --> 02:54.435
Finally.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.828
They want us
down by Mercer.

02:56.872 --> 02:58.481
Okay.

03:00.396 --> 03:01.919
Good night.

03:04.270 --> 03:06.447
I'll see you soon.

03:06.490 --> 03:07.448
Don't worry, big guy.

03:07.490 --> 03:09.753
Just keeping her
warm for you.

03:19.286 --> 03:21.243
I got to tell you, B.

03:21.288 --> 03:23.942
The willpower thing?
Nice job.

03:23.985 --> 03:25.727
Thanks.
What?

03:25.770 --> 03:29.078
The "close but no cigar"
deal with Angel.

03:29.121 --> 03:31.253
I don't know if I could
handle, you know,

03:31.298 --> 03:33.603
the way you're
not handling it.

03:33.647 --> 03:35.258
Faith, when it comes to Angel,
do me a favor.

03:35.301 --> 03:37.086
Duck!

03:37.128 --> 03:38.478
[growls]

03:38.521 --> 03:39.522
Ow! Ooh, what are you-- nuts,

03:39.567 --> 03:42.264
going around punching people?

03:42.308 --> 03:44.135
People?

03:44.180 --> 03:46.312
So what, I'm a demon.
That makes it okay?

03:46.355 --> 03:48.618
Hold it!
Whoa! Stake me now,

03:48.663 --> 03:50.533
and you'll never find out
what I got for you, huh?

03:50.578 --> 03:52.622
Think about it--
demon seeks slayers.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.364
Highly unusual.

03:56.323 --> 03:57.627
Talk fast.

03:57.671 --> 03:58.889
How'd you like to get your hands

03:58.933 --> 04:01.457
on the Books of Ascension,huh?

04:01.502 --> 04:03.677
Never heard of them.

04:03.721 --> 04:05.680
Books of Ascension--
very powerful works,

04:05.723 --> 04:07.681
and I'm not talking
about the prose.

04:07.724 --> 04:09.509
They deal with some,
uh, dark stuff,

04:09.552 --> 04:11.860
and the mayor, he would hate it

04:11.902 --> 04:14.079
if somebody got ahold
of them before he, uh,

04:14.122 --> 04:15.342
well, you know.

04:15.384 --> 04:17.517
Don't know.
Before he what?

04:17.560 --> 04:20.172
Hey, hey, read 'em and weep.
That's all I got to say.

04:20.216 --> 04:21.651
Tomorrow I get the books.

04:21.696 --> 04:23.437
Meet me here,
and if the price is right,

04:23.480 --> 04:25.481
well, I give the books to you.

04:25.526 --> 04:27.571
Not really looking
to trade with a demon.

04:27.615 --> 04:29.572
And if this were still
a barter economy,

04:29.617 --> 04:32.446
that would be a problem.
I want cash, princess.

04:32.488 --> 04:34.447
Five large for the whole set.

04:34.490 --> 04:36.100
So you can buy--
I'm guessing here--

04:36.144 --> 04:37.668
some skin care products?

04:37.711 --> 04:40.454
Mm-mm, plane ticket
out of the Hellmouth

04:40.497 --> 04:42.803
before it's adios,
slayer loco.

04:42.846 --> 04:46.154
So... five G's?
What do you say?

04:46.197 --> 04:48.418
I think "die, fiend,"
sums it up,

04:48.461 --> 04:49.550
wouldn't you say?

04:49.593 --> 04:50.725
Oh, let him go.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.161
I don't think
he falls into

04:52.204 --> 04:53.944
"the deadly threat
to humanity" category.

04:53.988 --> 04:56.425
A demon's a demon.

04:56.470 --> 04:59.341
I'd like to know more about
these Books of Ascension.

04:59.386 --> 05:02.997
Anything that would pin
the mayor down would be great.

05:03.040 --> 05:04.434
Yeah.

05:05.216 --> 05:07.872
It be great.

05:09.961 --> 05:13.617
[wolf howling]

05:13.661 --> 05:17.490
â™ª

06:03.579 --> 06:06.670
And what exactly did
this demon look like?

06:06.713 --> 06:08.629
Demonic.

06:08.672 --> 06:11.632
Ah.
And you say he has

06:11.675 --> 06:14.069
the Books of Ascension,
or will soon,

06:14.112 --> 06:18.334
and he was, what--
willing to sell them?

06:18.377 --> 06:19.596
That's what I said.

06:19.639 --> 06:21.206
Hmm.

06:21.250 --> 06:22.773
You know what I wish?

06:22.817 --> 06:25.776
I wish you'd pull
your hair back.

06:25.819 --> 06:28.038
I know, I know, fashion
isn't exactly my thing,

06:28.082 --> 06:31.564
but gosh darn it, you know,
you've got such a nice face.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.435
I can't understand
why you hide it.

06:33.480 --> 06:36.264
Yeah, sure.

06:36.307 --> 06:38.266
Whatever.

06:38.310 --> 06:40.355
It's just a
matter of time

06:40.399 --> 06:42.358
before this demon guy's
gonna spill.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.533
Then Buffy and the Super Friends
are gonna--

06:44.577 --> 06:45.795
You worry too much
for a girl your age.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.494
That's unnecessary stress.

06:47.536 --> 06:50.148
Luckily,
I've got just the thing.

06:58.374 --> 06:59.810
There you go.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.552
Now, first you load up
on calcium,

07:02.596 --> 07:05.468
then find this demon,
kill the heck out of him,

07:05.512 --> 07:06.990
and bring the books to me.

07:09.298 --> 07:11.560
And if Buffy gets
to him first?

07:11.605 --> 07:14.911
Oh, well, frankly, I don't like
to think about that.

07:14.956 --> 07:17.697
I like good, positive,
upthoughts.

07:17.740 --> 07:20.396
If you fail me in that way,

07:20.439 --> 07:23.617
well, you know, replacing
Mr. Trick was chore enough.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.401
Oh, come on, don't worry.

07:25.444 --> 07:27.315
Drink up.

07:27.358 --> 07:29.317
There's nothing uncool
about healthy teeth and bones.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.494
WESLEY:
And you say

07:31.538 --> 07:33.843
this demon wanted cash?

07:33.887 --> 07:36.106
That's very unusual.

07:36.151 --> 07:37.543
Demons after money.

07:37.586 --> 07:39.545
Whatever happened to the
still-beating heart of a virgin?

07:39.588 --> 07:42.112
No one has
any standards anymore.

07:42.156 --> 07:44.593
Well, he said the books
were worth the price.

07:44.637 --> 07:46.466
What's this
ascension mean?

07:48.250 --> 07:49.643
I'm not sure.

07:49.685 --> 07:52.862
No, not, uh, not really
a common term in demonology.

07:52.906 --> 07:55.518
Ooh, ooh!
The-the Merenshtadt Text!

07:55.562 --> 07:58.389
Uh, I think in the section
on genocide,

07:58.433 --> 08:00.567
they mention ascension.

08:00.610 --> 08:01.742
Well, we have a winner.

08:01.785 --> 08:04.526
And more importantly,
two losers.

08:04.571 --> 08:06.702
Where did you find
that volume?

08:06.747 --> 08:08.749
In the top of your book cabinet

08:08.791 --> 08:10.141
with the stuff
you try to keep hidden.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.968
XANDER:
"Hidden"?

08:12.012 --> 08:14.754
Are there any engravings
I should know about?

08:14.798 --> 08:17.584
Uh, frolicking nymphs
of some kind?

08:17.627 --> 08:21.543
No, just magic secrets Giles
doesn't think I'm ready for.

08:21.588 --> 08:24.677
GILES: Um... ah, yes.
Yes, here we are.

08:24.721 --> 08:26.548
Yes, there's a reference here
to the journal

08:26.593 --> 08:31.206
of Desmond Kane, pastor
of a town called Sharpsville.

08:31.249 --> 08:33.120
"May 26, 1723.

08:33.163 --> 08:34.557
"Tomorrow is the ascension.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.732
God help us all."

08:37.734 --> 08:39.779
It was the last
anyone heard.

08:39.822 --> 08:41.695
Of Kane?

08:41.738 --> 08:43.130
Of Sharpsville.

08:43.173 --> 08:45.960
The town more or
less disappeared.

08:46.003 --> 08:48.397
So, ascension possibly
not a love-in.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.790
I think you should meet
with this demon, Buffy.

08:50.834 --> 08:51.966
Yeah?[door opens]

08:52.009 --> 08:53.402
Anybody got $5,000?

08:55.621 --> 08:57.798
I have something
important to ask you.

08:57.841 --> 08:59.451
XANDER:
Important?

08:59.495 --> 09:01.628
Let's start calculating
those odds, people.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.455
What are you doing Friday night?

09:03.499 --> 09:04.934
[stammers]

09:04.979 --> 09:07.721
As always, my sacred duty

09:07.764 --> 09:09.722
as a watcher

09:09.765 --> 09:12.202
prevents me from... why?

09:12.246 --> 09:14.727
I have a paper
to write for English,

09:14.770 --> 09:17.600
and you're English,
so I thought...

09:17.644 --> 09:18.948
[chuckles]

09:18.993 --> 09:20.254
What?!

09:20.298 --> 09:22.256
Is it so wrong
to be getting

09:22.299 --> 09:25.695
an insider's perspective?

09:25.739 --> 09:28.001
I study best in
a good restaurant.

09:28.044 --> 09:30.394
Around 8:00-ish?

09:30.438 --> 09:32.005
Think it over?

09:37.924 --> 09:39.447
XANDER:
And on the day the words

09:39.490 --> 09:42.058
"flimsy excuse" were redefined,
we stood in awe and watched.

09:42.102 --> 09:43.451
WESLEY:
Right.

09:43.495 --> 09:44.713
Books of Ascension,

09:44.758 --> 09:47.803
mayor, slaughter...

09:47.847 --> 09:49.500
Tell you what.

09:49.544 --> 09:51.241
Why don't we try
to find this demon

09:51.286 --> 09:54.288
sooner rather than later,
perhaps persuade him

09:54.331 --> 09:56.899
to lend us the books
free of charge?

09:56.943 --> 09:59.903
I think Faith might be useful
in that persuasion part.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.426
Hmm, I imagine so.

10:01.470 --> 10:03.341
Where is Faith, anyway?

10:12.307 --> 10:14.875
Hey, slayer.

10:14.918 --> 10:17.442
Uh, you know,
I wasn't expecting company.

10:17.485 --> 10:20.706
Give me a minute, and I'll have
the place tidied up for you.

10:20.750 --> 10:21.663
You got the books?

10:21.707 --> 10:23.884
Well, that depends.

10:23.927 --> 10:24.841
You got my money?

10:29.976 --> 10:33.414
Y-You're tough in negotiations,
and I respect that.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.506
Check 'em out.
Now, uh,

10:38.549 --> 10:40.029
that is quality
merchandise.

10:40.073 --> 10:41.815
That's worth
five grand, easy.

10:41.857 --> 10:43.380
Books of Ascension.

10:43.424 --> 10:44.817
Mm-hmm, original editions
and everything.

10:44.860 --> 10:47.254
Um, great condition.

10:47.298 --> 10:49.082
Okay, it's a, it's a
little worn on one spine,

10:49.125 --> 10:51.302
some slight foxing,
but otherwise

10:51.346 --> 10:52.869
perfect.

10:52.913 --> 10:54.783
Now, the five grand,

10:54.827 --> 10:55.959
it's, you know,

10:56.003 --> 10:57.525
negotiable.

10:57.568 --> 10:59.788
I don't like to haggle.

11:05.620 --> 11:07.144
[growling]

11:39.350 --> 11:40.961
Faith.

11:42.484 --> 11:43.832
Angel.

11:45.399 --> 11:46.966
I got nowhere else to go.

11:47.009 --> 11:49.533
Look.

11:49.577 --> 11:51.798
I hate asking for help,
but I'm asking,

11:51.841 --> 11:54.756
'cause I'm in trouble,

11:54.801 --> 11:56.889
like the real bad kind.

11:56.932 --> 12:00.023
It's okay.

12:00.067 --> 12:03.200
No, it's a couple county lines
over from okay, believe me.

12:03.244 --> 12:04.375
I believe you.

12:04.418 --> 12:07.029
Look, just talk.

12:07.073 --> 12:10.380
Come on, start
from the beginning.

12:10.424 --> 12:13.341
Mind if I skip past the
"mom never loved me" part

12:13.384 --> 12:15.385
and get right to it?

12:16.865 --> 12:19.173
I'm scaring myself.

12:19.216 --> 12:21.000
I know the feeling.

12:21.043 --> 12:22.176
That's why I came to you.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.917
I don't want to get
all 12-steppy,

12:23.960 --> 12:25.918
but remember when you told me

12:25.961 --> 12:27.658
that killing people'd
make me feel like

12:27.702 --> 12:28.748
some kind of god?

12:30.706 --> 12:32.926
I think I just
came down to earth.

12:32.969 --> 12:35.188
It's not human,

12:35.231 --> 12:36.581
if that's what you're thinking,

12:36.625 --> 12:38.018
not that that makes me
feel any better

12:38.061 --> 12:40.802
or this guy any less dead.

12:40.846 --> 12:42.936
Faith, you need help.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.894
You can't do this alone.

12:45.851 --> 12:46.852
I know.

12:46.895 --> 12:49.202
For real now, I'm scared.

12:49.245 --> 12:51.030
Scared of what I am,
what I'm turning into--

12:51.073 --> 12:53.684
cold-blooded,
straight-up killer.

12:53.729 --> 12:55.426
Like you.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.732
Not like me.
I didn't have a choice.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.255
But you do.

12:59.299 --> 13:00.822
Look, you can stop this.

13:00.866 --> 13:02.085
Believe me,
I don't want to end up

13:02.129 --> 13:04.000
the way everybody said I would.

13:04.043 --> 13:06.046
Dead or alone or a loser.

13:06.089 --> 13:07.611
You don't have to.

13:07.655 --> 13:08.875
I don't know.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.528
Maybe it's too late for me.

13:10.572 --> 13:12.703
It's not.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.096
Angel, I'm so scared.

13:14.140 --> 13:16.056
Hey...

13:16.099 --> 13:18.710
It's all right. Shh.
It's okay.

13:30.287 --> 13:32.115
Whoa.

13:32.158 --> 13:35.075
Whoa, Faith. I...

13:35.118 --> 13:36.990
Look, I can be here for you,

13:37.033 --> 13:39.774
but not like that, all right?

13:39.818 --> 13:41.690
I'm with Buffy.

13:41.732 --> 13:43.778
Buffy, yeah.

13:45.128 --> 13:46.782
I didn't mean it like that.

13:49.480 --> 13:53.267
Maybe I did,
but I wouldn't press it.

13:56.573 --> 13:58.880
You love her, don't you?

13:58.924 --> 14:00.883
I love her.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.144
Good for you.

14:02.188 --> 14:05.061
The two of you,
you're lucky.

14:06.932 --> 14:08.934
We friends?

14:08.977 --> 14:11.153
We're friends.

14:11.197 --> 14:12.721
Then I'm lucky, too.

14:15.505 --> 14:16.899
I better go.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.946
Where?

14:19.989 --> 14:22.164
I need to cool down.

14:22.208 --> 14:24.514
Spend some time alone.

14:24.558 --> 14:26.125
Don't worry about me.

14:26.168 --> 14:27.909
You've been a big help.

14:27.953 --> 14:29.869
Just knowing somebody cares.

14:32.653 --> 14:34.568
Hey,

14:34.611 --> 14:37.136
I know I shouldn't
be asking this, but...

14:37.179 --> 14:39.052
do you think if things
were different,

14:39.095 --> 14:42.316
that things between you and me
would be different, too?

14:42.359 --> 14:44.360
We'll never know.

14:44.404 --> 14:46.014
Right.

14:46.058 --> 14:48.148
How could we?

14:48.191 --> 14:49.626
Take care of yourself.

14:52.543 --> 14:54.980
FAITH:
Lifetime of practice.

15:02.162 --> 15:04.947
FAITH:
It's not like I wasn't trying.

15:04.990 --> 15:07.167
Okay?Hey, there's no need
to convince me.

15:07.210 --> 15:09.038
I'm sure you gave it
your level best.

15:09.081 --> 15:11.083
I just don't understand what
that boy could be thinking.

15:11.126 --> 15:12.519
Try Buffy Summers,

15:12.562 --> 15:15.087
like in a big, fat,
one-track way.

15:15.130 --> 15:17.307
Hey, come on,
don't be discouraged.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.048
You're a bright,
young, energetic girl

15:20.092 --> 15:22.399
with a whole life ahead of her,
and I won't tolerate brooding.

15:22.442 --> 15:24.532
So you couldn't give him that
one moment of true happiness.

15:24.575 --> 15:26.054
I was thinking more

15:26.099 --> 15:28.230
along the lines
of a long weekend, but okay.

15:28.274 --> 15:30.190
And he spurned your advances,
so be it.

15:30.232 --> 15:32.192
There's more than
one way to skin a cat,

15:32.235 --> 15:34.062
and I happen to know
that's factually true.

15:35.150 --> 15:38.240
We want to take
Angel's soul away.

15:38.284 --> 15:40.200
If we can't do it
by giving him happiness,

15:40.243 --> 15:42.592
well, by golly,
we'll just have to do it

15:42.636 --> 15:46.075
in the most painful way
imaginable.

15:57.477 --> 15:59.131
Find anything?

15:59.174 --> 16:01.090
A six-course banquet
of nothing

16:01.134 --> 16:03.571
with a scoop of sod all
as a palette cleanser.

16:03.614 --> 16:05.485
I've had no better luck.

16:09.142 --> 16:12.274
There must be something about
this ascension somewhere.

16:12.318 --> 16:14.668
Perhaps I should
contact the Council,

16:14.711 --> 16:16.278
maybe run a search through--

16:16.322 --> 16:18.106
No, I don't, uh...

16:18.150 --> 16:21.067
It should be I that--

16:21.110 --> 16:23.198
The Council
isn't entirely aware

16:23.243 --> 16:25.114
that I'm letting you
work for me.

16:27.115 --> 16:29.509
Um, withme.

16:29.552 --> 16:31.380
I don't think
they'd be very happy

16:31.424 --> 16:33.078
at the idea of the two of us
collaborating.

16:33.121 --> 16:34.297
Well, I wasn't about to burst

16:34.341 --> 16:36.865
into glorious
song about it myself.

16:36.908 --> 16:38.649
Why don't you
call them?

16:38.692 --> 16:40.869
I think the most
expedient plan would be

16:40.912 --> 16:43.480
to find these Books of
Ascensionthemselves.

16:43.524 --> 16:46.657
Buffy, you and Faith
must find this demon.

16:46.701 --> 16:49.269
And soon.

16:49.312 --> 16:50.922
I'll go back to the scene.

16:50.966 --> 16:53.142
See if I can track him.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.274
Wait for Faith.

16:54.317 --> 16:56.667
That could be hours.

16:56.711 --> 16:59.018
The girl makes Godot
look punctual.

17:00.105 --> 17:01.236
I'll just go myself.

17:01.280 --> 17:03.326
Buffy,

17:03.370 --> 17:05.762
this is a job
for the both of you.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.548
This demon could be anywhere.

17:07.589 --> 17:09.243
If these books are
as important as he says,

17:09.288 --> 17:11.942
he has good reason to hide.

17:11.987 --> 17:15.337
Finding him's going
to be extremely difficult.

17:15.382 --> 17:16.557
Found your demon.

17:16.598 --> 17:18.165
Fashion tip, Wes.

17:18.211 --> 17:19.690
Mouth looks
better closed.

17:19.733 --> 17:22.171
Got the address.

17:22.214 --> 17:23.303
I beat it out

17:23.346 --> 17:25.131
of Willie the Snitch
personally.

17:25.173 --> 17:28.307
You beat up Willie?Sure.

17:28.351 --> 17:31.223
Well, actually let's just say
I applied some pressure,

17:31.267 --> 17:33.313
or more accurately, that I,

17:33.355 --> 17:36.010
uh, asked politely, and then--

17:36.055 --> 17:38.361
Okay, I bribed him.

17:38.404 --> 17:39.666
How much?

17:39.710 --> 17:41.103
28 bucks.
Does the Council

17:41.146 --> 17:42.278
reimburse
for that kind of stuff?

17:42.322 --> 17:43.932
Did you get a receipt?

17:43.974 --> 17:45.325
Damn!

17:45.367 --> 17:46.760
I know this.

17:46.804 --> 17:48.458
It's down by the bus station.

17:48.501 --> 17:50.503
Not the nicest part of town.

17:50.547 --> 17:52.332
Again, see?
No standards.

17:52.375 --> 17:53.984
I mean,
any self-respecting demon

17:54.028 --> 17:56.727
should be living in a pit
of filth or a nice crypt.

17:56.770 --> 17:59.599
I'll remember
to mention that.

17:59.643 --> 18:01.992
Mention what?
Where we going, girlfriend?

18:02.037 --> 18:05.519
Uh, actually,
I can handle this one solo.

18:05.561 --> 18:07.564
Why should you get
to have all the fun?

18:07.607 --> 18:09.871
Share, share--
that's fair, right?

18:11.828 --> 18:14.180
Right.

18:14.222 --> 18:15.223
Found our demon.

18:16.573 --> 18:17.835
Oh.

18:17.878 --> 18:20.534
Well, let's go look him up.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.411
Is it me, or did it just
get really cold in here?

18:28.454 --> 18:29.455
[door opens]

18:34.982 --> 18:36.157
Faith, careful.

18:36.201 --> 18:38.464
Right.

18:42.990 --> 18:44.949
Missed you last night.

18:44.992 --> 18:47.343
Yeah, I was patrolling.

18:47.386 --> 18:50.172
No shortage of scum you got
to watch in Sunnydale, right?

18:50.215 --> 18:52.218
So I've heard.

19:00.790 --> 19:03.532
Looks like somebody
got here first.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.622
Betting they got
the books, too.

19:05.665 --> 19:08.277
Some hit.

19:08.320 --> 19:10.365
This wasn't just a hit.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.673
This is somebody's idea
of a party.

19:12.715 --> 19:15.588
Maybe the guy
put up a fight.

19:17.286 --> 19:19.461
We got to get going.

19:19.506 --> 19:21.421
Come on, nothing
we can do here now.

19:21.463 --> 19:23.465
[huffs]
You coming?

19:30.517 --> 19:31.996
[door closes]

19:32.039 --> 19:33.476
Mint?

19:34.607 --> 19:36.348
Didn't think so.

19:38.088 --> 19:40.482
Well, scheduling a man
of your talents

19:40.527 --> 19:43.050
is quite the chore,
I'll tell you.

19:43.094 --> 19:45.662
Between the chanting
and the sacrifice,

19:45.705 --> 19:48.011
my golf game is shot.

19:48.056 --> 19:50.798
But here... you are.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.800
You know why
I've summoned you.

19:53.844 --> 19:54.932
Can you do it?

19:56.281 --> 19:57.544
Need anything from me?

19:59.762 --> 20:01.461
You're not much
of a people person, are you?

20:01.503 --> 20:05.464
You have risked great danger
in calling on me.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.249
The deadliest magicks are needed

20:07.292 --> 20:09.250
to rob this creature
of its soul.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.165
Big job, all right.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.819
And so it shall be done.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.169
Oh, that's just swell, listen.

20:14.212 --> 20:15.518
Are you sure you don't want any?

20:15.561 --> 20:16.476
'Cause they-they're low-calorie.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.391
[chuckles]

20:18.433 --> 20:20.435
Okay.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.310
[indistinct chatter]

20:26.963 --> 20:28.443
Are you okay?

20:30.010 --> 20:32.404
Y-You seem a
little on edge.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.406
Is there anything
that's wrong?

20:34.450 --> 20:36.365
It's nothing.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.325
It's nothing.

20:39.367 --> 20:41.152
All right, all right.

20:41.195 --> 20:43.415
Stop with the third degree.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.417
It's Faith.

20:45.461 --> 20:47.723
What about her?

20:47.768 --> 20:49.726
I went to Angel's last night,

20:49.769 --> 20:51.641
and Faith was there.

20:51.684 --> 20:55.427
They looked sort of... intimate.

20:55.471 --> 20:57.430
No way. I know what
you're thinking,

20:57.472 --> 20:59.432
and no way!

20:59.474 --> 21:00.476
You're right.

21:00.519 --> 21:02.869
Faith would never do that.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.523
Faith would
totally do that.

21:04.567 --> 21:06.655
Faith was built
to do that.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.309
She's the "do that" girl.

21:08.354 --> 21:09.442
Comfort, remember?
Comfort here.

21:09.484 --> 21:11.008
I mean, please.

21:11.051 --> 21:13.445
Does Angel come up to Faith's
standards for a guy?

21:13.489 --> 21:16.404
Let's see--
is he breathing?

21:16.449 --> 21:18.929
Actually, no.

21:18.972 --> 21:21.192
But, Buffy, Angel--

21:21.236 --> 21:23.978
There's no way he
would ever do that.

21:24.020 --> 21:27.373
I mean, you're the only
thing in the world to him.

21:27.415 --> 21:30.375
Sometimes I wonder.

21:30.419 --> 21:32.813
Angel and Faith
have a lot in common.

21:34.596 --> 21:37.338
And there's so much
he doesn't tell me.

21:37.383 --> 21:38.905
But it's so clear.

21:38.949 --> 21:42.038
The way he feels about you.

21:42.083 --> 21:44.780
Buffy, I, too, know the love
of a taciturn man,

21:44.825 --> 21:48.698
and y-you have to look
at their actions.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.743
I was.

21:50.787 --> 21:53.355
Well, what did he say?

21:53.398 --> 21:55.356
"Say"?

21:55.401 --> 21:57.403
You mean
when I straightforwardly

21:57.445 --> 21:59.404
asked him what was going on?

21:59.448 --> 22:00.623
So you bailed?

22:00.666 --> 22:02.364
I couldn't.
I mean, not then--

22:02.407 --> 22:04.626
Okay, enough.

22:04.671 --> 22:07.455
Stop with the crazy.
Go talk to Angel.

22:07.500 --> 22:09.196
But I just--
No, go.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.241
I give you leave to go.

22:13.767 --> 22:15.769
Thank you.

22:26.648 --> 22:28.259
Faith.

22:28.303 --> 22:30.260
Hey.

22:30.305 --> 22:32.438
Sorry to bust in uninvited.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.614
What do you want?

22:34.656 --> 22:36.310
Look, I'm not so good
at apologies,

22:36.355 --> 22:38.661
mostly 'cause I think
the world's out to screw me,

22:38.704 --> 22:40.750
so I'm generally
more owed than owing.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.796
But I've been thinking
about last night,

22:42.838 --> 22:46.059
and I want you to know
I'm really sorry.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.670
It's all right, Faith.

22:47.713 --> 22:48.801
No, it's not all right.

22:48.845 --> 22:50.019
Yeah, I was freaked.

22:50.064 --> 22:52.021
I needed somebody.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.675
But you're with Buffy.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.503
I should know better.

22:55.548 --> 22:57.288
Okay.

23:01.162 --> 23:02.205
You don't trust me.

23:02.250 --> 23:04.470
It's not that.

23:04.512 --> 23:05.601
Hey, no problem.

23:05.644 --> 23:07.385
Join the club.

23:09.823 --> 23:11.999
Look, Faith...

23:12.041 --> 23:14.131
look, I know what
you're going through,

23:14.174 --> 23:16.655
All right?
I know how hard it can be.

23:16.699 --> 23:18.005
It's important that
you have somebody

23:18.048 --> 23:20.486
who's been there, okay?

23:20.528 --> 23:23.096
Who understands what
you're going through.

23:26.099 --> 23:27.579
I want to trust you.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.711
Chump.

23:35.631 --> 23:37.502
Yaa shaytann...

23:38.721 --> 23:39.634
...inna nafsak

23:39.679 --> 23:41.810
laa tatba'uk ba'd.

23:41.855 --> 23:43.638
Yaa rufukayl al-'azim...

23:43.682 --> 23:45.292
Faith!

23:45.336 --> 23:47.034
I wanted to do this
the old-fashioned way,

23:47.076 --> 23:48.730
but hey, your loss.

23:48.775 --> 23:50.516
I got some tricks
Buffy don't know yet.

23:50.558 --> 23:51.691
You don't have to do this.

23:51.733 --> 23:52.865
I know, but it's fun.

23:52.909 --> 23:55.477
Now relax,
it'll all be over soon.

23:55.520 --> 23:57.173
No!

23:57.218 --> 23:58.827
Yaa ruuh idhhabii!

23:58.872 --> 24:01.352
Yaa nafs idhhabii!

24:01.395 --> 24:04.573
Utrukii ayyaah wa-'trukiih

24:04.616 --> 24:07.968
nahruuman wa-najisan!

24:08.010 --> 24:11.013
[groaning]

24:42.001 --> 24:44.003
Thanks... so much.

24:46.354 --> 24:49.575
It's good to have the taste
of a slayer back in my mouth.

24:49.617 --> 24:51.228
It's like cigarettes,
you know?

24:51.271 --> 24:53.361
Just when I thought I'd quit.

24:53.403 --> 24:54.579
No.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.843
Really, don't get up.

24:59.019 --> 25:02.457
Oh, it's good to be
back in Sunnydale.

25:02.500 --> 25:03.893
Oh... nice climate.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.590
Plenty to eat.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.114
No tortured humanity
to hold me down.

25:07.156 --> 25:10.029
But you know
what bothers me?

25:10.596 --> 25:12.641
Come here!

25:12.684 --> 25:15.470
You don't seem to be getting
the big picture here, Faith.

25:15.513 --> 25:17.906
Now, I don't know why
you turned me,

25:17.951 --> 25:19.821
but let me tell you...

25:19.865 --> 25:22.432
I'm just glad you did.

25:24.609 --> 25:27.134
I got my reasons.Let me guess.

25:27.176 --> 25:29.744
You summoned back
the true Angelus because...

25:29.788 --> 25:31.486
you need a new boy toy.

25:31.529 --> 25:33.052
Sorry.

25:33.096 --> 25:34.489
Doesn't work that way.

25:37.752 --> 25:39.189
You want to be smart,
you listen to me.

25:39.232 --> 25:40.407
Funny thing
about vampires,

25:40.451 --> 25:42.148
Faith...
[grunts]

25:42.192 --> 25:45.718
We don't establish meaningful
dialogue with Slayers.

25:45.760 --> 25:47.501
Not how Buffy tells it.

25:49.634 --> 25:51.506
[laughing]

25:51.549 --> 25:53.376
I should've known
you'd like it on top.

25:53.421 --> 25:55.291
You want to listen,
or you want to die?

25:55.336 --> 25:58.208
As long as you're there,
I mostly want you to wriggle.

25:58.251 --> 25:59.601
But I'm listening.

25:59.644 --> 26:01.384
Last time you got like this,

26:01.429 --> 26:02.865
Buffy kicked your ass
all the way back to hell.

26:02.909 --> 26:04.953
Do you want to do
better this time?

26:04.998 --> 26:06.652
Still listening.

26:06.694 --> 26:07.608
Good boy.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.828
Now, all you got
to do is play nice

26:09.872 --> 26:11.221
and call truce,
and I'll hook you up

26:11.265 --> 26:13.267
with the real power
in this town.

26:13.309 --> 26:14.397
Interested?

26:14.442 --> 26:15.748
Very.

26:15.790 --> 26:18.707
Then get ready to
meet the new boss.

26:22.884 --> 26:25.758
WESLEY:
Our enemy has us
at a disadvantage.

26:25.800 --> 26:27.890
We seem consistently
to be one step behind him.

26:27.933 --> 26:31.111
Now he has
the Books of Ascension.

26:31.153 --> 26:33.679
We must take definitive action.

26:33.721 --> 26:35.636
You have the greatest voice.

26:35.681 --> 26:38.770
Have you ever thought
about doing books on tape?

26:38.814 --> 26:40.772
Way to focus, CC.

26:40.816 --> 26:42.644
Yes, let's, uh,
let's try to stay on track.

26:42.688 --> 26:44.864
We need everyone
working together here.

26:44.906 --> 26:45.907
Where's Angel?

26:45.951 --> 26:47.823
I don't know.

26:47.866 --> 26:49.781
I went to the mansion,
but he wasn't there.

26:49.825 --> 26:53.349
And Faith?

26:53.394 --> 26:54.700
She's missing, too.

26:54.742 --> 26:56.048
Which means nothing.

26:56.092 --> 26:58.224
Two unconnected events.

26:58.268 --> 27:00.705
What should we do?

27:00.749 --> 27:04.057
Buffy, I think you should try to
retrieve the Books of Ascension.

27:04.099 --> 27:05.798
Check out the mayor's office.

27:05.840 --> 27:07.233
But be damn careful.

27:07.277 --> 27:08.800
Do not confront the mayor.

27:08.844 --> 27:10.105
We don't know
a thing about him.

27:10.150 --> 27:12.239
I'll go home
and stock up on weapons.

27:12.281 --> 27:15.023
Slip into something a little
more break-and-enterish.

27:15.067 --> 27:17.330
Right.
Willow?

27:17.374 --> 27:19.507
how far did you get
with the mayor's files?

27:19.549 --> 27:20.900
Excuse me.

27:20.942 --> 27:22.030
I believe Wesley

27:22.075 --> 27:23.380
is running this meeting.

27:23.423 --> 27:24.511
WESLEY:
It's, uh,

27:24.555 --> 27:25.599
it's quite all right.

27:25.644 --> 27:26.905
Willow?

27:26.949 --> 27:28.907
It's all bad news.

27:28.951 --> 27:30.910
By the time I got through
the encryptions,

27:30.952 --> 27:32.825
the files were empty.

27:32.867 --> 27:34.826
I guess
he saw me coming.

27:34.869 --> 27:36.088
Well, what about
the hall of records?

27:36.132 --> 27:37.742
Go to the source.

27:37.786 --> 27:39.134
Good idea.

27:39.179 --> 27:40.746
There must be information
on the mayor there.

27:40.788 --> 27:42.398
Wesley, why don't you
take the group

27:42.442 --> 27:44.052
and start looking?

27:44.096 --> 27:45.402
Right.

27:45.445 --> 27:46.882
I'm in Wesley's group.

27:48.317 --> 27:49.971
There is just the one group.

27:50.016 --> 27:52.800
Yes, and I am in it.

27:52.845 --> 27:55.064
Anyone mind
if I skip the trip?

27:55.107 --> 27:57.066
I'm gonna cruise town,
keep my ear to the ground.

27:57.109 --> 27:59.199
And I think five's a crowd.

27:59.241 --> 28:01.027
It really is.

28:01.983 --> 28:03.550
Mm, I'll drive.

28:03.594 --> 28:05.814
They liked your plan.

28:10.036 --> 28:11.951
Anyone finds anything,
check in with me.

28:11.993 --> 28:14.561
Be careful.

28:20.349 --> 28:22.569
So... can I keep him?

28:22.613 --> 28:23.788
Let's just take things

28:23.832 --> 28:25.790
step by step for a moment.

28:25.834 --> 28:29.010
Now, then, Angelus--
uh, may I call you Angel?

28:29.055 --> 28:31.884
Well, actually, I'm thinking
more along the lines

28:31.926 --> 28:33.537
of you calling me Master.

28:33.580 --> 28:34.799
Ah.

28:34.843 --> 28:35.887
You know, Angelus,

28:35.931 --> 28:37.627
attitude may get you attention,

28:37.672 --> 28:39.239
but courtesy wins respect.

28:39.281 --> 28:41.153
[chuckles]
I am the one responsible

28:41.197 --> 28:42.763
for your "new" attitude.

28:42.807 --> 28:47.028
That's why I'm here.

28:47.073 --> 28:49.249
No trouble with the transition?

28:49.291 --> 28:50.816
No side effects?

28:50.858 --> 28:53.035
Hmm, had a soul.

28:53.078 --> 28:54.689
Now I'm free.

28:54.732 --> 28:55.907
That's terrific.

28:55.951 --> 28:57.344
Poetic, too.

28:57.386 --> 28:59.172
Not that I read
much poetry.

28:59.214 --> 29:00.826
Except for those little ones
in the Reader's Digest.

29:00.868 --> 29:03.698
You know, some are quite catchy.
[laughs]

29:03.741 --> 29:05.134
Hey, I don't mean
to rush things here,

29:05.178 --> 29:08.007
but are you trying to get
to some kind of a point?

29:08.049 --> 29:10.400
Heh. Kids today--
rush, rush, rush.

29:10.443 --> 29:14.056
The point, Angel, is you're
a very powerful young man.

29:14.099 --> 29:15.013
Good for Faith.

29:15.057 --> 29:16.231
And there just may be
a future for you

29:16.276 --> 29:18.886
here in Sunnydale.

29:18.931 --> 29:21.063
I see you're admiring
my letter opener.

29:21.106 --> 29:22.804
Well, actually,
I was thinking

29:22.847 --> 29:24.980
of stabbing you
through the heart with it.

29:26.328 --> 29:27.766
Please do.

29:36.338 --> 29:38.427
Nice shot.

29:50.092 --> 29:51.963
You see,

29:52.007 --> 29:54.052
I'm what you might call...

29:54.096 --> 29:56.271
impervious.

29:56.316 --> 29:58.884
Can't be killed
or harmed in any way.

29:58.926 --> 30:00.711
And that's just a cornerstone

30:00.755 --> 30:02.234
in my plans for this...

30:02.278 --> 30:04.977
great town of ours.

30:05.019 --> 30:06.847
Mm-hmm, can't
be killed,

30:06.892 --> 30:09.023
but you don't like germs.Yuck!

30:09.067 --> 30:11.634
Ew. Awful things.
Unsanitary.

30:11.679 --> 30:14.900
But my question is now that
Faith has brought you back,

30:14.942 --> 30:16.291
what are your intentions?

30:16.336 --> 30:18.119
Well, gee, sir,
I thought I'd find

30:18.163 --> 30:20.122
that slayer that's
giving you so much trouble

30:20.165 --> 30:22.255
and torture, maim,

30:22.298 --> 30:24.910
and kill her.

30:24.952 --> 30:27.041
Fine.
[chuckles]

30:27.086 --> 30:28.565
You know, it's nice to see
you're not one of those

30:28.608 --> 30:30.698
slacker types
running around town today.

30:30.740 --> 30:32.003
[chuckles]
Yeah, yeah.

30:32.047 --> 30:33.569
Torture Buffy.

30:33.614 --> 30:35.528
Uh, killing her's fine,
just make it a slow one.

30:35.572 --> 30:37.009
My favorite kind.

30:37.051 --> 30:38.575
Wonderful.
Wonderful.

30:38.618 --> 30:40.229
We don't want a replacement
slayer anytime soon.

30:40.272 --> 30:41.361
They can't all turn out

30:41.403 --> 30:44.364
like my girl Faith.

30:44.406 --> 30:45.712
Have fun.

30:45.756 --> 30:47.148
Let's do it.

30:49.194 --> 30:51.326
Um...

30:51.371 --> 30:54.026
try to have her home by 11:00.

30:58.943 --> 31:01.163
[door closes]

31:01.207 --> 31:03.904
She's not
a little girl anymore.

31:03.949 --> 31:05.951
[sniffles]

31:05.993 --> 31:07.821
[imitating Cordelia]:
I love when you talk, Wesley.

31:07.865 --> 31:10.172
I love when you sing,
Wesley.

31:10.215 --> 31:12.740
[normal voice]:
Can you say the words
"jail bait," Wesley?

31:12.782 --> 31:14.567
Limey bastard.

31:14.611 --> 31:16.352
Hey, guys.
Man, where you been?

31:16.395 --> 31:18.397
You got to find Buffy.
She's going to her place

31:18.441 --> 31:20.355
and stock up--
[grunts]

31:20.400 --> 31:23.142
That guy just bugs me.

31:23.184 --> 31:25.752
[crickets trilling]

31:29.974 --> 31:31.105
Faith, Angel.

31:31.150 --> 31:32.586
Hi, Joyce.
Nice to see you.

31:32.628 --> 31:33.630
Is Buffy home?

31:33.673 --> 31:35.849
Upstairs.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.113
Please tell me it's not
some vampire thing.

31:38.156 --> 31:40.201
The only vampire
here is me, Joyce.

31:40.246 --> 31:43.249
Say, you change
your hair?

31:44.815 --> 31:46.730
Highlights.

31:46.773 --> 31:48.950
It's nice.

31:57.872 --> 31:59.874
Knock, knock.

32:02.789 --> 32:03.964
Where have you guys been?

32:04.009 --> 32:05.314
Looking for you.

32:05.357 --> 32:07.055
Good thing we found you
before you left.

32:09.013 --> 32:10.971
We got the books.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.669
They're at the mansion.

32:12.712 --> 32:14.323
We'd take them
to Giles ourselves,

32:14.366 --> 32:17.282
but I think strength in numbers
is the way to go, come on.

32:20.154 --> 32:22.375
Let me get those for you.

32:32.124 --> 32:34.082
Okay, let's get
the books someplace safe.

32:34.125 --> 32:35.126
Where are they?

32:35.170 --> 32:38.086
Actually,

32:38.130 --> 32:40.480
we have a slight
change in plan, Buff.

32:40.522 --> 32:42.873
"Buff"?

32:42.916 --> 32:45.049
You just called--

32:45.093 --> 32:47.051
What's the matter
with you?

32:47.095 --> 32:48.009
Nothing.

32:48.052 --> 32:51.795
Matter of fact,
I haven't felt

32:51.838 --> 32:53.710
this good in
a long time.

32:53.753 --> 32:55.494
Angel?

32:55.538 --> 32:58.019
You know, I never
properly thanked you

32:58.063 --> 33:00.065
for sending me to hell.

33:00.107 --> 33:01.153
No...

33:01.195 --> 33:02.501
Yeah, and I'm
just wondering

33:02.545 --> 33:03.676
where do I start?

33:03.720 --> 33:04.721
Card?

33:04.765 --> 33:06.635
Fruit basket, huh?

33:06.680 --> 33:08.247
Evisceration?No.

33:08.289 --> 33:09.943
Yeah, I know what
you're thinking.

33:09.988 --> 33:12.119
Maybe there's still some good
deep down inside of me

33:12.163 --> 33:13.948
that remembers
and loves you.

33:13.991 --> 33:16.080
If only you could reach me.

33:16.124 --> 33:18.473
Then again, we have reality.

33:20.085 --> 33:23.435
I will kill you
before I let you touch me.

33:26.090 --> 33:28.875
Faith, we need to get
out of here... now!

33:28.919 --> 33:31.313
Speak for yourself, B.

33:31.356 --> 33:34.534
Me?
I like it here.

33:43.020 --> 33:44.892
One thing I learned
about Buffy--

33:44.934 --> 33:46.067
she's so cute

33:46.111 --> 33:47.547
when she's sleeping.

33:47.589 --> 33:49.156
Hmm.

33:55.468 --> 33:57.470
Hey, I know a way
to make investigating

33:57.512 --> 33:59.253
the mayor even more boring.

34:01.473 --> 34:04.303
On second thought,
no, I don't.

34:04.346 --> 34:07.000
Hey.
Whoa.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.351
WILLOW:
Whoa.

34:09.393 --> 34:11.135
Big "hey, whoa."
Guys, check this out.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.922
Wow. Like father,

34:16.967 --> 34:18.360
like son.

34:18.402 --> 34:19.927
OZ:
How about like exact same guy

34:19.969 --> 34:21.494
like exact same guy?

34:21.536 --> 34:25.324
Mayor Wilkins
is over 100 years old.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.326
He's not human.

34:27.369 --> 34:29.719
I, uh, hate
to spoil the mood,

34:29.762 --> 34:32.286
but this is so much
worse than you think.

34:32.331 --> 34:34.942
Xander, what happened to you?

34:34.985 --> 34:37.161
You know how some people
hate to say I told you so?

34:37.204 --> 34:39.599
Not me.
I told you so.

34:39.641 --> 34:42.556
Angel's back,
in the really bad sense.

34:42.601 --> 34:45.126
And, um, I told you so.

34:45.170 --> 34:48.347
Angelus has turned?

34:48.389 --> 34:50.262
Xander, this is
terribly serious.

34:50.304 --> 34:51.739
Are you sure?

34:51.784 --> 34:53.351
Gee, let me think.

34:53.393 --> 34:54.744
Kind of hard to tell.

34:54.788 --> 34:56.614
Last thing I remember
is his fist.

34:56.659 --> 34:58.617
We must contact Giles
immediately.

34:58.661 --> 35:01.402
Good thinking-- let's waste
time with a lively debate.

35:01.447 --> 35:03.362
Leave Buffy alone,
see how dead she gets.

35:03.405 --> 35:04.840
Slow down, Xander.

35:04.885 --> 35:06.800
This isn't Wesley's fault.

35:06.842 --> 35:08.409
Actually, it is.

35:08.454 --> 35:10.282
Faith was your responsibility.

35:10.324 --> 35:12.980
Guess who's
Angel's new playmate?

35:13.023 --> 35:15.155
Faith and Angel?
Together?

35:15.199 --> 35:18.202
Imagine the possibilities.

35:18.246 --> 35:19.900
[chains rattling]

35:22.336 --> 35:24.034
[handcuffs lock]

35:24.077 --> 35:26.559
Morning,
sleepyhead.

35:26.601 --> 35:28.429
[moans]

35:28.474 --> 35:29.865
You know what
I just can't believe?

35:29.909 --> 35:31.824
All of our time together
and we never tried chains.

35:33.652 --> 35:36.177
Well, can't dwell on the past.

35:36.221 --> 35:39.179
Especially with the
future we have ahead.

35:41.356 --> 35:44.097
Bondage looks good on you, B.

35:44.141 --> 35:46.534
The outfit's all wrong,
but hey...

35:46.579 --> 35:48.885
You don't know
what you're doing.
Really?

35:48.929 --> 35:52.454
Weird, 'cause something about
all this just feels so right.

35:52.498 --> 35:54.978
Maybe it's one of those
unhappy childhood things.

35:55.021 --> 35:57.981
See, when I was a kid, I used
to beg my mom for a dog.

35:58.025 --> 35:59.592
Didn't matter what kind.

35:59.635 --> 36:03.596
I just wanted, you know,
something to love.

36:11.038 --> 36:12.822
A dog's all I wanted.

36:12.865 --> 36:16.043
Well, that and toys.

36:18.436 --> 36:20.351
But mom was so busy,

36:20.394 --> 36:22.309
you know,
enjoying the drinking

36:22.353 --> 36:23.572
and passing out parts of life

36:23.615 --> 36:25.487
that I never really
got what I wanted.

36:25.530 --> 36:27.402
Until now.

36:27.445 --> 36:30.231
Faith, listen to me
very closely.

36:30.275 --> 36:31.666
Angel's a killer.

36:31.710 --> 36:33.494
When he's done with me,
he'll turn on you.

36:33.539 --> 36:35.367
She's right.

36:35.409 --> 36:37.891
I probably will.

36:37.934 --> 36:39.239
Yeah?

36:39.284 --> 36:41.023
Huh.

36:41.068 --> 36:43.070
Guess we'll just have to keep
you around a while, then.

36:44.898 --> 36:46.072
Before we get started,

36:46.115 --> 36:47.596
I just want you to know...

36:47.639 --> 36:49.163
if you're a screamer,

36:49.206 --> 36:51.338
feel free.

36:51.382 --> 36:52.949
Why, Faith?

36:52.992 --> 36:54.168
What's in it for you?

36:54.211 --> 36:55.603
What isn't?

36:55.648 --> 36:57.518
You know, I come to
Sunnydale, I'm a slayer,

36:57.563 --> 36:59.434
I do my job kicking ass
better than anyone.

36:59.478 --> 37:01.914
What do I hear about
everywhere I go?

37:01.958 --> 37:04.177
Buffy.

37:04.222 --> 37:05.875
So I slay,
I behave,

37:05.918 --> 37:07.398
I do the good
little girl routine,

37:07.442 --> 37:08.487
and who does
everybody thank?

37:08.530 --> 37:11.097
Buffy.

37:11.141 --> 37:13.143
That's not my fault.

37:13.186 --> 37:14.449
Everyone always asks,

37:14.492 --> 37:16.407
"Why can't you
be more like Buffy?"

37:16.451 --> 37:19.106
But did anyone ever ask
if you could be more like me?

37:19.148 --> 37:20.324
I know I didn't.

37:21.804 --> 37:24.545
You get the watcher,

37:24.590 --> 37:26.155
you get the mom,
you get the little Scooby Gang.

37:26.199 --> 37:28.114
What do I get?
Jack squat.

37:28.157 --> 37:29.637
This was supposed
to be my town!

37:29.681 --> 37:30.769
Faith, listen to me!

37:30.813 --> 37:32.510
Why?

37:32.554 --> 37:34.860
So you can impart some special
Buffy wisdom, that it?

37:34.903 --> 37:35.905
Do you think you're
better than me?

37:35.949 --> 37:36.949
Do you?

37:36.992 --> 37:38.081
Say it.

37:38.125 --> 37:39.344
You think you're better than me.

37:39.387 --> 37:40.606
I am.

37:43.956 --> 37:45.914
Always have been.

37:45.958 --> 37:48.701
Um, maybe you didn't notice.

37:48.744 --> 37:51.224
Angel's with me.

37:52.530 --> 37:55.184
And how did you get him, Faith?

37:55.228 --> 37:56.317
Magic?

37:56.360 --> 37:58.666
You cast
some sort of spell?

37:58.710 --> 38:01.190
Because in the real world,

38:01.235 --> 38:04.456
Angel would never touch you,
and we both know it.

38:04.498 --> 38:05.413
[grunts]

38:09.416 --> 38:12.159
You had to tie me up to beat me.

38:12.202 --> 38:14.161
There's a word
for people like you, Faith.

38:14.204 --> 38:15.989
"Loser."

38:17.295 --> 38:19.253
Uh-huh.

38:19.297 --> 38:22.561
You're just trying to make
me mad so I'll kill you.

38:22.603 --> 38:24.563
But I'm too smart for that.

38:24.606 --> 38:26.172
Stick around.

38:27.652 --> 38:28.610
For what?

38:28.653 --> 38:30.612
Your boss' lame ascension?

38:30.655 --> 38:32.179
Like I couldn't stop it.

38:33.266 --> 38:35.704
You can't.
[chuckles]

38:35.748 --> 38:36.965
I will.

38:37.010 --> 38:38.054
Keep dreaming.

38:38.097 --> 38:39.403
No one can stop the ascension.

38:39.447 --> 38:40.840
Mayor's got it wired, B.

38:40.882 --> 38:42.623
He built this town
for demons to feed on,

38:42.668 --> 38:45.452
and come graduation day,
he's gettin' paid.

38:45.496 --> 38:47.498
And I'll be sittin'
at his right hand.

38:47.541 --> 38:49.936
Assuming he has hands
after the transformation.

38:49.978 --> 38:51.590
I'm not too clear on that part.

38:51.632 --> 38:54.157
And all
your little lame-ass friends

38:54.201 --> 38:55.985
are gonna be kibbles and bits.

38:56.028 --> 38:57.813
Think about that
when your boyfriend's

38:57.856 --> 39:00.206
cutting into you.

39:00.250 --> 39:03.210
I never knew
you had so much rage in you.

39:03.253 --> 39:05.038
What can I say?

39:05.081 --> 39:07.780
I'm the world's
best actor.

39:07.822 --> 39:09.782
Second best.

39:19.094 --> 39:20.619
Graduation day.

39:20.661 --> 39:22.228
You think we missed anything?

39:22.271 --> 39:24.579
I think
we know everything she knows.

39:25.666 --> 39:27.626
May I say something?

39:29.148 --> 39:30.672
[chains rattle]

39:30.715 --> 39:32.065
Psych.

39:32.108 --> 39:34.806
You played me. You played me!

39:35.503 --> 39:38.027
[grunting]

39:45.947 --> 39:48.036
[panting]

39:50.952 --> 39:54.260
What are you gonna do, B?
Kill me?

39:54.304 --> 39:56.481
You become me.

39:56.523 --> 39:59.657
You're not ready for that.

39:59.701 --> 40:00.398
[grunts]
Yet.

40:04.836 --> 40:07.360
Are you okay?

40:16.936 --> 40:19.329
The task is finished.Yes.

40:19.373 --> 40:21.070
Thank you for
coming to me

40:21.114 --> 40:24.030
and for that rather effective
light show you put on.

40:24.072 --> 40:27.119
This restores the balance
between us, Rupert Giles.

40:27.163 --> 40:28.512
My debt
to you

40:28.556 --> 40:30.862
is now repaid in full.

40:30.905 --> 40:32.733
Do not call upon me again.

40:32.777 --> 40:34.300
I shan't.

40:34.344 --> 40:35.476
Peace with you.

40:35.519 --> 40:38.086
And with you.

40:47.574 --> 40:50.186
His debt to you is repaid?
What did you do?

40:50.230 --> 40:52.362
I introduced him to his wife.

40:52.405 --> 40:54.364
WESLEY:
Well, I,

40:54.407 --> 40:55.713
for one, protest.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.715
You've pitted slayer
against slayer

40:57.759 --> 40:58.934
in a dangerous charade

40:58.978 --> 41:00.893
that could've
gotten them both killed.

41:00.936 --> 41:02.764
Without informing me.

41:04.722 --> 41:06.507
I'm telling the council.

41:06.550 --> 41:07.552
I think you should.

41:07.594 --> 41:09.945
We have a rogue slayer
on our hands.

41:09.989 --> 41:12.773
I can't think
of anything more dangerous.

41:12.818 --> 41:14.601
At least now we know.

41:14.646 --> 41:18.737
And we know a little bit more
about the ascension.

41:18.780 --> 41:20.608
Graduation day.

41:20.652 --> 41:24.132
There's a big, scary un-fun.

41:24.177 --> 41:25.570
At least

41:25.612 --> 41:26.918
Angel's not bad though.

41:26.961 --> 41:29.574
That's good,
right?Yes,

41:29.617 --> 41:31.576
I feel so much better knowing
that he broke my face

41:31.619 --> 41:35.231
in the good way.
It's a good bruise.

41:35.275 --> 41:37.277
He was only acting, Xander.

41:39.278 --> 41:41.454
It was just an act.

41:41.498 --> 41:43.804
WILKINS:
Well, you win some,
you lose some.

41:43.849 --> 41:46.373
From where I'm sitting, it's
batting average that counts.

41:46.416 --> 41:49.376
So you lost
some friends.

41:49.418 --> 41:51.596
I wouldn't exactly call them
friends.

41:51.639 --> 41:53.945
Well, then what are you
worried about? Chin up.

41:53.989 --> 41:55.730
You don't see me looking
disappointed, do ya?

41:55.773 --> 41:57.688
Heck no. You know why?
Because I know

41:57.731 --> 41:59.690
you'll always
have me, Faith.

41:59.733 --> 42:02.128
I'm the best, the most important
friend you'll ever have.

42:02.170 --> 42:04.652
Besides, you know,
once the ascension starts,

42:04.695 --> 42:06.610
that "in crowd" you're
so concerned about,

42:06.653 --> 42:08.612
whew, they'll be lucky if
there's enough of them left

42:08.655 --> 42:11.179
to fill a pothole. Promise.

42:13.226 --> 42:15.184
Still
unhappy?

42:15.228 --> 42:17.751
Hmm.

42:18.840 --> 42:21.800
Okeydoke.

42:21.842 --> 42:23.583
I've got two words

42:23.628 --> 42:26.847
that are gonna make
all the pain go away.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.722
Miniature... golf.

42:30.764 --> 42:32.288
[chuckles]

42:36.030 --> 42:38.556
[chuckles]

42:50.871 --> 42:53.309
How you doin'?

42:53.353 --> 42:55.833
Been better.

42:55.876 --> 42:57.835
Not hard to believe.

42:57.878 --> 43:00.664
You were a real soldier
last night, Buffy.

43:00.708 --> 43:01.666
That's me.

43:01.708 --> 43:03.668
One of the troops.

43:03.710 --> 43:05.320
I know
how hard

43:05.364 --> 43:06.670
it was for you.

43:06.713 --> 43:08.847
I really doubt that.

43:08.889 --> 43:12.501
If there's anything I can do
to make it better...

43:12.545 --> 43:15.505
[exhales]
Look,

43:15.548 --> 43:18.204
I know you only did
what I asked,

43:18.246 --> 43:20.902
and we-we got what we wanted.

43:20.945 --> 43:25.036
I-I never wanted it
to go that far.

43:25.079 --> 43:26.820
I know that.

43:26.864 --> 43:30.563
It's not even a question
of that.

43:30.608 --> 43:32.130
It's just...

43:32.173 --> 43:34.742
after...

43:36.135 --> 43:39.485
I need a little bit of a break.

43:42.880 --> 43:44.925
Please?

43:53.413 --> 43:55.849
You still my girl?

43:59.940 --> 44:02.161
Always.

44:46.204 --> 44:48.815
Grr. Argh.
