03:34.631 --> 03:37.543
'I don't know about you,
but it always makes me sore

03:37.676 --> 03:41.009
'when I see those war pictures
about flying leathernecks

03:41.138 --> 03:45.472
'and submarine patrols and frogmen
and guerrillas in the Philippines.

03:45.600 --> 03:49.218
'What gets me is that there never
w-w-was a movie about p.O.W.S

03:49.354 --> 03:51.766
'about prisoners of war.

03:51.898 --> 03:55.732
'My name is Clarence Harvey cook,
they call me cookie.

03:55.861 --> 03:59.604
'I was shot down over magdeburg,
Germany, back in '43.

03:59.740 --> 04:03.824
'That's why I stammer once in a while,
especially when I get excited.

04:03.952 --> 04:07.661
'I spent two and a half years
in stalag 17.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.121
"Stalag" is the German word
for prison camp.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.117
'And number 17 was somewhere
on the danube.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.414
"There were about
40,000 p.O.W.S there,

04:15.547 --> 04:19.130
'if you bother to count the Russians,
the poles and the Czechs.

04:19.259 --> 04:22.376
'In our compound,
there were about 630 of us.

'All American airmen: Radio operators,
gunners and engineers. All sergeants.

04:28.769 --> 04:34.810
'Now, put 630 sergeants together and,
oh mother, you've got yourself a situation!

04:34.941 --> 04:38.274
"There was more fireworks
shooting off around that joint...

04:38.403 --> 04:41.987
'Take, for instance, the story
about the spy we had in our barracks.

'It was about a week

Animal? Animal! Get up!

06:05.156 --> 06:07.738
Betty grable's on the phone!

06:29.681 --> 06:31.797
- Here's your civilian clothes.
- Ok, hoffy.

06:31.933 --> 06:35.721
Remember, bury your army outfits
before you get out of the forest.

06:35.854 --> 06:38.561
Your compass is the top button
of this jacket.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.937
Anybody asks for your papers,
you're French labourers.

06:47.073 --> 06:50.782
Here's your map,
kraut money, Swiss francs.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.276
Roger.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.932
- Let's hear it once more.
- We've been over it a hundred times.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.408
Let's hear it again.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.248
We stick to the forest going west
till we hit the danube.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.493
Then we follow the danube
up to linz.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.791
In linz, we hop a barge
and go to ulm.

07:07.636 --> 07:11.629
Stop it, Joey!
Joey, go back to sleep!

07:14.476 --> 07:16.558
Goon. You'rein ulm.

07:16.686 --> 07:19.849
We lie low until night,
then take a train to friedrichshafen.

07:19.981 --> 07:22.472
We steal a rowboat,
get some fishing tackle

07:22.609 --> 07:27.023
and drift south across the lake,
till we hit the other side - Switzerland.

07:27.155 --> 07:32.400
Once there, give out a big yodel,
so we know you're there. It's a breeze.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.402
- Stay out of this.
- Just one question.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.904
Did you calculate the risk?

07:40.835 --> 07:42.371
Ready!

07:43.505 --> 07:45.837
You've got ten minutes
to get through the tunnel.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.673
You'll come out as the jerries
are changing shifts.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.837
Blondie?

07:52.222 --> 07:54.884
- Ok.
- Peel off.

07:55.016 --> 07:58.349
- Show 'em, boys.
- We're with you, all of us.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.264
- We'll miss you cruds.
- Auf wiedersehen.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.923
They ought to be
under the barbed wire soon.

09:20.060 --> 09:21.391
Looks good outside.

09:21.519 --> 09:23.305
I hope they hit
the danube before dawn.

09:23.438 --> 09:26.100
They got a good chance.
It's the longest night of the year.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.315
- I bet they make it to friedrichshafen.
- I bet they reach Switzerland.

09:29.444 --> 09:33.858
- I bet they don't get out of the forest.
- What kind of crack is that?

09:33.990 --> 09:37.448
No crack. Two packs of cigarettes
say they don't get out of the forest.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.909
That's enough, sefton.
Crawl back in your sack.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.120
He'd bet on his mother
getting hit by a truck!

09:42.248 --> 09:43.863
- Anybody call?
- Sefton, butt out!

09:44.000 --> 09:47.458
Wait a minute. I wanna back
those kids. I'll cover ten of that.

09:47.587 --> 09:48.872
- I'll take five.
- Eight.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.916
- Put me down for ten.
- Three.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.711
- I'll take one.
- I'll cover the whole pot.

09:53.843 --> 09:56.425
Anything you say. Cookie?

09:56.554 --> 09:58.545
More cigarettes.

09:59.557 --> 10:02.390
- Speak up, boys.
- I'll cover eight.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.759
Here's four.

10:03.895 --> 10:05.510
- Here's two.
- Here's four.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.433
- And four more.
- I'll cover eight.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.476
- Give me three.
- I bet two.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.349
- And a half!
- No butts.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.272
No butts, no butts.

10:13.404 --> 10:16.942
- W-w-will this do or you want more?
- That'll do.

10:17.075 --> 10:20.488
Speak up, boys.
Any more sports in the crowd?

11:04.247 --> 11:05.703
Let's go.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.722
Those filthy krauts!

11:29.647 --> 11:32.559
- What's left of them, hoffy?
- Don't ask me.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.354
Price was elected security.

11:35.486 --> 11:38.603
- Ok, what happened?
- I wish I knew.

11:38.740 --> 11:41.026
We had everything figured out
to the last detail.

11:41.159 --> 11:43.241
Maybe the krauts knew
about the tunnel all the time!

11:43.369 --> 11:45.735
- Shut up!
- Maybe they were laying for them.

11:45.872 --> 11:49.490
- Yeah, maybe.
- Hold it, sefton. I said, hold it!

11:49.626 --> 11:52.868
So we heard some shots.
Who says they didn't get away?

11:55.632 --> 11:58.544
Anybody here
want to double their bet?

12:22.242 --> 12:25.450
'Every morning at six
on the dot, they'd have the appell.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.239
"That's" roll callâ to you.

12:27.372 --> 12:29.738
'Every barracks
had its own alarm clock.

12:29.874 --> 12:35.335
'Our alarm clock was feldwebel schulz.
Johann Sebastian schulz.

12:35.463 --> 12:38.330
'I understand the krauts
had a composer way back

12:38.466 --> 12:40.422
'with a Johann Sebastian in it.

12:40.551 --> 12:44.590
"But I can tell you one thing,
schulz was no composer.

12:44.722 --> 12:49.307
'He was a schweinehund.
Was he ever a lousy schweinehund.'

12:56.109 --> 12:59.772
Gentlemen, you must get out
for roll call!

12:59.904 --> 13:01.769
Good morning to you.

13:03.283 --> 13:06.775
Ok, everybody, get up, get out!

13:11.374 --> 13:15.162
Ok, come on, you sack rats.
Cut the beefing and get up!

13:15.295 --> 13:19.334
Hey, schulz. Did you guys have some
machine-gun practice last night?

13:19.465 --> 13:23.754
Oh, terrible! Such foolish boys.
Such nice boys.

13:23.886 --> 13:27.970
I'd better not talk about it.
It makes me sick to my stomach.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.926
Roll call, everybody out!

13:33.062 --> 13:35.098
You killed them? Both of them?

13:35.231 --> 13:38.348
- Such nice boys. It makes me sick...
- Don't wear it out!

13:38.484 --> 13:41.647
You too. Put away that piccolo.

13:43.323 --> 13:47.032
Lay off, schulz. He has a sickness.
You know he's krank.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.197
Sometimes I think he's fooling us
with that crazy business.

13:50.330 --> 13:54.164
Would you like to see the guts
of nine pals splattered over your plane?

13:54.292 --> 13:56.954
Come on, Joey. Don't be afraid.

13:57.086 --> 14:00.203
Please, gentlemen.

14:00.340 --> 14:04.504
You don't want to stay in bed
on such a beautiful morning.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.091
- Schulz?
- Yeah?

14:07.055 --> 14:08.761
- Sprechen sie deutsch?
- Jawobhl...

14:08.890 --> 14:11.427
Then, droppen sie dead!

14:11.559 --> 14:15.393
Always mit zee jokes. Roll call!

14:16.606 --> 14:19.894
Wake up, animal.
Come on, animal, wake up.

14:22.570 --> 14:27.155
Good morning, animal.
What would you like for breakfast?

14:27.283 --> 14:31.947
Scrambled eggs with little sausages?
Bacon and eggs sunny-side up?

14:32.080 --> 14:36.369
- Griddle cakes, a waffle...
- Stop it, Harry. I'm warnin' ya.

14:36.501 --> 14:39.789
Coffee, milk
or maybe a little cocoa.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.333
Why do you do this to me
every morning?

14:42.465 --> 14:44.376
Hamburgers and onions,
strawberry shortcake...

14:44.509 --> 14:48.969
- I'll kill you, Harry, so help me.
- Let go, animal, it's roll call!

14:50.473 --> 14:52.839
Hitler is waiting to see us.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.682
Let's see,
we have two empty bunks here.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.770
Suppose you let those mattresses
cool off a little out of decency?

15:02.902 --> 15:09.239
Ja, we're cramped for space.
New prisoners coming in every day.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.153
Now, gentlemen, outside, please!

15:11.285 --> 15:14.869
You don't want me in trouble
with the kommandant again? Outside.

15:14.997 --> 15:19.832
Schulz, if you're moving somebody in,
how about some Russian broads?

15:19.961 --> 15:22.452
- Russian women prisoners?
- Jawohl.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.579
Some are not bad at all.

15:24.715 --> 15:28.003
Just get us a couple
with beautiful glockenspiels.

15:30.680 --> 15:33.262
- Droppen sie dead! Raus!
- R-r-r-aus/

15:33.391 --> 15:35.632
down boy, down! Down!

15:45.153 --> 15:47.439
All right, men, fall in!

16:30.072 --> 16:32.984
Achtung! Attention!
Der kommandant.

16:47.298 --> 16:49.254
Guten morgen, sergeants.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.970
Nasty weather we are having, eh?

16:56.098 --> 16:59.465
And I so much hoped
we could give you a white Christmas,

16:59.602 --> 17:02.719
just like the ones you used to know.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.767
Aren't those the words
that clever little man wrote,

17:05.900 --> 17:08.232
the one who stole his name
from our capital,

17:08.361 --> 17:10.852
that something-or-other Berlin?

17:14.032 --> 17:16.148
Look at that mud.

17:16.285 --> 17:20.618
Come spring...
I hope you'll still be with us next spring.

17:20.748 --> 17:22.989
We shall plant some grass here.

17:23.125 --> 17:25.741
And perhaps some daffodils.

17:34.387 --> 17:37.754
I understand we are
minus two men this morning.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.632
I am surprised at you, gentlemen.

17:40.768 --> 17:45.432
Here I am, trying to be your friend,
and you do embarrassing things to me.

17:45.565 --> 17:49.399
You know this could get me
into hot water with the high command?

17:49.527 --> 17:54.897
They would court-martial me,
after all these years of a perfect record.

17:55.032 --> 17:58.945
You wouldn't want that
to happen to me, would you?

17:59.078 --> 18:01.740
Fortunately, those two men...

18:14.010 --> 18:19.755
As I was saying, fortunately
those two men did not get very far.

18:19.890 --> 18:24.850
They had the good sense to rejoin us,
so my record stands unblemished.

18:24.979 --> 18:29.473
Nobody has ever escaped
from stalag 17.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.725
Not alive, anyway.

18:47.251 --> 18:50.835
- Sergeant Hoffman of barracks 4.
- Yes, sergeant Hoffman?

18:50.963 --> 18:55.423
As compound chief, I protest the way
these bodies are left lying in the mud.

18:55.551 --> 18:57.257
- Anything else?
- Yes.

18:57.386 --> 18:59.001
According to the Geneva convention,

18:59.138 --> 19:01.345
dead prisoners are to be given
a decent burial.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.432
Of course. I am aware
of the Geneva convention.

19:04.560 --> 19:06.972
They'll be given
the burial they deserve.

19:08.147 --> 19:12.015
Or perhaps you'd suggest we haul in
21 cannons from the eastern front

19:12.151 --> 19:14.767
and give them a 21-gun salute?

19:20.493 --> 19:24.031
For the last time, gentlemen,
let me remind you.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.280
Any prisoners found
outside the barracks after lights out

19:27.416 --> 19:29.452
will be shot on sight.

19:29.585 --> 19:33.419
Furthermore,
the iron stove in barrack 4,

19:33.547 --> 19:37.085
the one camouflaging the trap door,
will be removed.

19:37.218 --> 19:40.836
And so the men from this barrack
do not suffer from the cold,

19:40.971 --> 19:44.884
they will keep warm
by filling in the escape tunnel.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.224
Is that clear?

19:49.522 --> 19:53.515
All right, then, gentlemen,
we are all friends again.

19:53.651 --> 19:56.984
And with Christmas coming,
I have a special treat for you.

19:57.113 --> 20:00.605
I'll have you all deloused
for the holidays.

20:00.741 --> 20:06.828
And I'll have a little Christmas tree
for every barrack. You will like that.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.544
Who did this?

20:17.883 --> 20:22.593
I will give the funny man exactly
five seconds to step forward.

20:25.266 --> 20:29.885
Then you'll all stand here
if it takes all day and all night.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.351
That is better.

20:47.872 --> 20:50.079
600 funny men.

20:51.584 --> 20:54.121
There will be no Christmas trees,

20:54.253 --> 20:58.087
but there will be delousing
with ice water from the hoses.

20:58.215 --> 20:59.375
Dismissed!

21:33.250 --> 21:35.411
Guten morgen.

21:35.544 --> 21:39.628
We will remove the iron stove
camouflaging the trap door...

21:39.757 --> 21:41.918
I'm telling you, animal,
these Nazis ain't kosher.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.712
You can say that again.

21:43.844 --> 21:45.684
I'm telling you, animal,
these Nazis ain't k...

21:45.721 --> 21:49.714
I said you could say it again,
that doesn't mean you have to repeat it!

21:52.436 --> 21:54.301
Private property, bub.

21:55.898 --> 21:59.937
How come the krauts knew about
that stove, security? And the tunnel?

22:00.069 --> 22:02.651
Why can't you lay down a belch
without them knowing?

22:02.780 --> 22:05.396
If you don't like the way
I'm handling this job...

22:05.533 --> 22:09.902
- It's got us all spinning.
- What makes them krauts so smart?

22:10.037 --> 22:13.529
Maybe they do have radar.
Maybe there's a Mike hidden somewhere.

22:13.666 --> 22:16.703
Yeah, right up Joey's ocarina.

22:17.878 --> 22:21.462
Maybe they're not so smart,
but we're so stupid.

22:21.590 --> 22:24.582
Maybe someone in our barracks
is tipping them off, like one of us!

22:24.718 --> 22:27.380
- You don't say?
- Yes, I do say!

22:27.513 --> 22:30.004
One of us is a dirty, stinking stoolie!

22:30.140 --> 22:32.722
Is that Einstein's theory
or did you pick it out yourself?

22:32.852 --> 22:36.891
Hey! New dames
in the Russian compound!

22:44.947 --> 22:47.188
New dames
in the Russian compound!

22:52.997 --> 22:56.080
Oh, you sweethearts!
Let's open up the third front!

23:01.088 --> 23:05.627
Hey, dames, how about
a little borscht, just the two of us?

23:05.759 --> 23:09.502
Hey, russki, russki!
Look at those bublichkis!

23:13.017 --> 23:15.929
Hey, look at me! I'm your baby!

23:16.061 --> 23:19.394
Get a load of that blonde.
She's built like a brick kremlin.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.263
Hey, comrade! Here I am!

23:21.400 --> 23:24.813
Harry shapiro,
the volga boatman of barracks 4.

23:24.945 --> 23:27.277
Lay off, the blonde is mine!

23:32.494 --> 23:36.237
Hey, Olga, volga! Wait for me!

23:39.627 --> 23:41.117
- Let me go!
- They'll shoot you.

23:41.253 --> 23:46.373
- They'll shoot you, animal.
- 1 don't care. Let me go!

23:46.508 --> 23:49.090
Chow! Chow!

23:49.219 --> 23:51.255
- Chow, animal, chow!
- I don't want to eat.

23:51.388 --> 23:54.346
I want to go over there
and just talk with them.

23:54.475 --> 23:57.262
You don't want to talk to broads
with boots on.

23:57.394 --> 23:59.180
I don't care if they wear galoshes.

23:59.313 --> 24:02.476
- You want Betty grable.
- Let me go!

24:02.608 --> 24:06.271
I told you when the war's over,
I'll get you a date with Betty grable.

24:06.403 --> 24:09.440
How are you going to get me
a date with Betty grable?

24:09.573 --> 24:11.780
How? We go to California.

24:11.909 --> 24:16.198
My cousin works for the Los Angeles
gas company. He'll get the address.

24:16.330 --> 24:19.322
Then we go to the house and
when she comes to the door, I say,

24:19.458 --> 24:21.039
"congratulations, miss grable.

24:21.168 --> 24:24.456
"We've voted you the girl we'd most
like to be behind barbed wire with.

24:24.588 --> 24:28.046
- "And I'm here to present the award."
- What's the award?

24:28.175 --> 24:30.757
What do you think, jerko?
You're the award!

24:30.886 --> 24:35.346
Me? Supposing she don't want me?

24:35.474 --> 24:38.557
Well, if she don't want you,
she don't get nothing.

24:38.686 --> 24:40.847
You're teasing me again, Harry!

24:40.980 --> 24:43.346
Let go, animal!
It's chow! We'll miss chow!

24:43.482 --> 24:44.892
Chow!

24:50.114 --> 24:51.979
Are you supposed
to drink this stuff or shave?

24:52.116 --> 24:54.072
- Drink.
- Shave.

24:54.201 --> 24:57.364
- Anyone else want potato soup?
- Nol

24:57.496 --> 24:59.578
- you sure?
- Yes!

25:04.336 --> 25:06.918
Chow, chow, where's my chow?

25:18.767 --> 25:21.258
Do you have to put your socks
in my breakfast?

25:21.395 --> 25:23.351
Tough luck.

25:23.480 --> 25:25.596
I hate this life!

25:29.361 --> 25:32.819
- Set her up, cookie. I'm starved.
- I'm all r-r-ready.

26:07.149 --> 26:09.606
Easy, animal. Easy.

26:11.195 --> 26:14.483
- Where did it come from?
- From a chicken, bug-wit.

26:14.615 --> 26:15.821
A chicken?

26:15.949 --> 26:19.487
A chicken lays those things.
Don't you remember, animal?

26:21.038 --> 26:23.654
Hey, it's beautiful.

26:25.542 --> 26:27.533
Are you going to eat it
all by yourself?

26:27.669 --> 26:29.910
Mm-hm. The yellow and the white.

26:32.883 --> 26:37.673
- Is it all right if we smell it?
- Just don't drool on it.

26:37.805 --> 26:41.423
- You're not going to eat the shells?
- Help yourself.

26:47.564 --> 26:48.679
Thanks.

26:50.234 --> 26:52.395
What are we gonna do with it?

26:53.237 --> 26:57.276
We're gonna plant it, animal,
and grow a chicken for Christmas.

27:04.248 --> 27:08.537
If I were you, I'd eat that egg
someplace else. Like under the barracks.

27:08.669 --> 27:10.409
The coffee looks weak today.

27:10.546 --> 27:14.755
Come on, trader horn, what did
you give the krauts for that egg?

27:14.883 --> 27:16.965
45 cigarettes.
The price has gone up.

27:17.094 --> 27:19.551
The cigarettes you took us for
last night?

27:19.680 --> 27:21.887
What would I do with them?
I only smoke cigars.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.425
Nice guy.

27:23.559 --> 27:25.641
The krauts shot manfredi and jonson
last night,

27:25.769 --> 27:27.725
and today he's trading with them.

27:27.855 --> 27:30.688
This may be my last hot breakfast
before they take that stove,

27:30.816 --> 27:32.556
so let me eat in peace?

27:32.693 --> 27:36.652
Ain't that too bad? Tomorrow,
he'll have to suck a raw egg.

27:36.780 --> 27:41.114
He don't have to worry. He can trade
the krauts for a six-burner gas range.

27:41.243 --> 27:42.983
Maybe a deep freeze, too.

27:43.120 --> 27:46.032
What's the beef?
Everybody here's trading.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.952
Maybe I trade a little sharper.
Does that make me a collaborator?

27:49.084 --> 27:52.747
A lot sharper. I'd like some of that loot
you got in the footlockers.

27:52.880 --> 27:57.749
Oh, would you? My first week here,
somebody stole my red cross package,

27:57.885 --> 27:59.421
my blanket and my left shoe.

27:59.553 --> 28:04.217
Since then, I've wised up. This ain't
no salvation army, this is dog-eat-dog.

28:04.349 --> 28:07.716
- You stink, sefton...
- Come off it!

28:11.648 --> 28:15.061
Now you've done it.
You've given me nervous indigestion.

28:16.445 --> 28:17.855
Here, Joey.

28:22.117 --> 28:25.735
- Anything else bothering you, boys?
- Yeah, one little thing.

28:25.871 --> 28:29.204
How were you so sure manfredi and
jonson wouldn't get out of the forest?

28:29.333 --> 28:32.666
I wasn't so sure. I just liked the odds.

28:34.630 --> 28:36.666
What's that crack supposed to mean?

28:36.798 --> 28:39.665
They're lying dead in the mud
and I wanna know how come.

28:39.801 --> 28:44.591
Because you said it would be safe,
and you gave them the green light.

28:44.723 --> 28:48.056
That's how come.
What are you trying to prove?

28:48.185 --> 28:50.545
- Cutting trap doors, digging tunnels...
- Listen, sefton...

28:50.604 --> 28:55.064
You listen to me! What do you think
the chances are of getting out of here?

28:55.192 --> 28:59.652
Let's say you make it to Switzerland.
Or say to the states. So what?

28:59.780 --> 29:02.692
They ship you out to the pacific
and you get shot down again.

29:02.824 --> 29:05.531
Only this time you wind up
in a Japanese prison camp!

29:05.661 --> 29:07.492
That is, if you're lucky.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.700
Well, I'm no escape artist.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.663
Cigar, cookie.

29:12.793 --> 29:16.081
You can be the heroes,
the guys with fruit salad on your chest.

29:16.213 --> 29:18.204
Me, I'm staying put.

29:18.340 --> 29:21.377
I'm gonna make myself
as comfortable as I can.

29:21.510 --> 29:26.129
If I have to trade with the enemy
to get some food or a better mattress,

29:26.265 --> 29:28.176
that's ok by sefton.

29:29.393 --> 29:32.601
Why, you crud!
This war's gonna be over some day.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.971
Then what do you think we'll do
to kraut-kissers like you?

29:36.108 --> 29:40.442
- That's enough!
- At ease, at ease!

29:40.570 --> 29:43.232
Break it off down there.
At ease for the news.

29:43.365 --> 29:46.482
All right, at ease!
Today's camp news.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.451
Father Murray announces that,
due to local regulations,

29:49.579 --> 29:52.696
the Christmas midnight mass
will be at 7:00 in the morning.

29:52.833 --> 29:56.826
He also says, quote: "You sack rats
better show up for services

29:56.962 --> 29:59.328
"and no bull from anybody."
Unquote.

30:00.882 --> 30:03.123
- At ease.
- At easel

30:04.428 --> 30:09.468
next. Monday afternoon, a sailboat race
will be held at the cesspool.

30:09.599 --> 30:12.591
See Oscar Rudolph of barracks 7
if you wish to enter a yacht.

30:14.062 --> 30:17.225
- All right, at ease!
- At ease!

30:17.357 --> 30:18.472
Next.

30:18.608 --> 30:22.772
Jack cushingham and Larry Blake will
play frank de notta and Mike Cohen

30:22.904 --> 30:24.895
for the pinochle championship
of the camp.

30:25.032 --> 30:26.363
That's a fix.

30:26.491 --> 30:29.153
- All right, at ease!
- At easel

30:31.705 --> 30:34.663
next. Tuesday afternoon
at two o'clock,

30:34.791 --> 30:37.828
all men from Texas will meet
behind the north latrine.

30:39.463 --> 30:42.045
- All right, at ease!
- At ease!

30:43.008 --> 30:45.294
Next. A warning
from the kommandant.

30:46.928 --> 30:51.467
Anybody throwing rocks at German
aircraft will be thrown in the boob.

30:51.600 --> 30:52.931
Boo!

30:53.060 --> 30:54.846
All right, at ease!

30:54.978 --> 30:57.720
- Are the doors covered?
- Yeah, the doors are covered.

30:57.856 --> 31:00.222
Ok, Steve, give them the radio.

31:13.747 --> 31:17.160
- You can keep it for two days.
- We're supposed to have it for a week.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.748
You're lucky to get it at all.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.994
The boys are afraid the jerries
will find it. This barracks is jinxed.

31:22.130 --> 31:23.540
We'll take care of it.

31:23.673 --> 31:26.836
Get the antenna going.
Let's see if we can catch the BBC.

31:26.968 --> 31:31.928
Get the antenna, get the antenna,
get the antenna...

31:32.057 --> 31:36.016
- Got the antenna!
- I got the ball. I got the ball.

31:56.164 --> 31:59.622
- Getting anything?
- Too much. I'm trying to unscramble.

31:59.751 --> 32:02.333
If you can't get BBC,
how about guy lombardo?

32:02.462 --> 32:05.249
- Are we boring you, sefton?
- Hold it, quiet!

32:06.675 --> 32:10.543
Five panzer divisions
and nine infantry divisions

32:10.679 --> 32:15.514
of Von rundstedt's army
are pouring into the wide breach.

32:15.642 --> 32:17.883
The krauts have busted through.

32:18.019 --> 32:23.104
A second German wedge is reported
14 miles west of malmedy...

32:24.526 --> 32:28.519
Where tank columns
cut the road to bastogne.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.197
Wunderbar! Isn't he wunderbar?

33:28.423 --> 33:30.835
Has driven across Luxembourg.

33:30.967 --> 33:35.051
The allied air force is grounded
by poor visibility.

33:35.180 --> 33:39.344
Meanwhile,
two of patton's tank units

33:39.476 --> 33:43.060
have been diverted toward bastogne
and are trying to...

33:44.105 --> 33:45.766
- Come on! Come on!
- Static.

33:45.899 --> 33:49.107
Static is right. The radio's static,
patton's static and we're static!

33:49.236 --> 33:51.818
It's gonna be a longer war
than you figured, Duke?

33:51.947 --> 33:53.653
Easy, easy.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.443
Watch it! Watch it!

34:31.777 --> 34:35.565
Well, well, gentlemen,
am I interrupting something?

34:35.699 --> 34:38.235
Yeah, schulz,
we were just passing out guns.

34:38.368 --> 34:39.527
Guns?

34:39.661 --> 34:43.074
Ah, you're joking!
Always with the visecrackers.

34:43.206 --> 34:47.074
Visecrackers? Where did he pick up
his english, in a pretzel factory?

34:47.210 --> 34:48.871
You think I'm a square.

34:49.004 --> 34:51.460
I've been to America.
I've been wrestling there.

34:51.590 --> 34:56.550
I wrestled in Milwaukee, St. Louis,
Cincinnati, and I will go back.

34:56.678 --> 34:59.715
The way the war is going,
I will be there before you.

34:59.848 --> 35:01.930
You should live so long.

35:02.809 --> 35:05.050
Here. That's me in Cincinnati.

35:05.186 --> 35:07.302
Who's the wrestler
with the moustache?

35:07.439 --> 35:09.020
That's my wife.

35:09.149 --> 35:12.357
Hey, look at all that meat.
Ain't she the bitter end?

35:12.485 --> 35:15.693
Give it back.
You must not arouse yourselves.

35:15.822 --> 35:19.861
Hey, schulz, I got a deal for you.
Suppose you help us escape.

35:19.993 --> 35:23.451
We'll have everything waiting for you
in Madison square garden.

35:23.580 --> 35:26.367
For the heavyweight wrestling
championship of the world.

35:26.499 --> 35:29.741
In this corner,
schulz, the beast of Bavaria,

35:29.878 --> 35:33.496
versus the hunchback of stalag 17!

35:35.133 --> 35:36.748
Droppen sie dead!

35:39.387 --> 35:41.594
And now, gentlemen,

35:41.723 --> 35:45.511
we will all go outside
for a little gymnastics.

35:45.644 --> 35:49.933
We will grab some shovels
and undig that tunnel you digged.

35:50.065 --> 35:52.556
Schulz, why don't we just
plug up the tunnel

35:52.692 --> 35:56.150
with the kommandant on one end
and you on the other?

35:56.279 --> 35:58.486
It isn't me, it's the orders.

35:58.615 --> 36:02.199
I'm your friend.
I'm your best friend here.

36:02.327 --> 36:05.069
Cut the guff, schulz, we're on to you.

36:05.205 --> 36:08.697
You know everything that's happening.
Who's tipping you off?

36:08.833 --> 36:11.620
Tipping me off?
I do not understand.

36:11.753 --> 36:15.712
You're wasting your time, Duke.
Come on. Let's get it over with.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.456
Just a second. Schulz says
he's our best friend here.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.299
Maybe he can give us a hint.

36:20.428 --> 36:23.340
Come on, schulz, spill it.
How did you get the information?

36:23.473 --> 36:26.636
About manfredi and jonson?
About the stove and the tunnel?

36:28.186 --> 36:30.427
Which one of us is it?

36:30.563 --> 36:32.599
- Which one of you is what?
- The informer?

36:32.732 --> 36:35.599
Are you saying one American
would inform on another?

36:35.735 --> 36:39.319
That's the general idea. But not
so general as far as I'm concerned.

36:39.447 --> 36:41.312
You're talking crazy!

36:41.449 --> 36:46.785
It's no use. Just tell them it's me,
because I'm the illegitimate son of Hitler,

36:46.913 --> 36:51.577
and after the Germans win the war,
you'll make me the gauleiter of Cincinnati!

36:51.710 --> 36:55.043
You Americans!
You are the craziest people.

36:55.171 --> 36:56.786
That's why I like you.

36:56.923 --> 37:02.543
I wish I could invite you all to my house
for a nice German Christmas.

37:02.679 --> 37:04.089
- Raus/!
- Raus, raus/!

37:04.222 --> 37:05.712
- Raus!
- Down, boy!

37:05.849 --> 37:07.931
Down, boy, down, boy!

38:11.372 --> 38:14.614
"Those poor suckers,
manfredi and jonson.

38:14.751 --> 38:17.584
"They got out of stalag 17 all right,

38:17.712 --> 38:20.374
'only not quite the way
they wanted to go.

38:20.507 --> 38:24.796
'Somebody in our outfit was tipping
off the krauts. Only who was it?

38:24.928 --> 38:32.050
"The animal, or Harry, or hoffy,
or price, or blondie or Joey, or Duke?

38:32.185 --> 38:34.972
'It sure wasn't me.
Maybe it was sefton.

38:36.272 --> 38:39.014
'Sergeant j.J. Sefton.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.893
'It's about time I told you a few
more things about that sefton guy.

38:43.029 --> 38:45.987
'If I was a writer,
I'd send it to the "reader's digest"

38:46.115 --> 38:49.949
'for one of those "most unforgettable
characters you've ever met".

38:50.078 --> 38:54.037
'He was a big-time operator,
always hustling, always scrounging.

38:54.165 --> 38:56.156
"Take, for instance, the horse races.

38:56.292 --> 38:58.999
'Every Saturday and Sunday,
he'd put on horse races.

38:59.128 --> 39:02.871
'He was the sole owner and operator
of the stalag 17 turf club.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.919
'He was the presiding steward,
the chief handicapper,

39:06.052 --> 39:09.044
'the starter, the judge,
the breeder and his own bookie.

39:09.180 --> 39:14.015
'He was the whole works, except I was
the stable boy for five smokes a day.'

39:14.143 --> 39:16.759
give me equipoise.
Ten on the nose.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.225
Ten on the nose.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.690
- Come on, come on.
- Ten on schnickelfritz.

39:26.823 --> 39:29.030
- Equipoise.
- Schnickelfritz.

39:29.158 --> 39:32.321
- Equipoise.
- Come on, the horses are at the post.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.660
- Equipoise?
- Equipoise.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.620
Ten on equipoise.

39:38.751 --> 39:41.063
Five on sea biscuit. I'll pay when
the red cross parcels come in.

39:41.087 --> 39:43.043
- No credit.
- Have a heart, sefton.

39:43.172 --> 39:45.458
Sorry, it's against the rules
of the racing commission.

39:45.592 --> 39:48.504
Any more bets? Ready, cookie?

39:49.929 --> 39:52.090
- Ready!
- Let them go!

39:52.223 --> 39:54.805
And they are off and running
at stalag 17!

40:00.523 --> 40:03.515
Come on, equipoise.
Come on, you beauty!

40:05.820 --> 40:07.776
Equipoise! What did I tell you?

40:07.906 --> 40:10.318
Don't be no rat!
Daddy'll buy you a piece of cheese!

40:10.450 --> 40:11.485
Let's go!

40:13.745 --> 40:17.329
- This way, this way!
- Straighten out, you dog!

40:21.169 --> 40:23.285
That's no horse, that's a dervish!

40:23.421 --> 40:26.504
Please, please, for daddy!
For daddy!

40:31.763 --> 40:35.221
The winner is number five,
schnickelfritz.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.556
Schnickelfritz...

40:37.685 --> 40:42.099
I told you schnickelfritz!
You made me bet on equipoise!

40:42.231 --> 40:45.143
I clocked him this morning.
He was running like a doll.

40:45.276 --> 40:48.484
You clocked him?
Why don't I clock you?

40:50.573 --> 40:53.531
'Another one of his enterprises
was the distillery.

40:53.660 --> 40:58.324
'He ran a bar right in our barracks,
selling schnapps at two cigarettes a shot.

40:58.456 --> 41:01.823
'The boys called it the flamethrower,
but it wasn't really that bad.

41:01.960 --> 41:04.451
'We brewed it
out of old potato peels

41:04.587 --> 41:07.875
'and once in a while a couple
of strings off the red cross parcels,

41:08.007 --> 41:09.998
'just to give it a little flavour.'

41:11.970 --> 41:18.808
it ain't fair, Harry.
I'm telling you, it ain't fair. My Betty!

41:18.935 --> 41:23.349
Ain't she beautiful?
She married an orchestra leader!

41:23.481 --> 41:25.847
So what? There's other women.

41:26.734 --> 41:30.602
Not for me. Betty!

41:32.448 --> 41:35.064
- Betty!
- Forget Betty, animal.

41:35.201 --> 41:38.159
I'll get you a date with some
of those Russian women.

41:38.287 --> 41:40.448
You'll get me a date?

41:40.581 --> 41:45.166
Sure, I'll get you
into the Russian compound.

41:45.294 --> 41:50.084
How? Pinky Miller from barracks 8
tried to get in over there,

41:50.216 --> 41:52.127
and they shot him in the leg.

41:52.260 --> 41:57.095
It takes a gimmick, animal.
I figured us a little gimmick.

41:57.223 --> 41:58.554
You did?

41:58.683 --> 42:02.676
Sharp. Sometimes I'm so sharp,
it's frightening.

42:05.648 --> 42:08.390
To the brick kremlin.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.689
- She'll never forgive me.
- Come on, animal.

42:19.328 --> 42:22.912
What are you serving today,
nitric acid?

42:23.041 --> 42:25.202
I only work here.
Talk to the management.

42:25.334 --> 42:26.744
All right.

42:28.671 --> 42:32.710
Mr management?
What are you trying to do?

42:32.842 --> 42:35.049
Embalm us
while we're still alive?

42:35.178 --> 42:38.261
What do you expect?
Eight-year-old bottled-in-bond?

42:38.389 --> 42:40.971
All the house guarantees
is you don't go blind.

42:41.100 --> 42:43.011
Blind? Harry!

42:44.270 --> 42:46.761
Harry, Harry, I'm blind, Harry!

42:46.898 --> 42:50.937
Harry, where are you?
I can't see. I'm blind, Harry.

42:51.069 --> 42:54.812
- Harry? Harry? I'm blind.
- Blind?

42:55.823 --> 42:58.610
How stupid can you get, animal?

43:08.461 --> 43:11.123
'The killer-diller,
of course, the real bonanza

43:11.255 --> 43:13.792
'was when sefton put up
the observatory.

43:13.925 --> 43:18.043
'He scrounged some high-powered
kraut lenses and a magnifying mirror,

43:18.179 --> 43:21.387
'and got Ronnie bigelow
from barracks 2 to put it together

43:21.516 --> 43:23.006
'for a pound of coffee.

43:23.142 --> 43:25.929
'On a clear day,
you could see the Swiss alps.

43:26.062 --> 43:28.178
'Only who wanted to see
the Swiss alps?

43:28.314 --> 43:31.647
'It was about a mile away
from that Russian delousing shack,

43:31.776 --> 43:33.983
'but we were right on top of it.

43:34.112 --> 43:37.445
'It cost a cigarette
or half a bar of chocolate a peek.

43:37.573 --> 43:39.734
'You couldn't catch much
through that steam,

43:39.867 --> 43:42.153
'but after two years in that camp,

43:42.286 --> 43:46.950
'just the idea of what was behind that
window sure spruced up your voltage.'

43:49.001 --> 43:51.959
let's go.
20 seconds to a customer.

44:02.223 --> 44:04.555
Hey, sefton,
what's snarling up the traffic?

44:04.684 --> 44:07.221
By the time we get to look,
they'll be old hags.

44:07.353 --> 44:08.684
Simmer down, boys.

44:08.813 --> 44:12.180
There'll be a second show
when they put the next batch through.

44:23.202 --> 44:28.287
Hey, sefton. What's the big idea?
Take that telescope out of here.

44:28.416 --> 44:29.826
- Says who?
- Me.

44:29.959 --> 44:32.666
You take it out,
but there'll be a riot.

44:32.795 --> 44:36.333
Every time they get red cross packages,
you find some angle to Rob them.

44:36.465 --> 44:39.172
When they find out,
they'll throw us in the boob.

44:39.302 --> 44:41.088
They know.
I'd worry about the radio.

44:41.220 --> 44:43.540
Maybe they also know about
your distillery and horse races.

44:43.639 --> 44:44.754
That's right.

44:44.891 --> 44:46.973
What makes you and them krauts
so buddy-buddy?

44:47.101 --> 44:48.591
Ask security.

44:48.728 --> 44:51.640
Tell him. You got me shadowed
every minute of the day.

44:51.772 --> 44:53.637
- Haven't you found out yet?
- Not yet.

44:53.774 --> 44:57.858
- How do you get all these privileges?
- I give the guards ten per cent.

44:57.987 --> 45:00.649
- And maybe something else!
- A little something what?

45:00.781 --> 45:03.272
- A little information.
- Break it off!

45:03.409 --> 45:05.365
How much more do we
have to take from this crud?

45:05.494 --> 45:08.611
There'll be no vigilante stuff
while I'm barracks chief.

45:08.748 --> 45:14.869
Hey, look at 'em! Those crazy jerks!
The krauts'll shoot them!

45:15.004 --> 45:19.122
Harry and the animal are trying
to sneak into the Russian compound!

45:40.821 --> 45:42.186
They're past the 50-yard line!

45:42.323 --> 45:45.486
- It's a quarterback sneak!
- Look at 'em go!

45:59.882 --> 46:02.544
Those idiots will paint themselves
right into their graves.

46:16.107 --> 46:18.974
J get a load of them! J

46:19.110 --> 46:21.897
hello, bublichki. How are y'all?

46:22.029 --> 46:26.489
J hi-ya, howdee, howdee do j

46:34.583 --> 46:38.792
Hey, the brick kremlin!
Hey, Olga volga, wait for me!

46:38.921 --> 46:42.709
Hey, animal... the window.

47:19.378 --> 47:20.834
Schweinehund!

47:37.563 --> 47:42.557
'So life sort of drifted
back to normal in stalag 17.

47:42.693 --> 47:46.857
'It was a couple of days before Christmas
and everything seemed quiet enough.

47:46.989 --> 47:51.153
'But underneath it, we knew we were
sitting on a barrel of dynamite,

47:51.285 --> 47:55.654
'and that the stoolie, whoever he was,
was ready to strike again any second.'

47:55.790 --> 47:59.374
at ease! At ease! At ease!

47:59.502 --> 48:03.336
All right, at ease, at ease!
Mail call!

48:05.841 --> 48:08.708
- All right, at ease.
- Hey, man...

48:08.844 --> 48:11.130
Anything for Stanislaus kuzawa?

48:11.263 --> 48:15.632
First. The kommandant is sending
every barracks a little Christmas present.

48:15.768 --> 48:17.759
A copy of "mein kampf".

48:17.895 --> 48:20.853
- All right, at ease.
- At easel

48:20.981 --> 48:25.065
in oberst Von scherbach's words,
"now that German victory is in sight,

48:25.194 --> 48:27.526
"all American prisoners
are to be indoctrinated

48:27.655 --> 48:29.816
"with the teachings of the fiihrer."
Unquote.

48:29.949 --> 48:31.689
In my own words...

48:31.826 --> 48:33.362
Unquote.

48:34.829 --> 48:36.820
That's the wrong direction.

48:43.546 --> 48:45.002
- Martin.
- Here.

48:45.131 --> 48:46.837
- Shapiro.
- Yup.

48:46.966 --> 48:48.206
- Price.
- Yeah.

48:48.342 --> 48:50.003
- Trzcinski.
- Yo.

48:50.136 --> 48:51.467
- McKay.
- Yo!

48:51.595 --> 48:54.177
Shapiro. Shapiro.

48:54.306 --> 48:55.716
Manfredi...

49:00.354 --> 49:01.685
Shapiro.

49:01.814 --> 49:03.600
- Musgrove.
- Hey!

49:03.732 --> 49:05.142
- McKay.
- Yo!

49:05.276 --> 49:06.641
- Peterson.
- Yeah!

49:06.777 --> 49:08.313
- Plews.
- Here.

49:08.446 --> 49:09.731
- Pirelli.
- Hey!

49:09.864 --> 49:11.320
- Coleman.
- Yol!

49:11.449 --> 49:15.112
- Shapiro.
- Nothing for Stanislaus kuzawa?

49:15.244 --> 49:18.077
Shapiro. Shapiro.

49:19.081 --> 49:20.912
- Agnew.
- Here.

49:21.041 --> 49:24.659
And just what makes you
so popular?

49:24.795 --> 49:28.128
It's amazing. 50 million guys
running around back home,

49:28.257 --> 49:31.624
and all those dames want
is sugar-lips shapiro.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.920
- Plews.
- Here.

49:33.053 --> 49:34.418
- Bauer.
- Here.

49:34.555 --> 49:35.965
- McKay.
- Yo!

49:36.098 --> 49:37.338
- Agnew.
- Here.

49:37.475 --> 49:39.056
- Here, kuzawa.
- Yeah?

49:39.185 --> 49:42.302
- Give this to Joey?
- Is that all the mail?

49:42.438 --> 49:44.053
At ease, at ease!

49:44.190 --> 49:47.978
Here's a little something from
father Murray. One to each barrack.

49:50.863 --> 49:54.276
And he wants you to cut out
all swearing during yuletide.

49:54.408 --> 49:56.649
- How did he get those trees?
- Prayed, I guess.

49:56.785 --> 49:59.492
They grew out of his mattress.
Come on, Steve.

50:00.372 --> 50:03.705
Hey! What do we do
for decorations?

50:03.834 --> 50:06.291
For that, you gotta pray yourself.

50:08.422 --> 50:14.463
"And so, Joey, we do hope that you
will finish that last year of law school

50:14.595 --> 50:16.961
"when you come back home."

50:18.766 --> 50:20.381
Law school?

50:20.518 --> 50:23.476
Hey, you don't wanna be
no stinking lawyer

50:23.604 --> 50:27.597
with a stinking briefcase
and a stinking office, do you, Joey?

50:27.733 --> 50:29.018
Nah!

50:29.151 --> 50:33.520
"And do keep writing, son.
Your letters are very dear to us.

50:33.656 --> 50:36.238
"With all our love, dad."

50:38.244 --> 50:41.702
It's from your dad, Joey.
Here, take it.

50:42.373 --> 50:46.366
Next time we write to your folks,
you know what you're gonna say?

50:46.502 --> 50:49.994
You're gonna say that
you don't wanna be no lawyer,

50:50.130 --> 50:53.247
that you wanna be a musician, maybe.

50:53.384 --> 50:56.626
Like play the flute. Yeah, Joey?

51:06.397 --> 51:11.482
"I saw a wonderful article on German
prison camps in a magazine."

51:11.610 --> 51:13.225
Mom reads a lot.

51:13.362 --> 51:17.731
"They showed pictures of the tennis
courts, and also say that in winter

51:17.866 --> 51:20.733
"they freeze them over
so you boys can ice skate."

51:20.869 --> 51:23.906
Anything about us grouse hunting
in the Vienna woods?

51:24.039 --> 51:26.872
"In a way, I'm glad you're not
in America right now,

51:27.001 --> 51:29.538
"with everything rationed here,
like gas and meat."

51:29.670 --> 51:31.206
Heart-rendering, ain't it?

51:31.338 --> 51:34.375
Why don't we send them
some food parcels?

51:38.095 --> 51:41.758
- What do all those broads say?
- What do they always say?

51:41.890 --> 51:45.053
- Let me read one.
- It's not good for you, animal.

51:46.604 --> 51:51.894
Hey, this is with a typewriter.
It's from a finance company.

51:52.026 --> 51:56.235
So it is from the finance company.
It's better than no letter at all.

51:56.363 --> 51:59.321
So they want the third payment
on the Plymouth.

51:59.450 --> 52:04.114
So they want the fourth,
the fifth, the sixth, the seventh.

52:04.246 --> 52:05.736
So they want the Plymouth.

52:05.873 --> 52:10.116
Sugar-lips shapiro.
Amazing, ain't it?

52:11.170 --> 52:13.411
- I believe it.
- You believe what?

52:13.547 --> 52:16.539
My wife. She says,
"darling, you won't believe it,

52:16.675 --> 52:19.633
"but I found an adorable baby
on our doorstep,

52:19.762 --> 52:22.128
"and I've decided to keep it
for our very own.

52:22.264 --> 52:25.677
"You won't believe it, but it's got
exactly my eyes and nose."

52:25.809 --> 52:29.176
Why does she keep saying
I don't believe it? I believe it.

52:30.939 --> 52:32.475
I believe it.

52:33.734 --> 52:35.770
I believe it.

52:41.742 --> 52:45.109
This is it, gentlemen.
Don't bother to scrape your shoes.

52:47.998 --> 52:50.410
Ok, gang! Meet our new guests.

52:50.542 --> 52:53.329
This is lieutenant dunbar
and this is sergeant bagradian.

52:53.462 --> 52:55.123
A lieutenant?

52:56.382 --> 52:58.873
Knock it off, fellas.
The pleasure's all mine.

52:59.009 --> 53:01.466
- How are things?
- What's doing on the outside?

53:01.595 --> 53:04.007
- What's new in the states?
- Let's hear it!

53:04.139 --> 53:07.472
The skirts are shorter,
if that's what you mean.

53:08.102 --> 53:11.139
At ease! The lieutenant
will be with us for a week

53:11.271 --> 53:13.728
until the krauts ship him
to the officers' camp in silesia.

53:13.857 --> 53:16.018
All railroads out of Frankfurt
are fouled up,

53:16.151 --> 53:17.911
because somebody blew up
an ammunition train.

53:17.986 --> 53:22.855
Somebody, my eye! The lieutenant did it,
with 50 German guards around.

53:22.991 --> 53:24.697
Glad to have you with the organisation.

53:24.827 --> 53:27.409
You're in time
for the Christmas pageant.

53:27.538 --> 53:30.154
Looks more like
the lost company of tobacco road.

53:30.290 --> 53:33.657
He's an actor. You should see
his imitations. He can do anybody.

53:33.794 --> 53:35.955
- Do Lionel Barrymore again.
- Do Alan ladd.

53:36.088 --> 53:38.921
- Do Cary Grant.
- Hey, do grable!

53:40.592 --> 53:42.503
Now see here, Scarlet,

53:42.636 --> 53:45.218
I'm crazy about you
and always have been.

53:45.347 --> 53:46.962
I gave you kisses for breakfast,

53:47.099 --> 53:49.465
kisses for lunch
and kisses for supper.

53:49.601 --> 53:52.263
And now I find
that you're eating out.

53:52.396 --> 53:55.604
- Not gable, grable!
- That's enough.

53:55.733 --> 53:58.941
They were shot down two days ago and
they've been on their feet ever since.

53:59.069 --> 54:01.526
Price'll show you to your bunks.

54:03.031 --> 54:05.272
Fix them some tea, huh?

54:05.409 --> 54:07.525
We had a couple
of unexpected vacancies.

54:07.661 --> 54:09.401
Upper or lower, lieutenant?

54:09.538 --> 54:12.154
It doesn't matter.
Just so I can get some sleep.

54:12.291 --> 54:13.906
- Lieutenant dunbar?
- Yeah?

54:14.042 --> 54:16.374
James schuyler dunbar
from Boston?

54:16.503 --> 54:18.539
Yes. Do we know each other?

54:18.672 --> 54:21.709
He's from Boston, too,
but you wouldn't know him,

54:21.842 --> 54:24.379
unless you had your house robbed.

54:24.511 --> 54:27.799
Maybe he would. We were gonna
be officers together, remember?

54:27.931 --> 54:31.048
Only they washed me out.
I'm glad to see you made it.

54:31.185 --> 54:34.052
Of course all your dough
had nothing to do with it.

54:34.188 --> 54:37.351
- His mother's got $20 million.
- 25.

54:37.483 --> 54:40.475
They've got a summer home
in nantucket with a Polo field.

54:40.611 --> 54:43.068
- Put a canopy over his bunk.
- Lay off, sefton!

54:43.197 --> 54:46.405
With all your mother's pull, how come
you're not a chicken colonel by now?

54:46.533 --> 54:48.740
Lay off, unless you want
your head handed to you!

54:48.869 --> 54:52.202
Tea is being served on the veranda.

54:52.331 --> 54:54.822
Animal, where are the napkins?

55:04.676 --> 55:06.962
Do be seated, bonita.

55:07.095 --> 55:09.757
What a perfectly
charming table arrangement.

55:09.890 --> 55:13.053
They must've copied it
from "house beautiful".

55:13.185 --> 55:16.018
Animal, how many times
have I told you?

55:16.146 --> 55:18.762
You always gotta pour from the left.

55:36.708 --> 55:38.994
Thank you, James.

55:39.127 --> 55:42.585
Don't encourage them.
Those are the barrack's clowns.

55:43.674 --> 55:47.462
- Did they get you over Frankfurt?
- On the schweinfurt run.

55:47.594 --> 55:49.801
- Flak or fighters?
- Fighters.

55:49.930 --> 55:53.138
- How many ships did you lose?
- About half the group.

55:53.267 --> 55:56.555
- Flying out of england?
- Yes, waddington. 92nd bomber group.

55:56.687 --> 56:00.145
Lieutenant, how did you blow up
that train with 50 guards around?

56:00.274 --> 56:03.266
Well, I was just lucky, I guess.

56:03.402 --> 56:06.986
Don't let him kid you. Cagney couldn't
have pulled a sweeter job.

56:07.114 --> 56:09.150
Here's what happened.

56:09.283 --> 56:12.150
We were waiting in the depot
in Frankfurt, understand?

56:12.286 --> 56:14.242
When an ammunition train
comes through,

56:14.371 --> 56:17.033
the longest ammunition train
you ever saw, understand?

56:17.165 --> 56:20.532
He's just giving it a big build-up.
It was simple enough.

56:20.669 --> 56:24.332
I went into the men's room,
fixed a little time bomb,

56:24.464 --> 56:27.297
broke open the window
and when the train pulled out

56:27.426 --> 56:29.382
I tossed it into an open car.

56:29.511 --> 56:31.843
There must've been straw
on the floor.

56:31.972 --> 56:36.466
Yeah. And about three minutes later
you can hear it... boom!

56:36.602 --> 56:39.389
Understand?
Broke every window in Frankfurt.

56:39.521 --> 56:42.103
Understand? It was gorgeous.

56:42.232 --> 56:48.273
Wait a second.
I'm not through. Understand?

56:48.405 --> 56:52.068
- I wouldn't talk about things like that.
- They never caught on.

56:52.200 --> 56:54.407
They may.
That's why I'd keep my mouth shut.

56:54.536 --> 56:56.743
Why? We're all Americans here,
aren't we?

56:56.872 --> 57:00.490
- The krauts are getting information.
- Yeah, especially in this barracks.

57:00.626 --> 57:03.413
- How?
- That's what we'd like to know.

57:03.545 --> 57:06.833
- There's only one pair left.
- We'll get some more.

57:06.965 --> 57:10.128
Where does a fella
take a hot shower around here?

57:10.260 --> 57:12.216
Hot shower? Dig him!

57:12.346 --> 57:14.587
No hot showers.
You wash in the latrine.

57:14.723 --> 57:17.590
- In a latrine?
- What do you expect, glamour boy?

57:17.726 --> 57:20.684
An officers' club
with a steam room and a massage?

57:20.812 --> 57:23.849
Just a minute. You made some
cracks before and I let them slide,

57:23.982 --> 57:26.189
but I don't intend to take any more.

57:26.318 --> 57:30.402
If you resent my having money,
start a revolution, but get off my back.

57:30.530 --> 57:33.488
Look, your dough won't help.
Here you're on your own.

57:33.617 --> 57:36.950
No mother to throw you a lifebelt.
Let's see how good you swim.

57:37.079 --> 57:42.699
I can swim all right. We own three
swimming pools and a private lake.

57:42.834 --> 57:44.370
That figures.

57:44.503 --> 57:47.040
Sorry, boys, my taxi's waiting.

57:57.933 --> 58:01.425
Cut the horseplay, Harry.
What's the matter with you guys?

58:04.314 --> 58:06.726
Get ready, here he comes!

58:16.201 --> 58:19.534
Czechoslovakia and Poland - kaputt!

58:19.663 --> 58:24.157
And the fraulein
with the glockenspiel - verboten.

58:24.292 --> 58:27.955
And the apple strudel
with the /liederkranz - gesundheit!

58:28.088 --> 58:32.206
Everything is gesundheit,
kaputt and verboten!'

58:32.342 --> 58:34.424
gentlemen! Attention!

58:34.553 --> 58:37.044
- Heil Hitler!
- Heil hi...

58:37.180 --> 58:38.545
Droppen sie dead!

58:38.682 --> 58:40.798
Quiet! We are indoctrinating.

58:40.934 --> 58:43.676
- Is all you indoctrinated?
- Ja!

58:43.812 --> 58:46.269
- Is you all good little Nazis?
- Jawobh/!

58:46.398 --> 58:48.764
- Is you all good little adolfs?
- Jawobh/!

58:48.900 --> 58:51.733
Then we will all salute
feldwebel schulz.

58:51.862 --> 58:53.398
About face!

58:54.448 --> 58:56.234
- Sieg heil!
- Sieg heil!

58:56.366 --> 58:57.856
Sieg heil!

58:59.828 --> 59:02.615
Ach, one fiihrer is enough.

59:02.748 --> 59:05.410
Now, please, gentlemen,
take off those moustaches.

59:05.542 --> 59:07.908
Or do you want me arrested
by the gestapo?

59:08.045 --> 59:09.330
Jawohl!

59:09.463 --> 59:14.548
You would be very sorry to get a new
feldwebel without a sense of humour.

59:14.676 --> 59:20.091
Ok, gang, take off the moustaches.
Now, what is it, schulz?

59:20.223 --> 59:23.761
Gentlemen, tomorrow morning
the Geneva man will inspect the camp

59:23.894 --> 59:27.227
and find out if we are living up
to the international convention.

59:27.355 --> 59:29.846
I'm sure he'll find
we are treating you very well.

59:29.983 --> 59:32.224
You must not run around
in your underwear.

59:32.360 --> 59:33.850
And take off the wash.

59:33.987 --> 59:37.855
The kommandant wants all the barracks
to be spick and also span.

59:37.991 --> 59:40.778
Yeah, we'll put pink ribbons
on the bedbugs.

59:40.911 --> 59:46.122
The kommandant also sends
every man a new clean blanket.

59:46.249 --> 59:48.615
Yeah, we know.
We had them last year.

59:48.752 --> 59:51.835
Five minutes after he was gone,
the blankets were gone.

59:51.963 --> 59:53.078
Ja.

59:53.215 --> 59:57.458
The kommandant also told me
to pick up the radio.

59:57.594 --> 59:59.425
What radio, schulz?

59:59.554 --> 01:00:02.637
The one you are hiding,
don't you know?

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:06.350
The one your friend mit-out the leg
is smuggling in the compound.

01:00:06.478 --> 01:00:08.719
- You're off your nut.
- Give me the radio.

01:00:08.855 --> 01:00:13.144
- We have no radio.
- All right, gentlemen, I'll find it myself.

01:00:13.276 --> 01:00:17.360
Now, let's see.
Where could it be?

01:00:18.698 --> 01:00:23.818
Maybe, in the lieutenant's bunk?
Oh, no, not in the lieutenant's bunk.

01:00:23.954 --> 01:00:27.572
I'm cold here.
Maybe warmer on this side.

01:00:27.707 --> 01:00:31.541
In the piccolo, may...
Oh, no, not in the piccolo.

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:36.790
Am I getting warmer? Hot, maybe?

01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:40.876
Very hot?

01:00:56.820 --> 01:01:00.529
- What is this? This is water?
- It's a mousetrap.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:03.865
- Ha! And this?
- My grandmother's earmuffs.

01:01:03.994 --> 01:01:07.157
Look at them, lieutenant.
Everybody is a clown.

01:01:07.289 --> 01:01:10.577
How can you win the war
mit an army of clowns?

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:12.870
We hope you'll laugh
yourselves to death.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:14.334
Yeah.

01:01:22.679 --> 01:01:27.093
Now, outside everybody!
Everybody out for the blankets.

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:28.340
Clear out.

01:01:28.476 --> 01:01:32.094
Hey, you too, outside.
Get going! Raus/!

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.562
Hurry up, boys. Raus! Raus/!

01:02:03.428 --> 01:02:07.842
That schulz pig knew
where the radio was all the time.

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:10.260
That stoolie is sure
batting a thousand.

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:14.511
The guy I want to talk to is sefton.
Anybody seen sefton?

01:02:14.648 --> 01:02:17.606
- Cookie, have you seen sefton?
- No, I haven't.

01:02:18.526 --> 01:02:20.892
Here, here!

01:02:25.992 --> 01:02:28.859
Hoffy, I'm sorry
about the mouse trap,

01:02:28.995 --> 01:02:32.613
but the war news are
very depressing anyway.

01:02:36.002 --> 01:02:41.998
I might as well also confiscate
the antenna. American know-how.

01:02:46.388 --> 01:02:49.095
- All right, cookie. Where's sefton?
- I don't know.

01:02:49.224 --> 01:02:52.011
- At the kommandant's?
- L1 don't know.

01:02:52.143 --> 01:02:55.101
- What did they trade him for the radio?
- I don't know.

01:02:55.230 --> 01:02:57.221
Why don't we look
in his footlockers?

01:02:57.357 --> 01:02:59.894
Come on, you little stooge!
Hand over them keys!

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:04.144
- I haven't got any k-k-keys.
- Ok, then I'll get me a key.

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.772
- Ok, hoffy?
- Ok.

01:03:06.908 --> 01:03:10.492
W-w-wait a minute. Don't!
Sefton will get mad.

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:23.714
- Of all the hoarding cruds!
- Looks like Macy's basement, don't it?

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:26.299
That kid's richer than my mother.

01:03:26.428 --> 01:03:28.794
Shut up!

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:34.012
For crying out loud.
What would he be doing with these?

01:03:34.144 --> 01:03:37.762
Suppose you ask me?
Go on, ask me.

01:03:40.734 --> 01:03:45.603
Because I got the goods on mr sefton.
Because this time he didn't shake me.

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:55.987
Take a look for yourself.
It'll curdle your guts.

01:03:57.834 --> 01:03:59.495
The Russian women!

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:02.168
Get away!

01:04:03.506 --> 01:04:06.464
Here, try the end window,
where the candy is.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:08.879
Come on, hoffy, we all want to see!

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:10.877
- How did he get over there?
- Easy.

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:14.472
Through the gate, past the guard
like some kraut field marshal.

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:18.435
Now we know what he got for the radio.

01:04:18.563 --> 01:04:20.679
This is murder!

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:25.024
The stinking miser,
keeping all that for himself!

01:04:26.196 --> 01:04:30.280
So I'm a vigilante? What are
the barrack's officers gonna do now?

01:04:30.408 --> 01:04:32.490
Don't worry, Duke. We'll handle it now.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:36.282
You better handle it fast,
before he sells us all down the river.

01:05:29.551 --> 01:05:30.711
Hi.

01:05:31.678 --> 01:05:33.714
Too late for chow?

01:05:35.432 --> 01:05:37.593
What's the matter, boys,
is my slip showing?

01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:40.717
I'll say it is.
You spilled a little borscht on it.

01:05:40.854 --> 01:05:44.267
- Borscht?
- D'you have a good time over there?

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:47.436
Oh, somebody was peeking.

01:05:47.569 --> 01:05:49.685
Yeah, had a dreamy time.

01:05:49.821 --> 01:05:52.528
Those dames really know
how to throw a party.

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:55.023
I've known some women in my time,

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.197
but there's nothing like
the hot breath of the cossacks.

01:05:58.329 --> 01:06:02.163
There are a couple of blonde snipers
over there, real man-killers, they...

01:06:05.336 --> 01:06:06.746
What's this?

01:06:09.090 --> 01:06:12.628
- What happened, cookie? Who did it?
- We did it.

01:06:14.304 --> 01:06:17.296
Better not be anything missing.
This is private property.

01:06:17.432 --> 01:06:20.845
So was the radio private property.
So were manfredi and jonson.

01:06:24.397 --> 01:06:28.265
- What about the radio?
- Yeah, what about it?

01:06:28.401 --> 01:06:32.815
Cut the horsing around! We know
he's the stoolie and what the pay-off is.

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:35.313
- Let's get on with it!
- With what?

01:06:35.450 --> 01:06:39.739
What is this anyway, a kangaroo court?
Why not get a rope and do it right?

01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:41.862
You make my mouth water.

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:44.831
You're all wire-happy.
You've been here too long.

01:06:44.959 --> 01:06:48.122
You put two and two together
and got four. Only it ain't four!

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:52.839
- What's it add up to you, sefton?
- You got yourselves the wrong guy.

01:06:52.967 --> 01:06:57.051
I'm telling you, the krauts wouldn't
plant two stoolies in one barracks.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:01.173
Whatever you do to me, you'll have
to do again when you find the right guy.

01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:03.391
Watch it, the kommandant!

01:07:20.036 --> 01:07:22.368
Achtung! Herr kommandant!

01:07:27.168 --> 01:07:29.659
Good evening, sergeants.

01:07:31.714 --> 01:07:34.456
A little coffee-klatch
you are having, eh?

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.126
Gloomy in here, isn't it?

01:07:39.847 --> 01:07:43.965
- Where is the barracks chief?
- Yes, sir.

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:49.517
You have a lieutenant here.
Lieutenant, er... James dunbar?

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:52.098
Yes, sir.

01:07:53.236 --> 01:07:55.522
I'm lieutenant dunbar.

01:07:56.781 --> 01:07:59.022
What is your number?

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:06.784
- 105-353.
- That is correct.

01:08:08.126 --> 01:08:11.539
Lieutenant dunbar, I came
to apologise for the accommodations.

01:08:11.671 --> 01:08:16.165
Ordinarily, of course, we never put
officers up with enlisted men.

01:08:16.301 --> 01:08:17.916
I'l live.

01:08:18.051 --> 01:08:21.636
Quite a transportation jam
we're having outside of Frankfurt.

01:08:21.764 --> 01:08:23.880
They are very angry in Berlin.

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:28.761
They will be angrier on the east front,
waiting for that ammunition train.

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:32.764
- Don't you think so, lieutenant?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:37.109
How would you like to join me
in my quarters?

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:39.694
I have a nice fire going.

01:08:39.823 --> 01:08:42.439
- I'm ok here, why bother?
- No bother.

01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:47.321
I'm very grateful for a little company.
You see, I suffer from insomnia.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:49.663
Did you ever try 40 sleeping pills?

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:04.796
We have some rights, colonel.
Why's this man being taken out?

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:09.100
Curtains would do wonders
for this barrack.

01:09:11.272 --> 01:09:13.263
You will not get them.

01:09:23.033 --> 01:09:25.149
How did he find out
about the ammunition train?

01:09:25.286 --> 01:09:27.868
You must've shot your mouths off
from Frankfurt to here.

01:09:27.997 --> 01:09:30.783
- No, we didn't.
- Maybe a hint? Think hard.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:35.832
I don't have to think. We didn't say
a word until we hit this barracks.

01:09:54.273 --> 01:09:56.730
What are you looking at me for?

01:09:56.859 --> 01:10:00.522
Lights out! Lights out!

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:23.333
I suppose some jerk's gonna say
I did it.

01:10:36.065 --> 01:10:38.932
Why don't you try it one at a time?

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:54.997
'There's a lot of folks around
that don't believe in Santa claus.

01:10:55.126 --> 01:10:57.333
'I always did and I always will.

01:10:57.462 --> 01:11:00.329
'For a while, I thought the German
luftwaffe had shot him down,

01:11:00.465 --> 01:11:03.207
'reindeer, sleigh and all.
But no, sir.

01:11:03.342 --> 01:11:04.957
'Come the day before Christmas,

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:08.257
'the Geneva man showed up
with some presents for us.

01:11:08.389 --> 01:11:12.257
'They brought us coffee, a little sugar,
prunes and t-t-toothbrushes,

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:15.510
'and, of all things,
some ping-pong balls.

01:11:15.646 --> 01:11:17.511
"There must've been a slip-up,

01:11:17.648 --> 01:11:21.436
'because suddenly we wound up
with 2,000 ping-pong balls.

01:11:21.569 --> 01:11:23.776
'It seemed pretty idiotic at the time,

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:27.693
'but, as it turned out, those
ping-pong balls sure came in handy.

01:11:27.825 --> 01:11:29.816
'Oh, mother, did they come in handy!'

01:11:55.102 --> 01:11:56.558
Hey, schulz!

01:11:57.605 --> 01:12:00.722
What is this?
You must get out of your bunk.

01:12:00.858 --> 01:12:03.645
The Geneva man is coming
to inspect the...

01:12:03.778 --> 01:12:06.269
Lieber gott!
How do you look? You had a fight?

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:09.613
Would you like to give frau schulz
silk stockings for Christmas?

01:12:09.742 --> 01:12:12.484
You should see the doctor.
Maybe I can...

01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.906
- Silk stockings?
- Take them.

01:12:15.039 --> 01:12:17.121
Wunderbar!

01:12:17.250 --> 01:12:20.367
Maybe they are too wunderbar
for my wife,

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:22.414
but there's a piano teacher
in the village...

01:12:22.547 --> 01:12:26.506
- And 200 cigarettes for yourself?
- 200 cigarettes!

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:28.875
What is it you want from me?

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:31.218
- Who's the guy?
- What guy?

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.963
The one you work with.
How do you do it?

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:36.557
- I don't want the cigarettes.
- I'll make it 400.

01:12:36.686 --> 01:12:38.096
No! No! No!

01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:40.060
Listen, schulz, you better talk,

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.521
because I'm gonna find out
with you or without you.

01:12:42.650 --> 01:12:46.142
I won't let go. They'll have to kill me
to stop me! So talk!

01:12:46.279 --> 01:12:49.146
Talk what?
No, I don't know anything.

01:12:49.282 --> 01:12:51.147
How many do you want? 1,000?

01:12:51.284 --> 01:12:53.070
- No!
- Here, take them!

01:13:04.005 --> 01:13:06.747
Gentlemen, when the Geneva man
comes through the barracks,

01:13:06.883 --> 01:13:09.295
I don't want you to complain to him.

01:13:09.427 --> 01:13:13.796
I have orders from the kommandant
to report everyone who complains.

01:13:18.019 --> 01:13:22.012
Look at him, dunbar's being crucified
and he's trading again.

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:24.730
Didn't you get enough last night?
Still itching for more?

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:26.440
Some guys never learn.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:30.187
- Here's some ice off the roof.
- Beat it, you little stooge!

01:13:30.323 --> 01:13:32.279
Tell the crumb where he stands.

01:13:32.408 --> 01:13:35.115
I called a meeting
of the barracks chiefs this morning.

01:13:35.244 --> 01:13:38.156
I thought I could get you transferred
to another barracks.

01:13:38.289 --> 01:13:42.498
But it turns out that nobody likes you
any more than we do.

01:13:42.627 --> 01:13:45.414
So you're stuck with me, huh?

01:13:45.546 --> 01:13:47.582
Maybe the Russian broads
would take him.

01:13:47.715 --> 01:13:49.706
Not with that kisser, not any more.

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.707
You got off lucky last night, sefton.

01:13:51.844 --> 01:13:54.506
One more move, and you'll wake up
with your throat cut!

01:13:54.639 --> 01:13:57.426
You listening, sefton?

01:13:57.558 --> 01:14:00.049
Yeah, I still got one good ear.

01:14:00.186 --> 01:14:02.768
Now you listen to me.

01:14:02.897 --> 01:14:05.934
Two guys in this barracks know
I didn't do it.

01:14:06.067 --> 01:14:10.686
Me and the guy that did do it.
It could be any one of you.

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:16.612
You, hoffy, or Duke, or price,
the animal, or blondie, or even Joey.

01:14:18.162 --> 01:14:21.370
And he'd better watch out,
the guy that left me holding the stick.

01:14:21.499 --> 01:14:23.660
Because if there's any throats cut
in this barracks...

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:29.288
Achtung! Everybody at attention
for the Geneva man!

01:14:34.261 --> 01:14:36.547
As you were, gentlemen, please.

01:14:37.640 --> 01:14:41.053
Here we have a typical barrack.
It houses 75 men.

01:14:41.185 --> 01:14:43.801
Every one of them has
his own bunk, naturally.

01:14:43.938 --> 01:14:48.022
Naturally. It would be rather awkward
to have three men in one bunk.

01:14:48.150 --> 01:14:52.314
As for the blankets, you will notice
they are very warm. 50 per cent wool.

01:14:52.446 --> 01:14:54.732
They also smell of mothballs.

01:14:54.865 --> 01:14:57.572
When were they issued?
This morning?

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:04.034
What do you do for heat
in this barrack? No stove!

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:08.284
The men used it as a trap door,
so we had to remove it temporarily.

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:12.380
How long is temporarily?
I trust not until July.

01:15:12.508 --> 01:15:14.840
Here you see a typical meal
the prisoners are getting.

01:15:14.969 --> 01:15:19.178
- Schulz, what are they having today?
- Bean soup mit ham hocks.

01:15:19.306 --> 01:15:21.388
- Would you like to taste it?
- Thank you, no.

01:15:21.517 --> 01:15:25.055
Where's the ham hock?
There should be a ham hock!

01:15:25.187 --> 01:15:27.644
When you find it,
we'll send it to Geneva.

01:15:29.442 --> 01:15:32.650
Are there any complaints?
Please speak up.

01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:36.358
Don't be afraid to talk.

01:15:36.490 --> 01:15:39.232
That's what
the Geneva convention is for,

01:15:39.368 --> 01:15:41.654
to protect the rights
of prisoners of war,

01:15:41.787 --> 01:15:44.824
whether they are Americans
or Germans.

01:15:44.957 --> 01:15:47.790
- What have you got to say?
- I like it here.

01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:58.050
- What about you?
- It's all right, considering.

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:05.391
What happened to you?
Were you beaten?

01:16:05.519 --> 01:16:08.886
Why don't you answer?
What did you do to this man?

01:16:09.023 --> 01:16:11.014
They didn't do nothing.

01:16:11.150 --> 01:16:13.232
- Who beat you?
- Nobody beat me.

01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:16.272
We were playing pinochle.
It's a rough game.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:19.647
Pardon me, sir.
Since you want us to speak up.

01:16:19.784 --> 01:16:23.902
A man was removed from this barracks
last night, a lieutenant dunbar.

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:27.701
We'd appreciate you looking into it,
if they haven't shot him yet.

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:31.451
- Why was he arrested?
- Sabotage. He blew up a train.

01:16:31.587 --> 01:16:33.498
They'd have to prove that first.

01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:37.374
The Geneva convention says
you can't just shoot a man.

01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:40.502
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.
I didn't do it...

01:16:40.638 --> 01:16:46.599
Of course you did. 26 carloads
of munition gone off like a trick cigar.

01:16:46.727 --> 01:16:49.139
The ss is running around in circles.

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:51.683
The gestapo is arresting
the wrong people.

01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:57.027
And Von scherbach has caught the fish.
Most amusing, isn't it?

01:16:57.154 --> 01:17:01.318
Ah-ah! You are being rude again.

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:03.611
I just wanna go to sleep.

01:17:03.744 --> 01:17:08.784
9:30. General Von pfeffinger
will be at his desk by now.

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:11.953
Shall we call Berlin
and tell him the good news?

01:17:12.086 --> 01:17:14.372
I didn't do it. I didn't...

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:22.047
I hope you appreciate this moment,
lieutenant.

01:17:22.179 --> 01:17:24.420
You see, I'm a cavalry man.

01:17:24.557 --> 01:17:27.014
All the Von scherbachs
were cavalry men.

01:17:27.143 --> 01:17:30.101
Well, you know
what happened to the cavalry.

01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:34.393
Just give me five minutes
on that couch, will you?

01:17:34.525 --> 01:17:37.392
The young ones,
they put into the panzer divisions.

01:17:37.528 --> 01:17:41.316
The older ones,
they put in the quartermaster corps

01:17:41.448 --> 01:17:45.691
or made them recruiting officers,
or wardens like me.

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:48.786
Wet nurses to putrid prisoners.

01:17:48.914 --> 01:17:53.749
In Berlin, they have forgotten that
colonel Von scherbach even exists.

01:17:53.878 --> 01:17:55.960
But they will remember now.

01:18:24.575 --> 01:18:29.990
Well, there will be two ss men here
tomorrow to take you to Berlin.

01:18:31.373 --> 01:18:35.286
You will be interrogated
by the general staff.

01:18:35.419 --> 01:18:38.411
When it comes to the part
about your arrest,

01:18:38.547 --> 01:18:42.961
I'm sure you won't forget
to give me the proper credit.

01:18:43.093 --> 01:18:46.756
I just wanna sleep.
I haven't slept in three days.

01:18:46.889 --> 01:18:52.634
You will remember the name.
Scherbach, Von scherbach.

01:19:02.821 --> 01:19:06.188
Well, herr inspektor,
how did you find the camp?

01:19:06.325 --> 01:19:09.408
Crowded, but âgemditlich',
shall we say?

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:11.652
I want to talk about
lieutenant dunbar.

01:19:11.789 --> 01:19:14.371
- Is this lieutenant dunbar?
- Tis.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.365
What exactly is he charged with?

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:18.993
Whatever it is,
it's out of your jurisdiction.

01:19:19.129 --> 01:19:24.920
This man is not a prisoner of war.
Not any more. He's a saboteur.

01:19:25.052 --> 01:19:28.590
He's a prisoner of war
until you can prove sabotage.

01:19:28.722 --> 01:19:32.761
I didn't do it.
I was in the Frankfurt station.

01:19:32.893 --> 01:19:35.726
The train was three miles away
when it blew up.

01:19:35.854 --> 01:19:38.061
Come now, you threw a time bomb.

01:19:38.190 --> 01:19:40.852
How could I have had a time bomb?

01:19:40.985 --> 01:19:43.146
They searched me
when they took me prisoner.

01:19:43.279 --> 01:19:46.863
The way you search your prisoners,
it sounds rather unlikely.

01:19:46.991 --> 01:19:49.903
All I know is he did it.
I am satisfied.

01:19:50.035 --> 01:19:52.902
I am not. According to the Geneva
convention, this man...

01:19:53.038 --> 01:19:57.498
Is there anything in the Geneva
convention that'll let a guy sleep?

01:20:00.879 --> 01:20:03.211
- You were saying?
- Simply this.

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:08.175
After the hostilities are ended,
there will be a war crimes commission.

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:11.387
If the man should be convicted
without proper proof,

01:20:11.515 --> 01:20:14.507
you will be held responsible,
oberst Von scherbach.

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:16.679
- Interesting.
- Isn't it?

01:20:18.772 --> 01:20:22.515
Very well,
if you insist on details,

01:20:22.651 --> 01:20:26.439
I have ways of finding out
about that blasted time bomb.

01:20:27.865 --> 01:20:32.404
Good day, sir. You will forgive me
for receiving you like this.

01:20:32.536 --> 01:20:35.994
Perfectly all right.
I do not like boots.

01:20:36.999 --> 01:20:40.491
- Schulz!
- Herr oberst.

01:21:19.249 --> 01:21:22.082
I believe it. I believe it.

01:21:27.174 --> 01:21:30.132
Let's have your dogtags
for the Christmas tree.

01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:32.421
What's the idea?
You think can eat that stuff?

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:35.921
We're building a smudge pot
so patton can find us when he comes.

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:39.391
Twenty parts of cellulose,
one part phosphorous. Watch.

01:21:45.401 --> 01:21:48.143
He'll be able to see our smoke signal
four miles away.

01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:50.644
But patton is 400 miles away.

01:21:50.781 --> 01:21:53.648
- Well, I say, be prepared.
- Ok, boy scout.

01:21:53.784 --> 01:21:57.652
- Hey, look what we've got!
- The phonograph! Music!

01:21:57.788 --> 01:21:59.699
Put it down here, boys.

01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:01.538
We made a deal with barracks 1.

01:22:01.667 --> 01:22:04.659
- Now, where's that distillery?
- Over here, boys.

01:22:08.715 --> 01:22:10.876
Let's have that distillery.

01:22:11.009 --> 01:22:14.843
Come on, we swapped it for
the phonograph. Any objections, sefton?

01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:18.717
Take it.

01:22:40.414 --> 01:22:43.201
Hey, price. Any news on dunbar?

01:22:43.333 --> 01:22:47.667
He's still at the kommandant's office,
that's all I know. Don't worry.

01:22:59.433 --> 01:23:03.267
J when Johnny comes marching
home again, hurrah, hurrah!

01:23:03.395 --> 01:23:07.058
J we'll give him a hearty welcome then,
hurrah, hurrah!

01:23:07.191 --> 01:23:10.683
J the men will cheer, the boys will shout
the ladies they will all turn out

01:23:10.819 --> 01:23:14.607

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:44.968

01:23:45.103 --> 01:23:49.062

01:24:21.640 --> 01:24:25.349

01:24:54.631 --> 01:24:58.123

01:25:05.559 --> 01:25:07.641
j la-la-la... j

01:25:48.268 --> 01:25:50.384
This kid's too good for me.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:53.387
Let's see how good he is.
Same stakes?

01:25:53.523 --> 01:25:55.388
Sure. Go ahead.

01:26:03.408 --> 01:26:04.898
That's not bad.

01:26:07.245 --> 01:26:10.612
- Where did you learn your pitching?
- From the farmer's daughter.

01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:15.788
Something I was meaning
to ask you about security.

01:26:15.921 --> 01:26:17.036
Shoot.

01:26:17.172 --> 01:26:19.709
We're having a tough time
keeping stuff hidden from the krauts,

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:24.255
like our escape equipment,
so we're always looking for new devices.

01:26:24.388 --> 01:26:26.219
- Looks like you found one.
- Me?

01:26:26.348 --> 01:26:29.135
I mean the lieutenant.
He hid a time bomb on him, right?

01:26:29.267 --> 01:26:32.100
He even carried it
through prisoner's search, didn't he?

01:26:32.229 --> 01:26:34.811
- Where did he hide it?
- Right in his pocket.

01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:37.773
- The old cigarette-match gag.
- What's that?

01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:41.814
You take a book of matches,
light a cigarette, slip it in.

01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:44.814
It takes about three minutes
for the cigarette to burn down.

01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:48.067
Then it sets off the matches.
Simple.

01:26:50.163 --> 01:26:51.778
Some time bomb.

01:26:54.835 --> 01:26:57.121
Hey, that's a ringer.

01:26:57.254 --> 01:27:02.123
J o come ye, o come ye

01:27:02.259 --> 01:27:06.548
j to Bethlehem

01:27:07.681 --> 01:27:12.846
j come and behold him

01:27:12.978 --> 01:27:15.560
j born the king of angels...

01:27:26.783 --> 01:27:28.774
Don't forget the corkscrew.

01:27:32.622 --> 01:27:34.613
And have a cigar.

01:27:35.959 --> 01:27:37.165
Thanks.

01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:52.097
J ...Joyful and triumphant

01:27:52.225 --> 01:27:57.265
j o come ye, o come ye

01:27:57.397 --> 01:28:01.982
j to Bethlehem

01:28:02.861 --> 01:28:05.694
j come and behold him...

01:28:09.493 --> 01:28:13.577
- Here's a present for you, Joey.
- Take it. Take it.

01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:15.866
It's Christmas, Joey.

01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:19.241
"Merry Christmas to Joey
from the gang."

01:28:21.004 --> 01:28:22.540
Open it.

01:28:23.673 --> 01:28:25.664
I'll open it for you.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:33.297
Come on, Joey, play.

01:28:56.331 --> 01:28:59.915
Air raid! Air raid!
Everybody out of the barracks!

01:29:00.877 --> 01:29:05.120
- Not on Christmas Eve!
- For your own good, you must get out.

01:29:05.257 --> 01:29:08.465
- And put out those candles.
- Let's hit the trenches.

01:29:08.593 --> 01:29:12.302
- I'll bet it's a phoney again.
- The Pentagon will hear about this!

01:29:12.430 --> 01:29:14.716
I'm not really built for war.

01:29:14.850 --> 01:29:19.184
Get out! Everybody in the trenches.
Quick. Raus!

01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:27.772
Hey, what's the matter with you?

01:29:27.904 --> 01:29:31.112
- You want to get killed?
- Not particularly.

01:29:34.744 --> 01:29:37.156
Hey, you two. Outside with youl!

01:29:41.626 --> 01:29:43.617
Must you two always be the last?

01:29:43.753 --> 01:29:46.620
Oh, yeah? You try jumping
in those trenches first.

01:29:46.756 --> 01:29:48.997
Everybody jumps in on top of you.

01:29:49.134 --> 01:29:53.002
- How do you think I got my hernia?
- Go on, let's go.

01:30:37.223 --> 01:30:38.884
Ach, so?

01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:42.346
Ach, so!

01:31:00.705 --> 01:31:03.162
"Ach, so..."

01:31:09.255 --> 01:31:12.622
'So it got to be
Christmas day in stalag 17.

01:31:12.759 --> 01:31:15.125
"If you ask me, it was
more like the fourth of July

01:31:15.261 --> 01:31:20.255
'with all the fireworks that were to go off
and bust the camp wide open.

01:31:20.392 --> 01:31:24.385
'It started off innocently,
with a party going on in every barracks.'

01:31:25.397 --> 01:31:31.358
j I love you

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:37.197
j is all that I can say

01:31:37.325 --> 01:31:43.245
j I love you

01:31:43.373 --> 01:31:49.460
j the same old words
I'm saying in the same old way

01:31:49.587 --> 01:31:55.332
j I love you

01:31:55.468 --> 01:32:01.464
j three words that are divine

01:32:01.599 --> 01:32:04.511
j and now, my dear

01:32:04.644 --> 01:32:07.351
j I'm waiting to hear

01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:12.440
j the words that make you mine... j

01:32:49.898 --> 01:32:53.265
Come on, animal,
let's trip the light fantastic.

01:32:53.401 --> 01:32:55.392
Leave me alone.

01:32:57.655 --> 01:33:01.193
Don't cry over a dame that
doesn't even know you're alive.

01:33:01.326 --> 01:33:03.487
Snap out of it!

01:33:03.620 --> 01:33:08.455
There's a time in every man's life
when he wants to be left alone.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:10.619
So go away.

01:33:50.959 --> 01:33:54.451
All right, who wants
the queen of the may?

01:33:57.173 --> 01:33:59.084
How about you, handsome?

01:33:59.217 --> 01:34:02.380
You look like Cary Grant.
Wanna dance with me?

01:34:02.512 --> 01:34:07.757
I'd love to, queenie, but one
of the other girls asked me first.

01:34:07.892 --> 01:34:09.473
Bye, darling.

01:34:10.603 --> 01:34:12.184
Bye.

01:34:22.907 --> 01:34:24.898
Any cigars left, cookie?

01:34:29.706 --> 01:34:32.197
Come on, cookie, get me a cigar.

01:34:36.504 --> 01:34:40.668
What's the matter?
Are you on their team now?

01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:42.631
Think I'm the guy?

01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:46.836
I don't know what to think any more.

01:34:47.932 --> 01:34:50.093
I understand how you feel.

01:34:51.186 --> 01:34:55.930
It's sort of rough, one American
squealing on other Americans.

01:35:00.028 --> 01:35:05.398
Then again, cookie, maybe
that stoolie's not an American at all.

01:35:05.533 --> 01:35:09.617
Maybe he's a German
the krauts planted in this barracks.

01:35:09.746 --> 01:35:11.987
They do that sometimes.

01:35:12.123 --> 01:35:16.457
Just put an agent in with us,
a trained specialist.

01:35:18.421 --> 01:35:21.788
Lots of loose information
floating around a prison camp.

01:35:21.925 --> 01:35:25.008
Not just whether somebody's
trying to escape,

01:35:25.136 --> 01:35:27.593
but what outfit we were with,

01:35:27.722 --> 01:35:30.088
where we were stationed,

01:35:30.225 --> 01:35:32.432
how our radar operates.

01:35:34.062 --> 01:35:37.520
- Could be, couldn't it?
- In this barracks?

01:35:37.649 --> 01:35:43.315
Why not? Just one of the boys.
Sharing our bunks, eating our chow.

01:35:44.948 --> 01:35:47.940
Right amongst those that beat me up.

01:35:49.619 --> 01:35:52.110
Except he beat hardest.

01:35:52.956 --> 01:35:55.993
- Who is it?
- That's not the point, cookie.

01:35:56.125 --> 01:35:59.538
The point is:
What do you do with him?

01:35:59.671 --> 01:36:03.255
You tip your mitt and the jerries
plant him in someplace else

01:36:03.383 --> 01:36:05.795
like stalag 16 or 15.

01:36:06.719 --> 01:36:11.463
Or you kill him off and
the krauts kill off the whole barracks.

01:36:11.599 --> 01:36:13.590
Every one of us.

01:36:15.061 --> 01:36:17.427
So what do you do?

01:36:17.563 --> 01:36:23.934
Who is it? If you don't want to tell me,
why don't you tell hoffy, or security?

01:36:26.197 --> 01:36:27.607
Yeah...

01:36:28.866 --> 01:36:30.572
Security.

01:36:38.584 --> 01:36:41.417
What's keeping hoffy?
Why don't we get news about dunbar?

01:36:41.546 --> 01:36:44.253
He'll be back. They've got no proof.

01:36:44.382 --> 01:36:48.091
Come on, boys. Soft and sweet.

01:36:50.138 --> 01:36:51.799
Beguile me.

01:37:29.886 --> 01:37:31.046
Betty...

01:37:32.388 --> 01:37:33.753
Betty!

01:37:57.205 --> 01:38:01.198
- May I have this dance, miss?
- Why, sure.

01:38:28.152 --> 01:38:30.564
Pinch me, darling.

01:38:30.696 --> 01:38:33.813
Pinch me, so I'll know
I'm not dreaming.

01:38:36.536 --> 01:38:37.992
Thank you, darling.

01:38:39.747 --> 01:38:46.835
J I love you

01:38:46.963 --> 01:38:52.208
j three words that are divine

01:38:54.178 --> 01:38:57.762
j and now, my dear

01:38:57.890 --> 01:39:01.257
j I'm waiting to hear

01:39:01.394 --> 01:39:06.559
j the words that make you mine j

01:39:11.821 --> 01:39:16.815
Did anyone ever tell you, you had
the most beautiful legs in the world?

01:39:20.371 --> 01:39:26.458
But it's not just your legs.
I'm crazy about that little nose of yours.

01:39:28.254 --> 01:39:31.291
That cute little button of a nose.

01:39:33.217 --> 01:39:34.923
Hey, animal? Animal!

01:39:36.012 --> 01:39:38.503
I've been crazy about you for years.

01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:43.724
I've seen every picture
you ever made... six times!

01:39:45.438 --> 01:39:48.601
I'd just sit there, watching you.

01:39:50.193 --> 01:39:53.902
I wouldn't even open up the popcorn bag.

01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:57.522
Animal, animal!
Wake up. Wake up!

01:39:57.658 --> 01:40:00.570
Betty... Betty!

01:40:05.208 --> 01:40:08.120
Animal, this is me, Harry shapiro.

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:13.371
Harry shapiro!

01:40:16.219 --> 01:40:17.834
Harry...

01:40:31.400 --> 01:40:34.107
Cut the music.
Cut the music! Cut ijt!

01:40:34.237 --> 01:40:37.650
At ease, at ease!
Somebody cover the doors.

01:40:40.284 --> 01:40:44.823
Listen! The ss men are here for dunbar.
They're taking him to Berlin.

01:40:44.956 --> 01:40:47.993
- They got proof. Looks like he's finished.
- Only not quite yet.

01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:50.116
Hoffy and I have figured a long shot.

01:40:50.253 --> 01:40:52.619
- All the barracks are behind us.
- What are you gonna do?

01:40:52.755 --> 01:40:56.998
Blondie, get that smudge pot.
Tie it to Steve's leg.

01:40:57.134 --> 01:41:00.922
I want everybody out. We need
a lot of commotion in the compound.

01:41:01.055 --> 01:41:02.841
I'll get the men
from the other barracks.

01:41:02.974 --> 01:41:05.340
You think you can snatch
dunbar from the ss?

01:41:05.476 --> 01:41:09.845
We're gonna make a stab at it.
Duke, price, stosh, Harry...

01:41:09.981 --> 01:41:12.723
Meet at the north latrine.
You'll all get your posts.

01:41:12.858 --> 01:41:16.476
Now everybody start drifting out,
one by one.

01:41:25.663 --> 01:41:28.370
Easy, boys, easy.
Disperse out there nicely.

01:41:28.499 --> 01:41:32.993
Remember, just because the krauts are
dumb, it doesn't mean they're stupid.

01:41:35.298 --> 01:41:36.538
- Ready?
- Roger.

01:41:36.674 --> 01:41:38.084
Ok, move out.

01:41:41.596 --> 01:41:43.837
I don't know what your scheme is,
but it sounds crazy.

01:41:43.973 --> 01:41:47.761
It may be crazy, but it's better
than having dunbar dead.

01:41:47.893 --> 01:41:52.307
I guess you're right. How about me
keeping schulz off balance?

01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:56.228
- Good.
- I'd worry about sefton, not schulz.

01:41:58.571 --> 01:42:02.985
- Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
- You won't squeal this one, brother.

01:42:03.117 --> 01:42:07.736
No? Aren't you afraid to turn
the stoolie loose on the compound?

01:42:07.872 --> 01:42:10.113
For a tip-off like this,
what the krauts would pay?

01:42:10.249 --> 01:42:13.537
You'll stay in the barracks,
and not a peep out of you.

01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:17.127
Ok, put a guard on me.
I want you to.

01:42:17.256 --> 01:42:21.795
Because if anything goes wrong,
this time you won't have a patsy. Right?

01:42:21.927 --> 01:42:24.885
- Right.
- So, who's gonna watch me?

01:42:25.014 --> 01:42:27.972
Cookie? No, not cookie.

01:42:28.934 --> 01:42:32.176
Wouldn't you feel safer
with security on the job?

01:42:33.731 --> 01:42:37.599
- Ok, price, you stay here.
- What about schulz?

01:42:38.444 --> 01:42:41.652
We'll take care of schulz.
Come on. You, too.

01:43:02.343 --> 01:43:05.881
That's the boy, Joey.
Play us a little something.

01:43:06.013 --> 01:43:09.176
What do you want to hear, price?
"Home on the range"?

01:43:09.308 --> 01:43:11.674
Or maybe a little Wagner?

01:43:11.811 --> 01:43:14.143
Or how about a game of pinochle?

01:43:16.816 --> 01:43:19.057
No, you're not a pinochle man.

01:43:20.361 --> 01:43:22.352
You're a chess player.

01:43:23.906 --> 01:43:26.943
I never knew much about the game.

01:43:27.076 --> 01:43:28.657
Now, let's see...

01:43:29.787 --> 01:43:35.623
A pawn moves this way,
and a bishop this way,

01:43:37.211 --> 01:43:40.749
and the queen moves
every which way, doesn't it?

01:43:40.881 --> 01:43:43.873
Suppose you sit down
and keep your mouth shut!

01:43:46.929 --> 01:43:51.798
I went to school with a guy
named price. That was in Boston.

01:43:52.893 --> 01:43:56.135
- You're from Cleveland, aren't you?
- Yeah, I'm from Cleveland.

01:43:56.272 --> 01:43:59.981
I thought that was what you said.
You're from Cleveland.

01:44:00.109 --> 01:44:04.227
- You were with the 36th bomb group?
- 35th.

01:44:04.363 --> 01:44:08.151
The 366th bomb squadron
out of chelveston?

01:44:08.284 --> 01:44:10.275
Are you questioning me?

01:44:12.329 --> 01:44:16.538
Just getting acquainted. I'd like
to make one friend in this barracks.

01:44:16.667 --> 01:44:20.285
Don't bother.
I never liked you and I never will.

01:44:20.421 --> 01:44:23.458
Many people say that
and then they get married,

01:44:23.591 --> 01:44:25.707
and live happily ever after.

01:44:30.139 --> 01:44:32.551
I wonder what they're trying
to pull out there.

01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:28.462
'Where was dunbar?

01:46:28.591 --> 01:46:31.549
'It sure drove the krauts crazy,
looking for him.

01:46:31.677 --> 01:46:36.888
'They herded us out, put extra machine
guns on us and gave us a picture check.

01:46:37.016 --> 01:46:41.259
'You know, checking our dogtags
and our pans against their index file.

01:46:41.395 --> 01:46:43.761
'Nobody knew
where dunbar was hidden.

01:46:43.898 --> 01:46:47.356
'Nobody except hoffy,
and he wouldn't even tell us.

01:47:01.916 --> 01:47:04.658
'The krauts searched
under the barracks, on the roofs,

01:47:04.793 --> 01:47:07.660
'they even searched the bathroom
in the kommandant's office.

01:47:07.796 --> 01:47:09.411
'But no dunbar.

01:47:09.548 --> 01:47:12.756
"Then they tried to smoke him out
with tear gas bombs in every barracks,

01:47:12.885 --> 01:47:15.501
'just in case he was hiding
up in the rafters.

01:47:15.638 --> 01:47:17.754
'Then they made us stand
for six hours out there

01:47:17.890 --> 01:47:21.428
'until finally Von scherbach came out
and gave us his ultimatum.

01:47:21.560 --> 01:47:23.471
'If dunbar didn't come out
by next morning,

01:47:23.604 --> 01:47:26.892
'he'd tear down the whole
lousy compound, stick by stick.

01:47:27.024 --> 01:47:31.984
'And if we slept in the mud for the rest
of our lives, that was okay by him.

01:47:32.112 --> 01:47:35.650
'He couldn't figure how a guy
could disappear from the compound

01:47:35.783 --> 01:47:37.489
'and still be there.

01:47:37.618 --> 01:47:39.609
'But dunbar was there all right.

01:47:39.745 --> 01:47:41.576
'He sure was there.'

01:48:20.536 --> 01:48:24.745
Let's have it understood. This'll be
a rough deal, but we've got no choice.

01:48:24.873 --> 01:48:28.081
One of us will have to take dunbar
out of the camp tonight.

01:48:28.210 --> 01:48:31.919
We'll draw one dogtag
to see who does the job.

01:48:32.047 --> 01:48:35.289
The krauts are expecting
a move like this

01:48:35.426 --> 01:48:37.758
and they've put on extra guards.

01:48:39.471 --> 01:48:42.963
Now, if anybody wants to withdraw,
speak up.

01:48:46.729 --> 01:48:48.720
Then we're all in on it.

01:48:48.856 --> 01:48:52.474
Everybody but Joey...
And you know who.

01:48:57.197 --> 01:49:00.360
All right, who's the lucky one?

01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:05.944
Let me do it, hoffy.

01:49:06.081 --> 01:49:09.744
- You wanna go?
- No, I just wanna draw.

01:49:09.877 --> 01:49:11.492
Ok, draw.

01:49:18.135 --> 01:49:21.002
Suppose we call this my tag.
I'll take him out.

01:49:21.138 --> 01:49:23.504
No volunteers. We're all in on it.

01:49:23.640 --> 01:49:25.551
You elected me security.

01:49:25.684 --> 01:49:28.801
The way things have been going,
I've done a poor job

01:49:28.937 --> 01:49:31.644
and I want to make it up.
Am I asking too much?

01:49:31.774 --> 01:49:35.813
- We've all done a poor job.
- I still say this is my tag.

01:49:35.944 --> 01:49:39.061
Any objections, hoffy?

01:49:39.198 --> 01:49:41.063
- Any objections, men?
- Not from me.

01:49:41.200 --> 01:49:43.361
- He can have it.
- Who are we to argue with a hero?

01:49:43.494 --> 01:49:46.201
- How about me latching on?
- Three's a crowd.

01:49:46.330 --> 01:49:48.787
Especially if you've gotta cut
your way through barbed wire.

01:49:48.916 --> 01:49:50.907
Let's have the wire cutters.

01:49:52.377 --> 01:49:54.333
- Are the civilian clothes ready?
- Coming up.

01:49:54.463 --> 01:49:56.454
Get to work on the trap door.

01:50:00.677 --> 01:50:04.044
What do you say, hoffy,
we hit the air-raid trenches,

01:50:04.181 --> 01:50:06.638
then cut out back at barracks 97

01:50:06.767 --> 01:50:08.883
you'd better cut out
back of the south latrine.

01:50:09.019 --> 01:50:12.887
- Why the south latrine?
- Because he's there. In the water tank.

01:50:14.108 --> 01:50:15.644
Good spot.

01:50:15.776 --> 01:50:19.360
With any luck, we may be
in krems by morning.

01:50:19.488 --> 01:50:22.355
Maybe even catch a barge
up to linz.

01:50:22.491 --> 01:50:25.449
Two packs of cigarettes say dunbar
never gets out of the compound.

01:50:25.577 --> 01:50:27.784
Are you starting that again?

01:50:27.913 --> 01:50:30.825
- Anybody cover?
- Somebody step on that crumb.

01:50:30.958 --> 01:50:33.540
- We warned you, sefton.
- Sure you warned me.

01:50:33.669 --> 01:50:36.126
You were gonna slit the throat
of that stoolie.

01:50:37.256 --> 01:50:39.338
Here's the knife to do it with.

01:50:40.717 --> 01:50:44.005
- Make sure you get the right throat.
- We're looking at it.

01:50:44.138 --> 01:50:47.380
Hurry up on that trap door.
Are you trying to gum up the works?

01:50:47.516 --> 01:50:48.847
That's right.

01:50:48.976 --> 01:50:52.969
Or would you rather see dunbar lying
in the mud like manfredi and jonson?

01:50:53.105 --> 01:50:56.518
My hands were full keeping
these guys from tearing you apart.

01:50:56.650 --> 01:50:58.140
I called it last time, didn't I?

01:50:58.277 --> 01:51:02.270
Are we gonna listen to him until
the Germans find out where dunbar is?

01:51:02.406 --> 01:51:04.192
They know where dunbar is.

01:51:04.324 --> 01:51:06.815
- How do they know?
- You told them, hoffy.

01:51:06.952 --> 01:51:08.908
- Who did?
- You did.

01:51:09.037 --> 01:51:13.827
- Are you off your rocker?
- Uh-huh. Fell right on my head.

01:51:18.547 --> 01:51:21.584
- Sprechen sie deutsch?
- No, I don't "sprechen sie deutsch."

01:51:21.717 --> 01:51:24.208
Maybe just one word? Kaputt?

01:51:24.344 --> 01:51:27.677
- Because you're kaputt!
- Get him out of my hair so I can go.

01:51:27.806 --> 01:51:30.172
To the kommandant's office
and tell him where dunbar is?

01:51:30.309 --> 01:51:32.265
I'll kill you for...

01:51:32.394 --> 01:51:33.850
Shut up!

01:51:33.979 --> 01:51:37.392
Security officer, huh?
Always screening everybody.

01:51:37.524 --> 01:51:38.980
Only who screens you?

01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:41.350
Great American hero
from Cleveland, Ohio,

01:51:41.486 --> 01:51:43.192
enlisted right after Pearl harbor.

01:51:43.322 --> 01:51:45.438
When was Pearl harbor
or don't you know?

01:51:45.574 --> 01:51:47.656
- December 7th, '41.
- What time?

01:51:47.784 --> 01:51:49.775
Six o'clock, I was having dinner.

01:51:49.912 --> 01:51:52.244
Six o'clock in Berlin.

01:51:52.372 --> 01:51:55.159
They were having lunch
in Cleveland.

01:51:55.292 --> 01:51:57.749
- Am I boring you, boys?
- Go on.

01:51:57.878 --> 01:52:00.369
He's a Nazi, price is!

01:52:00.505 --> 01:52:03.417
For all I know, his name is
preissinger or preisshoffer.

01:52:03.550 --> 01:52:06.383
Sure he lived in Cleveland,
but when war broke out

01:52:06.511 --> 01:52:08.923
he came back to the fatherland
like a good little bundist.

01:52:09.056 --> 01:52:11.388
He spoke our lingo,
so they sent him to spy school

01:52:11.516 --> 01:52:13.131
and fixed him up
with phoney dogtags.

01:52:13.268 --> 01:52:15.429
He's just trying to get himself
off the hook!

01:52:15.562 --> 01:52:18.520
- He said, "shut up."
- You heard what he said.

01:52:18.649 --> 01:52:22.267
Okay, herr preisshoffer,
let's have the mailbox.

01:52:22.402 --> 01:52:23.892
The what?

01:52:24.029 --> 01:52:28.443
The one you took out from the corner
of your bunk and put in this pocket.

01:52:30.744 --> 01:52:32.780
Let me show you how they did it.

01:52:34.122 --> 01:52:35.612
They did it by mail.

01:52:35.749 --> 01:52:37.080
- Mail?
- That's right.

01:52:37.209 --> 01:52:40.246
Little love notes between our
security officer and Von scherbach,

01:52:40.379 --> 01:52:42.495
with schulz the mailman.

01:52:42.631 --> 01:52:44.462
Here's the flag.

01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:48.584
They used to put a loop in the cord.
Did you ever notice?

01:52:50.097 --> 01:52:55.217
And here's the mailboxes.
Hollow black queens.

01:52:58.230 --> 01:53:00.516
Cute, huh?

01:53:00.649 --> 01:53:03.686
They delivered or picked up the mail
when we were out of the barracks,

01:53:03.819 --> 01:53:05.855
like for appell.

01:53:05.988 --> 01:53:08.900
When there was a special delivery,
they'd pull a phoney air raid,

01:53:09.032 --> 01:53:12.695
to get us out,
like last night, for instance.

01:53:12.828 --> 01:53:16.320
There wasn't a plane in the sky.
Or was there, price?

01:54:07.090 --> 01:54:09.627
Brother, were we all wet about you?

01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:11.500
Forget it.

01:54:25.233 --> 01:54:28.441
- What are we gonna do with him?
- Don't you know?

01:54:28.570 --> 01:54:30.811
Because I got my own ideas.

01:54:30.947 --> 01:54:32.938
Let's have that civilian stuff.

01:54:38.830 --> 01:54:43.119
I'll look pretty stupid in this,
yodelling my way across the alps.

01:54:43.251 --> 01:54:45.708
Now, let's have the wire cutters.

01:54:47.172 --> 01:54:50.130
- Are you taking dunbar?
- You betcha.

01:54:50.258 --> 01:54:55.093
There ought to be some reward money
from mama. About 10,000 bucks' worth.

01:54:57.474 --> 01:54:59.931
I told you boys I'm no escape artist.

01:55:00.060 --> 01:55:04.269
For the first time, I like the odds,
because now I got me a decoy.

01:55:04.398 --> 01:55:07.060
- What's the decoy?
- Price.

01:55:09.403 --> 01:55:12.770
When I go,
give me exactly five minutes

01:55:12.906 --> 01:55:15.488
to get dunbar
out of that water tank.

01:55:15.617 --> 01:55:18.654
Then throw price into the compound,
nice and loud.

01:55:18.787 --> 01:55:21.529
He'll draw every light
from every goon tower.

01:55:21.665 --> 01:55:24.156
It's our only chance to cut through.

01:55:25.877 --> 01:55:28.664
What do you say, barracks chief?

01:55:28.797 --> 01:55:32.210
He's right, hoffy,
it's either price or dunbar.

01:55:32.342 --> 01:55:34.799
He killed jonson and manfredi,
didn't he?

01:55:37.055 --> 01:55:38.636
It's all yours.

01:55:42.477 --> 01:55:45.890
What's the matter, price?
You said you were gonna save dunbar?

01:55:46.022 --> 01:55:48.308
So now you're getting your chance.

01:55:48.442 --> 01:55:51.980
So long, cookie. You can have
the department store, what's left of it.

01:55:52.112 --> 01:55:53.977
So long, sefton.

01:55:54.114 --> 01:55:56.981
You're not disposing of those
Russian broads, are you?

01:55:57.117 --> 01:56:00.655
Tell you what to do. Get yourself
100 cigarettes for the kraut guards.

01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:03.995
Then get yourself another face.

01:56:04.124 --> 01:56:06.615
You could use a new one too.

01:56:06.751 --> 01:56:08.867
Let's synchronise the watches.

01:56:09.004 --> 01:56:12.121
It's 11:42 sharp.

01:56:12.257 --> 01:56:13.713
Check.

01:56:15.844 --> 01:56:17.675
Just one more word.

01:56:17.804 --> 01:56:20.341
If I ever run into any of you bums
on a street corner,

01:56:20.474 --> 01:56:22.840
let's pretend we never met before.

01:57:47.978 --> 01:57:51.266
Shut up the moaning or
you'll have the machine guns on us.

01:57:51.398 --> 01:57:53.354
Shut it off, lieutenant.

01:57:53.483 --> 01:57:56.190
My legs are frozen.

01:57:59.197 --> 01:58:01.654
You'd better get
that blue blood circulating,

01:58:01.783 --> 01:58:04.365
cos we're busting out
of this stink hole

01:58:04.494 --> 01:58:07.611
in exactly one minute
and 20 seconds.

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:09.203
Sefton...

01:58:09.332 --> 01:58:12.039
- Did you expect a St. Bernard dog?
- Not you.

01:58:12.168 --> 01:58:14.124
- Want some Brandy?
- Yeah.

01:58:14.254 --> 01:58:18.714
Who doesn't? Suppose we wait
till we hit the Waldorf astoria, huh?

01:58:18.842 --> 01:58:21.925
Okay, it's on me.

01:58:22.053 --> 01:58:25.386
You won't get off that cheap.

01:58:25.515 --> 01:58:28.803
What are our chances
of busting out of here?

01:58:29.978 --> 01:58:32.264
We'll know in about 40 seconds.

01:58:36.943 --> 01:58:39.025
Hold his leg up.

01:58:40.614 --> 01:58:43.481
Just in case your kameraden
are hard-of-hearing.

01:58:43.617 --> 01:58:45.448
Thirty seconds. Get him up.

01:58:49.372 --> 01:58:53.786
Stop shaking, price.
There'll be no pardon from no governor.

01:58:53.918 --> 01:58:57.877
Funny, ain't it? In your own fatherland,
by your own soldaten.

01:58:59.424 --> 01:59:01.506
This kid's got no sense of humour.

01:59:01.635 --> 01:59:04.468
Twenty seconds. Open the hatch.

01:59:16.733 --> 01:59:19.850
What's the matter with you, security?
You were always so calm.

01:59:19.986 --> 01:59:23.069
Especially when you let manfredi
and jonson go out there.

01:59:23.198 --> 01:59:28.113
Eight seconds,
seven, six, five, four,

01:59:28.244 --> 01:59:32.408
three, two, one, go!

01:59:41.966 --> 01:59:43.251
Hilfe!

02:00:14.499 --> 02:00:15.909
This is it!

02:00:46.781 --> 02:00:49.193
- Let's blow, chauncey.
- Let's.

02:01:31.075 --> 02:01:35.694
All right, men. Everybody back
in their bunks like nothing happened.

02:01:59.813 --> 02:02:03.180
What do you know?
The crud did it.

02:02:05.944 --> 02:02:08.856
I'd like to know what made him do it.

02:02:08.988 --> 02:02:12.321
Maybe he just wanted
to steal our wire cutters.

02:02:12.450 --> 02:02:14.441
You ever think of that?
