01:57.956 --> 01:59.747
All right.

02:01.169 --> 02:02.544
Ready?

02:05.174 --> 02:06.372
So, what's the big surprise?

02:06.550 --> 02:09.966
A whole shelf. lt's all for you.

02:10.973 --> 02:12.348
Well, l'm touched.

02:12.516 --> 02:14.425
Well, you said
you needed more room

02:14.602 --> 02:16.927
and l kind of like the idea
of your books in my locker.

02:17.731 --> 02:21.350
Well, l kind of like the idea
of my books in your locker too.

02:21.528 --> 02:25.063
But moving in together,
that's an awfully big step, isn't it?

02:25.283 --> 02:27.026
l mean,
what would your parents think?

02:27.202 --> 02:29.872
They think l'm nuts anyway.

02:35.796 --> 02:38.204
- Wow, what a week.
- Thank God it's Friday.

02:38.383 --> 02:41.170
- So, what's going on this weekend?
- Nothing.

02:41.345 --> 02:42.625
You wanna go see a movie?

02:42.805 --> 02:45.640
No, anything that's worth seeing,
l've already seen.

02:45.809 --> 02:47.137
How about miniature golf?

02:47.311 --> 02:49.885
Donna, you've been hanging out
with David a little too long.

02:50.065 --> 02:53.399
l thought that once l got my licence the
whole world would be at my disposal.

02:53.569 --> 02:56.321
l think that's after you turn 21 .

02:57.533 --> 03:00.368
- Well, if it isn't the happy couple.
- Hey, ladies.

03:00.537 --> 03:03.242
What are you up to this weekend?
Something disgustingly romantic?

03:03.457 --> 03:05.414
We have no plans.

03:05.585 --> 03:09.535
Actually, l made plans, but
you guys can join us, if you're up to it.

03:09.715 --> 03:11.423
- Well, what did you have in mind?
- This.

03:14.680 --> 03:17.432
- l don't get it. An egg?
- Let me see this.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.640
lt's this incredibly
hip underground club.

03:19.811 --> 03:21.353
lt changes its location every week.

03:21.564 --> 03:22.975
Sounds fun, if you're over 21 .

03:23.149 --> 03:25.308
You don't have to be.
There's no age limit.

03:25.485 --> 03:27.193
The music is great,
the people are cool.

03:27.571 --> 03:29.611
- And anything goes.
- Cool.

03:29.824 --> 03:32.494
lt is. l used to go to these things
all the time in San Francisco.

03:32.661 --> 03:34.120
There's nothing like it.

03:34.539 --> 03:35.950
So where did you get that thing?

03:36.416 --> 03:38.076
Some guy was giving them out
on Melrose.

03:38.252 --> 03:39.830
But this isn't the address of the club.

03:40.004 --> 03:42.080
This is the address where you go
to exchange an egg.

03:42.257 --> 03:44.962
- Exchange an egg?
- You'll see.

03:46.179 --> 03:47.638
So, Brandon, are you gonna go?

03:47.848 --> 03:50.007
Sure, why not?
Sounds like an experience.

03:50.184 --> 03:53.019
Just so long as l don't have to dance.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.971
- So are you in?
- Sure. l...

03:56.150 --> 03:57.525
Definitely. We're in.

03:57.944 --> 03:59.486
Andrea,
you gotta come with us tonight.

03:59.696 --> 04:01.903
We're gonna delve deep
into the seedy underbelly

04:02.074 --> 04:03.948
of the L.A. underground club scene.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.241
ls this an article you're writing
behind my back?

04:06.705 --> 04:09.825
No, actually, we were gonna go
just for fun.

04:10.669 --> 04:13.243
Oh, well, l don't think so.

04:13.422 --> 04:15.331
Come on, Andrea,
you remember fun.

04:15.508 --> 04:18.082
Or is it such a foreign concept
these days?

04:18.262 --> 04:21.548
Hey. What's all this
underground-club business

04:21.724 --> 04:23.266
that's been going down without me?

04:23.435 --> 04:25.262
Steve,
aren't you supposed to be in class?

04:25.479 --> 04:27.519
Not until l find out
what's going on tonight.

04:27.690 --> 04:29.647
Well, be at the Peach Pit at 1 0:30.

04:29.818 --> 04:33.768
And then we are going to go
and exchange this.

04:33.949 --> 04:34.980
l don't get it.

04:35.158 --> 04:37.828
We're supposed to exchange an egg
at a convenience store downtown,

04:37.995 --> 04:40.996
at which point they will then clue us in
to the actual club location.

04:41.166 --> 04:42.957
What's the big secret?

04:43.127 --> 04:45.797
Cops love to bust any place
kids wanna go and have a good time.

04:45.964 --> 04:48.253
Not unless there's something illegal
going on.

04:48.467 --> 04:50.543
Well, l hear
those places are raging babe-fests.

04:50.720 --> 04:55.098
And if that's illegal,
then l'm public enemy number one.

04:55.268 --> 04:58.103
So, Andrea, what about it? You in?

04:58.272 --> 05:00.680
l don't know. No.

05:01.442 --> 05:03.067
l'd understand if you're scared.

05:06.032 --> 05:09.865
Actually, it would be a terrific piece
for the Blaze.

05:10.454 --> 05:13.574
- But...
- Andrea, be my date.

05:15.419 --> 05:17.376
And what about
the raging babe-fest?

05:17.588 --> 05:21.586
Well, this way, they'll think l'm taken
and they'll want me more.

05:22.052 --> 05:27.842
Well, if you guys
aren't gonna write about it, l will.

05:28.060 --> 05:29.851
All right, then, it's settled.

05:32.899 --> 05:34.227
What are you gonna tell your mom?

05:34.401 --> 05:36.394
This thing doesn't get started
until pretty late.

05:36.571 --> 05:40.901
Brenda's mom doesn't worry about her
because she knows she's with me.

05:41.077 --> 05:43.651
l don't know. l guess we're gonna have
to make up something.

05:43.830 --> 05:46.452
- What are you gonna tell your mom?
- The truth.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.618
My mom's got this thing
with lying lately.

05:48.795 --> 05:51.465
So long as l'm straight with her,
she lets me do anything l want.

05:51.632 --> 05:54.384
Wow, Bren, maybe your mom
should have a talk with Kelly's mom.

05:54.552 --> 05:55.880
What do you think?

05:56.054 --> 05:58.925
- lt won't work. Trust me.
- No.

06:00.435 --> 06:03.686
We'll just tell them
that we're gonna be out late studying.

06:03.856 --> 06:06.608
On a Friday night, dressed like this?

06:06.902 --> 06:11.280
Okay, we'll be half-honest
and tell them we're going to a party.

06:11.658 --> 06:14.232
Well, that does have
a kernel of truth to it.

06:14.411 --> 06:16.320
But what if they ask whose party?

06:16.539 --> 06:18.247
We'll make up a name.

06:18.416 --> 06:21.785
- Bran, l hate lying to them.
- Okay, fine, we'll keep it simple, then.

06:21.963 --> 06:24.039
We'll tell them we're going out to
get a bite to eat

06:24.216 --> 06:25.959
and going out to see a movie.

06:26.135 --> 06:29.421
- What movie?
- Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.886
There's a midnight show
every Friday night in Westwood.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.597
Well, that could work.

06:40.153 --> 06:42.312
l hope you're not planning
on breathing tonight.

06:42.531 --> 06:44.571
Yeah,
these are definitely inhale-only.

06:44.951 --> 06:46.576
So where you off to anyway?

06:47.120 --> 06:50.454
Just going out with everybody, Brenda,
Brandon, Donna, Steve, Dylan, Emily--

06:50.625 --> 06:54.706
- Well, l know. But where?
- Honestly?

06:54.880 --> 06:57.881
We're going to an underground club
that Emily knows about.

06:58.593 --> 06:59.755
Wait a second.

06:59.928 --> 07:01.885
l just saw an expose of those clubs
on the news.

07:02.306 --> 07:04.049
- You did?
- Yeah.

07:04.225 --> 07:06.514
They're illegal
and they're in horrible neighbourhoods.

07:06.687 --> 07:09.688
Really? l'll let you know.

07:09.899 --> 07:13.518
Oh, no, you won't. l can't let you go.

07:15.114 --> 07:19.611
l can't believe this. l tell you the truth
and you totally turn it against me.

07:19.829 --> 07:22.664
Kelly, l appreciate your honesty,
but just because you tell the truth

07:22.833 --> 07:25.918
doesn't mean you can go off
and do whatever you want.

07:26.754 --> 07:28.961
There used to be a time
when you were in such a fog

07:29.132 --> 07:32.667
that l could do whatever l wanted
and you wouldn't know the difference.

07:32.887 --> 07:34.298
The good old days.

07:34.598 --> 07:36.887
Mother, l'm gonna be the only one
who's not going.

07:37.226 --> 07:42.352
Well, then you're probably
the only one who told the truth. Sorry.

07:49.283 --> 07:51.572
This is the most
ghoulish conversation.

07:53.914 --> 07:56.239
- We're going out.
- Have fun.

07:56.459 --> 07:58.037
We're just gonna grab a--

08:00.381 --> 08:02.872
We might be home a little late.

08:03.593 --> 08:05.835
Would it be all right
if we're a little late for curfew?

08:06.180 --> 08:07.758
Why? What's going on?

08:08.141 --> 08:11.142
- Oh, this thing.
- Thing, yeah.

08:11.312 --> 08:13.982
- All right, 1 a.m., no later.
- One-thirty, Dad?

08:14.190 --> 08:15.221
All right, 1 :30.

08:15.442 --> 08:18.360
- Two?
- Don't push it, sweetie.

08:18.947 --> 08:20.441
You guys will be together?

08:20.615 --> 08:21.813
- Absolutely.
- Definitely.

08:22.034 --> 08:25.700
- All right, 1 :30. Have fun.
- Drive safely.

08:27.916 --> 08:29.541
Well, this is history in the making.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.034
My daughter's actually studying
on a Friday night.

08:32.214 --> 08:34.421
lt's not like l have any choice.

08:34.717 --> 08:36.840
Good night, sweetheart.

08:37.010 --> 08:39.004
l'm going to Mel's,
but l won't be home too late.

08:39.181 --> 08:41.340
- Well, at least one of us has a life.
- Kelly.

08:41.517 --> 08:43.592
l'm just kidding. Tell Mel l said hi.

08:43.770 --> 08:45.478
- l will.
- Okay.

09:17.981 --> 09:22.608
Brandon,
are you sure you wanna do this?

09:22.779 --> 09:26.279
Yeah, l'm sure. But if you're
feeling any doubts, don't come.

09:26.450 --> 09:31.160
No, it's just that l feel like we're all here
because Emily said so.

09:32.249 --> 09:34.456
You really don't like her, do you?

09:34.794 --> 09:38.210
Brandon, she's your girlfriend.
That's all that matters.

09:38.758 --> 09:41.962
- Brenda, Brandon.
- Hi.

09:43.514 --> 09:46.718
Hey, something up here?

09:46.893 --> 09:48.767
This isn't the Peach Pit attire.

09:48.979 --> 09:52.230
Yeah, we're heading out to
this place.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.318
Yeah? Well, have fun at that place.

09:55.488 --> 09:58.406
And you take care of my pal.
Don't let him get in any trouble.

09:58.617 --> 10:00.942
He's got the early shift tomorrow.

10:03.665 --> 10:05.290
- Everybody ready?
- Yeah.

10:05.459 --> 10:06.918
Where's Steve and Andrea?

10:07.086 --> 10:09.079
- They haven't shown up yet.
- l bet they bailed.

10:09.255 --> 10:11.627
Yeah, l bet they're stuck in traffic
somewhere.

10:11.800 --> 10:13.959
Well, guys, if we don't exchange
that egg by midnight,

10:14.137 --> 10:15.797
we might not get in at all.

10:16.014 --> 10:18.801
Exchange an egg.
That's cool. That's very cool.

10:18.976 --> 10:21.016
l like that.

10:22.564 --> 10:24.806
- What? lt's very cool.
- You look like Johnny Cash.

10:24.984 --> 10:27.522
Donna, why does David have to go
with us everywhere we go?

10:27.696 --> 10:29.819
Kelly, get used to it.

10:40.921 --> 10:42.830
This is it?

10:43.383 --> 10:44.414
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:44.592 --> 10:47.712
l'd like to exchange an egg.

10:48.723 --> 10:52.258
- Ten dollars, please.
- Ten dollars?

10:56.066 --> 10:58.142
- Yes.
- Anything else, please?

10:59.153 --> 11:00.564
l'll have some gum.

11:00.738 --> 11:03.573
- Water.
- Popcorn.

11:03.742 --> 11:06.280
- A bottle of whisky.
- David.

11:09.541 --> 11:14.251
- That's $1 6, please.
- l got it.

11:24.310 --> 11:28.308
This is it? This is the place?

11:30.777 --> 11:32.604
You guys,
can you believe he sold this to me?

11:32.779 --> 11:34.273
He didn't even check my lD.

11:34.448 --> 11:37.568
Would you shut up already, David?
Trust me, nobody even remotely cares.

11:37.744 --> 11:39.535
Well, guys, we're here.

11:39.705 --> 11:42.279
- lt looks kind of creepy.
- Plus, there's not even a bouncer.

11:42.459 --> 11:45.710
Well, they figure if you're crazy enough
to find the place, they'll let you in.

11:45.880 --> 11:48.798
You know, l don't think that
we're too late to still go see a movie.

11:48.967 --> 11:52.419
Oh, we're way past popcorn
and gummy bears now, guys.

11:53.264 --> 11:55.221
l'm in there.

11:55.893 --> 11:58.728
Bren, listen, there's something
Emily didn't tell you about this club.

11:58.896 --> 11:59.927
What?

12:00.106 --> 12:02.977
l mean, people do come for the music
and the dancing and all that,

12:03.152 --> 12:06.985
but some of them just come
for the drugs.

12:07.199 --> 12:08.907
Dylan, are you gonna be okay?

12:09.076 --> 12:11.365
Yeah, yeah. l mean,
just because they're in there,

12:11.538 --> 12:15.038
doesn't mean we have to do them.
All right?

12:15.209 --> 12:18.246
- Okay.
- Come on, let's have fun.

12:29.728 --> 12:32.017
Well, l definitely don't think
we're in Kansas anymore.

12:32.231 --> 12:34.271
l don't even think
we're in L.A. anymore.

12:34.442 --> 12:36.933
And we are definitely not
in Beverly Hills.

12:42.786 --> 12:44.695
Wow, this is trippy.

12:44.872 --> 12:47.624
What's trippy? What are you doing,
Silver, taking acid?

12:47.793 --> 12:49.667
No, it's an expression.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.507
Oh, kind of like ''groovy'' or ''far out''?

12:52.674 --> 12:54.049
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

12:54.218 --> 12:57.753
Yeah, David. You're just so hip,
so happening, right?

12:58.098 --> 13:02.559
So anyone care to join me?

13:02.895 --> 13:06.680
No. You know, David,
you're such a geek.

13:06.859 --> 13:08.935
l don't want you
barfing all over my Beemer, okay?

13:09.112 --> 13:10.654
He's turning into a lush on us.

13:10.822 --> 13:14.026
Kelly, not everyone who has a drink
or two is an alcoholic.

13:14.243 --> 13:15.821
That's right.

13:38.817 --> 13:40.726
You know,
l never thought l'd actually say this,

13:40.903 --> 13:43.774
but l'm starting to feel twinges
of nostalgia for Steve.

13:43.948 --> 13:44.979
l know how you feel.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.741
Life can be really depressing
without a boyfriend.

13:52.376 --> 13:55.496
You know, l hate to say this, because
Brandon likes her and everything,

13:55.672 --> 13:59.006
but there's something about Emily
that just rubs me the wrong way.

13:59.176 --> 14:03.471
Well, she obviously rubs somebody
the right way.

14:20.454 --> 14:23.159
- Damn it.
- l guess everybody's gone.

14:23.332 --> 14:25.455
Well, what'd you expect, Andrea?

14:25.627 --> 14:27.454
Your grandmother held us hostage
for an hour,

14:27.630 --> 14:29.504
telling us stories
about challah and Pesach.

14:29.674 --> 14:31.999
That's because you asked for seconds
on the chopped liver.

14:32.177 --> 14:35.629
Hey, the chopped liver was good.
l can't believe they blew us off though.

14:35.807 --> 14:38.215
lt's about time you showed up.
l have a message for you.

14:38.435 --> 14:41.887
- Good. Did they say where they went?
- Better. She drew a map.

14:42.065 --> 14:43.690
Who did?

14:44.276 --> 14:46.316
Brandon's girlfriend?

14:46.863 --> 14:50.067
- They said to give you this.
- An egg?

14:50.242 --> 14:51.404
Andrea, get with the drill.

14:51.577 --> 14:53.866
You go to this address
and you ask to exchange that.

14:54.039 --> 14:55.201
That's ridiculous.

14:55.415 --> 14:57.408
Sweetheart, l couldn't have said it
better myself.

14:57.585 --> 14:58.664
Both of you, go, go, go.

14:58.878 --> 15:01.630
Thanks, Nat. But do you know
where Alvarado Street is?

15:02.633 --> 15:04.875
- l'll get it, l'll get it, just go.
- l'm sorry.

15:05.053 --> 15:06.927
- l'll get it.
- You've gotta be kidding me.

15:07.097 --> 15:08.508
l'm sorry, l didn't mean to do it.

15:16.985 --> 15:20.401
l'll do anything you want, just so long
as you don't make me dance, okay?

15:20.573 --> 15:23.360
- l'll wash your car.
- l don't have one.

15:23.535 --> 15:24.863
l'll buy one for you and wash it.

15:25.037 --> 15:27.362
l'll let you have the marshmallows
out of my Lucky Charms.

15:27.540 --> 15:29.082
l'll change your cat litter, anything.

15:29.251 --> 15:31.921
Just so long as l never,
ever have to dance again.

15:32.088 --> 15:35.173
Well, haven't you heard?
Dancing is the key to popularity.

15:35.342 --> 15:36.587
What about that guy over there?

15:36.760 --> 15:38.967
He's not dancing,
he's the most popular guy here.

15:39.180 --> 15:40.425
Don't stare.

15:40.598 --> 15:43.172
l'm not. Why? You know him?

15:43.477 --> 15:46.229
You see the 4 on his shirt?
He sells Euphoria.

15:47.107 --> 15:49.479
What, the mood or the drug?

15:49.777 --> 15:51.271
What do you think?

15:51.446 --> 15:55.444
What, he sells it right here, out in the
open, in front of God and everybody?

15:55.618 --> 15:58.987
Sure. Twenty-five bucks a hit.

15:59.164 --> 16:01.869
lt's supposed to be worth it too.
You've never done it, huh?

16:02.043 --> 16:03.917
No, have you?

16:04.087 --> 16:06.163
lt's supposed to really get rid
of your inhibitions.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.712
Well, l like my inhibitions.
l'm used to them.

16:08.885 --> 16:12.634
Hey, you guys. Sitting here,
soaking up the atmosphere?

16:12.807 --> 16:17.470
The atmosphere? l think this place is
the hole in the ozone layer. But l like it.

16:17.646 --> 16:21.514
Check out Rico Suave over there.

16:24.155 --> 16:26.112
Have l infiltrated couples' corner?

16:26.324 --> 16:29.029
- No, Kel, sit down.
- l feel like a fifth wheel.

16:29.203 --> 16:31.955
Now, Kelly, it's okay to be single.

16:32.123 --> 16:33.368
Yeah, right.

16:33.583 --> 16:35.410
Anyway, there's tons of guys here.

16:35.628 --> 16:39.329
Yeah, l mean, check out that guy
over there. He's pretty buff.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.340
Brenda, you can see his nipples.

16:42.512 --> 16:44.754
Maybe we ought to get us
some of them fishnet shirts.

16:44.931 --> 16:46.556
They seem pretty popular.

16:46.725 --> 16:49.477
No, actually, l've got my eye
on this rubber jumpsuit l saw earlier.

16:49.687 --> 16:50.718
lt's a pretty hot item.

16:50.897 --> 16:53.353
- Hey, he's not bad.
- Which one?

16:53.526 --> 16:55.898
The guy over there
with the 4 on his shirt.

16:56.071 --> 16:59.072
Kelly, he's a drug dealer.

16:59.241 --> 17:00.949
Oh, and how would you know,
Brandon?

17:01.912 --> 17:03.821
l'm a journalist. lt's my job.

17:04.039 --> 17:07.205
Oh, really? ls Jimmy Olsen
now investigating the drug scene?

17:07.377 --> 17:09.618
Brenda, l know what's happening.

17:09.797 --> 17:12.882
Oh, my God.
l think l see Kerry Gainer.

17:13.050 --> 17:14.082
Who?

17:14.261 --> 17:16.135
One of my best friends
from San Francisco.

17:16.305 --> 17:18.630
Excuse me. l'll be back.

17:19.893 --> 17:21.636
Em, Em, come on, boogie down.

17:21.811 --> 17:25.063
l don't think so.
l'm not into threesomes.

17:38.041 --> 17:40.200
At least you could have spilled decaf.
lt's lighter.

17:40.419 --> 17:41.961
-lt is not.
- lt is too.

17:42.130 --> 17:44.752
Not. Will you stop?
This is ridiculous. Stop worrying.

17:44.925 --> 17:47.463
l'm sure we're going the right way.
l mean, reasonably sure.

17:47.637 --> 17:50.342
l mean, it's likely that we're
in the right vicinity, more or less.

17:50.516 --> 17:53.138
Andrea, why don't you just admit
that you can't read that thing?

17:53.311 --> 17:55.933
We're totally lost,
totally in the middle of nowhere.

17:56.106 --> 17:58.858
- None of this would have happened--
- All right. Just stop!

17:59.068 --> 18:00.942
Sorry. l get a little excited.
l'm frustrated.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.987
- What do you want from me?
- No, stop the car.

18:03.157 --> 18:05.364
l think that's
the convenience store right over there.

18:08.122 --> 18:10.957
Hi. l'd like to exchange an egg.

18:11.751 --> 18:15.251
You wanna exchange an egg?
Do you have a receipt?

18:15.423 --> 18:20.169
No. Do l need a receipt?
l mean, is that part of the thing?

18:20.346 --> 18:23.762
lt's customary to have a receipt
when you wanna exchange something.

18:23.976 --> 18:25.470
l think we're in the wrong place.

18:25.644 --> 18:28.515
No, no, this is all part of the deal.

18:29.483 --> 18:33.813
l want to exchange an egg.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.942
- Steve, let's go.
- What's wrong with the egg?

18:37.910 --> 18:39.784
- Nothing.
- But you want another?

18:40.288 --> 18:42.577
No, l don't want another egg.
l want information.

18:43.125 --> 18:45.747
Look, l don't know
what you kids are on,

18:46.379 --> 18:48.419
but l'm calling the police.

18:48.591 --> 18:51.165
You know,
l think we're in the wrong place.

19:00.231 --> 19:02.438
Hey, l was beginning to think
you had ditched me.

19:02.609 --> 19:05.231
- Never.
- How's your friend?

19:05.404 --> 19:07.397
Well, it wasn't her,
but l ran into somebody else

19:07.573 --> 19:10.610
and l got something special for you
and for me.

19:10.786 --> 19:12.066
What?

19:12.246 --> 19:14.998
lt's for you and for me.

19:15.166 --> 19:17.538
Well, give me a clue.

19:17.878 --> 19:20.334
l'll just give this to you.

19:22.217 --> 19:25.302
- l don't think so, Em.
- Please?

19:25.471 --> 19:28.840
- l told you, l don't do drugs.
- Neither do l,

19:29.018 --> 19:32.138
but everybody says it's the best way
to bring a new couple closer.

19:32.313 --> 19:33.688
lt's a love drug, babe.

19:33.857 --> 19:37.273
- Aren't you the least bit curious?
- Yes, l'm curious about a lot of things.

19:37.445 --> 19:39.153
l'm curious how l'm gonna look
when l'm 70.

19:39.323 --> 19:43.108
l'm curious if dogs really smile.
l'm curious why l have to study trig.

19:43.578 --> 19:45.369
And you're not curious
about the human mind?

19:45.581 --> 19:48.915
lt doesn't matter if l am or not.
l have no tolerance for chemicals.

19:49.085 --> 19:50.663
l've tried drinking, l totalled my car.

19:50.837 --> 19:53.375
You know, l try this,
what's gonna happen?

19:53.549 --> 19:56.883
Okay, Mr. Perfect,
Mr. Squeaky Clean.

19:57.054 --> 20:00.589
- Emily, come on--
- No, it's okay.

20:01.434 --> 20:03.925
But isn't there any way
we can satisfy that curiosity?

20:04.981 --> 20:06.808
Sure, if some poltergeist
broke into my house

20:06.983 --> 20:09.355
in the middle of the night
and slipped it under my tongue--

20:09.528 --> 20:12.399
- Okay, okay, l get the picture.
- All right.

20:12.574 --> 20:15.065
Heigh-ho, Brand-o!

20:15.703 --> 20:18.823
Would you care for some
of my refreshing refreshment?

20:19.040 --> 20:21.531
Boy, did you pick the wrong guy.

20:22.253 --> 20:24.875
- l'll get you a soda.
- Get out of here.

20:28.135 --> 20:30.922
- Hi.
- How you doing, Silver?

20:31.098 --> 20:36.010
Good. l'm just the... l'm the...

20:36.187 --> 20:39.224
- You're the host who's had the most.
- The host who's had the most, right.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.105
l believe that. l believe that.

20:42.404 --> 20:46.189
What?
What's wrong, don't you like me?

20:47.243 --> 20:53.912
You know what? She likes me.
Donna, she likes me.

21:09.814 --> 21:12.436
Donna, Donna. l told you
we shouldn't have brought him.

21:12.609 --> 21:15.361
Oh, he's just having fun.

21:58.377 --> 22:00.204
Thank you.

22:00.588 --> 22:03.423
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

22:35.174 --> 22:36.965
Can l ask you a question?

22:37.135 --> 22:40.339
You know those bumps on top
of your tongue? What are they called?

22:40.514 --> 22:43.848
- Those are your taste buds.
- Oh, yeah.

22:44.478 --> 22:47.645
You know, Em, l feel really good.
l feel really alive.

22:47.815 --> 22:49.808
Yeah, l know.

23:00.456 --> 23:02.745
Was that a kiss? What was that?

23:02.918 --> 23:04.958
Feeling a little euphoric?

23:05.129 --> 23:10.041
- Something like that.
- No, you feel euphoric.

23:11.679 --> 23:13.257
l love you. l knew you'd get off on it.

23:13.432 --> 23:16.932
Whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
What's going on here?

23:17.103 --> 23:19.392
You're opening your doors
of perception.

23:19.564 --> 23:22.316
No. No, Emily.
l told you l didn't wanna do drugs.

23:22.485 --> 23:24.525
You said you'd try it
if someone slipped it to you.

23:24.696 --> 23:27.104
Yeah, but l didn't mean it like that.

23:27.533 --> 23:29.858
Well, what's done is done, babe.

23:30.036 --> 23:34.284
You might as well relax, kick back
and wait for the magic to happen.

23:37.379 --> 23:39.751
l just don't wanna flip out.

23:40.091 --> 23:42.629
Well, l won't let you.

23:42.803 --> 23:44.630
Trust me.

24:04.622 --> 24:05.950
Are you sure this says Alvarado?

24:06.124 --> 24:08.247
l don't know.
l'm not up on my hieroglyphics.

24:08.419 --> 24:11.290
You know, Emily could have
drawn us a better map.

24:11.465 --> 24:13.956
There was nothing wrong with her map
until you spilled coffee.

24:14.135 --> 24:16.673
She could have drawn on something
more permanent than a napkin.

24:16.846 --> 24:18.506
l'm sure she went
for whatever was around.

24:18.682 --> 24:21.683
Oh, that's definitely
how she operates.

24:23.856 --> 24:25.350
Please, l don't wanna be catty,
okay?

24:25.524 --> 24:27.896
But it is obvious that the only reason
she joined the paper

24:28.069 --> 24:29.729
was so she could put the moves
on Brandon.

24:29.905 --> 24:32.823
She never gets her stories in on time.
They always have to be worked on.

24:32.992 --> 24:34.819
lt's one thing after another--

24:34.995 --> 24:37.118
Shut up.

24:42.087 --> 24:45.005
Oh, God, David,
l gotta sit down. l'm bushed.

24:45.175 --> 24:48.010
Which one? George or Barbara?

24:49.222 --> 24:52.223
You get it?
George and Barbara Bush.

24:52.517 --> 24:55.222
What's the matter?
Don't you like me?

24:55.730 --> 24:59.016
You know who likes me?
Brenda likes me, huh, Brenda?

24:59.193 --> 25:01.269
Yeah, when you're sober.

25:01.446 --> 25:04.815
You think l'm drunk?
She thinks l'm drunk.

25:04.992 --> 25:07.697
Well, dude, you are drunk.

25:08.163 --> 25:11.034
Okay, well, fine.
lf everybody thinks l'm drunk,

25:11.208 --> 25:13.450
then l might as well
just have another drink.

25:13.628 --> 25:17.080
- Any takers?
- Get that out of my face, all right?

25:17.258 --> 25:19.417
Forty-five minutes
until you turn into a pumpkin.

25:19.594 --> 25:22.631
- Oh, my God. Dylan, we gotta go.
- All right, let's go.

25:23.390 --> 25:25.632
Wait, l gotta go.

25:42.415 --> 25:44.408
You think this place
even has a bathroom?

25:44.584 --> 25:48.914
- l don't know, this place is very weird.
- Yeah, definitely not my scene.

25:49.090 --> 25:52.008
- Oh, my God. Kelly, check it out.
- What?

25:52.178 --> 25:55.132
My brother is dancing.

25:58.978 --> 26:02.597
Well, give the girl some credit.
She finally got him to loosen up.

26:05.653 --> 26:07.147
Come on, let's go outside.

26:07.322 --> 26:09.149
- Come on, lets go.
- Okay.

26:13.705 --> 26:17.454
Enjoy it, Brandon. The first time
you get a rush is always the best.

26:17.710 --> 26:20.497
l thought you said
you never did it before.

26:28.307 --> 26:29.718
All right, maybe you're right.

26:29.893 --> 26:31.636
lf we had started
a couple of hours earlier,

26:31.812 --> 26:33.390
if we hadn't mutilated
the instructions.

26:33.564 --> 26:36.269
But as far as l'm concerned,
this evening has been a total:

26:36.443 --> 26:39.694
How could you say that?
This has been a dream date for me.

26:39.864 --> 26:41.406
Didn't anyone tell you?

26:42.117 --> 26:43.991
Pardon me.
l've gotta see a man about an egg.

26:44.161 --> 26:45.275
Please, let's just go home.

26:45.496 --> 26:46.776
- Forget it.
- Steve, please.

26:46.998 --> 26:48.576
What about
your prize-winning expose?

26:48.750 --> 26:51.420
l think l can live without never
seeing an underground club, okay?

26:51.587 --> 26:54.374
Well, could you live without seeing
Brandon and Emily together?

26:55.968 --> 26:59.053
Steve, how about we just
take me home anytime now, all right?

26:59.264 --> 27:01.553
Fine. You wanna roll over,
play dead, sure.

27:01.892 --> 27:03.683
What am l supposed to do?

27:03.853 --> 27:05.431
l mean,
you see the way he looks at her.

27:05.647 --> 27:07.936
That's because
she's always in his face.

27:08.109 --> 27:10.683
What you've gotta do is
stop apologizing for who you are

27:10.862 --> 27:12.273
and get in the game.

27:14.075 --> 27:16.282
- Steve.
- What?

27:16.453 --> 27:22.077
l just saw a guy with spiked hair
go into that store carrying an egg.

27:27.676 --> 27:30.381
On a scale of one to ten,
ten being the grungiest,

27:30.554 --> 27:32.463
have you ever seen a bathroom
as grungy as that?

27:32.640 --> 27:34.716
Well, yes, once.

27:34.893 --> 27:39.188
ln fifth grade, when we had to--
Excuse me. --visit a chicken farm.

27:39.357 --> 27:41.433
A chicken farm?

27:41.610 --> 27:43.935
Yes, a chicken farm.

27:44.739 --> 27:46.779
What is this?

27:53.334 --> 27:56.252
- Dylan, where's Brandon?
- l don't know.

27:56.421 --> 27:58.544
We wanna leave.
This place is never again.

27:58.715 --> 28:01.420
l know you're in a hurry, but
l'm not leaving here without Brandon.

28:01.594 --> 28:03.421
Fine. Go find him.
l'm gonna go get some air.

28:03.597 --> 28:05.839
- Kelly, wait up.
- Bren, what is the matter with her?

28:06.017 --> 28:08.852
Look, people are smoking crack,
okay? This place is horrible.

28:09.020 --> 28:12.436
All right. Look, go wait outside.
l'll find him.

28:15.571 --> 28:17.778
All right, guys. All aboard.
Train's leaving, let's go.

28:17.949 --> 28:20.867
- ln the nick of time.
- Have you seen Brandon?

28:21.036 --> 28:23.706
Let me ask you guys one question.

28:24.123 --> 28:27.077
How do they get the room
to spin like this?

28:28.504 --> 28:29.535
Come on, man.

28:33.218 --> 28:36.255
- Oh, wait.
- Well, go.

28:38.976 --> 28:42.761
- ls he going to make it?
- No.

28:42.939 --> 28:45.181
Oh, God. You know,
we're never gonna make our curfew.

28:45.359 --> 28:47.731
Well, look,
we found Brandon though.

28:48.780 --> 28:50.654
All right, dude!

28:50.824 --> 28:55.321
Look at that. Party!

28:57.416 --> 29:00.868
Maybe not. Come on.

29:03.048 --> 29:07.093
That's it, man. Get it all out.
Whoa, pizza.

29:07.262 --> 29:09.836
- l'm gonna die.
- You're not gonna die, man.

29:10.016 --> 29:13.765
l swear, you're not gonna die. You'll
probably live to be this stupid again.

29:14.897 --> 29:17.056
Guys, my mom's gonna kill me
if l don't beat her home.

29:17.233 --> 29:18.608
She's gonna ground me forever.

29:18.777 --> 29:20.900
Well, then, Kelly, just go.
We'll be all right.

29:21.072 --> 29:23.065
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

29:23.241 --> 29:24.783
l'll call you tomorrow.
Come on, Donna.

29:24.993 --> 29:26.404
No, we can't leave David, Kelly.

29:29.541 --> 29:31.617
There you go, Greeko Suave.

29:31.794 --> 29:34.250
Put his head over the side, please.

29:34.422 --> 29:36.878
Remind me to do this more often.

29:40.430 --> 29:41.461
Bye.

29:41.640 --> 29:43.431
- Drive safe, Kel.
- We will.

29:46.563 --> 29:50.977
All right, let's go get Brandon,
before we miss our curfew.

29:56.492 --> 29:58.532
What are you doing?
lt's almost 1 in the morning.

29:58.703 --> 30:00.660
Actually, it's past 1 in the morning.

30:00.831 --> 30:02.705
l don't know. What are we doing?

30:02.875 --> 30:06.743
l don't know,
but l don't think we're done yet.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.834
Emily's in a very good mood.

30:10.051 --> 30:13.670
- Brandon, are you on something?
- What?

30:13.890 --> 30:15.432
Yeah, the hood of my car,
same as you.

30:17.269 --> 30:21.564
Where did you get that little scar
on your eyebrows? lt's so cute.

30:21.733 --> 30:23.013
l don't believe this.

30:23.193 --> 30:26.313
- Well, hey, Bren, relax. l feel great.
- You feel stoned, man.

30:26.531 --> 30:27.859
Well, you're the expert.

30:28.325 --> 30:31.445
And l mean that in a good way. You
handle your alcohol thing real good.

30:31.621 --> 30:34.456
- Shut up, man.
- So negative, really, man.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.825
- Crashed my buzz.
- Bad vibes, you guys.

30:37.003 --> 30:40.538
- l feel really bad for you.
- Thanks for your sympathy, Emily.

30:40.757 --> 30:42.584
Why don't you guys
just give me the car keys?

30:42.760 --> 30:44.919
l'm not gonna let you
drive yourselves home.

30:45.138 --> 30:46.549
No, Bren, l can't do that,

30:46.723 --> 30:49.641
because, number one,
l'm not ready to leave yet.

30:49.811 --> 30:51.638
And number two,

30:51.855 --> 30:55.604
no offence, but l've seen you drive
and it's not a pretty sight.

30:55.777 --> 30:58.233
Give. Give them.

30:58.405 --> 31:01.157
Here, man, 40 bucks.
Jones, get in a cab.

31:01.326 --> 31:03.319
All right, Dylan.

31:03.829 --> 31:05.407
Cabbage.

31:08.877 --> 31:10.917
Dylan, we can't just leave them.

31:11.088 --> 31:13.081
What if he gets in trouble?
What if he gets hurt?

31:13.258 --> 31:14.752
- Brenda.
- What if he hurts himself?

31:14.926 --> 31:17.251
You don't get it, do you?
He doesn't care. Not right now.

31:17.430 --> 31:19.589
Look at him. He's so high,
he's king of the mountain.

31:19.766 --> 31:21.557
He's got a girl, everything's fine.

31:21.727 --> 31:24.265
Until tomorrow,
when he wakes up feeling like hell

31:24.439 --> 31:27.274
and he'll see
what an ass he made of himself.

31:27.901 --> 31:29.229
You know, l always thought that

31:29.403 --> 31:32.190
if someone would be tempted
to get stoned, it would be you.

31:32.366 --> 31:35.403
Well, l get tempted every day.

31:35.578 --> 31:37.286
Come on.

31:37.664 --> 31:41.497
Oh, hey, hey, hey.
Come on, guys, don't go away mad!

31:41.669 --> 31:43.460
Just go away.

31:45.507 --> 31:48.841
Come on. Come on, lady.

31:49.012 --> 31:51.682
There's no traffic and l get stuck
behind Grandma Moses.

31:51.849 --> 31:54.720
Kelly, your mom
has never been on time in her life.

31:54.895 --> 31:56.722
Don't forget,
l have to drop off your friend.

31:56.897 --> 31:59.139
His mom's house is on the way.

31:59.859 --> 32:02.529
- lt smells like puke in here.
- l don't feel so good.

32:03.322 --> 32:05.113
He is so foul.

32:05.283 --> 32:08.284
- Okay, he made a mistake.
- No, you made a mistake.

32:08.454 --> 32:10.328
He's a dork, a puke-meister.

32:11.666 --> 32:14.453
Yeah, but he's a good dancer.

32:14.712 --> 32:16.835
l'm gonna be grounded for a month
and you know that.

32:17.006 --> 32:19.129
No, l'm not gonna listen to this.
This is silly.

32:19.301 --> 32:21.792
We're gonna be home way
before she will and you know it.

32:22.305 --> 32:24.179
See, l told you
your mom wouldn't be home.

32:28.104 --> 32:29.847
Hi.

32:43.958 --> 32:46.200
ls this what they mean
by being fashionably late?

32:46.378 --> 32:48.454
Hey, this is when the hippest
of the hip arrive.

32:48.630 --> 32:50.919
Don't be a party pooper.

32:52.218 --> 32:54.709
Actually, l think l've had enough
hipness for one evening.

32:54.888 --> 32:56.881
- Andrea, where are you going?
- l'm going inside.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.885
There might be
a major story breaking.

32:59.060 --> 33:00.887
Are you crazy?
Hey, l don't wanna get busted.

33:01.063 --> 33:03.601
What are they gonna bust you for?
Concealing a hard-boiled egg?

33:03.775 --> 33:05.234
Let's go.

33:05.485 --> 33:08.570
Hey, hey, hey, l know you guys.

33:08.781 --> 33:10.857
What are you doing out here?
Where's everybody else?

33:11.034 --> 33:15.246
Oh, God, you guys look great.
l missed you guys.

33:15.415 --> 33:17.123
- l missed--
-What's wrong? You look awful.

33:17.292 --> 33:20.958
- Hey, come on, give me a little kiss.
- Stop it. What's wrong with you?

33:21.131 --> 33:23.966
Where's Kelly
and the other girls? lnside?

33:24.134 --> 33:25.676
- l don't know.
- What do you mean?

33:25.887 --> 33:29.636
- They took off, remember?
- Oh, yeah.

33:32.437 --> 33:34.928
lt's a bust. We've gotta get out of here.
We have to get out!

33:35.107 --> 33:38.192
- l gotta get my-- Where are my keys?
- Hey, hey.

33:38.361 --> 33:40.568
No, no,
they must've fallen on the floor.

33:40.781 --> 33:42.441
Brandon, we don't have time.
We gotta go.

33:42.617 --> 33:46.485
- No, just let me look.
- Look, Brandon, l still have stuff.

33:46.997 --> 33:50.995
- You better get rid of that, real quick.
- l paid 50 bucks for this stuff.

33:51.169 --> 33:53.577
Easy come, easy go.

33:53.756 --> 33:55.464
You can tell that to the cops.

33:55.633 --> 33:56.664
- Let's go.
- Come on.

33:56.843 --> 34:00.888
Andrea, Andrea.
Have you ever done Euphoria?

34:01.057 --> 34:04.224
l can't believe this. Who are you?

34:05.187 --> 34:07.512
What did l say?

34:07.691 --> 34:09.850
Hey, what's that?

34:24.920 --> 34:26.201
Brandon.

34:26.380 --> 34:29.797
Brenda, what are you doing up?
lt's almost 6 in the morning.

34:30.011 --> 34:31.802
Waiting up for you.

34:31.972 --> 34:35.472
Every time l heard a car drive by,
l'd run to the window.

34:36.728 --> 34:40.643
Come on, don't stare at me like that.
l feel like hell.

34:45.322 --> 34:47.030
Brandon,

34:49.453 --> 34:53.154
Mom and Dad trusted us
and you totally violated that.

34:53.333 --> 34:56.204
Brenda, l don't need a lecture,
okay?

34:59.466 --> 35:00.545
Did you tell them anything?

35:01.593 --> 35:03.087
Oh, sure,
l woke them up to tell them

35:03.262 --> 35:05.967
that you were too high on drugs
to come home.

35:07.976 --> 35:09.304
Brandon, how could you do that?

35:09.520 --> 35:12.806
ls Emily so important to you that
you'd do anything for her?

35:12.983 --> 35:14.643
No. She slipped me the drug, Bren.

35:14.860 --> 35:18.064
- Come on, Brandon, that's a cop-out.
- She did.

35:19.450 --> 35:20.778
She slipped Euphoria in my drink

35:20.952 --> 35:23.075
after l told her
l wasn't interested in doing any.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.495
But you looked
like you were so into it.

35:25.666 --> 35:27.326
l mean,
didn't you just wanna kill her?

35:27.502 --> 35:30.456
l tried to get angry,
but it was too late.

35:32.633 --> 35:34.792
l totally lost control.

35:37.264 --> 35:42.888
l could see it happening to myself,
but at the time, l just didn't care.

35:43.063 --> 35:44.438
lt wasn't you, Brandon.

35:46.067 --> 35:49.271
People talk about drugs
like they're so cool,

35:50.656 --> 35:53.361
but they're just this big fake-out.

35:55.496 --> 35:56.907
They take away your real emotions

35:57.081 --> 36:00.616
just long enough until you think
the chemical ones are real.

36:04.174 --> 36:08.042
l thought l was having
these great revelations, you know?

36:09.639 --> 36:15.227
But now that l look back on it,
nothing made sense.

36:15.397 --> 36:17.888
l'm just glad that you're home
and that you're okay.

36:18.818 --> 36:21.819
You know, what l was scared about
more than anything

36:23.157 --> 36:24.735
is that l thought
that you had changed.

36:26.578 --> 36:32.036
No. l'm still my same old boring self.

36:33.003 --> 36:34.996
Only now l feel awful.

36:35.172 --> 36:40.049
Oh, God.
l gotta be at the Pit in an hour.

36:40.554 --> 36:44.089
Will you call Dylan for me, see if he'll
come get me to go pick up my car?

36:44.267 --> 36:46.224
l can take you.

36:46.645 --> 36:50.643
No, l think you'd better stay here
in case Mom and Dad wake up.

37:23.317 --> 37:26.936
Oh, man. l knew l shouldn't have left
my car here last night.

37:27.114 --> 37:28.941
- Well, dude, you couldn't--
- Dylan, please.

37:29.117 --> 37:32.154
Don't lecture me
on the evils of drugs, okay?

37:32.329 --> 37:34.238
l don't have to.

37:35.208 --> 37:38.459
l'm just glad
you didn't see yourself last night.

37:39.421 --> 37:41.295
That bad, huh?

37:42.217 --> 37:44.257
Yeah, but l can't believe
she would do that to you.

37:44.428 --> 37:46.219
l mean, that's cold.

37:46.848 --> 37:49.802
She said she thought
it would bring us closer together.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.429
Did it?

37:53.022 --> 37:58.693
Dylan, man, it tore us apart.

38:02.243 --> 38:09.540
So, what are you gonna tell Jimbo
about the 'Stang?

38:11.338 --> 38:14.173
There's no lie
big enough to cover this one.

38:15.551 --> 38:17.793
l'll have to tell him the truth.

38:25.773 --> 38:30.566
Brandon, what were you doing
downtown at 2 in the morning?

38:30.779 --> 38:33.021
l told you, Dad.
We went to this club.

38:33.199 --> 38:35.986
l thought you kids said
you were going to a movie.

38:36.161 --> 38:38.617
- The plans changed.
- l'll say they did.

38:38.790 --> 38:41.328
A lot of things are gonna change
around here after last night.

38:41.543 --> 38:44.081
What were you doing down there
in the first place?

38:44.255 --> 38:45.583
Well, everybody was going.

38:45.799 --> 38:47.341
And you think that makes it all right?

38:47.551 --> 38:49.425
Why'd you have to leave the car
downtown?

38:52.182 --> 38:56.928
Things got a little crazy.
l guess l was too out of it to drive.

38:57.564 --> 39:00.186
- Tell me you weren't drinking.
- l wasn't drinking, l swear.

39:00.901 --> 39:01.932
Well, what then?

39:08.912 --> 39:10.905
Someone put some Euphoria
in my drink.

39:11.081 --> 39:13.204
Euphoria? What's Euphoria?

39:14.753 --> 39:16.128
lt's this drug.

39:16.630 --> 39:18.373
Oh, my God.

39:18.591 --> 39:20.251
Brandon, we weren't born yesterday.

39:20.426 --> 39:23.048
l don't believe that
anybody slipped you anything.

39:23.222 --> 39:24.597
Dad, give me a little credit here.

39:24.765 --> 39:27.719
l may do a lot of idiotic things,
but taking drugs is not one of them.

39:27.936 --> 39:29.976
Brandon,
do you realise how serious this is?

39:30.147 --> 39:31.807
l mean, that stuff
could have been lethal

39:31.983 --> 39:34.190
or lead to some sort of psychosis.

39:34.361 --> 39:37.777
- Let's not go overboard, Mom, okay?
- l'm not.

39:37.949 --> 39:40.191
There were plenty of drugs around
when l was in college.

39:40.369 --> 39:41.744
l've seen a few casualties myself.

39:42.497 --> 39:45.332
Well, l'm fine now, thanks,

39:45.500 --> 39:47.540
except for the worst headache
known to man.

39:47.712 --> 39:51.247
Well, if you didn't take it,
l'd like to know who did this to you.

39:57.182 --> 39:59.756
lt could have been anyone.
l really have no idea.

39:59.936 --> 40:01.098
l'll get it.

40:07.028 --> 40:09.187
What are you doing here?

40:09.782 --> 40:12.404
Look, Brenda,
there's no reason to be upset with me.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.486
Did you see
Brandon's car out there?

40:14.663 --> 40:18.578
Yeah, and l feel terrible.
Where is Brandon?

40:18.752 --> 40:22.620
ln the kitchen,
though l doubt he'll want to see you.

40:23.758 --> 40:25.501
We'll see.

40:32.644 --> 40:34.387
Brandon, your car.

40:34.564 --> 40:37.435
- l can't believe it.
- Me either.

40:37.609 --> 40:40.813
- Emily, what happened last night?
- What do you mean?

40:41.197 --> 40:44.151
Well, Brandon tells us
that someone slipped him drugs.

40:44.326 --> 40:46.153
Yeah, poor Brandon.
He was high as a kite.

40:46.329 --> 40:48.322
l had to spend all last night
just reeling him in.

40:48.540 --> 40:50.082
Why didn't you
drive him home, Em?

40:50.292 --> 40:52.166
You took his keys
when he threatened to drive.

40:52.336 --> 40:53.415
Don't you remember, Brenda?

40:53.588 --> 40:55.248
And then you disappeared
with Dylan.

40:55.466 --> 40:57.755
You left him alone there last night,
Brenda?

40:57.969 --> 40:59.760
Dad, she knew
Emily was taking care of me.

41:01.515 --> 41:02.677
lf it's all the same to you,

41:02.850 --> 41:05.520
this whole experience is a nightmare
l'd just rather forget, okay?

41:05.729 --> 41:07.271
That may not be so easy.

41:07.481 --> 41:09.355
l know, Dad.

41:09.942 --> 41:12.480
Don't worry, l'll pay for everything.

41:12.654 --> 41:13.852
That's what my life is about,

41:14.031 --> 41:17.864
working my butt off to pay
for the damage l inflict on my car.

41:18.036 --> 41:20.527
Now, if you'll all excuse me,
l have to get changed for work.

41:20.706 --> 41:24.040
Honey,
are you sure you're all right?

41:24.419 --> 41:26.127
Maybe we should call a doctor
or something.

41:26.297 --> 41:29.251
Mom, l'm fine.

41:34.140 --> 41:35.551
Poor guy.

41:36.518 --> 41:39.389
Maybe l should go talk to him,
he seems so upset.

41:47.157 --> 41:48.948
Bad headache?

41:51.162 --> 41:52.740
Yeah.

41:56.753 --> 42:00.288
Emily, Emily, you can't--
You can't fix it like that.

42:00.466 --> 42:02.044
Come on,
you had a good time last night.

42:02.218 --> 42:04.792
Yeah, but l told you l wasn't into it.

42:04.972 --> 42:07.759
How could you mess with my mind
like that?

42:08.226 --> 42:10.302
l was just trying to loosen you up.
l'm sorry.

42:10.479 --> 42:12.306
l had no idea
you'd get so bent out of shape.

42:12.481 --> 42:14.308
How am l ever
supposed to trust you again?

42:14.484 --> 42:16.393
You tell me that.

42:16.570 --> 42:18.527
First you tell me
you haven't done Euphoria,

42:18.698 --> 42:20.774
then you tell me you have.
What's the truth?

42:22.411 --> 42:23.573
Look, Brandon, l just thought

42:23.746 --> 42:26.118
doing Euphoria would
bring us closer together.

42:26.458 --> 42:28.617
Well, you thought wrong, all right?

42:30.713 --> 42:32.706
You bought some strange drug
from some strange guy

42:32.883 --> 42:33.962
and slipped it in my drink.

42:34.802 --> 42:37.210
All you got out of me
was a chemical reaction, that's it.

42:37.388 --> 42:41.636
l'm sorry, for everything.
l'll pay for your car.

42:41.852 --> 42:43.132
l don't want your money, Emily.

42:48.528 --> 42:52.313
ln fact,
l don't want anything to do with you.

42:53.409 --> 42:54.654
Can't l make a mistake?

42:55.370 --> 42:57.197
Not everyone's as perfect as you are,
Brandon.

42:57.372 --> 43:00.124
l'm not perfect. l'm just honest.

43:00.668 --> 43:03.872
When l told you
l didn't wanna do Euphoria, l meant it.

43:04.256 --> 43:07.875
- Next time, l'll know.
- There isn't gonna be a next time.

43:10.431 --> 43:12.507
l just need some space, all right?

43:13.351 --> 43:16.186
l need some time to sort all this out.

43:16.355 --> 43:18.763
- How long?
- As long as it takes.

43:20.444 --> 43:23.066
Do you remember the stuff
you said to me last night, Brandon?

43:23.239 --> 43:25.695
Let me refresh your memory.
You said:

43:26.744 --> 43:30.825
''l have never had such intense
feelings for any girl in my life.''

43:34.837 --> 43:37.507
Yeah, well,
l must have been on drugs.

43:46.686 --> 43:49.260
Hey. l'm glad you're here.

43:49.440 --> 43:51.065
Yeah, me too.

43:51.233 --> 43:53.226
l was really--
l was really worried about you--

43:53.403 --> 43:56.073
Hey, l'm sorry
you had to see me like that last night.

43:56.240 --> 43:57.983
That wasn't you.

43:58.326 --> 44:01.577
Andrea, you have no idea
what really happened last night.

44:02.456 --> 44:05.742
- l'm all ears.
- Someday.

44:09.257 --> 44:11.333
Andrea, what do you do
when you find out that

44:11.510 --> 44:14.926
someone you care for isn't the person
you thought they were at all?

44:16.307 --> 44:20.092
Brand-o,
there's something l wanna show you.

44:21.022 --> 44:24.356
Brandon, this is your brain.

44:25.236 --> 44:27.276
This is your brain on drugs.

44:27.489 --> 44:31.618
And this is your brain on drugs after
a Friday night with Emily Valentine.

44:34.456 --> 44:35.950
Any questions?

44:36.125 --> 44:38.877
Yeah, can l get some bacon
and toast with this?

44:39.305 --> 44:45.550
