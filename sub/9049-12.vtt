WEBVTT

00:01.404 --> 00:04.606
Hear ye, hear ye.

00:04.608 --> 00:06.742
Hear ye, hear ye.

00:06.744 --> 00:10.912
I hereby call to order the first team
Austin meeting in many a fortnight,

00:10.914 --> 00:14.783
and put forth the decree that
we don our tricorn hats.

00:17.820 --> 00:19.888
Dez, why are you
talking like that?

00:19.890 --> 00:21.923
And why are you
dressed like that?

00:21.925 --> 00:23.859
I don't know. It's been
so long since we had

00:23.861 --> 00:26.261
a team Austin meeting that I
don't remember what to do.

00:26.263 --> 00:29.664
Oh, usually you make weird suggestions
and act like a total doof.

00:29.666 --> 00:31.767
Oh, good. So I'm doing
the right thing.

00:31.769 --> 00:35.370
Well, since Jimmy starr lifted
Austin's performance ban,

00:35.372 --> 00:36.905
I've got an announcement.

00:36.907 --> 00:39.741
Guess who booked Austin's
comeback concert!

00:39.743 --> 00:40.876
Thank you!

00:40.878 --> 00:41.821
Trish, that's amazing!

00:41.852 --> 00:44.780
Oh, it's gonna feel so good
to be back up on stage again.

00:44.782 --> 00:48.216
It's gonna feel so good to have a
best friend I can be proud of again.

00:48.218 --> 00:49.218
Thanks?

00:49.952 --> 00:52.220
This show is gonna be huge.

00:52.222 --> 00:54.356
Your fans haven't seen
you perform in so long.

00:54.358 --> 00:56.425
They're going to expect
something incredible.

00:56.427 --> 00:59.027
Which means we need a
spectacular entrance.

00:59.029 --> 01:01.663
Lucky for you, I've had a lot
of time to think about this,

01:01.665 --> 01:03.231
so I have a few ideas.

01:06.602 --> 01:07.636
Number one:

01:07.638 --> 01:08.513
Ride in on a camel.

01:08.544 --> 01:11.873
Could be one hump or two, but
two's a little more expensive.

01:11.875 --> 01:14.776
Ride in on an ostrich.

01:14.778 --> 01:17.479
Could be male or female, but
male's a little more violent.

01:17.481 --> 01:20.015
Ride in on a reindeer.

01:20.017 --> 01:22.584
Regular or flying, flying
ones are only seasonal.

01:22.586 --> 01:24.553
Ride in on a whale.

01:24.555 --> 01:26.788
Killer or humpback. Humpback
has a bigger blowhole

01:26.790 --> 01:28.430
if you want to shoot
fireworks out of it.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.949 --> 02:29.084
Okay, just one more store.

02:29.086 --> 02:31.720
Austin, I know you're excited,

02:31.722 --> 02:34.589
but you already bought 12
different jacket options

02:34.591 --> 02:36.925
for your comeback performance.
Just pick one.

02:36.927 --> 02:38.660
Well, I can't choose.
They're all so different.

02:38.662 --> 02:40.061
Really?

02:40.063 --> 02:41.997
What's the difference
between these two?

02:43.066 --> 02:46.501
This one's sky blue and
this one's blue sky.

02:48.738 --> 02:50.071
Hey, check it out!

02:50.073 --> 02:52.574
A fortune teller. Maybe
she can help me decide.

02:52.576 --> 02:53.675
Ha! Good one.

02:53.677 --> 02:56.778
What goofball is gonna walk up to
a stranger in the mall and say,

02:56.780 --> 02:58.847
"here's my money.
Tell me my future."

02:58.849 --> 03:00.916
Here's my money,
tell me my future.

03:00.918 --> 03:02.784
Welcome, seekers.

03:02.786 --> 03:05.487
I am miss Claire.

03:05.489 --> 03:08.356
Miss Claire voyant.

03:08.358 --> 03:11.493
Really? Claire voyant?

03:11.495 --> 03:13.795
Your name literally
means fortune teller?

03:13.797 --> 03:17.599
I bet that's not what it says
on your driver's license.

03:20.070 --> 03:22.671
Huh, it does.

03:22.673 --> 03:24.439
I tell only the truth.

03:24.441 --> 03:26.942
Well, I did lie on
my dating profile.

03:26.944 --> 03:30.045
I don't really like foreign
films or outdoor activities.

03:30.047 --> 03:33.048
Now, would you like a
glimpse into your destiny?

03:33.050 --> 03:36.518
Sure. What do you got?

03:36.520 --> 03:42.657
You, Ally Dawson, will have an
unexpected visitor from a far-off place.

03:42.659 --> 03:45.627
Wait, how did you know my name?

03:45.629 --> 03:48.029
You're famous and I'm a fan.

03:58.574 --> 04:00.175
So what's the crystal
ball say about me?

04:00.177 --> 04:01.142
Don't touch my ball.

04:01.144 --> 04:02.177
Oh.

04:02.179 --> 04:02.966
Why?

04:02.997 --> 04:06.114
Because it's a magical object
that connects its users

04:06.116 --> 04:08.149
to the mysteries
of the universe?

04:08.151 --> 04:11.453
No, because it's an
expensive wi-fi router

04:11.455 --> 04:15.523
that connects its user to the
mysteries of the Internet.

04:15.525 --> 04:17.826
Ha! So you admit you're a fake.

04:17.827 --> 04:22.197
Oh, no. Those with the gift don't
need a phony prop to see the future.

04:23.132 --> 04:25.200
So what do you see for me?
I bet it's awesome.

04:25.202 --> 04:28.703
My big comeback show is coming up
so you probably see me rocking out,

04:28.705 --> 04:30.038
wearing a really cool jacket.

04:30.040 --> 04:31.906
Maybe it's sky blue,
maybe it's blue sky...

04:31.908 --> 04:34.776
your great expectations
will end in disaster!

04:34.778 --> 04:37.112
Failure is in your future.

04:39.215 --> 04:40.815
So...

04:40.817 --> 04:43.084
I should go with a vest then?

04:49.158 --> 04:50.307
I mean, should I be worried?

04:50.338 --> 04:52.727
Nothing can go wrong with
my comeback show, right?

04:52.729 --> 04:56.064
Of course not. That fortune teller has
no idea what she's talking about.

04:56.066 --> 04:59.167
Yeah, stop worrying about her and
start worrying about your concert.

04:59.169 --> 05:01.636
That psychic stuff
is a bunch of hooey.

05:01.638 --> 05:02.871
No, it's not.

05:02.873 --> 05:04.906
My grandmother had the sight.

05:04.908 --> 05:07.942
When I was thirteen, she
predicted my voice would change.

05:07.944 --> 05:09.878
And I'd start growing
facial hair.

05:11.814 --> 05:13.515
Dez, that's puberty.

05:13.517 --> 05:15.850
Okay, Ally. Whatever
you want to believe.

05:18.654 --> 05:21.222
There's no way this concert
will be a disaster.

05:21.224 --> 05:23.024
Everything will be perfect.

05:23.026 --> 05:24.826
Starting with these
posters I had printed up.

05:24.828 --> 05:26.928
Why does it say Austin Goon?

05:26.930 --> 05:28.229
What?

05:28.231 --> 05:29.597
Uh...

05:29.599 --> 05:31.966
No big deal. I'll just fix them.

05:31.968 --> 05:33.802
Good thing I only made 1,000.

05:35.705 --> 05:38.540
Dez, let's talk about
my actual performance.

05:38.542 --> 05:40.508
How are the plans for my
grand entrance coming?

05:40.510 --> 05:42.544
Well, I've got good
news, bad news.

05:42.546 --> 05:45.046
Good news, bad news, good news,
bad news, and good news.

05:45.048 --> 05:47.782
Good news, I found the two-hump
camel we've been looking for.

05:47.784 --> 05:49.984
- Oh.
- She ran away.

05:49.986 --> 05:53.054
I found a backup camel
that's even cuter.

05:53.056 --> 05:54.089
- Oh!
- Bad news:

05:54.091 --> 05:55.924
He also ran away.

05:55.926 --> 05:59.327
Good news... can you just skip
ahead to the final good news?

05:59.329 --> 06:02.063
I came up with an even better
idea for your entrance.

06:03.132 --> 06:04.199
Behold...

06:04.201 --> 06:06.534
The confetti cannon!

06:06.536 --> 06:07.569
Awesome!

06:07.571 --> 06:08.305
- How fun!
- Cool!

06:08.336 --> 06:11.269
Let's test it out. Pretend it's the
beginning of my show and announce me.

06:12.241 --> 06:18.646
Ladies and gentlemen, the
one, the only Austin Goon!

06:18.648 --> 06:19.681
Dez!

06:19.683 --> 06:21.116
That's what the poster says.

06:22.551 --> 06:24.285
Hello, Miami!

06:27.189 --> 06:28.070
Ow.

06:28.101 --> 06:31.593
Mmm, probably should have
tested it out on a dummy first.

06:31.595 --> 06:33.595
I know where we can find one.

06:36.232 --> 06:39.300
Okay, so I know the confetti
cannon may have had some kinks.

06:42.605 --> 06:45.206
No kidding. A piece of
confetti scratched my eye

06:45.208 --> 06:46.941
and now I have to wear
this stupid patch.

06:46.943 --> 06:49.611
Don't worry buddy,
I got you covered.

06:51.981 --> 06:54.315
Here. You might want to get
started on the other 999.

06:55.251 --> 06:56.785
This is a disaster.

06:56.787 --> 06:58.653
My big comeback performance
is gonna be a failure,

06:58.655 --> 07:00.422
just like miss Claire predicted.

07:00.424 --> 07:02.357
Austin, come on.

07:02.359 --> 07:04.859
You know there isn't any
truth to that psychic stuff.

07:04.861 --> 07:06.294
It's just a coincidence.

07:06.296 --> 07:08.863
Besides, your eye will be
better by the concert.

07:08.865 --> 07:11.900
Yeah, and if it isn't we'll get
you a pirate hat and a peg leg

07:11.902 --> 07:14.269
and you can open with
"steal your hearrrt."

07:15.939 --> 07:18.006
Yeah, and then "who you arrre."

07:18.008 --> 07:19.641
- Oh, oh and then...
- I get it.

07:20.976 --> 07:22.844
Okay, let's focus
on your opening.

07:22.846 --> 07:24.145
Picture this.

07:24.147 --> 07:27.282
A cloud of smoke, Austin
is nowhere to be found.

07:27.284 --> 07:28.883
Suddenly...

07:28.885 --> 07:33.054
He emerges from the fog, bathed
in the golden orb of light.

07:35.792 --> 07:37.158
Cool!

07:38.093 --> 07:39.661
Oh, I see.

07:39.663 --> 07:40.857
Brilliant, Dez.

07:40.888 --> 07:45.663
Austin's emergence from the fog symbolizes
his momentous return to the stage.

07:47.036 --> 07:48.102
Uh-huh.

07:50.039 --> 07:52.640
All right, peg leg, let's
take it from the top.

07:53.642 --> 07:54.943
Hello, Miami!

07:54.945 --> 07:56.911
This first song's called
"take it from the top."

07:56.913 --> 07:57.913
Hit it!

08:01.885 --> 08:03.685
Ow!

08:05.688 --> 08:07.956
Great, now I have one
eye and a sprained toe.

08:07.958 --> 08:09.324
You think that's bad?

08:09.326 --> 08:11.292
When you knocked into
me, I lost a tooth.

08:11.294 --> 08:12.927
Oh no, Dez. Which one?

08:12.929 --> 08:14.729
Huh? Oh, not one of my teeth.

08:14.731 --> 08:15.513
My grandma's tooth.

08:15.544 --> 08:17.365
I keep it in my
pocket for good luck.

08:17.367 --> 08:19.434
It's gotta be around
here somewhere.

08:20.369 --> 08:22.971
Well, some "good luck."
Everything's gone wrong.

08:22.973 --> 08:25.206
Now do you believe in
miss Claire's prediction?

08:25.208 --> 08:27.041
No, I don't.

08:27.043 --> 08:29.077
If miss Claire's
predictions are real,

08:29.079 --> 08:31.379
then where's my visitor
from a far-off place?

08:35.251 --> 08:36.417
Who's that?

08:37.352 --> 08:39.888
Oh, um, it's, uh...

08:40.823 --> 08:42.423
Wrong number.

08:42.424 --> 08:44.993
Ally, I know when you're lying.

08:44.995 --> 08:46.728
You always twirl your hair.

08:46.730 --> 08:47.730
What?

08:51.134 --> 08:52.400
Okay, fine.

08:52.402 --> 08:53.868
It's my mom.

08:53.870 --> 08:57.772
She just texted me that she's coming home
from Africa for a spontaneous visit.

08:57.774 --> 09:00.808
An unexpected visitor
from a far-off place!

09:00.810 --> 09:03.811
See, everything miss Claire
said is coming true.

09:03.813 --> 09:04.913
Oh!

09:05.848 --> 09:07.715
Found the tooth.

09:07.717 --> 09:09.717
Oh, no. False alarm.

09:09.719 --> 09:10.818
Just a breath mint.

09:12.154 --> 09:13.788
Nope, it's a tooth.

09:20.396 --> 09:23.331
All right. Let's settle
this once and for all.

09:23.333 --> 09:26.401
Miss Claire, will you please tell my
friend that you made all that stuff up?

09:26.403 --> 09:30.038
Yeah! And after that, can you tell me
the winning lotto numbers for tomorrow?

09:30.040 --> 09:32.740
Dez, this is about Austin.

09:32.742 --> 09:36.277
He has a big show coming up, and your
psychic mumbo jumbo is freaking him out.

09:36.279 --> 09:38.479
I'm sorry, but I see what I see.

09:38.481 --> 09:40.481
Your fate is sealed.

09:40.483 --> 09:43.017
See, I told you. Now, let's go.

09:43.019 --> 09:44.319
Hang on!

09:44.321 --> 09:46.788
What if we do another reading?

09:46.790 --> 09:51.125
Um, maybe this time you'll see
something a little more... Favorable?

09:53.395 --> 09:55.229
Ah!

09:55.231 --> 09:57.498
I'm now seeing...

09:57.500 --> 09:59.534
The same thing I saw before.

09:59.536 --> 10:00.768
Failure.

10:00.770 --> 10:01.869
All right, all right.

10:01.871 --> 10:03.438
I know what's going on here.

10:03.440 --> 10:04.472
Um...

10:04.474 --> 10:05.940
What do you see now?

10:08.444 --> 10:10.011
Ah...

10:10.013 --> 10:11.479
I'm now seeing

10:11.481 --> 10:14.515
you wasting your time.

10:14.517 --> 10:16.484
I'm not changing my prediction.

10:16.486 --> 10:18.453
You will fail.

10:18.455 --> 10:22.023
Well, this is making
me feel a lot better.

10:23.092 --> 10:25.193
Hate to break it to you,
lady, but you're wrong.

10:25.195 --> 10:27.829
My friend is going to put on a
disaster-free show this weekend.

10:27.831 --> 10:31.833
Yeah, and there's nothing you or your
crummy crystal ball can do about it.

10:31.835 --> 10:32.835
Yeah!

10:35.571 --> 10:38.406
But since Ally already paid you,
what do you see in my future?

10:38.408 --> 10:41.275
Ah.

10:41.277 --> 10:45.246
You will soon fall in love
with a loyal, handsome,

10:45.248 --> 10:48.082
well-mannered,
dark-haired prince

10:48.084 --> 10:50.952
who likes cuddling and
long walks on the beach.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.954
Oh! I knew you were
the real deal.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.389
So, about my prince, is he...

10:54.391 --> 10:55.857
- Trish!
- Coming.

11:01.263 --> 11:02.930
This is all the money I have.

11:02.932 --> 11:04.532
Tell me what you see.

11:04.534 --> 11:05.534
Ah.

11:10.906 --> 11:13.541
I can't shake this bad feeling
about miss Claire's prediction.

11:13.543 --> 11:15.510
My comeback performance
can't be a failure.

11:15.512 --> 11:17.311
This was supposed
to be my big night.

11:17.313 --> 11:18.946
And it will be.

11:18.948 --> 11:21.883
Your eye has healed,
your toe is better.

11:21.885 --> 11:23.618
I think you're letting your
nerves get the best of you.

11:23.620 --> 11:25.053
No, it's not my nerves.

11:25.055 --> 11:26.554
I'm a confident, levelheaded guy

11:26.556 --> 11:28.923
who's obviously been cursed
by an evil sorceress.

11:29.858 --> 11:31.125
I'm gonna cancel the show.

11:31.127 --> 11:33.561
But... no, you're not.

11:33.563 --> 11:37.231
So, miss Claire got one thing right
when she predicted my mom's visit.

11:37.233 --> 11:38.966
That doesn't mean anything.

11:38.968 --> 11:41.869
But what about all these bad
omens that keep happening to me?

11:41.871 --> 11:44.338
Dez's confetti cannon, Dez's
fog machine, Dez's...

11:44.340 --> 11:45.640
wait a minute.

11:46.975 --> 11:48.643
What's the common denominator?

11:48.645 --> 11:50.378
I don't know.

11:50.380 --> 11:52.246
Think about it.

11:52.248 --> 11:56.484
No... I don't know what a
common denominator is.

11:56.486 --> 11:57.320
It's Dez!

11:57.351 --> 12:00.685
Everything that's gone
wrong is because of him.

12:01.924 --> 12:05.259
I know he means well, but
when you add it all up,

12:05.261 --> 12:08.596
maybe we need to subtract
him from the equation.

12:08.598 --> 12:10.898
Can you stop speaking math?

12:10.900 --> 12:14.669
I'm just saying, if you
want to avoid disaster.

12:14.671 --> 12:17.605
Maybe he's not the right person
to plan your big entrance.

12:17.607 --> 12:19.674
But he's so excited about it.

12:19.676 --> 12:22.009
I can't tell him to stay away
from my big comeback performance.

12:22.011 --> 12:23.354
That would hurt his feelings.

12:23.385 --> 12:25.947
Well, his hurt feelings
are your hurt body parts.

12:25.949 --> 12:28.583
Either way, someone's
getting hurt.

12:30.220 --> 12:31.619
Hey, guys.

12:31.621 --> 12:34.622
Just wondering, have
either of you seen a guy

12:34.624 --> 12:38.025
oh, I don't know, dark-haired,
handsome, princely?

12:39.495 --> 12:42.663
No? Okay, well if you do, can you
give him this glass slipper?

12:42.665 --> 12:44.699
It has my name and ring
size on the bottom.

12:44.701 --> 12:45.967
Thanks.

12:49.638 --> 12:51.405
She looks good in a tiara.

12:56.211 --> 12:58.479
Well, buddy. You
can thank me now.

12:58.481 --> 13:01.649
Because I've come up with the
most epic entrance of all time.

13:01.651 --> 13:03.351
Behold...

13:05.254 --> 13:06.687
The box!

13:08.023 --> 13:10.458
I don't know, Dez. Maybe I
don't need a big entrance.

13:10.460 --> 13:12.601
I already have this cool
new jacket, plus, I

13:12.632 --> 13:14.695
have 12 costume changes
throughout the show.

13:14.697 --> 13:17.064
Since I couldn't return
any of the other jackets.

13:17.066 --> 13:19.500
But this is going to
blow people's minds!

13:19.502 --> 13:21.969
You're going to fly over
the audience in this box.

13:21.971 --> 13:24.972
People will look up, and see
you dancing high above them.

13:24.974 --> 13:28.543
They'll be looking up while
you're getting down.

13:29.578 --> 13:30.978
It seems a little dangerous.

13:30.980 --> 13:32.680
Ah, that's where you're wrong.

13:32.682 --> 13:34.749
This thing is
completely unbreakable.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.652
Once you're inside,
nothing can hurt you.

13:37.654 --> 13:39.687
Nothing gets in.

13:39.689 --> 13:41.556
Nothing gets out.

13:42.592 --> 13:43.758
Wait, nothing gets out?

13:43.760 --> 13:45.326
That's right!

13:45.328 --> 13:47.595
Well, then how am I
supposed to get out?

13:49.565 --> 13:51.766
You know what, maybe you
don't need a big entrance.

13:51.768 --> 13:54.001
- Dez, get me out of here!
- I can't.

13:54.003 --> 13:55.703
My show is tonight. What
am I supposed to do?

13:55.705 --> 13:57.505
Don't worry, I'll
think of something.

13:57.507 --> 14:00.474
No, don't think of anything.

14:01.443 --> 14:02.610
Look...

14:02.612 --> 14:05.146
I hate to say it but
I think you might be

14:05.148 --> 14:07.381
the disaster miss Claire
was talking about.

14:10.719 --> 14:11.786
What are you saying?

14:13.689 --> 14:15.389
I think you know
what I'm saying.

14:16.692 --> 14:19.594
No, I actually can't hear you in there.
What are you saying?

14:21.129 --> 14:24.498
I can't have you be part of my
comeback performance anymore.

14:24.500 --> 14:26.701
You need to stay away!

14:26.703 --> 14:29.136
Just until the show's over.

14:30.606 --> 14:32.039
Oh.

14:33.508 --> 14:36.177
I guess miss Claire's prediction
came true for me, too.

14:36.179 --> 14:38.312
She said I'd be betrayed
by a good friend.

14:41.216 --> 14:42.550
Dez, wait!

14:54.097 --> 14:56.797
Nothing's working and
we've tried everything.

14:56.799 --> 15:01.335
I mean, the jagged, edgy thing, the
fire squirter, the bangy-bangy.

15:01.337 --> 15:03.471
Did you just call the
hammer a "bangy-bangy"?

15:03.473 --> 15:05.106
What? I don't know tools!

15:05.841 --> 15:08.109
Okay, I just got off the phone
with the fire department.

15:08.111 --> 15:09.351
They'll be here in an hour.

15:09.382 --> 15:11.646
I'm supposed to go
on stage in an hour.

15:11.648 --> 15:14.482
When you call the fire department,
aren't they supposed to come right away?

15:14.484 --> 15:16.250
Yeah! When there's a fire.

15:16.252 --> 15:18.686
I hate to break it to you,
but a pop star in a box

15:18.688 --> 15:20.454
isn't at the top of
their priority list.

15:20.456 --> 15:22.790
We have to leave now if we
want to make it to your show.

15:22.792 --> 15:24.692
- We'll have them meet us at the arena.
- Yeah.

15:27.462 --> 15:31.098
I know this seems horrible,
but look at it this way;

15:31.100 --> 15:32.667
if you're concert is a disaster,

15:32.669 --> 15:34.735
it means miss Claire's
predictions are coming true.

15:34.737 --> 15:36.537
I'm gonna meet my prince.

15:36.539 --> 15:40.608
And... big picture, isn't that
what's best for all of us?

15:42.744 --> 15:43.778
Sorry.

15:46.348 --> 15:48.149
Austin! Austin!

15:48.151 --> 15:49.784
Austin! Austin!

15:49.786 --> 15:50.513
Austin!

15:50.544 --> 15:53.421
The fire department should
be here any minute.

15:53.423 --> 15:54.789
Well, they better hurry!

15:54.791 --> 15:56.590
I've been waiting
months for tonight.

15:56.592 --> 15:59.527
I can't do my big comeback
performance from inside a box.

15:59.529 --> 16:02.396
None of this would have
happened if it wasn't for Dez.

16:02.398 --> 16:04.875
When I'm royalty, my
first order of business

16:04.906 --> 16:06.867
will be to appoint
him court Jester.

16:06.869 --> 16:08.736
He already has the pants.

16:08.738 --> 16:10.271
You should talk.

16:10.273 --> 16:11.772
What are you wearing?

16:11.774 --> 16:13.908
Oh, this old thing?

16:13.910 --> 16:15.629
Ah, it's just
something I threw on.

16:15.660 --> 16:20.177
It's not like it's something a prince
would expect a princess to be wearing.

16:20.916 --> 16:22.483
I feel bad about Dez.

16:22.485 --> 16:26.854
I know this is all his fault,
but I was really hard on him.

16:26.856 --> 16:29.156
I mean, he's my best friend.

16:29.158 --> 16:31.926
Tonight doesn't feel right
without him by my side.

16:31.928 --> 16:33.494
Aw.

16:35.398 --> 16:36.398
Places.

16:36.423 --> 16:40.368
Wait, but the fire department should be
here any minute to get him out of there.

16:40.370 --> 16:42.870
Out of the way, ladies.
Show must go on.

16:44.172 --> 16:45.306
Good luck, Austin.

16:49.878 --> 16:51.779
Wait, I can't go on like this.

16:51.781 --> 16:53.814
Ah, don't worry.
We'll rig you up

16:53.816 --> 16:57.518
with a nice microphone so everyone
can hear you singing inside.

16:57.520 --> 16:59.854
But how am I supposed to
do my show from in here?

17:00.594 --> 17:03.391
I've been in the business
a long time, kid.

17:03.393 --> 17:04.925
I've seen it all.

17:04.926 --> 17:06.761
Trust me, you'll be all right.

17:06.762 --> 17:08.396
Or my name isn't, uh...

17:08.397 --> 17:09.430
Uh...

17:09.432 --> 17:10.897
Ah, who cares what my name is.

17:10.900 --> 17:11.799
Have a good show.

17:11.829 --> 17:14.602
Austin! Austin! Austin!

17:14.604 --> 17:16.871
Austin! Austin! Austin!

19:20.429 --> 19:22.329
- Wow!
- Amazing!

19:22.331 --> 19:24.411
Whew! That could have
gone really bad.

19:24.900 --> 19:26.333
What?

19:32.475 --> 19:34.375
Thank you, Miami!

19:34.377 --> 19:35.543
Oh!

19:35.545 --> 19:37.111
That was amazing!

19:37.113 --> 19:38.379
Yeah!

19:39.314 --> 19:42.049
Congratulations, Austin!
I am so proud of you!

19:42.051 --> 19:43.216
Everyone loved you up there.

19:43.247 --> 19:45.950
That was definitely an entrance
they've never seen before.

19:46.855 --> 19:48.923
Dez, I don't know
how to thank you.

19:48.925 --> 19:51.759
I guess I should start
by saying I'm sorry.

19:51.761 --> 19:54.028
I should have known you'd
come through for me.

19:54.030 --> 19:56.063
Hey, have I ever made
a mistake before?

19:56.065 --> 19:57.831
18 times this week alone.

19:57.833 --> 19:59.600
Exactly!

19:59.602 --> 20:01.035
Welcome back, bro.

20:03.104 --> 20:06.140
So, given that Austin
had a great show,

20:06.142 --> 20:09.143
it would appear that miss Claire's
predictions aren't always right.

20:10.145 --> 20:14.782
So much for my loyal, handsome,
well-mannered, dark-haired prince.

20:17.085 --> 20:19.453
Hey there, little buddy.

20:19.455 --> 20:21.522
Where did you come from?

20:21.524 --> 20:24.959
Oh, my drummer's dog just had puppies
and he's looking for homes for them.

20:24.961 --> 20:27.094
You're a handsome
boy, yes you are!

20:27.096 --> 20:28.696
Sit!

20:28.698 --> 20:31.098
Oh, it's so well-mannered!

20:31.100 --> 20:32.600
Oh!

20:32.602 --> 20:34.001
Oh, look!

20:34.003 --> 20:37.404
This collar says his
name is prince.

20:38.139 --> 20:42.576
And I'm guessing he likes
long walks and cuddling.

20:42.578 --> 20:45.045
My prince has finally arrived.

20:46.147 --> 20:48.182
Aw!

20:53.188 --> 20:55.656
I still can't believe
that concert last night.

20:55.658 --> 20:57.024
Austin, you were amazing.

20:57.026 --> 21:00.995
I'm just glad my comeback is out
of the way and I can just be back.

21:00.997 --> 21:02.496
So, how's your prince, Trish?

21:02.498 --> 21:05.032
Oh, I am totally
in love with him.

21:05.034 --> 21:08.135
Plus, he obeys commands way
better than my last boyfriend.

21:09.804 --> 21:11.944
So, after all that, every
one of miss Claire's

21:11.956 --> 21:14.108
predictions came true
except for mine.

21:14.110 --> 21:17.745
I wonder what she meant by, "your great
expectations will end in disaster.

21:17.747 --> 21:19.446
"Failure is in your future."

21:19.448 --> 21:21.649
Oh.

21:22.584 --> 21:25.486
Oh, the grades for our English
paper just got posted.

21:25.488 --> 21:26.920
Got an a.

21:26.922 --> 21:27.963
What English paper?

21:27.994 --> 21:32.126
<i>The one we were supposed to write
on the book great expectations.</i>

21:32.128 --> 21:34.128
You didn't do yours, did you?

21:34.130 --> 21:37.464
I was so worried about my
comeback, I forgot all about it.

21:38.768 --> 21:42.703
<i>Which means "your great
expectations will end in disaster.</i>

21:42.705 --> 21:44.138
"Failure is in your future."

21:44.140 --> 21:46.907
Oh!

21:46.909 --> 21:49.209
Aw.

21:50.145 --> 21:51.245
Give me that puppy.

21:53.848 --> 21:55.683
There, now I feel better.

21:56.786 --> 21:58.152
Aw.
