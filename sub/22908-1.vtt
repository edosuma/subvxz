[man] <i>Yeah, um, could you please
send someone to 452 Meredith Lane?</i>

00:22.821 --> 00:26.423
<i>We have, um, some,
some bodies here.</i>

00:26.425 --> 00:27.493
<i>Do you need medical?</i>

00:27.827 --> 00:29.560
<i>Um, no, no, ma'am.</i>

00:29.562 --> 00:31.164
<i>All right, so the parties
are deceased?</i>

00:31.696 --> 00:33.132
- <i>Yes.</i>
- <i>Are you safe?</i>

00:33.365 --> 00:34.564
<i>Yeah, we're the neighbors.</i>

00:34.566 --> 00:36.500
<i>We, we heard some shots
and came over and...</i>

00:36.502 --> 00:37.771
<i>Is there anyone
else in the house?</i>

00:38.972 --> 00:41.338
<i>Just a little girl.
She's upstairs with my wife.</i>

00:41.340 --> 00:43.209
<i>Okay, someone will
be there right away.</i>

00:43.642 --> 00:44.711

spirituality, metaphysics...</i>

01:02.427 --> 01:04.230
whatever you wanna
call it,

01:05.197 --> 01:08.464
are tempted to shut
the idea out completely...

01:08.466 --> 01:12.771
I think that it's important that the
question be asked, what is the difference

01:13.605 --> 01:18.444
between the material that they talk
about and study and meditate upon,

01:19.378 --> 01:22.379
and the spirit
which we talk about

01:22.381 --> 01:24.150
and study and meditate upon.

01:24.917 --> 01:28.588
Is there actually a difference?
Or is it really just...

01:29.287 --> 01:32.191
a different way
of thinking or of seeing?

01:33.292 --> 01:35.495
And I'm not so sure
that there is a difference.

01:37.296 --> 01:39.163
Anyway, these are just...
they are some of the ideas

01:39.165 --> 01:40.867
that I hope
come across in the novel.

01:43.302 --> 01:45.371
All right, I'm, I'm out of words.
[chuckles]

01:45.638 --> 01:47.404
[interviewer]
I'm sure that's not true.

01:47.406 --> 01:49.843
But that does
bring us to a close.

01:50.275 --> 01:51.643
So I wanna thank you all
for being here

01:53.012 --> 01:55.244
and a very special thanks to Miranda
Ruth for making time for us.

01:55.246 --> 01:56.448

for college, so yeah.</i>

02:33.752 --> 02:39.989
Well... I'm not sure how exciting I'd
be but of course I'd love to have her.

02:39.991 --> 02:43.762
- Um, how long?
- <i>I don't know. Couple of weeks?</i>

02:46.365 --> 02:49.903
That would be fine. Um...
When were you thinking?

02:50.868 --> 02:52.604
<i>As soon as possible.</i>

02:54.406 --> 02:57.911

Hi.

04:31.970 --> 04:34.407
Oh, welcome, sweetheart.

04:35.841 --> 04:37.776
- Thanks.
- Um-hmm, come on then.

04:38.976 --> 04:40.947
- How was your flight?
- A little bumpy.

04:41.346 --> 04:44.283
- Yeah? Oh, can I get that?
- Oh, no, no, no, thanks, I got it.

04:45.016 --> 04:46.750
You were little

04:46.752 --> 04:48.454
You probably don't
remember this place.

04:48.786 --> 04:50.989
I do... now.

04:52.790 --> 04:55.862
I live upstairs. So why don't you
come on in, we'll get you settled.

05:05.803 --> 05:08.807
- And here it is.
- Oh.

05:13.745 --> 05:18.050

for a really nice reading nook.

05:18.483 --> 05:19.786
Oh, I don't really read.

05:21.987 --> 05:27.060
Well, there're some real gems on the
bookshelf if you decide to give it a go.

05:29.961 --> 05:31.396
Do you have WiFi?

05:31.596 --> 05:34.930
I do. Uh, RalphWaldo

05:47.812 --> 05:49.514
Got it. Thank you.

05:51.115 --> 05:53.051
That's the year <i>The Scarlet

05:53.451 --> 05:54.584
Yeah, yeah.

05:54.586 --> 05:56.719
- Cool. [chuckles]
- Are you hungry?

05:56.721 --> 05:57.820

06:29.788 --> 06:31.555
Hey, I'm just about ready.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.957
Um, you can go take a peek
out back if you like,

06:33.959 --> 06:35.595
I think that's where
we're gonna eat lunch.

06:38.029 --> 06:39.498
Do you eat potato salad?
Oh, shit!

06:39.898 --> 06:41.667
- What?
- Are you vegetarian?

06:43.968 --> 06:47.173
- I'm sorry. I have...
- No, no, no, no... [laughs]

06:47.605 --> 06:49.105
- You're not?
- No, I'm kidding. [laughs]

06:49.107 --> 06:50.510
You're so bad.

07:46.865 --> 07:49.468
Your dad told me that you were thinking
about coming up here for college?

07:49.668 --> 07:51.901
- That's exciting.
- Yeah, maybe.

07:51.903 --> 07:54.473
Um... it depends on where
I can get a scholarship.

07:56.108 --> 08:00.045
Well, your mom went to DePaul, of course,
and that's a good one... and, um...

08:00.612 --> 08:04.817

where I teach occasionally.

Although, they're a little nuts
there so... [Cyd chuckles]

08:09.153 --> 08:10.152
...might want to
avoid that one.

08:10.154 --> 08:12.557
[laughs]
Okay. Will do.

08:16.194 --> 08:21.501
What about you? Um, how's...
books, how's books and stuff?

08:23.701 --> 08:25.170
Books and stuff are good.
[chuckles]

08:25.937 --> 08:27.637
I've been doing
I feel a lot of press

08:27.639 --> 08:30.339
for this new thing,
uh, this novel...

08:30.341 --> 08:33.078
- Hmm, what's it called?
- <i>In the Dawn.</i>

08:34.046 --> 08:36.649
- What's it about?
- Oh, really?

08:38.115 --> 08:39.682
Well, it's about... [sighs]

08:39.683 --> 08:41.818
It's about this woman
named Jacqueline,

08:41.820 --> 08:43.756
and on her 50th birthday, she...

08:44.822 --> 08:47.225
- You sure you want to hear this?
- Sure.

08:48.059 --> 08:51.296
Um, what else are we gonna talk about?
[both chuckle]

08:51.763 --> 08:54.066
Good point. Um...

08:54.899 --> 08:55.967
So on her 50th birthday,

08:57.034 --> 08:58.169
she starts to become
extra sensitive to the sun,

08:59.236 --> 09:02.872
um, it starts to affect her...
her relationships,

09:02.874 --> 09:05.644
her friendships, her work...

09:06.144 --> 09:08.277
Uh... well,
I'm not sure how much

09:08.279 --> 09:10.379
you really want
me to tell you...

09:10.381 --> 09:12.250
- but...
- You can tell me all of it.

09:13.884 --> 09:15.187
That's no fun.

09:15.821 --> 09:17.286
Well... isn't that, like,

09:17.288 --> 09:18.890
what you're supposed to do
with stories?

09:19.658 --> 09:21.693
Well... yeah,
but I mean when you...

09:23.394 --> 09:26.363
worked for two years on the
heart of it... [chuckles]

09:26.365 --> 09:28.301
Okay, but I'm not gonna read it.

09:30.735 --> 09:31.870
Fair enough.

09:33.739 --> 09:37.643
Um... well, come to find out
she's been doing a lot of...

09:38.110 --> 09:41.945
research on, uh, on this
condition called photo phobia...

09:41.947 --> 09:42.947
Is that real?

09:44.048 --> 09:45.848
It is, but in my version
it's a little heightened.

09:45.850 --> 09:47.186
Um, anyway, so she...

09:49.086 --> 09:51.921
she's doing this research
and then she realizes

09:51.923 --> 09:55.995
that it dates back centuries
in her own family and, uh...

09:56.727 --> 09:59.963
it's original name,
Aether Evaisthis'a,

09:59.965 --> 10:02.201
actually comes from a Greek god.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.037
- So, she...
- Oh, you write fantasy?

10:05.736 --> 10:09.074
No, no, I don't write fantasy.
A lot of my work has some...

10:09.908 --> 10:11.940
some metaphysical themes
and some spiritual themes

10:11.942 --> 10:13.678
but it's realism.

10:14.245 --> 10:16.215
- Um... it's true...
- Sounds like fantasy. [chuckles]

10:16.782 --> 10:18.684
No, no, it's not. It's...

10:19.350 --> 10:21.751
Um, so... she, uh,

10:21.753 --> 10:24.857
decides to go Greece
to get to the bottom of this...

10:25.289 --> 10:27.325
and then when she gets there,
she gets into this...

10:36.735 --> 10:38.169
[sighs deeply]

10:47.479 --> 10:49.849
[Jason Loughlin] Be good to see
where your mom came from, huh?

[light flute music playing]

11:46.270 --> 11:48.740
[rhythmic tapping on door]

11:51.475 --> 11:54.279
- Hey.
- [Anthony James] Hey, doll!

11:54.879 --> 11:57.347
We could have rescheduled. I didn't
mean to mess up time with your niece.

11:57.349 --> 11:59.382
Oh, no, no.
She's running some...

11:59.384 --> 12:01.353
We may never see her again.

12:02.019 --> 12:03.722
I haven't seen her
since she was...

12:04.956 --> 12:07.357
She must have been eight,
that's right after the funeral.

12:07.359 --> 12:09.124
I heard she was there
when it happened.

12:09.126 --> 12:13.028
Yes, fast asleep but...
yeah, she was in the house.

12:13.030 --> 12:14.099
Jesus!

12:16.534 --> 12:18.236
- She plays soccer.
- [Anthony chuckles]

12:18.570 --> 12:20.002
Whatever will you talk about?

12:20.004 --> 12:23.806
Ha, I...
That's the thing, I'm scared.

12:23.808 --> 12:26.044
And she seems funny,
she's smart but...

12:27.379 --> 12:29.447
I don't know,
hopefully she likes me.

12:30.148 --> 12:31.283
Rest assured.

12:33.552 --> 12:36.585
So, okay. Where did we...
Where did we leave off?

12:36.587 --> 12:39.388
Uh, part two,
chapter one but we can

12:39.390 --> 12:42.026
backtrack if you've got
any structural...

12:42.394 --> 12:44.493
How is our timing?
When are you showing this...

12:44.495 --> 12:46.064
I told them late summer.

12:46.498 --> 12:47.564
- Oh!
- Yeah.

12:47.566 --> 12:49.531
Well, then, it'll be fine
'cause I really think

12:49.533 --> 12:52.035
the second half, it's just more
about what can come out...

12:52.037 --> 12:55.341
- Rather than any drastic...
- Right, any drastic changes.

12:55.974 --> 12:59.142
Uh... but I will say
if we can back it up...

12:59.144 --> 13:00.475
I thought we might
want to zero in...

13:00.477 --> 13:02.947
If we can back it up
to the end of part one...

13:03.881 --> 13:06.384
um...
I just think it's sort of...

13:07.184 --> 13:10.052
No, it's these two opposing
problems that are dividing the book

13:10.054 --> 13:11.856
a third of the way in.
Um...

13:12.356 --> 13:14.894
the inner part one's characterization,
they're beautiful...

13:15.226 --> 13:18.261
They really are,
but I mentioned that last week

13:18.263 --> 13:19.863
I just think that
the information is just being

13:19.865 --> 13:21.466
kind of clunkily laid out.

13:21.899 --> 13:24.400
Right, which I personally
disagree with.

13:24.402 --> 13:26.469
Right, but that's why
you have come to your

13:26.471 --> 13:28.604
brilliant writer friend Miranda.

13:28.606 --> 13:30.873
- For her ideas.
- I have indeed.

13:30.875 --> 13:33.111
- Just so we're clear.
- And we are.

13:33.879 --> 13:35.445
Um...

13:35.447 --> 13:38.915
So you're starting with this
beautiful study momentum

13:38.917 --> 13:42.153
<i>at the top of part two with DeAndre
and the trail of the journalist.</i>

13:43.087 --> 13:46.256
<i>This is the smoothest most
energized passage in this book.</i>

13:46.258 --> 13:49.358
<i>And then you do
earn in chapter 12,</i>

13:49.360 --> 13:52.362
<i>this breathing space,
this nice patient</i>

13:52.364 --> 13:56.067
<i>lull that relaxes
and speaks to us.</i>

13:57.001 --> 13:59.535
<i>But once the journalist,
I don't know what his name is...</i>

13:59.537 --> 14:02.341
- <i>Earnest.</i>
- <i>Once he throws himself off the bridge,</i>

14:02.673 --> 14:04.206
<i>leaving DeAndre alone,
I think</i>

14:04.208 --> 14:06.978
<i>that's when the book is telling
you, you need to move.</i>

14:07.278 --> 14:08.447
<i>Just move, move, move.</i>

14:09.280 --> 14:12.584
So the philosophical tangents
in parts two and part three,

14:13.217 --> 14:16.685
they probably just need to go.
That's my biggest...

14:16.687 --> 14:19.321
I know, I ca... I can't believe
that I'm saying that.

14:19.323 --> 14:21.456
Who are you and
what have you done with Miranda?

14:21.458 --> 14:22.460
Right?

14:43.248 --> 14:44.550
[bell jingles]

14:45.115 --> 14:46.251
- [Cyd] Hi!
- [male] Hi.

14:47.352 --> 14:49.954
- Uh, I think I'm lost.
- Where're you trying to be?

14:50.322 --> 14:52.055
- Raven something...
- Ravenswood?

14:52.057 --> 14:54.357
Yes, but there's something else.

14:54.359 --> 14:55.427
[Katie Sauter] Gardens.

14:56.226 --> 14:57.663
Uh, yeah, yeah, that's it.

14:58.363 --> 15:01.064
East of the bridge. You're
actually in the right road.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.398
Just head straight west
a few blocks.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.535
It should start
to look familiar.

15:05.537 --> 15:07.506
Okay, thanks. Thanks.

15:17.381 --> 15:19.114
I didn't say the ending

15:19.116 --> 15:21.316
wasn't justified. I just said
it doesn't currently work.

15:21.318 --> 15:22.654
Because of the tangents?

15:24.188 --> 15:26.122
Possibly but it's also possible that
it doesn't work despite the tangents.

15:26.124 --> 15:27.558
Good lord. [Anthony laughs]

15:28.559 --> 15:30.660
I... Hey!

15:30.662 --> 15:32.362
Hey, sorry.
I can go back outside.

15:32.364 --> 15:35.968
No, no, no, no, no.
We were just having a discourse.

15:36.167 --> 15:38.237
Uh, Cyd,
this is my friend Anthony.

15:38.702 --> 15:40.238
- Hi.
- Hiya, Cyd.

15:40.739 --> 15:43.006
Anthony is an old
writer friend of mine.

15:43.008 --> 15:44.677
"Old writer friend,"
how flattering.

15:45.110 --> 15:49.315
Old Pulitzer Prize nominated
writer friend of mine, how's that?

15:49.748 --> 15:52.482
Anthony is
a well-respected journalist,

15:52.484 --> 15:55.350
writer of non-fiction
and now he's writing a novel,

15:55.352 --> 15:57.719
That's what we were discussing.

15:57.721 --> 16:00.223
Now he has to go talk about
the election on television.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.461
- Cool!
- I'd rather be doing anything else.

16:03.794 --> 16:06.396
Um, I'm gonna go take a shower.
I smell bad.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.567
Okay, there are towels right
outside the door on the shelf.

16:09.533 --> 16:11.334
- Nice to meet you, Cyd.
- Yeah, nice to meet you too.

16:11.336 --> 16:12.738
- See you Friday?
- Uh?

16:13.804 --> 16:16.039
Oh! The soiree?

16:16.041 --> 16:20.045
I haven't even told you about that yet.
All in good time. Yeah.

16:24.182 --> 16:26.217
I'm out. Thanks for this.

16:27.317 --> 16:29.020
It's really good, Anthony.

16:30.654 --> 16:33.192
Anyway, my thoughts are my thoughts.
It's your book.

16:36.461 --> 16:38.629
I know. [laughs]

16:39.831 --> 16:42.565
- How's Brandon?
- Oh, he's fine. He's fine.

16:42.567 --> 16:44.400
He's with his mom this week.

16:44.402 --> 16:47.536
Take him to his first Cub's
game for his 15th birthday

16:47.538 --> 16:49.772
- but he doesn't know it yet.
- Aw! He'll love that.

16:49.774 --> 16:51.076
I think so.

16:55.312 --> 16:57.149
- See you Friday.
- Bye.

17:19.304 --> 17:20.471
Wow.

17:26.611 --> 17:28.347
So what's the deal
with your friend?

17:29.480 --> 17:30.582
The deal?

17:31.382 --> 17:33.349
Uh, well...

17:33.351 --> 17:37.620
Anthony and I went to the
University of Chicago years ago

17:37.622 --> 17:41.692
when we were grad students.
Then we became fast friends.

17:42.794 --> 17:44.630
So, no romance?

17:45.230 --> 17:48.166
What? Oh, my God! No, no.

17:48.633 --> 17:50.565
Why, why do you ask?

17:50.567 --> 17:52.637
Just curious. He seemed nice.

17:53.805 --> 17:56.642
He is and a brilliant mind.

17:57.608 --> 17:58.810
He's handsome.

18:01.378 --> 18:04.348
He is. You should see his son.

18:05.282 --> 18:07.350
This beautiful boy.
He's gonna...

18:07.352 --> 18:08.918
swoop up all the ladies...

18:08.920 --> 18:12.157
[chuckles]
one day or the man or both.

18:14.692 --> 18:17.426
Anyway, he's married,
um, technically.

18:17.428 --> 18:20.199
What about you?
Do you have a boyfriend?

18:20.798 --> 18:23.501
- Yeah, kinda.
- Kinda?

18:25.569 --> 18:27.472
Mmm, wonderful.

18:27.771 --> 18:29.505
Anything else
I can get you ladies?

18:29.507 --> 18:31.740
No! I think this is fine.

18:31.742 --> 18:34.343
- Thank you, Sarah.
- My pleasure, Ms. Ruth. Enjoy.

18:34.345 --> 18:35.380
Thanks.

18:36.780 --> 18:39.248
She's wonderful. She's so sweet.

18:39.250 --> 18:41.854
- [exhales] So much food.
- I know.

18:42.886 --> 18:45.720
Are you sure you don't want
something other than just water?

18:45.722 --> 18:48.594
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine, thanks.
- Good for you.

18:50.795 --> 18:52.698
So did you come here
a lot growing up?

18:53.498 --> 18:55.734
Oh, yeah.
We came at least once a week.

18:56.800 --> 18:58.769
Your mom and I would get
pretty sick of it.

18:59.570 --> 19:03.307
- But, uh... now I love it.
- Cool.

19:07.644 --> 19:10.781
- So, uh... so the boy?
- What? Oh.

19:11.682 --> 19:15.520
Yeah, I don't know. I mean, we've
been hanging out for a while.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.891
- His name's Josh.
- Josh.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.393
He's fun.

19:22.594 --> 19:25.697
- Is he cute?
- Yeah, he's pretty hot.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.500
He's a good time.

19:30.602 --> 19:31.836
Well, that's great. That's...

19:33.137 --> 19:34.740
I'm so sorry to interrupt. Oh,
I see you just got your food.

19:34.972 --> 19:36.642
Would you mind
signing this book?

19:36.874 --> 19:38.440
I ran all the way home
to get it.

19:38.442 --> 19:39.644
- Oh!
- We love you.

19:39.876 --> 19:42.780
- Oh, sure. What's your name?
- Jennifer.

19:43.413 --> 19:44.779
Do you live in the neighborhood?

19:44.781 --> 19:46.915
Yeah, this is one
of our favorite places.

19:46.917 --> 19:49.986
I don't want to take much of your
time but I just want you to know

19:49.988 --> 19:51.722
how much I admire your work.

19:52.257 --> 19:55.760
Oh, thank you. That means so much to me.
Thank you.

19:56.461 --> 19:59.527
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

19:59.529 --> 20:02.233
- Have a great night.
- You, too. Thank you so much.

20:06.738 --> 20:09.807
- That's never not weird.
- It's pretty cool.

20:10.907 --> 20:14.879
[Irish folk music playing]

20:31.962 --> 20:34.563
So I finished two-thirds
of the essay.

20:34.565 --> 20:37.400
I finished...
uh, for some of them,

20:37.402 --> 20:41.472
I mean, I just revised because they
were in magazines or whatever.

20:41.772 --> 20:45.610
But, to be honest...
I already miss fiction.

20:45.910 --> 20:47.746
It's just... It's so different.

20:48.479 --> 20:50.548
You know?
On the one hand, you're just...

20:51.449 --> 20:54.350
trying to lay out the material
as elegantly as possible

20:54.352 --> 20:57.452
but then, on the other hand,
you're actually making...

20:57.454 --> 21:01.492
the thing and I... I suppose that's
not actually accurate but I just...

21:07.731 --> 21:08.733
Cyd?

21:15.673 --> 21:16.741
Cyd!

- Yeah, me too.

Um... Yeah. Absolutely.

23:23.134 --> 23:25.569
Cool. Could you put some
sunscreen on me?

23:27.605 --> 23:28.940

- Thanks.

- Yeah, that bed's super comfy.

That was mine, growing up.

quite as comfy but...

with her anyway.

in your old house.

you write all your books?

30:12.009 --> 30:14.011
She is. She is a writer.

30:14.411 --> 30:16.381
- What's her name?
- Miranda Ruth.

30:17.114 --> 30:19.550
- [chuckles] No way!
- You've heard of her?

30:20.084 --> 30:21.352
Yeah, she is a big deal.

30:21.618 --> 30:24.553
Oh, weird, cool, cool.

30:24.555 --> 30:29.861
Yeah, um... She lives in the
same house she grew up in,

30:30.260 --> 30:32.062
which is kinda strange.

30:32.363 --> 30:34.899
- It's a nice house though.
- Yeah?

30:37.534 --> 30:40.205
So you have your own apartment,
that's pretty sweet.

30:40.537 --> 30:44.238
Yeah, right when I hit 18,
I was out. [chuckles]

30:44.240 --> 30:46.109
- I live with my brother.
- Cool.

30:48.011 --> 30:51.446
- So, South Carolina, huh?
- Uh-huh.

30:51.448 --> 30:55.620
- You shell shocked?
- What? Come on, that's pretty lame.

30:56.653 --> 30:59.891
Okay, you're right.
It is. Sorry.

31:02.660 --> 31:07.565
Um, my dad got a job there
once my mom died, so...

31:08.565 --> 31:10.602
Sorry. How old were you?

31:11.468 --> 31:15.473
- Like, eight.
- What does your dad do?

31:16.240 --> 31:18.609
I don't really know.
Financial stuff.

31:20.711 --> 31:24.182
- You get along?
- Um, no, not really.

31:25.148 --> 31:27.481
It's part of the reason why
I want to get away, honestly.

31:27.483 --> 31:32.890
He is, like, always home
and he's super depressed so...

31:34.290 --> 31:35.425
I hear that.

31:39.195 --> 31:41.395
- I thought you were working.
- [Jimmy] They sent me home.

31:41.397 --> 31:44.034
- [Tab] What's up, Katie?
- Is that Tab?

31:44.667 --> 31:46.535
What's going on?
It's like a Thursday.

31:46.537 --> 31:48.370
- Hanging out.
- Hi, no!

31:48.372 --> 31:51.476
- Put me down. No!
- Dude, put my sister down.

31:53.477 --> 31:55.113
- What's up?
- Hey.

31:55.412 --> 31:58.615
Um... This is Cyd. She's
visiting from South Carolina.

31:59.016 --> 32:02.487
South Carolina?
Isn't that... It's...

32:03.287 --> 32:07.125
I'm just gonna go change. We might go
up to the roof. My room is back here.

32:10.027 --> 32:12.263
- Nice pants, Kate.
- Fuck off!

32:16.633 --> 32:18.303
You can sit on the bed
if you want.

32:19.603 --> 32:22.373
Sorry, I don't have like...
a chair.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.547
Sorry about these guys.
They're pretty lame.

32:30.180 --> 32:32.115
- That's okay.
- Don't look.

32:32.782 --> 32:36.019
- Huh? Oh.
- Just kidding.

32:37.121 --> 32:38.556
You can look if you want to.

33:18.528 --> 33:20.298
[birds chirping]

33:36.413 --> 33:40.751
[wind rustling
through the trees]

33:54.397 --> 33:57.034
- Whoa!
- Yup.

34:02.372 --> 34:03.775
This is nice.

34:08.744 --> 34:10.213
[Male] Cut!

34:11.581 --> 34:14.585
- Are they making a movie?
- I guess so.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.487
So are you in college?

34:20.489 --> 34:23.326
Or is that coffee shop thing
that you want to do?

34:23.860 --> 34:27.230
[chuckles] Hell, no.
That is not what I want to do.

34:27.597 --> 34:31.333
I'm not in college yet. I'm taking
a break to figure shit out.

34:31.335 --> 34:32.835
So what do you want to do?

34:33.804 --> 34:35.672
I don't have a fucking clue.

34:37.739 --> 34:39.476
I wanna not rush things.

34:39.809 --> 34:41.110
That's what I want to do.

34:45.181 --> 34:46.616
So what about you?
What's your deal?

34:47.684 --> 34:50.621
Um... I play soccer...

34:51.621 --> 34:53.320
I hang out with my friends.
That's about it.

34:53.322 --> 34:54.458
- You play soccer?
- Yeah.

34:55.759 --> 34:57.295
That's fucking hot.

35:03.500 --> 35:04.566
[male] Hey!

35:04.568 --> 35:06.168
Oh, we'll get out of your way.

35:06.170 --> 35:07.568
[male] Oh, no, no, uh...

35:07.570 --> 35:09.771
This is gonna seem really weird
but we actually need

35:09.773 --> 35:12.641
a boy and a girl slow dancing
in the background.

35:12.643 --> 35:14.878
Would you guys
be willing to do that for us?

35:15.378 --> 35:16.614
- Actually...
- No, wait.

35:17.880 --> 35:19.716
- Uh, yeah. What do you want us to do?
- Oh, wow. Thank you.

35:19.949 --> 35:24.654
So, yeah, if you can get yourselves
at the center of the roof.

35:25.956 --> 35:27.822
Yeah, that's perfect.

35:27.824 --> 35:31.825
And now, I'm gonna shout action,
when I do, just be in love.

35:31.827 --> 35:33.230
You got it.

35:42.306 --> 35:43.574
Action!

36:20.710 --> 36:23.545
<i>So we did. We danced.</i>

36:23.547 --> 36:25.947
And they never knew
that the he was a she?

36:25.949 --> 36:27.418
No, I guess not.

36:29.385 --> 36:31.521
Well, maybe she is a he.

36:32.956 --> 36:33.891
Yeah, maybe so.

36:36.525 --> 36:40.829
- Guess what I did today?
- Um... Wrote an essay.

36:40.831 --> 36:43.731
- Shut up, no. I laid out.
- [Cyd laughs]

36:43.733 --> 36:45.034
Oh, my God! You did!

36:45.036 --> 36:49.539
I did! I, I did also write an
essay actually but I laid out.

36:49.773 --> 36:52.474
You did have a swimsuit.
You knew you did.

36:52.476 --> 36:54.608
I didn't. I had no idea.

36:54.610 --> 36:57.315
I didn't even remember, I had to
dig it out. It was, it was purple.

36:57.748 --> 37:01.383
And it fit! And that is a real
deal miracle, Miss Atheist.

37:01.385 --> 37:03.751
It is impossible that it fit.

37:03.753 --> 37:07.054
- I want to see it.
- Um, I'll show you tomorrow.

37:07.056 --> 37:09.893
We can get a little tan
before the soiree.

37:10.293 --> 37:12.459
Oh, God, I have to remember to
call the caterer tomorrow morning.

37:12.461 --> 37:13.931
Yeah, so wait.
What is this thing?

37:14.364 --> 37:19.603
Oh, right. Uh, so second Fridays
of every month I have a soiree.

37:19.869 --> 37:23.773
Academics, writers, church
friends, normal people and we...

37:24.340 --> 37:27.711
we eat, we get drunk,
we read, we, we tell stories.

37:28.411 --> 37:31.615
Hmm. I didn't bring anything to
wear to something like that.

37:31.882 --> 37:34.318
Well, that's okay.
It's totally casual. Um...

37:35.085 --> 37:36.954
I, I could take you shopping...

37:37.688 --> 37:40.322
tomorrow if you want,
we could get something cool.

37:40.324 --> 37:44.394
Nah, that's okay, thanks. I'll go to the
thrift store, ask Katie or something.

37:44.860 --> 37:46.730
- Can she come?
- Uh...

37:47.331 --> 37:48.532
- Sure.
- Cool.

37:51.867 --> 37:53.336
[sighs in content]

37:53.836 --> 37:57.474
Ugh... I hate my feet.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.478
Oh, you have nice feet.
Oh, God, look at mine.

38:01.344 --> 38:05.448
Let me see.
Yeah, but yours are prettier.

38:08.585 --> 38:10.688
- Oh, yeah. You're right, they are.
- [Cyd laughs]

38:11.621 --> 38:12.889
Whatever.

38:36.980 --> 38:40.885
[classical music playing]

38:53.096 --> 38:54.931
So what time does this thing
start tonight?

38:56.099 --> 39:00.601
Um... People usually start
showing up around six,

39:00.603 --> 39:02.706
doesn't really get going
until about seven.

39:03.606 --> 39:06.643
- Will Anthony be there?
- Always.

39:07.777 --> 39:10.814
[idyllic sounds of breeze
blowing and birds chirping]

39:13.717 --> 39:15.019
Do you ever have sex?

39:17.920 --> 39:18.989
What?

39:19.989 --> 39:22.657
- Do you ever have sex?
- Oh, I'm sorry is that...

39:22.659 --> 39:26.463
No, no, no, no it's okay.
It's... Wow.

39:28.063 --> 39:29.863
Um, sure, sure I do.

39:29.865 --> 39:31.065
- Really?
- Yeah.

39:31.067 --> 39:32.635
When? With who?

39:33.936 --> 39:36.873
- I have... I've had sex.
- Yeah, I know. We've established that.

39:37.673 --> 39:39.009
I'm just trying to think.

39:39.876 --> 39:42.443
- Aunt Miranda?
- What, I'm trying to think!

39:42.445 --> 39:43.713
It's been forever, hasn't it?

39:45.882 --> 39:49.519
Uh... Well, there was this...

39:53.590 --> 39:58.827
Uh, well, there was a guy at,
um... at a hotel...

39:58.829 --> 40:01.595
- Uh-huh.
- ...at a lit convention.

40:01.597 --> 40:03.030
In 1992.

40:03.032 --> 40:05.635
- No! Sorry. Sorry.
- Ow! [Cyd laughs]

40:10.172 --> 40:15.709
Yeah, but, uh... No, it's, it's...
It's been about five years.

40:15.711 --> 40:18.782
- What?
- Yeah. Shit.

40:19.682 --> 40:20.918
I was 11.

40:21.184 --> 40:22.720
Damn it!

40:24.688 --> 40:25.823
God!

40:26.755 --> 40:28.158
Well, I did... I had...

40:28.592 --> 40:31.492
I had a very... I had a
very long time boyfriend,

40:31.494 --> 40:34.431
so I wanna... I wanna put
that out there but...

40:35.764 --> 40:37.201
It didn't work out.

40:38.235 --> 40:42.039
That was that. And there
have been some other...

40:43.507 --> 40:46.076
There've been some other chaps
here and there but otherwise...

40:47.510 --> 40:49.646
So, you have no interest
in doing it again?

40:49.880 --> 40:50.981
Do what?

40:51.648 --> 40:53.751
I don't know, like, date.

40:56.085 --> 40:57.754
No. Not really.

40:58.688 --> 40:59.990
Um, sex?

41:02.192 --> 41:03.760
I don't know. Um...

41:06.161 --> 41:11.534
I, I... I really haven't thought
about it... to be honest.

41:12.202 --> 41:13.237
[chuckles]

41:17.541 --> 41:20.510
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yes, you may.

41:22.846 --> 41:25.181
I... kinda wanna
have sex with Katie.

41:29.085 --> 41:33.557
- What, is that weird?
- Not at all.

41:36.726 --> 41:37.795
How do I do it?

41:39.128 --> 41:43.199
How do you... do... Uh, don't ask me.
You have to google that.

41:45.268 --> 41:46.769
Okay. Will do.

41:48.003 --> 41:50.673
Yeah, your, your mom had a,
a little fling with a girl once.

41:51.574 --> 41:53.576
- Really, she did?
- Yeah.

41:56.579 --> 41:57.847
It was lovely.

42:01.016 --> 42:02.585
[creaking sound]

42:04.219 --> 42:05.622
[Ridley] Oh.

42:05.855 --> 42:08.789
Oh, God. Oh, my God. Hi!

42:08.791 --> 42:13.096
Hey, Ridley, I... I'm sorry. I... I
totally forgot that you were coming.

42:13.597 --> 42:14.996
Do you want me to not...

42:14.998 --> 42:19.603
No, no, no, no, you can do your thing.
Um, this is Cyd.

42:19.902 --> 42:22.003
She's gonna be staying
a couple of weeks with me.

42:22.005 --> 42:23.204
- Hey, Cyd.
- Hey.

42:23.206 --> 42:24.606
This is Ridley.

42:24.608 --> 42:27.842
He's the son of some very dear
friends of ours round the corner.

42:27.844 --> 42:29.943
So, and he sometimes comes
to second Fridays.

42:29.945 --> 42:31.378
Are you coming tonight?

42:31.380 --> 42:32.949
- Sure am.
- Good.

42:56.905 --> 42:58.074
Whose stuff is this?

42:58.675 --> 43:00.711
- Fucking Tab moved in.
- Why?

43:01.644 --> 43:04.815
- He lost his apartment I guess.
- Thanks.

43:09.351 --> 43:11.688
Honestly, I don't have much.

43:12.889 --> 43:16.126
Except for this one dress I used to
wear to church. You want to wear that?

43:17.193 --> 43:18.860
No offense, it's a little...

43:18.862 --> 43:20.994
- Yup, thought so.
- Sorry.

43:20.996 --> 43:24.300
Um... dressywise I don't really
have anything else.

43:25.434 --> 43:28.038
Except the tux I wore to prom.
Do you want to wear that?

43:35.411 --> 43:37.814
- You ready?
- Yeah.

43:42.818 --> 43:45.822
[Katie chuckles] Oh, my God!

43:47.824 --> 43:49.393
Hey, little lady,
what's your name?

44:16.286 --> 44:18.054
Are you sure you don't
want to come to the party?

44:19.956 --> 44:21.425
No, I'm good.

44:23.159 --> 44:24.361
Can I call you later?

44:25.762 --> 44:27.998
Please, please, pretty please.

44:29.833 --> 44:31.965
- Ooh...
- [Anthony] Hello! Hello!

44:31.967 --> 44:34.802
Oh, thank you so much
for bringing all that.

44:34.804 --> 44:37.106
Yeah, no problem.
You look very nice.

44:37.806 --> 44:42.679
Oh! Thank you. It's, um... It's
just this little... Thank you.

44:43.146 --> 44:45.349
- Is there more outside?
- Yeah. Lots.

44:45.849 --> 44:47.815
- Did you get some sun?
- What?

44:47.817 --> 44:51.954
Um... uh, yeah, I, I, I,
I laid out with...

44:53.188 --> 44:57.293
with Cyd in the grass and I,
I got some... I got some sun.

44:57.793 --> 44:58.929
Hmm.

45:21.016 --> 45:24.353
- Some music?
- Uh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

45:33.496 --> 45:37.034
[jazz music plays faintly]

45:50.480 --> 45:51.579
Where's Cyd?

45:51.581 --> 45:54.518
She went to see a friend
about an outfit.

45:55.418 --> 45:57.454
- A friend already?
- Uh-huh.

46:00.190 --> 46:01.425
A friend friend?

46:02.826 --> 46:05.362
[Anthony chuckles]

47:02.619 --> 47:05.086
[Miranda] Oh, wonderful
and how long were you there?

47:05.088 --> 47:07.054
[female guest] I had a week...

47:07.056 --> 47:09.092
Relaxing.
Such a great time of the year...

47:09.659 --> 47:10.925
[Miranda]
You can go to Princeton.

47:10.927 --> 47:12.525
[male]
Absolutely, yes.

47:12.527 --> 47:13.994
I mean, I think that's wonderful.
We have these

47:13.996 --> 47:16.399
East Coast connections...

47:17.666 --> 47:19.435
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:19.969 --> 47:22.371
- Is this okay?
- It's perfect.

47:23.039 --> 47:24.307
It's amazing...

47:25.407 --> 47:27.108
- Welcome.
- Thanks.

47:27.110 --> 47:28.608
Come on, let me
introduce you to everyone.

47:28.610 --> 47:31.112
- Oh, and this is my niece. This is Cyd.
- Hi.

47:31.114 --> 47:33.246
Cyd, this is Ms. Evergreen,
Anthony's mom.

47:33.248 --> 47:34.347
Hi, pleased to meet you.

47:34.349 --> 47:35.485
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

47:36.751 --> 47:38.619
- My friend Thompson.
- How're you doing? Good to meet you.

47:38.621 --> 47:41.021
- He is also at the university with us.
- Okay.

47:41.023 --> 47:42.990
- I'm Jack.
- Jack, pardon me.

47:42.992 --> 47:45.025
- Hi.
- Of course, and this is his wife.

47:45.027 --> 47:46.529
- Hi, Cyd.
- Hi.

47:48.030 --> 47:52.032
And of course,

We were rivals. She was a prosecutor.

That's so cool.

49:42.577 --> 49:43.577
Oh, we should also add
that I was married.

49:43.579 --> 49:45.345
Yes, so, in any case

49:45.347 --> 49:47.313
we knew we had to wait
until one of us retired

49:47.315 --> 49:49.349
so we could successfully
make a go at it.

49:49.351 --> 49:51.487
- [guest] You worked on the same case?
- Cases.

49:52.255 --> 49:53.423
That's incredible.

49:53.688 --> 49:54.921
So you were both married to men?

49:54.923 --> 49:58.659
Um, yes. I was a widow when we
met, I was a widow early on.

49:58.661 --> 50:02.699
Bettie was married, got divorced later.
That's where he came from.

50:03.800 --> 50:07.037
So you liked it and you didn't?

50:09.304 --> 50:10.539
What, being married to men?

50:12.175 --> 50:13.543
Are you asking if we like dick?

50:13.809 --> 50:15.411
[all choking with laughter]

50:15.677 --> 50:17.146
Um...

50:25.855 --> 50:28.255
I did. She didn't.

50:28.257 --> 50:29.559
I do.

50:33.663 --> 50:35.231
Dick is not terrible, is it?

50:35.565 --> 50:38.467
It's not terrible, it is like
the opposite of terrible.

50:40.836 --> 50:42.304
So what are you into, hon?

50:44.706 --> 50:47.641
Oh, um... I...

50:47.643 --> 50:51.481
like... everything.

50:55.585 --> 50:59.755
[Evergreen James] ...and he goes outside
to go on his little date to the dance

51:00.222 --> 51:03.490
and in two seconds,
he comes back in and he's like,

51:03.492 --> 51:07.427
"Mama, her parents left.
We need a ride."

51:07.429 --> 51:09.463
[Anthony] Right. I don't think
that's exactly what happened

51:09.465 --> 51:10.898
but whatever.

51:10.900 --> 51:14.434
Oh, shut up.
I drove you on all your dates.

51:14.436 --> 51:16.806
Yes, you did and I love you, Mama.
Thank you.

51:17.773 --> 51:20.644
I can drive you two,
if you wanna go somewhere.

51:24.547 --> 51:25.648
Wow.

51:30.686 --> 51:32.655
Where's J?
Thought he was coming home.

51:33.188 --> 51:35.257
- He got himself a date.
- Really?

51:35.625 --> 51:36.760
Uh-hmm.

51:38.460 --> 51:40.629
- Some girl at work.
- Weird.

51:41.597 --> 51:42.799
We were supposed to hang out.

51:43.498 --> 51:44.767
How are you?

51:47.536 --> 51:50.172
- Fine. How are you?
- I'm good.

51:50.706 --> 51:55.211
I'm sorry for making fun of you in
front of your friend the other day,

51:55.844 --> 51:58.781
when I like picked you up
and spun you around.

51:59.248 --> 52:01.818
- So what are you up to tonight?
- Don't know.

52:02.617 --> 52:04.453
Let me know if
you wanna hang out.

52:05.188 --> 52:07.423
Uh... okay.

52:09.391 --> 52:13.163
[people speaking on television]

52:14.362 --> 52:15.662
[female guest] <i>This is a story</i>

52:15.664 --> 52:18.768
about a woman who burnt
her own house down.

52:19.202 --> 52:22.869
- Not true. Okay.
- No, sir. [laughs] This is very true.

52:22.871 --> 52:26.408
- Okay, okay.
- This is very, very true. 1968.

52:26.708 --> 52:29.411
- Cincinnati, Ohio...
- Mmm, no, no, no cellphones.

52:29.711 --> 52:32.349
- Oh, sorry.
- [crowd murmurs]

52:32.547 --> 52:35.384
Sweet... sweet Cincinnati.

52:36.351 --> 52:40.723
Dolores... mother of four, worked
for the Ohio insurance company.

52:41.623 --> 52:44.226
Husband left her
for another woman.

52:45.293 --> 52:48.498
Left her alone in that house
with four children.

52:48.998 --> 52:50.666
Three boys, one girl.

52:51.701 --> 52:53.503
One day,
someone knocks on her door.

52:53.936 --> 52:57.807
She opens it to find a very nice
seeming young man standing there.

52:58.407 --> 53:02.245
He is new to town. Works for the paper.
Looking to rent a place.

53:03.246 --> 53:05.012
Money is tight for them, see?

53:05.014 --> 53:07.313
So she moves into
her daughter's bedroom,

53:07.315 --> 53:09.516
gives the nice young man
the nice room

53:09.518 --> 53:11.454
just till he gets off
the ground here.

53:12.021 --> 53:14.758
Good Christian man.
Not a concern in the world.

53:16.559 --> 53:20.597
Couple of days later, she catches word
a woman in Columbus was murdered.

53:20.862 --> 53:23.567
- [all] Ooh.
- By a devil worshiper.

53:23.766 --> 53:25.733
[all] Woo!

53:25.735 --> 53:28.001
- And he got away.
- [elderly female] Woo! Oh, dear.

53:28.003 --> 53:30.470
Oh, don't worry.
I don't think it's true.

53:30.472 --> 53:32.305
What... did you say?

53:32.307 --> 53:33.574
[all laughing]

53:33.576 --> 53:37.447
I said, "Yeah, you know, I think
I read about that somewhere."

53:39.447 --> 53:40.516
Damn right.

53:40.983 --> 53:42.318
Is she okay?

53:43.519 --> 53:44.686
Yeah, she's, uh, just pregnant
so she's really sensitive.

53:44.688 --> 53:49.690
- Whoa! Hey! Congratulations!
- [female] Congratulations!

53:49.692 --> 53:51.958
No! No...

53:51.960 --> 53:54.697
- I didn't. It just came out.
- Bravo.

53:55.530 --> 53:57.333
Congratulations.

53:57.800 --> 54:00.237
- Should we tell them what it's gonna be?
- No! Zip it!

54:04.907 --> 54:06.639
"There's a certain
slant of light,

54:06.641 --> 54:09.378
winter afternoons,
that oppresses,

54:09.778 --> 54:11.681
like the heft
of cathedral tunes...

54:12.882 --> 54:14.483
Heavenly hurt, it gives us.

54:14.849 --> 54:18.788
We can find no scar,
but internal difference,

54:19.588 --> 54:21.324
where the meanings are.

54:22.358 --> 54:24.027
None may teach it, any.

- Yeah.

54:46.382 --> 54:50.019
I have... a memory, an impression
when I read this poem.

54:50.853 --> 54:53.519
Did you ever get the feeling
when you were a child

54:53.521 --> 54:57.793
the end of August when the first
little chill comes in the evening,

54:58.027 --> 55:02.298
- and you're thinking, "School starts"?
- [all laugh]

55:02.731 --> 55:04.430
End of summer blues.

55:04.432 --> 55:07.367
"Behind what we think of
as the Russian menace

55:07.369 --> 55:10.440
lies what we do not wish to face
when they regard a negro.

55:11.072 --> 55:14.943
Reality, the fact that life
is tragic.

55:15.844 --> 55:18.711
Life is tragic simply because
the earth turns

55:18.713 --> 55:21.016
and the sun inexorably
rises and sets,

55:21.983 --> 55:23.853
and one day, for each of us,

55:24.519 --> 55:27.791
the sun will go down
for the last, last time.

55:29.023 --> 55:32.394
Perhaps the whole root of our
trouble, the human trouble,

55:32.628 --> 55:36.662
is that we will sacrifice
all the beauty of our lives,

55:36.664 --> 55:38.802
will imprison ourselves
in totems,

55:39.568 --> 55:41.071
taboos, crosses,

55:41.570 --> 55:44.740
blood sacrifices, steeples,
mosques, races,

55:44.940 --> 55:47.110
armies, flags, nations

55:47.610 --> 55:50.380
in order to deny
the fact of death.

55:50.880 --> 55:52.749
The only fact we have.

55:53.548 --> 55:57.885
It seems to me that one ought to
rejoice in the fact of death,

55:57.887 --> 56:01.088
ought to decide indeed
to earn one's death

56:01.090 --> 56:04.525
by confronting with passion
the conundrum of life..."

56:04.527 --> 56:07.764
"We sat looking off across the
country watching the sun go down.

56:08.597 --> 56:11.134
The curly grass about us
was on fire now,

56:12.168 --> 56:14.838
the bark of the oaks
turned red as copper,

56:15.103 --> 56:17.539
there was a shimmer of gold
on the brown river,

56:18.440 --> 56:21.474
out in the stream, the
sandbars glittered like glass

56:21.476 --> 56:23.913
and the light trembled
in the willow thickets

were leaping among them.

snow falling faintly through the universe,

and faintly falling like the
descent of their last end

upon all the living
and the dead."

- What the fuck, man?

56:54.943 --> 56:57.146
I was wondering if you wanted to
sit on the bed with me.

56:57.713 --> 57:00.046
It's not that, it's a couch.
Get the fuck out of my room.

57:00.048 --> 57:02.552
- Couch, yeah.
- No, get the fuck out of here.

57:03.818 --> 57:05.721
- Come sit on the couch...
- Tab!

57:08.657 --> 57:09.992
Get out of my room!

57:12.994 --> 57:16.195
I thought I'd share a little bit
of nature from Ralph Waldo Emerson

57:16.197 --> 57:18.434
on this lovely summer evening.

57:21.036 --> 57:23.873
"To speak truly,
few adult persons can see nature

57:25.273 --> 57:27.609
At least they have
a very superficial seeing.

57:29.210 --> 57:32.045
The sun illuminates only
the eye of the man,

57:32.047 --> 57:35.652
but shines into the eye
and the heart of the child.

57:37.686 --> 57:40.954
The lover of nature is he
whose inward and outward senses

57:40.956 --> 57:43.760
are still truly adjusted
to each other;

57:44.293 --> 57:48.965
who has retained the spirit of infancy
even into the era of manhood.”

57:50.900 --> 57:55.137
His intercourse with heaven and earth,
becomes part of his daily food.

Crossing a bare common, in snow puddles,
at twilight, under a clouded sky,

58:02.277 --> 58:06.313
without having in my thoughts any
occurrence of a special good fortune,

58:06.315 --> 58:09.918
I have enjoyed
a perfect exhilaration.

58:10.753 --> 58:13.122
I am glad to the brink of fear.

58:14.657 --> 58:18.561
In the woods too,
a man casts off his years,

58:18.960 --> 58:22.229
and at what period

58:22.231 --> 58:23.733
soever of life,

58:24.699 --> 58:26.502
is always a child.

58:28.237 --> 58:30.706
In the woods,
is perpetual youth."

- Okay, okay, okay, I'll do it again.

That might've been a tie.

- Oh, thank you for having us.

- Wonderful meeting you.
- And you as well, thank you.

you can come back next month.

- Yeah.

are looking for you.

- Hi.
- Hey!

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:48.711
- Where'd you disappear to?
- I was upstairs.

01:00:50.846 --> 01:00:52.648
I think Aunt Miranda
is mad at me.

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:54.917
She'll get over it.

01:00:57.753 --> 01:00:59.418
She was telling me
about your son.

01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:02.692
Yeah, he's something else.

01:01:04.927 --> 01:01:07.764
She also said
you were technically married.

01:01:08.797 --> 01:01:11.668
Oh, you just got the whole
rundown, didn't you? [chuckles]

01:01:12.233 --> 01:01:14.936
Uh, true. Um, separated.

01:01:16.137 --> 01:01:18.137
We're through
the thick of it though.

01:01:18.139 --> 01:01:19.773
You're getting back together?

01:01:19.775 --> 01:01:21.807
No, no, no, no, I mean, um,

01:01:21.809 --> 01:01:25.278
like through the initial
burst of it all.

01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:28.148
Yeah, we're moving forward

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:30.753
and Brandon's been
a real saint about it.

01:01:34.389 --> 01:01:38.361
So... maybe once
the dust settles you could...

01:01:40.262 --> 01:01:43.399
I mean... would you ever
consider dating Miranda?

01:01:46.434 --> 01:01:49.101
Anthony, did you want to take
home those cream cheese things...

01:01:49.103 --> 01:01:50.269
- Yeah.
- ...for you and Brandon.

01:01:50.271 --> 01:01:52.375
Yeah, let me come in
and grab those.

01:01:54.143 --> 01:01:55.344
All right.

01:02:41.389 --> 01:02:43.055
Pretty crazy.

01:02:43.057 --> 01:02:45.128
- Did you have fun?
- Yeah.

01:02:45.427 --> 01:02:46.996
Everyone was super nice.

01:02:47.862 --> 01:02:49.095
Can I help you clean up?

01:02:49.097 --> 01:02:53.133
Um, sure, if we can just get
everything in...

01:02:53.135 --> 01:02:55.467
this general vicinity.

01:02:55.469 --> 01:02:57.570
We can deal with it tomorrow.
I'm pretty exhausted.

01:02:57.572 --> 01:03:01.243
Yeah, me too.
I'll check the back porch.

01:03:05.614 --> 01:03:09.152
It was cool to hear everybody
read and swap all the stories.

01:03:09.351 --> 01:03:11.150
- And you like that?
- Yeah.

01:03:11.152 --> 01:03:14.956
I liked that one, uh, story
that that one woman told...

01:03:15.556 --> 01:03:18.894
- Um, Cornelia.
- Yeah, was it true?

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:20.962
Probably not.

01:03:25.099 --> 01:03:26.402
I liked yours.

01:03:27.235 --> 01:03:29.371
- My what?
- That thing you read.

01:03:30.873 --> 01:03:34.210
Oh, the part you heard?
Well, there was more.

01:03:37.112 --> 01:03:39.079
Yeah, I'm sorry. I...

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:40.249
It's fine...

01:03:42.451 --> 01:03:44.887
It is... No, it's okay... It...

01:03:46.288 --> 01:03:48.454
No, I don't wanna be
that relative that's...

01:03:48.456 --> 01:03:50.657
It's... It's really more
about the smoke.

01:03:50.659 --> 01:03:53.994
I just, I don't like it in the
house, and I, it's not...

01:03:53.996 --> 01:03:55.030
I'm sorry.

01:03:57.199 --> 01:03:59.034
It's okay, really, it's...

01:04:00.534 --> 01:04:02.337
- It's fine.
- Okay.

01:04:04.005 --> 01:04:07.007
Do you want anything else
before I put this food away?

01:04:07.009 --> 01:04:09.010
No, thanks. I'm good.

01:04:09.277 --> 01:04:12.581
- Um, I'm gonna call Katie.
- Okay.

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:19.119
Oh, I might... have half a
piece more of Anna May's cake.

01:04:19.121 --> 01:04:20.423
You sure you don't want
some cake?

01:04:21.289 --> 01:04:22.525
No, thanks.

01:04:23.692 --> 01:04:25.624
You know, maybe if you had sex
once in a while,

01:04:25.626 --> 01:04:27.362
you wouldn't want
to eat all the time.

01:04:32.467 --> 01:04:34.967
I'm really sorry.
That came out super nasty.

01:04:34.969 --> 01:04:36.168
Let me just say something
real quick.

01:04:36.170 --> 01:04:37.472
- I really am sorry.
- No, no, no, no.

01:04:38.139 --> 01:04:40.076
That's okay but I need you
to listen to me, okay?

01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:43.278
Yeah, I wish that I could...

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:47.380
I could share with you
the utter joy it brings me

01:04:47.382 --> 01:04:50.052
to spend three hours
on a Saturday afternoon reading

01:04:50.452 --> 01:04:54.156
Emerson or Melville
or Virginia Woolf...

01:04:55.056 --> 01:04:57.490
or discussing T. S. Elliot
or James Baldwin

01:04:57.492 --> 01:04:59.262
with a dear friend until dawn.

01:05:00.695 --> 01:05:04.599
The fulfillment that I get
from going to church,

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:11.039
from reading theology, from
reading science, from praying...

01:05:13.141 --> 01:05:16.913
but I can't... because I am me

01:05:17.445 --> 01:05:19.045
and you are you.

01:05:19.047 --> 01:05:21.280
I can't relate to you
the total fulfillment

01:05:21.282 --> 01:05:23.551
that I get from these things.
It's impossible.

01:05:25.186 --> 01:05:26.221
I know...

01:05:27.255 --> 01:05:29.591
And I understand,
you're finding your own joy.

01:05:30.625 --> 01:05:34.327
You're engaging your own stuff,
that's great.

01:05:34.329 --> 01:05:37.500
That's how it should be
and it's a beautiful thing.

01:05:39.768 --> 01:05:41.103
But hear me.

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:44.941
It is not a handicap...

01:05:45.239 --> 01:05:47.976
to have one thing
but not another.

01:05:49.077 --> 01:05:51.514
To be one way and not another.

01:05:53.648 --> 01:05:59.119
We are different shapes and ways
and our happiness is unique.

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:01.456
There are no rules of balance.

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:05.661
- I'm sorry...
- Don't be sorry.

01:06:07.695 --> 01:06:09.965
But I got a quarter of a century
on you, Cyd.

01:06:11.333 --> 01:06:14.470
So, let's just...
enjoy ourselves.

01:06:16.204 --> 01:06:18.074
Okay? Let's just thank...

01:06:19.574 --> 01:06:21.677
respect each other's selves.

01:06:24.713 --> 01:06:26.082
Hey, stop talking.

01:06:27.648 --> 01:06:29.085
I guess I just feel like...

01:06:30.418 --> 01:06:31.084
Are we done in here? 'Cause I
really need to be done in here.

01:06:31.086 --> 01:06:32.688
Did you get all the bottles?

01:06:33.922 --> 01:06:36.224
- Yeah, everything's cleared.
- Okay, thank you for helping.

01:06:36.724 --> 01:06:38.626
- I'm gonna go upstairs.
- Okay.

01:07:05.186 --> 01:07:06.422
Miranda!

01:07:15.362 --> 01:07:17.563
You don't have to come. I'll
just call you when I get out.

01:07:17.565 --> 01:07:18.634
No, I'm coming.

01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:22.168
Uh, she wanted me to text her,
not to buzz her.

01:07:22.170 --> 01:07:23.271
Okay.

01:07:25.474 --> 01:07:26.776
[knocking]

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:33.481
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
Are you okay?

01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:37.650
I'm sorry. I didn't mean...

01:07:37.652 --> 01:07:38.820
Let us in.

01:07:46.293 --> 01:07:47.295
Are you okay?

01:07:51.365 --> 01:07:54.737
Um... He finally passed out.

01:07:57.139 --> 01:08:00.476
- What happened to his nose?
- I punched him.

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:04.644
I'm sorry to make you come over.
I feel so stupid.

01:08:04.646 --> 01:08:06.315
Don't be silly. Are you okay?

01:08:07.449 --> 01:08:09.518
- Yeah.
- Katie?

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:12.488
Are you okay?

01:08:13.588 --> 01:08:15.191
- Yeah.
- Did he hurt you?

01:08:15.856 --> 01:08:18.661
I... tried to go out and
he wouldn't let me leave.

01:08:19.161 --> 01:08:20.462
He was acting really weird.

01:08:21.828 --> 01:08:23.430
I don't want him to wake up.

01:08:24.298 --> 01:08:25.568
You can probably go, it's fine.

01:08:26.902 --> 01:08:28.170
No, you should go get your things.
You're gonna come with us.

01:08:47.854 --> 01:08:49.157
[Tab gasps]

01:08:55.828 --> 01:08:57.265

Cyd...

[Cyd sobs]

01:09:08.877 --> 01:09:11.747
Cyd! Cyd!

01:09:23.890 --> 01:09:26.194
- I'm Miranda.
- Katie.

01:10:02.430 --> 01:10:05.967
- Cool room.
- Thanks. It was my mom's.

01:10:14.009 --> 01:10:17.413
Read it. Read it.

01:10:19.948 --> 01:10:21.217
Read it.

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:23.851
- Read it.
- Wait. Really?

01:10:24.653 --> 01:10:25.820
Yeah, why?

01:10:27.087 --> 01:10:29.891
I don't know, I guess... you
don't really seem like a reader.

01:10:30.591 --> 01:10:32.728
Fuck you, what does a reader
even seem like?

01:10:34.762 --> 01:10:36.332
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

01:10:38.966 --> 01:10:41.836
Holy shit, your aunt wrote this?
I read this in middle school.

01:10:42.470 --> 01:10:43.572
What?

01:10:49.810 --> 01:10:51.613
Wait a minute. I know that book.

01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.582
Wait, Aunt Miranda wrote that?

01:10:55.015 --> 01:10:56.684
Uh, yeah.

01:10:57.085 --> 01:11:00.053
Is that the one about the baby
born in a castle...

01:11:00.055 --> 01:11:01.720
The hotel that used to be
a castle, yeah.

01:11:01.722 --> 01:11:04.089
And her parents treat her like
a princess and she

01:11:04.091 --> 01:11:05.525
starts to develop powers...

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:08.727
Yeah, and she thinks she's magic and
you don't know if it's real or not.

01:11:08.729 --> 01:11:09.897
Kind of bad ass.

01:11:17.905 --> 01:11:19.841
- What?
- My name.

01:11:22.510 --> 01:11:25.948
- That would be correct.
- Wait a minute, let me see that.

- Hi.
- Is she okay?

01:11:54.842 --> 01:11:56.878
Yeah. She'll be okay.

01:11:57.378 --> 01:12:00.748
- You okay?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

01:12:01.515 --> 01:12:03.751
Okay. Good.

01:12:06.621 --> 01:12:08.390
[chuckles] Well...

01:12:10.457 --> 01:12:12.493
My mom used to read this to me,
didn't she?

01:12:13.895 --> 01:12:15.030
She did.

01:12:15.896 --> 01:12:17.899
You were way too young for it.

01:12:18.932 --> 01:12:20.601
You fell asleep every time.

01:12:22.103 --> 01:12:25.707
Well, she did it anyway though.
She did it for herself.

01:12:28.076 --> 01:12:29.345
She loved that book.

01:12:35.582 --> 01:12:36.851
You named her after me?

01:12:40.054 --> 01:12:41.090
Check the date.

01:12:48.162 --> 01:12:49.630

- [sounds of girls moaning]

01:19:46.447 --> 01:19:47.516
Devin.

01:19:50.283 --> 01:19:52.520
He was like
12 years older than me.

01:19:57.490 --> 01:19:59.592
He had a lot of mental problems

01:19:59.594 --> 01:20:01.863
or whatever and just
a lot of issues.

01:20:03.864 --> 01:20:06.333
And he and my mom and my dad
used to get...

01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:09.104
into these really big fights.

01:20:13.506 --> 01:20:17.144
They thought about sending him away
to military school or whatever but...

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:20.015
they never did.

01:20:26.887 --> 01:20:27.922
Anyway...

01:20:29.422 --> 01:20:33.260
One weekend when I was really
little and my dad was away...

01:20:34.462 --> 01:20:36.298
and after I'd gone to bed...

01:20:37.064 --> 01:20:41.036
my brother and my mom got into
this really big fight and...

01:20:42.302 --> 01:20:43.337
um...

01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:47.242

Somehow I slept through
the whole thing.

01:21:07.627 --> 01:21:10.998

before I could so I was...

01:22:06.020 --> 01:22:07.389
I'm not that big.

01:22:08.622 --> 01:22:11.126
Well, maybe, just a little.

01:22:11.391 --> 01:22:14.162
[cellphone buzzing]

01:22:15.162 --> 01:22:18.300
Hello? What?

01:22:20.734 --> 01:22:24.305
Okay? Are you sure?

01:22:25.573 --> 01:22:26.942
It's okay.

01:22:27.507 --> 01:22:30.679
Uh, well, I'll come home soon.

01:22:32.113 --> 01:22:34.149
[moderator] <i>Why don't we start
with a simple question.</i>

01:22:35.783 --> 01:22:38.553
Are there any simple questions?
I don't think those exist.

01:22:39.453 --> 01:22:41.222
Where do your ideas come from?

01:22:43.791 --> 01:22:46.125
You would think
that I would have a quick

01:22:46.127 --> 01:22:48.463
straightforward answer
to that by now,

01:22:50.264 --> 01:22:51.266
but I don't.

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:58.373
You know, I'm tempted to give the
standard... answer that they...

01:22:59.372 --> 01:23:02.242
They come from everywhere. They
come from different places...

01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:06.747
A feeling of relative...

01:23:07.814 --> 01:23:12.219
a place, other works of art,
a concern...

01:23:13.621 --> 01:23:16.358
What kind of concern would give
way to an idea for a book?

01:23:20.627 --> 01:23:23.430
A concern of the spirit,
I guess.

01:23:25.832 --> 01:23:27.268
A kind of unrest.

01:23:32.672 --> 01:23:36.176
But I suppose if I'm being
completely honest...

01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:39.611
uh, I can't say
that in their essence

01:23:39.613 --> 01:23:43.485
that they come from
outside at all.

01:23:45.618 --> 01:23:47.521
They come from me.

01:23:49.457 --> 01:23:51.393
They are... me.

01:23:52.693 --> 01:23:56.797
Each one of them...
sort of... me...

01:23:59.233 --> 01:24:00.435
Reformed.

01:24:02.036 --> 01:24:06.673
And I was working at the library when I
discovered your book of short stories.

01:24:08.309 --> 01:24:12.680
The title of which just fell out
of my head, I'm sorry.

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:16.350
- <i>The Valley of Their Shadows.</i>
- That's the one, thank you.

01:24:17.384 --> 01:24:21.155
There were some about those women that...
gave me strength.

01:24:22.189 --> 01:24:27.494
How thoughtful, how engaged with
the bigger picture or something...

01:24:28.595 --> 01:24:32.099
going through life
with such patience...

01:24:33.367 --> 01:24:34.569
and curiosity...

01:24:35.703 --> 01:24:39.074
despite seemingly
relentless hardship...

01:24:39.606 --> 01:24:43.677
It reminded me of the women in my life...
who I love... a lot.

01:24:44.545 --> 01:24:46.081
My grandmother recently...

01:24:50.850 --> 01:24:52.416
I don't have a question
apparently,

01:24:52.418 --> 01:24:54.555
uh, I guess I just wanted
to thank you...

01:24:55.288 --> 01:24:56.858
for honoring them.

01:24:57.457 --> 01:25:00.394
Well, thank you.
That... that means a lot.

01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:04.432
Anyone else?
We have time for one more.

01:25:13.306 --> 01:25:16.543
[Cyd giggling] Thank you.

01:25:18.444 --> 01:25:21.682
- Hi! Wow!
- Hello, young lady.

01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:26.521
That's my aunt. My aunt Miranda.

01:25:27.488 --> 01:25:30.522
Um, anyway, I...

01:25:30.524 --> 01:25:34.762
I wanted to ask you what your
greatest pleasure in life is.

01:25:35.296 --> 01:25:37.164
Like... joy?

01:25:39.934 --> 01:25:41.336
Cake.

01:25:48.208 --> 01:25:51.179
[peppy rock music playing]

01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:09.197
There they are.

01:26:09.697 --> 01:26:11.362
- Welcome, ladies!
- Thank you.

01:26:11.364 --> 01:26:12.798
- Hi.
- [laughs] Hey, how're you?

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.499
- Good, how are you?
- Hey, Cyd.

01:26:14.501 --> 01:26:16.268
- Hi.
- Cyd, of course you know,

01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:17.969
- and her friend Katie.
- Hey, how're you, Katie.

01:26:17.971 --> 01:26:20.908
Uh, well, uh, help yourselves,
we got food...

01:26:21.307 --> 01:26:25.677
drinks, we got good people,
good weather... Hey, Brandon!

01:26:25.679 --> 01:26:27.782
- What?
- Who you calling what?

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:32.951
Come over here, this is Miranda's
niece, Cyd, that's her friend, Katie.

01:26:32.953 --> 01:26:36.423
- Hi, sweetheart. How's your summer going?
- Good.

01:26:39.592 --> 01:26:41.695
He's 14. He's 14. He's 14.

01:26:42.363 --> 01:26:44.396
[neighbor] Hey, you guys,
let me take your picture.

01:26:44.398 --> 01:26:45.867
Yeah, yeah, sure. Come on.

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:48.469
Let's all squeeze in tight here.

01:26:48.935 --> 01:26:50.736
Cheese!

01:26:50.738 --> 01:26:52.937
- Got it.
- Thank you. Hey, let's get a bite.

01:26:52.939 --> 01:26:55.773
Look, I got hamburger,
I got chicken,

01:26:55.775 --> 01:26:59.880
I got Polish sausage,
got chicken bots...

01:27:05.351 --> 01:27:06.854
Hey, how's the grub?

01:27:07.453 --> 01:27:09.957
Burger overcooked...
Oh, you got the hotdog.

01:27:10.556 --> 01:27:13.424
Well, hotdog is excellent, I can't
really speak for the burger.

01:27:13.426 --> 01:27:15.229
Yeah, I can. They're overcooked.

01:27:15.828 --> 01:27:17.965
- Um, fuck it.
- Fuck it.

01:27:26.073 --> 01:27:28.910
You were right, by the way,
the other day.

01:27:29.976 --> 01:27:31.311
About what?

01:27:31.612 --> 01:27:34.012
Um, part two and three...

01:27:34.014 --> 01:27:36.351
read back through it,
what you said kinda clicked.

01:27:36.850 --> 01:27:37.919
Oh, good.

01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:40.788
Well, as long as it's for
the book and not for me.

01:27:41.387 --> 01:27:43.524
Oh, you know I do it all
for you, don't you?

01:27:48.362 --> 01:27:51.929
Hey, I gotta go pick up my brother
from work. Watch Priscilla for me?

01:27:51.931 --> 01:27:54.433
Yeah, sure.
Isa, do you know Miranda?

01:27:54.435 --> 01:27:57.635
I think we may have met
once or twice at a UFC thing.

01:27:57.637 --> 01:28:00.738
- But hi, nice to meet you. I'm Isabelle.
- Miranda, nice to meet you.

01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:02.874
I'm actually a fan,
love the new one.

01:28:02.876 --> 01:28:04.476
Oh, thank you so much.

01:28:04.478 --> 01:28:05.980
Definitely, thank you.

01:28:06.512 --> 01:28:08.946
- Don't let 'em get into too much trouble.
- Define trouble?

01:28:08.948 --> 01:28:10.751
Oh, shut up.

01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:14.919
She's lovely.

01:28:14.921 --> 01:28:18.458
She lives around the corner.
That's her little girl.

01:28:24.430 --> 01:28:25.599
Divorced?

01:28:26.432 --> 01:28:27.534
Yeah.

01:28:29.403 --> 01:28:31.939
So is there...
any potential there?

01:28:45.752 --> 01:28:46.920
We'll see.

01:28:49.622 --> 01:28:52.759
Hey, no, no, no, no. That's
not for playing with. Hey!

01:28:58.097 --> 01:28:59.966
Maybe you should
visit me sometime.

01:29:01.033 --> 01:29:03.637
- Seriously?
- Yeah, why not?

01:29:03.970 --> 01:29:05.539
What would your dad think?

01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:08.009
Who cares?

01:29:09.842 --> 01:29:12.979
Columbia, South Carolina.
What's it like?

01:29:14.581 --> 01:29:17.051
It's fine. Come and see.

01:29:18.551 --> 01:29:21.588
[Brandon]
Hey! Are y'all girlfriends?

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:26.828
Maybe so.

01:29:29.630 --> 01:29:30.797
Cool.

01:29:31.998 --> 01:29:33.835
Yeah, they are!

01:29:49.015 --> 01:29:52.819
[sounds of waves crashing,
seagulls calling]

01:29:58.692 --> 01:30:00.795
[phone ringing]

01:30:07.935 --> 01:30:11.105
[cellphone rings]

01:30:13.172 --> 01:30:14.175
Hello?

01:30:15.042 --> 01:30:17.011
- Cyd?
- <i>Yeah, who's this?</i>

01:30:18.912 --> 01:30:20.114
It's Miranda.

01:30:21.113 --> 01:30:23.682
- Oh, hey, you're calling me!
- [Miranda laughs]

01:30:23.684 --> 01:30:24.918
<i>I am.</i>

01:30:26.185 --> 01:30:29.023
I just, I wanted to, uh, to
check in and see how you were.

01:30:29.722 --> 01:30:33.427
I'm at the beach
with my toes in the sand.

01:30:34.994 --> 01:30:36.163
Oh, that sounds nice.

01:30:36.930 --> 01:30:38.466
[coach] Okay, girls, let's go.

01:30:38.698 --> 01:30:40.902
<i>Oh, am I calling you at a,
at a bad time?</i>

01:30:41.100 --> 01:30:45.836
Um... No, it's okay, I've soccer practice.
Uh, it's about to start.

01:30:45.838 --> 01:30:49.808
Oh, okay, uh, all right, well,
you go and play your heart out

01:30:49.810 --> 01:30:52.110
and I just,
I just called to say hello.

01:30:52.112 --> 01:30:54.815
- <i>Yeah, thanks for calling.</i>
- Of course.

01:30:56.149 --> 01:31:00.488
I miss you... I love you.

01:31:07.127 --> 01:31:08.793
I love you too.

01:31:08.795 --> 01:31:10.698
<i>Okay, well, have,
have a great practice.</i>

01:31:11.931 --> 01:31:12.897
I'll talk to you later.

01:31:12.899 --> 01:31:16.136
Okay, that sounds good.
All right, bye-bye.

01:31:16.603 --> 01:31:18.605
- Bye.
