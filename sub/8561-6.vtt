02:29.376 --> 02:34.999
When we left for Bastogne,
we were short of equipment.

02:35.215 --> 02:39.343
We didn't have enough ammunition
or warm clothes.

02:39.594 --> 02:42.928
But we had confidence…

02:43.098 --> 02:48.518
that our higher military authorities
would get to us whatever we needed.

02:48.770 --> 02:52.719
There was a ridge with a tree line.
We were dug in there.

02:52.899 --> 02:57.395
The Germans knew where we were
and they gave us a shellacking.

02:57.612 --> 03:02.439
In Bastogne we were down to
one round per man there for a while.

03:02.658 --> 03:05.991
The fog was in.
They couldn't resupply us.

03:06.245 --> 03:08.996
When they tried to drop supplies in…

03:09.206 --> 03:12.575
they'd miss and drop them
to the Germans.

03:12.835 --> 03:17.413
One guy got hit by shrapnel.
Took his arm off above the elbow.

03:17.589 --> 03:21.966
They were taking him out and he said,
“Get my watch off my arm”.

03:22.177 --> 03:25.628
A medic came along
and he really saved my life.

03:25.889 --> 03:31.642
He stuck a Syrette in a key position.
Morphine.

03:31.895 --> 03:36.640
Even today on a real cold night,
when we go to bed…

03:36.858 --> 03:41.982
the first thing I'll say is,
“I'm glad I'm not in Bastogne”.

06:00.204 --> 06:02.742
Doc, doc, doc.

07:07.602 --> 07:12.264
Doc, bandage.
Take him back to Regiment.

07:14.234 --> 07:18.812
–Gen. McAuliffe, division commander.
–Give it to me straight.

07:18.988 --> 07:23.401
We've been taking ground in
one position, losing it in another.

07:23.576 --> 07:27.325
Now we're digging in
on the edge of the forest.

07:27.580 --> 07:32.954
We're under sporadic artillery fire.
We're taking hits with no aid station.

07:33.210 --> 07:36.793
We have no food or winter clothes,
and little ammo.

07:37.047 --> 07:41.259
The line's spread so thin
the enemy wanders into our CP.

07:41.510 --> 07:43.835
We just can't cover the line.

07:44.012 --> 07:48.639
Morning, Captain Nixon.
You got anything for Gen. McAuliffe?

07:49.268 --> 07:51.509
Yes, sir.

07:51.770 --> 07:57.974
General, I took a walk on our line
about 0300 last night.

07:58.235 --> 08:01.438
I couldn't find the 501st
on our right flank.

08:01.654 --> 08:05.023
We've got considerable gaps
in our perimeter.

08:05.283 --> 08:09.281
I don't have enough people, sir.
We're spread too thin.

08:09.495 --> 08:12.781
Hold the line, colonel.
Close the gaps.

08:13.040 --> 08:17.998
This fog won't lift anytime soon,
so you can forget about air cover.

08:18.254 --> 08:21.753
1st Battalion just left Foy,
Krauts on their tail.

08:22.007 --> 08:28.591
Tanks. Artillery. Got no backup.
There's a lot of shit headed this way.

08:44.404 --> 08:46.147
Doc?

08:46.406 --> 08:49.857
Can I scrounge a bandage
from your aid kit, sir?

08:50.118 --> 08:52.573
How are you fixed?

08:52.829 --> 08:56.957
No plasma, couple of bandages,
practically no morphine.

08:57.208 --> 09:01.158
I tried to find my way up
to 3rd Battalion for supplies…

09:01.420 --> 09:03.460
but I lost my way.

09:03.631 --> 09:05.837
If you can't get over to 3rd…

09:06.050 --> 09:09.549
Doc Ryan will fix you up
with what he can spare.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.380
Thanks, captain.

09:13.307 --> 09:18.847
Eugene? Get everything you can.
You're gonna need it.

09:23.025 --> 09:24.602
–Spina.
–Doc.

09:24.860 --> 09:28.525
–What's happening?
–We're digging in along the line.

09:28.697 --> 09:32.741
Yeah, this is it.
So, what'd you get?

09:32.909 --> 09:39.410
I got this,
and I got myself a Kraut bandage.

09:44.962 --> 09:51.380
–What? This is it?
–Yeah, that's it. That's all we got.

09:56.348 --> 09:59.931
1st Battalion's pulled out of Foy.
Heavy casualties.

10:00.185 --> 10:05.476
–Then why are we sitting here?
–We need morphine. This is all I got.

10:05.649 --> 10:09.148
–You got extra scissors?
–No. Just the one.

10:09.403 --> 10:12.238
–First Sergeant Lipton?
–Sir.

10:12.447 --> 10:16.860
–What's this? Two medics in one hole?
–Yes, sir.

10:17.118 --> 10:21.531
What's gonna happen to us
if you take a hit, huh?

10:21.873 --> 10:23.747
Sir?

10:24.000 --> 10:29.243
–First Sergeant, where's my foxhole?
–It's back here, sir.

10:29.422 --> 10:33.254
Maybe you missed it, huh?
I'll walk you back.

10:33.426 --> 10:38.301
–You're a bit close to the line here.
–Goddamn it.

10:44.436 --> 10:47.603
Sgt Guarnere,
did you keep any morphine?

10:47.773 --> 10:51.023
–No. Doc, I gotta talk to you.
–How's that leg?

10:51.193 --> 10:54.775
–Forget the leg, I'm pissing needles.
–Later.

11:01.703 --> 11:04.823
–You seen them?
–No.

11:05.040 --> 11:09.167
But they're out there.
Depend on it.

11:09.836 --> 11:13.785
–Cup of Joe, doc?
–Gordon, I need sharp scissors.

11:14.048 --> 11:19.090
Scissors? Well, let's see,
I'll have to check the sewing room.

11:19.262 --> 11:22.761
Might be upstairs in the study,
the desk drawer.

11:23.015 --> 11:26.847
All right. What about an extra Syrette
in your aid kit?

11:27.102 --> 11:29.391
Hide your morphine, guys—

11:30.731 --> 11:32.522
–Muck, you okay?
–I'm good.

11:32.941 --> 11:36.393
–Malarkey! Penkala!
–We're okay!

11:36.653 --> 11:40.865
Will you look at this shit?
They peppered my helmet.

11:41.074 --> 11:43.945
Hey, doc! Morphine!

11:44.661 --> 11:46.903
–Here, take it.
–Where's Penkala?

11:47.122 --> 11:48.995
Christ knows.

11:49.207 --> 11:51.663
Medic!

11:56.381 --> 11:58.788
Doc!

12:01.385 --> 12:04.221
–Medic!
–You guys hit?

12:04.430 --> 12:07.764
–Easy, doc. How you doing?
–Hey, are you crazy?

12:08.017 --> 12:10.508
Watch the goddamn line!

12:10.770 --> 12:13.225
–You got a Syrette?
–What?

12:13.606 --> 12:15.894
Medic!

12:16.066 --> 12:17.608
Go.

12:17.818 --> 12:19.229
Medic!

12:22.614 --> 12:25.900
–Doc!
–Penkala!

12:26.618 --> 12:29.239
–It's the artery.
–Penkala, let go.

12:29.454 --> 12:32.989
–It's a damn artery!
–Loosen your fingers, damn it!

12:33.291 --> 12:35.747
Relax your arm.
It's not the artery.

12:35.919 --> 12:39.703
I ain't going back.
I ain't going, not in this shit.

12:39.881 --> 12:43.636
–And you're yelling “medic”?
–I don't need no aid station.

12:43.676 --> 12:46.132
You're in luck, Penkala.

12:46.429 --> 12:49.264
We don't got no aid station.

12:57.690 --> 13:01.308
–You got scissors?
–What do I need scissors for?

13:01.527 --> 13:03.815
Got your aid kit?

13:07.491 --> 13:11.785
Right, well, you don't need this.
Not yet. I do.

13:14.956 --> 13:18.041
–Who got hit?
–Penkala.

13:19.919 --> 13:25.258
Here. I want you to take someone
and find the 3rd Battalion, okay?

13:25.508 --> 13:28.711
Bandages, plasma,
whatever you can beg, you beg.

13:28.970 --> 13:32.255
And get me some damn scissors.
I can't get any.

13:32.515 --> 13:37.426
You get yourself a hot meal too, huh?
Go.

13:57.748 --> 14:01.330
–He told me he's a goddamn virgin.
–Who?

14:01.501 --> 14:04.787
The replacement in my foxhole, Julian.

14:07.257 --> 14:10.293
Goddamn virgin. Just a kid.

14:10.552 --> 14:13.920
The only virgin I know
is the Virgin Mary.

14:16.307 --> 14:19.723
Hey, Babe. Where the hell are we?

14:19.894 --> 14:21.886
This way.

14:22.855 --> 14:27.481
–I don't like it.
–Where the hell is 3rd Battalion?

14:29.028 --> 14:32.693
–Shit.
–Come on.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.068
Give me a hand.

14:36.326 --> 14:38.319
Go. Go.

14:39.830 --> 14:43.662
–Come on, Spina. Move.
–I'm moving. I'm moving.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.869
We can spare a few bandages,
but that's it. No morphine.

14:49.047 --> 14:52.332
–Go back to Bastogne for plasma.
–Bastogne?

14:52.592 --> 14:57.088
–Doesn't your surgeon have plasma?
–We don't have one.

14:57.305 --> 15:00.803
–Just me and my buddy.
–Sorry, but we can't help you.

15:00.975 --> 15:03.051
Take cover!

15:05.688 --> 15:07.562
Get your butts out of here!

15:07.815 --> 15:11.398
–Let's go.
–Go! Move!

15:11.610 --> 15:16.071
–Should have shot Hinkle in the ass.
–Hinkle nearly shot him.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.738
God bless you.

15:23.664 --> 15:27.492
–These smell like my armpit.
–At least your armpit's warm.

15:27.626 --> 15:30.627
–You want syrup with that?
–What's in these?

15:30.837 --> 15:34.384
–Nothing you won't eat, Malarkey.
–I won't eat Malarkey.

15:34.424 --> 15:38.753
–Maybe Hinkle would like your share.
–I should have shot him.

15:39.012 --> 15:44.137
–Anybody seen Lieutenant Dike?
–Try Battalion CP, sir.

15:44.309 --> 15:46.978
–Try Paris.
–Try Hinkle.

15:47.228 --> 15:48.936
Hinkle, I'm home.

15:49.147 --> 15:51.851
Eugene, Lt Dike's got a full aid kit.

15:52.024 --> 15:55.559
–He's not using his.
–Maybe Hinkle's got a Syrette.

15:55.736 --> 15:59.300
–Eat your strudel.
–Hinkle Vinkle, eat ze armpit, huh?

16:08.165 --> 16:11.949
Lieutenant Dike. Lieutenant.

16:13.086 --> 16:16.171
Can you spare some Syrettes
from your aid kit?

16:16.423 --> 16:19.258
–What, morphine?
–Yes, sir.

16:23.430 --> 16:28.886
–What happens if I get hit?
–I'll be there, sir.

16:29.143 --> 16:31.255
–Syrette's in here, right?
–Yes.

16:31.437 --> 16:37.606
–Here. I don't plan on getting hit.
–Thank you, sir.

16:41.238 --> 16:44.987
Heffron, you okay?

16:45.201 --> 16:49.744
Gene, what's with the Heffron shit?
You know my name. Use it.

16:49.997 --> 16:51.574
It's Edward, right?

16:51.832 --> 16:56.245
Are you serious?
Only the goddamn nuns call me “Edward”.

16:56.461 --> 17:01.669
–You have any morphine from Holland?
–No. You asked already, remember?

17:01.842 --> 17:04.842
No. I don't recall.

17:21.277 --> 17:23.104
Gordon, you want me?

17:23.362 --> 17:28.701
Yeah, morphine. 3rd Platoon
ponied up the contraband.

17:29.326 --> 17:31.652
–Still looking for scissors?
–Yes.

17:31.912 --> 17:33.988
Perconte.

17:35.582 --> 17:39.794
–Doc.
–Thank you.

17:40.045 --> 17:46.000
You'd better check on Joe Toye out
on the OP. He's missing something.

17:47.260 --> 17:49.336
Thanks.

18:01.691 --> 18:05.107
–You guys okay?
–They got hot food. Smell it?

18:05.361 --> 18:07.341
–You missing something?
–Home.

18:07.363 --> 18:09.984
Ask him to dance, doc.

18:12.368 --> 18:17.706
–Toye, show me your feet.
–You watch the goddamn line, McClung.

18:18.791 --> 18:23.868
–Where are your boots?
–In Washington, up Gen. Taylor's ass.

18:24.046 --> 18:27.545
–I can move better in bare feet.
–What happened?

18:27.799 --> 18:31.879
Took them off to dry my socks
and they got blown to hell.

18:32.095 --> 18:37.516
–Well, what's your size?
–Nine, just like everybody else.

18:42.188 --> 18:46.020
You keep cleaning those teeth,
the Germans will see you.

18:46.234 --> 18:49.484
That's right, Pee Wee.
You keep laughing.

18:49.696 --> 18:51.487
Hey, doc.

18:51.697 --> 18:54.651
Doc, my stuff. Come on, doc.

18:54.909 --> 18:58.408
–You got a drug store in here?
–No, just my stuff.

18:58.663 --> 19:03.538
–What are you looking for?
–Scissors. Thank you, Perconte.

19:03.751 --> 19:06.502
My goddamn scissors.

19:08.172 --> 19:10.710
–Sgt Guarnere.
–Marlene, is that you?

19:10.966 --> 19:15.295
–Hey, doc, come here.
–USO, picking up Syrettes.

19:15.554 --> 19:18.009
–Alley, Liebgott, you got any?
–No.

19:18.265 --> 19:22.725
You ain't using this stuff are you?
I mean personal, like.

19:22.936 --> 19:26.720
Doc, I still got the itching.
When I pee, it's murder.

19:26.981 --> 19:30.101
I don't have any penicillin
for your biroute.

19:30.360 --> 19:34.025
–Lieutenant, move around a bit.
–I can't feel my feet.

19:34.238 --> 19:36.527
That's why you gotta move around.

19:36.741 --> 19:41.818
–Should I take my boots off?
–No, just loosen them up and move.

19:42.038 --> 19:47.376
Sergeant, I know it must be hell but
I can't help you. Drink lots of water.

19:47.626 --> 19:52.205
–Water? It's pissing that hurts.
–Shut it. Shut the hell up.

19:52.464 --> 19:56.544
–Who the hell's singing, Bill?
–I'll find out, lieutenant.

19:56.760 --> 19:59.844
–Stop them from singing.
–I'll shut them up.

20:17.363 --> 20:22.440
Lord, grant that I shall never seek
to be consoled as to console…

20:22.702 --> 20:26.830
to be understood as to understand,
or to be loved…

20:27.081 --> 20:31.375
as to love with all my heart.

20:33.045 --> 20:35.536
With all my heart.

20:38.634 --> 20:41.172
Medic!

20:43.347 --> 20:46.881
Medic! Medic!

20:49.603 --> 20:51.928
–Perconte, get a jeep.
–I'm on it.

20:52.147 --> 20:55.598
–Look at my leg.
–Easy CP, this is Perconte.

20:55.817 --> 21:01.156
–Bear with me. Bear with me.
–Sisk has been hit. I need a jeep.

21:01.906 --> 21:05.571
They're moving, goddamn it!
We need it now!

21:06.327 --> 21:08.569
You'll be all right, Sisk.

21:10.540 --> 21:15.166
–Okay, Sisk. It ain't that bad.
–It ain't that bad?

21:20.716 --> 21:22.874
Okay, one pull.

21:23.093 --> 21:26.462
No, save the morphine.
I can make it. Save it.

21:26.930 --> 21:29.848
All right, let's get him out of here.

21:35.564 --> 21:39.312
–Where's the jeep?
–I don't know, but I hear it.

21:40.235 --> 21:43.651
–Jesus Christ!
–You got blood on my trousers.

21:43.822 --> 21:47.440
–I'm real sorry, Frank.
–Get him up.

21:50.078 --> 21:52.485
Damn it, Skinny.

21:53.289 --> 21:56.041
Tell Spina I went in for plasma.

22:02.923 --> 22:06.091
All the tanks and artillery
pulled back to here.

22:06.343 --> 22:09.428
We got no backup beyond Bastogne.
This is it.

22:09.680 --> 22:12.930
The Krauts captured the 326th Medical.

22:13.142 --> 22:18.349
They took doctors, medics,
the whole shebang. We got nothing.

22:22.943 --> 22:25.055
The boys get Hooch for the pain.

22:26.363 --> 22:29.399
–He took a mortar hit. Watch the leg.
–Yeah.

22:29.616 --> 22:31.692
Get him in.

22:39.917 --> 22:43.203
–Move it.
–Coming through.

22:43.462 --> 22:45.835
Move it, fellas.

22:52.847 --> 22:57.971
–No, no. Here. Put him here.
–Yes, ma'am.

22:59.520 --> 23:03.600
–Is he bad?
–No, lower-leg wound. No morphine.

23:06.276 --> 23:11.234
–Nurse, have you got plasma I can—?
–Wait. Please.

23:42.436 --> 23:46.813
–Why ain't these men evacuated?
–We can't. We're cut off.

23:47.065 --> 23:49.900
This is as far as it goes.

24:15.343 --> 24:18.047
I'm in heaven, doc.

24:18.763 --> 24:22.178
–Nurse.
–This way.

24:23.350 --> 24:28.890
I need morphine. I need bandages.
Whatever you got. We got nothing.

24:29.940 --> 24:33.688
Okay, I can give you a little,
but not a lot.

24:35.696 --> 24:39.942
–You can have this today.
–You got plasma?

24:40.200 --> 24:44.150
–A little. Are you a surgeon?
–No. We have no surgeon.

24:44.412 --> 24:47.449
–What's this?
–From the bed.

24:47.707 --> 24:52.250
–What, sheets?
–Yes, for bandages.

25:02.054 --> 25:06.052
–My name is Renée.
–I'm Gene. Eugene Roe.

25:06.308 --> 25:10.472
–Where are you from?
–Louisiana. Half-Cajun.

25:10.646 --> 25:14.975
–Et toi, tu viens d'où?
–Bastogne.

25:20.906 --> 25:23.657
Can you get me back to the line?

25:23.909 --> 25:25.818
Sure.

25:30.498 --> 25:32.705
Eugene.

25:34.836 --> 25:36.745
Chocolat.

25:37.714 --> 25:38.994
Pour vous.

26:02.738 --> 26:04.861
–Amen.
–Amen.

26:05.115 --> 26:10.702
Fight well for God and your country.
God bless you all. Stay safe.

26:10.954 --> 26:13.410
That's it.
Nothing to worry about.

26:13.665 --> 26:19.003
We die now, we die in a state of grace.
Isn't that right, Babe?

26:19.254 --> 26:22.171
Battalion want
a reconnaissance patrol.

26:22.423 --> 26:28.675
I'll go. Take these. Give the boots
to Joe Toye. Tell him they're a nine.

26:34.894 --> 26:38.428
–We go until we make contact.
–Peacock's leading.

26:38.689 --> 26:42.390
That asshole couldn't find a snowball
in a blizzard.

26:42.651 --> 26:44.810
–That's the order.
–Sarge?

26:45.070 --> 26:47.822
–Julian.
–Let me be the lead scout.

26:48.073 --> 26:50.529
–Back in line, private.
–Move out.

26:50.784 --> 26:52.326
Tactical columns, men.

26:52.494 --> 26:57.701
Doc, it's a combat patrol. Why don't
you stay back and keep out of trouble?

26:57.874 --> 27:00.282
–Yes, sergeant.
–Yeah.

27:05.590 --> 27:08.626
Come on, Hoobler, pick it up.

27:29.113 --> 27:31.983
Right. Move out.

27:40.707 --> 27:42.367
Go.

27:43.543 --> 27:47.208
–Fire!
–Get down! Get down!

27:50.633 --> 27:52.460
Shit.

27:56.139 --> 28:02.011
Bull! Christenson! Up on line!

28:08.317 --> 28:13.062
–Johnny!
–We got a man down!

28:16.033 --> 28:18.156
–What have we got?
–Kid's down.

28:18.368 --> 28:21.868
–We gotta make a move.
–I can get him, sarge.

28:22.122 --> 28:24.874
–Suppressing fire!
–Suppressing fire.

28:25.125 --> 28:29.123
–One man down. Easy.
–Covering fire.

28:29.379 --> 28:32.250
Hold them down!

28:34.009 --> 28:37.259
Easy CP, I have one man down.

28:43.101 --> 28:48.095
Stay there. Don't move.
Stop moving or they'll keep shooting.

28:55.404 --> 28:59.651
–What's happening, sir?
–We're pulling back. We made contact.

28:59.867 --> 29:02.903
I gotta get to the CP.

29:07.541 --> 29:13.128
Don't move. Don't move
or they'll keep firing. Stop moving!

29:13.630 --> 29:16.501
Fuck. Sarge, what—?

29:16.758 --> 29:20.209
Pull back! We gotta pull back!

29:20.470 --> 29:23.340
–Let's get the hell out of here!
–Let's go!

29:23.598 --> 29:26.718
–Move!
–Go!

29:26.976 --> 29:29.728
Come on, stay with us.
Hold on!

29:29.979 --> 29:34.641
Stay with us! Look at me.
Stay with us! Hold on.

29:34.901 --> 29:38.020
–Heffron, move!
–Don't move, we're coming back.

29:38.237 --> 29:43.611
–We'll get you out of here. Hold on.
–Go. Let's go!

29:53.627 --> 29:56.996
–On me, move!
–Come on, let's go.

29:57.172 --> 30:01.549
–Where the hell are we?
–Straight ahead. Straight ahead.

30:03.178 --> 30:06.511
Doc! Doc!

30:07.223 --> 30:11.007
–Okay!
–Set it up on the rock.

30:11.227 --> 30:14.477
Easy CP. Easy CP. Lightning, over.

30:14.731 --> 30:17.981
–I need a jeep at the CP.
–Eyes sharp!

30:18.192 --> 30:20.268
Okay, I got your jeep, doc.

30:20.486 --> 30:23.024
–Martin? Martin!
–Sir?

30:23.281 --> 30:25.591
–What's going on?
–They got Julian.

30:25.700 --> 30:29.066
–He's alive. We gotta get him.
–We don't know that.

30:29.078 --> 30:31.957
–Did you hit an OP or their line?
–Their line.

30:31.997 --> 30:34.749
–We gotta get Julian!
–No, fall back.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.914
–Where's Peacock?
–At the CP.

30:37.044 --> 30:38.953
–Fall back!
–You okay, doc?

30:39.213 --> 30:41.750
–Get him out of here!
–We gotta go.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.883
Let's up and go!

30:45.177 --> 30:47.750
–We gotta move. Let's go!
–Get him up.

30:48.430 --> 30:51.347
Doc, now! Let's go!

30:53.476 --> 30:55.350
Move!

30:55.603 --> 30:59.471
–Let's go.
–Back, fall back!

31:13.329 --> 31:19.201
We couldn't get to him, captain.
Babe tried. We couldn't get to him.

31:30.429 --> 31:34.473
Hey, Bull.
Let me sit in here with you guys.

32:24.439 --> 32:26.764
Heffron.

32:27.525 --> 32:29.897
Toye.

32:30.695 --> 32:33.316
What you doing out here?

32:34.449 --> 32:37.615
Thanks for the boots, doc.
Doing fine.

32:37.869 --> 32:41.119
Are you still having trouble
with your feet?

32:41.956 --> 32:45.407
Show me. Let me see it.

32:59.222 --> 33:03.765
It's trench foot. If it turns
gangrene, you could lose it.

33:03.977 --> 33:07.097
I ain't coming off the line, doc.

33:10.942 --> 33:14.643
Well, you gotta stay dry.
Massage your feet.

33:14.904 --> 33:18.154
Change socks every day
and dry the wet ones.

33:18.366 --> 33:19.943
–Trying.
–Do it.

33:20.201 --> 33:22.407
I'm working on it.

33:28.876 --> 33:32.576
–You seen Heffron?
–No. Why?

33:32.838 --> 33:35.459
He ain't in his hole.

33:38.469 --> 33:40.046
Fuck.

33:51.773 --> 33:54.015
Got you.

34:01.324 --> 34:03.400
Heffron.

34:12.877 --> 34:15.083
Edward.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.081
Eat it.

34:24.554 --> 34:26.761
Good.

34:30.393 --> 34:32.801
All right.

34:38.735 --> 34:45.402
I promised him if he got hit, I'd get
his stuff and bring it to his mom.

34:49.203 --> 34:52.703
–Now the fucking Krauts'll strip him.
–It's okay.

34:52.956 --> 34:56.907
It's not. It's not okay.

34:57.753 --> 35:00.423
I should have got to him.

35:33.580 --> 35:37.791
What do you call those people again?
Those Cajun healers?

35:38.042 --> 35:41.209
Traiteurs.

35:41.462 --> 35:46.338
–You know, my grandma was a traiteuse.
–Your grandmother? No shit?

35:46.592 --> 35:52.547
She was. Laid her hands
on people and cured them.

35:53.182 --> 35:56.930
Took away sickness, cancer,
you name it.

35:57.144 --> 36:01.307
Your grandma did that?
You're shitting me.

36:01.565 --> 36:05.942
–I remember she used to pray a lot.
–Yeah, I guess she had to.

36:06.194 --> 36:10.108
Talked to God
about the pain she pulled out.

36:10.365 --> 36:15.359
Asked him to carry it away.

36:20.375 --> 36:23.079
That's what she did.

36:25.338 --> 36:31.292
I'm still trying to figure why they
picked me for a medic. God knows.

36:31.552 --> 36:36.546
Snap of a finger and just like that,
you're a medic.

36:37.600 --> 36:40.933
I've had enough playing doctor.

36:42.062 --> 36:45.929
Hey, how about you?

38:16.111 --> 38:18.519
Take cover!

38:23.827 --> 38:27.112
Cease fire! Cease fire, goddamn it!

38:27.372 --> 38:30.741
I don't understand.
It was our own planes.

38:32.585 --> 38:38.291
C-47s. They're bringing supplies.
It's a drop. It's a drop. Come on!

39:15.919 --> 39:20.212
All right, you help the doc.
The rest of you, come with me.

39:31.934 --> 39:34.472
–Medic!
–Someone give us a hand here.

39:34.729 --> 39:38.596
–Help!
–Coming through.

39:40.359 --> 39:44.226
This one through here.
Now!

39:58.084 --> 40:02.378
The artery, we gotta find the artery.

40:13.933 --> 40:16.139
Anna!

40:24.235 --> 40:26.560
Anna!

41:35.678 --> 41:38.513
Where does she come from?

41:40.266 --> 41:42.674
The black girl.

41:44.854 --> 41:47.060
The Congo.

41:48.733 --> 41:51.224
How'd she get here?

41:52.319 --> 41:57.277
Just like me. She came to help.

42:30.481 --> 42:32.521
What?

42:34.068 --> 42:36.689
Your hands.

42:38.823 --> 42:41.064
My hands?

42:44.703 --> 42:47.538
You're a good nurse.

42:53.670 --> 42:59.127
No. I never want to treat
another wounded man again.

42:59.301 --> 43:02.752
I'd rather work in a butcher's shop.

43:06.182 --> 43:11.936
But your touch calms people.

43:13.022 --> 43:18.182
–That's a gift from God.
–No, it's not a gift.

43:18.402 --> 43:21.522
God would never give
such a painful thing.

43:33.417 --> 43:37.366
Nurse! Nurse!

43:38.088 --> 43:41.124
We need some help over here.

43:41.633 --> 43:46.129
–Got shrapnel though the stomach.
–How bad is it?

43:46.846 --> 43:49.681
Okay, get this one in first.

44:20.337 --> 44:25.129
–Now we know how they felt.
–What? Who?

44:25.384 --> 44:32.097
The legionnaires. When they watched
the Huns. Goths, the Visigoths.

44:32.265 --> 44:35.800
Visigoths? Jesus Christ.

44:36.061 --> 44:40.806
Barbarians.
They came right through here.

44:40.982 --> 44:46.818
Right through these trees. Sweeping
down to burn the shit out of Rome.

44:46.988 --> 44:50.154
That's a hell of a long ride.

44:51.701 --> 44:54.156
So, what's college like, Buck?

44:54.412 --> 44:59.750
You can study with cheerleaders
running fingers through your hair?

45:00.042 --> 45:05.795
Hell, Babe, I can't even remember.

45:10.260 --> 45:14.424
–Hey, it's doc.
–Sergeant. Heffron. Lieutenant.

45:14.806 --> 45:17.262
Wrap up.

45:18.602 --> 45:21.555
Never calls anybody by their nickname.

45:21.730 --> 45:24.600
–He once called me Edward.
–Is that right?

45:24.858 --> 45:28.772
–Edward? That's your name?
–Yeah.

45:29.028 --> 45:34.864
Funny, you…
You don't look like an Edward.

46:16.324 --> 46:20.368
Hey, doc. It's gonna get busy, pal.

46:20.745 --> 46:23.781
Hold your fire.
Don't let them draw you out.

46:23.998 --> 46:27.995
–Stay ready, boys.
–What do we hit those things with?

46:28.252 --> 46:32.332
Hold your fire. Get ready, Walter.

46:33.173 --> 46:35.925
Stay in your holes, guys.

46:36.176 --> 46:40.044
All you 3rd Platoon, you stay ready!

46:41.598 --> 46:43.176
–Smokey's hit.
–Medic!

46:43.392 --> 46:47.389
Hey, Gene, let's go.
Come on, let's go!

46:47.646 --> 46:50.267
Okay, go!

46:54.277 --> 46:56.733
Medic!

46:58.990 --> 47:00.567
–Doc!
–Smokey?

47:00.783 --> 47:02.990
–Hi, Mo.
–I'm keeping it for you.

47:03.202 --> 47:05.527
–Smoke!
–I can't feel my legs.

47:05.788 --> 47:10.414
–My foxhole. Get the plasma, now!
–Here they come!

47:14.964 --> 47:20.088
–Yeah, I got it. Go!
–Machine guns, open fire!

47:53.334 --> 47:56.169
Sergeant Lipton!

48:00.007 --> 48:02.842
Doc, we gotta get the hell
out of here.

48:03.093 --> 48:07.636
Hey, come on. Stay with us, Smokey.
Stay with us!

48:07.890 --> 48:11.590
Doc, we gotta get the hell
out of here!

48:13.562 --> 48:17.429
You ready? All right, go!

48:26.199 --> 48:29.532
–Stop. We gotta stop.
–All right.

48:31.496 --> 48:34.117
–Take the plasma.
–All right.

48:36.584 --> 48:40.747
Come on, Walter.
Come on, buddy.

48:40.963 --> 48:45.459
–Hurry. I gotta get back to the line.
–Okay, okay.

48:45.676 --> 48:47.467
–Lip.
–Yeah, buddy?

48:47.720 --> 48:52.678
–You're standing on my hand.
–Sorry, pal.

48:53.517 --> 48:56.684
Look, I'll get you
another Purple Heart for it.

49:00.065 --> 49:05.901
Hey, give us a hand!
I got you a ride, doc.

49:18.833 --> 49:21.039
Jones.

49:23.421 --> 49:27.086
Give it here.
Okay, put him here.

49:28.175 --> 49:32.552
Where's his tag? Where's his tag?
What's wrong with him?

49:32.805 --> 49:36.470
–Paralyzed.
–What?

49:36.684 --> 49:40.515
He's paralyzed. Can't feel a thing.

49:47.819 --> 49:53.026
In the name of the Father, of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

50:03.001 --> 50:05.242
Eugene?

50:06.129 --> 50:09.747
–Eugene.
–Renée!

50:12.343 --> 50:15.878
–Are you—?
–Renée, I need some help here.

50:16.096 --> 50:18.385
Are you all right?

50:37.158 --> 50:39.151
Here you go, man.

50:39.327 --> 50:41.948
One for the doc.

51:07.062 --> 51:12.020
They're having a Christmas dinner
of turkey and Hooch at Division CP.

51:12.276 --> 51:16.653
Damned if I don't like Joe Domingus'
rancid-ass beans better.

51:16.863 --> 51:20.363
–Hello, Easy Company.
–Hello, sir.

51:20.700 --> 51:25.825
General McAuliffe sent a message.
Thought your people'd like to hear it.

51:25.997 --> 51:29.496
That's your prerogative, sir.

51:30.376 --> 51:32.286
Men…

51:33.504 --> 51:37.834
General McAuliffe wishes us all
a “Merry Christmas”.

51:38.050 --> 51:41.419
“What's merry about all this, you ask?
Just this:

51:41.596 --> 51:45.427
”We've stopped cold
everything that's been thrown at us…

51:45.599 --> 51:48.636
”from the North, East,
South and West.

51:48.811 --> 51:54.232
”Two days ago, the German commander
demanded our honorable surrender…

51:54.400 --> 51:59.108
”to save the U.S.A encircled troops
from total annihilation.

51:59.321 --> 52:02.654
”He received the following reply.

52:02.866 --> 52:07.658
”"To the German commander: Nuts!"

52:09.789 --> 52:14.535
”We're giving our country and loved
ones a worthy Christmas present…

52:14.794 --> 52:17.878
”and taking part in
this gallant feat of arms…

52:18.089 --> 52:22.383
we are truly making for ourselves
a Merry Christmas.”

52:22.593 --> 52:25.843
–Merry Christmas and God bless you.
–Nuts, sir!

52:26.097 --> 52:29.548
–Nuts!
–Nuts!

53:32.327 --> 53:34.201
Bill.

53:36.331 --> 53:39.036
Picture of my girl.

53:39.376 --> 53:42.293
Good-looking broad, Buck.

53:44.464 --> 53:46.706
She's…

53:48.635 --> 53:51.505
She's finished with me.

53:52.597 --> 53:56.048
–Yeah?
–Yeah.

53:58.060 --> 54:00.812
Yeah. She's…

54:06.735 --> 54:09.985
Just in time for Christmas, huh?

54:13.867 --> 54:16.951
Just in time for Christmas.

54:18.497 --> 54:22.577
Shit, I almost forgot.

54:24.336 --> 54:28.416
–“Lucky Strikes means fine tobacco.”
–Where'd you get those?

54:28.631 --> 54:34.171
Merry Christmas, fellas.
You gotta thank jolly old “Saint Luz”.

54:34.345 --> 54:36.753
–Beautiful.
–Here.

54:44.355 --> 54:46.976
Here you go, Penk.

54:47.191 --> 54:52.232
I am shaking so goddamn much,
I feel like I'm dancing.

54:52.488 --> 54:54.776
Here you go, buddy.
There you go.

54:55.199 --> 55:00.323
–Frank, what are you doing?
–It's Christmas, Pee Wee.

55:00.537 --> 55:02.446
–Yo, Frank.
–What is it?

55:02.706 --> 55:05.327
–Lemon powder snow cone.
–Pass.

55:05.542 --> 55:08.459
Merry fucking Christmas.

55:15.176 --> 55:17.216
Harry.

55:19.514 --> 55:23.891
–Fire's not a good idea.
–Just a couple of minutes.

55:24.769 --> 55:29.478
–We're in a dell.
–A dell?

55:31.233 --> 55:34.934
Like where fairies and gnomes live?

55:38.282 --> 55:41.817
I swear I thought
I could smell a fire.

55:42.077 --> 55:46.454
I did smell a fire.
Are you out of your mind?

55:46.707 --> 55:49.411
No, we're in a dell.

55:50.794 --> 55:53.249
–Down!
–Put out the fire.

55:59.135 --> 56:01.626
Medic!

56:03.306 --> 56:06.426
I need an A-jeep to 2nd Battalion CP.

56:06.684 --> 56:10.184
–Stay still, Harry.
–Peacock, put that out!

56:11.898 --> 56:15.183
Medic! Roe!

56:15.860 --> 56:17.899
Doc!

56:18.612 --> 56:20.320
Gene.

56:20.573 --> 56:22.355
–Come on, doc.
–Is he hurt?

56:22.491 --> 56:25.112
–I don't know.
–Move.

56:27.746 --> 56:29.406
We gotta go.

56:30.707 --> 56:33.542
–Get up. The captain's yelling.
–Okay.

56:33.752 --> 56:36.290
Okay, get up. Not okay, lie down.

56:36.546 --> 56:43.213
Come on, move. Jesus Christ.
My hand. My goddamn hand!

56:43.470 --> 56:45.628
Roe!

56:59.610 --> 57:01.402
Roe.

57:08.035 --> 57:10.870
Stay still, Harry.

57:11.372 --> 57:16.911
–It's just a scratch, Harry.
–Jeep's on its way. Hang tough.

57:21.965 --> 57:24.005
Towel.

57:32.017 --> 57:34.638
–Give him some morphine.
–Where?

57:34.853 --> 57:39.016
–Opposite thigh.
–Okay.

57:43.277 --> 57:45.566
Elevate his head.

57:48.282 --> 57:50.488
Get him up.

57:52.661 --> 57:55.781
There you go, soldier, take that.

58:00.377 --> 58:05.288
Eugene, get yourself into town.
Get a hot meal.

58:21.439 --> 58:24.060
Get out quick!

58:30.198 --> 58:33.234
Clear the road!

59:02.103 --> 59:04.725
Get out quick!

59:25.417 --> 59:29.000
–Stay out of there!
–Are you nuts?

01:00:04.413 --> 01:00:09.159
Medic! Get your ass out here!

01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:11.666
Come on!

01:01:14.231 --> 01:01:17.849
Report, every hour,
on the hour, on the radio…

01:01:18.026 --> 01:01:21.893
or I don't know
where the hell you are.

01:01:39.547 --> 01:01:42.168
Everything okay?

01:01:44.093 --> 01:01:46.132
Babe?

01:01:47.012 --> 01:01:52.682
–Yeah.
–Hey, how'd you do that?

01:01:53.518 --> 01:01:56.056
You did that.

01:01:58.106 --> 01:02:00.514
I'll fix it up.

01:02:28.552 --> 01:02:32.466
Hey, Gene, you called me “Babe”.

01:02:32.723 --> 01:02:35.759
I did? When?

01:02:36.894 --> 01:02:39.301
Just now.

01:02:42.274 --> 01:02:44.729
Babe.

01:02:46.903 --> 01:02:49.525
I guess I did.

01:02:53.993 --> 01:02:56.152
Babe.

01:02:56.329 --> 01:03:00.790
Heffron, watch the goddamn line.
