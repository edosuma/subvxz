Mom, I understand you're
upset, but this is--

02:18.439 --> 02:21.039
Calling off the wedding
would've been one thing...

02:21.976 --> 02:26.645
but kissing that warlock in
front of the entire Institute?

02:27.481 --> 02:28.847
You've embarrassed
all of us.

02:28.849 --> 02:31.350
Why? Because he's a guy?
No.

02:31.352 --> 02:35.521
The fact that he is a guy, as you
say, is the least of my worries.

02:37.625 --> 02:39.091
Then what's the problem?

02:39.093 --> 02:41.527
That you chose Magnus Bane.

02:41.529 --> 02:43.328
His reputation
precedes him.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.198
And even for a warlock,
he's a bit of a lothario.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.934
Alec, there's so much that
you don't know about him.

02:48.936 --> 02:50.769
Well, then I plan
to get to know him.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.337
And if you have
a problem with that,

02:52.339 --> 02:53.906
then I suggest
you deal with it.

What she did--

On a scale of one to ten...

03:19.466 --> 03:21.033
Off the charts.

Don't underestimate

happened so fast.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.089

to think.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.358
I just wanna make sure
Lydia's okay.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.227
Now I owe her so much.

03:48.229 --> 03:50.162
We owe her.

03:50.164 --> 03:52.064
What she did
was nothing short of heroic.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.500
Hey, look,

03:55.502 --> 03:57.202
maybe we can
slow things down?

03:57.204 --> 03:58.770
Why don't we start
with that date you owe me?

04:00.107 --> 04:02.107
Yeah, let's do that.

04:03.344 --> 04:05.911
I know this great
Ethiopian place on 44th--

04:05.913 --> 04:07.145

04:19.360 --> 04:20.659

Better.

04:39.113 --> 04:42.447
Magnus is doing what he can
to help her, but it's bad.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.449
And the Cup is
definitely missing.

04:45.286 --> 04:46.585
[inhales deeply]
So is Hodge.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.120
Maybe he was attacked, too.

04:49.957 --> 04:52.057
Maybe he's the one who attacked her.
[Isabelle] Hodge?

04:52.559 --> 04:54.826
No way. We've known
him our entire lives.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.828
He would never do
that to us.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.313
I led him right to the Cup.

05:14.315 --> 05:16.281
We treated him like family.

05:16.283 --> 05:17.416
How could he do this to us?

05:25.492 --> 05:27.893
That's how.
What is that ring?

05:28.329 --> 05:29.828
Looks like he's
talking to someone.

05:32.499 --> 05:33.832
And I can bet who it is.

05:33.834 --> 05:35.434
Valentine.

05:35.836 --> 05:38.470
Well, that explains how he
deactivated the Punishment rune,

05:38.472 --> 05:40.138
but it doesn't explain
where he got the ring.

05:40.140 --> 05:41.973
You think someone
smuggled it past the wards?

05:41.975 --> 05:43.475
Maybe.

05:43.477 --> 05:45.844
Hodge wasn't the only
ex-Circle member around here.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.780
Look, I know I don't always see
eye to eye with my parents,

05:48.782 --> 05:50.282
but I know
they're not traitors.

05:50.284 --> 05:53.452
Really? Isn't that what
you just said about Hodge?

05:54.488 --> 05:56.888
It'd have to be someone we trusted,
but if there was an intruder

05:56.890 --> 05:58.824
inside the Institute, we would
have found them by now.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.125
What about
the Forsaken attack?

06:00.127 --> 06:03.161
No. We killed that thing,
and I didn't see a ring.

06:03.163 --> 06:05.530
He didn't have one
during the autopsy, but...

06:05.532 --> 06:07.532
maybe there's
something in the footage.

[Jace] There.
[keyboard clacking]

06:20.748 --> 06:22.414
So, it wasn't
a random attack.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.015
He was just
the delivery boy.

06:24.017 --> 06:25.851
If he gives that
Cup to Valentine,

06:25.853 --> 06:27.719
he'll create
an army of Shadowhunters.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.555
With that kind of power behind
him, he'll kill thousands.

06:30.557 --> 06:32.891
He'll kill thousands
just creating the army.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.226
Most mundanes
won't survive that.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.560
We won't let that happen.

06:35.562 --> 06:36.828
I'm gonna make sure of it.

I believe you have something
that belongs to me.

shall survive.

He's a Shadowhunter.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.675
Jace, what are you doing?

09:03.677 --> 09:05.810
Every second we waste here,
Hodge gets closer to Valentine.

09:05.812 --> 09:08.046
[stammers] Hey,
we're a team, all right?

09:08.048 --> 09:09.848
I know you're mad right now,
but Hodge could be dangerous.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.350
Two of us, one of him.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.219
Check the math, but I'm
pretty sure he's outnumbered.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.888
What is with you? Would you
just talk to me for a second?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.357
Lydia, Hodge...

09:19.359 --> 09:21.560
All this is happening because
I didn't stop Valentine.

09:21.562 --> 09:24.162
Jace, you cannot let emotions
cloud your judgment.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.298
Your words, remember?

09:26.934 --> 09:28.199
When I first
wanted to find my mom,

09:28.201 --> 09:29.734
I didn't care
about anyone else.

09:29.736 --> 09:31.736
But you were the one
that taught me that

09:31.738 --> 09:33.371
it's about a world
that's bigger than us.

09:33.373 --> 09:35.373
That's why you need
to wake her up.

09:35.375 --> 09:37.042
She was his prisoner...

09:37.044 --> 09:38.910
and his wife.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.112
If anyone can stop him, she can.
Jace, listen to me--

09:41.114 --> 09:42.347
You can do this.

09:42.349 --> 09:43.915
Maybe I can.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.751
But it's not about me,
it's you I'm worried about.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.987
You cannot let Valentine's
evil poison you!

09:49.723 --> 09:50.822
He's my father.

09:51.925 --> 09:54.593
Actually...
he's our father.

09:55.929 --> 09:57.362
You don't get it.

[Alec] Jace...

10:05.739 --> 10:06.905
How are we
gonna find Hodge?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.607
He didn't leave
anything we can track.

10:08.609 --> 10:10.542
I might be able to
ask Magnus for help.

10:10.544 --> 10:12.944
You need to stop thinking
with your stele, Alec.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.713
There's more than
one way to track.

10:16.717 --> 10:18.750
This is my fault.

10:18.752 --> 10:20.118
He walked
right past me, Jace!

10:20.954 --> 10:22.487
Yeah, if I'd have known--

10:24.625 --> 10:25.857
Yeah, I'll be right there.

10:29.596 --> 10:30.829
Hodge Starkweather.

10:30.831 --> 10:31.930
Hunt him down.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.898
I want him found
and I want him alive.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.967
[low growling]

10:46.813 --> 10:49.481
Raziel's blood runs
through your veins.

10:50.817 --> 10:53.652
You're now the first in a
new order of Shadowhunters.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.490
[sighing] I have
given you great power...

11:00.427 --> 11:01.993
but I expect
something in return.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.162
Jonathan and Clarissa...

11:05.032 --> 11:06.164
find them.

11:10.103 --> 11:14.172
What do you need Jace and Clary for?
We already have the Cup.

11:15.809 --> 11:17.042
"We"?

11:18.812 --> 11:19.978
Yes.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.614
I promised you your freedom,
Starkweather.

11:22.616 --> 11:23.682
Nothing else.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.785
Have I not proven
my loyalty to you?

11:26.787 --> 11:29.888
You've only proven your
willingness to betray it.

11:29.890 --> 11:33.625
Do you really think that I would
allow a traitor into my ranks?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.395
I brought you the Cup.

11:37.397 --> 11:39.798
You've served your purpose.
Now you're free to go.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.032
Free?

11:42.069 --> 11:43.802
You promised me protection.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.671
The Clave will never stop
hunting me and you know that.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.039
Well, now that
I have the Cup,

are numbered.

The Clave will
no longer bother you.

11:53.513 --> 11:56.514
And you will
no longer bother me.

11:56.516 --> 12:00.585
Now, I suggest you enjoy your
freedom before I change my mind.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.929
For Shadowhunters, you don't seem
to do a lot of Shadowhunting.

12:10.931 --> 12:14.566
[scoffs] There is more to
the job than killing demons.

12:14.568 --> 12:16.367
We need to talk to Camille.

12:16.369 --> 12:18.369
We know you have her here. We
tracked her to the DuMort.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.940
It's true, but I'm afraid she's
a bit tied up at the moment.

12:21.942 --> 12:23.675
Is there something
I can help you with?

12:23.677 --> 12:24.809
Just a second.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.446
[sighs] Look,
I know this sounds crazy,

12:28.448 --> 12:30.381
but we have to let
them talk to Camille.

12:30.383 --> 12:33.518
She has a spell book that could
wake up Jocelyn Fairchild.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.853
Valentine might have
the Cup.

12:34.855 --> 12:36.121
The entire Downworld's
in danger.

12:36.123 --> 12:38.123
She's far too dangerous.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.859
Or did you already forget what
happened last time you "talked" to her?

12:40.861 --> 12:42.093
It's not like she can
kill me again.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.062
You said it yourself...

12:44.064 --> 12:46.364
if Valentine has the Cup, the
entire Downworld is at risk.

12:46.366 --> 12:47.766
Camille will only
make things worse.

12:47.768 --> 12:49.267
[sighs]

12:49.269 --> 12:50.702
I'll bring you what's left
of Camille's things,

12:50.704 --> 12:51.870
but speaking to her
is out of the question.

12:51.872 --> 12:53.938
[scoffing] Her things?

12:53.940 --> 12:56.441
This isn't the kind of book she
would've just left sitting around.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.876
[Raphael] I'm sorry...

12:57.878 --> 12:58.977
but that's the best
I can do.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.913
We're supposed to be allies.
And we are.

13:01.915 --> 13:03.281
But Shadowhunters
have no business

13:03.283 --> 13:05.734
interfering with
the Night Children's affairs.

13:05.735 --> 13:08.186
You may look to the Clave for
justice, but the vampires look to me.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.355
Camille stays where she is.

13:10.924 --> 13:13.024
You're making a huge mistake.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.631
[wolf growling]

13:25.438 --> 13:28.072
[distant wolf howling]

13:28.642 --> 13:30.008
[wolf howls]

13:30.977 --> 13:33.478
[wolves howling]

13:39.920 --> 13:42.053
[grunts]
Where is it?

13:42.923 --> 13:44.222
Jace...

13:45.292 --> 13:46.925
I'm afraid you're too late.

13:48.028 --> 13:49.828
Valentine already has
the Cup.

13:52.032 --> 13:53.364
[both grunting]

13:58.038 --> 13:59.137
How could you?

13:59.139 --> 14:00.572
[panting]

14:02.609 --> 14:04.442
It was the only way
to earn my freedom.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.711
I'd been caged long enough.

14:07.113 --> 14:08.479
Caged?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.181
You were our teacher.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.317
We treated you like family.
We loved you!

14:12.319 --> 14:13.685
Family?

14:14.020 --> 14:15.119
Family?

14:16.022 --> 14:17.989
The Lightwoods
cut a deal, Jace,

14:17.991 --> 14:21.693
to have me punished for crimes
that they themselves committed.

14:21.695 --> 14:23.027
Don't you see?

14:24.030 --> 14:25.363
I was their prisoner!

14:27.033 --> 14:29.000
And besides...

14:29.002 --> 14:29.868
let's be real for a moment.

14:29.870 --> 14:31.936
You can't win. [chuckles]

14:33.173 --> 14:34.939
I taught you
everything you know.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.776
Not everything, Hodge.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.946
[yells]

15:14.948 --> 15:16.247
[screaming]

15:18.385 --> 15:19.784
[groans]

15:23.056 --> 15:25.189
[shuddering]

15:26.760 --> 15:28.092
[grunts]

15:28.929 --> 15:30.561
[Jace straining]

15:30.563 --> 15:32.096
It's over!
It's not over.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.865
He's a traitor.
He deserves to pay.

15:33.867 --> 15:34.966
You nearly killed him!

15:34.968 --> 15:36.134
Maybe I should've
killed him!

15:36.136 --> 15:37.969
He sided
with Valentine, Alec.

15:37.971 --> 15:40.104
The Clave let him go once before
and look where that got us.

15:40.106 --> 15:41.773
What are you gonna do?

15:41.775 --> 15:44.108
You're gonna kill every ex-Circle
member, even our parents?

15:44.110 --> 15:46.044
Robert and Maryse
aren't my parents.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.779
You said it yourself.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.847
They raised you.
They are your parents!

15:50.383 --> 15:51.916
Just calm down.

15:51.918 --> 15:54.786
There's a dungeon in Idris with
your name written all over it.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.058
[yelling]

16:05.131 --> 16:06.197
[Hodge groans]

16:06.833 --> 16:08.066
[grunting]

16:23.116 --> 16:24.916
It's good to see you,
Jonathan.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.752
I've been expecting you.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.492
I figured you'd
find Starkweather.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.194
I've trained you well.

16:37.297 --> 16:38.429
You don't know me.

16:38.431 --> 16:40.164
I raised you.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.500
We're not so different,
you and I.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.771
Hodge had it coming.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.040
You kill innocent people.
I'd never do that.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.108
Not yet.

16:50.977 --> 16:52.310
But it's all
a matter of time.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.078
The Clave has failed us.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.148
They've failed
all of humanity,

16:57.150 --> 16:59.083
but you knew that
as well as I did.

17:00.020 --> 17:03.221
Every day, the demons
get stronger, and soon...

17:04.157 --> 17:07.125
there won't be enough
Shadowhunters to fight back.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.128
The Cup can change that.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.864
The Cup destroys
more than it creates.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.100
Our job is to protect the
mundanes, not to kill them.

17:17.037 --> 17:20.304
Well, losses are acceptable when
the alternative is extinction.

17:21.841 --> 17:23.107
But come with me.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.812
Together we can use the
Mortal Cup to save the world.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.080
Oh, I am coming for you.

17:29.082 --> 17:31.549
We have unfinished business.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.356
So these are all
of Camille's things?

17:38.358 --> 17:39.490
All I could find.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.260
But she has hideouts
all over the city.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.562
Interesting.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.130
I thought you were looking
for a spell book.

17:47.767 --> 17:48.900
We are.

17:48.902 --> 17:50.068
"We"?

17:52.272 --> 17:53.571
Where are your friends?

18:02.882 --> 18:04.115
[inaudible]

18:05.018 --> 18:07.185
Give me a second.
I gotta deal with this.

18:08.088 --> 18:10.254
No one told me anything
about a new prisoner.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.223
That's because
you're not advisor

18:12.225 --> 18:14.125
to the interim
chapter president.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.927
I mean, you can take it up
with Raphael if you want,

18:15.929 --> 18:17.628
but, uh, I wouldn't...

18:17.630 --> 18:18.963
wouldn't wanna
tell you what happened

18:18.965 --> 18:20.298
to the last guy
that challenged him.

18:23.236 --> 18:24.268
Don't go anywhere.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.242
[exhales]

18:31.244 --> 18:33.611
Did you really think this stall
tactic was going to work?

18:34.481 --> 18:35.613
No...

18:36.483 --> 18:38.116
but I thought this would.

18:39.886 --> 18:42.437
[Raphael chuckles]

18:42.438 --> 18:44.989
Typical Shadowhunter... always
underestimating a vampire.

19:01.841 --> 19:03.608
Sure this will work?
Izzy's a pro.

19:03.610 --> 19:06.677
By the time that vamp finds
Raphael, we'll be long gone.

19:08.348 --> 19:09.747
[grunts] Let's get this
over with.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.182
If anyone catches us,
we're dead.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.550
Some of us already are.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.353
[sighs]

19:15.355 --> 19:18.022
Alaric, we've got Hodge. Call
off the rest of the pack.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.391
We're gonna need a pickup.

19:22.095 --> 19:24.795
We're at the subway station
near Bergen.

19:24.797 --> 19:26.731
Yeah. I'll see you in five.

19:29.135 --> 19:31.202
How's Hodge doing?
He'll live.

19:31.204 --> 19:33.804
It's Jace I'm worried about. Valentine
really messed with his head.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.940
What, at Renwick's?
Yeah.

19:35.942 --> 19:37.675
He went through
a lot recently.

19:37.677 --> 19:39.510
I thought we had settled it, but
something's killing him inside.

19:39.512 --> 19:42.380
I don't know what it is.
This is all too familiar.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.815
I saw a similar thing
with Valentine 18 years ago.

19:44.817 --> 19:46.317
Jace isn't Valentine.

19:46.319 --> 19:48.553
Not yet.
We gotta keep an eye on him.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.354
All right.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.558
Where'd they go?

19:53.560 --> 19:54.792
What do you mean?

19:58.998 --> 20:01.365
Once we open this,
there's no going back.

20:02.302 --> 20:04.902
Everything we've done to unite the
Downworld goes out the window.

20:04.904 --> 20:08.639
I wish there was another way, but if
Valentine gets ahold of the Cup...

20:09.542 --> 20:11.409
there won't be
a Downworld left to unite.

20:17.150 --> 20:18.549
[sighs]

20:24.357 --> 20:26.157
She's dead.

20:26.159 --> 20:27.858
Well, yeah.
What'd you expect?

20:27.860 --> 20:29.227
She's a vampire.
[screeching]

20:31.898 --> 20:33.264
Not so fast.

20:35.368 --> 20:36.767
What took you so long?

20:38.004 --> 20:39.704
Excuse me?

20:39.706 --> 20:42.273
I knew you'd come back for your
sire, just like you did before.

20:43.176 --> 20:45.176
We're forever linked,
you and I.

20:45.178 --> 20:46.444
How do you know
I don't want to stake you?

20:47.113 --> 20:48.246
Do you?

20:49.215 --> 20:50.348
No.

20:50.717 --> 20:51.882
I do.

20:51.884 --> 20:53.584
But that's not why
we're here.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.620
Where's the
<i> Book of the White?</i>

20:55.622 --> 20:56.754
The book of the what?

20:56.756 --> 20:58.556
The <i> Book of the White.</i>
Big, white spell book.

20:58.558 --> 20:59.890
Kind of explains itself.

20:59.892 --> 21:02.059
Never heard of it. And
yet we tracked it to you.

21:02.061 --> 21:05.796
Darling... what would I
possibly want with a spell book?

21:05.798 --> 21:08.432
[scoffs] We don't have time for this.
Put her back in.

21:08.434 --> 21:10.534
Okay, okay, okay.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.370
You said it was
a warlock book?

21:12.372 --> 21:15.139
Yeah. I think my mom
gave it to you.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.374
She ran an antique store.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.975
Vampires sell that
sort of stuff, right?

21:17.977 --> 21:19.310
All the time.

21:19.312 --> 21:22.146
But if your mother was even
half as charming as you,

21:22.148 --> 21:23.481
I'm pretty sure
I'd remember her.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.349
What about Dorothea Rollins?

21:26.386 --> 21:27.485
She was my mom's assistant.

21:27.487 --> 21:28.719
Dot?

21:28.721 --> 21:31.389
Oh, but of course.

21:31.391 --> 21:32.990
She was our
favorite customer.

21:34.127 --> 21:37.495
So your entire life has been
paid for by my antiquities.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.997
I guess that means
you owe me.

21:39.999 --> 21:41.332
Do you know
where it is or not?

21:42.235 --> 21:44.602
It's in my apartment
on the Upper East Side.

21:44.604 --> 21:46.570
My own pied-a-terre.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.172
I can take you there...

21:48.174 --> 21:50.207
but you'll have
to get me out of here first.

21:50.643 --> 21:52.143
[exclaims softly]

21:53.413 --> 21:56.580
Or you can leave me in here, and
never get the book. [sighs]

21:57.183 --> 21:59.150
Totally up to you.

21:59.152 --> 22:00.551
[Clary sighs]

22:01.421 --> 22:02.887
[cell phone rings]

22:04.590 --> 22:07.825
[Alec] <i> Where the hell</i> <i> are you?
</i> I'm going after Valentine.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.360
Go help Clary.

22:09.362 --> 22:11.095
[Alec] <i> You're acting crazy.</i>
<i>All right?</i>

22:11.097 --> 22:13.030
<i>Whatever Valentine's</i>
<i>telling you, it's not true.</i>

22:13.032 --> 22:14.832
That's just it, Alec.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.500
It is true.

22:16.502 --> 22:17.668
He's my father.

22:17.670 --> 22:20.004
<i> He taught me how to fight.</i>
<i> Not to be weak.</i>

22:20.006 --> 22:22.440
You can't let him control you like this.
This isn't you!

22:22.442 --> 22:23.541
It is me.

22:24.444 --> 22:26.010
It's always been me.

22:26.946 --> 22:28.713
He raised me to be a killer.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.682
Now I'm gonna
make him regret it.

22:32.685 --> 22:33.884
Go help Clary.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.487
<i> She needs you.</i>
No. No. No, no.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.122
<i>You don't have to do this.</i>
<i>All right?</i>

22:38.124 --> 22:40.057
[stutters] You're not a--
Jace?

22:48.034 --> 22:49.934
Where's Valentine?
[trembling]

22:50.837 --> 22:53.337
Why don't you
ask him yourself?

22:53.339 --> 22:54.538
I saw you take the ring.

22:54.540 --> 22:55.940
And walk into a trap?

22:57.210 --> 22:58.476
I don't think so.

22:58.478 --> 22:59.477
[chuckles softly]

22:59.479 --> 23:01.779
[screaming]

23:02.515 --> 23:04.482
Tell me
what I need to know...

23:05.251 --> 23:07.685
or you're gonna
lose the other hand...

23:07.687 --> 23:09.053
one finger at a time.

23:09.055 --> 23:11.422
[panting] You're just
like your father.

23:12.358 --> 23:14.425
Then you know
how slow your death will be

23:14.427 --> 23:16.160
if you don't
answer my questions.

23:16.162 --> 23:18.329
[shuddering]

23:18.331 --> 23:19.997
[breathing heavily]

23:22.568 --> 23:24.068
Where's Valentine?

23:27.440 --> 23:28.606
[Simon] Okay.

23:31.744 --> 23:34.512
[sighs] Simon, it's 6:00 a.m.
The sun's almost up.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.046
No problem.
We'll go downstairs

23:36.048 --> 23:37.381
and take the tunnels out.
Come on.

23:37.383 --> 23:38.449
Going somewhere?

23:39.719 --> 23:40.851
Raphael.

23:40.853 --> 23:42.052
You should have stayed put.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.421
[hisses]

23:44.557 --> 23:46.541
I'm disappointed in you.

23:46.542 --> 23:48.526
I-- I guess it's too late
to put her back in the box?

23:48.528 --> 23:49.960
[Raphael] I'm afraid so.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.996
Our alliance is finished.

23:52.565 --> 23:54.865
The Accords may prohibit
killing mundanes,

23:54.867 --> 23:57.601
but they say nothing
about sunburned vampires.

23:57.970 --> 24:01.372
Simon's betrayed us...
just as Camille did.

24:01.741 --> 24:03.374
They deserve the same fate.

24:04.544 --> 24:05.643
Adios.

24:08.381 --> 24:10.047
Kill them.
[vampires hissing]

24:12.051 --> 24:13.117
[groans]

24:14.120 --> 24:15.519
[breathing heavily]

24:17.056 --> 24:18.522
[Isabelle]
Seriously, guys?

24:19.325 --> 24:20.624
[growls]

24:20.626 --> 24:22.226
[breathing heavily]

24:28.634 --> 24:30.601
[sighs] Typical vampire...

24:30.603 --> 24:32.570
always underestimating
a Shadowhunter.

24:32.572 --> 24:33.704
[hisses]

24:34.974 --> 24:36.173
Adios.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.875
[all hissing]

24:41.147 --> 24:44.248
[sighs] I think I'd have been better
off just staying in the coffin.

24:44.250 --> 24:46.116
But you didn't.
We got you out.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.751
Technically,
I got you out.

24:47.753 --> 24:50.521
Noted. Now, tell us
where the book is.

24:50.523 --> 24:51.689
Patience, my dear--

24:51.691 --> 24:53.591
Enough!
Just because we got you out

24:53.593 --> 24:55.192
doesn't mean I won't
kill you right here.

24:55.194 --> 24:58.095
There's still one more thing
I require of, um...

24:59.532 --> 25:00.698
Simon.

25:01.467 --> 25:03.000
A Writ of Transmutation.

25:03.002 --> 25:04.668
What the hell is that?

25:04.670 --> 25:07.671
A document stating you asked
her to turn you into a vampire.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.107
Signed and sealed
in your blood, of course.

25:10.109 --> 25:11.842
Haven't you had
enough of my blood?

25:11.844 --> 25:13.177
Never.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.778
And I definitely
don't want the Clave

25:14.780 --> 25:16.714
to falsely accuse me
of killing mundanes.

25:16.716 --> 25:18.649
You want Simon
to pardon you?

25:18.651 --> 25:19.850
No way.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.719
You killed Simon.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.854
The least we could do
is return the favor.

25:23.856 --> 25:27.291
And yet...
the second I go up in smoke,

25:27.293 --> 25:29.693
so does any hope of you
finding your precious book.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.028
[sighs]

25:31.864 --> 25:32.963
It's okay.

25:35.835 --> 25:38.369
So where do we get
this document, huh?

25:38.371 --> 25:40.671
I can't imagine
you have many friends left.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.439
I know a guy.

25:48.314 --> 25:51.515
So, Magnus,
how long has it been?

25:51.517 --> 25:54.318
One hundred?
One hundred fifty years?

25:54.320 --> 25:57.555
One hundred and thirty-eight.
Oddly, I haven't missed you.

25:58.824 --> 26:00.257
Of course you have, my love.

26:00.259 --> 26:02.526
All right,
you two can catch up later.

26:02.528 --> 26:03.827
Right now, we need to find
the <i> Book of the White.</i>

26:03.829 --> 26:06.564
And you will,
but not without payment.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.366
You of all people
should understand that.

26:09.368 --> 26:11.035
Of course.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.670
And what is it you require?

26:12.672 --> 26:13.771
A clean slate.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.573
She wants a Writ of
Turning-Me-Into-A-Vampire.

26:15.575 --> 26:16.907
And we need you
to draft it.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.443
Hmm. I thought
I was done with you.

26:19.445 --> 26:21.712
We'll never be
done with each other.

26:21.714 --> 26:22.813
[chuckles]

26:24.350 --> 26:25.849
I'm gonna call for backup.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.287
Simon, can I talk to you
for a minute?

26:32.224 --> 26:33.958
You don't have to
go through with this.

26:33.960 --> 26:36.126
If you want to go out there and
stake Camille through the heart,

26:36.128 --> 26:37.428
I will hold her down
while you do it.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.433
I don't even care
about that anymore.

26:43.235 --> 26:46.003
Nothing matters but Jocelyn.
We have to wake her up.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.173
She loves you so much.

26:49.976 --> 26:53.043
[chuckles] She was always kind
of like a second mom to me.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.447
Remember when she got me that
sealed copy of <i> Battletoads?</i>

26:56.449 --> 26:57.881
[chuckling] Yeah.

26:57.883 --> 26:59.950
I didn't even care that she opened it.
[chuckles]

26:59.952 --> 27:01.552
She just wanted
to watch us play.

27:04.657 --> 27:06.290
But Simon,
Camille's dangerous.

27:07.093 --> 27:10.060
If you sign this thing, we'll just
be setting her free to kill again.

27:10.062 --> 27:11.395
No.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.097
She's not half as
bad as Valentine.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.732
Your mom beat him once.

27:15.601 --> 27:17.601
If Valentine has a weakness,
she knows it.

27:17.603 --> 27:19.837
[sighs]
Or... maybe she is it.

27:19.839 --> 27:22.840
But... we have to
at least find out.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.708
I guess it's not just me
that needs my mom.

27:26.445 --> 27:27.745
It's all of us.

27:34.820 --> 27:38.255
You're still upset by my dalliance
with that short-lived Russian?

27:38.257 --> 27:40.658
Upset? No.

27:40.660 --> 27:43.961
I gave up feeling anything
for you over a century ago.

27:43.963 --> 27:45.229
Love is fleeting.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.798
Even more so when
you're immortal.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.833
And yet true love
cannot die.

27:49.835 --> 27:51.301
But people can.

27:51.303 --> 27:53.671
People are more than just
toys for your amusement.

27:53.673 --> 27:56.040
Hundreds of years old
and still so naive.

27:56.776 --> 27:59.710
You wouldn't know what to do
with love if you found it.

28:06.686 --> 28:08.752
Or do you think
you already have?

28:11.123 --> 28:13.123
[sniffing]

28:14.860 --> 28:15.726
Angel blood.

28:23.369 --> 28:25.235
Well, this is awkward.

28:25.805 --> 28:26.704
Where's the book?

28:27.707 --> 28:28.872
It's complicated.

28:28.874 --> 28:30.808
[Magnus chuckles nervously]
Clearly.

28:30.810 --> 28:31.742
I have it.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.345
And she's graciously offered
it in exchange for her freedom.

28:35.347 --> 28:37.781
And her freedom
requires a lip-lock?

28:39.051 --> 28:41.051
We don't negotiate
with prisoners.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.219
[Camille] Prisoner?

28:42.722 --> 28:44.088
I beg to disagree.

28:44.724 --> 28:47.224
You see, I'm your only
chance at saving the world.

28:47.226 --> 28:48.425
You need me.

28:50.096 --> 28:52.830
You certainly have a type,
don't you, Magnus?

28:52.832 --> 28:54.431
He's cute.

28:54.433 --> 28:55.766
Too bad it won't last.

28:55.768 --> 28:58.702
Say that again...
you won't last.

28:58.704 --> 29:01.505
I'd say he's about 20 years
from male pattern baldness.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.607
I don't have time for this.
Where's Clary?

29:08.848 --> 29:10.013
[sighs]

29:10.015 --> 29:12.082
Alec, did you find Hodge?

29:12.084 --> 29:14.718
Yeah, but Valentine
has the Cup.

29:14.720 --> 29:15.919
What?

29:16.922 --> 29:17.821
We're too late.

29:18.724 --> 29:19.857
Where's Jace? Is he okay?

29:19.859 --> 29:21.759
He went after
Valentine by himself.

29:21.761 --> 29:23.527
It's like he's
totally lost it.

29:23.529 --> 29:24.962
I tried to stop him,
but he wouldn't listen.

29:24.964 --> 29:26.864
We need to find Jace.

29:26.866 --> 29:28.899
He's in a dark place. We don't
know what he's gonna do.

29:28.901 --> 29:30.968
[gasps]
Luke is out looking for him.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.103
Jace wants us to
stay on mission.

29:33.105 --> 29:35.239
That means we have to find the book.
[Simon] He's right.

29:35.241 --> 29:36.874
We have to wake up
your mom.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.877
It's our only way
to stop Valentine.

29:41.747 --> 29:42.813
Ready to sign?

29:42.815 --> 29:45.415
Take us to the apartment,
give us the book,

29:45.417 --> 29:46.950
then you can have
your pardon.

29:54.794 --> 29:56.460
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.061
Good.

30:01.734 --> 30:03.200
[struggling]

30:05.905 --> 30:07.004
[groans]

30:07.006 --> 30:08.338
Where is he?
He was here.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.407
Where is he?
I don't know, he was here!

30:10.409 --> 30:11.875
[grunts]

30:20.820 --> 30:22.586
Ah, Jonathan.

30:23.589 --> 30:25.556
To what do I owe
this surprise?

30:26.125 --> 30:27.624
I've reconsidered
your offer.

30:27.626 --> 30:30.994
First you want to kill me,
then you want to join me.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.830
Seems a bit convenient,
don't you think?

30:33.833 --> 30:34.965
Do you want to
meet me or not?

30:34.967 --> 30:36.233
Yes.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.169
But on my terms,
not yours.

30:40.105 --> 30:41.805
'Cause I've taught you
better than this.

30:41.807 --> 30:45.075
Always strike where your
opponent is vulnerable.

30:45.945 --> 30:49.046
See, fighting you directly
could prove... difficult.

30:49.849 --> 30:51.014
But your friends...

30:51.483 --> 30:53.951
Well, your friends
are a different matter.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.027
[line ringing]
Pick up. Come on, pick up.

31:04.029 --> 31:06.196
<i>You've reached Clary's phone. I'm
not here, but you know the deal.</i>

31:06.198 --> 31:07.798
Damn it. Where are you?
<i>Leave one at the beep.</i>

31:07.800 --> 31:09.933
Clary, call me
as soon as you get this.

31:19.411 --> 31:20.711
[cell phone beeps]

31:31.156 --> 31:33.624
I thought the underground
parking was nice.

31:38.030 --> 31:39.496
Wow. You've got
a lot of books.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.031
I've got a lot of time
on my hands.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.000
Welcome home,
Madame Belcourt.

31:43.002 --> 31:45.435
[Isabelle] This place creeps me out.
[Alec] Yeah.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.571
Let's check the perimeter.
Good idea.

31:47.573 --> 31:51.041
If I know Camille, she'll have
a trick or three up her sleeve.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.943
[Clary]
I still don't get it.

31:52.944 --> 31:54.844
Why do you have this place
if you live at Hotel DuMort?

31:54.847 --> 31:56.680
The DuMort
has too many rules.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.415
Think of it like
Gracie Mansion.

31:58.417 --> 32:00.918
It's the official residence, but it
doesn't mean I have to live there.

32:02.054 --> 32:05.355
[sighing] This place gives me the
freedom to indulge in certain...

32:06.292 --> 32:07.524
proclivities.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.126
You know, the mayor
has the same problem.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.627
Ow!

32:10.629 --> 32:11.862
Hey.

32:11.864 --> 32:12.963
Come with me.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.636
On the dotted line.

32:23.976 --> 32:25.108
[sighs]

32:32.651 --> 32:33.817
Thank you.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.788
He did what you asked. Now
give us the <i> Book of the White.</i>

32:37.790 --> 32:39.056
I'd love to...

32:42.294 --> 32:44.161
[inhales sharply]
but I can't.

32:45.064 --> 32:46.263
I have no idea where it is.

32:46.265 --> 32:48.065
Dot gave it to you.

32:48.067 --> 32:49.433
I'm sure
it's here somewhere.

32:49.435 --> 32:50.901
But if the idea
was to hide it,

32:50.903 --> 32:52.836
telling me would
defeat the purpose.

32:52.838 --> 32:54.838
Dot must have put it somewhere
when I wasn't looking.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.140
So we have to search
the whole apartment?

32:57.142 --> 32:58.008
See?

32:58.010 --> 32:59.776
That's the spirit.

32:59.778 --> 33:02.980
Although I'd start now. I've got
four more rooms just like this one.

33:02.982 --> 33:04.081
[cell phone ringing]

33:09.121 --> 33:10.554
Good-bye, Simon.

33:10.555 --> 33:11.988
It's been a pleasure
doing business with you.

33:11.991 --> 33:15.125
Wait. I wish I could,
my little caramel.

33:15.127 --> 33:16.026
But don't worry...

33:16.628 --> 33:18.061
we'll see each other soon.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.931
[sighs] I hate
when she does that.

33:20.933 --> 33:22.132
Jace? Are you okay?

33:22.134 --> 33:25.335
Where are you? <i>At Camille's
apartment, Upper East Side.</i>

33:25.337 --> 33:26.837
Alucard building,
13th floor.

33:26.839 --> 33:28.772
You're in danger. Valentine's
probably already on the way.

33:28.774 --> 33:29.940
You need to leave, now.

33:29.942 --> 33:31.308
We are so close to finding
the <i> Book of the White.</i>

33:31.310 --> 33:32.509
I'm not leaving without it.

33:32.511 --> 33:33.844
Clary, you need to leave!

33:33.846 --> 33:35.312
<i>You said yourself,</i>
<i>we have to stay on mission.</i>

33:35.314 --> 33:37.147
You need to leave now.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.815
I can't.
[cell phone beeps]

33:38.817 --> 33:41.018
Clary. Clary!

33:41.887 --> 33:43.453
Damn it.

33:45.224 --> 33:48.392
I wish my mom had left us something.
Some sort of clue.

33:48.394 --> 33:50.994
Maybe she did. Did she ever
say anything about a book?

33:50.996 --> 33:52.396
[sighs] I don't think so.

33:52.398 --> 33:53.997
And if she did,
she erased my memory

33:53.999 --> 33:55.198
of anything to do
with the Shadow World.

33:55.200 --> 33:57.401
Well, there's got to
be something.

33:57.403 --> 34:00.003
Maybe the clue has something
to do with color, you know?

34:00.005 --> 34:03.707
White is the absence of color, so...
Or is that black?

34:03.709 --> 34:05.675
Simon, just let me
think for a second.

34:05.677 --> 34:06.843
Clary, that's a cookbook.

34:06.845 --> 34:08.211
I've seen this before.

34:08.213 --> 34:09.679
Chicken cacciatore,
remember?

34:09.681 --> 34:11.048
My mom used to make it
all the time.

34:11.050 --> 34:13.417
How could I forget?
Even better the next day.

34:13.419 --> 34:15.552
The gift that
keeps on giving. It's...

34:15.554 --> 34:17.687
[Clary] Maybe more than
we realized.

34:17.689 --> 34:19.823
Is that what I think it is?
[sighs]

34:38.844 --> 34:40.077
[Clary] This is it.

34:40.079 --> 34:41.845
You did it!
[laughs]

34:44.349 --> 34:46.450
We gotta go. He's here.

34:47.386 --> 34:49.019
[Clary] Let's go.
[Simon] Come on.

34:55.194 --> 34:57.127
Clarissa.

34:59.298 --> 35:01.131
So good to see you again.

35:05.604 --> 35:07.904
Where's your brother?
You think I'd tell you?

35:07.906 --> 35:09.272
You won't have to.

35:09.274 --> 35:10.474
Stay away from her!

35:10.476 --> 35:11.942
[Isabelle] Simon!

35:14.279 --> 35:15.779
[gasps]

35:16.381 --> 35:17.447
[Jace] Stop!

35:18.250 --> 35:19.516
This time
you're not getting away.

35:25.891 --> 35:27.224
Finally ready to kill
your own father?

35:27.226 --> 35:28.925
You abandoned me.

35:28.927 --> 35:30.127
I was protecting you.

35:30.129 --> 35:32.262
You weren't ready then,
but you've grown.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.631
You've become the warrior
I've trained you to be.

35:35.267 --> 35:36.133
You trained me well.

35:37.136 --> 35:40.203
And yet, I still have
so much to teach you.

35:41.106 --> 35:42.339
I brought you here
for a reason.

35:44.076 --> 35:47.144
Look, fight me,
and watch your friends die.

35:49.081 --> 35:50.347
[Alec grunts]

35:51.116 --> 35:54.384
See, you are strong,
but they make you weak.

35:55.254 --> 35:56.887
[Clary] Let us go.

35:57.856 --> 36:00.724
You can have the book. We won't
be able to stop you without it.

36:01.760 --> 36:05.428
Ah, Clarissa. [clicks tongue]
So like your mother.

36:05.430 --> 36:09.166
Willing to do anything
for those that you love.

36:09.168 --> 36:13.036
I'm touched, but... the book
was never part of my plan.

36:14.039 --> 36:16.339
I want you to
wake up your mother.

36:17.276 --> 36:19.376
I know that you'll both
join me eventually.

36:21.446 --> 36:23.180
It's fated.

36:25.951 --> 36:27.050
You ready?

36:42.401 --> 36:43.900
If I go with you...

36:44.736 --> 36:46.369
promise me
you won't hurt them.

36:47.039 --> 36:48.238
You have my word.

36:49.408 --> 36:50.407
This is insane.

36:51.210 --> 36:52.409
I'm sorry, Clary.

36:52.411 --> 36:53.476
Jace...

36:54.413 --> 36:56.079
what are you doing?

36:57.382 --> 36:58.315
You can't be serious!

36:59.518 --> 37:02.018
[voice breaking]
Valentine is wrong.

37:02.020 --> 37:04.254
[stutters] You're not like him.
I'm not. You're not!

37:04.256 --> 37:06.456
You don't know that, Clary.
You don't know that.

37:09.228 --> 37:10.260
Let them go.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.097
[breathing heavily]

37:14.099 --> 37:16.399
Simon...
Get back, get back.

37:16.401 --> 37:18.368
Alec, I mean it.

37:18.370 --> 37:19.669
Jace.

37:22.441 --> 37:23.340
Jace...

37:27.079 --> 37:28.912
[inaudible]

37:37.456 --> 37:38.888
What are you doing?

37:38.890 --> 37:40.457
Saving your life.

37:40.459 --> 37:42.859
If you enter a Portal not
knowing where you're going,

37:42.861 --> 37:44.661
you'll be stuck
in limbo forever.

37:49.268 --> 37:50.700
[sobbing]

38:15.927 --> 38:17.727
At least we got Hodge, right?

38:22.134 --> 38:23.233
Clary?

38:23.835 --> 38:25.402
We have to find Jace.

38:26.305 --> 38:27.904
He thinks Valentine
did something to him.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.840
Raised him to be evil,
but...

38:32.511 --> 38:34.944
But I know Jace.
He's good.

38:34.946 --> 38:38.114
He's tough.
He can handle himself.

38:38.116 --> 38:39.416
Besides...

38:40.285 --> 38:42.152
knowing Jace, I give it a
week before Valentine's

38:42.154 --> 38:43.420
[chuckling] begging us
to take him back.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.188
Simon, not now.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.124
We'll save him.

38:48.126 --> 38:50.327
What Valentine told
Jace about his friends

38:50.329 --> 38:52.362
making him weak,
that was wrong.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.031
Love makes us stronger.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.700
You saved me
from the vampires.

38:57.502 --> 38:59.769
Without you and Jace,
I wouldn't be here.

39:01.106 --> 39:02.205
We'll save him.

39:02.541 --> 39:03.707
I promise.

39:03.709 --> 39:04.908
Thank you.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.878
Whatever you do,
don't lose hope.

39:10.349 --> 39:12.515
I love you, Clary.

39:15.120 --> 39:16.786
I love you, too, Simon.

39:24.196 --> 39:27.230
I know you don't want to hear
it, so I'll just say it once.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.633
Whatever I felt for Camille,
it's ancient history.

39:31.536 --> 39:32.902
Almost literally.

39:34.573 --> 39:37.540
Yeah, but what she said about you
being immortal... she's right.

39:37.542 --> 39:40.410
You watch the people
you care about age and die.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.212
Alexander...

39:43.014 --> 39:45.215
I may be the High Warlock
of Brooklyn,

39:45.217 --> 39:47.384
but... even I can't see
the future.

39:49.388 --> 39:51.821
They're ready. [sighs] They
moved her to the Ops Center.

39:51.823 --> 39:54.090
Good. We need the space.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.992
Jocelyn's spell
is very powerful.

39:58.430 --> 40:03.433
<i> ♪ I hear it calling ♪</i>

40:03.435 --> 40:05.335
<i> ♪ Down in my soul ♪</i>

40:05.337 --> 40:07.170
Do you really think
this is gonna work?

40:08.006 --> 40:09.606
Let us hope.

40:10.342 --> 40:13.476
<i> ♪ It won't let go ♪</i>

40:14.713 --> 40:15.812
[fingers snapping]

40:17.282 --> 40:18.581
[Magnus] Jocelyn!

40:18.583 --> 40:20.283
[speaking Chthonian]

40:31.630 --> 40:34.731
<i> ♪ Wake me up ♪</i>

40:34.733 --> 40:39.602

40:41.206 --> 40:42.305

40:42.808 --> 40:44.040

40:54.986 --> 40:56.486
[chuckles] Mom.

40:56.488 --> 40:57.854
[voice breaking] Mom!

40:59.658 --> 41:01.724
I've missed you so much.

41:02.561 --> 41:03.860
Oh...

41:05.430 --> 41:08.164
I'm so sorry I didn't
tell you about your past.

41:08.166 --> 41:11.067
No, not now. I have had
enough for one day.

41:11.069 --> 41:12.702
We can talk about
all that later.

41:14.239 --> 41:15.472
Right now, I just...

41:16.508 --> 41:17.907
I just really need my mom.

41:19.511 --> 41:21.511
[sobbing]

41:21.513 --> 41:23.580
[Jocelyn] It's okay.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.316
[loudly] Join me...

41:27.586 --> 41:29.252
and my son!

41:30.689 --> 41:32.689
Pledge me your loyalty!

41:33.992 --> 41:35.258
Together...

41:35.827 --> 41:37.760
we can preserve our race

41:37.762 --> 41:41.698
and rid the world of the
demons who plague it.

41:42.467 --> 41:46.269
You are the chosen ones.

41:46.805 --> 41:50.640
The new breed
of Shadowhunters!

41:50.642 --> 41:53.076
[faint cheering]
