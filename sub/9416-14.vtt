WEBVTT

00:03.166 --> 00:05.083
Okay, who wants more pancakes?

00:05.166 --> 00:06.458
- Oh no!
- I'm not very hungry, baby.

00:06.542 --> 00:07.500
Well...

00:08.250 --> 00:09.125
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:09.208 --> 00:10.458
What's wrong with them this time?

00:11.000 --> 00:13.750
Well, it's not that they don't taste good,
although they don't...

00:16.083 --> 00:18.375
It's just pancakes
aren't supposed to be orange.

00:20.834 --> 00:24.667
Usually the food tastes bad,
but it looks the way it's supposed to.

00:26.625 --> 00:27.959
Now that's not even happening.

00:29.291 --> 00:30.959
Guys, quit picking on mom.

00:31.041 --> 00:33.375
She's just getting
in the spirit of Halloween. See?

00:33.875 --> 00:36.625
Orange on one side, black on the other.

00:38.417 --> 00:39.667
Actually, I burnt that side.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.417
The black was a happy accident.

00:42.291 --> 00:44.041
Okay, speaking of Halloween,

00:44.166 --> 00:46.917
I am shooting a segment
for Good Morning Denver ,

00:47.000 --> 00:48.208
called "Duncan's Punkins,"

00:48.250 --> 00:50.917
which will highlight
my pumpkin-carving prowess.

00:52.709 --> 00:56.667
I don't believe I'm familiar
with your pumpkin-carving prowess.

00:56.750 --> 00:58.709
I came up with the title
and worked backwards.

00:59.750 --> 01:02.875
Oh. I think those pancakes
are working their way backwards.

01:05.041 --> 01:08.125
So since we're filming it at the house,
everyone needs to be camera-ready,

01:08.208 --> 01:09.875
although not everyone will appear.

01:09.959 --> 01:12.375
- What's "camera ready" mean?
- Oh, you don't have to worry about it.

01:14.333 --> 01:15.583
Oh, mom, by the way,

01:15.667 --> 01:18.917
I got Charlie and Toby
the most adorable costumes.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.208
They're going to be lions.

01:20.291 --> 01:23.542
No. I don't wanna be
the same animal as Toby.

01:24.625 --> 01:27.166
Charlie, I already got the costumes.

01:27.250 --> 01:28.417
I don't care!

01:30.041 --> 01:35.250
Okay, so Toby is going to be a lion
and Charlie is TBD.

01:35.458 --> 01:37.375
That better not spell "lion".

01:38.834 --> 01:39.917

Okay, fund-raiser for the Drama Club.

02:40.834 --> 02:42.500
So we need to raise money

02:42.583 --> 02:44.834
so The Sound of Music can have music.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.041
And sound.

02:50.041 --> 02:51.083
How about a car wash?

02:51.291 --> 02:52.875
No, been there, done that.

02:53.542 --> 02:55.333
Just 'cause you don't like it,
we can't do it?

02:56.583 --> 02:58.709
Who made you President
of the Drama Club?

02:59.875 --> 03:01.792
You did. You all voted for me.

03:04.625 --> 03:07.500
- We could have a bake sale!
- Ah. That's boring.

03:08.208 --> 03:09.458
How about a chess tournament?

03:12.417 --> 03:13.458
Maybe nobody heard me.

03:14.208 --> 03:15.333
How about a chess tournament?

03:17.625 --> 03:18.625
Okay, you did hear me.

03:20.333 --> 03:22.917
You know, it's too bad
it's not closer to Christmas.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.583
We're all good singers,
we could go caroling to raise money.

03:26.000 --> 03:27.333
Wait a minute, that's it!

03:28.000 --> 03:30.542
Guys, we could do Halloween Caroling!

03:32.166 --> 03:35.959
Okay, so we'll take Christmas songs
and change the lyrics for Halloween.

03:36.333 --> 03:37.583
I like it!

03:37.667 --> 03:38.917
I don't get it...

03:39.667 --> 03:41.500
but I like it!

03:42.959 --> 03:45.625
When we go caroling,
I'm gonna go as a chess piece.

03:45.750 --> 03:49.250
The Knight. I'd go as a Rook,
but then I could only move...

03:49.542 --> 03:50.709
This way...

03:51.291 --> 03:54.542
And this way.

03:59.792 --> 04:01.041
That would've killed at Chess Club.

04:07.583 --> 04:09.041
Hey, I'm not doing anything
for Halloween.

04:09.125 --> 04:10.083
What are you doing?

04:10.166 --> 04:11.875
- Aren't you going trick or treating?
- Dude...

04:11.959 --> 04:14.291
I'm 14. I stopped doing that
like two years ago.

04:14.375 --> 04:16.417
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

04:17.083 --> 04:19.417
- When did you stop?
- Uh, same as you.

04:20.375 --> 04:21.250
Two years ago.

04:23.583 --> 04:26.417
Anyway, I was wondering
if I could hang out at your place.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.250
You know, maybe avoid all the excitement
of "Duncan's Punkins".

04:29.375 --> 04:30.792
Oh sure, come on over.

04:30.875 --> 04:32.208
We can rent scary movies,

04:32.291 --> 04:34.417
turn out the lights
and really freak ourselves out.

04:34.792 --> 04:36.208
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

04:36.625 --> 04:39.208
- Nothing really scares me anymore.
- Nothing?

04:39.291 --> 04:40.625
Well, except for when mom says,

04:40.709 --> 04:43.667
"I know we said
we'd never have another baby, but..."

04:49.375 --> 04:51.500
- Hey, Teddy.
- Hey, Victor, what's up?

04:52.458 --> 04:54.917
There's something I have to tell you.
It's about Halloween.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.500
I can't participate in the caroling.

04:56.709 --> 04:57.667
Why not?

04:58.208 --> 05:01.375
Because every Halloween night,
something terrible happens to me.

05:01.458 --> 05:04.709
I always end up getting egged
or TP'd or worse.

05:06.250 --> 05:07.500
A lot worse.

05:09.667 --> 05:12.000
Well, why didn't you say
something at the meeting?

05:12.333 --> 05:14.625
You seemed fine
with the whole Halloween idea then.

05:15.125 --> 05:18.959
When I mentioned my chess piece costumes,
that was just to be macho.

05:19.500 --> 05:21.041
In front of the ladies.

05:22.291 --> 05:25.291
We kinda need your male voice
on our big showstopper,

05:25.375 --> 05:27.625
"God Rest ye Merry Frankenstein".

05:29.041 --> 05:30.208
Let me give it a shot.

05:30.959 --> 05:34.166
♪ God rest ye merry Frankenstein... ♪

05:34.291 --> 05:35.333
Uh... uh...

05:35.458 --> 05:36.333
What's the next lyric?

05:36.375 --> 05:38.875
♪ I'll reanimate your corpse ♪

05:41.333 --> 05:43.834
You know, I had my doubts
about this idea, but now...

05:43.917 --> 05:46.083
- Yes?
- They're confirmed.

05:53.959 --> 05:56.250
So what do you think?

05:56.875 --> 05:58.667
- These pumpkins are amazing.
- Amy: Uh huh.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.667
Honey!

06:01.166 --> 06:03.458
I had no idea you were so talented.

06:03.875 --> 06:05.083
How could you have no idea?

06:05.166 --> 06:06.667
I tell you every day.

06:17.375 --> 06:19.834
Honey, could you come in here a sec?

06:22.333 --> 06:24.166
- Yes, Bob?
- Who's this?

06:24.792 --> 06:25.709
That's Marvin.

06:27.625 --> 06:30.250
From the Halloween store.
He's my assistant.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.083
- I do the hard work...
- Mm hmm.

06:34.166 --> 06:37.333
by coming up with the design
of what the pumpkin will look like,

06:37.417 --> 06:40.458
and Marvin here carries out my vision.

06:40.542 --> 06:42.333
- It's called delegation.
- Bob: Mmm.

06:44.834 --> 06:46.041
I have to ask,

06:46.125 --> 06:49.792
when you say things like that,
do they make sense to you?

06:49.875 --> 06:51.166
I don't really listen.

06:56.875 --> 06:58.834
Okay, guys, this is our first house.

06:58.917 --> 07:01.500
So let's start off
with our strongest song.

07:01.583 --> 07:03.125
"I'm Dreaming of a White Werewolf"?

07:04.834 --> 07:07.542
You think that's better
than "O Come All Ye Goblins"?

07:08.208 --> 07:10.333
It's hard to choose. They're all so good.

07:10.417 --> 07:13.041
Okay, guys, I'm gonna make
an executive decision.

07:13.125 --> 07:15.583
We're gonna start with
"Away In The Graveyard". Are we ready?

07:20.917 --> 07:22.375
All: ♪ Mmm... ♪

07:24.792 --> 07:27.709
♪ Away in a graveyard ♪

07:27.792 --> 07:30.917
♪ The zombie did lay ♪

07:31.208 --> 07:33.792
♪ Looking to eat brains ♪

07:33.875 --> 07:36.750
♪ All night and all day ♪

07:36.834 --> 07:38.583
Wait, wait, what are you doing?

07:38.709 --> 07:41.709
- We're Halloween Caroling.
- I don't get it.

07:41.792 --> 07:42.917
Me neither!

07:43.417 --> 07:47.125
So we're raising funds
for the South High Drama Club

07:47.208 --> 07:51.333
by taking Christmas Carols
and turning them into Halloween Carols.

07:51.417 --> 07:53.667
Uh, would you like to donate?

07:53.959 --> 07:55.000
Sure.

07:57.250 --> 07:58.458
Have a lolly.

08:04.625 --> 08:06.166
I've discovered a flaw in the plan.

08:11.917 --> 08:14.959
I said I did not want to be a lion!

08:16.375 --> 08:18.542
Honey, you're not a lion anymore.

08:18.959 --> 08:21.583
Look, you have spots! You're a leopard.

08:23.709 --> 08:25.875
- Really?
- Yes.

08:26.208 --> 08:29.250
And you know what?
Leopards are faster than lions.

08:29.375 --> 08:31.125
And stronger?

08:31.208 --> 08:33.959
- Sure!
- In your face!

08:37.458 --> 08:38.458
Okay, Kenny,

08:38.542 --> 08:40.667
let's see how these pumpkins
look on camera.

08:42.166 --> 08:43.333
Ba-bam!

08:44.333 --> 08:45.333
Oh no!

08:47.875 --> 08:49.458
Wha... what happened?!

08:49.542 --> 08:51.208
Pumpkins go bad fast.

08:51.291 --> 08:53.000
I think Marvin carved them too early.

08:53.417 --> 08:55.834
You want something done right,
you gotta do it yourself.

08:57.625 --> 09:00.333
- But you couldn't do it yourself.
- It's a saying, Bob!

09:03.333 --> 09:05.917
Okay, now that we can't
shoot the pumpkins, let's...

09:06.250 --> 09:08.208
Let's get a shot of the two lions.

09:08.333 --> 09:10.250
What? I knew it!

09:17.750 --> 09:18.709
Don't open that door...

09:19.583 --> 09:20.875
Don't open that door!

09:23.250 --> 09:24.792
- It's okay, you can look now.
- Oh.

09:27.625 --> 09:29.625
Oh, stop doing that!

09:29.709 --> 09:31.417
Why? It's always funny.

09:39.542 --> 09:40.458
Trick or treat.

09:40.542 --> 09:42.834
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:42.917 --> 09:45.041
I was not expecting trick-or-treaters.

09:45.375 --> 09:48.166
- This is an apartment building.
- But it's Halloween.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.583
- Sorry.
- Yeah, me too.

09:55.166 --> 09:57.417
- Trick-or-treater.
- I heard.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.250
You're aware of the size
of the apartment, right?

10:06.458 --> 10:08.917
- What was that?
- What was what?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.667
Are you cheap or do you just hate kids?

10:12.125 --> 10:13.375
Look, it's an apartment building...

10:13.458 --> 10:15.834
I know where we are!

10:15.917 --> 10:18.834
And since my kid didn't get a treat...

10:19.875 --> 10:21.125
You're gonna get tricked!

10:22.000 --> 10:22.959
What does that mean?

10:24.375 --> 10:25.875
Oh, you'll find out.

10:31.250 --> 10:33.000
Well, she seems nice.

10:35.083 --> 10:37.208
That's Lorna from 402.

10:37.750 --> 10:39.625
Everyone in the building
knows she's a little...

10:40.083 --> 10:41.792
- Off.
- Off?

10:42.041 --> 10:42.959
She's trouble, Gabe.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.875
If she's in the elevator,
you take the stairs.

10:45.959 --> 10:48.041
If she's in the lobby, you wait outside.

10:48.125 --> 10:51.875
And you never ever go in the laundry room
when she's in there.

10:51.959 --> 10:54.750
You never go in there at all,
you do all your laundry at our house.

10:54.834 --> 10:57.250
Well, if I did go in there,
I would not go in there.

11:02.834 --> 11:05.792

with Halloween lyrics.

11:24.625 --> 11:26.917
Finally! Someone gets it!

11:27.000 --> 11:29.709
Oh, I get it. I just think it's lame.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.875
Well, it's official.

11:33.959 --> 11:36.125
Nobody gets Halloween Caroling.

11:36.667 --> 11:38.917
He got it, he just said it was lame.

11:42.166 --> 11:46.250
Guys, can I help it if I'm too clever
for this neighborhood?

11:47.375 --> 11:50.208
Teddy, let's face it,
this night's a complete disaster.

11:50.291 --> 11:51.834
Not complete.

11:51.917 --> 11:53.667
At least nothing bad has happened to you.

11:53.750 --> 11:54.709
Yet.

11:55.875 --> 11:58.458
Guys, who cares what this guy thinks?

11:58.959 --> 12:01.250
- We should have done a car wash.
- Or a bake sale.

12:01.667 --> 12:02.959
Whoa!

12:10.083 --> 12:12.125
Victor, are you okay?

12:12.333 --> 12:13.875
Victor: I'm in a hole.

12:15.542 --> 12:19.500
Okay, just remain calm
and whatever you do,

12:19.583 --> 12:22.875
do not think about
the walls closing in on you.

12:23.083 --> 12:24.750
Or your fear of worms.

12:24.917 --> 12:26.208
Victor: Get me out of here!

12:27.750 --> 12:29.500
I rang the bell a bunch of times,

12:29.583 --> 12:31.166
but the guy wouldn't answer.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.375
He probably thinks
we're gonna sing some more.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.250
Victor: How's it going up there?

12:36.375 --> 12:37.625
Aw.

12:37.959 --> 12:39.250
Isn't that sweet?

12:39.417 --> 12:42.375
He's in a hole,
but he's worried about how we're doing.

12:42.792 --> 12:45.250
It's a little chilly, but we're okay!

12:53.959 --> 12:55.375
Can I do it, daddy?

12:55.458 --> 12:56.875
Well, sure, honey. It's all yours.

13:02.166 --> 13:03.417
Trick or treat!

13:10.542 --> 13:11.875
Thanks!

13:17.500 --> 13:18.625
I did it!

13:21.083 --> 13:23.750
Halloween is always focused on pumpkins.

13:23.834 --> 13:25.959
But what about other
fruits and vegetables?

13:26.041 --> 13:28.125
They deserve to be scary too.

13:29.166 --> 13:31.250
What about this evil eggplant?

13:34.250 --> 13:35.667
And who's this?

13:35.875 --> 13:36.959
Jack o'pepper?

13:40.333 --> 13:43.458
And what about the apple
that couldn't keep the doctor away...

13:43.542 --> 13:46.542
Because he has a knife in his head?

13:46.625 --> 13:49.417
Ooh, scary!

13:49.500 --> 13:50.959
Ooh!

13:52.417 --> 13:54.125
Kenny, is this as lame as I think it is?

13:54.250 --> 13:55.166
Amy: Yes.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.083
I've gotta come up with something else.

14:01.333 --> 14:02.166
Hey, Teddy.

14:03.125 --> 14:05.875
What? Victor's in a hole?

14:07.208 --> 14:08.333
Is he camera-ready?

14:09.583 --> 14:11.333
Oh uh, never mind, we'll be right there.

14:11.417 --> 14:12.250
Okay.

14:12.667 --> 14:13.500
Let's go, Kenny.

14:13.583 --> 14:15.875
Bob! We're leaving! You're in charge!

14:16.792 --> 14:18.166
Sure, no problem!

14:18.250 --> 14:20.041
Charlie and I
have got it all under control!

14:20.125 --> 14:23.125
Daddy, we runned out of candy.

14:25.166 --> 14:26.542
And our first bump.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.583
Hello?

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
Hello?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.250
Nobody there. Again.

14:41.375 --> 14:43.250
That's like the third time.
Who keeps calling us?

14:43.583 --> 14:46.542
Oh, I don't know,
maybe the woman who threatened you?

14:47.917 --> 14:50.458
Well, if she's trying to scare us,
it's not gonna work.

14:51.458 --> 14:52.458
Uh, you get it.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.458
Nobody there.

15:02.834 --> 15:05.208
Oh, ding-dong-ditch, real mature!

15:06.000 --> 15:07.709
Oh, come on, Lorna!

15:08.875 --> 15:10.834
That's it, I've had enough.

15:10.917 --> 15:12.667
I'm gonna go upstairs
and tell her to knock it off.

15:12.750 --> 15:13.834
Whoa, sure that's a good idea?

15:13.917 --> 15:15.291
I thought you said
she was a little off.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.542
Oh, what am I supposed to do?
Let her torture us all night?

15:18.625 --> 15:19.542
Hey.

15:20.500 --> 15:21.667
Does this make me look tougher?

15:24.333 --> 15:25.959
PJ, that's a Gurgles beanie.

15:26.667 --> 15:28.000
Well, it's all I got.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.542
- Victor: What's going on up there?
- Hang in there, Victor.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.083
Help is on the way!

15:38.375 --> 15:39.750
Hey, hey, back it up, people.

15:39.834 --> 15:43.041
Our friend fell in a hole.
It's a dangerous situation.

15:43.125 --> 15:45.792
Yeah, guys, this isn't a freak show, okay?

15:46.375 --> 15:47.291
Although...

15:47.834 --> 15:51.875
Step right up,
see the boy in the hole, only $5!

15:51.959 --> 15:53.959
All right, all right, make a line, people.

15:55.875 --> 15:57.500
- Is he out of the hole yet?
- No.

15:57.583 --> 15:59.583
Great. Kenny, we caught a break.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.834
Victor, it's Amy Duncan.

16:03.291 --> 16:04.959
Victor: Finally a responsible adult.

16:05.083 --> 16:06.583
Did you bring a rope or a ladder?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.500
No, I brought a microphone and a blazer.

16:10.166 --> 16:11.542
Three, two...

16:11.625 --> 16:15.583
This is Amy Duncan, reporting live
on Halloween night, with breaking news.

16:15.750 --> 16:18.709
Little Victor Deleseur
has fallen into a hole

16:18.834 --> 16:21.333
and may have only have
a short time to live.

16:21.417 --> 16:22.333
Victor: What?

16:24.041 --> 16:26.792
I'll be with you until the story ends...

16:27.000 --> 16:28.792
One way or another.

16:28.875 --> 16:29.792
Victor: Stop that!

16:37.083 --> 16:38.458
Trick or treat!

16:38.542 --> 16:41.083
Well, hey, look at you!

16:41.208 --> 16:43.375
That is one heck
of a costume you got there.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.542
And you know what? Because of that,

16:45.625 --> 16:50.750
you get a special treat
from the super fun mystery bag!

16:51.125 --> 16:53.041
Did you run out of candy?

16:54.208 --> 16:56.250
Maybe. Come on, just reach in.

16:58.542 --> 17:00.959
Hey, you got the coaster!

17:01.041 --> 17:03.875
Charlie, she got the coaster!
Ring the bell!

17:06.208 --> 17:07.458
Can I try again?

17:07.959 --> 17:11.959
Well, if you think you can beat
the coaster, be my guest.

17:15.125 --> 17:16.166
What is this?

17:17.875 --> 17:19.750
You got the Jack o'pepper!

17:20.208 --> 17:22.041
I'll take the coaster.

17:23.500 --> 17:24.959
Happy Halloween!

17:25.667 --> 17:27.250
Charlie, we're gonna need more coasters.

17:27.375 --> 17:28.417
I'm on it.

17:34.667 --> 17:37.667
PJ, it's been an hour. Where are you?

17:38.125 --> 17:40.250
Call me back, send me a text, something.

18:14.959 --> 18:15.875
PJ?

18:18.542 --> 18:19.709
PJ, where are you?

18:22.000 --> 18:24.125
I've been waiting for you.

18:27.375 --> 18:28.709
What have you done with my brother?

18:28.792 --> 18:31.959
Same thing I'm gonna do with you.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.667
If you don't hand out candy,

18:37.041 --> 18:39.208
you don't need your hand!

18:40.959 --> 18:41.875
Help me!

18:46.500 --> 18:48.291
Gotcha!

18:48.375 --> 18:50.375
- Gabe: What?
- High five. Woo!

18:52.000 --> 18:54.166
Wait. This was all a trick?

18:54.250 --> 18:57.208
That's right,
Mister nothing-scares-me-anymore.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.208
I wasn't really scared.

18:59.250 --> 19:00.250
Oh, really?

19:01.041 --> 19:02.417
Why is there a stain on your pants?

19:03.959 --> 19:04.917
There's not.

19:05.000 --> 19:06.000
Made you look!

19:06.542 --> 19:08.959
Wow, a scare and a "made you look"
all in the same day.

19:09.041 --> 19:10.583
- I am on fire!
- Yeah.

19:16.083 --> 19:19.291
It's now hour number two
of the boy-in-the-hole saga,

19:19.375 --> 19:21.208
and the tension is unbearable.

19:21.542 --> 19:24.000
Let's talk to some of Victor's
closest friends

19:24.083 --> 19:27.000
who have gathered here
for the death watch.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.583
Victor: I'm actually fine!

19:33.792 --> 19:34.750
Please, if you could,

19:34.834 --> 19:37.834
tell me in your own words
how this tragedy happened.

19:39.083 --> 19:42.417
Well, we were walking
and he fell in a hole.

19:43.417 --> 19:44.583
Fascinating.

19:45.917 --> 19:49.000
I understand you two were with Victor
when he disappeared.

19:49.083 --> 19:52.125
How is it that neither
of you fell into the hole?

19:53.000 --> 19:54.125
I don't know.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.959
The mystery deepens.

19:58.125 --> 20:00.000
I think we have time
for one more question.

20:00.083 --> 20:01.583
You, Sir, you there.

20:02.166 --> 20:04.625
- What's your name, Sir?
- Victor!

20:04.709 --> 20:08.000
- Just like the boy in the hole.
- I am the boy in the hole!

20:08.083 --> 20:12.041
Somebody finally brought me a ladder,
which I've been asking for all night!

20:15.333 --> 20:17.208
It's a Halloween miracle!

20:17.542 --> 20:19.500
This is Amy Duncan reporting.

20:23.667 --> 20:28.083
Well, Charlie, we raised
$300 for Drama Club.

20:28.709 --> 20:32.375
I mean, Victor had to spend two hours
in a hole to make it happen.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.959
But he did say that this
was his best Halloween ever.

20:37.709 --> 20:39.166
What happened to all the coasters?

20:39.834 --> 20:41.542
Um, I don't know.

20:43.125 --> 20:45.875
And why does Charlie ring a bell
every time I say the word "coasters"?

20:47.875 --> 20:48.709
Coming!

20:50.959 --> 20:53.250
And the mystery deepens.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.750
