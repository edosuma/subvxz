WEBVTT

00:19.119 --> 00:20.619
KODOS: You and your
stupid makeup.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.187
We missed Halloween!

00:24.124 --> 00:25.691
D'oh!

00:25.693 --> 00:26.692
(tires screeching)

00:26.694 --> 00:28.394
(grunts)

00:30.063 --> 00:31.897
Ooh!

00:45.145 --> 00:47.112
(yawns)

00:49.182 --> 00:50.816
CHALMERS:
<i>Ah, ah, ah.</i>

00:50.818 --> 00:53.385
I'd like to welcome
all of the principals

00:53.387 --> 00:55.587
from the Springfield
School District,

00:55.589 --> 00:57.556
including Skin-ner!

00:57.558 --> 00:58.857
Wein-berg!

00:58.859 --> 01:00.492
Sack-ett!

01:00.494 --> 01:04.329
And Gwendolyn
Hertz-feld-Mastroantonio!

01:04.331 --> 01:07.366
We are here for the annual
Dance of the Lemons,

01:07.368 --> 01:09.168
where each of you gets to trade

01:09.170 --> 01:11.236
your worst teacher
to another school.

01:11.238 --> 01:13.739
The union's happy,
the parents are placated,

01:13.741 --> 01:16.108
and only the children suffer.

01:16.110 --> 01:18.010
(over video, whispering):
Chalmskinn.

01:18.012 --> 01:20.045
Behold your lemons!

01:20.047 --> 01:23.949
Sociopathic child haters
who are only teachers

01:23.951 --> 01:26.885
because they got tenure
after two short years.

01:26.887 --> 01:28.387
That's mean!

01:28.389 --> 01:30.189
You know what you are.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.423
(Taser buzzing)

01:31.425 --> 01:33.025
Uh, first lemon:

01:33.027 --> 01:37.262
from Springfield Elementary,
going to West Springfield,

01:37.264 --> 01:40.999
third grade teacher,
Sticky-Fingers Stella.

01:45.271 --> 01:48.574
Now, going to
Springfield Elementary...

01:48.576 --> 01:50.576
God have mercy.

01:50.578 --> 01:53.445
Seymour, your new teacher is...

01:53.447 --> 01:54.913
Everybody pray!

01:54.915 --> 01:56.548
This is
a public school.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.850
I said pray!

02:01.087 --> 02:04.990
Mr. Lassen is here.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.525
No smoking.

02:08.495 --> 02:10.429
So, Mr. Lassen,

02:10.431 --> 02:13.098
you began your career
at Shelbyville Prep.

02:13.100 --> 02:15.601
It seems that certain
wealthy parents didn't like

02:15.603 --> 02:18.604
seeing their precious darlings
duct-taped to the wall.

02:18.606 --> 02:21.507
Mm-hmm. And then you entered
the public system.

02:21.509 --> 02:23.809
That's where I got this scar.

02:23.811 --> 02:25.511
What scar?

02:28.481 --> 02:30.916
Oh, I see you're left-handed.

02:30.918 --> 02:32.784
So, that concludes
my evaluation.

02:32.786 --> 02:34.153
Enjoy fourth grade.

02:35.155 --> 02:37.523
So, any dirt
on the new teacher?

02:37.525 --> 02:40.092
Is he stingy with
the pumpkin stickers?

02:40.094 --> 02:42.327
Does he have OCD?
OCD? OCD?

02:42.329 --> 02:44.263
I don't know.

02:44.265 --> 02:47.499
But in ten minutes, I'm gonna
have him kneeling before Zod.

02:47.501 --> 02:50.169
In this example, I'm Zod.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.338
(thumping)

02:53.340 --> 02:55.407
When he opens the door...

02:59.345 --> 03:01.313
That's kind of scary,

03:01.315 --> 03:03.715
but it doesn't make me
pee my pants.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.284
Hello.

03:05.286 --> 03:07.553
(screams)

03:07.555 --> 03:09.821
I'm Mr. Lassen.

03:09.823 --> 03:12.124
You mean Mr. Less-than?

03:12.126 --> 03:13.292
(students giggle)

03:13.294 --> 03:15.827
So, a comedian, are you?

03:15.829 --> 03:17.896
I got a pretty solid
ten minutes.

03:17.898 --> 03:21.200
Well, I could do five minutes
on your pathetic vest

03:21.202 --> 03:23.402
and five minutes
on your ugly buck teeth.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.470
And I've got a whole
HBO special's worth

03:25.472 --> 03:27.206
on your fat mama!

03:27.208 --> 03:30.509
My mom can't afford to be fat--
she's an exotic dancer.

03:30.511 --> 03:32.010
(chuckling):
Oh!

03:32.012 --> 03:35.514
And in what exotic
location does she dance?

03:35.516 --> 03:36.715
A Touch of Class.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.183
But the "C-L" fell off.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.385
Son, there was
never a "C-L."

03:40.387 --> 03:42.754
I-I think I always knew that!

03:42.756 --> 03:43.922
(sobbing)

03:43.924 --> 03:45.257
Bart, this guy served

03:45.259 --> 03:47.326
two tours in middle school.

03:47.328 --> 03:48.827
Abort prank!

03:48.829 --> 03:50.028
I will not.

03:50.030 --> 03:52.164
Anything to delay
a spelling test.

03:52.166 --> 03:53.665
(thumping)

03:57.437 --> 04:01.406
Looks like I've got
a prankster on my hands.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.442
(chuckles)
You know, son,

04:03.444 --> 04:05.677
school code says
a student's hair

04:05.679 --> 04:08.547
should be of
uniform length.

04:08.549 --> 04:09.781
What are you gonna do to him?

04:09.783 --> 04:11.950
Quiet... Smellson.

04:11.952 --> 04:15.320
Smellson? I prayed no one
would ever think of that!

04:17.257 --> 04:18.757
(razor buzzing)

04:18.759 --> 04:20.892
<i>Ay, caramba.</i>

04:20.894 --> 04:23.095
How was your first day
at school, Bart?

04:23.097 --> 04:24.363
Terrible.

04:24.365 --> 04:26.031
You want to talk
about it?
No.

04:26.033 --> 04:27.366
Oh, thank you.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.368
Why are you wearing
your hat at dinner?

04:29.370 --> 04:31.737
This new teacher I got
gave me a haircut.

04:31.739 --> 04:33.538
Hmm?
A haircut? Let me see.

04:33.540 --> 04:35.474
No.
Come on. Please?

04:35.476 --> 04:37.409
No, you'll laugh at me.

04:37.411 --> 04:39.177
I won't laugh at you.
Let's see.

04:40.146 --> 04:43.048
(laughing)

04:43.050 --> 04:45.550
Look at me. I'm Bart.

04:45.552 --> 04:46.952
We're sorry.

04:46.954 --> 04:49.454
(laughing)

04:50.723 --> 04:52.557
(laughing)

04:53.559 --> 04:55.761
Stop that,
all of you.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.163
It's not Bart's fault that
his haircut looks so stupid.

04:58.165 --> 05:01.600
(Homer giggles)
I didn't know that a teacher
could cut kids' hair.

05:01.602 --> 05:04.002
Teachers' union won the right
in their last strike.

05:04.004 --> 05:07.973
I'm going to go to that school
and talk to that teacher.

05:07.975 --> 05:09.641
Marge, please don't
say anything.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.076
It never makes a difference,

05:11.078 --> 05:13.078
and then the teachers
give us stink-eye

05:13.080 --> 05:15.147
during the school fairs.

05:15.149 --> 05:16.782
Well, if he's gonna get
a haircut,

05:16.784 --> 05:19.785
Bart should at least
have gotten a balloon with it.

05:19.787 --> 05:20.919
(groans)

05:20.921 --> 05:22.454
(grumbles)
Well, anyway, Bart,

05:22.456 --> 05:25.657
you'll cheer up on our
camping trip this weekend.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.925
What camping trip?

05:26.927 --> 05:29.795
The one you booked
for us at Owl Haven.

05:29.797 --> 05:33.332
The one you have to
reserve a year in advance.

05:33.334 --> 05:37.836
Oh, uh, you told me not to do it
a year ago. Remember?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.137
I don't remember that.

05:39.139 --> 05:41.139
You're right.
No one can be expected

05:41.141 --> 05:43.308
to remember something
from a year ago.

05:43.310 --> 05:45.610
Certainly not me.
Pass the gravy.

05:45.612 --> 05:48.814
(gasps) Don't tell me
you didn't reserve a campsite.

05:48.816 --> 05:52.317
Labor Day is next weekend.
There'll be nothing left.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.553
Hey, there's always room
at Buzzard's Roost.

05:54.555 --> 05:58.056
Excuse me, but Buzzard's Roost
is a converted parking lot.

05:58.058 --> 06:01.326
Excuse me, but grass
is poking through.

06:01.328 --> 06:03.395
Why do I ever put you in charge
Parking lot!

06:03.397 --> 06:04.663
of the littlest thing?
Poking through!

06:04.665 --> 06:05.797
(crying)
Parking lot!

06:05.799 --> 06:06.965
Poking through!

06:06.967 --> 06:09.368
My biggest sin
is that I dare to hope.

06:09.370 --> 06:10.836
(crying)

06:10.838 --> 06:13.672
Oh, Marge, I can't stand it
when you cry at dinner.

06:13.674 --> 06:15.507
The pork chops look traumatized.

06:15.509 --> 06:17.409
The mashed potatoes
can't stand to watch.

06:17.411 --> 06:19.711
Even the children seem upset.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.582
So trust me, I will come through
for you, baby.

06:24.917 --> 06:26.051
Not you.

06:26.919 --> 06:28.553
So what do you say, Marge?

06:28.555 --> 06:31.223
I want so much to believe you.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.658
And I want you
to believe me, too.

06:33.660 --> 06:36.228
Isn't it great
how much we agree?

06:39.365 --> 06:43.602
Looks like our blackboard
has been defaced.

06:43.604 --> 06:46.037
Lucky for you,
I can take a joke.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.873
(grunting)

06:47.875 --> 06:49.341
LISA:
Hello?

06:49.343 --> 06:50.742
Hello? Is
everything okay?

06:50.744 --> 06:53.178
Here's... Millie!

06:53.180 --> 06:56.214
Excuse me, you
ruined my report.

06:56.216 --> 06:57.783
Fine. You got an "A."

06:57.785 --> 07:00.519
Oh! Yippee!
Fourth-grade "A"!

07:00.521 --> 07:03.688
You might fool some people,
El Barto, but not me.

07:03.690 --> 07:04.856
(electrical buzzing)

07:04.858 --> 07:07.626
Now we're gonna learn
about electricity.

07:07.628 --> 07:09.761
Hey, live wire.
Come up here.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.530
Touch the generator.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.201
Even I think
this is too far.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.702
Quiet, Smellson.

07:17.704 --> 07:19.771
It's sticking.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.041
(grunting)

07:25.912 --> 07:28.647
I just need
to get to 60%.

07:33.319 --> 07:35.821
Milhouse, I'm gonna
get back at Lassen.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.155
Now, <i>The Hobbit</i> taught us

07:37.157 --> 07:39.157
that every dragon has
a chink in its armor.

07:39.159 --> 07:40.792
It also taught us

07:40.794 --> 07:42.894
that New Zealand's
beautiful landscapes

07:42.896 --> 07:44.729
and attractive
tax credits

07:44.731 --> 07:47.399
add up to a
filmmaker's paradise.

07:47.401 --> 07:53.104
For more information,
visit www.nzfilmhere.nz.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.339
To find out
Lassen's weakness,

07:54.341 --> 07:56.141
I hid a camera in
the teachers' lounge.

08:00.580 --> 08:03.582
(grunting)

08:03.584 --> 08:05.317
Ach! Wrong order!

08:08.988 --> 08:12.424
You seem lonely
and kind of weird.

08:12.426 --> 08:14.159
You left out "single."

08:14.161 --> 08:15.994
Mind if I heat up
some goulash?

08:15.996 --> 08:19.331
Let's continue this
online.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.502
I've created a fake
Ms. Hoover profile.

08:23.504 --> 08:26.838
When Lassen friends her, we'll
know everything about <i>him.</i>

08:26.840 --> 08:28.340
I don't know, Bart.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.342
You're lying
about your identity?

08:30.344 --> 08:32.344
That's against
the terms and conditions.

08:32.346 --> 08:35.780
We've all read the terms
and conditions, Milhouse.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.782
Look, I really need a campsite.

08:37.784 --> 08:40.218
My wife is making sandwiches.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.888
Sorry, reservations
are a year in advance.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.956
What about Mosquito Cove?
Booked.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.959
Skunk Canyon?
Booked every year since 2003.

08:47.961 --> 08:50.462
Ooh, how about the campsite
where the guy in the hockey mask

08:50.464 --> 08:51.696
kills all the campers?

08:51.698 --> 08:53.765
Sir, that's a movie.

08:55.034 --> 08:58.036
Hello? Hello?
This is Homer Simpson.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.038
742 Evergreen Terrace.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.507
Looking for a place
for my kids and me.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.142
And my pretty, pretty wife.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.978
You know, alarm code 3679.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.047
3679!

09:10.149 --> 09:13.151
So I hear you're
getting back at Lassen.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.320
Maybe I am. So?

09:15.322 --> 09:18.823
You got to do it, man.
He preys on the weak.

09:18.825 --> 09:21.159
Now, give me
your lunch money.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.495
I'll take that.
(whimpers)

09:24.931 --> 09:26.298
(cat screeches)

09:27.266 --> 09:29.200
Here's Lassen's profile.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.937
MILHOUSE:
What the...?

09:31.939 --> 09:34.105
BART:
Tagged as Lassen?

09:34.107 --> 09:35.440
(groans)

09:35.442 --> 09:38.843
It says these were taken
at Blazing Guy.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.845
What's Blazing Guy?

09:40.847 --> 09:42.948
Oh, that's convenient.

09:42.950 --> 09:44.683
Helloha.

09:44.685 --> 09:48.119
Do you want to make your home
in a self-sustaining city

09:48.121 --> 09:51.356
that only exists
a few days a year?

09:51.358 --> 09:54.359
<i>One that combines nudity,</i>
<i>dust storms,</i>

09:54.361 --> 09:58.029
<i>children</i>
<i>and all-consuming fires?</i>

09:58.031 --> 10:00.532
Then you, my bro or brah,

10:00.534 --> 10:03.768
are dreaming of Blazing Guy.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.770
On the last day,

10:05.772 --> 10:08.106
<i>the chosen one, or Ignis,</i>

10:08.108 --> 10:11.776
<i>sets fire</i>
<i>to the giant wooden Guy</i>

10:11.778 --> 10:16.147
<i>in a ritual dating back</i>
<i>to 1986.</i>

10:16.149 --> 10:18.149
The Blazing Guy Council
of Elders,

10:18.151 --> 10:19.884
in conjunction with Duraflame,

10:19.886 --> 10:21.720
is very pleased to announce

10:21.722 --> 10:25.390
that this year's Ignis
is Jack Lassen.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.391
(both gasp)

10:26.393 --> 10:28.226
So if we go there
with a camera

10:28.228 --> 10:29.494
to film Lassen
humiliating himself,

10:29.496 --> 10:31.730
I'll get revenge for
him making me into this.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.565
(chuckles)

10:33.567 --> 10:35.133
I was trying
to even it out.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.402
You're starting
to look like your dad.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.803
No.

10:38.805 --> 10:42.140
I'm lucky.
I look just like my mom.

10:43.275 --> 10:46.811
(grunting)

10:46.813 --> 10:50.415
Gosh, that was a hard
sleeping bag to roll up.

10:50.417 --> 10:52.417
Those were
your father's sweatpants.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.519
(sighs)
Marge,

10:54.521 --> 10:56.855
I have a confession to make
about this trip.

10:56.857 --> 10:58.189
(quietly):
Dad, don't worry.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.824
I got you a place.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.259
Hmm? Once again,

11:01.261 --> 11:03.261
I've been saved
from any consequences.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.929
It'll keep happening
till one day

11:04.931 --> 11:08.533
I create a mess so enormous
it can't be cleaned up.

11:08.535 --> 11:10.168
Thanks, boy.

11:12.038 --> 11:13.705
♪ A-camping we will go

11:13.707 --> 11:15.707
♪ But where?
I still don't know ♪

11:15.709 --> 11:18.009
♪ A place that's filled
with sun and sand ♪

11:18.011 --> 11:19.711
♪ A desert
steampunk Disneyland ♪

11:19.713 --> 11:24.616
♪ Keep expectations low...

11:24.618 --> 11:29.421
♪ Swing low, sweet chariot...

11:30.356 --> 11:32.357
Hmm.

11:35.294 --> 11:37.629
(Homer laughing)

11:37.631 --> 11:40.365
Homer Simpson,
I love you.

11:43.903 --> 11:45.303
Oh.

11:46.906 --> 11:50.475
(gasps) A world of anarchic
free expression.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.811
Cars shaped like cupcakes!

11:52.813 --> 11:54.579
I'm home.
I'm home.

11:54.581 --> 11:55.880
(gasps)

11:55.882 --> 11:58.249
No, no, no, don't
blow me out, wise guy.

11:58.251 --> 11:59.884
Not in the mood.

12:06.992 --> 12:08.326
(groans)

12:13.232 --> 12:16.935
I'm not sure this campground
is family-friendly.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.570
All camping is pointless.

12:18.572 --> 12:20.905
You drive hundreds
of miles to shower and sleep

12:20.907 --> 12:23.742
in a place with
no bathroom or beds.

12:23.744 --> 12:26.611
I guess what I'm trying
to say is: Where's Maggie?

12:26.613 --> 12:28.346
(groans, screams)

12:28.348 --> 12:31.249
We brought
Cheerios for you.

12:33.786 --> 12:36.521
Now, you know the wind
does kick up here.

12:36.523 --> 12:39.023
Hope you went three feet down
with your tent stakes.

12:39.025 --> 12:42.293
Uh, listen here,
Desert Arnaz.

12:42.295 --> 12:45.597
Homer Simpson knows
how to pitch a tent.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.435
Hey man,
can I bum a tent?

12:50.437 --> 12:51.469
(groans)

12:51.471 --> 12:52.937
You seem stressed.

12:52.939 --> 12:54.773
Have some calming tea.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.709
Finally. A normal person.

12:57.711 --> 13:00.311
Ah. Thank you, Miss, um...

13:00.313 --> 13:03.381
Calypso Self-Knowledge.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.551
Is that tea... adulterated?

13:06.553 --> 13:09.220
Does that look like
something I'd do?

13:10.790 --> 13:12.557
HOMER:
Hey, Marge.

13:12.559 --> 13:16.628
We got a new tent
from a guy who just O.D.'d.

13:17.730 --> 13:20.064
Aw, let me get
a picture of that.

13:20.066 --> 13:21.800
(alarm whooping)
(cell phone chimes)

13:23.502 --> 13:24.836
BOTH:
Aw.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.971
I think Smitty's
still inside.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.673
Oh, too bad
he's missing this.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.075
So many musical choices.

13:31.077 --> 13:32.577
A brass band.

13:32.579 --> 13:34.479
Barbershop <i>quintet?</i>

13:34.481 --> 13:36.080
The human kazoo.

13:36.082 --> 13:38.583
Oh, a drum circle.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.084
(rhythmic drumming)

13:48.427 --> 13:50.495
(peppy tooting)

13:54.934 --> 13:57.435
Uh... can I help you, freak?

13:57.437 --> 13:59.437
No.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.506
(plays a sad tune)

14:03.776 --> 14:05.610
BART:
There he is.

14:05.612 --> 14:08.847
(gasps) His nipples
are asymmetrical.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.515
This could ruin him.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.450
Milhouse, everyone here
is a total freak.

14:12.452 --> 14:15.386
We have to find a way
to completely humiliate Lassen.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.189
Get a picture of a
restaurant check with no tip,

14:18.191 --> 14:20.458
put it online,
say it was him.

14:20.460 --> 14:22.193
Kaboom, he's finished.

14:26.298 --> 14:27.866
Mmm.

14:30.236 --> 14:32.637
Oh.

14:32.639 --> 14:35.373
Suddenly this place

14:35.375 --> 14:37.742
doesn't seem so bad.

14:37.744 --> 14:39.244
This place is great.

14:39.246 --> 14:41.813
Just have to avoid these
inseam-high cactuses.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.414
Hup, hup.

14:43.416 --> 14:45.083
D'oh!

14:45.085 --> 14:48.887
Oh. Are you Mr. Clean?

14:48.889 --> 14:51.823
(scoffs) Compared to the rest
of these people, yeah.

14:51.825 --> 14:54.158
So give the Tooth Fairy
my forwarding address,

14:54.160 --> 14:56.394
'cause it's pretty loose.

14:56.396 --> 14:59.063
About time.
It's the only phone.

14:59.065 --> 15:01.165
You don't count.

15:02.601 --> 15:05.570
Maybe we should just
give up on Lassen.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.939
No. This Ignis thing is
the biggest deal of his life.

15:07.941 --> 15:09.274
And I'm gonna wreck it.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.776
Because he scarred me forever.

15:11.778 --> 15:13.678
Hey, it grew back.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.079
A little better, even.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.848
So full and lush.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.082
Enough.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.018
Mmm.

15:20.020 --> 15:21.686
It's like someone ironed out

15:21.688 --> 15:25.189
all the wrinkles in my brain.

15:25.191 --> 15:26.591
(gasps)

15:26.593 --> 15:28.660
(upbeat tune plays)

15:53.552 --> 15:56.287
(wind whistling)

15:57.489 --> 16:00.191
Get in the tent.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.865
D'oh!

16:10.169 --> 16:12.570
Oh, you always
save me,

16:12.572 --> 16:14.505
trombone elephant.

16:14.507 --> 16:17.375
(imitates elephant)

16:20.779 --> 16:22.747
Hmm.

16:22.749 --> 16:24.148
BART:
Fire retardant?

16:26.318 --> 16:29.520
If Lassen can't light
that thing, he'll be humiliated.

16:29.522 --> 16:32.490
What good is an Ignis
who can't blaze the guy?

16:32.492 --> 16:34.158
I'm scared, Bart.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.094
And I am never scared.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.429
(gasps)

16:38.431 --> 16:39.998
Hideous.

16:50.709 --> 16:53.277
(loud beeping)

16:53.279 --> 16:55.279
These kids are gonna
ruin the ceremony.

16:55.281 --> 16:57.348
It's too bad
I'm just an illusion.

17:06.692 --> 17:08.192
Homie,
you promised me

17:08.194 --> 17:10.194
an incredible
camping trip,

17:10.196 --> 17:11.729
and I got one.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.564
Just like I planned.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.200
You got very lucky this time.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.802
Don't push it.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.203
I understand.

17:19.205 --> 17:22.140
I already signed up
for this place next year.

17:22.142 --> 17:25.977
I gave my form
and $200 cash to that dude.

17:25.979 --> 17:27.812
D'oh!

17:27.814 --> 17:30.381
(drums, saxophone,
kazoo playing)

17:32.818 --> 17:36.087
Ignis, approach the Burning Man.

17:36.089 --> 17:38.656
I mean Blazing Guy.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.570
(crowd groaning)

17:54.606 --> 17:56.707
Get the job done.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.342
You're not helping.

18:03.015 --> 18:05.016
(crowd boos, hisses)

18:05.018 --> 18:07.418
Strip him of his nudity.

18:12.524 --> 18:14.592
(laughing)

18:18.097 --> 18:20.098
You.
(both gasp)

18:20.100 --> 18:21.866
Maybe we won't have Blazing Guy,

18:21.868 --> 18:23.434
but we can still have...

18:23.436 --> 18:25.303
blazing boy.

18:25.305 --> 18:26.704
What, uh...

18:26.706 --> 18:29.207
(tooting)
(screaming)

18:33.712 --> 18:36.214
Help me, desert weirdos.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.382
(both gasp)

18:38.384 --> 18:39.951
I'll take those.

18:43.555 --> 18:46.390
Beware the butterfly's
sting.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.159
What the...?

18:48.161 --> 18:49.293
(creaks)

18:52.965 --> 18:54.499
Form a human prison

18:54.501 --> 18:57.635
and hold him for five days.

19:00.839 --> 19:03.241
No.
(grunts)

19:03.243 --> 19:05.243
Wait, how
many days?

19:05.245 --> 19:07.645
(laughing)

19:07.647 --> 19:09.514
Hey, listen, we should
probably get home.

19:09.516 --> 19:11.015
My dad forgot
to bring water.

19:11.017 --> 19:12.316
(smacks tongue)

19:15.420 --> 19:19.257
Whoa. When will this tea
get out of my system?

19:20.759 --> 19:22.827
(upbeat tune plays)

19:35.541 --> 19:37.275
Haw-haw!

19:38.677 --> 19:40.678
What the...?

19:45.384 --> 19:49.020
According to this file from
Blazing Guy Secret Security,

19:49.022 --> 19:51.122
your behavior was so egregious

19:51.124 --> 19:54.025
we can do something
that we've never done before:

19:54.027 --> 19:55.393
fire a teacher.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.461
Hand in your red pen.

20:01.133 --> 20:04.202
Oh. Not gonna pass
fingernail inspection tonight.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.703
So where do you go
from here?

20:05.705 --> 20:08.306
A place where my talents
will be appreciated.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.374
All right, lights out.

20:13.912 --> 20:15.313
You, too, freak.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.315
(groans)

20:17.317 --> 20:19.150
You hate him, too?

20:19.152 --> 20:22.320
With every fiber of what's left
of my wretched soul.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.488
We should team up.
I can get you out of here.

20:24.490 --> 20:26.891
A partner? Intriguing.
Who gets to gut him

20:26.893 --> 20:28.526
like a little
pot-bellied salmon?

20:28.528 --> 20:30.728
I assumed we'd take turns.
No deal.
