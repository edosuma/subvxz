WEBVTT

00:04.803 --> 00:07.306
Bobcats, in the city.
Seriously.

00:07.816 --> 00:09.402
Habitat's just over those hills.

00:09.681 --> 00:10.608
Who doesn't like
to come into town

00:10.609 --> 00:12.100
for a nice meal
every now and then, hmm?

00:12.125 --> 00:14.348
I thought this job this job
was about dogs and cats.

00:14.644 --> 00:17.087
Well, it's just like a cat,
named Bob.

00:17.772 --> 00:20.274
Look, bobcats are more scared
of us than we are of them.

00:20.308 --> 00:21.909
Oh, my God.

00:21.943 --> 00:23.277
There it is.

00:23.311 --> 00:24.578
Wait till you
see the teeth

00:24.612 --> 00:26.847
on these suckers.

00:26.881 --> 00:28.448
Come on, come on.
Hey, hey.

00:28.483 --> 00:29.683
You can always
get laid with a story

00:29.717 --> 00:31.118
about catching
a bobcat.

00:31.152 --> 00:32.719
Now slowly go
behind the Dumpster.

00:34.000 --> 00:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:51.005 --> 00:51.972
I-I got him!

00:52.006 --> 00:53.941
Okay, now hand
him over.

00:56.744 --> 00:58.412
Get a sample of what
he was feeding on,

00:58.446 --> 00:59.713
in case he gets sick.

01:02.817 --> 01:05.052
Hurry up!

01:05.086 --> 01:06.520
There's a lot
of stuff here.

01:06.554 --> 01:08.121
If he craps in this van,
you're cleaning it up.

01:08.156 --> 01:09.790
I got it.

01:09.824 --> 01:11.158
He was feeding
on this.

01:13.661 --> 01:17.164
Okay... and now you're going to
learn about paperwork.

01:23.171 --> 01:24.805
<i>This is the third letter</i>
<i>I've gotten</i>

01:24.839 --> 01:26.340
from a collection agency.

01:26.374 --> 01:28.075
They probably just mixed you up
with someone else.

01:28.109 --> 01:30.143
No, they all have my
Social Security number,

01:30.178 --> 01:31.645
correct address...

01:31.679 --> 01:33.313
But I know I didn't buy

01:33.348 --> 01:36.049
a portable tool shed
for $1,800.

01:36.084 --> 01:37.951
It's nice,
riding in together.

01:37.986 --> 01:40.053
Easier than going back
to separate places.

01:40.088 --> 01:41.955
That was subtle.

01:41.990 --> 01:44.124
And now that you have that tool shed,
we'd have plenty of room.

01:46.527 --> 01:48.395
Oh, man, now what?

01:48.429 --> 01:50.263
<i>With this car,</i>
<i>it could be anything.</i>

01:50.298 --> 01:52.699
<i>Hey! I got the taillight</i>
<i>fixed, and the exhaust.</i>

01:52.734 --> 01:54.101
<i>Well, you definitely</i>
<i>weren't speeding.</i>

01:54.135 --> 01:55.615
I don't think you
could in this thing.

02:00.842 --> 02:02.242
License and
registration, sir.

02:02.276 --> 02:04.177
Ma'am.
Of course.

02:04.212 --> 02:05.379
Excuse me, Officer,

02:05.413 --> 02:07.014
can I ask why you
pulled us over?

02:07.048 --> 02:08.115
Doesn't really
concern you, ma'am.

02:08.149 --> 02:09.316
Why don't you sit back

02:09.350 --> 02:11.251
while your boyfriend
does what I asked?

02:11.285 --> 02:12.953
"Boyfriend"? Okay.

02:12.987 --> 02:14.744
I think it's pretty clear
why you pulled us over.

02:14.769 --> 02:15.689
Cam.

02:15.690 --> 02:17.557
He was driving
erratically, ma'am.

02:17.592 --> 02:19.192
Uh, no, he was
driving while brown.

02:19.227 --> 02:20.560
Let it go, Cam.
No.

02:20.595 --> 02:21.995
I'd listen
to him, ma'am.

02:22.030 --> 02:23.397
What is it?

02:23.431 --> 02:25.132
Did you do a little time
in the Middle East, maybe?

02:25.166 --> 02:26.400
You didn't like
the way he looked?

02:26.434 --> 02:27.634
Or maybe me?

02:27.668 --> 02:28.635
I.D., ma'am.
Oh, seriously?

02:28.669 --> 02:30.871
Now!

02:30.905 --> 02:32.172
I am the Head of
the Forensic Division

02:32.206 --> 02:33.407
at the Jeffersonian
Institution.

02:33.441 --> 02:36.009
And I am on my way
to a case, so...

02:36.044 --> 02:37.511
Let it go.
It's a stupid ticket.

02:37.545 --> 02:38.612
No. I will not let
something like this go,

02:38.646 --> 02:40.347
and neither should you.

02:40.381 --> 02:41.982
You know
there's a fine line...

02:42.016 --> 02:43.450
Warrants
outstanding for check fraud,

02:43.484 --> 02:45.218
credit card fraud and
grand theft-- arrest on sight.

02:45.253 --> 02:46.373
...be allowed to pull
you over for no reason?

02:46.374 --> 02:47.243
Out of the car!

02:47.255 --> 02:48.455
What?
Out of the car.

02:48.489 --> 02:50.424
Now.
Oh! Oh, my God...

02:50.458 --> 02:52.325
What is going on?
What the hell is going on?

02:52.360 --> 02:53.603
Camille Saroyan,
step out of the car.

02:53.628 --> 02:54.594
What?

02:54.595 --> 02:55.871
Turn around and step
away from the car, please.

02:55.896 --> 02:57.030
Okay.

02:57.031 --> 02:59.187
You're under arrest for check
and credit card fraud, and grand theft.

02:59.287 --> 03:01.287
What?
No, there must be some mistake.

03:01.335 --> 03:03.003
I'd stay out of this
if I were you, buddy.

03:03.037 --> 03:04.371
You have the right
to remain silent.

03:04.405 --> 03:05.372
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

03:05.406 --> 03:06.540
in a court of law.
You have the right

03:06.574 --> 03:07.841
to an attorney.
If you cannot afford an attorney,

03:07.875 --> 03:09.009
an attorney will be
appointed for you...

03:09.043 --> 03:11.611
Look, I can't believe
anyone would think

03:11.646 --> 03:13.013
she was capable
of check fraud.

03:13.047 --> 03:14.548
Of course
she's capable.

03:14.582 --> 03:16.016
What are you
talking about?

03:16.050 --> 03:17.584
I don't believe she did it.

03:17.618 --> 03:19.219
But she certainly has
the intellectual acumen for it.

03:19.253 --> 03:21.288
Okay. You definitely
should not be a character witness.

03:21.322 --> 03:23.423
Whoa. No hazardous
waste accepted...

03:23.458 --> 03:24.691
What is this?

03:24.725 --> 03:25.859
Wow, bobcat feast.

03:25.893 --> 03:27.294
Judging by the use of debris

03:27.328 --> 03:28.895
to cover the remains
between feedings,

03:28.930 --> 03:30.997
our victim's been here
at least six hours.

03:31.032 --> 03:33.411
Hey, is Cam out of
the hoosegow yet?

03:33.436 --> 03:34.201
Yeah,
I called in

03:34.202 --> 03:35.602
a favor, had the bail
hearing moved up.

03:35.636 --> 03:36.937
She should be out
in a few hours.

03:36.971 --> 03:38.305
Whoa, hello.

03:38.339 --> 03:40.107
Puncture marks on
the head of the humerus

03:40.141 --> 03:42.776
indicate that the bobcat severed

03:42.810 --> 03:44.177
the arms from the body.

03:44.212 --> 03:45.879
- What's that smell?
- Oh, yeah.

03:45.913 --> 03:47.781
Bobcats? They mark
their feeding area

03:47.815 --> 03:50.717
with urine and,
if you're lucky, feces.

03:50.751 --> 03:52.586
Look, was this guy alive
when he was ripped apart?

03:52.620 --> 03:55.222
I mean, is this something
we should be even involved in?

03:55.256 --> 03:57.524
If Dr. Saroyan wasn't
incarcerated, she'd note that

03:57.558 --> 03:59.926
the decomposition of this tissue

03:59.961 --> 04:01.895
indicates that the victim
was dead six to 12 hours before

04:01.929 --> 04:04.030
the bobcat started feeding.
So it was a body dump.

04:04.065 --> 04:05.098
Have you found the skull,
Dr. Hodgins?

04:05.133 --> 04:06.166
No...

04:06.200 --> 04:08.568
Bobcats often carry their food

04:08.603 --> 04:10.337
into trees
to consume it.

04:14.976 --> 04:18.077
Well, there we go.

04:18.112 --> 04:22.782
Yep. Our animal friends
are so predictable.

04:23.484 --> 04:25.619
Feces.

04:25.653 --> 04:28.155
It's your lucky day, Bug Boy.

04:31.058 --> 04:32.332
Awesome.

The extensive
number of fractures

05:06.457 --> 05:07.924
evident on these X-rays

05:07.959 --> 05:09.860
indicate blunt force trauma
as cause of death.

05:09.894 --> 05:11.595
Yeah, lots of blunt force
and lots of trauma,

05:11.629 --> 05:12.996
by the looks of it.

05:13.030 --> 05:14.431
And completed ossification
of the clavicle

05:14.465 --> 05:17.067
indicates the victim
was in his early 30s, and...

05:17.101 --> 05:18.435
Arastoo?

05:18.469 --> 05:20.303
Yeah, sorry.

05:20.338 --> 05:22.005
I'm still...

05:22.039 --> 05:24.441
it was like Cam was daring
the cop to bust her.

05:24.475 --> 05:25.876
Was the cop racist?

05:25.910 --> 05:26.877
You could take it
that way, yeah.

05:26.911 --> 05:28.111
Racism is racism.

05:28.146 --> 05:29.312
Right, sweetie?

05:29.347 --> 05:33.049
Oh. I have found,
as a Caucasian,

05:33.084 --> 05:37.187
if I enter into any kind of
debate like this,

05:37.221 --> 05:39.456
the non-Caucasians, like you
and Arastoo, yell at me,

05:39.490 --> 05:41.491
as if I represent
all white people.

05:41.526 --> 05:43.160
I tend to represent all Muslims.

05:43.194 --> 05:45.395
I tend to represent
all hot women.

05:45.430 --> 05:47.264
I don't know if you can classify

05:47.298 --> 05:49.866
"hot women" as a race.
Excuse me?

05:49.901 --> 05:53.303
I'm about to breach security,
so if one of you could...

05:53.337 --> 05:55.972
Oh...

05:56.207 --> 05:58.074
What's wrong with your card?
The same thing that's wrong with

05:58.109 --> 06:00.176
my credit cards,
my bank card,

06:00.211 --> 06:02.112
the reason why
my online

06:02.146 --> 06:04.080
stock trading account's
been frozen...

06:04.115 --> 06:05.615
You trade in the stock market?
No.

06:05.650 --> 06:07.550
Apparently, I've been the victim
of identity theft.

06:07.585 --> 06:08.785
You got arrested

06:08.819 --> 06:10.453
because someone else
broke the law?

06:10.488 --> 06:12.188
Using my identity, yes.

06:12.223 --> 06:13.356
And it's still happening.

06:13.391 --> 06:14.624
But I really don't want

06:14.659 --> 06:15.859
to deal with this at work,

06:15.893 --> 06:17.360
so let's drop it, okay?

06:17.395 --> 06:18.795
What do you mean,
it's still happening?

06:18.829 --> 06:19.829
Until they catch whoever

06:19.864 --> 06:21.331
stole her identity, they can...

06:21.365 --> 06:22.599
This is not dropping it.

06:22.633 --> 06:23.967
The brain seems
to be the only organ

06:24.001 --> 06:25.335
that the bobcat
didn't get at.

06:25.369 --> 06:27.037
Okay, with all this damage,

06:27.071 --> 06:29.439
the facial reconstruction
is gonna take a while.

06:29.473 --> 06:31.574
The victim has areas
of very dense bone

06:31.609 --> 06:33.643
around his pelvis
and vertebral spine.

06:33.678 --> 06:34.644
Also, calcification

06:34.679 --> 06:35.812
of the lateral

06:35.846 --> 06:37.380
and medial
collateral ligaments.

06:37.415 --> 06:38.381
Skeletal fluorosis?

06:38.416 --> 06:39.816
How is that possible?

06:39.850 --> 06:41.084
There's no evidence
of bone deformation.

06:41.118 --> 06:42.485
Early stages.

06:42.520 --> 06:44.854
And extremely rare
in North America.

06:44.889 --> 06:46.523
Any diagnosed cases

06:46.557 --> 06:48.491
would be reported to
the Department of Public Health.

06:48.526 --> 06:50.694
Very good, then, Mr. Vaziri.

06:50.728 --> 06:53.063
If our victim sought treatment
in the U.S.,

06:53.097 --> 06:54.497
it means he's registered.

06:57.768 --> 07:00.170
Hey. Sweets.

07:00.204 --> 07:01.438
Got an identity
on the victim.

07:01.472 --> 07:02.752
He was single, right?
His clothes

07:02.773 --> 07:04.040
and his lack of ring...

07:04.075 --> 07:06.309
Married.
Blue collar?

07:06.343 --> 07:08.545
Management consultant.
Also, Korean.

07:08.579 --> 07:10.580
I got everything wrong?
Well, you know what?

07:10.614 --> 07:12.749
Not everything. I mean,
you did say that he was a guy.

07:12.783 --> 07:13.850
Okay?

07:13.884 --> 07:15.251
Come on, you know,

07:15.286 --> 07:16.786
everybody has a bad day.
You know what you do?

07:16.821 --> 07:18.688
You just gotta walk it off,
all right, buddy?

07:18.723 --> 07:20.657
Get back in the game.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.325
Adam Pak.

07:22.359 --> 07:24.745
Is there anything in the
missing persons database?

07:24.770 --> 07:25.695
Nope.

07:25.696 --> 07:27.397
So, then, why didn't
his wife report him missing?

07:27.431 --> 07:29.699
Well, that's your department.
Come on, let's go! Get into it.

07:29.734 --> 07:31.735
It's time to, you know,
regain your self-respect...

07:31.769 --> 07:33.036
Oh, look at that.

07:33.070 --> 07:34.337
Noodle soup.

07:34.371 --> 07:35.839
"Asian Noodle Fun."
That's good.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.073
Wait, those are
my noodles.

07:37.108 --> 07:38.775
They're mine now.

07:38.809 --> 07:40.944
Adam's... dead?

07:40.978 --> 07:42.212
Are you sure it's him?

07:42.246 --> 07:44.647
God, I can't... oh...

07:44.682 --> 07:45.849
You'll be
all right.

07:45.883 --> 07:47.250
Just deep breaths,
in and out.

07:47.284 --> 07:48.685
What's wrong with her?
Well...

07:48.719 --> 07:49.919
I think we'll find

07:49.954 --> 07:51.221
that Mrs. Pak suffers from

07:51.255 --> 07:52.856
a panic disorder,
am I correct?

07:52.890 --> 07:54.390
No, I'm just
trying not to cry.

07:56.093 --> 07:57.927
Okay, when was the last time
you saw your husband?

07:57.962 --> 07:59.229
Three days ago.

07:59.263 --> 08:01.064
He left on a business trip
to Thailand.

08:01.098 --> 08:02.732
He was a management consultant.
Yes.

08:02.767 --> 08:04.400
Um, lots of international
clients, so he...

08:04.435 --> 08:05.735
he travels a lot.

08:05.770 --> 08:07.070
Did you speak to him
while he was away?

08:07.104 --> 08:09.038
- Last night.
- I bet he calls you

08:09.073 --> 08:10.406
every night when he's away,
doesn't he?

08:10.441 --> 08:11.407
No, I called him.

08:11.442 --> 08:13.076
Any reason why

08:13.110 --> 08:14.377
you would call him?

08:14.411 --> 08:16.412
I heard someone downstairs.

08:16.447 --> 08:17.781
I thought it was Adam,

08:17.815 --> 08:19.315
so I called to make sure.

08:19.350 --> 08:21.351
He told me I was imagining
things, like always.

08:21.385 --> 08:23.219
And then h-he hung up and
I called the security company.

08:23.254 --> 08:24.387
I bet they told you

08:24.421 --> 08:26.689
that you were right
to call, though.

08:26.724 --> 08:28.558
No, they think
I'm crazy nervous.

08:28.592 --> 08:29.759
I called them three
or more times

08:29.794 --> 08:32.028
during the night.
Mrs. Pak,

08:32.062 --> 08:33.395
you realize that
your husband,

08:33.429 --> 08:34.831
he wasn't killed
in Thailand.

08:34.865 --> 08:37.634
He was found here
in the United States.

08:37.668 --> 08:39.102
Can you think of any reason,
you know, I don't know,

08:39.135 --> 08:40.403
why he would lie to you?

08:40.437 --> 08:42.438
I mean, he must have
had a good reason.

08:42.472 --> 08:44.174
But you were here
all of last night?

08:44.207 --> 08:46.009
Like I told you.
If you don't believe me,

08:46.043 --> 08:47.577
ask the security company.

08:52.616 --> 08:54.284
What will I do without Adam?

08:58.022 --> 08:59.422
What do you got?

08:59.456 --> 09:01.057
Advice about
identity theft.

09:01.091 --> 09:02.425
Thanks,
but no thanks.

09:02.459 --> 09:04.527
I found traces
of agricultural lime

09:04.562 --> 09:06.196
on the victim's
clothing.

09:06.230 --> 09:07.463
I'm guessing you're not
talking about a fruit.

09:07.498 --> 09:08.998
It's a substance

09:09.033 --> 09:11.434
used to make acidic soil
more habitable for plants.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.603
How common is it?
It's fairly common.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.505
And a recent study
in Tennessee

09:15.539 --> 09:17.540
showed that the presence
of agricultural lime

09:17.575 --> 09:19.542
actually increases
bobcat visitation rates.

09:19.577 --> 09:23.546
So the lime attracted
the bobcat to his remains.

09:23.581 --> 09:26.449
There are warrants out
for your arrest.

09:26.483 --> 09:27.883
Your credit score's
gonna flat line.

09:27.885 --> 09:29.352
You're not gonna
be able to get money

09:29.386 --> 09:30.787
out of an ATM,

09:30.821 --> 09:32.388
your assets are going
to end up being frozen...

09:32.423 --> 09:34.324
I also found Chironomidae

09:34.358 --> 09:36.492
from the nematoceran
fly family...

09:39.096 --> 09:40.597
And soil.

09:40.631 --> 09:42.966
Soil with a...
it's a very high acidic ratio

09:43.000 --> 09:44.300
and greater clay
subsoil component.

09:44.335 --> 09:46.669
Can you cross-reference?

09:46.704 --> 09:48.504
Seriously?

09:48.539 --> 09:50.406
There's only one place

09:50.441 --> 09:51.841
where these both coexist...

09:51.876 --> 09:55.478
it's on Native American
tribal land in Virginia.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.248
Our Korean victim was killed
on an Indian reservation?

09:58.282 --> 09:59.816
Your wages will be garnished.

09:59.850 --> 10:01.751
You need a lawyer.

10:01.785 --> 10:02.986
I'm pretty sure

10:03.020 --> 10:04.654
I can handle this on my own.
Cam.

10:04.688 --> 10:06.923
You got blocked from
the forensic platform.

10:06.957 --> 10:08.658
You need a lawyer.

10:08.692 --> 10:11.928
And one that's gonna trust
you because he trusts me.

10:14.064 --> 10:15.765
Thank you.

10:16.734 --> 10:18.101
Thank you.

10:18.135 --> 10:19.669
If I leave now,

10:19.703 --> 10:21.371
you're not gonna come up
with another clue, are you?

10:21.405 --> 10:23.206
I'm all out.

10:29.513 --> 10:30.880
<i>I should probably leave</i>

10:30.915 --> 10:32.548
before Booth gets home.

10:32.583 --> 10:33.850
Yes, you should.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.919
Really?

10:35.953 --> 10:38.554
Angela, you're being
very mean to him.

10:39.924 --> 10:41.591
Anger is a reasonable response.

10:41.625 --> 10:42.992
Why aren't you
mad at him?

10:43.027 --> 10:45.561
I mean, he forces you
to propose to him,

10:45.596 --> 10:46.896
he accepts,

10:46.931 --> 10:48.798
and then he
changes his mind.

10:48.832 --> 10:50.333
He has his reasons.

10:50.367 --> 10:52.402
Yeah? What reasons?

10:52.436 --> 10:53.870
I don't know.

10:53.904 --> 10:55.605
Then why aren't you
angry at him?

10:55.639 --> 10:59.309
I don't know why Mars
lost its magnetic field.

10:59.343 --> 11:01.044
I'm not angry at Mars.

11:01.078 --> 11:03.079
That's fine, I'll be
angry at both Booth

11:03.113 --> 11:04.714
and Mars for you.

11:05.849 --> 11:08.418
Oh...

11:08.452 --> 11:10.820
Awkward.

11:12.156 --> 11:14.824
Bye, sweetie.

11:14.858 --> 11:16.626
Bye.

11:16.660 --> 11:18.494
Good-bye. That's the best word
I've heard all day.

11:18.529 --> 11:22.532
So, part of the Indian tribal
land is being leased

11:22.566 --> 11:24.968
to a company called
New Dawn Retreat.

11:25.002 --> 11:26.536
What's that?
It's a marriage retreat.

11:26.570 --> 11:28.037
Get this, okay?

11:28.072 --> 11:30.373
One of the registered couples
was under the name

11:30.407 --> 11:32.408
of Adam and Kelly Pak.

11:32.443 --> 11:34.911
But the victim's wife
was at home and...

11:34.945 --> 11:36.346
her name is Emma.

11:36.380 --> 11:37.613
Getting permission

11:37.648 --> 11:39.849
for the FBI to go
onto tribal land--

11:39.883 --> 11:41.851
that takes months, you know?

11:41.885 --> 11:44.320
And this marriage retreat
is over in two days.

11:44.355 --> 11:47.323
By that time, any witnesses will
have left the retreat.

11:47.358 --> 11:49.225
And possibly the killer.

11:49.259 --> 11:51.127
So, you know what I'm thinking?

11:53.864 --> 11:55.331
Undercover.

11:55.366 --> 11:56.366
Yeah.

11:56.400 --> 11:57.533
Buck and Wanda.

11:57.568 --> 11:58.801
Not Buck and Wanda.

11:58.836 --> 12:00.136
Yeah?
This is a job for...

12:00.170 --> 12:02.105
Tony, Roxie.

12:02.139 --> 12:03.906
Tony and Roxie.
Yeah!

12:03.941 --> 12:06.776
Okay, you've got it, big boy!
How you doin', baby?

12:06.810 --> 12:08.878
Yeah, how you doin'?
No, no, no, it's-it's, "How you doin'?"

12:08.912 --> 12:11.914
How ya doin'?
No, you're using your nose too much.

12:15.950 --> 12:18.035
You'll be joining our
introductory group;

12:18.036 --> 12:20.344
people like yourselves
who are finally brave enough

12:20.345 --> 12:21.878
to confront their problems.

12:21.879 --> 12:23.476
Oh, no, no,
we got no problems.

12:23.477 --> 12:24.710
Oh, we got
problems, Tony.

12:24.745 --> 12:25.734
What are you talking about?
Come on...

12:25.735 --> 12:26.393
Slow down.

12:26.394 --> 12:27.728
I think we fit pretty good

12:27.762 --> 12:29.463
in all the right places, huh?

12:29.497 --> 12:30.597
Without opening
your hearts

12:30.632 --> 12:31.899
and letting love
bathe the pain,

12:31.933 --> 12:33.200
you'll never grow
to the oneness

12:33.234 --> 12:34.401
you need to flourish.

12:34.436 --> 12:36.403
Look at them.

12:36.438 --> 12:38.005
Look how united they are.

12:38.039 --> 12:40.174
Whoa-whoa-whoa!
Everybody, slow down!

12:40.208 --> 12:41.888
We don't have to do
any of that stuff, huh?

12:41.910 --> 12:44.044
That's an advanced
course.

12:44.079 --> 12:46.080
Those couples have already taken
both the introductory

12:46.114 --> 12:47.748
and intermediate
sessions.

12:49.017 --> 12:50.184
They got problems,
you know advanced problems.

12:50.218 --> 12:51.985
Well, lots and lots
of money for you,

12:52.020 --> 12:53.120
I imagine,
Mr. Little River.

12:53.154 --> 12:54.488
All right,
take it easy on him,

12:54.522 --> 12:55.989
okay, Roxie?

12:56.024 --> 12:57.257
Listen, the guy's
trying to run a business.

12:57.292 --> 12:58.659
He likes helping people.

12:58.693 --> 13:00.494
All feeling
and no brains, this one.

13:00.528 --> 13:02.529
The majority of the money goes
back into the facility

13:02.564 --> 13:05.466
and for research
into the psycho-structure

13:05.500 --> 13:06.733
of interpersonal
relations.

13:06.768 --> 13:08.317
Okay, one thing
I don't understand

13:08.318 --> 13:09.685
is this guy right here.

13:09.719 --> 13:12.087
Then perhaps you use your head

13:12.121 --> 13:13.422
too much...

13:13.456 --> 13:14.656
Slow down.

13:14.691 --> 13:18.060
...and your heart not enough.

13:20.938 --> 13:22.816
You know,
he makes a good point.

13:22.817 --> 13:23.917
Seriously?
Just saying, Bones.

13:23.952 --> 13:25.219
Seriously?!

13:25.253 --> 13:27.521
Okay, stop-- just keep
the act up, will ya?

13:27.555 --> 13:31.125
Hemorrhagic staining on the
inside of the frontal bone.

13:31.159 --> 13:32.926
Perimortem fractures
to the skull, ribs,

13:32.961 --> 13:34.641
pelvis and the proximal end
of both femurs.

13:34.662 --> 13:36.230
Brittle bones.

13:36.264 --> 13:39.533
That would account for the
severity of the fractures.

13:39.567 --> 13:40.834
Making it hard to determine
the true force

13:40.869 --> 13:42.403
with which he was struck.

13:42.437 --> 13:44.705
Which makes it tough to
determine what he was hit with.

13:51.012 --> 13:52.446
Damn.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.214
The manager at
my bank can't help.

13:54.249 --> 13:56.083
He's gonna have to freeze
all the accounts

13:56.117 --> 13:57.251
until this is worked out.

13:57.285 --> 13:58.352
And your credit cards?

13:58.386 --> 14:00.988
All canceled. All of them.

14:01.022 --> 14:03.157
What about Hodgins' lawyer?
I didn't think I'd need him.

14:03.191 --> 14:04.858
Why do you always
refuse help?

14:04.893 --> 14:07.161
You need him. And I'll give you
some money until...

14:07.195 --> 14:08.362
No, thank you.

14:08.396 --> 14:10.364
But I can take care
of this myself.

14:10.398 --> 14:11.465
Cam...

14:11.499 --> 14:12.533
No.

14:12.567 --> 14:14.101
Okay.

14:14.135 --> 14:16.603
So I guess you won't
let me pay for dinner either.

14:16.638 --> 14:18.705
Can I at least suggest
a Dumpster

14:18.740 --> 14:20.908
that you might enjoy,
behind the supermarket?

14:20.942 --> 14:22.943
I never should have
brought this up at work.

14:22.977 --> 14:25.546
Of course not.
That's for normal people.

14:25.580 --> 14:28.348
I just, I need
to focus on the case.

14:28.383 --> 14:30.584
Something I can control.

14:30.618 --> 14:32.553
You understand.

14:32.587 --> 14:34.721
I do.

14:34.756 --> 14:35.956
So?

14:35.990 --> 14:37.124
Okay...

14:37.158 --> 14:39.193
so here's what
I got so far.

14:39.227 --> 14:41.528
Based on the angles
of the segmented fracture

14:41.563 --> 14:43.430
in the left femur, I realized

14:43.465 --> 14:45.666
there's a dual directionality
to the victim's injuries.

14:45.700 --> 14:47.701
Basically, he was smacked
from one direction

14:47.735 --> 14:50.255
and then smacked from the other
direction almost simultaneously.

14:50.271 --> 14:52.139
So, two assailants?

14:52.173 --> 14:54.241
That complicates things.

14:54.275 --> 14:57.778
Yeah. That should take your mind
off your problems for a while.

15:00.548 --> 15:02.749
We're supposed to be
doing our exercises

15:02.784 --> 15:04.251
even if Shaman Little River
isn't here.

15:04.285 --> 15:06.320
He said.

15:06.354 --> 15:08.789
So you're the perfect one,
like always.

15:08.823 --> 15:10.657
Word of advice, pet,

15:10.692 --> 15:13.160
if you want to live to our age,
take a breath.

15:13.194 --> 15:14.228
What, you think

15:14.262 --> 15:15.596
we make 72 look good?

15:15.630 --> 15:18.632
Well, maybe <i>you're</i>
in your 70s, old man,

15:18.666 --> 15:20.267
but I am...

15:20.301 --> 15:22.402
Look, the boys have got
marriage problems, Evelyn.

15:22.437 --> 15:23.670
They're not blind.

15:23.705 --> 15:24.872
Everyone,

15:24.906 --> 15:29.409
this is Tony and Roxie Scallion.

15:29.444 --> 15:30.777
How you doin'?

15:30.812 --> 15:31.979
How you doin'?

15:32.013 --> 15:33.413
How's it going, eh?
How are ya?

15:33.448 --> 15:34.448
What's your problem, kids?
Too beautiful?

15:34.482 --> 15:37.784
Oh, thank you.
You flatter.

15:37.819 --> 15:38.785
We talked about
your hostility, Evelyn.

15:38.820 --> 15:40.454
Yeah, good luck with that.

15:40.488 --> 15:43.090
Oh, thank you, Shaman.
Kelly and Adam Pak aren't here.

15:43.124 --> 15:44.258
I went to their tent
to check, but wanted

15:44.292 --> 15:45.259
to start anyway,
like you said.

15:45.293 --> 15:46.693
Of course he did.

15:46.728 --> 15:47.694
The world would stop spinning

15:47.729 --> 15:49.730
if you weren't a good boy.

15:49.764 --> 15:52.499
His behavior has nothing
to do with the rotation of the earth, doll.

15:52.534 --> 15:53.500
I like her.

15:53.535 --> 15:54.801
So, who are the Paks?

15:54.836 --> 15:56.403
Oh, they make all of us
look happily married.

15:56.437 --> 15:58.438
Let's not worry
about other people, Evelyn.

15:58.473 --> 16:00.240
Whoa, slow down, okay?

16:00.275 --> 16:03.010
Didn't you say that we could
learn from each other, okay?

16:03.044 --> 16:04.611
What were their problems?

16:04.646 --> 16:08.081
Kelly thought Adam was holding
something back from her.

16:08.116 --> 16:10.417
And I agree. He had secrets.
You could tell.

16:10.451 --> 16:12.819
Everyone has something they're
afraid to tell their partner.

16:12.854 --> 16:15.489
But if you find
the courage to open up,

16:15.523 --> 16:18.025
it's always for the best.

16:18.059 --> 16:19.693
Tony has secrets from me.

16:19.727 --> 16:21.061
What?

16:21.095 --> 16:22.362
That must be very painful
for you.

16:22.397 --> 16:23.397
Really?

16:23.431 --> 16:24.631
Ah! What is it, Tony,

16:24.666 --> 16:27.367
getting a little something
on the side?

16:27.402 --> 16:28.602
Okay, all right,
you know what?

16:28.603 --> 16:29.770
We don't have to start
with me first.

16:29.804 --> 16:30.904
Oh, no, no, no.

16:30.939 --> 16:31.872
Out with it, Tony.

16:31.906 --> 16:33.073
Come on, huh?

16:33.107 --> 16:34.875
I have a secret
that I'll share.

16:34.909 --> 16:35.909
That's beautiful.

16:35.944 --> 16:37.210
Thank you.

16:37.245 --> 16:38.245
I never told you how much

16:38.246 --> 16:39.780
I dislike it when you wear

16:39.814 --> 16:41.248
that beer hat in the bath.

16:41.282 --> 16:42.849
You look foolish,

16:42.884 --> 16:45.352
and sometimes it makes me think
that I married a child.

16:45.386 --> 16:46.887
You're kidding me right?

16:46.921 --> 16:48.055
No, Tony, I ain't.

16:48.089 --> 16:49.623
We'll talk about the hat

16:49.657 --> 16:51.391
after you lose
that stupid African

16:51.426 --> 16:53.961
fertility statue
out of the bedroom.

16:53.995 --> 16:55.162
You know what?
On top of it,

16:55.196 --> 16:56.597
you know, you should
cut off his...

16:56.631 --> 16:58.065
We don't use anger here.

16:58.099 --> 16:59.933
But it's an
exquisite carving.

16:59.968 --> 17:02.102
I find it inspirational.

17:02.136 --> 17:03.270
I love this girl.

17:03.304 --> 17:04.304
In my experience...

17:04.339 --> 17:05.839
petty issues like this

17:05.873 --> 17:08.842
usually mask a larger secret.

17:08.876 --> 17:10.410
Like the money you don't
tell me you spend.

17:10.444 --> 17:12.412
Oh, my God. Once!

17:12.446 --> 17:13.547
That was one time.

17:13.580 --> 17:15.214
And you love the canoe!

17:15.249 --> 17:16.717
So don't, don't start.

17:16.751 --> 17:18.018
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

17:18.051 --> 17:20.319
I am so, so, so sorry
I'm late.

17:20.355 --> 17:22.489
That's okay.
Where's Adam, Kelly?

17:22.522 --> 17:23.624
I don't know.

17:23.657 --> 17:25.325
We got into a huge fight
last night,

17:25.359 --> 17:27.527
and he just ran off.

17:27.561 --> 17:29.730
I've been calling and calling,
but he's not answering.

17:29.764 --> 17:31.565
Because it's finished.

17:31.599 --> 17:34.101
I'll take her picture
so we can I.D. her.

17:34.135 --> 17:35.502
Maybe we should call
the cops.

17:35.536 --> 17:38.005
I've seen this a hundred times.

17:38.039 --> 17:39.473
Working on a relationship is
a difficult thing.

17:39.507 --> 17:41.074
And you both have
tempers, lovey.

17:41.109 --> 17:42.476
He'll be back.

17:42.510 --> 17:44.311
Until then...

17:45.513 --> 17:48.915
...let the group soothe you.

17:50.184 --> 17:51.451
One heart.

17:51.486 --> 17:53.153
Oh, yeah.

17:53.187 --> 17:55.222
Oh, one heart.
You like that.

17:55.256 --> 17:57.524
Here we go.

17:57.558 --> 18:00.394
Roxie, Tony,
It's time to meld.

18:00.428 --> 18:01.695
Bring it in here,
big guy.

18:01.729 --> 18:03.597
I don't think so.

18:03.631 --> 18:06.667
A great couple
of melders you are.

18:07.635 --> 18:08.902
There we are.

18:08.936 --> 18:10.904
Oh, you, hey!

18:10.938 --> 18:12.739
One heart.

18:12.774 --> 18:14.908
We're actually talking
eight hearts here.

18:14.942 --> 18:17.444
Most damage was
confined to his pelvis

18:17.478 --> 18:19.546
and upper femurs,
anterior and posterior.

18:19.580 --> 18:23.684
The front of his pants contained
tree bark and pine needles.

18:23.718 --> 18:25.252
But there was also
a bunch of refuse

18:25.286 --> 18:27.054
from the gardeners
in the Dumpster,

18:27.088 --> 18:29.456
so I'm sorting through it now
for genus and species.

18:29.490 --> 18:30.924
As soon as you can.

18:30.958 --> 18:32.793
I'd like to give Cam
some good news.

18:32.827 --> 18:34.861
Is it true that the prosecutor
is going ahead

18:34.896 --> 18:36.229
with the case against her?

18:36.264 --> 18:38.031
To the banks and the credit card
companies,

18:38.066 --> 18:39.499
she's just
an account number.

18:39.534 --> 18:41.301
They're not gonna drop
the charges until they

18:41.335 --> 18:42.502
get proof it wasn't her.

18:42.537 --> 18:44.104
What did the lawyer say?
You know Cam.

18:44.138 --> 18:45.939
She wanted to take
care of it herself.

18:47.875 --> 18:49.810
I like the idea of
separating the boys and girls.

18:49.844 --> 18:51.845
It would be fun to have
a little girl talk.

18:51.879 --> 18:53.146
Oh, I don't know.

18:53.181 --> 18:54.614
We've been to a lot
of these.

18:54.649 --> 18:56.349
I don't like being
away from Bill.

18:56.384 --> 18:58.685
After 38 years,
that's pretty good.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.088
Whoa! We have our fights,
but I can't imagine

19:01.122 --> 19:03.090
life without this old bat.

19:03.124 --> 19:04.791
You wrinkled old fart.

19:04.826 --> 19:07.828
So why do you keep coming
to these things?

19:07.862 --> 19:10.464
Well, we get to travel,
we're together

19:10.498 --> 19:12.532
and we get to watch
all these crazy bastards.

19:12.567 --> 19:16.837
So, Kelly Pak is probably
very entertaining, huh?

19:16.871 --> 19:19.840
Oh, you don't know
the half of it.

19:19.874 --> 19:21.508
Wait till we all
sweat together.

19:21.542 --> 19:23.577
Sweat? All sweat?

19:23.611 --> 19:25.746
Yeah, we, uh, sweat over here.

19:25.780 --> 19:26.580
Sweat over here?

19:26.614 --> 19:29.483
Sweat over there.

19:29.517 --> 19:31.818
Shaman Little River says
we come in here

19:31.853 --> 19:34.988
to sweat out the toxins
that can cause emotional pain.

19:35.022 --> 19:37.157
Well, he's wrong.
You can't sweat out toxins.

19:37.191 --> 19:39.526
A sweat lodge can actually
cause your kidneys

19:39.560 --> 19:42.362
to retain water, preventing your body
from eliminating toxins.

19:42.396 --> 19:44.331
How on earth
do you know all that?

19:46.200 --> 19:49.669
Um, reading...
you know, the magazines

19:49.704 --> 19:52.539
you find at the checkout counter
at the grocery store?

19:52.573 --> 19:55.142
That's how I know that whole
sweat-toxin thing

19:55.176 --> 19:57.077
is whole lot of New Age crapola.

19:57.111 --> 19:58.812
I mean,
if that's true,

19:58.846 --> 20:01.348
what are we doing in here?
I mean, I'm roasting.

20:01.382 --> 20:04.351
Well, traditionally, it's used
to call on our ancestors

20:04.385 --> 20:07.554
to help and guide us
through difficulty.

20:07.588 --> 20:10.423
Peyote is sometimes used
to facilitate this.

20:10.458 --> 20:12.425
Oh, I would never take drugs.

20:12.460 --> 20:13.794
You sure could use something

20:13.828 --> 20:15.829
to chill out that temper
of yours, sweetie,

20:15.863 --> 20:17.531
if you want
to keep a man.

20:17.565 --> 20:19.900
Adam will be back.

20:19.934 --> 20:21.902
Are those tears or sweat, doll?

20:21.936 --> 20:24.638
I don't want to talk about it.

20:39.854 --> 20:41.922
You having a seizure, love?

20:41.956 --> 20:43.290
I'm calling on Kelly's ancestors

20:43.324 --> 20:44.791
to help her talk.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.831
Oh, not... not my mother.

20:50.865 --> 20:53.333
Oh, please, not my mother.

20:53.367 --> 20:55.635
Ali-Frazier was
the best fight of all time

20:55.670 --> 20:56.937
Oh, you're on crack.

20:56.971 --> 20:59.806
Excuse me. We're in here
for a reason.

20:59.841 --> 21:01.575
I agree with Tony.
Yeah.

21:01.609 --> 21:03.577
Two undefeated champs slugging
it out for the belt-- oh!

21:03.611 --> 21:04.578
Winner take all.

21:04.612 --> 21:06.046
Best fight ever!

21:06.080 --> 21:08.315
You're comparing this
to Rumble in the Jungle?

21:08.349 --> 21:11.218
Ali hired Larry Holmes
to pound on him

21:11.252 --> 21:12.752
so he could take punches
from Foreman.

21:12.787 --> 21:13.987
It was a slugfest.

21:14.021 --> 21:15.488
you know?
There was no artistry.

21:15.523 --> 21:16.690
We're supposed

21:16.724 --> 21:18.291
to be talking
about our relationships.

21:18.326 --> 21:19.960
Yeah, we are, son.

21:19.994 --> 21:21.928
Talking about our relationship
with boxing.

21:21.963 --> 21:23.263
Fine.
You're all wrong!

21:23.297 --> 21:24.564
Hagler-Hearns, 1985,

21:24.599 --> 21:25.632
is the greatest fight ever.

21:25.666 --> 21:26.833
Hagler throws 42 punches

21:26.868 --> 21:29.336
to Hearns's 56
in the first round alone!

21:29.370 --> 21:31.738
Only three rounds total,
and in the end, Hagler,

21:31.772 --> 21:33.273
bleeding, knocks out Hearns
to secure his legacy

21:33.307 --> 21:35.008
as the greatest
middleweight ever.

21:35.042 --> 21:36.643
Eight minutes
of toe-to-toe

21:36.677 --> 21:38.211
bloody magic-- no contest!

21:38.246 --> 21:41.481
Now...

21:41.515 --> 21:43.216
if we could
apply to our relationships

21:43.251 --> 21:45.552
a fraction of the focus

21:45.586 --> 21:47.153
that we do to boxing,
we wouldn't need

21:47.188 --> 21:49.022
to be sweating in here,
now, would we?

21:49.056 --> 21:51.157
Fair enough.
Yeah, all right.

21:51.192 --> 21:53.493
You know what relationship
I'm really interested in?

21:53.527 --> 21:55.762
Is that, uh, who is that,
Kelly and, uh...

21:55.796 --> 21:56.997
Adam.
Adam.

21:57.031 --> 21:58.064
Oh, bad.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.266
Bad, huh? How bad?

21:59.300 --> 22:01.067
- Yeah, they had secrets.
- Secrets?

22:01.102 --> 22:02.502
You don't know that.
I know.

22:02.536 --> 22:04.471
They said they'd just
gotten married, right?

22:04.505 --> 22:06.206
But there was
no newlywed vibe.

22:06.240 --> 22:08.141
Even we had
a newlywed vibe.

22:08.175 --> 22:09.609
Well, you still do.

22:09.644 --> 22:12.145
But we're talking
about Kelly now, so...

22:12.179 --> 22:14.514
I agree, we still do.

22:14.548 --> 22:16.816
Well, you're just saying that
because we're sweating.

22:16.851 --> 22:19.452
Uh, no, I'm not.

22:19.487 --> 22:20.987
I love you.

22:21.022 --> 22:22.789
Oh, guys... oh...

22:22.823 --> 22:24.858
I think Adam was
having an affair.

22:24.892 --> 22:26.793
Kelly was crazy jealous.

22:26.827 --> 22:28.461
<i>Real Housewives</i> jealous.

22:28.496 --> 22:30.697
<i>Adam kept telling me</i>

22:30.731 --> 22:31.765
how much he loved me.

22:31.799 --> 22:33.199
All the time.

22:33.234 --> 22:35.368
Your ancestors want me
to ask you

22:35.403 --> 22:38.471
if Adam ever showed you
how much he loved you?

22:38.506 --> 22:40.173
Seriously?
Yeah.

22:40.207 --> 22:42.375
Yeah, they-they want you
to talk...

22:42.410 --> 22:44.678
um... oh!

22:44.712 --> 22:46.947
Yeah, especially your mother.

22:46.981 --> 22:49.516
I thought
he loved me.

22:49.550 --> 22:52.218
But he wouldn't leave
his damn wife.

22:52.253 --> 22:53.920
The things I said to him.

22:53.955 --> 22:55.722
And did.

22:55.756 --> 22:58.892
I hurt him so bad.

22:58.926 --> 23:00.694
I-I didn't mean to.

23:00.728 --> 23:03.630
I swear, I love Adam.

23:07.735 --> 23:09.803
You look nowhere
near ready to leave.

23:09.837 --> 23:11.538
Oh, what time is it?

23:11.572 --> 23:14.307
I got lost
researching Kelly Pak,

23:14.342 --> 23:16.176
who, of course,
is not Kelly Pak,

23:16.210 --> 23:17.811
but in actuality is
really Kelly Goodman.

23:17.812 --> 23:19.212
Wow, that takes
commitment--

23:19.246 --> 23:21.948
bringing your mistress
to a couples retreat?

23:21.983 --> 23:24.417
Yeah, Booth said they were
working out their anger issues.

23:24.452 --> 23:25.418
What are these?

23:25.453 --> 23:26.987
Oh. Shh. Quiet.

23:27.021 --> 23:28.254
Wha...?

23:28.289 --> 23:29.322
I saw Cam's name.

23:29.357 --> 23:30.357
And bank statements.

23:30.391 --> 23:31.891
Yeah.

23:31.926 --> 23:33.927
Well, I'm looking
for the fake Cam.

23:33.961 --> 23:35.228
Well, great.
Why the secrecy?

23:35.262 --> 23:36.229
Seriously?

23:36.263 --> 23:37.998
You know how Cam is.

23:38.032 --> 23:40.433
Do you know
how fabulous you are?

23:40.468 --> 23:42.135
Well, I had to
do something.

23:43.270 --> 23:44.437
Unfortunately, it's easier

23:44.472 --> 23:46.573
to find the Higgs
boson than it is

23:46.607 --> 23:47.640
to recover a
stolen identity.

23:47.675 --> 23:49.576
Mmm, nice Higgs reference.

23:49.610 --> 23:51.311
Hey, you noticed.

23:51.345 --> 23:53.847
I'm gonna keep trying.

23:53.881 --> 23:55.815
So, what's all this money?
Is that fake, too?

23:55.850 --> 23:57.350
No.

23:57.385 --> 23:59.552
This is real and it has
nothing to do with Cam.

23:59.587 --> 24:01.388
These are Kelly Goodman's
bank statements

24:01.422 --> 24:03.123
over the last year.
Oh.

24:03.157 --> 24:05.058
And that is a wire transfer

24:05.092 --> 24:07.093
for over 900 grand

24:07.128 --> 24:08.461
she received five months ago

24:08.496 --> 24:10.030
from the estate of
her last boyfriend.

24:10.064 --> 24:11.331
Estate?

24:11.365 --> 24:13.199
Yeah, he died.

24:13.234 --> 24:15.101
But not before he
changed his will.

24:15.136 --> 24:18.171
Two dead boyfriends
back to back.

24:18.205 --> 24:21.875
Looks like Kelly Goodman never
worked on those anger issues.

24:25.390 --> 24:27.284
I found fracturing
around the bony wall socket

24:27.285 --> 24:28.927
of the victim's two
upper front teeth.

24:28.928 --> 24:31.363
Well, I'm not
an expert on everything,

24:31.397 --> 24:32.964
but doesn't that happen
when your teeth knocked out?

24:32.999 --> 24:34.733
They weren't knocked out,
they were yanked out.

24:34.767 --> 24:35.801
No roots.

24:35.835 --> 24:36.935
Maybe his mistress tortured him

24:36.969 --> 24:37.936
for his financial passwords

24:37.970 --> 24:39.037
before killing him.

24:39.071 --> 24:40.305
No, you don't need to torture

24:40.339 --> 24:41.873
to get passwords. Ask Cam.

24:41.908 --> 24:44.376
Thanks for the lawyer.
Cam's all cheered up.

24:44.410 --> 24:45.744
It's still gonna
take months.

24:45.778 --> 24:46.945
You know? Maybe even years.

24:46.979 --> 24:48.847
What?!

24:48.881 --> 24:50.309
She doesn't even have
money for dinner.

24:50.310 --> 24:50.978
Trust me, man, okay?

24:50.983 --> 24:52.484
Thanks to Pelant, I know

24:52.518 --> 24:54.219
what it's like
to lose everything.

24:56.689 --> 24:58.056
I asked you here because, uh,

24:58.090 --> 25:00.158
I found this lodged
in the teeth.

25:00.193 --> 25:02.060
Well, I'll check it out.

25:02.094 --> 25:04.963
She's gonna be okay,
Arastoo, okay?

25:04.997 --> 25:07.365
Just maybe not
in the next few days.

25:07.400 --> 25:09.701
Or... weeks.

25:09.735 --> 25:12.070
Or...
I get it.

25:17.510 --> 25:19.744
Leave? You can't leave.

25:19.779 --> 25:21.413
You think about
leaving every day.

25:21.447 --> 25:23.215
No, I don't.

25:23.249 --> 25:24.749
I'm not at the top
of my game right now,

25:24.784 --> 25:25.951
so please don't lie to me.

25:25.985 --> 25:27.986
All right, fine.
I think about leaving.

25:28.020 --> 25:29.588
There you go.

25:29.622 --> 25:32.190
But I'm a wild,
free spirit artist-type

25:32.225 --> 25:34.025
with wanderlust,

25:34.060 --> 25:36.862
and you're
a tight-assed geek boy

25:36.896 --> 25:38.330
who doesn't really fit in
anywhere but here.

25:38.364 --> 25:39.631
No offense.

25:39.665 --> 25:41.533
I got into psychology
to help people.

25:41.567 --> 25:42.801
And you are.

25:42.835 --> 25:44.236
No, I'm...

25:44.270 --> 25:45.704
I mean individuals.

25:45.738 --> 25:47.005
Not just law enforcement.

25:47.039 --> 25:48.707
I'm supposed to be a healer.

25:48.741 --> 25:50.342
You remember last year,

25:50.376 --> 25:51.710
that young girl who was raped?

25:51.744 --> 25:52.978
She came to me for help.

25:53.012 --> 25:54.579
What did I do?

25:54.614 --> 25:55.981
I referred her to someone else.

25:56.015 --> 25:58.016
That's helping.
No!

25:58.050 --> 25:59.551
It's delegating.

25:59.585 --> 26:01.319
- Sweets.
- Sweets, please tell me

26:01.354 --> 26:03.255
that Kelly killed
her last boyfriend.

26:03.289 --> 26:04.689
Actually, he died
in a car accident.

26:04.724 --> 26:05.991
She was nowhere near the scene.

26:06.025 --> 26:08.193
Hey, look, what
about Shaman Touchy Feely?

26:08.227 --> 26:09.761
Uh, oh, get this.

26:09.795 --> 26:11.830
Shaman Little River

26:11.864 --> 26:13.632
is actually named
Jeremy Brewster.

26:13.666 --> 26:14.900
He changed his name
ten years ago.

26:14.934 --> 26:16.468
Good work, Sweets.

26:16.502 --> 26:18.182
Don't patronize me.
I'm relaying a message.

26:18.204 --> 26:20.105
There's no psychological
insight involved here.

26:20.139 --> 26:22.474
Sweets, relax.
I'm just record-keeping.

26:22.508 --> 26:24.809
Okay, why'd he change his name?
Maybe he was unhappy

26:24.844 --> 26:27.412
with the non-integration
of his childhood personae.

26:27.446 --> 26:28.513
Sweets!

26:28.547 --> 26:29.981
Just check his file.

26:30.016 --> 26:31.850
There's got to be a reason.
Okay, well...

26:31.884 --> 26:32.817
He had priors.

26:32.852 --> 26:34.819
DUIs, assault, money fraud.

26:34.854 --> 26:36.054
Thank you. Assault.

26:36.088 --> 26:38.323
All right? He has a temper.

26:40.927 --> 26:43.728
Listen, you're just freaking out
because Pelant hacked

26:43.763 --> 26:45.764
into all your research
on all of us

26:45.798 --> 26:47.766
and then used it against us.

26:47.800 --> 26:48.733
You feel guilty.

26:48.768 --> 26:50.735
Thank you, Dr. Montenegro.

26:50.770 --> 26:53.004
Where'd you get your degree
in psychology again?

26:53.039 --> 26:55.707
The same place you got
that degree in sarcasm.

26:55.741 --> 26:58.076
Listen, we all
feel responsible.

26:58.110 --> 27:00.412
But we're not running away.

27:00.446 --> 27:01.813
I'm not running away, okay?

27:01.847 --> 27:03.248
I'm trying to get back
to the real world.

27:03.282 --> 27:04.516
Start helping people.

27:04.550 --> 27:05.917
Be a psychologist again.

27:05.952 --> 27:08.586
Get my hands dirty.

27:10.990 --> 27:14.859
This is an exercise
of trust and communication.

27:14.894 --> 27:17.595
One of each couple will don
this protective suit,

27:17.630 --> 27:20.332
which includes the blindfold.

27:20.366 --> 27:23.735
The other will talk
his or her spouse

27:23.769 --> 27:24.970
through the course.

27:25.004 --> 27:26.271
But first,

27:26.305 --> 27:28.106
choose who's gonna do what.

27:28.708 --> 27:30.241
Suit 'em.

27:31.944 --> 27:33.378
Right... over here.
One suit over here for him.

27:33.412 --> 27:34.980
No, I'll-I'll wear that one.
Right here.

27:35.014 --> 27:37.282
Ease up. Step over that log.
That's it, honey.

27:37.316 --> 27:38.917
Right over there... oh!

27:46.559 --> 27:48.059

Yay, Tony!

28:38.044 --> 28:39.644
They're swinging poles.

28:39.678 --> 28:41.146
Okay? On my count.

28:42.381 --> 28:44.416

Oh, my God!

28:50.856 --> 28:53.058
Tony, are you okay?

28:53.092 --> 28:55.260
I said, you know,
with a slight hesitation,

28:55.294 --> 28:56.227
not the full body blow.

28:56.262 --> 28:58.430
Booth, the victim was hit

28:58.464 --> 29:00.899
from both directions
at the same time.

29:00.933 --> 29:02.333
I think this could be
the murder scene.

29:02.368 --> 29:05.336
Great. A little help here,
Roxie, huh?

29:05.371 --> 29:07.005
Get me up!

29:07.039 --> 29:08.673
Come on, this is...
I got it.

29:08.707 --> 29:09.908
Geez, just roll it over.

29:09.942 --> 29:11.042
I'm trying, Tony.

29:11.077 --> 29:13.311
Just roll it over
like a manicotti.

29:13.345 --> 29:16.481
Feel the stuffed shell, baby.

29:16.515 --> 29:17.882
That's it.

29:21.749 --> 29:23.016
FBI?

29:23.050 --> 29:24.384
That's right.
Mm-hmm, FBI.

29:24.418 --> 29:26.920
And I am also a very
well-respected

29:26.954 --> 29:29.089
forensic anthropologist

29:29.123 --> 29:30.490
who convinced you I was Roxie

29:30.525 --> 29:32.893
because of my superb
acting skills.

29:32.927 --> 29:34.027
That's enough, Bones.

29:34.061 --> 29:35.195
You have no jurisdiction here.

29:35.229 --> 29:36.530
Oh-ho!

29:36.564 --> 29:38.532
Okay, was that
your big plan, huh, pal?

29:38.566 --> 29:41.535
Huh? Kill anyone you want
because we have no jurisdiction?

29:41.569 --> 29:43.136
Kill?
What are you talking about?

29:43.171 --> 29:45.071
Adam Pak was killed here.

29:45.840 --> 29:47.741
I didn't do it.

29:47.775 --> 29:49.476
I'm a healer, not a killer.

29:49.510 --> 29:50.944
A healer?
You're Jeremy Brewster.

29:50.978 --> 29:52.712
And you have a record.

29:52.747 --> 29:55.882
Okay, I'm sort of a fraud.

29:55.917 --> 29:57.450
But I've read all
the self-help books.

29:57.485 --> 29:59.319
I give them
what they need.

29:59.353 --> 30:02.289
My clients, they get
their money's worth.

30:02.323 --> 30:04.024
Well, maybe Adam found out
who you really were.

30:04.058 --> 30:05.792
That gives you great motive
to keep him quiet.

30:05.826 --> 30:07.794
The evidence suggests

30:07.828 --> 30:09.763
he was killed
on your obstacle course.

30:09.797 --> 30:11.064
You know, I don't have
to talk to you.

30:11.098 --> 30:12.378
No, you don't have
to say a word.

30:12.400 --> 30:14.367
As long as you don't
leave this land.

30:14.402 --> 30:15.936
But the second
you step off,

30:15.970 --> 30:18.104
you're all ours.

30:18.973 --> 30:21.241
Okay, okay.

30:21.275 --> 30:23.043
Adam and Kelly,

30:23.077 --> 30:24.811
they were both insane.

30:24.845 --> 30:27.147
He confessed to me
that he was married.

30:27.181 --> 30:28.782
Made me promise
not to tell anyone.

30:28.816 --> 30:31.718
Then Kelly started coming on
to me to make Adam jealous.

30:31.752 --> 30:34.287
They need real help.

30:34.322 --> 30:35.722
I could only imagine

30:35.756 --> 30:38.692
what would happen
if his wife found out.

30:38.726 --> 30:41.127
We're gonna keep
an eye on you, Jeremy.

30:43.097 --> 30:45.665
Please don't tell
them about me.

30:45.700 --> 30:48.301
I've got a good business
going here-- honest.

30:48.336 --> 30:49.936
It's stuck, Booth.

30:49.971 --> 30:51.371
All right, you got to get
me out of this.

30:51.405 --> 30:53.840
I'm a ball of
sweat in here.

30:57.778 --> 31:00.347
Oh, you didn't have
to do this, Arastoo.

31:00.381 --> 31:01.915
It's nothing-- I stole it.

31:01.949 --> 31:04.451
That way if you go to prison,
we can share a cell.

31:05.686 --> 31:07.654
Hodgins' lawyer said
I have to hire

31:07.688 --> 31:08.989
a forensic accountant to dig

31:09.023 --> 31:10.657
through all
the fraudulent records.

31:10.691 --> 31:12.192
This could take months.

31:12.226 --> 31:13.460
My salary's gonna have to go

31:13.494 --> 31:14.928
into an escrow account.

31:14.962 --> 31:16.930
What happened to "innocent
until proven guilty"?

31:16.964 --> 31:19.132
I feel like I'm back in Iran.

31:19.166 --> 31:20.934
Hey.

31:20.968 --> 31:24.204
So, based on the data and the
photos from Brennan and Booth,

31:24.238 --> 31:27.807
there is no way that the
gauntlet is the murder weapon.

31:27.842 --> 31:29.709
There isn't enough speed
behind the pendulum swing

31:29.744 --> 31:32.746
and the fracture
patterns don't match.

31:32.780 --> 31:35.215
Of course, why did
I expect good news?

31:35.249 --> 31:36.716
Good news!

31:36.751 --> 31:38.485
Okay, don't play
with me, Dr. Hodgins.

31:38.519 --> 31:39.719
The results on the wood splinter

31:39.754 --> 31:41.454
from the victim's teeth are in.

31:41.489 --> 31:43.423
It's oak.

31:43.457 --> 31:45.158
Same splinters they found
on his clothes.

31:45.192 --> 31:47.274
Yes, but there are traces of sap
still present in these.

31:47.275 --> 31:48.098
Is that important?

31:48.123 --> 31:50.163
Well, it means that the
sliver's from a living tree.

31:50.231 --> 31:51.598
Now, check this out.

31:51.632 --> 31:53.066
These are oak trees

31:53.100 --> 31:54.901
in the southeast corner
of the reservation.

31:54.935 --> 31:58.305
Right at the edge of the
New Dawn Retreat property.

31:58.339 --> 31:59.439
Yeah, now
that whitish gray substance

31:59.473 --> 32:02.008
on the overgrown grass,

32:02.043 --> 32:03.410
that is agricultural lime.

32:03.444 --> 32:06.212
Adam Pak died in this
part of the reservation.

32:08.549 --> 32:10.450
This is the murder scene.

32:10.484 --> 32:12.452
This tree has sustained

32:12.486 --> 32:14.354
significant damage to its bark.

32:14.388 --> 32:16.456
Look, Booth, these are teeth.

32:16.490 --> 32:18.958
This is the murder weapon.
Oh, ho, ho, ho, wait a second here.

32:18.993 --> 32:20.660
Look at this, huh?

32:20.695 --> 32:23.129
Keys, yeah, these
could be the victim's

32:23.164 --> 32:24.764
or the killer's.

32:24.799 --> 32:27.667
Even with skeletal fluorosis,
Adam's injuries are

32:27.702 --> 32:30.503
not consistent
with just running into a tree.

32:30.538 --> 32:33.406
Something propelled him
into the tree with great force.

32:33.441 --> 32:34.708
Yeah, like a car?

32:34.742 --> 32:35.842
I mean, come on,
look at these.

32:35.876 --> 32:37.377
Huh? Is it a coincidence

32:37.411 --> 32:40.714
that these tire tracks go
right up to the murder tree?

32:40.748 --> 32:42.248
Oh, look at this, huh?

32:42.283 --> 32:44.351
Driveway gravel.

32:44.385 --> 32:46.019
You seem awfully sure.
Yeah, and it's red, too, okay?

32:46.053 --> 32:48.288
It's the same
red driveway gravel

32:48.322 --> 32:50.724
that I saw
at Emma Pak's house.

32:51.892 --> 32:54.027
I'm bringing her in.

32:56.864 --> 32:59.899
The tree is a match
and so are the teeth.

32:59.934 --> 33:01.368
Yeah, I heard.

33:01.402 --> 33:02.969
Are you okay?

33:03.003 --> 33:04.871
I just got another letter

33:04.905 --> 33:06.606
from a collection agency.

33:06.640 --> 33:09.442
This one says I owe $36,000.

33:09.477 --> 33:11.878
Whoever's using my name
has spent hundreds

33:11.912 --> 33:13.246
of thousands of dollars.

33:13.280 --> 33:14.714
You knew there'd be more.

33:16.350 --> 33:18.885
Cam...
She's ruined my good name.

33:28.329 --> 33:30.230
No, not... not here.

33:30.264 --> 33:32.031
Let's make an exception.

33:36.637 --> 33:38.571
I grew up in the South Bronx.

33:38.606 --> 33:41.107
I've been working
since I was 11 years old.

33:41.142 --> 33:42.375
I know.

33:42.410 --> 33:43.877
Valedictorian in my high school,

33:43.911 --> 33:45.912
full academic scholarship
through med school,

33:45.946 --> 33:49.282
I interned at two of the best
hospitals in the country.

33:49.316 --> 33:50.683
I know your story.

33:50.718 --> 33:52.919
I was the youngest coroner
in New York City.

33:52.953 --> 33:54.187
And now...

33:54.221 --> 33:55.622
You're here.

33:55.656 --> 33:58.291
Running the most respected
lab in the country.

33:58.325 --> 33:59.559
And somebody has stolen
that from me.

33:59.593 --> 34:01.161
No.
Yes!

34:01.195 --> 34:02.362
Stolen everything

34:02.396 --> 34:03.830
I have worked
my whole life for.

34:03.864 --> 34:05.999
Not even close.
I am this far away

34:06.033 --> 34:07.133
from debtor's prison.

34:07.168 --> 34:08.201
They don't have that anymore.

34:08.235 --> 34:10.069
I might lose my house.

34:10.103 --> 34:12.705
All of that is true...

34:12.739 --> 34:15.007
but none of it is really you.

34:15.042 --> 34:18.110
You're just saying that
because you love me.

34:18.145 --> 34:20.380
I do.

34:32.659 --> 34:34.561
I don't know what else
you want me to say.

34:34.594 --> 34:37.297
Look, I-I didn't know
he was cheating on me, I swear.

34:37.331 --> 34:38.630
We got a dead body, okay?

34:38.666 --> 34:40.132
And your driveway gravel

34:40.167 --> 34:41.801
puts you at the scene
of the crime.

34:41.835 --> 34:43.770
That's impossible.
I never left my house.

34:43.804 --> 34:45.839
Look, ask the security company.
My guess is

34:45.873 --> 34:48.174
you called security to give yourself
an alibi that night.

34:48.208 --> 34:50.310
- Who thinks like that?
- Murderers.

34:50.344 --> 34:52.344
That's who thinks like that.
Murderers.

35:00.172 --> 35:01.338
You didn't learn anything

35:01.373 --> 35:02.973
about your relationship
with Booth?

35:03.008 --> 35:04.708
I wasn't there
with Booth.

35:04.743 --> 35:06.377
Roxie was there with Tony.

35:06.411 --> 35:07.778
Okay.

35:07.813 --> 35:09.013
Did Roxie
learn anything

35:09.047 --> 35:10.714
about her relationship
with Tony?

35:10.749 --> 35:13.083
Shaman Little River
is a fraud, Angela.

35:13.118 --> 35:14.618
He has no wisdom
to impart.

35:14.653 --> 35:17.354
You, a trained
anthropologist,

35:17.389 --> 35:19.723
immersed yourself
in a specific culture

35:19.758 --> 35:21.225
and you
learned nothing?

35:22.394 --> 35:24.161
I did realize that,

35:24.196 --> 35:25.663
compared to others,

35:25.697 --> 35:28.599
Booth and I have
a very good relationship.

35:28.633 --> 35:30.434
So you learned nothing.

35:30.468 --> 35:32.036
There's something
embedded...

35:32.070 --> 35:33.237
What is that?

35:33.271 --> 35:34.805
Inorganic.

35:34.840 --> 35:37.141
Given the location,
it could be from the car

35:37.175 --> 35:38.843
that hit Adam Pak
from behind

35:38.877 --> 35:41.712
and propelled him
into the tree.

35:41.746 --> 35:43.414
You manipulated me into
answering that question

35:43.448 --> 35:45.082
by exploiting
my professional ego.

35:45.116 --> 35:47.418
God, the old Brennan
never would've seen that.

35:50.222 --> 35:52.656
Oh, gotta run.

35:54.526 --> 35:56.527
Okay, here you go.

35:56.561 --> 35:57.628
Oh.

35:57.662 --> 36:00.030
Uh, digital
and hard copies.

36:00.065 --> 36:02.633
What's this?
Well, I figure

36:02.667 --> 36:05.402
why pay a forensic accountant
when you've got me?

36:06.972 --> 36:08.505
I don't believe it.

36:08.540 --> 36:11.041
And I don't
bill by the hour,

36:11.076 --> 36:12.610
so I won't
waste your time.

36:12.644 --> 36:14.678
Wh... Angela, you're too busy.

36:14.713 --> 36:15.913
I didn't want you to do this.

36:15.947 --> 36:17.181
Yeah, I know.

36:17.215 --> 36:18.616
Because you're insane.

36:18.650 --> 36:20.684
You've got friends here, Cam.

36:20.719 --> 36:21.685
People who love you.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.187
Arastoo...

36:23.221 --> 36:25.556
It's not a burden
for any of us to help you.

36:25.590 --> 36:27.191
It's time you start
accepting that.

36:27.225 --> 36:29.159
I just didn't
want people to...

36:29.194 --> 36:32.963
Yeah, we don't need
to hear the reasons.

36:32.998 --> 36:34.331
Okay, so...

36:34.366 --> 36:36.500
these are all the
fraudulent accounts

36:36.534 --> 36:38.535
that have been opened
or used in your name

36:38.570 --> 36:40.237
within the last 90 days.

36:40.272 --> 36:43.540
I mean, it's just a start,
but it's something.

36:43.575 --> 36:45.876
How did you...?
Well...

36:45.911 --> 36:48.379
I looked in a few places
I wasn't supposed to be looking.

36:48.413 --> 36:49.914
I won't get
into the details.

36:49.948 --> 36:51.849
I just thought,

36:51.883 --> 36:54.084
since you were
the good guy...

36:57.088 --> 36:58.856
Oh, don't cry.

36:58.890 --> 37:00.557
No, I won't.

37:05.096 --> 37:07.798
Wow.

37:07.832 --> 37:09.266
Thank you.

37:18.343 --> 37:21.011
The particulate you found
was a chrome alloy.

37:21.046 --> 37:22.579
From a car?

37:22.614 --> 37:24.114
I can be even
more specific.

37:24.149 --> 37:25.516
You see, over
the last 50 years, right,

37:25.550 --> 37:26.917
the auto industry
has changed

37:26.952 --> 37:29.453
the chrome alloy composition
it uses on cars.

37:29.487 --> 37:30.988
The composition of the
particulate from the victim

37:31.022 --> 37:32.623
proves that the car
that hit Adam Pak

37:32.657 --> 37:34.758
was manufactured
prior to the 1970s.

37:34.793 --> 37:36.927
So, a vintage car.
Give me some time,

37:36.962 --> 37:38.395
I can track down the make.

37:38.430 --> 37:39.663
You can have
all the time you want,

37:39.698 --> 37:41.298
but I think I might know.

37:41.333 --> 37:42.900
<i>The Schumachers drive</i>
<i>a 1965 van.</i>

37:42.934 --> 37:44.401
The Schumachers?

37:44.436 --> 37:45.864
I did not see that coming.
Should've known.

37:45.889 --> 37:46.437
Why?

37:46.438 --> 37:48.138
Why? Because they're
like the world's greatest couple.

37:48.173 --> 37:49.807
I mean, what were they doing
at that couples' retreat?

37:49.841 --> 37:51.275
I'm the shrink!
I should have thought of that.

37:51.309 --> 37:53.277
Okay, what did
you find out?

37:54.579 --> 37:55.946
Well, the Schumachers

37:55.981 --> 37:57.181
went to four different
couples' retreats

37:57.215 --> 37:58.449
where one of
the other guests said

37:58.483 --> 37:59.763
that their place
was broken into.

37:59.784 --> 38:01.418
See?
That's good information.

38:01.453 --> 38:02.653
Come on, it's not
psychological insight.

38:02.687 --> 38:04.922
It's just...
checking records.

38:04.956 --> 38:06.623
It's not my job.
Look, the Schumachers...

38:06.624 --> 38:08.325
you know what?
They know their victims, okay?

38:08.326 --> 38:10.194
They steal their keys
and they break into their houses.

38:10.228 --> 38:11.595
So it was the Schumachers

38:11.629 --> 38:13.430
that Emma Pak heard
at the house that night.

38:13.465 --> 38:15.632
They got the key, they showed up at
the house to rob it

38:15.667 --> 38:17.835
'cause they thought
Kelly was the wife, right?

38:17.869 --> 38:18.802
Boom!

38:18.837 --> 38:19.970
Booth.

38:21.373 --> 38:22.539
I left a letter on your desk.

38:22.574 --> 38:23.841
No, no.

38:23.875 --> 38:25.376
I have some leave
I haven't taken.

38:25.410 --> 38:26.744
What do you mean, leave?

38:26.778 --> 38:28.245
It'll be like a vacation.

38:28.279 --> 38:29.546
I...

38:29.581 --> 38:30.848
some time.

38:30.882 --> 38:32.282
Just to clear my head.

38:32.317 --> 38:33.884
No, I don't like this.

38:33.918 --> 38:36.020
I need time.

38:38.223 --> 38:40.090
Okay. Time.

38:42.027 --> 38:43.427
Thank you.
Yeah.

38:52.303 --> 38:54.104
We found blood
in the back of your van.

38:54.105 --> 38:56.306
Well, yeah, that's from his head,
where Evelyn smacked him.

38:56.341 --> 38:57.841
Yeah, after
he attacked Bill.

38:57.876 --> 39:00.177
Yeah, after
he had slapped Evelyn

39:00.211 --> 39:02.746
when he caught her returning
his house key to the tent.

39:02.781 --> 39:04.581
And Bill karate-chopped him
in the throat.

39:04.616 --> 39:06.183
Yeah.

39:06.217 --> 39:09.253
Right... What...
what did you smack him with?

39:17.429 --> 39:18.896
Okay, you carry this
around with you?

39:18.930 --> 39:20.697
An old lady alone
in the world?

39:20.732 --> 39:21.999
I call that
my equalizer.

39:22.033 --> 39:23.333
Mm-hmm.

39:23.368 --> 39:25.803
You know, we thought
Pak was dead.

39:25.837 --> 39:27.204
Bundled him into the van

39:27.238 --> 39:28.772
and looked to dump
him somewhere.

39:28.807 --> 39:29.973
Yeah, but he woke up

39:30.008 --> 39:31.508
and tried to make
a run for it.

39:31.543 --> 39:33.577
So you ran him over.

39:33.611 --> 39:34.878
God, this...

39:34.913 --> 39:36.680
this guy knows everything,
doesn't he?

39:36.714 --> 39:38.816
Your mother must
be so proud.

39:38.850 --> 39:39.950
Okay, a little word of advice:

39:39.984 --> 39:41.618
When you go to
the courts, you know,

39:41.653 --> 39:42.920
try to look...
sorry, you know?

39:42.954 --> 39:44.188
It helps.

39:44.222 --> 39:46.690
Well, that's gonna be hard.

39:46.724 --> 39:49.827
I mean, the man
brought his mistress

39:49.861 --> 39:51.528
to a married
couples' retreat.

39:51.563 --> 39:53.497
No one's gonna
cry for him.

39:53.531 --> 39:55.132
Marriage means something.

39:55.166 --> 39:56.733
Now...

39:56.768 --> 39:58.702
are you really married
to that sweetheart

39:58.736 --> 40:00.537
you brought to the retreat, huh?

40:00.572 --> 40:02.005
Okay, what if I say "no"?
You gonna hit me

40:02.040 --> 40:03.240
over the head and run me over?

40:03.241 --> 40:04.842
No.

40:04.876 --> 40:06.343
It's obvious you love her.

40:06.377 --> 40:08.545
Yeah, the way
she looked at you...

40:08.580 --> 40:10.114
you can't fake that.
No, no.

40:10.148 --> 40:12.316
- Marry her, big boy.
- Oh, come on, look...

40:12.350 --> 40:13.684
I am not gonna take some advice

40:13.718 --> 40:16.086
from a couple of
house-robbing murderers.

40:16.121 --> 40:17.588
Then take advice
from a couple

40:17.622 --> 40:19.957
who've loved each other
for 38 years.

40:19.991 --> 40:21.792
Oh, hey...

40:21.826 --> 40:23.293
we're gonna be able

40:23.328 --> 40:25.295
to bunk together
in prison, right?

40:25.330 --> 40:27.798
Oh, of course, pet.

40:27.832 --> 40:29.633
They can't break us up.

40:29.667 --> 40:31.869
You know that.

40:34.806 --> 40:36.039
You didn't tell
the Schumachers

40:36.074 --> 40:38.775
that they'd be
separated in prison?

40:38.810 --> 40:40.544
Well, you know,
I didn't have the heart

40:40.578 --> 40:42.546
to do that, I just...

40:42.580 --> 40:43.847
All right, Bones,

40:43.882 --> 40:45.415
why are we doing this?
The guy was a fraud.

40:45.450 --> 40:47.117
Although I don't believe
in the shaman's

40:47.152 --> 40:49.887
"fluctuating fields
of force" exercise,

40:49.921 --> 40:52.890
I do believe in biological

40:52.924 --> 40:54.758
electrical impulses.
Okay, come on,

40:54.792 --> 40:56.660
let's hurry up, let's get this done,
I got a game to watch.

40:56.694 --> 40:57.694
Booth...
What?

40:57.729 --> 40:58.962
Come on.
All right.

40:58.997 --> 41:01.999
Only our palms touch,
nothing else.

41:02.033 --> 41:04.401
Just let your mind drift.

41:05.904 --> 41:08.172
Sweets is, um, taking
a leave of absence.

41:08.206 --> 41:09.706
To do what?

41:09.741 --> 41:10.908
Well, he said that he, uh,

41:10.942 --> 41:12.242
lost touch with his
original motivation

41:12.277 --> 41:13.544
for being a psychologist.

41:13.578 --> 41:15.018
Well, I thought
he was a psychologist

41:15.046 --> 41:17.014
because he had
substandard math skills.

41:17.048 --> 41:18.182
Okay, are we done
here or...?

41:18.216 --> 41:19.750
No! No.
Booth, come on.

41:19.784 --> 41:21.418
All right.
I'm right here.

41:21.452 --> 41:22.553
I'm right here.

41:26.558 --> 41:29.526
Did Bill and Evelyn
remind you of us?

41:30.728 --> 41:32.696
Um... well, if somebody
was choking me,

41:32.730 --> 41:34.865
would you hit them over the head
with a billiard ball?

41:34.899 --> 41:36.900
Yes.

41:36.935 --> 41:38.335
If someone slapped me,

41:38.369 --> 41:40.204
would you karate chop
them in the throat?

41:40.238 --> 41:42.172
Yeah, I would.

41:45.710 --> 41:46.610
Mmm...

41:46.644 --> 41:47.945
Booth!
Mm-hmm?

41:47.979 --> 41:49.479
Booth, we are only
supposed to touch

41:49.514 --> 41:51.748
the palms of our hands....
Oh...

41:51.783 --> 41:53.050
I can't help it. I...
...nothing else.

41:53.084 --> 41:54.718
I'm just drifting.

41:54.752 --> 41:56.687
I'm drifting
with the whole...

41:56.721 --> 41:58.922
electronical
device thing.

41:58.957 --> 42:00.591
Electrical impulses.
