Well, he took one to the chest.

10:32.225 --> 10:33.958
The paramedics took him
over to King.

10:33.960 --> 10:36.327

he took one to the head.

10:39.165 --> 10:41.966

10:55.215 --> 10:57.382

over and takes the car.

11:18.872 --> 11:20.538
GROVER: Looks like there's
someone in the trunk.

11:20.540 --> 11:22.507
OFFICER: You're all right,
sir, okay? It's gonna be okay.

11:22.509 --> 11:23.708
(grunting)

11:35.654 --> 11:37.522
Well, you're certainly
in the ballpark

11:37.524 --> 11:39.057
with your passenger theory.

11:39.059 --> 11:41.225
Lou, roll it back.
See if we can pull a frame

11:41.227 --> 11:43.461
where the killer's actually
facing the camera.

11:45.497 --> 11:47.632
No. No good.

11:47.634 --> 11:49.200
Image is too blurry
for facial rec.

11:49.202 --> 11:50.702
All right,
so a patrolman

11:50.704 --> 11:52.537
pulls over a guy
for a broken taillight,

11:52.539 --> 11:54.606
ends up interrupting
a kidnapping.

11:54.608 --> 11:57.575
Not exactly your average
traffic stop, is it?

11:57.577 --> 11:59.377
It's not exactly your average
kidnapping, either.

11:59.379 --> 12:01.446
Why do you say that?
How many kidnapping victims

12:01.448 --> 12:04.182
you know shoot the person
who's trying to help them?

12:06.251 --> 12:07.819
(groans)

12:26.396 --> 12:27.797
KONO: ...over to me once
the evidence is processed.

12:27.799 --> 12:29.832
Okay? Hey.

12:29.835 --> 12:31.525
(sighs)
Hey.

12:31.526 --> 12:33.960
Everything all right?
Yeah, everything's great.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.728
What do we know?

12:35.730 --> 12:37.730
HFD got the call
after 6:00 a.m.

12:37.732 --> 12:39.132
Car was still burning
when they got here.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.567
All right, we definite
it's the same car?

12:41.569 --> 12:44.237
Yeah, license plates match.

12:44.239 --> 12:45.705
CSU found this in the car.

12:45.707 --> 12:48.675
Gas can and rubber hose.
Yeah, I'm thinking

12:48.677 --> 12:50.043
our killer used 'em

12:50.045 --> 12:52.178
to siphon the fuel
out of the gas tank.

12:52.180 --> 12:53.313
It's a smart plan.

12:53.315 --> 12:55.181
He torches the car
and there goes any chance

12:55.183 --> 12:58.084
we have of recovering
any prints or DNA.

12:58.086 --> 12:59.852
HPD canvass the area?

12:59.854 --> 13:01.721
Yeah, no witnesses so far.

13:01.723 --> 13:04.324
Yeah, no cameras, either--

13:04.326 --> 13:06.059
traffic, ATM or private.

13:06.061 --> 13:07.994
This area's just
one giant blind spot.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.228
Well, I think
it's safe to assume

13:09.230 --> 13:10.763
he didn't chose
this location at random.

13:10.765 --> 13:12.265
Obviously, we're
dealing with someone

13:12.267 --> 13:14.200
who knows how to
cover their tracks.

13:14.202 --> 13:16.002
Which means I.D.'ing
this guy won't be easy.

13:16.004 --> 13:17.204
Well, hopefully
Danny and Steve

13:17.205 --> 13:18.271
are having better luck
with the driver.

13:18.273 --> 13:19.972
MAX:
<i>Gentleman, you are in luck.</i>

13:19.974 --> 13:22.608
I ran your John Doe's
prints through AFIS

13:22.610 --> 13:24.077
and found a hit.

13:24.079 --> 13:27.113
Meet Greg Farmer.
He is a bail enforcement agent

13:27.115 --> 13:28.748
licensed
out of Nevada.

13:28.750 --> 13:30.116
He was a bounty hunter.

13:30.118 --> 13:32.652
So the guy in the trunk
must have been a skip.

13:32.654 --> 13:34.120
Well, if that's the case,
we need to find

13:34.122 --> 13:35.888
the bail bondsman
Farmer was working for,

13:35.890 --> 13:37.757
see if we can figure out
who he came here to grab.

13:37.759 --> 13:38.891
Well, that's not
gonna be very easy.

13:38.893 --> 13:40.593
Most bounty hunters
work freelance.

13:40.595 --> 13:42.128
They're not, uh,
exclusive to one

13:42.130 --> 13:43.496
bail bondsman.

13:43.498 --> 13:45.898
Well, Max, you got something
to contribute here, or...

13:45.900 --> 13:48.468
Well, the bounty hunter
Boba Fett worked for both

13:48.470 --> 13:50.603
Jabba the Hutt and
Darth Vader, so I understand

13:50.605 --> 13:53.606
the point that Detective
Williams was trying to make.

13:53.608 --> 13:55.341
Right.

13:55.343 --> 13:58.444
Moving on.
Uh, any other findings?

13:58.446 --> 14:01.080
Yes. I found traces
of fresh asphalt

14:01.082 --> 14:03.316
on the soles
of the victim's shoes.

14:03.318 --> 14:06.018
And it might
be interesting to note

14:06.020 --> 14:09.555
that CSU found traces
of similar asphalt mixture

14:09.557 --> 14:11.591
in the trunk of the car
that was recovered.

14:11.593 --> 14:13.960
Most likely a transfer
from the killer's shoes.

14:13.962 --> 14:15.828
So this guy and the guy
from the trunk

14:15.830 --> 14:17.563
both stepped on
fresh pavement somewhere.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.532
Yeah, well, if we could figure
out which street it was,

14:19.534 --> 14:21.968
maybe it could lead to
our shooter's I.D.

14:21.970 --> 14:23.136
GROVER: <i>So I checked in</i>
<i>with the Honolulu</i>

14:23.138 --> 14:24.871
<i>transportation department.</i>

14:24.873 --> 14:27.473
They told me there was only one
resurfacing project

14:27.475 --> 14:30.009
on the entire island last night.

14:30.011 --> 14:31.477
2000 block of Anakole Place.

14:31.479 --> 14:32.712
It's in Pearl City,

14:32.714 --> 14:34.680
it's a residential neighborhood
and the crew

14:34.682 --> 14:36.416
was done about 2:00 a.m.
this morning.

14:36.418 --> 14:38.151
All right, what do we know about
the residents on the street?

14:38.153 --> 14:39.886
I ran background on all of 'em,

14:39.888 --> 14:42.655
and they all
checked out except one guy:

14:42.657 --> 14:43.990
David Sutter.

14:43.992 --> 14:45.825
He moved into a house
about a year ago.

14:45.827 --> 14:47.360
He's the only renter
on the block,

14:47.362 --> 14:49.228
and his landlord said that
when he rented the place,

14:49.230 --> 14:51.664
he paid six months
in advance, in cash.

14:51.666 --> 14:53.533
Well, that does sound
a little suspicious.

14:53.535 --> 14:54.734
That ain't the half of it.

14:54.736 --> 14:57.437
Turns out David Sutter
showed the landlord

14:57.439 --> 15:00.273
a Hawai'i drivers license
when he rented the place,

15:00.275 --> 15:02.442
so I run it through DMV--
no record of him.

15:02.444 --> 15:03.910
And there's also no employment,

15:03.912 --> 15:06.212
tax, or credit history
on the guy.

15:06.214 --> 15:08.981
Fake I.D.'s,
lots of cash, aliases.

15:08.983 --> 15:11.150
Sounds like somebody
on the run to me.

15:11.152 --> 15:12.785
I'm gonna send
his address information

15:12.787 --> 15:14.353
to you on your GPS right now.

15:14.355 --> 15:16.622
All right.
Thanks, Lou.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.627
So, uh, you bringing
a date to the... to the wedding?

15:21.629 --> 15:23.963
No, no... I mean,
I hadn't planned on it.

15:23.965 --> 15:25.198
Yeah.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.300
Well, I mean, you're
just gonna be sitting

15:27.302 --> 15:30.313
at the singles table with, uh,
Kamekona, Jerry and Flippa.

15:30.314 --> 15:31.980
I'll be fine.
Well, you'll be

15:31.981 --> 15:34.081
hungry, is what you're gonna be.
Why don't you bring Ellie?

15:34.083 --> 15:35.883
No, no. Ellie's, uh,
you know, she's my buddy.

15:35.885 --> 15:38.052
I don't want to...
I don't want to ruin that,

15:38.054 --> 15:39.820
ask her to the wedding,
make her believe...

15:39.822 --> 15:41.022
Yeah, yeah, no, I get it.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.891
You know, Melissa has a friend...
No.

15:43.893 --> 15:45.459
I'm... No.
But she's very cute.

15:45.461 --> 15:46.494
No.
What no?

15:46.496 --> 15:47.828
No. No, because no.

15:47.830 --> 15:49.630
Steve, you got to move on
at some point, okay?

15:49.632 --> 15:50.698
It's been a year.
All right,

15:50.700 --> 15:52.333
I was with Catherine
for a long time.

15:52.335 --> 15:54.535
Okay? I'm good...

15:54.537 --> 15:55.870
at the moment. I'm fine.

15:55.872 --> 15:57.605
I'm not ready
to jump into something

15:57.607 --> 16:00.041
with somebody else, that's all.
I appreciate... I appreciate it.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.209
It's a simple question.
Done. Done. All right.

16:02.211 --> 16:03.805
Can Melissa's friend
send a picture? That's all.

16:03.806 --> 16:04.211
(whooshes)

16:04.213 --> 16:05.513
What is... (whooshes)
What is that?

16:05.515 --> 16:06.914
That's a wall of silence.

16:06.916 --> 16:08.482
I just put up a wall of silence.

16:08.484 --> 16:10.151
Oh, is that what that is?
Mm-hmm.

16:10.153 --> 16:11.352
'Cause that's gonna shut me up.

16:11.354 --> 16:12.453
Gonna make you
change the subject.

16:12.455 --> 16:14.055
Nothing can shut you up.

16:14.057 --> 16:15.723
So that's a "no" on the picture?

16:15.725 --> 16:18.025
Send the Pict...
(whooshes)

16:18.760 --> 16:19.960
DANNY:
<i>You know what?</i>

16:19.962 --> 16:22.163
<i>You have the brain</i>
<i>of a five-year-old.</i>

16:41.083 --> 16:44.919
So much as twitch, I empty
your heads on the carpet.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.987
You're not him.

16:46.989 --> 16:48.222
Nope.

16:48.224 --> 16:50.324
But if he ever shows,
I own his ass.

16:50.326 --> 16:51.392
I was here first.

16:51.394 --> 16:53.461
Another bounty hunter.
Hello.

16:53.463 --> 16:55.796
All right, buddy, just take it
easy, we're cops, all right?

16:55.798 --> 16:57.064
(chuckles)
Okay.

16:57.066 --> 16:58.899
And I'm the Dalai Lama.

16:58.901 --> 17:00.801
Now drop the hardware.

17:00.803 --> 17:02.403
Do it slow.

17:02.405 --> 17:03.904
Well, you see,
those two actions,

17:03.906 --> 17:05.071
they don't
really go together.

17:05.074 --> 17:06.540
He's right, you can't...
It's impossible

17:06.541 --> 17:07.742
to drop something slowly.

17:07.743 --> 17:08.909
Okay, how's this:

17:08.911 --> 17:12.512
gently place your
weapons on the floor.

17:12.515 --> 17:13.614
No problem.
That I can do.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.148
Okay.
No-No problem at all.

17:23.425 --> 17:24.692
Come on, man.

17:24.694 --> 17:26.260
Hands behind your back.

17:26.262 --> 17:28.662
Seriously? We're all in
the same fraternity here.

17:28.664 --> 17:31.832
Huh? I told you we're cops.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.507
New York.

17:39.509 --> 17:40.741
You're a long way from home.

17:40.743 --> 17:43.077
Hey, Danny, I want you
to meet Richie Malloy.

17:43.079 --> 17:44.545
Hi, Richie.

17:44.547 --> 17:46.580
Danny.
What do you got?

17:46.582 --> 17:50.084
I got a lot of stuff.
I got a stash piece,

17:50.086 --> 17:52.520
I got a stun gun
and, uh, some mace.

17:52.522 --> 17:53.621
He's like a walking armory.

17:53.623 --> 17:55.556
Yeah, well Pelham's
one dangerous dude.

17:55.558 --> 17:57.491
Pelham?
That's his real name?

17:57.493 --> 17:59.059
Yeah,
Andrew Pelham.

17:59.061 --> 18:01.896
Oh.

18:01.898 --> 18:04.632
You boys are a few steps
behind, aren't you?

18:04.634 --> 18:06.100
Apparently, so why
don't you catch us up?

18:06.102 --> 18:07.234
Who's Pelham?

18:07.236 --> 18:10.037
All right, for starters,
he's one of you.

18:10.906 --> 18:12.606
What do you mean,
"one of us"?

18:12.608 --> 18:13.941
The killer we're
looking for,

18:13.943 --> 18:15.309
he's a cop.

18:26.474 --> 18:27.425
STEVE:
Pelham.

18:27.426 --> 18:28.391
P-E-L-H-A-M?

18:28.393 --> 18:29.926
MALLOY:
H-A-M.

18:31.095 --> 18:32.796
Got him, charged with
three different homicides,

18:32.798 --> 18:34.931
all on Long Island.
Yeah, two years ago.

18:34.933 --> 18:36.933
Vics were all women
in their early 20s.

18:36.935 --> 18:38.068
It says here,

18:38.070 --> 18:39.236
he broke
into their houses,

18:39.238 --> 18:40.537
tortured them
and then killed them.

18:40.539 --> 18:43.139
A real credit
to your profession, huh?

18:43.141 --> 18:45.342
Explain something to me: how
does this guy ever make bail?

18:45.344 --> 18:48.044
'Cause the original case
against him was crap.

18:48.046 --> 18:51.982
The first Vic, she was a college
student, Jennifer Leddy.

18:51.984 --> 18:53.717
Went missing
over Christmas break.

18:53.719 --> 18:54.951
Well, the cops investigated,

18:54.953 --> 18:56.686
and they found Pelham's DNA
in her apartment,

18:56.688 --> 18:58.855
but that was it,
so, all they had him on

18:58.857 --> 19:00.156
was a B and E.

19:00.158 --> 19:02.626
A month after
he makes bail,

19:02.628 --> 19:04.194
they found Leddy's body.

19:04.196 --> 19:05.495
Then they found two more.

19:05.497 --> 19:08.331
Trace evidence on one
linked to Pelham.

19:08.333 --> 19:11.868
So cops had him dead to rights,
he splits town,

19:11.870 --> 19:13.737
been hiding out here
ever since.

19:13.739 --> 19:15.038
Kept out of trouble.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.307
Even got himself a job
as a dog-walker.

19:17.309 --> 19:20.510
That's smart--
low profile, cash business.

19:20.512 --> 19:22.879
All right, how'd you figure out
that Pelham was on Oahu?

19:22.881 --> 19:23.881
Uh...

19:23.882 --> 19:25.482
I didn't.

19:25.484 --> 19:27.517
Another bounty hunter
tracked him down.

19:27.519 --> 19:30.287
But I got a mole inside
this other guy's operation,

19:30.289 --> 19:32.956
and she gyve me the heads up
that her boss was coming out,

19:32.958 --> 19:35.125
gave me all the Intel
they have on Pelham, so...

19:35.127 --> 19:36.860
got my ass on a plane.

19:36.862 --> 19:38.328
Uh, let me ask
you a question,

19:38.330 --> 19:40.430
that, uh, other bounty
hunter's named Greg Farmer?

19:40.432 --> 19:42.299
How'd you know?

19:42.301 --> 19:44.301
Farmer's dead.

19:44.303 --> 19:46.102
What?!

19:46.104 --> 19:47.370
Last night, he grabbed Pelham,

19:47.372 --> 19:48.938
bagged him up, put him
in the truck of a car.

19:48.940 --> 19:52.008
An officer pulled him over
for a broken taillight,

19:52.010 --> 19:54.010
checks his trunk,
Pelham makes his move,

19:54.012 --> 19:57.280
shoots the officer,
executes Farmer.

19:57.282 --> 19:59.215
Wow.

19:59.346 --> 20:01.146
There was no love lost
between Farmer and me,

20:01.148 --> 20:03.182
but I never wanted
the hump to get dead.

20:04.751 --> 20:06.518
Anyway...

20:06.520 --> 20:09.588
given what's happened,
I got no problem backing off,

20:09.590 --> 20:12.925
letting you guys go after Pelham
without me cramping your style.

20:12.927 --> 20:14.393
I appreciate that.

20:14.395 --> 20:16.328
Uh, unless you need my help.

20:16.330 --> 20:18.764
No, I think we're, uh,
I think we got it.

20:18.766 --> 20:19.998
Okay.

20:20.000 --> 20:23.068
You know what,
I-I'm just gonna float this.

20:23.070 --> 20:25.337
Pelham is worth 40 grand.

20:25.339 --> 20:27.372
You let me take him
back to New York,

20:27.374 --> 20:31.443
I kick back a portion
of that to your local...

20:31.445 --> 20:32.945
widows and orphans fund.

20:34.481 --> 20:35.747
No?

20:35.749 --> 20:38.050
All right, well, I guess
it was worth a shot.

20:38.052 --> 20:41.153
Well, seeing as how
I done nothing wrong,

20:41.155 --> 20:42.888
I think I'm free to go.

20:42.890 --> 20:44.857
So if you could just...

20:44.859 --> 20:47.626
uncuff me,

20:47.628 --> 20:50.062
and, uh, hand me Nora,

20:50.064 --> 20:52.264
I'll be on my way.

20:59.305 --> 21:00.606
Happy hunting, gentlemen.

21:00.608 --> 21:02.140
Thank you.

21:11.150 --> 21:12.818
(door closes)

21:12.820 --> 21:14.453
Here.

21:14.455 --> 21:17.089
All right, we got to get CSU
out here to process this place,

21:17.091 --> 21:19.591
see if they can turn up
anything that's gonna help us

21:19.593 --> 21:21.627
figure out what
Pelham's next move is.

21:21.629 --> 21:23.128
Oh, boy.
Is that Rachel?

21:23.130 --> 21:24.130
Yep. "At the park now.

21:24.131 --> 21:25.397
"Really need to see you.

21:25.399 --> 21:26.365
It's important."

21:26.367 --> 21:27.699
I should go.
Go, go.

21:27.701 --> 21:29.301
Thanks.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.948
DANNY:
Hey.

21:45.985 --> 21:46.952
Thanks for coming.

21:46.954 --> 21:48.153
Yeah.

21:48.988 --> 21:49.955
(sighs)

21:49.957 --> 21:52.624
I remember this--
having a panic attack

21:52.626 --> 21:54.726
every time Grace got to
the top of the monkey bars.

21:54.728 --> 21:55.961
(chuckles)

21:57.830 --> 22:00.365
So, what's up?

22:01.768 --> 22:03.769
It's Charlie.

22:03.771 --> 22:05.737
He's sick, Danny.

22:05.739 --> 22:07.272
What do you mean, sick?

22:07.274 --> 22:10.409
He has something called HLH.

22:10.411 --> 22:13.011
It's a disease
that effects his immune system.

22:13.013 --> 22:15.414
It's... it's rare.

22:15.416 --> 22:18.850
Well, how, uh...
how serious is it?

22:18.852 --> 22:20.819
It could kill him.

22:21.955 --> 22:24.089
Rachel...

22:24.091 --> 22:26.525
The good news is,
there is treatment.

22:26.527 --> 22:28.594
His best option is
a bone marrow transplant,

22:28.596 --> 22:30.395
but the problem is
finding a match,

22:30.397 --> 22:32.297
and usually, siblings
are the best ones.

22:32.299 --> 22:36.668
So, what, you want my permission
for Grace, or-or what?

22:36.670 --> 22:39.638
We've tested Grace.
She's not a match.

22:39.640 --> 22:42.441
But every parent

22:42.443 --> 22:45.177
is called a half-match.
Mm-hmm.

22:46.746 --> 22:48.180
It's not their first choice,

22:48.182 --> 22:51.116
but doctors can use
that bone marrow.

22:53.386 --> 22:55.120
The point is,
one parent is usually

22:55.122 --> 22:57.856
a better half-match
than the other.

22:57.858 --> 23:01.627
Why are you telling me this?

23:10.203 --> 23:12.404
That's my kid?

23:18.177 --> 23:20.912
How long have you
known this, Rachel?

23:20.914 --> 23:22.814
(inhales deeply)

23:22.816 --> 23:25.584
You've always known.
Danny, I...

23:25.586 --> 23:27.163
Why would keep something
like this from me?

23:27.187 --> 23:28.688
Because...

23:28.689 --> 23:30.822
your life and the chances

23:30.824 --> 23:33.191
that you take.
The chances I take?

23:33.193 --> 23:35.127
See, if anything
ever happened to you,

23:35.129 --> 23:37.896
I didn't want two kids
growing up without a father.

23:37.898 --> 23:39.865
You had no right to do that.

23:39.867 --> 23:41.700
You understand that?

23:41.702 --> 23:45.170
You had no right to keep that
from me, that I got a son.

23:45.172 --> 23:47.272
(sniffles)

23:51.944 --> 23:55.580
I know that you hate me right
now, and I don't blame you

23:55.582 --> 24:00.018
for hating me,
but I am telling you now.

24:00.020 --> 24:02.387
We have a son, and there
is something wrong with him,

24:02.389 --> 24:04.656
something that
could kill him.

24:07.293 --> 24:09.561
He needs our help.

24:09.563 --> 24:13.198
Okay. Okay, so what...?

24:13.200 --> 24:14.833
So, what happens now?

24:14.835 --> 24:16.234
You need to take a blood test.

24:16.236 --> 24:17.769
It won't take long,
a few minutes.

24:17.771 --> 24:20.539
24 hours to get the result,
and then the doctors can decide

24:20.541 --> 24:21.907
how to proceed
from there.

24:21.909 --> 24:25.110
And then, they set everything up then?
Yes.

24:25.945 --> 24:27.913
(sniffles)

24:27.915 --> 24:29.614
What about Stan? (sniffles)

24:29.616 --> 24:31.249
What does he know?

24:31.251 --> 24:34.319
He knows now.

24:37.490 --> 24:39.157
Mommy,

24:39.159 --> 24:40.425
I'm hungry.

24:40.427 --> 24:41.526
Well, okay, sweetheart.

24:41.528 --> 24:42.861
We'll get you something to eat.

24:42.863 --> 24:44.129
(sniffles)
Oh, Charlie,

24:44.131 --> 24:45.831
you remember, um...

24:45.833 --> 24:47.032
You remember me, buddy.

24:47.034 --> 24:48.133
I'm, uh, Grace's...
Grace's dad.

24:48.135 --> 24:49.167
Yeah, that's right.

24:49.169 --> 24:50.135
Danno.

24:50.137 --> 24:51.803
Oh, he doesn't like
being called...

24:51.805 --> 24:53.238
No, no, no, no,
you can call me Danno

24:53.240 --> 24:54.539
whenever you want.
It's okay.

24:54.541 --> 24:56.408
What, did your sister
teach you that?

24:56.410 --> 24:57.843
Un-huh.
Yeah?

24:57.845 --> 25:00.846
That's good. It's good
to see you again, huh?

25:00.848 --> 25:03.348
All right.

25:03.350 --> 25:05.617
All right.

25:05.619 --> 25:08.320
(children chatting)

25:18.030 --> 25:21.767
My name is Malcolm Leddy.

25:21.769 --> 25:24.136
Three months ago,
my only daughter Jennifer,

25:24.138 --> 25:26.905
was the victim
of a heinous crime.

25:26.907 --> 25:32.110
This unspeakable act was
committed by one individual.

25:32.112 --> 25:33.979
Andrew Pelham.

25:33.981 --> 25:36.715
Jenny was a kind
and decent girl.

25:36.717 --> 25:41.153
After her mom passed away,
it was just the two of us.

25:41.155 --> 25:43.855
When she was looking
at colleges, Jenny would only

25:43.857 --> 25:45.490
consider schools
that were close to home.

25:45.492 --> 25:48.026
She said she didn't want
to move too far away because

25:48.028 --> 25:52.731
she was afraid that her dad
would get... lonely.

25:52.733 --> 25:55.634
Andrew Pelham went on the run
six weeks ago.

25:55.636 --> 26:00.806
If anyone has any information
regarding his whereabouts,

26:00.808 --> 26:02.908
please come forward.

26:02.910 --> 26:06.244
Make him see
the inside of a courtroom.

26:06.246 --> 26:10.315
Let... justice be done.

26:10.317 --> 26:13.485
That's the father
of the first victim.

26:13.487 --> 26:15.153
So, should we reach out?

26:15.155 --> 26:17.455
Let him know that Pelham's
been spotted on the island?

26:17.457 --> 26:18.990
Well, Steve doesn't want
to go public yet.

26:18.992 --> 26:20.826
He thinks we stand a better
chance of catching Pelham

26:20.828 --> 26:22.327
if, uh, he doesn't know
we're onto him.

26:22.329 --> 26:23.995
Got something?

26:23.997 --> 26:26.164
Yeah. CSU just finished
searching Pelham's place.

26:26.166 --> 26:27.132
They found several phony

26:27.134 --> 26:29.000
passports and
driver's licenses.

26:29.002 --> 26:30.969
All told, this guy has

26:30.971 --> 26:32.304
seven different aliases.
All right, well,

26:32.306 --> 26:33.638
let's run all of 'em.
With any luck,

26:33.640 --> 26:35.640
he'll try and use one of 'em
to get off the island.

26:39.278 --> 26:40.745
DANNY:
<i>Do you know how many times</i>

26:40.747 --> 26:42.180
that I've dropped
Grace off?

26:42.182 --> 26:44.082
You know how many times
I've picked her up,

26:44.084 --> 26:45.851
and that kid's been
sitting in the room?

26:45.853 --> 26:47.319
Rachel, too,
sitting there?

26:47.321 --> 26:49.074
Danny, no matter how
misguided this was...

26:49.098 --> 26:50.122
Please, don't.

26:50.123 --> 26:52.324
Do not say anything that
sticks up for this woman, okay?

26:52.326 --> 26:54.459
What she did is unforgiveable,
and that is the bottom line.

26:54.461 --> 26:55.660
And because of what she did,

26:55.662 --> 26:57.462
I missed out three years
of this kid's life.

26:57.464 --> 27:00.165
Huh? What about that?

27:01.033 --> 27:03.268
So what happens now?

27:03.270 --> 27:05.670
Now. Now, I-I take care
of the kid.

27:05.672 --> 27:07.105
But Rachel-- I don't
know what I'm gonna do.

27:07.107 --> 27:09.007
No way I get past this.

27:09.009 --> 27:10.141
You're right, man.

27:10.143 --> 27:12.844
I know I'm right.
Thank you.

27:12.846 --> 27:14.980
Do me a favor-- listen to me
for a second, all right?

27:14.982 --> 27:18.316
These feelings
that you're having, this anger--

27:18.318 --> 27:20.018
you got to put it aside,
that's all I'm saying.

27:20.020 --> 27:22.087
How many decisions
are you guys gonna have

27:22.089 --> 27:23.655
to make, from here on in?

27:23.657 --> 27:25.590
And you and Rachel-- you got
to make the decisions together.

27:25.592 --> 27:27.859
Danny, it's not gonna
do Charlie any good

27:27.861 --> 27:28.994
having his parents fighting.

27:28.996 --> 27:30.362
That's all I'm
trying to say.

27:30.364 --> 27:31.630
I know that.
You're right.

27:31.632 --> 27:33.098
All right?
(phone ringing)

27:36.269 --> 27:37.802
Yeah, Chin, what's up?

27:37.804 --> 27:39.204
CHIN:
So we ran

27:39.206 --> 27:41.239
all of Pelham's aliases,
turns out he used one

27:41.241 --> 27:43.541
to purchase a plane ticket
online, just a few minutes ago.

27:43.543 --> 27:46.278
Well, did you trace the IP?
Yeah, it's an apartment downtown.

27:46.280 --> 27:47.846
We think the owner
of the place is one

27:47.848 --> 27:48.847
of Pelham's dog-walking clients.

27:48.849 --> 27:50.248
Yeah, it looks like
he could be using

27:50.250 --> 27:51.249
the apartment as a safe house.

27:51.251 --> 27:52.550

29:09.484 --> 29:11.151
Poor man's GPS.

29:11.153 --> 29:12.453
This is how he found us.

29:12.455 --> 29:13.787
Malloy probably
planted that

29:13.789 --> 29:15.723
while we were still
at Pelham's place.

29:15.725 --> 29:16.824
Yeah, we underestimated him.

29:16.826 --> 29:18.192
Clearly, he's not as
dumb as he looks.

29:18.194 --> 29:19.860
Well, let's look
at the bright side,

29:19.862 --> 29:21.495
at least Pelham's
in custody, right?

29:21.497 --> 29:23.163
Pelham already killed a bounty
hunter while he was in custody.

29:23.165 --> 29:25.232
Until he's in our custody,
I'm not gonna rest easy.

29:25.234 --> 29:27.401

29:31.539 --> 29:33.374
What is that?

29:34.776 --> 29:36.744
Little something

29:36.746 --> 29:40.481
Got to deliver you
alive and intact,

29:40.483 --> 29:42.816

29:42.818 --> 29:45.152
I got money,
you know.

29:45.154 --> 29:46.587
Could pay you a lot more

29:46.589 --> 29:47.955
that bail bondsman
will give you.

29:52.994 --> 29:54.862
You think I can be bought?

29:56.665 --> 29:58.732
KONO: <i>So I tried pinging</i>
<i>Malloy's cell,</i>

29:58.734 --> 30:00.000
but it's been turned off.

30:00.002 --> 30:02.069
And, uh... we're tracking
his credit cards,

30:02.071 --> 30:03.837
but I can't imagine
he'll be using them.

30:03.839 --> 30:05.706
What about his car?
Well, HPD plate readers are

30:05.708 --> 30:07.274
scanning every car on the road--
so far, nothing.

30:07.276 --> 30:09.009
Well, after Malloy
grabbed Pelham,

30:09.011 --> 30:10.644
he probably threw on
some new plates.

30:10.646 --> 30:12.346
Either that or he had
a switch-car nearby.

30:12.348 --> 30:13.447
All right, here's
the problem.

30:13.449 --> 30:14.715
We are working at a
major disadvantage.

30:14.717 --> 30:16.016
We're trying to find somebody

30:16.018 --> 30:17.851
who finds people who don't want
to be found for a living.

30:17.853 --> 30:20.688
I mean, he's got tricks, he's
hip to stuff that we don't know.

30:20.690 --> 30:21.922
Danny's right--
we want to find Malloy,

30:21.924 --> 30:23.691
we're gonna need some help.

30:28.530 --> 30:30.998
Hey, Dog.

McGarrett, Williams--

What's up, buddy,
you got a minute?

30:34.637 --> 30:36.236
Yeah, let me book this lolo,
I'll be right back, all right?

30:36.238 --> 30:38.305
Uh, we can handle it.

30:38.307 --> 30:39.940
Officers, do me a favor,
take this guy in,

30:39.942 --> 30:42.343
process him and get a
body receipt, please?

30:42.345 --> 30:44.111
All right, thank you.

30:44.113 --> 30:46.046
Mahalo.

30:46.048 --> 30:47.715
Boy, this must be
pretty important

30:47.717 --> 30:49.350
with that kind of service.
Yeah, it is.

30:49.352 --> 30:50.684
We're, uh,
we're actually looking

30:50.686 --> 30:52.353
for a fellow bounty hunter,
his name's Malloy.

30:52.355 --> 30:54.121
He has a dangerous
fugitive with him.

30:54.123 --> 30:55.823
He's trying to get off
the island right now.

30:55.825 --> 30:57.958
Under no circumstances
can we let that happen.

30:57.960 --> 31:01.061
So you want to know what
this cat's next move is, right?

31:01.063 --> 31:03.063
Yeah, yeah, I mean, if it
was you, what would you do?

31:03.065 --> 31:05.165
How would you get him
back to the mainland?

31:05.167 --> 31:06.467
Yeah, we need
some trade secrets, Dog,

31:06.469 --> 31:08.035
some insider info--
can you help us out?

31:09.070 --> 31:10.938
So this is on the DL, right?

31:11.773 --> 31:14.041
There is a way off this rock

31:14.043 --> 31:16.477
that only people in my line
of work know about.

31:18.546 --> 31:20.581
You ever heard of Transair?
Yeah, I have.

31:20.583 --> 31:22.483
It's a cargo plane
for deliveries.

31:22.485 --> 31:24.385
Yep, for cash up front,

31:24.387 --> 31:26.053
they'll ferry
the bounty hunter and his prey

31:26.055 --> 31:28.989
to and from the mainland,
no questions asked,

31:28.991 --> 31:30.257
no paperwork,

31:30.259 --> 31:32.159
all under the radar.

31:35.330 --> 31:37.431
DANNY: <i>Dog told us that</i>
<i>there's a Transair flight</i>

31:37.433 --> 31:38.433
<i>that lands at midnight,</i>

31:38.434 --> 31:39.767
midnight every night,

31:39.769 --> 31:41.101
in Los Angeles--
you understand what that means.

31:41.103 --> 31:42.703
It's gonna take off any second.
I did the math.

31:42.705 --> 31:44.405
So you understand
that we're gonna be late.

31:44.407 --> 31:46.073
(phone ringing) The only way this vehicle
is gonna

31:46.075 --> 31:48.008
go any faster is if you throw
yourself out of it.

31:48.010 --> 31:50.110
Chin, what do you got?
CHIN: We may have a problem.

31:50.112 --> 31:52.513
Kono and I have been monitoring
Malloy's financials,

31:52.515 --> 31:54.681
and we came across
a six-figure wire transfer

31:54.683 --> 31:55.849
from an offshore account.

31:55.851 --> 31:57.918
Transaction happened
less than an hour ago.

31:57.920 --> 31:59.053
What six figures?

31:59.055 --> 32:01.588
Uh, Malloy was getting
$40,000, he said.

32:01.590 --> 32:03.357
Yeah, so we're thinking
this money came from Pelham.

32:03.359 --> 32:06.026
He paid Malloy to let him go.

32:06.028 --> 32:09.963
(engine revving)

32:09.965 --> 32:11.298
(tires screeching)

32:11.300 --> 32:12.900
Fueling the bird right now.

32:12.902 --> 32:14.802
Should be wheels down
by 12:00 a.m.

32:14.804 --> 32:16.336
(siren whoops)

32:16.338 --> 32:17.838
But I might be delayed.

32:22.811 --> 32:25.012
Malloy, man, I got...

32:25.014 --> 32:27.314
You're a piece of work, buddy.
MALLOY: Hey, listen, I can understand

32:27.316 --> 32:30.284
if you're a little upset about
getting punked back there.

32:33.788 --> 32:36.190
Uncalled for.
Hey, you let that monster go.

32:36.192 --> 32:37.437
you're lucky we don't put
a bullet in your ass.

32:37.461 --> 32:39.094
STEVE:
You aided and abetted.

32:39.095 --> 32:40.761
All right, you want
to stay out of prison?

32:40.763 --> 32:42.096
You give us
something, right now,

32:42.098 --> 32:43.964
that helps us find
Pelham right now.

32:43.966 --> 32:45.632
Well, you're wrong.

32:45.634 --> 32:47.601
I didn't let him go.

32:47.603 --> 32:49.870
<i>I delivered him</i>
<i>to Malcolm Leddy.</i>

32:49.872 --> 32:51.705
He came to me a few months ago,

32:51.707 --> 32:54.808
<i>offered me 300 thou,</i>
<i>his entire life savings.</i>

32:54.810 --> 32:58.212
<i>All I had to do was</i>
<i>deliver the man</i>

32:58.214 --> 33:00.114
<i>that murdered his daughter.</i>

33:00.116 --> 33:02.583
So what happened after
you handed Pelham over?

33:02.585 --> 33:04.218
I don't know.

33:04.220 --> 33:06.420
Me and Leddy traded cars,
I took off.

33:06.422 --> 33:08.522
All right, you think Leddy
killed him right there?

33:08.524 --> 33:10.557
No. I think he wants
to take his time.

33:20.835 --> 33:22.169
How do we find him?

33:22.171 --> 33:24.805
I don't know-- he didn't exactly
share his plans with me.

33:24.807 --> 33:26.173
Well, you must have
his cell phone number.

33:26.175 --> 33:27.841
You guys kept in touch, no?

33:29.010 --> 33:30.978
JENNIFER:
Hey, Daddy, just wanted

33:30.980 --> 33:34.081
to wish the sweetest, kindest,
most handsome dad

33:34.083 --> 33:35.449
a happy Father's Day.

33:35.451 --> 33:37.017
I love you so, so much.

33:37.019 --> 33:39.686
And I'm just so thankful
to be your daughter.

33:39.688 --> 33:42.256
Have an awesome day, buddy.

33:46.461 --> 33:48.328
Hey, Daddy, just wanted

33:48.330 --> 33:51.465
to wish the sweetest, kindest,
most handsome dad

33:51.467 --> 33:52.833
a happy Father's Day.

33:52.835 --> 33:54.334
I love you so...

33:55.403 --> 33:57.271
Hello, Mr. Pelham.

34:05.480 --> 34:08.248
What is this?

34:13.087 --> 34:15.088
Karma.

34:15.090 --> 34:17.424
Comeuppance.

34:17.426 --> 34:19.927
I know you.

34:19.929 --> 34:22.929
You're the guy,

34:22.931 --> 34:25.666
the one who went on television.

34:25.668 --> 34:27.134
Jenny's dad.

34:27.136 --> 34:30.103
Don't...

34:30.105 --> 34:33.306
Don't you dare
say her name.

34:34.309 --> 34:35.976
(blade scraping)

34:35.978 --> 34:37.811
What do you know
about me, Mr. Pelham?

34:37.813 --> 34:39.379
Anything?

34:39.380 --> 34:40.714
Nothing?

34:40.716 --> 34:42.583
Well, let me fill you in.

34:42.585 --> 34:44.251
I went to med school,
but I dropped out

34:44.253 --> 34:45.953
during my first year
of residency.

34:45.955 --> 34:50.757
I quit because my wife
passed away very suddenly.

34:50.759 --> 34:52.993
Our daughter was only
a year at the time.

34:54.462 --> 34:58.398
But I remember everything
they taught me.

34:58.400 --> 35:03.003
I know how much pain a person
can endure before passing out.

35:04.239 --> 35:05.939
I know how long
it takes to recover.

35:05.941 --> 35:09.409
I know how to keep
a person alive,

35:09.411 --> 35:12.346
even when letting them die
would be more humane.

35:15.650 --> 35:18.151
(chains clinking)

35:19.020 --> 35:20.721
When this is all over,

35:20.723 --> 35:24.358
you will beg me to kill you.

35:24.360 --> 35:26.560
(cell phone rings)

35:29.230 --> 35:31.098
What is it?

35:31.100 --> 35:32.699
This is Commander McGarrett
of Five-O.

35:32.701 --> 35:34.968
Starting the trace.

35:34.970 --> 35:36.370
STEVE:
Mr. Leddy.

35:36.372 --> 35:38.739
Mr. Leddy, are you there?

35:38.741 --> 35:41.541
I'm here.

35:41.543 --> 35:42.843
It's not a good time.

35:42.845 --> 35:44.177
Sir, please listen to me.

35:44.179 --> 35:45.545
I know why you came here.

35:45.547 --> 35:47.180
I know what you came here to do.

35:47.182 --> 35:49.116
And I'm begging you not
to go through with this.

35:49.118 --> 35:50.717
It's not gonna accomplish
anything, sir.

35:50.719 --> 35:52.085
It won't...

35:52.087 --> 35:53.420
Bring back my daughter?

35:53.422 --> 35:56.056
Bring me peace?

35:56.058 --> 35:58.725
You want me to just...
turn this all over

35:58.727 --> 36:00.727
to the criminal justice
system, is that it?

36:00.729 --> 36:02.029
Yes.

36:02.031 --> 36:03.497
Yeah, they've done such
a bang-up job so far.

36:03.499 --> 36:04.531
Sir, please.

36:04.533 --> 36:06.533
I understand wanting vengeance.

36:06.535 --> 36:08.235
I swear to you, I do--
but killing Pelham,

36:08.237 --> 36:10.370
it'll feel good
for a moment, but that's it.

36:10.372 --> 36:13.206
Now, we got enough evidence
to put this bastard away.

36:13.208 --> 36:15.575
I want him in a prison cell,
sir, not you.

36:15.577 --> 36:18.578
What makes you think
I'm going to prison?

36:18.580 --> 36:21.381
When you get here,
you're gonna find two bodies.

36:23.918 --> 36:25.252
Think about Jenny.

36:25.254 --> 36:26.586
Would she really want this?

36:26.588 --> 36:27.621
You're not a killer.

36:27.623 --> 36:29.289
You don't know me.

36:29.291 --> 36:30.590
And you didn't know her.

36:30.592 --> 36:32.192
KONO:
Guys, we got him.

36:32.194 --> 36:34.428
He's in Waimanalo.

36:34.430 --> 36:35.595
(horn honks)

36:37.632 --> 36:40.701
LEDDY:
I want him to suffer.

36:40.703 --> 36:42.469
I want him to suffer
the way she suffered.

36:42.471 --> 36:43.804
STEVE:
He's a cop, okay?

36:43.806 --> 36:45.806
He's a cop, and I'm gonna
put him in prison.

36:45.808 --> 36:47.541
You think he's gonna have
an easy time in there?

36:47.543 --> 36:49.743
He will suffer, you have
my word, he will suffer.

36:49.745 --> 36:51.345
Malcolm, wherever you are,
please,

36:51.347 --> 36:53.213
I'm begging you,
please walk away.

36:53.215 --> 36:54.215
I'm begging you.

36:54.216 --> 36:55.716
Sorry.

36:55.718 --> 36:57.217
Can't do it.

36:58.119 --> 36:59.486
Malcolm...

36:59.488 --> 37:00.987
Malcolm.

37:14.012 --> 37:15.680
The medical examiner...

37:15.682 --> 37:18.716
thought you might have
started with her fingers.

37:18.718 --> 37:20.851
Is that right?

37:23.388 --> 37:24.722
Who can remember?

37:42.107 --> 37:43.541
(Pelham screams)

37:43.543 --> 37:45.543
(bone cracks)

37:45.545 --> 37:47.645
(shuddering, groaning)

37:49.247 --> 37:50.081
(yells)

37:50.083 --> 37:51.615
Going to voice mail.

37:51.617 --> 37:53.117
Try it again.

37:59.057 --> 38:02.026
Next, you cut off
her scalp...

38:02.028 --> 38:03.260
didn't you?

38:15.307 --> 38:16.841
(screams)

38:23.582 --> 38:26.050
(crying):
I'm sorry, Jenny.

38:26.052 --> 38:29.053
Not so easy
in the moment, is it?

38:31.990 --> 38:33.924
It's funny.

38:33.926 --> 38:36.160
How you could think
about nothing else.

38:37.329 --> 38:38.996
Work it over in your mind,

38:38.998 --> 38:40.998
gaming it out.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.901
All the ways it could go down.

38:43.903 --> 38:46.003
Everything that
could go wrong.

38:46.005 --> 38:48.506
Until it's happening...

38:50.776 --> 38:53.911
...you don't really know if
you can go through with it.

38:53.913 --> 38:56.113
(laughs, shudders)

39:00.552 --> 39:02.553
That's right.

39:02.555 --> 39:04.922
Call the police.

39:04.924 --> 39:07.458
Have them do what you can't.

Hey, guys...

41:20.159 --> 41:21.992
hold on for a second.

41:29.200 --> 41:30.501
I'm gonna put that man away,

41:30.503 --> 41:31.835
and he's never gonna
get out, all right?

41:31.837 --> 41:33.370
And that's the way
it should be.

41:34.806 --> 41:36.674

You're gonna

Yeah, I'm just

Hey.

42:58.157 --> 42:59.390
Hi.

43:01.593 --> 43:03.127
They're running about
five minutes behind.

43:03.129 --> 43:05.896
Okay, so can I, um, sign
something or anything or...?

43:05.898 --> 43:07.498
They'll take care of the
paperwork when they call you.

43:07.500 --> 43:09.233
Okay.

43:12.637 --> 43:14.571
Hey, buddy.

43:14.573 --> 43:16.106
What do you got
there, huh?

43:16.108 --> 43:17.307
Is that a rescue truck?

43:17.309 --> 43:19.276
Rescue truck.
Yeah, I used to have one

43:19.278 --> 43:20.878
just like this one, same thing.

43:20.880 --> 43:22.746
Can I see it? Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

43:22.748 --> 43:25.249
How does this thing work?
Does it light up?

43:25.251 --> 43:26.717
Of course it lights up,
what a stupid question.

43:26.719 --> 43:27.685
I know it lights up.

43:27.687 --> 43:29.186
There's a button
right there.

43:30.121 --> 43:31.488
Oh, there it goes.

43:36.061 --> 43:37.294
You know what?

43:37.296 --> 43:40.297
You like fire trucks,
I like fire trucks.

43:40.299 --> 43:42.633
