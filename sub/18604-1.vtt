Apparently, people don't
get drunk before noon.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.595
- Mmm.
- It's boring as shit.

01:09.720 --> 01:11.631

want us there, so...

01:11.760 --> 01:12.954
Sure.

Anyways,
after a year of negotiation,

01:14.960 --> 01:16.109
your divorce is finalised.

These are the terms
we agreed to.

01:18.560 --> 01:19.959
The alimony,

01:20.200 --> 01:21.952
the house. Sorry.

01:22.000 --> 01:23.956
Don't worry about it.
It's only money.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.638
It is only

01:26.600 --> 01:28.158
all of the money.

01:28.920 --> 01:30.911
But it's the season
for giving, right?

01:30.960 --> 01:32.518
I know how you feel.

01:32.720 --> 01:34.711
Oh, yeah? I didn't know
you were divorced.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.592
Oh, God, no.
That'd be crushing.

01:36.840 --> 01:37.955
- Hmm.
- But I get it.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.957
On one level,
it must seem like, uh,

01:47.960 --> 01:49.916
- No, that's it. Uh, initials.
- Oh.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.956
Hey. There are good things
ahead for you, okay?

01:53.160 --> 01:54.513
- Yeah. Oh.
- Come here.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.751
- Thank you. Thanks, buddy.
- Merry Christmas.

01:56.960 --> 01:58.951
- Hey, what's this?
- My final bill's in there.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.951
- Is it?
- Oh, also my holiday card.

and the kids dress up

Well, you should tell Dad

02:31.600 --> 02:33.989
that she is not coming over
for Christmas.

02:35.320 --> 02:37.959
Why?
Because we're divorced, Mum!

02:38.000 --> 02:40.070
Well... Oh, Mum,
don't worry about that.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.354

(STAMMERS)
Well, without doing that.

02:47.280 --> 02:49.794
No, you can leave
the Santa suit in the attic.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.193
Why? Because I'm an adult

02:52.400 --> 02:54.550
and dressing up as Santa Claus
would be embarrassing.

02:55.960 --> 02:59.191
Hi. Unless, you know,
you're doing it for charity.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.318
Then it's... Then it's, um...

03:01.400 --> 03:02.549
Sorry.

- Oh, yeah.

Give me the green light...

- Mmm-hmm.
- ...and I'll shut it down.

It's awesome.

that I have been clear about

can be unbuttoned on a shirt.

- It's winter. Can we

put Dancer and Prancer
back in their stable?

about her so much at work.

those guys jealous.

that means

what you want it to mean.

your opinion on something.

Yeah, can't hand that out.

feeling kind of a

09:01.120 --> 09:02.599

09:02.720 --> 09:03.960
definitely not
Christmas spirit.

I can't argue with you there.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.358
Good. I want to
Secret Santa the shit

09:07.520 --> 09:08.953
out of the staff meeting.
Come on.

09:09.160 --> 09:10.513
(SIGHS)

09:10.600 --> 09:12.158
Can we work and walk?

09:12.960 --> 09:14.951
You're not cold
without a big coat on?

09:14.960 --> 09:16.712
No, I gain fifteen pounds
every winter

09:16.800 --> 09:17.949
so I don't have to wear one.

09:18.080 --> 09:20.514
- Huh. That's a healthy choice.
- Not really.

09:20.720 --> 09:23.280
Hey, are you bringing anybody
to this wine and cheese thing?

09:23.520 --> 09:24.919
Uh, no, I'll be there solo.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.713
Good. Smart. So you can
focus on Tracey, right?

09:28.400 --> 09:30.914
Tracey and I work together.
What are you talking about?

09:30.960 --> 09:33.190
I'm just saying. I can't be
your work wife forever.

09:33.400 --> 09:34.936
Hey, how fast do you think
you'd have to go

09:34.960 --> 09:36.552
- to make that jump?
- Uh...

09:36.760 --> 09:38.056
- Boy, I don't know. In a car?
- Yeah.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.957
I just never
thought about that.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.991
You know,
your mind's like a drunk baby.

09:42.120 --> 09:43.240
What do you think, 80 or 90?

09:43.320 --> 09:45.754
What would Vin do? Vin Diesel?
Or Tyrese?

09:45.960 --> 09:48.758
They'd never make it, right?
It's suicide. Unless

09:48.960 --> 09:50.576
you were going 120, you put
a bunch of free weights

09:50.600 --> 09:52.080
in the trunk to even it out,
you know,

09:52.120 --> 09:53.951
then you just catch air.
Boosh!

09:53.960 --> 09:56.110
"Fuck you, gravity,
and you, Dom Toretto!"

09:56.200 --> 09:57.315
Then... (WHOOSHES)

09:57.960 --> 09:59.880
...just a smooth landing,
like a baby's buttocks.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.951
I'd love to pick
this up indoors.

10:02.320 --> 10:03.816
You know, I've only ever seen
the first film,

10:03.840 --> 10:04.955
so I don't know
if I'm much help to you

10:04.960 --> 10:06.109
in this conversation. So...

10:06.320 --> 10:08.136
Are you serious? Why am I
just hearing about this?

10:08.160 --> 10:09.536
We've worked together
for eight years.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.994
They only get more fast!
More furious!

10:12.400 --> 10:13.958
I love this place.

10:14.120 --> 10:17.192
So, what would people want?
Would they like... Ooh!

10:17.560 --> 10:19.915
Is this UV?
Is UV good or bad? I forget.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.111
- (GROANS)
- Not good for the eyes, no.

10:22.200 --> 10:23.376
CLAY: Does it do
anything here?

10:23.400 --> 10:24.515
Probably. Is this for

10:24.600 --> 10:25.736
- teeth whitening?
- WOMAN: No.

10:25.760 --> 10:27.751
Okay, what about this, right?

10:27.960 --> 10:29.136
Everybody gets
stressed at work...

10:29.160 --> 10:30.376
- (VIBRATING)
- ...around this time of year.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.515
JOSH: Huh.

10:31.600 --> 10:34.068
That could get you
a sexual harassment suit.

10:34.160 --> 10:35.195
What? Why?

10:35.320 --> 10:36.958
Not everyone likes dildos
for Christmas.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.195
This isn't a dildo.
It's a body massager.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.709
Yeah, well, it's a circumcised
purple penis.

10:41.800 --> 10:43.074
It could be considered sexual.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.315
Why is it like that?

10:44.400 --> 10:46.391
Everything here
could be considered sexual.

10:46.640 --> 10:48.392
Hey, what about this
for Alan from legal?

10:48.800 --> 10:50.296
- (TRIMMER WHIRRING)
- Well, Alan's bald.

10:50.320 --> 10:51.896
(SIGHS) It's so hard
to shop for the bald.

10:51.920 --> 10:53.160
Who are they?
What do they want?

10:53.760 --> 10:54.829
Hair.

10:54.960 --> 10:57.056
You know, maybe we should just
go get some gift cards.

10:57.080 --> 10:58.559
That's exactly
what we should do!

10:58.760 --> 10:59.954
"Here's a gift card
because I don't know you

10:59.960 --> 11:02.110
"and I don't care and I won't
get in trouble for it."

11:02.320 --> 11:03.576
You know,
when my dad ran this company,

11:03.600 --> 11:05.318
Christmas was
actually a big deal.

11:05.560 --> 11:06.880
At the Christmas party
every year,

11:06.920 --> 11:07.955
he would dress up
like Santa Claus,

11:07.960 --> 11:09.757
get everybody fucked up.

11:09.960 --> 11:10.949
Yeah, you could back then.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.791
He would throw gifts
into the crowd.

11:12.960 --> 11:15.952
Derek Peterson shattered his
femur for a rotisserie set.

11:15.960 --> 11:18.080
And that was before Boston
Chicken was, like, a thing.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.400
- I've heard those stories.
- He took care of them.

11:20.760 --> 11:23.399
That's what I want
for my people. You know?

11:23.760 --> 11:25.193
And I want that drone.

11:26.400 --> 11:27.992
Clay, let me ask you
a question.

11:28.200 --> 11:32.637
You think that my management
style is... Is too careful?

11:32.960 --> 11:35.110
Uh, do you think that I bunt

11:35.200 --> 11:36.952
instead of swing
for the fences?

11:37.120 --> 11:39.111
I want to be completely honest
with you, Josh.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.601
I wasn't paying attention, so
I didn't hear your question.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.440
- I can repeat it.
- I'd rather you didn't.

11:43.640 --> 11:45.915
Because I can tell by
your face that it's serious.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.632
And I want
to tell you seriously,

11:47.840 --> 11:49.956
it's almost Christmas. Relax.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.758
- You want some of this?
- I think so.

11:51.960 --> 11:53.296
- I don't think you do.
- You sure?

11:53.320 --> 11:54.520
I think you better get moving.

11:54.560 --> 11:55.754
CLAY: Uh-oh. Here he goes!

11:55.840 --> 11:57.193
- (NERF GUN WHIRS)
- CLAY: Huh?

11:57.320 --> 11:59.390
- Eat that! Eat it, Clay!
- (EXCLAIMS)

11:59.560 --> 12:01.240

Hey, uh, Allison? Right?

12:55.600 --> 12:56.919
- Yeah.
- I'm Fred.

12:56.960 --> 12:57.960
I just joined accounting.

12:58.520 --> 12:59.589
Hi.

12:59.720 --> 13:02.518
(SIGHS) Um, so, I saw
that photo on your desk.

13:02.600 --> 13:03.715
Are those your kids?

13:03.800 --> 13:05.916
- Yep. They're two and four.
- Oh.

13:05.960 --> 13:07.712
I'm a single mum. Ugh.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.149
That's great.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.589
- I was raised by a single mum.
- Really?

13:11.800 --> 13:13.240
Yeah. If you ask me,
Tupac was right.

13:20.360 --> 13:21.554
Oh, shit.

13:22.160 --> 13:23.354
Allison.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.280
- Where's Clay?
- He's unreachable.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.989
He's participating
in a conference... Summit...

13:29.400 --> 13:30.958
Elon Musk, uh,

13:31.280 --> 13:33.840
tech participation... Relay.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.399
Let's try that again.

13:35.640 --> 13:36.959
Allison, where's Clay?

13:37.080 --> 13:38.957
- He's Christmas shopping.
- Okay.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.839
I would like
all department heads

13:40.960 --> 13:42.837
in the conference room
in five minutes.

13:43.600 --> 13:44.736
Tell him to stop
looking at me.

13:44.760 --> 13:45.795
ALLISON: Look away.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.957
Ooh. No, he's cute. Oh.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.389
Actually...

13:51.560 --> 13:53.710
It's like the calling
never stops.

13:53.920 --> 13:55.512

It's so annoying.

13:59.920 --> 14:02.992
CAROL: Ugh! You have
got to be shitting me.

14:04.640 --> 14:06.119
So the bartender says,

14:06.200 --> 14:07.936
"We don't see many gorillas."
And the gorilla says,

14:07.960 --> 14:10.394
"Well, at $12 for a martini
I can see why not."

14:10.640 --> 14:11.959
You know a lot
of gorilla jokes.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.110
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

14:14.400 --> 14:16.994
What's going on?
Something's off.

14:17.400 --> 14:18.958
Yeah, everyone's working.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.153
CLAY: Oh, shitster.

14:21.600 --> 14:22.953
It's my sister.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.949
There she is!
My sister from another mister!

14:26.000 --> 14:27.319
I'm kidding, our mother

14:27.400 --> 14:28.696
didn't start having affairs
until the mid-90s.

14:28.720 --> 14:29.755
What are you doing here?

14:29.960 --> 14:32.758
Well, we were just going over
your fourth quarter earnings.

14:32.960 --> 14:34.496
And I wondered
if I was missing something.

14:34.520 --> 14:35.748
Probably.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.911
Clay, why don't you
have a seat?

14:38.640 --> 14:42.189
Uh, no. It's my branch,
so I prefer to stand.

14:42.840 --> 14:43.909
Fine.

14:44.000 --> 14:46.958
Allison, would you please
remove Clay's chair?

14:47.000 --> 14:49.560
- Uh, sure.
- Thank you.

14:49.960 --> 14:50.960
Sorry.

14:51.760 --> 14:52.954
Thank you, Allison.

14:55.200 --> 14:56.952
So we were all
a little bit disappointed

14:57.080 --> 14:59.196
not to hit 7% growth
in this last quarter.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.392
But 6.5% is right on industry
standard for the fall.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.951
Mmm-mmm. You need to hit 12%.

15:05.400 --> 15:07.311
- Twelve?
- Twelve is the new seven.

15:07.560 --> 15:08.629
- What?
- Since when?

15:08.760 --> 15:10.079
- (ALL MURMUR)
- Since Dad died

15:10.160 --> 15:11.832
and the board made me CEO.

15:11.960 --> 15:13.951
Oh. You mean interim CEO.

15:14.160 --> 15:18.153
Shut up. Listen, essentially,
this branch is failing.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.958
6.5% is not failing.

15:20.000 --> 15:21.115
Yes, it is.

15:21.200 --> 15:22.376
We're doing
better than Orlando.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.959

had mono last year, right?

15:24.960 --> 15:25.960

(FARTING)

15:34.120 --> 15:35.314
I am sorry.

15:35.760 --> 15:38.752
Damn it.
I hate tension, and I...

15:39.200 --> 15:40.315
I farted.

15:40.560 --> 15:41.595
- Wow.
- You are not

15:41.720 --> 15:42.948
selling enough servers.

15:43.560 --> 15:46.950
You have no new ideas
and there is no new revenue.

15:47.400 --> 15:49.197
- I have something new.
- Really?

15:49.400 --> 15:50.958
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

15:51.160 --> 15:52.896
- (WHISPERS) It's not ready.
- (WHISPERS) It is ready.

- It's not ready.
- It is ready.

- CAROL: Uh, we can hear you.
- Yeah, sorry.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.951
We can.
It's a completely silent room.

15:58.160 --> 15:59.354
- Go ahead.
- (STAMMERS)

16:00.720 --> 16:02.790
What's the most annoying thing
about the Internet?

16:03.280 --> 16:05.919
- Pictures of people's kids.
- Linkedln invites.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.110
My girlfriend's always on it.
I have a girlfriend.

16:08.320 --> 16:10.959
The lack of Asian
male representation in porn.

It's like... It's Garfield.

16:13.320 --> 16:15.390
Oh, you know that orange
with the human dick?

16:15.640 --> 16:16.959
Oh, my God,
what is this, Shark Tank?

16:16.960 --> 16:18.440
Can you just get
to the point, please?

16:18.920 --> 16:21.388
- It's getting on the Internet.
- Mmm.

16:22.960 --> 16:24.776
TRACEY: So we can already
connect to the Internet

16:24.800 --> 16:25.949
through standard
electrical lines

16:25.960 --> 16:27.837
and obviously we can do it
through the air.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.998
But what if we could combine
those technologies?

16:31.360 --> 16:33.078
- (CHIMING)
- With Zenotek AnywAir,

16:33.320 --> 16:34.536
you can pull
the Internet wirelessly

16:34.560 --> 16:36.835
from anything that's connected
to a power grid.

16:37.560 --> 16:40.313
Your appliances.
Street lights. A light bulb.

16:40.760 --> 16:43.957
You're never out of range, and
you're never low on signal.

16:48.960 --> 16:50.598

16:50.800 --> 16:53.189
I'm still figuring out
some coding issues, but yes.

16:54.000 --> 16:55.956
Well, how long
have you been figuring?

16:56.120 --> 16:57.951
- Four years.
- Four years?

16:58.320 --> 17:00.390
All right, well, that doesn't
sound very real to me.

17:00.640 --> 17:02.710
Well, if it was real,
I wouldn't have to invent it.

17:02.800 --> 17:04.118
- (CHUCKLES)
- I'm sorry,

17:04.200 --> 17:06.111
- what's your name again?
- Tracey Hughes.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.200
it's on all of the recent
patents for Zenotek.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.069
Mmm-hmm.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.387
You know what? I'm gonna sit.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.313
Not because you told me to,
but because I

17:15.960 --> 17:17.108
prefer it.

17:18.119 --> 17:19.189
So...

17:20.720 --> 17:21.755
CAROL: Mmm-hmm.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.758
- Is there anything else?
- MARY: Actually, yes.

This is a sample cheeseboard
for our holiday mixer tonight.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.040
I know it's a little heavy
on the Gouda...

17:32.120 --> 17:33.633
That was the MVP last year.

17:33.840 --> 17:35.956
Uh, I do have a feisty Cheddar
on the bench.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.200
I think that pairs better with

17:37.280 --> 17:39.953
the mulled non-alcoholic wine
myself, but what do I know?

17:40.000 --> 17:41.558
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.
Excuse me.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.176
You're having
a Christmas party tonight?

17:43.200 --> 17:44.553
Oh, it's not
a Christmas party!

17:44.640 --> 17:47.200
It's a non-denominational
holiday mixer.

17:47.560 --> 17:48.629
More inclusive.

17:48.920 --> 17:51.150
Well, whatever the fuck it is,
it's not happening.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.360
Yeah, it's definitely...
Well, it's not "happenin"'

17:53.600 --> 17:55.320
because it happens
at 5:30 in the afternoon.

17:55.360 --> 17:56.509
It's just a small thing

17:56.600 --> 17:58.136
that's really important
to all of us, but

17:58.160 --> 18:00.515
- trust me, it's gonna suck.
- (CHUCKLES)

18:00.600 --> 18:03.068
No, it's not gonna suck,
because it's cancelled.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.514
What?

18:04.600 --> 18:06.511
All branch Christmas parties
are cancelled.

18:06.600 --> 18:07.635
It's a waste of money!

18:07.840 --> 18:09.751
Come on.
What are you guys not getting?

18:09.960 --> 18:11.837
All right, it's cancelled.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.115
(MOUTHS) It's not.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.391
Clay! I mean it.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.312
Me, too, Carol. Guys,

18:17.640 --> 18:18.816
the holiday mixer
is cancelled.

18:18.840 --> 18:19.909
- (MOUTHING)
- CAROL: Yes.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.391
Hey! It's cancelled, Clay!

18:22.640 --> 18:23.959
The thing is not happening
at all. (MOUTHING)

18:23.960 --> 18:25.096
CAROL: I'm not messing
with you.

18:25.120 --> 18:26.633
Hey! Stop doing that!

18:26.840 --> 18:28.990
Hey, idiot,
I'm looking right at you.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.949
I saw that! You whispered
to the farty cheese lady.

18:31.960 --> 18:32.995
Well...

18:33.400 --> 18:35.550
Don't make me pull rank, Clay.

18:35.960 --> 18:37.154
It is cancelled.

18:37.280 --> 18:38.759
(SIGHS) Fine!

18:38.840 --> 18:41.115
Then this meeting
is cancelled! Huh?

18:45.960 --> 18:47.712
Damn it! (BREATHING HEAVILY)

18:49.080 --> 18:50.798
I was keeping it light
in there.

18:50.920 --> 18:51.955
That was light, huh?

18:52.080 --> 18:53.957
You have to give her a break,
Josh. She's hated parties

18:53.960 --> 18:55.960
ever since she started
not getting invited to them.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.515
Please. That party's the least
of your problems.

19:00.120 --> 19:01.189
Is that Dad?

19:01.400 --> 19:03.277
No, Carol, I just have
some random guy's

19:03.360 --> 19:04.839
ashes in my office.

19:04.960 --> 19:05.960
Got it online.

19:06.080 --> 19:09.072
Yes. He wanted them here,
with me, at his branch.

19:09.640 --> 19:11.710
I thought they were gonna
divide him equally.

19:11.800 --> 19:12.936
It's not my fault
that he always liked

19:12.960 --> 19:13.949
hanging out with me more.

19:13.960 --> 19:15.951
I don't care.
I got this company.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.519
Moving on.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.791
We have a lot of
big cuts to make. Okay?

19:19.920 --> 19:22.070
Obviously, bonuses
are cancelled.

19:23.000 --> 19:24.956
You know,
there's a lot of people that

19:24.960 --> 19:26.393
are relying on those bonuses.

19:26.640 --> 19:28.835
I suppose you're still
getting your bonus, though.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.951
Secondly, I'm laying off
40% of your staff.

19:30.960 --> 19:32.393
(EXCLAIMS) Forty?

19:32.720 --> 19:35.951
Forty? We have 200 employees.
That's like, 60...

19:36.560 --> 19:38.596
- Some...
- That's 80. It's 80.

19:38.920 --> 19:40.592
Eighty. That's, like,
80 employees.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.789
Uh, you got to give us

19:41.920 --> 19:42.955
a little bit of time
to turn this around.

19:42.960 --> 19:44.880
Fine, then you have until
the end of the quarter.

19:44.920 --> 19:47.718
- That's two days.
- Is it? Oh, well.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.069
This is unfair.

19:49.320 --> 19:50.514
You wanna talk unfair?

19:50.600 --> 19:52.636
How about Dad skipping
my Harvard graduation

19:52.760 --> 19:53.960
to go with you to the X Games?

19:54.080 --> 19:55.593
And you weren't even
competing.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.790
You just sponsored
some guy's wakeboard.

19:57.960 --> 20:00.315
He got the bronze.
Which is brown gold.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.515
(CAROL SCOFFS)

20:01.600 --> 20:03.776
All right, so I've made a list
of my first round of layoffs.

20:03.800 --> 20:04.920
So you might wanna get a pen

20:04.960 --> 20:06.696
- and start writing these down.
- No. Let me see that.

20:06.720 --> 20:07.948
- No. No.
- Give me that.

20:08.080 --> 20:09.957
- No!
- These are my employees!

20:10.280 --> 20:11.936
- (CAROL GRUNTS)
- Guys, are we sure about this?

20:11.960 --> 20:13.279
Say you won't
make budget cuts.

20:13.360 --> 20:14.395
I swear to God, Clay!

20:14.560 --> 20:15.696
Here comes the loogie express!

20:15.720 --> 20:16.816
- Don't you dare!
- Say, "Everybody's

20:16.840 --> 20:18.840
- "gonna get a bonus," or else.
- You motherfucker.

20:18.960 --> 20:21.758
Suck that back in. You suck
that back in! You mother...

20:21.960 --> 20:23.951
- JOSH: Clay.
- (BOTH GRUNTING)

20:24.400 --> 20:25.958
- Oh, my God!
- (GRUNTING)

20:26.080 --> 20:27.752
Why do you do this
to yourself?

20:27.840 --> 20:29.512
You know I took
nine years of Krav Maga.

20:29.760 --> 20:31.637
Carol, you know,
he's turning blue.

20:31.840 --> 20:34.115
Yeah. Our family,
you got to tap out.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.551
- Tap out. Tap out.
- (COUGHING)

20:37.320 --> 20:39.311
- (PANTING)
- JOSH: Okay.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.997
- All right. You okay?
- (COUGHING)

20:43.000 --> 20:46.072
Dad gave you a free pass
your entire life,

20:46.160 --> 20:47.991
and you're not
getting one from me.

20:48.400 --> 20:49.976
The only way you're gonna hit
your targets this year

20:50.000 --> 20:52.309
is by cutting jobs.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.960
- (PANTING)
- Hey, what if we landed

20:55.000 --> 20:56.558
the Data City account?

20:56.800 --> 20:57.835
(SCOFFS)

20:57.960 --> 21:00.315
- Data City? Walter Davis?
- That's right.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.630
You do know that
he's already met with HP,

21:02.760 --> 21:03.829
Cisco and Oracle.

21:03.960 --> 21:05.518
Yeah, but he hasn't
heard our pitch.

21:05.600 --> 21:06.749
- No.
- (PANTING)

21:06.920 --> 21:08.956
Josh and I have been
drilling into it for weeks.

21:09.160 --> 21:10.957
Yeah. Months. Whole team.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.399
And we have a meeting

21:12.560 --> 21:13.959
- with him this afternoon.
- Yeah.

21:15.280 --> 21:16.349
All right.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.271
Well, I'm on a flight
to London tonight.

21:19.520 --> 21:22.717
So if by some miracle you guys
can close Walter Davis

21:22.920 --> 21:24.956
and his $14 million contract

21:24.960 --> 21:26.951
by the time
I land at Heathrow,

21:27.200 --> 21:28.633
the jobs are safe.

21:28.920 --> 21:29.955
Done!

21:30.080 --> 21:32.275
And you'll see,
you're gonna look so stupid.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.950
Then we'll finally
have something in common.

21:37.360 --> 21:39.590
Goddamn it! She's so mean!

21:40.200 --> 21:42.839
People are saying "cuts."
What kind of cuts?

21:42.960 --> 21:44.552
(STAMMERS)
Oh, nothing's official.

21:44.760 --> 21:45.896
Guys, I can barely
afford my rent.

21:45.920 --> 21:46.989
I'm sleeping in a closet.

21:47.120 --> 21:48.155
JOSH: Don't panic.

21:48.280 --> 21:49.376
You can't replace
the new guy, right?

21:49.400 --> 21:50.976
You're probably gonna go
with people that are older,

21:51.000 --> 21:52.176
- more expensive?
- Don't overreact.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.112
I just bought that used Lexus,
Josh. I can't give it back.

21:55.360 --> 21:56.793
I put rims on it, man!

21:56.960 --> 21:59.110
I have six parrots with
very expensive medical issues.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.315
You know this.

22:00.400 --> 22:01.958
I'm gonna have to
put one down.

22:01.960 --> 22:03.837
- Nobody is losing their jobs!
- Yeah.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.554
That is a Josh and Clay
Christmas promise.

22:06.840 --> 22:08.910
Your promises are dog shit!

22:09.960 --> 22:12.554
- Boy, they turned quick.
- Yeah, they sure did.

22:15.360 --> 22:17.920
Jesus. Incest and rape?

22:18.280 --> 22:19.713
I mean, that is dark.

22:20.160 --> 22:21.957
That could be
a different Clay.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.635
And Carol.

22:23.840 --> 22:25.034
We got to land this pitch.

22:26.400 --> 22:28.197
JOSH: Okay, everybody knows
what we're doing?

22:28.400 --> 22:30.640
Sure. We're just pitching to
save our company. No biggie.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.496
And we're proving that
my sister doesn't fuck me.

22:32.520 --> 22:34.192
- If anything, I fuck her!
- All right.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.960
Yeah, listen, I get
the spirit of that, but...

22:37.160 --> 22:39.151
We at Zenotek put the "client"

22:39.360 --> 22:42.955
in client-server
model service distribution.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.157
And this is a leave-behind.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.313
And we have
some new innovation

22:47.400 --> 22:50.312
that we can talk to you
about later. Later.

22:50.640 --> 22:53.712
You got to...
You got to go with us.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.399
Okay.

22:58.200 --> 22:59.952
Thank you for the pitch.

23:00.320 --> 23:03.392
Just give me a beat, and I'll
let you know my decision.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.913
Okay. When you say "beat,"
you're talking about an hour

23:07.960 --> 23:09.279
or a day? A full day?

23:09.600 --> 23:11.591
Certainly before the holidays,
I'd imagine, right?

23:11.960 --> 23:15.350
Listen, it's Christmas, so,
I'll be honest.

23:15.960 --> 23:18.190
Your servers are good.

23:18.640 --> 23:21.313
Dell's servers are good.

23:21.920 --> 23:23.273
- So...
- You're gonna go with us.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.957
- I'm gonna go with Dell.
- Fuck!

23:25.960 --> 23:27.188
- Why?
- Don't.

23:27.400 --> 23:28.628
I... I know your product.

23:28.760 --> 23:30.955
My problem is
with your culture.

23:31.640 --> 23:33.312
Our culture is great.

23:33.720 --> 23:34.948
WALTER:
That's not what I hear.

23:34.960 --> 23:37.269
Word is you're closing
branches and making layoffs.

23:37.520 --> 23:39.272
- That's not true.
- No, that's barely true.

23:39.520 --> 23:40.999
A mixture of
fabrication and rumour.

23:41.200 --> 23:43.760
Look, I get it.
You got to make money.

23:43.960 --> 23:45.916
And every quarter
you got to make more money.

23:46.000 --> 23:47.399
And if you got to
fire some people

23:47.560 --> 23:49.551
and cut back on some benefits
to make it happen,

23:49.760 --> 23:51.751
that's what business
is now, right?

23:51.960 --> 23:53.996
And as long as the board
has gotten its bonus

23:54.120 --> 23:56.395
and the stock is
ticking up? Come on.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.715
Sir, that's not who we are.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.640
If you came to our offices,
you would see that.

23:59.760 --> 24:01.000
You should come
meet our people.

24:01.320 --> 24:02.520
Yeah, we're a family business.

24:02.600 --> 24:03.840
TRACEY:
Everyone loves everyone.

24:03.960 --> 24:05.313
I mean, Clay and his sister,

24:05.400 --> 24:07.960
they're so close
it's almost inappropriate.

24:08.960 --> 24:11.190
We would love the opportunity
to prove you wrong.

24:11.640 --> 24:14.200
I'm sure you have wonderful
cubicles and great carpeting,

24:14.400 --> 24:16.118
but I've done
those tours before.

24:16.560 --> 24:17.959
I'm gonna pass.

24:17.960 --> 24:18.995
Um...

24:19.160 --> 24:20.195
Thank you so much.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.389
Oh, we got that.

24:21.560 --> 24:23.596
Oh, no, they've already put it
on my room.

24:23.720 --> 24:24.936
And in addition
to the breakfast

24:24.960 --> 24:27.269
my company
won't pay for anymore.

24:27.920 --> 24:28.955
Good luck, guys.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.113
Great. That was uplifting.

24:32.280 --> 24:33.315
He's saying we suck.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.958
Our big closer
was a thumb drive.

24:34.960 --> 24:35.960
Yeah, but we don't suck.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.336
We just need a way
to show him that.

24:37.360 --> 24:38.536
How are we gonna do that?
We're gonna

24:38.560 --> 24:40.520
invite him to our cancelled
wine and cheese night?

24:40.560 --> 24:42.073
No, we should take him out
for real.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.376
I mean, you heard him.
His company

24:43.400 --> 24:44.799
won't even buy him breakfast.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.951
He's an old school guy
who drinks scotch at lunch.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.510
We should take him out
and show him a great time.

24:49.720 --> 24:50.936
So we'll hook him up
with Don Draper,

24:50.960 --> 24:52.896
then go out and get
a couple of steaks and an STD.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.911
CLAY: No, no, no.
You're both right.

24:54.960 --> 24:55.949
We show him a great time

24:55.960 --> 24:57.951
at our office
Christmas party tonight.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.319
What? I didn't say that.

24:59.560 --> 25:00.959
- It's not the worst idea.
- Right?

25:01.000 --> 25:02.176
Of course it is.
We don't even have

25:02.200 --> 25:03.269
an office Christmas party.

25:03.360 --> 25:05.080
Carol said no
to all discretionary spending.

25:05.120 --> 25:06.951
She wants to lay off 40%.
You want to double that?

25:06.960 --> 25:08.552
My sister doesn't do anything
at 40%.

25:08.760 --> 25:09.896
She's just
cutting off our legs

25:09.920 --> 25:10.955
so we can't run away when she

25:10.960 --> 25:12.400
wants to fucking
curb-stomp our face.

25:12.560 --> 25:14.198
This is the way
we close Walter.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.440
We throw the best Christmas
party he's ever been to.

25:16.560 --> 25:18.755
He loves it, he loves us,
he sees we care about people,

25:18.840 --> 25:19.955
he falls in love
with our culture,

25:19.960 --> 25:20.995
he wants to work with us.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.191
This is how
we save everybody's job!

25:23.400 --> 25:25.197
I like it, Josh. Say yes.

25:25.360 --> 25:27.396
He's walking away,
unless you have a better idea.

25:27.760 --> 25:28.829
(SIGHS)

25:28.960 --> 25:30.000
That's your approval sigh.

25:30.760 --> 25:31.954
Walter?

25:32.640 --> 25:34.358
We have one more
pitch for you.

25:34.520 --> 25:35.555
Do you party?

25:37.960 --> 25:39.188
I used to.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.119
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

26:00.640 --> 26:01.959
Okay, so we have to throw

26:01.960 --> 26:03.951
a massive party
from scratch in

26:04.080 --> 26:05.195
five hours.

26:05.320 --> 26:07.176
Yeah. And we got an office
full of pissed-off employees.

26:07.200 --> 26:09.296
You guys, I got this. I have
a black belt in partying.

26:09.320 --> 26:10.896
That's why I got kicked out
of boarding school

26:10.920 --> 26:11.955
and two intensive care units.

26:11.960 --> 26:14.838
Listen. Did you see this?
"It's F-ing Christmas, B's.

26:14.960 --> 26:16.188
"Let's get mother-F-ing drunk.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.958
- "Attendance mandatory."
- Yeah.

26:18.000 --> 26:19.115
Lawsuit!

26:19.200 --> 26:20.680
Mary, it's for
the greater good, okay?

26:20.960 --> 26:22.136
Oh, Joel, would you
do me a favour?

26:22.160 --> 26:23.376
Would you get Fred up
to Clay's office?

26:23.400 --> 26:24.560
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

26:24.600 --> 26:25.953
- Wait!
- Yup.

26:25.960 --> 26:27.096
I don't know if it's helpful,

26:27.120 --> 26:28.256
but regarding
the music tonight,

26:28.280 --> 26:30.240
I happen to have a friend
who's a pretty good D.J.

26:30.760 --> 26:31.954
Great. Bring him.

26:32.200 --> 26:33.952
- See, we already got a D.J.
- Yep.

26:34.120 --> 26:35.951
Um, so let me
get this straight.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.349
Now we're having
this great party

26:38.520 --> 26:40.317
and we're getting
our bonuses at it.

26:40.640 --> 26:42.995
Yes, Jeremy,
because you deserve it!

26:43.200 --> 26:45.191
Maybe you shouldn't have
promised them bonuses.

26:45.320 --> 26:46.400
No, first rule of business:

26:46.560 --> 26:48.949
Shoot for the moon
and you'll land on the sun.

26:48.960 --> 26:50.712
I'd love to know
where you read that.

26:50.800 --> 26:52.320
And let's just focus
on closing Walter.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.958
You know, Carol burned
this place to the ground.

26:53.960 --> 26:55.996
We are planting
the seeds of a new dawn.

26:57.320 --> 26:59.072
Smitty? Clay Vanstone.

26:59.160 --> 27:00.275
No, I'm not dead. That was

27:00.360 --> 27:01.696
just a rumour,
although well-founded.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.440
How much alcohol
can I legally buy from you?

27:04.320 --> 27:05.639
(TYRES SCREECH)

27:09.640 --> 27:10.755
Move out of my way.

27:10.840 --> 27:13.115
I swear to God, I will drop
this on your back. Move!

27:13.320 --> 27:14.719
You know what?

27:14.800 --> 27:16.950
Merry Christmas,
you sweet motherfucker. Ah!

27:17.080 --> 27:18.176
- You're coming, yeah, Smitty?
- Yes.

27:18.200 --> 27:19.480
- Yes! Okay. You want this?
- No.

27:19.520 --> 27:20.589
All right.

27:25.320 --> 27:27.311
I'm keeping this lamb.

27:29.760 --> 27:30.829
We need something else,

27:30.960 --> 27:31.949
something that will
make us look cool.

27:31.960 --> 27:33.936
Does anybody know anybody
who knows the Kanye West?

27:33.960 --> 27:34.949
TRACEY AND JOSH: No.

27:34.960 --> 27:36.757
But my girlfriend
does P.R. for the Bulls.

27:36.960 --> 27:38.256
Okay, does your girlfriend
have a friend who knows

27:38.280 --> 27:39.952
the man that makes us
call him Yeezy?

27:40.000 --> 27:42.116
TIM: (CHUCKLING) Nate,
what's up, man? Did you see?

27:42.320 --> 27:44.834
Significant others are welcome
at the party. Look at that.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.176
Looks like we're finally
gonna meet Becca.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.349
Yeah!

27:47.600 --> 27:48.635
Um, oh, shoot.

27:48.760 --> 27:51.752
Uh, except she's working late
tonight. Modelling.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.313
Is she shooting the cover

27:53.400 --> 27:54.958
- of Full of Shit magazine?
- (LAUGHS)

27:55.320 --> 27:57.311
You know what?
She's gonna be there.

27:57.640 --> 28:00.108
You guys!
Nate's girlfriend's coming!

28:00.800 --> 28:03.394
NATE: Shit! Match, match,
match. Match! Come on.

28:05.960 --> 28:09.396
Okay. Um, what are we gonna do
with these after the party?

28:09.760 --> 28:10.829
Raffle.

28:19.920 --> 28:21.558
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

28:23.960 --> 28:26.997
For a failing branch,
we're surprisingly productive.

28:27.560 --> 28:29.551
Yeah, I just wish Carol
could see this.

28:29.760 --> 28:31.955
Uh, no, Clay,
that would be very bad.

28:32.120 --> 28:33.314
Yeah, you're right.

28:33.560 --> 28:34.776
All right,
go put on your party suits.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.880
- Yeah.
- Tonight's gonna be

28:35.960 --> 28:36.960
a great night.

28:45.840 --> 28:47.751
(RAP MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)

29:00.520 --> 29:01.555
JOSH: Clay, I told you,

29:01.640 --> 29:03.551
I don't need to do
any pre-game for...

29:04.200 --> 29:05.952
- Carol.
- Pre-game for what?

29:06.120 --> 29:08.759
For the, uh, work session
we got tonight.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.712
(STAMMERING)
And to complete...

29:10.800 --> 29:12.056
We're closing
Walter Davis, you know?

29:12.080 --> 29:13.280
It's going really,
really well.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.096
- Hmm. (CLEARS THROAT)
- Phase one's complete.

29:15.120 --> 29:16.348
Why don't you come on in?

29:16.520 --> 29:17.880
I thought you were
going to London.

29:17.960 --> 29:20.190
I was on my way
to the airport,

29:20.400 --> 29:22.118
but I thought
I would stop by and

29:22.640 --> 29:24.631
have a tour
of your bachelor pad.

29:26.960 --> 29:28.393
Well, that didn't take long.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.552
How did you know
about my divorce?

29:30.760 --> 29:33.320
Oh, you changed your
emergency contact to "self."

29:33.640 --> 29:34.755
And nobody single by choice

29:34.840 --> 29:36.096
would live this close
to the freeway.

29:36.120 --> 29:37.951
Is that robe
why your wife left you?

29:37.960 --> 29:39.109
What do you want, Carol?

29:39.200 --> 29:40.952
I want you to work for me
in New York.

29:40.960 --> 29:42.951
You basically run this branch
without the credit.

29:43.080 --> 29:45.389
I will double your salary,
you'll get job security,

29:45.840 --> 29:47.717
and a boss who doesn't
end every memo

29:47.800 --> 29:48.949
with a quote from Aerosmith.

29:49.520 --> 29:52.956
I could never do that to Clay,
and I'm very happy where I am.

29:53.320 --> 29:54.355
- Really?
- Yeah.

29:54.520 --> 29:55.953
I don't see happy.

29:56.960 --> 30:01.750
I see crappy.
And a rug that makes me sad.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.153
Anyway, um...

30:04.600 --> 30:05.715
I don't know,

30:05.800 --> 30:07.631
just think about it.
When the branch closes,

30:07.960 --> 30:10.952
and Clay has a trust fund
to fall back on,

30:11.320 --> 30:12.958
what are you gonna have?

30:13.560 --> 30:14.959
Not much.

What are you hoping to find
anyway, Carla?

30:38.960 --> 30:40.120
What's your dream contraband?

30:40.320 --> 30:41.958
I just like making you
my bitch.

30:41.960 --> 30:43.837
- You can go.
- (SCOFFS) Thank you.

if she joined the TSA.

take a look at this, please.

Ooh, who's Mr December?

30:53.160 --> 30:54.513
This is Walter Davis,
he's a VIP.

30:54.720 --> 30:56.176
I want you to do me a favour
and let me know the second

30:56.200 --> 30:57.360
he comes in. Can you do that?

30:57.600 --> 30:59.136
You will hear
the sound of heavy flirting.

30:59.160 --> 31:00.991
Or just a text.
That'd be great.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.553
And are you
gonna join us later?

31:02.640 --> 31:04.096
No, I doubt it. I have to
protect the front lines,

31:04.120 --> 31:05.633
make sure
no crazy stuff happens.

31:05.760 --> 31:07.955
But if it does...
(EXCLAIMS) I'm ready.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.752
And you went with the yellow.
Smart.

- How's everyone doing tonight?
- Great.

31:17.160 --> 31:18.798
- It's my birthday.
- Ah.

- Hey, there, Susan.

- Hey, Josh.
- Hey, Dean.

31:35.080 --> 31:36.800
You... You thought you'd bring
the kid, huh?

31:37.080 --> 31:39.275
Yeah. We couldn't get anyone
to watch him.

31:39.520 --> 31:40.953
But don't worry,
he has an iPad.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.336
We could axe murder each other
and he wouldn't even notice.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.590
He'll just sit there with
that dumb look on his face.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.393
Yeah, that's the one.

31:47.920 --> 31:50.912
Okay. Well, can you stick him
in my office for me?

31:50.960 --> 31:53.554
- If you're cool with that.
- Sure. Well, not cool, but...

31:53.760 --> 31:55.716
- Have a good time.
- Thank you.

31:56.600 --> 31:58.113

we can skip this, too.

a really great story

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.274

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.358
I was in the bathroom
washing my face,

01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:34.119
and this girl came in, like,

01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:36.589
"I'll give you a handy
for $40."

01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.955

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:41.919
my penis was in her hand
and then she starts...

01:03:42.640 --> 01:03:44.551
Okay, Larry, I know
how a hand job works.

01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:46.200

you guys were together.

talking about?

- Can I get a drink?

01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.188
Josh, where's Clay?

01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.960
Asswipe loses everybody
their jobs and runs.

01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.718
How much did he spend
on this party?

01:11:14.800 --> 01:11:15.949
He could have just given
that money to us.

01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:17.109
Clay sucks.

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:18.536

Sorry,
that was too much, but...

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.831
Clay cares more
about people

01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:27.188
than anyone I've ever met.

01:11:27.640 --> 01:11:29.153

your bonuses tonight

01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:30.360

Yeah, he's broke.
Clay is broke.

Who do you think paid

01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.112
for that bouncy house
in accounting?

to deliver the mail?

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:42.599
It was all Clay!

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:43.949
He spent all of his money

01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:45.798
trying to keep
this branch afloat.

01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.040
And whenever I questioned him
about it, he would say,

01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.396
"Treat your employees
like they're your family

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:52.040

for you."

Wait... Who's Becca?

01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:58.597
- Nate's whore.
- Hey, that's his girlfriend!

01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.279
Nope, she's right.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:02.193
Becca's a prostitute.

with a pimp?

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.950
Yes. She has a gun
and a serious mood imbalance.

01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:11.715

Clay has gone to get wasted
with a psychopath,

01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:22.555
and he's got $300,000
strapped to his chest.

01:12:22.920 --> 01:12:25.070
Ooh, that really does sound
like a big problem...

01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.589
For Clay.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:27.760
You already lost your dad.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.512

you'll have no one.

firing everyone?

- Comfortably.

with that incline,

you that in hacker college?

gets to keep their jobs?

01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:09.816
Everybody gets to
keep their jobs.

01:36:09.840 --> 01:36:10.955
Yes!

01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.116
God, I am gonna be CEO.

01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:15.118
Because you deserve it.

01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:17.950
And you throw
a great fucking party.

01:36:18.200 --> 01:36:20.316
Yeah. I did, didn't I?

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:22.958
- Oh! Walter.
- Walter.

01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:24.995

- Carol, nice to meet you.

01:36:27.400 --> 01:36:29.197
There's my eagle. Hey.

01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:33.116
I just want to thank you
for the best night of my life!

01:36:33.560 --> 01:36:34.754
- Yeah? Yeah?

01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.952
I'll see you on Monday.

01:36:39.720 --> 01:36:41.950
Well, it looks like
we just hired Walter Davis.

01:36:43.960 --> 01:36:45.757
Well, he'll fit right in.

01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.389
Wow.

01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:49.959

- What are you doing?
- Winner! (CHUCKLES)

01:36:54.960 --> 01:36:56.996
- We weren't racing.
- Well, you weren't.

01:36:57.400 --> 01:36:59.520
Why do you think they always
make you leave a hospital

01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:00.953
in a wheelchair?

01:37:01.960 --> 01:37:03.757
(ALL EXCLAIM HAPPILY)

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.113
What are you guys
doing here?

01:37:07.320 --> 01:37:09.000
Well, we can't
go to breakfast without you.

01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:11.320
- Come on, we're celebrating.
- JOSH: Come on, let's go.

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:14.918

- CAROL: Yes.

01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:28.176
- Oh.
- You left this in your room.

01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:29.952
Oh, I did.
Thank you. I'm sorry.

01:37:30.320 --> 01:37:31.753
And also this.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:34.554
Oh, thank you, Doctor. Here.

01:37:35.640 --> 01:37:36.709
No.

01:37:36.800 --> 01:37:38.096
- Wanna get out of here?
- Let's go.

01:37:38.120 --> 01:37:40.554
Oh, no. I'm not getting in
that. I ordered us an Uber.

01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:41.709
MARY: Carol?

01:37:41.800 --> 01:37:44.792
I don't mean this in a creepy
way, but get in the van.

01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:46.520
Yeah, we got to keep
this train rolling.

01:37:46.640 --> 01:37:47.755

- WOMEN: Yes.

01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:50.195
No! You cannot have alcohol

01:37:50.560 --> 01:37:52.118
Uh, fuck that.
Drinking is medication.

01:37:52.400 --> 01:37:54.200
Doctor, this is a...
This is a work breakfast.

01:37:54.280 --> 01:37:55.952
There will be
no alcohol at all.

01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.995
(MOUTHS) Okay?

01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:00.274
- Yeah.

01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:01.594
I saw that.

01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:03.950
Doctor, I assure you.
I am in charge.

01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.116
There will be
no more partying.

01:38:06.720 --> 01:38:07.755

I'm literally right here.

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.554
I just don't know what it is
you think that I'm not seeing.

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:16.957
Doctor, I would never disobey
medical advice. (MOUTHING)

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:19.954
Just go, just go.

01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:21.176
JOSH: It's an office thing.
Here we go.

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:22.336
- Merry Christmas.
- Let's go.

01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:23.759
JOSH: Let's roll it
to the car.

your service, Doctor.

Okay. (GRUNTS)

01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:31.949
Okay. You need any help
working your way out of here?

01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:34.315
Please, Josh.
I was born in a U-Haul.

- What? Uh, no.

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:48.831
Are you sure?
You look like a Carol.

01:38:50.560 --> 01:38:52.835
Can you not hear me? Carol!

01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:54.954

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.635
Let me do it again.

01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:37.136
Let me just do it again.
I can do it.

Oh, damn it. (LAUGHS)

01:39:39.560 --> 01:39:40.595

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:42.593
Shit, shit!

01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:46.720
If you want to make it

01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:47.915
learn to lie better.

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:50.073

JOSH: She's gonna suck
on this one, guys.

Guys, can we go back to one
for sucking my dick?

01:40:05.360 --> 01:40:06.976
I like it 'cause it looks
like he's trying

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.592
just a little too hard.

01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:09.789
The artist?

01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:11.592
I hadn't thought
about the artist.

01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:14.109
Was this not where
you had the key

01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:16.156

He used all of
his inheritance.

01:40:53.960 --> 01:40:55.359
It's a hard word to say.

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:59.952
To keep this branch afloat
with his in-her-i-tance.

01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:00.995

Andrew from the copy room
told me that he had mono.

01:41:32.320 --> 01:41:33.958
I said I wanted to get mono

01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:36.349
because I wanted to take
a month off from work.

01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:38.591
And I kissed him deeply.

01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:41.591
And I didn't get mono!
