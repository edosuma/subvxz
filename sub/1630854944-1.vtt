00:30.880 --> 00:32.560
(Kai Li over radio)
Saint Bay, do you copy?

00:32.600 --> 00:33.600
Come in, Saint Bay.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.560
Argo to Saint Bay station.

00:36.160 --> 00:38.160
Argo to Saint Bay station.
Come in, Saint Bay.

00:38.560 --> 00:40.735
(man over radio)
This is Saint Bay station. Come in, Argo.

00:40.760 --> 00:42.760
This is Kai Li Cain
from the Wayne expedition.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.560
We've found the Cobblepot base camp...

00:44.920 --> 00:46.480
or what's left of it.

00:46.840 --> 00:49.200
Mr. Wayne is with Grayson and Tawde
looking for survivors.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.040
Dick, Sanjay, report.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.960
It's bad, sir. Nothing but dead bodies.

01:06.400 --> 01:08.040
Yeah. Heaps of 'em.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.840
We found the ship's manifest, sir.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.840
We're still two short.
Someone named Grendon,

01:12.160 --> 01:13.320
and then Cobblepot himself.

01:15.160 --> 01:16.600
Not to go grummy, Mr. Wayne,

01:16.680 --> 01:18.960
but the odds of anyone
surviving out here...

01:21.800 --> 01:22.800
We keep looking.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.160
Professor Cobblepot's journal?

01:40.520 --> 01:41.920
(Cobblepot) 'Expedition day three.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.400
Men are on edge.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.720
The dogs will still not leave the ship.

01:47.080 --> 01:48.080
It's this place.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.400
They fear it.

01:51.680 --> 01:52.800
And I must confess...

01:53.760 --> 01:54.960
I don't blame them.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.000
Day seven...

01:57.640 --> 01:58.640
Things are worse.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.880
Could not calm the dogs.

02:01.600 --> 02:02.760
Forced to kill them all.

02:03.400 --> 02:04.640
Grendon has disappeared.

02:05.560 --> 02:07.000
Has gone mad, I fear.

02:07.640 --> 02:09.639
And the others, they won't speak.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.000
They refuse to even move.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.680
Day ten, just me now.

02:16.720 --> 02:18.080
When I close my eyes...

02:19.200 --> 02:20.480
I hear it calling.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.040
From the ice.'

02:23.800 --> 02:24.800
(Bruce) Cobblepot?

02:25.000 --> 02:27.280
(Cobblepot) 'It tells me it's coming.'

02:27.920 --> 02:30.000
(Bruce) Professor Cobblepot! Oswald!

02:31.520 --> 02:32.520
(screams)

02:33.680 --> 02:34.680
(groaning)

02:39.080 --> 02:40.240
(Cobblepot) 'It tells me...

02:42.040 --> 02:44.280
I have come home.'

03:02.160 --> 03:04.000
(ice clacking)

03:08.200 --> 03:09.960
(ice scraping)

03:12.320 --> 03:13.320
Cobblepot?

03:14.360 --> 03:15.920
(man) Cobblepot is no more.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.560
He's something else now.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.800
He's become
what he was always meant to be.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.240
I take it you're Grendon.

03:27.360 --> 03:30.080
(Grendon) Was Grendon. Once.

03:31.320 --> 03:33.200
Now I'm chosen by him

03:33.480 --> 03:35.520
to be his messenger to the world.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.400
I see. And who is 'him', exactly?

03:40.320 --> 03:45.280
Him is he who bays and slavers
forever outside time and space,

03:45.640 --> 03:47.880
who shambled down out of the stars

03:47.960 --> 03:52.720
when Earth new and spawned abominations
in the seas and blights upon the land.

03:53.240 --> 03:56.120
Woe to man when he comes again.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.840
(Bruce screams)

04:02.240 --> 04:05.560
(Grendon) To gaze upon his form
is to invite madness.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.640
That is why, in order to serve him,
I chose to make...

04:10.600 --> 04:11.960
adjustments.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.120
You're gonna come with me.

04:15.400 --> 04:16.399
Now!

04:16.519 --> 04:17.760
No. No!

04:18.320 --> 04:20.519
- I'm not finished yet.
- (creature screeching overhead)

04:24.880 --> 04:26.120
(grunting)

04:39.120 --> 04:40.520
(gasping)

04:46.000 --> 04:47.360
(grunting)

04:59.880 --> 05:01.360
(breath trembles)

05:09.080 --> 05:10.200
(groaning)

05:20.040 --> 05:21.720
- (creature screeching)
- (grunting)

05:31.840 --> 05:33.240
(Grendon yelling)

05:36.200 --> 05:37.280
(Grendon groans)

05:39.920 --> 05:40.920
Hark...

05:41.680 --> 05:43.400
The lurker is on the threshold.

05:44.640 --> 05:45.640
And behold...

05:46.560 --> 05:47.560
It...

05:47.640 --> 05:48.640
Is...

05:49.080 --> 05:50.080
Coming.

06:03.680 --> 06:04.840
(jazz music playing)

06:11.560 --> 06:13.160
(Bruce over radio) Shore party to Argo.

06:16.080 --> 06:17.280
This is Argo. Go ahead.

06:17.600 --> 06:19.680
Kai Li, ready the explosives.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.840
Uh, did you say explosives?

06:23.240 --> 06:25.200
I mean, sure, Mr. Wayne. How many?

06:25.520 --> 06:26.520
All of them.

06:39.440 --> 06:42.120
Whoo! Hot dog!

06:42.760 --> 06:45.160
Nothing'll get into or out of that cave
ever again.

06:46.320 --> 06:47.680
You sure sealing it off was wise?

06:48.600 --> 06:51.375
The scientific value of a prehistoric
creature like the one you described...

06:51.400 --> 06:53.320
Is far less than the danger it posed.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.760
That thing has infected
the surrounding wildlife here

06:56.840 --> 06:58.360
with some sort of mutational agent.

06:59.560 --> 07:01.840
A virus that must've lain dormant
for millennia.

07:02.840 --> 07:03.840
And it's quite possible,

07:03.960 --> 07:05.920
it infected some of
the Cobblepot party as well.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.400
(gasps)

07:08.880 --> 07:11.240
So, whatever that creature was, Dick,

07:11.480 --> 07:12.800
it was meant to stay buried.

07:17.360 --> 07:18.720
Sir, what about Cobblepot?

07:19.120 --> 07:20.120
Did you ever find him?

07:22.880 --> 07:24.000
(Bruce) Cobblepot's gone.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.080
(grunting)

07:50.160 --> 07:53.040
Heavens, what is that ghastly smell?

07:53.160 --> 07:54.960
That would be your friend, Grendon.

07:55.240 --> 07:58.280
Once we warmed him up,
he started to spoil.

07:58.360 --> 07:59.480
Spoil?

07:59.600 --> 08:01.400
The old palooka's dead as a donkey.

08:02.120 --> 08:03.120
Right, Dicky?

08:03.440 --> 08:05.455
The tissue samples I took from him
appear to be dead,

08:05.480 --> 08:07.800
- but I'm sure there's a logical...
- Logical explanation.

08:08.720 --> 08:11.680
You know, ace, you're starting to sound
more like the big cheese every day.

08:12.200 --> 08:16.480
May I ask where this rather loquacious
cadaver is, presently?

08:16.560 --> 08:18.840
Until Dick can whip up something
to keep the body frozen,

08:19.280 --> 08:20.760
Mr. Wayne had us put him on ice.

08:22.600 --> 08:25.640
He instructed me to put Mr. Grendon
in the meat freezer, Alfred.

08:29.080 --> 08:32.360
I do so look forward to fetching
this evening's roast.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.360
(Bruce) 'Though I am strayed,

08:45.360 --> 08:47.520
my Testament shall remain in Gotham.

08:48.400 --> 08:50.040
-Forever in my keep.'
-(door opens)

08:52.120 --> 08:55.200
Master Bruce, about this Grendon.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.840
- Perhaps it's time for another...
- Gotham is in danger.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.720
You gleaned that
from Cobblepot's journal, sir?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.000
I'm sure of it now.

09:02.520 --> 09:03.760
But from what you told me,

09:03.840 --> 09:05.600
the professor was not of sound mind.

09:05.960 --> 09:08.440
Believe me, Alfred,
I took that into consideration.

09:08.520 --> 09:12.280
Unhinged rantings aside, his journal
confirms much of what I've uncovered

09:12.360 --> 09:13.960
about the existence of an ancient cult.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.000
And if any of what he writes is true,

09:16.080 --> 09:18.840
it's a cult that has long ties to Gotham.

09:19.640 --> 09:21.480
Then should I take this to mean...

09:22.440 --> 09:24.280
It's been 20 years since we left, Alfred.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.680
Twenty years preparing.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.240
And now...

09:28.640 --> 09:29.640
It's time.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.040
We're going home.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.320
(horn bellows)

09:52.800 --> 09:54.600
How long you figure we'll be in Gotham?

09:55.480 --> 09:56.720
We're here for good, kid.

09:56.800 --> 09:58.080
(Kai Li) Horsefeathers!

09:58.160 --> 09:59.640
In the two years I've been with you

09:59.720 --> 10:02.280
we haven't stayed in any city
for more than a few weeks.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.000
Come to think of it...

10:04.320 --> 10:06.680
I've never stayed in any city
for more than a few weeks.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.280
I've been traveling with Bruce
coming on a decade now, Kai Li.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.360
And it's always been about returning
to Gotham.

10:11.520 --> 10:13.760
Okay, but returning for what?

10:13.920 --> 10:15.080
- (chuckles)
- (groans)

10:17.960 --> 10:18.960
(sinister chuckling)

10:21.320 --> 10:22.600
Doom.

10:23.360 --> 10:25.680
You return for your doom.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.280
Nuts to you, ya rank spud.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.160
It appears Gotham has become a bit more...

10:39.000 --> 10:40.880
Untended than we remember it.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.800
Let's hope
it's nothing like I remember it, Alfred.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.640
(Thomas) Gotham's history
is our history, son.

10:49.960 --> 10:51.360
Wayne family history.

10:52.160 --> 10:54.240
The Waynes built this city, Bruce.

10:54.600 --> 10:57.120
That makes you part of a long legacy.

10:57.840 --> 10:58.840
What's a legacy?

10:59.640 --> 11:03.840
It means, one day,
you'll have very big shoes to fill.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.360
Come now, Martha.

11:06.480 --> 11:09.360
It's more important a man learn
to stand on his own feet

11:09.480 --> 11:11.840
before cramming them
into someone else's shoes.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.120
Isn't that right, son?

11:15.680 --> 11:18.800
We have brought this curse upon us!

11:18.880 --> 11:20.400
(both grunting)

11:21.720 --> 11:22.720
Thomas!

11:23.040 --> 11:24.040
(groans)

11:27.600 --> 11:29.560
Bruce, run! Just... (groans)

11:33.360 --> 11:35.280
(laughs maniacally)

11:53.880 --> 11:55.120
(indistinct ominous whispering)

12:06.440 --> 12:07.440
(creatures screeching)

12:11.520 --> 12:12.680
Grendon's secure, sir.

12:12.960 --> 12:14.680
You sure you want us
to just leave him here?

12:14.760 --> 12:15.760
For now.

12:16.280 --> 12:18.040
If he was exposed to that virus...

12:18.880 --> 12:21.840
I don't trust the Gotham Police
to use the same precautions we have.

12:22.040 --> 12:23.040
Understood.

12:23.360 --> 12:25.760
But I'll need one of you to stay back
and keep an eye on him.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.040
(Kai Li) Tough luck, Sanjay.

12:36.400 --> 12:37.400
Damn it.

12:39.320 --> 12:40.320
Aye aye, Cap.

12:40.840 --> 12:41.640
And why not?

12:41.720 --> 12:45.280
After months at sea, what's a few
more days on this fine vessel?

12:45.520 --> 12:48.080
It'll give me a chance to cozy up
with the nutso diseased corpse.

12:48.720 --> 12:51.400
Hear that? Just you and me now, Mr. Zero.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.640
Lucius.

13:29.480 --> 13:30.480
So good to see you.

13:30.920 --> 13:32.000
You as well, son.

13:32.320 --> 13:34.440
Nice work, Alfred.
You brought him home in one piece.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.960
Not for his lack of trying, old friend.

13:38.880 --> 13:40.120
How's business, Lucius?

13:40.400 --> 13:41.400
Copacetic.

13:41.840 --> 13:43.000
So long as the board believes

13:43.040 --> 13:45.720
all executive directives
are coming from you, that is.

13:46.280 --> 13:47.080
For some reason,

13:47.160 --> 13:49.920
they just don't seem quite comfortable
taking orders from me.

13:50.280 --> 13:51.080
Well then,

13:51.160 --> 13:54.560
I guess you'll just have to continue
making sure that all my directives are...

13:55.040 --> 13:56.040
Copacetic.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.680
(laughs) I plan to.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.080
And you received my last consignment?

14:01.360 --> 14:03.080
Like all your shipments over the years,

14:03.160 --> 14:04.880
I had everything
situated in the wine cellar

14:05.000 --> 14:06.760
to your precise specifications.

14:07.520 --> 14:08.800
Thank you, Lucius.

14:11.640 --> 14:12.640
One thing...

14:12.720 --> 14:13.720
Wine cellar?

14:14.080 --> 14:15.320
Let's not romanticize it.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.080
It's a cave.

14:19.320 --> 14:22.200
(Kai Li) Whoa. Wow.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.320
Swanky.

14:27.960 --> 14:28.960
Master Bruce,

14:29.400 --> 14:31.560
it appears word of your return
has spread, sir.

14:32.040 --> 14:34.320
Oliver Queen has invited you
for dinner and drinks.

14:34.960 --> 14:37.400
I shall assume
he intends an emphasis on the latter.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.080
Master Bruce?

14:40.640 --> 14:42.520
Something isn't right.

14:42.760 --> 14:43.760
(Kai Li yells)

14:54.320 --> 14:55.320
Claw marks?

14:55.440 --> 14:56.720
It's some sort of animal attack.

14:57.160 --> 14:58.280
- A bear, maybe?
- No.

14:59.080 --> 15:00.720
The wounds are made bottom up.

15:01.040 --> 15:03.640
Ursine claws are incapable
of that kind of movement.

15:04.080 --> 15:04.880
This bruise...

15:05.040 --> 15:07.560
- Strangulation.
- Means whatever did this had thumbs.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.000
Obviously, he was killed elsewhere
and brought here.

15:10.320 --> 15:11.320
But why?

15:14.680 --> 15:15.680
I am...

15:16.360 --> 15:17.240
Langstrom.

15:17.360 --> 15:18.440
(gasps)

15:18.800 --> 15:19.800
Bruce, what is it?

15:22.280 --> 15:23.280
Did you...

15:23.600 --> 15:25.440
Ah. Nevermind.

15:25.760 --> 15:26.920
Should we notify the police?

15:27.320 --> 15:28.320
Yes.

15:28.520 --> 15:29.600
But, not yet.

15:30.960 --> 15:31.960
I'll handle it.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.560
(Alfred) Are you sure
you're up for dinner, sir?

15:40.880 --> 15:42.960
(Bruce) This house
has been sealed for 20 years

15:43.080 --> 15:46.040
and the corpse downstairs
isn't doing the fustiness any favors.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.880
At the very least,
we could stand the fresh air.

15:49.360 --> 15:52.640
Besides, I haven't seen
Oliver since we ran into each other in...

15:55.400 --> 15:56.400
Dushanbe.

15:58.840 --> 16:00.200
My name is Blood.

16:00.520 --> 16:02.960
You do not want to know me or what I am.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.120
Suffice it to say,

16:08.400 --> 16:10.640
what is invisible to most
is visible to me.

16:11.640 --> 16:12.480
Is that so?

16:12.560 --> 16:14.400
June 26th, 1908.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.240
You witnessed your parents' murder.

16:16.360 --> 16:18.440
In the ensuing years,
you set upon the world,

16:18.600 --> 16:22.120
absorbing all forms of criminology,
psychology, martial art...

16:22.480 --> 16:26.560
Whatever skills you deemed necessary
to one day avenge your parents' deaths

16:26.840 --> 16:28.400
and become this city's savior.

16:28.920 --> 16:29.920
The Bat.

16:30.320 --> 16:32.520
Do you have a point, Mr. Blood?

16:32.640 --> 16:35.920
Your homecoming has set certain wheels
in motion, Bruce Wayne.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.360
And though I know much,

16:37.720 --> 16:40.840
I'm only allowed
to tell you these things three.

16:41.280 --> 16:42.080
One.

16:42.160 --> 16:44.360
You must seek out two spirits.

16:44.640 --> 16:45.640
(laughs)

16:46.280 --> 16:47.280
Spirits?

16:47.520 --> 16:50.120
One wrapped in bats, the other in flames.

16:50.720 --> 16:51.520
Two.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.840
To prevail in this, Bruce Wayne must die

16:53.920 --> 16:56.000
and through death become himself.

16:56.880 --> 16:57.880
Three.

16:58.360 --> 16:59.720
Before it can be saved,

17:00.120 --> 17:00.920
Gotham...

17:01.000 --> 17:03.080
must be burned to the ground.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.880
Listen, I'm not sure what your game is,

17:06.960 --> 17:08.480
but I'm not big on ghost stories.

17:08.760 --> 17:11.319
Your dubiety will be your undoing.

17:12.839 --> 17:13.839
(grunts)

17:14.280 --> 17:16.000
You wanna talk undoing?

17:18.920 --> 17:20.160
(Bruce groans)

17:21.400 --> 17:25.200
You'll find no enemy here,
my thickheaded friend.

17:25.280 --> 17:28.079
Rest assured when you face your foe,

17:28.160 --> 17:30.360
you'll see me again.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.640
I've readied the car for...

17:44.880 --> 17:45.880
dinner.

17:49.600 --> 17:54.360
And then Bruce says to the man,
'Sorry constable, it was dog fur.'

17:55.600 --> 17:56.600
(laughing)

17:58.840 --> 17:59.840
(laughs)

18:00.480 --> 18:02.640
That's not quite how it went, Ollie.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.160
Oh, come on, Brucey, you gotta embellish.

18:05.240 --> 18:07.200
It's called showmanship. Right, Kelley?

18:08.480 --> 18:09.680
It's Kai Li.

18:09.920 --> 18:10.920
Attagirl.

18:11.640 --> 18:15.240
Oh. I hear you ran into one
of Gotham's finest down south.

18:17.600 --> 18:18.800
Easy, fellas.

18:18.880 --> 18:22.880
Old Cobblepot was mad as a march hare
well before his expedition.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.880
So, Mr. Queen,
I notice you're into hunting.

18:27.320 --> 18:30.040
It's a passion that's taken me
around the world.

18:31.240 --> 18:35.840
Not a matter of flora nor fauna alive,
that can best Oliver Queen.

18:36.120 --> 18:38.600
You do know flora are plants, right?

18:39.960 --> 18:40.960
Of course.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.400
And I stand by my assertion.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.400
- For what plant could...
- (doorbell dings)

18:47.200 --> 18:49.280
Oh, bully! My surprise guest.

18:49.840 --> 18:51.840
One of Bruce and my oldest chums

18:52.000 --> 18:56.800
and the man who will single-handedly
clean the fetid streets of our lost city,

18:56.960 --> 18:59.920
I give you Gotham's future mayor,
Harvey Dent.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.760
Let's not count chickens, Ollie.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.520
Election's not for four days and...

19:06.000 --> 19:07.600
I'll be...

19:07.960 --> 19:09.000
Bruce Wayne.

19:09.320 --> 19:10.320
Look at you, kid.

19:10.520 --> 19:12.720
Good to see you, Harvey.
It's been too long.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.120
And look at us three. Together again.

19:18.960 --> 19:19.760
So...

19:19.960 --> 19:21.080
You gonna offer me a drink,

19:21.600 --> 19:22.600
or not?

19:27.120 --> 19:28.320
(telephone ringing)

19:31.640 --> 19:32.640
Wayne residence.

19:34.360 --> 19:35.880
Mr. Wayne is out for the evening.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.440
- Is there a message I could...
- (line disconnects)

19:39.680 --> 19:43.520
So then, Harv,
I look this dewdropper square in his eyes.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.640
And I say, 'Sorry constable,

19:48.720 --> 19:50.360
it was duck fur.'

19:50.840 --> 19:52.120
(laughing)

19:57.120 --> 19:58.200
Tell me something, Harv.

19:58.960 --> 20:01.280
Does the name 'Langstrom'
mean anything to you?

20:01.680 --> 20:02.840
Professor Kirk Langstrom?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.080
The Batman of crime alley?

20:06.480 --> 20:08.200
He's loonier than Cobblepot.

20:09.120 --> 20:10.120
Come to think of it,

20:10.760 --> 20:13.280
there has been an uptick
in crackpots lately,

20:13.360 --> 20:15.080
which is saying something.

20:15.880 --> 20:19.120
Gotham's always had more
than our fair share of wingnuts.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.600
Langstrom is a biologist
at the university.

20:21.880 --> 20:23.200
A chiropterologist, actually.

20:23.400 --> 20:25.960
Of late,
he's rather infamously developed an

20:26.280 --> 20:29.440
unhealthy obsession with the bats
he studies.

20:29.680 --> 20:30.800
Unhealthy how?

20:31.000 --> 20:32.240
He claims to be one.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.080
Would you have an address for him?

20:38.520 --> 20:40.800
Somewhere in Robin's Row.
I'll call the office.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.320
Speaking of the office, gentlemen,

20:44.920 --> 20:46.680
I have to report to it in six hours.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.800
You'll have to show me how to do
that coin trick next time, Mr. Dent.

20:51.160 --> 20:52.160
Sorry, sport.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.200
Magicians don't spill.

21:01.280 --> 21:02.600
We'd best retire as well.

21:03.800 --> 21:05.400
- Say, Ollie...
- Huh?

21:06.160 --> 21:08.160
Since Alfred's still airing out the house,

21:08.520 --> 21:10.200
would you mind putting us up
for the night?

21:10.640 --> 21:12.560
Mind? I'll ring for more sherry.

21:15.960 --> 21:16.960
Keep an eye on Oliver.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.440
I'm beginning to think
Sanjay drew the lucky straw.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.040
(Grendon) First, I thought I failed.

21:31.000 --> 21:36.000
But I feel the power of his cold gift
inside me.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.080
(grumbles)

21:37.240 --> 21:38.240
Shut your yap...

21:38.320 --> 21:39.320
Ow!

21:43.680 --> 21:44.800
(sinister chuckling)

21:45.400 --> 21:47.480
Just dummy up, would ya?

21:48.960 --> 21:50.080
Everybody!

21:51.080 --> 21:52.920
(singing) Ida

21:53.120 --> 21:56.440
Sweet as apple cider

21:57.520 --> 22:00.680
Sweeter than all I know

22:01.120 --> 22:02.320
Come out

22:02.840 --> 22:06.320
In the silvery moonlight...

22:06.800 --> 22:08.120
Where's Bruce?

22:08.400 --> 22:10.800
If he's smart, back in Antarctica.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.120
Low, low, low, low, low

22:13.840 --> 22:14.840
Everybody!

22:40.800 --> 22:42.720
(officer) Landlady said
it sounded like a murder.

22:43.040 --> 22:44.160
I don't see no bodies.

22:44.440 --> 22:45.880
You look for bodies, junior.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.520
Screwballs like Langstrom,

22:47.920 --> 22:49.880
always keep some dough squirreled away.

22:50.080 --> 22:52.480
Hurry up and find it, will ya?
Before Gordon gets back...

22:52.800 --> 22:53.800
Jumped up jimminy!

22:56.200 --> 22:58.400
Find what you were looking for?

22:59.000 --> 23:00.360
Ventilate this son of a bitch.

23:01.840 --> 23:04.120
(groaning)

23:04.200 --> 23:05.200
(shuddering)

23:06.880 --> 23:07.960
(groans)

23:25.200 --> 23:26.240
Langstrom...

23:27.040 --> 23:28.560
The hell were you into?

23:50.960 --> 23:53.920
Okay, boys. Let's wrap the...

23:55.680 --> 23:56.680
What the...

23:58.880 --> 24:00.000
(telephone ringing)

24:02.640 --> 24:03.640
Wayne residence.

24:05.800 --> 24:08.240
As I've stated thrice already,
Ms. Barbara,

24:08.520 --> 24:10.080
Mr. Wayne is out for the evening.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.600
- Now, I will certainly deliver...
- (line disconnects)

24:14.560 --> 24:16.040
(Langstrom) 'If you're reading this,

24:16.280 --> 24:19.240
I, Dr. Kirk Langstrom, am dead.

24:19.960 --> 24:20.960
Thankfully.

24:21.200 --> 24:25.240
For a great doom is coming to this world.

24:26.600 --> 24:30.240
Though you will think me mad,
believe me, if you can.

24:30.800 --> 24:33.240
The bats speak to me.

24:35.160 --> 24:39.400
They see beyond what man dare fathom.

24:40.560 --> 24:41.920
And they tell me

24:42.360 --> 24:44.640
of a growing horror.

24:45.000 --> 24:50.120
A thing, crouching,
at the doorstep of our reality.

24:50.480 --> 24:52.640
And it is hungry for us.

24:53.040 --> 24:56.720
And it wants our world.

24:58.200 --> 25:03.120
For centuries, acolytes of this evil,
the 'Cult of Ghul'

25:03.680 --> 25:09.880
have endeavored to unlock the very door
that keeps the thing from our reality.

25:10.400 --> 25:12.760
And now, their time

25:13.680 --> 25:14.760
is nigh.

25:16.000 --> 25:19.480
Yet, there is still a single hope.

25:19.960 --> 25:21.600
They require a book,

25:21.680 --> 25:23.720
The Testament of Ghul.

25:23.920 --> 25:27.040
For only with the knowledge
contained in its pages

25:27.200 --> 25:29.920
may they open that door.

25:31.600 --> 25:37.200
The Testament must be kept from them,
at all costs.'

25:39.560 --> 25:40.680
Testament.

25:41.040 --> 25:43.640
'My Testament shall remain in Gotham.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.320
Forever in my keep.'

25:47.400 --> 25:48.560
Cobblepot had it.

26:11.640 --> 26:12.920
(telephone ringing)

26:15.240 --> 26:17.720
University repository.
Professor Manfurd speaking.

26:17.840 --> 26:20.760
(man) Do you have keep
of Professor Cobblepot's records?

26:20.880 --> 26:22.920
While he's on sabbatical, yes.
Who is this, please?

26:23.160 --> 26:25.000
The Testament of Ghul...

26:25.680 --> 26:27.120
I need it.

26:27.560 --> 26:28.560
Testament of...

26:29.040 --> 26:31.040
No, I am not familiar with such a text.

26:31.400 --> 26:33.440
Of course,
this is not a lending library, sir.

26:33.520 --> 26:35.000
This is the university repository

26:35.240 --> 26:37.521
- restricted to the public, if you...
- (line disconnects)

27:00.120 --> 27:02.240
Cobblepot ordered me to destroy you.

27:03.720 --> 27:05.840
Oh, but even if I could, I would not.

27:05.920 --> 27:09.640
I, for one, am so very glad at that.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.760
Talia? But how?

27:12.920 --> 27:14.120
You know who I am.

27:14.560 --> 27:15.560
Good.

27:16.040 --> 27:17.800
Please, don't kill me!

27:18.680 --> 27:20.760
We'll leave that business to...

27:22.520 --> 27:23.520
Daitya.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.200
No!

27:27.240 --> 27:28.240
(groaning)

27:34.960 --> 27:35.960
(gasps)

27:38.680 --> 27:40.720
The Testament. Now!

27:41.680 --> 27:43.440
(scoffs) No.

27:43.880 --> 27:45.280
Do as you will, Daitya.

27:49.440 --> 27:50.440
What the...

27:50.720 --> 27:51.720
(roars)

27:55.880 --> 27:57.040
(Batman groans)

27:59.120 --> 28:00.840
(roaring)

29:05.000 --> 29:06.160
Etrigan.

29:06.920 --> 29:09.640
You were told you know not what you face.

29:09.720 --> 29:13.000
Yet only you can stop it,
so leave this place.

29:15.920 --> 29:16.920
(both grunting)

29:17.040 --> 29:20.480
My sacrifice is made
so you might end this curse.

29:20.560 --> 29:24.880
Alas, it'd be for naught
should the book remain hers!

29:36.360 --> 29:37.560
(Batman) Let's try this again.

29:40.840 --> 29:42.760
The book. Now.

29:43.600 --> 29:46.680
Do not think your costume
can frighten me, Bat.

29:46.920 --> 29:51.760
I am well acquainted with real matter
of demon, Djinn and devil.

29:52.120 --> 29:56.160
Whatever the Cult of Ghul is planning,
it ends here.

29:56.600 --> 29:59.160
The Cult of Ghul perished centuries ago.

29:59.240 --> 30:00.560
I am its last...

30:00.840 --> 30:01.840
For now.

30:02.120 --> 30:03.120
(groans)

30:05.760 --> 30:08.320
After leaving you that surprise
in your study,

30:08.880 --> 30:10.880
I was certain, you'd realize

30:10.960 --> 30:12.720
I was not one to be trifled with.

30:13.840 --> 30:15.840
You knew I'd lead you to The Testament.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.400
You killed Langstrom. (groans)

30:18.600 --> 30:21.880
You have no clue
the power this book possesses.

30:21.960 --> 30:26.680
I know those who seek it
mean to do this city harm.

30:27.280 --> 30:28.680
Quite the contrary.

30:28.960 --> 30:33.520
We mean to give this city purpose
and honor the damnation which bore it.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.320
You, on the other hand,

30:35.400 --> 30:37.200
we mean to do harm.

30:42.520 --> 30:43.600
It can't be.

30:43.880 --> 30:45.400
Another monster.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.240
(grunting)

30:54.960 --> 30:56.400
(roaring)

30:59.000 --> 31:01.120
You don't go 812 years

31:01.280 --> 31:04.280
without making your share
of interesting friends.

31:15.320 --> 31:16.720
(groaning)

31:23.080 --> 31:24.120
(Batman grunts)

31:34.040 --> 31:35.040
(horn blows)

31:42.840 --> 31:43.880
(Batman panting)

31:46.400 --> 31:47.920
(groaning)

31:59.720 --> 32:01.120
The bat still lives.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.440
Mm. No matter.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.360
He poses no serious threat to us.

32:07.480 --> 32:10.200
Besides, you are needed
for another errand.

32:10.640 --> 32:12.760
The key has been delivered to the harbor.

32:13.680 --> 32:14.680
Retrieve it.

32:18.040 --> 32:19.040
(snoring)

32:25.240 --> 32:26.800
To think, in our letters to each other,

32:26.840 --> 32:30.840
I used to rib Bruce for collecting
a stray ragamuffin at every port.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.040
But you two...

32:33.640 --> 32:35.760
You two are on the level.

32:36.440 --> 32:40.080
Of course, you can do no better
than Bruce Wayne.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.200
Bruce.

32:45.120 --> 32:46.200
I owe the man.

32:46.920 --> 32:48.200
(sobbing)

32:49.880 --> 32:52.880
Lord, I owe him
more than he could possibly know.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.360
I'm so sorry, Brucey...

32:56.240 --> 32:58.280
So sorry.

32:59.400 --> 33:00.520
All right, easy there.

33:00.720 --> 33:02.200
I'm sure everything is fine, sir.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.920
Mr. Wayne isn't one to hold a grudge
against a good man.

33:06.280 --> 33:07.800
Come on, let's get some sleep.

33:08.400 --> 33:10.680
Am I though? A good man?

33:13.640 --> 33:14.680
Never forget,

33:15.560 --> 33:18.520
the sins of the father
are heaped upon the son.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.360
Thanks, Mr. Queen. Good to know.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.200
(yawns)

33:40.560 --> 33:41.560
Alfred.

33:41.960 --> 33:42.960
Master Bruce.

33:43.200 --> 33:44.040
What's happened?

33:44.120 --> 33:45.880
Not sure. Yet.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.760
(sniffs) Is that sulfur?

33:48.960 --> 33:50.360
You're wounded. I have to clean...

33:50.440 --> 33:53.400
Not yet. I have to analyze this substance.

33:53.840 --> 33:56.200
For when I run into
the mutated creature again.

33:56.800 --> 33:57.960
Mutated creature?

33:58.120 --> 33:59.480
Wait, where are you off to?

34:00.040 --> 34:02.080
The cave. We have work to do.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.320
It's a wine cellar, Master Bruce.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.000
We're not Neanderthals

34:10.679 --> 34:11.679
Boys...

34:12.400 --> 34:13.679
It is still June, isn't it?

34:13.760 --> 34:14.760
(horn blares)

34:20.239 --> 34:22.159
Hold up, kid. Ship's off limits.

34:22.840 --> 34:23.840
Heya, boys.

34:24.280 --> 34:25.800
Oliver Queen.

34:25.960 --> 34:27.159
What are you doing here?

34:27.679 --> 34:31.080
Expecting another dozen cases
of your bootleg hooch, are we?

34:31.320 --> 34:32.679
And flout the prohibition laws

34:32.760 --> 34:36.560
that help keep Gotham the fine
and chaste city we've all come to love?

34:37.120 --> 34:38.960
Why, Jimmy Gordon, you slay me!

34:39.760 --> 34:40.760
Tell you what though,

34:40.880 --> 34:44.120
if I do happen upon a case,
I'll let you watch me polish it off.

34:44.440 --> 34:45.895
At least then, you and your boys can see

34:45.920 --> 34:48.159
what getting to the bottom
of a case actually looks like.

34:48.639 --> 34:50.960
Get off it, Queen! Now listen, son...

34:52.159 --> 34:53.159
(engine starts)

34:56.159 --> 34:57.160
Go, go!

35:17.280 --> 35:18.520
(shudders)

35:20.440 --> 35:21.440
Sanjay?

35:22.760 --> 35:23.760
Sanjay?

35:26.720 --> 35:28.120
Jay? (gasps)

35:29.640 --> 35:30.640
(sighs)

35:31.880 --> 35:32.680
Sanjay...

35:32.800 --> 35:33.800
(Grendon laughing)

35:46.760 --> 35:48.800
(Oliver) I'd wise up if I were you, Jimmy.

35:48.960 --> 35:50.280
The election's in three days.

35:50.640 --> 35:54.200
If all goes pepper, my best chum,
Harvey Dent, will be your boss.

35:54.600 --> 35:56.160
- Think about the future...
- (gunshots)

35:56.800 --> 35:57.800
(screaming in distance)

36:02.280 --> 36:03.280
(gasps)

36:04.120 --> 36:05.120
Mercy.

36:15.920 --> 36:17.600
Come on. Let me through.

36:18.280 --> 36:19.600
Chief wants us to keep you...

36:32.080 --> 36:33.000
No!

36:33.080 --> 36:35.000
- No! No, it's okay!
- No!

36:35.080 --> 36:36.560
- No!
- It's okay.

36:36.640 --> 36:39.000
(sobbing) No! No!

36:40.480 --> 36:42.600
I've got you. I've got you. I know.

36:42.880 --> 36:45.000
I know. I know, let it out.

36:45.720 --> 36:46.880
It's okay, let it out.

36:50.160 --> 36:51.760
What did this?

36:53.800 --> 36:54.920
I don't know, Kai Li.

36:56.000 --> 36:57.520
But by the Lord's hand...

36:59.320 --> 37:00.880
they will pay.

37:03.400 --> 37:04.600
Millennia ago,

37:05.560 --> 37:09.800
you descended upon these wicked grounds
to learn secrets unholy.

37:11.360 --> 37:16.520
Now, I shall use those very secrets
to give you life again.

37:16.920 --> 37:21.920
Then, together, we will usher
Iog-Sotha into this reality!

37:24.600 --> 37:25.600
Daitya!

37:25.880 --> 37:27.400
You come in good time.

37:28.360 --> 37:29.920
Etrigan...

37:30.240 --> 37:31.240
Indeed.

37:32.000 --> 37:36.200
I furnished a demon to take your place
in your bottle prison, Djinn.

37:36.760 --> 37:41.600
Now, you must honor your end
of our bargain before returning to Hell.

37:42.200 --> 37:45.840
Scorch this cursed ground
with your wretched hellfire.

38:10.440 --> 38:12.040
(chanting incantation)

38:15.760 --> 38:16.800
Come forth!

38:30.480 --> 38:32.120
My daughter...

38:32.840 --> 38:34.000
(laughs)

38:34.400 --> 38:35.400
He has risen.

38:37.120 --> 38:39.360
Ra's al Ghul has risen!

38:51.920 --> 38:54.160
(Bruce) There are miles
of tunnel below this city.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.320
Talia is down here somewhere.

38:58.520 --> 39:00.120
The book you requested, sir.

39:02.400 --> 39:06.160
I would certainly never count myself
among the 'believers', Master Bruce.

39:06.640 --> 39:11.520
But I have seen enough in my time
to at least be wary of the dark arts.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.400
I appreciate the concern,
but we don't have time for superstitions.

39:14.800 --> 39:15.800
I only mean,

39:15.920 --> 39:19.680
perhaps it would be wise
to not discount such things out of hand.

39:19.760 --> 39:22.760
I'll admit a lot of what I've seen
seems to defy logic.

39:23.280 --> 39:24.080
But I assure you

39:24.160 --> 39:26.640
there's a rational explanation
behind all of it.

39:27.320 --> 39:28.320
What's this?

39:28.560 --> 39:30.480
(Alfred) 'The mausoleum of the serpent?'

39:31.000 --> 39:32.880
'Before humans, there were serpents.

39:33.480 --> 39:35.560
Masters of an ancient black magic.

39:36.360 --> 39:41.480
In what would be 2000 BC,
a dark priest, Ra's al Ghul,

39:41.560 --> 39:44.040
uncovered the ruins
of their unholy grounds.

39:44.400 --> 39:47.640
Using necromantic arts,
he wrested their secrets from them...

39:48.320 --> 39:50.960
The nature of the cosmos was his to wield.

39:51.800 --> 39:55.160
Yet, Ra's' one true desire
was to serve his master...

39:56.080 --> 39:57.520
Iog-Sotha.

39:58.240 --> 40:02.360
And to bring his dark
outer God into our reality.'

40:04.240 --> 40:05.280
Outer gods?

40:05.640 --> 40:07.040
All myth, Alfred.

40:07.320 --> 40:08.920
Then of what use is this to us?

40:09.240 --> 40:11.200
(Bruce) If you look
at any myth hard enough,

40:11.280 --> 40:13.200
you'll find the remnants
of fact underneath.

40:16.480 --> 40:17.480
Aklo.

40:18.440 --> 40:19.520
I'm sorry, sir...

40:20.040 --> 40:21.120
Aklo?

40:21.200 --> 40:22.560
The tick marks in that etching.

40:23.040 --> 40:25.040
It's an ancient system of writing...

40:25.120 --> 40:26.120
Aklo.

40:26.200 --> 40:27.200
They're not ticks.

40:28.040 --> 40:29.040
They're coordinates.

40:29.320 --> 40:30.320
Facts.

40:30.920 --> 40:31.920
Is it possible?

40:32.600 --> 40:35.520
This mausoleum is located
somewhere beneath Gotham?

40:35.680 --> 40:36.760
I'm going to find out.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.160
Check to see if our compound is ready.

40:43.680 --> 40:49.080
For a million, million years,
Iog-Sotha has longed for this planet.

40:49.480 --> 40:53.760
He howls and scrapes
at a door he can never open.

40:54.760 --> 40:59.400
Now, we shall descend
into the unholy chamber of the serpents

40:59.760 --> 41:03.400
and invoke the ceremony
that will show us this door.

41:09.760 --> 41:12.560
(Talia) You can't open a door
without a key.

41:17.760 --> 41:18.760
(telephone ringing)

41:22.240 --> 41:24.200
Oh, heavens, not again.

41:26.800 --> 41:29.800
Wayne residence and I assure you,
Mr. Wayne is still...

41:30.960 --> 41:33.560
Oh. Chief Gordon. My apologies, sir.

41:33.680 --> 41:34.680
I thought it was your...

41:34.960 --> 41:36.680
I thought it was a wrong number.

41:38.840 --> 41:39.840
My Lord...

41:41.200 --> 41:42.320
Yes, of course.

41:42.800 --> 41:45.600
If Mr. Queen could look after Kai Li
for the time being,

41:46.840 --> 41:48.400
it would be most appreciated.

41:48.800 --> 41:50.640
And the moment he returns, I...

41:51.520 --> 41:53.000
I shall inform Mr. Wayne.

41:58.000 --> 41:59.520
(Ra's al Ghul) O thou Gog,

42:02.280 --> 42:03.560
O thou Gog,

42:08.680 --> 42:12.840
O Kore... O Persephone...

42:13.880 --> 42:17.600
O Amaga, Iog-Sotha,

42:18.120 --> 42:20.480
Darkness out of time,

42:21.200 --> 42:22.600
show us your door

42:22.920 --> 42:24.400
so that we may partake

42:25.080 --> 42:28.600
in this holy purpose and finally...

42:36.200 --> 42:38.720
What manner of insolent worm is this?

42:39.000 --> 42:40.960
Continue the incantation, Father.

42:41.640 --> 42:44.600
We will deal with the interloper.

42:50.040 --> 42:51.040
(growling)

43:00.440 --> 43:01.960
(groaning, roaring)

43:13.080 --> 43:14.520
(Talia) You destroyed him.

43:15.200 --> 43:16.960
What magic is this?

43:17.600 --> 43:18.640
Not magic.

43:19.200 --> 43:20.960
Chlorine concentrate.

43:21.640 --> 43:22.640
Very well.

43:28.440 --> 43:31.400
My, you are a quick study.

43:31.920 --> 43:34.480
I suppose
I'll have to dispose of you intimately.

43:35.120 --> 43:36.320
- (grunts)
- (groans)

43:40.840 --> 43:42.240
(Ra's resumes chanting)

43:51.760 --> 43:52.760
(grunts)

44:00.160 --> 44:01.800
Etrigan...

44:03.400 --> 44:04.400
(Talia groans)

44:06.040 --> 44:07.960
That's enough, Ra's.

44:08.640 --> 44:11.680
Whoever you really are
and whatever your game is,

44:12.560 --> 44:13.560
it's over.

44:14.200 --> 44:15.200
(chuckling)

44:16.720 --> 44:17.720
Indeed,

44:18.280 --> 44:19.480
it is over...

44:19.640 --> 44:21.040
(rumbling)

44:23.320 --> 44:24.600
Over for you.

44:27.480 --> 44:29.240
(Talia) The ritual is complete.

44:35.720 --> 44:36.520
(hissing)

44:36.600 --> 44:39.240
(Ra's al Ghul) Reptiles once
ruled this earth.

44:39.320 --> 44:43.400
And now, they return with a plague
that will lead us to the door.

44:44.600 --> 44:46.120
To Iog-Sotha!

44:46.520 --> 44:47.520
(Ra's al Ghul laughing)

44:51.680 --> 44:52.720
(Batman screams)

45:13.000 --> 45:14.240
- (hissing)
- (people screaming)

45:19.440 --> 45:21.520
Extra, extra! Gotham knee-deep in lizards!

45:23.040 --> 45:24.040
(siren blaring)

45:24.120 --> 45:24.920
(people clapping)

45:25.000 --> 45:26.400
(Harvey) Thank you. Thank you.

45:27.560 --> 45:30.920
When elected, this infestation
will be my first priority.

45:31.440 --> 45:35.400
I refuse to let this be another scar
on the face of our proud, beautiful city.

45:35.480 --> 45:36.480
(man) Yes, Harvey!

45:36.560 --> 45:38.200
- I say enough!
- (people cheering)

45:44.960 --> 45:46.000
(Batman exhales)

45:49.960 --> 45:50.960
(groans)

45:55.120 --> 45:56.360
(people screaming)

45:58.280 --> 45:59.280
(grunts)

46:14.440 --> 46:15.440
(panting)

46:17.440 --> 46:19.040
(gasping)

46:19.840 --> 46:22.160
(distorted voice) The thing is coming.

46:22.640 --> 46:25.640
Today we will only show you...

46:25.720 --> 46:28.240
Show you the shape of the thing.

46:28.680 --> 46:30.240
For to gaze upon it

46:30.720 --> 46:32.640
is to invite madness!

46:34.680 --> 46:38.440
And though your mind may force itself
to forget what it sees,

46:39.240 --> 46:42.360
the mark of madness it leaves behind

46:42.760 --> 46:45.680
is yours for eternity.

46:46.080 --> 46:49.680
The only thing that can stop it
is the Bat.

46:50.480 --> 46:52.920
The only thing that can stop it...

46:53.520 --> 46:54.600
(screaming)

46:55.560 --> 46:57.240
is you!

46:57.800 --> 47:00.200
(Batman) I... remember.

47:02.960 --> 47:04.000
(bell tolling)

47:15.560 --> 47:16.560
Father?

47:24.080 --> 47:26.600
(newsreader)
And this just in, it's official,

47:26.800 --> 47:28.440
Harvey Dent is our next mayor!

47:28.600 --> 47:32.320
And in light of the sudden and miraculous
disappearance of the still-inexplicable

47:32.400 --> 47:36.040
reptile infestation, one has to believe
that his victory is a sign

47:36.120 --> 47:39.920
that Harvey Dent is, indeed,
our city's gateway to hope.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.415
(Harvey) We've endured so much together.

47:41.440 --> 47:44.560
As Mayor, I promise
this will be a shining new era for Gotham.

47:46.440 --> 47:48.200
Iog-Sotha has spoken.

47:48.800 --> 47:50.280
Dent is the door.

47:50.800 --> 47:53.600
Then all that remains
is to retrieve the key.

47:55.280 --> 47:59.480
- Masters, I told you. I know of no key.
- (Ra's al Ghul) Imbecile.

47:59.960 --> 48:04.200
You found Yib Nogeroth,
son of Iog-Sotha, in the ice.

48:04.640 --> 48:08.200
Though he sleeps,
he carried out his father's will...

48:09.280 --> 48:12.120
and planted his seed in you.

48:13.560 --> 48:16.080
Of course, the gift within me.

48:16.520 --> 48:17.840
This is the key!

48:18.400 --> 48:19.840
Tell me, how may I give... (screams)

48:29.080 --> 48:30.520
(groaning)

48:43.040 --> 48:44.520
Iog-Sotha,

48:45.280 --> 48:48.000
make this gift a new vessel.

48:48.880 --> 48:50.920
The agent of your delivery.

48:52.640 --> 48:53.640
Dent.

48:57.960 --> 48:58.960
(Batman) Doom...

49:00.600 --> 49:01.600
Doom...

49:02.880 --> 49:06.320
The great doom is coming.
It's at the doorstep.

49:07.400 --> 49:09.040
He hasn't moved from this spot,

49:09.520 --> 49:11.680
nor so much as spoken to me
since I found him.

49:11.800 --> 49:14.400
Not even after you told him
about misters Tawde and Grayson?

49:15.200 --> 49:16.920
Particularly after, I'm afraid.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.000
Alfred,

49:18.200 --> 49:19.200
it's time to call Hugo.

49:19.720 --> 49:21.000
The staff at Arkham can help.

49:37.560 --> 49:40.080
(locks clicking)

49:48.640 --> 49:50.080
Congrats, Mr. Mayor!

49:50.480 --> 49:52.760
Thanks, Pete. But I only just got the job.

49:53.360 --> 49:55.120
Now, time to see if I can deliver.

49:55.200 --> 49:56.520
(woman) I'm sure you will.

49:56.960 --> 49:58.800
The people have every faith in you.

49:59.440 --> 50:01.120
(chuckles) Thank you, ma'am.

50:04.120 --> 50:05.200
I won't let you down.

50:23.200 --> 50:24.200
(gasps)

50:25.320 --> 50:29.040
(Oliver) You know, kiddo, I had three
locks put on that door for a reason.

50:29.520 --> 50:31.200
Sorry, I guess curiosity.

50:33.120 --> 50:34.120
What the...

50:35.440 --> 50:37.080
Mr. Queen?

50:37.360 --> 50:38.600
What is all this?

50:38.920 --> 50:42.520
Very soon,
a great evil will befall Gotham.

50:42.960 --> 50:44.520
It's up to me to defeat it.

50:45.240 --> 50:46.240
Uh-huh.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.520
I see.

50:47.960 --> 50:49.520
And, uh, how's that?

50:50.200 --> 50:51.240
Have you forgotten?

50:51.640 --> 50:54.480
'The sins of the Father
are heaped upon the son.'

50:55.400 --> 50:58.480
No man is guilty
of more sin than my father.

51:00.000 --> 51:05.400
As impossible as it seems,
Henry Queen was over 300 years old.

51:06.280 --> 51:09.760
As it goes,
the cur made a pact with the devil.

51:10.800 --> 51:12.920
Over time it drove him mad.

51:13.840 --> 51:14.840
By the end,

51:15.280 --> 51:18.640
there was no vile deed
the wretched bastard would refuse.

51:19.400 --> 51:21.680
Including the cold-blooded murder

51:22.240 --> 51:24.080
of Thomas and Martha Wayne.

51:25.480 --> 51:29.400
He told me of this unholy act
perpetrated centuries ago.

51:30.000 --> 51:34.960
An act so wicked, so foul,
it stirred this thing

51:35.040 --> 51:37.000
that would one day destroy Gotham.

51:38.400 --> 51:42.960
So, in turn, I vowed to undo
each of those sins.

51:43.120 --> 51:46.920
I set about preparing to face
this impending doom he warned of.

51:47.280 --> 51:49.440
Testing myself against deadly beasts.

51:49.840 --> 51:51.920
Collecting all manner of holy weapons.

51:52.280 --> 51:54.000
Like these four arrows.

51:54.480 --> 51:57.920
Stained with the very blood
of St. Sebastian himself.

51:59.680 --> 52:01.760
Uh, listen, Mr. Queen, sir...

52:02.240 --> 52:03.240
You should go.

52:03.920 --> 52:05.520
This thing knows who I am.

52:06.360 --> 52:07.960
Surely, it will come for me.

52:08.800 --> 52:10.280
Though I've enjoyed your company,

52:10.760 --> 52:12.720
it's best you not be here when it does.

52:18.360 --> 52:20.240
(door opens, closes)

52:22.040 --> 52:23.040
The door...

52:24.160 --> 52:27.040
The doorway to our reality. Where?

52:27.120 --> 52:29.560
(ominous voice)
How is it you do not yet realize?

52:29.840 --> 52:31.600
Though you once feared them,

52:32.160 --> 52:35.280
only the bats know the way to salvation.

52:36.080 --> 52:38.800
You must accept as I have.

52:39.440 --> 52:41.040
Only they will tell...

52:41.200 --> 52:42.200
Damn it!

52:42.720 --> 52:43.880
We're running out of time!

52:44.400 --> 52:47.040
Why don't you tell me what the bats say!

52:47.800 --> 52:50.040
You said they speak to you, right?

52:50.400 --> 52:51.600
They surround you.

52:52.880 --> 52:53.880
You...

52:56.160 --> 52:58.080
The spirit wrapped in bats.

52:58.640 --> 52:59.640
Mr. Wayne.

53:00.160 --> 53:01.840
It's Oliver. I think he's...

53:03.920 --> 53:05.120
Lost his mind.

53:06.520 --> 53:09.480
Alfred told me to leave you alone,
because you weren't well. But...

53:12.800 --> 53:15.320
Golly, did he hold out cheap.

53:16.680 --> 53:19.720
Listen, sir. I don't understand
what's going on,

53:20.200 --> 53:21.600
but I can tell it's bad.

53:22.160 --> 53:23.160
Real bad.

53:23.600 --> 53:24.840
And whatever it is...

53:25.720 --> 53:27.600
Dick and Sanjay...

53:28.560 --> 53:30.000
Now, something's wrong with Oliver.

53:30.360 --> 53:33.320
He's dressed as a knight and going on
and on about a 'doom' that is coming.

53:36.400 --> 53:37.920
(Dr. West) Poison ivy, Mayor Dent.

53:38.080 --> 53:39.760
(Harvey) Oh. Come now.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.040
I haven't been out of the city in months,
Dr. West.

53:42.720 --> 53:44.440
Well, then, it's stress.

53:44.880 --> 53:46.920
You have had a demanding week, Harv.

53:47.840 --> 53:50.160
Now, find some time to relax. And...

53:50.800 --> 53:53.280
For Pete's sake, man! Don't scratch it!

53:53.520 --> 53:54.560
It'll just get infected.

53:55.320 --> 53:56.320
Here.

53:56.600 --> 53:57.600
Use this.

54:03.040 --> 54:07.280
(Oliver) Lord, grant me the strength
to destroy the thing that is coming.

54:10.720 --> 54:11.760
(footsteps approaching)

54:14.480 --> 54:16.400
Oh. Hello.

54:19.200 --> 54:21.520
Why, we were just talking about you.

54:28.040 --> 54:29.040
(screeching)

54:29.480 --> 54:31.080
(laughs) Thank goodness!

54:31.440 --> 54:34.080
If I'd killed you that easily,
there'd have been no sport.

54:35.360 --> 54:36.360
(grunts)

54:52.800 --> 54:53.920
(yelling)

54:57.680 --> 54:58.760
(groans)

55:04.120 --> 55:05.120
(screeches)

55:14.520 --> 55:16.040
(Oliver coughing)

55:18.000 --> 55:19.000
(groans)

55:21.200 --> 55:22.200
Bruce?

55:23.120 --> 55:24.120
Nice outfit.

55:25.440 --> 55:26.440
You, too.

55:27.120 --> 55:28.120
(Oliver) Showmanship.

55:28.680 --> 55:29.760
(groans)

55:32.760 --> 55:34.080
You look awful.

55:34.480 --> 55:35.480
(groans loudly)

55:36.000 --> 55:37.000
Easy, kid.

55:37.320 --> 55:38.520
At this point,

55:38.800 --> 55:40.840
they're all that's holding me together.

55:42.120 --> 55:43.320
But good news...

55:47.360 --> 55:50.960
And without using
any of St. Sebastian's arrows.

55:52.680 --> 55:54.680
Told you no fauna could best me.

55:55.480 --> 55:56.600
(chuckles weakly)

55:58.560 --> 55:59.560
Kai Li.

56:00.320 --> 56:01.320
Give us a minute.

56:10.320 --> 56:11.800
I thought I could stop it, Bruce.

56:11.880 --> 56:14.120
This thing...

56:14.200 --> 56:16.840
Thought I was ready,
but nothing could prepare...

56:16.920 --> 56:20.320
I know, Oliver. More than you realize.

56:22.880 --> 56:23.880
Bruce...

56:26.520 --> 56:28.280
Something I must confess...

56:29.560 --> 56:31.280
It's weighed on me for years.

56:31.840 --> 56:34.920
Old friend, my father...

56:35.520 --> 56:36.520
(sighs)

56:37.360 --> 56:39.800
I'm so sorry, Bruce, my father, he...

56:40.080 --> 56:42.280
Did what he did.

56:43.360 --> 56:47.800
You did nothing but live as a good man.

56:49.120 --> 56:50.360
That's all that matters.

56:50.480 --> 56:52.160
I hope you're right, Brucey...

56:53.760 --> 56:55.120
For both our sake.

56:55.800 --> 56:58.600
The bloodline can never escape the stain.

56:59.520 --> 57:01.720
The sins of the father.

57:38.720 --> 57:40.080
(wind whistles)

57:41.640 --> 57:43.800
Whoever you are, please,

57:45.040 --> 57:46.400
kill me.

57:47.200 --> 57:49.080
(Talia) Do not despair.

57:49.760 --> 57:51.160
The end is near.

57:52.520 --> 57:55.080
But you have a little more to do.

57:57.080 --> 57:58.280
(cawing)

58:07.640 --> 58:09.200
It's not your fault, Mr. Wayne.

58:10.560 --> 58:13.800
Talking dead folks, reptile plagues,
plant monsters, it's not...

58:14.960 --> 58:15.960
natural.

58:20.200 --> 58:22.120
No one could have seen this coming.

58:22.320 --> 58:23.600
I should have.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.800
The signs were there.

58:26.760 --> 58:28.040
I refused to heed them,

58:28.120 --> 58:31.320
because they didn't align
with what I deemed to be rational.

58:32.320 --> 58:36.360
- This thing, it is coming, huh?
- Soon.

58:36.920 --> 58:38.200
And I don't know how.

58:38.400 --> 58:40.000
But only I can stop it.

58:41.240 --> 58:43.800
With all due respect, sir,
Oliver said the same thing.

58:44.120 --> 58:45.400
And now he's dead.

58:45.480 --> 58:47.360
He died trying to do what was right.

58:47.560 --> 58:51.120
He died because he thought he owed
the world for whatever insanity his dad...

58:51.240 --> 58:54.960
- Oliver believed the sins of the father...
- Are heaped upon the son.

58:55.360 --> 58:56.840
Yeah. I know that verse.

58:57.120 --> 58:59.080
But don't forget Ezekiel 18,

58:59.160 --> 59:00.935
'The son will not share
the guilt of the father,

59:00.960 --> 59:02.840
nor will the father share
the guilt of the son.'

59:03.120 --> 59:05.720
My point is, you don't have to do this.

59:06.400 --> 59:08.320
You can leave. We can leave.

59:08.520 --> 59:10.640
Get a new ship and go anywhere else.

59:11.440 --> 59:13.400
You don't owe this city anything.

59:14.480 --> 59:17.440
Most people, if they see a house on fire,

59:17.760 --> 59:20.760
would run and call for help
once they're out of harm's way.

59:21.360 --> 59:24.000
While others, very few others,

59:24.640 --> 59:25.920
would run right into that house

59:26.000 --> 59:28.120
and try to save those
who are trapped inside.

59:29.560 --> 59:31.240
The moment I found you,

59:32.720 --> 59:36.880
my every instinct told me
which one of those two people you were.

59:39.480 --> 59:41.360
Doom or not, Kai Li,

59:42.200 --> 59:44.160
Gotham is a city on fire.

59:45.040 --> 59:48.720
It needs those who are willing
to run into the inferno.

59:51.120 --> 59:53.480
Bruce Wayne, there you are.

59:54.240 --> 59:55.960
Was there something you wanted, Jim?

59:56.440 --> 59:57.800
Uh, no.

59:58.360 --> 59:59.720
Yes, actually.

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.360
First, deeply sorry about your boys.
My condolences.

01:00:04.040 --> 01:00:05.720
I assure you my best men are on the...

01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.480
I'm here on behalf of my daughter.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.640
Barbara?

01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:12.440
She said she's been trying to reach you.

01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:14.240
I'm sure you've heard about her...

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.480
Accident a few years back? Yes.

01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:18.960
Poor thing. She hasn't been the same.

01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.640
Wait a minute. Barbara?

01:00:20.800 --> 01:00:22.880
Barbara Gordon? The Oracle, right?

01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.640
I read about her in Spiritualism Monthly!

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:29.040
Yes, I suppose Barbara has
developed something of a...

01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:31.760
reputation in certain circles.

01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.800
And she says she needs to speak to me?

01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.040
Not her, exactly.

01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.080
- One of her...
- Ghosts.

01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.160
She said you'd know who.

01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:43.360
Do you?

01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:44.880
I don't.

01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:48.520
Bruce, I realize it's an unusual request.
But it seemed...

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.480
so very urgent to my Barbara,
and it would...

01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:55.520
- It would mean a lot to me.
- Tell her I'll see her tonight.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.440
- Okay. But visiting hours are...
- Tonight!

01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:10.680
Do you think the Oracle will know
how to stop this thing?

01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:11.920
Not the Oracle,

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.720
but the spirit wrapped in flames.

01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:18.040
It's time.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.640
I can't let you leave.

01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.320
(Bruce) That's not your decision.

01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.080
You're not well. What's happening to you?

01:01:42.040 --> 01:01:43.800
What needs to happen.

01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:47.240
I can't pretend to know
exactly what I'm about to face.

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:51.560
But I do know that I must face it.

01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:55.560
This is what I was meant to do.

01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.080
- Bruce...
- Please, Alfred.

01:02:00.480 --> 01:02:02.040
I haven't much time.

01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:07.080
Very well then, Master Bruce.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.560
If time is of the essence, as you say...

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:16.680
May I suggest taking the car?

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.640
You're in charge of the wine cellar now.

01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:29.560
You're not coming back?

01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:44.280
Goodbye...

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.480
Son.

01:02:46.480 --> 01:02:48.840
Goodbye, Alfred.

01:03:19.160 --> 01:03:21.520
I'm glad you accepted my invitation.

01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:23.840
Although, I suppose, it should concern me

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.320
you're able to break into this place
so easily.

01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:28.240
(Batman) No offense,

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:31.240
but I'd say the greater concern
would be Arkham's ability

01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.040
to keep those from breaking out.

01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.800
Oh, it's not so bad in here, Bruce.

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.320
Three squares. Good company.

01:03:38.480 --> 01:03:42.240
A complete absence of unnecessary pity
from loved ones.

01:03:43.560 --> 01:03:45.640
Besides, if you saw as I do,

01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:49.840
you'd take the insanity within these walls
over the true madness out there.

01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:52.160
Perhaps you're right.

01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:54.920
So, a bat? Huh.

01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.800
Interesting creatures, aren't they?

01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.080
Funny how one little winged rodent
can mean so many different things

01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.040
to so many different people.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.000
If you ask me,

01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:10.120
it's all about their uncanny ability
to maneuver in the dark.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:14.400
Like they embody a perception
of the things that can't be seen.

01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.040
So, let me ask you.

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.200
What do they mean to you, Bruce?

01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:20.800
Why a bat?

01:04:21.080 --> 01:04:25.720
Bats inspire fear,
and criminals are superstitious and...

01:04:25.800 --> 01:04:27.400
Cowardly lot, sure.

01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.600
I figured that's what you'd say.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.640
But is that really why?

01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:34.880
Well, something to think about, I guess.

01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:38.160
Okay then, down to business
and the reason you've come.

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:40.320
Do you know with whom you need to speak?

01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:43.840
I wish to speak to the spirit
wrapped in flames.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.880
But you don't know who this spirit is?

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:49.760
Only that it burns in hell.

01:04:51.360 --> 01:04:53.400
And you're sure you want to do this?

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.280
It's not a question of want, Barbara.

01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.360
Spirit we seek, I surrender myself.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:10.720
Body and soul, come to us now.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.040
Come to us now.

01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.600
Come to us now!

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:22.240
Father?

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:24.360
It can't be.

01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:27.520
Hello, Bruce.

01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000
What is this?

01:05:29.280 --> 01:05:30.440
It's me, son.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.560
And I am so, so sorry.

01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:37.240
Believe me, I wanted to tell you this
when you were old enough.

01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:38.520
But not like this.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.120
Not here.

01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:41.720
Tell me what?

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:46.400
I, Thomas Wayne, was born in 1585

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:50.000
and was among the first colonists
to venture to the new world.

01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.720
I and others founded the settlement
that would one day become Gotham.

01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:59.680
Lo, but those first years
were unforgiving.

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.120
The land penurious.
The winters, harsh, indeed.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:06.720
We were dying.

01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:14.480
Until, one among us, Oswald Cobblepot
discovered what was buried

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:16.280
under the earth beneath our land.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:21.040
Myself, Bartly Langstrom, and Henry Queen

01:06:21.120 --> 01:06:24.120
followed Cobblepot into an ungodly place.

01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.520
He showed us the ancient book
he'd found there.

01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:33.400
A book steeped in malevolence.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:40.000
Call it despair, call it desperation,
call it, perhaps, even greed,

01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:43.040
but we four read from this book

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.120
- and performed its ceremonies most vile.
- (horse neighing)

01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.680
Shame of which would last eons.

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.280
But, alas, our settlement had been saved.

01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:55.560
Flourished, even.

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.760
And not only did the four of us
prosper beyond our wildest dreams,

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:04.080
we'd been gifted apparent life eternal.

01:07:04.560 --> 01:07:07.520
In time, it was nearly as if
we'd forgotten the events

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:10.560
of that despicable night ever occurred.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.040
It, however, did not forget us.

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.960
For centuries later,

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:21.320
we would learn that the malevolence
we bore that fateful night awoke him.

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:22.760
Iog Sotha.

01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:24.440
It was our wretchedness

01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:27.640
that drew the thing
to the threshold of our reality.

01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:29.600
You...

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.560
called him forth.

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:34.160
Knowing what we'd done, truly done,

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.160
drove Bartly Langstrom to suicide,

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.600
Oswald Cobblepot to the ends of the earth,

01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:42.320
and Henry Queen to...

01:07:42.840 --> 01:07:43.840
(yelling)

01:07:45.720 --> 01:07:51.400
Well, worst yet, the curse lays the burden
of undoing our misdeeds

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:53.080
upon our children.

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.120
The sins of the father
are heaped upon the son.

01:07:57.360 --> 01:07:58.440
Yes.

01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:03.400
That's why Kirk Langstrom
and Oliver both...

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:04.920
But it's not too late, son.

01:08:05.480 --> 01:08:07.400
You can stop this thing.

01:08:07.560 --> 01:08:09.920
Iog Sotha has not yet entered our realm.

01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:13.000
You must find the door
before it fully opens.

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.240
How?

01:08:14.640 --> 01:08:16.520
By becoming what you truly are.

01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.359
In coming to see me,

01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:22.439
you've accepted a world
beyond reason and science.

01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.479
But you must embrace it.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:27.160
You must seek communion...

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.200
With them.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:33.560
The bats.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:41.359
Thank you, Barbara.

01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:43.880
Thank you.

01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:02.279
(Batman chanting incantation)

01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:27.240
(ominous voice) You have returned.

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:32.359
It is time for Iog-Sotha.

01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:35.680
Only the bat can face him.

01:09:36.319 --> 01:09:40.800
You understand what that means now, yes?

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:43.439
I do. At last.

01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.040
Y ou are prepared for this sacrifice?

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:49.600
I am.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:54.920
Then now, you are one of us.

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:58.920
Just tell me where to find the thing.

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.360
Where it began.

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:16.800
(coin clinking)

01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.880
Harvey...

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:37.480
Poison Ivy, I'm told.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:41.000
Considering a second opinion.

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:44.800
Bruce?

01:10:46.640 --> 01:10:47.680
You take care of yourself.

01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.120
Huh?

01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.360
You too, Harv.

01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.520
I'll see you soon.

01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:08.960
(grunting)

01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:22.720
(grunts)

01:11:33.080 --> 01:11:34.080
(roars)

01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.920
Forgive me, boys.

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:00.320
(yelling)

01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:10.360
(growls)

01:12:13.440 --> 01:12:14.480
(grunts)

01:12:46.760 --> 01:12:48.040
Thank God.

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:50.600
Kick their ass, Bruce.

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.080
(Ra's al Ghul chanting incantation)

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:33.680
Iog Sotha,

01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.400
I feel your power.

01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:40.080
Yes!

01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:08.000
(Talia yells)

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:09.360
(groans)

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:12.280
(both grunting)

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:38.800
I'd rather like to think
that under different circumstances,

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.360
we'd be allies...

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:42.320
Friends, perhaps.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:44.680
(choking)

01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.240
(screams)

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.200
(Talia groans weakly)

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:58.440
My friends have a bad habit of dying.

01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:12.400
It's just you and me now.

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.920
(groans)

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.240
You fool.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:19.720
This thing...

01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.280
This thing
is beyond your human comprehension.

01:15:33.360 --> 01:15:34.680
Behold.

01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:42.640
For even to gaze upon it
is to incur madness!

01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:48.680
I've seen it.

01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:58.840
Do you not see?

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.560
The deed is done.

01:16:08.080 --> 01:16:09.640
I am him.

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:12.120
Born of the nameless mist,

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.440
progenitor of Yib Nogeroth,

01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:18.800
Hastur the unspeakable...

01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:25.560
And Cthulhu himself!

01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.240
(grunts)

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.000
Die!

01:16:37.520 --> 01:16:43.360
For soon all that lives shall
follow thee into Hell!

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:47.440
(screaming)

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:55.120
Humanity shall be wiped from the earth!

01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:58.160
(woman) What is that?

01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:04.800
(screaming)

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.120
(Blood) To prevail in this,

01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:11.240
Bruce Wayne must die
and through death become himself.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:14.480
(Oliver) The bloodline can never escape
the stain of sin...

01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:18.080
(Barbara) Why a bat?

01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:23.280
(ominous voice)
The bats know the way to salvation.

01:17:25.400 --> 01:17:27.720
(Thomas) You must embrace it.

01:17:28.600 --> 01:17:32.800
(ominous voice) Now!
You are now one of us.

01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:47.120
You're still alive?

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:49.360
(roaring)

01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.080
Not alive.

01:17:52.520 --> 01:17:54.200
Not anymore.

01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:56.600
What are you?

01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.280
I am Batman!

01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.600
(screaming)

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.280
Yes!

01:18:43.040 --> 01:18:44.040
(snarls)

01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:15.880
(high-pitched droning)

01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.960
(groaning)

01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:36.440
(screaming)

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.840
Etrigan...

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:12.960
(grunting)

01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:26.520
Well done. The ledger is clear.

01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:31.560
Now take your leave,
whilst I do my damage here.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:38.720
(Blood) You must seek out two spirits.

01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.920
One wrapped in bats, the other in flames.

01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:48.720
A price is to be paid for your dark reign

01:20:48.800 --> 01:20:53.240
and so here for eternity
in this hell you remain!

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.320
(Blood) Bruce Wayne must die,

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:03.920
and through death, become himself.

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:18.240
Before it can be truly saved,

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:22.520
Gotham must be burned to the ground.

01:21:30.360 --> 01:21:31.360
(people screaming)

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:42.360
(panting)

01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:07.640
(Lucius) Though this disaster
struck only months ago,

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:11.600
the Bruce Wayne memorial foundation
has already begun to rebuild.

01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:15.800
A better Gotham is in reach.

01:22:16.680 --> 01:22:21.000
And we'd like to dedicate this effort
to two dear friends of Mr. Wayne,

01:22:21.080 --> 01:22:22.480
and of Gotham itself.

01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:27.360
The honorable Harvey Dent
and Mr. Oliver Queen.

01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:28.520
(people clapping)

01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.400
And now,

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.560
the acting head of the foundation,

01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:44.560
Ms. Kai Li Cain.

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.920
I've not been here long,

01:22:52.280 --> 01:22:55.040
but thanks to Bruce, I've come
to think of Gotham as home.

01:22:56.160 --> 01:22:57.880
In many ways, my first home.

01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:01.800
Bruce Wayne had a vision of
what Gotham could be.

01:23:02.440 --> 01:23:03.480
An ideal.

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.400
I promise to do
everything within my power,

01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:08.640
and beyond my power,

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:12.000
to bring about the realization
of Bruce Wayne's dream

01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:13.480
for a new Gotham City.

01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.760
Speaking of Bruce,

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:18.480
for those of you who knew and loved him,

01:23:19.200 --> 01:23:21.400
take comfort in this final thought.

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:25.400
He wasn't always the most forthcoming man,

01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:28.600
but you could
always be sure of two things.

01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:32.000
He would do anything
for those that he loved,

01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:34.280
and he was stubborn as hell.

01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:38.120
I know Bruce is watching over us.

01:23:38.680 --> 01:23:40.480
And something tells me that if we,

01:23:41.120 --> 01:23:44.360
the people and city that he held so dear,
ever needed him,

01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:47.760
really needed him,

01:23:49.240 --> 01:23:52.560
not even death itself could keep him away.
