Ashley, you should know this by now.

10:11.986 --> 10:15.573
So, you're saying
that Ashley doesn't see you?

10:15.990 --> 10:17.575
I ain't saying nothing.

10:18.909 --> 10:20.745
Well then, let me say a little something.

10:21.162 --> 10:23.039
[in booming voice]
Other People's Shoes!

10:28.669 --> 10:30.921
Now, this is a role-playing exercise.

10:31.172 --> 10:34.091
If you can see yourself
through your partner's eyes,

10:34.383 --> 10:35.885
you might learn something.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.137
Ashley, you'll be Marlon.

10:38.220 --> 10:40.556
Marlon, you'll be Ashley.

10:41.265 --> 10:42.141
Begin.

10:46.854 --> 10:48.689
Yo, what's up? I'm Marlon.

10:48.773 --> 10:50.107
And I know I'm mad late,

10:50.191 --> 10:52.401
but I'll make up for it on the back end

10:52.485 --> 10:55.237
as I tend to overstay my welcome.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.908
[chuckles]
I do do that.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.660
[laughs]

11:00.743 --> 11:01.702
That's pretty good.

11:01.994 --> 11:05.247
And divorce should've been
a wake-up call for me,

11:05.331 --> 11:07.041
but I haven't changed at all.

11:07.124 --> 11:09.543
I still drop over her house,

11:09.627 --> 11:11.128
leave her my laundry,

11:11.212 --> 11:13.422
and stink up her bathroom.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.426
All right, my turn? Okay.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.388
Hi, I'm Ashley.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.181
And I'm a black white girl

11:22.264 --> 11:25.476
which means I'm super articulate
and I love to curse people out.

11:26.769 --> 11:29.980
And I still complain
about all the things that you are

11:30.064 --> 11:34.443
that I knew you were
before I even married you.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.070
Oh, my god.

11:37.196 --> 11:38.197
He's right.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.782
Thank you. Game over.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.034
I won therapy. Whoo-hoo!

11:43.494 --> 11:45.955
I enable all of his behavior.

11:46.288 --> 11:49.250

11:49.542 --> 11:52.002
Trademark, Shabazz Enterprises,

11:52.086 --> 11:53.671
soon as I file the paperwork.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.423
Thank you.

11:55.923 --> 11:58.467
Oh, excuse me. Did I miss something?

11:58.551 --> 12:00.052
[stutters]
I thought I won therapy.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.805
Why is y'all sitting here
having black girl magic?

12:04.682 --> 12:07.435
See, your problem probably
isn't even in your neck.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.355
You're right. My problem's
in a tweed jacket and glasses.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.900
Nerve endings in the feet
connect to the entire body,

12:14.984 --> 12:16.861
serving as a road map of sorts. For example, the heel of the foot

12:19.530 --> 12:21.115
interacts with the lower back.

12:21.574 --> 12:25.119
Actually, that's not so bad.
[chuckles]

12:25.244 --> 12:27.288
While this little piggy
connects to the neck.

12:28.330 --> 12:29.582
Oh, wow.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.250
And this is your spine, and...

12:31.667 --> 12:32.918
I can't remember what this is.

You're on a plane that's going down.

13:00.779 --> 13:03.866
Call Ashley and tell her
everything you never said.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.076
Put yourself in this, Marlon. Go!

13:06.660 --> 13:07.578
Okay.

13:10.331 --> 13:11.499
[sighs]

13:11.582 --> 13:12.416
Hello?

13:13.042 --> 13:14.126
Hello, Ashley.

13:15.419 --> 13:18.339
I'm on a plane, and it's going down.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.759
And I have so many regrets, and--

13:21.842 --> 13:22.927
You do?

13:23.010 --> 13:24.428
Yes.

13:25.137 --> 13:27.181
But I'll tell you when I land,
because right now,

13:27.264 --> 13:28.974
I have to save all these people
on the plane.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.392

Oh, excuse me.

Oh, damn window seat.
Excuse me, move. Excuse me.

13:36.815 --> 13:39.527
[Marlon groaning]
Gotta make it to the cockpit.

Captain!

13:43.948 --> 13:45.449
Oh, he's unconscious.

13:45.533 --> 13:49.453
[groans]
He's a lot heavier than I thought.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.455
Come on, Captain.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.082
Come on, I'm gonna drag your ass

13:53.165 --> 13:56.377
like they dragged that Chinese guy
on United Airlines.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.045
[Marlon] Come on!

13:58.379 --> 14:00.965
Get your... Get your ass over here.
[groans]

14:01.090 --> 14:02.091
[gasping]

14:02.174 --> 14:03.884
He needs mouth to mouth resuscitation.

14:03.968 --> 14:07.638
Don't worry. I'm not gonna let
society's prejudices stop me

14:07.721 --> 14:09.265
from saving another man's life.

14:09.598 --> 14:11.016
Oh, damn, that's a cold sore.

14:11.100 --> 14:13.102
Sorry, Captain. You're gonna die today.

14:13.561 --> 14:15.312
Oh, god! Ugh!

14:15.938 --> 14:16.981
It's terrorists!

14:17.064 --> 14:19.358
Watch out, everybody!
Get down! The terrorist got me!

14:19.441 --> 14:21.777
[groaning]

14:21.861 --> 14:23.195
I gotta break free! Ugh!

14:23.279 --> 14:24.780
I'll hit them with this itchy blanket.

14:24.864 --> 14:25.990
Come here!

14:26.073 --> 14:27.575
The itchy airline blanket kill!

14:27.658 --> 14:29.243
[panting]

14:29.326 --> 14:31.203
I'll hide in this first-class curtain.

14:31.704 --> 14:32.955
Welcome to coach!

you know why?

14:44.174 --> 14:45.050
[grunts]

14:45.134 --> 14:47.303
'Cause I'm passenger 57.

Everybody, fasten your seatbelts!

14:52.975 --> 14:54.560
Put your tray tables up!

14:54.643 --> 14:55.978
Put your oxygen mask on!

14:56.061 --> 14:58.188
Wait, those aren't oxygen masks.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.440
Those are snakes!

15:22.463 --> 15:27.009
Yeah. If I could just take to the cockpit!

15:27.551 --> 15:28.719
Everybody be calm!

15:28.802 --> 15:31.931
If Kevin Hart's career

15:44.318 --> 15:45.486
Oh. The plane's leveled out.

15:47.404 --> 15:49.865
Hello, ladies and gentlemen,
this is your captain speaking.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.285
We are now cruising
at an altitude of 30,000 feet.

15:53.369 --> 15:54.286
[panting]

15:54.370 --> 15:55.537
We will be landing in Vegas

15:55.621 --> 15:59.333
where I'll be hosting a dope-ass
after-party at the Bellagio.

16:00.376 --> 16:05.255
All the flight attendants, please meet me
in the galley way by the bathrooms.

16:05.714 --> 16:07.466
You're joining the Mile High Club. I should've seen that coming.

16:15.641 --> 16:16.475
Okay.

16:16.558 --> 16:19.061
Doctor Shabazz doesn't need
to see any more.

16:19.478 --> 16:20.813
Your marriage was doomed,

16:20.896 --> 16:24.024
and I'm sorry to say, so is your divorce.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.528
[upbeat music]

16:27.778 --> 16:28.779
Doomed?

16:29.863 --> 16:31.365
Ashley, she don't know. Tell her.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.577
Marlon, she has three masters and a PhD.

16:36.036 --> 16:38.288
And I feel how I felt
in the middle of our marriage,

16:38.372 --> 16:40.249
like I'm doing this by myself.

16:40.332 --> 16:41.625
And I won't do that again.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.671
I need a divorce from our divorce.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.966
Come on, Ash. You can't believe her
just because she got a PhD.

16:49.049 --> 16:50.759
Look, my cousin Dougie got a PhD

16:50.843 --> 16:54.138
and his momma still gotta pin his gloves
to his damn coat sleeves.

16:57.266 --> 17:00.811
I also have six best-selling
relationship books.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.605
Not to mention,
I've been married five times.

17:05.023 --> 17:07.192
I think I know when something's done.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.944
Five times?

17:10.362 --> 17:12.865
What's your PhD in?
Driving brothers crazy?

17:14.700 --> 17:16.117
Hold up, mickey fickey.

17:16.993 --> 17:19.079
You can talk sideways to Ashley,

17:19.204 --> 17:20.789
but I ain't the one.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.791
See now, you dragged your sorry ass
up into my office,

17:23.876 --> 17:25.377
talking about "she tripping."

17:25.461 --> 17:27.463
No, negro, she was trying!

17:27.880 --> 17:31.050
And you running around here talking
about some damn snakes on a plane

17:31.133 --> 17:33.677
and busting up my office
like the damn LAPD.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.889
And now she's gone.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.308
She'll be all right.

17:41.226 --> 17:42.144
Really?

17:42.311 --> 17:43.520
Where she at?

17:43.604 --> 17:44.730
Ashley!

17:44.813 --> 17:45.898
Ashley?

17:45.981 --> 17:47.316
She under the table?

17:47.399 --> 17:51.403
Hm? Maybe the gravitational pull
pulled out the damn window.

17:54.239 --> 17:57.785
You had an opportunity to save this.

17:57.868 --> 18:00.120
Ashley asked you
to come here and participate,

18:00.204 --> 18:01.497
but you refused.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.414
Why?

18:03.457 --> 18:05.125
Because I do what I wanna do.

18:05.209 --> 18:06.502
This how I roll.

18:06.794 --> 18:08.629
I know that's how you roll.

18:08.712 --> 18:11.340
I'm asking you, why do you roll like that?

18:11.590 --> 18:14.510
Because I don't like people telling me
what to do, all right?

18:14.593 --> 18:17.346
I'm the youngest of ten kids,
and I got bossed around my whole life.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.932
Do you know what it's like
being the youngest of ten kids? Huh?

18:20.015 --> 18:22.101
You got a brother teaching you
how to cross the street

18:22.184 --> 18:23.644
at damn four years old.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.479
What the hell he gonna teach
a three-year-old? We both got hit by the damn car.

18:29.900 --> 18:33.195
So, I just like doing what I wanna do.
I'm a grown ass man.

18:33.445 --> 18:35.823
And if Ashley don't like it,
well, she ain't gotta be here.

18:36.573 --> 18:41.203
Marlon, Ashley doesn't want
to change you or how you roll.

18:41.662 --> 18:44.581
All she's asking you to do is...

18:45.457 --> 18:46.458
Try.

18:47.876 --> 18:48.919
She wants me to try.

18:52.840 --> 18:53.966
Breakthrough.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.300
New you.

18:56.009 --> 19:00.430
Marlon, relationships only work
when both people try.

19:00.889 --> 19:03.559
And I didn't learn that from any PhD.

19:04.059 --> 19:06.728
I learned that from my own five failed...

19:06.812 --> 19:08.564
[sobbing]
marriages.

19:10.315 --> 19:11.191
[sobs]

19:11.275 --> 19:17.030
Now there's a bunch of people out there
who I love who don't love me.

19:17.698 --> 19:20.784
-[sobbing]
-Okay, okay. Okay, hey.

19:21.076 --> 19:22.870
Hey, breakthrough. New you.

19:22.953 --> 19:25.372
[upbeat music]

19:28.000 --> 19:31.003
[cell phone ringing]

19:32.337 --> 19:33.338
Ash, pick up.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.090
Marlon, I'm not in the mood.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.092
Ash, please. It's an emergency.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.845
[sighs]

19:41.221 --> 19:43.140
Ashley, I'm on a plane,
and it's going down.

19:44.516 --> 19:46.268
And I have a lot of regrets.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.478
I regret that I could never
palm a basketball.

19:49.062 --> 19:50.898
I regret that I never banged Apollonia.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.442
Enjoy your flight.

19:53.525 --> 19:56.445
Wait, wait, wait! Listen.
Listen, I have real regrets, too.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.615
I regret that I never tried.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.827
But if I had another chance,

20:04.745 --> 20:05.954
I would try.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.333
I would try in our divorce
the way I didn't try in our marriage.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.922
But now I can't 'cause I'm stuck
in this busted-ass plane, full of regrets.

20:15.923 --> 20:17.382
-Marlon.
-Hm?

20:18.634 --> 20:19.635
Pick up.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.345
[Marlon sniffles]

20:23.597 --> 20:25.599
Um, listen.

20:26.600 --> 20:28.518
I really appreciate this call.

20:29.478 --> 20:30.729
And I'll tell you what.

20:31.355 --> 20:36.485
If you're, um, willing to kick in
that cockpit door,

20:36.568 --> 20:38.445
and save all the people on the plane,

20:39.279 --> 20:41.573
and make your way back to me and the kids,

20:41.740 --> 20:43.659
then I'm willing
to give you another chance.

20:44.284 --> 20:46.119
Okay. Bet.

20:47.621 --> 20:48.997
I'll be home soon.

20:49.623 --> 20:50.666
You know why?

20:51.416 --> 20:53.001
I'm passenger 57.

20:53.377 --> 20:54.795

20:57.214 --> 20:59.383

21:00.467 --> 21:01.969
[upbeat music]
