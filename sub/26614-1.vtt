00:58.526 --> 01:07.435
Gentlemen, let's give it up for the Candy
Cat Club's featured dancer - Duffy.

03:06.354 --> 03:08.289
You're beautiful.

03:08.322 --> 03:11.292
Thanks, baby.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.536
Be polite all you want, kid.

03:22.570 --> 03:26.474
The only thing it's going to
get you is the poor house.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.876
Sorry.

03:38.519 --> 03:43.591
Next up on our stage, please
welcome the seductive Sasha.

03:51.499 --> 03:57.338
All right. One for the money

03:57.371 --> 03:59.440
two for the show.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.575
You have no clue what I'm about.

04:01.609 --> 04:06.480
All you know about me is what
you see on the stage, okay?

04:06.514 --> 04:09.617
And don't you ever think you
can put your hands on me again.

04:09.650 --> 04:12.420
Stripper drama.

04:18.426 --> 04:21.394
Hey! Slow down, honey. Okay?

04:21.428 --> 04:23.464
Not now, Rikki, okay? Just
leave me alone.

04:23.497 --> 04:25.566
Okay. Well, listen, enough of
the attitude.

04:25.599 --> 04:28.469
All right. I am only trying to
help you, Duffy.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.371
Well, if you really want to
help me

04:30.404 --> 04:32.406
then just leave me alone for
awhile

04:32.440 --> 04:33.474
because I'm a little freaked
out right now

04:33.507 --> 04:36.410
and I don't want to talk about
it.

04:50.458 --> 04:52.360
So what the hell's up with you?

04:52.393 --> 04:54.328
Just let her be, Tina.

04:54.362 --> 04:59.299
Oh, because she's queen bee I'm
supposed to just mind my own business.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.300
What a concept.

05:00.334 --> 05:01.369
I will mess you up.

05:01.402 --> 05:03.504
Come on, Tina.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.573
You don't want the cops coming
down here again like before.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.476
Okay. One more incident like
that and you're through.

05:08.509 --> 05:10.478
She thinks she's some kind of
big shot.

05:10.511 --> 05:17.418
Always draining every guy's wallet
before anybody else gets a shot at them.

05:17.451 --> 05:21.489
She even took my best customer.

05:21.522 --> 05:25.058
There ain't a dollar bill left
out there.

05:28.529 --> 05:31.365
Do you want to talk about it?

05:31.399 --> 05:33.434
Talk about what?

05:33.467 --> 05:35.302
Well, all that screaming I
heard a couple of minutes ago.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.372
No, I don't.

05:38.406 --> 05:40.474
Okay, well... I'm here if you
need me.

05:40.508 --> 05:44.378
I know, Zoe. I get it, okay.

05:44.412 --> 05:46.447
(whispers) Whatever.

06:20.380 --> 06:24.485
It's really coming down out
there.

06:24.518 --> 06:27.555
Weather man says it's going to be raining
cats and dogs until tomorrow afternoon.

06:27.588 --> 06:30.491
Gary's always wrong. He's not
even a meteorologist.

06:30.524 --> 06:33.527
That's why I watch Channel
Eight weather.

06:37.465 --> 06:38.532
Is the copy in the prompter?

06:38.566 --> 06:41.368
Done. Only breaking story right
now.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.436
Murder in Tinseltown.

06:42.470 --> 06:44.505
Well, what got dropped?

06:44.538 --> 06:45.439
The piece about the cat that
plays the piano.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.608
Oh, I liked that one.

06:47.641 --> 06:51.244
Turns out he was faking. Ten
seconds, everybody. Here we go.

06:51.278 --> 06:55.415
Five, four...

06:55.449 --> 07:00.488
Good evening, I'm Constance Turner and this
is a Channel Six overnight news break.

07:00.521 --> 07:02.355
Police are searching for clues
tonight

07:02.389 --> 07:06.527
in the shooting death of a young
dancer outside a downtown strip club.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.930
The shooting victim was shot
execution style in the club's

07:09.963 --> 07:13.433
back parking lot just after
midnight.

07:13.467 --> 07:17.471
Police released these photos of
the shooting victim.

07:17.505 --> 07:28.415
Twenty-six year old, Ann Turner, who worked
as a dancer at the Candy Cat... police..

07:28.448 --> 07:29.483
What's going on with her?

07:29.517 --> 07:30.417
...are hoping that anybody...

07:30.450 --> 07:32.452
I don't know.

07:32.486 --> 07:36.657
(On TV) ...any...

07:36.690 --> 07:45.599
police hope that anybody who has
seen anything will contact them

07:45.633 --> 07:49.436
and... and we will be back
right after the break...

07:49.469 --> 07:51.539
(On TV) Spring is just around
the corner...

08:03.584 --> 08:07.454
Constance, it's Doctor Hubbard.

08:07.487 --> 08:14.628
I just saw what happened. If you
want to talk about it I'm here.

08:23.370 --> 08:27.507
Hey, you okay?

08:27.541 --> 08:33.547
Yeah. I just lost my place. And
I... I... just that...

08:33.581 --> 08:38.318
I'll be fine. Let's... just let
me finish it.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.318
You sure?

08:39.352 --> 08:42.322
Yes. We're almost back.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.492
Okay.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.496
(On TV) - And it looks like the rain
will continue through tomorrow afternoon

08:49.529 --> 08:55.636
so if you have any weekend travel plans,
make sure you give yourself extra time.

09:34.441 --> 09:39.346
Okay. Good. Morning crew's going to
be here soon. You did a good job.

09:39.379 --> 09:43.516
Thanks.

09:43.550 --> 09:50.323
That story about the dancer?
Did you know her?

09:50.357 --> 09:53.393
She was my sister.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.328
Wow.

09:55.362 --> 10:00.367
You know, she was the wild
child of the family, you know.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.303
She was willful and headstrong.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.439
She was always just so
determined to do her own thing

10:06.473 --> 10:09.542
no matter what it did to my
parents.

10:09.576 --> 10:12.445
Look, I feel like I'm prying
here now.

10:12.479 --> 10:18.418
No. It's all right. Look, I am sorry.
I should have told someone.

10:18.451 --> 10:26.293
I understand. I mean this has to
be incredibly difficult for you.

10:26.326 --> 10:30.363
I... I... I should have reached
out to her more.

10:30.397 --> 10:35.302
I should have been a better sister
and she did not deserve this.

10:35.335 --> 10:40.373
Look, tell you what. This has
been a big shock for you.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.475
Why don't I give you a ride home
and we can talk about it, okay?

10:42.509 --> 10:46.413
Come on. Come on. Come on.

10:46.446 --> 10:47.447
Thanks, John.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.283
You're welcome. Watch your step.

10:50.317 --> 10:54.621
So, maybe I should contact the
police. Tell them who I am.

10:54.654 --> 10:57.457
No. Police can wait until
you've rested.

10:57.490 --> 11:01.361
There's nothing you're going to say now
that's going to make a difference.

11:01.394 --> 11:03.463
Maybe you're right.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.367
I am right. Besides the world's
going to know soon enough.

11:07.400 --> 11:11.504
And I just... I just wish it
didn't have to be you.

11:11.538 --> 11:13.540
You're going to get through it,
okay?

11:13.573 --> 11:18.411
And people will stop caring as soon as the
next big story comes along. Guaranteed.

11:18.445 --> 11:24.551
Well, isn't that the problem, John?
That people always just stop caring.

11:24.584 --> 11:34.494
That's the way it is, Constance. And
sometimes that's the way it should be.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.596
I'm going home. I can drive
myself.

11:36.629 --> 11:42.435
Hey? You going to be okay? I
can follow you.

11:42.469 --> 11:49.309
I'll be fine. And if I'm not, maybe
that's the way it should be.

14:13.453 --> 14:16.389
Ah! (screams)

14:20.460 --> 14:26.566
Look at that. Rain's all cleared up. Told
you that Doppler stuff was overrated.

14:26.599 --> 14:36.443
A couple of sausage. Here we go. And voilÃ .
Your breakfast, mademoiselle.

14:36.476 --> 14:39.479
I appreciate you coming by but
you didn't have to.

14:39.512 --> 14:45.452
Says you. I talked to Rebecca
and I told her what happened.

14:45.485 --> 14:50.357
She said you could take some
time off if you need to.

14:50.390 --> 14:54.794
I... I don't know how to say
this, John,

14:54.827 --> 14:58.331
but I am capable of making my
own decisions.

14:58.365 --> 15:02.435
I don't need anybody acting on
my behalf.

15:02.469 --> 15:10.377
I know it was well intentioned, but I
stand on my own two feet. I always have.

15:10.410 --> 15:15.515
Okay. I... thought I was
helping. So I'm sorry.

15:15.548 --> 15:17.384
I know.

15:20.520 --> 15:30.497
Just, now, I am going to be linked to
Annie's story and I have to face that fact.

15:30.530 --> 15:37.437
You know everything's going to change and
if I hide it's just going to make it worse.

15:37.470 --> 15:43.010
Maybe. For awhile. I do have
some sleeping pills

15:43.043 --> 15:44.377
or something stronger if you
need it.

15:44.411 --> 15:50.517
No. No, thank you. I... I
just... I don't take anything.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.220
I didn't say you did.

15:53.253 --> 15:58.425
Why are you trying to help me?

15:58.458 --> 16:02.529
Because you're my friend and
I'm worried about you.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.631
Fair enough.

16:04.664 --> 16:09.436
So, I got some errands I got to do. So I
will see you at work tonight, I guess, huh?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.537
Of course.

16:10.570 --> 16:13.540
Okay. Take care.

16:35.395 --> 16:39.399
Doctor Hubbard? Yeah, can I
come by?

16:42.602 --> 16:47.574
I saw your broadcast last night.
I became concerned about you.

16:47.607 --> 16:57.517
You're not the only one. I guess I'm just
kind of walking in my sleep right now.

16:57.550 --> 16:59.552
Did you take anything?

16:59.586 --> 17:09.496
No. No. I wouldn't. You're my sponsor.
I would have called you.

17:09.529 --> 17:14.434
I know. But I'm also your friend. And
you're right, you should have called me.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.303
I'm sorry.

17:16.336 --> 17:18.338
So what do the police know?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.540
I got a call this morning from
some detective

17:20.573 --> 17:26.413
but they don't sound that interested
in the death of a stripper.

17:26.445 --> 17:29.449
I'm sure that's not the case.

17:29.482 --> 17:36.589
I didn't tell anyone. You know,
that I had a... a sister.

17:36.623 --> 17:38.525
Even John was surprised.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.560
John, your producer.

17:40.593 --> 17:50.503
Yeah. My producer and well, he'd
like it to be something more.

17:52.539 --> 17:53.773
Uh...

18:01.614 --> 18:06.553
Um... how do I put this?

18:06.586 --> 18:16.496
I... I don't want you to get
involved with a man right now.

18:16.529 --> 18:22.569
Look, you've come so far in
reconciling your family issues

18:22.602 --> 18:27.474
and I would hate for you to lose
sight of what's really important.

18:27.507 --> 18:32.579
Your sister was a big reason
for all of this.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.314
But she's dead.

18:34.347 --> 18:36.583
Death is not the end.

18:36.616 --> 18:43.423
For Ann to truly get out of your life,
you have to be willing to let her go.

18:46.359 --> 18:51.431
You're so Zen. That's why I
like you.

18:51.464 --> 18:56.369
Look, I'm just a counselor.

18:56.403 --> 19:04.377
It's okay, Doctor. It really is.

19:04.411 --> 19:14.487
Okay. Well, then do me a favor just call
me more frequently just for my sake, okay?

19:14.521 --> 19:16.423
Okay.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.466
(whispers) Yeah.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.381
The Candy Cat welcomes...

19:41.414 --> 19:42.449
...the southern belle who's a
blonde bombshell.

19:42.482 --> 19:46.453
Let's give it up for Britney.

21:31.358 --> 21:33.360
Would you like a dance?

21:33.393 --> 21:35.462
No, thank you.

21:35.495 --> 21:39.298
Are you looking for a job?
There's an opening.

21:39.332 --> 21:40.533
I have to go. I'm sorry.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.476
Help me.

23:18.431 --> 23:21.768
Hey, how you doing? You know I tried
to return your call a few times

23:21.801 --> 23:22.435
but it went right to voicemail.

23:22.469 --> 23:25.271
Anything wrong?

23:25.304 --> 23:30.209
Uh... no. I just wanted to tell you I'm going
to take a few days off, like Rebecca offered.

23:30.242 --> 23:34.547
Good. Give you time to clear
your head. Be good for you.

23:34.581 --> 23:37.383
And also, one more thing, I
need you to do me a favor.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.553
Mmm... anything. What?

23:40.587 --> 23:45.291
Do you still have that police
detective friend?

23:45.324 --> 23:47.494
Yeah.

23:47.527 --> 23:49.529
Do you think he could get me a
copy of Ann's file?

23:49.562 --> 23:53.466
I just want to find out what
they know.

23:53.500 --> 23:56.503
I'll tell you what I'll do.

23:56.536 --> 24:01.340
I'll see what I can find out but you gotta promise me
you'll leave the police work to the professionals.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.543
Got it?

24:03.576 --> 24:05.512
Sounds like you're telling me
what to do again.

24:10.349 --> 24:12.519
Oh, my God. What am I doing?

24:17.490 --> 24:21.460
I'm just going to go in there
and ask a few questions.

24:21.494 --> 24:25.532
There's nothing wrong with
that. I'll be fine.

24:29.468 --> 24:31.303
The Candy Cat welcomes...

24:31.337 --> 24:33.506
...the sexy Zoe.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.354
Hey.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.625
Hi. You're new here.

25:58.658 --> 26:05.064
I just came to get a drink. And
I saw you looking at me.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.669
You remind me of someone who
worked here.

26:09.702 --> 26:16.242
Someone very pretty. She got
killed.

26:16.275 --> 26:20.312
Did you know her well... the
girl that got killed?

26:20.346 --> 26:23.683
Well, you never really get to
know the girls, do you?

26:23.716 --> 26:29.455
But Duffy, she was great.

26:29.488 --> 26:35.494
Some of the other girls just want to shake
you down for tips and dances but Duffy...

26:35.527 --> 26:37.496
she liked to talk.

26:37.529 --> 26:41.433
She did? I mean what did she
talk about?

26:41.467 --> 26:44.503
Hello. Are you here to apply
for a job?

26:44.536 --> 26:47.306
You want to come over to the
bar and talk to me?

26:47.339 --> 26:48.374
Yes.

26:48.407 --> 26:50.376
Okay. My name is Rikki.

26:50.409 --> 26:51.410
Connie.

26:51.443 --> 26:54.313
Come on.

26:54.346 --> 26:56.282
Bye, Connie.

27:41.427 --> 27:47.299
Well, I do have to say that you
have a... very nice look.

27:47.333 --> 27:51.437
And... we are kind of
shorthanded at the moment.

27:51.470 --> 27:53.439
Yeah, I heard about what
happened.

27:53.472 --> 27:54.506
All right, guys, I want you to make some
noise. Let's give it up for... for Tina.

27:54.540 --> 27:56.475
Did you know her well?

27:56.508 --> 27:59.511
Who, Duffy? Yeah, of course I
did.

27:59.545 --> 28:03.549
And I take a very personal
interest in each one of my girls.

28:03.582 --> 28:06.518
I mean I... I have to.

28:06.552 --> 28:08.454
Why is that?

28:08.487 --> 28:10.622
Well, because I'm like their
Mother Hen.

28:10.656 --> 28:15.427
I've been there, done that and
these girls are like lost souls.

28:15.461 --> 28:22.568
They're like kids that have foster parents
that don't care whether they live or die.

28:22.601 --> 28:25.571
I guess they're really lucky to
have you.

28:25.604 --> 28:28.574
Don't fool yourself. I am no
pushover.

28:28.607 --> 28:36.482
You do junk, you rip off my customers, you
steal from me, and there will be hell to pay.

28:36.515 --> 28:38.317
Tow the line or else?

28:38.350 --> 28:41.587
That's about the size of it.
So, what do you think?

28:41.620 --> 28:42.354
You want the job?

28:42.388 --> 28:45.291
Yes. Please.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.394
You've never danced before in
your life have you?

28:48.427 --> 28:52.899
No. I just really...

28:56.468 --> 28:57.970
I need the money.

28:58.004 --> 29:00.606
Oh, boy. Amen. Don't we all,
sister.

29:00.639 --> 29:05.511
Look, I got a big empty hole in tomorrow
night's roster so if you want to show up,

29:05.544 --> 29:10.382
you want to shake it a little bit. I don't tell
the girls how far they can go with the guys.

29:10.416 --> 29:14.586
But one thing directly affects the
other, if you know what I mean.

29:14.620 --> 29:17.589
I know what you're talking
about.

29:17.623 --> 29:23.462
Okay, have your start paper filled out and
also what I need from you is your stage name.

29:23.495 --> 29:25.531
Stage name?

29:25.564 --> 29:30.336
Yeah. All the girls have stage names. No
one uses their real names around here.

29:30.369 --> 29:35.307
Oh. Um... Ann.

29:35.341 --> 29:41.613
Ann? Ann? Okay, well that's
kind of dull.

29:41.647 --> 29:45.317
Uh... do I fill out my
paperwork here?

29:45.351 --> 29:47.386
No, you can take this paperwork
to the dressing room.

29:47.419 --> 29:50.222
It's just down the hall and
introduce yourself to the girls

29:50.256 --> 29:53.259
and I'm sure you will all get
along just fine.

29:54.526 --> 29:55.427
Thank you so much.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.963
Thank you.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.501
Thanks.

30:10.509 --> 30:13.412
Hi, I'm Ann.

30:13.445 --> 30:18.384
Hi. Hey, do you know anything about
these, like, clasp fastener thingies?

30:18.417 --> 30:20.386
I can't get this one to pop
like the other one

30:20.419 --> 30:23.422
and it's just, like, not as
hot, you know?

30:23.455 --> 30:28.527
Try squeezing it first.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.530
Oh! (laughs) It works! Thanks.

30:31.563 --> 30:32.498
You just started?

30:32.531 --> 30:35.301
Tomorrow.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.403
Have you ever done anything
like this before?

30:37.436 --> 30:41.507
No. Does it show?

30:41.540 --> 30:45.411
Well, you're still standing there
like you're afraid to sit down.

30:45.444 --> 30:47.413
Just take a load off.

30:47.446 --> 30:49.415
Right. Thanks.

30:54.586 --> 30:56.555
Hey, aren't you scared to work
here?

30:56.588 --> 31:02.561
You mean what happened to that other
dancer? Did you hear anything about that?

31:02.594 --> 31:04.496
It's a robbery. Maybe.

31:04.530 --> 31:06.432
Maybe?

31:06.465 --> 31:08.400
Yeah, maybe.

31:08.434 --> 31:12.404
Duffy didn't make very many friends here.
Especially not with Tina.

31:12.438 --> 31:15.607
Oh, and she really didn't like Misty. She
was real jealous. Oh, and then this...

31:15.641 --> 31:23.482
Britney! Why don't you just shut your mouth
about things you don't know anything about.

31:23.515 --> 31:29.421
Some of our regulars aren't
exactly gentlemen.

31:29.455 --> 31:33.459
I don't know. I've been thinking
it's a good time to retire.

31:33.492 --> 31:37.363
Or just move. I hear they always
need good dancers in Canada.

31:37.396 --> 31:41.500
It's way too cold up there and
who you going to dance for?

31:41.533 --> 31:45.837
Lumberjacks. I mean it's got to be
better and safer than this place.

31:45.871 --> 31:49.475
Oh, well. I'm up.

31:49.508 --> 31:51.310
Gotta go.

31:54.613 --> 31:57.349
Good luck, Ann. See you
tomorrow.

31:58.450 --> 32:00.286
Thanks.

32:01.620 --> 32:04.556
You're sitting in my station.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.496
You new or something?

32:11.497 --> 32:13.465
I'm Ann.

32:13.499 --> 32:18.470
Great. Don't even think about
looking at any of my regulars.

32:18.504 --> 32:23.475
I will seriously mess you up if
you do, got me?

32:23.509 --> 32:25.511
Sure.

32:25.544 --> 32:29.415
Tina, don't be so mean. She's
never even danced before.

32:29.448 --> 32:34.320
I know. And those creeps eat
girls like her for lunch.

32:34.353 --> 32:41.293
Okay. I'm up after Zoe. See you
guys later.

32:41.327 --> 32:44.530
Tina, can I ask you a question?

32:44.563 --> 32:45.464
Get away from me.

32:50.636 --> 32:53.472
Who are you? New girl?

32:53.505 --> 32:55.407
Ann.

32:55.441 --> 32:58.277
Ann?

32:58.310 --> 33:00.312
That was Duffy's real name.

33:00.346 --> 33:04.583
I don't know anything about
that.

33:04.616 --> 33:07.619
She made somebody really mad.

33:07.653 --> 33:12.291
And that person was you?

33:12.324 --> 33:22.301
No. Not me. I'm Pax. Bartender.

33:22.334 --> 33:25.171
I make it my business to know
all the dancers.

33:27.506 --> 33:29.508
Bully for you.

33:29.541 --> 33:37.516
I'm not a bully, baby. I'm a lover.
Can't wait to see your act.

33:47.526 --> 33:50.462
Damn.

34:40.478 --> 34:42.447
Where you going in such a
hurry, darling?

34:42.481 --> 34:44.483
Sorry, I don't start until
tomorrow.

34:44.516 --> 34:47.418
Come on. Come on. I got a
little secret for you.

34:58.664 --> 35:00.466
You hear anything about...

35:00.499 --> 35:04.336
about that dancer that was
killed... Duffy?

35:04.370 --> 35:06.405
Why? Do you know something
about it?

35:06.438 --> 35:11.443
Well, I know a few things. I
know who killed her.

35:11.477 --> 35:12.378
Who?

35:23.455 --> 35:25.324
Well, maybe you and I should
talk because...

35:25.357 --> 35:27.493
how much is it worth to you?

35:29.628 --> 35:31.397
You don't know anything.

35:31.430 --> 35:34.333
Hey, I know that you're the
girl from "T.V."

35:34.366 --> 35:36.368
(whispers) No, I'm not.

35:36.402 --> 35:39.505
Well, sure you are. See, I'm
good with faces like that.

35:39.538 --> 35:43.575
Yeah, see, you painted it up
different but it's you okay.

35:43.609 --> 35:50.416
All right. Yeah. Hell, maybe I can get
a couple of bucks for a, you know,

35:50.449 --> 35:55.421
a reporter working undercover
as a stripper.

35:55.454 --> 35:58.524
Rusty, damn it. What the heck
are you doing here?

35:58.557 --> 36:02.428
You know you're not supposed to be
taking photographs. Get out of here.

36:02.461 --> 36:05.597
I'm going. All right, I'm going.

36:05.631 --> 36:07.433
Yeah. Go. Go.

36:07.466 --> 36:08.434
You okay?

36:39.298 --> 36:40.466
Who's there?

36:40.499 --> 36:43.535
Hey.

36:43.569 --> 36:47.473
I was going to knock you out,
kid. Sneaking around like that.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.775
You shouldn't have taken that
reporter lady's picture.

36:49.808 --> 36:53.312
It's not polite.

36:53.345 --> 36:56.348
You're not a nice man.

36:56.382 --> 36:58.717
Why don't you mind your own
business, huh?

36:58.750 --> 37:02.354
Get the hell out of here before
I kick your ass.

37:04.656 --> 37:06.592
Yeah, run away.

37:32.318 --> 37:34.486
Feel better?

37:34.520 --> 37:39.525
I'm fine. Just a little amped
up.

37:39.558 --> 37:42.461
Maybe you can get your doctor to
prescribe you something for that.

37:42.494 --> 37:47.433
No pills for me. I'm alert and
that's how I like it.

37:47.466 --> 37:55.507
Good. Because you were right.
My detective friend called me.

37:55.541 --> 37:58.810
Said they don't have any real
leads on your sister's case,

37:58.844 --> 38:03.281
so they're going to treat it
like a robbery gone bad.

38:03.315 --> 38:05.517
But it wasn't.

38:05.551 --> 38:11.122
Yeah. I'm sorry. He did say
though that...

38:11.156 --> 38:11.590
he'd call me if anything
changed.

38:13.392 --> 38:16.595
All right. Thanks.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.497
Anytime.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.510
Tired?

38:31.543 --> 38:35.747
No, not really. Why, what you
got in mind?

38:39.618 --> 38:42.554
This.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.397
I think I thought...

38:51.430 --> 38:55.434
I thought this was what you
wanted, right?

38:55.467 --> 38:57.469
Yeah, it is. But... uh...

38:57.503 --> 39:01.106
Do you got a problem with that?

39:04.309 --> 39:06.478
No.

39:16.422 --> 39:20.526
Oh... she's... she's...

39:39.411 --> 39:43.314
Hey. Hey, hey. You okay?

39:43.348 --> 39:44.450
Yeah.

39:44.483 --> 39:46.452
What's going on?

39:46.485 --> 39:49.354
I just had a nightmare. I'm
fine.

39:49.387 --> 39:52.491
Okay. All right. You sure?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.503
I am so sorry I gotta run.

40:04.536 --> 40:05.471
We got development meetings all
day into the night.

40:05.504 --> 40:07.338
Are you going to be okay?

40:07.372 --> 40:13.311
Yes. I am taking it easy per your
instructions and I feel better already.

40:13.344 --> 40:17.549
Good.

40:17.583 --> 40:19.317
You call me if you need
anything, okay.

40:19.350 --> 40:22.454
Okay.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.442
Hey, Sam. I've been thinking
about you... yes.

40:44.476 --> 40:50.315
Yes. I will. Soon. I promise.

40:50.348 --> 40:52.518
Okay.

40:56.488 --> 40:58.624
I'm afraid I don't have any
good news for you.

40:58.657 --> 41:02.393
There really hasn't been any
change since you were here last.

41:02.427 --> 41:04.429
Nothing at all?

41:04.462 --> 41:07.398
I wish I had something more
reassuring to tell you

41:07.432 --> 41:10.401
but there really isn't anything
else to say.

41:10.435 --> 41:14.540
The trauma is beyond any treatment
that I've been able to prescribe.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.908
We keep waiting for some kind
of breakthrough

41:16.942 --> 41:21.513
and hoping it will happen but I
just don't know when.

41:21.547 --> 41:27.485
No signs, no anything for
months. How can that be?

41:27.519 --> 41:30.656
The mind is an amazing thing.

41:30.689 --> 41:33.458
Sometimes it hangs only by a
thread.

41:33.491 --> 41:36.762
We really don't know why she's
not responding.

41:36.795 --> 41:39.531
But I do believe that she knows
that you're here.

41:39.565 --> 41:42.568
I really thought that after the
operation...

41:42.601 --> 41:46.437
We removed glass fragments from
the brain.

41:46.471 --> 41:48.974
But the impact from the
collision,

41:49.007 --> 41:52.443
it caused damage in other areas
that we're unable to determine.

41:52.477 --> 41:55.380
At least your other sister came
out of it okay.

41:55.413 --> 42:00.318
They always say the drunk driver
has the best chance of survival.

42:00.351 --> 42:03.454
I know your other sister feels
terrible about what happened.

42:03.488 --> 42:06.524
She should. She caused it.

42:06.558 --> 42:08.526
She's lucky she didn't kill
anyone.

42:08.560 --> 42:19.470
Really? Julie's as good as
dead. Now Annie's dead, too.

42:19.504 --> 42:20.639
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

42:24.542 --> 42:29.280
It doesn't matter. Can I see
her now?

42:29.314 --> 42:30.548
Of course.

42:37.522 --> 42:39.625
Hey. Mind if I come in?

42:49.367 --> 42:55.340
So, I just spoke with Doctor Miller
and he says you're doing great.

42:55.373 --> 42:58.509
And it won't be long before you're
up and running around again.

42:58.543 --> 43:03.248
Doesn't that sound fun?

43:03.281 --> 43:09.420
Julie, I hate to bring you bad
news because I don't...

43:09.454 --> 43:13.391
we don't need anymore in our
lives right now.

43:13.424 --> 43:22.333
But there is something very important
I need to tell you. Annie's dead.

43:22.367 --> 43:25.270
Somebody killed her.

43:25.303 --> 43:29.540
It happened a few days ago and
nobody knows who did it.

43:29.574 --> 43:31.376
You know it might have been one
of those

43:31.409 --> 43:34.545
psycho customers at the club
where she dances at or...

43:34.579 --> 43:39.517
or it might have been a drug
deal gone wrong or...

43:39.550 --> 43:41.452
well you know Annie.

43:41.486 --> 43:45.523
She's always up to something
funny.

43:45.556 --> 43:49.294
Anyway, the police aren't
interested

43:49.327 --> 43:51.396
so I'm working at the club
myself to uncover the truth.

43:57.568 --> 44:02.340
I will find Annie's killer. And
when I do...

44:08.579 --> 44:10.415
I just wish I danced better.

44:13.584 --> 44:18.323
I hear the tips aren't bad.

44:27.498 --> 44:29.367
I'll be back as soon as I know
something.

44:32.370 --> 44:33.371
I love you.

44:52.523 --> 44:55.460
I owe this to you, Annie.

44:55.493 --> 44:57.462
No matter what happens

44:57.495 --> 45:00.398
I will find who did this to you.

45:00.431 --> 45:02.868
I promise.

45:06.537 --> 45:10.575
Why do you always look so
worried, Sam?

45:10.608 --> 45:16.281
It's my job to look worried.

45:16.314 --> 45:20.451
What's with the new face? Are
you going out tonight?

45:20.485 --> 45:25.356
Just wanted to get out of my own
skin for a little bit, I guess.

45:25.390 --> 45:33.398
It... it reminds me of your
sister a little bit.

45:33.431 --> 45:38.636
Oh. Really?

45:38.669 --> 45:48.313
Yeah. By the way, how are you
doing with that?

45:48.346 --> 45:54.485
I'm trying really hard to work
through this with her.

45:54.519 --> 45:57.422
What do you mean?

45:57.455 --> 46:01.659
I have seen her.

46:01.692 --> 46:04.562
You mean you've been down to
the police station

46:04.595 --> 46:07.498
so you can identify the body,
right?

46:13.504 --> 46:18.309
That's right.

46:18.343 --> 46:24.349
Look... I saw Ann every so
often... you know.

46:33.424 --> 46:35.360
Why didn't you tell me?

46:35.393 --> 46:43.501
She was going through a lot of
emotional stuff about Julie and...

46:43.534 --> 46:46.571
well, you understand, I...
it's...

46:46.604 --> 46:54.412
it's really not appropriate for me to
talk about it anymore at this time.

46:54.445 --> 47:04.355
Julie?

47:05.590 --> 47:08.493
Why does everybody hide things
from me?

47:19.437 --> 47:21.372
Well, I didn't expect to see
you back here.

47:21.406 --> 47:25.410
I always follow through on my
promises.

47:25.443 --> 47:27.345
That's surprising.

47:27.378 --> 47:30.581
That so?

47:30.615 --> 47:33.551
Especially when it comes to
women.

47:33.584 --> 47:36.321
Are we that predictable?

47:36.354 --> 47:38.656
You're all seeking your daddy's
approval.

47:38.689 --> 47:40.325
You're crazy territorial.

47:40.358 --> 47:42.660
And you all think you're good
girls.

47:42.693 --> 47:46.164
But deep down you got a dark
jacked up,

47:46.197 --> 47:49.867
twisted side that just loves
guys like me.

47:51.336 --> 47:56.441
And what type of guy is that
besides nauseating?

47:56.474 --> 47:58.509
I'm a wolf, baby.

47:58.543 --> 48:00.545
In wolf's clothing.

48:00.578 --> 48:02.547
You got that right.

48:14.525 --> 48:16.327
Who's the new bitch?

48:16.361 --> 48:19.364
Oh, that's Ann. She came in
yesterday.

48:19.397 --> 48:21.532
Well, she's sniffing around my
man and I don't like it.

48:21.566 --> 48:25.403
Whatever, Misty. Who hasn't Pax
tried to bang around here?

48:25.436 --> 48:29.374
I don't care about that, Skank.
He's mine now.

48:29.407 --> 48:33.311
Good. He's a mega-loser.

48:33.344 --> 48:36.381
I'm going to kill you, you know
that?

48:36.414 --> 48:37.482
Try it.

48:37.515 --> 48:44.422
Misty, you're up.

48:44.455 --> 48:47.392
I hope she dies.

48:52.597 --> 48:54.499
I am so glad to see you here.

48:54.532 --> 48:56.567
Thanks.

48:56.601 --> 48:58.536
I'm a little bit nervous.

48:58.569 --> 49:02.307
You know what, I've got a great
idea. Why don't you watch Misty?

49:02.340 --> 49:05.476
She is one of our greatest
dancers.

49:05.510 --> 49:11.349
But... do yourself a favor, try
not to get on her bad side.

49:11.382 --> 49:15.553
Well, actually, I don't even
think she has a good one.

49:20.325 --> 49:24.395
Please welcome to the stage,
the lovely Misty.

50:36.467 --> 50:40.471
No. There's no way I can dance
like that. Maybe if I...

50:40.505 --> 50:44.442
Look, you're here, right? Trust
me. These guys...

50:44.475 --> 50:47.312
they are all going to fall in
love with you.

50:52.550 --> 50:54.485
I'll go get ready now.

50:54.519 --> 50:57.755
All right. You're going to do
good.

51:03.328 --> 51:05.430
New girl seems all right.

51:05.463 --> 51:10.435
Yeah. She asks a lot of
questions, too.

51:22.447 --> 51:25.483
What the hell were you doing
with that new girl?

51:25.516 --> 51:27.552
Just my job.

51:27.585 --> 51:31.422
You know what happened to your
last "new" girl, right?

51:31.456 --> 51:33.358
What the hell is that supposed
to mean?

51:33.391 --> 51:37.428
She's dead. And now this one.

51:50.508 --> 51:54.445
You ready?

51:54.479 --> 51:55.213
No.

51:55.246 --> 51:57.415
Oh, you'll be fine.

51:57.448 --> 52:00.351
This... this just isn't me.

52:00.385 --> 52:07.425
Yeah, we've all said that before. And you
can tell yourself it's all about the money.

52:07.458 --> 52:11.329
But the fact is, there's got to
be a small part of you

52:11.362 --> 52:14.565
that really enjoys it or else
you won't be any good at it.

52:14.599 --> 52:16.334
How is that?

52:16.367 --> 52:21.606
Well, it's the freedom. The
attention.

52:21.639 --> 52:25.443
The feeling of being desired by
someone when you're on the stage

52:25.476 --> 52:28.613
with the lights on you just
doing your thing.

52:28.646 --> 52:32.350
That makes sense, right?

52:32.383 --> 52:34.485
More than you know.

52:34.519 --> 52:37.555
Good. Because you're up next.

52:47.465 --> 52:50.368
And now the Candy Cat is proud
to present our newest dancer.

52:50.401 --> 52:53.504
Let's put our hands together
for Ann.

52:53.538 --> 52:56.541
Guys, be gentle. It's her first
time.

55:15.613 --> 55:17.448
Bravo.

55:17.482 --> 55:20.485
And don't you tell me you had
never done that before.

55:20.518 --> 55:25.255
Yeah. Nice. Now, you've just got
eight more hours of it to go.

55:25.289 --> 55:31.362
Anyways, I'm off early tonight. Got
me a date. I hope he's a nice guy.

55:31.396 --> 55:33.431
He won't be.

55:33.464 --> 55:36.333
He'll take advantage of you
just like all the others,

55:36.367 --> 55:39.437
you brain dead floor mat.

55:43.408 --> 55:46.377
Do you have to be so mean to
everyone?

55:46.411 --> 55:49.447
Yes, I do. Mind your own
business.

55:49.480 --> 55:52.783
I work here now. Get used to it.

55:55.586 --> 56:03.360
Don't challenge me. Don't ever
challenge me.

56:03.394 --> 56:04.361
Where did you get that necklace?

56:04.395 --> 56:05.329
It's mine!

56:05.362 --> 56:06.431
It's not. It's...

56:06.464 --> 56:11.502
What do you mean it's not mine?

56:11.536 --> 56:17.341
You stay the hell away from me,
you freak. I mean it.

56:17.374 --> 56:20.445
I will kill you.

56:20.478 --> 56:23.648
You know, with the cops looking
for a murderer

56:23.681 --> 56:28.653
you might want to lay off that, "I'll
kill you," routine for awhile.

56:55.480 --> 56:57.548
Here's an exotic treat from the
far east...

56:57.582 --> 57:02.587
east Los Angeles. Let's give it
up for Tina.

57:21.639 --> 57:27.578
Oh, hey. Not bad. Not bad at all.
Could use a little polishing

57:27.612 --> 57:29.580
but that's okay because you've
got something...

57:29.614 --> 57:33.283
you've got something so natural
that you can't teach.

57:33.317 --> 57:35.586
Thank you.

57:35.620 --> 57:37.421
You're welcome. Are you ready
to make some money?

57:37.454 --> 57:39.490
Because I have a gentleman over
here who would

57:39.524 --> 57:43.794
like a private dance with the
new girl.

57:47.464 --> 57:51.301
Actually, I don't...

57:51.335 --> 57:53.504
okay.

57:53.538 --> 57:55.540
Good. Come with me. I'll
explain how it works.

58:09.486 --> 58:12.456
This is Julian. He is one of
our best customers.

58:12.489 --> 58:15.359
I guess, Rikki. Thanks.

58:15.392 --> 58:17.261
He's harmless.

58:22.399 --> 58:28.338
So, you want a lap dance.

58:28.372 --> 58:35.445
Uh... yes. Yes, please. Mostly
just talk though if that's okay.

58:35.479 --> 58:38.549
What do you want to talk about?

58:38.583 --> 58:44.454
Um... why you're here. I mean,
why you're really here.

58:44.488 --> 58:46.523
I don't really know what...

58:46.557 --> 58:49.493
You're Constance Turner from
Channel Six.

58:49.526 --> 58:51.295
You do the overnight news.

58:51.328 --> 58:53.530
I don't.

58:53.564 --> 58:58.268
It's okay. It's okay. I'm not
going to say anything.

58:58.302 --> 59:08.378
And neither is Rusty. The guy
who took your picture.

59:08.412 --> 59:13.417
How did you know about that?

59:13.450 --> 59:14.451
I stole his phone.

59:14.484 --> 59:16.486
Why?

59:16.520 --> 59:18.288
I don't want him messing up
what you're doing.

59:35.472 --> 59:37.441
Are you working on a story?

59:37.474 --> 59:43.380
Maybe I can help you, right. I
hear a lot of things around here.

59:43.413 --> 59:46.550
How well did you know Duffy?

59:46.583 --> 59:51.388
She was my favorite. She gave
me things.

59:51.421 --> 59:53.257
What type of things?

59:53.290 --> 01:00:00.430
I'd rather not talk about it.
It's kind of private.

01:00:00.464 --> 01:00:06.470
So what do you want to talk
about?

01:00:06.503 --> 01:00:11.541
I'm not comfortable talking here.
A lot of people overhear things.

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:16.246
If you're interested, call me.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:22.286
Maybe we can go out for dinner.
I mean... my treat.

01:00:27.457 --> 01:00:29.393
All right. I'll call you.

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:56.553
You did really good tonight.

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:58.422
Is it okay if I go now?

01:00:58.455 --> 01:01:00.390
Yeah, of course. We're closed.

01:01:00.424 --> 01:01:05.329
And by the way you did a really, really good
job tonight and I hope you stick around.

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:15.472
Goodnight, all.

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.407
'Night, Tina. I'm going to have
Pax walk you out to your car.

01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:19.409
No, thanks. I'll take my
chances.

01:01:31.355 --> 01:01:32.689
Okay.

01:02:22.372 --> 01:02:23.540
Hey, Quinn.

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:26.476
Hi. I didn't expect you tonight.

01:02:26.510 --> 01:02:28.478
Uh, have you seen John anywhere?

01:02:28.512 --> 01:02:33.517
I thought he was with you. He said he had to
help you with some things about your sister.

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:35.285
Think you'll be back soon?

01:02:35.319 --> 01:02:36.954
They've got me doing the
overnights but you know

01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:39.356
I'm only happy when I'm out in
the field.

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:42.292
Yeah, don't worry. I think I'll
be back soon.

01:02:42.326 --> 01:02:46.463
Oh, good. Hey, do you mind
taking a listen to some copy?

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:50.400
I'm trying to make things sound less stodgy
but I don't think I'm very good at it.

01:02:50.434 --> 01:02:51.401
Yeah, sure. Go for it.

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:53.403
Okay, good.

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:56.406
Police report another murder downtown
as the body of Russell Barnes

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:59.643
was found in the back alley not
far from the Candy Cat Lounge,

01:02:59.676 --> 01:03:04.281
the scene of a gruesome murder
just days ago.

01:03:04.314 --> 01:03:07.551
Oh, I'm sorry, Constance. I
totally forgot.

01:03:07.584 --> 01:03:11.455
What happened to the guy?

01:03:11.488 --> 01:03:13.357
He was strangled.

01:03:32.509 --> 01:03:33.477
Ah! (screams)

01:03:33.510 --> 01:03:34.511
Whoa, what are you doing here?

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.413
Where have you been?

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:38.448
Just now? I was taking care of
some business.

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:40.450
Quinn said you were with me.

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:43.387
Quinn's a bubble head. Now,
what's going on with you?

01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:46.456
I've been seeing Ann's life.
Like I don't know how.

01:03:46.490 --> 01:03:49.559
I can't tell you how, but all I know
is that police aren't doing anything.

01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:51.428
Did you go to the Candy Cat?

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:56.566
One of the dancers had her
necklace. And a gun.

01:03:56.600 --> 01:03:58.402
You know that place is
dangerous.

01:03:58.435 --> 01:04:00.437
I had to for Ann's sake.

01:04:00.470 --> 01:04:02.372
Ann is dead.

01:04:02.406 --> 01:04:05.375
Now, you know how crazy you
sound right now?

01:04:05.409 --> 01:04:07.544
I thought you understood, but I
see you don't.

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.379
Yeah, no kidding.

01:04:09.413 --> 01:04:11.448
Hey, there's been another
murder downtown.

01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:15.519
Another dancer at the Candy
Cat... Tina somebody.

01:04:15.552 --> 01:04:17.521
Suffocated.

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:45.582
Oh, my God.

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:48.418
You stay away from me, okay.

01:04:48.452 --> 01:04:51.488
You're dead! You're dead!

01:05:56.586 --> 01:05:58.388
You're not the delivery guy.

01:05:58.422 --> 01:06:01.525
I know.

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:03.527
I'm calling the police.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.396
Go ahead, kid. Call them.

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:08.398
I'm sure the police would be
very interested about

01:06:08.432 --> 01:06:11.535
your involvement in a string of
murders at the Candy Cat.

01:06:11.568 --> 01:06:14.571
I'm not involved with that.

01:06:14.604 --> 01:06:18.508
This says you are.

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:20.544
How did you get that?

01:06:20.577 --> 01:06:25.482
None of your business. And what my
business is is keeping Constance safe.

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:29.919
So are you seeing her or ever
have anything to do with her,

01:06:29.953 --> 01:06:35.392
it's not going to happen ever
again.

01:06:35.425 --> 01:06:36.526
Did she...

01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:40.464
Did she send you here?

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:46.270
I'm looking out for her.

01:06:46.303 --> 01:06:52.542
You see, she's mine. Not yours.

01:06:52.576 --> 01:06:55.812
And if I ever have to come back
here again for anything

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:59.416
I'm going to hurt you.

01:06:59.449 --> 01:07:04.388
I'm going to hurt you very bad.
Do you understand?

01:07:04.421 --> 01:07:05.422
Yes.

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:07.724
Good.

01:07:07.757 --> 01:07:12.496
So you stay away from her and you
stay away from the Candy Cat.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:17.234
And maybe you won't be the next
victim.

01:07:17.267 --> 01:07:19.336
Don't hurt Constance.

01:07:19.369 --> 01:07:26.610
Hey! You stay away from her or
I will eat your face!

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:29.446
You got it? Do you got it?

01:07:29.479 --> 01:07:30.414
Yes.

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:37.654
(laughs) Good. Lock your door.

01:07:37.687 --> 01:07:40.457
A lot of bad folks out there.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:54.504
(Answering Machine Greeting)
This is Doctor Samuel Hubbard.

01:07:54.538 --> 01:07:57.407
I'm not in the office at the
moment but please leave a message.

01:07:57.441 --> 01:08:01.511
If it's an emergency, please
hang up and dial nine-one-one.

01:08:01.545 --> 01:08:05.482
Doctor Hubbard, it's a friend
of Constance Turner.

01:08:05.515 --> 01:08:08.385
I don't know what you've been
telling her,

01:08:08.418 --> 01:08:10.120
or what kind of thoughts you've
been filling her head

01:08:10.154 --> 01:08:13.457
with but she's in a very bad
way right now.

01:08:13.490 --> 01:08:18.094
And I'm holding you personally
responsible,

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:19.529
you got that?

01:08:27.636 --> 01:08:29.439
I can't believe this.

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:33.877
I have worked so hard to make
this place what it is

01:08:33.910 --> 01:08:37.381
and somebody is killing all my
people.

01:08:37.413 --> 01:08:39.416
Didn't you talk to the police
yet?

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:43.453
Yes. I've talked to them twice.
Twice.

01:08:43.487 --> 01:08:49.326
I need somebody to find the son-of-a-bitch
and just freaking bury him.

01:08:49.359 --> 01:08:52.261
Maybe I can help you.

01:08:52.296 --> 01:08:56.466
Maybe you can. You hear a lot of things
that go around this place, don't you?

01:08:56.500 --> 01:08:58.301
I do.

01:08:58.335 --> 01:09:01.470
All right, great. Then why don't you tell
me and start from the very beginning.

01:09:04.474 --> 01:09:06.443
Somebody came to my apartment
today.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:09.513
Hey, junior. Thought I'd find
you here.

01:09:11.314 --> 01:09:12.582
You run this place?

01:09:12.616 --> 01:09:14.451
Who are you?

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:16.353
I want Constance. Would she
happen to be here?

01:09:16.386 --> 01:09:18.455
I... I'm sorry. Who?

01:09:18.488 --> 01:09:20.490
Look, I'm real sorry about what's
been going on in your club.

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:26.563
But Constance... she's sick and
her coming here doing...

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:32.569
well, whatever it is she's doing, it's
making her paranoid and delusional.

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:36.372
So I came by to tell you that
she has to get away from it.

01:09:36.406 --> 01:09:42.312
Really? Because every time I see her here
she's open, she's free and she's happy.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:47.584
So if there's anybody that she probably
needs to stay away from... it's you.

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:51.421
You want a lawsuit? You want a Channel
Six news story about what a dive...

01:09:51.455 --> 01:09:54.624
what a dump this place is just
keep talking.

01:09:54.658 --> 01:09:59.062
You know, I should probably tell
you that I have been threatened

01:09:59.095 --> 01:10:02.399
by much bigger and better
people than you.

01:10:02.432 --> 01:10:09.473
So why don't you do us all a favor, turn around,
walk out my door and never come back again.

01:10:09.506 --> 01:10:14.344
Unless, of course, you want a
lap dance from your girlfriend.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:20.350
You got no idea who you're
messing with, lady.

01:10:23.553 --> 01:10:27.591
And you have no idea who you're
dealing with.

01:10:41.438 --> 01:10:45.442
Holy cow, Rikki. That was
badass.

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:50.414
Everybody's a tough guy until
they meet my little friend.

01:10:59.589 --> 01:11:06.262
I brought you an ice cream.
It's your favorite flavor.

01:11:06.296 --> 01:11:11.301
What do you say?

01:11:11.335 --> 01:11:16.406
All right, then.

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:24.481
Mmm. You know, I really
shouldn't be eating this.

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:31.388
Once you start dancing naked
you've got to watch your weight.

01:11:31.421 --> 01:11:35.359
Things have gotten very
complicated, Julie.

01:11:35.392 --> 01:11:42.632
People keep getting killed and I don't
know if they're the right people or not.

01:11:42.666 --> 01:11:50.507
I mean one of them's got to be guilty,
right? I mean what are the chances?

01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:57.313
I... I just... I don't know
what to do anymore.

01:11:57.347 --> 01:12:01.618
I'm afraid to leave you alone.

01:12:01.651 --> 01:12:06.623
I mean what would become of you
if something happened to me.

01:12:06.656 --> 01:12:15.331
I can't leave you alone with these
strangers. It just wouldn't be right.

01:12:15.365 --> 01:12:19.469
You've got to know that...

01:12:19.503 --> 01:12:25.775
know how much I love you more
than anything.

01:12:34.384 --> 01:12:38.588
I love you this much.

01:12:48.432 --> 01:12:54.471
Oh, no. I'm sorry. I'm so
sorry.

01:12:55.439 --> 01:12:58.508
Don't cry. I am so sorry.

01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:16.426
(Answering Machine Greeting)
You have one new message..

01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:20.430
(Answering Machine Message) Doctor Hubbard,
it's a friend of Constance Turner.

01:13:20.464 --> 01:13:22.566
I don't know what you've been
telling her,

01:13:22.599 --> 01:13:25.201
or what kind of thoughts you've
been filling her head with

01:13:25.234 --> 01:13:27.537
but she's in a very bad way
right now.

01:13:27.571 --> 01:13:32.008
And I'm holding you personally
responsible,

01:13:32.041 --> 01:13:33.409
you got that?

01:13:33.443 --> 01:13:35.612
Yeah, I got it.

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:44.353
So, you can see how everything has
gotten so complicated that the only

01:13:44.387 --> 01:13:52.395
real solution is to make sure that every
"I" is dotted and "T" is... is crossed.

01:13:52.428 --> 01:13:53.897
Now, that creates more
complications, of course,

01:13:53.930 --> 01:14:00.236
but I feel confident that I
will rise to the task.

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:10.480
I mean so far so good, right?
Oh, what's the matter? Mmm?

01:14:10.514 --> 01:14:15.485
No more words of advice.

01:14:15.519 --> 01:14:22.325
No more telling me every move
to make.

01:14:22.358 --> 01:14:27.296
No more spying on me. No?

01:14:27.330 --> 01:14:29.566
Well, good.

01:14:29.599 --> 01:14:35.739
Because I have had it up to
here with everybody

01:14:35.772 --> 01:14:38.542
just treating me like I'm some
kind of child,

01:14:38.575 --> 01:14:43.046
I mean... sorry I'm rambling.
(laughs) Oh.

01:14:47.651 --> 01:14:51.655
So, I've got some things I have
to tidy up

01:14:51.688 --> 01:14:57.627
so if you'll excuse me I have a
late show to get ready for.

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:09.539
There's someone here to see
you, Julie.

01:15:09.573 --> 01:15:11.541
I don't know what you're
expecting

01:15:11.575 --> 01:15:15.278
but this girl hasn't spoken
since she was operated on.

01:15:15.311 --> 01:15:18.615
I understand that. But this
point I don't have a choice.

01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:33.529
Julie, Constance is in big
trouble... really big trouble.

01:15:33.563 --> 01:15:40.503
And I want to help her but I
can't find her.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:45.308
Do you know where she is?

01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:50.546
Julie, if you know anything
you've got to try to help us.

01:16:02.391 --> 01:16:04.594
Thank you.

01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:28.551
What are you doing here,
Constance?

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:31.454
What does it look like I'm
doing?

01:16:31.487 --> 01:16:36.459
I'm picking out my costume for
tonight's show.

01:16:36.492 --> 01:16:39.562
The club is closed. There's no
one here.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:44.500
They'll come. They always come.

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:49.438
They'll come to see me.

01:16:49.472 --> 01:16:51.440
No one's coming, Constance.

01:16:51.474 --> 01:16:54.443
And stop calling me Constance.

01:16:54.477 --> 01:16:57.513
She's such a drag, man.

01:16:57.546 --> 01:17:00.316
Who are you? Annie?

01:17:00.349 --> 01:17:02.418
You're funny.

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:07.623
All that money I paid you to straighten
me out and you still don't know who I am.

01:17:09.458 --> 01:17:11.127
Where's Constance?

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.062
I don't know.

01:17:13.096 --> 01:17:17.466
Maybe she's dead. Maybe I
killed her.

01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:24.407
Annie, you need help. Let me
help you.

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:28.144
Help me? Like you helped my
sister?

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:32.816
I don't think so, Sam.

01:17:36.419 --> 01:17:38.287
You're fired.

01:18:04.380 --> 01:18:05.681
Oh, my God.

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:20.456
Constance?

01:19:25.494 --> 01:19:28.464
Did you kill me, Julian?

01:19:28.497 --> 01:19:33.502
Kill you? I didn't kill anybody.

01:19:33.536 --> 01:19:36.572
You're the only one left.

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:40.509
How do you explain that?

01:19:40.543 --> 01:19:43.646
I think you killed them,
Constance.

01:19:43.679 --> 01:19:47.550
I think you killed your own
sister.

01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:53.556
And then you killed everybody you thought
was responsible for what she'd become.

01:19:53.589 --> 01:19:57.493
Don't call me Constance!

01:19:57.526 --> 01:20:01.464
Why not? Mmm?

01:20:01.497 --> 01:20:04.400
Because Constance can't live
with what she's done?

01:20:04.433 --> 01:20:05.534
My name is Annie.

01:20:05.568 --> 01:20:08.537
Annie! Say it!

01:20:08.571 --> 01:20:12.575
All right. Annie.

01:20:12.608 --> 01:20:14.410
Okay, now what?

01:20:21.517 --> 01:20:24.353
First round's on me.

01:20:30.493 --> 01:20:36.365
Sorry for dragging this out.
I'm usually a better shot.

01:20:40.269 --> 01:20:43.606
What the hell is going on
around here?

01:20:43.639 --> 01:20:46.409
I knew I was forgetting someone.

01:20:59.422 --> 01:21:03.526
(laughs) Yeah, everybody's a tough guy
until they meet my little friend.

01:21:06.429 --> 01:21:08.497
Oh, my Gosh. Come on get up.
Get up on your feet.

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:11.567
You're ruining my carpet.

01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:14.437
Thank you. You saved my life.

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:17.506
Well, maybe you should stop
hanging out at joints like this.

01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:19.342
You might live longer.

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.344
I swear I'm swearing... I'm
swearing off strippers. Okay.

01:21:21.377 --> 01:21:25.381
I just want a real relationship
and make it last.

01:21:25.414 --> 01:21:27.483
Sorry. Come on.
