(crack)
FEEL BETTER?

00:02.336 --> 00:04.205
(exhales deeply)
THAT FEELS BETTER THAN BETTER.

00:04.238 --> 00:05.539
FEELS LIKE I CAN DO THIS.

playing)

00:09.510 --> 00:12.513
(Tessa)
FRIDAY NIGHT IN CHATSWIN,

00:12.546 --> 00:15.816
AND A REALLY DUMB CHARITY EVENT
FOR A REALLY DUMB CHARITY

00:15.849 --> 00:18.352
MEANT INSTEAD OF SEEING
MY NEW BOYFRIEND,

00:18.386 --> 00:20.621
SCOTT STRAUSS, I WAS FORCED
TO WATCH PARENTS DANCE

00:20.654 --> 00:23.424
WITH THEIR CHILDREN
TO "ROCK LOBSTER."

00:23.457 --> 00:25.126
I JUST DON'T THINK
IT'S NORMAL

00:25.159 --> 00:27.161
FOR PARENTS TO HANG OUT
WITH THEIR KIDS THIS MUCH.

00:27.195 --> 00:30.098
WELL, MY MOM SAYS THAT
SHE'S MY ONLY TRUE FRIEND

00:30.131 --> 00:31.432
AND THAT I SHOULD TELL HER
EVERYTHING.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.600
AND DO YOU?

00:32.633 --> 00:35.169
I DO, AND SOMETIMES
SHE NODS OFF, BUT...

00:35.203 --> 00:36.036
WELL, I'M A PRIVATE PERSON.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.406
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
KNOWING MY BUSINESS.

00:38.439 --> 00:40.508
(glass clinks)
(amplified voice)
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

00:40.541 --> 00:42.343
I'VE JUST BEEN TOLD
BY THE DAVENPORTS

00:42.376 --> 00:45.079
THAT AMANDA GOT
HER FIRST PERIOD TODAY.

00:45.113 --> 00:48.282

00:48.316 --> 00:49.150
(Fred, amplified voice)
ATTAGIRL!

00:49.183 --> 00:50.551
JUST WANTED TO SHARE
THAT NEWS WITH YOU.

00:50.584 --> 00:53.654
AMANDA IS MENSTRUATING.
MAZEL TOV, MANDI.

00:53.687 --> 00:54.788
MAZEL TOV.

00:54.822 --> 00:58.259
THERE'S A REAL SENSE
OF COMMUNITY.

BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

01:20.514 --> 01:22.483
ACCORDING TO ALAN,
THERE'S NO SUCH THING

01:22.516 --> 01:24.818
AS BEING OPENLY GAY
IN CHATSWIN.

01:24.852 --> 01:26.454
ANYTIME WE GO OUT TOGETHER,

01:26.487 --> 01:28.689
HE'S CONVINCED
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING US.

01:28.722 --> 01:30.491
PEOPLE ARE WATCHING YOU.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.933
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS DO
SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF CHATSWIN?

01:39.967 --> 01:41.535
AT LEAST YOU HAVE
THE OPTION.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.271
THAT'S--THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO
IF I WERE YOU.

01:43.304 --> 01:45.773
(clinks)

01:45.806 --> 01:46.674
(song ends)

01:46.707 --> 01:49.277
THANK YOU, CHATSWINIANS.

01:49.310 --> 01:51.612
LIVING IN A WAR-TORN COUNTRY

01:51.645 --> 01:55.949
CAN PUT AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT
OF STRAIN ON THE LUMBAR REGION.

01:55.983 --> 02:01.455
NOW WITH YOUR HELP, THE C.W.B.
CAN CORRECT SPINAL ALIGNMENT

02:01.489 --> 02:04.958
REGARDLESS
OF POLITICAL ALIGNMENT.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.794
TAKE A LOOK.

02:06.827 --> 02:08.862
BORING! RAFFLE!

02:08.896 --> 02:11.599
CAN WE GET THE RAFFLE
GOING?

02:11.632 --> 02:14.335
OKAY. I KNOW WE'RE ALL ANXIOUS
TO GET TO THIS,

02:14.368 --> 02:17.571
SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO,
LET'S RAFFLE OFF

02:17.605 --> 02:20.974
THE ALL-EXPENSE-PAID TRIP
TO ATLANTIC CITY!

02:21.008 --> 02:23.644
JERSEY, BABY!

02:23.677 --> 02:24.678
WHEN I WIN,
YOU'RE COMING WITH ME.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.181
WE'RE FINALLY GONNA HAVE
A PROPER GUYS' NIGHT OUT.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.449
OH, WHAT ARE YOU--
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.284
WE JUST SAW "300" TOGETHER.

02:30.318 --> 02:31.619
"300" WAS LIKE
A MILLION YEARS AGO,

02:31.652 --> 02:32.653
AND IT WAS A MATINEE.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.722
AND I TREATED YOU
TO SNO-CAPS.

02:34.755 --> 02:38.359
OF WHICH I HAD THREE. YOU WERE
SAVING THE REST FOR TESSA.

02:38.392 --> 02:41.195
SHE LIKES SNO-CAPS.
SO DO I, GEORGE. ALL RIGHT?

02:41.229 --> 02:42.930
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE SO BUSY
BEING FATHER OF THE YEAR,

02:42.963 --> 02:44.632
YOU FORGET TO BE
FRIEND OF THE NOAH...

02:44.665 --> 02:45.699
OF THE YEAR.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.568
(Fred) GET YOUR TICKETS READY,
EVERYBODY. HERE WE GO.

02:56.644 --> 02:59.347
(microphone thuds)
(amplified voice) AHEM.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.914
4...

03:00.948 --> 03:02.716
7...

03:02.750 --> 03:04.518
3-TEEN.

03:04.552 --> 03:06.019
I BELIEVE IT'S PRONOUNCED
"THIRTEEN."

03:06.053 --> 03:08.489
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T CRITICIZE
YOUR STUPID SPEECH.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.857
(George) HEY!

03:09.890 --> 03:11.592
HA HA! YEAH! I GOT IT!
(crowd murmuring)

03:11.625 --> 03:12.693
I WON!
WE HAVE A WINNER.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.528
(George laughs) YEAH.
(scattered applause)

03:14.562 --> 03:17.465
GREAT. PERFECT. I'M SURE YOU
AND TESSA WILL HAVE A BLAST.

03:17.498 --> 03:18.899
OH, COME ON.
DON'T BE A BABY.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.834
NO, NO. I'M SURE
THAT SHE'LL APPRECIATE

03:20.868 --> 03:23.237
THE ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT PRIME RIB
AND DON RICKLES.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.406
NOAH, WOULD YOU DO ME
THE HONOR OF ACCOMPANYING ME

03:25.439 --> 03:26.640
TO ATLANTIC CITY?

03:26.674 --> 03:28.776
WE CAN DO OUR--
OUR GUYS' NIGHT OUT.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.244
ALL THE SNO-CAPS
YOU CAN EAT.

03:30.278 --> 03:31.612
(thud)
DON'T TOY WITH ME.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.681
NOR ME. GENTLEMEN,
DID I HEAR SOMETHING

03:33.714 --> 03:37.285
ABOUT A GUYS' NIGHT OUT?
FOR I STAND BEFORE YOU, A GUY.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.352
PISS OFF, FRED.

03:38.386 --> 03:39.920
OH, COME ON.
THE ROOM SLEEPS SIX.

03:39.953 --> 03:40.988
IF WE'RE GONNA DO THIS,

03:41.021 --> 03:43.391
THE MORE, THE MERRIER, RIGHT?
THE MORE, THE MERRIER?

03:43.424 --> 03:45.326
ALEX AND I WOULD LOVE,
LOVE, LOVE THE CHANCE

03:45.359 --> 03:46.894
TO ESCAPE
OUR OLD BALLS AND CHAINS.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.763
SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO GET
DOWN WITH YOUR HOMEBOYS.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.432
(imitates B-Real) WHO YOU
TRYING TO GET CRAZY WITH, ESE?

03:51.465 --> 03:54.067
DON'T YOU KNOW I'M LOCO?

03:54.101 --> 03:55.436
(normal voice)
THAT'S A CYPRESS HILL REFERENCE

03:55.469 --> 03:57.405
FOR THE UNINITIATED. (chuckles)

03:57.438 --> 03:59.940
FRED, DON'T YOU HAVE TO CHECK
WITH SHEILA FIRST?

03:59.973 --> 04:01.409
(sighs) YOU MAY NOT
REALIZE THIS, NOAH,

04:01.442 --> 04:04.044
BUT I HAVE SHEILA IN CHECK.
(chuckles)

04:04.077 --> 04:05.679
(voice breaking)
IT'S BAD, SHEILA.

04:05.713 --> 04:07.281
IT'S REAL BAD.

04:07.315 --> 04:08.949
IT'S--IT'S LOOKING LIKE
SHE MIGHT NOT MAKE IT.

04:08.982 --> 04:12.486
OH, POOR AUNT ELAINE.
BLESS HER HEART.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.788
(gasps) I KNOW HOW DEAR
SHE IS TO YOU.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.524
(whispers)
OH, SHE'S VERY DEAR.

04:16.557 --> 04:18.392
THE MOST DEAR.

04:18.426 --> 04:19.793
AND IF I DON'T RUSH
TO HER SIDE,

04:19.827 --> 04:21.995
SHE MAY NOT HAVE A SIDE
TO RUSH TO.

04:22.029 --> 04:25.299
OH, FRED.
YOUR FAVORITE AUNT.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.901
OH, COME HERE.
LET ME ROCK YOU.

04:27.935 --> 04:30.338
LET ME ROCK YOU.

04:30.371 --> 04:34.542
OHH.

04:34.575 --> 04:37.445
FRED, DID I JUST FEEL YOU
GIVE THE THUMBS UP?

04:37.478 --> 04:38.679
OKAY, THIS--THIS IS NOT ONE

04:38.712 --> 04:40.113
OF THOSE "RISKY BUSINESS"
TYPE SITUATIONS

04:40.147 --> 04:41.815
WHERE YOU DANCE AROUND
IN YOUR UNDERWEAR,

04:41.849 --> 04:42.883
AND THEN YOU HAVE
A FEW FRIENDS OVER,

04:42.916 --> 04:44.318
AND SUDDENLY
YOU START A BROTHEL

04:44.352 --> 04:45.719
AND WIND UP SINGING
ON A FLOAT IN A PARADE.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.688
DAD, YOU'RE--
YOU'RE MIXING TEEN MOVIES.

04:47.721 --> 04:50.591
THIS IS MORE LIKE AN EPISODE
OF "LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE"

04:50.624 --> 04:52.360
WHERE PA GOES OFF
TO THE MERCANTILE,

04:52.393 --> 04:54.428
AND I STAY HOME
TO LOOM YOU SOME PANTS.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.096
PERFECT. I'M A 32 LONG.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.898
BUT SERIOUSLY, NO PARTIES.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.700
IT'S BEEN SAID,
AND YOU HEARD IT.
OKAY.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.968
OKAY, YOU HAVE
MY CELL PHONE NUMBER.

05:01.001 --> 05:02.135
UH, I LEFT THE NUMBER
OF THE HOTEL

05:02.169 --> 05:05.038
IN CASE ANYTHING GOES WRONG.
WHAT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG?

05:05.072 --> 05:06.707
DAD.

05:06.740 --> 05:08.108
THIS IS CHATSWIN.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.777
NOTHING GOES WRONG
IN CHATSWIN.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.579
ISN'T THAT THE WHOLE REASON
PEOPLE LIVE HERE?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.119
(door opens)

05:19.152 --> 05:20.721
BUT WITH ANY LUCK,

05:20.754 --> 05:22.423
SCOTT AND I
WERE GOING TO GO WRONG

05:22.456 --> 05:23.991
IN EVERY ROOM OF THIS HOUSE.

05:27.395 --> 05:31.632
(Cypress Hill's
"Insane in the Brain" playing)

05:31.665 --> 05:33.934
* TO THE ONE
ON THE FLAMBOYANT TEMPER *

05:33.967 --> 05:36.069
* I JUST TOSS THAT HAM
IN THE FRYING PAN *

05:36.103 --> 05:38.806
* LIKE SPAM, IT'S DONE
WHEN I COME IN, SLAM *

05:38.839 --> 05:40.808
* DAMN, I FEEL LIKE
THE SON OF SAM *

05:40.841 --> 05:41.742
(record needle scratches,
music stops)

05:41.775 --> 05:42.776
OH.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.849
(laughs)
HEY, ALL RIGHT.

05:48.882 --> 05:52.553
YOU GUYS, WE ARE GOING TO
PARTY LIKE IT'S OUR BIRTHDAYS.
WHOO!

05:52.586 --> 05:55.589
(clink)
ADD A RASPBERRY, GEORGE.
YOU'LL THANK ME.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.791
DON'T MIND IF I DO. THANKS FOR
GUILTING ME INTO THIS, MAN.

05:57.825 --> 05:59.059
I DON'T DO THIS KIND
OF THING ENOUGH.

05:59.092 --> 06:01.562
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

06:01.595 --> 06:03.931
THIS IS GONNA BE... (mouth full)
A LOT OF FUN, HMM? (laughs)
(clink)

06:09.002 --> 06:10.704
FRED?

06:10.738 --> 06:13.140
OH, UH, GAMBLING IS HAPPENING.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.509
GAMBLING IS HAPPENING
IN THIS BUILDING.

06:15.543 --> 06:17.745
I'M SO CLOSE TO THE GAMBLING.

06:17.778 --> 06:20.080
WH-WHAT'S GOING ON?
OH! NOW I REMEMBER.

06:20.113 --> 06:22.750
FRED HAS A REALLY SERIOUS
GAMBLING PROBLEM.

06:22.783 --> 06:24.752
THIS IS BAD.
I'M SWEATY AND NERVOUS

06:24.785 --> 06:26.153
AND A LITTLE BIT HORNY.

06:26.186 --> 06:27.688
ALL RIGHT, BUDDY.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.923
HEY, RELAX.
OKAY.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.860
IT'S GONNA BE FINE.
HAVE SOME CHAMPAGNE.
OKAY.

06:32.893 --> 06:34.695
THANK YOU.
HERE YOU GO.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.497
(chuckles) I'M TREMBLING.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.131
I'M GONNA GAMBLE
ALL MY MONEY.

06:38.165 --> 06:39.767
YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA
GAMBLE AND TREMBLE

06:39.800 --> 06:41.769
UNTIL I LOSE ALL MY MONEY.
THAT'S WHAT... (gulps)

06:41.802 --> 06:43.671
MAYBE I SHOULD TAKE THAT,
ACTUALLY.

06:43.704 --> 06:45.739
FRED, YOU CAN HAVE FUN
WITHOUT GAMBLING.

06:45.773 --> 06:48.241
JUST DON'T GAMBLE.
WE WON'T LET YOU GAMBLE.

06:48.275 --> 06:51.645
OKAY. (inhales deeply)

06:51.679 --> 06:52.913
UH... NOW, UH,

06:52.946 --> 06:55.949
THIS PILE IS FOR BLACK.
THIS PILE IS FOR RED.

06:55.983 --> 06:58.519
CAN'T LOSE THAT WAY. (chuckles)
NOW SLOTS ARE FOR FOOLS,

06:58.552 --> 07:00.020
BUT I'LL TAKE A STAB AT 'EM.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.255
(clinking)

07:02.289 --> 07:03.857
FRED, LET US HELP YOU--

07:03.891 --> 07:05.493
DON'T TOUCH MY MONEY, BITCH!

07:05.526 --> 07:09.763
OKAY. REMAIN CALM.
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.264
FRED, TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.566
YEAH.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.969
(inhales and exhales deeply)

07:16.003 --> 07:18.672
OKAY. OKAY.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.140
IT'S FRED. (chuckles)

07:20.173 --> 07:22.142
FRED'S BACK. (chuckles)
SORRY.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.211
I WENT A LITTLE NUTS THERE.
THANK YOU.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.146
WHY DON'T YOU, UH,
WHY DON'T YOU GET FRESHENED UP?

07:26.179 --> 07:28.215
SPLASH SOME WATER ON YOUR FACE.
PUT ON A DIFFERENT SHIRT.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.718
YOU LOOK A LITTLE CLAMMY.
CHANGE THOSE SHORTS.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.185
(whispers) SHORTS. OKAY.

07:32.219 --> 07:33.654
(normal voice) THANK YOU.

07:33.687 --> 07:34.822
THANK YOU, YOU GUYS.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.224
I REALLY...

07:37.257 --> 07:39.793
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW...

07:39.827 --> 07:44.297
I FEEL INCREDIBLY CLOSE
TO YOU ALL RIGHT NOW.

07:44.331 --> 07:47.034
BUT I WILL SLASH YOUR FACE...

07:47.067 --> 07:49.570
IN ORDER TO GAMBLE.

07:49.603 --> 07:52.005
(chuckles)

07:52.039 --> 07:53.140
(door closes)

07:53.173 --> 07:55.943
YOU CAN'T SEDUCE SCOTT IN THAT.
IT HAS TOO MANY BUTTONS.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.946
DON'T WEAR ANYTHING
TOO COMPLICATED.

07:58.979 --> 08:01.515
YEAH. IF SCOTT AND I
DON'T MAKE IT

08:01.549 --> 08:03.050
PAST THE HAND-HOLDING STAGE--

08:03.083 --> 08:06.654
YOU WILL LOSE HIM.
CORRECT.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.255
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE GONNA BE
DOING A LOT MORE TONIGHT

08:08.288 --> 08:09.857
THAN WE'RE COMFORTABLE WITH.

08:09.890 --> 08:10.758
"WE"?

08:10.791 --> 08:13.961
WE'RE GONNA GIVE SCOTT
EVERYTHING WE HAVE,

08:13.994 --> 08:15.829
EVEN THE THINGS
THAT HURT.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.169
WHAT IS THAT?

08:22.202 --> 08:23.737
IT'S MY LOVE BOX,

08:23.771 --> 08:25.673
AND I AM LENDING IT TO YOU
FOR TONIGHT.

08:28.976 --> 08:31.011
OH. (chuckles) OKAY.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.880
(blows raspberry)

08:32.913 --> 08:36.283
LISA, I THINK YOU HAVE
THE WRONG IDEA ABOUT TONIGHT.

08:36.316 --> 08:38.686
I WAS PLANNING ON
KEEPING IT SYRUP-FREE.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.921
JUST AN OLD SCHOOL
MAKE-OUT SESH.

08:40.954 --> 08:43.156
TESSA,
YOU SOUND LIKE A FOOL.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.759
SCOTT'S AN OLDER GUY
WITH OLDER GUY NEEDS.

08:45.793 --> 08:48.328
HE'S BEEN TO AFRICA.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.130
AFRICA.

08:50.163 --> 08:53.300
HE'S GONNA WANNA GO TRIBAL
ON YOU.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.168
ARE YOU SURE
THAT'S NOT OFFENSIVE?

08:55.202 --> 08:59.940
(bells dinging)

08:59.973 --> 09:02.843
(strained voice) LOOK HOW
SHE'S LOOKING AT ME, GEORGE.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.778
DIRTY GIRL.

09:04.812 --> 09:07.147
HEY, HAVE YOU EATEN?
CAN I BUY YOU A BURGER?

09:07.180 --> 09:09.382
HERE.

09:09.416 --> 09:13.621
(sighs)

09:13.654 --> 09:15.288
HAVEN'T HEARD
FROM THE LITTLE ONE, HUH?

09:15.322 --> 09:17.324
YEAH, SHE'LL CHECK IN WITH ME.
I'M NOT GONNA HOUND HER.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.929
SHE'S PROBABLY
HIGH AS A KITE RIGHT NOW

09:21.962 --> 09:24.097
AND MAKING LOVE
TO A TRINIDADIAN MAN.

09:24.131 --> 09:26.399
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK, FRED.
YOU'RE NOT GONNA SCARE ME OFF.

09:26.433 --> 09:28.869
WHY WOULD I SCARE YOU OFF?
THERE'S NOTHING TO BE SCARED OF.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.904
TESSA'S PERFECTLY TRUSTWORTHY.

09:30.938 --> 09:32.372
(coins clinking)

09:32.405 --> 09:34.975
I'M SURE YOU WERE, TOO,
AT THAT AGE.

09:35.008 --> 09:37.678
(bell ringing,
indistinct conversations)

09:37.711 --> 09:38.946
YOU THINK IT'D BE WEIRD
IF I HAD DALLAS STOP IN,

09:38.979 --> 09:40.213
CHECK IN ON HER?

09:40.247 --> 09:41.982
NO, NOT AT ALL.

09:42.015 --> 09:44.384
WHEW! NICE WORKOUT THERE,
SHEILA.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.953
BETWEEN
YOUR UNSTOPPABLE BACKHAND

09:45.986 --> 09:47.354
AND MY DILIGENCE
AT THE NET,

09:47.387 --> 09:50.157
WE ARE GONNA DOMINATE
THE MID-MORNING WINTER LEAGUE.

09:50.190 --> 09:52.793
(cell phone rings)
OH. HEY, GEORGE!

09:52.826 --> 09:54.261
HEY. YOU GOT A SECOND?

09:54.294 --> 09:56.063
YEAH. WHAT'S CRACK-A-LACKIN'?

09:56.096 --> 09:59.066
OH, NOTHIN'. UH, IT'S JUST
THAT TESSA IS HOME ALONE

09:59.099 --> 10:02.269
FOR THE WEEKEND,
AND I'M... A LITTLE NERVOUS

10:02.302 --> 10:05.072
SHE MIGHT CAVE
AND THROW A PARTY OR SOMETHING.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.173
Oh, my gosh.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.008
I HOPE SHE INVITES ME
IF SHE DOES.

10:08.041 --> 10:10.811
NO, NO, WE DON'T WANT
AN UNCHAPERONED PARTY.

10:10.844 --> 10:12.746
IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T TRUST HER. I DO.

10:12.780 --> 10:16.884
I JUST--WELL, I-I-I'D LIKE YOU
TO CHECK ON HER FOR ME.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.152
WELL, IT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE YOU TRUST HER.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.088
WHO IS THAT? IS THAT FRED?

10:21.121 --> 10:23.090
W-WELL, I'LL TRUST HER
A LOT MORE

10:23.123 --> 10:24.825
ONCE I KNOW FOR SURE
NOTHING'S GOING ON.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.895
LISTEN, GEORGE, I CONSIDER TESSA
TO BE ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS,

10:27.928 --> 10:30.664
AND YOU ARE PUTTING ME
IN A DIFFICULT SPOT.

10:30.698 --> 10:32.299
COME ON, DALLAS.
Well...

10:32.332 --> 10:34.101
STEVEN IS IN SINGAPORE
THIS WEEKEND,

10:34.134 --> 10:36.837
AND DALIA'S AT BRAID CAMP,
SO I GUESS I COULD.

10:36.870 --> 10:40.674
BUT I'M NOT GONNA CHECK IN
AS SOME BUSYBODY NEIGHBOR.

10:40.708 --> 10:44.712
I'LL JUST SEE IF SHE WANTS
TO HANG... AS A FRIEND.

10:44.745 --> 10:46.146
THANK YOU.

10:46.179 --> 10:47.948
WHAT IS IT?

10:47.981 --> 10:50.751
I THOUGHT FOR SURE
THAT WAS FRED.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.085
I SENSED FRED ON THAT CALL.

10:52.119 --> 10:53.987
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

10:54.021 --> 10:55.122
WE HAVE
A PSYCHIC CONNECTION.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.190
IF FRED EVEN EATS SOMETHING
THAT DOESN'T AGREE WITH HIM,

10:57.224 --> 10:58.859
I CAN SENSE IT.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.093
(gags)

11:00.127 --> 11:02.763
I THINK HE JUST ATE SOMETHING
THAT DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM. UGH.

11:02.796 --> 11:06.734
OOCHIES. THIS JUST IN--
THOUSAND ISLAND BITES BACK.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.069
(chuckles)

11:09.102 --> 11:12.372
HEY, IS THAT STEVEN ROYCE?
WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.107
(George) I THOUGHT
HE WAS IN SINGAPORE.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.709
DO ME A FAVOR.
DON'T CALL HIM OVER HERE.

11:15.743 --> 11:18.946
STEVE-O!

11:18.979 --> 11:21.314
FINALLY, SOME TIME ALONE
WITH SCOTT.

11:21.348 --> 11:23.851
NOW IF I COULD JUST GET HIM
TO FOCUS ON ME INSTEAD OF...

11:23.884 --> 11:25.485
AND THAT'S BASICALLY
HOW YOU MAKE

11:25.518 --> 11:27.220
A TRADITIONAL
ZAMBIAN EATING MAT,

11:27.254 --> 11:29.389
OR MPHASA.

11:29.422 --> 11:32.192
BUT BIGGER AND LESS PLASTIC.

11:32.225 --> 11:35.195
SCOTT, I'M SURE YOU GET THIS
A LOT, BUT YOU'RE FASCINATING.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.997
I WOULD LOVE TO TRAVEL
LIKE YOU DID.

11:37.030 --> 11:41.869
WELL, IT'LL CHANGE YOU,
FROM THE INSIDE OUT.

11:41.902 --> 11:45.238
BUT BE PREPARED. AFRICA'S ALSO
FILLED WITH POVERTY AND DISEASE.

11:45.272 --> 11:48.776
YOU HAVE...
REALLY BROWN EYES.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.210
THANKS.

11:50.243 --> 11:53.513
I MET A MAN IN AFRICA
WHO DIDN'T EVEN HAVE EYES.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.015
(sighs) SCOTT...

11:55.048 --> 11:56.784
I KNOW
YOU'RE REALLY POLITICAL

11:56.817 --> 11:59.186
AND YOU HAVE ALL
THIS GLOBAL AWARENESS.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.555
I THINK THAT'S GREAT, BUT...

12:02.589 --> 12:07.060
DON'T YOU WANNA...
GET TRIBAL ON ME?

12:07.094 --> 12:08.361
THAT'S OFFENSIVE.

12:10.263 --> 12:12.099
I THINK.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.434
(doorbell rings)

12:14.467 --> 12:16.770
HEY. (chuckles)
GEORGE, WHAT ARE YOU, UH,

12:16.804 --> 12:18.305
WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THE A.C.?

12:18.338 --> 12:21.008
YEAH, STEVEN, WHAT A SURPRISE.
I HEARD YOU WERE IN SINGAPORE.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.976
WHO SAID THAT?
DALLAS.

12:23.010 --> 12:24.978
WELL, YOU SURE LIKE TALKING
TO MY WIFE A LOT.

12:25.012 --> 12:27.547
AND WHO COULD BLAME YOU?
SHE'S A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

12:27.580 --> 12:30.050
YEAH, SO IS SHE.
HUH?

12:30.083 --> 12:31.852
I DON'T LIKE TO EAT ALONE,
YOU KNOW?

12:31.885 --> 12:34.021
IT, UH, MAKES ME DEPRESSED,
AND IT LOWERS MY METABOLISM.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.556
AND BY ANY CHANCE
YOU DO TALK TO MY WIFE AGAIN,

12:36.589 --> 12:38.458
I WAS IN SINGAPORE.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.028
I HAVE VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS
IN SINGAPORE.

12:41.061 --> 12:42.162
THEY WANT ME TO MOVE THERE.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.331
REALLY? WOW.
THAT SOUNDS GREAT.

12:44.364 --> 12:45.899
YOU THINK? EVEN THOUGH
I'D HAVE TO LEAVE

12:45.933 --> 12:47.835
DALLAS AND DALIA BEHIND
FOR A BETTER PART OF A YEAR?

12:47.868 --> 12:49.469
WELL, THAT'S WHAT SKYPE'S FOR,
RIGHT?

12:49.502 --> 12:52.072
THAT IS WHAT SKYPE IS FOR.
YOU KNOW WHAT, GEORGE?

12:52.105 --> 12:53.573
DAMN IT.
YOU'RE A SMART GUY.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.876
I THINK I MIGHT HAVE
UNDERESTIMATED YOU.
YEAH, WELL...

12:55.909 --> 12:58.812
AND PLUS YOU'LL BE THERE IN CASE
ANYTHING GOES WRONG, RIGHT? HUH?

12:58.846 --> 13:00.914
IT'S CHATSWIN.
NOTHING GOES WRONG IN CHATSWIN.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.183
ISN'T THAT THE WHOLE REASON
PEOPLE LIVE THERE?

13:03.216 --> 13:05.385
(bell ringing)

13:05.418 --> 13:08.055
HOLY CRAP.
YOU'LL HAVE TO EXCUSE ME.
WHAT'S WRONG?

13:08.088 --> 13:09.890
I JUST REALIZED MY DAUGHTER
WAS A BIT TOO ANXIOUS

13:09.923 --> 13:12.492
TO GET RID OF ME THIS MORNING.

13:12.525 --> 13:13.493
WHERE'S--WHERE'S FRED?

13:13.526 --> 13:15.328
FRED? OH, HE CRAWLED OUT,
LIKE, TEN MINUTES AGO.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.830
UGH!

13:20.233 --> 13:22.269
DALLAS, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

13:22.302 --> 13:25.172
WELL, I'M ON THE DOLO TONIGHT,
AND SINCE YOU ARE, TOO,

13:25.205 --> 13:28.876
I THOUGHT WE COULD CHILLAX
OR... GET JIGGY. YOUR CHOICE.

13:28.909 --> 13:30.978
OH.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.412
OH, I SEE WHAT THIS IS.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.247
GEORGE SENT YOU HERE
TO SPY ON ME.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.983
(laughs) WHAT?

13:36.016 --> 13:38.385
I DON'T KNOW.
I AM ON THE DOLO.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.220
YOU CAN'T HIDE BEHIND
URBAN STREET SLANG, DALLAS.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.289
I SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOU.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.291
AND THIS IS
AN INVASION OF MY PRIVACY.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.226
YOU CAN TELL THAT
TO GEORGE.

13:46.259 --> 13:47.560
(whispers) HE'S A FOX.

13:47.594 --> 13:49.062
DON'T TELL THAT TO GEORGE.

13:49.096 --> 13:51.364
SO EVERYTHING
SEEMED QUIET THERE?
REAL COZY.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.867
C-COZY? WHAT--
WHAT--WHAT'S THAT MEAN--COZY?

13:53.901 --> 13:56.003
WELL, COMFY-COZY.
NO ONE WAS DRUNK,

13:56.036 --> 13:58.939
NOT TOO KRUNK. THE JOINT
WAS ON POINT, PRETTY MUCH.

13:58.972 --> 14:00.073
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

14:00.107 --> 14:01.441
STOP CONFUSING ME
WITH STREET SLANG.

14:01.474 --> 14:03.977
OH, GEORGE, YOU HAVE
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

14:04.011 --> 14:05.212
TESSA'S A GREAT GIRL,

14:05.245 --> 14:07.647
AND THAT BOY SHE HAD OVER
WAS SUPER NICE.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.082
FULLY CLOTHED.

14:09.116 --> 14:11.584
SHE--SHE HAD A-A BOY... OVER?

14:11.618 --> 14:13.453
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
IF HE WAS A BOY.

14:13.486 --> 14:15.555
HE HAD A KIND OF
A YOUNG, WHITE WESLEY SNIPES

14:15.588 --> 14:17.090
KIND OF THING GOIN'.

14:17.124 --> 14:21.261
(line disconnects, dial tone)
GEORGE?

14:21.294 --> 14:23.396
SO SHE'S GOT A GUY OVER.

14:23.430 --> 14:25.132
WHAT IS THE MATTER?
WE'RE GUYS.

14:25.165 --> 14:26.699
I WANT TO TRUST HER,
BUT I DON'T.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.535
GEORGE, AS THE FATHER
OF TWINS,

14:28.568 --> 14:31.071
I CAN TELL YOU, THEY'RE GOING TO
DO EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANNA DO.

14:31.104 --> 14:34.341
TIMES LIKE THESE,
I'M THANKFUL MY WIFE'S BARREN.

14:34.374 --> 14:36.076
(panting)

14:36.109 --> 14:38.245
(Noah) FRED!
WHERE THE HELL HAVE YOU BEEN?
I DID A BAD THING.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.379
(George)
WHERE ARE YOUR PANTS?

14:39.412 --> 14:41.915
I BET THEM!
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

14:41.949 --> 14:44.017
YOU'RE GONNA BURST IN
ON YOUR 16-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

14:44.051 --> 14:46.019
AND TELL HER THAT YOU
DON'T TRUST HER TO BE ALONE

14:46.053 --> 14:49.489
FOR 24 HOURS?
DON'T BE THAT GUY.
I'M SORRY, NOAH.

14:49.522 --> 14:51.658
I'M NOT PROUD OF IT,
BUT I AM THAT GUY.

14:51.691 --> 14:55.228
SHH! I BET EVERYTHING ON A DOG
NAMED "LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY."

14:55.262 --> 14:58.165
I MEAN, I FIGURED A NAME LIKE
THAT'S GOTTA BE IRONIC, RIGHT?

14:58.198 --> 14:59.399
(man on TV) HE GETS
RIGHT ACROSS THE RAIL...
(knock on door)

14:59.432 --> 15:00.400
WHO'S THAT?

15:00.433 --> 15:02.735
TOM-TOM CALLED SOME FREAKS.

15:02.769 --> 15:03.971
WHO'S READY TO PARTY?

15:04.004 --> 15:07.640
I AM! WHOO-HOO!
REALLY?

15:07.674 --> 15:10.510
YEAH! (laughs)

15:10.543 --> 15:12.745
I HAVE SOMETHING
THAT I WANT YOU TO DOCK

15:12.779 --> 15:14.547
IN MY DOCKING STATION.

15:14.581 --> 15:17.117
YEAH. I'LL DOCK IT,
ALL RIGHT.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.252
I'LL DOCK IT ALL NIGHT.

15:19.286 --> 15:21.021
JUST STICK IT IN GENTLY

15:21.054 --> 15:23.656
'CAUSE THE BOTTOM'S
A LITTLE CRACKED.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.624
OOH.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.493
COME ON! OKAY, OKAY, COME ON.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.961
**

15:27.995 --> 15:30.297
COME ON, "LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY"!

15:30.330 --> 15:32.432
NOT LITERALLY.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.234
COME ON!

15:34.267 --> 15:36.669
OHH, NO, NO! (cries)

15:36.703 --> 15:38.738
...VIRTUALLY FROM START
TO FINISH AT...

15:38.771 --> 15:41.174
ALL RIGHT, FRED. HOW MUCH?

15:41.208 --> 15:44.577
UH... 14. $14,000.

15:44.611 --> 15:47.347
YOU LOST $14,000?

15:47.380 --> 15:52.319
NO, I WON $14,000,
AND SHEILA IS GONNA SENSE IT.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.154
WINDFALL!

15:54.187 --> 15:55.755
WHAT?

15:55.788 --> 15:57.490
SCOTT.

15:57.524 --> 16:02.195
RIGHT NOW THIS IS THE ONLY PLACE
IN ALL OF CHATSWIN

16:02.229 --> 16:03.997
WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY
BE ALONE.

16:04.031 --> 16:07.000
LOOK, TESSA, I LIKE YOU.
I DO.

16:07.034 --> 16:09.602
AND PRE-AFRICA, I WOULD HAVE
EXPRESSED THAT TO YOU

16:09.636 --> 16:11.738
IN A VERY PHYSICAL WAY,

16:11.771 --> 16:16.109
BUT POST-AFRICA,
I NEED TO TAKE THINGS SLOW.

16:16.143 --> 16:18.378
WHY?

16:18.411 --> 16:20.313
(sighs) I SAW THINGS, TESSA--

16:20.347 --> 16:22.749
THINGS I WASN'T READY TO SEE.

16:22.782 --> 16:25.618
(whispers) VAGINAL BIRTH.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.420
AND THERE THEY WERE--

16:27.454 --> 16:30.657
THE TWO WORDS THAT CAN PUT
AN END TO ANY ROMANTIC EVENING.

16:34.161 --> 16:35.628
(kisses)

16:35.662 --> 16:38.365
SO MUCH FOR ALONE TIME
WITH SCOTT.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.567
TONIGHT WAS NOW ABOUT...
(exhales deeply)

16:40.600 --> 16:42.069
BEING ALONE.

16:45.872 --> 16:47.107
COME ON, MAN!

16:47.140 --> 16:48.308
LET'S GO, BUDDY.
OPEN THE DOOR.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.378
GO AWAY! LEAVE ME ALONE!

16:51.411 --> 16:53.546
SHEILA IS GOING TO KILL ME!

16:53.580 --> 16:54.847
IT'S GONNA BE WORSE
THAN THE TIME

16:54.881 --> 16:57.384
SHE CAUGHT ME WATCHING
"WILD THINGS" ON CABLE.

16:57.417 --> 17:00.720
(Noah) OKAY, MAYBE SHE'S GONNA
BE HAPPY WITH THE EXTRA CASH

17:00.753 --> 17:02.389
AND WILL FORGIVE YOU.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.491
HAVE YOU MET MY WIFE?!

17:04.524 --> 17:08.161
SHE IS THE LEAST FORGIVING WOMAN
IN THE WORLD,

17:08.195 --> 17:11.164
AND I WILL NEVER FIND ANYONE
AS WONDERFUL.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.765
HEY, SHE NEVER EVEN
HAS TO KNOW.

17:12.799 --> 17:15.835
YOU CAN DONATE ALL THE MONEY
TO CHARITY.

17:15.868 --> 17:19.339
(panting) I'M ENDING IT!

17:19.372 --> 17:21.074
I'M ENDING IT ALL!

17:23.610 --> 17:25.112
UHH!

17:25.145 --> 17:27.547
I'M CALLING THE HOTEL MANAGER.
YEAH.

17:27.580 --> 17:28.548
(grunts)

17:28.581 --> 17:30.417
I GOT THIS. RELAX.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.852
(chuckles) HEY. FRED, BUDDY.
STEVEN ROYCE.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.754
IS THERE ANY MIRRORS
IN THERE?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.456
YEAH, THERE'S ONE OVER THE SINK,

17:36.489 --> 17:38.591
AND THERE'S ANOTHER ONE
ON THE BACK OF THE DOOR.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.093
OKAY. DO ME A FAVOR.

17:40.127 --> 17:41.594
TAKE A GOOD, HARD LOOK
AT YOURSELF

17:41.628 --> 17:44.697
IN ONE OF THOSE MIRRORS,
OKAY?
OH, THERE'S ALSO A SMALL ONE
IN THE SHOWER--

17:44.731 --> 17:46.433
ONE OF THOSE
NON-FOGGING SHAVE ONES.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.301
JUST ANY MIRROR. DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT KIND OF MIRROR.

17:48.335 --> 17:49.436
JUST PICK A MIRROR, OKAY?

17:49.469 --> 17:51.171
OKAY.

17:51.204 --> 17:53.473
(grunts)

17:53.506 --> 17:55.142
(sighs)

17:55.175 --> 17:56.709
OKAY. I'M LOOKING.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.546
YOU'RE IN A SPIRAL, FRED.
YOU'RE IN A DOWNWARD SPIRAL.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.481
OKAY? THIS IS
AN UGLY SIDE OF YOU,

18:01.514 --> 18:03.916
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE UGLY. YOU DON'T.

18:03.950 --> 18:07.254
YOU COULD TAKE STOCK.
MAKE YOURSELF BETTER.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.388
(exhales deeply)
YEAH.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.357
OKAY? THIS IS
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU

18:10.390 --> 18:11.658
TO MAKE YOURSELF BETTER,

18:11.691 --> 18:13.260
TO CHANGE AND BECOME
BETTER THAN WHAT YOU WERE.

18:13.293 --> 18:16.896
NOT YOU TWO. YOU GUYS STAY
EXACTLY THE SAME, OKAY?

18:16.929 --> 18:18.365
I'M GONNA GO SEE MY MOTHER.

18:18.398 --> 18:21.901
I'M GONNA GO CONFRONT
MY STEPFATHER.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.270
NO.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.274
(door opens)

18:27.307 --> 18:28.408
SO SORRY, MAN.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.311
I KNOW--I KNOW THIS WASN'T
EXACTLY WHAT YOU HAD IN MIND.

18:31.344 --> 18:35.748
ARE YOU KIDDING ME, ESE?
FRED ACTUALLY DID THE LOCO.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.885
AND I DOCKED SOMETHING IN
A STRIPPER'S DOCKING STATION.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.354
YEAH.
A-A BROKEN MP3 PLAYER.

18:41.388 --> 18:43.590
STILL.
IT'S PRETTY AWESOME.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.557
(chuckles)

18:44.591 --> 18:46.593
IN FACT, I'M BEAT.
I'M GONNA GO GET SOME REST.

18:46.626 --> 18:49.296
ALL RIGHT, MAN. I'M GONNA...
WAIT A FEW MORE HOURS

18:49.329 --> 18:51.464
TILL THE SUN COMES UP
BEFORE I HIT THE ROAD,

18:51.498 --> 18:53.666
EVEN IF IT KILLS ME.

18:53.700 --> 18:55.702
I DON'T WANT TESSA TO THINK
I DON'T TRUST HER.

18:55.735 --> 18:58.471
SHE'S A GOOD KID.
YOU CAN TRUST HER.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.641
I TRUST HER.
OF COURSE, I'M LESS INVESTED.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.576
(chuckles)

19:03.610 --> 19:04.244
GOOD NIGHT.

19:04.277 --> 19:05.612
GOOD NIGHT.

19:10.917 --> 19:11.851
(door closes)

19:11.884 --> 19:13.420
DAD!

19:13.453 --> 19:15.722
"DAD," HUH? NO "GEORGE"?

19:15.755 --> 19:16.756
ARE YOU ALONE?

19:16.789 --> 19:18.625
YES, OF COURSE I'M ALONE.
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.693
I EVEN SLEPT ON THE COUCH.
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.932
I SHOULD GO AWAY MORE OFTEN.

19:25.965 --> 19:28.468
(chuckles) THAT WAS A TEST.
YOU PASSED.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.271
YOU PASSED, SENDING YOUR
LITTLE SPY OVER HERE.

19:31.304 --> 19:33.340
YEAH,
I KNEW YOU HAD A BOY HERE.

19:33.373 --> 19:35.475
AND YOU STILL DIDN'T
COME HOME.

19:36.809 --> 19:38.245
YOU TRUSTED ME.

19:38.278 --> 19:41.248
OF COURSE I TRUSTED YOU.
CAN I TRUST YOU?

19:41.281 --> 19:43.783
YES. WHAT?
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.385
I'M PRACTICALLY AN ADULT.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.919
AN ADULT. REALLY?

19:46.953 --> 19:48.355
SO I GUESS YOU DON'T WANT
THE SALT WATER TAFFY

19:48.388 --> 19:49.422
I BROUGHT HOME FOR YOU,
THEN.

19:49.456 --> 19:51.958
DON'T BE STUPID, GEORGE.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.826
GIVE ME THE TAFFY.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.929
GIVE ME THE BLUE ONE.

19:56.963 --> 19:58.298
I LIKE PINK ANYWAY.
(wrappers rustle)

20:02.302 --> 20:04.237
(door closes quietly)

20:07.340 --> 20:07.974
FRED.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.642
OHH! (exhales deeply)

20:09.676 --> 20:13.546
GOOD LORD, SHEILA.
YOU, UH, YOU STARTLED ME.

20:13.580 --> 20:14.881
IT'S NATURAL TO BE
A LITTLE ON EDGE

20:14.914 --> 20:17.016
AFTER WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

20:17.049 --> 20:18.785
I, UH,
I KNOW YOU ALREADY KNOW,

20:18.818 --> 20:20.753
BUT I-I PLANNED ON
TELLING YOU EVERYTHING.

20:20.787 --> 20:23.790
YOU DON'T HAVE TO RELIVE IT,
FRED.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.258
IT MUST HAVE BEEN
PAINFUL ENOUGH

20:25.292 --> 20:28.528
JUST HAVING BEEN THERE
WHEN ELAINE... PASSED.

20:28.561 --> 20:31.298
WH-WHEN SHE WHAT NOW?

20:31.331 --> 20:33.400
WHEN YOUR AUNT ELAINE DIED.

20:33.433 --> 20:34.501
I TRIED CALLING HER,
BUT THE PHONE

20:34.534 --> 20:36.469
JUST RANG AND RANG AND...

20:36.503 --> 20:38.037
(voice breaks)
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.473
I KNEW YOU KNEW.

20:40.507 --> 20:43.776
AND SO YOU MUST ALSO KNOW
ABOUT THE MONEY.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.345
IS THAT THE WINDFALL?

20:45.378 --> 20:47.079
THE INHERITANCE, YES.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.682
SHE LEFT US $14,000.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.384
MINUS A FEW INCIDENTALS.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.885
(gasps)

20:52.919 --> 20:54.754
I'M BUYING A NEW HOSE.
(laughs)

20:54.787 --> 20:56.756
OH.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.925
OH.

20:58.958 --> 21:00.960
(Tessa) I'M MAKING GRILLED
EGG AND CHEESE! WANT ONE?

21:00.993 --> 21:02.695
YES, I WANT ONE!

21:02.729 --> 21:06.433
**

21:10.703 --> 21:11.771
(music stops)

21:26.085 --> 21:27.320
(under breath)
YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.
