00:16.567 --> 00:18.501
* Love and marriage *

00:18.501 --> 00:21.801
* Love and marriage *

00:21.801 --> 00:25.167
* Go together like
A horse and carriage *

00:25.167 --> 00:29.334
* This I tell ya, brother *

00:29.334 --> 00:31.234
* You can't have one *

00:31.234 --> 00:33.767
* Without the other *

00:33.767 --> 00:35.868
* Love and marriage *

00:35.868 --> 00:39.167
* Love and marriage *

00:39.167 --> 00:43.200
* It's an institute
You can't disparage *

00:43.200 --> 00:46.934
* Ask the local gentry *

00:46.934 --> 00:51.667
* And they say it's elementary *

00:51.667 --> 00:56.701
* Try, try, try
To separate them *

00:56.701 --> 00:59.968
* It's an illusion *

00:59.968 --> 01:02.667
* Try, try, try *

01:02.667 --> 01:08.467
* And you will only come
To this conclusion *

01:08.467 --> 01:10.868
* Love and marriage **

01:16.100 --> 01:19.000
Now, Mom, just because
the kids don't write

01:19.000 --> 01:21.467
doesn't mean
they don't love you.

01:21.467 --> 01:25.634
Oh. They told you
they didn't love you?

01:25.634 --> 01:27.367
Well, they
didn't mean it.

01:27.367 --> 01:29.167
You know our kids.

01:29.167 --> 01:31.501
I'm sure
if you sent them some money,

01:31.501 --> 01:34.067
they'd love you.

01:34.067 --> 01:37.167
No, I couldn't watch
 <i>You Be The Judge</i> today.

01:37.167 --> 01:38.534
They put
this new streetlight up

01:38.534 --> 01:40.033
in front of the house,

01:40.033 --> 01:44.300
and I was watching the men
work with their shirts off.

01:44.300 --> 01:47.801
Oh, of course
I took pictures.

01:47.801 --> 01:50.067
Yeah, the new crime light
is real nice.

01:50.067 --> 01:52.200
Everyone in the neighborhood
is real happy about it.

01:54.067 --> 01:57.367
I hate those
new crime lights.

01:57.367 --> 01:59.367
They make everything
look yellow.

01:59.367 --> 02:00.934
This neighborhood's 
ugly enough during the day

02:00.934 --> 02:03.367
without having
to look at it at night.

02:05.067 --> 02:07.734
I can't comment on that
right now, Mom.

02:07.734 --> 02:10.199
Al just alked-way
in the or-day.

02:12.701 --> 02:14.367
Pig Latin, Peg.

02:14.367 --> 02:17.901
Must be your mother.

02:17.901 --> 02:19.067
Tell her I said "oink."

02:21.200 --> 02:23.567
What are all these envelopes
on the table, Peg?

02:23.567 --> 02:24.868
Is this supper?

02:28.167 --> 02:29.701
It's a bill
for that crime light.

02:29.701 --> 02:31.734
A $50 assessment.

02:31.734 --> 02:34.234
Peg, they're
charging me 50 bucks.

02:34.234 --> 02:38.167
Gee, I wish I had someone
to pay my bills so I could go...

02:38.167 --> 02:41.100
"Oh, gee, look, dear,
the new telephone bill came.

02:41.100 --> 02:42.667
"Let's see...

02:42.667 --> 02:45.701
Well, there's some
big, fat bills from Milwaukee."

02:45.701 --> 02:49.901
Know anybody big and fat
from Milwaukee, Peg?

02:53.234 --> 02:54.534
Hold on, Mom.

02:54.534 --> 02:57.033
That's right, your mother.

02:57.033 --> 02:58.601
Did she call collect again?

02:58.601 --> 03:00.634
No, Al, I called her.

03:00.634 --> 03:02.400
Smart shopping.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.033
Tell her I want to talk to her.

03:04.033 --> 03:06.634
Mom, Al has something
he wants to say to you.

03:10.667 --> 03:12.667
You're making
too many calls, Peg.

03:12.667 --> 03:14.167
Now, look at this bill.

03:14.167 --> 03:16.667
Milwaukee, Milwaukee,
Milwaukee...

03:16.667 --> 03:20.667
I'll bet this whole
thing comes to...

03:20.667 --> 03:22.834
$253!

03:22.834 --> 03:24.501
Family meeting!

03:28.534 --> 03:30.501
The whole family!

03:30.501 --> 03:33.300
KELLY:
I'm on the phone, Dad!

03:33.300 --> 03:36.968
I said, family meeting.

03:43.167 --> 03:44.701
Family...

03:46.167 --> 03:47.334
Coven...

03:47.334 --> 03:50.868
I thought we agreed
to cut down our calls.

03:50.868 --> 03:52.601
I only made
necessary calls.

03:52.601 --> 03:53.601
Me too.

03:53.601 --> 03:55.033
Me too.

03:55.033 --> 03:57.734
Who made these toll calls
at two bucks a pop?

03:57.734 --> 03:58.934
10 times in a row here.

03:58.934 --> 04:01.467
Who called 555-STUD?

04:08.200 --> 04:11.567
Oh, Mom!

04:11.567 --> 04:13.234
Who called DIAL-A-PRAYER?

04:13.234 --> 04:14.968
I did, Dad.

04:14.968 --> 04:17.868
But don't pay.
Kelly's still here.

04:20.466 --> 04:23.667
Let's see what else
we have here.

04:23.667 --> 04:27.634
Uh... sports hotline,
sports hotline,
sports hotline.

04:27.634 --> 04:30.334
Those are okay.

04:30.334 --> 04:31.834
Wait a second. Wait.

04:31.834 --> 04:34.767
Vancouver? $80?

04:34.767 --> 04:36.334
Kelly!

04:36.334 --> 04:38.901
Sure, all eyes
turn to me.

04:38.901 --> 04:40.901
Let me ask you this.

04:40.901 --> 04:43.300
If I did know
somebody in Vancouver,

04:43.300 --> 04:45.567
don't you think I'd be
living with them
and not here?

04:45.567 --> 04:47.567
True enough. Bud?

04:47.567 --> 04:49.067
America first, Dad.

04:49.067 --> 04:50.734
How about it, Peg?

04:50.734 --> 04:53.033
Your mother
gotten so fat,

04:53.033 --> 04:56.434
she's spread
across the border?

04:56.434 --> 04:59.167
Al, I did not call Vancouver,

04:59.167 --> 05:03.167
and Mom is down
to nearly 200.

05:03.167 --> 05:05.033
So nobody called
Vancouver?

05:05.033 --> 05:06.534
Okay, it's a mistake.

05:06.534 --> 05:08.567
I'm not paying
for mistakes.

05:08.567 --> 05:11.434
I've been doing that
since the day I got married.

05:11.434 --> 05:13.434
All right,
I'll call the phone company.

05:13.434 --> 05:14.734
What's the phone company number?

05:14.734 --> 05:16.100
Dial information.

05:16.100 --> 05:17.534
See, that's just
what I'm talking about.

05:17.534 --> 05:19.367
This is a perfect example
of how to save.

05:19.367 --> 05:22.234
We want a phone number,
we use the phone book.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.567
I was going
to burn that for heat, Al.

05:25.767 --> 05:27.968
Oh, I'd like
to burn something...

05:29.400 --> 05:32.100
"We find no error."

05:32.100 --> 05:33.501
I'm on hold for 45 minutes,

05:33.501 --> 05:35.634
listening to muzak version
of "Muskrat Love,"

05:35.634 --> 05:39.133
and they can find no error.

05:39.133 --> 05:41.067
Now that the kids are gone,

05:41.067 --> 05:42.567
I ask you one more time,

05:42.567 --> 05:45.133
did you make that call
to Vancouver?

05:45.133 --> 05:47.534
Al, that call was made
at 9:00 in the morning.

05:47.534 --> 05:48.601
Now, you know very well

05:48.601 --> 05:51.033
that that is when
I go back to sleep

05:51.033 --> 05:52.601
after you've gone to work.

05:54.868 --> 05:56.367
I'm sorry.

05:56.367 --> 05:58.000
I can't believe
they're going to

05:58.000 --> 05:59.901
make me
pay for this, Peg.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.534
Why don't you become
a game show host?

06:02.534 --> 06:04.434
Contestant comes out
and says, "I win $10,000,"

06:04.434 --> 06:06.434
you shrug,
I come out and pay him,

06:06.434 --> 06:07.300
the game's over.

06:09.033 --> 06:11.968
We'll call the show
"That Idiot Al."

06:11.968 --> 06:13.367
Honey, I'm sure
it'll work out

06:13.367 --> 06:15.234
one way or another.
Now, just go to sleep.

06:15.234 --> 06:16.767
Oh, I'm sure
it will work out.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.667
I pay for a light
I didn't want,

06:19.667 --> 06:21.667
I pay for a phone call
I didn't make,

06:21.667 --> 06:24.701
for a house,
a dog, kids, cat...

06:24.701 --> 06:26.000
Al, you know,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.200
there's still some things
we could do for free.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.501
You know, like,
dust off Mr. Van Winkle

06:30.501 --> 06:32.868
and bring him over
for a visit.

06:38.801 --> 06:41.300
Sex, Al.

06:41.300 --> 06:46.434
Great. The one thing
I would pay for.

06:46.434 --> 06:48.868
Me too.
Good night, Al.

07:06.767 --> 07:09.033
Honey,
would you be still?

07:09.033 --> 07:11.067
I'm trying
desperately

07:11.067 --> 07:14.334
to pretend
you're someone else.

07:22.801 --> 07:26.567
Settle down, Al,
and go to sleep.

07:26.567 --> 07:29.868
Yech!

07:29.868 --> 07:33.100
Where the hell is
that light coming from?

07:33.100 --> 07:35.634
It's the new
crime light, Al,

07:35.634 --> 07:37.100
shining on an
appropriate place--

07:37.100 --> 07:38.667
your feet.

07:38.667 --> 07:42.801
This just gets
better and better.

07:42.801 --> 07:48.033
$50 to have a light
shine in my face!

07:48.033 --> 07:49.167
This is great.

07:49.167 --> 07:50.901
I'm a victim,
that's what I am.

07:50.901 --> 07:54.434
City charges me $50
to shine a light in my face,

07:54.434 --> 07:55.934
nothing I can do about it.

07:55.934 --> 07:58.667
Phone company charges me $80
for a phone call I never made,

07:58.667 --> 08:00.167
nothing I can do about it.

08:00.167 --> 08:01.467
Well, from now on,

08:01.467 --> 08:04.133
Al Bundy is going to do
something about it.

08:04.133 --> 08:05.934
Tomorrow, I'm going to get
that Vancouver phone call

08:05.934 --> 08:07.634
taken off my bill

08:07.634 --> 08:08.834
and I'm going to go down

08:08.834 --> 08:10.501
and have the city move
that stupid light.

08:10.501 --> 08:12.033
From now on,

08:12.033 --> 08:14.567
Al Bundy is going to live
with a little bit of dignity.

08:20.434 --> 08:22.334
Ok, Marilyn. You ready?

08:26.033 --> 08:29.534
There, that should take care
of Bud if he's listening.

08:29.534 --> 08:32.133
Now, who's pregnant?

08:33.734 --> 08:34.967
Hi, Mom.

08:34.967 --> 08:36.133
Hi, honey.

08:36.133 --> 08:37.833
What?

08:40.467 --> 08:42.200
What you been doing?

08:42.200 --> 08:44.534
What?

08:44.534 --> 08:48.834
Bud, you've been listening in
on Kelly's call, haven't you?

08:48.834 --> 08:51.701
Remember what I told
you about that?

08:51.701 --> 08:55.868
Yeah, you said, "Be careful,
she's got a whistle now."

08:57.934 --> 09:00.534
That's better.

09:00.534 --> 09:01.868
Where's Dad?

09:01.868 --> 09:02.934
He went down

09:02.934 --> 09:04.400
to the phone company
this morning.

09:04.400 --> 09:05.400
Uh-oh.

09:05.400 --> 09:06.534
Don't worry about it.

09:06.534 --> 09:08.133
Your father does
a lot of dumb things,

09:08.133 --> 09:09.334
but even he knows

09:09.334 --> 09:11.367
you can't fight
the phone company.

09:11.367 --> 09:12.767
Hello?

09:15.701 --> 09:17.267
Hello?

09:19.467 --> 09:21.901
Mom, the phone
just went dead.

09:21.901 --> 09:26.267
Well, you're
looking at a hero.

09:30.267 --> 09:32.067
The phone company

09:32.067 --> 09:35.167
doesn't care
about just one man,

09:35.167 --> 09:38.534
but if all of us
stand together,

09:38.534 --> 09:41.033
we can bring
these bureaucratic morons

09:41.033 --> 09:42.767
to their knees.

09:45.167 --> 09:48.400
Peg, Did you tell all
the neighbors to come?

09:48.400 --> 09:50.667
I told all our friends.

09:50.667 --> 09:52.200
And?

09:55.567 --> 09:58.367
They're here.

09:58.367 --> 10:00.367
Al, why don't you
just break down

10:00.367 --> 10:01.868
and pay the phone bill?

10:01.868 --> 10:03.667
I'm not giving in.

10:03.667 --> 10:05.734
Nobody ever died because
they didn't have a telephone.

10:08.834 --> 10:10.033
Kelly.

10:10.033 --> 10:13.434
Would you go upstairs?
You're depressing us.

10:19.534 --> 10:20.734
Al...

10:20.734 --> 10:24.267
Why don't you just pay
for that phone call?

10:24.267 --> 10:25.601
Excuse me.

10:25.601 --> 10:30.200
Did I hear the trace of
a Vancouvian accent, Steve?

10:30.200 --> 10:31.934
I didn't make the call.

10:31.934 --> 10:34.033
Why not? Were you out--

10:34.033 --> 10:36.267
or should I say,
"oot"-- at the time?

10:38.567 --> 10:40.334
Gee, Steve.

10:40.334 --> 10:43.334
This is a little like
living with Columbo.

10:43.334 --> 10:46.467
You know, a dirty, wrinkled man
who won't give up.

10:46.467 --> 10:48.367
Well, I'm never
going to give up,

10:48.367 --> 10:49.834
and by the way, Steve,

10:49.834 --> 10:52.400
what was Marcie's
maiden name?

10:52.400 --> 10:54.868
It wouldn't have been
"Canuck" by any chance?

10:57.100 --> 11:00.334
Al, aren't you punishing
your family enough

11:00.334 --> 11:02.767
by living with them?

11:02.767 --> 11:03.868
Why punish them more

11:03.868 --> 11:06.300
over one lousy
$80 phone bill?

11:06.300 --> 11:08.234
One lousy
$80 phone bill?

11:08.234 --> 11:11.234
Oh, forgive me,
O Sheik Achmed Rhoades.

11:11.234 --> 11:16.267
Peg, where's that spare 80
I use to light my cigars?

11:16.267 --> 11:17.434
Hi.

11:17.434 --> 11:20.133
Oh, hi, Marcie.
Gee, thanks.

11:20.133 --> 11:21.234
First, you say,

11:21.234 --> 11:23.067
"Oh, Steve, we'd only be
insulting the buffoon

11:23.067 --> 11:25.300
if we missed
his stupid meeting,

11:25.300 --> 11:27.200
then you don't show up.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.534
Sorry, Steve,
but I was on the phone.

11:29.534 --> 11:31.701
You see,
there's an example

11:31.701 --> 11:34.534
of America's obsession
with the telephone.

11:34.534 --> 11:37.868
I was on the telephone
taking messages for your family.

11:37.868 --> 11:40.567
Peggy, your mother called.

11:40.567 --> 11:43.167
Peggy,
your mother called.

11:43.167 --> 11:45.801
Peggy, your mother called.

11:45.801 --> 11:49.400
And, Peggy,
DIAL-A-STUD called.

11:52.434 --> 11:54.067
They wanted to know
if you were okay

11:54.067 --> 11:55.400
and to tell you Juan is back.

11:58.434 --> 12:01.033
Anything for me?

12:01.033 --> 12:02.534
No.

12:02.534 --> 12:04.367
Oh.

12:08.667 --> 12:11.467
Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad.

12:11.467 --> 12:12.934
[RING, RING]

12:12.934 --> 12:14.567
[RING, RING]

12:14.567 --> 12:18.167
Kelly, it's for you!

12:19.634 --> 12:21.634
Thank you,
thank you, thank you,

12:21.634 --> 12:22.634
thank you, thank you.

12:22.634 --> 12:24.367
Hello?

12:25.968 --> 12:27.834
Hello?

12:38.167 --> 12:41.567
Gee, I love doing that.

12:41.567 --> 12:44.834
Now, see? Bud's handling
this the best way.

12:44.834 --> 12:46.734
Good boy, Bud.

12:48.834 --> 12:51.000
Now, I know that
you're all upset at me,

12:51.000 --> 12:52.934
and you don't really understand
why I'm doing this,

12:52.934 --> 12:55.133
but I will not
roll over and die,

12:55.133 --> 12:57.133
and I will rest easy,

12:57.133 --> 13:00.968
because I sleep
the sleep of the righteous.

13:08.534 --> 13:09.634
Peg.

13:09.634 --> 13:10.868
Peg.

13:10.868 --> 13:12.367
I can't sleep.

13:12.367 --> 13:13.968
What can I do?

13:13.968 --> 13:15.234
Well...

13:15.234 --> 13:17.734
Since we're not
using the telephone,

13:17.734 --> 13:20.734
we could wrap the cord
around your neck

13:20.734 --> 13:23.734
and slowly tighten it
till the sandman comes.

13:23.734 --> 13:25.234
Ah, you women.

13:25.234 --> 13:29.400
You can't forget about
that maternal instinct, can you?

13:29.400 --> 13:31.501
Good night, Al.

13:33.634 --> 13:35.067
Peg.

13:35.067 --> 13:36.300
Remember a long time ago

13:36.300 --> 13:38.434
when you wanted
this side of the bed?

13:38.434 --> 13:41.067
You know,
close to the window?

13:41.067 --> 13:43.601
What was my reason
for not giving it to you?

13:43.601 --> 13:46.634
Well, let's see,
it was something like,

13:46.634 --> 13:50.534
"I work, I make the money,
I deserve the air."

13:50.534 --> 13:52.501
You know, it's funny, Peg.

13:52.501 --> 13:54.000
It took me 15 years to realize

13:54.000 --> 13:55.501
that you were right
all the time.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.400
See, I can't sleep
knowing you'd rather be here.

13:58.400 --> 13:59.501
Slide over, Peg.

13:59.501 --> 14:00.667
No, Al.

14:00.667 --> 14:03.667
We need your feet
by the window.

14:03.667 --> 14:07.367
They keep away
the mosquitoes.

14:07.367 --> 14:10.534
STEVE: Hey, Bundy!
Telephone!

14:12.133 --> 14:14.300
It's 2:00 in the morning.

14:14.300 --> 14:15.801
What do they want?

14:15.801 --> 14:19.334
It's Peggy's mother.

14:19.334 --> 14:20.968
Oh, it's for you.

14:20.968 --> 14:21.968
Oh.

14:26.934 --> 14:30.067
Hi, Mom!
What do you want?

14:30.067 --> 14:34.300
STEVE: Your recipe
for raisin bread.

14:34.300 --> 14:37.300
Tell her to get
a fresh loaf of bread,

14:37.300 --> 14:40.434
a box of raisins,
and a hammer.

14:42.834 --> 14:44.601
All right.

14:44.601 --> 14:47.534
I just found the answer
to all our problems.

14:48.701 --> 14:50.467
Ta-dah!

14:52.501 --> 14:55.200
We're all going to get
an allotment of dimes.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.033
Then, when you have to make
a phone call,

14:57.033 --> 14:58.400
you come to me.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.400
And if I feel
the phone call is worthy,

15:01.400 --> 15:02.901
I'll give you some dimes

15:02.901 --> 15:05.901
to go down to the phone booth
at the gas station.

15:05.901 --> 15:10.734
See, once again,
problem... solution.

15:10.734 --> 15:12.834
Dad, sit down.

15:15.234 --> 15:18.267
I worry to see
you slipping away.

15:18.267 --> 15:19.767
You know,
this phone thing--

15:19.767 --> 15:22.767
how can I say this
without hurting you?

15:22.767 --> 15:25.567
It's stupid.

15:25.567 --> 15:27.767
I want to explain
something, son.

15:27.767 --> 15:29.467
Is this going to be
long and boring?

15:29.467 --> 15:32.400
Like the "Why did we
have Kelly" speech?

15:32.400 --> 15:37.367
No, because I know
the answer to this one.

15:37.367 --> 15:38.868
You see, the trouble

15:38.868 --> 15:41.367
with America today,
son, is this...

15:41.367 --> 15:44.167
Nobody stands up
for anything anymore.

15:44.167 --> 15:46.601
So can we have a phone?

15:46.601 --> 15:47.934
No.

15:47.934 --> 15:49.167
No, but it's
pretty pathetic.

15:49.167 --> 15:52.133
See, we used to have slogans
like "Don't tread on me,"

15:52.133 --> 15:53.634
"54-40 or fight,"

15:53.634 --> 15:56.067
"Tippecanoe
and somebody too."

15:56.067 --> 15:57.501
Then, all of a sudden,

15:57.501 --> 15:59.067
people stopped
standing up for themselves.

15:59.067 --> 16:02.567
Now we have slogans
like "Have a nice day,"

16:02.567 --> 16:04.167
"Make love, not war."

16:04.167 --> 16:09.534
"Hi, I'm an American.
I'm sorry."

16:09.534 --> 16:10.901
What's that got to do

16:10.901 --> 16:12.200
with us being
the only people

16:12.200 --> 16:14.033
in the free world
without a telephone?

16:14.033 --> 16:15.734
It's got everything
to do with it.

16:15.734 --> 16:17.234
See, the point is,

16:17.234 --> 16:20.234
if they tried to
charge Thomas Jefferson

16:20.234 --> 16:22.734
with a call
he didn't make,

16:22.734 --> 16:25.767
the Boston Harbor would've
been full of phones,

16:25.767 --> 16:26.968
and all the local women

16:26.968 --> 16:28.767
would've been
swimming around down there,

16:28.767 --> 16:33.634
and we wouldn't have
had to hang them as witches.

16:33.634 --> 16:36.667
So, you're kind of like
Thomas Jefferson?

16:36.667 --> 16:39.133
That I am, Bud.

16:39.133 --> 16:41.334
Then why do they call him
a great man,

16:41.334 --> 16:42.868
and they call you "butthead."

16:48.701 --> 16:49.868
Well, if that's

16:49.868 --> 16:52.300
a new word for "patriot,"
so be it.

16:52.300 --> 16:53.934
Now, I'm going
down to the corner

16:53.934 --> 16:56.167
with a letter
to the utility company

16:56.167 --> 16:58.133
to get rid of that light.

16:58.133 --> 16:59.868
Peg, do you want anything?

16:59.868 --> 17:02.601
Yes, but bigamy's
illegal in this state.

17:04.666 --> 17:06.934
Alrighty.

17:06.934 --> 17:08.534
I'll fill that baby with dimes,

17:08.534 --> 17:09.834
and we're going to learn

17:09.834 --> 17:12.834
you don't need a phone company
to have a phone.

17:12.834 --> 17:13.834
See you later.

17:13.834 --> 17:16.834
Say goodbye to Daddy's dream.

17:19.434 --> 17:23.867
Making raisin bread, Mom?

17:23.867 --> 17:26.067
Not this time, honey.

17:26.067 --> 17:27.400
Well, bye, Mom.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.067
If you need me,
I'll be in the streets.

17:30.067 --> 17:33.667
Okay, but I don't think
I'll need you.

17:33.667 --> 17:36.501
And tell Daddy that
I am not moving back in

17:36.501 --> 17:39.968
until we get a phone
or I get married.

17:39.968 --> 17:42.400
Kelly, honey,
there is no reason

17:42.400 --> 17:44.400
for anyone to leave home.

17:44.400 --> 17:47.400
We are not going to be
without a phone for much longer.

17:47.400 --> 17:50.400
I've taken matters
into my own hands.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.567
Now, kids, we need $80.

17:52.567 --> 17:56.067
There must be something
around here we can sell.

17:56.067 --> 17:58.901
Kelly, quick.
Your liver.

17:58.901 --> 18:00.400
For a phone?

18:00.400 --> 18:02.234
I'll do it.

18:02.234 --> 18:03.634
Not yet, Kelly.

18:03.634 --> 18:05.100
Since this is
your father's fault,

18:05.100 --> 18:07.467
I think we should start
with his things.

18:07.467 --> 18:09.501
I'll get
his bowling ball.

18:09.501 --> 18:11.501
I'll get
his fishing rods.

18:11.501 --> 18:14.467
And I'll get his, uh...
well, that's all he's got.

18:17.734 --> 18:19.167
Hey, what's going on here?

18:20.567 --> 18:21.801
Dad. The women--

18:21.801 --> 18:24.534
They were going
to sell your stuff.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.534
He makes
the money, Mom.

18:30.534 --> 18:32.434

You can't beat
the phone company.

18:41.534 --> 18:43.801
So much for Bundy unity.

18:43.801 --> 18:44.934
I'll tell you something.

18:44.934 --> 18:46.000
This is the first time

18:46.000 --> 18:47.634
I've ever been ashamed
of my family.

18:47.634 --> 18:51.167
You'll get used to it, Al.
We did.

18:51.167 --> 18:53.167
Well, get used to this.

18:53.167 --> 18:55.167
We're not getting a phone

18:55.167 --> 18:58.834
until the phone company
calls and apologizes to me.

18:58.834 --> 19:01.434
Dad, is there anything
we can say

19:01.434 --> 19:02.734
to make you change
your mind,

19:02.734 --> 19:04.234
you know, like,
"We love you"?

19:04.234 --> 19:07.300
Or would you see
right through that?

19:07.300 --> 19:08.868
I would.

19:08.868 --> 19:11.868
Look, do you know what
the worst thing is

19:11.868 --> 19:16.567
for a fellow to grow up
and hear somebody call him?

19:16.567 --> 19:18.701
A shoe salesman.

19:20.067 --> 19:21.267
Worse.

19:21.267 --> 19:23.901
A quitter.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.901
See, if I quit right now,

19:25.901 --> 19:27.901
it would be like--
I don't know--

19:27.901 --> 19:30.267
quitting.

19:30.267 --> 19:31.834
So, Daddy,
if we stopped trying

19:31.834 --> 19:34.734
to make you
put the phone back in,

19:34.734 --> 19:36.601
wouldn't that
make us quitters?

we'll ever do for you too.

she's in motion,

on one condition--

21:34.901 --> 21:37.033
that you pay
that phone bill.

21:37.033 --> 21:39.300
Done. You win.
But hurry.
