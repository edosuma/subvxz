00:13.380 --> 00:15.689
Okay, Peg.
I tried to use our ATM card.

00:15.900 --> 00:17.049
I stuck it in.

00:17.260 --> 00:19.091
It spit it out.

00:20.420 --> 00:22.012
And it laughed at me.

00:23.820 --> 00:25.936
Sound familiar?

00:27.420 --> 00:29.092
How many times have I told you, Al?

00:29.300 --> 00:31.939
You got to stick it in the right way.

00:32.340 --> 00:35.855
And, you know, pressing
the right buttons wouldn't hurt either.

00:36.060 --> 00:37.937
Peg, you got to stop wasting
all our money.

00:38.140 --> 00:40.608
I'm not wasting it.
I'm investing it.

00:40.820 --> 00:43.015
Yes, Peg,
and nothing appreciates faster...

00:43.220 --> 00:46.769
...than these Little Rascals
Last Supper commemorative plates.

00:48.140 --> 00:51.530
Doesn't Alfalfa make a haunting Judas?

00:51.740 --> 00:54.049
You know, these aren't available
in any store.

00:54.260 --> 00:57.138
Whereas food,
which often appears on the plate, is.

01:00.500 --> 01:03.936
Forgive him, Buckwheat,
he knows not what he does.

01:05.459 --> 01:07.337
Peg, this home shopping
has got to stop.

01:07.540 --> 01:09.132
Okay, Al.

01:09.340 --> 01:10.659
Where are you going?

01:10.860 --> 01:13.328
I am going
to Shopaholics Anonymous.

01:13.540 --> 01:17.089
- Good.
- But first I need a new dress.

01:18.740 --> 01:20.093
Hey.

01:23.820 --> 01:27.859
Daddy, I need 100 bucks for something
really, really, really important.

01:28.060 --> 01:31.655
Pumpkin, you're not going to buy
another bridge, are you?

01:33.260 --> 01:35.933
What would I do with six bridges?

01:36.540 --> 01:38.178
No, it's for my acting career.

01:38.380 --> 01:41.372
I'm taking an improve class.

01:41.580 --> 01:45.050
You know, improvisation
where you make things up.

01:45.820 --> 01:48.288
Why don't you make up 100 bucks?

01:48.500 --> 01:50.218
Okay. Thanks.

01:50.420 --> 01:53.298
Wait a minute. How am I supposed
to make up money I don't have?

01:53.500 --> 01:55.013
Ask your mother.

01:56.580 --> 01:58.696
Great news, everybody.

02:02.980 --> 02:04.129
It's official.

02:04.340 --> 02:07.059
Oh, lllinois finally recognized...

02:07.260 --> 02:10.013
...the sacred bond
between you and your hand.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.972
Just like the sacred bond
between you...

02:13.180 --> 02:15.455
...and anyone
with a shiny new penny.

02:16.220 --> 02:19.018
Dad, I just got a big infomercial
for one of my new clients.

02:19.220 --> 02:23.418
Hey, hey, hey, now, does that mean
that you're making money?

02:23.620 --> 02:26.339
Well, not like you tried to do
at Kinko's but-

02:26.820 --> 02:30.529
That would have worked
if I'd sprung for the colour copies.

02:30.740 --> 02:32.412
Anyway, I'm earning my money.

02:32.620 --> 02:35.930
Well, son, if you're earning money,
that means you can pay some rent.

02:36.700 --> 02:38.338
Rent?

02:38.780 --> 02:41.135
Now, son, it was one thing
when were you in school...

02:41.340 --> 02:43.570
...which, by the way,
I never approved of.

02:44.660 --> 02:45.649
Why me?

02:45.860 --> 02:48.055
Why don't you charge Kelly rent?
Or Mom?

02:48.260 --> 02:51.491
Well, son,
Kelly hasn't slept here in years.

02:52.900 --> 02:57.735
If I try to charge your mother rent,
she might expect things.

02:58.540 --> 03:01.338
No way am I paying rent
for that dump.

03:01.540 --> 03:04.338
Well, then you know the drill, Bud.

03:11.420 --> 03:14.730
The best shopping carts
are at Foodtown.

03:53.220 --> 03:54.972
Hey, Daddy?

03:58.100 --> 04:01.172
I need to do some homework
for my improve class...

04:01.660 --> 04:03.616
...so give me a situation.

04:03.820 --> 04:06.539
Daddy's watching the baseball game.

04:07.180 --> 04:08.613
Got it.

04:24.340 --> 04:27.457
Now daddy's mowing the lawn.

04:28.860 --> 04:32.614
Damn lawn. Damn kid. Damn wife.

04:33.860 --> 04:36.613
Forget it, Peg, no sex tonight.

04:40.620 --> 04:43.896
Okay, honey. Just as well.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.538
Improv class?

04:46.740 --> 04:49.891
Yes, best money I ever spent,
with all due respect...

04:50.100 --> 04:53.410
<i>...to the My Three Sons
Holy Trinity serving tray.</i>

04:56.420 --> 04:58.570
Damn thing.

05:07.500 --> 05:08.853
Well, where have you been?

05:09.060 --> 05:11.449
I slept in Lucky's doghouse.

05:11.660 --> 05:14.299
You have any idea what it's like
sleeping with somebody...

05:14.500 --> 05:16.616
...who's constantly panting
and licking you...

05:16.820 --> 05:19.209
...and wagging their tail
all in your face?

05:19.420 --> 05:21.058
Welcome to my world, son.

05:23.540 --> 05:24.939
This isn't fair, Dad.

05:25.140 --> 05:27.051
You didn't charge me
when I lived upstairs.

05:27.260 --> 05:29.774
Well, that's because
that was a less desirable location.

05:29.980 --> 05:32.210
That was near your mother.

05:33.060 --> 05:35.972
All right, fine. How much rent
do you think would be fair?

05:36.180 --> 05:39.138
Son, I got that all figured out.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.376
It's based on
a very complicated formula...

05:41.580 --> 05:44.333
...that I've been working on
since day that you were born.

05:44.540 --> 05:48.533
Oh, look, it's Bud's baby book.

05:48.740 --> 05:51.095
Hey, I didn't know
you kept one of those for me.

05:51.300 --> 05:52.858
Why, sure.

05:53.060 --> 05:56.894
<i>Oh, now look at this:
Baby's first expense.</i>

05:57.100 --> 06:00.376
Yeah, one broken condom.

06:04.660 --> 06:08.619
Oh, and look, Bud,
your first pacifier.

06:08.820 --> 06:10.492
A sock?

06:12.020 --> 06:14.932
If we gave him a little more rubber
when he was teething...

06:15.140 --> 06:17.176
...he wouldn't be dating it now.

06:20.060 --> 06:23.291
Oh, look, Bud, your first words.

06:24.620 --> 06:26.975
" Bud need food. "

06:29.180 --> 06:31.535
" Bud want food. "

06:31.900 --> 06:33.379
"Ouch"?

06:34.020 --> 06:37.330
Nobody likes a whiny baby, Bud.

06:38.620 --> 06:44.377
- Why aren't there any pictures of me?
- Frankly, son, you were one ugly baby.

06:45.580 --> 06:47.536
I thought you were beautiful.

06:47.740 --> 06:51.096
Oh, come on, Peg,
you used to diaper his face.

06:52.020 --> 06:53.533
That's because he was colicky.

06:53.740 --> 06:57.176
Oh, now, son,
it's all here. Every fond moment...

06:57.380 --> 07:01.532
...and every cent that you cost me
from the time you were born.

07:02.940 --> 07:05.738
One soda. That's 65 cents.

07:06.260 --> 07:07.739
You're still writing it all down?

07:07.940 --> 07:09.498
Oh, no. We're way beyond that.

07:22.620 --> 07:24.656
This is insane.

07:24.860 --> 07:27.499
Okay. Okay. Fine.

07:27.860 --> 07:29.259
I'll pay you 200 a month...

07:29.460 --> 07:33.248
...but I want to make it legal.
Here's a check and here's a lease.

07:34.980 --> 07:36.652
That's a deal.

07:36.860 --> 07:40.375
Great. Now that I am paying you,
you can make the repairs.

07:40.580 --> 07:41.774
What repairs?

07:41.980 --> 07:43.049
Look, I know my rights.

07:43.260 --> 07:46.138
As your legal tenant, I can report you
to the Housing Authority.

07:46.340 --> 07:49.889
And as your legal father,
I can give you five across the eyes.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.933
There's absolutely nothing wrong
with that basement.

07:54.140 --> 07:57.371
This basement is condemned.

07:58.780 --> 08:01.578
On what possible basis?

08:01.940 --> 08:05.819
For one thing,
I'm standing in raw sewage.

08:06.380 --> 08:09.816
Ma'am, your control problems
are not my concern.

08:14.620 --> 08:15.814
What about these rats?

08:16.020 --> 08:18.454
Well, how did they get in here?

08:18.660 --> 08:20.696
They're trying to get out.

08:21.300 --> 08:24.656
This wiring is clearly substandard.

08:24.860 --> 08:28.011
Well, now that's impossible.
I did the work myself.

08:30.580 --> 08:34.174
Mr. Bundy, you've had a month
to get this place in shape.

08:34.380 --> 08:37.816
You had your whole life to get in shape.
You don't see me condemning you.

08:42.380 --> 08:43.813
That's it.

08:44.020 --> 08:47.410
Mr. Bundy, you are a slumlord
and by the power vested in me...

08:47.620 --> 08:50.692
...by the Department of Housing,
you're confined to this basement...

08:50.900 --> 08:52.856
- ... until you agree to make repairs.
- What?

08:53.060 --> 08:54.049
What if there's a fire?

08:54.260 --> 08:56.979
Those wires are clearly substandard.

08:57.740 --> 08:59.856
What the-
What the hell are you doing?

09:00.060 --> 09:02.699
This is an electronic
mobility limitation device.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.936
It'll prevent you from leaving
the premises.

09:05.140 --> 09:07.495
Much like your hips in a turnstile.

09:09.300 --> 09:13.213
If you come within two feet
of this device or 10 feet from it...

09:13.420 --> 09:14.773
...you will be shocked.

09:14.980 --> 09:17.050
Yeah, right. Like that scares me.

09:17.260 --> 09:20.297
Like this collar is going to keep me
in this hellhole.

09:23.260 --> 09:25.728
Come get me. Come on. Come on.

09:37.380 --> 09:39.132
It's fascinating.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.570
Despite three hours
of negative conditioning...

09:41.780 --> 09:44.533
...the subject continues to go
for the food.

09:46.420 --> 09:48.376
Son of a bitch.

09:50.140 --> 09:51.971
What an idiot.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.814
You know, I think Daddy needs
some exercise.

09:55.020 --> 09:57.614
No. We are not letting him out.

09:57.820 --> 10:00.380
Oh, no. I was thinking
about getting him one of those...

10:00.580 --> 10:02.457
...you know,
those giant hamster wheels.

10:02.660 --> 10:04.776
Just to keep him running.

10:05.020 --> 10:07.659
Where do you think
you're going to get one of those?

10:07.860 --> 10:11.011
Duh? At the giant hamster store.

10:14.820 --> 10:19.177
<i>" Note to journal
regarding long-term subject:</i>

10:19.420 --> 10:22.059
IQ still plummeting.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.453
No sign of bottom. "

10:29.580 --> 10:31.377
Dad, are you gonna make
the repairs?

10:31.580 --> 10:35.175
No, you degenerate little ingrate.

10:35.620 --> 10:37.372
Hey, now.

10:37.580 --> 10:40.458
That language might have been okay
when I was a child...

10:40.660 --> 10:44.699
...but now that I'm paying rent,
I expect to be treated like an adult.

10:44.900 --> 10:46.538
An adult?

10:46.740 --> 10:48.856
You still live at home.

10:49.420 --> 10:50.933
You still work at the mall.

10:51.140 --> 10:52.334
Yeah, well, listen.

10:52.540 --> 10:55.373
Pay up because I'm up
for assistant manager.

10:56.100 --> 10:57.613
If I can ever get out of here.

10:58.020 --> 10:59.897
You can get out
when you make the repairs.

11:00.100 --> 11:01.738
No way. It's a matter of principle.

11:01.940 --> 11:03.453
Maybe I can bribe my wait out.

11:03.660 --> 11:06.220
How about a hundred bucks?

11:06.420 --> 11:08.980
That's Kinko's money. Forget it.

11:10.860 --> 11:12.452
Okay, 200.

11:12.660 --> 11:14.616
- Three hundred.
- No way.

11:14.820 --> 11:19.257
What do you think, this stuff is free?
Every hundred dollar bill costs 8 cents.

11:20.580 --> 11:25.256
- Where's the original?
- I left the original in the copy machine.

11:30.180 --> 11:33.855
" Idiocy, obviously hereditary.

11:37.620 --> 11:39.736
In females. "

11:40.700 --> 11:45.854
Oh, Al, you promised
to take out the garbage.

11:46.060 --> 11:48.016
Gee, I'm sorry, Peg, I'd love to.

11:48.220 --> 11:52.213
But one more shock
and my liver will be medium well.

11:52.420 --> 11:56.379
But then who's going to rub
my bottom?

11:57.140 --> 11:59.574
Peg, I'm sorry, but the law is the law.

11:59.780 --> 12:03.011
I did the crime,
so I should do the time.

12:05.220 --> 12:06.619
Al.

12:06.820 --> 12:08.219
Hey.

12:09.260 --> 12:10.978
Jefferson.

12:11.340 --> 12:13.171
I'm stuck.

12:14.260 --> 12:17.013
Well, divorce her.
Just leave me out of it.

12:17.220 --> 12:19.939
I came here to rescue you...

12:20.580 --> 12:23.140
...but there's a really big spider...

12:23.340 --> 12:26.252
- ... coming right towards me.
- Hey, getting stuck down here is...

12:26.460 --> 12:28.337
...the best thing
that ever happened to me.

12:28.540 --> 12:31.691
What are you talking about, Al?
This is a prison.

12:31.900 --> 12:35.575
This isn't prison. Upstairs is a prison.
That's hard time.

12:35.780 --> 12:39.090
Warden Red is always threatening
to stick me in the hotbox.

12:39.580 --> 12:42.333
Okay. Let me get this straight.

12:42.540 --> 12:45.259
Al is stuck here.

12:51.180 --> 12:53.375
And I get to torture him.

12:54.380 --> 12:56.336
Here's another hundred.

12:57.220 --> 12:58.573
Now, you enjoy yourself.

12:58.780 --> 13:00.372
Remember, you gotta be out by 2.

13:00.580 --> 13:03.936
You'd be surprised at
how many people want to torture Dad.

13:04.500 --> 13:06.331
No, I wouldn't.

13:08.820 --> 13:10.697
So, Dad.

13:10.900 --> 13:12.492
Are you sure you're having fun?

13:12.700 --> 13:13.849
Yup.

13:14.060 --> 13:17.848
Well, in that case,
let's play Wheel of Torture.

13:18.980 --> 13:21.369
Our first contestant hails
from next door.

13:21.580 --> 13:26.654
She's a banker, an avid golfer
and quite a screamer in bed.

13:29.580 --> 13:31.855
You live next door, you hear things.

13:33.060 --> 13:36.689
Well, what's she going to do,
Bud, pick my eyes out?

13:37.020 --> 13:39.454
Sit on me till I crack?

13:41.780 --> 13:42.815
Al...

13:43.020 --> 13:47.935
...did I ever tell you
about how I became a feminist?

13:50.780 --> 13:53.453
<i>It all started when I read
The Feminine Mystique...</i>

13:53.660 --> 13:55.776
...and I threw away my Lady Schick.

13:55.980 --> 13:58.130
Well, that's two mistakes.

13:59.940 --> 14:01.692
Did you ever notice...

14:01.900 --> 14:03.697
...how the nipples
in that poster seem...

14:03.940 --> 14:05.419
...to follow you around the room?

14:09.340 --> 14:12.377
That is so degrading to women.

14:17.020 --> 14:18.738
Anyway...

14:21.380 --> 14:23.940
My true awakening occurred...

14:24.140 --> 14:28.133
...when I decided
to take charge of my own orgasms.

14:28.340 --> 14:30.979
You know, Al,
how my womanhood blossomed.

14:31.180 --> 14:34.729
Oh, God, how my stomach
is churning.

14:35.620 --> 14:37.372
You know, I couldn't have done it...

14:37.580 --> 14:39.810
...without the support
of my women's group.

14:40.020 --> 14:43.410
One day, we all sat in a circle...

14:43.620 --> 14:46.657
...naked, but non-judgemental...

14:47.460 --> 14:52.090
...and then all six of us pulled out
our hand mirrors...

14:53.700 --> 14:55.372
...and guess what happened?

14:58.980 --> 15:01.813
Forty-two years of bad luck?

15:03.340 --> 15:07.697
That day inspired an epic poem.

15:07.900 --> 15:10.573
<i>I think that I shall never see</i>

15:10.820 --> 15:14.096
<i>My G-spot smiling back at my me</i>

15:24.260 --> 15:26.296
I got to give you credit, big guy...

15:26.500 --> 15:29.219
...I can't believe
that didn't break you.

15:29.420 --> 15:32.935
You forget who I'm married to.
Torture is my middle name.

15:33.940 --> 15:36.579
Well, then,
let's meet guest number two.

15:36.780 --> 15:39.897
She's an aspiring actress,
an annoying sister...

15:40.100 --> 15:42.091
...and she's just mastered
the alphabet.

15:42.300 --> 15:45.815
Kelly Bundy, come on down.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.570
How, Daddy.

15:55.460 --> 15:59.339
Kelly will now improv
the history of the United States.

16:00.340 --> 16:01.898
Enjoy.

16:02.700 --> 16:06.090
Is that your real name, John Smith?

16:06.300 --> 16:09.929
Me thinkum this one big kiss-off.

16:13.380 --> 16:16.736
Sorry, Chief Thunder Pants.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.853
What a glorious day
for our new country.

16:21.060 --> 16:25.895
We defeated the British
and I have a new baby boy.

16:27.100 --> 16:30.490
I'm going to name him Bob Dole.

16:32.740 --> 16:34.412
General Sherman...

16:34.620 --> 16:38.374
...you have lit more
than Atlanta on fire.

16:38.580 --> 16:44.212
As God is my witness,
I will never be horny again.

16:45.740 --> 16:50.256
Houston, we have a problem.

16:50.860 --> 16:53.499
We can see Uranus.

16:55.860 --> 17:00.775
We seem to have an asteroidal flap.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.414
Hey, is this thing on?

17:10.780 --> 17:12.849
He still won't make the repairs.

17:13.060 --> 17:14.573
He is so stubborn.

17:14.780 --> 17:17.339
You should see him on bath night.

17:18.460 --> 17:21.133
Well, I did my best
with the Chinese daughter torture.

17:21.339 --> 17:25.049
All right. Somehow we gotta come up
with the perfect torture for Daddy.

17:25.260 --> 17:29.458
Now, what does he find
really repulsive and unbearable?

17:39.020 --> 17:41.295
Why are you looking at me?

17:52.060 --> 17:55.450
Boy, in a couple of years,
this stuff really builds up.

18:07.740 --> 18:10.300
You know,
it's not half bad down here.

18:10.580 --> 18:13.413
A couple of repairs,
a fellow could live down here.

18:22.220 --> 18:23.699
Who's there?

18:33.700 --> 18:35.656
Oh, Al...

18:35.860 --> 18:40.138
...it's time for your conjugal visit.

18:42.220 --> 18:44.609
Okay. Bud, help me.

18:47.780 --> 18:52.854
Shut up, Al. You're my bitch now.

18:54.740 --> 18:57.174
Oh, the horror.

18:57.940 --> 19:00.056
The horror.

19:01.580 --> 19:04.140
No, no, Peg. No, I can't.

19:04.340 --> 19:06.058
My knees are all skinned.
I'm bruised.

19:06.260 --> 19:09.411
I got a press-on nail
stuck in my butt.

19:10.380 --> 19:12.450
Relax, Dad.

19:12.660 --> 19:13.888
Oh, son, thank God.

19:14.100 --> 19:17.695
Son, get me out of this thing
before that thing comes back.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.058
You promise to make the repairs?

19:20.260 --> 19:24.173
Okay, son, you win. You win.

19:24.380 --> 19:25.495
Gee, Dad.

19:25.700 --> 19:28.897
Mom left teeth marks
all over your neck.

19:29.100 --> 19:32.456
No, son. That was me.
I tried to sever my own jugular.

19:35.900 --> 19:37.936
Damn clotting.

19:39.100 --> 19:42.137
Okay. I'll let you go,
but you got to promise...

19:42.340 --> 19:45.537
- ... to give me a head start?
- Why, sure, son. What do you think?

19:45.740 --> 19:47.935
I'm going to track you like a dog
and kill you?

19:48.140 --> 19:52.019
Sure, a normal father would do that,
but we're Bundys.

19:52.740 --> 19:56.050
Oh, God, what does that mean?
You're going to eat me?

19:57.220 --> 19:59.450
No, Bud.

19:59.660 --> 20:02.857
I want to give you a pat
on the back. See, son, I-

20:03.060 --> 20:04.937
I never thought
you took much after me.

20:05.140 --> 20:08.132
I always thought you were more
of a Wanker than a Bundy.

20:08.580 --> 20:09.569
Why?

20:09.780 --> 20:13.170
Well, you know, your laziness,
your sloping forehead...

20:13.620 --> 20:16.578
...your ability to catch flies
with your tongue.

20:17.140 --> 20:19.290
- This what you call a pat on the back?
- No, son.

20:19.500 --> 20:24.176
Now you got mad like anybody would,
but you got mad and even.

20:24.380 --> 20:25.495
See?

20:25.700 --> 20:28.692
That makes you a part
of the grand Bundy tradition.

20:28.900 --> 20:31.619
You know, I'll never forget
my old man. Sweet guy.

20:31.820 --> 20:34.459
Sold my Schwinn
for the price of a drink.

20:35.220 --> 20:39.338
I was so mad at him, before he knew it,
I enlisted him into the army.

20:40.260 --> 20:42.615
When he came back from Korea,
he was so ticked off...

20:42.820 --> 20:44.970
...it's a good thing
he was in a wheelchair.

20:47.260 --> 20:48.215
Beautiful story, Dad.

20:48.420 --> 20:51.378
The point is, I think that deep down
my dad was proud of me.

20:51.580 --> 20:52.695
Why, he said that?

20:52.900 --> 20:56.529
Not in so many words,
but he blinked twice for "Yes. "

20:57.380 --> 21:00.577
So you're saying you were proud
of me for the way I tortured you?

21:00.780 --> 21:02.850
That I am, Bud.

21:04.060 --> 21:06.016
Guess I learned from the best.

21:06.220 --> 21:07.858
Son.

21:08.700 --> 21:10.338
Dad.

21:16.540 --> 21:17.495
Hey, pal...

21:17.700 --> 21:20.658
...what do you say
we fix this place up together?

21:20.940 --> 21:23.135
- All right. Let's go get a burger first.
- Fine.

21:23.340 --> 21:25.900
- On me.
- All right.
