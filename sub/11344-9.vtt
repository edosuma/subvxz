(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:08.142 --> 00:11.612
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:11.645 --> 00:14.215
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:14.248 --> 00:16.117
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:16.150 --> 00:17.551
are members
of an elite squad

00:17.585 --> 00:19.587
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.689
These are their stories.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.193
(woman, screaming)
Ow!

00:25.226 --> 00:27.228
Don't!

00:27.261 --> 00:28.462
[loud smack]

00:28.496 --> 00:29.597
No!

00:29.630 --> 00:30.764
What's that noise?

00:30.798 --> 00:32.800
Who cares?
Turn it up.

00:32.833 --> 00:34.535
(woman)
No!

00:34.568 --> 00:36.537
No way can I do that.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.772
I gotta be in Buffalo
by tomorrow night.

00:38.806 --> 00:41.542
(woman)
Don't!

00:41.575 --> 00:42.676
Stop!

00:42.710 --> 00:44.212
Come on, hurry up.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.446
No!

00:45.479 --> 00:46.480
[glass smashes]

00:46.514 --> 00:47.481
Aaah!

00:47.515 --> 00:48.482
Aaah!

00:48.516 --> 00:50.318
Oh!

00:50.351 --> 00:52.620
Hey.
Hey!

00:52.653 --> 00:53.621
I already paid!

00:53.654 --> 00:55.589
(woman)
No!

00:55.623 --> 00:57.558
[body falls]

00:57.591 --> 00:58.826
What's going on?

00:58.859 --> 01:00.261
Hey!

01:01.729 --> 01:03.597
[groaning]

01:05.766 --> 01:07.201
Are you okay, honey?

01:07.235 --> 01:09.503
Help me.

01:09.537 --> 01:10.504
[phone buttons beeping]

01:10.538 --> 01:11.739
What about my 50 bucks?

01:11.772 --> 01:13.441
Go to hell!

01:13.474 --> 01:15.143
A girl's been attacked.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.144
(Fin)
Beaten, robbed,

01:16.177 --> 01:17.878
left half naked
on the floor.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.613
EMT took her
to Saint Vincent's.

01:19.647 --> 01:20.514
Elliot's on his way there.

01:20.548 --> 01:23.584
Hooker's the only one
that heard anything.

01:23.617 --> 01:24.452
He was hitting on her,

01:24.485 --> 01:25.519
and she was hollering,
"Stop, don't".

01:25.553 --> 01:27.788
When I went in, he ran out
past me with her purse.

01:27.821 --> 01:28.589
You see his face?

01:28.622 --> 01:30.658
Just a glimpse.
But he was white.

01:30.691 --> 01:32.260
Thank you.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.595
He beat her with the lamp.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.729
Perp was cold.

01:35.763 --> 01:38.632
Took off the bulb
and the shade first.

01:38.666 --> 01:39.633
You get an ID?

01:39.667 --> 01:42.136
No.
Probably in her purse.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.871
Manager said her name
is Jane Smith.

01:43.904 --> 01:45.906
(Benson)
You check her ID?

01:45.939 --> 01:47.675
Why should I?
She paid cash.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.343
She come in here
with anyone else?

01:49.377 --> 01:50.711
She checked in
about two weeks ago.

01:50.744 --> 01:51.779
She have any visitors?

01:51.812 --> 01:53.747
Heh.
It's none of my business.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.349
Your business is running
a whorehouse.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.351
You want us
to haul your ass in?

01:57.385 --> 01:59.853
All I know is she, uh,
made a bunch of calls

01:59.887 --> 02:01.255
from the payphone
in the lobby.

02:01.289 --> 02:02.690
[cell phone ringing]
Kept buggin' me

02:02.723 --> 02:04.525
for change.

02:04.558 --> 02:05.626
It's Elliot.

02:05.659 --> 02:08.429
Second the nurse's back was
turned, our girl grabbed

02:08.462 --> 02:10.398
some clothes
from the next bed...

02:10.431 --> 02:12.666
gray sweats,
a brown jersey.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.768
The she went for a walk
down the corridor--

02:14.802 --> 02:16.470
Pause that.

02:16.504 --> 02:18.472
Blow it up.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.508
[computer beeping]

02:23.311 --> 02:26.247
Then she slipped out
a side entrance.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.917
She's gone.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.237
(Stabler)
She told the E.R. her name
was Jane Smith,

03:23.271 --> 03:24.605
just like at the hotel.

03:24.638 --> 03:25.806
She walk out
under her own steam?

03:25.839 --> 03:27.275
Yeah, but the doc
said she took

03:27.308 --> 03:29.009
a helluva beating
to her thighs and torso.

03:29.042 --> 03:30.378
There was vaginal bleeding.

03:30.411 --> 03:31.545
So she could have
internal injuries.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.813
They do a rape kit?

03:32.846 --> 03:33.881
They only drew blood.

03:33.914 --> 03:35.549
She split before
they could finish.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.518
Well, it sounds like
she was turning a trick,

03:37.551 --> 03:38.519
John stole her purse.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.687
Maybe he's an addict.

03:39.720 --> 03:42.256
Or could be a pimp who roughed
her up for working his game.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.591
(Munch)
She hasn't been
working here long.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.259
CSU found
a one-way bus ticket

03:45.293 --> 03:46.694
crumpled in a wastebasket.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.463
Two weeks old
from Palassi, Virginia.

03:49.497 --> 03:50.631
Runaway.

03:50.664 --> 03:52.566
Comes to New York, uses up
her money, goes on the game.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.667
I faxed her E.R. photo

03:53.701 --> 03:55.369
to the sheriff in Palassi.

03:55.403 --> 03:56.870
It's a small town,
he knows her.

03:56.904 --> 03:59.039
Name is Lauren Westley, 16.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.009
Her dad filed a Missing Persons
report two days ago.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.445
Two weeks after his kid skips?
What was he waiting for?

04:04.478 --> 04:05.245
Don't know, I left a message

04:05.279 --> 04:06.580
on the home phone
for him to call.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.549
I dumped the roach motel's
payphone.

04:08.582 --> 04:10.284
Nothing too interesting
in the last

04:10.318 --> 04:12.586
two days except
for eight calls to

04:12.620 --> 04:14.822
the Manhattan Woman's
Sexual Health clinic.

04:14.855 --> 04:15.956
Doesn't exactly
narrow it down.

04:15.989 --> 04:18.492
I mean, you got 20 hookers
working out of that hotel.

04:18.526 --> 04:19.527
(Cragen)
The best lead we got.

04:19.560 --> 04:21.895
Let's check it out
first thing in the morning.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.734
(Stabler)
We're looking for this girl.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.637
Her name is Lauren Westley.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.740
Judy, give us a moment.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.742
I have seen her.

04:34.775 --> 04:38.612
She said her name
was Jane Smith.

04:38.646 --> 04:39.980
Did something happen
to her?

04:40.013 --> 04:41.081
She was attacked.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.385
Possibly sexually assaulted.

04:44.418 --> 04:45.719
Why did she
come here?

04:45.753 --> 04:46.720
I can't tell you that.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.622
Patient-doctor confidentiality.

04:48.656 --> 04:49.723
Well, you treat

04:49.757 --> 04:50.991
sexually transmitted diseases.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.059
Was that it?

04:52.092 --> 04:53.761
I'm sorry,
I can't say.

04:53.794 --> 04:55.963
Okay, Lauren's missing,
and she needs medical attention.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.498
I wish I could

04:57.531 --> 05:00.734
help you, but Lauren refused
to leave a phone number.

05:00.768 --> 05:02.870
Dr. Lett,
the E.R. drew blood.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.071
We can make them test it.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.806
Well, do what you have to.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.809
I promise if she contacts me,
I'll have her call you.

05:08.842 --> 05:11.979
You have a card?

05:12.012 --> 05:12.913
(Cragen)
Nothing from the patrols.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.483
Fin is out looking
with his Vice buddies.

05:15.516 --> 05:16.750
You still think Lauren
was hooking?

05:16.784 --> 05:18.786
Makes sense.
And now with the clinic--

05:18.819 --> 05:21.355
You know, John sees fresh meat,
he wants to ride bareback.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.990
Next thing, she's got
gonorrhea or chlamydia.

05:23.023 --> 05:25.626
Or worse,
syphilis or HIV.

05:25.659 --> 05:27.027
Any word from Lauren's dad?

05:27.060 --> 05:28.762
Duty officer said he called
at 2:00 a.m.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.063
after he got our message.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.965
Been here since 5:30.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.738
(Philip)
That's Lauren in the middle,
the blonde.

05:37.771 --> 05:39.106
It's the school choir.

05:39.139 --> 05:43.811
I thought the tape might help,
you know, for the media.

05:43.844 --> 05:44.978
It will.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.414
Mr. Westley,

05:46.447 --> 05:48.482
why'd you wait two weeks
to report her missing?

05:48.516 --> 05:51.151
She said she was coming here
to visit a friend's family

05:51.184 --> 05:52.520
and have a look at colleges.

05:52.553 --> 05:56.123
I put her on a bus.
Gave her some money.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.658
You didn't call
to make sure she's okay?

05:57.691 --> 05:58.726
She called me.

05:58.759 --> 06:02.062
Told me she was having fun.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.798
And then three days ago,
she stopped calling.

06:04.832 --> 06:07.735
I checked
with her friends, and...

06:07.768 --> 06:09.737
none of them
had even spoken to her.

06:09.770 --> 06:11.004
So I came here myself
and started looking.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.174
Could she have come here
with a boyfriend?

06:14.207 --> 06:15.843
Lauren doesn't date.

06:15.876 --> 06:17.177
You sound very sure.

06:17.210 --> 06:18.746
I am.

06:18.779 --> 06:20.814
She made the Golden Promise.

06:20.848 --> 06:24.051
(Stabler)
Golden Promise?
What's that?

06:24.084 --> 06:26.820
Kids pledge to abstain
from sexual activity

06:26.854 --> 06:27.921
until they're married.

06:27.955 --> 06:30.791
Oh.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.860
You know, Mr. Westley,

06:32.893 --> 06:36.797
sometimes kids run away
because there are, uh...

06:36.830 --> 06:38.432
problems at home.

06:38.466 --> 06:41.935
Well, Lauren's mother passed
away ten years ago.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.737
But it only made us closer.

06:43.771 --> 06:47.107
(Stabler)
Okay, well, we'll talk

06:47.140 --> 06:49.743
to her friends and see
if they know anything.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.812
Whatever you need to do.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.848
Please just find her.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.850
E.R. faxed over Lauren's
blood results.

06:56.884 --> 06:59.520
No sign of infection,
but her HCG was positive.

06:59.553 --> 07:00.320
She's pregnant.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.755
They tested
for hormone levels,

07:01.789 --> 07:03.757
and she's well into
her second trimester.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.826
Think she went to that clinic
to get an abortion.

07:05.859 --> 07:07.461
Explains why the doctor
won't talk to us.

07:07.495 --> 07:10.698
(Cragen)
Manhattan Woman's Sexual
Health Clinic listed

07:10.731 --> 07:12.132
under abortion services.

07:12.165 --> 07:14.735
So much for
the Golden Promise.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.936
(Munch)
Yeah, like that
was ever gonna work.

07:15.969 --> 07:17.004
One look

07:17.037 --> 07:19.473
at a Britney Spears video,
and the Golden Promise

07:19.507 --> 07:20.808
goes out the bedroom window.

07:20.841 --> 07:21.709
Abstinence is baloney.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.076
I read the number
of high school teenagers

07:23.110 --> 07:24.678
having sex has dropped.

07:24.712 --> 07:26.079
Well, I guess you haven't read
about the high school

07:26.113 --> 07:27.681
in Ohio where a fifth
of the students got pregnant.

07:27.715 --> 07:28.816
Guess what they were taught
in Sex Ed?

07:28.849 --> 07:32.085
You two can fight the cultural
wars on your own time.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.987
Why would somebody come
all the way to New York

07:34.021 --> 07:34.988
for an abortion?

07:35.022 --> 07:36.557
Because Virginia law

07:36.590 --> 07:38.225
requires teens get
parental consent

07:38.258 --> 07:39.927
before they terminate
a pregnancy.

07:39.960 --> 07:41.629
And if she's
Daddy's little girl,

07:41.662 --> 07:43.897
he's the last person
in the world she'd tell.

07:43.931 --> 07:45.899
Yeah, and you know who else
was in town last night?

07:47.300 --> 07:51.672
Pregnant.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.073
How long?

07:53.106 --> 07:55.876
Four or five months.

07:55.909 --> 07:59.980
She must've been raped.

08:00.013 --> 08:01.281
Some son-of-a-bitch
raped her.

08:01.314 --> 08:05.653
It's possible.

08:05.686 --> 08:06.954
Probably the guy
who beat her up.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.689
You have to catch
the bastard.

08:08.722 --> 08:10.190
You were in the city
last night.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.859
Where were you about 8:30?

08:11.892 --> 08:13.527
8:30, I--

08:18.599 --> 08:20.100
You think I would hurt
my own daughter?

08:20.133 --> 08:21.802
Did you?
No.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.203
So where were you
8:30 last night?

08:23.236 --> 08:26.807
I was having a bite to eat.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.508
I have the credit card receipt.

08:30.744 --> 08:31.879
My daughter was raped.

08:31.912 --> 08:33.013
And you people are actually
accusing me

08:33.046 --> 08:34.014
of attacking her?!

08:34.047 --> 08:35.949
[knock, door opens]

08:35.983 --> 08:37.951
Olivia, Fin needs you.

08:43.056 --> 08:44.625
(Fin)
Vice found Lauren hiding out

08:44.658 --> 08:45.659
in one of the cars.

08:45.693 --> 08:46.459
She's in a bad way.

08:46.493 --> 08:47.961
How did Vice know
where to look?

08:47.995 --> 08:50.130
Working girls use this place
when they're on the run.

08:50.163 --> 08:53.667
Smash out a window, at least
they got a place to sleep.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.235
There's blood
all over the seat.

08:55.268 --> 08:57.938
(Benson)
Attacker must've
caught up with her.

08:57.971 --> 09:01.241
Pick up her dad and bring him
to the hospital.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.342
How is she?

09:02.375 --> 09:04.211
(EMT)
Lost a lot of blood.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.245
I'll ride with her.

09:09.883 --> 09:10.984
(Benson)
Keep all of her clothes.

09:11.018 --> 09:12.052
We know the drill.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.687
Lauren, it's okay.

09:13.721 --> 09:14.922
You're at the hospital.

09:14.955 --> 09:15.723
I'm a police officer.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.190
Can you tell me
who did this to you?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.992
Later!

09:19.026 --> 09:20.694
(EMT)
15-year-old female,
possible internal hemorrhage.

09:20.728 --> 09:22.362
One liter saline
in the field.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.864
How is she?

09:23.897 --> 09:24.932
Don't know yet.

09:24.965 --> 09:25.899
What did CSU
get from the car?

09:25.933 --> 09:29.302
Some food. Wheat bread,
turkey, and tomatoes.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.004
Doesn't sound like
a hooker's chips and donuts.

09:31.038 --> 09:31.805
We even found a plate,

09:31.839 --> 09:33.941
plastic knife and fork,
and a rose.

09:33.974 --> 09:34.942
Where'd she buy
all that?

09:34.975 --> 09:37.044
We're canvassing
the local stores.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.045
[door opens]

09:38.078 --> 09:39.813
I'm her father.

09:39.847 --> 09:41.114
How is she?

09:41.148 --> 09:43.884
She has massive
internal bleeding.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.819
The beating lacerated
her liver, forming a blood clot.

09:45.853 --> 09:46.887
It burst today.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.121
If the detectives
hadn't found her

09:48.155 --> 09:49.189
when they did,
she would've died.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.891
We're about to send her up

09:50.924 --> 09:52.993
to the O.R.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.162
But the anesthesia will increase
the risk to the fetus.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.163
The baby's still alive?

09:56.196 --> 09:57.097
Has a heartbeat.

09:57.130 --> 09:58.331
But the drop in
the mother's blood pressure

09:58.365 --> 09:59.933
is causing fetal distress.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.802
If we start to lose the baby,

10:01.835 --> 10:04.171
do we have your permission
to do an emergency C-section?

10:04.204 --> 10:05.939
Will the baby survive?

10:05.973 --> 10:08.842
24 weeks...
40 or 50% chance.

10:08.876 --> 10:11.078
Save my daughter.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.880
She's crashing.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.014
Let's bag her.

10:25.826 --> 10:26.894
(Stabler)
The question is,

10:26.927 --> 10:28.061
if Lauren was here
for two weeks,

10:28.095 --> 10:29.329
why didn't she get
the abortion?

10:29.362 --> 10:31.164
Maybe she decided
to keep the baby.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.800
Which pissed
the baby's father off.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.301
Lauren made it.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.738
But the baby didn't.
It was stillborn, a girl.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.006
Go talk to the clinic.

10:39.039 --> 10:42.009
Find out if Lauren
went there by herself.

10:42.042 --> 10:44.144
We need to speak
with Dr. Lett.

10:44.177 --> 10:46.246
He's with a patient.
What's this about?

10:46.279 --> 10:47.848
Lauren Westley.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.917
We can't discuss
our patients.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.685
She lost her baby.
Someone battered it to death.

10:51.719 --> 10:54.154
Nearly killed Lauren
in the process.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.288
That's horrible.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.924
Now, did she
come in here alone?

10:56.957 --> 10:57.958
Yes.

11:00.027 --> 11:02.029
You better come in.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.734
Like many young women
in her position,

11:06.767 --> 11:09.136
Lauren wasn't sure
what she wanted to do.

11:09.169 --> 11:11.371
Was she being pressured
into having the abortion?

11:11.404 --> 11:12.372
I believe so.

11:12.405 --> 11:14.341
By the baby's father?

11:14.374 --> 11:15.809
She ever mention him?

11:15.843 --> 11:17.144
Only to say that he didn't
want the baby.

11:17.177 --> 11:19.947
As it turned out,
he had no choice.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.215
When I examined her,
I found that legally,

11:22.249 --> 11:23.717
I couldn't perform
the abortion.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.052
She was over 24 weeks.

11:25.085 --> 11:26.153
You're sure?

11:26.186 --> 11:27.821
I did an ultrasound

11:27.855 --> 11:29.256
and she told me
the date of conception.
[cell phone rings]

11:29.289 --> 11:31.024
How did Lauren react?

11:31.058 --> 11:32.025
Stabler.
She was upset,

11:32.059 --> 11:33.927
naturally.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.863
I encouraged her
to talk to her parents.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.098
When did you see her?

11:38.131 --> 11:39.132
Uh...

11:41.969 --> 11:43.203
Monday afternoon.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.272
The day she was attacked.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.241
It's Munch.
He's got something.

11:48.275 --> 11:50.010
We got security camera film
from the store

11:50.043 --> 11:52.746
three blocks from the parking
lot where Lauren was found.

11:52.780 --> 11:55.816
Shows a white kid,
16 or 17 buying food and drink.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.150
(Fin)
Exactly the same things

11:57.184 --> 11:58.852
that we found in the car
with Lauren.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.287
Here's the romantic bit--

12:00.320 --> 12:01.521
He bought her the rose.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.823
Classic batterer behavior--

12:02.856 --> 12:04.024
He nearly beats her to death,

12:04.057 --> 12:05.392
then buys her flowers
to say he's sorry.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.328
I'll fax his pretty mug out
to the sheriff in Palassi.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.997
I want to check
something first.

12:14.101 --> 12:15.235
It's the same kid.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.070
(Munch)
Two Golden Promises broken.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.038
We gotta get Lauren
to talk.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.107
While you're there,
ask her about her sister.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.242
Sheriff says
she used to have one.

12:22.275 --> 12:23.844
Used to?
What, is she dead?

12:23.877 --> 12:24.812
Good as.

12:24.845 --> 12:26.980
She got pregnant,
Dad threw her out the house.

12:27.014 --> 12:27.981
Just like that?

12:28.015 --> 12:29.116
Yeah, he gave her some money,

12:29.149 --> 12:32.052
said he never wanted
to see her again.

12:34.021 --> 12:35.388
Who is he, Lauren?

12:35.422 --> 12:40.027
His name's Wayne Mortens.
Did he do this?

12:40.060 --> 12:41.128
Did he rape you?

12:41.161 --> 12:42.295
I don't want
to talk about it.

12:42.329 --> 12:43.363
(Benson)
Lauren.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.965
You almost died.

12:44.998 --> 12:45.966
Tell them, sweetheart.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.035
Tell them what he did to you.

12:48.068 --> 12:49.870
Mr. Westley, please.
Why don't we go outside?

12:49.903 --> 12:52.039
I'm staying right here.

12:52.072 --> 12:53.907
No, let's talk outside.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.882
How well does Lauren
know Wayne?

13:01.915 --> 13:02.916
He's a year ahead of her.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.384
Gives her a ride
to school sometimes.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.120
He been in any trouble?

13:07.154 --> 13:09.122
His dad's in the Army,
his mother's a nurse.

13:09.156 --> 13:10.557
He's on his own a lot.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.225
What difference does it make?
He raped my daughter.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.560
You should be out there
looking for him.

13:13.593 --> 13:16.196
We don't know
that he did rape her.

13:16.229 --> 13:17.197
He got her pregnant.

13:17.230 --> 13:18.899
Mr. Westley,

13:18.932 --> 13:20.433
you gotta start considering
the possibility

13:20.467 --> 13:22.202
that Lauren had
consensual sex.

13:22.235 --> 13:25.973
Lauren would never do that.
She'd never betray me.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.041
What if she was too scared
to tell you?

13:28.075 --> 13:29.309
Why would she be
scared of me?

13:29.342 --> 13:32.145
After what you did
to her sister?

13:32.179 --> 13:35.082
Now, that's none
of your business.

13:35.115 --> 13:38.318
So why don't you just do your
damn job and catch the bastard?

13:38.351 --> 13:40.387
First we gotta find him.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.089
Do you have a number
for his parents?

13:42.122 --> 13:45.926
I have Wayne's
cell phone number.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.094
If I get stuck at work,

13:47.127 --> 13:50.130
I call him,
he gives Lauren a ride home.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.198
There.

13:51.231 --> 13:54.501
[buttons beeping]

13:54.534 --> 13:55.602
What are you doing?

13:55.635 --> 13:57.037
Calling him.

13:57.070 --> 14:00.040
Are you crazy?
You're gonna scare him off!

14:00.073 --> 14:01.174
Is that Wayne?

14:01.208 --> 14:04.211
Hey, this is Elliot Stabler
from St. Vincent's Hospital.

14:04.244 --> 14:07.214
Lauren asked me to call.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.182
She's doing fine.

14:09.216 --> 14:12.986
She's in room 210.

14:13.020 --> 14:16.023
(Benson)
Is Wayne the baby's father?

14:16.056 --> 14:17.090
Yes.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.593
Did he rape you?

14:20.627 --> 14:23.330
I don't want to talk
about it.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.431
Lauren...

14:24.464 --> 14:29.569
talking about it
is gonna help you.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.904
Did Wayne force you

14:30.938 --> 14:35.075
to have sex with him?

14:35.108 --> 14:38.278
We didn't mean
for it to happen.

14:40.981 --> 14:41.949
The nurse

14:41.982 --> 14:46.353
said that I had a little girl.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.188
I want to see her.

14:57.664 --> 14:58.966
I'm sorry.

14:58.999 --> 15:01.234
Please.

15:01.268 --> 15:02.402
The medical examiner

15:02.435 --> 15:05.105
took her away so they could
figure out what happened.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.510
Lauren.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.246
Did you want to keep
this baby?

15:16.316 --> 15:20.520
The doctor said
that I had to.

15:20.553 --> 15:24.324
That I was too far along.

15:24.357 --> 15:27.694
Wayne didn't want to hear that,
so he got angry.

15:27.727 --> 15:30.497
Yes.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.466
And he started hitting you.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.574
Um, hi, I'm looking
for room 210.

15:41.608 --> 15:44.511
Wayne Mortens?

15:44.544 --> 15:45.512
Hey.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.713
Hey, slow down!

15:50.017 --> 15:51.051
Police!
Stop him!

15:55.188 --> 15:57.457
Wayne Mortens,
you're under arrest.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.126
You have the right
to remain silent.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.160
If you give up that right,

16:00.193 --> 16:02.295
anything you say can and will
be used against you

16:02.329 --> 16:03.263
in a court of law.

16:03.296 --> 16:06.266
It's not looking
too good for you there, Wayne.

16:06.299 --> 16:08.501
Now, why'd you have Lauren's
wallet in your pocket

16:08.535 --> 16:10.270
when we caught you?

16:10.303 --> 16:13.040
Because you stole it
after you beat her so hard

16:13.073 --> 16:15.675
that you killed her baby.

16:15.708 --> 16:19.179
Why'd you want to get rid
of the baby?

16:19.212 --> 16:20.313
Did you make her come

16:20.347 --> 16:22.082
to New York
to get an abortion?

16:22.115 --> 16:23.350
(lawyer)
You don't have to answer that.

16:23.383 --> 16:25.085
(Benson)
The doctor tells you
it's too late to abort.

16:25.118 --> 16:28.155
You realize that you're
gonna be a daddy,

16:28.188 --> 16:29.522
so you took that lamp,
and you beat her--

16:29.556 --> 16:30.690
All right!
(lawyer)
Shut up, Wayne.

16:30.723 --> 16:31.691
It wasn't Lauren's fault.
Wayne--

16:31.724 --> 16:33.026
I did it, I hit her.

16:33.060 --> 16:37.264
I'd like to speak
to the ADA.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.766
(lawyer)
He's a decent kid who got

16:39.799 --> 16:41.801
caught up in a terrible
situation and panicked.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.303
(Benson)
He was calm enough

16:43.336 --> 16:45.205
to remove the bulb and the shade
from the lamp

16:45.238 --> 16:47.474
before he used it
to batter his girlfriend.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.277
Extreme emotional distress.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.312
Misdemeanor assault.
Five years probation.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.247
He killed a baby, Mr. Delroy.
That's murder.

16:54.281 --> 16:55.482
The fetus was stillborn.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.284
That's not even a person
under New York law.

16:57.317 --> 16:58.218
So you can't charge him
with murder.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.220
At the very least,
your client committed

17:00.253 --> 17:01.521
first degree assault
against Lauren

17:01.554 --> 17:02.755
and an unjustified abortional

17:02.789 --> 17:04.524
act on the fetus.

17:04.557 --> 17:07.694
I am taking this to trial.

17:07.727 --> 17:09.429
And if the autopsy proves

17:09.462 --> 17:11.664
that that baby took a single
breath outside the womb,

17:11.698 --> 17:14.301
I will charge Wayne
with murder.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.312
The fetus had a fractured skull
and multiple contusions

17:25.345 --> 17:27.080
consistent with a beating.

17:27.114 --> 17:28.515
More than 20 blows.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.683
20 blows, but only
a fractured skull?

17:30.717 --> 17:33.253
Baby's bones are still forming,
so they're hard to break.

17:33.286 --> 17:34.787
What was the cause of death?

17:34.821 --> 17:36.856
Technically,
it was hypertension.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.792
The mother's internal bleeding
decreased the blood flow

17:39.826 --> 17:41.761
across the placenta
to the fetus.

17:41.794 --> 17:43.763
No blood, no oxygen.
The baby suffocated.

17:43.796 --> 17:44.731
As a result
of Wayne's beating.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.699
Yes.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.702
Did the baby draw breath
after it was born?

17:49.736 --> 17:52.105
I did a hydrostatic test
on the lungs.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.640
The alveoli had not expanded.

17:53.673 --> 17:55.808
She was dead before she left
her mother's body.

17:55.842 --> 17:57.777
So according to New York law,
she's not a person.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.712
And you can't charge Wayne
with murder.

17:59.746 --> 18:00.880
There is something else.

18:00.913 --> 18:04.417
I checked Lauren's
hospital records.

18:04.451 --> 18:07.254
They took photos of the bruising
on her abdomen.

18:07.287 --> 18:08.655
The bruising match
the lamp?

18:08.688 --> 18:10.190
Mostly.

18:10.223 --> 18:12.525
Are you saying another person
was involved?

18:12.559 --> 18:14.894
Or another weapon.
So I checked with CSU.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.797
They didn't find anything
matching these marks.

18:17.830 --> 18:19.766
Could be a watch
or a bracelet.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.701
Wayne wasn't wearing
any jewelry.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.336
I mean, look at this.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.505
The only way to raise
a bump like that

18:25.538 --> 18:29.776
is you would have to be...

18:29.809 --> 18:33.346
hitting yourself.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.848
Lauren, did you try to stop
Wayne from attacking you?

18:35.882 --> 18:37.417
Yes.
Can't this wait?

18:37.450 --> 18:39.752
My father's just renting a car.
He'll be back soon.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.521
You were pretty scared.

18:41.554 --> 18:42.755
Is that why you ran away
from the E.R.,

18:42.789 --> 18:43.890
to get away from Wayne?

18:43.923 --> 18:45.725
Yes.

18:45.758 --> 18:47.694
Well, then why did you let him
buy you food

18:47.727 --> 18:49.729
when you were hiding
in the car?

18:49.762 --> 18:51.264
He found me.

18:51.298 --> 18:52.432
Really?

18:52.465 --> 18:55.302
It's a pretty big city.
How'd he do that?

18:55.335 --> 18:56.536
I don't know.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.938
You don't know?
You called him.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.241
You called him, Lauren.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.842
After he nearly
beat you to death.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.677
Look, I didn't know
what else to do.

19:04.711 --> 19:07.814
I was hurting so bad.
I don't have anyone else.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.316
Please just leave me alone.

19:09.349 --> 19:10.850
What the hell is this?

19:10.883 --> 19:12.285
Just asking Lauren
a few questions.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.653
What else is there to ask?

19:13.686 --> 19:14.721
Lauren, did you try
to harm your baby?

19:14.754 --> 19:15.922
Of course she didn't.

19:15.955 --> 19:17.757
Did you?
No.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.794
(Benson)
Lauren.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.264
Do you always wear
this watch?

19:24.297 --> 19:25.298
Yes.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.299
(Philip)
What does that have to do

19:26.333 --> 19:27.234
with anything?

19:27.267 --> 19:30.470
Matches the bruise pattern
on your stomach.

19:30.503 --> 19:32.539
Those photos
were taken at the E.R.

19:32.572 --> 19:35.842
There were seven points
of contact.

19:35.875 --> 19:38.345
You hit yourself.

19:42.582 --> 19:44.884
I'm sorry.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.254
(Stabler)
And then you had Wayne hit you?

19:47.287 --> 19:50.757
Yes.

19:50.790 --> 19:53.893
The eyewitness said that you
were yelling, "Stop, don't".

19:56.829 --> 20:00.767
God forgive me,
I was saying, "Don't stop".

20:05.037 --> 20:07.374
Daddy!
Please--

20:11.778 --> 20:12.845
Mr. Westley,
where are you going?

20:12.879 --> 20:14.714
Home.
What about your daughter?

20:14.747 --> 20:16.916
Keep her, lock her up.
I don't care.

20:16.949 --> 20:18.918
Unfortunately,
children aren't disposable.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.420
They deserted me.

20:20.453 --> 20:22.922
They're kids.
Lauren's 16.

20:22.955 --> 20:23.923
She made a promise.

20:23.956 --> 20:25.425
She's your child.

20:27.494 --> 20:28.995
I don't care
what your beliefs are.

20:29.028 --> 20:30.697
You don't stop loving her.

20:30.730 --> 20:31.698
Like I know you
don't stop thinking

20:31.731 --> 20:32.732
about your other daughter.

20:39.406 --> 20:40.940
Lauren tried
to kill her baby.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.975
Because she was
afraid of you.

20:45.878 --> 20:47.980
Don't prove her right.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.923
My God.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.892
[sighs]

20:59.926 --> 21:02.061
What's gonna happen
to her?

21:02.094 --> 21:04.364
That's up to the DA.

21:10.670 --> 21:11.838
Miss DeVere.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.873
Didn't expect to see you
slumming out here.

21:13.906 --> 21:15.775
I'm representing
Wayne Mortens.

21:15.808 --> 21:16.809
You come to offer a deal?

21:16.843 --> 21:19.579
To see if he'll corroborate
Lauren's confession.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.913
Ooh, congratulations.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.882
You finally realized
she's complicit.

21:22.915 --> 21:25.051
So you gonna charge her too?

21:25.084 --> 21:27.820
Depends what Wayne has to say.

21:27.854 --> 21:31.924
We know Lauren was involved.
We know she hit herself.

21:31.958 --> 21:34.461
Just tell me
whose idea it was.

21:36.829 --> 21:37.997
Tell her, Wayne.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.636
Lauren's.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.608
Why?

21:54.514 --> 21:58.050
When the doctor said

21:58.084 --> 22:00.887
that it was too late
to get the abortion,

22:00.920 --> 22:03.923
she came back to the hotel.

22:03.956 --> 22:07.860
She was hysterical.

22:07.894 --> 22:10.096
She said that her dad would
throw her out

22:10.129 --> 22:11.664
like he did to her sister.

22:14.166 --> 22:15.835
What happened then?

22:19.939 --> 22:22.375
She said that we had to do it.

22:22.409 --> 22:24.577
That we had to get rid
of the baby.

22:24.611 --> 22:27.046
She told me
to use the lamp.

22:29.582 --> 22:33.753
She made me take off the shade
and the bulb.

22:33.786 --> 22:36.989
She laid down on the bed.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.525
And she told me to start--

22:38.558 --> 22:41.428
(Novak)
Hitting her?

22:41.461 --> 22:42.662
I couldn't.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.097
Lauren was crying.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.232
And she started

22:46.265 --> 22:49.035
hitting herself, and she was
like, "Come on! Come on!"

22:49.068 --> 22:50.837
And you did.

22:55.908 --> 22:56.943
Yeah.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.905
Casey, they're kids.

23:25.938 --> 23:27.073
They're emotionally devastated.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.975
They're not in control
of their actions.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.877
On the contrary.

23:30.910 --> 23:33.680
They made a plan,
and they executed it.

23:33.713 --> 23:36.616
It was Lauren's plan.

23:36.649 --> 23:39.018
She didn't force Wayne
to hit her, but he still did.

23:39.051 --> 23:41.087
Not once, but 20 times

23:41.120 --> 23:43.756
until the lamp shattered.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.525
Lauren hit the baby too.

23:45.558 --> 23:48.628
And I'm going
to charge them both.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.029
Which means you charge her
with a misdemeanor

23:50.062 --> 23:52.665
and him with a felony?

23:52.699 --> 23:57.904
Gee.
Does that seem fair to you?

24:00.507 --> 24:01.741
(Novak)
It's complicated.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.142
Both kids committed the same
crime, but according

24:03.175 --> 24:05.144
to the law, he could get
five years in prison

24:05.177 --> 24:07.013
while she gets
five years probation.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.481
Doesn't seem fair.

24:08.515 --> 24:10.683
Who's the primary cause
of the baby's death?

24:10.717 --> 24:11.618
The boy,

24:11.651 --> 24:14.654
but the girl incited
and abetted the act.

24:14.687 --> 24:18.958
The law's penalty reflects
the degree of responsibility.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.126
Seems fair to me.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.928
Plead her out
on a misdemeanor,

24:21.961 --> 24:24.063
and prosecute him
for the felony.

24:24.096 --> 24:25.031
[knocking at door]

24:25.064 --> 24:26.999
Sophie, you're working late.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.769
All for a good cause,
Arthur, all for a good cause.

24:29.802 --> 24:32.071
Women's rights.
You remember them.

24:32.104 --> 24:33.540
You know, a lot of people
in this country

24:33.573 --> 24:34.941
want to take us back
to the '50s.

24:34.974 --> 24:38.678
And look what we got now.
A '50s crime.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.279
Are you forgetting that
it's your male client

24:40.312 --> 24:42.248
who committed the crime?

24:42.281 --> 24:44.150
As a matter of fact,
I haven't.

24:44.183 --> 24:46.786
A motion to dismiss the charges
against Wayne Mortens

24:46.819 --> 24:48.821
on constitutional grounds.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.022
What kind of nonsense is this?

24:50.056 --> 24:51.223
There's no constitutional
issue here.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.125
Why, Arthur,
have you forgotten

24:53.159 --> 24:55.027
the 14th amendment?

24:55.061 --> 24:57.196
The law treats Wayne Mortens
and Lauren Westley

24:57.229 --> 24:58.831
differently because
of their gender.

24:58.865 --> 25:03.169
That violates
the equal protection clause.

25:07.273 --> 25:08.975
Who's your trial judge?

25:09.008 --> 25:11.177
Elizabeth Donnelly.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.679
[sighs]

25:12.712 --> 25:14.013
Our favorite radical feminist.

25:14.046 --> 25:16.015
Wears her views
on her sleeve.

25:16.048 --> 25:18.718
This would probably appeal
to her notion

25:18.751 --> 25:20.019
of inequality.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.989
I want you to talk
to Donnelly.

25:23.022 --> 25:25.124
Tell her to recuse herself
from this case.

25:25.157 --> 25:27.026
On what grounds?

25:27.059 --> 25:28.327
Public views on abortion.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.663
I think she's perfectly
capable of divorcing

25:30.697 --> 25:32.198
her personal beliefs
from the case.

25:32.231 --> 25:33.265
I'm not willing

25:33.299 --> 25:34.567
to take that risk.

25:34.601 --> 25:35.735
Talk to her, Casey,

25:35.768 --> 25:39.171
and tell her we can do it
unofficially or officially.

25:41.140 --> 25:42.108
(Donnelly)
Are you asking

25:42.141 --> 25:44.076
me to recuse myself?

25:44.110 --> 25:46.145
I'm sorry, but your public
position on abortion rights,

25:46.178 --> 25:47.947
your work for NARAL,
make it impossible

25:47.980 --> 25:48.981
for you to appear impartial.

25:49.015 --> 25:52.118
I'm against detention
without trial at Guantanamo,

25:52.151 --> 25:54.921
I can still try
terrorism cases.

25:54.954 --> 25:57.657
Your presence will also
politicize the case.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.826
It's gonna provide fuel
for the pro-life lobby.

25:59.859 --> 26:02.662
My absence will provide fuel
for the pro-choice lobby,

26:02.695 --> 26:05.297
which still exists, Casey,
even if you've deserted it.

26:05.331 --> 26:08.968
It's my job to prosecute this
case, regardless of my views.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.136
And it's my job
to try it.

26:10.169 --> 26:13.105
I see no reason at all why
I should accede to your request,

26:13.139 --> 26:16.242
so tell your boss
to go screw himself.

26:16.275 --> 26:18.110
Elizabeth.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.880
If I have to make

26:20.913 --> 26:25.017
this request official,
you know I'll win.

26:25.051 --> 26:26.919
Please don't make me do that.

26:34.827 --> 26:37.296
Are you threatening me?

26:37.329 --> 26:40.800
No.

26:40.833 --> 26:43.903
I'm asking you as a friend.

26:45.672 --> 26:50.142
Branch really got to you,
didn't he?

26:50.176 --> 26:51.944
All right.

26:51.978 --> 26:54.180
I'll recuse myself.

26:54.213 --> 26:56.816
Playing politics
with the law, Casey.

26:56.849 --> 27:02.288
You're heading down
a slippery slope.

27:10.763 --> 27:12.765
I hear Donnelly recused herself
from the case.

27:12.799 --> 27:14.400
Know anything about that?

27:14.433 --> 27:15.501
Elizabeth and I go back
a long way.

27:15.534 --> 27:18.237
Maybe she didn't want
to give me an unfair advantage.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.405
Or maybe you and Branch
mugged her,

27:19.438 --> 27:22.274
because you were afraid she was
gonna throw out your case.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.843
If your motion depends
on getting Donnelly,

27:23.876 --> 27:26.779
you can't have much
of an argument.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.749
Well, we'll see.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.450
(DeVere)
Lauren and Wayne committed
the same crime.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.986
They should be charged
with the same crime.

27:34.020 --> 27:36.288
To do otherwise is to give
Lauren preferential treatment,

27:36.322 --> 27:37.790
because she's female.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.191
Lauren's gender is the issue,
Your Honor.

27:39.225 --> 27:40.459
Pregnant women are

27:40.492 --> 27:42.762
under more stress,
especially if they're 16.

27:42.795 --> 27:44.030
Women only a little older
than Lauren

27:44.063 --> 27:46.198
are fighting
and dying in Iraq.

27:46.232 --> 27:48.935
To argue that--that a pregnant
woman is not mature enough

27:48.968 --> 27:50.837
to face the consequences
of her action

27:50.870 --> 27:52.805
is sexist and offensive.

27:52.839 --> 27:53.773
Well, that's odd.

27:53.806 --> 27:55.742
Miss DeVere has argued
the exact opposite.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.176
In four previous cases,

27:57.209 --> 27:58.477
she's used the stress
of pregnancy

27:58.510 --> 28:00.312
to defend a woman's
violent criminal actions.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.147
In the case at hand,

28:01.180 --> 28:03.482
the law is constitutionally
defective

28:03.515 --> 28:05.885
and violates my client's
civil rights.

28:05.918 --> 28:06.753
I'm sorry, Miss DeVere,

28:06.786 --> 28:07.887
but if you think
the law is defective,

28:07.920 --> 28:10.757
take it up with the legislature
or the Appeals Court.

28:10.790 --> 28:11.690
Your client

28:11.724 --> 28:14.293
is facing serious
criminal charges.

28:14.326 --> 28:17.496
The trial will proceed.
Good night.

28:17.529 --> 28:18.998
One more thing,
Your Honor.

28:19.031 --> 28:19.866
I would move that
in the trial,

28:19.899 --> 28:21.901
the fetus be referred
to as the fetus,

28:21.934 --> 28:23.736
not "the unborn child"

28:23.770 --> 28:24.737
or "the baby".

28:24.771 --> 28:25.938
These emotive terms are

28:25.972 --> 28:27.106
deeply prejudicial
for my client.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.507
This is outrageous,
Your Honor.

28:28.540 --> 28:29.776
The baby was more
than 24 weeks old.

28:29.809 --> 28:30.777
It could've lived

28:30.810 --> 28:31.944
outside the womb.

28:31.978 --> 28:33.512
(DeVere)
But tragically it did not,

28:33.545 --> 28:36.783
so it is not a person,
not a baby, not an unborn child.

28:36.816 --> 28:38.184
It is a fetus.

28:38.217 --> 28:40.286
My client is already handicapped
by the law.

28:40.319 --> 28:42.054
Let's not add insult
to injury.

28:42.088 --> 28:44.490
The only insult
is to the English language.

28:44.523 --> 28:46.358
(Judge)
I agree, Miss Novak.

28:46.392 --> 28:48.961
But I also agree
it is prejudicial.

28:48.995 --> 28:52.932
The dead baby will only be
referred to as "the fetus".

28:57.569 --> 28:59.171
(Novak)
Dr. Warner,

28:59.205 --> 29:00.506
how much force would it take

29:00.539 --> 29:02.875
to fracture the skull
of this fetus?

29:02.909 --> 29:05.211
(Warner)
A considerable amount
of force,

29:05.244 --> 29:06.979
since the bones
are not fully calcified.

29:07.013 --> 29:08.347
Would the 20 separate

29:08.380 --> 29:09.849
blows Wayne Mortens inflicted

29:09.882 --> 29:11.918
have caused the victim
to feel pain?

29:11.951 --> 29:14.020
Objection.
Relevance?

29:14.053 --> 29:17.890
The suffering of the victim
isn't relevant?

29:17.924 --> 29:19.558
The fetus is not a person
under the law.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.027
How can it be a victim?

29:21.060 --> 29:22.929
If the defendant had tortured
a cat or a dog,

29:22.962 --> 29:26.065
the jury would want to know the
degree of the victim's pain.

29:26.098 --> 29:28.868
Does a human fetus have
fewer rights?

29:28.901 --> 29:30.970
I'll allow the question.

29:31.003 --> 29:32.939
I have a further objection.

29:32.972 --> 29:36.008
It clearly states
in the Journal of the American

29:36.042 --> 29:38.344
Medical Association
that a fetus does not feel

29:38.377 --> 29:40.913
pain until after
the 29th week.

29:40.947 --> 29:41.814
And other

29:41.848 --> 29:43.883
studies show that
the fetus feels pain

29:43.916 --> 29:45.551
as early as 23 weeks.

29:45.584 --> 29:48.387
The conclusions of that study
are still being debated.

29:48.420 --> 29:49.255
Then until they're settled,

29:49.288 --> 29:51.157
we will not debate them
in my courtroom.

29:51.190 --> 29:52.158
Objection is sustained.

29:52.191 --> 29:55.327
Dr. Warner,

29:55.361 --> 29:57.463
did the defendant's attack

29:57.496 --> 29:59.298
cause the death of the fetus?

29:59.331 --> 30:00.466
Yes.

30:00.499 --> 30:02.234
Thank you.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.206
Dr. Warner,

30:07.239 --> 30:08.841
I have two photos

30:08.875 --> 30:11.844
from Lauren Westley's
hospital records.

30:11.878 --> 30:15.014
What do these show?

30:15.047 --> 30:18.985
Bruises and abrasions
to her abdomen.

30:19.018 --> 30:22.321
Caused by the lamp?

30:22.354 --> 30:23.856
No.

30:23.890 --> 30:28.060
Caused by what?

30:28.094 --> 30:29.929
By this?

30:29.962 --> 30:32.331
Yes.

30:32.364 --> 30:35.334
Let the record show that
the witness has identified

30:35.367 --> 30:37.069
Lauren Westley's watch.

30:39.906 --> 30:43.876
So it wasn't just Wayne
who attacked the fetus.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.912
It was the mother as well.

30:45.945 --> 30:49.048
Yes.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.950
No further questions.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.055
(DeVere)
How often did you and Wayne
have sex?

30:56.088 --> 30:57.957
Once.

30:57.990 --> 30:59.225
We didn't mean for it to happen.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.393
It just did.

31:01.427 --> 31:02.561
(DeVere)
And when was it

31:02.594 --> 31:04.563
that you knew
you were pregnant?

31:04.596 --> 31:05.564
Not until

31:05.597 --> 31:08.167
about 13 weeks later

31:08.200 --> 31:09.969
when I missed
my third period.

31:10.002 --> 31:11.470
Then why didn't you
tell somebody?

31:11.503 --> 31:13.372
Your doctor or your father?

31:21.080 --> 31:22.915
I was afraid.

31:22.949 --> 31:27.119
Afraid of what?

31:27.153 --> 31:29.255
My father.

31:29.288 --> 31:31.657
That he'd throw me
out of the house.

31:31.690 --> 31:34.026
I knew I couldn't take care
of a baby on my own.

31:34.060 --> 31:35.461
There are legal ways

31:35.494 --> 31:37.163
to terminate a pregnancy.

31:37.196 --> 31:38.530
Did you consider them?

31:38.564 --> 31:40.166
Yes.

31:40.199 --> 31:41.467
I tried to buy
the abortion pill,

31:41.500 --> 31:43.102
but the pharmacist
wouldn't sell it.

31:43.135 --> 31:46.038
Why not?

31:46.072 --> 31:50.309
He said it was
against his conscience.

31:50.342 --> 31:51.310
We went

31:51.343 --> 31:53.612
to the hospital, but...

31:53.645 --> 31:56.448
they said that they needed
my father's consent.

31:56.482 --> 31:59.118
And you were too afraid
to tell him.

31:59.151 --> 32:01.653
And then I read
on the Internet

32:01.687 --> 32:05.091
about this herb that could
cause an abortion.

32:05.124 --> 32:08.494
But it just made me
really sick.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.330
And then you came
to New York.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.199
I called a clinic.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.167
It was the first ad I saw
in the phone book,

32:15.201 --> 32:17.136
and they seemed nice.

32:17.169 --> 32:18.437
But...

32:18.470 --> 32:20.973
by the time I saw the doctor,

32:21.007 --> 32:24.510
he said I was past 24 weeks.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.079
And that it was too late.

32:27.113 --> 32:31.083
I had no way out.

32:31.117 --> 32:34.220
I wanted to kill myself.

32:38.124 --> 32:42.094
I told Wayne
to start hitting me.

32:42.128 --> 32:48.034
[crying]

32:48.067 --> 32:51.737
He did it,
because I asked him to.

32:51.770 --> 32:55.574
And now Wayne is on trial,
and you are free.

32:55.607 --> 32:57.109
Does that seem fair to you?

32:57.143 --> 32:58.444
Objection.

33:00.046 --> 33:03.049
No further questions.

33:03.082 --> 33:05.417
That is a pretty sad story,
Lauren.

33:05.451 --> 33:07.519
It almost seems
as if you had no choice

33:07.553 --> 33:08.687
but to batter your fetus
to death.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.190
(DeVere)
Is there a question here,
Your Honor?

33:11.223 --> 33:13.225
There is.

33:13.259 --> 33:15.294
You did have a choice,
didn't you?

33:15.327 --> 33:18.230
You could've told your dad.

33:18.264 --> 33:20.732
I was afraid of what he would do
if he knew.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.134
But he knows now,

33:22.168 --> 33:23.235
and where is he?

33:23.269 --> 33:24.603
He's here,

33:24.636 --> 33:26.372
in the courtroom,
supporting you.

33:26.405 --> 33:28.374
And what about
the abortion clinic?

33:28.407 --> 33:31.410
You were in New York two weeks
before you went there.

33:31.443 --> 33:33.445
You could've gotten
a legal abortion then.

33:33.479 --> 33:34.546
Why wait?

33:34.580 --> 33:35.581
I didn't wait.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.117
I went to the clinic
the first day I got here.

33:38.150 --> 33:41.187
Why not get the abortion then?

33:41.220 --> 33:42.654
Were you having
second thoughts?

33:42.688 --> 33:45.557
The nurse said
that I had a temperature,

33:45.591 --> 33:46.792
that they couldn't do

33:46.825 --> 33:47.759
the procedure.

33:47.793 --> 33:50.396
She said to call back
when I felt better.

33:50.429 --> 33:53.299
Did you?

33:53.332 --> 33:55.534
Yes.

33:55.567 --> 33:58.437
But by the time I got the
appointment, it was too late.

34:02.274 --> 34:04.276
Nothing further.

34:04.310 --> 34:05.744
(Judge)
The witness may step down.

34:05.777 --> 34:08.180
Court is adjourned
until tomorrow morning.

34:08.214 --> 34:10.082
Two visits
to the abortion clinic?

34:10.116 --> 34:11.617
Why the hell didn't we
know about this?

34:11.650 --> 34:14.052
The kids never mentioned it,
neither did the doctor.

34:16.655 --> 34:20.259
(Benson)
Dr. Lett, did you see Lauren
the first time she came in?

34:20.292 --> 34:21.093
I'll have to check.

34:21.127 --> 34:23.162
We see dozens
of women every day.

34:23.195 --> 34:24.396
While you're looking,

34:24.430 --> 34:26.498
check the fever Lauren was
supposed to have.

34:26.532 --> 34:28.334
We spoke to her.
She said she felt fine.

34:28.367 --> 34:30.202
Huh, who do you believe?

34:30.236 --> 34:33.439
A scared teenager
or a doctor with a thermometer?

34:33.472 --> 34:35.674
Well, here's her file.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.876
Uh...

34:37.909 --> 34:40.479
Yes, she had a fever of 102.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.148
So you did examine her?

34:42.181 --> 34:45.184
Yes, and I told her
that performing the procedure

34:45.217 --> 34:46.685
while she had
an infection would, uh,

34:46.718 --> 34:47.719
pose a great risk to her.

34:47.753 --> 34:49.555
And who was the nurse?

34:49.588 --> 34:51.590
[papers shuffling]

34:51.623 --> 34:53.159
Judy Galton.

34:53.192 --> 34:55.194
(Benson)
We're gonna need
to talk to her.

34:55.227 --> 35:00.232
Unfortunately, um,
Judy recently left us.

35:00.266 --> 35:01.700
This work can be very stressful.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.735
Why did it take you so long
to see her

35:03.769 --> 35:05.471
again after her first visit?

35:05.504 --> 35:09.241
Well, she was told to call
and make a new appointment.

35:09.275 --> 35:11.543
Uh, looks like she just took her
time getting back to us.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.245
No, Lauren called you
every day

35:13.279 --> 35:15.814
at least three times a day
for two weeks.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.283
We dumped the hotel payphone.

35:17.316 --> 35:20.252
Well, if it was a payphone,

35:20.286 --> 35:21.920
how do you know
it was Lauren calling?

35:21.953 --> 35:24.623
Does it normally take two weeks
to schedule an appointment?

35:24.656 --> 35:26.192
We're very busy.

35:26.225 --> 35:27.493
Or did it only take

35:27.526 --> 35:29.261
two weeks because you wanted
to delay her

35:29.295 --> 35:31.697
till it was too late to have
a legal abortion?

35:33.965 --> 35:36.468
That's an outrageous accusation.

35:36.502 --> 35:40.206
And quite unprovable.

35:40.239 --> 35:41.173
(Novak)
We checked with Medicaid.

35:41.207 --> 35:41.973
There's no record
of this clinic

35:42.007 --> 35:43.875
ever performing
a single procedure.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.278
It's one of those fake
abortion clinics.

35:46.312 --> 35:48.714
Apparently, they're springing up
all over the country.

35:48.747 --> 35:51.250
I didn't expect
to see them here.

35:51.283 --> 35:53.519
They're trying to clean up
Sodom and Gomorrah.

35:53.552 --> 35:55.554
You know the minute I put
that doctor on the stand

35:55.587 --> 35:56.622
the jury's gonna be
on my side.

35:56.655 --> 35:57.489
It may be hard

35:57.523 --> 35:59.225
for you to prove fraud,
but it does look

35:59.258 --> 36:00.292
like he deliberately
misled Lauren.

36:00.326 --> 36:04.296
If I get her medical records
to show your M.E...

36:04.330 --> 36:05.897
will you deal?

36:05.931 --> 36:07.399
Would you please excuse us,
Sophie?

36:10.402 --> 36:11.837
Why, certainly.

36:16.275 --> 36:17.243
Why are you making a deal?

36:17.276 --> 36:20.379
Lauren Westley was given
fraudulent information

36:20.412 --> 36:21.680
by a doctor masquerading

36:21.713 --> 36:23.382
as a provider
of abortion services.

36:23.415 --> 36:24.383
Did he instruct

36:24.416 --> 36:25.584
her to get her boyfriend

36:25.617 --> 36:27.219
to batter her baby to death?

36:27.253 --> 36:28.220
No.

36:28.254 --> 36:29.388
Did he assist them?

36:29.421 --> 36:31.523
He forced them into a corner.

36:31.557 --> 36:33.459
Does that justify battering her?

36:33.492 --> 36:34.526
No deals, Casey.

36:34.560 --> 36:36.228
Do your job.
Prosecute the crime.

36:36.262 --> 36:37.663
I am already losing the jury.

36:37.696 --> 36:38.797
With this new information,
I don't--

36:38.830 --> 36:39.798
You know what's
more important

36:39.831 --> 36:41.900
than winning or losing?

36:41.933 --> 36:44.903
Sending a message that this city
won't condone violent crime

36:44.936 --> 36:46.672
whatever the duress.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.379
Sounds like you don't agree
with your boss's orders.

36:53.412 --> 36:56.415
Even if I win, I'll feel like
I convicted the wrong person.

36:56.448 --> 36:57.716
Lauren and Wayne
killed that baby,

36:57.749 --> 36:58.917
whatever it's called in court.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.786
But they tried every legal
method to abort,

37:00.819 --> 37:02.788
even a medieval
herbal remedy.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.590
They were blocked
every single time.

37:04.623 --> 37:06.958
Dr. Lett was their last resort,
and he lied to them.

37:06.992 --> 37:08.660
I spoke with the nurse
who saw Lauren.

37:08.694 --> 37:11.330
She corroborates his story.
We can't prove anything.

37:11.363 --> 37:14.333
Maybe this'll help.
Lauren's records.

37:14.366 --> 37:17.336
Since when does a doctor
in a busy clinic

37:17.369 --> 37:18.404
take a patient's temperature

37:18.437 --> 37:19.405
and blood pressure?

37:19.438 --> 37:20.406
I wouldn't.

37:20.439 --> 37:21.840
The nurse does it.
Yes.

37:21.873 --> 37:22.841
And the nurse

37:22.874 --> 37:25.344
charts the results
in her notes.

37:25.377 --> 37:27.012
But her notes are missing.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.647
There's only Dr. Lett's
signature.

37:28.680 --> 37:31.750
I wanna talk
to that nurse.

37:36.422 --> 37:37.723
(Novak)
Did you work at the

37:37.756 --> 37:39.525
Manhattan Woman's
Sexual Health Clinic?

37:39.558 --> 37:41.327
Yes.

37:41.360 --> 37:42.728
Did you examine Lauren Westley

37:42.761 --> 37:44.530
on her first visit
to the clinic?

37:44.563 --> 37:46.432
Yes.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.034
You must see dozens
of patients.

37:49.067 --> 37:50.502
How can you be sure?

37:50.536 --> 37:53.639
I would never forget Lauren.

37:53.672 --> 37:57.909
Not after
what happened to her.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.978
Did you take
her temperature?

38:00.011 --> 38:01.313
Yes.

38:01.347 --> 38:03.315
Thank you.

38:03.349 --> 38:06.985
Your witness.

38:13.024 --> 38:16.027
What was her temperature?

38:16.061 --> 38:17.763
It was normal.
98.6.

38:17.796 --> 38:21.467
In the chart it says
that it was 102.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.336
The chart is incorrect.

38:24.370 --> 38:30.509
But you told Lauren
that she had a fever.

38:30.542 --> 38:32.978
Yes.

38:33.011 --> 38:35.013
You lied.

38:35.046 --> 38:36.582
It was what I was
told to do.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.650
By whom?

38:38.684 --> 38:41.487
Dr. Lett.

38:41.520 --> 38:42.320
Why?

38:42.354 --> 38:46.725
To delay performing
the abortion.

38:46.758 --> 38:49.528
For how long?

38:52.831 --> 38:55.467
Until it was too late.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.538
Why did you leave the clinic?

38:59.571 --> 39:04.743
I'm against abortion.

39:04.776 --> 39:07.546
When all we did
was try to persuade

39:07.579 --> 39:09.648
women and girls not
to abort their babies,

39:09.681 --> 39:11.917
I was fine.

39:11.950 --> 39:15.020
But then there were things
I didn't agree with.

39:15.053 --> 39:17.623
Like...

39:17.656 --> 39:18.824
what we did to Lauren.

39:18.857 --> 39:24.530
[crying]
She called every single day,

39:24.563 --> 39:27.566
asking when she
could come in.

39:30.035 --> 39:34.473
I dreaded hearing her voice
on the phone,

39:34.506 --> 39:37.743
but I kept lying to her.

39:37.776 --> 39:41.112
Why?

39:41.146 --> 39:43.381
Dr. Lett told me to.

39:57.729 --> 39:59.397
Will the defendant please stand?

40:01.066 --> 40:04.035
On the misdemeanor charge
of assault in the third degree,

40:04.069 --> 40:07.072
how do you find?

40:07.105 --> 40:09.107
We find the defendant guilty.

40:09.140 --> 40:13.645
On the felony charge of
an unjustified abortional act,

40:13.679 --> 40:14.480
how do you find?

40:14.513 --> 40:17.716
We find the defendant
not guilty.

40:17.749 --> 40:19.851
Court is adjourned.

40:19.885 --> 40:20.919
[gavel knocks]

40:32.230 --> 40:34.666
You okay?

40:34.700 --> 40:36.835
Casey.

40:36.868 --> 40:38.804
So you handed the case

40:38.837 --> 40:40.506
to the defense?

40:40.539 --> 40:43.709
Wayne still got probation.

40:43.742 --> 40:45.777
Really?

40:45.811 --> 40:50.048
Well, I may be pro-life,
but I'm even more pro-law.

40:50.081 --> 40:52.684
Arrest that doctor.

40:57.122 --> 40:59.157
You can't go in there.

41:04.530 --> 41:05.564
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

41:05.597 --> 41:06.565
Arresting you.

41:06.598 --> 41:07.566
What for?

41:07.599 --> 41:08.900
Fraud,
forging medical records,

41:08.934 --> 41:10.068
reckless endangerment.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.837
Well, I've done nothing wrong.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.939
You have the right
to remain silent.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.574
I'm saving innocent lives.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.242
Anything you say can
and will be used--

41:17.275 --> 41:17.342
I'm saving innocent lives.
Against you
in a court of law.
