(mellow music playing)

01:04.867 --> 01:07.633
Dorothy, do we know anybody
named Cecilia?

01:08.333 --> 01:11.667
Your cousin, Ma.
She only has weeks to live.

01:11.734 --> 01:15.333
Oh.
Next time I'll accept the charges.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.767
(telephone rings)

01:22.400 --> 01:23.533
Hello.

01:23.600 --> 01:28.100
No. We don't have a car for sale.
You must have the wrong number.

01:28.166 --> 01:32.233
-Is it a man or a woman?
-It's a woman interested in a Mercedes.

01:32.600 --> 01:34.800
Sorry. The car's been sold.

01:36.900 --> 01:39.166
Blanche, what is this all about?

01:39.233 --> 01:42.233
I've figured out a wonderful way
to meet men.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.266
Rich, eligible men.

01:47.333 --> 01:52.300
I put an ad in the paper saying
I'm selling a Mercedes for a low price.

01:52.367 --> 01:54.166
You don't have a Mercedes.

01:54.233 --> 01:56.967
I'm renting one
and pretending it's for sale.

01:57.033 --> 02:00.500
All day tomorrow,
men will be coming for a test drive.

02:02.467 --> 02:04.600
You can tell a lot about a man
by the way he drives.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.066
That's true.

02:06.367 --> 02:09.233
Sometimes Stan couldn't even get the key
in the ignition.

02:14.166 --> 02:15.633
Hi.
Hi, everybody.

02:15.700 --> 02:19.233
-Miles, how was your evening?
-Terrific, Dorothy.

02:19.300 --> 02:21.567
We saw a marvelous production
of <i>The Glass Menagerie.</i>

02:21.633 --> 02:25.734
-That's one of my favorite plays.
-Frankly, I was disappointed.

02:25.800 --> 02:28.567
-Really?
-When you said we were going

02:28.633 --> 02:33.133
to a revival of Tennessee Williams,
I expected something like a séance.

02:35.200 --> 02:40.200
-Rose, I have never met anyone like you.
-Check the corn field on <i>Hee Haw.</i>

02:45.166 --> 02:49.133
Ma, why don't we go
so that Rose and Miles can be alone?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.567
Why? We were here first.

02:52.367 --> 02:54.100
Isn't it time for your medication?

02:54.467 --> 02:57.467
Oh, good. I thought my buzz
was wearing off.

02:59.633 --> 03:02.533
Oh, I really did have fun tonight.

03:02.900 --> 03:06.767
Remember, I'm taking you out tomorrow
for your birthday, my treat.

03:06.834 --> 03:12.800
Oh, I forgot to tell you. My daughter
Caroline is flying in tomorrow.

03:12.867 --> 03:17.400
Maybe we could all have lunch.
I'm very anxious for you two to meet.

03:17.900 --> 03:21.967
Why don't you two come here for lunch?
I'll cook something special.

03:22.033 --> 03:25.533
That's a great idea.
I love what you made the last time.

03:26.133 --> 03:28.734
What was it called, Gerkenflunken?

03:30.367 --> 03:31.900
Oh, no. That was my uncle...

03:34.033 --> 03:37.033
the owner of St. Olaf's most
famous haberdashery.

03:37.100 --> 03:38.834
He came up with the slogan,

03:38.900 --> 03:41.467
"You don't have to be Amish
to look Amish."

03:45.133 --> 03:50.767
(serene music playing)

03:54.467 --> 03:56.734
Gosh, I wish I could afford
something this pretty

03:56.800 --> 03:58.533
for my potential car buyers,

03:58.600 --> 04:02.066
but I'm having end-of-the-month
money problems.

04:02.133 --> 04:03.800
Looking for a loan?

04:09.000 --> 04:10.667
You've come to the right place.

04:12.367 --> 04:17.800
Why, Sophia, how did you get your hands
on that kind of money?

04:17.867 --> 04:19.934
I'm a grave robber. What's it to you?

04:22.700 --> 04:25.033
Morning, Blanche. Morning, Ma.
You sleep well?

04:25.100 --> 04:29.800
No. I had that recurring nightmare
where I'm in bed with Warren Beatty

04:29.867 --> 04:32.667
and he says, "Sorry.
This is too sick even for me."

04:36.433 --> 04:39.467
Do we have the ingredients
for kerfleugenblugen?

04:40.700 --> 04:42.734
Come on, Rose. Get with it.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.200
Do what the rest of us do,
buy frozen kerfleugenblugen.

04:48.500 --> 04:52.667
Oh, I could never serve store-bought
candied herring.

04:53.100 --> 04:57.900
Besides, I have my own special recipe.
I use red hots for the eyes.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.567
Kill her. Kill her now.

05:03.200 --> 05:05.767
-(telephone rings)
-I'll get it.

05:07.900 --> 05:09.233
Hello?

05:09.300 --> 05:14.200
You are aware it's a two-seater.
It's not a family car.

05:15.500 --> 05:16.567
Oh?

05:18.166 --> 05:21.400
How long have you
and your wife been separated?

05:23.867 --> 05:28.200
You might as well come over for a look.
How about 12:20?

05:29.033 --> 05:30.266
Oh, good.

05:30.967 --> 05:33.934
I can't wait for you
to get your hands on it either.

05:34.834 --> 05:35.834
Bye.

05:37.133 --> 05:39.100
You're not having company, are you?

05:39.166 --> 05:42.400
I want everything to go smoothly
for Miles and Caroline.

05:42.467 --> 05:44.867
It's a big step, meeting a man's family.

05:44.934 --> 05:47.800
Don't worry. Men will be
in and out all day.

05:47.867 --> 05:49.133
Don't say it, Ma.

05:53.166 --> 05:54.133
I have to.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.567
At my age it can back up
and come out some other way.

06:00.233 --> 06:04.900
(calm music playing)

06:08.667 --> 06:11.900
My first appointment's here
right on time.

06:11.967 --> 06:15.767
I've been out there watching him.
He's been looking at the car and smiling.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.667
I feel like a fisherman with a new lure.

06:22.033 --> 06:23.934
You catch him, you clean him.

06:26.967 --> 06:31.333
Blanche, aren't you embarrassed using
all this subterfuge just to get a man?

06:31.400 --> 06:32.567
A man?

06:32.633 --> 06:35.433
I'm planning on getting
a six-month supply.

06:36.934 --> 06:38.800
(doorbell rings)

06:40.900 --> 06:44.533
Oh, hi. Blanche?
James. I'm here about the car.

06:44.600 --> 06:47.133
-Miles?
-No, honey. It's James.

06:47.200 --> 06:49.266
I'll get the keys.

06:50.667 --> 06:52.934
How much mileage has she got on her?

07:02.233 --> 07:04.834
Let's just say she's been
around the block.

07:08.166 --> 07:11.900
Here we go, James.
Let's put the pedal to the metal.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.600
I can't believe anything that beautiful
is so cheap.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.500
I'm cramping up.

07:29.033 --> 07:32.500
-Miles?
-No. We'll tell you when he gets here.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.433
Maybe we need a signal.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.467
How about this?
I yell, "Hey, Rose, Miles is here."

07:39.533 --> 07:40.600
Got it.

07:41.633 --> 07:44.266
-(doorbell rings)
-Miles?

07:44.333 --> 07:45.767
Rose!

07:46.400 --> 07:49.967
Well, you might have forgotten the signal.
I know I did.

07:51.200 --> 07:54.133
Hi. Delivery for a Sophia Petrillo.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.266
Here's a president you've never seen.

08:00.533 --> 08:03.734
Look what I got, Dorothy,
a surprise for you.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.500
Oh.

08:07.700 --> 08:11.867
Oh. Oh, look at these watches.

08:11.934 --> 08:14.467
-They must have cost you a fortune.
-They did.

08:15.166 --> 08:16.567
Where'd you get the money?

08:16.633 --> 08:19.233
Is that what you say when you
receive a gift?

08:19.300 --> 08:21.333
I asked you a question.

08:21.400 --> 08:25.133
I never told you this,
but I'm a special friend of Phil Rizzuto.

08:25.767 --> 08:27.200
(doorbell rings)

08:31.834 --> 08:33.700
-Hi, ladies.
-Hello, Miles.

08:33.767 --> 08:38.500
-This is my daughter Caroline.
-So nice to meet you.

08:38.567 --> 08:41.600
-This is Sophia.
-Rose, Miles is here.

08:46.000 --> 08:49.333
-Rose, Miles is here!
-Who?

08:51.767 --> 08:54.967
-Hello, Rose!
-Miles?

08:55.033 --> 08:58.533
Rose, this is Caroline.
Caroline, Rose Nylund.

08:59.300 --> 09:02.834
-How do you do?
-I'm so glad to finally meet you.

09:03.166 --> 09:07.467
Lunch is ready on the lanai.
Miles tells me you're a musician.

09:07.533 --> 09:09.400
-What do you play?
-The English horn.

09:09.467 --> 09:12.533
I didn't know horns had nationalities.

09:13.900 --> 09:17.066
Well, I guess it makes sense
if jumping beans can be Mexican

09:17.133 --> 09:22.800
and fire drills can be Chinese
and flies can be Spanish.

09:28.934 --> 09:31.033
(doorbell rings)

09:32.400 --> 09:35.133
-I'm here about the car.
-Come in. Have a seat.

09:35.500 --> 09:38.233
-How are you doing?
-Blanche will be here soon.

09:38.300 --> 09:41.967
-She's out on a test drive.
-Blanche said I'd be the first.

09:42.033 --> 09:44.533
She's been using that line for 40 years.

09:49.633 --> 09:53.967
That was fun, James.
We ought to get together again sometime.

09:54.033 --> 09:56.233
I'd like to discuss buying the car.

09:56.300 --> 09:59.900
Later. I'll get backed up on
my appointments. Are you Thomas?

09:59.967 --> 10:03.600
-I sure am.
-Don't show him the car.

10:03.667 --> 10:08.033
-I'll write a check now.
-I want the car. Take my check.

10:08.100 --> 10:13.600
-I'm making a $5,000 deposit.
-I can't do that. The banks are closed.

10:13.667 --> 10:16.567
-I can't be sure it's good.
-You've got an honest face.

10:16.633 --> 10:18.433
I'll cash that check right here.

10:23.500 --> 10:27.433
-Ma, can I see you in the kitchen?
-I've got no secrets from them.

10:27.500 --> 10:29.834
-Shady Pines, Ma.
-Right behind you.

10:30.367 --> 10:33.166
Look, I think you should take my check.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.400
Tell me where you got the money.

10:36.467 --> 10:38.767
The government
is being kinder and gentler

10:38.834 --> 10:41.767
by sending me a lot more
social security checks.

10:43.166 --> 10:47.367
The computer made a mistake.
That money doesn't belong to you.

10:47.433 --> 10:48.967
How much are we talking about?

10:49.033 --> 10:52.033
Enough to have you rubbed out
if you rat on me.

10:54.300 --> 10:57.667
So far, 170 grand,
but I haven't checked today's mail.

11:00.900 --> 11:05.967
It was sweet of you to go to all this
trouble. This is, uh... delicious.

11:06.033 --> 11:09.266
Mmm, even the eyes.
Have you tried those eyes?

11:13.133 --> 11:17.400
Oh, no, you ate the tail
before you had a chance to make a wish.

11:17.467 --> 11:19.266
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:19.333 --> 11:22.200
I couldn't help myself.
It was all so delicious.

11:22.266 --> 11:24.367
You certainly know
the way to a man's heart.

11:25.367 --> 11:28.100
-I'll just take these in.
-I'll help.

11:28.166 --> 11:30.900
-Who wants birthday cake?
-What's in it?

11:30.967 --> 11:32.166
It's a secret.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.500
And in some countries a vaccine.

11:39.767 --> 11:45.033
Listen, I'll give you $20,000
and free root canal work.

11:47.467 --> 11:51.533
-You're a dentist.
-I tell you what, I'll give you $25,000

11:51.600 --> 11:54.166
-and free root canal work.
-You're a dentist, too.

11:54.233 --> 11:55.900
No, but I really want this car.

11:59.133 --> 12:00.433
Mail call!

12:01.333 --> 12:06.233
Me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me. See ya.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.200
Ma, these are all checks
from the government?

12:09.266 --> 12:11.734
There's also an application for a gold
card.

12:11.800 --> 12:13.667
Boy, word gets around fast.

12:15.367 --> 12:20.333
-See, anyway...
-I'm so happy I finally got to meet you.

12:20.400 --> 12:24.600
-I'm happy, too. Rose--
-I think we'll be good friends.

12:25.166 --> 12:28.667
There's something we need to discuss
about you and daddy.

12:28.734 --> 12:31.533
I know it seems like a crazy match--

12:31.600 --> 12:34.467
a college professor
and a farmer's daughter...

12:34.834 --> 12:38.166
but somehow what we have together
seems to work.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.600
Rose, it's only been a year
since my mother died.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.300
Daddy's still very vulnerable right now.

12:45.367 --> 12:49.734
I understand why he reached out for you.
You're very warm and giving...

12:50.633 --> 12:51.900
but he needs time.

12:52.600 --> 12:55.400
So, please, if you really
care for my father,

12:55.467 --> 12:58.000
the best thing to do
is stay away from him.

12:59.333 --> 13:05.033
(calm music playing)

13:10.367 --> 13:14.166
My God, Rose, now I've got three
excited men out there.

13:14.233 --> 13:16.967
For the first time in my life,
it's too many.

13:18.900 --> 13:22.433
Blanche, your 1:30 appointment's here,
and I think he's interested.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.800
Not another one. What am I going to do?

13:24.867 --> 13:29.467
Blanche, didn't you think
these men would want to buy the car?

13:29.533 --> 13:33.567
No. I assumed once they saw me,
they'd forget all about the car.

13:35.633 --> 13:39.266
I've got to do something
to get their minds off that car.

13:39.333 --> 13:43.166
-I know what. I'll offer them some cake.
-That's Miles' birthday cake.

13:43.233 --> 13:46.166
-He'll have other birthdays.
-But not with me.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.667
What's wrong?

13:48.867 --> 13:52.633
Caroline told me to stay away from Miles
'cause it's only been a year

13:52.700 --> 13:56.433
-since his wife died.
-That's terrible.

13:56.500 --> 13:58.000
Don't give her any cake.

13:59.934 --> 14:03.133
Rose, those are Caroline's feelings,
not Miles'.

14:03.200 --> 14:07.100
-Otherwise, why would he be here?
-I was trying so hard to impress her.

14:07.567 --> 14:11.900
I remember when we had to impress
a man's parents, not his children.

14:11.967 --> 14:16.300
Mother Devereaux was dead set
against me marrying George.

14:16.367 --> 14:18.734
She wanted her little boy
to marry a virgin.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.200
How did she know you weren't?

14:25.266 --> 14:28.567
Maybe it was all those "Honk if you've had
Blanche" bumper stickers.

14:29.533 --> 14:30.867
Oh.

14:36.934 --> 14:41.400
-I don't know what to do.
-I could settle that in one minute.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.834
I can handle men one at a time.

14:43.900 --> 14:45.633
Could you really do something?

14:45.700 --> 14:50.100
Sure, if Dorothy will handle that mess
in the living room.

14:50.166 --> 14:53.233
Just a minute. I have my own problems.

14:53.300 --> 14:56.900
I'm dealing with a mother
who stole money from the government.

14:57.734 --> 15:00.367
Come on. It's not like
I'm an elected official.

15:04.800 --> 15:08.967
Turn her in,
but first take care of those men.

15:09.033 --> 15:13.567
-I have to take care of my mother.
-I can't handle both Miles and the men.

15:13.633 --> 15:16.233
Please do this for me.

15:16.300 --> 15:19.533
-Oh, all right.
-I don't want my plan ruined.

15:19.600 --> 15:23.100
I still intend to date James and Thomas.
Let them down easy.

15:23.500 --> 15:25.633
Frank and Eddie, flush 'em.

15:29.333 --> 15:31.867
Oh, Rose, don't be so upset.

15:31.934 --> 15:35.967
You've seen the way Miles looks
when you tell St. Olaf stories.

15:36.033 --> 15:38.600
-He looks like he's listening.
-There you go.

15:41.834 --> 15:47.066
Oh, excuse me. Excuse me.
Did you see a little old lady go by?

15:47.133 --> 15:50.734
The one who said,
"I can buy you and sell you"? That way.

15:58.967 --> 16:00.367
-(knock on door)
-Ma?

16:02.300 --> 16:05.633
Now look, Ma,
we have to talk about the money.

16:05.700 --> 16:10.000
Don't worry. Your sister and brother
don't have to know anything about this.

16:10.500 --> 16:14.433
Promise that you'll send this money
back to the government.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.867
They're not good with money.
They can't handle it.

16:16.934 --> 16:19.200
They spent $400 for a toilet seat.

16:21.166 --> 16:23.100
I'm really surprised at you.

16:23.567 --> 16:27.433
When I was little, you told me how much
it meant to you

16:27.500 --> 16:30.066
when you first came to America.

16:30.133 --> 16:34.500
Remember what you thought of
when you first saw the Statue of Liberty

16:34.567 --> 16:37.200
holding up her torch of freedom?

16:37.266 --> 16:39.467
-I was amazed...
-You see?

16:39.533 --> 16:42.667
I was amazed that women in this country
shaved under their arms.

16:44.166 --> 16:47.433
Ma, you told me
how much America meant to you,

16:47.500 --> 16:49.400
how wonderful America was,

16:49.467 --> 16:54.200
how nice it is to be in a country
that doesn't care about soccer.

16:55.967 --> 16:58.233
That money belongs to America.

16:58.300 --> 17:01.533
Ma, you have America's money,
and you have to give it back.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.900
-Dorothy, ple--
-You taught me to love America.

17:05.533 --> 17:10.934
You were the first one to make me feel
proud of being an American.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.834
You were the first one
who put an American flag in my hand.

17:15.467 --> 17:21.233
Why don't you take a moment
and think what America has given you?

17:21.300 --> 17:23.300
Besides this 170 grand?

17:23.900 --> 17:26.834
All right. I'll send it back.

17:27.433 --> 17:30.100
-All of it?
-Yes, all of it.

17:30.166 --> 17:34.867
Ok, ok. I just hope they want it back
after an 83-year-old woman

17:34.934 --> 17:36.700
rolled around in it naked.

17:45.533 --> 17:49.834
-Well, how was lunch?
-Blanche, how does Rose do it?

17:49.900 --> 17:53.767
The herring was not only delicious,
but it looked happy.

17:56.233 --> 18:01.266
Well, Caroline, did you tell your daddy
about your little talk with Rose?

18:02.800 --> 18:05.133
-Not yet.
-Oh? What did I miss?

18:05.200 --> 18:11.567
-I think he has a right to know.
-I told Rose the truth, daddy.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.166
It's too soon for you
to have a relationship.

18:14.233 --> 18:17.033
-You what?
-Wait. Could I say something?

18:17.100 --> 18:21.667
You think your daddy's become involved
too soon after your mother's demise,

18:21.734 --> 18:24.367
but, honey, a year is more than
respectable.

18:24.867 --> 18:28.667
Men have called me
when their wives were in intensive care.

18:38.834 --> 18:42.367
Granted, these men were not pillars
of the community.

18:43.467 --> 18:46.066
-Well, he is not ready.
-Caroline!

18:47.333 --> 18:50.133
Your mother and I
were married for 43 years.

18:50.200 --> 18:51.734
They were wonderful years.

18:52.667 --> 18:55.767
I didn't think I could possibly
find someone I'd care about again.

18:55.834 --> 18:59.000
This happens when it happens.
I've got a second chance.

19:00.066 --> 19:02.300
It would be nice
if you'd be happy for me.

19:05.600 --> 19:09.400
-How could he do this?
-He has needs.

19:09.467 --> 19:11.333
All men do.

19:12.400 --> 19:15.700
And there are women out there
willing to stoop to any means

19:15.767 --> 19:17.367
to prey on those needs.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.300
Including false advertising.

19:21.233 --> 19:23.100
I know. I've met them.

19:24.567 --> 19:28.133
Just thank your lucky stars
Rose Nylund is not one of those.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.266
I never looked at it that way.

19:30.333 --> 19:33.100
Besides, after you get to know Rose,
you'll...

19:36.700 --> 19:37.967
you'll...

19:38.700 --> 19:41.233
oh, why spoil the surprise?

19:42.500 --> 19:45.767
-This is not fair.
-Gentlemen! Gentlemen, please!

19:45.834 --> 19:50.333
You don't seem to understand.
The car is not for sale.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.533
-Why not?
-It's... haunted.

19:54.867 --> 19:58.266
-What?
-It's haunted. I know. I rode in it.

19:58.867 --> 20:01.367
-You look ok.
-I'm 27 years old.

20:06.266 --> 20:10.600
We're not getting anywhere.
Blanche wants James and Thomas.

20:10.667 --> 20:15.100
I'll try to save them. You go with frick
and frack and try to ditch them.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.667
-You want me to offend them?
-Pretend they're family.

20:20.834 --> 20:25.033
Uh, look, everybody named
after an apostle, come with me.

20:27.367 --> 20:29.433
Excuse me. There was no Eddie.

20:32.000 --> 20:34.567
Uh, have you guys ever heard
of <i>Totally Hidden Video?</i>

20:35.266 --> 20:38.266
Underneath this gray wig
is comedienne Kaye Ballard.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.233
Thanks for being on our show.

20:43.433 --> 20:48.600
So that's the story. The car is not
available, but Blanche Devereaux is.

20:48.667 --> 20:50.433
I can't believe that I've been hustled.

20:51.233 --> 20:55.066
If I wasn't a teacher
and accustomed to abuse, I'd leave, too.

20:57.367 --> 21:01.000
-Really? You know, I'm a teacher myself.
-No kidding.

21:02.600 --> 21:06.567
Say, um, why don't you tell me
about this automobile thing again,

21:06.633 --> 21:09.166
say, uh... tonight over dinner?

21:09.233 --> 21:13.600
Blanche Devereaux is a very charming,
attractive woman.

21:13.667 --> 21:17.200
-Yes. Shall I pick you up around 7:30?
-I feel terrible about this.

21:17.266 --> 21:18.400
Let's say 8:00.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.433
-Here.
-Hmm?

21:23.500 --> 21:25.066
Take her someplace decent.

21:31.166 --> 21:35.133
Look, Rose, I told Caroline
how I feel about you.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.667
Maybe Caroline is right.

21:37.166 --> 21:39.600
Your wife died such
a little while ago.

21:39.667 --> 21:42.934
Maybe I am taking
advantage of your vulnerability.

21:43.000 --> 21:46.900
-Rose, you're a smart woman.
-Oh, you are vulnerable.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.800
Of course, I am.
I'm drawn to your beauty, your charm,

21:51.867 --> 21:53.700
your own unique brand of wisdom.

21:54.734 --> 21:58.333
-But what about Caroline?
-Oh, Caroline doesn't know everything.

21:59.166 --> 22:01.367
You should see the cardigan
she got for my birthday.

22:01.433 --> 22:04.400
She can't pick a sweater,
much less a person.

22:04.467 --> 22:08.667
-I wish she felt better about us.
-She'll just have to get used to us.

22:09.367 --> 22:10.533
I'm staying around...

22:11.400 --> 22:12.633
if you'll let me.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.667
Oh, I'll let you.

22:17.400 --> 22:20.166
-Rose.
-Not in the kitchen.

22:20.233 --> 22:22.000
You'll dry out the cheese.

22:25.333 --> 22:28.867
-I'll see you tonight, Rose.
-Bye-bye, Miles.

22:28.934 --> 22:30.066
You take care of her.

22:32.166 --> 22:35.333
-Blanche, I can't thank you enough.
-You're welcome.

22:35.400 --> 22:38.567
-Let's get to the important stuff.
-Who am I going out with tonight?

22:38.633 --> 22:42.734
Well, uh, James says
he never wants to see you again,

22:42.800 --> 22:47.333
and the truth is,
I'm going out with Thomas tonight.

22:47.867 --> 22:52.166
-You're not upset, are you, Blanche?
-Well, no, I'm not upset.

22:52.233 --> 22:53.700
It serves me right.

22:53.767 --> 22:58.300
Matter of fact, take the Mercedes.
Yeah. Have a good time.

22:58.367 --> 23:01.367
Oh, Blanche, that's awfully
sweet of you.

23:01.433 --> 23:02.734
You got this coming.

23:10.934 --> 23:11.934
Hello.

23:12.000 --> 23:14.433
I would like to report a stolen Mercedes.

23:18.266 --> 23:19.433
Hmm?

23:24.000 --> 23:29.934
(theme music playing)
