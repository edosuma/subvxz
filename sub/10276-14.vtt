Okay, okay, I'm hurrying

01:05.666 --> 01:08.767
You really should give me
more warning about these things.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.776
<i> A Tale of Miss Nettle.</i>

01:17.778 --> 01:19.211
A book about Miss Nettle?

01:19.213 --> 01:21.613
Oh, no, what is she
up to now?

01:29.756 --> 01:33.125
BOOK VOICE:
<i> There is a far-off land</i>
<i> so cold and wintry</i>

01:33.127 --> 01:35.127
<i> that the ground</i>
<i> is always covered</i>

01:35.129 --> 01:37.396
<i> in a thick blanket</i>
<i> of snow.</i>

01:37.398 --> 01:39.798
<i> The kingdom of</i>
<i> Freezenberg.</i>

01:39.800 --> 01:41.433
That's where
Hildegard lives.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.769
<i> For many years,</i>
<i> not a single flower</i>

01:43.771 --> 01:46.705
<i> grew in Freezenberg,</i>
<i> not one lily or rosebud</i>

01:46.707 --> 01:48.907
<i> to brighten people's day.</i>

01:48.909 --> 01:51.410
<i> The king sent his gardener</i>
<i> on a quest</i>

01:51.412 --> 01:55.314
<i> to find a flower that could</i>
<i> grow in Freezenberg.</i>

01:55.316 --> 01:58.617
<i> And the gardener returned</i>
<i> with something remarkable.</i>

01:58.619 --> 02:02.054
<i> A flower strong enough to</i>
<i>pierce through snow and ice--</i>

02:02.056 --> 02:04.623
<i> the beautiful snowdrop.</i>

02:04.625 --> 02:07.426
<i> The people loved</i>
<i> their new flower,</i>

02:07.428 --> 02:09.628
<i> and planted it</i>
<i> all over the kingdom.</i>

02:09.630 --> 02:12.664
<i> They began to celebrate</i>
<i> the snowdrop each year</i>

02:12.666 --> 02:14.833
<i> with a winter flower</i>
<i> festival.</i>

02:14.835 --> 02:17.603
<i> In fact, the festival</i>
<i> is supposed to take place</i>

02:17.605 --> 02:18.770
<i> on this very night.</i>

02:18.772 --> 02:21.507
<i> But there is</i>
<i> one problem.</i>

02:21.509 --> 02:23.809
This is probably
where Miss Nettle comes in.

02:23.811 --> 02:26.745
<i> A wicked fairy,</i>
<i> Miss Nettle,</i>

02:26.747 --> 02:29.648
<i> has been stealing</i>
<i> all the snowdrops.</i>

02:29.650 --> 02:32.451
<i> If Miss Nettle succeeds</i>
<i> in taking them all,</i>

02:32.453 --> 02:35.287
<i> there will be</i>
<i> no winter festival,</i>

02:35.289 --> 02:37.422
<i> and what's worse,</i>
<i> the people of Freezenberg</i>

02:37.424 --> 02:41.793
<i>will no longer have a single</i>
<i> flower in their kingdom.</i>

02:41.795 --> 02:43.795
Oh, no!
I've got to stop Miss Nettle,

02:43.797 --> 02:46.098
and give this story
a happy ending.

02:46.100 --> 02:48.834
( neighing )

02:50.036 --> 02:52.037
Do you see Miss Nettle
anywhere?

02:52.039 --> 02:55.274
No, but that could be
because I can't stop shivering.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.676
Oh, and I don't know
what she looks like.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.278
There she is.

02:59.280 --> 03:02.614
One flower for me,
and one flower for me,

03:02.616 --> 03:04.850
and another for me,
and who am I kidding?

03:04.852 --> 03:07.819
They're all for me.
( laughing )

03:07.821 --> 03:10.622
- We have to stop her.
- All by ourselves?

03:10.624 --> 03:13.358
But she has magic,
and a really scary laugh.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.362
Don't worry.
We have magic, too.

03:17.364 --> 03:19.231
Hey there.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.166
Do you guys think
you could help me out?

03:21.168 --> 03:23.235
Does everyone
understand the plan?

03:23.237 --> 03:26.238
Yep. We'll distract
the hoo-orrible fairy.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.839
As soon as
you give the signal.

03:27.841 --> 03:30.042
Good. That will give
me and Minimus

03:30.044 --> 03:32.878
a chance to swoop in close
and grab the stolen snowdrops.

03:32.880 --> 03:36.748
- Right. Wait.
How close?
- Everyone ready?

03:38.918 --> 03:41.153
Let's go!

03:44.924 --> 03:47.826
Get your feathers
out of my face!

03:50.029 --> 03:53.899
Oh! Get away from me,
you filthy beasts.

03:53.901 --> 03:56.235
What is this?
I'm warning you.

03:56.237 --> 03:58.537
What in the world
is going on?

03:58.539 --> 04:00.172
Go, Minimus!

04:00.174 --> 04:03.709
Hold it right there,
Miss Nettle!

04:11.417 --> 04:13.352
Well, well, well.

04:13.354 --> 04:15.354
If it isn't
my least favorite

04:15.356 --> 04:17.389
meddling princess.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.792
Why must you always
get in my way?

04:20.794 --> 04:23.128
And why do you have to cause
so many problems?

04:23.130 --> 04:24.863
I do no such thing.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.132
I'm simply taking
what's mine.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.368
These flowers
aren't yours.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.903
They belong to
the people of Freezenberg.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.605
That's what you think.

04:33.607 --> 04:35.774
They're mine,
and they always have been.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.778
- Ha ha!
- I'll find a way
to get them back.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.815
Not after you have a dose
of my crazy crystals.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.656
Did anyone see
where she went?

04:50.658 --> 04:53.425
- Hoo.
- Um... what did you say?

04:53.427 --> 04:55.894
- ( hooting )
- ( roaring )

04:55.896 --> 04:57.396
Why aren't they
talking to me?

04:57.398 --> 04:59.298
( whinnies )

04:59.300 --> 05:02.000
Oh, Minimus,
I can't understand you.

05:02.002 --> 05:04.903
( whinnies )

05:04.905 --> 05:07.072
My amulet isn't working.

05:07.074 --> 05:10.008
It must be Miss Nettle's
crazy crystals.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.444
I remember when she put them
on Mr. Cedric's wand,

05:12.446 --> 05:14.680
- and messed up his magic.
- ( whinnies )

05:14.682 --> 05:17.516
Oh, I can't understand
any of you.

05:17.518 --> 05:19.084
But if you
can understand me,

05:19.086 --> 05:21.820
please, please go
and find Miss Nettle.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.722
We have to stop her.

05:27.827 --> 05:30.429
Even if they find her,
how will they tell me
where she is?

05:30.431 --> 05:32.931
( whinnies )

05:32.933 --> 05:36.868
Oh, Minimus, I'm not sure
I can do this without
my amulet, without you.

05:38.438 --> 05:40.672
Look. Maybe a princess
is coming to help.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.712
What ya lookin' for?

05:46.714 --> 05:48.213
( startled yell )

05:48.215 --> 05:49.948
Oh, sorry.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.817
No, my bad.
That's okay.

05:51.819 --> 05:54.019
You'd be surprised
how often this happens to me.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.521
I'm over here.

05:56.523 --> 05:58.323
Getting colder.

05:58.325 --> 06:00.892
Here. Let me help.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.129
Ah, thanks.

06:04.131 --> 06:07.899
I'm Olaf, and I like
warm hugs.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.168
Oh! I'm Sofia.

06:10.170 --> 06:12.804
And this is Minimus.

06:12.806 --> 06:16.808
Whoo! He's like a purple
reindeer with wings
and no antlers.

06:16.810 --> 06:18.343
( indignant whinny )

06:18.345 --> 06:21.079
So what are you
looking for, Sofia?

06:21.081 --> 06:22.547
A princess.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.149
Oh, I was just
with a princess.

06:24.151 --> 06:26.151
Princess Anna
of Arendelle.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.153
I'm not sure where
she went though.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.355
Or where I am.
Where am I?

06:30.357 --> 06:33.692
- Oh, no.
- Ohno, Ohno.

06:33.694 --> 06:35.494
Nope, never heard of it.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.095
Is it far from
Arendelle,

06:37.097 --> 06:38.897
because I should
probably get back.

06:38.899 --> 06:42.067
Olaf, I think my amulet
brought you here by mistake.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.102
It usually brings
a princess to give advice.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.671
But a wicked fairy
blew crazy crystals on it,

06:46.673 --> 06:49.674
and, well,
it sent you instead.

06:49.676 --> 06:52.110
( laughs ) The amulet
sent me to give advice?

06:52.112 --> 06:53.879
I can give you advice.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.614
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.951
( whispers )Don't get
too close to fire.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.320
Oh, okay. Thanks.

07:03.523 --> 07:05.223
So... what now?

07:05.225 --> 07:08.960
Well, usually,
princesses go back
where they came from.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.029
Oh, right.
Well, bye then.

07:11.031 --> 07:14.032
Good luck with
the wicked fairy.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.434
Okay, it was nice
meeting you.

07:20.206 --> 07:23.608
Uh... I'm still here.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.977
It's because my amulet's
not working right.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.146
I'm so sorry,

07:28.148 --> 07:29.414
but I'm afraid
you may be stuck here.

07:29.416 --> 07:31.116
As in forever,

07:31.118 --> 07:33.752
or some other
less forever-y amount of time?

07:33.754 --> 07:35.253
I don't know.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.122
This is getting
worse and worse.

07:37.124 --> 07:39.157
Now we need to stop
Miss Nettle

07:39.159 --> 07:40.992
from ruining the flower festival
and fix my amulet

07:40.994 --> 07:42.427
so you can go home.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.930
Aw, it's okay, Sofia.

07:44.932 --> 07:47.299
Me and the purple
antler-less reindeer

07:47.301 --> 07:49.067
can help you out.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.302
Okay.

07:50.304 --> 07:52.103
All right, what do
we do first?

07:52.105 --> 07:54.139
I guess we have to find
Miss Nettle.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.774
Okay, let's do it.

07:55.776 --> 07:57.809
Oh, sorry.

07:59.579 --> 08:02.414
Whoo! Nice ride.
It's like a one-horse
open sleigh.

08:02.416 --> 08:04.282
( angry snort )

08:04.284 --> 08:06.318
Let's cover as much ground
as possible.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.486
Yah, Minimus!

08:07.488 --> 08:09.754
Whoo!

08:11.090 --> 08:14.125
Now this is
the way to travel.

08:14.127 --> 08:18.296
Oh, I just love feeling
the wind through my sticks.

08:18.298 --> 08:21.466
Everything looks
so small up here.

08:21.468 --> 08:23.201
Oh, look, a carrot.

08:23.203 --> 08:25.203
Oh. Oh, wait.

08:25.205 --> 08:26.872
- Oh, that's my nose!
- Olaf!

08:28.174 --> 08:31.543
I'm okay!!

08:38.651 --> 08:40.218
We have to get him,
Minimus.

08:42.221 --> 08:44.556
Still okay!
Ooh, nice view.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.193
Faster, faster.

08:52.899 --> 08:55.066
- Where did he go?
- BOY: He needs
a scarf.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.202
GIRL: Here, use mine.

08:58.804 --> 09:02.207
Oh, no.
Which snowman is Olaf?

09:02.209 --> 09:05.544
- Hey, that's
my snowman.
- Oh, sorry.

09:07.079 --> 09:08.713
That's not him.

09:08.715 --> 09:11.082
Nope. Not that one.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.251
Not this one either.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.754
MAN: Kids, dinner.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.757
I wanted to put a snowdrop
in my snowman's hair.

09:18.759 --> 09:21.493
Well, we don't have
any snowdrops anymore,

09:21.495 --> 09:24.729
and we're probably not even
going to have the festival.

09:24.731 --> 09:27.766
But that's the most
fun night of
the whole year.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.568
I'll find a flower
for you.

09:29.570 --> 09:30.936
( both scream )

09:30.938 --> 09:32.671
A talking snowman!

09:32.673 --> 09:34.706
Or I could just
stay here if you want.

09:34.708 --> 09:37.275
There's where Olaf.
What were you doing?

09:37.277 --> 09:39.277
Trying to make
some new friends.

09:39.279 --> 09:41.179
But these guys
don't talk much.

09:41.181 --> 09:44.349
- So where to?
- To find Miss Nettle.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.751
But I still have
no idea where she went.

09:46.753 --> 09:49.454
Oh, even if we find
Miss Nettle,

09:49.456 --> 09:52.958
I don't know how I can stop her
without my amulet's magic.

09:52.960 --> 09:56.394
You know, Queen Elsa
has all kinds of magic,

09:56.396 --> 09:57.862
but it still took
Princess Anna

09:57.864 --> 10:00.065
to show her how to
unfreeze Arendelle,

10:00.067 --> 10:02.067
and Anna doesn't have
any powers,

10:02.069 --> 10:04.302
except that she
never gives up,

10:04.304 --> 10:06.771
and she has
a big heart.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.740
Those aren't
magic powers, Olaf.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.375
I know, Sofia.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.077
They're better.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.112
Hmm. Maybe you're right.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.448
I guess I have to try.

10:16.450 --> 10:18.216
That's the spirit.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.385
Now let's go find
that wicked fairy.

10:20.387 --> 10:24.222
Ooh, look,
here comes one now.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.925
No, that's just
my friend Hildegard. Hildy!

10:26.927 --> 10:28.493
Sofia, is that you?

10:28.495 --> 10:31.563
Well, if you came for
the winter flower festival,

10:31.565 --> 10:33.565
I have terrible news.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.433
The snowdrops
are vanishing.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.335
It's okay.
We know who took them.

10:37.337 --> 10:40.238
( gasps ) You have
a talking snowman?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.073
This is
my friend Olaf.

10:42.075 --> 10:44.275
Hi. This is
my friend Sofia.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.845
He's so...
I want one.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.513
Right now.

10:48.515 --> 10:51.149
Are you sure she's not
the wicked fairy?

10:51.151 --> 10:53.084
Hildegard, about
the flowers.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.253
Miss Nettle is the one
taking them.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.856
That evil fairy who caused
all those problems

10:57.858 --> 11:00.091
at Royal Prep?
Why would she do that?

11:00.093 --> 11:02.761
I don't know,
but she's stealing
all of them.

11:02.763 --> 11:04.529
Have you seen her?

11:04.531 --> 11:07.298
No. I've been looking
all over the kingdom
for flowers,

11:07.300 --> 11:08.933
and I haven't seen
anything but snow.

11:08.935 --> 11:12.203
This is just what
Freezenberg used to look like

11:12.205 --> 11:15.974
before that royal gardener
brought us our beautiful
snowdrops.

11:15.976 --> 11:18.043
I can't believe
they're almost gone.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.644
What do you mean
almost?

11:19.646 --> 11:21.212
Well, we still have
a few growing

11:21.214 --> 11:23.948
in the royal gardens
near the castle,

11:23.950 --> 11:26.384
but not enough
for a festival.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.719
Did you hear that?

11:27.721 --> 11:29.387
There are still
flowers left,

11:29.389 --> 11:31.022
and wherever
there are flowers...

11:31.024 --> 11:32.624
There are bees.

11:32.626 --> 11:35.393
No. Wherever there are flowers,
we'll find Miss Nettle.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.295
I'm going back to
the castle.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.030
I've got to tell Daddy
about this.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.165
We'll meet you there.

11:40.167 --> 11:42.300
Yah, Minimus.

11:43.803 --> 11:46.404
This time, you have
to hold on, Olaf.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.139
Oh, trust me, I will.

11:48.141 --> 11:50.041
I told you,
I like warm hugs.

11:51.410 --> 11:54.345
Come with me,
my beautiful flowers.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.548
Mine, all mine.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.484
Dance into my bag,
my fine flowers.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.189
Now I don't like
to label people,

12:04.191 --> 12:05.857
but I believe I see
another wicked fairy.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.325
Miss Nettle.

12:07.327 --> 12:09.828
Ooh, look at
all those pretty flowers.

12:09.830 --> 12:11.496
I need to tell Miss Nettle

12:11.498 --> 12:13.765
how important
these flowers are
to Freezenberg,

12:13.767 --> 12:15.266
and I need
to do it fast.

12:15.268 --> 12:17.402
She's about to take
the very last snowdrop.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.070
I'll stop her.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.773
- Olaf!
- ( yelling )

12:21.775 --> 12:23.908
What is that?

12:30.516 --> 12:32.083
Oh, look at me.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.052
I'm a frozen treat.

12:34.054 --> 12:35.453
Who's up there?

12:35.455 --> 12:37.522
Get off of me!

12:37.524 --> 12:39.357
That doesn't
look right.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.426
Stop right there,
Miss Nettle.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.528
Oh, it's you again.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.563
Actually, I don't believe
we've had the pleasure.

12:45.565 --> 12:47.899
- I'm Olaf.
- Hmm.

12:47.901 --> 12:50.802
Please just listen to me
before you take that
last snowdrop.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.604
Why should I do that?

12:52.606 --> 12:56.040
Because these flowers mean
so much to the people
of Freezenberg.

12:56.042 --> 12:59.043
Well, maybe they mean
a lot to me.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.079
Did you ever think
of that?

13:01.081 --> 13:02.847
No. I didn't.

a flower

14:21.461 --> 14:22.994
that would grow
through the snow.

14:22.996 --> 14:25.396
Oh, he found one,

15:23.790 --> 15:25.290
Yes indeed.

15:25.292 --> 15:27.792
I'm not stealing
anything.

15:27.794 --> 15:30.094
I'm simply taking back
what was mine.

15:30.096 --> 15:31.896
But if you take
all the snowdrops,

15:31.898 --> 15:34.232
there won't be any more
flowers in Freezenberg.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.701
- Too bad for them.
- I can't let you do it.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.804
Well, you have no choice.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.472
No!

15:43.242 --> 15:46.377
Very aggressive vines.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.615
There. Now I've got
every last snowdrop

15:50.617 --> 15:52.884
in the kingdom.

15:52.886 --> 15:54.786
So long, princess.

15:54.788 --> 15:58.456
Tell your Freezenberg friends
to think twice

15:58.458 --> 16:00.658
before they meddle
with Miss Nettle.

16:00.660 --> 16:05.763
Ooh, this bag is really messing
with my dramatic exit.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.465
( straining )

16:07.467 --> 16:11.069
I can't get free.

16:11.071 --> 16:14.072
I thought I could stop her
without the magic powers
from my amulet.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.673
But I can't.

16:15.675 --> 16:17.175
Look on the bright side.

16:17.177 --> 16:19.577
At least that fairy
got her flowers back.

16:19.579 --> 16:21.279
Why is that
the bright side?

16:21.281 --> 16:23.514
Because now maybe
she'll be happy,

16:23.516 --> 16:25.483
like when Elsa saw
how much Anna loved her,

16:25.485 --> 16:28.619
and she started feeling
good inside instead of bad,

16:28.621 --> 16:30.688
and all the ice melted.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.690
It was like summer,

16:32.692 --> 16:35.093
and everyone was happy,

16:35.095 --> 16:37.095
and I almost melted.

16:37.097 --> 16:38.529
You're right, Olaf.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.832
I've been thinking
about this all wrong.

16:40.834 --> 16:44.168
I'm supposed to make sure
this story has a happy ending

16:44.170 --> 16:46.704
for everyone.
including Miss Nettle.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.706
I know what I need to do.

16:48.708 --> 16:51.309
But I can't get out
of these binds.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.510
Don't be sad, Sofia.

16:52.512 --> 16:55.046
You almost made
a happy ending.

16:55.048 --> 16:56.848
I know, but...

16:56.850 --> 16:58.716
Olaf, you're free!

16:58.718 --> 17:00.518
Would you look at that!

17:00.520 --> 17:02.553
Quick, untie us.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.635
King Henrik,
Hildegard.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.137
Sofia, I told you.

17:19.139 --> 17:21.572
We're not having
a festival tonight.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.741
My father was just about
to cancel it.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.743
I don't know why
that evil fairy

17:25.745 --> 17:28.579
stole all our
precious snowdrops.

17:28.581 --> 17:29.981
Her name is Miss Nettle,

17:29.983 --> 17:31.816
and she said that
your royal gardener

17:31.818 --> 17:33.684
stole them from her
years ago

17:33.686 --> 17:35.820
when you sent him to find
a flower for Freezenberg.

17:35.822 --> 17:38.056
It really hurt
Miss Nettle's feelings

17:38.058 --> 17:40.224
that no one ever
thanked her for the flowers.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.560
I'm hoping, well,
if you thank her now,

17:42.562 --> 17:44.562
then maybe
she won't be angry anymore.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.564
Why, of course
I'll thank her.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.533
If she created
the snowdrops,

17:48.535 --> 17:49.600
we certainly owe her
our gratitude.

17:49.602 --> 17:51.335
Show me
where she is.

17:51.337 --> 17:53.938
I'm not sure exactly
where she is.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.174
She flew off as soon as
she got all the snowdrops.

17:56.176 --> 17:59.210
I suppose she has
no reason to come back now.

17:59.212 --> 18:01.179
But she didn't get
all the flowers.

18:01.181 --> 18:03.915
Ah! Did that snowman
just talk?!

18:03.917 --> 18:05.716
This is the one I was
telling you about, Daddy.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.585
Can I have one?

18:07.587 --> 18:10.455
Did you say Miss Nettle
didn't take all the snowdrops?

18:10.457 --> 18:12.557
She missed this one
right here.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.459
I noticed it
a minute ago.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.794
It must've gotten
stuck in my snow
when I rolled down that hill.

18:16.796 --> 18:19.897
Things stick to me a lot
because I'm made of snow.

18:19.899 --> 18:21.732
This is perfect.

18:21.734 --> 18:23.634
We can use this to get
Miss Nettle to come back.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.603
Don't call off the festival
yet, Your Majesty.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.438
Just tell everyone
to gather here,

18:27.440 --> 18:28.773
and wait for me.

18:32.711 --> 18:34.779
Come back,
Miss Nettle.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.315
You left one snowdrop
behind.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.617
- What?!
- You didn't
get them all.

18:39.619 --> 18:44.055
Hand it over this instant,
you rude little princess.

18:53.765 --> 18:55.633
( laughing )

18:55.635 --> 18:58.236
What are those fools doing?

18:58.238 --> 19:01.105
They can't have a festival
without any flowers.

19:01.107 --> 19:03.808
They know that,
but they came here anyway

19:03.810 --> 19:05.643
because the king has
something to say to you.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.779
I understand that you are
the very talented fairy

19:08.781 --> 19:11.282
who created our beloved
snowdrop.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.151
I most certainly was.

19:13.153 --> 19:15.353
Why?

19:15.355 --> 19:17.688
Good people of
Freezenberg,

19:17.690 --> 19:19.924
it was revealed
to me today

19:19.926 --> 19:22.426
that this fine fairy,
Miss Nettle,

19:22.428 --> 19:25.329
is the creator of
the beautiful snowdrop,

19:25.331 --> 19:27.131
the only flower
strong enough

19:27.133 --> 19:30.034
to grow in our fair,
frozen kingdom.

19:30.036 --> 19:31.869
That's my favorite flower!

19:31.871 --> 19:33.771
Oh, well...

19:33.773 --> 19:36.140
It just took
some tinkering

19:36.142 --> 19:38.609
in my enchanted
greenhouse.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.678
Well, it is the most
magnificent flower

19:40.680 --> 19:42.547
I have ever seen.

19:42.549 --> 19:45.516
It's the first flower
every child learns to draw.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.051
It is?

19:47.053 --> 19:48.886
And everyone who
gets married in Freezenberg

19:48.888 --> 19:51.856
does so under
a canopy of snowdrops.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.724
They do?

19:53.726 --> 19:55.993
We all owe you
a great deal of thanks

19:55.995 --> 19:57.695
for giving us
so much joy

19:57.697 --> 19:58.863
for so many years.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.831
On this festive day,

20:00.833 --> 20:03.334
I honor you,
Miss Nettle,

20:03.336 --> 20:07.071
the most remarkable fairy
in all the world!

20:07.073 --> 20:08.439
( applause and cheering )

20:14.880 --> 20:16.547
Thank you.

20:16.549 --> 20:19.750
Thank you
so much.

20:19.752 --> 20:21.352
So, Miss Nettle,

20:21.354 --> 20:22.853
do you think you can
give Freezenberg

20:22.855 --> 20:24.388
back its flowers?

20:24.390 --> 20:28.759
Well, I suppose I could
return some of them.

20:28.761 --> 20:32.363
Uh-uh. We'll only accept
the snowdrops back

20:32.365 --> 20:33.998
on one condition.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.933
Oh? What's that?

20:35.935 --> 20:37.501
That from now on,

20:37.503 --> 20:39.036
instead of calling them
snowdrops,

20:39.038 --> 20:41.038
you let us call them
nettledrops,

20:41.040 --> 20:43.708
so that we may always
remember the kind fairy

20:43.710 --> 20:45.743
who gave them to us.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.279
Nettledrops!

20:48.281 --> 20:50.114
Oh, take them all!

20:50.116 --> 20:51.816
Take them all!

20:57.556 --> 21:01.125
And just to make things
even more fabulous,

21:01.127 --> 21:04.729
decorata floriana!

21:09.968 --> 21:11.969
Thank you.

21:11.971 --> 21:14.572
We've never had
such a marvelous
winter flower festival.

21:14.574 --> 21:15.773
( laughs )

21:15.775 --> 21:18.409
See?
Everyone's happy.

21:18.411 --> 21:19.443
( coughs )

21:19.445 --> 21:21.879
I suppose you are the one

21:21.881 --> 21:24.649
who is responsible
for all this.

21:24.651 --> 21:26.384
Yes, and I'm really glad
you finally got

21:26.386 --> 21:28.219
all the credit
you deserve.

21:28.221 --> 21:30.821
It's about time,
don't you think?

21:30.823 --> 21:33.057
Thank you,

21:33.059 --> 21:35.226
for all that
you did, Sofia.

21:35.228 --> 21:36.827
You're very welcome.

21:36.829 --> 21:39.130
Now maybe there's
something you can
help me with.

21:39.132 --> 21:43.167
( sighs )
All I do is give and give.

21:43.169 --> 21:45.136
Okay, what is it?

21:45.138 --> 21:47.638
Ever since your
crazy crystals
fell on my amulet,

21:47.640 --> 21:49.807
it's been acting funny.

21:49.809 --> 21:52.843
That's what crazy
crystals do.

21:52.845 --> 21:55.646
- Can you fix it?
- Can I fix it?

21:55.648 --> 21:57.515
Haven't you heard?

21:57.517 --> 21:59.984
I'm the most wondrous
fairy in the world!

21:59.986 --> 22:01.819
Of course I can.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.921
Thank you.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.090
Now, I'm going back
to my party,

22:06.092 --> 22:07.825
if you don't mind.
Ta-ta!

22:07.827 --> 22:10.027
Hello, my public!

22:10.029 --> 22:13.130
I am back!
Did you miss me?

22:13.132 --> 22:15.132
Minimus, say something.

22:15.134 --> 22:17.935
I am freezing!

22:17.937 --> 22:20.037
Yes! My amulet's
working again.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.106
I'm so happy.

22:22.108 --> 22:23.708
Oh, I better tell him.

22:23.710 --> 22:27.278
Olaf, my amulet's
fixed.

22:27.280 --> 22:30.014
( gasps )
That's great!

22:30.016 --> 22:32.516
So you'll probably be
able to go home now.

22:32.518 --> 22:35.853
Oh. Oh, I guess
that's great, too.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.855
What's wrong?

22:37.857 --> 22:40.224
Well, I know I was
supposed to come
and give you good advice,

22:40.226 --> 22:43.060
but I didn't really have
any good advice to give.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.663
Olaf, you reminded me
that having a big heart

22:45.665 --> 22:47.965
and never giving up
are more important

22:47.967 --> 22:50.034
than having
magical powers.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.970
That's just about
the best advice
I've ever gotten.

22:52.972 --> 22:55.906
Really? I guess it was
pretty good, wasn't it?

22:55.908 --> 22:57.375
Yes.

22:57.377 --> 23:01.045
And I really meant that
"stay from fire" thing, too.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.981
( giggles )
I will.

23:03.983 --> 23:06.150
Uh, what's happening?

23:06.152 --> 23:09.587
I... I think
you're going back.

23:09.589 --> 23:11.822
I like warm hugs.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.991
That's funny.
So do I.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.060
Bye!

23:16.062 --> 23:19.497
I hope your amulet
breaks again soon

23:19.499 --> 23:23.067
so I can come back
and visit!

23:23.069 --> 23:25.002
Bye, Olaf.

23:25.004 --> 23:27.371
Now for the grand finale.

23:27.373 --> 23:30.441
Florius pluvia!

23:30.443 --> 23:34.779
<i> And that is how</i>
<i> the people of Freezenberg</i>

23:34.781 --> 23:36.947
<i> and Miss Nettle</i>
<i> came to celebrate</i>

23:36.949 --> 23:39.450
<i>their winter flower festival</i>
<i> together,</i>

23:39.452 --> 23:44.121
<i> so that all could enjoy</i>
<i> the beautiful nettledrop.</i>
