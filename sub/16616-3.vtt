00:01.710 --> 00:04.796
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>

00:04.880 --> 00:08.175
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.258 --> 00:11.553
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.929 --> 00:14.139
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.098 --> 00:17.559
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.393 --> 00:21.480
<i>Lucky there's a man who</i>
<i>positively can do</i>

00:21.605 --> 00:23.190
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.357 --> 00:24.691
<i>Laugh and cry</i>

00:24.942 --> 00:29.780
<i>He's a family guy</i>

00:36.495 --> 00:37.788
<i>Good evening, I'm Tom Tucker.</i>

00:37.871 --> 00:39.748
<i>Coming up, why one hello a day</i>

00:39.831 --> 00:42.167
<i>to the receptionist at work</i>
<i>is the magic number.</i>

00:42.376 --> 00:44.711
<i>But first, pilot strike at Quahog Airport.</i>

00:45.087 --> 00:46.672
<i>Picketing began on Thursday...</i>

00:47.047 --> 00:48.340
<i>Weird day to start a strike.</i>

00:48.465 --> 00:50.384
<i>And both sides</i>
<i>appear to be at an impasse.</i>

00:50.634 --> 00:53.762
<i>So, ground control is telling</i>
<i>Major Tom this could be a long one.</i>

00:55.180 --> 00:56.598
<i>Does anyone else like David Bowie?</i>

00:57.641 --> 00:58.851
Hey, what the hell is up with this letter?

00:59.059 --> 01:01.103
It says I'm no longer covered
on your health insurance.

01:01.270 --> 01:02.813
Oh, yeah. They don't cover dogs no more.

01:02.980 --> 01:05.899
You could do COBRA
for $7,300 a month, though.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.568
Would that be something
you'd be interested in?

01:07.651 --> 01:09.862
I need that health insurance.
You know I have a hernia.

01:09.945 --> 01:10.946
What if I need surgery?

01:11.154 --> 01:13.240
Well, if you need insurance that bad,

01:13.323 --> 01:15.868
maybe it's time for you to go out
and get a job of your own.

01:16.326 --> 01:18.912
- Oh, this sucks.
- How did you get a hernia?

01:18.996 --> 01:21.748
Actually, I got it performing
an incredible act of heroism.

01:23.834 --> 01:25.335
-(TIRES SCREECHING

01:25.502 --> 01:26.503
Oh, my God!

01:26.962 --> 01:28.964
Somebody help me. I'm sinking.

01:31.508 --> 01:35.179
- Hurry. I can't hold it.
- Okay. Let me just unstrap my baby.

01:35.804 --> 01:38.348
Oh, oh, oh. Slipping, slipping. Sorry.

01:43.020 --> 01:45.022
<i>- What do we want?</i>
- Fair wages.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.191
<i>- When do we want it?</i>
- Originally now.

01:47.274 --> 01:50.694
But it's been delayed until 9:40
due to weather in Philly.

01:51.570 --> 01:52.696
This is a mess.

01:52.988 --> 01:55.866
It's working about as well as
that animal sobriety checkpoint.

01:56.366 --> 01:58.994
Excuse me, sir. Is that a baggie
of catnip on your seat?

01:59.244 --> 02:00.996
I have a card for that.

02:01.288 --> 02:02.539
What else you got in here?

02:02.748 --> 02:05.459
Open container of cat food,
feather on the string.

02:05.918 --> 02:07.085
Is that a dead mouse?

02:07.461 --> 02:09.171
- Get him off me.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.798
Somebody get him off me!

02:25.103 --> 02:27.356
<i>Think catnip's a joke?</i>
<i>Think again.</i>

02:27.564 --> 02:30.692
<i>Vote yes on increased</i>
<i>animal sobriety checkpoints.</i>

02:30.984 --> 02:32.069
<i>Paid for by dogs.</i>

02:38.575 --> 02:41.286
Bachelorette party. Can I fit this in?

02:45.707 --> 02:47.042
Okay, cool. I got time.

02:48.794 --> 02:51.630
Hello, ladies.
Wow, here comes the bride, huh?

02:51.797 --> 02:53.590
More than once
if I have anything to do with it.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.759
Finally, the stripper's here.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.970
What? No, I'm not a stripper. I'm a pilot.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.223
See? This is a real uniform.

03:01.306 --> 03:04.351
Ooh. Take something else off, sexy.

03:05.727 --> 03:06.812
All right.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.607
Oh, yeah? You want a little more, huh?

03:14.528 --> 03:18.574
Yeah. All right. Who wants me
to stow my bag under their seat?

03:24.121 --> 03:27.833
Boy, and I thought that
Federal Hill bakery had nice buns.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.086
You're talented, Denise.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.130
You should really go for it.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.512
Wow, what a day.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.183
- Please, don't comment.
- Oh, look at you. Did you get a job?

03:44.349 --> 03:45.809
- Bitch.
- Did I get a job?

03:46.018 --> 03:48.312
This ain't a life vest, sister.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.732
It's a work vest from
a little place called Mega Hardware.

03:52.107 --> 03:53.692
Because that's basically what I am now.

03:53.817 --> 03:56.278
Just an everyday working-class Joe.

03:56.486 --> 03:57.946
Well, good for you.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.992
No. No, Brian.
This doesn't feel right today.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.996
- Yes.
- There's a rat trap in that cabinet.

04:06.288 --> 04:09.541
With a foot in it. And somewhere
in this house there's a footless rat.

04:09.875 --> 04:13.295
Well, I'm off to watch some Fox News
in front of the old boob tube.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.339
<i>Tommy used to work on the docks</i>

04:16.131 --> 04:18.467
<i>Union's been on strike</i>
<i>He's down on his luck</i>

04:18.634 --> 04:20.552
<i>It's tough, so tough</i>

04:25.849 --> 04:26.850
- Hey.
- No.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.268
- I wasn't sure.
- I'm sure.

04:28.352 --> 04:29.853
- Okay.
- Well, got to go.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.021
Got to do some more picketing.

04:31.313 --> 04:33.398
Seriously? It's like,
nine o'clock at night.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.692
Yeah, well... It's...

04:36.527 --> 04:37.986
Cleveland's stealing shot glasses.

04:39.530 --> 04:41.990
I don't like drinking Nyquil
out of 'em little cups.

04:47.454 --> 04:50.290
Where the hell's Quagmire going?
The airport's that way.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.042
He doesn't know we're following him, Joe.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.210
You don't have to duck down.

04:53.335 --> 04:55.963
I'm not. You took a pretty hard
right turn back there.

04:56.046 --> 04:57.297
I've been like this for a while.

05:05.138 --> 05:06.181
What's he doing?

05:06.265 --> 05:09.560
This is one of them places
where women go to see male strippers.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.395
Some bisexual men go as well.

05:17.818 --> 05:18.819
I don't see him.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.783
- Ladies, this is your pilot speaking.

05:24.867 --> 05:28.245
I am in the full, upright,
and locked position.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.587
Oh, my.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.228
Oh, my God. What are you guys doing here?

05:53.437 --> 05:54.938
Crap. Our disguises didn't work.

05:57.941 --> 06:00.277
Quagmire, I didn't know
you were a male stripper.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.613
I wasn't. Not until the strike, anyway.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.115
I've been out of work for three weeks.
I'm out of money.

06:05.282 --> 06:08.035
I had to do something.
God, I'm so embarrassed.

06:08.368 --> 06:10.829
Why? Stripping is a very
respectable profession.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.122
If it weren't respectable,

06:12.206 --> 06:14.625
why would real-estate agents
go to strip clubs for lunch?

06:14.750 --> 06:16.543
He's right. This is tremendous.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.128
Are you banging all these chicks?

06:18.295 --> 06:20.172
Hey, hey. That is offensive.

06:20.297 --> 06:21.965
I am a dancer, not a gigolo.

06:22.466 --> 06:25.219
Captain Cockpit,
my friend is about to get married,

06:25.302 --> 06:28.889
and we were wondering if you'd have
sex with her for $500?

06:31.016 --> 06:32.100
I'm a gigolo.

06:32.643 --> 06:33.852
Oh, hey, it's that guy.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.271
Are you gonna say,
"Who else but Quagmire"?

06:37.814 --> 06:39.149
No, I...

06:39.483 --> 06:42.486
Wanted to know if Quagmire
was available tomorrow evening?

06:42.986 --> 06:44.446
Are you gay?

06:44.530 --> 06:46.490
Of course not. No. I...

06:46.657 --> 06:49.660
But I am unable to properly
have sex with my wife,

06:49.743 --> 06:51.828
so, I figured, you know...

06:52.746 --> 06:54.122
Who else but Quagmire.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.917
Hey, awesome cameo.

07:04.007 --> 07:06.176
Hey, sorry I'm late, guys.
Had to stop at the dry cleaner.

07:06.343 --> 07:09.596
The dry cleaner?
Wow, somebody's struck it rich.

07:09.680 --> 07:12.015
You know, I got to tell you.
I was sweating that pilot strike.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.893
But now that I'm a gigolo,
I'm making money by the fistful.

07:15.561 --> 07:17.813
- Is that a giggity?
- That is a giggity.

07:18.313 --> 07:19.815
Quagmire, I couldn't help but notice

07:19.898 --> 07:22.568
you got some dry cleaning hanging up
in the backseat of your car.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.194
- Did you win the lottery?
- No.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.030
Well, I hope you're not
actually doing that gigolo thing.

07:27.114 --> 07:28.824
You know, prostitution is illegal.

07:29.157 --> 07:31.076
No, no. It's something else.

07:31.243 --> 07:35.497
Quagmire is selling
online Internet cyber stuff.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.624
Well, good for you, Quagmire.

07:39.168 --> 07:40.252
You and Gates, huh?

07:42.379 --> 07:44.882
Jeez, I got to go home
and change into my Tarzan costume.

07:45.340 --> 07:47.259
For the web.

07:48.051 --> 07:50.095
Huh. I got to get a computer.

07:56.185 --> 07:58.562
Excuse me.
How many BTUs does this grill have?

07:58.729 --> 08:01.857
Oh, man, that puppy,
more than you need, less than I want.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.902
Excuse me, do you
have a small grocery cart

08:04.985 --> 08:07.070
I could put this
boat-sized hunk of lumber in?

08:07.154 --> 08:08.280
Probably out in the parking lot.

08:08.405 --> 08:09.990
Can you tell me
where I can find extension cords?

08:10.157 --> 08:11.742
- Aisle 25.
- I was just there.

08:11.909 --> 08:13.619
- Twenty-six.
- There is no 26.

08:13.911 --> 08:14.953
Fifteen.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.831
- So, Gobi gets up on the lift.
- Don't mind me.

08:17.915 --> 08:20.918
Just grabbing myself a cup of mud.
I like mine black.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.377
Black as night.

08:22.753 --> 08:24.755
Black as sin.
Know what I'm sayin'?

08:25.088 --> 08:28.300
Haven't introduced myself.
Guys in my crew call me "the Ratchet."

08:28.926 --> 08:31.595
Brian, it's not your break.
Get out there and help the customers.

08:31.803 --> 08:34.932
"Brian"? Who are you, my father? This guy.

08:35.057 --> 08:36.517
- Get out there.
- Yes, sir.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.354
That guy's got no idea
how hard I'm working...

08:40.437 --> 08:42.606
Bird! A bird got in. Awesome.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.617
Hello? Hey, Quagmire.
What's going on?

08:54.284 --> 08:55.536
Oh, you need a ride? Yeah, sure.

08:55.619 --> 08:57.246
I can come and get you.
I'm not doing anything.

09:01.416 --> 09:04.962
Meg, that was the last guy.
So, just lock up when you are done.

09:12.094 --> 09:13.136
Thanks for the ride.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.013
One of my tricks drove
me here from the Clam,

09:15.097 --> 09:16.265
and I didn't have any money for a cab.

09:16.348 --> 09:18.267
Why not? Didn't she just pay you for sex?

09:18.350 --> 09:20.853
No. After it was over,
she said she wasn't gonna pay.

09:20.936 --> 09:22.104
Well, that ain't fair.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.439
You can't let these women
take advantage of you like that.

09:24.523 --> 09:26.275
What apartment is she in?
I'll go talk to her.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.901
She's in Unit 17.

09:27.985 --> 09:30.362
You know, if you're going back in
anyway, can you grab my belt?

09:30.654 --> 09:32.322
It's reversible, so I'd hate to lose it.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.996
Hey. You didn't pay my friend.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.498
So, I'm gonna play with your doorbell
until you pay up.

09:43.792 --> 09:44.835
Stop it!

09:44.960 --> 09:47.004
I can do this all day.
I love buttons.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.714
Fine! Here's your money!

09:50.591 --> 09:51.633
Here you go.

09:52.342 --> 09:53.844
Peter, this is amazing. Thank you.

09:53.969 --> 09:54.970
Hey, you know what?

09:55.053 --> 09:56.221
Here's a little something
for your trouble.

09:56.680 --> 09:57.931
You're giving me a cut?

09:58.348 --> 10:00.017
- Wow! Thanks.
- No problem.

10:00.350 --> 10:01.894
It's just too bad you're not here
every time.

10:02.311 --> 10:05.564
Well, I could be.
I mean, my days are pretty open.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.941
And I don't sleep a lot at night
'cause of health stuff.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.360
Huh, that'd be kind of nice, actually.

10:10.694 --> 10:12.613
Maybe you could drive me around
and help me out

10:12.696 --> 10:14.615
and I could even pay you
a little something for your time.

10:14.698 --> 10:16.033
Sure. That sounds great.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.117
You know what, it'll be nice to have a

10:17.201 --> 10:19.536
little extra cash to bet on college
football.

10:20.370 --> 10:21.747
Yeah, I'd like to bet 100 bucks.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.707
- You wanna pick a team?
- No, just take it.

10:31.256 --> 10:33.759
- I thought you had the day off.
- Maybe from the store.

10:33.842 --> 10:35.594
But it's not like things take
a day off from

10:35.677 --> 10:37.054
needing repairs. Am I right?

10:37.971 --> 10:40.807
Oh, looks like this cabinet door
is a good place to start.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.101
Yep. She's off-kilter.
I'm gonna have to plane her down.

10:43.227 --> 10:45.020
Lois, what year was this house built?

10:45.229 --> 10:47.523
I don't know. Maybe 1945?

10:47.731 --> 10:50.067
Good. It's grandfathered in.
I thought I'd need a variance.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.902
Don't want to get a code vi.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.655
"Vi" is violation. Code is just code.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.282
I don't know, Brian.
It looks straight to me.

10:57.366 --> 10:58.825
- What?
- It's straight.

10:59.034 --> 11:01.203
I don't know what that means.
"It's straight?"

11:01.411 --> 11:04.122
Oh, you mean "plum."
You're saying the door is plum.

11:04.289 --> 11:06.625
Wow, Brian. You do know all the lingo.

11:06.792 --> 11:09.378
Oh, come on.
It's just stuff you pick up on the side.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.380
I'm gonna go use a miter to jerry-rig

11:11.463 --> 11:13.340
a shim-jam strap hinge,
quarter-round-saw off

11:13.423 --> 11:16.301
a two-by-six
dowel cherry picker flimflam.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.429
You know, Rupert, Brian's douchiness
should infuriate me,

11:19.513 --> 11:21.723
but the truth is, he seems happy.

11:21.807 --> 11:23.976
So I guess I'll just do nothing
and that's that.

11:29.106 --> 11:30.440
Can't do it. Let's get him fired.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.197
<i>Some days won't end ever</i>
<i>And some days pass on by</i>

11:37.281 --> 11:40.117
<i>I'll be working here forever</i>
<i>At least until I die</i>

11:40.450 --> 11:43.287
<i>Damned if you do, damned if you don't</i>

11:43.370 --> 11:46.290
<i>I'm supposed to get a raise next week</i>
<i>You know damn well I won't</i>

11:46.415 --> 11:49.042
<i>- Workin' for a livin'</i>
<i>- Workin</i>

11:49.626 --> 11:51.753
<i>- Workin' for a livin'</i>
<i>- Workin</i>

11:52.629 --> 11:55.132
<i>Workin' for a livin', livin' and workin'</i>

11:55.215 --> 11:58.594
<i>I'm taking what they're giving</i>
<i>'Cause I'm workin' for a livin'</i>

11:58.677 --> 12:01.638
<i>Workin' for a livin'</i>
<i>Livin' and a-workin'</i>

12:11.899 --> 12:14.985
Boy, I have a whole new respect
for Hayden Panettiere.

12:16.862 --> 12:18.447
- Giggity.
- <i>I'm pulling up. You're ready?</i>

12:18.530 --> 12:20.866
Oh, hey, Peter. Listen,
I can't work tonight. I'm spent.

12:21.283 --> 12:24.077
That last trick was like trying to use
an empty bottle of hand soap.

12:24.161 --> 12:26.205
<i>But you got to work.</i>
<i>I set up five appointments.</i>

12:26.288 --> 12:28.207
<i>- That's a lot of money.</i>
- Sorry, I can't do it.

12:28.290 --> 12:29.333
You're just gonna have to cancel them.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.335
What the hell did you say to me?

12:31.793 --> 12:33.504
- Peter, what are you doing?
- You tripping, boy?

12:34.254 --> 12:36.423
You're going out
if I tell you you're going out, bitch.

12:36.715 --> 12:39.510
Okay. But what's in your pimp cup?

12:39.760 --> 12:42.179
It's actually a wheatgrass-ginger mixture.

12:42.387 --> 12:43.680
I was in the middle of a cleanse.

12:43.847 --> 12:45.307
I didn't know we'd be doing
this pimp thing

12:45.390 --> 12:47.267
but I made a promise to my body.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.019
Ahhh!

12:49.686 --> 12:50.896
Not great.

12:59.363 --> 13:02.616
Peter, what you doing all dressed
up for church? This ain't Easter.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.326
Oh, Cleveland.
These are my work clothes.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.828
- You're hosting <i>Family Feud?</i>
- No, I'm a pimp.

13:07.120 --> 13:10.290
Big Pete, if we're gonna be sitting,
may I use my penis donut?

13:10.374 --> 13:11.500
Bitch, I don't care.

13:12.125 --> 13:15.003
Dang, Quagmire. You're lucky.
He take care of you?

13:15.087 --> 13:16.338
Yeah. No, no. It's great.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.757
I'm making a lot of money.
I'm actually really happy.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.217
I'm actually very hungry.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.177
Nobody is gonna want you if you're fat.

13:22.386 --> 13:24.888
You wanna eat, get up to that bar
and earn your keep.

13:26.682 --> 13:28.475
What should I ask for, 500?

13:28.559 --> 13:30.811
You're not worth that much.
You're trash. Ask for two.

13:31.395 --> 13:34.189
You know I hit you and whore you out
because I love you, right?

13:36.066 --> 13:37.442
Hi there. You wanna party?

13:38.026 --> 13:39.403
And can I have some of your bread?

13:39.736 --> 13:41.655
Hi, handsome. You can't have my bread.

13:41.738 --> 13:45.033
But you can have something
of mine that smells like bread.

13:50.956 --> 13:53.417
- Okay, let's go.
- Just so you know,

13:53.750 --> 13:57.462
it takes me a long time.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.388
All right, Rupert. If we're going
to teach Brian a lesson,

14:06.471 --> 14:07.764
we're going to need some muscle.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.768
You, you, and you, 20 bucks
for the day. Hop in the back.

14:12.186 --> 14:13.228
No.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.148
Forget it. Just get in.

14:16.440 --> 14:19.026
Anyone who doesn't enjoy
the music of Josh Groban

14:19.109 --> 14:20.485
can get out of the fucking car.

14:21.069 --> 14:24.198
<i>You raise me up</i>

14:24.781 --> 14:27.284
Okay, if you had a friend
who worked at Mega Hardware,

14:27.492 --> 14:28.535
how would you get him fired?

14:28.952 --> 14:30.412
You ask him for papers.

14:30.621 --> 14:33.957
Okay, good. That, unfortunately,
won't work in this instance.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.460
But I like your effort, Luis.
Any other ideas?

14:36.627 --> 14:37.669
You could kill a guy.

14:38.295 --> 14:40.172
You know what, Carlos,
you stay quiet for a while.

14:40.255 --> 14:41.798
I really only need two of you.

14:41.924 --> 14:44.676
- You'll still be paid.
- You ask for papers.

14:44.843 --> 14:46.386
Okay, is there any idea out there

14:46.470 --> 14:48.555
besides killing a guy
or getting someone deported?

14:48.889 --> 14:51.058
We do good job, we live with you?

14:51.141 --> 14:52.518
Well, you just offered to kill a guy,

14:52.601 --> 14:55.270
so you're not exactly number one
on my roommate list.

14:55.354 --> 14:57.814
Now, let's go. I paid good money
for you. I need answers.

14:57.898 --> 15:01.276
I want your best and I won't stand
for even one more stupid idea.

15:02.194 --> 15:04.821
You shake a boss's soda, and give to him.

15:04.905 --> 15:06.949
When he open it, it explode.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.285
This is why I pushed you.

15:16.250 --> 15:19.211
Huh, I guess that Brian Griffin
is a good egg after all.

15:21.505 --> 15:23.340
Griffin! You're fired!

15:33.433 --> 15:35.310
<i>I never liked prostitutes</i>

15:35.394 --> 15:38.397
<i>because they sell their bodies</i>
<i>to all types of men.</i>

15:39.231 --> 15:42.609
<i>I turned my first trick</i>
<i>when I had my first one-night stand.</i>

15:42.985 --> 15:45.445
<i>I had sex for dinner and drinks.</i>

15:46.113 --> 15:48.115
<i>Being a prostitute is no fun.</i>

15:48.448 --> 15:50.576
<i>You have to work nights, weekends.</i>

15:50.826 --> 15:53.620
<i>I hear on</i> SNL <i>the women are funnier</i>
<i>than the guys now.</i>

15:53.704 --> 15:54.955
<i>But I don't know. I'll never see it.</i>

16:00.252 --> 16:04.047
<i>We meet Quagmire,</i>
<i>a small town boy with big city dreams,</i>

16:04.131 --> 16:07.551
<i>who has fallen deep into</i>
<i>the game of prostitution at the Point.</i>

16:09.928 --> 16:13.682
You know, some people ask me,
would you want your son to be a hooker?

16:13.807 --> 16:16.852
My answer is always, "Hey, lady,
are we talking or am I beefing you?"

16:19.146 --> 16:21.231
I kinda wanna see
<i>Guardians of the Galaxy</i>

16:21.315 --> 16:24.151
but I also kind of feel like
there might be scary parts.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.446
Hey, honey. You're shopping for groceries?

16:28.155 --> 16:29.156
You know what that means?

16:29.364 --> 16:32.784
Shopping for groceries is what I say
instead of, "Do you wanna pay me for sex?"

16:32.868 --> 16:33.994
So, I can't get arrested.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.099
Stewie, did you hire three Mexican guys

16:56.225 --> 16:58.018
to shake a soda can and give
it to my boss?

16:58.352 --> 16:59.561
What?

16:59.853 --> 17:00.979
One's Guatemalan.

17:01.063 --> 17:04.608
- Damn it, Stewie. You got me fired.
- Who you kidding? You got yourself fired,

17:04.858 --> 17:07.528
parading around there, pretending
you know the first thing about tools.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.197
You know what, you're going down there
with me right now

17:10.322 --> 17:11.365
to tell them what you did.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.493
Get your hands off me.
I'll go floppy dead weight on you.

17:17.579 --> 17:20.207
Oh, crap. My stomach.
I think my hernia ruptured.

17:20.332 --> 17:23.168
- Oh, my God.
- Damn it, it's bad. It's bad.

17:23.252 --> 17:24.920
I'll get Lois.
She can take you to the hospital.

17:25.045 --> 17:28.215
No, she can't. Thanks to you,
I don't have insurance anymore.

17:28.382 --> 17:30.342
What are we gonna do?
I'll get the gun.

17:30.551 --> 17:34.054
- No, Stewie. You have to fix me.
- What? I'm not a doctor.

17:34.304 --> 17:36.056
Just look it up on your phone
or something.

17:36.682 --> 17:38.642
Hold on. I have gotta update iOS.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.768
Stewie!

17:40.727 --> 17:41.770
Okay, okay. Got it.

17:41.854 --> 17:45.023
It says I have to make an incision,
retract the hernia sac

17:45.107 --> 17:48.151
and then suture the abdominal lining.
How am I supposed to do that?

17:48.235 --> 17:51.363
Grab my tool belt. Use the
self-sharpening linoleum blade.

17:55.158 --> 17:57.077
And then hold the incision
open with a vice grip.

17:57.244 --> 18:00.414
And use the slip joint pliers
to get the muscle back in position.

18:01.582 --> 18:04.042
Okay. Okay, now it's saying
I have to suture it.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.253
I've got some monofilament
line you can use.

18:06.336 --> 18:08.839
It's from aisle eight,
above the chains and cables.

18:08.922 --> 18:12.384
Monofilament lines? Slip joint pliers?
I got to say, Brian,

18:12.467 --> 18:14.761
it seems like you really did learn
something on that job.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.222
You're right. I guess I did.

18:17.472 --> 18:19.016
But please, stitch me up.

18:19.099 --> 18:20.517
Just be careful and take your time.

18:20.601 --> 18:23.896
- This is the delicate part, because...
- Yeah. I'm gonna just use the staple gun.

18:23.979 --> 18:25.772
Damn it!

18:26.273 --> 18:28.025
You know what, that was really easy.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.777
That guy who killed Joan Rivers
must be terrible at this.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.410
Hey, there. Oh. What are you doing here?

18:38.493 --> 18:42.831
Quagmire? I have a hobby
that takes me this way.

18:42.915 --> 18:45.125
Hey, I'm freezing.
You got a blanket in there or something?

18:45.250 --> 18:48.420
I got a towel. But it's wet
because I'm eating peaches.

18:49.004 --> 18:51.465
I lied about the hobby. I was sinning.

18:52.049 --> 18:54.468
I'm going to drive away backwards now.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.975
- Hey, baby. You wanna party?
- Get in.

19:09.483 --> 19:10.609
You guys having a good night?

19:11.944 --> 19:13.529
I like that it's getting dark earlier.

19:14.238 --> 19:16.240
What are you guys gonna be for Halloween?

19:16.532 --> 19:19.159
Big Pete, help.
She want to do German things.

19:19.243 --> 19:20.494
German things!

19:20.786 --> 19:23.830
What? No! He hasn't eaten anything
in days. It's not gonna work.

19:25.332 --> 19:26.500
<i>Nein! Nein!</i>

19:30.379 --> 19:32.881
She's got us both.
Help us, pimps and hos!

19:33.090 --> 19:34.925
Help us, HBO camera crew!

19:40.055 --> 19:42.975
God, Quagmire, most of that was horrible.

19:43.350 --> 19:46.228
I know. Eventually,
I might want to try it again.

19:46.478 --> 19:49.022
Hey, listen, buddy.
I'm sorry about all this.

19:49.690 --> 19:51.733
I guess I just got caught up
in the money and...

19:51.817 --> 19:54.528
And assumed you were okay
with it because of the sex.

19:54.653 --> 19:56.113
I don't know. Peter.
I think you're just mad

19:56.196 --> 19:58.323
I didn't come to see
your Pretenders cover band.

19:58.490 --> 19:59.658
Yes, well, that may be.

19:59.908 --> 20:03.245
Speaking of which, the Pretend-Pretenders
are playing again this weekend.

20:03.537 --> 20:06.707
Much like the real band,
we have been described as "meh".

20:07.624 --> 20:09.001
Still, I'm really sorry.

20:09.251 --> 20:11.086
Can you find it in yourself to forgive me

20:11.170 --> 20:13.255
and maybe we can just
go back to being friends?

20:13.755 --> 20:14.882
I'd like that.

20:15.007 --> 20:18.051
Hopefully the pilots' strike will end soon
and I can get my old job back.

20:18.135 --> 20:19.803
Oh, the strike ended a month ago.

20:19.970 --> 20:21.889
- What? Why didn't you tell me?
- I did.

20:22.264 --> 20:25.434
Are you still GlenQten-at-aol.com?

20:25.726 --> 20:27.895
- No!
- Ah. Well, there you go.

20:32.774 --> 20:35.402
Well, I'm glad Quagmire's
back to work for the airline

20:35.485 --> 20:38.071
and that whole gigolo
and pimping thing is over.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.489
You knew about that?

20:39.573 --> 20:42.576
You know what, you were sticking
to your cleanse, so I didn't really care.

20:43.035 --> 20:44.244
I got to hand it to you, Brian.

20:44.369 --> 20:46.580
You are a better blue-collar
guy than I expected.

20:46.830 --> 20:50.501
- You finally earned this nice, cold beer.
- Thanks, Stewie.

20:52.294 --> 20:53.462
Nice work, Pedro.

20:53.587 --> 20:55.506
Let us know if you want us to kill a guy.

20:55.672 --> 20:57.299
- Okay.
- It could be anyone.

20:57.382 --> 21:01.220
Got it. You have no idea
how hard they tried to pierce my ears.
