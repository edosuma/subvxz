'COURSE, HE WASN'T.

13:22.002 --> 13:25.272
AW, THAT'S THE SADDEST
STORY I EVER HEARD.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.809
WELL, AFTER THAT
I SWORE I'D NEVER GET CLOSE

13:29.877 --> 13:32.045
TO ANOTHER PET AGAIN.

13:32.512 --> 13:33.847
[HONK]

13:36.884 --> 13:38.185
I'M SORRY.

13:38.251 --> 13:42.522
CARL, THAT WAS 20 YEARS AGO.
GET SOME THERAPY.

13:42.589 --> 13:45.859
HARRIETTE, I'M JUST TRYING TO
SPARE THE KIDS THE SAME PAIN.

13:45.926 --> 13:49.963
OH, COME ON, CARL YOU HAD 10
WONDERFUL YEARS WITH THAT DOG.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.198
WELL, YEAH, BUT--

13:51.264 --> 13:53.033
AND THINK ABOUT
THE GOOD IT DID FOR YOU.

13:53.100 --> 13:55.735
I MEAN, IT TAUGHT YOU
ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY

13:55.802 --> 13:57.504
AND HOW TO LOVE.

13:57.570 --> 13:58.906
[WHINING]

13:59.572 --> 14:01.408
YEAH, DAD.

14:01.474 --> 14:04.211
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

14:05.345 --> 14:08.015
PLEASSSSE?

14:08.081 --> 14:10.383
OH, ALRIGHT.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.584
YES, DAD!

14:13.453 --> 14:14.821
YOU CAN KEEP HIM,

14:14.888 --> 14:16.890
BUT THIS DOG
IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

14:16.957 --> 14:20.093
THE THREE OF YOU HAVE GOT TO
WALK HIM, BRUSH HIM, FEED HIM,

14:20.160 --> 14:23.230
AND MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL
KEEP HIM AWAY FROM ME.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.899
DON'T WORRY, DAD. HE DOES
WHATEVER WE SAY.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.035
SIT, MICKEY.

14:28.101 --> 14:30.070
OH!
SIT, MICKEY!

14:30.137 --> 14:34.607
HEY, I SAID SIT!
SIT, MICKEY!

14:34.674 --> 14:36.910
I MEAN IT! SIT!

14:39.079 --> 14:40.547
BYE DAD, WE'RE GOING
TO THE MALL.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.682
WAIT A MINUTE, DID YOU
TAKE CARE OF THE DOG?

14:42.749 --> 14:44.151
I FED HIM, EDDIE BRUSHED HIM

14:44.217 --> 14:47.187
AND HE DRAGGED JUDY AROUND
THE BLOCK THREE TIMES.

14:47.254 --> 14:50.490
WELL, GOOD. JUST PUT HIM
IN THE KITCHEN OUT OF MY WAY.

15:01.834 --> 15:03.170
HI, CARL.

15:05.438 --> 15:08.741
DON'T YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO
START CALLING ME MR. WINSLOW?

15:08.808 --> 15:12.412
YEAH. THAT'S WHAT MY PARENTS,
HERB AND DIANE, TELL ME.

15:14.614 --> 15:15.748
WHERE'S LAURA?

15:15.815 --> 15:18.351
SHE'S GONE
FOR THE DAY.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.420
OH. I'LL WAIT.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.495
WANT ANYTHING
FROM THE FRIDGE?

15:29.829 --> 15:32.199
DON'T HERB AND DIANE
EVER FEED YOU?

15:32.265 --> 15:35.568
THEY USUALLY
SEND ME OUT.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.106
OW! STOP! STOP!

15:40.740 --> 15:43.576
STOP! STOP! AAH!

15:45.112 --> 15:47.247
SO, YOU GOT A DOG.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.653
GOT TO RUN, CARL.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.122
TELL LAURA
I'LL CALL HER.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.590
CUTE DOG.
I THINK HE LIKES ME.

16:02.996 --> 16:04.497
GOOD DOG.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.133
GOOD DOG.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.776
THAT'S IT. I'VE HAD IT
WITH THAT DOG.

16:16.843 --> 16:18.211
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:18.278 --> 16:21.581
LOOK, WHAT HE DID
TO MY ALGEBRA HOMEWORK.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.283
JUST TELL YOUR TEACHER
YOUR DOG ATE IT.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.719
I CAN'T. I USED THAT EXCUSE
BEFORE WE GOT THE DOG.

16:28.821 --> 16:32.592
WELL, LISTEN, YOU ALL COME ON,
SIT DOWN AND EAT YOUR BREAKFAST,

16:32.659 --> 16:35.228
AND EDDIE, DON'T FORGET
TO FEED MICKEY

16:35.295 --> 16:36.463
BEFORE YOU GO TO SCHOOL.

16:36.529 --> 16:41.268
MOM, ALL THAT DOG
DOES IS EAT.

16:42.535 --> 16:43.936
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.206
MY SCIENCE PROJECT
IS RUINED.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.076
WHAT HAPPENED?

16:49.142 --> 16:51.311
I SPENT TWO WEEKS
MAKING A PAPIER-MACHE

16:51.378 --> 16:52.745
MODEL OF OUR SOLAR SYSTEM

16:52.812 --> 16:55.615
AND LAST NIGHT, MICKEY
TOOK A BITE OUT OF PLUTO.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.518
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

16:58.585 --> 17:00.053
TAKE THE DOG OUTTA
THE STREET, GIVE HIM A HOME

17:00.120 --> 17:02.189
AND THIS IS
THE THANKS I GET?

17:05.024 --> 17:06.659
HEY, EVERYBODY,
YOU GOT TO SEE THIS.

17:06.726 --> 17:09.729
THIS DOG IS A GENIUS.
COME HERE, MICKEY.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.998
SIT, MICKEY.

17:12.065 --> 17:13.500
SPEAK, SPEAK.

17:13.566 --> 17:14.067
[WOOF]

17:14.134 --> 17:15.902
[WOOF]
SPEAK.

17:15.968 --> 17:17.337
THAT'S GREAT.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.806
HARRIETTE, I SURE WISH
OUR KIDS WERE THIS WELL-BEHAVED.

17:25.512 --> 17:27.947
WELL, I THINK I'LL GO
TO WORK NOW. SEE YOU LATER.

17:28.014 --> 17:29.048
ALRIGHT, SWEETIE.
HAVE A NICE DAY.

17:29.116 --> 17:30.883
OKAY.

17:30.950 --> 17:32.285
BYE, MICK.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.356
HEY, HE TOOK
OUR BACON!

17:36.423 --> 17:39.092
MICKEY! MICKEY!
HARRIETTE?

17:39.159 --> 17:40.327
MICKEY!
HARRIETTE!

17:40.393 --> 17:42.429
WHAT?

17:42.495 --> 17:44.131
HAVE YOU SEEN
MY WORKOUT SUIT?

17:44.197 --> 17:46.499
IT'S IN THE LAUNDRY ROOM.
OH, THANKS.

17:48.501 --> 17:49.636
AAH!

17:56.042 --> 17:58.178
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:58.245 --> 18:00.113
LOOKS LIKE
MICKEY STRUCK AGAIN.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.583
WELL, HE'S A DOG.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

18:03.650 --> 18:07.154
MOM, ISN'T THAT
YOUR NEW SILK BLOUSE?

18:09.021 --> 18:10.990
THAT'S IT. THAT DOG
IS OUT OF HERE.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.859
MICKEY! MICKEY!

18:17.497 --> 18:19.732
HI, EVERYBODY.
WHERE'S MICKEY?

18:19.799 --> 18:22.735
HERE, BOY. HERE, MICKEY.
LOOK WHAT I GOT HIM.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.205
A FRISBEE.

18:25.272 --> 18:27.540
HELP HIM DEVELOP GREAT
EYE-SNOUT COORDINATION.

18:28.408 --> 18:30.377
HERE, BOY.
CARL. CARL.

18:30.443 --> 18:32.579
SIT DOWN.
WE NEED TO TALK.

18:33.880 --> 18:37.450
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG?

18:37.517 --> 18:39.085
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU ABOUT MICKEY.

18:39.152 --> 18:42.054
OH, NO. IS HE SICK?
IS HE LOST?

18:42.121 --> 18:44.624
CARL, HE'S FINE.
HE'S IN THE GARAGE.

18:44.691 --> 18:46.125
IN THE GARAGE? WHY?

18:46.193 --> 18:48.027
CARL,
HE'S DESTRUCTIVE.

18:48.094 --> 18:51.731
HE'S EATEN CLOTHES AND FURNITURE
AND SPORTING EQUIPMENT,

18:51.798 --> 18:55.335
AND I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
HE LOOKS AT LITTLE RICHIE.

18:55.402 --> 18:57.404
WELL, THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE MY DOG.

18:57.470 --> 19:01.741
MY DOG IS A SWEET, GENTLE,
PLAYFUL LITTLE PUPPY.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.943
CARL...

19:04.010 --> 19:06.346
AROUND YOU,
HE'S BENJI.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.548
AROUND US, HE'S CUJO.

19:10.183 --> 19:11.651
WELL, HE'LL GROW OUT OF IT.
HE'S....

19:11.718 --> 19:13.886
HE'S STILL ADJUSTING
TO HIS NEW SURROUNDINGS.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.722
CARL, HE'S A BIG DOG,

19:15.788 --> 19:18.358
TOO BIG TO BE PENT-UP
IN THE HOUSE ALL DAY.

19:18.425 --> 19:20.293
HE NEEDS ROOM TO RUN
AND PLAY.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.128
WELL, I-I TAKE HIM
TO THE PARK.

19:22.195 --> 19:24.931
CARL, HE'S AN ACTIVE
OUTDOOR DOG.

19:24.997 --> 19:27.700
HE NEEDS TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY.
NOT IN THE CITY.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.536
WELL, WE'LL...

19:29.602 --> 19:31.838
WE'LL SELL THE HOUSE
AND BUY A FARM.

19:31.904 --> 19:35.275
CARL, COME ON.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.378
WELL, DOES EVERYBODY
FEEL THIS WAY?

19:38.445 --> 19:39.145
YES.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.780
DEFINITELY.
YUP.

19:42.449 --> 19:46.386
WELL, ALRIGHT, I'LL
FIND HIM A NICE HOME,

19:46.453 --> 19:50.957
BUT PLEASE LET ME BE
THE ONE TO BREAK IT TO HIM.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.525
I DIDN'T WANT
TO MENTION THIS,

19:52.592 --> 19:56.629
BUT HE'S NOT CRAZY
ABOUT THE REST OF YOU.

20:18.251 --> 20:22.889
WELL, BIG GUY, I GUESS YOU
AND I GOT TO SAY GOODBYE.

20:24.757 --> 20:25.858
OHH.

20:27.460 --> 20:30.229
I KNOW, I KNOW.

20:30.297 --> 20:32.632
HEY, BUT THIS IS
HARD FOR ME, TOO.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.172
BUT I MADE A FEW
PHONE CALLS,

20:40.239 --> 20:42.909
AND I FOUND YOU
A REAL NICE HOME.

20:42.975 --> 20:45.412
IT'S IN THE COUNTRY.

20:45.478 --> 20:48.615
YOU'LL HAVE SOMEBODY
TO TAKE YOU HUNTING...

20:48.681 --> 20:49.816
FISHING.

20:51.284 --> 20:52.985
A LOT OF SPACE
FOR YOU TO DIG HOLES

20:53.052 --> 20:55.388
AND...CHASE RABBITS,

20:56.589 --> 20:58.958
AND A WHOLE FOREST
FOR YOU TO CHEW ON.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.495
THAT SOUNDS OKAY, RIGHT?

21:13.406 --> 21:15.608
I'M REALLY GOING
TO MISS YOU, TOO, PAL.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.345
IT'S BEEN NICE KNOWING YOU.

21:29.722 --> 21:32.425
WELL, I JUST DROPPED
MICKEY OFF AT HIS NEW HOME.

21:32.492 --> 21:33.826
HOW DID IT GO?

21:33.893 --> 21:36.396
THERE WAS A LOT OF WHIMPERING
AND SNIFFLING.

21:36.463 --> 21:39.866
YEAH, BUT HOW DID
MICKEY TAKE IT?

21:39.932 --> 21:43.836
OKAY, I GUESS, BUT HE'S SURE
GOING TO MISS ME.

21:44.771 --> 21:46.606
I'M SURE GOING
TO MISS HIM.

21:46.673 --> 21:47.807
AW.

21:51.010 --> 21:52.379
DAD, YOU WERE RIGHT.

21:52.445 --> 21:54.947
HAVING A PET IS
A BIG RESPONSIBILITY.

21:55.014 --> 21:58.618
YEAH. AT LEAST YOU FOUND
MICKEY A GOOD HOME.

21:58.685 --> 22:00.587
AND YOU STILL
HAVE US.

22:04.256 --> 22:05.692
HI, EVERYBODY.

22:06.993 --> 22:09.662
I COULD'VE SWORN
I LOCKED THAT DOOR.

22:09.729 --> 22:13.433
YOU DID. I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF MAKING MY OWN KEY.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.570
WHAT DO YOU WANT, STEVE?

22:17.637 --> 22:21.508
YOU MEAN
BESIDES LAURA?

22:28.047 --> 22:29.148
I NOTICED
FROM MY WINDOW

22:29.215 --> 22:33.185
THAT YOU GOT RID
OF YOUR DOG. WISE CHOICE.

22:33.252 --> 22:34.754
BUT KNOWING HOW
IMPORTANT IT IS

22:34.821 --> 22:36.656
FOR EVERY MAN
TO HAVE A PET,

22:36.723 --> 22:40.793
I BROUGHT
YOU THIS.

22:43.062 --> 22:45.398
OH, AN ANT FARM.

22:47.333 --> 22:49.268
I DON'T SEE ANY ANTS.

22:49.335 --> 22:51.704
OH, YOU HAVE TO
SEND OFF FOR THEM,

22:51.771 --> 22:54.974
BUT, DON'T WORRY.
I KNEW THIS WAS AN EMERGENCY,

22:55.041 --> 22:58.945
SO I BROUGHT YOU SOME
FROM MY OWN PERSONAL SUPPLY.

23:00.980 --> 23:05.351
THERE ARE 5,000 IN THERE,
INCLUDING A PREGNANT QUEEN.

23:05.418 --> 23:07.086
YOU SEE, THERE SHE--

23:07.153 --> 23:09.889
NO!
OH, NO!
AAH!
AAH!

23:12.124 --> 23:13.192
OH!

23:13.259 --> 23:14.994
YOUR MAJESTY,

23:15.061 --> 23:16.696
YOUR MAJESTY.
