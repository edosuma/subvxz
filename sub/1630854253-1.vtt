24:11.020 --> 24:14.219
- <i> All right, and Gerald,</i>
<i>show us what we have</i> .

24:19.765 --> 24:21.061
- Hey, el vino?

24:21.096 --> 24:22.392
- Oh, no, I'm okay.

24:22.427 --> 24:23.195
- Yeah.

24:23.230 --> 24:24.328
- Yeah.

24:29.104 --> 24:30.268
- You okay?

24:31.238 --> 24:32.039
- Yeah.

24:33.273 --> 24:34.338
Yeah.

24:38.179 --> 24:39.244
- Hey,

24:41.182 --> 24:42.181
you know?

24:44.625 --> 24:46.251
- Yeah, I love you too.

24:49.729 --> 24:51.223
We need to talk.

24:51.258 --> 24:52.290
- Yeah.

24:52.963 --> 24:53.764
- Yeah?

24:55.603 --> 24:56.393
- Yeah.

24:58.771 --> 25:01.101
I'm gonna be heading
out West tomorrow

25:01.136 --> 25:03.433
for that job just
for a little bit

25:03.468 --> 25:05.138
until I can make this all work.

25:06.042 --> 25:07.272
- It is working.

25:07.307 --> 25:09.582
- No, it is, of
course it is, but.

25:09.617 --> 25:13.179
- So are you going to work
or are you just running away?

25:13.214 --> 25:17.480
- Come on, I'm working
just for a couple of weeks.

25:20.122 --> 25:21.792
- Sell no shit.

25:21.827 --> 25:22.793
- I swear to God.

25:24.489 --> 25:25.730
Okay, this isn't the end,

25:25.765 --> 25:27.897
it's just a little
pause for now.

25:30.066 --> 25:30.999
Okay?

25:33.674 --> 25:35.135
- Okay.

25:42.243 --> 25:44.408
- Did you wanna talk
about something?

25:44.443 --> 25:46.418
- Oh, it was nothing.

26:22.855 --> 26:24.151
- <i> If</i>
<i>the cops were gonna be</i>

26:24.186 --> 26:25.823
<i>looking for me out East,</i>

26:25.858 --> 26:27.726
<i>then it only made</i>
<i>sense to head west.</i>

26:29.158 --> 26:32.797
<i>Besides, I'd already used my</i>
<i>get outta jail free card.</i>

26:33.701 --> 26:35.294
- Unemployment is
pretty high these days,

26:35.329 --> 26:36.933
so there aren't that many jobs,

26:36.968 --> 26:39.199
only people making
cash in banks,

26:39.234 --> 26:42.367
loan defaults, jacked
interest rates, foreclosures.

26:42.402 --> 26:43.874
You know how it is.

26:43.909 --> 26:45.370
Oh, here's one.

26:49.013 --> 26:50.375
- Part-time dishwasher?

26:51.246 --> 26:53.213
That doesn't even
pay minimum wage.

26:54.414 --> 26:58.185
I have no residence,
I can't get welfare.

27:00.354 --> 27:02.024
- I'd give you my
job if I could.

27:04.226 --> 27:05.995
- I'm here for
the dishwasher position.

27:06.030 --> 27:08.360
- Ah, sorry, man,
I filled that this morning.

27:08.395 --> 27:09.625
- Seriously.

27:09.660 --> 27:11.198
- I don't know what you
want me to tell you.

27:11.233 --> 27:12.661
- They told me that
there was a spot.

27:12.696 --> 27:13.772
- People need work.

27:14.698 --> 27:17.336
You seem like a
nice guy, good luck.

27:18.174 --> 27:19.877
- <i> A president's</i>
<i>greatest responsibility</i>

27:19.912 --> 27:22.176
<i>is to protect all our</i>
<i>people from enemies,</i>

27:22.211 --> 27:23.639
<i>foreign and domestic.</i>

27:23.674 --> 27:27.313
<i>Here at home, the worst</i>
<i>enemy we face is economic.</i>

27:27.348 --> 27:30.382
<i>The creeping erosion of</i>

27:30.417 --> 27:32.186
<i>and the American Dream</i>

<i>in today's tragedy of economic</i>
<i>stagnation and unemployment.</i>

27:37.127 --> 27:38.522
- Come on, please.

27:38.557 --> 27:40.392
- No, listen
to your mother.

29:21.033 --> 29:21.801
- Hello.

29:23.332 --> 29:25.134
<i>Robert, is that you?</i>

29:25.169 --> 29:26.267
- Yeah, it's me.

29:26.302 --> 29:27.697
- Where are you?

29:27.732 --> 29:29.303
<i>- Vancouver.</i>

29:29.338 --> 29:32.372
Realizing that this is probably
the longest week of my life.

29:32.407 --> 29:34.176
Just being away from you.

29:34.211 --> 29:35.540
- Then come home.

29:36.378 --> 29:37.377
<i>- I will.</i>

29:37.412 --> 29:38.675
<i>- When?</i>

29:38.710 --> 29:42.448
- I don't know, soon,
maybe a couple of weeks.

29:45.552 --> 29:46.749
- Robert, I'm pregnant.

29:50.491 --> 29:52.161
- With a baby?

29:52.196 --> 29:53.459
- I can do this on my own,

29:53.494 --> 29:55.065
I just, I thought
you should know and.

29:55.903 --> 29:57.595
- We're gonna be a family?

29:59.203 --> 30:00.664
- Is that what you want?

30:00.699 --> 30:01.500
- Yeah.

30:03.042 --> 30:04.701
Yeah, you know that I do.

30:04.736 --> 30:06.505
<i>Oh my God, you're gonna</i>
<i>be the best mother</i>

30:06.540 --> 30:09.475
and I'm gonna be a fucking dad.

30:09.510 --> 30:10.509
Are you kidding me?

30:10.544 --> 30:12.313
<i>Oh, we are gonna give this kid</i>

30:12.348 --> 30:15.811
the best home and family
anybody has ever seen, babe.

30:15.846 --> 30:18.088
- Listen, home will
be wherever we are.

30:18.123 --> 30:20.519
Just do whatever you
gotta do to get back okay.

30:20.554 --> 30:21.355
- I will.

30:22.424 --> 30:26.690
Okay, I gotta go, I gotta go.

30:26.725 --> 30:28.527
And I will call you
soon okay, I love you.

30:28.562 --> 30:29.594
- Bye.

30:34.469 --> 30:35.798
- Oh my God.

30:37.142 --> 30:38.438
Oh my God.

30:39.078 --> 30:40.704
I'm gonna be a.

30:45.480 --> 30:48.514
Hey, I'm gonna be a dad.

30:48.549 --> 30:50.648
I'm gonna be a dad.

30:55.589 --> 30:56.588
Holy shit.

30:59.296 --> 31:01.230
I'm gonna be a dad.

31:13.013 --> 31:14.078
Holy shit.

32:00.720 --> 32:01.994
You an actor?

32:02.458 --> 32:03.655
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:03.690 --> 32:05.998
I'm an actor, starving actor.

32:06.033 --> 32:07.791
Got an audition
for a play tomorrow

32:07.826 --> 32:09.661
and trying to go in character.

32:10.631 --> 32:11.861
Not really sure what
I'm gonna do yet.

32:11.896 --> 32:13.434
- Yeah, I hear you.

32:13.469 --> 32:16.107
- Hey, is there a chance
that I could borrow something

32:16.142 --> 32:19.011
and leave you my ID and then
bring it back after I'm done.

32:31.718 --> 32:34.455
- Hi, how come
no one stopped me

32:34.490 --> 32:36.358
when I came around the corner?

32:36.393 --> 32:39.163
Bill Bonnie,
institution security.

32:39.198 --> 32:40.692
I'm here for a routine checkup

32:40.727 --> 32:44.069
and I'm wondering if I
could speak to your manager.

32:47.569 --> 32:49.899
- There's not enough
in budgets these days.

32:49.934 --> 32:53.177
So we rely on the local
guards for security.

32:53.212 --> 32:56.147
- So, I coulda just walk
right in and outta here.

32:56.182 --> 32:58.512
- Well, we haven't
had any problems yet.

32:58.547 --> 32:59.513
- Yet?

33:01.517 --> 33:04.012
Okay, let's say somebody
does get back here

33:04.047 --> 33:05.750
and they say, "Open the vault."

33:06.885 --> 33:07.917
What do you say?

33:08.953 --> 33:09.754
- We comply.

33:10.922 --> 33:13.021
He says, "Don't
give me a dye pack."

33:13.056 --> 33:14.825
We don't give him one.

33:14.860 --> 33:17.465
He says, "Don't press
the silent alarm."

33:18.270 --> 33:19.137
We don't press it.

33:19.931 --> 33:22.173
And if you have any
other questions,

33:22.208 --> 33:23.933
you can talk to Jessica
our assistant manager,

33:23.968 --> 33:25.275
she'll be happy to help.

33:25.310 --> 33:26.606
- Okay.

33:26.641 --> 33:28.080
Great, great.

33:29.578 --> 33:30.379
Good stuff.

33:32.812 --> 33:34.284
- Okay.
- Thanks.

33:38.224 --> 33:39.685
- Hey.
- Hello.

33:39.720 --> 33:42.358
- I understand you
guys do the security

33:42.393 --> 33:43.557
for all the banks in the area.

33:43.592 --> 33:44.624
- Right, it's true.

33:44.659 --> 33:46.263
- Mind if I give you my resume?

33:46.298 --> 33:48.760
- No, I'm sorry,
we are not hiring.

33:48.795 --> 33:50.201
- Oh.
- So sorry.

33:50.236 --> 33:51.730
- Well, that's too bad.

33:51.765 --> 33:52.863
- Yes.

33:52.898 --> 33:53.765
- How many guys do
you have on per day?

33:53.800 --> 33:55.140
Maybe you could use another.

33:55.175 --> 33:56.768
- Ah, I am very sorry.

33:56.803 --> 33:58.209
No, I'm here Monday to Wednesday

33:58.244 --> 34:00.541
and the other guy, he is
here straight to Saturday.

34:00.576 --> 34:01.872
- I'm a martial artist.

34:01.907 --> 34:04.446
Yeah, specializing in
like hand to hand combat.

34:04.481 --> 34:05.942
Registered to carry side arm.

34:05.977 --> 34:06.811
- No?
- Oh yeah.

34:06.846 --> 34:07.812
Oh yeah.

34:07.847 --> 34:10.122
- Very impressive.

34:10.157 --> 34:11.816
- Ah, thank you, thank you.

34:11.851 --> 34:14.225
- Unfortunately,
no one is leaving.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.391
- Okay.

34:15.426 --> 34:16.161
- I am sorry.

34:16.196 --> 34:18.053
- No, that's fine.

34:18.088 --> 34:18.955
Things change.

34:18.990 --> 34:20.231
So why don't you go ahead

34:20.266 --> 34:21.529
and just pass it onto
your boss for me.

34:23.797 --> 34:24.730
Thank you.

34:24.765 --> 34:25.797
Merci.

34:26.602 --> 34:31.099
Enchanté, it's me, Michel
down at the Royal East,

34:31.134 --> 34:32.342
just spoke with the boss

34:32.377 --> 34:33.673
and he said that they're
cutting back shifts.

34:33.708 --> 34:35.279
They won't need you tomorrow.

34:36.106 --> 34:38.513
Motherfucker did say that
he would be making it up

34:38.548 --> 34:39.910
in the Christmas bonus.

34:39.945 --> 34:42.352
So I guess that's good.

34:43.718 --> 34:44.849
Okay.

34:44.884 --> 34:46.884
Très bien. Au revoir.

34:49.493 --> 34:52.857
- All right, continuing
on special effects makeup.

34:52.892 --> 34:55.629
Okay, so we've covered the eyes,

34:55.664 --> 34:57.664
we've covered the ears.

34:57.699 --> 35:00.502
Now on to the nose.

35:00.537 --> 35:02.801
Polyurethane works great.

35:02.836 --> 35:04.770
But in a pinch,

35:04.805 --> 35:08.642
melt Vaseline with candle wax,

35:08.677 --> 35:09.940
and you're on your way.

35:11.251 --> 35:15.011
- You were
great, thank you so much.

36:05.569 --> 36:06.931
- Is that all for you today?

36:06.966 --> 36:07.998
All right, that's good.

36:08.033 --> 36:09.604
- All right, it's
nice to see you.

36:09.639 --> 36:11.507
See you next time.
Have a good day.

36:12.741 --> 36:14.675
Hi, can I help who's next?

36:14.710 --> 36:16.512
Hello.
- Hi Jessica, how are you?

36:16.547 --> 36:18.349
- Great, how can I help you?

36:18.384 --> 36:20.846
- Well if you
could just go ahead

36:20.881 --> 36:22.815
and take a look at
that for me, please.

36:25.391 --> 36:28.359
- Oh, need your help here.

36:28.394 --> 36:29.294
I can't...

36:30.429 --> 36:31.593
Don't?

36:31.628 --> 36:35.300
- Oh, it says, don't scream.

36:35.335 --> 36:36.565
Empty your drawers.

36:39.339 --> 36:40.734
- Oh.

36:40.769 --> 36:43.638
- Don't bother with the
silent alarm, no dye packs.

36:43.673 --> 36:46.377
Cops will be here in
two to five minutes.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.907
You'll be safe then,
if you're cool now.

36:50.416 --> 36:51.140
- I can't.

36:51.175 --> 36:52.284
- Yeah, yeah, you can.

36:52.319 --> 36:53.109
Come on.

36:53.683 --> 36:54.550
You can do it.

36:54.585 --> 36:56.244
You can do it, come on.

37:03.495 --> 37:04.296
Okay.

37:07.994 --> 37:09.895
Oh, man's that's a lot of...

37:09.930 --> 37:10.929
- Is that okay?

37:10.964 --> 37:12.062
- Yeah, you got more?

37:12.097 --> 37:12.832
- No.

37:12.867 --> 37:13.833
- Oh wow.

37:13.868 --> 37:16.671
- Where do we put it?

37:16.706 --> 37:17.804
- What?

37:17.839 --> 37:19.938
- Do you have like a bag?

37:21.106 --> 37:22.512
- What?

37:22.547 --> 37:24.910
Oh shit, I don't, I don't.

37:24.945 --> 37:27.319
Do you have
something, like a bag?

37:31.017 --> 37:33.215
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

37:34.020 --> 37:35.690
- Yeah, yeah.

37:35.725 --> 37:36.658
- Awesome.

37:44.371 --> 37:47.306
- That's good, that's
good, good job.

37:48.166 --> 37:49.539
You're doing great.

37:49.574 --> 37:50.441
- Okay.

37:50.476 --> 37:51.343
- Okay.

37:52.335 --> 37:53.136
Okay.

37:55.008 --> 37:55.809
Okay.

37:56.383 --> 37:58.713
Sometimes these things don't...

37:59.881 --> 38:01.111
Just hold it.

38:01.146 --> 38:04.048
- You hold it, you hold
it and I'll zip it.

38:08.351 --> 38:09.361
- Oh.

38:11.090 --> 38:11.891
You got.

38:14.896 --> 38:17.094
- Oh God, okay, thank you.

38:17.998 --> 38:18.997
How's that?

38:20.704 --> 38:21.703
Okay. Good.

38:22.508 --> 38:23.374
How'd I do?

38:24.576 --> 38:27.038
- Work on your penmanship,
it's really...

38:28.107 --> 38:30.547
- Well, you did great.
Thank you.

38:30.582 --> 38:32.241
- Thank you.
- All right.

38:33.013 --> 38:34.815
- Have a good day.

38:40.625 --> 38:41.954
- How'd it go?

38:42.528 --> 38:43.857
- What?

38:43.892 --> 38:44.924
- The audition.

38:44.959 --> 38:46.090
- Oh, oh, oh,

38:47.731 --> 38:49.698
good, I think.

38:49.733 --> 38:51.436
I could have been better
prepared probably,

38:51.471 --> 38:52.734
but I don't know.

38:52.769 --> 38:55.198
You know I tried this
weird speech impediment.

38:56.069 --> 38:57.068
I'm not sure it worked.

38:57.103 --> 38:59.037
But you know, fingers crossed.

38:59.072 --> 39:00.170
And thank you for these.

39:00.205 --> 39:01.072
- Of course.

39:01.107 --> 39:02.942
And I talked a lot about you.

39:02.977 --> 39:04.009
- Thank you.

39:04.044 --> 39:05.142
- Yeah, you're welcome.

39:06.046 --> 39:08.552
So, can I use your bathroom?

39:20.258 --> 39:21.730
Oh my God.

39:21.765 --> 39:24.799
Oh my, fuck yes.

39:44.084 --> 39:45.380
Hey, what do you think?

39:45.415 --> 39:47.756
Pretty good, right?

39:47.791 --> 39:49.021
Hey, you available?

40:06.546 --> 40:09.514
I forgot that I gotta,
I gotta go poop.

40:24.531 --> 40:25.321
Sock.

40:31.164 --> 40:32.834
Yeah baby.

40:34.497 --> 40:35.331
Okay.

40:57.828 --> 40:59.454
- Sir, Sir.

40:59.489 --> 41:00.730
- Yeah.

41:00.765 --> 41:02.864
- We don't scan carry
on on domestic flights.

41:02.899 --> 41:04.426
You can move on through.

41:05.704 --> 41:06.670
- Oh.

41:06.903 --> 41:07.836
- Thank you.

41:07.871 --> 41:08.870
- Thank you.

41:09.576 --> 41:10.707
Okay then.

41:13.580 --> 41:15.811
- <i> Attention</i>
<i>passengers, Flight 492 with</i>

41:15.846 --> 41:19.012
<i>service to Ottawa International</i>
<i>Airport is now boarding.</i>

41:32.896 --> 41:34.225
- Sir, Air-o-plan?

41:36.603 --> 41:38.097
Miss, Air-o-plan?

41:38.132 --> 41:40.000
- Wait another Crown,
please and thanks.

41:40.035 --> 41:41.397
- Right away, Sir.
- Thank you.

41:41.432 --> 41:43.069
- Would you like to sign
up for our Air-o-plan card?

41:43.104 --> 41:44.532
It's a credit card
and air miles in one.

41:44.567 --> 41:45.676
- Air miles?

41:45.711 --> 41:47.271
- It's a frequent
flyer program, Sir.

41:48.945 --> 41:50.241
The more you use the card,

41:50.276 --> 41:51.506
the more points you
get toward flights

41:51.541 --> 41:53.013
and of course cocktails.

41:53.048 --> 41:55.015
- Ooh, who could say no to that?

42:00.220 --> 42:01.549
<i>Arriving passengers,</i>

42:06.765 --> 42:07.566

42:15.136 --> 42:16.234
You're never gonna cut
on me again, right?

42:16.269 --> 42:17.433
- Never, I promise you.

42:17.468 --> 42:19.908
And tomorrow I'm gonna prove it.

42:19.943 --> 42:21.272
- How?

42:21.307 --> 42:23.472
- Well I can't tell you
all my secrets now, can I?

42:23.507 --> 42:24.473
- No.

42:25.443 --> 42:27.586
- Oh, I can't forget this.

42:28.149 --> 42:29.819
- Come on, car's this way.

42:31.416 --> 42:34.758
- My wife's rings,
necklaces and bracelets,

42:35.695 --> 42:37.288
bastard even took my shotgun.

42:38.258 --> 42:40.258
So, where do we go from here?

42:41.426 --> 42:43.800
- Oh, they steal here,
they fence over in Vanier,

42:43.835 --> 42:46.429
they sell at another
county or in the States.

42:46.464 --> 42:48.299
Recovery's low, okay,
it's extremely low.

42:48.334 --> 42:49.938
Okay, it's extremely low.
- It doesn't have to be.

42:50.677 --> 42:53.304
Detective Ray Hoffman,
Vanier B and E.

42:53.339 --> 42:55.141
- That's quite the
super bush cut, buddy.

42:55.176 --> 42:56.439
- Dress for the job you want.

42:56.474 --> 42:58.815
Been trying to get ahold
of you for a few weeks.

42:59.609 --> 43:00.443
- Give me a sec.

43:00.478 --> 43:01.686
- Yeah, sure.

43:01.721 --> 43:02.951
- They said you weren't
much of a desk guy.

43:02.986 --> 43:04.612
So I thought I'd
catch you in action.

43:04.647 --> 43:06.251
Sounds like you guys are
having as much luck as we are.

43:06.286 --> 43:07.824
- Yeah, well they keep
cutting funding

43:07.859 --> 43:09.320
'cause we're not
delivering the numbers.

43:09.355 --> 43:11.454
Getting more pink slips
now than convictions.

43:11.489 --> 43:12.697
Waiting on mine.

43:12.732 --> 43:13.621
How can I help you?

43:13.656 --> 43:15.623
- 8,224 robberies nationwide.

43:15.658 --> 43:17.801
It's the most in
the entire world.

43:17.836 --> 43:20.529
The Capital alone's seen B and
E's double since last annum.

43:20.564 --> 43:21.871
Despite where our
government says,

43:21.906 --> 43:23.169
we're not winning.

43:23.204 --> 43:24.137
- I don't think I've
ever heard anyone

43:24.172 --> 43:25.402
use the word annum out loud.

43:27.241 --> 43:28.273
- It must be equally frustrating

43:28.308 --> 43:29.538
with our overlapping cases

43:29.573 --> 43:31.639
to not have access to
one another's resources.

43:31.674 --> 43:33.311
Same perps moving in
and out of our cities,

43:33.346 --> 43:34.851
same red tape covering
both our departments.

43:34.886 --> 43:36.116
- Understatement.

43:36.151 --> 43:38.151
So what are you saying
you want join forces?

43:38.186 --> 43:39.548
- We'll create a new one.

43:39.583 --> 43:41.220
- Like a task force?

43:41.255 --> 43:43.123
- Look, from what I found,
there's three top fences

43:43.158 --> 43:44.388
for everything stolen,

43:44.423 --> 43:45.521
with the name that keeps
coming across my desk

43:45.556 --> 43:46.324
is Tommy.
- Tommy Kay.

43:46.359 --> 43:47.292
I know, I know.

43:47.327 --> 43:48.227
Down at The Playmate, I know,

43:48.262 --> 43:49.129
even this break-in right here

43:49.164 --> 43:50.702
has got all the Tommy hallmarks,

43:50.737 --> 43:53.738
guns and jewelry stolen and all
the electronics left behind.

43:53.773 --> 43:55.531
- Both have higher resale.
- Yeah.

43:55.566 --> 43:56.840
- By my estimation,

43:56.875 --> 43:58.710
70% of everything stolen
moves through him.

43:58.745 --> 44:00.206
We bring him down
it all falls.

44:00.241 --> 44:01.504
- You you're gonna
need more manpower,

44:01.539 --> 44:04.507
major funding and a
fucking kickass proposal.

44:16.191 --> 44:18.796
- Elwood, I think we just
got our mission from God.

44:19.964 --> 44:21.260
- It's Hoffman.

44:21.295 --> 44:23.097
- No, Elwood, Blues Brothers.

44:23.132 --> 44:24.593
You know, Belushi, Aykroyd...

44:24.628 --> 44:26.661
Okay, we'll work on that.

44:26.696 --> 44:28.872
- It's true.

44:28.907 --> 44:31.369
- This is a nice
neighborhood, right?

44:31.404 --> 44:32.601
- What are you up to?

44:32.636 --> 44:33.338
- What do you mean,
what am I up to?

44:33.373 --> 44:34.339
- Okay.

44:34.374 --> 44:35.714
- We're out for a walk.
- Uh huh.

44:36.706 --> 44:37.881
- Oh, I like this place.

44:39.709 --> 44:41.511
- Whose place is this?

44:41.546 --> 44:43.183
- Ours?

44:43.218 --> 44:43.953
- What?

44:45.418 --> 44:46.615
What?

44:46.650 --> 44:47.715
No.

44:47.750 --> 44:48.760
- Yep.

44:49.895 --> 44:50.652
- Wow.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.768
Yeah, well, come on, we
don't have enough money

44:56.803 --> 44:57.692
to rent this.

44:57.727 --> 44:58.737
- Who says we're renting?

45:00.103 --> 45:00.937
<i>All right,</i>

45:00.972 --> 45:02.202
<i>I know what you're thinking</i>

45:02.237 --> 45:04.138
<i>that new homeowner</i>
<i>smile on my face</i>

45:04.173 --> 45:06.140
<i>is 'cause I must be</i>
<i>rolling in it, right?</i>

45:06.175 --> 45:07.603
<i>Wrong.</i>

45:07.638 --> 45:10.947
<i>The average bank job only</i>
<i>nets you about 20 grand.</i>

45:10.982 --> 45:13.917
<i>You know how fast you</i>
<i>can burn through 20 Gs.</i>

45:13.952 --> 45:16.953
<i>Look no further than</i>
<i>this house right here.</i>

45:16.988 --> 45:20.286
- New baby, new start, amazing
things for an amazing woman.

45:21.157 --> 45:21.925
- Really?
- Yep.

45:21.960 --> 45:23.388
- What, how?

45:23.423 --> 45:26.325
- Well I reconnected
with my Pops out West

45:26.360 --> 45:27.832
and he hired me as a...

45:27.867 --> 45:29.427
Come on in.

45:29.462 --> 45:31.462
He hired me as a
security analyst.

45:31.497 --> 45:32.903
So I'll be flying
back and forth a lot,

45:32.938 --> 45:34.938
but I think it's
worth it, right?

45:34.973 --> 45:36.566
- What exactly are you doing?

45:36.601 --> 45:38.469
- So I'll be going
into businesses

45:38.504 --> 45:40.339
and assessing their weaknesses.

45:40.374 --> 45:44.442
Oh yeah, right over there
boys, thank you, thank you.

45:44.477 --> 45:46.818
Yeah, so I go into
companies and I help them.

45:46.853 --> 45:49.117
I teach them how to, you
know, improve their security,

45:49.152 --> 45:50.778
prevent crime, things like that.

45:50.813 --> 45:51.581
- Really?

45:51.616 --> 45:52.582
- Yeah.

45:52.617 --> 45:54.452
- Well when do I
get to meet him?

45:54.487 --> 45:57.125
- Well, you know, he
doesn't really believe

45:57.160 --> 46:00.326
in the whole living together
before marriage thing.

46:00.361 --> 46:02.097
He thinks we're sinners.

46:02.132 --> 46:03.395
He's kind of a commie that way.

46:04.464 --> 46:06.134
- So when are we
gonna get married?

46:09.172 --> 46:11.436
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

46:12.472 --> 46:13.735
Is this real wood?

46:24.418 --> 46:26.154
- You're very fast when
you look through it.

46:26.189 --> 46:28.486
I mean, 'cause it's a lot
of work went into that.

46:31.029 --> 46:31.896
I'm just saying.

46:34.659 --> 46:35.867
- Definitely well put together.

46:35.902 --> 46:36.791
- It is, it is, yeah.

46:36.826 --> 46:38.199
And, and you know, these guys,

46:38.234 --> 46:39.497
they keep popping up like ants.

46:39.532 --> 46:42.401
So that gives us the
resources that we need

46:42.436 --> 46:44.469
so we can tail them
to their fences.

46:44.504 --> 46:46.174
I mean, we have to
prove the source, right?

46:46.209 --> 46:47.703
- I get that.

46:47.738 --> 46:49.507
It's just, there's not enough
in the budget to fund this.

46:49.542 --> 46:51.047
- We'll cut corners, okay.

46:51.082 --> 46:52.378
We have no issue with that.

46:52.413 --> 46:53.478
- Even then.

46:53.513 --> 46:55.216
- You don't have to
pay us overtime.

46:55.955 --> 46:57.482
It's fine.

46:57.517 --> 47:00.518
- Maybe if we had a bigger
success rate ahead of time,

47:00.553 --> 47:02.586
this would be a lot easier
sell to the boys upstairs.

47:02.621 --> 47:04.522
- That's what's gonna
give us the bigger rate

47:04.557 --> 47:06.491
and make you look even
more like the rock star

47:06.526 --> 47:07.822
than you already are.

47:07.857 --> 47:10.363
Okay, okay, remember why
we got into this, okay.

47:10.398 --> 47:11.496
Let's do that.

47:11.531 --> 47:13.729
And we can only do
that if we do this.

47:15.304 --> 47:16.699
Okay, just pass it on.

47:16.734 --> 47:18.877
They say no, they say no,
I don't bring it up again.

47:21.541 --> 47:26.181
- If I pass this
on, you'll leave?

47:26.216 --> 47:28.117
- Up, up, up, up.

47:28.152 --> 47:29.778
- Promise?
- Promise, see that right there.

47:29.813 --> 47:31.120
- You're gone?
- Fucking rockstar.

47:32.651 --> 47:35.190
- Strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, threats.

58:10.629 --> 58:12.354

- Not a bank.

58:25.908 --> 58:27.303
What do you know about jewelry?

58:29.043 --> 58:30.306
- What do I know about jewelry?

58:31.881 --> 58:35.443
I know that people are attached
to it and it's riskier.

58:35.478 --> 58:37.687
I mean, money is money,
it's got no characteristics,

58:37.722 --> 58:42.021
but diamonds and
watches, that's personal.

58:42.056 --> 58:44.089
- Yeah, which is why
it's more lucrative.

58:45.059 --> 58:47.092
- I don't know.

58:47.127 --> 58:48.896
Jewelry's like taking
from the little guy.

58:48.931 --> 58:50.458
A bank is an institution.

58:50.493 --> 58:52.636

58:56.268 --> 58:57.806

58:57.841 --> 58:59.533
These places are corporate.

58:59.568 --> 59:02.140
They're smaller than
banks, less security.

59:02.175 --> 59:05.748
You do one job like that
right, you can retire.

59:05.783 --> 59:07.145
You should think about it.

59:09.182 --> 59:11.446

59:34.438 --> 59:35.404

- I'm not
even gonna ask.

1:00:00.530 --> 1:00:02.035
- I can tweak the report,

1:00:02.070 --> 1:00:03.300
lower the numbers,
make it a budget

1:00:03.335 --> 1:00:04.202
they can get on board with.

1:00:04.237 --> 1:00:05.137
- No point.

1:00:05.172 --> 1:00:06.644
- So that's it, we just quit?

1:00:13.246 --> 1:00:14.718
We got it?

1:00:14.753 --> 1:00:16.214
- Oh, I mean, unless approved
means something else.

1:00:17.547 --> 1:00:18.986
Look, I know I'm a
bastard, all right.

1:00:19.021 --> 1:00:20.614
All right, look, I'm
gonna need 20K cash

1:00:20.649 --> 1:00:22.055
so we can get all the
fence shit we need.

1:00:22.090 --> 1:00:23.694
I want every single
one of our boys

1:00:23.729 --> 1:00:25.157
in unmarked rent-a-wrecks

1:00:25.192 --> 1:00:28.160
and a big fucking state of
the art home base.

1:00:33.068 --> 1:00:36.036
Well, I guess it beats the
shitbox coffee shops, huh?

1:00:36.071 --> 1:00:37.466
So what are we calling it?

1:00:48.413 --> 1:00:51.755
- OPD, RCMP, all top
of their class.

1:00:51.790 --> 1:00:53.614
Can I get everyone's
attention please?

1:00:54.518 --> 1:00:55.418
- Hi guys, how you doing?

1:00:55.453 --> 1:00:57.024
I'm Detective Snydes, B and E,

1:00:57.059 --> 1:01:00.192
I'm not gonna give a big speech
or your game day pep talk.

1:01:00.227 --> 1:01:04.592
But the fact is Project Cafe
is your number one priority.

1:01:04.627 --> 1:01:06.693
Individually, you don't matter.

1:01:06.728 --> 1:01:08.398
Your families no longer matter.

1:01:08.433 --> 1:01:10.598
But know that if
we catch our man,

1:01:10.633 --> 1:01:12.237
every single one
of you goes home

1:01:12.272 --> 1:01:13.502
with credit for the collar.

1:01:13.537 --> 1:01:14.668
Understood?

1:01:14.703 --> 1:01:16.241
Any questions?

1:01:16.276 --> 1:01:18.375
- Who exactly are we
trying to collar, Sir?

1:01:18.410 --> 1:01:19.673
- Tommy Kay.

1:01:19.708 --> 1:01:21.576
Moves more goods
than fucking Simpson Sears

1:01:21.611 --> 1:01:22.643
down at The Playmate.

1:01:23.613 --> 1:01:25.250
Half the clientele
being on his payroll

1:01:25.285 --> 1:01:27.252
makes that place
fingerprint city.

1:01:27.287 --> 1:01:29.551
I wanna know every person,
perp and prostitute

1:01:29.586 --> 1:01:31.861
that goes in and
outta that place.

1:01:34.459 --> 1:01:35.766
We know Tommy.

1:01:35.801 --> 1:01:37.691
Diamond Dave, his
second in command.

1:01:43.402 --> 1:01:46.007
Billy Bishop, junkie
all around shit heel.

1:01:47.670 --> 1:01:49.505
But the last two
pieces of the puzzle,

1:01:51.311 --> 1:01:52.508
what do we have on them?

1:01:53.445 --> 1:01:54.213
- Working on it.

1:01:54.248 --> 1:01:55.478
- Well, work harder.

1:01:55.513 --> 1:01:57.051
Get me everything
you can on these two.

1:01:57.086 --> 1:01:58.448
Because ever since
they showed up,

1:01:58.483 --> 1:02:00.252
we're seeing a lot less
fencing going on down there.

1:02:00.287 --> 1:02:01.550
And I wanna know if
they got something to do

1:02:01.585 --> 1:02:02.958
with all these bank
jobs going down.

1:02:02.993 --> 1:02:04.355
'Cause it's no coincidence.

1:02:13.696 --> 1:02:14.970
- Oh shit.

1:02:15.005 --> 1:02:16.972
- Yeah, all right,
I asked around.

1:02:17.007 --> 1:02:20.107
Security analysts don't make
this kind of cash, Robert.

1:02:21.770 --> 1:02:23.077
- Well, the good ones do.

1:02:23.112 --> 1:02:25.244
- Yeah, what about
your business card?

1:02:25.279 --> 1:02:26.608
The telephone line
is disconnected

1:02:26.643 --> 1:02:28.577
and the address
doesn't even exist.

1:02:28.612 --> 1:02:30.150
What are you doing?

1:02:32.220 --> 1:02:33.252
- Look.

1:02:33.287 --> 1:02:34.957
- Are you selling drugs?

1:02:34.992 --> 1:02:35.859
- No.

1:02:35.894 --> 1:02:37.190
- Are you killing people?

1:02:37.225 --> 1:02:39.357
- No, of course I'm
not killing people.

1:02:39.392 --> 1:02:41.392
- Well, I'm running
out of options here.

1:02:45.904 --> 1:02:47.629
Are you even working
with your dad?

1:02:50.007 --> 1:02:52.469
- My dad's been in the can
since I was 10-years-old.

1:02:54.242 --> 1:02:55.670
The last time I saw him,

1:02:55.705 --> 1:02:58.211
he was getting dragged off
the front lawn in handcuffs.

1:02:58.246 --> 1:03:00.444
I didn't tell you because
I was embarrassed.

1:03:00.479 --> 1:03:01.808
- And what about your mom?

1:03:01.843 --> 1:03:04.052
All that stuff about your mom,
was that a lie too?

1:03:04.087 --> 1:03:04.855
- No.

1:03:06.848 --> 1:03:10.586
No, no, that's the truth.

1:03:13.261 --> 1:03:15.558
Before my mom left, she would
sit with me and my brother

1:03:15.593 --> 1:03:16.867
and she would just read to us.

1:03:16.902 --> 1:03:18.693
She was really big on
that kind of stuff.

1:03:18.728 --> 1:03:19.870
She was super smart.

1:03:21.071 --> 1:03:22.697
Then after my dad
got locked up, she,

1:03:25.240 --> 1:03:26.503
I don't know, she
just checked out

1:03:26.538 --> 1:03:29.946
and she wasn't really
around much anymore.

1:03:31.873 --> 1:03:33.246
She'd always say that,

1:03:33.281 --> 1:03:35.017
no matter how much I changed
my clothes or my shirt,

1:03:35.052 --> 1:03:38.383
I would always,
I'd always be him.

1:03:39.958 --> 1:03:42.255
- Then what the
hell is going on?

1:03:42.290 --> 1:03:43.619
What are you doing?

1:03:48.725 --> 1:03:49.790
- Page one.

1:03:53.268 --> 1:03:54.905
You're inside trading?

1:03:56.766 --> 1:03:57.765
- Lower on the page.

1:04:01.276 --> 1:04:03.408
Look, after I got
outta jail, I met you

1:04:04.477 --> 1:04:05.509
and I wanted to start over.

1:04:05.544 --> 1:04:07.412
I wanted a home,
I wanted a family.

1:04:09.218 --> 1:04:09.953
That's it.

1:04:11.088 --> 1:04:11.889
I'm sorry.

1:04:14.322 --> 1:04:15.123
- This is you.

1:04:16.456 --> 1:04:17.488
- Yeah.

1:04:18.260 --> 1:04:19.292
- You're a robber?

1:04:20.493 --> 1:04:21.294
- Yeah.

1:04:22.792 --> 1:04:24.099
- How many have you done?

1:04:25.432 --> 1:04:29.467
- I don't know, maybe
30 newspapers worth.

1:04:31.273 --> 1:04:32.074
- 30?

1:04:33.836 --> 1:04:34.802
- Maybe more.

1:04:37.180 --> 1:04:40.412
Look nobody's been
hurt, except you.

1:04:42.581 --> 1:04:44.713
I'm gonna pack up my shit
and I'll be out by tonight.

1:04:44.748 --> 1:04:45.516
I promise.

1:04:46.651 --> 1:04:49.751
- So you're just
robbing the banksters?

1:04:53.493 --> 1:04:54.591
- Yeah.

1:04:57.629 --> 1:04:58.430
- Show me.

1:05:11.940 --> 1:05:13.379
So what are we looking for?

1:05:14.382 --> 1:05:19.319
- Strengths, weaknesses,
opportunities, threats.

1:05:19.651 --> 1:05:21.684
See if I can get in and
out of there in a minute 30

1:05:21.719 --> 1:05:23.488
and not get caught in the
first three minutes after,

1:05:23.523 --> 1:05:25.061
I'll always get away.

1:05:26.526 --> 1:05:27.525
Oh, there he is.

1:05:32.631 --> 1:05:34.433
I love this guy.

1:05:34.468 --> 1:05:35.467
Look at him.

1:05:36.470 --> 1:05:37.667
So horny.

1:05:37.702 --> 1:05:38.635
Look at him.

1:05:38.670 --> 1:05:39.933
- You've been here before.

1:05:39.968 --> 1:05:40.703
- Yeah.

1:05:40.738 --> 1:05:42.078
Yeah, but only on recon.

1:05:45.083 --> 1:05:46.709
- So he's the weakness?

1:05:46.744 --> 1:05:48.381
- And the opportunity.

1:05:49.318 --> 1:05:50.218
- Wait, you're going now?

1:05:50.253 --> 1:05:51.285
- Yep.

1:05:51.320 --> 1:05:52.946
- Wait, you're leaving.
Oh my God.

1:05:52.981 --> 1:05:54.552
- Wish me luck.
- What?

1:05:57.557 --> 1:05:58.721
Oh my God.

1:05:59.526 --> 1:06:00.228
Okay.

1:06:29.589 --> 1:06:32.161
- Hey man, you're Carl?

1:06:32.196 --> 1:06:33.228
- I'm Carl.

1:06:33.263 --> 1:06:36.099
- No, oh my God.

1:06:36.134 --> 1:06:38.563
- Oh, did you drive
the plymouth?

1:06:38.598 --> 1:06:39.498
-Yeah.

1:06:39.533 --> 1:06:41.599
I just saw somebody over there,

1:06:41.634 --> 1:06:43.073
looks like they were trying
to jimmy something in there.

1:06:43.108 --> 1:06:44.272
- You kidding me?

1:06:44.307 --> 1:06:46.274
- Yeah, looked like it
might be a burglary.

1:07:58.315 --> 1:07:59.776
- Where are you?

1:08:09.051 --> 1:08:10.655
- Wait,

1:08:10.690 --> 1:08:12.085
what the hell?

1:08:16.201 --> 1:08:17.090
Oh no.

1:08:24.374 --> 1:08:25.901
Oh my God.

1:08:38.146 --> 1:08:39.321
Oh my God.

1:08:50.895 --> 1:08:51.927
Is he talking to me?

1:08:56.703 --> 1:08:57.636
Oh my God.

1:08:57.671 --> 1:08:58.703
Oh my God.

1:09:04.612 --> 1:09:05.809
What?

1:09:05.844 --> 1:09:06.975
What?

1:09:07.010 --> 1:09:08.317
Oh my God.

1:09:09.683 --> 1:09:10.715
Are you okay?

1:09:10.750 --> 1:09:12.079
- Yeah.

1:09:12.114 --> 1:09:13.355
You know, it's always a
bit of an adrenaline rush,

1:09:13.390 --> 1:09:15.082
but other than that, it's good.

1:09:15.117 --> 1:09:17.755
- There was so much going on,
I didn't know where you were.

1:09:17.790 --> 1:09:19.053
- That means I did my job.

1:09:19.088 --> 1:09:21.022
Look at that.
Look at that.

1:09:22.861 --> 1:09:24.058
- This is wild.

1:09:24.093 --> 1:09:25.532
- Yeah, I know baby.

1:09:25.567 --> 1:09:28.568
Look, I know, I know it's a
lot, but hopefully,

1:09:28.603 --> 1:09:29.899
you know, we can get through.

1:09:43.981 --> 1:09:45.816
What are you thinking?

1:09:47.787 --> 1:09:48.918
- You gotta promise
me something.

1:09:48.953 --> 1:09:50.788
Actually, a couple of things.

1:09:50.823 --> 1:09:51.624
- Okay.

1:09:52.957 --> 1:09:54.726
- One, you never get caught.

1:09:55.762 --> 1:09:56.794
- Of course.

1:09:56.829 --> 1:09:59.566
- Two, you just rob banks.

1:09:59.601 --> 1:10:02.030
I mean, they've screwed over
everyone I've ever cared about.

1:10:02.065 --> 1:10:03.636
So I can live with that.

1:10:06.509 --> 1:10:07.277
- Sure.

1:10:08.511 --> 1:10:09.312
What else?

1:10:10.645 --> 1:10:12.645
- You do this until
we can retire.

1:10:12.680 --> 1:10:16.484
And we take the baby, you
get that beach bar of yours

1:10:16.519 --> 1:10:20.653
and we move on a hundred
percent legit, you're done.

1:10:24.153 --> 1:10:24.921
- Deal.

1:10:35.472 --> 1:10:39.507
Actually, you gotta
promise me something first?

1:10:40.840 --> 1:10:41.971
- Oh yeah, what's that?

1:10:58.022 --> 1:10:59.120
- Will you marry me?

1:11:00.629 --> 1:11:01.397
- Robert.

1:11:03.797 --> 1:11:05.126
Oh my God.

1:11:05.161 --> 1:11:06.567
- Is that a yes?

1:11:08.065 --> 1:11:08.866
- Yes.

1:11:09.704 --> 1:11:11.297
Oh my God.

1:11:16.678 --> 1:11:19.074
- All right, the last
two guys, we need to ID.

1:11:25.346 --> 1:11:26.488
- Still nothing on him, huh?

1:11:26.523 --> 1:11:27.390
Not a thing?

1:11:27.425 --> 1:11:28.754
- Not a thing, he's a ghost.

1:11:29.856 --> 1:11:31.790
- What about the
other guy, anything?

1:11:31.825 --> 1:11:33.495
- Didn't he drive the same car?

1:11:33.530 --> 1:11:34.694
- Yeah, they all do.

1:11:34.729 --> 1:11:35.860
They're like a Chrysler
Fifth Avenue gang.

1:11:35.895 --> 1:11:37.400
Tommy and Dave have one too.

1:11:38.667 --> 1:11:41.195
- The other guy drove the
same exact car, same plates.

1:11:41.230 --> 1:11:42.900
Registered to an Andrea Hudson.

1:11:44.101 --> 1:11:45.265
What's the explanation?

1:11:47.544 --> 1:11:48.774
- I think I'm gonna find out.

1:11:58.379 --> 1:11:59.818
- Someone's had a few.

1:11:59.853 --> 1:12:02.084
- Oh, hey, why you say that?

1:12:02.119 --> 1:12:03.558
- You're still in disguise.

1:12:05.628 --> 1:12:07.188
- Oh shit.

1:12:08.257 --> 1:12:09.465
- Don't get sloppy kid.

1:12:11.733 --> 1:12:13.260
- Yeah, you know, I hear you.

1:12:13.295 --> 1:12:15.229
But to be honest, I've
just been focusing

1:12:15.264 --> 1:12:16.604
on that one last job.

1:12:17.640 --> 1:12:18.903
That's our big one.

1:12:18.938 --> 1:12:21.444
Then I'm gonna be owning
a place just like this,

1:12:21.479 --> 1:12:22.907
but ocean side.

1:12:22.942 --> 1:12:24.909
- Got it figured out yet?

1:12:24.944 --> 1:12:27.010
- Not quite, not
quite, but I have been

1:12:27.045 --> 1:12:29.947
casing out a place out
West the last few months.

1:12:29.982 --> 1:12:31.553
You know, this is the big one.

1:12:32.886 --> 1:12:34.952
I'm calling it
The Big Vancouver.

1:12:34.987 --> 1:12:36.888
- Oh, you're naming
your jobs now.

1:12:36.923 --> 1:12:38.560
- Yeah, Robert would
have trading cards

1:12:38.595 --> 1:12:40.287
with his stats on
it if he could.

1:12:40.322 --> 1:12:42.025
- That is actually
a really good idea.

1:12:42.060 --> 1:12:43.389
- Yeah.

1:12:43.424 --> 1:12:46.436
Bigger job, you know, you're
gonna need a second man.

1:12:46.471 --> 1:12:47.899
- No, I don't need
a second man.

1:12:47.934 --> 1:12:49.736
- Yeah, what about Bishop?

1:12:49.771 --> 1:12:50.506
- Come on.

1:12:51.806 --> 1:12:52.871
That guy, no.
- Yeah.

1:12:52.906 --> 1:12:54.202
Come on, he's a good man.

1:12:54.237 --> 1:12:57.106
- Yeah, no, definitely
don't need a second man.

1:12:57.141 --> 1:12:58.877
- Come on, I got an
investment to protect.

1:12:58.912 --> 1:12:59.779
You get a second pair of eyes.

1:12:59.814 --> 1:13:01.550
- I don't need a second man.

1:13:01.585 --> 1:13:03.409
- Robert, I insist.

1:13:05.820 --> 1:13:07.149
- Okay, you know what?

1:13:07.184 --> 1:13:09.492
I can talk about this
some other time, okay.

1:13:10.418 --> 1:13:12.891
Right now I gotta
get back to the wife.

1:13:12.926 --> 1:13:13.925
- You got a wife?

1:13:13.960 --> 1:13:17.258
- Yeah, well fiance technically.

1:13:17.293 --> 1:13:18.996
Yeah, I've had the ring
the last couple of months,

1:13:19.031 --> 1:13:21.229
but I just decided
now was the time.

1:13:21.264 --> 1:13:23.165
- Well hell congratulations kid.

1:13:23.200 --> 1:13:23.968
- Thank you.

1:13:24.003 --> 1:13:26.938
- Hey, to Partner's rye

1:13:26.973 --> 1:13:27.741
and your fiance.

1:13:27.776 --> 1:13:29.578
- And my baby to be.

1:13:29.613 --> 1:13:30.843
- It's package deal.

1:13:30.878 --> 1:13:31.811
Double fledge.

1:13:32.979 --> 1:13:34.011
- Well, how about that?

1:13:34.046 --> 1:13:35.408
- All right, I'm
gonna take a piss

1:13:35.443 --> 1:13:37.311
and get outta here
before she has my nuts.

1:13:37.346 --> 1:13:38.818
- Okay.

1:13:38.853 --> 1:13:40.985
- Oh and,
got something for you.

1:13:41.020 --> 1:13:42.316
- What the hell's that?

1:13:42.351 --> 1:13:43.823
- "Karma Chameleon"
is track one.

1:13:43.858 --> 1:13:44.857
- Huh?

1:13:45.794 --> 1:13:46.958
- MTV baby.

1:13:46.993 --> 1:13:48.828
- Oh, it's this George Boy guy.

1:13:48.863 --> 1:13:50.291
He's fucking everywhere.

1:13:50.326 --> 1:13:51.864
What the fuck is with that?

1:13:54.066 --> 1:13:56.836
Hey Detective, you finally here
to throw down that warrant?

1:13:56.871 --> 1:13:59.102
- Nah, no, just
a deuce T bag.

1:13:59.137 --> 1:14:00.708
- Well, you must
really like this place.

1:14:00.743 --> 1:14:03.612
- The only thing I'll ever
like about this place

1:14:03.647 --> 1:14:05.878
is the look on your face
when I shut it down.

1:14:05.913 --> 1:14:07.044
And that's just
a matter of time.

1:14:07.079 --> 1:14:08.947
- Oh, time's a funny thing.

1:14:08.982 --> 1:14:11.048
Let it run long enough,
warrants expire,

1:14:11.083 --> 1:14:13.985
funding dries up,
people get hurt.

1:14:18.992 --> 1:14:19.991
- I'll light a match for you.

1:14:20.026 --> 1:14:21.025
- Yeah.

1:14:21.060 --> 1:14:21.861
Choke a loaf.

1:14:38.539 --> 1:14:39.648
- Oh hey.

1:14:39.683 --> 1:14:41.243
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:14:50.287 --> 1:14:51.418
- Boy George fan, huh?

1:14:52.729 --> 1:14:54.421
- Yeah, yeah.

1:14:54.456 --> 1:14:55.488
I am.

1:14:55.523 --> 1:14:56.324
You know, I think
he's underrated.

1:14:56.359 --> 1:14:57.325
- Yeah.
- I like him.

1:14:57.360 --> 1:14:58.931
Yeah.
- Oh wow, too much makeup.

1:14:58.966 --> 1:15:00.361
Even for me,

1:15:00.396 --> 1:15:01.901
everyone thinks I got
fucking eyeliner on you know.

1:15:03.366 --> 1:15:04.574
- Yeah.

1:15:04.609 --> 1:15:06.202
It looks like you're
wearing eyeliner.

1:15:06.237 --> 1:15:07.005
You're not?

1:15:07.040 --> 1:15:08.941
- No, no.
- Oh.

1:15:08.976 --> 1:15:09.843
- Be who you are, you know.

1:15:09.878 --> 1:15:10.778
- Yeah, yep.

1:15:10.813 --> 1:15:12.076
Okay, sure.

1:15:12.111 --> 1:15:13.143
You take care.

1:15:13.981 --> 1:15:14.881
Bye, bye.

1:15:14.916 --> 1:15:16.949
- Hey, "Changing Every Day"

1:15:16.984 --> 1:15:18.478
that's on that album too, right?

1:15:19.547 --> 1:15:21.690
- I think so.
I think so.

1:15:21.725 --> 1:15:23.384
- Yeah, what do you think
he's trying to hide?

1:15:24.090 --> 1:15:25.353
- I don't know, man.

1:15:25.388 --> 1:15:27.762
I'm more into the
tune than the lyric.

1:15:27.797 --> 1:15:28.554
You know what I mean?

1:15:28.589 --> 1:15:29.357
- Yeah.

1:15:29.392 --> 1:15:30.160
- Catchy.

1:15:32.065 --> 1:15:33.735
Okay then we'll see you.

1:15:33.770 --> 1:15:34.571
- Yeah.

1:15:37.565 --> 1:15:40.808
Fuck me. Jesus Christ.

1:15:48.147 --> 1:15:49.817
Those two guys drive
the exact same car

1:15:49.852 --> 1:15:51.588
because they're
the exact same guy.

1:15:53.119 --> 1:15:55.625
He's wearing disguise, he's
got fake skin and the wig

1:15:55.660 --> 1:15:56.483
and the whole thing.

1:15:56.518 --> 1:15:57.154
- Why?

1:15:57.189 --> 1:15:58.386
- I don't know why.

1:15:58.421 --> 1:15:59.761
- Well let's run his
plates in and find out.

1:15:59.796 --> 1:16:00.960
- Yeah and call every costume
and prosthetics place,

1:16:00.995 --> 1:16:02.258
coast to coast.

1:16:07.595 --> 1:16:09.837
- John, seriously.

1:16:09.872 --> 1:16:11.003
- Sorry, honey.

1:16:17.374 --> 1:16:18.175
Yeah.

1:16:20.850 --> 1:16:22.179
Better be good.

1:16:22.214 --> 1:16:24.148
- District's been keeping
tabs on various people,

1:16:24.183 --> 1:16:24.984
various vehicles over
the last few months.

1:16:25.019 --> 1:16:26.348
- I know.

1:16:26.383 --> 1:16:28.251
- One of our guys was
heading back to the precinct

1:16:28.286 --> 1:16:29.791
past the 7-Eleven, an
old Buick was there,

1:16:29.826 --> 1:16:31.122
but they didn't
think much of it,

1:16:31.157 --> 1:16:32.662
but they thought
they'd seen it before.

1:16:32.697 --> 1:16:34.092
Couldn't quite shake
this feeling that maybe.

1:16:34.127 --> 1:16:35.423
- Okay if there's a point,
now's the time get to it.

1:16:35.458 --> 1:16:36.765
- Right, right, well
it turns out the car

1:16:36.800 --> 1:16:38.998
belongs to somebody that
we brought in for a DUI,

1:16:39.033 --> 1:16:40.164
then a failure to
appear in court.

1:16:40.199 --> 1:16:41.198
- Okay, he's screwed, I get it.

1:16:41.233 --> 1:16:42.166
Why am I here?

1:16:42.201 --> 1:16:43.673
- He wanted to talk to you.

1:16:57.051 --> 1:16:57.819
- Hey.

1:16:57.854 --> 1:16:59.150
Hey,

1:16:59.185 --> 1:17:00.547
our two guys are not
only the same guy

1:17:00.582 --> 1:17:02.021
I saw at The Playmate.

1:17:02.056 --> 1:17:03.022
He's also this guy.

1:17:04.223 --> 1:17:04.991
- That's Robert?

1:17:05.026 --> 1:17:06.289
- Yes, that's Robert.

1:17:06.324 --> 1:17:08.126
Diamond Dave says he's
off on a job right now.

1:17:08.161 --> 1:17:09.963
Something Robert's
calling The Big Vancouver.

1:17:09.998 --> 1:17:11.228
- He's naming his jobs now.

1:17:11.263 --> 1:17:12.900
- What do we have left
in petty cash quick?

1:17:12.935 --> 1:17:14.396
Oh, come on.

1:17:14.431 --> 1:17:16.233
I've got maybe 50 left in my
account for a plane ticket.

1:17:16.268 --> 1:17:18.466
Come on cough it up.
- All right, all right, here.

1:17:30.414 --> 1:17:31.446
- Are you okay?

1:17:33.890 --> 1:17:35.186
- I need a bump.

1:17:35.221 --> 1:17:36.121
- Oh my God.

1:17:38.125 --> 1:17:40.389
The job is a bigger rush, okay.

1:17:42.129 --> 1:17:43.590
Are you sure you're
okay to do this?

1:17:43.625 --> 1:17:45.262
- You sure it'll work?

1:17:47.266 --> 1:17:49.035
- I know what the
fuck I'm doing.

1:17:49.070 --> 1:17:51.202
You need to keep
your shit together.

1:17:51.237 --> 1:17:52.874
I've cased this
place three times.

1:17:52.909 --> 1:17:55.404
And if it's done right, we'll
clear over a million in there.

1:17:55.439 --> 1:17:58.077
Everything before
this was prologue.

1:18:00.246 --> 1:18:01.751
What the fuck is prologue?

1:18:05.746 --> 1:18:07.086
- So just take a
look at these, ready?

1:18:07.121 --> 1:18:08.791
So this is definitely him?

1:18:08.826 --> 1:18:10.617
- Look, like I said on
the phone from your fax,

1:18:10.652 --> 1:18:12.355
definitely him.
- Okay.

1:18:12.390 --> 1:18:13.620
- And you said
something about money.

1:18:13.655 --> 1:18:15.127
- Has he been back this week?

1:18:15.162 --> 1:18:17.360
- Well, he came by asking
about hiring actors.

1:18:17.395 --> 1:18:18.900
- For what?

1:18:18.935 --> 1:18:20.935
- I don't know, said he wanted
to try something different.

1:18:20.970 --> 1:18:22.002
Maybe directing.

1:18:23.236 --> 1:18:24.631
- Yeah, I'm gonna
guess it's not that.

1:18:27.977 --> 1:18:29.042
- Hey, you
can't go in there.

1:18:29.077 --> 1:18:30.241
- Call Detective
Hoffman it's fine.

1:18:30.276 --> 1:18:31.374
Seriously it's fine.

1:18:31.409 --> 1:18:33.409
Detective John F
Snydes, my guy's already

1:18:33.444 --> 1:18:35.411
gotten the horn with
your team, please.

1:18:36.183 --> 1:18:37.281
- It's all right.

1:18:38.988 --> 1:18:41.252
- I believe this man
has come to your city

1:18:41.287 --> 1:18:44.156
to rob a bank within
the next 24 hours.

1:18:44.191 --> 1:18:47.093
How fast can you get uniforms
to sit on those locations?

1:18:48.162 --> 1:18:50.294
- There's over 670
banks downtown.

1:18:50.329 --> 1:18:52.230
- Well, the same place's
get robbed each time

1:18:52.265 --> 1:18:53.836
he flies into any town.

1:18:53.871 --> 1:18:55.431
And I've narrowed
it down to five.

1:18:55.466 --> 1:18:57.004
He's done two in a day.

1:18:57.039 --> 1:18:59.171
Maybe he's gonna up his
personal best, I don't know.

1:19:01.175 --> 1:19:02.911
Can you help or not?

1:19:20.227 --> 1:19:22.260
Anybody got eyes on anything?

1:19:22.295 --> 1:19:24.163
- No, I got nothing.

1:19:24.198 --> 1:19:25.461
- Negative.

1:19:30.974 --> 1:19:32.303
- Okay, we're all
looking for something

1:19:32.338 --> 1:19:33.634
big and different, right?

1:19:34.879 --> 1:19:35.735
Big and different.

1:19:56.065 --> 1:19:56.822
- Thank you.

1:19:56.857 --> 1:19:57.691
- Take care.

1:20:05.272 --> 1:20:06.733
- Well, that should do her.

1:20:16.250 --> 1:20:18.888
- Hi, what is this?

1:20:18.923 --> 1:20:20.318
- Four palms for delivery.

1:20:20.353 --> 1:20:22.089
- You can't
put those here.

1:20:22.124 --> 1:20:23.387
- Why not?

1:20:23.422 --> 1:20:24.718
- Because we didn't order them.

1:20:24.753 --> 1:20:25.994
- Somebody
ordered 'em.

1:20:26.029 --> 1:20:28.293
- We got anybody
posted at the mall?

1:20:30.429 --> 1:20:32.396
- I just put 'em
where they told me to go.

1:20:32.431 --> 1:20:33.397
- Okay, but.

1:20:42.606 --> 1:20:45.310
- Let's see, I think I'll
take one of everything.

1:20:47.050 --> 1:20:47.774
- No.

1:20:49.745 --> 1:20:50.480
- No?

1:20:55.487 --> 1:20:56.486
- No.

1:20:58.622 --> 1:20:59.995
- Jesus Christ.
- Open up.

1:21:01.295 --> 1:21:02.393
- Are you serious?

1:21:03.330 --> 1:21:04.560
- Anyone else seeing this?

1:21:04.595 --> 1:21:05.792
- Yeah, someone
ordered them, sure.

1:21:05.827 --> 1:21:06.859
I did not.

1:21:06.894 --> 1:21:08.366
- This
is Godwins right?

1:21:08.401 --> 1:21:10.071
- That's what the sign
says, yes, this is Godwins.

1:21:10.106 --> 1:21:12.172
- Well then they're
in the right place.

1:21:12.801 --> 1:21:14.801
- Do me a favor,
run the plates on that van.

1:21:16.310 --> 1:21:18.343
- Hey, handle him.

1:21:22.514 --> 1:21:24.118
God dammit.

1:21:24.153 --> 1:21:25.955
Okay, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

1:21:25.990 --> 1:21:28.419
- Your demeanor's
incredibly unprofessional.

1:21:29.323 --> 1:21:30.993
- Hey you, get on the ground.

1:21:31.028 --> 1:21:32.324
Get the fuck on the ground.

1:21:32.359 --> 1:21:33.919
Get on the ground now.

1:21:33.954 --> 1:21:36.493
- Hey, settle down.

1:21:36.528 --> 1:21:37.494
Easy.

1:21:38.530 --> 1:21:40.970
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1:21:43.601 --> 1:21:45.469
Watch the front door.

1:22:03.324 --> 1:22:04.455
There you go.

1:22:04.490 --> 1:22:06.996
All of it, all it,
all of it, all of it.

1:22:09.165 --> 1:22:11.968
- Robert, I think
we got company.

1:22:14.170 --> 1:22:15.565
- Get over here.

1:22:17.305 --> 1:22:19.206
- You said my name, idiot.

1:22:27.007 --> 1:22:28.842
You did great.

1:22:45.267 --> 1:22:46.530
- Fuck, he's not robbing a bank.

1:22:46.565 --> 1:22:47.993
He's hit the
Godwins at the mall.

1:22:53.110 --> 1:22:54.439
Where'd he go?
Where'd he go?

1:23:00.612 --> 1:23:02.876
- Slow down, don't run.

1:23:02.911 --> 1:23:04.548
Be cool.

1:23:06.915 --> 1:23:07.881
Hey.

1:23:22.139 --> 1:23:22.929
- Hey.

1:23:27.606 --> 1:23:29.210
- I got two possible suspects,

1:23:29.245 --> 1:23:30.541
moving north through the mall.

1:23:30.576 --> 1:23:31.410
Blue coveralls.

1:23:31.445 --> 1:23:32.774
Don't move!

1:23:35.152 --> 1:23:36.679
Hands up, turn around.

1:23:42.082 --> 1:23:43.719
- Snydes,
yeah, I think I see 'em

1:23:43.754 --> 1:23:45.292
other side of the mall.

1:23:46.163 --> 1:23:46.953
- Get outta here..

1:23:48.561 --> 1:23:49.758
- I got 'em.

1:23:49.793 --> 1:23:51.232
Yeah, they're heading
to the West entrance.

1:23:52.092 --> 1:23:54.466
- No, no, no, I got
two over here heading East.

1:23:56.932 --> 1:23:59.504
- Shit.
Do we take them all?

1:24:04.071 --> 1:24:06.280
- Go after the two
that don't run.

1:24:28.865 --> 1:24:29.864
-Go. Let's go.

1:24:33.507 --> 1:24:34.275
Oh shit.

1:24:40.481 --> 1:24:41.612
Check that door.

1:24:41.647 --> 1:24:43.845
- Fuck, I fucked up,
I said your name.

1:24:43.880 --> 1:24:46.617
- Just shut up and
deal with the door.

1:24:59.203 --> 1:25:00.532
- Shit.

1:25:00.567 --> 1:25:01.764
- What?

1:25:01.799 --> 1:25:03.700
- I forgot the gun.

1:25:03.735 --> 1:25:04.536
- What?

1:25:05.506 --> 1:25:06.505
You did what?

1:25:07.541 --> 1:25:08.804
- I must have left
it in the store.

1:25:08.839 --> 1:25:11.004
We were moving so fast,
I panicked.

1:25:11.039 --> 1:25:13.182
- What is wrong with you, dude?

1:25:13.217 --> 1:25:14.480
- Time's up Robert.

1:25:18.651 --> 1:25:19.716
Time's up.

1:25:27.231 --> 1:25:29.264
- You shoot me, you
don't recover anything.

1:25:30.058 --> 1:25:31.695
You still need evidence.

1:25:31.730 --> 1:25:34.203
- Well, you're kind
of exhibit A buddy.

1:25:34.238 --> 1:25:37.734
- No, no, you and I both know

1:25:37.769 --> 1:25:39.703
that you don't have
enough to hold me.

1:25:42.004 --> 1:25:43.575
- No, don't do it.

1:25:43.610 --> 1:25:45.137
- Hey, let's pick
this up another time.

1:25:45.172 --> 1:25:46.974
- Hey, don't, don't.

1:25:47.009 --> 1:25:48.547
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:25:51.354 --> 1:25:52.683
- Hey dumb ass.

1:25:54.522 --> 1:25:55.356
- Fuck.

1:26:02.090 --> 1:26:02.891
- Shit.

1:26:13.101 --> 1:26:14.408
- Hello.

1:26:14.443 --> 1:26:15.739
- Pack your bags, baby.

1:26:16.775 --> 1:26:18.005
- For real?

1:26:18.040 --> 1:26:19.248
- For real.

1:26:19.283 --> 1:26:20.810
Check the top dresser drawer.

1:26:22.814 --> 1:26:23.879
- No.

1:26:26.081 --> 1:26:26.915
- All right, all right.

1:26:26.950 --> 1:26:27.949
I gotta go, I'll see you.

1:26:27.984 --> 1:26:29.049
Don't forget to
pack your sandals.

1:26:29.084 --> 1:26:30.017
<i>- I gotta go.</i>

1:26:30.052 --> 1:26:31.425
- Okay, okay, bye.

1:26:34.793 --> 1:26:36.727
- Cops will see we
bought plane tickets.

1:26:36.762 --> 1:26:37.860
They're all over the airport.

1:26:37.895 --> 1:26:38.795
- Which is why we're
taking the train.

1:26:38.830 --> 1:26:39.730
Take that.

1:26:39.765 --> 1:26:40.962
I'll be in the bar car,

1:26:40.997 --> 1:26:42.403
you make sure you're
somewhere else.

1:26:42.438 --> 1:26:43.239
See ya.

1:26:58.817 --> 1:27:01.620
Goddess, movers
are on their way,

1:27:01.655 --> 1:27:02.819
we gotta go now.

1:27:05.692 --> 1:27:06.757
Andy.

1:27:19.167 --> 1:27:20.606
- We definitely have to go.

1:27:24.810 --> 1:27:26.106
- Babe.

1:27:30.277 --> 1:27:31.144
- I got it.

1:27:31.179 --> 1:27:32.519
Get a chair, get a wheelchair.

1:27:37.856 --> 1:27:38.822
Awesome.

1:27:38.857 --> 1:27:39.658
Okay.

1:27:40.529 --> 1:27:41.792
- There you go, have a seat.

1:27:41.827 --> 1:27:43.695
- Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

1:27:45.798 --> 1:27:46.665
- You okay.

1:27:46.700 --> 1:27:49.030
Okay just relax, relax, relax.

1:27:49.065 --> 1:27:50.636
- You relax.

1:27:50.671 --> 1:27:51.670
- You're doing great.

1:27:51.705 --> 1:27:53.936
- Well how's it
looking Doc?

1:27:53.971 --> 1:27:55.135
Oh my God.

1:27:55.170 --> 1:27:56.378
- Get outta here.
- Oh my God.

1:27:56.413 --> 1:27:57.841
Oh my God.
- What are you doing?

1:27:57.876 --> 1:28:00.679
I saw the, I saw the head, oh.

1:28:02.419 --> 1:28:05.354
- Robert, Robert woman up.

1:28:05.389 --> 1:28:06.685
- Okay.

1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:07.818
- Okay stay with me.

1:28:07.853 --> 1:28:10.986
Breathe, breathe,
bear down and push.

1:28:13.661 --> 1:28:14.693
- Push.

1:28:30.909 --> 1:28:31.743
Give it to her.

1:28:31.778 --> 1:28:33.041
Oh my God.

1:28:33.076 --> 1:28:33.877
Oh my God.

1:28:38.213 --> 1:28:39.388
Oh my God.

1:28:41.249 --> 1:28:42.149
- Hi.

1:28:44.791 --> 1:28:46.186
- It's so cute.

1:28:50.929 --> 1:28:52.830
- You're so perfect.

1:28:52.865 --> 1:28:53.765
She's perfect.

1:28:56.770 --> 1:28:58.099
Hi.

1:28:58.134 --> 1:28:59.771
Hi.

1:28:59.806 --> 1:29:02.235
Don't poke her nose.
- I'm just touching her.

1:29:08.584 --> 1:29:09.385
Hey.

1:29:10.553 --> 1:29:11.882
I'm your daddy.

1:29:13.721 --> 1:29:14.489
Yeah.

1:29:16.284 --> 1:29:17.855
I'm your daddy.

1:29:51.957 --> 1:29:53.693
- Where the hell's everything?

1:29:57.501 --> 1:29:58.500
- It's gone.

1:29:58.535 --> 1:29:59.864
- You gotta be
fucking kidding me.

1:30:03.606 --> 1:30:04.363
Fuck.

1:30:07.775 --> 1:30:08.972
<i>While Tommy was fencing</i>

1:30:09.007 --> 1:30:11.007
<i>1.2 million in stolen jewels,</i>

1:30:11.042 --> 1:30:13.306
<i>the cops were tracing the</i>
<i>shotgun from Vancouver</i>

1:30:13.341 --> 1:30:15.044
<i>right back to Diamond Dave.</i>

1:30:15.882 --> 1:30:19.752
<i>And me, well, when shit</i>
<i>goes south, I go north.</i>

1:30:19.787 --> 1:30:21.182
- Robert, what?

1:30:32.228 --> 1:30:34.833
Are you gonna tell
me what's going on?

1:30:34.868 --> 1:30:36.032
- Look, they're
watching the airports

1:30:36.067 --> 1:30:37.132
and the train stations.

1:30:37.167 --> 1:30:40.102
This is the safe play.

1:30:40.137 --> 1:30:42.038
Tommy helped set this whole
thing up, last minute.

1:30:42.073 --> 1:30:44.040
- What about the plan?

1:30:44.075 --> 1:30:45.547
What about the Bahamas?

1:30:45.582 --> 1:30:49.881
- Look, sitting there
holding her in that hospital.

1:30:51.511 --> 1:30:53.346
I don't know, it's like
I spent my entire life

1:30:53.381 --> 1:30:56.888
working towards something
like this idea of an escape,

1:30:56.923 --> 1:30:58.659
this perfect ocean-side life,

1:30:58.694 --> 1:31:03.895
but with all this, you two are
the only escape that I need.

1:31:04.601 --> 1:31:08.064
And like you said,
"Wherever we are is home."

1:31:09.364 --> 1:31:10.803
Right?

1:31:10.838 --> 1:31:11.771
- Are we safe?

1:31:14.776 --> 1:31:15.544
- Yeah.

1:31:15.579 --> 1:31:16.644
- Okay.

1:31:16.679 --> 1:31:19.009
- New digs new town, right.

1:31:19.044 --> 1:31:20.582
They don't know
who or where I am.

1:31:20.617 --> 1:31:25.620
So, welcome home.

1:31:37.766 --> 1:31:38.567
Hey.

1:31:43.871 --> 1:31:45.904
- <i> It's not</i>
<i>often you get a second</i> chance

1:31:45.939 --> 1:31:47.708
<i>where the universe</i>
<i>opens up and says,</i>

1:31:47.743 --> 1:31:48.907
<i>"Don't fuck this up."</i>

1:31:49.976 --> 1:31:53.010
<i>But I was listening, I was out.</i>

1:31:53.045 --> 1:31:54.682
<i>Besides in bank robbery,</i>

1:31:54.717 --> 1:31:56.882
<i>they don't really have a</i>
<i>bring your kid to work day.</i>

1:32:09.424 --> 1:32:11.127
- All right, here we go.

1:32:11.162 --> 1:32:12.293
Here we go.

1:32:13.736 --> 1:32:15.571
Goddess, we're home.

1:32:16.970 --> 1:32:18.068
- In here.

1:32:18.103 --> 1:32:19.102
Hi.

1:32:19.137 --> 1:32:21.434
- Oh, I know that smile.

1:32:21.469 --> 1:32:22.710
- You like that smile.

1:32:22.745 --> 1:32:24.470
- I do like that
smile, how are you?

1:32:25.407 --> 1:32:26.681
And how are you?

1:32:28.080 --> 1:32:29.145
- Listen, we still need to talk

1:32:29.180 --> 1:32:30.377
about that addition
on the office.

1:32:30.412 --> 1:32:31.983
Are we still good?

1:32:32.018 --> 1:32:33.050
- Yeah.

1:32:33.085 --> 1:32:33.820
- Yeah?
- Uh huh.

1:32:33.855 --> 1:32:34.623
- Okay.

1:32:34.658 --> 1:32:35.415
- Of course.

1:32:37.188 --> 1:32:38.627
- Oh, grab that, I'm
gonna put her down.

1:32:38.662 --> 1:32:39.727
- Yeah, okay, okay.

1:32:39.762 --> 1:32:41.025
Come on, let's go.

1:32:43.425 --> 1:32:45.425
- Hey, I'm looking for my
friend, Robert Whiteman.

1:32:45.460 --> 1:32:46.701
- Oh my God.

1:32:48.100 --> 1:32:49.902
- My good buddy.
- What are you doing here?

1:32:49.937 --> 1:32:51.167
- Ah, just passing through.

1:32:51.202 --> 1:32:52.168
- Nobody just passes
through Pembroke.

1:32:52.203 --> 1:32:53.433
- That's damn right.

1:32:53.468 --> 1:32:55.501
- Hey, she's putting
the baby down.

1:32:55.536 --> 1:32:56.601
Grab a seat, I'll
get some beers.

1:32:56.636 --> 1:32:57.712
- Sure.
-All right.

1:33:04.314 --> 1:33:05.115
- Hey.

1:33:05.150 --> 1:33:06.149
Thanks.

1:33:06.184 --> 1:33:07.117
- You got it.

1:33:18.735 --> 1:33:21.329
- Having a toddler is like
owning a blender with no top.

1:33:22.332 --> 1:33:24.200
- Her toys have toys.

1:33:24.235 --> 1:33:25.465
- Yeah.

1:33:28.206 --> 1:33:29.678
You know, I always thought

1:33:29.713 --> 1:33:31.042
sweatpants were a
sign of defeat,

1:33:31.077 --> 1:33:32.340
but you actually
make 'em look good.

1:33:32.375 --> 1:33:34.243
They should stick
you in a storefront.

1:33:36.049 --> 1:33:39.655
- All right, Tommy, what
are you really doing here?

1:33:42.517 --> 1:33:45.089
- You're not used to having
any real friends, are you?

1:33:47.093 --> 1:33:49.027
I just came to see
how you were doing.

1:33:49.062 --> 1:33:50.061
- Yeah?

1:33:50.096 --> 1:33:51.029
- Yeah.

1:33:51.064 --> 1:33:51.865
- I'm good.

1:33:52.769 --> 1:33:53.702
I'm real good.

1:33:53.737 --> 1:33:55.000
- You sure?

1:33:55.035 --> 1:33:55.737
- Yeah.

1:33:56.905 --> 1:33:58.168
- 'Cause I never
thought I'd see the day

1:33:58.203 --> 1:34:01.039
when Robert Whiteman be
cutting his own grass.

1:34:01.074 --> 1:34:02.304
- Yeah, whoever
thought that weeds

1:34:02.339 --> 1:34:04.174
would be my biggest
problem, right?

1:34:08.114 --> 1:34:09.113
- You don't miss it.

1:34:10.413 --> 1:34:11.214
- Nah.

1:34:12.789 --> 1:34:14.514
Nah, it was just
a means to an end.

1:34:18.520 --> 1:34:19.992
- You know the older I get,

1:34:20.027 --> 1:34:22.423
I realized all the
stuff I don't need.

1:34:22.458 --> 1:34:23.688
All the stuff that when I go,

1:34:23.723 --> 1:34:25.393
they're just gonna
toss it in the trash.

1:34:26.297 --> 1:34:27.428
- Yeah, well you'll
definitely have

1:34:27.463 --> 1:34:28.869
the nicest trash on the block.

1:34:28.904 --> 1:34:29.661
- Thank you.

1:34:29.696 --> 1:34:30.464
- Yeah.

1:34:37.572 --> 1:34:39.374
- It's funny, I can't
think of a single toy

1:34:39.409 --> 1:34:40.782
I ever had as a kid.

1:34:42.379 --> 1:34:45.787
Probably because I never
had much of anything at all.

1:34:45.822 --> 1:34:46.711
Used to me piss me off,

1:34:46.746 --> 1:34:47.954
seeing all these other kids

1:34:47.989 --> 1:34:49.956
playing with their
toys and shit.

1:34:49.991 --> 1:34:51.419
I had zip, but that was okay.

1:34:51.454 --> 1:34:54.389
'Cause it taught me to
appreciate what I earned.

1:34:54.424 --> 1:34:56.897
See once you know what it's
like to have something,

1:34:56.932 --> 1:34:58.228
well then you gotta have more.

1:34:59.495 --> 1:35:01.968
It doesn't matter whether
you're rich or poor.

1:35:02.003 --> 1:35:03.266
You're always gonna live

1:35:03.301 --> 1:35:05.169
to just a little bit
beyond your means.

1:35:06.436 --> 1:35:08.073
So you gotta know your limits.

1:35:11.012 --> 1:35:15.278
You, me, we got everything,
everything that matters.

1:35:15.313 --> 1:35:17.577
All that other shit is
just ashes and dust,

1:35:17.612 --> 1:35:18.853
like we're gonna be.

1:35:19.746 --> 1:35:20.613
- So what are you saying,

1:35:20.648 --> 1:35:21.889
you getting outta the game?

1:35:21.924 --> 1:35:23.924
- Nah, nah, nah,
too old to grow up.

1:35:25.829 --> 1:35:31.459
But you, do not tickle
the balls of the lion

1:35:31.494 --> 1:35:32.493
on the way out kid.

1:35:34.266 --> 1:35:36.464
Hate to see you get mauled.

1:36:11.633 --> 1:36:12.797
- Shit.

1:36:27.385 --> 1:36:28.186
- No.

1:36:35.063 --> 1:36:37.360
- I gotta do just one more.

1:36:38.561 --> 1:36:39.692
One last one.

1:36:41.366 --> 1:36:43.696
- We'll find another way.

1:36:43.731 --> 1:36:46.402
- It's the only thing
I've ever been good at.

1:36:48.043 --> 1:36:49.207
There is no other way.

1:36:49.242 --> 1:36:51.077
- There's always another way.

1:36:52.542 --> 1:36:53.673
We had a deal.

1:36:57.954 --> 1:36:58.744
Okay?

1:37:02.222 --> 1:37:03.023
- Okay.

1:37:06.259 --> 1:37:08.897
You're right, you're right.

1:37:08.932 --> 1:37:10.591
It was a stupid idea.

1:37:12.694 --> 1:37:13.869
- You promise?

1:37:17.369 --> 1:37:18.368
- I promise.

1:37:20.867 --> 1:37:22.372
I'll make a few
calls in the morning

1:37:22.407 --> 1:37:24.638
and I'll see what I can do.

1:37:27.445 --> 1:37:28.246
- Okay.

1:37:50.501 --> 1:37:52.402
- Don't be like me.

1:38:00.775 --> 1:38:01.741
Thank you.

1:39:15.355 --> 1:39:16.222
- Robert.

1:39:21.691 --> 1:39:23.889
What are you crying about?

1:39:24.529 --> 1:39:25.561
Come on.

1:39:29.270 --> 1:39:30.038
Robert.

1:39:32.108 --> 1:39:33.833
How are you, today?

1:39:34.902 --> 1:39:36.077
Robert.

1:39:36.112 --> 1:39:37.111
Let's get some food.

1:39:49.950 --> 1:39:52.423
- Car's still in the
driveway, Whiteman's gone.

1:39:52.458 --> 1:39:54.557
<i>I think Andrea and the</i>
<i>kid are still inside.</i>

1:39:54.592 --> 1:39:56.592
- It's taken us this
long to get this far,

1:39:56.627 --> 1:39:58.825
I am not gonna let
him get away.

1:39:58.860 --> 1:40:00.530
- <i> Any ideas?</i>

1:40:21.322 --> 1:40:22.420
- Hello.

1:40:22.455 --> 1:40:23.685
- Hey, is Rob there please?

1:40:23.720 --> 1:40:24.455
- No, he's not.

1:40:24.490 --> 1:40:26.424
Can I take a message?

1:40:26.459 --> 1:40:28.426
- Nah, nah, no worries,
no, I'll call back.

1:40:28.461 --> 1:40:29.625
I'll call back, thanks.

1:40:45.445 --> 1:40:46.642
He's not there.

1:40:47.513 --> 1:40:48.611
- Got spook jumped town?

1:40:48.646 --> 1:40:50.151
I don't know.

1:40:50.186 --> 1:40:51.812
- No, no, he wouldn't
leave without her.

1:40:53.519 --> 1:40:55.420
- We only got the TRU
and the war for tonight,

1:40:55.455 --> 1:40:56.322
we gotta make this happen.

1:40:56.357 --> 1:40:57.081
- He's making a move.

1:40:57.116 --> 1:40:58.423
He's making a move.

1:40:58.458 --> 1:41:00.227
Call the airports, call
the train stations, okay.

1:41:00.262 --> 1:41:01.657
I'll call the buses
and the car rentals.

1:41:01.692 --> 1:41:02.955
Come on, let's go,
this goes down now

1:41:02.990 --> 1:41:04.330
or we start all over.

1:41:31.953 --> 1:41:33.084
- <i> Goddess.</i>

1:41:34.560 --> 1:41:35.526

1:41:37.024 --> 1:41:38.430
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1:41:38.465 --> 1:41:41.796
Yeah, yeah, I got in touch
with an old buddy of mine

1:41:41.831 --> 1:41:46.064
who has a line on
a gig out here.

1:41:47.243 --> 1:41:49.309
<i>It's just sale stuff,</i>
<i>nothing fancy.</i>

1:41:49.344 --> 1:41:52.477
<i>But I dunno it'll pay</i>
<i>the bills, right?</i>

1:41:52.512 --> 1:41:53.544
- When will you know?

1:41:54.877 --> 1:41:57.614
- Well, I'm supposed to
sit down with them soon.

1:41:57.649 --> 1:42:01.585
So I have a really, really
good feeling about it.

1:42:04.227 --> 1:42:06.293
- Well, I'm sure it'll be great.

1:42:06.328 --> 1:42:07.558
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1:42:07.593 --> 1:42:08.955
<i>Yeah.</i>

1:42:08.990 --> 1:42:11.397
<i>So I should be</i>
<i>home by like- 30.</i>

1:42:11.432 --> 1:42:12.893
<i>Can you pick me</i>
<i>up at the airport?</i>

1:42:14.732 --> 1:42:16.468
- Sure.

1:42:16.503 --> 1:42:18.206
Yeah, of course,
I'll see you then.

1:42:19.033 --> 1:42:21.374
<i>- Hey, you know.</i>

1:42:24.104 --> 1:42:25.213
- I love you too.

1:42:27.778 --> 1:42:28.678
- Bye, bye.

1:43:04.419 --> 1:43:06.518
- Okay, all right, let me know.

1:43:06.553 --> 1:43:09.950
Nothing, nothing at the airport,
train stations or buses.

1:43:12.119 --> 1:43:13.261
We're not paying you
to sit on your asses,

1:43:13.296 --> 1:43:14.086

1:43:16.596 --> 1:43:17.562

1:43:30.841 --> 1:43:32.313
Did you check the local airport?

1:43:36.484 --> 1:43:37.483
- He may have
chartered a flight

1:43:37.518 --> 1:43:38.880
out of Pembroke to Toronto.

1:43:38.915 --> 1:43:41.080
From Toronto to London
credit card puts him there.

1:43:41.115 --> 1:43:43.423
- No wonder he was able
to do it under the radar.

1:43:43.458 --> 1:43:45.953

the regional airport as a hub.

1:49:38.945 --> 1:49:40.307
His pants fit like a glove.

1:49:42.784 --> 1:49:44.014

1:49:57.557 --> 1:49:59.359
- What's that?
- You, you.

1:49:59.394 --> 1:50:00.833
- Really?
- Yes.

1:50:00.868 --> 1:50:01.768
- Well, thank you.

1:50:01.803 --> 1:50:03.363

1:50:03.398 --> 1:50:04.870
and you just, you kept going.

1:50:04.905 --> 1:50:07.235
I mean, what you weren't
loved enough as a kid?

1:50:09.503 --> 1:50:12.812
- Is that, that is
eyeliner isn't it?

1:50:14.046 --> 1:50:16.145
- Well maybe it's Maybelline.
- If it's not, then well...

1:50:16.180 --> 1:50:18.378
beautiful eyelashes.

1:50:18.413 --> 1:50:19.852
- What do you say,
you give us Tommy

1:50:19.887 --> 1:50:21.018
and we give you less time?

1:50:21.053 --> 1:50:23.185
- Tommy's a businessman.

1:50:23.220 --> 1:50:25.187
There's nothing to give, ever.

1:50:27.092 --> 1:50:28.553
And you got nothing on me, so.

1:50:28.588 --> 1:50:29.697
- No, no, no.

1:50:29.732 --> 1:50:32.128
Well we ran your
prints with the feds.

1:50:32.163 --> 1:50:34.031
- Oh?
- Yeah.

1:50:34.066 --> 1:50:36.066
- Vincent Smears
is a terrible name.

1:50:36.101 --> 1:50:38.629
I mean, I can see why
you went with Whiteman.

1:50:38.664 --> 1:50:40.202
- Well.

1:50:40.237 --> 1:50:41.236
You got me.

1:50:43.240 --> 1:50:44.503
You guys are good.

1:50:47.178 --> 1:50:50.245
Okay, I'll tell you more,

1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:54.920
if you let me have a face
to face with my wife.

1:50:55.890 --> 1:50:57.857
- She's not exactly your
biggest fan right now.

1:50:57.892 --> 1:50:59.056
Especially after
learning your name

1:50:59.091 --> 1:51:01.025
isn't actually Whiteman.

1:51:04.063 --> 1:51:05.227
- Did somebody order a pizza?

1:51:05.262 --> 1:51:06.393
- Oh yeah, right here.

1:51:09.563 --> 1:51:10.562
Thank you.

1:51:12.269 --> 1:51:13.202
There we go.

1:51:15.140 --> 1:51:16.172
You want some?

1:51:16.207 --> 1:51:17.239
- No, I'm
good, I'm good.

1:51:17.274 --> 1:51:18.570
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm good.

1:51:18.605 --> 1:51:19.439
It's all you.

1:51:25.480 --> 1:51:27.216
Run the prints with
the feds again.

1:51:27.251 --> 1:51:28.921
There's something wiry, okay.

1:51:29.825 --> 1:51:32.221
- Hey, how is he?

1:51:33.796 --> 1:51:35.587
- Cocky and arrogant
as hell, yeah.

1:51:35.622 --> 1:51:38.029
But he grows on you, yeah.

1:51:38.064 --> 1:51:39.294
Oh, and get me the wife.

1:51:48.943 --> 1:51:52.813
- So if your name
isn't Robert Whiteman,

1:51:52.848 --> 1:51:54.309
is it just asshole or?

1:51:55.477 --> 1:51:58.214
- Well, there are a few things
that I may have left out.

1:51:58.249 --> 1:51:59.182
- Yeah.

1:52:08.127 --> 1:52:09.830
So what are you just a
bank robber now?

1:52:09.865 --> 1:52:11.623
Is there anything
else you left out?

1:52:12.593 --> 1:52:13.526
Hmm.

1:52:18.599 --> 1:52:21.336
When we met, I had
one thing in my life.

1:52:24.880 --> 1:52:26.209
I believed in people.

1:52:29.181 --> 1:52:31.445
And you're not gonna
take that away from me.

1:52:33.713 --> 1:52:35.119
Robert, look at me.

1:52:38.058 --> 1:52:39.321
You gotta tell me,

1:52:42.788 --> 1:52:44.623
was I a part of this big lie?

1:52:46.198 --> 1:52:47.296
Was I a cover?

1:52:47.331 --> 1:52:48.462
- No.

1:52:49.234 --> 1:52:51.135
You're the only real
thing in my life.

1:52:52.072 --> 1:52:55.733
I'm more me around you than
I've ever been around anyone.

1:52:58.881 --> 1:53:00.804
You taught me how to live,
you taught me how to love,

1:53:00.839 --> 1:53:03.345
you taught me how to trust.

1:53:06.581 --> 1:53:08.548
And that's the truth,
that's not a lie.

1:53:12.994 --> 1:53:14.554
- All right, well
that was pretty good.

1:53:17.262 --> 1:53:19.559
I still think you're
an asshole though.

1:53:19.594 --> 1:53:20.461
- Also the truth.

1:53:20.496 --> 1:53:21.231
- Yeah.

1:53:25.864 --> 1:53:26.874
- I'm sorry.

1:53:31.078 --> 1:53:33.375
And I know that's never gonna
be enough, but I'm sorry.

1:53:33.410 --> 1:53:34.277
I fucked up.

1:53:35.874 --> 1:53:37.181
I fucked it up.

1:53:44.685 --> 1:53:45.684
- So now what?

1:53:48.062 --> 1:53:49.127
- You should run.

1:53:50.394 --> 1:53:52.031
Get as far away
from me as you can,

1:53:52.066 --> 1:53:53.659
I can handle this.

1:53:53.694 --> 1:53:54.935
- Clearly you can't.

1:53:57.467 --> 1:53:58.235
And you know what?

1:53:58.270 --> 1:53:59.434
I'm not like you Robert.

1:54:01.273 --> 1:54:02.602
I don't run.

1:54:19.918 --> 1:54:21.159
- How you been, partner?

1:54:22.129 --> 1:54:23.392
Treating you okay in here?

1:54:23.427 --> 1:54:24.624
- I'm all right, I'm all right.

1:54:26.298 --> 1:54:29.827
Look, I'm sorry if any of
this brought shit down on you.

1:54:31.501 --> 1:54:32.599
- Hey, they found
you through me.

1:54:32.634 --> 1:54:34.139
I should be apologizing to you.

1:54:35.901 --> 1:54:37.978
What kind of time they talking?

1:54:38.013 --> 1:54:40.739
- I'm looking at 20.

1:54:41.940 --> 1:54:44.281
I copped to all
the robberies, they're...

1:54:44.316 --> 1:54:45.986
probably charge me for two.

1:54:46.989 --> 1:54:50.353
Probably be out
by '98, '99.

1:54:52.918 --> 1:54:54.390
- Yeah, you could
probably do a better deal,

1:54:54.425 --> 1:54:55.655
you turn in the others.

1:54:56.427 --> 1:54:58.163
Me alone, you'd be out in eight.

1:55:01.366 --> 1:55:03.432
- I don't know a lot
about friends or family,

1:55:03.467 --> 1:55:04.972
but I would never do that.

1:55:09.110 --> 1:55:10.736
