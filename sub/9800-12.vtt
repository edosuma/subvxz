00:45.461 --> 00:46.928
Hello.

00:46.996 --> 00:49.191
Look alive, men.

00:49.265 --> 00:51.165
Time to get us some popcorn.

00:51.233 --> 00:54.168
Prepare to commence
"Operation Popcorn."

00:54.236 --> 00:56.431
Bit on the nose,
isn't it, Skipper?

00:56.505 --> 00:58.973
- Easy to remember, though.
- Popcorn!

00:59.041 --> 01:01.669
Roger that, Rico. Go time.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.074
- Private, decoy duty.
- No problem.

01:07.149 --> 01:09.379
I've been working
on my waddle, Skipper.

01:09.919 --> 01:10.977
Wow.

01:27.736 --> 01:28.794
Outstanding!

01:31.740 --> 01:35.107
Regurgitated.
Just like Mama used to make.

01:35.177 --> 01:36.474
Dance, Mort!

01:36.545 --> 01:41.107
Dance for the silly humans, and they
throw the delicious poppity-corn at us!

01:41.183 --> 01:43.947
Popcorn, I like this!

01:45.521 --> 01:49.082
Maurice, your booty
is barely shaking.

01:49.458 --> 01:54.191
Watch. Eyes on me. Both eyes, Maurice.
Your lazy eye, too.

01:54.263 --> 01:58.927
- I don't have a lazy...
- No, it's OK! Look, I have one, too!

02:02.104 --> 02:07.508
Yes! You are powerless
to King Julien's superior robot skills.

02:22.992 --> 02:25.517
- Hey, little animal lover.
- Hi.

02:25.594 --> 02:27.027
I'm Zookeeper Alice.

02:27.096 --> 02:33.035
Did you know that every last beastie
in this zoo is on a very special diet?

02:33.102 --> 02:35.263
I guess.

02:35.337 --> 02:38.932
You guess.
You're a little guesser, are ya?

02:39.008 --> 02:42.705
I have a Zookeeper Alice
tip for you, little guesser!

02:42.778 --> 02:43.767
Do...

02:43.846 --> 02:44.870
not...

02:44.947 --> 02:47.711
feed... the... animals!

02:51.954 --> 02:55.583
- Maurice. Make them shush now.
- Order! Order!

02:55.658 --> 02:57.558
Hey, you guys, come on!

02:57.626 --> 03:00.595
Everybody calm down!

03:02.631 --> 03:05.031
There. OK, great.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.034
I can't live without popcorn!

03:07.102 --> 03:10.902
- Popcorn!
- Popcorn, popcorn, popcorn...

03:15.344 --> 03:17.437
I'll get your popped corn.

03:17.513 --> 03:21.244
- Something smells fishy.
- Yeah. I don't know about these guys.

03:21.317 --> 03:25.811
No. I mean they stink of actual fish,
Maurice. Open a window.

03:25.888 --> 03:28.356
Here's what we know.
Alice has clamped down.

03:28.424 --> 03:32.121
She's actually enforcing the
"Do Not Feed the Animals" policy.

03:32.194 --> 03:34.924
All popcorn supply lines
have been cut off. Finito!

03:34.997 --> 03:39.832
But not to worry.
We have a plan. Rico?

03:39.902 --> 03:42.427
Maurice, where is my plan?

03:42.504 --> 03:44.597
Why don't you vomit up a plan?

03:44.673 --> 03:46.766
And do something
about the stink.

03:46.842 --> 03:49.709
The only thing that stinks here
is your attitude.

03:49.778 --> 03:51.643
The Skipper likes team players.

03:51.714 --> 03:55.480
So do l. As long as
I am in charge of the team.

03:55.551 --> 03:59.647
OK, my kingly plan
is coming to me...

03:59.722 --> 04:03.988
First, obviously, we must get rid
of that insane zookeeper Alice.

04:04.059 --> 04:07.790
Negatory. You'll just get
more Alices in her place.

04:07.863 --> 04:10.764
- A lot more Alices.
- Give us a number, Kowalski.

04:10.833 --> 04:13.324
- 42.
- Good. Show me your math later.

04:13.402 --> 04:18.668
Excuse me, fishy, interrupting bird.
Your king, which is me, is very busy.

04:18.741 --> 04:21.175
Maybe you didn't get the memo, punk,

04:21.243 --> 04:24.269
but this zoo runs
on democratic principles.

04:24.346 --> 04:26.678
And I don't think
we put you in charge.

04:26.749 --> 04:28.182
Did we?

04:28.917 --> 04:31.283
How could I not be in charge?

04:31.353 --> 04:34.948
Being in charge
is what kings do. So, shut up.

04:35.024 --> 04:38.960
- I vote for you.
- Not the feet! Do not touch the feet!

04:39.028 --> 04:42.395
OK. Let's get a little,
I don't know, creative here.

04:42.464 --> 04:47.561
What if we all work together
to get the popcorn?

04:48.837 --> 04:50.134
Fine. Whatever.

04:50.205 --> 04:53.902
OK, you each do it your own way and
may the best species win. Good luck.

04:53.976 --> 04:56.740
Failure is not an option.

04:56.812 --> 04:59.872
Which is fine by me
because I do not intend to fail.

04:59.948 --> 05:02.712
I vow to do the opposite of fail.

05:02.785 --> 05:05.345
You mean succeed?

05:05.421 --> 05:10.484
No, I will not "suck seed."
No one will be sucking seed.

05:10.559 --> 05:14.893
- We will all be eating popcorn!
- So, you have a plan?

05:14.963 --> 05:17.397
Better! I have confidence!

05:17.466 --> 05:20.833
Shall we leave this
to the professionals?

05:21.336 --> 05:23.304
I think so. Rico!

05:25.407 --> 05:29.867
According to this symbol,
which appears to be Aztec in origin...

05:29.945 --> 05:32.379
- You are here.
- Tell me something I don't know.

05:32.448 --> 05:34.939
Without mucus, your
stomach would digest itself.

05:35.017 --> 05:39.477
Tell me something else I don't know.
Something less disturbing, maybe.

05:40.789 --> 05:43.121
Snack storage facility
at eleven o'clock.

05:43.192 --> 05:46.127
Blast! It's already 1 0:.57.
We don't have much time.

05:51.733 --> 05:55.225
Rico! No unauthorized
personnel on missions.

05:55.304 --> 05:58.796
Sorry, doll-face.
Maybe another place, another time.

06:07.883 --> 06:09.145
Attack-stack, men!

06:12.121 --> 06:14.112
Target acquired.

06:18.293 --> 06:20.318
Keep it together, Private.

06:20.395 --> 06:22.488
Reverse formation... now!

06:25.601 --> 06:30.231
This reeks of fishy,
flightless bird-type creatures.

06:30.305 --> 06:34.173
- I suspect that they came this way.
- No kidding.

06:34.243 --> 06:36.438
Where's the popcorn?

06:36.512 --> 06:39.811
- There's the popcorn.
- Well played, Mort.

06:39.882 --> 06:41.349
Skipper, look!

06:41.416 --> 06:44.613
Keep your stinkin'
opposable thumbs off our popcorn!

06:44.686 --> 06:47.849
This is not yours.
Mort found it. Right, Mort?

06:49.491 --> 06:51.254
Finders keepers.

06:51.326 --> 06:53.123
Kowalski? Legal analysis.

06:53.195 --> 06:57.154
He's got you, Skipper. It's
the Finder's Keepers Treaty of 1 859.

06:57.232 --> 07:00.133
Blast! Secure another bag, men.

07:01.236 --> 07:04.672
Prepare to eat popcorn
'til your guts explode.

07:04.740 --> 07:05.729
Rico!

07:07.209 --> 07:08.972
- What?
- Huh?

07:09.044 --> 07:12.673
This doesn't look anything
like the picture on the bag.

07:12.748 --> 07:15.046
It isn't very puffy.

07:18.954 --> 07:24.483
Only l, King Julien, have the key
to this mysterious mystery.

07:24.560 --> 07:28.997
- I've got a clean shot, Skipper.
- Hold your fire. He's bluffing.

07:29.064 --> 07:33.558
They are popcorn eggs! They need
to be hatched under our warm bottoms.

07:33.635 --> 07:37.765
That would be... really...

07:37.839 --> 07:39.670
Yeah, I don't what that would be.

07:39.741 --> 07:43.370
Marlene, I think the word
you're looking for is "ridiculous."

07:43.445 --> 07:45.879
We shall see who is ridiculous

07:45.948 --> 07:49.384
when popcorn begins
exploding from my bottom!

07:51.954 --> 07:56.516
That lunatic will not be our king.
We'll crack that popcorn code.

07:56.592 --> 08:00.187
- Skipper! Alice is on the move!
- Rico, kill the lights.

08:02.130 --> 08:04.360
I meant turn them off.

08:16.878 --> 08:18.436
Rico!

08:22.284 --> 08:24.718
Mort, Maurice, gather 'round.

08:24.786 --> 08:27.050
Everyone grab an egg.

08:27.122 --> 08:31.786
Now put it under
your bottoms like so.

08:32.727 --> 08:36.994
Think warm-bottom thoughts.

08:37.065 --> 08:39.397
Do like I'm doing!

08:41.870 --> 08:44.998
I think mine's hatching!

08:46.675 --> 08:49.235
Remind me not to eat that one.

08:49.945 --> 08:51.640
We need answers, now!

08:51.713 --> 08:56.741
Talk, mister! Where are
your fluffy little friends?

08:56.818 --> 09:01.915
We can do this the easy way
or we can do this Rico's way.

09:03.058 --> 09:05.390
Skipper, our bag's sprung a leak.

09:05.460 --> 09:06.484
A leak?

09:06.561 --> 09:10.930
Yo, Alice. Aren't you supposed
to be shoveling the elephant poop?

09:10.999 --> 09:13.832
I can't. I'm investigating
the warehouse break-in.

09:13.902 --> 09:17.668
Two sacks of popcorn are missing,
and I think I'm onto something.

09:20.208 --> 09:21.869
Penguins.

09:24.513 --> 09:26.811
Skipper, I think Alice
might be onto us.

09:26.882 --> 09:28.782
One side, Private.

09:30.052 --> 09:31.849
Kowalski, Rico, hit the water.

09:31.920 --> 09:33.751
Private, help me hide the popcorn.

09:33.822 --> 09:37.087
The incinerator's
the last place she'll ever look.

09:45.167 --> 09:47.567
It's like nothing happened.

09:48.236 --> 09:50.227
Skipper, something happened!

09:54.343 --> 09:55.640
Fire in the hole!

09:58.180 --> 09:59.647
Earthquake!

09:59.715 --> 10:01.706
I knew it!

10:03.552 --> 10:05.543
It's hatching!

10:05.620 --> 10:08.817
I knew I shouldn't have
installed those decorative spikes.

10:08.890 --> 10:11.586
- Kaboom?
- I'm going to say "yes."

10:16.264 --> 10:18.061
I'll get to the bottom of...

10:19.468 --> 10:24.132
Yo, Alice, you find that
missing popcorn yet or what?

10:24.206 --> 10:26.697
You can say that, yes.

10:26.775 --> 10:28.640
It's a pop-storm!

10:28.710 --> 10:32.146
Or, is it a corn-ado?

10:34.182 --> 10:38.016
Skipper, I have to say
you guys rock.

10:38.086 --> 10:41.283
Marlene, let's just say...
mission accomplished.

10:42.090 --> 10:44.081
We showed those lemurs, Skipper.

10:44.159 --> 10:47.856
You bet we did, Private.
Even that delusional king has to know

10:47.929 --> 10:50.659
when he's licked
like an all-day sucker.

10:50.732 --> 10:56.261
My bottom is magic. The salty-snack
gods have chosen to reward me.

10:56.338 --> 10:59.239
Thank you, salty-snack gods!

10:59.307 --> 11:04.836
Is there any doubt now that I am king?
It's by divine right! Right?

11:04.913 --> 11:07.108
Right.

11:09.384 --> 11:14.117
You know, men, I'm actually
pretty darn sick of popcorn.
