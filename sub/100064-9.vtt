10:05.305 --> 10:06.239
They locked us in.

10:06.272 --> 10:07.507
It's chaos over here.

10:07.540 --> 10:11.010
Everybody's attacking each other
and our coach just went psycho.

10:11.044 --> 10:13.546
We're hiding in the hotel
and I don't know

10:13.580 --> 10:14.747
how much longer we can
hide here for.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.216
Dad said he sent people
to find you.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.150
Vi, I'm scared.

10:17.183 --> 10:19.385
Stay put. You have to hold on,
okay?

10:19.419 --> 10:20.186
I don't think we can do that.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.688
But I need you to be okay.

10:21.721 --> 10:22.889
Just tell me where
they're taking you.

10:22.922 --> 10:25.058
Tell me where I can find you!

10:25.091 --> 10:27.093
Vi, please tell me where
I can find you!

10:29.062 --> 10:30.396
What am I going to do?

10:31.564 --> 10:35.335
[screaming]

10:37.103 --> 10:43.943
[screaming]

10:46.412 --> 10:48.715
Wait, wait! My phone!

10:48.748 --> 10:49.149
No, Kim!

10:49.182 --> 10:50.783
Kim, Kim, don't

10:50.817 --> 10:54.354

[screaming]

12:08.661 --> 12:12.498
[sobbing]

12:12.532 --> 12:15.168
I'm sorry.

12:15.201 --> 12:16.069
I killed her.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.338
Before she killed us.

12:19.038 --> 12:20.006
I'm sorry.

12:20.039 --> 12:20.440
I'm sorry.

12:20.473 --> 12:22.909
Hey. Hey, Hey.

12:22.942 --> 12:23.409
Hey. Hey.

12:23.443 --> 12:24.577
I didn't mean to.

12:24.611 --> 12:25.211
I didn't mean to.

12:25.245 --> 12:28.014
Hey, hey.
You had to.

12:28.047 --> 12:30.250
You had to.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.519
You had to, okay, Jack?

12:33.553 --> 12:35.388
We gotta go.
Jack, we gotta go.

12:35.421 --> 12:36.256
Get up, get up.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.258
Come on. Come on.

12:38.291 --> 12:39.592
Come on. Come on.

12:39.626 --> 12:42.595
Come on. Come on.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.030
Come on, Jack. Come on.

12:44.063 --> 12:44.797
Go. Go.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.567
We need to find some place
to hide.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.370
Some place we can barricade
until we‐

12:50.403 --> 12:52.071
Until what?
Another one of us dies?

12:52.105 --> 12:54.007
I don't know.

12:54.574 --> 12:55.475
Jack.

12:55.508 --> 13:03.249

Wait.

13:16.262 --> 13:18.931
[fire alarm rings]

13:27.440 --> 13:30.610
Everyone needs to find something
to defend themselves.

13:34.280 --> 13:35.581
All we have are our bows.

13:35.615 --> 13:36.549
I can't kill anyone.

13:36.582 --> 13:39.252
It's not about killing,
it is about surviving.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.154
Do you get it?

13:42.355 --> 13:44.324
It's what we trained for
at the academy.

13:44.357 --> 13:45.358
Maybe none of us thought
we'd get dropped

13:45.391 --> 13:48.961
into the middle of a war zone
but here we are.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.632
Stay.

14:02.041 --> 14:04.277
We are going to find shelter
and we're gonna get in contact

14:04.310 --> 14:06.079
with someone who can help us.

14:06.112 --> 14:09.148
And we're gonna defend
ourselves until then, okay?

14:09.182 --> 14:11.084
Yeah.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.553
Okay.

14:18.491 --> 14:21.594
I need you, Jack.

14:21.627 --> 14:24.297
I can't do this without you.

[sobbing]

14:26.532 --> 14:28.434
Police station.

14:28.468 --> 14:30.169
There's a police station
up the street.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.772
Okay, we passed it
when we got here, remember?

14:32.805 --> 14:35.641
If anywhere is safe
it's there.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.477
Yes. Yes.

14:37.510 --> 14:39.679
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

Shit.

14:49.322 --> 14:50.490
Okay.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.693
When I say "go", don't stop
whatever you do.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.361
Single file, have each
other's backs.

14:55.395 --> 14:59.065
Shona, you've got our six.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.633
If we get into trouble,
attack as one.

15:00.666 --> 15:02.301
Don't get separated.
Are you ready?

15:02.335 --> 15:03.169
Ready.

15:03.202 --> 15:04.203
Ready!

15:16.716 --> 15:19.619

are in a state of emergency.

15:19.652 --> 15:20.753

15:52.885 --> 15:55.688
This is bad.

This is so bad.

Hello?

16:01.194 --> 16:03.763

Uh, guys!

17:06.058 --> 17:07.927
We should grab his gun, right?

17:07.960 --> 17:08.628
What?

17:08.661 --> 17:09.929
We have to protect ourselves.

17:09.962 --> 17:11.597
I'm not touching him.

17:11.631 --> 17:12.565
You do it.

17:12.598 --> 17:13.466
Fine.

17:14.634 --> 17:15.968
I'll do it.

17:46.198 --> 17:47.967
It's empty.

17:48.000 --> 17:51.103
What now?

17:51.137 --> 17:52.605
My phone is dead.

Jack.

17:53.139 --> 17:53.906
Please, it's your‐

17:53.940 --> 17:56.309

What? What's happening?

18:25.638 --> 18:27.607
Before there was a dial tone.

18:27.640 --> 18:28.674
Now there's nothing.

to keep trying. So...

We're dead.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.157
I'm okay.

18:46.859 --> 18:49.862
What you did back there,
you had to.

18:49.895 --> 18:50.963
You saved us.

18:50.997 --> 18:55.167
We are alive because of you.

18:55.201 --> 18:58.337
I didn't save Kim.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.806
You did what none of us
could have.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.375
You were brave.

19:02.408 --> 19:03.876
You were amazing.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.911
You...

19:05.945 --> 19:09.682
Brave? I killed her.

19:09.715 --> 19:13.152
No. You killed
whatever she had become.

19:13.185 --> 19:15.254
What you did saved us,
Jack.

19:15.287 --> 19:18.324
You are the strong one.

Look, we're just trying
to survive this, okay?

We came in here for protection
and that's it.

That's it.

21:31.290 --> 21:32.858

When the phone calls came
through everybody left

22:20.239 --> 22:23.142

to save their families.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.211
And you?

22:25.244 --> 22:27.713
I stayed here
with a couple others.

And then those things
got in here.

24:05.244 --> 24:08.547
and I'm gonna look
at your wound, okay?

24:08.580 --> 24:12.484
I just need to make sure
nothing's hit your organ.

24:12.518 --> 24:14.086
Ready?

24:15.454 --> 24:17.389
[wincing in pain]

24:19.124 --> 24:21.260
(Jack) This is bad.
This is really bad.

24:28.133 --> 24:31.303
Tell me the truth, Jack.

24:31.337 --> 24:33.272
How bad is it?

24:34.173 --> 24:35.941
You're gonna be fine.

24:35.975 --> 24:37.109
We're gonna get you
a doctor.

24:37.142 --> 24:39.011
Oh, bullshit.

24:39.044 --> 24:40.512
If the cop shop
looks like this

24:40.546 --> 24:43.515
there's no way a hospital
survived.

24:43.549 --> 24:45.184
Hey. Hey.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.952
Just leave me here.

24:46.986 --> 24:47.619
No.

24:47.653 --> 24:48.320
Leave me here.

24:48.354 --> 24:51.190
No, you don't talk like that.

24:51.223 --> 24:51.924
No, come on.

24:51.957 --> 24:54.660
Eagles for life, right?

24:54.693 --> 24:56.996
(Brittany) You can't go
out there.

24:57.029 --> 24:57.763
What do you mean?

24:57.796 --> 25:00.132
What other option
do we have?

25:00.165 --> 25:01.100
We?

25:03.202 --> 25:04.269
We?

25:05.704 --> 25:06.972
What?

25:07.006 --> 25:08.107
It's fine. You just stay here.

25:08.140 --> 25:10.642
You stay here and you make sure
that she stays awake.

25:10.676 --> 25:11.543
Hey.

25:11.577 --> 25:12.378
Okay.

25:12.411 --> 25:13.846
Yeah? Okay.

25:13.879 --> 25:15.180
Make sure she stays awake.

25:15.214 --> 25:16.615
You are not going alone.

25:16.648 --> 25:19.318
I'm coming with you.
I am coming with you.

25:19.485 --> 25:21.220
Brittany? Brittany.

25:21.253 --> 25:22.087
Hey.

25:22.121 --> 25:24.390
All you have to do is hold it,
okay?

25:24.423 --> 25:26.125
You'll be fine.
Brittany, Brittany...

25:26.158 --> 25:28.127
Give me your gun.

25:30.596 --> 25:32.731
No way.

25:32.765 --> 25:36.168
Please? I can't make this run
without it. I need it.

25:36.201 --> 25:37.036
Not a chance.

25:37.069 --> 25:40.139
Okay, well then
where's the armoury?

25:40.172 --> 25:41.573
It's been picked over.

25:41.607 --> 25:43.008
The only bullets are mine.

25:43.042 --> 25:44.076
(Brittany) You asshole.

25:44.109 --> 25:47.546
She wouldn't have to go
if it wasn't for you!

25:47.579 --> 25:49.148
You forget that I'm the one
in charge here!

25:49.181 --> 25:50.215
Hey!

25:50.249 --> 25:51.150
Please.

25:53.185 --> 25:54.319
Keep it.

25:54.686 --> 25:55.687
Keep it.

25:57.756 --> 25:59.391
We have to go.

25:59.425 --> 26:00.392
Jack, we have to go.

26:00.426 --> 26:02.027
Please.

26:10.636 --> 26:12.337
I need you to promise me
that you're gonna be here

26:12.371 --> 26:14.106
when I get back, okay?

26:14.139 --> 26:15.307
Promise?

26:20.112 --> 26:20.779
Go.

26:20.813 --> 26:22.114
Okay.

26:22.147 --> 26:23.549
Just‐ just go.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.683
Okay.

26:26.051 --> 26:28.454
Okay. Okay.

26:28.487 --> 26:29.588
Hey, wait!

26:31.623 --> 26:33.125
Listen.

26:33.158 --> 26:36.095
Underneath this building
there's a parking garage.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.130
Go down there, it'd be safer
than taking the street.

26:38.163 --> 26:41.100
Just... just take
the employee corridor.

26:41.133 --> 26:43.769
There's a door on the‐
on the right side.

26:43.802 --> 26:46.038
Go up to the street level.

26:46.071 --> 26:48.040
It empties out near a...
a free clinic.

26:48.073 --> 26:50.075
You might find a doctor there.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.777
Door on the right,
up to street level.

26:51.810 --> 26:53.112
Okay, go.

26:53.145 --> 27:02.387
Come on. Jack, please.
Let's go.

27:02.421 --> 27:05.090
Shh. Shh.

27:48.867 --> 27:50.936
Okay, okay.

27:54.907 --> 27:56.141
It's okay.

27:59.044 --> 28:00.312
Let's go.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.323
You can do it.

28:13.325 --> 28:17.329
[distant screams]

28:33.345 --> 28:37.049
(Woman)
...Somebody help! Somebody!

28:39.651 --> 28:41.119
Let's go.

28:49.595 --> 28:53.232
[car dinging]

28:58.203 --> 29:01.373
We're in the deep end,
now.

29:01.406 --> 29:02.541
Yeah.

29:07.045 --> 29:09.047
They could be anywhere.

29:26.598 --> 29:27.466
[whispers]
Shit!

29:27.499 --> 29:28.500
Hide!

29:47.319 --> 29:48.620
(Woman) Hello?

29:51.189 --> 29:57.229
[footsteps approaching]

29:57.262 --> 29:59.097
Is someone there?

30:02.167 --> 30:04.303
A real someone?

30:07.773 --> 30:09.007
[whispers]
Hey.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.976
Hey, come here.

30:11.009 --> 30:12.678
Come here.

30:12.711 --> 30:14.079
Oh my god.

30:14.112 --> 30:15.647
[sobbing]

30:15.681 --> 30:17.316
Shh.

30:17.783 --> 30:19.084
Did you see anyone else
out there?

30:19.117 --> 30:19.985
[sobbing]

30:20.018 --> 30:22.521
We were attacked
up on the street.

30:22.554 --> 30:23.689
They got my David.

30:23.722 --> 30:26.658
Shh.

30:26.692 --> 30:29.261
We lost a friend, too.

30:29.294 --> 30:31.096
They talk about the end of days
at church.

30:31.129 --> 30:33.265
I never imagined it would be
like this.

30:33.298 --> 30:34.766
We need to keep moving.

30:34.800 --> 30:35.667
We need to keep moving.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.703
Where are you going?

30:37.736 --> 30:40.105
We're going to the clinic.

30:40.138 --> 30:41.206
It's two levels up.

30:41.239 --> 30:42.174
Is it safe?

30:42.207 --> 30:43.041
I don't know.

30:43.075 --> 30:44.676
Our friend is hurt.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.278
Did she get bit by
one of those things?

30:46.311 --> 30:47.312
Shh‐ No.

30:48.313 --> 30:49.047
Are you sure?

30:49.081 --> 30:50.682
Because that's how
it spreads.

30:50.716 --> 30:51.616
The bites.

30:51.650 --> 30:52.984
She didn't get bit.

30:53.018 --> 30:53.919
She got shot, okay?

30:53.952 --> 30:55.620
What do you mean,
that's how it spreads?

30:55.654 --> 30:57.389
Is this thing some sort
of virus?

30:57.422 --> 30:59.691
All I know is one of those
nightmares grabbed my David

30:59.725 --> 31:03.562
and bit him in the neck
and then his face turned
into a monster!

31:03.595 --> 31:05.163
Shhh!

31:07.332 --> 31:10.369
Alright. Okay.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.404
You're safe with us, okay?

31:12.437 --> 31:13.638
No, I'm not.

31:13.672 --> 31:14.239
No, I'm not.

31:14.272 --> 31:15.440
No one is.

31:15.474 --> 31:19.311
They're gonna find us and
they're gonna kill us or worse!

31:19.344 --> 31:20.145
I need you to be quiet.

31:20.178 --> 31:23.181
I need you to be very quiet,
okay?

31:23.215 --> 31:24.216
Okay.

31:25.517 --> 31:26.151
[gasps]

31:26.184 --> 31:26.818
We've gotta get out of here!

31:26.852 --> 31:28.687
Shhh! Stay down. Stay down.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.021
I'll get to my car.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.323
You have a car?

31:31.356 --> 31:33.225
It's close I think.

31:33.258 --> 31:33.959
What do you mean,
you think?

31:33.992 --> 31:35.660
Well, I couldn't get to it

31:35.694 --> 31:37.763
but if I can I could take us
where we need to go.

31:37.796 --> 31:39.598
Where it's safe.

31:39.631 --> 31:40.599
We could go to our friends.

31:40.632 --> 31:41.533
We could find a hospital.

31:41.566 --> 31:42.367
No.

31:42.401 --> 31:43.301
I'm leaving.

31:43.335 --> 31:46.138
Either you come with me
right now or we...

31:50.208 --> 31:51.743
Come on. Come on.

31:51.777 --> 31:53.311
Come on.

32:12.731 --> 32:14.399
[car unlocks]

32:32.417 --> 32:34.252
I'm gonna take my hand
off your face

32:34.286 --> 32:36.455
but I'm gonna need you
to be very quiet.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.723
Can you do that?

32:38.757 --> 32:40.392
Yeah.

32:51.203 --> 32:51.736
Why?

32:51.770 --> 32:53.238
Why would you do that?

32:53.271 --> 32:54.406
That was our way out.

32:54.439 --> 32:55.774
She just saved your life.

32:55.807 --> 32:57.242
We're so close to the exit.

32:57.275 --> 32:58.477
Come on, let's go.

32:58.510 --> 33:00.479
No, I'm not going.

33:00.512 --> 33:01.346
We stay together.

33:01.379 --> 33:02.514
You're headed straight
to those things.

33:02.547 --> 33:03.548
Keep your voice down.

33:03.582 --> 33:06.818
No. They'll find us,
you know they will.

33:06.852 --> 33:08.854
The best we can do is pray.

33:08.887 --> 33:12.924
Hell has risen and will
swallow us whole.

33:12.958 --> 33:15.861
‐We have to go!
‐The end of time is nigh!

33:15.894 --> 33:17.696
Come on, she'll get us killed.
Come on!

33:17.729 --> 33:20.765
I curse all of you demon seed!

33:20.799 --> 33:23.568
[screaming]

34:28.600 --> 34:29.601
Hey.

34:34.472 --> 34:36.341
Excuse me, can you help us?

34:36.374 --> 34:37.742
We have a friend...

34:39.110 --> 34:40.478
No, Shelley!

34:40.512 --> 34:42.013
[growling and snarling]

34:42.047 --> 34:43.281
Shelley! Watch out!

34:43.315 --> 34:44.082
Shelley!

34:44.115 --> 34:45.216
No!

34:45.684 --> 34:48.553
[wet thuds]

35:13.678 --> 35:16.648
See? I killed one, too.

35:16.681 --> 35:18.416
I'm okay.

35:25.323 --> 35:26.291
Grab what you can.

35:26.324 --> 35:27.125
Like what?

35:27.158 --> 35:29.728
Anything that will keep
Shona alive.

35:29.761 --> 35:35.700
[phone ringing]

35:35.734 --> 35:36.635
It's Vi.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.436
[laughs]

35:40.372 --> 35:41.239
Vi?

35:41.272 --> 35:42.207
Jack!

35:43.074 --> 35:44.142
Vi, where are you?

35:44.175 --> 35:45.844
Jack. Can you hear me?

35:45.877 --> 35:46.478
Vi, I'm okay.

35:46.511 --> 35:47.746
Where are you?

35:47.779 --> 35:49.848
I'm in a helicopter.

35:49.881 --> 35:53.184
Dad is evacuating us
to a safe location.

35:53.218 --> 35:55.320
He's sending the chopper
to the roof of your hotel.

35:55.353 --> 35:57.355
It's gonna be there
in 20 minutes.

35:57.389 --> 35:58.056
You have to be there!

35:58.089 --> 35:59.391
Vi, we're at the police station.

35:59.424 --> 36:00.325
Send it there.

36:00.358 --> 36:01.292
Did you hear me?

36:01.326 --> 36:03.662
Send the helicopter
to the police station!

36:03.695 --> 36:04.329
(Shelley) Jack! Jack!

36:04.362 --> 36:06.197
(Vi) It's your only shot.

36:06.231 --> 36:07.032
I found what we need.

36:07.065 --> 36:10.035
(Vi) Jack. It's your only shot.

36:10.068 --> 36:10.835
You have to be there!

36:10.869 --> 36:12.437
Can you hear me?

36:12.470 --> 36:13.438
Jack!

36:13.471 --> 36:15.273
We're gonna find a way.

36:15.306 --> 36:16.341
I'll see you soon, okay?

36:16.374 --> 36:18.710
I promise.

36:18.743 --> 36:19.744
[static]

36:19.778 --> 36:21.079
Vi?

36:24.649 --> 36:26.451
We have to go.

36:26.484 --> 36:28.586
Now.

36:32.257 --> 36:33.425
[gunshot]

36:34.592 --> 36:35.727
Brittany!

36:35.760 --> 36:36.528
Brittany!

36:36.561 --> 36:37.696
Shona!

36:39.164 --> 36:39.798
What happened?

36:39.831 --> 36:42.033
Son of a bitch was paranoid.

36:42.067 --> 36:44.803
He thought Shona was infected.

36:44.836 --> 36:47.772
Said he'd kill her
so I took his gun.

36:50.275 --> 36:52.744
You did what you had to do.

36:52.777 --> 36:54.446
Jack, Jack.

36:56.815 --> 36:58.583
She's bleeding so much.

36:58.616 --> 36:59.517
(Shona) No doctor, huh?

36:59.551 --> 37:02.587
No, uh, we couldn't find
a good one so um,

37:02.620 --> 37:05.757
this is all we've got.

37:05.790 --> 37:07.158
It's not gonna be enough.

37:07.192 --> 37:08.760
Put this on and squeeze it.

37:08.793 --> 37:10.328
Or press down as hard
as you can.

37:10.361 --> 37:11.262
Yeah.

37:11.296 --> 37:12.230
Okay.

37:12.263 --> 37:13.031
It's gonna be fine.

37:13.064 --> 37:13.965
We just need to stop
the bleeding

37:13.998 --> 37:16.401
long enough to get you
in the helicopter.

37:16.434 --> 37:17.335
What helicopter?

37:17.368 --> 37:19.704
The one that's gonna get us
out of here.

37:21.206 --> 37:22.507
Okay, come on.

37:22.540 --> 37:23.441
It's okay.

37:23.475 --> 37:24.709
We're gonna wrap this
around you tightly

37:24.743 --> 37:27.278
and it's gonna stop the bleeding
just for a little while, okay?

37:27.312 --> 37:28.480
Just long enough.

37:30.315 --> 37:31.082
We're gonna get you up, okay?

37:31.116 --> 37:32.283
Come on, help us up.

37:32.317 --> 37:33.284
You can do this.

37:33.318 --> 37:34.252
There you go.

37:34.285 --> 37:34.953
Get up.

37:34.986 --> 37:36.287
Up.

37:36.321 --> 37:38.256
Okay.

37:38.289 --> 37:40.291
Here.

37:40.325 --> 37:41.526
Now you're up.

37:41.559 --> 37:43.328
Okay.

37:43.361 --> 37:44.796
There's something
wrong with Shona.

37:44.829 --> 37:47.465
Jack, what's going on?
What's happening?

37:47.499 --> 37:48.867
I don't know... um...

37:48.900 --> 37:49.701
I'll get behind her.

37:49.734 --> 37:50.635
Come on.

37:50.668 --> 37:53.338
Shona, no. Come on, Shona.
You got this.

37:53.371 --> 37:54.539
Okay, come here.

37:54.572 --> 37:56.307
It's okay, babe. It's okay.

37:56.341 --> 37:57.275
I got you. It's okay.

37:57.308 --> 37:58.476
Keep pressing.
Keep pressing.

37:58.510 --> 37:59.310
I am.

37:59.344 --> 38:00.645
‐She's losing a lot.
‐I am. I know.

38:00.678 --> 38:01.513
Come on. Come on.

38:01.546 --> 38:02.380
I know.

38:02.413 --> 38:04.482
Just breathe. Just breathe.
Come on.

38:04.516 --> 38:05.817
Hold her still.
Hold her still.

38:05.850 --> 38:06.651
I'm trying.

38:06.684 --> 38:07.886
Hold her still. Come on.

38:07.919 --> 38:10.321
Come on. Hold her still.

38:12.924 --> 38:14.392
Come on, Shona.

38:14.425 --> 38:15.360
Come on.

38:15.393 --> 38:16.394
Come on.

38:25.503 --> 38:26.704

Come on.

38:36.381 --> 38:38.316
Jack. Jack.

38:38.349 --> 38:42.654
[helicopter whirring]

38:42.687 --> 38:44.656
No, no.

38:44.689 --> 38:46.691
Um... It's okay.

38:46.724 --> 38:50.461
We did‐ we did everything.

39:01.940 --> 39:03.408
We're almost there!

39:08.479 --> 39:10.348
They're coming.

39:13.885 --> 39:17.522
We have to stand our ground
and fight them.

39:17.555 --> 39:19.991
It's the only way we can get
to the roof.

39:21.092 --> 39:23.394
How many bullets
do you have?

39:23.995 --> 39:24.863
How many?!

39:24.896 --> 39:25.930
Two.

39:25.964 --> 39:27.365
Be calm.

39:27.398 --> 39:29.400
Make them count.

39:33.438 --> 39:36.708
[growling and snarling]

39:38.443 --> 39:39.777
It's all or nothing.

39:41.012 --> 39:42.413
[gunshots]

39:45.683 --> 39:48.453
[grunts]

39:51.789 --> 39:53.524
[screaming]

40:00.331 --> 40:01.432
Brittany!

40:15.046 --> 40:16.915
[loud scream]

40:16.948 --> 40:18.449
Shelley!

40:18.483 --> 40:19.350
Shelley!

40:19.384 --> 40:21.653
[loud scream]

40:30.528 --> 40:32.931
Jacqueline, get to the roof.

40:35.366 --> 40:40.939
[growling and snarling]

40:43.174 --> 40:45.043
Shelley, come on!

40:45.076 --> 40:45.843
Let's go!

40:48.579 --> 40:50.448
Shelley, hurry!
We're almost there.

40:51.582 --> 40:55.486
[helicopter whirring]

40:55.520 --> 40:56.654
No!

40:58.556 --> 41:00.458
No!!!

41:00.491 --> 41:04.062
[sobbing]

41:04.095 --> 41:05.930
Shit!

41:09.600 --> 41:10.635
Hey.

41:10.668 --> 41:11.803
Jack, hey.

41:11.836 --> 41:12.804

41:12.837 --> 41:14.138
Hey.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.007
Hey.

41:16.040 --> 41:17.675
I just want to make sure
you got out.

41:17.709 --> 41:18.743
What happened?

41:18.776 --> 41:20.645
What happened?

41:24.549 --> 41:25.583
You've been bit.

41:25.616 --> 41:27.719
[sobbing]

41:29.020 --> 41:31.856
I just‐I can't be one of those
things 'cause uh,

41:31.889 --> 41:34.192
I won't let it happen, okay?

41:34.225 --> 41:37.729
But you need to stay safe
and um,

41:37.762 --> 41:41.032
god, you're always
the strong one.

41:41.065 --> 41:43.901
I love you so much.

41:50.708 --> 41:54.979
I don't want to hurt you!
I don't want to hurt you!

41:55.913 --> 41:58.950
[screeching]

41:58.983 --> 42:00.051
Shelley?

42:00.084 --> 42:00.952
Shelley?

42:00.985 --> 42:03.154
Shelley, no!

42:10.161 --> 42:19.971
[sobbing]

42:23.941 --> 42:32.116
[sirens wailing in the distance

42:38.856 --> 42:43.795
[screams and continues
to sob hysterically]
