<i>It's Jess. Leave a message.</i>

02:05.410 --> 02:07.810
<i>The mailbox is full</i>

02:07.812 --> 02:10.044
<i>and cannot accept any

02:10.047 --> 02:12.346
<i>Good-bye.</i>

02:30.768 --> 02:32.634
<i>Hello?</i>

02:32.636 --> 02:35.805
Is this Sara Price?
I am with the Yamanashi Police.

02:35.807 --> 02:38.007
<i>The school where
your sister teaches,</i>

02:38.009 --> 02:41.742
<i>they've filed a missing
persons report with us.</i>

02:43.782 --> 02:47.483
Look, Jess has done this
before. I'm sure she's okay.

02:47.485 --> 02:51.718
The last time I talked
to her she sounded... off.

02:52.588 --> 02:54.657
Hey. You know Jess.

02:54.659 --> 02:57.827
Everything's great. Then it's terrible.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.794
No, it wasn't just a bad mood.

03:02.065 --> 03:04.866
Okay, look, let's forget about dinner.

03:04.868 --> 03:07.736
- I'll take them to a restaurant.
- No.

03:07.738 --> 03:12.474
It's your boss. We're going to
impress her. I'll be fine. I promise.

03:15.146 --> 03:17.746
<i>Sara, it is nice
to finally meet you.</i>

03:17.748 --> 03:20.547
Baby, are you okay?

03:23.121 --> 03:24.954
<i>I don't understand.</i>

03:24.956 --> 03:28.090
If you know she went there, why
aren't you already looking for her?

03:28.092 --> 03:31.693
<i>Your sister
was last seen in Aokigahara Forest.</i>

03:31.695 --> 03:34.864
<i>I'm sorry to say this, but it is a
place where some people commit suicide.</i>

03:34.866 --> 03:36.665
What?

03:36.667 --> 03:39.869
<i>She was seen leaving the path
to go into the forest alone.</i>

03:39.871 --> 03:42.138
<i>When we see this,</i>

03:42.140 --> 03:46.307
<i>it means the person does
not want to be found.</i>

03:53.485 --> 03:56.518
Miss? Are you there?

03:57.688 --> 03:59.121
I'm here.

03:59.123 --> 04:01.257
<i>After 48 hours</i>

04:01.259 --> 04:04.259
<i>we have to assume a person has gone
through with their suicide plan.</i>

04:04.261 --> 04:06.593
No, she's alive.

04:11.603 --> 04:14.002
What's going on?

04:14.004 --> 04:16.935
I'm going to Japan. The
police think Jess is dead.

04:17.608 --> 04:19.740
<i>What?</i>

04:21.144 --> 04:24.179
Apparently, they have a forest in
Japan where people go to kill themselves

04:24.181 --> 04:26.114
and Jess went into it.

04:26.116 --> 04:30.484
Sounds like exactly the kind of place
your sister would go hiking for fun.

04:33.123 --> 04:35.791
Rob, she's my twin,

04:35.793 --> 04:38.727
she's in trouble and she needs me.

04:38.729 --> 04:41.030
She always needs you.

04:41.032 --> 04:45.300
She makes a bad decision
and you clean up her mess.

04:46.671 --> 04:50.703
<i>I don't know, Rob. It
feels different this time.</i>

04:51.543 --> 04:53.075
<i>It's your call.</i>

04:53.077 --> 04:55.544
Why don't you just sleep on it, okay?

04:55.546 --> 04:57.978
If she doesn't call you
by morning, reassess.

04:57.981 --> 05:01.284
If you still want to go, you can go. Okay?

05:01.286 --> 05:03.318
- Okay.
- Okay. All right.

05:03.320 --> 05:05.655
- I love you.
- I love you too.

05:05.657 --> 05:09.623
It's gonna be all right.
Everything's gonna be fine.

06:31.676 --> 06:34.943
You wouldn't happen to have
a dead one, would you?

06:34.945 --> 06:38.312
Okay.

06:53.830 --> 06:58.034

08:26.323 --> 08:32.058

09:45.869 --> 09:50.405
- On a longboat.
- I went on a longboat.

09:50.407 --> 09:53.342
I am going on a longboat.

09:53.344 --> 09:57.413
I am going on a longboat.

09:57.415 --> 10:00.281
I will go on a longboat.

10:00.283 --> 10:03.419
I will go on a longboat.

10:03.421 --> 10:05.620
He went to London.

10:05.623 --> 10:07.990
He went to London.

10:07.992 --> 10:10.358
He is going to London.

10:10.360 --> 10:14.094
He is going to London.

10:34.118 --> 10:36.684
She thought you were Miss Jess.

10:36.954 --> 10:39.454
- She's ashamed.
- We're twins.

10:39.456 --> 10:41.890
I am... sorry.

10:41.892 --> 10:43.391
It's okay.

10:43.393 --> 10:46.793
But why were you scared?

10:59.410 --> 11:04.211
She knows your sister went into Aokigahara.

11:05.016 --> 11:09.083
She thought you were a
<i>yurei.</i> A ghost.

11:11.221 --> 11:14.956
Aokigahara. Th-The suicide forest?

11:14.959 --> 11:18.726
In old times it was a
place for <i>ubasute.</i>

11:19.195 --> 11:21.530
When there was not enough food,

11:21.532 --> 11:24.132
families would bring elderly women,

11:24.134 --> 11:27.068
the blind or sick to the forest

11:27.070 --> 11:29.471
and leave them to die.

11:29.473 --> 11:31.506
That's awful. I don't understand.

11:31.508 --> 11:34.009
Why would the school
take a class trip there?

11:34.011 --> 11:37.145
Mount Fuji is very beautiful
and important to history.

11:37.147 --> 11:40.549
Aokigahara is simply part of the mountain.

11:48.591 --> 11:52.060
People say spirits cannot rest there.

11:52.062 --> 11:53.996
They come back.

11:59.036 --> 12:00.703
Angry.

12:00.705 --> 12:03.137
They come back angry.

12:03.139 --> 12:06.740
<i>Hai.</i>

12:07.511 --> 12:09.643
<i>Hai.</i>

12:11.681 --> 12:14.681
Can I see Jess's room before I go?

12:15.085 --> 12:16.815
<i>Hai.</i>

12:20.157 --> 12:23.525
Normally I would respect privacy,

12:23.527 --> 12:26.291
but because you're family...

12:28.398 --> 12:30.295
Thank you.

12:52.089 --> 12:54.689
Jess, do you have the packing tape?

12:54.691 --> 12:59.226
- Hey. Those could be worth something.
- They're from the Stone Age.

12:59.228 --> 13:01.730
Didn't Grandma say they
were collectors items?

13:01.732 --> 13:04.098
She also said Rob was gay 'cause
he parted his hair to the right.

13:04.100 --> 13:06.300
Point taken.

13:07.171 --> 13:09.505
Be careful with that jar.

13:09.507 --> 13:13.338
- Why? She keep her stash in it?
- She kept Grandpa in it.

13:19.450 --> 13:21.916
<i>You're terrible.</i>

14:10.434 --> 14:13.334
<i>So, when was the
last time you saw Grandma?</i>

14:14.238 --> 14:16.401
Six months ago.

14:16.674 --> 14:18.439
I feel bad.

14:18.441 --> 14:22.243
We just abandoned her, went
off to do our own thing.

14:22.245 --> 14:24.678
She understood. We
needed to start our lives.

14:24.681 --> 14:28.283
I'm about to start mine all over again.

14:28.285 --> 14:32.019
I'm sure it'll be great,
Jess. I'm proud of you.

14:32.790 --> 14:35.723
Tokyo isn't exactly the next town over.

14:35.725 --> 14:38.126
It'll be good for you.

14:38.128 --> 14:40.862
Plus, it'll give me an excuse to
get on a plane every once in a while.

14:40.864 --> 14:43.061
You'd better.

16:07.383 --> 16:09.583
- <i>Konnichiwa.</i>
- Hi.

16:09.585 --> 16:11.486
I'm, uh...

16:11.488 --> 16:13.422
I'm looking for my sister.

16:13.424 --> 16:16.824
She came here on a trip with
her school and disappeared.

16:16.826 --> 16:19.627
- Have you seen her?
- Yes. We find.

16:19.629 --> 16:21.461
You... You found Jess?

16:21.831 --> 16:23.698
Oh, my... Wh-Where is she?

16:23.700 --> 16:25.701
She here. I take you.

16:25.703 --> 16:28.936
Sakura.

16:30.273 --> 16:34.007
I...

16:42.853 --> 16:45.083
What is this?

16:46.389 --> 16:48.454
Basement.

16:57.368 --> 16:59.199
You come?

17:14.318 --> 17:16.518
Keep the bodies here when we find.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.053
- Keep them cold.
- The bodies?

17:19.055 --> 17:21.789
Someone stay with them at all time.

17:21.790 --> 17:25.760
If bodies alone, the
spirit scream all night.

17:59.396 --> 18:00.928
Sorry. Two second.

18:00.930 --> 18:03.596
You wait.

18:56.587 --> 18:58.453
- It's not her.
- No?

18:58.455 --> 19:00.888
- It's not her.
- Good. Good news.

19:00.890 --> 19:03.825
Is there someone who could
help me search the forest?

19:03.827 --> 19:07.561
The forest is very dangerous.
Do not leave the path.

19:07.563 --> 19:09.097
- Can get lost.
- I understand.

19:09.099 --> 19:12.031
- What if I want to hire a guide?
- No guide. Come back.

19:12.034 --> 19:14.135
- Maybe more bodies.
- No.

19:14.137 --> 19:16.605
She's lost. She's not dead.

19:16.607 --> 19:20.339
Do not leave the path.

19:29.019 --> 19:31.285
Shit.

19:36.726 --> 19:39.627
Hey. It's mountain.

19:39.629 --> 19:42.728
Lots of metal. Cell
phone do not work up here.

19:43.533 --> 19:45.934
Do you know the forest?

19:45.936 --> 19:48.670
Could you take me in? I'd pay you.

19:48.672 --> 19:51.605
The forest has <i>yurei.</i>
Everybody know that.

19:51.608 --> 19:53.074
<i>Yurei.</i>

19:53.076 --> 19:55.210
You mean ghosts?

19:55.212 --> 19:56.877
<i>Yurei.</i>

19:56.879 --> 19:59.481
Different from ghost.

19:59.483 --> 20:01.916
The forest use them to trick you.

20:01.918 --> 20:05.350
Do you know why "do not leave the path"?

20:05.722 --> 20:07.722
Because if you get lost

20:07.724 --> 20:10.691
and you have sadness in your heart,

20:11.061 --> 20:13.194
they will use it against you.

20:13.196 --> 20:15.196
<i>Yurei</i> come find you

20:15.198 --> 20:17.598
and make you see things

20:17.600 --> 20:20.167
and make you want to die.

20:20.169 --> 20:22.971
And you do it yourself.

20:22.973 --> 20:25.305
Okay.

20:26.076 --> 20:28.577
Thanks for that.

20:28.579 --> 20:31.811
If the <i>yurei</i> are looking
for me, I'll be at my hotel.

21:39.015 --> 21:41.614
Thanks.

21:46.689 --> 21:48.789
You look familiar. Have we met?

21:48.791 --> 21:51.325
Here? Four days ago?

21:51.994 --> 21:53.993
Uh, hey, sorry.

21:53.996 --> 21:57.164
I don't know you. I was
just a line to start a chat.

21:57.166 --> 22:00.234
"Have you ever been to Greece? Did you go
to Camp Minnehaha in the Rocky Mountains?"

22:00.236 --> 22:02.902
- That kind of thing.
- Right.

22:03.941 --> 22:06.875
I thought you might
have met my sister, Jess.

22:06.877 --> 22:10.344
She came here... and disappeared.

22:10.913 --> 22:13.011
Do you know about the forest?

22:13.149 --> 22:14.616
Yeah.

22:14.618 --> 22:16.952
Is that a possibility with your sister?

22:16.954 --> 22:20.752
We're identical twins. If she
were dead, I would just know.

22:23.260 --> 22:27.761
What do you think she's up
to then, if she's out there?

22:28.764 --> 22:32.531
I think she's struggling with her demons.

22:33.169 --> 22:35.300
Yeah, it happens.

22:36.673 --> 22:41.708
Some people go in. They do sort
of a walkabout, think it over.

22:42.244 --> 22:44.844
Sometimes they come back out again.

22:46.249 --> 22:47.781
I'm Aiden, by the way.

22:47.783 --> 22:51.385
Oh. Sara.

22:51.687 --> 22:53.288
Sara. Pleasure to meet you.

22:53.290 --> 22:55.622
You too.

22:59.963 --> 23:02.595
That's her, a couple of years ago.

23:04.301 --> 23:07.533
- Same, right?
- Identical.

23:08.205 --> 23:11.672
Uh...

23:13.042 --> 23:15.876
Sisters.

23:15.878 --> 23:17.978
- No.
- No, he's never seen her.

23:17.981 --> 23:19.914
Are you fluent?

23:19.916 --> 23:24.417
Yeah. I live in Tokyo. I write for
a travel magazine out of Australia.

23:26.889 --> 23:29.190
- So, did you?
- Huh?

23:29.192 --> 23:31.693
Go to Camp Minnehaha
in the Rocky Mountains?

23:31.695 --> 23:33.260
No.

23:33.262 --> 23:36.931
No, I was lucky. I... I went to space camp.

23:36.933 --> 23:38.899
- Oh, space camp.
- Yeah. Lots of fun.

23:40.670 --> 23:43.704
- All alone?
- Yeah.

23:43.706 --> 23:46.340
- What?
- No.

23:46.342 --> 23:48.309
- What?
- No, you'll get lost.

23:48.311 --> 23:50.211
Trust me.

23:50.213 --> 23:53.181
Trust me. You will. I've been
in the forest a hundred times.

23:53.183 --> 23:56.216
<i>I</i> don't go in alone.
I can't let you do that.

23:56.218 --> 23:59.788
Well, good thing I don't need
your permission, guy I just met.

23:59.790 --> 24:03.258
I have clearance to go with the park
nature guard tomorrow for my article.

24:03.260 --> 24:06.360
He goes on rounds every few
days, kinda like a suicide watch.

24:06.362 --> 24:09.230
He knows the park better than
anyone. I could ask if you could come.

24:09.232 --> 24:11.965
- That would be great.
- One thing though. A favor, if you wouldn't mind.

24:11.967 --> 24:13.902
Yeah?

24:13.904 --> 24:17.739
Your search for your sister,
it's gripping, it's human.

24:17.741 --> 24:19.406
- I mean, it's an article.
- Oh.

24:19.408 --> 24:22.343
- I'd like your permission to write about it.
- Right.

24:22.345 --> 24:24.445
Will I be a celebrity in Australia?

24:24.447 --> 24:26.946
- Do you want to be a celebrity in Australia?
- Nope.

24:26.948 --> 24:29.316
Are you sure? You might
like it. You never know.

24:29.319 --> 24:32.787
Is it all right if I record you for the
story? For my own notes, for accuracy?

24:32.789 --> 24:35.155
- Uh-huh.
- You have to say "yes" out loud.

24:35.157 --> 24:36.857
"Yes out loud."

24:36.859 --> 24:38.760
Thank you.

24:38.762 --> 24:42.163
So you and Jess were
raised by your grandmother.

24:42.165 --> 24:46.233
And you believe she's okay because you
have this kind of mystical twin connection.

24:46.235 --> 24:48.103
It's not mystical.

24:48.105 --> 24:51.740
It's just when something happens to
one of us, the other one can tell.

24:51.742 --> 24:55.175
I mean, usually it's something happening to
her and me coming to bail her out, but...

24:55.177 --> 24:57.177
Yeah. I've got a little brother myself.

24:57.179 --> 25:00.815
He's a good kid. Just, he can't
seem to stay out of trouble.

25:00.817 --> 25:05.119
Jess is the same. She never learns.

25:05.121 --> 25:08.889
When we were little, no
one could tell us apart.

25:08.891 --> 25:12.991
It was like we were the same person.

25:13.896 --> 25:16.897
Do you mind if I ask what
happened to your parents?

25:16.899 --> 25:19.532
No, it's totally fine.

25:20.436 --> 25:23.104
It was a car accident. We were six.

25:23.106 --> 25:26.508
They had gone to a movie. Grandma
was over. She was watching us.

25:26.510 --> 25:28.876
What is wrong with you?

25:28.878 --> 25:32.011
Put that
down. You're scaring me!

25:32.014 --> 25:36.184
They were supposed to be back any
minute. We heard this crash outside.

25:46.830 --> 25:49.963
Grandma rushed outside. We followed her.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.567
It was a drunk driver.

25:53.569 --> 25:57.137
<i>He'd been doing 60 in a
residential neighborhood.</i>

25:57.139 --> 25:59.507
<i>Hit them right as they
turned into the driveway.</i>

25:59.509 --> 26:02.976
Jess was in front of me. She saw it first.

26:06.282 --> 26:09.648
Jess told me later their bodies
were right there on the lawn.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.520
Close your eyes!

26:12.522 --> 26:15.490
Don't look! Don't look!

26:17.293 --> 26:21.059
I kept my eyes closed, but she saw it all.

26:23.232 --> 26:25.165
Jesus.

26:26.368 --> 26:28.368
- Did they ever catch the guy?
- What guy?

26:28.370 --> 26:32.605
- The... The drunk driver?
- Oh, no. No.

26:35.212 --> 26:38.078
Hey. I'm sorry. I didn't mean
to dredge all that stuff up.

26:38.080 --> 26:41.146
Oh, it's fine. Long time ago.

26:43.587 --> 26:47.087
- Mmm. Cheers.
- Cheers.

27:13.281 --> 27:16.016
<i>Hi. This is Rob. Sorry I
can't get to the phone.</i>

27:16.019 --> 27:18.117
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

27:19.089 --> 27:21.253
Fine.

28:38.968 --> 28:41.301
Sorry.

28:41.303 --> 28:43.669
She's elderly.

29:19.743 --> 29:22.410
<i>Hey, babe. I got your message.</i>

29:22.412 --> 29:24.779
<i>It's nice to finally hear
your voice. I miss you.</i>

29:24.781 --> 29:29.082
<i>But you going into this forest
alone, it sounds really dangerous.</i>

29:29.084 --> 29:32.220
<i>If I don't hear back from you
soon, I am hopping on a plane.</i>

29:32.222 --> 29:34.319
<i>So just come home. Please.</i>

29:42.331 --> 29:43.498
- Morning.
- Morning.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.366
Michi, this is Sara.

29:45.368 --> 29:48.301
Hello. Thanks for this.

29:48.303 --> 29:50.538
Michi does these suicide
watch hikes off the books.

29:50.540 --> 29:53.473
That's very good of you.

29:54.077 --> 29:56.076
What?

29:56.378 --> 29:58.345
You must understand,

29:58.348 --> 30:00.514
after this long

30:00.516 --> 30:03.785
most people who go into the
forest to die are already dead.

30:03.787 --> 30:05.718
She's not dead.

30:07.724 --> 30:10.088
Do you have family?

30:10.259 --> 30:12.126
- I have children.
- Okay.

30:12.128 --> 30:14.761
If this was your child,

30:15.197 --> 30:18.464
if you knew she was lost and in pain,

30:19.368 --> 30:22.569
you'd do anything to help, wouldn't you?

30:22.571 --> 30:25.205
I can't prove to you that I'm right.

30:25.207 --> 30:28.209
All I can do is ask you to
understand where I'm coming from.

30:28.211 --> 30:30.177
- I still think you should not go.
- Why?

30:30.179 --> 30:33.112
Because you're sad.

30:54.270 --> 30:57.237
- Okay?
- Let's go.

31:10.619 --> 31:14.489
<i>Jukai</i> means "sea of trees."

31:14.491 --> 31:16.624
If you look down from Mount Fuji,

31:16.626 --> 31:19.192
the forest looks like an ocean.

31:21.130 --> 31:24.197
There's ice caves beneath the forest.

31:24.199 --> 31:26.733
There's whole sections that
have never been explored.

31:26.735 --> 31:30.334
Some people believe it's a
gateway to the other side.

32:20.423 --> 32:23.020
Sara!

32:28.764 --> 32:31.164
Take a look at this.

32:32.635 --> 32:35.802
Okay, that's weird. Why is that happening?

32:35.804 --> 32:37.837
Iron deposits in the
mountain. It's crazy, huh?

32:37.839 --> 32:40.439
- Yeah.
- Look.

32:41.410 --> 32:44.612
People sometimes see things in the forest.

32:44.614 --> 32:46.280
Important to remember.

32:46.282 --> 32:50.785
If you see anything bad, anything strange,

32:50.787 --> 32:53.152
it is not real.

32:53.356 --> 32:56.122
Okay? It's not there.

32:56.592 --> 32:58.657
It's here.

33:25.021 --> 33:27.420
- Watch out.
- I got it.

34:08.731 --> 34:11.063
Let's head this way.

34:42.030 --> 34:44.328
What's that?

34:45.702 --> 34:48.568
If you bring a tent, you're not sure.

34:49.438 --> 34:51.536
Stay here.

35:06.588 --> 35:10.255
What will you do if we
don't find your sister today?

35:14.430 --> 35:16.596
Try again tomorrow.

35:18.066 --> 35:21.133
What if we don't find her tomorrow?

35:28.778 --> 35:32.613
How does it feel to be in the
forest where she disappeared?

35:32.615 --> 35:34.714
It feels...

35:35.917 --> 35:38.151
necessary.

35:47.863 --> 35:51.363
Jess ever tried suicide before?

35:54.704 --> 35:57.004
She was living in Florida a few years ago

35:57.006 --> 35:59.140
and one night she wasn't
picking up the phone.

35:59.142 --> 36:01.174
I just knew something was wrong.

36:01.176 --> 36:03.743
I got 911 to check on her.

36:03.745 --> 36:06.881
They found her unconscious.
She'd taken some sleeping pills.

36:06.883 --> 36:09.716
That was the second time.
First time was back in college.

36:09.718 --> 36:12.050
- Pills then too?
- Mm-hmm.

36:12.053 --> 36:15.856
I mean, knowing Jess, she probably
just thought it was romantic,

36:15.858 --> 36:19.727
following in the footsteps
of her favorite poet.

36:19.729 --> 36:22.162
"Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,"

36:22.164 --> 36:24.198
if mankind perished utterly.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.965
"And Spring herself..."

36:25.967 --> 36:30.536
"When she woke at dawn, would
scarcely know that we were gone."

36:31.441 --> 36:34.974
Now, what's a guy like you
memorize Sara Teasdale for?

36:37.612 --> 36:40.613
Meet a lot of girls on
their junior year abroad?

36:40.615 --> 36:42.713
Whatever works.

36:46.521 --> 36:48.620
Hey, Michi, what happened?

36:51.026 --> 36:54.493
He will be okay, I think.

36:54.664 --> 36:56.728
Let's go.

37:13.548 --> 37:14.881
What's that?

37:14.883 --> 37:17.718
People use tape or rope like this

37:17.720 --> 37:20.086
if they think they might want
to find their way back out.

37:20.088 --> 37:22.689
Or they hope somebody will follow the rope

37:22.691 --> 37:26.224
to remove their body
from the forest one day.

37:28.997 --> 37:31.530
This one looks recent.

37:49.919 --> 37:53.886
Doesn't look like anyone's
here. Maybe they changed their mind.

38:05.600 --> 38:07.699
I must cut him down.

38:07.702 --> 38:10.104
- I'll make a note of where he is.
- Why?

38:10.106 --> 38:13.406
So the rangers can retrieve the body.

39:01.256 --> 39:04.789
Michi.

39:05.193 --> 39:08.793
Take a break.

39:50.772 --> 39:53.039
<i>Help me.</i>

40:02.349 --> 40:04.483
Can we go this way?

40:07.823 --> 40:10.955
I mean, if we're just picking a direction.

40:22.872 --> 40:24.970
Come.

40:28.843 --> 40:30.943
Jess!

40:32.914 --> 40:35.046
Jess!

40:39.187 --> 40:41.753
We must turn back soon.

40:41.756 --> 40:43.289
What, already?

40:43.291 --> 40:45.325
We're several hours from the trail.

40:45.327 --> 40:48.062
We do not stay in the forest after dark.

40:48.064 --> 40:50.164
In the day, easy to get lost.

40:50.166 --> 40:55.968
At night, you're blind and
temperature drops quickly.

40:58.140 --> 41:00.405
Jess!

41:02.278 --> 41:04.743
Do you see something?

41:06.115 --> 41:08.147
Oh, my God, that's her tent.

41:08.149 --> 41:11.084
Jess! Jess!

41:11.086 --> 41:14.152
I knew it! Jess!

41:16.792 --> 41:20.093
It's her! It is! It's her! Oh, my God.

41:20.095 --> 41:24.629
Michi, you said if they bring a
tent, it means they're not sure.

41:25.200 --> 41:27.868
Oh, my God, she's close. She's so close.

41:27.870 --> 41:30.770
- Jess! Jess!
- Jess!

41:31.474 --> 41:33.906
Jess!

41:35.044 --> 41:36.477
Jess? Hello!

41:36.479 --> 41:38.844
Hello?

41:42.983 --> 41:46.185
Since she's not here, we'll
come back tomorrow morning.

41:46.187 --> 41:48.287
- We must go now.
- We've got to stay.

41:48.289 --> 41:51.258
We must go now. You can
leave a note for her.

41:51.260 --> 41:54.327
Leave a note? Are you crazy? I'm
staying. I'm staying till she comes back.

41:54.329 --> 41:56.229
Aiden, tell him.

41:56.231 --> 41:58.364
No, he's right.

41:58.367 --> 42:00.399
- We can come back tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

42:00.401 --> 42:02.367
No, tomorrow is gonna be too late.

42:02.370 --> 42:06.005
She left the tent. She's gonna come back
to sleep. Her clothes are on the line.

42:06.008 --> 42:07.473
Sleeping here is foolish.

42:07.475 --> 42:10.410
We'll not stop looking
for Jess... in the daytime.

42:10.412 --> 42:12.944
Now we must go.

42:13.515 --> 42:15.814
I understand.

42:16.417 --> 42:18.883
You two go. Go.

42:19.789 --> 42:21.789
It's all right. I understand. You go.

42:21.791 --> 42:24.258
You cannot stay!

42:24.260 --> 42:27.995
At night in the <i>jukai,</i>
people see bad things.

42:27.997 --> 42:31.297
Sometimes <i>do</i> bad
things. Very bad things.

42:31.299 --> 42:34.468
The forest draws out
your fear, your sadness.

42:34.470 --> 42:38.071
You believe in <i>yurei,</i> Michi? You sound
like the girl from the visitor center.

42:38.073 --> 42:40.940
I came 6,000 miles to find my sister.

42:40.942 --> 42:44.309
She's here in these woods.
I'm not leaving without her.

42:44.311 --> 42:46.546
Thanks for your help.

42:46.548 --> 42:49.249
I'm so grateful. Really.

42:49.251 --> 42:51.716
But I'm staying.

42:55.957 --> 42:58.523
Sara, you're making a big mistake.

43:21.249 --> 43:24.983
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna stay here with you.

43:24.985 --> 43:27.220
- Don't be foolish, Aiden.
- It's fine.

43:27.222 --> 43:29.589
We'll stay here. We'll stay the
night. We'll watch after each other.

43:29.591 --> 43:33.227
Hey.

43:33.229 --> 43:35.229
- We'll be fine.
- I'll come back tomorrow.

43:35.231 --> 43:37.763
Do not move from here. Okay?

43:44.974 --> 43:48.140
You don't have to do this.
It's my sister, not yours.

43:48.142 --> 43:51.776
Yeah, well, if it was my
brother, I'd stick around too.

43:53.983 --> 43:56.048
Thanks.

44:13.968 --> 44:16.936
I changed my mind. Let's
come back in the morning.

44:16.938 --> 44:19.138
Yeah. Very funny.

44:19.140 --> 44:22.206
Here. Give me a hand with this fire.

44:27.483 --> 44:30.517
No, not like that. Here. Like this.

44:30.519 --> 44:33.452
Like you're the expert.
You went to space camp.

44:33.454 --> 44:37.056
I know you're not supposed to pile it
up like that. You gotta let it breathe.

44:37.059 --> 44:39.059
Okay. You mean up, like this?

44:39.061 --> 44:41.428
- Yeah. There you go.
- Okay.

44:41.430 --> 44:44.863
I salute your caveman skills.

44:47.969 --> 44:49.937
- Want one?
- What's this?

44:49.939 --> 44:52.971
A Power Bar. Japanese version.

44:53.374 --> 44:55.673
They're pretty good.

45:04.153 --> 45:05.984
It's not bad.

45:09.524 --> 45:13.093
You take the tent when you get tired.

45:13.095 --> 45:15.660
I'll stay out here by the fire.

45:16.332 --> 45:18.964
Avoid any awkwardness.

45:19.702 --> 45:22.401
A caveman <i>and</i> a gentleman.

45:48.463 --> 45:51.662
- What's that?
- I don't know.

45:52.401 --> 45:54.600
But I promise you they
have centipedes in Australia

45:54.602 --> 45:57.269
more dangerous than anything out here.

46:04.379 --> 46:07.045
Jess must be lost.

46:09.417 --> 46:11.450
She's close.

46:11.787 --> 46:14.052
And alive.

46:15.390 --> 46:17.688
Explain that to me.

46:18.059 --> 46:20.425
It's like a sound.

46:20.428 --> 46:24.061
It's too low to hear, but I can just...

46:24.566 --> 46:26.665
feel it...

46:26.667 --> 46:28.535
running through me.

46:28.537 --> 46:31.704
And that night I was telling
you about, when she almost died,

46:31.707 --> 46:33.972
the sound dropped away.

46:34.475 --> 46:36.443
Where Jess had been,

46:36.445 --> 46:38.810
there was just...

46:39.714 --> 46:42.013
silence.

46:44.787 --> 46:49.721
You know, when we were kids,
my brother would start fights.

46:50.258 --> 46:52.191
And I never stepped in.

46:52.193 --> 46:55.359
Figured he needed to learn not
to start them in the first place.

46:56.397 --> 46:58.198
One day he got beat up so bad

46:58.200 --> 47:00.434
that it left him deaf in his left ear.

47:00.436 --> 47:05.104
And I remember seeing him,
and that feeling... just guilt.

47:05.106 --> 47:07.772
So now whenever he's in
trouble, I come running.

47:08.510 --> 47:11.643
- I feel guilty too.
- What do you mean?

47:11.645 --> 47:13.580
My parents' bodies.

47:13.582 --> 47:16.281
I closed my eyes, but she looked.

47:18.153 --> 47:21.153
It's always been the difference between us.

47:21.155 --> 47:24.021
She looks at the dark
stuff and I turn away.

47:24.559 --> 47:26.827
What she saw,

47:26.829 --> 47:29.361
she carried that all by herself.

47:29.363 --> 47:32.129
I should have shared it with her.

47:32.733 --> 47:36.033
That's why I come running.

47:41.510 --> 47:44.243
I'm going to try and get some sleep.

47:44.245 --> 47:46.310
Yeah.

49:03.825 --> 49:06.091
Aiden?

49:07.863 --> 49:10.495
Aiden, say something.

50:54.503 --> 50:56.568
Hello?

50:59.807 --> 51:02.306
Jess, is that you?

51:15.322 --> 51:17.488
Hey, wait.

51:20.461 --> 51:22.028
Wait.

51:22.030 --> 51:24.363
Please!

51:39.513 --> 51:41.579
Hi.

51:42.883 --> 51:45.117
Do you speak English?

51:50.024 --> 51:52.023
Little.

51:53.662 --> 51:54.961
Hoshiko.

51:54.963 --> 51:58.662
Hoshiko, are you alone?

51:59.867 --> 52:01.468
You're cold. Let me help you.

52:01.470 --> 52:03.535
You Sara?

52:04.405 --> 52:06.604
Yeah. How do you know my name?

52:08.977 --> 52:11.542
No trust him.

52:11.979 --> 52:13.711
Who?

52:13.814 --> 52:15.615
Miss Jess know him.

52:15.617 --> 52:17.682
Jess? Is Jess your teacher?

52:18.954 --> 52:21.720
I find her here.

52:22.490 --> 52:25.825
She say, "Need your help."

52:25.827 --> 52:30.129
- Where is she?
- No trust him.

52:30.131 --> 52:32.131
Sara!

52:32.133 --> 52:34.800
No, no, no, no! Wait!

52:38.774 --> 52:40.839
Goddamn it.

52:46.013 --> 52:48.180
I lost her. I lost her.

52:48.182 --> 52:50.417
- Jesus. Look at your hand.
- Oh, God.

52:50.419 --> 52:52.785
Who? Who'd you lose? Jess?

52:52.787 --> 52:55.187
No, it was...

52:55.189 --> 52:57.688
It was a teenage girl. She said...

52:57.690 --> 52:59.723
She said what?

52:59.961 --> 53:02.427
Something in Japanese.

53:02.430 --> 53:04.097
Oh, man.

53:04.099 --> 53:05.731
Well, we're not gonna find her

53:05.733 --> 53:07.133
if she doesn't wanna be found.

53:07.135 --> 53:09.533
We'll tell Michi.

53:10.671 --> 53:13.772
Okay, let's get back before
we get turned around. Come on.

53:16.044 --> 53:18.310
Come on.

53:25.954 --> 53:27.886
All right, kiddo. There's
enough light for us now.

53:27.888 --> 53:29.689
Let's get you out of here.

53:29.691 --> 53:32.724
- But Michi said noon.
- Seven hours from now?

53:32.727 --> 53:34.726
No. Look at your hand. You need stitches.

53:34.729 --> 53:37.196
Let me worry about my hand.

53:37.198 --> 53:39.530
Jess might still come back.

53:44.638 --> 53:46.539
Sara.

53:46.541 --> 53:49.241
You just saw a child out in the woods
presumably contemplating suicide,

53:49.243 --> 53:51.176
considering that she ran from you.

53:51.178 --> 53:54.046
We tell them that, they'll
send a search party quick.

53:54.048 --> 53:58.249
Maybe that search party
finds your sister. Make sense?

54:00.856 --> 54:02.722
In the meantime,

54:02.724 --> 54:05.557
in case your sister does
come back while we're gone,

54:05.559 --> 54:07.894
you do what you should've done yesterday.

54:07.896 --> 54:10.761
Leave a note.

54:20.140 --> 54:22.709
This is the way we came.

54:22.711 --> 54:24.511
We keep walking in this direction,

54:24.513 --> 54:27.212
we'll come to the path before too long.

54:47.702 --> 54:50.868
- We didn't pass the river coming in.
- Yeah, I know.

54:51.839 --> 54:53.673
But at least we can follow it down.

54:53.675 --> 54:55.240
It may take a little longer,

54:55.242 --> 54:58.509
but it'll lead us back to
civilization just the same.

55:11.559 --> 55:13.560
Sara. Hey. Careful. Hey.

55:13.562 --> 55:15.662
Hey, get back from there. Come on.

55:15.664 --> 55:18.930
- Do you see that?
- Jesus.

55:20.100 --> 55:21.801
Hey, come on.

55:21.803 --> 55:23.868
Get away from there. Come on.

55:27.742 --> 55:29.207
What are you doing?

55:29.209 --> 55:31.209
What do you mean?

55:31.211 --> 55:33.344
We were walking <i>that</i> way.

55:34.648 --> 55:36.149
- No, we weren't.
- Yes, we were.

55:36.151 --> 55:38.885
Two minutes ago, we were walking that way,

55:38.887 --> 55:41.220
and now you're leading
me back the way we came.

55:41.222 --> 55:44.990
No. Sara, we're following
the river down. Remember?

55:44.992 --> 55:47.358
We're not climbing the mountain.

55:47.661 --> 55:49.760
Down.

55:50.131 --> 55:52.696
Water flows down.

55:53.901 --> 55:56.001
See?

56:36.745 --> 56:38.778
<i>I feel guilty too.</i>

56:38.780 --> 56:40.178
<i>What do you mean?</i>

56:40.180 --> 56:42.147
<i>My parents' bodies.</i>

56:42.149 --> 56:45.752
<i>I closed my eyes, but she looked.</i>

56:45.754 --> 56:49.856
- Hello!
- <i>That's always been the difference between us.</i>

56:49.858 --> 56:52.356
- Oh, shit.
- <i>She looks at the dark stuff and I turn away.</i>

56:52.358 --> 56:54.861
- <i>What she saw...</i>
- You recorded that?

56:54.863 --> 56:57.196
You gave me permission, the other day.

56:57.198 --> 57:00.932
- That's why you questioned me so much last night.
- Yeah, I'm doing a story.

57:00.934 --> 57:03.767
That's why you stayed at the
campsite... for your story.

57:04.039 --> 57:05.905
In part.

57:05.907 --> 57:09.876
Also because I was concerned
about you... and your sister,

57:09.878 --> 57:11.444
and I liked you.

57:11.446 --> 57:14.414
- Do you even have a brother?
- Of course I do.

57:14.416 --> 57:16.647
What's his name?

57:17.986 --> 57:19.151
Mikey.

57:19.153 --> 57:22.553
- Which ear is he deaf in?
- His... His...

57:25.160 --> 57:28.393
Okay, yes, I wanted to get
closer to you for the story.

57:28.396 --> 57:32.298
Yes, but also mainly to get
closer to a pretty girl in the bar.

57:32.300 --> 57:35.032
- Who are you?
- Everything else I told you is true.

57:35.034 --> 57:38.104
- When did you meet Jess?
- I've never met her.

57:38.106 --> 57:41.841
- Yes, you did.
- Why do you keep saying that? It was just a line in a bar.

57:41.843 --> 57:43.308
- Give me your phone.
- Why?

57:43.310 --> 57:45.243
- Why not?
- Because it's my phone.

57:45.245 --> 57:47.145
You're hiding something?

57:47.147 --> 57:49.881
You're getting just a little too
agitated. It's making me uncomfortable.

57:49.883 --> 57:52.785
I'm lost in the woods with a
strange man who's been lying to me,

57:52.787 --> 57:55.287
and I do not give a shit if it
makes you feel uncomfortable.

57:55.289 --> 57:57.856
- Now, give me your phone!
- All right, calm down.

57:57.858 --> 57:59.957
I'll give you the phone.

58:00.961 --> 58:04.427
- Don't mess with it first.
- I'm unlocking it!

58:14.975 --> 58:18.044
- What are you doing?
- I'm deleting all the recordings.

58:18.046 --> 58:21.247
If you even <i>are</i> a journalist,
then permission is revoked.

58:21.249 --> 58:23.447
You cannot use my story.

58:23.450 --> 58:25.749
How do you...

58:27.521 --> 58:30.587
How do you what?

58:32.059 --> 58:34.457
Oh, my God.

58:34.896 --> 58:36.394
What?

58:36.396 --> 58:39.430
You met me on purpose, didn't you?

58:40.501 --> 58:43.136
I don't know what you think...

58:43.138 --> 58:44.970
or what you're talking about.

58:44.972 --> 58:46.906
- What did you do to her?
- Who, Jess?

58:46.908 --> 58:49.841
- Yeah.
- I've never met her.

58:49.843 --> 58:51.910
There are photos right here on this phone.

58:51.912 --> 58:53.879
- Give me the phone.
- Stay back.

58:53.881 --> 58:55.314
- Give me the damn phone!
- No!

58:55.316 --> 58:57.714
Give me it!

59:14.001 --> 59:15.867
Sara!

59:18.506 --> 59:21.405
Hey, you're gonna get lost!

59:21.408 --> 59:23.974
Come back!

59:24.512 --> 59:26.845
Sara!

59:37.392 --> 59:39.690
No.

01:00:11.459 --> 01:00:13.892
Sara!

01:01:18.059 --> 01:01:20.124
Aiden?

01:01:22.162 --> 01:01:24.227
Sara!

01:01:36.176 --> 01:01:38.343
<i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

01:01:38.345 --> 01:01:40.211
No.

01:01:40.213 --> 01:01:41.713
No.

01:01:41.716 --> 01:01:43.948
<i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:49.220
<i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

01:01:52.358 --> 01:01:54.792
<i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

01:01:55.696 --> 01:01:57.395
<i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

01:01:57.397 --> 01:01:59.863
You're not real!

01:02:03.338 --> 01:02:06.003
<i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

01:02:17.016 --> 01:02:19.050
<i>Turn around, Sara.</i>

01:02:45.646 --> 01:02:48.714
- Michi?
- Rob. Hey.

01:02:48.716 --> 01:02:51.848
We'll find her. Don't worry.

01:05:24.805 --> 01:05:29.574
<i>Sara.</i>

01:05:42.722 --> 01:05:47.457
<i>Sara.</i>

01:05:49.564 --> 01:05:51.629
Sara.

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:54.332
It's me, Hoshiko.

01:05:54.334 --> 01:05:56.334
- What are you doing down here?
- Come.

01:05:56.336 --> 01:05:58.336
- Come where?
- You come.

01:05:58.338 --> 01:06:00.272
Miss Jess want to see you.

01:06:00.274 --> 01:06:02.341
Jess?

01:06:02.343 --> 01:06:05.643
- I take you.
- Down here?

01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:09.646
What's making that noise?

01:06:11.751 --> 01:06:15.385
- Animal.
- That doesn't sound like an animal.

01:06:16.890 --> 01:06:20.023
Why is Jess down here?

01:06:24.365 --> 01:06:26.664
Tell me!

01:07:10.910 --> 01:07:13.310
Help!

01:07:13.713 --> 01:07:15.680
Can you hear me?

01:07:15.682 --> 01:07:17.948
Help!

01:07:18.852 --> 01:07:21.251
Help!

01:07:27.695 --> 01:07:30.062
- Sara?
- Aiden?

01:07:30.064 --> 01:07:32.330
- Sara.
- Aiden!

01:07:32.332 --> 01:07:34.398
- You gotta get me out of here.
- Hold on.

01:07:34.401 --> 01:07:36.334
I'm gonna find something
to throw down for you.

01:07:36.336 --> 01:07:39.202
Aiden, don't leave me, please! No!

01:07:52.687 --> 01:07:54.452
No.

01:07:54.454 --> 01:07:56.518
No.

01:07:58.693 --> 01:08:02.093
If you see something bad, it's
not real. It's just in your head.

01:08:02.095 --> 01:08:06.497
If you see something bad, it's
not real. It's in your head.

01:08:06.499 --> 01:08:10.200
If you see something bad, it's
not real. It's in your head.

01:08:10.537 --> 01:08:12.569
It's in your head.

01:08:13.374 --> 01:08:15.406
It's in your head.

01:08:17.545 --> 01:08:20.111
It's in your head.

01:09:32.051 --> 01:09:34.118
No.

01:09:37.023 --> 01:09:39.656
No!

01:09:43.731 --> 01:09:47.231
- Sara!
- Aiden.

01:09:47.600 --> 01:09:49.631
Sara, hang on.

01:09:51.071 --> 01:09:54.370
Aiden, get me out of here.

01:09:55.209 --> 01:09:57.476
Okay. All right, grab that.

01:09:57.478 --> 01:09:59.578
I gotcha.

01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:01.046
Okay.

01:10:01.048 --> 01:10:03.114
Pull.

01:10:25.872 --> 01:10:27.671
Hey.

01:10:28.209 --> 01:10:30.508
Sara, you okay?

01:10:34.548 --> 01:10:36.248
Michi was right.

01:10:36.250 --> 01:10:39.250
The forest <i>does</i> make you see things.

01:10:44.591 --> 01:10:46.691
Look.

01:10:46.693 --> 01:10:48.726
I found a place.

01:10:48.728 --> 01:10:51.997
It might have a radio. It's a
ranger station. It's not that far.

01:10:51.999 --> 01:10:55.432
You just stumbled across it right now?

01:11:05.278 --> 01:11:07.278
Here.

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:10.779
Take the knife.

01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:13.651
Why am I taking the knife?

01:11:13.653 --> 01:11:16.287
So you trust me more.

01:11:20.094 --> 01:11:22.293
We're in this together, right?

01:11:24.865 --> 01:11:26.963
Right.

01:11:27.634 --> 01:11:30.833
Just let me wash off first.

01:12:26.059 --> 01:12:28.292
Sara.

01:12:31.064 --> 01:12:33.097
You all right?

01:12:33.099 --> 01:12:35.431
I'm fine!

01:12:52.853 --> 01:12:57.721
Well, if there's no radio, at
least we got a place to sleep.

01:13:08.701 --> 01:13:10.799
Hello?

01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:29.353
Come on, baby. Come on. Work.

01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:52.144
Hey, Sara, give me the knife.

01:13:52.146 --> 01:13:54.345
What?

01:13:54.915 --> 01:13:57.381
The knife... let me have it.

01:13:57.383 --> 01:14:00.584
- Why?
- So I can open this thing up.

01:14:01.921 --> 01:14:05.922
Or I can smash it on the damn
table! Just give me the knife!

01:14:55.008 --> 01:14:57.775
Why do you think they locked the basement?

01:14:57.777 --> 01:14:59.477
What makes you think it's a basement?

01:14:59.479 --> 01:15:01.444
What else would it be?

01:15:01.447 --> 01:15:04.046
I don't know. A closet?

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:19.962
- Sara?
- Jess?

01:15:24.537 --> 01:15:27.538
- Jess?
- Shh.

01:15:45.826 --> 01:15:47.891
Oh!

01:16:20.058 --> 01:16:22.124
Okay.

01:16:22.862 --> 01:16:24.994
- Okay.
- God, please be real.

01:16:34.174 --> 01:16:38.043
Hey, do you wanna chow down
before it gets too dark to see?

01:16:38.045 --> 01:16:40.143
Huh?

01:16:44.951 --> 01:16:47.149
Sara, what are you doing?

01:17:00.166 --> 01:17:03.033
Here, it's the last one. You can have it.

01:17:06.005 --> 01:17:08.171
Come on. Take it.

01:17:19.887 --> 01:17:23.020
I don't know if the
forest made you a psycho

01:17:23.022 --> 01:17:25.323
or if you were crazy anyways.

01:17:25.325 --> 01:17:28.659
But if you don't let my
sister out of that basement,

01:17:28.661 --> 01:17:31.126
I will kill you.

01:17:31.465 --> 01:17:33.730
Sara.

01:17:34.433 --> 01:17:36.699
Wake up.

01:17:37.004 --> 01:17:39.403
Your sister is dead.

01:17:39.406 --> 01:17:42.139
- She's been in here for five days.
- Give me the key.

01:17:42.142 --> 01:17:45.276
Okay. All right. All right.

01:17:45.278 --> 01:17:47.945
I'll let her out, okay?
Just let me get the key.

01:17:47.947 --> 01:17:50.814
- Where is it?
- It's in my boot.

01:17:51.384 --> 01:17:53.716
Let me get it.

01:17:54.554 --> 01:17:56.954
Yeah.

01:18:48.107 --> 01:18:50.806
Jess?

01:18:52.312 --> 01:18:54.811
She...

01:18:55.247 --> 01:18:57.413
She's not here.

01:19:25.144 --> 01:19:26.842
Jess.

01:20:17.496 --> 01:20:19.762
Jess?

01:20:20.299 --> 01:20:22.733
Jess, no. Stop. Don't look. Don't look.

01:20:22.736 --> 01:20:24.734
Don't look.

01:20:24.736 --> 01:20:27.503
Don't look.

01:20:29.643 --> 01:20:31.309
Oh, God.

01:20:31.311 --> 01:20:33.445
Daddy, why?

01:20:33.447 --> 01:20:36.780
Oh, Daddy.

01:20:36.782 --> 01:20:38.515
Oh, God.

01:20:42.656 --> 01:20:44.454
Go!

01:20:44.790 --> 01:20:47.156
Go, go, go.

01:20:47.727 --> 01:20:50.193
Daddy. Daddy, no. Let me go!

01:20:53.532 --> 01:20:58.167
Let me... go!

01:21:43.916 --> 01:21:46.115
We should go.

01:22:44.411 --> 01:22:45.909
Oh, God, help!

01:22:45.911 --> 01:22:47.712
- Jess?
- Please, somebody help! Help me!

01:22:47.714 --> 01:22:49.980
Oh, God, Jess.

01:22:52.952 --> 01:22:55.385
Jess!

01:22:57.523 --> 01:22:59.588
Jess!

01:23:08.934 --> 01:23:10.966
Jess!

01:23:16.977 --> 01:23:19.943
Jess!

01:23:25.551 --> 01:23:27.252
Jess!

01:23:27.254 --> 01:23:29.184
Wait!

01:23:39.531 --> 01:23:42.699
- Oh, God, help me.
- Sara?

01:23:42.701 --> 01:23:46.035
Sara. Hey. Hey.

01:23:47.307 --> 01:23:50.204
Don't touch me!

01:23:50.477 --> 01:23:52.409
Jess. Jess.

01:23:52.411 --> 01:23:54.644
It's me. It's Rob.

01:23:55.682 --> 01:23:57.614
Rob?

01:23:57.616 --> 01:23:59.851
- Is that you?
- Yeah.

01:23:59.853 --> 01:24:01.718
Oh, God!

01:24:03.622 --> 01:24:07.190
I've been lost for days.
I didn't think I'd make it.

01:24:10.029 --> 01:24:13.396
- Hey, hey. Have you seen Sara?
- What?

01:24:13.398 --> 01:24:17.266
- Have you seen Sara?
- She's not with you?

01:24:18.838 --> 01:24:21.104
No.

01:24:37.890 --> 01:24:39.324
No.

01:24:39.326 --> 01:24:42.225
Please, let me go.

01:24:43.630 --> 01:24:45.695
Let me go!

01:25:05.984 --> 01:25:08.385
No! No!

01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:10.720
No! No!

01:25:11.991 --> 01:25:16.126
No!

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:28.738
She came for me.

01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:30.507
She came for me.

01:25:30.509 --> 01:25:33.142
She knew you were still alive.

01:25:35.915 --> 01:25:37.747
We go back in first thing, all right?

01:25:37.749 --> 01:25:39.917
- We have to go back right now.
- No, no, no.

01:25:39.919 --> 01:25:42.751
- Right now.
- Jess. Hey.

01:25:43.723 --> 01:25:45.821
What?

01:25:48.661 --> 01:25:50.727
Nothing.

01:25:52.465 --> 01:25:54.531
That's the...

01:25:56.803 --> 01:25:58.703
It's silent.

01:25:58.705 --> 01:26:01.437
Okay.

01:26:03.910 --> 01:26:06.575
Oh, Sara.
