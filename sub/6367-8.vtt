Well, moving crates into
a basement isn't a crime.

13:11.977 --> 13:14.344
- Depends on what's in the crates.
- That's not enough for a warrant.

you can't go in there.

He's acting out of desperation

an equally desperate response.

<i>Alison: As long as that reason
wasn't your gun in his face.</i>

20:01.353 --> 20:03.217
[laughs]

20:03.250 --> 20:06.920
I think you got the wrong
idea about me, Ms. Medding.

20:18.140 --> 20:21.171
You are hardly the first
cowboy cop I've ever dealt with.

20:21.204 --> 20:23.106
<i>You all smile, play the game,</i>

20:23.139 --> 20:25.978
<i>but you'd really rather just shoot
first and ask questions never.</i>

20:26.011 --> 20:28.639
And here I was thinking we were
just starting to hit it off.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.846
From what I understand, you've been
down this road before with Kai Proctor.

20:31.879 --> 20:34.381
<i>If I'm gonna get a search warrant,
it needs to be bulletproof.</i>

20:34.414 --> 20:36.077
No judge will issue one on hearsay.

20:39.118 --> 20:43.453
My informant saw the guns
being moved into the basement.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.626
- She's got soft hands.
- Shut your mouth.

20:54.667 --> 20:56.500
Lucas: What's going on?

20:56.533 --> 20:58.069
<i>Brock: Meg's in the hospital.</i>

20:58.102 --> 21:01.341
- What?
- They were getting even with Emmett.

21:01.374 --> 21:04.373
<i>- She assaulted me, Sheriff.
- Hondo: Yeah, I witnessed it.</i>

21:04.413 --> 21:06.675
I was defenseless.

21:06.708 --> 21:08.379
She okay?

21:08.411 --> 21:11.481
She was in surgery. We've been
looking for these assholes all night.

21:11.514 --> 21:14.313
- I sure hope she's okay.
- Shut the fuck up!

21:14.346 --> 21:16.483
[laughing]
Shut it!

21:16.524 --> 21:18.388
We were gonna head to
the hospital after this.

21:18.422 --> 21:21.999
It's gonna have to wait. I need you
both after you're done booking them.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.600
<i>Brock: Why? What's up?</i>

21:24.633 --> 21:27.277
Got a warrant to search Proctor's.

21:28.642 --> 21:30.409
Fuck!

21:31.738 --> 21:34.640
I want to go over potential
sites for a new lab.

21:36.041 --> 21:38.049
- I'll call you back.
- Kai Proctor.

21:38.082 --> 21:39.681
We have a warrant to
search these premises.

21:39.714 --> 21:42.280
- On what grounds?
- It's all in here.

21:42.320 --> 21:43.951
Maybe I didn't make myself clear.

21:43.984 --> 21:46.788
Oh, no, no.
You made yourself perfectly clear.

21:54.025 --> 21:57.091
You got anything you want to say to me?

21:57.124 --> 22:02.435
I'll make sure the DA's office
takes your cooperation into account.

22:02.468 --> 22:05.002
I don't know what it is
you hope to find, Sheriff.

22:05.035 --> 22:07.571
So that's a "no?"

22:07.636 --> 22:10.075
Okay. You mind if I look around?

22:10.108 --> 22:12.409
<i>Thanks.</i>

22:22.250 --> 22:23.851
[knocks]

22:23.884 --> 22:26.258
<i>Wait a minute. What's that?
[knocking]</i>

22:28.056 --> 22:31.159
What's that sound like?

22:31.192 --> 22:36.093
See, to me,
that sounds like...

22:36.126 --> 22:38.733
<i>[switch clicks]
...a door.</i>

22:38.766 --> 22:41.500
- Bastard! I'll fucking kill you!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:41.533 --> 22:44.499
I'll fucking kill you!

22:44.532 --> 22:47.373
Easy, Kai.

22:48.512 --> 22:51.814
- This is not changing anything.
- I think it might.

22:51.847 --> 22:53.512
<i>- Brock: Wow.
- What's in there?</i>

22:53.545 --> 22:57.121
I'm guessing this wasn't on
the original floor plan, right?

22:57.154 --> 23:00.488
<i>Brock: You have permits
for all these illegal guns?</i>

23:02.922 --> 23:04.491
He asked you a question.

23:04.532 --> 23:05.994
Fuck you.

23:06.028 --> 23:07.961
<i>- I'll take that as a no.
- I'll fucking kill you.</i>

23:07.994 --> 23:10.235
<i>Kai Proctor, you're under arrest.</i>

23:10.268 --> 23:12.700
- You have the right...
- I know my fucking rights!

23:12.741 --> 23:15.035
Yeah, okay, but let me
have my moment, all right?

23:15.076 --> 23:17.074
Kai Proctor, you are under arrest.

23:17.107 --> 23:18.642
You have the right to remain silent.

23:18.675 --> 23:21.879
<i>Anything you do say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.</i>

23:21.920 --> 23:24.015
Now, you have the right to an attorney.

23:24.056 --> 23:27.455
If you can't afford an attorney, the
court, they'll appoint one for you.

23:27.488 --> 23:30.252
- You're fucking dead.
- Take him away.

23:35.459 --> 23:38.593
All right, let's get the
guns and anything else.

23:40.865 --> 23:42.865
Sure.

23:49.171 --> 23:52.177
Well, the internal bleeding
was a lot worse than we thought.

23:52.211 --> 23:54.273
But she's gonna be okay?

23:54.314 --> 23:57.714
We're gonna watch her, make sure
that her pressure doesn't drop again,

23:57.747 --> 24:00.250
but, yes, she's going to be okay.

24:02.616 --> 24:07.224
But the trauma was too
great for the fetus.

24:10.224 --> 24:11.958
What?

24:15.492 --> 24:17.426
We'll run down the guns.

24:17.459 --> 24:20.026
If we're lucky, one of them
has been used in a major crime.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.530
- If not?
- None of the guns are registered.

24:22.563 --> 24:24.002
We've already got him
on illegal possession.

24:24.035 --> 24:27.836
That is a major offense, especially
if there was gun trafficking.

24:27.869 --> 24:30.003
How long can you keep him in county?

24:30.076 --> 24:31.707
Long enough to try and make a case.

24:31.740 --> 24:34.148
<i>- I want to go over the warrant again.
- We've been over that already.</i>

24:34.181 --> 24:35.546
Well, now you're gonna
go over it with me.

24:35.579 --> 24:36.947
If you're gonna be late
to the party, Gordon...

24:36.980 --> 24:39.212
Did you not get the fucking
memo? I'm still your boss.

24:39.253 --> 24:41.850
Proctor's not gonna beat
the warrant, end of story.

24:41.883 --> 24:43.354
I've faced Proctor in court.

24:43.387 --> 24:46.388
- He's got a good lawyer.
- Yeah, now so do we.

24:47.390 --> 24:48.863
You want to fuck with me on this?

24:48.896 --> 24:51.166
Do I step out so you
can measure your dicks?

24:54.337 --> 24:57.134
<i>The feds will be by to pick up the
guns first thing in the morning.</i>

24:57.167 --> 25:00.267
Until then, thank you
for your time, Sheriff.

25:10.149 --> 25:11.981
Lucas: Guess everyone
needs a hobby, huh?

25:12.014 --> 25:16.512
Stamps, that's a hobby.
This is psychotic.

25:19.416 --> 25:23.316
- So, how'd it go with the ADA?
- Good.

25:23.357 --> 25:25.189
She thinks we have a strong case.

25:26.989 --> 25:30.262
Well, hopefully it'll hold up this time.

25:30.294 --> 25:34.799
Hey, I wanted to ask you.
Who tipped you off on the guns?

25:34.833 --> 25:37.199
Confidential informant, Brock.

25:37.240 --> 25:40.303
Not that I don't trust
you. Any word on Emmett?

25:40.337 --> 25:42.074
I left a couple messages.

25:42.115 --> 25:45.346
Okay, I'm gonna head over
to the hospital, check in.

25:45.379 --> 25:47.051
Great.

25:50.357 --> 25:52.454
You know what we haven't
talked about in a while?

25:52.494 --> 25:54.954
- What's that?
- Him.

25:54.987 --> 25:56.921
Sheriff Lucas Hood.

25:56.962 --> 25:59.898
When he first got here, he did
whatever the hell he wanted.

25:59.931 --> 26:02.435
We were all so shocked.
And now, all of a sudden,

26:02.468 --> 26:05.774
he's Mr. Johnny By-the-book.

26:05.807 --> 26:10.847
- I guess better late than never, huh?
- I guess.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.879
He tell you who his informant is?

26:12.912 --> 26:15.185
Why would he tell me and not you?

26:15.218 --> 26:22.527
- I don't know. You two seem pretty close.
- I'm sorry?

26:22.528 --> 26:25.766
No, I'm...
Come on, Siobhan. I'm not blind.

26:25.799 --> 26:27.734
I see things, you know?

26:27.767 --> 26:30.301
<i>I'm assuming you two are probably
sleeping together at this point.</i>

26:30.335 --> 26:33.113
You want to tell me about it?

26:34.546 --> 26:37.112
There's nothing to talk about, Brock.

26:39.214 --> 26:41.013
Oh, fuck.

26:41.046 --> 26:43.087
Go fish.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.422
Hey, you want a burger or a hot dog?

26:45.455 --> 26:47.086
- Uh, both.
- Okay.

26:47.119 --> 26:49.822
- How about you, Deva?
- I'll take a burger, please.

26:49.855 --> 26:52.262
Hey, yo! Stop. You're cheating.

26:52.294 --> 26:54.826
<i>Put that back. That's
not how we play. Come on.</i>

27:04.467 --> 27:07.475
<i>Damn it.
[footsteps]</i>

27:08.442 --> 27:10.567
Carrie.

27:13.749 --> 27:16.416
If you want to know, I'll tell you.

27:16.457 --> 27:18.321
But you really don't want to know.

27:18.354 --> 27:20.687
Carrie, wait.

27:30.466 --> 27:33.441
Look, why don't you stay for dinner?

27:33.475 --> 27:36.778
The problem is this new ADA Medding.

27:36.811 --> 27:39.210
She's smart. And from
everything I've heard,

27:39.243 --> 27:40.643
she is not open for business.

27:40.684 --> 27:42.212
Everyone has a price.

27:42.253 --> 27:45.314
You want to add attempted
bribery on top of the gun charges?

27:45.347 --> 27:48.088
Everyone has a weakness.

27:48.121 --> 27:51.622
Anyway, our best shot is to
attack the search warrant.

27:51.655 --> 27:54.619
We attack the veracity of their
confidential informant's claim.

27:54.652 --> 27:56.649
- Burton: Which was?
- Their CI claims

27:56.690 --> 27:59.124
to have seen guns in your basement.

27:59.157 --> 28:01.364
<i>That was the basis for
obtaining a warrant.</i>

28:01.397 --> 28:03.131
- Impossible.
- Is it?

28:03.164 --> 28:04.697
No one knew about that room.

28:04.730 --> 28:07.096
No one could have possibly
seen what was inside of it.

28:07.129 --> 28:09.800
Rebecca and Burton are the only
other people with access to my home.

28:09.832 --> 28:11.535
- Is there anyone else?
- No.

28:11.568 --> 28:15.736
Think. If we knew who the CI is,
maybe we can discount the warrant.

28:15.769 --> 28:18.306
Juliet.

28:20.181 --> 28:22.316
<i>Jackson: Who's Juliet?</i>

28:27.021 --> 28:30.219
I'm going to step outside for a minute.

28:33.357 --> 28:35.365
[knocks]

28:43.441 --> 28:45.239
Take care of the girl.

28:49.610 --> 28:52.807
<i>[knocks]
[door opens]</i>

29:12.755 --> 29:14.923
<i>Lucas: How is she?</i>

29:14.956 --> 29:16.459
[sighs]

29:16.492 --> 29:18.763
Doctor says she's gonna be fine.

29:20.667 --> 29:22.698
That's good.

29:25.539 --> 29:29.442
Siobhan and Brock,
they got Sharp and his buddies.

29:29.475 --> 29:31.610
<i>They're in holding right now.</i>

29:37.482 --> 29:39.649
<i>Lucas: They're not
gonna get away with this.</i>

29:43.282 --> 29:45.386
Okay.

29:47.892 --> 29:49.596
Yeah.

29:49.629 --> 29:51.860
<i>Thanks.</i>

29:52.965 --> 29:54.868
Yeah.

29:56.365 --> 29:58.940
<i>Yeah, we also arrested Proctor.</i>

29:59.940 --> 30:02.109
For what?

30:04.444 --> 30:06.440
<i>Assault weapons, but...</i>

30:06.472 --> 30:09.741
<i>it doesn't really matter right now.</i>

30:14.575 --> 30:16.205
Emmett.

30:35.382 --> 30:37.989
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:39.885 --> 30:42.556
Doctor says you're gonna be fine.

30:49.163 --> 30:51.995
I lost the baby.

31:00.443 --> 31:04.041
It's gonna be okay.
Okay?

31:04.074 --> 31:06.841
You just need to get some rest.

31:06.914 --> 31:12.081
<i>- It's gonna be all right.
- Emmett.</i>

31:12.114 --> 31:13.718
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be at the hospital?

31:13.751 --> 31:15.949
- Meg is sleeping.
- How is she?

31:15.982 --> 31:17.780
- She's gonna be fine.
- Thank God.

31:17.821 --> 31:20.251
<i>- Yeah.
- You can't still be on duty tonight.</i>

31:20.317 --> 31:22.555
<i>Emmett: No, I already
called Brock to cover.</i>

31:24.923 --> 31:28.522
This is a test. That's all.

31:30.427 --> 31:32.064
You're right.

31:32.097 --> 31:34.428
Okay, well, I'll wait for Brock.
You get back to Meg.

31:34.461 --> 31:37.861
[laughs] He's gonna be
here in, like, five minutes.

31:37.902 --> 31:39.530
It's fine.

31:39.563 --> 31:43.833
Just try to get some rest, sweetheart.

31:51.341 --> 31:56.511
It's gonna be okay.
Promise.

32:05.996 --> 32:07.564
- All right.
- All right.

32:07.605 --> 32:09.898
- Well, you have a good night.
- You, too.

32:09.939 --> 32:13.432
<i>Alma: And you tell Meg that
I will be praying for her.</i>

32:13.473 --> 32:15.440
<i>Emmett: I will.</i>

32:15.473 --> 32:18.039
- All right.
- Thank you.

32:43.757 --> 32:46.062
<i>Meg: Just a test.</i>

32:47.760 --> 32:51.033
Cheryl, I'm going to need
the other thing as well.

32:51.066 --> 32:53.506
I think she must have stepped out.

32:56.108 --> 32:58.011
Sheriff Hood.

32:58.044 --> 32:59.379
How can I help you?

32:59.412 --> 33:00.874
Well, I don't know if you heard,

33:00.915 --> 33:02.980
but we arrested Kai Proctor last night.

33:03.013 --> 33:04.917
Possession of illegal firearms.

33:04.950 --> 33:07.516
- What does that have to do with me?
- Nothing I know of.

33:07.557 --> 33:09.787
But I am curious

33:09.820 --> 33:13.522
why Proctor would have so much
information on the Kinaho casino.

33:13.587 --> 33:16.560
I mean, that is a lot of information

33:16.594 --> 33:19.024
to have about someone else's business.

33:19.065 --> 33:22.264
Don't you think? So I started wondering,

33:22.297 --> 33:26.200
maybe everything going on
between you and him lately,

33:26.233 --> 33:30.006
maybe you have a little more
to do with him than I know.

33:30.039 --> 33:33.171
[chuckles]
Do I need to call my lawyer?

33:33.204 --> 33:35.906
I know you'd never
intentionally risk the well-being

33:35.939 --> 33:39.534
of your tribe by getting in
bed with someone like Proctor.

33:39.575 --> 33:42.975
So I'd like to help you get
him out of your business.

33:44.377 --> 33:47.344
And why would you do that, Sheriff?

33:47.385 --> 33:51.317
We have a case against him
with these guns. It might stick.

33:51.350 --> 33:54.884
But if it doesn't, I
want some insurance.

33:58.723 --> 34:00.787
And what do I get out of it?

34:02.227 --> 34:07.261
Same thing I get.
Same thing this whole town gets.

34:21.018 --> 34:25.518
My father had certain
dealings with Kai Proctor.

34:25.551 --> 34:29.257
<i>Extortion rackets for land grabs.</i>

34:29.290 --> 34:32.992
I inherited those along with
everything else when my father passed.

34:33.025 --> 34:38.001
He was a revered leader,
so I hope you can understand

34:38.034 --> 34:40.264
why I didn't want to bring
these things to light.

34:40.304 --> 34:44.503
Of course.
I understand that.

34:46.072 --> 34:48.873
But I think we've all been
living in the dark long enough.

34:48.914 --> 34:52.943
Yeah.
I think so, too.

35:14.028 --> 35:17.466
<i>Sharp: I've been wondering when
you'd come around to pay us a visit.</i>

35:21.234 --> 35:23.473
Look at him, boys.

35:26.843 --> 35:29.977
That is one angry black man.

35:30.010 --> 35:33.379
I guess we're lucky the bald
guy and the dyke caught us first.

35:33.420 --> 35:36.018
- You think so?
- Hey, I liked the dyke.

35:36.083 --> 35:37.250
[laughs]

35:39.419 --> 35:42.188
Do you know what I
love about this country?

35:42.261 --> 35:48.530
The same laws that protect people
from me, protect me from you.

35:48.563 --> 35:51.234
You sound like my father.

35:53.736 --> 35:56.101
I think that was an insult.

35:59.936 --> 36:03.142
<i>You see, my father believed
that the law spoke for all men,</i>

36:03.207 --> 36:04.573
<i>even a black janitor.</i>

36:04.606 --> 36:06.614
You just have to have
faith in the system.

36:06.647 --> 36:08.278
And he did.

36:08.311 --> 36:11.353
One day his boss cheats
him out of some wages,

36:11.451 --> 36:13.388
so he takes the guy to court.

36:13.421 --> 36:17.123
The judge says, "Boy, don't
bite the hand that feeds you."

36:17.164 --> 36:20.335
- Pops gets fired.
- That's some judge.

36:20.368 --> 36:23.670
Couple years later he buys
his first car. It gets stolen.

36:23.703 --> 36:26.668
So like any law-abiding
citizen, he goes to the police.

36:26.701 --> 36:29.908
They say, "Boy, don't you
know we got better things to do

36:29.941 --> 36:31.677
than to chase after some nigger's car?"

36:34.012 --> 36:38.346
The point is, my father died without
ever having anyone to speak for him.

36:38.379 --> 36:40.147
That's touching.

36:40.180 --> 36:43.248
I never wanted to be a cop.

36:43.281 --> 36:45.646
Just wanted to play football.

36:47.014 --> 36:49.389
That didn't work out.

36:49.422 --> 36:53.521
Now, you guys got me realizing
the real reason I'm here

36:53.554 --> 36:56.289
<i>is to speak for people who
can't speak for themselves.</i>

36:56.322 --> 36:58.960
People like my father.

37:05.231 --> 37:08.200
And my baby boy who you killed today.

37:11.773 --> 37:14.108
Fuck you, man.

37:14.141 --> 37:16.708
I ain't scared of you.

37:27.356 --> 37:28.891
What the hell is this?

37:28.924 --> 37:30.923
Relax. He ain't gonna do shit.

37:30.956 --> 37:33.093
There's no one else here.

37:38.371 --> 37:42.775
You get past me and you're home free.

37:42.809 --> 37:46.079
Oh, I'm gonna fuck you up, spook.

37:48.584 --> 37:50.922
Sharp: Help him, asshole!

37:52.324 --> 37:53.958
Take him out, Curtis.

37:53.991 --> 37:55.391
Nighty-night.

37:55.432 --> 37:57.829
Come on, he's going down. You got him.

37:57.862 --> 37:59.492
Go night-night.

37:59.565 --> 38:02.362
- You got him.
- Night-night.

38:02.396 --> 38:04.834
He's going down.
[shouts]

38:10.973 --> 38:13.412
[panting]

38:13.445 --> 38:15.476
<i>Sharp: He's had enough.</i>

38:16.948 --> 38:18.915
What did you say?

38:18.948 --> 38:21.252
I said he's had enough!

38:31.169 --> 38:33.366
You know how you feel right now?

38:33.399 --> 38:36.770
That rage that you're feeling?

38:37.844 --> 38:39.981
That keeps building inside you

38:40.014 --> 38:43.316
because somebody
touched someone you love.

38:45.717 --> 38:49.281
I feel that rage every day

38:49.322 --> 38:53.289
when I see you and your people

38:53.322 --> 38:55.059
overrunning this country.

38:55.092 --> 38:58.056
It makes people feel better
to say we're ignorant,

38:58.089 --> 39:00.128
but I see exactly what's going on.

39:00.161 --> 39:02.762
I'm not ignorant.

39:04.403 --> 39:06.506
And I'm not sorry.

39:10.505 --> 39:12.503
Same deal.

39:12.536 --> 39:17.007
You get past me,
you're home free.

39:26.224 --> 39:28.522
[shouts]

39:42.337 --> 39:44.539
[grunts]

40:00.758 --> 40:04.029
[gasps]

40:09.700 --> 40:12.666
[gasping, wheezing]

40:13.836 --> 40:16.200
[laughing]

40:32.554 --> 40:35.457
[gasping]

41:36.064 --> 41:37.933
You know, if you're
gonna be here this late,

41:37.967 --> 41:41.102
feel free to pick up a mop and a broom.

41:41.135 --> 41:43.807
Tables can never be too clean.

41:47.080 --> 41:49.477
Shit.

41:49.508 --> 41:51.704
I got you, motherfucker.

41:51.744 --> 41:53.438
What?

41:53.471 --> 41:55.574
- Got who?
- Rabbit.

41:55.607 --> 41:57.614
- I got him.
- How?

41:57.647 --> 42:01.044
FBI followed protocol and digitized
all of Agent Racine's files.

42:01.077 --> 42:04.614
It was a shot in the dark, but I found
an old exploit from a legacy system.

42:06.256 --> 42:07.791
I used the computer.

42:07.825 --> 42:11.460
Yeah, right. Racine found Rabbit?

42:11.492 --> 42:14.555
Yes, he did. He just didn't know it.

42:14.596 --> 42:16.396
But I do.

42:17.859 --> 42:20.295
Kind of wish you didn't.

42:25.266 --> 42:27.000
Hey.

42:36.036 --> 42:39.009
- I was hoping you'd still be up.
- I'm up.

42:44.314 --> 42:46.144
Listen, I just wanted to explain...

42:46.177 --> 42:48.616
what, about the fact that you got an
illegal search warrant for Proctor's arrest?

42:48.650 --> 42:50.184
I wouldn't put it quite like that.

42:50.217 --> 42:52.016
Juliet never said
anything about those guns.

42:52.050 --> 42:54.289
- You lied to get that warrant.
- But I ended up being right.

42:54.322 --> 42:56.460
- That is not the point.
- What's the point, then?

42:56.525 --> 42:59.164
That's not the point.
You know what Proctor's capable of.

42:59.197 --> 43:01.194
- You put that woman's life on the line.
- Oh, come on.

43:01.227 --> 43:03.298
Not to mention my career.
But that's nothing new for you.

43:03.331 --> 43:05.202
- Hey, I didn't ask you for anything.
- You already did.

43:05.235 --> 43:08.572
The second you got that warrant,
you made me complicit in your lie.

43:08.604 --> 43:11.571
- Yeah, but Proctor...
- I don't give a fuck about Proctor, okay,

43:11.612 --> 43:14.010
or how you got him, but if
you think that sleeping with me

43:14.043 --> 43:15.441
<i>gets you my unquestioning loyalty...</i>

43:15.475 --> 43:18.248
- You know that's not what I think.
- How do I know?

43:19.294 --> 43:22.392
How do I know?
You never tell me anything.

43:27.285 --> 43:30.302
I'll answer any question you have.

43:31.557 --> 43:34.093
Right now.

43:39.737 --> 43:42.400
<i>[phone vibrating]</i>

43:52.618 --> 43:55.184
It's Brock.

43:55.217 --> 43:57.683
Oh, my God.

43:57.724 --> 44:01.258
<i>- Brock: Hey, Hood, over here.
- Did you call for an ambulance?</i>

44:01.291 --> 44:03.596
<i>- Yeah, they're on their way.
- Siobhan: Fuck.</i>

44:03.628 --> 44:05.996
They're alive.
I need more bandages.

44:27.459 --> 44:31.193
Hey, Emmett, you want the
EMT to take a look at you?

44:31.226 --> 44:33.163
No.

44:35.733 --> 44:39.204
Two of the guys are mostly okay.

44:39.237 --> 44:43.261
A lot of broken bones
and concussions, but...

44:44.196 --> 44:48.961
the one guy,
Sharp, he's...

44:49.743 --> 44:52.077
<i>he's pretty bad.</i>

44:54.480 --> 44:59.252
Listen, Emmett, I think we
need to get your story straight

44:59.285 --> 45:01.653
<i>- before we call you a lawyer.
- Lucas: Hey, Brock.</i>

45:01.686 --> 45:04.485
You leave us alone for a minute?

45:04.526 --> 45:10.445
Yeah.
Hey, we're gonna figure this out.

45:22.740 --> 45:25.170
There's nothing to figure out.

45:36.224 --> 45:39.265
<i>You were in an emotional state.</i>

45:39.298 --> 45:42.464
<i>Your wife, your baby.</i>

45:42.497 --> 45:46.105
They taunted you, you snapped.

45:47.370 --> 45:51.740
- You didn't know what you were doing.
- I knew exactly what I was doing.

45:56.854 --> 45:59.917
I've been dealing with guys
like Sharp my whole life.

45:59.950 --> 46:03.922
<i>Maybe not as extreme as him,
but it's always something.</i>

46:03.955 --> 46:08.121
A look, a comment.

46:10.129 --> 46:12.223
Something.

46:13.464 --> 46:15.898
You know, you get
real good at burying it

46:15.931 --> 46:18.498
and hiding it behind a smile.

46:21.344 --> 46:23.504
This, I couldn't let it go.

46:25.336 --> 46:27.272
I didn't want to.

46:30.682 --> 46:33.313
<i>I've been following
His teachings for years.</i>

46:33.346 --> 46:37.184
<i>Been turning the other cheek.</i>

46:37.217 --> 46:39.224
<i>The thing about it
is if I could go back,</i>

46:39.257 --> 46:42.091
I'd do the same thing to
those pieces of shit again.

46:42.124 --> 46:45.962
I'd do the same thing again and again

46:45.995 --> 46:49.196
even though I know it's a sin.

46:51.069 --> 46:54.624
So what kind of Christian
does that make me?

47:01.643 --> 47:04.082
[sighs]

47:04.115 --> 47:07.049
You know, when Meg first
told me she was pregnant...

47:10.754 --> 47:15.827
my first thought was
"How can we raise a kid here?"

47:19.469 --> 47:21.764
<i>I mean, this town.</i>

47:21.805 --> 47:23.372
<i>[sighs]</i>

47:23.405 --> 47:28.340
<i>It's like everything that's good
just gets swallowed up by the bad.</i>

47:31.478 --> 47:35.380
<i>It's like a never-ending cycle of shit.</i>

47:42.683 --> 47:45.155
<i>Guys like Sharp feel like
they can do whatever they want</i>

47:45.188 --> 47:47.357
<i>to whoever they want.</i>

47:53.168 --> 47:56.835
<i>And we're supposed
to be part of the solution.</i>

47:58.573 --> 48:01.108
<i>We're supposed to hold that line.</i>

48:04.539 --> 48:09.285
But there is no line.
Not here.

48:13.387 --> 48:18.813
The Bible says,
"See that no one repays evil for evil."

48:22.321 --> 48:26.099
Sometimes repaying it is all you've got.

48:29.729 --> 48:33.080
I got no problem with that.

48:35.567 --> 48:37.735
