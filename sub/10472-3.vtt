00:15.560 --> 00:18.239
Hello, love. Fancy some eggs today?

00:18.240 --> 00:20.279
Oh, not today. Thank you, though.

00:20.280 --> 00:21.919
'In the late 1950s,

00:21.920 --> 00:26.999
'the East End of London
was a closely woven world.

00:27.000 --> 00:31.559
'A vibrant community,
defined by ties of blood

00:31.560 --> 00:33.880
'and sustained by threads
of friendship.'

00:35.880 --> 00:37.240
WOMAN: What?

00:38.520 --> 00:40.759
Yeah, and don't come back then.

00:40.760 --> 00:44.439
'We were part of the fabric
of the district, needed, liked

00:44.440 --> 00:46.639
'and usually respected.'

00:46.640 --> 00:48.519
Are these avocado pears?

00:48.520 --> 00:51.199
Heard that? She had to check!

00:51.200 --> 00:52.880
With all her education!

00:54.680 --> 00:57.719
I'm not a greengrocer, I'm a midwife.

00:57.720 --> 01:01.159
It looks as though we'll be seeing
you at the clinic soon.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.119
What's it to you?

01:03.120 --> 01:04.718
We don't hold with no clinics.

01:04.720 --> 01:07.359
Oh. Are you seeing your GP?

01:07.360 --> 01:10.239
We don't hold with them
neither, do we, Meg?

01:10.240 --> 01:13.239
Mr Culpeper, he's our doctor.

01:13.240 --> 01:16.159
Nicholas Culpeper? The herbalist?

01:16.160 --> 01:18.719
He was writing 300 years ago!

01:18.720 --> 01:20.719
Yeah. Old wisdom.

01:20.720 --> 01:23.679
We don't need nothing
newfangled, do we, Mave?

01:23.680 --> 01:25.799
Never have done yet, and we don't now.

01:25.800 --> 01:29.759
And not from Nursey No Brains who
don't know an avocado

01:29.760 --> 01:31.519
Uh... I'll take four.

01:31.520 --> 01:33.719
Two and eight. Two and eight?

01:33.720 --> 01:36.200
Eightpence each. Do
you need a pencil? No.

01:39.440 --> 01:42.599
The clinic's at All Saints parish
hall on Tuesday afternoons.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.120
You can just drop in.

01:45.520 --> 01:47.439
We're on the stall Tuesdays.

01:47.440 --> 01:52.119
Sid! Sid! Get them apples over here.

01:52.120 --> 01:53.919
Then get us a tray of tomatoes.

01:53.920 --> 01:57.160
Then mind out the way, in case
he mistakes you for a swede.

01:59.040 --> 02:01.759
Sid? Get over 'ere
and earn your keep.

02:01.760 --> 02:03.399
I'm coming.

02:03.400 --> 02:06.199
SISTER JULIENNE: The usual gift
from a grateful patient.

02:06.200 --> 02:08.360
But I'm trying to sweeten a pill.

02:09.400 --> 02:10.719
Oh?

02:10.720 --> 02:12.719
The London Hospital
is short-staffed again,

02:12.720 --> 02:15.279
and we've been asked to offer
a nurse up for secondment.

02:15.280 --> 02:17.719
But we're short-staffed
for the next six months,

02:17.720 --> 02:19.759
until Chummy gets back
from Sierra Leone.

02:19.760 --> 02:22.319
But we have reinforcements
coming, and they don't.

02:22.320 --> 02:24.920
They've had staffing problems
on men's surgical.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.119
It's two years
since I was on men's surgical.

02:29.120 --> 02:32.719
Then you can use this as a chance
to refresh your skills.

02:32.720 --> 02:36.520
Sometimes these arrangements
can benefit both parties.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.399
Take two.

02:40.400 --> 02:43.199
Matron expects you at half-past one.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.760
And next week you're on night duty.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.840
Can I help you?

03:18.080 --> 03:19.959
Jane Sutton.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.200
I'm expected by Sister Julienne.

03:23.480 --> 03:27.519
I'm Cynthia Miller. I'll take you
to her office. Thank you.

03:27.520 --> 03:30.319
I wouldn't mind a stint
on male surgical.

03:30.320 --> 03:32.999
I got ear, nose and throat
when I was seconded last year,

03:33.000 --> 03:35.639
it was one set of adenoids
after another.

03:35.640 --> 03:37.319
How's Mrs Ritson?

03:37.320 --> 03:38.679
Little boy.

03:38.680 --> 03:41.559
And look - avocado pears.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.119
They were eightpence each.

03:43.120 --> 03:45.520
Not near my sterilised equipment,
thank you very much.

03:47.520 --> 03:51.159
And I've just taken someone
to Sister Julienne's office.

03:51.160 --> 03:55.119
She had a case with her. I think
we might be getting someone new.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.079
You're going to need them. I've just
been seconded to the London.

03:58.080 --> 03:59.480
No!

04:01.080 --> 04:04.679
This is Jane Sutton,
who joins us today.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.440
Jane, you've already met Nurse Miller,

04:06.441 --> 04:10.119
but this is Nurse Lee, Sister
Bernadette and Nurse Franklin.

04:10.120 --> 04:11.839
Hello. Greetings.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.319
Another midwife,
how perfectly marvellous.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.238
I'm not a midwife. I'm sorry.

04:16.240 --> 04:19.199
Jane joins us in a new role,
as medical orderly.

04:19.200 --> 04:21.238
She comes with plenty of experience,

04:21.240 --> 04:23.839
from assisting at St Gideon's Home.

04:23.840 --> 04:26.159
That's an asylum, isn't it? Yes.

04:26.160 --> 04:28.120
Mental cases as well as incurables!

04:28.121 --> 04:31.279
I take my hat off to you -
that must be perfectly gruelling.

04:31.280 --> 04:33.039
I'm sure it's very rewarding.

04:33.040 --> 04:36.159
Nurse Franklin will show you
to your quarters.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.839
And when you've freshened up,

04:37.840 --> 04:40.960
go to the kitchen. Perhaps Nurse
Miller will have made a cup of tea.

04:46.320 --> 04:48.000
Is this yours?

04:51.120 --> 04:53.479
Gosh, you must hardly
have anything in it.

04:53.480 --> 04:55.239
PHONE RINGS

04:55.240 --> 05:00.119
Oh. Fred, can you show Jane the way?
She's in Chummy's old room.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.759
A pleasure.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.840
PHONE CONTINUES TO RING

05:05.440 --> 05:08.159
Course,
it's a big pair of shoes to fill,

05:08.160 --> 05:10.319
Nurse Noakes'.

05:10.320 --> 05:13.559
She was head and shoulders
above the others.

05:13.560 --> 05:16.439
She didn't see eye to eye
with everyone.

05:16.440 --> 05:19.359
But we all looked up to her,
in many ways.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.160
Now, one moment, please.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.239
There we are.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.080
All yours.

05:47.320 --> 05:52.319
It says here the thing for scourge
of the bladder is marshmallow.

05:52.320 --> 05:54.199
I wouldn't mind a few of them.

05:54.200 --> 05:56.440
They've got them down the
pick'n'mix in Woollies.

05:56.441 --> 05:59.639
I don't mean the sweets,
I mean the herb!

05:59.640 --> 06:02.680
We'll have to get down Hackney
Marshes, it grows there.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.520
They might have pills for it,
at that clinic.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.039
The maternity clinic?

06:09.040 --> 06:10.559
It'd all be free.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.278
This book tells us all we need to know.

06:12.279 --> 06:14.200
Or it would,
if you'd let me concentrate.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.879
Can't we just ask to go
and see that nurse?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.519
The little one.

06:22.520 --> 06:25.600
Nursey No Brains? She didn't look
like she'd be much bother.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.719
We'll go.

06:31.720 --> 06:34.080
But just so you can see
you're not missing anything.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.080
Yes?

06:54.000 --> 06:55.719
I was looking for the kitchen.

06:55.720 --> 07:01.000
Ahh, oh, might I venture to hope
that you are in fact a cook?

07:02.040 --> 07:05.319
We are abandoned by the
esteemed Mrs B every Tuesday,

07:05.320 --> 07:07.919
and must make shift for ourselves.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.960
This arrangement is very
far from satisfactory.

07:12.040 --> 07:17.039
The stench of last week's spam
is still clinging to my three-ply.

07:17.040 --> 07:18.600
That's very clever.

07:19.800 --> 07:21.800
Is it Pinky, or is it Perky?

07:23.280 --> 07:25.839
I have yet to ascertain.

07:25.840 --> 07:28.839
Well, it'll all become clear
once you've knitted the clothes.

07:28.840 --> 07:32.080
Perky wears a hat in the general way.

07:33.880 --> 07:37.520
I would suggest
we divert ourselves with cake.

07:39.400 --> 07:43.120
But since it is a Tuesday
there will be nothing in the tin.

07:51.520 --> 07:54.759
'Would Dr Jones please
make his way to outpatients.

07:54.760 --> 07:56.519
'Dr Jones to outpatients.'

07:56.520 --> 07:58.719
CHATTER

07:58.720 --> 08:00.680
PHONE RINGS

08:06.280 --> 08:07.760
Matron?

08:10.000 --> 08:11.360
I'm Nurse Lee.

08:13.600 --> 08:17.199
As you seem to have invited yourself
to enter, Nurse Lee,

08:17.200 --> 08:20.400
I suggest you wait until I have
attended to my task.

08:27.160 --> 08:30.759
Sister Julienne informs me that all
your credentials are in order,

08:30.760 --> 08:34.279
and that you are diligent and
hardworking. Yes, Matron.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.799
Have you ever scrubbed
for theatre? Yes.

08:36.799 --> 08:38.438
Supervised, or unsupervised?

08:38.440 --> 08:39.999
Only supervised, I'm afraid.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.679
That is less than optimal.

08:41.679 --> 08:44.359
The theatres are
exceptionally busy at the London,

08:44.360 --> 08:46.519
especially with regard to
general surgery.

08:46.520 --> 08:47.760
Yes, Matron.

08:48.960 --> 08:50.839
Take this to the laundry,

08:50.840 --> 08:53.120
so that you can be fitted
with the proper uniform.

08:54.280 --> 08:55.999
And you needn't look askance.

08:56.000 --> 08:58.439
They were designed
by Norman Hartnell -

08:58.440 --> 09:01.000
they're practically couture.
Yes, Matron.

09:04.960 --> 09:08.039
We can't manage without Nurse Lee!

09:08.040 --> 09:12.959
Nurse Noakes has only just left us,
and Jane, who is most welcome,

09:12.960 --> 09:16.079
is neither use nor ornament
without some proper training.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.679
The London's need is greater
than ours, Sister.

09:18.680 --> 09:22.159
And I can assure you,
Jane will be very useful indeed.

09:22.160 --> 09:24.440
Luncheon is served.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.239
Now that looks rather novel.

09:28.240 --> 09:32.959
Avocado pears. I found the serving
suggestion in a magazine.

09:32.960 --> 09:35.199
It's a dressing of olive oil.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.719
What if someone gets earache,

09:36.720 --> 09:39.319
and we've used up
all our medical supplies?

09:39.320 --> 09:41.559
I bought this especially.
From Boots.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.559
And the pears are from the market,

09:43.560 --> 09:45.119
the stall run by those twins.

09:45.120 --> 09:48.719
Meg and Mave?
I think the surname's Carter.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.999
One of them is pregnant.
I don't know which.

09:52.000 --> 09:55.239
One imagines their husband
is equally perplexed.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.799
THEIR husband?

09:56.800 --> 10:00.079
It was the most unusual of weddings.

10:00.080 --> 10:02.999
Singular, in fact,
in its very doubleness.

10:03.000 --> 10:06.959
The sisters walked up the aisle
together, as though each was

10:06.960 --> 10:08.720
giving the other sister away.

10:10.480 --> 10:13.520
And their egress was not dissimilar.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.240
Except a man was walking
in between them.

10:18.640 --> 10:20.159
I am of the view

10:20.160 --> 10:22.239
that on the balance

10:22.240 --> 10:23.760
I should prefer spam.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.320
Don't worry.
We don't eat like this every day.

10:29.320 --> 10:30.680
I don't mind it.

10:34.520 --> 10:37.919
I say! You're not the girl
we've borrowed for male surgical?

10:37.920 --> 10:39.879
Yes, I am. I'm Jenny Lee.

10:39.880 --> 10:42.599
Patsy Mount. I was on late lunch
and they had the porter fetch me.

10:42.600 --> 10:46.839
Mr Tracey's brought his ward
round forward, and there won't be a

10:46.840 --> 10:48.279
Isn't it visiting time?

10:48.280 --> 10:49.879
It would appear he's forgotten.

10:49.880 --> 10:53.560
Or, more likely, he simply
doesn't care. This way.

10:57.160 --> 11:00.160
Come here, let's have a little look,
see what you've got.

11:05.520 --> 11:06.960
We're looking for a nurse.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.440
The small one.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.959
Hello. It's Mrs Carter, isn't it?
Yeah.

11:17.960 --> 11:20.080
She's got scourge of the bladder.

11:21.480 --> 11:23.399
Well, it's very nice to see you.

11:23.400 --> 11:27.200
There's a cubicle just come free.
Step this way.

11:35.240 --> 11:36.960
We don't want nothing meddled with.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.959
Why don't you help
your sister onto the bed

11:40.960 --> 11:42.680
and I'll pop and fetch a doctor?

11:49.320 --> 11:50.719
You seen this?

11:50.720 --> 11:53.600
Yes, Meg. Same as you have.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.880
All lined up.

12:01.960 --> 12:04.040
They're just waiting for their chance.

12:06.200 --> 12:09.519
Give those wheels a kick, we need to
have them all pointing forwards.

12:09.520 --> 12:12.919
And there's to be nothing
whatsoever on the lockers.

12:12.920 --> 12:17.159
What about ashtrays?
Mr Gillespie! You know the rules.

12:17.160 --> 12:19.199
You can only
smoke during visiting hours.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.879
If I don't smoke,
I can't clear my catarrh.

12:21.880 --> 12:25.679
I'll end up on the chest ward.
Just make sure you take me

12:25.680 --> 12:27.640
Nurse Mount,
where's the patient from B?

12:27.641 --> 12:29.959
Khazi. I thought he had the trots,

12:29.960 --> 12:31.838
but he says it's the other way around.

12:31.839 --> 12:33.278
Even after that suppository.

12:33.279 --> 12:35.480
I'll give you a suppository
if you don't button it!

12:36.520 --> 12:38.279
Any luck? I've told you.

12:38.280 --> 12:41.080
When I get lucky, I'll come
out of there doing a victory roll!

12:42.480 --> 12:44.039
Jimmy?

12:44.040 --> 12:45.160
Hello, Jenny.

12:46.160 --> 12:47.360
Do you come here often?

12:47.361 --> 12:50.360
Ward round.
Why is this patient out of bed?

12:53.120 --> 12:56.919
I shall examine this patient in the
classic way - inspection, palpation,

12:56.920 --> 13:00.960
auscultation, percussion -
whilst enquiring about his symptoms.

13:07.000 --> 13:09.759
Any further abdominal pains?

13:09.760 --> 13:11.120
They've eased a bit.

13:12.400 --> 13:13.480
Any vomiting?

13:14.680 --> 13:15.920
Not since yesterday.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.840
Any bowel movement? No.

13:21.160 --> 13:23.079
Any wedding nerves?

13:23.080 --> 13:24.280
No.

13:25.440 --> 13:29.440
It has been known for the prospect
of the altar to bring on the

13:31.480 --> 13:32.600
Nurse!

13:35.120 --> 13:36.679
I shall spare you the knife.

13:36.680 --> 13:39.120
It'll waste my time,
and make you late for church.

13:39.121 --> 13:40.959
You may pack your bags.

13:40.960 --> 13:44.320
I recommend castor oil,
and a stiff Scotch for your nerves.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.199
You're going ahead with it, then?

13:51.200 --> 13:52.959
The decent thing? Yes.

13:52.960 --> 13:55.200
Jen, did you think I wouldn't?

13:57.040 --> 13:58.200
Nurse!

14:01.720 --> 14:06.639
You're a little bit older
than we'd like to be having

14:06.640 --> 14:09.039
but we're going to take
very good care of you.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.679
Just the usual test for today,

14:11.680 --> 14:14.399
then we can plan for delivery
in the maternity home.

14:14.400 --> 14:17.599
Oh, no. We know what goes on
in them lying-in places.

14:17.600 --> 14:19.159
Women die like flies.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.480
I think you'll find
that in the present day, Mrs...?

14:21.481 --> 14:23.480
Carter. Both of them.

14:24.640 --> 14:28.319
Standards of hygiene are higher,
and maternal death rates lower,

14:28.320 --> 14:31.399
than they've ever been.
We never said nothing about hygiene.

14:31.400 --> 14:32.719
Or death rates.

14:32.720 --> 14:34.840
I've only got scourge of the bladder.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.999
He's just out to petrify you.
Come on.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.239
Excuse me,
but you're standing in our way.

14:42.240 --> 14:44.279
All we want is to make sure you,
and your baby,

14:44.280 --> 14:46.279
receive the best care we can give you.

14:46.280 --> 14:49.480
As long as we let you slice her
up with knives? Come on.

14:52.320 --> 14:55.079
One of them wants help
or neither would have come.

14:55.080 --> 14:58.279
And one of them doesn't,
or neither would have left.

14:58.280 --> 15:02.039
They do seem very dependent
on each other, even for twins.

15:02.040 --> 15:04.199
Meg was the first born.

15:04.200 --> 15:09.439
She howled like a wild thing
until Mave was laid beside her,

15:09.440 --> 15:11.080
then both fell silent.

15:13.400 --> 15:17.239
It's as well they clung so close,

15:17.240 --> 15:20.760
as neither we nor the doctor had
the means to save the mother.

15:22.240 --> 15:23.480
Did she haemorrhage?

15:25.000 --> 15:27.120
I know not why you're asking me,

15:28.280 --> 15:31.320
since you once denounced my memory
in a court of law.

15:34.520 --> 15:37.479
We buried her in the snow.

15:37.480 --> 15:38.920
I recollect that.

15:40.120 --> 15:44.399
Nobody is going to be buried in snow
or otherwise this time around.

15:44.400 --> 15:46.799
But what we do have is
an elderly prima gravida

15:46.800 --> 15:49.519
and what sounds like
a touch of cystitis.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.480
We could help her
if we could only gain her trust.

15:55.360 --> 15:59.439
We must try and visit them at home.
And keep things understated.

15:59.440 --> 16:02.119
Where there is anger,
there is always fear.

16:02.120 --> 16:03.160
Yes, Sister.

16:05.760 --> 16:06.920
Knock, knock.

16:08.680 --> 16:13.239
I just have to do your
routine checks for the final time.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.919
If you have a fever,
we can't discharge you.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.240
That would be a shame.

16:19.880 --> 16:21.199
Open wide.

16:21.200 --> 16:25.239
If it means you can't ask me
about my bowels, I'll gladly do it.

16:25.240 --> 16:27.080
I'm not interested in your bowels.

16:31.920 --> 16:33.720
Is someone coming to fetch you?

16:35.360 --> 16:37.719
Francine.

16:37.720 --> 16:40.160
My beautiful fiancee,
soon to be my bride.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.679
When's the wedding?

16:44.680 --> 16:46.719
Two weeks.

16:46.720 --> 16:48.199
As her mother says,

16:48.200 --> 16:51.639
we've got to get married before
it becomes obvious that...

16:51.640 --> 16:53.200
We've got to get married.

16:55.320 --> 16:57.519
It does happen, Jimmy.

16:57.520 --> 16:58.560
I know.

17:00.000 --> 17:04.839
And if it had happened with somebody
else I'd be more philosophical.

17:09.040 --> 17:11.239
Hello, Francine.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.439
Oh, it's you.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.720
I go to a different clinic now.
The facilities are better.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.279
If you get a move on we can
catch the number 23.

17:20.280 --> 17:21.878
It goes past the caterers'

17:21.880 --> 17:24.439
and I need to talk to them
about the trifle.

17:24.440 --> 17:27.239
It must be rather fun
planning a wedding.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.800
I could do without my leading man
being locked up in this place.

17:34.160 --> 17:36.519
Well, he's entirely
at your disposal now.

17:36.520 --> 17:39.280
Temperature and pulse
are absolutely spot-on.

17:42.600 --> 17:45.799
Maybe if we went back, told them
we wanted the baby at home.

17:45.800 --> 17:48.479
They're out to
get their claws into you.

17:48.480 --> 17:50.360
At least I'd know what to expect.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.639
Empress reversed.

17:56.640 --> 18:00.000
It's the motherhood card.
I don't like that.

18:03.320 --> 18:06.600
Knives and blood. Surgery.

18:09.160 --> 18:11.799
And then the tower,
which means destruction.

18:11.800 --> 18:13.200
That's enough now, Meg.

18:16.160 --> 18:17.959
Death approaches.

18:17.960 --> 18:21.000
The sky darkens, it's the end.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.320
Shuffle them. Cut them again.

18:31.321 --> 18:33.920
You can't change what's
written in the cards, Mave.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.999
All you have to do is leave
the delivery pack with Mrs Carter.

18:45.000 --> 18:46.240
Just the delivery pack.

18:46.241 --> 18:48.279
But don't hand it over on the doorstep.

18:48.280 --> 18:49.799
Just say, very politely,

18:49.800 --> 18:53.199
that you have to hand it
over inside the house. Yes. I see.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.719
Then before you leave,
ask very politely

18:55.720 --> 18:57.519
if you might use the lavatory.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.959
We need to be sure
the facilities are suitable.

18:59.960 --> 19:04.119
Jane does not require you to coach
her in the technique of mendacity!

19:04.120 --> 19:07.719
Her soul is sincere
and she will be trusted.

19:07.720 --> 19:09.159
I hope so.

19:09.160 --> 19:11.720
We have chosen our vanguard well.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.679
Poor you, getting Tracey straight away.

19:25.680 --> 19:28.839
I'd offer to swap, but the lure of
the prostate in theatre three

19:28.840 --> 19:30.879
is just too overwhelming.

19:30.880 --> 19:33.079
Still, it's only
an exploratory laparotomy.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.119
You remember your general set?

19:35.120 --> 19:37.399
Yes, of course.

19:37.400 --> 19:41.279
Oh, dear. Nerves.
Can't say I blame you.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.520
Look, what I always say is,

19:42.521 --> 19:44.959
"Get the first thing right,
you soon calm down."

19:44.960 --> 19:46.000
Right.

20:20.400 --> 20:25.399
Yes? I've brought... It's...

20:25.400 --> 20:27.680
Penguins send you, did they?

20:32.440 --> 20:34.760
Brown paper? What's the use of that?

20:36.400 --> 20:40.279
Waterproof. Saves the mattress...
Don't want it, rubbish.

20:40.280 --> 20:44.399
Don't want it, rubbish. All rubbish.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.800
And tell your cronies
to leave us alone.

20:51.560 --> 20:52.999
You frightened her, Meg.

20:53.000 --> 20:54.520
She's out to frighten you.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.160
Scalpel.

21:08.080 --> 21:09.880
Have I misread the list, Nurse?

21:11.640 --> 21:13.839
It's an exploratory laparotomy, sir.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.040
Then why have you handed me
a 10 blade? I thought...

21:16.041 --> 21:18.040
You're not here to think,
you're here to do.

21:18.041 --> 21:19.719
Get me a 23.

21:19.720 --> 21:22.400
Come on, girl,
I've got a patient on the table.

21:24.920 --> 21:26.799
Scalpel, sir.

21:26.800 --> 21:28.959
Classic upper midline.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.960
From the xyphoid
process down to the umbilicus.

21:40.840 --> 21:42.440
Today, please.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.720
Any thoughts as to
which retractor I should use?

21:49.840 --> 21:51.519
Well?

21:51.520 --> 21:55.359
No, sir. Might I have the temerity
to suggest a Richardson?

21:55.360 --> 21:57.080
Does that meet with your approval?

21:59.680 --> 22:03.759
Oh, step back and let somebody
competent take your place.

22:03.760 --> 22:08.080
Gentlemen, please note you are here
to learn from me, not Nurse.

22:14.520 --> 22:17.240
Nurse. Is something amiss?

22:18.760 --> 22:19.999
No, Matron.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.959
The operation was successful,
there were some adhesions...

22:22.960 --> 22:25.599
I don't require a report from you.

22:25.600 --> 22:28.279
The details will be
logged by senior staff.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.319
Now, I suggest you compose yourself
and go back into theatre.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.439
You still have work to do.
Yes, Matron.

22:33.440 --> 22:36.760
I also suggest that you
pay attention to your tone.

22:39.880 --> 22:43.119
I'm sorry, Matron.
I think I'm too used to midwifery.

22:43.120 --> 22:47.079
No, Nurse. You're too used to
being the expert in the room.

22:47.080 --> 22:50.439
You're not in district practice now.
You're in hospital.

22:50.440 --> 22:51.600
And we respect rank.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.919
Everything is retrievable.

23:01.920 --> 23:04.919
Sister...
You're all of you too profligate.

23:04.920 --> 23:08.599
It is as though neither war left
the faintest mark upon you!

23:08.600 --> 23:12.559
Sister Monica Joan. None of these
items is sterile any more!

23:12.560 --> 23:14.639
She just tore them out of my hands...

23:14.640 --> 23:18.879
Let us put them in the dustbin, and
we can dispose of them safely later.

23:18.880 --> 23:22.119
Meanwhile,
you might go into the parlour

23:22.120 --> 23:24.000
and get on with your handicraft.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.560
Why must you have me
fritter my days away?

23:31.240 --> 23:34.519
You might invite Jane to come with you.

23:34.520 --> 23:35.920
You can keep her company.

23:40.240 --> 23:41.799
Come.

23:41.800 --> 23:44.600
You can advise me on
Pinky and Perky's dungarees.

23:57.480 --> 23:59.240
'You know I'd invite you to the wedding

23:59.241 --> 24:00.760
'if I was allowed to, don't you?'

24:03.760 --> 24:06.520
I suppose I shall have to
take that as a compliment.

24:12.320 --> 24:13.680
It isn't what I want.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.680
I don't want to hear you say that.

24:20.080 --> 24:21.320
Why?

24:23.920 --> 24:26.880
Because you're my friend
and I want you to be happy.

24:35.640 --> 24:36.880
Then...

24:38.360 --> 24:39.560
..come out with me.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.839
One final spin in Lady Chatterley,

24:43.840 --> 24:46.320
before she and I go our separate ways.

24:49.680 --> 24:50.840
Are you selling her?

24:54.920 --> 24:57.600
Francine wants to put
a deposit down on a house.

25:00.680 --> 25:02.080
No wonder you look pale.

25:09.960 --> 25:11.680
I can hear your watch ticking.

25:17.440 --> 25:19.880
I don't think we've ever
sat in such silence before.

25:21.520 --> 25:22.880
Tick, tick, tick.

25:29.240 --> 25:30.360
Saturday.

25:33.040 --> 25:34.480
I'll go out with you then.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.279
Hello, sweetie!

25:59.280 --> 26:01.919
I almost didn't recognise you,
out of that beastly uniform.

26:01.920 --> 26:05.559
You've been shopping, too. New dress.
Going somewhere special?

26:05.560 --> 26:07.719
Only out with a friend. On Saturday.

26:07.720 --> 26:10.039
I've just been for a job interview.

26:10.040 --> 26:11.199
New hospital?

26:11.200 --> 26:13.879
No. At a florist's, in Chelsea.

26:13.880 --> 26:16.439
It'll pay a pittance, but at least
I won't be spending my time

26:16.440 --> 26:19.199
biting my tongue and
trying not to wallop people.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.319
Do you mean Mr Tracey?

26:21.320 --> 26:24.319
You've been with us for a week
and guessed in a trice.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.639
I think that speaks volumes.

26:26.640 --> 26:28.439
Has anyone ever reported him?

26:28.440 --> 26:29.999
He's a surgeon, Jenny!

26:30.000 --> 26:32.799
Nobody knows which way he'll
turn, we're all tiptoeing about,

26:32.800 --> 26:34.240
never able to say what we think.

26:34.241 --> 26:36.879
Especially not what we think about him.

26:36.880 --> 26:39.959
It's as though we're all
involved in some gigantic lie.

26:39.960 --> 26:42.080
And I'm just not dishonest by nature.

26:44.320 --> 26:46.479
Nor am I.

26:46.480 --> 26:47.920
Shall we?

26:57.320 --> 26:59.840
KNOCKING ON DOOR

27:03.720 --> 27:04.760
Evening.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.839
I want to talk to the small one.

27:09.840 --> 27:12.880
She's not here. You'll have to put
up with the big one.

27:14.360 --> 27:15.600
I come on me own.

27:16.720 --> 27:20.319
I slipped out and left
Meg sleeping on the couch.

27:20.320 --> 27:22.680
She reckons she gets more
tired of a night than I do.

27:22.681 --> 27:24.879
That's all very well, Mrs Carter,

27:24.880 --> 27:27.439
but you are the one who is
carrying this baby.

27:27.440 --> 27:29.959
And you are the one who's going to
have to deliver it.

27:29.960 --> 27:33.279
And the best place
for that is in the maternity home.

27:33.280 --> 27:34.600
I don't want her upset!

27:36.520 --> 27:40.319
But I don't want no disasters neither.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.200
Cos that'd upset her even more.

27:43.960 --> 27:47.039
We go together, Meg and me.

27:47.040 --> 27:48.280
We always have done.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.799
Before we was born, we was a pair

27:53.800 --> 27:56.879
and afterwards you couldn't
stick a knife between us.

27:56.880 --> 28:01.359
Well, Mother Nature has stuck
her knife between you this time.

28:01.360 --> 28:04.839
It's not about you and her anymore.

28:04.840 --> 28:07.000
It's about you and your baby.

28:08.600 --> 28:11.880
And you wouldn't be stood here now
if you didn't know that.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.279
All right, look.

28:23.280 --> 28:26.519
When your labour starts,
you send for us.

28:26.520 --> 28:29.119
That is the best thing for your
whole family.

28:29.120 --> 28:33.160
We will come to you.
No ifs, no buts. Do you hear me?

28:41.400 --> 28:43.360
He doesn't want to do it, Cynthia.

28:44.400 --> 28:47.920
He's doing the right thing by her
and I so admire him for it.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.600
But it's the wrong thing for him.

28:52.840 --> 28:55.399
But there must be
something between them.

28:55.400 --> 28:58.840
Otherwise they wouldn't be in
their present situation.

28:59.920 --> 29:01.840
They slept together. Obviously.

29:03.800 --> 29:05.919
That doesn't mean they love each other.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.440
I suppose not.

29:09.360 --> 29:11.920
Cynthia, the two don't always
go hand in hand.

29:15.640 --> 29:18.079
For years and years,
Jimmy was your friend

29:18.080 --> 29:19.720
and no more than your friend.

29:21.680 --> 29:23.040
You have to let him go.

29:24.760 --> 29:27.159
I'm not hanging onto him!

29:27.160 --> 29:29.159
Any more than I hung on to Gerald.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.599
And Gerald was married
when you met him, Jenny.

29:31.600 --> 29:33.520
He was never within your grasp.

29:39.600 --> 29:40.680
No.

29:41.720 --> 29:42.760
He wasn't.

29:47.440 --> 29:50.160
Jimmy belongs to someone else now.

29:51.760 --> 29:57.480
Or he will do soon and if you can't
accept that, things will all be...

29:58.600 --> 30:00.280
..out of order.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.239
I knew I had it tucked away somewhere!

30:04.240 --> 30:08.079
Aid To Theatre Technique
by Balliere, Tindall and Cox.

30:08.080 --> 30:11.919
And what's more, it still smells
of Norman Hartnell's In Love,

30:11.920 --> 30:14.439
which was the scent
I favoured during training.

30:14.440 --> 30:17.079
It will go with your couture uniform.

30:17.080 --> 30:18.280
Thank you.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.799
Yes?

30:29.800 --> 30:33.279
I'm sorry, sir, but Sister asked me
to do Mr Solomon's routine checks.

30:33.280 --> 30:34.520
Yes, of course.

30:41.880 --> 30:45.719
He'll be a new man by the time
we've sent him home.

30:45.720 --> 30:48.759
One of the worst gall bladders
I've taken out.

30:48.760 --> 30:50.280
It's all right, Mr Solomon.

30:51.840 --> 30:53.200
He was complaining of thirst.

30:53.201 --> 30:56.039
I'd give him a sip or two of water,
just to keep him comfortable.

30:56.040 --> 30:57.640
Yes, sir. Thank you, Nurse.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.040
PHONE RINGS

31:29.800 --> 31:30.999
'Jimmy?'

31:31.000 --> 31:32.040
Jen.

31:36.000 --> 31:37.320
I can't see you, Jimmy.

31:38.800 --> 31:39.960
'Not on Saturday.'

31:41.120 --> 31:43.040
Not for a very long time, if ever.

31:47.920 --> 31:50.200
You certainly know how to make
a big pronouncement.

31:50.201 --> 31:52.480
'I'm not making
a big pronouncement.'

31:57.480 --> 31:59.040
I'm doing the decent thing.

32:02.040 --> 32:03.519
I see.

32:03.520 --> 32:05.320
'No, I don't think you can see.'

32:06.400 --> 32:08.000
But I can see...

32:09.520 --> 32:11.560
..if I don't say goodbye now...

32:14.360 --> 32:18.320
..I'll end up re-living something
I want to put behind me.

32:23.720 --> 32:25.800
I can't make the same mistake twice.

32:33.600 --> 32:34.760
All right.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.880
KNOCKING ON DOOR

33:05.080 --> 33:06.120
Can I help you?

33:06.121 --> 33:09.480
It's Mave. Mave Carter.
She's crying out something awful.

33:26.400 --> 33:29.239
This'll move it on. You'll see.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.879
Raspberry leaf.
Ain't nothing like it.

33:32.880 --> 33:35.720
I don't want to move it on. Not yet.

33:38.320 --> 33:41.759
Hello, Mrs Carter, Mrs Carter.

33:41.760 --> 33:43.279
What are you doing here?

33:43.280 --> 33:46.079
Turning the light on, for a start.

33:46.080 --> 33:48.719
Culpepper says it should be
dark in the birthing room.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.839
Yes, but that was years ago.

33:50.840 --> 33:52.560
I'm sure he would have felt differently

33:52.561 --> 33:54.519
if he had electric light.

33:54.520 --> 33:56.960
I need to see what I am doing.
Leave it alone.

34:01.080 --> 34:02.120
Hello, Mave.

34:10.199 --> 34:11.918
What you doing that for?

34:11.920 --> 34:14.279
I'll need to listen to baby's heart.

34:14.280 --> 34:17.239
This is the 1950s, not the 1590s.

34:19.280 --> 34:22.119
Your sister needs to be in bed
so we can examine her properly.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.159
She has to be in the birthing chair.

34:24.159 --> 34:26.080
Dr Turner will be popping round soon

34:26.081 --> 34:28.879
and if he sees your sister in this
contraption he'll drag it out

34:28.880 --> 34:31.799
from under her and chop it up as
firewood! I'll chop him up.

34:31.800 --> 34:33.839
I'm sure you'll do no such thing.

34:33.840 --> 34:36.199
You'll be too busy helping us
with preparations.

34:36.199 --> 34:37.440
Who sent for you?

34:37.440 --> 34:40.000
No-one.
We operate purely on telepathy.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.440
If it was that husband of ours,
I'll kill him.

34:52.159 --> 34:56.199
It was me. I sent for her.

34:57.440 --> 35:02.719
Now please, Meg, hold my hand

35:02.720 --> 35:05.440
and let the midwife do her job.

35:07.920 --> 35:10.959
Breathe through it.

35:10.960 --> 35:13.800
That's fine now,
you're doing just fine.

35:21.160 --> 35:22.679
You'd better get a trolley loaded.

35:22.680 --> 35:24.719
There's an acute abdomen
coming into Theatre 2.

35:24.720 --> 35:27.839
Mr Tracey's been called back.
It's a critical case.

35:27.840 --> 35:30.559
Patient came in by ambulance,
the registrar took one look at him

35:30.560 --> 35:31.838
and referred him up to us.

35:31.839 --> 35:34.198
He says we're looking at
peritonitis if we're lucky.

35:34.199 --> 35:35.358
Or if the patient's lucky.

35:35.359 --> 35:37.120
There's already signs of septicaemia.

35:37.121 --> 35:38.240
SCREAMING

35:40.080 --> 35:41.759
That sounds bad.

35:41.760 --> 35:43.720
It's worse than bad.
We had him in last week

35:43.721 --> 35:45.560
and Tracey discharged him.

35:53.520 --> 35:56.279
Jimmy? Jimmy?
I'll speak to Sister.

35:56.280 --> 35:59.239
I'll bring his notes, and make sure
the anaesthetist's on his way.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.560
It's going to be all right, Jimmy,
you'll be all right.

36:01.561 --> 36:04.839
It isn't, Jenny. It isn't!
And I knew it wasn't all along.

36:04.840 --> 36:06.199
I just knew.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.759
Just try to breathe for me, Jimmy,

36:08.760 --> 36:10.759
and keep calm.

36:10.760 --> 36:13.759
Just keep breathing.
Just keep breathing.

36:13.760 --> 36:15.640
Jenny. What's septicaemia?

36:17.000 --> 36:19.879
Evening, Nurse.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.639
Is this the abdomen?

36:21.640 --> 36:23.519
Mr James Wilson, sir.

36:23.520 --> 36:25.238
He was here last week under observation

36:25.239 --> 36:26.720
for a suspected appendix.

36:26.721 --> 36:28.719
Why was he discharged?

36:28.720 --> 36:31.319
You felt it was unnecessary
to keep him in, sir.

36:31.320 --> 36:34.599
Nurse Mount has gone to
fetch your notes.

36:34.600 --> 36:37.239
Very well.
I'll need someone to scrub.

36:37.240 --> 36:41.160
I'll do it, sir. I'd prefer somebody
else. There is no-one else, sir.

36:42.160 --> 36:43.480
If I don't give satisfaction,

36:43.481 --> 36:46.320
perhaps one of your students
can take over.

36:52.960 --> 36:55.160
Don't leave me, Jenny.

36:56.320 --> 36:57.360
I won't.

37:22.840 --> 37:26.479
I'll stand back, shall I,
while you take the floor?

37:26.480 --> 37:28.440
I don't think that would be
very wise, sir.

37:28.441 --> 37:31.479
I spoke in jest, I hope you did to.
Yes, sir.

37:31.480 --> 37:34.760
Because insolence is
a dismissible offence. Scalpel.

37:59.160 --> 38:00.200
Retractor.

38:09.960 --> 38:12.279
They always said
they was born with a gap

38:12.280 --> 38:14.480
and that they filled it for each other.

38:15.720 --> 38:18.520
But you're going to have
a little nephew or niece.

38:20.520 --> 38:22.080
That's her baby.

38:23.080 --> 38:24.720
She won't have a gap no more.

38:28.320 --> 38:31.119
I'll find somewhere of me own.

38:31.120 --> 38:32.879
Leave you three in peace.

38:32.880 --> 38:34.639
You don't have to do that!

38:34.640 --> 38:37.959
Everything's changed.
Nothing's the same.

38:37.960 --> 38:39.880
It's not the end of the world,
Meg, girl.

38:39.881 --> 38:42.440
It's the end of the way
that things have been.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.999
Meg came first. She was no trouble.

38:54.000 --> 38:56.720
Me, I was the wrong way round.

38:58.880 --> 39:01.280
Our mother was our age when she had us.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.040
I was the death of her.

39:06.680 --> 39:10.599
Since then, it's been me
and Meg against the world.

39:10.600 --> 39:13.480
And Meg will love this baby
just as much as you.

39:16.560 --> 39:19.519
Now it's finally happening,

39:19.520 --> 39:22.199
all I can see is trouble.

39:22.200 --> 39:23.639
Oh!

39:23.640 --> 39:25.759
I really do think that on your
next contraction

39:25.760 --> 39:28.439
you ought to try a whiff of gas, Mave.

39:28.440 --> 39:31.799
You might find it just
takes the edge off.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.399
I want Meg.

39:33.400 --> 39:36.119
Soon. I should think she's
busy making up the cot.

39:36.120 --> 39:38.239
It's going in a drawer.

39:38.240 --> 39:41.000
A drawer out of our mother's
old chest, same as we did.

39:45.520 --> 39:48.639
Waters still intact.
All going along like clockwork.

39:48.640 --> 39:49.960
Just the way I like it.

39:54.400 --> 39:58.440
Breathe deeply. In and out.

40:00.160 --> 40:04.520
Very well,
we have an infarction of the bowel.

40:05.520 --> 40:08.119
So we'll have to excise and then resect

40:08.120 --> 40:10.639
using end-to-end anastomosis.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.679
I suspect the gangrene
was caused by adhesions

40:13.680 --> 40:15.160
cutting off the blood supply.

40:15.161 --> 40:17.279
We'll need to start
penicillin straight away

40:17.280 --> 40:19.319
or the poor bastard
won't have a chance.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.200
I'll need two sets of Moynihans.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.600
Moynihans or Parker-Kerrs, sir?

40:29.120 --> 40:31.200
Well, on the balance...

40:32.600 --> 40:34.679
..Parker-Kerrs might be preferable.

40:34.680 --> 40:35.720
Yes, sir.

40:45.120 --> 40:49.439
Don't push, Mavis,
just concentrate on your breathing.

40:49.440 --> 40:53.919
We want baby's head to be born
slowly. And here it comes.

40:53.920 --> 40:56.279
Don't push. Just breathe.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.399
Breathe.

40:58.400 --> 40:59.720
There we are.

41:01.360 --> 41:04.279
Baby's head is born.

41:04.280 --> 41:08.319
I want Meg. I want my sister.

41:08.320 --> 41:10.479
Would you like to step forward, Doctor,

41:10.480 --> 41:13.040
so you can hand baby to mother
when it's born?

41:20.920 --> 41:24.239
Deep breaths, Mavis! Deep breaths!

41:24.240 --> 41:27.640
Come on now.
You're doing really, really well.

41:30.840 --> 41:33.559
That's it, that's it,
that's it, that's it.

41:33.560 --> 41:35.520
And there we are!

41:36.920 --> 41:39.159
Tiny, and completely perfect.

41:39.160 --> 41:42.760
Congratulations, Mrs Carter,
you have a little girl.

41:47.160 --> 41:49.759
Meg'll be pleased.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.599
We never did like boys.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.280
BABY GURGLES

42:12.840 --> 42:13.880
Will you get her?

42:18.720 --> 42:21.080
There is such a thing as
being ready for visitors.

42:21.081 --> 42:23.479
I want my sister.

42:23.480 --> 42:27.799
I'll go through
and announce the glad tidings,

42:27.800 --> 42:30.160
and then she can come in.

42:31.320 --> 42:36.119
I want Meg! Why hasn't she come?

42:36.120 --> 42:38.000
She must have heard the baby cry.

42:40.320 --> 42:42.919
Sure you won't have a drop
of something in that, Doctor?

42:42.920 --> 42:45.800
Go on, I'll indulge myself
as I'm about to go home.

42:46.880 --> 42:50.840
So. All's well
and you have a niece!

42:52.040 --> 42:54.719
Mave'll be pleased.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.720
We never did like boys.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.000
Doctor, can you come through at once?

43:12.640 --> 43:15.799
Twins. It explains
the small first baby.

43:15.800 --> 43:18.839
And the slow third stage.
No placenta yet.

43:18.840 --> 43:23.079
There was never any sign of twins.
Never any inkling.

43:23.080 --> 43:25.839
You'll manage splendidly,
just as you did with the first.

43:25.840 --> 43:28.839
I won't manage.
Any more than our mother did.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.199
I want Meg.

43:30.200 --> 43:32.599
You'll be absolutely fine, Mave.
I want her.

43:32.600 --> 43:34.039
What's the lie?

43:34.040 --> 43:35.480
Transverse.

43:36.720 --> 43:40.159
Mavis, I'm afraid baby's
misbehaving slightly,

43:40.160 --> 43:42.399
and lying sideways on, instead
of head down. No.

43:42.400 --> 43:45.559
Don't worry. Sister Bernadette's
going to have it out in no time.

43:45.560 --> 43:46.960
The waters aren't broken.

43:46.961 --> 43:49.479
The presenting part
looks like the right shoulder.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.959
I'm going to have to try
an external version.

43:51.960 --> 43:53.920
We're going to need to
turn the baby round

43:53.921 --> 43:55.920
so that it can be born more easily.

43:55.921 --> 43:58.599
I can't do it again. I can't!

43:58.600 --> 44:01.119
We're going to be with you every
step of the way, Mavis.

44:01.120 --> 44:02.879
Trust us.

44:02.880 --> 44:04.439
This will hurt

44:04.440 --> 44:07.720
but I just want you to hold tight
to Nurse Franklin's hand.

44:09.720 --> 44:11.560
Look at me, Mave, look at me.

44:19.240 --> 44:21.719
There's a girl. There's a girl.

44:21.720 --> 44:26.039
Deep breaths. Deep breaths now,
deep breaths.

44:26.040 --> 44:27.560
Deep breaths.

44:29.440 --> 44:32.399
That's great. You're doing
so well, Mave, you're doing so well.

44:32.400 --> 44:34.079
Nearly there! Nearly there!

44:34.080 --> 44:35.400
SHE GROANS

44:39.040 --> 44:41.479
Sister's turned the baby round,
Mrs Carter.

44:41.480 --> 44:43.079
It's in the correct position now.

44:43.080 --> 44:46.520
We'll need to rupture the membranes
so the head can engage.

44:47.520 --> 44:51.000
Lift your legs up for me, Mave.
There's a girl. And the other one.

44:55.920 --> 44:58.120
You're doing really well, Mrs Carter.

45:08.080 --> 45:11.559
Pitocin, point five of a mil.

45:11.560 --> 45:14.440
Let's see if we
can get a contraction going.

45:18.400 --> 45:20.199
The placenta is coming away.

45:20.200 --> 45:22.159
We need to get this baby out now.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.960
Mavis, come to the edge of the bed.

45:23.961 --> 45:26.719
She needs to be in the
lithotomy position.

45:26.720 --> 45:29.120
Lift up for us, Mave.
There's a girl.

45:31.120 --> 45:33.240
Knees right up to your chest, sweetie.

45:34.320 --> 45:37.359
Sorry, Mave, there's not much
dignity in childbirth.

45:37.360 --> 45:40.319
We're going to give you some help,
Mrs Carter.

45:40.320 --> 45:43.039
I'm going to deliver
the baby using forceps

45:43.040 --> 45:46.800
and you just need to stay as still
as you can until we tell you push.

45:47.840 --> 45:51.159
Keep those legs steady for me.

45:51.160 --> 45:52.600
Fundal pressure, please.

45:55.520 --> 45:56.560
Ow! Shhhh.

46:01.400 --> 46:03.960
SHE SOBS

46:05.120 --> 46:08.000
Grab hold of my arm
and push with all of your might.

46:09.240 --> 46:12.640
Aaargh! Aaargh!

46:15.120 --> 46:17.119
That's enough! Get off me.

46:17.120 --> 46:20.039
No, Mrs Carter, no!

46:20.040 --> 46:21.480
TRIXIE: Deep breaths now, Mave.

46:21.481 --> 46:25.679
Mrs Carter, we are doing all we
can for your sister and her baby.

46:25.680 --> 46:29.479
If you interfere again,
you will lose one or the other.

46:29.480 --> 46:31.679
I can't rule out that you
might lose both.

46:31.680 --> 46:33.280
TRIXIE: Come here, Meg.

46:36.640 --> 46:40.560
TRIXIE: That's right. Hold her hand
and just try to calm her down.

46:41.680 --> 46:44.679
TRIXIE: Mave needs you now, Meg,
more than she ever has.

46:44.680 --> 46:47.360
I'm here now. I'm here.

46:48.720 --> 46:50.319
Push now.

46:50.320 --> 46:52.000
Come on! Come on!

46:54.200 --> 46:55.400
Again.

46:58.000 --> 46:59.440
That's it, that's it.

47:01.000 --> 47:03.279
With the next contraction, Mave...

47:03.280 --> 47:05.239
I ain't got nothing left.

47:05.240 --> 47:09.480
You ain't giving up now, Mave.
You got my strength too.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.239
And you take it.

47:13.240 --> 47:15.480
Cos it ain't going to be no use
to me if I ain't got you.

47:15.481 --> 47:17.879
TRIXIE: That's it. Again!

47:17.880 --> 47:20.319
That's it! That's it!

47:20.320 --> 47:25.879
That's it, Mave! That's it!
That's it! That's it! That's it!

47:25.880 --> 47:29.240
That's it! That's it! That's it!
Another girl.

47:41.560 --> 47:42.640
Mucus extractor.

47:46.680 --> 47:48.439
Why isn't it crying?

47:48.440 --> 47:50.639
Placenta's coming.

47:50.640 --> 47:51.800
Haemorrhage.

47:55.280 --> 47:56.520
Ergometrine, please.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.519
We need to stabilise her
then get her to hospital.

48:00.520 --> 48:02.319
She's white as paper.

48:02.320 --> 48:04.279
We're doing all we can, Meg.

48:04.280 --> 48:07.999
You hold on there, girl.
You hold on.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.999
50 mils of Ergometrine, Nurse Franklin.

48:10.000 --> 48:12.679
TRIXIE: 50 mils, Doctor.
Good. Now go and ring the hospital.

48:12.680 --> 48:15.279
We need an obstetric flying squad
ambulance. Right away.

48:15.280 --> 48:18.840
I'm going to have to try Eve's
rocking. I'll be as quick as I can.

49:04.240 --> 49:05.399
BABY GURGLES

49:05.400 --> 49:06.440
Praise the Lord.

49:40.120 --> 49:42.000
Give her to my sister.

49:54.080 --> 49:56.080
What you going to call yours, then?

49:57.720 --> 50:00.119
Little Mave, of course.

50:00.120 --> 50:01.280
Hello, Little Mave.

50:04.240 --> 50:07.840
This here's your sister, Little Meg.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.239
Oh, my goodness!

50:15.240 --> 50:19.240
Crisis over.
Mother and both babies doing well.

50:48.120 --> 50:50.679
Tick, tick, tick.

50:50.680 --> 50:51.720
Yes.

50:57.160 --> 51:00.360
You're going to be all right,
Jimmy. I promise you.

51:03.120 --> 51:04.920
I should have put up a fight.

51:06.520 --> 51:07.879
What for?

51:07.880 --> 51:08.960
For you.

51:11.160 --> 51:12.680
No.

51:15.360 --> 51:16.880
I'm standing by Francine.

51:20.080 --> 51:21.480
But you stood by me.

51:24.280 --> 51:25.839
Up there.

51:25.840 --> 51:27.359
I'm a nurse, Jimmy.

51:27.360 --> 51:28.720
You're more than that.

51:30.200 --> 51:31.240
Shh.

51:33.040 --> 51:35.280
You're everything.

51:36.400 --> 51:38.440
Always put up the fight, Jen.

51:41.240 --> 51:43.120
You never know what you may lose.

51:56.280 --> 52:00.319
We're like an officer and a sergeant
the morning after the Somme.

52:00.320 --> 52:03.320
And that's not to say
I see myself as the officer.

52:06.280 --> 52:08.880
I feel as though I should
offer you one.

52:10.840 --> 52:12.639
Just a puff.

52:12.640 --> 52:13.839
Of this?

52:13.840 --> 52:15.240
Quickly. Just a wee one.

52:19.600 --> 52:21.079
Ooh, what are these?

52:21.080 --> 52:22.799
Henleys.

52:22.800 --> 52:26.039
Henleys! I loved Henleys.

52:26.040 --> 52:28.679
They were the kind
my father used to smoke.

52:28.680 --> 52:32.360
I used to sneak one out of his desk
sometimes when I was about 14.

52:36.400 --> 52:37.639
Thank you.

52:37.640 --> 52:38.680
You've earned it.

53:00.960 --> 53:02.000
Come in.

53:14.720 --> 53:18.319
Matron. I need to talk to
you about Mr Tracey.

53:18.320 --> 53:19.480
Is this a complaint?

53:21.120 --> 53:22.999
No.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.560
But it is a concern.

53:27.360 --> 53:30.839
Mr Tracey is driving people
out of that department.

53:30.840 --> 53:33.399
He is irascible and short-tempered.

53:33.400 --> 53:34.639
Nurse.

53:34.640 --> 53:38.360
You may continue only if you have
something illuminating to say.

53:40.480 --> 53:42.439
He's making mistakes.

53:42.440 --> 53:45.359
You are referring to
the acute abdomen, I presume?

53:45.360 --> 53:47.360
Mr James Wilson?

53:48.560 --> 53:50.319
When Mr Tracey discharged him,

53:50.320 --> 53:54.119
he missed out one of the stages
of abdominal examination.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.679
You are sure of this?

53:55.680 --> 53:57.399
Yes, Matron.

53:57.400 --> 53:59.959
He missed out auscultation.

53:59.960 --> 54:01.840
If he had listened
with his stethoscope,

54:01.841 --> 54:05.279
he might have noticed
the absence of bowel sounds.

54:05.280 --> 54:06.799
Combined with vomiting

54:06.800 --> 54:10.119
and constipation that would have
pointed to intestinal obstruction.

54:10.120 --> 54:13.680
It would have made all the
difference to Jimmy... to Mr Wilson.

54:14.720 --> 54:17.159
I cannot disagree with that.

54:17.160 --> 54:20.560
He seems to have constant
small lapses of memory.

54:22.320 --> 54:24.840
I've also noticed a tremor in his hand.

54:26.760 --> 54:30.479
In district practice, we're used to
seeing a wide range of illness

54:30.480 --> 54:34.760
and I was reminded of symptoms
I've seen in neurological disease.

54:37.480 --> 54:39.160
Including Parkinson's.

54:40.720 --> 54:41.760
I see.

54:44.320 --> 54:48.039
Mr Tracey reported to
the hospital board this morning.

54:48.040 --> 54:50.439
He has had his own suspicions.

54:50.440 --> 54:52.679
He has taken a voluntary
leave of absence

54:52.680 --> 54:55.679
so that he might have tests
and receive a diagnosis.

54:55.680 --> 54:57.159
I'm so sorry, Matron.

54:57.160 --> 54:59.560
I know I need not say that
this is all in confidence.

54:59.561 --> 55:02.199
No, Matron. I know,
because you have intelligence

55:02.200 --> 55:05.280
and sensitivity as well
as common sense.

55:07.040 --> 55:08.920
Do you enjoy district practice?

55:10.200 --> 55:12.560
Yes. And not just the midwifery.

55:14.160 --> 55:19.119
If, in due course, Nurse Lee, you
wanted to come back here and start

55:19.120 --> 55:22.680
working your way up the ladder,
I'd be very pleased to have you.

55:51.600 --> 55:54.879
MATURE JENNY: 'Sometimes only
when bonds are tested

55:54.880 --> 55:57.800
'do we understand their strength.

56:06.160 --> 56:09.639
'There are ties that
endure for a lifetime

56:09.640 --> 56:12.040
'no matter how frayed by fate.

56:14.800 --> 56:19.039
'We can walk away
and pretend that we forget them.

56:19.040 --> 56:22.320
'Pain passes in the end.

56:40.120 --> 56:43.240
'Or we can step into the future...

56:48.320 --> 56:51.399
'..blessed and stronger
than before because,

56:51.400 --> 56:55.440
'when faced with change, our love
held fast and did not break.

57:00.040 --> 57:02.240
'Our lives were not severed
but woven anew...

57:07.600 --> 57:11.200
'..and our joy not halved
but doubled.'

57:30.960 --> 57:32.399
And you are...?

57:32.400 --> 57:35.039
The Reverend Applebee-Thornton...

57:35.040 --> 57:36.159
Jane.

57:36.160 --> 57:40.680
Is that Ruby's baby or is there
something you haven't told us?

57:42.040 --> 57:45.559
'I knew, one day, I would
encounter something like this.'

57:45.560 --> 57:48.159
But I feel so under-prepared,
Sister.

57:48.160 --> 57:50.559
I bet you're a wonderful dancer.

57:50.560 --> 57:52.240
Is Jane agreed?
