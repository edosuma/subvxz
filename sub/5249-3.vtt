WEBVTT

00:01.275 --> 00:02.672
The Carmichael Show is taped

00:02.673 --> 00:04.295
in front of a live studio audience.

00:04.296 --> 00:05.981
So, I was on a walk, Maxine,

00:05.982 --> 00:07.349
and I had this epiphany on the walk.

00:07.350 --> 00:08.982
I noticed that you can tell how nice

00:08.983 --> 00:11.651
your neighborhood is by, like,
the litter that's on the ground.

00:11.652 --> 00:13.486
And congratulations, Maxine, 'cause we live

00:13.487 --> 00:15.321
in a pretty nice neighborhood, all right?

00:15.322 --> 00:16.823
It was like a ATM receipt.

00:16.824 --> 00:18.525
I saw a bag from the Apple Store.

00:18.526 --> 00:21.461
On my way in, I stepped over
an unused condom, Maxine.

00:21.462 --> 00:24.430
It was a... it was a
condom, and it wasn't used.

00:24.431 --> 00:27.901
Now, where I grew up, we had scary litter.

00:27.902 --> 00:30.637
There's only so many bags
of Flaming Hot Cheetos

00:30.638 --> 00:34.874
a man can see before he knows
he's about to be murdered.

00:34.875 --> 00:36.376
I get it. People-people get murdered.

00:36.377 --> 00:37.877
- Yeah.
- Um, can you hand me that?

00:37.878 --> 00:40.046
What are you making here,
by the way? What was...?

00:40.047 --> 00:41.414
- Cheesy potatoes?
- Yes.

00:41.415 --> 00:42.882
A-a rib-eye?

00:42.883 --> 00:44.517
Maxine, you don't eat like this.

00:44.518 --> 00:45.752
Your parents do.

00:45.753 --> 00:47.720
Oh, so, now you want
to live like my parents?

00:47.721 --> 00:49.189
Jerrod, I've been trying to figure out

00:49.190 --> 00:51.291
why I haven't really connected
with your parents, and I think

00:51.292 --> 00:53.660
it's because I'm not the
traditional homemaker,

00:53.661 --> 00:56.429
take-care-of-my-man type
of woman that they expect.

00:56.430 --> 00:57.997
Mm-hmm.

00:57.998 --> 01:01.000
So I'm just gonna try a new tactic.

01:01.001 --> 01:03.636
I'm just gonna not act like myself anymore.

01:03.637 --> 01:06.339
Look, this is the first time
that they're coming over,

01:06.340 --> 01:08.174
and I want them to like me.

01:08.175 --> 01:10.476
My family... you know, they're
all divorced and dysfunctional.

01:10.477 --> 01:11.911
I like your family.

01:11.912 --> 01:14.113
They're all close and on top of each other.

01:14.114 --> 01:16.716
I know you think you're
describing a good thing, Maxine,

01:16.717 --> 01:18.218
but what you just described

01:18.219 --> 01:21.387
is how homeless people live.

01:21.388 --> 01:23.122
Plus, I'm adding a new dish.

01:23.123 --> 01:24.457
What? Whoa, whoa.

01:24.458 --> 01:26.025
No. Is that kale?

01:26.026 --> 01:28.194
No, that doesn't go with
anything that I'm cooking.

01:28.195 --> 01:31.397
I... Maybe I can cream it or fry it.

01:31.398 --> 01:34.567
Or maybe you could cream it,
then bread it, then fry it.

01:34.568 --> 01:35.501
- Ooh.
- Ooh.

01:35.502 --> 01:37.704
No. No, Maxine. No.

01:37.705 --> 01:39.472
My parents eat horrible, okay?

01:39.473 --> 01:41.274
Really bad. I'm always trying
to get 'em to eat better.

01:41.275 --> 01:42.909
You know, when I was
little, my mom would say,

01:42.910 --> 01:45.879
"If I cooked, and it's on the
table, you're going to eat it."

01:45.880 --> 01:47.180
Now it's my turn.

01:47.181 --> 01:50.216
Okay, well, your parents
are not gonna eat kale.

01:50.217 --> 01:53.319
Well, it's not just
kale. It's a kale salad.

01:55.256 --> 01:56.756
- Hey.
- Aah!

01:56.757 --> 01:59.359
We're here for Sunday Fun-Day!

01:59.360 --> 02:00.994
I'm at the boy's now.

02:00.995 --> 02:02.595
All right, I'll see you at work.

02:02.596 --> 02:04.430
All right. All right.

02:04.431 --> 02:06.566
All right.

02:06.567 --> 02:07.834
- Dad!
- I'll see you at work.

02:07.835 --> 02:09.068
All right, all right, all right.

02:09.068 --> 02:10.803
You know I got free nights and weekends.

02:10.804 --> 02:12.505
I got to get these calls in.

02:12.506 --> 02:15.040
Hi, Maxine.

02:15.875 --> 02:18.244
Hello. Welcome!

02:18.245 --> 02:20.346
Thank you. It's so nice of you, Maxine,

02:20.347 --> 02:23.815
to invite us over to Jerrod's apartment.

02:25.351 --> 02:27.153
Ma, you know Maxine lives here now.

02:27.154 --> 02:29.088
Oh. Well, it does look different.

02:29.089 --> 02:30.890
Uh, yeah, I hung up a few pictures

02:30.891 --> 02:32.058
and I repainted the walls.

02:32.059 --> 02:33.893
Painted? Why'd you go and do that?

02:33.894 --> 02:35.361
'Cause it was a color.

02:35.362 --> 02:37.864
It was a color, and she
wanted it a different color.

02:37.865 --> 02:39.985
You know her family has
trouble sticking to one color.

02:42.469 --> 02:43.770
He was gonna do it anyway.

02:43.771 --> 02:45.471
- I was.
- He was gonna do it.

02:45.472 --> 02:47.840
He was.

02:47.841 --> 02:50.376
Here's you a little housewarming gift.

02:50.377 --> 02:52.577
Oh. Thanks.

02:53.980 --> 02:57.183
Okay, why doesn't everyone
just, uh, take a seat

02:57.184 --> 02:58.885
and I will bring out the appetizers?

02:58.886 --> 03:01.153
- Oh.
- Where's the head of the table?

03:04.390 --> 03:06.492
Dad, it's a... it's a square table.

03:06.493 --> 03:08.061
I don't think there's a head.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.996
There's always a head.
Where are you gonna sit?

03:09.997 --> 03:11.897
- I'm sitting here.
- Not anymore.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.235
All right, here we go.

03:16.236 --> 03:19.538
Oh, you gonna feed us one bite at a time.

03:21.274 --> 03:23.643
It's just a little
bacon-wrapped shrimp to start.

03:23.644 --> 03:25.745
- Okay.
- Well, all right. That's two things I like.

03:25.746 --> 03:27.847
- Yeah.
- All done.

03:27.848 --> 03:30.049
- How many more do I get?
- Oh.

03:30.050 --> 03:33.519
As many as you like, Joe.

03:33.520 --> 03:35.989
Joe, this is actually pretty good.

03:35.990 --> 03:37.824
She didn't Maxine it.

03:37.825 --> 03:39.459
What?

03:39.460 --> 03:40.560
Maxine it?

03:40.561 --> 03:43.196
Oh, it's just a little thing we say.

03:43.197 --> 03:45.430
When you made something bad.

03:46.399 --> 03:47.834
But we said you didn't do that,

03:47.835 --> 03:49.869
so be proud of yourself, girl.

03:49.870 --> 03:52.005
Oprah got arrested yesterday.

03:52.006 --> 03:54.941
Oh, no! Gayle, too?

03:54.942 --> 03:56.909
Yup, yup, yup, Gayle,
too, Mama. Ponzi schemes.

03:56.910 --> 03:59.045
Hold-hold on.

03:59.046 --> 04:00.847
You mean to tell me that Oprah Winfrey

04:00.848 --> 04:05.283
and-and Gayle, uh... Winfrey got...

04:07.320 --> 04:11.157
...got arrested in a Ponzi scheme?

04:11.158 --> 04:12.859
Bobby, I told you to come up

04:12.860 --> 04:16.060
with a believable excuse
to get us out of here.

04:18.865 --> 04:21.767
Dad, you said to make the
lie undeniable, and I did.

04:21.769 --> 04:24.570
Son, Oprah would never get arrested.

04:24.571 --> 04:26.572
She is an angel that walks the earth.

04:26.573 --> 04:28.907
She is the reason black
people wake up in the morning.

04:48.807 --> 04:50.932
Boy, these cheesy things is dead on.

04:50.933 --> 04:52.667
- Mmm.
- That taste like Cynthia's, only different.

04:52.668 --> 04:53.935
I can't put my finger on it.

04:53.936 --> 04:55.369
- It's nutmeg.
- Ooh.

04:55.370 --> 04:57.304
Nutmeg? Oh.

05:02.643 --> 05:04.868
Uh, no. I doubled the cheese.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.324
- Oh. That's interesting.
- Oh.

05:06.325 --> 05:08.082
- Yeah, okay. Yeah, that's it.
- Yeah.

05:08.083 --> 05:09.917
- Double the cheese. Yeah.
- I like that.

05:09.918 --> 05:11.319
- Mom?
- Hmm?

05:11.320 --> 05:12.553
Salad?

05:12.554 --> 05:15.189
Pass.

05:15.190 --> 05:17.425
Yeah, Jerrod, quit Maxine-ing my dinner!

05:17.426 --> 05:19.060
- Oh!
- Did I use it right?

05:19.061 --> 05:20.795
You got him good, girl.

05:20.796 --> 05:23.798
Yeah!

05:23.799 --> 05:24.999
Well, that looks like rabbit food.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.134
Nuh-uh.

05:26.135 --> 05:28.802
I fed my rabbit steak. He was a champion.

05:31.105 --> 05:32.640
You guys got to eat vegetables,

05:32.641 --> 05:35.109
and I feel like I
shouldn't have to say that.

05:35.110 --> 05:36.644
I do eat vegetables.

05:36.645 --> 05:40.448
I had jalapeño poppers
before I came over here.

05:40.449 --> 05:41.916
All right.

05:41.917 --> 05:45.219
Well, I hate to do this to
you, Mom, but if I cooked it

05:45.220 --> 05:48.922
and it's on the table, you're gonna eat it.

05:49.690 --> 05:51.425
Okay, fine!

05:51.426 --> 05:53.628
I'll eat your durn rabbit food.

05:53.629 --> 05:55.263
Thank you very much. Get some kale.

05:55.264 --> 05:57.932
You get some kale, and you get some kale.

05:57.933 --> 06:00.333
And you get some kale.

06:01.068 --> 06:03.070
Oh! Oh!

06:03.071 --> 06:04.772
It's nasty! It's just...

06:04.773 --> 06:06.741
It's nasty!

06:06.742 --> 06:08.709
It's not nasty.

06:08.710 --> 06:10.311
Joe, are you okay?

06:10.312 --> 06:12.613
Oh, Lord, he's rejecting the kale!

06:12.614 --> 06:15.283
He's grabbing his heart attack area!

06:15.284 --> 06:16.584
- Wait a minute.
- Come on now. Hold on.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.519
- It's just a little indigestion.
- Is this for real?

06:18.520 --> 06:19.854
Smile so we can see if
you're having a stroke.

06:19.855 --> 06:21.989
Why am I gonna smile
if I'm having a stroke?!

06:21.990 --> 06:23.157
Somebody get me some Pepto!

06:23.158 --> 06:24.825
- All right.
- No, no, no, no, don't get Pepto.

06:24.826 --> 06:26.594
- This may really be a heart attack.
- A heart attack?

06:26.595 --> 06:28.362
- I'm calling 911.
- Hey, use Dad's phone.

06:28.363 --> 06:30.563
- He's got free nights and weekends. 
- Nuh-uh!

06:30.632 --> 06:32.733
The ambulance co-pay is $300.

06:32.734 --> 06:33.801
I'll give you the $300.

06:33.802 --> 06:36.002
- Oh, now you're better than me?
- No, I'm calling.

06:39.208 --> 06:41.242
Do y'all hear that beep?

06:41.243 --> 06:42.810
No. I mean, listen to it.

06:42.811 --> 06:44.712
Yeah, that beep got a beat.

06:44.713 --> 06:46.547
Uh-uh. Now I got to spit now.

06:46.548 --> 06:48.182
I know y'all ain't ready for this.

06:48.183 --> 06:49.550
- You ready, Daddy?
- Oh.

06:49.551 --> 06:50.952
♪ I said my daddy about to die. ♪

06:50.953 --> 06:52.954
Oh, will you stop freestyling over Dad!

06:52.955 --> 06:55.089
The doctor said he'll be in soon,

06:55.090 --> 06:58.793
and he said to quit asking
him how soon it'll be.

06:58.794 --> 07:00.294
But it's fine.

07:00.295 --> 07:04.565
It's fine because I got
my God on speed dial.

07:04.566 --> 07:06.334
Maybe I shouldn't have doubled the cheese.

07:06.335 --> 07:09.437
No, that's the only thing
that made sense tonight.

07:09.438 --> 07:11.172
Really?

07:11.173 --> 07:13.574
Made sense, Dad? Look,
your arteries are clogged,

07:13.575 --> 07:15.176
your blood pressure's sky high,

07:15.177 --> 07:17.878
you had this triple bypass
surgery a couple years ago...

07:17.879 --> 07:19.480
Yeah, and that hit the reset button.

07:19.481 --> 07:22.116
Now it took me damn near 60
years to clog these arteries.

07:22.117 --> 07:25.219
So now I feel like I got another
60 before they're full again.

07:25.220 --> 07:26.621
I am starving to death.

07:26.622 --> 07:28.723
Somebody go over to the vending machines

07:28.724 --> 07:30.124
and get me some potato chips.

07:30.125 --> 07:31.792
Yeah, I'll go... I'll
go get 'em for you, Joe.

07:31.793 --> 07:33.628
Thank you, darling.

07:33.629 --> 07:35.563
Seriously?

07:35.564 --> 07:37.932
He called me "darling."

07:37.933 --> 07:39.533
- Look, Dad...
- All right, gather round.

07:43.437 --> 07:45.339
I got something I want to say.

07:45.340 --> 07:46.874
Oh, no.

07:46.875 --> 07:49.510
Now we got to talk about
the future of this family.

07:49.511 --> 07:51.245
After I go and your mama goes,

07:51.246 --> 07:54.315
somebody has got to step up
and take over this family.

07:54.316 --> 07:56.684
Will it be you, the chubby brave one?

07:56.685 --> 07:58.286
Or you,

07:58.287 --> 08:00.454
the skinny one who forgot
where he comes from?

08:00.455 --> 08:02.758
Wait a minute. No. I watch TV.

08:02.759 --> 08:05.660
Dad is trying to Empire us!

08:05.661 --> 08:07.261
Here you go.

08:07.262 --> 08:09.263
Or maybe I'll leave it
all to you, Maxine...

08:09.264 --> 08:11.598
the rising star.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.668
Plain chips?

08:13.669 --> 08:14.602
You want flavor?

08:14.603 --> 08:15.670
You know I want flavor.

08:15.671 --> 08:17.070
Okay.

08:17.838 --> 08:19.040
Now, boys,

08:19.041 --> 08:21.375
after I go, you got to
look after your mama.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.444
Now, I'm assuming that you're
not gonna get remarried,

08:23.445 --> 08:24.979
right, honey?

08:24.980 --> 08:28.416
Well, yeah, eventually.

08:28.417 --> 08:30.151
It gets lonely out there.

08:30.152 --> 08:31.585
Yeah, well, it better not be

08:31.586 --> 08:33.120
to that Lawrence from down the street.

08:33.121 --> 08:35.856
- Oh, Lawrence.
- Wait, wait, wait.

08:35.857 --> 08:37.658
Who's-who's Lawrence from down the street?

08:37.659 --> 08:39.360
You know Lawrence. He bowlegged.

08:39.361 --> 08:40.660
Lawrence, man, damn.

08:40.662 --> 08:41.962
From down the street?

08:41.962 --> 08:43.264
From down the street. Yeah.

08:43.265 --> 08:44.932
- Oh, doctor's here.
- Hello.

08:44.933 --> 08:46.267
- How are you feeling?
- Look, now, Doc,

08:46.268 --> 08:48.169
don't feel the need to
sugarcoat anything, all right?

08:48.170 --> 08:49.370
Just give it to him straight.

08:49.371 --> 08:50.938
He knows that he had a heart attack,

08:50.939 --> 08:53.074
so just tell him how
bad it was. Like a 4.5?

08:53.075 --> 08:55.009
Uh, Mr. Carmichael, you
did not have a heart attack.

08:55.010 --> 08:57.211
- Told you!
- Thank goodness.

08:57.212 --> 08:58.913
Check the chart again.
I mean, look at the man.

08:58.914 --> 09:00.614
He's got lumps all over his body.

09:00.615 --> 09:04.485
Why are you looking at
your daddy's lumpy body?

09:04.486 --> 09:06.620
Mr. Carmichael, can you tell me
a little bit about your night?

09:06.621 --> 09:08.589
I mean, what led up to
the pain in your chest?

09:08.590 --> 09:10.591
That one made me try kale.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.259
Oh, it was nasty.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.661
It was just nasty.

09:13.662 --> 09:17.832
Felt like Christmas tree in my mouth.

09:17.833 --> 09:20.368
I see here you had a bypass in 2013?

09:20.369 --> 09:22.937
- No, Doc. Not a bypass. A triple.
- Ah.

09:22.938 --> 09:24.772
- Triple crown.
- Triple crown.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.540
- American Pharaoh.
- Yes.

09:26.541 --> 09:28.409
Well, we did find some new blockage,

09:28.410 --> 09:29.844
and that is concerning.

09:29.845 --> 09:32.546
See? Concerning, Dad. He said "concerning."

09:32.547 --> 09:34.415
Doctor, what are you trying to say?

09:34.416 --> 09:35.850
I recommend we get ahead of this

09:35.851 --> 09:37.318
to avoid another bypass in the future.

09:37.319 --> 09:39.220
One good option is to put in a stent.

09:39.221 --> 09:40.421
It's an outpatient procedure.

09:40.422 --> 09:41.756
You'll be on your feet the next day.

09:41.757 --> 09:43.357
Now, how soon can we do this?

09:43.358 --> 09:45.292
No, you said "option."
What's the other option?

09:45.293 --> 09:46.827
Well, we don't put in the stent,

09:46.828 --> 09:48.763
and you run the risk of
doing even more damage.

09:48.764 --> 09:49.930
I'll take that one.

09:49.931 --> 09:51.732
That sounds like a lot
less work for both of us.

09:51.733 --> 09:53.634
What?! Are you kidding me?

09:53.635 --> 09:54.635
Barbecue?

09:54.636 --> 09:56.103
Barbecue!

09:56.104 --> 09:57.972
All right.

10:02.256 --> 10:05.231
Oh, thank God everything is fine.

10:05.232 --> 10:07.400
Yup, clean bill of health.

10:07.401 --> 10:09.219
We're calling a partially blocked artery

10:09.220 --> 10:11.487
a clean bill of health now?

10:11.488 --> 10:13.555
You choose to see my
artery as half blocked,

10:13.556 --> 10:15.657
while I choose to see it as half open.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.659
It's all in your perspective, son.

10:17.660 --> 10:19.328
Now, what's for dessert?

10:19.329 --> 10:22.264
Oh, I can make you
some, uh, banana pudding.

10:22.265 --> 10:24.133
Wait. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa. Well, now,

10:24.134 --> 10:26.135
20 minutes ago, a doctor told this man

10:26.136 --> 10:28.403
he needs to have procedure
to unclog an artery,

10:28.404 --> 10:30.139
and now you want to make him some pudding?

10:30.140 --> 10:31.406
Hey, hey, hey, man,

10:31.407 --> 10:34.376
pudding can slide through
a tiny hole, brother.

10:34.377 --> 10:36.145
Why is everybody cool
with him not having it?

10:36.146 --> 10:37.446
Ma, will you talk to him?

10:37.447 --> 10:40.182
Jerrod, your daddy is his own man.

10:40.183 --> 10:42.451
I will not tell him
what to do with his body,

10:42.452 --> 10:46.321
'cause I sure don't want him
to tell me what to do with mine.

10:46.322 --> 10:48.323
W... What about you, Bobby?

10:48.324 --> 10:50.765
Like, are you cool with
Dad not having the surgery?

10:50.766 --> 10:54.163
Yeah, I... Look, I don't want
to see Dad go through that again.

10:54.164 --> 10:56.431
And that bypass was just way too much.

10:56.432 --> 10:58.400
To be honest with you, you know,

10:58.401 --> 11:00.234
I'd just rather he die.

11:12.181 --> 11:14.750
Thank you, son.

11:14.751 --> 11:17.451
Why can't you be more like your brother?

11:20.556 --> 11:22.524
Jerrod.

11:22.525 --> 11:25.227
What are you doing?
It's 3:00 in the morning.

11:25.228 --> 11:27.529
I'm eating waffles. It's...

11:27.530 --> 11:29.264
it's my stress food.

11:29.265 --> 11:33.769
It makes me feel like I'm in a
log cabin and everything's okay.

11:33.770 --> 11:36.605
Aw, I'm sorry.

11:36.606 --> 11:38.073
I know that you're frustrated that your dad

11:38.074 --> 11:40.943
- won't go through with the procedure.
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:40.944 --> 11:43.145
Do you feel like talking about it now?

11:43.146 --> 11:45.681
Wait a minute, I know what you're doing.

11:45.682 --> 11:47.249
You're trying to therapist me, aren't you?

11:47.250 --> 11:48.684
I told you about that.

11:48.685 --> 11:50.319
I told you. I don't want
you to therapist me, Maxine.

11:50.320 --> 11:52.588
- I'm not into that.
- O-Okay. Then I'll...

11:52.589 --> 11:54.556
then I'll just sit here
and watch TV with you.

11:54.557 --> 11:57.825
Thank you.

12:02.232 --> 12:06.168
See, the problem with my father is, like...

12:06.169 --> 12:09.104
- if he's not gonna get the stent, right...
- Mm-hmm.

12:09.105 --> 12:11.073
If he's not gonna get the
stent, the least he could do

12:11.074 --> 12:13.742
is eat healthy, but, like,
the problem is he grew up poor,

12:13.743 --> 12:16.545
and nobody shows poor people
how to eat healthy, you know?

12:16.546 --> 12:18.413
- You know what his favorite holiday is?
- Hmm?

12:18.414 --> 12:21.383
Free Pancake Day at IHOP.

12:21.384 --> 12:23.218
Well, what's wrong with Free Pancake Day?

12:23.219 --> 12:24.887
Everybody loves free pancakes.

12:24.888 --> 12:27.322
It's IHOP's way of giving
back to the community.

12:27.323 --> 12:30.259
What? No, it's not giving back
if the gift is diabetes, Maxine.

12:30.260 --> 12:32.728
Okay? You ever notice

12:32.729 --> 12:34.162
that it's only, like, the worst food

12:34.163 --> 12:36.064
that they give away for
free? Like, you never hear

12:36.065 --> 12:38.533
about Whole Foods having,
like, Free Apple Day.

12:38.534 --> 12:41.169
You know? That's how they
keep people down. They give 'em

12:41.170 --> 12:44.907
high blood pressure and,
like, diabetes and gout.

12:44.908 --> 12:46.842
'Cause you can't run for president

12:46.843 --> 12:49.678
if you ain't got no legs, Maxine.

12:49.679 --> 12:52.281
All right, I'm hearing your frustration,

12:52.282 --> 12:55.050
and I think that you're
taking out some anger on IHOP.

12:55.051 --> 12:56.685
My dad's in denial. I mean, it's like...

12:56.686 --> 12:58.787
if he's not gonna get the
stent, he needs to eat healthy.

12:58.788 --> 13:01.256
He needs to exercise, you know?

13:01.257 --> 13:03.225
Look, if you really want to help your dad,

13:03.226 --> 13:05.627
you've got to tell him
what he means to you,

13:05.628 --> 13:07.062
why you don't want to lose him.

13:07.063 --> 13:08.430
You know, appeal to his emotions.

13:08.431 --> 13:11.266
Show him that you're coming
from a place of-of caring

13:11.267 --> 13:13.502
and that you love him.

13:13.503 --> 13:15.671
Just accept him for who he is and...

13:15.672 --> 13:18.640
enjoy the time that you have with him now.

13:18.641 --> 13:21.343
So, uh, just give up on my father.

13:21.344 --> 13:23.145
That's your advice? Give up on my father?

13:23.146 --> 13:24.980
You know what, Maxine, I'm
gonna come up with a better idea,

13:24.981 --> 13:27.301
and, when I do, don't you try
and take credit for it, okay?

13:30.385 --> 13:31.987
And, you know what, Maxine,

13:31.988 --> 13:34.957
if you really believe that
love can change people, then...

13:34.958 --> 13:37.525
you should know I love you.

13:39.528 --> 13:42.229
And I really think you
need to change your major.

13:43.932 --> 13:47.736
♪ Jacob's ladder... ♪

13:47.737 --> 13:49.705
♪ Soldier... ♪

13:49.706 --> 13:53.307
Hey, Ma. You in here singing slave songs?

13:55.010 --> 13:57.646
I guess.

13:57.647 --> 13:59.014
What you got over there?

13:59.015 --> 14:01.016
All right, so last night
Maxine and I were talking,

14:01.017 --> 14:03.885
- right, and then I figured
it out all on my own. - Uh-huh.

14:03.886 --> 14:06.321
- Oh.
- So, everything that Dad eats

14:06.322 --> 14:08.023
- comes through you.
- Uh-huh.

14:08.024 --> 14:09.591
Meaning we needed to come bring you

14:09.592 --> 14:10.859
some healthier options, you know?

14:10.860 --> 14:13.060
Okay.

14:16.531 --> 14:19.267
Okay, Ma, what are you doing?

14:19.268 --> 14:21.370
I'm making your daddy some banana pudding.

14:21.371 --> 14:23.138
He changed his mind last night,

14:23.139 --> 14:25.706
so I made him some caramel corn.

14:26.475 --> 14:29.111
Caramel corn? Banana pudding?

14:29.112 --> 14:31.213
What is this, a-a... just
a bucket of butter, Ma?

14:31.214 --> 14:33.915
It's like Paula Deen's kitchen in here.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.418
You know, I feel sad for her.

14:36.419 --> 14:38.220
You have one outburst,

14:38.221 --> 14:41.055
and everybody forgets how
good your biscuits are!

14:43.258 --> 14:44.559
All right, well, look,
Maxine, you get the fridge,

14:44.560 --> 14:46.561
- I'll get the cabinets, all right?
- Yep.

14:46.562 --> 14:48.130
Uh-uh, uh-uh! Don't be
messing up my kitchen.

14:48.131 --> 14:49.698
You don't see me coming in your house,

14:49.699 --> 14:51.433
switching things around,

14:51.434 --> 14:54.336
like repainting the walls or
putting out your girlfriend.

14:54.337 --> 14:56.171
Um,

14:56.172 --> 14:58.440
I-I meant that in general, Maxine.

14:58.441 --> 14:59.408
Of course.

14:59.409 --> 15:01.475
Otherwise it'd be cruel.

15:06.648 --> 15:07.983
Hey, Maxine, while you're here,

15:07.984 --> 15:09.451
throw some fruit in there, all right?

15:09.452 --> 15:12.821
Jerrod, you know your daddy
don't like fruit like that.

15:12.822 --> 15:14.556
Then how are you even
making banana pudding?

15:14.557 --> 15:15.857
I don't use bananas.

15:15.858 --> 15:18.160
- Baby, get me that yellow
dye at the cabinet. - No.

15:18.161 --> 15:20.328
No, no. No, no, no, no, no.

15:20.329 --> 15:21.763
What are... Ma,

15:21.764 --> 15:23.598
you got to eat real food.

15:23.599 --> 15:26.368
You know, growing up, I drank
more Kool-Aid than water?

15:26.369 --> 15:29.471
And you were happy. Don't you forget that.

15:29.472 --> 15:30.906
You can't keep making excuses for him.

15:30.907 --> 15:32.107
If he keeps eating like this,

15:32.108 --> 15:33.375
he's gonna end up back in the hospital.

15:33.376 --> 15:35.677
Jerrod, I cook the way I cook.

15:35.678 --> 15:37.245
Now, there is a reason

15:37.246 --> 15:39.815
why broccoli recipes are not passed down

15:39.816 --> 15:42.451
from generation to generation.

15:42.452 --> 15:43.885
You know what? And I thought about that.

15:43.886 --> 15:46.221
That's why I got you this.
I got you a cookbook, Ma.

15:46.222 --> 15:49.124
- Healthy recipes in here, okay?
- Oh, no, Jerrod, you know I fry everything.

15:49.125 --> 15:52.094
- I know you fry everything. I know you do.
- I don't know how to do...

15:52.095 --> 15:54.062
- And that's why I got you this, too. Look.
- Tofu?

15:54.063 --> 15:55.964
It's a... it's a steamer, all right?

15:55.965 --> 15:58.300
You don't add any grease
or oil, just water.

15:58.301 --> 16:00.467
Now, slow down! I'm not a scientist!

16:03.872 --> 16:05.841
All right.

16:05.842 --> 16:07.809
Listen to me, Ma, before you go telling me

16:07.810 --> 16:09.644
that healthy food is
too expensive to buy...

16:09.645 --> 16:11.680
- Yeah, that's what I was gonna say.
- I figured you were

16:11.681 --> 16:13.682
gonna say something like
that. I got you this.

16:13.683 --> 16:15.083
What is this?

16:15.084 --> 16:17.352
- It's a gift card to Whole Foods, okay?
- Whole...

16:17.353 --> 16:19.121
Now we don't have any more excuses.

16:19.122 --> 16:20.589
We can't just keep
pretending nothing's wrong,

16:20.590 --> 16:22.958
all right? Dad needs healthier options.

16:22.959 --> 16:24.593
So it's enough money on there
for you to buy the groceries

16:24.594 --> 16:25.660
for a couple weeks.

16:25.661 --> 16:27.629
A couple of weeks, huh?

16:27.630 --> 16:29.397
All right.

16:29.398 --> 16:33.335
I'll go to your fancy grocery store.

16:33.336 --> 16:35.137
Thank you. Thanks.

16:35.138 --> 16:38.273
Well, tell me this, do I have
to dress up to go in there?

16:38.274 --> 16:40.842
Or should I wear my hat?

16:40.843 --> 16:42.077
You know I got a nice hat.

16:42.078 --> 16:44.212
You know what, I'm gonna get my hat.

16:44.213 --> 16:46.648
Joe! Where's my hat?!

16:46.649 --> 16:49.618
Get this thing in here.
All right, be careful.

16:49.619 --> 16:52.587
All right. All right.

16:52.588 --> 16:55.323
- Okay.
- Right here's cool.

16:55.324 --> 16:58.525
Daddy got a swing!

17:01.129 --> 17:03.431
Wait a minute. Wait, what the hell?

17:03.432 --> 17:07.736
Dad, why is there a swing in
the middle of the living room?

17:07.737 --> 17:09.171
It's not a swing.

17:09.172 --> 17:13.773
It is an organic, fair trade,
non-pasteurized hemp hammock.

17:16.344 --> 17:17.979
I bought it with your gift card.

17:17.980 --> 17:19.580
Cost me $200.

17:19.582 --> 17:22.316
Which, by the way, you owe me $53.

17:24.386 --> 17:26.788
You weren't planning on bringing
that thing in here, were you?

17:26.789 --> 17:29.457
I can't have no treadmill
in my living room.

17:29.458 --> 17:30.525
That-That's crazy.

17:30.526 --> 17:31.860
Hey, kids.

17:31.861 --> 17:34.329
Ma, you were supposed to buy
healthy food with that money.

17:34.330 --> 17:36.097
I took your father to the store with me.

17:36.098 --> 17:39.367
You know how he is when
he sees something he likes.

17:39.368 --> 17:42.204
I thought you said you
wanted me to make him happier.

17:42.205 --> 17:44.372
No, I said I wanted you
to make him healthier.

17:44.373 --> 17:46.840
Well, that was not clear.

17:47.876 --> 17:50.078
All right, you know what,
Dad, get up, all right?

17:50.079 --> 17:52.847
Get up. Get out, all right?
I'm taking this back. You-you...

17:52.848 --> 17:54.883
you are really, really
selfish, you know that?

17:54.884 --> 17:56.518
You really just want us all to sit around

17:56.519 --> 17:57.886
and watch you kill yourself.

17:57.887 --> 17:59.054
What? I'm not trying to kill myself.

17:59.055 --> 18:00.722
This is a stress reliever.

18:00.723 --> 18:04.226
I'm more relaxed than the
sleeping hippie on the box!

18:04.227 --> 18:06.995
Here. You know what,

18:06.996 --> 18:09.664
you won't exercise, you won't get
the stent, you won't eat healthy.

18:09.665 --> 18:12.133
That is asking your family
to watch you kill yourself.

18:12.134 --> 18:13.468
Well, what about what
you're asking me to do?

18:13.469 --> 18:15.337
That is a dangerous procedure.

18:15.338 --> 18:17.372
- What I'm telling you you need to do is
that you need to... - No, I don't need you

18:17.373 --> 18:20.642
to tell me anything. I'm the
one that has to lie on the table,

18:20.643 --> 18:23.311
get knocked out, and have
his chest cracked open.

18:23.312 --> 18:25.213
Does that sound like fun?
Well, I will tell you.

18:25.214 --> 18:28.183
It is not. 'Cause I had
to do the same damn thing

18:28.184 --> 18:30.352
for that bypass. And it made me realize

18:30.353 --> 18:32.487
that my life could be over in an instant.

18:32.488 --> 18:34.623
And I promised myself, moving forward,

18:34.624 --> 18:36.424
I'm gonna do things that make me happy.

18:36.425 --> 18:39.261
And that surgery doesn't make me happy.

18:39.262 --> 18:41.596
Well, I'm telling you you
learned the wrong lesson.

18:41.597 --> 18:43.999
The lesson you were supposed
to learn was to appreciate life.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.433
The lesson you were supposed to learn

18:45.434 --> 18:47.435
was to appreciate your
family. I mean, don't you want

18:47.436 --> 18:49.437
to stick around in case you have grandkids?

18:49.438 --> 18:50.905
That's hypothetical, Maxine.

18:50.906 --> 18:53.074
Don't you dare...

18:53.075 --> 18:55.910
don't you dare pawn them kids off on me.

18:55.911 --> 18:57.946
I already raised you, and
I'm gonna be honest with you,

18:57.947 --> 19:00.881
I did not enjoy it.

19:01.650 --> 19:03.685
So that's it, huh?

19:03.686 --> 19:05.654
You're just gonna sit around and die, huh?

19:05.655 --> 19:08.156
No, I'm gonna sit around and live.

19:08.157 --> 19:11.059
Why are you so worried
about when I'm gonna die?

19:11.060 --> 19:12.861
Because you're my father! Maybe...

19:12.862 --> 19:15.762
maybe I'm not done with you yet.

19:19.601 --> 19:21.569
All right.

19:21.570 --> 19:23.238
I get it.

19:23.239 --> 19:25.774
You need me.

19:25.775 --> 19:27.776
So, um...

19:27.777 --> 19:30.445
maybe I'll get that stent.

19:30.446 --> 19:31.713
You will?

19:31.714 --> 19:33.515
Well, I mean, if my son
is standing here telling me

19:33.516 --> 19:35.550
that he will be completely
lost without me...

19:35.551 --> 19:37.552
- That is not what I said.
- You said your life

19:37.553 --> 19:39.688
- is gonna be in shambles if I
happen to die. - I did not...

19:39.689 --> 19:40.789
I did not say that either.

19:40.790 --> 19:42.023
Come on, boy. Come in here now.

19:42.024 --> 19:43.358
Come on, come on now.

19:43.359 --> 19:46.361
- All right. All right.
- Ah.

19:46.362 --> 19:48.629
All right.

19:51.900 --> 19:53.735
I told you to use your emotions.

19:53.736 --> 19:55.670
This is... this is all me.

19:55.671 --> 19:57.605
- No, no, no, no. I'm sorry, Dad. No, no.
- I told him to use his emotions.

19:57.606 --> 19:58.807
I will not let you have this one.

19:58.808 --> 20:00.975
She Maxined the whole moment!

20:06.684 --> 20:11.157
Okay. Who wants Daddy's
Home from the Hospital Cake?

20:11.158 --> 20:12.203
Ma...

20:12.204 --> 20:14.460
And before you start, Jerrod, it's low fat.

20:16.296 --> 20:17.930
I see that.

20:17.931 --> 20:20.800
Give your daddy a break.

20:20.801 --> 20:22.502
He just escaped

20:22.503 --> 20:23.603
death

20:23.604 --> 20:25.438
for the second time.

20:25.439 --> 20:26.919
I was lying on that table,

20:26.920 --> 20:29.589
and I don't know what
happened but I left my body.

20:29.590 --> 20:31.457
Then the next thing I know,

20:31.458 --> 20:33.392
I'm staring down on myself,

20:33.393 --> 20:37.396
and I turn around and all I
can see is vast nothingness.

20:37.397 --> 20:40.066
It's like I could see
everything but nothing.

20:40.067 --> 20:42.769
And I think, "Man, this must
be what peace looks like."

20:42.770 --> 20:46.973
And then I-I... Who you waving at?

20:46.974 --> 20:49.809
Lawrence from down the street.

20:49.810 --> 20:52.779
Lawrence from down the street?

20:52.780 --> 20:57.216
Lawrence, you better get
your ass back down the street!

20:58.986 --> 21:02.789
Well, I got your daddy to exercise.

21:02.790 --> 21:08.748
