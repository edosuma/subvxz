WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:07.882
You're just another Scavenger,

00:07.966 --> 00:10.176
like the rest of them.

00:15.515 --> 00:17.100
<i>Can I open my eyes now?</i>

00:17.183 --> 00:19.561
No, Sonic, not yet.

00:19.644 --> 00:23.189
Amy, you better not be tricking
me into the water again.

00:23.273 --> 00:27.026
No trick, Sonic.
Trust me. You're gonna love it.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.154
Okay, open them!

00:29.904 --> 00:30.947
Ta-da!

00:32.323 --> 00:35.326
You got me... the Palm Tree?

00:35.744 --> 00:36.828
So it is a trick.

00:36.911 --> 00:39.247
No, Sonic, it's not a trick.

00:39.330 --> 00:41.624
But I already have a palm tree.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.793
That one. And that one.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.003
And those over there.

00:45.086 --> 00:47.213
The gift isn't just the tree.

00:47.297 --> 00:50.467
It's all the memories
we've made around that tree.

00:50.550 --> 00:53.386
Like that time when you bet me
I couldn't fly up to the top

00:53.470 --> 00:54.888
by the time you
ran home and back.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.557
You still owe me, by the way.

00:57.640 --> 00:59.350
And the time we worked together

00:59.434 --> 01:01.352
to make Amy
that coconut cream pie.

01:01.436 --> 01:04.147
Or when I saw you
buy a coconut cream pie

01:04.230 --> 01:05.982
and tell Amy you made it.

01:08.193 --> 01:10.737
Or that time I laughed so hard,

01:10.820 --> 01:12.822
chili shot out my nose.

01:12.906 --> 01:15.158
I still can't smell.

01:17.285 --> 01:20.038
Yeah, really good times.

01:20.121 --> 01:21.414
Right, Sonic?

01:21.498 --> 01:23.374
Come on, guys, don't you think

01:23.458 --> 01:25.460
you're all being a little too...

01:25.543 --> 01:27.295
I don't know...

01:27.378 --> 01:29.005
sentimental?

01:29.088 --> 01:30.632
Look, I get it.

01:30.715 --> 01:33.968
Tree. Friendship. Memories.

01:34.052 --> 01:35.929
Chili dogs!

01:37.931 --> 01:40.683
I guess you don't get it,
do you, Sonic?

01:52.153 --> 01:54.322
Ahh!

01:55.865 --> 01:57.492
Yahh!

02:01.496 --> 02:06.251
Yes! The power to regenerate
the jungle in a single strike.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.461
Hi-yahh!

02:09.838 --> 02:11.089
Ahh!

02:11.172 --> 02:14.300
Oh! I could get used to this!

02:22.267 --> 02:24.519
Finally, I can shut them out.

02:24.602 --> 02:26.062
All of them.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.648
They'll never harm
the jungle again.

02:29.315 --> 02:31.025
Uh, what was that now?

02:31.109 --> 02:33.319
Let's see what
this hammer can do!

02:33.403 --> 02:34.529
Yahh!

02:46.624 --> 02:47.625
Not good.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.512
Thorn, wait!

02:59.596 --> 03:01.556
How many times
do I have to tell you?

03:01.639 --> 03:03.892
I'm not your enemy!

03:03.975 --> 03:06.019
Come on, Thorn,
you gotta trust me!

03:06.102 --> 03:08.563
Hand over
the pretty crystal thingy.

03:08.646 --> 03:09.856
Please?

03:11.691 --> 03:13.735
You're a fool
if you think I'd give you

03:13.818 --> 03:16.571
the heart of the jungle
when I'm so close.

03:16.654 --> 03:19.365
Whoa, whoa, whoa! So close to what?
Where are you going?

03:19.449 --> 03:23.369
To do what I must
to protect the Green forever.

03:24.537 --> 03:25.955
"Protect the Green"?

03:26.039 --> 03:27.582
The Scavengers!

03:30.877 --> 03:32.545
Sorry, Thorny,
I don't want to hurt you,

03:32.629 --> 03:34.714
but I won't let you
hurt anyone else.

03:34.797 --> 03:37.091
Ha! Then you
don't have a choice.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.303
Hi-yahh!

03:43.848 --> 03:46.893
Get in my way again,
and I won't be so forgiving.

03:50.605 --> 03:52.232
Thorn! Wait!

03:54.067 --> 03:56.236
Thorn!

03:58.321 --> 04:00.031
Okay.

04:00.114 --> 04:02.200
Maybe it's not so bad.

04:02.283 --> 04:04.994
The Scavengers
have dealt with her before.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.913
They'll be fine!

04:06.996 --> 04:09.666
It's not like they're just
sitting around eating bark.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.795
-Mmm. It's good bark.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.630
I gotta get outta here!

04:17.548 --> 04:20.301
There's no roof! Of course!

04:20.385 --> 04:21.928
Wow, I really should have
thought of that sooner.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.189
-Hey, how's it going?

04:40.363 --> 04:41.614
I'm free!

04:41.698 --> 04:43.032
Gotta go fast!

04:47.078 --> 04:49.372
â™ª

05:01.926 --> 05:02.927
You again.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.220
Yep, me again.

05:05.888 --> 05:07.473
Look, I don't want to hurt you!

05:07.557 --> 05:09.267
But I'm taking that hammer!

05:09.350 --> 05:11.978
The only thing you're
going to take is a beating!

05:15.148 --> 05:16.232
Whoa.

05:28.911 --> 05:30.288
Wow, that's
some grip you have.

05:30.371 --> 05:33.499
Have you-- Ahhh!

05:33.583 --> 05:36.169
I could do this all day!

05:36.252 --> 05:37.462
Hi-yahh!

05:37.545 --> 05:38.838
Whoaa!

05:40.715 --> 05:42.550
Yay! Oh!

05:42.633 --> 05:43.926
-Ow!

05:44.010 --> 05:45.136
Easy!

05:46.220 --> 05:47.430
Whoa!

05:49.265 --> 05:50.308
Whoa!

05:52.643 --> 05:54.062
Ha ha!

05:54.145 --> 05:55.730
Whoo!

05:55.813 --> 05:58.024
-Whaa! Hey!

05:58.107 --> 06:00.651
-Whoa!
-Hi-yahh!

06:00.735 --> 06:03.071
Ahh!

06:03.154 --> 06:05.823
It'll take more than getting
a few splinters to stop me.

06:13.748 --> 06:14.707
Hey!

06:22.006 --> 06:23.508
Yahh!

06:28.679 --> 06:29.639
Huh?

06:33.643 --> 06:34.769
See? I told you.

06:34.852 --> 06:36.771
It's the trees coming to get us.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.818
-Whoa!

07:03.214 --> 07:04.507
Ow!

07:13.391 --> 07:14.642
No, no, no, no, no, no!

07:18.479 --> 07:20.440
Whoa!

07:20.523 --> 07:23.025
Whoa!

07:28.906 --> 07:32.034
Well, look what
the cat dragged in.

07:32.118 --> 07:34.787
I did not.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.415
It's an expression.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.417
What are you doing here?

07:39.500 --> 07:41.252
The last time we saw you,

07:41.335 --> 07:44.172
you were with the monster,
betraying us.

07:44.255 --> 07:45.798
You got it backwards, bud.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.175
I didn't betray you.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.718
I went to get the Shard,

07:48.801 --> 07:50.761
the thing you were
supposed to help me get?

07:50.845 --> 07:53.222
So... you're not after our bark?

07:53.306 --> 07:54.515
No one wants your bark!

07:54.599 --> 07:55.975
What's your point?

07:56.058 --> 07:58.186
My point is,
she's on her way here!

07:58.269 --> 08:00.813
Whatever your beef is,
you gotta squash it, pronto!

08:00.897 --> 08:03.107
What's all this about beef?

08:03.191 --> 08:07.320
What I'm saying is, you need
to find some common ground!

08:07.403 --> 08:10.364
"Common ground"?!
We live in the trees!

08:10.448 --> 08:12.158
This guy's paranoid.

08:12.241 --> 08:13.493
Are you kidding me?!

08:13.576 --> 08:15.161
You don't understand.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.954
There is no common ground.

08:17.038 --> 08:19.290
Not anymore.

08:24.003 --> 08:26.589
<i>We used to be... friends.</i>

08:26.672 --> 08:28.716
<i>Now I can barely</i>
<i>remember a time</i>

08:28.799 --> 08:31.010
<i>when we all got along.</i>

08:31.093 --> 08:33.763
<i>Sharing the spoils</i>
<i>of the jungle.</i>

08:33.846 --> 08:36.390
<i>Taking only</i>
<i>what we needed to survive.</i>

08:45.316 --> 08:46.275
<i>Then, one day...</i>

08:49.654 --> 08:51.072
Ahhh!

08:51.155 --> 08:52.949
<i>...she chose</i>
<i>the jungle over us,</i>

08:53.032 --> 08:56.452
<i>chasing us up into the canopy,</i>
<i>where we've been ever since.</i>

08:57.995 --> 09:01.499
You can't find
common ground with a monster.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.087
I can't believe that.

09:06.170 --> 09:08.464
Amy has to be in there.

09:08.548 --> 09:10.091
Somewhere.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.801
Listen.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.220
You have to
make peace with Thorn.

09:18.933 --> 09:20.768
No. We're done with her.

09:20.851 --> 09:23.729
Look, we talk to her as friends

09:23.813 --> 09:26.732
and we try to get her
to listen to reason. Right?

09:26.816 --> 09:28.526
Yeah? Are you with me?

09:31.362 --> 09:32.238
-Uh...

09:36.534 --> 09:38.369
Uh, you should have
listened to me!

09:39.912 --> 09:41.247
Ahh!

09:44.709 --> 09:46.377
Let's go, you two!

09:46.460 --> 09:48.629
Do we have a choice?

09:49.839 --> 09:51.340
-Nope.
-Finally!

09:51.424 --> 09:53.009
Okay, here's the plan.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.011
We go in gently--

10:01.100 --> 10:02.935
Attack!

10:06.606 --> 10:09.483
Maybe follow my lead this time?

10:09.567 --> 10:12.236
-I vote yes.
-Yes.

10:12.320 --> 10:14.614
All right! Follow me!

10:26.375 --> 10:28.210
It's dark.

10:28.294 --> 10:30.254
Too dark.

10:30.338 --> 10:33.090
Or... she's making us
think it's too dark!

10:33.174 --> 10:36.385
Yeah, no, it's definitely dark.

10:40.723 --> 10:42.308
Well, well, well...

10:42.391 --> 10:45.311
look what
the hedgehog dragged in.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.731
Okay, be cool. Act natural.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.735
Hey, Thorn.

10:52.818 --> 10:56.155
We just want to
have a friendly chit-chat.

10:56.238 --> 10:57.740
Remember those?

10:57.907 --> 11:00.868
Hi, Thorn,
I love the bird you're riding.

11:01.243 --> 11:03.996
Thanks, Prim,
Birdie is one of a kind.

11:04.080 --> 11:06.457
That's an excellent treetop
village you built.

11:06.540 --> 11:08.751
Thanks, it does the job.

11:08.834 --> 11:09.960
Why are we arguing again?

11:10.044 --> 11:12.171
I have no idea.

11:12.254 --> 11:15.633
Hugs? Huggsies!

11:16.217 --> 11:18.052
We start there, then move on

11:18.219 --> 11:21.722
to a constructive conversational
volley about our issues,

11:21.806 --> 11:23.641
minus the--

11:23.724 --> 11:25.601
Oh, I'll get you!

11:25.684 --> 11:27.603
Okay, look,
despite the last several--

11:27.686 --> 11:29.438
oh, I don't know how long--

11:29.522 --> 11:33.317
we're all really
good friends here. Yeah? Right?

11:33.401 --> 11:36.278
So let's talk this through,
come to a peaceful agreement,

11:36.362 --> 11:38.864
and who knows?
Maybe by the end of it,

11:38.948 --> 11:40.866
we'll all be laughing.

11:42.159 --> 11:43.536
What is there to talk about?

11:43.619 --> 11:45.454
See? We're talking!

11:45.538 --> 11:47.373
Now, Amy would probably say

11:47.456 --> 11:49.417
we should talk about
our feelings.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.835
Our "feelings"?

11:50.918 --> 11:52.002
"Feelings..."

11:52.086 --> 11:53.629
"Feelings..."

11:53.712 --> 11:54.839
"Feelings."

11:54.922 --> 11:57.383
<i>Feelings </i>like a trap to me.

11:57.466 --> 12:03.139
Ugh. Okay look, I'll go first.
I feel like, um...

12:03.222 --> 12:04.515
Like you don't know
what you're doing?

12:04.598 --> 12:05.724
I'm trying!

12:05.808 --> 12:08.018
I feel like this
would be easier

12:08.102 --> 12:10.729
if you didn't
interrupt me all the time!

12:10.813 --> 12:13.649
And I feel like this is
harder than it looks,

12:13.732 --> 12:15.901
even though Amy
makes it look so easy.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.361
-Now you go.
-Me?

12:17.445 --> 12:18.904
Sure. Go ahead.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.739
Remember,
there's no wrong way to feel.

12:22.158 --> 12:24.076
She's distracted! Now!

12:24.160 --> 12:25.077
-Hey!

12:25.161 --> 12:26.912
You voted to follow my lead!
Remember?

12:26.996 --> 12:30.249
I feel... angry!

12:30.332 --> 12:31.459
Yahh!

12:48.767 --> 12:50.644
Okay, I get it, you're angry.

12:50.728 --> 12:53.564
But what happened to
the not-fighting part?

12:53.647 --> 12:55.649
They've proven
they can't be trusted.

12:55.733 --> 12:58.527
And now at last, it ends!

13:08.412 --> 13:10.247
What did you do?

13:10.331 --> 13:13.167
I... I did what I had to.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.003
This should keep
the Scavengers above the canopy.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.671
Where they belong!

13:17.755 --> 13:20.508
Thorn, You destroyed their home.
They'll starve!

13:20.591 --> 13:23.969
If that's what it takes
to save the jungle...

13:24.053 --> 13:26.055
...so be it.

13:27.723 --> 13:29.058
No, no, no!

13:29.141 --> 13:31.227
Ugh, why are
none of you getting this?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.229
You need to figure out
a way to live,

13:33.312 --> 13:35.856
all of you, together!

13:35.940 --> 13:38.400
What do you know
about togetherness?

13:42.029 --> 13:43.447
Okay, open them.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.908
Ta-da!

13:45.991 --> 13:48.077
But I already have a palm tree.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.162
The gift isn't just the tree.

13:50.246 --> 13:54.166
It's all the memories
we've made around that tree.

13:54.250 --> 13:57.294
It's the tree that
binds us all together.

13:57.378 --> 13:58.963
Thorn, everything is connected--

13:59.046 --> 14:03.842
you, me, the Green,
even the Scavengers.

14:03.926 --> 14:06.679
We're all a part of something
bigger than ourselves.

14:08.305 --> 14:11.475
What a bunch of
sentimental garbage!

14:11.559 --> 14:13.352
But you told me that.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.942
No matter.
With the Heart of the Jungle,

14:20.025 --> 14:22.236
I have the power
to make sure the Green

14:22.319 --> 14:24.405
never gets hurt again.

14:24.488 --> 14:25.781
"Hurt"?

14:25.865 --> 14:27.241
I'm done with you.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.034
You're done with me?

14:29.118 --> 14:31.871
Fine! I'm going to talk
to the Great Green!

14:31.954 --> 14:34.248
You stay away
from the Great Green!

14:36.500 --> 14:37.585
Faster, Birdie!

14:37.668 --> 14:38.878
Give it all you've got.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.303
Oh, Birdie! I'm sorry!

14:47.386 --> 14:49.179
But you have to keep going.

14:49.263 --> 14:52.349
He's probably at
the Great Green by now!

14:57.313 --> 14:59.148
â™ª

14:59.231 --> 15:01.525
Ugh, not getting
much light are you?

15:03.611 --> 15:07.072
Man, it's gotten so dark,
even Thorn has lost her way.

15:07.156 --> 15:09.199
But don't worry,
I've got a plan.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.951
You're in it.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.538
I know, just trust me.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.666
Get... away.

15:17.750 --> 15:20.544
From my... tree!

15:24.506 --> 15:25.633
Make me!

15:25.716 --> 15:27.176
Birdie!

15:29.261 --> 15:31.305
Whoa?! That thing can fly?!

15:37.645 --> 15:39.647
Face it, Thorny!
You know I'm right!

15:39.730 --> 15:42.942
How dare you disrespect
the Great Green!

15:43.025 --> 15:46.320
There it is.
Don't worry, tree, I got this.

15:46.403 --> 15:49.740
Here I am, Thorny!
Take your best shot.

15:53.869 --> 15:55.996
I think. We'll see.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.223
What have I done?

16:15.140 --> 16:16.892
How did this happen?

16:17.351 --> 16:20.020
All I ever wanted
was to protect the green...

16:21.271 --> 16:22.773
and now I've ruined it.

16:36.203 --> 16:39.164
We used to be... friends.

16:39.248 --> 16:41.750
<i>-There used to be balance.</i>

16:46.463 --> 16:48.632
<i>But after a while,</i>
<i>all I saw was</i>

16:48.716 --> 16:51.301
<i>the constant taking, taking.</i>

16:52.845 --> 16:54.638
<i>Finally realizing that</i>

16:54.722 --> 16:56.765
<i>they were depleting</i>
<i>our resources.</i>

16:59.226 --> 17:01.937
<i>They take but never give back.</i>

17:02.021 --> 17:04.314
<i>Never giving it rest.</i>

17:04.398 --> 17:06.316
<i>Never giving it respect.</i>

17:07.651 --> 17:09.820
<i>They were killing the jungle.</i>

17:09.903 --> 17:12.156
<i>I couldn't take it any longer.</i>

17:12.239 --> 17:15.701
<i>I snapped and became a monster.</i>

17:23.500 --> 17:25.377
<i>I couldn't sit back</i>
<i>and let it happen.</i>

17:27.463 --> 17:30.299
<i>But I could never get back</i>
<i>to who I used to be.</i>

17:37.639 --> 17:40.225
I... I didn't see it like that.

17:40.309 --> 17:44.438
I'm sorry, Thorn.
I didn't know. I...

17:52.488 --> 17:54.448
â™ª

18:08.295 --> 18:09.379
Ta-da!

18:12.382 --> 18:14.301
Go. Up there.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.261
Stretch your wings.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.225
Go ahead.

18:32.820 --> 18:34.196
You, too.

18:34.279 --> 18:35.823
You just gotta
spin your little tails.

18:53.507 --> 18:56.802
It got so dark, I lost myself.

18:56.885 --> 18:58.929
It was selfish to keep
Birdie from flying

18:59.012 --> 19:01.390
while trying to shut...

19:01.473 --> 19:02.724
you all out.

19:07.729 --> 19:09.690
You were right
to defend the jungle,

19:09.773 --> 19:13.819
but the thing is,
this jungle <i>is </i>unnatural.

19:13.902 --> 19:16.947
The Shard, it knocked
everything out of balance,

19:17.030 --> 19:18.532
including your friendships.

19:18.615 --> 19:20.742
How do we start over?

19:22.536 --> 19:24.621
Well, my friend Amy would say,

19:24.705 --> 19:26.331
"Talk to each other."

19:26.415 --> 19:28.000
But she's a little corny.

19:30.335 --> 19:33.297
I don't know.
She sounds pretty great.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.340
Yeah.

19:35.424 --> 19:36.758
You are.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.933
â™ª

19:50.314 --> 19:52.691
We have to acknowledge
our part in this

19:52.774 --> 19:54.860
if we're ever
going to live in harmony.

19:55.986 --> 19:56.862
Me, too.

20:05.037 --> 20:08.373
I'm not crying, you're crying.

20:15.631 --> 20:17.382
Oh, snap! The Shard!

20:19.843 --> 20:21.887
These two'll find it.

20:21.970 --> 20:24.097
Sorry, friends, gotta go!
Gotta go fast!

20:40.989 --> 20:44.534
Little Birdie told me
where the Shard is! Yes!

20:52.000 --> 20:54.127
Speeding dogs don't lie!

21:00.050 --> 21:02.386
<i>Sonic! I'm lost in the void!</i>

21:02.469 --> 21:04.638
-Shadow?!
<i>-You have to keep moving!</i>

21:04.721 --> 21:07.641
Ha-how could--? Whoa!

21:21.405 --> 21:23.448
Ahhh!

21:24.783 --> 21:26.994
Ahhh!

21:27.077 --> 21:28.161
Ahhh!

21:28.245 --> 21:29.830
Whaa!

21:32.791 --> 21:35.502
I'm back in New Yolk City?

21:35.585 --> 21:37.087
How did I end up back--?

21:37.170 --> 21:41.216
For a better tomorrow!

21:41.300 --> 21:42.426
Who's with me?

21:42.509 --> 21:44.344
Oh, no.
