WEBVTT

00:10.360 --> 00:14.447
Hi, we're back.
We have Chester on the line.

00:14.614 --> 00:16.824
- How can I help you?
- 'I don't know.

00:17.033 --> 00:22.580
'I've had a lot of fights with my wife
lately. She feels I'm wasting my life.'

00:22.789 --> 00:26.334
- Spinning your wheels?
- 'Huh? I don't follow.'

00:29.962 --> 00:34.675
This problem might be too complex
for the few seconds remaining.

00:34.884 --> 00:38.012
Call tomorrow.
I'll make sure you get on first thing.

00:38.221 --> 00:40.973
- 'It's tough to get through.'
- Tell you what.

00:41.182 --> 00:44.477
When I get off the air,
I'll pick up and try to help.

00:44.644 --> 00:46.896
Take your time.

00:48.731 --> 00:53.986
I've got to scoot. Bulldog's up after
the news with the Gonzo Sports Show

00:54.153 --> 00:57.239
on "What's wrong
with our Seattle Mariners?"

00:57.406 --> 01:02.119
lf you haven't commented on that
in the last 18 years, do it today!

01:02.328 --> 01:04.997
So long, all.

01:07.750 --> 01:11.462
- That was a pretty good show.
- Mm-hmm.

01:11.670 --> 01:14.423
- What's that?
- "Seattle Magazine".

01:14.632 --> 01:17.468
The hottest hundred men
and women in town.

01:17.676 --> 01:19.929
- Let me see!
- What about Chester?

01:20.095 --> 01:22.139
You heard him - he can wait.

01:24.350 --> 01:27.561
- You're not in there.
- Oh.

01:28.854 --> 01:32.149
- Niles isn't in there, either.
- Cool!

01:33.692 --> 01:36.945
Oh, my! Who is this fresh angel?

01:37.112 --> 01:42.409
- Madeline Marshall, No 47.
- Makes her own line of sportswear.

01:42.618 --> 01:44.620
She's a stunning woman!

01:44.787 --> 01:48.916
"Single, patron of the arts,
MBA at Stanford."

01:49.124 --> 01:53.337
Well, if you have to go to school
on the West Coast...

01:54.797 --> 01:57.591
"What she looks for most in a man:

01:58.550 --> 02:02.596
"someone who knows how to...listen."

02:04.223 --> 02:06.391
Roz, I'm in love!

02:06.558 --> 02:09.645
- Why don't you ask her out?
- Yeah, right!

02:09.811 --> 02:15.150
- What have you got to lose?
- She doesn't even know who I am.

02:15.317 --> 02:18.904
- You're on the radio.
- Then why am I not in there?

02:19.112 --> 02:21.365
Those are important people.

02:21.531 --> 02:24.284
- I'm going to call her office.
- No!

02:24.493 --> 02:26.495
- Hey, Doc!
- Bulldog.

02:26.703 --> 02:30.540
Just did an hour on the Stairmaster.
What do you think?

02:30.749 --> 02:33.251
Like a couple of cherry tomatoes,
huh?

02:35.420 --> 02:39.299
Thank you. You've just
put me off salads for a month.

02:39.507 --> 02:43.219
- What have we got here?
- Is Madeline Marshall there?

02:43.428 --> 02:47.390
- Dr Frasier Crane.
- You know this Madeline Marshall?

02:47.599 --> 02:51.519
No. I found her attractive
and Roz insisted on calling her.

02:51.686 --> 02:54.898
Small wonder. Smart, sophisticated...

02:55.106 --> 02:58.026
And I like a woman
who doesn't wear underwear.

02:58.193 --> 03:02.322
- She's wearing a business suit.
- It was a general comment.

03:02.530 --> 03:07.452
Hi. Miss Marshall? Could you
please hold for Dr Crane? Thank you.

03:09.537 --> 03:13.208
Oh, all right.
Once more unto the breach.

03:17.629 --> 03:21.591
Hello. This is Dr Frasier Crane.
I know we've never met,

03:21.799 --> 03:25.845
but you seem like a fascinating
person. I was just wondering...

03:26.054 --> 03:31.809
Would you be so good
as to have dinner with me tonight?

03:31.976 --> 03:36.689
That's very gracious of you to accept,
Chester, but I didn't mean you.

03:38.733 --> 03:43.196
- Roz, you could have said line two!
- You could have asked.

03:46.073 --> 03:50.536
Mr Crane, is the proper term
"serial killer" or "serial murderer"?

03:50.745 --> 03:55.041
- "Serial killer". Why?
- Letting Mum know what's going on.

03:55.249 --> 03:57.418
She worries if she doesn't hear from me.

03:58.836 --> 04:01.839
How about a nice
Havana with that wine?

04:02.006 --> 04:03.841
Thank you!

04:04.008 --> 04:08.054
- Aren't Cuban cigars illegal?
- I've got a friend in Customs.

04:08.262 --> 04:13.517
He confiscated them from a teacher
who "needed them for a lesson".

04:13.684 --> 04:18.773
When are people going to learn
that rules apply to everyone?

04:19.940 --> 04:25.279
I love to see a man with a cigar.
It reminds me of my grandfather.

04:25.446 --> 04:30.618
All day, he'd sit with a great big
stogey dangling from his lips.

04:30.826 --> 04:33.537
The hours we used to spend on his lap,

04:33.704 --> 04:37.708
playing with the yellow whiskers
beneath his nose.

04:37.875 --> 04:42.254
He'd take out his teeth with
the cigar in them and chase us.

04:42.421 --> 04:46.175
We'd all laugh and laugh.

04:46.383 --> 04:48.886
Then suddenly his mood would change,

04:49.053 --> 04:52.056
and we'd all have to run for our lives.

04:53.140 --> 04:55.976
You can't buy memories like that.

04:58.145 --> 05:03.483
Eddie, I know you took the socks
that go with this suit. Where are they?

05:06.987 --> 05:11.116
Brown socks with a blue suit?
I think not. Try again.

05:14.077 --> 05:15.912
Thank you.

05:16.079 --> 05:19.333
- Where are you off to?
- He has a blind date.

05:19.499 --> 05:22.502
- Really? With whom?
- Madeline Marshall.

05:22.669 --> 05:26.631
She has her own sportswear concern.
According to "Seattle Magazine",

05:26.798 --> 05:29.843
she is the 47th hottest person
in Seattle.

05:30.010 --> 05:32.137
- That article was a sham.
- Not in it, huh?

05:32.345 --> 05:34.723
Can you believe it?

05:34.931 --> 05:39.394
Well, I'm off. You know,
I have a good feeling about tonight.

05:39.603 --> 05:42.647
I have a song in my heart,
a dance in my step

05:42.856 --> 05:44.983
and dog saliva around my ankles.

05:46.000 --> 05:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:57.704 --> 05:59.539
Thank you.

05:59.706 --> 06:02.792
This is wonderful!
I've never heard of this place.

06:02.959 --> 06:07.839
You're in for a treat. "Degas" is the
pinnacle of French country dining.

06:08.047 --> 06:13.011
Ettienne Degas, his wife and daughter,
will treat us like family.

06:14.971 --> 06:18.933
I couldn't help being flattered
when you said you knew my show.

06:19.142 --> 06:21.269
Are you a devoted listener?

06:21.477 --> 06:24.147
Actually, my secretary listens to it

06:24.314 --> 06:28.359
but I try to catch what I can
when I cross through her office.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.739
Bonsoir. Welcome to "Degas".

06:32.905 --> 06:37.660
Our special tonight
is our fabulous crispy duck.

06:37.827 --> 06:42.206
Oh, yummy! And a bottle
of Châteauneuf-du-Pape '89.

06:42.415 --> 06:46.377
The only one in that decade
to outdo the '88.

06:46.586 --> 06:49.422
Excellent choice.

06:51.174 --> 06:56.012
- You know wine.
- I acquaint myself with fine things.

06:56.179 --> 06:59.015
What would you like
to know about me?

06:59.849 --> 07:04.186
For starters, why is a man
as charming as you still out there?

07:04.353 --> 07:07.064
Well, actually, I...

07:07.273 --> 07:10.109
- I'm recently divorced.
- Thank goodness.

07:10.276 --> 07:15.364
I thought you were one of those single
men still living with his parents!

07:17.700 --> 07:21.954
Yeah. Your heart really has
to go out to those sad sacks.

07:22.955 --> 07:26.709
- I'm divorced also.
- We have so much in common.

07:26.876 --> 07:31.088
- I caught him with my sister.
- Fabulous!

07:31.297 --> 07:36.093
- The same thing happened to me.
- Boy, my sister gets around.

07:36.302 --> 07:38.637
You've kept your sense of humour.

07:39.722 --> 07:42.725
Yeah, but it isn't easy to get over, is it?

07:42.891 --> 07:45.102
No.

07:45.311 --> 07:50.649
No, it's not.
Those nights when you ask yourself,

07:50.816 --> 07:54.778
"How could this have happened?
Was I insensitive?"

07:54.987 --> 07:58.907
- "Was I a workaholic?"
- "Was I not good enough in bed?"

07:59.074 --> 08:02.286
You reach for anything.

08:03.745 --> 08:06.039
(Arguing in French)

08:06.248 --> 08:09.168
(Father) What are you telling me?
You are pregnant?

08:09.334 --> 08:11.545
(Daughter)
Maman, I told you he would do this!

08:11.753 --> 08:15.257
(Father)
Who is the father? I want to know!

08:15.424 --> 08:20.012
(Daughter) I won't tell you!
(Father) When I find him, I'll kill him.

08:20.178 --> 08:23.557
(Father) I'll snap his neck
like a stale baguette!

08:24.850 --> 08:27.894
- Your wine.
- Yes, that's the one.

08:28.103 --> 08:30.605
I will just go and open it.

08:30.772 --> 08:34.025
- This will be a night to remember.
- Oh, yes.

08:34.192 --> 08:36.278
(Father) Are you going to tell me?
(Daughter) No!

08:36.445 --> 08:39.489
There's a clam house up the road.

08:39.698 --> 08:45.162
No, I think we're getting the most
for our entertainment buck right here.

08:45.370 --> 08:48.123
(Mother) What did I ever see in you?

08:48.290 --> 08:53.211
(Father) You don't think I'm sick of you?
You and your cuttlefish bisque!

08:53.378 --> 08:56.172
I spit in your cuttlefish bisque!

08:57.382 --> 09:01.845
Voilà. It's a delicacy
from our little village in France.

09:02.053 --> 09:04.097
Cuttlefish bisque.

09:08.059 --> 09:11.563
What are the odds?
I had cuttlefish for lunch.

09:11.730 --> 09:16.484
(Father) You can leave my house,
Yvette! Go to wherever he is!

09:19.737 --> 09:23.658
Are you not the one
who gives advice on the radio?

09:23.825 --> 09:27.579
- You listen to my show?
- No, but my Sous-chef does.

09:27.745 --> 09:30.623
I hear you
as I walk through the kitchen.

09:30.832 --> 09:33.876
Monsieur, you must help me! Ettienne!

09:35.044 --> 09:39.549
lf everyone comes out, how will
you know when our duck is crispy?

09:39.757 --> 09:44.846
- This is the doctor from the radio.
- Ah, oui!

09:45.013 --> 09:47.181
You must talk to my husband.

09:47.348 --> 09:51.352
He does not understand
that these things happen.

09:51.519 --> 09:55.648
Talk to this tramp!
Do you believe my daughter?

09:55.857 --> 09:58.192
You should meet my sister.

09:58.359 --> 10:03.823
- I wasn't pregnant when we got married!
- I wish I had been killed in the war!

10:04.031 --> 10:06.951
It's hard to get killed
when you run away!

10:09.704 --> 10:11.956
Silence! Silence!

10:15.042 --> 10:18.504
Both of you try to calm down.
I'll see what I can do.

10:18.713 --> 10:24.093
Monsieur Degas, you are angry now.
That is a temporary emotion.

10:24.301 --> 10:26.595
You are devastated because you think

10:26.762 --> 10:30.599
the bond between father
and daughter is broken.

10:30.808 --> 10:33.310
She is no longer your little girl.

10:33.477 --> 10:37.690
But that's not possible.
That bond cannot be broken.

10:37.898 --> 10:43.153
Not even by that young man in the
corner who is obviously the father.

10:45.823 --> 10:48.158
Come out! It's all right.

10:49.702 --> 10:51.745
We need more water.

10:54.248 --> 10:58.794
You? You can't even get water
in a glass! How did you do this?

11:02.589 --> 11:05.342
Monsieur Degas, please.

11:06.385 --> 11:10.430
Hold your daughter in your arms.
Tell her how you really feel.

11:12.266 --> 11:14.142
Yvette...

11:23.193 --> 11:25.904
Thank you, monsieur. Thank you!

11:28.115 --> 11:33.245
You are a god! And you,
mademoiselle, are very lucky.

11:33.453 --> 11:35.539
I'm starting to realise that.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.960
Just another evening out with...

11:40.127 --> 11:42.170
Dr Frasier Crane.

11:49.386 --> 11:50.804
(Door opens)

11:50.971 --> 11:53.014
- Hi, Roz.
- Hey.

11:53.223 --> 11:55.225
Again, thank you.

11:55.392 --> 11:59.604
It's OK. You've thanked me
every day for the last two weeks.

11:59.813 --> 12:04.150
But if it hadn't been for you,
I never would have met...Madeline.

12:05.819 --> 12:10.949
We went out again last night.
It's perfect between us! We talk, laugh...

12:11.157 --> 12:16.496
Just stop. Did it ever occur to you
that, since I'm in a dating drought,

12:16.663 --> 12:20.917
to hear you prattling on
about your storybook romance

12:21.084 --> 12:24.504
might be a bit irritating?

12:24.671 --> 12:29.133
No, it hadn't. You're right,
I'm sorry. I can be so insensitive.

12:29.342 --> 12:33.388
But Madeline's helping me with that.
She is so good.

12:33.596 --> 12:35.598
- God!
- Sorry.

12:35.765 --> 12:39.644
I haven't felt this way
since my divorce.

12:39.852 --> 12:41.938
Everything seems so right!

12:42.105 --> 12:46.651
You know, I haven't said this
out loud, but here goes.

12:46.859 --> 12:50.905
She could be the woman
I spend the rest of my life with.

12:52.031 --> 12:57.412
Go. Go do that! Get married.
Have a couple of kids.

12:57.620 --> 13:01.207
Move to the country. Buy a puppy.
Live happily ever after!

13:01.374 --> 13:04.877
Just don't tell me about it!
I need a boyfriend.

13:07.296 --> 13:09.549
Dear Roz.
Dear, silly Roz.

13:09.715 --> 13:11.968
Dear, silly, horny Roz.

13:14.720 --> 13:17.181
- Look! It's...
- That must be Madeline.

13:18.391 --> 13:22.520
Madeline, hi! Hi, Roz, Madeline!
Madeline, Roz!

13:22.728 --> 13:25.231
What a surprise to see you!

13:25.398 --> 13:29.402
I have a meeting with a buyer nearby
in ten minutes

13:29.568 --> 13:31.779
and I wanted to talk to you.

13:31.987 --> 13:33.989
Please, have a seat.

13:36.492 --> 13:42.289
You know we both agreed we didn't
want to rush into the physical part,

13:42.498 --> 13:47.002
that we'd save ourselves
for the right moment.

13:47.169 --> 13:49.213
It's now?

13:50.756 --> 13:52.800
No, actually.

13:53.008 --> 13:58.055
I was wondering what you thought
about us going away for the weekend,

13:58.263 --> 14:00.265
just the two of us.

14:00.432 --> 14:04.103
Well, I'd miss my favourite shows,
but sure.

14:05.688 --> 14:08.565
I was thinking two, three days.

14:14.780 --> 14:17.491
I was thinking more like a week.

14:19.034 --> 14:22.454
OK, now for the really big question:
when?

14:22.621 --> 14:25.165
Well, the minute we get there.

14:27.793 --> 14:32.547
No. Actually, I meant, when do we go?

14:32.714 --> 14:35.759
Oh, oh, yes. Let's see.

14:35.968 --> 14:40.430
Now, let's see, I am good for...
the week of the 16th.

14:40.639 --> 14:43.475
The 16th... No. Sweeps week.

14:43.642 --> 14:47.813
- How about the 23rd?
- No. No. Trade show. 30th?

14:47.979 --> 14:50.857
- No.
- That puts us into the next month.

14:51.066 --> 14:53.068
No. No. No. The 20th?

14:53.235 --> 14:55.987
No.

14:56.154 --> 14:59.991
We're both obviously too busy.
We'll do it another time.

15:00.158 --> 15:02.202
- Yes, I...
- I've got to run.

15:09.834 --> 15:11.920
- Let's go tomorrow!
- You're on!

15:12.087 --> 15:15.715
- The perfect place is Bora Bora.
- Hubba hubba!

15:15.924 --> 15:19.594
- I'll arrange it!
- I'll meet you at the airport!

15:19.761 --> 15:22.430
- Bye!
- Bye. Oh, Madeline...

15:23.431 --> 15:25.517
Bye.

15:27.185 --> 15:32.982
Hello. You don't know me, but I saw
your picture in "Seattle Magazine".

15:37.028 --> 15:39.072
(Up-tempo tune)

15:48.623 --> 15:51.167
They don't write
songs like that any more.

15:51.376 --> 15:54.379
This is really what men do,
isn't it, Dad?

15:55.713 --> 16:00.551
Yeah, this and some things outdoors,
but we'll just stick to this.

16:02.220 --> 16:04.597
These last few nights
have been very pleasant,

16:04.806 --> 16:09.310
you and me sitting together,
appreciating these fine cigars.

16:09.477 --> 16:12.396
Who would have thought
a Cuban peasant

16:12.563 --> 16:15.399
would bring a father and son together?

16:15.566 --> 16:20.571
Yes. Must make that dime he gets
for a day's work a lot more satisfying.

16:25.493 --> 16:28.954
I'm going to miss
these little sweethearts.

16:31.248 --> 16:34.752
- Ooh, now, there's a talent!
- I'll say!

16:39.673 --> 16:44.595
- Just how do you do that?
- It's simple. It's all in the tongue.

16:44.762 --> 16:49.141
Just purse your lips
and pucker up like a little goldfish.

16:49.350 --> 16:52.144
That's it. Just like that. Very good.

16:53.687 --> 16:55.731
Have you got it?

17:00.110 --> 17:05.031
- Niles, what are you doing?
- I'm learning how to blow smoke.

17:05.866 --> 17:07.701
Where?

17:11.288 --> 17:14.833
- I asked you to smoke on the balcony.
- It's cold.

17:15.041 --> 17:19.922
All right. Maybe an errant ash
will flick off and ignite your chair.

17:21.381 --> 17:23.425
What's the matter?

17:23.634 --> 17:25.928
Madeline and I are going
to Bora Bora.

17:26.136 --> 17:29.556
Why do bad things
happen to good people?

17:30.641 --> 17:35.062
- When did this come about?
- About an hour ago.

17:35.228 --> 17:37.272
We got caught up
in a moment of passion

17:37.481 --> 17:40.817
and now I'm going halfway around
the world with a woman I hardly know.

17:40.984 --> 17:43.945
It isn't like me.
I'm getting caught up in the romance.

17:44.154 --> 17:49.201
I'm not sure about the psychological
side, but it seems good to me.

17:49.409 --> 17:53.288
But what if we hate each other
and we're stuck together?

17:53.455 --> 17:57.209
That won't happen.
You'll come back even more in love.

17:57.375 --> 18:02.631
Even worse! lf it goes perfectly,
we'll start talking about commitment

18:02.839 --> 18:05.258
and living together
and marriage and...

18:05.467 --> 18:08.261
Your trepidation is well founded.

18:08.470 --> 18:12.974
You can move a relationship along
too fast and marry too hastily

18:13.141 --> 18:17.145
and then find a few years down
the line she isn't right for you.

18:17.312 --> 18:21.608
Then what happens
if you meet the right person?

18:21.775 --> 18:23.860
You can't act upon it

18:24.027 --> 18:27.697
because you're trapped
in a stale Maris.

18:33.369 --> 18:35.121
Marriage.

18:36.706 --> 18:38.708
I have to go now.

18:43.546 --> 18:47.467
Did you feel a spark
when you met this woman?

18:48.885 --> 18:51.012
- Like fireworks.
- Then go for it.

18:51.220 --> 18:56.476
It doesn't happen often. It's like when
I met your mother at a crime scene.

18:56.643 --> 18:58.686
Hester was a psychiatrist.

18:58.895 --> 19:03.191
The department would have her
run up a profile of a suspect.

19:03.399 --> 19:08.362
The first time I met her was over
the chalk outline of a murder victim.

19:08.529 --> 19:10.615
One look at her hair

19:10.823 --> 19:15.161
silhouetted against the flashing
blue light and I was a goner.

19:15.328 --> 19:20.166
She drew a smile on the head
of the outline and I drew eyes

19:20.333 --> 19:23.252
and soon we were laughing like kids.

19:23.419 --> 19:25.463
You're a ghoul.

19:26.505 --> 19:31.844
I was joking. We couldn't draw on the
outline. They hadn't moved the body.

19:32.678 --> 19:36.390
Your corpse-strewn romance
notwithstanding,

19:36.557 --> 19:39.101
I still feel skittish about this.

19:39.310 --> 19:43.022
Dr Crane, if you'd like
a feminine point of view,

19:43.230 --> 19:46.650
just shut your bloody cakehole
and go!

19:46.859 --> 19:51.489
You took a chance and called her,
and you've been happy ever since.

19:51.697 --> 19:56.327
- That is true.
- Yeah, so make another bold move.

19:56.493 --> 19:59.288
- Yeah, go on!
- You won't regret it.

20:00.206 --> 20:04.501
- All right, I'll do it.
- Attaboy! That's terrific!

20:04.710 --> 20:08.380
I know you just want me
out of the house for a week.

20:08.547 --> 20:11.633
It will be sweet, won't it?

20:23.228 --> 20:25.272
Thank you.

20:27.733 --> 20:31.487
This is gorgeous!
I'm so glad you suggested it.

20:31.653 --> 20:34.406
It's more beautiful than I remember.

20:34.573 --> 20:39.661
The natives say that Bora Bora
is the doorway to heaven.

20:39.828 --> 20:44.333
This...could be
the doorway to heaven for us.

20:47.419 --> 20:49.463
I'm glad you said that first.

20:49.671 --> 20:53.300
I didn't want it to seem like
our trip was just about sex,

20:53.467 --> 20:56.053
but...who are we kidding?

21:04.936 --> 21:09.649
- I'm a little hot in these clothes.
- I'm sweating like a pig.

21:11.526 --> 21:13.737
- I'll be right back.
- Oink.

21:38.553 --> 21:41.055
(Madeline) Frasier.

21:46.978 --> 21:50.648
- Oh, my God.
- Frasier?

21:52.150 --> 21:54.444
Oh, my God!

22:05.538 --> 22:10.668
# Hey baby, I hear the blues are calling
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:10.835 --> 22:12.545
# Mercy!

22:12.712 --> 22:17.717
# And maybe I seem a bit confused
Yeah, maybe, but I got you pegged

22:19.677 --> 22:24.724
# But I don't know what to do with those
tossed salads and scrambled eggs

22:26.642 --> 22:28.895
# They're calling again

22:29.103 --> 22:32.231
# Scrambled egg's all over my face!

22:32.440 --> 22:35.901
# What is a boy to do? #

22:36.110 --> 22:39.447
Good night everybody!
