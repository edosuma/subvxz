knows about the money now,

to stop pussyfooting around.

08:45.653 --> 08:47.486
money's a little tight for me right now.

So maybe $100 doesn't
mean that much to you,

08:50.491 --> 08:52.457
but some of us could really use it.

08:52.459 --> 08:56.094

me, I'd fire half the staff.

09:39.973 --> 09:42.307
No, don't put that on the cake.

09:49.717 --> 09:52.351
Uh, no, no, no, no. I'm just browsing.

09:52.353 --> 09:53.585

10:04.198 --> 10:05.864
but, I mean,

10:05.866 --> 10:08.633
how much am I gonna really use
a motorized rotisserie burner?

10:08.635 --> 10:12.037

10:12.039 --> 10:16.007

of some pretty crazy jams.

10:18.178 --> 10:19.911

10:19.913 --> 10:22.914
Okay. Charcoal or gas?

10:22.916 --> 10:26.618
If you need to ask, then
you are not a grill guy.

10:26.620 --> 10:29.154
- Yes, exactly. That's good.
- Yeah. Yeah.

10:29.156 --> 10:31.456
I should use that in one of my videos.

10:31.458 --> 10:33.191

10:33.193 --> 10:35.494

grilling videos on YouTube.

a big deal or anything.

- Wow.
- Total strangers. Yeah.

10:43.470 --> 10:46.438
That's, uh... I guess, then, one could say

10:46.440 --> 10:49.040
you almost need this.

10:49.042 --> 10:51.576
Yeah, maybe, maybe. Let
me run it by my wife.

10:51.578 --> 10:53.145

somewhere, and I'll...

Yeah, all right.

You think you're a bigger
Minions fan than me?

11:16.203 --> 11:19.337
I don't think so, 'cause if you were,

11:19.339 --> 11:22.374
you would have a Minions blanket

11:22.376 --> 11:25.644
and a Minions night-light

11:25.646 --> 11:28.713

11:28.715 --> 11:31.783

One second. Hey, babe, what's up?

11:35.322 --> 11:38.390
Uh, yeah, yeah, I just wanted
to run something by you.

11:38.392 --> 11:40.091
Oh, I'm really busy right now. Can it wait?

11:40.093 --> 11:41.960
Well, I was just at home, and I realized

11:41.962 --> 11:44.129
we were out of AA
batteries, so I had the...

11:44.131 --> 11:45.630
Oh, AA batteries. I'll bring some home.

11:45.632 --> 11:46.998
Okay, I love you, bye.

11:47.000 --> 11:49.968
That was the head Minion,

11:49.970 --> 11:54.139
and he told me to tell you to tell your mom

11:54.141 --> 11:56.107
to get you a new Xbox.

11:56.109 --> 12:00.479
Um, she couldn't talk. [chuckles]

12:00.481 --> 12:02.481

12:02.483 --> 12:05.650

12:05.652 --> 12:06.852
- Yeah.
- Huh?

12:06.854 --> 12:08.954
- Yeah, I tried.
- Yeah.

12:08.956 --> 12:10.355
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

12:10.357 --> 12:11.556
- Yeah.
- All right.

12:11.558 --> 12:13.692
- Yeah.
- Look out, cookout.

12:13.694 --> 12:15.193

12:15.195 --> 12:17.229

12:18.573 --> 12:20.941
Trust me, you don't want the RX 5.

12:20.943 --> 12:22.576
The Vilano Forza's the way to go.

12:22.578 --> 12:24.911
The RX 5 got five spokes on RoadPro,

12:24.913 --> 12:26.179
and it's half the price.

12:26.181 --> 12:28.782
- Mm, okay.
- What's that mean?

12:28.784 --> 12:33.186

used to own the 5, okay?

12:43.632 --> 12:45.265
But, hey, you know what?

12:45.267 --> 12:47.701
I like to focus on the positive.

12:47.703 --> 12:49.503
I'll ring you up for the RX-5.

12:49.505 --> 12:52.973
Actually, let's go with the Vilano.

12:52.975 --> 12:54.441
Hell, yeah!

12:54.443 --> 12:56.776
And let's get you one of
these fancy racer helmets too.

12:56.778 --> 13:00.013
"I wish I had a better helmet"

I don't know. Something about
her car catching on fire.

13:20.202 --> 13:21.535
The point is, she was late.

13:21.537 --> 13:24.204
So call an Uber. Exactly.

13:24.206 --> 13:26.406
I mean, she walked all the
way here from Guatemala,

14:21.363 --> 14:23.597

yourself, just for once.

to making a $1,000 sale,

14:59.901 --> 15:02.836

So will the videos.
Jonah's already invested.

18:37.359 --> 18:39.125
I wouldn't use the word "invested."

18:39.127 --> 18:40.393
We're 90 10 partners.

18:40.395 --> 18:41.694
I thought you said 80 20?

18:41.696 --> 18:42.796
Stop it, Jonah.

18:42.798 --> 18:44.197
For once in my life,

18:44.199 --> 18:48.010
I want to give myself permission
to do something for myself.

18:48.110 --> 18:50.377
For once in your life, Adam?

18:50.379 --> 18:51.945
- Yes.
- Come on.

18:51.947 --> 18:54.247
- What about the kickboxing gym...
- Yeah.

18:54.249 --> 18:56.716
- Or the Reggaeton album...
- Ooh.

18:56.718 --> 18:59.186
And the home brewed beer?

18:59.188 --> 19:01.621
Wow. That is so low that
you would bring that up.

19:01.623 --> 19:03.590
- That is still aging.
- It smells.

19:03.592 --> 19:05.559
Yeah? Jonah says I have potential.

19:05.561 --> 19:06.313
What about that?

19:06.413 --> 19:08.270
Oh, oh, that's what Jonah says?

19:08.370 --> 19:10.437
Tell her.

19:10.439 --> 19:12.105
Um, sorry, ma'am?

19:12.107 --> 19:13.139
Crock-Pots?

19:13.141 --> 19:16.409
Yes, Crock-Pots are just over here.

19:35.163 --> 19:36.863
So who won?

19:36.865 --> 19:38.932
Gold Team won, Myrtle.

19:38.934 --> 19:41.101
He's told you that, like, six times.

19:42.537 --> 19:45.305
Victory is sweet. Hoo hoo.

19:45.307 --> 19:46.473
But you know what?

19:46.475 --> 19:49.576
The real victory is
that we did it together.

19:49.578 --> 19:50.977
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

19:50.979 --> 19:52.779
Wait. You're on the Red Team.

19:52.781 --> 19:55.315
I'm on the Take One of Each T-shirt Team.

This feels about right

20:03.825 --> 20:06.493
[sighs] Yeah.

20:06.495 --> 20:08.161
Is your husband still here?

20:08.163 --> 20:10.297
No, he went home.

20:10.299 --> 20:12.599
He seems nice.

20:12.601 --> 20:14.267
[chuckles]

20:14.269 --> 20:16.136
Yeah, he is.

20:17.606 --> 20:19.773
Hey, uh, I'm really sorry about...

20:19.775 --> 20:22.676
It's not your fault.

20:24.446 --> 20:25.812
So how'd you guys meet?

20:25.814 --> 20:27.981
I don't really want to
talk about my home life.

20:27.983 --> 20:29.349
Got it.

20:33.021 --> 20:37.657
I was in high school, and
he was a football player.

20:43.765 --> 20:45.165
"You hired him.

20:45.167 --> 20:47.968
That's why, if it was up to
me, I'd fire half the staff.

20:47.970 --> 20:51.204
No, don't put that on the
cake. Glenn, make him stop. See?

20:51.206 --> 20:52.872
Not so cocky now, are you, Dina?

20:52.874 --> 20:54.808
I swear to God, one of these days,

20:54.810 --> 20:56.142
I'm going to strangle you.

20:56.144 --> 20:58.812
I'd like to see...

20:58.814 --> 20:59.980
you try.

20:59.982 --> 21:02.115
Is that a threat? You threatened me."

21:05.187 --> 21:06.953
Is it working?
