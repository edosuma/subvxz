WEBVTT

00:09.375 --> 00:10.833
-There you go.

00:11.458 --> 00:12.416
It's funny.

00:13.083 --> 00:14.291
You would think going out

00:14.375 --> 00:17.833
and being clearly better
than your competition would be enough.

00:18.333 --> 00:24.375
But often, too often, it takes
one more thing to get over that hump.

00:25.083 --> 00:26.708
Something I got as a kid.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.458
A white man's stamp of approval.

00:30.625 --> 00:36.208
America promises equal opportunity
to everyone, no matter who you are.

00:36.708 --> 00:43.333
You can go to a good school,
get a great job, live in a great house.

00:43.916 --> 00:45.708
But none of that is possible

00:46.458 --> 00:48.625
without that white man's
stamp of approval.

00:49.500 --> 00:50.666
Don't believe me?

00:51.208 --> 00:53.333
Here. I'll prove it to you.

01:08.291 --> 01:13.083
In 2011, Kelley Williams-Bolar
spent nine days in jail

01:13.166 --> 01:15.833
for sending her daughters
to a high-performing school

01:15.916 --> 01:17.083
outside of her district.

01:17.166 --> 01:21.208
She had unknowingly broken a law
called boundary-hopping.

01:22.208 --> 01:26.083
In the land of opportunity,
that law is meant to make sure

01:26.166 --> 01:30.208
poor, underprivileged folk
don't better educate themselves

01:30.291 --> 01:33.000
without that white man's
stamp of approval.

01:39.833 --> 01:42.250
Then there's the question of employment.

01:42.875 --> 01:45.291
Can you get a good job
earning a living wage

01:45.375 --> 01:47.750
without that white man's
stamp of approval?

01:48.500 --> 01:52.916
Making minimum wage,
he would have to work 140 hours a week,

01:53.000 --> 01:57.375
or better put,
24 hours a day, six days a week,

01:57.458 --> 01:59.000
to earn a living wage.

01:59.875 --> 02:03.083
Now, if that makes you
go in to work tomorrow

02:03.166 --> 02:06.083
and ask your boss for a raise,
be prepared.

02:06.166 --> 02:09.708
You'll probably need that
white man's stamp of approval.

02:09.791 --> 02:13.291
So now you wanna buy a house,
and you have to get a loan.

02:14.125 --> 02:16.666
I think you can see where this is going.

02:17.416 --> 02:24.083
In 2015, 27.4% of Black applicants
were denied mortgages,

02:24.166 --> 02:26.833
more than twice that of white applicants.

02:27.333 --> 02:32.708
And when Black applicants were approved,
they usually paid higher interest rates.

02:33.541 --> 02:37.375
The top lenders are JP Morgan,
Wells Fargo, and Quicken Loans.

02:37.458 --> 02:40.750
Wanna take a guess
who runs these companies?

02:43.333 --> 02:46.833
As long as we need
that white man's stamp of approval,

02:46.916 --> 02:51.375
our fate will be in the hands
of those who may not think we qualify.

02:52.291 --> 02:54.833
Some people will say the system is broken.

02:55.416 --> 02:58.416
I'm here to tell you
it was intentionally built this way.

03:13.375 --> 03:16.958
Hey. If I score 100 touchdowns
this season, will you get me a car?

03:17.666 --> 03:22.208
Colin, that's about 10 a game.
I mean, that's a lot, even for you.

03:23.458 --> 03:24.291
Fine.

03:25.458 --> 03:28.041
What if I make varsity?

03:28.750 --> 03:33.083
You are a freshman. I'd be shocked
if they even consider you for varsity.

03:33.666 --> 03:34.708
True, but...

03:36.041 --> 03:40.458
Okay, if I make varsity, or JV starter,
then you have to get me a car.

03:40.541 --> 03:43.541
How about we just get you
to tryouts on time? Let's move.

03:43.625 --> 03:45.375
Varsity's already started.

03:47.833 --> 03:48.833
Whoa.

03:55.000 --> 03:56.625
I can't wait for that to be me.

03:56.708 --> 03:57.833
You'll get there.

03:58.750 --> 04:01.625
Right now,
you better focus on your competition.

04:05.041 --> 04:07.416
Oh, yeah. I got this.

04:12.750 --> 04:16.041
Competition?
I wasn't even worried about it.

04:16.541 --> 04:19.750
I knew that if I do what I do,
there is no competition.

04:19.833 --> 04:23.708
Good morning, coaches.
Colin Kaepernick, quarterback.

04:25.333 --> 04:26.416
Kaepernack.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.333
No, uh, Kaepernick.

04:28.416 --> 04:30.083
Yeah, I've seen you play baseball.

04:30.166 --> 04:33.000
You're also a solid quarterback
and receiver, I heard.

04:33.083 --> 04:34.291
That's a good thing.

04:34.375 --> 04:37.333
Arms that skinny, we can get you catching
the ball if you're not throwing it.

04:38.416 --> 04:41.250
Um, respectfully, coaches,
I'm here to play QB.

04:41.333 --> 04:43.166
Hey, lighten up. It's a joke.

04:43.250 --> 04:46.083
What do you know
about progressions? Reading defenses?

04:46.166 --> 04:48.000
Man versus zone, safety reads,

04:48.083 --> 04:51.041
middle of the field open or closed,
yeah, I know all that stuff.

04:51.125 --> 04:55.083
Okay. Coach Berg oversees
the JV and the freshman teams.

04:55.166 --> 04:57.541
Now, if he says you got it, you got it.

04:58.166 --> 04:59.416
Hey, coach.

04:59.500 --> 05:02.666
How's it going, son?
Real excited about this kid.

05:03.875 --> 05:07.291
Gotta tell you, coach, real prospect.
Hell of an arm.

05:10.250 --> 05:11.833
Colin. Say.

05:12.416 --> 05:13.250
What's up?

05:13.333 --> 05:14.500
Peep your competition?

05:15.083 --> 05:16.208
Competition?

05:16.916 --> 05:18.125
For you guys, maybe.

05:18.208 --> 05:21.875
Wow, so it's like that now?
That's the way we riding this year?

05:21.958 --> 05:24.875
Bro, you know I'm a baseball player.
I don't care about football.

05:24.958 --> 05:27.541
Just want my letterman jacket,
impress some easy breezies.

05:27.625 --> 05:28.583
Easy breezies?

05:28.666 --> 05:31.375
Unless that jacket
got chips in it, that ain't happening.

05:31.458 --> 05:33.333
And I'm not talking about potato chips.

05:38.208 --> 05:41.250
Ah, shit.
Colin already got his game face on.

05:41.750 --> 05:42.833
Let's warm up.

05:46.958 --> 05:49.625
First thing you do
when you walk on the field

05:50.125 --> 05:52.000
is size up the competition.

05:53.541 --> 05:57.500
And you gotta know
they're sizing you up too.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.791
What's up with old boy, anyway?

06:06.291 --> 06:10.250
He's from the Bay.
Some fancy private school or whatever.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.083
Sound kind of nervous there, Colin.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.583
Gonna let the white boy
from San Fran take your spot?

06:16.666 --> 06:17.500
No.

06:18.916 --> 06:21.791
Just curious about the kid
who's about to be my backup.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.583
Okay. Let's get it then.

06:25.416 --> 06:27.250
First up, Jordan and Colin.

06:27.916 --> 06:31.375
-Good luck.
-Yeah. You too.

06:31.458 --> 06:35.916
When I woke up that morning,
I told myself I was gonna put on a show.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.208
Okay, let's go.

06:37.291 --> 06:40.333
-Show coach! Go!
-Set, hut!

06:40.416 --> 06:42.125
That's exactly what I did.

06:43.208 --> 06:44.416
Nice arm, Kaepernick.

06:44.500 --> 06:45.791
-Go!
-Come on, Jordan.

06:45.875 --> 06:48.333
Don't get me wrong, Jordan was okay.

06:48.416 --> 06:50.083
But I was in my zone.

06:50.166 --> 06:51.166
Again!

06:51.250 --> 06:53.666
D slant, D slant, let's go, hut!

06:53.750 --> 06:56.916
Three step drop,
hitting short routes all day.

06:57.791 --> 06:59.416
Big guns, big fun.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.666
Time for the big one. Deep routes!

07:01.750 --> 07:03.166
-Let's go!
-Hustle!

07:07.541 --> 07:08.625
Come on, dude.

07:08.708 --> 07:12.041
Jordan has a wet noodle arm. Am I right?

07:12.125 --> 07:14.625
But when it came time
to show what I could really do,

07:14.708 --> 07:17.625
I knew I had JV QB locked up.

07:17.708 --> 07:19.291
Set, hut!

07:25.958 --> 07:27.333
Oh, shit.

07:29.208 --> 07:30.291
Oh!

07:31.208 --> 07:32.333
Yes!

07:37.125 --> 07:39.458
Okay, listen up. Receivers.

07:39.541 --> 07:42.458
Lopez, freshman team.

07:42.541 --> 07:44.500
Payo, JV.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.875
Grubik, JV. Millen, JV.

07:49.833 --> 07:52.041
Gritts, JV.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.875
Yeah, that's what's up, baby.

07:53.958 --> 07:55.208
We dominating.

07:55.708 --> 07:57.083
The quarterbacks.

07:57.791 --> 08:02.791
Jordan Johnson on JV,
Colin Kaepernick, freshman team.

08:07.375 --> 08:08.208
Coach.

08:10.875 --> 08:14.916
Look, I know you're disappointed,
but trust me, I know what I'm doing.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.583
Tell me what I did wrong.

08:16.666 --> 08:20.208
You got a ton of natural talent.
No one's trying to take that from you.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.750
Being a quarterback's
more than throwing the ball.

08:23.250 --> 08:26.625
I need to know my quarterback
has full command of the offense.

08:26.708 --> 08:30.583
And Johnson?
He's the prototype I'm looking for.

08:39.916 --> 08:43.958
What kind of answer is that?
I don't even know what that means.

08:45.375 --> 08:48.166
-I know.
-You're gonna have to prove him wrong.

08:50.166 --> 08:53.000
Why am I always the one
that has to prove them wrong?

08:54.916 --> 08:58.750
Because you're the one
who's strong enough to do it.

09:00.041 --> 09:01.083
That's right.

09:01.666 --> 09:02.875
That doesn't help at all.

09:04.166 --> 09:05.083
It's all I got.

09:06.250 --> 09:07.125
Is this, uh...?

09:10.083 --> 09:13.458
-Is this pork?
-It's the patty of the month club.

09:18.666 --> 09:19.500
Break!

09:20.416 --> 09:22.458
Mom was right. I could handle it.

09:22.541 --> 09:25.541
And being mad about it
wasn't going to change the situation.

09:25.625 --> 09:28.083
So instead, I embraced it.

09:28.166 --> 09:31.375
Blue 13, Blue 13, set, hut!

09:33.291 --> 09:38.291
That whole season was about me
showing them that they made a mistake.

09:38.375 --> 09:39.750
Hut!

09:44.416 --> 09:48.541
I wasn't just there to play.
I was there to dominate.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.666
Good season, Kaepernick.

10:19.750 --> 10:22.416
Conference champs
ain't nothing to be sneezed at.

10:22.500 --> 10:23.958
Even if it is a freshman team.

10:24.041 --> 10:27.708
Yeah, well, I'll be ready
for the top spot next season, coach.

10:27.791 --> 10:30.750
Look, I can't stop you
from trying out, Kaepernick,

10:31.333 --> 10:33.750
but I can make
the decision easier for you.

10:33.833 --> 10:35.416
We've got a quarterback.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.291
And instead of being overly ambitious,

10:37.375 --> 10:40.250
he's focused on
leading his team and getting better.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.041
Maybe you should do the same, huh?

10:53.125 --> 10:55.625
There he is. Did you talk to coach?

10:56.208 --> 10:57.333
He talked to me.

10:58.000 --> 11:01.083
-What did he say?
-They already have a quarterback.

11:01.583 --> 11:02.625
And it ain't me.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.833
-What are you doing?
-Calling the school.

11:19.041 --> 11:21.333
Call the superintendent if I have to.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.916
Put the phone down, Teresa.

11:28.208 --> 11:29.375
Then you handle it.

11:39.625 --> 11:40.583
Actually...

11:47.458 --> 11:48.375
Come in.

11:51.625 --> 11:52.708
Hey.

11:54.458 --> 11:55.333
Homework?

11:56.125 --> 11:56.958
Yeah.

12:02.208 --> 12:09.208
Listen, I talked to a guy
who knows a guy who knows... a guy.

12:11.666 --> 12:12.500
Okay.

12:13.166 --> 12:17.375
The guy he knows is named Roger Theder.

12:17.958 --> 12:18.791
Who?

12:20.416 --> 12:21.250
"Who"?

12:22.375 --> 12:26.208
Uh, the quarterback guru
who worked for the Colts and Chargers,

12:26.291 --> 12:28.083
and when he was at Cal

12:28.166 --> 12:32.208
he helped make Steve Bartkowski
the number one pick in 1975.

12:32.708 --> 12:33.541
That's who.

12:35.958 --> 12:39.375
-Okay.
-Colin, look at me.

12:42.916 --> 12:44.958
Roger's agreed
to sit down and meet with you

12:45.041 --> 12:47.125
to talk about
training with him this summer.

12:47.625 --> 12:49.125
If he says yes...

12:50.750 --> 12:52.875
that's gonna change things for you.

12:55.291 --> 12:57.125
You wanna be varsity QB, right?

13:03.791 --> 13:04.875
So...

13:06.208 --> 13:07.500
when do I meet him?

13:10.125 --> 13:11.041
Why you?

13:15.166 --> 13:17.416
Well, I'm a really hard worker.

13:17.500 --> 13:20.458
So what? Hard workers are a dime a dozen.

13:21.666 --> 13:24.500
Goddamn waitress is a hard worker.
Probably harder than you.

13:24.583 --> 13:27.791
Sir, Colin's a smart kid
and a top-notch athlete.

13:27.875 --> 13:28.791
I'm asking you.

13:34.666 --> 13:37.625
Being a quarterback, being a leader,
is really important to me--

13:37.708 --> 13:39.208
A lot of people wanna be.

13:53.708 --> 13:58.416
Being a quarterback
is all I've ever wanted my whole life.

14:00.083 --> 14:03.041
Every time I close my eyes,
I read coverages.

14:03.125 --> 14:07.208
Every night I sleep,
I dream of playing in the Super Bowl.

14:07.875 --> 14:11.125
It's the only way I know how to operate,
and the only way I want to.

14:11.208 --> 14:14.958
Being a quarterback
isn't an option for me. It's in my blood.

14:16.416 --> 14:18.500
I'll get there one way or another.

14:24.083 --> 14:26.333
I'll do whatever it takes to show you.

14:32.166 --> 14:33.166
We start in June.

14:33.875 --> 14:37.458
Every Saturday,00 a.m. sharp,
for eight weeks. Skyline High School.

14:38.666 --> 14:40.458
Be warmed up and ready to go.

14:40.541 --> 14:43.125
Yes, sir. Yes, coach. Thank you.

14:52.791 --> 14:55.666
-I thought he said00 a.m.
-He did. Shit.

14:58.458 --> 14:59.541
Oh, my pack.

15:06.291 --> 15:07.916
You better get out there.

15:27.708 --> 15:28.708
Coach.

15:29.208 --> 15:31.625
Kaepernick. Join that group over there.

15:35.000 --> 15:36.458
Left.

15:39.166 --> 15:40.000
Left.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.458
Left.

15:43.791 --> 15:47.041
One of the first things I learned
when I got to work with Roger Theder

15:47.958 --> 15:49.500
was that I had a lot to learn.

15:49.583 --> 15:50.791
Right.

15:53.791 --> 15:56.083
What happened? Throw that with your purse?

15:56.166 --> 15:59.958
-No, coach, I just wasn't ready.
-Don't care. Get it right or get out.

16:00.041 --> 16:04.458
You shouldn't even be with this group.
You got the arms of a malnourished infant.

16:04.541 --> 16:05.583
Go join the baby squad.

16:05.666 --> 16:07.708
-Coach.
-Baby squad. Now.

16:21.166 --> 16:22.000
Yo.

16:22.958 --> 16:26.166
Don't take it personally.
He's just hella old school.

16:26.750 --> 16:31.041
Trust me, someday you'll realize
he's the easier version of all of this.

16:31.125 --> 16:33.375
I just wanted him to know I'm not weak.

16:33.458 --> 16:35.750
That's the problem.
He's not worried about that.

16:36.291 --> 16:40.750
He doesn't wanna hear shit from you.
Just listen to learn. You'll get there.

16:43.833 --> 16:48.083
More than anything else,
you gotta see every play on the field.

16:48.583 --> 16:52.458
Randall Callaway was there.
So was Don Evers and Michael Peters.

16:54.541 --> 16:55.375
Damn it.

16:56.916 --> 17:02.208
So Randall's out here telling me
that the QB has to shut up, listen.

17:02.291 --> 17:04.000
QB's supposed to be a leader, right?

17:04.500 --> 17:07.083
How am I supposed to lead
if I gotta keep my mouth shut?

17:07.166 --> 17:08.500
Who said this again?

17:09.083 --> 17:10.375
Randall Callaway.

17:11.750 --> 17:16.791
He's, like, top ten in the whole NCAA.
Definitely going pro after next season.

17:16.875 --> 17:20.041
Maybe he just means
to let your play do the talking for you.

17:20.625 --> 17:23.375
Maybe.
Or maybe he doesn't want you to waste time

17:23.458 --> 17:25.208
feeling sorry for yourself.

17:25.291 --> 17:27.083
Keep your head in the game.

17:28.666 --> 17:30.083
Yeah, maybe.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.041
Oh, now, don't get up.

17:32.125 --> 17:33.583
You need help, Mom?

17:36.208 --> 17:37.333
I'm good.

17:37.416 --> 17:38.708
Set, hut!

17:42.375 --> 17:45.291
No, no, no.
What'd I tell you about that coverage?

17:45.375 --> 17:47.208
Inside out. Look inside, then outside.

17:47.291 --> 17:50.333
Yes, sir. I just... Understood.

17:50.416 --> 17:53.083
You wanna run routes
and catch the ball, or be a QB?

17:53.583 --> 17:54.750
-QB.
-Go again.

17:54.833 --> 17:57.500
My mom was my mom,
but she was right.

17:57.583 --> 17:58.958
You have to know when to lead...

17:59.041 --> 18:00.583
-Set!
-...and when to follow.

18:01.083 --> 18:02.083
Hut!

18:04.333 --> 18:07.500
Yes, Kaepernick.
By highlighting the inside receiver,

18:07.583 --> 18:09.708
you're working
against the flow of the defense.

18:09.791 --> 18:13.250
-He's got a better shot of breaking free.
-Yes, sir.

18:15.083 --> 18:17.375
-Take five.
-Hike!

18:17.458 --> 18:21.333
Another thing I was learning,
if you're going to be a quarterback,

18:21.416 --> 18:24.041
you have to believe
you're the best quarterback.

18:24.125 --> 18:27.916
Somebody call ESPN and tell them,
I'm the new prototype!

18:28.791 --> 18:29.875
Prototype?

18:29.958 --> 18:31.791
Even when others don't.

18:33.916 --> 18:36.291
When you call yourself the prototype,

18:36.375 --> 18:40.750
you're saying you're the epitome,
the perfect example of your position.

18:40.833 --> 18:43.541
But what are the skills
and attributes it takes

18:43.625 --> 18:45.916
to be the prototypical quarterback?

18:46.000 --> 18:47.750
Let's imagine a video game.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.958
You get to create
your version of the perfect quarterback.

18:51.041 --> 18:54.291
You can give him
any skills and attributes you want.

18:54.375 --> 18:55.875
You're the shot caller.

18:56.375 --> 19:01.875
We're talking height, weight, body type,
arm strength, speed, quickness.

19:01.958 --> 19:06.250
What would he look like when you're done?
Probably like you, right? Makes sense.

19:06.333 --> 19:09.166
Who wouldn't wanna create
their star and leader of their team

19:09.250 --> 19:10.416
in their own image?

19:11.000 --> 19:13.666
Well, it's no different in real life.

19:13.750 --> 19:17.666
More often than not, the people deciding
who get to play quarterback in real life

19:17.750 --> 19:20.250
want a quarterback who looks like them.

19:23.625 --> 19:26.750
And because of their limited imaginations,

19:27.250 --> 19:29.750
in a league that's over 70% Black,

19:30.791 --> 19:33.625
less than a third of the quarterbacks
are Black.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.208
And that's an all-time high.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.541
So, yeah,
you can claim to be the prototype.

19:41.166 --> 19:43.791
You can show the world
that you should be the standard.

19:44.333 --> 19:48.041
But until the people
who are running things change their minds,

19:48.125 --> 19:50.708
you'll be an anomaly, a freak.

19:51.333 --> 19:52.458
A unicorn.

19:53.083 --> 19:59.000
While their prototypes will all have
at least one attribute in common.

20:03.500 --> 20:06.958
I'm seeing some progress,
but a lot of you got a ways to go.

20:07.541 --> 20:11.583
People are not gonna give it to you,
you gotta earn it. All right?

20:12.291 --> 20:14.166
Now, get out of here. See you next week.

20:15.583 --> 20:18.625
Colin, you're working
with the big boys from now on. Be ready.

20:25.375 --> 20:27.166
-Feels good, right?
-Yeah.

20:28.166 --> 20:32.125
All I had to do was shut up and listen.
Thanks for the advice.

20:32.708 --> 20:35.416
What you mean? I never said that.

20:36.000 --> 20:36.916
Huh?

20:37.291 --> 20:40.250
I didn't say nothing
about no shutting up. I said listen.

20:40.833 --> 20:44.166
Listen to what people are telling you.
Learn what they're really saying.

20:44.833 --> 20:48.000
-Dig me?
-Yeah. I think so.

20:49.166 --> 20:51.791
I watched you work your ass off
and level up your game.

20:52.291 --> 20:55.125
You're a quarterback, Colin.
Never doubt that.

20:55.958 --> 20:59.625
-And just like that, touchdown.
-Thank you.

21:01.708 --> 21:05.750
New year. I'm still gunning for that car.
You didn't forget our bet, did you?

21:06.916 --> 21:11.250
-As far as I'm concerned, it still stands.
-Okay. Still stands.

21:12.833 --> 21:14.375
-Hey, coach.
-Yeah, yeah.

21:14.875 --> 21:16.250
Keep an eye on my boy.

21:16.333 --> 21:18.791
I had him working with Roger Theder
in the offseason.

21:18.875 --> 21:20.625
-Really?
-Yeah, you'll see the difference.

21:20.708 --> 21:22.250
I'll keep an eye out.

21:28.208 --> 21:29.875
He said he'd keep an eye on him.

21:30.791 --> 21:32.000
Kaepernick.

21:34.625 --> 21:35.541
Okay.

21:36.958 --> 21:39.875
Okay. All right, knees up, boys. Come on.

21:41.416 --> 21:45.333
-This is tryouts for varsity, not JV.
-Who's that skinny kid?

21:46.166 --> 21:47.250
Go, gentlemen.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.791
Get going, get it going.

21:52.375 --> 21:54.166
Everybody, you know the drill.

21:54.250 --> 21:59.083
Let's hit the 50-yard line.
I want Johnson, Kaepernick, up front.

22:02.750 --> 22:04.791
-Coach Park?
-Something wrong?

22:04.875 --> 22:06.916
No. Uh, the opposite, actually.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.791
I learned a lot from Coach Berg last year.

22:09.875 --> 22:14.500
One thing being that there's a lot more
to a QB than just throwing the ball.

22:14.583 --> 22:17.625
-You gotta be able to command an offense.
-Exactly.

22:17.708 --> 22:20.541
So I was wondering
if instead of uncovered routes,

22:20.625 --> 22:22.000
we do some seven on seven.

22:25.125 --> 22:28.583
Okay. Change of plans, gentlemen.
Defense, let's move!

22:28.666 --> 22:31.791
Quarterbacks need to prepare
more than anybody else.

22:31.875 --> 22:34.500
-Give me Blue 51, pass.
-Blue 51.

22:34.583 --> 22:36.416
Set, hut!

22:38.458 --> 22:41.208
Hey, hey, 52 is the mike, 52's the mike!

22:41.291 --> 22:42.541
Razor, razor, razor!

22:42.625 --> 22:44.041
Set, hut!

22:45.541 --> 22:48.000
Trey 52 Red, pass.

22:48.083 --> 22:50.708
Red 52, set, hut!

22:54.375 --> 22:55.250
Red 52.

22:55.333 --> 22:57.375
Red 52, hut!

23:01.500 --> 23:03.666
Damn it! Go to the ball!

23:03.750 --> 23:05.583
Last one. You call it.

23:05.666 --> 23:07.208
Bring it in, bring it in.

23:07.958 --> 23:11.958
We're Even... Even 150 Smash.

23:12.541 --> 23:14.541
-You sure?
-Shut up, Jay.

23:14.625 --> 23:18.916
Listen up, Doubles 119 Post Rail,
Doubles 119 Post Rail on one, on one.

23:19.000 --> 23:21.416
Tyler, get the inside release on the snap,

23:21.500 --> 23:24.166
that way, you have leverage,
and he can't get to you.

23:24.250 --> 23:26.625
If you see that safety hang back,
just cut it short,

23:26.708 --> 23:29.041
and we'll slide right underneath it.
All right?

23:29.750 --> 23:32.125
Go ahead, Colin,
with your quarterbacking ass.

23:32.208 --> 23:34.833
-All right, here we go, boys. Ready?
-Break!

23:35.666 --> 23:38.250
Set, go!

23:41.041 --> 23:42.291
Set, set, set!

23:42.375 --> 23:44.875
Red 7, set, hut!

23:47.875 --> 23:50.416
I believed I was the best QB that day.

23:51.916 --> 23:53.250
Great job.

23:53.333 --> 23:55.541
Get outta here!
We'll see you all tomorrow.

23:56.041 --> 23:59.000
And I believed
my competition believed it too.

23:59.083 --> 24:02.791
Hey, Kaepernick. Nice job.

24:02.875 --> 24:06.750
But it turned out
my competition wasn't only on the field.

24:06.833 --> 24:11.291
I know Johnson wasn't at his best today.
But he was my guy last year.

24:11.375 --> 24:14.375
He's got the right stuff,
just get him with the right receivers.

24:14.458 --> 24:16.375
They had the same receivers.

24:16.458 --> 24:18.875
I was talking with Kaepernick's father.

24:18.958 --> 24:22.208
The kid spent the offseason
training with Roger Theder,

24:22.291 --> 24:24.458
and you know
Theder does not take just anybody.

24:25.916 --> 24:28.833
Do we really want
a poster boy running varsity?

24:28.916 --> 24:30.666
Or do we want a quarterback?

24:40.041 --> 24:43.250
I guess we better head over
to the car dealership, son.

24:44.833 --> 24:47.458
Wait, really?

24:48.000 --> 24:50.583
Are you serious? You're serious.

24:50.666 --> 24:52.708
No, I'm not serious.

24:56.250 --> 24:58.958
That's gotta be the meanest thing
you've ever done to me.

25:00.083 --> 25:02.041
You just rewarded yourself

25:02.125 --> 25:06.250
by seeing just how much
you can accomplish with hard work.

25:07.833 --> 25:09.833
I mean, congratulations...

25:11.583 --> 25:12.625
Quarterback.

25:18.250 --> 25:22.791
I never doubted myself.
I always knew I was a quarterback.
