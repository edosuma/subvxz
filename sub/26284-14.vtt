00:06.090 --> 00:07.466
<i>A fossil is formed</i>

00:07.550 --> 00:09.468
<i>when an organism,
preserved in sediment,</i>

00:09.552 --> 00:10.928
<i>undergoes physical compression</i>

00:11.012 --> 00:12.722

00:12.805 --> 00:15.307
<i>Less than one
ten-thousandth percent</i>

00:15.391 --> 00:17.893
<i>of living organisms
will become fossils.</i>

00:17.977 --> 00:19.103
<i>Isn't it amazing</i>

00:19.186 --> 00:22.314
<i>that something so fragile
can defy those odds,</i>

00:22.398 --> 00:24.316
<i>only to have this
happen to it?</i>

00:26.027 --> 00:27.862
I don't think
you did that right.

00:27.945 --> 00:30.156
All right, everyone.

00:30.239 --> 00:32.616
We'll pick it up here tomorrow.
If we're lucky,

00:32.700 --> 00:35.411
we may find a fossil as old
as lunch lady Phyllis.

00:37.788 --> 00:39.707
You people don't know
what's funny.

00:39.790 --> 00:41.333
Cooper!

00:43.169 --> 00:45.588
Will you put these away for me?

00:46.380 --> 00:47.548
Sure.

00:48.257 --> 00:50.176
You better watch yourself.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.219
I will, I... I really will.

00:52.303 --> 00:54.223
'Cause you know what's
gonna happen if you don't.

01:00.144 --> 01:01.353
Who was that?

01:01.437 --> 01:02.563
No one.

01:03.189 --> 01:04.440
Why did he push you?

01:04.522 --> 01:05.858
None of your business.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.860
But that was
a clear violation

01:07.943 --> 01:09.487
of the student
code of conduct.

01:09.570 --> 01:10.821
We need to tell on him.

01:10.905 --> 01:13.282
We're not telling on anyone.
Stay out of it.

01:13.365 --> 01:14.634
But the student code of conduct...

01:14.658 --> 01:16.994
Drop it.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.914
<i>So I did drop it...</i>

01:21.832 --> 01:22.958
<i>...for six whole minutes.</i>

01:23.042 --> 01:24.418
Excuse me, sir.

01:24.502 --> 01:26.587
When you're done urinating,
I'd like to ask you

01:26.670 --> 01:30.091
some questions about
social dynamics, intimidation,

01:30.174 --> 01:31.884
threats, et cetera.

01:33.636 --> 01:35.304
Finish up, no hurry.

01:36.472 --> 01:39.350
<i>♪ Nobody else
is stronger than I am ♪</i>

01:39.433 --> 01:42.186
<i>♪ Yesterday I moved a mountain ♪</i>

01:42.269 --> 01:44.772
<i>♪ I bet I could be your hero ♪</i>

01:44.855 --> 01:47.608
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

01:47.691 --> 01:51.612
<i>♪ I am a mighty little man ♪</i>

01:55.866 --> 01:57.076
What is your problem?

01:57.159 --> 01:58.619
Oh, I don't have
a problem.

01:58.702 --> 02:00.955
You should probably
wash your hands.

02:03.040 --> 02:04.834
I just witnessed
an altercation

02:04.917 --> 02:06.585
between you and Georgie Cooper.

02:06.669 --> 02:08.086
Altercation?

02:08.169 --> 02:10.923
A confrontation, a tussle.
Anyway,

02:11.006 --> 02:12.925
I'd just like to gather
more information

02:13.008 --> 02:14.718
for sociological purposes.

02:14.802 --> 02:18.639
Oh, I heard about you.
You're that smart kid.

02:18.722 --> 02:22.143
I'd like to be humble in this moment,
but yes, that's me.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.019
Sheldon Cooper, at your service.

02:24.103 --> 02:26.564
So Georgie's your brother?

02:26.647 --> 02:27.690
Correct.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.859
And you're trying
to protect him?

02:29.942 --> 02:33.988
Incorrect. I'm just curious
what he did to incur your wrath.

02:34.071 --> 02:35.823
Also, kudos on the hand washing.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.950
Your brother's a punk.

02:38.033 --> 02:40.578
I'm not familiar
with that terminology.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.788
He tried to hit on
my girlfriend.

02:42.872 --> 02:46.375
Interesting. So he openly
pursued your mate,

02:46.458 --> 02:47.793
and to re-assert dominance,

02:47.877 --> 02:49.879
you threatened him
with physical violence.

02:49.962 --> 02:51.714
Hell yeah, I did.

02:51.797 --> 02:53.507
I understand that.

02:53.591 --> 02:56.343
I often intimidate people
with my intelligence.

03:02.016 --> 03:03.934
Well, one of us scared him.

03:05.603 --> 03:08.022
All right.

03:08.105 --> 03:11.317
Next. Missy Cooper.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.113
Just a heads-up,
this is my good side.

03:17.114 --> 03:18.490
Okay...

03:18.991 --> 03:21.285
Do your parents know
you're wearing that makeup?

03:21.368 --> 03:23.037
Oh, yeah, my mom knows.

03:23.746 --> 03:26.916
You sure?
Because typically it's not allowed.

03:26.999 --> 03:29.335
If you don't believe me,
you can ask her.

03:29.919 --> 03:32.588
Okay, we're gonna
give her a call.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.425
Really?

03:37.051 --> 03:39.428
Good news, I just spoke
to Tommy Clarkson.

03:39.511 --> 03:41.513
What? Are you crazy?

03:41.597 --> 03:43.057
Nope, Mom had me tested.

03:43.140 --> 03:45.351
And Tommy's actually nicer
than you think.

03:45.434 --> 03:46.977
I told you to stay out of it.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.687
True, but what you
didn't tell me

03:48.771 --> 03:50.940
was that you were overly chummy
with his girlfriend,

03:51.023 --> 03:52.816
which is why he wants
to kick your bottom.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.027
I'm about to kick your bottom.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.406
I don't think so.

03:59.490 --> 04:00.741
H... Hey, Tommy.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.743
How you doing?

04:03.494 --> 04:06.830
You got a problem with him,
you got a problem with me.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.874
And just to make
his logic clear,

04:08.958 --> 04:10.584
you do have a problem with me.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.294
Don't listen to my brother,

04:12.378 --> 04:13.647
I don't have
a problem with anybody.

04:13.671 --> 04:15.714
You need to apologize.

04:15.798 --> 04:17.257
I... I'm very sorry.

04:17.341 --> 04:18.716
To him.

04:18.801 --> 04:20.386
I'm very sorry, Sheldon.

04:23.973 --> 04:25.266
Later, kid.

04:27.059 --> 04:28.602
See? He's nice.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.824
What were you even thinking?

04:41.907 --> 04:44.076
I was thinking I look hot.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.328
You know you're not allowed
to wear makeup.

04:46.412 --> 04:47.997
That's why I didn't tell you.

04:48.080 --> 04:50.624
And who gave it to you?
Heather B.? Heather M.?

04:51.208 --> 04:52.209
Meemaw.

04:52.293 --> 04:54.670
So your grandmother was okay
with you looking like this

04:54.753 --> 04:55.963
in your school pictures?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.965
If you don't believe me,
ask her.

04:58.048 --> 05:00.009
Oh, I'm going to.

05:01.051 --> 05:02.970
Really?

05:03.053 --> 05:04.471
<i>These are the plaintiffs,</i>

05:04.555 --> 05:06.098
<i>Valerie and Anthony Sines.</i>

05:06.181 --> 05:08.350
<i>Valerie claims she was
sitting on the front steps</i>

05:08.434 --> 05:10.644
<i>of her condo
with her cat Scampi,</i>

05:10.728 --> 05:13.897
<i>and that's when his dog
went after Scampi, injuring her.</i>

05:13.981 --> 05:16.692
- What are you watching?
- Go away.

05:16.775 --> 05:18.485
Are you angry with me?

05:18.569 --> 05:20.362
I don't want to see
your face right now.

05:20.904 --> 05:24.033
Very well, but I'd like
to watch <i>Professor Proton.</i>

05:24.116 --> 05:26.076
Did you hear me? Go away.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.037
Well, did you hear me?

05:28.120 --> 05:29.955
I'd like to watch <i>Professor Proton.</i>

05:30.039 --> 05:31.874
Too bad.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.000
Interesting.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.127
I wonder how my new friend
Tommy Clarkson

05:35.210 --> 05:36.420
would feel about this.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.130
Well, he's not here, is he?

05:38.839 --> 05:40.716
No, he's not.

05:40.799 --> 05:43.344
I guess I'll just
have to call him.

05:43.886 --> 05:45.012
You're kidding.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.599
<i>...the case of a taste of Scampi</i>

05:48.682 --> 05:50.225
<i>after these messages.</i>

05:50.309 --> 05:52.811
Are you going to put on
<i>Professor Proton?</i>

05:52.895 --> 05:53.937
No.

05:55.272 --> 05:56.565
Hmm.

06:04.156 --> 06:05.991
Okay, okay.

06:08.827 --> 06:10.371
Thank you.

06:12.706 --> 06:15.209
I didn't hear a
"you're welcome."

06:15.292 --> 06:16.293
<i>Shut up!</i>

06:16.377 --> 06:17.920
We'll work on that.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.297
<i>It's time for science!</i>

06:20.381 --> 06:22.466
Hello.

06:22.549 --> 06:25.219
Well, don't you
look like Madonna?

06:25.302 --> 06:26.553
Thank you.

06:26.637 --> 06:28.263
I was actually trying
to look like you.

06:28.806 --> 06:30.015
Thank you.

06:30.099 --> 06:32.643
Why would you give her makeup
without talking to me first?

06:32.726 --> 06:34.186
I didn't give her any makeup.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.730
Well, then one of you is lying.

06:36.814 --> 06:38.482
She is.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.793
Time to come clean, little lady.

06:39.817 --> 06:41.276
I ain't taking the hit
on this one.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.905
I took the makeup
from Meemaw's bag.

06:44.988 --> 06:48.075
Oh, Missy,
you are in a world of trouble.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.411
Calm down,
it's not that big a deal.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.912
It is so a big deal!

06:51.995 --> 06:54.373
She stole from you,
and then she lied about it.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.875
I know, but come on,
she's only ten.

06:56.959 --> 06:59.795
She's gonna do way stupider stuff
when she's older.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.004
Guaranteed.

07:01.088 --> 07:02.297
I don't care.

07:02.381 --> 07:04.633
She is my daughter
and you will be punished.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.053
Sorry, kid.

07:08.637 --> 07:10.556
I wish I was your daughter.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.101
Is that so?

07:15.310 --> 07:16.895
Well, guess what?

07:16.979 --> 07:18.188
You're sleeping here tonight

07:18.272 --> 07:20.649
because I don't feel like
being around either one of you.

07:22.526 --> 07:23.902
Great!

07:23.986 --> 07:27.156
Yeah, great.

07:33.454 --> 07:35.956
Georgie, be a lamb
and get me a Yoo-hoo.

07:36.039 --> 07:37.416
Get your own.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.335
Hmm. Are you sure
you want to speak to me

07:40.419 --> 07:41.920
in that tone of voice?

07:42.754 --> 07:44.798
Sheldon, I'm getting
real tired of this.

07:44.882 --> 07:47.342
That's too bad.
I'm enjoying it quite a bit.

07:48.969 --> 07:50.345
Still waiting on that Yoo-hoo.

07:50.429 --> 07:51.763
You think you're so tough now,

07:51.847 --> 07:53.390
- I swear, one day I'm...
- Hey.

07:53.474 --> 07:54.558
What's going on?

07:54.641 --> 07:55.976
Sheldon's being a jerk.

07:56.059 --> 07:57.352
That true?

07:57.436 --> 07:59.688
All I did was ask for a Yoo-hoo.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.211
He's leaving out
the part where he...

08:02.774 --> 08:05.777
Forget it.

08:06.528 --> 08:08.238
Great. Done.

08:09.031 --> 08:12.242
Georgie, at the risk
of repeating myself...

08:16.371 --> 08:18.665
And one from the back,
so it's cold.

08:27.299 --> 08:29.968
So when exactly
did you swipe my makeup?

08:30.052 --> 08:31.332
While you were
at bowling league.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.114
You don't have a key
to this house.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.139
How'd you get in?

08:34.222 --> 08:35.390
Can't tell you that.

08:35.474 --> 08:36.594
I might need to do it again.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.227
Unbelievable.

08:39.311 --> 08:42.438
And for future reference,
go lighter on the blush,

08:42.523 --> 08:44.399
or you'll end up looking
like Raggedy Ann.

08:44.483 --> 08:47.653
She got Raggedy Andy
looking like that.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.489
- He's her brother.
- Oh.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.991
I've been playing
with those dolls all wrong.

08:53.075 --> 08:55.202
All right, that'll do it.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.206
How old was Mom when
you let her wear makeup?

08:59.289 --> 09:00.415
I don't know.

09:00.499 --> 09:02.292
I didn't really
have rules like that.

09:02.376 --> 09:05.754
See? How come you're so cool
and she's such a dud?

09:05.837 --> 09:07.589
Well, I wouldn't call her a dud.

09:07.673 --> 09:08.882
What would you call her?

09:09.550 --> 09:11.552
Point is,
she wasn't always like that.

09:11.635 --> 09:12.886
What was she like?

09:12.970 --> 09:17.182
When she was a teenager,
she was just wild.

09:17.266 --> 09:19.226
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.061
She used to wait
until I went to sleep

09:21.144 --> 09:22.521
and then she would sneak out

09:22.604 --> 09:24.189
and get into trouble
with her friends.

09:24.273 --> 09:26.483
- My mom?
- Your mom.

09:26.567 --> 09:29.069
And then she would
climb up the tree

09:29.152 --> 09:31.488
on the side of the house
and sneak back in.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.365
Amazing.

09:34.241 --> 09:35.492
Is that how you're getting in?

09:36.034 --> 09:37.869
I will never tell you that.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.464
Everything okay?

09:50.799 --> 09:53.427
I'm getting tired of being
the bad guy around here.

09:53.969 --> 09:56.013
You're not the bad guy.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.306
Kids need boundaries.

09:57.389 --> 10:00.392
That is easy for you to say.
I am the only one doing it,

10:00.475 --> 10:02.269
and then everyone
resents me for it.

10:02.352 --> 10:03.937
Hey, you're not the only one.

10:04.021 --> 10:06.148
Just today, Georgie and Sheldon
were fighting,

10:06.231 --> 10:07.858
and I totally took care of it.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.776
Really? What was going on?

10:09.860 --> 10:13.071
They... you know, boy stuff.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.323
I...

10:14.406 --> 10:17.242
Don't worry. I got your back.

10:18.619 --> 10:20.746
Thank you. That means a lot.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.914
Teamwork, babe.

10:25.375 --> 10:27.919
Look right...

10:28.837 --> 10:30.422
here.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.341
That's my mom?

10:32.424 --> 10:36.386
Yep, the little queen
of darkness.

10:37.387 --> 10:39.097
Is she smoking a cigarette?

10:39.181 --> 10:42.476
Yep. Probably stole it from me.

10:43.018 --> 10:44.561
When did she stop being cool?

10:44.645 --> 10:47.230
Well, first of all,
smoking is not cool.

10:47.314 --> 10:49.149
- You do it.
- Yeah, well, next time

10:49.232 --> 10:51.318
I'm hocking up some black goo
out of my lung,

10:51.401 --> 10:53.654
I'll call you over
and you can see how cool it is.

10:53.737 --> 10:56.281
- Awesome.
- It is not awesome.

10:56.365 --> 10:58.867
And as far as your mom,
I think things started

10:58.950 --> 11:01.620
to turn around for her
when she gave birth to you.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.455
You mean me and Sheldon.

11:03.538 --> 11:05.499
No, I mean you.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.710
I mean, Sheldon was born fine,
but you were a different story.

11:08.794 --> 11:10.045
Why?

11:10.837 --> 11:12.297
Okay.

11:12.381 --> 11:16.927
Well, there was a point
where the doctors didn't know

11:17.010 --> 11:18.637
if you were gonna make it.

11:18.720 --> 11:22.766
And your mom got so scared,
and she made a promise to God

11:22.849 --> 11:26.311
that if you were okay,
that she would start reading

11:26.395 --> 11:29.648
the Bible, going to church...

11:29.731 --> 11:31.817
you know, that kind of stuff.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.027
So I'm the reason she's a dud?

11:34.111 --> 11:36.154
Your takeaway should be

11:36.238 --> 11:39.866
that you are the reason she's
such a good mom, which she is.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.469
And the next time
you hurt her feelings...

11:41.493 --> 11:43.203
which you will...

11:43.829 --> 11:47.541
you might remember
how much you mean to her.

11:50.085 --> 11:51.837
Now I feel bad.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.758
Good.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.638
<i>News of my friendship
with Tommy</i>

12:01.722 --> 12:03.223
<i>had apparently spread.</i>

12:03.306 --> 12:06.143
<i>So much so,
the student body was finally</i>

12:06.226 --> 12:09.396
<i>treating me
with the respect I deserved,</i>

12:09.479 --> 12:11.815
<i>even when Tommy wasn't around.</i>

12:15.277 --> 12:17.362
<i>This must be
how Carl Sagan felt,</i>

12:17.446 --> 12:19.448
<i>walking through
the halls of PBS.</i>

12:27.330 --> 12:29.040
<i>Like Superman in a phone booth,</i>

12:29.124 --> 12:32.544
<i>I was no stranger to undressing
in my gym locker.</i>

12:32.627 --> 12:34.171
<i>But not today.</i>

12:34.254 --> 12:37.299
<i>Thanks to Tommy,
I was invincible.</i>

12:39.009 --> 12:40.761
All right, get your butts
out to the gym.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.679
Wind sprints in one minute.

12:48.477 --> 12:50.187
Come on, Jason,
I'm gonna be late.

12:50.270 --> 12:51.396
Poor baby.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.068
Excuse me.

12:57.152 --> 12:58.570
I'd like to ask you
some questions

12:58.653 --> 13:01.865
about your use of intimidation
to dominate others.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.705
Are you trying
to get your ass kicked?

13:08.789 --> 13:13.084
No, I was just looking to open
a spirited dialogue.

13:13.168 --> 13:14.628
And you might want to unhand me.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.630
I'm friends with Tommy Clarkson.

13:16.713 --> 13:17.839
Is that so?

13:17.923 --> 13:19.216
Yes.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.052
Hello, Tommy.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.845
I have some unfortunate news.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.514
What's that?
I boasted

13:25.597 --> 13:27.474
to Jason Davies
that you're my friend,

13:27.557 --> 13:29.142
and things took
an unexpected turn.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.703
You're scheduled to
fight him at 3:00 p.m.

13:30.727 --> 13:32.521
on the basketball court.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.941
I don't want
to fight Jason Davies.

13:36.024 --> 13:38.860
I don't think you have a choice.
He was pretty adamant.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.280
Fine, I'll deal with it.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.908
You do have the option
of simply not showing up.

13:45.575 --> 13:47.202
That's not
how fights work, Sheldon.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.955
Why? Do they take attendance?

13:59.464 --> 14:01.758
What on Earth did you say
to Missy?

14:01.842 --> 14:04.219
- Why? What'd she do now?
- Nothing,

14:04.302 --> 14:05.637
she was an angel.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.055
I dropped her off at school,

14:07.138 --> 14:09.558
and she hugged me
in front of her friends.

14:09.641 --> 14:11.852
- Really?
- And not just any friends.

14:11.935 --> 14:15.021
Heather M. was there,
and that is a big deal.

14:15.105 --> 14:17.357
I just gave her
a little life advice.

14:17.774 --> 14:18.775
Like what?

14:18.859 --> 14:21.736
Nothing, just grandma stuff.

14:22.529 --> 14:26.491
There you go again,
being the good guy.

14:26.575 --> 14:29.494
Mary, you need to know

14:29.578 --> 14:32.539
you're doing a fantastic job
with those kids.

14:33.707 --> 14:34.958
You really mean that?

14:35.500 --> 14:37.752
- I really do.
- Thanks.

14:39.004 --> 14:42.340
I can't remember the last time
someone said I was a good mom.

14:43.592 --> 14:47.137
It's not a job that gets
a lot of compliments.

14:53.059 --> 14:56.187
Look at this.
My mother left me a note.

14:56.271 --> 14:58.690
"You can do better. Mom."

14:58.773 --> 15:01.401
Not "Love, Mom,"
not "XO, Mom,"

15:01.484 --> 15:03.069
just "Mom."

15:03.153 --> 15:04.404
<i>While Tam prattled on</i>

15:04.487 --> 15:06.072
<i>about some family nonsense,</i>

15:06.156 --> 15:08.533
<i>I couldn't help
but think about Tommy.</i>

15:08.617 --> 15:11.745
<i>At 3:00 pm, he was going
to engage in a schoolyard battle</i>

15:11.828 --> 15:13.622
<i>that was entirely my fault.</i>

15:13.705 --> 15:16.750
<i>I had to find a way to intervene,
but how?</i>

15:16.833 --> 15:18.501
Ooh, a Nutter Butter.

15:18.585 --> 15:20.170
Maybe she does love me.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.550
Come on now,
beat him in his face,

15:25.634 --> 15:26.760
Jason, let's do it!

15:26.843 --> 15:28.345
Fight! Fight! Fight!

15:28.428 --> 15:30.388
Fight! Fight! Fight!

15:32.432 --> 15:33.850
Come on, Jason. Kick his ass.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.359
<i>I didn't have the physical
stature to assist</i>

15:42.442 --> 15:44.903
<i>Tommy in a brawl,
but I did have something</i>

15:44.986 --> 15:47.072
<i>far more lethal:</i>

15:47.155 --> 15:49.699
<i>my once-in-a-generation brain.</i>

15:51.576 --> 15:54.329
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

16:01.795 --> 16:03.755
Didn't think you'd show up.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.508
Well, I did.

16:07.133 --> 16:08.551
Let's do this.

16:09.427 --> 16:10.428
Stop!

16:12.722 --> 16:15.600
You're not fighting Tommy,
you're fighting me.

16:17.018 --> 16:18.186
Oh, boy.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.813
Unless you want to shake hands

16:19.896 --> 16:23.066
and we all laugh about this
over a glass of milk.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.735
I think I'd rather kick
both your asses.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.862
I was afraid you'd say that.

16:28.697 --> 16:30.365
Are you familiar with the story

16:30.448 --> 16:32.409
of David and Goliath
from the Bible?

16:33.034 --> 16:34.411
Yeah.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.996
That's too bad.

16:36.079 --> 16:37.789
I had a nice speech prepared.

16:38.832 --> 16:40.583
I'll say it anyway.

16:40.667 --> 16:43.169
You may have
the size advantage,

16:43.253 --> 16:44.963
but like David and his sling,

16:45.505 --> 16:48.133
I also possess an
air-based weapon.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.887
So I'll give you
one more chance.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.848
Are you willing to step down?

16:56.141 --> 16:57.934
I'll tell you what:

16:58.018 --> 17:02.105
you take the first shot,
then it's my turn.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.190
Very well.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.152
Three...

17:08.862 --> 17:10.530
...two...

17:12.240 --> 17:13.616
...one.

17:21.165 --> 17:25.295
Ow! Son of a bitch!

17:33.386 --> 17:34.387
I'm going to run.

17:40.477 --> 17:42.312
<i>Conventional wisdom tells us</i>

17:42.395 --> 17:44.397
<i>that when one stands up
to a bully,</i>

17:44.481 --> 17:48.735
<i>the bully will inevitably back down
and respect you for your courage.</i>

17:48.818 --> 17:50.862
<i>My experience
suggests otherwise.</i>

17:50.945 --> 17:53.990
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

17:54.074 --> 17:55.658
<i>When Jason finally caught me,</i>

17:55.742 --> 17:58.536
<i>he had the good sense
not to commit assault and battery.</i>

17:58.620 --> 18:00.080
<i>This did not, however,
prevent him</i>

18:00.163 --> 18:02.207
<i>from imprisoning me
in his locker.</i>

18:02.290 --> 18:04.667
Anybody?

18:04.751 --> 18:06.795
<i>That was a very long night.</i>

18:06.878 --> 18:08.963
It doesn't smell good in here.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.048
<i>Very long.</i>
