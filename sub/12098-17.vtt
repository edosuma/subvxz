ANNOUNCER:
<i>We begin this week's episode</i>

01:21.648 --> 01:24.150
<i>shortly after Burt found out</i>
<i>he's not going to die.</i>

01:30.657 --> 01:33.158
I love to paint.

01:33.159 --> 01:34.159
Really.

01:34.160 --> 01:37.163
Yeah, even though in school,
I hated art.

01:39.165 --> 01:40.666
I wish I'd had
this rubber-based paint

01:40.667 --> 01:41.667
when you and Jodie were babies.

01:41.668 --> 01:43.669
Why? It's only white.

01:43.670 --> 01:44.670
It's washable.

01:44.671 --> 01:46.171
You have no idea what you kids

01:46.172 --> 01:48.173
used to smear
all over these walls.

01:48.174 --> 01:51.176
Crayons, finger paints,
gum, food...

01:51.177 --> 01:53.179
plus some unmentionables.

01:54.681 --> 01:56.181
Hi.
Hey, Burt.

01:56.182 --> 01:57.183
You want to help?

02:02.188 --> 02:03.689
Burt, what is it?

02:03.690 --> 02:05.190
What's happened?

02:10.196 --> 02:11.196
You don't like the color?

02:11.197 --> 02:13.699
I'll change the color.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.201
Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.704
Burt, what? Tell me.

02:18.705 --> 02:20.205
Burt, what is it?

02:23.710 --> 02:25.210
Died...

02:25.211 --> 02:27.713
Died? Someone died?

02:27.714 --> 02:28.714
I'm dying.
Someone died.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.215
Who died?

02:30.216 --> 02:31.216
I don't know.

02:31.217 --> 02:33.218
You don't know?

02:33.219 --> 02:34.219
No.

02:34.220 --> 02:35.721
Aw.

02:35.722 --> 02:36.722
He's such a sensitive man,

02:36.723 --> 02:37.723
even the death of a stranger

02:37.724 --> 02:39.725
makes him sad.

02:42.228 --> 02:44.730
I'm happy! I'm happy! I'm happy!

02:44.731 --> 02:46.732
He died. He died.

02:46.733 --> 02:49.735
He seems to be happy
this guy died.

02:49.736 --> 02:51.737
He's probably a very bad guy.

02:51.738 --> 02:52.738
Who was it, Burt?

02:52.739 --> 02:53.739
Who was this person who died?

02:53.740 --> 02:54.740
Not me.

02:54.741 --> 02:55.741
Wasn't him.

02:55.742 --> 02:57.242
It wasn't you.

02:57.243 --> 02:58.243
Wasn't me.

02:58.244 --> 02:59.244
That's great!

02:59.245 --> 03:00.746
Oh, Mare, Mare,
it was all a mistake.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.748
I'm not going to die.

03:02.749 --> 03:03.749
You're not?

03:03.750 --> 03:05.250
No!
Burt!

03:05.251 --> 03:06.251
Dan!
Burt!

03:14.260 --> 03:15.761
He's not gonna die!

03:15.762 --> 03:17.262
I didn't think he was.

03:17.263 --> 03:18.263
No, no.

03:18.264 --> 03:20.265
He was going to die.
He was going to die.

03:20.266 --> 03:21.767
We all are eventually.

03:21.768 --> 03:23.268
No, he was gonna die now.

03:23.269 --> 03:24.770
In five months.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.772
But not now.

03:26.773 --> 03:27.773
What are you talking about?

03:27.774 --> 03:29.775
Mare, Dr. Saxon told me

03:29.776 --> 03:31.777
I had this rare blood disease.

03:31.778 --> 03:33.278
I only had five months to live.

03:33.279 --> 03:35.280
But it was a mistake.
It was a mix-up.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.782
One of his other patients
had the disease,

03:36.783 --> 03:38.283
so he died, not me.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.285
You gave him your disease?

03:40.286 --> 03:43.789
Can't you get
in trouble for that?

03:43.790 --> 03:46.291
No, no, no.
It was the lab.

03:46.292 --> 03:47.292
They made a mistake.

03:47.293 --> 03:49.294
Oh, they gave him the disease.

03:49.295 --> 03:50.796
No, he already had the disease.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.798
It was his disease, not mine.

03:52.799 --> 03:54.299
Oh, so he took it back.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.801
I never had it.

03:55.802 --> 03:56.802
Did you want it?

03:56.803 --> 03:58.804
Danny.

03:58.805 --> 04:00.806
It was an accident.

04:00.807 --> 04:04.810
The lab put this guy's disease
on my records by mistake.

04:04.811 --> 04:06.311
Oh, well, it's a good thing

04:06.312 --> 04:08.313
they found out about it
before you died.

04:08.314 --> 04:11.316
Right.

04:11.317 --> 04:12.818
I guess this means

04:12.819 --> 04:15.320
no more <i>Guinness Book</i>
<i>of World Records,</i> huh?

04:15.321 --> 04:16.321
No.

04:16.322 --> 04:17.322
Aw...

04:17.322 --> 04:18.322
Come on, Dan, no, no, no.

04:18.324 --> 04:19.825
Listen,
now that I'm going to live,

04:19.826 --> 04:21.326
I'm going to stay alive
to enjoy it.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.829
Well, I'd better go
cancel that order.

04:23.830 --> 04:25.330
What order?

04:25.331 --> 04:26.832
The banana order.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.333
What banana order?

04:28.334 --> 04:29.835
Well, I figured
that the next attempt

04:29.836 --> 04:31.837
to get in the <i>Guinness Book</i>
<i>of World Records</i>

04:31.838 --> 04:34.339
could be
the longest banana split.

04:34.340 --> 04:37.843
The longest one on record
is 1 mile, 99 yards long,

04:37.844 --> 04:39.845
so I ordered bananas.

04:39.846 --> 04:41.346
How many?

04:41.347 --> 04:43.348
Not many. I'll cancel it.

04:43.349 --> 04:44.850
How many bananas?

04:46.352 --> 04:47.853
12 thou.

04:47.854 --> 04:49.855
12 thou? 12,000?

04:49.856 --> 04:52.357
He ordered 12,000 bananas?

04:52.358 --> 04:53.859
He's going to cancel it.

04:53.860 --> 04:57.362
You cancel an order like that,
Honduras is out of business.

04:57.363 --> 05:01.867
Mare, I'm not going to die.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.373
You almost died.
I can't believe it. I...

05:08.374 --> 05:09.374
You're telling me?

05:09.375 --> 05:11.877
The news alone almost killed me.

05:11.878 --> 05:12.878
You've been walking around,

05:12.879 --> 05:14.379
thinking
that you were going to die.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.881
Oh, Burt.

05:15.882 --> 05:18.383
It must have been awful.

05:18.384 --> 05:19.384
It was.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.886
The <i>Guinness</i> attempts, you know,

05:20.887 --> 05:22.387
took my mind off it
a little bit,

05:22.388 --> 05:23.889
but then at night,

05:23.890 --> 05:26.391
I'd lie in bed,
and I would remember.

05:26.392 --> 05:29.394
I never thought
I was going to see the baby.

05:29.395 --> 05:32.397
Now I'm going to see the baby,
Mare.

05:32.398 --> 05:36.401
I knew there was something wrong
with you.

05:36.402 --> 05:37.903
Why didn't you tell me?

05:37.904 --> 05:39.404
Why didn't you
share this with me?

05:39.405 --> 05:40.405
Mare. What? Please.

05:40.406 --> 05:42.407
I'm going to tell you
I'm going to die?

05:42.408 --> 05:43.408
You know how upset you get.

05:43.409 --> 05:44.910
Look at you now.

05:44.911 --> 05:46.412
You just found out
I'm going to live.

05:48.414 --> 05:49.915
Oh, Burt,
it must have been awful.

05:49.916 --> 05:52.417
Oh, Mare, it was.
It was awful.

05:52.418 --> 05:53.919
But, you know, in a strange way,

05:53.920 --> 05:54.920
it turned out good.

05:54.921 --> 05:55.921
Good?

05:55.922 --> 05:57.422
Yeah.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.925
Yeah, Mare, because now

05:59.926 --> 06:02.427
I can love you
and the baby and life

06:02.428 --> 06:03.929
so much more,

06:03.930 --> 06:06.431
because I know
in a very different way

06:06.432 --> 06:07.933
that someday

06:07.934 --> 06:09.434
I really am going to die,

06:09.435 --> 06:10.936
and the thought

06:10.937 --> 06:13.438
that I'm really
not going to be here

06:13.439 --> 06:15.941
really makes me be here.

06:18.444 --> 06:20.446
Give me a kiss, toots.

06:22.949 --> 06:23.949
Oh, Burt.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.451
Oh...

06:30.456 --> 06:32.457
ROD RODDY:
<i>You could win...</i>

06:32.458 --> 06:34.960
<i>a new car!</i>

06:44.291 --> 06:45.971
Gloria, for God sakes,
where have you been?

06:45.972 --> 06:47.472
You went out for movie magazines

06:47.473 --> 06:48.974
two days ago.

06:48.975 --> 06:50.475
Got lost.

06:50.476 --> 06:51.977
I was worried sick about you.

06:51.978 --> 06:53.979
I called the hospitals.

06:53.980 --> 06:54.980
I called the morgue.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.481
I didn't know
what happened to you.

06:56.482 --> 06:57.983
Couldn't sleep a wink.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.985
I just sat here waiting
and praying

06:59.986 --> 07:03.989
and watching game shows.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.992
Oh, Gloria, I love you so.

07:06.993 --> 07:07.993
You're it.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.494
You're the thing
I've been looking for

07:09.495 --> 07:11.496
all my life.

07:11.497 --> 07:15.000
You're my 10.

07:15.001 --> 07:16.501
What are you doing?

07:16.502 --> 07:17.502
What does it
look like I'm doing?

07:17.503 --> 07:19.004
Well, packing.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.505
Good.

07:20.506 --> 07:22.007
Are we moving someplace?

07:22.008 --> 07:23.508
Not we.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.510
"Not we."

07:25.511 --> 07:27.012
Are you moving somewhere?

07:27.013 --> 07:28.013
Bet your bottom.

07:28.014 --> 07:30.015
Where? Why?

07:30.016 --> 07:31.016
Out. Because.

07:31.017 --> 07:32.017
Are you leaving me?

07:32.018 --> 07:33.018
Oh, Gloria,

07:33.019 --> 07:34.019
you're not leaving me.

07:34.020 --> 07:35.520
Why are you leaving me, Gloria?

07:35.521 --> 07:37.022
I found someone better.

07:39.525 --> 07:40.525
Better?

07:40.526 --> 07:42.027
What do you mean by "better"?

07:42.028 --> 07:43.028
Better-dressed, better-looking.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.529
Better in bed.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.530
Better.

07:45.531 --> 07:48.033
Better-dressed?

07:51.537 --> 07:53.538
I'm taking the backgammon set.

07:53.539 --> 07:55.540
He's better at that too.

07:55.541 --> 07:57.042
Gloria, I thought you loved me.

07:57.043 --> 07:58.043
You said you loved me.

07:58.044 --> 07:59.544
How can you leave me?

07:59.545 --> 08:01.547
You're old.

08:03.549 --> 08:06.551
I beg your pardon?

08:06.552 --> 08:10.556
You're old and soft
and have hair in your ears.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.059
All right. Fine.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.061
I'm not going to make
a fool out of myself.

08:16.062 --> 08:17.062
I can handle this with dignity.

08:17.063 --> 08:18.563
You're leaving.

08:18.564 --> 08:20.065
I will survive.

08:20.066 --> 08:22.067
Oh, Gloria,
please don't leave me.

08:22.068 --> 08:23.068
I love you. Please.

08:23.069 --> 08:24.569
I can't live without you.

08:24.570 --> 08:26.071
Chester, stop slobbering.

08:26.072 --> 08:27.572
These shoes are suede.

08:27.573 --> 08:30.075
Gloria, what am I going to do?

08:30.076 --> 08:31.576
I left my wife for you.

08:31.577 --> 08:32.577
I left my family.

08:32.578 --> 08:33.578
I have no home.

08:33.578 --> 08:35.080
I have no place to go.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.581
I have nothing, Gloria.

08:36.582 --> 08:37.582
Exactly.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.083
That's why I'm leaving.

08:52.098 --> 08:53.099
Next, please.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.104
Are you nervous?

08:59.105 --> 09:00.105
No.

09:00.106 --> 09:01.106
I am.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.108
So am I.

09:03.109 --> 09:05.110
It's a big step.

09:05.111 --> 09:06.111
Yes, it is.

09:06.112 --> 09:08.113
It shouldn't be
undertaken frivolously.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.614
I agree.

09:09.615 --> 09:10.615
Living together,

09:10.616 --> 09:12.617
sharing a house, a home,
a life together.

09:12.618 --> 09:14.119
It means a lot to me, Danny.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.121
It's not a casual thing.

09:16.122 --> 09:17.122
I agree.

09:17.123 --> 09:18.123
See, my friends,

09:18.124 --> 09:19.124
they live together
two, three weeks,

09:19.125 --> 09:20.125
and it's over.

09:20.126 --> 09:21.626
I can't stand that.

09:21.627 --> 09:22.627
It's childish and irresponsible.

09:22.628 --> 09:25.630
Plus I hate packing.

09:25.631 --> 09:27.132
Polly...

09:27.133 --> 09:29.134
believe me,
this is very important to me.

09:29.135 --> 09:32.637
I'm not going into this lightly.

09:32.638 --> 09:34.139
I love you.

09:38.144 --> 09:39.645
What are you looking at?

09:41.647 --> 09:43.148
Look at this.
They're staring at us.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.650
Oh, they are not.

09:45.651 --> 09:46.651
Excuse me...

09:46.652 --> 09:47.652
All right,

09:47.653 --> 09:48.653
what's your problem,
buddy? Huh?

09:48.654 --> 09:50.155
What's your problem?
Huh?

09:50.156 --> 09:51.156
You don't like, uh,

09:51.157 --> 09:52.157
interracial, uh,
interrelating, huh?

09:52.158 --> 09:53.158
I could care less.

09:53.159 --> 09:54.659
Well, then what
are you gawking at?

09:54.660 --> 09:56.161
I was just going to say hello.

09:56.162 --> 09:58.664
Is that so?
I'm your dentist.

10:10.676 --> 10:12.177
Dr. Stegman.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.178
Dr. Stegman,
I'm really sorry.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.679
I-I-I'm sorry.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.181
I didn't recognize you
without your smock.

10:16.182 --> 10:18.183
It's perfectly all right.
Perfectly all right.

10:18.184 --> 10:19.684
You've got a check-up
in two weeks.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.186
Goodbye.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.687
Do you believe this?

10:22.688 --> 10:24.189
I just roughed up my dentist.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.690
Am I crazy?

10:25.691 --> 10:26.691
Excuse me.

10:26.692 --> 10:28.193
He'll probably clean my teeth

10:28.194 --> 10:30.195
with a saw.

10:30.196 --> 10:31.196
Yoo-hoo.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.698
Uh, Rosen.
Real estate?

10:33.699 --> 10:35.200
Sorry about the wait.
You're next.

10:35.201 --> 10:36.701
Thank you.

10:36.702 --> 10:37.702
I'm sorry, young fellow,

10:37.703 --> 10:39.704
but I think this lady
was ahead of you.

10:39.705 --> 10:41.206
Oh, no, you don't understand...
No, there's no rush.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.208
There's no rush.
There's plenty houses.

10:43.209 --> 10:44.709
All kinds houses.

10:44.710 --> 10:46.211
Houses, houses, houses.

10:46.212 --> 10:48.213
Rosen has hundreds of houses.

10:48.214 --> 10:49.714
No rush.

10:49.715 --> 10:50.715
See, we're together.

10:50.716 --> 10:51.716
I haven't got a thing.

10:51.717 --> 10:52.717
Hey, hey, hey.

10:52.718 --> 10:53.718
No, joking, joking.
Just a humor.

10:53.719 --> 10:55.220
Please, sit down.
I got plenty.

10:55.221 --> 10:56.221
Sit down.

10:56.222 --> 10:57.222
Crazy kids.

10:57.223 --> 10:59.724
Crazy, crazy, crazy.

10:59.725 --> 11:02.727
What are you, crazy?

11:02.728 --> 11:04.229
What do you mean?

11:04.230 --> 11:05.730
What do I mean?

11:05.731 --> 11:06.731
Look how you look.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.233
White. Black.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.734
Where do you expect to live?

11:09.735 --> 11:11.736
In the land of Nod
and Oz and Disney World?

11:11.737 --> 11:13.238
It's crazy, crazy.

11:13.239 --> 11:14.239
All right, all right, fine.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.240
Danny, we don't need this.

11:15.241 --> 11:16.241
We'll go someplace else.

11:16.242 --> 11:17.242
Wait. Listen, please.

11:17.243 --> 11:18.743
Please, sit down, sir.

11:18.744 --> 11:19.744
Please.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.746
I happen to have
the same situation.

11:21.747 --> 11:23.748
My daughter is married
to a black fellow.

11:23.749 --> 11:25.250
Nice man.

11:25.251 --> 11:26.251
Tall.

11:26.252 --> 11:27.252
But they have problems.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.254
People like them have problems.

11:29.255 --> 11:30.755
It's a social fact.

11:30.756 --> 11:34.259
You should see where they live,
and I sold them the house.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.261
What do you recommend?

11:36.262 --> 11:38.763
I recommend you find yourself
a nice black fellow,

11:38.764 --> 11:42.267
and you find yourself
a nice Jewish girl.

11:44.270 --> 11:45.770
I'm not Jewish.

11:45.771 --> 11:48.273
You won't regret it.

11:48.274 --> 11:49.774
Look, Mr. Rosen,

11:49.775 --> 11:51.776
we're in love,

11:51.777 --> 11:53.278
and we feel that we can deal

11:53.279 --> 11:55.280
with anything
that's out there, together.

11:55.281 --> 11:56.781
Now, either you can help us,

11:56.782 --> 11:58.283
or we'll find someone else.

11:58.284 --> 11:59.284
All right, all right.

11:59.285 --> 12:01.786
I was just trying to give you
the facts of life.

12:01.787 --> 12:03.788
I mean, people
are going to harass you

12:03.789 --> 12:05.290
no matter where you live.

12:05.291 --> 12:08.293
Maybe not everybody,
but enough to make it painful.

12:08.294 --> 12:09.794
End of lecture.

12:09.795 --> 12:12.297
Now, I just happen to have

12:12.298 --> 12:15.801
a nice little Cape Cod cottage.

12:17.303 --> 12:19.304
Oh, Danny, it's adorable.

12:19.305 --> 12:20.805
It's just what I wanted.

12:20.806 --> 12:21.806
Who wouldn't?

12:21.807 --> 12:23.308
We'll take it.

12:23.309 --> 12:24.809
You got it.

12:26.812 --> 12:28.313
But I got to warn you,
young lady,

12:28.314 --> 12:31.316
there's not one
black family around for blocks.

12:31.317 --> 12:32.317
So now they'll have

12:32.318 --> 12:33.818
a reason to come over.

12:33.819 --> 12:34.819
It could be tense.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.321
Oh, it'll always be tense

12:36.322 --> 12:37.322
anywhere we go,

12:37.323 --> 12:39.824
but this is our house.

12:39.825 --> 12:42.827
I feel it in my heart.

12:42.828 --> 12:46.331
When the heart speaks,
the mind turns to peanut butter.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.834
Mr. Rosen, may I
ask you a question?

12:49.835 --> 12:51.336
Why not?

12:51.337 --> 12:52.837
How did you deal
with your daughter

12:52.838 --> 12:55.340
in love with a black man?

12:55.341 --> 12:59.345
At first, I was so upset,
I fasted for six hours.

13:00.846 --> 13:03.848
Then I said to myself,
"You're Jewish.

13:03.849 --> 13:06.851
There are people who are
not so crazy about you either."

13:06.852 --> 13:09.354
And I realized hating
was a disease,

13:09.355 --> 13:11.856
and I was not going to be
a carrier.

13:11.857 --> 13:12.857
How's your daughter doing?

13:12.858 --> 13:13.858
Oh, great. Fine.

13:13.859 --> 13:14.859
They're in love.

13:14.860 --> 13:16.361
What do they know?

13:16.362 --> 13:17.862
That's wonderful.

13:17.863 --> 13:21.366
My wife, however,
was committed three years ago.

13:38.384 --> 13:40.385
Morning, Dutch.

13:40.386 --> 13:41.886
Morning, Corinne.

13:41.887 --> 13:43.388
BOTH: Oh!

13:43.389 --> 13:45.390
Oh, no.
Oh, God.

13:45.391 --> 13:46.391
We didn't.
We did.

13:46.392 --> 13:47.392
We did?

13:47.393 --> 13:48.393
You forgot?

13:48.394 --> 13:49.894
No, I know we did.

13:49.895 --> 13:51.396
Oh, jeez.

13:51.397 --> 13:52.897
What kind of people are we?

13:52.898 --> 13:53.898
The worst.

13:53.899 --> 13:55.400
We're the worst.

13:55.401 --> 13:57.903
You must think I'm a real slut.

14:00.906 --> 14:02.407
I'm a terrible person.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.409
I feel like the worst
person in the world.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.411
Guilt is terrible.

14:06.412 --> 14:07.412
That's just it.

14:07.413 --> 14:08.413
I don't feel guilty.

14:09.415 --> 14:10.915
That's why I feel so terrible.

14:10.916 --> 14:12.417
If I could feel guilty about it,

14:12.418 --> 14:13.918
I wouldn't feel so bad,
but I don't.

14:13.919 --> 14:16.421
I feel pretty good, actually.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.424
You were so soft.

14:22.428 --> 14:24.429
I was?

14:24.430 --> 14:25.930
Like a muffin.

14:25.931 --> 14:27.932
Oh.

14:27.933 --> 14:29.934
I'm sorry about this, Corinne.

14:29.935 --> 14:31.936
It's just that...
we were so...

14:31.937 --> 14:32.937
I mean, I was so...

14:32.938 --> 14:33.938
Uh, lost?

14:33.939 --> 14:34.939
Yeah.

14:34.940 --> 14:35.940
And alone.

14:35.941 --> 14:37.442
Yeah.

14:37.443 --> 14:38.443
Me too.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.445
How could I do this to Eunice?

14:40.446 --> 14:43.448
Look around you, Dutch.

14:43.449 --> 14:44.949
What do you see?

14:44.950 --> 14:46.451
What do you mean?

14:46.452 --> 14:47.952
Do you see Eunice?

14:47.953 --> 14:48.953
No.

14:48.954 --> 14:50.955
Who do you see?

14:50.956 --> 14:53.458
You.

14:54.900 --> 14:56.461
I guess when two people
need each other,

14:56.462 --> 14:58.963
sometimes
they happen to find each other.

14:58.964 --> 14:59.964
It happens.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.467
And let's face it,
we needed to find each other.

15:02.468 --> 15:04.469
And we did.

15:04.470 --> 15:05.970
I mean, what's so terrible?

15:05.971 --> 15:07.972
Who did we hurt?

15:07.973 --> 15:11.476
All we did was share
some connubials.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.978
That's true.

15:13.979 --> 15:15.480
I feel terrible.

15:15.481 --> 15:16.981
My lover's sister.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.983
My sister's lover.

15:18.984 --> 15:21.486
I made love
to my lover's sister.

15:21.487 --> 15:24.990
You are the lover
of two sisters.

15:28.494 --> 15:30.995
You're one of the sisters
I love.

15:30.996 --> 15:33.498
You do?

15:33.499 --> 15:34.499
Good morning, Corinne.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.001
I just fed the ba...

15:39.505 --> 15:41.005
Hi, Ma.

15:41.006 --> 15:43.508
Hi, Ma.

15:43.509 --> 15:46.511
I never saw anything.

15:46.512 --> 15:47.512
Not a thing.

15:47.513 --> 15:49.013
I never even came in.

15:49.014 --> 15:50.515
Nope. Not me.

15:50.516 --> 15:51.516
Saw nothing.

15:51.517 --> 15:53.017
Heard nothing.

15:53.018 --> 15:54.519
I'm not even at home right now.

15:54.520 --> 15:56.021
I went out.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.023
Zero.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.024
Nothing.

16:00.025 --> 16:02.527
My eyes are sealed.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.529
Corinne... Oh...

16:04.530 --> 16:07.031
If you should go out later,

16:07.032 --> 16:10.535
would you pick up
a quart of milk, please?

16:10.536 --> 16:12.538
Goodbye.

16:33.058 --> 16:34.058
Hi.

16:34.059 --> 16:35.059
Hi.

16:35.060 --> 16:37.562
You've got some
very strange people

16:37.563 --> 16:39.564
in your waiting room.

16:39.565 --> 16:42.567
Well, they've come
to the right place.

16:42.568 --> 16:45.570
One lady who's dressed in red
insists she's a tomato

16:45.571 --> 16:48.574
and that men keep trying
to squeeze her.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.576
And then there's
some man who says

16:51.577 --> 16:53.077
that there are bugs
all over the place,

16:53.078 --> 16:56.080
and this other lady says
that they're tomato bugs

16:56.081 --> 16:57.582
brought in by the first lady,

16:57.583 --> 17:00.585
which made the first lady
very mad,

17:00.586 --> 17:03.088
because she says
she's been sprayed.

17:05.089 --> 17:07.090
I felt very funny sitting there.

17:07.092 --> 17:08.593
Jessica, you shouldn't.

17:08.594 --> 17:10.595
They're people,
just like anyone else.

17:10.596 --> 17:11.596
Oh, no, I didn't mean that.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.097
It's just that I didn't have

17:13.098 --> 17:15.098
anything to contribute
to the conversation.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.101
I didn't want them
to think I was rude.

17:17.102 --> 17:18.603
Although, I did say

17:18.604 --> 17:21.105
that I thought the tomato
was the most important part

17:21.106 --> 17:23.608
of the bacon, lettuce
and tomato sandwich,

17:23.608 --> 17:27.613
which is not exactly true
because I think the bacon is.

17:29.615 --> 17:30.615
I just hope

17:30.616 --> 17:32.617
that they didn't know
that I was lying.

17:32.618 --> 17:35.119
Jessica, you don't have to
worry about that anymore.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.121
You will not be
seeing these people again.

17:37.122 --> 17:39.123
You are not coming here again.

17:39.124 --> 17:41.626
You're firing me?

17:41.627 --> 17:43.628
No, no.

17:43.629 --> 17:44.629
I know. I know.

17:44.630 --> 17:45.630
I'm hopeless.

17:45.631 --> 17:46.631
It's a hopeless case.

17:46.632 --> 17:48.633
Jessica, no, no.
Well, why not?

17:48.634 --> 17:49.634
It's hereditary.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.636
I mean, do you know
that my great aunt

17:51.637 --> 17:56.641
was personally responsible
for Freud's cocaine habit?

17:56.642 --> 17:58.643
Jessica, you're fine.

17:58.644 --> 18:00.645
That's why you don't have to
come here anymore.

18:00.646 --> 18:02.146
There's nothing wrong with you.

18:02.147 --> 18:03.147
Really?

18:03.148 --> 18:04.148
Really.

18:04.149 --> 18:05.650
Now, I've thought about this
a lot.

18:05.651 --> 18:06.651
I've had to,

18:06.652 --> 18:09.153
because of what's involved.

18:09.154 --> 18:10.655
What's involved?

18:10.656 --> 18:12.156
I'd like to go out with you.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.659
Oh, no,
you'd make me too nervous.

18:14.660 --> 18:16.160
How would I make you nervous?

18:16.161 --> 18:19.163
You're a psychiatrist,
and you know everything.

18:19.164 --> 18:22.166
I mean, if I wanted to kiss you,
you'd know,

18:22.167 --> 18:27.672
and if I wanted to... you know,
you'd know.

18:27.673 --> 18:29.173
I mean, you're a psychiatrist.

18:29.174 --> 18:30.675
You can read minds.

18:30.676 --> 18:32.176
I can't read minds, Jessica.

18:32.177 --> 18:33.678
If I could read minds,

18:33.679 --> 18:35.680
I wouldn't have been so nervous
asking you out.

18:35.681 --> 18:37.181
You were nervous?

18:37.182 --> 18:38.182
A wreck.

18:38.183 --> 18:41.185
Psychiatrists can get nervous?

18:41.186 --> 18:43.187
Jessica, we're people too.

18:43.188 --> 18:45.690
I didn't know that.

18:45.691 --> 18:47.191
What I mean is,

18:47.192 --> 18:49.193
I didn't know
you could get nervous.

18:49.194 --> 18:50.695
I mean, of course
I know you're people.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.196
I can see that.

18:52.197 --> 18:54.199
Two arms, two legs,
a turtleneck.

18:56.702 --> 18:57.702
Jessica...

18:57.703 --> 18:58.703
What?

18:58.704 --> 18:59.704
Will you?

18:59.705 --> 19:00.705
Will I what?

19:00.706 --> 19:02.708
Go out with me.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.224
I think Wendy's up.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.234
Hi.

19:30.235 --> 19:31.235
Hi-ho, little feller.

19:31.236 --> 19:32.237
What can I do for you?

19:37.242 --> 19:38.242
I'm Jodie Dallas.

19:38.243 --> 19:40.244
No kidding.

19:40.245 --> 19:42.747
Sure as shooting.

19:42.748 --> 19:45.249
Somehow, I expected
someone a little, uh...

19:45.250 --> 19:46.250
weirder.

19:46.251 --> 19:47.752
Oh, I am a little weirder.

19:47.753 --> 19:48.753
May I come in?

19:48.754 --> 19:50.254
Um, sure.

19:50.255 --> 19:51.255
Hell.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.256
Come on in.

19:52.257 --> 19:53.758
Hell, sure.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.259
Carol's just getting the kid up.

19:55.260 --> 19:56.260
Make yourself at home.

19:56.261 --> 19:57.261
You want bourbon?

19:57.262 --> 19:58.262
No thanks. I don't drink.

19:58.263 --> 19:59.764
I ain't surprised.

20:01.266 --> 20:02.767
Hey, you come for the kid?

20:02.768 --> 20:04.769
If you mean my daughter,
yeah, that's why I'm here.

20:04.770 --> 20:07.271
Uh, you don't plan on staying on
a bit, then, is that it?

20:07.272 --> 20:08.773
Don't worry about it,
electric horseman.

20:08.774 --> 20:09.774
I'll be out of here

20:09.775 --> 20:11.776
as fast as you can
lasso a bronc.

20:11.777 --> 20:14.278
She's a good kid.
I like that kid.

20:14.279 --> 20:15.279
Fine.

20:15.280 --> 20:16.280
She likes me too.

20:16.281 --> 20:17.782
I'm real glad. Carol!

20:17.783 --> 20:20.284
Uh, there's only one thing
I can't figure. What's that?

20:20.285 --> 20:22.286
How can you say
that kid's yours?

20:22.287 --> 20:23.287
What?

20:23.288 --> 20:24.789
Well, heck,

20:24.790 --> 20:26.290
they're ain't no fairy
in the world

20:26.291 --> 20:28.292
could sire a colt,
far as I can figure.

20:28.293 --> 20:30.294
That's probably because

20:30.295 --> 20:32.797
you have prairie dust
for brains.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.803
Well, here we are,
all nice and clean,

20:38.804 --> 20:41.305
because Mommy washed you
and powdered you.

20:41.306 --> 20:43.808
Oh, Jodie,
we had a wonderful day.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.811
I'm glad.

20:48.814 --> 20:49.814
Hey, sweetie.

20:49.815 --> 20:51.315
Okay.

20:51.316 --> 20:52.817
Hey, it was real nice
meeting you,

20:52.818 --> 20:56.821
and, uh, Carol,
any time you're in town...

20:56.822 --> 20:58.823
Jodie, I have
something to tell you.

20:58.824 --> 20:59.824
What?

20:59.825 --> 21:02.326
Uh, it isn't easy for me to say.

21:02.327 --> 21:04.328
I'm running a little late,
Carol.

21:04.329 --> 21:05.830
I want the baby.

21:05.831 --> 21:08.332
So long, Carol.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.834
I have a lawyer.
You're gonna need an army.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.335
I'm her mother, Jodie.

21:11.336 --> 21:12.837
Why? Because you
changed her once

21:12.838 --> 21:14.839
and threw a little powder
on her bottom?

21:14.840 --> 21:16.340
Forget about it, Carol.

21:16.341 --> 21:17.341
I raised this child.

21:17.342 --> 21:19.343
I'm the one
who got her through teething

21:19.344 --> 21:20.845
and colic
and crying in the night.

21:20.846 --> 21:22.847
I'm all the family she has.

21:22.848 --> 21:24.348
She stays with me.

21:24.349 --> 21:25.349
Okay, I'm taking you to court.

21:25.350 --> 21:26.851
You don't have a chance!

21:26.852 --> 21:28.853
That's my daughter,
and I want her!

21:28.854 --> 21:30.354
I don't believe this.

21:30.355 --> 21:31.856
You're going to get whupped
in court, boy.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.858
Ain't no judge on Earth
going to give you that baby

21:33.859 --> 21:35.359
knowing what he knows

21:35.360 --> 21:36.861
about the way you carry on.

21:36.862 --> 21:40.865
Why don't you just go
punch a cow?

21:40.866 --> 21:42.366
Why don't I just punch you?

21:42.367 --> 21:43.868
Oh, very sensitive man
you have here, Carol.

21:43.869 --> 21:45.870
He's going to make
a very good witness.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.371
Better than a fag.

21:47.372 --> 21:49.874
I don't think I'd get so snitty
if I were you.

21:49.875 --> 21:50.875
I mean, after all,

21:50.876 --> 21:52.076
we do shop in the same stores.

22:02.888 --> 22:03.889
Hi-dee-ho.
