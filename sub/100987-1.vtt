WEBVTT

01:38.593 --> 01:40.528
Yeah!

01:45.900 --> 01:47.335
Hey, Pa.

01:49.138 --> 01:51.472
- Come on. You can do it.
- Whoa!

01:53.541 --> 01:56.909
Okay, Mike. What you got for me?
Let's see what you done.

01:56.911 --> 01:58.446
Check it out.

02:02.684 --> 02:04.016
What y'all up to
in there?

02:04.018 --> 02:05.952
Reopening
this here theater.

02:05.954 --> 02:08.857
Well, it's about time someone
opened something around here.

02:26.774 --> 02:28.774
Cooper, don't you even
think about it.

02:31.913 --> 02:33.779
- Come on, stop it!
- Hey.

02:33.781 --> 02:35.351
Let him up, now.

02:35.917 --> 02:37.917
I'm just playing.

02:37.919 --> 02:41.454
How about I come in there and do
that to you, huh? Treat him nice.

02:41.456 --> 02:44.624
Hey, Rock!
Stop messing with kids over there.

02:44.626 --> 02:46.459
Help me figure out
this burp in this tranny.

02:46.461 --> 02:48.928
- Hey, baby.
- Hey there, Dawn.

02:48.930 --> 02:50.665
Oh, that looks so good.

02:51.532 --> 02:53.532
What's going on?

02:56.804 --> 02:59.707
Eat this pie
before it gets cold.

03:02.010 --> 03:04.043
You getting to be
quite the man, ain't you?

03:04.045 --> 03:07.713
I just want to get
the shop open, you know.

03:07.715 --> 03:09.017
Here.

03:16.824 --> 03:17.926
You hear that?

03:20.995 --> 03:22.430
What?

03:25.533 --> 03:27.500
The sound of nothing.

03:27.502 --> 03:30.972
Just you, me
and the crickets.

03:37.979 --> 03:39.047
Yes, sir.

04:10.611 --> 04:13.746
Now, you sure there ain't nothing I can do

04:13.748 --> 04:17.584
to persuade you gentlemen
not to take my stereo?

04:20.887 --> 04:21.956
Ma'am.

04:24.025 --> 04:25.891
Yeah...
Yeah, I'm real sorry

04:25.893 --> 04:27.960
about skipping
the payments, boys.

04:27.962 --> 04:30.796
Ever since I hurt my back,
I can't work.

04:30.798 --> 04:32.631
I can't work,
can't make money.

04:32.633 --> 04:35.835
It's all right.
We understand.

04:35.837 --> 04:38.037
Sorry to have to
do this to you.

04:38.039 --> 04:42.142
Uh, y'all sure you don't want a little
something to drink before you leave?

04:42.144 --> 04:44.712
- Little something might be nice.
- All right, take it.

04:47.982 --> 04:49.083
Clint.

04:52.653 --> 04:55.923
What the heck's going on here?
Huh?

04:57.126 --> 04:59.560
You and your buddies
hanging out in my house?

05:00.094 --> 05:03.829
Can't a man visit his
boy when he wants to?

05:03.831 --> 05:05.998
You know Franklin
ain't home this time of day.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.138
What, your mama
ran out of whiskey? Huh?

05:11.839 --> 05:15.710
I don't know what he done told you,
but he don't live here no more.

05:16.611 --> 05:18.077
So y'all better
get to steppin'.

05:18.079 --> 05:20.715
We're from
the Plantation repo.

05:26.355 --> 05:28.656
Oh, for the love
of sweet Jesus, Dale.

05:30.058 --> 05:33.027
Franklin's gonna be devastated when
he can't watch the race on Sunday.

05:35.063 --> 05:36.964
Are you just gonna
fucking sit there?

05:37.999 --> 05:39.100
Huh?

05:40.469 --> 05:43.002
Are you just gonna fucking sit there
and let them take all my stuff?

05:43.004 --> 05:46.105
Well, I-I mean,
it's not really your stuff, now, is it?

05:46.107 --> 05:49.176
I mean, y'all didn't even need to break
the door down or nothing, did you?

05:49.178 --> 05:51.710
He just let you in,
just gave you a drink.

05:51.712 --> 05:54.980
Oh, you just lay down.
You lay down, Dale.

05:54.982 --> 05:57.217
- Yeah, why don't you just shut it?
- Lay down like you always do.

05:57.219 --> 05:59.186
Just shut it!
Just shut it 'fore I make you shut it!

05:59.188 --> 06:01.188
Oh, big man's got his whiskey
talking, huh, Dale?

06:01.190 --> 06:03.223
When they throw me and
your son out on the street,

06:03.225 --> 06:05.893
you're gonna be out there flipping
burgers on the fucking barbecue!

06:14.236 --> 06:15.703
Fuck y'all.

06:18.005 --> 06:20.773
Some of us got work
to get with, so...

06:37.892 --> 06:40.059
Sorry to spoil your fun,

06:40.061 --> 06:42.462
but, uh, this piece of shit's
done paid for.

06:42.464 --> 06:44.730
Want me
to give her a try?

06:44.732 --> 06:48.168
When it comes to stubborn
engines, got a good touch.

06:48.170 --> 06:51.240
Keep doing that, you're gonna flood her.

06:52.840 --> 06:55.774
Fine.
Yeah.

06:57.212 --> 06:58.980
Go on.

07:06.053 --> 07:08.789
Well...

07:09.724 --> 07:10.992
Thank you.

07:12.361 --> 07:16.996
Hey, I'm sorry. It just feels like
everything's being stripped away.

07:16.998 --> 07:19.865
Just pulled away, you know?

07:19.867 --> 07:21.903
And sometimes I...

07:23.070 --> 07:26.674
think how much we got to lose
before we got nothing left.

07:29.244 --> 07:31.946
Maybe I can see if there's
something I can do for y'all.

07:33.482 --> 07:35.748
Boy's into NASCAR, huh?

07:35.750 --> 07:38.220
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, he lives for it.

07:41.088 --> 07:44.224
You just do what you got
to do with the TV, all right?

07:44.226 --> 07:45.958
Don't mess yourself up
on my account.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.828
I won't mess myself up.

07:52.267 --> 07:54.802
Why you being so nice to me?

07:57.306 --> 08:00.209
Let's just say you seem
like a decent person.

08:01.943 --> 08:03.110
You know?

08:05.079 --> 08:06.315
And I don't lay down.

08:15.524 --> 08:16.857
Better get on now.

08:26.067 --> 08:27.969
Well, thank you.

08:30.239 --> 08:32.840
Hey, Clint, come on!
Let's go.

08:38.280 --> 08:40.114
Looks like
you're a little light here.

08:40.948 --> 08:43.881
Well, there's this person.

08:43.884 --> 08:46.952
I was just hoping maybe we
could cut her a break just now.

08:46.954 --> 08:49.023
Maybe talk to Stewart
or something.

08:50.024 --> 08:51.391
"Her"?

08:51.393 --> 08:54.795
So, uh...
this is a woman, huh?

08:55.896 --> 08:58.398
It ain't nothing like that.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.801
Well, sure sounds like
something like that.

09:02.103 --> 09:04.204
Well, you never ask
for too much, so, yeah,

09:04.206 --> 09:08.176
I'll talk to Stewart and get
him to cut this person a break.

09:09.311 --> 09:10.878
If that's what you want.

09:19.288 --> 09:22.622
- Ronny, why don't you hand me one of them.
- There you go.

Getting that carpet all set up?
Cool.

09:46.947 --> 09:49.884
Today is the first day
of a new dawn for all of us.

09:50.885 --> 09:52.287
We'll remember it always.

09:54.021 --> 09:56.891
All right, Mike,
put the cherry on it.

09:58.025 --> 09:59.161
Yes, sir.

10:03.964 --> 10:05.200
Yeah.

10:07.336 --> 10:10.236
They saying we can't fly the
flag from the state capitol.

10:10.238 --> 10:11.373
Yep.

10:13.175 --> 10:18.077
Well, tell the goddamn NAACP
this here's the new capitol.

10:24.985 --> 10:26.288
Looking good, boy.

10:29.023 --> 10:34.296
We're in the midst of an
epidemic right here in Laurens.

10:35.430 --> 10:42.471
More than 150 years of injustice
from the plantations...

10:44.272 --> 10:46.475
to where I stand today.

10:48.343 --> 10:54.014
And I ask y'all
to keep silent no longer

10:54.683 --> 10:57.319
and join me in this fight.

11:02.157 --> 11:07.092
How can we prevent this kind
of thing from happening again?

11:07.094 --> 11:10.296
Well, she could start
by bringing a receipt.

11:10.298 --> 11:15.102
I seen three people ahead of me getting
no-hassle returns just like the ad say.

11:15.437 --> 11:17.404
- Not a receipt in sight.
- Mm-hmm.

11:17.406 --> 11:19.174
Now, how you explain that?

11:19.974 --> 11:22.310
I tell you. They white.

11:23.178 --> 11:26.379
Gina, tell her you didn't mean nothing
by it, and we can all be on our way.

11:26.381 --> 11:28.981
I'm not apologizing
for doing my job.

11:28.983 --> 11:31.186
Can we please clear this up?
We are getting slammed out there.

11:32.354 --> 11:34.287
I ain't even got
an apology yet.

11:34.289 --> 11:37.459
Jesus Christ, Gina.
I had to clock off for this shit.

11:44.064 --> 11:47.968
On behalf of all the cashiers
in the world, I'm...

11:48.470 --> 11:50.070
I'm sorry.

11:51.005 --> 11:52.272
Let me do your return.

11:52.274 --> 11:54.207
- God bless you.
- Mm.

11:54.209 --> 11:56.342
At least one of you's
got some sense.

11:56.344 --> 11:58.180
Y'all go ahead
and clock back in now.

11:58.780 --> 12:03.351
Now, I hope you don't think that
giving her a refund is gonna fix this.

12:04.118 --> 12:05.287
Gina, hang back.

12:08.055 --> 12:09.191
Well...

12:10.725 --> 12:15.328
I know you're not talking
about firing me because of this nonsense.

12:15.330 --> 12:18.231
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

12:18.233 --> 12:21.601
I could hear it now. "The black man
gets the poor white girl fired."

12:21.603 --> 12:24.337
Reverend, why don't you just
tell me what it is you'd like me to do.

12:24.339 --> 12:27.273
Like you to teach your staff
to stop seeing color.

12:27.275 --> 12:30.343

Scrumptious meal, Rami. Catch you later.

13:22.297 --> 13:25.567
Hey, Reverend.
See you at the opening.

13:26.868 --> 13:29.604
I'm expecting you
to be the first customer.

13:55.597 --> 13:58.431
- Want some more?
- I'm good, Ma.

14:01.169 --> 14:03.736
- You won't believe...
- I heard. Been getting calls.

14:03.738 --> 14:05.705
- I spoke to the Mayor.
- Mm-hmm.

14:05.707 --> 14:07.473
- To Councilman Edwards.
- Mm-hmm.

14:07.475 --> 14:09.275
Called the NAACP.

14:09.277 --> 14:11.311
There ain't no way
that Tom Griffin

14:11.313 --> 14:13.713
is getting a business license
in this town for that.

14:13.715 --> 14:15.481
It's illegal, then.

14:15.483 --> 14:18.618
That old movie theater,
with it... with its...

14:18.620 --> 14:20.486
- ugly history...
- Mm-hmm.

14:20.488 --> 14:23.456
...of segregation,
with its "colored only" sign

14:23.458 --> 14:25.458
on the side, still legible,

14:25.460 --> 14:27.760
cannot be allowed to be
resurrected into an institution

14:27.762 --> 14:31.600
celebrating the terrorizing
of our community.

14:33.168 --> 14:36.103
What he's saying is
that it's not illegal.

14:39.274 --> 14:41.376
Were you excused
from the table?

14:42.644 --> 14:45.380
I know it's been
a crazy, crazy day...

14:46.915 --> 14:49.248
but you missed his big game.

14:49.250 --> 14:51.317
It's all right.
I got it.

14:51.319 --> 14:54.222
- You go ahead, talk to him.
- All right.

15:06.301 --> 15:08.169
You sure
you don't want no company?

15:10.338 --> 15:13.208
Would you mind sitting
with me for a little while?

15:14.709 --> 15:16.745
I'll check on Kelvin
and be right back.

15:29.758 --> 15:33.561
Uh-uh. Here, baby.
Come on.

15:56.584 --> 15:58.351
Y'all must be lost.

15:58.353 --> 16:00.753
Sorry, miss.
We come from the rent-to-own.

16:00.755 --> 16:03.456
We'll have to take
that television back.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.458
But... But, well,
you see, my husband went...

16:05.460 --> 16:08.363
Let me... Let me talk
to him real quick, okay?

16:15.737 --> 16:19.572
Look, man, um, you think we
can let this one slide, man?

16:19.574 --> 16:22.577
I, uh...
I... I just...

16:24.646 --> 16:28.316
Mike? Mike Burden?

16:30.351 --> 16:31.751
You don't remember me
from school, man?

16:31.753 --> 16:33.688
We was kids together, man.

16:34.289 --> 16:35.655
Sure about that?

16:35.657 --> 16:36.856
Yeah.

16:36.858 --> 16:39.761
Uh, Clarence Brooks, man.
I, uh...

16:40.595 --> 16:42.795
I ain't see you
in years, man.

16:42.797 --> 16:44.432
How's your mama?

16:45.300 --> 16:48.301
Hey, Clint,
why don't you go sit in the truck.

16:48.303 --> 16:49.771
I'll handle this one.

16:52.774 --> 16:54.242
Okay.

17:00.782 --> 17:03.718
Yeah, it's been a while.
Things are different now.

17:04.685 --> 17:07.787
My mama ain't been around
for a good long while.

17:07.789 --> 17:09.856
Since I got back from the army,

17:09.858 --> 17:11.790
got myself a job
at the rent-to-own.

17:11.792 --> 17:13.925
About the only thing
I can do around here.

17:13.928 --> 17:17.396
Yeah. Sure, man. I...

17:17.397 --> 17:19.665
I got laid off when they closed
Groggins, man.

17:19.666 --> 17:21.534
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

17:21.536 --> 17:22.902
But I got a job.

17:22.904 --> 17:25.605
Uh, just, you know,
few and far between,

17:25.607 --> 17:27.342
construction and...

17:28.810 --> 17:31.744
You know, I got a check, man. It, uh,
comes the end of the month, and by...

17:31.746 --> 17:34.547
Hey, look, I'm with you,
man, but this is my job.

17:34.549 --> 17:37.585
If I don't do it,
my ass gonna get repo'd.

17:44.425 --> 17:46.626
He said he got a check
coming from the state.

17:46.628 --> 17:49.397
Yeah? Welfare check.

17:49.764 --> 17:52.300
One, two.

17:52.734 --> 17:56.869
These niggers,
always with their goddamn handouts.

17:56.871 --> 17:59.139
So you and him
were buddies, huh?

17:59.141 --> 18:02.343
Said I knew him.
Didn't say I'd eat with him.

18:36.744 --> 18:38.945
There is no fear in love,

18:38.947 --> 18:42.882
but perfect love
casteth out fear.

18:42.884 --> 18:45.751
Because fear cannot exist

18:45.753 --> 18:48.988
in the same universe
of our hearts.

18:50.892 --> 18:53.025
These forces are at war
with one another...

18:53.027 --> 18:54.861
- Mm-hmm.
- That's right.

18:54.863 --> 18:59.601
...and the weapons that we use
to fight fear...

19:00.501 --> 19:02.568
- They're not revenge.
- No.

19:02.570 --> 19:04.503
They're not hate!

19:04.505 --> 19:05.838
- Right.
- That's right.

19:05.840 --> 19:10.676
They are and will
always be... love.

19:12.513 --> 19:13.913
Can I get a "hallelujah"
up there?

19:13.915 --> 19:15.982
Hallelujah!

19:15.984 --> 19:18.551
- Perfect love drives out fear.
- Yes.

19:18.553 --> 19:21.221
- Reminds fear that it doesn't belong here.
- That's right.

19:21.223 --> 19:24.690
- Tells fear that it's time to move on and go away.
- Go, sin! Go!

19:24.692 --> 19:26.592
Go somewhere else.

19:26.594 --> 19:28.060
- Get out, fear!
- Use him, Lord.

19:28.062 --> 19:29.929
Go away, fear!

19:29.931 --> 19:31.030
Hallelujah up there.

19:31.032 --> 19:32.798
Hallelujah.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.402
Hallelujah up there.

19:41.243 --> 19:42.610
Come on, Ray,
get a little closer.

19:45.680 --> 19:46.848
Hey!

19:47.949 --> 19:49.582
- Yeah!
- Oh!

19:55.823 --> 19:57.490
Oh!

20:07.568 --> 20:09.068
Look familiar?

20:11.105 --> 20:13.906
Damn it, lard-ass. Quit horsing
around, get them racks finished up.

20:13.908 --> 20:15.944
I tell you,
we're gonna make a fortune.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.845
Fifty bucks each.

20:22.617 --> 20:23.885
Look what I found.

20:28.290 --> 20:29.989
- That's amazing.
- What is it?

20:29.991 --> 20:33.592
Well, it says right here.
Uh, "To Tom and Mike.

20:33.594 --> 20:36.028
From the man who first
came up with the KKK

20:36.030 --> 20:39.865
to the men who came up
with the first KKK museum.

20:39.867 --> 20:43.303
- Good luck, Horace King."
- Horace King.

20:46.741 --> 20:47.875
Well, look at that.

20:50.912 --> 20:52.878
Okay, Mike, take it away.

20:52.880 --> 20:55.148
- Put it somewhere special.
- Yes, sir.

20:58.119 --> 20:59.952
That's hot. That's hot.

20:59.954 --> 21:02.088
The timing belt
does exactly, but I know...

21:02.090 --> 21:03.624
- Adjusts the carb.
- Yeah.

21:17.939 --> 21:20.006
Looks like
that carburetor there.

21:20.008 --> 21:21.774
- Yup.
- Says 101.

21:21.776 --> 21:24.810
- Does it? 101?
- Yeah. You see it?

21:24.812 --> 21:27.882
And then the red,
black and green says...

21:28.350 --> 21:29.915
a hundred.

21:29.917 --> 21:31.853
You're so funny.

21:36.724 --> 21:38.026
Evening, ma'am.

21:40.762 --> 21:42.195
Hi. Hey.

21:42.197 --> 21:46.601
Saw you come up.
Figure I'd come over and say hey.

21:47.969 --> 21:50.905
Yeah.
Well, I'm glad you did.

21:51.973 --> 21:53.708
I, uh...

21:55.177 --> 21:58.644
Well, you know, I didn't want
to cause any problems for you,

21:58.646 --> 22:00.713
stopping by
the rent-to-own,

22:00.715 --> 22:02.215
but I wanted to say thank you

22:02.217 --> 22:04.184
for what you done
the other night.

22:04.186 --> 22:06.554
It was no big deal.

22:07.088 --> 22:11.592
Well, uh,
maybe I can return the favor.

22:14.729 --> 22:16.129
Hey, y'all, uh...

22:16.131 --> 22:18.398
want to come on down
to the pits with the guys?

22:18.400 --> 22:19.865
- Yeah. That'd be so cool.
- Oh, yeah.

22:19.867 --> 22:21.168
- Can we, Ma?
- We can.

22:21.170 --> 22:22.235
You like that?

22:22.237 --> 22:23.638
That's kind of you.

22:24.705 --> 22:26.005
Come on, little man.

22:27.075 --> 22:28.774
Thank you.

22:28.776 --> 22:31.043
- Can we cross here?
- You're with me, you can.

22:31.045 --> 22:33.180
It's not dangerous
or nothing?

22:33.182 --> 22:35.014
Only if you eat
the hot dogs.

22:35.016 --> 22:38.153
This is the
coolest thing I've ever seen!

22:39.120 --> 22:41.421
- Who's that woman?
- That's her.

22:41.423 --> 22:44.592
That's the girl Mike put up for
the other day at the job.

22:46.994 --> 22:50.096
- This here's Tom, Clint, Ronny.
- Hey.

22:50.098 --> 22:51.831
Got a name?

22:51.833 --> 22:53.699
Franklin.

22:53.701 --> 22:55.170
Franklin,
these are the boys.

22:56.405 --> 22:59.206
- Make yourself at home. Want a beer?
- No.

22:59.208 --> 23:01.807
Come with me.

23:01.809 --> 23:03.776
<i>Here comes Tom
Griffin's own car number four!</i>

Wow, you actually

23:31.772 --> 23:33.941
Well, yeah.
Living on the edge.

23:34.742 --> 23:37.678
Hey, little hoss,
why don't you come on down here with me.

23:39.780 --> 23:40.982
You too, mama.

23:45.820 --> 23:47.052

Put this here on.

23:58.233 --> 24:00.167
Went for those dogs, too, huh?

24:00.169 --> 24:02.036
Brave.

24:19.787 --> 24:21.987
- You want to drive this thing?
- Yup.

24:29.198 --> 24:30.297
Why don't you
give her a spin.

24:30.299 --> 24:31.799
Okay.

24:36.171 --> 24:39.840

24:40.275 --> 24:42.843
- Now you get ready for bed.
- You're welcome.

24:45.813 --> 24:48.080
All right
there, little Speed Racer.

24:48.082 --> 24:49.949
Why don't you
motor on in, huh?

24:51.819 --> 24:53.222
I'll be in in a minute.

24:56.258 --> 24:57.892
Well...

25:00.061 --> 25:01.263
Well...

25:02.130 --> 25:04.166
I can't thank you enough
for tonight.

25:05.200 --> 25:11.304
You know, seeing him like that with
all your friends and the race and all.

25:11.306 --> 25:16.811
Well, thank you. That was... You have
no idea how much that means to him.

25:20.081 --> 25:21.880
Look, I had fun.

25:21.882 --> 25:23.283
You did?

25:23.285 --> 25:24.819
Yeah.

25:27.088 --> 25:28.190
Well...

25:30.891 --> 25:32.160
Good night.

25:33.128 --> 25:34.263
Good night.

25:35.297 --> 25:39.132
Oh, hey.
Sweatshirt.

25:39.134 --> 25:41.370
- Oh, you can hold on to it.
- No. It's all right.

26:18.373 --> 26:21.008
I don't know. One of us
had to do something.

26:41.663 --> 26:44.397
They got the Martin
Luther King museum.

26:44.399 --> 26:47.334
They got the Jew museum.

26:47.336 --> 26:52.037
Hell, they got Armenian museums
and the Native American museums

26:52.039 --> 26:57.976
and Hispanical cultural centers
right here on American soil.

26:57.978 --> 27:01.080
- That's right.
- And here we are,

27:01.082 --> 27:04.250
the chosen people
of God and Jesus,

27:04.252 --> 27:07.320
fighting for the right
to celebrate the white man.

27:07.322 --> 27:09.422
Yeah!

27:09.424 --> 27:13.159
We're gonna fight for God's
will for racial purity,

27:13.161 --> 27:15.161
to keep our families safe

27:15.163 --> 27:17.930
- from dark-skinned murderers and rapists.
- Yeah.

27:17.932 --> 27:20.333
- Keep our blood pure.
- Amen!

27:20.335 --> 27:24.404
We're gonna fight for the Klan
museum with God on our side.

27:24.406 --> 27:26.139
- Yes!
- Amen!

27:26.141 --> 27:28.006
- And fire in our souls.
- Yes, sir!

27:28.008 --> 27:30.410
And we are gonna do
whatever it takes

27:30.412 --> 27:33.346
for the cause of justice
for the white man.

27:33.348 --> 27:36.184
- Right on!
- That's right!

27:37.985 --> 27:39.287
Turn.

27:43.090 --> 27:44.459
To God!

27:45.160 --> 27:47.059
To country!

27:47.061 --> 27:48.363
To Klan!

28:29.304 --> 28:33.206
We will remember Saint Paul Methodist.

28:33.208 --> 28:35.243
Yes, we will.
We will remember.

28:39.147 --> 28:40.547
Mount Zion.

28:40.549 --> 28:43.385
Yes.

28:45.353 --> 28:47.085
Countsville African.

28:47.087 --> 28:49.491
Yeah.

28:50.358 --> 28:52.492
And Century United.

28:52.494 --> 28:55.628
Yes, sir.

28:55.630 --> 28:58.198
Remember them?

28:58.200 --> 29:00.034
- Remember them?
- Yes, sir.

29:00.502 --> 29:02.535
And we must make sure
it never happens again.

29:02.537 --> 29:05.238
Hallelujah.

29:05.240 --> 29:07.807
- Hallelujah.
- In Jesus' name.

29:07.809 --> 29:09.444
The church bombings.

29:11.780 --> 29:14.647
Killing
of innocent children.

29:17.319 --> 29:21.121
But in the midst
of it all...

29:22.357 --> 29:26.826
- Jesus Christ said, "Love thy enemies."
- Yes, he did.

29:26.828 --> 29:32.398
But when it's time to fight, we will fight!

29:32.400 --> 29:34.400
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, we will. Yes, we will.

29:34.402 --> 29:36.402
Yes, we will, now.

29:36.404 --> 29:38.271
Come on, everybody, now.

29:38.273 --> 29:41.140
- Jesus Christ said, "Rebuke evil."
- Yes, sir!

29:41.142 --> 29:44.177
And the Redneck Shop is evil.

29:44.179 --> 29:46.412
- In the name of the Lord.
- Come on!

29:48.383 --> 29:51.284
They may set crosses burning
in the middle of the night,

29:51.286 --> 29:55.555
but we will fill the night
with a different kind of fire.

29:55.557 --> 29:58.858
- Yeah!
- The fire of love.

30:00.862 --> 30:03.596
And it's gonna take all the love
in our hearts tomorrow, y'all.

30:03.598 --> 30:07.300

32:26.408 --> 32:27.707

You're gonna respect the flag.

Doesn't it make you sick?

32:51.266 --> 32:54.667
Don't you want
that white American dream

32:54.669 --> 32:56.803
that they're taking away

32:56.805 --> 32:59.572
Now, I can't hear you.

32:59.574 --> 33:01.274
- Yeah!
- Sure do, sir.

33:01.276 --> 33:03.376
Not "yeah." Yes!

33:03.378 --> 33:05.578
- Yes!
- All right. Very good.

33:05.580 --> 33:07.615
Now, I... I need to make
an announcement.

33:08.049 --> 33:09.615
Y'all know
that this day has been

33:09.617 --> 33:12.188
a dream of mine
for a long time.

33:12.620 --> 33:14.587
But this dream
would have been impossible

33:14.589 --> 33:18.458
without a special person's
loyalty, hard work and vision.

33:18.460 --> 33:20.626
And I believe
that in this life,

33:20.628 --> 33:23.298
you reap the reward
of hard work.

33:23.765 --> 33:28.634
I'd like to announce
that I am gonna give the deed

33:28.636 --> 33:32.507
to this here building
to Mike Burden.

33:34.642 --> 33:38.377
Go on. Take it.

33:38.379 --> 33:41.581
That deed gives me a
lifelong lease on this shop.

33:41.583 --> 33:44.550
At least I know that
when I'm dead and gone,

33:44.552 --> 33:46.387
our legacy will continue.

33:48.757 --> 33:50.656
Mike Burden.

33:50.658 --> 33:52.759
- Yeah!
- Let's go, Mike.

33:52.761 --> 33:54.794
- White pride!
- White pride!

33:58.600 --> 34:00.401
White pride, yeah!

34:22.123 --> 34:24.956
Hey.

34:24.958 --> 34:26.694
How's it going on
with you?

34:28.396 --> 34:29.764
Just excited to see you
is all.

34:31.632 --> 34:34.668
Hey, uh...
you want to get a beer?

34:36.704 --> 34:37.772
Or coffee?

34:39.440 --> 34:40.572
Or water?

34:42.409 --> 34:43.810
You know...

34:43.812 --> 34:45.878
Franklin's, uh,
at his friend's,

34:45.880 --> 34:48.716
and I'm watching them both
tonight, so I can't, but, uh...

34:50.585 --> 34:51.853
you can give me a ride
if you want.

34:53.420 --> 34:54.589
Come on.

34:57.792 --> 34:59.394
It's just right here.

35:01.396 --> 35:03.496
Whose kid is Franklin
playing with, anyway?

35:03.498 --> 35:05.333
Clarence Brooks' boy.

35:05.733 --> 35:07.466
- Clarence?
- Yeah.

35:07.468 --> 35:08.968
I told you
I wasn't gonna spray you.

35:08.970 --> 35:10.803
Like that.

35:10.805 --> 35:12.672
Duane
is Frankie's best friend.

35:12.674 --> 35:14.876
We've been doing this
ever since they was little.

35:17.478 --> 35:18.580
Hey.

35:19.881 --> 35:21.683
I'll call you later.

35:34.163 --> 35:35.763
Hey.

35:37.199 --> 35:39.534
How are you?
Yeah.

35:47.575 --> 35:48.941
What you doing with him?

35:48.943 --> 35:50.511
Oh, you know, just...

35:51.579 --> 35:53.915
spend some time. Why?

35:55.016 --> 35:57.617
Hey, Toosie,
bring me a towel.

35:57.619 --> 36:00.786
I know Mike Burden. Uh,
we used to hang out just like these two.

36:00.788 --> 36:03.623
- Yeah?
- Yeah, a long, long time ago.

36:03.625 --> 36:05.760
But things are different
now, you know.

36:06.594 --> 36:08.494
Why's that?

36:10.632 --> 36:13.468
Klansmen don't play
with no black man.

36:21.609 --> 36:23.809
Oh, man,
I'm sweating my balls off.

36:23.811 --> 36:25.745
- I'm sweating?
- A little bit.

36:25.747 --> 36:27.680
The food's spicy.

36:27.682 --> 36:29.882
- It's got a little kick to it.
- A little kick to it, huh?

36:29.884 --> 36:31.951
Hey, it stings going in,
it's gonna sting going out.

36:36.724 --> 36:39.725
It's good, though.

36:39.727 --> 36:40.993
Can't believe
we haven't been here.

36:40.995 --> 36:42.595
Oh.

36:42.597 --> 36:44.264
Well, it's right next door.

36:44.266 --> 36:46.065
Tom and I...
we were thinking, "What the hell?"

36:46.067 --> 36:48.567
- Now we come back here all the time.
- Yeah.

36:48.569 --> 36:50.770
Most folks are scared
on account of Rami looks like

36:50.772 --> 36:53.041
a-a mongrel, you know,
a half-breed.

36:53.775 --> 36:55.777
He ain't.
He's a full-blooded Indian guy.

36:58.579 --> 37:00.046
Speak of the devil.

37:00.048 --> 37:02.848
Ah, Mr. Tom,
how is everything tonight?

37:02.850 --> 37:04.750
Couldn't be better,
my man.

37:04.752 --> 37:06.719
You sure there ain't
no dog in this?

37:06.721 --> 37:09.522
No, my friend.
I think you think of the Chinese.

37:09.524 --> 37:12.593
Oh, you got to be careful of them now. They're sneaky.

37:12.994 --> 37:14.729
Remember that there
Pearl Harbor?

37:15.530 --> 37:17.596
Honey, that's the Japanese.

37:17.598 --> 37:20.733
Remember them Japanese in Pearl Harbor?

37:20.735 --> 37:24.103
Okay. Everyone, enjoy.
Dessert is on my treat.

37:24.105 --> 37:26.641
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

37:27.875 --> 37:31.644
Okay. So, this, um...

37:31.646 --> 37:34.080
A woman goes into a welfare
office to register her dog.

37:34.082 --> 37:36.582
And a woman
behind the counter says,

37:36.584 --> 37:39.885
"You can't register a dog.
Dogs can't apply."

37:39.887 --> 37:42.322
And the woman looks
in her eye and says,

37:42.324 --> 37:44.790
"Why not?
Got all the qualifications.

37:44.792 --> 37:49.762
One, he's black. Two, he don't do
nothing but sit on his butt all day.

37:49.764 --> 37:53.133
And three, he has no idea
who his pa is."

38:08.683 --> 38:11.184
Shoot, Mike,
if I didn't know better,

38:11.186 --> 38:14.787
I'd say that woman
didn't like my sense of humor.

38:14.789 --> 38:15.990
Stop.

38:21.996 --> 38:24.799
Michael, I don't like
that Tom Griffin.

38:28.337 --> 38:31.140
Come on. He was just kidding.
Everybody's laughing.

38:32.106 --> 38:34.006
Do you think it's funny?

38:35.610 --> 38:36.876
Do you?

38:38.613 --> 38:40.548
Tom's like a father to me.

38:41.949 --> 38:43.117
He looks after me.

38:44.018 --> 38:46.719
These people
are like my family.

38:46.721 --> 38:48.756
And they're Klan, right?

38:55.863 --> 38:57.832
My granddaddy was Klan.

38:59.634 --> 39:01.934
All right.
So you know, then.

39:01.936 --> 39:03.172
Yeah, I do know.

39:07.708 --> 39:09.777
I can't, Michael.
I can't.

39:12.713 --> 39:13.981
Hey, listen.

39:21.423 --> 39:22.790
Come here.

39:24.759 --> 39:25.827
Come here.

39:40.775 --> 39:42.610
Yes, you can.

39:50.985 --> 39:52.987
I can't think straight
around you.

39:53.888 --> 39:56.256
<i>♪ Oh, oh... ♪</i>

39:56.258 --> 40:00.893
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

40:00.895 --> 40:03.028
No justice, no peace!

40:03.030 --> 40:07.167
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

40:07.169 --> 40:10.769
<i>I don't see
anything wrong with the Redneck Shop.</i>

40:10.771 --> 40:13.206
<i>If the blacks don't like it,

40:13.208 --> 40:15.074
<i>They can go back to Africa
any day.</i>

40:15.076 --> 40:17.042
We'll take their
redneck asses to the hood.

40:17.044 --> 40:20.045
- Shit, that's our Africa.
- That's right. That's right.

40:20.047 --> 40:22.882
No justice,
no peace! No justice, no peace!

40:22.884 --> 40:24.884
Well, why don't we
just ignore it?

40:24.886 --> 40:29.156
Ignoring the problem just leads
to its growth, like cancer.

40:29.158 --> 40:31.724
You got to attack it
where it starts.

40:31.726 --> 40:36.862
<i>And for the people of
Laurens who must explain why the KKK</i>

40:36.864 --> 40:40.200

40:40.202 --> 40:41.702
Amen.

40:42.204 --> 40:44.036

40:44.038 --> 40:46.306

40:46.308 --> 40:48.807

40:48.809 --> 40:50.809
Fucking niggers.

40:50.811 --> 40:56.048
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

40:56.050 --> 40:58.185
Yeah, I was just
calling for the reverend.

40:58.187 --> 41:01.288
Yeah, I just wanted to, uh,
remind you that you're just a man,

41:01.290 --> 41:04.792
and to my knowledge,
you ain't bulletproof.

41:07.094 --> 41:09.229
You know,
he just outgrew them all.

41:09.231 --> 41:12.132
Let me tally them up,
and I'll let you know.

41:12.134 --> 41:13.266
- All right.
- Okay.

41:13.268 --> 41:14.936
Hey.

41:16.103 --> 41:17.905
What do you think of this?

41:18.839 --> 41:21.106
Oh, my sweet Lord.

41:21.108 --> 41:23.143
What are
we gonna do with that?

41:23.145 --> 41:24.977
What, Franklin don't fish?

41:24.979 --> 41:26.948
Shit, when I was his age...

41:28.250 --> 41:31.018
I'd go fishing all the time
for catfish.

41:31.819 --> 41:34.053
My grandpa used to
take me out and he'd say,

41:34.055 --> 41:36.121
"Look, if you could
sit on a boat all day

41:36.123 --> 41:38.225
and not catch a bite,
you're gonna grow some patience."

41:38.227 --> 41:40.128
Maybe he needs some of that.

41:41.263 --> 41:43.131
What do you think
of this one here?

41:43.864 --> 41:46.000
- Who, you?
- No.

41:46.968 --> 41:48.168
- What do you think of it?
- For me?

41:48.170 --> 41:50.938
Uh-huh.

41:53.808 --> 41:54.976
I don't know.

41:58.913 --> 42:00.014
You like it?

42:01.015 --> 42:02.351
Yeah, I like it.

42:04.286 --> 42:06.355
I'll get it.

42:09.191 --> 42:11.890
- I'll get more than that.
- Mm-hmm.

42:16.964 --> 42:18.897
$9.78 for all that.

42:18.899 --> 42:21.902
Spent, like,
ten times that when I bought it.

42:23.138 --> 42:25.438
I'll get him something
from the shop.

42:25.440 --> 42:27.340
There's all kind of stuff
for him over there.

42:27.342 --> 42:30.178
Uh, I don't know.

42:34.283 --> 42:36.817
You really want to take
Franklin fishing, huh?

42:37.419 --> 42:39.286
Yeah.

42:39.288 --> 42:40.921
Where y'all go fishing at?

42:41.922 --> 42:43.791
Over there
in Muddy Creek Lane.

42:44.326 --> 42:46.328
We can't go
down there now, though.

42:47.061 --> 42:49.028
Why's that?

42:49.030 --> 42:51.364
'Cause all the niggers done taken
over that neck of the woods.

42:51.366 --> 42:53.366
- Damn it, Michael.
- Oh, come on. I'm a Klansman.

42:53.368 --> 42:55.870
You gonna drive all the blacks
out of Laurens?

42:58.206 --> 42:59.241
I don't know.

43:00.142 --> 43:02.908
Let's say they did all leave.

43:02.910 --> 43:06.281
We'd still be white trash, with no
one to step on to make us feel better.

43:15.956 --> 43:18.191
Yeah, get that re!

43:18.193 --> 43:19.659
Oh, fader.

43:19.661 --> 43:21.894
Oh, all right!
All right!

43:21.896 --> 43:23.131
Let me see that ball.

43:26.067 --> 43:27.966
Hey, Daddy.

43:27.968 --> 43:30.069
- Gonna give it to me?
- Yes, sir.

43:30.071 --> 43:31.970
Okay.

43:31.972 --> 43:35.375
- So you think I ain't got any.
- We gonna be here for a while.

43:35.377 --> 43:37.145
I believe it.

43:37.978 --> 43:39.947
Whoa! I made one!

43:40.449 --> 43:41.849
There you go.

43:42.417 --> 43:45.984
Ain't bad, Daddy.
It ain't bad.

43:45.986 --> 43:48.987
God must be on your side
for you to make that jumper.

43:48.989 --> 43:50.989
I'mma tell you. Hallelujah.

43:50.991 --> 43:52.925
Hey, y'all.
We best be gettin'.

43:52.927 --> 43:56.131
- Good seeing you, Mr. Hen. Yes, sir.
- Okay. Good to see you.

44:02.371 --> 44:06.272
Everybody, keep y'all cool.
Stay calm, y'all.

44:06.274 --> 44:09.942
Hey! Somebody call the zoo!
These boys done got out!

44:09.944 --> 44:12.145
Yeah!

44:12.147 --> 44:14.381
Hey, why don't you come a little closer
with that shit there, punk? What's up?

44:14.383 --> 44:17.015
Hey.

44:17.017 --> 44:18.119
Know your place, boy.

44:21.189 --> 44:22.324
Fucking niggers.

44:27.162 --> 44:30.028
If them fools weren't Klan, we'd be dragging
their white ass through the streets.

44:30.030 --> 44:33.100
- Kel, what's up, man?
- And guess whose black asses would be in jail then.

44:34.169 --> 44:35.936
They got police ties.

44:37.739 --> 44:39.974
Everybody, just relax.
Let's go home.

44:45.547 --> 44:49.047
Okay. Hit the dump quick.
Meet you back at the store.

44:49.049 --> 44:52.585
I'll be getting on.
I was thinking about surprising Judy,

44:52.587 --> 44:55.588
picking her and the kids up
from school.

44:55.590 --> 44:58.458
Well, why don't you
leave them alone for a minute?

44:58.460 --> 45:02.029
I mean, they've been getting back
from school just fine all this time.

45:03.365 --> 45:04.433
Yeah, you're right.

45:07.736 --> 45:09.337
Hey.

45:12.240 --> 45:14.008
I was kind of wondering...

45:16.076 --> 45:18.946
You know, I've always appreciated
having a place to live.

45:20.248 --> 45:23.383
But ain't no place
to raise a family.

45:23.385 --> 45:25.518
Well, I was thinking about
moving on in with Judy.

45:25.520 --> 45:27.322
She's a little back
on the rent.

45:28.890 --> 45:32.294
Well, I was thinking maybe I can help catch
her up, sort it out with the landlord.

45:33.762 --> 45:35.363
Do my part.

45:37.132 --> 45:38.567
Well, look,
I'll tell you what. I'll...

45:39.434 --> 45:42.270
I'll help you square up
the landlord, and, uh...

45:45.072 --> 45:48.310
It'd be, uh, good for you
to be the man around the house.

46:05.059 --> 46:07.059
So, this is you
moving in, huh?

46:09.264 --> 46:10.332
Yeah.

46:22.377 --> 46:24.412
Hey. Who wants to go
catch some dinner?

46:25.413 --> 46:28.149
Oh, my sweet Lord.

46:31.085 --> 46:35.655
Hey. So, you really gonna take
Franklin down to Muddy Creek, huh?

46:35.657 --> 46:39.093
Figure it was high time the boy learns how
to fend for himself in the great outdoors.

46:41.429 --> 46:42.497
Franklin!

46:44.533 --> 46:46.165
All right!

46:46.167 --> 46:48.234
Fish ain't waiting on us,
you know.

46:48.236 --> 46:51.038
Come on, D! The fish
ain't waiting for us, you know!

47:00.181 --> 47:02.584
- You go on, then.
- Come on.

47:11.526 --> 47:14.227
There ain't
snakes in that there water?

47:14.229 --> 47:16.563
There any gators
in that there water?

47:16.565 --> 47:19.465
Now, look,
when we get down here,

47:19.467 --> 47:22.368
you guys keep quiet so you don't
scare the fish away, all right?

47:22.370 --> 47:23.471
Okay.

47:24.906 --> 47:26.508
Don't cross me up there, hoss.

47:33.348 --> 47:34.747
- You got something there?
- Mm-hmm.

47:34.749 --> 47:36.516
Oh, boy!

47:36.518 --> 47:39.552
Reel it in.
Don't horse it. Here. Here.

47:39.554 --> 47:42.689
I caught a fish!

47:42.691 --> 47:44.223
There we go!
There we go!

47:44.225 --> 47:47.295
Come on, Duane.

47:49.731 --> 47:51.700
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey.

47:53.368 --> 47:56.103
You better scrub
those hands off, boy.

47:57.572 --> 48:00.373
What? Why?

48:00.375 --> 48:03.110
Didn't you touch that
black boy out there today?

48:05.680 --> 48:07.780
Oh, you just think this is
some big ol' riot, don't you?

48:07.782 --> 48:10.352
Yes, I do.

48:11.252 --> 48:12.387
Yes, I do.

48:19.761 --> 48:21.761
That one's mine.
That one's mine.

48:21.763 --> 48:24.197
Everybody needs a big ol'
ice cream cone once in a while.

48:24.199 --> 48:25.565
- Which one? This one here?
- This one. Yeah.

48:25.567 --> 48:27.667
<i>♪ I'm falling harder... ♪</i>

48:27.669 --> 48:29.235
Boom. Boom.

48:29.237 --> 48:30.570
Oh!

48:30.572 --> 48:32.672
What's going on over here?

48:32.674 --> 48:34.974
Check this out.

48:34.976 --> 48:36.745
Just my mouth just ain't...

48:38.380 --> 48:41.214
This here ice cream's broken.

48:41.216 --> 48:43.216
- Better let me see mama's.
- I want my ice cream.

48:43.218 --> 48:45.487
- She wants her ice cream.
- Give it back.

48:46.988 --> 48:49.691
- I want that ice cream.
- Scoot down there, hoss.

48:50.492 --> 48:52.992
Feel like I got something on my face.

48:52.994 --> 48:54.694
Feel like
I got something right here.

48:54.696 --> 48:58.264
Gonna make me choke.

48:58.266 --> 49:00.366
Oh, you want to ninja?

49:00.368 --> 49:02.704
You gonna ninja?

49:03.571 --> 49:06.606
- I'm dizzy.
- Mike, they smashed up our fucking shop.

49:06.608 --> 49:08.309
- What?
- Let's fucking go!

49:09.678 --> 49:11.579
- I'll meet you back at yours.
- Hey.

49:13.314 --> 49:14.582
Mike?

49:15.316 --> 49:17.185
Hey! Mike!

49:22.724 --> 49:24.359
Fuckers!

49:25.660 --> 49:28.229
Rami called my dad
soon as he heard the crash.

49:28.763 --> 49:31.566
Police are there,
the whole Channel 6 News team.

49:32.434 --> 49:35.268
They smashed the whole front of the shop.
Motherfuckers!

49:35.270 --> 49:36.736
They catch 'em?

49:36.738 --> 49:40.475
A dead nigger.
Better pray he's in police custody.

49:42.711 --> 49:44.279
Is he slowing down?

49:46.347 --> 49:47.480
He is.

49:47.482 --> 49:49.849
This asshole's
slowing down.

49:54.656 --> 49:56.624
That fucking coon
is mocking us.

49:57.659 --> 49:59.260
Stop.

50:19.380 --> 50:21.382
Come on.

50:27.689 --> 50:29.257
Come on, Clint.

50:53.548 --> 50:55.283
Come on, now, get up.

51:30.585 --> 51:32.752
<i>I think it's better to do this
now than to have to look later</i>

51:32.754 --> 51:34.520
<i>at the face of
an anguished black woman</i>

51:34.522 --> 51:35.855
<i>whose son has been hung
from a tree.</i>

51:35.857 --> 51:37.890
Yeah. Nice how
you closed that shop.

51:37.892 --> 51:39.792
<i>And they're right.</i>

51:39.794 --> 51:41.794
Violence
and the destruction of property

51:41.796 --> 51:43.498
never puts an end to things.

51:44.532 --> 51:45.767
Come on, now.

51:46.668 --> 51:48.935
Think of
the churches burning.

51:48.937 --> 51:51.537
Bible says
an eye for an eye.

51:51.539 --> 51:53.472
That's
Old Testament thinking.

51:53.474 --> 51:55.741
That's not the preachings and
the teachings of Jesus Christ.

51:55.743 --> 51:58.611
You mean that blue-eyed Jesus white
folks got hanging on their walls?

51:58.613 --> 52:00.813
I mean the Jesus
who's your Lord and Savior,

52:00.815 --> 52:03.416
who says love your enemies and
pray for those who persecute you.

52:03.418 --> 52:05.585
Oh, so you pray
for those assholes.

52:05.587 --> 52:07.920
Kelvin, seriously now,
watch your mouth, boy.

52:07.922 --> 52:10.923
See, Dad's saying that we're
meant to be praying for the Klan.

52:10.925 --> 52:14.694
Is that what you want? What, you want
Ma using her prayer time on the Klan?

52:14.696 --> 52:16.529
I don't need to be telling
your mama what to pray for.

52:16.531 --> 52:18.698
Right answer.

52:18.700 --> 52:21.901
I'm not even gonna comment on
Mr. Hunter's driving abilities.

52:21.903 --> 52:26.839
All I know is that the shop is closed
right now, and that's what we want, right?

52:26.841 --> 52:29.508
I mean, that's what you
asked us to pray for, right?

52:29.510 --> 52:31.512
- Right?
- Right. Yeah. Yes, ma'am.

52:33.615 --> 52:35.917
Right.

52:38.987 --> 52:40.953
- Hello?
- <i>Yo, man, it's Grant.</i>

52:40.955 --> 52:44.790
<i>He got beat down real bad.
He in the hospital.</i>

52:44.792 --> 52:46.527
<i>Yo, come right now.</i>

52:53.868 --> 52:55.436
We got to go.
It's Grant.

53:01.809 --> 53:03.576
The kids
are playing in the back.

53:03.578 --> 53:05.645
- You want to come on through?
- Yes, ma'am.

53:05.647 --> 53:08.714
I don't believe you've
ever been here before.

53:08.716 --> 53:12.620
Well, come and let me show you.
This is... This is our museum.

53:14.822 --> 53:16.889
Isn't it wonderful?

53:16.891 --> 53:20.693
Well, you know, blacks are welcome
here, too, just like the whites.

53:20.695 --> 53:23.698
Blacks fought and died
for the Confederacy.

53:24.666 --> 53:26.532
Where is Mike?

53:26.534 --> 53:29.769
Oh, I'm s...
Mike had a tow, so he had to leave.

53:29.771 --> 53:31.771
But the kids
are all in the back.

53:39.514 --> 53:41.047
Okay, come on.

53:41.049 --> 53:42.848
Stick it into
that dark meat. Go.

53:42.850 --> 53:45.885
Go, go, go. That's good.
Stick it in that dark meat.

53:45.887 --> 53:49.021
That's good, boy.

53:49.023 --> 53:50.925
Stick it in there.

53:55.029 --> 53:56.963
Franklin.
Franklin, here.

53:56.965 --> 53:58.597
Come here.

53:58.599 --> 54:00.032
You give that back.
Give that knife back.

54:00.034 --> 54:02.001
Uh, no. That knife is a
gift to your son from me.

54:02.003 --> 54:03.769
No, we don't need it.
You give that back.

54:03.771 --> 54:06.040
No, it's fine.
A gift is a gift.

54:12.013 --> 54:14.482
- Be careful.
- What?

54:17.552 --> 54:18.753
Be careful.

54:27.895 --> 54:28.963
Hey, baby.

54:29.731 --> 54:30.832
Hey.

54:33.801 --> 54:36.771
What's up?
Hey, hoss.

54:37.939 --> 54:39.774
Nice little bowie
you got there.

54:41.042 --> 54:43.911
Tom Griffin gave it to him.
Told him to cut dark meat with it.

54:45.780 --> 54:48.581
- Isn't that right, son?
- Yes, Mom.

54:48.583 --> 54:49.884
Go to your room.

54:53.721 --> 54:55.121
Just a figure of speech.

54:55.123 --> 54:57.790
Are you out of
your freaking mind?

54:57.792 --> 55:00.828
I saw Tom teaching him
with my own two eyes.

55:02.597 --> 55:04.930
That is it. It's over. I don't give two
damns what you did when you was alone.

55:04.932 --> 55:06.932
- You ain't alone no more.
- I know.

55:06.934 --> 55:08.734
When that son of a bitch starts
messing with my son's mind,

55:08.736 --> 55:10.102
that's where
I draw the line.

55:10.104 --> 55:12.172
It's just a knife.
I had one when I was his age.

55:12.174 --> 55:14.907
Yeah.
Look where it got you.

55:14.909 --> 55:16.944
Straight in the arms
of Tom Griffin.

55:18.713 --> 55:20.014
Michael...

55:22.817 --> 55:24.619
you know, I...

55:29.123 --> 55:30.925
I know you're Klan.

55:36.664 --> 55:37.965
I still love you.

55:42.036 --> 55:45.039
Do you really think that Tom Griffin
would love you if you weren't?

55:49.977 --> 55:52.880
I hate saying this because
I'm so afraid of losing you...

55:54.982 --> 55:56.818
but you gotta choose.

56:11.065 --> 56:12.265
<i>No justice, no peace.</i>

56:12.267 --> 56:13.933
<i>No justice, no peace!</i>

56:13.935 --> 56:15.935
No justice, no peace!
No justice, no peace!

56:15.937 --> 56:18.704
- No justice, no peace.
- No justice, no peace!

56:18.706 --> 56:20.240
- More love. More love.
- More love.

56:20.242 --> 56:21.874
- More love!
- Hate won't win.

56:21.876 --> 56:23.976
- Hate won't win!
- Love, not hate!

56:23.978 --> 56:25.678
Love, not hate!

56:25.680 --> 56:26.946
That's right. That's right.

56:26.948 --> 56:29.815
Now, I was hoping

56:29.817 --> 56:31.451
not to
be back at this place.

56:31.453 --> 56:34.854
But here we are.

56:34.856 --> 56:37.022
I think they was hoping

56:37.024 --> 56:39.024
that we wouldn't be back
in this place, too.

56:39.026 --> 56:41.161
Yeah, they were.

56:41.163 --> 56:43.163
- But here we are.
- That's right.

56:43.165 --> 56:45.167
Thank you...

56:45.733 --> 56:49.169
- Be careful.
- ...for lending your body, not just in the protest

56:49.171 --> 56:53.005
of the glorification of the Ku Klux Klan...

56:53.007 --> 56:56.143
- ...and all the ugliness and hatred that it represents...
- Yes.

56:56.145 --> 57:01.013
...with their history of murder, of rape...

57:01.015 --> 57:03.115
- Yeah!
- ...of inciting terror

57:03.117 --> 57:05.285
in the hearts of people
of color,

57:05.287 --> 57:08.087
but towards the march
of equality...

57:09.724 --> 57:12.492
...towards peace,
towards unity

57:12.494 --> 57:16.729
for all men and women
in this great country.

57:16.731 --> 57:18.030
That's right.

57:18.032 --> 57:19.201
- There we go.
- Amen.

57:24.805 --> 57:27.873
The niggers are coming.
They're coming up the street.

57:27.875 --> 57:31.010
All right. Here we go.
Uh, Clint, you and the boys wait here.

57:31.012 --> 57:32.947
Mike, come with me.

57:37.319 --> 57:39.221
You're up on the roof.

57:40.755 --> 57:43.225
Remember, a man has a right
to protect himself.

57:48.230 --> 57:49.298
Yeah.

57:51.166 --> 57:54.534
No, no, no, no, no, boys.
My brothers. My sons.

57:54.536 --> 57:56.203
Calm down.
Remember why we're here.

57:56.205 --> 57:57.738
Stay calm.

58:02.109 --> 58:04.011
How long are we gonna
let this go on?

58:04.879 --> 58:07.316
Either you protest peacefully
or you go on home.

58:08.283 --> 58:10.751
Why don't you go on
and tell Grant about peace.

58:20.094 --> 58:22.995
Son, what are you thinking about?
What are you doing?

58:22.997 --> 58:25.866
Hold on.

58:26.235 --> 58:29.202
Y'all want to go see the
museum, it's gonna cost you ten bucks.

58:29.204 --> 58:31.304
Might want to stop by
the bank, though,

58:31.306 --> 58:33.206
'cause we don't take
food stamps.

58:33.208 --> 58:34.873
See, that's just...

58:34.875 --> 58:37.377
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Right there, man.

58:37.379 --> 58:39.945
Let's not do anything
before things get out of hand, now.

58:39.947 --> 58:41.314
Before things
get out of hand, go.

58:41.316 --> 58:43.283
Y'all heard Reverend. Go.

58:43.285 --> 58:44.752
Hey, Kennedy.

58:46.120 --> 58:50.858
You come to check out the merchandise?
We got some new stuff for you.

58:52.261 --> 58:56.895
You can get your picture taken in
full Klan regalia for 15 bucks.

58:56.897 --> 58:59.366
Only for you,
it's free of charge.

58:59.368 --> 59:03.169
Don't you want to know what it
feels like to have the real power?

59:03.171 --> 59:05.037
He ain't got no power.

59:05.039 --> 59:08.310
Come on!
Give it a shot.

59:11.112 --> 59:15.315
I bet your uncle would've preferred to be
under this hood than under a train trestle.

59:17.419 --> 59:19.321
- Come on!
- Back up! Yo!

59:37.104 --> 59:40.973
- Everybody, let's file out. Let's go on home.
- Y'all heard Reverend.

59:40.975 --> 59:43.942
- File on out, everybody. Just go home.
- Let's go. Let's go.

59:43.944 --> 59:45.878
File out.
Janice, get 'em on out of here.

59:45.880 --> 59:48.047
<i>♪ Kumba, kumba,
Kumba vista... ♪</i>

59:48.049 --> 59:49.948
Don't you be eyeballing me,
you fucking nigger.

59:49.950 --> 59:51.184
What'd you call me?

59:52.387 --> 59:55.054
- Kelvin!
- Come on, fucking nigger!

01:00:09.404 --> 01:00:11.340
Let's go. Let's go.

01:00:12.106 --> 01:00:13.241
Baby!

01:00:36.964 --> 01:00:39.265
Listen, Tom,
we're gonna take him down.

01:00:39.267 --> 01:00:41.033
We ain't gonna process him,
all right?

01:00:41.035 --> 01:00:42.535
So he'll be back
in an hour and a half.

01:00:42.537 --> 01:00:44.071
Okay. Thanks.

01:00:52.414 --> 01:00:55.049
Well, at least someone had
the balls to try something.

01:00:55.684 --> 01:00:58.220
Just can't believe
it was Clint and not you.

01:02:14.529 --> 01:02:17.564
I think your mama'll understand

01:02:17.566 --> 01:02:19.399
when I tell her
we're having faggot for dinner.

01:02:19.401 --> 01:02:21.568
I know you.

01:02:21.570 --> 01:02:23.536
- Let me up!
- Fuck you think you're doing?

01:02:23.538 --> 01:02:25.505
You forget good,
old-fashioned Southern hospitality?

01:02:58.273 --> 01:03:00.007
Better late
than never, son.

01:03:08.316 --> 01:03:10.218
You're out of order,
Klansman.

01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:14.623
Fine with me.
I ain't no Klansman no more.

01:03:17.192 --> 01:03:19.526
Now, you just
settle down, boy.

01:03:19.528 --> 01:03:22.595
Don't go writing no check
your ass can't cash.

01:03:22.597 --> 01:03:26.299
Michael, honey, maybe
you should just sleep this off.

01:03:26.301 --> 01:03:27.602
There ain't nothing
to sleep off.

01:03:31.573 --> 01:03:34.242
You want to leave?
That's fine.

01:03:35.277 --> 01:03:36.578
Don't mean a thing
to me.

01:03:38.647 --> 01:03:40.181
Go.

01:03:46.288 --> 01:03:48.055
God help you, son.

01:03:49.891 --> 01:03:53.226
When was the last time you saw
God anywhere around these parts?

01:03:53.228 --> 01:03:57.198
I told you, Tom.
That Judy must've had some nigger in her.

01:04:01.736 --> 01:04:05.438
Anybody else got anything to say?
Huh?

01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:07.175
Any y'all?

01:04:08.143 --> 01:04:09.411
Yeah, that's what
I thought.

01:04:24.926 --> 01:04:26.328
Hey, you stay here.

01:04:39.541 --> 01:04:41.142
I'm out.

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:20.281
What's up, little man?

01:05:22.651 --> 01:05:25.387
Go ahead.
Want to put this cable back on?

01:05:25.787 --> 01:05:27.322
If I can reach.

01:05:28.223 --> 01:05:29.355
I ca...
Yeah, I can't reach.

01:05:29.357 --> 01:05:30.790
Never pull down.

01:05:30.792 --> 01:05:33.426
That's the first lesson
of mechanics.

01:05:33.428 --> 01:05:35.628
How about up and down?

01:05:35.630 --> 01:05:37.432
Yup.

01:05:40.235 --> 01:05:41.469
And the back.

01:06:05.026 --> 01:06:06.492
Y'all got to vacate
the premises

01:06:06.494 --> 01:06:08.361
by order of
the sheriff's department.

01:06:08.363 --> 01:06:10.797
- What are you talking about?
- Failure to pay rent.

01:06:10.799 --> 01:06:13.733
That ain't right.
We're all paid up.

01:06:13.735 --> 01:06:16.469
It's the middle of the night right now.
We got a kid in here.

01:06:16.471 --> 01:06:18.805
You can take it up with
the judge in the morning.

01:06:18.807 --> 01:06:23.211
Meantime, you got 30 minutes
to gather your belongings.

01:06:24.379 --> 01:06:25.747
You got anything
in the kitchen you need?

01:06:36.524 --> 01:06:39.360
Up we go.

01:06:46.634 --> 01:06:49.302
Lion! We forgot Lion!

01:06:49.304 --> 01:06:50.505
I'll go get it.

01:06:51.773 --> 01:06:53.374
You're out of time.

01:06:54.776 --> 01:06:57.412
- It's the kid's stuffed toy.
- Not my problem.

01:06:58.379 --> 01:07:00.446
It's a fucking stuffed toy.

01:07:00.448 --> 01:07:03.318
No, I think it's okay to go
get the kid's toy, but, uh...

01:07:04.419 --> 01:07:05.854
we're gonna take
the keys to the truck.

01:07:13.762 --> 01:07:15.497
Feel like
you got them all?

01:07:16.664 --> 01:07:18.299
Why don't you
rinse that out.

01:07:20.401 --> 01:07:21.536
Hold it
a little while.

01:07:26.875 --> 01:07:29.742
That's good.
Now we got to check them.

01:07:29.744 --> 01:07:32.814
You know how you check them?
Check them like wolves.

01:07:55.537 --> 01:07:58.306
Do you happen to have any,
uh, jobs available here?

01:08:00.441 --> 01:08:01.709
Appreciate you.

01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:03.678
Do you happen to have
any jobs available here?

01:08:05.446 --> 01:08:06.781
Thank you.

01:08:10.685 --> 01:08:13.421
Yo, little man.
Thank you.

01:08:23.865 --> 01:08:25.765
Welcome to Chicken Run.

01:08:25.767 --> 01:08:28.837
Oh, yeah.
Thank you so much.

01:08:52.727 --> 01:08:53.795
Hey.

01:08:54.696 --> 01:08:56.531
I got fired!

01:09:04.505 --> 01:09:05.807
Klan's reach runs far.

01:09:07.774 --> 01:09:11.211
It's gonna be weeks before I
see anything from unemployment.

01:09:11.212 --> 01:09:13.578
I don't even have an address
to send a check to.

01:09:13.581 --> 01:09:15.514
Maybe we should leave town.

01:09:15.515 --> 01:09:17.852
Well, better the devil you know
than the devil you don't, huh?

01:09:19.453 --> 01:09:21.723
Should've told me that before
you made me leave the Klan.

01:09:23.992 --> 01:09:25.693
Well, I didn't.

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:33.868
Now we got to go to the grocery 'cause, uh, all
the food I got from the house is all gone.

01:09:38.573 --> 01:09:40.675
I put gas in the tank today.

01:09:44.045 --> 01:09:46.814
Are you saying
there's nothing left?

01:09:49.584 --> 01:09:52.453
Maybe a little something
for Franklin tonight.

01:09:58.893 --> 01:10:00.695
What about tomorrow?

01:10:09.904 --> 01:10:12.440
All right.

01:10:14.909 --> 01:10:17.677
You say "miss"
if she's not married.

01:10:17.679 --> 01:10:21.514
- You say "ma'am" if she looks old and respectable.
- Drop it.

01:10:21.516 --> 01:10:22.684
Hey, you got any change?

01:10:24.819 --> 01:10:27.053
- Spare any change, ma'am?
- No.

01:10:27.055 --> 01:10:28.788
Spare any change?

01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:30.589
Got any change?

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:34.062
Hey, you spare
some change?

01:10:36.864 --> 01:10:38.597
Hey, spare some change?

01:10:38.599 --> 01:10:40.735
Hey. Spare some change?

01:10:46.308 --> 01:10:49.010
Has the child and woman
eaten yet today?

01:10:51.846 --> 01:10:53.081
Why don't you ask them.

01:10:53.815 --> 01:10:55.049
All right.

01:11:21.642 --> 01:11:25.644
That tapioca there...
that's my son's favorite, too.

01:11:25.646 --> 01:11:26.681
What do you say, Franklin?

01:11:27.648 --> 01:11:28.914
Thank you.

01:11:28.916 --> 01:11:30.018
You're welcome.

01:11:33.021 --> 01:11:35.590
You know, Reverend,
Mike here... he, uh...

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:40.862
he left the Klan for us,
and that...

01:11:42.597 --> 01:11:44.932
that's why we're in this...

01:11:46.834 --> 01:11:48.836
what you might call
predicament.

01:11:52.073 --> 01:11:53.608
Where y'all been sleeping?

01:11:54.742 --> 01:11:55.810
In the car.

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:06.654
All right, then.

01:12:08.656 --> 01:12:11.959
Am I understanding that you
would like a room for that man?

01:12:15.029 --> 01:12:16.564
And his family.

01:12:18.367 --> 01:12:20.568
You know who that man is?

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.572
I know him as a brother
in Christ, Alvin.

01:12:25.374 --> 01:12:27.708
And I know him as a brother
in the Knights, Reverend.

01:12:32.914 --> 01:12:34.115
I'm sorry.
I'm booked up.

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:36.617
You're booked up?

01:12:37.985 --> 01:12:39.120
Can't do it, Reverend.

01:12:43.858 --> 01:12:45.827
You be careful with
your new friend, Reverend.

01:12:48.663 --> 01:12:51.063
- Dumbass Negro.
- I just want to say the pie was good.

01:12:51.065 --> 01:12:52.898
Thank you very much.

01:12:52.900 --> 01:12:54.167
- Yeah.
- How many pieces you eat this time?

01:12:54.169 --> 01:12:55.968
Uh, that was him!

01:12:55.970 --> 01:12:58.205
That's him.
That is you.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.972
- Hi. What's going on?
- Hey, Daddy.

01:12:59.974 --> 01:13:02.677
How you doing?

01:13:07.449 --> 01:13:10.219
What? I got a booger
hanging from my nose?

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.223
This here's Michael,

01:13:15.022 --> 01:13:17.857
that's Judy,
and this is Franklin.

01:13:17.859 --> 01:13:19.861
They're gonna be
staying with us for a while.

01:13:21.263 --> 01:13:24.930
Well, welcome.
Uh, let us get your things to...

01:13:24.932 --> 01:13:28.067
I figure that, uh, they could
stay downstairs in Kelvin's room.

01:13:28.069 --> 01:13:30.838
- Kelvin, you can sleep on the couch.
- My room?

01:13:31.772 --> 01:13:35.643
Kelvin, go and help them with their
belongings and show them down.

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:39.778
Yo, we better go home, head out.
Thanks for dinner, Ms. Kennedy.

01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:40.980
- Yup.
- Reverend.

01:13:40.982 --> 01:13:43.185
Yeah.
Night. God bless.

01:13:46.488 --> 01:13:49.158
I guess, just follow me.

01:14:07.909 --> 01:14:11.076
I know, I know. I know.
You're probably upset

01:14:11.078 --> 01:14:14.081
'cause they're under
our roof out of wedlock.

01:14:17.051 --> 01:14:20.085
And I... I should've...
I should've called you

01:14:20.087 --> 01:14:22.322
and told you that I was
gonna have dinner already.

01:14:22.324 --> 01:14:24.823
Oh, shoot, David.

01:14:24.825 --> 01:14:26.892
You miss two out of three meals
chasing the Lord's work,

01:14:26.894 --> 01:14:29.864
but this, this is...

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:32.267
Janice...

01:14:33.968 --> 01:14:35.270
they're living
out of their car.

01:14:36.238 --> 01:14:39.174
They got no food.
They got their kid.

01:14:41.310 --> 01:14:43.976
You know that Clarence...
he knows her pretty good.

01:14:43.978 --> 01:14:47.149
You and I both know we are not
talking about her or her son.

01:14:48.049 --> 01:14:50.183
How could you let that man
in this house

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:52.053
and endanger your family
like this?

01:14:56.991 --> 01:14:59.392
His woman said
that he's left the Klan

01:14:59.394 --> 01:15:01.127
and that's why
they're in this state.

01:15:01.129 --> 01:15:02.763
Did he tell you that?

01:15:09.971 --> 01:15:11.005
I've been praying.

01:15:13.107 --> 01:15:15.009
I've been praying
for some kind of sign.

01:15:15.843 --> 01:15:20.349
Now, if this ain't a sign,
then I don't know what is.

01:15:27.155 --> 01:15:28.856
I love your heart...

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:32.259
and you know I share
your faith in God,

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:36.862
but I'm just not sure
I share your faith in men.

01:15:44.172 --> 01:15:46.139
Yeah, go talk to your son.

01:15:46.141 --> 01:15:49.309
Yeah.
Hey, wait up there.

01:15:51.313 --> 01:15:54.180
I know you must be
bothered, but he...

01:15:54.182 --> 01:15:56.048
You know I don't agree
with your ways,

01:15:56.050 --> 01:15:58.385
but bringing your almighty
struggle into our house?

01:15:58.387 --> 01:16:02.121
- He left the Klan.
- Left what? You don't leave the Klan, Daddy.

01:16:02.123 --> 01:16:03.392
It's in you.

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:08.929
See, you see nothing
from up in those pulpits.

01:16:10.064 --> 01:16:13.235
I deal with guys like him every
single day on these grounds.

01:16:14.336 --> 01:16:15.803
They hate us.

01:16:18.873 --> 01:16:20.275
And now he's sleeping
in my bedroom.

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:24.045
Son.

01:16:49.036 --> 01:16:51.338
Mm-mm.
You don't have to be doing that.

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.907
It's all right.

01:17:13.060 --> 01:17:14.895
Come in. Come in.

01:17:18.433 --> 01:17:21.134
Oh. What, he asleep already?

01:17:21.136 --> 01:17:23.171
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:17:24.004 --> 01:17:25.338
Try to get yourselves
some sleep,

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:27.374
and we'll... we'll see you
in the morning.

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:31.146
Reverend,
thank you so much.

01:17:33.515 --> 01:17:35.283
All the praise go to God.

01:17:37.419 --> 01:17:43.090
Michael, gonna tomorrow see if
we can fix you up with some work.

01:17:48.062 --> 01:17:51.433
- Have a good night. You sleep well.
- You, too.

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:40.315
So, what did that little deer
ever do to you?

01:18:42.116 --> 01:18:44.051
That's the best thing
you could do for him.

01:18:48.523 --> 01:18:50.325
That's what my daddy
taught me.

01:18:52.026 --> 01:18:53.361
One time,
we was hunting.

01:18:53.795 --> 01:18:57.566
I must... must've just
been about Franklin's age.

01:18:59.301 --> 01:19:03.269
I was out in the woods,
all alone,

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:05.307
and this deer
come right up to me.

01:19:07.041 --> 01:19:08.477
And I was thinking,
how cute...

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:12.110
oh, how cute
this little thing was.

01:19:12.112 --> 01:19:14.516
Like old Bambi and all that other
shit, you know?

01:19:19.119 --> 01:19:23.088
And I knew in that moment
that he knew something about me,

01:19:23.090 --> 01:19:25.260
that he could sense
something about me.

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:29.496
And I knew we was gonna be
friends, and he knew it.

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:32.265
And all of a sudden,
just bam!

01:19:32.267 --> 01:19:35.002
My daddy blows its head
right fucking off.

01:19:39.274 --> 01:19:41.510
And he called me a pussy
when I cried.

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:52.387
I realized then that's the worst
thing you can do for them...

01:19:53.588 --> 01:19:55.355
make friends with them.

01:19:55.357 --> 01:19:57.122
'Cause they get comfortable
with you,

01:19:57.124 --> 01:19:58.593
they're just gonna end up
getting killed.

01:20:17.245 --> 01:20:19.612
All right, then.
Start tomorrow.

01:20:23.885 --> 01:20:25.618
Ma, there ain't no hot sauce?

01:20:25.620 --> 01:20:28.187
I forgot the hot sauce.

01:20:28.189 --> 01:20:29.889
You can't have no pork
chop with no hot sauce, now.

01:20:29.891 --> 01:20:32.425
- I'll go get it. I'll go get it.
- What you gonna do?

01:20:32.427 --> 01:20:35.328
Something's wrong with this.
It don't taste right.

01:20:35.330 --> 01:20:38.600
What did I say, G?
You tell them what I said.

01:20:39.701 --> 01:20:42.135
- Hey! It's good, though.
- Thank you.

01:20:42.137 --> 01:20:44.337
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:20:44.339 --> 01:20:47.640
- Mike! Look who came for dinner!
- Y'all good?

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:50.209
- Hey, Mike.
- What's up there, little D?

01:20:50.211 --> 01:20:51.744
Hey.

01:20:51.746 --> 01:20:54.681
- Hey, baby.
- Hi.

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:56.549
Can I get
the hot sauce, please?

01:20:56.551 --> 01:20:58.618
- Hot sauce?
- It's hot, now.

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.353
I know. That's why it's
called "hot sauce."

01:21:00.355 --> 01:21:02.089
Oh.

01:21:02.657 --> 01:21:04.257
I'll go wash up.

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:06.225
We got some plates in there
for y'all.

01:21:06.227 --> 01:21:08.595
I'm not hungry.
Thank y'all.

01:21:08.597 --> 01:21:10.763
- Be careful, now.
- It might be too hot for you, Franklin.

01:21:10.765 --> 01:21:12.332
- Ooh!
- Oh, that's good.

01:21:14.235 --> 01:21:16.469
<i>Number four, Ronny.
He's finally gonna do it.</i>

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:19.172
<i>There he goes.
Waiting on the outside.</i>

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:22.175
<i>That's what you've been waiting for.
Look at him go. Yes, sir.</i>

01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:25.378
<i>Oh! Couple more cars to pass
and he'll be in the lead!</i>

01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:27.947
<i>Look at him coming back
right there on the front.</i>

01:21:27.949 --> 01:21:31.284
Can we go down into the pits?
I want to play in Tom's car.

01:21:31.286 --> 01:21:33.653
- We got to sit up here.
- <i>There he goes, folks.</i>

01:21:33.655 --> 01:21:37.490
- Now, you want to get some roasted nuts or something?
- No, I'm okay.

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:40.293
<i>Another great turn.
He's making his final move.</i>

01:21:40.295 --> 01:21:43.329
<i>And now he's got the lead, folks!
He's got the lead!</i>

01:21:43.331 --> 01:21:45.433
<i>That's what I'm talking...
Oh! Oh!</i>

01:21:46.768 --> 01:21:48.570
<i>...banks off the wall.</i>

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:53.773
<i>Stay back.</i>

01:22:09.524 --> 01:22:11.391
You sit right there.
You don't move, all right?

01:22:11.393 --> 01:22:13.194
- Yes, sir.
- Keep an eye on him.

01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.740
Well, they didn't say
a damn thing.

01:22:27.742 --> 01:22:29.575
I got a feeling
if there was something bad,

01:22:29.577 --> 01:22:31.746
- they would've come on out.
- Oh, good Lord.

01:22:34.315 --> 01:22:35.350
Hello, Mike.

01:22:41.756 --> 01:22:43.358
Come here.

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:50.265
Saw you at the races.
Hoped you'd come down, see if he was okay.

01:22:52.767 --> 01:22:56.337
Well, no matter what's gone down
between us, it's still Ronny, you know?

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:03.611
Listen, I know I can be
a pigheaded son of a gun.

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:08.783
But when you split, I...

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:13.555
I mean, I'm just...
I'm just too old to lose a son.

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:16.424
That's how
I think of you, Mike.

01:23:18.526 --> 01:23:21.060
So, come on home.

01:23:21.062 --> 01:23:23.331
You don't belong
living with niggers.

01:23:24.632 --> 01:23:25.834
I'm just here for Ronny.

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:31.637
- Hazel misses you something awful.
- Look, it's just harder now.

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:36.576
Yeah, of course it is. That fucking
Kennedy bossing you around and shit.

01:23:36.578 --> 01:23:38.845
Christ, I thought you were gonna
get rid of him for this town.

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:41.547
Now you're his whipping boy.
Well, that ain't no way to live.

01:23:41.549 --> 01:23:43.551
- Look, it ain't nothing like that.
- Yes, it is.

01:23:50.525 --> 01:23:51.760
You hear that?

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:58.531
It's that old sound
of nothing... again.

01:23:58.533 --> 01:23:59.834
The sound of nothing,
huh?

01:24:02.670 --> 01:24:06.307
Man, your bullshit's so loud right
now, my fucking ears is ringing.

01:24:31.833 --> 01:24:34.435
Yeah!

01:25:17.478 --> 01:25:19.812
Hey, Burden!
Got a visitor!

01:25:23.751 --> 01:25:26.821
- Judy?
- What you doing here?

01:25:27.755 --> 01:25:29.989
Well, you know,
we had leftovers from the dinner drive,

01:25:29.991 --> 01:25:32.024
so I thought
y'all could use them.

01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:34.694
That's so thoughtful of you, Judy.
You shouldn't have.

01:25:34.696 --> 01:25:38.198
Can't take all the credit.
Toosie and Jan cooked their behinds off.

01:25:42.904 --> 01:25:44.570
Y'all enjoy your lunch.

01:25:44.572 --> 01:25:45.905
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:25:45.907 --> 01:25:47.207
Ah, appreciate you.

01:25:47.209 --> 01:25:48.708
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:25:48.710 --> 01:25:51.946
Seems like a good gig
for you.

01:25:54.183 --> 01:25:56.918
- It's a paycheck.
- Mm-hmm. Well...

01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:00.722
I'm real proud of you.

01:26:07.528 --> 01:26:09.528
Tell your old lady
thanks for us.

01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:11.599
- Appreciate you.
- One fine meal.

01:26:12.667 --> 01:26:13.768
I'll tell her
you say that.

01:26:14.636 --> 01:26:16.571
Fine meal from a fine woman.

01:26:18.840 --> 01:26:20.673
What?
Ain't no shame in that.

01:26:20.675 --> 01:26:22.543
Man, you think
you're fucking funny?

01:26:23.245 --> 01:26:25.578
- What you gonna do?
- Let that go, man.

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:28.814
Just keep your mouth shut about my
girl, everything be cool.

01:26:28.816 --> 01:26:31.684
I don't think you get it.
I'm the boss here, boy.

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:33.552
I ain't nobody's boy,
man.

01:26:33.554 --> 01:26:35.554
Listen, it's been
one hell of a hot morning,

01:26:35.556 --> 01:26:37.823
and we need to just chill.
Mike, chill out, man.

01:26:37.825 --> 01:26:39.560
Al, come on, man.

01:26:40.028 --> 01:26:42.795
Shit, I'm just
fucking with you.

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:46.565
But I'd sure love to tap that ass.

01:26:46.567 --> 01:26:47.902
What'd you say, nigger?

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:53.739
Get off me! Get him off of me!

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:56.575
- Get off him, Mike!
- Say it again!

01:26:56.577 --> 01:26:59.712
- Get him off of me!
- Say that again! I fucking dare you!

01:26:59.714 --> 01:27:01.948
Chill out.
Chill out. Chill out.

01:27:01.950 --> 01:27:04.850
- You out your goddamn mind?
- Did you hear what he said?

01:27:04.852 --> 01:27:07.019
- Get him out of here.
- Come on, Clarence.

01:27:07.021 --> 01:27:09.722
Let's get out of here.

01:27:09.724 --> 01:27:11.726
- Come on!
- Nah, Mike!

01:27:14.095 --> 01:27:15.697
Oh, fuck y'all.

01:27:16.931 --> 01:27:18.064
He said "nigger," huh?

01:27:18.066 --> 01:27:21.602
- Yeah.
- So, he got fired, then?

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:23.803
Well, yeah.

01:27:23.805 --> 01:27:25.771
He needs to go back
to where he belongs.

01:27:25.773 --> 01:27:28.941
- Back to the Klan?
- He actually said "nigger"?

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:31.978
Sister Kennedy, it weren't like that.
All right, so he...

01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:34.947
I don't think the man know
what he saying half the time.

01:27:34.949 --> 01:27:37.049
And it was over Judy.
It was all over the place.

01:27:37.051 --> 01:27:39.986
Clarence, that man don't
know nothing but how to hate.

01:27:39.988 --> 01:27:44.724
Can't get rid of hate unless you
replace it with something else.

01:27:44.726 --> 01:27:47.528
H-He love Judy and Franklin.

01:27:48.130 --> 01:27:51.097
That should be the first step
to help to let go.

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:52.934
The boy is Klan.

01:27:54.902 --> 01:27:57.036
And he's not
all that smart to boot.

01:27:57.038 --> 01:27:59.607
You know, I feel sorry
for boys like that.

01:28:01.042 --> 01:28:07.048
They've been told that being born
white is the end-all, be-all.

01:28:08.317 --> 01:28:11.819
But then they got to look
at their sorry-ass lives.

01:28:12.354 --> 01:28:15.888
White, male, poor,

01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:19.658
raised up in...
in brutality and addiction,

01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:23.095
lacking education, lacking...

01:28:23.097 --> 01:28:26.932
Teeth.
Lacking teeth.

01:28:28.870 --> 01:28:31.105
What you gonna do?

01:28:41.816 --> 01:28:43.017
So, what you gonna do?

01:28:49.057 --> 01:28:50.124
I'm gonna pray.

01:29:21.856 --> 01:29:24.692
Klan... bastard!

01:29:43.744 --> 01:29:45.113
I do not want him here.

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:47.147
What?

01:29:47.149 --> 01:29:51.052
I, me, the man...

01:29:52.053 --> 01:29:57.859
do not want that man
in our house.

01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:03.865
But...

01:30:04.799 --> 01:30:08.769
this family, that man...

01:30:12.474 --> 01:30:14.041
If I abandoned him now...

01:30:17.146 --> 01:30:19.780
I won't be able
to preach no more.

01:30:41.470 --> 01:30:42.803
Are you drunk?

01:30:44.805 --> 01:30:49.775
More drunk than sober.
Not as drunk as I ever been.

01:30:49.777 --> 01:30:51.977
Goddamn it, Mike!
I already got one child to deal with!

01:30:51.979 --> 01:30:54.514
- I don't need a-fucking-nother!
- I was protecting your ass. None of this would've...

01:30:54.516 --> 01:30:57.016
Protecting me by getting your ass fired?
By calling him a fucking nigger?

01:30:57.018 --> 01:30:59.352
None of this would've happened
if you didn't come on down there

01:30:59.354 --> 01:31:01.954
wearing that goddamn dress, trying
to flirt with all those fucking guys!

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:04.089
Are you fucking crazy?

01:31:04.091 --> 01:31:06.825
Is that what's going through your fucked-up
mind? That's what you think of me?

01:31:06.827 --> 01:31:09.028
You think I'm some fucking whore
trying to get over on your foreman?

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:12.232
Is that what you think?
Is that what you...

01:31:12.234 --> 01:31:16.037
God. Yeah...
Maybe I should just...

01:31:19.106 --> 01:31:21.974
Maybe I should just go and get
me another guy to get with.

01:31:21.976 --> 01:31:23.842
Oh, yeah, you get yourself
another guy.

01:31:23.844 --> 01:31:27.280
- It's like you ain't never had a woman.
- Well, I haven't!

01:31:27.282 --> 01:31:29.782
I got all this shit
coming down on me!

01:31:29.784 --> 01:31:31.752
How am I supposed
to deal with that, huh?

01:31:33.854 --> 01:31:36.256
I don't even know
what I'm fucking doing here,

01:31:36.258 --> 01:31:39.259
with you, Franklin and
all these fucking people!

01:31:39.261 --> 01:31:41.894
Yeah, maybe I am crazy because
this ain't my fucking life!

01:31:41.896 --> 01:31:45.232
This is our life! This is our
life, and you keep fucking it up!

01:31:45.234 --> 01:31:49.868
Yeah! I'm fucking crazy, huh?
I'm mad! I'm bad! I'm evil!

01:31:49.870 --> 01:31:52.106
Yeah, out of
my fucked-up mind, huh?

01:31:57.078 --> 01:31:59.078
You stay...

01:31:59.080 --> 01:32:00.848
stay away from me.

01:33:33.941 --> 01:33:35.243
Been looking for you.

01:33:39.147 --> 01:33:40.382
What you doing over there?

01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:44.252
My uncle's grave.

01:33:45.253 --> 01:33:49.391
On his birthday, I go out,
I throw him a little party.

01:33:50.425 --> 01:33:52.294
Them flowers is from my wife.

01:33:53.228 --> 01:33:55.963
He loved them balloon just about
as much as he loved that wine.

01:33:57.132 --> 01:33:59.064
Is this your uncle
you said...

01:33:59.066 --> 01:34:02.337
Was lynched by the Klan.

01:34:06.006 --> 01:34:08.477
Aren't you ever worried
that's gonna happen to you?

01:34:12.447 --> 01:34:13.914
Should I be?

01:34:17.486 --> 01:34:22.288
Michael, if you truly
want to leave the Klan,

01:34:22.290 --> 01:34:25.227
then your first step
is admitting what you done.

01:34:29.297 --> 01:34:30.898
Here you go, uncle.

01:34:35.203 --> 01:34:36.937
You know,
when I was growing up...

01:34:38.038 --> 01:34:41.376
my mama used to take
the bus to work.

01:34:44.179 --> 01:34:46.179
And on that route
she took home,

01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:48.148
there was a dog

01:34:48.150 --> 01:34:51.520
that was staked to the yard
of this man's house.

01:34:54.054 --> 01:34:58.460
Many times, she'd see that dog
being brutally beaten by that man.

01:34:59.461 --> 01:35:02.096
One day,
when that man wasn't home...

01:35:03.432 --> 01:35:07.467
she got off the bus
and she stole that dog,

01:35:07.469 --> 01:35:11.239
and she brung him home
and she named him Solomon.

01:35:12.106 --> 01:35:16.008
That dog...
he was so grateful.

01:35:16.010 --> 01:35:18.076
And if ever somebody
went through

01:35:18.078 --> 01:35:20.580
the tiniest little squabble
with my mama,

01:35:20.582 --> 01:35:23.351
she'd have to put Solomon
in another room.

01:35:24.352 --> 01:35:28.022
Otherwise, that dog,
he would bite.

01:35:39.234 --> 01:35:42.034
You can come with me
if you want.

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:45.207
Now, I could tell you
ain't had the best of life.

01:35:46.374 --> 01:35:50.810
But you can't go through life
thinking like a beaten dog.

01:35:50.812 --> 01:35:52.980
I ain't a thinking man
like you, Rev.

01:35:54.516 --> 01:35:57.517
All I was trying to do was
just find a nice little place

01:35:57.519 --> 01:36:00.054
for me and Judy
to just have a home.

01:36:01.256 --> 01:36:02.524
Have a family.

01:36:03.492 --> 01:36:06.159
So I don't have to keep
looking over my shoulder,

01:36:06.161 --> 01:36:08.194
feeling like
I got to keep choosing sides.

01:36:08.196 --> 01:36:11.197
Align yourself with love,

01:36:11.199 --> 01:36:15.370
with God,
and there will be no more sides.

01:36:16.838 --> 01:36:20.373
But you must take
responsibility for your actions.

01:36:20.375 --> 01:36:24.246
Then you can repent
and find redemption.

01:36:32.554 --> 01:36:35.190
I appreciate everything
you done for us.

01:36:36.525 --> 01:36:39.995
I just know that being with
you, it ain't safe.

01:36:41.830 --> 01:36:44.064
It's time for us
to just move on.

01:36:52.173 --> 01:36:53.673
Saw a trailer
on the side of the street

01:36:53.675 --> 01:36:56.444
that was selling
for about a thousand bucks.

01:37:02.651 --> 01:37:04.617
I was wondering
if maybe you knew somebody

01:37:04.619 --> 01:37:08.055
that might want to buy
a building for about that much.

01:37:28.443 --> 01:37:32.478
Sir, if I call you my enemy,
I'll walk through Heaven

01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:34.683
and I will punch God
just to get to you.

01:37:36.651 --> 01:37:38.587
If I call you my friend...

01:37:41.656 --> 01:37:45.460
I'll walk through hell
and I'll slap the devil for you.

01:37:55.437 --> 01:37:57.503
Hey there, Bob.

01:37:57.505 --> 01:37:59.307
Just in time
for the end of lunch.

01:37:59.941 --> 01:38:02.109
Got no time
for the good stuff today.

01:38:02.644 --> 01:38:05.378

Ah! Oh, no. He got it.
That's first down.

01:41:18.673 --> 01:41:20.706
How'd you let him
get by you, Franklin?

01:41:20.708 --> 01:41:22.577
I was over in the army.

01:41:23.378 --> 01:41:25.444
I was parachuting down.

01:41:25.446 --> 01:41:28.514
Landed on a big ol' tree.

01:41:28.516 --> 01:41:32.652
Hit the ground pretty hard. Ended up
breaking almost every bone in my damn body.

01:41:32.654 --> 01:41:34.622
Got titanium
in my knee here.

01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:36.891
Broke my collarbone,
just like...

01:41:41.496 --> 01:41:43.830
- Get the fuck up!
- Hey, man, get up!

01:41:45.867 --> 01:41:48.734
Look at me. Look at me.

01:41:48.736 --> 01:41:52.405
Well, this is
a pleasant surprise.

01:41:52.407 --> 01:41:54.740
We was talking about you,
and here you all are.

01:41:54.742 --> 01:41:57.610
It's a pity, though.
We were gonna have a bonfire,

01:41:57.612 --> 01:41:59.512
maybe roast up
some marshmallows.

01:41:59.514 --> 01:42:03.516
Because y'all is here,
there ain't enough for everybody.

01:42:03.518 --> 01:42:06.855
The only way y'all burning
anything down is over my dead body.

01:42:07.689 --> 01:42:11.457
Well, lookee here, son.
You might just get what you're asking for.

01:42:13.895 --> 01:42:14.963
I ain't your son.

01:42:16.631 --> 01:42:18.399
You're damn right.

01:42:23.205 --> 01:42:26.873
All my life, I've been treated
like one of them pit bulls

01:42:26.875 --> 01:42:28.810
y'all got
staked to your lawn,

01:42:29.644 --> 01:42:32.879
grateful for everything Tom gave
me, snarling at nothing.

01:42:32.881 --> 01:42:36.651
I ain't getting down
on all fours for you no more.

01:42:40.655 --> 01:42:43.524
This time, you ain't
sneaking up on nobody.

01:42:44.193 --> 01:42:46.226
You're right, Gus.

01:42:46.228 --> 01:42:48.594
'Cause this time
I ain't raising a finger.

01:42:48.596 --> 01:42:50.730
I like my marshmallows burnt.

01:42:50.732 --> 01:42:52.600
Like that.

01:42:54.236 --> 01:42:57.570
I said let him be.
This has nothing to do with him. It's me.

01:42:57.572 --> 01:42:59.507
It's about him.
You ought to know that.

01:43:00.608 --> 01:43:03.676
- No.
- You like that, you motherfucker?

01:43:03.678 --> 01:43:07.680
- Fucking piece of shit.
- Let's get on with this.

01:43:07.682 --> 01:43:09.651
I'll take that shit.
Now we're gonna watch them burn.

01:43:11.853 --> 01:43:14.553
- No. Enough!
- What the fuck?

01:43:14.555 --> 01:43:15.690
Stop!

01:43:16.758 --> 01:43:17.825
It's over.

01:43:18.493 --> 01:43:19.759
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

01:43:19.761 --> 01:43:21.696
Get the fuck out of here.

01:43:38.579 --> 01:43:40.982
You think
you won something tonight?

01:43:41.916 --> 01:43:44.717
You think this is
ever gonna end?

01:43:44.719 --> 01:43:48.087
Never.
We ain't ever gonna stop.

01:43:48.089 --> 01:43:52.992
That reverend,
that church, that boy...

01:43:52.994 --> 01:43:54.862
we're gonna burn 'em down.

01:43:55.997 --> 01:43:59.600
And that woman of yours...
I'm gonna enjoy that.

01:44:01.002 --> 01:44:05.305
You're a poison
in the well of these folks.

01:44:05.307 --> 01:44:07.508
Anybody who takes you in.

01:44:23.024 --> 01:44:25.793
Can you please state
your full name for the record?

01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:30.031
Michael Roderick Burden.

01:44:31.632 --> 01:44:33.333
You are aware
that you're being deposed

01:44:33.335 --> 01:44:35.335
in the case of
<i>Kennedy v. Griffin?</i>

01:44:35.337 --> 01:44:37.069
I am.

01:44:37.071 --> 01:44:39.005
In April,
do you recall Tom Griffin

01:44:39.007 --> 01:44:40.906
signing over the deed
to the property

01:44:40.908 --> 01:44:43.644
at 108 West Laurens Street
to you?

01:44:44.078 --> 01:44:45.613
Yes, sir.

01:44:46.647 --> 01:44:48.082
And while staying
with the Reverend Kennedy,

01:44:49.218 --> 01:44:51.784
you sold this property to the
New Beginnings Baptist Church

01:44:51.786 --> 01:44:53.087
for $1,000?

01:44:54.055 --> 01:44:55.123
Yeah.

01:44:55.923 --> 01:44:57.790
While you were
with the Kennedys,

01:44:57.792 --> 01:44:59.658
you also informed
the Reverend Kennedy

01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:02.697
about a plot to kill him
involving Tom Griffin?

01:45:04.166 --> 01:45:06.899
Yeah.
He asked me to kill him.

01:45:06.901 --> 01:45:09.003
- "He"?
- Tom Griffin.

01:45:11.639 --> 01:45:15.543
Is there anything more you would
like to add to your statement, Mr. Burden?

01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:19.680
Yeah.

01:45:27.088 --> 01:45:28.956
June 23...

01:45:30.958 --> 01:45:32.327
1996.

01:45:36.198 --> 01:45:37.965
I beat a man real bad.

01:45:39.867 --> 01:45:42.970
His name was... Grant Davis.

01:45:46.941 --> 01:45:49.744
You realize you're
incriminating yourself in a felony?

01:45:55.983 --> 01:45:57.752
I acted alone.

01:46:00.121 --> 01:46:01.856
I am sorry.

01:47:51.866 --> 01:47:53.235
I was up on that roof...

01:47:56.037 --> 01:47:58.105
rifle in my hand,
and I couldn't do it.

01:48:00.841 --> 01:48:02.007

01:48:36.245 --> 01:48:38.045
I want you to know
I'm sorry.

01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:43.252
Hope maybe one day
y'all can forgive me.

01:48:49.023 --> 01:48:51.126
