02:09.080 --> 02:11.072
No. And have l to tell yer why?

02:11.561 --> 02:15.190
For one thing, you've to be able
to read and write before they set yer on.

02:15.281 --> 02:18.000
And they wouldn't have
a weedy little twat like thee.

02:18.081 --> 02:21.551

05:35.481 --> 05:38.951
- How long d'yer think that's gonna take?
- lt'll not take me long.

05:39.041 --> 05:43.557
There's a waiting list a mile long
for that job. Good lads, too, most of 'em.

05:43.641 --> 05:47.520
- From up Firs Hill, round there.
- l haven't let you down, have l?

05:48.081 --> 05:50.231

- Oh, right.

05:55.881 --> 06:00.033

06:01.001 --> 06:03.515
(customer) Thank you. Right. Cheerio.

06:03.601 --> 06:05.876
- Cheerio. Good mornin', sir.
- Good mornin'.

06:05.961 --> 06:08.111
You know what they said

06:08.201 --> 06:13.321
''You'll have to keep yer eyes open now.
He'll take yer breath if you're not careful.''

06:13.401 --> 06:17.872
- l haven't taken owt of yours yet, have l?
- l haven't given you a chance, that's why.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.873
You don't have to.

06:20.961 --> 06:23.953
- Ah, well, don't stand about all day.

07:36.681 --> 07:38.876
- How tha goin' on?
- Not so bad.

07:38.961 --> 07:41.031
Get one of these. Better than walkin'.

07:41.121 --> 07:43.681
Only just. l could go
faster on a kid's scooter.

07:43.761 --> 07:48.357
Tha knows what l always say; third-class
ridin's better than first-class walkin'.

07:48.441 --> 07:50.636
Third-class ridin'? ln that ramshack?

07:50.721 --> 07:55.192
Ramshack? This is one of best models
t'dairy's got. Cheeky! Sithee tomorrow.

07:55.281 --> 07:59.513
- Can only go 20 mile an hour, as it is.
- Tha's got too much rattle, thee.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.996
''Desperate Dan is stronger than all,
but this opponent makes him fall.''

08:36.321 --> 08:39.232
''- Right! Where do you want to fight?
- Right here!''

08:39.321 --> 08:40.037
''SKlD.''

08:40.121 --> 08:42.554
''Down l go again!
What's making me fall?''

08:42.640 --> 08:45.030
''Now's my chance to -
jump on his chest!''

08:45.121 --> 08:45.997
''THUD.''

08:46.081 --> 08:48.197
''You won't catch me out this time,
you braggart!''

08:48.281 --> 08:50.431
''A sock in the midriff
will settle your game!''

08:50.521 --> 08:51.556
''SPLASH.''

08:51.641 --> 08:53.916
''What's this on my face?
Why, it's grease!''

08:54.001 --> 08:57.152
''- Give me that tube back!
- That's how he kept making me slip!''

08:57.241 --> 08:59.880
''He was squirting
invisible grease under my feet!''

08:59.961 --> 09:02.873
''You dirty twister!
lt's time somebody taught you a lesson!''

09:02.961 --> 09:05.316
''- Take that!
- CRASH!''

09:05.401 --> 09:08.598
''- Where did he end up?
- ln the middle of next week, Uncle Dan!''

09:25.641 --> 09:28.235
- Evenin'.
- l told yer it wouldn't take me long.

09:28.321 --> 09:30.596
What did you do?
Throw 'em over the gates?

09:30.681 --> 09:35.914
- l know some short cuts ont' way back.
- l'll bet you do! Over other folk's property.

09:37.801 --> 09:41.271
How many times d'yer want
tellin' where to put that bag?

09:45.321 --> 09:47.676
- Time is it?
- Time you were at school.

09:47.761 --> 09:48.989
ls it that late?

09:49.081 --> 09:52.551
l wouldn't be your teacher
for all the coal in Barnsley.

09:55.001 --> 09:57.720
Oh, Mr Porter! Watch it, Mr Porter.

09:57.801 --> 10:01.032
Yer clumsy young bugger!
What yer tryin' to do? Kill me?

10:01.121 --> 10:03.112
l lost me balance.

10:04.761 --> 10:08.037
l wouldn't put it past yer, either.
l fair felt me heart go then.

10:08.121 --> 10:11.113
Just sit down here and
relax a couple o' minutes.

10:11.841 --> 10:13.957
Are yer all right now?

10:14.041 --> 10:17.033

10:34.041 --> 10:36.236
German Bight.

10:38.961 --> 10:41.350

- l didn't mean to, sir.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.592
Stand up, lad. What did you say?

10:44.681 --> 10:48.310
- German Bight, sir.
- He's daft, sir.

10:48.401 --> 10:51.154
- ls this your ridiculous idea of a joke?
- No, sir.

10:51.241 --> 10:54.517
- What is the idea, then?
- When you said ''Fisher'', sir.

10:54.601 --> 10:57.035
- What about it?
- Fisher. German Bight.

10:57.121 --> 11:00.909
lt's the shipping forecast, sir.
Fisher. German Bight. Cromarty.

11:01.001 --> 11:03.834
l like to hear it every night, sir.
l like t'names.

11:03.921 --> 11:08.631
So you thought you'd enlighten me and
the class with your idiotic information?

11:08.721 --> 11:11.440
- No, sir.
- Making a mess of my register.

11:11.521 --> 11:14.081
- lt just came out.
- And so did you, Casper.

11:14.161 --> 11:16.629

11:23.601 --> 11:26.877

besides Bridges and Fisher?

11:26.961 --> 11:29.395
Any girls?

11:29.481 --> 11:32.518
Right. Now, then,
it's time you were off to assembly.

11:32.601 --> 11:35.161
One row at a time. This one, stand.

11:37.361 --> 11:39.556
Move forward.

11:43.321 --> 11:45.789

11:48.921 --> 11:54.120

Excuses!

12:12.961 --> 12:14.952
(dogs barking)

12:28.361 --> 12:30.750
What do you want

12:30.841 --> 12:32.115
Get your Mac up.

12:32.201 --> 12:35.398
Hey, he's fast asleep.

12:35.481 --> 12:38.359

12:52.041 --> 12:55.078
- l'm not gettin' him up.
- He said l had to get him up.

12:55.161 --> 12:58.631
He's fast asleep and he's not goin',
so just get off with yer.

14:25.841 --> 14:27.832
(wood pigeon flies off)

16:30.441 --> 16:33.399
- Now, then. What's tha doin'?
- Nowt.

16:33.481 --> 16:35.756
Bugger off, then. lt's private property.

16:35.841 --> 16:38.719

- What kestrel's nest?

16:38.801 --> 16:41.474
- Up wall.
- No nest up there, so off tha goes.

16:41.561 --> 16:43.950
There is. l've seen 'em come out.

16:47.241 --> 16:49.596

16:49.681 --> 16:52.832
- They're young 'uns.
- Nowt to go up for, then, is there?

16:52.921 --> 16:56.516
Can l come to t'bottom, then?
Never seen a kestrel's nest before.

16:56.601 --> 16:58.592
Come on, then.

17:05.161 --> 17:07.277
There it is. That big hole.

17:07.361 --> 17:10.637
- lt's nested there for donkey's years now.
- And l never knew.

17:10.721 --> 17:14.953
- No, there's not many that does.
- Been watchin' from t'wood there.

17:15.040 --> 17:17.601
Goes onto t'post, then hovers,

17:17.681 --> 17:22.435
then swoops down onto t'prey,
carries it off to t'young 'uns. Looks great.

17:22.521 --> 17:24.796
l've been gonna knock
that wall down for ages.

17:24.881 --> 17:28.430
- What for?
- lt's dangerous. l won't let her play near.

17:28.521 --> 17:31.638
- lf l lived round here, l'd train a young 'un.
- Would yer?

17:31.721 --> 17:33.837
Yer can train 'em.

17:33.921 --> 17:35.912
Do yer know how?

17:36.521 --> 17:40.150
- Do you know?
- No. There's not many that does.

17:40.241 --> 17:43.517
They're hard to train.
lf they're not kept properly, it's criminal.

17:43.601 --> 17:46.274
- Do yer know anybody who's kept 'em?
- One or two.

17:46.361 --> 17:50.639
But, er, they had to let 'em go
because they're hard to train.

17:50.721 --> 17:53.679
Where can l find out about 'em, then?

17:53.761 --> 17:57.993
Well, probably t'public library.
They'll have some books on 'em.

17:58.081 --> 17:59.799
- Where's that?
- Down int' city.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.351
Hey, are you a member?

18:02.441 --> 18:04.909
- What do yer mean?
- Are you a member of the library?

18:05.001 --> 18:07.754
l don't know about that.
l only want a book on falconry.

18:07.841 --> 18:10.355
You have to be a member
to take a book out.

18:10.441 --> 18:13.911
- l only want one.
- Have you filled one of these forms in?

18:18.401 --> 18:20.119
- No.
- You're not a member, then.

18:20.201 --> 18:23.193
You'll have to take one of these home
for your father to sign.

18:23.281 --> 18:26.671
- Me dad's away.
- You can wait till he comes back home.

18:26.761 --> 18:31.198
- l don't mean that. l mean he's left home.
- l see. Your mother'll have to sign it.

18:31.281 --> 18:34.557
Ar, but she's at work
and she'll not be home till tea time.

18:34.641 --> 18:36.472
There's no rush, is there?

18:36.561 --> 18:38.950
l've never broke a book.
l haven't tore it, or...

18:39.041 --> 18:42.750
Look at your hands. They're filthy.
We'll end up with dirty books that way.

18:42.841 --> 18:47.517
- l don't ready dirty books.
- l hope you don't. You're not old enough.

18:47.921 --> 18:51.152
Me mam knows someone who
works here. That'll help, won't it?

18:51.241 --> 18:54.199
No, not at all.
You still have to have the back signed.

18:54.281 --> 18:57.353
To be a member, you'll have
to have somebody over 21

18:57.441 --> 19:00.080
who is on the borough
electoral roll to sign it.

19:00.161 --> 19:02.550
- l'm over 21 .
- You're not over 21 .

19:02.641 --> 19:05.439
- Ar, but l vote.
- You don't vote. You're not...

19:05.521 --> 19:08.160
l vote for me mam.
She dun't like votin', so l do it.

19:08.441 --> 19:12.878
- Just have to wait for it, won't you?
- Where would l find a book? ln a shop?

19:12.961 --> 19:16.590
You'd have to go down the street.
There's a second-hand bookshop there.

19:43.561 --> 19:46.439
- (woman) Hello. Can l help you?
- (man) Yes.

19:46.521 --> 19:52.357
l'm rather interested in Noël Coward's
autobiography, Present lndicative.

20:31.001 --> 20:34.073
- What's tha got this for? Tha can't read.
- Give us it here.

20:34.161 --> 20:37.198
Get off! Falconry?
What's tha want to know about falconry?

20:37.281 --> 20:39.192
Give it here!

20:39.281 --> 20:41.511
- Where've yer got this from?
- l've lent it.

20:41.601 --> 20:44.354
Stole it, more like.
Where've yer got it from?

20:44.441 --> 20:46.432
A shop in town.

20:48.121 --> 20:53.115
You must be crackers. l could understand
if it were money, but chuff me, not a book!

20:55.001 --> 20:56.354
Have it!

20:56.441 --> 20:59.035
Look what yer've done.
l'm lookin' after this book.

20:59.121 --> 21:03.080
- And what better off will yer be?
- A lot. l'm gonna get a kestrel and train it.

21:03.161 --> 21:05.629
Train it? Yer couldn't train a flea.

21:06.641 --> 21:08.836
Anyway, where yer gonna get
a kestrel from?

21:08.921 --> 21:10.752
- l know a nest.
- Yer don't.

21:10.841 --> 21:12.877
- All right, then, l don't.
- Where?

21:12.961 --> 21:14.792
- l'm not tellin'.
- l said, where?

21:14.881 --> 21:17.759
- You're hurtin' me arm!
- Where, then?

21:17.841 --> 21:19.832
Monastery Farm.

21:22.161 --> 21:24.356
Yer could have broke me arm then.

21:24.441 --> 21:27.160
l'll have to see about
goin' round there wi' me gun.

21:27.241 --> 21:30.392
- l'll tell t'farmer on yer.
- Why? What's he got to do with it?

21:30.481 --> 21:32.949
- He protects 'em.
- Protects 'em?

21:33.041 --> 21:36.317
Hawks are a menace to farmers.
They eat all the poultry an' that.

21:36.401 --> 21:39.552
Ar, l know. They dive down
onto t'cows and take 'em away.

21:39.641 --> 21:43.919
- Funny bugger.
- Well, yer talk daft. They're only small.

21:44.001 --> 21:47.232
They eat mice, insects,
and little birds sometimes.

21:47.641 --> 21:52.635
Hope l'll be watchin' a bird tonight. She'll
not have feathers. Not all over, anyway.

22:00.481 --> 22:03.234
- Have you had any tea yet, Billy?
- No.

22:03.321 --> 22:06.313
Well, get some, then.
You where t'pantry is.

22:07.521 --> 22:10.718
- How's yer horses gone on, Jud?
- Not bad. Two winners.

22:10.801 --> 22:13.474
You haven't.
Might be gettin' tret tonight, then.

22:13.561 --> 22:16.712
- Oh, somebody treats you every night.
- Shut it!

22:16.801 --> 22:19.679
And don't you be comin' home
blind drunk again, Jud.

22:19.761 --> 22:23.276
- Why? Are yer entertainin'?
- You're kiddin'.

22:23.361 --> 22:26.717
lf l entertained as much as you,
l shall do all right, shan't l?

22:26.801 --> 22:30.271
What tripe you've been
goin' out with lately. My God!

22:31.961 --> 22:36.352
- Better'n that cripple you bring home.
- What cripple? Reg? He's not a cripple.

22:36.441 --> 22:41.151
Will be if he comes in here tonight. At
least them l go out with are not tightfisted.

22:41.241 --> 22:45.951
Who is? You chuck your bloody money
around like a Scotchman with no arms!

22:46.041 --> 22:49.317
Have to use a spanner to get
a threepenny bit out of his hand.

22:49.401 --> 22:51.312
Aye, because he's comin' wise to you.

22:51.401 --> 22:55.792
Listen, what about him you're goin' wi'?
Tight as a camel's arse in a sandstorm.

22:55.881 --> 22:59.635
Keep yer hand over yer mouth talkin'
about him, cos yer'll get into trouble.

22:59.721 --> 23:02.189
- You're not too big for a hidin'.
- He can't do it.

23:02.281 --> 23:05.830
Who can't? You might find that
he's bigger than what you think.

23:05.921 --> 23:07.957
More chance of gettin' struck by lightnin'.

23:08.041 --> 23:12.592
Shut yer face. l'm fed up of it. lt's every
Saturday night. l get ready, you're at me.

23:12.681 --> 23:15.718
And l always go out in
a bloomin' mess and all upset.

23:16.321 --> 23:19.279
Gettin' too big for yer boots,
thinking you own t'house.

23:19.361 --> 23:21.431
You don't own it yet, yer know.

23:21.521 --> 23:24.957
- No. l will do one day, though, won't l?
- Over my dead body.

23:25.041 --> 23:29.353
- That's what l says, l'll own it one day.
- l'm sick on it, Jud. l am, pig sick.

23:29.441 --> 23:33.229
l work every day, and every Saturday
night l go for a drink and you upset me.

23:33.321 --> 23:36.393
- l don't think l'll go, l'm that fed up.
- l'll not miss yer.

23:36.481 --> 23:38.995
You'll not miss nowt, will you?
You'll be out there.

23:39.081 --> 23:41.072
- Yeah.
- Aye.

23:44.561 --> 23:49.589
By, what a smart-lookin' kid int' mirror.
Some bird's gonna be lucky tonight.

23:49.681 --> 23:52.479
Listen to God's gift to woman.

23:52.561 --> 23:54.836
Fancy buying me
a brandy and pep tonight?

23:54.921 --> 23:57.310
Aye. Hope it keeps fine for yer.

24:03.641 --> 24:07.429
These could have done
with a bit of a polish.

24:07.521 --> 24:10.081
Still, never mind, it's gonna be dark soon.

24:11.161 --> 24:13.834
What you gonna do
with yerself tonight, love?

24:13.921 --> 24:15.957
Read me book.

24:16.041 --> 24:19.397
Oh, look at t'time. Five to seven.
l'm gonna be late again.

24:19.481 --> 24:22.314
Listen, Billy, there's two bob here. Chuck?

24:22.401 --> 24:25.279
Get yerself some pop
and some crisps. D'yer hear?

24:25.361 --> 24:27.158
Yeah.

24:29.841 --> 24:32.639
- And don't still be up when l come in.
- No.

24:33.721 --> 24:35.712
G'night, then.

24:46.761 --> 24:48.956
? l came home unexpectedly

24:49.041 --> 24:51.919
? And caught her crying needlessly

24:52.001 --> 24:54.231
? ln the middle of the day

24:55.921 --> 25:00.392
? And it was in the early spring
when flowers bloom and robins sing

25:00.481 --> 25:02.472
? She went away

25:04.041 --> 25:07.192
? And honey, l miss you

25:08.561 --> 25:11.712
? And l'm bein' good

25:13.121 --> 25:16.272
? And l'd love to be with you

25:17.801 --> 25:22.511
? lf only l could

25:27.361 --> 25:29.158
Folks, thank you.

25:29.241 --> 25:30.879
(applause)

25:30.961 --> 25:32.917
Now a Tremeloes number.

25:33.001 --> 25:35.390
Yer can have a good time up to a point,

25:35.481 --> 25:38.200
but there comes a time
when you want to settle down.

25:38.281 --> 25:41.034
l'm gettin' a bit fed up
of workin' all t'time.

25:41.121 --> 25:44.557
There's plenty of time
to settle down, in't there?

25:44.641 --> 25:47.235
Depends what yer lookin' for, dun't it?

25:49.281 --> 25:53.718
l just like to come home, get me meal,
get a bath, change and out, me.

25:53.801 --> 25:54.836
Not a care int' world.

25:54.921 --> 25:57.719
When you've been married once
and yer marry a wrong 'un,

25:57.801 --> 26:01.191
it makes yer a bit apprehensive
towards gettin'...

26:01.281 --> 26:04.353
Well, you know, don't yer?
Cos he were never good.

26:04.441 --> 26:07.990
But it makes yer a bit more wary
about gettin' married again.

26:08.081 --> 26:10.959
lf she wants to go with a different bloke,
it's not up to me.

26:11.041 --> 26:13.475
She's old enough to know her own mind.

26:13.561 --> 26:15.438
- Well, yeah...
- ..settle down.

26:15.521 --> 26:19.560
You can never tell with Billy. l sit
and wonder sometimes what he will do.

26:19.641 --> 26:23.600
Perhaps if he had been brought up
in a different environment

26:23.681 --> 26:27.151
and had a better education, he would
have made more than what he has.

26:27.241 --> 26:30.995
At the moment, he's hopeless.
He's a hopeless case, in't he?

26:31.081 --> 26:33.311
? Oh, won't you please come back?

26:34.481 --> 26:36.711
? Oh, won't you please come back?

26:42.361 --> 26:45.353
l'm happy as l am.
l doubt if l could be any happier.

26:45.441 --> 26:48.831
My lads have got nowt.
l don't know what they're gonna do.

26:48.921 --> 26:51.594
l don't know whether
our Jud wanted to be a miner.

26:55.721 --> 26:59.634
From my point of view, Reg, when
a woman gets to my age, you've two kids,

26:59.721 --> 27:02.952
you want to be settlin' down
wi' a nice house

27:03.041 --> 27:08.593
and somebody to come home to yer,
and be lookin' after 'em.

27:08.681 --> 27:12.435
- Like l look after you.
- Ar, but you're not married to me.

27:12.521 --> 27:15.638
- Never mind. Giz a kiss.
- Don't be so damned daft!

27:15.721 --> 27:18.189
- He's had too much ale again.
- l haven't.

27:18.281 --> 27:19.680
- Yer have.
- l haven't.

27:19.761 --> 27:22.514
Say, Mam, have you brought
that cripple wi' yer?

27:22.601 --> 27:25.513
Keep it shut. Keep it shut.

27:25.601 --> 27:27.239
Keep it shut, all right?

27:27.361 --> 27:30.751
Say, did everybody hear
about him when he got married?

27:30.841 --> 27:34.629
He got confetti on elastic.
That's how tightfisted he is.

27:36.321 --> 27:38.471
lf he wants trouble, l'll give him trouble.

27:38.561 --> 27:42.270
? Oh, along the road there lives
a guy l'd like you all to know

27:43.401 --> 27:46.632
? He grew a great big marrow
for the little flower show

27:47.201 --> 27:50.671
? He showed it to a lady
who lived just along the way

27:51.281 --> 27:56.275
? And when she saw the size of it
he heard the lady say

27:59.961 --> 28:01.758
? Ooohhh!

28:03.001 --> 28:04.878
? What a beauty!

28:04.961 --> 28:08.192
? Oh, l've never seen one
as big as that before

28:09.121 --> 28:10.600
? Ooohhh!

28:10.681 --> 28:12.478
? What a whopper!

28:12.561 --> 28:14.950
? lt must be 18 inches long or more

28:16.241 --> 28:19.631
? lt's such a lovely colour,
it's nice and round and fat

28:19.881 --> 28:23.078
? Whoever thought a marrow
could grow as big as that?

28:23.841 --> 28:25.832
? Ooohhh!

28:26.801 --> 28:29.076
? Oh, what a beauty

28:29.161 --> 28:31.880
? l've never seen one as big as it before

28:53.961 --> 28:55.758
(coughs)

29:08.921 --> 29:10.912
Billy, are tha asleep?

29:36.441 --> 29:38.636
Bleedin' things.

29:42.681 --> 29:44.956
Now, Billy!

29:45.041 --> 29:47.111
- Give over.
- Billy!

29:47.201 --> 29:49.761
Help me get these bleedin' trousers off.

29:54.721 --> 29:57.189
Come on! Don't be all bleedin' night.

30:01.641 --> 30:04.030
l'm fed up with this bloody game.

30:06.241 --> 30:08.630
lt's every Saturday night alike.

30:09.881 --> 30:12.270
Don't help, will tha?

30:28.201 --> 30:31.511
Get back to sleep, yer... pig.

30:32.161 --> 30:34.072
Hog. Sow.

30:34.161 --> 30:36.470
Yer drunken bastard.

30:36.561 --> 30:40.270
Tha dun't like bein' called a bastard,
does tha? Yer bastard!

30:40.361 --> 30:42.352
Yer pig.

30:43.041 --> 30:45.111
Pig.

30:45.201 --> 30:46.475
Hog.

30:46.561 --> 30:47.755
Sow.

30:47.841 --> 30:50.230
Drunken... bastard.

30:50.521 --> 30:52.751
Bastard. Bastard.

30:52.841 --> 30:54.399
Drunken... pig.

30:54.801 --> 30:57.190
- Pig.
- (groans)

31:01.201 --> 31:03.510
Billy! Billy!

33:44.041 --> 33:46.999
''Three good meals a day
l'll give him for about a fortnight.''

33:47.081 --> 33:50.630
''lf a piece of meat held between
the finger and thumb of the gloved hand

33:50.721 --> 33:55.954
is offered to the hawk, it will probably
bend down and pull at it with its beak.''

34:24.121 --> 34:25.395
C'mon.

34:47.601 --> 34:50.638
''As soon as the hawk
will come a leash length indoors,

34:50.721 --> 34:54.509
she may be tried off a fence
or gatepost out of doors.''

34:54.601 --> 34:59.391
''lt is quite likely that although she was
coming to the fist promptly indoors,

34:59.481 --> 35:01.631
she will now refuse to come at all.''

35:01.721 --> 35:06.715
''She will stand looking around her and
ignoring the meat and fist in front of her.''

35:28.801 --> 35:30.837
''When she will come
a leash length outside,

35:30.921 --> 35:35.199
she can be called greater distances
by means of a creance,

35:35.281 --> 35:38.591
a long cord which is attached
to the hawk to prevent her escaping.''

35:38.681 --> 35:41.673
''With luck,
she will not attempt to fly away.''

35:59.241 --> 36:01.232
Come on, then.

36:05.681 --> 36:08.320
Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

36:08.401 --> 36:10.471
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck. Come on, lass.

36:10.561 --> 36:12.756
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

36:14.321 --> 36:16.881
Come on, Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

36:17.201 --> 36:20.193
Come on, Kes! Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

36:21.321 --> 36:23.789
Come on, then. Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck.

36:25.241 --> 36:27.471
Tck, tck, tck, tck, tck. Come on, Kes.

36:38.721 --> 36:41.110
(? theme from ''Grandstand'')

37:05.321 --> 37:07.881
(all talking at once)

37:07.961 --> 37:11.158
Come on, boys, get ready!

37:11.241 --> 37:13.232
Get ready now, you.

37:14.121 --> 37:16.316
Skiving again, Guthrie.

37:16.401 --> 37:19.074
No, sir. Mr Farthing
has been talking to me.

37:19.161 --> 37:22.198
l'll bet that was stimulating
for him, wasn't it, lad?

37:22.281 --> 37:25.956
- What does that mean, sir?
- The conversation. What do you think?

37:26.041 --> 37:27.918
Does it mean ''stimulate'', sir?

37:28.001 --> 37:33.314
Stimulating, you fool!
S-t-i-m-i-l-a-t-i-n-g. Stimulating.

37:35.201 --> 37:37.920
Come on, get ready.
You're two weeks late already.

37:40.721 --> 37:44.191
You three, get down,
before l come and put yer down.

37:46.681 --> 37:50.720
Casper, what d'you think you're doing?
Get down. Why aren't you changed?

37:50.801 --> 37:54.794
- l've no kit, sir.
- Casper, you make me sick.

37:54.881 --> 37:58.669
Every lesson it's the same old story,
''Please, sir, l've no kit, sir.''

37:58.761 --> 38:04.757
Every lesson for four years, you've
begged, borrowed, skived and scrounged.

38:04.841 --> 38:08.231
Why is it, Casper, when all this lot
can provide kit, you can't?

38:08.321 --> 38:11.199
Don't know. Me mam says
it's a waste of money now l'm leavin'.

38:11.281 --> 38:13.954
You haven't been leaving
the past four years, have you?

38:14.041 --> 38:15.190
No, sir.

38:15.281 --> 38:18.114
- Use your spending money.
- Don't like football, sir.

38:18.201 --> 38:21.398
- What's that got to do with it, Casper?
- Don't know.

38:21.481 --> 38:25.156
- Anyway, l don't get enough.
- Get a job, then, lad. Get a job.

38:25.241 --> 38:27.835
- l've got one, sir.
- They pay you, don't they?

38:27.921 --> 38:31.277
Yeah, but l have to give it to me mam.
l'm payin' me fines, like...

38:31.361 --> 38:35.149
You should keep out of trouble, lad!
Keep out of trouble.

38:35.241 --> 38:39.712
- l haven't bin in trouble since last time.
- l'll get you some kit, Casper.

38:40.481 --> 38:43.200
- Tha's had it now, Casper.
- Shut thi mouth!

38:44.401 --> 38:46.790
Right, Casper. Get into those.

38:48.161 --> 38:49.879
(laughter)

38:49.961 --> 38:52.680
- They'll not fit me.
- You can get into them, can't you?

38:52.761 --> 38:54.240
Yes, sir.

38:54.321 --> 38:57.040
They'll keep your cobblers warm, Casper.

38:58.721 --> 39:02.191
- Take your vest and underpants off.
- Don't wear 'em, sir.

39:03.921 --> 39:07.709
(Tibbut) Casper, tuck 'em in.
Thi privates are showin'.

39:07.801 --> 39:09.678
(boy) The muscleman o' t'year!

39:09.761 --> 39:11.433
(hums)

39:11.681 --> 39:15.390
- He's just come back from Biafra.
- (teacher) Pull them up, Casper!

39:15.481 --> 39:18.393
- Pull them up!
- Like that, sir?

39:18.481 --> 39:21.200
Pull them down, Casper.

39:21.281 --> 39:23.431
You're too daft to laugh at.

39:23.521 --> 39:25.716
Right. They'll do there.

39:25.801 --> 39:30.158
You lot, come on, get changed.
Wasted enough time already.

39:30.241 --> 39:32.835
l'll give you a sample
of my footballing skills.

39:32.921 --> 39:35.993
- (boys groan)
- A rare delight.

39:39.801 --> 39:42.190
(teacher) Watch yourself, Casper!

39:43.681 --> 39:46.070
l won't tell you again, Crossland!

39:46.681 --> 39:48.672
Come on, move.

39:49.441 --> 39:51.671
Off that goal post!

39:51.761 --> 39:54.912
Off that goal post.
l'll be up there in a minute!

39:55.001 --> 39:58.880
Come here, Tibbut.
We'll pick two teams. You're the captain.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.839
Right, line up on the halfway line, quickly.

40:01.921 --> 40:05.550
- l'll have first pick. Paget.
- That's not fair. You'll get t'best players.

40:05.641 --> 40:08.474
D'you wanna play football,
or d'you wanna do some maths?

40:08.561 --> 40:10.472
Paget, then. Come here.

40:10.561 --> 40:11.914
- Speed.
- Walker.

40:12.001 --> 40:13.320
- Clark.
- Crossland.

40:13.401 --> 40:15.517
- Kelsey.
- Rowe.

40:16.801 --> 40:18.996
Er... Clegg.

40:20.241 --> 40:22.277
Bloody hell, l'm frozen already.

40:22.361 --> 40:24.397
- Joyce.
- Birkinshaw.

40:24.481 --> 40:26.711
- Ryder.
- Parker.

40:26.801 --> 40:29.269
- Norton.
- Come on, Parker.

40:30.121 --> 40:32.635
Casper, l've got to have yer. Come on.

40:32.721 --> 40:35.394
Don't act the goat.
Come on, put 'em round your waist.

40:35.481 --> 40:37.278
Now.

40:41.161 --> 40:44.949
Right, we'll play with the wind,
downhill, this way.

40:45.041 --> 40:47.509
Paget, you're inside right. Come on.

40:53.881 --> 40:57.954
- Who are you today, sir? Liverpool?
- Don't you know your club colours?

40:58.041 --> 41:01.511
- Manchester United, this.
- Are you playing Denis Law, striker?

41:01.601 --> 41:05.640
No. Charlton today, lad.
All over the field. Too cold for striker.

41:05.721 --> 41:08.189
Charlton's not as quick
ont' turn as Law, is he?

41:08.281 --> 41:10.556
- You tryin' to tell me about football?
- No. l...

41:10.641 --> 41:14.634
You trying to tell me? Anyway,
Denis Law's in the wash this week.

41:18.961 --> 41:21.953
- Nobody's in goal, sir.
- No goalie, sir.

41:22.041 --> 41:23.997
- Who's in the goals?
- (boys) Casper.

41:24.081 --> 41:27.960
- Casper, what position are you playing?
- Don't know, sir. lnside left?

41:28.041 --> 41:30.953
How can you be inside left
back there, idiot? ln the goals.

41:31.041 --> 41:34.954
- l can't...
- Now's your chance to learn. ln the goals.

41:35.041 --> 41:37.271
Quick about it.

41:37.361 --> 41:41.912
- We're Manchester United. Who are you?
- Spurs, then there's no clash of colours.

41:42.001 --> 41:47.712
Right, then, it's Manchester United versus
Spurs in this cup tie here at Old Trafford.

41:47.801 --> 41:51.271
And it's the fair-haired,
slightly balding Charlton to kick off.

42:03.601 --> 42:06.957
Come on, Speed.
What you playin' at, lad?

42:07.041 --> 42:10.113
Yer should be on the move, lad.
lt was at yer feet!

42:10.201 --> 42:12.431
Cross it, Ryder. Quickly.

42:12.521 --> 42:14.910
Where's t'rest of my team?

42:21.641 --> 42:25.077
Come on, quickly, Casper. l've never
seen such slack work in my life.

42:29.081 --> 42:31.800
- What's that for, sir?
- Slack work, lad. Slack work.

42:31.881 --> 42:34.349
Hit that ball up the field, Parker.

42:36.761 --> 42:38.911
l have to keep this shirt on after.

42:39.001 --> 42:40.719
(teacher) Cross the ball!

42:40.801 --> 42:43.110
And Charlton goes through, and...

42:43.201 --> 42:45.590
Oh, never! Never!

42:47.921 --> 42:49.593
- Penalty!
- Never.

42:49.681 --> 42:52.149
Who do you think you are? Bremner?

42:54.321 --> 42:56.915
- Penalty.
- No, it weren't, sir!

42:57.001 --> 42:58.992
Outside that semicircle.

43:02.441 --> 43:05.911
- Shall l take it, sir?
- l take the penalties on this team.

43:09.841 --> 43:12.309
No one moves till this ball's kicked.

43:16.081 --> 43:18.800
Just watch this, Guthrie. Right, Clegg?

43:22.281 --> 43:25.512
- (cheering)
- You moved. You moved. Put it back.

43:25.601 --> 43:27.592
(boys protest)

43:32.641 --> 43:34.438
Penalty.

43:35.681 --> 43:38.070
Behind the 18-yard line.

43:39.481 --> 43:42.473
Tha better save it, Cleggy!
Else l'll drop tha.

43:45.361 --> 43:47.829
- He moved!
- l didn't move, sir.

43:47.921 --> 43:50.310
The referee's decision is final.

44:05.641 --> 44:10.635
- You should have done it the first time.
- And that, boys, is how to take a penalty.

44:11.361 --> 44:13.750
Look one way and kick the other.

44:15.081 --> 44:16.719
Come on, Tibbut, lad.

44:16.801 --> 44:20.271
And Bobby Charlton has
equalised for Manchester United,

44:20.361 --> 44:22.272
and the score is one goal each.

44:27.881 --> 44:32.272
That fat twat!
He wants bleedin' milkin'. That big fat git!

44:33.241 --> 44:36.153
What did you say? What did you say?

44:36.241 --> 44:39.392
- Nowt, sir.
- Get off! ln that changin' room! Get off!

44:39.481 --> 44:41.949
- l didn't say nowt, sir.
- Off!

44:42.841 --> 44:47.278
- l won't tolerate that on a football pitch.
- (Guthrie) That's our captain, sir.

44:47.361 --> 44:50.831
l don't care who he is.
You play this game like gentlemen.

44:52.201 --> 44:54.192
Right inside!

44:56.601 --> 44:58.990
An early bath for you, lad.

45:01.561 --> 45:04.917
- l'll bounce the ball up.
- lt's not fair! They never get sent off!

45:05.001 --> 45:09.631
- l shall be up there in a minute!
- They never get sent off, sir.

45:10.961 --> 45:12.952
Off!

45:20.961 --> 45:23.350
What d'you think you two are doing?

45:25.881 --> 45:28.270
- What are you doing?
- Practising, sir.

45:28.961 --> 45:31.350
Show me what you're doing.

45:56.201 --> 45:57.873
(blows whistle)

45:57.961 --> 45:59.952
- Casper!
- (laughter)

46:01.401 --> 46:05.155
Casper, what do you think you are, lad?
An ape?

46:05.241 --> 46:08.472
- All he needs now is a banana.
- Get down. l'll make you red hot.

46:12.121 --> 46:14.191
(applause)

46:14.281 --> 46:16.795
Thank you. Now, for my next trick...

46:16.881 --> 46:20.669
l'll show you a trick! Get back in that goal!

46:26.681 --> 46:30.276
- What's up?
- That hurt. That ball, it's hard as iron.

46:30.361 --> 46:32.750
Ar, l know. lt's like a stone, innit?

46:33.601 --> 46:37.196
- l'm bloody freezin'.
- My feet are like blocks o' ice.

46:37.321 --> 46:40.154
Me knees, look at 'em. They're goin' pale.

46:40.241 --> 46:42.709
Look at t'colour. lt's gone white.

46:43.281 --> 46:45.351
Oh, l wish l'd brought a note.

47:04.841 --> 47:08.117
- Great goal, that, sir.
- l'll give yer ''great goal'', lad.

47:08.201 --> 47:12.592
- Spurs into the sixth round of t'Cup.
- Sixth round? l'll give you six of the best.

47:12.681 --> 47:15.275
- Lost again, sir?
- Fetch my tracksuit.

47:15.361 --> 47:18.353
- Better luck next time.
- Disgusting!

47:26.961 --> 47:29.429
- ln a hurry, Casper?
- l have to get home, sir.

47:29.521 --> 47:31.477
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

47:31.561 --> 47:33.597
- Forgotten something?
- No, sir.

47:33.681 --> 47:35.672
- Are you sure?
- Yes, sir.

47:36.921 --> 47:39.389
- What about the showers?
- l've had one, sir.

47:41.881 --> 47:44.759
- You can ask any of 'em, sir.
- l'll just do that.

47:45.881 --> 47:48.156
- Have you seen him have a shower?
- No, sir.

47:48.241 --> 47:50.118
- Have you?
- No, sir.

47:50.201 --> 47:52.192
- Have you?
- No, sir.

47:54.921 --> 47:57.196
- Have you seen him have a shower?
- Who, sir?

47:57.281 --> 47:59.590
- Casper.
- When, sir?

47:59.681 --> 48:02.753
- Just now. Has he had a shower?
- Had a shower, sir?

48:02.841 --> 48:04.718
Has Casper had a shower?

48:04.801 --> 48:07.713
What you fooling about at, lad?
Has Casper had a shower?

48:07.801 --> 48:11.271
- l don't think so, sir.
- Speed, you'll get what Casper just had.

48:12.241 --> 48:16.200
No one's seen you have a shower,
Casper. Cos you haven't had one.

48:16.401 --> 48:20.155
- Me mam says l ain't to have a shower.
- Come here. What's your mother say?

48:20.241 --> 48:23.233
l ain't to have a shower, sir.
l've got a cold.

48:23.321 --> 48:26.552
- Where's your note, then?
- Can l bring it this afternoon, sir?

48:26.641 --> 48:29.109
That's no good, lad. l want one now.

48:29.201 --> 48:32.398
Any boy wishing to be excused
physical education, or showers,

48:32.481 --> 48:36.759
must, at the time of the lesson,
produce a sealed letter of explanation

48:36.841 --> 48:39.639
signed by one of his parents
or his legal guardian.

48:39.721 --> 48:42.394
- Go on, sir, let me go home.
- You can go, lad.

48:42.481 --> 48:44.949
Hey, come here.
When you've had a shower.

48:46.641 --> 48:49.075
- l haven't a towel, sir.
- Borrow one.

48:49.161 --> 48:52.631
- Nobody'll lend me one.
- Have a drip-dry, then. Shower, come on.

48:55.001 --> 48:56.912
- MacDowall.
- Sir?

48:57.001 --> 48:58.798
Come here, lad.

48:58.881 --> 49:02.237
Come here. What's this?

49:02.321 --> 49:04.312
Our dog did it, sir.

49:05.441 --> 49:07.159
- Your dog did it?
- Aye.

49:07.241 --> 49:09.835
lt bit me while l were fightin' it last night.

49:11.281 --> 49:13.749
- A dog wearing nylons, lads.
- (laughter)

49:21.561 --> 49:23.552
Bloody heck!

49:29.241 --> 49:31.232
- Still in a hurry?
- Can l go now, sir?

49:31.321 --> 49:33.755
- Have a proper wash.
- l've had one, sir.

49:33.841 --> 49:36.878
- ln the shower, lad. ln the shower.
- l've got to get home.

49:36.961 --> 49:38.952
ln the shower.

49:40.841 --> 49:43.401
Ryder, Speed, come here.

49:43.481 --> 49:45.949
Yes, you two. Come on.

49:46.041 --> 49:48.509
Stay here and see that
he doesn't come out.

49:48.601 --> 49:50.956
- Do what, sir?
- l said, stay there.

49:51.041 --> 49:53.430
See that he doesn't come out.

50:00.681 --> 50:03.673
Agh! Sir! lt's gone cold!

50:04.481 --> 50:09.271
Got a sweat on, Casper? l thought you
might need a cooler after your exertions.

50:09.361 --> 50:14.833
lt's not right, sir. l'll catch me death
of cold in here. lt's not right.

50:14.921 --> 50:18.152
Was it right when you
let that goal in deliberately?

50:21.841 --> 50:24.435
- Can't we go for us dinners?
- No, you can stay there.

50:24.521 --> 50:27.991
- We're servers.
- l don't care. They can serve themselves.

50:30.241 --> 50:32.835
You shouldn't put me in goal.
You know l'm useless.

50:32.921 --> 50:35.310
Now's your chance to learn.

50:35.401 --> 50:38.916
Shall we let him out, sir?
He'll catch his death of cold.

50:39.001 --> 50:42.073
- He'll catch pneumonia.
- l don't care what he gets.

50:42.161 --> 50:44.959
lf he thinks l'm running
my blood to water for 90 minutes,

50:45.041 --> 50:49.432
for him to deliberately throw the game
away, he's got another think coming.

50:51.961 --> 50:53.997
Sir, we've got to go for us dinner.

51:00.841 --> 51:04.516
- (teacher) Get down!
- He looks like a bleedin' snake!

51:04.601 --> 51:07.069
(teacher) Think yourself lucky.

51:07.801 --> 51:09.792
(cheering)

52:22.681 --> 52:24.797
- 'Ey up, Jud. How yer doin'?
- Rough, man.

52:24.881 --> 52:28.078
Why? You should be on top of the world
on a day like today.

52:28.161 --> 52:31.153
Another ten minutes
and l'll be at t'bottom of it.

53:42.281 --> 53:47.560
? Only, O Lord, in Thy dear love

53:47.641 --> 53:53.557
? Fit us for perfect rest above

53:54.001 --> 53:59.155
? And help us this and every day

53:59.241 --> 54:07.114
? To live more nearly as we pray

54:07.201 --> 54:12.753
? Amen

54:18.241 --> 54:23.713
This morning's reading is taken from
Matthew, chapter 18, verses 10-1 4.

54:24.281 --> 54:27.159
''Never despise one of these little ones,
l tell you.''

54:27.241 --> 54:29.391
''They have their guardian angels
in heaven

54:29.481 --> 54:32.917
who look continually
on the face of my heavenly father.''

54:33.001 --> 54:36.516
''Suppose a man has a hundred sheep.
lf one of them strays,

54:36.601 --> 54:39.274
does he not leave
the other 99 on the hillside

54:39.361 --> 54:41.591
and go in search of the one that strayed?''

54:41.681 --> 54:44.593
''And if he should find it, l tell you this,

54:44.681 --> 54:48.993
he is more delighted over that sheep
than over the 99 that never strayed.''

54:49.081 --> 54:51.800
''ln the same way,
it is not your heavenly father's will

54:51.881 --> 54:56.671
that one of these little ones should be
lost.'' Here ends this morning's reading.

55:00.241 --> 55:01.594
(coughing)

55:01.681 --> 55:03.672
Stop! Stop that infernal coughing.

55:03.761 --> 55:09.233
Every morning alike. Clear your throats
on the way to school, not here.

55:09.321 --> 55:12.916
Sounds more like a dirt track
than an assembly hall.

55:15.081 --> 55:16.799
(coughs)

55:16.881 --> 55:20.078
Come out! Come out, that boy!

55:20.161 --> 55:24.393
Who coughed? Mr Hesketh,
somewhere near you, l think.

55:24.481 --> 55:26.392
Fetch that boy out!

55:26.481 --> 55:28.756
MacDowall, it was you.
You were coughing.

55:28.841 --> 55:30.752
- lt weren't.
- Yes, it was. l heard you.

55:30.841 --> 55:32.559
- lt weren't, sir.
- Don't argue.

55:32.641 --> 55:35.360
- lt weren't me, honest.
- Headmaster's study.

55:35.441 --> 55:38.353
MacDowall! l might have known!
Get to my office!

55:38.441 --> 55:41.433
- lt weren't me, sir.
- And heaven help you.

55:44.121 --> 55:46.191
We will now say the Lord's Prayer.

55:46.761 --> 55:49.229
Hands together, eyes closed.

55:49.321 --> 55:50.879
Our Father...

55:50.961 --> 55:52.792
(pupils) Our Father

55:52.881 --> 55:56.840
which art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

55:57.961 --> 56:00.270
Thy kingdom come.

56:00.361 --> 56:02.431
Thy will be done...

56:09.801 --> 56:12.759
- Does he bite yer?
- He's had a little kid's hand off nearly.

56:12.841 --> 56:16.629
Has it? My, my, my!
What's it fastened on? A wire?

56:16.721 --> 56:20.191
Aye. lt's broke this off an' all.
Just darted at t'kid and got him.

56:20.281 --> 56:23.956
Well, l don't know, l'm sure.
ls that what you've got t'glove on for?

56:24.041 --> 56:26.839
- Yeah. Just in case it gets me.
- Aye. Aye.

56:27.761 --> 56:29.479
- What d'yer call it?
- Kes.

56:29.561 --> 56:33.349
Kes? Aye. He is a nice bird.

56:36.841 --> 56:38.638
l shouldn't like to handle him.

56:38.721 --> 56:42.191
Casper! Casper! Up, lad! On yer feet!

56:43.001 --> 56:46.038
- You were asleep, weren't you, Casper?
- l don't know, sir.

56:46.121 --> 56:48.635
l know! You were. You were asleep.

56:48.721 --> 56:51.189
Why were you asleep,
you irreverent scoundrel?

56:51.281 --> 56:53.192
- Don't know, sir.
- l know why!

56:53.281 --> 56:56.637
You were roaming the streets at night
instead of being home in bed.

56:56.721 --> 57:01.715
See me in my office afterwards! l'll give
you something to sleep about! Sit!

57:03.801 --> 57:05.598
Here are the announcements.

57:05.681 --> 57:10.675
The youth employment officer will be
here today to meet the Easter leavers.

57:11.001 --> 57:12.992
Your parents should have been told.

57:13.081 --> 57:17.074
lf any boy has forgotten and thinks his
parents may wish to attend his interview,

57:17.161 --> 57:22.155
then he can consult the list on the main
notice board for the approximate times.

57:23.441 --> 57:28.071
And finally, for three members
of the smokers' union

57:28.161 --> 57:31.392
caught yesterday behind
the games storeroom,

57:31.481 --> 57:35.076
there will be a meeting
with me after assembly,

57:35.161 --> 57:39.313
when l will be pleased to see
and hear them pay their dues.

57:39.521 --> 57:42.433
He'd better not stick me.
l'm fetchin' me father up if he does.

57:42.521 --> 57:45.513
What yer bringin' yer father down for?
He don't do nowt.

57:45.601 --> 57:48.161
- How d'yer mean?
- Last time, he got stick an' all.

57:48.241 --> 57:50.516
Shut up, will tha? l'm sick of hearin' yer.

57:50.601 --> 57:52.751
When he came,
they were laughin' at him.

57:52.841 --> 57:54.991
- Yer what?
- Yeah. Weren't they?

57:55.801 --> 57:58.269
Don't say that about my father, right?

58:00.441 --> 58:03.319
He's not gonna beat me, anyhow.

58:03.401 --> 58:06.359
- What do you want?
- l've got a message for Mr Gryce.

58:06.441 --> 58:08.238
Better wait in the queue, then.

58:08.321 --> 58:11.836
He likes to keep yer waitin'.
He thinks it makes it worse.

58:11.921 --> 58:15.072
He can keep me till four o'clock.
l'm not bothered.

58:15.161 --> 58:17.755
l'd rather the cane than do lessons.

58:17.841 --> 58:20.036
Come here, you.

58:20.121 --> 58:22.919
Save us these till after
we come outta Gryce's.

58:23.001 --> 58:24.559
He'll think l'm a smoker.

58:24.641 --> 58:28.680
He'll not search you but he'll search us,
and if he finds 'em, we'll get two extra.

58:28.761 --> 58:31.116
- l don't want 'em.
- You want some fist instead?

58:31.201 --> 58:34.398
- You want to take them?
- You'd better, lad.

58:35.681 --> 58:38.832
OK. But if l get caned,
you give me something.

58:38.921 --> 58:41.719
Aye. Some fist if yer don't.

58:44.121 --> 58:46.681
'Ey up, he's here - Gryce Pudding.

58:47.201 --> 58:49.351
Single file.

58:49.441 --> 58:51.352
Right. You lost, lad?

58:51.441 --> 58:54.433
- Please, sir, l'm going...
- On yer way, form room.

58:57.081 --> 58:59.754
You lot, inside.

59:03.281 --> 59:05.511
Same old faces.

59:05.681 --> 59:08.673
Same old faces.

59:09.361 --> 59:11.511
Ten years this school's been opened,

59:11.601 --> 59:16.356
and ten years have we seen, after
every assembly, a line of boys here,

59:16.441 --> 59:18.875
and the same old faces.

59:18.961 --> 59:22.954
- Sir, l've got a message...
- Shut up. Don't interrupt. Close the door.

59:25.081 --> 59:28.073
l've taught in this city for over 30 years.

59:28.241 --> 59:32.393
l taught some of your parents -
your father, MacDowall -

59:32.481 --> 59:34.790
in the old slum schools in the city,

59:34.881 --> 59:39.671
before they built this fine estate,
and this wonderful school.

59:40.641 --> 59:43.997
Things are no better now
than they were then.

59:44.081 --> 59:46.595
l just can't understand this generation.

59:46.681 --> 59:49.354
l thought l knew something
about young people.

59:49.441 --> 59:52.592
l should be able to,
you know, with my experience.

59:52.681 --> 59:54.751
But with you, no.

59:54.841 --> 59:59.232
lt just seems a complete
waste of money and a waste of time.

59:59.641 --> 01:00:02.201
And it's a waste of time
talking to you now.

01:00:02.281 --> 01:00:04.511
- You're not listening, are you?
- Yes, sir.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:07.274
You're not! Crossland,
you're not listening, are you?

01:00:07.361 --> 01:00:09.317
- l am, sir.
- None of you are listening!

01:00:09.401 --> 01:00:11.869
Look at that glazed expression
on your faces.

01:00:11.961 --> 01:00:16.000
You never listen!
Yours is the generation that never listens!

01:00:16.081 --> 01:00:18.549
Cos we can never tell you anything.

01:00:19.361 --> 01:00:22.159
You're the sophisticated ones,

01:00:22.241 --> 01:00:25.313
with all your music, and your gear.

01:00:25.401 --> 01:00:28.791
But, you know, it's superficial.
lt's a sheen.

01:00:28.881 --> 01:00:31.873
There's nothing solid
or worthwhile underneath.

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:34.555
And why do l know this?

01:00:34.641 --> 01:00:38.793
Why do l know there's been
no advance in discipline or decency,

01:00:38.881 --> 01:00:40.997
or morals or manners?

01:00:41.081 --> 01:00:46.439
Why do l know it? Because l still
have to use this to you boys every day.

01:00:46.681 --> 01:00:51.197
Why? ln the '20s and '30s,
l could understand it.

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:52.999
They were hard times,

01:00:53.081 --> 01:00:56.471
but they produced qualities in people
that you lot will never have.

01:00:56.561 --> 01:00:59.314
l can be stopped in the street
by someone l taught then.

01:00:59.401 --> 01:01:04.077
We'll talk about the old days, and we'll
laugh about the thrashings l gave him.

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:06.629
But what do l get from you lot?

01:01:07.921 --> 01:01:11.311
A honk from a greasy,
pimply-faced youth

01:01:11.721 --> 01:01:14.519
sitting at the wheel
of a big second-hand car.

01:01:15.361 --> 01:01:18.956
l don't know. l just don't know.

01:01:19.721 --> 01:01:24.511
No guts! No backbone!
Nothing to commend you whatsoever.

01:01:24.601 --> 01:01:27.399
Mere fodder for the mass media.

01:01:31.321 --> 01:01:35.394
And so, until someone
produces a better solution,

01:01:35.481 --> 01:01:37.870
l'll continue to use this cane,

01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:42.671
knowing fully well that you'll be
back for it time and time and time again.

01:01:44.321 --> 01:01:48.109
You smokers will go out of here
with your hands ringing.

01:01:48.201 --> 01:01:52.353
Will it stop you smoking? You're already
looking forward to smoking at break.

01:01:52.441 --> 01:01:54.432
- What are you grinning about?
- Not grinnin'.

01:01:54.521 --> 01:01:57.831
You are! l'll bet you're already
thinking about smoking at break.

01:01:57.921 --> 01:01:59.752
Empty your pockets.

01:01:59.841 --> 01:02:04.278
l bet they're loaded with cigarettes.
Come on, all of you, empty your pockets.

01:02:06.881 --> 01:02:09.270
- Please, sir...
- Quiet. Empty your pockets.

01:02:09.361 --> 01:02:11.591
- You don't understand.
- Empty your pockets.

01:02:12.161 --> 01:02:13.958
Disgusting!

01:02:16.721 --> 01:02:18.598
Please, sir.

01:02:18.681 --> 01:02:20.990
You again? You again?!

01:02:21.081 --> 01:02:23.993
- Yes, sir.
- Empty your pockets.

01:02:24.081 --> 01:02:28.313
- But, sir, l've got a message from Mrs...
- Empty your pockets!

01:02:30.281 --> 01:02:32.431
l don't believe it.

01:02:33.961 --> 01:02:36.111
l don't believe this.

01:02:38.121 --> 01:02:42.194
Empty your pockets, lad.
Empty your pockets when you're told!

01:02:42.281 --> 01:02:44.397
Come on, lad.

01:02:44.481 --> 01:02:46.278
Ah!

01:02:47.881 --> 01:02:51.396
A regular little cigarette factory,
aren't you?

01:02:51.481 --> 01:02:53.472
Yes, sir.

01:02:57.401 --> 01:02:59.790
Put that rubbish away!

01:03:21.241 --> 01:03:24.199
Now l hope it's going to be
a lesson to you.

01:03:24.281 --> 01:03:27.034
l don't suppose for one minute it will be.

01:03:27.121 --> 01:03:31.353
l don't doubt before the end of the week
you'll be back in here again

01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:33.909
for exactly the same crime, smoking.

01:03:35.201 --> 01:03:39.080
Perhaps, once in a while, it might sink in.

01:03:39.161 --> 01:03:42.233
- Yes, sir.
- That you're wasting your money,

01:03:42.321 --> 01:03:44.312
that it's your money you're burning,

01:03:44.401 --> 01:03:48.155
and it's your hands that get caned
when you come in here.

01:03:51.361 --> 01:03:54.558
Good morning. Entry of the gladiators.
Where have you been?

01:03:54.641 --> 01:03:56.791
- Been to see Mr Gryce, sir.
- For the stick?

01:03:56.881 --> 01:03:58.280
- Yes, sir.
- How many?

01:03:58.361 --> 01:04:00.352
- Two.
- Did it hurt?

01:04:00.441 --> 01:04:03.592
- Not bad.
- Right. Hope it didn't.

01:04:04.081 --> 01:04:06.072
Go on, sit down.

01:04:08.161 --> 01:04:10.117
Right now, fact.

01:04:10.201 --> 01:04:13.591
Anne, tell me what a fact is.

01:04:13.681 --> 01:04:15.558
Don't give me a fact.

01:04:15.641 --> 01:04:20.317
You know, don't say that Guthrie's
got a tatty head or anything like that.

01:04:20.401 --> 01:04:24.314
(Anne) A fact is something where
you find evidence out, like truth.

01:04:24.961 --> 01:04:27.873
Something that you know
has actually happened.

01:04:27.961 --> 01:04:30.953
This is a fact. All right?
Have you got that clear?

01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:33.680
- (all) Yes, sir.
- All right.

01:04:33.761 --> 01:04:36.833
Tibbut, sit up straight.

01:04:36.921 --> 01:04:39.799
And l want the rest of yer
to look at him - if you can bear it -

01:04:39.881 --> 01:04:42.349
and tell me some facts about Tibbut.

01:04:42.721 --> 01:04:45.519
- Wolstenholme?
- He's always tryin' to go wi' t'lasses.

01:04:45.601 --> 01:04:48.274
- ls he?
- (laughter)

01:04:49.041 --> 01:04:51.430
- He smokes.
- Do l heck!

01:04:51.521 --> 01:04:54.035
- Tha does.
- Get knotted, Guthrie!

01:04:54.121 --> 01:04:57.158
l'm not interested in what
he does out of school hours,

01:04:57.241 --> 01:05:01.234
as long as he doesn't come into
the class smokin' a fag. All right?

01:05:02.401 --> 01:05:05.040
Come on, you people who aren't thinking.

01:05:06.601 --> 01:05:08.080
Right, Julie.

01:05:08.161 --> 01:05:13.155
l want you to think of an incident that's
happened to you sometime in the past,

01:05:13.241 --> 01:05:18.110
that is true, and that you think
will interest the rest of the class. All right?

01:05:18.441 --> 01:05:20.671
Well, er...

01:05:20.761 --> 01:05:23.912
l went to this all-night party yesterday.
And, er...

01:05:26.601 --> 01:05:30.310
about three o'clock,
we were dancin' int' garden -

01:05:31.601 --> 01:05:34.718
me and her and all the rest,
can't mention names -

01:05:34.801 --> 01:05:38.316
and, er, this woman
come across from t'road,

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:40.517
and, er, she tells us to...

01:05:40.601 --> 01:05:44.753
to make less noise,
or she'd fetch t'police.

01:05:44.841 --> 01:05:48.993
So, well... so we said,
let her fetch 'em if she wanted.

01:05:49.081 --> 01:05:51.549
So she fetched 'em.

01:05:53.881 --> 01:05:58.033
Things that have actually happened.
How about another one?

01:05:58.121 --> 01:06:00.191
What about you, Casper?

01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:03.239
- Casper!
- What, sir?

01:06:03.321 --> 01:06:07.280
''What, sir?''
You'd know if you'd been listening.

01:06:07.361 --> 01:06:09.829
What have we just been talking about?

01:06:10.921 --> 01:06:13.560
- Stories, sir?
- What kind of stories?

01:06:16.881 --> 01:06:19.839
- You haven't been listening, have yer?
- Yes. Some of it.

01:06:19.921 --> 01:06:21.912
Some of it?!

01:06:22.681 --> 01:06:24.672
Stand up!

01:06:29.081 --> 01:06:31.390
You're gonna tell us
a story about yourself.

01:06:31.481 --> 01:06:34.951
- l don't know any, sir.
- Well, you stand there till yer do.

01:06:37.841 --> 01:06:42.471
Always somebody, isn't there, eh?
Somebody who wants to be awkward.

01:06:42.561 --> 01:06:46.031
Just won't be interested,
doesn't matter what you do.

01:06:47.281 --> 01:06:49.670
Just like you, Casper.

01:06:52.361 --> 01:06:54.352
Come on.

01:06:55.281 --> 01:06:57.317
l'll give you two minutes

01:06:57.401 --> 01:07:01.189
to think of something, or the whole class
comes back at four o'clock.

01:07:01.281 --> 01:07:04.318
- Come on, don't stand there like a nail.
- He is a nail.

01:07:04.401 --> 01:07:05.595
Come on.

01:07:05.681 --> 01:07:10.152
- l say... tell him.
- (boy) Tell him about the hawk, Casper.

01:07:10.241 --> 01:07:13.790
lf anybody else calls out,
it'll be the last call they make!

01:07:14.521 --> 01:07:17.593
- Speed?
- He's got this hawk. He's mad over it.

01:07:17.681 --> 01:07:21.879
He just goes wi' t'hawk all t'time.
He's crackers over it.

01:07:21.961 --> 01:07:24.953
- Better than thee, anyroad.
- All right, Casper.

01:07:26.121 --> 01:07:28.112
Sit down.

01:07:29.801 --> 01:07:33.680
Now, come on, tell us about this hawk.
Where'd you get it from?

01:07:33.761 --> 01:07:36.355
- l found it, sir.
- Where?

01:07:36.441 --> 01:07:39.160
- lnt' woods.
- Where d'you keep it?

01:07:39.241 --> 01:07:42.039
- ln a shed.
- What do you feed it on?

01:07:42.921 --> 01:07:45.310
Beef. Mice. Birds.

01:07:45.961 --> 01:07:49.556
lsn't it cruel to keep it in a shed?
Wouldn't it be happier flying free?

01:07:49.641 --> 01:07:52.997
l don't keep it int' shed all the time, sir.
l fly it every day.

01:07:53.081 --> 01:07:57.154
- Doesn't it fly away?
- Course it don't fly away. l've trained it.

01:07:57.241 --> 01:08:00.039
Are you gonna tell us about it?
How do you train a hawk?

01:08:00.121 --> 01:08:02.954
You have to be right careful wi' 'em,
sir, right patient.

01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:05.236
You've got to feed 'em
when they're hungry.

01:08:05.321 --> 01:08:08.552
You can only do owt at feedin' time, sir.

01:08:08.641 --> 01:08:11.951
- Yeah?
- Got these jesses on, sir, all t'time.

01:08:12.041 --> 01:08:14.509
- These what?
- Jesses, sir.

01:08:14.601 --> 01:08:16.751
- How do you spell that?
- J-e...

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:20.595
All right. Come out here.
You'd better show us on the board.

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.069
''Jesses''. That's a new word to me.

01:08:23.761 --> 01:08:26.069
Hands up those who've
heard of jesses before?

01:08:26.161 --> 01:08:28.550
Nobody. Go on, write it up there.

01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:35.598
Right. Now tell us what it is.

01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:39.196
They're leather straps, sir.
And they attach to t'bird's feet.

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:43.718
Say l've got t'bird on me hand. Straps
come down there. Then there's t'swivel.

01:08:43.801 --> 01:08:46.189
''Swivel''. Write that on the board.

01:08:50.401 --> 01:08:54.837
- Then you've got your leash.
- ''Leash''. On the board.

01:08:56.241 --> 01:08:58.390
(Billy) l fed it on me hand first.

01:08:58.481 --> 01:09:01.439
Then, when it got to know me,
l fed it on me glove.

01:09:02.001 --> 01:09:06.392
And after a while,
l put it two inches away from its claws.

01:09:06.481 --> 01:09:09.075
And, er... Like that, right?

01:09:09.161 --> 01:09:13.916
lt started to jump for t'meat. When it
started to jump, l could move me hand.

01:09:14.001 --> 01:09:17.595
- Hold your hand up, so we can see.
- l could move me hand away, like,

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.072
to four inches and six inches. And when it
were doin' that, l started it wi' t'leash.

01:09:22.161 --> 01:09:25.790
Do they need water? When you've got
a budgie, you put water in the cage.

01:09:25.881 --> 01:09:28.714
Do they need water like that?

01:09:28.801 --> 01:09:33.272
Well, it, like, has a bath. lt has a bath
right early on int' morning, like.

01:09:34.481 --> 01:09:37.314
When do yer feed it?
How many times a day?

01:09:37.401 --> 01:09:39.995
To start off with,
three or four, to get it plump.

01:09:40.081 --> 01:09:42.231
- You make it sound very exciting.
- lt is.

01:09:42.321 --> 01:09:45.118
Most exciting thing was
when l flew her free first time.

01:09:45.201 --> 01:09:47.395
- Do you wanna hear about that?
- Yes, sir.

01:09:47.481 --> 01:09:49.358
Aye. Come on.

01:09:49.441 --> 01:09:53.593
Well, l'd been using t'creance
for about a week,

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:56.241
and it had been goin' 30 or 40 yards.

01:09:56.321 --> 01:09:59.916
And it says when birds
are goin' 30-40 yards, it says int' book,

01:10:00.001 --> 01:10:02.469
it's time that it can start to fly free.

01:10:04.481 --> 01:10:07.200
Well, l'd been...

01:10:07.281 --> 01:10:12.275
l'd been wantin' to fly it free, but l daren't.
l were frightened it'd fly off or somethin'.

01:10:12.361 --> 01:10:14.591
This had been goin' on
for four or five days.

01:10:14.681 --> 01:10:18.390
And l keep on to missen,
sayin' that ''Fly it free next day.''

01:10:18.481 --> 01:10:23.430
Anyway, l got right mad wi' missen.
l says ''Right, l'm flyin' it free tomorrow.''

01:10:23.521 --> 01:10:25.910
Anyway, that night -
that Friday night it were -

01:10:26.001 --> 01:10:29.789
l didn't feed her up, so that
she'd be sharp set next mornin'.

01:10:30.041 --> 01:10:34.193
And l went to bed that night, Friday night,
and l didn't get an hour's sleep at all.

01:10:34.281 --> 01:10:38.797
l were frightened about t'bird,
that she'd fly off or summat like that.

01:10:38.881 --> 01:10:41.714
Anyway, when t'mornin' came,
l kept on sayin' to missen

01:10:41.801 --> 01:10:45.032
''lf she flies off, she flies off,
and it can't be helped.''

01:10:45.121 --> 01:10:48.318
So l took t'swivel off
and let her hop onto t'post.

01:10:48.401 --> 01:10:52.758
There were nowt stoppin' her, she could
fly off. All that were on her were jesses.

01:10:52.841 --> 01:10:55.674
l thought ''She must fly off.
She's forced to fly off.''

01:10:55.761 --> 01:10:59.151
But she didn't.
She just stood there. l were terrified.

01:10:59.241 --> 01:11:03.792
She was stood there, and l walked off
into t'field, and she were lookin' round,

01:11:03.881 --> 01:11:08.159
and when l got about 70 yards from her,
in middle of t'field,

01:11:08.241 --> 01:11:10.232
l called her.

01:11:11.001 --> 01:11:14.437
''Kes. Kes. Come on, Kes. Come on, then.''

01:11:14.521 --> 01:11:17.718
Nowt happened. So l thought
''l'd better walk back and pick her up.''

01:11:17.801 --> 01:11:22.511
So while l were walkin' back,
l saw her flyin'. She came like a bomb!

01:11:22.601 --> 01:11:26.833
About a yard off t'floor, like lightning,
head still, and you couldn't hear t'wings.

01:11:26.921 --> 01:11:30.197
There weren't a sound from t'wings.
And straight onto t'glove. Wham!

01:11:30.281 --> 01:11:32.670
And she grabbed me for t'meat.

01:11:33.601 --> 01:11:36.354
l were pleased wi' missen,
and l didn't know what to do.

01:11:36.441 --> 01:11:40.275
So l thought l better do it again,
just to prove it weren't luck.

01:11:40.361 --> 01:11:42.829
So l took her back onto t'post,

01:11:44.041 --> 01:11:47.158
and walked up into t'middle of t'field,
and called her again.

01:11:47.241 --> 01:11:52.031
And she came just as good as first time,
straight onto t'glove, grabbin' for t'meat.

01:11:52.121 --> 01:11:56.034
Well, that were it, sir. l'd trained her, sir,
and that were all l could do.

01:11:56.121 --> 01:11:59.511
l think you've done enough.
Well done, Billy. Big hand of applause.

01:11:59.601 --> 01:12:00.795
(applause)

01:12:13.281 --> 01:12:15.078
- Got owt, Casper?
- Nay.

01:12:15.161 --> 01:12:19.837
Tha never has. Tha just cadges. Casper
the Cadger, they ought to call thee.

01:12:19.921 --> 01:12:23.118
- l wouldn't give thee owt if l had.
- l'll give thee summat.

01:12:23.201 --> 01:12:25.590
What tha goin' for?
Don't tha like company?

01:12:25.681 --> 01:12:29.390
They say thi mother does. Tha's
got more uncles than any other kid.

01:12:29.481 --> 01:12:31.392
- Shut thi mouth!
- Make me.

01:12:31.481 --> 01:12:34.757
- Tha wouldn't say that to our Jud.
- Your Jud's nowt.

01:12:34.841 --> 01:12:36.877
What? He's cock of t'estate.

01:12:36.961 --> 01:12:40.431
- l know somebody who could do him.
- Who? Thi father?

01:12:41.321 --> 01:12:44.040
- He in't even thi brother.
- What is he? Me sister?

01:12:44.121 --> 01:12:46.077
They don't even call him Casper.

01:12:46.161 --> 01:12:49.631
Course he's me brother!
We live int' same house, don't we?

01:12:51.241 --> 01:12:53.630
(boys) Get him! Get him!

01:13:00.201 --> 01:13:02.795
(boys shouting)

01:13:02.881 --> 01:13:04.872
(children shout) Fight!

01:13:32.561 --> 01:13:35.029
Right, you lot!
Ten seconds, out of my sight!

01:13:35.121 --> 01:13:37.396
One! Two! Three!

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:46.429
Right, come here, you two. Come on.

01:13:48.081 --> 01:13:50.549
- What's goin' on?
- lt was him, sir. He started it.

01:13:50.641 --> 01:13:53.633
- He's been chuckin' coal.
- Ah, shut up. Shut up!

01:13:54.241 --> 01:13:58.359
lt's always the same tale; somebody
else's fault, nobody's to blame.

01:13:58.441 --> 01:14:01.478
Look at the mess you're in!
Look at the state you've made!

01:14:01.561 --> 01:14:04.678
- Casper, you're not dead yet.
- He will be when l've had him.

01:14:04.761 --> 01:14:10.597
Oh, yes! You're a big lad, aren't yer? He's
just about your size, Casper, isn't he? Eh?

01:14:10.681 --> 01:14:12.717
Pick on somebody your own size.

01:14:12.801 --> 01:14:16.714
What if l rubbed your nose in the coke?
You'd say l was a bully, wouldn't yer?

01:14:16.801 --> 01:14:21.192
And you'd be right. Cos l'm bigger
and stronger than you, aren't l? Eh?

01:14:21.281 --> 01:14:23.841
- l'll fetch me dad.
- Oh, yes. And l'll fetch mine.

01:14:23.921 --> 01:14:26.276
My dad's heavyweight
champion of the world,

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:28.750
so what will your dad do then, eh?

01:14:31.281 --> 01:14:35.752
That's what it's like to be bullied.
You don't like it, do yer?

01:14:35.841 --> 01:14:39.754
You'll like it a bit less if l ever catch
you at it again. Do you understand it?

01:14:39.841 --> 01:14:41.832
Yes, sir.

01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:45.877
Get it shovelled up. Come here a minute.
Have you been smoking?

01:14:45.961 --> 01:14:48.634
- No, sir.
- You have! l can smell it on your breath.

01:14:48.721 --> 01:14:51.713
- No, sir.
- See me afterwards. Get it done. Go on.

01:15:04.641 --> 01:15:05.915
What's it all about?

01:15:06.001 --> 01:15:10.153
He keeps callin' me names, and sayin'
things about me dad and me mam and...

01:15:10.241 --> 01:15:12.675
All right, all right, all right. Calm down.

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:15.350
They all seem to pick on you. Why is it?

01:15:15.441 --> 01:15:17.636
- Don't know.
- ls it because you're a bad 'un?

01:15:17.721 --> 01:15:20.519
Maybe l am sometimes,
but l'm not that bad, sir.

01:15:20.601 --> 01:15:25.391
l know stacks of other kids that's worse
than me, but they seem to get away wi' it.

01:15:27.161 --> 01:15:29.994
Why else do you think, eh?
There must be some reason.

01:15:30.081 --> 01:15:32.276
Well, take this mornin', sir.

01:15:32.361 --> 01:15:35.273
l came in and just dozed off.
l weren't doin' nowt wrong.

01:15:35.361 --> 01:15:39.832
l'd been up since six. l had to do t'papers,
then l had to rush home to look at t'bird,

01:15:39.921 --> 01:15:42.958
and then run to school.
You'd be tired, wouldn't yer, sir?

01:15:43.041 --> 01:15:44.918
l'd be exhausted.

01:15:45.001 --> 01:15:48.789
You shouldn't be caned for that, sir.
And you can't tell Mr Gryce that.

01:15:48.881 --> 01:15:53.671
And this little lad, sir. He'd only brought
a letter from a teacher, and he got t'cane.

01:15:54.481 --> 01:15:57.951
lt's nowt to laugh at, sir.
Afterwards, he was sick as a dog.

01:15:59.201 --> 01:16:02.034
And teachers, sir.
They're not bothered about us, sir.

01:16:02.121 --> 01:16:05.397
lf we're 4C, they think
we're numbskulls, owt like that, sir.

01:16:05.481 --> 01:16:09.872
They're always lookin' at their watches,
to see how long there's left of t'lesson.

01:16:09.961 --> 01:16:13.749
They're not bothered about us,
and we're not bothered about them.

01:16:16.841 --> 01:16:19.071
How are things at home these days?

01:16:19.161 --> 01:16:21.470
All right, sir. Usual, l suppose.

01:16:21.561 --> 01:16:23.836
- Been in trouble with the police recently?
- No, sir.

01:16:23.921 --> 01:16:26.958
Not since l've been
without MacDowall's gang.

01:16:27.041 --> 01:16:30.875
You know, they used to go into t'city
and go into t'coffee bars and t'cinema,

01:16:30.961 --> 01:16:33.634
but since l've been without them
l've been all right.

01:16:33.721 --> 01:16:37.350
- lt's all right now, innit?
- But when there's trouble on estate,

01:16:37.441 --> 01:16:40.274
all the police come to our house.

01:16:40.361 --> 01:16:42.477
Well, l shouldn't worry.

01:16:42.561 --> 01:16:46.349
ln a couple of weeks you'll be starting
your new job, gettin' new friends.

01:16:46.441 --> 01:16:50.992
Lookin' forward to that, are yer?
Eh? Have you got a job?

01:16:51.081 --> 01:16:53.356
No, sir. l've got to see
t'employment bloke.

01:16:53.441 --> 01:16:55.875
- What sort of job do you want?
- Anything'll do me.

01:16:55.961 --> 01:16:59.192
But you want something that
you're interested in, don't you?

01:16:59.281 --> 01:17:02.990
- l'll take what l've got.
- l thought you wanted to leave school.

01:17:03.081 --> 01:17:05.549
- Not bothered.
- Thought you didn't like school.

01:17:05.641 --> 01:17:09.998
l don't, but it dun't mean to say l'll like
work. Still, l'll get paid for not likin' it.

01:17:10.081 --> 01:17:12.993
- That's one thing.
- l suppose it is.

01:17:13.081 --> 01:17:16.915
l might be able to save up and buy
a goshawk. l've been readin' about 'em.

01:17:17.001 --> 01:17:19.310
Have yer? When do you fly
this hawk o' yours?

01:17:19.401 --> 01:17:21.073
- Dinner times.
- Where?

01:17:21.161 --> 01:17:23.629
- Just outside our house, sir.
- Wood Lane?

01:17:23.721 --> 01:17:27.191
- Yeah, it is, sir.
- l'll come round, then. lf it's OK.

01:17:29.281 --> 01:17:31.749
Go on, then. Get yourself cleaned up.

01:18:36.961 --> 01:18:41.193
''Five bob double.
Crackpot. Tell Him He's Dead.''

01:18:41.281 --> 01:18:43.078
''Jud.''

01:18:44.161 --> 01:18:46.152
Bloody hellfire!

01:19:14.481 --> 01:19:16.870
Kes! Come on, then.

01:19:18.441 --> 01:19:20.238
Kes!

01:19:20.801 --> 01:19:22.792
Come on, then, Kes.

01:19:23.641 --> 01:19:25.438
Come on.

01:19:31.041 --> 01:19:33.032
Come on, Kes.

01:19:36.921 --> 01:19:39.196
Casper?

01:19:39.281 --> 01:19:41.511
Bloody hellfire!

01:19:41.601 --> 01:19:44.991
- Hope l'm not too late.
- No. But you'll have to stand over there.

01:19:45.081 --> 01:19:47.549
- l'll go by the fence, eh?
- lt's all right.

01:19:48.561 --> 01:19:51.792
- As long as you keep quiet.
- l'll not say a word.

01:20:03.281 --> 01:20:05.272
Come on, Kes!

01:20:09.961 --> 01:20:11.952
Come on, Kes!

01:20:12.921 --> 01:20:14.718
Kes!

01:20:17.161 --> 01:20:18.958
Come on, Kes!

01:20:22.561 --> 01:20:24.472
Come on, Kes!

01:20:26.761 --> 01:20:28.558
Kes!

01:20:51.041 --> 01:20:55.717
Well done, Casper. The most exciting
thing l've ever seen in me life. Great!

01:20:56.561 --> 01:20:59.200
- Thrill of a lifetime, lad.
- Thank you, sir.

01:20:59.281 --> 01:21:01.954
Let's have a look at it.

01:21:02.041 --> 01:21:04.509
lsn't it beautifully marked, eh?

01:21:06.761 --> 01:21:10.276
Look at the feathers on it.
Oh, it's not gonna eat that, is it?

01:21:10.361 --> 01:21:13.080
Yes, sir. This bird's full of vitamins.

01:21:15.561 --> 01:21:17.358
Oh, dear!

01:21:18.841 --> 01:21:21.913
- Have any more birds before him?
- Stacks. Animals an' all.

01:21:22.001 --> 01:21:26.677
A young fox cub once.
Reared it and let it go. A little blinder!

01:21:26.761 --> 01:21:29.958
l've had magpies, jackdaws.
Had a young jay once.

01:21:32.081 --> 01:21:35.756
- He's your favourite, though.
- Others weren't int' same street.

01:21:35.841 --> 01:21:38.230
Come on, then. Come on.

01:21:44.281 --> 01:21:46.670
- Come on, sir.
- Oh, dear me!

01:21:49.481 --> 01:21:52.279
- Watch that mattress, sir. lt's slippy.
- OK.

01:22:00.401 --> 01:22:02.790
Look what's left, sir.

01:22:03.881 --> 01:22:06.873
Only t'sparrow's leg.
Must have been hungry.

01:22:06.961 --> 01:22:09.316
Must have been starvin'.

01:22:09.401 --> 01:22:12.199
You hang on here. l'll put him ont' perch.

01:22:14.961 --> 01:22:16.758
Come on, then.

01:22:29.281 --> 01:22:33.069
You know, there's something
weird about it when it's flyin'.

01:22:33.961 --> 01:22:37.920
- Hawks are t'best fliers there is.
- No, l didn't mean that.

01:22:38.001 --> 01:22:42.040
When it's flyin', there's something
about it makes you feel strange.

01:22:42.121 --> 01:22:45.591
- ls it cos everythin' goes quiet?
- That's it, aye.

01:22:45.681 --> 01:22:50.038
Other folks have noticed that. l know
a farmer who says it's same wi' owls.

01:22:50.121 --> 01:22:53.909
You know, when they get
his mice in his yard at night.

01:22:54.001 --> 01:22:57.550
When they swoop down, he feels like
pokin' his ears to make 'em pop.

01:22:57.641 --> 01:23:00.155
Cos it goes that quiet.

01:23:00.241 --> 01:23:03.358
lt's as if they're flying
in a pocket of silence.

01:23:03.441 --> 01:23:05.875
Have you noticed
how quietly we're speaking?

01:23:05.961 --> 01:23:10.512
As if we're frightened to raise our voices,
a bit like shouting in church.

01:23:10.601 --> 01:23:13.638
- lt's cos they're nervous.
- Oh, no. lt's more than that.

01:23:13.721 --> 01:23:17.077
lt's instinctive. lt's a sort of respect.

01:23:17.161 --> 01:23:21.632
l know, sir. That's what makes me mad.
When l take her for walks, somebody says

01:23:21.721 --> 01:23:24.758
''Look, it's Billy Casper and his pet hawk.''

01:23:24.841 --> 01:23:27.514
l could shout at 'em, sir. lt in't a pet.

01:23:27.601 --> 01:23:30.877
Or if somebody comes up to me
and says ''ls it tame?''

01:23:30.961 --> 01:23:34.715
ls it heck tame! Hawks can't be tamed.

01:23:34.801 --> 01:23:39.477
They're manned. lt's wild and it's fierce
and it's not bothered about anybody.

01:23:39.561 --> 01:23:43.349
Not bothered about me, right.
That's what makes it great.

01:23:43.441 --> 01:23:46.990
A lot of people wouldn't understand.
They like their pets to be fussed.

01:23:47.081 --> 01:23:51.074
l'm not bothered about that.
l just want her for her looks and to fly her.

01:23:51.161 --> 01:23:54.597
They can keep their talkin' budgies.
They're nowt compared wi' her.

01:23:55.441 --> 01:23:57.909
You're right, Billy. You're probably right.

01:23:58.681 --> 01:24:03.675
D'you know summat, sir? l think she's
done me a favour, lettin' me watch her.

01:24:11.761 --> 01:24:14.355
(TV) ''Same price, 7-1,
number 12, Doorkeeper.''

01:24:14.441 --> 01:24:17.239
What's he studyin' there?

01:24:22.161 --> 01:24:24.629
- Can l help you, son?
- No, thanks.

01:24:27.041 --> 01:24:29.555
Hey, mister, can you
tell me t'prices of these?

01:24:29.641 --> 01:24:31.632
What are they?

01:24:32.401 --> 01:24:34.198
Crackpot.

01:24:35.001 --> 01:24:36.992
Crackpot. 100-6.

01:24:38.201 --> 01:24:41.989
Tell Him He's Dead.
l've just been lookin' for this one meself.

01:24:42.841 --> 01:24:45.435
Tell Him He's Dead.
Second favourite, 4-1 .

01:24:45.521 --> 01:24:47.512
100-6, 4-1 .

01:24:48.241 --> 01:24:50.471
Would you back 'em?

01:24:50.561 --> 01:24:54.634
Tell Him He's Dead's a good horse.
Best horse int' race. Top weight.

01:24:54.721 --> 01:24:57.030
Don't fancy that one, though.

01:24:57.121 --> 01:25:01.034
No form. Hasn't even got a jockey on
here. No, shouldn't bother with that one.

01:25:01.121 --> 01:25:03.271
D'yer think they'll win, then?

01:25:03.361 --> 01:25:06.080
- How've you got them? Doubled?
- They're our Jud's.

01:25:06.161 --> 01:25:10.120
Oh, he'll be all right if they do,
but l can't see it meself.

01:25:10.201 --> 01:25:11.998
Right. Ta.

01:25:25.241 --> 01:25:29.234
- A bob's worth o' chips, and a fish.
- Serve him, will you, Mary?

01:25:30.201 --> 01:25:32.999
- Yes, love? What do you want?
- Fish 'n' chips.

01:25:33.081 --> 01:25:34.753
(kicks the counter)

01:25:34.841 --> 01:25:37.275
Stop kickin'. We only put that on today.

01:25:38.161 --> 01:25:41.949
- Got any scraps, missis?
- Yes, love. l'll put you some on.

01:25:42.921 --> 01:25:47.915
Two shilling, love. l'm gettin' rid of
these chips, Floyd. lt's gettin' late now.

01:25:48.681 --> 01:25:50.876
Aye. But don't be goin' mad.

01:25:50.961 --> 01:25:52.952
Sixpence change, love.

01:25:58.241 --> 01:26:02.757
(Floyd) These kids. l don't know,
Mr Glover, they're just all the same.

01:26:06.801 --> 01:26:09.520
- Can l have a quarter o' beef?
- By, those smell good.

01:26:09.601 --> 01:26:11.990
Can l have a quarter o' beef?

01:26:14.161 --> 01:26:16.436
- Tha still got that bird, then?
- Yep.

01:26:23.681 --> 01:26:26.149
- Here, you can have them for nowt.
- For nowt?

01:26:26.241 --> 01:26:28.391
- They're only scraps.
- Another chip?

01:26:28.481 --> 01:26:31.632
- No. l'm goin' for me dinner in a minute.
- Right, then. See yer.

01:26:31.721 --> 01:26:33.518
See yer.

01:27:00.881 --> 01:27:05.033
(teacher) Usual difficulty
over concentration. Hm?

01:27:07.121 --> 01:27:08.998
Three fives are 15, eh?

01:27:09.081 --> 01:27:12.835
We write 15 one, five.
You write five, one.

01:27:16.281 --> 01:27:19.353
(mouths) Oi, tha fuckin' twat!

01:27:20.401 --> 01:27:24.872
lsn't that that illustrious
brother of yours, Casper?

01:27:24.961 --> 01:27:30.115
Shouldn't have thought he was the type to
have paid a visit to his old school again.

01:27:31.241 --> 01:27:34.677
- What's the matter? Don't you feel well?
- No, sir.

01:27:34.761 --> 01:27:38.595
- Do you want to go for a drink of water?
- No, sir.

01:27:38.681 --> 01:27:41.832
- Well, open the window.
- l'm all right, sir.

01:27:42.921 --> 01:27:44.673
Please yourself.

01:27:44.761 --> 01:27:47.150
(bell)

01:27:47.241 --> 01:27:51.359
Right, now just pass your books forward,
will you? To the front.

01:27:51.441 --> 01:27:54.911
Front person on each row,
bring them to my desk, will you?

01:28:13.001 --> 01:28:15.390
What's the matter, Casper?
Lost something?

01:28:15.481 --> 01:28:17.949
- Me, sir? No, sir.
- On your way, then.

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:50.553
- (MacDowall) What's up with thee, Jud?
- lt's that little bastard, our Billy.

01:28:50.641 --> 01:28:55.635
l left him with a bet for t'horses and he's
kept t'stinkin' money. l'll kill the little git!

01:29:03.041 --> 01:29:05.555
- What are you playing at?
- Goin' to t'toilet, sir.

01:29:05.641 --> 01:29:07.313
Hurry up, then.

01:29:16.201 --> 01:29:17.919
(door slams)

01:29:28.241 --> 01:29:30.277
- (Clegg) l'm on 'ere!
- Seen our Billy?

01:29:30.361 --> 01:29:32.477
- Aye. He's here wi' me.
- Tryin' to be funny?

01:29:32.561 --> 01:29:36.110
Cos l'll stick thi head down there,
old pal, and flush it.

01:29:36.201 --> 01:29:39.034
- l asked if tha'd seen him.
- l wouldn't tell thee if l had.

01:29:39.121 --> 01:29:41.635
- Look, l'm warnin' yer!
- Ow!

01:29:55.681 --> 01:29:58.275
(classical music)

01:31:34.081 --> 01:31:36.720
'Ey up, Tibbut, has tha seen our Jud?

01:31:36.801 --> 01:31:39.599
- They've been lookin' all over for thee.
- Who has?

01:31:39.681 --> 01:31:41.558
- Gryce Pudding.
- What for?

01:31:41.641 --> 01:31:44.439
Youth Employment.
Tha should have gone for t'interview.

01:31:44.521 --> 01:31:48.070
- Has tha seen our Jud?
- Yeah. He wanted to know where tha was.

01:31:51.201 --> 01:31:53.669
- Where the devil have you been?
- Nowhere, sir.

01:31:53.761 --> 01:31:55.877
Nowhere?
Who are you, the lnvisible Man?

01:31:55.961 --> 01:31:58.156
l felt sick, sir, so l went to t'toilets.

01:31:58.241 --> 01:32:02.075
What happened? Did you drop down it?
l've had prefects looking for you!

01:32:02.161 --> 01:32:05.312
- l went out for a breath of fresh air.
- Where are you going now?

01:32:05.401 --> 01:32:09.155
- Employment officer.
- For your interview? Get off, then, lad!

01:32:09.241 --> 01:32:11.232
And God help your future employer!

01:33:00.521 --> 01:33:03.081
- Sit up, Peter.
- l'm sat up.

01:33:04.161 --> 01:33:06.800
And don't be like a dummy
when you get in there.

01:33:06.881 --> 01:33:10.760
Just tell him you're after a good job,
in an office or something like that.

01:33:10.841 --> 01:33:13.309
l'm not working in no office!

01:33:13.401 --> 01:33:17.917
- What are you after? A job on the bins?
- Can't you shut up?

01:33:18.001 --> 01:33:19.753
- Sit up.
- l'm sat up.

01:33:19.841 --> 01:33:22.913
- And straighten your tie.
- Tha's naggin'.

01:33:23.721 --> 01:33:26.110
Somebody's got to nag.

01:33:32.401 --> 01:33:34.392
ls it yer mam?

01:33:35.041 --> 01:33:37.760
- What job are tha after?
- Owt'll do me.

01:33:37.841 --> 01:33:39.797
- lt certainly won't.
- lt will.

01:33:39.881 --> 01:33:41.872
- lt won't.
- Right. Thank you.

01:33:41.961 --> 01:33:44.077
(man) Will you send the next one in?

01:33:44.161 --> 01:33:47.153
- Pardon?
- Will you send the next one in, please?

01:33:50.881 --> 01:33:53.600
- lsn't it your turn to go in?
- Suppose so.

01:33:54.201 --> 01:33:56.192
Well, go on, then.

01:34:12.281 --> 01:34:15.079
Get out! Knock and wait.

01:34:19.681 --> 01:34:21.751
Come in.

01:34:23.961 --> 01:34:26.429
Well, come in, lad, if you're coming.

01:34:29.001 --> 01:34:31.834
- Sit down, Walker.
- l'm not Walker, sir.

01:34:31.921 --> 01:34:35.118
Who are you, then? On my list
it should be Gerald Walker next.

01:34:35.201 --> 01:34:37.590
Oliver, Stenton, then Walker.

01:34:37.681 --> 01:34:39.911
- l'm Casper.
- Casper.

01:34:40.001 --> 01:34:43.994
Oh, sit down, Casper. l should
have seen you earlier, shouldn't l?

01:34:45.801 --> 01:34:49.271
Well, then, Casper,
what kind of job had you got in mind?

01:34:53.041 --> 01:34:54.713
Well?

01:34:54.801 --> 01:34:57.269
l don't know, sir.
l haven't thought about it.

01:34:57.361 --> 01:35:01.479
You should be thinking about it. You want
to start off on the right foot, don't you?

01:35:05.841 --> 01:35:08.309
Right, then.
Would you like to work in an office?

01:35:08.401 --> 01:35:12.394
- Or would you prefer manual work?
- What's manual work?

01:35:12.481 --> 01:35:16.474
lt means working with your hands. Things
like farming, engineering, plumbing.

01:35:16.561 --> 01:35:20.031
Things like that,
as opposed to penpushing jobs.

01:35:20.121 --> 01:35:23.909
l'd be all right in an office.
l have a job to read and write.

01:35:26.721 --> 01:35:28.518
''Manual''.

01:35:29.841 --> 01:35:35.154
Tell me, Casper, have you ever thought
about entering a trade as an apprentice?

01:35:35.241 --> 01:35:39.120
You know, as an electrician
or a bricklayer or something like that.

01:35:39.201 --> 01:35:43.991
Of course, the money's not too good
while you're serving your apprenticeship,

01:35:44.081 --> 01:35:47.915
but you'll always have a trade
at your fingertips, won't you?

01:35:48.001 --> 01:35:50.231
Well, what do you think about it?

01:35:50.321 --> 01:35:54.917
As you've said, you feel better working
with your hands. Perhaps this is the best.

01:35:55.001 --> 01:35:59.791
Of course, you'd have to go to technical
college and study for examinations.

01:35:59.881 --> 01:36:03.396
Some lads do it. Some do it for years,
two or three nights a week,

01:36:03.481 --> 01:36:06.359
right from leaving school
right up to mid-twenties,

01:36:06.441 --> 01:36:09.911
when they take their Higher National,
or even degrees.

01:36:10.961 --> 01:36:13.350
l say, lad. Are you listening to me?

01:36:13.441 --> 01:36:15.796
- Yeah.
- You don't look as though you are.

01:36:15.881 --> 01:36:19.351
l've other lads to see
before four o'clock, you know.

01:36:20.361 --> 01:36:22.477
lf nothing l've mentioned appeals to you,

01:36:22.561 --> 01:36:25.917
and if you can stand a hard day's work
and don't mind getting dirty,

01:36:26.001 --> 01:36:29.437
- there are good opportunities in mining.
- l'm not goin' down t'pit.

01:36:29.521 --> 01:36:33.833
Don't be put off by what you've heard.
Conditions have improved tremendously.

01:36:33.921 --> 01:36:36.435
l wouldn't be seen dead down t'pit.

01:36:36.521 --> 01:36:39.433
What about hobbies?
What hobbies have you got?

01:36:39.521 --> 01:36:44.311
Do you like gardening, or constructing
Meccano sets, or anything like that?

01:36:45.201 --> 01:36:48.159
- Don't you have any hobbies at all?
- Can l go now?

01:36:48.241 --> 01:36:52.234
What's wrong with you, lad?
Sit down. Sit down, l haven't finished yet.

01:36:53.761 --> 01:36:57.151
l've met some lads in my time,
but l've never met one like you.

01:36:57.241 --> 01:37:01.757
Half the time you're like a cat on hot
bricks, the other half you're not listening.

01:37:01.841 --> 01:37:03.672
Here. Take this form.

01:37:03.761 --> 01:37:06.992
lt gives you information about
leaving school and starting work.

01:37:07.081 --> 01:37:10.915
Things like pensions, superannuation,
national insurance, wages.

01:37:11.001 --> 01:37:15.040
At the back, there's a detachable form.
When you want your cards, fill it in...

01:37:15.121 --> 01:37:17.157
Come back, lad. l haven't finished yet.

01:37:17.241 --> 01:37:20.358
When you want your cards,
fill in that form, send it in. Got that?

01:37:20.441 --> 01:37:22.830
- Yeah.
- Don't forget. And listen, Casper.

01:37:22.921 --> 01:37:25.879
lf you do have trouble getting fixed up,
come in and see me.

01:37:25.961 --> 01:37:28.031
- Yeah.
- Send the next boy in.

01:37:47.201 --> 01:37:49.078
Kes!

01:37:52.521 --> 01:37:54.318
Kes!

01:37:56.081 --> 01:37:57.878
Kes!

01:38:03.241 --> 01:38:05.038
Kes!

01:38:07.321 --> 01:38:09.118
Kes!

01:38:19.161 --> 01:38:20.958
Jud?

01:38:22.641 --> 01:38:25.030
Jud?! Mother?!

01:38:28.681 --> 01:38:31.673
- Missis, have you seen our Jud?
- l haven't, love. Sorry.

01:38:37.761 --> 01:38:40.070
- Have you seen our Jud?
- Course l've seen him.

01:38:40.161 --> 01:38:43.392
- Doesn't look as though you've seen him.
- You've seen him, then?

01:38:43.481 --> 01:38:48.430
Course l've seen him. Come in here
playin' hell. Goin' to pull t'counter down.

01:38:48.521 --> 01:38:51.479
l had to fetch Eric Clough
to prove tha hadn't put t'bet on.

01:38:51.561 --> 01:38:54.473
- They won, then, did they?
- Both of 'em. 100-6 and 4-1 .

01:38:54.561 --> 01:38:58.110
- He'd have won a tenner, l tell thee that.
- Bloody hell.

01:38:58.201 --> 01:38:59.998
Kes!

01:39:03.361 --> 01:39:05.352
Come on, Kes!

01:39:06.041 --> 01:39:08.032
Come on, lass!

01:39:20.081 --> 01:39:21.878
Kes!

01:39:24.721 --> 01:39:26.518
Kes!
