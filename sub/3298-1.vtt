01:04.197 --> 01:06.227
<i>Aster!</i>

01:06.472 --> 01:09.171
<i>Aster, we have to go!</i>

01:09.382 --> 01:11.838
<i>They're gonna kill us!</i>

01:26.687 --> 01:29.070
I hope you're hungry.

01:29.390 --> 01:31.018
Excuse me?

01:31.118 --> 01:34.124
That's a lot of food, honey.

02:02.823 --> 02:04.125
Here you are, boys.

02:04.225 --> 02:07.825
- I'll be right back with your coffee.
- Thanks, sweetie.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.669
Two honks.

02:31.017 --> 02:32.854
Here you go.

02:40.006 --> 02:42.425
This isn't mine.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.341
She's got a gun!

02:57.578 --> 02:59.613
Put down the weapon and
get down on the ground!

02:59.713 --> 03:03.080
She ain't gonna shoot no one,
are you, sweetie?

03:04.751 --> 03:08.352
Hands up! Drop it!
Put it down, put it down!

03:09.974 --> 03:11.556
Flamingo!

03:13.160 --> 03:14.692
Come on!

03:22.336 --> 03:25.072
Put it down! Put it down, hands up!

03:25.372 --> 03:27.237
Get out, get out!

04:47.788 --> 04:50.421
Ma'am? Are you all right?

04:56.196 --> 04:58.080
I am now.

04:58.180 --> 05:01.065
What the heck are you
doin' way out here?

05:02.068 --> 05:03.870
Waiting for you.

05:58.119 --> 06:00.382
Thank you, Roy.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.800
She's got a gun!

06:32.592 --> 06:34.925
- <i>Drop the gun!
- We have to go!</i>

07:09.229 --> 07:10.764
<i>Get over here.</i>

07:10.864 --> 07:13.497
Are you ready to tell Cyrus tonight?

07:16.136 --> 07:18.366
No. Wait, wait, wait.

07:18.466 --> 07:21.275
Cyrus doesn't like it if I'm late.

07:21.375 --> 07:24.074
Don't want him to be mad at me.

07:24.277 --> 07:27.945
We're leaving,
doesn't matter what he thinks.

07:31.384 --> 07:33.783
Tell me more.

07:38.925 --> 07:40.524
<i>Come here.</i>

08:01.581 --> 08:04.718
<i>Once we're gone it's
gonna be perfect, Gwenny.</i>

08:04.818 --> 08:08.188
<i>Perfect. Just like we always wanted.</i>

08:08.680 --> 08:11.555
Oh, my God.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.365
- <i>Hey, you've reached Aster...
- And Gwen!</i>

08:51.465 --> 08:54.342
<i>Leave a message
and we'll get back to you.</i>

08:55.235 --> 09:00.771
Aster, it's me. I hurt somebody,
I think real bad.

09:01.074 --> 09:04.085
I don't know where I am, exactly.

09:05.746 --> 09:09.215
I found a key, the Starlight Inn.

09:09.315 --> 09:13.216
Room 88. I'm gonna go there, I guess.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.486
If you could just come
there as soon as you can.

09:23.663 --> 09:25.995
You get any fuel?

09:26.166 --> 09:30.270
- It means gas, did you get any gas?
- Do you know where the Starlight Inn is?

09:30.370 --> 09:34.000
Oh, yeah, sure. My ma has
a friend that works there.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.543
- Her name is Mary-Rose, or...
- <i>A waitress is in critical condition...</i>

09:36.643 --> 09:39.413
- No. Rose-Marie...
- <i>...in Ginette's Diner on Route 79.</i>

09:39.513 --> 09:41.314
<i>While no official
charges have been laid,</i>

09:41.414 --> 09:43.317
<i>this photo was taken at
the scene of the crime.</i>

09:43.417 --> 09:47.954
...she used to date this guy,
Ken, or whatever, I'm not sure.

09:48.054 --> 09:50.624
Maybe his name was Bobby or something?

09:50.724 --> 09:53.260
- Anyway...
- Do you know where it is?

09:53.360 --> 09:56.159
It's two miles down the road, Exit 103.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.256
I don't think you can do that in here.

12:06.092 --> 12:08.157
What's your name?

12:08.257 --> 12:09.526
Derrick.

12:15.268 --> 12:19.669
Well, Derrick, it's your lucky day.

12:20.273 --> 12:23.273
See, I'm gonna let you keep this car.

12:23.743 --> 12:26.276
Because I don't need it anymore.

12:37.123 --> 12:39.826
Starlight Inn. Room 88.

12:39.926 --> 12:42.192
<i>Just come there as soon as you can.</i>

13:51.131 --> 13:53.633
<i>Now get this right,
Winks, don't fuck it up.</i>

13:53.733 --> 13:56.703
It's not every day my girl
gets a 500 on the range.

13:56.803 --> 13:58.939
I actually don't think
it's that big a deal.

13:59.039 --> 14:02.575
Of course it is!
You're a natural with that thing.

14:02.675 --> 14:06.309
Hold it up, hold it up!
Pretend you're tough.

14:26.290 --> 14:27.994
<i>Here, let me do it.</i>

14:32.171 --> 14:34.938
<i>Come on, Gwen, we have to get up.</i>

14:38.444 --> 14:40.747
<i>Are you ready to tell Cyrus tonight?</i>

14:40.847 --> 14:43.613
<i>It's not that easy, Aster.</i>

14:46.786 --> 14:48.852
I'll do it tonight.

15:07.039 --> 15:10.106
<i>I wanted to tell you that</i>

15:10.476 --> 15:13.813
Aster and I are leaving town for a bit.

15:14.113 --> 15:17.550
Sort of permanent, actually.

15:17.650 --> 15:21.855
Just feel like I need a new start,
no more bartending.

15:22.155 --> 15:25.588
Of course, I'm gonna
finish all my shifts here.

15:26.392 --> 15:28.958
I hope you understand.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.829
Nothing's ever coming
between us, Gwenny.

15:42.533 --> 15:44.107
Gwenny's mine!

15:44.677 --> 15:46.743
<i>She always has been, always will be!</i>

15:49.349 --> 15:51.885
<i>With her and Aster skipping town,
there's a lot of loose ends.</i>

15:51.985 --> 15:54.654
- I'd say she's become expendable.
- Exactly.

15:54.754 --> 15:58.591
That prick Aster has affected her mind.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.466
We have to fix this!

16:01.566 --> 16:03.529
<i>Kill them both!</i>

16:03.629 --> 16:05.565
<i>Gwenny and Aster have to die!</i>

16:05.665 --> 16:07.764
Aster!

16:08.968 --> 16:11.437
Aster, we have to go!

16:11.537 --> 16:13.473
They're gonna kill us!

16:13.673 --> 16:15.359
<i>Gwenny's mine!</i>

16:15.459 --> 16:17.540
<i>Aster!</i>

17:18.886 --> 17:21.013
Winks? No.

17:21.114 --> 17:24.277
- Anything for you.
- Such a charmer.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.577
<i>Now get this right,
Winks, don't fuck it up.</i>

17:44.855 --> 17:46.517
Izzy?

17:47.199 --> 17:49.803
Cyrus killed Winks,
he's dead in the tub!

17:49.903 --> 17:53.937
- And Aster!
- Sorry, Gwenny. But you're outta control.

18:00.446 --> 18:04.350
What the fuck happened to you, Flamingo?
Everything's all fucked up!

18:05.451 --> 18:08.154
- What the fuck's wrong with you?
- Who are you?

18:08.254 --> 18:10.957
- Come on, we have to go.
- No, please.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.360
That guy almost fucking shot you!

18:13.460 --> 18:17.144
We have to go because shit is really
fucked up in a royal fucking way.

18:17.244 --> 18:19.562
- So come on, let's go.
- No, no.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.715
What, did you have a fucking
stroke or something?

18:22.815 --> 18:23.970
Get your shit together, let's go!

18:24.070 --> 18:27.571
- No, please!
- Let's go. We'll talk about it in the car.

18:29.275 --> 18:30.607
It's your lucky day.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.584
<i>In sports, the National Hockey League...</i>

18:46.545 --> 18:48.591
Name, miss?

18:49.328 --> 18:51.261
Flamingo.

18:52.848 --> 18:55.501
- Just Flamingo?
- Yup.

18:55.601 --> 18:59.172
And how will you be paying,
Miss Flamingo?

19:00.275 --> 19:01.975
Cash.

19:02.538 --> 19:05.477
Smoking or non?

19:06.979 --> 19:09.578
Just give me Room 88.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.650
88's non-smoking.

19:16.928 --> 19:19.655
Fucking A.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.562
- <i>Who are you?</i>
- <i>Let's go. We'll talk about it in the car!</i>

20:34.033 --> 20:36.035
Jesus Christ, Flamingo.

20:36.135 --> 20:38.571
Do you know how much heat we're gonna
have on our fucking asses now?

20:38.671 --> 20:40.873
We went over the plan a gazillion times.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.609
So I don't know how it went
from being a simple fucking hit

20:43.709 --> 20:47.009
to you shooting some fucking
waitress in the fucking face.

20:48.314 --> 20:52.849
It's real simple, Flamingo.
Two honks. And you screwed it up.

20:57.458 --> 20:59.799
Jesus Christ, you're a mess.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.659
What a fucking mess and
why are you fucking crying?

21:04.163 --> 21:06.462
Since when do you fucking cry?

21:09.531 --> 21:11.593
All right. Look, we'll go,
we'll grab some grub,

21:11.693 --> 21:14.336
we'll find a place and
we'll talk this through.

21:15.262 --> 21:16.939
Good?

21:18.411 --> 21:20.076
Good?

21:22.928 --> 21:24.050
Flamingo.

21:24.635 --> 21:26.015
<i>Let's go!</i>

21:29.816 --> 21:31.872
How's everything, hon?

21:55.991 --> 21:58.581
That's a shitload of pancakes,

22:00.119 --> 22:03.219
especially for a girl who
doesn't like pancakes.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.892
Can I help you?

22:12.198 --> 22:14.131
I know things got out of hand.

22:15.401 --> 22:17.637
I'm here to make amends.

22:18.037 --> 22:21.137
And you are?

22:23.515 --> 22:25.912
And who are you? Gwen?

22:26.312 --> 22:28.111
Or should I say Flamingo?

22:30.582 --> 22:32.151
I don't know what your angle is here,

22:32.251 --> 22:35.985
but your recent antics ain't
helping the situation.

22:37.087 --> 22:38.521
We have a situation!

22:40.826 --> 22:43.763
So, why don't you and your new hairdo

22:43.863 --> 22:47.296
finish your flapjacks so we
can go home and fix this?

22:47.800 --> 22:49.490
We have to fix this!

22:55.049 --> 22:58.211
Look, sorry about Aster, Gwen.

22:58.807 --> 23:01.002
Okay, whoever that is.

23:01.102 --> 23:02.549
That's right.

23:03.049 --> 23:05.748
That's all behind us now.

23:07.185 --> 23:10.622
Time to move on, together.

23:15.557 --> 23:17.071
Hey!

23:17.171 --> 23:19.161
Anyone in there?

23:24.069 --> 23:26.402
Are you done?

23:27.307 --> 23:30.310
You're coming with me
whether you like it or not.

23:30.410 --> 23:33.562
Either of your own volition
or with a gun in your back.

23:41.601 --> 23:42.625
Well,

23:44.156 --> 23:45.450
in that case,

23:46.603 --> 23:48.357
let's go.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.205
Your coffee's shit.

24:18.424 --> 24:20.681
Before you know it, Gwenny,

24:21.126 --> 24:22.859
everything's going to be back to normal.

24:25.569 --> 24:27.997
Nobody fucking move.

24:35.741 --> 24:38.240
You just crossed one big line, Gwenny.

24:38.844 --> 24:40.183
This don't make no sense.

24:40.283 --> 24:43.916
You calling me Gwenny is what
don't make no sense, old man.

24:44.516 --> 24:46.634
Next time you boys disturb me,
I'll cut off your dicks

24:46.734 --> 24:48.985
and stuff them down your dead throats.

24:51.857 --> 24:52.893
Let her go.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.165
Fuck.

24:59.665 --> 25:01.464
<i>Shit is seriously fucked up.</i>

25:01.868 --> 25:06.349
We'll find a place and we'll talk
this through. Good? Good?

25:07.973 --> 25:10.843
All right. It'll be fine.

25:10.943 --> 25:12.745
Yeah, yeah.

25:12.845 --> 25:14.888
Just hold that. Hold that.

25:21.053 --> 25:23.789
- So, Flamingo.
- Gwen.

25:23.889 --> 25:28.590
You're telling me that you have no
idea what happened to your hand?

25:31.430 --> 25:34.207
No. And me?

25:34.607 --> 25:36.402
- The plan?
- No.

25:36.502 --> 25:39.238
Bowling alley?
Sailing across the ocean? Nothing?

25:39.638 --> 25:41.574
Nothing.

25:41.964 --> 25:44.974
But you do remember that Cyrus
killed your boyfriend, Aster, right?

25:47.502 --> 25:51.680
Yeah. You are a real mind-bender, girly.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.382
Must be why I like you so much.

25:55.287 --> 25:57.857
Well, don't worry about
it because this time,

25:57.957 --> 26:01.223
we're going to figure out an
even better plan to kill Cyrus.

26:02.628 --> 26:04.230
This time?

26:04.330 --> 26:06.532
- Yeah.
- We tried to kill Cyrus?

26:06.632 --> 26:08.801
Yeah, Flamingo.
What do you think the plan is?

26:08.901 --> 26:11.892
That's what we were trying to do when
you accidentally shot that waitress.

26:12.772 --> 26:16.375
Okay. I don't know exactly what
our relationship was before,

26:16.475 --> 26:18.443
but I'm not a killer.
I don't kill people.

26:24.850 --> 26:27.049
You're joking, right?

26:28.253 --> 26:31.688
- I think you're on your own.
- No. No, no, no.

26:31.788 --> 26:34.927
We made a pact. I'm not backing
down from what we set out to do.

26:35.027 --> 26:39.298
Cyrus killed the love of your life in cold
blood and now he's coming to kill you, too.

26:39.498 --> 26:41.901
And if I just leave you, in your current
condition, you'll be dead by tomorrow.

26:42.001 --> 26:46.732
- What about the police?
- You're a wanted felon, Flamingo.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.805
So, I'm just supposed to trust you.

26:51.100 --> 26:52.485
Okay,

26:53.037 --> 26:56.516
Flamingo, I know this is probably the last
thing in the world that you want to hear,

26:56.616 --> 27:00.749
but I'm just going to say it, so please,
pay attention and look at me.

27:01.820 --> 27:05.287
I am all you've got.

27:09.061 --> 27:11.094
Why are you helping me?

27:13.532 --> 27:14.825
We're helping each other.

27:15.969 --> 27:19.189
You and me! You know, it's a real shame
you're rocking this whole memory-lapse thing

27:19.289 --> 27:23.475
because we had some pretty sweet team-building
experiences in the past little bit.

27:23.949 --> 27:25.574
So...

27:26.278 --> 27:27.944
Do we have a deal or what?

27:30.263 --> 27:31.952
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

27:32.052 --> 27:35.734
That's what I'm talking about, Flamingo.
Bringing the band back together.

27:35.834 --> 27:41.694
You and me, reunion tour,
fireworks, and unicorn stallions.

27:41.894 --> 27:43.700
I'm not killing anyone.

27:43.800 --> 27:45.937
Oh, that's okay.
I'm an excellent killer.

27:46.037 --> 27:48.534
I'll take care of that.
That's not a problem at all.

27:48.934 --> 27:51.070
Okay, okay, okay.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.463
First things first, we need
some guns and intel, which,

27:53.773 --> 27:56.042
as newly appointed leader,
I will take care of.

27:56.142 --> 27:59.086
Tomorrow, we are going to go
visit my good friend Lemmy.

27:59.586 --> 28:03.646
Girly, you'd better get some sleep because
tomorrow is going to be fucking awesome.

28:05.785 --> 28:09.288
You calling me Gwenny is what
don't make no sense, old man.

28:10.008 --> 28:11.520
Let her go.

28:18.230 --> 28:19.759
Name's Flamingo.

28:20.359 --> 28:21.931
Give me Room 88.

28:43.188 --> 28:45.244
<i>Flamingo. Flamingo.</i>

28:51.831 --> 28:55.965
Who are you, Mr. Cyrus Brenwin?

28:58.882 --> 29:02.204
- <i>She owes me everything!</i>
- What the fuck...

29:04.376 --> 29:06.342
...do you want with me?

29:21.930 --> 29:24.193
"88 Wilmont Lane."

29:27.466 --> 29:30.299
I guess we'll just have to find out.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.905
We need some guns and intel.

29:33.005 --> 29:35.737
As newly appointed leader,
I will totally take care of it.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.829
- Who did you say this was?
- Lemmy.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.962
You are going to love her.

30:03.268 --> 30:05.971
Conrad, Richard.

30:06.171 --> 30:07.870
How are you doing, fellas?

30:11.334 --> 30:12.841
Ready?

30:19.558 --> 30:23.355
- Heya, Lemmy!
- Hey, Ty. Get your sweet ass in here.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.691
Ain't she pretty?

30:27.081 --> 30:28.611
She likes you.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.698
I have got something I'm
just dying to show you.

30:32.942 --> 30:36.569
This here tortoise. It took me
34 tries to get him just right.

30:36.669 --> 30:39.142
But look at his smile.
I mean, look at his grin.

30:39.242 --> 30:42.405
Tortoises are just so cute.
They're stupid, but they live forever.

30:44.253 --> 30:47.609
Well, I'm just about leisured out.

30:50.616 --> 30:53.465
- Ty, what can I do for you, baby?
- Well...

30:56.031 --> 30:58.655
- Gotta restock.
- Conrad, Richard?

31:04.563 --> 31:08.273
- Totally untraceable, as per usual.
- Nice.

31:10.369 --> 31:12.394
Lemmy, while I'm here,

31:12.671 --> 31:15.782
have you, by chance, been keeping up
your business relationships with Cyrus?

31:15.882 --> 31:18.544
You're kidding me, right, Ty?
I mean, he's completely lost it.

31:18.944 --> 31:21.514
Little birdy told me that he severed
ties with Vinny the other day,

31:21.614 --> 31:25.050
killing one of his boys in the process
and sewing the other boy's lips shut.

31:25.350 --> 31:26.652
You know where we can find Cyrus now?

31:26.752 --> 31:29.989
I haven't the slightest clue, honey.
I mean, he's been hanging real low

31:30.089 --> 31:34.390
ever since some crazies opened up on him
at the bowling alley the other night.

31:35.094 --> 31:39.231
You wouldn't happen to know anything
about that now, would you, Ty?

31:39.431 --> 31:41.163
No, of course not.

31:43.101 --> 31:44.533
I didn't think so.

31:45.891 --> 31:49.741
Well, enough about that.
It's boring. Shall we?

31:51.142 --> 31:54.679
I have got this new toy
I'm just dying to show you.

31:54.877 --> 31:56.482
Check this out.

31:56.582 --> 32:00.783
Oh! It was blessed by a Tibetan
monk that I sell grenades to.

32:01.386 --> 32:02.865
Ain't she sexy?

32:02.965 --> 32:05.821
- Police! Don't move!
- Everybody down on the floor.

32:06.774 --> 32:09.361
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, me, oh my.

32:09.461 --> 32:12.032
- Drop your weapon.
- Well, that ain't fun.

32:14.794 --> 32:15.801
Fire!

32:15.901 --> 32:17.269
Fire!

32:18.737 --> 32:20.436
Drop your weapon.

32:21.778 --> 32:23.106
Shoot! Shoot! Shoot!

32:23.608 --> 32:25.244
- God damn it.
- Don't move!

32:27.912 --> 32:29.281
Get her!

32:29.481 --> 32:31.480
On my signal, we make a run for it.

32:34.253 --> 32:36.288
We've got an officer down.
Need backup now.

32:36.906 --> 32:39.482
Don't worry. This shield's
been blessed by the Pope, yeah?

32:39.582 --> 32:40.295
Yeah.

32:48.335 --> 32:49.698
Don't worry.

32:50.669 --> 32:52.168
It's just a flesh wound.

32:58.055 --> 32:59.420
I'll walk it off.

33:01.847 --> 33:03.779
Get out of here, sexies.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.652
<i>12-10, we have two suspects.</i>

33:11.189 --> 33:12.524
<i>Standing by.</i>

33:12.624 --> 33:15.243
All right. Look at me. Look at me.

33:15.343 --> 33:18.527
- We gotta go, Flamingo, okay?
- Lemmy just got shot in the throat.

33:19.698 --> 33:20.901
- On the count of three.
- No!

33:21.001 --> 33:23.472
One, two, three! Go!

33:23.572 --> 33:24.799
Go! Come on!

33:25.199 --> 33:26.899
Come on! Come on. Come on.

33:27.372 --> 33:29.171
<i>Sheriff, they're coming your way.</i>

33:30.057 --> 33:31.540
Ready your weapons.

33:33.312 --> 33:34.951
Hang on tight, girly.

33:35.251 --> 33:36.481
Don't move!

33:37.949 --> 33:40.439
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

33:40.539 --> 33:41.320
Fire!

33:55.163 --> 33:56.096
Come on!

33:58.069 --> 33:59.673
- Stop right there!
- Flamingo!

33:59.773 --> 34:02.508
Get down! Get down!

34:03.008 --> 34:04.473
I said stop.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.146
You are under arrest.

34:12.884 --> 34:16.446
<i>Who are you, Mr. Cyrus Brenwin?</i>

34:27.399 --> 34:29.632
"88 Wilmont Lane."

35:33.416 --> 35:34.763
This goes, I go.

35:56.788 --> 35:58.790
We're gonna sail across
the ocean one day.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.594
I don't even know how to sail.

36:02.694 --> 36:05.788
- We'll figure it out.
- <i>We probably need a boat first.</i>

36:09.601 --> 36:11.972
<i>Now get this right,
Winks, don't fuck it up.</i>

36:12.272 --> 36:13.266
You ready?

36:13.366 --> 36:16.471
Hold it up, hold it up!
Pretend you're tough.

36:19.110 --> 36:21.743
<i>Aster has affected her mind.</i>

36:23.082 --> 36:25.217
I'm going to marry you one day, Gwen.

36:26.134 --> 36:27.253
Kill them both!

36:27.753 --> 36:31.812
<i>Aster, we have to go!</i>
<i>They're gonna kill us!</i>

36:42.563 --> 36:44.332
<i>Gwenny's mine!</i>

36:44.769 --> 36:47.002
<i>She always has been, always will be!</i>

39:05.544 --> 39:09.533
- <i>Oh, this is my favorite song.</i>
- <i>Oh, I'm so sick of that song.</i>

39:10.233 --> 39:11.701
<i>This goes, I go.</i>

39:11.801 --> 39:15.101
<i>Oh, I'm sorry, is that a threat?</i>

39:16.187 --> 39:19.988
- <i>Give me that.</i>
- <i>You're just going to use it against me.</i>

39:20.325 --> 39:21.711
- <i>Here we are...
- No!</i>

39:21.811 --> 39:26.598
<i>...with Miss Gwen, successfully surviving
yet another birthday celebration.</i>

39:26.798 --> 39:29.034
<i>Tell us, Gwen, how do you feel?</i>

39:29.573 --> 39:31.262
<i>Old.</i>

39:31.536 --> 39:33.001
<i>Old?</i>

39:35.340 --> 39:38.840
<i>Can you put that down now, please?</i>

39:41.146 --> 39:44.446
- <i>Do you want to dance with me?</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

39:56.728 --> 39:58.661
<i>Happy birthday, Gwen.</i>

39:59.030 --> 40:00.198
<i>Thank you.</i>

40:00.598 --> 40:02.867
<i>We are rolling.
All right, Izzy, you got it?</i>

40:02.967 --> 40:05.564
- <i>Yep, I got it.</i>
- <i>All right. Thanks, man.</i>

40:05.837 --> 40:07.930
<i>All right. We're good.</i>

40:08.807 --> 40:09.908
- <i>Where are we going?
- Come on, birthday girl.</i>

40:10.008 --> 40:12.804
- <i>What horrible thing are you plotting?</i>
- <i>And sit.</i>

40:13.309 --> 40:15.143
<i>What did you get me?</i>

40:21.352 --> 40:22.663
- <i>I love this!</i>
- <i>Yeah?</i>

40:22.763 --> 40:26.357
<i>Yeah! Thank you. Thank you!
Thank you, everybody.</i>

40:26.457 --> 40:28.004
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

40:32.530 --> 40:36.768
That DVD was found at the diner
where you shot the waitress,

40:36.868 --> 40:40.102
whose name, by the way, was Mary,
and you better pray that she pulls through.

40:41.002 --> 40:46.092
Now, Gwen, you have a clean record,
at least you did up until yesterday,

40:46.192 --> 40:49.129
and it's clear that your boyfriend,
Aster, meant a great deal to you,

40:49.229 --> 40:52.460
so help me understand
how it is that you end up

40:52.560 --> 40:55.383
sitting across this table from me today.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.456
I don't know.

41:00.225 --> 41:03.501
Well, look, I ain't gonna blow smoke up
your ass. You're in a shitload of trouble.

41:04.101 --> 41:06.298
You shot that waitress
in broad daylight.

41:07.498 --> 41:08.830
<i>Witnesses everywhere.</i>

41:10.068 --> 41:13.301
I don't even know how
I got to the diner.

41:14.839 --> 41:17.405
I don't remember going there.

41:18.142 --> 41:21.276
I found a gun in a bag,

41:21.446 --> 41:24.800
and then it was in my hand, and then,

41:27.690 --> 41:32.824
I was scared.
There's a big horrible mistake.

41:33.024 --> 41:34.160
A mistake?

41:35.360 --> 41:37.429
Was the Starlight a mistake?

41:37.829 --> 41:40.362
The Starlight Inn?
'Cause that's where we found

41:41.232 --> 41:44.403
Samuel Winston,
better known as Winks, dead,

41:44.903 --> 41:46.968
along with this fellow
who works for Cyrus,

41:47.068 --> 41:49.160
who went by the name of Izzy, also dead.

41:52.211 --> 41:56.348
- But I don't know what happened.
- Sweetheart, that's how we found you.

41:56.548 --> 41:59.718
The manager at the Starlight Inn tipped
us off to a young woman and a man

41:59.818 --> 42:03.222
leaving the premises in a
cream-colored El Camino.

42:03.622 --> 42:06.257
That young lady was
registered to Room 88

42:06.357 --> 42:09.628
where we found the
bodies of Izzy and Winks.

42:10.328 --> 42:13.965
Oh, and your prints?
They're all over the crime scene.

42:14.265 --> 42:15.987
The only thing that doesn't fit

42:16.135 --> 42:21.247
is the young lady in question was
registered under the name of Flamingo.

42:21.906 --> 42:23.308
- But...
- No, no.

42:23.408 --> 42:26.244
Let me finish.
This gets real interesting.

42:26.544 --> 42:31.344
This morning, one of my men spotted that
cream-colored El Camino heading down Route 17.

42:33.410 --> 42:35.124
That's how we traced you to that house

42:35.224 --> 42:37.686
where your friends and you
killed five of my people.

42:39.858 --> 42:43.962
And your friend with the El Camino,
what was it he called you?

42:44.342 --> 42:45.664
Flamingo!

42:46.105 --> 42:50.202
That's right. So this brings me full circle,
right back to my original question,

42:50.302 --> 42:54.239
how does someone like you,
who I have never heard of before,

42:54.339 --> 42:58.176
just suddenly stand up and in cold blood
shoot a waitress in broad daylight,

42:58.276 --> 43:01.146
become the primary suspect
in two other murders,

43:01.246 --> 43:03.848
engage in a firefight with the
County Sheriff's Department,

43:03.948 --> 43:07.249
and eventually end up the most
wanted felon this side of Tennessee?

43:12.808 --> 43:15.723
All right. All right.

43:21.566 --> 43:25.269
When I saw you laying in
the dirt, beside that house,

43:25.728 --> 43:27.669
you were scared shitless.

43:29.508 --> 43:34.045
Now there's no way I'm going to
believe you're this stone cold killer.

43:34.145 --> 43:37.716
But you gotta help me understand
what the hell is going on here.

43:38.216 --> 43:41.149
'Cause some of this crap
just doesn't make sense.

43:47.992 --> 43:49.261
She owes me everything!

43:49.932 --> 43:51.377
Cyrus.

43:59.371 --> 44:03.242
Cyrus killed your boyfriend, Aster,
and you saw him do it, didn't you?

44:03.842 --> 44:06.036
- <i>Gwenny's mine.</i>
- <i>Aster, we have to go!</i>

44:06.136 --> 44:07.677
Kill them both!

44:09.048 --> 44:11.850
I'm guessing out of jealousy or spite.

44:12.350 --> 44:15.716
Now he's setting you up? Isn't he?

44:16.220 --> 44:20.158
- He wants to kill me.
- Yeah, I bet he does.

44:20.258 --> 44:24.395
Nothing would cap off this
shit-stained career of mine

44:24.495 --> 44:27.395
better than being able to put that
piece of trash away for good.

44:35.373 --> 44:39.478
You know, if you were to
help me put him away,

44:39.778 --> 44:41.947
I'm sure we could come to
some kind of an agreement.

44:42.047 --> 44:44.816
I mean, a young lady like yourself

44:44.916 --> 44:47.749
doesn't want to spend the rest
of her life in jail. Does she?

44:51.890 --> 44:54.056
But of course, if you don't help me,

44:55.493 --> 44:59.094
I'll personally see
that you rot in prison.

45:07.906 --> 45:10.274
What the hell's going on?

45:11.476 --> 45:12.879
What is that?

45:18.408 --> 45:19.120
Ty?

45:19.220 --> 45:21.164
- Did you miss me?
- Are you insane?

45:21.264 --> 45:24.519
You're gonna wanna put that on.
Let's get out of here.

45:30.460 --> 45:32.860
Anderson! Shoot 'em for me!

45:36.103 --> 45:37.335
No!

45:37.635 --> 45:41.103
- Stop shooting people!
- You're the boss.

45:42.707 --> 45:45.310
Oh, was that spectacular or what?

45:46.110 --> 45:47.643
Nice to see you, Flamingo.

45:53.784 --> 45:54.730
Ty?

45:54.830 --> 45:57.549
Freeze! I said freeze!

46:00.258 --> 46:01.376
Put it down!

46:09.534 --> 46:12.533
Girly... Girly... Girly...

46:13.438 --> 46:16.672
I got... I got the intel that we needed.

46:16.772 --> 46:17.876
That's where Cyrus is.

46:18.176 --> 46:21.376
- I'm not leaving you.
- There's no time.

46:22.146 --> 46:23.781
There's no time, you just gotta go.

46:23.881 --> 46:27.448
We made a pact. We do this together.

46:31.256 --> 46:34.822
- My job... My job's done, girly.
- It's okay.

46:35.967 --> 46:38.126
Seriously, Flamingo...

46:41.465 --> 46:44.331
I really liked you.

46:59.717 --> 47:02.150
- Where are they?
- Over here!

47:02.320 --> 47:04.175
Get her. Get her!

47:46.898 --> 47:49.267
<i>Nothing's ever coming between us.</i>

48:41.469 --> 48:42.915
Gwen!

48:44.188 --> 48:46.557
Who the fuck are you?
And stop calling me Gwen.

48:46.657 --> 48:50.058
It is you. I haven't seen you
in a while. I thought that...

48:52.430 --> 48:53.995
Anything for you.

48:55.699 --> 48:56.801
Where's Cyrus?

48:57.401 --> 48:59.300
You know his spot.

49:01.105 --> 49:03.204
Refresh my memory.

49:04.642 --> 49:06.879
Today, he's at Alley Cats, but...

49:07.679 --> 49:11.545
- No, I shouldn't have told you that.
- What's your name?

49:12.082 --> 49:14.252
Gwen, it's me, it's Winks.

49:14.352 --> 49:16.599
- Remember?
- You got a number, Winks?

49:16.699 --> 49:19.053
It hasn't changed since
the last time you called.

49:20.891 --> 49:22.357
Write it down.

49:27.265 --> 49:30.465
You know, if you ever need
to talk, about anything...

49:37.676 --> 49:40.411
Her name is Dakota, she dances here.
Have you seen her lately?

49:40.611 --> 49:41.742
- No.
- No?

49:41.842 --> 49:43.148
Could you at least pretend
to look at the picture?

49:43.248 --> 49:45.383
Didn't your mother ever tell you not
to pry in other people's business?

49:45.483 --> 49:48.583
Well, my mother was her mother,
and she was a bitch, so, no.

49:52.222 --> 49:54.055
We have a situation!

50:02.033 --> 50:03.267
Gwen!

50:03.815 --> 50:05.303
Give me some milk.

50:05.403 --> 50:08.172
Suck my tits! Get your own fucking milk!

50:08.952 --> 50:10.648
Get me some milk.

50:28.041 --> 50:29.761
Cheers, Cyrus!

50:32.696 --> 50:34.850
Next one's for you.

50:36.966 --> 50:38.366
That's karma.

51:11.669 --> 51:14.472
We don't get many attractive
ladies like you in here.

51:14.572 --> 51:16.424
Not with all their teeth anyway.

51:16.524 --> 51:19.243
I'll have five cheeseburgers

51:19.553 --> 51:21.442
and a milk.

51:26.417 --> 51:29.317
Cheeseburgers and milk coming right up.

51:46.437 --> 51:48.907
So... Cyrus,

51:49.007 --> 51:51.158
I heard things got a little
sloppy for you a while back?

51:51.258 --> 51:54.378
Yeah, word is you got a little too friendly
with some curly haired dancer broad

51:54.678 --> 51:55.914
and shit got real.

51:56.614 --> 51:58.783
Hey, you know what
else is funny about that?

51:58.883 --> 52:01.136
Vinny was dating some curly
haired bitch, wasn't he?

52:01.236 --> 52:03.751
- I heard about her.
- Name is Dakota?

52:04.354 --> 52:06.090
Ain't that a coincidence?

52:06.275 --> 52:08.569
Something you wanna say, boys?

52:08.669 --> 52:10.494
No, just making conversation.

52:12.396 --> 52:14.799
You give us a second, doll.

52:16.001 --> 52:20.171
Look... Cyrus, just give us the
cash and we'll be on our way.

52:20.271 --> 52:22.407
Sure, sure, sure.

52:22.607 --> 52:27.277
But first, why don't you
take a look at this for me.

52:32.316 --> 52:35.953
Does this look right to you?

52:36.071 --> 52:37.236
What?

52:40.991 --> 52:44.294
- Fuck, man!
- Now you see, Marv,

52:44.394 --> 52:47.562
this is my kind of conversation.

52:50.434 --> 52:54.605
Jesus! Holy shit! What the fuck, man?
What the fuck are you doing?

52:54.705 --> 52:57.007
- Boys?
- What the fuck, dude? Get off me!

52:57.107 --> 52:59.377
Get off me! Listen, Cyrus, listen to me!

52:59.477 --> 53:02.562
You can't fucking do this! You and Vinny,
you guys are fucking partners!

53:02.662 --> 53:05.883
I can do anything I want, Marvin.

53:05.983 --> 53:09.253
Besides, Vinny's product is

53:09.353 --> 53:12.690
fucking weak, like his women.

53:12.790 --> 53:15.052
Our shit's grade A and you know that!
Get off me, motherfucker!

53:15.152 --> 53:17.895
- Stop talking, Marvin.
- Oh, fuck you!

53:23.567 --> 53:25.945
Let me tell you what
happens now, Marvin.

53:26.045 --> 53:30.805
Izzy's gonna hold you down.
While Jessop sews your lips shut.

53:32.243 --> 53:33.744
Then,

53:34.444 --> 53:40.114
you're going back to Vinny

53:40.651 --> 53:42.509
and give him

53:42.609 --> 53:45.360
this letter,

53:45.460 --> 53:50.791
officially dissolving our

53:51.795 --> 53:53.928
business partnership.

54:09.713 --> 54:11.279
Hold still.

54:12.249 --> 54:13.782
I wanna get this started.

54:24.900 --> 54:26.394
There you go.

54:27.364 --> 54:29.730
Don't worry about Dakota.

54:31.602 --> 54:35.406
Oh, and... tell Vinny

54:35.506 --> 54:40.077
I appreciate the concern
you fellas have for my

54:40.177 --> 54:42.213
relationship woes.

54:43.801 --> 54:45.477
Have fun, boys.

54:48.660 --> 54:50.985
Okay, stay still. Stay still!

55:00.798 --> 55:03.230
Cheeseburgers and milk.

55:16.934 --> 55:18.679
Hey, Cyrus.

55:41.972 --> 55:42.947
Hey!

55:53.609 --> 55:54.818
Fuck!

55:55.953 --> 55:58.118
Hey, lady, I'll give you a ride.

56:01.725 --> 56:03.624
I don't like being followed.

56:08.473 --> 56:12.436
Wow, wow! That was fun.
Lady, you completely lost it in there.

56:12.536 --> 56:16.307
I mean, not that I didn't like it.
I did, I fucking loved it.

56:16.407 --> 56:19.050
That is the kind of fucking spunk
I'm looking for every single day.

56:19.150 --> 56:21.879
It was amazing and
downright sexy, and...

56:22.118 --> 56:23.544
Wow!

56:24.348 --> 56:26.222
You and I are really gonna get along.

56:35.993 --> 56:37.682
<i>Are you ready to tell Cyrus tonight?</i>

56:40.764 --> 56:42.997
<i>Cyrus doesn't like it if I'm late.</i>

56:51.575 --> 56:54.107
I'm going to marry you one day, Gwen.

57:23.641 --> 57:25.242
Jesus, Gwen, you gotta
get your head straight.

57:25.342 --> 57:28.446
You can't lose the keys every time
we go out for a couple of drinks.

57:28.946 --> 57:30.878
Sorry.

57:37.287 --> 57:40.454
Damn, I'm good. Get in!

58:15.159 --> 58:17.284
<i>An unknown accomplice
and suspected killer</i>

58:17.384 --> 58:21.143
<i>escaped from downtown jail this
afternoon and is currently at large.</i>

58:21.243 --> 58:24.661
<i>Sheriff Edward Knowles sustained
a bullet wound in the escape,</i>

58:24.761 --> 58:27.004
<i>but is expected to fully recover.</i>

58:27.104 --> 58:29.840
<i>Yes, I'm urging anyone who knows
the whereabouts of the killer</i>

58:29.940 --> 58:32.643
<i>to please come forth
as soon as possible.</i>

58:32.743 --> 58:37.144
<i>She's armed, dangerous,
and she must be stopped bef...</i>

59:23.258 --> 59:25.559
You realize you were speeding, ma'am?

59:28.165 --> 59:32.635
I haven't driven this road before.
I didn't notice the speed sign.

59:34.538 --> 59:37.037
License and registration, ma'am.

59:38.308 --> 59:42.312
Oh, shoot! You know what?
I was in a really big hurry,

59:42.412 --> 59:45.812
so I forgot my wallet,
everything, at home.

59:47.717 --> 59:49.513
Just stay where you are.

01:00:28.659 --> 01:00:31.526
Ma'am, I going to need you to
step back inside your vehicle.

01:00:33.563 --> 01:00:35.529
Get back in the vehicle!

01:01:30.821 --> 01:01:32.938
That's where Cyrus is.

01:02:15.715 --> 01:02:17.568
And he's awake.

01:02:17.768 --> 01:02:21.037
You have exactly seven seconds to tell
me who you are and what you want.

01:02:21.137 --> 01:02:22.740
Whoa, first things first.

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:25.806
Did you knock me out in my own vehicle
when I was staring at your titties?

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.112
- Yes.
- Well, I saved your life.

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:31.481
- You fucked my operation.
- Oh, I did?

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.428
And how's that blown off
pinky treating you?

01:02:33.528 --> 01:02:34.785
- Shut up!
- Okay.

01:02:34.885 --> 01:02:37.420
Unless the next words out of your mouth
are gonna be why I shouldn't kill you.

01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:40.991
Well, I saved your life, I hate Cyrus too,
and I will fuck you for free.

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:45.459
- I'm interested in the Cyrus part.
- Okay, well, it's a long story, girly.

01:02:48.198 --> 01:02:50.364
Abbreviated version.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.136
- Tick-tock.
- Right!

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:55.005
I have this sister, her name's Dakota.

01:02:55.105 --> 01:02:58.675
Total train wreck, druggie, nympho,
freak, shitty-ass piece of shit,

01:02:58.775 --> 01:03:00.411
but she's my sister, so I have
a soft spot for her, and...

01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:03.513
- Point of the story!
- Point of the story.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:05.482
Dakota was seeing this Vinny guy,

01:03:05.582 --> 01:03:07.518
who was beating the shit out of her.
Surprise, surprise.

01:03:07.618 --> 01:03:10.084
Anyway, one day she gets tired
of it and she runs to Cyrus,

01:03:11.522 --> 01:03:14.325
<i>who she knows because Cyrus
and Vinny do business together.</i>

01:03:14.425 --> 01:03:16.761
<i>She also knows that Cyrus and
Vinny aren't on the best of terms.</i>

01:03:16.861 --> 01:03:20.741
<i>So what she decides to do is go to
Cyrus, give him some sort of sob story,</i>

01:03:20.841 --> 01:03:23.000
<i>sit on his cock a couple times,
and next thing you know</i>

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:26.403
<i>she's got a job dancing at Flamingos
under Cyrus' protection...</i>

01:03:26.503 --> 01:03:30.204
This is Dakota, she's new to the family.

01:03:32.041 --> 01:03:33.974
Nice to meet you.

01:03:35.579 --> 01:03:39.282
Dakota goes AWOL a little bit ago
and I just know Cyrus did something.

01:03:39.382 --> 01:03:41.949
I can... I can fuckin' feel it.

01:03:45.655 --> 01:03:47.813
- This her?
- You went through my stuff?

01:03:47.913 --> 01:03:49.159
Yes or no?

01:03:49.924 --> 01:03:53.415
- Yes.
- Then, yes, she's dead. He's to blame.

01:03:53.515 --> 01:03:55.932
What? What?

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:59.069
What? How... How...

01:03:59.569 --> 01:04:00.938
How do you know that?

01:04:01.038 --> 01:04:03.532
- We have a situation!
- I wasn't here!

01:04:03.632 --> 01:04:05.139
<i>Gwenny!</i>

01:04:06.743 --> 01:04:08.775
I saw her body.

01:04:12.415 --> 01:04:15.247
Oh, fuck! Stupid bitch!

01:04:15.347 --> 01:04:20.057
She's such a stupid fucking
cunt of a fucking bitch of a sister.

01:04:20.157 --> 01:04:22.692
But she's your sister, Ty,
so you gotta calm down.

01:04:22.792 --> 01:04:25.129
You gotta be good about this
because she's a fucking bitch,

01:04:25.229 --> 01:04:28.495
but she's still your fucking
sister and she's... Fuck!

01:04:42.117 --> 01:04:43.981
I'm gonna kill Cyrus.

01:04:44.081 --> 01:04:46.783
I'll be the one putting a
bullet through his head.

01:04:46.983 --> 01:04:48.717
What did Cyrus do to you?

01:04:50.287 --> 01:04:54.324
He killed the love of my life all
because I saw your dead bitch sister.

01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:57.194
This ain't what it looks like!
We have to fix this.

01:04:57.294 --> 01:04:59.196
<i>He needed to fix the situation.</i>

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:04.968
- You can be my sidekick.
- Sidekick?

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:09.006
- Or you can be dead.
- Sidekick. Obviously, sidekick.

01:05:10.283 --> 01:05:11.705
Yeah.

01:05:13.677 --> 01:05:15.318
Now that I'm your sidekick,
I'm just gonna say

01:05:15.418 --> 01:05:17.481
I think you should really work
on your social skills, lady,

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:20.684
because you're not exactly
what I would call socially agile.

01:05:20.784 --> 01:05:25.722
I like to call it social dexterity because
without it you can't really do much.

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.688
My name is Ty.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.931
Flamingo. You fuck me, you die.

01:05:34.131 --> 01:05:36.997
You're talking figuratively,
not physically, right?

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:39.669
Anyway, I got some first aid training

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.972
and I really think that the
first thing we need to do

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:44.008
is we need to fix your
pinky because if we don't,

01:05:44.108 --> 01:05:47.474
you are definitely going to be getting
a visit from Captain Gangrene.

01:05:49.012 --> 01:05:51.878
Hurry up. I have a call to make.

01:05:53.216 --> 01:05:55.182
That's where Cyrus is.

01:06:38.422 --> 01:06:40.103
I've got a gun.

01:06:46.135 --> 01:06:48.368
I surrender.

01:06:50.492 --> 01:06:52.142
You just stay right there.

01:06:52.242 --> 01:06:56.076
Well, that's the plan.
I'm extremely comfortable.

01:06:57.614 --> 01:06:58.648
Drop the gun, Jessop.

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:03.854
Hold up. Everyone relax.
Let's have a little civility here.

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:07.524
- Jessop, give us a minute.
- Seriously?

01:07:07.624 --> 01:07:11.594
Yes, I'm serious!
I'm always fucking serious!

01:07:11.794 --> 01:07:13.927
Get the fuck out.

01:07:22.005 --> 01:07:25.141
I still remember when
I first took you in.

01:07:25.441 --> 01:07:27.873
Twelve years old.

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:31.714
In and out of how many foster homes?

01:07:32.283 --> 01:07:35.100
- Six.
- I saw something in you.

01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:38.017
You were sharp!

01:07:38.321 --> 01:07:40.824
You weren't afraid of hard work.

01:07:40.924 --> 01:07:45.658
And you were loyal.
You've always been loyal.

01:07:46.029 --> 01:07:48.898
And very special to me.

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.997
Yeah.

01:07:52.836 --> 01:07:57.237
You even waited till I was
16 to start screwing me.

01:07:57.741 --> 01:08:00.607
That makes a girl feel real special.

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:03.247
I've done a lot of
things I'm not proud of.

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:07.021
But you have to believe
I want to repent.

01:08:07.121 --> 01:08:08.051
Lies.

01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:12.589
All the shit that went down
with Dakota was fucked.

01:08:12.689 --> 01:08:14.720
She OD'd.

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.460
What can I say?

01:08:17.859 --> 01:08:20.093
But everything else...

01:08:20.397 --> 01:08:25.298
I was drunk. I was high,
I was strung out.

01:08:26.536 --> 01:08:29.703
What we got goes deeper
than that, Gwenny.

01:08:31.841 --> 01:08:34.506
I want to make amends.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:39.084
You killed...

01:08:39.906 --> 01:08:41.484
Aster.

01:08:41.818 --> 01:08:43.917
Gwenny, honey.

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:46.849
I never liked Aster.

01:08:47.349 --> 01:08:51.464
In fact, I loathed him trying
to take you away from me.

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:54.292
But I never killed him.

01:08:58.033 --> 01:08:59.558
After all this.

01:09:00.468 --> 01:09:02.559
After all this shit,

01:09:02.658 --> 01:09:04.777
you're just going to sit there

01:09:04.877 --> 01:09:08.868
and keep lying straight
into my fucking face?

01:09:09.813 --> 01:09:12.606
If you have one ounce of compassion

01:09:12.706 --> 01:09:15.606
left in your in your fucking soul...

01:09:24.517 --> 01:09:26.792
- Jessop!
- Yeah?

01:09:37.841 --> 01:09:41.111
Twenty years,
Jessop's been my right-hand man.

01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:44.281
But when push comes to shove,
I can still do that.

01:09:44.481 --> 01:09:48.015
'Cause me and him don't
have what you and I got.

01:09:49.296 --> 01:09:51.850
Loyalty, Gwenny.

01:09:52.819 --> 01:09:55.855
That's our bond.

01:10:00.270 --> 01:10:03.697
Be honest. What kinda dope you on?

01:10:05.068 --> 01:10:06.570
You know I don't touch that shit.

01:10:06.670 --> 01:10:10.390
Nobody acts the way you've been
acting without being on something.

01:10:10.490 --> 01:10:11.341
Stop!

01:10:11.441 --> 01:10:15.166
Why did you run off after Aster?
I was looking right at you.

01:10:15.266 --> 01:10:19.149
You're fucking lying!
I know you're lying!

01:10:19.249 --> 01:10:21.384
You... You drugged me.

01:10:21.684 --> 01:10:26.019
To set me up! So you could pin
all your fucking shit on me!

01:10:26.756 --> 01:10:31.257
I know how you work, Cyrus. I have seen
you do it, like, a hundred times before!

01:10:31.983 --> 01:10:34.060
You fuck.

01:10:35.365 --> 01:10:38.465
You actually don't
remember what happened?

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:47.440
No.

01:10:48.344 --> 01:10:49.710
What do you remember?

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:57.350
Jessop! We have a situation!
The fucking bitch is dead.

01:10:58.154 --> 01:11:02.556
- Gwen! What are you doing here?
- I came in early.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:06.496
I wasn't here!

01:11:06.596 --> 01:11:09.896
Gwenny! This ain't what it looks like!

01:11:13.470 --> 01:11:17.573
<i>I remember you just lost it.</i>

01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:20.740
<i>I wanted to run.</i>

01:11:21.511 --> 01:11:25.459
<i>I guess I thought I needed to help you.</i>

01:11:26.315 --> 01:11:29.215
<i>Just one more time.</i>

01:11:32.789 --> 01:11:36.055
<i>Then I heard something.</i>

01:11:36.993 --> 01:11:39.929
- We gotta deal with this girl, boss.
- Shut the fuck up, Charlie!

01:11:40.029 --> 01:11:41.964
Gwenny's good, Cyrus. We can trust her.

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:44.901
- She's seen tons of shit worse than this.
- Yeah, Gwenny's tight.

01:11:45.201 --> 01:11:46.770
I wouldn't be too sure, boss.

01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:49.205
With her and Aster skipping town,
there's a lot of loose ends.

01:11:49.305 --> 01:11:51.808
- I'd say she's become expendable.
- Exactly.

01:11:52.108 --> 01:11:53.476
She and that asshole boyfriend of hers

01:11:53.576 --> 01:11:56.045
will use this against me
and I'll lose her forever.

01:11:56.245 --> 01:11:58.736
Gwenny's mine!
She always has been, always will be.

01:11:58.836 --> 01:12:01.718
We have to fix this! Kill them both!

01:12:02.110 --> 01:12:03.761
Gwenny and Aster have to die!

01:12:09.225 --> 01:12:11.227
Don't just stand there!

01:12:11.521 --> 01:12:13.026
Gwen! Get her!

01:12:14.931 --> 01:12:16.596
You're not ready to let me leave.

01:12:18.467 --> 01:12:21.534
Aster was going to take me away.

01:12:25.714 --> 01:12:27.367
You killed him.

01:12:29.312 --> 01:12:32.649
<i>Come out with your hands up.</i>
<i>We've got you surrounded.</i>

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:40.053
<i>Cyrus, we know you're in there.</i>

01:12:43.218 --> 01:12:44.724
Fuck me.

01:12:46.896 --> 01:12:48.728
You got a number, Winks?

01:12:50.633 --> 01:12:52.599
Hurry up. I have a call to make.

01:12:57.440 --> 01:13:00.206
Why do you need to know where Cyrus is?

01:13:01.378 --> 01:13:03.943
Are you gonna make things
go back to normal?

01:13:05.147 --> 01:13:07.113
Something like that.

01:13:10.086 --> 01:13:12.652
You're gonna hurt him, aren't you?

01:13:14.958 --> 01:13:17.923
Oh, Gwen, your hand looks so bad.

01:13:18.179 --> 01:13:20.059
Where is he?

01:13:22.665 --> 01:13:24.503
Look, I can't just go
telling you all this stuff.

01:13:24.603 --> 01:13:28.734
- If Cyrus found out, he'd kill me.
- Not if I kill him first.

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:32.472
Cyrus is like family to you.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:35.541
Who do you think fucked up my hand?

01:13:41.185 --> 01:13:42.882
Winks!

01:13:48.675 --> 01:13:51.369
Ginette's Diner, off Route 79.

01:13:51.469 --> 01:13:53.689
Tomorrow, 9:00 a.m.

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:56.257
He's picking up a
shipment from the chef.

01:13:56.357 --> 01:14:00.131
This is Cyrus' number one supplier,
so he always does a face to face.

01:14:00.231 --> 01:14:02.038
It's a respect thing.

01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:05.071
Everything goes down in the shed,
out back the kitchen.

01:14:06.242 --> 01:14:08.645
You wouldn't be lying to me, now?

01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:12.645
Of course not. You're my best friend.

01:14:15.939 --> 01:14:17.150
Good.

01:14:18.054 --> 01:14:20.524
Please don't kill him, Gwen.
It's not going to change anything.

01:14:20.624 --> 01:14:23.490
You're going to make everything
worse than it already is.

01:14:27.196 --> 01:14:29.262
He killed Aster.

01:14:30.566 --> 01:14:32.324
No, no, that's not right.

01:14:32.424 --> 01:14:33.736
- Yes, it is.
- No, it ain't.

01:14:33.836 --> 01:14:35.769
- Yes, it is.
- Enough is enough!

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.410
- You're not right.
- Fuck you.

01:14:40.510 --> 01:14:42.879
You need a doctor. I'll take you.

01:14:48.284 --> 01:14:50.053
What's going on?

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:52.827
Oh, fuck, Flamingo!

01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:56.827
He seemed like a good kid, you know,
and you said you were just going to talk.

01:14:57.627 --> 01:15:00.063
- He was calling the cops.
- Jesus Christ.

01:15:00.163 --> 01:15:02.365
- Well, what about the intel?
- Ginette's, 9:00 a.m.

01:15:02.465 --> 01:15:05.768
Okay. Well, he's clearly dead, Flamingo.

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:08.565
The last thing I want to be doing tonight
is digging this poor kid a shallow grave.

01:15:08.665 --> 01:15:11.193
- So put him in the tub.
- Good idea.

01:15:16.396 --> 01:15:18.882
It's the end of the road, Gwenny.

01:15:18.982 --> 01:15:23.653
One of us has to answer for all that's
gone down since you went sideways.

01:15:23.753 --> 01:15:26.956
But I ain't going to jail
for shit I never done.

01:15:27.056 --> 01:15:28.891
Oh, you done plenty, Cyrus.

01:15:28.991 --> 01:15:32.626
Think about it. What really
happened at your place?

01:15:40.303 --> 01:15:45.439
Aster! Aster, we have to go!
They're gonna kill us!

01:15:48.601 --> 01:15:49.889
Aster!

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:55.815
Unfortunately, my survival
instincts outweigh my loyalty.

01:15:56.686 --> 01:16:00.457
And the world only believes
the last man standing.

01:16:00.657 --> 01:16:05.913
Don't worry, though,
you'll look great in the papers.

01:16:06.013 --> 01:16:07.260
<i>Aster!</i>

01:16:24.847 --> 01:16:27.380
Just tell me you did it.

01:16:28.117 --> 01:16:31.821
Tell me you killed Aster. Just say it.

01:16:32.221 --> 01:16:34.854
Probably didn't even pull the trigger.

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:38.261
Just tell me who did.

01:16:38.961 --> 01:16:41.360
I just need to know.

01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:46.199
You did, honey.

01:17:56.472 --> 01:17:58.141
Would you have said yes?

01:17:58.741 --> 01:18:00.593
Yes.

01:18:00.893 --> 01:18:04.357
Yes. I say yes, I say yes, I say yes.

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:07.168
<i>I say yes!</i>

01:18:48.590 --> 01:18:50.890
Gwen! Gwenny.

01:19:30.741 --> 01:19:32.798
It was you.

01:19:33.269 --> 01:19:35.474
But you can tell them...

01:19:35.982 --> 01:19:38.014
it was me.

01:21:16.406 --> 01:21:20.877
I don't know. I was always thinking
that I'd go to Mexico or something,

01:21:20.977 --> 01:21:25.048
you know, and start, like,
selling scooters, or something like that.

01:21:25.148 --> 01:21:28.329
Or, oh, I could totally become
a professional poker player,

01:21:28.429 --> 01:21:30.821
- those guys make crazy money.
- Do you play poker?

01:21:30.921 --> 01:21:32.655
That's not the point, Flamingo!

01:21:32.755 --> 01:21:35.091
The point is, it's all about luck,
and I have a horseshoe up my ass.

01:21:35.191 --> 01:21:37.292
I'm going to sail across the ocean.

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:39.542
- That's random.
- Are you ready?

01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:41.682
Oh. Of course I'm ready, Flamingo.

01:21:41.782 --> 01:21:44.300
The intel we got from your boy, Winks,
I mean, that's airtight,

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:46.405
and I'm sure as shit not going
to let that poor kid die in vain.

01:21:46.505 --> 01:21:48.805
- The plan?
- Okay, the plan.

01:21:48.905 --> 01:21:52.075
You hole up in the diner, I station
myself in the El Camino around back,

01:21:52.175 --> 01:21:55.378
when Cyrus shows up, I'm gonna
honk twice, that's your cue.

01:21:55.478 --> 01:21:58.071
You wait 10 seconds, you get up,
you walk through the kitchen,

01:21:58.171 --> 01:22:00.355
you execute the son of a bitch.
You keep on walking,

01:22:00.455 --> 01:22:02.707
you hop in the El Camino with me,
we drive off into the sunset.

01:22:02.807 --> 01:22:05.755
- And Bob's your uncle.
- Don't fuck up.

01:22:05.855 --> 01:22:07.965
- You got a way with words, girly.
- Ty?

01:22:08.065 --> 01:22:10.676
- Yeah?
- Nothing.

01:22:13.029 --> 01:22:15.264
Sail across the ocean?
Don't sound too shabby.

01:22:15.364 --> 01:22:17.800
Maybe... I'll join my lady friend.

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:20.135
- Who might that be?
- You.

01:22:20.372 --> 01:22:22.402
Two honks.

01:22:24.539 --> 01:22:25.905
Two honks!

01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:44.356
Bless your soul.
Beautiful day, ain't it?

01:22:49.665 --> 01:22:51.697
Sure is, old man.

01:22:56.189 --> 01:22:57.406
Coffee, sweetie?

01:22:57.506 --> 01:23:01.641
Milk, early bird number two, pancakes.

01:23:07.016 --> 01:23:09.285
Hiya, fellas. Y'all gonna
be having the usual, today?

01:23:09.585 --> 01:23:12.986
- You betcha, Mary.
- So, three usuals coming right up.

01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:30.940
<i>All right, and we're back. Next up,
we have one of my favorite oldies.</i>

01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:35.078
<i>Always takes me back to the very
first time I heard it. Enjoy.</i>
