02:10.666 --> 02:12.166
Is that plum jam?

06:39.125 --> 06:40.125
Oh my God...

06:40.208 --> 06:42.458
I'm so hungry. I have to eat.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.291
Yes, please.

09:13.375 --> 09:14.666
Keep calm, come to no harm.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.000
Keep calm, come to no harm.

09:19.208 --> 09:20.750
Keep calm, come to no harm.

10:54.375 --> 10:56.583
Hospital? Hospital? Hospital?

13:16.833 --> 13:18.041
Where are your clothes?

13:32.750 --> 13:34.041
We have to go back...

13:34.625 --> 13:37.375
-I'll drive.
-You need to go to a hospital.

13:37.458 --> 13:38.416
No, no!

13:39.208 --> 13:40.458
No hospitals.

13:42.416 --> 13:43.416
The girl...

13:44.916 --> 13:46.375
I have to find her.

13:55.166 --> 13:56.750
But I'll drive, okay?

26:32.166 --> 26:34.833
Okay... What the hell happened last night?

26:40.458 --> 26:42.875
You asked me to help you find a girl.

26:44.083 --> 26:48.000
And from the money you offered,
I knew it wasn't legit.

26:48.083 --> 26:51.291
But you didn't say anything about needles.

26:51.375 --> 26:53.666
You said nothing about...

26:53.750 --> 26:56.750
kids with weapons or you getting naked

26:56.833 --> 27:00.625
or fucking vibrating eyes!

27:00.708 --> 27:01.541
I lost control.

27:02.250 --> 27:03.458
-You lost control?
-Yes.

27:03.541 --> 27:05.583
I thought it was my
last chance to find her.

27:05.666 --> 27:06.958
You know what? I...

27:07.833 --> 27:11.458
When I found you,
it looked like you had murdered her.

27:12.291 --> 27:13.250
Or worse.

27:13.583 --> 27:15.750
Ripped up clothes, blood...

27:17.916 --> 27:21.833
Jesus, man. You're like a bloodhound,
back on her trail.

27:21.916 --> 27:23.625
What the fuck... What are you up to?

27:24.958 --> 27:25.875
Listen.

27:27.708 --> 27:29.583
This girl is special.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.166
Special how?

27:35.291 --> 27:36.916
Special in what way?

27:39.250 --> 27:40.375
I have to...

27:41.041 --> 27:42.625
take her back with me.

27:57.750 --> 27:58.625
Damn...

28:00.916 --> 28:02.166
Okay, well...

28:03.625 --> 28:04.875
Where to now?

28:07.583 --> 28:10.250
I guess she's scared, so...
she'll go home.

29:16.333 --> 29:17.416
Check upstairs.

30:05.041 --> 30:05.958
She's not here.

30:31.083 --> 30:34.625
How can one little girl
cause so much trouble?

30:35.875 --> 30:36.833
Let's go.

32:04.166 --> 32:05.666
I told you she wouldn't be here.

32:06.750 --> 32:07.666
Okay...

32:08.458 --> 32:09.708
smart ass...

32:09.791 --> 32:10.791
Where is she?

32:11.250 --> 32:13.750
How the hell should I know?
You're the one...

32:26.041 --> 32:27.166
What about this guy?

32:52.250 --> 32:53.958
Kids nowadays. All piss and...

47:22.083 --> 47:23.083
My love.

47:23.166 --> 47:24.166
Please...

49:47.125 --> 49:49.250
It must be back... Back there.

49:51.875 --> 49:53.041
Turn around.

50:04.958 --> 50:06.458
I'll do the talking.

50:06.791 --> 50:09.000
No need for you
to go all "Chuck Norris" again.

50:09.291 --> 50:10.208
Okay?

50:12.875 --> 50:13.916
Keys!

50:14.666 --> 50:16.875
Come on!

51:08.541 --> 51:09.541
We lost them.

51:11.500 --> 51:12.333
We lost them.

51:15.083 --> 51:17.208
Stop, stop. Stop. Stop!

51:18.875 --> 51:20.208
Stop the van!

51:23.291 --> 51:26.166
What the hell?
Jesus Christ, what's wrong with you man?

51:36.625 --> 51:38.041
It's nothing, I'm fine.

51:38.125 --> 51:39.708
This is not fine!

53:04.291 --> 53:06.291
