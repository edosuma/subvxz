of this movie at www.skeebdo.com

00:18.100 --> 00:20.000
Excuse me. Can you give me a hand?

00:20.000 --> 00:22.100
I'm looking for Scofield Road.

00:22.100 --> 00:24.600
The map says it's near the rock quarry.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.500
Okay.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.500
Thanks for the help.

00:43.467 --> 00:44.500
Hello?

00:47.400 --> 00:49.900
Hello? Anybody back there?

01:04.400 --> 01:06.100
Oh, no...

01:12.933 --> 01:14.100
No...

01:14.500 --> 01:16.400
I told her--

01:16.400 --> 01:19.000
I told Leanne we couldn't live without each other.

01:24.300 --> 01:26.000
But she wouldn't come back to me.

01:28.300 --> 01:30.200
No... No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Wait...

01:35.600 --> 01:37.100
MIKE'S DINER MURDERS

01:37.100 --> 01:38.500
YOUR SEARCH - "MIKE'S DINER MURDERS" - DID NOT MATCH ANY DOCUMENTS.

01:45.600 --> 01:47.800
Nice to see you again, Mrs. Dubois.

01:48.800 --> 01:50.567
I hope I didn't frighten you.

01:50.800 --> 01:53.700
Agent Cooper? What are you doing here?

01:53.900 --> 01:56.500
I told you I never want to see you again.

01:56.500 --> 01:59.300
Actually, I'm here to make a peace offering.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.000
Did you ever hear of a murderer nicknamed "The Gentleman Caller"?

02:04.000 --> 02:06.700
Abducted five young women back in the 1980s?

02:06.700 --> 02:08.600
Never was caught.

02:08.600 --> 02:14.600
For a while now, the police have assumed that he's either dead or in prison on some unrelated crime.

02:15.200 --> 02:16.500
They're wrong.

02:18.100 --> 02:21.167
The Gentleman Caller is very much alive.

02:23.000 --> 02:24.733
Would you like his name and address?

02:27.400 --> 02:28.800
What are you doing?

02:28.800 --> 02:30.300
I told you,

02:30.700 --> 02:33.066
I'm attempting to make amends.

02:34.600 --> 02:36.800
His name is Kyle Hawkins.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.300
Kyle Hawkins, huh?

02:41.200 --> 02:43.934
When he would finish with his victims,

02:44.100 --> 02:47.100
he liked to bury them on the edge of Phoenix.

02:47.100 --> 02:48.600
The only problem is,

02:48.600 --> 02:50.400
a housing development is going up at that location.

02:50.400 --> 02:52.600
They're breaking ground in a week.

02:52.600 --> 02:57.400
So, tonight he's going to dig up the remains of his girls

02:57.400 --> 02:59.500
and move them to a safer place.

02:59.500 --> 03:01.700
If you instruct the police

03:01.700 --> 03:06.100
to go to the very end of of Gayley Hill Drive at approximately 8:30,

03:06.100 --> 03:08.000
you'll catch him in the act.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.500
No ambiguity, Mrs. Dubois, no room for deception.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.600
Kyle Hawkins...

04:14.500 --> 04:15.667
Kyle Hawkins?

04:16.000 --> 04:17.500
That's what Agent Cooper said his name was.

04:17.500 --> 04:19.600
Agent Cooper. Tips from the dead.

04:20.300 --> 04:23.200
Well, he was one of the FBI's best profilers.

04:23.200 --> 04:24.800
Emphasis on the "was."

04:24.800 --> 04:27.000
Look, I don't know how seriously to take this either.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.800
The man certainly had no problem lying to me in the past.

04:30.400 --> 04:32.767
On the other hand, if what he's saying is the truth...

04:33.400 --> 04:37.200
Okay, I suppose we can spare a couple of squad cars tonight.

04:37.200 --> 04:40.200
In the meantime, I'll see what I can find out about this Hawkins fellow.

04:40.300 --> 04:42.900
See if there actually is a Hawkins fellow.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.700
Is there something else?

04:45.700 --> 04:47.400
Actually, there is.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.600
Just before I discovered Agent Cooper in my kitchen,

04:50.600 --> 04:52.433
I had a dream about...

04:52.600 --> 04:55.100
I guess you could call it a massacre.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.401
It happened at a place called Mike's Diner.

04:57.466 --> 05:00.600
Armed gunman went in, shot everybody inside.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.500
I'm not sure where Mike's Diner is,

05:02.500 --> 05:05.999
other than it may be near a place called Scofield Road,

05:06.200 --> 05:08.567
which is supposed to be near a rock quarry.

05:08.800 --> 05:12.600
I have no idea when it happened, or if it's happened yet,

05:13.000 --> 05:15.200
but it seemed to have occurred during the daytime.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.300
Mike's Diner, Scofield Road, rock quarry.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.667
Oh, and the shooter was upset with his girlfriend--

05:20.734 --> 05:23.168
his ex-girlfriend-- Leanne.

05:23.300 --> 05:24.699
She works there.

05:25.200 --> 05:30.300
One serial killer, one diner massacre-- got it.

05:30.367 --> 05:32.100
Anything else?

05:33.500 --> 05:36.000
Thanks for coming all the way to the airport to see me.

05:36.000 --> 05:37.900
Of course, you're the boss.

05:38.200 --> 05:39.800
Happy to do it.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.600
What brings you to Phoenix?

05:42.600 --> 05:45.000
Oh, refuel on the way to Japan.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.900
Oh. Cheers.

05:48.300 --> 05:51.500
I realized I had a whole 45 minutes here.

05:51.500 --> 05:54.100
Thought maybe I'd use it to talk to you about staffing.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.667
Staffing?

05:56.400 --> 05:58.200
I want to hit you with a name.

05:59.500 --> 06:01.000
Hal Munzell.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.300
After 20 years an arrest has finally been made
(PHOENIX POLICE ARREST "THE GENTLEMAN CALLER")

06:05.300 --> 06:08.000
in the notorious "Gentleman Caller" murders.

06:08.000 --> 06:10.500
Police, acting on an anonymous tip,

06:10.500 --> 06:13.000
discovered Kyle Hawkins digging a hole...

06:13.400 --> 06:14.800
Can you believe that?

06:14.800 --> 06:15.767
What's that?

06:15.767 --> 06:17.100
Kyle Hawkins.

06:17.100 --> 06:19.700
He was exactly where Agent Cooper said he would be.

06:19.700 --> 06:23.366
Doing exactly what Cooper said he'd be doing.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.000
Maybe he really is sorry.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.800
Maybe he meant what he said.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.232
Maybe.

06:29.100 --> 06:33.300
Oh, come on. I just helped solve a 20-year-old murder case.

06:34.700 --> 06:38.200
I'm sorry. I just can't understand why Terry is so impressed with this guy.

06:38.400 --> 06:41.100
This is the most unspectacular resume I've ever seen.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.500
Didn't you already call him, ask him to come in?

06:44.700 --> 06:46.366
Well, I left him a message.

06:47.300 --> 06:49.500
What choice did I have?

06:50.300 --> 06:52.600
Who knows, with any luck, maybe he won't get back to me.

06:53.900 --> 06:55.500
Oh, I guess I spoke too soon.

06:55.700 --> 06:56.900
Nope, I don't think so.

06:56.900 --> 06:57.934
I think it's mine.

07:03.600 --> 07:04.500
Hello.

07:04.500 --> 07:06.900
I'm guessing you're the reason our esteemed district attorney

07:06.900 --> 07:09.800
sent me out here to the middle of nowhere to visit Mike's Diner.

07:09.800 --> 07:11.400
You're kidding. You're out there?

07:11.400 --> 07:12.934
I just left.

07:12.934 --> 07:15.534
Had some excellent chicken pot pie, too, by the way.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.200
So everything's okay?

07:17.200 --> 07:19.433
Well, it depends how you define okay.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.066
That waitress you told Manny about,

07:21.133 --> 07:22.667
Leanne, she's fine.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.300
So are all the people at the diner.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.400
That's terrific news.

07:26.700 --> 07:29.200
Yeah, well, hold that thought.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.500
You don't happen to be anywhere near a computer, do you?

07:32.500 --> 07:35.500
'Cause I'm about to send you an e-mail.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.000
There.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.800
This guy look familiar?

07:39.800 --> 07:41.699
Hold on, I'm just getting the e-mail open.

07:47.000 --> 07:49.133
Oh, my God.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.933
This the guy you saw massacre everyone at that diner?

07:52.200 --> 07:53.666
Oh, Lee...

07:53.733 --> 07:54.800
Is everything all right?

07:54.800 --> 07:56.400
I'm going to take that for a yes.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.200
The guy's name was Adam Dietz.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.200
Leanne gave us his address.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.900
I guess the two of them are an item.

08:01.900 --> 08:03.200
No, were an item.

08:03.200 --> 08:05.900
Apparently she left him after he lost his job.

08:06.100 --> 08:08.333
Poor guy was about to lose his house, too.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.500
Even left a handy suicide note,

08:10.500 --> 08:14.200
lest there'd be any confusion about what he did or why he did it.

08:14.300 --> 08:16.100
So he never even went over there?

08:16.100 --> 08:17.800
He never threatened anyone at all?

08:18.400 --> 08:19.200
Nope.

08:19.200 --> 08:20.966
Hey, that's the good news.

08:21.500 --> 08:24.000
Looks like the only life this guy took was his own.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
I guess we'll compare notes in the morning, huh?

08:26.000 --> 08:27.234
I guess.

08:29.100 --> 08:33.700
TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN,
THIS LIFE HOLDS NOTHING MORE FOR ME. NO LOVE, NO LIGHT, NO HOPE, ONLY PAIN.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.100
No, wait, I don't want to do this.

08:45.100 --> 08:45.900
Don't make me do this.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.467
Fine. Shall I shoot you in the groin now?

08:49.300 --> 08:51.667
Adam, we talked about this.

08:51.900 --> 08:54.200
Either you hang yourself or I shoot you six times.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.500
First shot in the groin.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.600
We wait ten minutes.

08:56.600 --> 08:57.700
Second shot in the eye.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.034
We wait another ten.

08:59.034 --> 09:00.100
Third shot in the Adam's apple...

09:00.100 --> 09:01.866
All right, all right, I'm sorry!

09:01.933 --> 09:03.400
Never mind!

09:08.500 --> 09:09.900
Now jump.

09:10.900 --> 09:12.300
Please, no, I don't think I can.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.900
Don't make me do this. I can't do this.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.100
You can do it, Adam, it's easy.

09:16.100 --> 09:18.734
Please, no! Don't make me do this!

09:27.300 --> 09:28.768
- Hi, Sheila.
- Good morning, Joe.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.300
Hi. Can I help you?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.200
Hal Munzell.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.100
I received your message on my voice mail.

09:37.100 --> 09:38.267
Oh, right, yeah.

09:38.267 --> 09:39.500
I asked you to call me.

09:39.500 --> 09:41.701
I know. I thought this might be better.

09:43.000 --> 09:44.800
Oh, well, to be honest, I...

09:44.900 --> 09:47.201
...prefer to sort of set aside some time and, you know...

09:47.400 --> 09:49.500
Is this a bad moment?

09:49.500 --> 09:51.134
Have you got an appointment?

09:51.199 --> 09:53.767
Am I disrupting something?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.600
No, it's all right. You're fine.

09:55.600 --> 09:58.500
Have a seat, Mr. Mun-Munzal?

09:59.034 --> 10:00.267
Munzell.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.900
Munzell.

10:02.467 --> 10:03.967
Okay.

10:04.700 --> 10:06.267
All right, yeah, I was looking--

10:06.267 --> 10:08.367
I was looking at your resume last night.

10:08.434 --> 10:10.168
Here we go.

10:11.333 --> 10:12.333
Okay.

10:13.333 --> 10:15.800
Well, I see that you moved around quite a little bit.

10:15.801 --> 10:17.500
You don't seem to stay in one place for very long

10:17.501 --> 10:19.367
and I just was curious why that might be.

10:20.600 --> 10:21.700
I suppose that over time,

10:21.700 --> 10:24.101
I find that I don't much like my colleagues,

10:24.900 --> 10:27.633
or perhaps they find that they don't much like me.

10:31.866 --> 10:36.100
Um, my boss, Terry Cavanaugh, he took a real shine to you.

10:37.200 --> 10:39.233
Wh-where did you... where did you two meet?

10:39.299 --> 10:40.800
We were at a conference.

10:40.866 --> 10:42.866
He made a pass at the woman I was with.

10:47.499 --> 10:48.966
Okay.

10:49.033 --> 10:51.500
Well, um, I...

10:51.500 --> 10:52.800
I'm just starting to meet people,

10:52.800 --> 10:57.900
and I see you're at... at Taylor-Hammond in Houston, which is good,

10:57.900 --> 11:02.200
because it may be a while before I figure out exactly which way I'm gonna go with this position.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.200
You know, listen, when I was on the plane with Terry...

11:06.600 --> 11:07.800
You were on the plane with Terry?

11:07.800 --> 11:12.200
He mentioned that you were struggling with the dye sensitizer mechanisms in your solar cell.

11:12.600 --> 11:15.000
And I put some thought into it, and I came up with some ideas.

11:15.200 --> 11:16.800
Thought maybe you would like to take a look.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.000
I don't know what to tell you, Allison.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.400
It just didn't look like a murder to me.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.300
Well, it may not look like it, but I'm telling you,

11:22.300 --> 11:24.467
that man was forced to put that rope around his neck.

11:24.467 --> 11:25.567
And what about the note the guy left?

11:25.567 --> 11:27.400
You telling me he was forced to write that, too?

11:27.600 --> 11:29.900
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I am.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.333
Allison, look at the physical evidence.

11:33.400 --> 11:34.800
There were no signs of forced entry,

11:34.800 --> 11:37.100
no signs of struggle, no defensive wounds.

11:37.100 --> 11:39.167
And it's not like the guy didn't have a reason to do what he did.

11:39.167 --> 11:39.967
Lee...

11:39.967 --> 11:42.101
Allison, what is it you'd like me to do?

11:42.168 --> 11:44.800
The only physical description you've given me is, the guy was wearing a hoodie.

11:44.800 --> 11:48.200
Do I haul in every male in the Phoenix metro area who owns a hoodie?

11:48.300 --> 11:50.100
And need I remind you that just 24 hours ago,

11:50.100 --> 11:54.700
you told me you saw the victim-- the exact same guyI saw swinging from a rafter last night--

11:54.700 --> 11:56.700
massacre a diner full of people?

11:56.800 --> 11:58.300
I'm sorry, no offense,

11:58.300 --> 11:59.800
but you're not on your A game here, lady.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.999
I think maybe you just need to take a step back.

12:02.400 --> 12:05.400
You'd be hard-pressed to find a more unlikable human being.

12:05.400 --> 12:06.667
Well, don't hire him.

12:06.667 --> 12:08.000
Well, I wouldn't, except for two things.

12:08.000 --> 12:09.667
My boss is championing the guy,

12:09.734 --> 12:12.100
and these drawings are amazing.

12:12.100 --> 12:13.400
What do you mean?

12:13.400 --> 12:14.700
Well, look, when I met the guy,

12:14.700 --> 12:16.900
I couldn't figure out why Terry would have anything to do with him,

12:16.900 --> 12:19.100
but now...but now I look at the work, I totally get it.

12:19.400 --> 12:22.300
I mean, this guy really is a spectacular thinker.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.400
His solution for our dye sensitizer problems really are amazing.

12:26.900 --> 12:28.834
I mean, I don't think I have a choice.

12:30.800 --> 12:31.866
Okay, that's it.

12:31.866 --> 12:33.300
It's done.

12:33.900 --> 12:35.000
What's done?

12:35.000 --> 12:38.100
I just wrote Terry and told him I'm hiring his friend.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.300
And then, I e-mailed Hal.

12:41.300 --> 12:44.000
Told him I'd be interested in having him start as soon as possible.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.400
Wow, you really are a man of action.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.566
No, I just know the inevitable when I see it.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.100
Besides, you don't have to...

12:53.100 --> 12:55.400
like everyone you work with, right?

12:55.400 --> 12:57.600
I'm trying to build a company,

12:57.800 --> 12:59.600
not start a club.

12:59.900 --> 13:03.200
Spoken like a true captain of industry.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.600
Which is great, 'cause it might just be time for me to retire.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.499
What are you talking about?

13:09.566 --> 13:10.600
Well, I don't know.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.000
It seems more and more lately,

13:12.000 --> 13:14.300
the things that I see, the things that I dream,

13:14.300 --> 13:16.500
there's not a lot to them.

13:17.300 --> 13:19.766
If that's the case, what's the point?

13:35.267 --> 13:39.900
Is this sleeplessness a product of your excitement over the capture of the Gentleman Caller?

13:41.300 --> 13:42.733
Congratulations.

13:42.900 --> 13:44.400
No, thank you.

13:45.000 --> 13:47.600
We both know it wouldn't have happened without your help.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.700
I'm just pleased that we've finally begun to repair our relationship.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.900
You gave me some good information, and I'm grateful,

13:55.900 --> 13:56.900
but I wouldn't call this...

13:56.900 --> 13:59.867
this association a relationship.

14:03.300 --> 14:05.200
Michael Bradley.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.300
Who's Michael Bradley?

14:12.300 --> 14:16.400
A serial rapist with a predilection for women with blonde hair.

14:16.600 --> 14:19.100
He's struck four times over the last 18 months.

14:19.100 --> 14:22.533
Two of his victims were high school students.

14:22.900 --> 14:25.666
The last girl that he attacked fought back.

14:25.900 --> 14:29.234
And the police were able to recover a hair sample.

14:29.400 --> 14:34.000
If they could locate this man and procure some of his DNA,

14:34.400 --> 14:38.234
I think that they would find a perfect match.

14:38.600 --> 14:41.600
Convicting him would be a relatively simple matter.

14:42.200 --> 14:44.366
Tell me, Mrs. Dubois.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.334
Would you like his home address?

14:50.200 --> 14:53.800
DEAR DOUG, I COULDN'T BEAR WITH THE PAIN ANY LONGER. ALL MY LOVE, RACHEL STETSON

15:11.300 --> 15:12.499
I can't.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.566
You have to.

15:15.900 --> 15:18.100
But I don't understand.

15:18.433 --> 15:20.533
You're just a boy.

15:27.300 --> 15:29.333
Allison...

15:29.400 --> 15:31.200
this police report is crystal clear.

15:31.200 --> 15:34.800
Three weeks ago, Rachel Stetson took her own life, period. End of story.

15:34.800 --> 15:38.800
I'm telling you, she was forced to inject herself, just like that man was forced to hang himself.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.400
By some boy?

15:41.000 --> 15:42.900
This woman was being treated for chronic depression--

15:42.900 --> 15:45.700
she even said as much in the note that she left for her husband.

15:45.700 --> 15:48.166
I think the boy told her what to write.

15:48.400 --> 15:49.400
Okay.

15:49.500 --> 15:52.000
I'll play along. So, there's this teenager.

15:52.800 --> 15:54.800
He can get in and out of houses and apartments

15:54.800 --> 15:58.266
without leaving any sign of forced entry.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.600
And without firing a single shot,

16:00.600 --> 16:05.200
he can convince people two, three times his own age to take their own lives without putting up a struggle.

16:05.200 --> 16:06.567
Forget how-- why?

16:08.300 --> 16:09.500
I don't know.

16:12.500 --> 16:14.300
I'm not trying to embarrass you.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.100
What would you like me to do?

16:16.100 --> 16:20.700
I can't really assign a detective, because no actual crimes have been reported.

16:20.800 --> 16:23.600
I could put you with a composite artist, but...

16:24.000 --> 16:26.400
once we have a sketch, what would we do with it?

16:26.500 --> 16:28.800
I mean, if you had a name, I could have someone interview the kid,

16:28.800 --> 16:32.200
at least determine where he was on the nights in question, but without a name,

16:32.200 --> 16:33.899
I'm really at a loss.

16:34.100 --> 16:38.700
You know, the detective assigned to the youth crimes task force...

16:38.700 --> 16:42.800
he keeps an up-to-date collection of all the high school yearbooks in the metro area.

16:43.100 --> 16:44.800
If you want to, maybe you could flip through those,

16:44.800 --> 16:47.500
see if you could find his picture, get a name.

16:48.300 --> 16:49.600
Thank you. I'd like that.

16:51.100 --> 16:52.600
Oh, here, sorry.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.100
I almost forgot.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.400
"Michael Bradley, 1714 Andover Lane."

17:01.700 --> 17:02.800
Forgive me, what is this?

17:03.100 --> 17:05.700
That's the address for the serial rapist you've been looking for,

17:05.700 --> 17:08.133
the one who likes blonde high school girls.

17:09.099 --> 17:10.800
Really, is this something you dreamed?

17:10.800 --> 17:12.099
No.

17:12.099 --> 17:14.500
But I think it's reliable information.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.467
I had nothing to do with it.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.000
Dad?

17:20.000 --> 17:22.000
Hey. Everything okay?

17:22.400 --> 17:23.666
I don't know.

17:23.900 --> 17:25.400
Where did you get these?

17:25.467 --> 17:27.500
Um... these?

17:28.300 --> 17:31.000
Oh, a fellow who came in looking for a job gave them to me-- why?

17:31.700 --> 17:33.933
I know this is gonna sound strange,

17:34.300 --> 17:36.834
but I think I had a dream about them last night.

17:36.834 --> 17:38.400
About these?

17:38.400 --> 17:40.400
About schematics?

17:40.400 --> 17:41.900
I pretty much put it out of my head

17:41.900 --> 17:44.500
until I saw them sitting on your laptop just now.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.100
Okay, what about them?

17:46.100 --> 17:48.500
I can't imagine they'd make much of a dream.

17:48.500 --> 17:50.000
Well, they didn't really.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.500
There was this guy,

17:52.500 --> 17:56.466
and he was standing in the middle of nothing with some papers in his hand.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.700
And he kept screaming, "These are mine.

17:58.733 --> 18:01.600
"Tell your father these are mine. They belong to Clay."

18:11.366 --> 18:13.600
The police haven't arrested Michael Bradley yet.

18:15.900 --> 18:17.567
You scared me.

18:18.100 --> 18:19.700
They're staking out his apartment.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.167
They'll pick him up soon.

18:21.167 --> 18:22.768
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

18:22.900 --> 18:26.566
I overheard Bradley's brother tip him off about the stakeout.

18:26.900 --> 18:29.300
Now he's hiding at a friend's apartment.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.967
It's on the corner of Western and Del Mar.

18:32.034 --> 18:33.366
Wait a second.

18:33.433 --> 18:35.600
Western and Del Mar?

18:35.800 --> 18:37.800
Thank you. I'll pass that along.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.400
So...

18:39.400 --> 18:42.500
what's with this sudden fascination with high school boys?

18:43.400 --> 18:46.500
I'm looking for this killer that I've been dreaming about.

18:47.200 --> 18:49.334
I think he goes to this high school.

18:49.900 --> 18:51.000
I can't question him.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.700
I can't go in the school and ask about him.

18:52.700 --> 18:54.500
I have no evidence.

18:54.800 --> 18:56.900
Just wanted to see him in the flesh,

18:56.900 --> 18:58.166
make sure I was right.

18:58.233 --> 19:00.066
What do you mean, no evidence?

19:00.300 --> 19:02.266
There's always evidence.

19:02.333 --> 19:05.700
If there is murder, slaughter of some kind, there's evidence.

19:05.700 --> 19:06.766
No, you're wrong.

19:06.833 --> 19:09.400
He's very clever. He makes it look like suicide.

19:09.600 --> 19:10.800
Really?

19:10.800 --> 19:14.000
You indicated that he was a serial offender.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.466
Serial offenders are, by their nature, peacocks.

19:17.700 --> 19:20.500
They almost never disguise their crimes.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.500
They want their activities written about.

19:22.500 --> 19:26.100
They want their personas speculated about.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.300
I'm sorry, Mrs. Dubois.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.800
I'm skeptical.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.200
You're not alone.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.500
Pretty raw.

19:44.700 --> 19:46.100
Kind of interesting.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.600
So, what is it you want to show me?

19:53.567 --> 19:55.701
What's so damned important?

19:59.866 --> 20:01.167
What's this?

20:01.534 --> 20:02.634
What am I looking at?

20:03.401 --> 20:06.900
Uh, it's an obituary for a, uh...a guy named Clay Barrett.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.200
37-- he was young.

20:09.200 --> 20:10.800
What's this got to do with me?

20:10.800 --> 20:13.000
Um, he died four months ago of a brain aneurysm.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.234
Before that, he worked at Taylor-Hammond.

20:15.400 --> 20:17.200
Um, he was something of a wunderkind.

20:17.200 --> 20:21.700
He taught grad seminars on the dye sensitization of solar cells

20:21.700 --> 20:24.434
when he was an undergraduate, when he was, like, a sophomore.

20:24.700 --> 20:29.300
Um, now, Hal Munzell shared an office with him for two years.

20:29.700 --> 20:32.600
I know you're very excited about Hal's designs,

20:32.600 --> 20:34.534
but I'm worried that they might not be his.

20:38.100 --> 20:41.167
That's a serious accusation, Joe.

20:42.200 --> 20:43.400
Who's making it?

20:43.467 --> 20:44.900
Somebody at Taylor-Hammond?

20:45.300 --> 20:48.334
Actually, my source did work at Taylor-Hammond.

20:49.300 --> 20:50.100
Did?

20:50.100 --> 20:51.733
He longer works there.

20:54.100 --> 20:55.833
I didn't actually talk to him myself.

20:55.900 --> 20:59.200
Uh, he reached out through somebody that, um...

20:59.600 --> 21:03.234
that I'm very close to, somebody that I really trust.

21:04.100 --> 21:05.334
Fine.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.200
Can you give me a name?

21:07.267 --> 21:08.766
I'd rather not.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.900
Is there any proof, anything to back this story up?

21:13.900 --> 21:17.933
No, uh, but like I said, this is somebody that I trust.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.500
A lot.

21:19.500 --> 21:25.000
Well... I'm sorry, maybe you trust this person, but...

21:25.000 --> 21:28.000
I don't think I could let a man go on the say-so of

21:28.010 --> 21:31.600
some unnamed, disgruntled former colleague.

21:31.600 --> 21:32.600
It's not like that.

21:32.700 --> 21:34.300
It's exactly like that.

21:35.300 --> 21:39.500
According to you, this person couldn't even screw up enough courage to make the accusation in person.

21:39.500 --> 21:43.000
Had to go through some third party.

21:44.200 --> 21:48.601
Frankly, Joe, I'm surprised you'd waste my time with this.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.500
Terry, you know about my wife, right?

21:57.800 --> 22:00.700
You telling me you got this idea from your wife?

22:01.200 --> 22:03.632
No, actually, it came from my daughter.

22:07.000 --> 22:09.900
I'm tired. I've been on a plane all day.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.000
I'm still not home.

22:12.800 --> 22:15.300
So I shouldn't care that he might be a thief?

22:17.400 --> 22:19.500
Hey, I'd care if you could prove it.

22:19.700 --> 22:21.100
But you can't.

22:21.700 --> 22:24.101
You don't want Hal on your team, fine.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.100
All you have to do is to beat his idea.

22:27.100 --> 22:29.833
Save me more time, save me more money.

22:30.300 --> 22:32.200
If you can't do that...

22:40.400 --> 22:43.900
You forgot to clean the outside of the cylinder.

22:44.300 --> 22:46.433
Remember how I showed you?

22:47.500 --> 22:50.300
Congratulations, by the way.

22:50.300 --> 22:54.133
You followed my instructions to the T.

22:54.700 --> 22:58.200
Apparently, there's not a shred of physical evidence

22:58.200 --> 23:01.601
to tie you to the deaths of these people.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.434
That's impressive.

23:04.701 --> 23:08.267
That's very impressive.

23:08.400 --> 23:14.200
And the way you slipped in and out of that house and that woman's apartment.

23:14.300 --> 23:16.567
You have a real talent for this line of work.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.534
I keep thinking about them, though.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.434
Both of them.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.600
The way they pleaded for their lives, you know, the looks on their faces.

23:29.300 --> 23:31.000
The guy was so scared.

23:31.067 --> 23:36.000
That woman... she was so sad.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.067
That will pass,

23:38.300 --> 23:41.833
but the accomplishment will live on,

23:42.900 --> 23:46.500
and that's what you need to revel in, young man, the accomplishment.

23:47.800 --> 23:50.200
If you hadn't done what you did,

23:50.500 --> 23:52.300
that man would have gotten up the next morning,

23:52.300 --> 23:55.534
gone to that diner and snuffed out all those lives.

23:56.200 --> 23:59.200
Saving seven or eight innocent souls

23:59.400 --> 24:03.300
in the return for the death of one sociopath--

24:04.200 --> 24:07.000
I'd say that's a pretty good trade.

24:13.600 --> 24:15.366
If you're calling the police,

24:15.366 --> 24:17.033
I wouldn't bother.

24:17.500 --> 24:21.367
By the time they were able to search young Brandon's home,

24:21.666 --> 24:23.567
the weapon would be long gone.

24:25.767 --> 24:27.433
How long did it take,

24:28.266 --> 24:30.366
once you realized he was sensitive,

24:30.366 --> 24:32.566
that he could see you, hear you?

24:32.566 --> 24:34.934
How long did it take?

24:36.666 --> 24:39.100
What's the difference?

24:39.566 --> 24:43.866
I needed someone to help me, and you were unwilling.

24:44.366 --> 24:46.166
He's a child!

24:46.966 --> 24:49.100
You've got him killing for you!

24:51.567 --> 24:52.867
You're a monster.

24:52.934 --> 24:54.066
I'm a monster?

24:54.266 --> 24:55.567
What about Adam Dietz?

24:56.366 --> 24:59.866
You dreamt about what he was prepared to do to everyone in that diner.

25:00.566 --> 25:04.266
And Rachel Stetson, that woman that you saw injecting herself.

25:04.366 --> 25:06.901
Did you know that she was a nurse?

25:07.166 --> 25:11.566
Perhaps you also heard that she was struggling with depression.

25:12.366 --> 25:14.233
But what you couldn't have been aware of

25:14.366 --> 25:17.466
was her growing sense of despair

25:17.466 --> 25:21.866
over the deterioration of the health care system she labored in.

25:22.166 --> 25:28.866
She had actually become convinced that death might just be preferable

25:28.866 --> 25:31.766
to the level of care that she was able to provide.

25:31.766 --> 25:38.166
So convinced that if Brandon had not done what I had asked him to do,

25:38.366 --> 25:41.766
she would have secretly and purposefully euthanised

25:41.766 --> 25:44.834
16 patients before she was caught!

25:44.866 --> 25:46.666
We are talking about a child!

25:46.666 --> 25:47.666
It cannot continue!

25:47.666 --> 25:49.599
It must continue!

25:51.266 --> 25:55.866
You and I have done a lot of good together over the past few days

25:56.366 --> 25:59.666
We have put some terrible people in prison.

25:59.866 --> 26:02.766
That can continue, Mrs. Dubois.

26:02.833 --> 26:06.266
I'll keep sharing information with you, good information,

26:06.866 --> 26:11.666
but only if you allow my other work to go on unimpeded.

26:12.166 --> 26:14.732
That's what this is all about, isn't it?

26:14.866 --> 26:18.166
You knew I was dreaming about you and the boy.

26:18.166 --> 26:20.466
That's why you came to see me in the first place.

26:21.666 --> 26:26.966
Did you actually think that if you gave me enough information about criminals we weren't able to catch,

26:26.966 --> 26:29.966
that I would let you two keep murdering people?

26:32.466 --> 26:34.499
Good night, Agent Cooper.

26:41.131 --> 26:42.466
You won't be able to catch him.

26:42.466 --> 26:44.466
You won't be able to stop him.

26:44.466 --> 26:47.666
There'll be no evidence-- I'll make certain of that.

26:48.366 --> 26:49.833
I'm already in his head.

26:50.966 --> 26:52.265
You can't save him.

26:52.366 --> 26:54.998
There's virtually no "him" left to save.

26:55.666 --> 26:57.866
Why not reconsider?

26:57.966 --> 27:00.766
It's such an elegant arrangement.

27:01.866 --> 27:03.766
Promise me you'll sleep on it.

27:11.466 --> 27:13.966
Hey, Hal, when you're all settled in,

27:13.966 --> 27:16.733
I'd like to go over your plans for the dye sensitizer.

27:17.366 --> 27:19.966
See if we can't tie up a few loose ends.

27:21.566 --> 27:23.266
What's wrong with the plans I gave you?

27:23.466 --> 27:25.566
No, nothing. They helped a lot.

27:25.633 --> 27:29.266
But we still need to figure out how to get better absorption out of the semiconductor.

27:29.899 --> 27:34.366
And we need to address the electron recombination in the mediator level.

27:45.366 --> 27:46.700
May I?

28:05.667 --> 28:06.834
What's going on, Hal?

28:11.366 --> 28:13.466
I'm gonna be perfectly honest with you, Joe.

28:15.366 --> 28:18.705
I'm not really an office kind of a guy.

28:19.166 --> 28:22.300
I tend to do my very best work at my house.

28:22.366 --> 28:23.766
There are fewer distractions there,

28:23.766 --> 28:26.066
I can really focus on the problems that I need to solve,

28:26.066 --> 28:29.566
and if it's all the same to you, I'd really like to take these home with me

28:29.566 --> 28:33.366
and noodle with them there and bring you my absolute best

28:33.566 --> 28:37.433
as opposed to whatever I can muster here.

28:46.933 --> 28:49.200
Brandon? Brandon Whitman?

28:49.566 --> 28:51.299
My name's Allison.

28:51.366 --> 28:53.100
I'm friends with Agent Cooper.

28:56.166 --> 28:57.466
You're wrong. I don't know what you're talking about.

28:57.466 --> 28:58.666
I'm nothing like you.

28:58.733 --> 29:00.299
You're exactly like me.

29:00.666 --> 29:02.766
You can see him., so can I.

29:02.766 --> 29:05.433
The only difference is, I don't kill for him.

29:18.200 --> 29:19.433
Where is everybody?

29:21.266 --> 29:23.200
"Everyone" is my mom.

29:23.466 --> 29:27.200
Everyone's at work. And when everyone's not at work, everyone's with her boyfriend.

29:27.566 --> 29:31.566
So... what do you want? Why are you in my house?

29:31.633 --> 29:34.700
I work for the district attorney's office.

29:36.467 --> 29:38.067
I want to help you.

29:40.966 --> 29:42.266
I don't need any help.

29:42.266 --> 29:44.466
Yes, you do. You could be tried for murder.

29:44.466 --> 29:45.466
I don't think so,

29:45.466 --> 29:48.066
'cause all those people you keep talking about, they killed themselves.

29:48.066 --> 29:50.466
No, they decided to end their lives quickly

29:50.466 --> 29:53.533
rather than face the slow death you were threatening.

29:53.576 --> 29:54.876
Can you prove that?

29:59.067 --> 30:03.466
Hey, Brandon, I'm offering you a way out.

30:04.433 --> 30:06.533
Come with me to the district attorney's office.

30:06.666 --> 30:08.767
We will explain what happened.

30:09.266 --> 30:11.867
How you started hearing Cooper's voice in your head.

30:11.934 --> 30:14.066
How your mom tried to get you treatment and medication,

30:14.066 --> 30:15.766
but it didn't work.

30:16.066 --> 30:17.800
You're still a minor.

30:18.467 --> 30:20.567
The court will show you mercy.

30:21.466 --> 30:23.166
Mercy?

30:25.666 --> 30:27.133
They should give me a medal.

30:28.666 --> 30:30.766
Do you know how many lives I've saved?

30:30.766 --> 30:33.132
I go to school, I look at all the other kids.

30:33.666 --> 30:36.066
You know, the captain of the football team, the girl who stars in all the plays,

30:36.066 --> 30:37.766
and they're like the overachievers,

30:37.766 --> 30:40.366
the ones who get in all the good colleges; the one that everybody talks about.

30:40.366 --> 30:43.066
What have they done? Played a game, sang a song?

30:43.066 --> 30:44.066
<i>Look at what I do.</i>

30:45.266 --> 30:47.266
All the people in that diner were going to die.

30:47.266 --> 30:49.066
All the patients that woman cared for,

30:49.066 --> 30:50.166
she was gonna kill.

30:50.166 --> 30:51.666
And you're gonna stop us? Why?

30:51.666 --> 30:52.866
Because it's wrong.

30:52.866 --> 30:54.233
But it's not wrong!

31:02.166 --> 31:06.966
You know... when he first started appearing to me,

31:06.966 --> 31:09.866
I would ignore him; pretend I couldn't see.

31:11.366 --> 31:14.866
He was screaming at me about this guy in Scottsdale.

31:14.866 --> 31:16.900
Said he was depressed. Said he was gonna take his .38

31:16.900 --> 31:19.666
and shoot his wife and two kids right before he blew his own brains out.

31:20.966 --> 31:23.266
Agent Cooper asked me if I would do something about it.

31:23.266 --> 31:25.466
He said he'd show me how to get in the house,

31:25.466 --> 31:27.499
what to say, what to do.

31:28.866 --> 31:30.666
I just ignored him.

31:31.966 --> 31:34.566
The next day, I wake up, my mom's watching the news.

31:34.566 --> 31:35.966
"Murder-suicide in Scottsdale."

31:35.966 --> 31:38.566
Some guy snaps, kills his whole family.

31:39.866 --> 31:41.766
I could have saved them.

31:41.933 --> 31:43.133
No.

31:45.866 --> 31:47.432
You know I'm right.

31:47.432 --> 31:48.366
No, I don't.

31:48.366 --> 31:49.466
It's like he always says,

31:49.466 --> 31:51.632
"Just do the math."

31:52.066 --> 31:54.366
You kill one guilty person, you save two innocent ones.

31:54.366 --> 31:56.166
You kill 20, you save a hundred.

31:56.166 --> 31:58.866
You kill a hundred, you save a thousand.

31:59.266 --> 32:00.166
Do the math.

32:00.166 --> 32:02.266
This isn't math!

32:02.266 --> 32:03.666
This is something else.

32:03.666 --> 32:06.266
It's vigilantism, and it's wrong.

32:06.266 --> 32:09.666
No, it isn't.

32:11.099 --> 32:12.599
It's really kind of perfect.

32:14.666 --> 32:19.166
Anyway, you're gonna have to leave. I...

32:24.400 --> 32:26.333
Honey, you coming to bed?

32:26.700 --> 32:27.600
Yeah...

32:27.600 --> 32:28.700
someday.

32:30.200 --> 32:31.500
What if you can't do it?

32:31.500 --> 32:34.300
What if you can't come up with a solution that improves on Hal's?

32:34.300 --> 32:35.433
Don't say that.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.367
Don't even put that out there.

32:40.700 --> 32:41.900
Maybe I should just surrender.

32:41.900 --> 32:44.400
Maybe I should just get used to the fact that Hal--

32:44.400 --> 32:48.100
thieving, slimy, untrustworthy Hal

32:48.100 --> 32:50.900
is someone that I'm going to just have to see every day of my professional life.

32:51.600 --> 32:54.467
When and if he chooses to come into the office, that is.

32:56.900 --> 32:58.900
You all right if I stay out here for a bit?

32:59.200 --> 33:00.233
I'll see you soon.

33:04.300 --> 33:06.100
Daddy?

33:06.500 --> 33:08.033
- Daddy?
- Yeah.

33:08.800 --> 33:09.800
Ariel.

33:09.800 --> 33:11.300
Ariel, what'd you--

33:11.300 --> 33:12.634
what's going on? Everything all right?

33:13.300 --> 33:14.300
What time is it?

33:14.700 --> 33:16.200
Oh, God. What are you doing up?

33:16.300 --> 33:17.900
I don't know.

33:18.267 --> 33:20.900
It's like midnight or something.

33:21.900 --> 33:24.200
I had another dream about that Clay guy.

33:24.400 --> 33:26.135
He wanted me to tell you something.

33:26.700 --> 33:28.300
Oh you did? What?

33:28.600 --> 33:31.500
He wants you to look at something called the Mellinger Equation.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.600
"Mellinger Equation"?

33:33.801 --> 33:35.201
Do you mean Mallinger?

33:35.268 --> 33:36.900
Yeah.

33:36.900 --> 33:38.100
He says you're supposed to

33:38.100 --> 33:43.099
"apply 1-ethyl-3 and then extrapolate it from four vectors".

33:43.100 --> 33:44.199
What?

33:44.400 --> 33:48.600
He kept screaming it at me, until I promised I'd wake up and write it down.

33:56.666 --> 33:59.733
Why?

34:00.500 --> 34:01.966
Why did you leave?

34:16.100 --> 34:18.301
I just got off the phone with the hospital again.

34:18.800 --> 34:20.500
For the moment at least, he's, uh...

34:20.567 --> 34:21.833
he's still hanging on.

34:22.600 --> 34:23.800
I'll keep you posted.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.933
I appreciate that.

34:26.300 --> 34:28.000
It was in front of us the whole time, Terry.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.800
We just didn't see it.

34:30.300 --> 34:31.833
The Mallinger Equation.

34:32.100 --> 34:35.400
It really does solve all of our dye sensitizer problems.

34:36.199 --> 34:40.000
The key is applying it to a lighter photosensitive material,

34:40.000 --> 34:43.201
and then applying Mallinger to four additional surface vectors,

34:43.266 --> 34:46.600
thereby reducing the amount of external sensitization that's required.

34:46.600 --> 34:49.400
Thereby reducing our material costs by...

34:49.500 --> 34:51.500
What? Three, maybe four percent?

34:51.900 --> 34:53.534
It might even go so high as five.

34:56.900 --> 34:58.701
What can I say, Joe?

34:59.600 --> 35:03.700
I guess I underestimated just how much you dislike working with Hal Munzell.

35:03.900 --> 35:05.466
Are you on board with this?

35:07.200 --> 35:10.167
I'm a man of my word, Joe.

35:11.500 --> 35:13.900
Consider him gone.

35:14.000 --> 35:17.600
Well, if he ever comes back in the office, I'll be sure to let him know.

35:18.100 --> 35:19.300
That's great, Joe.

35:19.800 --> 35:23.000
Well, I guess sometimes things do work out the way they're supposed to.

35:24.933 --> 35:26.867
Soon, I hope.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.100
They're still operating.

35:28.100 --> 35:29.835
Devalos and I are just waiting.

35:33.600 --> 35:34.700
Joe, I gotta go.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.900
Tell the girls I'll be home in a bit.

35:41.600 --> 35:43.567
Douglas Reilly just expired.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.100
"Dear Joe, I made a decision

36:01.100 --> 36:03.000
to end my life tonight..."

36:03.000 --> 36:05.600
Hello again, Mrs. Dubois.

36:06.800 --> 36:07.933
Nice note, don't you think?

36:08.600 --> 36:09.933
I'm going to need you to sign that.

36:10.700 --> 36:15.400
By the way, I'm have a gun in my left hand which is pointed directly at the center of your spine.

36:16.300 --> 36:18.000
A single bullet at this close proximity,

36:18.000 --> 36:20.100
even allowing for it having to go through the rear of your seat,

36:20.100 --> 36:24.000
should disable but not kill you immediately, causing unimaginable pain.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.800
Brandon, don't do this.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.200
Sign the note,

36:28.200 --> 36:31.300
put the key in the ignition and drive to the roof.

36:44.900 --> 36:45.900
Brandon.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.700
Brandon.

36:47.700 --> 36:50.166
There are video cameras all over this lot.

36:50.233 --> 36:52.100
You're being recorded right now.

36:52.100 --> 36:53.000
Not tonight.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.767
The system's down.

36:54.900 --> 36:56.500
Will be until it's serviced tomorrow.

36:56.567 --> 36:57.800
Agent Cooper is very thorough.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.400
You ought to know that by now.

36:59.500 --> 37:02.066
Agent Cooper? This was his idea?

37:03.000 --> 37:04.400
Our work is very important.

37:04.700 --> 37:06.834
We can't let you get in the way of what we're trying to do.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.400
Now, I'm going to need you to climb up on that wall.

37:10.300 --> 37:12.000
I can't do that, Brandon.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.500
I think you will.

37:13.800 --> 37:15.300
I think you're going to climb up on that wall,

37:15.300 --> 37:17.200
and you're going to jump off it, 'cause if you don't,

37:17.200 --> 37:19.100
I will shoot you, Mrs. Dubois.

37:24.300 --> 37:26.400
You're going to have to shoot me.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.600
What's the matter?

37:32.500 --> 37:34.366
Didn't Cooper tell you this might happen?

37:34.500 --> 37:35.700
No he didn't, did he?

37:35.700 --> 37:36.900
'Cause he didn't know.

37:37.000 --> 37:40.200
Just like he didn't know about Douglas Reilly.

37:42.500 --> 37:44.200
Who's Douglas Reilly?

37:45.400 --> 37:47.500
I'm going to get....

37:51.600 --> 37:55.700
Douglas Reilly is a man who actually did commit suicide last night,

37:55.700 --> 37:58.600
and not because anybody was threatening him,

37:59.900 --> 38:02.100
but because he lost his wife,

38:02.500 --> 38:06.501
and he couldn't imagine spending another day without her.

38:07.200 --> 38:08.200
See him?

38:09.900 --> 38:12.600
His wife's name was Rachel Stetson.

38:16.200 --> 38:17.700
Okay...

38:20.700 --> 38:21.500
his wife was a killer.

38:21.500 --> 38:24.300
So, it's like Cooper says. Do the math.

38:24.300 --> 38:26.200
No, no, no. You do the math.

38:26.600 --> 38:30.067
His wife hadn't killed anybody.

38:30.200 --> 38:31.500
Anybody. Not yet.

38:31.500 --> 38:34.200
And I'm starting to think she probably never would have.

38:36.300 --> 38:37.834
Wait a second. What are you saying?

38:37.834 --> 38:40.500
I'm saying, honey, the future isn't fixed.

38:40.500 --> 38:41.500
It isn't certain.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.199
It is fluid.

38:43.200 --> 38:48.500
Agent Cooper couldn't have known that Rachel Stetson was going to kill all those people.

38:48.700 --> 38:51.100
Or that somebody wouldn't have discovered her.

38:51.100 --> 38:53.900
Or that she wouldn't have had a change of heart.

38:53.900 --> 38:55.500
Any more than he could have been certain that

38:55.500 --> 38:59.200
Adam Dietz was going to walk into that diner and blow everyone away.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.100
Who's to say that somebody wouldn't have stopped him?

39:03.100 --> 39:06.400
Who's to say that he wouldn't have stopped himself?

39:06.400 --> 39:08.100
No! No.

39:09.500 --> 39:10.500
No, he saw it.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.600
He, he knew it. He was certain of it.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.100
He even said you dreamt about it.

39:14.100 --> 39:16.101
I did. I did.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.500
My dreams are always, always fooling with me.

39:19.500 --> 39:21.600
You can-- you can call my husband.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.100
Call the people I work with.

39:24.300 --> 39:25.500
So what are you saying?

39:25.500 --> 39:26.533
I'm saying...

39:27.000 --> 39:29.500
do the math, Brandon.

39:30.500 --> 39:32.300
Cooper's using you.

39:32.900 --> 39:35.400
He wants you to think that he's infallible,

39:35.400 --> 39:36.800
but he isn't.

39:37.999 --> 39:41.600
I am never gonna jump off that wall.

39:43.100 --> 39:45.200
So, you're gonna have to kill me.

39:45.300 --> 39:46.800
No.

39:47.400 --> 39:48.834
Or better yet,

39:49.700 --> 39:50.899
give me that gun.

39:51.700 --> 39:54.400
Give me the gun, we're going to get back in the car,

39:54.400 --> 39:57.700
we'll drive downstairs, we'll talk to my boss.

39:57.700 --> 40:01.000
That's just not an option, Mrs. Dubois.

40:01.700 --> 40:03.300
We don't have much time. Pull the trigger, Brandon.

40:03.300 --> 40:07.500
We'll drive the car away, leave her here, make it look like a carjacking.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.367
Is what she's saying right?

40:09.700 --> 40:13.900
Is it possible that I forced those people to kill themselves for no reason at all?

40:13.900 --> 40:15.799
It's highly unlikely, Brandon.

40:16.400 --> 40:18.500
And we could hardly afford to wait

40:18.500 --> 40:20.733
and just let awful things happen.

40:20.733 --> 40:23.200
That would've defeated our entire purpose.

40:24.600 --> 40:26.034
Now pull the trigger.

40:26.099 --> 40:27.934
You said she was going to jump!

40:28.200 --> 40:30.000
Give me the gun, Brandon.

40:30.000 --> 40:33.200
If you don't kill her, she will arrest you.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.800
- And you will go to prison.
- I told you,

40:34.800 --> 40:36.166
we'll go talk to my boss.

40:36.233 --> 40:39.300
I believe that he will recommend that the court show you mercy.

40:39.399 --> 40:41.366
I wouldn't count on mercy, son.

40:41.800 --> 40:44.800
You've already had a hand in the deaths of three people.

40:47.100 --> 40:48.233
Now pull the trigger!

40:51.867 --> 40:53.133
There you go.

40:54.600 --> 40:56.133
Don't.

40:56.199 --> 40:59.066
Now, do what you have to do.

41:00.100 --> 41:04.900
There's no reason to feel doubt or uncertainty, Brandon.

41:05.367 --> 41:06.900
Brandon...

41:07.600 --> 41:09.700
he is using you.

41:10.300 --> 41:12.100
None of this is your fault.

41:12.300 --> 41:14.633
Don't listen to her, Brandon.

41:16.266 --> 41:18.233
What we're doing is right.

41:18.700 --> 41:20.867
We're making the world better.

41:21.934 --> 41:23.567
You'll see.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.833
Once you've actually pulled that trigger,

41:26.000 --> 41:28.466
everything will change.

41:28.700 --> 41:31.133
You'll feel wonderful.

41:33.800 --> 41:34.700
What are you doing?!

41:34.700 --> 41:35.700
Brandon, no!

41:42.900 --> 41:44.099
Where have you been?

41:44.300 --> 41:46.034
I've been worried about you.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.900
First I was at the hospital.

41:48.900 --> 41:51.801
And then I was talking to this, this boy's mother.

41:54.500 --> 41:56.334
And then....
