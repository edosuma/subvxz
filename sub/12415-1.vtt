01:47.750 --> 01:51.600
Hello, how are you darling? When will we see?

01:53.175 --> 01:57.705
I will not be ready by then. I have one last patient.

01:58.182 --> 02:01.677
I know it's late. But it is a new patient.

02:02.464 --> 02:05.061
I could not say no. He insisted so much.

02:05.604 --> 02:09.794
What could I do? I have healing powers in my hands.

02:11.733 --> 02:13.043
Yes, for you too, dear.

02:13.057 --> 02:14.383
But with you I am hard.

02:20.334 --> 02:22.432
Hello. Your Welcome. Pass.

02:22.572 --> 02:23.587
Before starting ...

02:23.624 --> 02:26.546
... I like having the history of my new patients.

02:26.582 --> 02:29.181
Please complete this form.

02:29.217 --> 02:32.398
Put your bag there. So we can start.

02:32.746 --> 02:37.058
As said by telephone, has herniated disc.

02:37.094 --> 02:38.747
I know it's very painful.

02:48.850 --> 02:51.066
Are you sure it's your first time?

02:52.037 --> 02:53.654
Has familiar face.

02:54.418 --> 02:56.272
And I never forget a face.

04:06.890 --> 04:09.479
-give Me your hand. -just Leave me alone.

04:10.242 --> 04:15.481
Come on, I can help. Do you want to kill you?

04:15.517 --> 04:16.487
Yup.

04:16.731 --> 04:20.524
No ... Come on, come ...

04:20.560 --> 04:25.372
I do not want your help. Let me go, please!

04:25.400 --> 04:28.574
-Oh Shit. -stay With me!

04:31.011 --> 04:35.225
Come on, stop fighting. Stop fighting, I can help.

04:35.253 --> 04:37.686
Not want to do this. -if I want to.

04:37.721 --> 04:41.363
Everything will be fine. Give me your hand.

04:41.400 --> 04:42.922
The hand ... I do not want.

04:44.740 --> 04:47.197
That's it. They Watch.

04:52.613 --> 04:53.500
What look?

04:53.501 --> 05:00.866
Your beautiful bracelet. Want to eat something?

05:00.902 --> 05:03.408
-and Had lunch. -an Ice cream?

05:03.444 --> 05:06.306
No, I have to go now. What's your hurry?

05:06.342 --> 05:08.219
What do you care? What do you care?

05:08.567 --> 05:11.993
We could go for a coffee. Do Not?

05:13.480 --> 05:18.080
Mind your own business. That all right.

05:22.156 --> 05:28.091
You do not worry. Get in the car. That all right.

05:32.597 --> 05:34.382
'There is. -Thx.

05:39.603 --> 05:41.574
You want this? -no Thanks.

05:42.753 --> 05:46.278
So what like me first?

05:47.976 --> 05:49.240
Both are rich.

05:49.380 --> 05:51.036
Not for me.

05:51.800 --> 05:52.994
You always distresses your parents well?

05:53.030 --> 05:54.267
I see my parents!

05:55.757 --> 05:59.727
'Do not you live with them? No, I live alone. I have a lot of money.

05:59.764 --> 06:01.437
How old are you? 14? 15?

06:01.473 --> 06:06.049
-16 Do you still go to school?

06:06.085 --> 06:10.333
Stop asking me questions. Basta. Huh?

06:11.616 --> 06:12.432
Sorry ...

06:15.966 --> 06:22.719
... Is that I also had marks as well.

06:22.754 --> 06:26.108
You do not know anything about me. Yeah I know.

06:26.144 --> 06:27.296
You do not now.

06:28.891 --> 06:30.826
If you have drug problems I can help you.

06:30.862 --> 06:33.712
I do not have drug problems. You Only ...

06:44.706 --> 06:45.689
Are you happy?

06:47.353 --> 06:49.535
Are you happy I'm eating?

06:49.743 --> 06:50.366
Yup

06:50.367 --> 06:53.802
Well, I go to the bathroom.

07:31.342 --> 07:33.180
One moment, we want to talk to you.

07:33.216 --> 07:34.756
I did nothing, they make a mistake.

07:34.813 --> 07:37.677
I study visit Romania.

07:37.741 --> 07:40.375
Looks like we were right. But committed no crime.

07:40.411 --> 07:41.907
We take you to the clinic Ferriday.

07:41.943 --> 07:45.022
-¡No! -Aura Petruscu, vamos.

07:45.059 --> 07:48.071
Do not take me there, I have a lot of money ...

07:48.211 --> 07:49.801
... I can give you thousands of dollars.

07:49.838 --> 07:52.329
Do not worry, we'll take you there.

07:52.433 --> 07:54.218
The law says we should take with your parents.

07:59.387 --> 08:02.781
-Help. -Déjenla Go.

08:04.998 --> 08:09.110
Relax, everything is under control. Walk.

08:24.859 --> 08:26.300
Home Sweet Home.

08:26.416 --> 08:32.203
Leave me alone! Let me go! Damn It!

08:41.015 --> 08:41.856
What do you want?

08:41.892 --> 08:43.898
Good evenning. We are Metro Youth Services.

08:44.142 --> 08:46.009
-Yes Y? We brought her daughter.

08:46.045 --> 08:48.720
Ah, my beautiful daughter.

08:52.356 --> 08:54.849
My beautiful girl.

08:55.819 --> 08:59.919
I am the mother of this difficult but beautiful girl.

09:00.579 --> 09:00.650
Thank you for bringing me back my baby.

09:00.686 --> 09:06.049
They have been very kind. Thank You.

09:10.797 --> 09:13.304
It was for your sake that you got in that clinic.

09:13.550 --> 09:16.891
There you will stay until we decide what to do.

09:17.447 --> 09:20.100
Let me go. I hate being there.

09:20.208 --> 09:22.621
Please do not make me go back. I will die.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.891
Stephan! Look who's back.

09:25.238 --> 09:31.399
Two policemen brought as a criminal.

09:32.890 --> 09:37.507
What a surprise. It always causes problems for your mother.

09:37.603 --> 09:40.354
Sorry, Daddy. But the clinic is horrible.

09:40.390 --> 09:42.091
I want to kill.

09:43.374 --> 09:46.992
Take her up and give her some tea ...

09:48.135 --> 09:49.174
... I wait inside.

09:50.248 --> 09:51.733
Come On.

09:58.523 --> 10:02.256
This is too much. Your mother is very angry.

10:02.454 --> 10:03.795
I know, Daddy. But let me stay here.

10:03.880 --> 10:05.640
-stop It. I swear I'll be better.

10:05.676 --> 10:07.195
Your mother has a lot to think about today.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.927
-Another Session spiritualist? -A Large.

10:12.428 --> 10:14.838
Then I'll take dinner.

10:14.874 --> 10:19.387
Try to eat. Make your mother is happy.

10:19.491 --> 10:22.954
-I Am not hungry. -Aura, You should eat.

10:22.991 --> 10:25.550
So you will return to the clinic.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.800
Good night, Stephan.

10:59.690 --> 11:02.451
I'm glad to see you. Give me your umbrella.

11:02.591 --> 11:05.869
It's a horrible night. But just like the spirits.

11:06.321 --> 11:11.265
She is very good. When Nicholas start talking.

11:11.406 --> 11:14.095
Look at my hands.

11:15.585 --> 11:18.191
I'm the one who called.

11:20.387 --> 11:22.283
Oh my goodness.

11:51.481 --> 11:53.048
Am I late?

12:26.518 --> 12:27.765
Will Get?

12:45.134 --> 12:46.143
Ask Question.

12:47.159 --> 12:49.538
Can we communicate with my mother?

12:49.574 --> 12:55.147
We have so many questions, we're here.

12:57.262 --> 13:04.753
Nicholas, my dear. You help us?

13:10.689 --> 13:15.388
Nicholas, are you here tonight?

13:18.895 --> 13:20.383
I'm looking for.

13:25.128 --> 13:28.671
Let me in.

13:29.492 --> 13:31.465
Let me in.

13:35.932 --> 13:42.115
This is not Nicholas. There is another spirit here.

13:43.203 --> 13:44.300
He is trying to enter.

13:50.059 --> 13:55.129
A soul that follows the newly dead ...

13:55.165 --> 13:59.084
... Who follow their murderers.

13:59.328 --> 14:00.440
Speaks ...

14:03.045 --> 14:05.746
My head.

14:06.785 --> 14:10.212
They took me head!

14:13.765 --> 14:16.619
A monster with a bow.

14:18.627 --> 14:31.197
I was not the first, nor will I be the last.

14:33.067 --> 14:37.326
I know who the murderer.

14:39.611 --> 14:43.871
Am I the only one who knows!

14:44.702 --> 14:46.987
The murderer is ...

14:47.402 --> 14:48.753
¡Presente!

14:54.770 --> 14:56.765
Do not break the chain.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.916
I see you!

14:59.994 --> 15:06.294
You can not hide from me! I know you.

15:09.920 --> 15:15.926
¡Mami! ¡Mami!

16:43.500 --> 16:46.485
You must have seen something. Who was?

16:47.004 --> 16:49.099
I did not see anything.

16:49.250 --> 16:50.900
If anything I saw.

16:52.163 --> 16:55.747
Had the heads in front of his face.

16:58.863 --> 17:04.680
Look at those strange things. Should be things of the occult.

17:05.771 --> 17:08.546
It's getting late. Bring me home.

17:11.789 --> 17:14.491
There was something wrong from the start. I sensed.

17:16.362 --> 17:17.957
Did not hear anything?

17:31.177 --> 17:34.052
Do you have another relative other than their parents?

17:34.089 --> 17:37.983
No, Captain. Until his recent escape was under ...

17:38.019 --> 17:41.969
-... My care. -for Real?

17:42.005 --> 17:45.171
It was my patient in Ferriday clinic.

17:45.207 --> 17:48.062
Her parents wanted there.

17:48.098 --> 17:49.707
What was it?

17:49.743 --> 17:52.365
No what I can say, Captain.

17:52.402 --> 17:55.035
But it has nothing to do with it.

17:55.071 --> 17:59.860
We take her back. Needs our help.

17:59.896 --> 18:04.395
Go to the center tomorrow and fill the forms ...

18:04.431 --> 18:06.567
... With youth services. Sure that the delivered ...

18:06.603 --> 18:09.831
... After the interrogate.

18:17.610 --> 18:20.650
Another strange double murder and you go insane 4.

18:20.686 --> 18:23.592
The striking steel workers renegotiated.

18:23.628 --> 18:26.663
Price increases damaged their pockets.

18:27.842 --> 18:29.598
It seems you could have fun with that.

18:29.634 --> 18:31.762
They call it the "Hunt-Heads".

18:32.318 --> 18:33.903
That I heard.

18:34.771 --> 18:36.287
I suppose you what Grace said.

18:36.739 --> 18:39.046
Yes, we talked occasionally.

18:39.082 --> 18:40.995
Then you will be told how he is.

18:41.966 --> 18:44.178
Do not worry Mark, nobody saw.

18:44.201 --> 18:48.001
What comic, you're very funny.

18:48.037 --> 18:50.808
Now can we work?

18:50.844 --> 18:54.589
Do you you do Arnie, plus fat?

18:55.769 --> 19:00.689
We have a main compound using the KKK last night ...

19:00.726 --> 19:03.424
... Landing ship ...

19:03.937 --> 19:08.493
... And the president's trip to Belgrade.

19:08.494 --> 19:08.946
Is there sex?

19:08.982 --> 19:12.023
It is probable, the first lady will not go.

19:12.059 --> 19:15.368
Forget it. I think there was sex in the Tour de France. OK?

19:15.786 --> 19:19.362
God will not appear in front of it.

19:19.813 --> 19:20.848
Welcome Grace.

19:21.093 --> 19:23.750
Can not we do something more stylish?

19:23.787 --> 19:27.006
I did this. But not yet finished.

19:27.109 --> 19:28.807
That's better. -is Not it.

19:28.924 --> 19:31.764
I'd rather have just written something.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.240
Maybe "Hunt-Heads"

19:33.446 --> 19:35.210
-what A great idea. -Originalísimo.

19:36.285 --> 19:40.926
I have to go back. Ben wants you to review the ads.

19:46.655 --> 19:49.502
Grace, which is that suit you well.

19:49.539 --> 19:52.046
'I know we can give. I what?

19:52.082 --> 19:54.505
Great lyrics written as blood.

19:54.541 --> 19:56.299
3 meters high.

20:02.679 --> 20:05.597
Hi Yes. Speaks him.

20:08.081 --> 20:09.976
Of course I love her. Where the hell are you?

20:12.903 --> 20:16.600
I only got $ 6 to eat.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.878
I was wandering all night.

20:19.953 --> 20:20.913
How you find me?

20:21.053 --> 20:25.150
For your document. First I called your house.

20:25.637 --> 20:27.986
'Are not you go? -Do Not.

20:29.740 --> 20:31.074
Looking for a place to stay?

20:31.110 --> 20:37.955
No, I need something more. Would you want to help me?

20:39.142 --> 20:40.969
You Need some more money? -Do Not.

20:42.882 --> 20:43.761
So what?

20:46.725 --> 20:48.198
I want to go home.

20:49.845 --> 20:52.427
Want to go home? I'll take you.

20:54.308 --> 20:56.307
Come to my office and call your parents.

20:56.308 --> 20:57.558
Everything's gonna be all right.

21:03.347 --> 21:05.425
Will not you raise and call your parents?

21:08.541 --> 21:17.162
Okay, I will go find my keys. Wait for me?

21:17.742 --> 21:21.008
There were two other victims beheaded last night ...

21:21.044 --> 21:23.873
... In a house opposite the park Inhamus the north.

21:23.909 --> 21:26.401
The victims were two professional spiritualists.

21:26.437 --> 21:27.818
Stephan y Adrianne Petrescu.

21:27.855 --> 21:32.632
Captain Travis, Do victims are random or is there a pattern?

21:32.669 --> 21:35.699
We know that all were paralyzed by a stroke ...

21:35.735 --> 21:38.482
... And were aware during the murder.

21:38.519 --> 21:40.442
Do you see that never shows any of those idiots?

21:40.687 --> 21:42.188
I'm going out for a while.

21:42.224 --> 21:45.424
Immigrants from Romania, 10 years ...

21:45.461 --> 21:47.409
... And had an only daughter, Aura, 16.

21:47.556 --> 21:48.581
Tell Grace I had to leave.

21:49.241 --> 21:51.098
I have a very good track for a note.

21:51.134 --> 21:53.677
The child is reported missing since last night.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.872
Aura, why you wanna go home?

21:57.908 --> 21:59.754
I need some clothes.

22:01.037 --> 22:02.117
How did you know my name?

22:03.025 --> 22:04.518
I saw it on the news ...

22:06.764 --> 22:08.400
... I'm sorry ...

22:09.880 --> 22:12.373
... I can not imagine how you feel.

22:12.854 --> 22:16.215
Do not have relatives who can stay?

22:16.251 --> 22:18.400
It's not your business.

22:19.438 --> 22:24.045
I just wanted to help. I do not need your help.

22:24.081 --> 22:26.630
I do not think we should go home.

22:27.541 --> 22:29.098
I think you should see a doctor.

22:29.099 --> 22:34.388
Doctor! I will not see more doctors!

22:35.851 --> 22:40.671
I just sneak one, I do not need another.

22:43.136 --> 22:47.915
I need answers. I want to know who killed my parents.

22:52.056 --> 22:53.927
Stop here. No stations nearby.

23:45.548 --> 23:50.222
No light, must be in the storm last night.

23:53.755 --> 23:55.417
Are you sure you wanna do this?

23:55.769 --> 23:57.019
Yup.

23:58.637 --> 24:00.819
Okay. Where is the basement?

24:01.030 --> 24:03.096
This way.

24:20.892 --> 24:22.013
I think it's there.

24:32.083 --> 24:32.794
So Perfect.

24:37.236 --> 24:38.939
Be right back.

25:41.703 --> 25:44.738
Mom. ¡Mami!

25:59.500 --> 26:03.025
... I will not be the last.

26:05.103 --> 26:08.982
I know who the murderer.

26:11.336 --> 26:15.741
Am I the only one who knows!

26:16.635 --> 26:19.019
The murderer is ...

26:19.020 --> 26:21.474
¡Presente!

26:24.529 --> 26:29.572
I almost did not recognize her. -to Who?

26:31.169 --> 26:37.381
My mom. It is the first time I hear this.

26:40.227 --> 26:43.968
All right.

27:09.926 --> 27:10.930
Come On! Come On!

27:20.268 --> 27:21.143
What happened?

27:21.179 --> 27:22.820
Someone broke my window.

27:23.607 --> 27:26.119
It should be a warning. Damn It!

27:26.406 --> 27:27.292
The police!

27:29.328 --> 27:30.582
Stay down.

27:44.573 --> 27:47.631
Hi, I was told that you have a great note for me.

27:47.667 --> 27:50.923
Do you want to put on my land?

27:50.959 --> 27:54.177
Call me at the station if you return before 10.

27:54.213 --> 27:58.614
Then I'm in the air again. Goodbye Bye.

28:43.236 --> 28:46.024
Gabriel, what do you do? Go to sleep.

28:46.788 --> 28:50.859
Mami, the woman of the house looks at me all the time.

28:50.895 --> 28:53.638
-It Does not move. -go To bed.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.392
There is no woman there.

29:16.264 --> 29:22.223
Yes there is. He is looking. It is a black lady.

29:22.399 --> 29:27.398
Sorry to call so late, Mr. Ferriday. But I was not.

29:27.435 --> 29:31.018
We had a board meeting. I'll talk to you ...

29:31.458 --> 29:33.216
... About the girl that got away.

29:33.357 --> 29:34.926
Aura Petruscu.

29:35.170 --> 29:38.416
Dr. Judd, the clinic does not need the publicity.

29:38.453 --> 29:43.301
Let me, Mr. Ferriday. I'll find her.

29:45.231 --> 29:47.556
My head.

29:49.053 --> 29:52.697
They took me head!

30:08.657 --> 30:09.239
Hello

30:09.380 --> 30:13.213
I was thinking to go home tonight.

30:14.208 --> 30:16.559
No, not tonight, Grace.

30:16.594 --> 30:18.086
Do not you want me?

30:21.740 --> 30:26.745
There is another person here. He's sleeping in the other room.

30:26.885 --> 30:28.475
Is it someone I know?

30:29.588 --> 30:35.652
No, it's just a girl who did not know where to spend the night.

30:35.689 --> 30:40.074
Good-bye, then. Grace.

31:31.825 --> 31:32.865
He said I was anorexic.

31:35.607 --> 31:36.614
I would not have imagined.

31:36.858 --> 31:40.809
Do not beat yourself. Anorexics keep their secrets.

31:40.845 --> 31:43.568
Behave, hide their problems.

31:44.331 --> 31:47.872
Are you serious? What else?

31:47.909 --> 31:52.382
Well, they are very attached to an unstable mother.

31:53.354 --> 31:56.948
They are upper middle class girls. Boys too.

31:56.984 --> 31:58.944
In general they are the brightest and artistic.

31:59.604 --> 32:03.248
What else? How could I forget? Sex.

32:03.284 --> 32:06.331
What about sex? Did you sleep with her?

32:06.367 --> 32:07.726
Annie is just a child.

32:07.762 --> 32:09.997
-Same, Did you? -Do Not!

32:10.033 --> 32:13.689
I thought so. Anorexics are afraid of sex.

32:13.726 --> 32:17.368
Want to go back to his childhood. A when there was fear.

32:17.405 --> 32:19.430
There are about 8 million patients.

32:19.882 --> 32:20.944
How do you know all this?

32:20.980 --> 32:24.009
Why Talk-Shows looked like everyone else.

32:24.045 --> 32:25.523
I do not look.

32:25.559 --> 32:26.922
There's your problem.

32:27.204 --> 32:31.273
This is television! You can not go well and ...

32:31.517 --> 32:34.742
You should see it and eat it.

32:34.779 --> 32:36.961
This is a way to let anorexia.

32:38.348 --> 32:41.472
Seriously. Your friend may be in danger.

32:41.509 --> 32:44.571
Many anorexics die. Commit suicide.

32:45.438 --> 32:47.611
The worst is that she will not leave your help.

32:47.855 --> 32:50.389
She wants your help but leave you.

32:51.464 --> 32:53.409
How did you get that?

32:53.764 --> 32:55.622
Problems with parents.

32:55.658 --> 32:58.532
Are said to have a recurring dream ...

32:58.568 --> 33:00.992
... Where his father were about to kiss.

33:14.795 --> 33:17.072
Concaliaconmisia.

33:23.945 --> 33:25.363
Teliapolytheus

37:20.109 --> 37:21.584
Talk to you soon ...

37:27.879 --> 37:29.128
Grace, ¿me perdonas?

37:29.165 --> 37:31.115
That girl is just a name?

37:31.667 --> 37:32.202
Yup.

37:32.893 --> 37:34.770
I do not see very safe.

37:34.806 --> 37:36.705
Believe me, I do not hide anything.

37:36.741 --> 37:38.628
Are you coming to dinner tonight?

37:39.899 --> 37:41.482
Maybe, maybe.

37:43.698 --> 37:44.512
Hola como andas?

37:44.776 --> 37:48.770
David, are you? I continue to see that scene in my mind

37:50.372 --> 37:52.945
Well, I'm back. Do you need anything?

37:53.150 --> 37:55.240
No, I recently ate

37:56.069 --> 37:59.658
-for Real? -Yup. And you do not know the mess I left in the kitchen.

37:59.664 --> 38:03.458
I made roast chicken and chips.

38:03.732 --> 38:08.200
Now I feel full, I'm tired and want to go to sleep

38:08.201 --> 38:10.821
Aura, I'm a little worried about you.

38:11.007 --> 38:12.752
No, do not tell me that.

38:12.788 --> 38:14.982
See you soon. Chau.

38:30.293 --> 38:32.870
Just cook the food. There must be some progress.

38:33.218 --> 38:36.126
No, you're probably lying, David.

38:36.175 --> 38:39.075
They are not easy to cure. So many die.

38:43.158 --> 38:44.984
Many anorexics commit suicide.

38:48.985 --> 38:51.000
There are about 8,000,000 of them.

38:57.329 --> 38:59.560
Very attached to an unstable mother.

39:02.485 --> 39:05.985
It will dream that his father is about to kiss her.

40:11.522 --> 40:14.262
-what Was that? Not heard anything.

40:15.094 --> 40:16.022
I'll see.

40:29.264 --> 40:32.315
-what Was it? -he Left.

40:32.708 --> 40:36.013
So? I'll go for it.

40:36.129 --> 40:39.883
Do not be ridiculous. You can not shoquear so easily.

40:39.945 --> 40:42.459
Let Grace. It's just a girl.

40:42.495 --> 40:45.499
Te is exploding. As everyone else.

40:46.367 --> 40:49.489
Believe me Grace. Need help. It wants to commit suicide.

40:49.559 --> 40:52.495
It was in the damn clinic Ferriday whole last month.

40:52.589 --> 40:54.783
Does the Ferriday clinic? You Joke.

40:55.060 --> 40:57.375
The mistreated. But he escaped.

40:58.002 --> 41:01.970
It is a manipulative crazy. Let her go.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.242
Fuck you, Grace.

41:04.321 --> 41:09.756
David, David. Damn It!

42:32.119 --> 42:36.574
Sorry about last night. Do not want to leave.

42:37.600 --> 42:38.745
Are you angry with me?

42:39.075 --> 42:43.870
-Not, do you are you? No, I'm not angry.

42:43.907 --> 42:46.213
Good, because I have to go to work.

42:47.229 --> 42:47.908
I because?

42:48.568 --> 42:51.231
Because I have to pretend to be a normal person.

42:53.486 --> 42:59.808
Go to the market and buy fruits and vegetables that you like.

43:00.572 --> 43:04.648
Ok T. I'll make a delicious meal.

44:11.598 --> 44:14.740
Watching TV will get everything.

44:14.776 --> 44:18.951
The 18, 23 and 29. Do not you realize?

44:20.240 --> 44:23.811
... Only God kills when it rains.

44:26.453 --> 44:28.016
Stay away from the rain.

44:29.618 --> 44:32.752
If you wait. A time.

44:32.789 --> 44:35.114
It is for you, your new girlfriend.

44:39.717 --> 44:44.030
David, went to the market and saw Dr. Judd.

44:44.274 --> 44:45.215
He followed me and I ...

44:46.455 --> 44:50.276
No, let me go!

45:07.472 --> 45:08.642
Will Get?

45:11.637 --> 45:12.542
¿Aura? Are you there?

45:17.321 --> 45:18.292
Will Get?

45:21.029 --> 45:22.357
He is not here.

45:23.720 --> 45:25.058
How do you know that is not here?

45:25.415 --> 45:31.886
I was worried about you and her.

45:32.130 --> 45:35.193
You yourself said he wanted to commit suicide.

45:36.137 --> 45:40.311
So I did what any responsible person.

45:42.228 --> 45:47.510
I called Ferriday. They will know help her.

45:47.547 --> 45:49.036
Did you call the clinic?

45:49.263 --> 45:55.326
I hope you're happy!

46:01.869 --> 46:04.777
I did not think would meet again so soon.

46:05.048 --> 46:09.649
Is it because I'm charming?

46:09.685 --> 46:15.001
You can go. Miss. Petruscu is an old friend.

46:16.492 --> 46:21.846
Aura is alone now and I must take care.

46:21.882 --> 46:26.113
All up to you.

46:26.149 --> 46:29.536
If you're willing to see inside you ...

46:29.573 --> 46:32.610
... And face the past.

46:32.646 --> 46:36.376
You are not interested in me. Want something more.

46:36.413 --> 46:39.702
I want you to get better. That I want.

46:39.739 --> 46:45.087
But the secret is there.

46:45.970 --> 46:47.512
Do not worry.

46:49.146 --> 46:52.569
I'll reveal one thing.

46:52.615 --> 46:58.997
The head of each human being contains the soul ...

46:59.034 --> 47:03.215
... The only puzzle that is the universe.

47:03.655 --> 47:07.596
Look inside your head. Opens memory.

47:08.572 --> 47:13.486
And the universe will open as a map.

47:16.487 --> 47:21.829
Aura, do you see this?

47:25.021 --> 47:27.456
It will help you remember everything.

47:28.121 --> 47:29.081
What is it?

47:29.118 --> 47:33.503
A very rare arrears. A psychotropic very strong.

47:33.743 --> 47:35.854
It is a drug. I do not want drugs.

47:35.994 --> 47:38.348
It is not a drug. Work with memory.

47:38.653 --> 47:42.229
Clears obstacles.

47:43.209 --> 47:48.295
Do not worry. Come on, take it.

47:48.331 --> 47:55.470
Squeeze Mulberry teeth and drink the juice.

47:55.471 --> 47:56.951
No, I beg you.

47:58.907 --> 48:06.720
That's it. Now squeeze it.

48:06.756 --> 48:09.904
The power of your brain and your imagination ...

48:09.940 --> 48:13.217
... They are stronger than a volcano.

49:02.052 --> 49:05.151
Carry on.

49:31.030 --> 49:33.466
Now I remember. It was you.

49:34.484 --> 49:36.739
Carry on.

49:39.057 --> 49:41.176
I do not want to.

49:55.611 --> 50:03.137
His face ... behind the heads of mommy and daddy.

50:03.173 --> 50:06.404
The face of who? You saw her.

50:06.440 --> 50:09.841
The face of who, Aura?

50:09.877 --> 50:13.855
-I Did not see anything. 'Do I think.

50:13.892 --> 50:15.641
It's the truth.

50:28.290 --> 50:29.367
Damn It!

50:41.275 --> 50:46.275
Take her to her room.

50:46.277 --> 50:49.580
No, leave me alone.

50:54.581 --> 50:56.684
Denlen painkillers.

51:00.677 --> 51:03.753
Please let me go.

52:40.678 --> 52:41.831
Responds you.

52:44.012 --> 52:46.485
Please do not.

52:50.253 --> 52:55.898
Try not to move. Should metérta vein.

52:59.865 --> 53:03.616
Save you I can hurt your arm. Be good.

53:09.142 --> 53:10.587
Good night.

53:13.119 --> 53:14.503
Come On.

53:14.539 --> 53:18.528
Stay still.

53:24.287 --> 53:26.122
Be still treasure.

53:40.028 --> 53:41.481
Okay. That's it.

55:12.340 --> 55:16.070
Looking for Aura Petruscu. What room are you?

55:16.106 --> 55:19.551
I can not give you that information.

55:19.587 --> 55:21.380
In addition, visiting hours are over.

55:22.607 --> 55:23.870
All right.

55:32.650 --> 55:37.729
Where were you? I do not want to hear excuses.

55:37.853 --> 55:40.892
It was in service ...

56:30.721 --> 56:31.478
Keys.

56:34.013 --> 56:34.472
God.

58:25.977 --> 58:29.360
It's me. Are you okay?

58:29.396 --> 58:31.180
Me drogaron.

58:33.981 --> 58:37.953
'Where did you get? -The Stole.

58:37.990 --> 58:44.790
Wait here. Are you going to be okay?

58:44.827 --> 58:50.911
I'll see what happens. Stay here.

59:20.821 --> 59:38.193
You. did it! You. did it!

59:38.229 --> 59:40.035
Let's get outta here!

01:00:47.512 --> 01:00:50.811
Tonight, the Ferriday clinic was the scene ...

01:00:50.847 --> 01:00:53.254
... A series of horrific beheadings.

01:00:53.290 --> 01:00:57.624
Aura, Aura, come here.

01:00:57.660 --> 01:01:01.321
They killed anyone in the Ferriday clinic. I knew it!

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:03.978
It was ... my nurse.

01:01:04.074 --> 01:01:04.899
Are you sure?

01:01:06.648 --> 01:01:12.086
He worked with Dr. Judd. She was the one who shot me.

01:01:12.122 --> 01:01:14.679
Did you hear something? Did you see anything? -Do Not.

01:01:25.866 --> 01:01:28.757
Wherever you go, people die.

01:01:29.417 --> 01:01:33.305
Come on, you're not responsible for their deaths.

01:01:33.341 --> 01:01:35.367
The director of the clinic, Dr. Leopold Judd ...

01:01:35.403 --> 01:01:37.477
... Was not available for comment.

01:01:37.514 --> 01:01:41.749
You're not a killer. You're a thief.

01:01:41.785 --> 01:01:45.317
On the local scene, the weather is improving.

01:01:45.551 --> 01:01:49.167
-what Is this? -The Keys to the nurse.

01:01:51.803 --> 01:01:53.211
It's all my fault.

01:01:59.381 --> 01:02:04.937
"Marigold" I know that place. Is a deposit.

01:02:15.823 --> 01:02:19.263
It's time to turn off the TV and go to bed.

01:02:19.423 --> 01:02:21.657
I want you're sleeping for when you arrive.

01:02:22.796 --> 01:02:25.082
Not afraid to go to sleep alone. Do Not?

01:02:25.437 --> 01:02:30.199
No, Mommy. Good-bye, I love you.

01:03:31.863 --> 01:03:34.783
He had his head.

01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:38.893
I did not see anything. It's the truth.

01:03:53.263 --> 01:03:54.717
Maybe the police were already here.

01:03:54.753 --> 01:03:58.165
It is not possible. How will you know about this site?

01:03:58.202 --> 01:04:01.845
They're going to find. You see something in the house Hilda ...

01:04:01.882 --> 01:04:06.887
... A key or a receipt. Let's not waste our time.

01:04:10.104 --> 01:04:15.089
Seven years ago this home is rented by the same person.

01:04:15.328 --> 01:04:20.770
And sometimes they come here they can count on the fingers of one hand.

01:05:01.466 --> 01:05:03.327
The police! Let'S Get Going! Come on now!

01:05:07.517 --> 01:05:10.480
Wait, the key! That's grip police.

01:05:11.884 --> 01:05:15.582
Mira. This is strange. They're all dead.

01:05:16.865 --> 01:05:22.527
OMG ... she is dead. She and her too.

01:05:22.564 --> 01:05:26.223
"Dear Hilda, in memory of the crazy times we had ...

01:05:26.342 --> 01:05:28.145
... With Love, Linda "

01:05:28.701 --> 01:05:30.450
She must be Linda.

01:05:32.082 --> 01:05:35.525
"Linda Quirk. 992, calle Benton."

01:05:35.561 --> 01:05:39.506
He lives near here. At least alive when they took the picture.

01:05:39.527 --> 01:05:41.068
What is this?

01:05:43.354 --> 01:05:46.161
Looks like a badge.

01:05:46.405 --> 01:05:48.952
I think he is the murderer. The Doctor.

01:05:49.715 --> 01:05:51.844
How do you know? She could be the killer.

01:05:51.845 --> 01:05:53.919
Not likely.

01:05:54.371 --> 01:05:56.389
Do not know what a murderer.

01:05:56.425 --> 01:06:04.143
I'll give this to the police ... anonymously.

01:06:04.699 --> 01:06:07.007
Tomorrow will be too late.

01:06:10.832 --> 01:06:16.085
Alice knew. Also Katherine and Georgia ...

01:06:16.121 --> 01:06:17.838
... Why I have so much fear.

01:06:17.874 --> 01:06:19.168
All we were stuck in that.

01:06:19.204 --> 01:06:21.388
-in What? -In An accident.

01:06:22.288 --> 01:06:23.822
Before you met me?

01:06:25.384 --> 01:06:30.146
ECT was my specialty.

01:06:31.111 --> 01:06:32.696
Was treatment of shock?

01:06:33.252 --> 01:06:35.785
I thought I knew all about it.

01:06:36.654 --> 01:06:39.052
Including how to make people forget everything.

01:06:39.977 --> 01:06:46.102
Quirk, Quirk ... there it is.

01:06:46.138 --> 01:06:50.039
Is L. Quirk. But there is another street.

01:06:50.116 --> 01:06:52.610
But what did you do?

01:06:52.646 --> 01:06:55.842
Something horrible.

01:06:58.056 --> 01:07:02.183
I do not know how we free ourselves from this.

01:07:06.023 --> 01:07:07.848
-Hello. -¿Linda Quirk?

01:07:07.885 --> 01:07:12.230
A time. It is a type. Question for you.

01:07:17.374 --> 01:07:19.798
-Hello. I'm looking for Linda Quirk.

01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:22.234
I because? Who is speaking?

01:07:22.686 --> 01:07:24.865
Know Hilda Volkman?

01:07:28.946 --> 01:07:30.659
He hung up.

01:07:30.695 --> 01:07:32.346
Try again.

01:07:48.617 --> 01:07:50.009
It's her.

01:07:52.582 --> 01:07:53.520
We'd better go there.

01:07:55.879 --> 01:07:59.999
-there Is it. -are Them.

01:08:08.952 --> 01:08:10.741
Come here! Come here!

01:08:10.777 --> 01:08:14.896
-What wants rays? Just want to talk.

01:08:45.002 --> 01:08:50.252
Damn, do not see it. -Doblemos Left.

01:08:52.613 --> 01:08:54.381
I go to the right.

01:09:10.107 --> 01:09:13.265
Damn, we lost! -turn Around.

01:09:43.819 --> 01:09:46.205
There it is. In the parking lot.

01:09:46.242 --> 01:09:48.648
I knew.

01:09:54.967 --> 01:09:56.260
-he Needs something?

01:09:56.297 --> 01:10:01.984
I'm looking for a lady who came earlier.

01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:03.086
Does your name?

01:10:03.642 --> 01:10:05.274
Quirk. Linda Quirk.

01:10:05.310 --> 01:10:07.747
We have no registered with that name.

01:10:07.783 --> 01:10:09.435
I wonder, he said he'd be here.

01:10:09.471 --> 01:10:12.879
Probably still not arrived. Want a room?

01:10:13.105 --> 01:10:24.054
Ah, sí, Maclin Edd, 140,
Weyslon Street, Onkpark.

01:10:24.090 --> 01:10:26.796
I want a room overlooking the parking lot.

01:10:26.833 --> 01:10:28.242
¿When parking?

01:10:28.278 --> 01:10:30.376
Yup.

01:10:35.322 --> 01:10:37.462
Did I notice it's there?

01:10:38.089 --> 01:10:39.733
Do not let.

01:10:45.886 --> 01:10:47.474
From here we can watch her.

01:10:47.822 --> 01:10:50.715
Do you think it will rain?

01:10:52.475 --> 01:10:55.470
It's a beautiful day. Sure not.

01:10:59.258 --> 01:11:00.558
Linda? Are you?

01:11:00.594 --> 01:11:02.047
Thank God you're okay.

01:11:02.084 --> 01:11:06.450
I'm in a hotel. I want you to come now.

01:11:06.486 --> 01:11:09.822
Peace Out. React too strong.

01:11:09.859 --> 01:11:13.654
Were just kids. They did not seem dangerous.

01:11:13.691 --> 01:11:15.175
You are very Influenced as.

01:11:15.211 --> 01:11:18.158
I do not know who they were. I just know I'm in danger.

01:11:18.195 --> 01:11:20.309
And you too if you're in my house.

01:11:20.346 --> 01:11:22.255
Please come here.

01:11:22.291 --> 01:11:25.717
Better call the police.

01:11:25.753 --> 01:11:27.628
Discuss this when you arrive.

01:11:27.665 --> 01:11:29.972
All right. Where are you?

01:11:30.008 --> 01:11:34.003
In Hopkins House. Room 301. Near the airport.

01:11:36.223 --> 01:11:38.057
-I'm Going there. -be Careful.

01:12:40.236 --> 01:12:43.583
-¿David? -What's The matter?

01:12:43.931 --> 01:12:47.530
Nothing, just wanted to know if you were there.

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:04.985
-I Sure do. Well, now go.

01:13:05.021 --> 01:13:06.139
I because?

01:13:06.175 --> 01:13:08.565
Because I do not want to get wet.

01:13:24.426 --> 01:13:27.283
Hi, yes, to rise.

01:15:38.322 --> 01:15:40.594
Be ...

01:15:41.939 --> 01:15:44.760
Lloyd.

01:16:07.178 --> 01:16:10.661
-¿El Doctor Lloyd? Do you still work here?

01:16:11.009 --> 01:16:13.823
No, it was long ago.

01:16:13.859 --> 01:16:19.667
But he returned a few years ago and looked terrible.

01:16:20.777 --> 01:16:26.121
He fled with medicine clinic, if I understand.

01:16:26.469 --> 01:16:29.721
Yes I understand. Do you know where can I find it?

01:16:29.757 --> 01:16:34.065
The last I heard of him is that he lived in the district of deposits.

01:16:34.101 --> 01:16:36.964
You can search bars.

01:16:37.831 --> 01:16:39.183
Good thanks.

01:17:00.355 --> 01:17:03.137
She's Hilda Volkman. Worked here.

01:17:04.836 --> 01:17:06.413
And Linda Quirk.

01:17:06.449 --> 01:17:10.192
Harry, I know who are women. Who is he?

01:17:10.228 --> 01:17:13.782
Dr. Lloyd. What curious.

01:17:13.818 --> 01:17:17.720
A guy just now came with the same photo.

01:17:17.756 --> 01:17:19.110
What did you say to him?

01:17:19.146 --> 01:17:21.105
I sent it to the warehouse district.

01:18:07.287 --> 01:18:08.983
Want something?

01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:10.031
Are you Dr. Lloyd?

01:18:10.067 --> 01:18:12.643
Perhaps I was in another life.

01:18:12.705 --> 01:18:14.113
Do you have money?

01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:18.210
No, but Linda Quirk, Hilda Volkman, ...

01:18:18.247 --> 01:18:19.563
... Did these names sound?

01:18:19.599 --> 01:18:21.345
¿Katherine Duran? ¿Georgia Jackson?

01:18:21.382 --> 01:18:24.054
-leave Me alone. They're dead. Did you know?

01:18:24.091 --> 01:18:25.754
People die every day.

01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:28.353
'They were decapitated. I what?

01:18:28.764 --> 01:18:31.190
I said we were beheaded.

01:18:31.434 --> 01:18:35.557
God ... that's not my fault.

01:18:35.594 --> 01:18:38.708
Let Doctor Lloyd. You must tell me something.

01:18:38.744 --> 01:18:39.880
It is too late.

01:18:40.872 --> 01:18:42.374
You must know something.

01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:46.188
Do Not! Leave me alone!

01:18:48.907 --> 01:18:52.220
This is my phone. Call me if you change your mind.

01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:45.768
This used to be a nice neighborhood.

01:22:46.892 --> 01:22:52.459
That's all I had, a phone number: David.

01:22:57.104 --> 01:22:58.020
What's this?

01:23:07.269 --> 01:23:10.684
I'm here. I'll take you back.

01:23:13.113 --> 01:23:20.343
Aura, come with me.

01:23:22.409 --> 01:23:41.494
'What happens there! Enough! Help me!

01:24:35.062 --> 01:24:39.865
I used to love her. I used to love her.

01:24:56.895 --> 01:24:59.102
Come see this.

01:25:01.002 --> 01:25:03.572
Stay there, you can not pass.

01:25:04.024 --> 01:25:06.062
Come on, muévase.

01:25:06.099 --> 01:25:07.612
All right.

01:25:42.476 --> 01:25:43.979
"Dear David, went to join with my mom ...

01:25:44.431 --> 01:25:48.452
... Forgive Me. I'll always love. "

01:25:51.689 --> 01:25:54.831
Aura returns!

01:26:14.622 --> 01:26:16.500
¿Aura? Go Back!

01:26:20.250 --> 01:26:23.250
Will Have !. Will Have !.

01:27:28.837 --> 01:27:30.370
Sálvenla.

01:27:30.406 --> 01:27:33.368
-what Does he say? I think "Save her"

01:27:33.405 --> 01:27:34.983
A little late for that.

01:27:35.019 --> 01:27:39.170
Sálvenla, sálvenla.

01:27:39.669 --> 01:27:43.233
The terror of "Hunting-Heads" that threatened the city ...

01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:45.551
... Ended this morning when an old Cadillac ...

01:27:45.587 --> 01:27:50.352
... Crashed near Lake Veronica.

01:27:50.388 --> 01:27:54.517
The driver, Dr. Leopold Judd, died on the spot ...

01:27:54.553 --> 01:27:57.088
The severed heads of all his victims ...

01:27:57.124 --> 01:27:59.241
... Were in the trunk of his car.

01:27:59.278 --> 01:28:03.288
Ben Aldridge was there and spoke with the police.

01:28:03.948 --> 01:28:06.388
Captain Travis, Will the Doctor Judd was the murderer?

01:28:06.424 --> 01:28:10.342
The evidence we found it connects to the murders.

01:28:10.379 --> 01:28:11.564
What was his motive?

01:28:12.431 --> 01:28:15.977
Looks like he was obsessed with para-Normal.

01:28:16.684 --> 01:28:18.708
Other than that I see no other reason.

01:28:18.745 --> 01:28:20.057
Will they continue with the investigation?

01:28:20.829 --> 01:28:22.797
As far as I am concerned, this case is now closed.

01:28:24.785 --> 01:28:26.884
What led to the brilliant psychologist Leopold Judd ...

01:28:26.921 --> 01:28:32.675
... Specialist anorexia and chief clinical Ferriday ...

01:28:32.711 --> 01:28:34.330
... To commit these crimes?

01:28:35.830 --> 01:28:37.746
What they had in common victims?

01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:41.767
¿Shared secret that met ...

01:28:41.804 --> 01:28:43.224
... In this sad fate?

01:28:43.261 --> 01:28:45.831
These and more are the questions ...

01:28:45.867 --> 01:28:48.863
... To be made in our special report.

01:28:48.899 --> 01:28:53.081
But one thing is clear. The nightmare is over.

01:29:22.975 --> 01:29:24.568
Grace Hannigton, please.

01:29:27.804 --> 01:29:30.319
Grace, me, David.

01:29:32.201 --> 01:29:34.034
I need some recipes.

01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:37.281
Let's Grace.

01:29:39.376 --> 01:29:43.979
Please only two, please.

01:29:44.692 --> 01:29:50.975
All right.

01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:37.785
His back $ 19.

01:30:46.886 --> 01:30:49.741
-Be Thank you.

01:30:51.457 --> 01:30:55.322
Mike, come. This requirement is false.

01:30:55.489 --> 01:30:56.734
Hey boy.

01:31:01.996 --> 01:31:05.767
This requirement is false. Give it back.

01:31:05.804 --> 01:31:08.800
-Devuélvelo 'Go to hell.

01:31:29.229 --> 01:31:31.174
You deserve fucking junkie.

01:32:24.931 --> 01:32:29.461
Hey, did you see a girl going through a dark covered?

01:32:33.455 --> 01:32:39.497
You Sure? Come on, you can trust me.

01:33:02.296 --> 01:33:06.724
Sorry, sought another person.

01:33:06.903 --> 01:33:09.732
Someone wearing a bracelet.

01:35:40.867 --> 01:35:42.377
What a jerk.

01:35:49.946 --> 01:35:55.104
Aura, Aura.

01:36:01.872 --> 01:36:02.832
What thing is this?

01:36:51.273 --> 01:36:55.543
Did you think that was Aura? Was just me.

01:36:55.722 --> 01:36:57.209
You wanted to see Aura.

01:37:16.579 --> 01:37:24.124
Aura ... I knew you would see.

01:37:25.769 --> 01:37:27.854
Do not wanna see you do this.

01:37:28.076 --> 01:37:30.386
Where are we? -In My mom's house above.

01:37:34.387 --> 01:37:35.387
How did we get up?

01:37:36.922 --> 01:37:39.001
-is Alive? -Yup.

01:37:40.103 --> 01:37:42.800
God, where is it now?

01:37:42.859 --> 01:37:47.030
Side Up. Fast. Fast.

01:37:48.537 --> 01:37:49.836
No time.

01:38:00.324 --> 01:38:01.425
What are you doing?

01:38:02.483 --> 01:38:03.966
Chaining the door.

01:38:06.944 --> 01:38:08.378
In work.

01:38:08.830 --> 01:38:10.987
At least let's try fucking.

01:38:19.909 --> 01:38:21.350
¿David?

01:38:32.731 --> 01:38:36.931
I do not understand. I thought your mother was dead.

01:38:37.018 --> 01:38:38.818
La seen decapitated, ¿no?

01:38:38.854 --> 01:38:46.287
I saw a body. But it was not her. It was a neighbor.

01:38:48.133 --> 01:38:49.322
Oh my God.

01:38:49.938 --> 01:38:52.304
He faked his own death.

01:38:53.421 --> 01:38:59.556
I should have realized. He was ahead of me.

01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:03.862
In the dark it looked like someone had two heads.

01:39:03.898 --> 01:39:08.266
But it was only one, my father.

01:39:09.561 --> 01:39:12.147
He was sure that Judd had killed your mother.

01:39:12.545 --> 01:39:16.750
No, he never killed anyone.

01:39:17.808 --> 01:39:20.741
But he knew who the killer:

01:39:23.284 --> 01:39:24.238
My mom.

01:41:06.974 --> 01:41:12.092
Help! Somebody help us!

01:41:12.128 --> 01:41:14.885
Help us to leave the house!

01:41:17.097 --> 01:41:19.704
I can not believe your mother killed those people.

01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:20.693
Yes it did.

01:41:20.729 --> 01:41:24.000
Are you sure killed your father? -Yup!

01:41:25.295 --> 01:41:28.445
I because? I because?

01:41:31.947 --> 01:41:33.463
Here he comes.

01:41:42.451 --> 01:41:43.935
Take the chain.

01:41:46.527 --> 01:41:47.260
Do not do it.

01:41:48.394 --> 01:41:51.215
Do not let your mother outside.

01:41:54.156 --> 01:41:55.000
Never hurt you. You know that.

01:41:55.001 --> 01:41:56.800
I can not hear you.

01:41:58.341 --> 01:42:00.704
I will never hurt you.

01:42:02.567 --> 01:42:08.550
Open this door. Take the chain.

01:42:09.106 --> 01:42:19.201
Take it out! Take it out now!

01:42:31.229 --> 01:42:33.248
Why do you do this?

01:42:46.633 --> 01:42:49.798
After the others, I thought I would stop.

01:42:49.835 --> 01:42:53.730
-Please Please. -Why He killed?

01:42:53.766 --> 01:43:00.971
Porque... Nicholas... Nicholas.

01:43:05.919 --> 01:43:08.105
Push, push.

01:43:08.675 --> 01:43:11.115
We have problems. Scalpel. Scalpel.

01:43:26.669 --> 01:43:29.192
He beheaded the baby!

01:43:50.356 --> 01:43:54.701
Animals! Animals!

01:43:58.145 --> 01:44:00.073
Let Dr. Contrólese.

01:44:03.133 --> 01:44:08.750
Bastards! Bastards! Killer Beasts!

01:44:14.630 --> 01:44:16.594
Say yes.

01:44:20.053 --> 01:44:26.757
Murderer! Miserable! Farsante!

01:44:39.895 --> 01:44:42.817
They believed they could make me forget everything.

01:44:44.431 --> 01:44:45.969
But Nicholas ...

01:44:47.164 --> 01:44:51.814
... He asked me to die their murderers.

01:44:52.151 --> 01:44:54.610
So I obeyed.

01:44:55.283 --> 01:44:56.744
Now you know my secret!

01:44:57.864 --> 01:45:00.688
Do Not! I beg you!

01:45:44.650 --> 01:45:47.124
Ms. Petrescu. I want to ask some questions.

01:45:53.596 --> 01:45:55.655
Get these damn reporters here.

01:45:59.986 --> 01:46:04.203
Did you know Dr. Judd? Can you tell me something about it?

01:46:05.378 --> 01:46:06.904
Does Dr. Judd?

01:46:07.462 --> 01:46:09.323
Dr. Judd.

01:46:15.456 --> 01:46:17.235
Did you work with your mother?

01:46:19.199 --> 01:46:20.286
Worked.

01:46:23.345 --> 01:46:25.153
Were they lovers?

01:46:25.164 --> 01:46:26.945
Lovers.

01:46:32.278 --> 01:46:34.461
Your mother committed the crimes?

01:46:34.461 --> 01:46:35.808
He committed the crimes.

01:46:36.457 --> 01:46:38.728
Your mother committed the crimes?

01:46:40.775 --> 01:46:42.474
Eh, what happens?

01:46:42.613 --> 01:46:44.288
Déjenlo.

01:46:46.924 --> 01:46:49.340
Aura, is over.

01:46:50.478 --> 01:46:53.895
Me, David. It's over.

01:47:08.721 --> 01:47:10.728
I never gonna hurt.

01:47:12.594 --> 01:47:14.527
I looked everywhere.

01:47:16.119 --> 01:47:17.606
I love you.
