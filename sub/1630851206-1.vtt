WEBVTT

00:55.255 --> 00:57.557
My planet
Arrakis is so beautiful

00:57.624 --> 00:59.192
when the sun is low.

01:02.562 --> 01:05.098
Rolling over the sands...

01:05.198 --> 01:08.101
you can see spice in the air.

01:20.380 --> 01:24.417
At nightfall,
the spice harvesters land.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.054
The outsiders
race against time

01:28.121 --> 01:30.457
to avoid the heat of the day.

01:39.332 --> 01:43.236
They ravage our lands
in front of our eyes.

01:43.303 --> 01:47.240
Their cruelty to my people
is all I've known.

01:51.911 --> 01:54.347
These outsiders,
the Harkonnens,

01:54.447 --> 01:56.449
came long before I was born.

01:56.516 --> 01:58.451
By controlling
spice production,

01:58.518 --> 02:00.353
they became obscenely rich.

02:00.453 --> 02:03.156
Richer than
the Emperor himself.

02:20.607 --> 02:22.342
-

02:44.831 --> 02:48.334
Our warriors couldn't free
Arrakis from the Harkonnens,

02:48.401 --> 02:49.636
but one day,

02:49.702 --> 02:53.039
by Imperial decree,
they were gone.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.315
Why did the Emperor
choose this path?

03:03.583 --> 03:06.085
And who will
our next oppressors be?

03:57.370 --> 03:59.105
It's good you're up early.

04:00.473 --> 04:01.808
Your father wants you
in full dress

04:01.908 --> 04:03.610
before the Emperor's Herald
arrives.

04:04.277 --> 04:05.778
Full dress?

04:06.713 --> 04:08.381
Military?

04:08.448 --> 04:10.984
-Ceremonial.
-

04:11.084 --> 04:12.318
Why do we have to go
through all this

04:12.418 --> 04:13.920
when it's already
been decided?

04:14.988 --> 04:16.389
Ceremony.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.091
Mm.

04:18.958 --> 04:19.993
Thank you.

04:21.461 --> 04:23.830
If you want it,
make me give it to you.

04:25.231 --> 04:26.132
Use the Voice.

04:26.232 --> 04:28.067
Mom, I just woke up.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.311
Give me the water.

04:38.411 --> 04:40.680
The glass can't hear you.
Command me.

05:07.874 --> 05:10.143
Give me the water.

05:22.622 --> 05:23.623
Almost.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.058
Almost?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.560
Bene Gesserit skills
take years to learn, Paul.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.530
Mm-hmm.
-You look tired.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.732
More dreams?

05:38.338 --> 05:39.405
No.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.010
Extreme temperatures

05:44.077 --> 05:45.745
and treacherous weather events

05:45.845 --> 05:49.582
make life outside the cities
of Arrakis truly hostile,

05:49.682 --> 05:51.551
with sandstorms
powerful enough

05:51.651 --> 05:53.252
to cut through metal.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.055
Only the native tribes
known as the Fremen

05:56.155 --> 05:59.726
have adapted
well enough to survive.

05:59.826 --> 06:04.263
Preferring to inhabit the
remotest regions of Arrakis,

06:04.364 --> 06:06.265
the Fremen share
the deep desert

06:06.366 --> 06:07.934
with the giant sandworms

06:08.034 --> 06:11.437
known to the Fremen
as  Shai-Hulud.

06:11.537 --> 06:14.107
Long exposure to spice
has given the tribe

06:14.207 --> 06:16.876
their characteristic
blue eyes,

06:16.943 --> 06:18.911
the Eyes of Ibad.

06:19.011 --> 06:22.014
Little else is known
of the Fremen,

06:22.081 --> 06:26.119
except that they are
dangerous and unreliable.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.921
Fremen attacks
make spice harvesting

06:29.021 --> 06:30.890
extremely hazardous.

06:30.957 --> 06:34.627
For the Fremen, spice
is the sacred hallucinogen

06:34.727 --> 06:36.062
which preserves life

06:36.129 --> 06:38.931
and brings
enormous health benefits.

06:39.031 --> 06:40.633
For the Imperium,

06:40.733 --> 06:42.869
spice is used
by the navigators

06:42.935 --> 06:44.637
of the Spacing Guild

06:44.737 --> 06:47.607
to find safe paths
between the stars.

06:47.707 --> 06:48.908
Without spice,

06:48.975 --> 06:51.978
interstellar travel
is impossible,

06:52.078 --> 06:53.546
making it by far

06:53.613 --> 06:56.816
the most valuable substance
in the universe.

07:46.265 --> 07:47.300
Smile, Gurney.

07:48.434 --> 07:50.470
I am smiling.

07:51.437 --> 07:53.039
How much will it cost them,

07:53.139 --> 07:55.641
traveling all this way
for this formality?

07:55.708 --> 07:57.043
Three Guild Navigators.

07:57.143 --> 08:00.813
A total of 1.46 million,
62 solaris, round trip.

08:16.529 --> 08:19.799
By the grace of
Shaddam IV of House Corrino,

08:19.866 --> 08:21.834
ascendant to
the Golden Lion Throne

08:21.901 --> 08:24.737
of Padishah Emperor
of the Known Universe,

08:24.837 --> 08:29.075
I stand before you
as Herald of the Change.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.078
We are witnessed by members
of the Imperial Court,

08:32.178 --> 08:34.680
representatives
of the Spacing Guild

08:34.747 --> 08:38.050
and a sister
of the Bene Gesserit.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.821
The Emperor has spoken.

08:43.256 --> 08:46.058
"House Atreides
shall immediately

08:46.158 --> 08:47.894
take control of Arrakis

08:47.994 --> 08:51.163
and serve as its steward."

08:52.865 --> 08:54.767
Do you accept?

09:03.943 --> 09:06.846
We are House Atreides.

09:06.913 --> 09:08.848
There is no call
we do not answer,

09:08.915 --> 09:11.250
there is no faith
that we betray.

09:11.350 --> 09:16.355
The Emperor asks us
to bring peace to Arrakis.

09:16.422 --> 09:18.858
House Atreides accepts.

09:18.925 --> 09:23.296
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

09:23.396 --> 09:27.867
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

09:34.907 --> 09:36.475
Your seal.

10:12.244 --> 10:13.512
So, it's done?

10:15.147 --> 10:16.616
It's done.

10:43.275 --> 10:44.677
How was it?

10:44.777 --> 10:46.178
Stabilizers are too loose.

10:46.278 --> 10:48.347
-We'll dial it in.
-Thank you, my friend.

10:48.447 --> 10:49.515
Got it.

10:50.182 --> 10:51.217
Duncan.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.385
My boy.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.886
-Hey. Hey.

10:53.986 --> 10:55.521
Paul, my boy.

10:57.223 --> 10:59.692
So, you're going
to Arrakis tomorrow.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.227
With the advance team.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.795
Yes, I'm going
to Arrakis tomorrow

11:02.862 --> 11:04.130
with the advance team.

11:05.297 --> 11:07.066
I'd like you
to take me with you.

11:07.700 --> 11:08.701
You would?

11:09.902 --> 11:11.637
Well, that's too bad.
'Cause no.

11:12.905 --> 11:14.140
Duncan.

11:14.206 --> 11:16.475
Are you trying
to get me court-martialed?

11:17.543 --> 11:18.644
What's going on?

11:18.711 --> 11:20.146
Can I trust you
with something?

11:20.212 --> 11:21.480
Always. You know that.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.855
I've been having dreams.

11:32.191 --> 11:34.927
About Arrakis and the Fremen.

11:43.202 --> 11:44.937
Okay.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.238
So?

11:47.707 --> 11:48.874
I saw you.

11:52.211 --> 11:54.280
With the Fremen.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.115
Ah.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.616
So, I do find them.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.052
There you go. That's a good
omen right there, right?

12:02.621 --> 12:03.622
Lanville!

12:10.062 --> 12:11.931
I saw you lying dead.

12:12.865 --> 12:14.633
Fallen in battle.

12:15.935 --> 12:18.270
It felt like
if I had been there,

12:18.370 --> 12:20.139
you'd be alive.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.612
First off, I'm not gonna die.

12:26.712 --> 12:27.880
You're not
taking me seriously.

12:27.947 --> 12:29.982
That's why
you want to come with me.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.417
Listen.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.152
Dreams make good stories,

12:33.252 --> 12:35.654
but everything important
happens when we're awake.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.823
'Cause that's when
we make things happen.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.259
Look at you.
Put on some muscle?

12:40.326 --> 12:41.560
I did?

12:41.627 --> 12:42.895
No.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.066
Hey.

12:47.133 --> 12:49.301
See you on Arrakis, my boy.

13:24.637 --> 13:26.705
Father, I'd like to ask
to join Duncan Idaho

13:26.806 --> 13:29.542
on his scout mission
to Arrakis tomorrow.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.544
I've studied the Fremen
language, I'd be an asset.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.878
Out of the question.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.280
You'll travel
in a few weeks to Arrakis,

13:34.346 --> 13:35.481
like the rest of us.

13:35.548 --> 13:36.849
I've been training
my whole life.

13:36.949 --> 13:38.184
What is the point

13:38.284 --> 13:39.552
if I'm not allowed
to face some actual risk?

13:39.652 --> 13:40.886
You know why, Paul.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.055
You're the future
of House Atreides.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.558
And Grandfather
fought bulls for sport!

13:45.658 --> 13:47.359
Yes.

13:47.459 --> 13:49.061
And look where that got him.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.734
I need you by my side.

13:55.835 --> 13:58.871
When we get to Arrakis,
we'll face enormous danger.

13:58.971 --> 14:00.506
What danger?

14:00.573 --> 14:02.474
The Fremen? The desert?

14:02.541 --> 14:04.510
Political danger.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.648
The Great Houses
look to us for leadership,

14:09.715 --> 14:11.750
and this threatens
the Emperor.

14:11.851 --> 14:15.087
By taking Arrakis from the
Harkonnens and making it ours,

14:15.187 --> 14:17.256
he sets the stage for a war

14:17.356 --> 14:19.491
which would weaken
both houses.

14:21.026 --> 14:22.761
But if we hold firm,

14:22.862 --> 14:24.930
and tap the true power
of Arrakis,

14:25.030 --> 14:27.333
we could be stronger
than ever.

14:27.399 --> 14:29.034
What does that mean?

14:29.101 --> 14:30.236
Mining spice,

14:30.336 --> 14:31.837
keeping the Fremen
in their place?

14:31.904 --> 14:33.105
We'd be no better
than Harkonnens.

14:33.205 --> 14:34.607
No.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.843
By making an alliance
with the Fremen.

14:37.910 --> 14:40.613
That's what I've sent
Duncan Idaho to arrange.

14:42.081 --> 14:43.215
Here on Caladan,

14:43.282 --> 14:45.784
we've ruled by air power
and sea power.

14:45.885 --> 14:49.722
On Arrakis, we need
to cultivate desert power.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.760
I want you sitting in
on my Council.

14:54.860 --> 14:56.228
Learn what I do.

14:56.295 --> 14:58.063
What if I'm not, Dad?

14:59.698 --> 15:01.100
Not what?

15:02.568 --> 15:05.137
The future of House Atreides.

15:17.416 --> 15:19.952
I told my father
I didn't want this either.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.758
I wanted to be a pilot.

15:27.092 --> 15:28.394
You never told me that.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.499
Your grandfather said,

15:33.599 --> 15:36.335
"A great man
doesn't seek to lead.

15:36.435 --> 15:40.072
He's called to it,
and he answers."

15:41.740 --> 15:43.642
And if your answer is no...

15:46.745 --> 15:49.949
you'll still be the only thing
I ever needed you to be...

15:51.784 --> 15:53.018
my son.

16:03.162 --> 16:07.132
I found my own way to it.
Maybe you'll find yours.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.471
In their memory...

16:15.007 --> 16:16.809
give it a try.

16:25.617 --> 16:27.820
Don't stand
with your back to the door.

16:29.021 --> 16:30.556
How many times
do we have to tell you?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.057
I could tell it was you

16:32.157 --> 16:33.892
by your footsteps,
Gurney Halleck.

16:33.993 --> 16:36.729
Someone
might imitate my stride.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.063
I know the difference.

16:38.163 --> 16:39.732
Are you the new
Weapons Master?

16:39.832 --> 16:43.569
With Duncan Idaho gone,
I must make do as best I can.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.071
Choose your blade.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.906
I've had quite a day, Gurney.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.042
Give us a song instead.

16:54.646 --> 16:55.714
That's rude.

17:13.232 --> 17:14.767
Come on.

17:14.867 --> 17:15.868
Come on.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.169
Old man.

17:28.847 --> 17:31.383
Ah, the slow blade
penetrates the shield.

17:38.457 --> 17:40.292
I guess I'm not
in the mood today.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.593
-Mood?
-Yeah.

17:41.693 --> 17:42.795
What's mood to do with it?

17:42.895 --> 17:44.630
You fight
when the necessity arises,

17:44.730 --> 17:45.731
no matter the mood.

17:45.798 --> 17:46.899
Now fight!

17:52.404 --> 17:53.405
Come on!

18:05.084 --> 18:07.453
-I have you.

18:07.553 --> 18:09.254
Aye.

18:09.321 --> 18:10.989
But look down, my lord.

18:11.090 --> 18:13.659
You'd have joined me in death.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.627
I see you found the mood.

18:27.840 --> 18:29.441
Will it be that bad?

18:29.508 --> 18:32.010
You don't get it, do you?

18:32.111 --> 18:33.345
You don't really understand

18:33.445 --> 18:36.115
the grave nature
of what's happening to us.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.018
For 80 years,

18:40.119 --> 18:42.254
Arrakis belonged
to House Harkonnen.

18:42.321 --> 18:44.823
80 years of owning
the spice fields.

18:44.923 --> 18:47.025
Can you imagine the wealth?

18:47.126 --> 18:49.027
Your eyes.
I need to see it in your eyes.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.630
You never met
Harkonnens before, I have.

18:51.697 --> 18:54.766
They're not human,
they're brutal!

18:54.833 --> 18:56.768
You have to be ready.

19:38.677 --> 19:39.878
Lord Baron.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.082
Rabban.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.852
The last of our ships
have left Arrakis.

19:47.719 --> 19:49.221
It's done.

19:49.321 --> 19:50.822
Very good.

19:53.825 --> 19:55.894
Uncle, how can we
let this happen?

19:55.994 --> 19:58.030
How can the Emperor

19:58.096 --> 20:00.666
take everything we've built

20:00.732 --> 20:03.035
and give it to that Duke?

20:03.101 --> 20:04.403
How?

20:04.503 --> 20:07.406
Don't be too sure
it's an act of love.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.276
What does he mean?

20:16.882 --> 20:19.718
When is a gift not a gift?

20:21.453 --> 20:25.023
The Atreides' voice is rising,

20:25.090 --> 20:28.393
and the Emperor
is a jealous man.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.632
A dangerous, jealous man.

21:45.304 --> 21:46.338
Paul.

21:47.839 --> 21:49.541
Paul, wake up.

21:55.347 --> 21:56.381
What's wrong?

21:56.481 --> 21:58.784
Get dressed and come with me.

22:19.204 --> 22:20.572
What is this?

22:20.672 --> 22:23.575
The Reverend Mother
Gaius Helen Mohiam is here.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.811
She was my teacher
at the Bene Gesserit school.

22:25.877 --> 22:29.414
She's now Truthsayer
to the Emperor himself.

22:29.514 --> 22:31.383
She would like to meet you.

22:31.983 --> 22:33.585
Why?

22:33.685 --> 22:36.021
She wants to know
about your dreams.

22:37.389 --> 22:39.224
How does she know
about my dreams?

22:41.893 --> 22:43.428
And why is Dr. Yueh here?

22:43.528 --> 22:45.897
He only needs a moment.

22:45.997 --> 22:47.999
Hello, young master.

22:48.066 --> 22:50.769
Your mother asked me
to check your vitals.

22:56.742 --> 22:58.076
What's happening?

23:19.564 --> 23:22.434
His heart
is strong as ever, my lady.

23:36.548 --> 23:37.649
Paul...

24:05.777 --> 24:11.283
Who are you?

24:15.654 --> 24:17.923
Defiance in the eyes.

24:17.989 --> 24:19.658
Like his father.

24:19.758 --> 24:21.326
Leave us.

24:21.426 --> 24:22.427
You must do everything

24:22.494 --> 24:23.862
the Reverend Mother tells you.

24:27.499 --> 24:28.834
You dismiss my mother
in her own house.

24:28.934 --> 24:30.101
Come here.

24:30.769 --> 24:31.770
Kneel.

24:35.874 --> 24:37.809
How dare you use
the Voice on me?

24:45.150 --> 24:46.451
Put
your right hand in the box.

24:48.620 --> 24:51.022
Your mother bade you obey me.

24:59.130 --> 25:01.566
I hold at your neck
the Gom Jabbar.

25:02.634 --> 25:04.302
A poison needle.

25:04.369 --> 25:05.670
Instant death.

25:06.705 --> 25:08.240
The test is simple.

25:08.340 --> 25:10.876
Remove your hand from the box

25:10.976 --> 25:12.544
and you die.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.247
What's in the box?

25:16.515 --> 25:17.582
Pain.

25:19.184 --> 25:22.387
-No need to call the guards.

25:22.487 --> 25:24.089
Your mother stands
behind that door.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.891
No one would get past her.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.366
Why are you doing this?

25:36.101 --> 25:37.435
An animal caught in a trap

25:37.536 --> 25:40.338
will gnaw off
its own leg to escape.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.340
What will you do?

26:14.239 --> 26:16.374
-Silence.

26:23.315 --> 26:25.116
-

26:25.216 --> 26:27.052
I must not fear.

26:28.787 --> 26:30.388
I must not fear.

26:36.795 --> 26:38.663
Fear is the mind-killer.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.000
Fear

26:42.100 --> 26:44.469
is the little death
that brings obliteration.

26:44.569 --> 26:47.172
-

26:47.272 --> 26:49.007
And I'll face my fear
and I'll permit it

26:49.107 --> 26:50.241
to pass over me
and through me.

27:05.624 --> 27:06.958
And when it has gone past...

27:15.634 --> 27:18.503
I will turn the inner eye
and see its path.

27:21.539 --> 27:24.275
And where the fear
has gone,

27:25.110 --> 27:26.144
there will be nothing.

27:31.149 --> 27:32.651
Only I will remain.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.189
Enough.

27:38.289 --> 27:40.492
-

27:54.806 --> 27:57.409
Like sifting sand
through a screen,

27:57.509 --> 28:00.078
we sift people.

28:00.178 --> 28:03.048
If you had been unable
to control your impulses,

28:03.148 --> 28:04.716
like an animal,

28:04.816 --> 28:07.018
we could not let you live.

28:07.085 --> 28:09.754
You inherit too much power.

28:09.854 --> 28:10.989
What, because
I'm a duke's son?

28:11.056 --> 28:13.858
Because you are Jessica's son.

28:13.925 --> 28:16.561
You have more
than one birthright, boy.

28:18.196 --> 28:19.230
Jessica?

28:26.271 --> 28:28.606
You've been training him
in the Way.

28:33.044 --> 28:35.714
Tell me about these dreams.

28:35.780 --> 28:37.916
-I had one tonight.
-What did you see?

28:40.852 --> 28:42.220
A girl.

28:42.287 --> 28:43.955
On Arrakis.

28:44.055 --> 28:45.423
Have you dreamt of her before?

28:49.561 --> 28:50.862
Many times.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.600
Do you often dream
things that happen

28:55.700 --> 28:56.868
just as you dreamed them?

29:00.271 --> 29:01.573
Not exactly.

29:05.210 --> 29:06.811
Goodbye, young human.

29:07.612 --> 29:09.247
I hope you live.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.157
Did you have to go that far?

29:19.257 --> 29:20.992
You chose
to train him in the Way,

29:21.092 --> 29:22.994
in defiance of our rule.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.629
He wields our power.

29:24.729 --> 29:27.499
He had to be
tested to the limits.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.835
So much potential,
wasted in a male.

29:30.935 --> 29:32.904
You were told
to bear only daughters.

29:32.971 --> 29:34.339
But you, in your pride,

29:34.439 --> 29:36.341
thought you could
produce the  Kwisatz Haderach.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.842
Was I wrong?

29:37.942 --> 29:40.678
You're lucky he didn't die
in that room.

29:40.779 --> 29:43.014
If he is The One,
he has a long way to go.

29:43.114 --> 29:46.151
His Sight is barely awakened,
and now he goes into the fire.

29:47.619 --> 29:50.088
But our plans
are measured in centuries.

29:50.155 --> 29:51.689
We have other prospects

29:51.790 --> 29:54.159
if he fails his promise.

29:56.761 --> 29:59.264
Do you see so little hope?

29:59.330 --> 30:00.698
On Arrakis,
we have done

30:00.799 --> 30:02.433
all we can for you.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.335
A path has been laid.

30:04.435 --> 30:06.671
Let's hope
he doesn't squander it.

30:53.918 --> 30:55.253
Paul.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.722
What does it mean?

30:59.090 --> 31:00.758
That I could be The One?

31:00.859 --> 31:02.193
You heard.

31:05.563 --> 31:06.831
The Bene Gesserit serve

31:06.898 --> 31:09.400
as powerful partners
to the Great Houses,

31:10.435 --> 31:11.703
but there's more to it.

31:11.769 --> 31:14.339
You steer the politics
of the Imperium

31:14.405 --> 31:15.840
from the shadows.

31:16.541 --> 31:17.542
I know.

31:17.609 --> 31:20.078
You don't know everything.

31:20.178 --> 31:22.447
For thousands of years,

31:22.547 --> 31:25.183
we've been carefully
crossings bloodlines

31:25.250 --> 31:27.385
-to bring forth...
-The One?

31:28.553 --> 31:30.021
A mind...

31:31.756 --> 31:36.094
powerful enough
to bridge space and time.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.730
Past and future.

31:40.732 --> 31:43.034
Who can help us
into a better future.

31:44.235 --> 31:46.905
We think he's very close now.

31:48.873 --> 31:51.042
Some believe he's here.

31:55.046 --> 31:57.048
All part of a plan.

34:15.186 --> 34:16.187
Shield.

34:58.629 --> 35:00.498
"My lungs taste
the air of Time,

35:00.598 --> 35:02.600
Blown past falling sand..."

35:47.278 --> 35:48.379
Thufir Hawat.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.352
Young master!

35:54.452 --> 35:56.721
How does it feel
to walk on a new world?

35:56.821 --> 35:58.723
Exciting, to say the least.

35:59.457 --> 36:01.292
My lord.

36:01.359 --> 36:02.994
How are you, old friend?

36:03.060 --> 36:05.396
My advance team
has secured the city.

36:05.496 --> 36:08.499
We're still smoothing out
a few rough spots.

36:10.134 --> 36:11.469
My lady.

36:15.907 --> 36:17.875
Lisan al-Gaib!

36:33.658 --> 36:36.661
Lisan al-Gaib!
Lisan al-Gaib!

36:37.728 --> 36:39.730
Lisan al-Gaib!

36:39.830 --> 36:42.066
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

36:42.166 --> 36:45.102
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

36:45.203 --> 36:48.105
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

36:48.206 --> 36:51.209
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

36:52.910 --> 36:54.679
Don't be fooled
by the welcome.

36:54.745 --> 36:56.614
They follow
their old masters' rules.

36:56.714 --> 36:57.848
Mandatory attendance.

36:57.915 --> 37:00.218
That's Harkonnen love
out there.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.292
Atreides!

37:08.392 --> 37:11.963
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

37:12.063 --> 37:15.800
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

37:15.900 --> 37:18.369
Atreides! Atreides!

37:20.471 --> 37:23.241
Let's get you
out of the sun.

37:23.307 --> 37:25.810
The heat can kill
in this place.

37:42.059 --> 37:43.794
They were pointing at us.

37:44.795 --> 37:46.130
What are they shouting?

37:46.230 --> 37:50.134
Lisan al-Gaib.
"Voice from the Outer World."

37:50.234 --> 37:52.937
It's their name for "messiah."

37:53.004 --> 37:56.307
It means the Bene Gesserit
have been at work here.

37:56.407 --> 37:58.843
Planting superstitions.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.746
Preparing the way, Paul.

38:01.812 --> 38:04.148
These people
have waited for centuries

38:04.248 --> 38:05.983
for the  Lisan al-Gaib.

38:06.684 --> 38:07.785
They see you,

38:08.619 --> 38:10.521
they see the signs.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.593
They see
what they've been told to see.

38:20.665 --> 38:21.699
We're good to go.

39:05.209 --> 39:06.544
Shield Wall.

39:06.644 --> 39:08.512
Protects the city
from the weather

39:08.579 --> 39:10.081
and the worms.

39:56.927 --> 39:59.764
The locals call
the big one the Hand of God.

40:01.565 --> 40:04.135
Well, the Hand of God
is wreaking havoc

40:04.235 --> 40:05.770
on our comms system.

40:08.973 --> 40:10.441
It's so quiet.

40:11.475 --> 40:13.544
Yeah.

40:13.611 --> 40:15.479
That's what worries me, too.

40:22.253 --> 40:23.988
There's the spaceport

40:24.088 --> 40:26.724
and that plume of dust there
is the spice refinery.

40:26.791 --> 40:28.893
Our two
most vulnerable points.

40:28.959 --> 40:30.261
I want you guarding them.

40:30.327 --> 40:32.963
If we can't refine spice
and ship it off-world,

40:33.063 --> 40:35.099
-we're dead here.
- My lord.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.802
The sun's getting too high.
We need to seal the doors.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.675
What do they say
about this hellhole again?

40:44.775 --> 40:47.244
"To shower, you scrub your ass
with sand," my lord.

40:47.311 --> 40:48.846
That's what they say.

40:48.946 --> 40:50.581
That's what they say.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.822
Candidates
for a housekeeper, my lady.

41:13.604 --> 41:15.105
What is your name?

41:15.172 --> 41:17.341
Shadout Mapes, my lady.

41:19.109 --> 41:21.178
The rest of you may go.

41:21.278 --> 41:22.379
Thank you.

41:24.682 --> 41:26.650
Shadout.

41:26.717 --> 41:28.519
It's an old Chakobsa word.

41:29.286 --> 41:30.721
"Well-dipper."

41:33.691 --> 41:34.892
You know the ancient tongues?

41:34.992 --> 41:36.460
I know many things.

41:36.527 --> 41:39.697
I know that you have a weapon
concealed in your bodice.

41:41.899 --> 41:43.467
If you mean to harm me,

41:43.534 --> 41:46.036
I must warn you,
whatever you're hiding,

41:46.871 --> 41:48.639
it won't be enough.

41:50.374 --> 41:52.877
The weapon is meant as a gift

41:53.811 --> 41:56.013
if you are truly The One.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.430
Do you know this?

42:14.765 --> 42:16.400
It's a crysknife.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.605
Do you know its meaning?

42:25.843 --> 42:27.444
It's a maker...

42:32.550 --> 42:35.019
A maker of the deep desert.

42:37.555 --> 42:39.957
When you have lived
with prophecy for so long,

42:40.057 --> 42:42.626
the moment of revelation
is a shock.

42:42.726 --> 42:44.395
Lisan al-Gaib.

42:44.461 --> 42:46.597
The mother and the son.

42:52.536 --> 42:54.271
It is yours.

42:55.873 --> 42:59.476
Tooth of  Shai-Hulud.

43:29.607 --> 43:32.409
Lisan! Lisan al-Gaib!

43:32.476 --> 43:36.614
Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!

43:46.957 --> 43:48.158
Hello.

43:50.527 --> 43:53.263
You shouldn't be out here
at this hour of the day.

43:55.432 --> 43:57.668
They're out here.

43:57.768 --> 44:00.371
Hmm.
Fremen pilgrims.

44:00.471 --> 44:02.439
They don't care
about heatstroke.

44:04.141 --> 44:07.378
I didn't know date palms
could even be found out here.

44:07.478 --> 44:10.614
Oh,
these aren't indigenous.

44:10.681 --> 44:13.150
They can't survive without me.

44:13.217 --> 44:14.451
Each one of these

44:14.518 --> 44:17.121
drinks every day
the equivalent of five men.

44:19.223 --> 44:20.891
Twenty palm trees.

44:22.192 --> 44:24.728
A hundred lives.

44:24.828 --> 44:26.864
Should we remove them?
Save the water?

44:26.964 --> 44:28.365
No, no, no.

44:28.465 --> 44:30.034
These are sacred.

44:34.405 --> 44:35.873
Old dream.

44:43.747 --> 44:45.916
The largest and most dangerous

44:46.016 --> 44:48.986
organism on Arrakis
is the sandworm,

44:49.053 --> 44:53.190
capable of reaching
400 meters in length.

44:53.257 --> 44:55.659
To avoid making
rhythmic noises,

44:55.726 --> 44:57.227
which attract the sandworms,

44:57.327 --> 45:01.265
the Fremen cross desert spaces
using the sandwalk,

45:01.365 --> 45:04.368
a dance-like motion
with irregular rhythm

45:04.435 --> 45:08.439
which emulates the natural
sounds of the desert.

45:08.539 --> 45:11.175
What scant plant life
exists on Arrakis

45:11.241 --> 45:12.843
is thanks to the Fremen,

45:12.910 --> 45:15.846
who have cultivated
deep-rooted terranic plants

45:15.913 --> 45:18.949
such as saguaro, burrobush,

45:19.049 --> 45:23.120
sand-verbena and incense bush.

45:23.220 --> 45:26.457
The shepherd's tree has
the deepest documented roots,

45:26.557 --> 45:31.061
stretching more than
450 feet deep.

45:31.128 --> 45:33.030
These plants cling to life

45:33.097 --> 45:36.400
in a parched,
nutrient-poor landscape.

46:46.537 --> 46:48.272
It's a hunter-seeker.

46:48.338 --> 46:50.374
The operator must be nearby.

46:55.445 --> 46:56.880
The Harkonnen agent
was cemented

46:56.980 --> 46:58.849
into that hole six weeks ago.

46:58.949 --> 47:00.651
Ran the hunter-seeker
through a water pipe

47:00.717 --> 47:01.819
inside the walls.

47:03.120 --> 47:06.190
Sire, I failed you today.
There's no excuse.

47:06.290 --> 47:07.691
You have my resignation.

47:07.791 --> 47:09.059
You would deprive us
of your talents at this time?

47:09.159 --> 47:10.360
Sire, my honor demands...

47:10.460 --> 47:12.162
They tried to take
the life of my son!

47:13.330 --> 47:14.798
I don't give a damn
about your honor.

47:14.865 --> 47:17.467
You want absolution?
Go catch some spies.

47:17.534 --> 47:18.735
Your Grace.

47:26.043 --> 47:28.312
The thing must leave.

47:28.378 --> 47:30.881
You can speak
without fear.

47:30.981 --> 47:33.250
Our pet doesn't understand
your language.

47:33.350 --> 47:34.818
Get out.

47:39.189 --> 47:40.991
It understands.

47:41.058 --> 47:42.593
Activate silence.

47:58.008 --> 48:00.510
It must
never be known.

48:00.577 --> 48:03.513
There's
no satellites over Arrakis.

48:03.580 --> 48:07.217
The Atreides
will die in the dark.

48:07.284 --> 48:08.952
On that matter,

48:09.052 --> 48:12.222
Duke Leto Atreides
means nothing to our order.

48:12.289 --> 48:14.258
But his wife
is under our protection

48:14.358 --> 48:16.960
and by extension, her son.

48:17.060 --> 48:19.563
Allow them
the dignity of exile.

48:23.734 --> 48:25.636
House Harkonnen
would never dream

48:25.736 --> 48:28.705
of violating
the sanctity of your order.

48:29.740 --> 48:31.408
I give you my word.

48:31.475 --> 48:33.143
We will not harm them.

48:53.397 --> 48:54.932
If the Duke's son lives...

48:54.998 --> 48:57.501
No Atreides will live.

48:57.601 --> 49:00.003
My lord, you gave your word
to the witch.

49:00.103 --> 49:01.171
She sees too much.

49:01.271 --> 49:03.006
I said I would not harm them.

49:03.106 --> 49:04.341
And I shall not.

49:04.441 --> 49:06.743
But Arrakis is Arrakis.

49:07.945 --> 49:10.514
And the desert takes the weak.

49:12.616 --> 49:13.850
My desert.

49:16.687 --> 49:18.655
My Arrakis.

49:20.590 --> 49:22.259
My Dune.

49:25.462 --> 49:27.798
Your first
strategy meeting.

49:27.864 --> 49:29.099
Paul Atreides,

49:29.166 --> 49:31.101
who catches hunter-seekers
in his bare hands

49:31.168 --> 49:32.302
like a hero of old.

49:34.705 --> 49:36.873
Thanks
for the humiliation, old man.

49:36.974 --> 49:38.275
Gotta keep an eye on you.

49:39.142 --> 49:40.444
Attention!

49:48.452 --> 49:49.820
Let's get started.

49:52.222 --> 49:54.057
Thufir. Operations.

49:54.157 --> 49:56.827
I secured a copy of
the Harkonnens' account books.

49:59.296 --> 50:00.564
The Harkonnens were taking

50:00.664 --> 50:04.134
10 billion solaris
out of here every year.

50:04.201 --> 50:06.870
"They shall suck of
the abundance of the seas,

50:06.970 --> 50:08.472
and the treasure
hid in the sand."

50:08.538 --> 50:10.907
We won't see profits
like that for a while.

50:11.008 --> 50:13.176
Not with the equipment
they left us.

50:14.144 --> 50:15.746
How bad is it?

50:21.485 --> 50:23.487
These are spice silos.

50:24.855 --> 50:27.924
We're meant
to fill every crate.

50:28.025 --> 50:29.926
All of them?

50:30.027 --> 50:32.863
Every 25 standard days.

50:32.929 --> 50:35.265
Harkonnen sabotage
slows us down.

50:35.365 --> 50:37.067
But who's
meant to arbitrate?

50:37.167 --> 50:38.368
Isn't there
a Judge of the Change

50:38.435 --> 50:39.736
to oversee the transition?

50:39.836 --> 50:41.238
Who did the Emperor appoint?

50:41.338 --> 50:44.107
Dr. Liet Kynes.
Imperial Ecologist.

50:44.207 --> 50:45.709
Been here 20 years.

50:45.776 --> 50:47.611
Eccentric, from what I'm told.

50:47.711 --> 50:50.747
I want to see these
harvesting fields myself.

50:50.847 --> 50:52.215
I wouldn't recommend it,
my lord.

50:52.282 --> 50:54.751
Have this Judge of the Change
accompany us.

50:54.851 --> 50:56.286
A meeting's long overdue.

50:56.386 --> 50:58.588
And we'll get
a bit of Imperial protection.

51:00.257 --> 51:01.558
I love it.

51:01.625 --> 51:02.726
Hmm.

51:02.793 --> 51:05.062
-He's here, my lord.

51:28.985 --> 51:30.954
Take care
of them. They are friends.

51:31.054 --> 51:31.988
Duncan!

51:32.089 --> 51:33.457
Ah! My boy!

51:39.262 --> 51:40.430
I swear you're getting taller.

51:40.497 --> 51:42.165
Well,
you smell much worse.

51:45.902 --> 51:47.838
For four weeks,
I lived with the Fremen.

51:47.938 --> 51:49.005
Hidden in the desert,

51:49.106 --> 51:50.807
in a community
called a  sietch.

51:50.907 --> 51:52.175
Stilgar, the leader
of that  sietch,

51:52.275 --> 51:54.077
has come with me
to meet you, sire.

51:54.144 --> 51:56.480
This  sietch,  how is it hidden?

51:56.580 --> 51:57.647
It's underground.

51:57.747 --> 51:59.683
Arrakis is filled
with caverns.

51:59.783 --> 52:01.451
How big was the place?

52:01.518 --> 52:03.987
I'd say 10,000 people.

52:04.087 --> 52:05.622
And there are
hundreds of  sietches.

52:06.823 --> 52:08.258
Millions of Fremen.

52:09.025 --> 52:10.494
You were right.

52:10.594 --> 52:13.930
The Harkonnen estimate was
50,000 on the whole planet.

52:13.997 --> 52:16.199
The Fremen watched me
search for them for days.

52:16.299 --> 52:17.767
I never saw them.

52:17.834 --> 52:20.537
Finally, they sent
a warrior out to kill me.

52:20.637 --> 52:22.205
And I gotta tell you,

52:22.305 --> 52:24.708
I have never come
so close to dying.

52:24.808 --> 52:27.611
There's no finer fighter
in the Imperium.

52:27.677 --> 52:29.279
They fight like demons.

52:29.346 --> 52:31.214
Desert power.

52:33.650 --> 52:35.385
Duncan.

52:35.485 --> 52:36.953
-Well done.
-Thank you, my lord.

52:37.020 --> 52:38.388
Sire.

52:38.488 --> 52:41.057
Their leader has a knife
he won't surrender, sire.

52:41.158 --> 52:44.227
It's a crysknife.
It's sacred to his people.

52:44.327 --> 52:45.529
Let him pass.

53:02.179 --> 53:03.547
Stop there.

53:03.647 --> 53:05.315
Hey! Hey!

53:08.885 --> 53:09.886
Mm.

53:10.687 --> 53:11.888
Stilgar.

53:12.856 --> 53:14.024
Welcome.

53:15.225 --> 53:17.594
Sir, I respect
the personal dignity

53:17.694 --> 53:19.496
of any man that respects mine.

53:22.766 --> 53:23.833
Hmm.

53:27.370 --> 53:28.572
Hold.

53:29.839 --> 53:31.741
Thank you, Stilgar,

53:31.841 --> 53:35.245
for the gift
of your body's moisture.

53:35.345 --> 53:37.681
We accept it in the spirit
in which it was given.

53:45.689 --> 53:46.756
I'm glad you've come.

53:47.724 --> 53:49.626
I believe your people and mine

53:49.726 --> 53:51.027
have much
to offer one another.

53:51.094 --> 53:52.462
No, no, you are Outworlders.

53:52.562 --> 53:54.231
You come here for the spice,

53:54.297 --> 53:56.766
you take it,
giving nothing in return.

53:58.535 --> 53:59.569
That's true.

54:01.471 --> 54:04.407
I know you've suffered
at the hands of the Harkonnen.

54:05.575 --> 54:07.043
Name what you want.

54:07.110 --> 54:08.311
If it's in my power to grant,

54:08.411 --> 54:09.879
I'll give it
and ask for nothing.

54:09.946 --> 54:12.816
Mm. I ask for this.
Do not seek our  sietches.

54:12.916 --> 54:15.752
Do not trespass in our lands.

54:15.819 --> 54:19.289
The desert was ours
long before you came.

54:19.389 --> 54:21.157
So, come and dig your spice,

54:21.258 --> 54:22.459
but when you have it,

54:22.559 --> 54:24.661
go back to this side
of the Shield Wall

54:24.761 --> 54:26.563
and leave the desert
to the Fremen.

54:26.630 --> 54:29.432
You will address the Duke
as "my lord" or "sire."

54:29.499 --> 54:32.102
Gurney, just...
Just a moment.

54:32.168 --> 54:33.503
The Emperor

54:33.603 --> 54:36.339
has given me Arrakis
as my fief

54:36.439 --> 54:38.174
to rule and protect.

54:38.275 --> 54:40.777
I cannot promise
not to travel into the desert

54:40.844 --> 54:43.680
if duty compels me.

54:43.780 --> 54:46.683
But your  sietches
will be yours forever.

54:46.783 --> 54:49.352
And you will never be hunted
while I govern here.

54:53.857 --> 54:55.692
That's very honorable.

54:55.792 --> 54:58.461
I must go. That's all
I have to say to you.

54:58.528 --> 55:00.697
Won't you stay?

55:00.797 --> 55:02.165
We would honor you.

55:02.265 --> 55:05.335
Honor requires
that I be elsewhere.

55:17.013 --> 55:18.281
I don't like him.

55:18.348 --> 55:20.617
Our plan bears fruit.

55:20.684 --> 55:22.118
But it will take time?

55:22.185 --> 55:23.453
Yes.

55:24.387 --> 55:26.690
It will take time.

55:29.459 --> 55:30.827
Here, this is for you.

55:34.898 --> 55:36.900
It's a paracompass.

55:37.000 --> 55:39.502
The moons here
have a magnetic field, so...

55:39.569 --> 55:42.205
a simple compass needle
won't point north.

55:42.305 --> 55:44.407
Takes a clever piece
of clockwork to sort it out.

55:44.507 --> 55:46.176
The Fremen make these?

55:46.242 --> 55:48.078
And stillsuits,
and sand compactors,

55:48.178 --> 55:49.579
and all kinds
of ingenious things.

55:49.679 --> 55:51.648
What the hell
is a sand compactor?

55:53.850 --> 55:54.918
That's a sand compactor.

55:56.186 --> 55:58.922
My God, man,
you've gone native.

55:59.022 --> 56:00.323
You admire them.

56:01.591 --> 56:03.093
I do.

56:03.193 --> 56:05.862
They're fierce but loyal.

56:05.929 --> 56:07.731
They're attuned to the desert.

56:07.831 --> 56:09.065
Part of it.

56:09.165 --> 56:11.267
It's part of them.

56:11.368 --> 56:12.535
You wait till you see it.

56:13.370 --> 56:14.771
It's beautiful out there.

56:18.041 --> 56:20.076
Sunrise warning, all workers.

56:20.176 --> 56:23.113
Temperature today
will reach 140 degrees.

56:23.213 --> 56:24.948
We are currently 90 degrees,

56:25.048 --> 56:28.418
and in 10 minutes,
we will hit 120 degrees.

56:29.519 --> 56:30.787
Last warning call.

57:04.087 --> 57:06.256
The Judge of the Change, sire.

57:06.322 --> 57:08.291
Dr. Liet Kynes.

57:08.391 --> 57:09.793
My lord Duke.

57:10.593 --> 57:12.162
Welcome to Arrakis.

57:12.262 --> 57:14.330
You're
the Imperial Ecologist.

57:14.431 --> 57:16.332
Thank you for the stillsuits.

57:16.433 --> 57:18.501
They are of Fremen make.

57:18.601 --> 57:19.669
The best.

57:19.769 --> 57:21.070
With your permission, sire,

57:21.137 --> 57:22.505
I must check
the integrity of your suit...

57:22.605 --> 57:23.740
Whoa.

57:24.441 --> 57:25.642
It's all right.

57:27.277 --> 57:29.479
It's all right.

57:29.579 --> 57:33.149
Dr. Kynes,
we're in your hands.

57:37.687 --> 57:38.855
A stillsuit

57:38.955 --> 57:42.926
is a high-efficiency
filtration system.

57:42.992 --> 57:44.594
Even this early
in the morning,

57:44.661 --> 57:47.464
you wouldn't survive two hours
without one of these.

57:48.364 --> 57:50.633
It cools the body

57:50.700 --> 57:54.537
and recycles
the water lost to sweat.

57:54.637 --> 57:57.941
Your body's movements
provide the power.

57:58.007 --> 57:59.709
Inside the mask,
you'll find a tube

57:59.809 --> 58:01.878
to allow you to drink
the recycled water.

58:01.978 --> 58:03.213
Mm.

58:03.313 --> 58:04.647
In good working order,
your suit won't lose

58:04.714 --> 58:07.016
more than a thimbleful
of water a day.

58:07.116 --> 58:08.451
Most impressive.

58:10.153 --> 58:11.488
Let's have a look at you, lad.

58:13.823 --> 58:15.225
You've...

58:15.325 --> 58:16.526
worn a stillsuit before?

58:16.626 --> 58:18.228
No, this is my first time.

58:20.463 --> 58:23.066
Your desert boots are fitted
slip-fashion at the ankles.

58:23.166 --> 58:25.001
Who taught you to do that?

58:25.068 --> 58:27.136
It seemed the right way.

58:34.844 --> 58:35.912
Are you Fremen?

58:37.680 --> 58:41.584
I am accepted
in both  sietch  and village.

58:41.684 --> 58:44.354
Now, come and see
the spice sands

58:44.420 --> 58:47.490
on which
your livelihood depends.

59:25.428 --> 59:26.629
What would you do

59:26.729 --> 59:28.264
if your ornithopter
went down out here?

59:28.364 --> 59:30.466
You wouldn't want
to go down out there.

59:30.567 --> 59:32.135
It's worm territory.

59:34.771 --> 59:35.872
Dust cloud.

59:36.940 --> 59:39.142
I see it.

59:39.242 --> 59:41.377
That's one of your harvesters.

1:00:07.303 --> 1:00:08.471
You can see the spice

1:00:08.571 --> 1:00:10.440
scattered over the surface.

1:00:11.941 --> 1:00:13.943
A rich spice bed

1:00:14.010 --> 1:00:15.478
by the color.

1:00:15.578 --> 1:00:18.081
If you get a little higher,
you'll have a better view.

1:00:32.795 --> 1:00:35.431
You see these spotter aircraft
looking for wormsign.

1:00:37.467 --> 1:00:38.668
Wormsign?

1:00:38.768 --> 1:00:41.037
A sand wave
moving toward the crawler.

1:00:41.137 --> 1:00:43.339
Worms travel deep
but get closer

1:00:43.439 --> 1:00:44.807
to the surface
when they attack.

1:00:45.608 --> 1:00:47.110
If you are patient,

1:00:47.977 --> 1:00:50.046
we should see one.

1:00:50.146 --> 1:00:51.614
A worm always comes?

1:00:51.681 --> 1:00:54.484
Always. They're drawn
by rhythmic noises.

1:00:54.550 --> 1:00:56.653
Why don't we just shield
the crawlers?

1:00:56.719 --> 1:00:59.222
A shield's a death sentence
in the desert.

1:00:59.322 --> 1:01:00.556
It attracts the worms

1:01:00.657 --> 1:01:03.326
and drives them
into a killing frenzy.

1:01:06.062 --> 1:01:07.130
Is that a worm?

1:01:19.342 --> 1:01:21.144
Big one.

1:01:21.210 --> 1:01:23.546
You have good eyes.

1:01:23.646 --> 1:01:25.882
Calling crawler
Delta Ajax niner.

1:01:25.982 --> 1:01:28.484
Wormsign warning. Acknowledge.

1:01:28.551 --> 1:01:31.254
Who calls Delta Ajax niner?

1:01:31.354 --> 1:01:32.388
Over.

1:01:32.488 --> 1:01:33.890
They seem pretty calm
about it.

1:01:33.990 --> 1:01:36.492
Unlisted flight.
Imperium business.

1:01:36.559 --> 1:01:38.728
Wormsign north
and east of you.

1:01:38.828 --> 1:01:40.830
3.7 kilometers.

1:01:40.897 --> 1:01:42.432
Delta Ajax niner,

1:01:42.532 --> 1:01:44.333
this is Spotter One.
Wormsign confirmed.

1:01:45.702 --> 1:01:48.004
Stand by for contact fix.

1:01:51.541 --> 1:01:54.110
Worm is on intercept course
to your position.

1:01:54.210 --> 1:01:55.778
Contact in five minutes.

1:01:55.878 --> 1:01:57.680
So, what happens now?

1:01:57.747 --> 1:02:00.283
They'll call a carryall
to lift the crawler.

1:02:00.383 --> 1:02:02.518
They'll harvest right up
to the last minute.

1:02:02.585 --> 1:02:04.220
Calling
carryall Alpha Zero.

1:02:04.287 --> 1:02:06.122
Ready for docking sequence.

1:02:06.222 --> 1:02:08.691
Contact five minutes. Over.

1:02:13.062 --> 1:02:15.198
Anybody got a visual
on the carryall?

1:02:19.402 --> 1:02:20.903
There it is.

1:02:20.970 --> 1:02:22.305
This is carryall Alpha Zero

1:02:22.405 --> 1:02:24.741
to Delta Ajax niner.

1:02:24.807 --> 1:02:26.876
Approaching from your east.

1:02:26.943 --> 1:02:29.812
Correcting altitude and
preparing docking equipment.

1:02:29.912 --> 1:02:33.416
Copy, Alpha Zero.
Initiating docking sequence.

1:02:35.451 --> 1:02:36.953
T-5.

1:02:37.053 --> 1:02:38.488
Copy that.

1:02:38.588 --> 1:02:40.323
Prepare
to be airborne in 30 seconds.

1:02:40.423 --> 1:02:42.725
Docking sequence
initiated. Brace yourselves.

1:02:46.095 --> 1:02:48.131
Alpha Zero, we're short
one point of contact.

1:02:48.231 --> 1:02:49.665
What is going on?

1:02:49.766 --> 1:02:51.768
It's one of
the anchors. It's dead.

1:02:52.769 --> 1:02:54.137
Shit.

1:02:54.237 --> 1:02:56.272
Carryall
unable to receive.

1:02:56.339 --> 1:02:58.241
Unable to lift
without that anchor.

1:02:58.307 --> 1:03:00.009
All call! All call!

1:03:00.109 --> 1:03:03.079
Any carryall in the sector,
please respond!

1:03:03.146 --> 1:03:05.114
Spotter One,
give us an update. Over.

1:03:05.181 --> 1:03:06.649
Hydraulics are dead.

1:03:06.749 --> 1:03:08.317
We won't make it.
You have to evacuate.

1:03:08.417 --> 1:03:09.485
Contact in four minutes.

1:03:09.585 --> 1:03:10.520
Try it again!

1:03:10.620 --> 1:03:11.320
How many men on that crawler?

1:03:11.420 --> 1:03:12.488
Crew of 21.

1:03:12.588 --> 1:03:13.589
Our ships
can take six each.

1:03:13.656 --> 1:03:14.824
That's still three short.

1:03:15.525 --> 1:03:16.592
We'll find a way.

1:03:28.871 --> 1:03:31.140
This is Duke Leto Atreides.

1:03:31.207 --> 1:03:34.844
We're coming down to extract
the crew of Delta Ajax niner.

1:03:34.944 --> 1:03:36.946
We'll set down on the west.

1:03:47.223 --> 1:03:49.225
Shield generators
weigh 100 kilos each.

1:03:49.992 --> 1:03:51.360
Yes, Gurney,

1:03:51.460 --> 1:03:52.728
have our escorts throw out
the shield generators.

1:03:52.829 --> 1:03:54.363
Yes, sire.

1:03:54.463 --> 1:03:56.032
And, Paul, I want you
at the back of the thopter.

1:03:56.132 --> 1:03:57.200
Guide them in.

1:03:57.300 --> 1:03:58.501
Delta Ajax niner,

1:03:58.568 --> 1:04:01.070
put seven men each
in my ships now.

1:04:59.395 --> 1:05:01.430
Contact in two minutes.

1:05:03.532 --> 1:05:06.369
Getting close, guys.
We better abandon ship now.

1:05:08.738 --> 1:05:10.039
Where are they?

1:05:10.106 --> 1:05:12.141
Sir,
there's protocol for a reason.

1:05:12.241 --> 1:05:14.944
If we take one step out there,
we're as good as dead.

1:05:15.044 --> 1:05:16.646
Besides, we've got
a full load of spice.

1:05:16.746 --> 1:05:18.781
-We can't just leave it.
-Damn the spice!

1:05:18.881 --> 1:05:21.484
I want every man
off that crawler now!

1:05:35.464 --> 1:05:36.565
Hey!

1:05:36.632 --> 1:05:37.733
Hey!

1:05:37.800 --> 1:05:40.336
Seven over here,
seven over there.

1:05:42.271 --> 1:05:44.674
Go! Go! Go!

1:05:59.622 --> 1:06:02.591
Kwisatz Haderach.

1:06:15.771 --> 1:06:19.208
Kwisatz Haderach  awakes.

1:06:28.684 --> 1:06:30.052
Hurry! Get on!

1:06:38.728 --> 1:06:39.829
It's here!

1:06:42.798 --> 1:06:43.833
Paul!

1:06:46.302 --> 1:06:47.536
Paul!

1:06:51.374 --> 1:06:54.810
I recognize
your footsteps, old man.

1:06:55.478 --> 1:06:57.046
Get up!

1:06:57.146 --> 1:06:59.682
Let's go!

1:06:59.749 --> 1:07:02.385
What's the matter with you?
Come on! Let's go!

1:07:02.485 --> 1:07:03.719
Run!

1:07:29.412 --> 1:07:30.446
Hey!

1:07:48.964 --> 1:07:51.400
Bless the Maker and His Water.

1:07:51.467 --> 1:07:53.702
Bless the coming
and going of Him.

1:07:53.769 --> 1:07:56.705
May His passage
cleanse the world

1:07:56.772 --> 1:07:59.275
and keep the world
for His people.

1:08:23.265 --> 1:08:24.500
Hey!

1:08:24.600 --> 1:08:26.635
-You cannot take such risks.
- Yes, sir.

1:08:26.735 --> 1:08:28.003
You have responsibilities.

1:08:28.104 --> 1:08:29.238
I... I'm sorry, sir.
It won't happen again.

1:08:29.305 --> 1:08:30.306
Go.

1:08:31.140 --> 1:08:32.441
Dr. Kynes.

1:08:34.276 --> 1:08:36.112
You saw it.

1:08:36.178 --> 1:08:38.180
With your own eyes.
It's plain to see.

1:08:38.280 --> 1:08:40.516
Everything they've left us
is in shambles.

1:08:40.616 --> 1:08:42.518
We've been set up to fail.

1:08:42.618 --> 1:08:45.321
That carryall was just old.

1:08:45.421 --> 1:08:47.456
The desert
isn't kind to equipment.

1:08:49.325 --> 1:08:50.860
You know what will happen

1:08:50.960 --> 1:08:53.462
if I don't get spice
production back on track.

1:08:55.431 --> 1:08:59.268
I'm not here
to take your part.

1:08:59.335 --> 1:09:03.372
Arrakis has seen men like you
come and go.

1:09:06.008 --> 1:09:09.645
Take good care of your family.

1:09:12.982 --> 1:09:16.118
The desert's not kind
to humans either.

1:09:32.501 --> 1:09:35.571
Spice is a psychoactive
chemical.

1:09:36.739 --> 1:09:38.707
You seem to be sensitive.

1:09:43.078 --> 1:09:44.146
You'll be fine.

1:09:45.848 --> 1:09:47.883
Thank you, Dr. Yueh.

1:09:57.259 --> 1:09:59.762
That wasn't
an allergic reaction.

1:10:01.697 --> 1:10:03.365
I had a vision.

1:10:05.868 --> 1:10:07.603
My eyes were wide open.

1:10:09.572 --> 1:10:10.606
What did you see?

1:10:48.077 --> 1:10:51.814
Kwisatz Haderach.

1:10:51.914 --> 1:10:54.950
You can see.

1:11:36.358 --> 1:11:38.027
It's confusing.

1:11:38.127 --> 1:11:39.662
I thought I saw my death,

1:11:39.762 --> 1:11:41.930
only it wasn't.

1:11:41.997 --> 1:11:45.868
I know a knife is important,
somehow.

1:11:47.803 --> 1:11:50.172
Someone will hand me a blade,

1:11:50.272 --> 1:11:53.976
but I don't know who,
or when, or where.

1:11:56.045 --> 1:11:59.048
Some things, though,
are crystal clear.

1:11:59.148 --> 1:12:00.482
I can feel it.

1:12:05.187 --> 1:12:06.722
I know you're pregnant.

1:12:12.828 --> 1:12:14.630
You can't know that.

1:12:16.165 --> 1:12:17.366
I barely know that.

1:12:17.466 --> 1:12:19.468
It's only been a few weeks.

1:12:29.645 --> 1:12:32.214
[priest throat-singing
in Sardaukar]

1:13:10.586 --> 1:13:11.854
Atreides legions

1:13:11.920 --> 1:13:14.256
are the finest
in the Imperium.

1:13:14.356 --> 1:13:16.725
Trained by Gurney Halleck
and Duncan Idaho.

1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:26.635
Just so.

1:13:27.536 --> 1:13:29.204
Three battalions.

1:13:29.271 --> 1:13:30.305
As agreed.

1:14:10.779 --> 1:14:13.015
There is something
you need to know about Paul.

1:14:13.115 --> 1:14:15.017
No.

1:14:15.117 --> 1:14:17.519
Don't think I want to know.

1:14:17.619 --> 1:14:19.621
Ever since you brought him
before your Reverend Mother,

1:14:19.688 --> 1:14:21.523
he hasn't been the same.

1:14:23.192 --> 1:14:24.493
He's distracted.

1:14:26.428 --> 1:14:29.531
Jessica, you gave me a son.

1:14:29.631 --> 1:14:30.999
And from the moment
he was born,

1:14:31.099 --> 1:14:32.968
I never questioned you.

1:14:33.035 --> 1:14:35.504
I trusted you completely.

1:14:35.604 --> 1:14:37.773
Even when
you walked in shadows.

1:14:38.941 --> 1:14:40.876
Now I'm asking you
this one thing.

1:14:43.512 --> 1:14:45.681
If anything happens...

1:14:46.782 --> 1:14:48.150
will you protect our son?

1:14:49.885 --> 1:14:51.386
With my life.

1:14:51.487 --> 1:14:53.889
I'm not asking his mother.
I'm asking the Bene Gesserit.

1:14:58.126 --> 1:15:00.162
Will you protect Paul?

1:15:05.734 --> 1:15:07.736
Why are you
having these thoughts?

1:15:14.209 --> 1:15:16.745
Leto, this is not you.

1:15:22.351 --> 1:15:24.753
I thought we'd have more time.

1:15:43.705 --> 1:15:46.341
Have a good night,
Master Paul.

1:15:46.408 --> 1:15:48.343
Good night, Dr. Yueh.

1:15:57.619 --> 1:15:59.054
You need to sleep.

1:16:00.889 --> 1:16:02.257
No.

1:16:02.357 --> 1:16:03.625
Not like that.

1:16:18.907 --> 1:16:21.143
I should have married you.

1:17:39.388 --> 1:17:41.156
Hawat. Security.

1:17:43.492 --> 1:17:44.893
Security.

1:18:47.789 --> 1:18:49.458
Sir. Sir.

1:18:50.358 --> 1:18:52.127
The shield's come down.

1:18:52.227 --> 1:18:54.463
-

1:19:01.036 --> 1:19:02.971
God in heaven.

1:19:03.071 --> 1:19:06.041
Get everything with guns
off the ground! Go!

1:19:50.018 --> 1:19:51.820
Go! Go! Go!

1:20:53.715 --> 1:20:55.717
With me! With me!

1:21:24.713 --> 1:21:25.780
Atreides!

1:21:25.881 --> 1:21:27.048
Atreides!

1:21:55.911 --> 1:21:58.280
Sardaukar!
- Sardaukar!

1:22:21.770 --> 1:22:23.438
I'm sorry, my lord.

1:22:26.274 --> 1:22:29.244
But I've made a bargain
with the Baron.

1:22:31.780 --> 1:22:32.781
Why?

1:22:33.648 --> 1:22:35.684
I had no choice.

1:22:35.784 --> 1:22:39.621
The Harkonnens
have my wife, Wanna.

1:22:39.688 --> 1:22:42.257
They take her apart
like a doll.

1:22:43.258 --> 1:22:45.360
I will buy her freedom.

1:22:45.460 --> 1:22:47.028
And you are the price.

1:22:50.365 --> 1:22:53.435
For Paul.
I will do what I can.

1:22:54.135 --> 1:22:55.837
And you

1:22:55.937 --> 1:22:57.806
will kill a man for me.

1:23:02.177 --> 1:23:05.714
I'm going to replace
your peg tooth.

1:23:05.814 --> 1:23:10.719
If you bite down hard,
this tooth will crush.

1:23:10.819 --> 1:23:15.056
Breathe out, and you will
fill the air with poison.

1:23:15.156 --> 1:23:17.859
It will be your last breath.

1:23:17.959 --> 1:23:20.295
But if you choose
your moment well,

1:23:21.563 --> 1:23:23.865
it will also be the Baron's.

1:24:57.592 --> 1:24:58.660
Paul.

1:26:21.509 --> 1:26:23.244
To hell, dogs!

1:27:58.840 --> 1:28:01.643
I've never had a highborn.

1:28:04.012 --> 1:28:05.346
You?

1:28:05.446 --> 1:28:07.515
Bene Gesserit
ain't all highborn.

1:28:07.615 --> 1:28:11.419
She's highborn enough for me.

1:28:11.486 --> 1:28:13.755
Let's feed the kid
to the worms.

1:28:13.821 --> 1:28:15.823
And give her a long goodbye.

1:28:15.923 --> 1:28:17.692
Don't you dare
touch my mother.

1:28:19.160 --> 1:28:20.194
Don't talk.

1:28:31.539 --> 1:28:33.041
Remove her gag.

1:28:42.150 --> 1:28:43.951
Shut up.

1:29:12.880 --> 1:29:14.148
Remove her gag.

1:29:20.221 --> 1:29:21.422
Kill him.

1:29:30.398 --> 1:29:31.566
Set us free.

1:29:45.046 --> 1:29:46.381
Stop!

1:29:46.447 --> 1:29:48.015
Cut the rope.

1:29:50.718 --> 1:29:52.186
Give me the knife.

1:30:00.895 --> 1:30:03.965
Your pitch was too forced.

1:30:11.873 --> 1:30:13.441
It's a fremkit.

1:30:26.421 --> 1:30:27.622
They've crippled the ship.

1:31:40.661 --> 1:31:41.829
Mmm.

1:32:00.147 --> 1:32:01.549
Ah.

1:32:03.017 --> 1:32:06.087
You have a wonderful kitchen,
cousin.

1:32:24.272 --> 1:32:27.108
This is Dr. Yueh's
handwriting.

1:32:27.208 --> 1:32:29.777
"If anyone makes it out
of Arrakeen alive,

1:32:29.877 --> 1:32:32.013
there's an Atreides beacon
in the fremkit.

1:32:32.079 --> 1:32:34.849
God willing,
they'll be able to find you."

1:32:42.189 --> 1:32:43.224
My lord Baron.

1:32:44.625 --> 1:32:45.793
Dr. Yueh.

1:32:45.893 --> 1:32:47.562
The traitor.

1:32:48.763 --> 1:32:49.897
What do you want?

1:32:51.065 --> 1:32:53.301
I jammed their comms

1:32:53.401 --> 1:32:55.403
and lowered their shields.

1:32:55.469 --> 1:32:56.737
Hmm.

1:32:56.804 --> 1:32:59.073
I delivered
the Duke and his family.

1:32:59.140 --> 1:33:01.642
The bargain
to the letter.

1:33:01.742 --> 1:33:04.245
And what was I to do for you?

1:33:04.312 --> 1:33:06.480
Deliver my wife
from her agony.

1:33:08.416 --> 1:33:09.483
Yes.

1:33:42.950 --> 1:33:45.586
I said I'd set her free.

1:33:45.653 --> 1:33:47.488
That you could join her.

1:33:51.626 --> 1:33:53.527
So, join her.

1:33:53.628 --> 1:33:55.496
-

1:34:02.436 --> 1:34:04.672
What do you think is next?

1:34:08.342 --> 1:34:10.645
It's a thumper.

1:34:10.711 --> 1:34:12.313
No stillsuits.

1:34:12.380 --> 1:34:14.315
The one thing
we actually need.

1:34:19.387 --> 1:34:22.990
For hundreds of years,
we've traded blood for blood.

1:34:24.191 --> 1:34:25.860
But no more.

1:34:27.328 --> 1:34:31.565
Your son is dead.
Your concubine is dead.

1:34:31.666 --> 1:34:34.535
Tonight
the House of Atreides falls.

1:34:37.338 --> 1:34:40.408
And your bloodline
ends forever.

1:34:53.587 --> 1:34:54.655
What did you say?

1:35:04.699 --> 1:35:06.167
Here I am...

1:35:07.435 --> 1:35:09.236
here I remain.

1:35:14.041 --> 1:35:16.043
-

1:36:52.473 --> 1:36:53.674
Kynes!

1:36:54.942 --> 1:36:56.710
It's not safe for you here.

1:36:56.811 --> 1:36:58.045
Will you tell
the Great Houses

1:36:58.145 --> 1:36:59.613
of the Landsraad
how we were betrayed?

1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:02.283
How the best of them
were murdered?

1:37:02.349 --> 1:37:05.019
I am commanded to say nothing.

1:37:05.986 --> 1:37:07.688
To see nothing.

1:37:09.523 --> 1:37:11.892
The Emperor
sent us here to die.

1:38:00.107 --> 1:38:02.509
There's spice
in the tent.

1:39:28.128 --> 1:39:31.098
That's the future.
It's coming.

1:39:45.646 --> 1:39:47.848
Holy war
spreading across the universe

1:39:47.948 --> 1:39:49.216
like unquenchable fire.

1:40:02.162 --> 1:40:05.065
Paul, you're scared.
I can see it.

1:40:05.165 --> 1:40:08.235
Tell me, please,
what do you fear?

1:40:17.211 --> 1:40:19.713
Somebody help me, please.

1:40:20.414 --> 1:40:21.582
Paul.

1:40:23.884 --> 1:40:25.586
It's coming.

1:40:25.686 --> 1:40:27.087
I see a holy war spreading

1:40:27.187 --> 1:40:29.089
across the universe
like unquenchable fire.

1:40:29.189 --> 1:40:32.192
A warrior religion
that waves the Atreides banner

1:40:32.259 --> 1:40:33.427
in my father's name.

1:40:33.527 --> 1:40:34.428
Paul.

1:40:34.528 --> 1:40:36.196
Fanatical legions worshipping

1:40:36.263 --> 1:40:38.432
at the shrine
of my father's skull.

1:40:39.266 --> 1:40:41.735
A war in my name!

1:40:41.835 --> 1:40:43.670
Everyone's shouting my name!

1:40:43.737 --> 1:40:44.738
Paul.

1:40:48.409 --> 1:40:50.511
Paul Atreides.

1:40:50.577 --> 1:40:53.547
You are your father's son.
You are my son.

1:40:53.614 --> 1:40:57.117
You are
the Duke Paul Atreides.

1:40:57.217 --> 1:41:00.020
You know who you are.
You know who you are.

1:41:00.087 --> 1:41:01.255
Get off me!

1:41:03.190 --> 1:41:04.858
You did this to me!

1:41:04.925 --> 1:41:07.628
You Bene Gesserit
made me a freak!

1:41:32.753 --> 1:41:35.055
My father is dead.

1:42:11.525 --> 1:42:13.026
Someone's near.

1:42:13.961 --> 1:42:15.462
You need to drink.

1:42:17.030 --> 1:42:19.333
It's recycled water
from the tent.

1:42:27.141 --> 1:42:28.942
Sweat and tears.

1:42:32.613 --> 1:42:34.314
All right,
let's get out of here.

1:43:47.554 --> 1:43:49.289
That's Duncan.

1:43:56.396 --> 1:43:57.631
Duncan.

1:43:59.266 --> 1:44:00.467
My lady.

1:44:00.567 --> 1:44:01.969
Paul.

1:44:02.069 --> 1:44:04.438
I'm so sorry. Your father...

1:44:04.538 --> 1:44:05.739
We know.

1:44:07.641 --> 1:44:08.976
My lord Duke.

1:44:22.756 --> 1:44:23.757
Here.

1:44:25.826 --> 1:44:27.327
Drink this.

1:44:34.601 --> 1:44:36.970
Harkonnens hit
every population center

1:44:37.070 --> 1:44:38.505
on the planet at once.

1:44:38.605 --> 1:44:40.741
There must have been
10 legions, hundreds of ships.

1:44:40.807 --> 1:44:42.843
There were Sardaukar
with them.

1:44:42.943 --> 1:44:45.479
-At least two battalions.
-What? Are you sure?

1:44:45.579 --> 1:44:48.248
You cross swords
with a Sardaukar,

1:44:48.315 --> 1:44:49.683
you know it.

1:44:49.783 --> 1:44:54.521
So,
the Emperor's taken a side.

1:44:54.621 --> 1:44:57.758
What says
the Judge of the Change?

1:44:57.824 --> 1:44:59.860
The Emperor forbids me
from saying anything at all.

1:44:59.960 --> 1:45:01.928
And yet you risk your life
to help us.

1:45:20.380 --> 1:45:22.316
-

1:45:22.382 --> 1:45:24.117
Storm's coming.

1:45:37.998 --> 1:45:40.233
The storm
will be here in a few hours.

1:45:40.334 --> 1:45:41.468
We'll be safe here.

1:45:43.003 --> 1:45:45.238
Do you know
what this place is?

1:45:45.339 --> 1:45:47.741
It's an old
ecological testing station.

1:45:51.144 --> 1:45:52.979
They were meant
to tame the planet.

1:45:53.046 --> 1:45:55.482
Free the water
locked beneath the sands.

1:45:58.485 --> 1:46:01.088
Arrakis could have been
a paradise.

1:46:01.188 --> 1:46:02.322
The work had begun,

1:46:02.389 --> 1:46:04.057
but then the spice
was discovered.

1:46:04.157 --> 1:46:07.160
And suddenly no one
wanted the desert to go away.

1:46:07.227 --> 1:46:08.428
Tanat,

1:46:08.528 --> 1:46:10.097
will you find stillsuits
to fit our visitors?

1:46:10.197 --> 1:46:11.431
TANAT: Yes, Liet.

1:46:11.531 --> 1:46:12.933
Shamir,
a coffee service, please.

1:46:13.033 --> 1:46:14.501
SHAMIR: Of course, Liet.

1:46:16.837 --> 1:46:18.739
Who are you to the Fremen?

1:47:08.755 --> 1:47:10.490
You know what
the Great Houses fear most,

1:47:10.590 --> 1:47:12.159
Dr. Kynes?

1:47:13.427 --> 1:47:15.662
Exactly what has happened
to us here.

1:47:16.663 --> 1:47:17.831
The Sardaukar coming

1:47:17.931 --> 1:47:19.633
and picking them off
one by one.

1:47:22.602 --> 1:47:24.237
Only together
can they stand a chance

1:47:24.304 --> 1:47:25.806
against the Imperium.

1:47:27.841 --> 1:47:30.010
Would you bear witness?

1:47:30.110 --> 1:47:33.246
Testify that the Emperor
has moved against us here?

1:47:33.313 --> 1:47:36.249
If they believe me,

1:47:36.316 --> 1:47:38.018
there would be general warfare

1:47:38.118 --> 1:47:40.320
between the Great Houses
and the Emperor.

1:47:40.420 --> 1:47:41.988
Chaos

1:47:42.088 --> 1:47:43.523
across the Imperium.

1:47:43.623 --> 1:47:45.025
Suppose I presented
the Emperor

1:47:45.125 --> 1:47:47.594
with an alternative to chaos.

1:47:47.661 --> 1:47:49.596
The Emperor has no sons.

1:47:49.663 --> 1:47:51.665
And his daughters
have yet to marry.

1:47:51.765 --> 1:47:54.534
You'd make a play
for the throne?

1:47:54.634 --> 1:47:56.369
The Emperor
feared the Atreides.

1:47:56.470 --> 1:47:58.138
He brought you here
to kill you.

1:47:58.205 --> 1:48:00.707
What don't you understand?

1:48:00.807 --> 1:48:03.977
You're a lost boy hiding
in a hole in the ground.

1:48:08.181 --> 1:48:10.951
The Fremen speak
of the  Lisan al-Gaib.

1:48:11.952 --> 1:48:13.787
Careful.

1:48:13.854 --> 1:48:15.021
The Voice from the Outer World

1:48:15.121 --> 1:48:17.290
who will lead them
to paradise.

1:48:18.625 --> 1:48:19.826
Superstition.

1:48:24.631 --> 1:48:26.366
I know you loved
a Fremen warrior

1:48:26.466 --> 1:48:27.734
and lost him in battle.

1:48:30.971 --> 1:48:34.674
I know you walk in two worlds
and are known by many names.

1:48:39.913 --> 1:48:41.815
I've seen your dream.

1:48:45.919 --> 1:48:47.153
As emperor, Dr. Kynes,

1:48:47.220 --> 1:48:49.155
I could make
a paradise of Arrakis

1:48:49.222 --> 1:48:50.757
with a wave of my hand.

1:49:41.408 --> 1:49:44.277
-

1:49:44.377 --> 1:49:46.046
-

1:50:46.539 --> 1:50:47.607
Sardaukar!

1:50:50.710 --> 1:50:51.945
No! Duncan!

1:50:52.012 --> 1:50:53.279
Paul, no!

1:50:53.346 --> 1:50:54.648
Duncan, no!
- No!

1:50:55.815 --> 1:50:57.117
No!
- Paul, no!

1:50:58.318 --> 1:50:59.619
Duncan, no!

1:50:59.686 --> 1:51:02.155
-He's locked the door.
- Duncan! No!

1:51:51.538 --> 1:51:53.106
He's gone.

1:51:53.206 --> 1:51:54.274
Duncan!

1:51:54.374 --> 1:51:55.942
We have to go.
We have no choice.

1:52:03.550 --> 1:52:05.952
Paul, go! Paul!

1:52:24.871 --> 1:52:26.539
Come on.
Come on, come on!

1:52:57.904 --> 1:52:59.572
Follow the light.

1:52:59.639 --> 1:53:01.841
You'll find a thopter
ready to fly.

1:53:01.941 --> 1:53:03.810
That storm out there
is your best shot.

1:53:03.910 --> 1:53:06.479
Above 5,000 meters,
it's mostly dust.

1:53:06.579 --> 1:53:10.683
Climb into it. Stay on top.
Head south. Find the Fremen.

1:53:10.784 --> 1:53:12.018
Are you not coming with us?

1:53:12.118 --> 1:53:13.319
It only seats two.

1:53:13.419 --> 1:53:15.121
I'll go to the next station

1:53:15.188 --> 1:53:16.923
and report this attack
to the Landsraad.

1:53:16.990 --> 1:53:18.291
How?

1:53:19.025 --> 1:53:20.960
I'm Fremen.

1:53:21.027 --> 1:53:23.263
The desert's my home.

1:53:23.329 --> 1:53:24.430
Good luck.

1:53:24.497 --> 1:53:25.698
Good luck.

1:55:39.899 --> 1:55:41.467
-

1:56:06.793 --> 1:56:09.195
I serve only one master.

1:56:09.295 --> 1:56:12.632
His name is  Shai-Hulud.

1:56:34.387 --> 1:56:36.956
-

1:56:57.677 --> 1:56:59.245
There are jet flares
behind us.

1:57:33.079 --> 1:57:35.014
Paul. We're not high enough!

1:57:45.291 --> 1:57:46.759
-

1:57:49.929 --> 1:57:51.898
-

1:57:58.471 --> 1:58:00.706
-

1:58:07.747 --> 1:58:09.082
I must not fear.

1:58:09.148 --> 1:58:10.817
Fear is the mind-killer.

1:58:10.917 --> 1:58:14.654
Fear is the little death
that brings obliteration.

1:58:20.259 --> 1:58:23.229
See the friend.

1:58:26.999 --> 1:58:29.902
See the friend.

1:58:32.605 --> 1:58:35.408
The mystery of life
isn't a problem to solve...

1:58:38.611 --> 1:58:40.980
but a reality to experience.

1:58:44.283 --> 1:58:46.519
A process
that cannot be understood

1:58:46.619 --> 1:58:48.855
by stopping it.

1:58:48.955 --> 1:58:51.357
We must move
with the flow of the process.

1:58:52.325 --> 1:58:54.827
We must join it.

1:58:54.927 --> 1:58:56.696
We must flow with it.

1:58:56.796 --> 1:58:58.431
Let go.

1:58:58.498 --> 1:59:00.500
Let go.

1:59:44.644 --> 1:59:47.246
-

1:59:47.346 --> 1:59:51.484
We chased them
into a Coriolis storm.

1:59:52.985 --> 1:59:55.555
Winds at 800 kilometers
an hour.

2:00:00.226 --> 2:00:02.528
Nothing survives such a storm.

2:00:02.595 --> 2:00:04.030
They're dead.

2:00:05.431 --> 2:00:07.266
It's a certainty.

2:00:14.273 --> 2:00:16.576
So, it's done. Finally.

2:00:18.711 --> 2:00:20.546
Send word to Giedi Prime

2:00:20.613 --> 2:00:23.449
to begin selling
our spice reserves.

2:00:24.283 --> 2:00:26.385
But slowly.

2:00:26.452 --> 2:00:29.121
We don't want
the price to fall.

2:00:29.222 --> 2:00:30.723
You have no idea
how much it cost me

2:00:30.790 --> 2:00:33.292
to bring such a force
to bear here.

2:00:33.392 --> 2:00:36.262
Now I only have
one requirement.

2:00:36.362 --> 2:00:37.463
Income.

2:00:38.297 --> 2:00:40.099
So, squeeze, Rabban.

2:00:40.866 --> 2:00:42.301
Squeeze hard.

2:00:42.401 --> 2:00:43.769
Yes, Uncle.

2:00:45.371 --> 2:00:46.472
And the Fremen?

2:00:47.607 --> 2:00:49.041
Kill them all.

2:01:12.098 --> 2:01:14.066
We're above
5,000 meters.

2:01:54.640 --> 2:01:56.609
-

2:02:51.831 --> 2:02:53.766
As soon as we land,
run for the rocks.

2:04:46.946 --> 2:04:48.781
And breathe through this.

2:05:18.978 --> 2:05:21.247
Now
we have to find the Fremen.

2:05:22.815 --> 2:05:24.149
Are you good?

2:05:24.216 --> 2:05:25.584
Yeah.

2:06:32.451 --> 2:06:34.219
Paul...

2:06:40.759 --> 2:06:44.597
Don't be frightened.

2:06:44.663 --> 2:06:47.900
Even a little
desert mouse can survive.

2:06:48.934 --> 2:06:52.104
Don't be frightened.

2:06:52.171 --> 2:06:54.006
You'll need
to face your fears.

2:06:54.106 --> 2:06:55.674
A friend...

2:06:55.774 --> 2:06:58.911
A friend will help you.

2:07:00.279 --> 2:07:02.114
Follow the friend.

2:07:04.950 --> 2:07:06.285
You have much to learn.

2:07:08.487 --> 2:07:11.290
And I will show you
the ways of the desert.

2:07:14.627 --> 2:07:16.195
Come with me.

2:07:43.822 --> 2:07:47.559
The  sietch
where Duncan lived

2:07:47.660 --> 2:07:49.828
is somewhere off that way.

2:07:51.997 --> 2:07:55.000
I can see
greenery over there.

2:07:55.067 --> 2:07:56.235
There.

2:07:56.335 --> 2:07:58.337
That means
Fremen live there.

2:08:02.675 --> 2:08:04.810
We'll cross after dark.

2:08:04.877 --> 2:08:06.879
That's how the Fremen do it.

2:08:09.848 --> 2:08:12.351
We're about to enter
worm territory.

2:08:12.418 --> 2:08:14.253
We can't walk
like regular humans.

2:08:14.353 --> 2:08:15.754
If we do, we're dead.

2:08:15.854 --> 2:08:17.856
We'll have to walk
like the Fremen do.

2:08:17.923 --> 2:08:19.491
It's called a sandwalk.

2:08:19.558 --> 2:08:22.227
At least according
to the filmbooks back home.

2:08:22.327 --> 2:08:23.729
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

2:08:23.829 --> 2:08:25.364
Okay. Follow me.

2:08:25.431 --> 2:08:27.199
Do the same moves.

2:08:40.379 --> 2:08:42.014
I think this is
the right direction.

2:10:04.596 --> 2:10:05.664
It's close by.

2:10:06.532 --> 2:10:08.467
Let's get out of here.

2:10:09.301 --> 2:10:12.171
-Wait.

2:10:12.271 --> 2:10:14.139
-It's drum sand.

2:10:18.777 --> 2:10:20.712
-  run.

2:10:26.652 --> 2:10:28.353
Go! Go!

2:11:40.459 --> 2:11:41.593
It's a thumper.

2:11:46.899 --> 2:11:48.901
Someone set off a thumper.

2:12:03.448 --> 2:12:05.717
Paul! Run!

2:12:20.399 --> 2:12:21.733
How big are they?

2:12:21.800 --> 2:12:23.001
That was insane.

2:12:27.739 --> 2:12:29.274
Someone called it.

2:13:01.206 --> 2:13:03.775
Do not run.

2:13:03.842 --> 2:13:06.478
You will only waste
your body's water.

2:13:07.479 --> 2:13:08.513
Hold.

2:13:16.188 --> 2:13:17.055
Stilgar.

2:13:17.155 --> 2:13:18.724
-Hey!

2:13:18.824 --> 2:13:20.058
You know me. I was there

2:13:20.158 --> 2:13:21.893
when you came
to my father's Council.

2:13:21.994 --> 2:13:22.961
Oh.

2:13:23.028 --> 2:13:25.063
This is the Duke's son.

2:13:25.163 --> 2:13:26.798
Why are you waiting?

2:13:26.865 --> 2:13:28.734
We need their water.

2:13:28.834 --> 2:13:31.069
This is the boy
I told you about.

2:13:31.169 --> 2:13:32.404
We can't touch him.

2:13:36.808 --> 2:13:38.176
They are weaklings.

2:13:38.243 --> 2:13:40.012
Jamis.

2:13:40.078 --> 2:13:41.980
That was a brave crossing
they made

2:13:42.047 --> 2:13:44.916
in the path of  Shai-Hulud.

2:13:45.017 --> 2:13:48.153
He does not speak
or act like a weakling.

2:13:49.187 --> 2:13:50.889
Nor did his father.

2:13:50.989 --> 2:13:53.592
My thumper
saved his life.

2:13:53.692 --> 2:13:56.161
Go back to reason, Stilgar.

2:13:56.228 --> 2:13:57.929
He's not The One.

2:14:00.699 --> 2:14:02.367
We have powerful friends.

2:14:02.434 --> 2:14:05.604
You help us off-world,
to Caladan,

2:14:05.704 --> 2:14:06.938
you will be well rewarded.

2:14:07.039 --> 2:14:09.841
What wealth can you offer
beyond the water

2:14:09.908 --> 2:14:11.443
in your flesh?

2:14:14.246 --> 2:14:16.281
Hmm...

2:14:16.381 --> 2:14:18.016
The boy is young.

2:14:18.083 --> 2:14:20.285
He can learn our ways.

2:14:20.385 --> 2:14:23.021
He may have sanctuary.

2:14:23.088 --> 2:14:25.424
But the woman is untrained...

2:14:28.093 --> 2:14:29.594
and too old to learn.

2:15:00.959 --> 2:15:03.095
- back, you dogs.

2:15:04.729 --> 2:15:06.932
She'll cut my throat.

2:15:11.903 --> 2:15:14.406
Why didn't you say
you were a weirding woman?

2:15:14.473 --> 2:15:16.141
And a fighter?

2:15:16.241 --> 2:15:18.410
Conversation ran short.

2:15:18.477 --> 2:15:20.679
Peace, woman.

2:15:20.779 --> 2:15:22.114
Peace.

2:15:22.914 --> 2:15:24.449
I judged hastily.

2:16:03.655 --> 2:16:06.057
I would not
have let you hurt my friends.

2:16:31.349 --> 2:16:33.919
They say you're the  Mahdi.

2:16:34.019 --> 2:16:35.854
But you look
like a little boy.

2:16:37.355 --> 2:16:38.823
You chose the hardest way up.

2:16:38.890 --> 2:16:40.225
Follow me.

2:16:47.699 --> 2:16:49.267
Give it to me.

2:16:56.208 --> 2:16:57.909
You will have
your own maula pistol

2:16:58.009 --> 2:16:59.911
when you've earned it.

2:17:00.011 --> 2:17:01.046
Give it to me.

2:17:06.785 --> 2:17:08.920
Chani, take charge
of the newcomers.

2:17:09.020 --> 2:17:11.623
See that they are safe
on the journey. Let's go.

2:17:11.723 --> 2:17:13.124
I will not have them.

2:17:20.065 --> 2:17:21.466
Jamis,

2:17:21.566 --> 2:17:23.902
I have spoken. Be still.

2:17:23.969 --> 2:17:25.570
You talk like a leader.

2:17:26.571 --> 2:17:28.440
But the strongest leads.

2:17:29.741 --> 2:17:31.543
She bested you.

2:17:32.944 --> 2:17:35.246
I invoke the amtal.

2:17:35.313 --> 2:17:37.749
You may not challenge
a  Sayyadina.

2:17:37.816 --> 2:17:39.317
Then who will fight
in her name?

2:17:39.417 --> 2:17:42.153
Jamis, don't do this.

2:17:42.254 --> 2:17:44.322
Don't. The night is fading.

2:17:44.422 --> 2:17:47.325
Then the sun
will witness this death.

2:17:47.425 --> 2:17:49.461
Where is her champion?

2:18:00.305 --> 2:18:02.307
I accept her champion.

2:18:34.472 --> 2:18:38.376
Paul Atreides
must die...

2:18:40.145 --> 2:18:44.849
for  Kwisatz Haderach  to rise.

2:18:47.519 --> 2:18:51.222
Don't be frightened.

2:18:51.323 --> 2:18:52.891
Don't resist.

2:18:58.963 --> 2:19:00.899
When you take a life,

2:19:01.833 --> 2:19:03.968
you take your own.

2:19:35.734 --> 2:19:38.203
I don't believe
you're the  Lisan al-Gaib.

2:19:39.704 --> 2:19:41.740
But I want you
to die with honor.

2:19:53.218 --> 2:19:56.054
This crysknife was given to me
by my great aunt.

2:19:59.290 --> 2:20:01.693
It's made
from a tooth of  Shai-Hulud.

2:20:01.760 --> 2:20:03.461
The great sandworm.

2:20:05.096 --> 2:20:07.899
This will be a great honor,
for you to die holding it.

2:20:12.203 --> 2:20:14.572
Where is the Outworlder?

2:20:18.910 --> 2:20:20.812
Jamis is a good fighter.

2:20:21.780 --> 2:20:23.448
He won't let you suffer.

2:20:24.916 --> 2:20:26.551
Chani...

2:20:29.654 --> 2:20:30.722
Um...

2:20:38.763 --> 2:20:39.964
Never mind.

2:21:35.320 --> 2:21:37.489
May thy knife
chip and shatter.

2:21:45.296 --> 2:21:47.232
You should welcome my blade.

2:21:50.735 --> 2:21:52.504
This world will kill you.

2:21:55.874 --> 2:21:57.408
Quicker this way.

2:22:08.353 --> 2:22:11.222
-

2:22:37.048 --> 2:22:38.683
-Do you yield?
-

2:22:40.919 --> 2:22:42.787
The boy doesn't know our rule.

2:22:44.222 --> 2:22:45.790
There's no yielding
under the amtal rule.

2:22:45.890 --> 2:22:47.559
Only death is the test of it.

2:22:55.967 --> 2:22:57.902
-Is he toying with him?
-No.

2:22:59.237 --> 2:23:00.905
Paul has never killed a man.

2:23:11.649 --> 2:23:16.087
Kwisatz Haderach.

2:23:19.123 --> 2:23:22.160
Kwisatz Haderach.

2:23:22.260 --> 2:23:26.130
Climb up. Rise.

2:25:18.543 --> 2:25:20.445
You're one of us now.

2:25:20.545 --> 2:25:22.380
A life for a life.

2:25:22.447 --> 2:25:24.515
Come with us to  Sietch  Tabr.

2:25:24.582 --> 2:25:25.616
No.

2:25:25.717 --> 2:25:27.251
Paul needs to get off-world.

2:25:27.351 --> 2:25:29.420
You must have ways.
You have smugglers,

2:25:29.520 --> 2:25:30.755
you have ships.

2:25:30.855 --> 2:25:32.957
No.
- You have...

2:25:33.057 --> 2:25:35.126
The Emperor sent us
to this place.

2:25:36.561 --> 2:25:38.296
And my father came,

2:25:39.230 --> 2:25:41.532
not for spice,

2:25:41.599 --> 2:25:43.901
not for the riches,

2:25:43.968 --> 2:25:46.104
but for the strength
of your people.

2:25:49.107 --> 2:25:51.209
My road leads into the desert.

2:25:53.878 --> 2:25:55.246
I can see it.

2:25:57.749 --> 2:25:59.383
If you'll have us,

2:26:00.284 --> 2:26:01.886
we will come.

2:26:50.501 --> 2:26:52.003
Desert power.

2:26:53.304 --> 2:26:55.006
This is only the beginning.
