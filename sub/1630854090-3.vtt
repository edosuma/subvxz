WEBVTT

00:06.666 --> 00:07.500
Sky.

00:16.541 --> 00:19.541
-Andreas burnt the house down.
-Yeah, I know.

00:21.500 --> 00:23.500
He has a temper.

00:23.583 --> 00:24.541
Always did.

00:26.541 --> 00:28.375
Must have missed that bedtime story.

00:29.041 --> 00:31.416
Do you mind
taking this piece of shit back?

00:31.500 --> 00:33.166
I know it's not really Andreas's.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.500
It's been a few months,

00:37.583 --> 00:39.750
and you're already starting
to sound like him.

00:39.833 --> 00:42.208
-How did you even get in here?
-Harvey.

00:42.958 --> 00:45.000
-You and I need to talk.
-No, we don't.

00:45.666 --> 00:48.833
You're gonna get caught,
sneaking into the school late at night.

00:48.916 --> 00:53.500
-After what Bloom did to get you out.
-Look, I had a close call today, Sky.

00:53.583 --> 00:57.666
And it made me realize it's only
a matter of time before they find me.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.166
What do you expect me to do?

00:59.250 --> 01:01.541
I'm not gonna go into exile
without seeing you.

01:02.708 --> 01:05.375
I am saying I am sorry.

01:05.458 --> 01:07.625
Okay. You said it.

01:08.958 --> 01:09.958
You can go now.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.416
Just tell me
what I need to do to fix this.

01:15.083 --> 01:19.125
Leave. Alfea. Blackbridge. All of it.

01:20.125 --> 01:22.166
Leave, and never come back.

01:38.125 --> 01:39.541
Saul!

01:40.750 --> 01:42.458
How nice of you to join us.

01:44.458 --> 01:45.666
How did you find me?

01:45.750 --> 01:48.750
Luckily, some people
still care about the rule of law.

01:48.833 --> 01:51.000
-I'm so sorry.
-So different.

01:52.666 --> 01:54.833
And yet you share the same weakness.

01:56.208 --> 01:58.375
And that is why I never had kids.

01:59.916 --> 02:02.375
Take him to the East Wing. We've got room.

02:39.041 --> 02:41.250
-Um…

02:41.333 --> 02:44.583
-I swear you gave me all the heavy stuff.
-You volunteered for this.

02:44.666 --> 02:46.875
Uh, I volunteered
for a simple banquet errand

02:46.958 --> 02:49.208
so we could leave school
and see Sebastian.

02:49.291 --> 02:53.250
Then someone came up with additional ideas
to make the banquet really sing.

02:53.333 --> 02:55.208
The Alumni Banquet is a big deal.

02:55.291 --> 02:58.875
Every important Alfea grad
from the past 50 years will be there.

02:59.666 --> 03:03.750
And you want them to know
that you helped with the centerpieces?

03:04.708 --> 03:06.125
You really wanna know?

03:07.500 --> 03:08.333
Yeah.

03:08.833 --> 03:11.166
Tonight was always step one
of my 20-year plan.

03:11.666 --> 03:14.416
Headmistress Dowling
would sing my praises to the alums.

03:14.500 --> 03:18.250
I'd intern for one of them at the Capitol,
come back to Alfea to teach,

03:18.333 --> 03:19.541
work my way up.

03:19.625 --> 03:22.500
Eventually, at an Alumni Banquet,
Dowling would step down,

03:22.583 --> 03:23.791
I'd become headmistress.

03:25.333 --> 03:27.958
That look's why I don't tell anyone
about my 20-year plan.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.458
No! I guess I'm just…

03:31.250 --> 03:34.625
I'm realizing the furthest
I've thought ahead is, like, lunch.

03:34.708 --> 03:36.333
To be honest, I'm wavering on that.

03:36.416 --> 03:39.250
You've never thought
about your life after Alfea?

03:39.750 --> 03:44.250
I mean, back in Gardenia, all I wanted
was to be out of high school, but…

03:45.541 --> 03:48.583
I dunno. Live a normal life.
Be an artist or engineer.

03:49.416 --> 03:50.875
Then Alfea happened.

03:51.875 --> 03:54.458
-We've got ten minutes.

03:57.541 --> 03:59.583
She's keeping the missing fairies
in the East Wing.

03:59.666 --> 04:00.583
Mm-hmm.

04:00.666 --> 04:03.416
We looked for a way in.
Rosalind has every entrance guarded.

04:03.500 --> 04:06.125
Those guards are gonna
have their hands full tonight.

04:06.708 --> 04:10.250
My fellow alums are quite the VIPs now.
They're gonna need protecting.

04:10.333 --> 04:12.583
You mean we break
into the East Wing tonight?

04:12.666 --> 04:14.208
During the banquet?

04:14.291 --> 04:16.125
Or whenever. No presh.

04:16.208 --> 04:18.208
What's a few more fairies without magic?

04:18.291 --> 04:20.458
Rosalind probably
won't go after one of you.

04:20.541 --> 04:22.458
And probably is good enough, right?

04:23.750 --> 04:24.916
I know it's risky,

04:25.000 --> 04:29.166
but after the vote tonight, it's gonna get
a whole lot harder to take Rosalind down.

04:29.250 --> 04:30.375
What vote?

04:30.458 --> 04:34.750
Queen Luna appoints the headmistress, but
officially the alums vote to swear her in.

04:34.833 --> 04:37.291
It's normally a formality, but…

04:37.375 --> 04:40.250
Rosalind hasn't seen
these people in 16 years.

04:40.333 --> 04:43.208
So she's gonna use tonight
to remind us all who she is.

04:43.916 --> 04:48.625
If it goes well, she's locked in
as headmistress. If it doesn't…

04:48.708 --> 04:51.333
I wonder what the most powerful people
in Solaria'd think

04:51.416 --> 04:54.500
if they found out Rosalind
is stealing magic from her students?

04:54.583 --> 04:55.916
You just need proof.

04:58.500 --> 05:00.208
Come on, we need to get back.

05:02.583 --> 05:03.541
Has he called?

05:04.250 --> 05:05.250
Silva?

05:06.041 --> 05:07.000
No.

05:07.666 --> 05:10.458
The less we know about where Saul is,
the safer he'll be.

05:10.541 --> 05:11.375
I know.

05:12.833 --> 05:17.083
I guess when Sky told me he asked him
to leave, I just didn't think he'd…

05:18.875 --> 05:19.833
go.

05:19.916 --> 05:24.208
Well, not-father and not-son
relationships are complicated.

05:34.833 --> 05:36.875
No prizes for finishing early.

05:36.958 --> 05:38.791
I get to leave. That's a prize.

05:43.916 --> 05:47.041
I assume you heard from Riven
what happened at Saul's house.

05:47.125 --> 05:48.208
You mean my house?

05:49.500 --> 05:50.750
Yeah, I heard.

05:53.625 --> 05:55.875
Tonight will be long
and tedious.

05:55.958 --> 05:59.500
Pompous alums who haven't done
a hard day's work in their lives.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.041
This usually helps me deal.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.625
-Riven!
-Take the afternoon.

06:06.708 --> 06:07.791
Adjust your attitude.

06:08.583 --> 06:09.791
His, too, by the way.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.500
You've both been
in a mood that's unpleasant.

06:21.458 --> 06:24.791
-There's a latch.
-Yeah, I know there's a latch.

06:24.875 --> 06:28.875
All this pent-up frustration, Riv.
I guess the rumors are true.

06:28.958 --> 06:31.250
That the three-way
was a little too much for you.

06:31.333 --> 06:33.166
It wasn't too much for me.

06:33.250 --> 06:34.541
It just ran its course.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.125
Anyone tell him that?

06:43.375 --> 06:45.000
You modelling that on me?

06:46.333 --> 06:47.583
-Not bad.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.750
Whoa. Are you growing a rainforest or…

06:50.833 --> 06:55.833
Oh dear, sorry.
My mind's in a million places.

06:58.000 --> 06:59.458
Philip, just go. Yeah.

06:59.541 --> 07:01.416
Seems different this week.

07:02.416 --> 07:05.416
It's difficult working under Rosalind
but usually he has a spark.

07:05.500 --> 07:07.208
-It's gone out.
-Because of Devin?

07:08.208 --> 07:10.291
-What I did?
-What Rosalind did.

07:11.041 --> 07:12.375
No, it's bigger than that.

07:12.458 --> 07:15.125
I overheard him on the phone
to someone from Malacoy.

07:15.208 --> 07:16.333
Malacoy Academy?

07:16.416 --> 07:21.041
They offered him a job a few years ago.
He said he'd never leave Alfea. But…

07:23.666 --> 07:25.958
I dunno. I don't know
what it'll mean for me and Sam.

07:26.625 --> 07:29.000
Special delivery. Don't worry, I'll help.

07:29.666 --> 07:31.625
We actually have help.

07:31.708 --> 07:34.083
Uh, yeah, you really don't need to.

07:35.875 --> 07:36.958
Hi.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.166
-This is your chair.
-Just need…

07:40.250 --> 07:42.666
-I can… I can move.
-I was going anyway.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.708
I can move. Oh.

07:48.750 --> 07:50.583
-I was going anyway. Um…
-Oh.

07:52.916 --> 07:53.750
Okay.

07:55.125 --> 07:56.625
I'll see you guys all later.

08:01.333 --> 08:03.666
That was, um… something.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.333
Proper painful.

08:05.416 --> 08:08.125
We were texting,
and now we're not texting, and just…

08:08.291 --> 08:10.458
Yeah, it's weird. Can we drop it?

08:23.041 --> 08:23.875
You okay?

08:24.458 --> 08:25.916
Hmm? Of course, yeah.

08:27.083 --> 08:30.125
I'm gonna head to my room.
Gotta shower and get ready.

08:30.208 --> 08:34.625
See if Grey's recovered
from whatever that was. See ya.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.333
Are you okay?

08:44.125 --> 08:45.208
Come here.

08:49.541 --> 08:52.291
So, remember how I was
taking Sam's anger away by magic?

08:52.375 --> 08:54.833
-Mm-hmm.
-I stopped 'cause of what you said.

08:54.916 --> 08:57.291
About being worried
it was all being bottled up.

08:57.375 --> 08:58.833
And he's all good, it seems.

08:58.916 --> 09:00.416
That's the problem. He's not.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.125
Just a second ago when he looked
at Rosalind, he was full of rage,

09:04.208 --> 09:06.500
but he smiled through it
and lied to my face.

09:08.791 --> 09:12.541
He's keeping something from me about her.
The sooner she's gone, the better.

09:13.791 --> 09:15.916
So, tonight is split into two events.

09:16.625 --> 09:19.291
The mixer where the alums
and the students chat,

09:19.375 --> 09:22.666
and then the banquet itself,
which is just alums and VIPs.

09:23.458 --> 09:25.708
Mm. Let me guess, you're a VIP?

09:27.125 --> 09:30.666
My mum's not coming this year,
but, uh, my uncle is.

09:30.750 --> 09:33.250
I have a lot
to talk to him about, but, um,

09:34.375 --> 09:36.500
I'll work him during dinner
whilst you get proof.

09:36.583 --> 09:37.500
Can we trust him?

09:37.583 --> 09:40.208
Yeah, he sees people
for who they truly are.

09:40.291 --> 09:44.500
And he is not afraid to say it. There is
no love lost between him and Rosalind.

09:44.583 --> 09:47.708
Well, at least somebody sees her
for who she really is.

10:19.375 --> 10:22.125
The guests are arriving.
Everything is ready.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.125
I suppose we should get going.

10:29.666 --> 10:31.541
The guards know what to do.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.166
Time for dinner and a show.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.875
I think that's Duke Hammerström.

10:55.958 --> 10:57.083
Duke Hammer-who?

10:57.166 --> 10:58.125
Hammerström.

10:58.208 --> 11:01.666
He's like, um… like a Solarian Jeff Bezos.

11:01.750 --> 11:05.666
He perfected thought-based purchasing.
You think it, you buy it. A nightmare.

11:05.750 --> 11:10.708
Duke Oscar Hammerström,
Mind Fairy, graduated '82.

11:10.791 --> 11:12.958
Now has a monopoly on Otherworld products.

11:13.041 --> 11:17.208
-Whoa, you made note cards for the alums?
-Mm-hmm. They're conversation starters.

11:17.291 --> 11:19.541
I'm not sure
that's how conversations work.

11:19.625 --> 11:22.333
Ah, Aimee Leroy, so nice to meet you.

11:22.416 --> 11:24.250
Just the other day I was making tea,

11:24.333 --> 11:28.458
and it reminded me of your breakthrough
theory on elemental fluid mechanics.

11:29.333 --> 11:31.083
-Yeah, they're not all winners.

11:31.166 --> 11:34.208
But we have a few hours of mingling
before we storm the East Wing.

11:34.291 --> 11:38.333
I'm gonna hang with you and make sure
we temper whatever nuggets are on here.

11:38.416 --> 11:39.250
It's cute.

11:39.333 --> 11:43.250
So, is everyone who went to Alfea
like Duke Hammerstrong?

11:44.125 --> 11:47.458
Are there no normal jobs
in the Otherworld? No accountants or--

11:47.541 --> 11:51.125
Of course there are.
It's just most of them didn't go to Alfea.

11:51.208 --> 11:55.583
I mean, the reason why all the alums
are so powerful is because

11:56.625 --> 11:58.125
this school is the best.

11:59.166 --> 12:01.416
Think I found the best way
into the East Wing.

12:01.500 --> 12:06.083
And don't freak out, but I do think
it's easiest if I just go by myself.

12:06.166 --> 12:07.083
-No way.
-What?

12:07.166 --> 12:08.291
It's fine, I'm…

12:08.375 --> 12:11.541
Plus, if… if I get caught,
I can worm my way out with Rosalind.

12:11.625 --> 12:15.000
-Um… yeah, hold that thought.

12:18.458 --> 12:19.666
May I help you?

12:20.291 --> 12:23.625
Nicked this from Rosalind's office.
Fancy a quick pre-drinks drink?

12:23.708 --> 12:28.208
I'm… I'm kinda busy right now,
but… I'm sure Riven's free.

12:28.291 --> 12:30.791
Ah, much to discuss. We're not…

12:30.875 --> 12:33.500
I may have ratted him out
to gain Rosalind's trust,

12:33.583 --> 12:35.208
which failed miserably and…

12:35.791 --> 12:37.666
-I--
-I'm really sorry, Beatrix.

12:38.833 --> 12:41.500
-I just don't have time right now.

12:52.208 --> 12:56.250
Ooh… Aah. It is a nice bottle of champers.

12:56.333 --> 12:58.708
Nice enough to make up
for burning my house down?

12:58.791 --> 13:01.916
Ah, your house
wasn't that great anyway.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.750
Mm… At least you got
to get a bit of use out of your old bed.

13:06.750 --> 13:09.291
I'm surprised it wasn't in flames
when I got there.

13:09.375 --> 13:11.833
What happened?
Couldn't find her pilot light?

13:11.916 --> 13:14.416
Curious, bud.
Do you think that's funny?

13:14.500 --> 13:15.666
Mm.

13:17.083 --> 13:18.041
I'm just jealous.

13:18.666 --> 13:22.708
Last time I got screwed was by Beatrix
and Rosalind, and not in a good way.

13:24.791 --> 13:26.916
You still don't… remember anything?

13:27.000 --> 13:31.041
No. Only thing I remember is being
served up on a platter by my girlfriend

13:31.125 --> 13:33.333
and Rosalind mind fucking me.

13:36.208 --> 13:37.541
What did Rosalind want?

13:39.750 --> 13:40.625
No idea.

13:40.708 --> 13:41.750
It's all a blur.

13:43.125 --> 13:44.791
Doesn't matter.

13:44.875 --> 13:49.291
Only thing that matters is me realizing
how much of a bitch Bea was.

13:49.375 --> 13:50.333
Mm-hmm.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Happy it's over.

13:54.708 --> 13:55.541
Come in.

14:00.333 --> 14:01.750
I'm gonna hop in the shower.

14:08.666 --> 14:11.625
-What the fuck's going on?
-Well, that's a great question.

14:11.708 --> 14:14.666
But I'm gonna need you
to be a tad more specific.

14:14.750 --> 14:17.625
Something's up between you and Beatrix,
but she won't tell me.

14:17.708 --> 14:20.291
Beatrix being cagey. Shocker.

14:26.708 --> 14:27.541
It's over.

14:30.583 --> 14:33.416
Jesus, I didn't realize
I had to report everything to you.

14:36.416 --> 14:37.375
What about us?

14:39.458 --> 14:41.791
Whatever happened,
it shouldn't change what we--

14:41.875 --> 14:44.000
There is no "we," Dane.

14:45.083 --> 14:46.375
There is no "us."

14:47.750 --> 14:49.500
I thought we were clear about that.

14:54.000 --> 14:54.958
Look,

14:56.041 --> 14:59.375
I'm sorry, okay, but…

15:01.416 --> 15:02.625
it's not about you.

15:04.625 --> 15:05.666
It never was.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.041
Those about the alums?

15:27.541 --> 15:32.333
Yeah, helps me organize my thoughts.
I know it's cringe.

15:32.416 --> 15:34.583
Aisha does the same thing.

15:36.416 --> 15:37.416
Hmm.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.958
Look, I wouldn't say this if I literally
couldn't feel people's emotions,

15:41.041 --> 15:42.833
but Aisha is 100% into you.

15:43.708 --> 15:44.708
Don't give up.

15:51.541 --> 15:52.791
Sam will be out in a sec.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.250
Hm.

16:25.500 --> 16:26.708
The hell are you doing?

16:27.458 --> 16:30.416
-Sam, I was just--
-Looking through my shit. Right.

16:32.333 --> 16:35.416
Why do you have Eldwyn Amalgam
in your bag? And a syringe?

16:35.500 --> 16:39.041
-I was just cataloging stuff for my dad.
-Sam, stop lying, it's me.

16:48.666 --> 16:50.000
Rosalind is a problem.

16:51.583 --> 16:53.166
Somebody has to do something.

16:53.250 --> 16:56.916
-We are. We're gonna expose her--
-That's not enough. It's not good enough!

16:57.000 --> 16:59.583
-I know you're angry.
-No, she is ruining my family.

16:59.666 --> 17:01.625
My dad is a shell of himself,
thinking of leaving--

17:01.708 --> 17:04.500
-Okay, but let's just talk about this.
-No, no, no.

17:04.583 --> 17:06.375
No more talk. No, she has to pay.

17:08.166 --> 17:10.208
Sam, I've been taking your anger.

17:12.375 --> 17:14.333
For… for weeks. With my magic.

17:15.708 --> 17:18.750
Every time you got angry with Rosalind,
I took it away.

17:20.125 --> 17:23.958
Every time I took it, I didn't realize,
but it builds and it builds.

17:25.208 --> 17:28.791
-I didn't know. And--
-You've been messing with my head?

17:29.291 --> 17:30.958
I just wanted you to be happy.

17:31.041 --> 17:33.458
You've been messing with my head
and you didn't tell me.

17:34.541 --> 17:35.541
I'm so sorry.

17:36.958 --> 17:40.291
But this is a mistake that I've made.
You can see that.

17:42.250 --> 17:43.375
This isn't you.

17:44.875 --> 17:46.166
You're not a killer.

17:49.291 --> 17:53.458
-Sam. Sam--
-Don't fucking touch me.

18:24.333 --> 18:26.750
I assume the guards will clear out
once the banquet starts.

18:26.833 --> 18:29.333
If not, maybe one of you
can form a distraction.

18:29.416 --> 18:32.666
-Don't you all look lovely?
-Big night.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.000
Bigger than you know.

18:34.875 --> 18:36.083
Walk with me.

18:38.458 --> 18:41.375
-That doesn't seem good.
-Yeah, neither does this.

18:41.875 --> 18:45.166
I'm choosing to exist in the positive.
Keep me posted.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.250
Uncle Arthur!

18:47.791 --> 18:49.833
-Stella! Oh!

18:49.916 --> 18:54.750
So, just the two of us, shall we try
some real human conversations?

18:54.833 --> 18:55.916
I'm not a robot.

18:56.666 --> 18:59.791
Don't tell anyone,
but I absolutely loathe these things.

19:00.291 --> 19:02.541
-Reed, nice to see you!
-Thank you.

19:03.833 --> 19:06.708
Money and status. Status and money.

19:07.333 --> 19:10.458
-What a dreadful existence.
-Hm.

19:11.625 --> 19:14.375
But… you need them to vote you in.

19:15.416 --> 19:17.000
I do. I do.

19:18.375 --> 19:22.666
Which is why I'd like you with me
by my side today.

19:22.750 --> 19:26.500
There's a… a seat
next to me at the banquet.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.083
I thought only VIPs
were invited to the banquet.

19:29.166 --> 19:32.125
You're the first fairy
to transform in generations.

19:33.125 --> 19:35.166
How much more IP can you get?

19:35.750 --> 19:38.875
-And I'm here to prop you up.
-She catches on quick.

19:38.958 --> 19:41.458
And what happens
if I don't feel like being used?

19:45.041 --> 19:49.166
That is Field Marshal Bavani Selvarajah,

19:49.666 --> 19:51.791
Commanding Officer of the Solarian Army.

19:52.291 --> 19:55.333
I wonder what she'd say
if she knew that you and your friends

19:55.416 --> 19:57.875
attacked her caravan
and broke out Saul Silva?

19:59.291 --> 20:00.916
I think she might be angry.

20:01.916 --> 20:03.125
Shall we find out?

20:04.000 --> 20:05.208
Field Marshal.

20:06.083 --> 20:08.791
Rosalind. And who do we have here?

20:10.083 --> 20:11.791
This is my star pupil.

20:11.875 --> 20:14.791
The fairy who transformed. Bloom.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.833
It's very nice to meet you.

20:18.416 --> 20:20.500
How are you so comfortable right now?

20:21.291 --> 20:22.458
Mm. Practice.

20:23.208 --> 20:24.458
When we were in Linphea,

20:24.541 --> 20:27.625
I got dragged to a lot
of fundraiser things with my parents.

20:27.708 --> 20:30.916
Just remember that all these adults
were our age at one point.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.625
Aimee Leroy. Her, I have to talk to her.

20:36.708 --> 20:37.791
Of course.

20:37.875 --> 20:39.375
Thanks. Bye.

20:43.541 --> 20:44.458
Is that…

20:44.541 --> 20:47.000
A notecard. On Aimee Leroy.

20:47.083 --> 20:49.583
-Oh! Marry him!
-We need to talk.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.541
-Over here. Come on.
-Yeah.

20:53.541 --> 20:55.041
Then out of nowhere,

20:55.125 --> 20:58.416
Rosalind just…
just attaches it to my back.

20:59.041 --> 21:02.875
-I know I'm not perfect, but--
-The tracking gem is a bit much.

21:02.958 --> 21:05.000
-Yes.
-Everyone back home agrees.

21:05.083 --> 21:08.666
Thank you. I mean, my mum thinks
I'm some sort of delinquent.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.750
I know who you are. Don't worry.

21:10.833 --> 21:12.958
Think you can talk her into taking it out?

21:13.041 --> 21:15.541
You know you get a pristine report
from me, love.

21:15.625 --> 21:18.708
But Rosalind's the one
who's got your mother's ear these days.

21:18.791 --> 21:20.000
What if she was gone?

21:20.666 --> 21:25.000
Can't imagine you like someone outside
the family having quite so much influence.

21:25.083 --> 21:25.958
Hmm.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.125
Whatever my feelings are about that,

21:30.791 --> 21:33.375
I certainly wouldn't be so foolish
as to air them publicly.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.291
-Champagne, sir?
-Thank you. Too kind.

21:37.791 --> 21:40.708
-Now, where is that suitemate of yours?
-Hmm.

21:41.875 --> 21:43.708
-Which one?
-Stella!

21:43.791 --> 21:45.500
There's only one.

21:46.041 --> 21:47.583
The fairy who transformed.

21:47.666 --> 21:48.583
Yes. Bloom.

21:49.833 --> 21:51.708
Of course you're interested in Bloom.

21:52.208 --> 21:54.416
When the Burned Ones attacked,
I knew what to do.

21:54.500 --> 21:55.833
Earlier in the evening

21:55.916 --> 21:59.833
Rosalind had been working with me
at the Stone Circle to tap into my magic.

22:00.625 --> 22:03.291
I recall many similar days
training with you.

22:03.791 --> 22:04.708
It paid off.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.833
Richard has been Mayor of Blackbridge
for decades now.

22:09.541 --> 22:11.708
-Universally loved.

22:16.791 --> 22:19.250
-How's your wife?
-Fine, thank you.

22:19.333 --> 22:21.375
I've sent her 20 texts.

22:22.125 --> 22:23.375
She's not responding.

22:25.125 --> 22:26.833
She hasn't left Rosalind's side.

22:26.916 --> 22:29.833
She isn't going to. She's seated
next to Rosalind at the banquet.

22:29.916 --> 22:31.916
-She can't go to the East Wing.
-No.

22:32.000 --> 22:35.583
But it's not the end of the world
as long as somebody else does.

22:37.041 --> 22:39.666
-Looks like we're up.
-Are you sure we shouldn't wait?

22:39.750 --> 22:41.833
You have to move quickly.
Bloom is powerful.

22:41.916 --> 22:43.416
If Rosalind accesses that power,

22:43.500 --> 22:46.166
she could vaporize the entire room
or control minds--

22:46.250 --> 22:48.958
Got it. Rosalind plus Bloom
equals bad news.

22:50.250 --> 22:51.083
Yeah.

23:01.583 --> 23:03.875
Turn it off or I'll fry it.

23:07.916 --> 23:09.833
-Sam wants to kill her?
-Now he does.

23:09.916 --> 23:13.500
-Obviously, that's not him talking.
-And you've no idea where he went?

23:14.250 --> 23:16.291
He hasn't been answering my texts.

23:16.375 --> 23:19.583
-But maybe I can take his anger away--
-Have you learned nothing?

23:19.666 --> 23:22.333
When I saw you do that to Aisha,
I warned it was a bad idea.

23:22.416 --> 23:25.750
And you've kept doing it.
To my brother. And now he's on the…

23:27.583 --> 23:31.041
…brink of becoming a murderer
and you wanna do it again? Smart.

23:31.916 --> 23:34.416
Let's find him before he does
something he can't take back.

23:53.875 --> 23:55.958
So I'm relegated
to the commoners.

23:56.541 --> 23:58.500
I assumed you didn't want to come.

23:58.583 --> 24:01.458
I don't. But if somebody's going
to sit with you, it should be me

24:01.541 --> 24:03.708
Not the Otherworld's
blandest water biscuit.

24:03.791 --> 24:06.000
-Un-fucking-believable.
-Don't make a scene.

24:06.875 --> 24:08.041
Right.

24:08.958 --> 24:12.458
Wouldn't want to ruin Rosalind's
mysterious plan for the evening, would I?

24:17.541 --> 24:18.958
-What?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.750
-We're leaving.
-Excuse me?

24:23.833 --> 24:26.708
-This is dumb. We're leaving.
-I'm talking with my friends.

24:26.791 --> 24:27.791
About what?

24:27.875 --> 24:29.625
Your macros? Your best deadlift?

24:29.708 --> 24:31.958
How to avoid
accidentally picking up a book?

24:35.000 --> 24:37.375
I used to think
there was more to you than this.

24:37.458 --> 24:40.916
The bravado was a disguise
for a scared little girl, but really

24:41.000 --> 24:42.625
you're just a nasty piece of work.

24:42.708 --> 24:45.500
And the sad thing is you think
people are scared of you.

24:45.583 --> 24:46.791
They're not.

24:46.875 --> 24:49.083
-They just don't like you.

24:52.041 --> 24:54.000
Sorry about that. Where were we?

24:54.541 --> 24:56.750
Uses the opportunity
to sweep my leg.

24:59.708 --> 25:01.333
You can be mean to me.

25:02.166 --> 25:04.125
You can flirt with the dumb boys.

25:04.708 --> 25:06.500
You can do literally anything.

25:08.500 --> 25:10.458
He will never love you.

25:12.083 --> 25:13.083
Know that.

25:24.541 --> 25:27.333
Let's go. The East Wing is this way.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.208
I thought you might like company.

25:59.291 --> 26:00.916
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:03.541 --> 26:05.583
Thought you were off
doing secret agent shit.

26:05.666 --> 26:07.500
Me too.

26:08.583 --> 26:10.291
Rosalind has other ideas.

26:12.416 --> 26:13.750
Aisha and Flora are on it,

26:13.833 --> 26:16.833
so I have to make sure
Rosalind doesn't try anything else. What?

26:19.083 --> 26:19.916
What?

26:20.416 --> 26:22.500
You… you just look…

26:25.083 --> 26:26.708
Can't believe you're my girlfriend.

26:30.958 --> 26:32.458
…also feel terrible.

26:32.541 --> 26:33.375
Hmm.

26:34.208 --> 26:35.416
What are you doing here?

26:35.500 --> 26:36.875
Rosalind invited me.

26:36.958 --> 26:39.666
Oh, thank God.
Someone with something to say.

26:40.666 --> 26:42.166
I want to hear it all.

26:42.250 --> 26:44.083
Now I wonder why this is empty?

26:48.041 --> 26:48.916
Thank you.

26:52.875 --> 26:55.708
Of course he's confused. His girlfriend's
been playing with his mind.

26:55.791 --> 26:57.208
That's not what I meant.

26:58.708 --> 27:00.916
Sorry, mate. Give me two. Custom cocktail.

27:01.458 --> 27:03.291
<i>I think I got through to him.</i>

27:03.375 --> 27:05.541
Sam's not a killer, and he knows it.

27:06.875 --> 27:10.416
<i>I hope you're right. If someone</i>
<i>finds out what he's been planning…</i>

27:12.250 --> 27:14.041
Come with me. Now.

27:19.541 --> 27:20.375
That way.

27:30.208 --> 27:32.333
-Sure this is the right way?
-I think so.

27:42.833 --> 27:44.708
8

27:58.875 --> 28:02.125
-Do you know Sebastian?
-I've seen him in town.

28:02.208 --> 28:03.958
Such a disappointment.

28:04.541 --> 28:07.416
Andreas tried to make
a decent Specialist out of him, but…

28:07.500 --> 28:08.916
Blood from a stone.

28:09.000 --> 28:13.291
Andreas, one of these days,
you must come to the Capitol

28:13.375 --> 28:16.333
and let Stella's old etiquette teacher
give you a lesson.

28:16.416 --> 28:18.625
Cute little <i>My Fair Lady </i>moment.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.791
At least Sky was lucky enough
to be raised by Saul,

28:23.875 --> 28:26.958
although talk about
the blind leading the blind.

28:27.041 --> 28:31.083
-Uncle Arthur!
-Oh, come on. Now, you know it's true.

28:31.166 --> 28:35.333
I mean, no fault to you, but if you
and my niece had stayed together…

28:35.416 --> 28:37.708
…scandal!

28:38.291 --> 28:41.166
Granted, you seem
to have landed on your feet.

28:41.916 --> 28:44.416
Landed the fairy who transformed.

28:44.500 --> 28:46.125
Well done.

28:46.958 --> 28:50.166
-I didn't land anything.
-Maybe some water.

28:50.250 --> 28:52.708
Oh, no, don't… don't be that girl.

28:56.333 --> 28:59.333
-If you'll excuse me a moment.
-Mm-mm-mm-mm.

28:59.916 --> 29:01.166
A little more of the other.

29:14.083 --> 29:15.083
Rosalind.

29:15.833 --> 29:19.291
Sorry, um, things were just…
they were getting heated at the table.

29:20.833 --> 29:24.875
-Thank you.
-Maybe just, um, tone it down a bit.

29:25.500 --> 29:29.416
-Everybody's so delicate.
-No, you were just being a royal dick.

29:31.208 --> 29:32.291
What did you say to me?

29:32.375 --> 29:34.958
Oh, I'm sorry.
Would you like me to say it louder?

29:38.458 --> 29:42.416
You realize
you are nothing. Yes?

29:42.500 --> 29:43.875
Less than nothing.

29:43.958 --> 29:47.041
I have household cleaning staff
who are more important than you.

29:47.125 --> 29:48.750
Uh, don't talk to him like that.

29:48.833 --> 29:51.875
You cannot come here
and disrespect my friends.

29:52.541 --> 29:55.250
Every comment out of your mouth
has been a thinly,

29:55.750 --> 29:57.541
or not so thinly, veiled insult.

29:57.625 --> 29:58.958
-And you're drunk.

29:59.041 --> 30:00.916
Yes, I'm being that girl.

30:01.708 --> 30:03.166
Go get some water.

30:09.166 --> 30:10.666
Your mum was right.

30:11.916 --> 30:12.875
You've changed.

30:13.458 --> 30:16.750
What a shame.
You really wanted that gem out too.

30:24.458 --> 30:27.500
He's an absolute prick, but I need him.

30:29.166 --> 30:30.041
For the vote?

30:30.791 --> 30:31.791
And other things.

30:33.958 --> 30:35.333
Why are you so cryptic?

30:36.583 --> 30:37.958
Just can't figure you out.

30:39.708 --> 30:43.125
You threaten me and my friends
then invite my boyfriend to sit with me.

30:44.541 --> 30:46.708
You act like we're rivals
one second, then--

30:46.791 --> 30:49.458
You think I'm some sort
of evil mastermind, don't you?

30:51.958 --> 30:53.708
It's my fault, I suppose.

30:54.541 --> 30:56.333
It is a persona I cultivate.

30:58.166 --> 31:00.375
First, I'll level with you.

31:00.958 --> 31:04.666
I would never turn you
and your friends in. I'd lose your trust.

31:05.708 --> 31:08.291
And do you know
how bad it would make me look?

31:08.375 --> 31:11.666
This room is full of people
who want to see me fail.

31:12.708 --> 31:17.541
I'm cryptic because every move I make
has to be bulletproof or they will pounce.

31:19.041 --> 31:20.125
They all love you.

31:20.208 --> 31:24.500
Nobody really loves the powerful ones.
You'll learn that soon enough.

31:25.625 --> 31:28.208
Luckily, fear works too.

31:28.791 --> 31:30.333
Cryptic again.

31:30.416 --> 31:31.916
Yeah, you have a knack for it.

31:32.000 --> 31:33.458
I have to have a little fun.

31:34.916 --> 31:38.500
Sorry, I have been bullshitting a lot.

31:39.875 --> 31:42.208
But there's one thing
you need to know is true.

31:43.125 --> 31:44.833
You are my star pupil, Bloom.

31:46.166 --> 31:50.875
Transforming, taking down the Burned Ones,
that's just the beginning of your story.

31:50.958 --> 31:53.666
A story I'm lucky to witness.

31:54.416 --> 31:57.833
You will shape the Otherworld
more than any of these fairies

31:58.458 --> 32:00.916
and, truthfully, more than your friends.

32:02.041 --> 32:03.041
It won't be easy.

32:04.375 --> 32:05.916
I'm on your side.

32:10.791 --> 32:13.041
Now, if you'll excuse me,

32:14.333 --> 32:16.625
I have cryptic business to attend to.

32:29.375 --> 32:31.125
Did we already come this way?

32:31.208 --> 32:33.458
Unclear. Every hallway looks the same.

32:34.208 --> 32:35.333
Terrifying.

32:37.041 --> 32:38.083
What was that?

32:41.541 --> 32:43.500
Right, yes, of course.

32:46.416 --> 32:48.583
You're not gonna respond?
You're killing me.

32:48.666 --> 32:51.125
My life is like a pie chart.
I only have so much room--

32:51.208 --> 32:53.041
No, we're not doing this again.

32:54.166 --> 32:57.916
Do not use your goals as an excuse.
This is deeper than that.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.375
Look, I don't like
to do things I'm not good at,

33:00.458 --> 33:03.500
and I'm not good at this stuff.

33:03.583 --> 33:04.875
What stuff?

33:09.750 --> 33:11.208
I've never been with a guy.

33:11.291 --> 33:13.916
Like, at all. Ever.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.375
And, I know some things
just happen naturally,

33:16.458 --> 33:17.958
but what if they don't?

33:18.708 --> 33:21.583
What if I make sacrifices
for something I'm gonna fail at?

33:22.083 --> 33:25.083
Or worse, something
that's gonna end up hurting me.

33:26.291 --> 33:29.416
Hey, you want to protect yourself,
I totally get that.

33:30.583 --> 33:34.333
But trust me, falling for someone
is not something to protect yourself from.

33:34.833 --> 33:38.333
Aisha, we are designed to fall in love.

33:38.416 --> 33:42.416
Our bodies release hormones
when our gut bacteria is compatible.

33:42.958 --> 33:44.208
How crazy is that?

33:44.291 --> 33:47.000
And yet we still resist. Why?

33:48.166 --> 33:52.416
To avoid getting hurt.
To maintain some illusion of control.

33:54.041 --> 33:55.583
Losing control is the best part.

33:57.333 --> 33:59.083
And, yes, it'll probably end.

33:59.875 --> 34:02.708
When it does,
it could be the worst feeling ever.

34:03.208 --> 34:04.375
But that's life too.

34:04.875 --> 34:06.125
Don't push life away.

34:09.875 --> 34:11.000
I think we're here.

34:29.958 --> 34:31.958
This must be the lab, but…

34:39.833 --> 34:44.000
-Can you smell something?

34:53.208 --> 34:55.041
Alcohol. It's been sterilized.

35:05.625 --> 35:07.791
I'm gonna close that just in case.

35:16.041 --> 35:18.750
We need evidence.
An empty lab is not proof.

35:18.833 --> 35:20.500
-And--

35:21.916 --> 35:23.625
-Did you hear that?

35:28.250 --> 35:29.666
Hang on, let me.

35:42.458 --> 35:44.916
Maybe there's something wrong
with the plug?

35:50.958 --> 35:52.083
Got it.

35:52.166 --> 35:53.041
Aisha!

35:57.833 --> 35:59.083
That way!

36:00.583 --> 36:01.875
Got it!

36:07.458 --> 36:10.750
Stop. Stop channeling.
I don't think your magic works.

36:12.125 --> 36:14.166
-Where is it?
-I don't know.

36:14.250 --> 36:16.208
-Over there.

36:44.708 --> 36:46.541
Help me!

36:48.500 --> 36:50.166
Magic might not work.

36:50.250 --> 36:51.458
How about chemistry?

36:57.500 --> 37:00.250
-That's it?
-Yeah, we've got it.

37:00.333 --> 37:01.833
It looks like a pile of goo.

37:02.333 --> 37:05.666
We have a video of Rosalind's
literal dungeon in the East Wing.

37:06.416 --> 37:08.083
Plus photos of that book.

37:08.166 --> 37:10.916
And Flora, Terra, and I
saw what she did to Devin.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.500
I don't know if that's enough.
Maybe we need more proof.

37:13.583 --> 37:17.375
We can't wait. We won't have this many
influential people together again.

37:17.458 --> 37:18.541
What if we're wrong?

37:21.416 --> 37:23.458
Rosalind knows that we broke Silva out.

37:24.583 --> 37:27.083
-We have to take her down.
-No, she hasn't told anyone.

37:27.166 --> 37:29.041
She said she's not going to, and I…

37:30.166 --> 37:32.416
I know that I shouldn't, but I… I do,

37:32.500 --> 37:34.291
I… I… I believe her.

37:37.208 --> 37:40.000
-It's complicated.
-Hm. It's actually pretty simple.

37:40.916 --> 37:42.166
Cliché even.

37:42.250 --> 37:46.250
An outsider all your life. Get a taste
of the inner circle and can't get enough.

37:47.833 --> 37:51.708
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-I know exactly what. I lived it.

37:51.791 --> 37:54.125
You seem to forget that this was my life.

37:54.208 --> 37:56.583
Your 15 minutes
are gonna get people killed.

37:56.666 --> 37:59.750
-If you won't do the right thing, I will.

37:59.833 --> 38:02.125
…stays in the right hands.

38:02.208 --> 38:05.458
Hands powerful enough
to contain its unbroken might.

38:06.916 --> 38:09.291
So, what do you say
we get this vote over with

38:09.375 --> 38:12.125
so that we can all keep drinking?

38:17.541 --> 38:19.791
Rosalind is not who she seems.

38:24.666 --> 38:26.875
I was trying to help him, Terra!

38:26.958 --> 38:30.416
-Please don't be angry at me.
-People need to feel things, Musa.

38:31.291 --> 38:32.708
I can't help how I feel.

38:39.541 --> 38:40.541
Is that Sam?

38:48.458 --> 38:50.250
-Is he…
-He'll be fine, love.

38:51.458 --> 38:53.208
You two should talk.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.750
Remember when we met?

39:06.875 --> 39:07.958
Of course.

39:08.041 --> 39:10.500
You said I sounded
like the absence of chaos.

39:12.083 --> 39:14.416
A lot to throw on someone you've just met.

39:14.500 --> 39:17.458
Enya was easier to stomach.
But I got what you meant.

39:19.583 --> 39:23.208
I don't know when things changed,
but my life's now full of chaos.

39:27.666 --> 39:28.958
All of our lives are.

39:32.041 --> 39:34.583
I know why you wanted
to take some of that chaos away.

39:34.666 --> 39:36.250
I'm not mad at you for that.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.833
Of course, I'm not a killer.

39:41.333 --> 39:43.125
But I'm not okay, Musa.

39:43.750 --> 39:45.416
Not because of what you did.

39:47.208 --> 39:48.208
What is it?

39:53.583 --> 39:54.875
I'm leaving Alfea.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.583
No, no. Sam, this is just temporary.
You're just confused.

40:03.666 --> 40:05.791
Except you can feel how I feel.

40:06.958 --> 40:08.083
I'm not confused.

40:08.791 --> 40:09.875
Not anymore.

40:09.958 --> 40:12.833
-We can fix this. How can we fix this?
-Musa.

40:13.416 --> 40:19.541
You, us… it's been the only good thing
in my life for a while.

40:21.333 --> 40:22.541
But it's not enough.

40:30.291 --> 40:32.083
So, you're just giving up?

40:32.166 --> 40:35.833
Marco agreed to keep what happened
between us, as long as I got Sam help.

40:35.916 --> 40:37.041
So get Sam help, and--

40:37.125 --> 40:39.166
You know I can't
keep teaching here. And-

40:39.250 --> 40:40.875
Don't take me away from school.

40:42.291 --> 40:46.125
-Don't take me away from my friends.
-As though I could if I wanted to.

40:47.541 --> 40:48.541
You belong here.

40:49.541 --> 40:51.166
But Sam and I must go.

40:54.458 --> 40:56.000
What if we take Rosalind down?

40:56.791 --> 40:58.083
It's a nice thought.

40:58.791 --> 41:01.208
But she's… she's trickier than you think.

41:04.000 --> 41:06.083
After torturing him in her lab,

41:06.166 --> 41:08.208
after stealing his magic,

41:08.916 --> 41:11.416
Rosalind let that student die
in her office.

41:13.166 --> 41:14.500
Devin deserved better.

41:16.166 --> 41:17.666
Solaria deserves better.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.750
I hate to break protocol,

41:22.833 --> 41:25.708
but there may be
a few minor inconsistencies

41:25.791 --> 41:27.166
with her Highness's theory.

41:27.833 --> 41:28.875
Devin!

41:30.250 --> 41:34.833
About a month ago,
my friend Mayor Quinn called me.

41:34.916 --> 41:39.083
Two fairies, recently released
from their studies at Alfea,

41:39.166 --> 41:40.583
went missing in Blackbridge.

41:40.666 --> 41:44.125
They were found days later, catatonic.

41:44.208 --> 41:46.500
Bitten. I offered my help.

41:46.583 --> 41:49.791
But until we found answers,
he swore me to secrecy.

41:49.875 --> 41:51.458
He didn't want to cause panic.

41:52.375 --> 41:54.500
I have to admit, I was stumped

41:54.583 --> 41:58.791
until I borrowed a text
from the Royal Archives,

41:58.875 --> 42:00.375
with Arthur's permission.

42:00.458 --> 42:04.541
In it, I found an ancient creature
called a scraper,

42:05.583 --> 42:08.208
a native of The Realm of Darkness.

42:08.291 --> 42:09.541
It feeds on magic.

42:09.625 --> 42:14.083
I realized that's what had happened
to those poor fairies.

42:21.083 --> 42:25.208
I've been studying a scraper
here at the school since we captured it.

42:25.958 --> 42:28.041
It wasn't until Devin was found

42:28.125 --> 42:30.083
that I got the answers I needed.

42:30.166 --> 42:32.375
I was able to bring him back
from near death.

42:32.458 --> 42:34.750
All thanks to Benjamin Harvey's daughter,

42:34.833 --> 42:39.708
who discovered an amalgam
that was able to revive all three fairies.

42:39.791 --> 42:42.791
I probed their minds
and the picture became clear.

42:43.666 --> 42:47.333
The scrapers were being called upon
by a Blood Witch.

42:48.916 --> 42:53.291
Our old foes
have discovered how to steal our magic.

42:54.875 --> 42:57.750
If Blood Witches continue using scrapers,

42:58.791 --> 42:59.708
fairy magic,

43:00.375 --> 43:01.458
therefore fairies,

43:02.166 --> 43:03.375
will cease to exist.

43:05.458 --> 43:11.875
Clearly, despite my efforts
to keep my investigation secret,

43:13.625 --> 43:16.125
some of you sensed danger and took action.

43:17.125 --> 43:20.666
Your courage will be needed
in the coming days,

43:22.125 --> 43:23.958
as we face our real enemy.

43:25.250 --> 43:27.041
Thank you for joining us here.

43:27.916 --> 43:30.500
Students, for now, you are dismissed.

43:39.958 --> 43:41.208
Except for you, Bloom.

43:47.500 --> 43:50.708
-Stella, are you okay?
-I'm fine. I just need a moment.

43:57.583 --> 43:59.750
He wasn't dead. I didn't kill him.

43:59.833 --> 44:02.833
We were wrong.
I was so sure we were right.

44:02.916 --> 44:03.958
But we were wrong.

44:04.916 --> 44:07.041
Wonder what else you could be wrong about.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.291
Go.

44:14.833 --> 44:16.125
Wow.

44:16.208 --> 44:18.166
A genuine fairy godmother.

44:18.875 --> 44:20.625
You know, that…

44:20.708 --> 44:23.000
…that deserves a drink.

44:23.083 --> 44:25.458
You led with fairy godmother.
I'm not rewarding that.

44:25.541 --> 44:27.541
What? My godmother's hot as fuck.

44:28.125 --> 44:31.708
Does this normally work for you?
Bad boy with a heart of gold.

44:31.791 --> 44:33.041
I dunno, you tell me.

44:33.875 --> 44:35.375
-Is it working?
-No.

44:36.166 --> 44:38.833
But I did just find out
I'm not a murderer so…

44:39.333 --> 44:43.125
Lucky for you "not a murderer" is exactly
what I'm looking for these days.

44:43.791 --> 44:45.291
Oh my God.

44:45.375 --> 44:49.166
Leroy was great, you know.
Hammerström was…

44:49.250 --> 44:51.708
I avoided. Too drunk.

44:52.208 --> 44:53.041
Smart.

44:53.708 --> 44:57.083
He was literally just talking at me
for, like, 45 minutes.

44:57.166 --> 44:59.458
I'm sure I could list
all the drinks I smelt on his breath.

45:01.708 --> 45:02.708
Oh…

45:06.916 --> 45:08.750
Might be able to squeeze in a swim.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.625
Mm. Gotta keep that schedule, I guess.

45:12.708 --> 45:15.791
It's been a rough day for me.
Need to clear my mind.

45:15.875 --> 45:16.833
Mm-hmm.

45:19.125 --> 45:20.958
So, see you at the river in ten?

45:21.541 --> 45:23.750
Or do you need 15
so you can do some sit-ups?

45:26.125 --> 45:28.416
And I'd go with the new Speedo.

45:33.666 --> 45:34.583
Hm.

45:38.791 --> 45:43.250
We will find the Blood Witches
who did this and eliminate them.

45:43.333 --> 45:44.791
What resources do you need?

45:44.875 --> 45:49.166
For the moment, I have everything I need
right here at the school.

45:51.291 --> 45:53.666
I wanted you to meet Bloom for a reason.

45:55.250 --> 45:57.250
Not only is she a powerful young fairy,

45:57.750 --> 46:00.375
but inside of her
burns the magic of legend.

46:02.416 --> 46:03.541
The Dragon Flame.

46:04.125 --> 46:05.833
-[gasping
-The Dragon Flame!

46:12.666 --> 46:17.291
Which means that Bloom
is the key to saving our world.

48:02.666 --> 48:04.500
I know. It's a lot.

48:07.583 --> 48:10.541
When we first spoke at the Stone Circle,
you said the Blood Witches

48:10.625 --> 48:13.250
were the ones who kidnapped me
and held me at Aster Dell.

48:15.250 --> 48:17.291
Is that because of this thing inside me?

48:19.208 --> 48:20.583
The Dragon Flame.

48:21.583 --> 48:22.583
It is.

48:27.083 --> 48:30.250
What about my birth parents?
Do they have it, too, or are they--

48:30.333 --> 48:32.958
I… I wasn't lying back then.

48:35.208 --> 48:37.000
I don't know where you came from.

48:38.625 --> 48:40.250
But the Blood Witches will.

48:41.666 --> 48:44.416
We'll fight them and we'll work it out.

48:46.125 --> 48:48.958
You've kept so much from me.
I don't know if I can trust you.

48:50.083 --> 48:52.041
Maybe this will help.

48:56.166 --> 48:58.250
-What is this?
-It's a pardon.

48:59.958 --> 49:00.791
Silva.

49:02.791 --> 49:05.875
I've been working Arthur
for a week for that damn thing.

49:06.375 --> 49:09.500
Stella almost fucked it up
this afternoon, but…

49:09.583 --> 49:10.708
I don't understand.

49:12.041 --> 49:14.791
-Why are you--
-It's time to put aside our differences.

49:15.625 --> 49:17.333
We have a common enemy.

49:18.000 --> 49:20.666
The Blood Witches
are a scourge on the Otherworld.

49:20.750 --> 49:24.250
Every time we drive them out,
they come crawling back.

49:25.250 --> 49:28.750
She's right. And if they are
gathering strength to make a move,

49:28.833 --> 49:31.541
we need to stop them before it's too late.

50:04.083 --> 50:07.458
Whoever you are, you can leave
a fucking girl in bloody peace.
