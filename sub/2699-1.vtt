WEBVTT

01:05.498 --> 01:08.158
What have you got there?

01:10.294 --> 01:11.703
God!

01:13.881 --> 01:15.624
Baxter?

02:08.394 --> 02:11.221
He got our dog!

02:11.647 --> 02:15.684
He got Baxter!

02:25.036 --> 02:27.154
Shut up, Norman.

02:29.455 --> 02:33.051
Can this happen to a normal woman?

02:42.636 --> 02:45.297
Baxter's fertilizer.

02:45.723 --> 02:49.837
And everyone's just
standing there like...

02:50.338 --> 02:52.238
staring.

02:52.897 --> 02:56.641
Why don't they just
catch that thing?

02:59.695 --> 03:03.239
How hard could it be in a
place full of dead ends?

03:03.240 --> 03:04.891
Fuck!

03:05.368 --> 03:08.153
Wrists are for girls...

03:08.704 --> 03:11.239
I'm slitting my throat.

03:13.042 --> 03:14.667
You should definitely hang.

03:14.668 --> 03:17.670
Maybe even your final moment
is a clichÃ© around here.

03:17.671 --> 03:21.166
Not ours. B, ours will rock.

03:21.175 --> 03:25.136
You don't think our deaths should be a
little more than cheap entertainment?

03:25.137 --> 03:29.849
You jazzed me on this.
Don't wuss out now.

03:29.850 --> 03:34.596
It's the idea of everyone
staring at me just lying there.

03:34.897 --> 03:38.858
I mean, what if they just... laugh?

03:38.859 --> 03:41.236
They'll be in awe.

03:41.237 --> 03:45.615
B, suicide is like the
ultimate "fuck you".

03:45.616 --> 03:49.486
Come on it's so us. It's the pact.

03:50.162 --> 03:53.081
See, it's easy for you.
You don't care.

03:53.082 --> 03:56.042
We swore we'd go together,
one way or another.

03:56.043 --> 03:59.913
- When we were eight.
- So?

04:00.297 --> 04:05.418
Out by sixteen or dead in this
scene, but together forever.

04:11.600 --> 04:13.802
Together forever.

04:16.856 --> 04:20.100
United against life as we know it.

04:20.233 --> 04:23.728
Us dead will be the
shit, B. Trust me.

04:37.293 --> 04:39.286
Too much blood.

04:39.503 --> 04:44.249
- And I can see your gonch!
- Just do it.

07:09.131 --> 07:12.331
All right, all right... uh.

07:13.532 --> 07:16.242
Well that was completely...

07:16.243 --> 07:18.820
..disturbing, wasn't it?

07:18.912 --> 07:23.157
You know, the Fitzgerald
sisters clearly worked very...

07:23.792 --> 07:25.376
God!

07:25.377 --> 07:27.044
I mean I, I...

07:27.045 --> 07:29.831
I am completely sickened.

07:30.549 --> 07:34.836
Sickened... by that, wasn't I?

07:37.139 --> 07:41.467
Look, see me in the guidance office,
after class, you two, separately.

07:41.852 --> 07:44.979
Can we see the ones
of Ginger again?

07:44.980 --> 07:46.230
Enough!

07:46.231 --> 07:47.557
Hey!

07:48.734 --> 07:51.603
Life in Bailey Downs, huh?

07:51.653 --> 07:53.396
Who's next?

08:03.582 --> 08:08.202
Oh yes, ladies, run. Run for daddy!

08:09.171 --> 08:11.331
Bounce.

08:14.551 --> 08:16.093
I bet she's good to go.

08:16.094 --> 08:18.679
- You wanna do a Fitzgerald?
- You're kidding?

08:18.680 --> 08:22.183
Not the little dweeb, you goinks.
The one with the rack!

08:22.184 --> 08:23.926
The redhead.

08:24.186 --> 08:25.595
Odd.

08:25.812 --> 08:29.057
I think McCardy just checked me.

08:33.986 --> 08:36.688
Like you care, right?

08:37.198 --> 08:40.576
High school is just a mindless
little breeders machine.

08:40.577 --> 08:43.446
A total hormonal toilet.

08:44.081 --> 08:47.116
I'd rather wait it
all out in our room.

08:47.501 --> 08:51.545
- What is with your back?
- I don't know.

08:51.546 --> 08:55.333
Hey, 'Search and Destroy'. Go.

08:59.846 --> 09:02.840
OK, Trina Sinclair.

09:04.976 --> 09:09.222
Excellent selection. Continue.

09:09.606 --> 09:12.650
Trina Sinclair, D.O.A.
at the hair dye aisle.

09:12.651 --> 09:16.904
Perished while seeking matching barrettes
on nothing but diet pills and laxatives.

09:16.905 --> 09:19.240
Likes her shorts stuck
up her ass crack.

09:19.241 --> 09:22.326
Favorite homework excuse:
my nail glitter ate it.

09:22.327 --> 09:24.370
Basic pleasure model.

09:24.371 --> 09:29.826
Your standard,
cumbuckety date bait.

09:31.086 --> 09:32.870
Good one.

09:33.463 --> 09:36.833
- Line change. Let's go, girls.
- Fucking Bitch!

09:38.009 --> 09:39.309
Uh oh.

09:45.308 --> 09:47.885
Let's do this again.

09:50.272 --> 09:52.014
I'll cover you.

09:52.441 --> 09:54.725
Good.

10:00.949 --> 10:04.618
Bounce, babies,
bounce! Keep running.

10:04.619 --> 10:06.579
You want it baby.

10:06.580 --> 10:07.705
C'mon, honey!

10:07.706 --> 10:09.448
Oh yeah, baby!

10:10.625 --> 10:13.953
- You want it, baby.
- Fuck off!

10:19.092 --> 10:21.510
'The Beast of Bailey
Downs' strikes again.

10:21.511 --> 10:23.304
That's four dogs this week.

10:23.305 --> 10:25.848
Oh! Wow... Bonus!

10:25.849 --> 10:29.143
I guess you're D.O.A.
on a dog. Huh, Fitz-face?

10:29.144 --> 10:31.220
That's enough.

10:31.521 --> 10:34.190
- Are you OK?
- Terrific.

10:34.191 --> 10:37.067
That is one mother-fucking mad dog.

10:37.068 --> 10:39.812
Brigitte, go get cleaned up.

10:41.698 --> 10:44.408
Don't ever touch my sister again.

10:44.409 --> 10:47.194
Stop me, freak.

10:49.080 --> 10:51.991
Enough! Break it up!

11:06.806 --> 11:10.392
Hey, that janitor was looking
right down your shirt.

11:10.393 --> 11:11.719
Sure.

11:12.228 --> 11:14.897
Want me to kill her?
I'll kill her for you, B.

11:14.898 --> 11:16.557
Whatever.

11:16.858 --> 11:21.862
No, not whatever.
This isn't whatever.

11:21.863 --> 11:25.032
Seriously, what about torture?

11:25.033 --> 11:27.526
Anything you want.

11:29.204 --> 11:32.957
Or... she has that dog.

11:32.958 --> 11:38.337
We could kidnap it, make it look like he
got eaten by 'The Beast of Bailey Downs'.

11:38.338 --> 11:41.298
We got all that blood and fake
guts from the slide show.

11:41.299 --> 11:44.460
Yeah, that's wicked. Let's do it.

11:50.100 --> 11:54.887
She screws a drug dealer; she's
begging for negative attention.

11:55.271 --> 11:57.731
So, Sam are you...
are you gonna call me?

11:57.732 --> 11:59.483
OK, you have my number, right?

11:59.484 --> 12:03.312
Remember when I gave
it to you, before?

12:03.363 --> 12:04.980
Sam.

12:05.115 --> 12:06.857
OK, bye...

12:07.117 --> 12:09.235
Let's get up.

12:11.287 --> 12:13.539
Such a dickhead.

12:13.540 --> 12:14.498
See...

12:14.499 --> 12:17.793
You'd let idiots get away
with fucking you up.

12:17.794 --> 12:19.586
That's why the big Buddha made me.

12:19.587 --> 12:21.547
To stop them.

12:21.548 --> 12:23.507
Yeah, so far you're
really kicking ass.

12:23.508 --> 12:27.636
Just give me one clean shot.
Just one, I fucking promise you.

12:27.637 --> 12:31.590
- Don't humor me!
- So, Fitz...

12:31.975 --> 12:34.385
I think we should get together.

12:40.275 --> 12:41.684
No.

12:46.322 --> 12:48.149
Bitch!

12:50.994 --> 12:53.112
Jump, Norman. Come on.

12:54.914 --> 12:56.081
B...

12:56.082 --> 12:58.417
Just say you won't
go average on me.

12:58.418 --> 13:01.003
Just 'cause some gonad
gets his zipper going?

13:01.004 --> 13:02.963
Rather be dead.

13:02.964 --> 13:08.760
- I'd rather die than be here without you.
- Relax, you're not, you big suck.

13:08.761 --> 13:12.047
Ginger, don't push your sister.

13:13.057 --> 13:16.093
God, I hate our gene pool.

13:17.061 --> 13:18.804
Look, girls.

13:21.191 --> 13:24.560
Come on. Let go. Let go.
You're ruining it!

13:33.077 --> 13:36.447
Ginger, why are you
rubbing your back?

13:36.873 --> 13:40.250
- It hurts.
- Why?

13:40.251 --> 13:46.590
Well, pain flows up your nerve endings
to the synapses in your brain...

13:46.591 --> 13:48.675
She's not funny.

13:48.676 --> 13:52.922
- How did you hurt it?
- Being dead.

13:53.973 --> 13:57.351
Does it hurt down by your tail
bone, or is it up higher?

13:57.352 --> 14:01.230
- Is it tight throughout here?
- Maybe.

14:01.231 --> 14:04.058
Does it ache back here?

14:04.442 --> 14:07.937
- Might...
- Oh my god.

14:10.156 --> 14:12.366
Do you think it's cramps?

14:12.367 --> 14:15.410
Give it a rest... for two seconds?

14:15.411 --> 14:17.037
Pam, we're eating.

14:17.038 --> 14:20.207
Henry, the girls are both three
years late menstruating. OK?

14:20.208 --> 14:22.125
It's not normal. If it's
finally happening...

14:22.126 --> 14:23.335
It's not!

14:23.336 --> 14:27.506
Honey, it's nothing to be scared of.
It's the most normal thing in the world.

14:27.507 --> 14:29.967
- Maybe it's cancer of the spine.
- Ginger-Ann...

14:29.968 --> 14:32.753
Or tuberculosis.

14:32.762 --> 14:35.639
- See what your attitude does?
- Or spondylitis.

14:35.640 --> 14:39.184
- Spondo... what?
- Fuses your vertebrae together.

14:39.185 --> 14:41.061
- Nice.
- Brigitte, stop it.

14:41.062 --> 14:42.104
Have a fit!

14:42.105 --> 14:43.939
I've had just about
enough of that tone.

14:43.940 --> 14:47.693
- That makes two of us. Fuck!
- That's it. To your room!

14:47.694 --> 14:49.436
Gladly.

14:51.614 --> 14:55.776
Brigitte, you are not
connected at her wrist.

14:56.661 --> 14:59.871
Your father and I have counseling tonight.
I don't want you leaving the house.

14:59.872 --> 15:03.291
The news says there's still
some wild animal on the loose.

15:03.292 --> 15:05.293
They never go out.

15:05.294 --> 15:08.130
Well, you're a big help.

15:08.131 --> 15:10.165
As usual.

15:13.344 --> 15:15.587
- Ginger.
- What?

15:15.972 --> 15:19.675
- We'll get caught.
- No, we won't.

15:20.059 --> 15:24.271
- The dog won't even be out.
- He has to pee some time.

15:24.272 --> 15:26.690
People don't leave their
dogs out alone anymore.

15:26.691 --> 15:28.150
Then you will just
have to distract her

15:28.151 --> 15:31.445
while I nab the pooch
and make with the gore.

15:31.446 --> 15:33.622
I can't distract her.

15:33.748 --> 15:40.020
The fuck, B. This is your idea. If you
don't like your ideas, stop having them.

15:45.752 --> 15:46.793
Sorry.

15:46.794 --> 15:50.664
I've just just had it with
eating all this shit, OK?

15:53.926 --> 15:56.170
Check it out.

15:58.723 --> 16:02.184
Now we can even leave
a body. She'll freak.

16:02.185 --> 16:03.927
Oh, wicked.

16:05.104 --> 16:07.439
Take his...

16:07.440 --> 16:09.725
leg?

16:17.366 --> 16:20.027
He's still warm.

16:28.002 --> 16:29.878
Oh, gross.

16:29.879 --> 16:31.338
Shit!

16:31.339 --> 16:34.958
Leave it then. The drag.

16:36.177 --> 16:39.046
You got some on you.

16:39.263 --> 16:41.215
Nice.

16:46.270 --> 16:47.804
What?

16:48.147 --> 16:50.849
B,

16:51.484 --> 16:54.152
I just got the curse.

16:54.153 --> 16:55.654
Eww.

16:55.655 --> 16:58.698
Well, it's not contagious!

16:58.699 --> 17:00.992
I know that.

17:00.993 --> 17:02.402
God!

17:02.703 --> 17:06.580
I mean, kill yourself to be different
and your own body screws you.

17:06.582 --> 17:09.166
But if I start simping
around tampon dispensers

17:09.167 --> 17:13.329
and moaning about
PMS, shoot me, OK?

17:28.646 --> 17:31.264
Let's get out of here.

17:42.868 --> 17:45.028
Ginger?

17:45.871 --> 17:48.156
Ginger!

17:52.044 --> 17:54.413
Ginger?

17:55.798 --> 17:57.541
Ginger!

18:01.095 --> 18:03.171
Ginger!

18:26.454 --> 18:30.699
Oh God. He's right behind me.

18:39.884 --> 18:41.835
Oh, my God!

18:50.436 --> 18:52.596
Ginger!

18:53.981 --> 18:55.724
Ginger!

19:02.531 --> 19:05.108
Ginger!

19:31.227 --> 19:33.887
Get up. Come on, get up!

20:03.092 --> 20:05.377
Oh, fuck me.

20:16.563 --> 20:18.306
Shit!

20:26.448 --> 20:28.191
Mom!

20:29.660 --> 20:32.487
Dad! Help!

20:33.664 --> 20:34.872
Let me see.

20:34.873 --> 20:39.752
- No, it hurts, it burns...
- I have to see it, Ginger.

20:39.753 --> 20:44.257
- What was it? What was it?
- I don't know. A big dog, maybe.

20:44.258 --> 20:47.385
That's not...
What did I do? What...

20:47.386 --> 20:48.511
Shh.

20:48.512 --> 20:50.972
I saw this thing once, on bears.

20:50.973 --> 20:56.144
Said a bear will like, come after a
girl on the rag, because of the smell.

20:56.145 --> 20:57.937
It wasn't a fucking bear!

20:57.938 --> 21:01.891
There wasn't any fucking
bears anywhere near here.

21:04.862 --> 21:07.731
- Does that hurt?
- No.

21:09.992 --> 21:14.829
That's impossible.
They're already healing.

21:14.830 --> 21:16.914
No, this isn't right.
I'm calling 911.

21:16.915 --> 21:18.124
No! No!

21:18.125 --> 21:21.252
B, I'm not bleeding anymore. Right?

21:21.253 --> 21:23.421
I mean... just...

21:23.422 --> 21:25.548
spare me Pam finding out.

21:25.549 --> 21:30.044
OK? I'm OK. OK?

21:30.888 --> 21:34.632
- OK.
- I'm OK.

21:36.560 --> 21:40.472
- I thought you were gonna die.
- I'm OK.

22:20.979 --> 22:23.898
Preying upon normal healthy cells,

22:23.899 --> 22:28.986
the intruder gradually devours
the host from within.

22:28.987 --> 22:33.574
Eventually the invader
consumes its host completely,

22:33.575 --> 22:37.820
and finally destroys it.

22:39.665 --> 22:44.252
Complete meiosis involves two
successive division sequences,

22:44.253 --> 22:50.333
which result in four new cells,
each of which is haploid.

23:02.646 --> 23:05.974
This one comes with
a free calendar.

23:09.695 --> 23:13.189
Are you sure it's just cramps?

23:13.574 --> 23:16.117
Just so you know...

23:16.118 --> 23:21.197
the words 'just' and 'cramps',
they don't go together.

23:30.340 --> 23:32.174
OK, you're really girling out here.

23:32.175 --> 23:35.469
One day, you too will know my pain.

23:35.470 --> 23:40.182
Hey, diss me or whatever,
but I got three sisters...

23:40.183 --> 23:44.137
and nothing quite takes the
edge off like a good toke.

23:44.521 --> 23:50.101
Well, maybe I like my edge, thanks.

23:50.319 --> 23:54.564
Or maybe you're just
chickened to lose it.

24:09.338 --> 24:12.290
Just pass it, fag.

24:18.347 --> 24:20.840
- That a girl.
- Yeah.

24:30.817 --> 24:33.561
An eighth's fifty.

24:34.696 --> 24:39.192
- I don't want any drugs.
- Then amscray.

24:43.455 --> 24:46.699
I was just wondering what you hit.

24:49.252 --> 24:54.248
Well, officer, it looked like
a lycanthrope to me, sir.

24:54.633 --> 24:58.586
- I know what a lycanthrope is.
- Sure you do.

25:00.138 --> 25:03.591
Think you see werewolves a lot?

25:08.313 --> 25:10.431
Why, do you?

25:14.611 --> 25:16.813
Is it working?

25:17.197 --> 25:21.526
No... but now I just don't care.

25:28.291 --> 25:31.369
- What the hell are you guys doing in here?
- Sam, the Man.

25:31.545 --> 25:33.921
Sam, man, we just needed
a place to come and smoke.

25:33.922 --> 25:36.257
Hey, you know, I have an idea.

25:36.258 --> 25:40.803
Why don't you guys get the
fuck out of my van, assholes!

25:40.804 --> 25:44.465
No, I'm serious. Get out!
Get out. Get out!

25:45.809 --> 25:51.230
- Samuel, what happened to your truck?
- I tapped a tree, all right. Good bye.

25:51.231 --> 25:52.439
Ginge, let's go.

25:52.440 --> 25:54.775
Yeah, why don't you stick to
your own species Fitzenstein?

25:54.776 --> 25:57.395
Trina, stick my fist.

26:09.833 --> 26:13.869
Oh you bitch! It's OK, baby.

26:21.303 --> 26:24.297
Ginge, what's going on?

26:25.682 --> 26:27.683
Something's wrong.

26:27.684 --> 26:29.927
Like more than you being just...

26:29.978 --> 26:31.929
female.

26:32.731 --> 26:35.766
Can you just say something, please?

26:47.162 --> 26:48.454
Wow!

26:48.455 --> 26:52.458
'Wow'? That's it? 'Wow'?

26:52.459 --> 26:56.537
I can't have a hairy
chest, B. That's fucked!

26:57.547 --> 26:59.332
No way.

27:01.259 --> 27:05.087
The fuck? What the fuck?

27:05.096 --> 27:07.056
- This isn't...
- What?

27:07.057 --> 27:09.717
- No way, like...
- What?

27:10.518 --> 27:15.514
Bitten on a full moon.
Now you're hairy?

27:18.693 --> 27:21.312
I know, but think about it.

27:21.696 --> 27:26.650
Well thank you for taking my total
fucking nightmare so seriously!

27:36.711 --> 27:38.454
Oh shit!

27:39.881 --> 27:42.500
What if I'm dying or something?

27:46.388 --> 27:49.215
We gotta see the nurse.

27:49.307 --> 27:53.977
I'm sure it seems like a lot
of blood. It's a period.

27:53.978 --> 27:58.107
But really it was like a...

27:58.108 --> 27:59.817
geyser.

27:59.818 --> 28:02.694
Everyone seems to panic
their first time.

28:02.695 --> 28:05.656
Neither of you have had a period
before and you're how old?

28:05.657 --> 28:09.493
I'm almost 16, she just turned 15.
She skipped a grade.

28:09.494 --> 28:15.082
A thick, syrupy, voluminous
discharge is not uncommon.

28:15.083 --> 28:19.711
The bulk of the uterine lining is
shed within the first few days.

28:19.712 --> 28:24.258
Contractions, cramps,
squeeze it out like a pump.

28:24.259 --> 28:27.845
In three to five days you'll find
lighter, bright-red bleeding.

28:27.846 --> 28:34.426
That may turn to a brownish or blackish
sludge, which signals the end of the flow.

28:35.520 --> 28:38.897
- OK, so it's all normal?
- Very!

28:38.898 --> 28:45.229
Expect it every twenty eight days,
give or take, for the next thirty years.

28:45.613 --> 28:48.323
Great. Thanks.

28:48.324 --> 28:53.203
What about hair that wasn't
there before, and pain?

28:53.204 --> 28:56.532
Mhm, comes with the territory.

28:57.625 --> 29:00.294
Thank you. Let's go, B.

29:00.295 --> 29:06.049
Wait, you'll have to protect against
both pregnancy and STDs now...

29:06.050 --> 29:07.793
Play safe!

29:41.544 --> 29:45.122
Wish this where babies' legs.

29:45.173 --> 29:48.717
Ginger's very favorite.

29:48.718 --> 29:53.513
Congratulations sweetie. You
know you can ask me anything.

29:53.514 --> 29:55.766
You're so dead.

29:55.767 --> 29:57.059
I didn't.

29:57.060 --> 30:00.554
Our little girl's a
young woman now.

30:06.486 --> 30:09.905
- I'd never tell her anything.
- Unless you wanted to piss me off!

30:09.906 --> 30:16.286
- I want you to be OK.
- I am! I just got my period, OK?

30:16.287 --> 30:21.124
Now, I've got weird hairs, so what?
That means I've got hormones,

30:21.125 --> 30:24.294
and they may make me butt-ugly,
but they do not make me a monster.

30:24.295 --> 30:26.213
So you got bit by a
great big hormone.

30:26.214 --> 30:28.590
Well not by what you
think. They don't exist!

30:28.591 --> 30:31.051
Norman, shut the fuck up!

30:31.052 --> 30:32.552
Maybe he's barking at you.

30:32.553 --> 30:34.638
Did I change last night?

30:34.639 --> 30:37.641
Howl at the moon, kill shit
and change back this morning?

30:37.642 --> 30:38.642
Huh? No!

30:38.643 --> 30:40.977
Did it take a silver bullet
to stop that thing? No!

30:40.978 --> 30:43.438
It got killed by a fucking truck.

30:43.439 --> 30:45.941
You always blow off
anything you don't get.

30:45.942 --> 30:48.485
Yeah, when it's bullshit!

30:48.486 --> 30:54.358
You're doing drugs with guys. Something
is definitely wrong with you.

30:54.909 --> 30:58.036
You know, maybe you're right.
Maybe I do see a monster.

30:58.037 --> 31:01.331
Yeah, it's got these
little green eyes.

31:01.332 --> 31:03.875
Oh yeah, like I really wish I
was hemorrhaging and hairy,

31:03.876 --> 31:05.293
and sucking off Jason McCardy.

31:05.294 --> 31:09.381
- Well you always wanted to be me!
- Well this isn't you, so.

31:09.382 --> 31:10.549
Oh, poor B.

31:10.550 --> 31:14.261
I'm growing up and
obviously you're not, huh?

31:14.262 --> 31:17.923
- Well don't let me hold you back or anything.
- Oh, well, don't worry, I won't.

31:47.170 --> 31:50.380
Only one creature on earth
destroys for pure pleasure.

31:50.381 --> 31:52.332
It's a werewolf.

31:55.386 --> 31:57.846
Oh my god, there it is.

31:57.847 --> 31:59.673
It's hideous!

32:16.949 --> 32:22.571
Get the fuck outta the bathroom!
I'm trying to get ready!

32:29.587 --> 32:31.747
Ginger? Oh my god.

32:46.896 --> 32:48.972
Oh babe...

32:49.315 --> 32:50.849
Check it out.

33:32.900 --> 33:35.685
Hello, hello, hello...

33:43.119 --> 33:44.528
Hey!

33:46.831 --> 33:48.915
Kid, you got a smoke?

33:48.916 --> 33:50.367
No.

33:52.878 --> 33:54.871
You got a light then?

33:57.675 --> 33:58.425
Oh, thank you.

33:58.426 --> 34:02.879
I just spent a week of my life
looking for you. Give me a sec.

34:08.143 --> 34:12.472
You dropped this - in my truck.

34:13.565 --> 34:17.811
OK, we both saw it.
What the fuck was it?

34:18.027 --> 34:21.447
- It's what you hit.
- Hmm! I know,

34:21.449 --> 34:24.568
but what the fuck was it?

34:26.161 --> 34:29.496
See, I flattened an animal. Furry,
all-fours, could be anything.

34:29.498 --> 34:33.743
But here I am,
thinking 'lycanthrope'.

34:34.587 --> 34:36.788
That's crazy, huh?

34:37.172 --> 34:41.668
Book me into the rubber motel,
I'm officially all fucked up, right?

34:42.136 --> 34:44.295
What if you're not?

34:46.306 --> 34:50.435
Well, that would explain the
human circumcised dick,

34:50.436 --> 34:53.972
and why you were running
for your life from it.

34:54.356 --> 34:58.351
I have to go. Thanks for my stuff.

35:01.155 --> 35:03.356
What's your name?

35:55.292 --> 35:58.628
- Bullshit.
- Thanks.

35:58.629 --> 36:00.914
No, hey, bullshit?

36:02.841 --> 36:05.259
What do you say?

36:05.260 --> 36:08.338
Swear you won't call a freak show.

36:09.848 --> 36:11.883
Yeah, I swear.

36:13.560 --> 36:19.057
I'm changing, like right now and full
moons have nothing to do with it.

36:19.441 --> 36:21.401
You're serious?

36:21.402 --> 36:23.528
And everything I look
at goes silver bullet,

36:23.529 --> 36:28.274
in a gun, to my head, the end.

36:29.535 --> 36:30.944
Wow.

36:32.371 --> 36:35.657
Let's not panic here. I mean...

36:36.041 --> 36:41.838
for one, that thing on the road,
my van did a pretty good job on it,

36:41.839 --> 36:47.836
without the benefit of silver bullets.
So, let's just forget the Hollywood rules.

36:48.262 --> 36:49.887
There's got to be a cure, right?

36:49.888 --> 36:53.675
Otherwise, there would be a
hell of a lot more of them.

36:54.268 --> 36:59.605
It's like an infection, it works from
the inside out. It's like a virus.

36:59.606 --> 37:05.278
Biology, there's something you
can sink your teeth into.

37:05.279 --> 37:07.605
So to speak.

37:07.781 --> 37:12.660
You're real, your problem's
real, the solution's real.

37:12.661 --> 37:17.532
Not bam, death by morality call.

37:17.916 --> 37:20.626
Then again when I started
piercing shit, I got infections,

37:20.627 --> 37:24.038
girl says try pure silver,
cleared up like that.

37:28.802 --> 37:33.473
The ancients thought pure
metals purified their blood.

37:33.474 --> 37:38.511
- They thought leeches did, too.
- They do.

37:42.024 --> 37:46.360
Hey, why don't you get your
slut-bitch sister a leash?

37:46.361 --> 37:47.737
What a freak.

37:47.738 --> 37:50.023
Nice bird necklace.

37:51.783 --> 37:54.986
Ginger, a word?

37:57.289 --> 38:00.909
- Is it sorry?
- No.

38:03.795 --> 38:05.755
Come on Jason, let's go.

38:05.756 --> 38:07.498
Oh yes.

38:07.841 --> 38:09.918
Ginger!

38:10.219 --> 38:11.619
Ginger!

38:14.223 --> 38:17.717
Hey. She's ovulating!

38:28.654 --> 38:32.523
See you, freak. Bye bye.

38:33.951 --> 38:40.039
This is a very exciting,
confusing time for your sister.

38:40.040 --> 38:44.460
Boys, her body, trying to fit in.

38:44.461 --> 38:46.796
Maybe if she felt that she
could share more with you,

38:46.797 --> 38:49.624
you'd both be a lot happier.

38:50.467 --> 38:56.714
You know, Brigitte, your
turn's coming, too... one day

39:08.694 --> 39:10.603
My stomach.

39:12.364 --> 39:16.067
Hey, take it easy, all right?
We've got all night.

39:16.451 --> 39:20.730
Sorry, you just taste really good.

39:21.331 --> 39:25.079
Just lie back and relax.

39:25.605 --> 39:28.504
You lie back and relax!

39:28.505 --> 39:31.165
Who's the guy here?

39:32.175 --> 39:36.053
Who's the guy here? Huh?
Who's the fucking guy here?

39:36.054 --> 39:38.548
Don't we need protection here?

39:39.266 --> 39:40.717
Stop it!

39:41.768 --> 39:43.185
Wait a second!

39:43.186 --> 39:46.597
You're fucking hilarious, cave boy.

40:07.377 --> 40:09.203
Ginge?

40:10.213 --> 40:12.248
What happened?

40:14.426 --> 40:17.003
Did he hurt you?

40:19.514 --> 40:22.600
If he hurt you, you should tell.

40:28.356 --> 40:30.308
Oh, my god!

40:33.236 --> 40:36.280
- Get out! Get out!
- What happened?

40:36.281 --> 40:40.568
Something is really,
really wrong with me, B.

40:43.497 --> 40:45.706
What happened?

40:45.707 --> 40:49.168
I get this ache and...

40:49.169 --> 40:56.459
I thought it was for sex, but it's to
tear everything into fucking pieces.

41:00.305 --> 41:02.298
Where is he?

41:07.938 --> 41:09.680
Next door.

41:24.287 --> 41:26.238
Oh, my god!

41:27.207 --> 41:29.659
You killed Norman.

41:30.502 --> 41:36.958
He barked and he barked and he
kept fucking barking, and...

41:39.928 --> 41:42.380
I just... I just...

41:42.472 --> 41:45.341
I couldn't stop myself.

41:46.518 --> 41:50.888
B, what am I supposed to do?

41:54.943 --> 41:58.145
It wasn't at all like I
thought it would be.

42:00.448 --> 42:06.278
There was just all this
squirming and squealing.

42:06.788 --> 42:12.118
And than he's done,
and you're like 'Oh?'

42:14.087 --> 42:18.833
Just probably out there telling
everyone what a freak I am.

42:20.552 --> 42:23.887
We'll say the same thing about him.

42:23.888 --> 42:30.219
It doesn't work like that.
I mean, he got laid.

42:30.437 --> 42:32.187
I'm just a lay.

42:32.188 --> 42:36.851
He's a hero and IÂm just a
lay, a freaked mutant lay.

42:37.277 --> 42:40.271
Did you use something?

42:40.530 --> 42:42.273
No.

42:51.207 --> 42:53.250
You really think this will work?

42:53.251 --> 42:56.162
We have to try something.

42:59.132 --> 43:02.051
Where did you get that, that ring?

43:02.052 --> 43:03.878
I found it.

43:05.638 --> 43:07.214
Too bad.

43:08.183 --> 43:14.722
You should have one too. I mean,
for being with me on this.

43:19.194 --> 43:20.978
Ready?

43:22.447 --> 43:24.315
Yeah.

43:36.628 --> 43:38.871
Shit, it's stuck!

43:41.674 --> 43:43.626
Hold still.

43:45.220 --> 43:48.005
- Fuck! Hurry up!
- Sorry, sorry.

43:48.556 --> 43:50.799
It's almost there.

43:57.023 --> 43:59.266
How do you feel?

44:04.113 --> 44:05.981
Wicked.

44:12.872 --> 44:14.740
Norman?

44:17.001 --> 44:19.036
Hey, Norman.

44:37.939 --> 44:39.690
Hurry up!

44:39.691 --> 44:44.395
- Hold still.
- I am, hurry up.

45:04.382 --> 45:06.667
Come on, hit it, baby.

45:13.182 --> 45:20.681
- Oh, McCardy what happened to you?
- Ginger Fitzgerald rocked my world.

45:21.649 --> 45:24.810
What, did you get your rag, too?

45:25.486 --> 45:27.229
Oh, shit!

45:27.697 --> 45:30.274
It must be ink, all right? Fuck!

45:39.584 --> 45:41.326
Hi!

45:42.170 --> 45:44.246
Brigitte!

45:46.466 --> 45:48.751
Brigitte, come here.

45:49.093 --> 45:51.928
What the fuck, B? Did you get
a boyfriend or something?

45:51.929 --> 45:54.723
No, we just...

45:54.724 --> 45:57.217
I'll be right back.

46:02.231 --> 46:04.441
Oh my god.

46:04.442 --> 46:08.361
Hey, what's up? Look, if silver's shot,
I've been reading and I got another idea.

46:08.362 --> 46:13.650
Are you on drugs, like right now?
I'm in class here.

46:15.703 --> 46:19.281
Yeah, excuse me for giving a shit.

46:20.541 --> 46:24.495
- I'll come see you later, OK?
- Whatever.

46:30.426 --> 46:33.879
The Fitzen sister are
really getting around.

46:36.474 --> 46:40.602
- OK, line change. Let's go.
- He thinks I got bit.

46:40.603 --> 46:44.272
I trust you, and you blabbed to the
first fuck-up who comes along.

46:44.273 --> 46:46.900
He knows stuff, he wants to help.

46:46.901 --> 46:50.938
He wants to get down
your pants, stupid!

46:51.322 --> 46:56.193
So, sluts run in the family...
quel shocker!

47:16.848 --> 47:19.758
- Knock it off!
- Ginger, no!

47:20.184 --> 47:22.394
Ginger, no! Stop!

47:22.395 --> 47:25.180
Fight, fight, fight...

47:28.651 --> 47:33.313
- You started it.
- Ginger, to the office.

47:39.912 --> 47:42.831
This school has a 'zero
tolerance for violence'-policy.

47:42.832 --> 47:44.291
I mean a temper like
that is inexcusable

47:44.292 --> 47:48.120
barring substantial
extenuating circumstances.

48:16.407 --> 48:22.671
What are you looking at? Huh?
My pen exploded, OK. My red pen.

48:23.456 --> 48:24.517
That was fucking incredible.

48:24.518 --> 48:28.335
Get your camera, don't you have a
camera? This is wall-worthy. Come on.

48:28.336 --> 48:34.750
You gave it to Jason. You had
unprotected sex, and you infected him.

48:35.801 --> 48:37.210
Oops!

48:39.180 --> 48:45.635
- I have to see Sam. He's got an idea.
- I bet he does. Well, let's go.

48:46.020 --> 48:48.563
If you come, you can't
be weird, Ginger.

48:48.564 --> 48:51.691
If he gets I lied. If he gets that
you're really the one who's really...

48:51.692 --> 48:55.070
a what? ...A monster? Huh, a freak?

48:55.071 --> 48:59.649
If he thinks I dicked him
around, he'll blow this off.

49:00.951 --> 49:03.403
I'll behave.

49:07.208 --> 49:11.536
Romeo, Romeo, wherefore
art thou Romeo?

49:13.037 --> 49:16.216
- Hey.
- Hey.

49:16.217 --> 49:20.303
Sorry about before. I was just afraid
someone would hear us, that's all.

49:20.304 --> 49:23.765
Yeah, she is just a
little moody lately.

49:23.766 --> 49:27.519
That whole silver thing didn't
quite work out, did it?

49:27.520 --> 49:30.772
I wasn't expecting company.

49:30.773 --> 49:34.559
My sister, Ginger. She knows.

49:34.944 --> 49:40.106
If you two come in here, you see
sweet fuck all. Understood?

49:46.705 --> 49:48.448
Jesus!

49:49.959 --> 49:52.460
Wicked! Smoke us up!

49:52.461 --> 49:55.747
Yeah, wicked huh? Get the fuck out!

49:57.383 --> 50:00.385
All right, Brigitte,
it brakes down like this.

50:00.386 --> 50:01.970
I compared

50:01.971 --> 50:06.224
homeopathic treatments of infections
to the folklore of all this. Take a look.

50:06.225 --> 50:09.060
Aconitum di lycotonum.

50:09.061 --> 50:11.771
- 'Lyco' as in wolf?
- Right.

50:11.772 --> 50:12.939
It's called Monkshood.

50:12.940 --> 50:16.568
It's a cousin of wolfsbane, except
this stuff is safe in small doses.

50:16.569 --> 50:20.154
It's a super oxidant
breed, radical detox.

50:20.155 --> 50:22.657
It promotes white
blood cell growth.

50:22.658 --> 50:25.743
Which fight infection.
Do you have some?

50:25.744 --> 50:27.048
Well, it's perennial.

50:27.049 --> 50:29.414
It grows everywhere,
but only in the spring.

50:29.415 --> 50:33.076
Fuck! This is bullshit, OK?

50:35.296 --> 50:38.840
- I seeded some, I'm growing it.
- She doesn't have time for that.

50:38.841 --> 50:41.414
She's killed a dog already.

50:41.440 --> 50:44.470
She's fucked. She's growing
a tail. Did you tell him that?

50:44.471 --> 50:46.298
Ginger!

50:46.932 --> 50:49.759
You're growing a tail?

50:49.893 --> 50:51.428
Yes.

50:55.024 --> 50:57.317
Look, he's just another
wank job. OK?

50:57.318 --> 51:00.194
What the fuck do you think
you are? Give me that.

51:00.195 --> 51:02.822
What the fuck are you?
Pervert, she's 15!

51:02.823 --> 51:05.108
Ginger, wait outside!

51:12.041 --> 51:16.853
Fine, if he rapes you, don't
come crying. I'll be at home.

51:21.383 --> 51:24.169
She's just freaking.

51:24.970 --> 51:28.040
I do not think of you that way.

51:45.523 --> 51:48.624
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

52:01.924 --> 52:05.510
Your dad's battery is dead again.
He's stranded at the supermarket.

52:05.511 --> 52:08.179
- Wanna go for a ride?
- Jesus, can't you knock?

52:08.180 --> 52:10.757
Don't you 'Jesus' me.

52:11.058 --> 52:13.017
You don't have anything
I haven't seen before.

52:13.018 --> 52:14.185
That's what you think.

52:14.186 --> 52:15.812
What is that supposed to mean?

52:15.813 --> 52:20.058
Nothing, I'm just, I'm fat,
all right. Get out!

52:20.150 --> 52:22.235
Ginger, you are not fat.

52:22.236 --> 52:25.530
These fashion models are all
on speed to look like that.

52:25.531 --> 52:27.899
Get out!

52:28.992 --> 52:31.786
OK. Gosh.

52:31.787 --> 52:34.030
I'll be back soon.

52:52.015 --> 52:55.134
Give me back my dog.

52:55.144 --> 53:00.223
- Trina, I don't have your dog.
- Ginger took him. I saw her.

53:00.607 --> 53:06.354
You know, I feel sorry for you.
He doesn't like you.

53:06.947 --> 53:11.401
He's a cherry-hound.
He's into virgins.

53:11.785 --> 53:14.161
Trina, you're bleeding. Go home.

53:14.162 --> 53:18.332
If you are so fucking smart, you
won't give him the satisfaction.

53:18.333 --> 53:22.003
Somebody just once shouldn't give
that fucker the satisfaction!

53:22.004 --> 53:25.256
- Trina, go now.
- You are as big a cunt as your sister.

53:25.257 --> 53:27.258
I am not.

53:27.259 --> 53:30.928
- Hey, meat. Back for more?
- What are you doing?

53:30.929 --> 53:35.474
I don't know, B. What am I doing?
Call Sam. Ask the pro.

53:35.475 --> 53:37.218
What?

53:37.227 --> 53:41.355
You play with your new friends,
and I'll play with mine.

53:41.356 --> 53:44.567
Ginger, what the
hell are you doing?

53:44.568 --> 53:48.613
You smell yummy. What is that?
Citrus or antiseptic? I'm not sure.

53:48.614 --> 53:50.857
Are you crazy?

53:52.117 --> 53:56.662
- OK, that's enough. Just let her go.
- Shut up. Shut up, shut up.

53:56.663 --> 53:59.874
OK, let's just chill. Right, Trina?

53:59.875 --> 54:00.583
You know what, Trina?

54:00.584 --> 54:03.210
She's doing your boy, now. I wouldn't
be so quick to get so friendly.

54:03.211 --> 54:06.380
- Stop it, it's not like that.
- I think she's scared for you, love, huh?

54:06.381 --> 54:08.174
She's an asshole.
She's not worth it.

54:08.175 --> 54:10.134
You asked for this!

54:10.135 --> 54:14.764
You picked Sam over me. Whatever
happens now, it is your fault!

54:14.765 --> 54:20.311
- This is not you. Just let's cope.
- Oh, with what? With this kind of shit.

54:20.312 --> 54:22.938
He's wrong, moron.
You can't fix this!

54:22.939 --> 54:25.024
You don't know that.
Just give me a chance.

54:25.025 --> 54:27.401
What, another one?
God gee, I don't know, B...

54:27.402 --> 54:29.070
see I'm going way way out there...

54:29.071 --> 54:33.733
way way far from where you live,
which you pretty much fucking rule.

54:34.576 --> 54:40.790
Oh god, that's disgusting,
you fucking gross, fucking...

54:40.791 --> 54:41.791
Back!

54:41.792 --> 54:46.337
Don't touch me, you freaks.
You're both just totally fucked.

54:46.338 --> 54:48.748
Trina, we were just...

54:52.928 --> 54:55.004
Uh-oh.

55:13.532 --> 55:15.650
Get up!

55:19.371 --> 55:21.656
Get up now!

55:22.082 --> 55:25.660
Henry, what on earth are
you doing out there?

55:26.378 --> 55:31.082
Come on, don't eat it
until we get inside.

55:35.804 --> 55:39.632
Jesus Christ on a
bicycle! What the...?

55:41.810 --> 55:44.603
Girls, I told you, no
more deaths in the house!

55:44.604 --> 55:47.398
Don't be mad,
it's for extra credit.

55:47.399 --> 55:50.685
Back to immaculate in ten minutes.

55:52.779 --> 55:56.315
Corn syrup. Dad, d'you want some?

55:59.286 --> 56:02.780
Well I better get this meat away.

56:03.206 --> 56:05.491
I'll do that.

56:13.300 --> 56:16.168
- Mom.
- What?

56:20.265 --> 56:23.009
What do guys want?

56:26.771 --> 56:31.559
Brigitte, I'm so glad you asked.

56:35.155 --> 56:38.441
And that's what men want.

56:39.701 --> 56:44.330
Some of them might seem cool or different,
but they're all pretty much the same.

56:44.331 --> 56:47.499
- Totally.
- Thanks for sharing.

56:47.500 --> 56:50.745
Oh, honey, that's
what we're here for.

56:51.755 --> 56:57.418
Bed time. It's a school
night. Beauty rest.

57:11.483 --> 57:14.894
This is just great.

57:14.903 --> 57:19.732
Yeah, field hockey will suck now.

57:21.534 --> 57:24.737
Get me a screwdriver.

57:41.429 --> 57:43.172
Oh, god!

57:49.729 --> 57:51.722
Way to go.

58:14.671 --> 58:17.923
Here it is: 'Why your
daughter dates dummies?'

58:17.924 --> 58:21.377
I'm so glad I hung on to this.

58:21.553 --> 58:27.174
- I think they're up to something.
- They're just being normal teenage girls.

58:27.559 --> 58:31.679
Then why are they suddenly so
interested in what you have to say?

58:33.273 --> 58:38.561
Stay in your own little world, Henry.
This one just confuses you.

58:44.826 --> 58:48.078
Shit. Look at all the worms.

58:48.079 --> 58:52.283
Remember when I used to make you
eat them just to get in here?

58:52.667 --> 58:57.746
Shallow grave? Oh well,
seems appropriate.

58:59.507 --> 59:02.334
You dig for a while.

59:04.137 --> 59:05.929
Look,

59:05.930 --> 59:08.557
no one ever thinks chicks
do shit like this.

59:08.558 --> 59:13.103
Trust me, a girl can
only be a slut,

59:13.104 --> 59:17.808
a bitch, a tease, or
the virgin next door.

59:18.193 --> 59:22.146
We'll just coast on
how the world works.

59:26.534 --> 59:29.028
Think she's pretty?

59:30.538 --> 59:33.824
If I wasn't here,
would you eat her?

59:34.167 --> 59:36.118
No.

59:37.086 --> 59:43.208
- God, that'd be like, fucking her.
- You can't go out anymore.

59:45.470 --> 59:49.673
Well I can't stay in,
I'll go mental.

59:55.438 --> 59:59.024
We'll make Pam think
you're at school.

59:59.025 --> 01:00:02.402
We'll make school think
you're home sick.

01:00:02.403 --> 01:00:06.031
Just till there is no
doubt about us in this.

01:00:06.032 --> 01:00:11.570
Then we blow, as far away
from here as possible.

01:00:25.051 --> 01:00:27.636
Your attention, please.

01:00:27.637 --> 01:00:30.639
Starting immediately certain
students will be paged to the office

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:35.018
to assist the police regarding
Trina Sinclair's disappearance.

01:00:35.019 --> 01:00:36.520
She is dead, man.

01:00:36.521 --> 01:00:40.349
When your name is called,
please come to the office.

01:00:57.834 --> 01:01:00.786
Is Ginger avoiding me?

01:01:03.172 --> 01:01:06.174
'Cause I'm feeling
pretty good right now.

01:01:06.175 --> 01:01:09.136
I just got a few questions
for her, like uh...

01:01:09.137 --> 01:01:11.763
I'm growing a goddamn
tail outta my ass,

01:01:11.764 --> 01:01:16.435
and I thought she might have a few tips
on how to deal with keeping that quiet!

01:01:16.436 --> 01:01:18.478
Hurting me won't help.

01:01:18.504 --> 01:01:21.898
See? I'm up to some
whack shit right now.

01:01:21.899 --> 01:01:26.111
I'm way out on the corner
of 'Fucked-Up and Evil'.

01:01:26.696 --> 01:01:30.691
You wanna know what I did
for fun last night, huh?

01:01:30.992 --> 01:01:35.746
I killed my own freaking dog, OK?
What am I supposed to do about that?

01:01:35.747 --> 01:01:40.417
- You're gonna be in deep shit.
- I'm right with you on deep shit,

01:01:40.418 --> 01:01:43.120
and I think you know why.

01:01:44.338 --> 01:01:47.291
What's going on here?

01:01:49.802 --> 01:01:51.461
Thanks.

01:02:02.064 --> 01:02:06.234
- Ginger, how was school today?
- I don't know, I didn't go.

01:02:06.235 --> 01:02:08.320
- We had a field trip.
- Really?

01:02:08.321 --> 01:02:11.523
I didn't sign any form
for a field trip.

01:02:11.824 --> 01:02:13.992
Daddy, will you teach me
how to drive tonight?

01:02:13.993 --> 01:02:16.778
Next year. Maybe.

01:02:17.788 --> 01:02:18.872
So where did you go?

01:02:18.873 --> 01:02:21.791
- What if next year never comes?
- Ginger.

01:02:21.792 --> 01:02:23.043
Mr. Wayne called today.

01:02:23.044 --> 01:02:26.171
He wanted to know if you
were feeling any better.

01:02:26.172 --> 01:02:28.840
When you might be
coming back to school.

01:02:28.841 --> 01:02:32.928
The police wanna talk to you. Something
about a fight with a missing girl?

01:02:32.929 --> 01:02:36.506
- Daddy, may I be excused?
- No, you may not.

01:02:36.891 --> 01:02:40.510
- Ginger, wait.
- For what, B?

01:02:40.895 --> 01:02:43.013
Oh no, you don't.

01:02:47.693 --> 01:02:51.313
I want to know what's
going on. Right now.

01:02:57.578 --> 01:02:59.996
- What are these?
- Monkshood. Brigitte...

01:02:59.997 --> 01:03:01.478
Where did you get them?

01:03:01.504 --> 01:03:05.019
From a craft store.
Now, I want an answer.

01:03:08.297 --> 01:03:11.058
Trina Sinclair tried to beat me up,

01:03:11.084 --> 01:03:17.198
'cause Jason McCardy liked us better,
so Ginger beat her up. That's all.

01:03:17.224 --> 01:03:18.598
That's all?

01:03:18.599 --> 01:03:22.719
Beating up other girls?
Cutting classes?

01:03:23.104 --> 01:03:26.523
- I'm very disappointed, Brigitte.
- Sorry.

01:03:26.524 --> 01:03:30.944
You just do whatever she
wants you to. You always have.

01:03:30.945 --> 01:03:34.690
I really wish you'd start
thinking more for yourself.

01:03:37.368 --> 01:03:40.996
Do you think I should talk to her?

01:03:40.997 --> 01:03:43.407
Check in?

01:03:43.791 --> 01:03:48.003
She thinks it's cool you let us
figure stuff out for ourselves.

01:03:48.004 --> 01:03:49.538
Oh?

01:03:50.756 --> 01:03:52.499
Really?

01:03:55.469 --> 01:03:57.887
I wondered if that
approach was working.

01:03:57.888 --> 01:04:00.257
Look what Pamela had.

01:04:02.935 --> 01:04:07.689
- What are you doing? Stop!
- I'll just take it off.

01:04:07.690 --> 01:04:09.307
No!

01:04:09.358 --> 01:04:11.401
I killed their pets, B.

01:04:11.402 --> 01:04:15.739
And nothing helps except
tearing live things to pieces.

01:04:15.740 --> 01:04:18.108
I can't be like this.

01:04:18.200 --> 01:04:19.701
This is monkshood.

01:04:19.702 --> 01:04:24.364
First thing tomorrow we find out
how to use it and we take off.

01:04:25.624 --> 01:04:30.787
If you give up now, you leave me here
alone. I would never do that to you!

01:04:32.465 --> 01:04:36.209
I'm sorry. I'm scared.

01:05:00.326 --> 01:05:04.154
BCX radio wishes you
a happy Halloween...

01:05:31.565 --> 01:05:36.069
B, what the fuck are you doing?

01:05:36.070 --> 01:05:39.447
Hey... B, let me out!

01:05:39.448 --> 01:05:41.157
I have to deal with the cure.

01:05:41.158 --> 01:05:43.826
This way, you can't hurt
yourself or anybody else.

01:05:43.827 --> 01:05:50.625
Fuck. You fucking sissy little girl.
You're going rat me out?

01:05:50.626 --> 01:05:52.877
Just shut up and wait for me.

01:05:52.878 --> 01:05:57.040
You little bitch! Fuck you!
I hate you!

01:05:59.677 --> 01:06:02.345
B, let me out. Come on.

01:06:02.346 --> 01:06:03.880
B?

01:06:04.765 --> 01:06:06.182
B!

01:06:06.183 --> 01:06:08.468
Let me out!

01:06:22.116 --> 01:06:24.826
Holly shit, that's monkshood.
Where the fuck did you get that?

01:06:24.827 --> 01:06:29.990
I don't know if you smoke it or eat
it or what, but I need to try it now.

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:34.252
Well, you got me but...

01:06:34.253 --> 01:06:40.083
to be sure, I'd have to
say direct route. Inject it.

01:06:40.467 --> 01:06:45.471
But see, that's a bad idea Brigitte, because
neither of us know what this stuff does.

01:06:45.472 --> 01:06:49.050
It can't be worse
than being road kill.

01:06:50.144 --> 01:06:52.937
The dosage will be
a guess. I mean...

01:06:52.938 --> 01:06:55.148
It would have to be, there
is no way to match for...

01:06:55.149 --> 01:06:58.768
metabolism, body weight,
there could be side effects.

01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:05.525
- You can not try this alone.
- My sister will be there.

01:08:27.407 --> 01:08:31.861
Understand you may kill
her trying to save her.

01:08:32.203 --> 01:08:33.947
What?

01:08:34.247 --> 01:08:37.075
It's for Ginger, isn't it?

01:08:39.586 --> 01:08:45.207
Look, worst-case scenario,
you put her out of her misery.

01:08:46.093 --> 01:08:50.630
Just as long as you're prepared
for that, and I mean sure.

01:08:53.267 --> 01:08:56.261
Try to come tonight.

01:09:19.501 --> 01:09:22.712
Hey, have you seen Jason?

01:09:22.712 --> 01:09:25.673
Umm... you got a little...

01:09:25.674 --> 01:09:27.466
You're going to the
greenhouse bash tonight?

01:09:27.466 --> 01:09:29.801
- Erm, yeah.
- Good.

01:09:29.803 --> 01:09:33.798
I'm in charge of the prizes.
You, too, could be winner.

01:09:39.229 --> 01:09:42.140
Ginger. My office. Now.

01:09:46.653 --> 01:09:48.729
Help! Help!

01:09:56.788 --> 01:09:58.414
Help! Help!

01:09:58.415 --> 01:09:59.874
Let me go.

01:09:59.875 --> 01:10:01.617
Let me go!

01:10:01.918 --> 01:10:05.079
Let him go, McCardy.

01:10:07.591 --> 01:10:12.295
Oh yeah, a chick. Excellent.

01:10:12.596 --> 01:10:15.139
Come to papa, baby.

01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:17.800
Come and get some candy.

01:10:52.010 --> 01:10:54.504
I have to go. Um...

01:10:55.472 --> 01:10:58.257
I have a class.

01:11:04.564 --> 01:11:05.689
Attention please.

01:11:05.690 --> 01:11:08.108
Brigitte Fitzgerald,
please report to guidance.

01:11:08.109 --> 01:11:10.561
Brigitte Fitzerald to guidance.

01:11:33.552 --> 01:11:39.348
He wanted to call fucking Pamela,
B, and tell her we needed help.

01:11:39.349 --> 01:11:41.141
So, I stopped him.

01:11:41.142 --> 01:11:46.430
You see how that works?
How I do not betray you?

01:11:47.649 --> 01:11:50.393
I didn't betray you.

01:11:52.988 --> 01:11:57.900
You locked me up.

01:12:00.787 --> 01:12:04.156
You need to get this fixed.

01:12:04.624 --> 01:12:11.372
Why? So I can go to jail,
for the rest of my life?

01:12:14.134 --> 01:12:17.428
We wait till everyone leaves,

01:12:17.429 --> 01:12:22.300
then we clean this up, somehow.

01:12:22.684 --> 01:12:26.262
I think you've fucked up enough.

01:12:36.740 --> 01:12:39.734
Oh my god!

01:12:40.076 --> 01:12:43.487
- Henry?
- Oh g...

01:12:44.789 --> 01:12:46.782
What is it?

01:12:49.586 --> 01:12:55.458
Henry, for Pete's sake. It's
only the girls' death project.

01:12:56.718 --> 01:12:59.420
They're fake, you big baby.

01:13:39.010 --> 01:13:42.262
I'm gonna find something
to clean this up.

01:13:42.263 --> 01:13:46.425
Stay here and lock the door.

01:15:04.228 --> 01:15:06.205
Oh my god!

01:15:23.323 --> 01:15:25.407
Hello, Brigitte.

01:15:25.408 --> 01:15:27.868
- Stop it!
- Can I touch your boobies?

01:15:27.869 --> 01:15:29.870
I like little girls.

01:15:29.871 --> 01:15:31.371
Leave him alone!

01:15:31.372 --> 01:15:32.748
Ginger. Stop! Stop!

01:15:32.749 --> 01:15:34.625
Ginger, fucking stop!

01:15:34.626 --> 01:15:36.368
Please stop!

01:15:37.378 --> 01:15:41.757
Ginger, stop!
He hasn't done anything!

01:15:41.758 --> 01:15:45.127
I don't like how he looks at you.

01:15:56.731 --> 01:15:58.557
Oh my god!

01:16:11.704 --> 01:16:14.573
He found me. Brigitte.

01:16:14.957 --> 01:16:18.994
- The mess. I had to...
- Go to hell!

01:16:27.762 --> 01:16:32.549
He's not dead. You've infected him.

01:16:33.393 --> 01:16:36.095
Let me call help for him.

01:16:40.108 --> 01:16:41.850
Oh fuck!

01:16:42.819 --> 01:16:44.353
Fuck!

01:16:49.409 --> 01:16:51.276
You like it.

01:16:51.285 --> 01:16:56.740
It feels so... good, Brigitte.

01:16:57.875 --> 01:17:00.919
It's like touching yourself.

01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:05.382
You know every move...
right on the fucking dot.

01:17:05.383 --> 01:17:07.968
And after...

01:17:07.969 --> 01:17:13.423
you see fucking
fireworks, supernovas.

01:17:14.559 --> 01:17:17.803
I'm a goddamn force of nature.

01:17:18.437 --> 01:17:24.476
I feel like I could do
just about anything.

01:17:29.448 --> 01:17:33.702
You know we're almost not
even related anymore.

01:17:33.703 --> 01:17:36.154
You're fucked!

01:17:37.748 --> 01:17:40.375
You'd love it. Should
come for the ride.

01:17:40.376 --> 01:17:44.087
A little scratch. Swap some juice.

01:17:44.088 --> 01:17:48.133
We'll be our own pack,
like before. It's so us, B.

01:17:48.134 --> 01:17:52.045
I'd rather be dead
than be what you are.

01:17:52.430 --> 01:17:54.097
We have a pact!

01:17:54.098 --> 01:17:59.386
Out by sixteen or dead in this scene,
but together for fucking ever!

01:17:59.770 --> 01:18:02.230
I said I would die for you!

01:18:02.231 --> 01:18:08.478
No. You said you'd die with me.
'Cause you had nothing better to do.

01:18:10.907 --> 01:18:13.025
Fuck you too.

01:18:13.409 --> 01:18:18.238
You think I wanna go
back to being nobody?

01:18:18.623 --> 01:18:20.949
You're fucked!

01:18:21.334 --> 01:18:24.953
Stay the hell out of
my way, Brigitte.

01:18:25.504 --> 01:18:28.915
And I'll tell Sam you said hi.

01:19:11.926 --> 01:19:14.795
Stop! Stop!

01:19:29.402 --> 01:19:32.028
Where is your sister?

01:19:32.029 --> 01:19:34.572
County greenhouse.

01:19:34.573 --> 01:19:36.650
Get in the van.

01:20:02.059 --> 01:20:06.304
All right, Fitz.
Wicked costume, baby.

01:20:23.122 --> 01:20:25.073
Where is Sam?

01:20:32.506 --> 01:20:34.124
Shit!

01:20:35.509 --> 01:20:37.252
Hey.

01:20:37.761 --> 01:20:43.383
- Hey Ginger, where is Brigitte?
- She couldn't make it.

01:20:43.809 --> 01:20:46.928
- Yeah, why is that?
- Cramps.

01:20:47.897 --> 01:20:50.307
She says hi.

01:20:52.818 --> 01:20:54.903
You wanna buy or something?

01:20:54.904 --> 01:20:57.063
Or something.

01:21:09.084 --> 01:21:12.253
- Go get your sister.
- Mom, I don't think...

01:21:12.254 --> 01:21:15.290
You've done a terrible thing.

01:21:15.633 --> 01:21:17.375
But...

01:21:18.886 --> 01:21:22.130
you're my tiny babies.

01:21:22.973 --> 01:21:26.309
It's one thing if you
leave, it's almost normal,

01:21:26.310 --> 01:21:29.304
but no one is gonna
take you from me.

01:21:30.314 --> 01:21:33.983
First thing tomorrow I'll let the house
fill up with gas, and light a match.

01:21:33.984 --> 01:21:35.485
What?

01:21:35.486 --> 01:21:40.815
We'll start fresh. Just
us girls. It'll be fun.

01:21:41.951 --> 01:21:44.194
What about dad?

01:21:44.536 --> 01:21:49.324
He'll just blame me, they all will.

01:21:53.337 --> 01:21:56.623
This isn't your fault, mom.

01:22:03.263 --> 01:22:05.215
Yes it is.

01:22:08.936 --> 01:22:11.429
Lock the doors, OK?

01:22:20.364 --> 01:22:24.567
- Ginger, come on.
- No, you come on.

01:22:25.369 --> 01:22:30.615
- What are you doing?
- I know you want to. Everybody does.

01:22:31.667 --> 01:22:36.212
Really, what would I be like?

01:22:36.213 --> 01:22:38.706
What would I do?

01:22:39.091 --> 01:22:45.054
- What would I feel like inside?
- Ginger, stop.

01:22:45.055 --> 01:22:49.384
- Make me.
- Ginger, your sister...

01:23:13.208 --> 01:23:15.451
This is fucked.

01:23:16.378 --> 01:23:19.714
Ginger, get off me. Get off me.

01:23:19.715 --> 01:23:21.583
Ginger, get off me!

01:23:24.011 --> 01:23:25.887
Jerk!

01:23:25.888 --> 01:23:30.049
What? I told you to stop. Oh Jesus.

01:23:31.226 --> 01:23:34.061
God, Ginger get up. I'm sorry.

01:23:34.062 --> 01:23:36.556
Get up, Ginger.

01:23:39.651 --> 01:23:40.860
You bitch!

01:23:40.861 --> 01:23:42.528
You want me? You want me?

01:23:42.529 --> 01:23:45.823
Stop hurting everybody
else and take me. Take me!

01:23:45.824 --> 01:23:50.111
I don't want you!
I don't even know you!

01:23:52.956 --> 01:23:55.199
Brigitte, don't.

01:24:01.256 --> 01:24:03.416
Brigitte, don't!

01:24:03.592 --> 01:24:08.004
You wrecked everything for
me that isn't about you.

01:24:10.557 --> 01:24:12.175
No.

01:24:13.477 --> 01:24:15.094
Shit.

01:24:16.897 --> 01:24:19.307
Now I am you.

01:24:21.276 --> 01:24:25.772
I know you are. But what am I?

01:24:27.699 --> 01:24:30.026
We got to go.

01:25:01.733 --> 01:25:05.561
B, I can't. I'm turning too fast.

01:25:10.826 --> 01:25:15.329
- What the hell did you do that for?
- I won't let you do this, Brigitte.

01:25:15.330 --> 01:25:17.581
You both need help.

01:25:17.582 --> 01:25:20.451
You fucking idiot!

01:25:20.669 --> 01:25:21.836
The cure works.

01:25:21.837 --> 01:25:24.338
I had to use it on somebody else,
but there is more at the house.

01:25:24.339 --> 01:25:27.091
This is the only way I could
get her to come back with me.

01:25:27.092 --> 01:25:29.377
Oh shit!

01:25:29.553 --> 01:25:32.713
What? How was I
supposed to know that?

01:25:35.183 --> 01:25:39.645
Just help me, OK? Just get her
in your truck and drive us home.

01:25:39.646 --> 01:25:43.599
Fine, but she rides in the back.

01:25:55.996 --> 01:25:59.407
This is nuts, you need a doctor.

01:26:02.753 --> 01:26:04.203
Oh!

01:26:04.963 --> 01:26:06.581
Jesus.

01:26:08.758 --> 01:26:12.178
She could have killed
you, Brigitte.

01:26:12.179 --> 01:26:14.964
She needs me.

01:26:15.265 --> 01:26:20.094
Get home. Cure her, cure me.

01:26:20.312 --> 01:26:22.555
And then what?

01:26:22.981 --> 01:26:24.682
Run.

01:26:26.109 --> 01:26:29.395
You know you're kidding yourself.

01:27:15.909 --> 01:27:20.529
I'll be right back.
Give me the syringe.

01:27:25.794 --> 01:27:28.412
Dad? Hello?

01:27:29.297 --> 01:27:30.915
Oh shit!

01:27:34.135 --> 01:27:37.213
Yeah, I've meant to fix that.

01:27:37.973 --> 01:27:42.635
- Did she get out?
- Oh god, I hope not.

01:27:43.019 --> 01:27:45.346
I can't see anything.

01:27:47.565 --> 01:27:50.017
Pass me that flashlight.

01:28:17.554 --> 01:28:19.004
Fuck!

01:28:21.057 --> 01:28:24.760
That was your god damn sister!

01:28:28.231 --> 01:28:30.057
Oh fuck.

01:28:32.527 --> 01:28:35.438
The monkshood's in there.

01:28:35.864 --> 01:28:39.108
Oh, you're out of your mind.

01:28:39.534 --> 01:28:41.652
Not yet.

01:28:42.036 --> 01:28:46.031
Be quiet. I gotta get this stuff.

01:28:52.839 --> 01:28:54.582
Great.

01:29:21.826 --> 01:29:24.570
Fuck! Where the fuck is she?

01:29:28.041 --> 01:29:29.783
Shh.

01:29:50.063 --> 01:29:52.973
- Let's do this fast.
- Hell, yes.

01:29:56.444 --> 01:29:59.438
All right, bowls.

01:30:01.157 --> 01:30:03.651
Alcohol, alcohol.

01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:12.284
Brigitte.

01:30:13.628 --> 01:30:15.704
Could I have your lighter?

01:30:15.922 --> 01:30:19.124
I can't feel my hand.

01:30:19.384 --> 01:30:21.210
Jesus Christ.

01:30:24.889 --> 01:30:25.931
Oh fuck!

01:30:25.932 --> 01:30:28.217
Go! Go!

01:30:37.527 --> 01:30:39.403
- Alcohol.
- What?

01:30:39.404 --> 01:30:43.232
- Alcohol!
- Oh shit. Yeah.

01:30:46.286 --> 01:30:49.071
Start grinding up the buds.

01:30:56.796 --> 01:30:59.498
All right, pour it in.

01:31:00.425 --> 01:31:03.127
Easy, easy, easy...

01:31:04.470 --> 01:31:06.755
What was that?

01:31:09.309 --> 01:31:12.636
Shit, keep going. Go, go.

01:31:13.396 --> 01:31:15.556
All right, hold this.

01:31:21.362 --> 01:31:27.025
- Right, that's real fucking hygienic.
- I doubt it matters.

01:31:31.372 --> 01:31:33.123
How about you take
this and we blow?

01:31:33.124 --> 01:31:35.993
How about no?

01:31:37.879 --> 01:31:39.921
Then let me do it,
you can hardly move.

01:31:39.922 --> 01:31:41.749
No!

01:31:42.258 --> 01:31:45.169
You can't do this by yourself.

01:31:45.553 --> 01:31:48.430
Let me take the needle,
I'll go into the living room,

01:31:48.431 --> 01:31:52.676
you lead her in, bam we're done.

01:31:56.981 --> 01:31:59.767
- OK.
- OK.

01:32:07.450 --> 01:32:11.028
- I'm going.
- Be careful.

01:35:29.360 --> 01:35:31.102
Sam?

01:36:06.689 --> 01:36:08.557
Ginger?

01:37:53.337 --> 01:37:55.205
I can't.

01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:58.708
I won't.

01:38:00.177 --> 01:38:02.253
The fuck.

01:38:54.565 --> 01:38:56.307
Fuck off!

01:38:59.027 --> 01:39:01.020
Leave me alone!

01:40:37.376 --> 01:40:39.118
Ginger?

01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:46.751
Come on. It's me.

01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:50.379
OK?

01:40:52.182 --> 01:40:55.301
Ginger, please, it's me!

01:41:05.987 --> 01:41:08.272
You want this?

01:41:12.202 --> 01:41:14.695
You want this?

01:41:29.177 --> 01:41:33.047
I'm not dying in
this room with you!

01:41:36.768 --> 01:41:39.262
I'm not dying!

01:45:06.603 --> 01:45:11.303
