¶ for he's a jolly good fellow ¶

01:26.304 --> 01:30.241
¶ which nobody can deny ¶

01:30.308 --> 01:33.210
¶ except his ex-wife. ¶

01:33.278 --> 01:34.678
(all laughing)

01:34.746 --> 01:36.213
So what are you going to do
without us numskulls

01:36.281 --> 01:37.648
To supervise?

01:37.716 --> 01:40.584
I plan to fill the void
with gardening, early dining,

01:40.652 --> 01:43.254
And I've been learning
to speak mandarin chinese.

01:43.321 --> 01:45.022
(speaking pseudo-mandarin)

01:45.090 --> 01:47.091
That's garbage,
that's total garbage.

01:47.159 --> 01:48.459
(homer humming)

01:48.527 --> 01:49.660
I'm going to miss ted.

01:49.728 --> 01:51.328
He was a good
supervisor.

01:51.396 --> 01:52.396
Definitely
hands-off.

01:52.464 --> 01:53.831
He didn't mind
if we punched in

01:53.899 --> 01:55.299
A little late
or not at all.

01:55.367 --> 01:58.736
Or that we made a few
adjustments to the soda machine.

01:58.804 --> 02:00.538
(all laugh)

02:00.605 --> 02:01.539
Carl:
Yeah.

02:01.606 --> 02:02.406
Homer:
Beer.

02:03.642 --> 02:07.878
Here's to us--
the unsupervisables.

02:07.946 --> 02:09.180
(groans)

02:09.247 --> 02:10.914
I expect you're all
anxiously awaiting

02:10.982 --> 02:13.150
My choice
for your new supervisor.

02:13.218 --> 02:16.220
Can't we just all supervise
ourselves?

02:16.288 --> 02:18.656
(all giggling excitedly)

02:19.858 --> 02:21.759
(tires screeching)

02:31.203 --> 02:33.170
I win!

02:33.238 --> 02:35.206
In any event,

02:35.273 --> 02:38.109
Much as what formerly was
my kidney is now my heart,

02:38.176 --> 02:40.311
I have decided
to promote from within.

02:40.378 --> 02:42.847
One of you will get the job.

02:42.914 --> 02:45.316
But which one?

02:45.383 --> 02:47.718
(fly buzzing)

02:49.821 --> 02:50.754
(guzzling)

02:50.822 --> 02:51.989
Aah!

02:55.026 --> 02:56.393
(electrical buzzing)

02:58.363 --> 02:59.430
Hmm...

02:59.498 --> 03:01.031
Congratulations.

03:01.099 --> 03:03.467
I dub thee king
of the morons,

03:03.535 --> 03:06.137
Also known as supervisor
for sector 7-g.

03:06.204 --> 03:09.340
Here is your key to
the executive washroom.

03:09.407 --> 03:10.541
Hmm.

03:14.112 --> 03:16.147
Lenny & homer:
Whoo-hoo!

03:16.214 --> 03:18.082
Our boss is our best buddy.

03:18.150 --> 03:20.117
The nitwits are running
the goofhouse.

03:20.185 --> 03:21.952
Yeah.

03:22.020 --> 03:23.754
Hey, carl, why aren't you
high-fiving?

03:23.822 --> 03:26.290
You know, I'd rather
save my arm-lifting

03:26.358 --> 03:29.627
For tapping gauges or filling
out employee evaluations.

03:29.694 --> 03:30.961
We can celebrate
at moe's.

03:31.029 --> 03:32.530
(delighted whooping)

03:32.597 --> 03:33.531
After work.

03:33.598 --> 03:34.932
(both groan)

03:35.000 --> 03:37.935
And the first beer's on me.

03:38.003 --> 03:39.537
You see, he
hasn't changed.

03:39.604 --> 03:40.971
Carl (over p.A.):
Yes, I have,

03:41.039 --> 03:44.074
In ways you're only beginning
to suspect.

03:45.010 --> 03:45.943
(clinking)

03:46.011 --> 03:47.811
I call to order
this meeting

03:47.879 --> 03:50.481
Of the springfield
charity chicks.

03:50.549 --> 03:53.617
As you all know, last year's
cake and cookie sale raised

03:53.685 --> 03:58.255
$112 to fight childhood obesity.

03:59.524 --> 04:01.625
(moans)

04:01.693 --> 04:03.928
Thank you, charity chicks.

04:03.995 --> 04:06.063
Whoa!

04:07.199 --> 04:08.265
Now, who has ideas

04:08.333 --> 04:10.000
For this year's fundraiser?

04:10.068 --> 04:12.136
Well, the police department
raised money

04:12.204 --> 04:13.737
By selling
these beefcake calendars.

04:13.805 --> 04:14.772
Ooh, that's quite
a thing.

04:14.839 --> 04:15.806
Mrs. Skinner:
Yeah, great.

04:23.915 --> 04:25.516
I have a
great idea.

04:25.584 --> 04:27.484
Let's do what they
did but with us.

04:27.552 --> 04:29.553
We are
a good-looking bunch.

04:29.621 --> 04:31.789
(excited chatter)

04:31.856 --> 04:33.624
We just need a theme.

04:33.692 --> 04:34.959
Hmm.

04:35.026 --> 04:37.628
Ah!

04:37.696 --> 04:38.896
How about history?

04:38.964 --> 04:40.998
(overlapping chatter)

04:41.066 --> 04:42.032
Then it's set.

04:42.100 --> 04:43.534
We'll do it on the 25th of....

04:43.602 --> 04:44.802
(groans)

04:44.869 --> 04:46.370
...Wiggum.

04:46.438 --> 04:48.439
(camera shutter clicking)

04:48.506 --> 04:52.343
Okay, betsy ross,
bring history to life.

04:52.410 --> 04:53.744
Ooh, I love it.

04:53.812 --> 04:55.212
Don't stop, don't
stop, don't stop.

04:55.280 --> 04:56.747
Okay, stop, we got plenty.

04:56.815 --> 04:59.783
All right, who's my next
sexy historical lady?

04:59.851 --> 05:00.884
I am.

05:00.952 --> 05:03.988
The female tiger woods
of the 1930s--

05:04.055 --> 05:06.423
Babe didrikson zaharias.

05:06.491 --> 05:09.026
Ooh, you know marge,
if you want to sell calendars,

05:09.094 --> 05:10.261
I'm going
to need to see

05:10.328 --> 05:13.530
More "babe" and less
"didrikson zaharias."

05:13.598 --> 05:16.066
Fine, I'll take
off one glove.

05:16.134 --> 05:18.002
Mm-hmm.

05:18.069 --> 05:20.070
Hmm, you know
what would look super good?

05:20.138 --> 05:23.040
If you held
this glass of red wine.

05:25.210 --> 05:28.212
Mmm, I love this wine.

05:28.280 --> 05:29.413
Yeah, it's andalusian.

05:29.481 --> 05:31.048
Well, it seems real to me.

05:31.116 --> 05:32.116
(laughs)

05:32.183 --> 05:34.084
Okay, more wine
for you.

05:34.152 --> 05:35.286
(raucous laughter)

05:38.156 --> 05:40.224
(humming)

05:40.292 --> 05:41.825
<i>Ooh, that's caliente, baby.</i>

05:41.893 --> 05:43.160
Ooh, ooh,

05:43.228 --> 05:45.062
Pop goes the chupacabra.

05:45.130 --> 05:46.864
(marge humming,
camera shutter clicking)

05:48.066 --> 05:49.099
Whoop!
Okay.

05:49.167 --> 05:51.168
Mmm, oh, meow.

05:51.236 --> 05:52.403
Meow, meow, meow.

05:52.470 --> 05:56.006
(humming)

05:56.074 --> 05:57.007
Whoops!

05:57.075 --> 05:58.242
(giggling)

06:01.446 --> 06:03.547
(homer laughs)

06:03.615 --> 06:04.682
Hey, carl,

06:04.749 --> 06:05.916
Look how I messed
with the names

06:05.984 --> 06:07.451
On the softball
sign-up sheet.

06:07.519 --> 06:08.686
(giggling)

06:08.753 --> 06:09.953
It's delicious.

06:10.021 --> 06:11.655
You know how smitty's name
is smitty?

06:11.723 --> 06:12.656
(laughs)

06:12.724 --> 06:13.957
Well, not anymore.

06:14.025 --> 06:15.859
I changed the "m" to a...

06:15.927 --> 06:16.960
That'll do, homer.

06:17.028 --> 06:18.195
...To a "p"--

06:18.263 --> 06:19.596
Spitty, 'cause he
spits when he talks.

06:19.664 --> 06:21.398
He had to have part
of his tongue removed.

06:21.466 --> 06:22.533
That's real funny.

06:22.600 --> 06:23.901
Oh, well, I
didn't know that.

06:23.968 --> 06:25.836
Well, now you know.

06:26.838 --> 06:28.339
Oh, quit dragging me.

06:28.406 --> 06:30.140
When I grow up,
I'm gonna drag you around

06:30.208 --> 06:31.442
And buy you clothes.

06:31.509 --> 06:33.677
Oh, that's wonderful.

06:33.745 --> 06:34.678
(groans)

06:34.746 --> 06:36.613
What's all the hubbub-aloo?

06:36.681 --> 06:38.482
(moans)

06:38.550 --> 06:40.451
(screams)

06:40.518 --> 06:42.553
I've been pin-upped.

06:42.620 --> 06:45.022
(groaning)

06:45.090 --> 06:46.857
And every month is me.

06:46.925 --> 06:48.225
(gasps)

06:48.293 --> 06:49.960
I don't remember
doing this.

06:50.028 --> 06:51.295
(gasps)

06:51.363 --> 06:55.165
I certainly don't remember
doing August.

06:55.233 --> 06:58.502
Hey, calendar lady, you
gonna take your clothes off?

06:58.570 --> 06:59.603
No.

06:59.671 --> 07:01.705
Well, I got the
next best thing.

07:01.773 --> 07:04.375
(chuckling)

07:04.442 --> 07:05.409
Whoo-hoo.

07:05.477 --> 07:08.312
(chuckling)

07:11.222 --> 07:12.589
Great safety report,
homer.

07:12.657 --> 07:14.057
No meltdowns all week.

07:14.125 --> 07:17.227
I'm making you
my new executive assistant.

07:17.295 --> 07:20.063
Why can't I keep the job
I have now, whatever it is?

07:20.131 --> 07:21.498
Not an option,
big fella.

07:21.566 --> 07:24.368
Either you're my assistant
or you find a job elsewhere,

07:24.435 --> 07:27.237
And in this economy,
elsewhere ain't hiring.

07:27.305 --> 07:29.540
Oh, fine, I guess
I'm at your beck.

07:29.607 --> 07:30.574
And call.

07:30.642 --> 07:31.775
No...!

07:31.843 --> 07:32.910
Yeah.

07:34.746 --> 07:37.581
Oh, no,

07:37.649 --> 07:39.616
It's a big turnout
at church today,

07:39.684 --> 07:43.353
And the whole congregation has
seen my scandinavian regions.

07:44.556 --> 07:47.257
(crowd murmuring)

07:47.325 --> 07:48.992
Here comes the woman
who made February

07:49.060 --> 07:51.161
The hottest month of the year.

07:51.229 --> 07:53.797
Her shapely gams
have finally persuaded me

07:53.865 --> 07:55.899
To switch from the julian
calendar to the gregorian.

07:55.967 --> 07:57.868
Marge, girl,

07:57.936 --> 08:00.270
I just heard
your pants ain't hiring

08:00.338 --> 08:02.606
Because your butt won't quit.

08:02.674 --> 08:04.908
(sighing)

08:06.110 --> 08:08.679
(groans)

08:08.746 --> 08:11.648
Homie, everyone
loved my calendar,

08:11.716 --> 08:13.951
But only you get
to flip the pages.

08:14.018 --> 08:15.252
Calendar?

08:15.320 --> 08:18.855
Oh, my god, I forgot to move
carl's 12:30 to 2:30.

08:18.923 --> 08:20.824
Oh, his astrologist will show up

08:20.892 --> 08:23.060
At the same time
as his astronomer.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.095
This is not good,
this is not good.

08:25.163 --> 08:26.430
(moans)

08:26.497 --> 08:29.933
How about a little
marge madness?

08:30.001 --> 08:32.135
(horn blowing)

08:36.674 --> 08:40.110
(motor stalling)

08:40.178 --> 08:42.913
Oh, who am I kidding?

08:48.052 --> 08:50.120
Marge, would you mind
if we just cuddle?

08:50.188 --> 08:51.922
Cuddling's for after.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.024
(marge moaning)

08:54.092 --> 08:56.259
(both moaning)

08:56.327 --> 08:58.829
(homer snoring, marge gasping)

09:02.567 --> 09:05.102
(mumbling)

09:05.169 --> 09:06.136
(sighs)

09:06.204 --> 09:07.604
Tomorrow, my love.

09:09.340 --> 09:10.273
(groans)

09:10.341 --> 09:11.441
Stupid carl.

09:11.509 --> 09:13.043
"update the phone list,
homer.

09:13.111 --> 09:14.177
"you put my
contact lenses in

09:14.245 --> 09:15.212
Backwards, homer."

09:15.279 --> 09:16.179
(sighs)

09:16.247 --> 09:17.481
I'm sorry, honey.

09:17.548 --> 09:19.783
Maybe this will take
your mind off work.

09:21.285 --> 09:22.252
Wash my car.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.553
Re-foam my latte.

09:23.621 --> 09:24.588
Book me a massage.

09:24.656 --> 09:25.756
Shiatsu or better.

09:25.823 --> 09:26.890
(screams)
leave me alone, you two!

09:26.958 --> 09:28.458
(sobbing)

09:29.627 --> 09:31.895
(sighs)

09:31.963 --> 09:33.497
<i>Mrs. Krabappel:
Class,</i>

09:33.564 --> 09:34.765
Today we're going to talk

09:34.832 --> 09:36.400
About washington crossing
the delaware.

09:36.467 --> 09:39.369
I'd like to watch bart's mom
washing her underwear.

09:39.437 --> 09:41.405
The british were led
by general howe.

09:41.472 --> 09:43.540
I'd give bart's mom
a general wow.

09:43.608 --> 09:44.775
Knock it off.

09:44.842 --> 09:46.476
That's my mom you're
talking about.

09:46.544 --> 09:49.212
Keep-away
with bart's mom.

09:49.280 --> 09:53.517
Mrs. S.,
you can tuck me in anytime.

09:53.584 --> 09:55.952
Okay, buddy,
lower the eyebrows,

09:56.020 --> 09:57.888
Nice and easy.

10:00.958 --> 10:02.893
Ow!
It's stuck!

10:02.960 --> 10:06.496
I'll have a quizzical expression
for the rest of my life.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.765
I'd like to get quizzical
with bart's mom.

10:08.833 --> 10:10.200
Shut up!

10:10.268 --> 10:11.568
(both grunt)

10:11.636 --> 10:13.737
Standing up for yourself
to an older boy?

10:13.805 --> 10:15.172
We're going to
have to set up

10:15.239 --> 10:16.506
An appointment
with your parents.

10:16.574 --> 10:19.176
Let me, uh,
check my calendar.

10:19.243 --> 10:20.544
(chuckles slyly)

10:20.611 --> 10:24.614
I'm suddenly feeling, uh,
un-administrative feelings.

10:24.682 --> 10:25.582
(both laughing lasciviously)

10:25.650 --> 10:26.583
Yes.

10:26.651 --> 10:28.518
(groans)

10:30.254 --> 10:31.188
(floorboards creaking)

10:31.255 --> 10:32.456
Homie?

10:32.523 --> 10:34.691
Honey, I know it's been
a rough couple of weeks,

10:34.759 --> 10:36.960
But I booked us a night
this Saturday

10:37.028 --> 10:39.563
At a very
romantic hotel.

10:39.630 --> 10:40.764
Garden view?

10:40.832 --> 10:43.700
Ocean view,
obstructed.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.203
(swoons)

10:50.208 --> 10:52.142
All right, I put in
a hundred-hour work week,

10:52.210 --> 10:54.377
But I took a power nap
while I was driving us here

10:54.445 --> 10:55.912
And now I'm rarin' to go.

10:55.980 --> 11:00.417
Well, I brought a few items to
make our night extra special--

11:00.485 --> 11:04.254
Massage oil, some lingerie
from the horny hubby,

11:04.322 --> 11:06.256
And snuggle dice.

11:06.324 --> 11:09.526
This one has an action
and this one has a body part.

11:09.594 --> 11:10.861
See?

11:10.928 --> 11:12.696
"nuzzle... Neck."

11:12.764 --> 11:14.731
With pleasure!

11:14.799 --> 11:16.666
Let me try.

11:16.734 --> 11:18.368
"lick... Eyes."

11:18.436 --> 11:19.736
Uh, I'll try again.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.706
"spank... Hair"?

11:22.774 --> 11:23.840
What the...?

11:23.908 --> 11:25.108
(die rattling)

11:25.176 --> 11:27.310
"whisper into ass"?

11:27.378 --> 11:29.212
Oh, this game sucks!

11:29.280 --> 11:32.716
Why don't you just roll me?

11:32.784 --> 11:34.785
We're gonna be...

11:34.852 --> 11:37.487
(yawns) snore in the morning.

11:37.555 --> 11:40.123
Damn it, why won't
you touch me?

11:40.191 --> 11:41.358
Mm... Ooh.

11:43.194 --> 11:44.427
Okay.

11:44.495 --> 11:45.829
Kiss me, baby!

11:45.897 --> 11:47.931
Kiss me like a frog
in a fairy tale!

11:47.999 --> 11:50.700
(moaning and squealing)

11:50.768 --> 11:53.637
(phone ringing)

11:56.574 --> 11:58.542
Carl:
Great news, homer!

11:58.609 --> 12:00.277
I've been invited to the annual

12:00.344 --> 12:02.913
Nuclear-power expo
in paris, France.

12:02.980 --> 12:05.215
That's right,
we're going to fission week!

12:05.283 --> 12:06.516
(squealing):
Oh! Whoo-hoo!

12:06.584 --> 12:08.351
I need you to book me
a room at the ritz,

12:08.419 --> 12:10.086
With a view
of jim morrison's grave

12:10.154 --> 12:11.588
And book me dinner
at that place.

12:11.656 --> 12:12.923
You know the one,
the one lenny's mom

12:12.990 --> 12:14.457
Read about two years ago.

12:14.525 --> 12:17.627
(groaning)

12:20.598 --> 12:23.099
I'll make it up to you,
marge, I swear.

12:23.167 --> 12:25.435
<i>Last night was the
making it up to me!</i>

12:25.503 --> 12:26.837
The most intimate moment

12:26.904 --> 12:29.606
We shared this week was
my ironing your shirts!

12:29.674 --> 12:31.274
Actually, those
were carl's shirts.

12:31.342 --> 12:32.676
Oh!

12:32.743 --> 12:34.110
I can't believe
you're gonna spend

12:34.178 --> 12:35.745
Another weekend with him.

12:35.813 --> 12:37.647
Hey, it's not like
I want to go.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.249
Go, go, go!

12:39.317 --> 12:41.284
No!!

12:41.352 --> 12:42.886
(grunting angrily)

12:45.756 --> 12:47.591
Diddily...

12:49.193 --> 12:50.560
(gasps)

12:55.374 --> 12:57.942
Okay, fission week
kicks off on Monday

12:58.010 --> 13:01.212
With a reception by the
international proton council.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.549
Word is, protons
are the new electrons.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.485
You know, homer,
when I was your age,

13:07.553 --> 13:09.721
It was the future,
'cause I'm younger than you.

13:09.788 --> 13:10.855
Just something
to think about.

13:10.923 --> 13:12.457
I will.
Edamame?

13:12.525 --> 13:13.525
I don't have time for peeling.

13:13.592 --> 13:14.526
Squirt them in.

13:18.531 --> 13:20.665
Well, boys, daddy's
back on the beam,

13:20.733 --> 13:23.535
Thanks to christian prayer
and doctor sheldon lowenstein.

13:23.602 --> 13:25.303
We thought you
were gonna die.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.472
And then uncle kevin
would have to raise us.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.474
With his funny friend, david.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.309
Oh, I'd put rocks
into your pockets

13:31.377 --> 13:33.311
And walk you out to sea
before that happened.

13:33.379 --> 13:34.712
Yay!
Yay!
(doorbell ringing)

13:36.315 --> 13:38.116
Ned, to make up
for what happened,

13:38.183 --> 13:39.651
I want to invite
you and the boys

13:39.718 --> 13:41.019
Over to dinner
tomorrow night.

13:41.086 --> 13:43.087
Okily-dokily,
but I'm warning you,

13:43.155 --> 13:45.557
You're gonna see america's
number one dishwashing crew!

13:45.624 --> 13:47.559
I wash!
And I dry!

13:47.626 --> 13:51.062
Then I give 'em the squeak test
and into the dishwasher they go.

13:51.130 --> 13:52.030
Oh!

14:05.778 --> 14:07.312
(camera shutters clicking)

14:07.379 --> 14:11.616
(photographers clamoring)

14:18.891 --> 14:21.726
Carl carlson, it is
good to meet you.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.294
Thank you, um...

14:23.362 --> 14:26.130
French nuclear commissioner
etienne ducharme.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.532
Commissioner ducharme,

14:27.600 --> 14:29.467
I trust that
your wife is, uh...

14:29.535 --> 14:31.369
(whispering)
...Still dead?

14:31.437 --> 14:33.738
Yes, thank you for asking.

14:37.042 --> 14:40.511
Monsieur carlson, what have
you enjoyed most about paris?

14:40.579 --> 14:42.180
Oh, I really love, uh...

14:42.247 --> 14:44.315
(whispering)
the louvre.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.017
Everything about it
is so, uh...

14:46.085 --> 14:48.186
(whispers)
closed on mondays.

14:48.253 --> 14:50.321
You are clearly
a man of the world.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.156
May I have your card?

14:52.224 --> 14:53.524
My assistant
will give you that.

14:53.592 --> 14:54.892
Can we meet for lunch?

14:54.960 --> 14:56.294
My assistant
will set that up.

14:56.362 --> 14:57.962
I want to make love, now!

14:58.030 --> 15:01.733
My assistant will do a sensual
dance for your arousal.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.368
Come on, come on, come on,
sensual dance, chop, chop.

15:03.435 --> 15:04.569
Uh, okay.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.472
(humming)

15:11.910 --> 15:13.378
(laughing)

15:13.445 --> 15:16.080
(giggling)

15:16.148 --> 15:17.382
I love paris.

15:17.449 --> 15:18.850
The women, the wine!

15:18.917 --> 15:22.353
Everything except their lame-o
version of rock and roll.

15:22.421 --> 15:26.157
¶ rock and roll,
rock and roll! ¶

15:26.225 --> 15:27.759
¶ rock and roll! ¶

15:27.826 --> 15:29.327
When we get back to the hotel,

15:29.395 --> 15:30.895
I want you to extend our stay.

15:30.963 --> 15:32.397
Indefinitely.

15:32.464 --> 15:34.632
But I have to get
back to marge.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.635
Homer, we are this close
to selling our power in paris,

15:37.703 --> 15:40.705
Milan, dubai, everywhere
people know good electricity.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.007
But we gotta focus!

15:43.075 --> 15:44.609
Monsieur carl!

15:44.677 --> 15:47.145
Let us stroll down
main street euro-disney!

15:47.212 --> 15:50.214
(both laughing)

15:50.282 --> 15:53.084
¶ le sexy rock and roll,
the films of claude chabrol ¶

15:53.152 --> 15:56.020
¶ ooh la la, c'est dommage
everybody eat fromage! ¶

16:11.737 --> 16:14.505
¶ ¶

16:18.210 --> 16:20.878
(siren wailing)

16:20.946 --> 16:27.251
(marge as siren):
Homie! Homie! Homie!
Homie! Homie!

16:27.319 --> 16:28.386
(voice trails off):
Homie!

16:30.055 --> 16:32.090
You two are going out?

16:32.157 --> 16:33.758
I thought I told you

16:33.826 --> 16:35.860
The flanderses were
coming over to dinner.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.229
Sorry, I have a tea
party at janey's.

16:38.297 --> 16:39.731
And I'm having
a stink bomb party

16:39.798 --> 16:41.032
At the house
next to janey's.

16:41.100 --> 16:42.633
No connection.

16:42.701 --> 16:46.170
Hmm, I guess it'll
just be dinner for four.

16:46.238 --> 16:47.338
(doorbell ringing)

16:49.141 --> 16:50.308
Hi, ned.

16:50.375 --> 16:51.576
Where are the boys?

16:51.643 --> 16:53.111
Oh, they're grounded.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.179
I found out rod watched a
commercial for "grey's anatomy,"

16:55.247 --> 16:56.848
And todd took
a full day to tell me.

17:05.022 --> 17:07.657
It's fun to cook
dinner together.

17:07.726 --> 17:10.694
Homer and I never
do it anymore.

17:10.762 --> 17:13.731
Cook together, that is.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.967
What's the next task
on the old I-dinnerary?

17:16.034 --> 17:18.069
You could wash
this iceberg lettuce.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.972
Oh!
Oh!

17:21.039 --> 17:24.407
¶ ¶

17:24.476 --> 17:25.376
(gasping)

17:29.081 --> 17:30.982
Ooh!

17:31.049 --> 17:32.183
Oh...

17:32.251 --> 17:33.251
(organ plays)

17:33.318 --> 17:34.619
Oh...

17:35.921 --> 17:38.089
(both moaning ecstatically)

17:43.345 --> 17:44.412
<i>(panting)</i>

17:44.479 --> 17:46.113
<i>Marge:
Gosh, what a hunk!</i>

17:46.181 --> 17:47.581
<i>Flanders:
I'm not thinking straight.</i>

17:47.649 --> 17:49.417
<i>Why did I drink that
wine cooler last month?</i>

17:49.484 --> 17:50.751
(oven bell dings)

17:50.819 --> 17:52.586
Dinner's ready!
Dinner's ready!

17:52.654 --> 17:55.222
Saved by the bell
from eternity in hell.

17:55.290 --> 17:57.525
(nervous giggling)

17:57.592 --> 17:59.493
(phone ringing)

17:59.561 --> 18:01.629
<i>(whines) bonjour.</i>

18:01.697 --> 18:02.863
Homer, there is a moth
in my room!

18:02.931 --> 18:04.231
Where are you?

18:04.299 --> 18:06.267
Where I should've been
all along.

18:06.334 --> 18:07.868
In springfield.

18:07.936 --> 18:09.103
What?! Homer!

18:09.171 --> 18:11.238
Return to the immortal
city of light at once,

18:11.306 --> 18:12.573
Or you're fired!

18:12.641 --> 18:14.809
Oh, I don't think so.

18:14.876 --> 18:15.843
You know that woman
you've been playing

18:15.911 --> 18:17.211
"hide the baguette" with?

18:17.279 --> 18:19.547
She's the first lady
of France, carla bruni!

18:21.149 --> 18:23.951
If you fire me,
I'll call president sarkozy,

18:24.019 --> 18:25.920
And he'll be all over you
like truffaut on hitchcock.

18:25.987 --> 18:27.888
You wouldn't dare!

18:27.956 --> 18:29.423
Oh, wouldn't I?

18:29.491 --> 18:30.658
Just listen.

18:30.726 --> 18:32.893
(speed-dialing tone)

18:32.961 --> 18:35.362
(phone buzzing)

18:35.430 --> 18:38.432
Hello, you are getting
cozy with sarkozy.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.701
Uh... Okay, okay, you win.

18:40.769 --> 18:42.269
Give my best to marge.

18:42.337 --> 18:43.637
I sure will.

18:43.705 --> 18:47.007
But only after I give her mine.

18:51.146 --> 18:54.014
Nuclear secrets,
pictures of lenny.

18:54.082 --> 18:56.417
Everything I need for my plan!

18:57.652 --> 19:00.087
Marge, that dinner
was a winner!

19:00.155 --> 19:01.255
What's for dessert?

19:01.323 --> 19:03.057
Oh, nothing fancy.

19:03.125 --> 19:04.658
Just strawberries
and whipped cream.

19:09.264 --> 19:12.433
Mmm-mm!

19:13.335 --> 19:16.003
Mmm-mm-mm!

19:19.374 --> 19:21.275
(slurping)

19:21.343 --> 19:23.077
Mmm...

19:23.145 --> 19:25.279
(gasps and giggles)

19:25.347 --> 19:27.181
Mmm...

19:27.249 --> 19:30.184
Ned, you got whipped cream
in your mustache.

19:30.252 --> 19:34.388
Your perfectly
trimmed mustache.

19:38.026 --> 19:40.661
Oh, ned, there's
only one man

19:40.729 --> 19:42.930
I should be eating
whipped cream with.

19:42.998 --> 19:44.965
I never thought otherwise.

19:45.033 --> 19:47.935
Well, see you around
the mailbox, marge.

19:50.172 --> 19:51.572
My wife?

19:51.640 --> 19:53.407
And my worst friend?

19:53.475 --> 19:54.909
Could it be?

19:54.976 --> 19:56.811
(growling)

19:56.878 --> 19:58.345
Nah!

19:58.413 --> 20:01.715
Homie, you're back!

20:01.783 --> 20:04.451
Hey, ned.

20:04.519 --> 20:07.421
Marge, I believe we have
a little unfinished business.

20:07.489 --> 20:08.722
Come with me!

20:08.790 --> 20:09.857
Oh!

20:09.925 --> 20:12.393
(moaning)

20:12.460 --> 20:14.428
Oh, baby, oh, baby!

20:14.496 --> 20:17.531
(moaning passionately)

20:17.599 --> 20:19.767
Marge:
Oh, homer!

20:19.835 --> 20:21.402
(shelf rattling, dish breaking)

20:32.681 --> 20:35.249
Boy, that was
worth the wait.

20:35.317 --> 20:37.685
<i>Now, it's my turn
to roll the dice!</i>

20:37.752 --> 20:40.521
Want to kiss them for me?

20:40.589 --> 20:42.523
Uh-huh.
(kisses)

20:42.591 --> 20:43.824
Classic.

20:43.892 --> 20:45.059
