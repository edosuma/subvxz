00:27.330 --> 00:30.458
<i>Kill everyone.</i>

00:30.534 --> 00:34.061
<i>Everyone.</i>

00:34.137 --> 00:36.007
That's what he
taught me.

00:37.974 --> 00:41.466
No time for doubts, no time for
hesitation, no time for feelings,

00:41.545 --> 00:44.241
no time for friends,
no time for family.

00:44.314 --> 00:48.375
The only way
you can make sure

00:48.451 --> 00:52.148
you won't be betrayed, is
to kill everyone around you.

00:53.990 --> 00:56.823
"Everyone must
die," he said.

00:56.893 --> 00:58.827
"Everyone."

01:00.797 --> 01:04.563
So, you know, that
story you heard about me,

01:04.634 --> 01:06.295
it's a true story.

01:08.471 --> 01:10.371
Got it.

01:11.575 --> 01:13.805
Let's talk about
my business.

01:15.345 --> 01:18.143
I have two associates.
They just got indicted.

01:20.083 --> 01:22.313
They end up
serving high time.

01:22.385 --> 01:25.479
These two <i>ratas</i> are
gonna give my ass up.

01:25.555 --> 01:29.491
I could take care of these two
<i>pinche cabrones</i> myself.

01:29.559 --> 01:33.256
But they got the
block on them 24/7.

01:33.330 --> 01:36.697
Because your fucking DA
has a hard on for me.

01:37.601 --> 01:40.502
He's your boy, huh?

01:40.570 --> 01:42.435
You lean on him.

01:42.505 --> 01:45.497
Make this
indictment go away.

01:45.575 --> 01:47.975
No.

01:48.044 --> 01:49.306
What?

01:49.379 --> 01:53.179
<i>No. I am done</i>
<i>calling in favors</i>

01:53.250 --> 01:56.549
<i>to keep certain animals</i>
<i>out of the joint.</i>

01:56.620 --> 02:00.784
You run a fucked up
operation, Ernesto.

02:01.992 --> 02:04.290
Me? Uh-uh.

02:04.361 --> 02:06.693
You deal
with this now.

02:10.133 --> 02:12.795
I'm not fucking
asking you, old man.

02:12.869 --> 02:16.737
You are not taking care
of business, <i>pendejo.</i>

02:16.806 --> 02:19.366
You know what's
a <i>pendejo,</i> right?

02:21.978 --> 02:24.105
It's a pubic hair.

02:24.180 --> 02:26.944
Now, I don't have to listen
to a fucking thing you say.

02:27.017 --> 02:31.010
Because if I want to, I will drag
this fucking DA out of his house,

02:31.087 --> 02:33.078
put him on his
fucking front lawn

02:33.156 --> 02:34.919
and I will cut
his <i>huevos</i> off.

02:34.991 --> 02:37.289
Watch your step, Ernie.

02:38.328 --> 02:40.125
You're crossing
the line.

02:40.196 --> 02:41.754
Fuck the line!

02:41.831 --> 02:44.095
What are you gonna
do, old man?

02:51.007 --> 02:52.804
Raina.

02:54.644 --> 02:56.839
My, my God!

02:58.548 --> 03:00.311
Raina.

03:59.909 --> 04:02.639
I love you.

04:02.712 --> 04:04.441
I love you.

04:11.688 --> 04:14.122
Go, guys. Let's
move this thing out.

04:15.725 --> 04:18.091
I told you he's not
going anywhere without me.

04:18.161 --> 04:19.856
Let him go.
Go, go.

04:22.766 --> 04:24.757
Go, go!

04:27.270 --> 04:31.036
<i>This is Debra Moran reporting
live from a private men's health club</i>

04:31.107 --> 04:32.836
<i>In downtown</i>
<i>Los Angeles.</i>

04:32.909 --> 04:35.776
<i>LAPD believe that tonight's
murders of two crime bosses</i>

04:35.845 --> 04:39.440
<i>are part of an ongoing power struggle
between a Greek crime syndicate</i>

04:39.516 --> 04:42.212
<i>and a Mexican</i>
<i>drug cartel.</i>

04:42.285 --> 04:43.684
What's up?

04:43.753 --> 04:46.415
Let's hope this isn't the
start of World War III.

04:46.489 --> 04:47.979
Is my girl in there?

04:54.664 --> 04:56.393
Do you know him?

04:56.466 --> 04:58.957
<i>Ernesto Jimenez.</i>
<i>MS 13.</i>

04:59.035 --> 05:01.230
This is fucking
Bentley outside.

05:01.304 --> 05:04.501
<i>DA just came down hard on
him and his whole crew.</i>

05:04.574 --> 05:07.168
And the second vic, the one
they wheeled out of here?

05:07.243 --> 05:10.610
Virgil Vadalos, the Greek.
Gutted like a fish.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.841
They say he died
in the ambulance.

05:14.217 --> 05:16.185
<i>Those two. Can</i>
<i>you believe it?</i>

05:16.252 --> 05:17.685
<i>Check this out.</i>

05:17.754 --> 05:19.745
Looks like they had
a lady with them.

05:19.823 --> 05:21.984
<i>The perp was</i>
<i>a female.</i>

05:22.058 --> 05:25.186
I'll wait to hear from the
lab, but I don't think so.

05:25.261 --> 05:27.024
Erni was a spinal
decapitation.

05:27.097 --> 05:28.962
The knife went all
the way to the bone.

05:29.032 --> 05:31.762
<i>It will have to be one</i>
<i>pretty strong female.</i>

05:38.041 --> 05:39.201
Thank you.

05:39.275 --> 05:40.742
Thank you.

05:40.810 --> 05:42.903
And a carton of Malboros.

05:46.349 --> 05:47.714
ID, please.

05:47.784 --> 05:49.877
Just give me my fags,
for fuck's sake.

05:49.953 --> 05:51.648
I need to see
and ID.

05:51.721 --> 05:55.555
How do you like if people fucking
ask for your papers, Osama? Huh?

05:57.727 --> 06:02.187
Look, I ask for an ID because
you look like 12 years old.

06:02.265 --> 06:03.630
Really?

06:04.567 --> 06:07.229
Twelve you say?

06:07.303 --> 06:10.704
How do these look for
a 12-year old? Yeah?

06:10.773 --> 06:12.673
I think you
better leave now.

06:14.043 --> 06:16.409
Get the fuck out of my store.
Right now!

06:17.580 --> 06:18.877
Get out!

06:18.948 --> 06:21.348
All right.

06:23.586 --> 06:26.680
Try and touch my tits again,
you fucking fagot.

06:44.174 --> 06:45.835
Hey!

06:47.577 --> 06:49.010
Get in the car.

06:51.414 --> 06:53.507
Tried to touch my tits.

06:53.583 --> 06:57.041
The last thing we need is the
heat coming down on us right now.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.382
<i>Yeah?</i>

07:01.457 --> 07:03.891
<i>Who is it we were</i>
<i>looking for, Papa?</i>

07:03.960 --> 07:06.326
Why do you gotta
bust my balls?

07:06.396 --> 07:08.387
You're such
a little cunt.

07:08.464 --> 07:10.955
Yeah? Well, I'm
your little cunt.

07:18.708 --> 07:20.767
You fucking
piece of ass.

07:20.843 --> 07:22.640
God help me.

07:33.623 --> 07:35.090
What are you doing?

07:35.158 --> 07:36.250
I'm changing.

07:36.326 --> 07:37.350
What?

07:37.427 --> 07:39.418
That silly cunt called me 12.

07:39.495 --> 07:41.656
Oh, for Christ's sake.

07:53.610 --> 07:56.511
Hey, detective.
Remember me?

07:56.579 --> 07:57.876
You look good.

07:57.947 --> 07:59.414
I know.

07:59.482 --> 08:01.882
I guess London was a
good move for you then.

08:01.951 --> 08:04.351
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

08:04.420 --> 08:07.355
<i>A little souvenir I
<i>picked up in Heathrow.</i></i>

08:09.826 --> 08:12.624
Is that you?
Hemi?

08:12.695 --> 08:13.787
Yeah.

08:13.863 --> 08:15.330
Nice.

08:15.398 --> 08:18.265
Listen. About Virgil,
what can I say?

08:18.334 --> 08:20.962
How's Sylvia taken it?
The kids, I mean?

08:21.037 --> 08:25.235
The whole thing was very
upsetting for them. For all of us.

08:25.308 --> 08:27.776
Listen, detective,
you need to come by the house.

08:27.844 --> 08:28.868
I will.

08:28.945 --> 08:30.970
I mean now.

08:31.047 --> 08:32.275
I'm on the job.

08:32.347 --> 08:34.212
Detective, you need
to come by the house.

08:34.284 --> 08:36.275
That's why I'm here.
To drive you there.

08:36.352 --> 08:38.183
You can either
come with me,

08:40.222 --> 08:42.087
or you can follow me.

09:33.743 --> 09:35.734
Woo-hoo!

10:13.750 --> 10:15.081
What took you?

10:15.151 --> 10:16.778
Told ya I should've driven.
You fucking pussy.

10:16.853 --> 10:18.252
Shut up and wait
in the car.

10:18.321 --> 10:20.289
What are you talking about?
I'm going with ya.

10:20.356 --> 10:21.516
No, you're not.

10:21.591 --> 10:23.286
You said you
sorted this out.

10:23.359 --> 10:25.156
<i>Shut up and stay</i>
<i>in the fucking car.</i>

10:25.228 --> 10:26.354
Fuck sake.

10:26.429 --> 10:27.896
She seems like
a nice kid.

10:27.964 --> 10:29.727
Fuck you, too.
Come on.

10:45.848 --> 10:47.281
Stay here.

10:50.219 --> 10:52.414
What?

10:52.488 --> 10:54.513
Just go.

11:12.742 --> 11:14.505
Jesus Christ.

11:17.447 --> 11:19.745
No, no.

11:19.816 --> 11:23.445
He took three days.
I beat his record.

11:32.128 --> 11:33.561
Ouzo?

11:33.629 --> 11:34.994
No, thanks.

11:35.064 --> 11:39.057
<i>My lifestyle. That's</i>
<i>what saved my life.</i>

11:40.770 --> 11:43.034
If I were 100-pound
weakling, I'd be dead.

11:43.105 --> 11:45.835
I saw it coming. She's
a fucking bloodsucker.

11:49.879 --> 11:52.109
<i>This is who I
<i>want you to find.</i></i>

11:54.417 --> 11:58.649
Her name is,
uh, Raina Mavias.

11:58.721 --> 12:01.315
<i>Russian. In
<i>country Illegally.</i></i>

12:01.390 --> 12:04.120
<i>I set her up</i>
<i>real good.</i>

12:04.193 --> 12:08.596
<i>She was living with this "has
been" Hollywood producer.</i>

12:08.664 --> 12:11.292
<i>All strung-out</i>
<i>doing tricks.</i>

12:11.367 --> 12:13.767
<i>I don't want you to
share this information.</i>

12:16.005 --> 12:17.973
Not with the cops.

12:18.040 --> 12:20.235
I don't give a shit
about your investigation.

12:20.309 --> 12:22.971
I want you to find her.
Not the Police.

12:23.045 --> 12:24.512
What are you
talking about?

12:24.580 --> 12:28.346
As far as the Police
are concerned, I saw nothing.

12:28.417 --> 12:30.783
<i>You go find her and
bring her to me directly.</i>

12:30.853 --> 12:33.754
This is a murder case, not a
speeding ticket. I can't do that.

12:33.823 --> 12:35.984
You can and you will.

12:41.497 --> 12:43.431
I can't do this.

12:43.499 --> 12:49.301
Let me ask you something. You still
getting those postcards from your brother?

12:49.372 --> 12:52.967
You know, I remember when
your brother got in trouble.

12:53.042 --> 12:56.136
He seemed to make a lot
of enemies, didn't he?

12:57.246 --> 12:59.612
He's looked after
real well.

13:04.353 --> 13:05.980
Why are you going
through all this?

13:06.055 --> 13:08.717
I don't need a reason.

13:08.791 --> 13:10.486
And neither do you.

13:14.931 --> 13:16.728
Fucking shit.

13:37.386 --> 13:38.444
Ah!

13:38.521 --> 13:40.853
Hey.

13:42.024 --> 13:43.753
Hi.

13:43.826 --> 13:45.589
Hey, <i>tio.</i>

13:47.396 --> 13:49.364
<i>You know my cousin</i>
<i>Alex, don't you?</i>

13:49.432 --> 13:51.662
Hi, Detective Beck.
Long time no see.

13:51.734 --> 13:53.725
How is the LAPD
treating you?

13:53.803 --> 13:55.293
Great.

14:08.618 --> 14:11.485
Why does he got that
monkey handling this thing?

14:11.554 --> 14:14.523
He knows he
won't hurt her.

14:15.324 --> 14:16.518
Like I would.

14:21.964 --> 14:26.458
What? Am I missing something
here? Virgil say something to you?

14:26.535 --> 14:30.596
Look, isn't that sweet?
The pit bull.

14:30.673 --> 14:33.642
Got himself a
little pit bull.

14:33.709 --> 14:36.803
<i>Hey, you wanna go</i>
<i>for a walk, poochy?</i>

14:39.782 --> 14:41.306
Oh, the Greek way, huh?

14:41.384 --> 14:42.908
Listen to me.

14:42.985 --> 14:46.648
The only reason you got this
job is because I went away.

14:46.722 --> 14:48.417
You remember that.

14:48.491 --> 14:50.049
Is that right?

14:50.126 --> 14:52.060
Yeah, that's right.

14:52.128 --> 14:55.393
Then it's good for me
you went away, huh?

15:00.936 --> 15:04.895
You take it easy. You're going
to, you're going to hurt yourself.

15:07.510 --> 15:11.947
<i>Hey, Lee, you know it's Illegal to
keep your dog in the car llke that</i>

15:12.014 --> 15:15.108
with the windows rolled up.
She might get heat exhaustion.

15:15.184 --> 15:16.913
Fuck you!

15:16.986 --> 15:19.011
<i>Fuck you, too, poochy.</i>

15:24.593 --> 15:26.390
Careful.

15:26.462 --> 15:29.090
Fuck you.

16:01.764 --> 16:04.028
Listen to me, you
little cocksucker.

16:04.100 --> 16:06.967
You owe me money,
you got it?

16:07.036 --> 16:10.403
<i>Pay me today or die.</i>
<i>You understand?</i>

16:37.933 --> 16:41.027
<i>I made the driver's</i>
<i>license for her.</i>

16:41.103 --> 16:43.162
When?

16:43.239 --> 16:46.208
Uh, about, uh, six months.

16:46.275 --> 16:49.836
Maybe a year ago.
The guy paid for it.

16:49.912 --> 16:51.470
What did he look like?

16:51.547 --> 16:54.277
I don't know. I try to forget
the people who come in here.

16:54.350 --> 16:55.647
Tough guy?
White hair?

16:55.718 --> 16:57.379
Normal!

16:57.453 --> 16:58.977
Hey, Mo.

17:04.993 --> 17:06.894
Listen, man.

17:06.962 --> 17:09.156
This motherfucker
put my uncle in jail.

17:09.231 --> 17:11.756
<i>I recognized him.</i>

17:18.240 --> 17:19.707
My, uh,

17:21.644 --> 17:23.907

tells me, uh,

17:25.580 --> 17:29.381
you send the Feds to his
cousin in the restaurant.

17:30.419 --> 17:32.580
They sent him
to prison.

17:32.655 --> 17:34.987
Who the girl
come in here with?

17:35.057 --> 17:36.991
Frank Sinatra.

17:37.059 --> 17:40.426
Okay. One, I'm a cop.
Two, I have a gun on me.

17:48.237 --> 17:52.435
I got you and take for three
fucker years buying and selling.

17:52.508 --> 17:53.600
Now, get out!

17:53.676 --> 17:55.906
Fucking stupid, Mo.

17:55.978 --> 18:00.039
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

18:06.589 --> 18:07.749
Hey.

18:07.823 --> 18:09.518
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

18:09.592 --> 18:10.923
Yeah?

18:11.827 --> 18:13.522
Can you hook me up?

18:13.596 --> 18:16.622
Can I hook you up?
Yeah? You wanna party?

18:16.699 --> 18:17.961
Oh, yeah?

18:18.033 --> 18:19.694
Can we go
somewhere private?

18:19.768 --> 18:21.099
Sure.

18:21.170 --> 18:23.900
I know a place
really private.

18:26.709 --> 18:29.177
I'm so fucked up.

18:30.012 --> 18:32.310
Oh.

18:32.381 --> 18:34.372
I can hear
your heart beat.

18:34.450 --> 18:35.815
Yeah?

18:35.885 --> 18:37.443
You have a tattoo.

18:37.519 --> 18:39.282
Oh, yeah.

18:39.355 --> 18:41.983
Oh, I love tattoos.

18:42.057 --> 18:45.891
Yeah? You wanna
see more of them?

18:49.064 --> 18:51.032
Can I make one?

18:52.134 --> 18:54.159
Can I make it right

18:56.672 --> 18:58.537
here?

19:10.819 --> 19:13.617
Don't take this
the wrong way,

19:13.689 --> 19:16.351
but you're pretty hot
for a crack whore.

19:23.732 --> 19:25.597
Wait a minute.

19:26.969 --> 19:27.993
I think...

19:28.971 --> 19:31.098
I think I know you.

19:31.173 --> 19:35.041
Maybe you remember
someone who looks like me.

20:32.267 --> 20:34.428
You were right.
Suspect's a woman.

20:34.503 --> 20:38.064
The surveillance video from the bath
house got a glimpse of her leaving.

20:38.140 --> 20:40.734
Didn't get a clear shot
of her face though.

20:40.809 --> 20:42.401
<i>The bride of Dracula.</i>

20:42.478 --> 20:45.970
All right. Get these to Jay.
See if he can enhance them.

20:46.048 --> 20:47.743
And then, uh, get
them on the wire.

20:47.816 --> 20:51.252
I am so glad you're here, 'cause
I never would've thought of that.

20:51.320 --> 20:53.117
What's this
guy's story?

20:53.188 --> 20:56.214
Priors up the ass.
Possession with intent,

20:56.291 --> 20:58.259
assault, armed robbery.

20:58.327 --> 21:02.093
Guy runs with a bunch of
clowns called Nazis for Jesus.

21:02.164 --> 21:02.823
That's nice.

21:10.172 --> 21:12.606
This ain't about
that airport thing, is it?

21:12.674 --> 21:14.972
I told you. I already
looked into that.

21:15.044 --> 21:17.569
I checked it up personally.
There's nothing to it.

21:17.646 --> 21:19.477
Something.

21:19.548 --> 21:21.641
Something poisoned
her against me.

21:23.152 --> 21:27.054
Listen, maybe there is
no big mystery to this.

21:27.122 --> 21:30.819
A woman like that. She was
brought up with nothing,

21:30.893 --> 21:35.193
watching her family
live like rats over there.

21:35.264 --> 21:37.960
That shit gets inside
of you and never leaves,

21:38.033 --> 21:40.729
and never gonna
be normal. Never!

21:45.908 --> 21:48.536
No, no.
Mh-mh.

21:49.645 --> 21:52.113
I saw her eyes
that night.

21:53.916 --> 21:55.440
Mh-mh.

21:55.517 --> 21:57.815
It wasn't greed.

21:57.886 --> 22:01.686
I know greed. I used to see
it in the mirror every day.

22:05.260 --> 22:07.251
I see it now
when I look at you.

22:13.502 --> 22:16.300
No. It wasn't greed.

22:18.774 --> 22:20.401
It was hate.

22:21.643 --> 22:23.577
Pure and simple.

22:29.351 --> 22:31.114
Yeah.

22:31.186 --> 22:34.485
<i> We got trouble. I'm at
the warehouse. Bring Virgil.</i>

22:34.556 --> 22:36.990
It's Lee.
We have to go.

22:37.059 --> 22:39.619
Wooh! Go on.
Mac, hit him harder!

22:39.695 --> 22:42.129
Hit him like
you're fucking mad.

22:42.197 --> 22:43.789
Give it to him.
One more.

22:47.703 --> 22:52.333
Don't quit on me...
We've only just started.

22:52.407 --> 22:56.138
<i>Danny Boy, you can</i>
<i>take a beating. I give you that.</i>

22:58.447 --> 23:01.314
It's 'cause I got nothing
to tell you, Lee.

23:01.383 --> 23:03.214
Come on, think about it.

23:03.285 --> 23:06.482
Do you think I could take all this if
I didn't have something to give you?

23:06.555 --> 23:08.352
I got no idea where
that money is, man.

23:08.423 --> 23:12.325
Come on. You gotta start
looking a little closer to home.

23:14.163 --> 23:16.495
I hope you're wrong.

23:16.565 --> 23:19.466
But I'll find out
sooner or later.

23:21.436 --> 23:23.267
The problem
for you is that

23:25.240 --> 23:26.571
you're the sooner.

23:45.027 --> 23:46.858
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

23:46.929 --> 23:49.295
Lee, don't. Lee, look at me.
Look at me!

23:49.364 --> 23:50.626
Give me that.

23:50.699 --> 23:53.099
I don't have it.
I don't have it.

23:53.168 --> 23:56.069
I don't know where it is.
Lee. Lee, listen.

23:56.138 --> 23:59.596
Look, babe. Bloke's a romantic.
Look at his tattoo.

23:59.675 --> 24:02.041
No. Hey, hey, look at me.
Look at me.

24:02.110 --> 24:03.907
<i>Hey. You don't</i>
<i>have to do that.</i>

24:03.979 --> 24:05.947
<i>Look at me.</i>
<i>Hey, hey.</i>

24:06.014 --> 24:09.211
You don't have to, you don't
have to do it. Look at me. Hey.

24:09.284 --> 24:10.945
<i>No, no, no,</i>
<i>no, no no no.</i>

24:11.019 --> 24:12.418
No!

24:26.501 --> 24:29.937
Virgil! Get this crazy
freak out of here.

24:30.005 --> 24:32.200
He's out of
his fucking mind!

24:34.443 --> 24:36.070
Shit.

24:39.815 --> 24:41.840
Virgil.

24:43.018 --> 24:45.612
What the fuck
are you doing here?

24:46.855 --> 24:49.016
What?

24:49.091 --> 24:51.116
Animals.

24:52.928 --> 24:54.862
Sh.

24:54.930 --> 25:00.630
Get that psychotic
Cockney bitch out of here now.

25:00.702 --> 25:02.465
Whatever.

25:02.537 --> 25:04.061
Get out.

25:04.806 --> 25:06.103
Lee...

25:06.174 --> 25:08.540
Get out now!

25:08.610 --> 25:10.134
You fucking psycho.

25:15.951 --> 25:17.976
The money's gone.

25:18.053 --> 25:19.680
<i>$2 million worth.</i>

25:20.856 --> 25:22.289
Who knew we had cash here?

25:22.357 --> 25:24.723
You and Gus.

25:24.793 --> 25:27.318
And him!

25:27.396 --> 25:29.193
And what's left of this fuck.

25:29.264 --> 25:31.164
Uh, I...

25:32.134 --> 25:33.726
And you?

25:33.802 --> 25:35.235
Yeah, and me.

25:36.438 --> 25:38.030
He admit to it?

25:38.106 --> 25:39.232
No.

25:39.308 --> 25:43.301
No. But I never
trusted this fuck.

25:43.378 --> 25:45.141
No.

25:46.348 --> 25:49.977
Let me ask you
something, Lee.

25:50.052 --> 25:52.748
Why did Danny Boy stick around?
Why didn't he just run?

25:52.821 --> 25:54.880
The fuck do I now!
He's a fucking moron!

25:54.956 --> 25:56.218
Let him talk.

25:56.291 --> 25:59.226
Get this crazy fuck off me.
He'll kill me.

25:59.294 --> 26:02.661
Danny Boy.
Danny Boy.

26:04.433 --> 26:06.731
He, look, you gotta
believe me, Virgil.

26:06.802 --> 26:10.431
I would never, never. I did
not touch the money. I swear.

26:10.505 --> 26:12.097
Who did then?

26:12.174 --> 26:14.608
That sick cocksucker.

26:14.676 --> 26:18.669
<i>He's been talking shit ever since he got back.
Says nobody gives him any respect.</i>

26:18.747 --> 26:22.706
You lying, piece of shit!
I'll cut your head!

26:22.784 --> 26:24.479
Lee!

26:26.121 --> 26:28.385
I came down here looking
for out-of-state tags.

26:28.457 --> 26:30.982
The fucking safe
was cleared out.

26:33.595 --> 26:37.156
It was him. It was him and
that crazy Russian whore.

26:37.232 --> 26:39.393
The one who cut you.
They set you up.

26:39.468 --> 26:42.494
<i>He's been trying</i>
<i>to nail her ever since.</i>

26:47.242 --> 26:48.732
Say that again.

26:48.810 --> 26:52.268
That crazy whore, Raina.
She probably sucked his cock.

26:52.347 --> 26:53.814
Shut up!

26:53.882 --> 26:56.749
He told her the money was here.
That's what fucking...

27:09.798 --> 27:13.859
I swore I would
not do this again.

27:15.303 --> 27:17.737
Give me the gun.
I'll take care of it.

27:49.771 --> 27:51.534
Fuck are you looking at?

27:54.409 --> 27:56.377
Garbage.

28:55.837 --> 28:57.702
Raina?

28:57.772 --> 28:59.831
Hello, Nancy.

28:59.908 --> 29:02.103
Oh, my God.

29:02.177 --> 29:03.940
You look so different.

29:04.012 --> 29:06.913
Look at you.

29:10.986 --> 29:12.419
Can I touch it?

29:12.487 --> 29:14.284
Yeah.

29:18.894 --> 29:20.759
It's amazing.

29:27.202 --> 29:29.534
Don't you think
you should just

29:29.604 --> 29:32.232
disappear somewhere?
I mean...

29:33.742 --> 29:34.766
Isn't this enough?

29:34.843 --> 29:38.244
How much is
enough, Nancy?

29:38.313 --> 29:40.804
I really didn't mean it that way.
I just...

29:42.851 --> 29:47.311
I just worry about you. I don't
want anything to happen to you.

30:01.169 --> 30:02.796
Raina, no.

30:02.871 --> 30:06.967
If you didn't come to me,
I would've never found out about it.

30:07.909 --> 30:10.434
They all have to pay.

30:11.279 --> 30:13.372
But not to me.

30:13.448 --> 30:15.916
This money
is from me.

30:15.984 --> 30:18.953
It doesn't matter
where I got it.

30:19.020 --> 30:22.012
You won't see me
after today.

30:22.090 --> 30:23.148
Raina.

30:23.224 --> 30:26.022
You are my sister now.

30:27.429 --> 30:30.626
And you are going to be
a beautiful mother.

30:39.674 --> 30:42.040
<i>Still looking on the black widow.</i>

30:42.444 --> 30:45.470
But we can establish direct
links between two of the victims.

30:45.547 --> 30:46.878
Yeah.

30:46.948 --> 30:50.213
Krieger the Nazi,
he was busted six years ago

30:50.285 --> 30:53.277
for selling roids
for Ernesto Jimenez.

30:53.355 --> 30:55.482
I'll look into that.
Don't worry about it.

30:55.557 --> 30:58.424
You know, it's funny.
Somehow I thought that Vadalos' name

30:58.493 --> 31:00.893
would be tied into all of this.
But still nothing.

31:00.962 --> 31:02.987
Yeah, that is funny.

31:19.481 --> 31:20.812
So.

31:22.784 --> 31:24.809
What the fuck did
you do to your wrist?

31:27.722 --> 31:30.987
You're the only boss and knows
what he's doing around here.

31:31.059 --> 31:33.755
And you let Virgil treat
you like you're fucking scum.

31:35.397 --> 31:37.228
It's how it is.

31:38.867 --> 31:41.768
I've been away for a while.
I gotta work my way back.

31:41.836 --> 31:44.737
You really think he's gonna
let you work your way back?

31:44.806 --> 31:48.867
He thinks you took that money,
Lee. He doesn't even trust you.

31:56.451 --> 31:57.918
Yeah.

31:58.853 --> 32:00.844
It's done.

32:00.922 --> 32:04.187
No. Nobody's
ever gonna find him.

32:04.259 --> 32:06.489
All right.
I'm on my way.

32:06.561 --> 32:09.553
No. No, she's
dropping me off.

32:10.565 --> 32:12.294
Dropping me off?

32:12.367 --> 32:15.962
Like I was a little fucking lap dog?
I'm not going fucking anywhere.

32:16.037 --> 32:18.005
You think you're better than me?
Do you?

32:18.073 --> 32:20.371
You forget what you were doing
when I first met you?

32:20.442 --> 32:22.103
Fuck you for throwing
it at my face.

32:22.177 --> 32:24.839
I do what I have to do to survive,
because assholes like you

32:24.913 --> 32:27.040
have been fucking me
since I was 9 years old.

32:27.115 --> 32:28.980
And you enjoyed
every minute of it.

32:29.918 --> 32:31.249
Fucking...

32:38.026 --> 32:41.553
I'm sorry.
That was a stupid thing to say.

32:46.568 --> 32:48.433
I'm sorry.

33:08.723 --> 33:11.157
<i>So, you're saying</i>
<i>we were contacted by aliens?</i>

33:11.226 --> 33:12.818
<i>Yes.</i>

33:15.396 --> 33:18.524
Can we get the fuck
out of here now?

33:18.600 --> 33:20.329
No, it just started.

33:22.237 --> 33:24.171
<i>I have a stronger will.</i>

33:24.239 --> 33:27.800
<i>I don't care how many of them I
have to kill in order to stay alive.</i>

33:27.876 --> 33:30.436
<i>How many of us are left?</i>

33:31.846 --> 33:33.313
What the fuck?

33:33.381 --> 33:35.372
I'm so, so sorry.

33:35.450 --> 33:37.042
What is your problem?

33:37.118 --> 33:38.483
I can clean this up.

33:38.553 --> 33:41.954
Don't touch me!
You better no. You stay there.

33:42.023 --> 33:43.820
Do you want some Kleenex?

33:43.892 --> 33:45.883
You fuck.

33:45.960 --> 33:48.428
Get the fuck
out of my way, okay?

33:48.496 --> 33:50.691
I'm going to the fucking
ladies' room.

33:53.034 --> 33:55.696
I have some napkins
if she likes.

33:55.770 --> 33:57.863
You're a fucking cunt.

33:57.939 --> 34:00.237
<i> You're gonna be</i>
<i>out there on your own</i>

34:00.308 --> 34:02.367
<i>making life and</i>
<i>death decisions.</i>

34:02.443 --> 34:06.243
<i>You have carte blanch to kill
when you think it's necessary.</i>

34:17.292 --> 34:19.726
<i>Seems you and I
<i>have come full circle.</i></i>

34:19.793 --> 34:22.456
<i>I don't believe</i>
<i>in coincidence, do you?</i>

34:22.530 --> 34:25.158
<i>It's all predestined</i>
<i>everything.</i>

34:25.233 --> 34:28.065
<i>You were the one</i>
<i>in charge hunting me.</i>

34:28.136 --> 34:31.503
<i>Eliminating me</i>
<i>and my kind.</i>

34:35.476 --> 34:37.909
Don't mess
with the Russians.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.074
<i>I cannot wait to see
the look on your face</i>

34:42.150 --> 34:44.744
<i>when you realize what
you've done to your family.</i>

34:45.954 --> 34:48.217
<i>I figured</i>
<i>it out yesterday.</i>

34:48.289 --> 34:53.283
<i>How to survive here.</i>
<i>This absolutely hink of a planet.</i>

35:06.941 --> 35:08.841
Listen to me.

35:08.910 --> 35:12.437
I'm trying to save your life.
Do you understand?

35:14.382 --> 35:16.475
Wait five minutes
before you turn around,

35:16.551 --> 35:19.384
and don't even think about
going back into that theater.

35:19.454 --> 35:21.684
Do you understand?
Just nod your head.

35:23.057 --> 35:24.354
Give me your hand.

35:27.061 --> 35:29.529
Take a long vacation,

35:29.597 --> 35:31.588
and make some
new friends.

35:39.574 --> 35:41.098
Nice tattoo.

36:51.779 --> 36:54.270
I didn't touch
that money.

36:54.349 --> 36:57.682
And I've nothing to do with
that girlfriend of yours.

36:59.087 --> 37:00.782
So, if she
knew about it

37:01.823 --> 37:03.450
and where it was,

37:04.892 --> 37:06.382
I don't know.

37:06.461 --> 37:08.895
<i>But it wasn't me.</i>

37:10.131 --> 37:13.259
You know, I asked you
if you took it.

37:13.334 --> 37:14.733
No, I'm just
thinking out...

37:14.802 --> 37:16.895
Now you're going
on about it.

37:16.971 --> 37:19.098
Maybe I'm wrong.

37:19.173 --> 37:22.939
I... I, maybe I should
just ask you flat-out.

37:23.978 --> 37:25.343
The answer's no.

37:25.413 --> 37:27.142
Oh.

37:31.152 --> 37:33.950
Why are you so fucking
paranoid, Lee, huh?

37:47.735 --> 37:49.726
I don't see Raina.

37:51.272 --> 37:52.603
What are you doing here?

37:52.673 --> 37:54.903
You rather have this
conversation on a cell?

37:54.976 --> 37:57.774
Your girl's not making it easy
to keep the cops off track.

37:57.845 --> 38:00.439
She's been cutting up
her ex-boyfriends.

38:00.515 --> 38:04.042
Those scumbags were known accomplices
who pulled out jobs together.

38:04.118 --> 38:06.484
So she's doing
the cops a favor.

38:06.554 --> 38:09.045
They were connected.

38:09.123 --> 38:12.923
<i>Do you wanna tell me now before my captain
does how these guys are tied to you?</i>

38:12.994 --> 38:16.054
Uh-uh. They have
no ties to me.

38:16.130 --> 38:17.791
They're garbage.

38:17.865 --> 38:19.730
<i>Well, she cut you up</i>
<i>the same as them.</i>

38:19.801 --> 38:22.361
So, in her eyes
you're no different.

38:34.682 --> 38:36.343
How are you?

38:40.188 --> 38:41.485
Wow!

38:41.556 --> 38:42.750
Now we can party, right?

38:42.824 --> 38:44.121
Mr. Molinas.

38:44.192 --> 38:45.819
All right.
C'mon, show me.

38:45.893 --> 38:47.724
Right this way. Chef's
been waiting for you.

38:47.795 --> 38:49.285
Okay. What do we got?

38:49.363 --> 38:50.853
Don't worry.
The best for you.

38:50.932 --> 38:51.990
So, what's best?

38:52.066 --> 38:54.534
We got beef,
some nuggies.

38:54.602 --> 38:55.933
<i>Me gusta.</i>

38:58.906 --> 39:00.430
How's business?

39:00.508 --> 39:02.738
<i> My business is</i>
<i>none of your business.</i>

39:02.810 --> 39:05.574
<i>Right this way.</i>
<i>See? Best table on the house.</i>

39:08.116 --> 39:10.880
<i>So, Mr. Molinas, a <i>bottle of
champagne on the house.</i></i>

39:10.952 --> 39:12.715
A bottle of champagne
on the house?

39:12.787 --> 39:15.415
How about two bottles
of champagne on the house?

39:15.490 --> 39:17.924
The money I spend here.

39:17.992 --> 39:19.482
Hey, I got a joke.

39:46.154 --> 39:47.712
Vadalos.

39:58.833 --> 40:01.700
Put your hands away.
You want them cut off?

40:04.972 --> 40:08.339
Hey. Vadalos.
What's up, man?

40:10.478 --> 40:13.072
Why don't you show some respect?
We're having dinner.

40:13.147 --> 40:17.208
I can see that.
You're sitting here having dinner.

40:17.285 --> 40:20.584
My boy Ernesto is in a fucking slab.
Crazy shit, huh?

40:20.655 --> 40:23.852
Yeah. Ernesto.

40:23.925 --> 40:25.916
He was a real <i>hermano.</i>

40:25.993 --> 40:30.259
<i>But I sent something very
speclal to his wife and kids.</i>

40:30.331 --> 40:34.165
I-I should've delivered it
personally but, as you know, um,

40:34.235 --> 40:37.204
I'm suffering from
injuries myself.

40:37.271 --> 40:40.172
You and I both know that
you took out Ernesto.

40:40.241 --> 40:43.210
But don't ever think you're
gonna fucking get away with it.

40:43.277 --> 40:45.108
You cocksucker!

40:54.789 --> 40:58.122
It's okay, it's okay.
It's okay. Let's go.

40:58.192 --> 40:59.955
<i>Go and get the fuck outta here.</i>

41:12.907 --> 41:14.568
Get the fuck
outta here!

41:15.743 --> 41:17.506
<i>Get the fuck</i>
<i>outta here!</i>

41:17.578 --> 41:20.911
<i>Get the fuck outta
here, you pussies.</i>

41:20.982 --> 41:22.847
<i>We'll be back.</i>

41:34.762 --> 41:36.093
Time to go.

41:38.099 --> 41:41.694
Listen, those clowns puff up
like that. They're coming back.

41:44.572 --> 41:48.064
Look, don't be so stubborn.
I get the car.

42:56.143 --> 42:57.576
Where's the
fucking car?

42:57.645 --> 42:59.203
<i>Let's go. Lee.</i>

43:00.114 --> 43:01.445
Get it here, Alex.

43:01.515 --> 43:02.709
Get in. Get in.

43:06.153 --> 43:08.246
The shotgun, Virgil.
Gimme that shotgun.

43:09.990 --> 43:11.480
<i>What are you doing?</i>

43:11.559 --> 43:14.153
<i>Lee. Hold on. Lee!</i>

43:16.797 --> 43:18.059
<i>Lee!</i>

43:19.567 --> 43:21.000
Hector!

43:21.068 --> 43:22.535
Argh!

43:34.715 --> 43:38.674
<i>C'mon. C'mon!
C'mon. C'mon.</i>

43:38.753 --> 43:40.618
Go. Go!

43:48.662 --> 43:50.562
You got something
on you mind, Lee?

43:50.631 --> 43:52.258
<i>Yeah. You're not</i>
<i>up to this!</i>

43:52.333 --> 43:54.233
Fuck you, cowboy!

43:54.301 --> 43:57.293
<i>This guy should be picking out
uniforms for cocktail waitresses.</i>

43:57.371 --> 43:59.669
Not running an operation
during a time of war!

43:59.740 --> 44:01.139
Listen to him.
"Time of war."

44:01.208 --> 44:03.870
Mr. John Wayne
fucking cowboy!

44:03.944 --> 44:07.436
<i>Hey, when all the guns are pointing in
our direction, that's a fucking war!</i>

44:07.515 --> 44:09.244
The guns are pointed at me.

44:09.316 --> 44:10.442
<i>Same thing!</i>

44:10.518 --> 44:12.008
No, not this time.

44:12.086 --> 44:14.782
What is wrong with you?

44:14.855 --> 44:17.847
We got kids upstairs
trying to sleep.

44:27.768 --> 44:29.030
Okay. Everybody out.

44:58.866 --> 45:00.265
Hello.

45:21.956 --> 45:23.480
It's beautiful.

45:25.326 --> 45:26.759
I love you.

45:27.828 --> 45:29.056
I love you.

46:28.556 --> 46:29.989
Are you ashamed of me?

46:31.759 --> 46:34.990
There's lot more important things
in life than who's fucking who.

46:35.062 --> 46:37.895
Oh, Sylvia.
It's not...

46:37.965 --> 46:40.058
Not important?

46:42.870 --> 46:45.771
No. It's not.

46:46.807 --> 46:49.173
But my family is.

46:53.747 --> 46:55.977
I knew what you were
when I met you.

46:57.251 --> 47:00.015
All I asked for
was your last name.

47:01.288 --> 47:03.756
And you gave it to me.

47:03.824 --> 47:06.952
I have everything.

47:11.231 --> 47:15.361
Yeah. So do I.

47:15.436 --> 47:19.167
So do you. So do you. So do you.
So do you. So do you. So do you.

47:19.239 --> 47:20.604
I hate you.

47:20.674 --> 47:24.474
Of course you have everything.

47:26.180 --> 47:28.444
Everything.

47:28.515 --> 47:30.881
I am nothing.

47:32.753 --> 47:34.721
I'm sorry.

47:34.788 --> 47:36.653
No. No.

47:38.025 --> 47:41.324
I knew what you had
to do to get us here.

47:41.395 --> 47:43.727
I'm not an idiot.

47:43.797 --> 47:46.061
Something happened
to you.

47:46.133 --> 47:48.431
I could justify
that to myself.

47:48.502 --> 47:51.938
To the kids.
You did it for us, right?

47:53.540 --> 47:55.906
But if I lose you

47:58.012 --> 48:00.606
because of this,

48:01.915 --> 48:05.476
how do I justify
that to myself?

48:05.552 --> 48:08.214
How do I tell the kids what
happened to their father?

48:08.288 --> 48:12.315
But this, yes, I would
be ashamed of you.

48:16.964 --> 48:18.056
What?

48:18.132 --> 48:19.156
Give it to me.

48:19.233 --> 48:20.666
I won't give it to you.

48:20.734 --> 48:23.726
Give it to me or I will
break your little fingers.

48:23.804 --> 48:25.897
No, you won't.

48:29.877 --> 48:31.174
Oh.

48:31.245 --> 48:32.337
I love you.

48:32.413 --> 48:34.381
I love you, baby.

48:39.186 --> 48:40.448
<i>Hey.</i>

48:40.521 --> 48:44.013
<i>Oh, God, it's so</i>
<i>cold out here.</i>

48:44.091 --> 48:46.992
Hey, you!
Look at me!

48:47.061 --> 48:48.892
Hey.

48:48.962 --> 48:52.830
If I looked like her, I'd had no
problem finding a place to crash.

48:52.900 --> 48:54.697
Try the Four Seasons.

48:58.672 --> 49:01.470
You wanna cry over
your ex-girlfriend all night?

49:01.542 --> 49:04.102
You wanna let <i>us</i>
take care of you, hm?

49:07.981 --> 49:09.642
Don't move, cocksucker.

49:09.717 --> 49:11.582
You kidding me?

49:11.652 --> 49:14.883
Shut up, pussy. You lucky I don't kill
ya after listening to all that wining.

49:14.955 --> 49:17.014
Get your fucking
hands off me.

49:18.358 --> 49:20.883
Oh, shit!
He's a cop!

49:26.633 --> 49:28.032
<i>Okay.</i>

49:28.102 --> 49:30.764
<i>Okay, okay,</i>
<i>enough, enough.</i>

49:34.208 --> 49:36.142
I know that bitch.

49:37.344 --> 49:40.370
I think you broke
my fucking nose.

49:40.447 --> 49:43.507
I've seen her once.
She's with this guy.

49:43.584 --> 49:46.178
Who? What's his
fucking name?

49:46.253 --> 49:49.882
I don't know. He likes to buy
titties for bitches in need.

49:49.957 --> 49:53.859
The call him, they call him,
uh, Large Bills.

49:53.927 --> 49:58.557
Large Bills. And he's had a hard-on
over that fucking girl for a long time.

49:58.632 --> 49:59.929
Where's he hanging out?

50:00.000 --> 50:02.230
I don't know.
He's all over.

50:02.302 --> 50:05.829
You can't miss him.
Rich white boy. Rolls with the brothers.

50:05.906 --> 50:08.807
Get out.

50:08.876 --> 50:11.037
Can I have
my gun back?

50:15.282 --> 50:16.806
Bitch.

50:52.686 --> 50:54.745
Open the door.
We're coming in.

50:54.822 --> 50:56.312
Sorry. Ladies
only tonight.

50:56.390 --> 50:57.721
I said open it.

50:57.791 --> 50:59.622
And I said no.

50:59.693 --> 51:02.253
You're not in the list.
You're not getting in.

51:08.969 --> 51:11.369
You're gonna
let us inside.

51:11.438 --> 51:15.602
Or I'm gonna split
your fucking head open.

51:45.873 --> 51:47.602
Boss.

51:50.544 --> 51:52.512
Wow.

51:52.579 --> 51:54.547
Come on.
It's all right.

52:00.754 --> 52:02.619
I have a problem.

52:02.689 --> 52:05.988
No shit why do I need the Lord
of the Ring motherfuckers in here.

52:06.059 --> 52:07.686
What's wrong with you?
Huh?

52:07.761 --> 52:11.993
You're sitting here with these
monkeys and you say that to me?

52:12.065 --> 52:14.932
Does it bother you to see
a man enjoying his life?

52:15.002 --> 52:18.733
Like something beyond, uh, like something
you might be able to comprehend?

52:18.805 --> 52:21.569
Huh? Huh?

52:23.310 --> 52:27.041
You know, I think you
finally found yourself.

52:28.315 --> 52:31.341
A white man who's
turned into a nigger.

52:33.987 --> 52:36.285
Wow!

52:36.356 --> 52:39.154
<i>It's okay. He called me</i>
<i>a nigger. I'm a nigger.</i>

52:41.995 --> 52:44.395
I'm a nigger,
motherfucker man.

52:44.464 --> 52:49.128
Look, you sell crystal meth
amphetamine to underage teenage girls

52:49.202 --> 52:52.729
and hook them into prostitution.
Wow, whoa, that's noble.

52:52.806 --> 52:57.834
That's what you are. That's what
you do. Get fucked. Okay? I'm busy.

52:57.911 --> 52:59.708
Two of our
brothers are dead.

52:59.780 --> 53:03.682
That's shit to me. What's it go
to do with me? I don't give a shit.

53:05.385 --> 53:08.445
The fucking crippled Greek.

53:09.923 --> 53:11.891
I want you to take care of it.

53:11.959 --> 53:15.122
They're off my side.

53:15.195 --> 53:18.028
Leave me out of it, okay?

53:18.098 --> 53:23.297
I severed my ties to you fucking
pieces of garbage a long time ago.

53:23.370 --> 53:26.339
See that?

53:26.406 --> 53:31.207
You could burn it off.
You could cut your fucking arm off.

53:31.278 --> 53:32.973
It's still gonna be there.

53:33.046 --> 53:35.105
Fuck you.

53:37.651 --> 53:40.381
You think the money
made me soft, don't ya?

53:40.454 --> 53:42.081
Engelhart.

53:42.155 --> 53:45.647
Don't make that mistake!
Okay?

53:47.027 --> 53:49.086
Are you gonna
help me or not?

53:50.797 --> 53:53.994
I'll have you erase from this
world just like this tattoo.

53:54.067 --> 53:55.796
No, I'm not
gonna help you.

53:55.869 --> 53:59.771
I will not help you and I cannot
help you. Get the fuck outta here.

54:07.314 --> 54:10.681
Those motherfuckers, too.
Get out of here.

54:16.423 --> 54:18.687
Hey. Hey, hey!

54:32.172 --> 54:33.730
<i>It's all right.</i>

54:33.807 --> 54:36.037
<i>It's all right.</i>
<i>Let 'em go.</i>

54:36.109 --> 54:39.909
Fucking goddamn barbarian.
Clean him up. Clean him up.

54:39.980 --> 54:42.915
Give me some dope.
Okay? Let's get high.

55:26.393 --> 55:27.951
Go on.

55:56.656 --> 55:58.715
<i>Yeah.</i>

56:04.231 --> 56:07.291
Come on.
Harder.

56:15.976 --> 56:17.841
Make him go away.

56:17.911 --> 56:19.742
Huh?

56:19.813 --> 56:21.576
<i>Make the driver leave.</i>

56:21.648 --> 56:23.479
Okay.

56:25.185 --> 56:27.119
<i>There.</i>

56:27.187 --> 56:29.052
He can't see shit.

56:29.122 --> 56:32.523
No, come on, I'm serious.
He's freaking me out.

56:32.592 --> 56:34.253
He looks like my father.

56:34.327 --> 56:37.694
Okay. I don't want... I don't
wanna meet your father right now.

56:38.899 --> 56:43.131
<i>Max. Take</i>
<i>a walk, you know.</i>

56:43.203 --> 56:44.602
Where do you want me to go?

56:44.671 --> 56:47.868
Some other place outside
the fucking car, okay?

56:49.442 --> 56:51.307
Got you, boss.

56:56.049 --> 56:57.744
He's gone.
Come here.

57:00.654 --> 57:02.918
I always had a thing for you.

57:04.324 --> 57:06.258
Okay, okay.
Sh. Stop. Stop.

57:06.326 --> 57:10.160
Look, I'm sorry about Virgil, baby.
I really am.

57:10.230 --> 57:12.960
We're all adults here, okay?

57:13.033 --> 57:14.762
Okay?

57:18.138 --> 57:19.469
Hey, what the fuck is that?

57:22.375 --> 57:25.037
Mother. Oh, mother.
You fuck.

57:25.111 --> 57:26.635
Ah!

57:28.882 --> 57:30.577
Motherfucker!

58:31.911 --> 58:33.572
Don't move.

58:36.316 --> 58:38.546
Get down.
Get down now!

58:42.422 --> 58:44.390
I know you.

58:45.325 --> 58:46.622
You're the cop.

58:46.693 --> 58:48.320
Listen, I wanna...

58:48.395 --> 58:51.796
<i>Shut up. I know</i>
<i>Virgil owns you.</i>

58:53.233 --> 58:55.428
It sucks, doesn't it?

58:55.502 --> 58:57.868
To be someone's property?

58:59.306 --> 59:00.739
Close your eyes.

59:29.636 --> 59:31.695
<i>Can I get my toast, please?</i>

59:31.771 --> 59:35.764
What? What, are you fucking
telling me that she ran away?

59:35.842 --> 59:40.506
This is fucking stupid.
Go on, take it.

59:40.580 --> 59:43.572
Beck, are you telling me you
had her and you let her get away?

59:43.650 --> 59:46.676
This is getting very
loud and very public.

59:46.753 --> 59:50.951
<i>That chick is nuts. I hope you got
good security in Virgil's place.</i>

59:51.024 --> 59:54.050
<i>She might be climbing through
his bedroom window right now.</i>

59:54.127 --> 59:57.961
You let me worry about Virgil.
Just get the job done.

59:59.666 --> 01:00:01.531
Fucking amateur.

01:00:01.601 --> 01:00:06.004
This guy is the wrong guy for the
fucking job. Why don't you eat something?

01:00:06.072 --> 01:00:09.007
What are you,
my fucking mother?

01:00:09.075 --> 01:00:13.034
Please. The last thing I would ever
wanna be is related to you, Lee.

01:00:20.620 --> 01:00:24.112
You left me standing at the
crime scene like a fucking idiot.

01:00:24.190 --> 01:00:26.385
Why were you even
tailing Large Bills?

01:00:26.459 --> 01:00:27.824
I was following
up a tip.

01:00:27.894 --> 01:00:29.555
Bullshit!

01:00:29.629 --> 01:00:32.860
Yesterday you happened to be at
the scene of a public massacre,

01:00:32.932 --> 01:00:36.993
and today a murdered celebrity.
What the fuck is going on here?

01:00:37.070 --> 01:00:39.698
Why am I not in the loop?

01:00:39.773 --> 01:00:42.003
Can we do this tomorrow?
My head's fucked up.

01:00:42.075 --> 01:00:45.442
No, you're gonna stay here and you're
gonna tell me what the fuck's going on.

01:00:45.512 --> 01:00:49.175
You're a liar. You were lying
to me. You're a fucking liar.

01:00:49.249 --> 01:00:51.809
<i>Why are doing this to me?
I'm supposed to be your...</i>

01:00:51.885 --> 01:00:54.854
What, huh?
What is it? What do you want?

01:00:54.921 --> 01:00:57.685
I want you to tell me
the fucking truth.

01:01:22.382 --> 01:01:24.179
What's that look?

01:01:25.618 --> 01:01:26.983
Nothing.

01:01:27.053 --> 01:01:29.180
That was definitely
a look.

01:01:29.255 --> 01:01:33.783
I forgot how you always make me
feel like you're doing me a favor.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:36.090
What, are you
gonna cry now?

01:01:37.864 --> 01:01:40.856
Kevin asked
about you again.

01:01:40.934 --> 01:01:42.663
You and Vadalos.

01:01:42.735 --> 01:01:44.669
<i>Says he hears things.</i>

01:01:46.406 --> 01:01:48.135
I know something
is up with you.

01:01:48.208 --> 01:01:50.335
I can see it in your face.

01:01:52.245 --> 01:01:54.611
I'm gonna go back
down to the limousine.

01:01:54.681 --> 01:01:56.876
You go down
to the coroner's office.

01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:59.885
They got another one there.
Looks like the same M.O.

01:02:02.388 --> 01:02:03.650
So.

01:02:06.493 --> 01:02:10.486
You gonna tell me what's going
on and let me help you or not?

01:02:18.371 --> 01:02:20.362
Fine.

01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:24.171
Leave your keys and lock
the door on the way out.

01:02:35.755 --> 01:02:39.851
Look, I'm gonna fix it.

01:02:39.926 --> 01:02:42.121
I swear to God
I'm gonna fix it.

01:02:42.195 --> 01:02:43.560
Yeah.

01:03:02.248 --> 01:03:05.046
What did I say?
My whole world's in that car.

01:03:05.118 --> 01:03:06.813
Of course not.

01:03:08.922 --> 01:03:10.947
It's all falling apart.

01:03:11.024 --> 01:03:13.083
What did I do wrong, Gus?

01:03:13.159 --> 01:03:14.888
How could I stop this?

01:03:14.961 --> 01:03:17.122
The minute you walked
out of that hospital,

01:03:17.196 --> 01:03:19.562
you should've killed everyone.

01:03:19.632 --> 01:03:21.463
Everyone.

01:03:27.006 --> 01:03:29.065
Hey, Gus.

01:03:45.024 --> 01:03:48.983
The same Neo-Nazi design
as the other dead arian.

01:03:49.062 --> 01:03:52.327
Anyone else been down here to see him?
Any cops?

01:03:52.398 --> 01:03:53.956
No, not yet.

01:03:54.033 --> 01:03:56.092
Can I borrow your computer?

01:04:40.046 --> 01:04:41.673
Get out of here!

01:04:41.748 --> 01:04:45.684
Everybody out! Now!

01:04:45.752 --> 01:04:48.482
<i>What's wrong with you?
We're fucking having a party.</i>

01:04:48.554 --> 01:04:50.522
Get the fuck out!

01:04:50.590 --> 01:04:52.751
<i>Get these fucking</i>
<i>whores outta here!</i>

01:04:54.694 --> 01:04:56.559
Fucking chill.

01:05:29.162 --> 01:05:32.427
Do you know what
I'm gonna do to you?

01:06:00.860 --> 01:06:02.691
No!

01:06:20.213 --> 01:06:21.510
You're hit.

01:06:21.581 --> 01:06:23.276
Yes.

01:06:35.962 --> 01:06:37.759
Beck, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:06:37.830 --> 01:06:39.058
Stay out of this.

01:06:39.132 --> 01:06:41.191
You're cleaning up
for her and Vadalos.

01:06:41.267 --> 01:06:42.757
I fucking covered for you!

01:06:42.835 --> 01:06:45.326
You have no idea what's
going on here. Just let it go.

01:06:45.404 --> 01:06:48.271
Fuck you.
I'm calling this one in.

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:10.154
We have to go.
Come on, policeman.

01:07:10.229 --> 01:07:13.164
<i>We have to leave.</i>
<i>You can't wait here any longer.</i>

01:07:34.420 --> 01:07:36.479
You're taking me
to him, huh?

01:07:38.024 --> 01:07:40.356
Do you know that
I have the money?

01:07:42.728 --> 01:07:45.026
He didn't tell you
about the money, did he?

01:07:45.097 --> 01:07:46.894
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:07:46.966 --> 01:07:50.561
I'm talking about
over $2 million.

01:07:57.844 --> 01:08:00.039
It looks better in
real life, doesn't it?

01:08:00.112 --> 01:08:01.670
This is Virgil's money?

01:08:01.747 --> 01:08:04.773
No. It's mine now.

01:08:04.851 --> 01:08:07.319
And it's ours
if you let me go.

01:08:08.821 --> 01:08:10.550
Here.

01:08:11.524 --> 01:08:13.355
Uncuff me.

01:08:15.194 --> 01:08:17.287
It's just for now.
I have to clean myself.

01:08:17.363 --> 01:08:20.924
You don't want to take me to
Virgil with a wounded leg, do you?

01:08:47.792 --> 01:08:49.283
Stop it. What
are you doing?

01:08:49.362 --> 01:08:51.830
You delicate
all of a sudden?

01:08:53.633 --> 01:08:56.466
It went through. Missed
the bone. You're all right.

01:09:00.473 --> 01:09:04.000
<i>Do you know what will happen to
me If you take me back to him?</i>

01:09:05.877 --> 01:09:08.108
He's not an
angel, you know.

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:09.578
I know.

01:09:10.683 --> 01:09:13.379
Your English is pretty good.

01:09:13.452 --> 01:09:16.478
Yeah. Well, that's
because Virgil hired

01:09:16.555 --> 01:09:19.921
a dialect coach for me.

01:09:19.992 --> 01:09:22.756
He wanted me to
sound more American.

01:09:22.828 --> 01:09:25.126
Dialect coach.

01:09:25.197 --> 01:09:27.256
And you put a knife in his gut.

01:09:27.332 --> 01:09:28.857
You know what?

01:09:28.935 --> 01:09:31.665
Don't be so quick
to judge, Mr. Policeman.

01:09:31.737 --> 01:09:33.602
You don't know
anything about me.

01:09:33.673 --> 01:09:34.765
I know enough.

01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:36.774
Oh, do you? Huh?

01:09:38.611 --> 01:09:39.839
Do you?

01:09:39.912 --> 01:09:42.608
Control yourself.
It's not spring break.

01:09:44.383 --> 01:09:47.819
Huh? We could go away.

01:09:47.886 --> 01:09:49.718
And we could just disappear.

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:54.120
What is the matter?

01:09:55.995 --> 01:09:59.829
You're just going to take me back
to him and it's going to be all over.

01:09:59.899 --> 01:10:02.493
Come on.
We can disappear.

01:10:30.496 --> 01:10:32.555
What does he have on you?

01:10:39.839 --> 01:10:42.501
<i>I'm ruined.</i>

01:10:42.575 --> 01:10:45.271
Excuse me a second.

01:10:52.651 --> 01:10:54.243
Hello.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:55.719
Yeah. I got her.

01:10:55.788 --> 01:10:59.189
Good. Bring her to my
nightclub right now.

01:10:59.258 --> 01:11:02.625
Fuck you. I'll drive her right
down to the Police Station.

01:11:02.695 --> 01:11:05.129
What the hell is wrong with you?
What do you want?

01:11:05.197 --> 01:11:07.597
Be in the parking lot
at the Safari Inn.

01:11:07.666 --> 01:11:10.760
Anything's out of whack,
I'll start shooting.

01:11:10.836 --> 01:11:13.999
Fuck this one or you're
gonna end up on a garbage can.

01:11:14.073 --> 01:11:16.007
Do you hear me, cop?

01:11:18.677 --> 01:11:20.110
Was that him?

01:11:20.179 --> 01:11:22.943
No. Look, I gotta go.
I gotta check something out.

01:11:23.015 --> 01:11:24.915
Where the fuck
are you going?

01:11:24.984 --> 01:11:26.451
To my nightclub.
I got a problem.

01:11:26.519 --> 01:11:28.453
I'll go with you.

01:11:28.521 --> 01:11:30.785
<i>No. You stay here with Virgil.
You need anything?</i>

01:11:30.856 --> 01:11:32.118
No.

01:11:53.412 --> 01:11:56.040
I'm gonna kill all
these motherfuckers.

01:12:06.025 --> 01:12:09.825
What the hell is your problem, cop?
Where is the fucking bitch?

01:12:23.843 --> 01:12:26.710
Every dog
has his day.

01:12:26.779 --> 01:12:28.679
Did you find her?

01:12:28.747 --> 01:12:30.214
Mm-hm.

01:12:36.355 --> 01:12:37.413
<i>Fuck.</i>

01:12:37.490 --> 01:12:38.684
Shit, they're not here.

01:12:38.757 --> 01:12:39.883
Come on.

01:12:55.741 --> 01:12:59.734
You know, you should've
asked me about Alex.

01:13:01.614 --> 01:13:05.277
<i>I could've warned you about him.
He was always the worst one.</i>

01:13:05.351 --> 01:13:08.252
<i>Alex was in on this with
you from the beginning?</i>

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:11.187
<i>And you took off without</i>
<i>giving him his cut?</i>

01:13:12.491 --> 01:13:14.083
Yes.

01:13:14.160 --> 01:13:15.491
<i>He's a Judas.</i>

01:13:15.561 --> 01:13:17.256
<i>And what's</i>
<i>that make you?</i>

01:13:17.329 --> 01:13:19.991
I'm a lot of things,
but I'm not a traitor.

01:13:22.234 --> 01:13:24.361
I'm sure Virgil
doesn't feel that way.

01:13:24.436 --> 01:13:27.064
I stuck by Virgil
no matter what.

01:13:27.139 --> 01:13:28.731
Then why did you do it?

01:13:30.776 --> 01:13:32.744
Two years ago

01:13:35.714 --> 01:13:37.511
my little sister disappeared.

01:13:37.583 --> 01:13:40.882
<i>She was on her way</i>
<i>here from Russia.</i>

01:13:40.953 --> 01:13:44.150
<i>Virgil set up the work,
visa, social security number,</i>

01:13:44.223 --> 01:13:46.157
<i>and a job when</i>
<i>she got here.</i>

01:13:46.225 --> 01:13:49.592
<i>And the night that she was supposed
to arrive, I was at home waiting</i>

01:13:49.662 --> 01:13:54.429
<i>for this phone call. Virgil's guys were
going to the airport to pick her up.</i>

01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:58.698
<i>They were gonna take her to a safe
house until they were sure it was clear.</i>

01:13:58.771 --> 01:14:00.705
<i>And that night came,</i>

01:14:00.773 --> 01:14:05.403
and it passed.
And there was no phone call.

01:14:07.213 --> 01:14:11.240
<i>Virgil's guy at the airport
said that she never arrived.</i>

01:14:12.985 --> 01:14:16.113
And my aunt back home said that
she definitely got on the plane.

01:14:16.188 --> 01:14:21.421
<i>And Virgil swore that he didn't
know what happened to her.</i>

01:14:24.496 --> 01:14:26.987
And I believed him.

01:14:31.036 --> 01:14:35.700
And then a year later I got
this phone call from this girl

01:14:36.976 --> 01:14:40.241
who was at the
safe house that night.

01:14:43.282 --> 01:14:45.341
<i>She was a drug addict.</i>

01:14:45.417 --> 01:14:49.183
<i>And the Nazis made these
girls work their habit off.</i>

01:14:49.255 --> 01:14:51.951
<i>She told me that</i>
<i>she saw everything.</i>

01:14:52.024 --> 01:14:54.458
<i>That Ernesto</i>
<i>and the skinheads</i>

01:14:54.526 --> 01:14:58.121
<i>were celebrating some kind of
deal that they made with Virgil.</i>

01:14:58.197 --> 01:15:02.531
<i>And those rich idiots were there
who think that they are so hard.</i>

01:15:02.601 --> 01:15:05.126
<i>And they got so tweaked
out of their minds.</i>

01:15:05.204 --> 01:15:10.301
<i>One of them decided that Staysa
was just another Russian whore.</i>

01:15:10.376 --> 01:15:11.809
Let's fuck her.

01:15:14.847 --> 01:15:16.940
<i>And there were</i>
<i>five of them.</i>

01:15:18.917 --> 01:15:20.544
And they took turns.

01:15:25.724 --> 01:15:27.817
Stop it!

01:15:52.718 --> 01:15:55.448
And then they left
her there like a dog.

01:15:57.690 --> 01:15:59.453
And what did
Virgil do?

01:15:59.525 --> 01:16:01.755
<i>He lied about it.</i>

01:16:06.532 --> 01:16:10.935
<i>He said that that girl
was a drug addict.</i>

01:16:12.004 --> 01:16:15.132
She didn't know
any names.

01:16:15.207 --> 01:16:17.334
So she was crazy.

01:16:18.877 --> 01:16:23.644
But I know Virgil.
Nobody lies better than him.

01:16:27.319 --> 01:16:29.344
So, I went to Alex.

01:16:29.421 --> 01:16:33.721
Leave it to me.
We have to take it from the start.

01:16:33.792 --> 01:16:35.851
<i>And he told me</i>
<i>that Virgil</i>

01:16:35.928 --> 01:16:39.694
was furious
about what happened.

01:16:39.765 --> 01:16:41.289
Where is she?

01:16:48.207 --> 01:16:50.004
My God.

01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:56.270
Who did this?

01:17:15.534 --> 01:17:17.468
Clean it up, goddamn it.

01:17:17.536 --> 01:17:22.098
<i>But he couldn't start a war over
one Illegal Russian immigrant girl.</i>

01:17:22.174 --> 01:17:24.608
<i>Let alone tell me</i>
<i>the truth.</i>

01:17:26.912 --> 01:17:30.006
Hey, shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck!

01:17:30.082 --> 01:17:31.811
<i>So he did nothing.</i>

01:17:34.052 --> 01:17:36.612
I'm sorry.

01:17:36.688 --> 01:17:39.213
But listen,
I'll help you.

01:17:39.291 --> 01:17:40.781
<i>Alex wanted</i>
<i>to move up.</i>

01:17:40.859 --> 01:17:42.121
I'll help you.

01:17:42.194 --> 01:17:44.594
<i>I wanted to get even.</i>

01:17:44.663 --> 01:17:49.293
<i>He gave me names,</i>
<i>and I planned.</i>

01:17:49.368 --> 01:17:51.199
<i>And I waited.</i>

01:17:56.875 --> 01:17:59.844
All right.
One million bucks.

01:17:59.912 --> 01:18:02.540
Leave tonight
and never come back.

01:18:02.614 --> 01:18:04.047
Understand?

01:18:04.116 --> 01:18:05.606
Yeah.

01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:09.585
Are you going to kill him?

01:18:09.655 --> 01:18:12.385
I'll handle Virgil.
You just disappear.

01:18:13.392 --> 01:18:14.552
No.

01:18:14.626 --> 01:18:18.084
I want to know
that he suffered.

01:18:18.163 --> 01:18:21.394
He's gonna find out he lost
his cousin, his money, and you.

01:18:21.467 --> 01:18:25.870
Believe me, he won't
feel like he got off easy.

01:18:25.938 --> 01:18:29.738
I'd tell you to be careful, but I
think you know how to handle yourself.

01:18:35.547 --> 01:18:36.946
Let's go.

01:18:51.163 --> 01:18:52.858
What's your name?

01:19:17.890 --> 01:19:19.551
You better get...

01:19:19.625 --> 01:19:21.388
Shut up a second.

01:19:29.468 --> 01:19:31.026
Now we're talking.

01:19:40.178 --> 01:19:43.272
Special Agent Donovan.

01:19:43.348 --> 01:19:47.011
Yeah, it's Beck. I need you
to check the archives for me.

01:19:47.085 --> 01:19:48.814
Virgil Vadalos.

01:19:48.887 --> 01:19:52.448
I think the Bureau had him under
surveillance about two years back.

01:19:52.524 --> 01:19:55.982
I need everything you got.
Log sheets, locations, ASAP.

01:22:28.146 --> 01:22:29.408
Bitch.

01:22:36.621 --> 01:22:39.181
Oh, Virgil.

01:22:39.257 --> 01:22:42.090
What were you thinking?

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:44.856
All of this for
a piece of ass.

01:22:46.465 --> 01:22:48.296
<i>What did you do</i>
<i>to him, huh?</i>

01:22:48.366 --> 01:22:50.926
<i>He doesn't even</i>
<i>trust me anymore.</i>

01:22:52.738 --> 01:22:55.866
Well, all of that
is about to change!

01:23:03.682 --> 01:23:04.910
Yeah.

01:23:06.384 --> 01:23:09.649
You know, in a way
I understand you.

01:23:09.721 --> 01:23:11.814
I never had
shit neither.

01:23:11.890 --> 01:23:14.188
And no matter
how much I got,

01:23:14.259 --> 01:23:17.285
I never fit in with
those cocksuckers.

01:23:20.899 --> 01:23:22.662
I hate him.

01:23:22.734 --> 01:23:27.034
I hate their kids.
The fucking little dogs.

01:23:31.343 --> 01:23:33.243
But that's okay.

01:23:35.213 --> 01:23:36.703
Hate's a good thing.

01:23:45.157 --> 01:23:47.387
Hate keeps me warm at night.

01:23:50.061 --> 01:23:54.157
Now, I'm gonna take this crowbar
and I'm gonna bash your head in.

01:23:54.232 --> 01:23:56.427
Then I'm gonna roll
you down that hill,

01:23:56.501 --> 01:23:59.902
and let the animals get at you
while you're still nice and warm.

01:23:59.971 --> 01:24:02.064
And everything will be
like it was before.

01:24:02.140 --> 01:24:06.372
Virgil and Alex
used to laugh about you.

01:24:06.444 --> 01:24:07.843
What?

01:24:07.913 --> 01:24:11.371
Alex was Virgil's favorite.

01:24:17.289 --> 01:24:19.086
Gimme that, you bitch!

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:32.099
<i>Lee, I found the perfect</i>
<i>place to bury her.</i>

01:26:01.893 --> 01:26:03.485
What's that?

01:26:03.561 --> 01:26:05.995
Your money.
Most of it.

01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:11.264
That, that's nothing.

01:26:12.971 --> 01:26:15.872
Men bring me bags
of money every day.

01:26:18.476 --> 01:26:20.535
Where is she?

01:26:29.454 --> 01:26:33.823
Have I ever gone out of
my way to cause you grief?

01:26:33.892 --> 01:26:36.292
Using my brother
to keep me on a leash.

01:26:36.361 --> 01:26:38.591
Do you think that makes
you a good Samaritan?

01:26:41.766 --> 01:26:44.428
You're so concerned about
the safety of your brother

01:26:44.502 --> 01:26:47.027
you come here and you
turn on me like this?

01:26:47.105 --> 01:26:50.370
<i>Turn on you?
I got a fucking cop killed tonight!<i></i></i>

01:26:50.442 --> 01:26:52.774
Don't insult me.

01:26:52.844 --> 01:26:54.072
You could care less.

01:26:54.145 --> 01:26:56.204
Virgil, don't be crazy.

01:26:56.281 --> 01:26:57.714
You fucked her!

01:26:57.782 --> 01:27:00.182
Jesus Christ. You don't
even know what's going on.

01:27:08.059 --> 01:27:11.859
<i>I told her to disappear. Enough
dead bodies, Virgil. End it.</i>

01:27:14.899 --> 01:27:18.335
The alarm's down. The electric's
cut. Somebody's on the property.

01:27:18.403 --> 01:27:20.064
You piece of shit!

01:27:30.281 --> 01:27:32.943
<i>Hey, boss, we gotta</i>
<i>get outta here.</i>

01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:57.999
Just go ahead.

01:27:59.911 --> 01:28:01.742
You already killed me.

01:28:01.813 --> 01:28:04.805
<i>I died that night</i>
<i>before you put the...</i>

01:28:04.883 --> 01:28:06.407
Be quiet.

01:28:07.919 --> 01:28:10.149
I would've given you
the world if you asked me.

01:28:10.221 --> 01:28:12.052
Can you give me
back my sister?

01:28:14.092 --> 01:28:15.491
Can you do that?

01:28:16.928 --> 01:28:18.759
I told you.

01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:21.765
I don't know what
happened to her.

01:28:24.502 --> 01:28:26.629
<i>Jesus!</i>

01:28:28.206 --> 01:28:30.902
Raina, listen to me.

01:28:30.975 --> 01:28:33.239
<i>No one knows</i>
<i>where she is.</i>

01:28:33.311 --> 01:28:37.907
She was lying there for
eight hours in the trash.

01:28:37.982 --> 01:28:40.644
The fucking garbage
man found her.

01:28:40.718 --> 01:28:43.653
I've no idea what
you're talking about.

01:28:43.721 --> 01:28:47.157
All those months searching for her.
She was in a mental institution.

01:28:47.225 --> 01:28:48.988
She didn't even
know her name.

01:28:52.564 --> 01:28:54.361
Ah!

01:28:58.103 --> 01:29:01.971
I already know everything.
Your cousin told me.

01:29:03.174 --> 01:29:05.165
Alex?

01:29:06.244 --> 01:29:08.405
Alex set you both up.

01:29:14.486 --> 01:29:16.647
The Feds had Virgil
under surveillance.

01:29:16.721 --> 01:29:20.487
<i>There's no way he was at
the safe house. It was Alex.</i>

01:29:23.495 --> 01:29:25.360
<i>Why, motherfucker?</i>

01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:29.890
<i>He was supposed to go to the safe
house to pick up your sister.</i>

01:29:29.968 --> 01:29:32.698
He was working
with those animals.

01:29:32.770 --> 01:29:34.704
Where the fuck is she?

01:29:38.176 --> 01:29:40.303
<i>What did you fucking do?</i>

01:29:40.378 --> 01:29:44.212
I'll kill you!
I'll kill all of you, motherfuckers!

01:29:44.282 --> 01:29:47.376
<i>Which one of you</i>
<i>motherfuckers did this?</i>

01:29:49.454 --> 01:29:51.786
Clean this up.

01:29:51.856 --> 01:29:53.255
Clean it up now!

01:29:53.324 --> 01:29:55.724
She never got on
the fucking plane.

01:29:55.793 --> 01:29:58.762
And there's nothing we can do.
There's nothing you can do.

01:29:58.830 --> 01:30:00.923
You think he fucking
loves you but he don't.

01:30:00.999 --> 01:30:04.435
<i>All he fucking cares</i>
<i>about is his money.</i>

01:30:04.502 --> 01:30:07.903
Go on, take it.
Together we can have it all.

01:30:09.741 --> 01:30:11.368
Make sure you
kill them all.

01:30:19.450 --> 01:30:23.750
<i>That fuckin' greedy bastard.</i>
<i>He played us all!</i>

01:30:23.821 --> 01:30:27.018
He's telling the truth.

01:30:27.091 --> 01:30:30.583
But be my guest.
Pull his fucking head off.

01:30:30.662 --> 01:30:33.130
<i>Why don't you?</i>

01:30:33.198 --> 01:30:36.133
You know what the worst
part of all this is?

01:30:36.201 --> 01:30:41.104
<i>Is seeing you hurt,</i>
<i>and knowing you think I caused it.</i>

01:30:47.979 --> 01:30:52.973
<i>Would you say, he's trying to
blackmail me and pin it all on him.</i>

01:30:53.051 --> 01:30:56.077
<i>Bullshit I They'll</i>
<i>never let you go.</i>

01:30:56.154 --> 01:31:00.215
<i>He is a dirty cop and his
own people will fry him.</i>

01:31:01.326 --> 01:31:03.260
Just shoot him.

01:31:03.328 --> 01:31:05.819
<i>It'll just be you and me.</i>

01:31:08.166 --> 01:31:10.191
Just you and me.

01:31:12.670 --> 01:31:14.900
It always was anyway.

01:31:14.973 --> 01:31:17.271
<i>Wasn't it?</i>

01:32:55.273 --> 01:32:56.570
<i>It's over.</i>

01:32:56.641 --> 01:32:59.474
Or maybe one of us
will make it to that gun

01:32:59.544 --> 01:33:02.342
before the SWAT
team gets in here.

01:33:06.617 --> 01:33:08.107
Yeah.

01:33:10.088 --> 01:33:11.817
Maybe.

01:35:52.683 --> 01:35:56.050
