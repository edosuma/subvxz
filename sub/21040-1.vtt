01:47.097 --> 01:48.777

01:48.833 --> 01:51.393

01:54.220 --> 01:56.954
- Sweep! Yes!
- Yes!

01:56.980 --> 01:58.026
Yes!

02:01.095 --> 02:02.095
Yes!

02:02.143 --> 02:04.781
- Can we get a drink now?
- Yes!

02:21.924 --> 02:23.724
- That is rank!
- What did you expect?

02:23.750 --> 02:25.820
- Chanel No. 5?
- Evie, keep it down!

02:25.860 --> 02:27.220
Aye, keep it down, Kieran.

02:27.540 --> 02:29.300
Place could be crawling with Feds.

02:31.468 --> 02:33.660
♪ What's that comin' over the hill? ♪

02:33.700 --> 02:36.780
♪ Is it a monster? Is it a monster? ♪

02:36.947 --> 02:39.500
♪ What's that comin' over the hill? ♪

02:39.540 --> 02:42.620
♪ Is it a monster? Is it a monster? ♪

02:44.140 --> 02:46.180
- Did you win?
- Handed their arses to them.

02:46.220 --> 02:47.934
Way to go!

02:48.620 --> 02:50.420
- You managed to escape?
- For once.

02:50.642 --> 02:53.460
- Hey, I'm always up for a night out.
- Yeah. "Always" as in "never".

02:55.300 --> 02:57.460
I'll tell you why I'm
doing better than you.

02:57.765 --> 03:00.020
- You've got a bigger boat.
- No. Sonar.

03:00.220 --> 03:03.300
The first thing the tourists ask:
"Does your boat have sonar?"

03:03.407 --> 03:04.807
So why are you selling it, then?

03:04.917 --> 03:06.732
Underwater drone.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.546
I ordered it this morning.

03:10.940 --> 03:14.433
Of course, Annie thinks we need
a new car. Which we do.

03:14.618 --> 03:16.940
So you want me to buy your sonar?

03:16.980 --> 03:19.208
You're working Loch Ness.
It'll pay for itself.

03:19.684 --> 03:22.460
If there was something down there
I might think about it, but...

03:22.722 --> 03:25.220
Leighton, maybe you just
don't want to see it.

03:25.260 --> 03:26.796
So what do you reckon?

03:27.839 --> 03:29.479
Leighton? He doesn't fancy me.

03:29.639 --> 03:33.218
I just heard him saying "I'm getting
a semi-on for Mhari."

03:33.834 --> 03:35.701
Semillon. It's a white wine.

03:36.058 --> 03:39.024
- Oh, you're so funny!
- Might be nice for Dessie.

03:39.050 --> 03:40.597
Man about the house.

03:41.599 --> 03:43.500
Be nice to have someone
around the house to talk to.

03:43.540 --> 03:44.999
I can hardly get a word out of my son.

03:45.523 --> 03:47.007
Do you think he might be...

03:47.340 --> 03:48.445
Say it.

03:48.680 --> 03:49.893
Straight.

03:50.471 --> 03:52.471
You're a cheeky bitch!

03:52.787 --> 03:55.340
- What about Evie?
- What? What about her?

03:55.380 --> 03:57.653
Well, going all the way to Australia
to get away from you.

03:57.980 --> 03:59.580
That's not definite.

04:04.655 --> 04:05.995
Jonjo...

04:22.689 --> 04:24.065
How's it looking?

04:25.695 --> 04:27.415
Er, tail needs to be longer.

04:27.580 --> 04:30.460
Evie, look. I've got
a seal's willy bone!

04:30.500 --> 04:32.420
- Jonjo...
- Is it a boy monster or a girl?

04:32.460 --> 04:33.484
Ssh.

04:36.460 --> 04:37.829
I heard something.

04:38.165 --> 04:39.820
Oh, is it the Feds?

04:49.620 --> 04:51.500
Why did you let me drink so much?

04:51.540 --> 04:53.233
You're off tomorrow. Relax.

04:55.380 --> 04:58.034
- Do you think Leighton fancies you?
- Leighton?

04:58.686 --> 05:00.682
Do you not see the way he looks at you?

05:02.064 --> 05:04.145
How could he not fancy you?

05:08.900 --> 05:11.460
What do you think the
monster's doing now?

05:11.680 --> 05:13.138
Well, it's nocturnal.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.358
Probably getting ready to hunt.

05:19.218 --> 05:20.479
Idiot!

05:36.603 --> 05:38.516
_

05:59.697 --> 06:00.897
Can I grab that?

06:01.180 --> 06:03.100
'Morning, Mum. Beautiful day.'

06:03.140 --> 06:05.620
- Morning, Mum. Can I grab that?
- Surprised you're up.

06:05.941 --> 06:08.926
I'm surprised you are.
Rolling in half past drunk.

06:10.613 --> 06:12.212
- What is it?
- Nothing.

06:12.728 --> 06:14.374
- Come on...
- Mum.

06:15.551 --> 06:17.079
Is it a boy?

06:17.462 --> 06:18.909
Yeah, Mum, it's a boy.

06:18.980 --> 06:20.235
Evie.

06:22.689 --> 06:24.028
Have a good day.

06:56.488 --> 06:58.568
You're doing great, sweetheart.
Keep going.

07:07.420 --> 07:09.721
I think you might be making her nervous.

07:10.732 --> 07:12.605
Am I making you nervous, Isla?

07:13.668 --> 07:15.100
No.

07:33.121 --> 07:37.558
"We peer out at the world
through holes in a mask"?

07:38.500 --> 07:41.540
Do we, Dessie? Are these
your deeper-most thoughts?

07:41.580 --> 07:43.580
- Give me it.
- Give it back to him.

07:49.020 --> 07:53.020
- Big man. Baws finally drop?
- Prick.

07:55.568 --> 08:00.048
"The Shadow demands the
thrill of fangs and claws,

08:00.860 --> 08:06.725
the dog within going wild after
a lifetime on the leash."

08:08.319 --> 08:09.487
Anyone?

08:12.221 --> 08:13.690
Carl Jung.

08:14.904 --> 08:16.180
Ah, the only student who knows

08:16.220 --> 08:18.441
is the one who's leaving
halfway through her course.

08:19.567 --> 08:22.178
So, what do we know about Carl Jung?

08:23.446 --> 08:24.772
Mr Baxter?

08:25.441 --> 08:26.910
- Me?
- Yeah.

08:27.527 --> 08:29.220
Absolutely SFA.

08:32.100 --> 08:35.506
OK. So, let's embark on a
voyage of discovery, shall we?

08:39.121 --> 08:40.414
I'm sorry?

08:41.860 --> 08:43.940
There's not going to be
any more music lessons.

08:43.980 --> 08:47.837
- What? Is this because...
- I'm...

08:48.437 --> 08:50.180
I don't need to explain myself.

08:51.062 --> 08:53.860
Your wife promised Isla I'd be kept on.

08:54.336 --> 08:56.606
This is a Christian household.

08:57.144 --> 08:59.321
- I don't understand. I...
- Have you listened to that?

08:59.928 --> 09:02.568
- Some of it.
- So, Isla's nine.

09:02.945 --> 09:04.620
We were talking about harmony.

09:04.660 --> 09:05.773
It's filth.

09:07.009 --> 09:08.747
And you're a hypocrite.

09:10.253 --> 09:12.653
I taught Bethan McGrellish.

09:16.327 --> 09:19.739
Don't worry, I won't
betray a confidence.

09:24.154 --> 09:26.154
Hey. Hey!

09:27.060 --> 09:31.760
You call me a hypocrite and you walk
away? Do you think that's the end of it?

09:37.340 --> 09:40.060
- It's Frank.
- It's my day off.

09:41.900 --> 09:43.380
Frank. Good morning.

09:43.420 --> 09:44.574
Is it?

09:45.020 --> 09:48.300
Put on STV news. Tell me
what kind of a morning it is.

09:48.534 --> 09:49.854
<i>Residents of Lochnafoy and...</i>

09:51.220 --> 09:53.100
<i>..woke to the sad news that</i>

09:53.140 --> 09:55.020
<i>the Loch Ness Monster is dead.</i>

09:55.060 --> 09:56.460
That's you fekked!

09:56.500 --> 09:57.740
<i>The bones of Nessie were found</i>

09:57.780 --> 09:59.540
<i>washed up this morning</i>

09:59.580 --> 10:02.020
<i>on the bonny bonny banks of the loch.</i>

10:03.060 --> 10:05.942
Frank? I'm watching the report.
I'm not sure what you want me to do.

10:06.340 --> 10:09.460
It's a bloody health hazard.
Get it incinerated.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.900
But, Frank,
what about the scientific value?

10:11.940 --> 10:13.087
Aye, aye...

10:15.380 --> 10:16.520
He hung up.

10:21.820 --> 10:23.540
..Officer Jason Denny.

10:23.580 --> 10:27.100
So, Officer Denny, exactly what do
you think this is behind you then?

10:27.140 --> 10:31.500
Er, well, I'm no expert but er, I suppose
it could be some kind of marine life.

10:31.540 --> 10:33.500
A type of plesiosaur perhaps.

10:33.540 --> 10:35.540
Er, yeah, possibly.

10:35.580 --> 10:37.954
I mean, you can see what
kind of looks like flippers.

10:38.373 --> 10:41.609
I can see a bit of pig and
cow and a seal's boabie.

10:42.140 --> 10:43.327
Off, please.

10:43.353 --> 10:45.820
Stop making an arse of yourself.
Start filling these.

10:46.057 --> 10:48.700
Er, hi. Excuse me, would you
mind if I had a quick word...

10:48.740 --> 10:50.576
Thanks, Kirsty Wark,
I'll take it from here.

10:50.699 --> 10:52.352
Any of youse want to help?

10:52.839 --> 10:54.839
Didn't think so. Off you go!

10:55.357 --> 10:57.016
No more selfies.

10:58.309 --> 11:00.318
You think this is a crime scene?

11:05.048 --> 11:06.414
You still here?

11:12.385 --> 11:14.905
You've taken your pictures,
now please leave.

11:17.460 --> 11:20.585
Thank you! See you later.
Everybody, off you go!

11:20.820 --> 11:22.248
Yes, go!

11:22.274 --> 11:24.620
Walk faster, please. Thank you.

11:25.331 --> 11:28.540
That's it, one foot in front
of the other. Well done.

11:34.336 --> 11:36.896
The first recorded sighting
of the monster

11:37.135 --> 11:40.717
was by St Columba in AD 565.

11:41.287 --> 11:44.527
My first sighting was at the age of 10.

11:45.540 --> 11:48.220
I was swimming about
half a mile off Foyers Point

11:48.260 --> 11:51.900
when I started getting pulled beneath
the waves by a strong undertow.

11:52.198 --> 11:55.531
I looked down, and saw
this huge black shape

11:55.557 --> 11:58.420
about 20 foot long, moving beneath me.

12:00.060 --> 12:02.460
Coming up on the starboard
side is a rival tour.

12:03.028 --> 12:07.140
The owner is a non-believer, so
you're invited to jeer the infidel.

12:07.180 --> 12:09.780
Go on, give it some.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.820
You need to see this!

12:21.940 --> 12:24.171
- <i>How's it looking?</i>
- One of my customers showed it me.

12:25.540 --> 12:27.620
<i>Evie, look...</i>

12:27.660 --> 12:29.260
<i>I've got a seal's willy bone!</i>

12:29.300 --> 12:30.666
I thought you'd want to know.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.495
We should be wearing masks.

13:18.104 --> 13:19.391
For disguise?

13:20.797 --> 13:22.280
For the smell.

13:22.621 --> 13:25.277
Aye, right. Of course.

13:31.584 --> 13:33.628
- Annie?
- Oh, morning, Ken.

13:33.654 --> 13:36.063
- We think these might be yours.
- Eh, eh...

13:36.380 --> 13:37.860
Yeah, I saw the news.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.997
That would violate
about 700 regulations.

13:41.023 --> 13:42.540
Is Jonjo at college?

13:42.904 --> 13:44.329
You think my son would do this?

13:44.355 --> 13:46.660
This is not a criminal investigation.

13:46.847 --> 13:50.323
Jonjo's had his moments but
he's got his head down now.

13:51.740 --> 13:54.300
I really don't fancy putting
this back in the van.

13:54.340 --> 13:56.700
- Yeah, I nearly heaved like three times.
- Yeah.

13:56.887 --> 13:58.216
Would you mind?

13:59.976 --> 14:01.250
Follow me.

14:23.380 --> 14:24.900
Have you got a phone?

14:25.461 --> 14:27.441
There's a man fallen here.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.920
Annie, it's someone you know.

14:54.880 --> 14:57.200
Oh, God. Niall...

14:57.814 --> 14:59.105
Why do they do it?

14:59.720 --> 15:02.186
There was a guy last week
on Ben Nevis in flip-flops.

15:02.489 --> 15:04.804
We're Mountain Rescue,
not the mortuary service.

15:04.930 --> 15:06.212
He taught Evie.

15:08.787 --> 15:10.010
That his?

15:10.400 --> 15:11.680
Yeah, it was next to his body.

15:11.852 --> 15:13.590
Look, just... just leave it.

15:16.154 --> 15:18.754
DS Redford to Control. I'm
at the foot of Carn Mhor.

15:18.857 --> 15:22.319
I recognise the deceased
as... Niall Swift.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.360
Require full scenes of crime.

15:29.615 --> 15:32.197
Severe head injuries. Dr Marr attending.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.982
Annie? Full scenes of crime?

15:37.120 --> 15:39.960
- You think it's accidental?
- The guy took a header.

15:40.132 --> 15:41.234
Look...

15:42.337 --> 15:43.844
That's not accidental.

15:46.400 --> 15:48.760
We flew over in the Seahawk
about half an hour ago.

15:48.800 --> 15:49.984
What did you see?

15:51.033 --> 15:52.793
There was nothing out of the ordinary.

15:52.850 --> 15:54.407
It's a bad business.

15:58.733 --> 16:01.253
So you run here from the college?

16:01.586 --> 16:02.888
Yeah, every lunchtime.

16:02.914 --> 16:04.200
Did you see anybody?

16:04.736 --> 16:06.056
No, not on my run.

16:06.611 --> 16:09.234
After I found him, I borrowed
a phone from a woman.

16:09.306 --> 16:10.586
You get her name?

16:11.684 --> 16:13.501
Yeah. She gave me her details.

16:16.320 --> 16:17.685
Life extinct.

16:19.600 --> 16:21.653
Inform the Procurator Fiscal.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.680
Do you think someone killed him?

16:27.089 --> 16:29.960
Suspicious death. Get the tape.
Set up a cordon.

16:39.360 --> 16:41.064
So how many murders have you worked?

16:41.649 --> 16:44.449
This is Lochnafoy. Not that many.

16:44.699 --> 16:46.082
More than ten?

16:47.459 --> 16:48.647
None.

16:49.387 --> 16:50.400
If you must know.

16:50.440 --> 16:51.453
Right.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.196
Should I go and get my sleeping bag?

16:54.352 --> 16:55.471
What?

16:55.534 --> 16:57.165
You know, like, pull an all-nighter?

16:57.480 --> 16:59.720
Jason, the body's at the mortuary.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.821
Until we get the pathologist's
results there's nothing we can do.

17:03.480 --> 17:04.415
Oh.

17:07.714 --> 17:08.858
What?

17:10.419 --> 17:13.096
Niall's phone wasn't on him. I
thought it would be in here.

17:20.204 --> 17:21.758
Why would he do that?

17:31.687 --> 17:33.117
<i>How's it looking?</i>

17:34.120 --> 17:35.720
<i>The tail needs to be longer.</i>

17:35.760 --> 17:37.920
- <i>Evie...</i>
- Great.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.355
<i>..a seal's willy bone!</i>

17:45.814 --> 17:46.983
Hey.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.329
Did you get my message
about Niall Swift?

17:50.506 --> 17:53.200
Yeah, unbelievable. Just...

17:55.200 --> 17:57.682
- How's madam?
- A bit upset.

17:57.924 --> 17:59.600
Yeah, I'm a bit upset.

17:59.892 --> 18:01.105
Evie...

18:02.450 --> 18:03.917
I saw your wee film on YouTube.

18:03.943 --> 18:05.385
Yeah, I've talked to her about it.

18:05.411 --> 18:08.520
A man we all really liked is dead and
you two are on about a stupid joke?

18:08.722 --> 18:11.101
I will be on about it until you show
me you've wised up.

18:11.569 --> 18:13.880
- Not what Dad said.
- Oh, no? What did Dad say?

18:13.920 --> 18:15.498
- I never said anything.
- You did.

18:16.012 --> 18:18.720
I said it was a good day for takings.

18:18.760 --> 18:21.960
Because of what we did.
Best day this year.

18:22.000 --> 18:23.279
Down to me.

18:24.315 --> 18:25.613
Well done.

18:30.520 --> 18:32.263
You know the worst thing about today?

18:32.880 --> 18:35.254
Dr Marr acting like it was no big deal.

18:36.080 --> 18:39.520
- Niall taught Marr's wee girl.
- Did he?

18:40.354 --> 18:42.565
Said Marr always made
him feel uncomfortable.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.607
Not the only one.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.457
Is Kieran at home?

20:02.040 --> 20:04.991
I'm a friend. From college.

20:06.209 --> 20:07.566
He's with his brother.

20:09.854 --> 20:11.449
Can I say hi?

20:15.420 --> 20:16.980
In you come.

20:25.188 --> 20:26.785
Somebody to see you, Kieran.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.424
This is why you don't
invite anyone round.

20:43.880 --> 20:45.336
My mum told me.

20:45.560 --> 20:47.499
Does your mum know everyone's business?

20:47.657 --> 20:49.045
Pretty much.

20:49.960 --> 20:51.994
Cop thing. She never stops.

20:55.189 --> 20:56.869
Did you hear about my piano teacher?

20:59.641 --> 21:03.370
He died. They think it was
a climbing accident.

21:04.745 --> 21:05.810
Sorry.

21:14.350 --> 21:16.050
Can I do something to help?

21:16.367 --> 21:18.049
You wanna take him roller-blading?

21:18.670 --> 21:20.447
I could trim his fingernails.

21:21.480 --> 21:23.326
There's some scissors
in the drawer there.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.330
Jordan...

22:03.547 --> 22:05.632
..do you mind if I tell
Evie what happened?

22:06.418 --> 22:09.400
Does he respond?
Like blink or something?

22:09.927 --> 22:11.053
Not yet.

22:12.619 --> 22:14.059
Stop a second.

22:17.408 --> 22:19.286
He was a Scots Guard.

22:20.428 --> 22:24.360
After his last tour, he had an aneurysm.

22:25.515 --> 22:27.079
Before you moved here.

22:27.289 --> 22:28.329
Yeah.

22:28.840 --> 22:32.041
The doctors took ages to diagnose
Locked-In Syndrome.

22:33.061 --> 22:35.782
We had to fight to stop them
turning off his life support.

22:38.600 --> 22:41.814
He squeezed my hand. Oh, my God.

22:43.450 --> 22:44.955
It's just a spasm.

23:37.880 --> 23:39.247
DCI Quigley.

23:41.360 --> 23:42.547
Today?

23:42.848 --> 23:44.855
Well, I've got my interview today...

23:47.480 --> 23:49.760
OK. Well, I appreciate that.

23:50.056 --> 23:51.790
Who's in charge up there?

23:53.463 --> 23:54.973
Frank Smilie?

23:55.720 --> 23:57.640
No. No problem with that.

23:58.640 --> 23:59.805
OK.

24:02.714 --> 24:04.274
Frank Smilie...

24:14.120 --> 24:18.592
You're right. Niall Swift's fall
wasn't an accident.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.876
Inverness, come on.

24:25.830 --> 24:29.800
The Detective Superintendent's
picked his Senior Investigating Officer.

24:30.113 --> 24:33.096
I always knew the bastard hated me,
I just didn't know how much.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.120
He's picked Lauren Quigley.

24:37.289 --> 24:40.526
DCI? Glasgow Cathedral Street?

24:41.594 --> 24:42.951
English.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.565
I was her Sergeant when she started out.

24:46.240 --> 24:50.084
Fresh out of the box,
thought she was Serpico.

25:04.640 --> 25:07.758
I'm aware of your presence, Frank.
There's no need to bark.

25:08.274 --> 25:11.600
- DS Redford, you were the first officer?
- Yes, ma'am.

25:11.640 --> 25:14.721
You didn't find any long metal
implements at the scene, did you?

25:15.360 --> 25:17.849
Part of the pre-frontal
cortex is missing.

25:17.875 --> 25:19.720
And judging by the blood
pooled in the skull,

25:19.760 --> 25:23.068
it was removed via the nasal cavity
while the victim was still alive.

25:23.513 --> 25:25.680
Maybe his brain was hoicked out
through his nose.

25:25.720 --> 25:27.205
In broad daylight.

25:28.393 --> 25:30.835
You've a cold-blooded
predator in your town.

25:39.700 --> 25:43.700
I'll be bringing in my own team tonight,
which, given the slightly unconventional MO,

25:43.740 --> 25:47.260
will include Blake Albrighton.
He's a forensic psychologist.

25:47.300 --> 25:48.660
Oh, I know who he is.

25:48.700 --> 25:50.860
- This your first homicide, Frank?
- No.

25:50.900 --> 25:53.700
That's right, there was that
woman up in Park Circus.

25:53.726 --> 25:56.246
- Wasn't my first.
- It was mine.

26:07.422 --> 26:08.702
Bollocks.

26:42.460 --> 26:44.520
How well did you know Niall Swift?

26:45.180 --> 26:47.940
He came to our house once a
week for about three years.

26:47.980 --> 26:50.384
- To teach piano?
- Yeah, he was a decent guy.

26:50.438 --> 26:51.838
Liked a bit of goss.

26:52.274 --> 26:53.860
Enough to get him killed?

26:53.900 --> 26:55.534
It was pretty innocuous.

26:55.950 --> 26:57.980
Did he tell you who
he was sleeping with?

26:58.301 --> 27:01.101
No. He was there to teach my daughter.

27:01.900 --> 27:04.420
Tight little town, gay man.
How did that work?

27:05.429 --> 27:06.783
It worked fine.

27:07.109 --> 27:09.515
Here, you contribute, you're in.

27:10.180 --> 27:12.620
- Everybody loved him.
- Well, somebody didn't.

27:12.660 --> 27:14.197
- All right?
- Hiya.

27:22.700 --> 27:24.175
The beauty of nature.

27:25.771 --> 27:27.678
It bores the living shit out of me.

27:31.561 --> 27:32.760
Craig...

27:35.220 --> 27:38.763
Craig, what happened to you yesterday,
you need to talk about it.

27:39.822 --> 27:40.950
No, I don't.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.580
You found a dead body.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.580
You were white as a sheet
when you came home.

27:46.784 --> 27:48.333
Craig, please...

27:48.359 --> 27:51.743
Look, I just need some time on my own.

27:54.706 --> 27:56.268
Don't shut me out.

28:11.860 --> 28:15.110
- Any special significance to this area?
- No.

28:15.860 --> 28:18.980
Suicide spot? Meeting place for lovers?

28:19.020 --> 28:20.694
Doggers' paradise?

28:22.100 --> 28:23.540
It wasn't a coincidence, was it?

28:23.580 --> 28:27.287
I'm guessing Swift and our man
arranged to be here.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.981
- Have you got his phone?
- He didn't have it with him.

28:30.007 --> 28:31.869
- Who found him?
- Craig Petrie.

28:31.895 --> 28:33.260
Head of Lochnafoy College.

28:33.300 --> 28:35.249
OK, we'll make Petrie a priority.

28:35.275 --> 28:36.940
Any other locals I should know about?

28:36.980 --> 28:38.837
One. Out on licence.

28:39.110 --> 28:40.405
Leighton Thomas.

28:41.340 --> 28:44.180
So, he ties him down, a
fit and able-bodied man.

28:44.595 --> 28:46.315
Does the trick with the brain.

28:46.536 --> 28:48.940
Heaves him off the cliff,
all in broad daylight.

28:48.980 --> 28:50.408
Talk about high-risk.

28:50.609 --> 28:52.096
The grass there...

28:54.980 --> 28:58.149
- Deer do that?
- Deer don't come through here.

29:00.380 --> 29:01.495
Thank you.

29:22.136 --> 29:25.237
Local paper. Came out yesterday.

29:27.580 --> 29:29.856
Extend the cordon to
take in the whole area.

29:29.882 --> 29:31.829
You can tell the SOCO,
get himself down here.

29:31.855 --> 29:32.920
Yes, ma'am.

29:33.389 --> 29:36.020
- Why would anybody go in there?
- Hide?

29:37.940 --> 29:40.700
Mountain Rescue flew over just
before the body was found.

30:00.660 --> 30:02.260
I found something on Carn Mhor.

30:02.300 --> 30:05.700
I can't say what, but the SIO wants
me to be part of the team.

30:05.740 --> 30:08.770
Annie, you're talking about
somebody we both knew.

30:10.696 --> 30:11.808
Yeah.

30:12.260 --> 30:14.900
All I'm saying is, the SIO's
bringing in Blake Albrighton.

30:14.940 --> 30:17.964
- Who?
- Blake Albrighton, Alan.

30:17.990 --> 30:19.778
- You read his book.
- Did I?

30:20.358 --> 30:21.620
Forensic psychologist.

30:21.660 --> 30:24.500
He caught the Queensferry killer,
the crossbow guy in Bordeaux.

30:24.540 --> 30:26.820
- Oh, yeah. Clever guy. Tell me over lunch.
- I can't.

30:27.031 --> 30:28.991
- Come on, an hour or two.
- Alan, I need to go.

30:58.980 --> 31:02.220
- New people. That was fast.
- Oh, yes. See, there's been a murder...

31:02.260 --> 31:04.740
Oh, very good.
Experimenting with sarcasm.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.425
Can we have a word?

31:09.180 --> 31:10.464
What's happened?

31:11.253 --> 31:14.282
That was among the crap
found on the beach.

31:19.310 --> 31:21.070
What you have here is a human heart.

31:26.677 --> 31:28.717
Something's had a wee chew at it.

31:30.569 --> 31:31.934
It's gamey.

31:32.060 --> 31:35.337
I'd estimate it was removed
a week to ten days ago.

31:36.900 --> 31:38.701
Brains, hearts...

31:39.010 --> 31:40.574
What next, Annie?

31:45.620 --> 31:48.260
PC Denny had the area around
the bones cordoned off.

31:48.300 --> 31:51.763
It was my decision to incinerate
all foreign material on the shore.

31:52.060 --> 31:55.180
He said he didn't mention the heart
in case he got a bollocking.

31:55.220 --> 31:57.095
I'm sorry he felt like that.

31:57.268 --> 31:58.767
And the pranksters?

31:58.793 --> 32:02.620
John Joseph Patterson, Kieran
Whitehead, Evelyn Redford?

32:03.136 --> 32:04.515
My daughter.

32:04.541 --> 32:06.621
Have you any idea how bad this looks?

32:24.848 --> 32:27.282
- Have you disinfected that?
- Yeah.

32:27.743 --> 32:29.141
It stinks.

32:29.873 --> 32:31.335
Do it again.

32:35.630 --> 32:36.880
Frank.

32:38.048 --> 32:39.844
I'm guessing this ain't good.

32:42.433 --> 32:44.886
Is that the van they used to
get the stuff to the beach?

32:45.190 --> 32:46.313
Yeah.

32:48.070 --> 32:50.612
Jonjo, son. Could you
leave that just now?

32:52.550 --> 32:54.710
I'd give my right ball for a cup of tea.

32:56.230 --> 32:57.393
OK.

33:03.190 --> 33:04.785
The heart you brought in...

33:04.990 --> 33:06.910
- Human.
- Male.

33:06.950 --> 33:08.834
Over 50, apparently.

33:08.860 --> 33:11.510
- Not yours?
- No, I checked.

33:13.411 --> 33:15.891
If you could keep that
to yourself for now.

33:16.165 --> 33:18.630
We're going to have to talk to Jonjo

33:18.670 --> 33:21.670
and you can expect a visit
from the Inverness SOCOs.

33:21.710 --> 33:24.350
- Oh, what?
- You've a couple of hours.

33:24.390 --> 33:26.150
Get everything above board.

33:26.190 --> 33:29.510
It's not that. I've tons of beef
online. More arriving.

33:29.550 --> 33:32.646
My margins are practically
zero as it is.

33:33.275 --> 33:35.967
I'll talk to them. Push it back.

33:36.843 --> 33:38.779
I should've burned the thing.

33:45.034 --> 33:46.034
_

33:59.756 --> 34:00.837
Blake.

34:03.510 --> 34:07.190
Why did nobody tell me about
all this? I saw an actual stag.

34:07.299 --> 34:09.619
Balls bigger than mine.
Nearly crashed the car.

34:10.687 --> 34:13.567
- Glad you're here. - Right, we
need to call a press conference.

34:17.469 --> 34:20.550
I'm stood there thinking, "Have
these eejits not seen the uniform?"

34:20.590 --> 34:24.870
One of them's shouting, "We'll have to
let Sam drive! He's too pished to sing!"

34:24.909 --> 34:28.039
That's a stoater.

34:28.870 --> 34:30.870
He's here, sir. Blake Albrighton.

34:31.356 --> 34:32.870
OK.

34:33.273 --> 34:34.630
Er, the forensic psychologist...?

34:34.670 --> 34:37.270
Jason, I know who he is.
I'll be out when I'm ready.

34:42.239 --> 34:45.184
- Have you read his book?
- No. Skimmed it.

34:45.692 --> 34:47.395
That stuff about his sister.

34:47.690 --> 34:49.476
Imagine carrying that around with you.

34:49.735 --> 34:51.797
I bet he's got the next one all planned.

34:52.257 --> 34:55.054
How I Caught The Loch Ness Monster.

35:06.944 --> 35:08.224
Annie, what's up?

35:08.250 --> 35:10.669
Alan, can you bring Evie
down to the station, please?

35:13.030 --> 35:14.990
I can't OK a press conference.

35:15.030 --> 35:16.750
We don't know what we're dealing with.

35:17.179 --> 35:20.317
We're dealing with someone who's
killed twice and will kill again.

35:20.614 --> 35:23.670
The heart could've come from a
medical school or a grave.

35:23.710 --> 35:27.950
The same day a body is found with part
of its brain removed, a heart turns up

35:27.990 --> 35:29.630
and you think that's, what, bad luck?

35:29.935 --> 35:33.030
I don't believe in luck. I don't believe
in hunches or horse whisperers.

35:33.070 --> 35:35.590
- I believe in evidence.
- You're both Chief Inspectors.

35:35.630 --> 35:39.110
- Who's SIO?
- DCI Quigley runs the investigation.

35:39.150 --> 35:42.350
I run everything else, which would
include a press conference.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.070
Why do you think he'll kill again?
Assuming it's a "he".

35:45.110 --> 35:48.270
Oh, it's a "he". Mid-20s to mid-40s.

35:48.762 --> 35:51.510
His narrative's about how clever he is.
He needs power but...

35:51.550 --> 35:53.830
- We all need power.
- But this guy's different.

35:54.470 --> 35:56.790
The thing with the brain,
he's overdoing it.

35:56.830 --> 35:59.230
More than power, he needs to be admired.

35:59.445 --> 36:02.850
And you hold a press conference to
tell him how much you admire him?

36:04.190 --> 36:07.990
Look, I'm talking about
saving lives, OK?

36:08.030 --> 36:11.230
By giving him what he craves,
we satiate him for a while.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.204
Maybe long enough to
give us an advantage.

36:13.230 --> 36:14.795
And you get what you crave.

36:15.585 --> 36:16.804
Which is what?

36:16.830 --> 36:18.070
Publicity.

36:25.950 --> 36:29.190
He turned down a job in Boston
to be here. This is a favour.

36:29.440 --> 36:32.440
I've seen his fee. That's no favour.

36:34.717 --> 36:35.968
Wait!

36:38.910 --> 36:40.751
Chill. I'm just going to find a hotel.

36:43.345 --> 36:44.592
Wanna come?

36:45.550 --> 36:47.104
No, Blake, I don't.

36:55.190 --> 36:57.550
Niall Swift, 32 years old.

36:57.590 --> 36:59.907
Moved to Lochnafoy four years ago.

36:59.993 --> 37:02.910
Taught local kids piano,
started a choir.

37:02.950 --> 37:05.030
Organised performances for charity.

37:05.070 --> 37:08.990
No close attachments or
relatives that we know of.

37:09.870 --> 37:13.070
Threading together the available
pathology and forensics,

37:13.110 --> 37:16.670
Niall Swift met his killer on Carn Mhor.

37:16.943 --> 37:21.849
His wrists were bound with
a rope similar to this.

37:23.118 --> 37:24.758
Who stocks it locally?

37:24.784 --> 37:26.923
Do they remember anyone buying it?

37:27.230 --> 37:30.241
Billion dollar question:
where's his phone?

37:30.990 --> 37:35.670
For the officer who brings me a lead, I've
put something aside at the Oxfam Shop.

37:35.710 --> 37:38.070
- Ooh...
- I know, calm yourselves.

37:38.110 --> 37:42.790
And if that wasn't enough, we've
had this thrown into the mix.

37:43.470 --> 37:46.085
A little gift left on the beach.

37:46.230 --> 37:50.615
Until we find out otherwise, we'll treat
that as a separate murder investigation.

37:54.373 --> 37:55.692
I don't know.

37:56.311 --> 37:58.431
We all seemed to come up
with the idea together.

37:58.457 --> 38:00.565
I think I'd have to credit Evie with
that.

38:01.235 --> 38:05.230
It was Evie's idea. She asked
if I could get the bones.

38:06.260 --> 38:09.270
Mr Petrie says you should
always follow your instincts.

38:16.575 --> 38:18.001
It was horrible.

38:18.550 --> 38:20.230
Kieran and Jonjo were just dumping it.

38:20.270 --> 38:22.750
There could've been a heart there.
I didn't notice.

38:22.947 --> 38:26.790
If we'd seen a heart, we'd have been
arguing about where it should go.

38:26.830 --> 38:28.707
I think I would've remembered a heart.

38:29.332 --> 38:34.830
While we were laying out the bones, I
had a feeling we were being watched.

38:34.870 --> 38:36.670
You had a feeling? Did you see anyone?

38:37.233 --> 38:38.417
Nah.

38:38.730 --> 38:41.490
Look, I'm trying to establish
how the heart got there.

38:41.819 --> 38:44.819
If you saw someone, maybe they
put it there after you'd gone.

38:46.750 --> 38:48.470
I didn't see anyone.

38:49.470 --> 38:50.783
Wait there.

39:01.929 --> 39:03.245
Do you believe her?

39:03.561 --> 39:04.549
Yeah.

39:07.817 --> 39:09.937
Am I off the case?

39:10.905 --> 39:14.190
I'm going to let her go, but I strongly
recommend she does not leave the area.

39:14.230 --> 39:16.870
Right. DCI Quigley, am I...

39:16.910 --> 39:20.016
What are you at this moment?
A mother or a police officer?

39:25.313 --> 39:27.725
You're compromised. I'm sorry.

39:50.120 --> 39:52.120
- Are you off the case?
- What do you think?

39:53.205 --> 39:54.747
Where'd the heart come from?

39:55.098 --> 39:57.840
- What's the deal with the heart?
- It's human.

39:59.430 --> 40:00.550
Shit.

40:00.590 --> 40:02.625
Nobody knows about that,
so don't go blabbing.

40:02.872 --> 40:04.564
You need to tell me where you got it.

40:04.590 --> 40:06.790
We never saw any heart. How many times?

40:06.830 --> 40:08.430
Do you know some medical student?

40:08.470 --> 40:11.470
- Annie, you're not on the job now.
- I might not have a job!

40:11.510 --> 40:14.350
- She's pissed cos she messed up.
- Don't be such a rude little bitch!

40:14.390 --> 40:16.310
- Where'd you get it?
- I think that's enough.

40:16.350 --> 40:18.313
Do you? That's for you to
decide, is it? Evie...

40:18.339 --> 40:19.655
Evie!

40:44.430 --> 40:47.110
Mr McGrellish, just let
me give you something...

40:47.150 --> 40:50.670
I don't want any help. OK?

40:50.710 --> 40:52.630
Why won't you let me
contribute at least?

40:52.670 --> 40:53.897
Evie.

40:58.793 --> 41:00.073
I'd better go.

41:01.837 --> 41:03.195
Hi.

41:04.470 --> 41:06.790
- Sad day.
- Can you believe it?

41:07.074 --> 41:08.511
I mean, who could do a thing like that?

41:08.949 --> 41:11.110
- Have you called Bethan?
- Soon as I heard.

41:11.150 --> 41:13.230
Oh, Bethan was in bits.

41:13.270 --> 41:15.030
I've been messaging her.

41:15.265 --> 41:16.945
She hasn't had a minute to herself.

41:17.578 --> 41:19.841
Law degrees don't come
free with the Bunty.

41:57.230 --> 41:58.430
Hey.

41:59.671 --> 42:02.831
The new DCI needs you to check in
down at the station.

42:04.472 --> 42:05.892
I can't stay here.

42:07.954 --> 42:09.175
Course you can.

42:09.990 --> 42:11.456
The community needs you.

42:12.775 --> 42:14.775
What, you think this is a community?

42:16.390 --> 42:18.750
It's a bunch of people
drawn together by lies.

43:53.509 --> 43:55.047
_

43:56.217 --> 43:58.297
I... admire what they did.

43:58.470 --> 44:01.830
- He's lying about something.
- Got a bit defensive, didn't he.

44:01.870 --> 44:04.470
- Are you on the investigation team?
- No I'm not.

44:04.618 --> 44:07.058
I committed murder.
Is that what you wanna hear?

44:07.084 --> 44:09.613
- You got a taste for it?
- Yeah, it felt good.

44:11.830 --> 44:14.190
Oh, for fuck's sake. He's got a gun!

44:14.230 --> 44:16.190
We might be looking at another victim.

44:16.230 --> 44:19.350
If we can get that enhanced, we
could have the killer's handwriting.

44:19.390 --> 44:22.430
- What's going on?
- Somebody's trying to get us shut down.

44:24.590 --> 44:26.910
Now, most people, their
monsters are in here.

44:26.950 --> 44:28.710
Scratching to get out.
