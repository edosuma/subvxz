00:07.833 --> 00:10.445
he was the worst man in the
world,

00:10.619 --> 00:13.317
stubborn, arrogant, and the
biggest snob I have ever met.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.668
Now, I don't know if I've met a
better man

00:16.842 --> 00:18.105

00:20.237 --> 00:23.893
His stubbornness, arrogance, and
snobbery

00:24.067 --> 00:25.503
just serve as an exterior to
cover up

00:25.677 --> 00:27.592
a loyal, fastidious heart,

00:27.766 --> 00:31.335
which, once given to his
family and close friends,

00:31.509 --> 00:33.642
I think, might be given forever.

and so very funny when

know

01:30.960 --> 01:32.309

01:33.919 --> 01:36.400
I gave it my best.

01:36.574 --> 01:38.141
I was really nervous,

01:38.315 --> 01:40.448
and really worried about
the British accent,

01:41.840 --> 01:42.928
but I think it went well,

Good morning.

- Would either of you like to
tell me

04:12.948 --> 04:14.558
why I wasn't made aware

04:14.732 --> 04:16.908

04:18.257 --> 04:20.172
- You know very well which one.

- The actress is very talented,
Philippa,

04:22.043 --> 04:23.872
just magical on screen.

04:24.046 --> 04:25.613
She was on that Three Times a
Charm show,

04:25.787 --> 04:28.616
which was a very popular US web
series.

04:28.790 --> 04:30.357
- Web series.

04:30.531 --> 04:32.097
- Philippa, it's a little
unusual for an investor

04:32.272 --> 04:33.490
to be involved in casting
decisions,

04:33.664 --> 04:35.579
so I didn't think to consult
you,

04:35.753 --> 04:38.060
and we have Sophie's expert
eye here as a director.

this decision

04:39.975 --> 04:42.064

to play one of the most iconic
characters

04:47.548 --> 04:48.331
in English Literature.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.595
I would expect the producer of
this film

04:51.769 --> 04:54.511
to be more careful with
the money I've invested.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.383
- I can assure you Philippa,

04:56.557 --> 04:57.993
I have nothing in mind
other than your investment,

04:58.167 --> 05:00.038
and specifically the return on
it.

05:01.605 --> 05:03.172
- How so?

06:01.970 --> 06:03.885

06:04.059 --> 06:05.713
- Right, the accent.

You know, I'm actually an actor.

06:09.978 --> 06:11.283
I live in Atlanta,

06:11.458 --> 06:14.112
and started to take a few acting
classes,

06:14.286 --> 06:16.941
and I decided to start working
as a PA

06:17.115 --> 06:18.116
to get to know some of the
directors,

06:18.290 --> 06:19.509
and get a foot in the door.

bunch of online tutorials

08:51.443 --> 08:53.489
for dialect training.

08:53.663 --> 08:56.971
- Sure the budget isn't big
enough for an on set coach?

08:57.145 --> 08:59.190
- I suppose we are far from our
sweeping

08:59.364 --> 09:02.716

no expense would be spared,

09:02.890 --> 09:05.327
to insure accuracy and quality.

But then what can you expect
from a low-budget production?

you how thrilled I am

seat?

10:33.458 --> 10:35.243

10:35.417 --> 10:36.244

seeing as we're playing

10:36.418 --> 10:37.680
a couple on screen,

10:38.594 --> 10:39.900
might as well start behaving
like one.

in Three Times a Charm,

10:54.218 --> 10:56.090
So, how's the accent going?

10:56.264 --> 10:57.091

if one of your castmates will
help you?

11:00.094 --> 11:01.835
We only have two weeks to
rehearse,

11:02.009 --> 11:04.185
and our investor's very
particular about authenticity.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.143

be perfect

and of course such a talented
director.

11:44.965 --> 11:47.054
I'll be popping in and out of
rehearsals,

11:47.228 --> 11:48.882
but in the meantime,

11:49.056 --> 11:51.275
I'll leave you in Sophie's
very capable hands.

11:51.449 --> 11:52.886
Good luck to you all, and thank
you.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.806
- Okay, well I'm sure
you've all met by now,

11:59.980 --> 12:02.417
so we're just gonna do a
read-through from the top.

12:02.591 --> 12:04.288
So, Missus Bennet?

12:06.203 --> 12:09.990
- Mister Bennet, Netherfield
has been let at last.

12:11.469 --> 12:14.559
- I never thought a passing
could be this happy.

12:14.734 --> 12:16.257
- Whatever am I gonna do without
you?

12:16.431 --> 12:18.172
You must promise to visit every
week.

12:19.347 --> 12:21.610
- I will every day if I'm able.

12:21.784 --> 12:24.308
- No, we can't have you away
from Mister Bingley so often.

12:27.572 --> 12:28.399
Cannot.

12:29.966 --> 12:30.532
Cannot.

12:33.970 --> 12:35.667
- You must come and stay
with us at Netherfield.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.496
- So Mister Bingley has
made up his mind to stay?

12:38.670 --> 12:40.150
- He says he will not dream

12:40.324 --> 12:41.717
of keeping me away from my
family.

12:43.284 --> 12:44.372
Luckily, Caroline will be
spending

12:44.546 --> 12:46.069
most of her time in town so,

12:47.462 --> 12:48.811
we'll be far away from his.

12:48.985 --> 12:51.118
- Jane, that is the first unkind
thing

12:51.292 --> 12:52.728
I have ever heard you say.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.643
I've never been more
proud of you in my life.

12:57.254 --> 12:59.430
- I am sorry he brought
Mister Darcy with him.

12:59.604 --> 13:00.388
- I'm not, not.

13:02.956 --> 13:03.783
- Not.

13:05.219 --> 13:06.002
- I'm not.

13:07.047 --> 13:08.570
- Not bad.

13:08.744 --> 13:10.441
Let's slough through these last
few pages,

13:10.615 --> 13:11.834
and then we can break for lunch.

13:18.580 --> 13:19.973
- Oh, do you know what,
I'll be right back.

13:20.147 --> 13:21.452
I'm gonna use the restroom,

13:21.626 --> 13:22.192
don't let them start without me.

13:22.366 --> 13:23.019
- Okay.

13:31.985 --> 13:34.030
- [Liam] I understand
you have your reasons.

13:34.204 --> 13:35.510
- [Jackson] So why are you
questioning my decisions?

13:35.684 --> 13:36.554
- I'm not trying to disrespect
you here,

13:36.728 --> 13:38.165
I just assumed you'd hire

13:38.339 --> 13:40.558
an English actress with proper
training.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.082
- [Jackson] The accent will
improve.

13:42.256 --> 13:43.300
- We're only rehearsing for two
weeks.

13:43.474 --> 13:44.519
It's not enough time.

13:44.693 --> 13:45.999
- She's smart, she'll catch on.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.609
- I certainly hope so.

13:47.783 --> 13:49.306
I'll be a laughing stock back
home,

13:49.480 --> 13:51.352
if I play opposite a Lizzy
with an American accent.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.354
- She seemed to do well
today when you helped her.

13:53.528 --> 13:57.271
- No, no count on me to walk
her through every line, Sophie.

13:57.445 --> 13:58.446
I'm here to launch my American
career,

13:58.620 --> 14:00.622
not coach your actress.

14:00.796 --> 14:02.972
- Look, we're going to ask
everyone to pitch in to help
her.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.105
It's not just gonna be
your responsibility.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.194
- Well, where did she come from
anyway?

14:07.368 --> 14:10.240
Why hasn't she been trained in
accents?

14:10.414 --> 14:13.330
- She's had acting classes
with some really good coaches.

14:13.504 --> 14:14.505
- I've never seen her in
anything.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.681
What's her exact experience?

14:16.856 --> 14:18.988
- She has a very popular
channel on Watch It dot com.

14:19.162 --> 14:19.684
- I'm sorry.

14:21.121 --> 14:23.384
- She has a very popular
channel on Watch It dot com.

14:27.344 --> 14:28.693
- Are you kidding me?

14:28.868 --> 14:30.434
She's an internet star, that's
it?

14:30.608 --> 14:33.176
- Yes, she was on a very
successful web series,

14:33.350 --> 14:35.222
which she was excellent in.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.615
Now she has a channel
primarily focused on vlogging,

14:37.789 --> 14:39.879
but she's a very committed
actress.

14:41.793 --> 14:44.579
- Now I can't believe you would
cast her.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.320
She has no idea what she's
doing.

14:47.364 --> 14:48.148
- Okay,

14:49.671 --> 14:52.630
we have an out clause in her
contract for performance.

14:52.804 --> 14:53.805
How about, if she doesn't get
the accent

14:53.980 --> 14:55.285
by the time we start shooting,

14:56.460 --> 14:57.940
we'll recast her.

14:58.114 --> 14:59.463
- Oh so I'm supposed to
waste my time and energy

14:59.637 --> 15:00.638
on an actress who isn't even
going

15:00.812 --> 15:02.075
to end up playing the role?

15:02.249 --> 15:03.554
- She's going to get the accent,
Liam.

15:03.728 --> 15:05.295
I have every confidence that she
will.

15:05.469 --> 15:07.123
- Yeah well, I don't.

15:12.650 --> 15:15.915
[somber orchestral music]

15:19.875 --> 15:22.747
And I have come to the
conclusion that

15:24.619 --> 15:25.446
I love you.

15:25.620 --> 15:26.403
- You love me?

15:26.577 --> 15:27.361
- Yes.

15:28.275 --> 15:30.190
No, sincerely.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.192
- Oh you sincerely love me, for
how long?

15:32.366 --> 15:34.455
- What do you mean, for how
long?

15:34.629 --> 15:35.673
- At what point did you first
start

15:35.847 --> 15:37.632
developing affections for me?

15:37.806 --> 15:39.242
Was it say, your Aunt's dinner,

15:39.416 --> 15:40.069
or perhaps--

15:40.243 --> 15:40.765
- Perhaps.

15:41.723 --> 15:45.292
- Perhaps Mister Bingley's ball.

15:45.466 --> 15:46.641
- I cannot say for certain,

15:47.947 --> 15:50.384
but I believe it began when we
first met,

15:50.558 --> 15:51.211
at the Meryton assembly.

15:51.385 --> 15:51.951
- How odd.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.126
- Odd.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.170
- How odd.

15:55.519 --> 15:57.130
- In what way?

15:57.304 --> 15:58.696
- That you should
develop affections for me

15:58.870 --> 16:00.307
the very night you
refused to dance with me.

16:00.481 --> 16:02.744
- I told you, I have
no talent for dancing,

16:02.918 --> 16:05.660
nor for making conversation
with persons I've just met.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.618
I'm not like Mister Bingley.

16:07.792 --> 16:09.403
- Speaking of Mister Bingley,

16:09.577 --> 16:11.361
you claim to have affections for
me,

16:11.535 --> 16:13.233
but I believe you're
responsible for denying

16:13.407 --> 16:15.975
the future happiness of
my most beloved sister.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.890
- I do not claim to
have affection for you.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.415
I have stated that I love you.

16:21.589 --> 16:22.546
- Do you deny it?

16:22.720 --> 16:23.765
- Deny what?

16:23.939 --> 16:25.201
- Coming between two people

16:25.375 --> 16:26.159
who obviously care for each
other.

16:26.333 --> 16:27.987
- I don't deny it.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.466
Mister Bingley's very
effusive in his affections,

16:29.640 --> 16:31.251
and your sister--

16:31.425 --> 16:33.514
- Is not, but that does not
mean she feels any less.

16:33.688 --> 16:37.300
- Maybe not so hard on the
O's Kate, but good effort.

16:37.474 --> 16:40.390
I think we can all definitely
feel the vehemence from Lizzy.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.611
Let's take a 15 minute break,

16:43.785 --> 16:46.048
and then we can propel through
the rest of the script,

16:46.222 --> 16:46.788
and call it a day.

16:51.445 --> 16:54.143
- You don't have to coach me
if it's such an imposition.

16:54.317 --> 16:55.884
- Excuse me?

16:56.058 --> 16:57.668
- I'm sure you'd rather
focus on your own acting.

16:57.842 --> 16:59.627
I can find someone else to
help me with my dialect.

16:59.801 --> 17:02.108
- We've all been asked to help
you out,

17:02.282 --> 17:03.674
and I'd rather you get the
accent,

17:03.848 --> 17:05.154
than risk the quality of the
film.

17:06.502 --> 17:07.026
- Don't bother.

17:15.077 --> 17:16.948
Hi lovely people.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.080
So as promised, here's an update

17:19.255 --> 17:21.257
of my first day as Lizzy Bennet.

17:21.431 --> 17:23.564
So I just got settled into my
room,

17:23.738 --> 17:27.785
and I just finished my first
day of prep for the film.

17:27.959 --> 17:30.266
We went through the script
twice,

17:31.485 --> 17:33.443
I met quite a few of my costars.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.880
They're mostly polite,

17:37.404 --> 17:39.058
though I think the fact that I
am American

17:39.232 --> 17:40.537
does concern them a little bit.

17:41.886 --> 17:44.193
Oh, the girl playing Jane is so
nice.

17:44.367 --> 17:47.370
I think the two of us are
gonna end up being friends.

17:47.544 --> 17:50.808
I mean I guess they do have
a reason to be concerned.

17:50.982 --> 17:53.550
I'm struggling with the accent
more than I thought I would.

17:55.422 --> 17:58.077
But, this has been a really long
day,

17:58.251 --> 18:01.950
and I'm gonna run some
lines, and get to bed.

18:02.124 --> 18:04.387
So, have a good night, sweet
dreams,

18:04.561 --> 18:06.085
and remember to keep following
yours.

18:12.395 --> 18:16.051
[sentimental orchestral music]

18:21.448 --> 18:24.625
Oh my gosh, I am so sorry.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.714
- Hey hey, it's totally fine.

18:26.888 --> 18:28.455
I'm a klutz with coffee too.

18:28.629 --> 18:29.934
That's why I always where black.

18:30.109 --> 18:32.023
See, you can't even see the
stain.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.199
- Yeah, good looking ahead.

18:34.330 --> 18:36.985
- I'm Brad, I'm a PA.

18:37.159 --> 18:39.422
- Hi, I'm Kate, I'm playing
Lizzy.

18:39.596 --> 18:40.858
- Awesome.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.383
Well, good luck with rehearsals,

18:43.557 --> 18:46.255
and my name's on the call
sheet if you need anything.

18:46.429 --> 18:47.474
- Thanks.

18:47.648 --> 18:48.475
And I'm sorry, again.

18:52.479 --> 18:53.871
- My, he's a handsome one.

18:54.698 --> 18:55.438
- Brad?

18:55.612 --> 18:57.223
Yeah, I guess.

18:57.397 --> 18:58.485
- Well maybe not a good
enough match for you,

18:58.659 --> 19:00.139
you are the star of the movie.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.618
- Match?

19:01.792 --> 19:03.533
- Oh, do you have a boyfriend
already?

19:03.707 --> 19:05.318
- No, no and I'm not looking for
one.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.320
- Well, there's not a lot of
other options

19:07.494 --> 19:08.843
for you on this shoot.

19:09.017 --> 19:11.237
Ben seems quite taken with Julia
already.

19:12.455 --> 19:13.369
There is Liam.

19:17.547 --> 19:20.724
Exactly, what about that
actor that's playing Wickham?

19:20.898 --> 19:22.422
- Really Sarah, I don't want to
be

19:22.596 --> 19:24.337
romantically involved
with someone I work with.

19:24.511 --> 19:25.425
- Now how else are you
going to get your picture

19:25.599 --> 19:27.078
in the tabloids?

19:27.253 --> 19:28.689
It's the quickest way
to gain career traction.

19:30.125 --> 19:31.779
- You know what, I need to
get ready for rehearsal.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.433
I'll see you later.

19:33.607 --> 19:34.347
- Bye.

19:41.310 --> 19:42.746
- Do you dance, Mister Darcy?

19:44.313 --> 19:47.142
- Not if I can help it,
I have no talent for it,

19:48.404 --> 19:50.276
nor do I enjoy being forced
to make conversations

19:50.450 --> 19:52.147
with persons I've just met.

19:52.321 --> 19:54.018
- What a shame,

19:54.193 --> 19:55.759
for I find it to be one of
the true delights in life.

19:55.933 --> 19:57.848
- Your family seems to enjoy it.

19:58.022 --> 20:00.242
- If you're speaking of my
sister Jane,

20:00.416 --> 20:02.679
yes I do believe she does.

20:02.853 --> 20:04.115
Doesn't she look marvelous

20:04.290 --> 20:05.682
dancing with your friend, Mister
Bingley?

20:06.988 --> 20:08.816
- I think Lizzy would use that
last line

20:08.990 --> 20:10.121
as a bit more of a taunt.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.388
- Doesn't she look marvelous,

20:15.562 --> 20:17.303
dancing with your friend Mister
Bingley?

20:17.477 --> 20:19.435
- I was rather speaking of your
mother,

20:19.609 --> 20:20.828
and your younger sisters,

20:21.002 --> 20:22.046
who are apparently out in
society

20:22.221 --> 20:23.700
before the other are married.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.398
- Why should my younger
sisters be prevented

20:25.572 --> 20:27.051
from enjoying society,

20:27.226 --> 20:28.531
just because the elder
are not yet married?

20:30.359 --> 20:32.100
Not yet married?

20:33.928 --> 20:35.059
Not.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.236
- Okay, that's enough for now.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.499
Liam, do you mind helping Kate

20:39.673 --> 20:41.152
when she struggles with the
accent?

20:41.327 --> 20:43.416
- It's my fault, just working on
it.

20:43.590 --> 20:44.591
- Sorry, I'm just used to people

20:44.765 --> 20:46.245
who know how to speak properly.

20:49.944 --> 20:52.251
- [Sophie] Julia, Ben,
let's do your scene.

21:02.435 --> 21:05.176
[quiet piano music]

21:12.140 --> 21:13.968
- And how are you feeling
today, Miss Bennet?

21:14.142 --> 21:15.491
- A little better than
yesterday.

21:16.971 --> 21:19.190
I feel like maybe I
should go home tomorrow.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.322
- Mister Jones said
you are not to leave us

21:20.496 --> 21:22.237
until you are fully better.

21:22.411 --> 21:24.021
I cannot imagine that will be
tomorrow.

21:24.195 --> 21:27.634
- I do feel like I'm making
myself such an imposition.

21:27.808 --> 21:29.288
- Not at all.

21:29.462 --> 21:32.116
I am sorry it is under such
circumstances,

21:32.291 --> 21:34.075
but I could not be happier you
are here.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.687
- These two are very natural
together.

21:37.861 --> 21:39.776
It's almost like they're not
acting.

21:39.950 --> 21:40.690
- Yeah, they're great.

21:43.389 --> 21:44.085
What?

21:47.828 --> 21:49.090
- She better not get any ideas.

21:50.526 --> 21:51.527
- Ideas?

21:51.701 --> 21:52.223
- About Ben.

21:55.139 --> 21:57.359
- What's the problem,
does he have a girlfriend?

21:57.533 --> 21:58.099
- No.

22:01.929 --> 22:03.800
Ben is from a very
prominent acting family.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.804
Many young actresses have gone
after him,

22:07.978 --> 22:10.285
hoping to get a leg up in the
industry.

22:10.459 --> 22:12.243
- Julia is so sweet, she
wouldn't do that.

22:13.680 --> 22:14.594
- I wouldn't be so sure.

22:17.292 --> 22:20.513
- I feel sorry for you, if
this is how you view people.

22:20.687 --> 22:22.515
- I guess you've never had
the unfortunate experience

22:22.689 --> 22:25.474
of being taken advantage
of by another person.

22:25.648 --> 22:27.302
- I have had the misfortune,

22:27.476 --> 22:28.738
but I choose not to let it
affect

22:28.912 --> 22:30.740
my interactions with other
people.

22:30.914 --> 22:32.133
- Fantastic.

22:32.307 --> 22:33.526
That's all for today, thanks.

22:35.963 --> 22:37.138
- Let us go then.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.358
- Great job today, guys.

22:41.838 --> 22:43.362
- Kate, can I talk to you for a
second.

22:43.536 --> 22:44.580
- [Kate] Sure.

22:44.754 --> 22:45.451
- I'll see you tomorrow, Kate.

22:48.802 --> 22:49.846
- The accent.

22:50.020 --> 22:51.500
- I know, I'm trying.

22:51.674 --> 22:53.415
I think I was just a
little bit nervous today.

22:53.589 --> 22:55.896
- Ask some of your castmates to
help you.

22:56.070 --> 22:58.638
You have to get it before we
start shooting otherwise--

22:58.812 --> 22:59.552
- I know.

22:59.726 --> 23:00.161
I understand.

23:03.469 --> 23:06.167
[soft jazz music]

23:18.179 --> 23:20.224
- So, what do we have here?

23:20.399 --> 23:22.575
- Hi, I'm just working on my
lines.

23:22.749 --> 23:23.967
- And the accent?

23:25.795 --> 23:27.754
- I'm struggling with
it more than I expected.

23:29.712 --> 23:30.887
Actually, do you have a couple
of minutes

23:31.061 --> 23:31.801
to help me work on it?

23:33.063 --> 23:33.847
- Of course.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.677
- Thanks.

23:37.851 --> 23:39.026
I really appreciate it.

23:39.200 --> 23:40.984
- Please, don't mention it.

23:42.159 --> 23:42.943
Do you want to start here?

23:43.117 --> 23:43.900
- Yes.

23:52.996 --> 23:54.345
Come Miss Lizzy,

23:54.520 --> 23:55.869
let us take a walk about the
room.

24:01.309 --> 24:03.485
It is so refreshing, is it not,

24:03.659 --> 24:05.661
after sitting for so long?

24:05.835 --> 24:07.794
- It is a small sort of
accomplishment I suppose.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.404
- Mister Darcy.

24:09.578 --> 24:11.101
- [Sophie] Hold on a moment,
Miss Emilia.

24:11.275 --> 24:12.451
Let's run that line again
if you don't mind, Kate.

24:13.800 --> 24:15.845
- What words did I say
incorrectly?

24:16.019 --> 24:17.586
Small accomplishment?

24:17.760 --> 24:19.066
- It sounded perfectly fine to
me.

24:20.546 --> 24:21.677
- From your line, Emilia.

24:23.723 --> 24:25.986
- It is so refreshing is it not,

24:26.160 --> 24:28.162
after sitting for so long?

24:28.336 --> 24:29.903
- It is a small sort of
accomplishment, I suppose.

24:30.077 --> 24:31.731
- Sort.

24:31.905 --> 24:34.429
- It is a small sort of
accomplishment, I suppose.

24:35.996 --> 24:37.563
- Mister Darcy,

24:37.737 --> 24:39.260
would you care to join us
in a turn about the room?

24:39.434 --> 24:41.784
- I shall pass on your
kind request, Caroline.

24:41.958 --> 24:44.831
- Too wrapped up in your work
to enjoy a healthy jaunt?

24:45.005 --> 24:45.614
- Not at all.

24:46.746 --> 24:48.530
In fact there can only be two
reasons

24:48.704 --> 24:51.315
for you and Miss Lizzy to be
in your present occupation.

24:51.490 --> 24:53.187
Either you are in each other's
confidence,

24:53.361 --> 24:54.580
and my presence would prevent
your

24:54.754 --> 24:56.538
being able to confide your
secrets,

24:57.452 --> 24:58.888
or you are aware that your
figures

24:59.062 --> 25:00.760
are best observed from a
distance,

25:02.022 --> 25:04.111
and if I walked right beside
you, I could not admire them.

25:04.285 --> 25:05.808
- Mister Darcy,

25:05.982 --> 25:07.636
we are shocked are we not, Miss
Elizabeth?

25:07.810 --> 25:08.419
- Absolutely.

25:11.684 --> 25:14.425
- I like this, we need
to shift this over here.

25:14.600 --> 25:15.557
Others in--

25:15.731 --> 25:17.080
- You guys wanted to talk?

25:17.254 --> 25:18.038
- Kate, come in.

25:19.648 --> 25:21.041
- I know what you're gonna say,
I'm sorry,

25:21.215 --> 25:22.259
I don't know what to do.

25:22.433 --> 25:23.173
I even asked Emilia for help.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.219
- We have an idea.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.830
Why don't you take tomorrow
off, and get some down time?

25:29.789 --> 25:30.746
- That might help.

25:33.053 --> 25:34.794
I am really tired and
it's only been two days.

25:34.968 --> 25:35.751
- There we go.

25:36.926 --> 25:38.537
Do some more online dialect
tutorials,

25:38.711 --> 25:40.930
and join us for rehearsals
in the afternoon.

25:41.104 --> 25:42.802
- Thank you guys for
understanding.

25:42.976 --> 25:43.716
I'll see you tomorrow afternoon.

25:43.890 --> 25:44.630
- Okay.

25:49.591 --> 25:51.245
- I don't like what we're doing
here.

25:51.419 --> 25:53.160
- I don't like what we're doing,
either.

25:53.334 --> 25:55.641
But what if she never gets the
accent?

25:55.815 --> 25:57.860
We need another option for
Lizzy.

25:58.034 --> 25:59.383
- I know, it's just so
dishonest.

26:02.865 --> 26:04.867
- I'm actually more of
a whiskey girl myself.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.347
- Really?

26:06.521 --> 26:07.522
They've got a lovely Scotch
selection

26:07.696 --> 26:09.568
at the patio bar downstairs.

26:09.742 --> 26:10.481
Would you like to go?

26:11.657 --> 26:13.049
- Sure, when?

26:14.181 --> 26:15.574
- Are you busy now?

26:15.748 --> 26:17.706
- Hey guys, what's going on?

26:17.880 --> 26:19.099
- Well, were just thinking of
going

26:19.273 --> 26:20.361
and grabbing a drink a the patio
bar.

26:20.535 --> 26:22.189
- That sounds amazing,

26:22.363 --> 26:24.365
I could really use one of those
right now,

26:25.975 --> 26:28.674
but you know, it's been a really
long day.

26:28.848 --> 26:29.979
I think I'm just gonna go back
to my room,

26:30.153 --> 26:31.241
and order some room service.

26:31.415 --> 26:32.591
- No, don't be silly, come on.

26:32.765 --> 26:33.548
Come with us.

26:33.722 --> 26:35.245
Liam?

26:35.419 --> 26:36.377
You'll come and have a
drink with us, won't you?

26:37.073 --> 26:38.379
- Sure.

26:38.553 --> 26:40.207
- Great, look I'll text Emilia

26:40.381 --> 26:41.600
and we'll get the whole gang
together.

26:43.689 --> 26:44.690
- You coming?

26:44.864 --> 26:45.604
- I guess so.

26:46.735 --> 26:47.562
- Great.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.742
- Do remember the night
that actress playing Hermana

26:53.916 --> 26:55.439
forgot all her lines?

26:55.614 --> 26:58.268
- [Liam] Mmm yeah, I
had to feed them to her

26:58.442 --> 27:00.880
under my breath all night.

27:01.054 --> 27:03.534
I was never so happy for a
performance to end in my life.

27:03.709 --> 27:05.449
- It must be so
frustrating having a costar

27:05.624 --> 27:06.450
you had to coach along.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.018
Luckily they fired her once they
realized

27:09.192 --> 27:10.454
she wasn't a true professional.

27:12.065 --> 27:14.241
- She wasn't a very good actress
though,

27:14.415 --> 27:16.635
it wasn't just not being able to
memorize.

27:19.594 --> 27:21.465
- You know, you are an amazing
Demetrius.

27:22.989 --> 27:24.033
I have to say it was my pleasure

27:24.207 --> 27:26.122
getting to play your Hannah.

27:26.296 --> 27:27.994
- Kate, have you done
Shakespeare?

27:28.168 --> 27:29.648
- No I haven't,

27:29.822 --> 27:30.823
not since high school.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.346
- Not surprised.

27:32.520 --> 27:34.000
- I don't really like him, to be
honest.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.828
- Isn't that sacrilegious for
the British?

27:36.002 --> 27:37.873
- It's more like a son
rebelling against his father.

27:42.138 --> 27:44.750
- I don't know, it looks
like someone has some fans.

27:48.275 --> 27:49.624
- We're so sorry to disturb you,

27:49.798 --> 27:50.930
but would you mind taking a
photo?

27:51.104 --> 27:52.453
- Of course.

27:52.627 --> 27:54.020
It's so refreshing meeting
Americans

27:54.194 --> 27:56.109
who recognize British theater
actors.

27:56.283 --> 27:58.067
- Oh, we meant Kate.

27:58.241 --> 27:59.242
Do you mind?

27:59.416 --> 28:00.722
- No, of course not.

28:00.896 --> 28:02.724
- Would you mind taking the
photo?

28:02.898 --> 28:04.117
- Excuse me.

28:04.291 --> 28:05.466
I need to find the loo.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.991
- I can take your picture, here.

28:09.165 --> 28:09.905
- [Girl] Oh thank you.

28:14.867 --> 28:16.651
- One, two, three.

28:16.825 --> 28:19.480
[shutter clicking]

28:21.308 --> 28:22.831
- We just love you so much,

28:23.005 --> 28:24.572
you have no idea how
much you've helped me.

28:24.746 --> 28:25.573
- Oh honey, come here.

28:28.097 --> 28:29.925
- Thank you for everything.

28:30.099 --> 28:30.621
- You're welcome.

28:34.625 --> 28:36.802
- So does that happen to you a
lot?

28:36.976 --> 28:40.022
- Not all the time, just
sometimes.

28:40.196 --> 28:43.112
- Kate's quite famous, she
has a lot of subscribers.

28:43.286 --> 28:45.027
- [Ben] Really? How many?

28:45.201 --> 28:46.028
- I'm not sure.

28:46.202 --> 28:47.813
- Eight million.

28:47.987 --> 28:48.944
- How could you know that?

28:50.206 --> 28:53.253
- I'm one of them, I love your
channel.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.255
And I watched Three Times
a Charm religiously.

28:55.429 --> 28:58.171
- Kate, Emilia tells me
she's been helping you

28:58.345 --> 28:59.738
with the accent?

28:59.912 --> 29:01.652
- Yeah, she was helping me last
night.

29:01.827 --> 29:04.786
I thought I had it down but
it didn't go so well today.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.745
- Maybe you shouldn't
ask her for help anymore.

29:09.617 --> 29:12.098
- Well, I needed help and she
offered.

29:21.847 --> 29:24.371
Excuse me, I'm gonna go back to
my room.

29:24.545 --> 29:27.374
Have a good night, I'll
see you guys tomorrow.

29:27.548 --> 29:28.331
- Okay, have a good night.

29:28.505 --> 29:29.115
- Yeah, goodnight.

29:29.289 --> 29:29.942
- You too.

29:32.945 --> 29:34.642
- Thank you for the
stimulating conversation.

29:41.823 --> 29:44.043
Good morning, beautiful people.

29:44.217 --> 29:45.522
Just wanted to give
you guys a quick update

29:45.696 --> 29:47.394
on how rehearsals are going.

29:47.568 --> 29:50.223
Things have been crazy.

29:50.397 --> 29:52.312
I have crammed so many lines in
my brain,

29:52.486 --> 29:55.054
I don't even know how to
form a sentence anymore.

29:57.012 --> 29:59.362
I knew this was gonna be hard
but,

29:59.536 --> 30:01.277
I didn't expect to be so
difficult

30:01.451 --> 30:03.627
to get the British accent.

30:03.802 --> 30:06.108
I don't know why, I mean I have
watched

30:06.282 --> 30:09.024
tons of British films and TV
shows,

30:09.198 --> 30:11.592
and I even downloaded a
couple of online tutorials,

30:13.159 --> 30:14.203
but I only seem to get it right

30:14.377 --> 30:16.379
when this one actor corrects me,

30:16.553 --> 30:19.818
and it's just rude the
way he goes about it.

30:20.993 --> 30:23.212
He's such a snob and he just
thinks

30:23.386 --> 30:24.605
he's above everyone else.

30:26.085 --> 30:27.434
I understand that Lizzy Bennet

30:27.608 --> 30:28.609
needs a proper British accent
but,

30:33.092 --> 30:35.007
this is my dream,

30:35.181 --> 30:37.661
and I'm gonna figure it
out or I'm gonna get fired.

30:39.707 --> 30:41.013
I know it's not what
you guys want to hear,

30:41.187 --> 30:42.841
but I promised I would be honest
with you.

30:44.407 --> 30:47.976
Well, wish me well, and until
next time,

30:48.150 --> 30:49.064
keep chasing your dreams.

30:53.155 --> 30:56.202
[soft orchestral music]

31:33.804 --> 31:35.154
- So what's the verdict?

31:35.328 --> 31:36.677
Anything look good?

31:36.851 --> 31:39.506
- Uh, the Eggs Benedict looks
great.

31:39.680 --> 31:41.029
- You stole that from us, you
know.

31:41.203 --> 31:43.118
- I'm pretty sure it's American.

31:43.292 --> 31:45.555
- Well, seeing how this
country used to be English,

31:45.729 --> 31:48.341
I think we can safely claim
the beloved breakfast dish.

31:48.515 --> 31:49.864
- I think it's actually
more of a brunch dish,

31:50.038 --> 31:52.823
but I'm from LA, and we live for
brunch.

31:52.998 --> 31:54.477
- LA?

31:54.651 --> 31:56.088
You're not in town for the film,
are you?

31:56.262 --> 31:57.263
- I am, are you?

31:57.437 --> 31:58.829
I haven't seen you at rehearsal.

31:59.004 --> 32:00.222
- I wrapped on another film
yesterday,

32:00.396 --> 32:01.963
and hopped straight on the
plane.

32:02.137 --> 32:03.704
I don't think I've slept in 36
hours.

32:05.097 --> 32:06.272
- And you're playing?

32:06.446 --> 32:07.926
- Mister Wickham, at your
service.

32:09.144 --> 32:10.145
I'm Will.

32:10.319 --> 32:11.059
- Kate.

32:12.278 --> 32:13.192
- You're playing Lizzy.

32:13.366 --> 32:13.975
- How did you know?

32:15.455 --> 32:17.587
Oh yeah, American.

32:17.761 --> 32:19.676
- Well, that settles it then.

32:19.850 --> 32:21.243
- Settles what?

32:21.417 --> 32:22.679
- I'm treating you to breakfast
here,

32:22.853 --> 32:24.072
then accompanying you to
rehearsals,

32:24.246 --> 32:25.204
so we can get to know each
other.

32:27.206 --> 32:27.771
- Okay.

32:29.817 --> 32:32.733
[soft piano music]

32:36.476 --> 32:38.260
- Our waiter lost his mind,

32:38.434 --> 32:39.305
so I said, look,

32:39.479 --> 32:41.002
I'm sorry sir,

32:41.176 --> 32:42.134
it's just the name of
the desert in England,

32:42.308 --> 32:43.744
I didn't mean to offend you.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.180
- I can't believe you said that.

32:45.354 --> 32:46.442
- Yeah, he kind of deserved it
too.

32:48.879 --> 32:49.445
- Will?

32:51.056 --> 32:52.579
- Emilia, I wondered when it
would be when I ran into you.

32:52.753 --> 32:55.408
- Yes, so lovely to see you too,
darling.

32:55.582 --> 32:56.975
- Well now that you've arrived,

32:57.149 --> 32:58.846
it's gonna finally pick up
around here.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.282
- Did anyone say rehearsal?

33:00.456 --> 33:01.805
I thought we all had the morning
off.

33:02.719 --> 33:05.244
- Sophie just wanted me
to work on some blocking.

33:05.418 --> 33:07.115
Yeah, you definitely
weren't supposed to be here.

33:07.289 --> 33:07.811
Don't worry.

33:10.205 --> 33:12.686
- Oh Kate, Sophie's just
finishing up a call,

33:12.860 --> 33:14.296
but we're almost ready to start.

33:14.470 --> 33:17.952
- All right.

33:18.126 --> 33:19.127
- All right well, I'd better pop
up

33:19.301 --> 33:20.433
to my room and get some rest.

33:20.607 --> 33:21.912
Kate, lovely to meet you,

33:22.087 --> 33:23.349
and we'll try rehearsals.

33:23.523 --> 33:24.785
- Let me walk you to your room.

33:30.791 --> 33:32.793
[mumbling]

33:34.795 --> 33:36.666
- When did you meet Will?

33:36.840 --> 33:38.668
- We met this morning.

33:38.842 --> 33:40.366
- You two seem like old pals
already,

33:41.932 --> 33:43.934
but I guess he has that affect
on people.

33:44.109 --> 33:44.979
- You know him?

33:45.153 --> 33:45.806
- Yes.

33:48.548 --> 33:49.331
Look I,

33:51.072 --> 33:52.682
I realize you're a little naive
but.

33:52.856 --> 33:53.770
- Okay guys.

33:53.944 --> 33:55.729
I'm sorry, I'm ready.

33:55.903 --> 33:56.991
- Be careful who you trust.

33:57.165 --> 33:58.949
- Why?

33:59.124 --> 34:00.603
- I'm trying to help you from
making a fool of yourself.

34:09.830 --> 34:11.571
- And action.

34:11.745 --> 34:13.181
- And what about Mister Wickham?

34:13.355 --> 34:14.268
- Mister Wickham?

34:14.443 --> 34:16.184
- Yes, Mister Wickham.

34:16.358 --> 34:18.143
Can you explain why you went
against your father's will

34:18.317 --> 34:19.708
and left poor Mister
Wickham without a living?

34:19.882 --> 34:21.668
- Oh yes, poor Mister Wickham.

34:22.842 --> 34:24.018
A pretty face and sad story

34:24.192 --> 34:25.193
will always win a lady's
sympathy.

34:25.367 --> 34:26.847
- I am not that kind of lady.

34:27.021 --> 34:28.936
- Pray, tell me, dear madam,

34:29.110 --> 34:30.545
what kind of lady are you?

34:30.719 --> 34:31.591
- Apparently the kind that is
offered

34:31.764 --> 34:33.114
a declaration of love,

34:33.288 --> 34:34.855
while also enduring insults
regarding

34:35.029 --> 34:36.987
one's family and choice of
friends.

34:37.161 --> 34:40.730
- Am I to delight in the
inferiority of your birth,

34:40.904 --> 34:42.775
the blatant crassness of your
family,

34:42.949 --> 34:44.038
and your surprisingly gullible
nature,

34:44.212 --> 34:45.996
which has led you to believe

34:46.170 --> 34:48.389
that Mister Wickham is the
kind of person to call friend?

34:48.563 --> 34:50.871
- Mister Darcy,

34:51.045 --> 34:52.612
I feel compelled to inform you

34:52.786 --> 34:54.657
that from the very first
moment of our acquaintance,

34:54.831 --> 34:56.790
your arrogance, conceit,

34:56.964 --> 34:59.053
and selfish disdain for
the feelings of others,

34:59.227 --> 35:00.750
has led me to believe that you
are

35:00.924 --> 35:03.231
the very last man on Earth

35:03.405 --> 35:04.885
I could be prevailed upon to
marry.

35:07.105 --> 35:08.018
- You have said enough,

35:09.237 --> 35:09.890
Miss Lizzy.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.808
Thank you, for making your
feelings known.

35:16.418 --> 35:18.159
I am sorry that my affection
and offer of marriage

35:18.333 --> 35:19.073
have offended you so.

35:21.728 --> 35:22.903
I'll take care not to repeat
them.

35:25.688 --> 35:26.515
- Cut.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.868
That was breathtaking.

35:32.042 --> 35:32.869
- The accent.

35:33.043 --> 35:34.044
- Barely noticeable.

35:34.219 --> 35:35.089
- No, I got so many words wrong.

35:35.263 --> 35:36.656
- We'll work on it.

35:36.830 --> 35:39.267
These performances were amazing.

35:39.441 --> 35:41.661
I really believe that you hated
him.

35:41.835 --> 35:43.402
Liam, wasn't she fantastic?

35:44.794 --> 35:46.796
So, Spencer the costume designer
is here.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.407
Let's get you over to wardrobe

35:48.581 --> 35:49.321
to try on what he has in mind
for Lizzy.

35:49.495 --> 35:50.017
- Okay.

35:53.890 --> 35:55.849
- So, what do you think?

35:58.852 --> 36:01.159
- It's beautiful, I love it.

36:01.333 --> 36:03.335
- Well we're dressing Lizzy in
all blues.

36:03.509 --> 36:05.685
The day dress will be more
muted.

36:05.859 --> 36:07.513
- [Julia] Is it all right to
come out now?

36:07.687 --> 36:09.515
- Yes girl, come out here
and show us what you've got.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.909
- That is so pretty on you.

36:13.083 --> 36:14.955
- Now get up on the platform,

36:16.435 --> 36:17.436
and give it a twirl.

36:20.439 --> 36:21.701
- What color is the day dress?

36:21.875 --> 36:23.703
- Deep rose girl, deep rose.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.748
Jane is all about the pinks and
roses.

36:30.797 --> 36:31.841
- It's a bit pink.

36:32.015 --> 36:32.929
Isn't it?

36:33.103 --> 36:33.843
- You look beautiful.

36:35.062 --> 36:36.411
And how are things with Ben?

36:36.585 --> 36:39.675
- I don't know, he hasn't texted
me today.

36:39.849 --> 36:40.937
- That's strange.

36:41.111 --> 36:41.982
- I thought he liked me.

36:43.679 --> 36:44.811
Now I'm not quite sure.

36:46.029 --> 36:47.117
I suppose I said something wrong

36:47.292 --> 36:48.249
while we were out for drinks.

36:48.423 --> 36:49.163
- No, what could you have said?

36:49.337 --> 36:50.904
You were lovely.

36:51.078 --> 36:52.906
Maybe he's just memorizing
lines or something.

36:54.429 --> 36:55.082
- Yeah, maybe.

36:56.953 --> 36:59.042
- And I'm sure he'll ask you out
again,

36:59.217 --> 37:01.001
and hopefully this time you
won't have any tag-alongs.

37:03.873 --> 37:04.831
- And how are things with Liam?

37:05.005 --> 37:06.789
- What do you mean?

37:06.963 --> 37:09.749
- With rehearsing the accent
and him being a jerk to you?

37:09.923 --> 37:12.273
- It's okay, I just wish
he wasn't the only one

37:12.447 --> 37:14.057
who could get me to say things
correctly,

37:14.232 --> 37:15.972
which makes me dislike him even
more.

37:18.888 --> 37:19.933
- You know the actor playing
Wickham

37:20.107 --> 37:21.326
is supposed to arrive today.

37:21.500 --> 37:22.849
- Will, yes, I've met him.

37:24.807 --> 37:26.331
Super cute.

37:26.505 --> 37:28.942
[giggling]

37:29.116 --> 37:30.509
- You don't want to join your
sisters

37:30.683 --> 37:32.337
picking hats and gloves for the
ball?

37:32.511 --> 37:35.209
- I have no desire to spend
money for those things,

37:35.383 --> 37:36.819
and you?

37:36.993 --> 37:39.169
I'm sure Lydia would welcome
your opinion

37:39.344 --> 37:40.867
regarding her choice of finery.

37:42.129 --> 37:43.217
- I have no eye for such things.

37:44.305 --> 37:45.611
I was hoping to speak to you

37:45.785 --> 37:46.612
about the gentleman you just
met.

37:46.786 --> 37:47.787
- Mister Darcy?

37:47.961 --> 37:49.179
- Yes, do you know him well?

37:50.311 --> 37:52.052
- We've met on a few occasions.

37:54.184 --> 37:55.447
Would you like me to introduce
you?

37:55.621 --> 37:58.058
- No, we're already
well-acquainted.

38:00.278 --> 38:01.888
You're surprised?

38:02.062 --> 38:03.411
- You said nothing to each
other.

38:03.585 --> 38:05.108
- I'm afraid the way we last
parted,

38:05.283 --> 38:06.806
forever destroyed our
friendship.

38:08.024 --> 38:10.026
- I don't mean to pry.

38:10.200 --> 38:11.811
- Oh, I have no problem
telling you this story,

38:11.985 --> 38:12.942
if you wish to hear it?

38:13.116 --> 38:13.987
- I do.

38:14.161 --> 38:14.727
- Hang on a second guys.

38:17.251 --> 38:18.731
- Shall we continue our stroll?

38:23.170 --> 38:24.954
- How do you know Liam?

38:25.128 --> 38:26.608
- He told you we knew each
other?

38:26.782 --> 38:27.783
- Yes.

38:27.957 --> 38:29.655
- Did he say anything about me?

38:29.829 --> 38:32.092
- No, but it is weird that
he didn't acknowledge you.

38:34.224 --> 38:35.530
- Well, I assume it's
because he's turned biased

38:35.704 --> 38:37.140
towards somebody he stole a part
from.

38:38.490 --> 38:40.056
- No, he didn't.

38:42.537 --> 38:43.712
I know he's a snob and
everything,

38:43.886 --> 38:46.106
but that's terrible, what
happened?

38:47.673 --> 38:49.979
- I'd hate to give you a
bad opinion on the guy.

38:51.241 --> 38:52.939
- It's fine, I already have one.

38:54.636 --> 38:57.073
- In that case, we we're
both up for the lead role

38:57.247 --> 38:59.728
on this amazing new production
of Kafka's Metamorphosis.

39:01.034 --> 39:02.775
I nailed the audition.

39:02.949 --> 39:04.733
I knew the director wanted
me for the bug character.

39:04.907 --> 39:05.865
- Gregor?

39:06.039 --> 39:07.127
- Yeah, that guy.

39:07.301 --> 39:09.347
But, Liam calls the director,

39:09.521 --> 39:10.913
and tells him a whole
bunch of lies about me,

39:11.087 --> 39:12.959
how I'd like ditch rehearsal,

39:13.133 --> 39:15.004
or walk out on performances.

39:15.178 --> 39:17.224
He even said that I might leave
the production altogether,

39:17.398 --> 39:18.704
if something better came along.

39:18.878 --> 39:20.358
- That's terrible.

39:20.532 --> 39:23.012
- I mean all completely untrue,
of course.

39:24.274 --> 39:27.365
Thus, the director, so
convinced by Liam's claims,

39:27.539 --> 39:30.324
that he fired me, hired him for
the role.

39:30.498 --> 39:31.586
- I can't believe that.

39:33.283 --> 39:34.937
- You know what the worst part
is?

39:35.111 --> 39:36.939
That play was a huge hit.

39:37.113 --> 39:39.159
It actually propelled him into
stardom.

39:41.161 --> 39:43.032
And here he is now,

39:43.206 --> 39:44.686
booking all the lead roles,

39:44.860 --> 39:46.427
so I'm stuck playing
supporting characters.

39:46.601 --> 39:47.733
- I'm so sorry, Will.

39:49.256 --> 39:51.563
I can't believe he did that to
you.

39:51.737 --> 39:54.392
- Yeah, well, I guess I just
have to get used to the fact

39:54.566 --> 39:57.220
that Liam's always gonna come
out on top.

39:57.395 --> 40:00.310
Unlike him, I'm not gonna fight
dirty.

40:00.485 --> 40:04.184
- No, Will, you are a super
handsome guy,

40:04.358 --> 40:05.446
and you must be really talented

40:05.620 --> 40:07.405
if you originally had that role.

40:07.579 --> 40:09.189
You'll get a leading role, I'm
sure of it.

40:11.234 --> 40:12.192
- You think I'm handsome?

40:13.541 --> 40:15.804
- Everyone, could I have
your attention please?

40:17.545 --> 40:20.679
Thank you so much for a
fantastic
first week of rehearsals.

40:25.379 --> 40:27.512
Our wonderful investor, Philippa
Jones,

40:27.686 --> 40:29.296
would like us all to
join her for cocktails

40:29.470 --> 40:32.212
tonight at the penthouse at
eight.

40:32.386 --> 40:33.343
I expect you all there on time,

40:33.518 --> 40:35.911
in cocktail attire please.

40:36.085 --> 40:37.435
And let's impress Philippa,

40:37.609 --> 40:38.914
and show her we are
professionals,

40:39.088 --> 40:41.221
committed to this film, thanks.

40:42.527 --> 40:44.224
Will, can I see you for a moment
please?

40:52.319 --> 40:54.364
- So this dinner tonight?

40:54.539 --> 40:56.105
- Yeah, it sounds fun.

40:56.279 --> 40:57.411
I can't wait to meet Philippa.

40:57.585 --> 40:59.805
- It needs to go really well.

40:59.979 --> 41:01.154
- I'm sure it will.

41:01.328 --> 41:03.199
- No Kate, really well.

41:04.592 --> 41:06.072
Philippa's been concerned
from the beginning

41:06.246 --> 41:08.248
about us hiring an American,

41:08.422 --> 41:11.033
and you're still
struggling with the accent.

41:11.207 --> 41:14.080
- I didn't realize she
didn't want to cast me.

41:14.254 --> 41:16.735
- Kate, I really really believe
in you,

41:16.909 --> 41:19.041
but we need to make Philippa
believe in you, too.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.307
Okay, let's settle down
everyone,

41:24.482 --> 41:26.179
and let's pick up from the next
scene.

41:26.353 --> 41:27.136
Julia?

41:36.276 --> 41:37.190
And action.

41:38.496 --> 41:39.801
- I just cannot believe it.

41:41.629 --> 41:43.196
- It's what Mister Wickham
said, word for word.

41:43.370 --> 41:44.632
- Maybe he's mistaken.

41:44.806 --> 41:46.373
After all, Mister Bingley trusts
him.

41:46.547 --> 41:48.027
- He seemed very sure of it.

41:50.333 --> 41:51.726
- Something's not right here.

41:53.685 --> 41:57.123
We should reserve judgment
until we have more information.

41:57.297 --> 41:58.341
- Jane, I do envy your ability

41:58.516 --> 42:00.343
to believe the best in people,

42:00.518 --> 42:01.301
even Mister Darcy.

42:03.651 --> 42:06.306
[soft piano music]

42:09.396 --> 42:11.441
- You better hurry up and get
ready.

42:11.616 --> 42:13.792
You might not make it across
town in time.

42:13.966 --> 42:15.010
- Across town?

42:15.184 --> 42:16.055
The party's in the penthouse.

42:16.229 --> 42:17.796
- Oh you didn't hear.

42:17.970 --> 42:20.581
Yes, no, they changed the
location to Locomotive.

42:20.755 --> 42:22.061
Brad's actually driving me

42:22.235 --> 42:23.410
and a few others there, right
now.

42:23.584 --> 42:25.020
- Can I get a ride with you?

42:25.194 --> 42:27.240
- Sorry, car's full.

42:27.414 --> 42:29.111
But you know I could send Brad
back over

42:29.285 --> 42:31.636
to pick you up afterwards,
it just might be too late.

42:31.810 --> 42:33.725
- No no, it's fine, I'll get
ready quickly

42:33.899 --> 42:35.248
and grab a ride share.

42:35.422 --> 42:37.032
Thank you for telling me, I had
no idea.

42:37.206 --> 42:37.946
- You're welcome.

42:48.435 --> 42:51.699
- I'm here, right on
time, 7:59, I'm not late.

42:51.873 --> 42:53.701
- What's the name on the
reservation?

42:53.875 --> 42:55.137
- It's not a reservation,

42:55.311 --> 42:56.965
it's a party for P and P
Productions.

42:58.358 --> 42:59.577
- There's no party here, Miss.

43:00.926 --> 43:02.275
- Are you sure?

43:02.449 --> 43:03.798
It's the name of the a movie
company.

43:06.105 --> 43:07.976
- There's no party.

43:08.150 --> 43:09.108
- But Emilia said.

43:13.199 --> 43:14.461
Emilia.

43:14.635 --> 43:15.157
Yeah.

43:16.115 --> 43:17.072
Thank you anyway.

43:20.946 --> 43:23.601
[soft piano music]

43:35.221 --> 43:36.701
- Brad, hey it's Kate.

43:38.137 --> 43:40.139
I have a huge favor to ask you.

43:40.313 --> 43:42.010
- Now, remember what I told you.

43:42.184 --> 43:44.056
- Yes Jackson, I know what
we're doing, all right?

43:44.230 --> 43:45.797
- Good.

43:45.971 --> 43:47.973
- We are just so lucky to have
you grace

43:48.147 --> 43:50.323
our little production with your
presence.

43:50.497 --> 43:52.281
- Well, since your little
production

43:52.455 --> 43:54.544
is being funded with my money,

43:54.719 --> 43:56.895
I thought I should come and
supervise.

43:57.069 --> 43:59.462
- Philippa, I'd like to
introduce you to Will.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.421
He's playing our rakish Mister
Wickham.

44:06.078 --> 44:08.210
- I've heard so much about you,
Philippa.

44:08.384 --> 44:09.472
I hope it's all true.

44:09.647 --> 44:10.648
- Wicked young man,

44:10.822 --> 44:13.172
you'd better believe it is.

44:13.346 --> 44:16.262
- Well, I'll leave you two
to get to know each other.

44:16.436 --> 44:17.785
- So is it William, or Will?

44:17.959 --> 44:19.221
- It's whatever you want it to
be.

44:24.009 --> 44:25.184
- These are delicious.

44:25.358 --> 44:27.099
- Didn't we just eat dinner?

44:27.273 --> 44:29.231
- I eat when I'm stressed, back
off.

44:31.190 --> 44:32.191
- Any news on Kate?

44:34.802 --> 44:35.673
- No, not yet.

44:38.850 --> 44:40.373
- It's past eight.

44:40.547 --> 44:41.940
She was supposed to be here by
now,

44:42.114 --> 44:42.854
to make a good im--,

44:43.811 --> 44:44.638
Ben.

44:46.248 --> 44:48.076
To make a good impression.

44:48.250 --> 44:49.469
She better be here soon.

44:51.036 --> 44:53.081
- I don't like what we're
doing to her, Jackson.

44:54.604 --> 44:57.042
- We're not doing anything to
her, Sophie.

44:57.216 --> 44:59.000
Our responsibility is for the
best,

44:59.174 --> 45:01.394
and most successful film
possible.

45:01.568 --> 45:04.005
And if she can't pull off the
accent then,

45:04.179 --> 45:05.615
we'll just do the necessary.

45:05.790 --> 45:08.096
- Emilia is nowhere near
the actress Kate is.

45:08.270 --> 45:09.097
- Emilia has the accent.

45:12.448 --> 45:13.711
I want those Watch It ticket
sales,

45:13.885 --> 45:14.929
just as much as you do.

45:15.103 --> 45:16.496
- I think you want them more.

45:19.107 --> 45:21.806
[crowd chatting]

45:24.025 --> 45:26.462
- If Philippa's not happy,
she pulls her funding,

45:27.420 --> 45:29.509
and then we have no film at all.

45:34.427 --> 45:36.081
- You are a lifesaver.

45:36.255 --> 45:38.866
There were no available ride
shares.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.781
- I'm sure there's only
a few in this town,

45:40.955 --> 45:41.956
and they're all probably busy

45:42.130 --> 45:43.610
because it's a Friday night.

45:43.784 --> 45:45.220
- Well I'm lucky you answered
your phone.

45:45.394 --> 45:46.961
- So, what happened?

45:47.135 --> 45:48.963
Why are you all the way out
here?

45:49.137 --> 45:50.748
- Someone told me the party
was at that restaurant,

45:50.922 --> 45:52.619
which it clearly wasn't.

45:52.793 --> 45:53.533
- Sabotage?

45:54.839 --> 45:55.535
- Looks like it.

45:56.754 --> 45:57.798
- Was it that Liam guy?

45:59.147 --> 46:01.410
- No, but why would you say
that?

46:01.584 --> 46:04.239
- I don't know, he's just kind
of rude.

46:04.413 --> 46:05.197
- Not surprised.

46:06.198 --> 46:07.590
What did he do?

46:07.765 --> 46:10.419
- He just, he doesn't engage,
you know.

46:10.593 --> 46:12.987
I mean, and I tried to
tell him I was an actor.

46:13.161 --> 46:14.684
- And he didn't give you the
time of day

46:14.859 --> 46:16.338
because you didn't go
to some fancy school,

46:16.512 --> 46:18.036
and do a bunch of classical
plays, right?

46:18.210 --> 46:19.515
- Pretty much.

46:19.689 --> 46:20.734
And what's with those
headphones?

46:20.908 --> 46:21.648
- It's so weird, right?

46:21.822 --> 46:22.344
- Really weird.

46:23.781 --> 46:24.912
- I'm sorry he treated you like
that.

46:25.086 --> 46:25.608
- It's okay.

46:26.740 --> 46:28.916
I'm gonna break through soon,
anyway.

46:29.090 --> 46:29.961
I can feel it.

46:30.135 --> 46:31.310
- I believe it.

46:31.484 --> 46:32.746
It's gonna happen for you, Brad.

46:34.226 --> 46:35.793
- Thanks.

46:35.967 --> 46:37.142
- How far away from the hotel,
are we?

46:37.316 --> 46:40.710
- Should be less than five
minutes.

46:40.885 --> 46:42.060
- Great, I owe you one.

46:42.234 --> 46:43.365
- [Brad] Hey, don't sweat it.

46:47.108 --> 46:49.502
- So what would you say your
career goal is, my dear?

46:49.676 --> 46:51.765
- Well, to be a leading man, for
sure.

46:52.679 --> 46:55.029
- Well, you certainly have the
looks.

46:55.203 --> 46:57.902
- And if I may be so modest, the
talent.

46:58.076 --> 47:00.034
- Well, we all know that's not
important.

47:02.167 --> 47:05.126
So what you need to do is to
know how to play the game.

47:05.300 --> 47:08.782
You know there are many, many
gorgeous young men out there,

47:08.956 --> 47:10.828
who want the lead roles in
films.

47:12.655 --> 47:15.484
- I'm very aware, that
everything has a price,

47:15.658 --> 47:18.357
and this case, I'm very willing
to pay in.

47:19.706 --> 47:22.056
In fact, nothing would make me
happier.

47:22.230 --> 47:24.058
- Philippa, so lovely to meet
you at last.

47:24.232 --> 47:25.059
- You are?

47:25.233 --> 47:26.234
- Emilia.

47:26.408 --> 47:27.627
I play Caroline Bingley.

47:30.064 --> 47:30.848
- Oh yes.

47:34.721 --> 47:37.202
So sorry I didn't
introduce myself earlier.

47:37.376 --> 47:40.640
I just figured you'd like to
meet the lead actress first,

47:40.814 --> 47:43.338
but it looks like she's still
not here.

47:43.512 --> 47:44.731
I guess she's as bad at showing
up on time

47:44.905 --> 47:46.428
as she is at her English accent.

47:47.647 --> 47:48.648
- She's still struggling?

47:50.258 --> 47:51.042
- Oh dear.

47:53.566 --> 47:56.438
[soft piano music]

48:00.442 --> 48:01.443
- Thank you again.

48:23.335 --> 48:24.684
- You're late.

48:24.858 --> 48:26.294
- Emilia told me the location
changed.

48:26.468 --> 48:27.992
- I don't care, just
please, just be charming.

48:30.516 --> 48:33.345
Philippa, let me introduce you
to Kate,

48:33.519 --> 48:37.044
the amazingly talented
young lady playing Lizzy.

48:37.218 --> 48:39.133
- Hi Philippa, it's so
lovely to finally meet you.

48:39.307 --> 48:41.440
Sophie and Jackson have
told me so much about you.

48:46.488 --> 48:47.533
- I was just telling Philippa
here,

48:47.707 --> 48:49.143
about your accent coaching,

48:49.317 --> 48:50.144
and how much in improvements
you've made.

48:52.146 --> 48:52.930
- Let's hear it then.

48:54.279 --> 48:55.497
- I'm sorry, what?

48:55.671 --> 48:58.239
- Your accent, let's hear it.

49:03.723 --> 49:05.159
- I'm sure Philippa's just
kidding.

49:07.248 --> 49:07.901
- I am not.

49:09.424 --> 49:11.339
I am investing my money in a
production

49:11.513 --> 49:16.214
that has hired an American,
untrained, internet star,

49:16.388 --> 49:20.087
to play one of English
literature's most iconic women,

49:20.261 --> 49:21.741
and I have it on good authority

49:21.915 --> 49:24.309
that she is still
struggling with the accent.

49:24.483 --> 49:25.223
So no,

49:26.398 --> 49:27.355
I'm not joking.

49:29.444 --> 49:31.881
I am telling you to show
us your English accent.

49:33.448 --> 49:37.061
- I'm sorry, I don't
appreciate your insults,

49:37.235 --> 49:39.324
and I'm not gonna perform on
command.

49:39.498 --> 49:41.326
If you would like to hear my
accent,

49:41.500 --> 49:43.328
you are more than welcome to
come to one of our rehearsals.

49:44.590 --> 49:46.070
- You won't perform on command.

49:46.244 --> 49:49.464
Just what do you think an
actress is?

49:49.638 --> 49:53.251
I'll tell you what, nothing
more than a trained monkey.

49:54.774 --> 49:56.558
- Well thank you for your
invitation,

49:56.732 --> 49:57.995
but you will have to excuse me.

50:01.085 --> 50:01.868
- I'll be right back.

50:03.565 --> 50:05.785
- My patience is wearing very
thin.

50:13.227 --> 50:14.489
- Kate?

50:14.663 --> 50:15.447
Kate!

50:16.578 --> 50:18.450
What do you think you're playing
at here.

50:18.624 --> 50:20.147
- Jackson, she's horrible.

50:20.321 --> 50:21.975
I'm not gonna stand there
and be abused, I'm sorry.

50:22.149 --> 50:24.195
- She's investing in the film.

50:24.369 --> 50:26.632
Apparently you need a lesson
on following the money.

50:26.806 --> 50:29.461
She can have whatever she wants.

50:29.635 --> 50:30.505
- Not my integrity.

50:32.333 --> 50:33.856
- If you leave now,

50:34.031 --> 50:35.162
you're seriously putting your
job at risk.

50:36.511 --> 50:37.556
- Good night Jackson.

50:42.474 --> 50:43.040
- Lovely dinner.

50:45.607 --> 50:47.044
- Please talk some sense into
her.

50:53.180 --> 50:53.833
- Kate?

50:57.445 --> 50:59.056
- Are you going to berate me, as
well?

50:59.230 --> 51:00.274
- No.

51:00.448 --> 51:02.059
Not at all.

51:02.233 --> 51:03.234
I actually came to compliment
you.

51:03.408 --> 51:05.018
- On what?

51:05.192 --> 51:06.715
- Standing up for yourself.

51:06.889 --> 51:08.848
That was quite impressive.

51:09.022 --> 51:10.632
I don't know that many
people would have been

51:10.806 --> 51:12.069
so courageous with the person
in control of their job.

51:12.243 --> 51:13.374
- Courageous, or just stupid?

51:16.029 --> 51:16.595
Well, thanks.

51:18.684 --> 51:20.860
- Would you like to have
dinner with me, sometime?

51:22.731 --> 51:23.471
- Like a date?

51:23.645 --> 51:24.385
- Yeah.

51:25.604 --> 51:26.561
- You don't like me.

51:26.735 --> 51:27.954
- That's not true.

51:28.128 --> 51:29.695
- It is, you think I'm not
talented

51:29.869 --> 51:31.479
because I didn't go to
some fancy drama school,

51:31.653 --> 51:33.742
and I haven't been in
a million famous plays.

51:33.916 --> 51:35.614
Oh, and I shouldn't be
playing Lizzy Bennet,

51:35.788 --> 51:36.789
because I'm American.

51:36.963 --> 51:38.051
- Well yes, I do think that such

51:38.225 --> 51:40.097
a beloved English character

51:40.271 --> 51:41.489
should be played by an English
woman with a natural accent.

51:41.663 --> 51:42.447
- And?

51:43.839 --> 51:46.103
- It's just easier sometimes
to act with someone

51:46.277 --> 51:48.366
when they've had similar
training.

51:48.540 --> 51:49.845
- So you don't want to
be challenged by someone

51:50.019 --> 51:51.412
who has different experiences
than you?

51:51.586 --> 51:53.110
Okay, got it.

51:53.284 --> 51:56.069
- But, I've become very
impressed with you.

51:58.463 --> 51:59.116
You've worked hard.

52:00.421 --> 52:02.119
And I know the accent
is still an issue but,

52:03.729 --> 52:05.209
I've never seen someone

52:05.383 --> 52:07.080
put so much effort into their
character.

52:07.254 --> 52:08.168
I find it very admirable.

52:12.607 --> 52:15.480
- Did you say something
to Ben about Julia?

52:15.654 --> 52:17.569
He seemed to like her
before you got involved,

52:17.743 --> 52:20.354
and now he just ignores her.

52:20.528 --> 52:24.097
- I thought Julia may have
thought she'd get ahead,

52:24.271 --> 52:25.185
by giving him attention.

52:26.534 --> 52:28.623
So yes, I said something to him
about it.

52:28.797 --> 52:30.582
- Huh, and Will?

52:30.756 --> 52:32.279
- What about him?

52:32.453 --> 52:34.063
- Are you gonna admit you
stole a part from him?

52:34.238 --> 52:36.022
- I've never stolen a
part, I've earned them.

52:36.196 --> 52:37.502
- He said you spread rumors

52:37.676 --> 52:38.720
to the director of The
Metamorphosis

52:38.894 --> 52:40.548
that he would miss rehearsals

52:40.722 --> 52:41.767
and he might leave the
show without notice.

52:41.941 --> 52:43.290
- That's not what happened.

52:43.464 --> 52:45.205
No he got upset after he was
cast,

52:45.379 --> 52:46.815
because he didn't realize
beforehand

52:46.989 --> 52:48.382
that his pretty face would be
covered up

52:48.556 --> 52:50.036
for most of the play in a bug
suit.

52:50.210 --> 52:51.472
He quit on his own, Kate.

52:54.693 --> 52:56.390
- Okay, so you don't enjoy
acting with me,

52:56.564 --> 52:58.392
because you think I don't
know what I'm doing.

52:58.566 --> 52:59.915
You've been nothing but rude to
me,

53:00.089 --> 53:01.003
and now you're taking me to
dinner?

53:01.178 --> 53:02.831
- I'm sorry I asked, okay?

53:03.005 --> 53:05.573
So let's just carry on
disliking each other

53:05.747 --> 53:08.446
for the next six weeks
we have to work together.

53:08.620 --> 53:10.448
- That's exactly what I intend
to do.

53:10.622 --> 53:11.971
- Have a wonderful night, Kate.

53:15.670 --> 53:18.978
[soft acoustic guitar]

53:35.908 --> 53:36.996
- [Liam] Kate, it's Liam.

53:39.607 --> 53:41.740
I'm sorry to call you so late.

53:41.914 --> 53:42.828
I don't know if you're not
answering

53:43.002 --> 53:44.046
because you're made at me

53:44.221 --> 53:45.047
or if you're just asleep but,

53:46.571 --> 53:48.050
I feel like I have to defend
myself

53:48.225 --> 53:50.009
regarding your accusations
involving Will.

53:51.837 --> 53:53.665
I've known him for a long time.

53:53.839 --> 53:56.711
He's always used his
looks to try to get ahead.

53:56.885 --> 53:58.887
He cares more about himself and
his image

53:59.061 --> 54:01.586
than the character, the
production, or the people
involved.

54:04.110 --> 54:06.025
I understand why you'd be angry
with me,

54:07.331 --> 54:09.333
and I promise to leave you alone
but,

54:09.507 --> 54:11.378
please, for your sake,

54:12.771 --> 54:13.380
don't trust him.

54:23.042 --> 54:25.523
- Hi lovelies, I just
wanted to give you guys

54:25.697 --> 54:27.742
a quick update after our
first week of rehearsals.

54:27.916 --> 54:29.962
We've been working really hard,

54:30.136 --> 54:31.224
and actually last night we had a
dinner

54:31.398 --> 54:32.356
with one of our investors.

54:33.792 --> 54:35.446
Turns out she's not thrilled

54:35.620 --> 54:37.709
that I'm playing the role of
Lizzy.

54:37.883 --> 54:39.319
I guess that just means I have
to

54:39.493 --> 54:40.886
really make sure my accent is
perfect

54:41.060 --> 54:42.583
when she comes to rehearsals
next week.

54:44.063 --> 54:46.457
But anyway, I'd better get to it
so,

54:46.631 --> 54:49.808
all right my darlings
remember to follow your dreams

54:49.982 --> 54:51.723
and make them a reality.

54:51.897 --> 54:52.376
Love you all.

- Kate!

56:26.687 --> 56:27.819
- Oh Sarah, how are you?

56:27.993 --> 56:29.690
- I am doing very well.

56:29.864 --> 56:31.170
You know, for such a small town,

56:31.344 --> 56:33.738
they have a wonderful collection
of shops.

56:33.912 --> 56:35.566
- That's great.

56:35.740 --> 56:38.395
- Now Kate, don't mean to butt
in,

56:41.049 --> 56:44.052
but all work and no play
makes for a boring girl.

56:44.226 --> 56:46.577
Now, I know you're
under a lot of pressure,

56:46.751 --> 56:48.796
but I really think you should
pull yourself together.

56:48.970 --> 56:49.710
- Well.

56:49.884 --> 56:50.929
- No excuses.

56:51.103 --> 56:52.670
- I know but I.

56:52.844 --> 56:55.499
- No excuses, you really
need to try a bit harder.

56:56.848 --> 56:59.894
- Sarah, I am, I don't know why
this is so difficult for me.

57:00.068 --> 57:04.203
- Well, okay, but perhaps you'd
like a little help from me.

57:04.377 --> 57:06.597
- Oh, that would be
wonderful, do you mind?

57:06.771 --> 57:08.642
- No, of course not.

57:08.816 --> 57:10.905
What woman doesn't need a
bit of help, now and again?

57:11.079 --> 57:12.472
- Oh, thank you so much.

57:12.646 --> 57:13.995
I could use all the help I could
get.

57:14.169 --> 57:16.607
- Oh darling girl, you're so
lovely.

57:16.781 --> 57:18.435
Any man would be happy to have
you.

57:20.001 --> 57:23.004
- Thank you, that's very
sweet of you to say,

57:23.178 --> 57:24.615
but about your help, do you
mind?

57:24.789 --> 57:26.051
Do you have time now?

57:26.225 --> 57:28.357
- Oh good, you need to come with
me.

57:28.532 --> 57:30.055
- Can we work on it here?

57:30.229 --> 57:31.796
- Well if you want me to find
you a man,

57:31.970 --> 57:33.014
we shouldn't be here.

57:33.188 --> 57:34.625
I mean, we need to go mingle.

57:35.930 --> 57:37.366
- Oh, wait a minute, I
thought you were talking about

57:37.541 --> 57:39.107
helping me with my accent.

57:39.281 --> 57:41.545
- Oh no Kate, I'm talking
about finding you a man.

57:42.763 --> 57:46.375
You're getting older dear,
and you're still single.

57:46.550 --> 57:48.203
- Sarah I--

57:48.377 --> 57:51.250
- Oh, I know, I know,
you're here to act not date,

57:51.424 --> 57:54.427
but you could miss out
on the right opportunity

57:54.601 --> 57:55.820
to meet the right guy.

57:57.648 --> 58:00.912
- Sarah, I appreciate that you
care,

58:01.086 --> 58:04.655
but I really need to focus
on getting this accent down.

58:04.829 --> 58:06.178
- Oh.

58:06.352 --> 58:07.919
- But, I promise to keep an eye
out

58:08.093 --> 58:10.051
for Mister Right if he shows up.

58:10.225 --> 58:13.054
- Oh good, I'm so glad
we had this little chat.

58:13.228 --> 58:14.360
Anyway, I'd better run.

58:15.753 --> 58:17.711
I will see you bright
and early in the morning.

58:19.060 --> 58:20.366
- Bye.

58:20.540 --> 58:21.889
- Toodles.

58:22.063 --> 58:23.891
- Marriage, Lizzy are you quite
serious?

58:24.065 --> 58:25.632
- I would not joke about such a
thing.

58:27.155 --> 58:28.461
- Whatever did you say?

58:28.635 --> 58:30.245
- Jane, he's the most deplorable
man

58:30.419 --> 58:31.638
I've ever met in my life.

58:31.812 --> 58:32.944
What else could I say but no?

58:34.075 --> 58:35.990
- How did he take the rejection?

58:36.164 --> 58:37.514
- His pride was hurt,

58:37.688 --> 58:40.604
I'm sure, knowing his arrogance
but,

58:40.778 --> 58:42.301
more than that, I cannot say.

58:42.475 --> 58:43.781
- What did you give as your
reasons?

58:43.955 --> 58:46.479
- His distaste for my station,

58:46.653 --> 58:48.046
his dislike of our family,

58:48.220 --> 58:49.830
his ill-treatment of Wickham.

58:50.004 --> 58:51.397
- What did he say of Wickham?

58:51.571 --> 58:52.790
Did he deny the allegations?

58:52.964 --> 58:54.618
- He did.

58:54.792 --> 58:57.229
He claims that Wickham
seduced his younger sister,

58:57.403 --> 58:58.796
and planned to elope with her.

58:58.970 --> 59:00.798
Darcy found out and put a stop
to it

59:00.972 --> 59:02.060
by cutting him off entirely.

59:03.888 --> 59:06.717
- Lizzy, do you really think
that's the truth of it?

59:06.891 --> 59:07.413
- I'm not sure.

59:09.067 --> 59:10.111
And now that I've heard both
sides of it,

59:10.285 --> 59:11.373
I don't know who to believe.

59:14.246 --> 59:15.334
- Should we tell father?

59:16.553 --> 59:17.554
I can't imagine he would allow
us

59:17.728 --> 59:19.556
to walk into town with Wickham,

59:19.730 --> 59:21.253
if he knew the allegations,
especially our little sisters.

59:21.427 --> 59:23.821
- No, we do not yet know the
truth.

59:23.995 --> 59:24.517
- Cut.

59:27.825 --> 59:29.478
- Take a look at this.

59:29.653 --> 59:31.306
- I'm doing terrible.

59:31.480 --> 59:33.134
- No no, you're just a little
rusty from your day off.

59:33.308 --> 59:34.353
- I've been working on it.

59:34.527 --> 59:36.616
- This is unacceptable Sophie.

59:36.790 --> 59:38.792
She can't go around talking on
her channel

59:38.966 --> 59:40.446
about the production, and
the person investing in it.

59:40.620 --> 59:42.883
- Have you thought of
asking Liam for help?

59:43.057 --> 59:44.450
- What, why?

59:44.624 --> 59:46.060
- It's unacceptable.

59:46.234 --> 59:46.974
- You need to calm down,
it's not that much--

59:47.148 --> 59:47.975
- I am calm.

59:48.149 --> 59:49.455
This is me, calm.

59:49.629 --> 59:51.239
Do not tell me to calm down.

59:51.413 --> 59:53.633
- You just seem to do really
well when he coaches you.

59:53.807 --> 59:55.809
- I don't know if that's such a
good idea,

59:55.983 --> 59:57.332
it might be kind of awkward.

59:57.506 --> 59:59.247
- Look, I know he's said some
things

59:59.421 --> 01:00:00.988
that were quite mean but.

01:00:01.162 --> 01:00:02.555
- No no, it's not that it's,

01:00:04.035 --> 01:00:05.558
he asked me to dinner and I said
no.

01:00:07.038 --> 01:00:08.692
- When?

01:00:08.866 --> 01:00:11.477
- Um, after the cocktail
party with Philippa.

01:00:16.177 --> 01:00:18.832
- Well things are starting
to make sense now.

01:00:19.006 --> 01:00:20.399
- Like what?

01:00:20.573 --> 01:00:22.575
- I just noticed he's been
watching you

01:00:22.749 --> 01:00:23.663
quite a lot recently.

01:00:24.969 --> 01:00:26.623
- Probably critiquing my acting.

01:00:27.928 --> 01:00:29.103
- No, not that.

01:00:29.277 --> 01:00:30.757
- That's the end of it.

01:00:30.931 --> 01:00:33.064
Kate, can we see you in the
office please?

01:00:33.238 --> 01:00:33.978
- Okay.

01:00:38.286 --> 01:00:40.549
- Awkward or not, it
might be your only option.

01:01:01.658 --> 01:01:03.311
- Take a seat, Kate.

01:01:05.487 --> 01:01:07.054
Philippa has some business

01:01:07.228 --> 01:01:08.839
that is taking her to
New York for the week,

01:01:09.013 --> 01:01:10.754
but she'll be back on Friday
to come to rehearsals.

01:01:10.928 --> 01:01:12.625
- I'll be ready, I promise.

01:01:12.799 --> 01:01:14.627
- Kate, I'm more concerned
about this at the moment.

01:01:14.801 --> 01:01:16.237
- Really hard, and actually last
night

01:01:16.411 --> 01:01:18.109
we had a dinner with one of our
investors.

01:01:19.066 --> 01:01:20.764
Turns out she's not thrilled

01:01:20.938 --> 01:01:22.983
that I'm playing the role of
Lizzy.

01:01:23.157 --> 01:01:24.942
I guess that just means
I have to make sure

01:01:25.116 --> 01:01:26.595
my accent is perfect.

01:01:26.770 --> 01:01:28.249
- I don't understand
why you'd post a video

01:01:28.423 --> 01:01:29.468
disparaging the production,

01:01:29.642 --> 01:01:31.426
and the person investing in it.

01:01:32.558 --> 01:01:34.299
- I didn't mean to.

01:01:34.473 --> 01:01:36.605
I just posted a video
about what I was doing

01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:39.217
with my life, that's what I do.

01:01:40.392 --> 01:01:42.568
- You're lucky Philippa hasn't
seen this.

01:01:42.742 --> 01:01:44.701
You need to take it down.

01:01:44.875 --> 01:01:46.877
And from now on if you post
anything about the production,

01:01:47.051 --> 01:01:48.487
or anybody involved in it,

01:01:48.661 --> 01:01:50.576
it must be done so in a positive
light.

01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:51.969
- So you want me to lie?

01:01:52.143 --> 01:01:55.276
- No, we don't want you to lie.

01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:57.278
- Kate look, you have to
understand.

01:01:57.452 --> 01:01:59.890
Your channel is a marketing
tool for this film,

01:02:00.064 --> 01:02:02.675
and by speaking ill of it, you
put its success in jeopardy.

01:02:06.026 --> 01:02:07.767
- Spencer needs to see you for a
fitting

01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:09.551
before this afternoon's
rehearsal.

01:02:10.988 --> 01:02:11.553
- Okay.

01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:22.477
- It's a very nice color
on you, don't you think?

01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:24.436
- Yes, you've done quite the
job.

01:02:25.698 --> 01:02:27.700
- Oh Kate, honey, your dress
is in the back of the screen.

01:02:27.874 --> 01:02:29.397
Go in and change so I can check
the fit.

01:02:29.571 --> 01:02:30.355
- [Kate] Sure.

01:02:31.443 --> 01:02:32.574
- Stop fidgeting.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.054
Why do you seem so anxious?

01:02:34.228 --> 01:02:35.752
I am not gonna stick you with
pins.

01:02:35.926 --> 01:02:36.578
- Sorry.

01:02:42.193 --> 01:02:42.759
- Oh Kate.

01:02:44.238 --> 01:02:48.460
Not to compliment my own
work, but you look beautiful.

01:02:48.634 --> 01:02:49.766
Come over here in the mirror.

01:02:52.507 --> 01:02:54.335
Almost a perfect fit on the
bodice,

01:02:54.509 --> 01:02:57.512
just a few more places to be
adjusted,

01:02:57.686 --> 01:03:00.428
but you look absolutely
gorgeous.

01:03:00.602 --> 01:03:02.779
Liam, doesn't she look gorgeous?

01:03:05.825 --> 01:03:07.261
- Yep.

01:03:07.435 --> 01:03:08.610
- Well then, tell her that,
silly man.

01:03:10.656 --> 01:03:11.613
- You look beautiful.

01:03:12.614 --> 01:03:13.746
- Thanks.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:15.443
- My goodness Liam,

01:03:15.617 --> 01:03:17.010
I hope you'll be more
convincing on screen.

01:03:17.184 --> 01:03:18.490
- Can I get out of this, now,
please?

01:03:18.664 --> 01:03:20.318
- No, just wait right where you
are,

01:03:20.492 --> 01:03:22.450
let go get my phone and
take a picture for Sophie.

01:03:30.415 --> 01:03:32.547
- You do look very pretty.

01:03:32.721 --> 01:03:33.505
- Thank you.

01:03:35.159 --> 01:03:36.900
You look really nice, as well.

01:03:37.074 --> 01:03:37.639
- Really?

01:03:42.993 --> 01:03:44.559
- I may need to ask you a favor.

01:03:44.733 --> 01:03:45.647
But feel free to say no.

01:03:48.041 --> 01:03:50.348
Mister Collins, will you
please pass me the water?

01:03:50.522 --> 01:03:51.392
- [Liam] Water.

01:03:51.566 --> 01:03:53.046
- Water.

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:54.091
- Water.

01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:55.744
- Water.

01:03:55.919 --> 01:03:58.835
- No, softer, make a www
sound with your lips.

01:04:02.969 --> 01:04:06.799
No, I think you just
need to relax a little.

01:04:06.973 --> 01:04:07.756
- I know what will help with
that,

01:04:07.931 --> 01:04:09.497
and it's not water.

01:04:09.671 --> 01:04:10.455
- Water.

01:04:21.727 --> 01:04:23.642
You bought this used, I assume?

01:04:25.252 --> 01:04:27.646
Looks like it's been read about
100 times.

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:29.561
- [Kate] Probably mostly by me.

01:04:29.735 --> 01:04:30.867
I got it for my 13th birthday.

01:04:32.172 --> 01:04:32.738
- Wow.

01:04:34.087 --> 01:04:35.567
You're quite the Austenite.

01:04:35.741 --> 01:04:36.698
- Of course.

01:04:37.917 --> 01:04:39.397
Aren't you?

01:04:39.571 --> 01:04:40.354
- No.

01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:44.184
- Are you serious?

01:04:44.358 --> 01:04:45.446
You're playing Mister Darcy,
and you don't love Jane Austen?

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:48.710
- Well, I don't love her,

01:04:49.798 --> 01:04:51.322
she's fine, it's just,

01:04:52.584 --> 01:04:54.455
romance stories for women.

01:04:54.629 --> 01:04:57.067
- It's not just romance stories.

01:04:57.241 --> 01:04:59.112
She understood human
nature and relationships

01:04:59.286 --> 01:05:01.898
better than anyone else I've
ever read.

01:05:02.072 --> 01:05:04.988
- Well that is quite the
endorsement.

01:05:05.162 --> 01:05:06.815
I guess I'll have to
give her a try some day.

01:05:08.121 --> 01:05:09.557
- You've never even read her?

01:05:11.298 --> 01:05:12.821
Oh, now I need this more than
anything.

01:05:14.867 --> 01:05:16.738
- I just never got around to it,
I guess.

01:05:17.957 --> 01:05:18.740
To Miss Austen.

01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:27.053
- Thank you for doing this.

01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:28.446
You really didn't have to.

01:05:29.447 --> 01:05:30.230
- My pleasure.

01:05:31.971 --> 01:05:33.059
- If I don't get this right,

01:05:33.233 --> 01:05:33.755
I think they're gonna fire me.

01:05:35.148 --> 01:05:35.757
- I don't think so.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.848
The accent may be a struggle
but,

01:05:40.023 --> 01:05:41.328
your acting's really good.

01:05:41.502 --> 01:05:42.329
- Really?

01:05:42.503 --> 01:05:43.983
- Really.

01:05:44.157 --> 01:05:45.767
- Well, you've just seen me in
rehearsal,

01:05:45.942 --> 01:05:48.553
we'll see how it ends up on
screen.

01:05:48.727 --> 01:05:51.382
- Well if your Watch It
videos are anything to go by,

01:05:52.774 --> 01:05:53.950
you'll probably be pretty great.

01:05:57.388 --> 01:05:58.780
Yep.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:01.783
Okay I've watched your channel.

01:06:04.003 --> 01:06:06.788
I was very dismissive about
it in the beginning but,

01:06:06.963 --> 01:06:07.746
I was wrong.

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:09.791
- Wow.

01:06:10.967 --> 01:06:12.707
Thank you.

01:06:12.881 --> 01:06:15.362
- You know their not
actually going to fire you.

01:06:16.755 --> 01:06:17.582
They need you.

01:06:20.237 --> 01:06:22.326
I don't want to hurt your
feelings but,

01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:26.721
they are counting on your
subscribers for the box office.

01:06:28.810 --> 01:06:29.637
- I know.

01:06:31.248 --> 01:06:33.076
It's the main reason they hired
me.

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:34.947
- You knew?

01:06:35.121 --> 01:06:38.820
- Of course, but, I really
appreciate you telling me.

01:06:40.387 --> 01:06:43.608
- I didn't want you to worry
about it.

01:06:43.782 --> 01:06:45.958
But, we should get back to it.

01:06:47.133 --> 01:06:48.961
- Water.

01:06:49.135 --> 01:06:50.397
- That said, let's try something
easier,

01:06:50.571 --> 01:06:51.572
like wine.

01:06:51.746 --> 01:06:52.443
- Wine.

01:06:52.617 --> 01:06:54.140
- Perfect.

01:06:54.314 --> 01:06:54.967
- See, that sounds the
same in both accents.

01:06:55.141 --> 01:06:55.837
- See, easier.

01:07:00.277 --> 01:07:02.279
- Hi lovelies, I know it's a
little late,

01:07:02.453 --> 01:07:05.064
but I wanted to give you a quick
update.

01:07:05.238 --> 01:07:08.067
Everything is going great.

01:07:08.241 --> 01:07:10.678
Everything has really
turned around this week.

01:07:12.071 --> 01:07:14.987
The cast is friendlier,
my accent is improving,

01:07:15.161 --> 01:07:17.424
and I really feel like
it's all gonna work out.

01:07:20.427 --> 01:07:21.472
Yeah, I can't do this.

01:07:23.256 --> 01:07:23.865
I can't lie.

01:07:26.477 --> 01:07:29.219
When I made this channel,
I promised to be authentic,

01:07:29.393 --> 01:07:31.525
and not sugarcoat how
hard this was gonna be,

01:07:33.614 --> 01:07:37.009
and to be honest everything
is really a mess right now.

01:07:39.490 --> 01:07:43.146
I made the producer angry
by posting my videos.

01:07:43.320 --> 01:07:46.888
That investor is not happy with
me.

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:49.108
The girl who plays Caroline
hates me,

01:07:49.282 --> 01:07:51.893
and I'm still working on my
accent.

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:56.985
But the one good thing is my
accent is actually improving.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:59.684
The guy playing Darcy,
Liam, he's helping me.

01:08:03.035 --> 01:08:04.689
I'm probably gonna get in
trouble

01:08:04.863 --> 01:08:07.909
for posting this video
but I have to be truthful.

01:08:09.172 --> 01:08:10.912
Please remember to follow your
dreams,

01:08:11.087 --> 01:08:12.523
and always be true to yourself.

01:08:15.308 --> 01:08:16.657
And I'll try to remember that,
too.

01:08:17.441 --> 01:08:19.269
I've never been happier
than at this moment,

01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:20.139
my darling husband.

01:08:21.444 --> 01:08:23.403
- I'm very pleased to hear so.

01:08:23.577 --> 01:08:24.143
A lovely wife.

01:08:25.362 --> 01:08:27.059
- And tell me, are you happy?

01:08:29.408 --> 01:08:30.193
- Let's see,

01:08:32.064 --> 01:08:34.893
I married a woman whose beauty
is matched

01:08:35.067 --> 01:08:37.678
by a lively mind, and a
courageous spirit.

01:08:39.854 --> 01:08:41.813
No man has ever been happier.

01:08:43.380 --> 01:08:44.946
- Well, I've seen enough for
today.

01:08:46.992 --> 01:08:48.036
- Let's go to the office
Philippa,

01:08:48.211 --> 01:08:49.212
I'll make you a cup of tea.

01:08:51.475 --> 01:08:52.953
- I guess we're done for the
day.

01:08:54.346 --> 01:08:55.218
Go have an early night.

01:09:01.876 --> 01:09:04.618
- You did an amazing job, today.

01:09:04.792 --> 01:09:05.662
- Really?

01:09:05.837 --> 01:09:06.925
The accent was okay?

01:09:07.099 --> 01:09:08.187
- Oh, it was perfect actually.

01:09:09.406 --> 01:09:09.970
You were perfect.

01:09:12.191 --> 01:09:13.975
- I really appreciate you
spending

01:09:14.149 --> 01:09:16.326
all your free time with me this
week.

01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:17.979
I wanted to make you feel
like it was worth it.

01:09:20.372 --> 01:09:22.158
- I've never seen someone work
harder to achieve something.

01:09:23.376 --> 01:09:24.072
I'm very impressed.

01:09:25.291 --> 01:09:27.424
- Thank you, that means a lot.

01:09:27.598 --> 01:09:28.120
- Also I,

01:09:30.252 --> 01:09:31.036
I wanted to say that,

01:09:32.733 --> 01:09:36.215
I'm really sorry about
what I said that night.

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:38.086
I mean I shouldn't have--

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:39.000
- It's okay.

01:09:41.046 --> 01:09:42.265
We'll pretend it didn't happen.

01:09:44.310 --> 01:09:45.006
Friends?

01:09:46.834 --> 01:09:47.357
- Friends.

01:09:51.491 --> 01:09:55.016
Would you like to grab something
to eat?

01:09:55.191 --> 01:09:56.757
As friends?

01:09:58.585 --> 01:10:00.239
- Thanks, but I was actually
gonna run by wardrobe

01:10:00.413 --> 01:10:03.111
and see how my dress is coming
along,

01:10:03.286 --> 01:10:04.504
now that, I'm convinced I'll
actually

01:10:04.678 --> 01:10:05.810
get a chance to wear it.

01:10:07.464 --> 01:10:09.640
- Next time then.

01:10:09.814 --> 01:10:11.424
I'll see you at rehearsal.

01:10:11.598 --> 01:10:12.860
- Yeah, I'll see you then.

01:10:24.655 --> 01:10:27.005
- I'm gonna have to start all
over,

01:10:27.179 --> 01:10:29.268
you have very different
proportions than Kate.

01:10:29.442 --> 01:10:30.530
- What is going on?

01:10:30.704 --> 01:10:33.185
- Kate, honey, I'm so sorry.

01:10:33.359 --> 01:10:34.621
They just told me today

01:10:34.795 --> 01:10:37.058
I had to fit Emilia for your
costume.

01:10:37.233 --> 01:10:38.886
- I can't believe this.

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:42.194
- There's more to acting
than just fixing your accent.

01:10:42.368 --> 01:10:43.413
Looks like Philippa finally
realized

01:10:43.587 --> 01:10:45.110
you just lack the talent.

01:10:45.284 --> 01:10:47.678
- Sweetheart it's okay,
you'll get another role.

01:10:47.852 --> 01:10:50.071
- Yes, maybe they'll recast you.

01:10:51.203 --> 01:10:52.726
Although considering the accent
problem,

01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:55.294
it'll probably have to
be a background role.

01:10:55.468 --> 01:10:56.077
- Excuse me.

01:10:59.167 --> 01:11:01.039
- So how about some numbers,
Jackson?

01:11:01.213 --> 01:11:02.562
- We're looking at another 20
thousand

01:11:02.736 --> 01:11:04.216
for the other location,

01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:06.784
plus we have to get local hire
extras.

01:11:06.958 --> 01:11:08.568
Kate?

01:11:08.742 --> 01:11:10.353
- Why are you recasting
me, I got the accent.

01:11:10.527 --> 01:11:12.790
- Jackson, take care of this.

01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:15.923
- I warned you about the videos,
Kate.

01:11:16.097 --> 01:11:19.013
- But you said if I
performed to your standards,

01:11:19.187 --> 01:11:20.232
I wouldn't get fired.

01:11:21.494 --> 01:11:24.149
- Yes, but we would if you
jeopardized

01:11:24.323 --> 01:11:25.759
the production's reputation.

01:11:25.933 --> 01:11:28.109
- And those videos of
yours most certainly do.

01:11:29.110 --> 01:11:30.590
- I was just being honest.

01:11:30.764 --> 01:11:32.113
- And it's going to cost you.

01:11:36.901 --> 01:11:38.032
- I'm very sorry, Kate.

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:50.001
[Kate sobbing]

01:11:50.175 --> 01:11:52.308
- Oh Kate, what's wrong?

01:11:52.482 --> 01:11:54.048
- They're gonna recast me with
Emilia.

01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:57.269
- But you got the accent.

01:11:57.443 --> 01:12:00.011
- I know, that's what I said,
but Philippa

01:12:00.185 --> 01:12:01.186
doesn't like my Watch It videos,

01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:02.143
because I won't lie.

01:12:04.885 --> 01:12:05.799
- I'm so sorry.

01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:08.324
I wish there was something I
could do.

01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.326
- It's okay.

01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:13.241
I know we didn't get
off on the right foot,

01:12:13.416 --> 01:12:16.157
but I'm glad I got to know you,

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:18.508
and thank you for all your help.

01:12:18.682 --> 01:12:19.335
- That was my fault.

01:12:21.119 --> 01:12:21.946
The bad start.

01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:24.427
- You made up for it.

01:12:37.353 --> 01:12:38.179
- Jackson?

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:40.181
Sophie?

01:12:43.271 --> 01:12:44.490
Philippa, I need to talk, oh.

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.754
Excuse me, I should have
knocked.

01:12:47.928 --> 01:12:50.104
- It's fine, I was just
on my way out actually.

01:12:50.278 --> 01:12:51.715
- See you tonight for a drink?

01:12:51.889 --> 01:12:52.759
- I wish I could but
I have lines to learn.

01:12:52.933 --> 01:12:53.412
Maybe tomorrow.

01:13:01.377 --> 01:13:02.465
- You should thank your
lawyer for negotiating

01:13:02.639 --> 01:13:05.163
such an ironclad contract.

01:13:05.337 --> 01:13:07.557
Lizzy wasn't the only
role I wanted to recast.

01:13:11.256 --> 01:13:12.475
- I have a proposition for you.

01:13:15.303 --> 01:13:18.655
- Hi loves, well I got the
accent,

01:13:18.829 --> 01:13:22.093
and I'm so proud of myself.

01:13:22.267 --> 01:13:24.487
But the investor got upset

01:13:24.661 --> 01:13:26.402
with some of the videos I've
posted,

01:13:26.576 --> 01:13:29.230
and it looks like I'm gonna
be replaced as Lizzy Bennet.

01:13:31.581 --> 01:13:34.584
It was fun while it lasted.

01:13:34.758 --> 01:13:38.501
Even though it was hard, it's
the most fun I've ever had.

01:13:42.461 --> 01:13:43.897
I'm not giving up.

01:13:44.071 --> 01:13:45.116
I'll get another role.

01:13:55.605 --> 01:13:56.344
Hi, Sophie?

01:14:00.523 --> 01:14:01.262
I don't understand.

01:14:04.135 --> 01:14:05.702
- Congratulations everyone.

01:14:05.876 --> 01:14:07.355
We've made it to the
last day of rehearsals.

01:14:07.530 --> 01:14:09.270
Give yourselves a big round of
applause.

01:14:14.275 --> 01:14:15.842
Just one small change to the
cast

01:14:16.016 --> 01:14:18.541
before we start shooting next
week.

01:14:18.715 --> 01:14:21.282
Mister Darcy will now be played
by Will,

01:14:23.546 --> 01:14:26.636
and Liam will now be taking
over the role of Wickham.

01:14:29.073 --> 01:14:31.379
Let's take five, and we'll
begin today's rehearsals.

01:14:37.647 --> 01:14:40.258
- Can you believe it,
we're completely shocked.

01:14:40.432 --> 01:14:41.955
- I don't know what's happening,

01:14:42.129 --> 01:14:43.435
I thought they were gonna
replace me with Emilia.

01:14:43.609 --> 01:14:45.437
- Looks like she thought so,
too.

01:14:45.611 --> 01:14:47.831
- And you want her with
her fake British accent,

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:50.877
to be bringing us and
our entire lives down.

01:14:51.051 --> 01:14:55.099
- Right, yes, coffee, cream,
no sugar, and three biscuits.

01:14:56.622 --> 01:14:58.058
Sorry Kate, cookies.

01:15:07.024 --> 01:15:08.155
- When did this happen?

01:15:09.374 --> 01:15:10.549
- He texted me a couple of days
ago.

01:15:11.855 --> 01:15:13.552
I didn't want to say anything,

01:15:13.726 --> 01:15:16.076
because I was worried he
would lose interest, again.

01:15:17.469 --> 01:15:18.949
- Did he explain why he ignored
you?

01:15:19.123 --> 01:15:20.864
- He apologized.

01:15:21.038 --> 01:15:23.301
He said he wasn't sure I liked
him.

01:15:23.475 --> 01:15:26.086
But apparently Liam talked to
him.

01:15:27.653 --> 01:15:30.090
He said it was probably because
I'm shy,

01:15:30.264 --> 01:15:32.092
and he should try again.

01:15:32.266 --> 01:15:33.572
- Really?

01:15:33.746 --> 01:15:34.355
Liam?

01:15:35.356 --> 01:15:36.314
- Liam.

01:15:36.488 --> 01:15:38.055
- Okay guys, and action.

01:15:39.404 --> 01:15:40.231
- Once again.

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:47.064
Darcy.

01:15:48.195 --> 01:15:50.502
- Mister Bingley's proposal to
Jane.

01:15:50.676 --> 01:15:52.373
May I assume you are
responsible?

01:15:54.462 --> 01:15:55.594
- That was all for you.

01:15:56.726 --> 01:15:59.990
My feelings for you
have remained unchanged.

01:16:00.164 --> 01:16:03.428
One word from you and they
shall be silenced for good.

01:16:03.602 --> 01:16:04.342
- Your Aunt?

01:16:04.516 --> 01:16:05.256
- She was here.

01:16:06.953 --> 01:16:08.302
- She asked me to promise

01:16:08.476 --> 01:16:09.652
never to enter an engagement
with you.

01:16:10.827 --> 01:16:12.393
- Yes, I know,

01:16:13.699 --> 01:16:17.094
and your refusal to do
so has given me hope.

01:16:17.268 --> 01:16:18.661
Yeah, I hope.

01:16:20.010 --> 01:16:23.404
- Mister Darcy I am now and
fairly yours.

01:16:23.579 --> 01:16:24.405
- And cut.

01:16:25.929 --> 01:16:27.670
It's getting late guys,

01:16:27.844 --> 01:16:29.497
I'm sorry to do this but,

01:16:29.672 --> 01:16:31.456
if we're gonna be ready by
Monday,

01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:33.414
we're gonna have to work
through the weekend.

01:16:38.768 --> 01:16:39.986
- Do you like it?

01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:41.771
- The accent sounded good.

01:16:41.945 --> 01:16:43.599
- Really?

01:16:43.773 --> 01:16:44.774
I am hoping Liam will
still help me even though--

01:16:44.948 --> 01:16:46.253
- He probably will.

01:16:46.427 --> 01:16:47.603
He really respects your work
ethic.

01:16:48.952 --> 01:16:49.866
- I'll ask him.

01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.346
- And Kate, I'm sorry.

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:54.653
I didn't want to recast you and,

01:16:54.827 --> 01:16:56.568
I'm really happy you're still
our Lizzy.

01:16:56.742 --> 01:16:59.266
- It's okay, I understand.

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:00.398
I know you were in a tough spot

01:17:00.572 --> 01:17:02.356
with Philippa and Jackson.

01:17:02.530 --> 01:17:03.836
- That's very generous of you,

01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:05.621
but I should have been more
honest.

01:17:05.795 --> 01:17:07.361
- I appreciate that.

01:17:07.535 --> 01:17:09.363
And I'm looking forward
to starting filming.

01:17:13.759 --> 01:17:15.065
- Everything okay?

01:17:15.239 --> 01:17:16.849
- Fine.

01:17:17.023 --> 01:17:18.938
He says he's tired after
a long day of rehearsals.

01:17:19.112 --> 01:17:20.374
I'll check on him in a bit.

01:17:29.775 --> 01:17:31.124
- I hope you thanked Liam
properly,

01:17:31.298 --> 01:17:32.648
for what he did for you.

01:17:32.822 --> 01:17:34.562
- What did he do?

01:17:34.737 --> 01:17:36.390
- Are you stupid?

01:17:36.564 --> 01:17:38.436
He's the one that made
the deal with Philippa.

01:17:38.610 --> 01:17:39.872
He gave up his role to Will,

01:17:40.046 --> 01:17:41.700
if she let you keep your role as
Lizzy.

01:17:41.874 --> 01:17:42.875
- I had no idea.

01:17:43.049 --> 01:17:44.094
- You've got him wrapped around

01:17:44.268 --> 01:17:45.269
your little finger don't you?

01:17:45.443 --> 01:17:46.400
- It's not like that.

01:17:47.488 --> 01:17:49.186
- Well, don't get used to it.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:50.361
I will be Lizzy.

01:17:57.150 --> 01:17:59.762
[knocking on door]

01:18:06.072 --> 01:18:07.247
- Hi.

01:18:07.421 --> 01:18:08.814
- Hi.

01:18:08.988 --> 01:18:09.510
Can I come in?

01:18:15.386 --> 01:18:16.866
I'm sorry about what happened.

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:19.607
- Hmm, that's just business for
you.

01:18:20.826 --> 01:18:22.567
You never know what's
going on behind the scenes.

01:18:24.351 --> 01:18:25.962
I just feel bad for you.

01:18:26.136 --> 01:18:27.485
- Why?

01:18:27.659 --> 01:18:28.921
- You get to play opposite Will.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.710
- Liam, I know you sacrificed
your role

01:18:34.884 --> 01:18:36.320
so I could play Lizzy.

01:18:36.494 --> 01:18:36.973
- Who told you?

01:18:38.017 --> 01:18:39.758
Emilia?

01:18:39.932 --> 01:18:40.672
- How'd she find out?

01:18:42.892 --> 01:18:44.589
- She's been cozying up to Will
lately,

01:18:44.763 --> 01:18:46.678
and I guess he told her,

01:18:46.852 --> 01:18:49.855
and then she confronted me
about it after the announcement.

01:18:50.029 --> 01:18:51.552
- I can't believe you
would do that for me.

01:18:53.337 --> 01:18:54.773
But I'm sorry I can't accept it.

01:18:56.427 --> 01:18:57.602
I'm gonna step down as Lizzy.

01:18:58.908 --> 01:19:00.779
- No, Kate this is your chance,

01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:03.434
to become a professional,

01:19:03.608 --> 01:19:04.696
with the role of your dreams.

01:19:06.350 --> 01:19:08.613
And you worked so hard, please.

01:19:10.136 --> 01:19:11.007
Let me do this for you.

01:19:14.227 --> 01:19:15.533
- It's too generous.

01:19:17.317 --> 01:19:19.015
No, this is your chance

01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:20.973
to make your big break in
American films.

01:19:23.193 --> 01:19:24.585
I can't let you do that for me.

01:19:25.848 --> 01:19:28.024
[screaming]

01:19:28.198 --> 01:19:28.938
What was that?

01:19:32.115 --> 01:19:34.073
- William you--

01:19:34.247 --> 01:19:37.598
[confused yelling]

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.035
- We were just rehearsing.

01:19:39.209 --> 01:19:40.166
- And what scene do Caroline and
Darcy

01:19:40.340 --> 01:19:41.428
share in their pajamas?

01:19:41.602 --> 01:19:42.908
- Please, I am so sorry.

01:19:43.082 --> 01:19:44.736
I promise, Will told me that you
two--

01:19:44.910 --> 01:19:46.869
- What sort of idiot do you take
me for,

01:19:47.043 --> 01:19:47.957
you silly little girl?

01:19:49.088 --> 01:19:50.698
- You're both fired.

01:19:50.873 --> 01:19:52.135
- Oh Philippa, come on,
it was just a mistake.

01:19:52.309 --> 01:19:53.789
- Jackson get the production
assistant

01:19:53.963 --> 01:19:56.008
fitted for Wickham's uniform.

01:19:56.182 --> 01:19:57.705
And find me an actor who
can pull off an accent

01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:59.446
to play Caroline.

01:19:59.620 --> 01:20:02.972
[Emilia whimpering]

01:20:03.146 --> 01:20:04.930
- You, you're back on as Darcy.

01:20:05.104 --> 01:20:06.627
- Only if Kate still plays
Lizzy.

01:20:07.715 --> 01:20:09.282
- Fine.

01:20:09.456 --> 01:20:10.806
- Really, even though
I posted those videos?

01:20:10.980 --> 01:20:12.416
- Well your champion here
convinced me

01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:13.809
that a little bit of
controversy would be good

01:20:13.983 --> 01:20:14.766
for ticket sales.

01:20:15.985 --> 01:20:16.812
Jackson.

01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:26.169
- Hi loves, well it's
the last day of filming

01:20:26.343 --> 01:20:27.866
Pride and Prejudice.

01:20:28.040 --> 01:20:29.433
In a few minutes, we're
actually gonna shoot

01:20:29.607 --> 01:20:31.391
our last scene for the day.

01:20:31.565 --> 01:20:32.653
I can't believe we made it.

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:34.264
- [Brad] Kate, Kate.

01:20:34.438 --> 01:20:35.961
- Hey Brad, yeah get in here,
come here.

01:20:36.135 --> 01:20:37.354
You guys remember Brad,
our Mister Wickham.

01:20:37.528 --> 01:20:38.964
- I hope all of you lovely
ladies

01:20:39.138 --> 01:20:40.661
will go to the cinema to see
this film.

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.969
- And here is Ben and Julia.

01:20:44.143 --> 01:20:46.145
Still together, how long has it
been?

01:20:46.319 --> 01:20:48.408
- About six weeks.

01:20:48.582 --> 01:20:49.845
- Two months for me.

01:20:50.019 --> 01:20:52.021
I fell for her, the moment I saw
her.

01:20:52.195 --> 01:20:55.589
- And they are as disgustingly
cute in real life,

01:20:55.763 --> 01:20:58.114
as their onscreen counterparts.

01:20:58.288 --> 01:21:00.899
Here's Liam, still wearing his
headphones.

01:21:02.248 --> 01:21:03.815
He finally told me why he wears
them.

01:21:03.989 --> 01:21:05.077
It helps him block everything
out

01:21:05.251 --> 01:21:06.949
and focus on his character.

01:21:07.123 --> 01:21:08.689
Oh, yeah of course.

01:21:08.864 --> 01:21:10.778
- Hi subscribers, I hope
you remember seeing me.

01:21:10.953 --> 01:21:11.954
I play Missus Bennet.

01:21:12.128 --> 01:21:13.477
- Oh I'm sure they remember you.

01:21:13.651 --> 01:21:14.695
- You know, I've been thinking
Kate,

01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:16.697
now that Brad is a real actor,

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:18.482
perhaps you should make a play
for him.

01:21:18.656 --> 01:21:20.440
- And on that note, we're
gonna end the episode, yeah.

01:21:20.614 --> 01:21:22.834
- Kate, Liam, over here.

01:21:23.008 --> 01:21:24.749
- Okay, now I really do need to
go.

01:21:25.881 --> 01:21:27.795
I am so sad this is coming to an
end,

01:21:27.970 --> 01:21:30.102
but I'm so excited to see
how it's all gonna turn out.

01:21:30.276 --> 01:21:31.712
Well, wish me luck,

01:21:31.887 --> 01:21:33.932
and remember, keep following
your dreams.

01:21:44.116 --> 01:21:45.509
Let me thank you,

01:21:46.423 --> 01:21:47.728
in the name of all my family,

01:21:49.078 --> 01:21:51.645
for the generous compassion
which induced you

01:21:51.819 --> 01:21:53.647
to take so much trouble,

01:21:53.821 --> 01:21:54.953
and bear so many mortifications

01:21:55.127 --> 01:21:56.520
for the sake of finding them.

01:21:58.565 --> 01:21:59.653
- If you will thank me,

01:21:59.827 --> 01:22:02.787
let it be for yourself alone.

01:22:02.961 --> 01:22:05.007
the wish of giving happiness
to you might add force

01:22:05.181 --> 01:22:07.400
to the other inducements that
led me on,

01:22:07.574 --> 01:22:08.924
that I shall not attempt to
deny.

01:22:10.534 --> 01:22:11.752
Your family owes me nothing.

01:22:14.016 --> 01:22:16.148
Much as I respect them, I
believe I thought only of you.

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:21.458
You're too generous to trifle
with me.

01:22:23.199 --> 01:22:24.852
If your feelings are still
what they were last April,

01:22:25.027 --> 01:22:25.766
tell me so at once.

01:22:28.117 --> 01:22:30.075
My affections and wishes
are unchanged but,

01:22:31.511 --> 01:22:34.079
one word from you will silence
me on this subject forever.

01:22:45.308 --> 01:22:46.787
- My feelings have changed.

01:22:48.920 --> 01:22:50.704
- No, I must confess that I
admire

01:22:51.662 --> 01:22:53.794
and love you most ardently.

01:22:59.670 --> 01:23:00.236
- Cut.

01:23:03.891 --> 01:23:07.112
[upbeat orchestral music]

01:23:13.727 --> 01:23:17.727
Keep rolling.
