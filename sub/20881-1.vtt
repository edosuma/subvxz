00:41.707 --> 00:43.207
Yeah, keep going.

00:48.781 --> 00:51.983
It's like three houses down,
and it's the...

00:51.985 --> 00:54.318
Yeah, blue house
on the right, there.

00:54.320 --> 00:56.421
- This one, here?
- Yeah. Yeah.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.992
Hey, it's only 15 bucks, man,
don't worry about it.

01:00.994 --> 01:03.661
We got to go back to the bus,
man, I gotta get my wallet.

01:03.663 --> 01:05.997
Can you just take me back to
the bus station? I can't...

01:05.999 --> 01:07.565
no, no, I can't do that.
I can't...

01:07.567 --> 01:11.602
I can't take you all the way back there,
dude. Just don't worry about the 15 bucks.

01:11.604 --> 01:16.908
I can't go, I got other fares, I
can't go all the way back there.

01:32.858 --> 01:34.892
<i>I understand that.
It's just...</i>

01:34.894 --> 01:38.863
There's no way that I can tell you
exactly what seat I was sitting in.

01:38.865 --> 01:41.165
Do you understand? It was
probably like seven back.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.867
Seven from the...
It was like the middle.

01:42.869 --> 01:44.235
It's like the middle of the bus!

01:44.237 --> 01:46.537
I don't even...
I, I don't know.

01:47.806 --> 01:49.607
Peter Latang.

01:49.609 --> 01:53.611
L-a-t-a-n-g.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.614
How often do these kind of
things turn up? 'Cause I...

01:56.616 --> 01:58.449
I just want to get... okay.

02:04.223 --> 02:06.624
- Hi, Kristin.
- Hi, Peter, how are you?

02:06.626 --> 02:07.892
Come on in.
Sorry about the walk.

02:07.894 --> 02:09.092
Oh, it's okay.

02:09.095 --> 02:10.661
Sorry about this shit hole,
this place is...

02:10.663 --> 02:12.230
- this is not a shit hole.
- Well.

02:12.232 --> 02:13.898
Believe me, I've seen
plenty of those.

02:13.900 --> 02:15.733
Can I get something for you,
some coffee...

02:15.735 --> 02:17.702
no, I'm fine. You know,
I got to run, so.

02:17.704 --> 02:19.270
My phone's already on
the photo app.

02:19.272 --> 02:21.906
So I'm just going to go through and
take some photos if that's okay.

02:21.908 --> 02:23.307
- Yeah, that's great.
- Okay, great!

02:23.309 --> 02:24.976
- That's great.
- Are these hardwoods,

02:24.978 --> 02:26.878
are they all through the house?

02:26.880 --> 02:28.212
Yeah, I think...

02:28.214 --> 02:29.780
that's great! You know,
that's gonna really...

02:29.782 --> 02:31.883
That would definitely up it.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.018
And if you want
you can do an estate sale.

02:34.020 --> 02:36.354
Oh, that must be a lot more work for you.
You don't need that.

02:36.356 --> 02:40.525
I really don't mind, you know. It usually
helps with the cost of the cleaning.

02:40.527 --> 02:44.061
Oh, you're in this shot so,
just, uh, look handsome.

02:44.763 --> 02:46.564
Nice!

02:46.566 --> 02:48.866
Uh, yeah, honestly,

02:48.868 --> 02:50.601
the sooner we get this done,
the better.

02:50.603 --> 02:53.137
I'd really like to be kinda
over with it, you know, like...

02:53.139 --> 02:54.605
- Yeah, definitely.
- Yeah.

02:54.607 --> 02:56.507
Um, all right, well,

02:56.509 --> 02:59.810
how long are you in town for?

02:59.812 --> 03:01.445
Just the night. I'm going back
tomorrow morning.

03:01.447 --> 03:02.680
Oh, bummer!

03:02.682 --> 03:04.215
If you could just sign here?

03:04.217 --> 03:05.217
Okay.

03:05.884 --> 03:07.952
And... yeah.

03:09.621 --> 03:11.355
Yeah, that's great.

03:11.357 --> 03:13.691
All right, well, thank you. And I will
call you if I have any questions.

03:13.693 --> 03:14.725
How about that?

03:14.727 --> 03:16.394
Yeah! Okay,
do you have my number?

03:16.396 --> 03:17.728
Uh...

03:17.730 --> 03:19.730
I have whatever number
you called me with.

03:19.732 --> 03:22.133
Oh, yeah. Okay, all right.

03:22.135 --> 03:24.368
Well, thank you so much, Peter.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.804
Well, Kristin, thank you.
It was really...

03:26.806 --> 03:28.539
A pleasure to meet you.

03:30.008 --> 03:31.576
You don't remember me, do you?

03:32.444 --> 03:33.244
Nah...

03:33.246 --> 03:35.346
I'm tan Megan's youngest sister!

03:35.348 --> 03:37.148
Ah, all right.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.249
Mm-mm.

03:38.251 --> 03:39.517
- Yeah.
- Okay!

03:39.519 --> 03:41.886
I thought you'd remember me,
but you just totally didn't!

03:41.888 --> 03:43.588
- No.
- Okay.

03:43.590 --> 03:44.922
I'm super gay.

03:44.924 --> 03:47.391
I'm just gonna...
I'm just gonna go, and, uh...

03:47.393 --> 03:49.360
Yeah, ah, ah,
ah, ah, I'll just...

03:49.362 --> 03:51.495
I'll just see you
later then, hopefully.

03:51.497 --> 03:52.830
Okay. All right. Kristin...

03:52.832 --> 03:54.131
- Yeah, you skipped one there.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:54.133 --> 03:56.634
All right, all right, uh...
All right.

03:56.636 --> 03:57.602
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

03:57.604 --> 03:58.903
- Bye.
- Great to see you. Bye.

03:58.905 --> 04:00.438
Bye, Kristin.

04:31.703 --> 04:33.304
No.

04:37.476 --> 04:39.877
Fuck!

04:39.879 --> 04:42.280
<i>Hey, listen, Kenny. I really don't
want to waste your time, man.</i>

04:42.282 --> 04:44.048
I just... I'm in a real pinch.

04:44.050 --> 04:46.617
I lost my wallet
right when I got here.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.019
And I'm kind of fucked!

04:48.021 --> 04:51.155
And I was wondering if you
could possibly, uh, wire up

04:51.157 --> 04:54.191
a couple, you know, like, you
know, 100 bucks or something?

04:57.663 --> 04:59.096
<i>Are you serious?</i>

04:59.599 --> 05:04.368
<i>Oh, I hate to see you like super
polite to me for a second, bro.</i>

05:04.370 --> 05:06.804
<i>I'm don't know why.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</i>

05:06.806 --> 05:08.306
That's okay.

05:11.377 --> 05:15.046
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. What is it?
What is it? What's up?</i>

05:15.048 --> 05:17.081
Uh... would that be possible?

05:17.582 --> 05:19.850
<i>Um... uh...</i>

05:19.852 --> 05:21.619
<i>Uh...</i>

05:21.621 --> 05:24.288
<i>No, today's not a good day.
I don't think so.</i>

05:24.290 --> 05:26.791
<i>Here's the thing, man, I got
a bunch of stuff happening.</i>

05:26.793 --> 05:28.159
Oh, god.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.127
I don't need you to do it
right now, I mean, really,

05:30.129 --> 05:31.896
if you could come later,
it'd be fine.

05:31.898 --> 05:33.564
I mean, I'm really,
really kinda stuck.

05:33.566 --> 05:36.667
<i>Listen, like I said,
it's just not a good day.</i>

05:36.669 --> 05:40.371
<i>Like, any other day, man, I'd be
there for you in, like, a second.</i>

05:40.373 --> 05:43.541
<i>Bro, like, you know,
you don't have any friends</i>

05:43.543 --> 05:45.710
<i>or family there that
can help you out?</i>

05:45.712 --> 05:49.046
No, no, no, no, no.
There's not.

05:49.048 --> 05:53.484
<i>Yeah, I wish I could, man, but like
I said, it's just not a good day.</i>

06:03.795 --> 06:06.731
Okay.

06:42.667 --> 06:43.768
Donald?

06:46.438 --> 06:47.838
Can I help you?

06:49.808 --> 06:51.208
It's Latang.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.414
Pete?

06:58.383 --> 06:59.683
Are you serious?

07:00.685 --> 07:01.852
How you doing?

07:02.954 --> 07:04.555
Oh, my god.

07:08.493 --> 07:09.660
No!

07:09.662 --> 07:11.061
No, it's not you!

07:11.063 --> 07:12.730
It's not you.

07:12.732 --> 07:14.432
Oh, my god!

07:14.434 --> 07:15.566
Yes!

07:15.568 --> 07:16.534
Yes!

07:16.536 --> 07:17.768
Oh, my god.

07:18.737 --> 07:20.137
Oh!

07:23.241 --> 07:26.210
- How are you doing?
- What are you here for?

07:27.746 --> 07:28.879
Oh!

07:29.581 --> 07:31.515
Oh, my god.

07:32.784 --> 07:34.585
Are you moving back here?

07:34.587 --> 07:36.620
Tell me you're moving
back here, please.

07:36.622 --> 07:37.521
I'm not.

07:37.523 --> 07:39.056
- You're not?
- No, I'm...

07:39.058 --> 07:40.791
I'm here for Nona's.

07:40.793 --> 07:43.661
I'm just taking care of the affairs
and the house and everything.

07:43.663 --> 07:45.629
Yeah.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.799
I wasn't sure if you'd
be back for that or not.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.568
I know, I know.

07:50.570 --> 07:53.737
My family and everybody,
we're so sorry.

07:53.739 --> 07:55.706
- That's very sweet...
- and you know in these times

07:55.708 --> 07:59.009
how important it is,
the grieving process,

07:59.011 --> 08:00.611
to have friends
and family around.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.881
We would be here for you,
whatever you need.

08:04.617 --> 08:07.985
- Yeah, okay, I appreciate that.
- All right?

08:07.987 --> 08:09.487
- All right.
- Thank you.

08:10.188 --> 08:12.923
I mean, what are we gonna do?

08:12.925 --> 08:14.558
That's the question

08:14.560 --> 08:17.962
we need to start asking ourselves
right now, what are we gonna do?

08:17.964 --> 08:19.797
- What are we doing?
- Yeah.

08:27.339 --> 08:30.574
I am...
I'm just still like...

08:30.576 --> 08:34.845
Having such a hard time processing
this reality right now.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.679
This is such a hard reality.

08:36.682 --> 08:38.249
Do you feel like that
at all? Yeah?

08:38.251 --> 08:40.618
Yeah, me too.
I'm kind of sensing it, yeah.

08:40.620 --> 08:43.187
I was like, "who is this old guy

08:43.188 --> 08:45.756
at my fucking doorstep.
Who is this old guy?"

08:45.758 --> 08:48.659
And you said your name and I
was just like, "oh, my god!"

08:48.661 --> 08:50.928
I would have never have
recognized you, I mean,

08:50.930 --> 08:52.396
you just look
so much different now.

08:52.398 --> 08:56.233
- Mm. - Your skin just looks
tired and worn, and I just...

08:56.235 --> 08:58.869
I just thought, like, when you left
you became, like, a bounty hunter

08:58.871 --> 09:01.438
- or something like that. So
when you came back... - Oh?

09:01.440 --> 09:05.776
Home, it would just be you
on this fucking motorcycle,

09:05.778 --> 09:09.246
cruising down the street
on a big hog with just...

09:09.248 --> 09:13.651
And everybody, the whole neighborhood's
just coming out and you're fucking like,

09:13.653 --> 09:15.619
hair is just flowing,

09:15.621 --> 09:19.456
your muscles are all fucking jacked
up, you have weapons and everything.

09:19.458 --> 09:24.962
Like, the craziest fucking muscles
anyone has ever fucking seen.

09:24.964 --> 09:29.833
Just like the most oily, veiny,
strong... just muscles.

09:29.835 --> 09:32.436
And your hair, like...
You obviously cut it, but,

09:32.438 --> 09:34.872
imagine what your hair would look like.
You'd actually...

09:34.874 --> 09:36.407
I just kept...

09:36.409 --> 09:40.311
Yeah, I mean, seeing you now, you'd
look, if your hair was long still,

09:40.313 --> 09:41.845
you'd kinda look like...

09:41.847 --> 09:44.815
I don't know, like a
Jewish witch or something.

09:44.817 --> 09:47.117
But I had pictured you
never cutting your hair.

09:47.119 --> 09:51.155
And it just being like this long
hair that almost told a story

09:51.157 --> 09:52.623
about where you've been.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.893
Like, whoever you killed,
whatever bounties you collected,

09:55.895 --> 09:57.995
you'd take a keepsake from them.

09:57.997 --> 09:59.763
And, like, weave it
into your hair.

09:59.765 --> 10:03.300
And, like, each kill you did
you would take a keepsake.

10:03.302 --> 10:07.071
If you killed a father with like a
family, you'd take the baby's...

10:07.073 --> 10:10.174
Like, something from the baby's
and weave it into your hair.

10:10.176 --> 10:12.843
So your hair would
actually tell the story.

10:12.845 --> 10:16.413
That's kind of how
I had pictured you coming back.

10:16.415 --> 10:18.916
I get this must be pretty
disappointing then, I guess.

10:21.953 --> 10:23.387
No, I mean...

10:23.389 --> 10:26.390
I don't think so. I mean,
I think you look cool too.

10:26.392 --> 10:28.993
You kinda have more like...
Kinda like... a hit man.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.528
Yeah. Yeah!

10:31.530 --> 10:34.398
Well, I mean, it's incredible
for me to be back here.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.767
Sit down. Just take a seat.

10:36.769 --> 10:38.035
Sit down.

10:44.275 --> 10:46.276
Did you see...

10:46.278 --> 10:48.946
Have you seen the,
uh, wonderful...

10:48.948 --> 10:51.115
Mrs. Lisa Marie rose?

10:51.117 --> 10:52.449
No.

10:52.451 --> 10:54.118
Do you know her at all?
Do you know any of her work?

10:54.120 --> 10:57.054
No, I don't... I don't think I
do, it's hard to... hard to...

10:57.056 --> 10:58.989
- Get a read.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.891
I met her at a convention.

11:00.893 --> 11:01.959
Uh-huh, yeah, I see.

11:01.961 --> 11:05.262
She was like a really
fucking cool chick.

11:05.264 --> 11:06.597
Like, you would have dug her.

11:06.599 --> 11:08.232
- Like, I know your type.
- Uh-huh.

11:08.234 --> 11:09.833
- I definitely know your type.
- Yeah.

11:09.835 --> 11:11.735
And you would have
fucking been all over that.

11:11.737 --> 11:14.338
Because not only does she have
the curves and the body,

11:14.340 --> 11:15.506
but she's got the mind.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.574
- And that's what I know...
- That's me.

11:17.576 --> 11:19.076
That's what I know you get into.

11:19.078 --> 11:22.112
I like it! I mean, I think
it's cool that she's a thinker

11:22.114 --> 11:24.214
as well as a doer, but,

11:24.216 --> 11:27.785
I was really impressed
with how she...

11:27.787 --> 11:30.988
Conducted herself, and just
her philosophies and everything.

11:30.990 --> 11:33.957
She seemed like she could
be doing other things.

11:33.959 --> 11:38.062
I mean, not that I want her to be
doing anything else but that, but...

11:38.064 --> 11:39.463
Do you masturbate still, or...

11:39.465 --> 11:42.232
- I actually wanted to ask you...
- if you do,

11:42.234 --> 11:44.835
she's somebody you're gonna
want to look up her stuff.

11:44.837 --> 11:45.936
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:45.938 --> 11:47.104
- Yeah.
- It's really good.

11:47.106 --> 11:48.972
Okay. Well, maybe I will.

11:48.974 --> 11:51.942
Listen, I wanted to ask you, I've got
all this stuff going on over at Nona's.

11:51.944 --> 11:55.012
And I have to get over
to the funeral home, um...

11:55.014 --> 11:58.282
I got to pick up, you know,
these ashes. Would you mind

11:58.284 --> 11:59.650
giving me a ride?
That would be...

11:59.652 --> 12:01.151
- No, of course not.
- Really?

12:01.153 --> 12:03.520
Yeah, I need to switch gears
right now.

12:03.522 --> 12:06.156
I would be honored
to do that for you.

12:06.158 --> 12:07.391
Okay. Thank you very much.

12:07.393 --> 12:09.460
- I mean, of course.
- That's a big help.

12:09.462 --> 12:10.794
- Of course.
- Okay.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.463
I will feel honored.

12:17.635 --> 12:20.104
You look...
I'm just so...

12:20.106 --> 12:21.305
- Yeah, you're excited.
- Yeah!

12:21.307 --> 12:23.407
- And I am too.
- Yeah!

12:23.409 --> 12:25.843
I feel this is like...
What!

12:29.247 --> 12:31.582
Do you do social media at all?

12:32.450 --> 12:34.151
- Not really.
- No?

12:34.153 --> 12:38.155
Because I found a guy, uh,
Pete Latang, from Wyoming.

12:38.157 --> 12:39.590
Okay.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.458
And I thought it was you,
so I was following for a while,

12:41.460 --> 12:43.494
and he had like
a family and stuff.

12:43.496 --> 12:46.230
You know, I kept
private messaging him,

12:46.232 --> 12:52.402
and eventually he told me to, you know,
fuck off, 'cause it wasn't who... you know,

12:52.404 --> 12:54.605
I wasn't who he thought it was.

12:54.607 --> 12:59.376
But I thought maybe it was still you,
and you just didn't wanna talk to me.

12:59.378 --> 13:00.844
Oh, really?

13:00.846 --> 13:02.813
- Yeah, was it you?
- Uh, yeah, no.

13:02.815 --> 13:04.414
- That wasn't you?
- It wasn't me.

13:04.416 --> 13:05.916
No, I didn't think it was.

13:05.918 --> 13:07.684
- 'Cause I've never been to Wyoming...
- I dint think so.

13:07.686 --> 13:09.853
Just for a little while I was
like, "hey, this is kinda cool."

13:09.855 --> 13:12.422
I'm watching Pete,
and his two boys,

13:12.424 --> 13:14.024
and his family and everything.

13:14.026 --> 13:15.259
Watching the family, yeah.

13:15.261 --> 13:17.895
Yeah, yeah. And you guys had
summers at a lake, I don't know

13:17.897 --> 13:20.364
if it was in Wyoming,
wherever it was,

13:20.366 --> 13:24.668
but you were, really, from what
I could gather, a good dad.

13:26.437 --> 13:28.806
Yeah, you were
good to those kids.

13:42.287 --> 13:44.621
So, you wanna...

13:44.623 --> 13:47.391
Do you want me to wait
in the car? Or actually...

13:47.393 --> 13:48.559
I'd like to come in actually.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.527
Oh, yeah, no, no.
That's really sweet.

13:50.529 --> 13:53.230
I kind of got to take my time
there with her.

13:53.232 --> 13:54.331
All right.

13:54.333 --> 13:55.766
But, I really...
I want to thank you, man.

13:55.768 --> 13:58.635
This is like... You really
got me out of a pinch. So,

13:58.637 --> 14:02.840
I think I'm probably just going to head in.
I got a bunch of stuff, I got to get going.

14:02.842 --> 14:05.075
Would you mind if I actually
borrow a couple bucks?

14:05.077 --> 14:07.711
That's the one thing 'cause
I'm just in this, like, spot.

14:07.713 --> 14:10.514
And then, I'll probably just
get my errands done, and then

14:10.516 --> 14:12.115
- we could hook up and do...
- I thought...

14:12.117 --> 14:13.016
whatever. I'd be in to...

14:13.018 --> 14:14.885
- Yeah, like maybe...
- I just thought

14:14.887 --> 14:17.321
we were going to,
like, hang out.

14:17.323 --> 14:21.325
Like, I thought, like, we'd go
see some places, see some faces,

14:21.327 --> 14:23.026
just kinda like cruise a bit.

14:23.028 --> 14:25.662
Yeah, and I'd love to do that.
I just can't do it now, so,

14:25.664 --> 14:28.532
that's why I'm saying, maybe,
like, later, we could...

14:29.367 --> 14:31.101
Okay.

14:31.103 --> 14:34.004
All right. It's fine. I just thought
when you came over to my house...

14:34.006 --> 14:35.072
It was to hang out.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.207
I didn't realize you were
just coming over because

14:37.209 --> 14:39.576
you needed a ride or you needed
to borrow money.

14:39.578 --> 14:40.811
That's not...

14:40.813 --> 14:42.779
- which is fine.
- No, no. That's not what I was...

14:42.781 --> 14:45.983
you know I help whoever
needs help, so that's fine.

14:45.985 --> 14:49.119
But I just thought it's because
you wanted to hang out with me.

14:54.058 --> 14:56.193
Right! Yeah! I mean, um...

14:58.763 --> 15:00.564
All right. Well, let's do that.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.033
Let me go get this
and then, um...

15:03.035 --> 15:06.169
It just makes the more sense for
us to just kinda keep hanging.

15:08.940 --> 15:09.940
Right.

15:14.112 --> 15:15.145
Pete.

15:15.147 --> 15:16.246
- Hey.
- What?

15:16.248 --> 15:17.581
I can't do this.

15:18.549 --> 15:20.050
- What do you mean?
- I can't do this.

15:20.052 --> 15:23.520
- What? - I can't stay in
this car by myself right now.

15:23.522 --> 15:24.855
Donald, I'm gonna be
like five minutes, man.

15:24.857 --> 15:27.024
This is so tough for me too.

15:27.026 --> 15:29.927
For me, and to have some
closure to this whole thing,

15:29.929 --> 15:36.233
I feel like I'd be going crazy
sitting in there by myself.

15:36.235 --> 15:37.567
I feel like I need this for me.

15:37.569 --> 15:38.535
You want to come in?

15:38.537 --> 15:40.003
I, uh... please.

15:41.306 --> 15:43.140
I just know myself.

15:43.142 --> 15:47.077
And bad things would happen if I
was left in that Van by myself.

15:59.090 --> 16:01.458
Oh, you know what
I just thought of?

16:01.460 --> 16:02.659
Do you remember, uh, when...

16:02.661 --> 16:04.594
Donnie, you have to be quiet
in here, please.

16:04.596 --> 16:06.063
All I'm asking...

16:06.065 --> 16:08.832
Yeah, but can you just
tell me in the car, please?

16:08.834 --> 16:10.767
No, I just want
to tell you right now.

16:10.769 --> 16:13.337
- Go, sit back down.
- No, listen, just quickly.

16:13.339 --> 16:16.239
Do you remember when I wanted
to pull a prank on you,

16:16.241 --> 16:19.076
and I snuck into Nona's room
when she was out?

16:19.078 --> 16:21.244
And I went through
her underwear drawer,

16:21.246 --> 16:24.348
and I remember her door opened
up and I thought it was you,

16:24.350 --> 16:26.683
but it was actually, uh, Nona.

16:26.685 --> 16:30.220
And she fucking freaked out
on me, you remember that?

16:30.889 --> 16:35.058
That was crazy. Do you think
she saw anything or...

16:35.060 --> 16:37.494
Because I remember just being,
like really embarrassed.

16:37.496 --> 16:40.697
And I didn't want to go back to
your house, for like two weeks.

16:40.699 --> 16:44.167
'Cause I never knew. Did she ever
mention anything about seeing my penis,

16:44.169 --> 16:45.435
or anything like that?

16:45.437 --> 16:47.504
No, she didn't. She didn't
mention it to me, so...

16:47.506 --> 16:49.239
I mean...

16:49.241 --> 16:52.275
I had never heard Nona swear,
and I, I...

16:52.277 --> 16:54.444
She might have that day, and...

16:54.446 --> 16:57.581
You know, if I'm going to
be honest I wouldn't blame her.

16:57.583 --> 17:00.217
She was livid,
and she should be.

17:00.219 --> 17:02.419
'Cause I shouldn't have
been doing that.

17:03.521 --> 17:04.921
Oh.

17:07.959 --> 17:11.127
- Just here.
- So I checked off here.

17:11.130 --> 17:12.929
- Yup. Just sign right here.
- Okay.

17:12.931 --> 17:14.531
And then, uh, initial here.

17:14.532 --> 17:15.464
Okay.

17:15.467 --> 17:16.400
That'd be great.

17:16.402 --> 17:17.768
- Great.
- Okay.

17:18.935 --> 17:21.505
Here's the urn, and...

17:23.308 --> 17:24.907
Here's a...

17:25.510 --> 17:26.542
Complimentary bag.

17:26.545 --> 17:27.711
Ooh, nice!

17:27.713 --> 17:30.013
- Thank you very much.
- We'll take that.

17:33.051 --> 17:35.719
Lately I've been really into...

17:35.721 --> 17:37.154
Just building, like...

17:37.156 --> 17:39.222
Just Di, d-i-i...

17:39.224 --> 17:41.358
D-y-i stuff.

17:41.360 --> 17:43.093
You ever do any of that, Dyi?

17:43.095 --> 17:43.860
No.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.796
What do you do in Manhattan?

17:46.798 --> 17:47.864
- Pete?
- What?

17:47.866 --> 17:49.633
What do you do there?

17:49.635 --> 17:51.168
I'm in finance.

17:51.769 --> 17:53.070
What is that?

17:53.471 --> 17:54.638
Banking.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.440
- Oh, shit! Really?
- I'm in a bank, yeah.

17:56.442 --> 17:59.709
- So you deal with like, fucking
serious cash and shit? - Sometimes.

17:59.711 --> 18:01.311
Oh, nice, man, nice.

18:01.313 --> 18:04.748
Do you have access to, like, the
vaults and everything like that?

18:05.383 --> 18:06.416
Some of them.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.752
Whoa, fuck, we should, uh...

18:08.754 --> 18:12.122
We should talk about
fucking planning something.

18:12.124 --> 18:14.191
- Like what?
- Like a fucking job.

18:15.426 --> 18:17.027
We'll fucking rob it.

18:18.763 --> 18:20.163
- Yeah, no.
- So we gotta make sure

18:20.165 --> 18:22.566
we get there real fucking early
before the sun rises.

18:22.568 --> 18:24.868
And we'll fucking both
kick down the fucking door,

18:24.870 --> 18:26.670
together we'll both
fucking boot it in.

18:26.672 --> 18:29.706
You fucking hop on top of the
counter, fucking threaten everybody,

18:29.708 --> 18:33.243
"you better get the fuck down, or I'm
gonna start spraying this place!"

18:33.245 --> 18:35.212
You run to the back because
you have all the codes,

18:35.214 --> 18:37.247
all the access codes.
I'll stay out front.

18:37.249 --> 18:39.749
Just listen for a second.
I'll stay out front.

18:39.751 --> 18:41.618
Crowd control. You fucking
throw me the cash,

18:41.620 --> 18:45.222
I'll grab it. We're gonna need something
really, really fast parked outside.

18:45.224 --> 18:47.891
I back out of the place like
this, making sure no one moves,

18:47.893 --> 18:50.093
'cause we don't want
anyone to see our identity.

18:50.095 --> 18:52.162
You're outside
peeling the car around,

18:52.164 --> 18:53.930
you know how to get
around New York, right?

18:53.932 --> 18:57.033
So you know all the access,
exit routes and stuff?

18:57.035 --> 18:58.869
- Yeah.
- We'll be out of there.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.204
We will never have to worry
about a thing again.

19:03.541 --> 19:05.909
That would be fucking cool.

19:05.911 --> 19:07.377
- Right?
- Yeah.

19:07.379 --> 19:08.945
- Yeah.
- It'll be great.

19:18.623 --> 19:20.090
Are you seeing anybody?

19:21.826 --> 19:25.128
No. I want nothing to do
with a female right now.

19:25.130 --> 19:27.130
You remember Betsy Williams?

19:27.465 --> 19:28.398
Yeah. Wow!

19:28.400 --> 19:30.333
You remember her?
Real psycho.

19:30.335 --> 19:32.435
Yeah, she's insane.
She jerked me off in the dugout.

19:32.437 --> 19:35.539
- And you were on the lookout.
- I was the lookout.

19:35.541 --> 19:38.742
But anyway, she jerked
me off, and we fucked.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.577
And I got her pregnant.

19:41.480 --> 19:45.081
Yeah. And at that time I felt
like it was the right move.

19:45.083 --> 19:48.985
Like, I felt like it was good for me to maybe
start a family and move forward, that way.

19:48.987 --> 19:51.688
- Okay.
- So I quit my job,

19:51.690 --> 19:54.090
and stayed home,
and raised the child.

19:54.092 --> 19:56.326
But while I was doing that
she was out still partying.

19:56.328 --> 19:58.328
She wasn't ready for
that next step, so,

19:58.330 --> 20:02.098
she was out partying and I ended up
finding her fucking somebody else,

20:02.100 --> 20:04.167
who ends up being the real dad.

20:04.169 --> 20:08.638
And his father had a Biotech
company in Orlando,

20:08.640 --> 20:12.175
and they moved down there
and I haven't seen them since.

20:16.047 --> 20:18.915
Right now it's about
the next chapter in my life.

20:18.917 --> 20:21.017
Right now it's a new chapter.

20:21.019 --> 20:23.220
Starring me,
and what my future is.

20:23.222 --> 20:26.356
So, I just am ready to move on
there, so I wouldn't even sweat it.

20:26.358 --> 20:28.792
Do you know
that's definitely not your kid?

20:28.794 --> 20:30.493
Did you get it tested?
Like a DNA test?

20:30.495 --> 20:32.195
She told me.

20:32.197 --> 20:34.331
You didn't want to get tested
to find out? That might be...

20:34.333 --> 20:36.666
to be honest,
I'm not ready for it.

20:36.668 --> 20:37.901
So...

20:37.903 --> 20:39.202
It's fine.

20:40.271 --> 20:41.705
I guess.

20:41.707 --> 20:43.940
It kinda seems like
a big deal to me.

20:43.942 --> 20:46.076
Hey, look who it is.

20:47.745 --> 20:49.613
Look who it is.

20:51.716 --> 20:54.084
- Oh, Jesus.
- You wanna say something?

20:54.086 --> 20:55.919
I actually would really love...
No, no, no.

20:55.921 --> 20:59.389
- They don't want to see us.
- No, let's not, let's not. Hey, hey, hey.

20:59.391 --> 21:00.523
Let's... Donald, please.

21:00.525 --> 21:02.158
Brenda?

21:02.160 --> 21:03.393
Brenda?

21:03.395 --> 21:04.361
- Hey.
- Hi!

21:04.363 --> 21:06.162
- How's it going?
- Good, good. How are you?

21:06.164 --> 21:07.897
- It's Donald.
- Yeah, yeah, I remember you.

21:07.899 --> 21:10.033
Yeah, look who came
into town to visit me.

21:10.035 --> 21:11.801
- Hi.
- It's Pete Latang.

21:11.803 --> 21:13.903
Oh, wow! You look so different.
How are you?

21:13.905 --> 21:15.405
- I'm good. How are you doing?
- I'm good.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.107
Who's this?
Your husband?

21:17.109 --> 21:19.276
- Yeah, this is Shawn.
- Donald.

21:19.278 --> 21:20.310
- Hi.
- Shawn?

21:20.312 --> 21:22.212
- That's a cool name, bro. I like that.
- Thanks.

21:22.214 --> 21:24.047
That's fucking cool, dude.

21:24.049 --> 21:26.349
You look really good,
by the way.

21:26.351 --> 21:28.585
- Thank you.
- Yeah, you look really...

21:28.587 --> 21:30.320
She was like one of the...

21:30.855 --> 21:31.888
One of the hot chicks.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.556
I went to high school
with these guys.

21:33.558 --> 21:36.159
Guys were kind
of the metal heads.

21:36.161 --> 21:39.229
Yes, we were, yes, we were.

21:39.231 --> 21:41.531
I just wanted to say that, like,
you look really good,

21:41.533 --> 21:44.401
'cause I know that women can get
self-conscious after they have kids and stuff,

21:44.403 --> 21:47.003
and I just wanted to say that
you look good.

21:47.005 --> 21:48.171
Thank you. Thank you.

21:48.173 --> 21:49.673
- Donald.
- Good to see you guys.

21:49.675 --> 21:51.107
We'll make a move?

21:51.109 --> 21:52.809
- What's that?
- You wanna make a move?

21:52.811 --> 21:54.644
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's do that.

21:55.479 --> 21:57.280
Well, I'm almost done.

21:59.483 --> 22:03.420
Do you think that once we took
off I could probably get that...

22:03.422 --> 22:05.889
you know, he asked you
to homecoming, right?

22:05.891 --> 22:08.658
- You remember when he asked
you to homecoming? - Donald...

22:08.660 --> 22:10.160
Um...

22:10.928 --> 22:11.961
- No.
- No?

22:11.963 --> 22:14.664
He asked, like, you, Tina rose,

22:15.566 --> 22:17.200
- Melanie Gwirk.
- Oh, boy.

22:17.202 --> 22:19.402
He asked, like,
all of the hottest girls.

22:19.404 --> 22:22.138
- You did, but I completely understand why.
- Sorry.

22:22.140 --> 22:27.377
I was like, "what, are you out of your mind?
None of these girls are going to like you."

22:27.379 --> 22:30.547
And you know what we did? He wanted
to go on this revenge tour...

22:30.549 --> 22:32.082
- Hey, hey...
- Don't kick me.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.484
- We wanted to go on this revenge tour.
- Donald.

22:34.486 --> 22:38.788
Me and him both did poop and
we both did a poop in bags...

22:38.790 --> 22:42.192
that we did not do. We did a lot
of things, that we did not do!

22:42.194 --> 22:44.160
Now, we should probably
get going. Let's make a move.

22:44.162 --> 22:45.762
- We did do that.
- No, we didn't.

22:45.764 --> 22:47.430
- Yes, we did.
- No, we didn't.

22:47.432 --> 22:50.400
Yes, we did. We did do that. He's
embarrassed now but we did that.

22:50.402 --> 22:52.369
We did. Swear to god we didn't.

22:54.004 --> 22:55.839
- Swear to god?
- I swear to god we didn't.

22:55.841 --> 22:56.773
- Okay.
- Yeah.

22:56.775 --> 22:58.241
- Swear to god!
- Enough!

23:07.084 --> 23:08.818
We did do it, bro.

23:16.494 --> 23:17.827
Hi!

23:17.829 --> 23:19.929
I'll get this bill.

23:19.931 --> 23:21.998
I'll take care of it.
Hey, baby.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.533
Great to see you guys.

23:23.968 --> 23:25.568
You too.

23:26.036 --> 23:27.470
Baby.

23:38.649 --> 23:39.649
Hey.

23:40.951 --> 23:43.153
Are you fucking mad about that?

23:43.155 --> 23:44.888
'Cause you fucking
stormed out of there.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.055
No, I'm not mad.

23:46.057 --> 23:47.657
- It seemed like you were mad.
- I'm not.

23:48.025 --> 23:49.025
You sure?

23:49.027 --> 23:50.026
Yeah.

23:50.028 --> 23:51.494
They fucking...

23:51.496 --> 23:54.397
When you left, like, right
a second after you left,

23:54.399 --> 23:57.534
everyone at the table,
we were all fucking, just...

23:57.536 --> 23:58.802
Cracking up!

23:58.804 --> 24:00.437
- Yeah, yeah, laughing?
- Yeah.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.605
I mean, no, slinging shit all over
someone's house, it's hilarious.

24:02.607 --> 24:04.407
- They thought it was funny.
- Mm-hmm.

24:04.409 --> 24:06.309
Yeah.

24:06.311 --> 24:11.181
I mean, I don't know why you fucking could
care about what she thinks anyway, right?

24:11.183 --> 24:12.749
I don't care about
what she thinks, Donald.

24:12.751 --> 24:13.783
- You sure?
- Yeah.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.518
- You seem like you do.
- I don't care, dude!

24:15.520 --> 24:18.080
Dude, I don't care about anybody
in this town. Do you understand?

24:19.123 --> 24:22.325
Man, I really appreciate
you coming and taking me...

24:22.327 --> 24:24.027
- are you mad?
- I'm not mad.

24:24.029 --> 24:25.562
I just...

24:25.564 --> 24:29.032
If I could just get that money,
uh, you know, I lost my wallet,

24:29.034 --> 24:30.467
I'm really in a spot,

24:30.469 --> 24:32.535
I'm dealing with this
Nona stuff. I just...

24:32.537 --> 24:35.271
If you could give that to me, I'm
going to grab a cab, and just...

24:35.273 --> 24:36.606
You know, hit the road.

24:37.341 --> 24:38.608
Okay?

24:38.610 --> 24:40.310
All right. I mean...

24:42.146 --> 24:44.781
I don't have any money.
I just spent it.

24:46.050 --> 24:47.750
I bought us breakfast.

24:48.185 --> 24:49.285
So, I can get...

24:49.287 --> 24:50.887
Well, just give me
what you have then.

24:50.889 --> 24:52.522
Well, I don't have
anything on me.

24:52.524 --> 24:57.227
I could get some, or I could see,
but I can't promise anything.

24:57.229 --> 25:00.563
You know, but I could see
what I could do.

25:00.565 --> 25:02.966
- All right. Let's do that.
- You look fucking mad.

25:02.968 --> 25:05.902
Dude, you look like you're
gonna fucking kill somebody.

25:05.904 --> 25:08.671
You look like you're gonna
fucking kill somebody.

25:22.086 --> 25:23.520
Fuck!

25:25.122 --> 25:26.990
- Eighth place.
- Great, let's go.

25:26.992 --> 25:29.926
I haven't been able to...
That's the best I've gotten...

25:29.928 --> 25:32.295
- Please, come on.
- For some reason I can't get to b8.

25:48.746 --> 25:51.414
That's my opening attempt, 650.

25:52.049 --> 25:53.249
That's 650!

25:53.251 --> 25:54.450
That's like eight of you.

25:54.452 --> 25:57.053
Who do you like, a buck, ten?

25:57.055 --> 25:58.388
Look at that.
I'm getting fired up.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.757
The crowd's getting fired up.
They smell seven.

26:00.759 --> 26:03.393
Seven hundred is
going to fall that day.

26:04.695 --> 26:05.962
See that belt I got on?

26:05.964 --> 26:07.564
So I don't get a hernia.

26:08.065 --> 26:09.165
Now, they're crying.

26:09.167 --> 26:10.133
Crying...

26:10.135 --> 26:11.467
They want 700 pounds.

26:11.469 --> 26:13.703
Seven hundred pounds, sorry.

26:13.705 --> 26:14.904
Amazing.

26:16.273 --> 26:17.874
You're late, what do you want?

26:18.943 --> 26:21.010
I just wanted you to, uh...

26:22.413 --> 26:24.714
- I wanted you to meet somebody.
- We're not fucking hiring!

26:24.716 --> 26:26.683
He's not looking
for a job, he, uh...

26:27.284 --> 26:28.651
He's just, uh...

26:28.653 --> 26:31.955
He's just in from...
From outta town.

26:31.957 --> 26:33.990
- I'm Donald's boss. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

26:33.992 --> 26:36.092
What are you,
fucking high? What is this?

26:36.094 --> 26:40.930
He's, uh... he got... He's kind of in a
little bit of a tough spot right now, so...

26:40.932 --> 26:45.034
I feel like I need to just,
kinda, like, help him out a bit.

26:45.036 --> 26:47.570
Yeah, so?

26:47.572 --> 26:50.139
I just haven't seen him
in a while, and it's...

26:50.141 --> 26:51.474
It would kind of
be tough if I...

26:51.476 --> 26:52.508
I don't give a shit!

26:52.510 --> 26:53.910
Had to work when he was here...

26:53.912 --> 26:57.513
- Donald, seriously, I can just go.
- No, no, no, no, no.

26:57.515 --> 26:59.549
Are you working? Yes or no?

26:59.551 --> 27:01.150
That's all I want
to know. Yes or no?

27:01.152 --> 27:02.685
I could call Julio.

27:02.687 --> 27:04.520
I'm not asking you
to call fucking Julio.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.022
You're supposed to be
working right now!

27:06.024 --> 27:07.957
- I can work tonight, I can do it tonight.
- So it's a no.

27:07.959 --> 27:09.926
Basically you said
you're not working right now.

27:09.928 --> 27:11.094
You just came in here...

27:11.096 --> 27:13.363
I'm telling you, I can just go.
It's fine, okay?

27:13.365 --> 27:15.398
This is what he does to me.
He embarrasses me.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.400
He embarrasses me!
He makes up his own rules.

27:17.402 --> 27:20.803
He thinks that nothing applies to him, that
he can come and go as he fucking pleases!

27:22.139 --> 27:23.339
You want the day off?

27:24.274 --> 27:26.242
Uh, I would.
I'd appreciate it,

27:26.244 --> 27:27.610
- and I also...
- do you want it?

27:27.612 --> 27:29.245
Yeah. And if I could
get my check...

27:29.247 --> 27:31.381
You want the day off,
and you want your check too.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.583
You want the money, but you
don't want to work for it!

27:33.585 --> 27:35.251
There's something
you can do for me though.

27:35.253 --> 27:36.853
Yeah, what?
Like, what do you need?

27:36.855 --> 27:38.888
- You want the day off, right?
- Yeah, that'd be fucking cool.

27:38.890 --> 27:40.990
You can fucking blow me!
You can fucking blow me now!

27:40.992 --> 27:43.226
That's what you can fucking do!
Blow me right now!

27:43.228 --> 27:44.894
- Fucking blow me! Yeah!
- Stop!

27:44.896 --> 27:47.864
Yeah, you can
fucking suck my dick!

27:47.866 --> 27:49.065
Let go of me!

27:49.067 --> 27:51.401
Fucking suck my dick!
That's what you can fucking do!

27:51.403 --> 27:52.635
- Fuck you! Get off.
- Suck it off!

27:52.637 --> 27:54.303
- Get off me, fuck you!
- Yeah, suck it!

27:54.305 --> 27:56.172
- Fucking suck it, right now!
- Get off!

27:56.174 --> 27:58.041
- Fucking taking days off!
- Get off!

27:58.842 --> 28:00.510
Fuck!

28:00.512 --> 28:02.245
It's not funny, is it, huh?

28:02.247 --> 28:03.579
Yeah.

28:08.285 --> 28:11.187
- Fucking happy now, huh?
- Oh, fuck you!

28:11.189 --> 28:12.822
Fucking late half the time.

28:12.824 --> 28:15.558
- Here, that's a day's pay.
- Thank you.

28:15.560 --> 28:16.726
"Thank you."

28:16.728 --> 28:18.227
You're gonna fucking
skip next week too?

28:18.229 --> 28:19.595
No, I'll be in tomorrow.

28:19.597 --> 28:22.398
- Yeah, get your fucking cookies. Fuck you.
- Oh, fuck off.

28:56.200 --> 28:57.633
Are you all right, man?

28:58.836 --> 28:59.969
What, about in there?

28:59.971 --> 29:00.903
Yeah.

29:00.905 --> 29:03.806
Oh, man, that's just
us fucking around.

29:03.808 --> 29:05.475
Donald, that's
completely inappropriate.

29:05.477 --> 29:07.243
I mean, no one does that.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.311
That's ridiculous.

29:08.313 --> 29:09.912
No, man, that was fun!

29:09.914 --> 29:11.547
I had fucking fun, dude.

29:11.549 --> 29:13.783
That guy is a fucking asshole.

29:13.785 --> 29:15.418
You should not be working here.

29:15.420 --> 29:16.786
- It's that simple.
- I know it seems like that,

29:16.788 --> 29:19.388
but it's just shit that we do.
Me and him do.

29:19.390 --> 29:22.091
No, you just let yourself get
disrespected, dude. This is ridiculous.

29:22.093 --> 29:24.193
It's just two guys pushing
each other's buttons!

29:24.195 --> 29:26.696
I like shit like that!
You know that.

29:26.698 --> 29:28.865
Man, I fucking live for
that type of stuff.

29:29.633 --> 29:31.033
You just don't know us.

29:31.035 --> 29:33.136
You just saw a side of us.

29:33.138 --> 29:36.105
I fucking live for that
type of play. You know that.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.580
Hey, don, I really
appreciate this, man.

29:44.582 --> 29:46.115
Yeah, how much do you need?

29:46.117 --> 29:47.517
Would 100 be cool?

29:47.519 --> 29:49.085
Oh, you need that much?

29:49.087 --> 29:50.119
Uh...

29:50.121 --> 29:51.187
You know, whatever you got.

29:51.189 --> 29:53.422
- Well, I got 83 right here.
- Okay.

29:53.424 --> 29:54.557
Yeah, that's perfect. Yeah...

29:54.559 --> 29:56.893
Uh, but, I'm...

29:56.895 --> 29:58.928
I'm just thinking about it,
it's like,

29:58.930 --> 30:02.031
I do actually owe somebody
80 dollars already.

30:02.033 --> 30:05.701
And maybe I should
just talk to him first.

30:05.703 --> 30:09.005
I'm gonna get back to the city,
I'm gonna write you a check.

30:09.007 --> 30:12.542
But I'm thinking, you know what,
here, take three right now.

30:12.544 --> 30:16.445
And don't worry about that. Take the
three, and then we'll talk to him.

30:16.447 --> 30:19.749
And I'm sure he's gonna let me slide, but
I just have to do it out of respect.

30:19.751 --> 30:21.784
So, here, take the three now...

30:21.786 --> 30:24.754
And then we'll get this
other 80 cleared, okay?

30:26.056 --> 30:28.891
It's just what I have to do,
Pete, you know...

30:28.893 --> 30:33.496
This guy let me borrow some money,
I gotta at least respect him.

30:33.498 --> 30:34.964
And we'll clear it with him.

30:34.966 --> 30:37.700
He's gonna be fucking
totally cool with it, but...

30:37.702 --> 30:39.802
It's just how
we work around here.

30:40.704 --> 30:42.238
It's a respect thing.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.840
All right.

30:46.610 --> 30:48.444
I can't...

30:48.446 --> 30:53.015
This is why I don't come to this one,
because this fucking parking lot sucks.

30:53.617 --> 30:55.117
Uh-huh.

30:55.119 --> 30:56.819
It's too tight.

30:56.821 --> 30:59.755
And you know when they plow...
These are all usually spots.

30:59.757 --> 31:04.126
But when they plow, they have nowhere
else to go with it so they block 'em.

31:08.165 --> 31:10.967
Hey, get out from under
there, what are you doing?

31:10.969 --> 31:12.101
Don't eat that!

31:14.004 --> 31:15.304
Disgusting!

31:16.740 --> 31:18.541
So you're looking at
20 bucks for five pills,

31:18.543 --> 31:21.110
so if you want ten you do 40, right?
Do me a 40.

31:21.112 --> 31:24.614
All right, give me, uh,
give me the muscle relaxants.

31:24.616 --> 31:27.316
- You want the muscle relaxants?
- Yeah, those didn't agree with me

31:27.318 --> 31:28.551
the last time I took them.

31:28.553 --> 31:29.619
Don't take too many. 40 bucks.

31:29.621 --> 31:31.220
All right, man.
I know how to do it.

31:31.222 --> 31:32.788
He's cool, man,
don't worry about it.

31:32.790 --> 31:34.156
He doesn't look cool.

31:34.158 --> 31:35.958
No, he's fine, man.

31:37.794 --> 31:39.962
I'm gonna fucking take
one of these right now.

31:40.530 --> 31:41.564
Do you want one?

31:41.566 --> 31:42.765
No, I'm good.

31:42.767 --> 31:43.566
My treat.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.301
No, no, I already took one, man.

31:47.371 --> 31:49.171
Don't take too many of those.

31:51.008 --> 31:53.442
What are you guys up to right now?
You want to get gaming?

31:53.444 --> 31:55.177
Yeah. I'll throw it around.

31:55.179 --> 31:56.379
Why? You down?

31:56.381 --> 31:58.748
Here's the deal, just fucking
stare at him, all right?

31:58.750 --> 32:00.049
Just lock him down.

32:02.085 --> 32:03.352
What's up, are we all set?

32:03.354 --> 32:05.721
No, we're in a little bit
of trouble.

32:05.723 --> 32:08.824
It appears that Dwayne
is running things right now.

32:10.327 --> 32:11.861
What the fuck does that mean?

32:11.863 --> 32:15.765
It means that he's not prepared
to let me slide with the money

32:15.767 --> 32:17.667
unless we play football.

32:19.870 --> 32:22.338
Then tell him no,
I'm not playing football.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.572
I'm not fucking telling him no.

32:23.574 --> 32:25.241
- He's crazy.
- Donald, come on.

32:25.243 --> 32:26.642
This dude is fucking crazy.

32:26.644 --> 32:27.777
Fucking no.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.446
These guys are from vets.
They went to vets.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.914
They play by different rules.

32:31.916 --> 32:34.450
I'm telling you, if you wanna
get out of here and not pay,

32:34.452 --> 32:36.519
we are gonna have
to fucking throw down.

32:36.521 --> 32:39.755
Donald, Jesus, fucking,
come on, man.

32:39.757 --> 32:41.691
Oh, let's go!
You playing or what?

32:41.693 --> 32:44.327
It's up to you. It's a pay
or play situation.

32:46.396 --> 32:47.730
This is fucking ridiculous!

32:47.732 --> 32:49.265
He's gonna wanna throw down.

32:50.600 --> 32:51.901
All right, let's just
fucking do it then.

32:51.903 --> 32:53.269
- All right.
- One touchdown.

32:53.271 --> 32:54.904
Let's just go, let's just get this done.
Ridiculous.

32:54.906 --> 32:58.040
All right, let's go, he's in!

32:58.042 --> 33:02.144
I want to set it up so that me
and him are on opposite teams.

33:07.251 --> 33:09.151
Yeah!

33:16.094 --> 33:17.793
Fuck, yeah!

33:18.161 --> 33:19.495
Fuck, yeah!

33:19.497 --> 33:20.563
He's on the one yard line.

33:20.565 --> 33:21.564
That's a first down.

33:21.566 --> 33:22.965
That's a first down, Donald.

33:24.301 --> 33:26.369
Yeah!

33:26.870 --> 33:28.137
See that?

33:29.306 --> 33:30.439
Come on. Let's go.

33:30.441 --> 33:31.507
Let's do this.

33:31.509 --> 33:32.775
Shuffle!

33:33.477 --> 33:35.511
Yeah! Yeah!

33:35.513 --> 33:37.113
- Yeah!
- All right, aargh!

33:37.115 --> 33:38.147
Time out.

33:38.149 --> 33:39.081
Time out.

33:39.083 --> 33:40.716
Why, why?

33:40.718 --> 33:42.118
I don't know, I just...

33:42.120 --> 33:45.755
I feel like the painkillers
are starting to set in.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.790
Come on, Donald, let's go!

33:47.792 --> 33:49.959
They'll come up, take the right
and come back down.

33:49.961 --> 33:51.127
Hut!

33:51.129 --> 33:52.928
One, one thousand,
two, one thousand...

33:52.930 --> 33:54.130
Oh, fuck.

33:54.564 --> 33:55.998
Here, go!

34:01.973 --> 34:03.039
Ow.

34:03.041 --> 34:04.073
Yeah!

34:04.075 --> 34:05.574
- All right. All right.
- Oh, fuck...

34:05.576 --> 34:06.842
Yeah, boy!

34:06.844 --> 34:08.777
- That's it.
- Yeah, son.

34:08.780 --> 34:11.679
It's not like
it used to be, right?

34:11.681 --> 34:13.248
It's not like it used to be.

34:13.251 --> 34:14.750
Fuck.

34:14.752 --> 34:15.885
- All right.
- Fuck, yeah!

34:15.887 --> 34:17.319
I think that's it.

34:17.321 --> 34:18.888
That's it for me.

34:18.889 --> 34:20.556
Is that it?

34:20.558 --> 34:21.791
Are you done?

34:21.793 --> 34:23.391
Yeah, let's go.

34:24.527 --> 34:26.161
- Good game, guys.
- Are you serious?

34:28.398 --> 34:29.831
Let's go, Donald.

34:39.876 --> 34:41.643
You know what I would
change about myself?

34:41.646 --> 34:44.880
You know what the one thing would
be I had to change about myself?

34:49.686 --> 34:51.219
What's that, Donald?

34:51.222 --> 34:52.487
My competitiveness.

34:52.489 --> 34:54.023
Mm, yeah, that'd be
the one thing?

34:54.025 --> 34:55.491
- That would be it.
- Yeah.

34:55.493 --> 34:56.659
Yeah. I get swept up in it.

34:56.661 --> 34:57.993
Makes sense.

34:57.995 --> 35:00.629
I really do feel I get
carried away sometimes.

35:00.631 --> 35:02.164
It's cool, don.

35:02.566 --> 35:03.933
It's cool?

35:04.801 --> 35:06.302
You had fun

35:06.670 --> 35:08.437
doing that?

35:08.439 --> 35:10.139
- You had fun?
- Yeah, I had fun.

35:10.141 --> 35:11.373
Yeah?

35:11.375 --> 35:14.076
- You really did?
- I did. I did. It was cool.

35:16.613 --> 35:19.648
Donald, it's straight ahead.
Donald, it's straight ahead!

35:19.650 --> 35:20.850
You know what we're gonna do?

35:20.852 --> 35:22.118
Actually, I just
thought about...

35:22.120 --> 35:23.752
don, it's...
don, it's this...

35:23.754 --> 35:26.555
We're gonna go see, Touty. We're
gonna go see the godfather.

35:26.557 --> 35:27.756
Donald, no.

35:27.758 --> 35:30.092
I have an appointment
in ten minutes.

35:30.094 --> 35:32.094
Donald, I need to be
at the nursing home.

35:32.096 --> 35:33.929
We are in Touty's
neighborhood right now.

35:33.931 --> 35:38.234
If he knew we were here and we didn't
stop by, he would throw a fucking fit.

35:38.236 --> 35:40.002
I'm not doing this again.
Please, turn the car around.

35:40.004 --> 35:41.437
I need you to go to
the nursing home.

35:41.439 --> 35:43.672
We gotta do it. He'll fucking
kill me if we don't.

35:43.674 --> 35:45.241
And it's something
I got to deal with.

35:45.243 --> 35:46.742
I'll take you to
the nursing home,

35:46.744 --> 35:49.145
but we just have to do
this one thing, okay?

35:51.248 --> 35:52.248
There's no way out.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.817
This, and then
the nursing home, okay?

36:09.699 --> 36:12.034
Yo, what's up?

36:13.003 --> 36:16.305
Look who's, uh, back
in town to come see you.

36:18.241 --> 36:19.475
What's up, Touty?

36:22.379 --> 36:23.979
How are you doing?

36:27.584 --> 36:29.451
What are you guys up to?
You just...

36:29.686 --> 36:31.020
Kinda...

36:31.022 --> 36:32.421
Doing this, watching this?

36:36.927 --> 36:38.994
You mind if I hit that?

36:42.432 --> 36:43.499
You want any?

36:43.501 --> 36:44.567
No, I'm good.

36:44.569 --> 36:46.135
- You sure?
- Yeah.

36:50.140 --> 36:51.874
Touty, what have you
been up to, man?

36:53.910 --> 36:55.477
Just roofing.

36:55.912 --> 36:57.213
Construction.

36:57.814 --> 36:59.949
Nice.

36:59.951 --> 37:02.585
Dude, I just saw your brother
the fucking other day.

37:02.587 --> 37:05.354
That kid is a fucking beast.

37:08.091 --> 37:09.792
He's a fucking Ace.

37:09.794 --> 37:12.461
- Fucking jacked up, man.
- Yeah.

37:21.338 --> 37:24.707
He must be absolutely
just like...

37:24.709 --> 37:27.443
Fucking tripping out
right now, right?

37:27.445 --> 37:31.447
He likes seeing us, the three
amigos, back in town again.

37:37.087 --> 37:38.887
Like someone
just took your brain,

37:38.889 --> 37:41.757
and dropped it down
into a time hole.

37:41.759 --> 37:44.426
Just being here
with fucking ITT.

37:45.629 --> 37:49.265
Latang, Touty, Treebeck.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.301
The fucking three horsemen
letting it ride again.

37:54.638 --> 37:56.238
Remember the last time
I saw you?

38:00.310 --> 38:02.478
At Chrissy's graduation party?

38:05.949 --> 38:07.483
You pissed in a bottle.

38:08.752 --> 38:10.352
Made Donald drink it.

38:13.823 --> 38:15.624
Everyone laughed at him.

38:16.826 --> 38:18.327
You made Donald cry.

38:27.203 --> 38:29.338
I just remember thinking
if that was me...

38:32.609 --> 38:34.376
I would've knocked you out.

38:46.489 --> 38:48.057
I got 40 bucks.

38:49.726 --> 38:51.360
- I don't want it.
- Take it.

38:53.063 --> 38:55.064
- Take it.
- I don't want it, Donald.

38:55.066 --> 38:56.231
- I thought you needed it?
- No.

38:56.233 --> 38:57.700
- Take it!
- I don't want it.

38:57.702 --> 38:58.834
- Take the money.
- Stop!

38:58.836 --> 38:59.802
Just watch the road, okay?

38:59.804 --> 39:02.771
- Donald, get it out of my...
- I want you to take the money.

39:02.773 --> 39:05.107
- I want you to take the money.
- Put the fucking money away!

39:05.109 --> 39:05.808
No, take it.

39:05.810 --> 39:06.875
- No.
- Take it.

39:06.877 --> 39:07.876
Stop!

39:07.878 --> 39:09.578
- Take the fucking money.
- Donald...

39:09.580 --> 39:11.914
Take the fucking money or I'm gonna
stick it in your fucking pocket.

39:11.916 --> 39:14.249
I don't want
your fucking money, man!

39:14.251 --> 39:15.718
Well, now it's gonna
fucking stay up there...

39:15.720 --> 39:17.619
Then leave it there! -...And
no one's gonna have it.

39:17.621 --> 39:19.121
Just fucking listen to me!

39:22.092 --> 39:25.332
I don't want it to stay up there 'cause
then it might fucking blow out the window.

39:25.995 --> 39:27.463
Then none of us will have it.

39:28.965 --> 39:30.966
Retard.

39:30.968 --> 39:32.634
What'd you call me?

40:00.296 --> 40:02.431
I don't know...

40:02.433 --> 40:04.233
I don't know if I should
be concerned or not,

40:04.235 --> 40:07.236
but does he seem like he might
be suffering from depression

40:07.704 --> 40:09.171
to you?

40:12.041 --> 40:15.010
I don't know.
Do you think that that was helpful,

40:15.012 --> 40:16.345
us going over there?

40:16.347 --> 40:18.847
I don't feel like I really
cheered him up, Donald.

40:20.049 --> 40:22.117
No, I think you did.

40:22.119 --> 40:23.852
That's how he is
all the time now.

40:23.854 --> 40:27.489
That's why I'm saying, I don't know
if I should be concerned or not.

40:27.491 --> 40:30.426
Well, it was fun for me, so...

40:31.294 --> 40:32.628
Thanks.

40:36.666 --> 40:39.268
You sure you don't
want me to hang here at all?

40:39.270 --> 40:40.702
Yeah. Yeah.

40:40.704 --> 40:42.671
I mean, I could just
wait right outside here.

40:42.673 --> 40:44.239
No, don, really, it's fine.

40:44.241 --> 40:46.241
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

40:46.243 --> 40:48.076
Well, you know
you can call me, right?

40:48.078 --> 40:49.578
If you need to,
you will call me?

40:49.580 --> 40:50.746
I do, I do.

40:50.748 --> 40:52.214
- Thanks a lot, man.
- Do you know what you're doing?

40:52.216 --> 40:54.183
Yeah. I got stuff to do
in there. But, really...

40:54.185 --> 40:55.384
you sure you'll be all right?

40:55.386 --> 40:56.985
It's been good to
see you, all right?

40:56.987 --> 40:59.388
All right, it's good
seeing you too, man.

41:00.657 --> 41:02.357
I missed you.

41:04.093 --> 41:05.994
All right,
I can grab that for you.

41:05.996 --> 41:07.629
No, I'm good. I'm good.

41:07.631 --> 41:09.064
All right.

41:09.066 --> 41:11.667
Just like I said,
if you need me call me.

41:12.135 --> 41:13.335
All right, don.

41:13.337 --> 41:15.204
- All right.
- I'll see ya.

41:23.012 --> 41:24.480
Just, uh, hey...

41:25.048 --> 41:27.182
If there's, just...

41:27.184 --> 41:30.819
I don't know. Remember,
whatever I did, or do, I...

41:30.821 --> 41:32.488
I did it for Nona, okay?

41:33.823 --> 41:35.190
Okay.

41:38.695 --> 41:42.464
<i>I'm the youngest of eight kids.</i>

41:42.466 --> 41:47.035
And... my mother and father
were never in a nursing home,

41:47.037 --> 41:49.605
we always took care of them.

41:51.241 --> 41:53.709
I spent a lot of time
doing that.

41:56.679 --> 41:58.213
That's really nice.

41:58.748 --> 41:59.882
Peter.

41:59.884 --> 42:01.016
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm Barbara.

42:01.018 --> 42:02.584
I'm so sorry about
your grandmother.

42:02.586 --> 42:05.921
I actually transferred here
from another home,

42:05.923 --> 42:08.156
the day after she passed, so,

42:08.158 --> 42:11.660
um, I never really got
a chance to meet her, but...

42:11.662 --> 42:14.329
Um, from what everyone says,
she was a wonderful lady.

42:14.331 --> 42:15.864
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

42:15.866 --> 42:17.232
Yeah, she was.

42:18.635 --> 42:22.838
Uh, is there any questions
I could answer for you, or...

42:22.840 --> 42:25.307
Uh, I'm sure
if I don't know something,

42:25.309 --> 42:27.509
there's people here who've
been here longer

42:27.511 --> 42:30.412
who could sit down
and talk with you.

42:30.414 --> 42:33.549
Yeah, no, if I think of anything
I'll ask,

42:33.551 --> 42:35.951
but I'm just here to, you know,

42:35.953 --> 42:37.686
- collect her affairs.
- Okay.

42:38.988 --> 42:41.857
Um, she came in
with very little?

42:42.759 --> 42:43.892
- Yeah.
- Okay.

42:43.894 --> 42:45.327
I just wanted to make sure.

42:45.962 --> 42:48.030
Um, okay, so it's right here,

42:48.032 --> 42:49.898
twenty two.

42:49.900 --> 42:53.201
And I think you'll find
there's a small box there

42:53.203 --> 42:56.338
with some photos
and other knick knacks, so...

42:57.340 --> 42:58.941
Make yourself at home.

42:58.943 --> 43:02.077
Um, there's no rush, and if you
need me I'll be in my office.

43:02.079 --> 43:03.145
- Okay.
- Okay.

43:03.147 --> 43:04.546
- Thank you.
- Bye bye.

44:17.253 --> 44:18.787
Excuse me, sir.

44:20.490 --> 44:23.458
- Yes?
- We need to see some ID.

44:52.121 --> 44:53.922
He was out on the grounds.

44:58.294 --> 44:59.728
Thank you.

45:01.364 --> 45:02.297
- Hi, there.
- Barbara.

45:02.299 --> 45:04.499
Donald Treebeck.

45:04.501 --> 45:07.436
We seem to have some
identity issue here.

45:07.804 --> 45:09.171
Yes, he, uh...

45:09.173 --> 45:11.540
This gentleman informed me
of that, so...

45:12.542 --> 45:16.845
I'm Donald Treebeck,
this is <i>the</i> Peter latang.

45:18.081 --> 45:19.448
Continue.

45:19.816 --> 45:20.982
Um...

45:22.051 --> 45:23.318
Just from...

45:23.320 --> 45:25.821
Like the whole... okay.

45:25.823 --> 45:27.789
Uh, how are you doing?

45:29.459 --> 45:32.461
Um, yeah, I mean,
I just came and...

45:32.463 --> 45:37.666
He was coming to visit Nona, and I also
really wanted to get his contact information

45:37.668 --> 45:40.335
because we hadn't
seen each other for a while.

45:40.337 --> 45:42.170
So, which you guys
couldn't give out

45:42.172 --> 45:44.139
- because of the legalities.
- Mm-hmm.

45:44.141 --> 45:45.107
Is that right?

45:45.109 --> 45:47.309
- Yeah, uh...
- Mm-hmm.

45:47.311 --> 45:50.746
And, so Nona, just,
you know, her condition...

45:50.748 --> 45:54.416
She didn't know much
of anything at this point,

45:54.418 --> 45:57.819
and she just assumed I was you.

45:57.821 --> 46:00.155
And so I didn't want
to let her down

46:00.157 --> 46:04.226
and, uh, you know, really, everything I
was doing was from my heart, really.

46:04.228 --> 46:08.630
I felt like it was the best thing to do,
for her to have you back in her life,

46:08.632 --> 46:10.365
so I just played you.

46:10.367 --> 46:15.403
And the more I played him, and the
farther I went into this hole of lies,

46:15.405 --> 46:19.341
people around started questioning,
you know. Not questioning,

46:19.343 --> 46:21.209
thinking I was you.

46:21.211 --> 46:25.881
So, I mean, it was really like,
a heartfelt mix-up,

46:25.883 --> 46:27.649
where everybody around

46:27.651 --> 46:29.785
just assumed I was him.

46:29.787 --> 46:32.120
For like six years
that was going on.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.189
- And, uh...
- What?

46:34.191 --> 46:38.326
Yeah, and I thought about this day,
I waited for this day to happen,

46:38.328 --> 46:40.061
where we're both gonna, like...

46:40.063 --> 46:42.164
Come in to this place
and see each other,

46:42.166 --> 46:45.467
and everyone's like, "wait,
who's who? Wait, you are...

46:45.469 --> 46:48.136
You and him..."
Have you ever seen...

46:48.138 --> 46:50.906
What's the movie with John
Travolta and Nick cage

46:50.908 --> 46:54.409
- where they take each other's identities?
- -Okay!

46:54.411 --> 46:57.145
Uh, I don't know what
you want to do,

46:57.147 --> 47:02.017
but I don't think anything
illegal actually took place.

47:02.019 --> 47:03.985
Fuck, no.

47:03.987 --> 47:06.621
I mean, it was really...
It was something that was from,

47:06.623 --> 47:08.089
I felt like it was from my...

47:08.091 --> 47:10.091
Doing the best
what I thought was the best.

47:10.093 --> 47:12.761
If we're all done here I'd like to
get the hell out of here, please.

47:12.763 --> 47:15.697
Yeah. Is there anything
we can do for you?

47:16.432 --> 47:17.732
You've done more than enough.

47:17.734 --> 47:20.135
I... I...
I'm very sorry.

47:21.170 --> 47:22.537
You got that?

47:23.539 --> 47:25.106
Excuse me.

47:30.913 --> 47:33.348
Do you need me
to sign off on anything?

47:33.350 --> 47:34.482
Please leave.

47:41.290 --> 47:42.591
Hey.

47:43.226 --> 47:45.026
Hey, get in the car, man.

47:46.128 --> 47:47.262
Pete?

47:48.264 --> 47:49.898
Come on, Pete,
get in the car, man.

47:50.700 --> 47:52.200
Where are you going?

47:53.669 --> 47:55.537
It's fucked up, don!

47:57.740 --> 48:00.208
- I'm sorry, I...
- why didn't you tell me?

48:00.210 --> 48:03.144
I did. I tried. That's what I tried
to say when you were leaving.

48:03.146 --> 48:06.214
- I wanted to tell you, I told you...
- I didn't know what that meant!

48:08.050 --> 48:10.085
I just didn't wanna...

48:10.087 --> 48:11.820
I didn't wanna
tell you 'cause...

48:11.822 --> 48:13.588
It's fucking weird that you
were doing it anyway, Donald!

48:13.590 --> 48:14.823
It's fucking strange!

48:14.825 --> 48:17.259
I didn't want you to
feel bad about it.

48:19.896 --> 48:21.596
Why is that?

48:21.598 --> 48:24.199
Because I didn't want you to feel bad,
like, that you weren't here to seize...

48:24.201 --> 48:27.269
You don't have to worry
about how I feel, man!

48:27.271 --> 48:29.771
I have this!
I had this, I...

48:29.773 --> 48:32.407
I had my relationship
with my grandma, all right?

48:32.409 --> 48:34.009
- I know you do.
- I don't need you

48:34.011 --> 48:35.610
pretending to be me!

48:35.612 --> 48:38.914
Okay? I have my reasons why I
didn't fucking come back here!

48:40.149 --> 48:42.050
I hope it's nothing I did,
you know. I mean...

48:42.052 --> 48:44.819
no, Donald,
it's not about you, man!

48:44.821 --> 48:48.556
It's not! Look, I don't like
this place, do you understand?

48:48.558 --> 48:51.059
I don't like how I feel
when I come back here.

48:51.061 --> 48:52.294
All right?

48:52.296 --> 48:55.297
So, if it's been 20 years,
then it's fucking been 20 years!

48:55.299 --> 48:56.898
I'm sorry, I just...

48:59.468 --> 49:02.904
I don't like who I am when
I'm back here, you understand?

49:02.906 --> 49:04.973
Yeah, man, I don't fucking...

49:04.975 --> 49:07.776
I just don't think
you should sweat it. I just...

49:09.845 --> 49:13.615
Let me fucking give you a ride,
you have all this shit.

49:14.784 --> 49:16.751
Where are we even going?

49:18.487 --> 49:19.888
Where were you going?

49:45.815 --> 49:47.849
This is a good spot.

49:50.419 --> 49:51.820
Yeah.

49:52.955 --> 49:54.356
It is great.

49:58.728 --> 50:00.161
Can you hold this?

50:13.309 --> 50:14.442
Mm.

50:15.011 --> 50:16.177
Yeah.

50:17.413 --> 50:19.147
Well...

50:19.149 --> 50:19.981
You going to do it?

50:19.983 --> 50:21.282
Well, there's not a scooper.

50:21.284 --> 50:22.817
Just use your hands.

50:23.386 --> 50:24.686
You want me to do it?

50:24.688 --> 50:26.321
No, no, I'll do it.

50:31.360 --> 50:32.861
Here, take the top.

50:34.830 --> 50:37.032
You mind if I say
something first?

50:37.967 --> 50:39.834
- Just a few words?
- All right.

50:45.007 --> 50:46.841
Um...

50:46.843 --> 50:49.944
I just want to
take a moment to...

50:51.180 --> 50:54.883
Give bless to god
for creating Nona.

50:56.485 --> 51:01.723
And I want to thank her for all the
chill shit she used to do with us.

51:02.458 --> 51:03.725
And show me...

51:03.727 --> 51:05.326
Show me stuff.

51:08.197 --> 51:09.497
Thank you.

51:11.333 --> 51:12.734
Amen.

51:13.469 --> 51:14.803
Amen.

51:20.242 --> 51:21.309
Can I do one?

51:23.112 --> 51:24.345
Yeah, sure.

51:25.648 --> 51:27.248
No, don't, no, don't do that.

51:27.950 --> 51:30.251
I was doing it for grip.

51:30.253 --> 51:31.853
- Use your other hand.
- I'm right-handed.

51:31.855 --> 51:33.855
- Don't.
- All right.

51:50.372 --> 51:51.906
Drop it.

51:53.576 --> 51:56.244
I know she's still on us.

51:56.246 --> 51:57.345
Yeah.

51:59.448 --> 52:00.915
You could use the snow.

52:04.720 --> 52:06.121
Here.

52:07.156 --> 52:08.957
Okay, Nona, that's enough.

52:09.859 --> 52:11.326
You can go now.

52:37.486 --> 52:39.387
I'm waiting for you.

52:39.389 --> 52:42.624
I don't want to do anything
unless you tell me.

52:42.626 --> 52:44.125
Um...

52:44.760 --> 52:46.728
All right. Well...

52:46.730 --> 52:48.830
What do you think about...

52:48.832 --> 52:51.866
Maybe, uh, smoking some...

52:51.868 --> 52:53.902
Some weed. Do you have any weed?

52:54.870 --> 52:57.071
Yeah. You want to smoke weed?

52:57.073 --> 52:58.173
Yes.

52:58.707 --> 53:00.408
- You do?
- Yeah.

53:02.344 --> 53:03.578
Really?

53:03.580 --> 53:05.446
Yeah, let's go
and smoke some weed.

53:05.448 --> 53:07.248
You want to smoke weed with me?

53:08.184 --> 53:09.284
- Yes.
- Yeah.

53:09.286 --> 53:11.452
Fuck, I mean,
I thought you had...

53:11.921 --> 53:13.755
Stuff you had to do.

53:13.757 --> 53:16.758
No, I... no, it's all done.
No, I...

53:16.760 --> 53:19.127
No. Sorry if I was, like,
kinda crazy earlier.

53:19.129 --> 53:21.396
I don't want you to be
sorry about anything

53:21.398 --> 53:24.566
because I knew today,
getting involved with you,

53:24.568 --> 53:25.934
it was going to be tough,

53:25.936 --> 53:29.137
kind of a tough day because
of your mourning process.

53:29.139 --> 53:32.740
If smoking weed is
going to help you out,

53:32.742 --> 53:34.776
then that's what we need to do.

53:34.778 --> 53:36.477
Doctor's orders.

53:37.713 --> 53:39.981
Do you want to go
to the fucking spot?

53:40.549 --> 53:42.217
- Do you want...
- can we?

53:42.219 --> 53:43.151
- In this?
- Yeah.

53:43.153 --> 53:44.586
Yeah, let's take it
to the next step.

53:44.588 --> 53:47.855
Let's take a step further
and go to the fucking spot.

53:47.857 --> 53:49.591
- All right.
- All right?

53:49.593 --> 53:51.593
- Yeah.
- Oh, this is...

53:52.394 --> 53:53.828
Now we're getting to it.

53:53.830 --> 53:55.463
Now we're getting down to it.

53:57.132 --> 53:59.033
- Now we are?
- Yeah.

53:59.035 --> 54:00.935
Now, we definitely are.

54:04.773 --> 54:06.507
Here. You ready? Shotgun.

54:06.509 --> 54:08.076
No, don't shotgun me.

54:08.078 --> 54:09.677
- Shotgun it.
- No.

54:09.679 --> 54:11.045
- Why?
- Because I don't do that.

54:11.047 --> 54:12.680
- Shotgun me.
- I don't shotgun.

54:16.385 --> 54:17.685
There you go.

54:19.521 --> 54:20.955
Yeah.

54:34.870 --> 54:36.738
- Climb up it.
- All right.

54:36.740 --> 54:38.106
Let's see if you can.

54:43.746 --> 54:45.246
Uh, yeah.

54:50.619 --> 54:52.153
Oh, good god.

54:54.723 --> 54:55.990
Oh, shit.

54:55.992 --> 54:57.058
Yeah.

54:57.060 --> 54:59.160
The upper body.

54:59.162 --> 55:01.195
I went all the way
up this one time.

55:01.197 --> 55:04.098
- No, you didn't.
- I swear to god. I actually...

55:04.100 --> 55:06.401
Climbed this,
all the way to the top.

55:08.070 --> 55:10.371
I probably shouldn't do it
right now.

55:11.473 --> 55:13.141
Because my hands...

55:13.709 --> 55:15.009
Ow.

55:18.715 --> 55:20.148
Do you need me to save you?

55:20.150 --> 55:21.215
Hold on.

55:21.583 --> 55:23.117
Yeah, push...

55:23.952 --> 55:24.886
Just give you a push?

55:24.888 --> 55:26.754
No, no...

55:26.756 --> 55:28.423
What? What?

55:28.425 --> 55:30.224
No, my nuts are stuck.

55:30.226 --> 55:32.060
My nuts are stuck on to this.

55:32.062 --> 55:33.528
They're stuck. Ah!

55:33.530 --> 55:34.862
Okay, okay.

55:34.864 --> 55:36.397
Don't...

55:42.171 --> 55:44.272
- Are you all right?
- Ah, no.

55:44.907 --> 55:46.708
Ow!

55:46.710 --> 55:49.877
I didn't just want you to
push me, I was telling you

55:49.879 --> 55:53.348
how my balls were stuck
on a knot on it.

55:53.549 --> 55:54.749
<i>One.</i>

55:55.384 --> 55:56.384
<i>Two.</i>

55:56.952 --> 55:58.319
Three.

55:59.988 --> 56:02.090
- Oh, fuck!
- Nice, nice.

56:02.624 --> 56:04.092
Yeah!

56:06.795 --> 56:07.862
Wow.

56:07.864 --> 56:09.630
Yeah, you look good, man.

56:09.632 --> 56:11.399
- You think so?
- Yeah.

56:13.435 --> 56:16.037
Right now, I am...

56:16.039 --> 56:17.672
Feeling the best I've felt.

56:19.174 --> 56:21.609
This is the best I have felt

56:21.611 --> 56:23.177
in probably...

56:24.079 --> 56:25.346
Fifteen years.

56:25.848 --> 56:27.215
- Really?
- Yes.

56:27.217 --> 56:30.051
This is the best I have
felt in 15 years.

56:35.557 --> 56:36.824
Ow.

56:38.727 --> 56:39.927
Oh, shit.
The fucking cops.

56:39.929 --> 56:42.096
Oh, no, are they out there?

56:43.132 --> 56:44.966
All right, all right.

56:44.968 --> 56:46.634
No ice balls.

56:47.636 --> 56:49.137
Come on.

56:49.139 --> 56:50.471
- Come on!
- Oh, shit.

56:50.473 --> 56:51.839
Shit! I'm sorry.

56:53.242 --> 56:54.609
It's all right, it's good.

56:54.611 --> 56:57.645
Sometimes the competition
is a little bit too much for me.

57:09.057 --> 57:10.892
You're getting weak in the city.

57:10.894 --> 57:12.994
You've gotten weak
in the fucking city!

57:12.996 --> 57:14.328
Come on.

57:15.664 --> 57:17.532
Hey, you remember, um,

57:18.567 --> 57:20.868
Randy and Danny Dipmeyer?

57:22.805 --> 57:24.872
Yeah, I remember Randy.

57:24.874 --> 57:27.241
Yeah, well, his brother, Danny?

57:27.976 --> 57:29.010
Yeah.

57:29.012 --> 57:31.245
Like, four years ago,
he ended up

57:31.247 --> 57:34.449
getting into a motorcycle
accident, him and his dad,

57:34.451 --> 57:37.218
and they got hit in
a head-on collision,

57:37.220 --> 57:40.221
and Danny got
fucking ripped in half.

57:40.223 --> 57:42.590
They found him ripped in half.

57:43.725 --> 57:45.927
- Oh, Jesus.
- Isn't that fucking crazy?

57:45.929 --> 57:49.163
When they found him they found
his legs on one side of the road

57:49.165 --> 57:51.833
and his torso on the other side.

57:53.202 --> 57:54.235
Ain't that crazy?

57:54.237 --> 57:56.270
Yeah, that's fucked up, man.

57:56.272 --> 57:57.939
'Cause that's where
I get my stuff.

57:57.941 --> 58:01.676
Sometimes I go to Randy Stell,
which, he's not quite the same,

58:02.611 --> 58:03.644
but...

58:04.313 --> 58:06.481
You know, if you had to choose,

58:07.616 --> 58:09.584
who would it be?
You would pick Danny?

58:09.586 --> 58:12.920
If someone had to get ripped apart of
the two of them you would pick Danny.

58:25.767 --> 58:27.268
God, fuck!

58:29.371 --> 58:32.373
And Kristin Meeken, I had her
at my house today, man.

58:37.579 --> 58:39.413
You talk to her now?

58:39.415 --> 58:42.416
Uh, no, she's
my real estate agent, so...

58:43.685 --> 58:45.553
It's been...

58:45.555 --> 58:48.456
To talk to her and watch her
online, I know, you know...

58:48.458 --> 58:51.225
She sells real estate,
so I thought...

58:51.227 --> 58:53.794
I'll contact her,
and she can sell Nona's house.

58:54.429 --> 58:56.564
And then...
And then...

58:57.032 --> 58:58.666
I can...

58:59.601 --> 59:01.235
I don't know,
I thought that, you know,

59:01.237 --> 59:03.471
if she sold the house
that then maybe we could...

59:03.473 --> 59:05.573
Man, I don't even know
what the fuck I was thinking.

59:06.174 --> 59:08.242
I'm fucking so stupid.

59:15.551 --> 59:16.884
You know...

59:18.987 --> 59:20.388
You ready to go?

59:21.223 --> 59:22.723
Let's go in.

59:22.725 --> 59:24.559
- In there?
- Yeah.

59:24.561 --> 59:27.562
- You want to?
- Yeah, that's why we came here. Let's go.

59:51.954 --> 59:54.922
I don't know, man.
I might pass on this.

59:56.024 --> 59:58.292
Now, come on, man.
You're just freaking out.

01:00:20.916 --> 01:00:22.717
It's crazy.

01:00:29.891 --> 01:00:33.327
Was it this far, man? I don't
remember it being this far.

01:00:41.103 --> 01:00:42.670
Yeah, go.

01:00:43.905 --> 01:00:45.506
Shit.

01:00:59.287 --> 01:01:01.355
Oh, shit.

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:03.591
Here, light the ones
above your head.

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:04.725
All right.

01:01:05.460 --> 01:01:07.828
Yeah, man. I still...

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:10.731
I'll still come here
once in a while, you know.

01:01:10.733 --> 01:01:11.966
Yeah, man.

01:01:11.968 --> 01:01:15.903
Our little spot.
If I can't handle the shit...

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:20.041
Yeah. I say, take an emotional
break, come down here,

01:01:20.043 --> 01:01:22.877
and re-orient and center myself.

01:01:22.879 --> 01:01:24.912
Dude, this is unbelievable.

01:01:24.914 --> 01:01:26.714
- You want?
- Yeah, please.

01:01:33.422 --> 01:01:35.456
Let me feel for a second.

01:01:36.925 --> 01:01:40.061
Let's see if this jogs your
fucking memory a little bit.

01:01:52.607 --> 01:01:53.808
Don...

01:01:59.448 --> 01:02:01.882
You think this is
a fucking joke?

01:02:01.884 --> 01:02:04.885
I brought you down here
for a fucking reason.

01:02:09.725 --> 01:02:12.927
To meet the fucking grim reaper
face to face

01:02:12.929 --> 01:02:16.697
and say, "can I have
fucking forgiveness?"

01:02:25.907 --> 01:02:28.876
I couldn't get rid of it,
I had to hold on to it.

01:02:29.878 --> 01:02:31.312
Yeah, there you go.

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:33.013
It still fucking works, man.

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:34.248
Yeah, you still got it.

01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:38.285
Don't even look at me, don't look at me.
I said, don't look at me.

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:40.688
Officer, I didn't do it,
I swear to god.

01:02:40.690 --> 01:02:42.456
I swear to fucking god,
don't do it.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.626
Now, dude, that was
fucking chill, dude,

01:02:45.628 --> 01:02:48.195
you looked so fucking chill
when you just did that.

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:49.363
Do that again?

01:02:49.365 --> 01:02:51.632
- Do that again. Blow on it.
- What just now I did?

01:02:51.634 --> 01:02:53.467
Yeah, just blow the smoke
off the barrel.

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:55.069
Yeah, there it is.

01:02:55.071 --> 01:02:57.171
- That's right.
- Yeah.

01:02:57.173 --> 01:02:58.939
You want to go to the movies?

01:02:58.941 --> 01:03:00.407
- Today?
- Yeah, now.

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:02.476
- I thought you had to go back?
- No.

01:03:03.145 --> 01:03:05.045
Yeah. Yeah, fuck.

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:07.615
I'm going back tomorrow morning. Let's
do that. Let's go to the movies.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.450
All right, yeah, cool.

01:03:13.722 --> 01:03:17.491
<i>Hey, Peter it's just your friendly
real estate agent calling.</i>

01:03:17.493 --> 01:03:19.426
I just have a couple questions
about the house.

01:03:19.428 --> 01:03:22.429
<i>I don't know if you're around
tonight, if you want to hang out.</i>

01:03:22.431 --> 01:03:26.200
<i>I'm just kidding. Oh, god, I'm so sorry.
Just give me a call back, all right.</i>

01:03:32.073 --> 01:03:33.507
Hey, don.

01:03:34.176 --> 01:03:36.544
Hey, what do you want to get?

01:03:37.312 --> 01:03:39.013
Uh...

01:03:39.015 --> 01:03:42.049
Pete, I'm not going to pay the theater
prices, so pick something out.

01:03:42.051 --> 01:03:45.286
I don't know if you're in the mood
for something sweet or savory,

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:46.821
or something more salty.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:49.723
- I don't want...
- I'll have whatever you're having.

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.258
No, that's what
I don't want to happen!

01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.761
I don't want you digging into
my munchies during the theater.

01:03:53.763 --> 01:03:55.362
I want you to pick
something out yourself.

01:03:55.364 --> 01:03:57.431
I'm really not hungry. We can
get something afterwards.

01:03:57.433 --> 01:04:00.267
Yeah, you say that now, but I know for
a fact when we're in the theater,

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:01.735
you're gonna be digging
into my munchies.

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:04.338
Listen, I got to make a phone call, okay?
I'll be right outside.

01:04:04.340 --> 01:04:05.739
Who are you calling?

01:04:05.741 --> 01:04:06.473
Co-worker.

01:04:06.475 --> 01:04:08.275
- Huh?
- Someone from work.

01:04:08.277 --> 01:04:11.946
All right, well, you better just not
eat my stuff, so, that's your choice.

01:04:13.114 --> 01:04:16.083
What? What do you mean?
You weren't being insensitive.

01:04:16.085 --> 01:04:18.485
<i>I don't know, I just feel
like I was being weird.</i>

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:20.487
No! No, no, no,
I was being weird,

01:04:20.489 --> 01:04:22.756
I'm sorry,
I was like, you know...

01:04:22.758 --> 01:04:25.192
It's just my head was in another
place, sorry, I apologize.

01:04:25.194 --> 01:04:29.129
<i>- Okay. Okay, good. I just
wanted to make sure.</i> - Okay.

01:04:29.131 --> 01:04:31.165
<i>So what are you doing now?</i>

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.466
Nothing. What are you doing?

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:34.702
Uh, I don't know, do you maybe
want to hang out?

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:37.238
Yeah, yeah.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.973
What do you want to do?

01:04:38.975 --> 01:04:42.243
<i>Well, I have this super weird
thing I have to go to.</i>

01:04:42.245 --> 01:04:44.278
<i>It's got an open bar, but...</i>

01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.947
All right. Yeah. I don't care,
that sounds cool. Let's do that.

01:04:46.949 --> 01:04:50.885
<i>Okay, yeah, it's a benefit.
So lets go to the bar there.</i>

01:04:50.887 --> 01:04:53.587
Yeah, that's perfect. Do you want
to just text me the address?

01:04:53.589 --> 01:04:56.423
<i>Yes! Okay,
I'll see you there.</i>

01:04:56.425 --> 01:04:58.826
All right, okay, sounds good.
Do that, bye.

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:00.194
<i>Bye!</i>

01:05:01.062 --> 01:05:02.663
I got you runts.

01:05:03.265 --> 01:05:04.965
Nice!

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:09.103
Yeah, I just knew you were gonna be
munching hard once we got in there.

01:05:09.105 --> 01:05:09.937
Nice.

01:05:09.939 --> 01:05:11.438
Is everything all set,
can we go?

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:15.075
Yeah, uh, listen,
I just talked to, uh...

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:16.277
Kristin Meken.

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:17.578
All right.

01:05:18.113 --> 01:05:19.446
She wants to hang out.

01:05:19.448 --> 01:05:20.581
So...

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.149
Like, go to the movies with us?

01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:24.485
No, like, she wants to go on a date.
She wants to get a drink.

01:05:24.487 --> 01:05:26.086
So, I...

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:27.321
Like, the three of us?

01:05:27.923 --> 01:05:30.658
No, just, uh, me.

01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:32.726
So you don't want
to go to the movies?

01:05:33.295 --> 01:05:35.863
Not tonight. All right?

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:38.832
But I really want to.
Okay? And we will.

01:05:38.834 --> 01:05:41.468
But if you could just give me
a ride over to, uh,

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:42.937
Benedict, that'd be
really sweet.

01:05:44.439 --> 01:05:46.874
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:05:46.876 --> 01:05:49.410
- Donald. - I'm not fucking going
to the movies by myself, so...

01:05:49.412 --> 01:05:50.678
Donald!

01:05:50.680 --> 01:05:53.414
Let's go if you wanna go,
you asked me to do this.

01:05:53.416 --> 01:05:55.816
Come on, man. It's fucking
Kristin, like, like...

01:05:55.818 --> 01:05:58.419
I don't give a fuck
whoever the fuck it is.

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:00.187
These were plans
you wanted to do.

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:01.822
I'm sorry, dude...

01:06:01.824 --> 01:06:04.725
I'm not fucking going to go to the
movies by myself, so let's fucking go.

01:06:04.727 --> 01:06:08.228
This was just something
that <i>you</i> said you want to do.

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:19.707
I'm going to see a movie with you at
some point, I promise you, I promise...

01:06:38.793 --> 01:06:42.663
don, I'm sorry, man, I just...

01:06:44.232 --> 01:06:45.766
You understand.

01:06:46.368 --> 01:06:47.668
Right?

01:06:54.009 --> 01:06:55.209
Don?

01:06:56.111 --> 01:06:58.212
You think I could actually
get that 20 bucks?

01:07:00.715 --> 01:07:02.216
That'd be really sweet.

01:07:08.957 --> 01:07:11.258
Don, I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

01:07:13.461 --> 01:07:15.129
I'll see you, pal.

01:07:30.912 --> 01:07:32.846
Hey.

01:07:32.848 --> 01:07:34.548
Thanks for coming!

01:07:34.550 --> 01:07:36.550
Oh, my gosh! You're here.

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.187
Oh, wow! Wow, wow, wow.

01:07:40.189 --> 01:07:44.992
I've got a lot of things
going on here. I got that.

01:07:49.364 --> 01:07:51.065
So, what do you want to drink?

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:52.399
Um...

01:07:54.269 --> 01:07:56.437
All right, I have
a little confession, okay?

01:07:57.205 --> 01:07:59.740
I... lost my wallet.

01:07:59.742 --> 01:08:02.276
- Oh, my, that sucks!
- I feel pathetic, I know.

01:08:02.278 --> 01:08:04.378
Well, don't worry,
I got you covered.

01:08:06.214 --> 01:08:07.581
- Really?
- Yes.

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:09.883
All right, all right.

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:11.952
- What do you like to drink?
- Just a beer.

01:08:14.289 --> 01:08:16.290
What... wow! Wow!

01:08:20.694 --> 01:08:23.063
- I'd look like a drunk.
- No, you don't.

01:08:23.064 --> 01:08:25.064
Is this normal?
Is this normal here?

01:08:25.067 --> 01:08:28.035
I mean, I've already
had three, so, you know...

01:09:15.617 --> 01:09:19.286
I saw on Facebook that you're
very active in your business...

01:09:19.287 --> 01:09:22.756
- oh, wait, you've been following
me on Facebook? - Well, I just...

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:25.692
wait, you just pretended
that you didn't know me!

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:29.162
You know, you remember me
from, you do remember me...

01:09:29.165 --> 01:09:30.631
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, listen...

01:09:30.633 --> 01:09:32.166
So you do remember me?

01:09:33.501 --> 01:09:36.603
I just can't believe you're not
wearing eyeliner anymore.

01:09:38.706 --> 01:09:40.340
Yeah, you know...

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:41.475
- Yeah.
- That's good.

01:09:41.477 --> 01:09:43.010
I'm glad for you.

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:44.745
I'm really glad for me too.

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:46.947
- Are you still listening to heavy metal?
- No.

01:10:17.579 --> 01:10:19.913
I'm getting lost in these.

01:10:23.051 --> 01:10:25.285
No, keep it coming.
Keep it coming.

01:10:25.287 --> 01:10:26.153
Keep it coming?

01:10:26.155 --> 01:10:28.922
Yeah, you're getting lost in...

01:10:33.628 --> 01:10:35.195
We should probably go somewhere.

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:37.064
Where do we go?
Where do you wanna go?

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:39.633
Uh, anywhere, but here.

01:10:39.635 --> 01:10:42.002
Why? Is this bad?
Is this dangerous?

01:10:45.106 --> 01:10:46.974
Yeah, be careful. Come on,

why don't you
just fuck me in the kitchen?

01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.714
Where they prepare the food!

01:12:39.354 --> 01:12:41.121
There's somebody at the door.

01:12:41.123 --> 01:12:44.091
There's somebody standing
at the door!

01:12:46.761 --> 01:12:48.161
- Donald?
- Yeah.

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:50.163
- What are you doing, man?
- Yeah, you got room for three?

01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:51.798
Eww, do you know him?

01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:53.367
Hey, Donald, stop it.

01:12:53.369 --> 01:12:55.569
- You did it.
- Donald, stop.

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:58.171
Congratulations, man.
Congratulations.

01:12:58.173 --> 01:12:59.339
Please, not now...

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:00.841
I just had to
tell you something.

01:13:00.843 --> 01:13:01.908
Okay, what? What?

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:03.210
Who is this guy?

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:05.245
- I'm his best friend.
- What do you want, Donald?

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:07.147
He was talking about fucking
you all night and all day.

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:09.316
- Excuse me! Don't talk to me like that.
- What do you want?

01:13:09.318 --> 01:13:10.317
Brother, you did it.

01:13:10.319 --> 01:13:12.119
Okay, I'm just gonna
go sit back down.

01:13:12.121 --> 01:13:13.387
Donald, stop.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:15.088
You're not going
to wanna see this.

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:17.357
Well, you sound retarded.

01:13:18.893 --> 01:13:20.560
Go home, man!

01:13:22.563 --> 01:13:24.131
Fuck off!

01:13:31.739 --> 01:13:34.741
It's really great to see how many
of you have come out to support us.

01:13:35.977 --> 01:13:38.845
It really does mean a lot to me.

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:40.580
Uh, and especially, Jane,

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:43.150
who wanted so badly
to be here tonight.

01:13:44.485 --> 01:13:46.186
So, yeah, we, uh...

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:49.089
We thank you from the bottom
of our hearts, so thank you.

01:13:49.091 --> 01:13:50.557
I'm so sorry about that.

01:13:50.559 --> 01:13:51.725
That was really weird.

01:13:51.727 --> 01:13:53.794
I know it was. I know.

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:55.362
- It was really weird.
- I know.

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:56.963
- He's fucked up.
- Dear god.

01:13:56.965 --> 01:13:59.199
Hey, listen, can we just go?

01:13:59.201 --> 01:14:01.835
No, I don't want
to talk to you, please. Okay.

01:14:01.837 --> 01:14:03.270
Please. Hey...

01:14:03.272 --> 01:14:05.305
- Hey, can you just look at me?
- I'm not... I'm not...

01:14:05.307 --> 01:14:08.675
I'm embarrassed enough, I don't want to
be involved in that kind of weirdness.

01:14:08.677 --> 01:14:10.477
Pete, hey.

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:13.413
I just want to talk to you for a
second, I'm sorry about that.

01:14:13.415 --> 01:14:14.781
I didn't want to
interrupt you guys.

01:14:14.783 --> 01:14:17.017
I didn't want to interrupt
you hooking up with him,

01:14:17.019 --> 01:14:18.218
- I really didn't.
- Guys.

01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:19.519
- Wait.
- Guys.

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:22.289
We're fine, buddy. We're fine.
Take it easy.

01:14:22.291 --> 01:14:24.357
Please, Pete,
just talk to me for a second.

01:14:24.359 --> 01:14:25.959
I didn't want to
fuck that up for you.

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:27.427
I swear to god, I didn't.

01:14:27.429 --> 01:14:29.396
Please just talk
to me for a second.

01:14:29.398 --> 01:14:31.131
Can you look at me, please?

01:14:31.133 --> 01:14:32.766
Can you please look
at me for a second?

01:14:32.768 --> 01:14:35.502
Pete, I want you to fucking
look at me for a second.

01:14:35.504 --> 01:14:38.905
I want you to
fucking respect me!

01:14:46.814 --> 01:14:48.682
Hey, guys, whoa,
whoa, whoa whoa!

01:14:48.684 --> 01:14:49.950
Get the fuck off me!

01:14:49.952 --> 01:14:52.018
Dude, what the fuck? This is
my wife's cancer benefit.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.720
I don't give a fuck!

01:15:46.741 --> 01:15:48.675
Look who it is.

01:15:49.710 --> 01:15:51.144
Hi, Mrs. Treebeck.

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:52.879
Peter!

01:15:52.881 --> 01:15:54.281
Oh...

01:15:56.150 --> 01:15:58.351
Look at... oh!

01:15:58.353 --> 01:16:00.554
- I got to get you some ice.
- It's okay, I'm good.

01:16:00.556 --> 01:16:01.888
Look at you.

01:16:03.958 --> 01:16:06.226
What happened to
my little boys, huh?

01:16:06.228 --> 01:16:07.694
You want eggs?

01:16:08.896 --> 01:16:10.297
Sure.

01:16:11.933 --> 01:16:15.802
Oh, hey, I'm sorry to hear
about your grandmother.

01:16:15.804 --> 01:16:18.104
Oh, thanks, I appreciate that.

01:16:18.106 --> 01:16:21.007
Yeah, she was,
she was a awesome lady.

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:23.810
That she was.

01:16:25.212 --> 01:16:26.646
The homos are up.

01:16:28.082 --> 01:16:29.916
How many fingers do I got?

01:16:32.186 --> 01:16:33.687
Karen, what are you doing?

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:34.888
You eating or what?

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:38.258
Yeah, no, no, I had something
earlier, I'm good?

01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.826
Grab me a drink.

01:16:39.828 --> 01:16:41.595
I'll get it.
What do you want?

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:42.963
Coffee.

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:43.964
You don't want juice?

01:16:43.966 --> 01:16:45.699
No, coffee.

01:16:49.937 --> 01:16:51.438
How's your face?

01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:54.040
Fine.

01:16:54.042 --> 01:16:56.042
If I was you...

01:16:56.044 --> 01:16:57.844
I'd be shitting
my pants right now.

01:16:59.614 --> 01:17:01.982
Donald could have had
gay sex with you last night.

01:17:02.950 --> 01:17:03.984
Stop it.

01:17:06.487 --> 01:17:09.189
I just hope if he did,

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:11.491
it was safe sex. I don't want
fucking aids in this house.

01:17:11.493 --> 01:17:13.727
Oh, don't be gross.

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:16.596
Donald and Peter were
best friends growing up.

01:17:16.598 --> 01:17:17.697
No shit.

01:17:18.599 --> 01:17:20.400
You had friends growing up?

01:17:22.236 --> 01:17:23.803
I'm sorry to hear that.

01:17:26.073 --> 01:17:27.974
I said, I'm sorry to hear that!

01:17:30.411 --> 01:17:32.646
Baby, he knows
what I'm talking about.

01:17:32.648 --> 01:17:35.448
But he's not saying nothing,
like Bambi with the headlights.

01:17:37.084 --> 01:17:38.685
Welcome to my world.

01:17:40.388 --> 01:17:41.855
Give me the b12.

01:17:41.857 --> 01:17:44.591
On the weetabix, you know, the
stuff that gives me the anxiety.

01:17:44.593 --> 01:17:47.494
I gotta do lats later, I want
to fucking get a full set.

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:50.397
Could you, like, put your arms
around each other now?

01:17:50.865 --> 01:17:52.232
Yeah! Okay.

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:54.567
All right. Okay, smile...

01:17:55.436 --> 01:17:57.837
Good. Wait, Donald, smile...

01:17:58.572 --> 01:18:01.041
Oh, yeah! That's nice.

01:18:01.043 --> 01:18:02.075
That's nice.

01:18:04.312 --> 01:18:07.213
Did you take it?
I don't think you took it.

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:08.715
It didn't...

01:18:09.617 --> 01:18:11.384
All right, let me see it
for a second.

01:18:11.386 --> 01:18:13.553
Can we just get this over with?

01:18:17.859 --> 01:18:21.327
All right, here you go,
you got to hold it down.

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:23.096
Now, let's get this.

01:18:24.999 --> 01:18:26.900
Okay, smile.

01:18:34.341 --> 01:18:35.608
Jesus Christ, mom.

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:38.511
We'll get the fucking
picture later. Let's go.

01:18:46.954 --> 01:18:48.421
Where's your dad?

01:18:49.256 --> 01:18:50.790
He passed away.

01:18:52.927 --> 01:18:53.927
When?

01:18:53.929 --> 01:18:55.128
Right after high school.

01:18:56.197 --> 01:18:57.897
Jesus.

01:18:57.899 --> 01:18:59.566
I'm sorry, man. What...

01:19:01.135 --> 01:19:02.235
What happened to him?

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:03.903
Uh, cancer.

01:19:12.346 --> 01:19:14.447
And that guy
is your mother's boyfriend now?

01:19:14.449 --> 01:19:16.182
Yeah... no, husband.

01:19:17.384 --> 01:19:20.086
Yeah. I know you don't
like him, but...

01:19:20.788 --> 01:19:22.322
He's fine, man.

01:19:22.324 --> 01:19:25.125
He treats my mom good, so...

01:19:25.127 --> 01:19:26.893
That's all that matters to me.

01:19:29.530 --> 01:19:31.164
I'm sorry, Donald.

01:19:31.166 --> 01:19:34.834
- No, that's fine, man. I mean...
- Your dad was awesome.

01:19:34.836 --> 01:19:35.935
Awesome.

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:39.205
I know, but now he's up there
fucking kicking it

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:41.207
with fucking Nona.

01:19:41.209 --> 01:19:43.109
He's kicking it with your folks.

01:19:44.145 --> 01:19:45.245
Man...

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:48.014
I wanna say it too, like,

01:19:48.016 --> 01:19:51.317
I'm really fucking sorry
about last night.

01:19:51.319 --> 01:19:53.987
Don't worry about it, we're even.
That was a ridiculous night.

01:19:53.989 --> 01:19:56.156
I mean, I was
completely intoxicated.

01:19:56.158 --> 01:19:57.690
I was too.

01:19:57.692 --> 01:20:00.994
My body was so
saturated with alcohol

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:05.965
that I think my brain completely
shut down at one point.

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.300
That sounds about right.

01:20:07.302 --> 01:20:09.936
And just...
I was on cruise control.

01:20:09.938 --> 01:20:12.839
When I walked in you were really
grinding on her pretty good.

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:15.842
Yeah, it was going well. It was
going really well actually.

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:18.211
Yeah, and I was just like,
so disappointed at myself.

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:22.515
I was like, "why would you go and
fucking cock block your bro like that?"

01:20:22.517 --> 01:20:26.753
I don't want... I don't want to be
known as somebody who cock blocks.

01:20:26.755 --> 01:20:29.355
Yeah, kind of exactly
what it was.

01:20:29.357 --> 01:20:34.327
It went from a hard dick to
getting knocked out cold, so...

01:20:34.329 --> 01:20:37.630
That too is something else
I'm disappointed in, I mean,

01:20:37.632 --> 01:20:40.900
you were in absolute beast mode.

01:20:40.902 --> 01:20:43.837
You fucking knocked me down,
I was out of position,

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:45.705
I wanted to take
that blow for you.

01:20:45.707 --> 01:20:48.575
I wanted to absorb that shot,
but I just couldn't get there.

01:20:48.577 --> 01:20:51.845
And that guy, he fucking had
nice fucking swing.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:53.780
- He really did.
- I mean, it was nice, yeah.

01:20:53.782 --> 01:20:56.683
He connected,
right with the kill shot,

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.718
right in the sweet spot, yeah.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:00.687
And, I mean, you went down
like that.

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.589
I thought you died.

01:21:04.725 --> 01:21:08.261
It seemed like a nice event
though from what I gathered.

01:21:13.734 --> 01:21:16.603
Just remembered I have
something for you.

01:21:17.538 --> 01:21:19.572
I was able to, uh...

01:21:20.241 --> 01:21:21.274
Just...

01:21:22.209 --> 01:21:23.776
Save a little bit of this.

01:21:25.379 --> 01:21:26.813
- Oh.
- Nona.

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:28.514
All right. So... thank you.

01:21:28.516 --> 01:21:30.216
You know, if you want
put it back in the bag.

01:21:30.218 --> 01:21:31.517
Yeah, maybe I will.

01:21:31.519 --> 01:21:32.752
All right.

01:21:33.821 --> 01:21:35.855
- Guess I'll just...
- Yeah.

01:21:39.994 --> 01:21:42.795
- This is it.
- This is it, man, it's been good.

01:21:43.664 --> 01:21:45.098
It was great to
see you, you know.

01:21:45.100 --> 01:21:47.166
Yeah, it was great
to see you too, don.

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:51.104
And just know, like, if you're
ever back around, you know...

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:54.307
I don't know when I'll be back
up here, but I'll obviously...

01:21:56.677 --> 01:21:58.878
- You know?
- Yeah.

01:21:58.880 --> 01:22:00.513
And if you ever
come to the city...

01:22:00.515 --> 01:22:01.581
- Nah.

01:22:03.451 --> 01:22:05.018
You know that.

I don't like talking much if...

01:22:26.207 --> 01:22:27.573
Do you know how to text?

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:29.142
- Yeah.
- Yeah, so...

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:30.677
I'm not a big phone guy.

01:22:38.986 --> 01:22:40.186
Hello?

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:41.321

- All right.

01:22:54.436 --> 01:22:57.303
This is not going like I hoped.

01:22:59.573 --> 01:23:01.207
I really miss you.

01:23:01.209 --> 01:23:06.245

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:18.257
No, no, I'm good. I got it.

01:23:18.259 --> 01:23:19.759
