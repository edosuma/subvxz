TO EAT THIS WHOLE THING...

11:01.193 --> 11:03.129
RIGHT NOW.

11:06.332 --> 11:07.700
[all gasp]

11:07.900 --> 11:09.168
- [sobbing]

11:09.368 --> 11:11.337
I'LL MISS HIM SO MUCH.

11:16.208 --> 11:17.276
- WOW.

11:17.476 --> 11:18.544
THIS IS...

11:18.744 --> 11:19.712
TOTALLY...

11:19.912 --> 11:20.880
AWESOME!

11:21.080 --> 11:22.048
all: HUH?

11:25.985 --> 11:29.622
- THIS SQUID SURPRISE
IS SURPRISINGLY DELICIOUS.

11:29.822 --> 11:32.324
WE HAVE A WINNER.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.793
[cheers and applause]

11:33.993 --> 11:35.394
- OH, THANKS.

11:35.594 --> 11:37.596
BUT THE BEST PRIZE IS KNOWING

11:37.797 --> 11:40.466
THAT YOU AND YOUR FATHER
REALLY DO LOVE MY COOKING.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.601
WAIT.

11:42.802 --> 11:44.804
WHERE IS YOUR FATHER?

11:45.004 --> 11:47.139
- NOW I AM THE ALPHA LOAF!

11:49.708 --> 11:52.344
MEAT LOAVES, FOLLOW ME
TO DINKLEBERG'S HOUSE.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.713
BUT FIRST LET'S FROLIC
IN THE SAUSAGE FIELDS!

11:54.914 --> 11:58.617
OOH, I FEEL SO GREASY!

12:17.169 --> 12:18.237
[doorbell rings]
[knocking at door]

12:19.972 --> 12:21.340
DOUG DIMMADOME?

12:21.540 --> 12:23.442
- CONGRATULATIONS, TIMMY TURNER.

12:23.642 --> 12:25.344
YOU AND YOUR PARENTS
ARE THE LUCKY WINNERS

12:25.544 --> 12:27.480
OF MY FIRST FAMILY IN SPACE
CONTEST.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.382
YOU'RE GOING ON A GENUINE
OUTER SPACE ADVENTURE.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.451
- THAT'S WEIRD.

12:32.651 --> 12:34.720
WE NEVER ENTERED
A FIRST FAMILY IN SPACE CONTEST.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.856
- I KNOW; YOUR NAME
WAS RANDOMLY PICKED FROM A HAT

12:37.056 --> 12:38.457
BY A CIRCUS MONKEY.

12:38.657 --> 12:40.126
HE ALSO PICKED OUT MY OUTFIT.

12:40.326 --> 12:40.826
HERE'S THE KEY.

12:44.330 --> 12:45.097
beep!

12:47.333 --> 12:50.069
ENJOY YOUR SPACE RIDE.

12:50.269 --> 12:52.138
- WHAT'S GOING ON, TIMMY?

12:52.338 --> 12:54.273
- UH, A MONKEY PICKED US
TO GO TO OUTER SPACE.

12:54.473 --> 12:55.841
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.710
WE'RE GOING TO OUTER SPACE?

12:57.910 --> 12:59.478
[screams with delight]

12:59.678 --> 13:01.113
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

13:01.313 --> 13:02.615
TIMMY'S HOLDING A SET OF KEYS!

13:02.815 --> 13:05.384
YEAH!

13:05.584 --> 13:08.287
- SPORT, MAYBE YOU SHOULDN'T
TAKE YOUR FAMILY INTO SPACE.

13:08.487 --> 13:10.089
DON'T YOU REMEMBER?

13:10.289 --> 13:12.191
DARK LASER VOWED
TO ANNIHILATE YOU

13:12.391 --> 13:14.193
AFTER YOU BLEW UP
HIS DEATH BALL.

13:14.393 --> 13:16.295
- FOR, LIKE,
THE ELEVENTEENTH TIME.

13:16.495 --> 13:17.763
- YEAH,
YOU GUYS DO HAVE A POINT.

13:23.569 --> 13:25.704
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT SO SURE
WE SHOULD GO INTO SPACE

13:25.905 --> 13:28.507
JUST 'CAUSE A CIRCUS MONKEY
PICKED OUR NAME FROM A HAT.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.643
- THAT'S EXACTLY WHY
WE SHOULD GO.

13:30.843 --> 13:32.778
MONKEYS ARE NEVER WRONG
ABOUT SPACE TRAVEL.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.313
YEH!

13:34.513 --> 13:35.848
WE'RE HEADING FOR THE SUN.

13:36.048 --> 13:36.382
WE GOT A DEFECTIVE MONKEY!

13:38.918 --> 13:40.686
- WE'RE BREAKING UP.

13:40.886 --> 13:42.888
WE NEED TO JETTISON
THE EXTRA WEIGHT.

13:43.088 --> 13:45.257
- UH, BOWLING BALLS, BARBELLS,
MY SUIT OF ARMOR.

13:45.457 --> 13:47.359
TIMMY'S FISH!

13:47.560 --> 13:49.495
[OddParents scream]

13:49.695 --> 13:51.664
- AH! YOU COULDN'T HAVE
THROWN OUT THE BARBELLS?

13:51.864 --> 13:53.165
- THEY'RE YOUR MOTHER'S, TIMMY.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.434
I CAN'T EVEN LIFT THEM.

13:55.634 --> 13:57.636
[all screaming]

14:08.681 --> 14:10.616
- OOF!

14:10.816 --> 14:12.051
- DOUG DIMMADOME?

14:12.251 --> 14:14.253
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

14:14.453 --> 14:16.021
- I AIN'T HERE,
BECAUSE I'M NOT DOUG DIMMADOME.

14:16.222 --> 14:18.224
I AM DARK LASER.

14:18.424 --> 14:20.492
AND YOU, TIMMY TURNER,
HAVE FALLEN FOR THE OLD

14:20.693 --> 14:22.494
"CIRCUS MONKEY PICKED YOUR NAME
FROM A HAT

14:22.695 --> 14:24.463
TO WIN A TRIP TO SPACE CONTEST"
TRICK.

14:24.663 --> 14:26.565
[laughs incoherently]
OUTER SPACE!

14:26.765 --> 14:28.300
- TIMMY, AREN'T YOU GOING
TO INTRODUCE US

14:28.500 --> 14:30.402
TO YOUR SCARY FRIEND?

14:30.603 --> 14:32.871
- HE'S NOT MY FRIEND;
HE'S AN EVIL ALIEN.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.140
HE'S OUT TO GET ME, BECAUSE
I DESTROYED HIS DEATH BALL.

14:35.341 --> 14:37.209
- LIKE ELEVENTEEN TIMES.

14:37.409 --> 14:38.510
GUARDS, LOCK THEM UP.

14:42.748 --> 14:45.818
- OOH! ARE YOU TAKING US
TO THE ZOO?

14:46.018 --> 14:47.953
- NO, I'M PUTTING YOU
IN THE ZOO.

14:48.153 --> 14:50.422
YOU SEE, AFTER YOUR SON
DESTROYED MY DEATH BALL,

14:50.623 --> 14:52.992
I BUILT THIS ALIEN ZOO
TO RAISE MONEY FOR REPAIRS.

14:53.192 --> 14:55.861
YOU TURNERS WILL BE
MY HUMAN EXHIBIT,

14:56.061 --> 14:58.163
NOT TO MENTION
MY STAR ATTRACTION.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.132
- YOU BUILT A ZOO?

15:00.332 --> 15:01.900
THAT'S, LIKE,
THE LAMEST PLAN EVER.

15:02.101 --> 15:03.869
- LAME?
I DON'T THINK SO.

15:04.069 --> 15:05.204
BECAUSE I ALSO BUILT...

15:05.404 --> 15:07.373
A MALL.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.808
[laughs]

15:10.009 --> 15:11.977
IT'S ANOTHER CLEVER
MONEY-MAKING SCHEME.

15:12.177 --> 15:14.546
I CALL IT "THE DEATH MALL
ON THE DEATH BALL."

15:14.747 --> 15:16.448
IT WAS BUILT BY MY FRIEND SAUL
LAST FALL.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.550
HE'S TALL.
I SHOULD GIVE HIM A CALL.

15:23.656 --> 15:24.890
- [chattering]

15:25.090 --> 15:27.359
- [roaring]

15:27.559 --> 15:29.561
- THIS IS THE HIDEOUSLY
UNPLEASANT HABITAT

15:29.762 --> 15:32.398
WHERE YOU WILL LIVE
LIKE CAGED ANIMALS.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.967
- IT LOOKS JUST LIKE OUR HOUSE
ON EARTH.

15:35.167 --> 15:37.836
- YES, BUT WITH A FEW
HORRIFYING ADDITIONS,

15:38.037 --> 15:41.040
LIKE A METEOR ROOM
WITH A BIG-SCREEN TV.

15:41.240 --> 15:43.309
both: NO!

15:45.611 --> 15:46.912
- WHAT?
YOU DON'T FIND THAT TERRIFYING?

15:49.748 --> 15:52.918
- UH, OF COURSE WE DO,
MR. DARK LASER.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.386
I JUST HOPE YOU DON'T GIVE ME
A MINI FRIDGE

15:54.586 --> 15:55.988
FULL OF CHERRY SODAS.

15:56.188 --> 15:57.823
OH, THAT WOULD BE UNBEARABLE.

15:58.023 --> 15:59.958
- REALLY?

16:00.159 --> 16:01.360
GUARDS, BRING IN THE MINI FRIDGE
AND CHERRY SODAS.

16:01.560 --> 16:03.662
[laughs]

16:03.862 --> 16:05.731
- I THINK I'M GOING TO LIKE
LIVING LIKE A CAGED ANIMAL.

16:10.736 --> 16:13.372
- TURNER, I NEED 100,000 BILLION
DEATH DOLLARS

16:13.572 --> 16:15.674
TO REPAIR MY DEATH BALL.

16:15.874 --> 16:20.145
AND ONCE I GET IT, I WILL
ANNIHILATE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

16:20.346 --> 16:22.748
beep!

16:22.948 --> 16:24.950
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
THE DEATH BALL ZOO

16:25.150 --> 16:27.886
IS PROUD TO PRESENT
OUR BRAND-NEW HUMAN HABITAT.

16:28.087 --> 16:29.388
AND THERE'S A SALE
ON WOOKIEE MEAT

16:29.588 --> 16:31.223
AT THE SLAUGHTERY BARN.

16:31.423 --> 16:32.024
[laughs]
SALE ON WOOKIEE MEAT!

16:33.959 --> 16:35.060
[dinging]

16:40.232 --> 16:41.633
PLEASE DON'T FEED THE TURNERS.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.239
- OH, NO.

16:47.439 --> 16:48.640
COSMO, WANDA, WHERE ARE YOU?

16:51.610 --> 16:54.079
- OH, NO, IT'S THE DEATH BALL.

16:54.279 --> 16:56.582
COSMO, DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

16:56.782 --> 16:59.418
- IT MEANS DOUG DIMMADOME WAS
REALLY DARK LASER IN DISGUISE

16:59.618 --> 17:01.220
AND THE CONTEST WAS JUST A TRICK
TO CAPTURE TIMMY.

17:01.420 --> 17:02.521
DUH!

17:02.721 --> 17:04.623
- WOW, COSMO.

17:04.823 --> 17:05.958
THAT'S SO NOT LIKE YOU
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

17:06.157 --> 17:07.925
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.528
THAT MUST MEAN
I'M NOT REALLY COSMO.

17:09.728 --> 17:10.796
I BETTER PULL OFF THIS DISGUISE.

17:13.665 --> 17:16.234
WOW, WHOEVER I AM,
I USED A LOT OF GLUE.

17:16.435 --> 17:19.238
- WE HAVE TO GET
TO THE DEATH BALL.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.173
NOW TO SAVE TIMMY.

17:21.373 --> 17:23.642
WAIT A MINUTE;
WE'RE IN A MALL?

17:23.842 --> 17:27.012
- YEAH, OOH, AND THERE'S A SALE
AT DEAD, BATH, AND BEYOND.

17:27.212 --> 17:28.446
- COSMO, HOW CAN YOU THINK
OF SHOPPING

17:28.647 --> 17:30.048
AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

17:30.249 --> 17:32.217
WOW, THERE'S A DOOMINGDALE'S.

17:32.418 --> 17:34.019
I'LL MEET YOU AT DEMON MARCUS
IN TEN MINUTES.

17:34.219 --> 17:36.388
THEN WE'LL SAVE TIMMY.

17:36.588 --> 17:38.490
- MY PLAN IS WORKING PERFECTLY,
TURNER.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.826
PEOPLE ARE PAYING ME
BILLIONS OF DEATH DOLLARS

17:41.026 --> 17:42.828
JUST TO SEE YOU
AND YOUR PARENTS SUFFER.

17:43.028 --> 17:44.496
- HONEY, HE'S WATCHING.

17:44.696 --> 17:45.998
HAM IT UP.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.667
PLEASE, MR. DARK LASER!

17:48.867 --> 17:51.003
I CAN'T TAKE MUCH MORE OF THIS.

17:51.203 --> 17:53.038
WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T GIVE ME

17:53.238 --> 17:55.507
A HIGH-DEF PREMIUM
SPORTS PACKAGE FOR MY TV!

17:55.707 --> 17:57.609
- AND I BEG YOU,

17:57.810 --> 17:59.178
DON'T GIVE ME A BUTLER
TO SERVE ME A COBB SALAD.

17:59.378 --> 18:00.746
[sobs]

18:00.946 --> 18:02.881
WITH RANCH ON THE SIDE!

18:03.081 --> 18:05.017
- GUARDS, INSTALL
THE HIGH-DEF SPORTS PACKAGE,

18:05.217 --> 18:06.852
AND BRING IN A BUTLER
WITH RANCH ON THE SIDE.

18:07.052 --> 18:09.254
[laughs]
COBB SALAD...TOMATOES!

18:09.455 --> 18:12.424
[upbeat music]

18:12.624 --> 18:15.160

I MEAN, NO!

18:18.163 --> 18:21.333
- HOORAY!
I MEAN, WHY?

18:21.533 --> 18:23.335
- [laughs]

18:23.535 --> 18:24.837
TURNER, THE SCREAMS
OF YOUR PARENTS

18:25.037 --> 18:26.138
ARE MUSIC TO MY EARS.

18:26.338 --> 18:28.207
COME ON, FLIPSY.

18:28.407 --> 18:30.042
I'LL BUY YOU A NEW TOY

18:30.242 --> 18:31.477
ding!

18:31.677 --> 18:33.545

18:33.745 --> 18:35.080

AS SOON AS THAT TOTE BOARD

18:37.249 --> 18:38.617
HITS 100,000 BILLION
DEATH DOLLARS,

18:38.817 --> 18:40.819
HE'S GOING TO ANNIHILATE US.

18:41.019 --> 18:42.821
- OH, TIMMY, WOULD A MAN
WHO'S GOING TO ANNIHILATE US

18:43.021 --> 18:46.391
REALLY GIVE ME THIS CAN
OF FANCY CASHEWS?

18:46.592 --> 18:48.360
- LOOKS LIKE I'M ON MY OWN.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.862
I'M GOING TO DIG
UNDER THIS FORCE FIELD

18:50.062 --> 18:52.431
AND GET US OUT OF HERE.

18:52.631 --> 18:53.866
[electricity crackling]
AH!

STUPID FORCE FIELD!

18:57.069 --> 18:58.203
[cheers and applause]

19:03.675 --> 19:05.077

19:05.277 --> 19:06.912
- COSMO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:07.112 --> 19:08.247
WE SAID WE'D MEET
TEN MINUTES AGO.

19:08.447 --> 19:10.282
- I GOT A JOB.

19:10.482 --> 19:11.750
I'M A FRY COOK HERE
AT HELL ON A STICK.

19:11.950 --> 19:13.852
- COSMO, THAT'S GROSS!

19:14.052 --> 19:15.687
- I KNOW, BUT I EARNED
ENOUGH DEATH DOLLARS

19:15.888 --> 19:17.623
TO TAKE US ALL

19:17.823 --> 19:19.424
I HEAR EVERYONE LOVES
THAT PLACE.

19:19.625 --> 19:20.859

AND STOP LAUGHING AT ME!

19:24.463 --> 19:25.731
[screams]

19:30.836 --> 19:32.571
- WELL, FLIPSY, IT LOOKS LIKE
THE CROWD IS FLIPPING

19:32.771 --> 19:34.406
OVER THE TURNER ATTRACTION.

19:34.606 --> 19:36.074
THAT GIVES ME AN IDEA.

19:36.275 --> 19:38.010
I'LL USE TURNER'S POPULARITY

19:38.210 --> 19:39.845
TO MAKE THE MONEY I NEED
EVEN FASTER.

19:40.045 --> 19:41.413

- [Timmy screams]

20:00.599 --> 20:03.402
[cheers and applause]

20:05.370 --> 20:07.239
- THERE'S NOTHING FUNNIER

20:07.439 --> 20:08.574
THAN WATCHING SOME STUPID
EARTHLING GET EATEN

20:08.774 --> 20:10.475
BY A SPACE WHALE.

20:10.676 --> 20:11.777
OH, OUR TIMMY WOULD LOVE
THIS SHOW.

20:15.347 --> 20:17.482
- [laughs]

20:17.683 --> 20:19.685
- GREAT SHOW, TIMMY.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.253
CAN WE GET YOUR AUTOGRAPH--
YOU KNOW, FOR WANDA?

20:21.453 --> 20:26.158
IT'S SPELLED C-O-S-R--

20:26.358 --> 20:27.593
- NO AUTOGRAPHS!

20:27.793 --> 20:29.628
CONGRATULATIONS, TURNER.

20:29.828 --> 20:31.396
YOUR SILLY ANTICS FINANCED
THE FINAL REPAIRS

20:31.597 --> 20:33.465

MOM, WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.478
DARK LASER'S GOING
TO BLAST US INTO SPACE.

20:46.678 --> 20:49.147
- TIMMY, CALM DOWN.

20:49.348 --> 20:51.617
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST ENJOY
LIVING IN A SPACE ZOO

20:51.817 --> 20:53.852
WITH A GREEN BUTLER, LIKE ME?

20:54.052 --> 20:56.121
- COSMO, WANDA,
YOU GOTTA POOF US ALL HOME.

21:01.026 --> 21:03.028
- SORRY, SPORT.

21:03.228 --> 21:04.863
IT LOOKS LIKE THIS FORCE FIELD
IS MAGIC-PROOF.

21:05.063 --> 21:06.498
- [Dark Laser laughs]

21:06.698 --> 21:08.333
AND NOW TO BLOW UP THE TURNERS.

21:08.533 --> 21:09.735
I HAD THIS BUTTON
ESPECIALLY MADE

21:09.935 --> 21:11.803
FOR THIS OCCASION.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.305
ONLY MYSELF AND TURNER'S
WEIGHT-LIFTING MOTHER

21:13.505 --> 21:15.240
COULD POSSIBLY PUSH IT.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.541
- OH, NO.
WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING FAST.

21:16.742 --> 21:17.843
- [snoring]

21:18.043 --> 21:20.178
FANCY...CASHEWS.

21:20.379 --> 21:21.680
- [laughs]

21:25.550 --> 21:26.885
- I GOT IT!

21:27.085 --> 21:28.453
YOUR MAGIC CAN'T REACH ME,

21:28.654 --> 21:29.321
BUT IT CAN REACH DARK LASER.

21:34.326 --> 21:37.362
- SPINDLY LEGS, BIG TEETH,
STUPID PINK HAT.

21:37.562 --> 21:38.130
OH, NO!

21:44.369 --> 21:45.637
[grunting]

21:45.837 --> 21:47.139
- TURNER, HE'S ESCAPED!

21:50.542 --> 21:51.710
- UNHAND ME, FOOLS.

21:51.910 --> 21:53.278
I'M DARK LASER.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.579
FLIPSY, TELL THEM WHO I AM.

21:54.780 --> 21:56.548
- ARF, ARF!

21:56.748 --> 21:57.149
- THAT'S CUTE,
BUT IT'S NOT HELPING!

22:00.018 --> 22:01.787
- NOW, GUYS!

22:01.987 --> 22:02.654
POOF ME AND MY PARENTS
OUT OF HERE.

22:10.862 --> 22:12.597
- NO PROBLEM.

22:12.798 --> 22:13.632
I'LL JUST ESCAPE
THROUGH THIS TUNNEL.

22:20.072 --> 22:20.772
- LET'S GO HOME.

22:26.745 --> 22:28.580
I WISH ALL THE ALIENS
AND ZOO ANIMALS

22:28.780 --> 22:29.748
WOULD GO BACK
TO THEIR HOME PLANETS.

22:34.453 --> 22:37.289
OH, AND YOU MIGHT AS WELL TURN
DARK LASER BACK TO NORMAL.

22:50.135 --> 22:51.470
[all cheering]

22:51.670 --> 22:53.305
- CURSE YOU, TURNER.

22:53.505 --> 22:55.207
I'LL MAKE YOU PAY!

22:55.407 --> 22:56.908
[laughs]
IT'S NOT THAT FUNNY.

22:57.109 --> 22:58.910
- UH, GUYS, ONE LAST WISH?

22:59.111 --> 23:00.879
- YOU GOT IT, SPORT.

23:01.079 --> 23:02.280
ONE KILLER SPACE WHALE
COMING RIGHT UP.

23:05.851 --> 23:07.018
- [roars]
- [screams]

23:07.219 --> 23:09.121
- TASTES GREAT

23:09.321 --> 23:11.656
BUT COULD US A LITTLE RANCH
ON THE SIDE.

23:11.857 --> 23:13.759
- FLIPSY!
OH!

23:13.959 --> 23:15.560
- I STILL HAVE MY CASHEWS.
