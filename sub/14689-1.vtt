00:16.400 --> 00:18.300

00:37.400 --> 00:41.200
s is my wonderful family.

00:41.200 --> 00:43.300
My wonderful mother, Ellen.

00:43.300 --> 00:44.300
Mother, say hello to the camera.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.700
- Hello.
- Smile. And here we have

00:46.900 --> 00:49.600
my beautiful sister, Samantha.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.500
Samantha,
smile for the camera.

00:52.500 --> 00:54.300
- Smile.
- Is not she beautiful?!

00:56.000 --> 00:57.600
You two... ah...

00:57.600 --> 01:00.100
You matched the colors tonight?

01:00.100 --> 01:01.100
I must have forgotten
read the memo.

01:01.100 --> 01:03.100
Yes, indeed,
let you out of the memo.

01:03.100 --> 01:05.200
Yeah, you left out
because we hate you.

01:05.600 --> 01:07.600
Mom, this is weird.

01:08.600 --> 01:12.500
This is not for you
help wash the dishes, Thomas?

01:12.600 --> 01:13.500
Ah ... not ...

01:13.500 --> 01:15.000
- Why do not you come help us?
- Of course not.

01:15.500 --> 01:17.100
Mom, thank you for dinner.

01:17.100 --> 01:18.100
Your welcome.

01:18.100 --> 01:19.100
It was a wonderful dinner.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.100
Thomas ... I just want to ask ...

01:22.100 --> 01:25.800
I understand that Dr. Lauren 
wants us to do this whole thing ... 

01:25.800 --> 01:28.600
But ... that only has cameras 
in our rooms and not on yours? 

01:28.600 --> 01:31.400
Because ... you would not like 
see what happens in my room. 

01:31.700 --> 01:35.200
Someone would like to ... 
say something ... 

01:35.200 --> 01:37.700
on our experiment here? 

01:37.700 --> 01:41.100
How you will 
make money with the fact that ... 

01:41.100 --> 01:44.600
I will not make money from nothing! 

01:44.700 --> 01:47.200
Mr. Medium said to document everything, 

01:47.200 --> 01:50.200
then, what better way to do this 
than with a camera? 

01:50.200 --> 01:52.500
- And why do not you write? 
- I will not write it. 

01:55.800 --> 02:01.200
Last fall, Thomas Finley was arrested by 
rape and murder of his sister aged 19, Samantha Finley. 

02:01.200 --> 02:05.100
He also was convicted of murder 
Lauren Edgar, a paranormal investigator. 

02:05.100 --> 02:09.100
Thomas says that the victims were attacked 
by a demonic entity of unknown origin. 

02:09.300 --> 02:13.700
He committed suicide soon after, 
while in prison. 

02:17.400 --> 02:21.800
The recording below was found a year later, 
hidden in the attic of the family. 

02:21.800 --> 02:24.500
Is being shown to the public 
the first time. 

02:25.300 --> 02:29.300
We are running ... Testing, testing, 
one, two, three. 

02:29.400 --> 02:31.300
Camera focus. 

02:31.300 --> 02:32.300
And here we are. 

02:33.400 --> 02:34.700
Thomas Finley ... 

02:34.800 --> 02:36.900
This is my fourth. 

02:38.900 --> 02:40.400
Here is where I sleep. 

02:40.400 --> 02:42.300
Today is the day off the employee. 

02:44.400 --> 02:46.500
We're walking down the aisle ... 

02:46.500 --> 02:49.300
to the living room. 

02:50.800 --> 02:54.100
We have a camera ... corner ... 

02:56.100 --> 02:58.800
Filming in night vision ... 

02:59.800 --> 03:01.400
with a battery of 8 hours ... 

03:01.400 --> 03:04.800
to shoot all night and 
pra that we can see ... 

03:04.800 --> 03:08.700
whatever happens ... this room. 

03:09.300 --> 03:14.400
This is the fourth of Samantha. 

03:14.700 --> 03:17.100
We have a ... 

03:17.200 --> 03:19.600
camera on the tripod, 

03:20.500 --> 03:22.500
recording in night vision 

03:22.500 --> 03:24.800
battery with 8 hours 

03:24.800 --> 03:27.500
to film whatever happens 

03:27.500 --> 03:29.600
or not happen.

03:30.300 --> 03:34.300
And then ... if we go down the hall ...

03:35.500 --> 03:37.100
Sorry.

03:38.200 --> 03:39.300
Shit ...

03:40.400 --> 03:43.200
And the mother's room, we have a camera in the corner ...

03:45.400 --> 03:47.100

05:15.900 --> 05:18.800
Hi, you've reached the Finleys.
We can not answer now,

05:18.800 --> 05:22.700
But if you leave a message;
we will return. Thank you.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.500
Good morning.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.800
Someone is wonderful
this morning.

05:53.000 --> 05:53.800
Great.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.500
What we are doing pro coffee?

05:58.500 --> 05:59.500
You will make me ...

06:00.200 --> 06:01.600
I will not do anything for you.

06:01.600 --> 06:03.800
I'm doing this to myself.

06:05.100 --> 06:06.600
This seems to vomit.

06:06.600 --> 06:08.300
Is, do something for you.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.800
I see that someone is
a great mood this morning.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.000
I know.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.400
Especially when they call
my food vomiting.

06:14.400 --> 06:16.100
It makes me really happy.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.900
It makes me great.

06:18.900 --> 06:22.100
You do not have a job
or something to do?

06:22.100 --> 06:24.800
Today I am officially unemployed.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.500
Oh, I'm shocked.

06:26.500 --> 06:27.500
Really shocked.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.200
See, this is my surprise face.

06:30.200 --> 06:31.200
Ah, that's good. 

06:31.200 --> 06:32.800
Yes it is recording? 

06:33.100 --> 06:35.000
Is that I'm surprised 
for you being unemployed. 

06:35.000 --> 06:36.800
I think I'll win 
an award for it. 

06:36.800 --> 06:39.100
It is a real loser. 

06:39.800 --> 06:41.300
So ... um ... 

06:41.900 --> 06:44.600
Some dad's visit 
tonight? 

06:46.400 --> 06:47.600
Not funny. 

06:47.600 --> 06:49.700
Let your sister in peace, Tommy. 

06:49.700 --> 06:50.700
Ok? 

06:50.700 --> 06:51.700
Just stop. 

06:52.300 --> 06:53.800
What about you, mother? 

06:55.400 --> 06:57.600
Something happened that night? 

06:57.700 --> 06:59.600
He made coffee, Sam? 

07:00.700 --> 07:01.400
No. 

07:02.600 --> 07:03.600
Mother

07:06.000 --> 07:08.600
- Yes, Tommy. 
- Something happened? 

07:09.100 --> 07:11.100
- I do not want to talk about it. 
- I think we should talk. 

07:11.200 --> 07:13.700
I think it is important to discuss 
about what is happening in this house. 

07:13.800 --> 07:15.400
- Turn off the camera. 
- And what is happening. 

07:15.700 --> 07:16.300
Turn off the camera. 

07:16.300 --> 07:18.600
I think if you say 
who is talking to Dad ... 

07:18.600 --> 07:20.500
Turn that damn camera! 

07:28.900 --> 07:31.600
About a year 
my husband David ... 

07:32.700 --> 07:35.600
died in a car accident. 

07:38.500 --> 07:40.600
And I'm sorry to miss him. 

07:45.200 --> 07:47.800
There is even a day 
I do not think it ... 

07:52.500 --> 07:54.800
A couple of months ... 

07:54.800 --> 07:58.100
I just started talking to him. 

07:58.500 --> 07:59.100
Know ... I just ... 

08:00.500 --> 08:03.800
Just got a. .. 
talk, pretending 

08:13.000 --> 08:15.800
store very strange ... weird ... 

08:17.800 --> 08:21.000
And there was a lady there, 
and she was telling us that ... 

08:21.100 --> 08:24.500
You can actually ... 
can speak with the dead ... 

08:24.500 --> 08:26.000
writing for them. 

08:26.600 --> 08:29.700
So I said, "Okay." 

08:29.700 --> 08:31.900
So I went home e. .. 

08:33.900 --> 08:36.799
I picked up a pen and 
a pad of paper ... 

08:37.299 --> 08:39.600
I started writing one night. 

08:40.500 --> 08:43.900
I wrote e. .. 
just wrote ... 

08:44.500 --> 08:46.100
E. .. 

08:47.300 --> 08:51.300
I felt that something was me ... 
was taking care of me. 

08:52.500 --> 08:53.800
I just ... 

08:53.800 --> 08:56.200
I felt I was really 
talking with David 

08:56.200 --> 08:59.000
and that he was 
really responding, you know? 

08:59.000 --> 09:02.500
I mean ... 
each ... every word I wrote ... 

09:02.600 --> 09:05.500
it was as if he were there with me. 

09:05.500 --> 09:11.000
And then every night I went to my room 
and wrote to him and he answered me. 

09:11.500 --> 09:14.500
I really think 
I was talking to David. 

09:18.600 --> 09:20.700
But then these ... 

09:22.200 --> 09:25.300
Then some strange things 
started happening e. .. 

09:26.300 --> 09:29.100
I do not know, it's like ... 

09:31.700 --> 09:34.500
I do not know ... bad things ... 

09:39.700 --> 09:43.000
Things happening riuns 
with Samantha. 

09:50.200 --> 09:52.800
Bad things happening. 

10:00.400 --> 10:05.500
That is not David, OK? 
David does not ... 

10:06.400 --> 10:08.600
not do these things. 

10:12.700 --> 10:14.700
What do you think that is? 

10:18.600 --> 10:21.200
I do not know. 

10:22.400 --> 10:24.300
I do not know. 

10:24.500 --> 10:26.900
I do not know what the hell is this. 

10:29.800 --> 10:32.800
Whatever it is, 
not his father. 

10:46.000 --> 10:47.700
What was that? 

11:01.300 --> 11:03.300
Oh shit! 

11:04.500 --> 11:06.400
He left. 

11:11.000 --> 11:13.600
Christ. 

11:17.000 --> 11:19.400
And the camera is ... 

11:20.800 --> 11:22.200
on. 

11:32.000 --> 11:33.800
'm In the next room. 

11:41.100 --> 11:44.900
Monday night 
October 4 
3:43 

13:22.600 --> 13:23.900
Tommy! 

13:31.400 --> 13:32.400
What? 

13:43.600 --> 13:46.100
I found this on the floor. 

13:49.900 --> 13:51.200
Give me that. 

14:15.000 --> 14:19.000
What I am saying to Sam is that it is 
possible that the cross has fallen from the wall. 

14:20.000 --> 14:22.200
And ended up in the corner ...? 

14:22.200 --> 14:24.900
Things do not fall from the walls, 
hit the ground and move to the corners. 

14:24.900 --> 14:28.000
No, they do not fly diagonal e. .. 

14:28.000 --> 14:30.400
- Who said that? 
- Things do not square roll. 

14:30.700 --> 14:33.700
I did not say rolled, 
but what if the wall fell diagonally ... 

14:33.700 --> 14:35.400
I was far away. 

14:35.400 --> 14:38.200
So you can have kicked ... 

14:39.800 --> 14:42.800
And if she kicked? 

14:42.800 --> 14:43.100
What if ... 

14:43.300 --> 14:47.100
No, if the cross fell from the wall, that does not mean 
she kicked, that's what I'm saying. 

14:47.100 --> 14:50.100
I do not like the fact that you 
suggest that your sister is lying. 

14:50.100 --> 14:51.500
- I'm not suggesting that. 
- You are. 

14:51.700 --> 14:53.500
I even said that she 
lying. 

14:53.500 --> 14:55.000
Well, these things may have happened. 

14:55.000 --> 14:57.500
If the cross fell from the wall, it does not 
means that the ghost dropped. 

14:57.500 --> 15:00.200
- No, no, you're right. 
- Not to say that the ghost did it. 

15:00.600 --> 15:02.400
You're right ... 
Did not mean it. 

15:02.600 --> 15:03.600
Yes, I am sure, Sam. 

15:03.600 --> 15:06.100
Yeah, you're totally right. 
Not mean anything. 

15:06.100 --> 15:08.300
There is nothing happening here, Mom. 
I just say that this does not mean anything. 

15:08.700 --> 15:12.700
Yeah, he's trying to say that this gives 
a good scene pra a fucking movie, that's all. 

15:12.800 --> 15:15.800
Shut up, damn it, really. 
I'm tired of hearing you say that.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.100
- I do not give a damn. 
- Stop with the words, OK. 

15:19.400 --> 15:20.400
Stop! Stop! 

15:20.400 --> 15:22.400
I want you to stop! 
Stop! 

15:29.100 --> 15:31.300
Christ! 

15:33.600 --> 15:34.400
Hallo. 

15:35.800 --> 15:38.100
He has to keep shit 
camera on?! 

15:42.600 --> 15:45.000
In fact, he does not live here anymore. 

15:47.500 --> 15:48.300
No. 

15:50.700 --> 15:52.200
Okay. 

15:53.800 --> 15:54.600
Bye. 

16:03.500 --> 16:04.700
Great. 

16:05.000 --> 16:06.100
Very well done ... 

16:06.700 --> 16:08.600
fucking asshole. 

16:11.900 --> 16:12.900
Mother 

16:20.200 --> 16:21.000
Hallo. 

16:24.100 --> 16:25.000
Hallo. 

16:26.800 --> 16:28.300
Aloo. 

16:45.900 --> 16:47.000
Sam. 

17:27.300 --> 17:31.600
Last night, my cross fell from the wall. 
Only I'm sure it was played there. 

17:31.600 --> 17:35.500
Thomas refuses to believe me. 
Or he does not want. 'm Very scared. 

17:35.500 --> 17:39.000
Please God, help me! 
Where are You?? 

17:52.000 --> 17:54.500
Why am I seeing this? 

18:26.400 --> 18:27.300
Hein. 

18:28.900 --> 18:29.600
Hi 

18:31.300 --> 18:33.800
Sorry for yelling. 

18:38.700 --> 18:43.000
Why do you say that now 
I'm ready to sleep? 

18:43.200 --> 18:47.200
Why an apology and 
I thought I would go on record. 

18:49.600 --> 18:52.000
But you still think I 
do not believe in you. 

18:52.000 --> 18:55.000
- You do not believe. 
- I believe. 

18:56.800 --> 18:59.400
Everything is confusing, you know. 

19:02.500 --> 19:05.700
So sorry, I do not 
wanted to scream. 

19:10.000 --> 19:11.600
Legal? 

19:17.800 --> 19:19.000
Yes 

19:19.800 --> 19:21.300
Cool. 

19:22.300 --> 19:23.100

20:00.900 --> 20:02.300
David? 

20:07.000 --> 20:07.900
David? 

22:26.000 --> 22:27.500
Tommy! 

22:29.200 --> 22:30.400
Tommy! 

22:34.100 --> 22:35.200
Tom! 

22:35.400 --> 22:36.300
What? 

22:36.500 --> 22:37.300
You did that? 

22:38.000 --> 22:39.200
I did what? 

22:39.300 --> 22:40.900
Wrote on the table. 

22:43.400 --> 22:46.000
- What the fuck? 
- Not funny, man. 

22:46.400 --> 22:48.200
Look, I did not. 

22:49.600 --> 22:50.500
Mother! 

22:52.000 --> 22:54.200
- What the hell does that mean? 
- Mom 

22:55.800 --> 22:56.900
- What? 
- U C. 

22:57.000 --> 22:58.000
Come here! 

23:01.000 --> 23:02.400
U C. .. 

23:02.800 --> 23:04.000
Mom, you did it? 

23:06.500 --> 23:07.400
No. 

23:08.100 --> 23:09.000
No! 

23:10.400 --> 23:12.500
I did not write it. 

23:14.700 --> 23:16.300
Someone wrote! 

23:25.100 --> 23:26.300
What does it mean? 

23:40.200 --> 23:42.000
Do not you remember doing that? 

23:42.900 --> 23:44.300
No. 

23:45.100 --> 23:46.500
No. 

23:47.800 --> 23:49.900
I do not remember any of it. 

23:56.000 --> 23:57.400
Well, you did. 

24:00.600 --> 24:02.700
I do not remember getting off the bed. 

24:06.300 --> 24:08.300
3:30 in the morning. 

24:12.000 --> 24:14.200
You think I was sleepwalking? 

24:15.000 --> 24:19.800
I mean, never heard of anyone 
sleepwalker and writing at a desk ... 

24:20.100 --> 24:23.000
I do not know, Thomas, not 
I have no idea. 

24:25.200 --> 24:27.100
And you do not know what to write? 

24:27.100 --> 24:31.100
- You do not know what it means? 
- I do not remember being lifted. 

24:31.600 --> 24:33.500
So you do not know what 
the letters on the table mean? 

24:33.500 --> 24:34.500
No. 

24:35.900 --> 24:38.900
And you took the paper to somewhere. 
You were with the paper in hand. 

24:42.800 --> 24:43.900
Oh, God. 

24:44.300 --> 24:45.600
And that's all. 

24:51.600 --> 24:53.100
It's very bizarre mother. 

24:54.200 --> 24:55.000
Thomas ... 

24:55.600 --> 24:57.400
What's wrong with me? 

24:57.900 --> 25:01.000
There is something wrong with me. 
I do not remember any of it. 

25:01.400 --> 25:02.800
What the hell is happening? 

25:03.500 --> 25:05.400
I'm going crazy! 

25:05.400 --> 25:07.400
Mom, I think it has something 
happening in this house. 

25:07.400 --> 25:11.400
Do not know if there is something wrong with you. 
There is something wrong with this house. 

25:12.400 --> 25:14.700
Where is this doctor? 

25:14.700 --> 25:18.400
Dr. Lauren, I called him several times, 
he is still on vacation. 

25:18.400 --> 25:21.900
And he goes on to say that when you return 
he will come back here as soon as possible. 

25:22.400 --> 25:26.700
He knows what's going on? 
He know what is happening with Samantha? 

25:27.100 --> 25:28.200
Because ... um ... mother ... 

25:29.100 --> 25:30.400
I think she is going crazy with it. 

25:30.400 --> 25:33.900
I increasingly I think all 
has something to do with it. 

25:34.100 --> 25:37.500
I know, of course ... ... I i know. 

25:37.800 --> 25:40.100
- I think you're right. 
- Well, let's ... 

25:40.200 --> 25:41.200
Tomorrow, I think ... 

25:41.900 --> 25:44.100
So let's call this new Dr. Lauren 

25:44.200 --> 25:47.700
and say that he needs to come here 
as soon as possible. 

25:48.000 --> 25:50.500
I'll call him tomorrow morning again. 

25:50.500 --> 25:51.500
Sure. 

25:51.500 --> 25:53.100
Or I'll find someone else. 

25:55.000 --> 25:55.500
OK.

26:02.200 --> 26:03.200
You okay? 

26:12.600 --> 26:14.900
I'll think of something. 

26:16.900 --> 26:18.200
I'll think of something. 

26:32.300 --> 26:33.600
So I ... 

26:38.800 --> 26:42.500
There is a time, I began to feel like ... 

26:44.700 --> 26:48.000
if something was in the room ... 

26:48.400 --> 26:50.800
me while I slept. 

26:52.400 --> 26:55.500
When I was trying to sleep ... 

26:57.100 --> 26:58.300
And then ... 

27:02.000 --> 27:03.600
a week ago ... 

27:10.000 --> 27:15.400
I woke up for something ... 
I do not know what woke me up ... 

27:16.400 --> 27:17.600
I could not ... 

27:20.000 --> 27:22.900
out of bed. 

27:23.700 --> 27:25.300
I was just ... 

27:27.500 --> 27:29.000
lying there ... 

27:31.400 --> 27:33.600
and I could not sit, 
... I could not 

27:34.300 --> 27:39.000
turn my head to see 
what woke me up ... 

27:39.700 --> 27:41.000
I just ... 

27:45.600 --> 27:47.400
And then it was as if ... 

27:48.600 --> 27:51.300
something came ... 

27:55.300 --> 27:59.900
and pressed ... my chest, very strong. 

28:04.700 --> 28:06.100
It was as if ... 

28:07.000 --> 28:12.500
was holding me, as if ... 
did not want me to move. 

28:13.200 --> 28:17.100
It was very strange, it took everything ... 

28:17.800 --> 28:18.600
I ... 

28:23.100 --> 28:26.200
All energy that I could check for ... 

28:26.300 --> 28:27.900
to sit ... 

28:29.500 --> 28:30.700
and look around the room ... 

28:31.700 --> 28:35.700
It was as if someone was me 
squeezing with one hand ... 

28:39.400 --> 28:42.200
But then ... I got up e. .. 

28:43.200 --> 28:44.800
turned on the lights e. .. 

28:46.600 --> 28:48.300
there was nothing ... 

28:50.500 --> 28:55.800
... I thought I mean ... 
the time I thought I was crazy ... 

28:59.000 --> 29:02.700
and then these other things 
started happening ... 

29:06.700 --> 29:09.200
I just do not understand why 
this is happening to me. 

29:11.100 --> 29:13.200
So this was the first time that happened? 

29:18.200 --> 29:19.500
Yes 

29:21.200 --> 29:23.300
Do you think it will happen again? 

29:28.400 --> 29:30.500
I do not know. 

29:33.400 --> 29:39.300
I do not know, it's like every time I 
go to sleep, I was lying there e. .. 

29:42.400 --> 29:44.900
wanting to sleep, but if I ... 

29:45.000 --> 29:48.900
if I sleep, I'm afraid 
wake up and happen. 

29:48.900 --> 29:51.100
and if I stay up, nothing happens, then ... 

29:52.600 --> 29:55.000
So I did not even sleep e. .. 

30:02.800 --> 30:03.600
I do not know. 

30:06.600 --> 30:08.500
And no one comes out winning. 

30:13.400 --> 30:14.800
Nobody wins. 

30:26.500 --> 30:30.800
Friday Night 
8 October 
2:34 

31:28.300 --> 31:29.900
Tommy! 

31:30.200 --> 31:31.700
Tommy! 

31:33.300 --> 31:35.100
Open the door! 

31:35.100 --> 31:38.000
- Tommy ... stop! 
- Open the door! 

31:40.300 --> 31:42.400
It's okay, I'm here! 

31:42.400 --> 31:43.400
Okay! 

31:44.800 --> 31:46.500
I'm here. 

31:48.000 --> 31:48.700
Ok 

31:49.900 --> 31:51.000
You okay? 

32:00.400 --> 32:04.100
Oh, yes. Hello, Dr. Lauren, here is Ellen Finley e. .. 

32:04.700 --> 32:07.600

32:07.600 --> 32:09.900
Probably you are still on vacation 

32:09.900 --> 32:11.900
But I need to talk to you. 

32:11.900 --> 32:14.600
So ... you could call them to hear this message? 

32:14.600 --> 32:16.800
It is very important that I talk to you, OK?

32:19.200 --> 32:22.000

32:45.900 --> 32:47.200

35:29.300 --> 35:30.900
Maron. 

35:35.700 --> 35:40.000
Seventh Night 
9 October 
1:22 

36:15.500 --> 36:21.300
Hi, you've reached the Finleys. We can not answer now, 
but if you leave a message, will return. Thank you. 

36:24.600 --> 36:29.900
Ohh mother ... 

37:03.900 --> 37:04.900
What is this?! 

37:06.600 --> 37:07.900
It seems that someone is ... 

37:08.400 --> 37:10.800
I do not know, I do not know. 

37:11.900 --> 37:13.700
- Come on, all is well. 
- What was that? 

37:13.800 --> 37:14.500
I do not know. 

37:14.500 --> 37:15.500
Hear, hear! 

37:17.400 --> 37:18.800
Go, go! 

37:22.100 --> 37:23.700
Stay behind me. 

37:48.000 --> 37:49.300
We are here, here. 

37:53.100 --> 37:54.600
Oh, my God! Damn! 

37:55.700 --> 37:57.100
Listen! Listen! 

37:57.800 --> 37:59.500
- There is something in the room with us! 
- Oh, my God. 

37:59.900 --> 38:01.100
I can feel, I ... 

38:01.100 --> 38:03.600
- I can feel as if he were standing here! 
- Stop! Stop! 

38:03.800 --> 38:04.800
Listen! 

38:08.400 --> 38:09.600
What the fuck ...?

38:11.200 --> 38:12.400
Listen! 

38:14.800 --> 38:16.000
Guys, what is it? 

38:16.800 --> 38:17.900
You hear it?! 

38:18.600 --> 38:20.000
What the hell is that? 

38:20.100 --> 38:21.300
Look at it ... 

38:22.500 --> 38:23.800
Wait, wait. 

38:27.100 --> 38:28.300
My God! 

38:28.300 --> 38:30.100
Look at it, is a footprint! 

38:32.900 --> 38:34.000
I want to see where he is going. 

38:34.000 --> 38:35.000
- No! 
- Come on! Okay! 

38:35.400 --> 38:37.000
Thomas, no! No! 

38:37.200 --> 38:39.600
- Stay here, I want to see where he is going! 
- Stop it! 

38:39.700 --> 38:40.900
No! Stop! 

38:41.000 --> 38:42.000
Let me go! 

38:42.900 --> 38:44.700
I just want to see where he is going. 

38:47.800 --> 38:49.400
Stay with me, it's okay! 

38:51.000 --> 38:52.200
All right. 

38:57.300 --> 38:59.500
They are everywhere! 

38:59.700 --> 38:59.800
Come! 

39:01.600 --> 39:02.600
Mother! 

39:03.000 --> 39:04.100
What the fuck ...? 

39:04.100 --> 39:05.100
Why ... is going to my room?! 

39:06.800 --> 39:08.900
Oh, Jesus! Stop! 

39:09.800 --> 39:10.500
Stop! 

39:32.000 --> 39:33.600
Alright! Okay! 

39:35.100 --> 39:37.100
Sam, come here, come here! 

39:37.200 --> 39:38.100
All right. 

39:38.300 --> 39:39.500
All right, come. 

40:07.100 --> 40:08.700
Ash. 

41:09.900 --> 41:11.600
Oh, Christ. 

42:36.700 --> 42:38.100
Where does it come from? 

43:51.300 --> 43:52.600
Oh, shit! 

44:05.200 --> 44:06.700
Oh, no! 

44:12.400 --> 44:13.400
Fuck! 

45:18.000 --> 45:22.500
Oh, mother ... 

45:27.700 --> 45:29.000
What the fuck? 

45:34.200 --> 45:38.900
Oh, mother ... 

45:43.000 --> 45:44.600
Who was it? 

45:44.600 --> 45:45.600
Nobody. 

46:05.500 --> 46:06.300
Mother 

46:06.600 --> 46:08.100
Yes 

46:11.200 --> 46:12.500
How are you? 

46:16.400 --> 46:17.500
All right? 

46:19.700 --> 46:20.900
Sam, you okay? 

46:23.500 --> 46:24.300
See ... 

46:24.300 --> 46:28.000
I think it's time to ... think of leaving. 

46:28.500 --> 46:30.900
- And where do we go? 
- I do not know, to a motel for a few nights. 

46:31.000 --> 46:33.500
- This is our home ... 
- I know, Mom, but I do not think ... 

46:33.800 --> 46:34.800
- Where do we go? 
- It's getting ... 

46:34.900 --> 46:38.100
This thing just goes ... us out of our house? 

46:38.600 --> 46:40.700
Mom, I do not know, but I think ... 

46:40.700 --> 46:41.700
I can not ... 

46:43.400 --> 46:44.200
Damn! 

46:45.700 --> 46:49.300
- Mom, I know, but ... 
- By Dr. Lauren not called yet?! 

46:49.500 --> 46:51.100
Do not know! Do not know where he is, 

46:51.100 --> 46:53.400
But until he calls and 
people think of something ... 

46:53.400 --> 46:56.400
I think you should stay 
in a motel for a few nights. 

46:56.400 --> 47:00.400
So? That solves everything? 
The thing will just go away?! 

47:00.600 --> 47:01.600
No, I'm saying this, Mom. 

47:01.600 --> 47:06.300
But until Dr. Lauren comes, you go, 
I stay and take care of everything ... 

47:06.300 --> 47:07.300
I see what happens. 

47:08.500 --> 47:10.200
You'll see what happens? 

47:10.700 --> 47:12.200
I will record what happens. 

47:12.200 --> 47:15.200
I'll keep shooting and see what 
happens while you are away. 

47:15.400 --> 47:17.900
Ok and you'll stay here alone with this thing? 

47:18.200 --> 47:21.500
I want you to be cautelozo, Thomas. 
You know where you're getting into? 

47:21.500 --> 47:22.600
I know, Mom, but ... 

47:22.600 --> 47:26.200
Whatever this thing is, 
it does not seem interested in me. 

47:26.200 --> 47:29.900
And that seems to be interested in it, 
which is another reason for you leave here. 

47:29.900 --> 47:32.300
I know, I'll take it. We will. 

47:32.300 --> 47:33.300
Sam? 

47:33.300 --> 47:36.100
- Sam, you do not want to leave? 
- Ok? 

47:39.300 --> 47:40.100
Sure! 

47:41.900 --> 47:44.500
- Prepare to pack. 
- We go now, but I want you to promise ... 

47:44.900 --> 47:48.900
- That if something bad happens ... 
- Mom, believe me, I promise, trust me. 

47:49.300 --> 47:51.600
I do not want you just film 
I want you to leave here. 

47:51.600 --> 47:53.500
I will. 

47:53.600 --> 47:55.400
Right? Come! Prepare to pack. 

47:57.400 --> 48:00.400
And I want you to call us, 
if anything happens. 

48:04.300 --> 48:07.400
- You'll be okay? Are you sure? 
- I'll be fine. 

48:07.800 --> 48:10.200
- Just go, call me when they arrive. 
- Ok 

48:15.700 --> 48:16.700
I love you. 

48:16.700 --> 48:17.700
I love you too. 

48:19.200 --> 48:20.900
Call me when they arrive. 

48:20.900 --> 48:21.900
Ok 

48:23.200 --> 48:24.500
Be careful, dear. 

48:24.500 --> 48:25.500
You too. 

50:21.200 --> 50:22.700
Camera on. 

53:28.400 --> 53:29.900
And then, asshole! 

53:31.500 --> 53:33.000
Appear. 

53:46.500 --> 53:49.800
Oitva Night 
October 10 
2:28 

54:46.600 --> 54:47.700
Jesus! 

54:48.300 --> 54:49.400
Crap! 

55:02.800 --> 55:03.800
Christ! 

55:15.000 --> 55:16.500
Jesus! 

55:16.500 --> 55:17.500
Crap! 

55:30.800 --> 55:32.000
Oh, shit! 

56:09.000 --> 56:09.700
Hallo. 

56:12.800 --> 56:13.700
Mother? 

56:15.800 --> 56:18.600
Mother, calm down. As well 
they followed you?

56:21.900 --> 56:24.100
Wait, Mom, listen! Just come home, right? 

56:24.700 --> 56:26.700
Just come as fast as you can! 

56:28.500 --> 56:30.200
Just come home. 

57:23.300 --> 57:25.100
Jesus! What the hell happened? 

57:25.800 --> 57:27.200
What happened?!?! 

57:28.400 --> 57:29.800
Oh, Christ! You all right? 

57:31.300 --> 57:32.900
What happened to you? 

57:34.000 --> 57:37.500
- They have followed us to the motel. 
- What do you follow? 

57:39.100 --> 57:40.000
Sam? 

57:43.900 --> 57:46.000
They followed us to the motel, Thomas. 

57:46.200 --> 57:47.500
How could they follow you? 

57:47.500 --> 57:50.400
I do not know. I do not know how they could. 

57:50.400 --> 57:53.100
But it was in the room with the 
people and attacked his sister. 

57:53.100 --> 57:55.000
As well, was in the room with you? 

57:55.000 --> 57:58.000
- I was in bed with us, Thomas. 
- How it attacked ...? 

58:00.100 --> 58:02.000
Talk to me, you're scaring me ... 

58:02.000 --> 58:03.800
As they attacked? 

58:07.100 --> 58:08.000
Mother? 

58:11.000 --> 58:12.000
What happened? 

58:22.600 --> 58:24.900
I do not know what happened, Thomas. 

58:28.300 --> 58:30.300
We were just sleeping ... 

58:34.500 --> 58:37.400
I thought everything was ... 
He felt that all was well. 

58:39.100 --> 58:39.800
And then ... 

58:40.800 --> 58:44.000
Suddenly I felt that ... 

58:44.500 --> 58:47.600
something was sighing in my ear. 

58:50.300 --> 58:54.300
And I woke up and looked at her sister ... 

58:54.500 --> 58:56.300
And she was still asleep. 

58:58.500 --> 59:00.600
But I looked down e. .. 

59:01.300 --> 59:03.300
It seemed that something was ... 

59:03.900 --> 59:07.700
holding, pressing her arms. 

59:10.300 --> 59:11.200
So ... 

59:13.300 --> 59:15.700
That threw me off the bed. 

59:16.200 --> 59:17.900
This thing ... 

59:17.900 --> 59:19.400
threw the bed. 

59:23.100 --> 59:28.700
I cried ... ... I I could not do anything. 

59:32.400 --> 59:34.200
There was nothing I could do. 

59:36.200 --> 59:40.800
This thing ... we have to do this thing 
go. We must stop this! 

59:42.100 --> 59:43.800
I could not do anything. 

59:50.900 --> 59:52.500
Will be alright. 

01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.100
There was nothing I could do. 

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:06.400
I'm sorry, honey, I'm sorry. 

01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:54.600
Thirteenth Night 
October 15 
3:01 

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.100
You'll be okay here alone? 

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.900
You okay? 

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:23.700
Call me if you need anything. 

01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.400
Tommy. 

01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:43.400
Sam? 

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:29.600
Sam? 

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.000
Sam?! 

01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:31.800
Samantha! 

01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.200
What is it? 

01:06:41.300 --> 01:06:42.300
Sam? 

01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:35.900
Sam? 

01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:11.300
Sam? 

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.300
Samantha! 

01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:20.300
Sam. 

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.700
Sam! 

01:08:32.899 --> 01:08:34.200
Samantha! 

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.399
Jesus Christ! Samantha! 

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:42.500
Samantha! 

01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:45.399
Sam. 

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:48.800
Can you hear me? 

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:49.800
Yes 

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:53.700
I came here. 

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:55.200
How so? 

01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:58.000
C'mon, Sam, is freezing here, 
we go down. 

01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.700
Watch your walk. 

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.500
Come on, it's all legal, 
we go down. 

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.100
Watch your walk. 

01:09:05.399 --> 01:09:07.300
Come on, Sam, is freezing, 
we go down. 

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:09.600
You okay? 

01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:22.399
Sam? 

01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:32.399
Sam? 

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:42.600
You okay? 

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:49.500
Really? 

01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:56.300
Will be alright. 

01:10:04.800 --> 01:10:07.000
Hi, I want to talk to Mrs. Mackenzie. 

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:12.300
Mrs. Mackenzie hello, here is Thomas Finley. 

01:10:12.300 --> 01:10:14.900
My parents bought their house a few years. 

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.000
Sure. Hmm ... 

01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:22.300
Listen, sorry for taking your time, 
but I wonder if I can help. 

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:26.100
You know, by chance, if someone ... ah ... 

01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:28.700
If someone died in this house? 

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.900
Someone named Maron? 

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:32.600
Or Marón? 

01:10:34.300 --> 01:10:39.100
Nobody? Spells as M-A-R-O-N. 
No one with that name? 

01:10:42.100 --> 01:10:43.800
Ah ... No, do not worry. 

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:46.600
Thank you. 

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.600
Sorry for taking your time. 

01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:03.800
Sam?! 

01:11:07.100 --> 01:11:08.000
Sam! 

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:12.500
Sam! 

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.200
What is this thing doing? 

01:11:15.700 --> 01:11:17.500
Come here, come here. 

01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:19.800
Come here! 

01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:21.200
Sam, all right! 

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:23.400
Sam, me, come with me. 

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.100
Jesus Christ! 

01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:30.100
What the fuck, come here. 

01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.700
It's all right, right!

01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:32.700
All right. 

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.400
Come, come. 

01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:35.500
Sam, I got you. 

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:36.500
I got you, everything is fine. 

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.200
Okay, I got you. 

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:42.500
Okay. 

01:11:44.700 --> 01:11:45.500
Come on, Sam. 

01:11:49.200 --> 01:11:50.000
Yes 

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:53.300
Yes, yes. 

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.800
She's in bed now. 

01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:58.000
Yes 

01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:04.500
No, I'm sure. 
This never happened before. 

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.700
No, I have no idea. 

01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:12.500
He just found it that way. 

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:14.400
Yes 

01:12:19.200 --> 01:12:22.100
Well, I mean ... 
Is there something I can do? 

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.800
I mean ... should I ... 

01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:27.800
You can ... can find someone 
to find out what's going on? 

01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:30.900
You can prescribe a remedy 
when I see you tomorrow? 

01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:40.700
Sure. 

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:44.600
Ok 

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:49.200
I then ... so I hope. 

01:12:53.100 --> 01:12:53.800
Ok 

01:12:54.300 --> 01:12:55.100
Thank you. 

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.000
Sam? 

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:56.700
Oh, Jesus Christ. 

01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:27.600
Mother? 

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:32.700
Oh, Jesus. 

01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.900
Jesus! Mother! 

01:14:37.100 --> 01:14:39.700
Mom, come here. Jesus Christ! 

01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:40.700
What a bummer. 

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.900
Mom, come on! Come on, Mom, get up. 

01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:45.700
Mother, get up. 

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:46.700
Come on, you have to get up. 

01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:47.700
Come! 

01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:50.300
- It's my fault! 
- Nothing is your fault, Mom. 

01:14:50.500 --> 01:14:51.700
Come, it's all right. 

01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:55.000
- I killed her! 
- Mother, you did not kill anyone. 

01:14:55.300 --> 01:14:56.700
It will kill her. 

01:14:57.100 --> 01:14:59.600
Mother! Nothing will kill her mother. 

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:08.900

01:17:35.300 --> 01:17:37.100
What did you do, mother?! 

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:39.600
Oh, my God, what have you done to yourself?! 

01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.000
Samantha! 

01:17:41.700 --> 01:17:43.600
Oh, mother, what did you do? 

01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:45.400

Twenty-Third Night

2:51 

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:17.800
Mother 

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:25.700
If you see this ... ah ... 

01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:30.300
They said you'll be fine. 

01:18:32.200 --> 01:18:33.800
They just need ... 

01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:36.600
Heard you for a few days ... 

01:18:39.800 --> 01:18:40.700
But ... 

01:18:43.100 --> 01:18:45.300
I just like to say I'm sorry. 

01:18:51.600 --> 01:18:53.300
I should have listened to you. 

01:18:57.500 --> 01:18:59.000
I should be there for you. 

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:02.900
And Samantha. 

01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:08.200
And I was not. 

01:19:18.600 --> 01:19:20.600
I just like to say I'm sorry, Mom. 

01:19:28.700 --> 01:19:31.100
I want us to be a family again. 

01:19:49.800 --> 01:19:51.100
What's happening? 

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.800
Dr. Lauren, hello. 

01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:03.900
Between. 

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:06.400
This is my sister, Samantha. 

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:09.100
- Hello, Samantha, nice to meet you. 
- Also. 

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:10.400
Thanks for coming. 

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:13.300
If I could come here 
earlier, I would ... 

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:16.600
I want to say how I feel 
from what I heard about your mother. 

01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:18.100
How is she? 

01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:20.900
She is ... okay. 

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:23.800
She has to stay under observation, but ... 
She'll be fine. 

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:28.000
- Well, if I could I would be here before. 
- You can make it stop? 

01:20:29.400 --> 01:20:30.700
I'll try. 

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:35.900
Samantha, I understand 
all events here ... 

01:20:35.900 --> 01:20:38.000
acontedendo are in your room. 

01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.300
- Yes 
- Take me there. 

01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.000
Here. 

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.300
Ok 

01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:04.800
Ok 

01:22:07.200 --> 01:22:10.200
First, I want to thank 
the two did not go away. 

01:22:11.200 --> 01:22:12.800
Because that would follow. 

01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:19.000
And probably leave this thing more angry. 

01:22:19.400 --> 01:22:21.800
So I think you acted right 
for calling me. 

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:24.300
We just want to make it stop. 

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:27.100
I understand, Sam. 

01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:28.100
Same. 

01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:34.200
But I want to assure them that 
There is an incredible presence in this house. 

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:37.600
It is a very negative presence. 

01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:41.700
And it's very attracted to you, Sam. 

01:22:43.200 --> 01:22:49.400
Now, as I understand it, his mother 
tried to make contact, or believes he made contact ... 

01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:51.300
with his father. Is this true? 

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:52.300
Yes 

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:55.300
Ok, now ... 

01:22:56.200 --> 01:23:00.000
What made her think that she was exposed?

01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:04.000
Ah, she was writing him ... 

01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.800
She was writing to him and then ... 

01:23:05.800 --> 01:23:10.500
she thought he was responding. 

01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:14.000
Ok Well, that ... 
This is quite common, because when ... 

01:23:14.400 --> 01:23:16.300
when someone loses a loved one ... 

01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:20.600
and try to make contact with this person ... 

01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:23.400
They sometimes do not know ... 

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:27.300
Invite an obscure entity. 

01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:30.300
It's like an open door, so to speak. 

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.100
A free pass. 

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:39.300
And most of the time is that this entity 

01:23:39.300 --> 01:23:44.000
personifies ... and takes the place of that loved one ... 

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:48.700
to enter our world. 

01:23:48.700 --> 01:23:51.300
For some reason. Ok? 

01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:52.300
And in this case ... 

01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.400
I believe ... 

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.300
Sam is the reason. 

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.800
Ok Then ... 

01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:11.000
Before we begin, I want you to know ... 
I want you to think ... 

01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:15.900
Is there anything I have forgotten. 
Anything that can tell me. 

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.500
I just wanted ... 
show it. 

01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.900
We do not know what it means. 

01:24:27.100 --> 01:24:28.100
Ok 

01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:30.400
Maron ... 

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.800
is Germanic for "nightmare". 

01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.300
Ok? In Germanic folklore ... 

01:24:40.700 --> 01:24:42.900
a nightmare is an evil spirit ... 

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:47.100
attacking women while they sleep. 

01:24:47.800 --> 01:24:51.600
Much like the Christian Incubus ... 

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:54.400
that violent women. 

01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:56.700
Ok? 

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:01.000
Now, before you start, I just want to ... 

01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:09.200
are extremely, extremly clean. 

01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:14.800
And I have 100% of your attention 
and its concentration. 

01:25:15.800 --> 01:25:17.000
Yes 

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:19.000
Sam? 

01:25:19.700 --> 01:25:20.200
Ok 

01:25:25.700 --> 01:25:27.300
Samantha! 

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.700
Samantha! 

01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:33.400
Oh, my God, damn! 

01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:36.800
Oh, Samantha! 

01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:43.300
Samantha! 

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:49.600
Samantha! 

01:25:52.700 --> 01:25:53.900
Samantha! 

01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:57.200
Samantha! 

01:25:57.500 --> 01:25:58.700
Oh, my God! 

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:00.100
Oh, my God! 

01:26:02.200 --> 01:26:04.300
Samantha, oh my God! 

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:07.800
Samantha! 

01:26:08.200 --> 01:26:10.000
Oh, my ... Oh, my God! 

01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:11.500
Oh, my God! 

01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:55.400
On October 25, the bodies were 
removed from the residence of Finleys. 

01:26:57.100 --> 01:27:01.000
The body of Samantha Finley was found 
dead in the arms of his brother. 

01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:07.400
With the news of the death of their children, 
Ellen Finley took his own life in hospital. 

01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:13.800
It is the opinion of the people closest 
Finley family that this video is shown to the public 

01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:20.000
as a final testimony of 
inexplicable and terrible events 
occurred in their Finleys.
