00:04.834 --> 00:06.188
Rejection letters

00:06.189 --> 00:07.542
from acting schools?

00:04.834 --> 00:07.542
From agents?

00:07.584 --> 00:09.792
From old boyfriends?

00:09.834 --> 00:11.167
No, no...

00:11.168 --> 00:12.500
And the boyfriends

00:09.834 --> 00:12.500
usually just stop calling.

00:13.375 --> 00:15.542
No, these are bills!

00:15.584 --> 00:17.018
- You guys have gone
- over your allowance again

00:17.042 --> 00:18.542
Buying ridiculous things.

00:18.584 --> 00:20.272
Hey, buying property

00:20.273 --> 00:21.959
on the moon

00:18.584 --> 00:21.959
is not ridiculous.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.876
It's beach front,

00:23.877 --> 00:25.751
right on the sea

00:22.000 --> 00:25.751
of tranquility.

00:25.792 --> 00:27.335
(SNICKERS)

00:27.336 --> 00:28.876
They saw you coming.

00:28.918 --> 00:30.059
- You're not much better,
- young lady.

00:30.083 --> 00:31.459
Why would you buy

00:31.460 --> 00:32.834
a real Egyptian mummy?

00:32.876 --> 00:34.960
Because when it comes

00:34.961 --> 00:37.042
to dolls, I say,

00:32.876 --> 00:37.042
"Go big, or go home."

00:37.083 --> 00:38.667
- It's not a doll,
- it's a corpse!

00:38.709 --> 00:41.042
Potato, potahto.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.063
You don't say anything

00:43.064 --> 00:45.042
when Bertram buys

00:41.083 --> 00:45.042
stupid opera records.

00:45.083 --> 00:46.480
Bertram can buy

00:46.481 --> 00:47.876
whatever he wants,

00:45.083 --> 00:47.876
no matter how weird.

00:47.918 --> 00:49.480
He is an adult.

00:49.481 --> 00:51.042
Yeah. (BLOWS RASPBERRY)

00:51.083 --> 00:52.209
When he's not acting

00:52.210 --> 00:53.334
like a big baby.

00:53.375 --> 00:55.334
- The point is,
- I work hard for my money,

Waiting on you kids

- Oh, may I have more
- juice, please?

00:59.083 --> 01:01.000
- Get it yourself,
- Queen Latifah's on.

01:02.667 --> 01:03.814
You guys need

01:03.815 --> 01:04.959
to appreciate

01:02.667 --> 01:04.959
how lucky you are.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.522
I have to get a second job

01:06.523 --> 01:08.042
just to afford a nice gift

01:05.000 --> 01:08.042
for my dad's birthday.

01:08.083 --> 01:09.959
Second job?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.668
Don't you think

01:11.669 --> 01:13.334
you should master

01:10.000 --> 01:13.334
this nanny thing first?

01:13.375 --> 01:15.042
- Yeah, if you were
- any good at this,

01:15.083 --> 01:16.876
- I wouldn't be buying
- moon condos.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.834
- How's this little bit
- of nannying?

01:19.876 --> 01:21.418
Until the two of you

01:21.419 --> 01:22.959

03:05.876 --> 03:07.459
- You insist on wearing

03:08.959 --> 03:10.667
- Speaking of sartorial
- matters,

03:10.709 --> 03:12.626
- Jessie, why are you

03:12.667 --> 03:13.751

03:16.399 --> 03:17.918
on a pretty pricey

birthday gift for my dad.

03:17.959 --> 03:19.876
It's a barbecue grill that

What?

03:36.042 --> 03:37.521
Ooh, yay!

Do I get to hold

03:36.042 --> 03:39.000

03:40.083 --> 03:41.918
Sure, knock yourself out.

03:43.709 --> 03:44.751
Good luck

03:44.752 --> 03:45.792
and stand up straight.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.667
- First impressions
- are important.

03:47.709 --> 03:48.917
Two hours ago,

03:48.918 --> 03:50.125
I fished her retainer

03:47.709 --> 03:50.125
out of the toilet.

03:50.167 --> 03:51.167
She owes me.

03:52.542 --> 03:54.918
Please, step into my office.

03:54.959 --> 03:56.251
Ooh, a corner office.

03:56.252 --> 03:57.542
Someone's doing well.

03:58.626 --> 03:59.709
Name?

03:59.751 --> 04:01.542
- Seriously?
- Name?

04:01.584 --> 04:03.500
Jessie Prescott.

04:03.542 --> 04:04.772
Address?

04:04.773 --> 04:06.000
The room right

04:03.542 --> 04:06.000
next to yours?

04:07.167 --> 04:09.084
Hmm, interviewee

04:09.085 --> 04:11.000
displaying signs

04:07.167 --> 04:11.000
of sarcasm.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.042
Might be a red flag.

04:13.667 --> 04:15.083
- Skills?
- Acting.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.563
Jessie, I can't lie

04:16.564 --> 04:18.000
on an official document.

04:19.834 --> 04:21.017
- Have you ever
- committed a crime?

04:21.041 --> 04:22.500
I'm considering one now.

04:24.083 --> 04:25.792
- Do you have
- any references?

04:25.834 --> 04:27.751
Yes. You!

04:27.792 --> 04:28.897
Okay. Hold on, let me

04:28.898 --> 04:30.000
check in with me.

04:32.167 --> 04:33.605
Good news!

04:33.606 --> 04:35.042
It turns out I mostly

04:32.167 --> 04:35.042
think very highly of you

04:35.083 --> 04:36.792
Huh.

04:36.834 --> 04:38.167
Boomer, she's hired!

04:38.209 --> 04:39.626
Great. Welcome

04:39.627 --> 04:41.042
to the team, Jessie.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.522
We've only got

04:42.523 --> 04:43.959
two rules, the customer

04:41.083 --> 04:43.959
is always right...

04:44.000 --> 04:45.022
And never stick

04:45.023 --> 04:46.042
your hand in

04:44.000 --> 04:46.042
the deep fryer.

04:46.083 --> 04:47.563
Who would be stupid

04:47.564 --> 04:49.042
enough to stick their hand

04:46.083 --> 04:49.042
in the deep fryer?

04:49.083 --> 04:51.000
Hey, it was a new watch!

04:55.042 --> 04:56.126
Bye, Mrs. Loman,

04:56.127 --> 04:57.209
I'll give this to Jessie.

04:58.292 --> 04:59.668
Hey, Zuri,

04:59.669 --> 05:01.042
where'd you get the cash?

05:01.083 --> 05:03.042
- Becky's mom told me
- to give it to Jessie

05:03.083 --> 05:04.584
- To thank her
- for the play date.

05:04.626 --> 05:06.584
- Although,
- I did all the playing.

05:07.792 --> 05:08.918
Ouch!

05:08.919 --> 05:10.042
What's the matter?

05:10.083 --> 05:12.000
I think I just got an idea.

05:12.042 --> 05:14.000
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

05:14.042 --> 05:16.059
- But we might have to fudge
- the truth a little bit.

05:16.083 --> 05:17.397
You had me at fudge.

05:17.398 --> 05:18.709
Talk to me.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.897
Maybe we can invite more

05:21.898 --> 05:23.709
of your little friends over,

05:23.751 --> 05:25.334
- say Jessie
- is babysitting them,

05:25.375 --> 05:26.709
Then pocket the cash

05:26.710 --> 05:28.042
to make up for our

05:25.375 --> 05:28.042
lost allowance.

05:28.083 --> 05:30.083
Brilliant! I've got to buy

05:30.084 --> 05:32.083
the new Taylor Swift album.

05:32.125 --> 05:33.542
If you're one

05:33.543 --> 05:34.959
of the first

05:32.125 --> 05:34.959
1,000 downloads,

05:35.000 --> 05:36.522
you get a jar

05:36.523 --> 05:38.042
of her actual tears!

05:38.083 --> 05:40.042
- And Jessie's job
- is so easy.

05:40.083 --> 05:41.397
All she really has to do

05:41.398 --> 05:42.709
is detail the helicopter

05:42.751 --> 05:44.000
and make sure we stay alive.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.834
- Hey, guys.
- Where's Becky?

05:46.876 --> 05:48.143
- Did her mom come
- to pick her up?

05:48.167 --> 05:49.167
Yep. And she told me

05:49.168 --> 05:50.167
to give you...

05:48.167 --> 05:50.167
(CLEARS THROAT)

05:51.083 --> 05:53.000
a big hug!

05:54.792 --> 05:56.043
Aw, that's sweet.

05:56.044 --> 05:57.292
(CHUCKLES)

05:57.334 --> 05:59.000
- But some cash
- would have been nice.

06:02.959 --> 06:04.375
Okay, Ravi.

06:04.417 --> 06:06.168
I have your Adam and Eve

06:06.169 --> 06:07.918
on a raft and I wrecked them.

06:07.959 --> 06:09.167
It's just diner lingo

06:09.168 --> 06:10.375
for two scrambled eggs

06:07.959 --> 06:10.375
on toast.

06:10.417 --> 06:11.793
Oh, thank goodness.

06:11.794 --> 06:13.167
For a moment,

06:10.417 --> 06:13.167
I was very concerned

06:13.209 --> 06:14.959
- for a poor
- shipwrecked couple

06:15.000 --> 06:16.959
- And your impending
- legal entanglements.

06:18.334 --> 06:19.688
Hey, Emma!

06:19.689 --> 06:21.042
Told you I could waitress.

06:18.334 --> 06:21.042
Pretty good, huh?

06:21.083 --> 06:22.751
Definitely!

06:22.792 --> 06:24.834
Only... Oh, never mind.

06:24.876 --> 06:26.167
No, what? Tell me.

06:26.209 --> 06:27.626
Well, we always pre-butter

06:27.627 --> 06:29.042
the toast for our customers.

06:29.083 --> 06:30.459
Well, I've actually found

06:30.460 --> 06:31.834
that people like to butter

06:29.083 --> 06:31.834
their own toast.

06:31.876 --> 06:33.418
Oh, well, that's a nice idea,

06:33.419 --> 06:34.959
but where does it end?

06:35.000 --> 06:36.480
Do you want them

06:36.481 --> 06:37.959
to grow their own corn, too?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.959
Milk their own chicken?

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
What?

06:40.042 --> 06:41.101
- Listen, I know
- what I'm doing.

06:41.125 --> 06:43.042
- I've been waitressing
- a long time and...

06:43.083 --> 06:45.063
You just discovered

06:45.064 --> 06:47.042
that toast isn't made

06:43.083 --> 06:47.042

21:05.792 --> 21:07.209
- By the way,
- where's Bertram?

21:07.250 --> 21:09.000
(GASPS)

21:09.042 --> 21:10.626
ALL: Oh, oh!

21:13.125 --> 21:14.584
(PANTS)

21:14.585 --> 21:16.042
I think I'm allergic

21:13.125 --> 21:16.042
to wool.

21:16.083 --> 21:17.563
(SNEEZES)

21:17.564 --> 21:19.042
And children.

21:19.083 --> 21:20.709
(SOBBING)

21:22.250 --> 21:23.626
"so The Empire

21:23.627 --> 21:25.000
Skate Building

21:22.250 --> 21:25.000
makes my Top Ten List,

21:25.042 --> 21:27.042
"not just for the great food,

21:27.043 --> 21:29.042
but for the caring

21:25.042 --> 21:29.042
family atmosphere.

21:29.083 --> 21:31.042
- "It may not be perfect,
- but what family is?"

21:31.083 --> 21:33.042
- Aw!
- (CHUCKLES)

21:33.083 --> 21:35.042
- So not only did you
- get your great review,

21:35.083 --> 21:36.563
But I made enough money

21:36.564 --> 21:38.042
to buy my dad that

21:35.083 --> 21:38.042
amphibious grill.

21:38.083 --> 21:40.484
- Plus the inflatable - oven mitts that
- Double as floaties.

21:42.042 --> 21:43.810
- I'm really going to miss
- having you work here, Jessie.

21:43.834 --> 21:44.939
Aside from almost

21:44.940 --> 21:46.042
crushing my

21:43.834 --> 21:46.042
professional dreams,

21:46.083 --> 21:48.042
you were a great waitress.

21:48.083 --> 21:49.522
Now luckily, a part of Jessie

21:49.523 --> 21:50.959
will always stay here,

21:51.000 --> 21:52.022
because I made you

21:52.023 --> 21:53.042
Employee of the Month!

21:53.083 --> 21:54.438
(GASPS)

21:54.439 --> 21:55.792
Emma, I'm honored!

21:55.834 --> 21:57.351
- Was I really your
- favorite employee?

21:57.375 --> 21:58.709
Well, you were my

21:58.710 --> 22:00.042
only employee.

22:00.083 --> 22:02.000
- I voted for Emma again.
- But congrats.

22:03.834 --> 22:05.000
Look, Jessie.

22:05.042 --> 22:06.042
Ta-da!

22:08.375 --> 22:10.084
Did you have to use

22:10.085 --> 22:11.792
my driver's license photo?

22:11.834 --> 22:12.897
Good thing I always

22:12.898 --> 22:13.959
carry my headshot with me.
