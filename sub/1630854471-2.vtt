14:52.518 --> 14:54.102
Uh, getting a little low.

14:54.102 --> 14:55.938
- I'll get you some more.
- Great.

14:59.066 --> 15:01.193
I've just been so crazy, you know.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.654

15:08.534 --> 15:10.452

- Good work, Bobby.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.172

15:22.172 --> 15:26.134
Oh, this? Yeah. I'm the owner.

15:26.134 --> 15:27.719
Wow.

15:30.681 --> 15:32.724
Are you having a good time?

15:32.724 --> 15:35.894
Just not my kind of place. No offense.

15:40.274 --> 15:42.150

17:18.372 --> 17:20.165
- See that?
- I don't quite.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.751
The ice. It's-it's...

17:22.751 --> 17:26.088
only filling about
two-thirds of the glass.

17:26.088 --> 17:28.048
Which means, in a 12-ounce glass,

17:28.048 --> 17:30.926
the top third of the glass
contains twice as much alcohol

17:30.926 --> 17:33.178
as it would if there was ice,

17:33.178 --> 17:36.306
which translates to probably
an extra 50 cents' worth of alcohol

17:36.306 --> 17:37.683
per Long Island Iced Tea,

17:37.683 --> 17:39.935
compared to one where
the ice goes to the top.

17:39.935 --> 17:41.770
Multiply that times the number

17:41.770 --> 17:44.815
of Long Island Iced Teas
you serve in a month and that's... ooh...

17:44.815 --> 17:47.526
200 per month times
30 nights times 50 cents...

17:47.526 --> 17:49.194
You're talking monthly lost revenue

17:49.194 --> 17:50.445
on the order of...

17:50.445 --> 17:52.281
$3,000.

17:53.240 --> 17:56.034
And that's just
the Long Island Iced Teas.

17:56.034 --> 17:58.245
You add that to the Dirty Bananas,
the Fuzzy Navels,

17:58.245 --> 18:01.623
the Slippery Nipples,
the Screaming Orgasms...

18:02.708 --> 18:04.418
I bartended in college.

18:06.628 --> 18:07.838
May I?

18:07.838 --> 18:08.964
Uh, yeah.

18:08.964 --> 18:10.465
Um...

18:10.465 --> 18:12.634
Simple solution.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.806
Bigger scoopers. You should have two.

18:17.806 --> 18:19.892
One that holds exactly
enough for a 12-ounce glass,

18:19.892 --> 18:22.227
then a second one
for your 16-ounce drinks,

18:22.227 --> 18:25.439
like... like a jigger, but for ice.

18:25.439 --> 18:28.275
That way your bartender doesn't have
to putz around with multiple scoopers

18:28.275 --> 18:30.611
trying to get the exact right amount
for a certain glass.

18:30.611 --> 18:32.613
It's just "one and done," which you need

18:32.613 --> 18:35.782
in a high-volume situation
where you want maximum efficiency.

18:35.782 --> 18:38.160
I know it sounds crazy, but it would...

18:38.160 --> 18:40.329
make a big difference.

18:40.329 --> 18:42.456
Ballpark?

18:42.456 --> 18:45.751
This one change would boost
your annual bottom line

18:45.751 --> 18:50.047

- What are you getting at?

28:09.064 --> 28:12.317
What I'm getting at is,
why don't they stay here instead?

28:12.985 --> 28:15.028
We don't allow men in the club.

28:15.028 --> 28:16.864
For the show.

28:18.156 --> 28:19.825
But afterwards...

28:19.825 --> 28:22.077
If we let in men after the show...

28:22.077 --> 28:23.662
The women would stay.

28:23.662 --> 28:25.539
We could stay open for hours,
as late as we want.

28:25.539 --> 28:26.999
Men would be happy
to pay a premium

28:26.999 --> 28:28.959
for access to a room
full of sexually eager women.

28:28.959 --> 28:30.711
- Definitely.
- Imagine the extra revenue.

28:30.711 --> 28:33.172
I mean, we're not talking
a 10% boost to the bottom line,

28:33.172 --> 28:35.007

28:35.007 --> 28:37.301

31:40.984 --> 31:42.361
Mm-hmm.

31:46.657 --> 31:48.450
But that 15%, you know.

31:48.450 --> 31:51.828
- She used to make this?
- All the time.

31:53.497 --> 31:55.165
When my father and I would work late,

31:55.165 --> 31:57.084
she would bring
a big tin of it downstairs.

31:57.084 --> 31:58.627
Downstairs?

31:58.627 --> 32:00.170
To the printing press.

32:00.170 --> 32:01.797
Um, that was the family business.

32:01.797 --> 32:03.674
I used to help out.

32:03.674 --> 32:05.384
Was that what your dad did?

32:05.384 --> 32:07.761
- He still does.
- Yeah?

32:07.761 --> 32:10.556
Come from four generations of printers.

32:10.556 --> 32:13.350
Three generations of
aluminum siding suppliers.

32:13.350 --> 32:14.935
- No kidding.
- Mm-hmm.

32:14.935 --> 32:18.438
It's a... it's a bit
of a point of contention.

32:18.438 --> 32:19.898
How so?

32:19.898 --> 32:21.817
I'm kind of the black sheep
of the family.

32:21.817 --> 32:24.403
Of my four siblings, I'm the only one
who didn't sign on.

32:24.403 --> 32:27.281
When I graduated UW
with my accounting degree,

32:27.281 --> 32:30.075
the assumption was I would work there,

32:30.075 --> 32:31.618
spend my life doing the books

32:31.618 --> 32:34.580
for good old Tychowsky Aluminum Siding.

32:36.331 --> 32:37.374
But...

32:39.585 --> 32:42.171
It's not what I wanted to do.

32:42.171 --> 32:45.299
I didn't want to be the accountant
for the family business.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.928
I wanted to be a Hollywood accountant.

32:51.138 --> 32:53.390
I know, it's silly.

32:53.390 --> 32:55.309
- No, it's...
- Yeah.

32:55.309 --> 32:57.394
So, on my 22nd birthday, I packed my bags

32:57.394 --> 33:00.689
and I hopped on an Amtrak
bound for Los Angeles.

33:01.440 --> 33:02.858
When I got there,

33:02.858 --> 33:06.361
I applied to every movie studio
and talent agency in town,

33:06.361 --> 33:07.863
and eventually I landed a job

33:07.863 --> 33:11.074
in the accounting department
of Warner Bros.

33:11.074 --> 33:12.492
Warner Bros.?

33:12.492 --> 33:14.161
It was thrilling!

33:14.161 --> 33:16.205
I would see movie stars all the time,

33:16.205 --> 33:20.167
shooting stuff, coming onto the lot
to take meetings.

33:20.167 --> 33:21.919
One time...

33:21.919 --> 33:23.754
I, um...

33:23.754 --> 33:26.632
I helped Linda Carter find the bathroom.

33:26.632 --> 33:29.426
- Wonder Woman?
- I know, right?

33:29.426 --> 33:31.887
She didn't know where it was, so I...

33:31.887 --> 33:33.805
took her to it.

33:33.805 --> 33:36.308
Did you say anything? Did you say,
"I love Wonder Woman"?

33:36.308 --> 33:37.643
I got so nervous.

33:37.643 --> 33:40.562
I just said, "I hope it goes well."

33:43.815 --> 33:45.651
Soon after that, I got laid off,

33:45.651 --> 33:48.445
and, uh... I couldn't
find an accounting job

33:48.445 --> 33:50.614
in Hollywood anywhere.

33:50.614 --> 33:52.032
Then I got desperate

33:52.032 --> 33:55.035
and took one with a landscaping company.

33:57.955 --> 34:02.251
Missed the glamour and the excitement.

I can fetch coffee.

39:58.524 --> 40:01.276
I mean, I'm... I'm a vision facilitator.

40:01.276 --> 40:03.904
- Oh.
- A costume designer.

40:03.904 --> 40:07.074
Especially costume designer.
- You're a costume designer?

40:07.074 --> 40:09.284
Yeah, I'm a receptionist by trade,

40:09.284 --> 40:11.495
but I... fashion's my passion.

40:11.495 --> 40:12.788
- You don't say?
- Yes.

40:12.788 --> 40:15.249
I custom stud.

40:15.249 --> 40:18.043
I appliqué jackets, capes.

40:18.043 --> 40:20.128
I even had my own clothing line,

40:20.128 --> 40:21.547
um, for a while.

40:21.547 --> 40:23.715
- Your own line?
- Yeah.

40:23.715 --> 40:27.010
I'm a fucking magician
with a sewing machine.

40:27.010 --> 40:29.555
I could make the craziest
shit for this place,

40:29.555 --> 40:32.099
which you could use.

40:33.433 --> 40:35.227
Oh, really?

40:35.227 --> 40:37.187
And what's that supposed to mean?

40:37.187 --> 40:39.773
Oh... I mean, uh...

40:39.773 --> 40:42.109
the costumes are, hmm...

40:42.109 --> 40:43.986
- Excuse me?
- They're the weak link.

40:43.986 --> 40:46.864
- Really?
- They're just so... generic.

40:46.864 --> 40:48.365
It's expensive shit.

40:48.365 --> 40:50.158
It's expensive <i>shit.</i>

40:50.158 --> 40:52.077
It's not innovative.

40:52.077 --> 40:54.413
It's not original, it's not unique.

40:54.413 --> 40:57.291
You need that "wow" factor,
like the rest of the show.

40:57.291 --> 41:01.295
Oh, that you can provide
with your stud gun.

41:01.295 --> 41:03.672
You leave me no choice.

41:10.220 --> 41:12.556
Yum. Let me borrow you.

41:14.433 --> 41:15.893
Looking good, Richie.

41:15.893 --> 41:17.978
Ooh, Richie! Fancy.

41:17.978 --> 41:22.858
I can't tell you how many times
I've had a stripper in my face

41:22.858 --> 41:26.028
and I couldn't get his pants off,

41:26.028 --> 41:29.448
because the problem is
you can't get them off over his shoes.

41:29.448 --> 41:31.533
It's a major pain in the ass.

41:31.533 --> 41:35.579
Not to mention, as a performance aspect,

41:35.579 --> 41:38.457
it's not very slick, it's not sexy.

41:38.457 --> 41:40.250
You're fumbling around.

41:40.250 --> 41:44.796
But fortunately I came up with a solution.

41:44.796 --> 41:47.007
Presenting...

41:51.637 --> 41:53.013
Whoo!

41:56.225 --> 41:57.559
Breakaway pants.

41:57.559 --> 41:59.269
Hey-oh!

42:01.813 --> 42:03.148
Those should be the mugs?

42:03.148 --> 42:06.109
Oh, no, these are the T-shirts.
I think those are the mugs.

42:06.109 --> 42:08.070
We are hiring this woman.

42:09.321 --> 42:11.114
Hi. Denise Coughlan.

42:11.114 --> 42:13.325
Medical receptionist, FIT dropout.

42:13.325 --> 42:16.745
She's a costume designer
and stone-cold genius.

42:16.745 --> 42:18.247
Fucking breakaway pants.

42:19.081 --> 42:20.582
Game changer.

42:22.543 --> 42:25.045
I'm sorry, I can't add
another salary to payroll.

42:25.045 --> 42:27.172
We need her, I need her.

42:28.423 --> 42:29.758
The answer is no.

42:29.758 --> 42:31.510
So let me get this straight.

42:31.510 --> 42:34.680
You steal my best dancer--
- I did not steal anybody.

42:37.057 --> 42:38.642
Bring her on or I walk.

42:40.185 --> 42:41.770
Is that a threat?

42:43.355 --> 42:44.940
It's a promise.

42:49.653 --> 42:51.071
We should hire her.

42:51.572 --> 42:53.407
Costumes, alterations, cleaning.

42:53.407 --> 42:54.908
We outsource all of that.

42:54.908 --> 42:56.410
If we had someone in house,

42:56.410 --> 42:58.203
that would probably save us...

42:58.203 --> 42:59.913
a fortune in the long run.

42:59.913 --> 43:02.833
Besides, it would be nice
to have another girl around.

43:05.210 --> 43:07.212
- Hmm.
- Well...

43:07.212 --> 43:08.839
what do you say, Steve?

43:16.305 --> 43:18.182
Only because it makes financial sense.

43:18.182 --> 43:21.560
Ah! Only because it makes...

43:21.560 --> 43:24.062
This is the best decision
you've ever made.

43:24.062 --> 43:27.107
I'm not gonna let you down... sir!

43:27.107 --> 43:29.568
Sister!
- Oh!

43:29.568 --> 43:30.819
Oh...

43:32.279 --> 43:33.363
This is it.

43:34.865 --> 43:36.575
This is the team.

43:37.284 --> 43:39.953
Oh, you know,
these are really beautiful.

43:39.953 --> 43:41.121
Thank you.

45:12.504 --> 45:13.672
<i>He's crazy.</i>

45:13.672 --> 45:15.382
I'm sorry you feel that way.

45:15.382 --> 45:18.093
The only thing that makes
this place special is what we bring to it.

45:18.093 --> 45:20.262
We should quit.
We should start our own place.

45:20.262 --> 45:21.889
We're opening a Chippendales in New York.

45:21.889 --> 45:23.640
- Excuse me?
- And I'm gonna run it.

45:23.640 --> 45:25.642
<i>The way I see it, you've got two choices.</i>

45:25.642 --> 45:30.022
<i>You and me stick together
and take the Big Apple by storm!</i>

45:30.772 --> 45:34.860
Or... you and me go to war.

45:35.611 --> 45:37.738
<i>I want you to repeat after me:</i>

45:37.738 --> 45:40.032
"Things are going incredibly well."

45:41.408 --> 45:42.743
Things are going incredibly well.

45:43.327 --> 45:46.163
"Business is booming."
- Business is booming.

45:46.163 --> 45:49.124
You cannot launch
a competing Chippendales tour!

45:49.124 --> 45:50.375
But, Nick, I just did.

45:51.585 --> 45:54.171
<i>"My company was just featured
on national television."</i>

45:54.171 --> 45:57.633
<i>Mr. Chippendales himself,
Nick De Noia!</i>

45:57.633 --> 45:59.635
<i>My company was just featured
on national television.</i>

46:00.511 --> 46:03.263
And I'm not gonna blow it
on some silly little slight.

46:05.474 --> 46:06.558
Say it.

46:08.101 --> 46:11.897
<i>We're being sued for
racially discriminatory practices.</i>

46:11.897 --> 46:14.525
<i>In business,
there's only one color that matters.</i>

46:14.525 --> 46:16.944
<i>Heavy is the head
that wears the crown, right?</i>

46:16.944 --> 46:19.404
Gotta keep 'em in line,
or they're gonna walk all over you.

46:19.404 --> 46:21.657
- I could kill him.
- Not if I beat you to it.

46:23.492 --> 46:25.953
<i>I am the owner, president, and CEO</i>

46:25.953 --> 46:28.580
of Chippendales Enterprises Incorporated,
I am!

46:29.581 --> 46:32.835
Everybody is trying to profit
off what I built, my hard work.

46:32.835 --> 46:34.753
<i>You are a good person!</i>

46:34.753 --> 46:36.463
We don't do things like this.

46:36.463 --> 46:39.174
<i>I am the boss! This is my club!</i>

46:39.174 --> 46:41.593
<i>And you are my employee!</i>

46:41.593 --> 46:43.679
Is that clear?

46:46.598 --> 46:48.851
May I ask why the FBI is involved?
