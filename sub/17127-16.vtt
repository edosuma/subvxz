00:18.749 --> 00:23.154

 WHAT´S WRONG WITH IT?

00:23.154 --> 00:26.427

00:35.506 --> 00:37.238

 IN LOS ANGELES.

01:36.567 --> 01:38.399

01:38.399 --> 01:40.271
THESE WERE THE ONLY
 THREE SCHOOLS

01:40.271 --> 01:41.472
THAT WOULD EVEN
 CONSIDER HER.

01:41.472 --> 01:42.803
HOW MUCH IS IT?

OVER 5 GRAND,
 WE BUY HER HEELS, A SKIRT,

01:52.783 --> 01:55.546

02:00.321 --> 02:01.622

02:01.622 --> 02:03.724
FOR $100, I CAN BUY HER
 A FAKE I.D.,

02:03.724 --> 02:06.497

 SERVING COCKTAILS.

02:07.658 --> 02:08.899

THAT IS A COPY,
 GEORGE,

09:29.239 --> 09:33.844
OF YOUR...
 BIRTH...CERTIFICATE.

09:33.844 --> 09:36.106
WHY IS IT A COPY?

09:36.106 --> 09:39.980
BECAUSE WHEN YOUR DAD LEFT US,
 HE STOLE THE ORIGINAL.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.151
SO IS THIS THE ORIGINAL?

09:41.151 --> 09:46.016
OH, MY GOD.
 YEAH, THAT´S IT.

09:46.016 --> 09:50.621

 STOP DRINKING

10:02.332 --> 10:06.006
YOU KNOW WHAT? I BET YOUR DAD
 SOLD IT TO THIS GUY´S DAD.

10:06.006 --> 10:09.680
MY DAD DIDN´T BUY ANYONE ELSE´S
 BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

10:09.680 --> 10:14.084
SO I SUPPOSE YOUR DAD´S NAME IS
 MANNY LOPEZ, TOO.

10:14.084 --> 10:16.216
YEAH, IT IS.

10:16.216 --> 10:19.219

10:27.758 --> 10:28.899
OH, MAN.

10:28.899 --> 10:30.731
DO YOU KNOW
 WHAT THIS MEANS?

10:30.731 --> 10:35.335
THAT YOUR FATHER NEVER LEARNED
 HOW TO USE A DAMN CONDOM.

10:39.069 --> 10:42.913
HE HAD ANOTHER SON, MOM.

10:42.913 --> 10:46.176
WE´RE HALF BROTHERS.

10:46.176 --> 10:49.119
I GOT A HALF BROTHER?

10:49.119 --> 10:50.320
WOW.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.322
HEY, WHY DON´T YOU FIND
 THREE MORE

10:52.322 --> 10:54.825
AND MAYBE YOU CAN BE
 ON "FAMILY FEUD"?

10:57.657 --> 11:00.791
I´M NOT RELATED TO HER,
 RIGHT?

11:00.791 --> 11:03.864
ALREADY I´M JEALOUS
 OF YOU.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.440
MY MOM TOLD ME
 MY DAD WAS DEAD.

11:10.440 --> 11:12.372
THEN I FOUND OUT HE WAS ALIVE
 FROM AUNT CECILIA,

11:12.372 --> 11:14.875
AND I´VE BEEN LOOKING FOR HIM
 EVERYWHERE, MAN --

11:14.875 --> 11:17.447
ON THE INTERNET, I RAN ADS
 IN A BUNCH OF NEWSPAPERS.

11:17.447 --> 11:20.310
ANGIE EVEN CALLED EVERY
 MANNY LOPEZ IN CALIFORNIA,

11:20.310 --> 11:21.852
BUT HE´S IMPOSSIBLE
 TO FIND.

11:21.852 --> 11:25.155
OH, HE´S IN PHOENIX.
 HE´S IN THE BOOK.

11:25.155 --> 11:28.058
AND SO ENDS
 A 35-YEAR JOURNEY.

11:28.058 --> 11:29.459
WHO WANTS PUDDING?

11:29.459 --> 11:33.894
IF GEORGE´S FATHER NEEDED
 A BIRTH CERTIFICATE
