00:33.880 --> 00:35.630
<i>Cell.</i>

00:36.760 --> 00:38.942
<i>Prison cell.</i>

00:39.760 --> 00:41.862
<i>How'd I get here?</i>

00:42.320 --> 00:45.151
<i>What you want, son? What you want?</i>

00:46.440 --> 00:49.111
- I want my mama.
- Your mama?

00:49.800 --> 00:53.143
Walker, let's get out of here.
I want to talk to you.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.190
I want to talk to you,
Walker. It's important.

00:56.480 --> 00:59.311
Come on, Walker. Come on.

01:02.080 --> 01:04.831
- Now, you listen to me, Walker!
- Hey.

01:04.959 --> 01:08.906
I need your help. Don't you
understand? I need your help.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.268
What are you doing?

01:13.400 --> 01:16.663
<i>Walker, they use the prison.</i>

01:16.800 --> 01:20.507
<i>You know, it's closed.
We just wait.</i>

01:20.640 --> 01:24.665
<i>We wait till they get it. And
then we take it from them.</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:30.024
Now, you take the stuff.
I'll get the lights.

01:30.280 --> 01:33.623
<i>- You're my friend, Walker.
- My friend.</i>

01:33.720 --> 01:37.506
<i>- I can't make it on my own.
- Help my friend.</i>

01:37.600 --> 01:39.668
- Trust me.
- What are we doing?

01:39.760 --> 01:42.306
- What are we doing here?
- Trust me. Help me.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.031
I hear it.

01:44.520 --> 01:46.224
Early.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.665
Hit them.

02:00.040 --> 02:03.906
<i>I owe a bundle to some guys. They're
going to kill me if I don't get it.</i>

02:04.000 --> 02:07.866
They're going to kill me if I don't get
it, Walker. They're going to kill me.

02:29.760 --> 02:32.022
<i>We just hit him on the
head, and that's it.</i>

02:32.120 --> 02:34.905
It's simple. We knock him
on the head and that's it.

02:55.600 --> 02:58.544
- Hey!
- Walker!

03:00.440 --> 03:03.305
- We made it.
- We blew it.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.422
<i>We blew it.</i>

03:12.720 --> 03:16.950
- Ten, 20...
- Twenty-four, 2000 in 20s.

03:17.040 --> 03:20.622
- Come on, let's get out of here.
- Will you shut up? I'm trying to count.

03:23.440 --> 03:25.349
You coming, Lynne?

03:25.760 --> 03:27.862
The boat won't be here for an hour.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.310
Lynne.

03:31.760 --> 03:35.387
- Darling.
- It's not as much as I thought.

03:36.080 --> 03:38.148
Is it less than you need?

03:40.480 --> 03:42.742
You better take care
of your husband.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.191
How did we get into this mess?

03:53.920 --> 03:55.784
I don't know.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.310
Lynne.

04:25.720 --> 04:27.424
Come here.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.462
Take me away.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.749
<i>Did it happen?</i>

04:58.800 --> 05:00.504
<i>A dream?</i>

05:01.720 --> 05:03.549
<i>A dream.</i>

06:56.000 --> 06:58.421
<i>As we get closer to Alcatraz...</i>

06:58.560 --> 07:01.345
<i>notice the treacherous
currents around the island...</i>

07:01.480 --> 07:04.311
<i>rendering it virtually
escape-proof.</i>

07:04.440 --> 07:08.340
<i>The water temperature is
usually around 50 degrees.</i>

07:08.440 --> 07:11.623
<i>In its 29 years as a
federal penitentiary...</i>

07:11.720 --> 07:15.267
<i>the one thing that obsessed its
prisoners and plagued its wardens...</i>

07:15.360 --> 07:17.383
<i>was escape.</i>

07:17.520 --> 07:21.625
<i>In 1936, the first escape attempt
was made by a prisoner...</i>

07:21.720 --> 07:24.630
<i>who was almost into the bay
before he was discovered.</i>

07:24.720 --> 07:29.382
<i>In 1937, two prisoners
actually got off the island.</i>

07:29.480 --> 07:32.186
<i>Because of the dense fog
and strong tides...</i>

07:32.280 --> 07:35.224
<i>it is assumed that they
were washed out to sea.</i>

07:35.320 --> 07:37.502
<i>There has never been a
trace of them found.</i>

07:37.640 --> 07:40.505
<i>On June 12th, 1962...</i>

07:40.640 --> 07:45.268
<i>three men dug their way out of the
cell block using small teaspoons.</i>

07:45.400 --> 07:48.663
<i>They left dummies, which they
had created in their cells...</i>

07:48.760 --> 07:50.703
<i>and managed to get off the island.</i>

07:50.800 --> 07:52.709
<i>They have never been
heard of since.</i>

07:52.800 --> 07:54.584
How did you make it, Walker?

07:54.680 --> 07:59.661
<i>In 1946, the historic "Battle
of Alcatraz" took place.</i>

08:00.360 --> 08:03.430
<i>Two convicts had managed
to overpower their guards...</i>

08:03.480 --> 08:08.711
<i>and took over the main cell block
releasing those prisoners still in cells.</i>

08:08.840 --> 08:11.227
<i>They had nine hostages.</i>

08:11.320 --> 08:13.707
<i>During the two days of
siege, the Coast Guard...</i>

08:13.840 --> 08:15.305
Using "The Rock"...

08:15.400 --> 08:18.663
<i>- ...and the San Francisco Police...</i>
- ...for a drop.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.544
<i>- ...a detachment of Marines...</i>
- Fuzz.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.545
<i>- ...guarded the prisoners still in the...</i>
- I'm Yost.

08:23.880 --> 08:25.948
Are you making a charge?

08:26.040 --> 08:28.347
No, no, no.

08:28.720 --> 08:31.141
I want something else.

08:31.480 --> 08:35.140
<i>...the police riddled with
rifle and shotgun fire.</i>

08:35.360 --> 08:40.751
<i>After the 48-hour break, two officers
and three prisoners were dead.</i>

08:40.840 --> 08:45.343
I... I want the organization.

08:45.440 --> 08:47.463
<i>The last escape attempt
from Alcatraz...</i>

08:47.560 --> 08:49.662
Your friend Reese?

08:50.240 --> 08:53.184
He's in the big time now.

08:53.920 --> 08:55.670
Suits...

08:57.680 --> 08:59.782
penthouses.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.026
He bought his way back in...

09:07.880 --> 09:09.709
with the money he stole from you.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.664
<i>None were ever heard from again.</i>

09:11.760 --> 09:15.342
<i>And all indications point to their
being swept with the tide...</i>

09:15.440 --> 09:18.942
<i>out through the Golden
Gate to a watery grave.</i>

09:19.040 --> 09:22.303
<i>Alcatraz, often
called "The Rock"...</i>

09:22.400 --> 09:25.629
<i>- ...was actually privately...</i>
- Ninety-three thousand, wasn't it?

09:25.720 --> 09:29.302
- Ninety-three.
- Ninety-three.

09:29.640 --> 09:31.663
You want Reese...

09:32.200 --> 09:34.189
and I want the organization.

09:34.240 --> 09:36.468
<i>Workman was supposed to
establish a light...</i>

09:36.520 --> 09:38.349
You understand?

09:38.440 --> 09:40.383
<i>...protection to the
ships and small...</i>

09:40.480 --> 09:43.663
I'm going to help you. And
you're going to help me.

09:43.760 --> 09:45.862
<i>The island was eventually sold...</i>

09:45.960 --> 09:48.267
That's your wife's
address in Los Angeles.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.425
<i>- ...for the sum of $5000 in 1849.</i>
- Reese lives there too.

09:52.520 --> 09:58.343
<i>In 1854, the United States Army
began to fortify Alcatraz.</i>

12:04.640 --> 12:06.344
Walker, Reese isn't here.

12:06.440 --> 12:08.269
He's gone.

12:09.160 --> 12:11.228
Three months ago.

12:11.480 --> 12:14.106
Gone. Cold.

12:14.280 --> 12:16.030
Moved out.

12:18.080 --> 12:19.705
Walker.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.507
I'm glad you're not dead.

12:23.000 --> 12:25.785
It's true. I really am.

12:26.400 --> 12:28.468
You ought to kill me.

12:30.160 --> 12:32.183
I can't sleep.

12:32.560 --> 12:34.549
Haven't slept.

12:34.840 --> 12:37.147
I keep taking pills.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.422
I dream about you.

12:41.160 --> 12:43.547
How good it must be...

12:43.640 --> 12:45.583
being dead.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.350
Is it?

12:50.120 --> 12:51.665
No.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.943
No, I can't.

12:54.800 --> 12:57.346
I never had the courage.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.304
This?

13:03.360 --> 13:05.588
Payoff, I guess.

13:07.400 --> 13:10.265
I don't know where he
is, I really don't.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.190
Money?

13:21.720 --> 13:24.790
A guy brings it the
first of every month.

13:25.040 --> 13:26.710
A thousand.

13:28.080 --> 13:29.864
A thousand.

13:31.240 --> 13:35.186
Always a different guy.
No contact with Mal.

13:38.240 --> 13:41.310
Just couldn't make
it with you, Walker.

13:42.840 --> 13:45.022
With him, it was...

13:46.280 --> 13:48.348
kind of fun.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.341
Just drifted into it.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.901
That night on Alcatraz...

13:58.600 --> 14:01.385
I knew it was you I really wanted.

14:03.440 --> 14:05.622
I found out too late.

14:19.680 --> 14:23.990
<i>Do you remember when we met?</i>

14:25.200 --> 14:26.904
<i>The rain?</i>

14:40.280 --> 14:42.382
<i>You were a little drunk.</i>

14:42.880 --> 14:44.823
<i>So was I.</i>

14:46.840 --> 14:49.307
<i>You were funny when you were drunk.</i>

14:53.800 --> 14:55.584
<i>Strange.</i>

14:56.320 --> 14:58.787
<i>I don't remember very much...</i>

15:00.080 --> 15:01.909
<i>but suddenly...</i>

15:02.760 --> 15:04.783
<i>we were together.</i>

15:05.360 --> 15:07.986
<i>It was wonderful at first.</i>

15:09.640 --> 15:11.469
<i>I loved you.</i>

15:12.720 --> 15:14.982
<i>Then, Mal happened.</i>

15:16.200 --> 15:18.268
<i>You talked a lot about Mal.</i>

15:23.480 --> 15:25.184
<i>Mal Reese.</i>

15:25.320 --> 15:28.629
<i>He was very real for
me, until I met him.</i>

15:29.040 --> 15:31.666
<i>That night, at the reunion...</i>

15:31.960 --> 15:35.269
<i>when you found Mal again
and brought him home.</i>

15:39.360 --> 15:41.622
<i>The two of you together.</i>

15:42.720 --> 15:45.221
<i>Then it was the three of us.</i>

15:45.880 --> 15:47.630
<i>Laughing.</i>

15:47.960 --> 15:49.664
<i>It was...</i>

15:51.280 --> 15:53.587
<i>It was perfect.</i>

15:54.440 --> 15:55.951
<i>And...</i>

15:57.040 --> 16:00.667
<i>I think I was happier then,
than any other time.</i>

16:00.760 --> 16:04.751
<i>I seemed to be floating
between the two of you.</i>

16:05.120 --> 16:08.429
<i>Suddenly, I began to
drift toward Mal.</i>

16:08.680 --> 16:10.544
<i>And I...</i>

16:10.720 --> 16:12.470
<i>I just went with him.</i>

21:53.840 --> 21:55.351
<i>Lynne.</i>

21:55.440 --> 21:57.190
<i>Come here.</i>

22:04.480 --> 22:07.311
Hey, come on. I got
something nice for you.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.863
Hey. Who...? Listen.

22:22.040 --> 22:25.110
- "Only Miss Walker," they said.
- "'Only Miss Walker, ' they said."

22:25.160 --> 22:28.343
- I gotta call them.
- You gotta call them.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.065
No.

22:30.200 --> 22:31.586
- I can't.
- You can't...?

22:31.680 --> 22:34.750
- Because they'll kill me.
- They'll kill you?

22:34.840 --> 22:38.740
- Yeah. Big John will kill me.
- Big John?

22:39.280 --> 22:41.587
John Stegman. Big John's Car Lot.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.942
This guy's got a car lot.

22:45.920 --> 22:47.431
Stegman.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.386
What's the dog's name?

22:50.480 --> 22:51.866
- Lola.
- Lola?

22:51.920 --> 22:54.540
- Yes. She's a girl.
- Your dog's name is Lola.

22:54.560 --> 22:56.947
- What's your name?
- Miss Stewart.

22:57.320 --> 22:59.821
Well, Miss Stewart, what
do you think of this car?

22:59.920 --> 23:02.068
- Oh, I like it very much.
- It's a good buy.

23:02.160 --> 23:04.422
A one-owner car, a lady
from Beverly Hills...

23:04.880 --> 23:08.063
- Mr. Stegman?
- Yes, sir.

23:08.240 --> 23:10.229
That's me.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.630
- I'm looking for a car.
- Take your pick, friend.

23:13.680 --> 23:16.306
- What have you got in mind?
- I like a clean model...

23:16.360 --> 23:17.746
What'd you say?

23:19.280 --> 23:21.030
What about this one?

23:21.120 --> 23:24.269
Beautiful car. Beautiful car.

23:24.400 --> 23:27.583
- It costs a lot of money.
- I've got a lot of money.

23:27.680 --> 23:29.740
- Yes, but...
- Every pretty girl that comes in...

23:29.760 --> 23:32.306
right away I'm giving a car away.
What kind do you want?

23:32.400 --> 23:36.710
- Somebody recommend you?
- Mal Reese.

23:37.840 --> 23:42.070
- Good. You wanna take a spin?
- Okay.

23:45.560 --> 23:48.550
Aren't you going to introduce
this lovely lady to your boss?

23:48.640 --> 23:50.549
Yes, sir. This is my boss.

23:50.640 --> 23:53.391
- Well, hello.
- How do you do? Glad to meet you.

23:56.280 --> 23:59.748
You ready to go for a little spin?

23:59.880 --> 24:02.187
- She's committed herself.
- Where shall we go?

24:02.280 --> 24:04.269
- Anywhere you say.
- I know.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.543
- Let's go to the beach.
- Great.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.702
I've got to go. I'll
be back in 20 minutes.

24:10.840 --> 24:12.669
- Good.
- Okay.

24:12.920 --> 24:14.988
- Don't go away.
- Don't worry.

24:15.080 --> 24:17.342
- I'll be right back.
- Yes.

24:23.680 --> 24:27.466
- Fall in love?
- Yeah. Pretty nice rig, eh?

24:29.680 --> 24:31.623
You don't really need that.

24:31.720 --> 24:34.630
Most accidents happen
within three miles of home.

24:34.720 --> 24:36.106
True. True.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.183
Well, what do you want for it?

24:38.280 --> 24:42.271
See if you like it, and we'll
work out a deal. Okay?

24:45.360 --> 24:47.542
It's the headlight, electric.
Kind that flop over.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.748
- Yeah.
- Take a look, right up that line...

24:49.880 --> 24:52.221
and picture yourself
behind that wheel.

24:52.640 --> 24:56.301
- Mind if I hear my commercial?
- No. Go right ahead.

24:57.440 --> 24:59.190
Stereo. Pretty good, huh?

24:59.280 --> 25:02.270
How's the power steering work, huh?

25:02.360 --> 25:04.940
Hey. Get it over.

25:05.360 --> 25:07.428
Are you crazy?

25:10.760 --> 25:13.431
- Where can I find Reese?
- What's he got to do with this?

25:13.520 --> 25:16.220
- What are you doing to my car?
- What I did to your delivery boy.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.382
- What are you talking about?
- Tell me.

25:18.480 --> 25:21.709
I can't tell you. I can't think.

25:24.400 --> 25:26.104
Stop it.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.384
Stop it.

25:36.320 --> 25:38.184
Stop it.

25:45.920 --> 25:48.068
- Who the hell are you?
- My name's Walker.

25:48.160 --> 25:52.151
- Where do I find Reese?
- I've got nothing to do with Reese.

25:57.800 --> 26:01.507
I know about you, Walker.
How's your wife?

26:04.800 --> 26:06.823
- She'd dead.
- And her sister?

26:06.960 --> 26:09.222
Chris? What about her?

26:16.160 --> 26:17.989
She's with Reese now.

26:18.080 --> 26:20.581
He nailed both sisters.

26:22.800 --> 26:24.664
How does that grab you?

26:24.760 --> 26:26.749
Where's Reese?

26:29.960 --> 26:32.904
<i>Big John loves cars.
Come on in. Pay us a visit.</i>

26:33.000 --> 26:35.023
- Get up.
<i>- We've got a 1960, four-door...</i>

26:35.080 --> 26:37.103
Where's Chris?

26:37.240 --> 26:39.024
She runs a club.

26:39.120 --> 26:41.826
A place called the Movie House.

26:41.960 --> 26:45.428
<i>Unconditionally and fully guaranteed.
You'll love my guarantee.</i>

26:45.520 --> 26:48.271
<i>Now come on in. Come on
in to Big John's Car Lot.</i>

26:48.360 --> 26:51.270
<i>Remember, Big John loves cars.
You'll love my guarantee.</i>

26:51.360 --> 26:54.191
<i>You'll love my cars at Big John's.</i>

27:35.320 --> 27:37.866
Did I exaggerate, hm?

27:38.440 --> 27:41.225
- He did that, huh?
- With me, in it.

27:41.360 --> 27:43.508
- You're sure it was him?
- It was him.

27:43.640 --> 27:47.222
- Tall? Big man?
- I know him, Mal.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.421
- You didn't tell him anything?
- I didn't.

27:53.560 --> 27:56.709
- Now, would I tell him anything.
- You sure you told him nothing.

27:56.800 --> 27:59.426
This says I didn't, and
this says I didn't.

27:59.520 --> 28:02.146
- Then why didn't he kill you?
- He killed the car.

28:02.280 --> 28:04.667
You didn't give him
something? A name?

28:04.760 --> 28:07.067
I told him you were in Frisco.

28:07.880 --> 28:09.948
Smart boy.

28:11.240 --> 28:13.024
Just don't hold out on me.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.711
You can trust me, Mal.

28:17.800 --> 28:20.790
You had him, and you let him go.
Now, find him again.

28:21.480 --> 28:24.060
- Find him?
- I don't care how you do it. Just do it.

28:24.840 --> 28:27.591
- Mal, come on.
- Shut up.

28:28.880 --> 28:30.948
Now, you find him.

28:31.040 --> 28:32.824
You finish him.

29:29.160 --> 29:33.310
- How are you, Sandy?
- Walker. You still alive?

29:33.400 --> 29:35.423
Are you?

29:46.280 --> 29:49.782
- Where's Chris?
- She's off tonight.

29:49.880 --> 29:53.029
Write down her address for me, huh?

29:54.320 --> 29:58.061
- Thought I'd see you.
- Oh, why?

29:58.160 --> 30:01.707
Some guy, asking for you.

30:06.040 --> 30:08.427
Is there another way
out of this joint?

30:08.520 --> 30:10.907
Back of the stage.

30:11.480 --> 30:13.344
Sandra.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.546
See you around, huh?

30:17.120 --> 30:18.904
Do.

33:39.960 --> 33:41.630
Walker.

33:43.880 --> 33:45.869
Where's Reese?

33:50.080 --> 33:52.467
You're supposed to be
dead. Lynne said so.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.344
She's dead.

33:55.240 --> 33:56.865
Lynne.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.991
- You?
- No, her.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.104
- Those.
- I'm not sleeping.

34:04.720 --> 34:08.347
- I heard you're running with Reese.
- Well, you heard wrong.

34:08.480 --> 34:10.503
Does he want you?

34:10.600 --> 34:13.670
- Sure he does.
- Do you want him?

34:13.800 --> 34:17.824
- He makes my flesh crawl.
- I want him.

34:19.719 --> 34:22.426
You were always the
best thing about Lynne.

34:22.520 --> 34:24.668
Why don't you want him?

34:27.040 --> 34:29.984
I don't want any of them, Walker.

34:31.159 --> 34:33.739
I was going with a guy...

34:33.960 --> 34:35.902
who owned a club. Jazz club.

34:35.960 --> 34:39.587
- Yeah, the Movie House.
- It was different then.

34:40.800 --> 34:42.902
It was a good jazz club.

34:43.000 --> 34:48.789
The organization wanted to...
Wanted to become his partner.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.550
And...

34:50.639 --> 34:52.788
- And?
- And he...

34:54.920 --> 34:56.670
Killed him.

34:58.960 --> 35:01.984
I run it. I run the club now.

35:02.560 --> 35:05.743
Oh, boy, do I pay him.

35:07.720 --> 35:11.142
- You know, I loved him.
- Why?

35:11.880 --> 35:13.550
Pay.

35:14.200 --> 35:15.631
Gotta make a living.

35:16.760 --> 35:18.828
The organization.

35:18.920 --> 35:21.421
And Mal Reese.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.580
What do you want from me, Walker?

35:32.880 --> 35:36.223
Reese. He owes me money.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.102
Lynne and money.

35:44.120 --> 35:46.188
Fix your face.

35:49.200 --> 35:51.302
I've got room, you can
stay if you want.

35:51.360 --> 35:53.064
Reese.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.943
I'll get him for you.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.700
- Well?
- Nothing.

36:14.920 --> 36:19.628
I've had guys out all night
looking for him. Not a sign of him.

36:22.520 --> 36:25.544
Everything humanly possible, Mal.

37:10.160 --> 37:12.911
- See you at noon.
- You...

37:15.080 --> 37:16.341
Don't get lost.

37:25.600 --> 37:29.102
Yes? Yes, Mr. Carter.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.381
You can go in now, Mr. Reese.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.626
You can go in now, Mr. Reese.

37:44.440 --> 37:48.431
The usual formalities,
Mr. Reese. Nice and high.

37:49.120 --> 37:51.109
There you go.

37:55.320 --> 37:58.742
Three copies to them and
two up to Santa Barbara.

37:59.680 --> 38:03.910
- Three to Santa Barbara?
- I said, two.

38:08.720 --> 38:10.948
What are you fooling
around with now, Reese?

38:12.360 --> 38:15.384
There's a lot at stake, Mr. Carter.
That's why I came to you.

38:15.520 --> 38:18.430
- That's why I must...
- Must? There's no must about it.

38:18.560 --> 38:20.901
I'd be grateful for
anything you could do.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.821
You're trouble, Reese.
I've always thought so.

38:26.080 --> 38:29.662
I was against taking you back
in, but I was overruled.

38:30.360 --> 38:33.748
Wherever you go,
trouble finds you out.

38:33.840 --> 38:38.389
I certainly would appreciate anything
you could do for me, Mr. Carter.

38:39.280 --> 38:40.711
What's his name?

38:40.880 --> 38:42.744
Walker.

38:42.880 --> 38:44.311
What's his first name?

38:44.400 --> 38:46.502
He never called himself
anything but that.

38:46.600 --> 38:50.421
I've known him for years.
Not even his wife.

38:50.520 --> 38:53.749
Wife have something to
do with his grudge?

38:54.320 --> 38:56.024
Yeah.

38:57.120 --> 38:58.904
Figures.

39:02.200 --> 39:06.589
You know that mess you got us
into last year cost us $150,000.

39:07.080 --> 39:10.468
That's what Walker's here for, isn't it?
The money you paid us back.

39:10.560 --> 39:12.628
Only 93,000 belonged to him.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.221
Only 93,000.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.424
What's the story?

39:17.520 --> 39:19.861
A job, Mr. Carter.

39:20.000 --> 39:22.785
You remember the Alcatraz run?

39:22.920 --> 39:24.943
The one I brought into
the organization.

39:25.040 --> 39:27.791
Then Walker was one of
the men you held up?

39:28.240 --> 39:30.422
No. He was with me.

39:31.800 --> 39:33.948
You took his share,
too, is that it?

39:34.040 --> 39:36.871
I needed all of it to pay you back.

39:37.160 --> 39:40.582
You left with Walker's
share, and his wife.

39:40.800 --> 39:43.028
- She still with you?
- He killed her.

39:44.080 --> 39:45.909
You shouldn't have left him alive.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.822
Does he know where you are?

39:49.320 --> 39:51.991
- No, but he's looking.
- Fine.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.627
Fine. I'll tell you what we'll do.

39:57.920 --> 40:00.671
We'll let him know where you are.

40:01.240 --> 40:04.071
Then he'll come for you, won't he?

40:09.920 --> 40:11.829
They're waiting.

40:11.920 --> 40:13.431
It's a setup.

40:13.520 --> 40:16.829
They're spreading the word now.
They want you to try and get him.

40:16.920 --> 40:18.351
Where is he?

40:18.440 --> 40:22.022
The Huntley. A place run
by the organization.

40:24.560 --> 40:28.790
- Where would he be?
- All the way up. The penthouse.

40:29.760 --> 40:31.908
He always uses it.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.149
What's it like?

40:34.400 --> 40:36.309
Fort Knox.

40:37.560 --> 40:39.503
You've been there?

40:40.680 --> 40:43.306
Once. To see Lynne.

40:56.280 --> 40:58.348
What's that? An apartment house?

40:58.440 --> 41:00.065
Yeah.

41:01.080 --> 41:02.989
Residential.

41:11.160 --> 41:12.989
That goes up to the top?

41:13.080 --> 41:15.786
There's another elevator
inside the lobby...

41:15.840 --> 41:19.342
- ...goes up to the other penthouse.
- They got two?

41:21.320 --> 41:24.708
- What's the roof like?
- Flat. Open.

41:27.720 --> 41:30.744
Look at it. Men everywhere.

41:30.880 --> 41:33.142
You're gonna have a lot
of trouble getting in.

41:34.440 --> 41:36.907
But you'll never get out.

42:01.960 --> 42:05.621
- Well, he has to come out sometime.
- Yeah.

42:06.680 --> 42:09.511
How bad does he want you, Chris?

42:10.720 --> 42:15.508
- Oh, I don't know. Who knows?
- Yeah, you know. How bad?

42:17.480 --> 42:19.628
Pretty bad, I guess.

42:24.040 --> 42:27.542
Bad enough to let you
through into the Huntley?

42:31.360 --> 42:33.269
Why should I?

42:33.600 --> 42:35.782
Well, that's up to you.

43:10.880 --> 43:14.143
- Mr. Reese, please.
- Right over there.

43:18.640 --> 43:20.902
This way to heaven.

44:09.400 --> 44:11.821
We have a saying in Brazil.

44:12.120 --> 44:14.268
He says to go on up.

44:14.960 --> 44:19.224
It says <i>Deus é brasileiro</i>,
which means, God is Brazilian.

44:19.360 --> 44:21.701
So you see, we have no
worry in the world.

44:21.920 --> 44:23.784
Of course you have to wear a gun.

44:23.840 --> 44:26.591
- Why?
- That's a way of life.

44:31.040 --> 44:32.904
Hello, Mal.

44:34.240 --> 44:36.263
Go on in, honey.

44:48.320 --> 44:49.467
Are these all right?

44:49.520 --> 44:52.351
Yeah, that'll do fine.
Now tie yourselves up.

45:00.360 --> 45:03.031
No, not individually, together.

45:11.520 --> 45:13.827
Well, Cinderella.

45:14.280 --> 45:17.111
I was beginning to think you'd
never come for your shoe.

45:17.200 --> 45:19.507
Well, here I am.

45:21.640 --> 45:24.141
What made you change your mind?

45:24.240 --> 45:26.581
It's a woman's privilege.

45:28.960 --> 45:31.791
All good things come
to those who wait.

45:35.280 --> 45:38.031
Then I win first prize.

45:38.400 --> 45:39.831
Scotch?

45:40.960 --> 45:42.983
Scotch is fine.

45:44.520 --> 45:47.624
Do you know how long I've
been hung up on you?

45:51.240 --> 45:54.469
The first time I saw
you, with Lynne.

46:03.520 --> 46:07.181
I've got some business to settle here
first, then we'll go to New York.

46:07.520 --> 46:10.305
- You take empty bags.
- Sure, Mal.

46:10.400 --> 46:12.980
Operator? Give me the police.
This is an emergency.

46:13.120 --> 46:15.109
Now, wait till they answer.

46:15.800 --> 46:19.586
Yes. Help me, please.
Yeah, I'm being attacked.

46:19.680 --> 46:24.104
Ferguson, yes. 2291 Western.

46:24.200 --> 46:26.143
Across from the Huntley.
Second floor.

46:26.240 --> 46:28.069
Please, for God's sakes, hurry up.

46:29.000 --> 46:32.104
- Is that all right?
- That was fine, thank you.

46:40.120 --> 46:42.507
Have you seen Lynne lately?

46:43.160 --> 46:45.467
You know about her and me.

46:46.840 --> 46:49.671
You girls ought to
kiss and make up.

46:50.040 --> 46:51.904
I haven't seen her.

46:52.000 --> 46:54.751
Not since the two of you...

46:58.280 --> 47:00.428
You ever meet Walker?

47:00.720 --> 47:04.347
Oh, a couple of times.

47:04.640 --> 47:07.107
Didn't he die or something?

47:08.520 --> 47:10.861
About a year ago.

47:55.320 --> 48:00.301
- What's going on?
- It's okay, Mal. It's across the way.

48:01.080 --> 48:03.342
It's across the way.

48:20.120 --> 48:22.791
- Hey, what goes?
- It's across the street.

48:24.400 --> 48:27.151
It's all right. It's all right.

48:49.640 --> 48:51.424
Well, what do we do?

48:51.520 --> 48:53.304
Tell him.

48:56.560 --> 48:59.391
Two guys. They were attacked.

49:02.720 --> 49:05.266
- Hey, Mike?
- Yeah.

49:05.360 --> 49:08.942
- A couple of clowns got held up.
- Is that all?

49:09.000 --> 49:10.306
Huh.

49:21.040 --> 49:25.190
Mal, could we close the curtains?

49:25.280 --> 49:26.950
Sure.

49:31.360 --> 49:34.031
It's a great view but...

50:53.480 --> 50:55.230
Get up.

51:16.080 --> 51:18.581
You okay, Mal?

51:18.720 --> 51:20.390
Yeah.

51:22.360 --> 51:24.781
- What are you gonna do?
- I want you to come with me.

51:24.840 --> 51:28.262
- What for?
- I want my 93 grand.

51:33.000 --> 51:35.990
- You don't stand a chance.
- Mal.

51:37.080 --> 51:39.308
Mal. Mal. Wake up, Mal.

51:39.400 --> 51:42.344
Come on. Wake up. Don't go
to sleep. Let's go. Come on.

51:42.400 --> 51:43.831
On your feet. Let's go.

51:44.880 --> 51:47.824
- Let me get dressed.
- I want you this way, Mal.

51:47.920 --> 51:50.671
- My money, Mal.
- I've given it all to the organization.

51:50.760 --> 51:52.385
- Who has it?
- There's no one man.

51:52.440 --> 51:54.110
Go high enough, there's
always one man.

51:54.160 --> 51:57.184
No, it's not like that.
It's a big operation...

51:58.400 --> 52:03.028
- Names, Mal. Names.
- Fairfax.

52:03.640 --> 52:08.621
- Brewster. Kill me. Carter.
- No.

52:08.680 --> 52:10.908
- Come on, kill me.
- Who do you work for?

52:11.120 --> 52:15.066
- Carter. Come on, Walker, kill me.
- Where do I find him?

52:15.200 --> 52:18.110
It won't do you any good.
He's got protection.

52:18.200 --> 52:21.588
- Where do I find him?
- I don't remember.

52:21.680 --> 52:24.260
What do you mean,
you can't remember?

52:24.360 --> 52:26.781
- I can't remember. The Stuart Building.
- Where?

52:26.880 --> 52:28.345
He's got offices there.

52:28.440 --> 52:32.181
It's called The Multiplex
Company, on the 12th floor.

52:32.280 --> 52:36.146
- What's to keep me from getting in...?
- No one gets in without being searched.

52:36.200 --> 52:38.780
Don't worry about me.
Worry about yourself.

52:39.960 --> 52:44.031
I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll get it
for you, but you've got to trust me.

52:44.120 --> 52:46.871
Just trust me, Walker. Trust me.

52:46.960 --> 52:49.825
You... You... You...

52:49.880 --> 52:52.631
You're my friend, Walker.
You're my last chance.

52:52.720 --> 52:55.664
We're going to Carter. We're
gonna do this one together.

52:55.720 --> 52:57.948
Sure we will, Walker.
We'll live forever.

53:01.560 --> 53:03.424
Walker.

53:23.480 --> 53:25.039
- That's crazy.
- Reese.

53:25.040 --> 53:28.826
- Stand back, folks.
- Come on.

53:33.280 --> 53:35.030
What is it?

53:35.800 --> 53:38.062
Come on, let's get out of here.

53:54.520 --> 53:56.270
Stop it.

54:00.240 --> 54:04.106
Don't shoot. Don't
kill me. Save me.

54:05.480 --> 54:09.141
- Don't shoot. I quit.
- Who are you trying to kill?

54:09.240 --> 54:14.028
- Who are you shooting?
- Oh, my leg. My knee. Stop.

54:14.120 --> 54:16.951
Oh, my knee. Oh, stop.

54:17.040 --> 54:19.746
Take it easy...

54:21.080 --> 54:22.989
Oh, my knee.

54:24.200 --> 54:26.109
My knee.

55:39.240 --> 55:42.822
- I saw it, the ambulance and everything.
- Yeah, he fell.

55:42.880 --> 55:46.223
You let him fall? You should've
killed him. You owed it to yourself.

55:46.320 --> 55:49.151
This money belonged to your
sister. You better take it.

55:51.480 --> 55:53.981
You died at Alcatraz, all right.

55:54.120 --> 55:57.861
- Goodbye, Walker.
- Yeah, goodbye, Chris.

56:03.960 --> 56:05.391
I'd like the number...

56:05.440 --> 56:08.862
of the Multiplex Products Company,
please, that's in Los Angeles.

56:09.200 --> 56:12.668
If you're looking for Carter,
I might be able to help you.

56:21.840 --> 56:25.308
- Fred? Helen? Helen?
- Fred? Fred? Fred? Excellent.

56:25.400 --> 56:27.309
Oh, did I interrupt you?
I'm so sorry.

56:27.440 --> 56:29.861
Mr. Carter? I want
something from you too.

56:29.960 --> 56:33.143
- What's that?
- My 93,000.

56:33.280 --> 56:36.350
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah. It's my money.

56:36.440 --> 56:38.383
- Fred? Coffee tomorrow?
- Yes, you bet.

56:38.480 --> 56:40.309
So I don't have time
to turn around.

56:40.360 --> 56:43.350
Luncheons, dinners.
I'm getting fat as a pig.

56:43.440 --> 56:45.144
Reese owed us and paid us back.

56:45.200 --> 56:48.429
- Any debt he has to you is his problem.
- It's your problem now.

56:48.520 --> 56:50.190
Why don't you move over?

56:50.280 --> 56:53.224
- You don't own the place, you know.
- I'm sorry.

56:53.360 --> 56:55.064
Over here.

56:55.360 --> 56:57.986
Don't monopolize him.

56:58.400 --> 57:00.662
- Let me tell you about Reese.
- Reese is dead.

57:00.760 --> 57:04.785
They're scraping his body up off the
sidewalk in front of the Huntley.

57:05.080 --> 57:09.310
- Then his debt died with him, I'm afraid.
- Wrong. It passed on to you.

57:09.440 --> 57:12.020
No business corporation would
acknowledge that debt.

57:12.080 --> 57:14.467
If you don't, I'll kill you.

57:16.680 --> 57:18.942
One jump ahead of these
foreign designers.

57:19.080 --> 57:22.309
You must be stark staring mad.

57:22.400 --> 57:25.026
- You do know who you're dealing with?
- Listen to me.

57:25.120 --> 57:29.305
I want my money in 12 hours.
I'll tell you where to make the drop.

57:29.400 --> 57:32.583
If you don't, you are dead.

57:34.440 --> 57:37.225
I said nobody was to go up there.

57:37.320 --> 57:40.105
He could have done without
a girl for one night.

57:40.200 --> 57:43.144
- Mal told us to let her through.
- Oh, did he?

57:43.240 --> 57:47.390
Is that what I'm to tell our friends?
This is gonna cost me to cover up.

57:47.520 --> 57:50.021
The girl was Walker's
sister-in-law.

57:50.120 --> 57:52.302
- We didn't know that.
- You didn't know that.

57:52.400 --> 57:54.343
Well, he did. How the
hell did he know?

57:54.440 --> 57:57.430
- She was the Trojan horse.
- What did you say?

57:57.520 --> 58:00.464
I said, she was the Trojan horse.

58:00.560 --> 58:02.662
Trojan horse.

58:03.640 --> 58:05.947
You're a smart boy, Stegman.

58:07.320 --> 58:09.548
Come on, I wanna talk to you.

58:11.000 --> 58:13.751
- Get rid of them and bring the stuff.
- Right.

58:13.880 --> 58:15.391
The door is this way.

58:15.480 --> 58:17.582
- Do you know what I'm gonna do?
- Yeah.

58:17.720 --> 58:19.424
Gonna have him...

58:19.520 --> 58:21.224
- Wrong.
- Wrong?

58:21.320 --> 58:24.424
Killing Walker is no longer
an economic proposition.

58:24.560 --> 58:29.746
- What about the principle?
- Profit is the only principle. Come in.

58:31.200 --> 58:32.904
What are you gonna do?

58:33.000 --> 58:37.822
Nothing. You're gonna do it.
You're gonna pay Walker off.

58:37.920 --> 58:39.385
Is this money?

58:39.480 --> 58:41.867
Ever been so close to so much?

58:42.120 --> 58:44.746
I made an agreement
with Walker last night.

58:46.560 --> 58:48.788
The storm drain here.

58:48.920 --> 58:50.624
An open storm drain.

58:50.720 --> 58:54.302
Now, you go down and wait.
Walker will collect.

58:54.760 --> 58:57.340
- But why...
- Why what?

58:57.440 --> 58:58.905
Why me?

58:58.960 --> 59:01.427
Because you know him.
You know what he looks like.

59:01.520 --> 59:03.782
Oh, sure.

59:03.960 --> 59:06.301
When do you want me to go?

59:06.400 --> 59:08.867
Now, Stegman.

59:09.200 --> 59:12.588
- Now, use that door.
- Oh, sure.

59:12.800 --> 59:15.665
- Uh, Stegman?
- Yes?

59:16.160 --> 59:18.308
You will give Walker
his money, won't you?

59:19.360 --> 59:24.307
- Yes.
- You wouldn't try what Reese did?

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.949
Can I help you?

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.071
- Which door is he in?
- Behind me.

01:00:37.240 --> 01:00:39.388
Okay, the buzzer.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:01.583
- What are you doing? What do you want?
- I want my money.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.508
I don't understand. It's all
arranged as you wanted.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.910
You're crazy, Walker.
How can this help you?

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.625
Let's go.

01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.911
Because I want you to
pay me personally.

01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:27.029
You can't take me out of
here in broad daylight.

01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.466
Things aren't done this way.
Let's be reasonable.

01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.827
- It's a setup.
- I assure you, I always fix...

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.505
No.

01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.622
- And you authorized the payoff, huh?
- Yup.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.151
- You're the top man.
- Right.

01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:45.428
- What about Brewster?
- What do you know...?

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:47.787
- Reese talked.
- The two of us ran things.

01:02:47.840 --> 01:02:49.430
- Brewster and I.
- Nobody else?

01:02:49.480 --> 01:02:51.025
- That's right.
- Nobody?

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:52.745
- A money man.
- What's his name?

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.470
- Makes no difference.
- His name?

01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:56.349
Fairfax.

01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:59.624
I'm a businessman.
A man of my word.

01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:01.629
Stegman's with your
money, go get it.

01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:03.384
You go get it for me.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.386
No. No, it's all right.

01:03:08.680 --> 01:03:11.704
It's all right, it's Carter.

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.669
Carter?

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:34.145
- With that little thing?
- It's high-velocity. He was a good shot.

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:37.827
Carter, Brewster, Fairfax.

01:05:37.920 --> 01:05:41.308
- Brewster's next.
- Where do I find him?

01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:45.266
- He's out of town.
- When will he back?

01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:48.191
Tomorrow morning
he's got a meeting.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.269
I want him alone.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.502
We can fix that.

01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:55.350
Where's the meeting?

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:57.190
At his house.

01:05:57.280 --> 01:05:59.348
Where's his house?

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.627
We're here. This is it.

01:06:05.560 --> 01:06:06.991
I said, alone.

01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:13.911
Take it easy. You'll last longer.

01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:03.349
Hello, Walker.

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:07.667
So they really got to you, huh?

01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:10.790
I got well-paid for
fingering Reese.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.583
This place is like a morgue.
I should have moved months ago.

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:25.422
This guy you were going
around with, did he...?

01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.022
Spent some time here, huh?

01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.824
Yes.

01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.706
A lot of this stuff was his.

01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:38.101
So, what are you gonna do now?

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:42.261
I don't know. What are you...?
What about you?

01:07:47.720 --> 01:07:50.187
Are you asking me out?

01:08:25.399 --> 01:08:27.229
Walker.

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:45.064
Well, come on in.

01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:53.749
Whose is it?

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:57.943
Brewster's. It belongs to the
organization. They use it for meetings.

01:08:58.040 --> 01:09:00.620
Nobody lives in it,
that's for sure.

01:09:00.680 --> 01:09:04.023
Brewster, how do you
know he won't show up?

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:06.581
He will. That's why we're
here waiting for him.

01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:08.020
So, what am I doing here?

01:09:08.160 --> 01:09:10.944
I thought you'd be safer
with me than by yourself.

01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:14.024
And when do we expect our host?

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:18.265
- Any time. Maybe not until morning.
- You'll ask him for the money.

01:09:18.359 --> 01:09:21.145
- He'll say no and you'll kill him.
- Something like that.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:23.421
What did you think
this was, a pitch?

01:09:25.359 --> 01:09:26.825
Forget it.

01:09:26.920 --> 01:09:29.148
You forget it.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.828
<i>Good morning, Stevey.</i>

01:10:29.800 --> 01:10:32.904
<i>It wasn't Lois' idea
or Mrs. Jenkins'.</i>

01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.391
<i>It was yours.</i>

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.906
<i>What am I supposed to do?</i>

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.502
<i>Get real flattered and be grateful
to you for the rest of my life?</i>

01:10:40.560 --> 01:10:44.062
<i>You figure this will get me over
my neurotic inertia, or something?</i>

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:46.103
<i>Oh, get out of here.</i>

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.711
<i>You know what I...</i>

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:58.388
<i>The most fabulous
things happen to a girl...</i>

01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:01.385
<i>when she tries Pond's
seven-da y beauty plan.</i>

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:07.582
<i>All I did was cream twice each night
for a week with Pond's Cold Cream.</i>

01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:44.144
<i>You're a pathetic sight, Walker,
from where I'm standing.</i>

01:12:44.240 --> 01:12:46.820
<i>Chasing shadows.</i>

01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.630
<i>You're played out.</i>

01:12:48.760 --> 01:12:52.069
<i>It's over. You're finished.</i>

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:55.146
<i>What would you do with
the money if you got it?</i>

01:12:55.240 --> 01:12:57.661
<i>It wasn't yours in the first place.</i>

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:01.626
<i>Why don't you just
lie down and die.</i>

01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:30.108
- Going to work?
- Another day, another dollar.

01:16:35.080 --> 01:16:37.751
- Welcome back, boss.
- Bill.

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:42.108
- What do you want?
- My money.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:44.069
- What for?
- For Stegman.

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.667
Stegman's nothing.
Who killed Carter?

01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:51.668
Oh, Bill, Bill. The briefcase.

01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:57.470
- I did.
- Oh, you did.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:02.507
- What happened?
- Carter set it up.

01:17:02.600 --> 01:17:04.987
He was where Walker
should have been.

01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.831
- You don't care, do you?
- No, I love it.

01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:11.507
Leaves you in a spot. You killed the
man who was supposed to pay you.

01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:13.151
Who pays me?

01:17:13.240 --> 01:17:14.910
I can't hear you.

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:24.426
- What about Walker?
- What?

01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:26.941
Walker's still around.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.427
This organization will
take care of Walker.

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:31.622
Never happen. He's a pro.

01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:35.427
Walker's beautiful. He's
just tearing you apart.

01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:41.063
- You coming with me?
- Pass.

01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:46.342
I'll wait for Fairfax.
He'll pay me.

01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:48.704
All right.

01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.223
And, if he doesn't,
you can kill him too.

01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.630
Hey.

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:47.110
What's my last name?

01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.864
What's my first name?

01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:23.191
Look at that hillside.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:26.623
Nobody did any
watering or anything.

01:19:28.720 --> 01:19:32.302
You tell people to do things here
and it doesn't make any difference.

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:34.229
Now, just a minute.

01:19:38.720 --> 01:19:41.027
It's ice-cold, Bill.

01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:09.584
Walker.

01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:13.142
You're a very bad man,
very destructive.

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:16.389
Why do you run around doing
things like this? What do you want?

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:19.424
I want my money.
I want my 93 grand.

01:20:19.520 --> 01:20:21.622
Ninety-three thousand dollars?

01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:24.829
You threaten a financial
structure like this for $93,000?

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:27.671
Walker, I don't believe you.
What do you really want?

01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.350
I really want my money.

01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.144
I want my money.

01:20:31.480 --> 01:20:35.266
Well, I'm not gonna give you any money.
Nobody else is. Don't you understand?

01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:40.505
Carter!

01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:43.311
- Well, who runs things?
- Carter and I run things.

01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:46.111
- I run things.
- What about Fairfax?

01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:49.782
- Will he pay me?
- Fairfax is a man who signs checks.

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:52.309
- No, cash.
- Cash, checks.

01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:55.430
Fairfax isn't gonna give anything.
He's finished. He's dead.

01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:58.902
- He just doesn't know it yet.
- Somebody's gotta pay.

01:21:05.480 --> 01:21:08.743
- Make a phone call.
- Walker, it's a waste of time.

01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.030
All right.

01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:21.664
I'm just getting a cigar
out of here, that's all.

01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:33.985
Cash.

01:21:34.240 --> 01:21:36.468
You think I can go to
a hole in the wall...

01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:41.545
take out $93,000 and
peel it off for you?

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:46.066
- Operator.
- Brewster, Los Angeles.

01:21:46.160 --> 01:21:47.625
Get me Mr. Fairfax, will you?

01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:49.908
Let me tell you about
corporations, Walker.

01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.421
This is a corporation.
I'm an officer in it.

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.509
We deal in millions.
We never see cash.

01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:57.061
I got about $11 in my pocket.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.661
<i>- How are you?</i>
- Yeah, I just got in.

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.271
<i>How's the weather up there?</i>

01:22:01.360 --> 01:22:03.906
Oh, it's all right. Dried
up the lawn a little bit.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:10.545
Listen, I've got a man named Walker
with me, he says we owe him $93,000.

01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:18.302
- Are you gonna say anything?
<i>- Well, what do you want me to say?</i>

01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:26.065
He says he's going to shoot
me unless I give him $93,000.

01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:29.264
<i>Look, Brewster, you know
me better than that.</i>

01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:34.149
Wanna say a word?

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:37.471
How much is Brewster
worth to you, Fairfax?

01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:41.142
<i>Threatening phone
calls don't impress me.</i>

01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:45.147
Fairfax, he's getting
ready to fire the gun.

01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:49.548
- Yes or no?
<i>- Of course not.</i>

01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:06.144
Walker? What's happened?

01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:08.741
Nothing, he... Where'd
you come from?

01:23:08.840 --> 01:23:11.830
- I'm with him.
- Oh, you're...

01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:14.711
Uh...

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.710
Walker, it occurred to me that...

01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:29.428
That we might still be able
to do something for you.

01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:32.268
I mean, get you the money you want.

01:23:33.720 --> 01:23:35.982
But not here in Los Angeles.

01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:39.989
There's still one setup where
large sums of money change hands.

01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:42.421
It's up in San Francisco.

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:46.786
The Alcatraz run. Oh, you
remember it with Reese.

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:49.786
It's still there. Once
a week. Every week.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.864
Alcatraz.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.791
The drop has changed, but
the run is still the same.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:00.309
So, well, if you wanna go
up to San Francisco, we...

01:24:01.880 --> 01:24:04.108
Well, her too, if she wants.

01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.348
I mean, anything you want.

01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:10.146
You can trust me, Walker.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:30.464
There's supposed to be a light
on that landing where you are.

01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:34.102
I don't know exactly where
it is, but it's up there.

01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:41.064
Is that it?

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.104
All right, good.

01:24:52.200 --> 01:24:54.621
Just stay in the light.

01:24:55.280 --> 01:24:58.748
- What do you mean?
- Well, nothing's gonna happen, is it?

01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:02.228
No, nothing's gonna happen. Except
what I said was gonna happen.

01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:05.947
We're gonna make the exchange and
you're gonna get your money.

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:12.424
The whole thing's just
a routine, Walker.

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:22.822
What are you looking for?

01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:25.302
There's nobody else here.

01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.502
Walker?

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.586
Walker?

01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.946
Walker?

01:26:00.280 --> 01:26:02.223
There it is.

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.909
Hey, Walker?

01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.830
Walker?

01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:15.224
Coming in.

01:26:15.680 --> 01:26:18.863
Safe as a church. Your money.

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:22.582
What about your friend Fairfax?

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.784
Fairfax is dead.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:28.381
- Or he will be tomorrow.
- It is tomorrow.

01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:30.901
- Help me carry the box up?
- No.

01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:28.705
Well, here's your money, Walker.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.266
Walk...

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:38.271
Walker. Walker.

01:27:38.360 --> 01:27:42.146
Why did you do that? Walker?

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:48.030
Walker didn't shoot you.

01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:54.749
Fairfax?

01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:02.830
This is Fairfax, Walker! Kill him!

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:07.020
You should've stayed an accountant.

01:28:12.320 --> 01:28:14.900
Our deal's done, Walker.

01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:18.146
Brewster was the last one.

01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.825
He thought he could
take over from me.

01:28:30.520 --> 01:28:32.543
Hey, Walker?

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:38.268
Come on in with me.

01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:42.589
I've been looking years
for someone like you.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:51.271
Well, come and get
your money, then!

01:28:54.120 --> 01:28:56.791
Come on and get it!

01:29:00.840 --> 01:29:03.386
I pay my debts!

01:29:06.960 --> 01:29:08.789
Walker?

01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:12.783
Walker?

01:29:36.760 --> 01:29:38.271
Well?

01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:44.584
Walker?!

01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:52.351
This is the last time!

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:04.782
How do you like that?

01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:08.143
I like it.

01:30:14.760 --> 01:30:16.430
Leave it.
