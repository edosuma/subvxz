WEBVTT

00:00.820 --> 00:01.819
tonight on the curse of Oak Island

00:01.819 --> 00:06.390
that's a king George this is a treasure

00:06.390 --> 00:09.019
on the street 1700s that changes a lot

00:09.019 --> 00:11.839
they're not supposed to be here the

00:11.839 --> 00:13.089
people who did this wanted it to be

00:13.089 --> 00:14.089
found

00:14.089 --> 00:23.220
take it slow the world hasn't seen this

00:23.220 --> 00:24.220
hey what's that goal shiny thing needs

00:24.220 --> 00:25.220
holy smokes

00:25.220 --> 00:26.220
that's amazing

00:26.220 --> 00:27.220
my hope as I'm watching this just show

00:27.220 --> 00:31.350
me one man-made object what's that

00:31.350 --> 00:34.800
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:34.800 --> 00:36.440
where people have been looking for an

00:36.440 --> 00:39.880
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:39.880 --> 00:43.239
years so far they have found bits of

00:43.239 --> 00:46.840
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:46.840 --> 00:50.510
symbols carved into it even a 17th

00:50.510 --> 00:54.090
century Spanish coin to date six men

00:54.090 --> 00:58.800
have died trying to solve the mystery

00:58.800 --> 01:02.044
and according to legend one more will

01:02.044 --> 01:10.900
have to die before the treasure can be

01:10.900 --> 01:14.340
found

01:14.340 --> 01:26.100
well let's a little can see one and then

01:26.100 --> 01:28.600
take a few grabs out of it for Rick and

01:28.600 --> 01:31.960
Marty lagina and their partners this

01:31.960 --> 01:34.100
search for treasure on Oak Island has

01:34.100 --> 01:37.270
led them to a massive 40 inch wide steel

01:37.270 --> 01:43.450
case for haul to simply known sc1 today

01:43.450 --> 01:45.399
sir good day the Scots

01:45.399 --> 01:49.550
lashed out there yeah we are absolutely

01:49.550 --> 01:53.310
ready to go man it was at this very spot

01:53.310 --> 01:56.340
where last year Island historian Charles

01:56.340 --> 01:59.690
Barkhouse advised the team to drill an

01:59.690 --> 02:02.369
exploratory borehole in an effort to

02:02.369 --> 02:04.810
locate the site of the original money

02:04.810 --> 02:10.310
pit after reaching a depth of 171 feet

02:10.310 --> 02:13.520
they encountered would appear to be a 21

02:13.520 --> 02:15.620
foot deep void in the bedrock below

02:15.620 --> 02:23.090
here we go but even more astonishing was

02:23.090 --> 02:25.360
what they saw after placing a pipe

02:25.360 --> 02:29.510
inspection camera into the hole what's

02:29.510 --> 02:35.140
that looks metallic yellow that is your

02:35.140 --> 02:39.160
gold color

02:39.160 --> 02:41.860
now after drilling a hole that is wide

02:41.860 --> 02:44.660
enough and secure enough for a diver to

02:44.660 --> 02:47.450
explore they are inserting a

02:47.450 --> 02:50.440
high-resolution camera into the shaft in

02:50.440 --> 02:52.730
an effort to see if they can locate the

02:52.730 --> 02:55.010
mysterious gold colored object they

02:55.010 --> 02:56.391
spotted last year

02:56.391 --> 02:59.590
I'm gonna make a prediction that the

02:59.590 --> 03:02.920
waters like off don't take smoosh into

03:02.920 --> 03:08.040
water I don't know how many hours I've

03:08.040 --> 03:12.510
spent watching swirly things in water

03:12.510 --> 03:15.400
Brad forty feet right now he's going

03:15.400 --> 03:20.010
quick sure is this shiny gold thing

03:20.010 --> 03:22.330
gonna be there I hope for David that the

03:22.330 --> 03:26.580
shiny gold thing is there oh look at

03:26.580 --> 03:30.150
that it's remarkably clear I stand

03:30.150 --> 03:32.890
corrected on this one I thought it'd be

03:32.890 --> 03:34.400
- nothing I never thought it'd be just

03:34.400 --> 03:36.290
clear he gave it a 90 percent chance of

03:36.290 --> 03:38.600
not seeing anything - me too I believe I

03:38.600 --> 03:42.310
was at a hundred so as your casing at

03:42.310 --> 03:43.310
one oh yeah

03:43.310 --> 03:49.840
you write down or it's a black thing

03:49.840 --> 04:03.310
right there straight over here you'd

04:03.310 --> 04:05.350
rotate it around Scott go up 90 degrees

04:05.350 --> 04:07.180
and then perpendicular or horizontal and

04:07.180 --> 04:11.930
rotate okay well this we're close to the

04:11.930 --> 04:13.910
wall or it almost looks like yeah it's a

04:13.910 --> 04:14.910
cavity yeah

04:14.910 --> 04:17.630
and the plane goes back further opens up

04:17.630 --> 04:20.920
that one yeah we saw an interesting

04:20.920 --> 04:23.220
anomalous feature in the wall of the

04:23.220 --> 04:26.000
cavity down see one is that a tunnel is

04:26.000 --> 04:28.010
it an access point it's somewhat of a

04:28.010 --> 04:35.300
guess can you pan around do stuff yep

04:35.300 --> 04:40.010
way that looks chipped out right there

04:40.010 --> 04:49.880
zoom in on this

04:49.880 --> 04:52.620
that has a 90 degree angle to it there's

04:52.620 --> 04:56.550
no way that's more than you

04:56.550 --> 04:58.210
because 90-degree angles are something

04:58.210 --> 05:01.500
rarely found in nature it's possible

05:01.500 --> 05:03.600
that what Rick Marty and the team are

05:03.600 --> 05:06.650
looking at is really a man-made feature

05:06.650 --> 05:11.380
but if some who carved it and for what

05:11.380 --> 05:13.130
purpose

05:13.130 --> 05:14.970
every time we're looking underground on

05:14.970 --> 05:16.290
Oak Island it's intriguing and

05:16.290 --> 05:18.640
interesting the problem is you know you

05:18.640 --> 05:21.760
come away with what did I really see

05:21.760 --> 05:25.790
what does that really mean

05:25.790 --> 05:30.870
where's our shiny gold thing Oh what is

05:30.870 --> 05:35.640
that shiny thing as the team actually

05:35.640 --> 05:38.300
located the same mysterious gold colored

05:38.300 --> 05:41.370
object Rick and Charles spotted last

05:41.370 --> 05:44.710
year or perhaps another one

05:44.710 --> 05:47.830
are you rotating up Scotty yeah I just

05:47.830 --> 05:51.220
want to see like see anything yeah what

05:51.220 --> 05:52.450
do you think it looks like well it's

05:52.450 --> 05:53.930
shining off the wall there's something

05:53.930 --> 05:55.330
sticking out from the wall looks like

05:55.330 --> 05:57.440
Greg don't you think yeah I think it's

05:57.440 --> 06:00.480
just chips in there anhydrate when the

06:00.480 --> 06:04.120
quartz is reflecting back the light yeah

06:04.120 --> 06:06.410
you know I hate to say it I hope that

06:06.410 --> 06:10.370
wasn't Dave's gold shiny thing that

06:10.370 --> 06:11.800
shape color had a curved shape dude

06:11.800 --> 06:17.250
the team's inability to find further

06:17.250 --> 06:19.200
evidence of the shiny gold colored

06:19.200 --> 06:22.060
object they photographed last year is

06:22.060 --> 06:24.680
puzzling could it be that by making the

06:24.680 --> 06:28.120
hole wider the object has been dislodged

06:28.120 --> 06:30.210
and now lies somewhere at the bottom of

06:30.210 --> 06:33.180
the cavity I'm gonna go find the bottom

06:33.180 --> 06:34.180
go on down

06:34.180 --> 06:43.090
how deep are we the four feet from the

06:43.090 --> 06:50.050
bottom 176 all right yeah okay

06:50.050 --> 06:54.169
177 I think is where we go into the

06:54.169 --> 06:56.730
black silk what about I don't know a

06:56.730 --> 06:59.010
foot off bottom looks like now let's

06:59.010 --> 07:01.200
come up so I know much clearer cavity we

07:01.200 --> 07:04.020
have the sudden presence of a layer of

07:04.020 --> 07:07.490
heavy silt and black sludge as for now

07:07.490 --> 07:12.550
prevented further examination 575 okay

07:12.550 --> 07:15.580
so we got seven feet of clear hole

07:15.580 --> 07:17.610
there's a bunch of cavity below there we

07:17.610 --> 07:20.830
can't see anything the Oak Island team

07:20.830 --> 07:23.490
will have to resort to other options if

07:23.490 --> 07:25.360
they are ever to find anything like a

07:25.360 --> 07:28.150
precious Marta fact or possibly evidence

07:28.150 --> 07:33.450
of treasure lying within the void

07:33.450 --> 07:34.700
so with us do you think he was still in

07:34.700 --> 07:38.310
a hammer grab yes yes I can't think of

07:38.310 --> 07:39.840
anything we'd see here that would make

07:39.840 --> 07:42.120
me not want a hammer grab in here what

07:42.120 --> 07:45.090
about a diver I think we need to get the

07:45.090 --> 07:47.580
true dimensions before we send a guy

07:47.580 --> 07:50.080
down there yeah maybe we should try

07:50.080 --> 07:51.080
summer I agree

07:51.080 --> 07:55.800
this island keeps tantalizing it keeps

07:55.800 --> 07:57.490
giving you a little bit and then dashing

07:57.490 --> 08:00.080
you on the rocks so to speak I think we

08:00.080 --> 08:04.330
can come home come on oh it's got yeah

08:04.330 --> 08:05.650
we were hoping we'd see something

08:05.650 --> 08:08.010
metallic gold would be great we had

08:08.010 --> 08:10.450
indications of it and we did not see it

08:10.450 --> 08:13.310
with the camera but of course as always

08:13.310 --> 08:15.810
we're not done we're gonna hammer grab

08:15.810 --> 08:17.530
till we can't hammer grab anymore we're

08:17.530 --> 08:19.061
gonna run sonar and then depending on

08:19.061 --> 08:20.710
the results of the sonar we may put a

08:20.710 --> 08:23.410
diver down there we got the conduit if

08:23.410 --> 08:24.781
there's anything worth doing we're gonna

08:24.781 --> 08:26.570
have a look at it now let's go do our

08:26.570 --> 08:28.180
other jobs okay yep

08:28.180 --> 08:36.210
while Rick Marty and the team arrange to

08:36.210 --> 08:38.590
set up a hammer grab tool to further

08:38.590 --> 08:41.839
explore the c1 shaft

08:41.839 --> 08:44.219
what is this area in natchez this would

08:44.219 --> 08:47.740
be lot 24 Oak Island historian Charles

08:47.740 --> 08:50.390
Barkhouse and metal detection expert

08:50.390 --> 08:53.510
Gary Drayton searched for clues on lot

08:53.510 --> 08:58.300
24 near the western end of the island

08:58.300 --> 09:01.210
this was one of the nine four acre lots

09:01.210 --> 09:02.990
that were once owned by the former

09:02.990 --> 09:08.620
American slave Samuel ball it's a little

09:08.620 --> 09:15.450
chippy on signal okay born into slavery

09:15.450 --> 09:20.420
in South Carolina in 1765

09:20.420 --> 09:22.640
Samuel ball won his freedom by agreeing

09:22.640 --> 09:24.620
to fight for the British during the

09:24.620 --> 09:28.880
American Revolution but although he was

09:28.880 --> 09:31.300
reported to have lived on Oak Island as

09:31.300 --> 09:34.460
a simple cabbage farmer by the time of

09:34.460 --> 09:38.920
his death in 1846 he had become one of

09:38.920 --> 09:42.300
the wealthiest men in the area he's

09:42.300 --> 09:43.510
always been the mystery out of Oak

09:43.510 --> 09:45.360
Island and there are a lot of mystery

09:45.360 --> 09:47.370
men but he's always been at the top of

09:47.370 --> 09:49.630
the list and what's very intriguing

09:49.630 --> 09:51.890
yesterday for the monies that were paid

09:51.890 --> 09:53.880
for the lots that he ended up owning on

09:53.880 --> 09:56.450
Oak Island he could have bought hundreds

09:56.450 --> 09:58.790
of acres on the mainland why did he

09:58.790 --> 10:02.380
choose to remain here Judge des roses

10:02.380 --> 10:04.290
history of the county of Lunenburg right

10:04.290 --> 10:06.730
which does have a section regarding

10:06.730 --> 10:09.250
Samuel ball on a recent trip to the

10:09.250 --> 10:12.870
Genealogical Society in nearby Lunenburg

10:12.870 --> 10:15.070
Charles Barkhouse along with journalist

10:15.070 --> 10:17.190
and author Randall Sullivan you

10:17.190 --> 10:19.500
discovered important evidence that it

10:19.500 --> 10:22.070
might have been Samuel ball and not

10:22.070 --> 10:24.510
Anthony Vaughn who is one of the three

10:24.510 --> 10:26.770
original discoverers of the Oak Island

10:26.770 --> 10:29.040
money pit in the first edition of this

10:29.040 --> 10:31.500
book Samuel ball he's named as one of

10:31.500 --> 10:33.100
the original finders of the money pit

10:33.100 --> 10:36.300
and in the subsequent editions his name

10:36.300 --> 10:39.110
is removed and no explanation

10:39.110 --> 10:42.180
this is money pit where your ancestors

10:42.180 --> 10:43.650
were standing probably right in this

10:43.650 --> 10:45.900
area right here Wow

10:45.900 --> 10:49.010
last year during a rare visit three of

10:49.010 --> 10:51.450
Daniel mcginnises direct descendants

10:51.450 --> 10:53.640
returned to Oak Island to share an

10:53.640 --> 10:56.870
incredible story one that had never been

10:56.870 --> 11:00.820
publicly told before grandpa Daniel

11:00.820 --> 11:03.580
noticed the depression in the ground so

11:03.580 --> 11:05.899
he and his two friends started digging

11:05.899 --> 11:10.810
now I've been told they found three

11:10.810 --> 11:14.930
treasure chests really really and what

11:14.930 --> 11:16.550
is in this box

11:16.550 --> 11:19.170
is one of the things that came from that

11:19.170 --> 11:23.720
chest the one that McGinnis took Wow

11:23.720 --> 11:25.860
could Samuel ball have used the money

11:25.860 --> 11:27.940
from one of the three reported treasure

11:27.940 --> 11:31.149
chests to purchase additional acreage on

11:31.149 --> 11:32.149
Oak Island

11:32.149 --> 11:35.779
I believe the legend or the folklore is

11:35.779 --> 11:37.040
that Samuel ball got kind of

11:37.040 --> 11:39.649
unexpectedly wealthy and it came here

11:39.649 --> 11:42.080
with nothing we're pretty sure of that

11:42.080 --> 11:43.790
there are a lot of questions that mode

11:43.790 --> 11:44.790
sent me wall

11:44.790 --> 11:52.150
thankfully it's a coin it's not it's not

11:52.150 --> 11:54.190
very deep reading it's only six inches

11:54.190 --> 12:01.130
there yeah good weight of it now

12:01.130 --> 12:09.220
it's not a good sign when it says

12:09.220 --> 12:10.730
shallow lazarey

12:10.730 --> 12:17.010
it's not a coin no it's a book that's a

12:17.010 --> 12:18.740
fancy bomb

12:18.740 --> 12:21.190
yeah that's seventeen hundred's really

12:21.190 --> 12:23.740
yeah they call of dandy buttons did

12:23.740 --> 12:25.830
anybody yeah as opposed to more of a

12:25.830 --> 12:28.861
common yeah yeah there is something like

12:28.861 --> 12:31.370
a shield on there they call these the

12:31.370 --> 12:33.850
small ones are normally referred to as

12:33.850 --> 12:35.940
cuff buttons and the larger ones are

12:35.940 --> 12:39.110
normally jacket coat buttons but cool

12:39.110 --> 12:49.100
fine yeah very cool fine hey keep going

12:49.100 --> 12:54.240
okay Gary started getting these hits I

12:54.240 --> 12:56.040
mean he was pretty excited and when Gary

12:56.040 --> 12:58.130
gets excited that's when everybody else

12:58.130 --> 13:00.779
should get excited let me check it yeah

13:00.779 --> 13:02.700
the fact that there are a number of

13:02.700 --> 13:05.020
metal objects being discovered on lock

13:05.020 --> 13:08.500
24 is an indication that the area was

13:08.500 --> 13:12.720
once the site of much human activity but

13:12.720 --> 13:15.399
could this location also yield other

13:15.399 --> 13:18.700
important information perhaps revealing

13:18.700 --> 13:22.779
just how samuel ball amassed his fortune

13:22.779 --> 13:26.520
look at this girl look I can see the

13:26.520 --> 13:30.240
round edge at the side of B roof Zeca

13:30.240 --> 13:33.500
coin yeah it's the coin

13:33.500 --> 13:35.840
yeah I recognize that guy you know is

13:35.840 --> 13:39.360
that's King George the second defamation

13:39.360 --> 13:42.100
so that would put this coin to the 1700

13:42.100 --> 13:45.990
yeah this is a treasure on this dream

13:45.990 --> 13:47.930
King George the second reigned over

13:47.930 --> 13:53.480
Great Britain from 1727 to 1760 a period

13:53.480 --> 13:55.610
that predates the discovery of the money

13:55.610 --> 13:59.500
pit by nearly four decades could this

13:59.500 --> 14:01.660
coin have once been part of the Oak

14:01.660 --> 14:05.310
Island treasure or could it have been

14:05.310 --> 14:08.310
left here more than two centuries ago by

14:08.310 --> 14:10.160
someone who came to the island looking

14:10.160 --> 14:11.780
for it

14:11.780 --> 14:13.470
let's keep going

14:13.470 --> 14:25.180
it's another coin signal Charles yeah I

14:25.180 --> 14:27.709
mean about here yep

14:27.709 --> 14:37.300
just a lot very deep

14:37.300 --> 14:39.220
what

14:39.220 --> 14:43.790
you know what that is said this is a

14:43.790 --> 14:46.290
type of thing that would be carried by a

14:46.290 --> 14:49.100
British soldier and he would chop off an

14:49.100 --> 14:53.160
inch of it and put it in the lead mold

14:53.160 --> 14:55.360
for making the musket balls this is a

14:55.360 --> 14:57.920
ninja a letting go for making musket

14:57.920 --> 15:00.779
balls Wow

15:00.779 --> 15:02.110
now we've got start putting things

15:02.110 --> 15:04.160
together we've got a button we've got

15:04.160 --> 15:06.860
coins and this may be this is some kind

15:06.860 --> 15:07.860
of clamp

15:07.860 --> 15:09.110
you know the encampment part that you're

15:09.110 --> 15:11.480
talking about kind of fits into Fred

15:11.480 --> 15:13.839
Nolan's theory he believed that this is

15:13.839 --> 15:16.279
a British military operation in 1762

15:16.279 --> 15:20.930
after the sacking of the vana in 1762

15:20.930 --> 15:24.520
during the period known as the Seven

15:24.520 --> 15:27.820
Years War the British Royal Navy invaded

15:27.820 --> 15:30.690
Havana Cuba in an effort to defeat the

15:30.690 --> 15:34.649
Spanish Armada after capturing the city

15:34.649 --> 15:37.040
the British confiscated a vast hoard of

15:37.040 --> 15:39.339
treasure much of which had been looted

15:39.339 --> 15:43.940
by conquistadors centuries before the

15:43.940 --> 15:46.800
British then loaded their spoils and

15:46.800 --> 15:49.459
sailed to the board of Halifax some 60

15:49.459 --> 15:50.910
miles north of Oak Island

15:50.910 --> 15:55.100
but there are many theorists who believe

15:55.100 --> 15:56.480
that part of the treasure was

15:56.480 --> 15:58.290
deliberately diverted south to Oak

15:58.290 --> 16:01.399
Island or renegade naval officers

16:01.399 --> 16:04.290
instructed a team of military engineers

16:04.290 --> 16:07.480
to hide the treasure ship

16:07.480 --> 16:09.970
could gary drayton be finding evidence

16:09.970 --> 16:16.310
that this incredible theory is true that

16:16.310 --> 16:19.180
sounds better not very deep Iver

16:19.180 --> 16:27.750
okay it's reading like four or five

16:27.750 --> 16:31.100
inches

16:31.100 --> 16:37.071
you see that on the top what is that

16:37.071 --> 16:38.071
like that yeah

16:38.071 --> 16:41.490
I know what it looks like to me okay I'm

16:41.490 --> 16:45.420
writing on it it sounds like some kind

16:45.420 --> 16:49.040
of script right you see here across it I

16:49.040 --> 16:50.040
see that yeah

16:50.040 --> 16:52.420
what would you say that is new to me it

16:52.420 --> 16:55.190
would look like it was off for the stock

16:55.190 --> 17:00.840
of like a or a musket okay you know

17:00.840 --> 17:03.209
somebody's signature this is somebody's

17:03.209 --> 17:04.209
name

17:04.209 --> 17:11.279
Highschool that is very cool this is

17:11.279 --> 17:14.419
somebody's signature this is somebody's

17:14.419 --> 17:17.279
name while searching for artifacts on

17:17.279 --> 17:20.929
lot 24 the area once owned in the early

17:20.929 --> 17:25.108
1800s by Oak Island resident Samuel ball

17:25.108 --> 17:27.628
metal detection expert Gary Drayton

17:27.628 --> 17:30.159
along with Oak Island historian Charles

17:30.159 --> 17:33.049
Barkhouse have just made a number of

17:33.049 --> 17:35.419
incredible and potentially significant

17:35.419 --> 17:38.450
discoveries so we've got six coins of

17:38.450 --> 17:41.539
fancy Bolton and we look at that rivet

17:41.539 --> 17:43.480
yeah and the way that's curves that

17:43.480 --> 17:45.940
could have been on the end of a pistol

17:45.940 --> 17:48.070
based on your experience are you willing

17:48.070 --> 17:49.580
to say that this could be a camp yeah

17:49.580 --> 17:52.009
some kind of encampment that's amazing

17:52.009 --> 17:57.350
an encampment good Charles and Gary be

17:57.350 --> 17:59.470
looking at evidence that the stories

17:59.470 --> 18:03.529
about stolen Spanish gold are true if so

18:03.529 --> 18:06.059
could the treasure still be hidden

18:06.059 --> 18:08.799
somewhere on the island hey Marty yeah

18:08.799 --> 18:14.611
over here what do you guys got tell them

18:14.611 --> 18:17.029
what you think we found lay it on me

18:17.029 --> 18:20.379
what do you got some good news good news

18:20.379 --> 18:22.379
roundness rounder yep

18:22.379 --> 18:25.909
Holy Smoke look at these Wow

18:25.909 --> 18:33.210
oh hi there yes see king george ii was

18:33.210 --> 18:37.169
that date from early 1700 no kidneys are

18:37.169 --> 18:39.659
all British coppers all in one spot

18:39.659 --> 18:42.299
yeah we've got six of them in this small

18:42.299 --> 18:45.039
little radius here

18:45.039 --> 18:48.519
and this there's got script no I think

18:48.519 --> 18:51.790
this is offer the end of a pistol you

18:51.790 --> 18:56.100
see the writing on them that could be

18:56.100 --> 19:01.100
the person's name you own the pistol I

19:01.100 --> 19:03.870
just think this there's so much stuff

19:03.870 --> 19:06.149
here I think this is an encampment or a

19:06.149 --> 19:08.590
camp well then we really could be onto

19:08.590 --> 19:11.370
something right it's very exciting we

19:11.370 --> 19:13.789
could be on some kind of encampment and

19:13.789 --> 19:16.210
Gary feels it's George the seconds head

19:16.210 --> 19:18.499
on there so if it's George the second it

19:18.499 --> 19:20.090
predates the original finding of the

19:20.090 --> 19:22.320
money pit so even more exciting this

19:22.320 --> 19:26.389
quite a haul Wow Gary 1700s that changes

19:26.389 --> 19:30.899
a lot they're not supposed to be here no

19:30.899 --> 19:33.879
gary drayton spine names on lot 24 have

19:33.879 --> 19:35.789
validated much that has long been

19:35.789 --> 19:38.720
speculated about Samuel ball and his

19:38.720 --> 19:41.129
connections to both the discovery of the

19:41.129 --> 19:44.259
money pit and the search for treasure on

19:44.259 --> 19:46.239
Oak Island

19:46.239 --> 19:48.989
if anything it only serves to fuel

19:48.989 --> 19:51.049
interest in the possibility that

19:51.049 --> 19:53.620
something of enormous value was buried

19:53.620 --> 19:58.330
here centuries ago something that still

19:58.330 --> 20:01.320
may lie undiscovered and undisturbed

20:01.320 --> 20:06.429
several hundred feet deep underground

20:06.429 --> 20:10.149
this would have been just everyday mommy

20:10.149 --> 20:16.700
Wow Gary that's got a jingle to where's

20:16.700 --> 20:21.090
the gold never satisfied yeah I know

20:21.090 --> 20:22.600
well you're only as good as your last

20:22.600 --> 20:26.340
fine yeah well we'll give you credit

20:26.340 --> 20:29.700
okay let's take a break it gets tiring

20:29.700 --> 20:31.529
digging all these King George copies

20:31.529 --> 20:36.779
yeah

20:36.779 --> 20:39.629
after a day fall up new discoveries Oh

20:39.629 --> 20:42.210
Randall I wanna thank you for coming

20:42.210 --> 20:44.759
back Rick Marty and their partners meet

20:44.759 --> 20:47.509
in the war room with investigative

20:47.509 --> 20:49.789
journalist and author Randall Sullivan

20:49.789 --> 20:51.159
and though you've been out in a boat in

20:51.159 --> 20:53.269
the field researching Oak Island and

20:53.269 --> 20:55.529
were very much interested in what you've

20:55.529 --> 20:57.279
been up to well I've been learning

20:57.279 --> 20:59.429
things I didn't know after spending the

20:59.429 --> 21:02.320
previous four weeks in Nova Scotia he

21:02.320 --> 21:04.179
has all but completed the research

21:04.179 --> 21:06.860
needed for a book that promises to shed

21:06.860 --> 21:10.460
new light on the Oak Island mystery

21:10.460 --> 21:13.080
somebody did some fantastic work here it

21:13.080 --> 21:17.269
has to be for some fantastic reason and

21:17.269 --> 21:19.450
that has inclined me to think it's more

21:19.450 --> 21:21.309
likely than not that the people who did

21:21.309 --> 21:26.040
this wanted it to be found you're

21:26.040 --> 21:28.419
intimating that the depositor never

21:28.419 --> 21:30.269
intended to come back for it themselves

21:30.269 --> 21:31.759
it was meant to be fun at some point in

21:31.759 --> 21:34.309
the future yes that's the theory I find

21:34.309 --> 21:36.609
most compelling to motivate people to do

21:36.609 --> 21:39.179
it and then keep it secret I just think

21:39.179 --> 21:42.340
you'd have to have some higher purpose

21:42.340 --> 21:47.970
honestly had to start back it at the

21:47.970 --> 21:50.389
beginning but just based on the things I

21:50.389 --> 21:53.979
heard during a meeting in the war room

21:53.979 --> 21:57.419
Rick Marty Craig and members of the team

21:57.419 --> 21:58.860
are getting a debriefing from

21:58.860 --> 22:01.059
investigative journalists and Oak Island

22:01.059 --> 22:04.369
historian Randal Sullivan but you know

22:04.369 --> 22:06.429
we're just like you I mean I'm making

22:06.429 --> 22:10.889
the best guess I can based on what is

22:10.889 --> 22:14.369
there early maps after spending several

22:14.369 --> 22:17.570
years conducting research in addition to

22:17.570 --> 22:19.639
spending the past several weeks

22:19.639 --> 22:22.039
interviewing archivists and historians

22:22.039 --> 22:24.799
in and around Halifax Nova Scotia and

22:24.799 --> 22:26.629
this is a genealogy it is yeah

22:26.629 --> 22:29.159
he believes he has finally been able to

22:29.159 --> 22:32.299
verify the identity of the very person

22:32.299 --> 22:34.240
who could have been the architect of the

22:34.240 --> 22:38.029
entire Oak Island mystery

22:38.029 --> 22:40.610
the one theory that really has connected

22:40.610 --> 22:42.369
with me is the whole thing involving

22:42.369 --> 22:46.529
Francis Bacon there is so much evidence

22:46.529 --> 22:48.330
that is connected to Francis Bacon that

22:48.330 --> 22:50.850
supports the idea that I find myself

22:50.850 --> 22:53.570
pretty fascinated by the whole story is

22:53.570 --> 22:55.690
mysterious but he actually is the one

22:55.690 --> 23:00.200
that I think is the most mysterious Sir

23:00.200 --> 23:03.809
Francis Bacon the 17th century British

23:03.809 --> 23:07.899
philosopher scientist and nobleman of

23:07.899 --> 23:09.970
the many intriguing theories about Oak

23:09.970 --> 23:13.159
Island those involving Francis Bacon

23:13.159 --> 23:15.950
proved the most persistent and

23:15.950 --> 23:20.080
persuasive some even suggest that bacon

23:20.080 --> 23:22.139
was the secret author of the works of

23:22.139 --> 23:24.929
William Shakespeare and hid the original

23:24.929 --> 23:26.809
handwritten manuscripts of Shakespeare's

23:26.809 --> 23:29.080
plays on Oak Island for safekeeping

23:29.080 --> 23:33.600
I was very dismissive of the bacon

23:33.600 --> 23:35.350
theory until I actually started doing

23:35.350 --> 23:37.081
some research why is everybody so

23:37.081 --> 23:39.229
enamored of this guy well if you if you

23:39.229 --> 23:42.259
ask a traditional academic is greatest

23:42.259 --> 23:43.519
accomplishment was he founded the

23:43.519 --> 23:45.090
scientific method he was the father of

23:45.090 --> 23:47.149
empiricism but he was also a statesman

23:47.149 --> 23:50.610
and philosopher but those who are the

23:50.610 --> 23:52.600
true Baconian and especially the ones

23:52.600 --> 23:54.520
that have followed him in those days and

23:54.520 --> 23:56.849
now is because he was like a christ-like

23:56.849 --> 23:58.769
figure he was a spiritual master who was

23:58.769 --> 24:01.970
teaching them all how you create did he

24:01.970 --> 24:04.259
belong to any particular order he

24:04.259 --> 24:09.380
founded the Rosicrucians although many

24:09.380 --> 24:11.720
questions remain about the elite secret

24:11.720 --> 24:14.229
society of intellectuals known as the

24:14.229 --> 24:17.440
Rosicrucians there are many who believe

24:17.440 --> 24:19.140
they had a strong connection to the

24:19.140 --> 24:21.679
Knights Templar and that they came into

24:21.679 --> 24:23.960
possession of some of the Templars most

24:23.960 --> 24:26.899
sacred treasures including the Ark of

24:26.899 --> 24:30.190
the Covenant the Holy Grail and the

24:30.190 --> 24:32.489
golden menorah that once stood in King

24:32.489 --> 24:33.489
Solomon's Temple

24:33.489 --> 24:37.869
is it possible that Sir Francis Bacon

24:37.869 --> 24:40.489
could have come to Oak Island to hide

24:40.489 --> 24:42.409
not only the manuscripts of William

24:42.409 --> 24:45.240
Shakespeare but also precious religious

24:45.240 --> 24:48.119
relics from the Holy Land he was a

24:48.119 --> 24:50.960
member of the Royal Society as well as

24:50.960 --> 24:52.499
you know founded the room he was

24:52.499 --> 24:54.549
essentially in the bedrock of the Royal

24:54.549 --> 24:57.179
Society when there was this almost

24:57.179 --> 24:59.239
religious cult of devotion around them

24:59.239 --> 25:01.749
but when I actually started looking at

25:01.749 --> 25:03.489
what the facts were I realized man

25:03.489 --> 25:05.999
there's just so much that seems like it

25:05.999 --> 25:08.659
could be connected to Oak Island I just

25:08.659 --> 25:09.679
have to find it hard to believe that

25:09.679 --> 25:12.019
people go to this much effort to hide a

25:12.019 --> 25:14.899
treasure of gold that it had to be

25:14.899 --> 25:22.220
something gained a bunch of books well I

25:22.220 --> 25:23.830
you know I think you could find people

25:23.830 --> 25:24.909
who would say that Shakespeare's

25:24.909 --> 25:27.110
manuscripts are more worth a hundred

25:27.110 --> 25:33.820
times per ounce what gold is know if you

25:33.820 --> 25:35.359
if you actually have shakes there's

25:35.359 --> 25:37.070
manuscripts I would find the gold and

25:37.070 --> 25:39.599
give you their way to them okay I deal

25:39.599 --> 25:41.399
has been struck yeah ten times

25:41.399 --> 25:45.720
Bacon's seminal work was New Atlantis

25:45.720 --> 25:47.749
which was the description of a paradise

25:47.749 --> 25:50.090
that would be created in North America

25:50.090 --> 25:52.549
utopian a utopia

25:52.549 --> 25:54.350
that would be created in North America

25:54.350 --> 25:56.450
that would be finally the perfect

25:56.450 --> 25:59.070
society when you look at the stuff that

25:59.070 --> 26:01.200
bacon wrote one of the sections in

26:01.200 --> 26:03.259
Silvis alarm is a description of how to

26:03.259 --> 26:05.360
create a perpetual spring and the very

26:05.360 --> 26:08.149
first line of instruction is dig a pit

26:08.149 --> 26:11.070
upon the seashore they say find the high

26:11.070 --> 26:13.239
ground near the seashore to start and

26:13.239 --> 26:15.179
then we have a system of tunnels I mean

26:15.179 --> 26:18.710
it it sounds like he's describing a

26:18.710 --> 26:20.570
pilot

26:20.570 --> 26:23.139
if I was gonna pursue a theory if I was

26:23.139 --> 26:26.239
in your place I would go with the bacon

26:26.239 --> 26:30.879
theory and follow it

26:30.879 --> 26:33.570
Randall's theory that bacon did this

26:33.570 --> 26:36.419
it's surely intriguing surely very

26:36.419 --> 26:40.019
interesting bacon was a savant he was

26:40.019 --> 26:42.269
the Michelangelo of his day might he

26:42.269 --> 26:45.679
have labored to conduct this enterprise

26:45.679 --> 26:47.419
possible well Randall this has been

26:47.419 --> 26:49.000
great thank you for sharing this all

26:49.000 --> 26:51.580
with us yeah okay well we all have a lot

26:51.580 --> 27:12.250
to do let's go do it

27:12.250 --> 27:15.000
as a new day begins on Oak Island here

27:15.000 --> 27:16.000
we go

27:16.000 --> 27:18.559
Rick lagina Craig tester and members of

27:18.559 --> 27:21.049
the team are more eager than ever to

27:21.049 --> 27:23.269
continue their exploration of the

27:23.269 --> 27:26.989
mysterious borehole known as c1

27:26.989 --> 27:28.869
now that the hammer Graham has been

27:28.869 --> 27:31.230
positioned above the hole

27:31.230 --> 27:33.429
they are hoping it can retrieve evidence

27:33.429 --> 27:35.279
of the shiny metallic object they

27:35.279 --> 27:37.469
discovered when they explored the site

27:37.469 --> 27:38.469
last year

27:38.469 --> 27:44.539
yep this is it

27:44.539 --> 27:50.960
that's it with that

27:50.960 --> 27:52.219
I got a few other things crossed

27:52.219 --> 27:57.340
#NOME?

27:57.340 --> 27:59.830
is proceeding that something definitive

27:59.830 --> 28:02.840
will fall out of those jaws that one

28:02.840 --> 28:05.690
singular something will fall into that

28:05.690 --> 28:11.179
bucket and then we'll go AHA that's the

28:11.179 --> 28:12.179
hope

28:12.179 --> 28:14.110
it's always the hope it continues to be

28:14.110 --> 28:19.369
the hope here comes Dan

28:19.369 --> 28:25.900
let's come on Rick well you want to come

28:25.900 --> 28:29.080
over there it's quite an interesting

28:29.080 --> 28:31.170
development we hit the cavity at 171

28:31.170 --> 28:35.249
gotta come out take a look at

28:35.249 --> 28:46.159
we've worn those more than a few times

28:46.159 --> 28:56.330
somebody has a big head around here

28:56.330 --> 29:09.119
as the Oak Island team watches the 3-ton

29:09.119 --> 29:11.610
hammer graph tool excavate mud and

29:11.610 --> 29:16.259
debris from the bottom of Siwan

29:16.259 --> 29:18.179
they are hoping that the Spoils will

29:18.179 --> 29:20.679
contain important evidence of manmade

29:20.679 --> 29:23.960
workings Matt Charles dear all or

29:23.960 --> 29:26.460
perhaps proof that the shiny metallic

29:26.460 --> 29:28.999
object Rick and Charles spotted last

29:28.999 --> 29:36.469
year was not just an illusion hey Craig

29:36.469 --> 29:37.469
what's that

29:37.469 --> 29:39.809
or not I don't know what it is

29:39.809 --> 29:43.940
your Dan man

29:43.940 --> 29:46.570
it's black black

29:46.570 --> 29:49.980
then which that

29:49.980 --> 29:54.580
in dance more than five decades of

29:54.580 --> 29:57.409
searching for treasure on Oak Island he

29:57.409 --> 30:01.659
has seen more than anyone alive he also

30:01.659 --> 30:04.340
knows when to be dismissive of a find

30:04.340 --> 30:06.940
and when to be intrigued with it

30:06.940 --> 30:09.970
is that water or is it charcoal or what

30:09.970 --> 30:14.609
is it that is otk wood that's

30:14.609 --> 30:17.679
interesting interesting save that old

30:17.679 --> 30:21.029
decayed wood could the team have just

30:21.029 --> 30:23.320
found evidence of an ancient man-made

30:23.320 --> 30:27.710
structure some 170 feet below ground

30:27.710 --> 30:31.590
he says that's decayed wood oh ok so how

30:31.590 --> 30:33.529
do we how do we get that off my hands

30:33.529 --> 30:35.299
and into a bag

30:35.299 --> 30:48.649
I thought it was metal that thirst

30:48.649 --> 30:53.099
coming up

30:53.099 --> 30:59.749
that's the shoe

30:59.749 --> 31:12.919
that honest healthy

31:12.919 --> 31:15.940
that's interesting but that's not Vedra

31:15.940 --> 31:19.149
Rick that's the good part of it since

31:19.149 --> 31:21.460
the bedrock on this side of the island

31:21.460 --> 31:24.429
is known to be limestone and hydride the

31:24.429 --> 31:27.269
presence of this strange rock only adds

31:27.269 --> 31:29.549
to the curiosity about the nature of the

31:29.549 --> 31:35.539
mysterious underground void see what the

31:35.539 --> 31:44.729
water has done to it that's okay I have

31:44.729 --> 31:59.960
never ran into that a neurotic

31:59.960 --> 32:09.789
that one piece of rock that came up I

32:09.789 --> 32:12.830
found incredibly intriguing to me it

32:12.830 --> 32:15.119
looked like the type of rock and the

32:15.119 --> 32:17.899
type of formation in the rock that we

32:17.899 --> 32:20.769
saw in the video we saw that type of

32:20.769 --> 32:22.609
rock formation on the walls when the

32:22.609 --> 32:28.019
camera was panning around inside of your

32:28.019 --> 32:32.320
cavities yeah I'd say that that was the

32:32.320 --> 32:39.720
this was the ceiling and that was the

32:39.720 --> 32:40.720
problem

32:40.720 --> 32:51.139
oh there was something hanging right off

32:51.139 --> 32:52.139
of there

32:52.139 --> 32:53.139
we're wood or wood look at that piece

32:53.139 --> 32:54.139
yeah that's what right there big

32:54.139 --> 32:55.340
question is is this wood part of an old

32:55.340 --> 32:57.879
roof that's caved in

32:57.879 --> 33:01.269
an old roof could it be a piece of an

33:01.269 --> 33:04.659
underground tunnel or box or perhaps a

33:04.659 --> 33:06.899
piece of the wooden vault first

33:06.899 --> 33:08.869
discovered by treasure hunters William

33:08.869 --> 33:12.929
Chappell and Frederick Blair in 1897

33:12.929 --> 33:17.899
is not ours that's for damn sure cuz I

33:17.899 --> 33:21.059
never I never drilled over there yeah

33:21.059 --> 33:24.859
now this is a new cavity so I I guess is

33:24.859 --> 33:27.760
it's a great sign having the wood coming

33:27.760 --> 33:30.880
up yeah

33:30.880 --> 33:36.779
Craig more wood ceiling

33:36.779 --> 33:39.539
what is wood if it comes from that level

33:39.539 --> 33:40.539
what's it doing

33:40.539 --> 33:42.909
rather than having been introduced by

33:42.909 --> 33:47.750
some activity of a human being Craig I

33:47.750 --> 33:49.259
think what the what the big question

33:49.259 --> 33:53.039
here is what is wood doing at that depth

33:53.039 --> 33:56.159
below bedrock below virgin soil how do

33:56.159 --> 33:58.159
we explain that I mean no I think it's

33:58.159 --> 34:01.970
very encouraging I mean it there is a a

34:01.970 --> 34:03.580
ceiling that had wood on it and it's

34:03.580 --> 34:06.659
collapsed a bit then we're you know

34:06.659 --> 34:07.979
we're bringing up some of that wood

34:07.979 --> 34:10.590
that's from the class

34:10.590 --> 34:12.781
now that the hammer grab at c1 has

34:12.781 --> 34:15.418
yielded evidence that something of value

34:15.418 --> 34:17.070
could lie at the bottom of the

34:17.070 --> 34:19.710
underground void the team must figure

34:19.710 --> 34:23.340
out what to do next do they continue to

34:23.340 --> 34:25.830
blindly excavate the void which could

34:25.830 --> 34:28.520
damage or destroy precious artifacts or

34:28.520 --> 34:31.870
do they send a diver down to make a

34:31.870 --> 34:34.480
firsthand investigation we need to

34:34.480 --> 34:36.840
puzzle on how we're gonna explore this

34:36.840 --> 34:40.179
we have two lineups on our lineup an ROV

34:40.179 --> 34:42.590
any info is good info at this point my

34:42.590 --> 34:43.590
opinion

34:43.590 --> 34:46.020
the next step is to put us on our dog we

34:46.020 --> 34:47.870
need the image the cavity we have to

34:47.870 --> 34:50.560
know width breadth depth we have to get

34:50.560 --> 34:52.469
as much information as possible before

34:52.469 --> 34:54.310
we put a human being down into that

34:54.310 --> 34:56.710
cavity just have to figure it all we got

34:56.710 --> 34:58.650
more questions again today we thought

34:58.650 --> 35:03.470
we'd get some answers we got quiet Oh

35:03.470 --> 35:07.510
Skylanders maybe not tomorrow

35:07.510 --> 35:19.350
at the end of a long day that saw

35:19.350 --> 35:22.450
progress made at the c1 shaft we all

35:22.450 --> 35:24.790
want to know this object that's leather

35:24.790 --> 35:26.970
to the ceiling whether it's in the wall

35:26.970 --> 35:28.880
or something there were all convinced

35:28.880 --> 35:32.910
yeah Rick lagina Charles Barkhouse and

35:32.910 --> 35:35.931
Jack Begley gather in the oak island war

35:35.931 --> 35:38.900
room they are planning a further

35:38.900 --> 35:41.730
exploration of what could be a man-made

35:41.730 --> 35:48.250
cavity some 170 feet underground Charles

35:48.250 --> 35:50.660
I know c1 intrigued you from getting oh

35:50.660 --> 35:52.900
and now we've got this difficulty if you

35:52.900 --> 35:55.099
will about how to explore it how to find

35:55.099 --> 35:58.160
the shiny gold thing and there's only

35:58.160 --> 36:00.430
one way to get it and that's the put a

36:00.430 --> 36:03.100
diverter on the hole yeah John and

36:03.100 --> 36:06.460
Howard did an exemplary dive in 10x so

36:06.460 --> 36:07.950
we need to get them on the horn and see

36:07.950 --> 36:12.580
if they're interested absolutely last

36:12.580 --> 36:14.740
year world-renowned diver John

36:14.740 --> 36:18.220
Chatterton made the perilous 235-foot

36:18.220 --> 36:24.090
descent to the bottom of borehole 10x in

36:24.090 --> 36:26.090
an effort to help the team look for

36:26.090 --> 36:29.470
artifacts tunnels or other signs of

36:29.470 --> 36:35.660
man-made workings

36:35.660 --> 36:38.160
unfortunately this ability was virtually

36:38.160 --> 36:41.520
zero and Chatterton's findings indicated

36:41.520 --> 36:43.340
that what dan Blankenship had long

36:43.340 --> 36:45.940
believed to be a man-made chamber could

36:45.940 --> 36:50.450
be a natural formation yeah what what is

36:50.450 --> 36:56.350
that done

36:56.350 --> 36:58.810
it's far in a way more difficult than

36:58.810 --> 37:01.510
10x god forbid there's a collapse and I

37:01.510 --> 37:03.900
think if anyone can do it it's those two

37:03.900 --> 37:05.510
all right let's ring them up see what

37:05.510 --> 37:06.510
happens

37:06.510 --> 37:15.680
hey guys John Howard hooria hey guys how

37:15.680 --> 37:17.420
you doing good good

37:17.420 --> 37:19.200
joining John Chatterton on the video

37:19.200 --> 37:21.780
conference is his business partner and

37:21.780 --> 37:25.550
safety diver Howard Ehrenberg we have a

37:25.550 --> 37:28.360
proposition for you if you will awesome

37:28.360 --> 37:31.170
you guys when you left you got bit by

37:31.170 --> 37:33.160
the Oak Island bug you said you wanted

37:33.160 --> 37:36.780
to be kept in the know yeah we've been

37:36.780 --> 37:38.830
doing some digging in the money pit and

37:38.830 --> 37:41.750
one of the holes based on last year's

37:41.750 --> 37:44.300
work we thought we entered avoid a

37:44.300 --> 37:47.000
swimmable cavity that may extend into

37:47.000 --> 37:51.840
the original money pit so your question

37:51.840 --> 37:54.130
is are we interested that is our

37:54.130 --> 38:04.530
question I mean we really and truly wish

38:04.530 --> 38:08.070
you guys the greatest success in all

38:08.070 --> 38:09.070
this

38:09.070 --> 38:14.740
I see but at the same time we prefer you

38:14.740 --> 38:18.370
didn't have that great success without

38:18.370 --> 38:23.360
us so I think all right that'd be great

38:23.360 --> 38:24.360
yeah

38:24.360 --> 38:28.310
so we've dropped the 43 inch case on to

38:28.310 --> 38:30.860
get us a free access to the cavity so

38:30.860 --> 38:33.030
you wouldn't be encumbered by like TEDx

38:33.030 --> 38:35.280
the ladder the hoist rails all of that

38:35.280 --> 38:37.710
we thought we'd give you really clear

38:37.710 --> 38:41.570
dyes yeah the 43 inch caisson was

38:41.570 --> 38:43.860
anchored in the bedrock but we did pull

38:43.860 --> 38:46.360
off about 10 feet so you'd be going down

38:46.360 --> 38:50.040
through uncase rock into the cavity okay

38:50.040 --> 38:54.740
that's the last yes exactly and again at

38:54.740 --> 38:58.710
that point of entry we're not sure if

38:58.710 --> 39:01.410
there was a collapse of the ceiling so

39:01.410 --> 39:03.820
there are a lot of questions it

39:03.820 --> 39:07.101
certainly seems as though it's it's a

39:07.101 --> 39:11.350
dynamic environment yes it's it's like

39:11.350 --> 39:15.011
whether it's stable how or not figure it

39:15.011 --> 39:18.250
out okay there was one other thing that

39:18.250 --> 39:21.020
we noticed John as Rick said we hit this

39:21.020 --> 39:24.310
void at two 171 and they put a camera

39:24.310 --> 39:27.300
down and it appeared to show this shiny

39:27.300 --> 39:30.310
gold thing but we're concerned that did

39:30.310 --> 39:33.100
the caisson drop this gold object

39:33.100 --> 39:38.810
somewhere down in the muck sure yes the

39:38.810 --> 39:42.650
other part of the investigation aspect

39:42.650 --> 39:44.970
of this hole we'd like to drop blue view

39:44.970 --> 39:47.560
sonar down there and get a 3d computer

39:47.560 --> 39:48.920
model of it what

39:48.920 --> 39:51.260
else we can come up with in as much of

39:51.260 --> 39:52.930
the knowns out of that hole as possible

39:52.930 --> 39:55.220
and then you guys decide let's see what

39:55.220 --> 39:58.250
it looks like with number one the sonar

39:58.250 --> 40:00.340
and and then decide whether we really

40:00.340 --> 40:02.420
need to make an exploratory dive or we

40:02.420 --> 40:04.640
can feel like we've know enough that we

40:04.640 --> 40:06.860
get right to work all right Joan and

40:06.860 --> 40:09.200
Howard are committed even without a

40:09.200 --> 40:11.640
complete understanding of what limited

40:11.640 --> 40:15.000
information we have I say move ahead put

40:15.000 --> 40:17.820
them in the hole thank you both very

40:17.820 --> 40:18.820
much

40:18.820 --> 40:20.360
appreciate it we're excited man all

40:20.360 --> 40:24.640
right thanks Carol see ya I would love

40:24.640 --> 40:26.750
to find something of monetary value that

40:26.750 --> 40:29.790
would be great but to get some answers

40:29.790 --> 40:33.160
would be sort of the de minimis wish

40:33.160 --> 40:36.400
let's at least get some answers for Rick

40:36.400 --> 40:39.590
Marty and the Oak Island team the dream

40:39.590 --> 40:41.870
of making an important discovery in the

40:41.870 --> 40:46.620
ce-1 shaft may soon become a reality

40:46.620 --> 40:48.290
armed with both video footage of a

40:48.290 --> 40:51.100
mysterious gold colored object and

40:51.100 --> 40:53.120
physical evidence of a possible wooden

40:53.120 --> 40:55.980
structure there is reason to believe

40:55.980 --> 40:58.070
that the laginas and their partners

40:58.070 --> 41:00.110
could be on the verge of a major

41:00.110 --> 41:01.110
breakthrough

41:01.110 --> 41:04.090
but if so what will they find

41:04.090 --> 41:07.370
a chest containing the priceless

41:07.370 --> 41:10.720
manuscripts of William Shakespeare a

41:10.720 --> 41:13.140
wooden vault filled with stolen gold

41:13.140 --> 41:20.220
or we'll see one proved to be a deadly

41:20.220 --> 41:21.220
trap

41:21.220 --> 41:22.220
one that will give to the island yet

41:22.220 --> 41:29.210
another human trophy next time on the

41:29.210 --> 41:32.220
curse of Oak Island I think we explored

41:32.220 --> 41:34.970
10x no no wait wait why do you guys keep

41:34.970 --> 41:36.790
hanging on to this because I believe

41:36.790 --> 41:39.050
let's put this machine is yeah let's get

41:39.050 --> 41:41.530
it all I still am puzzled by what's in

41:41.530 --> 41:43.600
the bottom of 10x yeah still see the

41:43.600 --> 41:45.090
square target I think it's still in the

41:45.090 --> 41:47.500
same position John Chatterton is back

41:47.500 --> 41:50.530
hopefully he can put his eyes on the

41:50.530 --> 41:54.950
target he's got something on the metal

41:54.950 --> 41:56.010
detector

41:56.034 --> 41:58.034
