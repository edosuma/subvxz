00:04.420 --> 00:06.300
Well, I've enjoyed being here.

00:08.140 --> 00:09.740
Has the share price moved?

00:09.740 --> 00:11.580
The Australian market
opens in an hour.

00:11.580 --> 00:12.900
Well, don't get greedy.

00:12.900 --> 00:14.380
I do know what I'm doing.

00:14.380 --> 00:16.940
If that were the case, I wouldn't
have to bail you out, would I?

00:16.940 --> 00:20.620
My Australian counterpart and I
have today agreed terms

00:20.620 --> 00:23.420
on a trade deal that will be
of enormous benefit

00:23.420 --> 00:24.900
to both our countries.

00:24.900 --> 00:26.580
What the fuck is she playing that?

00:26.580 --> 00:28.660
We're going to come up with
a story right now

00:28.660 --> 00:33.180
that neither of you two will deviate
from in the slightest detail.

00:33.180 --> 00:36.380
Lloyd's got one concern
beyond himself, and that's Tom.

00:36.380 --> 00:39.500
He'd sell you down the river
if the price was right.

00:39.500 --> 00:42.620
You're saying you and Tom didn't
dump Sophie's body in the harbour?

00:42.620 --> 00:44.380
That must have been Lloyd.

01:23.700 --> 01:26.620
Casper, Freddie, in here now!
Yeah, yeah.

01:26.620 --> 01:28.940
No, no. That's exactly
what I told him.

01:28.940 --> 01:31.100
Dishwasher.

01:31.100 --> 01:32.700
Yeah, well, that sounds good.

01:32.700 --> 01:34.300
OK.

01:36.300 --> 01:37.460
Yeah, sure.

01:39.860 --> 01:42.180
OK, Daddy's ready,
so get your stuff!

01:42.180 --> 01:44.340
Sweetheart, I'm in a hurry today.
You're gonna have to take them.

01:44.340 --> 01:45.580
I'm sorry.
You always do this.

01:45.580 --> 01:47.300
Thank you so much. Mwah!

01:47.300 --> 01:49.460
Boys, have a good day.

01:49.460 --> 01:51.300
Hey, Max.
Hello, mate.

01:53.660 --> 01:56.260
It's me.
WOMAN: I was about to call you.

01:56.260 --> 01:57.860
Oh, yeah? Why?

01:57.860 --> 01:59.740
Lloyd needs to be held to account.

01:59.740 --> 02:02.580
But he'll just deny it all, and
then it's his word against Oscar's.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.660
And who are people
going to believe -

02:04.660 --> 02:06.820
a billionaire or a drug dealer?

02:06.820 --> 02:08.300
Why were you calling me?

02:08.300 --> 02:12.700
Because I was thinking the same
thing, and I've had an idea.

02:12.700 --> 02:15.940
How we can stack the odds
a bit more in our favour.

02:15.940 --> 02:17.660
Ooh, sorry, just hang on a sec.

02:18.980 --> 02:21.540
Mmm. I've got to go.

02:24.740 --> 02:26.060
See you later.
Yeah.

02:26.060 --> 02:29.180
Max.
How soon can you be in work?

02:30.740 --> 02:34.140
MAN: The Guardian says you've put
food standards back a decade.

02:34.140 --> 02:36.380
Yes, I'll hold.

02:36.380 --> 02:39.100
The Telegraph says you're
finally prioritising

02:39.100 --> 02:40.380
the interests of industry.

02:40.380 --> 02:41.820
Yes, I get the idea, Ben.

02:41.820 --> 02:45.660
I'm the darling of the right,
my own side thinks I'm a traitor.

02:45.660 --> 02:47.100
Yeah, that's about the size of it.

02:50.460 --> 02:52.300
Yes, I'm still here.

02:52.300 --> 02:54.220
OK, everyone, you've
all seen the media.

02:54.220 --> 02:57.820
They're killing us on trade now, OK?
We need to shift the agenda.

02:57.820 --> 02:58.940
I want you to...

02:58.940 --> 03:00.660
Abigail Crawford.
Again?

03:00.660 --> 03:02.380
Alright, here's an idea.

03:02.380 --> 03:03.740
Find someone who just
lost their house

03:03.740 --> 03:05.540
because they couldn't make
their mortgage payments.

03:05.540 --> 03:07.820
Ideas like that. Let's go!

03:07.820 --> 03:10.940
Abigail? I'm a little busy
putting out the fires you started.

03:10.940 --> 03:12.980
Look, I just want
the chance to explain.

03:12.980 --> 03:15.420
You played me, Abigail,
right from the fucking start.

03:15.420 --> 03:17.940
Greg, please. It's not like that.

03:17.940 --> 03:20.060
Six o'clock, your hotel.

03:56.500 --> 03:59.740
Uh...thanks for coming, bro.

03:59.740 --> 04:01.220
I wasn't sure you would.

04:02.420 --> 04:04.100
I don't know why I have.

04:07.940 --> 04:09.860
Find out why you've betrayed us.

04:09.860 --> 04:12.380
I would never do that to you, bro.
You know that.

04:12.380 --> 04:14.940
Then why get your own lawyer
and go to the police?

04:16.220 --> 04:19.260
Mate, I would trust you with my life.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.620
But your dad...

04:22.980 --> 04:24.620
Does he know you're meeting me?

04:24.620 --> 04:27.500
Shit no. You're dead to him.

04:30.420 --> 04:32.380
What have you told the police?

04:32.380 --> 04:35.340
The truth. That it was your dad
who moved Sophie's body.

04:35.340 --> 04:37.540
So to save yourself,
you've dobbed me in, huh?

04:37.540 --> 04:40.180
I told you I wouldn't betray you.

04:43.340 --> 04:44.580
Did you tell 'em I hit her?

04:45.780 --> 04:46.860
Mate, don't say that.

04:48.340 --> 04:49.860
It was an accident.

04:49.860 --> 04:53.620
(OVER SPEAKERS) You lashed out,
Sophie just got in the way.

04:53.620 --> 04:54.980
I was angry at you.

04:57.740 --> 04:59.460
I hated her.

05:02.660 --> 05:04.300
I meant to hit her.

05:04.300 --> 05:06.100
It was an accident.

05:07.180 --> 05:08.460
Can we agree on that?

05:08.460 --> 05:10.340
Why? What does it matter?

05:10.340 --> 05:13.700
I went to the police to clear me,
not to get you in trouble.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.540
I won't be in any trouble.

05:17.140 --> 05:19.540
Dad says I have nothing to fear.

05:21.220 --> 05:24.300
He has evidence that proves
that I didn't kill her.

05:24.300 --> 05:26.500
What evidence?
I don't know.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.140
He just said he has a trump card

05:28.140 --> 05:29.460
and he'll play it
if he ever needs to.

05:33.660 --> 05:35.180
I've got to get back to work.

05:36.220 --> 05:38.660
You're thinking manslaughter,
aren't you?

05:38.660 --> 05:41.340
Well, he admits hitting her...
with intent.

05:43.500 --> 05:45.460
Good work, Oscar.
Fuck you.

05:47.100 --> 05:48.180
And you.

05:55.700 --> 05:58.660
MAX: How could Lloyd be sure
Tom didn't kill Sophie?

05:58.660 --> 06:01.820
Because she was still alive
when he got there.

06:01.820 --> 06:03.420
You think Lloyd killed her?

06:03.420 --> 06:05.700
Sorry.
He could have.

06:05.700 --> 06:08.460
Oscar's admitted that he stole
the laptop on Lloyd's orders.

06:08.460 --> 06:11.220
So Lloyd knew Sophie
had dirt on him,

06:11.220 --> 06:13.740
he just didn't know what.

06:13.740 --> 06:18.260
Yeah, but at the time
of Sophie's death,

06:18.260 --> 06:20.420
Lloyd didn't know that Oscar
had got the wrong laptop.

06:20.420 --> 06:23.380
He thought that problem was fixed.

06:23.380 --> 06:26.220
Insurance? In case
Sophie had a backup.

06:27.900 --> 06:32.380
Maybe Sophie was still alive
when the boys left,

06:32.380 --> 06:34.180
but dead by the time Lloyd got there.

06:34.180 --> 06:35.620
Yeah, but how would he know?

06:37.300 --> 06:38.820
The security cameras.

06:38.820 --> 06:40.260
Do you think
he still has the footage?

06:40.260 --> 06:42.140
He has to.
But why?

06:42.140 --> 06:44.100
If it shows him dumping
her body in the harbour?

06:44.100 --> 06:46.580
It's like you said, insurance.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.500
Lloyd hopes that he'll
never have to use it.

06:48.500 --> 06:50.220
But in the worst-case scenario,

06:50.220 --> 06:52.100
if Tom is convicted
of killing Sophie...

06:52.100 --> 06:55.020
You think Lloyd would give
himself up to save his son?

06:55.020 --> 06:57.580
Well, you would. For Louis.

06:57.580 --> 06:59.620
If that footage exists...

06:59.620 --> 07:01.460
Oh, it exists alright.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.900
Perhaps Justin
would like to tag along.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.420
No, I think he should stay
to take a note of this meeting.

07:25.420 --> 07:28.700
Oh, I thought this was just
an informal chat.

07:31.420 --> 07:34.060
Um, should I stay or...

07:34.060 --> 07:35.980
Tell Simon you'll be down in a bit.

07:46.500 --> 07:50.540
I realise my accommodation
on the trade deal must have come

07:50.540 --> 07:52.020
as something of a surprise.

07:52.020 --> 07:56.620
You handed the government a big win
right when I had them on the ropes.

07:56.620 --> 08:01.180
It was necessary for
domestic political purposes.

08:01.180 --> 08:02.660

Chatham House Rules.

08:10.300 --> 08:11.420
Cone of silence.

08:16.860 --> 08:19.100
The deal is less than we hoped for,

08:19.100 --> 08:21.620
but the PM can still
present it as a triumph,

08:21.620 --> 08:22.820
the benefit of Brexit.

08:22.820 --> 08:26.100
Bullshit, of course,
but it buys him some time.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.740
Why would you help him?

08:28.740 --> 08:30.380
His job's yours for the taking.

08:30.380 --> 08:33.500
Not all politicians
are quite so Machiavellian.

08:33.500 --> 08:36.980
No, but you are.
I know you, remember?

08:43.060 --> 08:45.140
Sophie's death is still raw.

08:46.740 --> 08:48.660
We're not ready for the leadership.

08:49.700 --> 08:52.660
I've decided to give
the PM my backing,

08:52.660 --> 08:56.500
and in return he's promised
to make me Foreign Secretary.

into each other's eyes?

Yeah.

11:20.140 --> 11:21.700
Those nephews...

11:22.780 --> 11:25.340
..they asked whether you'd
tell them a bedtime story.

11:26.500 --> 11:27.980
Sure.

11:47.060 --> 11:48.580
I can't be arsed to read this,

11:48.580 --> 11:51.180
so why don't you just tell me
what it's about?

It's a warrant allowing us
to search your office and home

He's invited us to lunch
tomorrow to celebrate.

12:35.460 --> 12:38.140
You'd have made even more
if you'd kept your share options

12:38.140 --> 12:40.180
in Lloyd's company.

12:40.180 --> 12:42.260
I imagine they've risen in value.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.020
Considerably.

12:45.300 --> 12:48.860
But I have a slight confession
to make there.

12:48.860 --> 12:50.980
I never sold out my position.

12:52.620 --> 12:57.620
I know, I know,
but it's just as well I didn't.

the incriminating evidence

I'm not.

Have you?

15:48.740 --> 15:50.380
Yes.

15:50.380 --> 15:53.900
In my job, it's inevitable.
Now stop procrastinating and play.

15:53.900 --> 15:57.460
I don't know what that means.
Well, you're very good at it.

15:57.460 --> 15:59.500
I'll be taking you to school, boys.

15:59.500 --> 16:01.940
Where's Daddy?
He's had to go away for work.

16:01.940 --> 16:04.020
Max has seen a dead body.

16:04.020 --> 16:06.620
Five more minutes, then you
need to have your breakfast.

16:10.260 --> 16:12.180
Right, off you go.

16:13.660 --> 16:18.260
(PLAYS FALTERINGLY)

16:24.220 --> 16:27.140
Don't worry, there's always
one bit I struggle with.

16:27.140 --> 16:29.620
But I'm not doing it wrong.

16:29.620 --> 16:31.100
Well, it doesn't
sound right, does it?

16:34.620 --> 16:36.660
(POUNDS KEY)

16:40.380 --> 16:44.420
Ooh...mystery solved.

16:44.420 --> 16:45.620
Rex!

16:49.100 --> 16:51.660
Keep going. Very good.

16:54.220 --> 16:56.700
(RINGING TONE)

16:56.700 --> 16:57.700
MEG: Hello?

16:57.700 --> 16:59.540
I know where Lloyd's
hidden the footage.

17:01.020 --> 17:04.620
The last time I was here, you said
that I was your second visitor.

17:04.620 --> 17:07.220
Mm.
Was the first Lloyd Macklin?

17:07.220 --> 17:08.860
Yes. Yes, it was.

17:08.860 --> 17:11.420
Did you notice him
hide anything in the piano?

17:11.420 --> 17:12.860
Oh, well, that explains it.

17:15.340 --> 17:16.580
Explains what?

17:16.580 --> 17:20.820
I was dusting and I found
this little red box

17:20.820 --> 17:23.060
lodged amongst the strings,
very odd.

17:26.100 --> 17:28.300
What did you do with it, Marjorie?

17:28.300 --> 17:31.340
Yes, well, that's
a very good question.

17:32.780 --> 17:33.780
Let me think.

17:38.820 --> 17:40.340
Hmm, complete blank.

17:40.340 --> 17:41.860
Let's start in the kitchen.

17:41.860 --> 17:43.540
Marjorie, take a seat,
enjoy your cup of tea.

17:54.120 --> 17:57.040
Ben, what are you doing here?
Surely you weren't invited.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.000
I've had word from London.

18:00.000 --> 18:03.080
One of the tabloids has another clip
of the PM with his wife,

18:03.080 --> 18:05.880
this time shouting,
"You stupid cow."

18:05.880 --> 18:08.560
Were they on a farm?
On a train?

18:09.880 --> 18:11.120
And not cattle class.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.240
It's the final nail in his coffin.

18:15.240 --> 18:18.440
I'm told he's going to announce
his resignation 6am London time.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.120
Seriously?
What?

18:20.120 --> 18:21.600
This is your moment.

18:24.680 --> 18:27.840
It's too soon.
Well, it may not come again.

18:34.640 --> 18:36.080
We should work on a press release.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.360
What's she doing?

18:49.400 --> 18:50.800
Preparing for power.

18:59.280 --> 19:01.040
Are you sure you've kept it?

19:01.040 --> 19:02.560
Might it be out in the bins?

19:02.560 --> 19:06.160
Oh, I never throw anything away.
Could it be out in the garage?

19:06.160 --> 19:08.600
I can't remember
the last time I was in there.

19:08.600 --> 19:10.320
Yes, but that doesn't
rule it out, does it?

19:16.320 --> 19:18.200
(SIGHS) Max.

19:22.440 --> 19:24.400
Oh, that's it! That's it.

19:24.400 --> 19:26.960
I thought it would make
a lovely coaster.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.400
Oh.
Mwah.

19:38.040 --> 19:40.160
Alright, let's see what we've got.

19:58.280 --> 20:00.480
I have told you that
that meant nothing.

20:00.480 --> 20:02.240
Nor did it when I fucked Oscar.

20:03.480 --> 20:06.080
(LAUGHS)

20:06.080 --> 20:08.320
We were both wasted.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.760
(LAUGHS) Seriously?

20:16.840 --> 20:17.840
You fucked her.

20:22.520 --> 20:23.520
Boys!

20:30.760 --> 20:33.520
(MEN ROAR)
Get off him! Get off him!

20:41.240 --> 20:42.960
Fuck.

20:42.960 --> 20:45.480
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.920
Bro, I think she's dead.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.680
Fuck!

20:51.080 --> 20:52.280
Fuck.
Sophie.

20:53.440 --> 20:55.080
I can't feel a pulse.

20:58.280 --> 21:00.160
(RINGING TONE)

21:00.160 --> 21:02.160
Dad...Dad...Dad, there's been
a fight and I've hit Sophie.

21:02.160 --> 21:04.640
She's hit her head. She's...

21:04.640 --> 21:06.520
She's dead, Dad. We've killed her.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.160
OK. OK, we've gotta go.

21:09.160 --> 21:11.680
We've gotta call an ambulance.
Dad says that we should go.

21:11.680 --> 21:13.120
We've gotta go.

21:13.120 --> 21:15.200
Mate, for FUCK'S sake. Come on.

21:17.720 --> 21:18.720
Busted.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.000
What's the time code on that?

21:22.200 --> 21:24.520
Uh...11:47:23.

21:24.520 --> 21:28.600
Fast forward to 12:30. It's
around then that Lloyd came home.

21:54.720 --> 21:57.080
We've got him.

21:57.080 --> 21:58.360
Yeah.

22:01.160 --> 22:02.160
Good.

22:03.560 --> 22:05.440
Send it out now.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.960
Are you coming in?
They're just serving up.

22:15.600 --> 22:17.200
This is where Sophie died.

22:19.320 --> 22:20.840
It's what the police think.

22:22.320 --> 22:23.560
No, I know.

22:25.960 --> 22:26.960
For a fact.

22:32.320 --> 22:35.800
I don't care how fancy the lawyers
are, they're going away for this.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.280
We're missing something.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.320
What time did Lloyd arrive?

22:41.360 --> 22:44.000
12:32:43.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.640
Freeze-frame that moment, will you?

22:47.320 --> 22:50.160
Now cut to 11:47:23.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.160
Search.

22:51.160 --> 22:53.120
Can we see the two images
side by side?

22:57.600 --> 22:59.040
She's moved.

22:59.040 --> 23:01.640
She wasn't dead when the boys left.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.600
We need to watch it all.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.240
Paea, play the part we skipped.

23:05.240 --> 23:09.120
How long have you known that
Sophie's not your daughter?

23:13.080 --> 23:15.160
Well, I knew about
your affair with Greg.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.160
You must have considered me
really stupid

23:20.160 --> 23:21.800
if you thought I didn't.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.440
I wanted to believe Sophie was mine.

23:27.240 --> 23:31.000
But after she saw you in Singapore,
she came and told me.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.160
It's called hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy. Greg has it too.

23:38.040 --> 23:40.320
So I'm not your father?

23:40.320 --> 23:42.440
Yes.

23:42.440 --> 23:44.520
I'm more focused on the fact
that I might die at any moment.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.280
But if you want to
make it about you...

23:46.280 --> 23:48.480
Well, it affects both of us,
doesn't it?

23:52.720 --> 23:54.880
She told me it didn't
change anything.

23:58.320 --> 23:59.640
Maybe not for her.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.320
Is that Lloyd?

24:10.320 --> 24:12.480
No, it's too early.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.280
Oh, my God.

24:30.960 --> 24:33.560
Lloyd had footage from the CCTV.

24:33.560 --> 24:35.520
What? What are you talking about?

24:35.520 --> 24:37.400
The cameras weren't working.

24:37.400 --> 24:39.120
He played it for me.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.040
He wanted to make sure

24:44.040 --> 24:46.960
I signed the trade deal
on terms that suited him.

24:54.520 --> 24:55.800
Why were you here?

24:59.280 --> 25:01.000
Why were you here, Simon?

25:07.080 --> 25:10.520
Sophie had called me
earlier that week.

25:10.520 --> 25:13.800
Dad, Lloyd Macklin is bad news.

25:13.800 --> 25:15.880
you shouldn't be doing
business with him.

25:15.880 --> 25:18.280
What? What are you talking about?

25:18.280 --> 25:20.400
SIMON: She'd stumbled on
a cache of documents

25:20.400 --> 25:22.360
while she was interning with Lloyd.

25:22.360 --> 25:24.560
I got her to email them to me.

25:24.560 --> 25:26.960
She had certificates that Lloyd's
sheep were reared to

25:26.960 --> 25:29.720
the highest standards,
not pumped full of hormones.

25:30.800 --> 25:34.680
Simon, these certificates are fake.
What?

25:34.680 --> 25:37.040
I sent them to the South Americans.
Yes, I know.

25:37.040 --> 25:39.200
They won't pay as high a price
if they don't think we've got

25:39.200 --> 25:40.440
access to the British markets.

25:40.440 --> 25:41.520
Look, I'll call Sophie

25:41.520 --> 25:44.080
and I'll encourage her
to destroy all the files.

25:44.080 --> 25:46.000
SIMON: We couldn't risk
that getting out.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.800
So Lloyd told Oscar to go
and steal Sophie's laptop.

25:50.800 --> 25:53.520
SOPHIE: Someone broke into our
apartment. They wanted my laptop.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.040
I'm sure that's not true, darling.

25:55.040 --> 25:57.840
Lloyd must have spotted the missing
documents, and I've got them.

25:58.840 --> 26:01.200
I'm going to leak it all.
Animal liberation, the media...

26:01.200 --> 26:04.480
No, you mustn't do that.
I stand to lose a lot of money.

26:04.480 --> 26:07.560
Money? Is that all you care about?

26:07.560 --> 26:09.840
Please. We'll talk about this.

26:09.840 --> 26:13.720
I'm going to tell the world
about Lloyd, all his dirty secrets.

26:13.720 --> 26:17.880
SIMON: I told Sophie that I'd see
her soon, and we'd discuss it then.

26:17.880 --> 26:20.960
But I didn't trust Sophie
to keep quiet.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.360
I was panicking.

26:24.360 --> 26:28.200
I needed that sale
just as much as Lloyd.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.640
So I decided to fly back to Sydney.

26:32.760 --> 26:35.440
Lloyd has a private plane
available 24/7.

26:35.440 --> 26:37.160
He'd given me the key to his house.

26:37.160 --> 26:40.040
I planned to stay the night and
phone Sophie the next morning.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.120
When I got here...

26:52.800 --> 26:54.680
..I saw her lying on the patio.

26:58.400 --> 26:59.920
Oh, Jesus, Sophie.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.640
SIMON: I had no idea
what had happened.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.600
I thought Lloyd must have
set someone on her.

27:08.840 --> 27:10.200
She was dying.

27:11.720 --> 27:13.400
She was barely still alive.

27:15.600 --> 27:16.600
Hmm...

27:18.280 --> 27:19.280
Dad...

27:20.920 --> 27:22.200
She called me Dad.

27:25.240 --> 27:28.240
It was the worst thing
she could have said,

27:28.240 --> 27:30.200
because I wasn't her father.

27:32.120 --> 27:33.320
I never had been.

27:36.920 --> 27:39.520
I looked at her and I saw Greg.

27:40.600 --> 27:43.320
It was like they were
both mocking me.

27:44.880 --> 27:47.360
And if that wasn't bad enough...

27:48.760 --> 27:50.960
..she was going to
destroy me as well.

27:54.960 --> 27:56.920
After everything I've done for her?

28:03.480 --> 28:05.400
I couldn't let that happen.

28:06.920 --> 28:07.920
So...

28:30.040 --> 28:33.960
We thought he was in the bush.
He made calls from there.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.960
Around the time of the murder?

28:35.960 --> 28:39.400
He made a call from
Winston Station at 6:13pm

28:39.400 --> 28:41.560
and then 5:39 the next morning.

28:41.560 --> 28:44.280
There's a landing strip
on the property.

28:44.280 --> 28:47.720
It's a six-hour round trip.
It's possible.

28:47.720 --> 28:50.320
We know it's possible. He did it.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.080
If Macklin knew that Simon Chalcott
murdered Sophie,

28:55.080 --> 28:57.480
then why would he keep it
to himself?

28:57.480 --> 28:59.400
Knowledge is power.

29:00.560 --> 29:02.560
To be used when it's
to your best advantage.

29:04.760 --> 29:08.400
You knew...but you haven't
called the police.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.080
Nor has Lloyd.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.840
He won't while you still
have use to him.

29:21.280 --> 29:23.280
And is that why you haven't either?

29:25.560 --> 29:28.000
Is being PM that important to you?

29:34.040 --> 29:36.640
I will be prime minister,

29:36.640 --> 29:38.920
and when I am,

29:38.920 --> 29:42.920
not immediately but
when the time is right,

29:42.920 --> 29:48.160
I will divorce you and you will
accept it without question.

29:49.800 --> 29:52.360
Now stay out of my FUCKING sight.

30:15.232 --> 30:18.312
This will need to be handled
with some sensitivity.

30:24.952 --> 30:27.272
Tash, could you get me
the commissioner, please?

30:27.272 --> 30:28.432
Thank you.

30:34.712 --> 30:37.792
I take it this was
a...joint effort?

30:39.352 --> 30:42.312
Yes, sir.
Very much so.

30:42.312 --> 30:47.232
DS Drummond, perhaps you should be
the one to inform Abigail Crawford.

30:49.472 --> 30:50.952
Yes, sir.

31:07.872 --> 31:09.272
Is Ms Crawford here?

31:10.632 --> 31:13.072
She's about to do an interview.
Oh, no, she isn't.

31:13.072 --> 31:15.352
I need to speak to her.

31:15.352 --> 31:16.352
In private.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.152
ANDREW: Thank you for coming in.

31:35.152 --> 31:37.272
SIMON: Of course.

31:37.272 --> 31:40.352
You said you had some
important information.

31:40.352 --> 31:42.272
We know who killed Sophie.

31:44.192 --> 31:45.312
You do?

31:46.312 --> 31:47.872
Have you laid charges?

31:49.472 --> 31:51.192
We're about to.

31:51.192 --> 31:54.552
Simon Chalcott, I'm arresting you
for the murder of Sophie Chalcott.

31:54.552 --> 31:57.272
You're not obliged to say anything
unless you wish to do so,

31:57.272 --> 31:59.872
but whatever you say may later
be used in evidence.

32:01.592 --> 32:03.592
MAX: I'm so sorry.

32:03.592 --> 32:05.552
This must come as an awful shock.

32:07.752 --> 32:08.752
Where's Ben?

32:11.712 --> 32:13.152
He's outside.

32:15.632 --> 32:19.152
Have him come in, will you?
I'll need some time alone with him.

32:22.512 --> 32:25.032
Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course.

32:51.912 --> 32:54.472
as to whether the matter
will be proceeded with.

32:54.472 --> 32:57.072
Please tell them I'm so sorry.

32:57.072 --> 32:59.712
..so occasioning grievous
bodily harm

32:59.712 --> 33:02.272
and conspiracy to pervert
the course of justice.

33:07.672 --> 33:10.512
OK, now, this had better
be important.

33:10.512 --> 33:12.072
Oh, I think it is.

33:12.072 --> 33:15.192
Lloyd Macklin, I'm arresting you
for interfering with human remains,

33:15.192 --> 33:16.952
hindering an investigation,

33:16.952 --> 33:19.472
and conspiracy to pervert
the course of justice.

33:24.872 --> 33:26.952
MAX: How did press
get there so quickly?

33:28.472 --> 33:32.312
I guess someone must have
tipped them off.

33:34.912 --> 33:37.032
Are you doing anything
Saturday arvo?

33:37.032 --> 33:40.312
Mm, by the sounds of it.

33:40.312 --> 33:42.312
Would you like to come
watch Louis' footy game?

33:43.792 --> 33:47.432
Saturday sport,
it's a bit of an Aussie tradition.

33:47.432 --> 33:50.712
I mean, you don't have to.
I fully understand...

33:50.712 --> 33:52.992
Meg...I'd love to.

33:55.272 --> 33:56.272
OK.

33:56.272 --> 33:59.032
REPORTER: The arrest is believed
to be in relation to the murder

33:59.032 --> 34:00.272
of Sophie Chalcott.

34:00.272 --> 34:03.912
Lloyd Macklin's son, Tom,
was Sophie Chalcott's boyfriend

34:03.912 --> 34:05.392
at the time of her death.

34:05.392 --> 34:07.552
(TURNS OFF TV) Congratulations.

34:07.552 --> 34:10.152
Your lot are all over the news.
Why, thank you.

34:12.992 --> 34:15.072
Hamish not in?
No.

34:24.552 --> 34:25.552
Are you and he...

34:26.912 --> 34:28.352
Fine, yeah.

34:30.912 --> 34:32.032
Getting divorced.

34:33.752 --> 34:34.752
Not because of me?

34:35.792 --> 34:37.312
You flatter yourself.

34:41.032 --> 34:42.232
But yes.

34:43.672 --> 34:45.552
I mean, not you specifically, but...

34:47.232 --> 34:48.512
..you opened my eyes.

34:52.352 --> 34:54.712
So you've cracked the case.
You'll be going home, then.

34:59.552 --> 35:00.552
I wish I were.

35:03.832 --> 35:05.032
Not because of me?

35:07.752 --> 35:09.032
YOU flatter yourself.

35:15.552 --> 35:16.552
Yeah.

35:19.392 --> 35:21.112
(DOOR OPENS)

35:22.192 --> 35:23.392
Mummy...

35:24.832 --> 35:27.592
.I. had a bad dream.

35:27.592 --> 35:28.592
OK.

35:30.032 --> 35:31.312
Come on, pickle.

35:35.792 --> 35:39.072
After this extended stay in Sydney,

35:39.072 --> 35:42.432
I shall soon be returning
to London with my daughter,

35:42.432 --> 35:44.872
where I can finally lay her to rest.

35:44.872 --> 35:46.952
That poor woman.

35:46.952 --> 35:48.632
My husband's arrest came, as...

35:48.632 --> 35:50.952
(JUSTIN SNIGGERS)
Christ's sake, Justin.

35:50.952 --> 35:52.832
..a devastating shock.

35:52.832 --> 35:55.232
To think that Sophie's own father
could do such a thing

35:55.232 --> 35:58.032
is beyond comprehension.

35:59.312 --> 36:01.832
While this matter is before
the courts,

36:01.832 --> 36:03.272
I can make no further comment.

36:04.832 --> 36:08.792
I shall focus on public service

36:08.792 --> 36:12.792
and fulfilling whatever role
my party decides I should play.

36:12.792 --> 36:14.032
Thank you.

36:14.032 --> 36:16.472
REPORTER: The frontrunner to become
the next British prime minister...

36:20.952 --> 36:23.472
Whatever you wish to say,
you can say in front of Ben.

36:27.032 --> 36:29.552
Were you aware of your husband's
involvement in Sophie's death

36:29.552 --> 36:31.112
before you heard it from me?

36:32.592 --> 36:36.392
Because when I told you,
you didn't seem that surprised.

36:39.352 --> 36:43.952
There were no questions,
no sort of refusal to believe.

36:48.792 --> 36:50.872
Your first thought was
to ask for Ben.

36:54.352 --> 36:56.152
I think you already knew.

37:04.832 --> 37:06.912
And if I did know
and didn't tell you...

37:09.992 --> 37:12.992
Well, then you'd be guilty of
perverting the course of justice,

37:12.992 --> 37:14.752
facing many years in prison.

37:22.352 --> 37:24.072
I won't lie to you, Max.

37:26.632 --> 37:29.192
When I entered
the House of Commons...

37:32.832 --> 37:37.632
..I was shocked to discover
that all most MPs cared about

37:37.632 --> 37:39.272
was being re-elected.

37:40.832 --> 37:43.832
Surely we were there
to make a difference.

37:43.832 --> 37:44.832
I was.

37:45.912 --> 37:50.352
But even as a minister...
I had no real power.

37:52.312 --> 37:54.592
Not to move the country
in a new direction.

37:56.032 --> 37:57.872
Only the prime minister can do that.

38:00.632 --> 38:02.632
Which is why I need the top job.

38:04.552 --> 38:07.872
So I can do what
I went into politics for.

38:11.192 --> 38:13.232
To help those less fortunate.

38:14.792 --> 38:16.352
Those without a voice.

38:18.712 --> 38:20.472
The victims, if you will.

38:28.792 --> 38:30.872
You didn't answer my question.

38:30.872 --> 38:32.672
I didn't promise to.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.392
I simply said I wouldn't lie.

38:49.792 --> 38:53.272
You think Abigail Crawford
would protect her daughter's killer?

38:53.272 --> 38:54.752
She was protecting herself.

38:55.952 --> 38:59.032
She almost admitted as much.
(WHISTLE BLOWS)

38:59.032 --> 39:01.112
(CROWD CHEERS)

39:03.752 --> 39:05.672
If Abigail knew,

39:05.672 --> 39:09.192
either Lloyd Macklin or
Simon Chalcott told her...

39:09.192 --> 39:12.912
They might testify against her
in return for a reduced sentence.

39:12.912 --> 39:14.432
Bugger that.

39:14.432 --> 39:15.432
Two meat pies.

39:17.272 --> 39:19.512
Still, if I'm right, she's
guilty of withholding evidence.

39:22.112 --> 39:23.112
Thanks.

39:27.272 --> 39:29.792
Here. Another Aussie tradition.

39:31.592 --> 39:33.312
Sauce?

39:35.992 --> 39:37.632
Uh, yeah, sure.

39:38.712 --> 39:41.312
Be careful, they're quite...

39:42.792 --> 39:44.752
Jesus. Fuck. (MUTTERS)

39:44.752 --> 39:46.552
..hot.

39:46.552 --> 39:47.952
Do you want me to charge her?

39:49.112 --> 39:53.272
The woman's lost her daughter
and her husband.

39:53.272 --> 39:54.952
Do you think she'd make
a good prime minister?

39:56.392 --> 39:58.472
She might.

39:58.472 --> 40:00.672
If we charge her,
you'll never find out.

40:00.672 --> 40:02.912
This will destroy
her career as well.

40:05.272 --> 40:08.432
So, should I call you
Prime Minister-elect?

40:08.432 --> 40:09.632
A little premature.

40:09.632 --> 40:11.392
Oh, no-one's foolish enough
to oppose you.

40:12.592 --> 40:16.152
The omens are good,
as they are for you.

40:16.152 --> 40:19.952
Yes. As long as I can avoid
any mishaps for the next five days.

40:24.832 --> 40:26.992
Oh, what are they doing here?

40:26.992 --> 40:29.152
It's possible they've
come to arrest me.

40:31.312 --> 40:32.432
I'll leave you to it.

40:32.432 --> 40:33.512
Detectives.

40:35.352 --> 40:37.832
Max. Detective Sergeant.

40:39.192 --> 40:41.472
To what do I owe this pleasure?

40:43.312 --> 40:45.232
We've come to wish you
a safe flight.

40:51.192 --> 40:53.552
Well, thank you. Both.

40:55.272 --> 40:58.792
And thank you for everything
you've done for Sophie.

41:01.032 --> 41:02.512
We should go through.

41:15.072 --> 41:17.752
MAX: Hi.
Hiya.

Kids not in?

41:19.552 --> 41:22.312
Casper's at piano lessons,
Freddie's playing upstairs.

41:29.312 --> 41:34.032
I... (CLEARS THROAT) ..had a meeting
with the boss earlier.

41:34.032 --> 41:37.632
They've offered me
a secondment here in Sydney.

41:38.912 --> 41:40.792
That's a surprising development.

41:40.792 --> 41:45.192
It would be for a year, initially.

41:45.192 --> 41:47.112
Wow.

41:47.112 --> 41:48.632
Yeah.

41:49.872 --> 41:52.032
What did you tell them?

41:52.032 --> 41:53.472
I told them I'd have to
think about it.

41:55.832 --> 41:57.232
Would you like me to stay?

41:58.872 --> 42:01.992
Would you LIKE to stay?
Uh, no, no, no. I asked first.

42:01.992 --> 42:04.192
Yeah, but I'm not five,
so that doesn't count.

42:08.992 --> 42:09.992
I would.

42:11.672 --> 42:12.832
I'd like you to.

42:33.032 --> 42:35.032
(DOORBELL CHIMES)

I got your email and I just thought,
"What are we doing? This is crazy."
