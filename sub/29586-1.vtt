[music on stereo]

01:32.040 --> 01:34.377

- Something wrong?

01:35.109 --> 01:36.879
No, everything's fine.

01:38.914 --> 01:40.514
Well, feel free to let me know
if there's something

01:40.516 --> 01:42.516
I could be doing better.

01:42.518 --> 01:43.749
I've been having a hard time

01:43.751 --> 01:45.519
getting any calls from agencies,
so...

01:45.521 --> 01:48.654
Yeah, I'm not surprised
you're having a hard time.

01:48.656 --> 01:50.659
- Why is that?
- 'Cause...

01:51.959 --> 01:53.726
You're, you're playing it
too safe.

01:53.728 --> 01:56.562
I mean, it-it's-it's vanilla.
Boring.

01:56.564 --> 01:58.734
I'll tell you what. Let me take
a look at your portfolio.

02:03.138 --> 02:05.575

- [sighs]

02:13.147 --> 02:15.816
Yup, same.

02:15.818 --> 02:18.552
These make you look like
you're trying to book gigs

02:18.554 --> 02:21.620
for retail ads
in the Sunday paper.

02:21.622 --> 02:23.656
Do you really want this?

02:23.658 --> 02:25.058
More than anything in the world.

02:25.060 --> 02:26.560
Then you're gonna have
to step up your game.

02:26.562 --> 02:28.564
Show a little more skin.

02:31.066 --> 02:32.865
I don't know.
It's not really me.

02:32.867 --> 02:34.667
[mumbles] Never mind,
I don't think you have

02:34.669 --> 02:36.136
what it takes
to make it in this industry.

02:36.138 --> 02:40.176
You know, working models,
they take risks.

02:43.110 --> 02:44.513
Wait.

[music on stereo]

That's more like it.

02:58.593 --> 03:00.629
All right, now step back
into the light.

03:02.197 --> 03:03.432
Hm.

03:08.770 --> 03:10.807
You do have what it takes.

03:11.939 --> 03:13.942
Now you gotta start to feel it.

03:16.711 --> 03:19.214
All right. Head up just
a little bit, shoulders back.

03:20.949 --> 03:23.953
Yeah, make it look like
you love this.

03:28.090 --> 03:29.891
Take your top off.

03:30.526 --> 03:32.058
What?

03:32.060 --> 03:34.160
Don't be a prude, I've got
connections with magazines

03:34.162 --> 03:36.662
that'll pay you some
really good money for nude pics.

03:36.664 --> 03:38.665
You mean, like, porn?

03:38.667 --> 03:39.865
Dude, no way!

03:39.867 --> 03:41.800
Tasteful nudity has made,

03:41.802 --> 03:45.939
made girls like you very rich.

03:45.941 --> 03:48.574
[scoffs] Look, just give me back
the photo card.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.010
You already have my money.

03:50.012 --> 03:52.578
We can get
some really good pictures.

03:52.580 --> 03:54.049
It's up to you.

03:56.651 --> 03:58.019
Think about it.

03:59.054 --> 04:01.254
I can change your life.

04:01.256 --> 04:05.725
I can help you
become very, very wealthy.

04:05.727 --> 04:07.163
It's your choice.

04:12.067 --> 04:13.736
I'm out of here.

04:17.738 --> 04:18.940
Sweetie...

04:19.942 --> 04:21.944
I can help you go places.

04:25.781 --> 04:29.182
Didn't you check the guy out
before you gave him your money?

04:29.184 --> 04:31.250
Uh, yeah,
I mean, his ad looked legit

04:31.252 --> 04:33.887
and he was the only one
I could afford.

04:33.889 --> 04:35.255
Now I guess I know why.

04:35.257 --> 04:37.324
I mean, I still don't get it.

04:37.326 --> 04:39.726
Why do you want this so bad?

04:39.728 --> 04:42.628
You're an amazing artist.

04:42.630 --> 04:44.897
Okay, you should come to school
with me in Miami.

04:44.899 --> 04:46.899
You've been talking to my mom
again, haven't you?

04:46.901 --> 04:48.601
I just think
you're really talented.

04:48.603 --> 04:50.269
And I don't think
you should throw it all away.

04:50.271 --> 04:53.639
I'm not throwing anything away.

04:53.641 --> 04:57.344
Matt, I was
the bucktooth military brat

04:57.346 --> 04:58.844
who moved from base to base.

04:58.846 --> 05:01.714
Completely invisible.

05:01.716 --> 05:04.084
I got through it by burying
myself in fashion magazines,

05:04.086 --> 05:06.889
just dreaming of being
one of those girls one day.

05:09.124 --> 05:10.326
Okay.

05:14.262 --> 05:15.730
I love you.

05:20.735 --> 05:22.368
Grace.

05:22.370 --> 05:25.204
Matt, what do you want me
to say?

05:25.206 --> 05:26.772
I'd like you to say something
that makes me

05:26.774 --> 05:28.108
feel like you care about me.

05:28.110 --> 05:30.709
I'm just not ready to say it
right now, okay?

05:30.711 --> 05:32.081
You know this.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.752
I'm sorry.

05:44.026 --> 05:45.858
- Hey. Ready?
- Hey.

05:45.860 --> 05:48.831
Oh, no. I have to work
another hour. Lisa's sick.

05:49.865 --> 05:52.031
Well, you wanna wait for me?

05:52.033 --> 05:55.135
Um, no, I'll just take the bus.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.139
How did your photo shoot go?

05:57.973 --> 05:59.938
It was good.

05:59.940 --> 06:01.274
You know,
it's not too late to tell

06:01.276 --> 06:02.875
the college you're enrolling.

06:02.877 --> 06:04.810
I mean, tomorrow's the cut-off.

06:04.812 --> 06:07.447
You could always model
part-time.

06:07.449 --> 06:09.748
Tomorrow's also the cut-off
for us to keep having

06:09.750 --> 06:11.750
this conversation
over and over again.

06:11.752 --> 06:14.187
I told you already,
that's not how it works.

06:14.189 --> 06:16.822
If I'm gonna do this,
I have to be all in.

06:16.824 --> 06:19.392
Honey, there are
a million girls, just like you,

06:19.394 --> 06:21.394
all trying to be stars.

06:21.396 --> 06:22.861
Thank you, mom.

06:22.863 --> 06:24.831
No, look, I know what it's like

06:24.833 --> 06:27.367
to have your head in the clouds
and everything's great,

06:27.369 --> 06:30.870
but... I just can't stand here
and watch you throw away

06:30.872 --> 06:32.471
an incredible opportunity.

06:32.473 --> 06:34.873
You just really don't believe
in me, do you?

06:34.875 --> 06:37.209
Honey, that... No, that is
not at all what I'm saying...

06:37.211 --> 06:39.745
Mom, this is what I want, okay?

06:39.747 --> 06:42.848
I-I just love you,
I love you so much.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.420

to come with him.

a lot of convincing.

from here.

- Sure.
- Yeah.

You know what?
Stand right there.

13:28.423 --> 13:31.523
- Right now?
- Yeah. Right now.

13:31.525 --> 13:34.227
Shouldn't I put on some makeup
or something?

I just...

14:05.527 --> 14:09.665
I have one rule. One... rule.

14:12.167 --> 14:14.802
Totally slipped my mind.
Won't happen again.

I'm sorry,
I have a deathly nut allergy,

14:21.909 --> 14:23.575
and sometimes I go nuts.

14:23.577 --> 14:26.512
- Totally understand.
- Cool.

Let's just shake it off, okay?

some more of that.

14:49.370 --> 14:50.670
Okay.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.772
We are out of Chianti.

14:52.774 --> 14:54.773
Nicole, would you mind
running to the store for me?

14:54.775 --> 14:56.408
- Sure.
- Oh.

14:56.410 --> 14:58.677
Um, I'm actually pretty tired.

14:58.679 --> 15:00.912
Is there any way you could
drive me to the apartment now?

15:00.914 --> 15:04.249
Nicole will be right back
and then she'll take you, right?

15:04.251 --> 15:06.685
Well, it's a pretty long drive,

15:06.687 --> 15:08.954
so I should probably go back.

15:08.956 --> 15:11.159
I'll be right back. Promise.

15:12.427 --> 15:13.461
Okay.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.401
Food is my vice.
I don't do a lot of drinking.

15:22.403 --> 15:24.469
And my friends,

15:24.471 --> 15:26.405
I had a bunch of friends
who passed away from drugs

15:26.407 --> 15:27.739
in this business, so...

15:27.741 --> 15:29.242
Oh, um, Nicole mentioned

15:29.244 --> 15:31.576
that you helped her out
with that.

15:31.578 --> 15:33.878
Yeah, she's doing a lot better.

15:33.880 --> 15:35.918
It's all about empowerment.

15:38.653 --> 15:40.652
You know, a lot of people
see modeling

15:40.654 --> 15:43.656
as vain and mindless...

15:43.658 --> 15:46.425
but when I look through the lens
at my subjects,

15:46.427 --> 15:48.497
I see them come alive.

15:49.496 --> 15:51.597
Confidence grows.

15:51.599 --> 15:53.201
Like, you today.

15:55.302 --> 15:57.306
There's power
in the photos I take.

15:59.006 --> 16:01.409
I never really thought about it
that way.

16:02.277 --> 16:03.809
Well, here's to you.

16:03.811 --> 16:06.911
Small-town girl
became a superstar.

16:06.913 --> 16:08.283
[Grace] Yeah.

16:09.616 --> 16:11.953
Well, I hope
I don't disappoint you.

16:14.621 --> 16:16.224
It's not possible.

16:17.859 --> 16:18.924
[Hunter] The model
stuck her tongue out

16:18.926 --> 16:20.693
at the very last minute.

16:20.695 --> 16:22.494
And it made the cover.

16:22.496 --> 16:24.497
Oh, my God!

16:24.499 --> 16:27.333
- Yeah, I know.
- [clears throat]

16:27.335 --> 16:29.301
Hey, what happened to Nicole?

16:29.303 --> 16:31.606
Oh, yeah, right. Let me check.

16:33.006 --> 16:34.674
Ah.

16:34.676 --> 16:37.376
Oh, I missed her text.
She, uh...

16:37.378 --> 16:39.480
She's not feeling well,
so she went home.

16:40.380 --> 16:42.580
Uh, what should I do?

16:42.582 --> 16:43.848
We have a guesthouse
in the back.

16:43.850 --> 16:45.854
The models use it all the time.

16:49.456 --> 16:50.290
All right.

16:51.926 --> 16:54.026
[Grace] It's so pretty here
at night.

16:54.028 --> 16:55.897
- Yeah, right?
- Hm.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.667
[doorknob rattling]

17:02.669 --> 17:04.373
[door creaks]

17:15.450 --> 17:17.415
Hm?

17:17.416 --> 17:19.352
- It's nice.
- Mm-hmm, told you so.

17:19.354 --> 17:20.388
Hm.

17:24.892 --> 17:27.759
<i>Anna Karenina. Scarlet Letter.</i>

17:27.761 --> 17:29.461
You have a thing
for empowered women.

17:29.463 --> 17:32.000
Yeah, like I said, empowerment.

17:34.067 --> 17:35.901
You should have
everything you need.

17:35.903 --> 17:39.638
Coffee maker's in there,
towel, hairdryer.

17:39.640 --> 17:41.907
I know I'm being silly,
but would you mind

17:41.909 --> 17:43.712
just checking for a car?

17:44.846 --> 17:46.647
- Of course.
- Thanks.

17:47.815 --> 17:49.815
[dial pad beeps]

17:49.817 --> 17:52.854
There are no cars nearby. Sorry.

17:54.756 --> 17:57.055
Well, I guess I can stay

17:57.057 --> 17:59.124
for just one night.

17:59.126 --> 18:02.330
All right.
See you bright and early.

18:02.797 --> 18:03.964
Okay.

18:04.664 --> 18:06.097
Oh.

18:06.099 --> 18:08.133
Don't forget to lock the door.

18:08.135 --> 18:09.538
Hm...

18:13.007 --> 18:14.907
[exhales sharply]

18:14.909 --> 18:17.379
Oh! My bag.

18:18.413 --> 18:19.614
[exhales sharply]

18:22.115 --> 18:23.748
- [knocking on door]
- Hunter?

18:23.750 --> 18:26.355
[intense music]

18:27.521 --> 18:28.756
Hello?

18:35.563 --> 18:37.566
[scoffs] Of course.

18:48.108 --> 18:50.578
Hunter! Hello?

18:54.915 --> 18:56.384
Hunter!

19:13.166 --> 19:15.968
Hi, I'm trapped in a guesthouse
outside of Miami,

19:15.970 --> 19:18.671
but I don't know the address.
Can you help me?

19:18.673 --> 19:22.173
Get comfortable.
You're gonna be here a while.

19:22.175 --> 19:24.612

19:25.512 --> 19:28.649

- Hello?

19:45.098 --> 19:47.600
[knocking on door]

19:47.602 --> 19:49.067
[Matt] So you just haven't heard
anything?

19:49.069 --> 19:53.073
No. No, maybe
something will strike you.

19:56.009 --> 19:59.079
I mean, I hate to go through
her stuff, but...

20:01.015 --> 20:03.151
I already went through that,
there's nothing there.

20:05.553 --> 20:09.188
I mean, I guess I could go
through her computer, but...

20:09.190 --> 20:11.990
Matt, this is all my fault.
I pushed college too hard.

20:11.992 --> 20:13.825
You can't blame yourself,
Ms. Somerville.

20:13.827 --> 20:16.728
Okay, I did the same thing. We
spoke the other night about it.

20:16.730 --> 20:18.963
It's just hard not to be
overprotective, you know,

20:18.965 --> 20:21.702
knowing that she's out there
by herself.

20:23.703 --> 20:26.707
[footsteps approaching]

20:30.278 --> 20:31.610
Rise and shine, beautiful.

20:31.612 --> 20:32.814
[gasps]

20:34.582 --> 20:37.181
- What do you want from me?
- Eat first.

20:37.183 --> 20:38.284
[clears throat]

20:38.286 --> 20:41.921
I'm not hungry. I wanna go home.

20:41.923 --> 20:44.222
This is your home now.

20:44.224 --> 20:46.528
I think it's a great home,
by the way.

20:49.997 --> 20:52.834
Don't even look at it.
The door's locked.

20:54.969 --> 20:57.803
If you let me leave,
I p-promise I won't tell anyone.

20:57.805 --> 20:59.738
You'll never see me again.

20:59.740 --> 21:02.076
But I have such big plans
for us!

21:02.910 --> 21:04.079
Look.

21:09.784 --> 21:11.650
Some of my past stars.

21:11.652 --> 21:13.955
You're gonna have
your very own TV channel.

21:16.257 --> 21:19.227
Wanna know the name?
<i>Lonely College Girl.</i>

21:20.760 --> 21:23.696
You're finally gonna be a model,
Grace.

21:23.698 --> 21:27.132
Don't worry. Don't worry.
We'll start off slow.

21:27.134 --> 21:31.170
No nudity to begin with.
It'll be like a movie trailer.

21:31.172 --> 21:34.776
We hook 'em. We reel 'em in.

21:35.343 --> 21:37.176
You're insane.

21:37.178 --> 21:39.644
I will never do that.

21:39.646 --> 21:42.748
Every day you'll perform
a new theme.

21:42.750 --> 21:45.049
What sets us apart
from every other site

21:45.051 --> 21:47.119
is that you're almost like
a girlfriend

21:47.121 --> 21:50.322
to the rest of our viewers
around the world.

21:50.324 --> 21:51.856
There's a bittersweet beauty

21:51.858 --> 21:54.295
in convincing people
of false intimacy.

21:56.297 --> 21:58.633
All of our girls
stayed here before.

21:59.967 --> 22:01.333
Where are they now?

22:01.335 --> 22:02.968
They're doing great.

22:02.970 --> 22:05.336
Europe, Asia.

22:05.338 --> 22:08.208
I would rather die
than ever do this.

[cell phone beeps]

22:20.086 --> 22:22.854
[dramatic music]

22:22.856 --> 22:25.958
You love your mother, don't you?

22:25.960 --> 22:28.096
How do I know
you didn't pre-record that?

22:29.763 --> 22:31.263
[line ringing]

22:31.265 --> 22:34.636
Walk past her mother.
Drop a napkin.

22:39.673 --> 22:41.707
[Hunter] That's not magic.

22:41.709 --> 22:43.311
That's happening now.

22:45.278 --> 22:48.846
You have the power
to keep your mother safe...

22:48.848 --> 22:52.620
if you just do what I say
and accept this.

22:53.688 --> 22:55.353
Okay?

22:55.355 --> 22:57.722
I'm gonna need this, though.

22:57.724 --> 22:59.224
I'm gonna need
all your security passwords

22:59.226 --> 23:00.992
and your social media.

23:00.994 --> 23:03.097
- Never.
- Never?

23:06.933 --> 23:09.336

23:17.411 --> 23:18.977
Good girl.

23:18.979 --> 23:20.446
Now, your family's
not gonna be thrilled

23:20.448 --> 23:22.213
with your new occupation,

23:22.215 --> 23:23.915
but they'll get over it
eventually.

23:23.917 --> 23:25.284
Oh, and one other thing.

23:25.286 --> 23:28.253
I disconnected
your cellular signal.

23:28.255 --> 23:29.921
Not traceable.

23:29.923 --> 23:31.457
We're a team now.

23:31.459 --> 23:34.125
We're gonna have fun. Come on.

23:34.127 --> 23:37.996
Your, uh, alter-egos
are all hanging in there.

23:37.998 --> 23:40.201
Great. Pick it out.

23:42.470 --> 23:44.372
We go live in 15.

23:45.372 --> 23:46.775
Now?

23:47.340 --> 23:48.742

Well, I guess...

At least we know she's okay.

26:38.645 --> 26:41.479
I know, but it's so unlike her
not to call.

26:41.481 --> 26:43.515
All right,
well, I'm gonna message her now.

26:43.517 --> 26:46.250
Okay. Just let me know

29:57.678 --> 30:00.048
because I scramble
the IP address every hour.

30:02.215 --> 30:04.217
Honestly...

30:05.249 --> 30:06.287
that's what
the delay button is for.

30:08.588 --> 30:10.822
I'm not an unreasonable guy.
I'm not.

30:10.824 --> 30:15.259
I know how tough it can be
for the first time.

30:15.261 --> 30:19.430
But the more you do it,
the more comfortable you'll get.

30:19.432 --> 30:21.766
I know it's the first time
you've done this.

30:21.768 --> 30:23.270
I understand.

30:24.304 --> 30:26.307
But I'll be there to guide you.

30:26.874 --> 30:28.276
Okay?

30:31.310 --> 30:34.314
[line ringing]

30:36.782 --> 30:39.286
Grace, please.

30:40.253 --> 30:41.655
Please call me.

30:43.156 --> 30:44.826
I need to know you're okay.

31:04.443 --> 31:07.511
[singsong]
We have something to celebrate!

31:07.513 --> 31:09.449
[chuckles]

31:10.550 --> 31:12.385
Anyway...

31:13.554 --> 31:14.818
We...

31:14.820 --> 31:17.655
You are a hit.

31:17.657 --> 31:20.558
The most views for a debut yet.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.594
The <i>Scared College Girl</i> worked.

31:22.596 --> 31:24.595
This is so great.

31:24.597 --> 31:27.532
I can see your storyline now.

31:27.534 --> 31:30.434
Timid to temptress.

31:30.436 --> 31:32.671
[chuckles] Yeah.
Have your bourbon.

31:32.673 --> 31:34.442
I don't want any.

31:37.711 --> 31:41.682
Oh, come on! A little bit.
It's time to enjoy.

31:44.483 --> 31:46.918
Okay, fine. Suit yourself.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.923
It's a $100 a bottle.

31:51.557 --> 31:54.593
[sighs] Yeah.

31:54.595 --> 31:58.296
Books are such a great escape,
aren't they?

31:58.298 --> 32:01.967
You know what?
We should do a librarian theme.

32:01.969 --> 32:05.469
We haven't done that yet.
Bun, glasses.

32:05.471 --> 32:07.605
[scoffs]

32:07.607 --> 32:09.210
It'd be great!

32:10.943 --> 32:13.277
It's quiet enough in here.

32:13.279 --> 32:15.682
- [glass shatters]
- Who-o-a!

32:16.817 --> 32:18.618
Okay.

32:19.486 --> 32:20.755
Okay.

32:21.855 --> 32:24.724
Just take this away from you.

32:28.362 --> 32:30.665
I don't think
my message is being...

32:31.999 --> 32:33.867
clear enough to you.

32:36.502 --> 32:38.505
Let me show you something.

32:39.373 --> 32:40.875
Take a look at this.

32:42.409 --> 32:43.975
Beats one of my better photos.

32:43.977 --> 32:46.710
- What did you do to her?
- Only what I had to.

32:46.712 --> 32:49.780
It's very simple how things
work around here, Grace.

32:49.782 --> 32:53.017
Do what I say
and you'll have a good life.

32:53.019 --> 32:55.886
Don't do what I say
and you won't.

32:55.888 --> 32:57.791
You're a celebrity now.

32:59.326 --> 33:01.492
We go live tomorrow.

33:01.494 --> 33:04.296
Get some rest. Oh...

33:04.298 --> 33:06.530
And a bomb blast
won't scratch that.

33:06.532 --> 33:08.732
So the lamp probably won't,
either.

[door shuts]

33:24.384 --> 33:26.287
Why the long face?

33:27.953 --> 33:30.455
You told me
when the last girl left

33:30.457 --> 33:34.359
that the next one wouldn't
take up so much of your time.

33:34.361 --> 33:36.327
What about our plans
to run away to Mexico, huh?

33:36.329 --> 33:37.964
Why are we still here?

33:39.066 --> 33:40.965
This is what I do.

33:40.967 --> 33:42.770
- Hm.
- You know that.

33:44.770 --> 33:46.837
She's gonna run her course
just like the rest of the girls,

33:46.839 --> 33:48.643
then I'll cut her loose.

33:53.946 --> 33:55.348
[sighs]

33:59.952 --> 34:02.086
I care about you, you know that.

34:02.088 --> 34:04.055
[scoffs]

34:04.057 --> 34:06.059
I don't know.
It's hard to tell sometimes.

34:08.362 --> 34:10.463
I rescued you
when nobody else would.

34:11.364 --> 34:12.899
I kept your secret.

34:20.639 --> 34:22.976
All this I do, I do for you.

34:24.643 --> 34:27.681
We'll be together forever.
I promise.

34:29.916 --> 34:31.318
Hm?

34:52.572 --> 34:53.774
[moans]

35:00.146 --> 35:01.813
- Easy. Easy, Hunter.
- You know...

35:01.815 --> 35:03.113
You know you want it, Grace.

35:03.115 --> 35:04.719
Grace?

35:05.652 --> 35:07.688
[panting]

35:08.855 --> 35:10.655
Oh, my God. You called me Grace.

35:10.657 --> 35:12.757
I have a lot on my mind.

35:12.759 --> 35:14.628
I don't believe you.

35:17.431 --> 35:19.032
- Come here.
- No.

35:31.210 --> 35:33.580
[exhales] You can do this.

35:34.713 --> 35:35.882
[sighs]

35:40.586 --> 35:44.023
Okay, remember,
timid to temptress.

35:47.193 --> 35:49.760
We go live...

35:49.762 --> 35:53.465
in five, four, three,

35:53.467 --> 35:55.833
two, one...

35:55.835 --> 35:56.867
Action.

35:56.869 --> 35:59.873
[instrumental music on stereo]

36:01.740 --> 36:03.043
[Hunter] Great.

36:11.918 --> 36:14.151
That's more like it, Grace.

36:14.153 --> 36:15.188
Yes.

37:57.690 --> 38:00.925
Yeah. And what about you?

38:00.927 --> 38:04.932
As long as she keeps doing
what she's doing, I'm happy.

38:07.967 --> 38:09.769
I'm going for a run.

38:33.893 --> 38:36.664
Matt, I'm coming to Miami.

[doorknob rattling]

[door lock beeping]

39:03.123 --> 39:05.289
Nicole? Thank God.

39:05.291 --> 39:07.659
We have to get out of here.
Hunter has me trapped!

39:07.661 --> 39:11.396
Stop leading him on.
You're not his girlfriend.

39:11.398 --> 39:13.798
What are you talking about?
Get out of my way!

39:13.800 --> 39:15.333
What are you doing?

39:15.335 --> 39:17.235
Hunter and I don't have secrets.

39:17.237 --> 39:18.802
You're in on this?

39:18.804 --> 39:20.338
Ho-how could you be with him?

39:20.340 --> 39:22.273
He-he trapped me and he
killed someone! He's the one.

39:22.275 --> 39:25.112
He's the best thing that's ever
happened to me. I love him.

39:37.456 --> 39:40.724
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where do you think you're going?

39:40.726 --> 39:42.693
- She tried to kill me.
- She attacked me.

39:42.695 --> 39:45.896
Nicole,
what are you doing in here?

39:45.898 --> 39:48.099
Oh, you've got to set
some boundaries with her.

39:48.101 --> 39:50.168
How many times
have I told you?

39:50.170 --> 39:53.170
- Comparison is the thief of joy.
- [scoffs]

39:53.172 --> 39:56.175
Now go inside and think about
what you've done.

40:03.349 --> 40:06.186
And don't ever come out here
again without my permission.

40:14.059 --> 40:15.793
Don't worry about her.

40:15.795 --> 40:18.195
She's weak.

40:18.197 --> 40:20.233
She does this
with all the new girls.

40:21.367 --> 40:24.101
You're what matters now.

40:24.103 --> 40:26.369
[sighs] What if she tries
to hurt me again?

40:26.371 --> 40:28.408
She won't. I promise.

40:30.275 --> 40:32.342
Thank you for saving me.

40:32.344 --> 40:34.311
I really thought
she was gonna kill me.

40:34.313 --> 40:36.380
What did Nicole say to you?

40:36.382 --> 40:38.385
That I'm leading you on.

40:39.485 --> 40:40.920
Are you?

40:46.126 --> 40:47.325
Did you like that?

40:47.327 --> 40:49.863
That wa... That was nice.

40:53.199 --> 40:54.432
You're smarter
than the other girls.

40:54.434 --> 40:56.437
You remind me of my mother.

40:59.838 --> 41:01.873
You'd never leave me alone,
would you?

41:01.875 --> 41:03.844
- Never.
- [chuckles]

- [door shuts]
- [door lock beeps]

41:18.123 --> 41:21.358
Okay, you say she's been texting
the both of you.

41:21.360 --> 41:22.994
Right?

41:22.996 --> 41:25.061
Posting photos
all over social media

41:25.063 --> 41:28.099
from some, uh,
modeling-gig thing she's at?

41:28.101 --> 41:31.202
But somehow you think
something happened to her.

41:31.204 --> 41:34.171
Yes, Grace would never go this
long without talking to me.

41:34.173 --> 41:35.505
Well, how long has it been?

41:35.507 --> 41:37.009
Two weeks.

41:38.577 --> 41:41.278
Oh, no. Please don't look at me
like that.

41:41.280 --> 41:43.981
Call it a mother's intuition,
whatever.

41:43.983 --> 41:45.182
I know something's wrong.

41:45.184 --> 41:46.516
No, I'm telling you,
she's right.

41:46.518 --> 41:48.452
Look, Grace wouldn't do
something like this.

41:48.454 --> 41:49.954
Mm-mm.

41:49.956 --> 41:54.191
You know...
do you ever just think

41:54.193 --> 41:56.295
that maybe she doesn't want
to be found?

41:57.429 --> 42:00.430
Look, the...

42:00.432 --> 42:02.599
The longest that I have gone
w-with not speaking

42:02.601 --> 42:05.869
with my daughter...
has been one week,

42:05.871 --> 42:08.405
and that was because
she was at summer camp.

42:08.407 --> 42:11.911
So, please, detective,
you have to help us find her.

42:13.579 --> 42:17.949
Look, all the evidence points
to her being alive and well,

42:17.951 --> 42:20.016
and so...

42:20.018 --> 42:21.619
- [mumbles]
- I...

42:21.621 --> 42:23.253
I wish there was more
I could do, but...

42:23.255 --> 42:24.856
W-w-w-what about her computer?

42:24.858 --> 42:26.190
- Can't you just go through her...
- I brought it...

42:26.192 --> 42:27.858
No, I brought it with me,
it's in the car.

42:27.860 --> 42:30.161
No. No, I can't.
I need a warrant for that.

42:30.163 --> 42:31.494
What about tracking her phone?
I mean...

42:31.496 --> 42:33.496
At least I'll know for sure
she's in Miami.

42:33.498 --> 42:35.535
I mean, I pay the bill.
It's a joint account.

42:36.536 --> 42:38.269
S...

42:38.271 --> 42:41.104
So-so that's it? That...

42:41.106 --> 42:45.242
I thought the police
were supposed to help people.

42:45.244 --> 42:48.144
[sobbing] I mean, what...

42:48.146 --> 42:49.546
What if she's being kidnapped?

42:49.548 --> 42:51.481
I mean, she...
T-taken out the country?

42:51.483 --> 42:54.017
- Just...
- No. Y-you don't know, you're...

42:54.019 --> 42:55.519
Now there's no evidence
to point to that.

42:55.521 --> 42:57.354
- Why don't you help me?
- No. No-no.

42:57.356 --> 42:59.123
There's no evidence that points
to that, okay?

42:59.125 --> 43:01.057
[sobbing] Why don't you help?

43:01.059 --> 43:03.864
You don't know... Oh, my God...

43:07.300 --> 43:09.266
I-it's like he didn't even care.

43:09.268 --> 43:11.302
I know. But listen, we're not
gonna give up on her, all right?

43:11.304 --> 43:13.170
I'm gonna stay on him
every single day.

43:13.172 --> 43:14.505
This is a nightmare, Matt.

43:14.507 --> 43:17.144
I know. I know.
What are you gonna do now?

43:18.610 --> 43:21.278
[sobbing]
I'm gonna stay in Miami.

43:21.280 --> 43:23.583
Did you see all those girls
on the wall?

43:26.351 --> 43:28.422
If he's not gonna find her,
I am...

43:30.088 --> 43:31.554
even if I have to go
to every photography studio

43:31.556 --> 43:32.990
in this place.

43:32.992 --> 43:36.626
Hey. I'm gonna help you, okay?

43:36.628 --> 43:39.362
We're gonna find her. Come here.

43:39.364 --> 43:41.200

44:05.625 --> 44:07.157
What's all this?

44:07.159 --> 44:10.161
You never told me
it was your birthday.

44:10.163 --> 44:13.430
[sighs] I didn't realize...

44:13.432 --> 44:15.499
No calendars in here.

44:15.501 --> 44:18.105
- Yeah, there's none of those.
- Yeah.

44:21.074 --> 44:22.342
Open it.

44:40.525 --> 44:42.528
It's not gonna bite you.

44:53.773 --> 44:56.043
- It's beautiful.
- Put it on.

45:00.313 --> 45:01.682
Be right back.

45:06.018 --> 45:07.320
[door shuts]

45:28.407 --> 45:29.675
[door opens]

45:31.376 --> 45:33.644
I love it.

45:33.646 --> 45:36.249
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

45:41.086 --> 45:42.289
[Hunter] Wow.

45:43.056 --> 45:45.822

45:45.824 --> 45:48.027

[inhales sharply]

46:05.277 --> 46:08.280
[dramatic music]

46:11.650 --> 46:13.652
You look amazing.

46:17.322 --> 46:19.389
You're the first girl
that I've ever considered...

46:19.391 --> 46:22.628
I want us to be a team...
in every way.

46:25.231 --> 46:26.700
That's nice.

46:28.601 --> 46:30.804
Can you teach me
about what you do?

46:33.505 --> 46:35.375
[chuckles] Yeah...

46:37.242 --> 46:38.677
I'd like that.

46:40.813 --> 46:44.414
What if I posed as, like,
a sexy art student?

46:44.416 --> 46:47.684
I could paint a naked portrait
or I could even paint my body.

46:47.686 --> 46:48.885
I love that.

46:48.887 --> 46:50.854
I just need to get
to an art store.

46:50.856 --> 46:52.389
Yeah, I-I'll get you
the supplies.

46:52.391 --> 46:54.224
I'll get whatever you need.

46:54.226 --> 46:57.161
Well, I'm pretty picky
about my supplies.

46:57.163 --> 46:59.762
Maybe I could go with you.

46:59.764 --> 47:01.801
We could go out,
like a real couple.

47:04.737 --> 47:08.474
I, I-I don't think
that's a very romantic date.

47:09.574 --> 47:13.177
Um, just give me a list...

47:13.179 --> 47:15.182
we'll get everything you need.

47:16.481 --> 47:17.617
Sure.

47:29.728 --> 47:32.463
[door lock beeps]

47:32.465 --> 47:33.733
[sighs]

47:43.409 --> 47:45.441
- Hi.
- There you are.

47:45.443 --> 47:47.545
We're not streaming
for a few hours, right?

47:47.547 --> 47:49.780
- We're not?
- You wanna do something?

47:49.782 --> 47:51.815
Can you go to the art-supply
store and get me a few things?

47:51.817 --> 47:55.385
- I'll text you the list.
- Okay. Uh, what's it for?

47:55.387 --> 47:56.789
It's for the performance
tonight.

48:02.894 --> 48:04.297
Good news.

48:05.331 --> 48:07.898
Nicole will get your supplies.

48:07.900 --> 48:11.334
Oh. Great. Uh...

48:11.336 --> 48:13.903
Well, I need her to pay really
close attention to the list.

48:13.905 --> 48:15.738
The paints on there
are really specific.

48:15.740 --> 48:18.342
- And the linseed oil...
- Well, don't worry, don't worry.

48:18.344 --> 48:19.880
It'll be fine.

48:22.748 --> 48:24.751
I was thinking about
what you said.

48:25.918 --> 48:28.751
You do deserve a treat.

48:28.753 --> 48:30.820
How about I take you out
on a date?

48:30.822 --> 48:33.257
Maybe take you shopping?

48:33.259 --> 48:35.726
- You mean it?
- Yeah.

48:35.728 --> 48:38.365
No more old clothes.
A whole new wardrobe.

48:42.001 --> 48:43.537
Thank you.

48:55.648 --> 48:58.249
Let's make a day out of this,
yeah?

48:58.251 --> 49:00.287
You're the first girl
I trust this much.

49:02.320 --> 49:05.357
Oh. Insurance policy.
Don't worry.

49:23.775 --> 49:25.943
Welcome.
Can I help you with anything?

49:25.945 --> 49:27.981
No, we're just gonna
look around a bit.

49:31.416 --> 49:32.952
Oh. Here we go.

49:34.019 --> 49:36.487
[keyboard keys clacking]

49:36.489 --> 49:38.358
[Hunter] This is nice.

49:41.360 --> 49:42.862
This...

49:44.329 --> 49:45.864
[Hunter] Purple...

49:51.603 --> 49:53.737
- Thanks.
- [Hunter] Mm-hmm.

49:53.739 --> 49:55.507
- Have fun.
- [Grace] Hm.

[dramatic music]

50:04.784 --> 50:07.354
[breathing heavily]

50:22.068 --> 50:25.536
- You're doing okay in there?
- [Hunter] She's fine.

50:25.538 --> 50:27.503
Let me know if you need
another size, okay?

50:27.505 --> 50:30.441
Um, actually, could I get this
in a smaller size, please?

50:30.443 --> 50:31.878
- Sure.
- [Grace] Thanks.

50:34.079 --> 50:35.315
Ah...

50:43.054 --> 50:45.291
You know what? I'll take that.

50:55.835 --> 50:58.836
- [gun cocking]
- Get your things.

50:58.838 --> 51:02.342
If you make a sound, it'll be
the last one you make and hers.

51:27.699 --> 51:30.032
We'll come back later.

51:30.034 --> 51:31.437
[Kim] Okay.

51:32.438 --> 51:34.405
Excuse me.

51:34.407 --> 51:36.572
Uh, stop, please.

51:36.574 --> 51:37.609
Stop!

51:39.644 --> 51:41.715
Hey! Stop!

51:43.181 --> 51:45.148
Get back here!

51:45.150 --> 51:47.050
- That's...
- What do you wanna do, huh?

51:47.052 --> 51:48.421
[Kim mumbles]

51:54.927 --> 51:56.730
Can't fuckin' believe
you'd do that.

52:05.737 --> 52:08.438
- Get out of the car!
- Ah. Ah!

52:08.440 --> 52:11.508
- Come on, bitch!
- [grunting]

52:11.510 --> 52:12.809
Give me the bag.
Give me the bag.

52:12.811 --> 52:14.811
Put on your outfit.
We're going live!

- I'm sorry.
- I told you not to lie to me!

52:24.690 --> 52:26.789
- I told you not to lie to me!
- [Grace] Please, I'm sorry!

52:26.791 --> 52:29.025
- Why would you do that to me?
- Well, I'm sorry! I-I'm...

52:29.027 --> 52:30.994
- Why would you do that to me?
- Sorry! Please, I won't...

52:30.996 --> 52:33.463
You said you'd never
leave me alone!

52:33.465 --> 52:35.599
Take it. Just take all of it.
You...

- I'm so sorry.

I'm, I'm sorry!

52:40.572 --> 52:42.805
I real...
I'm so sorry!

52:42.807 --> 52:44.575
I won't do it again, I promise.

52:44.577 --> 52:46.980
I promise,
I won't do it again, please!

52:48.813 --> 52:50.581
Now you'll pay.

52:50.583 --> 52:54.050
No, no! No, I'm sorry!
Please, don't do this to me!

There's something
you're gonna wanna see.

53:56.114 --> 53:59.081
[Matt] I don't think so.

53:59.083 --> 54:01.918
What did you say happened
to your girlfriend, again?

54:01.920 --> 54:05.021
She got a modeling gig. Why?

54:05.023 --> 54:06.990
I don't think she's modelling.

[Greg] Sorry.

She would never do this.

54:21.974 --> 54:24.074
H-how much do you know
about computers?

54:24.076 --> 54:25.108
- It's my major.
- Well...

Can you track this IP address?

but it's temporary.

No, it's not.

54:54.005 --> 54:56.807
He's a monster, Nicole.
He's a killer. He has pictures.

54:56.809 --> 54:58.275
- [door lock beeps]
- He showed me...

54:58.277 --> 54:59.679
Nicole...

55:00.813 --> 55:02.548
Go to the main house.

55:13.358 --> 55:17.059
Apparently, your boyfriend
saw your performance today.

55:17.061 --> 55:19.565
He claims he's coming after me.

55:21.800 --> 55:23.903
Wipe that grin off your face.

and tell him to back off.

Hi, Matt.

Grace, where are you? Listen,
I'm coming to get you right now.

55:43.222 --> 55:44.820
Just tell me where you are.

No! No, I don't believe you!

55:54.333 --> 55:56.166
Grace, who's doing this to you?

55:56.168 --> 55:58.168
No one.

55:58.170 --> 55:59.702
The videos are tastefully done.

55:59.704 --> 56:01.773
They have launched
my modelling career.

56:03.842 --> 56:06.809
I'm really happy here.

56:06.811 --> 56:08.811
This is what I want
and you just have to accept it.

56:08.813 --> 56:10.746
- I have to go now.
- Grace, don't go. Please.

56:10.748 --> 56:12.048
- Just...
- Goodbye, Matt.

- I love you.

What are you going to do?

56:29.768 --> 56:31.771
Take care of the problem.

another photography studio.

56:45.818 --> 56:48.851
Another dead end. Um, any news?

56:48.853 --> 56:51.420
Yeah, but it's not good.

56:51.422 --> 56:54.825
Tell me. Come on.

56:54.827 --> 56:56.325
She's on a pornography site.

56:56.327 --> 56:59.996
No, not Grace, no. No.
It has to be somebody else.

56:59.998 --> 57:03.766
No, it's not.
I got a call from her.

57:03.768 --> 57:06.103
[Matt] <i>And I think she's being
held against her will.</i>

57:06.105 --> 57:08.237
I mean,
she told me she loved me.

57:08.239 --> 57:10.206
She's never told me
she loves me.

57:10.208 --> 57:12.909
Uh, can you contact
the owner of the site?

57:12.911 --> 57:14.510
I can't. I-I've tried.

57:14.512 --> 57:16.378
<i>We did have a breakthrough,
though.</i>

57:16.380 --> 57:19.081
My roommate was able
to get into her computer.

57:19.083 --> 57:20.816
W-w-what did he find?

57:20.818 --> 57:24.887
Well, apparently,
she went on to some website

57:24.889 --> 57:26.456
called Model Matchup.

57:26.458 --> 57:28.858
<i>She responded to a post</i>

57:28.860 --> 57:31.894
by some photographer
with the handle Beautyclick.

57:31.896 --> 57:33.896
But, I mean, there's no way
to respond to him.

57:33.898 --> 57:35.298
The post's been taken down.

57:35.300 --> 57:37.300
Ah, damn!

57:37.302 --> 57:41.271
Um... Well, I have a meeting
with the detective tonight.

57:41.273 --> 57:45.008
And his shifts goes up
at, at 8:00.

57:45.010 --> 57:46.309
I'm gonna keep seeing
what I can find.

57:46.311 --> 57:47.811
I'll meet you
at the police department

57:47.813 --> 57:49.115
later tonight.

57:50.983 --> 57:52.251
[whispers] Grace.

57:53.518 --> 57:56.219
All right, um...

57:56.221 --> 57:57.854
Let's see if we can find
a similar add

57:57.856 --> 57:59.990
to the one
that Grace responded to.

57:59.992 --> 58:02.291
I mean, maybe this guy is using
a different handle

58:02.293 --> 58:03.559
with the same MO.

58:03.561 --> 58:05.764
- I don't know.
- I'm on it.

Het, Matt, where are you?
I'm-I'm at the police station.

58:41.465 --> 58:44.069
Um, I'm gonna go in.

58:59.318 --> 59:01.383
[Grace] Hunter...

59:01.385 --> 59:04.420
I'm so sorry for what happened.
I promise it won't happen again.

59:04.422 --> 59:07.289
- I know it won't.
- What did you do?

59:07.291 --> 59:10.360
Exactly what I said I would.

59:10.362 --> 59:12.798
Matt won't be available
for calls.

59:15.467 --> 59:17.470
It was the right thing.

59:18.871 --> 59:20.873
He was coming in between us.

59:22.306 --> 59:26.111
Matt was my past,
but you're my future.

59:27.880 --> 59:30.380
This is my home.

59:30.382 --> 59:32.385
<i>And I'm sorry I betrayed you.</i>

59:34.318 --> 59:36.855
Do you expect me to believe that
after what you did?

59:37.889 --> 59:40.490
I'll do whatever it takes.

59:40.492 --> 59:43.059
Do your art project.

59:43.061 --> 59:45.494
We'll start from there.

59:45.496 --> 59:47.132
Full nudity...

59:48.032 --> 59:49.568
like we discussed.

59:57.009 --> 59:58.311
Temptress.

What's the matter with you?

01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:25.101
I saw the pictures, Hunter.

01:00:25.103 --> 01:00:26.369
You snooping through
my computer?

01:00:26.371 --> 01:00:28.338
Yeah. And I didn't sign up
for this.

01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:30.706
- What, are you gonna leave?
- You lied to me.

01:00:30.708 --> 01:00:32.409
You told me
you took those girls home.

01:00:32.411 --> 01:00:36.211
What else was I supposed
to tell you, Nicole?

01:00:36.213 --> 01:00:39.014
- I think I'm done.
- Oh, you think you're done.

01:00:39.016 --> 01:00:40.450
- Yeah. Really?
- I don't think you are.

01:00:40.452 --> 01:00:43.320
Because you're a killer, too.

01:00:43.322 --> 01:00:46.021
So you're not gonna tell anyone,

01:00:46.023 --> 01:00:49.094
because if you do, you're gonna
end up just like them.

01:00:51.228 --> 01:00:53.362
But it, it was
in her search history.

01:00:53.364 --> 01:00:55.565
Well, these online ads come up
and go all the time.

01:00:55.567 --> 01:00:57.133
Okay, they probably
just shut down...

01:00:57.135 --> 01:01:00.973
But she-she responded
to a-a post about a job.

01:01:02.306 --> 01:01:04.441
Can't your computer people
track it down?

01:01:04.443 --> 01:01:07.276
Again, there's no sign
of any foul play here.

01:01:07.278 --> 01:01:09.012
Okay, you told me her boyfriend
got a call from her

01:01:09.014 --> 01:01:10.079
just the other day.

01:01:10.081 --> 01:01:11.548
We think that whoever has her

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:13.383
forced her to make that call.

01:01:13.385 --> 01:01:15.488
You don't know that for a fact,
do you?

01:01:17.621 --> 01:01:20.123
All right, listen, look...

01:01:20.125 --> 01:01:22.525
I got some intel
on your daughter's phone.

01:01:22.527 --> 01:01:24.159
Turns out, it last pinged

01:01:24.161 --> 01:01:26.662
on a tower
near Miami train station.

01:01:26.664 --> 01:01:29.199
- That mean anything to you?
- No.

01:01:29.201 --> 01:01:32.034
My gut tells me
that she's come back into town

01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:35.204
on her own free will and she
just doesn't want to be found.

01:01:35.206 --> 01:01:38.575
When was the last time
that her phone was on?

01:01:38.577 --> 01:01:41.443
It pinged off a tower
about two weeks ago.

01:01:41.445 --> 01:01:43.512
Oh, but she could be using
a, a wireless network,

01:01:43.514 --> 01:01:45.581
so that certainly helps.

01:01:45.583 --> 01:01:47.617
Don't you find that odd?

01:01:47.619 --> 01:01:50.353
What 19-year-old cares enough
about her cell plan

01:01:50.355 --> 01:01:53.224
that she keeps doing it
for two weeks?

01:01:55.693 --> 01:01:59.128
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Matt, I'm so glad you're here.

01:01:59.130 --> 01:02:01.264
Matt, I was just about to tell
Mrs. Somerville here

01:02:01.266 --> 01:02:05.300
that, um, I'm sorry
I wish I could do more.

01:02:05.302 --> 01:02:07.737
But I really can't devote
anymore manpower,

01:02:07.739 --> 01:02:10.472
searching for a girl who's just
posting all over social media

01:02:10.474 --> 01:02:12.508
about how a wonderful life
she's having and...

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:15.811
We're gonna keep looking for her
with or without your help.

01:02:15.813 --> 01:02:17.713
Come on, Matt,
let's get out of here.

01:02:17.715 --> 01:02:20.585
I wish I could do more,
but I just...

01:02:22.554 --> 01:02:25.157

01:03:10.568 --> 01:03:13.538
Thought I'd tell you myself,
we go live in ten minutes.

01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:18.043
This better be good.

01:03:25.516 --> 01:03:26.615
[Hunter] Let's do this.

01:03:26.617 --> 01:03:30.320
Five, four, three,

01:03:30.322 --> 01:03:32.454
two, one.

01:03:32.456 --> 01:03:35.460
[upbeat music]

01:03:52.677 --> 01:03:53.813
Good.

01:03:59.284 --> 01:04:01.253
Your body is the canvas.

01:04:01.887 --> 01:04:03.586
[Hunter] <i>Good.</i>

Okay.

Don't let me down,

[exhales sharply] Yes!

01:05:41.686 --> 01:05:43.454
[chuckles] Okay.

01:05:49.427 --> 01:05:50.496
Okay.

[smoke detector beeping]

01:06:08.380 --> 01:06:09.882

- Help! Help!
- Go back to bed!

01:07:04.768 --> 01:07:07.737
[grunting] Help me!

01:07:07.739 --> 01:07:10.442
I might lose my eye
because of you.

[groaning] Oh, my God!

01:07:14.079 --> 01:07:16.782

Officer?

01:08:08.099 --> 01:08:10.032
- [Hunter] How can I help you?
- Good evening.

01:08:10.034 --> 01:08:12.635
We had a 9-1-1 call
from a woman.

01:08:12.637 --> 01:08:14.737
Just makin' sure
everything's okay.

01:08:14.739 --> 01:08:17.807
We had a little fire in the
guesthouse, some art materials.

01:08:17.809 --> 01:08:21.143
I put it out really quick,
so, uh, she hung up.

01:08:21.145 --> 01:08:23.111
Where's your girlfriend now?

01:08:23.113 --> 01:08:24.580
She's asleep.

01:08:24.582 --> 01:08:26.352
What happened to your eye?

01:08:27.185 --> 01:08:29.652
[chuckles] Can you believe it?

01:08:29.654 --> 01:08:32.621
First time I've ever had a fire
extinguisher and used it before

01:08:32.622 --> 01:08:34.960
and-and it blew back
and hit me in the eye.

01:08:35.993 --> 01:08:37.960
It's got a kick, that thing.

01:08:37.962 --> 01:08:39.495
Mind if I take a look around?

01:08:39.497 --> 01:08:41.563
Yeah. Of course.

01:08:41.564 --> 01:08:43.198
Come on in.

01:08:43.201 --> 01:08:45.100
Be my guest.

01:08:45.103 --> 01:08:48.106
[music continues]

01:08:56.479 --> 01:08:59.714
Evening, ma'am. Everything okay?

01:08:59.716 --> 01:09:01.216
Couldn't be better.

01:09:01.219 --> 01:09:05.554
Well, except that my boyfriend
almost took his eye out.

01:09:05.555 --> 01:09:07.156
- You need medical attention?
- No.

01:09:07.158 --> 01:09:09.558
The patch makes it look worse
than it is.

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:11.693
[Hunter] Sorry you had to come
all this way.

01:09:11.694 --> 01:09:15.063
- No worries. That's my job.
- Let me show you out.

01:09:15.064 --> 01:09:16.465
Hey, uh, you never did say,
was there

01:09:16.466 --> 01:09:18.166
any damage to your guesthouse?

01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:20.068
No, just smoke.

01:09:20.069 --> 01:09:22.170
We're lucky.

01:09:22.171 --> 01:09:24.139
I thought you said
there was a fire.

01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:27.145
[music continues]

01:09:29.712 --> 01:09:31.848
If you don't mind, I'll take
a quick look at the guesthouse

01:09:31.850 --> 01:09:32.881
before I leave?

01:09:32.884 --> 01:09:34.920
Sure. Right this way.

Copy that. On my way.

Hey, it looks like
everything's under control here.

01:10:28.739 --> 01:10:31.607
- I'm gonna respond to that.
- Yeah, sure.

01:10:31.609 --> 01:10:34.710
- I'll walk you out.
- Thank you.

01:10:34.712 --> 01:10:35.911

Oh, look, I found it.
I found this ad.

01:11:12.884 --> 01:11:14.817
It's exactly like the one
that Grace went to.

01:11:14.819 --> 01:11:18.086
It has the train ticket,
the model apartment.

01:11:18.088 --> 01:11:20.289
Look. Can you trace it?

01:11:20.291 --> 01:11:23.125
Probably it's gonna run into
the same problems as before.

01:11:23.127 --> 01:11:24.660
What if we respond to the ad?

01:11:24.662 --> 01:11:26.532
That I can do.

What did, what did he say?
What did he say?

01:12:22.886 --> 01:12:25.791
He's asking if our girl
would come to Miami right away.

01:12:28.993 --> 01:12:32.030
A new girl's coming
from Jacksonville. Go get her.

01:12:35.399 --> 01:12:37.101
Is there a problem?

01:12:38.836 --> 01:12:41.036
Are you having second thoughts?

01:12:41.038 --> 01:12:43.608
'Cause I can fix
those second thoughts.

01:12:49.079 --> 01:12:50.649
What time does her train get in?

01:13:02.894 --> 01:13:05.126

mean she's not there?</i>

01:13:08.065 --> 01:13:10.031
I don't know. I mean,
the, the train station's empty.

Yes, I'm on the way to Grace
right now.

Wait, wait! Where-where are you?
I'm coming.

01:13:46.938 --> 01:13:49.071
No. It's too dangerous.

01:13:49.073 --> 01:13:51.507
Look, I'm gonna bring
Grace back. I promise.

01:13:51.509 --> 01:13:53.742
No, Matt, wait! Wait!

What am I gonna do, Grace?

01:14:23.541 --> 01:14:27.442
What am I gonna do, Grace?
What am I gonna do, Grace?

01:14:27.444 --> 01:14:29.010
Hunter, if you give me another...

01:14:29.012 --> 01:14:32.348
Give you another chance?
I've already given you!

01:14:32.350 --> 01:14:36.152
I've given you so many chances,
but it's-it's over.

I mean,
it's so, it's so obvious.

01:15:06.184 --> 01:15:09.050
I'm gonna film it.
I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm...

I'm gonna film...

killing you.

- [Hunter] Yeah, on camera.
- You can't.

01:15:22.432 --> 01:15:26.367
I'm gonna k...
Yes, oh, I can.

01:15:26.369 --> 01:15:29.073
A-a-and no one's ever done it.

Hunter, if you give me
one more chance...

No, there're no...
Stop talking, stop talking.

01:15:38.448 --> 01:15:41.418
- I'll do whatever you want.
- I just need you to be there!

01:15:43.087 --> 01:15:45.254
Just be there.

01:15:45.256 --> 01:15:47.325

my piece.

01:17:16.314 --> 01:17:19.180
I'm gonna do away with her
online.

01:17:19.182 --> 01:17:21.549
- What?
- It's so simple.

01:17:21.551 --> 01:17:24.585
- It's so simple.
- Hunter, this is crazy.

01:17:24.587 --> 01:17:26.988
It's not crazy.

01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:28.424
I don't know
why I even try to explain it

01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:30.362
to you in the first place.

01:17:34.398 --> 01:17:37.402
[music continues]

01:17:51.148 --> 01:17:54.152
[intense music]

01:18:11.101 --> 01:18:12.701
[door unlocks]

01:18:12.703 --> 01:18:14.439
[footsteps approaching]

01:18:19.510 --> 01:18:22.277
- Matt, are you...
- [Hunter] No, no touching!

01:18:22.279 --> 01:18:24.082
No touching.

01:18:26.082 --> 01:18:28.483
- Matt, are you okay? Matt...
- I told you.

01:18:28.485 --> 01:18:30.020
No touching.

01:18:33.724 --> 01:18:37.095
You should do a private show
for Matt.

01:18:40.463 --> 01:18:43.201
Go put on something pretty
for Matt.

01:18:46.436 --> 01:18:48.102
- Matt! Matt!
- No, don't touch.

01:18:48.104 --> 01:18:49.540
Don't need to touch.

01:18:53.176 --> 01:18:56.280
[Hunter] <i>I have one rule.
One rule.</i>

01:18:57.614 --> 01:18:59.580
What's that?

01:18:59.582 --> 01:19:02.683
Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm...
I was gonna eat it in the car...

01:19:02.685 --> 01:19:04.553
"I'm so sorry, I was gonna eat
in the car. I forgot."

01:19:04.555 --> 01:19:07.125
[Hunter] <i>I have
a deathly nut allergy.</i>

01:19:08.324 --> 01:19:10.327
<i>Sometimes I go nuts.</i>

01:19:11.729 --> 01:19:14.432
[sighs]
Get ready for your kiss, Hunter.

01:19:16.167 --> 01:19:17.635
Morning, boyfriend.

01:19:20.371 --> 01:19:22.507
[Hunter] Clock's ticking, Grace.

01:19:41.324 --> 01:19:44.328
[Hunter groaning]

01:19:46.663 --> 01:19:48.263
[Hunter] <i>I have one rule.</i>

01:19:48.265 --> 01:19:49.430
[echoing] <i>One rule.</i>

01:19:49.432 --> 01:19:51.299
[coughing]

01:19:51.301 --> 01:19:54.304
[Hunter retching]

01:19:55.439 --> 01:19:58.440
[voice cracking]
What did you do?

01:19:58.442 --> 01:19:59.508
- What's happening?
- Don't worry about it.

01:19:59.510 --> 01:20:02.244
[choking]

01:20:02.246 --> 01:20:04.146
- We have to run, sweetheart.
- [Grace] Now.

01:20:04.148 --> 01:20:07.152
[Hunter choking]

01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:13.323
[Hunter choking]

01:20:17.461 --> 01:20:19.164
Help me.

01:20:21.231 --> 01:20:22.865
My Ep-Ep... Epipen!

01:20:22.867 --> 01:20:26.070
[Hunter breathing heavily]

01:20:28.706 --> 01:20:31.708
[shredder whirring]

01:20:33.444 --> 01:20:35.677
[intense music]

01:20:35.679 --> 01:20:37.649
[whimpering] No...

01:20:38.548 --> 01:20:39.650
[grunting]

01:20:43.887 --> 01:20:46.457
[grunting]

01:20:47.757 --> 01:20:50.761
[Nicole groaning]

01:20:55.798 --> 01:20:57.833
- I lost my keys.
- O-okay.

01:20:57.835 --> 01:20:59.800
- I can get Hunter's.
- No, no, we gotta keep running.

01:20:59.802 --> 01:21:02.172
There's nowhere to go,
he'll find us!

01:21:22.225 --> 01:21:23.728
That's a wrap.

01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:26.396
[groans]

01:21:28.832 --> 01:21:31.836
[instrumental music]

01:21:57.595 --> 01:22:00.262
- Honey, you amaze me.
- [chuckles]

01:22:00.264 --> 01:22:01.833
Look how beautiful...

01:22:02.899 --> 01:22:04.366
I'm so proud of you.

01:22:04.368 --> 01:22:06.735
All that you went through...

01:22:06.737 --> 01:22:09.237
that's a lot of courage.

01:22:09.239 --> 01:22:12.840
Thanks, mom.
I'm proud of you, too.

01:22:12.842 --> 01:22:14.643
I can't believe you're finally
following your dreams

01:22:14.645 --> 01:22:16.812
of becoming a lawyer.

01:22:16.814 --> 01:22:18.347
And maybe we can carpool
to classes together.

01:22:18.349 --> 01:22:20.482
- Ooh, can we, please?
- Yeah, okay.

01:22:20.484 --> 01:22:22.353
[chuckling]

01:22:23.253 --> 01:22:24.719
What is so funny?

01:22:24.721 --> 01:22:26.256
Oh, nothing.

01:22:27.024 --> 01:22:28.857
I think I'll take a walk.

01:22:28.859 --> 01:22:30.261
Okay.

01:22:31.929 --> 01:22:33.331
Hm.

01:22:37.033 --> 01:22:39.269
You know, you really look
beautiful.

01:22:41.271 --> 01:22:43.338
Well, it's not exactly
what I pictured

01:22:43.340 --> 01:22:45.443
when I dreamt of being a model,
but...

01:22:47.677 --> 01:22:49.479
No, it's even better.

01:22:53.484 --> 01:22:54.752
I love you.

01:22:55.752 --> 01:22:57.454
I love you, too.

01:23:00.457 --> 01:23:03.461
[song playing]
