00:00.927 --> 00:02.589
<i>Previously on Fringe...</i>

00:02.590 --> 00:05.070
The last will and testament
of William Bell.

00:05.071 --> 00:07.025
"Nina, a memento of me."

00:07.093 --> 00:10.112
I need Belly. I need his help.
I can't do this alone.

00:10.179 --> 00:12.147
I have to protect our world.

00:12.215 --> 00:16.318
Remember how good
we were together.

00:16.385 --> 00:19.154
William is gone.
You can't bring him back.

00:19.221 --> 00:21.106
Wherever Belly is...

00:21.190 --> 00:22.240
He will find us.

00:23.776 --> 00:26.061
The decoder key is in my office.

00:26.112 --> 00:27.446
At the FBI?

00:27.530 --> 00:30.565
No, at Massive Dynamic.

00:30.616 --> 00:32.985
Hello, Peter.

00:33.052 --> 00:35.187
It's nice to see you
again.

00:36.889 --> 00:38.540
I understand your concerns,

00:38.591 --> 00:40.375
but I assure you,

00:40.426 --> 00:42.761
Olivia is perfectly fine.

00:42.845 --> 00:44.796
She is simply resting.

00:44.881 --> 00:48.016
What do you mean,
she's resting?

00:48.084 --> 00:51.053
Well, not exactly of course.

00:51.104 --> 00:54.139
Just in the sense
that her conscious mind,

00:54.223 --> 00:57.526
her awareness,
is at a state of rest.

00:57.593 --> 01:00.612
But I assure you,
she is totally safe.

01:00.697 --> 01:03.982
This is all exactly
as I planned it.

01:06.219 --> 01:08.203
You haven't heard
the best part.

01:08.271 --> 01:09.771
Ask him when he planned it.

01:09.822 --> 01:10.989
Several months ago

01:11.074 --> 01:15.127
when I first met Olivia
in my office on the other side.

01:15.211 --> 01:17.045
I gave her a cup of tea.

01:17.113 --> 01:20.082
The soul magnets
were in that tea.

01:21.517 --> 01:23.785
So these soul magnets

01:23.836 --> 01:27.656
drew your consciousness
into Olivia after you died?

01:27.724 --> 01:30.308
Well,
after my physical body died.

01:30.376 --> 01:33.678
As you can see,
I am quite alive.

01:33.763 --> 01:36.515
Indeed.
Look at this.

01:36.599 --> 01:40.018
Two distinct patterns
of electrical activity.

01:40.103 --> 01:42.738
This one... active.
That's you, Belly.

01:44.741 --> 01:46.141
The other one inert.

01:46.192 --> 01:49.277
Like the brain waves of a long,
dreamless sleep.

01:49.328 --> 01:52.480
Which suggests that Olivia
was aware of none of this.

01:52.532 --> 01:55.167
Now I understand
that this could take some time

01:55.251 --> 01:56.368
for you to get used to.

01:56.452 --> 01:58.036
Imagine how I feel.

01:58.121 --> 02:00.989
I never realized
that a bra was so binding.

02:04.460 --> 02:08.346
Astrid, you can start taking
the electrodes off her... him.

02:08.431 --> 02:10.765
How much time?

02:10.833 --> 02:13.235
You're not suggesting
this is permanent.

02:13.302 --> 02:14.219
Oh, no, no.

02:14.303 --> 02:15.821
We simply need to find

02:15.888 --> 02:18.774
a more suitable home
for me to move to.

02:18.841 --> 02:23.445
Now Olivia's brain can
accommodate my consciousness

02:23.512 --> 02:27.232
for several weeks before
anything would happen to her.

02:27.316 --> 02:28.733
Weeks?

02:28.818 --> 02:30.018
Not a chance.

02:30.069 --> 02:32.454
And I am confident
that Walter will find

02:32.521 --> 02:35.407
a more stable home
long before that.

02:35.491 --> 02:37.358
Same question.

02:37.410 --> 02:38.359
How long?

02:38.411 --> 02:40.745
24 hours.

02:40.830 --> 02:43.748
48 at the most.

02:43.833 --> 02:49.604
Has anyone ever told you, dear,
that you have lovely hands?

02:49.672 --> 02:52.307
Thank you.

02:52.374 --> 02:56.377
You're not seriously considering
sanctioning this, are you?

02:56.429 --> 02:58.113
Well, what would you suggest,
Peter?

02:58.181 --> 03:00.215
If I leave Olivia's brain now

03:00.266 --> 03:03.635
without finding a suitable host,
I would die.

03:03.703 --> 03:07.906
And don't you think that my
life is worth an extended nap?

03:07.990 --> 03:10.391
And besides,
William can help us

03:10.443 --> 03:12.327
understand Walternate's plan,
can't you, William?

03:12.394 --> 03:13.745
Walter.

03:13.830 --> 03:15.563
What he intends
to use the machine for.

03:15.615 --> 03:19.467
- And how to keep Peter out of it.
- Stop.

03:19.535 --> 03:21.419
I want to know
how we get Olivia back.

03:21.487 --> 03:23.238
48 hours

03:23.289 --> 03:26.208
to find
a new and suitable host.

03:26.259 --> 03:27.926
Then I want you
out of my agent.

03:27.994 --> 03:30.345
Or I'll have Dr. Bishop
figure out how to drive you out.

03:30.412 --> 03:31.329
Agreed?

03:31.397 --> 03:33.632
You have my word, young man.

03:33.716 --> 03:39.304
Now I need to retrieve my files
from Massive Dynamic.

03:39.388 --> 03:41.940
There is a box labeled
"Reentry."

03:42.024 --> 03:44.359
- I'll get it myself.
- As fast as possible.

03:44.426 --> 03:47.145
You don't have
to tell me twice.

03:49.000 --> 03:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:08.918 --> 04:12.003
That was fast.

04:12.088 --> 04:16.091
You said I didn't have
much time, Jim.

04:17.593 --> 04:21.396
You didn't.

04:21.463 --> 04:23.798
You don't.

04:29.739 --> 04:32.424
You were right.

04:32.491 --> 04:36.661
It's gonna rain.

04:36.729 --> 04:40.081
There is hope in raindrops.

04:40.149 --> 04:41.082
Isn't that what you said?

04:41.150 --> 04:44.135
What does that even mean?

04:47.840 --> 04:52.260
It means...

04:52.328 --> 04:54.629
That every drop of rain

04:54.680 --> 04:57.349
holds the promise of regrowth.

04:57.433 --> 04:59.935
Each has a purpose.

05:00.002 --> 05:02.270
Even if they don't know it.

05:03.672 --> 05:07.675
I think we can feel that way.

05:09.562 --> 05:10.996
That we don't have a purpose.

05:11.063 --> 05:14.065
But we do.

05:16.736 --> 05:18.353
Jim.

05:27.580 --> 05:31.216
Do you believe
what you're saying?

05:31.300 --> 05:34.302
About purpose?

05:38.707 --> 05:41.426
You said you know how I feel.

05:41.510 --> 05:42.927
You said you know pain.

05:43.012 --> 05:46.314
And you wanted to kill yourself too,
you said that.

05:46.382 --> 05:48.099
Yes.

05:48.184 --> 05:50.385
So?

05:50.436 --> 05:51.886
What's your reason
to stick around?

05:51.937 --> 05:58.360
- My reason?
- Have you found your purpose?

06:02.665 --> 06:04.165
Jim.

06:06.068 --> 06:08.903
It's okay.

06:08.954 --> 06:10.288
You did your best.

06:10.373 --> 06:14.259
I don't believe
in hope anymore.

06:14.343 --> 06:18.579
All I know
is we're all gonna die.

07:32.401 --> 07:36.450

07:51.594 --> 07:53.512
Okay,
here are the reentry files.

07:53.596 --> 07:55.097
You need anything else?

07:55.164 --> 07:56.932
Uh, a computer
with access to social service

07:56.999 --> 08:02.354
and medical databases
would be useful.

08:02.438 --> 08:07.109
Now the host
needs to be biological,

08:07.176 --> 08:09.895
able to cognate, but without
its own governing consciousness.

08:09.979 --> 08:15.117
A human brain would be ideal,
but not a prerequisite.

08:19.138 --> 08:21.957
What?

08:25.578 --> 08:31.083
Peter, your father wouldn't want
to hear me say this,

08:31.167 --> 08:35.303
but even if he does find out
more about this machine,

08:35.371 --> 08:38.173
it doesn't necessarily mean
he'll be able to prevent

08:38.224 --> 08:41.092
the events depicted
in that picture.

08:41.177 --> 08:44.429
I mean, that just could
simply be your fate.

08:46.882 --> 08:50.652
Thankfully,
I don't believe in fate.

08:50.719 --> 08:52.387
Whatever Walternate's plans are
for me, I promise you,

08:52.438 --> 08:54.072
I'm not getting
in that machine.

08:54.157 --> 08:59.628
Well, son,
it isn't always that simple.

08:59.695 --> 09:03.748
I've lived a long time, Peter.

09:03.833 --> 09:06.251
So believe me when I tell you

09:06.319 --> 09:10.572
that sometimes when one walks
away from his fate,

09:10.623 --> 09:13.291
it leads one directly
to fate's doorstep.

09:15.911 --> 09:18.346
Hey, Broyles just sent something
over that you need to see.

09:18.414 --> 09:20.632
Excellent.

09:20.716 --> 09:23.602
<i>Do it again, and I'll show you.</i>

09:23.686 --> 09:24.936
<i>Holy!</i>

09:29.408 --> 09:34.446
This video was taken last night
just after 10:00 in Roxbury.

09:34.530 --> 09:35.914
Nobody could have survived
that impact.

09:35.982 --> 09:39.151
And yet she did.

09:42.421 --> 09:44.039
What are you thinking, Walter?

09:44.106 --> 09:48.743
Maybe it's not the woman
at all.

09:48.794 --> 09:50.095
Maybe it's the location.

09:50.163 --> 09:54.716
Walter, you think that this is
spatial decay, don't you?

09:54.784 --> 09:59.888
Caused from a soft spot
between the universes.

09:59.955 --> 10:02.641
We're beginning to see signs
of degradation on this side.

10:02.725 --> 10:07.462
Well, it was bound to happen.

10:07.513 --> 10:12.800
I'm surprised
that it's taken this long.

10:14.854 --> 10:17.189
All right,
we need a geiger counter.

10:17.273 --> 10:20.158
No, no.
We don't need anything.

10:20.243 --> 10:21.860
We can handle this.

10:21.944 --> 10:23.178
- You need to...
- What?

10:23.246 --> 10:24.179
Go to my room?

10:24.247 --> 10:26.982
Sit on my hands?

10:27.049 --> 10:30.085
The computer is searching
all the local hospitals

10:30.152 --> 10:32.537
for a potential host
based on the parameters

10:32.605 --> 10:34.956
that you retrieved
from Massive Dynamic.

10:35.007 --> 10:40.262
Now I am not someone who can
make that occur any faster.

10:40.329 --> 10:44.716
What I am is the only person
on this universe

10:44.800 --> 10:48.436
who has extensive experience
in inter-dimensional decay.

10:48.504 --> 10:51.439
Fabulous.

10:54.060 --> 10:56.177
Fantastic.

11:08.908 --> 11:12.627
Agent Lee!

11:12.695 --> 11:14.579
You're gonna want to see this.

11:14.664 --> 11:20.285
- Where is she?
- Boston.

11:20.353 --> 11:23.021
We have more advanced ways

11:23.089 --> 11:25.707
to detect molecular degeneration
over there,

11:25.758 --> 11:28.710
but a simple radiation test
should be enough

11:28.761 --> 11:31.045
to see whether the fabric
of the universe

11:31.097 --> 11:32.647
has begun to decay.

11:32.715 --> 11:33.765
And?

11:33.849 --> 11:37.319
Well, everything's
within normal range.

11:37.386 --> 11:38.720
Nothing unusual here.

11:38.771 --> 11:41.273
So if it's not the place,
then it's got to be the girl.

11:41.357 --> 11:43.742
Must be something about her that
allowed her to survive the fall.

11:43.826 --> 11:46.561
Well, then we need to get
to know more about her.

11:46.612 --> 11:47.946
DNA.

11:48.030 --> 11:49.914
Excellent.

11:49.999 --> 11:52.784
I'll take the samples
from the passenger's side.

11:52.868 --> 11:54.035
Look at this.

11:54.086 --> 11:58.123
Me and Belly collecting human tissue
and fluid specimens.

11:58.207 --> 11:59.924
Just like when we were kids.

12:00.009 --> 12:02.210
Glad you guys
are enjoying yourself.

12:05.881 --> 12:07.299
This is Peter
and Dr. Walter bishop,

12:07.383 --> 12:09.083
the civilian consultants
I told you about.

12:09.135 --> 12:11.019
This is special agent
Lincoln Lee from Hartford.

12:11.086 --> 12:13.438
He has some information
regarding this case.

12:13.522 --> 12:15.223
Hi.

12:15.274 --> 12:17.525
Uh...

12:17.593 --> 12:19.611
- This is...
- Agent Olivia Dunham.

12:19.695 --> 12:22.697
- Fringe Division.
- What division?

12:22.765 --> 12:24.282
So what you got?

12:24.367 --> 12:27.369
The woman who jumped
and walked away?

12:27.436 --> 12:29.454
Her name is Dana Gray.

12:29.538 --> 12:31.406
She was murdered
eighteen months ago.

12:34.443 --> 12:35.960
Two bullets in the head.

12:36.045 --> 12:38.046
M.E. said she died instantly.

12:38.113 --> 12:41.549
She was killed with her husband
and her children

12:41.617 --> 12:43.385
- in a home invasion robbery.
- Ooh.

12:43.452 --> 12:45.053
That's grisly.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.639
I can't argue.
This was a tough one.

12:47.723 --> 12:49.891
They ever find who did it?

12:49.958 --> 12:54.346
Yes. We tried to bring him in,
but he drew on us.

12:54.430 --> 12:56.214
Two agents ended up
putting him down in a shootout.

12:56.282 --> 12:57.465
So case closed.

12:57.516 --> 12:59.818
That is, until I get a call

12:59.902 --> 13:01.736
about Mrs. Gray's body
disappearing from the morgue.

13:01.804 --> 13:04.522
- I assumed it was stolen.
- It's a reasonable assumption.

13:04.607 --> 13:06.858
I didn't think anything of it
until I saw this.

13:06.942 --> 13:10.662
Witnesses reported seeing two people
jump out of a dorm window.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.947
Cops get there.
One body.

13:12.998 --> 13:14.616
Grad student who lived there.

13:14.667 --> 13:16.818
But the cops
find two sets of fingerprints

13:16.869 --> 13:18.420
on the ledge
during their investigation.

13:18.487 --> 13:22.424
Second set, those fingerprints
were identified as Dana Gray's.

13:22.491 --> 13:26.211
Which is insane
because she's dead.

13:26.295 --> 13:29.664
Well, you know,
stranger things have happened.

13:29.715 --> 13:33.935
- Um, no, they haven't.
- Don't listen to him.

13:34.002 --> 13:36.137
Her. Sorry. Go on.

13:37.807 --> 13:40.692
Not knowing what to make of it,
I flag Gray in the system.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.560
Over the next two months,
we found prints

13:42.645 --> 13:44.446
at three other double suicides.

13:44.513 --> 13:46.197
Now security photos
show her there,

13:46.265 --> 13:49.617
and eyewitnesses
report seeing her die.

13:49.685 --> 13:52.070
First responders show up,

13:52.154 --> 13:54.239
there's only one body,
and it's never hers.

13:54.323 --> 13:58.543
I know this sounds insane,

13:58.627 --> 14:00.495
but I don't think
this woman can die.

14:02.248 --> 14:05.617
Isn't this our lucky day?

14:24.962 --> 14:26.362
Hello?

14:26.429 --> 14:28.364
Hello.

14:28.431 --> 14:30.316
What's he doing here?

14:30.400 --> 14:32.868
- I invited him.
- Belly invited him.

14:32.936 --> 14:34.320
That's Gene.

14:35.956 --> 14:37.707
Come down here.

14:37.774 --> 14:40.209
I've got something.

14:40.276 --> 14:43.112
Um, what is this place exactly?

14:43.163 --> 14:46.716
This is the place where the mysteries
of the universe get answered.

14:46.783 --> 14:47.783
And congratulations.

14:47.834 --> 14:48.801
Whatever
your security clearance was,

14:48.885 --> 14:50.119
it just got
about seven levels deeper.

14:50.170 --> 14:54.256
Something to show you.

14:54.308 --> 14:55.391
We found two sets of DNA

14:55.458 --> 14:57.677
in the specimens
we took from the scene.

14:57.761 --> 14:59.512
Two different people.

14:59.596 --> 15:02.682
But in performing the tests,
we noticed something odd

15:02.766 --> 15:05.351
in the molecules
of Ms. Gray's body.

15:05.435 --> 15:07.486
They didn't want
to come apart.

15:07.554 --> 15:10.656
They were held together

15:10.724 --> 15:13.492
by an unusually strong
electromagnetic bond.

15:13.577 --> 15:15.477
Um, I'm confused.

15:15.529 --> 15:17.780
You're saying that her body's

15:17.831 --> 15:19.215
being held together
by magnetism?

15:19.282 --> 15:23.536
Well, we're all held together
by magnetism.

15:25.122 --> 15:29.225
Our molecules
are like these hematite rocks.

15:29.292 --> 15:32.661
Magnetism is what keeps us
from flying apart.

15:32.729 --> 15:34.213
It's what keeps us solid.

15:34.297 --> 15:36.215
In Ms. Gray's case,

15:36.299 --> 15:39.218
the attraction
was almost unbreakable.

15:39.302 --> 15:41.887
It's a miracle she left
any blood behind at all.

15:41.972 --> 15:45.340
I think it suits you, dear.

15:47.277 --> 15:49.311
Um, but... But how?

15:49.363 --> 15:55.067
I mean, why did she get
magnetically supercharged?

15:55.152 --> 15:59.038
Belly, what if she took
the energy from her victims?

15:59.106 --> 16:01.290
- Victims?
- The people she's jumping with.

16:01.357 --> 16:03.159
Yeah, that'd make sense.

16:03.210 --> 16:05.878
She absconds with their life force
at the moment of death.

16:05.962 --> 16:07.129
Life force?

16:07.197 --> 16:10.082
You mean like a soul?

16:10.167 --> 16:12.084
Is that even
a scientific concept?

16:12.152 --> 16:16.722
You know,
it's best to try not to be reductive.

16:16.807 --> 16:17.923
I mean, after all,

16:18.008 --> 16:21.277
every living thing
is simply bundled energy.

16:21.344 --> 16:24.797
And perhaps Ms. Gray
has found a way

16:24.865 --> 16:27.767
to capture some vital portion

16:27.851 --> 16:29.485
of another person's
essential energy

16:29.552 --> 16:31.871
and therefore has extended
her own life.

16:31.938 --> 16:34.056
Extending her own life.

16:34.107 --> 16:37.059
A soul vampire.

16:37.110 --> 16:38.494
As it were.

16:38.561 --> 16:41.597
It says in the file
that each one of the victims

16:41.665 --> 16:43.449
tried to commit suicide
previously.

16:43.533 --> 16:45.734
Perhaps simple compassion,
Belly.

16:45.786 --> 16:47.303
Yes, that's brilliant.

16:47.370 --> 16:49.404
She only wants to take
the souls of those people

16:49.456 --> 16:52.458
that are already prepared
to surrender their own.

16:52.542 --> 16:55.444
A compassionate soul vampire.

16:55.512 --> 16:58.264
- Yes.
- Oh, boy.

16:58.348 --> 17:00.966
Um, who are you guys?

17:01.051 --> 17:02.768
Why don't I explain that
to you as we go?

17:02.853 --> 17:04.586
Are we going somewhere?

17:04.637 --> 17:05.753
If you were looking for victims

17:05.806 --> 17:07.356
who had previously tried
to commit suicide,

17:07.423 --> 17:08.641
where would you go?

17:08.724 --> 17:12.426
Suicide hotlines, therapy groups?

17:12.479 --> 17:13.445
Exactly.

17:13.530 --> 17:15.481
Walter, give me a call
if you can figure out any more

17:15.565 --> 17:17.715
about why Dana Gray can't die.

17:57.357 --> 17:59.842
Helpline.
This is Joan.

17:59.910 --> 18:02.378
<i>Hello?</i>

18:02.445 --> 18:04.997
I think I'm gonna hurt myself.

18:05.065 --> 18:07.449
<i>Okay, sweetie,
what's your name?</i>

18:07.501 --> 18:12.338
- I'm Brian.
- Hi, Brian.

18:12.422 --> 18:15.090
I guess you're in a bad place
right now, huh?

18:17.410 --> 18:19.378
I'm tired.

18:19.462 --> 18:22.064
<i>I know, sweetie.
Life can be tiring.</i>

18:23.433 --> 18:24.600
I know.

18:24.667 --> 18:26.852
Listen, Brian,

18:26.937 --> 18:28.187
I really want to help you,

18:28.271 --> 18:31.724
but you have
to let me do that, okay?

18:31.808 --> 18:34.944
And this is too important
to do over the phone.

18:35.011 --> 18:36.946
You're just trying to trick me.

18:37.013 --> 18:39.514
You're gonna send the police
to stop me.

18:39.566 --> 18:41.567
No, listen to me, Brian.

18:41.651 --> 18:43.986
I would never do that.
I promise, okay?

18:44.037 --> 18:45.955
Now, sweetheart,
just tell me where you are.

18:48.825 --> 18:50.409
That's her.
Yeah, that's Joan.

18:50.493 --> 18:52.411
Is she working today?

18:52.495 --> 18:55.530
No, she hasn't been in
for a few days.

18:55.582 --> 18:56.849
Is she in some kind of trouble?

18:58.969 --> 19:00.702
Was she close
with anybody in the office?

19:00.754 --> 19:02.004
Well, she was friendly,

19:02.055 --> 19:03.923
but I wouldn't say
she was close to anyone.

19:04.007 --> 19:06.058
She did her job and went home.

19:06.142 --> 19:09.862
Here's her desk.

19:09.930 --> 19:11.897
I hope nothing's
happened to her.

19:11.982 --> 19:13.499
She's one
of our best counselors.

19:13.567 --> 19:14.733
How so?

19:14.818 --> 19:17.886
Well, if there was
a particularly challenging call,

19:17.938 --> 19:20.272
a person who was at risk,
we'd forward it to her.

19:20.357 --> 19:21.740
She was amazing.

19:21.825 --> 19:25.160
In three months,
she saved at least 37 lives.

19:25.228 --> 19:28.697
She had an uncanny way
of connecting with people

19:28.748 --> 19:29.999
feeling hopelessness.

19:30.066 --> 19:32.534
I mean, anybody who gets struck
by lightning twice

19:32.602 --> 19:35.287
and survived has to have
a perspective on hope, right?

19:38.291 --> 19:40.075
Do you have her address?

19:40.126 --> 19:42.261
Yeah.
Let me go get it.

19:42.345 --> 19:45.130
If Dana Gray is stealing
people's souls as they die...

19:45.215 --> 19:48.884
Then why is she so committed
to saving their lives?

19:51.855 --> 19:53.555
Brian?

20:00.814 --> 20:03.365
Hello, Brian.

20:10.740 --> 20:14.960
You're not scared.

20:15.045 --> 20:18.330
I know when people are scared.

20:18.398 --> 20:22.084
And you're not.

20:22.135 --> 20:23.969
Why?

20:24.054 --> 20:26.922
Why are you doing this?

20:33.113 --> 20:35.564
You think you convinced me
to allow you to come here.

20:35.631 --> 20:41.070
But it was me
who wanted you to come.

20:41.137 --> 20:42.905
Okay.

20:46.142 --> 20:49.161
I don't want to hurt people.

20:49.229 --> 20:50.863
But I always do.

20:50.947 --> 20:55.167
Who do you hurt?

20:55.235 --> 20:58.470
I have no hope.

20:58.538 --> 21:03.759
Like those raindrops that you
mentioned on the phone.

21:03.826 --> 21:08.964
You said they have a purpose.

21:09.015 --> 21:11.300
Well, I don't like my purpose.

21:15.838 --> 21:18.724
Do you think the raindrops will
help those people on the train?

21:18.808 --> 21:20.809
What people on the train?

21:20.877 --> 21:23.328
I don't want to hurt them.

21:23.396 --> 21:25.397
But I will.

21:31.854 --> 21:34.623
And that's why you're here.

21:34.690 --> 21:36.125
You have to save them.

21:38.828 --> 21:41.630
There's a duffel bag
with my bomb.

21:41.697 --> 21:44.717
And that's why you're here.

21:44.801 --> 21:48.887
East Bay Railway train 67.

21:48.972 --> 21:51.873
Car 2. Seat 17.

21:58.815 --> 22:00.933
Like Azrael,

22:01.017 --> 22:03.652
let his angels carry
my damned soul to heaven.

22:09.826 --> 22:13.495
<i>911.
What is your emergency?</i>

22:13.563 --> 22:15.497
<i>Hello?</i>

22:30.131 --> 22:31.931
No. Nothing.

22:31.999 --> 22:33.466
None of them
fit the parameters.

22:34.918 --> 22:37.687
Here either.

22:37.755 --> 22:40.423
We're looking
for such specific conditions

22:40.474 --> 22:42.258
to accommodate your transfer,
William.

22:42.309 --> 22:47.947
A brain-dead patient like this
could be one in a million.

22:53.821 --> 22:54.771
Huh.

22:54.822 --> 22:59.492
William.

22:59.560 --> 23:00.493
No.

23:00.561 --> 23:04.214
No.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.283
There's not much in here.

23:07.334 --> 23:09.669
No friends, no acquaintances.

23:09.754 --> 23:11.454
No one that can tell us
where to find her.

23:14.124 --> 23:17.227
- You?
- Mm-mm.

23:17.294 --> 23:20.797
Just a bunch of books
and a receipt from a flower shop

23:20.848 --> 23:23.016
for a dozen roses,
but she paid in cash.

23:23.100 --> 23:25.685
Hmm.

23:32.610 --> 23:35.144
One of these things
is not like the others.

23:35.196 --> 23:37.414
What's that?

23:37.481 --> 23:38.865
You never watched
<i>Sesame Street</i> ?

23:40.317 --> 23:42.318
<i>The Afterlife of the Soul</i>.

23:42.369 --> 23:45.672
- These other books are clinical.
- But this one's religious.

23:45.756 --> 23:46.823
Exactly.

23:53.647 --> 23:56.349
All the highlighted passages are
about what happens to us after we die.

23:56.434 --> 23:57.467
What's she doing,

23:57.518 --> 24:00.220
trying to convince people
to jump

24:00.304 --> 24:02.355
by telling them how great
heaven would be?

24:07.645 --> 24:09.562
What if we're thinking
about this backwards?

24:09.647 --> 24:13.032
What if that book's not for
other people? It's for her.

24:13.117 --> 24:14.818
Maybe she's the one
that wants to die.

24:16.487 --> 24:20.123
Even if we were able
to transfer your consciousness

24:20.190 --> 24:22.459
safely inside Gene, there are
other matters to consider.

24:22.526 --> 24:25.128
Well, we would communicate
through my brainwaves.

24:25.195 --> 24:27.664
You would hook me up
to an E.E.G. machine

24:27.715 --> 24:28.882
and decipher my thoughts.

24:28.966 --> 24:31.301
That may work,

24:31.368 --> 24:36.222
but still...
I'd have to milk you.

24:36.307 --> 24:39.425
Well, we could assign Astrid.

24:41.712 --> 24:42.729
Walter? Walter?

24:42.813 --> 24:46.883
Oh, not now, son.
We're on to something.

24:46.934 --> 24:50.052
Look, if Dana Gray
was hit by lightning twice,

24:50.104 --> 24:51.137
do you think
that would help to explain

24:51.205 --> 24:52.572
why she's
so overly electromagnetic?

24:52.656 --> 24:54.941
I suppose that's possible.

24:55.009 --> 24:57.327
The ions due to the multiple
lightning strikes

24:57.394 --> 25:00.079
could cause her molecules
to be supercharged.

25:00.164 --> 25:03.283
And possibly intensify
the electromagnetism.

25:03.367 --> 25:04.584
Why do you ask?

25:04.668 --> 25:06.452
We don't think that
she's trying to live forever.

25:06.537 --> 25:07.871
We think she's trying to die.

25:09.740 --> 25:11.040
Dana Gray's description

25:11.091 --> 25:13.760
just went out over the
police bulletin in Dorchester.

25:13.844 --> 25:16.513
Somebody spotted her.

25:20.467 --> 25:22.268
You're sure this is the woman
you saw leaving the apartment?

25:22.353 --> 25:24.554
Like I already told the police,

25:24.605 --> 25:26.523
I was making dinner
when I heard the gunshot.

25:26.590 --> 25:28.608
I came out into the hall,
and I saw that woman leaving.

25:28.692 --> 25:29.859
Did she kill him?

25:29.927 --> 25:31.377
This is
an ongoing investigation.

25:31.445 --> 25:32.395
I'm afraid I can't comment.

25:32.446 --> 25:33.763
Oh, I see.

25:33.814 --> 25:36.316
You're the only one
who gets to ask questions?

25:36.400 --> 25:39.435
Thank you for your cooperation.

25:39.486 --> 25:41.905
So M.E. says that the angle
and wound powder burns

25:41.956 --> 25:43.156
are consistent with suicide,

25:43.240 --> 25:44.290
but the gun
only discharged once.

25:44.375 --> 25:46.793
It only takes one bullet
to blow your brains out.

25:46.877 --> 25:48.461
Yeah, sure, but up until now,

25:48.546 --> 25:50.163
her M.O. has been
to try and kill herself

25:50.247 --> 25:52.165
either with or directly
after the suicide victim.

25:52.249 --> 25:53.416
Why?

25:53.467 --> 25:54.884
If she can't die

25:54.952 --> 25:57.136
and her soul, energy,
whatever you want to call it

25:57.221 --> 25:59.422
is bound to her body,

25:59.473 --> 26:01.958
maybe she's trying
to go with theirs.

26:02.009 --> 26:05.061
Like a hitchhiker.

26:05.128 --> 26:08.014
- A stowaway to heaven?
- Yeah.

26:08.098 --> 26:09.515
Yeah, but she was here.

26:09.600 --> 26:11.234
And Dana Gray, why didn't
she just pick up the gun

26:11.301 --> 26:12.268
and try to shoot herself?

26:12.319 --> 26:17.440
- Try to catch a ride?
- What changed?

26:21.061 --> 26:25.498
I think this is the story
you were looking for.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.734
I'm surprised
you've heard of it.

26:27.801 --> 26:30.848
I'm taking a night class,
and we're doing an essay

26:30.872 --> 26:34.156
on the journey of the soul
to the afterlife.

26:34.208 --> 26:38.378
Then you'll find this
very interesting.

26:38.462 --> 26:39.879
The ascension of Azrael.

26:39.964 --> 26:44.517
It's about a sinner
named Azrael

26:44.602 --> 26:46.886
whose soul was condemned
to purgatory.

26:46.971 --> 26:49.973
After years
of watching him suffer,

26:50.024 --> 26:52.859
the angels asked God
to let Azrael free.

26:52.943 --> 26:54.027
But God ignored them.

26:54.111 --> 26:56.846
So the angels went down
into purgatory

26:56.897 --> 26:58.347
and lifted Azrael up to heaven.

26:58.399 --> 27:01.868
When God asked
why they did this,

27:01.952 --> 27:05.187
the angels said
Azrael had suffered enough.

27:05.239 --> 27:08.157
And the combined innocence
of the angels' souls

27:08.208 --> 27:11.127
outweighed Azrael's sins.

27:11.194 --> 27:13.079
Finally, God agreed.

27:13.147 --> 27:16.916
And Azrael's soul
was welcomed into heaven.

27:17.001 --> 27:20.369
Good luck with your assignment.

28:10.270 --> 28:13.756
Hello, freak show.

28:13.807 --> 28:15.925
It's some kind of shrine.

28:15.976 --> 28:19.145
More like a trophy room.

28:19.229 --> 28:21.314
So clearly this guy was nuts.

28:21.398 --> 28:24.150
I believe the clinical term
is sociopath.

28:24.234 --> 28:27.787
But yeah.
He was.

28:27.855 --> 28:30.323
So why was Dana Gray here?

28:30.407 --> 28:31.657
Agent Broyles?

28:31.742 --> 28:35.311
We found this invoice
in the bathroom.

28:35.379 --> 28:38.381
Twenty pounds
of plastic explosives.

28:38.448 --> 28:40.833
This guy was making a bomb.

28:42.002 --> 28:43.386
So where is it?

29:22.259 --> 29:24.293
Okay.
I'll pick them up on the way.

29:24.344 --> 29:28.181
Yeah, I said okay.

29:28.265 --> 29:30.099
All right.
See you soon.

29:30.167 --> 29:32.301
My sister.

29:32.352 --> 29:34.003
She had another baby.

29:34.054 --> 29:37.106
Her and her husband,
they're like rabbits.

29:37.174 --> 29:42.395
I'm heading to Providence
to see 'em.

29:42.479 --> 29:49.235
What about you?
Where are you headed?

29:49.319 --> 29:54.624
I'm on my way
to see family too.

30:00.181 --> 30:01.798
Alert BPD and put
the bomb squad on standby.

30:01.850 --> 30:04.985
- Let me know when it's done.
- Hey, Broyles, timers.

30:05.069 --> 30:06.136
And the wires are stripped.

30:06.187 --> 30:08.972
Looks like he was getting ready
to attach it to a power source.

30:09.023 --> 30:11.141
He's rigged the bomb
with a time detonator.

30:11.192 --> 30:13.026
We went over every
inch of this place.

30:13.111 --> 30:14.411
It's not here.

30:14.478 --> 30:18.648
Check his credit cards,
A.T.M. withdrawals, Metro cards.

30:18.700 --> 30:20.033
I want a list
of possible targets,

30:20.118 --> 30:22.085
- any places guy'd want to blow up.
- Yes, Sir.

30:22.153 --> 30:24.171
What if you're tracking
the wrong person?

30:24.255 --> 30:27.457
- Dana Gray was here.
- You think she took the bomb?

30:27.509 --> 30:28.825
Why would she do that?

30:28.877 --> 30:32.045
No.
She didn't take it.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.965
I think
I know what's going on here.

30:35.033 --> 30:38.101
It sounds insane,
but here's my theory.

30:38.169 --> 30:39.169
She can't die.

30:39.220 --> 30:40.304
But she wants to.

30:40.355 --> 30:41.939
And she's been trying anything

30:42.006 --> 30:43.974
and everything she can
to move on.

30:44.025 --> 30:45.726
Right?
She's been trying to stow away

30:45.810 --> 30:47.161
on the souls
of the recently dead.

30:47.228 --> 30:49.847
Which is why she's been using
suicide victims.

30:49.914 --> 30:52.182
And how is that related
to the plastic explosives

30:52.233 --> 30:53.951
about to be detonated
somewhere in the city?

30:54.018 --> 30:56.153
'Cause her plan isn't working.

30:56.204 --> 30:57.454
She's looking for another way.

30:57.521 --> 31:00.407
See, Dana was here
when this guy committed suicide.

31:00.491 --> 31:02.859
I think that he told her
where the bomb is,

31:02.911 --> 31:05.712
and the only reason she didn't
pick up that gun and follow suit

31:05.797 --> 31:07.548
is because she's gonna try
something new.

31:07.632 --> 31:10.717
So you think she's trying
to increase her chances

31:10.802 --> 31:13.887
of making it to the afterlife by
killing herself with a group of people?

31:13.972 --> 31:16.539
It would explain
why she's not here.

31:16.591 --> 31:19.476
This woman lost
her entire family.

31:19.543 --> 31:20.761
She's desperate.

31:20.828 --> 31:23.680
Even if you're right,
that still leaves the same problem.

31:23.731 --> 31:24.731
How do we find the bomb?

31:27.435 --> 31:31.721
Hey, is this
the suicide's phone?

31:34.859 --> 31:37.027
Placed a phone call half an hour
before he shot himself.

31:37.095 --> 31:38.028
Boston area code.

31:38.079 --> 31:40.280
How much you want to bet
that's Dana Gray's phone number?

32:11.879 --> 32:13.614
<i>You've reached
the crisis helpline.</i>

32:13.698 --> 32:14.898
<i>This is Joan.</i>

32:14.949 --> 32:16.483
<i>If this is an emergency,
hang up and di...</i>

32:16.567 --> 32:17.534
She's not answering.

32:17.601 --> 32:19.936
Can't run a trace
unless the line's open.

32:19.988 --> 32:21.771
She has to pick up.

32:21.823 --> 32:23.773
Can you change
the outgoing caller I.D.

32:23.825 --> 32:25.325
- On this phone from here?
- Yeah, sure.

32:25.410 --> 32:26.710
What are you thinking?

32:26.777 --> 32:28.545
She may not answer this number,

32:28.612 --> 32:29.730
but I know whose number
she will answer.

32:46.314 --> 32:48.849
- Hello?
- Dana, please don't hang up.

32:48.933 --> 32:50.017
Who is this?

32:50.101 --> 32:51.968
My name is Peter Bishop.

32:52.020 --> 32:55.939
The number
that you're calling from,

32:55.990 --> 32:57.190
how did you get it?

32:57.275 --> 33:00.143
I work with the FBI, Dana.

33:00.194 --> 33:01.178
Well, then I'm sorry,
Mr. Bishop,

33:01.245 --> 33:02.946
but we have nothing
to talk about.

33:02.997 --> 33:05.815
Dana, please,
I know what happened to you.

33:05.867 --> 33:07.650
I know about your family.
I know how they died.

33:07.702 --> 33:08.985
And I know
that you're only doing this

33:09.037 --> 33:12.589
because you want
to be reunited with them.

33:12.656 --> 33:15.092
Just because you've read
some files about me,

33:15.159 --> 33:17.594
<i>Mr. Bishop, doesn't mean you know
the hell that I've been stuck in</i>

33:17.661 --> 33:20.130
or what I have to do
to make it stop.

33:20.181 --> 33:21.831
But I can help you
to make it stop.

33:21.883 --> 33:22.883
The people that I work with
are scientists.

33:22.967 --> 33:24.334
They are the best
at what they do.

33:24.385 --> 33:25.802
<i>And if you come in,</i>

33:25.853 --> 33:27.170
<i>I promise you
they can help you.</i>

33:32.810 --> 33:35.345
Can you promise me you'll
reunite me with my family?

33:37.382 --> 33:40.367
Can you promise me that killing
a bunch of people will?

33:44.021 --> 33:47.874
It's the best chance I've got.

33:47.959 --> 33:51.661
- I'm sorry. I have no choice.
- Dana, that's not true.

33:51.713 --> 33:53.714
You have a choice.
We all have a choice.

33:53.798 --> 33:55.082
<i>Not me.</i>

33:56.517 --> 34:01.505
I should have died that night
with my family.

34:01.556 --> 34:04.307
But for some reason,

34:04.375 --> 34:07.744
some impossible cosmic joke,

34:07.812 --> 34:10.313
I'm stuck here.

34:10.380 --> 34:13.683
<i>- I didn't ask for this.</i>
- As strange as this sounds,

34:13.735 --> 34:15.435
I know exactly
what you're going through.

34:15.520 --> 34:18.304
But believe me, Dana,
this is not the solution.

34:26.246 --> 34:31.585
I guess
we'll find out soon enough.

34:32.703 --> 34:34.737
Did you get it?

34:52.884 --> 34:55.368
<i>I should have died
that night with my family.</i>

34:55.420 --> 34:56.753
There.
That in the background.

34:56.838 --> 34:59.506
Can you isolate that?

35:02.594 --> 35:05.095
<i>Next stop, Norwood station.</i>

35:05.180 --> 35:07.898
Here it is.
I've got it open.

35:07.982 --> 35:09.433
There are
three different trains

35:09.517 --> 35:10.884
from three different points
of origin

35:10.935 --> 35:12.569
that stop in Norwood
at this time of night.

35:12.654 --> 35:14.071
You sure?

35:14.155 --> 35:17.107
Yeah, the 6:15, the 6:25,
and the 6:45.

35:17.192 --> 35:19.193
She could be
on any one of them.

35:19.244 --> 35:21.728
Ask him when they spoke to her.

35:21.779 --> 35:23.280
What time?

35:23.364 --> 35:24.581
Hey, when did you speak to her?

35:24.666 --> 35:25.782
<i>What time?</i>

35:25.867 --> 35:27.417
I don't know.
It was ten minutes ago.

35:27.502 --> 35:28.669
Ten minutes ago.

35:28.736 --> 35:31.755
Oh, good.
I love word problems.

35:31.839 --> 35:34.675
Three trains all passing
through Norwood.

35:34.742 --> 35:38.929
Each traveling
at its own constant velocity.

35:39.013 --> 35:41.848
Not accounting
for station stops.

35:41.916 --> 35:43.100
What are they saying
in the background?

35:43.184 --> 35:44.384
I have no idea.

35:44.435 --> 35:45.435
They're doing that thing again

35:45.503 --> 35:46.603
where they don't
finish sentences.

35:46.688 --> 35:48.605
I merely need to insert

35:48.690 --> 35:51.275
the parameters based
on the train schedule.

35:51.359 --> 35:56.429
That is too early.

35:56.481 --> 35:59.116
She's on the 6:25.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.351
She's on the 6:25.

36:16.067 --> 36:17.167
Excuse me.

36:17.252 --> 36:19.386
Can you keep an eye
on my stuff here?

36:19.453 --> 36:21.421
I have to use the bathroom.

36:50.702 --> 36:51.651
FBI.

36:51.703 --> 36:52.869
We need to clear the train.

36:52.954 --> 36:54.288
There may be an explosive
on board.

36:54.339 --> 36:56.757
We think it's due to go off
in about eight minutes.

37:05.433 --> 37:06.833
This is the suspect.

37:06.884 --> 37:10.170
There are over 300 people
on this train.

37:10.221 --> 37:11.605
That girl's in the next car.

37:18.529 --> 37:20.530
She was right there.

37:22.483 --> 37:24.901
Bring the dogs in now.

37:29.741 --> 37:31.208
I need everyone to stay calm.

37:31.292 --> 37:34.494
I need a single file line.
Move toward the nearest exit.

37:34.545 --> 37:35.712
Leave your belongings
where they are.

37:35.797 --> 37:36.797
You can get them later.

38:00.388 --> 38:03.390
I don't understand.

38:25.579 --> 38:28.748
She's gone.

38:52.457 --> 38:53.623
Hey!

38:53.708 --> 38:56.076
I've got something.

38:56.127 --> 38:58.328
Just down here.

39:07.221 --> 39:09.973
She's dead.

39:23.488 --> 39:25.939
So what changed?

39:25.990 --> 39:29.025
After all that time trying,
why is she able to die now?

39:29.110 --> 39:31.278
Welcome to the Fringe Division.

39:31.329 --> 39:34.531
Every answer you get just leads
you to more questions.

39:34.615 --> 39:37.701
That may be.

39:37.785 --> 39:39.786
But it's a lot more exciting
than Hartford.

39:41.422 --> 39:43.423
Feel free to give me a call

39:43.491 --> 39:46.326
if you ever find yourself
needing some help.

39:46.377 --> 39:48.295
Be careful what you wish for.

40:18.459 --> 40:19.993
Hello, Peter.

40:20.044 --> 40:22.379
Walter thought that
it would be a good idea

40:22.463 --> 40:24.815
for me to stay here tonight.

40:32.740 --> 40:36.042
I just made a pot of tea.

40:36.093 --> 40:37.310
Would you like a cup?

40:37.378 --> 40:41.014
Yeah. Why not?

40:41.065 --> 40:46.219
- So I've been thinking about Dana Gray.
- You're not the only one.

40:46.270 --> 40:49.222
Well, I have two thoughts.

40:49.290 --> 40:53.743
My first thought
is that the energy emitted

40:53.828 --> 40:56.479
from that bomb somehow reset

40:56.547 --> 40:59.716
the electromagnetic charge
in her body

40:59.784 --> 41:01.751
and that it was
that unique charge

41:01.836 --> 41:06.323
that enabled her to die
permanently.

41:06.390 --> 41:08.575
Okay. That makes sense.

41:08.626 --> 41:10.277
What was your second thought?

41:10.344 --> 41:15.098
That my first thought is wrong.

41:18.352 --> 41:19.269
And?

41:19.353 --> 41:23.523
What if, Peter,

41:23.591 --> 41:28.778
this isn't about biology or physics?

41:28.863 --> 41:31.715
What if what we witnessed

41:31.782 --> 41:35.402
was the very reason
that Dana Gray couldn't die?

41:35.469 --> 41:37.404
Why?

41:37.455 --> 41:41.441
Because she needed to be here
to save those people's lives.

41:44.278 --> 41:49.883
- You think it was her destiny.
- Well, destiny, fate.

41:49.950 --> 41:51.885
Jung called it synchronicity,

41:51.952 --> 41:57.841
the interconnectedness
of apparently unrelated events.

41:57.925 --> 41:59.726
I mean, don't you think
that it's curious

41:59.793 --> 42:02.762
we meet a woman
who is unable to die

42:02.813 --> 42:05.515
at the exact moment
my consciousness

42:05.600 --> 42:09.019
seemingly returns
from the grave.

42:09.103 --> 42:12.522
Now as a scientist,
I like to believe

42:12.607 --> 42:15.058
that nothing just happens,

42:15.126 --> 42:19.479
that every event
has some meaning.

42:19.547 --> 42:21.898
Some sort of message.

42:21.966 --> 42:27.253
You just have to be able to listen
closely enough to hear it.

42:31.709 --> 42:34.210
See.

42:34.295 --> 42:36.663
It's a church bell.

42:36.714 --> 42:41.051
So tell me,
what's the meaning?

42:43.337 --> 42:45.288
You okay, Bell?

42:45.356 --> 42:47.190
Peter...

42:48.643 --> 42:54.431
Olivia, is that you?

42:54.498 --> 42:55.782
Oh, no.

42:55.849 --> 42:57.400
What the hell just happened
right there?

42:57.485 --> 43:00.853
I think that
I may have been wrong.

43:00.905 --> 43:05.041
This may be a little more
complicated than I first thought.
