00:15.160 --> 00:18.880
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:34.320 --> 00:36.960
What really matters in life?

00:39.840 --> 00:40.680
Correct.

00:42.000 --> 00:42.840
Money.

00:46.320 --> 00:49.080
But how do we get money,
you little fuckers?

00:52.840 --> 00:57.480
By taking it from people.

01:00.840 --> 01:03.200
You can't tell anyone.
I hope you'll reconsider.

01:03.720 --> 01:04.560
Yes.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.280
-What are you drawing?
-Nothing.

01:10.360 --> 01:11.240
Okay.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.400
Do you want to show me?

01:16.040 --> 01:17.000
For you.

01:20.800 --> 01:22.480
-And who is this?
-You.

01:23.040 --> 01:24.000
-That's me?
-Yes.

01:24.080 --> 01:26.680
You really are super untalented.

01:26.760 --> 01:29.360
Mom, I don't hear
my biological clock ticking.

01:29.440 --> 01:33.600
<i>Little Maria, stop comparing yourself.</i>
<i>You're well provided for, aren't you?</i>

01:33.680 --> 01:34.920
What am I provided with?

01:35.000 --> 01:39.320
<i>Well, with the perfect man by your side.</i>
<i>Smart, extremely sexy--</i>

01:40.800 --> 01:42.880
<i>Surely</i>,<i> he'll be able to make you a baby…</i>

01:44.120 --> 01:46.200
Maybe I don't want to have a baby made.

01:47.240 --> 01:48.960
Mom, there's more to life.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.960
NEW POST

02:03.040 --> 02:04.960
SHARE

02:07.800 --> 02:09.400
-Stop it.
-What is it?

02:09.480 --> 02:11.280
It's really beautiful. It's new, right?

02:11.360 --> 02:13.000
Yes. A gift.

02:18.080 --> 02:20.360
-She's sitting over there. Look.
-I'll take it over.

02:21.560 --> 02:22.440
It's mine.

02:24.400 --> 02:25.560
Oh my God. You're fast.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.920
Larissa, what are you running around for?

02:30.520 --> 02:31.960
And how did you like it?

02:32.560 --> 02:37.480
It's very nice,
but too loud because of airport.

02:37.560 --> 02:40.800
Well, we have an attic apartment,
in an older building.

02:40.880 --> 02:44.640
No garden, of course,
but a rooftop terrace and a pool.

02:45.720 --> 02:49.040
He has an apartment of a similar size.

02:49.120 --> 02:51.520
No garden, sadly, on the top floor.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.320
But there's a pool.

02:57.280 --> 02:58.760
-Sounds good.
-Yes.

02:59.920 --> 03:02.920
I'm not sure because of old building.
I prefer…

03:05.280 --> 03:06.200
younger.

03:08.560 --> 03:09.760
Modern.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.560
Are you thinking of me all the time,
or why are you smiling?

03:18.640 --> 03:22.360
No. I was wondering
how far you'd crawl up Ann-Kathrin's ass.

03:26.560 --> 03:29.160
Why aren't you coming
to the awards tonight?

03:29.240 --> 03:31.640
I'm away for the weekend with friends.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.720
Do you know what that is? Friends?

03:37.360 --> 03:40.360
That works well.
You can proofread these over the weekend.

03:40.440 --> 03:43.280
An-Ki said someone who isn't coming
to the awards should do it.

03:43.360 --> 03:44.960
Nope. I'll be off soon.

03:45.040 --> 03:47.760
That's why I said
over the weekend. Thanks.

03:50.320 --> 03:51.160
Janina!

03:52.080 --> 03:53.000
Anton.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.560
You can give it a like.

04:00.960 --> 04:04.720
Let them jerk off at the idea
of a villa on the Côte d'Azur.

04:04.800 --> 04:08.520
And there will be
a house on the Côte d'Azur.

04:11.640 --> 04:14.720
But only

04:14.800 --> 04:16.480
for us.

04:18.880 --> 04:23.400
And that's why you pick up
those fucking phones and get--

04:26.600 --> 04:27.440
Shit.

04:29.400 --> 04:31.160
Shit.

04:31.680 --> 04:32.520
Shit!

04:36.160 --> 04:38.280
Mommy, I didn't say that I hate kids.

04:38.360 --> 04:40.680
I spend every day at work with 30 kids.

04:41.400 --> 04:45.160
-Because I'm not ready yet.
<i>-When will you finally be ready?</i>

04:45.240 --> 04:46.360
What are you doing?

04:46.960 --> 04:47.960
Online audition.

04:48.040 --> 04:50.080
<i>-…two years younger than you…</i>
-Yes. Right.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.080
<i>…has two children.</i>

04:51.160 --> 04:52.440
-And?
<i>-…not "Yes. Right."</i>

04:52.520 --> 04:54.040
I'll decline. It's a shitty part.

04:54.120 --> 04:56.920
<i>I'd quite like to enjoy</i>
<i>my grandchildren before…</i>

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Mom?

04:58.080 --> 04:59.400
-Hello!
<i>-Hello?</i>

04:59.480 --> 05:00.640
-Hello!
<i>-Hello?</i>

05:00.720 --> 05:04.600
<i>-Maria, can you hear me? Hello!</i>
-The… reception… is…

05:09.280 --> 05:11.360
Why didn't Nils lend you the whole suit?

05:11.440 --> 05:12.880
His pants didn't fit.

05:14.960 --> 05:17.120
We can't leave a mess,
and we have to leave soon.

05:17.200 --> 05:18.200
Yes, Mom.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.400
Can't we just send a text?

05:25.080 --> 05:26.560
Like any other normal person?

05:27.200 --> 05:28.280
They're our friends.

05:34.520 --> 05:36.480
-Where are your bags?
-At home.

05:37.480 --> 05:39.520
I told you
I was going to get you from work.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.440
Well, you are.

05:40.960 --> 05:42.720
Yes. So we can leave right away.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.480
Well, you should've told me.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.880
Hello?

05:48.480 --> 05:49.320
Hello.

05:54.440 --> 05:55.280
Thank you.

06:56.160 --> 06:57.160
So,

06:57.240 --> 07:00.600
Nils invites us to his house
and doesn't manage to be on time?

07:01.560 --> 07:03.320
It's his dad's house.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.480
I'd like to have a dad like that.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.320
Nope. You wouldn't.

07:09.920 --> 07:10.760
Come on.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.720
I'll show you the sea.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.200
Nils, please slow down.
I feel sick. I'm about to throw up.

07:38.720 --> 07:41.040
You know that means
I'd have to kill you, right?

07:41.560 --> 07:44.120
You know that blood
is harder to get out than vomit.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.400
Are you nervous?

08:05.920 --> 08:07.320
Don't you feel guilty?

08:11.320 --> 08:12.800
Don't you feel guilty?

08:14.240 --> 08:15.680
What's up with you?

08:46.920 --> 08:48.400
Do they have a house key?

08:49.240 --> 08:50.280
No. Why would they?

08:51.200 --> 08:53.400
No idea, but my car is here.

08:54.680 --> 08:56.760
Then they need a car key, not a house key.

08:57.280 --> 09:00.520
I was just wondering
if they were already inside or not.

09:02.120 --> 09:04.440
No. How? They don't have a key.

09:24.560 --> 09:25.680
Not so fast.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.200
-Wait a sec.
-What?

09:31.280 --> 09:32.800
You've got something there.

09:33.440 --> 09:34.440
Just lick it off.

09:46.000 --> 09:46.840
They're coming!

09:56.920 --> 09:59.000
Hey. Have you been at the beach?

09:59.880 --> 10:00.760
Hey.

10:01.320 --> 10:03.000
-Hey.
-Hi, honey.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.080
Hi.

10:04.160 --> 10:05.840
-Hello.
-Hello.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.320
You grew a beard!

10:08.280 --> 10:10.640
-I'll go and get the bags, okay?
-Hey!

10:11.640 --> 10:14.040
-Hello! Sorry.
-Hi.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.680
-Do you need help?
-No. It's okay.

10:19.440 --> 10:20.280
I'll help!

10:41.920 --> 10:45.000
Okay, guys.
I suggest that once we get started,

10:45.080 --> 10:49.040
everyone shares their thoughts
on these last few weeks.

10:49.120 --> 10:51.440
Everyone else listens without commenting.

10:54.000 --> 10:57.520
Then we'll see what we've learned
from the whole experience. Deal?

10:58.760 --> 10:59.720
Don't touch.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.040
Those are my dad's treasures.

11:02.840 --> 11:04.240
-But they're all yours.
-Yes.

11:05.160 --> 11:07.120
I am my dad's treasure.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.360
Can we unpack first?

11:08.440 --> 11:09.280
Perhaps?

11:28.640 --> 11:29.920
This is going to be fun.

11:46.680 --> 11:48.960
-Have you talked to him already?
-No. When?

11:50.760 --> 11:52.160
Let's go unpack.

11:53.080 --> 11:53.960
Hey!

11:58.840 --> 12:00.280
Can we just text after all?

12:00.800 --> 12:03.600
-I think I need to talk to her.
-No, not now.

12:29.640 --> 12:30.480
God.

12:32.520 --> 12:34.040
I just wanted to have a smoke.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.520
Or is there anything else
you want to talk about?

12:44.280 --> 12:45.160
I--

12:45.240 --> 12:46.280
Nothing whatsoever?

12:49.120 --> 12:52.800
Okay. I got your winter coat
from the dry cleaner. It's in the closet.

12:59.480 --> 13:00.320
Thanks.

13:10.560 --> 13:11.520
Can we talk?

13:12.160 --> 13:13.760
Of course. What about?

13:14.680 --> 13:16.160
About these last four weeks.

13:17.040 --> 13:21.160
Yes, please. I haven't slept through
a single night these last four weeks.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.480
Do you know how Nils sleeps?

13:24.840 --> 13:27.600
He lies there and sleeps and does this.

13:32.200 --> 13:33.960
So you slept in the same bed?

13:34.040 --> 13:35.040
No.

13:36.160 --> 13:41.480
But I'm really looking forward to lying
on the couch with you again and cuddling.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.680
I've missed you.

13:45.800 --> 13:46.880
I've missed you too.

13:50.480 --> 13:51.320
Nine…

13:51.840 --> 13:54.200
Hey. Did you buy white wine?

13:57.240 --> 13:58.400
No idea. I don't know.

13:59.480 --> 14:00.400
Okay.

14:00.480 --> 14:01.760
I'll go and find out.

14:10.720 --> 14:11.680
Shit.

14:19.240 --> 14:21.040
-Hey.
-Hey.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.040
How are things at kindergarten?

14:25.680 --> 14:27.760
Pretty good. Another colleague pregnant.

14:27.840 --> 14:29.640
And you? How's asshole Anton?

14:30.320 --> 14:34.040
He'll likely win some shitty award.
No editorial board for me, then.

14:34.120 --> 14:36.800
What? Don't let them walk all over you.

14:37.360 --> 14:39.360
-You've got tons of clicks.
-Yes.

14:40.560 --> 14:43.160
Yeah. Hey, did you buy white wine?

14:43.720 --> 14:44.560
Yep.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.360
-Awesome.
-Want some?

14:49.440 --> 14:52.240
Yeah, for photos.
I need more followers than him.

14:52.320 --> 14:54.200
That won't be too hard, will it?

14:54.920 --> 14:58.320
I stalked his profile.
What's with that cat with no fur?

14:58.400 --> 14:59.760
Yeah, that cat, right?

14:59.840 --> 15:04.440
It's a type of Egyptian hairless cat,
hypoallergenic.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.720
He can give you
a whole lecture about it if you ask him.

15:06.800 --> 15:08.000
No, thanks.

15:11.520 --> 15:13.080
Hey, can we talk, please?

15:13.720 --> 15:15.920
Sure. We can always talk. Is this vegan?

15:17.200 --> 15:18.040
Sorry?

15:18.840 --> 15:20.040
The wine.

15:20.640 --> 15:23.480
Let's see. Sylvaner, 12%.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.880
Well, there's no ground meat in it.

15:27.600 --> 15:28.520
Ground meat?

15:29.920 --> 15:31.920
No, it's probably not vegan. I'm sorry.

15:34.880 --> 15:36.360
Are you all right?

15:39.680 --> 15:40.720
We'll talk later.

15:44.640 --> 15:47.480
No. No problem. What do you have in mind?

15:50.120 --> 15:51.600
Can you move out of the picture?

15:52.560 --> 15:54.520
New buildings? Sure. I've got some listed.

15:54.600 --> 15:56.920
They're a bit over your budget,
Mrs. Bolshakov.

15:57.840 --> 15:58.680
Yes.

15:59.200 --> 16:00.440
1.75.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.600
Great. I'll send that to you now.

16:12.520 --> 16:15.040
All right.
We'll talk soon, Mrs. Bolshakov. Bye.

16:16.720 --> 16:17.960
Are you done?

16:21.040 --> 16:21.880
Thanks.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.040
Hey!

16:31.320 --> 16:32.280
What are you up to?

16:33.880 --> 16:34.760
Ironing.

16:39.000 --> 16:39.840
May I?

16:46.960 --> 16:48.640
-Is Janina still outside?
-Yes.

16:49.800 --> 16:50.800
Taking photos.

16:51.800 --> 16:52.960
That'll take a while.

16:57.880 --> 17:00.760
-We bought champagne?
-I think it's been in there forever.

17:22.720 --> 17:24.560
And? When are you going to tell her?

17:29.840 --> 17:31.240
Have you already told him?

17:31.320 --> 17:33.640
No. She doesn't need to, Ben.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.480
I think it's pretty rude
that you came anyway.

17:38.080 --> 17:39.880
-Ben and I--
-Ben and you. You two?

17:39.960 --> 17:41.920
-We did… Well, we--
-Yes. Well, you…

17:42.520 --> 17:45.920
You agreed to a partner swap.
With the rule "no sex allowed."

17:46.480 --> 17:48.760
Which, in itself, is a really stupid idea.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.360
You probably fucked like bunnies anyway.

17:57.360 --> 17:59.440
And then you come here
to break up with us?

18:07.760 --> 18:09.440
-Nils, let's--
-Shut up, Ben.

18:20.720 --> 18:21.640
Here's a Band-Aid.

18:25.840 --> 18:28.440
I'm looking forward to tonight,
when you tell Janina.

18:57.480 --> 18:59.640
<i>I just read</i>
<i>the first draft of your article.</i>

18:59.720 --> 19:02.680
Reads quite well,
but lacks a bit of oomph.

19:03.320 --> 19:05.920
<i>I'm keen to see</i>
<i>what you deliver after the weekend.</i>

19:06.000 --> 19:08.960
<i>If it's great,</i>
<i>we'll talk about your promotion.</i>

19:09.560 --> 19:13.040
<i>I'm off to the awards now with Anton.</i>
<i>Keep your fingers crossed. Ciao.</i>

20:13.520 --> 20:15.320
Surely this thing has Bluetooth, right?

20:15.400 --> 20:17.960
What's it called? Never mind. Got it.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.280
How about an experiment?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.760
No. Not another one.

21:40.840 --> 21:41.720
Why not?

21:42.720 --> 21:43.720
What could go wrong?

21:45.240 --> 21:48.840
I read that if couples look into
each other<i>'</i>s eyes for four minutes,

21:48.920 --> 21:50.640
it builds real intimacy.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.360
-You read that?
-Yeah, I read that too.

21:53.440 --> 21:54.760
-What? Really?
-Yeah.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.000
In <i>Emma</i> too?

21:56.080 --> 21:58.280
No. In <i>Barbara</i>. Among the recipes.

21:58.800 --> 22:01.200
You can't eat anything
that casts a shadow, right?

22:01.920 --> 22:03.080
And what happened?

22:04.000 --> 22:06.120
With that thing with the couples.

22:06.200 --> 22:09.480
They realized pretty quickly
how they felt about each other.

22:09.560 --> 22:12.400
It must be quite intense,
according to their statements.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.400
And you want to do that too?

22:16.040 --> 22:19.000
You want to look into my eyes
without some stupid comment?

22:19.080 --> 22:20.120
Nope. He can't do that.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.400
I don't see the point either, Nils.

22:22.920 --> 22:26.200
Yes, I understand. It could threaten
your newfound happiness, right, Ben?

22:26.280 --> 22:27.760
What newfound happiness?

22:35.720 --> 22:37.480
Did I miss something?

22:38.160 --> 22:42.120
Good question, guys.
Is it possible Janina missed something?

22:43.560 --> 22:44.840
Can you stop provoking?

22:44.920 --> 22:47.320
Yes, sure. If you can stop with your act.

22:47.840 --> 22:48.840
What act?

22:48.920 --> 22:51.680
The two of us are supporting actors.

22:51.760 --> 22:52.600
Nils!

22:52.680 --> 22:55.040
How long were you planning
to keep this up?

23:07.320 --> 23:09.360
I'm so stupid.

23:10.720 --> 23:11.880
You had sex.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.720
-Yes.
-Nine, we didn't plan for--

23:13.800 --> 23:16.000
No. Of course you didn't plan it.

23:16.080 --> 23:19.240
That's why you were so excited
about this four weeks ago.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.360
Now you think you've found true love?

23:21.440 --> 23:23.640
Hold on.
Nobody here is talking about true love.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.120
What do you mean?

23:27.360 --> 23:28.840
Are you in love with her?

23:32.680 --> 23:33.960
Are you in love with her?

23:36.120 --> 23:37.120
Nine, I--

23:38.760 --> 23:40.520
-Are you crazy? This…
-Am I crazy?

23:40.600 --> 23:43.080
-It stings like hell.
-Are you crazy? We had rules.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.280
We just wanted to talk.

23:44.360 --> 23:47.560
Rules that matter.
And you fucked anyway. And you knew?

23:47.640 --> 23:50.760
Even if I did,
can I choose what you throw in my face?

23:50.840 --> 23:53.520
Mr. Bolshakov. Yes.
No, you're not interrupting.

23:55.720 --> 23:56.560
Yes.

23:57.600 --> 24:00.560
No problem. It's all here.
I'll send it straight away.

24:00.640 --> 24:01.880
-Here.
-Thanks.

24:01.960 --> 24:05.680
Yes. No problem.
You'll receive mail in two minutes. Yes.

24:06.720 --> 24:09.880
No. That's what I'm here for.
Have a nice weekend.

24:10.520 --> 24:12.000
-You have--
-One moment.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.480
There.

24:18.040 --> 24:19.120
Now, let's continue.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.520
You cheated on me.

24:22.720 --> 24:26.280
-We didn't mean to hurt you.
-And you don't feel guilty?

24:26.360 --> 24:29.920
We've been friends since we were little,
and you don't give a shit?

24:30.000 --> 24:31.520
No, I…

24:39.360 --> 24:40.720
I have to go to the bathroom.

24:42.240 --> 24:43.760
Was "shit" the cue?

24:47.840 --> 24:49.680
Well, are you going or am I?

24:52.040 --> 24:52.880
I'm going.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.960
I think you're actually a cute couple.

24:58.040 --> 25:00.840
-You shut up now.
-Just saying.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.080
He's such a sensitive soul. Such a softy.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.120
He's so understanding.

25:09.040 --> 25:10.200
So wholesome.

25:11.680 --> 25:12.680
So genuine.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.320
Oh God.

25:15.400 --> 25:16.640
Such a good-natured guy.

25:17.960 --> 25:21.280
Kind of a… true friend.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.840
Shit. I can't do it.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.320
Nine? Are you okay?

25:27.400 --> 25:28.880
-Yeah.
-I'm coming in, okay?

25:28.960 --> 25:29.840
No.

25:32.280 --> 25:33.200
Nine, I…

25:34.560 --> 25:36.920
I'm sorry.
I didn't want you to find out like this.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.560
This wasn't the plan.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.600
Nils just beat us to it.

25:44.560 --> 25:45.600
Are you okay?

25:53.120 --> 25:54.880
Is that a pregnancy test?

26:02.000 --> 26:04.400
I found it in the trash can.

26:20.360 --> 26:22.360
Why's there a pregnancy test
in the bathroom?

26:25.040 --> 26:26.560
-What?
-Is it yours?

26:26.640 --> 26:27.480
No.

26:28.080 --> 26:29.800
Why did you take a pregnancy test?

26:30.320 --> 26:32.320
-Who says it's mine?
-It's not mine.

26:32.400 --> 26:34.400
-It's not Maria's.
-Maybe it was Nils.

26:34.480 --> 26:35.760
-What?
-Huh?

26:35.840 --> 26:39.840
A positive pregnancy test
can indicate testicular cancer in men.

26:39.920 --> 26:40.760
Oh, come on.

26:44.480 --> 26:47.320
So you slept together too, didn't you?

26:49.520 --> 26:53.080
-Why would you think we--
-I asked if you slept together.

26:53.160 --> 26:54.200
Did you?

26:55.880 --> 26:58.120
Well, you can't call it sleeping exactly.

26:58.880 --> 27:01.240
You're not serious, are you?

27:01.320 --> 27:04.680
You put on a big scene
but don't follow the rules yourself.

27:04.760 --> 27:05.600
Stupid rules.

27:06.120 --> 27:07.720
Yes. Stupid rules.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.560
And the test is positive, yeah?

27:12.960 --> 27:15.000
No idea. I don't know about these things.

27:15.520 --> 27:18.240
That's none of your goddamn business!

27:18.320 --> 27:23.080
Wait. If you're pregnant,
it's at least one other person's business.

27:23.160 --> 27:25.200
No. It's all of our business.

27:25.280 --> 27:27.640
Why? You want to be with Maria anyway, no?

27:27.720 --> 27:30.000
-Stupid test.
-Did I misunderstand or what?

27:30.080 --> 27:31.320
Just show me the result.

27:36.360 --> 27:37.200
What?

27:52.960 --> 27:54.560
When were you going to tell us?

27:55.240 --> 27:56.600
I wanted to wait a bit.

27:56.680 --> 27:59.080
Why? Is there anyone else
who could be the father?

27:59.600 --> 28:01.160
What's that supposed to mean?

28:01.240 --> 28:03.160
That I sleep with every guy or what?

28:03.240 --> 28:04.160
Well, I mean…

28:04.240 --> 28:07.240
You play the victim
and let Nils get you pregnant.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.920
-What the hell is wrong with you?
-But you're leaving her anyway.

28:10.520 --> 28:11.680
What do you care?

28:11.760 --> 28:14.280
Well, he might be the father.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.440
I was with her for two years.
Of course it's my business.

28:17.520 --> 28:19.440
…and throw your weight around.

28:19.520 --> 28:21.240
I'm just saying that…

28:24.400 --> 28:25.520
Hello!

28:26.680 --> 28:28.640
-Goddamn it.
-Are you jerking me around?

28:52.080 --> 28:52.920
Yes.

28:57.080 --> 28:57.920
No.

29:09.160 --> 29:10.480
Do you want a sip?

29:11.320 --> 29:14.760
No. I guess not, for now.

29:41.120 --> 29:41.960
Nine?

29:43.120 --> 29:43.960
What?

29:47.440 --> 29:48.280
Why?

29:51.600 --> 29:52.680
Why what?

31:01.840 --> 31:03.400
Did you want to kill me before?

31:07.640 --> 31:08.480
Yes.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.040
Maybe I did want to kill you.

31:12.560 --> 31:13.920
I don't get it.

31:15.360 --> 31:16.200
Why?

31:17.320 --> 31:18.920
You were done with me anyway.

31:19.720 --> 31:22.120
I wasn't done with you.

31:23.760 --> 31:25.080
But that was your plan.

31:26.680 --> 31:27.600
What was our plan?

31:29.080 --> 31:30.640
Guys, I don't have a plan.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.400
Congratulations.

31:48.360 --> 31:49.520
You're gonna be a dad.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.440
Guys, can't you do the math?

31:53.080 --> 31:54.680
You could both be the father.

32:08.080 --> 32:09.680
-We should talk.
-Yeah.

32:10.240 --> 32:13.320
I think Jonas is a good name for a boy.

32:13.400 --> 32:15.240
You don't give a shit, do you?

32:15.840 --> 32:18.480
Because I'm not freaking out
that I might be a dad?

32:18.560 --> 32:21.200
If I'd known it would end like this,

32:21.280 --> 32:23.640
I would've never told you
about this shit experiment.

32:23.720 --> 32:26.600
Sticking to the rules
may have been enough.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.400
-Wow. You're one to talk.
-Okay. Stop.

32:30.120 --> 32:31.120
We all screwed up.

32:31.720 --> 32:33.120
You’re having a baby.

32:34.280 --> 32:37.280
We all surrendered
to some shitty illusion.

32:37.360 --> 32:38.600
What illusion?

32:39.800 --> 32:41.640
That monogamy works.

32:42.240 --> 32:44.080
Why shouldn't monogamy work?

32:44.600 --> 32:47.600
There are some animals
that are as monogamous as humans.

32:47.680 --> 32:49.680
-Which person is monogamous?
-Yes.

32:49.760 --> 32:50.600
Look around.

32:50.680 --> 32:53.320
Name three mammals
that are monogamous, Nine.

32:53.400 --> 32:54.440
Wolves.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.240
Foxes.

32:56.320 --> 32:58.320
Penguins have long-distance relationships.

32:59.400 --> 33:03.960
-Yes. Some birds and dolphins too.
-Dolphins are gang rapists.

33:04.040 --> 33:07.120
Mammals are driven by instincts
and humans are mammals.

33:07.200 --> 33:08.120
But we have feelings.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.640
You, a vegan, are telling me
that animals don't have feelings.

33:12.720 --> 33:15.480
No. But we have feelings,
and we can reflect them.

33:15.560 --> 33:16.840
We can?

33:16.920 --> 33:19.880
We may not be
perfectly monogamous penguins,

33:19.960 --> 33:23.040
but we are animals
with a strong sex drive.

33:23.120 --> 33:25.520
Or in your case, reproductive urge.

33:26.560 --> 33:30.160
If it's all about sex,
why did you make those stupid rules?

33:30.240 --> 33:31.840
The swap wasn't about sex.

33:31.920 --> 33:34.200
Swapping partners
is always about sex, Maria.

33:35.400 --> 33:39.080
In the office, they said that some couples
got back together through a swap.

33:39.160 --> 33:41.080
Sure. For the first two weeks,

33:41.160 --> 33:43.000
you might enjoy your freedom.

33:43.080 --> 33:47.160
But after that, you realize
what you really want and value.

33:47.240 --> 33:49.240
How many in your editorial team did it?

33:49.320 --> 33:51.400
Nils, I wasn't happy.

34:08.360 --> 34:10.360
Why didn't you just talk to me?

34:10.440 --> 34:12.640
It's not enough if only one person talks.

34:14.000 --> 34:18.400
Look, other couples get together.
They stay together. They have children.

34:18.480 --> 34:19.560
All perfect.

34:19.640 --> 34:21.320
But they don't have sex anymore.

34:21.400 --> 34:22.320
We do.

34:22.400 --> 34:27.120
That was probably the only thing
we still shared.

34:34.920 --> 34:38.360
But we wanted to find out
what was missing in our relationships.

34:39.240 --> 34:40.480
Why it wasn't great.

34:41.360 --> 34:42.480
And did you find out?

34:43.000 --> 34:43.840
What?

34:44.360 --> 34:45.440
What was missing.

34:49.560 --> 34:50.600
Ben opens up.

34:51.240 --> 34:53.160
He talks about his feelings.

34:53.680 --> 34:56.600
He also talks about his fears. Nils.

34:56.680 --> 34:59.320
That's awesome.
I give you credit for that.

34:59.400 --> 35:00.360
I think it's great.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.360
Why didn't you tell me you missed that?

35:03.440 --> 35:05.480
Because I wasn't aware of it.

35:05.560 --> 35:07.040
And is that my problem?

35:07.120 --> 35:08.480
It's my fault? Because--

35:08.560 --> 35:10.840
-Were you happy?
-Yes, I was happy.

35:11.840 --> 35:13.520
For 1,000 days, I was happy.

35:13.600 --> 35:16.240
I could tell you
the happiest day right now.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.360
The one day you were really happy.

35:18.440 --> 35:20.400
There are days when we're happier--

35:20.480 --> 35:23.360
Why can't we be happy every day?

35:23.440 --> 35:25.600
-Realism.
-Or cynicism.

35:26.120 --> 35:27.880
No. That's not cynicism.

35:27.960 --> 35:31.440
You don't have to be happy every day
to have a happy relationship.

35:37.160 --> 35:38.680
Anyone else want a drink?

35:51.600 --> 35:55.680
Right now, I can't remember
the last time I was really happy.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.640
Yes. That's normal.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.760
We always remember bad times
more acutely than good times.

36:06.480 --> 36:09.440
That's why you hate your ex-partners
so much.

36:10.120 --> 36:11.400
Do you hate me now?

36:13.240 --> 36:14.640
Nine, I didn't say that.

36:14.720 --> 36:16.400
So we're still together.

36:19.280 --> 36:21.240
If we had been that happy,

36:21.320 --> 36:23.640
you wouldn't have suggested this swap.

36:23.720 --> 36:26.400
Ben, I never suggested this swap.

36:26.480 --> 36:29.720
I told Maria about it,
and she wanted to do it.

36:30.240 --> 36:31.120
Snitch.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.800
But that's how it was.

36:33.680 --> 36:35.080
What does it change now?

36:36.480 --> 36:38.240
Then I'd like to do the experiment.

36:39.680 --> 36:40.960
What experiment?

36:41.680 --> 36:43.640
The one we talked about earlier.

36:44.480 --> 36:46.160
-We're listening.
-Looking at each other.

36:48.480 --> 36:51.400
You want to look one of us in the eye
for four minutes?

36:51.480 --> 36:53.960
No, I want to look Ben in the eye
for four minutes.

37:07.240 --> 37:08.320
We need a watch.

37:10.160 --> 37:11.000
Here.

37:16.840 --> 37:17.680
Great.

37:18.600 --> 37:19.680
Well then.

37:21.200 --> 37:25.480
Let's shut up and look the person opposite
in the eye for four minutes

37:25.560 --> 37:26.960
until the timer rings. Okay?

37:31.120 --> 37:32.160
Four minutes.

37:37.320 --> 37:38.400
Here we go.

39:33.360 --> 39:35.000
Oh God! Fuck!

39:36.680 --> 39:37.560
Fuck!

39:38.880 --> 39:39.760
Bucket!

39:39.840 --> 39:41.120
-Get a bucket!
-Fuck.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.200
-I have to take pictures.
-Get a bucket!

39:43.280 --> 39:45.720
No. I have to take pictures.
She needs followers.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.920
She'll have more than the Kardashians.

39:48.440 --> 39:51.400
-I'm feeling sick.
-Ben! The bucket's in the storeroom

39:53.080 --> 39:55.280
Ben! In the kitchen.

39:55.800 --> 39:57.200
A little…

39:58.040 --> 39:59.240
a little duck face. Quick.

40:08.600 --> 40:11.920
This is karma, people. This is karma.

40:14.080 --> 40:15.280
Are you crazy?

40:15.880 --> 40:17.400
Go get a bucket now.

40:23.160 --> 40:24.840
And a rag and the kitchen roll.

40:24.920 --> 40:26.360
In the kitchen, Maria.

40:31.800 --> 40:32.640
Shit.

40:46.280 --> 40:48.360
Man, did you enjoy it as much as me?

41:04.880 --> 41:06.840
-What are you doing?
-I want to go home.

41:10.920 --> 41:12.960
Hold on. Who should drive you? Me or Ben?

41:13.040 --> 41:15.240
With Janina's car or what?

41:17.440 --> 41:19.000
You're enjoying this, right?

41:19.920 --> 41:20.760
A little, yes.

41:20.840 --> 41:22.560
Man, it's just complicated.

41:22.640 --> 41:24.080
Maria, this isn't Facebook.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.960
-Let me through.
-No.

41:28.720 --> 41:30.000
-Let me though.
-No.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.400
-Nils, let me--
-No.

41:38.000 --> 41:38.920
Seriously?

41:41.560 --> 41:42.400
Shit!

41:49.760 --> 41:50.760
No, Maria!

41:54.560 --> 41:56.280
Are you out of your mind?

41:57.840 --> 41:58.760
Don't. Careful.

41:58.840 --> 42:00.680
There's… Careful, your head!

42:00.760 --> 42:03.280
-Let me go!
-Stop!

42:03.360 --> 42:04.640
Are you--

42:07.160 --> 42:08.960
Did you want to kill yourself?

42:10.240 --> 42:11.800
Nine, we're on the first floor.

42:25.880 --> 42:28.160
Really, there's no need for this.

42:41.040 --> 42:41.920
Shit.

42:48.320 --> 42:49.880
Do you know what you're doing?

42:50.440 --> 42:51.280
Sure.

42:51.800 --> 42:53.280
I played a paramedic once.

43:04.560 --> 43:06.320
What would you do if I killed myself?

43:07.640 --> 43:09.880
Would you regret
wanting to break up with me?

43:11.760 --> 43:14.560
Nine, please stop humiliating yourself.

43:47.160 --> 43:48.040
You know what?

43:50.080 --> 43:52.160
I think it's time to say "thank you."

43:57.760 --> 44:00.480
No, it's nice.
Everyone's getting involved here.

44:01.120 --> 44:03.600
Maria makes sure
there's fresh air in the bedroom.

44:03.680 --> 44:05.360
You play the sexy nurse.

44:05.880 --> 44:08.240
Janina's cleaning.
Everyone does what they can.

44:09.840 --> 44:10.960
Isn't it nice?

44:11.920 --> 44:13.240
That's what friendship is.

44:19.880 --> 44:20.720
Yeah.

44:54.960 --> 44:57.480
I always say,
if you want to get all cuddly,

44:58.000 --> 45:02.320
all you need for a first date
is an egg and <i>herbes de Provence</i>.

45:03.080 --> 45:05.560
This is the moment you take it out
and say "Boom,

45:06.080 --> 45:08.280
wild herbs grown in the South of France."

45:08.360 --> 45:10.240
You know exactly how much to use.

45:10.840 --> 45:13.520
That's when she thinks,
"This tastes good."

45:13.600 --> 45:16.640
Toss back and forth.
A small egg, nothing to it.

45:17.320 --> 45:19.880
One, two, three,
and the panties go flying.

45:22.960 --> 45:24.840
Come on, Janina. That's…

46:31.360 --> 46:32.240
Are you awake?

46:43.760 --> 46:45.440
Ben, hey, isn't this crazy?

46:46.400 --> 46:48.080
One of us is going to be a dad.

46:58.960 --> 46:59.800
Nils.

47:05.720 --> 47:07.560
I can't be the baby's father.

47:10.800 --> 47:11.640
Why?

47:12.600 --> 47:13.440
Wait.

47:13.960 --> 47:15.520
You weren't having sex anymore?

47:16.160 --> 47:18.840
On the contrary.

47:20.000 --> 47:20.960
You see…

47:24.200 --> 47:25.600
I can't father any children.

47:28.160 --> 47:29.040
What?

47:31.440 --> 47:33.760
You're the dad
because I can't father children.

47:35.520 --> 47:37.120
Hold on. Are you sure?

47:39.400 --> 47:40.240
Why?

47:41.240 --> 47:42.720
Come on. That doesn't matter.

47:43.400 --> 47:45.520
I can't be the dad.

47:46.040 --> 47:46.920
That's it.

48:03.880 --> 48:05.000
Congratulations.

48:06.880 --> 48:07.920
You're gonna be a dad.

50:07.720 --> 50:09.880
Whoa! Ben, are you crazy or what?

50:09.960 --> 50:10.800
Sorry.

50:12.240 --> 50:13.120
I didn't mean to.

50:17.640 --> 50:18.720
I thought it was Ben.

50:19.440 --> 50:21.240
Is everyone going crazy now?

50:31.440 --> 50:37.120
FRAGILE

51:23.800 --> 51:24.840
Where's Janina?

51:26.080 --> 51:27.040
No idea.

51:28.640 --> 51:30.000
The car is still there.

51:32.080 --> 51:34.080
She didn't tell you where she was going?

51:38.400 --> 51:40.280
She was already gone when I got up.

51:43.640 --> 51:44.760
Her phone's still there.

51:50.080 --> 51:52.560
-What's that?
-Sleeping pills. It's empty.

51:54.920 --> 51:56.440
Did you say anything to her?

51:57.360 --> 51:59.360
What am I supposed to have said?

52:01.720 --> 52:02.600
No.

52:03.640 --> 52:04.640
What's going on?

52:13.200 --> 52:14.080
Shit.

52:41.760 --> 52:43.040
We have to find her.

52:43.760 --> 52:46.040
Ben, don't you think you're overreacting?

52:48.480 --> 52:50.080
You know Janina.

52:50.160 --> 52:52.360
This is just another one
of her little games.

52:52.440 --> 52:53.800
She won't hurt herself.

52:54.960 --> 52:57.120
Janina never goes out without her phone.

53:07.320 --> 53:08.160
Nine!

53:10.640 --> 53:11.520
Nine!

53:13.600 --> 53:14.440
Nine!

53:16.560 --> 53:17.600
Nine!

53:26.760 --> 53:27.880
Nine!

53:28.800 --> 53:30.040
Oh shit!

53:33.680 --> 53:34.800
Janina!

53:40.800 --> 53:41.760
Janina!

53:42.920 --> 53:43.880
Janina!

53:52.320 --> 53:53.680
Janina!

53:56.000 --> 53:56.960
Janina!

54:05.600 --> 54:06.800
What's he doing?

54:06.880 --> 54:07.760
Oh God!

54:09.360 --> 54:10.800
He's been looking for you everywhere.

54:10.880 --> 54:12.000
-For me?
-Yes.

54:17.920 --> 54:20.280
Thank God! Where have you been?

54:20.360 --> 54:21.960
I went jogging.

54:22.480 --> 54:24.600
What? Since when do you go jogging?

54:24.680 --> 54:26.080
What's the matter with you?

54:26.160 --> 54:27.000
I…

54:27.760 --> 54:29.440
Why didn't you take your damn phone?

54:29.520 --> 54:31.000
It was dead.

54:33.200 --> 54:35.120
I thought you might have hurt yourself.

54:35.640 --> 54:37.320
Were you worried about me?

54:38.880 --> 54:40.760
Or about your baby?

54:42.640 --> 54:43.920
It's not his baby.

54:44.600 --> 54:45.800
That's not clear yet.

54:46.320 --> 54:47.160
Or is it?

54:47.760 --> 54:49.280
-Yes, it is.
-No.

54:50.360 --> 54:51.240
Yes.

54:53.600 --> 54:56.680
It's clear because as a kid,
I had a fucking undescended testicle.

55:00.040 --> 55:01.080
What does that mean?

55:03.520 --> 55:04.920
I can't father children.

55:06.800 --> 55:08.520
Nils has to be the father.

55:10.000 --> 55:12.080
Why didn't you tell me?

55:13.600 --> 55:14.440
Why?

55:15.560 --> 55:17.560
So I can be an even bigger loser?

55:17.640 --> 55:19.480
I'm already the failed actor.

55:19.560 --> 55:20.720
-Isn't that enough?
-Ben.

55:21.880 --> 55:22.920
It's true.

55:24.120 --> 55:25.840
-Ben!
-Ben, come on.

55:25.920 --> 55:27.280
Nobody said that you--

55:27.360 --> 55:28.800
Ben, you're not a loser

55:28.880 --> 55:31.880
just because
your testicle does its own thing.

55:32.400 --> 55:35.080
What? Is it only decorative
down there now, like a Picasso?

55:35.600 --> 55:38.040
Gee, a wandering testicle.
That's just nature.

55:38.120 --> 55:39.560
It's ebb and flow.

55:39.640 --> 55:42.600
Hey, your fucking sarcasm
and your fucking comments!

55:42.680 --> 55:44.240
Take it easy.

55:44.760 --> 55:47.280
If you don't shut the fuck up now…

55:48.440 --> 55:49.400
Ben, calm down.

55:50.000 --> 55:53.240
Your fucking comments
are really getting on my nerves.

55:53.320 --> 55:55.200
-Calm down.
-Stop, you!

55:56.240 --> 55:57.440
Ben!

55:58.280 --> 56:01.080
Ben, I have…
Ben, I have trophies in my closet.

56:01.160 --> 56:03.160
For sports! Certificates of honor!

56:07.560 --> 56:08.560
Guys!

56:11.160 --> 56:12.920
Guys! Come on!

56:14.520 --> 56:15.760
Calm down!

56:29.920 --> 56:30.760
Shit.

56:54.800 --> 56:55.840
Congratulations.

57:17.680 --> 57:18.560
Are they gone?

57:23.560 --> 57:24.680
-Yes.
-Good fight.

57:54.720 --> 57:57.280
It's not with… here…

57:57.360 --> 57:58.320
All right.

58:02.360 --> 58:04.200
I'm gonna create a little steam.

58:05.240 --> 58:06.440
A bit of oomph, right?

58:22.600 --> 58:23.440
Nils.

58:24.400 --> 58:28.040
I'm sorry that I came after you like that.

58:28.120 --> 58:29.000
Don't worry.

58:34.760 --> 58:35.800
Ben.

58:36.360 --> 58:38.680
Tell me, just out of interest,

58:38.760 --> 58:40.640
your testicle, is that--

58:41.160 --> 58:42.800
-Nils.
-You and your testicles.

58:42.880 --> 58:45.240
What? I was just asking.

58:45.320 --> 58:47.320
Can we stop talking about my balls here?

58:47.400 --> 58:48.480
Sorry.

58:48.560 --> 58:50.680
In some ways, everyone is a bit bi.

58:50.760 --> 58:51.680
Yeah?

58:51.760 --> 58:55.680
Yeah. According to statistics,
everyone has some homosexual fantasies

58:55.760 --> 58:57.480
about a girlfriend or boyfriend.

58:58.000 --> 58:59.760
According to statistics.

59:00.680 --> 59:02.880
Did you have one about me?

59:06.040 --> 59:09.760
I think, generally speaking,
that you have beautiful breasts.

59:09.840 --> 59:10.920
-That's true.
-True.

59:14.440 --> 59:16.800
Have you had fantasies about each other?

59:16.880 --> 59:18.000
-Yes.
-No.

59:19.280 --> 59:20.120
-What?
-Yes.

59:20.200 --> 59:22.960
-This is getting interesting.
-Of course. Come on. Sure.

59:23.920 --> 59:24.760
No.

59:25.880 --> 59:26.720
Okay.

59:28.640 --> 59:29.680
Well, I…

59:30.200 --> 59:32.240
It might be the weed,

59:32.320 --> 59:36.560
but I'm curious
what you two see in him. I mean…

59:36.640 --> 59:37.840
You smoked weed?

59:38.360 --> 59:40.280
-Yes.
-When was that?

59:40.800 --> 59:41.640
Earlier.

59:42.320 --> 59:44.120
I couldn't cope with being around you.

59:46.280 --> 59:48.680
Well then, sure.

59:49.320 --> 59:50.600
-What?
-What?

59:50.680 --> 59:52.760
You should try everything at least once.

59:54.680 --> 59:55.520
She's right.

59:56.800 --> 59:57.680
Come on, Ben.

59:57.760 --> 1:00:00.400
Loosen up now. Here. Come.

1:00:25.440 --> 1:00:26.520
Not bad.

1:00:27.040 --> 1:00:30.520
Wow, that took me by surprise.
I was totally up on my tiptoes.

1:00:30.600 --> 1:00:31.920
You have such soft lips.

1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:35.360
I thought beards are scratchy,
but it was like getting into a bed.

1:00:35.440 --> 1:00:36.680
It was incredibly soft.

1:00:37.840 --> 1:00:39.560
Yeah. And you are a great kisser.

1:00:47.440 --> 1:00:48.680
I love you all the same.

1:00:53.160 --> 1:00:55.200
Do you think gays are happier?

1:00:56.000 --> 1:00:58.040
We talked about monogamy yesterday.

1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:01.160
Isn't it true

1:01:02.480 --> 1:01:04.600
that most gays are in open relationships?

1:01:04.680 --> 1:01:06.760
I think that's a bit of a cliché.

1:01:09.440 --> 1:01:11.600
I think most gays aren't in relationships.

1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:13.440
What?

1:01:15.000 --> 1:01:18.280
-What?
-You're so blatantly homophobic.

1:01:18.360 --> 1:01:19.480
I'm not homophobic.

1:01:19.560 --> 1:01:22.120
I'm not afraid of gays.
They can do what they like.

1:01:22.200 --> 1:01:23.920
Look at Florian and Christian.

1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:27.520
They've been together happily for years,

1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:31.200
although, or because,
they mostly have sex with others.

1:01:31.280 --> 1:01:35.600
Maybe they've just figured out
how to have sex with someone

1:01:36.120 --> 1:01:38.040
without getting confused emotionally.

1:01:39.520 --> 1:01:43.040
Yes. And we're just not able do that.

1:01:45.760 --> 1:01:48.200
No. We're not able do that.

1:01:53.160 --> 1:01:55.120
What makes a good relationship?

1:01:57.800 --> 1:01:58.640
Well?

1:02:00.120 --> 1:02:02.600
-That was a question.
-Okay.

1:02:04.560 --> 1:02:06.160
-Honesty.
-Honesty.

1:02:10.440 --> 1:02:11.800
Yes, probably.

1:02:18.120 --> 1:02:19.160
A feeling of safety.

1:02:21.880 --> 1:02:23.920
Oh, Janina.

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:25.240
You're right.

1:02:28.720 --> 1:02:30.000
-Yes.
-You kind soul.

1:02:30.080 --> 1:02:31.480
I'm serious.

1:02:32.480 --> 1:02:35.520
That feeling when you come home
and someone's there.

1:02:35.600 --> 1:02:39.920
And you say, "I'm home!"
And they say, "I'm here!"

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.480
Or, "I've made some dinner!"

1:02:43.160 --> 1:02:44.160
Do I want that?

1:02:45.120 --> 1:02:46.880
-Do you want that?
-Yes, maybe I do.

1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:48.840
Wow. I am so hungry.

1:02:51.240 --> 1:02:53.320
None of us said being faithful.

1:02:54.640 --> 1:03:00.320
Maybe because being faithful
should just be a given in a relationship.

1:03:00.400 --> 1:03:01.480
Yes, maybe…

1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:04.000
We saw how much of a given
being faithful is.

1:03:04.080 --> 1:03:06.920
Polygamy is not the same as polyamory.

1:03:07.720 --> 1:03:12.120
You can sleep with somebody else
and still be faithful, somehow.

1:03:12.200 --> 1:03:13.080
Yes? How?

1:03:13.160 --> 1:03:14.560
-Emotionally.
-Okay.

1:03:16.120 --> 1:03:21.400
Perhaps we should start asking
what actually undermines our relationship.

1:03:22.840 --> 1:03:24.280
What? It's a good question.

1:03:25.320 --> 1:03:27.320
Hold on. And what, for example?

1:03:28.400 --> 1:03:29.600
Well…

1:03:29.680 --> 1:03:31.400
-Yeah. Our phones!
-Huh?

1:03:33.160 --> 1:03:36.160
No. Not just phones.
Everything that comes with it.

1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:40.120
The whole internet,
the constant sensory overload.

1:03:40.640 --> 1:03:41.640
Yes.

1:03:41.720 --> 1:03:44.520
Yes. There is way too much stimulation.

1:03:44.600 --> 1:03:49.640
It's detrimental to our relationships
and makes us unable to relate.

1:03:51.440 --> 1:03:55.600
Look, we're the first generation

1:03:56.120 --> 1:03:58.880
that has to manage
a relationship with the internet.

1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:04.160
Every day, we are told what we should be
or what we are missing out on.

1:04:04.240 --> 1:04:06.400
And then, in our mid-twenties,

1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:10.000
when we think we've found the one…

1:04:11.840 --> 1:04:14.680
we want to marry, and with whom

1:04:16.120 --> 1:04:19.240
we buy outdoor jackets of the same color

1:04:19.760 --> 1:04:25.040
and a house with a garden
and one of those really big trampolines.

1:04:31.600 --> 1:04:34.040
I don't know how my parents did it.

1:04:36.720 --> 1:04:38.520
Well, they didn't swap partners.

1:04:41.440 --> 1:04:44.160
How can this one person
be everything for us?

1:04:45.200 --> 1:04:47.280
No wonder we can't meet that expectation.

1:04:47.360 --> 1:04:49.880
But in order to fail,
you have to try first.

1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:52.360
There are so many solutions.

1:04:52.440 --> 1:04:53.760
What kind of solutions?

1:04:54.600 --> 1:04:58.120
Take your parents as role models?
Just keep sticking it out?

1:04:58.200 --> 1:04:59.720
No, I'm not saying that.

1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:02.800
Some children consciously
set themselves apart from their parents.

1:05:02.880 --> 1:05:04.920
Yes. If they can.

1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:07.200
Yes, you have to have balls for that.

1:05:13.840 --> 1:05:16.200
-Sorry.
-Thanks.

1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:19.120
-No, I didn't mean it like that.
-But you thought it.

1:05:19.200 --> 1:05:22.360
You're a little annoyed.
You really are sensitive.

1:05:22.440 --> 1:05:23.680
I don't find it funny.

1:05:23.760 --> 1:05:27.360
I'll go and make you an egg. There.

1:05:32.520 --> 1:05:34.440
You could've been honest with me.

1:05:37.960 --> 1:05:40.280
You could've been honest with me,

1:05:40.360 --> 1:05:42.760
instead of feeling sorry for yourself
all the time

1:05:42.840 --> 1:05:45.520
and declaring every script
and every role crap.

1:05:45.600 --> 1:05:48.800
I really tried to support you
these last two years.

1:05:48.880 --> 1:05:51.480
I even paid
for your method acting workshops.

1:05:52.120 --> 1:05:52.960
Nina.

1:05:54.920 --> 1:05:57.440
Are you aware of what you're doing?

1:05:59.600 --> 1:06:01.600
You can only point at others.

1:06:02.480 --> 1:06:06.160
When it's about your own problems,
you keep your mouth shut, Nine.

1:06:06.680 --> 1:06:09.600
-Stop calling me Nine.
-I've called you Nine for two years.

1:06:09.680 --> 1:06:11.920
And for two years,
it's made me want to throw up!

1:06:16.120 --> 1:06:18.640
She said throw up.

1:06:19.720 --> 1:06:21.800
Maybe you should switch to water.

1:06:23.400 --> 1:06:24.240
Why?

1:06:25.080 --> 1:06:28.520
An alcohol problem fits well
into the life of a loser, doesn't it?

1:06:28.600 --> 1:06:30.680
Guys, things were going so well.

1:06:30.760 --> 1:06:31.760
You know what?

1:06:32.280 --> 1:06:34.200
I got a lead role in a soap.

1:06:34.280 --> 1:06:36.880
No. Really? Wow. Congratulations, Ben.

1:06:37.760 --> 1:06:38.760
First, eat your egg.

1:06:41.400 --> 1:06:43.040
Maybe I should have told you.

1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:44.560
But be honest.

1:06:44.640 --> 1:06:47.280
You would've left in the end
even if I had told you.

1:06:48.400 --> 1:06:49.440
Why?

1:06:51.720 --> 1:06:55.120
When did I ever give you
the impression that I wanted kids?

1:06:55.880 --> 1:06:57.800
I wanted to have a career.

1:06:58.320 --> 1:07:00.840
And most of all,
I wanted you to have a career.

1:07:01.480 --> 1:07:05.560
If we had wanted children,
there would've been a thousand options.

1:07:06.920 --> 1:07:11.040
Artificial insemination,
sperm donor, adoption, whatever.

1:07:11.880 --> 1:07:15.720
Because your ex-girlfriends left you
for that reason, you think I would have?

1:07:19.200 --> 1:07:20.040
Yes.

1:07:21.800 --> 1:07:24.080
Maybe because
you only fell in love with me

1:07:24.920 --> 1:07:29.840
because an actor is Instagram-worthy
and looks good in couple photos.

1:07:29.920 --> 1:07:31.680
You really believe that?

1:07:39.760 --> 1:07:40.800
Mr. Bolshakov.

1:07:42.160 --> 1:07:43.200
Yes.

1:07:44.400 --> 1:07:47.160
No. We can reschedule. No problem.

1:07:47.240 --> 1:07:48.600
When would be a good time?

1:07:50.240 --> 1:07:51.080
On the 24th?

1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:53.520
No, that works for me.

1:07:53.600 --> 1:07:55.760
Yes. No, I've noted it down.

1:07:55.840 --> 1:07:57.440
Let's do that. No problem.

1:07:57.520 --> 1:08:01.240
Yes. Have a nice weekend. Yeah. Bye.

1:08:06.400 --> 1:08:07.920
We have to keep going somehow.

1:08:09.240 --> 1:08:11.280
We have to find a way, all of us.

1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:14.360
Nine, you are pregnant.

1:08:16.320 --> 1:08:18.360
How do you think you can keep going?

1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:22.280
Pretend nothing happened?

1:08:23.960 --> 1:08:26.040
That worked two years ago.

1:08:29.560 --> 1:08:30.920
What happened two years ago?

1:08:33.320 --> 1:08:35.320
What happened two years ago?

1:08:37.040 --> 1:08:37.920
Those…

1:08:41.760 --> 1:08:43.760
those two have done it before.

1:08:48.160 --> 1:08:49.360
Hey. It's good.

1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:52.760
It's good
that we're finally addressing everything.

1:08:53.360 --> 1:08:54.320
When?

1:08:54.400 --> 1:08:57.440
Does it matter?
Janina didn't know that I knew that.

1:08:57.520 --> 1:08:59.400
-I'm sorry.
-Come on. Shut up.

1:08:59.480 --> 1:09:01.640
No, really, I…

1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:04.240
We weren't even really together then.

1:09:04.320 --> 1:09:06.760
I didn't know
where we were heading and I--

1:09:06.840 --> 1:09:11.080
I see. While I was running after you
like a complete idiot,

1:09:12.440 --> 1:09:14.240
you two slept together,

1:09:14.320 --> 1:09:16.760
and I'm the only one here who has no idea?

1:09:17.280 --> 1:09:19.480
I've played the perfect boyfriend
the whole time.

1:09:20.080 --> 1:09:22.200
And you've been lying to my face
for two years.

1:09:39.360 --> 1:09:40.360
Fuck.

1:09:41.440 --> 1:09:43.920
How did we manage to last for so long?

1:09:49.400 --> 1:09:52.320
You have so many weird habits.
Do you know that?

1:09:52.400 --> 1:09:55.240
It starts with the fact
that we are always late

1:09:55.320 --> 1:09:57.640
because you need the big entrance,

1:09:57.720 --> 1:10:00.360
besides this shitty vegan lifestyle

1:10:00.440 --> 1:10:03.240
and that you have to follow
every stupid trend.

1:10:03.760 --> 1:10:05.880
Your need to always stage yourself

1:10:05.960 --> 1:10:08.360
will eventually take away
your grip on reality.

1:10:08.440 --> 1:10:12.760
In reality, you can't put a nice filter
on your relationships, Nine.

1:10:13.760 --> 1:10:17.640
Or this. How many shows
did we watch together?

1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:19.680
Too many to count.

1:10:20.840 --> 1:10:22.640
How many did we finish watching?

1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:25.560
Yes. Not a single one.

1:10:26.480 --> 1:10:29.440
We don't know
what happened to the fucking dragon queen.

1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:30.840
And why don't we know?

1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:34.680
Because if you like a show,
you don't want to finish it.

1:10:34.760 --> 1:10:38.680
Because it would suck to know the ending
in case you want to watch it again.

1:10:38.760 --> 1:10:43.640
Or, best of all, that you expect me
to eat the raisins you don't like.

1:10:43.720 --> 1:10:48.120
Every time you put your fucking raisins
on my plate, expecting me to eat them.

1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:49.880
I hate raisins.

1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:54.560
But you never asked me. I just ate them.

1:11:00.200 --> 1:11:02.560
Come on. That was a great performance.

1:11:03.160 --> 1:11:05.400
Ben, respect. Really, that was…

1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:09.120
that was <i>Gladiator</i> without a horse.
That was <i>Game of--</i>

1:11:09.200 --> 1:11:11.360
You think this is all funny, right?

1:11:12.720 --> 1:11:16.320
You act like you're my buddy
and fuck my girlfriend.

1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:19.520
Well, you've been fucking
his girlfriend too.

1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:21.160
-So you're even now.
-Yes.

1:11:21.960 --> 1:11:23.560
And you stayed with him?

1:11:23.640 --> 1:11:28.440
Yes. Because he was honest and told me.

1:11:28.520 --> 1:11:30.920
And back then,
I wanted some kind of free pass.

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:35.920
And that free pass to fuck

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:39.560
gives you permission
to screw your buddy's girlfriend.

1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:42.440
Buddy? We hardly knew each other, Ben.
That was…

1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:48.240
-What do you want to hear?
-I don't know. An explanation?

1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:51.000
An apology.

1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:55.640
What good would that do?

1:11:57.080 --> 1:12:01.080
Ben, I think those raisins
are starting to mess with your head.

1:12:03.480 --> 1:12:04.320
Fuck.

1:12:06.760 --> 1:12:07.760
Fuck. Are you crazy?

1:12:19.040 --> 1:12:20.080
It's not that bad.

1:12:20.840 --> 1:12:22.240
His aim wasn't that good.

1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:31.280
I really thought you liked raisins.

1:12:31.360 --> 1:12:33.360
That's all that stuck with you, yeah?

1:12:34.240 --> 1:12:35.280
And, Nils,

1:12:36.080 --> 1:12:39.360
to answer your question
about whether you can see anything

1:12:39.440 --> 1:12:41.560
and to get your imagination going
a little…

1:12:52.880 --> 1:12:53.720
Guys.

1:13:34.080 --> 1:13:35.200
That's the champagne.

1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:39.640
It was 200 euros.

1:13:41.240 --> 1:13:43.640
Just stop with the yuppie talk.

1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:48.040
Let me help you.

1:13:48.120 --> 1:13:49.960
Not with your nose right over it.

1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:54.480
Don't pull. It's okay.

1:13:56.200 --> 1:13:57.160
My gosh.

1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:00.600
Let me do it. Where is it?

1:14:01.240 --> 1:14:02.760
-I can do it.
-No, I'll do it.

1:14:05.360 --> 1:14:06.400
Gee.

1:14:22.800 --> 1:14:24.320
<i>Hey, Janina, it's Ann-Kathrin.</i>

1:14:24.400 --> 1:14:25.920
<i>I've thought about everything again.</i>

1:14:26.000 --> 1:14:30.200
<i>Your swap experiment</i>
<i>makes a great pull. It's fantastic!</i>

1:14:30.280 --> 1:14:34.920
<i>If you can keep going for a bit,</i>
<i>it'll be pure dynamite.</i>

1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:38.440
<i>And your idea</i>
<i>with the pregnancy test, genius.</i>

1:14:38.520 --> 1:14:40.960
<i>-I never thought you'd pull it off.</i>
<i>-</i>Fuck.

1:14:41.040 --> 1:14:42.240
<i>You have balls, girl.</i>

1:14:42.960 --> 1:14:46.720
<i>So, if you like,</i>
<i>you can have your very own column.</i>

1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:10.680
We were all your guinea pigs.

1:16:15.680 --> 1:16:17.320
You staged everything.

1:16:23.520 --> 1:16:25.360
But the test, it was positive.

1:16:27.760 --> 1:16:29.360
-No.
-What?

1:16:29.440 --> 1:16:31.720
It's fake. It's a movie prop.

1:16:34.280 --> 1:16:35.160
I…

1:16:36.360 --> 1:16:37.200
Well, it…

1:16:39.720 --> 1:16:43.000
it somehow just took on a life of its own,
and then

1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:46.280
I didn't know how to get out of it.

1:16:47.120 --> 1:16:48.760
Wait. I'm not going to be a dad?

1:16:58.600 --> 1:16:59.640
In the office,

1:17:00.720 --> 1:17:05.520
they were looking for someone
to try this experiment.

1:17:06.440 --> 1:17:09.040
It was about the editorial board.

1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:13.840
This was the perfect opportunity
to get them to notice me.

1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:25.080
Mr. Bolshakov.

1:17:31.440 --> 1:17:32.800
Mrs. Bolshakov, hello.

1:17:33.320 --> 1:17:34.520
It's the weekend.

1:17:36.160 --> 1:17:37.000
Yes.

1:17:37.640 --> 1:17:39.440
Sure. You can go fuck yourself.

1:17:43.040 --> 1:17:44.400
Sure. Make a complaint.

1:17:45.120 --> 1:17:46.440
Preferably with my father.

1:17:47.120 --> 1:17:50.400
He'll be so pleased
I'm a disappointment to him once again.

1:17:56.280 --> 1:17:58.120
Do you have enough for your article?

1:18:01.280 --> 1:18:04.200
I've always wondered
why you're the only one

1:18:05.400 --> 1:18:10.120
who doesn't understand
how perfect you and Nils are as a couple.

1:18:12.120 --> 1:18:15.120
Instead, you act
like it's an open relationship

1:18:15.200 --> 1:18:16.800
and do your own thing.

1:18:19.000 --> 1:18:22.640
What's so bad about finding the one,

1:18:23.160 --> 1:18:26.800
marrying them,
having kids, and building a house?

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:28.840
And in the end,

1:18:29.720 --> 1:18:34.440
you have one of those damn trampolines
in the garden which ends up neglected.

1:18:35.600 --> 1:18:39.160
But if it's the one,
it doesn't matter what you miss out on

1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:42.440
or what other temptations
may be around you.

1:18:47.600 --> 1:18:48.640
I'm gonna pack.

1:19:06.040 --> 1:19:09.400
I was hoping that
it would be enough if I loved you enough.

1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:11.080
But it's not.

1:19:15.320 --> 1:19:20.560
And, yes,
I am the scheming, ice-cold journalist

1:19:20.640 --> 1:19:23.040
who stops at nothing
to get what she wants.

1:19:23.120 --> 1:19:27.640
And you three, you are the holy Samaritans
who know everything about everything.

1:19:29.760 --> 1:19:30.680
True, no?

1:19:31.440 --> 1:19:34.320
Maybe not,
or we wouldn't have done this swap.

1:19:37.120 --> 1:19:39.400
We sabotaged our own relationships.

1:19:39.480 --> 1:19:41.920
I'm sorry that I ended up hurting you.

1:19:46.160 --> 1:19:47.880
Well.

1:19:48.960 --> 1:19:51.120
We should be honest, at least.

1:19:51.640 --> 1:19:54.080
Yes. We should be honest.

1:19:54.160 --> 1:19:58.360
When were you going to be honest
and tell Maria why you got the champagne?

1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:00.240
What does she mean?

1:20:02.680 --> 1:20:04.320
He wanted to propose to you.

1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:09.080
But four weeks ago,
you were so keen on the partner swap.

1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:19.480
And I finished watching <i>Game of Thrones</i>.

1:20:20.280 --> 1:20:21.880
The dragon queen dies.

1:22:33.720 --> 1:22:34.800
I'm sorry.

1:22:36.480 --> 1:22:38.040
I couldn't get here any faster.

1:22:40.120 --> 1:22:41.840
We've made a mistake.

1:22:42.440 --> 1:22:44.800
I don't understand. What's happening?

1:22:46.480 --> 1:22:49.760
You are the fiancé of my best friend.

1:22:50.960 --> 1:22:52.960
We should have never slept together.

1:22:53.040 --> 1:22:55.360
Hey. We slipped up.

1:22:55.880 --> 1:22:57.280
We talked about it.

1:22:57.360 --> 1:22:59.920
She must never find out.

1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:02.640
That's not possible.

1:23:02.720 --> 1:23:03.760
Why?

1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:08.280
I am pregnant.

1:23:14.720 --> 1:23:16.040
Didn't we use a condom?

1:23:16.120 --> 1:23:18.400
Apparently, it burst.

1:23:18.480 --> 1:23:19.840
And you're not on the pill?

1:23:21.880 --> 1:23:23.440
You have to do another test.

1:23:24.280 --> 1:23:27.360
I've done three tests, John.
I am pregnant.

1:23:28.560 --> 1:23:30.320
Valentina will leave me.

1:23:30.920 --> 1:23:33.360
You're right.
She mustn't find out about this.

1:23:33.440 --> 1:23:37.160
You can't jeopardize what you two have.

1:23:37.240 --> 1:23:39.960
I'm going to be a father.
I can't lie to her.

1:23:40.040 --> 1:23:42.040
You shouldn't lie to her.

1:23:42.120 --> 1:23:44.840
You just don't tell her the truth.

1:23:46.600 --> 1:23:47.960
<i>-Yes.</i>
<i>-Yes.</i>

1:23:48.480 --> 1:23:49.440
<i>You are right.</i>

1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:08.360
No way.

1:24:09.640 --> 1:24:10.520
Look.

1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:15.360
PARTNER SWAP
THE ULTIMATE JOURNEY TO SELF-DISCOVERY?

1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:22.200
Well, ready for your ultrasound?

1:25:16.240 --> 1:25:18.640
Shall I look that way?
I'll look that way, okay?

1:25:20.920 --> 1:25:23.480
I'll stop here briefly,
and then I walk there.

1:25:23.560 --> 1:25:26.800
I just thought of it.
This will be my entire performance.

1:25:32.560 --> 1:25:37.040
Did you really want to or didn't you,

1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:39.000
Maria?

1:25:39.640 --> 1:25:42.120
-Excuse me?
-I'm having a little…

1:25:42.200 --> 1:25:44.240
-Honey, what is it?
-I'm having a stroke.

1:25:47.680 --> 1:25:49.440
Just show me the result.

1:25:58.040 --> 1:25:59.400
One-one, first marker.

1:26:01.360 --> 1:26:03.120
Why did Nils give you the…

1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:05.560
Come on.

1:26:05.640 --> 1:26:07.440
-I'll do the reception again…
-Got it.

1:26:07.520 --> 1:26:08.480
-You got it?
-Yes.

1:26:20.920 --> 1:26:23.040
He'll likely win some shitty award.

1:26:23.120 --> 1:26:25.120
No editorial bond for me, then.

1:26:25.200 --> 1:26:26.040
Board.

1:26:26.960 --> 1:26:28.440
Wait. I'll do it again.

1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:31.000
Of course we can talk. Is it vegan?

1:26:34.880 --> 1:26:36.800
-The cat.
-The cat.

1:26:39.440 --> 1:26:40.440
Marker.

1:26:42.720 --> 1:26:44.640
You are my "gurl."

1:26:46.120 --> 1:26:47.600
Say it "proply." Like "shish."

1:26:47.680 --> 1:26:48.960
No, you are mine.

1:26:49.040 --> 1:26:51.320
No, you are mine. You are my possession.

1:27:02.400 --> 1:27:04.480
-Just a tiny bit.
-You are hardcore.

1:27:05.320 --> 1:27:08.640
"Hard" is really misleading
in this context.

1:27:15.400 --> 1:27:16.800
We have to get it right.

1:27:16.880 --> 1:27:17.840
Sorry. Wow.

1:27:27.280 --> 1:27:28.520
I can't.

1:27:30.520 --> 1:27:32.400
Come on.

1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:39.000
Shit.

1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:47.040
-Guys, this really sucks.
-I'm so sorry.

1:27:47.120 --> 1:27:47.960
Shit.

1:27:54.040 --> 1:27:56.200
I just can't. It doesn't work.

1:27:56.280 --> 1:27:58.160
This is so bad.

1:28:06.760 --> 1:28:07.680
Out!
