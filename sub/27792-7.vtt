00:00.199 --> 00:01.956
Previously, on
<i>"The Magicians"...</i>

00:02.266 --> 00:04.446
Look, just go while you still
have the chance.

00:05.633 --> 00:09.383
The Library controls
the levels of ambient magic

00:09.383 --> 00:12.403
that flow through the pipes.
This one has a leak.

00:14.423 --> 00:17.473
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

00:17.493 --> 00:20.473
It's the talking animals.
They've all been struck dumb.

00:20.473 --> 00:21.443
So what is this?

00:21.453 --> 00:23.473
I saved your
fucking life, bitch.

00:23.473 --> 00:26.443
Margo, are you okay?

00:26.463 --> 00:30.187
You're just a brown-nose sweater
boy desperate to matter at all.

00:30.190 --> 00:33.142
The other me, Sam,
did whatever she thought was right,

00:33.143 --> 00:34.865
regardless of what anybody else thought.

00:34.873 --> 00:37.373
This contract initiates
our services in exchange for...

00:37.393 --> 00:39.523
"Unlimited manual and magical labor"?

00:39.543 --> 00:43.114
"Bound in service to the Library
up to and after my death"?

00:43.119 --> 00:45.463
- Penny, where are you?
- I'm in the Underworld Library.

00:45.473 --> 00:49.513
If you stay down here, you've got
an amazing destiny ahead of you.

01:13.383 --> 01:14.523
Uh, excuse me?

01:14.523 --> 01:18.383
- Mr. Adiyodi?
- Come in. Have a seat.

01:18.383 --> 01:21.433
Is...

01:21.433 --> 01:22.603
Did I do something wrong?

01:22.603 --> 01:24.493
I called you in to talk
about Matilda Fremont.

01:24.493 --> 01:28.553
You shelved her book yesterday
under "Disappointing Prodigies"?

01:28.553 --> 01:30.493
Oh, right.

01:30.493 --> 01:33.463
Uh, mastered the flute at seven
but became a mediocre poet.

01:33.473 --> 01:34.553
Unremarkable.

01:34.573 --> 01:36.493
Did you read her brother's book?

01:36.493 --> 01:37.923
She saved his life...

01:37.924 --> 01:41.684
Pulled him out of a self-destructive
spiral, and he went on to become

01:41.686 --> 01:44.716
one of the world's
greatest philanthropists.

01:44.726 --> 01:46.806
I wouldn't call that
"unremarkable."

01:46.826 --> 01:52.676
Uh, okay. So is there section for,
uh, "Sisters of Generous Men"?

01:53.776 --> 01:55.826
You've been
in the Underworld branch,

01:55.836 --> 01:57.796
um, three weeks?
Well...

01:57.806 --> 01:59.836
Yeah, when I died,
all I cared about

01:59.836 --> 02:03.806
was getting back up there,
and... and all this?

02:03.816 --> 02:05.806
I didn't think it mattered...

02:05.816 --> 02:09.726
Where a book goes, who reads it.

02:09.746 --> 02:12.150
Those books I lent you,
you get a chance to read them?

02:12.151 --> 02:13.936
Of course.

02:14.656 --> 02:15.776
Well, I skimmed.

02:15.776 --> 02:16.876
How far did you get?

02:16.896 --> 02:18.846
Alice, uh, opened a pipe,

02:18.866 --> 02:21.656
accidentally helped blow up
the Modesto branch,

02:21.676 --> 02:24.786
and Quentin played Pictionary
with a mummy.

02:25.776 --> 02:26.846
Where would you file them?

02:26.866 --> 02:27.896
Quentin and Alice...

02:27.906 --> 02:30.686
"Star-Crossed Romances,"
probably,

02:30.686 --> 02:32.826
or "Well-Meaning Failures."

02:32.836 --> 02:34.866
- What about the others?
- Oh...

02:34.876 --> 02:37.846
"Side Characters in Epic Quests."

02:37.866 --> 02:39.716
I'm a side character?

02:39.836 --> 02:40.986
Look, no offense.

02:41.006 --> 02:44.006
It's just... Quentin's the
center of the whole thing.

02:44.016 --> 02:46.016
He's the one
that knows everybody.

02:46.036 --> 02:49.986
He's the one the little British
girl picked to save the world.

02:50.006 --> 02:52.886
Or he's the one
that looks like you.

02:52.896 --> 02:57.016
Not fair. Todd looks like me.
He's not the center of shit.

02:57.036 --> 02:59.856
But he could be.

02:59.876 --> 03:00.916
All I'm saying is you think

03:00.926 --> 03:02.896
you've seen stories
like this before,

03:02.916 --> 03:05.006
so you can guess
what's going to happen...

03:05.016 --> 03:08.006
Who's important and who isn't.

03:08.016 --> 03:11.016
But that's because you are
trapped in your POV.

03:11.036 --> 03:14.986
You have a classic case of
White Male Protagonism, Derek,

03:15.006 --> 03:20.976
and a Librarian simply can't have that. But
that's why these books are so important.

03:20.976 --> 03:26.946
They're such a gift. They... they can
allow you to see other points of view.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.604
And once you start seeing that,

03:29.605 --> 03:32.685
you'll find that the story
doesn't end the way you think,

03:32.705 --> 03:36.615
and the most important
characters aren't who you expect.

03:41.625 --> 03:43.725
Remember back before
all the stuff in Modesto

03:43.735 --> 03:47.615
when Alice first escaped
from the Library?

03:47.625 --> 03:48.765
Oh, dear.

03:48.765 --> 03:53.675
I'm telling you,
I saw a reindeer-driven sleigh fly away.

03:53.685 --> 03:55.615
Alice and Nick are gone.

03:55.635 --> 03:56.705
This is not funny.

03:56.705 --> 04:00.615
I'm not laughing... now.

04:00.615 --> 04:02.555
I mean...
Lets discuss next steps.

04:02.555 --> 04:04.777
Mm, we should wait for Everett.
He'll know how to...

04:04.778 --> 04:05.868
Oh, he'll agree with me
when I say

04:05.868 --> 04:07.838
that Alice Quinn
was your project.

04:07.838 --> 04:10.828
Holding her here was a mistake.
We aren't jailers.

04:10.838 --> 04:12.778
What would you have done?

04:12.788 --> 04:14.838
Alice broke her deal with us.

04:14.848 --> 04:18.827
She tried to turn off all of magic.
That has to have consequences.

04:20.158 --> 04:22.758
Our mission is to preserve
the knowledge of magic.

04:22.759 --> 04:25.959
Alice Quinn is an existential
threat to that knowledge.

04:25.969 --> 04:28.869
Are you suggesting that
we should have killed her...

04:28.879 --> 04:30.869
And Santa Claus?

04:32.769 --> 04:35.939
I'm so sorry.
It's not at all funny.

04:35.949 --> 04:38.849
Do you agree with Cyrus?

04:39.919 --> 04:41.949
I see.

04:41.959 --> 04:46.969
I admit, I took a personal
interest in Alice's rehabilitation.

04:46.989 --> 04:48.949
Perhaps it biased me.

04:48.959 --> 04:50.759
You are correct.

04:50.759 --> 04:52.739
We are not jailers.

04:52.749 --> 04:54.769
Nor are we killers.

04:54.779 --> 04:57.889
So I'll ask again...
What would you have us do?

04:57.899 --> 05:01.869
"Protect the flame of knowledge
no matter the cost."

05:01.879 --> 05:04.480
I believe that's
how the old motto goes.

05:04.481 --> 05:05.521
Everett.

05:05.521 --> 05:06.631
Sorry I was delayed.

05:07.508 --> 05:10.401
The renovation of our Rome branch
ran into some difficulties.

05:10.402 --> 05:13.482
- Have you been briefed on Alice?
- I agree with Zelda.

05:13.502 --> 05:16.542
We are an order of scholars,
not assassins.

05:16.562 --> 05:19.502
So what is
the scholarly solution?

05:19.512 --> 05:22.150
Read their books.
Learn their intentions.

05:22.151 --> 05:25.311
We agreed not to breach privacy
unless there was no other option.

05:25.312 --> 05:27.382
What's the other option?

05:29.392 --> 05:30.532
Uh, okay.

05:30.542 --> 05:35.279
Well, Nick's book has been
taken and presumably destroyed,

05:35.280 --> 05:38.562
but Alice's is still in the Revision Room
having the ending put in.

05:38.582 --> 05:42.412
Which will take days, and if she
and Nick split up, we'll lose them.

05:42.422 --> 05:44.412
There might be another way.

05:44.422 --> 05:46.392
Tracking devices.

05:47.024 --> 05:49.164
Eventually, they'll go
somewhere for help.

05:49.164 --> 05:52.299
There isn't enough ambient to
keep either of them happy long,

05:52.300 --> 05:56.480
- so disperse a Searcher widely and...
- Disperse to whom, though?

05:56.480 --> 05:59.260
I find it unlikely that
Alice or Nick will run into

05:59.261 --> 06:01.140
the hands of
card-carrying Magicians.

06:01.141 --> 06:03.320
- They'll go underground.
- Yes.

06:03.761 --> 06:06.971
- Where the hedge witches are.
- And the hedge witches don't trust us.

06:06.971 --> 06:09.801
- We'll never get them to accept...
- If we do what I'm thinking,

06:09.821 --> 06:12.821
they'll take them
without ever knowing.

06:14.442 --> 06:16.622
Fine. Trackers.

06:16.632 --> 06:18.572
And once Alice's book is back,

06:18.582 --> 06:20.572
if we can verify
she's no longer a threat,

06:20.582 --> 06:22.682
there'd be no need
for further corrective action.

06:22.692 --> 06:24.542
Agreed?

06:28.442 --> 06:29.622
All in favor?

06:35.642 --> 06:37.692
Hmm.

06:37.702 --> 06:43.692
- You seem troubled.
- Thank you, but I'm fine.

06:43.692 --> 06:46.592
I understand.

06:46.612 --> 06:49.632
I see something of Harriet
in Alice, too.

06:49.642 --> 06:53.442
I wish you'd given yourself some
real time to grieve your daughter.

06:53.452 --> 06:57.442
- Leave of absence, even.
- No, I'm...

07:00.912 --> 07:01.922
Uh, I'm sorry.

07:06.982 --> 07:09.692
Zelda.

07:09.702 --> 07:12.892
I thought I heard something.

07:12.912 --> 07:15.742
Excuse me, I have a meeting.

07:23.037 --> 07:27.800
<font color="#00FFFF">Synced & corrected by</font> <font color="#D81D1D">MaxPayne</font>
== <font color="#138CE9">https://</font>subscene<font color="#138CE9">.com</font> ==

07:27.872 --> 07:30.702
So you're telling me
the Head Librarian,

07:30.712 --> 07:32.842
a member of the
Governing Council of the Order,

07:32.862 --> 07:34.752
is having a nervous breakdown?

07:34.752 --> 07:37.319
Trust me, just 'cause she's
seeing shit that no one else sees

07:37.320 --> 07:38.880
doesn't mean
it isn't really there.

07:38.890 --> 07:40.960
Uh, then we got to get
a message to this Everett guy.

07:40.970 --> 07:43.770
- He's in charge, right?
- Can't.

07:43.790 --> 07:44.696
What do you mean?

07:44.697 --> 07:47.250
There's a dragon that connects
the Underworld to the Neitherlands.

07:47.251 --> 07:49.261
We just take a note,
and we shove it up his...

07:49.281 --> 07:52.730
Not how that works.

07:52.734 --> 07:53.884
Look, being down here...

07:53.894 --> 07:55.844
You mean being dead?

07:55.854 --> 07:57.974
It gives you a new perspective.

07:57.984 --> 07:59.894
There's shit we know
is going to happen

07:59.894 --> 08:02.834
that people up there would
give anything to stop.

08:02.834 --> 08:04.834
But we can see
the bigger picture.

08:04.844 --> 08:08.303
It's not our job to stop the
living from doing what they do.

08:08.304 --> 08:14.474
It's our job to appreciate their full life.
We see but do not intervene...

08:14.484 --> 08:16.544
for a lot of good reasons.

08:16.554 --> 08:21.464
I can see this is wigging you out.
Let's start with an easier one.

08:21.774 --> 08:24.784
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

08:24.794 --> 08:26.724
Wait...

08:26.744 --> 08:28.574
I read this one last week.

08:28.584 --> 08:31.784
High King of Fillory gets mad
at, uh, the alpaca lady,

08:31.794 --> 08:36.554
uh, to bring back
the talking animals' voices.

08:36.563 --> 08:37.764
You read Margo's story.

08:37.774 --> 08:39.823
This one is not about her.

08:39.833 --> 08:43.573
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

08:45.754 --> 08:47.694
Oh, hi, there.

08:47.704 --> 08:50.584
Do you have a message, or...?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.604
Oh!

08:56.624 --> 08:58.624
Okay, it was a dream.

08:58.634 --> 08:59.814
Just keep reading.

08:59.824 --> 09:03.754
Well, what's my Birthright,
you scaly shit?

09:05.594 --> 09:07.554
It's the talking animals.

09:07.564 --> 09:10.754
They've all been struck dumb.

09:10.764 --> 09:13.624
Well, shit.

09:13.634 --> 09:16.263
All right, Fen, I think
I will do a ritual.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.214
Earth specialty...
The Sleep of Solitude.

09:18.214 --> 09:23.304
I pop an Ambien, everyone leaves me
alone till noon. That'll be perfect.

09:25.659 --> 09:28.629
Rafe, last night I had
the strangest dream.

09:28.629 --> 09:31.629
There were these bunnies
with their throats...

09:31.629 --> 09:32.829
You know what?

09:32.839 --> 09:35.859
I think I projected
the talking animals going mute.

09:35.869 --> 09:38.829
Okay, I think I'm starting to
get the point of these stories.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.829
All women are just one
emotional crisis away

09:40.839 --> 09:41.879
from a psychotic break.

09:41.879 --> 09:43.629
Jesus, no.

09:43.629 --> 09:46.629
Whoa, you can't say stuff
like that anymore.

09:46.629 --> 09:49.879
- What, in the afterlife?
- Anywhere.

09:49.879 --> 09:53.829
Do you remember what Kady
was doing at this time?

09:53.839 --> 09:57.879
Didn't she just kind of peace out
after the Library Dewey coin heist?

09:57.889 --> 10:01.780
Not exactly. See, while the
others were busy bleeding a stone

10:01.781 --> 10:07.699
to stop the monster, Kady...
was busy doing something else.

10:07.709 --> 10:11.679
Iris could have at least left us a
stone-bleeding how-to or something.

10:11.699 --> 10:14.629
Yeah, I hear
what you're saying, Q.

10:15.719 --> 10:17.909
- Hey.
- Don't mind me.

10:22.889 --> 10:27.699
Uh, I'll go check those other books.
The books in, uh, Marina's library,

10:27.709 --> 10:30.819
'cause, uh, yep, that's got
to be where they are.

10:32.819 --> 10:36.639
Hey. Haven't seen you in a while.

10:36.649 --> 10:38.909
There was some stuff
I had to do.

10:39.629 --> 10:43.889
- Stuff I should be worried about?
- I'm clean.

10:43.899 --> 10:46.659
Good.

10:49.629 --> 10:50.739
Who's this?

10:50.749 --> 10:54.629
Five weeks ago, her dad picked her
up from school and disappeared...

10:54.629 --> 10:55.899
Custody fight with her mom.

10:55.909 --> 11:00.899
Locator spell and a few bruised
knuckles later, she's home.

11:00.909 --> 11:05.669
"Five weeks ago" as in when you
were "Detective Sam Cunningham"?

11:05.679 --> 11:08.859
- You're solving her old case files?
- All right, look...

11:08.869 --> 11:10.899
you lived as Kim for months.

11:10.909 --> 11:13.659
The moment you got
your memory back, you just...

11:13.669 --> 11:16.819
You dropped it
like it never happened.

11:16.829 --> 11:19.859
I-I can't.

11:19.869 --> 11:21.799
I can't go back
to being a sidekick.

11:21.819 --> 11:22.839
- You're not a sidekick.
- Come on.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.699
I'm only in this group at all
because of Penny.

11:26.709 --> 11:28.659
That's not true.

11:28.669 --> 11:30.659
- You and me...
- We're friends, yeah.

11:30.669 --> 11:33.639
And then we weren't,
and now we're what...

11:33.649 --> 11:34.869
I don't know,
whatever you call it when...

11:34.879 --> 11:39.839
you have a lot of history that
made you two very different people.

11:39.849 --> 11:42.739
I need my own path, Jules.

11:43.879 --> 11:46.629
I want my life to feel
like it's about me.

11:46.629 --> 11:50.307
No, I get that.
And I am all for your personal growth.

11:50.308 --> 11:52.168
It's just that we're... You know,
we're kind of under the gun here.

11:52.169 --> 11:55.359
You're under my roof,
hidden from the McAllistairs

11:55.369 --> 11:57.379
and the Library because I took
this place from Marina

11:57.389 --> 12:01.329
when everyone else wanted to
hand her nuclear launch codes.

12:03.319 --> 12:07.289
Look, I'll help, of course...

12:07.299 --> 12:10.539
when I can, in my way.

12:10.549 --> 12:13.399
But for now...

12:13.409 --> 12:16.299
Sam left a few loose ends
I need to tie up.

12:25.299 --> 12:26.399
You're not my Postmate.

12:26.409 --> 12:28.359
I am the Baba Yaga.

12:28.369 --> 12:31.539
You live on my property
under my protection,

12:31.539 --> 12:34.339
and your rent is due.

12:34.359 --> 12:38.329
Okay, well, this isn't
exactly my place.

12:38.339 --> 12:40.339
Well, you're here now,

12:40.359 --> 12:43.379
and the list is clearly posted
on the premises.

12:43.389 --> 12:46.289
Wait, Marina's weird
grocery list on the fridge?

12:46.289 --> 12:47.359
It is not weird.

12:47.369 --> 12:49.329
You are weird.

12:49.339 --> 12:52.409
You reek of nondairy creamer
and despair.

12:54.379 --> 12:56.369
Okay, look, I don't have

12:56.379 --> 12:58.289
whatever it is
that you're looking for.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.359
One Webster's Weeping Healer,

13:00.369 --> 13:02.499
one Totem of the Plump Pelican,

13:02.509 --> 13:04.509
and one Bag of Holding.

13:04.519 --> 13:10.389
Pay what is owed in two days'
time or wish I boiled you alive.

13:10.399 --> 13:12.289
The wench will explain.

13:12.289 --> 13:13.399
What?

13:20.379 --> 13:22.539
Holy shit, you have to pay her.

13:22.549 --> 13:26.045
"Her"? You mean you.
Okay, what the fuck is happening?

13:26.046 --> 13:30.299
I'm Bailey. Sorry about the Baba Yaga.
She can be a little...

13:30.309 --> 13:32.409
The Baba's the spirit
of a vengeful Slavic witch

13:32.419 --> 13:34.369
I channel when I need
to collect rent

13:34.379 --> 13:36.329
or deal with a chatty
Uber driver.

13:36.339 --> 13:38.339
So if you don't want to be
her next meal,

13:38.359 --> 13:39.559
you should give her
what she wants.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.389
Ooh, stressful.

13:41.399 --> 13:44.359
Where am I supposed to find...

13:44.369 --> 13:45.529
Wait a minute.

13:45.539 --> 13:46.529
Is the...

13:46.539 --> 13:50.289
The Totem of the Plump Pelican.

13:50.539 --> 13:52.289
Wait, this thing?

13:52.299 --> 13:53.449
Oh, yeah, that's it.

13:53.459 --> 13:58.058
Oh. Marina must have found it. I just
thought it was some ugly paperweight.

13:58.059 --> 13:59.369
Shh, don't insult it.

13:59.379 --> 14:00.569
It reacts.

14:01.289 --> 14:03.359
So two more to go.

14:03.369 --> 14:06.309
Oh, shit.
She's coming back.

14:09.389 --> 14:13.549
Pay me what is owed, or I
will boil your marrow into soup, peasant.

14:15.539 --> 14:17.379
See you Thursday.

14:25.532 --> 14:28.272
I'm looking for a guy
called "Lovelady."

14:28.272 --> 14:30.302
Heard he has office hours here.

14:38.315 --> 14:39.405
What is this?

14:39.415 --> 14:40.475
Some kind of flashlight spell?

14:40.485 --> 14:43.405
Isik.

14:51.910 --> 14:53.080
- Jesus.
- Whoa!

14:53.100 --> 14:54.960
Satisfied?

14:55.382 --> 14:56.287
What the hell was that?

14:56.288 --> 14:58.285
I never want to see the floor
of a bar that bright.

14:58.296 --> 15:00.046
Pete?

15:00.056 --> 15:02.316
Wait, you're Lovelady?

15:02.326 --> 15:04.236
Oh, shit.

15:04.246 --> 15:06.096
Kady.

15:06.116 --> 15:07.296
It's been a while.

15:07.306 --> 15:10.196
Last time I saw you,
you were with Marina.

15:10.206 --> 15:11.326
Mm.

15:11.792 --> 15:13.402
We parted ways.
It was mutual.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.425
Mm, I'm sure.

15:16.962 --> 15:20.080
- So "Lovelady," huh?
- It's a title.

15:20.329 --> 15:21.309
When one guy's done with it,

15:21.319 --> 15:24.441
he passes it on to the next guy,
kind of like "Dread Pirate Roberts"

15:24.443 --> 15:25.503
or "Senator."

15:25.513 --> 15:28.473
That's not how Senators work.

15:28.483 --> 15:30.443
Whatever.

15:30.453 --> 15:32.393
The guy who was "Lovelady
before me

15:32.403 --> 15:34.533
is an Earl
with a private island.

15:34.543 --> 15:36.443
People respect
the shit out of me.

15:36.453 --> 15:39.413
It's a great sign when
you have to tell people that.

15:39.423 --> 15:43.483
Did you come here looking
for my help or...?

15:43.503 --> 15:45.593
Sorry.

15:47.483 --> 15:52.503
Here's a list.
I heard you can find things.

15:52.513 --> 15:55.583
Interesting stuff.
Specific.

15:55.593 --> 15:58.383
Landlord issue.

15:58.393 --> 15:59.393
Have you considered moving?

15:59.403 --> 16:02.333
The place has special features.

16:02.343 --> 16:04.393
It just turns out it's courtesy
of a-a witch...

16:04.403 --> 16:07.583
- Uh, Baba-something.
- You mean the Baba Yaga?

16:07.593 --> 16:11.433
- You know her?
- Just by reputation.

16:11.443 --> 16:13.483
Hey, if I help you,

16:13.503 --> 16:17.483
in lieu of my usual fee,
I want you to introduce me.

16:17.503 --> 16:21.313
- Not sure she's your type.
- She's got great taste.

16:21.323 --> 16:25.403
This could open up
a whole new avenue for me.

16:25.413 --> 16:29.513
Yeah, fine, whatever.
You'll help?

16:29.523 --> 16:33.483
One more thing.
Um, do you still see Julia?

16:33.503 --> 16:35.523
Don't be a creep, Pete.

16:35.533 --> 16:37.513
Where are we going?

16:39.433 --> 16:41.403
Black Market.

16:41.413 --> 16:44.443
So Kady's moved on.

16:44.453 --> 16:47.363
I mean, not with Pete, just...

16:47.383 --> 16:51.433
I know what you mean,
and I'm happy for her.

16:51.443 --> 16:53.443
You don't look happy.

16:53.453 --> 16:59.259
So is there some sort of connection
I'm supposed to be seeing between Kady,

16:59.260 --> 17:01.390
Zelda, Fen...

17:01.400 --> 17:03.290
You'll see.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.250
Alice's book had been revised,

17:05.260 --> 17:09.190
but Alice had changed
the ending.

17:09.200 --> 17:11.200
- Well?
- Apparently, Alice feels

17:11.210 --> 17:13.290
magic has caused her
nothing but trouble.

17:13.300 --> 17:14.290
She goes on to live out

17:14.300 --> 17:16.369
an entirely civilian life
in Portland.

17:16.380 --> 17:19.220
She just got a job
at a craft brewery,

17:19.230 --> 17:20.369
and a Shih Tzu.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.300
You look a little surprised.

17:22.310 --> 17:24.300
Does that not sound like her?

17:24.310 --> 17:27.240
The choice is unexpected, but...

17:27.250 --> 17:30.350
wouldn't be the first time
she walked away from magic.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.300
Great, then.

17:32.310 --> 17:33.310
Nick is still at large,

17:33.320 --> 17:35.380
so we'll keep our trackers
in circulation,

17:35.390 --> 17:38.330
but I think we can close
the book on Alice Quinn.

17:38.340 --> 17:40.400
It's funny...

17:40.400 --> 17:43.340
I'd always thought
she was a cat person.

17:45.210 --> 17:47.380
Never seen her before.
Sorry.

17:47.390 --> 17:50.250
She would be a new hire.

17:50.260 --> 17:52.310
We're not hiring right now.

17:52.320 --> 17:54.300
In fact, we've had
to let some people go.

17:54.310 --> 17:57.160
Designer hops
are getting expensive.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.250
Well?

18:05.260 --> 18:08.180
Alice is inside,
as her book said.

18:08.190 --> 18:11.160
Hmm.
Good riddance, book tart.

18:11.170 --> 18:13.320
Let's go get some doughnuts.

18:17.390 --> 18:19.350
This is the Black Market?

18:19.360 --> 18:21.360
It's so...
Normal?

18:21.370 --> 18:23.290
- Yeah.
- Exactly.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.190
You'd be surprised
what you can find in here.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.410
Even Deweys.

18:27.420 --> 18:29.370
Wait, I thought you had to
have a Library card for that?

18:29.380 --> 18:32.180
Yeah, well, the Library
should know better

18:32.190 --> 18:34.220
than to give
unlimited black cards

18:34.230 --> 18:35.230
to rich druggie dickbags

18:35.240 --> 18:37.300
that trade them in
for lap dances.

18:37.310 --> 18:39.260
Oh, so you give lap dances, huh?

18:39.280 --> 18:42.210
Selectively.

18:42.220 --> 18:44.320
Okay, so that is Whitley.

18:44.330 --> 18:46.200
If she does not have
a Bag of Holding,

18:46.210 --> 18:47.350
she'll have a line on one.

18:47.757 --> 18:48.807
What, you're not gonna
introduce me?

18:48.817 --> 18:51.737
Well, I may have
had sex with her

18:51.747 --> 18:52.932
and never called her again.

18:52.933 --> 18:54.923
Classy.

18:54.933 --> 18:58.033
Hey, I'm looking
for a Bag of Holding...

18:58.043 --> 19:00.083
whatever that is.

19:00.093 --> 19:02.083
It's a "Doctor Who"
kind of thing.

19:02.093 --> 19:03.983
A bag that's bigger
on the inside.

19:03.993 --> 19:05.973
Actually, it's a D&D thing.

19:05.983 --> 19:07.083
Yeah, I don't do nerd shit.

19:07.093 --> 19:08.943
Expensive taste for someone

19:08.953 --> 19:12.093
who doesn't know
what they're asking for.

19:12.103 --> 19:15.033
I can pay.

19:15.043 --> 19:17.043
Charisma Cufflinks...

19:17.053 --> 19:19.033
for a Bag of Holding?

19:19.043 --> 19:21.983
Come back when you're serious.

19:29.724 --> 19:32.354
Kraken tentacles...
Helps build muscle.

19:32.356 --> 19:33.182
I'm paleo.

19:33.183 --> 19:35.353
Cavemen didn't eat kraken,
so I don't eat kraken.

19:38.173 --> 19:40.253
What'll you give me for these?

19:50.847 --> 19:52.389
Aleister Crowley's ashes.

19:52.390 --> 19:54.350
- Mm-hmm.
- Not bad.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.460
Worth a Bag of Holding?

20:02.370 --> 20:04.510
Thanks.

20:06.910 --> 20:08.018
What the hell, Pete?

20:08.019 --> 20:09.989
I searched the whole
goddamn market for you.

20:09.999 --> 20:11.999
Kady, great news.

20:12.009 --> 20:13.009
I found Gordy.

20:13.019 --> 20:16.009
Gordy's my, um...

20:16.019 --> 20:18.069
He's great.
Hi, Kaitlin.

20:18.079 --> 20:19.119
Kady.

20:19.856 --> 20:21.896
You were supposed to be looking

20:21.896 --> 20:23.896
for the Webster's
Weeping Whatever,

20:23.896 --> 20:24.942
not getting wasted.

20:24.943 --> 20:26.953
¿Por qué no los dos, mamacita?

20:26.963 --> 20:30.863
I'll have you know
Gordy is a doctor.

20:30.873 --> 20:33.447
- Well...
- For animals.

20:33.504 --> 20:36.294
You know, for dogs and cats.

20:36.304 --> 20:37.454
Don't sell yourself short,
all right?

20:37.464 --> 20:38.494
That's a real doctor.
Ok... shh, shh, shh.

20:38.504 --> 20:40.454
Not helpful.

20:40.464 --> 20:43.494
Yes, helpful,
because Gordy knows

20:43.504 --> 20:46.404
where to get that thing
that you're looking for.

20:46.414 --> 20:49.374
The thing. The creepy doll
that cries healing tears.

20:49.384 --> 20:51.434
Webster's Weeping Healer.

20:51.444 --> 20:54.454
Got a buddy, Duke...
Exotic-bird guy.

20:54.464 --> 20:56.494
So his cockatoo
caught bumblefoot...

20:56.504 --> 20:58.314
Okay, shh.

20:58.324 --> 20:59.404
Duke has the doll?

20:59.414 --> 21:01.244
Well, yeah.

21:01.244 --> 21:02.514
Okay, where can I find him?

21:07.424 --> 21:10.244
Hello?
Anybody there?

21:13.424 --> 21:16.374
I'm guessing no one's home.

21:22.514 --> 21:25.374
Well, that explains it.

21:27.366 --> 21:29.640
No sign of blunt-force trauma
or defensive wounds.

21:30.366 --> 21:32.296
Doesn't look like foul play.

21:32.306 --> 21:34.296
Okay, Mariska Hargitay.

21:34.306 --> 21:37.336
Just find the doll, will you?

21:50.286 --> 21:55.336
No, bad touch!
Get off!

21:55.346 --> 21:57.246
God, I hate this place.

21:57.256 --> 22:00.296
But...
found the doll.

22:00.306 --> 22:02.186
Ugh.

22:02.196 --> 22:06.246
Healing tears or no,
I would not keep this thing in my house.

22:08.376 --> 22:10.276
Really, Pete?

22:10.286 --> 22:12.276
What?
He's not using it.

22:12.286 --> 22:14.356
You're disgusting.

22:28.356 --> 22:31.266
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

22:36.856 --> 22:37.886
Jesus, Fen!

22:37.896 --> 22:39.840
Why the hell are you lurking
in a dark pantry?

22:39.849 --> 22:40.999
Waiting for you.

22:41.009 --> 22:43.079
Your soufflé fell.
You're gonna bake a new one.

22:43.089 --> 22:45.979
- How did you...
- Dreamt it.

22:47.839 --> 22:50.979
You're worried Margo is gonna
blow talks with Lady Pike.

22:50.989 --> 22:54.069
Wait, again with
the alpaca lady?

22:54.079 --> 22:55.929
Sorry.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.969
Uh, some of these pages
are out of order.

22:57.979 --> 22:59.939
Just keep reading.

22:59.949 --> 23:01.596
But really, you're worried
that you and she have

23:01.597 --> 23:03.577
a true connection and you're
going to screw it up,

23:03.587 --> 23:04.657
so you're stress-baking.

23:04.667 --> 23:05.763
Okay, ouch.

23:05.764 --> 23:08.724
And that's a weirdly specific
and accurate dream.

23:08.734 --> 23:10.564
I also dreamt
of dancing ears of corn,

23:10.574 --> 23:12.654
and then the farmers reported
a surplus.

23:12.664 --> 23:14.574
I dreamt about what Tick
really does

23:14.584 --> 23:15.764
with all those peaches
he steals from the kitchen,

23:15.774 --> 23:17.824
which is surprisingly not gross.

23:17.834 --> 23:20.674
And they've all come true.

23:20.694 --> 23:23.714
Prophetic dreams could mean
a lot of things.

23:23.724 --> 23:25.734
Uh, maybe you're a psychic

23:25.744 --> 23:28.574
or someone cast some kind
of spell on you.

23:28.584 --> 23:31.724
Or... or it's Fillory, and maybe
you just ate some messed-up fruit.

23:31.734 --> 23:33.734
You think someone
did this to me?

23:33.744 --> 23:35.634
If you're worried,
next time it happens

23:35.644 --> 23:37.704
just poke around the dream
a little.

23:37.714 --> 23:39.714
Poke with what?
A knife?

23:40.217 --> 23:41.317
No.
No knives.

23:41.327 --> 23:43.277
Lucid dreaming.

23:43.287 --> 23:45.207
They teach it first semester
at Brakebills.

23:45.217 --> 23:46.327
The second you realize
you're dreaming,

23:46.337 --> 23:48.257
you can take control
of your dream.

23:48.267 --> 23:52.077
- You don't even need magic to do it.
- Just close your eyes...

23:52.087 --> 23:56.307
Breathe, and try to push your
finger through your other hand.

23:56.564 --> 23:57.906
Everything freezes.

23:57.908 --> 24:01.928
Anything not supposed to be there,
that's when you'll be able to tell.

24:01.938 --> 24:03.928
Alice wasn't where
her book said she'd be.

24:03.938 --> 24:06.938
I suspect she sabotaged it.

24:06.948 --> 24:09.978
And now I've lied
to my colleagues.

24:09.988 --> 24:13.928
If I don't find her
before they find out...

24:13.938 --> 24:15.968
Sounds like a personal problem.

24:17.908 --> 24:20.838
Henry, please.

24:20.848 --> 24:22.748
I'm trusting you.

24:22.758 --> 24:24.748
What you mean is that you trust

24:24.748 --> 24:25.958
that I won't report this

24:25.968 --> 24:27.938
because it'd be worse for Alice.

24:27.948 --> 24:29.898
We both want to spare her that.

24:29.908 --> 24:31.758
If you could just tell me
where she is...

24:31.768 --> 24:35.028
I comply with every request...

24:35.748 --> 24:38.898
All your red tape
and your triplicate bullshit.

24:41.748 --> 24:44.878
This is your mess.
Do not drag me into it.

25:08.958 --> 25:11.018
Harriet?

25:38.008 --> 25:41.888
I don't think an ancient Slavic
witch is gonna want a mojito.

25:41.898 --> 25:45.018
Right, um...
something vodka-based?

25:45.028 --> 25:48.948
- Are you actually nervous?
- Baba Yaga's a really big deal

25:48.958 --> 25:50.898
in my line of work, and...

25:50.908 --> 25:53.848
First impressions...

25:53.858 --> 25:56.978
- What was I saying?
- Pete, your arm.

25:56.988 --> 26:03.788
Ah... that molest-y
hand gave me the clap.

26:03.798 --> 26:05.798
Oh, shit.

26:07.119 --> 26:08.680
Looks like
a bad spell interaction.

26:08.931 --> 26:11.421
Something's clashing with one
of his personal enchantments.

26:11.423 --> 26:12.413
Which personal enchantment?

26:12.423 --> 26:14.263
I don't know.
They're personal.

26:14.804 --> 26:16.944
Hedge spells, you know,
they're off the street at best.

26:16.954 --> 26:18.764
They got a lot of rough edges.

26:18.946 --> 26:20.796
There's really no telling
if they'll play nice together

26:20.796 --> 26:22.838
until, well, they don't.

26:23.020 --> 26:25.190
Whatever killed Duke
is killing him.

26:25.190 --> 26:28.130
So help him,
or I break your jaw.

26:28.130 --> 26:30.200
Look, the only human
diagnostic spell I know

26:30.200 --> 26:32.620
costs magic, and I'm a little
Dewey-light at the mo...

26:32.621 --> 26:34.605
Please don't break my jaw.

26:34.615 --> 26:35.815
Fine.

26:35.825 --> 26:38.585
Pete has one he took off
your friend Duke.

26:38.595 --> 26:41.765
Wait. Wait, you said
something's clashing with Pete.

26:41.775 --> 26:42.855
Mm-hmm.

26:42.865 --> 26:45.605
- Like what?
- Like a cursed object.

26:45.615 --> 26:47.585
I once treated a horse
for strangles.

26:47.595 --> 26:49.615
Turns out jockey's riding crop
interacted badly

26:49.625 --> 26:51.795
with a hoof-protection
spell, so...

26:51.805 --> 26:53.815
Does Pete carry a riding crop?

26:53.825 --> 26:56.735
Okay, maybe just look at this.

26:57.835 --> 26:59.635
Cobalt.

26:59.645 --> 27:00.835
Don't touch that shit.

27:00.845 --> 27:02.835
Not really planning to
now that you licked it.

27:02.845 --> 27:04.755
What?
It's more accurate than lenses.

27:04.765 --> 27:05.745
You can taste cobalt.

27:05.755 --> 27:07.655
It's used in most
tracking spells.

27:07.665 --> 27:08.805
- "Tracking spells"?
- Mm-hmm.

27:08.815 --> 27:10.065
I put them on pets.

27:10.069 --> 27:11.805
This one tastes like
a real expensive Searcher.

27:11.806 --> 27:14.210
You hold it long enough,
it kind of sends out

27:14.211 --> 27:16.151
a signal to whoever cast it.

27:16.161 --> 27:19.680
- Wait, a-a signal to wh... who?
- Aliens.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.691
I was thinking more like
who makes Deweys.

27:22.411 --> 27:24.061
- The Library.
- Oh, yeah.

27:24.411 --> 27:25.631
That makes more sense.

27:25.641 --> 27:27.691
Who's the Library looking for?

27:28.411 --> 27:29.661
Oh, I can think of a few people.

27:29.671 --> 27:32.611
Wait, how many hedges have
these personal enchantments?

27:32.621 --> 27:34.631
Pretty much everybody.

27:34.641 --> 27:36.431
Shit.

27:36.441 --> 27:38.451
Take off all of Pete's, now.

27:38.461 --> 27:39.661
What are you gonna do?

27:39.671 --> 27:41.611
I'm gonna warn everybody.

27:41.621 --> 27:42.661
Wait a second.

27:42.671 --> 27:45.641
So the Library's responsible
for hedge witches dying?

27:45.651 --> 27:47.641
Yeah, but they don't
know that yet.

27:47.651 --> 27:49.561
Spoiler alert.

27:49.571 --> 27:51.591
Zelda had some other things
on her mind at the time.

27:51.601 --> 27:53.431
Her dead daughter.

27:53.441 --> 27:56.481
Wait, is she, like, down here?

27:56.491 --> 27:59.431
I thought you didn't
like spoilers.

27:59.686 --> 28:00.926
Look, I'm sorry
you see dead people,

28:00.936 --> 28:02.886
but that is
an incredibly stupid idea.

28:02.896 --> 28:05.419
She's not dead.
Ghosts don't bleed.

28:05.420 --> 28:08.406
I don't know how,
but she could be alive stuck in there.

28:08.407 --> 28:10.387
That's insane...
And impossible.

28:10.397 --> 28:11.527
It's the Mirror Realm.

28:11.537 --> 28:14.417
We don't know what's impossible.

28:14.427 --> 28:16.417
It's not as complicated
as a mirror bridge.

28:16.427 --> 28:18.547
We just need to open a door
to the place between mirrors.

28:18.557 --> 28:20.417
Listen, Zelds,
if you told me you wanted

28:20.427 --> 28:22.337
to finger-paint your blood
so you could take a walk

28:22.347 --> 28:24.557
in the crazy dimension
I would say, "Free country."

28:24.567 --> 28:27.357
But this is my blood.

28:27.367 --> 28:29.387
I can't do this...

28:29.397 --> 28:30.577
without your help.

28:30.587 --> 28:32.387
Yes, I know that.

28:32.397 --> 28:34.437
And I'm leaving.
She's my daughter.

28:37.337 --> 28:39.367
Harriet...

28:39.377 --> 28:40.587
who's older than you?

28:40.597 --> 28:44.357
Our relationship is complicated.

28:44.367 --> 28:45.557
Clearly.

28:45.567 --> 28:49.597
You smashed the mirror.
You...

28:49.607 --> 28:51.377
trapped her there.

28:51.387 --> 28:52.447
I was doing my job.

28:52.467 --> 28:55.557
I can't...

28:55.567 --> 28:59.407
Live with myself if I don't
find a way to help her.

29:02.547 --> 29:04.557
Please.

29:06.357 --> 29:09.607
Christ.

29:09.617 --> 29:11.597
I'm gonna regret this, aren't I?

29:15.337 --> 29:18.517
- Did you juice the beets?
- Oh, I juiced the beets.

29:18.527 --> 29:20.337
I told you I would
juice the beets.

29:20.337 --> 29:23.437
Why wouldn't I juice the beets?
Don't make this about us.

29:23.447 --> 29:25.337
Wait, did I miss something?

29:25.347 --> 29:26.607
I thought Margo and Josh

29:26.617 --> 29:29.537
were an unlikely
yet heartwarming thing.

29:29.547 --> 29:32.357
No, this is after
the Lady Pike incident.

29:32.367 --> 29:34.567
Margo called Josh a sweater boy.

29:34.577 --> 29:36.337
Forget it.

29:36.347 --> 29:37.517
Pay attention to Fen.

29:37.527 --> 29:39.437
How's this shit work?

29:39.447 --> 29:43.537
Pour it gently
onto the lizard, Your Majesty.

29:53.577 --> 29:57.387
Jesus lizard-fucking Christ!

30:00.407 --> 30:05.377
Does this feel like a weird
sort of dream to any of you?

30:09.577 --> 30:12.437
All right, maybe I can
control this.

30:18.377 --> 30:22.427
Ember's balls.
This is a dream.

30:22.437 --> 30:26.397
Okay, okay. Stop talking to
yourself and, uh, look around.

30:28.417 --> 30:32.587
Hey! Who are you?
Wait, no! Stop, please!

30:32.587 --> 30:36.387
Freeze! Freeze!
Hey, hey, stop!

30:36.397 --> 30:40.587
Freeze! Green Lady! Hold up!
Hey, Green Lady, come back!

30:45.337 --> 30:47.557
Umber's ass,
this is getting annoying.

30:58.397 --> 31:01.617
Hey, wait!
Wait, I just want to talk!

31:02.337 --> 31:04.367
Why am I having
these stupid dreams?

31:04.377 --> 31:07.437
Oh, no. The lizard.

31:07.447 --> 31:10.387
You pour it gently
onto the lizard, Your Majesty.

31:10.397 --> 31:12.367
Wait, stop!
It'll catch fire!

31:12.377 --> 31:13.547
The fuck?

31:13.557 --> 31:19.357
I saw the lizard
blow up when Rafe...

31:19.367 --> 31:20.577
Antidote.

31:20.587 --> 31:22.577
What is she talking about?

31:22.587 --> 31:24.417
Perhaps she's mad with grief

31:24.427 --> 31:26.577
over the loss of King Eliot,
Your Majesty.

31:26.587 --> 31:30.557
I assure you, all the animals have
responded quite positively to the antidote.

31:30.567 --> 31:33.347
Well, this one definitely won't.

31:33.357 --> 31:35.577
Foosh.
Fried Lizard.

31:35.587 --> 31:38.417
And where are you getting
this information?

31:42.397 --> 31:43.577
I...

31:43.587 --> 31:45.427
I dreamt it.

31:45.437 --> 31:48.557
Fen has been having
kind of prophetic dreams.

31:48.567 --> 31:51.447
She knew my soufflé was gonna
fall before that ever happened.

31:51.467 --> 31:53.980
- It's a stupid fucking premonition.
- You want to risk the life of your lizard,

31:53.981 --> 31:56.191
or is that a relationship you're
willing to set fire to as well?

31:56.201 --> 31:58.041
Oh, I'll fucking fry
this lizard.

31:58.061 --> 32:00.470
Okay, can we...
can we focus for one minute?

32:00.471 --> 32:01.420
- Sure.
- Yes.

32:01.421 --> 32:02.529
- Fine.
- Let's.

32:02.530 --> 32:03.530
- Cool.
- Great.

32:03.540 --> 32:05.500
Okay.

32:05.510 --> 32:08.500
Say I don't dose
Newt Scamander with beet juice.

32:08.510 --> 32:11.530
How the shit am I supposed
to get his wrinkly ass talking?

32:11.540 --> 32:16.480
I don't know, but I have an idea
of where to look for answers.

32:16.490 --> 32:17.710
I lucid-dreamed.

32:18.430 --> 32:20.450
I saw a woman in a green hood.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.530
She has to be the one
giving me premonitions.

32:22.540 --> 32:26.440
- Awesome. You got it working. A-plus.
- B minus.

32:26.450 --> 32:27.610
Unless...

32:27.620 --> 32:30.530
you tell us
where this green bitch went.

32:30.540 --> 32:33.590
Well, in my dream,
I chased her to this stream

32:33.600 --> 32:36.500
by the Fuschia Forest
of Corian's Land.

32:36.510 --> 32:38.580
Corian's Land...

32:38.590 --> 32:41.460
also known as Sloth's Bane.

32:41.470 --> 32:44.430
I don't know what everything
in my dreams means... mean.

32:44.430 --> 32:49.510
Anyway, I know that the answers to our
questions... Answers lie... lay there?

32:49.520 --> 32:51.460
I-I'm not usually the one

32:51.470 --> 32:53.570
who gives the big speech, so I'm...
I'm going.

32:53.580 --> 32:56.590
So that... that's happening.

33:04.501 --> 33:06.491
Gordy says "you're welcome."

33:06.501 --> 33:08.531
And he left you a bill.

33:08.541 --> 33:11.661
That guy puts a really
high value on his time.

33:14.601 --> 33:16.601
Wait, did I miss the Baba Yaga?

33:16.621 --> 33:18.671
Well, you snooze, you lose.

33:18.681 --> 33:21.491
I wasn't snoozing, I was dying.

33:21.501 --> 33:23.701
We got bigger fish to fry.

33:23.711 --> 33:28.501
I'll explain everything as soon as
your hedge witch friends get here.

33:31.521 --> 33:35.701
I know every instinct is telling
you not to trust me... or anyone.

33:35.711 --> 33:39.491
But someone put a tracker on this.

33:39.501 --> 33:43.691
It's a complex, expensive,
very high-level spell.

33:49.771 --> 33:51.621
It marked him.

33:51.621 --> 33:55.501
It looks like the Deweys you touched
are doing the same to you.

33:55.521 --> 33:57.541
If you have any
enchantments running...

33:57.561 --> 34:00.621
Anything you got in a safe house,
anything homebrewed... It could kill you...

34:00.641 --> 34:04.491
just like it did to Duke
and almost did to Pete.

34:05.621 --> 34:10.371
She saved my life.
I trust her, and I vouch for her.

34:10.385 --> 34:14.775
- Who did this?
- The Library.

34:14.775 --> 34:16.288
They make the Deweys,
and they don't give a shit

34:16.289 --> 34:18.369
about what happens
to the hedges.

34:18.369 --> 34:21.289
They're trying to find someone,

34:21.309 --> 34:23.349
and we're just
collateral damage.

34:23.349 --> 34:26.329
So ask yourselves...
If this is what they do

34:26.329 --> 34:29.329
when they're not even
thinking about us,

34:29.329 --> 34:32.329
what happens when they decide
we're a threat?

34:35.409 --> 34:39.389
Are we just gonna let people like
them tell us we're not important?

34:42.208 --> 34:47.329
That we're just some side characters
in their fucked-up fascist plot?

34:47.329 --> 34:55.188
My mom was a hedge...
and she was killed by another hedge.

34:55.188 --> 34:57.389
You'd think that would
turn me against you.

35:00.349 --> 35:02.369
But it didn't.

35:02.389 --> 35:06.309
It just made me realize that
it doesn't have to be this way.

35:06.309 --> 35:11.249
If we could stop screwing each other
over long enough to work together,

35:11.269 --> 35:14.409
then it's not
the Library's story.

35:14.429 --> 35:17.369
It's our story.

35:24.209 --> 35:25.249
- Hey.
- Hey.

35:25.249 --> 35:27.249
I have a buddy in Modesto.

35:27.249 --> 35:30.209
He says there's a leaky
Library pipe there.

35:30.229 --> 35:33.249
I say we use it
to make those assholes pay.

35:33.249 --> 35:34.349
Look, I know
what you're going through...

35:34.349 --> 35:36.749
Do you?
They kill your boyfriend?

35:36.751 --> 35:37.911
Actually, yeah.

35:41.329 --> 35:42.877
Look, we'll figure out
what to do next.

35:42.879 --> 35:43.959
I already know what to do.

35:43.979 --> 35:47.939
You do that, you're giving
them a reason to wipe us out.

35:47.939 --> 35:51.849
Please just get a little sleep.
We'll talk tomorrow.

35:51.859 --> 35:54.059
Hey, you're not alone, okay?

35:54.079 --> 35:57.079
We'll figure this out together in
a way that feels right for you.

35:59.019 --> 36:00.959
Okay.

36:00.979 --> 36:02.939
Yeah, we can do that.

36:15.099 --> 36:19.019
It's a copy of our library,
but wrong.

36:21.129 --> 36:23.879
I was gonna say
a total mindfuck.

36:23.879 --> 36:25.939
Tomato, tomah-to.

36:28.129 --> 36:29.979
Oh, you go on.

36:29.999 --> 36:32.979
I'll just be here cutting myself
to keep our bloody exit open.

36:32.999 --> 36:35.079
Hey, just made a joke.

36:45.999 --> 36:48.019
Hello?

38:34.959 --> 38:36.039
Where have you been?

38:36.059 --> 38:40.230
Your funhouse-mirror daughter
shanked me. We have to go.

38:40.231 --> 38:41.160
Those things weren't her.

38:41.166 --> 38:42.664
The real Harriet
could still be in here.

38:42.668 --> 38:43.704
I can't just leave her.

38:43.707 --> 38:44.927
I hate to break it
to you, love...

38:44.927 --> 38:46.767
She might still be in there,
but so are those monsters.

39:06.757 --> 39:07.757
An attack?

39:07.777 --> 39:08.817
On what branch?

39:08.817 --> 39:11.757
Modesto, California.

39:11.757 --> 39:13.897
We lost four Librarians.

39:13.897 --> 39:15.817
Hedge witches did it.

39:15.837 --> 39:17.757
But... but why?

39:20.797 --> 39:24.737
There was some fallout
from your tracker coins.

39:24.757 --> 39:26.817
It's not your fault.

39:26.817 --> 39:28.857
Just unforeseen interaction.

39:28.877 --> 39:30.917
Several hedges died.

39:30.927 --> 39:35.877
The whole point of doing this was
to avoid having to hurt anyone.

39:35.897 --> 39:37.817
I should have been here.

39:37.817 --> 39:39.717
You can't blame yourself.

39:39.737 --> 39:42.797
If anything, today we learned
the true danger we're in

39:42.797 --> 39:45.797
and that your trackers
might provide a solution.

39:47.737 --> 39:48.917
What do you mean?

39:48.927 --> 39:51.777
Complications aside...

39:51.777 --> 39:53.737
the idea is sound.

39:53.757 --> 39:57.757
Put whatever we have
into circulation among them.

39:57.757 --> 40:00.877
We keep Modesto
from happening again.

40:00.877 --> 40:03.927
Are you suggesting
we kill hedge witches?

40:03.927 --> 40:06.777
I am suggesting
that we keep an eye on them.

40:06.777 --> 40:09.130
To "protect the flame
of knowledge from ever

40:09.131 --> 40:11.881
being extinguished,
no matter the cost."

40:13.927 --> 40:16.677
I don't know what to say.

40:20.737 --> 40:22.777
This is an awesome responsibility.

40:22.797 --> 40:24.837
You and I both know that,
but who is better suited

40:24.857 --> 40:28.737
to bear that responsibility
than The Order?

40:29.947 --> 40:32.857
There is no one I trust
more deeply

40:32.877 --> 40:35.927
to be fair and right than you.

40:42.837 --> 40:44.837
Alice.

40:44.837 --> 40:46.817
I can't stay long.

40:46.817 --> 40:48.817
I-I cast a spell to keep
the Library from eavesdropping,

40:48.837 --> 40:51.777
but it won't last.

40:51.797 --> 40:53.697
I need your help.

40:53.697 --> 40:55.797
They have my friend Sheila.

40:55.797 --> 40:57.817
I know.

40:59.947 --> 41:01.897
Hello, Ms. Quinn.

41:01.897 --> 41:05.947
Alice, please.
Nothing will happen to you here.

41:05.947 --> 41:09.737
Zelda wants to talk.

41:09.757 --> 41:10.817
Why?

41:12.947 --> 41:14.897
I need your help.

41:16.817 --> 41:18.817
I think I've seen enough.

41:18.837 --> 41:23.897
To counteract a lifetime of cis-het
frat-bro bias? I-I doubt it.

41:23.897 --> 41:27.897
Okay. So tell me, what was
I supposed to take from that?

41:27.917 --> 41:30.757
Zelda doesn't know it yet,
but what she just set in motion

41:30.777 --> 41:32.877
is going to change
the Library forever.

41:32.877 --> 41:35.777
Same with Fen and Fillory,

41:35.777 --> 41:38.797
Kady and all of magic.

41:38.817 --> 41:40.817
When you file people away
as sidekicks,

41:40.837 --> 41:43.757
you don't realize
their importance to the story,

41:43.757 --> 41:48.797
and this story belongs to a
lot more people than you think.

41:48.817 --> 41:52.757
Where to shelve a book,
it's not a little thing.

41:52.757 --> 41:58.797
You're telling the world
what to value, who to value.

41:58.817 --> 42:02.917
- You get our responsibility here?
- Well said.

42:02.927 --> 42:05.817
I think you've earned
the right to move up.

42:05.817 --> 42:08.897
Excuse me?

42:08.897 --> 42:12.777
I know so much about you
and your friends,

42:12.797 --> 42:15.857
but you never asked me
how I died.

42:17.667 --> 42:19.667
O-okay, um...

42:19.677 --> 42:22.667
- How did you die?
- Arrow to the chest...

42:22.677 --> 42:24.917
- during the Crusades.
- "The Crusades"?

42:24.927 --> 42:26.927
1,000 years ago?

42:26.947 --> 42:28.817
We really thought the story

42:28.817 --> 42:31.857
was all about white guys
back then, believe me.

42:31.877 --> 42:34.817
And I'm not new at all.

42:34.837 --> 42:38.817
I'm actually
your supervisor's supervisor.

42:38.837 --> 42:41.677
So you're my boss.

42:41.677 --> 42:44.440
I fully see the irony of a
white guy giving you this test,

42:44.441 --> 42:48.697
but ladies upstairs love a twist,
so they always send me.

42:48.697 --> 42:51.817
- Send you to what?
- To promote you.

42:51.837 --> 42:54.677
You're clearly ready
for the next level.

42:54.677 --> 42:55.817
Which is?

42:55.837 --> 42:57.837
Secrets Taken to the Grave.

42:57.857 --> 42:59.897
You're gonna collect them.

42:59.897 --> 43:02.947
Congratulations.

43:03.667 --> 43:04.717
Thank you.

43:04.717 --> 43:06.837
Oh, and, um, I'm afraid
we're gonna need you

43:06.837 --> 43:08.877
to start right away.

43:26.927 --> 43:34.977
Hey. Been a while.
Welcome to the Underworld.
