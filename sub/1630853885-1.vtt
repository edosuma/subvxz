WEBVTT

00:15.891 --> 00:18.435
We begin tonight with Hurricane Katrina
which could be among

00:18.519 --> 00:20.437
the biggest storms
ever to hit this country.

00:20.521 --> 00:23.106
<i>A major hurricane
barreling toward the Gulf Coast.</i>

00:23.190 --> 00:26.193
<i>We are watching
a Category 5 hurricane, Hurricane Katrina.</i>

00:26.276 --> 00:28.904
<i>Hurricane Katrina
is now a Category 5 hurricane.</i>

00:28.987 --> 00:32.241
<i>Right now,
we are emphasizing leaving the city.</i>

00:32.323 --> 00:35.160
<i>Hurricane Katrina has upgraded itself
to a Category 5 hurricane.</i>

00:35.244 --> 00:37.079
We cannot stress enough
the danger this hurricane poses

00:37.162 --> 00:38.163
to Gulf Coast communities.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.123
<i>And this is just the beginning.</i>

00:40.207 --> 00:42.000
<i>The city of New Orleans</i>…

00:42.084 --> 00:44.086
<i>…this time tomorrow
those people who have fled</i>

00:44.169 --> 00:46.296
<i>may have no homes to return to.</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:47.756
<i>…much of New Orleans underwater.</i>

00:47.840 --> 00:48.966
<i>Hurricane Katrina--</i>

00:49.049 --> 00:50.300
<i>Hurricane Katrina--</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:53.178
<i>This is the storm some have long feared.</i>

03:38.594 --> 03:41.680
Holy shit. Jim, we're in the chapel.

03:42.472 --> 03:46.059
<i>Sarah, you gotta come see this now.
Second-floor walkway.</i>

04:11.710 --> 04:13.629
So, Dr. Baltz,

04:13.712 --> 04:17.298
after Hurricane Katrina,
there were 45 dead bodies found

04:17.382 --> 04:19.091
at Memorial Medical Center.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.385
Forty-five.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.055
Yes.

04:23.138 --> 04:28.685
There were five days after the storm.
The most ungodly conditions.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.729
But 45 people died at your hospital.

04:30.812 --> 04:33.982
You're making it sound intentional.
You're mak--

04:34.066 --> 04:35.984
Was it intentional, Doctor?

04:36.068 --> 04:41.114
Please. Please.
You have to understand the circumstances.

04:41.198 --> 04:43.492
Why don't you go back
to the beginning for us, Doctor?

04:43.575 --> 04:45.994
If I understand, Doctor,
there were two hospitals in that building?

04:46.078 --> 04:49.248
Yes, correct. Two hospitals.

04:49.331 --> 04:53.126
There was Memorial Hospital,
where I worked, and LifeCare,

04:53.210 --> 04:56.880
which was a long-term care facility
on the seventh floor.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.800
It had its own staff and patients.

05:00.759 --> 05:04.388
But just ahead of the storm,

05:04.471 --> 05:08.892
we took in an extra 1,200 people.

05:08.976 --> 05:14.606
Look, we have always sheltered people
at our hospital during hurricanes.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.608
That was not unusual.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.735
So, if none of this was unusual…

05:18.819 --> 05:21.655
how did all those patients
die over five days?

05:24.783 --> 05:28.453
Doctor, how did those 45 people die?

05:34.877 --> 05:38.964
<i>Wade in the water</i>

05:41.758 --> 05:46.513
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

05:47.598 --> 05:52.394
<i>Wade in the water</i>

05:52.477 --> 05:57.691
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

05:57.774 --> 06:02.362
<i>Wade in the water</i>

06:02.446 --> 06:07.743
<i>God is gonna trouble these waters</i>

06:07.826 --> 06:11.830
<i>Man went down to the river</i>

06:12.789 --> 06:17.711
<i>Man went down to the river, Lord</i>

06:17.794 --> 06:21.965
<i>Man went down to the river</i>

06:22.799 --> 06:26.470
<i>Went down there for to pray</i>

06:28.096 --> 06:31.934
<i>Wade in the water</i>

06:33.185 --> 06:38.023
<i>Wade in the water, children</i>

06:38.106 --> 06:41.985
<i>Wade in the water</i>

06:42.694 --> 06:47.699
<i>God is gonna trouble these waters</i>

06:52.829 --> 06:58.836
<i>God's gonna trouble these waters</i>

07:06.927 --> 07:10.305
<i>National Guard--
They are now saying that Hurricane Katrina</i>

07:10.389 --> 07:13.392
<i>has upgraded itself
to a Category 5 hurricane.</i>

07:13.976 --> 07:17.145
Just let the folks know
what they have to do

07:17.229 --> 07:18.689
and point them in the right direction.

07:18.772 --> 07:20.816
- I'm sure they will cooperate.
- We have rules for a reason.

07:20.899 --> 07:22.025
Rules for a reason.

07:22.109 --> 07:26.363
Ewing, this is not the first time
this hospital has sheltered people.

07:26.446 --> 07:27.573
You know that.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.993
This is an emergency room.
This isn't a petting zoo.

07:31.076 --> 07:33.871
Come on. These people
are members of our community.

07:33.954 --> 07:35.122
- This is what we do.
- Good.

07:35.205 --> 07:37.040
- Yeah.
- We can take care of them,

07:37.124 --> 07:40.169
and we can appropriately take care of
pets in the basement…

07:40.252 --> 07:42.379
- Well--
-…which is what the rules state.

07:42.462 --> 07:45.257
<i>The Gulf, where actually
it's very warm now.</i>

07:45.340 --> 07:47.634
<i>Between 85 and 90 degrees in some areas.</i>

07:47.718 --> 07:49.553
Okay? We have to take care of them.

07:49.636 --> 07:52.973
We have to take care of these people.
That's what our mission is.

07:53.640 --> 07:57.144
- These animals, they haven't--
- Look, staff meeting in a half an hour.

07:57.227 --> 07:58.437
Anna.

07:58.520 --> 07:59.521
Anna.

07:59.605 --> 08:01.899
Horace, is anybody
in charge of all these people?

08:01.982 --> 08:04.318
Everybody's fine on their own.

08:04.401 --> 08:06.653
I've done this a dozen times.

08:06.737 --> 08:11.158
Sheltering here is like
being snowed in at the airport.

08:11.241 --> 08:15.120
You know, you don't have to be here.
We got plenty of staff.

08:15.204 --> 08:17.581
No, I've got some post-surgery patients
to look after.

08:17.664 --> 08:20.167
Vince can take care of the house.
I wanna be here.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.794
- I'd rather be here than not.
- Understood.

08:23.879 --> 08:26.798
Susan said there's a senior staff
meeting in half an hour, okay?

08:26.882 --> 08:28.133
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.184
Good morning, everybody.

09:19.268 --> 09:20.435
Morning.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.814
Not staying in your office
like the rest of the doctors?

09:23.897 --> 09:25.023
In it together, right?

09:25.107 --> 09:26.525
It's like camping.

09:26.608 --> 09:29.987
We could use a campfire.
I hate it when they crank up the AC.

09:30.696 --> 09:32.197
What's that?

09:34.074 --> 09:35.200
Can opener.

09:35.284 --> 09:40.205
That's all you brought? Some crackers,
tuna fish and a can opener.

09:42.916 --> 09:46.128
Worst comes to worst, I figure we'll be
here three days at the most.

09:46.211 --> 09:47.880
First hurricane at the hospital?

09:47.963 --> 09:49.256
Yes, it is.

09:52.176 --> 09:53.760
Why? Is there a problem?

09:53.844 --> 09:55.220
No, it's just--

09:55.304 --> 09:57.639
It's good you're optimistic. That's all.

09:58.515 --> 10:00.893
Well, how about we just hope
we don't have to find out the hard way

10:00.976 --> 10:02.895
whether it's too much or too little.

10:03.854 --> 10:04.855
Yeah.

10:05.606 --> 10:06.607
Sure.

10:10.903 --> 10:13.155
I'm gonna make some rounds.
I'll see you out there.

10:35.594 --> 10:37.429
Yeah. That's good. Let's go.

10:41.808 --> 10:45.646
Everybody, keep pushing in.
Keep moving in.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.023
- Yes, ma'am.
- Got it. Yep.

10:48.106 --> 10:51.109
Come on, everybody. In.
We could use the body heat, huh?

10:52.986 --> 10:54.279
Everybody hear me?

10:54.363 --> 10:55.447
Yeah.

10:55.531 --> 10:59.243
Okay. So, first off, for those of y'all
who don't know me, I'm Susan Mulderick,

10:59.326 --> 11:01.286
and I'm the incident commander
for this storm.

11:01.370 --> 11:05.541
I know that you all
are dealing with a lot already,

11:05.624 --> 11:09.795
and you're worried about your families,
and you're worried about your loved ones.

11:09.878 --> 11:11.213
I know that we all are.

11:11.296 --> 11:15.843
But regardless of what is going on
outside or inside,

11:15.926 --> 11:18.095
this is still a functioning hospital.

11:18.804 --> 11:22.599
And until this passes, we're gonna be
operating with special protocols.

11:22.683 --> 11:25.269
- Where are my unit liaisons?
- Right here.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.812
Y'all have walkie-talkies?

11:26.895 --> 11:28.522
- Everybody?
- Yes, ma'am.

11:28.605 --> 11:29.690
- Yes.
- Okay.

11:29.773 --> 11:35.279
To be clear for y'all, these liaisons
are in charge of the patient units,

11:35.362 --> 11:39.950
and in case of an emergency in that unit,
you take orders from them.

11:40.033 --> 11:44.788
Any hospital-wide directives
have to come from René or me.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.665
- Or me.
- Or Richard.

11:46.748 --> 11:47.791
Sorry. Sorry.

11:47.875 --> 11:52.713
Richard-- Richard is filling in for Ruben,
who is on vacation.

11:53.505 --> 11:55.257
- Boo!
- Listen.

11:55.340 --> 11:58.385
You ought to be ashamed talking about
your own staff president like that.

11:59.761 --> 12:01.221
Who's on vacation.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.559
Anything from y'all?

12:06.935 --> 12:09.313
People are asking about
the air-conditioning.

12:09.396 --> 12:13.358
Tell them that we turn the temperature
way down for a reason.

12:13.442 --> 12:14.860
If the city power goes out,

12:14.943 --> 12:17.696
our backup generators
don't operate the AC,

12:17.779 --> 12:20.574
and it's gonna get hot as a skillet
in here real quick.

12:20.657 --> 12:24.995
So, as long as it is cold,
they know everything's okay.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.163
Anything else?

12:26.246 --> 12:31.210
Yeah. Susan, have we
talked to someone from LifeCare?

12:31.293 --> 12:35.422
I mean, I know they're their own hospital,
but we are in the same building.

12:36.089 --> 12:39.676
Well, they should have their own
emergency plan, and they're--

12:39.760 --> 12:42.054
you know, they're top dollar,
so if it comes to it,

12:42.137 --> 12:44.097
we'll probably be going
to them for favors.

12:45.390 --> 12:48.310
Anything else? Anybody?

12:48.393 --> 12:51.104
Okay. Well, I have been
at Memorial long enough

12:51.188 --> 12:52.523
- to know that most of these--
- Baptist.

12:52.606 --> 12:58.111
I have been at this hospital long enough
to know that most of these storms,

12:58.195 --> 12:59.404
they just blow on over.

12:59.488 --> 13:03.575
But it is the wasp that you're not
paying attention to that stings ya.

13:03.659 --> 13:05.994
So let's just do
what we are supposed to do.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.665
That's it. Let's go do work!

13:10.832 --> 13:12.584
All right. Great. Thanks. Thanks.

13:14.002 --> 13:16.964
<i>This is a grim situation
for the city of New Orleans.</i>

13:17.881 --> 13:19.675
Did you come over from
LifeCare, Chalmette?

13:19.758 --> 13:21.385
- Yeah.
- Diane Robichaux.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.221
- Gina Isbell.
- How many patients did you bring with you?

13:24.304 --> 13:26.056
- 19.
- Jesus.

13:26.139 --> 13:30.185
Yeah. Well, corporate, you know.
They think Chalmette's gonna get hit hard.

13:30.269 --> 13:33.438
They'd rather evacuate patients from there
over to here at LifeCare, Baptist.

13:33.522 --> 13:34.648
It's "Memorial."

13:34.731 --> 13:36.984
You call the hospital "Baptist,"
you sound like an old-timer.

13:37.067 --> 13:40.028
Well, corporations come and go.

13:40.112 --> 13:43.240
They can call it whatever they want.
To me, it's still Baptist.

13:45.284 --> 13:46.994
Everybody get settled okay?

13:47.077 --> 13:49.746
- Yeah. You know, brought my A-team.
- Good. Good.

13:49.830 --> 13:55.085
There is a patient I wanna keep my eye on.
Emmett Everett. Paraplegic, diabetic.

13:55.169 --> 13:58.213
Got him in a big boy bed now,
but he might need some special care.

13:58.297 --> 14:01.091
- Okay. Anything you need, let us know.
- Okay. Thanks, hon.

14:01.175 --> 14:05.304
<i>It is now a monster.
Category 5, 160-mile-an-hour winds…</i>

14:05.387 --> 14:06.680
Morning, Angela.

14:07.431 --> 14:08.473
Morning, Diane.

14:09.558 --> 14:10.559
Wilda.

14:12.060 --> 14:13.103
Wilda.

14:14.188 --> 14:15.355
How's your mom doing?

14:15.981 --> 14:19.484
Ma, tell Diane how you're doing.

14:20.194 --> 14:21.361
Pretty good.

14:21.445 --> 14:24.406
- Yeah? You good?
- I'm all right.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.699
All right.

14:25.782 --> 14:26.992
Her temperature's down.

14:27.075 --> 14:30.704
That's a good sign.
She's fighting off the infection.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.332
You gonna stay here
with your mom for the storm?

14:33.415 --> 14:34.541
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

14:34.625 --> 14:38.587
Well, I think the kitchen's making food.
You need something, just go get it.

14:38.670 --> 14:39.671
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.967
She is looking better though. Your mom is.

14:46.303 --> 14:48.805
<i>It's not anything like what I expected.</i>

14:48.889 --> 14:52.476
<i>There are people everywhere.
They have their pets with them.</i>

14:53.060 --> 14:56.897
Everything seems just so disorganized.

14:57.856 --> 15:00.234
-<i>Right.</i>
- But everybody acts like it's normal.

15:00.984 --> 15:02.444
<i>Well, I guess it is, right?</i>

15:02.528 --> 15:05.447
<i>I guess it is normal
for people who have done it before.</i>

15:06.657 --> 15:08.033
Yeah.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.284
I got laughed at.

15:09.368 --> 15:11.078
<i>What? You got laughed at, why?</i>

15:11.161 --> 15:13.580
Because I only brought
a six-pack of water and some tuna.

15:13.664 --> 15:16.542
<i>Come on.
You'll only be there a few days most.</i>

15:17.251 --> 15:18.585
That's what I said.

15:19.378 --> 15:20.587
I wish you were here.

15:22.548 --> 15:25.175
<i>I don't just mean in my heart.
I wish you were here.</i>

15:25.259 --> 15:26.426
<i>I wish that you would come.</i>

15:26.510 --> 15:30.472
<i>I know. I know, darling, but
I gotta take care of the house, all right?</i>

15:30.556 --> 15:33.559
The house can take care of itself.
You know?

15:33.642 --> 15:36.854
Because when things get bad,
you know, if they get bad,

15:36.937 --> 15:38.188
I don't wanna have to call you.

15:38.272 --> 15:40.440
I wanna be able to turn around
and see you here.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.571
<i>Okay, look,
I'm going to see you in a day, all right?</i>

15:45.654 --> 15:47.531
Okay. Promise?

15:47.614 --> 15:48.866
<i>Yeah, I promise.</i>

15:51.702 --> 15:53.537
<i>Would you say a prayer for us?</i>

15:53.620 --> 15:56.039
You say it. You know,
I've been saying them all day.

15:58.500 --> 15:59.501
<i>Okay.</i>

16:01.086 --> 16:03.297
<i>All right. God be surrounding you.</i>

16:05.299 --> 16:07.092
<i>You are safe in his arms.</i>

16:09.178 --> 16:10.971
<i>His light will always guide you.</i>

16:14.016 --> 16:15.100
Amen.

16:17.811 --> 16:20.647
<i>Can you do me a favor? Would you
take care of yourself? All right?</i>

16:21.690 --> 16:22.691
Okay.

16:22.774 --> 16:24.443
-<i>I love you.</i>
- I love you too.

16:59.228 --> 17:03.065
Hey! Hey, don't touch that!

17:03.815 --> 17:05.150
You gotta go around!

17:07.109 --> 17:09.988
That's a live wire! Go around!

17:19.164 --> 17:20.207
Shit.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.162
- Power's still on?
- Yeah.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.165
Lines are already coming down.

18:04.334 --> 18:11.008
<i>As a result of that,
I am this morning declaring</i>

18:12.009 --> 18:16.638
<i>that we will be doing a mandatory
evacuation, and I'm gonna read…</i>

18:17.139 --> 18:19.016
Mark, your mom's in the city.

18:20.225 --> 18:23.687
Are they evacuating the hospitals?
Is she gonna be all right?

18:28.108 --> 18:29.109
Mark.

18:31.528 --> 18:32.696
What do we do?

18:50.923 --> 18:53.884
- Mr. Everett.
- Emmett's good, thank you.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.677
Emmett, I'm Diane Robichaux,

18:55.761 --> 18:57.930
one of the administrators
up here at LifeCare.

18:58.013 --> 18:59.389
How you doing?

18:59.473 --> 19:02.142
- Well, I'm all right. How you doing?
- I'm good.

19:02.226 --> 19:04.144
Your trip over from Chalmette
was all right?

19:04.228 --> 19:05.354
It was all right.

19:05.437 --> 19:09.149
You sure? Heard you got a little something
going on with your blood sugar.

19:09.233 --> 19:11.985
Yeah, a little something's been going on,
but I'm good.

19:12.069 --> 19:13.987
You're not sneaking any snacks, are ya?

19:14.071 --> 19:17.324
- Nah, I know better than that.
- I'm just checking.

19:18.450 --> 19:21.495
Today's gonna be a little crazy
with the storm landing.

19:22.037 --> 19:25.123
- You have anybody? Anybody at home?
- My wife.

19:25.207 --> 19:26.667
- What's her name?
- Carrie.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.127
Right, you need someone
to call and check in with her?

19:29.753 --> 19:30.838
I got a phone.

19:30.921 --> 19:33.757
All right. You have trouble
getting through, you let somebody know.

19:33.841 --> 19:35.884
- Thank you.
- You just get some rest.

19:35.968 --> 19:38.512
We'll get you back to Chalmette
just as soon as all this passes.

19:38.595 --> 19:39.638
All right.

20:11.295 --> 20:12.337
Rolfie!

20:13.380 --> 20:15.507
How are you, huh?

20:16.633 --> 20:18.594
Thought you had to
keep the pets downstairs?

20:18.677 --> 20:20.053
Other people do.

20:20.137 --> 20:22.931
- That isn't right.
- You want me to take him back downstairs?

20:23.015 --> 20:24.725
Well, I just want you to be fair.

20:24.808 --> 20:27.686
I'm a doctor, and doctors ought to be able
to bend the rules in their own hospital.

20:27.769 --> 20:29.479
Doctors should set an example.

20:29.563 --> 20:30.898
Fine.

20:32.399 --> 20:35.485
You want me to take him back downstairs?
I'll take him back downstairs.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.112
- Ewing.
- Come on, Rolfie.

20:37.196 --> 20:38.280
Mommy doesn't want you here.

20:38.363 --> 20:41.867
This is like when we were
in that hotel in Atlanta,

20:41.950 --> 20:44.786
and they made us
take the freight elevator with Rolfie,

20:44.870 --> 20:47.372
and you wanted
to be on the people elevator.

20:47.456 --> 20:48.957
That poor woman, she almost--

20:49.041 --> 20:52.002
Well, she just went crazy
from the door opening.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.712
Rolfie was standing--

20:53.795 --> 20:56.507
Ewing! They almost kicked us out--

21:00.719 --> 21:02.596
Yeah. Yeah, hello.

21:03.514 --> 21:04.515
Well…

21:04.598 --> 21:07.935
<i>Potentially catastrophic storm,
Hurricane Katrina.</i>

21:08.018 --> 21:10.729
<i>The US National Hurricane Center
says that Katrina</i>

21:10.812 --> 21:12.940
<i>had made landfall just east of Grand Isle.</i>

21:13.023 --> 21:16.193
<i>That is about 60 miles south
of New Orleans.</i>

21:28.789 --> 21:31.291
<i>The streets are filling with water</i>

21:31.375 --> 21:34.336
<i>that is having trouble draining
into the city's</i>

21:34.419 --> 21:37.005
<i>sewer system and pump system…</i>

21:45.556 --> 21:49.309
I'm fine.
I am just a little bit chilly, yeah.

21:49.393 --> 21:51.687
<i>Well, you keep warm, now.
Are the nurses there?</i>

21:51.770 --> 21:55.107
They're here. Nurses are here,
you know, just like regular. Right.

21:55.190 --> 21:57.693
-<i>Is Jill with you?</i>
- Jill, yes.

21:57.776 --> 21:59.862
Jill's here. Yeah.

21:59.945 --> 22:03.657
Well, that's good.
You stay close to Jill. Okay, Ma?

22:03.740 --> 22:05.158
<i>Listen, Mark.</i>

22:05.242 --> 22:09.329
What I'm really concerned about
is you and Sandra. Now--

22:09.413 --> 22:10.998
<i>How are you doing there?</i>

22:11.081 --> 22:12.708
No, no, we'll be all right.

22:12.791 --> 22:15.711
Now listen, if anything happens,
do what the doctors tell you…

22:16.795 --> 22:17.921
<i>take good care--</i>

22:18.005 --> 22:20.382
Hello. I can't hear you, dear.

22:20.465 --> 22:24.428
- I can't hear you. What?
-<i>Mom? Okay-- They'll take good care--</i>

22:24.511 --> 22:27.389
What's that? I can't hear you.

22:27.472 --> 22:28.473
-<i>Mom?</i>
- Mark?

22:29.558 --> 22:30.559
Mom?

22:31.143 --> 22:32.394
Mark?

22:33.061 --> 22:34.062
Mom!

22:35.439 --> 22:36.815
Mom, you there?

22:38.984 --> 22:40.068
Mark?

22:41.987 --> 22:42.988
Shit.

22:49.912 --> 22:51.246
Is your mom all right?

22:53.665 --> 22:54.875
Lost connection.

23:11.725 --> 23:12.809
Mom.

23:19.149 --> 23:22.152
Hey. I didn't mean to wake you.

23:23.070 --> 23:24.238
Everything okay?

23:25.030 --> 23:26.573
Okay as it can be.

23:32.663 --> 23:34.414
I'm a nursing director.

23:35.374 --> 23:37.793
I didn't expect
to be in charge of all this.

23:38.418 --> 23:39.545
Tired?

23:40.629 --> 23:41.755
I'm all right.

23:56.144 --> 23:57.813
Feels good, Mom.

24:21.670 --> 24:24.089
Diane. Got a problem.

24:36.685 --> 24:39.271
- Mulderick.
-<i>This is Diane Robichaux.</i>

24:39.897 --> 24:43.150
- I'm sorry. Who is this?
- Diane Robichaux up at LifeCare.

24:43.233 --> 24:46.361
We have water leaking through the--
I mean, through the ceiling.

24:46.445 --> 24:47.779
<i>Do you know where it's coming from?</i>

24:47.863 --> 24:50.199
Well, I don't know,
but there's water coming through.

24:50.282 --> 24:51.783
Is everything all right?

24:51.867 --> 24:54.328
<i>I can't tell you what's going on up there.</i>

24:54.411 --> 24:56.747
Well, you're the incident commander
for the hospital, yes?

24:56.830 --> 24:59.625
-<i>Yes.</i>
- So I'm asking, is everything all right?

25:05.839 --> 25:08.926
- Eric. Eric.
- Yeah.

25:09.009 --> 25:11.178
I just got a call
from someone up at LifeCare.

25:11.261 --> 25:13.222
They're saying there's water coming
through the ceiling.

25:13.305 --> 25:15.390
- Water?
- Coming through the ceiling.

25:15.474 --> 25:16.850
LifeCare. That's seventh floor.

25:16.934 --> 25:18.769
Probably rainwater getting blown
into the building.

25:18.852 --> 25:20.854
That's what I thought.
But everything else?

25:20.938 --> 25:24.233
Any other problems?
This building can take these winds.

25:24.316 --> 25:26.026
Been here 80 years. It can take it.

25:26.109 --> 25:29.071
Only thing to worry about,
worst case, is flooding.

25:29.821 --> 25:31.365
Severe flooding.

25:31.448 --> 25:33.784
Okay. If there was severe flooding--

25:33.867 --> 25:36.036
- I mean, what would we do?
- We'd have to evacuate.

25:36.828 --> 25:38.330
Evacuate?

25:39.623 --> 25:40.916
How?

25:40.999 --> 25:42.626
Well, I don't know how.

25:42.709 --> 25:45.003
I mean, you're the incident commander.

26:31.466 --> 26:34.094
I'm not having a very good feeling
about any of this.

26:34.803 --> 26:37.890
I'm concerned about what happens
to the hospital if it's flooded.

26:37.973 --> 26:41.101
If this storm is a Cat 5
like how they keep saying on TV,

26:41.185 --> 26:42.436
even if it's Category 4,

26:42.519 --> 26:45.022
and it pushes a lake,
a river, over a levee--

26:45.105 --> 26:46.815
Hospital sits three feet below sea level.

26:46.899 --> 26:49.568
It's not gonna take much to flood
the basement. Maybe even the first floor.

26:49.651 --> 26:52.362
Well, if we have need to move patients
to the second floor, third--

26:52.446 --> 26:54.406
- We can't move ER patients.
- That's not the only problem.

26:54.489 --> 26:55.699
It's the backup generators.

26:55.782 --> 26:59.494
Parts of the emergency power system
are at ground level. Below ground level.

26:59.578 --> 27:02.080
If the levees were to breach,
if the city power goes--

27:02.164 --> 27:05.209
- If the levees breach. If we lose power.
- We're gonna lose the backup generators,

27:05.292 --> 27:07.377
and we're gonna lose all power
in the hospital.

27:07.461 --> 27:10.589
All power. No equipment, no monitors,
no ventilators, no pumps--

27:10.672 --> 27:11.840
I get it. All means all.

27:11.924 --> 27:14.843
When you say flooding, how much
standing water are we talking about?

27:14.927 --> 27:15.969
Eight feet, ten feet?

27:16.053 --> 27:18.055
Take about four feet
to put us out of business.

27:18.138 --> 27:21.183
And there's already a foot of water--
more than a foot out there right now.

27:25.270 --> 27:29.066
Jesus fucking--
Now is not a good time to be hearing this.

27:29.149 --> 27:31.777
Well, I wrote up a memorandum
after the last hurricane warning you all

27:31.860 --> 27:34.363
about something like this.
I put it in front of the administrators.

27:34.446 --> 27:36.740
- It doesn't do any good to get defensive.
- I'm not getting defensive.

27:36.823 --> 27:39.368
I'm telling y'all that this
isn't the first time this has come up.

27:39.451 --> 27:42.162
All right, fine. So what are our options?

27:42.246 --> 27:46.333
There are no options.
We lose power, we'd have to evacuate.

27:46.416 --> 27:47.918
- Okay.
- It is not okay.

27:48.001 --> 27:51.421
There is no plan for evacuating
the hospital if it's flooded.

27:51.505 --> 27:53.090
What does the emergency manual say?

27:53.173 --> 27:56.301
There is no plan for evacuating
the hospital if it's flooded.

27:56.385 --> 28:00.347
There's a plan for a mass casualty event,
a civil disorder event,

28:00.430 --> 28:03.767
a bomb threat event,
a plan for an active shooter situation.

28:03.851 --> 28:05.561
There's a hundred and something
pages in there

28:05.644 --> 28:08.021
about what to do
in case of a bioterror attack.

28:08.105 --> 28:12.818
There is no plan for an evacuation
if the hospital is flooded.

28:14.736 --> 28:18.448
No, I just reread it. There is nothing
in there about 2,000 people,

28:18.532 --> 28:23.412
200 of them patients, cut off stranded
in a hospital without power.

28:24.162 --> 28:25.330
If the basement floods,

28:25.414 --> 28:29.376
we lose all the food,
the fresh water, all our supplies.

28:29.459 --> 28:33.422
Look, four feet of water,
and we have got problems.

28:35.215 --> 28:36.925
We've got more than problems.

28:38.260 --> 28:39.845
Well, you're the incident commander.

28:39.928 --> 28:41.930
Jesus. Could people stop saying that?

28:42.014 --> 28:44.975
If there's something we should be doing,
it's your call.

29:05.746 --> 29:06.747
Ma.

29:07.497 --> 29:08.498
Ma.

29:11.084 --> 29:15.589
I'm gonna take a little walk.
I'll be right back. Promise.

31:09.369 --> 31:10.579
Yeah.

31:18.795 --> 31:21.757
<i>Wind gusts of about 185 miles per hour.</i>

31:21.840 --> 31:24.510
<i>And winds of up to 150 miles per hour.</i>

31:24.593 --> 31:28.639
<i>It is still expected
to be a formidable menace.</i>

31:28.722 --> 31:32.643
<i>Tornado warnings at this hour expected
for Louisiana, Mississippi,</i>

31:32.726 --> 31:34.561
<i>Alabama and Florida…</i>

31:43.320 --> 31:44.571
<i>In its wake,</i>

31:44.655 --> 31:47.574
<i>there have been winds registering
over 100 miles per hour.</i>

31:47.658 --> 31:50.077
<i>And that's here about four miles inland.</i>

31:50.160 --> 31:52.496
<i>Along the sea,
it's been much worse than that.</i>

31:52.579 --> 31:55.999
<i>We've already got reports
of boats tossed along Interstate 90,</i>

31:56.083 --> 31:58.627
<i>which is about 75 feet away
from the beach.</i>

31:58.710 --> 32:00.420
<i>You can see widespread damage.</i>

32:00.504 --> 32:02.297
<i>There are stoplights down.</i>

32:02.381 --> 32:05.259
<i>The new theaters,
the new restaurants, the new hotels</i>

32:05.342 --> 32:08.637
<i>that have been built in the last
couple years all have been damaged.</i>

33:01.648 --> 33:02.649
You okay?

33:04.318 --> 33:05.444
You all right?

33:11.325 --> 33:12.576
Mr. Hill.

33:13.869 --> 33:15.871
Let's get you back to your room, okay?

33:16.455 --> 33:18.999
- Okay.
- Okay, come.

33:32.179 --> 33:34.431
Okay. Ready?

33:34.515 --> 33:35.516
Yeah.

33:38.727 --> 33:40.729
There we go. All right.

34:39.246 --> 34:41.498
- What's going on?
- I was with a patient. What's happening?

34:41.581 --> 34:42.583
Anna.

34:57.806 --> 34:58.891
Susan.

34:58.974 --> 35:00.893
- Susan, you're bleeding.
- I'm just-- It's fine.

35:00.976 --> 35:02.019
Anna, it's Mulderick.

35:02.102 --> 35:05.147
The walkway's shaking badly.
I don't think it's gonna hold up.

35:05.230 --> 35:06.315
You need to evacuate.

35:06.398 --> 35:08.775
<i>You gotta get out of there,
or you'll be cut off from everything.</i>

35:08.859 --> 35:10.777
Got it. Start going across.

35:10.861 --> 35:12.613
Get everyone off the unit.

35:13.572 --> 35:15.616
We have to evacuate. Get everybody out.

35:15.699 --> 35:17.701
- Okay, let's go! Let's go!
- Across the walkway.

35:17.784 --> 35:19.912
Everybody, across the walkway!

35:19.995 --> 35:22.247
No, no, no. Leave your things.
Leave your things and go.

35:23.790 --> 35:27.294
Eric, the storm's surging.
The water's at three feet.

35:27.377 --> 35:29.004
Copy that. The water's coming in fast.

35:29.087 --> 35:32.299
Come on! Hurry! Hurry!

35:33.300 --> 35:34.384
Go. I'll meet you.

35:34.468 --> 35:37.387
All right, take everybody you can
and move them off the floor. Let's go!

35:38.222 --> 35:40.766
- You too. Let's go.
- Wait. But is everyone off the east side?

35:40.849 --> 35:41.808
I don't know.

35:41.892 --> 35:43.810
- Take her. I'm right behind you.
- Let's go.

35:47.064 --> 35:49.316
Susan. Mulderick, are you there?

35:49.900 --> 35:52.110
- I'm here.
- It's Karen. I'm in ICU.

35:52.194 --> 35:54.571
The windows are breaking
and the floors are filling up with water.

35:54.655 --> 35:56.698
Get everybody you can off the unit.

35:56.782 --> 35:59.451
Okay, we're doing that. But there's--
I got patients. We can't move.

35:59.535 --> 36:01.828
- Do what you can, but you gotta hold on.
- Susan!

36:01.912 --> 36:03.205
- Susan!
- You gotta hold on.

36:03.288 --> 36:05.457
- We got water coming into the basement.
- How much?

36:05.541 --> 36:07.042
It's at three feet outside the building.

36:07.125 --> 36:08.585
We've gotta get everything
outta the basement.

36:08.669 --> 36:10.170
- Food supplies, everything.
- That'll take hours.

36:10.254 --> 36:13.006
We've got 200 doctors and staff.
Get 'em. Get 'em working.

36:13.090 --> 36:14.383
- Food and water first.
- Let's go.

36:14.466 --> 36:15.467
Get to the basement.

36:15.551 --> 36:17.553
Horace… it's Susan.

36:17.636 --> 36:19.638
- I'm here.
- Horace, the basement is flooding.

36:19.721 --> 36:21.390
The first floor might take on water.

36:21.473 --> 36:24.601
I need y'all to start moving the people
from admitting to the second floor,

36:24.685 --> 36:26.144
and I need it done calmly.

36:26.228 --> 36:27.396
Understood.

36:31.191 --> 36:32.734
Bryant. Bryant.

36:34.152 --> 36:39.449
We have to move all these folks
upstairs quickly but very calmly.

36:39.533 --> 36:40.909
- Got it?
- Yeah.

36:40.993 --> 36:42.911
Excuse me. If I could have your attention?

36:42.995 --> 36:45.497
We might be getting some new patients in.

36:45.581 --> 36:48.458
Emergency arrivals. So we're gonna
go ahead and move people upstairs.

36:48.542 --> 36:51.086
Go ahead and grab your things.
Walk upstairs just one floor.

36:51.170 --> 36:52.421
Okay.

36:54.840 --> 36:56.049
Here it comes.

36:59.678 --> 37:01.597
Easy going. We gotta keep it moving.

37:16.153 --> 37:17.863
Anyone else here?

37:19.198 --> 37:20.490
Anyone here?

37:22.326 --> 37:24.244
Anyone else here?

37:45.641 --> 37:47.017
Come on.

37:49.770 --> 37:50.979
Come with me.

37:55.025 --> 37:56.193
Oh, no.

37:57.736 --> 38:01.573
Come on. Come on. Close your eyes.
Okay, close your eyes.

38:01.657 --> 38:02.991
It's gonna be okay.

38:04.284 --> 38:05.577
It's gonna be okay.

38:07.079 --> 38:09.373
<i>Awesome God,
we thank you for your protection.</i>

38:09.456 --> 38:11.208
<i>We need your protection.</i>

38:11.291 --> 38:14.169
<i>Give your divine and protect--
protective shield, Lord.</i>

38:14.253 --> 38:16.463
<i>Thank you. Thank you for your mercy.</i>

38:17.005 --> 38:20.300
<i>Look over Lisa every time she's sleeping.
Thank you.</i>

38:20.384 --> 38:24.847
<i>Give your divine and protect--
protective shield, Lord. Thank you.</i>

38:29.768 --> 38:31.103
<i>God, help us.</i>
