THEOPHANY
(FROM ANCIENT GREEK <i>THEOPHÁNEIA</i>)

00:44.583 --> 00:47.916
NATURAL OR SUPERNATURAL
MANIFESTATION OF GOD

00:50.583 --> 00:54.625
Lord, you that look at us
from your throne in Heaven

00:54.625 --> 00:57.333
and heed our prayers with benevolence.

00:59.541 --> 01:04.625
Adolfo, do you take María de los Dolores
as your lawfully wedded wife

01:04.625 --> 01:07.541
and promise to be faithful to her
for better or for worse,

01:07.541 --> 01:10.625
for richer or for poorer,
in sickness and in health,

01:10.625 --> 01:14.250
to love and to cherish her,
until death do you part?

01:14.791 --> 01:15.750
I do.

01:16.916 --> 01:21.958
María de los Dolores, do you take
Adolfo as your lawfully wedded husband

01:21.958 --> 01:25.708
and promise to be faithful to him
for better or for worse,

01:25.708 --> 01:29.166
for richer or for poorer,
in sickness and in health,

01:29.166 --> 01:32.333
to love and to cherish him,
until death do you part?

01:32.333 --> 01:33.291
I do.

01:43.583 --> 01:45.500
May the Lord in his kindness

01:45.500 --> 01:49.208
strengthen the consent
you have declared before the Church

01:49.208 --> 01:52.000
and bring to fulfillment
his blessings within you.

01:52.708 --> 01:57.000
What God has joined,
let no one put asunder.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.500
Amen.

01:59.500 --> 02:01.250
You may kiss the bride.

02:22.791 --> 02:26.750
SPAIN 1981

02:36.791 --> 02:39.958
Are you ready?
Well, are the three of you ready?

02:39.958 --> 02:41.000
We are.

02:42.708 --> 02:44.458
- Here.
- Thank you.

02:46.500 --> 02:47.666
I think I've got it.

02:49.166 --> 02:50.541
Luis and Marta.

02:51.041 --> 02:52.458
Um, that's too common.

02:52.458 --> 02:54.666
Common? Okay.

02:54.666 --> 02:56.333
Eustaquio and Candelaria.

02:56.333 --> 02:58.750
That's horrible.

02:58.750 --> 03:01.166
I like names that symbolize something.

03:01.166 --> 03:04.041
That symbolize something? Hmm.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.208
What about Adam and Eve then?

03:08.250 --> 03:09.416
Don't be silly.

03:10.625 --> 03:12.750
You're gonna be the best mom in the world.

03:19.291 --> 03:21.083
Long live the newlyweds!

03:23.500 --> 03:25.166
Careful! Careful!

03:25.750 --> 03:27.875
Oh! Watch out! Be careful!

03:34.083 --> 03:35.166
What's wrong?

03:40.166 --> 03:41.833
<i>Don't move!</i>

03:42.333 --> 03:43.583
<i>Silence!</i>

03:52.500 --> 03:53.333
<i>Silence!</i>

03:53.333 --> 03:55.875
<i>Yesterday,
at 6:26 in the evening,</i>

03:55.875 --> 03:59.541
<i>took place the most dramatic episode
in the history of our country,</i>

03:59.541 --> 04:01.541
<i>since the beginning of democracy.</i>

04:19.458 --> 04:21.125
Adolfo, what happened?

04:23.625 --> 04:25.750
There were some complications.

04:26.916 --> 04:28.000
I'm really sorry.

04:29.208 --> 04:31.416
No. No.

04:31.416 --> 04:33.666
I must inform you

04:34.291 --> 04:36.541
that you suffered internal damage.

04:37.333 --> 04:38.208
Quite severe.

04:38.208 --> 04:39.833
What?

04:42.041 --> 04:44.041
I'm afraid you'll never be able
to bear children.

04:44.041 --> 04:47.041
Oh, no! No! No!

04:47.041 --> 04:50.166
I'm really sorry.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.333
Why me?

05:04.875 --> 05:06.291
- Hey.
- Why me?

05:06.291 --> 05:07.250
Hey.

05:43.625 --> 05:46.250
<i>Through my fault.
Through my fault.</i>

05:46.250 --> 05:48.666
<i>Through my most grievous fault.</i>

06:00.958 --> 06:02.583
<i>Amen.</i>

06:53.083 --> 06:55.708
Lola, you look like a ghost.
Look at you.

06:56.500 --> 06:58.083
It's been six months already.

06:59.666 --> 07:01.333
I need you to be well.

07:03.000 --> 07:05.041
I'm willing to do anything for you.

07:05.541 --> 07:06.541
Anything.

07:12.541 --> 07:15.208
- Why don't we go back to our town?
- No, that's out of the question.

07:15.208 --> 07:17.875
- But this house--
- The house isn't the problem here.

07:20.166 --> 07:22.458
I had a wonderful childhood in this house.

07:25.000 --> 07:27.083
And our children will be happy here too.

07:33.666 --> 07:34.583
Honey.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.166
There's a convent nearby.

07:39.666 --> 07:41.875
It's an orphanage.
There are children there.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.500
- Maybe we could go--
- Mm-mm.

07:46.666 --> 07:48.666
We'll love them
as if they were our very own.

07:48.666 --> 07:50.083
- No. No.
- Listen, honey.

07:50.083 --> 07:51.583
One nail drives out another.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.916
Please go.

08:09.666 --> 08:10.625
Lola...

08:11.666 --> 08:13.083
I can't go on like this.

08:14.250 --> 08:15.291
I just can't.

08:25.666 --> 08:28.041
TVE PRESENTS

08:28.041 --> 08:30.541
EVERY THURSDAY FROM 7 TO 8

09:05.000 --> 09:07.500
This country is out of control.

09:08.083 --> 09:11.500
Young people these days
lack essential values.

09:11.500 --> 09:13.083
They're completely lost.

09:13.083 --> 09:15.041
Reverend Mother.

09:18.125 --> 09:19.375
Are you all right?

09:20.833 --> 09:21.750
Mm.

09:21.750 --> 09:23.416
My wife grew up in a convent.

09:23.416 --> 09:24.750
Mm?

09:25.708 --> 09:28.291
This sacred place was built
in the 15th century

09:28.291 --> 09:29.875
after the birth of Christ.

09:30.458 --> 09:35.958
You could say that our lifestyle
and doctrine are definitely old-school.

09:38.333 --> 09:42.791
Here we provide shelter
and education to abandoned children.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.500
Children from unwed mothers...

09:46.875 --> 09:48.041
...prostitutes,

09:48.708 --> 09:53.000
children with physical disabilities,
with mental impairments.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.541
Yeah.

09:56.625 --> 10:00.416
We were looking
to adopt preferably two babies, but--

10:00.416 --> 10:02.583
Without impairments, of course.

10:02.583 --> 10:07.541
In that case, I'd ask for your donation
to the convent to be quite generous.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.291
How long
for the paperwork to be processed?

10:25.250 --> 10:26.375
Mmm.

10:27.833 --> 10:30.708
That'll be sorted out
as soon as we receive your donation.

10:30.708 --> 10:31.916
I have it here.

10:31.916 --> 10:33.125
Hmm.

10:34.708 --> 10:36.166
Where is your wife?

10:55.875 --> 10:58.166
Heavenly music,
don't you think?

11:00.875 --> 11:02.750
They play like angels.

11:04.416 --> 11:06.458
And they're only seven years old.

11:08.958 --> 11:12.916
- This is being played by children?
- Honey, everything's been taken care of.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.291
I'd like to meet them.

11:19.875 --> 11:21.041
Tin, Tina!

11:23.750 --> 11:24.791
Come here, please!

11:25.833 --> 11:28.750
They were abandoned
at the gates of the convent.

11:28.750 --> 11:30.458
They were just a few weeks old.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.625
They are...

11:34.875 --> 11:36.875
unique, special children.

11:36.875 --> 11:40.708
Sure. But Tin and Tina,
these aren't Spanish names, are they?

11:40.708 --> 11:41.666
No.

11:41.666 --> 11:44.041
They were named after Saint Augustine,

11:44.541 --> 11:46.041
patron saint of our order.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.708
Children.

11:57.708 --> 12:02.291
This is Mr. Adolfo and, uh... his wife.

12:02.291 --> 12:03.333
Lola.

12:04.625 --> 12:06.250
- Hello.
- Hello.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.541
Hello.

12:07.541 --> 12:09.583
You play the organ beautifully.

12:09.583 --> 12:11.458
We practice every day.

12:13.583 --> 12:16.708
The wrath of God!
It's the wrath of God!

12:17.916 --> 12:19.875
It's just a storm, don't worry.

12:19.875 --> 12:20.875
Lola.

12:21.458 --> 12:22.958
We need to focus, okay?

12:23.708 --> 12:25.875
Children, you can go back to playing.

12:28.416 --> 12:30.208
Don't go away, please. Stay.

12:30.208 --> 12:32.791
Yes, please, don't go. Stay here with us.

12:32.791 --> 12:35.041
We can play
lots of other things, you know.

12:37.833 --> 12:39.000
I would love to.

12:41.125 --> 12:42.250
But I can't.

12:47.250 --> 12:49.541
Tin, come on, don't be sad.

12:49.541 --> 12:52.875
I told you that nobody loves us.

12:57.583 --> 12:58.625
Just a second.

13:00.000 --> 13:02.875
Lola,
no, no, no, please listen.

13:02.875 --> 13:05.833
I know what you're thinking,
and they're just too old.

13:05.833 --> 13:07.208
And a bit strange.

13:08.416 --> 13:10.458
These children need to be loved, Adolfo.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.750
Same as us, we need love.

13:14.541 --> 13:16.208
So let's give each other love.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.208
Let us be a family.

13:21.916 --> 13:23.125
Are you sure about them?

13:40.666 --> 13:41.916
Don't you like the music?

13:41.916 --> 13:43.333
That music is satanic.

13:45.833 --> 13:47.291
Oh, well then...

13:49.333 --> 13:50.791
Why don't you sing us a song then?

13:51.750 --> 13:52.916
Yes, let's sing a song!

13:52.916 --> 13:54.333
Okay, what song shall we sing?

13:54.333 --> 13:57.041
Come on, I'm sure you know many songs.

13:58.250 --> 13:59.291
Mm-hmm.

14:23.541 --> 14:25.583
That's very, very nice, you two.

14:25.583 --> 14:29.291
That's a very nice song.

14:39.458 --> 14:41.666
How is my boy?

14:41.666 --> 14:42.750
Children.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.750
This is Kuki.

14:45.916 --> 14:47.333
You want to say hello?

14:49.208 --> 14:51.000
- Whoa!
- Tina! Tina!

14:51.000 --> 14:53.125
- Kuki.
- What's wrong? You afraid?

14:53.833 --> 14:54.833
Kuki, stop!

14:55.791 --> 14:57.708
Come on. He's a very good dog.

14:57.708 --> 14:58.666
His name is Kuki,

14:58.666 --> 15:00.625
and you'll have to help us
take care of him.

15:00.625 --> 15:03.708
That's enough. It's all right.

15:08.583 --> 15:10.875
Look! Daddy pilots one of those.

15:11.666 --> 15:12.500
Really?

15:12.500 --> 15:14.166
- Yeah.
- So cool!

15:15.208 --> 15:17.500
Up in the sky, have you seen God?

15:18.000 --> 15:19.666
Haven't had the pleasure
of meeting him yet.

15:21.416 --> 15:22.916
The drive didn't take long.

15:22.916 --> 15:25.250
Not at all. The convent is very close.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.708
How close is it?

15:26.708 --> 15:28.958
About 15 kilometers away.

15:28.958 --> 15:30.375
And on foot?

15:30.375 --> 15:31.750
Uh, on foot?

15:31.750 --> 15:34.750
Through the woods,
it would be, uh... six kilometers.

15:34.750 --> 15:37.791
But it would take a long time.
Why do you want to know?

15:40.500 --> 15:41.541
Mm.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.791
Come on.

15:45.541 --> 15:47.916
Wow!

15:47.916 --> 15:50.291
So cool!

15:50.291 --> 15:51.666
It's so cool.

15:51.666 --> 15:53.041
Totally.

15:54.416 --> 15:56.291
- Let's explore the house.
- Okay!

16:04.208 --> 16:06.916
You'd think there was a dead body in here.

16:06.916 --> 16:08.541
Honey.

16:11.041 --> 16:13.625
It's been so long
since I've seen you smile.

16:19.583 --> 16:20.708
Children.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.083
Children.

16:29.666 --> 16:30.666
Children.

16:32.583 --> 16:34.791
Children!

16:37.583 --> 16:39.041
What's wrong, Mommy?

16:40.958 --> 16:41.958
Nothing.

16:43.541 --> 16:45.916
Mommy, did we do something wrong?

16:47.541 --> 16:48.416
No.

16:50.166 --> 16:52.291
It's just that this room isn't yours.

16:53.291 --> 16:55.000
It's the one down the hall.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.750
Come on, Tina! Let's go see it!

17:02.791 --> 17:05.708
And those ones?
Are they from another plane trip?

17:05.708 --> 17:08.125
Those are from China,
a country far away.

17:08.125 --> 17:12.583
- If you want, I can show you pictures.
- And that? Is it from another trip?

17:14.208 --> 17:18.333
No, this is a, uh, a TV.
You've never seen one?

17:19.125 --> 17:20.958
Mm-mm.

17:22.333 --> 17:23.458
Okay.

17:24.708 --> 17:26.083
Dinner's ready.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.500
All right. Where are you going?

17:29.791 --> 17:32.166
- Let's see how it turned out.
- I'm sure it'll be great.

17:33.416 --> 17:34.625
Let's see.

17:41.333 --> 17:44.583
Tin and I wanted to thank you
for adopting us as your children.

17:46.416 --> 17:47.708
Close your eyes, please.

17:48.666 --> 17:49.791
Okay.

17:55.583 --> 17:56.708
Open them.

17:58.708 --> 18:00.583
This is the crown of Christ,

18:00.583 --> 18:02.958
so that you may free us
from the curse of sin.

18:04.583 --> 18:05.708
Thank you. It's nice.

18:05.708 --> 18:08.916
Now you, Mommy.
I want you to close your eyes.

18:08.916 --> 18:10.791
All right.

18:14.333 --> 18:16.458
Let me put this on.

18:17.791 --> 18:18.708
Now.

18:20.291 --> 18:22.583
This is the Holy Rosary,

18:22.583 --> 18:26.916
so that you, like Mary, can meditate
about the mysteries of our faith.

18:26.916 --> 18:29.791
If you wear it,
it'll protect you from evil.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.541
Come on, the king is hungry.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.791
Honey, I've seriously missed your omelets.

18:49.625 --> 18:51.333
Come on, it'll get cold.

18:54.750 --> 18:55.916
What's wrong?

18:58.833 --> 19:00.041
Why aren't you eating?

19:00.625 --> 19:02.833
Well, you didn't say grace.

19:04.875 --> 19:06.291
How could I forget?

19:07.333 --> 19:09.708
Come on. Let's all say grace, all right?

19:20.625 --> 19:24.250
Oh Lord, we give you thanks for this day
and for this food we are about to eat.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.000
May it serve to fulfill your will.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.500
In the name
of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.041
- Amen.
- Amen.

19:35.333 --> 19:37.000
All right. Let's dig in.

19:38.458 --> 19:40.666
Mmm. This is delicious.

19:49.875 --> 19:50.750
Mommy?

19:51.833 --> 19:52.708
Yes?

19:53.291 --> 19:54.833
Why did you adopt us?

19:57.083 --> 19:58.458
Because we wanted to.

19:58.958 --> 20:00.250
Yes, but...

20:00.916 --> 20:03.166
why don't you have children of your own?

20:06.458 --> 20:07.708
Because it's impossible.

20:10.375 --> 20:13.916
Everything's possible, Mommy.
Miracles happen every day.

20:21.125 --> 20:22.708
Why did you bring all this?

20:23.500 --> 20:27.458
So that the, uh, the exterminating angel
can't come into this house.

20:30.750 --> 20:32.375
Exterminating angel?

21:50.625 --> 21:51.958
Good morning, Mommy.

21:52.708 --> 21:54.250
Good morning, Mommy.

21:54.250 --> 21:57.333
Good morning. You can sit down.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.291
Shouldn't we wait for Daddy?

22:06.000 --> 22:08.958
No, Dad woke up
very early to get to work.

22:10.666 --> 22:12.208
Come on, let's have breakfast.

22:21.958 --> 22:23.958
You don't say grace before breakfast?

22:26.875 --> 22:28.791
No, I'm not going to say grace.

22:28.791 --> 22:30.416
You don't believe in God, right?

22:38.416 --> 22:40.375
Sometimes it's hard to believe.

22:42.791 --> 22:46.833
"The fool says in his heart,
'Liar, there is no God.'"

22:47.458 --> 22:48.583
I know that one.

22:49.166 --> 22:51.625
Psalm, uh...

22:51.625 --> 22:53.125
seven?

22:53.125 --> 22:55.708
- It's Psalm 14, silly.
- Aw, nuts.

22:58.083 --> 23:00.375
You know,
we have a way of seeing God.

23:00.375 --> 23:01.666
You want to know how?

23:02.791 --> 23:03.708
Sure.

23:04.583 --> 23:07.833
But you have to promise
that no matter what happens,

23:07.833 --> 23:09.958
you won't get up from your chair.

23:09.958 --> 23:11.291
Do you promise?

23:12.500 --> 23:14.000
Yes, I promise.

23:15.416 --> 23:17.250
I really want to see God.

23:17.250 --> 23:21.166
I'd like to ask him something.
Please, pretty please.

23:21.166 --> 23:23.541
Okay.

23:40.666 --> 23:42.166
Tina, what are you doing?

23:44.166 --> 23:46.041
Psst. You promised.

24:00.666 --> 24:02.041
Are you okay?

24:02.625 --> 24:05.166
I asked for a miracle for you.

24:05.166 --> 24:06.666
I'm sure He will grant it.

24:10.708 --> 24:14.083
"Let us all seek God.
Have faith and no doubt."

24:14.083 --> 24:17.625
"If you believe, you will receive
whatever you ask for in prayer."

24:17.625 --> 24:19.375
I know that one.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.666
Matthew ten...

24:26.000 --> 24:27.958
- Food fight!
- Guys, you can't do that!

24:27.958 --> 24:29.250
Gotcha!

24:29.250 --> 24:30.375
Take that!

24:39.458 --> 24:40.916
Who did that?

24:49.625 --> 24:51.291
EL POZÓN SCHOOL

24:51.291 --> 24:54.708
As you can see,
inside the rib cage

24:54.708 --> 24:57.375
we can find the two lungs

24:57.375 --> 25:00.833
which contract and expand
every time we breathe.

25:00.833 --> 25:02.500
And if we remove them,

25:02.500 --> 25:07.291
we discover the most important organ
in the human body...

25:07.291 --> 25:08.416
The schlong!

25:10.041 --> 25:12.041
Kids. Hey, kids, kids, please!

25:12.750 --> 25:13.625
Pedro.

25:13.625 --> 25:15.083
Hey, listen to me.

25:15.958 --> 25:18.875
One more stupid joke, you're out.

25:18.875 --> 25:20.625
Got it, Mr. Julián.

25:21.208 --> 25:22.833
No more jokes, I promise.

25:31.625 --> 25:33.125
Good morning, Mr. Julián.

25:33.125 --> 25:35.625
Good morning. Good morning. Come on in.

25:35.625 --> 25:39.750
Hey, everybody, that's enough.
Please be quiet.

25:40.333 --> 25:42.958
We have two new students joining us today.

25:43.708 --> 25:47.208
Now, this is Tin and this here is Tina.

25:49.291 --> 25:51.583
Hey, I know those two.

25:56.250 --> 25:59.708
You're the children of Count Dracula!

26:01.791 --> 26:04.375
Pedro! Hey! Everybody, quiet!

26:06.000 --> 26:07.041
THE HOLY TRINITY

26:07.041 --> 26:11.666
"Ezekiel,
Prophecy against Philistia 25:16."

26:12.500 --> 26:14.166
You're very good at this, Mommy.

26:15.333 --> 26:18.041
Here, you try. But be careful.

26:20.666 --> 26:21.500
Here.

26:21.500 --> 26:24.708
"I will carry out great vengeance
and punish them in my wrath."

26:25.208 --> 26:28.458
"Then they will know that I am the Lord,
when I take vengeance on them."

26:28.458 --> 26:30.041
You're really good at this.

26:32.041 --> 26:35.458
Mommy, are we the children of Dracula?

26:36.625 --> 26:38.125
You know who Dracula is?

26:39.208 --> 26:41.583
Why aren't we like everyone else?

26:41.583 --> 26:43.625
Why did God make us so strange?

26:47.791 --> 26:49.125
You want me to show you a secret?

26:49.750 --> 26:50.666
Okay.

26:56.333 --> 26:57.250
Mm-hmm.

27:00.208 --> 27:02.291
Part of your leg is fake?

27:02.291 --> 27:03.375
Uh-huh.

27:05.791 --> 27:07.291
See, I'm strange too.

27:08.833 --> 27:10.125
What happened to you?

27:14.041 --> 27:15.708
When I was your age...

27:18.291 --> 27:20.500
my parents used to go from town to town,

27:21.166 --> 27:22.750
and they would show movies.

27:24.291 --> 27:25.875
We lived in a camper van.

27:31.583 --> 27:32.583
One night,

27:33.916 --> 27:36.041
I woke up, and my leg was on fire.

27:40.291 --> 27:42.041
There was fire everywhere.

27:46.500 --> 27:49.208
I was able to escape, save myself.

27:52.583 --> 27:54.125
But my parents didn't.

27:56.083 --> 27:58.916
It was God, Mommy. God saved you.

27:59.833 --> 28:02.958
- Is anyone home?
- Daddy!

28:43.666 --> 28:46.458
Did you nail
all those crucifixes over the doors?

28:47.458 --> 28:48.708
I thought that was you.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.375
- It was the children.
- So what? Who cares?

28:52.375 --> 28:54.500
If it matters to them, just leave them be.

28:55.333 --> 28:57.416
They're totally obsessed with religion.

28:57.958 --> 29:00.666
- They spend all day talking about God.
- That's normal.

29:01.500 --> 29:04.916
They were raised by nuns.
It'd be weird if they were into football.

29:06.375 --> 29:07.250
True.

29:17.333 --> 29:18.916
Do you believe God exists?

29:20.000 --> 29:21.208
Seriously?

29:25.250 --> 29:27.333
I think that there are two options.

29:28.833 --> 29:33.666
Either we believe there's
a... an omnipotent and mysterious God

29:34.250 --> 29:36.958
and that you and I will be reunited
in our next life, or--

29:36.958 --> 29:38.500
Or God doesn't exist.

29:39.625 --> 29:42.541
And we made all that up
so we wouldn't feel so alone.

29:46.166 --> 29:47.541
And nothing makes sense.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.125
And that's why I think...

29:55.583 --> 29:57.708
we shouldn't leave to the next life

29:58.375 --> 30:00.083
what we can enjoy in this one.

30:01.916 --> 30:04.041
Hey, stop! The kids might see us!

30:05.208 --> 30:07.125
You're starting to sound
a lot like a mother.

30:07.125 --> 30:08.958
You're an idiot.

30:19.458 --> 30:22.375
I said
it was going to happen, didn't I?

30:24.583 --> 30:26.000
Hey, what's going on?

30:26.875 --> 30:28.166
Why aren't you asleep?

30:28.791 --> 30:30.208
We don't feel sleepy.

30:30.875 --> 30:32.958
Can we play battle of the angels?

30:32.958 --> 30:36.250
Yes, let's play battle of the angels
and then we'll go to sleep.

30:37.250 --> 30:39.791
Please. Pretty please.

30:41.166 --> 30:43.750
Fine. How do you play it?

30:43.750 --> 30:44.958
It's very easy.

30:45.625 --> 30:48.833
You close your eyes,
and then we recite a verse from the Bible.

30:48.833 --> 30:52.250
- Mm-hmm.
- When we're finished, you count to three.

30:52.250 --> 30:54.375
You open your eyes and look for us.

30:55.250 --> 30:56.291
That's it?

30:58.583 --> 30:59.916
What do I have to do?

30:59.916 --> 31:01.208
Get up on your feet.

31:07.833 --> 31:10.833
Revelation, chapter 12,
verses seven and nine.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.291
"And there was a war in Heaven."

31:13.291 --> 31:17.000
"Michael and his angels
fought against the great dragon."

31:17.583 --> 31:21.125
"The great dragon,
that serpent most ancient,

31:21.125 --> 31:24.208
also known as the Devil and Lucifer,

31:24.833 --> 31:27.666
the one who leads the whole world astray."

31:32.125 --> 31:33.041
Ready?

31:36.083 --> 31:37.125
One...

31:39.375 --> 31:40.291
...two...

31:41.125 --> 31:45.291
And three!
Be gone, Satan! This is our Heaven!

31:45.291 --> 31:46.541
Get out!

32:18.791 --> 32:21.750
Children, is this another game?

32:22.791 --> 32:24.000
Where are you?

32:26.000 --> 32:27.416
Hey, where did you go?

32:34.000 --> 32:35.916
Come on, Tin, hold on tight!

32:35.916 --> 32:37.625
Mom, ask him something!

32:49.125 --> 32:50.166
Let go!

32:50.833 --> 32:52.625
I told you to hold tight!

32:54.500 --> 32:56.166
Mommy, you can almost see him!

32:57.125 --> 32:58.125
There he is!

32:59.291 --> 33:00.291
There he is!

33:36.041 --> 33:37.041
Feel better?

33:37.916 --> 33:38.833
Yes.

33:39.958 --> 33:45.250
Lola, a proper punishment will put a stop
to this nonsense once and for all.

33:45.250 --> 33:46.500
They're just kids.

33:48.125 --> 33:50.291
They like to play, like all kids do.

33:53.166 --> 33:55.625
They just need
some time to adjust, that's all.

33:56.666 --> 33:58.041
Tin and Tina!

34:06.750 --> 34:08.833
Shhh. It's okay.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.250
We're really sorry, Mom.

34:21.791 --> 34:25.916
If we've done something bad to you,
we deserve to be punished.

34:29.083 --> 34:30.416
Kuki! Enough!

34:35.000 --> 34:37.583
In the convent,
they used to beat us with sticks.

34:38.166 --> 34:41.333
And one time, we committed a very big sin,

34:42.541 --> 34:44.250
and they cut off our hair.

34:45.708 --> 34:46.708
Shhh.

34:46.708 --> 34:49.375
Without punishment, there's no salvation.

34:50.208 --> 34:52.458
We're not going to punish you, all right?

34:53.583 --> 34:54.583
Kuki!

35:01.666 --> 35:03.083
Are you okay, Mommy?

35:18.208 --> 35:19.875
<i>You take a few steps back,</i>

35:19.875 --> 35:23.000
and when you let go,
you have to put your feet up.

35:23.000 --> 35:24.291
Like this. See?

35:26.708 --> 35:28.458
Come on, it's super easy.

35:30.750 --> 35:32.333
Don't be such a chicken.

35:32.333 --> 35:33.583
I'm not a chicken.

35:33.583 --> 35:35.208
Well, do it, then.

35:35.208 --> 35:39.250
Well, well!
If it isn't the little Draculas!

35:40.833 --> 35:43.625
Wow! Nice hats you've got there.

35:43.625 --> 35:46.875
I bet they match the coffins
you sleep in very well.

35:49.166 --> 35:51.875
We don't sleep in coffins. That's a lie.

35:51.875 --> 35:53.458
Are you sure?

35:53.458 --> 35:55.500
Mm. Mm.

35:56.041 --> 35:57.750
What are you doing?

35:57.750 --> 35:59.291
Wait, no!

35:59.291 --> 36:01.416
What-- What are you doing? No! No!

36:01.416 --> 36:04.958
- No, please! No!
- Hey, don't do that!

36:04.958 --> 36:06.000
- No!
- Let go of me!

36:06.000 --> 36:08.041
- Fly, Dracula!
- Stop!

36:08.041 --> 36:10.666
- Higher!
- No, stop it!

36:10.666 --> 36:13.500
- Fly!
- Stop! Stop!

36:18.166 --> 36:20.875
MY FAVORITE HORRORS

36:20.875 --> 36:22.541
Shh.

36:22.541 --> 36:26.791
<i>...he used to drink
the blood of his victims. That's why...</i>

36:26.791 --> 36:27.708
Shh.

36:27.708 --> 36:32.083
<i>...people started calling him "Draculis,"
which means dragon or devil,</i>

36:32.083 --> 36:35.833
<i>or more specifically, son of the Devil.</i>

36:36.583 --> 36:38.250
- Daddy.
- Yes, that's me.

36:39.916 --> 36:42.083
- Can we watch the movie, please?
- No.

36:42.083 --> 36:43.625
We can't, it's a scary movie.

36:43.625 --> 36:45.041
What do you mean, you can't?

36:45.041 --> 36:46.833
- Of course you can. Right, hon?
- Really?

36:46.833 --> 36:49.125
- It's just that we're both very tired.
- You sure?

36:49.125 --> 36:50.750
- So we're going to bed now.
- Yes, very.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.875
Have fun, you two. Good night.

36:53.625 --> 36:57.666
Good night.

36:57.666 --> 37:02.250
<i>From that,
Bram Stoker created Dracula...</i>

37:02.250 --> 37:03.791
- Cool, isn't it?
- Mm.

37:03.791 --> 37:05.291
<i>...still popular today.</i>

37:14.541 --> 37:16.125
Turn down the volume, please.

37:36.083 --> 37:39.625
Rock, paper, scissors.

37:41.875 --> 37:43.000
All right, your turn.

38:00.958 --> 38:04.166
Holy Mary, Mother of God,

38:04.166 --> 38:06.166
pray for us sinners,

38:06.166 --> 38:09.166
now and at the hour of our death.

38:09.666 --> 38:10.500
Amen.

38:31.250 --> 38:34.833
- Should I give him more?
- Yes. That'll make him sleep better.

38:37.208 --> 38:38.250
Your turn.

38:52.000 --> 38:54.125
Hurry up, Tin! They'll see us!

38:56.375 --> 38:58.375
Scaredy-cat.

39:05.833 --> 39:06.958
Here you go, boy.

39:10.958 --> 39:12.541
Here's some yummy food.

39:23.166 --> 39:24.583
I can't.

39:24.583 --> 39:26.166
A little bit more.

39:36.166 --> 39:37.291
Right here.

39:51.500 --> 39:54.208
Come on, Tin.
We don't have very much time.

40:05.708 --> 40:06.875
Mmm...

40:08.208 --> 40:09.125
This one.

40:10.333 --> 40:11.500
That's too small.

40:12.166 --> 40:13.541
Let's take...

40:14.458 --> 40:15.458
this one.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.916
But I like this one more.

40:21.000 --> 40:22.291
You take this one.

40:23.125 --> 40:26.250
And... and take this thing also.

40:45.166 --> 40:46.708
Did you do it yet?

40:47.625 --> 40:49.291
No, I'm scared.

40:52.208 --> 40:55.625
Look.
You have to do it right... here.

40:55.625 --> 40:56.708
But I can't.

40:57.375 --> 40:59.000
Do it hard, Tin, hard.

41:09.375 --> 41:11.625
You've got blood
all over your face.

41:12.125 --> 41:13.666
You look like a vampire.

41:13.666 --> 41:17.208
And you...
you look like a circus clown.

41:19.583 --> 41:20.958
Take that.

41:20.958 --> 41:22.041
You'll see.

41:25.666 --> 41:27.375
Come on, Tin. Stop it.

41:28.916 --> 41:30.041
Here, I'll help you.

41:30.541 --> 41:32.166
It's like cutting up a steak.

41:33.375 --> 41:35.625
Like this.

41:35.625 --> 41:37.791
Now stick your hand in and pull it out.

41:41.958 --> 41:43.166
What's it like?

41:44.250 --> 41:46.666
It's... squishy.

41:47.166 --> 41:48.500
Like a sponge?

41:49.166 --> 41:50.250
No.

41:50.250 --> 41:54.041
Squishy... like a snail.

41:54.041 --> 41:58.250
Like a snail?
You're such a ninny.

42:04.416 --> 42:07.416
Psalm 51, verses one and two.

42:08.583 --> 42:10.916
"Have mercy on me, O God...

42:10.916 --> 42:12.791
...according to your unfailing love,

42:12.791 --> 42:15.041
according to your great compassion

42:15.041 --> 42:16.958
blot out my transgressions."

42:17.458 --> 42:19.458
"Wash away all my iniquity

42:19.458 --> 42:21.291
and cleanse me from my sin."

42:24.083 --> 42:25.125
Put it back in.

42:26.500 --> 42:28.083
Careful.

42:44.416 --> 42:46.625
- You're good at sewing.
- Thank you.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.291
You'll see. Mommy will be so happy
when she wakes up.

42:57.541 --> 43:00.166
All done. Now we just have to wait.

43:00.791 --> 43:03.833
Waiting is so boring.
What will we do until she wakes up?

43:04.958 --> 43:09.166
We can... do like everybody else, watch TV.

43:13.791 --> 43:16.041
<i>People don't believe
in anything these days.</i>

43:16.041 --> 43:18.291
<i>They don't even believe in illusionists.</i>

43:18.791 --> 43:22.291
<i>Well, I'll give you some time
to think about that statement.</i>

43:22.291 --> 43:24.000
<i>And we'll be back shortly.</i>

43:44.125 --> 43:46.458
- What's wrong, honey?
- Oh, nothing.

43:47.083 --> 43:50.000
Nothing. It's just the kids.
They've been playing with the jam again.

43:52.458 --> 43:54.041
Honey, that's not jam.

43:57.208 --> 43:58.791
Kuki's not waking up.

44:09.916 --> 44:11.625
Mm.

44:17.791 --> 44:19.000
What have you done?

44:19.791 --> 44:24.291
Kuki behaved very badly with Mommy.
And so we washed him.

44:24.291 --> 44:26.041
What do you mean, you washed him?

44:27.541 --> 44:29.000
We cleansed his soul.

44:29.500 --> 44:31.166
We washed away his sins.

44:31.166 --> 44:34.000
We wanted to honor you, Mommy.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.583
We wanted you to be proud of us.

44:39.416 --> 44:41.250
Why isn't he waking up?

44:43.166 --> 44:44.458
Because he's dead.

44:47.125 --> 44:48.000
Dead?

44:48.500 --> 44:50.750
Is it our fault? Did we kill him?

44:52.458 --> 44:57.833
No!
No! No! No! No! No! No!

45:03.250 --> 45:05.375
It's all right. It's all right. It's okay.

45:07.208 --> 45:08.625
It was an accident.

45:49.666 --> 45:50.875
God, it stinks.

46:10.750 --> 46:11.958
You feeling any better?

46:13.000 --> 46:15.958
What if they decide to cut you
or me open to cleanse our souls?

46:15.958 --> 46:17.833
Lola.

46:18.708 --> 46:20.041
It was a misunderstanding.

46:20.666 --> 46:23.416
A tragic one, but one nonetheless.

46:25.416 --> 46:27.833
These children see life
in a more innocent way.

46:29.541 --> 46:31.000
And you know what they need?

46:32.208 --> 46:36.666
A mother who can teach them the difference
between what's right and what's wrong.

46:46.750 --> 46:50.666
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

46:50.666 --> 46:51.666
Amen.

48:03.458 --> 48:04.416
Tin!

48:04.916 --> 48:06.250
Tin, what's wrong?

48:06.833 --> 48:07.875
Are you all right?

48:09.708 --> 48:10.541
What's going on?

48:11.083 --> 48:12.291
The fire...

48:12.833 --> 48:14.291
The eternal fire.

48:15.250 --> 48:16.333
What is this?

48:23.000 --> 48:25.500
I don't want
any more penance in this house.

48:27.666 --> 48:29.041
Is that clear?

48:29.041 --> 48:33.333
Mommy, if we pray a lot,
will Kuki be resurrected?

48:33.333 --> 48:35.041
No, he won't be resurrected.

48:35.541 --> 48:37.875
- But the Bible says--
- Enough!

48:39.458 --> 48:40.500
Listen to me.

48:41.416 --> 48:42.625
This is very important.

48:43.416 --> 48:46.125
You can't just do
whatever the Bible says you should.

48:47.833 --> 48:50.458
Why not? It's the word of God.

48:50.458 --> 48:53.833
Yes, but it can't
be taken literally, word for word.

48:55.541 --> 48:57.916
You've read some stories
at school, haven't you?

48:59.000 --> 49:00.125
Mm-hmm.

49:00.125 --> 49:02.541
Tales about witches and wizards,

49:02.541 --> 49:06.333
stories of fairy godmothers,
tales of talking wolves and pigs.

49:06.833 --> 49:08.166
But animals don't speak.

49:08.166 --> 49:10.041
Of course they don't speak.

49:11.083 --> 49:12.416
Because it's fantasy.

49:13.750 --> 49:15.916
It's an imaginary world
that doesn't exist.

49:16.666 --> 49:18.208
The Bible is fantasy.

49:19.375 --> 49:22.708
There are no such things as angels
and demons or Heaven and Hell.

49:23.333 --> 49:25.291
I think they do exist.

49:25.291 --> 49:26.875
I think so as well.

49:28.541 --> 49:31.666
And you, you will believe too someday.

49:50.416 --> 49:51.541
What are you laughing about?

49:51.541 --> 49:53.875
Daddy!

49:53.875 --> 49:55.583
Come here.

49:57.375 --> 49:58.208
Hey.

49:59.500 --> 50:02.166
Do you know who I saw
from the plane on Christmas Eve?

50:02.166 --> 50:03.666
Uh, God?

50:03.666 --> 50:06.208
No. It was Santa Claus.

50:06.208 --> 50:08.583
With his sleigh and reindeers.
You know what he said to me?

50:09.208 --> 50:11.791
"Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas, Adolfo!"

50:11.791 --> 50:14.791
"I have here in my sleigh
something for your children."

50:14.791 --> 50:16.291
Huh?

50:17.500 --> 50:19.333
Wow! This is so cool!

50:19.333 --> 50:20.875
He also gave me this.

50:20.875 --> 50:22.458
ENRIQUE AND ANA
CHINESE SPINNING PLATE

50:22.458 --> 50:25.291
"Super spinning disks."

50:33.041 --> 50:35.041
Almost didn't make it because of the snow.

50:35.583 --> 50:36.625
I have a lot to do.

50:36.625 --> 50:37.791
- Hmm?
- Mm.

50:38.625 --> 50:39.541
You okay?

50:40.125 --> 50:41.000
Yes.

50:41.916 --> 50:43.625
- I'm going to go get changed.
- All right.

50:50.625 --> 50:54.458
<i>This song is one of the top hits of 1981.</i>

50:54.458 --> 50:57.583
<i>I'm sure you all know
what song I'm talking about, right?</i>

50:57.583 --> 50:59.500
<i>Are you ready? Let's dance.</i>

51:09.625 --> 51:11.166
Oh, you're tired.

51:13.958 --> 51:15.458
How much longer till midnight?

51:15.458 --> 51:16.958
It won't be long now. Look.

51:17.500 --> 51:20.125
When both hands on the clock
are here, it's midnight.

51:20.625 --> 51:21.458
Hmm.

51:21.458 --> 51:26.750
Seven, eight, nine...

51:26.750 --> 51:28.666
Mommy, the coffee's ready.

51:31.333 --> 51:35.375
Ten, eleven, and twelve.

51:36.041 --> 51:38.125
All done. What do I do now?

51:39.166 --> 51:41.875
You can, uh,
sprinkle sugar on the cake if you want.

51:43.083 --> 51:44.291
It's in the cupboard.

51:53.125 --> 51:55.458
- No, not that!
- What's wrong, Mommy?

51:55.458 --> 51:57.083
That's for killing bugs.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.291
What is that doing here?

52:00.208 --> 52:01.375
<i>This</i> is the sugar.

52:04.708 --> 52:06.916
<i>Our cameras
are bringing you these...</i>

52:06.916 --> 52:08.291
I've got the grapes!

52:08.291 --> 52:09.666
That's great, sweetie.

52:10.250 --> 52:11.375
Thank you.

52:11.375 --> 52:12.583
You're welcome.

52:13.750 --> 52:15.125
You remember what I said?

52:15.625 --> 52:16.708
No.

52:16.708 --> 52:18.708
What do you mean, no? What about you?

52:18.708 --> 52:21.125
- No.
- You don't either?

52:23.166 --> 52:24.458
The coffee's ready.

52:24.458 --> 52:26.458
Great. Make some room for Mom.

52:27.750 --> 52:28.625
Let's go over it.

52:29.291 --> 52:30.708
First, the ball goes down.

52:30.708 --> 52:32.583
- I remember that.
- It goes down.

52:32.583 --> 52:35.625
That's when it starts.
That's our cue. And you take a grape.

52:35.625 --> 52:36.791
Yes, I know.

52:36.791 --> 52:39.208
- And every time the bell rings...
- One grape!

52:39.208 --> 52:40.833
- You got it. Very good.
- Whoo!

52:42.875 --> 52:43.708
Mommy?

52:43.708 --> 52:45.041
- Lola!
- Mommy?

52:46.583 --> 52:48.541
Lola! Lola!

52:48.541 --> 52:53.875
EMERGENCY

52:59.208 --> 53:00.958
María de los Dolores?

53:02.041 --> 53:04.208
I just received the results of your tests.

53:05.375 --> 53:08.375
You've had your New Year's Eve interrupted
for a good reason.

53:09.791 --> 53:11.125
I don't understand.

53:12.250 --> 53:14.083
You're going to have a baby.

53:20.208 --> 53:21.416
But that's impossible.

53:22.916 --> 53:24.583
Consider it a miracle.

53:29.708 --> 53:30.791
Happy New Year.

53:40.750 --> 53:43.375
A great magician from the East,

53:43.375 --> 53:44.916
Kin Khan Kun the soothsayer,

53:44.916 --> 53:47.791
showed me his secret,
the super Chinese spinning plate.

54:16.416 --> 54:18.791
Very good. You did that very well.

54:18.791 --> 54:20.291
Did you like it, Mommy?

54:20.916 --> 54:21.875
Yes, very much.

54:21.875 --> 54:23.416
And our little brother?

54:23.416 --> 54:24.708
Hang on a second.

54:26.125 --> 54:27.375
He absolutely loved it.

54:29.583 --> 54:31.750
Go on, off to bed.
You need to rest up for tomorrow.

54:31.750 --> 54:33.625
You believe in God now, right?

54:34.875 --> 54:36.083
What makes you say that?

54:36.083 --> 54:39.375
Well, because our baby brother
is going to be born, thanks to a miracle.

54:39.375 --> 54:42.708
It's true. I asked Him for it,
and He made it happen.

54:42.708 --> 54:44.708
There are no such things as miracles.

54:45.625 --> 54:47.625
Everything in life can be explained.

54:48.625 --> 54:51.666
- You have eyes, but you don't see.
- What don't I see?

54:51.666 --> 54:55.958
When Jesus was born, his mother,
the Virgin Mary, suffered a lot

54:55.958 --> 54:59.833
because she already knew that her son
would have to die to save us all.

54:59.833 --> 55:01.125
A sacrifice.

55:02.250 --> 55:06.000
And what if God wants to sacrifice
our baby brother to save us?

55:06.500 --> 55:10.208
That'd be a shame.
I don't want him to die. Right, Mommy?

55:44.583 --> 55:46.416
Hello, Draculas.

55:46.416 --> 55:48.083
Are you guys nervous?

55:48.791 --> 55:51.458
Today, you'll be receiving
the body of Christ.

55:52.375 --> 55:55.416
Although I'm pretty sure
you two would much prefer to receive

55:55.416 --> 55:58.541
the blessing of the Holy Ghost!

55:58.541 --> 56:00.458
It's blasphemy, Tina!

56:00.458 --> 56:02.416
He said the unforgivable!

56:02.416 --> 56:04.500
Don't worry, Tin. Don't you worry.

56:04.500 --> 56:06.500
God will deliver justice.

56:29.125 --> 56:30.541
I don't see the children.

57:02.958 --> 57:05.708
Many thanks
to the children in the choir.

57:05.708 --> 57:08.416
And also, to our young friends,
Tin and Tina,

57:08.416 --> 57:11.083
who have accompanied us on the organ.

57:17.625 --> 57:19.375
<i>Take this and eat it.</i>

57:19.375 --> 57:22.458
<i>This is the body of Christ,
which will grant you eternal life.</i>

57:22.458 --> 57:23.583
Amen.

57:27.000 --> 57:28.708
Take this and eat it.

57:28.708 --> 57:32.125
This is the body of Christ,
which will grant you eternal life.

57:32.125 --> 57:33.208
Amen.

57:35.041 --> 57:36.916
Take this and eat it.

57:37.416 --> 57:41.583
This is the body of Christ,
which will grant you eternal life.

57:41.583 --> 57:42.625
Amen.

57:44.916 --> 57:46.916
Take this and eat it.

57:46.916 --> 57:51.291
This is the body of Christ,
which will grant you eternal life.

57:51.291 --> 57:52.333
Amen.

58:11.875 --> 58:14.750
Let's go, come on.
We have to do this.

58:15.333 --> 58:16.666
Let's go together.

58:17.333 --> 58:18.250
Come on.

58:22.000 --> 58:23.333
Good night, Mommy.

58:24.333 --> 58:25.458
Good night.

58:29.291 --> 58:31.666
Was that the boy
that bullies you at school?

58:32.458 --> 58:34.125
He calls us Draculas.

58:35.125 --> 58:37.583
Do you have anything to do
with what happened to him?

58:40.583 --> 58:41.875
You mustn't lie to me.

58:43.708 --> 58:45.000
Lying is a sin.

58:48.500 --> 58:50.125
You don't have to worry, Mommy.

58:50.625 --> 58:52.666
We'll pray really hard for him.

58:55.791 --> 58:57.041
You two go to bed now.

59:01.166 --> 59:02.833
Pedro. Pedro...

59:31.500 --> 59:32.708
Hello?

59:32.708 --> 59:37.250
<i>Hello. The school gave me
your number. I'm sorry to bother you.</i>

59:37.250 --> 59:39.291
You're not bothering me.

59:39.291 --> 59:41.958
<i>You were there for the First Communions
the other day, weren't you?</i>

59:41.958 --> 59:42.875
Yes.

59:43.375 --> 59:44.625
<i>I'm Pedro's mother.</i>

59:45.541 --> 59:47.208
<i>The boy who had the accident.</i>

59:47.708 --> 59:50.333
How is he doing?

59:50.333 --> 59:51.291
<i>Bad.</i>

59:52.583 --> 59:54.125
<i>He's in a coma.</i>

59:55.083 --> 59:56.500
My God, I'm so sorry.

59:57.500 --> 01:00:00.625
<i>Some of the children have said
that during the procession,</i>

01:00:00.625 --> 01:00:03.916
<i>they saw my Pedro
lagging behind with your children, and--</i>

01:00:03.916 --> 01:00:05.750
- But the police said that--
-<i>Yeah.</i>

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:09.625
<i>Yeah, the police said he slipped
and... and fell down the rocks.</i>

01:00:10.125 --> 01:00:13.916
<i>But I don't know. I have a feeling
that that's not what happened.</i>

01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:16.750
<i>I know my son is not a saint</i>

01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:18.791
<i>and that he picked on your kids.</i>

01:00:18.791 --> 01:00:21.250
<i>And I can understand
that they would want to...</i>

01:00:22.791 --> 01:00:24.833
<i>I'm sorry, I shouldn't have called you.</i>

01:00:26.083 --> 01:00:29.583
<i>You can't imagine how hard it is</i>

01:00:30.083 --> 01:00:34.750
<i>to think that at any moment
your son could die.</i>

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:35.791
Mommy.

01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:39.833
Who's on the phone?

01:00:41.083 --> 01:00:42.000
No one.

01:01:24.333 --> 01:01:25.833
SPARE THE ROD, SPOIL THE CHILD

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:28.500
Lola.

01:01:29.416 --> 01:01:30.458
Lola.

01:01:30.958 --> 01:01:32.208
Well?

01:01:34.458 --> 01:01:36.125
This may sound strange to you.

01:01:37.500 --> 01:01:39.000
But I really need to know...

01:01:41.166 --> 01:01:43.916
if Tin and Tina ever got involved
in any kind of trouble

01:01:43.916 --> 01:01:45.166
with other children.

01:01:45.916 --> 01:01:47.000
No, never.

01:01:47.625 --> 01:01:49.375
Have they done something wrong?

01:01:50.333 --> 01:01:51.333
I'm not sure.

01:01:53.333 --> 01:01:56.583
But they may have made a mistake
with terrible consequences.

01:01:57.583 --> 01:01:59.833
Do you have any evidence
to make you suspect them?

01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:08.375
Are you quite sure
that they never did anything violent?

01:02:09.250 --> 01:02:11.833
Perhaps some misinterpretation
of the Bible?

01:02:14.708 --> 01:02:16.166
John 10:14.

01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:19.583
"I am the good shepherd."

01:02:20.333 --> 01:02:21.958
"I care for my sheep."

01:02:22.458 --> 01:02:24.791
"And without any hesitation<i>,</i>

01:02:24.791 --> 01:02:27.208
I lay down my life for every one of them."

01:02:31.291 --> 01:02:34.916
Perhaps your way of leading the flock
is not the most appropriate way.

01:02:36.916 --> 01:02:38.541
"Spare the rod and spoil the child."

01:02:39.833 --> 01:02:41.875
Suffering is necessary.

01:02:43.666 --> 01:02:47.666
Nobody can seek Christ without suffering
the pain of carrying his cross.

01:02:47.666 --> 01:02:49.500
I'm just saying that Tin and Tina--

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:52.958
Tin and Tina are two beings of the light.

01:02:54.041 --> 01:02:56.125
Mischievous, like all children,

01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:59.541
but they are pure, righteous, and kind.

01:03:02.208 --> 01:03:04.541
It is not they who are the problem.

01:03:05.458 --> 01:03:07.333
It is you.

01:03:07.333 --> 01:03:09.541
You judge them without knowing.

01:03:10.583 --> 01:03:12.000
And that is a sin.

01:03:13.250 --> 01:03:15.583
You really shouldn't imagine things.

01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:19.291
- I shouldn't have come here.
- Wrong.

01:03:20.916 --> 01:03:23.541
God has brought you here today
for a good reason.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.875
Where is God

01:03:26.875 --> 01:03:31.125
when babies are allowed to die
without having the chance to live?

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:32.791
Where is He?

01:03:51.958 --> 01:03:53.458
God is right here.

01:03:54.708 --> 01:03:56.916
Absence is presence.

01:03:57.833 --> 01:03:59.666
That is the great mystery.

01:04:07.458 --> 01:04:08.583
I'm sorry.

01:04:14.416 --> 01:04:16.666
The dark night of the soul.

01:04:20.083 --> 01:04:22.208
You are absorbed by the darkness.

01:04:22.875 --> 01:04:23.791
You must seek.

01:04:24.541 --> 01:04:26.166
Never cease to seek.

01:04:27.666 --> 01:04:30.166
Only then will you find the light.

01:06:01.625 --> 01:06:02.958
The wrath.

01:06:20.583 --> 01:06:22.708
MATTHEW 12

01:06:37.041 --> 01:06:39.458
The wrath of God.

01:07:46.791 --> 01:07:47.875
How was the flight?

01:07:49.291 --> 01:07:52.708
The flight? Fine, as usual.
Wha-- What are you doing still up?

01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:54.916
You smell of alcohol.

01:07:56.041 --> 01:07:58.250
Yeah, I had a few drinks with the guys.

01:07:59.958 --> 01:08:02.083
I'm going to bed now, hon. I'm very tired.

01:08:02.083 --> 01:08:03.666
Can you come here a second?

01:08:04.458 --> 01:08:06.875
Lola, it's four in the morning.
What do you want?

01:08:07.375 --> 01:08:10.458
Could you <i>please</i>
come down here for a moment?

01:08:11.833 --> 01:08:13.000
Yes, of course.

01:08:21.958 --> 01:08:23.083
What's wrong?

01:08:26.416 --> 01:08:28.541
The boy from the Communion is in a coma.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:33.875
I think Tin and Tina are responsible

01:08:33.875 --> 01:08:36.500
and that they're playing
this horrendous game.

01:08:39.250 --> 01:08:40.333
I found these.

01:08:40.833 --> 01:08:42.708
And I think we should go to the police.

01:08:43.250 --> 01:08:44.375
It's evidence.

01:08:44.375 --> 01:08:45.541
Let me see.

01:08:51.416 --> 01:08:53.666
For God's sake, Lola,
they're just drawings.

01:08:54.708 --> 01:08:56.250
That boy was bullying them.

01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:59.833
It's normal that they'd do things
like this or even worse.

01:09:01.208 --> 01:09:03.333
And what if they're not
simply innocent children

01:09:03.333 --> 01:09:04.791
who misinterpret the Bible?

01:09:05.791 --> 01:09:07.500
What if they're just the opposite?

01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.750
What if they use the Bible

01:09:10.916 --> 01:09:14.000
to justify their evil actions?

01:09:16.291 --> 01:09:17.958
This is all because of the dog, right?

01:09:19.041 --> 01:09:20.416
Won't you ever forgive them?

01:09:22.541 --> 01:09:25.666
A mother should trust her children
and protect them.

01:09:25.666 --> 01:09:27.125
That's what I'm doing.

01:09:28.208 --> 01:09:30.666
Protecting the child I'm carrying.

01:09:30.666 --> 01:09:32.291
This is total nonsense.

01:09:33.916 --> 01:09:37.250
When that boy comes out of the coma,
he'll explain what happened.

01:09:37.750 --> 01:09:39.958
And now, I'm going to bed.

01:10:00.666 --> 01:10:03.000
Tina! Tina!

01:10:04.583 --> 01:10:05.916
Tina, wake up!

01:10:07.416 --> 01:10:08.541
What is it, Tin?

01:10:09.250 --> 01:10:10.333
The Bible!

01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:12.833
It's gone!

01:10:22.041 --> 01:10:24.833
Tin! The crucifixes!

01:10:28.416 --> 01:10:29.458
Mommy! Mommy!

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:32.916
The exterminating angel
has taken away all the crucifixes!

01:10:32.916 --> 01:10:34.666
And he's stolen our...!

01:10:41.083 --> 01:10:44.333
When you both are older,
you may open this box.

01:10:46.833 --> 01:10:49.833
But until then, there will be
no more religion in this house.

01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:54.083
And if for any reason

01:10:55.125 --> 01:10:56.833
you ever break this rule,

01:10:57.625 --> 01:10:59.791
you will go back
to the convent immediately.

01:11:02.916 --> 01:11:05.083
Have I made myself absolutely clear?

01:11:06.458 --> 01:11:07.500
Mm-hmm.

01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:08.583
Very good.

01:11:38.083 --> 01:11:39.750
Attention! Attention!

01:11:39.750 --> 01:11:42.333
We're going through
an area of great turbulence!

01:11:42.333 --> 01:11:44.833
Buckle your seatbelts
and brace yourselves!

01:11:48.291 --> 01:11:50.041
Hey, honey.

01:11:53.708 --> 01:11:54.708
Something wrong?

01:11:56.083 --> 01:11:56.958
Mommy.

01:12:16.166 --> 01:12:19.833
This happens to some pregnant women.
Hormones, stress...

01:12:19.833 --> 01:12:21.333
It was the kids, I know it.

01:12:22.875 --> 01:12:24.708
They're punishing me
for what I did to them.

01:12:24.708 --> 01:12:26.750
You see perversion where there is none.

01:12:27.458 --> 01:12:30.916
- Children are incapable of doing--
- Why do you always take their side?

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:36.833
Why can't you even remotely consider
the possibility that I might be right?

01:12:37.666 --> 01:12:39.000
Daddy!

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:39.958
Hmm?

01:12:39.958 --> 01:12:41.375
Daddy!

01:12:41.375 --> 01:12:43.583
Come play with us, please?

01:12:46.791 --> 01:12:47.875
I'm coming!

01:13:50.333 --> 01:13:51.708
<i>Good evening,</i>

01:13:51.708 --> 01:13:54.958
<i>and thank you all
for being here with us again.</i>

01:13:54.958 --> 01:13:58.166
<i>I say "you all" in a more colloquial way.</i>

01:13:58.166 --> 01:14:01.875
<i>Because on today's show,
we'll be addressing kids exclusively.</i>

01:14:01.875 --> 01:14:03.708
<i>Hello?</i>

01:14:04.416 --> 01:14:05.750
Hello.

01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:08.833
This is Lola, Tin and Tina's mother.

01:14:08.833 --> 01:14:11.541
I don't know if you remember me.

01:14:11.541 --> 01:14:13.583
<i>Of course I remember you.</i>

01:14:14.333 --> 01:14:16.541
I just wanted to know
how your son was doing.

01:14:17.791 --> 01:14:18.958
Is he better?

01:14:19.750 --> 01:14:22.416
<i>My son died three days ago.</i>

01:14:36.833 --> 01:14:39.875
- Lola?
-<i>...the ladies of Tightfist.</i>

01:14:46.166 --> 01:14:47.500
Hey, what's going on?

01:14:51.041 --> 01:14:52.041
The boy is dead.

01:14:54.041 --> 01:14:56.041
Don't go. Please stay with me.

01:14:56.958 --> 01:14:59.041
Just for today,
call in sick. Say you can't go.

01:14:59.041 --> 01:15:00.666
You know I can't do that.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:04.791
Please, I beg you.

01:15:05.333 --> 01:15:08.250
- Don't leave me alone with them.
- Lola, you need to get some rest.

01:15:09.041 --> 01:15:11.041
For the baby's sake and your own.

01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:15.625
What you're going to do now
is go to bed and get some sleep.

01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.333
And tomorrow, when you wake up,
I'll be right here, okay?

01:15:22.125 --> 01:15:23.166
Promise me?

01:15:23.166 --> 01:15:24.291
I promise you.

01:15:26.208 --> 01:15:27.166
Go on.

01:15:34.375 --> 01:15:35.458
Daddy.

01:15:37.125 --> 01:15:39.208
Why doesn't Mommy love us anymore?

01:15:39.208 --> 01:15:41.541
-<i>...the year that dies?</i>
-<i>No!</i>

01:15:41.541 --> 01:15:42.958
Why do you say that?

01:15:44.583 --> 01:15:47.291
She gives us mean looks
and won't talk to us.

01:15:47.291 --> 01:15:49.166
Mommy loves you both very much.

01:15:50.375 --> 01:15:54.125
The thing is, uh,
women who are pregnant get very tired.

01:15:54.125 --> 01:15:55.875
And they need a lot of love.

01:15:57.208 --> 01:15:59.750
Why don't you show her tomorrow
how much you love her, huh?

01:15:59.750 --> 01:16:01.958
You and your little brother.

01:16:01.958 --> 01:16:04.125
Come on, give me a kiss. I gotta go.

01:16:04.125 --> 01:16:06.625
<i>Kids,
we heard you like laughing.</i>

01:16:08.250 --> 01:16:12.041
<i>They like to laugh. That's horrid.</i>

01:16:12.041 --> 01:16:16.166
<i>Torquemada and his men
must be spinning round in their graves.</i>

01:16:37.666 --> 01:16:38.833
Adolfo.

01:16:43.541 --> 01:16:44.916
Mm.

01:16:53.250 --> 01:16:54.458
Adolfo!

01:16:58.708 --> 01:16:59.625
Tin.

01:17:01.125 --> 01:17:03.083
Tin, untie me. What are you doing?

01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:10.166
Tin, untie me right now.

01:17:13.166 --> 01:17:15.166
Good morning, Super Mommy.

01:17:15.166 --> 01:17:17.333
You need to rest up and eat well.

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:19.458
Or our baby brother won't be born.

01:17:21.958 --> 01:17:24.500
- I put some magic powder in it.
- Huh?

01:17:24.500 --> 01:17:26.833
And now, for your entertainment,

01:17:26.833 --> 01:17:29.291
please welcome Rupertín!

01:17:29.791 --> 01:17:32.666
One, two, three!

01:17:32.666 --> 01:17:35.041
Here we are with you again today!

01:17:35.708 --> 01:17:37.250
- No! No!
- It's delicious.

01:17:37.250 --> 01:17:40.083
...unique of game shows
and getready...

01:17:40.083 --> 01:17:42.916
...to test your knowledge.

01:17:44.958 --> 01:17:48.208
Please, time to leave
your grouchiness behind.

01:17:48.791 --> 01:17:53.875
And join us
for the best half hour on television!

01:17:54.958 --> 01:17:57.375
Come on! Drink!

01:18:00.166 --> 01:18:01.041
It's not working.

01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.333
I guess we'll have to try and find
another way to feed our baby brother.

01:18:06.333 --> 01:18:07.458
I have an idea!

01:18:09.041 --> 01:18:10.000
Where are you going?

01:18:11.250 --> 01:18:12.541
Tina, untie me!

01:18:19.791 --> 01:18:21.541
Look.

01:18:21.541 --> 01:18:23.833
Tin, you never cease to amaze me.

01:18:24.916 --> 01:18:28.083
What you're doing is a mortal sin.
What do you think God would say?

01:18:28.083 --> 01:18:29.208
Shhh.

01:18:29.208 --> 01:18:31.875
Religion is forbidden
in this house, remember?

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:36.375
One, two, three!

01:18:36.375 --> 01:18:39.958
Everybody, please, pay attention!

01:18:39.958 --> 01:18:43.500
Sit back and relax
and we'll soon start the show!

01:18:58.208 --> 01:19:02.500
Poison! Poison! Poison! Poison!

01:19:03.541 --> 01:19:05.000
- Poison!
- Mommy.

01:19:06.583 --> 01:19:07.875
Stay away from me!

01:19:09.583 --> 01:19:11.375
It's just milk with some sugar.

01:19:16.166 --> 01:19:17.208
Lola.

01:19:30.083 --> 01:19:32.833
Lola, for God's sake,
it was just a kids' game,

01:19:32.833 --> 01:19:34.833
and you were pointing a knife at them.

01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:38.500
- They tried to poison me.
- They were making you breakfast.

01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:40.875
That's all. It was my fault.

01:19:42.250 --> 01:19:44.291
I'd asked them to show you some love.

01:19:44.875 --> 01:19:47.375
I understand you were afraid
that you would lose the baby again,

01:19:47.375 --> 01:19:48.458
but you didn't.

01:19:48.458 --> 01:19:51.791
Everything went well,
and the baby is doing great.

01:19:52.958 --> 01:19:54.375
Let's start over, all right?

01:19:58.458 --> 01:19:59.416
Mmm.

01:20:02.625 --> 01:20:04.708
Here's your mom and dad.

01:20:05.916 --> 01:20:07.541
- Hi.
- There you go.

01:20:08.125 --> 01:20:10.708
He looks just like me.

01:20:12.041 --> 01:20:13.500
Hi, little prince.

01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.208
He's adorable.

01:20:22.291 --> 01:20:23.541
Come here, kids.

01:20:29.541 --> 01:20:31.000
This is your little brother.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.875
He looks just like a peanut.

01:20:34.208 --> 01:20:35.291
Can I give him a kiss?

01:20:38.958 --> 01:20:39.875
Come on.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:45.208
Be gentle with him.

01:20:49.291 --> 01:20:50.541
Hi, little brother.

01:20:53.666 --> 01:20:55.500
When is he going to be baptized?

01:20:56.333 --> 01:20:57.791
He's not going to be baptized.

01:20:58.375 --> 01:21:01.625
But children that aren't baptized
go to Limbo.

01:21:01.625 --> 01:21:03.458
And that's a horrible place.

01:21:03.458 --> 01:21:05.791
Lola, come on, most babies get baptized.

01:21:06.666 --> 01:21:10.083
Well, this baby will get to choose
his religion when he comes of age.

01:21:11.125 --> 01:21:13.583
- Times have changed, all right?
- Maybe.

01:21:13.583 --> 01:21:17.500
But we do live in a democracy,
and you know what that means, right?

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.250
The will of the majority prevails.

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:21.875
Who wants him to be baptized, hmm?

01:21:26.166 --> 01:21:28.500
No. No.

01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:30.333
The people have spoken.

01:21:45.375 --> 01:21:46.666
Anything yet?

01:21:46.666 --> 01:21:48.166
No!

01:21:53.666 --> 01:21:55.791
And now?

01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:58.833
- Yes! Now it's on!
- All right!

01:22:01.458 --> 01:22:03.833
<i>Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:22:03.833 --> 01:22:07.083
<i>from the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium</i>

01:22:07.083 --> 01:22:08.333
<i>in Madrid...</i>

01:22:08.333 --> 01:22:09.666
Mommy!

01:22:10.166 --> 01:22:11.875
Mommy, look!

01:22:13.166 --> 01:22:15.583
Mommy, come see what we're doing!

01:22:18.291 --> 01:22:19.791
Mommy!

01:22:20.958 --> 01:22:22.500
It's a miracle!

01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:27.083
We're walking on water!

01:22:28.625 --> 01:22:29.791
Ah, come on, get out.

01:22:29.791 --> 01:22:32.166
Don't stay in the sun too long,
and put on some sunscreen.

01:22:32.166 --> 01:22:33.375
- Lola.
- What?

01:22:33.375 --> 01:22:34.625
Get me another one.

01:22:34.625 --> 01:22:37.416
<i>...and many, many photographers...</i>

01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:42.750
<i>And we're getting ready.
We're just waiting now.</i>

01:22:58.208 --> 01:23:00.458
Is the omelet ready yet?
The game is about to start.

01:23:00.458 --> 01:23:02.041
Look, I'm doing my best.

01:23:02.750 --> 01:23:03.625
Hey.

01:23:04.208 --> 01:23:05.250
What?

01:23:05.250 --> 01:23:06.833
Aren't you forgetting something?

01:23:31.583 --> 01:23:34.208
<i>Throw-in
for the Spanish national team.</i>

01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:37.125
<i>And Dremmler...</i>

01:23:37.625 --> 01:23:38.833
<i>moves it to Förster.</i>

01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:43.250
-<i>Förster with a slick pass to Kaltz.</i>
- Tin, I think she's gone.

01:23:44.375 --> 01:23:45.916
Daddy, we're going to bapt--

01:23:45.916 --> 01:23:48.708
You two, I wanna watch
the game in peace, all right?

01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:51.041
-<i>They've got it back.</i>
- Hmm.

01:23:51.750 --> 01:23:53.666
<i>Oh, we have a--
We have a dead play.</i>

01:23:53.666 --> 01:23:55.791
<i>We're going to have to go
for the corner kick.</i>

01:23:58.958 --> 01:24:00.583
Hey, calm down, you.

01:24:04.458 --> 01:24:05.958
Come on, you little chickies.

01:24:18.791 --> 01:24:20.458
Hello, little brother.

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:34.583
Shh.

01:24:40.958 --> 01:24:43.333
<i>Quick pass. Kaltz.</i>

01:24:43.333 --> 01:24:45.833
<i>Kaltz making his move. Dremmler.</i>

01:24:45.833 --> 01:24:49.833
<i>Dremmler open to Förster. Förster.
Förster sending it back to Breitner.</i>

01:24:51.833 --> 01:24:54.625
<i>There we have Camacho,
who is chasing, as you can see.</i>

01:25:00.166 --> 01:25:01.416
Hey, relax.

01:25:06.166 --> 01:25:09.041
<i>Again,
Dremmler for Bernd Förster.</i>

01:25:09.041 --> 01:25:10.875
<i>There we have Zamora next to him.</i>

01:25:10.875 --> 01:25:12.708
No need to be afraid, okay?

01:25:12.708 --> 01:25:15.250
You just have to stay relaxed, all right?

01:25:16.541 --> 01:25:18.916
<i>...the right back
of the Spanish team.</i>

01:25:20.125 --> 01:25:22.000
<i>There we have Camacho.</i>

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:24.416
Now, hold him by his feet.

01:25:24.416 --> 01:25:26.666
He's really heavy.

01:25:26.666 --> 01:25:29.916
-"Genesis 1:2."
-<i>Breitner gets the ball.</i>

01:25:31.791 --> 01:25:34.416
"<i>Now the Earth
was formless and empty."</i>

01:25:34.416 --> 01:25:37.375
"Darkness was over
the surface of the deep,

01:25:37.375 --> 01:25:40.375
and the Spirit of God
was hovering over the waters."

01:25:40.375 --> 01:25:42.166
- Now?
- Mm-mm.

01:25:42.166 --> 01:25:43.666
<i>Breitner's with him.</i>

01:25:43.666 --> 01:25:47.250
"I will sprinkle clean water on you,
and you will be clean."

01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:50.375
"I will cleanse you
from all your impurities

01:25:50.375 --> 01:25:51.958
and from all your idols."

01:25:51.958 --> 01:25:55.250
"I will remove from you
your heart of stone

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:57.750
and give you a heart of flesh."

01:25:58.708 --> 01:25:59.625
Okay, now.

01:26:02.416 --> 01:26:04.791
<i>Dremmler. Dremmler to Kaltz.</i>

01:26:05.458 --> 01:26:08.083
<i>The German team is dominating the field.</i>

01:26:09.958 --> 01:26:12.541
Five, six, seven, eight, nine.

01:26:16.291 --> 01:26:17.500
Go on, go away.

01:26:18.333 --> 01:26:19.958
Can I take him out now?

01:26:19.958 --> 01:26:22.291
No. We need to purify him well.

01:26:32.625 --> 01:26:35.500
-<i>Dremmler shoots.</i>
- No. No, no, no, no! What?

01:26:35.500 --> 01:26:37.208
<i>Dremmler foots it in!</i>

01:26:37.208 --> 01:26:39.125
<i>The Germans have scored.</i>

01:26:39.125 --> 01:26:40.958
We're going to get wiped out.

01:26:45.291 --> 01:26:46.958
<i>He passes to Camacho.</i>

01:26:57.208 --> 01:26:58.791
Mommy?

01:27:00.125 --> 01:27:01.500
What are you doing?!

01:27:02.250 --> 01:27:03.083
What's going on?

01:27:03.083 --> 01:27:05.250
My baby! My baby!

01:27:05.250 --> 01:27:07.000
What have they done to you?

01:27:16.041 --> 01:27:17.458
Mommy.

01:27:19.708 --> 01:27:21.125
We were bapti--

01:27:21.125 --> 01:27:22.666
But Daddy said we could--

01:27:24.833 --> 01:27:27.000
What kind of father are you?

01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.416
They're drowning your son
and you don't see it!

01:27:32.708 --> 01:27:34.166
- Give me that!
- No!

01:27:34.166 --> 01:27:38.333
No, Daddy!
No, Daddy, no! No, Daddy!

01:27:39.291 --> 01:27:42.583
- No, please don't!
- No, no, no!

01:27:42.583 --> 01:27:44.041
- No, Daddy, no!
- No!

01:27:46.083 --> 01:27:47.291
No! Please!

01:27:48.250 --> 01:27:49.666
You are not my children.

01:27:50.291 --> 01:27:51.625
No!

01:27:52.833 --> 01:27:54.250
No!

01:28:03.166 --> 01:28:04.500
I'm sorry.

01:28:12.250 --> 01:28:13.583
Are you sure about this?

01:28:16.458 --> 01:28:17.333
Yes.

01:28:45.791 --> 01:28:47.625
Yay!

01:28:48.583 --> 01:28:49.583
Handsome boy.

01:28:55.333 --> 01:28:58.125
There you go, sleep now.

01:28:58.958 --> 01:29:00.000
Are you okay?

01:29:04.625 --> 01:29:05.708
The children.

01:29:08.333 --> 01:29:10.666
They no longer have
a family to celebrate with.

01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:14.625
Listen, we agreed
not to talk about this anymore.

01:29:17.875 --> 01:29:19.666
I wonder if I was a bad mother.

01:29:21.583 --> 01:29:24.250
- I'm sure they must hate me.
- Don't torture yourself.

01:29:25.500 --> 01:29:27.666
It wasn't a good idea to adopt them.

01:29:27.666 --> 01:29:30.541
I told you right from the start,
I thought they were strange.

01:29:35.333 --> 01:29:40.000
Honey, if we want to be happy,
we have to look to the future.

01:29:40.583 --> 01:29:42.708
And the future is this little guy here.

01:29:43.750 --> 01:29:45.666
<i>He</i> is how we're going to move forward.

01:29:49.166 --> 01:29:51.333
<i>Jesus of my life.</i>

01:29:51.333 --> 01:29:53.625
<i>You are a child like me.</i>

01:29:53.625 --> 01:29:56.666
That is why
I love you so much

01:29:56.666 --> 01:29:58.708
and I offer you my heart.

01:29:59.833 --> 01:30:03.250
Take it. It is yours, not mine.

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:09.166
Jesus of my life, you are a child like me.

01:30:10.375 --> 01:30:12.666
That is why I love you so much

01:30:12.666 --> 01:30:15.083
and offer you my heart.

01:30:19.958 --> 01:30:21.333
Do you hear that?

01:30:22.333 --> 01:30:24.250
That is the wrath of God.

01:30:25.041 --> 01:30:27.250
That is the wrath of God.

01:30:28.125 --> 01:30:30.500
The day of wrath is drawing near.

01:30:30.500 --> 01:30:34.333
And on this day, justice will prevail.

01:30:39.666 --> 01:30:41.750
Galatians 6:7.

01:30:42.250 --> 01:30:44.625
"Do not be fooled, God cannot be mocked."

01:30:45.125 --> 01:30:49.583
"For whatever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap."

01:30:49.583 --> 01:30:52.750
"Do not be fooled,
God cannot be mocked."

01:30:52.750 --> 01:30:58.916
"For whatever a man soweth,
that shall he also reap."

01:30:58.916 --> 01:31:00.208
Good night, children.

01:31:00.208 --> 01:31:03.541
Good night, Mother Asunción.

01:31:38.875 --> 01:31:40.416
I'm going to look for a job.

01:31:43.166 --> 01:31:45.250
As a seamstress.

01:31:49.416 --> 01:31:51.000
Honey, you're talking nonsense.

01:31:52.541 --> 01:31:54.166
Who's gonna look after the baby?

01:32:12.166 --> 01:32:13.708
Are you not hearing him cry, or...?

01:32:18.958 --> 01:32:20.000
Lola.

01:32:21.958 --> 01:32:24.333
Can you pick up the baby, please?
Can't you see he's crying?

01:32:24.333 --> 01:32:25.833
Why can't you do it?

01:32:30.375 --> 01:32:34.000
You know I'm not good at this.
I'm asking you. Please, pick up your son.

01:32:35.375 --> 01:32:38.250
Lola, what do I have to do
to get you to pick up your son?

01:32:42.041 --> 01:32:43.583
I'm begging you, please!

01:32:44.916 --> 01:32:45.833
Sorry.

01:32:52.958 --> 01:32:55.791
Come here. There, there, now.

01:32:55.791 --> 01:32:56.875
Come here.

01:33:05.291 --> 01:33:06.208
Don't drive so fast.

01:33:06.208 --> 01:33:07.625
I'm not driving fast.

01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:14.166
Watch out!

01:33:29.791 --> 01:33:30.666
You both okay?

01:33:31.916 --> 01:33:32.916
What was that?

01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:34.750
No idea.

01:33:35.333 --> 01:33:39.000
Probably a deer or something.
A lot of them around.

01:34:12.833 --> 01:34:14.333
Good night, sweet boy.

01:35:41.875 --> 01:35:43.541
You left the door open.

01:35:44.708 --> 01:35:47.375
Funny. Could've sworn I closed it.

01:35:48.666 --> 01:35:49.833
Sit down with me.

01:35:52.083 --> 01:35:53.750
I'm tired. I'm going to bed.

01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.500
Lola.

01:35:56.416 --> 01:35:58.916
- Please.
-<i>So we can start playing.</i>

01:36:07.625 --> 01:36:09.875
- Come.
<i>- ...easy to win a million.</i>

01:36:09.875 --> 01:36:11.625
<i>Let's ask the audience.</i>

01:36:11.625 --> 01:36:14.666
<i>Who would play with that?</i>

01:36:14.666 --> 01:36:17.291
<i>And who would keep the oyster?</i>

01:36:18.416 --> 01:36:20.875
<i>What will there be
behind the wall?</i>

01:36:21.791 --> 01:36:24.375
<i>Please, open the door.</i>

01:36:24.375 --> 01:36:27.166
<i>This amazing pumpkin!</i>

01:36:27.166 --> 01:36:29.958
<i>Woo-hoo!</i>

01:36:29.958 --> 01:36:32.333
-<i>Oh my! Wow!</i>
-<i>Look at that!</i>

01:36:32.333 --> 01:36:34.916
<i>Oh my!</i>

01:36:37.083 --> 01:36:39.208
I think we'd be very good at this.

01:36:39.916 --> 01:36:41.291
Should we try out for it?

01:36:44.208 --> 01:36:45.458
Lola, what's the matter?

01:36:53.083 --> 01:36:54.833
Why did you take your ring off?

01:36:59.375 --> 01:37:00.625
This is a joke, right?

01:37:02.250 --> 01:37:03.333
Is this a joke, Lola?

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:06.125
Oh, fuck.

01:37:17.541 --> 01:37:18.666
Honey, uh...

01:37:20.291 --> 01:37:22.208
I've devoted my whole life to you.

01:37:24.375 --> 01:37:28.666
I gave you a nice house,
nice clothes, good food, even a son.

01:37:31.208 --> 01:37:32.708
And this is how you repay me?

01:37:35.500 --> 01:37:36.375
Lola.

01:37:41.416 --> 01:37:43.000
I love you very much.

01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:44.875
I love you both so much.

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:52.416
Is this because you think
I haven't been a good father?

01:37:54.833 --> 01:37:57.208
I don't know. Maybe you're right.
But I can change, Lola.

01:37:57.208 --> 01:37:58.208
Mm.

01:37:58.750 --> 01:38:00.875
I'm able to change, and I <i>will</i> change.

01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:06.000
Where are you going?

01:38:08.208 --> 01:38:09.416
To fix the TV.

01:39:57.375 --> 01:40:01.416
<i>What a wonderful prize!
I'm so excited to tell you...</i>

01:40:01.416 --> 01:40:03.083
Adolfo, it's working!

01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.250
<i>Just in case the light goes off,</i>

01:40:06.250 --> 01:40:10.166
<i>you'll be able to enjoy the sun
in a terrace in Malaga--</i>

01:40:54.708 --> 01:40:55.583
Children?

01:41:12.916 --> 01:41:13.791
Children?

01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:20.625
Where are you?

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:02.583
Children?

01:42:08.041 --> 01:42:09.375
Don't hide!

01:42:18.833 --> 01:42:20.416
This is not a game!

01:42:33.208 --> 01:42:34.291
Which one was it?

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:46.625
Adolfo, the power is out!

01:43:00.750 --> 01:43:02.583
Come on. Come on!

01:43:04.541 --> 01:43:05.875
Damn flashlight.

01:43:28.958 --> 01:43:30.916
Lola! Lola!

01:43:35.958 --> 01:43:36.958
Lola!

01:44:19.416 --> 01:44:20.791
Adolfo!

01:44:21.625 --> 01:44:23.333
Adolfo, I'm coming!

01:44:23.333 --> 01:44:26.083
I'm coming, Adolfo! Adolfo!

01:44:41.833 --> 01:44:43.083
Adolfo!

01:44:44.041 --> 01:44:46.291
A blanket! Blanket!

01:44:52.750 --> 01:44:55.041
I need a blanket!
A blanket! A blanket! Come on!

01:44:55.041 --> 01:44:57.291
Where's a blanket?

01:44:58.000 --> 01:45:02.125
No! Don't come in! Don't come in!
Don't come in! Don't come in!

01:45:05.750 --> 01:45:09.750
No!

01:45:43.083 --> 01:45:46.416
No!

01:45:49.500 --> 01:45:51.666
My baby! My baby!

01:45:52.541 --> 01:45:53.750
My baby!

01:47:14.333 --> 01:47:16.458
Help!

01:47:17.458 --> 01:47:21.000
Please, help!

01:52:10.750 --> 01:52:12.875
Shh. Quiet.

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.708
<i>We have great people.</i>

01:52:46.708 --> 01:52:50.375
<i>The Spanish people,
who deserve all of our sacrifice.</i>

01:52:51.791 --> 01:52:53.458
<i>After years
of fear and uncertainty,</i>

01:52:53.458 --> 01:52:54.708
<i>the transition period is over.</i>

01:52:54.708 --> 01:52:57.375
<i>General elections are a turning point
in the history of our country.</i>

01:53:15.250 --> 01:53:16.166
Lola.

01:53:16.833 --> 01:53:20.041
Lola. Can you hear me?

01:53:24.291 --> 01:53:26.166
The police told me what happened.

01:53:27.458 --> 01:53:29.916
I'm very sorry about your husband.

01:53:32.458 --> 01:53:33.625
What happened?

01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:38.041
They say that he was struck by lightning.

01:53:43.625 --> 01:53:45.000
Lightning?

01:53:46.125 --> 01:53:50.666
Apparently, there was a lot
of lightning in the area last night.

01:53:52.333 --> 01:53:53.875
A real tragedy.

01:53:54.541 --> 01:53:56.208
I prayed for his soul.

01:53:57.250 --> 01:53:58.666
And I prayed for you, too.

01:53:59.458 --> 01:54:00.666
My baby?

01:54:01.750 --> 01:54:03.958
He is safe and sound.

01:54:05.791 --> 01:54:08.750
When God shuts a door, He opens a window.

01:54:15.875 --> 01:54:17.166
And the children?

01:54:18.583 --> 01:54:19.958
Were they at the house?

01:54:20.791 --> 01:54:21.916
In the house?

01:54:22.625 --> 01:54:23.750
Of course not.

01:54:24.541 --> 01:54:27.541
Tin and Tina slept all night
in the convent.

01:54:28.875 --> 01:54:31.083
I know. I'm the one
who woke them up this morning.

01:54:32.250 --> 01:54:34.916
- But--
- No. They weren't there.

01:54:35.875 --> 01:54:37.208
It's impossible.

01:54:50.041 --> 01:54:51.125
The children...

01:54:53.333 --> 01:54:54.750
are innocent?

01:54:56.416 --> 01:54:57.625
Mm.

01:54:59.125 --> 01:55:01.375
They've always been innocent.

01:55:08.458 --> 01:55:09.958
They are innocent.

01:55:09.958 --> 01:55:13.375
<i>Reading of the Gospel
according to Saint Matthew.</i>

01:55:13.375 --> 01:55:15.750
18:1-5, 10.

01:55:16.375 --> 01:55:20.791
"At that time,
the disciples came to Jesus and asked,

01:55:20.791 --> 01:55:24.000
'Who then is the greatest
in the kingdom of Heaven?'"

01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:26.625
"He called a little child to him...

01:55:26.625 --> 01:55:28.708
...and placed the child among them."

01:55:29.208 --> 01:55:30.875
"And he said, 'I tell you the truth...'"

01:55:30.875 --> 01:55:32.791
Mommy, do you like them?

01:55:32.791 --> 01:55:34.708
"'...and become
like little children...'"

01:55:34.708 --> 01:55:35.958
They are beautiful, son.

01:55:35.958 --> 01:55:39.000
"'...you will never enter
the kingdom of Heaven.'"

01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.708
"'Therefore, whoever humbles himself

01:55:41.708 --> 01:55:44.625
like this child
is the greatest in the kingdom...'"

01:55:44.625 --> 01:55:45.791
Come, daughter.

01:55:46.458 --> 01:55:50.083
"'And whoever welcomes
a little child like this...'"

01:55:50.083 --> 01:55:51.500
Can you put it on me?

01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:53.000
"'...welcomes me.'"

01:55:53.791 --> 01:55:56.375
"'But if anyone causes
one of these little ones

01:55:56.375 --> 01:55:57.916
who believe in me to sin,

01:55:58.416 --> 01:56:01.750
it would be better for him to have
a large millstone hung around his neck

01:56:01.750 --> 01:56:04.791
and to be drowned
in the depths of the sea.' Amen."

01:56:04.791 --> 01:56:06.791
Amen.

01:56:11.875 --> 01:56:13.458
Amen.
