WEBVTT

00:10.860 --> 00:13.695
I want to be your friend again.

00:13.711 --> 00:16.050
WWhy, Shaun? What happened?

00:16.052 --> 00:18.219
People need friends.

00:18.221 --> 00:20.621
Well...

00:20.623 --> 00:22.523
Yeah, they do.

00:22.525 --> 00:23.958
But you said

00:23.960 --> 00:26.753
you wanted me
to stop interfering, remember?

00:26.755 --> 00:28.963
You wanted space.

00:28.965 --> 00:31.666
You wanted to make your own mistakes.

00:31.668 --> 00:35.803
I need a friend more than I need space.

00:38.975 --> 00:42.143
You were a good mentor
and a good friend.

00:42.145 --> 00:44.746
Well, thank you, Shaun.

00:46.149 --> 00:48.683
You don't know
how much it means to me

00:48.685 --> 00:50.018
to hear you say that.

00:50.020 --> 00:52.420
But II think...

00:55.441 --> 00:58.659
I think you may need a new mentor.

01:01.164 --> 01:03.231
I'm dying.

12 to 18 months.

01:18.948 --> 01:22.450
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't tell anyone, okay?

01:22.452 --> 01:23.951
II will in my own time.

01:23.953 --> 01:24.952
Okay.

01:24.954 --> 01:26.601
Have you had a full workup?

01:26.603 --> 01:27.841
Yes, of course.

01:27.843 --> 01:30.291
It could be a secondary tumor

01:30.293 --> 01:32.627
metastasized to your brain
from somewhere else.

01:32.629 --> 01:33.817
It's the only tumor found.

01:33.819 --> 01:36.808
It could be an inflammatory
or infectious process.

01:36.809 --> 01:38.375
It was a tumor, Shaun.

01:38.377 --> 01:40.177
You should get a second opinion.

01:40.179 --> 01:41.878
Shaun, I've been a neurosurgeon
for 30 years.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.948
I think that qualifies
as a second opinion.

01:44.950 --> 01:48.785
You should get a second opinion.

01:48.787 --> 01:50.020
You have to know whether...

01:50.022 --> 01:51.388
All right, all right,
all right, all right, Shaun.

01:51.390 --> 01:52.889
I'll get a second opinion.

01:52.891 --> 01:54.024
Okay?

01:54.026 --> 01:55.258
Okay.

01:55.260 --> 01:57.796
Can I go to work now?

02:01.400 --> 02:03.667
Okay, Doctor, what's your diagnosis?

02:03.669 --> 02:04.835
I'm drunk.

02:04.837 --> 02:07.304
Not you. Other doctor.

02:08.674 --> 02:11.007
Well, given
the degree of the rotation

02:11.008 --> 02:13.043
and the fact that
the break is almost compound,

02:13.045 --> 02:14.845
I'd say we're dealing with a Bimalleolar

02:14.847 --> 02:16.079
or Trimalleolar fracture.

02:16.081 --> 02:18.081
Very good. What else?

02:18.083 --> 02:20.050
Um...

02:21.252 --> 02:22.319
Color?

02:22.960 --> 02:24.654
Blood flow is restricted.

02:24.656 --> 02:26.156
His foot's dying.

02:26.158 --> 02:28.325
No.

02:28.327 --> 02:30.753
I'm gonna have to reset it now.
Hold his leg.

02:31.274 --> 02:33.027
- No.
- No, it's Ok.

02:33.068 --> 02:35.076
It just going to take a second
I need you to count to three.

02:35.100 --> 02:36.533
One...

02:36.535 --> 02:38.201
One, - two...

02:38.203 --> 02:40.103
<b><font color="#0080C0">Aah!

02:43.008 --> 02:45.876
Is Caden's leg gonna be okay?

02:45.878 --> 02:47.878
How long has his leg been like this

02:47.880 --> 02:49.546
and how exactly did it happen?

02:49.548 --> 02:51.982
Well, he's been like that
since I found him.

02:51.984 --> 02:54.384
He probably tripped over
a curb or something

02:54.386 --> 02:56.553
because that's where he was.

02:56.555 --> 02:58.555
Any reason you felt the need
to tell me twice

02:58.557 --> 02:59.990
that you found him like this?

02:59.992 --> 03:02.916
<b></font></b> Dr. Park, boy's going to surgery.
You're going with.

03:03.629 --> 03:05.548
Don't go anywhere.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.341
Shouldn't I be asleep for this?

03:18.343 --> 03:21.511
Your blood alcohol level
complicates anesthesia

03:21.513 --> 03:23.513
and we think you have a concussion,

03:23.515 --> 03:25.515
so we're gonna keep you responsive.

03:25.517 --> 03:27.350
We did give you a regional nerve block,

03:27.352 --> 03:29.386
so you shouldn't feel anything.

03:31.689 --> 03:33.957
Cool.

03:33.959 --> 03:36.359
Bend the ICP plate over
two degrees on the proximal end.

03:36.361 --> 03:37.827
<b></font></b> Contouring pliers.

03:44.403 --> 03:46.102
BP is dropping, heart rate's rising.

03:46.104 --> 03:48.805
- Let's tube him.
- IV fluids and phenylephrine, stat.

03:48.807 --> 03:51.708
We need to abort until we can get a
handle on what else is going on.

03:51.710 --> 03:53.977
Give me a full body CT,
full blood panels, and an echo.

03:53.979 --> 03:56.479
I think Jared and I may be able
to dig up an answer quicker.

03:56.481 --> 03:57.781
Great. Get on it.

05:01.645 --> 05:03.595
Come up with anything?

05:04.316 --> 05:06.415
Neither did I.

05:07.152 --> 05:10.820
I had a friend,
a neurosurgeon, at SF Muni.

05:10.822 --> 05:12.655
She looked at the scans.

05:12.657 --> 05:15.658
She came to the same diagnosis, Shaun.

05:15.660 --> 05:18.328
I have an inoperable glioma.

05:18.330 --> 05:20.350
Okay?

05:31.342 --> 05:33.543
I think you should go back to work, yes?

05:38.050 --> 05:40.550
I need to go to work.

05:47.224 --> 05:48.491
Be reasonable.

05:48.493 --> 05:49.859
Beg your pardon?

05:49.861 --> 05:51.361
Be reasonable.

05:51.363 --> 05:52.862
I have no idea what you're talking about.

05:52.864 --> 05:54.030
It'll be clear.

05:54.032 --> 05:55.532
What the hell happened to Caden?

05:55.534 --> 05:57.200
- I... I don't know.
- He twisted his ankle. I...

05:57.202 --> 05:58.368
You lied to me before.

05:58.370 --> 06:00.036
You're lying to me now,
you spoiled little coward.

06:00.038 --> 06:02.372
Hey, hey. Be reasonable.

06:02.374 --> 06:03.973
His friend's hurt.

06:03.975 --> 06:06.057
He's scared,
and you're freaking him out.

06:16.655 --> 06:19.022
He's angry, but he's not wrong.

06:19.024 --> 06:22.325
Caden's in bad shape,
and we don't know why.

06:22.327 --> 06:24.561
We need to know what happened.

06:26.330 --> 06:28.665
No, no, don't...
don't worry about him.

06:28.667 --> 06:30.166
Talk to me.

06:30.168 --> 06:32.168
You tell me the truth.

06:32.170 --> 06:35.538
You won't get in trouble.
You'll just... help a friend.

06:36.674 --> 06:38.508
All right.

06:39.090 --> 06:40.510
We were pledging.

06:40.512 --> 06:43.346
And there's... there's this,
wheel of torture thing

06:43.348 --> 06:45.148
you got to do for initiation.

06:45.150 --> 06:46.382
Torture?

06:46.384 --> 06:48.351
- But it's mos...
- it's mostly stupid stuff, dude.

06:48.353 --> 06:50.854
It's, like, like,
drink a cup of olive oil

06:50.856 --> 06:53.323
or eat a tablespoon of cinnamon.

06:53.325 --> 06:54.791
And what did Caden land on?

06:54.793 --> 06:56.025
Laundry.

06:56.027 --> 06:57.215
He had to do laundry?

06:57.217 --> 07:01.798
No, like, like, he had to,
eat ththose laundry things,

07:01.800 --> 07:04.167
as many as he could in 30 seconds.

07:04.169 --> 07:05.969
Detergent? Eat detergent?

07:05.971 --> 07:07.770
And how many did he have?

07:07.772 --> 07:10.540
- I don't know.
- Like six, maybe seven, seven.

07:11.543 --> 07:12.950
He ate detergent.

07:12.952 --> 07:14.978
Could've burned a hole
through his esophagus

07:14.980 --> 07:17.113
or his stomach and intestines.

07:22.157 --> 07:23.323
Catch that bleeder, please.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.859
Let's hope he doesn't breed.

07:27.363 --> 07:29.162
What? He <i>isn't</i> an idiot?

07:29.164 --> 07:31.131
<b></font></b> We have healthy bowel
attached to healthy bowel.

07:31.133 --> 07:32.799
Let's close him up.

07:32.801 --> 07:34.167
Dr. Melendez?

07:34.169 --> 07:36.002
The trauma S.O.D. is asking
for you in O.R. number 2.

07:36.004 --> 07:37.637
We got an emergency thoracotomy.

07:37.639 --> 07:39.606
Who can give me
the remaining steps for closing?

07:39.608 --> 07:41.975
<b></font></b> Cut anchoring sutures, clear
laps, and reposition the bowel.

07:41.977 --> 07:43.810
Remove clamps from
the duodenal resection site,

07:43.812 --> 07:45.345
keeping clear of the underlying aorta,

07:45.347 --> 07:47.214
close the fascia
using a looped O monofilament,

07:47.216 --> 07:49.577
close the dermal layer,
then reapproximate the skin.

07:51.279 --> 07:54.654
Also, you need to ensure
no omentum is caught

07:54.656 --> 07:56.390
in the fascial suture line.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.658
Close him up.

07:59.129 --> 08:00.861
Murphy, you're lead.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.166
Clearing laps.

08:08.704 --> 08:11.605
I will hold the repaired segment in place

08:11.607 --> 08:15.142
while you run the bowel for me.

08:20.549 --> 08:23.850
Bowel is clear
and ready to be repositioned.

08:27.389 --> 08:29.389
Shaun?

08:31.193 --> 08:32.888
Shaun, is everything all right?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.530
I lost something.

08:36.532 --> 08:37.664
In the cavity?

08:37.666 --> 08:39.065
No.

08:39.067 --> 08:41.368
But I know where it is now.

08:53.281 --> 08:54.981
Shaun.

08:54.983 --> 08:58.485
I left my scalpel here earlier today.

08:58.487 --> 09:01.922
You should get Diffusion Tensor Imaging.

09:03.759 --> 09:09.463
Masses are difficult
to diagnose accurately.

09:12.600 --> 09:15.469
You should get more imaging.

09:17.165 --> 09:18.438
People make mistakes.

09:18.440 --> 09:20.273
That's not gonna happen, Shaun.

09:23.277 --> 09:25.840
My scalpel isn't here.

09:36.641 --> 09:38.019
What happened this time?

09:38.021 --> 09:39.259
He's got a bleed somewhere.

09:39.261 --> 09:40.961
I want a capsule endoscopy to check

09:40.963 --> 09:42.796
the entire length of the bowel
for bleeding and leaks.

09:42.798 --> 09:44.130
And get me a complete coagulation

09:44.132 --> 09:46.600
- and metabolic profile.
- On it.

09:54.308 --> 09:56.510
Dr. Glassman is dying.

09:56.512 --> 09:58.178
What?

09:59.814 --> 10:02.015
What do you mean? He seemed fine.

10:02.017 --> 10:05.986
They say he has a glioma.

10:05.988 --> 10:08.154
That's a brain tumor.

10:08.156 --> 10:12.325
And he won't do a DTI scan
to confirm the diagnosis.

10:12.327 --> 10:13.760
Did he get a second opinion?

10:13.762 --> 10:18.832
He has, but delayed or missed
or incorrect diagnosis

10:18.834 --> 10:21.801
has an occurrence rate of 10% to 20%.

10:21.803 --> 10:23.603
Doctors make mistakes.

10:23.605 --> 10:25.248
Shaun, I don't know
what you want me to do.

10:25.272 --> 10:28.065
II want you to sit down.

10:29.612 --> 10:31.314
That's what people say

10:31.316 --> 10:35.415
when they want to tell you
something important.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.534
The part about him dying,

10:39.536 --> 10:41.288
that wasn't the important part?

10:49.030 --> 10:51.231
He won't listen to me.

10:51.233 --> 10:52.699
He is stubborn.

10:52.701 --> 10:54.200
- That he is.
- Stubborn.

10:54.202 --> 10:56.014
He <i>will</i> listen to you.

10:57.056 --> 10:59.706
Okay, you have known him longer,

10:59.708 --> 11:02.642
you're his friend, he trusts you.

11:02.644 --> 11:04.477
Shaun, I can't make him
do anything, either.

11:04.479 --> 11:06.980
You... YYou're an attorney.

11:06.982 --> 11:10.317
I'm not skilled at
lying or manipulation.

11:11.987 --> 11:14.032
So you want me to what?

11:15.657 --> 11:17.785
You want me to manipulate him?

11:19.078 --> 11:20.994
You want me to use our relationship

11:20.996 --> 11:25.165
and our history
to trick him into doing this?

11:27.169 --> 11:29.336
Yes, please.

11:35.344 --> 11:38.211
I knew you wouldn't let him die.

11:40.215 --> 11:43.783
Our patient has Disseminated
Intravascular Coagulation.

11:43.785 --> 11:45.719
Can anyone tell me
why that is very bad?

11:45.721 --> 11:47.854
Blood clots form
throughout the blood vessels

11:47.856 --> 11:49.956
and rapidly deplete
the body's clotting factors,

11:49.958 --> 11:51.558
thereby causing a systematic bleed.

11:51.560 --> 11:53.026
It's also a catch22.

11:53.028 --> 11:54.527
If we treat the clotting,

11:54.529 --> 11:56.396
he might end up with
a terminal bleed.

11:56.398 --> 11:58.632
And if we treat the bleeding,
he'll have a terminal clot.

11:58.634 --> 11:59.699
So how do we treat it?

11:59.701 --> 12:01.267
We figure out the cause.
Treat the cause.

12:01.269 --> 12:03.036
More damage from the detergent?

12:03.038 --> 12:04.471
Margins were clear.
It's not that.

12:04.473 --> 12:06.239
He could have a crush injury
from his ankle.

12:06.241 --> 12:08.847
Or a bacterial infection he picked
up before or during surgery.

12:08.849 --> 12:10.710
It might have been set off
by drug use.

12:10.712 --> 12:12.215
Or we did this to him.

12:14.926 --> 12:16.816
And by "we," I mean Shaun.

12:17.512 --> 12:19.953
He spaced out in the O.R.
when he was closing,

12:19.955 --> 12:21.454
kind of like he is now.

12:21.456 --> 12:23.590
- I'm listening.
- Comforting.

12:23.592 --> 12:24.791
He wasn't focused.

12:24.793 --> 12:26.292
He could've nicked a vessel,
which could've caused...

12:26.294 --> 12:27.594
Okay, we're talking about Shaun.

12:27.596 --> 12:31.331
Yeah, he's quiet,
but he was focused.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.499
He's always focused.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.833
His stitches look like

12:33.835 --> 12:35.602
they came out of a sewing machine.

12:36.823 --> 12:38.338
All right. Complications happen.

12:38.340 --> 12:40.607
The kid was in pretty bad shape
when we got him.

12:40.609 --> 12:43.610
Physician error is way down
on the list of likely causes.

12:43.612 --> 12:45.111
Crush trauma being top.

12:45.113 --> 12:48.710
Get him started on fresh frozen
plasma and crystalloid fluids.

12:55.257 --> 12:56.790
Yeah?</font></b>

12:56.792 --> 12:58.692
You got a second?

12:58.694 --> 13:01.294
Well, that's an open question.

13:01.296 --> 13:03.596
What can I do for you?

13:03.598 --> 13:06.132
I got a patient with DIC.

13:06.134 --> 13:08.835
One of the possible causes
is surgeon error.

13:08.837 --> 13:10.470
Your patient, your error?

13:10.472 --> 13:12.138
Shaun's.

13:12.140 --> 13:15.475
He got distracted
during surgery, spaced out.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.477
It's not like him.

13:17.479 --> 13:19.949
One place he never misses a beat
is the O.R.

13:21.284 --> 13:23.450
Is there anything going on
that I should know about?

13:27.081 --> 13:28.722
He got some bad news.

13:28.724 --> 13:29.823
About what?

13:30.209 --> 13:32.459
It's a personal matter.

13:32.461 --> 13:37.197
Shaun was distracted by
a personal issue?

13:38.342 --> 13:39.866
What, did Lea come back?

13:41.535 --> 13:43.403
She have a new boyfriend?

13:43.405 --> 13:45.138
His cable get cut off?

13:46.309 --> 13:48.708
I have an inoperable glioma.

13:50.188 --> 13:52.011
18 months.

13:57.686 --> 13:59.819
Aaron, I am so sorry.

14:00.698 --> 14:02.255
Me, too.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.192
Is there anything I can do?

14:06.913 --> 14:08.661
I wish.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.105
You should've told me.

14:16.271 --> 14:18.243
Or at least you shouldn't have told him.

14:35.190 --> 14:37.383
His coagulation factors are still off.

14:37.430 --> 14:38.462
Crush trauma isn't the issue.

14:38.464 --> 14:40.029
And his tox screen came back clean.

14:40.031 --> 14:42.312
- It's not drugs, either.
- We don't know that.

14:42.337 --> 14:43.803
He's had so many transfusions,

14:43.805 --> 14:45.972
the blood in his veins isn't
the same blood he came in with.

14:45.974 --> 14:47.773
The drugs could still be
in his organs causing...

14:47.775 --> 14:48.975
I get that you don't want to think

14:48.977 --> 14:50.610
that this could be caused by your friend,

14:50.612 --> 14:52.845
but we have to... The kid came
directly from a frat hazing, hammered.

14:52.847 --> 14:54.814
What are the odds
he <i>wasn't</i> on drugs?

14:54.816 --> 14:56.382
We should start IV midazolam

14:56.384 --> 14:57.984
and sodium bicarbonate to counteract...

14:57.986 --> 15:00.353
- That's the treatment for amphetamines.
- If you're wrong,

15:00.355 --> 15:01.854
that could cause a fatal arrhythmia.

15:01.856 --> 15:04.290
I'll find out what drugs he's on.

15:08.824 --> 15:09.996
You're going to find out by asking?

15:09.998 --> 15:11.497
Blake was honest with me before.

15:11.499 --> 15:12.832
It's a lot easier to be honest

15:12.834 --> 15:14.300
when you're not confessing to a crime.

15:14.302 --> 15:16.202
We don't have a lot of choice
in the matter.

15:17.705 --> 15:19.839
That's not true.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.776
Thanks for doing this.

15:24.532 --> 15:25.845
Yeah, no worries.

15:27.273 --> 15:29.181
Noticed it was cut when I first saw you.

15:29.183 --> 15:31.217
Figured it should get cleaned up.

15:33.249 --> 15:34.966
Is it all right if I draw some blood?

15:34.991 --> 15:36.149
Just want to make sure

15:36.151 --> 15:37.643
you don't have any toxins or infections.

15:37.645 --> 15:38.921
Sure.

15:41.429 --> 15:47.033
So, the nurse said
that Caden has DIC.

15:47.737 --> 15:49.237
Do you know what that is?

15:49.239 --> 15:50.405
Mnhmnh.

15:50.407 --> 15:52.274
Well, in short, his body is clotting

15:52.276 --> 15:53.809
and hemorrhaging at the same time.

15:53.811 --> 15:55.610
If we can't figure out what's causing it,

15:55.612 --> 15:57.023
he'll die.

16:02.278 --> 16:04.405
Just hold that there for me.

16:05.389 --> 16:06.824
All done.

16:09.243 --> 16:11.059
<b></font></b> Blake, buddy, you're on something.

16:11.061 --> 16:12.427
Your pupils are dilated,

16:12.429 --> 16:14.296
and you're sweating in a 68degree room.

16:14.298 --> 16:16.064
Now, I can hand this over to the cops

16:16.066 --> 16:18.733
or you can tell the truth
about what Caden's on.

16:20.659 --> 16:21.837
Molly.

16:24.975 --> 16:27.409
I would've told you the truth
if you'd asked.

16:29.343 --> 16:30.912
I'm sorry.

16:32.415 --> 16:34.416
You have time to talk?

16:36.854 --> 16:38.086
Shaun told you.

16:38.088 --> 16:39.621
He did. Yeah.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.670
I wish I would've heard it from you.

16:41.672 --> 16:43.525
Yeah, I'm sorry.

16:43.527 --> 16:45.360
- We're friends.
- I get it.

16:45.362 --> 16:47.429
- I want to be there for you.
- What, are you mad at me?

16:47.431 --> 16:49.097
Yes.

16:49.099 --> 16:51.199
I'm supposed to be there for you.

16:51.201 --> 16:53.368
To do what? To do what exactly?
Hold my hand?

16:53.370 --> 16:54.870
Yes, if that's what's needed.

16:54.872 --> 16:57.239
Okay, well, what I need
is to be left alone, okay?

16:57.241 --> 16:58.440
Well, you told Shaun,

16:58.442 --> 17:00.709
so that was a brilliant strategy.

17:00.711 --> 17:02.077
Okay, okay, I get it.

17:02.079 --> 17:04.212
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, okay?

17:04.214 --> 17:06.381
Sometimes when people
are told they are dying,

17:06.383 --> 17:07.549
they do stupid things!

17:07.550 --> 17:10.385
Sometimes people around them
do stupid things!

17:10.387 --> 17:12.053
Shaun told you to come here

17:12.055 --> 17:15.857
to try to convince me
to get more imaging, right?!

17:16.893 --> 17:18.604
Aaron, you can't stop fighting.

17:21.530 --> 17:26.233
- Maddie wouldn't have wanted you to stop.
- Don't, don't, don't, don't you dare.

17:26.612 --> 17:28.336
Don't you dare.

17:31.117 --> 17:33.742
What are you gonna say?

17:33.744 --> 17:35.977
That Maddie was a fighter?

17:38.415 --> 17:40.001
That she never quit?

17:48.257 --> 17:49.501
I'm sorry.

17:53.497 --> 17:55.164
Thank you.

17:58.702 --> 18:01.569
And you should get the DTI.

18:03.573 --> 18:05.573
Not for you.

18:05.575 --> 18:09.377
You've accepted your diagnosis.

18:09.864 --> 18:11.446
Shaun hasn't.

18:14.451 --> 18:17.085
He needs to.

18:21.625 --> 18:22.924
<b></font></b> Hey, Neil.

18:22.926 --> 18:25.560
I heard there was a complication
in one of your cases.

18:25.562 --> 18:26.895
Caden Hauley?

18:26.897 --> 18:28.730
<b></font></b> Heard or
have you been monitoring

18:28.732 --> 18:30.065
all of Murphy's cases?

18:30.067 --> 18:32.067
I monitor all my department's cases.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.735
18yearold with DIC.

18:33.737 --> 18:35.236
Any idea what set it off?

18:35.238 --> 18:36.932
Complications happen.

18:37.407 --> 18:40.275
The kid was in pretty bad shape
when he got to us.

18:40.277 --> 18:43.511
I'm also wondering why you were
in two surgeries at once.

18:43.513 --> 18:45.847
You left three firstyears unattended?

18:47.383 --> 18:49.217
You know we do this all the time.

18:49.219 --> 18:51.619
We couldn't function efficiently
if we didn't.

18:53.422 --> 18:56.291
I hope Caden pulls through.

19:02.832 --> 19:06.001
You got a very quick appointment.

19:06.003 --> 19:09.048
I have connections, Shaun.

19:09.539 --> 19:13.041
Why did you listen to Jessica but not me?

19:13.594 --> 19:15.377
Well, Jessica's pretty smart, too.

19:15.379 --> 19:18.146
Yes, but what did she tell you?

19:18.935 --> 19:20.548
I don't think this is a good time.

19:20.550 --> 19:22.417
When is a good time?

19:23.719 --> 19:25.754
I have a lot to learn from you,

19:25.756 --> 19:28.456
and if you're dying,
less than two years to learn.

19:31.862 --> 19:33.895
Sorry to keep you waiting.

19:33.897 --> 19:36.831
There were some surprises on your images.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.401
The previous diagnosis was incorrect.

19:39.403 --> 19:41.903
You have a Glioblastoma Multiforme

19:41.905 --> 19:44.072
located in your pons.

19:44.074 --> 19:46.408
I'm sure I don't need to tell you this,

19:46.410 --> 19:50.172
but it's the most aggressive
form of brain cancer.

19:50.747 --> 19:56.584
We estimate three, maybe four months.

19:56.586 --> 20:00.088
I can have my assistant
get in touch with you

20:00.090 --> 20:03.425
to refer you to a therapist
when you're ready.

20:11.115 --> 20:12.482
He still has low blood pressure
and thin blood,

20:12.484 --> 20:15.551
which means the treatment
for the MDMA didn't work.

20:15.589 --> 20:17.022
So the Molly wasn't the problem?

20:17.024 --> 20:19.325
It certainly didn't help him,
but now we think he...

20:19.327 --> 20:21.860
Our best guess is
Caden has a bacterial infection.

20:23.531 --> 20:25.698
Thanks.

20:30.504 --> 20:32.604
What happened there?

20:32.606 --> 20:34.506
We're not sure yet.

20:34.508 --> 20:36.642
He was pretty sick when he came in.

20:36.644 --> 20:39.178
I guess sometimes
complications just happen.

20:39.180 --> 20:40.512
Interesting choice of words.

20:40.514 --> 20:43.282
Eerily similar
to what Dr. Melendez said to me.

20:43.284 --> 20:45.684
Yeah, he said it during a differential.

20:45.686 --> 20:47.519
I guess the phrasing just stuck with me.

20:47.521 --> 20:49.621
It's not like Melendez
to be that laissezfaire.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.857
He usually likes to know
exactly why things happen.

20:51.859 --> 20:53.759
One of the traits I admire about him.

20:53.761 --> 20:55.861
Yeah, well,
we're trying to figure it out.

20:55.863 --> 20:58.030
But so far, the cultures are negative.

20:58.032 --> 20:59.732
Shaun's closing was textbook.

20:59.734 --> 21:01.867
Drug use doesn't seem to be a problem.

21:02.936 --> 21:05.471
I didn't realize Murphy did the closing.

21:05.473 --> 21:06.638
Good for him.

21:27.827 --> 21:29.962
My God.

21:29.964 --> 21:31.163
Shaun.

21:31.165 --> 21:34.500
Yes, yes, there are
many different explanations.

21:34.502 --> 21:37.836
You asked me to get a second opinion.
I got a second opinion.

21:37.838 --> 21:40.506
You asked me to get more imaging.
I got more imaging.

21:40.508 --> 21:42.007
Shaun, you have to accept...

21:42.009 --> 21:43.675
No, I don't accept.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.878
I don't accept. I was right.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.946
No, you were not right.
I'm dying, Shaun.

21:47.948 --> 21:50.115
- I said - doctors make mistakes...
- Yeah, they made a mistake.

21:50.117 --> 21:52.518
- I have less time than we even thought!
- And they made a mistake.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.019
Shaun was right.
Shaun was right.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.854
Imaging is unreliable.

21:55.856 --> 21:57.689
The imaging that you asked me to get.

21:57.691 --> 22:00.459
Imaging is subject to interpretation.

22:01.562 --> 22:04.129
Yes, studies have shown that
experts rely

22:04.131 --> 22:06.965
on... on...
on subjective measures

22:06.967 --> 22:09.001
based on experience
rather than object...

22:09.003 --> 22:10.068
No more.

22:10.070 --> 22:11.437
Rather than objective...
No more, no.

22:11.439 --> 22:12.704
- No.
- No, no. No more. No more.

22:12.706 --> 22:15.007
- No more.
- Many theories consistent with...

22:15.009 --> 22:16.775
You can't do a biopsy to confirm

22:16.777 --> 22:18.477
because many tumors look alike.

22:18.479 --> 22:20.012
Some are treatable.

22:20.014 --> 22:22.300
- Some are curable.
- Stop, will ya?!

22:22.302 --> 22:23.949
Some are curable.
They're curable.

22:23.951 --> 22:26.652
Stop, please, will ya?!
Stop, stop, stop talking!

22:26.654 --> 22:28.153
- Stop!
- Okay.

22:28.155 --> 22:29.790
Stop!

22:33.168 --> 22:35.727
I am not hurting you.

22:35.729 --> 22:38.030
My God, stop.

22:38.032 --> 22:39.498
I'm helping you.

22:39.500 --> 22:42.000
No, you're not.
You're not helping.

22:42.002 --> 22:44.336
I don't need theories.

22:44.847 --> 22:46.672
I don't need white boards.

22:46.674 --> 22:48.040
I don't need doctors!

22:48.684 --> 22:51.510
I don't want to think about the tumor!

22:51.512 --> 22:53.679
I don't want to think about dying!

22:53.681 --> 22:55.180
You know what I want?

22:55.182 --> 22:57.449
You know what I actually want?
I want to... I want to...

22:57.451 --> 22:59.117
I want to go on
a long drive somewhere.

22:59.119 --> 23:00.786
I want to...
I want to eat pancakes.

23:00.788 --> 23:02.554
I want to watch football.

23:02.556 --> 23:04.857
- It's not football season.
- My God.

23:04.859 --> 23:07.202
I know it's not football season.

23:09.964 --> 23:12.764
Do you mean you want to have fun?

23:17.304 --> 23:19.304
Yeah.

23:19.306 --> 23:21.473
I want to have fun.

23:24.478 --> 23:27.412
So you can keep fighting.

23:27.414 --> 23:29.183
Keep fighting if you want.

23:30.451 --> 23:33.652
It's futile and it's stupid.

23:36.657 --> 23:38.409
Or you can come with me.

24:03.516 --> 24:05.117
<b><font color="#0080C0">How long has he been hypoxic?

24:05.119 --> 24:06.618
It came on suddenly five minutes ago.

24:06.620 --> 24:09.288
He's on 100% highflow oxygen,
and his numbers aren't budging.

24:09.290 --> 24:10.789
He's ventilating fine.

24:11.308 --> 24:13.292
He must have thrombosed
his pulmonary artery.

24:13.294 --> 24:15.594
We need to dissolve this clot
before his heart stops.

24:15.596 --> 24:17.129
- Jared, prep for jugular access.
- On it.

24:17.131 --> 24:18.697
50 milligrams T.P.A. infusion now.

24:18.699 --> 24:21.099
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

24:24.471 --> 24:26.638
Is this fun?

24:29.143 --> 24:32.477
The Saturday after Valentine's Day,

24:32.479 --> 24:34.313
her favorite day of the year,

24:34.315 --> 24:35.847
even more than her birthday.

24:35.849 --> 24:40.185
The Chamber of Commerce
would decorate this place

24:40.187 --> 24:43.322
and put out a crappy buffet meal,

24:43.324 --> 24:47.326
hire a deejay, and I'd put on a tux,

24:47.328 --> 24:50.662
and she'd put on a yellow Belle dress,

24:50.664 --> 24:52.140
and she'd...

24:52.967 --> 24:56.501
pin my bow tie on me,

24:56.503 --> 25:00.772
and I'd pin a little
yellow corsage on her.

25:00.774 --> 25:05.944
And we'd come and we'd eat
and we'd... and we'd dance.

25:18.792 --> 25:20.325
I love you, sweetie.

25:20.327 --> 25:22.861
I love you more.

25:22.863 --> 25:24.496
You think so?

25:24.498 --> 25:26.231
Well, I'll tell you what.

25:26.233 --> 25:28.634
You can take how much you love me,

25:28.636 --> 25:30.702
which I know is quite a lot,

25:30.704 --> 25:34.139
and then you can double it,
and then you can add 10,

25:34.141 --> 25:36.174
and that's how much I love you.

25:39.480 --> 25:42.948
I love you more.

25:51.575 --> 25:57.329
And I remember thinking,
"This is the moment..."

25:58.373 --> 26:00.599
that I know will be in my mind

26:00.601 --> 26:05.470
"when I... when I...
when I close my eyes to die."

26:09.776 --> 26:11.943
Only I thought
that she'd be sitting there,

26:11.945 --> 26:13.597
right next to me,

26:15.282 --> 26:18.018
and I'd hear her say it
one more time.

26:24.090 --> 26:26.992
I lost my toy scalpel.

26:29.462 --> 26:31.830
The one that Steve gave me.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.635
Yeah, I figured that was the one.

26:36.637 --> 26:39.581
I have been looking for a whole day.

26:40.140 --> 26:43.008
I think it may be gone forever.

26:48.981 --> 26:51.850
Maybe I'll come here
when you're dead.

26:53.319 --> 26:55.097
Okay.

26:59.092 --> 27:02.260
Are your memories
of your daughter enough for you?

27:04.764 --> 27:06.817
Not even close.

27:15.374 --> 27:17.275
Do you need me to listen to you anymore?

27:17.277 --> 27:18.610
No, Shaun, you should go.

27:18.612 --> 27:19.811
Okay.

27:29.155 --> 27:30.719
<b></font></b> Not all the cultures are back.

27:30.721 --> 27:32.751
But since he's not responding
to any antibiotics,

27:32.776 --> 27:34.109
we can rule out bacterial.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.143
It was never a great fit.

27:35.145 --> 27:36.876
It's a better fit than surgical error.

27:36.878 --> 27:39.363
What if it is bacterial
but resistant to all...

27:39.397 --> 27:40.417
Then he's dead.

27:40.419 --> 27:42.939
What about Paroxysmal Nocturnal
Hemoglobinuria?

27:44.008 --> 27:45.708
The incidence
is literally one in a million.

27:45.710 --> 27:47.777
What's the odds of Murphy screwing up?

27:47.779 --> 27:50.168
- I'd put them about that.
- No, it's not PNH.

27:50.170 --> 27:51.741
Caden had normal flow cytometry.

27:51.743 --> 27:55.251
Exotic snake venom can trigger
consumptive coagulopathies.

27:55.253 --> 27:56.586
So can preeclampsia,

27:56.588 --> 27:58.688
but he's not pregnant
and he wasn't charming snakes.

28:01.462 --> 28:04.527
Murphy, any thoughts here?

28:05.041 --> 28:07.029
It is kind of your ass on the line.

28:26.644 --> 28:29.746
I know why Caden has DIC.

28:31.622 --> 28:35.558
I squeezed the artery between two clamps.

28:35.560 --> 28:38.052
I must have ruptured the aortic wall,

28:38.054 --> 28:40.107
causing a pseudoaneurysm.

28:40.109 --> 28:42.131
It was my mistake.

28:43.367 --> 28:45.332
And also...

28:47.417 --> 28:50.773
I have to make a bowel movement.

28:56.885 --> 28:58.181
He's lying.

28:58.762 --> 29:00.016
He's gonna puke.

29:01.486 --> 29:04.020
He's going to Glassman.

29:06.703 --> 29:11.002
I told Dr. Melendez
I had to make a bowel movement.

29:11.029 --> 29:13.362
I think he believed me.

29:13.364 --> 29:14.557
Color me proud.

29:14.559 --> 29:17.200
I have the answer.

29:17.202 --> 29:19.535
Shaun, I hope you're referring
to your patient,

29:19.537 --> 29:21.037
but due to the fact that you're here,

29:21.039 --> 29:22.705
pretending to be in the bathroom,

29:22.707 --> 29:24.874
- I kind of doubt that.
- Yes, it's your answer.

29:24.876 --> 29:26.375
We already...

29:26.377 --> 29:29.245
We already have my answer, Shaun.

29:29.247 --> 29:31.714
We can't do a biopsy on you

29:31.716 --> 29:33.649
because of the arteries in the way,

29:33.651 --> 29:36.219
like the arteries in Caden's abdomen,

29:36.221 --> 29:38.372
but we can't move the arteries
in your brain because...

29:38.374 --> 29:41.390
Why did we go to the carousel?

29:41.392 --> 29:43.459
Because you were sad.

29:43.461 --> 29:45.494
What didn't I want to do?

29:46.563 --> 29:49.065
Do you not know the answers
to these questions?

29:49.067 --> 29:50.574
I <i>do</i> know the answers, Shaun.

29:50.576 --> 29:52.579
I don't think <i>you</i> know
the answers to these questions.

29:52.581 --> 29:55.037
You're not hearing me. I'm dying.

29:55.039 --> 29:56.319
There's still hope.

29:57.445 --> 29:59.531
Shaun, look at me.

30:00.448 --> 30:02.178
Look at me, please.

30:05.034 --> 30:07.903
There is no hope for me.

30:08.832 --> 30:09.919
I mean, hope?

30:09.921 --> 30:11.782
What... What... What... What is hope?

30:11.784 --> 30:14.257
You hope the 49ers find a defense.

30:14.259 --> 30:16.926
You hope the number 4 bus comes on time.

30:16.928 --> 30:19.095
Doesn't mean they magically
learn how to tackle.

30:19.097 --> 30:22.220
Doesn't mean the bus driver
suddenly drives faster.

30:23.434 --> 30:27.103
Hope is irrelevant for me.

30:27.105 --> 30:30.273
Hope is painful.

30:30.812 --> 30:34.277
I don't want to spend
what's left of my life

30:34.279 --> 30:37.152
chasing my tail around in a circle.

30:38.877 --> 30:40.777
You understand?

30:46.624 --> 30:48.204
Okay.

30:50.749 --> 30:52.495
Okay.

31:06.243 --> 31:10.226
Your tumor is located
at the base of your skull.

31:10.982 --> 31:15.918
An open cranial biopsy
would tell us what's wrong.

31:15.920 --> 31:18.421
But there are blood vessels in the way.

31:18.423 --> 31:22.072
The biopsy would cause
an aneurysm or a bleed.

31:22.593 --> 31:26.429
But if we go through
your nasal cribriform plate,

31:26.431 --> 31:30.099
we can cross the tentorium
on the contralateral side

31:30.101 --> 31:32.499
and avoid all those blood vessels.

31:34.605 --> 31:38.569
We can do a biopsy through your nose.

31:46.383 --> 31:48.791
You can't die, too.

31:56.127 --> 31:57.646
I have to throw up.

32:04.902 --> 32:06.869
<b></font></b> So how do we do this?
Do we file a report?

32:06.871 --> 32:08.165
Talk to Andrews personally?

32:08.167 --> 32:09.634
You want to report Shaun?

32:09.636 --> 32:12.441
I don't <i>want</i> to.
I think we <i>have to.</i>

32:12.443 --> 32:13.776
No, you <i>want</i> to.

32:13.778 --> 32:15.978
And we'd certainly have to
if our sole agenda

32:15.980 --> 32:17.413
would be to take down Shaun

32:17.415 --> 32:19.197
and to give you one less person
to compete against.

32:19.199 --> 32:21.212
And certainly, we'd absolutely "have to"

32:21.214 --> 32:24.420
cover up and bury
a possible fatal medical error

32:24.422 --> 32:26.622
if our sole agenda
was to protect a friend?

32:26.624 --> 32:29.725
Protocol would seem to favor
the bitch over the friend.

32:29.727 --> 32:30.793
Thanks?

32:32.697 --> 32:34.764
I threw up.

32:37.067 --> 32:38.934
We have a duty to report errors

32:38.936 --> 32:40.442
so they won't happen again.

32:40.838 --> 32:42.571
The process saves lives.

32:42.573 --> 32:45.040
And exactly what errors are
we trying to avoid a repeat of?

32:45.042 --> 32:47.510
You worried about the next time
an autistic surgeon operates

32:47.512 --> 32:48.811
on a druggedup frat kid

32:48.813 --> 32:50.933
after finding out his mentor
is dying of brain cancer?

32:53.817 --> 32:55.951
Dr. Melendez told us, Shaun.

32:55.953 --> 32:57.486
We're really sorry.

32:57.959 --> 32:59.755
It's okay.

33:00.336 --> 33:02.057
It's okay.

33:02.059 --> 33:04.727
I think he's going to be okay.

33:04.729 --> 33:06.562
The protocol exists

33:06.564 --> 33:08.230
so that we <i>don't ask
questions like that.</i>

33:08.232 --> 33:09.999
That seems like a bad idea.

33:10.001 --> 33:11.434
<i>You</i> trust <i>your</i> judgment.

33:11.436 --> 33:13.135
Do you trust <i>Morgan's</i> judgment?

33:13.137 --> 33:15.185
Do you trust the judgment of all
the doctors in this building?

33:15.187 --> 33:17.464
If you can make judgment calls,
so can they.

33:17.466 --> 33:19.018
That's why we need these rules.

33:19.020 --> 33:22.178
No, the protocol is fine
for everyone in this building,

33:22.180 --> 33:23.446
except for Shaun.

33:23.448 --> 33:26.315
They'd reprimand any one of us,
but they will fire him.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.150
Okay.

33:29.431 --> 33:30.920
We report it.

33:30.922 --> 33:33.870
We get the investigation, make sure
nothing like this ever happens again.

33:35.079 --> 33:36.592
But we tell them I did it.

33:37.668 --> 33:40.281
They'd fire you, too.

33:40.932 --> 33:43.165
<b></font></b> It's not a terrible idea.

33:43.167 --> 33:44.417
Jared's out the door either way.

33:44.419 --> 33:46.329
Can we get back to the medicine?

33:46.331 --> 33:47.770
Caden is still alive.

33:47.772 --> 33:49.171
If we can keep it that way,

33:49.173 --> 33:50.673
there won't be an M&M review.

33:50.675 --> 33:52.288
Which means no one
will be asking questions,

33:52.290 --> 33:53.685
and no one will have to give answers.

33:53.687 --> 33:54.944
It all goes away.

33:54.946 --> 33:57.446
If Caden dies, we tell the truth

33:57.448 --> 33:59.729
and we face the consequences together.

34:00.404 --> 34:01.970
<b></font></b> No.

34:02.607 --> 34:04.317
No.

34:05.056 --> 34:09.658
I thought I'd found my toy scalpel.

34:11.699 --> 34:14.029
We need you to come back
to the group, Murphy.

34:17.259 --> 34:19.627
Get me imaging on that pseudoaneurysm.

34:31.949 --> 34:33.148
Hey. What's up?

34:33.150 --> 34:35.150
Do you still feel
the same way about Dr. Murphy

34:35.152 --> 34:36.185
as when he got here?

34:37.855 --> 34:43.391
Dr. Glassman gave us certain...
assurances.

34:45.396 --> 34:47.563
"If Shaun proves
anything less than excellent,"

34:47.565 --> 34:49.797
if Shaun doesn't live up
to everything I know he can do,

34:49.800 --> 34:51.233
he will be immediately released,

34:51.235 --> 34:53.002
and I will resign my position

34:53.004 --> 34:54.803
"as president of the hospital."

34:54.804 --> 34:56.739
And you wrote it down.

34:56.741 --> 34:58.574
I made sure it was in the minutes.

34:58.576 --> 35:01.076
Shaun has exceeded my expectations.

35:01.078 --> 35:03.245
Mine, as well, and?

35:03.835 --> 35:07.383
And my feelings about
Dr. Glassman have not changed.

35:08.256 --> 35:10.052
Thank you.

35:15.092 --> 35:17.026
<b></font></b> We need to cut him open.

35:17.028 --> 35:18.994
<b></font></b> We cut him open and he dies.

35:18.996 --> 35:22.031
He'll bleed out before we
can even get the artery exposed.

35:22.033 --> 35:24.533
If we <i>don't</i> cut him open,
he dies.

35:26.537 --> 35:28.370
Don't cut him open.

35:28.372 --> 35:29.883
Murphy, if we don't...

35:29.885 --> 35:33.542
We should insert
an endovascular graft

35:33.544 --> 35:35.578
through his leg instead.

35:35.580 --> 35:37.780
Fix it from the inside out.

35:37.782 --> 35:40.049
I've done that for
large abdominal aorta dilations,

35:40.051 --> 35:42.751
but this is a lengthy
dissecting pseudoaneurysm.

35:42.753 --> 35:43.886
It's safer.

35:43.888 --> 35:45.387
The aortic wall is
already compromised.

35:45.389 --> 35:46.689
Could rupture completely.

35:46.691 --> 35:48.775
Caden could die
as soon as deflate the balloon

35:48.777 --> 35:51.293
- inside the graft.
- But doing nothing will kill him.

35:51.295 --> 35:52.494
Not definitely.

35:52.496 --> 35:55.064
There's still a chance Caden
will simply come out of this

35:55.066 --> 35:56.449
without any surgical intervention.

35:56.451 --> 35:57.886
5%, 10% maybe.

35:57.888 --> 35:59.368
<b></font></b> Not nothing.

35:59.370 --> 36:00.703
And we're doubling down on Shaun

36:00.705 --> 36:02.167
after we know he caused this problem.

36:02.169 --> 36:03.895
How's that gonna look at an M&M?

36:05.076 --> 36:07.009
I trust Shaun's idea.

36:07.523 --> 36:10.012
He makes mistakes
no one else would make,

36:10.014 --> 36:13.449
but he also makes saves none of
us would have ever thought of.

36:13.451 --> 36:15.373
Thank you.

36:15.374 --> 36:16.640
You're welcome.

36:16.642 --> 36:18.341
I still don't think
you should be working here.

36:18.343 --> 36:19.976
I don't think
the tradeoff is worth it.

36:21.829 --> 36:23.647
Well, let's prep him for surgery.

36:27.847 --> 36:29.947
Pull the guide wire, Reznick.

36:34.681 --> 36:36.220
I'm passing in the graft.

36:39.091 --> 36:41.625
You're right over
the pseudoaneurysm now.

36:53.672 --> 36:56.507
Inflating the balloon
to deploy the graft.

37:05.283 --> 37:06.650
Deflating.

37:06.652 --> 37:08.018
Can I do it?

37:09.794 --> 37:11.121
It's delicate.

37:11.123 --> 37:12.890
No, it's not.

37:14.659 --> 37:18.386
And it will either work
or it won't work.

37:19.554 --> 37:21.499
If my idea is wrong,

37:21.501 --> 37:25.135
he'll die as soon
as we complete this next step.

37:26.806 --> 37:30.007
You shouldn't have to live with that.

37:34.514 --> 37:37.715
Everything that happens in
this room is my responsibility.

37:41.256 --> 37:43.320
We'll do it together.

37:54.172 --> 37:55.533
Deflating.

38:22.761 --> 38:24.228
Nobody's going home.

38:25.997 --> 38:30.291
I am proud of this team
and what we accomplished today.

38:31.167 --> 38:33.203
Drinks are on me at Harry Hopes.

38:33.878 --> 38:35.673
We're celebrating?

38:35.675 --> 38:38.709
Today was a disaster,
and we got lucky.

38:39.467 --> 38:41.178
You're right.

38:41.180 --> 38:44.515
But when you get lucky,
you celebrate.

38:44.517 --> 38:45.783
Let's go.

39:00.404 --> 39:02.700
At some point in your career,

39:02.702 --> 39:04.268
you're going to kill someone.

39:05.471 --> 39:08.072
And I hope for your sake
there's a doctor out there

39:08.074 --> 39:10.107
who still believes in you
when you do.

39:25.012 --> 39:27.725
It was there all along.

39:27.727 --> 39:31.161
I have to go drinking,
but I wanted you to know...

39:33.832 --> 39:35.499
Is that from an IV?

39:38.104 --> 39:39.737
You did the biopsy.

39:40.486 --> 39:42.239
I did.

39:43.609 --> 39:46.076
I have a lowgrade glioma.

39:46.078 --> 39:47.778
Not a GBM?

39:47.780 --> 39:49.847
I told you...

39:49.849 --> 39:51.582
Cancer, Shaun. It's still cancer.

39:52.248 --> 39:54.018
I have to undergo brain surgery,

39:54.020 --> 39:55.352
which is really scary

39:55.354 --> 39:57.021
because I'm not the one
performing it.

39:57.023 --> 40:00.024
Five days a week
for six weeks of radiation,

40:00.026 --> 40:02.760
10 more weeks of chemotherapy.

40:02.762 --> 40:04.628
And then?

40:07.600 --> 40:09.700
And then...

40:09.702 --> 40:11.702
with a little luck...

40:11.704 --> 40:15.272
you and I can go
to the Super Bowl next season.

40:27.742 --> 40:29.687
You're going to live.

40:31.454 --> 40:33.123
There's hope.

40:36.128 --> 40:37.394
Now go.

40:37.396 --> 40:39.129
Go have some fun with your friends.

40:39.131 --> 40:43.300
Yes. First I have to tell Dr.
Andrews about the mistake I made.

40:43.302 --> 40:44.835
Shaun, yyou can't.

40:45.259 --> 40:49.506
Protocol is clear,
and reporting saves lives.

40:49.508 --> 40:52.076
And I hear Caden
is on the road to recovery,

40:52.078 --> 40:54.178
so your mistake
couldn't have been too bad.

40:54.180 --> 40:55.713
No, I made a mistake.

40:55.715 --> 40:57.214
Shaun, I understand that.

40:57.216 --> 40:59.216
But Dr. Andrews will use this.

40:59.218 --> 41:00.851
And do you remember the commitment

41:00.853 --> 41:02.986
that Dr. Glassman made
when you were hired?

41:02.988 --> 41:05.489
I promised you'd be excellent,
right, Shaun?

41:05.491 --> 41:07.328
And you <i>have been excellent.</i>

41:08.115 --> 41:12.696
You can't give Dr. Andrews this excuse.

41:12.698 --> 41:15.365
I was not excellent.

41:15.367 --> 41:17.568
This time, I was bad.

41:19.425 --> 41:23.207
And surgeons have to be
excellent every time.

41:23.209 --> 41:24.775
Right, Shaun?

41:25.424 --> 41:26.877
You agree with him?

41:26.879 --> 41:30.262
I'm not gonna ask him to lie
to save my job.

41:31.764 --> 41:33.307
Don't do this.

41:35.643 --> 41:37.054
It's up to Shaun.

41:37.812 --> 41:39.757
I trust your judgment.

41:45.820 --> 41:48.265
I'm not doing this to hurt you.

41:48.267 --> 41:50.067
I know.

41:50.069 --> 41:52.402
We are friends.

41:52.404 --> 41:54.120
Yes, we are.

41:54.774 --> 41:56.122
I love you.

41:57.009 --> 41:58.675
I know. I love you, too.

42:01.347 --> 42:02.978
I love you more.
