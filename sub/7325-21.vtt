WEBVTT

00:02.603 --> 00:06.237
(Zola Jesus' "Avalanche"
playing)

00:06.237 --> 00:11.082
(Miranda) INFECTIONS
ARE LIKE SLEEPING MONSTERS.

00:11.082 --> 00:14.145
YOU CAN'T SEE THEM.

00:16.317 --> 00:19.720
YOU CAN'T FEEL THEM.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.192
BUT...

00:21.192 --> 00:26.257
♪ IN THE END, I SAW YOU ♪

00:26.257 --> 00:31.362
YOU MUST DO EVERYTHING
IN YOUR POWER...

00:31.362 --> 00:33.364
TO CONTAIN THEM.

00:33.364 --> 00:36.207
♪ I WASN'T USED TO ♪

00:36.207 --> 00:38.639
BECAUSE WHEN THE MONSTERS
WAKE UP...

00:38.639 --> 00:45.176
♪ AND IT ALL GO ♪

00:45.176 --> 00:47.778
THEY'RE OUT OF CONTROL.

00:47.778 --> 00:55.156
♪ AND IT ALL GO ♪

00:56.127 --> 00:57.358
HEY.

00:57.358 --> 00:59.059
BAILEY,
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.361
HOW IS SETH LEPIK?

01:00.361 --> 01:02.062
THE COMPUTER SAYS
ACCESS RESTRICTED.

01:02.062 --> 01:04.195
THEY WON'T EVEN LET ME
CHECK ON MY OWN PATIENTS.

01:04.195 --> 01:05.696
THEY SWABBED MY NOSE.

01:05.696 --> 01:07.168
THEY'RE SWABBING
EVERYONE'S NOSES.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.140
WELL, ARE THEY SITTING
EVERYBODY DOWN FOR INTERVIEWS?

01:09.140 --> 01:11.071
'CAUSE THEY THINK
I DID SOMETHING WRONG.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.543
NOW I THINK IT'S THE GRAFTS.

01:12.543 --> 01:14.645
I NARROWED IT DOWN TO--
LOOK, BAILEY,

01:14.645 --> 01:16.347
THEY'VE ISOLATED THE STRAIN
OF STAPH IN YOUR PATIENTS.

01:16.347 --> 01:17.848
NOW THEY NEED TO FIND OUT
HOW IT SPREAD.

01:17.848 --> 01:20.111
YOUR JOB
IS TO COOPERATE.

01:20.111 --> 01:22.253
I'VE GOT SETH.
(mutters)

01:22.253 --> 01:25.486
NOW GO ANSWER
THEIR QUESTIONS.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.218
PLEASE.
MM.

01:27.218 --> 01:29.420
WE ARE THROWING BAILEY
UNDER THE BUS.

01:29.420 --> 01:32.193
COME ON. THAT IS NOT
WHAT WE'RE DOING.
NO, IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.465
TWO OF OUR PATIENTS ARE DEAD
OF THE SAME POST-OP INFECTION.

01:34.465 --> 01:36.797
A THIRD ONE'S BARELY HANGING ON.
IT WAS TIME.

01:36.797 --> 01:39.230
WE GET THE C.D.C. IN HERE
AND FIGURE THIS THING OUT.
(Meredith) BY TREATING BAILEY
LIKE A CRIMINAL?

01:39.230 --> 01:40.301
SHE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING.

01:40.301 --> 01:41.472
I HOPE THAT YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:41.472 --> 01:43.103
TRUTH IS,
WE DON'T KNOW THAT YET.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.405
C.D.C. IS SIMPLY ASKING US

01:44.405 --> 01:46.207
TO TEMPORARILY FREEZE
BAILEY'S FILES.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.508
OH, COME ON.

01:47.508 --> 01:48.739
AND THAT WE NOT DISCUSS
THIS INVESTIGATION WITH HER.

01:48.739 --> 01:50.241
SO TODAY,
JUST KEEP YOUR DISTANCE.

01:50.241 --> 01:51.542
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.

01:51.542 --> 01:53.214
ALSO I THINK NOW'S THE TIME
TO PUT OUT A STATEMENT.

01:53.214 --> 01:54.545
(Cristina, Callie, Meredith,
and Derek) NO, NO.

01:54.545 --> 01:56.187
(Arizona) NO. WHOA. WHOA.
ABOUT WHAT?

01:56.187 --> 01:57.888
I MEAN, WE DON'T EVEN KNOW

01:57.888 --> 01:59.290
IF BAILEY'S THE SOURCE
OF THIS THING.
IF ONE OF OURS IS AT FAULT

01:59.290 --> 02:00.621
AND WE JUST SIT ON
THIS INFORMATION,

02:00.621 --> 02:01.752
WE LOOK LIKE WE'RE TRYING
TO COVER SOMETHING UP.

02:01.752 --> 02:03.154
THE ONLY WAY
TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW

02:03.154 --> 02:04.895
THAT WE CAN BE OBJECTIVE
IS BY BEING TRANSPARENT.

02:04.895 --> 02:06.327
VOTE?
I'M JUST SAYING,

02:06.327 --> 02:08.128
PEOPLE SHOULD
LEARN THE NEWS FROM US.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.260
THERE'S NO NEWS.
OKAY, VOTE?

02:09.260 --> 02:10.431
THERE'S NO NEWS YET.

02:10.431 --> 02:12.503
VOTE. ALL IN FAVOR
OF NO PRESS RELEASE.

02:12.503 --> 02:16.267
OKAY. NO PRESS RELEASE.
NO STATEMENT. CLEAR?

02:17.438 --> 02:18.609
(thuds)
OH!

02:18.609 --> 02:19.840
WATCH IT, MEMBERS ONLY.

02:19.840 --> 02:21.442
PROMISE ME
YOU'LL BE NICE.

02:21.442 --> 02:23.214
THESE GUYS ARE TRYING
TO TAKE DOWN BAILEY.

02:23.214 --> 02:24.175
THEY DON'T DESERVE NICE.

02:24.175 --> 02:25.846
NO, NOT TO THE C.D.C.
TO JASON.

02:25.846 --> 02:27.378
I'M NICE TO JASON.

02:27.378 --> 02:28.819
TWO MINUTES AGO, YOU SAID,
(deepened voice) "HEY, I HAVE

02:28.819 --> 02:30.721
A SURGERY TODAY
WITH YOUR D-BAG BOYFRIEND."

02:30.721 --> 02:32.483
YEAH, BUT I SAID IT
WITH A SMILE.
(elevator bell dings)

02:32.483 --> 02:34.154
FINE. I WON'T CALL THE GUY
A D-BAG.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.886
AT LEAST NOT TO HIS FACE,
ANYWAY.

02:35.886 --> 02:37.488
I'M MOVING IN WITH HIM.

02:38.789 --> 02:40.661
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

02:40.661 --> 02:42.663
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.595
REALLY?
NO. I THINK THE GUY
IS A DOUCHE BAG

02:44.595 --> 02:46.297
WHO YOU'VE KNOWN
FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES,

02:46.297 --> 02:48.168
AND THAT MAKES YOU AN IDIOT
FOR MOVING IN WITH HIM.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.900
ALEX--

02:49.900 --> 02:52.343
I'LL BE NICE!

02:52.343 --> 02:53.604
I'M GONNA ROCK
THIS CORNER KICK.

02:53.604 --> 02:54.775
LATER, I PROMISE.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.207
RIGHT NOW I HAVE A SURPRISE
FOR YOU.

02:56.207 --> 02:57.648
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

02:57.648 --> 02:59.210
GRANDMA!

02:59.210 --> 03:00.511
OH.

03:00.511 --> 03:03.814
(crying) OH, ETHAN.

03:03.814 --> 03:05.356
AS YOU CAN SEE,

03:05.356 --> 03:06.457
THERE AREN'T ANY RESIDUAL
EFFECTS FROM THE SURGERY.

03:06.457 --> 03:08.259
SO... I CAN GO HOME?

03:08.259 --> 03:10.291
WELL, I'D LIKE TO KEEP AN EYE
ON YOU FOR ANOTHER FEW DAYS.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.523
WELL, WE CAN HANDLE
A FEW MORE DAYS. (chuckles)

03:12.523 --> 03:13.724
RIGHT, BUDDY?

03:13.724 --> 03:15.226
HEY, GRANDMA,
DO YOU WANT TO SEE DAD?

03:15.226 --> 03:16.727
I CAN TAKE YOU.

03:16.727 --> 03:18.529
OH, UH, IS THAT...

03:18.529 --> 03:20.301
CAN--CAN HE--
SURE, SURE.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.303
HE SEES HIS DAD EVERY DAY.
HE CHATS UP A STORM.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.974
HE TOLD HIM ALL ABOUT YOU
COMING TO VISIT.

03:23.974 --> 03:25.606
DAD'S STILL UNCONSCIOUS.

03:25.606 --> 03:26.937
THAT'S BECAUSE
HIS BRAIN IS RESTING.

03:26.937 --> 03:28.739
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON
AFTER A TRAUMA

03:28.739 --> 03:30.581
FOR A PERSON NOT TO WAKE UP
RIGHT AWAY.

03:30.581 --> 03:32.943
AND SPEAKING OF PAUL,
I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM, TOO.

03:32.943 --> 03:34.315
IF THAT'S ALL RIGHT?

03:34.315 --> 03:35.386
ETHAN, DO YOU FEEL UP TO

03:35.386 --> 03:36.447
PUSHING YOUR MOM AROUND
IN A WHEELCHAIR?

03:36.447 --> 03:38.249
OH, YEAH.
(Owen and Rachel chuckle)

03:38.249 --> 03:40.551
(whispers indistinctly)

03:40.551 --> 03:42.623
OH.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.656
MURPHY?

03:45.656 --> 03:47.658
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS.

03:47.658 --> 03:49.400
DR. BAILEY.

03:49.400 --> 03:51.462
COME IN.

03:51.462 --> 03:52.933
(siren wailing)
(Jackson) TELL ME THERE IS

03:52.933 --> 03:54.605
SOMEONE DOWN HERE
THAT I CAN HELP.

03:54.605 --> 03:55.606
IT'S FIVE AGAINST ONE
WITH THE BOARD TODAY,

03:55.606 --> 03:56.967
AND I NEED A VICTORY.

03:56.967 --> 03:59.440
BED THREE. FEMUR'S BROKEN.
I'M SENDING HIM UP TO ANGIO.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.011
OKAY.
ALERT THE PRESS.

04:01.011 --> 04:02.843
SEE WHAT I MEAN?

04:02.843 --> 04:04.275
(wheels squeaking)

04:04.275 --> 04:05.446
(tablet beeping)

04:05.446 --> 04:08.379
YOU ALL RIGHT?
MATTHEW DUMPED ME.

04:08.379 --> 04:09.520
OH.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.722
BECAUSE I LIED TO HIM
ABOUT MY VIRGINITY

04:11.722 --> 04:13.424
LIKE YOU TOLD ME TO.

04:13.424 --> 04:14.625
THAT'S NOT--

04:14.625 --> 04:16.757
I LIKED BECAUSE I HAD
SOMETHING TO LIE ABOUT.

04:16.757 --> 04:19.330
APRIL, HOLD ON A SECOND--
YOU TOOK MY...

04:19.330 --> 04:20.691
(telephone rings)

04:20.691 --> 04:22.433
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LET YOU,
BUT I DID, AND NOW HE'S GONE.

04:22.433 --> 04:24.034
I'M NOT BOARD CERTIFIED,
I'M NOT A VIRGIN,

04:24.034 --> 04:26.367
AND EVERYTHING I CARE ABOUT
HAS BEEN RUINED BECAUSE OF YOU.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.499
SO YOU KNOW WHAT?
THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THAT.
(car horn honking)

04:31.001 --> 04:32.673
SIX AGAINST ONE.
(tires screech)

04:32.673 --> 04:35.476
(man) HELP! YEAH, HELP!
WE NEED SOME HELP OVER HERE!

04:35.476 --> 04:37.308
(April) WHAT HAPPENED?
GOD, I'M GONNA PASS OUT.

04:37.308 --> 04:39.710
WE LOST SOME FINGERS.

04:39.710 --> 04:40.911
A LOT OF FINGERS.

04:40.911 --> 04:41.952
WE--WE HAD A TUG-OF-WAR.

04:41.952 --> 04:43.514
WITH WHAT,
RAZOR WIRE?

04:43.514 --> 04:45.055
EVEN BETTER.
CLOTHESLINE.

04:45.055 --> 04:46.016
DOES ANYBODY HAVE
THE SEVERED FINGERS?

04:46.016 --> 04:47.458
YEAH, I GOT 'EM.
I GOT 'EM.

04:47.458 --> 04:49.320
(ice and water slosh)

04:49.320 --> 04:50.561
(April) WHOA!
THAT'S A LOT OF FINGERS.

04:50.561 --> 04:52.663
YEAH, I COUNTED SIX.

04:52.663 --> 04:54.294
OH, NO, FIVE.
THIS ONE'S A TURKEY DOG.

04:54.294 --> 05:01.802
(April) EW.

05:01.802 --> 05:06.707
(people speak indistinctly)

05:07.478 --> 05:08.609
I WOULD, UH, LIKE YOU

05:08.609 --> 05:09.940
TO TAKE ME THROUGH
EACH OPERATION.

05:09.940 --> 05:11.612
WELL, I MEAN, IF YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR THE SOURCE,

05:11.612 --> 05:12.843
LOOK AT THE GRAFTS.

05:12.843 --> 05:14.685
I USED THE SAME ONES
ON EACH PATIENT.

05:14.685 --> 05:16.487
THIS PART
OF OUR INVESTIGATION

05:16.487 --> 05:18.549
CONCERNS YOUR INTERACTION
WITH THE INFECTED PATIENTS

05:18.549 --> 05:20.591
IN THE OPERATING ROOM,
TO THE BEST OF YOUR MEMORY.

05:20.591 --> 05:23.624
I'D NEVER USED
THIS BRAND BEFORE.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.657
I REMEMBER NOT RECOGNIZING
THE COMPANY.

05:26.657 --> 05:28.659
UH, DORTMUND OR SOMETHING--

05:28.659 --> 05:29.960
DR. BAILEY,

05:29.960 --> 05:32.363
WE'VE LOOKED AT THE GRAFTS.

05:32.363 --> 05:33.864
IT'S NOT THE GRAFTS.

05:33.864 --> 05:34.865
(huffs)

05:34.865 --> 05:35.936
(stammers)

05:35.936 --> 05:37.468
MAY I BEGIN?

05:37.468 --> 05:39.670
(clicks button)

05:39.670 --> 05:41.572
(exhales)

05:43.113 --> 05:45.115
OH, I WAS EXPECTING
A PROBING.

05:45.115 --> 05:46.977
THAT'S REALLY MORE
OF A GENTLE SWABBING.

05:46.977 --> 05:48.419
SPEAKING OF PROBING,

05:48.419 --> 05:49.920
I'VE DECIDED TO HAVE
THE BABY NATURALLY,

05:49.920 --> 05:51.652
BUT I KNOW THE SECOND
I START TO SCREAM,

05:51.652 --> 05:53.684
DEREK IS GONNA HAVE THEM
PUMP ME FULL OF DRUGS,

05:53.684 --> 05:56.857
SO I'M GOING TO NEED YOU THERE
IN MY CORNER.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.460
YEAH.
UH, I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.433
UH, WHEN BABIES COME OUT,
PEOPLE POOP ON THE TABLE.

06:02.433 --> 06:03.764
CRISTINA--
UH, NO.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.437
KAREV.
AND CAN YOU MAKE IT FAST?
(door closes)

06:06.437 --> 06:08.439
PECKWELL'S H.L.H.S. MOM
IS GONNA BE ADMITTED.

06:08.439 --> 06:10.441
WE GOTTA GO WALK HER THROUGH
THE PROCEDURE.

06:10.441 --> 06:12.473
SHE WANTS ME
TO WATCH HER GIVE BIRTH.
YOU'RE GONNA POOP ON THE TABLE.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.804
I AM NOT.

06:13.804 --> 06:15.045
YOU ARE.
ALMOST EVERYBODY DOES.

06:15.045 --> 06:16.577
OKAY, SO I POOP ON THE TABLE.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.108
IT'S PART OF THE MIRACLE
OF LIFE.

06:18.108 --> 06:19.009
IT'S NASTY.

06:19.009 --> 06:20.110
(elevator bell dings)
HUH.

06:20.110 --> 06:21.512
DID I ASK YOU
TO WATCH ME GIVE BIRTH?

06:21.512 --> 06:23.113
NO.

06:23.113 --> 06:24.485
CRISTINA?

06:24.485 --> 06:26.086
WE HAVE BEEN FRIENDS
A LONG TIME.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.758
YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW?

06:27.758 --> 06:29.620
BY NOT WATCHING
EACH OTHER POOP.

06:29.620 --> 06:32.022
HOLLA.

06:32.022 --> 06:34.124
(indistinct conversations)

06:34.124 --> 06:37.568
WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS,
THESE WOUNDS LOOK SALVAGEABLE.

06:37.568 --> 06:40.100
I WASN'T EVEN GONNA PLAY,
BUT MY BROTHER AL INSISTED.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.602
AND THEN WE WERE LOSING,
AND AL WAS ALL...

06:41.602 --> 06:42.973
(deepened voice) "WRAP
YOUR HANDS WITH THE ROPE"...

06:42.973 --> 06:45.776
AND I... DID.

06:45.776 --> 06:47.107
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

06:47.107 --> 06:50.040
UH, I JUST NEED TO IDENTIFY
WHOSE FINGERS ARE WHOSE.

06:50.040 --> 06:52.112
THAT LOOKS LIKE
A PRETTY GOOD MATCH.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.614
YEAH, EXCEPT FOR
THE RED NAIL POLISH.
YES.

06:53.614 --> 06:57.047
THAT'S MY SISTER-IN-LAW'S.
JANE, GOOD NEWS.

06:57.047 --> 06:59.419
YOUR MANICURE'S INTACT.
MM.

06:59.419 --> 07:02.092
HI, JANE.
I'M DR. AVERY.

07:02.092 --> 07:03.924
YOU MIND IF I TAKE
A LOOK HERE?

07:03.924 --> 07:06.096
HOW'S MY DAUGHTER--
FRANCES?

07:06.096 --> 07:07.528
TONY, HOW'S FRANKIE?

07:07.528 --> 07:08.699
IT'S BAD, HONEY.

07:08.699 --> 07:10.100
THE BONE'S STILL STICKING OUT.

07:10.100 --> 07:11.161
(man) THIS IS ALL
GIGANTOR'S FAULT.

07:11.161 --> 07:12.703
WHAT'S HE DOING
AT OUR REUNION ANYWAY?

07:12.703 --> 07:14.735
HE'S NOT EVEN RELATED.
HE'S UNCLE TONY'S WEIRD FRIEND.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.106
(crying) I DIDN'T MEAN
TO PULL SO HARD.

07:16.106 --> 07:17.968
LAY OFF GUNNAR, CASH.
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

07:17.968 --> 07:20.541
HE DIDN'T SUGGEST TO PLAY
TUG-OF-WAR WITH A CLOTHESLINE.

07:20.541 --> 07:23.073
YOU WANT TO BLAME SOMEBODY,
BLAME YOUR UNCLE AL.

07:23.073 --> 07:25.045
OKAY, KELLERS, I'M BACK

07:25.045 --> 07:27.017
AND I'M ARMED
WITH FRENCH FRIES.

07:27.017 --> 07:28.979
HUH? ANY TAKERS?
(groaning)

07:28.979 --> 07:31.081
WE CAN'T EAT, AL.

07:31.081 --> 07:33.083
WE'RE JUST ABOUT TO GET
OUR FINGERS REATTACHED.
OKAY, UH... ANYBODY COLD?

07:33.083 --> 07:34.825
I-I CAN FIND BLANKETS.

07:34.825 --> 07:36.987
STOP, AL! JUST STOP!

07:36.987 --> 07:39.730
NOBODY'S HUNGRY OR THIRSTY
OR WANTS TO RUN A RELAY RACE!

07:39.730 --> 07:41.732
REUNION'S OVER.

07:41.732 --> 07:43.163
OKAY, FRANKIE. I'M GONNA
NEED TO GET SOME X-RAYS.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.695
YOU GONNA BE OKAY BEING AWAY
FROM YOUR FAMILY

07:44.695 --> 07:45.866
FOR A LITTLE WHILE?
(tablet beeping)

07:45.866 --> 07:47.037
(elevator bell dings)

07:47.037 --> 07:47.998
YES, PLEASE.

07:47.998 --> 07:50.470
YEAH. OKAY. (laughs)

07:50.470 --> 07:53.874
DR. HUNT SAYS IT'S GOOD
TO TALK TO HIM, TOO.

07:53.874 --> 07:57.548
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

07:57.548 --> 07:59.079
HEY, BABE.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.652
I GOTTA BE HONEST WITH YA.
YOU'VE LOOKED BETTER.

08:01.652 --> 08:04.114
(chuckles) ME? WELL...

08:04.114 --> 08:06.657
I HAVEN'T LOOKED THIS GOOD
SINCE THAT SUMMER

08:06.657 --> 08:10.090
THAT WE WENT TO THE RIVER
AND I GOT THAT STOMACH BUG

08:10.090 --> 08:12.993
AND I LOST, LIKE, 15 POUNDS.
(chuckles)

08:12.993 --> 08:14.224
YOU'RE MISSING IT.

08:14.224 --> 08:15.966
(crying) STOP IT.

08:15.966 --> 08:18.128
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

08:18.128 --> 08:21.702
NONE OF THIS IS FUNNY.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.875
MY SON IS DYING.
HE'S--HE'S NOT DYING.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.977
WE ARE A LONG WAY OFF
FROM THAT.

08:26.977 --> 08:31.041
I KNOW THAT THIS MAY LOOK BAD,
BUT YOU--
IT SHOULD BE ME.

08:31.041 --> 08:32.082
HEY, ETHIE.
IT SHOULD BE ME.

08:32.082 --> 08:33.884
UM, WHY DON'T WE GIVE GRANDMA

08:33.884 --> 08:35.716
A LITTLE ONE-ON-ONE TIME
WITH POP?

08:35.716 --> 08:37.117
YOU WANT TO TAKE ME
FOR A SPIN?

08:37.117 --> 08:38.649
(continues crying)

08:38.649 --> 08:40.651
I THINK THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

08:40.651 --> 08:41.922
GO ON.
GIVE HER THE NICKEL TOUR.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.094
ALL RIGHT?
(continues crying)

08:44.094 --> 08:45.996
CAN I HOLD HIM
AFTER HE'S BORN?
(heartbeat playing over monitor)

08:45.996 --> 08:48.198
JUST FOR A MINUTE.

08:48.198 --> 08:51.061
UH, HE'S GONNA NEED
TO GO RIGHT INTO SURGERY.

08:51.061 --> 08:53.063
YOUR BABY HAS HYPOPLASTIC
LEFT HEART SYNDROME

08:53.063 --> 08:55.005
AND AN INTACT ATRIAL SEPTUM

08:55.005 --> 08:57.568
THAT IS CAUSING
A RESTRICTION TO BLOOD FLOW.

08:57.568 --> 08:59.239
HE'S FINE WHEN HE'S IN UTERO,
BUT ONCE HE'S OUT...

08:59.239 --> 09:00.911
(ultrasound beeps)
THE CONDITION IS FATAL.

09:00.911 --> 09:03.143
(Jason) WHICH MEANS HE WON'T BE
GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN.

09:03.143 --> 09:04.975
WE'LL LET YOU HOLD HIM
WHEN HE'S STABLE,

09:04.975 --> 09:06.847
AFTER HIS SURGERY.
(Alex) OKAY.

09:06.847 --> 09:08.218
SO WE'LL DO THE C-SECTION,

09:08.218 --> 09:10.651
AND THEN WE'LL HAVE 60 MINUTES
TO GET HIM TO THE CATH LAB

09:10.651 --> 09:12.823
AND PERFORM THE OPERATION
TO OPEN HIS SEPTUM.

09:12.823 --> 09:14.825
AND IF YOU DON'T MAKE IT
IN TIME, HE COULD DIE?

09:14.825 --> 09:17.157
(Cristina) NO, WE CAN DO
THE C-SECTION IN THE CATH LAB.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.589
IT'LL GIVE US MORE TIME.

09:18.589 --> 09:20.090
DELIVER IN ONE ROOM
AND OPERATE IN THE OTHER.

09:20.090 --> 09:22.232
CAN YOU DO THAT?
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

09:22.232 --> 09:24.835
(door squeaks)
THERE ARE ABOUT
A THOUSAND REASONS WHY NOT.

09:24.835 --> 09:27.037
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE HAVE BABIES
ALL OVER THE PLACE--

09:27.037 --> 09:29.970
TAXI CABS,
HIGH SCHOOL BATHROOMS.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.301
IF WE DON'T HAVE TO
WASTE TIME

09:31.301 --> 09:32.873
MOVING THE KID
FROM ONE FLOOR TO ANOTHER,

09:32.873 --> 09:34.104
WHY SHOULD WE?

09:34.104 --> 09:35.946
BECAUSE YOU DON'T DO C-SECTIONS
IN CATH LABS.

09:35.946 --> 09:37.077
OH, KAREV, BACK ME UP.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.609
I'M WITH PECKWELL.
(telephone rings)

09:38.609 --> 09:39.710
NOT MY NAME, BUT OKAY.

09:39.710 --> 09:41.281
THIS WHOLE SITUATION
IS HIGH RISK.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.713
IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG,

09:42.713 --> 09:43.784
WE DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS
ON HAND TO DEAL WITH IT.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.585
ARE YOUR TOOLS GLUED
TO THE FLOOR?

09:45.585 --> 09:46.917
BRING THEM WITH YOU.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.218
OKAY, WE HAVE
AN OPPORTUNITY HERE

09:48.218 --> 09:49.920
TO DO SOMETHING NEW

09:49.920 --> 09:51.822
AND BADASS.

09:51.822 --> 09:54.024
I MEAN, DON'T YOU WANT TO BE
THE BADASS

09:54.024 --> 09:55.325
WHO DELIVERS THE KID
IN A CATH LAB?

09:55.325 --> 09:56.797
WHO DOES THAT?

09:56.797 --> 09:59.169
NOBODY... BUT YOU.

09:59.169 --> 10:00.901
OKAY.

10:00.901 --> 10:02.703
(elevator bell dings)
OKAY, I'M IN.

10:02.703 --> 10:05.035
ALL RIGHT.
KAREV, YOU WITH PECKWELL?

10:05.035 --> 10:06.236
MYERS.
DR. JASON MYERS.

10:06.236 --> 10:09.039
NOBODY CARES. KAREV?
ALL RIGHT.

10:09.039 --> 10:11.281
SOUNDS LIKE
ONE NASTY TUG-OF-WAR.

10:11.281 --> 10:13.143
IT WAS THE HEIGHT OF IDIOCY,

10:13.143 --> 10:14.945
WHICH IS SAYING A LOT
FOR MY FAMILY.

10:14.945 --> 10:16.286
I'M A JOURNALIST.

10:16.286 --> 10:18.188
I COVER THE SOPHOMORE BEAT
FOR MY SCHOOL PAPER.
MM.

10:18.188 --> 10:19.349
AND THEY CHOSE ME TO EDIT

10:19.349 --> 10:21.051
THE SPRING SUPPLEMENT
THIS WEEKEND,

10:21.051 --> 10:22.352
BUT MY PARENTS TOLD ME

10:22.352 --> 10:24.154
I HAD TO GO
TO THIS STUPID REUNION,

10:24.154 --> 10:25.395
THAT IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT
TO PRETEND

10:25.395 --> 10:27.127
NOT TO HATE PEOPLE
I HATE.

10:27.127 --> 10:30.330
AND NOW MY HAND IS RUINED
AND MY CAREER IS OVER.

10:30.330 --> 10:31.702
WHOA. WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

10:31.702 --> 10:32.963
YOUR HAND
IS GOING TO BE JUST FINE.

10:32.963 --> 10:34.134
I WILL SEE TO THAT.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.405
OKAY? AND... (chuckles)

10:35.405 --> 10:38.138
YOU HAVE LOTS OF TIME
TO WORRY ABOUT YOUR CAREER.

10:38.138 --> 10:40.771
OKAY?
OKAY.

10:40.771 --> 10:43.143
ALL RIGHT. SO DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS BEFORE WE START?

10:43.143 --> 10:44.414
MM. JUST ONE.
SOMEONE TOOK MY CELL PHONE.

10:44.414 --> 10:45.976
CAN I GET THAT BACK?

10:45.976 --> 10:47.347
SURE.
RIGHT AFTER THE SCAN.

10:47.347 --> 10:50.080
AND I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP.
WHAT'S THE C.D.C. DOING HERE?

10:50.080 --> 10:52.382
(telephone rings)
(woman) CAN I HELP YOU?

10:52.382 --> 10:54.685
(man speaks indistinctly)

10:54.685 --> 10:57.187
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA
LIE DOWN NOW.

10:57.187 --> 10:58.859
GOOD.

10:58.859 --> 11:00.991
ALL RIGHT. TRY TO STAY STILL.
TRY TO STAY STILL.

11:00.991 --> 11:02.162
THANK YOU.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.694
OKAY, BEGINNING WITH JOYCE.

11:03.694 --> 11:06.997
JOYCE BASCHE--I PLACED
AN A.V. GRAFT FOR HEMODIALYSIS.

11:06.997 --> 11:07.998
TAKE ME THROUGH THAT.

11:07.998 --> 11:10.070
I MADE AN INCISION

11:10.070 --> 11:12.843
OVER THE RADIAL ARTERY
AND BASILIC VEIN--

11:12.843 --> 11:14.144
I'M SORRY.

11:14.144 --> 11:16.446
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO
GO BACK A LITTLE FURTHER.

11:16.446 --> 11:17.708
DID YOU SCRUB?

11:17.708 --> 11:19.179
DID I SCRUB?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.080
FOR HOW LONG DID YOU SCRUB,
ROUGHLY?

11:23.383 --> 11:26.987
4 MINUTES, 36 SECONDS,
EXACTLY.

11:26.987 --> 11:28.819
YOU'RE SURE ABOUT THAT?
I AM.

11:28.819 --> 11:31.091
I USED "THINK,"
THE ARETHA FRANKLIN SONG.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.124
I RUN IT IN MY HEAD.
IT'S 2 MINUTES, 18 SECONDS.

11:34.124 --> 11:36.296
HOSPITAL PROTOCOL
IS A 4-MINUTE SCRUB,

11:36.296 --> 11:38.198
SO I GO THROUGH IT TWICE.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.230
(Aretha Franklin) ♪ THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO TO ME ♪

11:40.230 --> 11:42.072

THAT WAS?

12:08.298 --> 12:11.461
I DID A STANDARD
VASCULAR ANASTOMOSIS

12:11.461 --> 12:12.933
WITH RUNNING PROLENE.

12:12.933 --> 12:14.064
I CHECKED FOR LEAKS.
THERE WERE NONE.

12:14.064 --> 12:17.407
AND YOU CLOSED
OR DR. MURPHY?

12:17.407 --> 12:21.071
WAIT. THE DOPPLER.

12:21.071 --> 12:22.242
(doppler whooshing)

12:22.242 --> 12:25.045
I... CONFIRMED GOOD FLOW

ALL RIGHT.
ANYTHING ELSE YOU REMEMBER?

12:36.756 --> 12:38.388
I REMEMBER SAYING,
"THAT WENT PERFECTLY."

12:38.388 --> 12:41.461
ALL RIGHT.
LET'S MOVE ON TO SETH LEPIK.

12:41.461 --> 12:42.833
(inhales deeply)

12:42.833 --> 12:44.034
(hand slaps table,
sorts papers)

12:44.034 --> 12:46.496
(monitor beeping steadily)

12:46.496 --> 12:48.999
(crying)
(whispers) I GOT THIS.

12:48.999 --> 12:50.841
(normal voice)
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

12:50.841 --> 12:52.142
THESE GUYS
WON'T TELL US ANYTHING.

12:52.142 --> 12:53.303
SIR--

12:53.303 --> 12:55.005
I WANT MY SON OUTTA HERE.

12:55.005 --> 12:57.777
I WANT HIM TRANSFERRED
TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL RIGHT NOW.

12:57.777 --> 12:58.879
I UNDERSTAND.
I'LL HAVE TO TELL YOU,

12:58.879 --> 13:00.010
MOVING SETH NOW WOULD PUT HIM

13:00.010 --> 13:01.781
AT GREATER RISK
FOR MORE COMPLICATIONS.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.283
IF WE'RE HOPING TO AVOID
ANOTHER SURGERY--

13:03.283 --> 13:04.815
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT, WE ARE.

13:04.815 --> 13:06.917
YOU'RE NOT TOUCHING
MY SON AGAIN.

13:09.089 --> 13:11.121
(sighs)

13:11.121 --> 13:13.824
SEE WHAT YOU CAN DO
TO ARRANGE A TRANSFER.

13:23.033 --> 13:24.334
HEY, MYERS SET UP FOR
THE C-SECTION IN THE CATH LAB.

13:24.334 --> 13:26.036
WE NEED TO RUN THROUGH
THE STEPS OF THE PROCEDURE.

13:26.036 --> 13:27.577
LOOK AT YOU. "MYERS."

13:27.577 --> 13:29.940
YOU SAY IT LIKE HE ISN'T
NAILING YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

13:29.940 --> 13:31.211
SHE'S NOT MY GIRLFRIEND.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.883
WHATEVER. YOU LOVE HER.

13:32.883 --> 13:34.144
SHE'S MY FRIEND.
(telephone rings)

13:34.144 --> 13:36.186
YOU SOUND STUPID
WHEN YOU SAY THAT.

13:36.186 --> 13:37.888
SHE'S MOVING IN
WITH THE GUY.

13:37.888 --> 13:39.189
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

13:39.189 --> 13:40.891
BEAT HIM UP.

13:40.891 --> 13:43.153
NO. I'M GONNA TRY TO BE NICE
TO HIM AND GET ALONG

13:43.153 --> 13:44.955
SO I DON'T LOSE MY FRIEND.

13:44.955 --> 13:47.827
OR YOU COULD PUNCH HIM
AND TAKE BACK YOUR GIRL.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.460
(elevator bell dings)

13:50.460 --> 13:51.831
HI, FRANKIE.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.003
HEY, HAVE YOU FOUND
MY PHONE YET?

13:53.003 --> 13:55.235
UH, NOT YET.
SO THIS IS DR. ROBBINS.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.207
HI.
SHE'S GONNA ASSIST ME
IN SURGERY.

13:57.207 --> 14:00.040
NOW YOUR HAND
WAS PRETTY BADLY CRUSHED...
(typing)

14:00.040 --> 14:01.841
(beeping)
FROM THE TRAMPLING,

14:01.841 --> 14:04.044
SO IT'S GONNA MEAN
AN EXTENSIVE SURGERY

14:04.044 --> 14:05.375
TO REPAIR THESE BONES
HERE AND HERE

14:05.375 --> 14:06.546
AND FIXATE THESE.

14:06.546 --> 14:07.918
OH, MY GOD.

14:07.918 --> 14:09.249
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

14:09.249 --> 14:11.151
I MEAN, SHE'S GONNA BE ABLE TO,
YOU KNOW, USE HER HAND?

14:11.151 --> 14:13.853
OH, THAT'S THE GOAL.

14:13.853 --> 14:16.286
SWEETIE, I'M GONNA GO TELL
YOUR MOM YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.
OKAY.

14:16.286 --> 14:18.458
(indistinct conversations)

14:18.458 --> 14:20.530
OKAY.
IT'S WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT,
HONEY.

14:20.530 --> 14:22.933
(elevator bell dings)

14:22.933 --> 14:24.494
(indistinct conversations
continue)

14:24.494 --> 14:26.166
ALL RIGHT, SO DO YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS

14:26.166 --> 14:27.467
BEFORE WE TAKE YOU UP?

14:27.467 --> 14:29.139
NO.
OKAY.

14:29.139 --> 14:30.500
(types)
ACTUALLY, I DO HAVE ONE.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.871
MM.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.974
UM, THE C.D.C.
IS INVESTIGATING DR. BAILEY

14:33.974 --> 14:35.906
BECAUSE SEVERAL
OF HER PATIENTS DIED, RIGHT?

14:35.906 --> 14:38.148
UH, UM, WHO TOLD YOU
ABOUT DR. BAILEY?

14:38.148 --> 14:40.010
I ASKED AN ORDERLY.
OH, SHOOT.

14:40.010 --> 14:43.483
I MEAN, I CAN'T REVEAL
MY SOURCES. (laughs)

14:43.483 --> 14:45.215
BUT YOU JUST CONFIRMED IT
FOR ME,

14:45.215 --> 14:46.586
SO YOU CAN BE
MY SECOND SOURCE.
OH, NO, I DIDN'T.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.959
THAT'S DR. ROBBINS?
HEY!

14:48.959 --> 14:50.120
(telephone rings)

14:54.224 --> 14:58.398
(indistinct conversations)

14:58.398 --> 14:59.930
(beeps)

14:59.930 --> 15:01.531
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

15:01.531 --> 15:03.203
(beeps)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

15:03.203 --> 15:04.534
CHECKING BAILEY'S POST-OPS.

15:04.534 --> 15:06.336
I THOUGHT RICHARD WAS TAKING
CARE OF BAILEY'S PATIENTS.

15:06.336 --> 15:08.578
JUST SETH LEPIK, THE INFECTED
GUY. I TOOK THE REST.

15:08.578 --> 15:10.510
BAILEY'S PATIENTS ARE
ALL TURNING UP WITH STAPH.

15:10.510 --> 15:12.042
YOU'RE PREGNANT.
WHY TAKE THE RISK?

15:12.042 --> 15:13.213
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING OUT
FOR BAILEY.

15:13.213 --> 15:15.515
AND I'M TRYING
TO LOOK OUT FOR YOU.

15:15.515 --> 15:17.217
(telephone rings in distance)

15:17.217 --> 15:19.589
THIS IS WHY I NEED CRISTINA
IN THE ROOM.

15:19.589 --> 15:20.991
WHAT ROOM?

15:20.991 --> 15:22.422
THE DELIVERY ROOM.
(elevator bell dings)

15:22.422 --> 15:24.294
WAIT. WHAT?

15:26.026 --> 15:27.497
HEY. HEY, HEY, HEY.

15:27.497 --> 15:29.059
(Cristina speaks indistinctly)

15:29.059 --> 15:30.360
ON-CALL ROOM, YOU AND ME?

15:30.360 --> 15:32.232
(chuckles) OH, I WISH.

15:32.232 --> 15:34.564
UH, BUT I HAVE
AN ATRIAL SEPTOSTOMY WITH KAREV.

15:34.564 --> 15:38.038
OH.
BUT AFTER I SAVE A BABY'S LIFE,
I'M GONNA NEED TO CELEBRATE.

15:38.038 --> 15:39.209
OKAY. WELL, FIND ME.

15:39.209 --> 15:41.271
OH. HOW, UH, IS THE GRANDMA?

15:41.271 --> 15:43.413
UH, SHE'S SWEET, BUT USELESS.

15:43.413 --> 15:46.146
RACHEL'S DOING BETTER, THOUGH,
SO AT LEAST ETHAN'S GOT HER.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.248
MM. PAUL'S GONNA WAKE UP.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.420
I'VE BEEN DOING
SERIAL NEURO EXAMS.

15:50.420 --> 15:51.681
I HAVE A GOOD FEELING.

15:51.681 --> 15:53.553
SPOKEN LIKE
A TRUE SCIENTIST.

15:53.553 --> 15:55.125
MM-HMM.

15:55.125 --> 15:56.526
MMM. THANK YOU.

15:56.526 --> 15:58.228
THANK YOU FOR HAVING
A GOOD FEELING.

15:58.228 --> 15:59.189
ANYTIME.

15:59.189 --> 16:00.330
(chuckles)

16:00.330 --> 16:03.033
OH, MER ASKED ME
TO BE AT HER BIRTH

16:03.033 --> 16:05.065
AND WATCH HER
POOP ON A TABLE.

16:05.065 --> 16:06.166
YOU HAVE TO DO THAT.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.497
CAN'T I JUST SHOW UP AFTER

16:07.497 --> 16:09.339
WHEN EVERYONE HAS CONTROL
OF THEIR BOWELS?

16:09.339 --> 16:12.442
WATCHING A BABY BE BORN
IS LIKE SEEING GOD IN PERSON.

16:12.442 --> 16:14.444
(bell dings)

16:14.444 --> 16:17.147
SPOKEN LIKE A TRUE SCIENTIST.

16:17.147 --> 16:22.452
I USED SCISSORS TO
SHORTEN THE GRAFT TO FIT.

16:22.452 --> 16:25.285
TOOK ABOUT
A CENTIMETER OFF.

16:25.285 --> 16:28.358
I REMEMBER MR. LEPIK
HAD DEEP VESSELS.

16:28.358 --> 16:32.192
UM, SO I ASKED FRAN
FOR MORE RETRACTION.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.163
I'M SORRY. FRAN?

16:33.163 --> 16:34.524
YOU NAMED LINDA

16:34.524 --> 16:36.366
AS YOUR SCRUB NURSE
ON MR. LEPIK'S SURGERY.

16:36.366 --> 16:38.098
YES. YES, RIGHT. SORRY.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.070
UM...

16:40.070 --> 16:42.702
THEN I FINISHED THE GRAFT,
AND I CLOSED.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.175
(clears throat)
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE LEAK?

16:45.175 --> 16:47.037
ACCORDING TO
MR. LEPIK'S CHART,

16:47.037 --> 16:49.339
THERE WAS A SMALL LEAK
ON THE VENOUS SIDE.

16:49.339 --> 16:50.380
YES. LEPIK.

16:50.380 --> 16:52.542
YES. UH, HE HAD A LEAK.

16:52.542 --> 16:55.245
UM, AND I PUT IN
AN INTERRUPTED STITCH.

16:55.245 --> 16:56.546
YOU REMEMBER THAT?

16:56.546 --> 16:58.218
YES, I REMEMBER.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.750
I IRRIGATED
WITH ANTIBIOTIC SOLUTION

17:00.750 --> 17:04.254
TO AVOID INFECTION,
THEN I CLOSED.

17:04.254 --> 17:06.096
YOU CLOSED?
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

17:06.096 --> 17:07.327
I DID. I CLOSED.

17:07.327 --> 17:08.558
YOU'RE SURE? BECAUSE YOUR--

17:08.558 --> 17:10.200
DID YOU PUT THE CAP
ON THE TOOTHPASTE?

17:10.200 --> 17:11.501
SORRY?

17:11.501 --> 17:14.033
I ASSUMED YOU BRUSHED
YOUR TEETH THIS MORNING.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.536
SO DID YOU PUT THE CAP BACK ON
THE TOOTHPASTE OR DIDN'T YOU?

17:16.536 --> 17:18.168
OR CAN YOU BE SURE?

17:18.168 --> 17:19.709
BECAUSE WHEN YOU DO A THING
EVERY SINGLE DAY--

17:19.709 --> 17:21.711
DR. BAILEY,
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

17:21.711 --> 17:23.243
THE LIVES OF TWO PEOPLE.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.216
WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK
I KNOW THAT? D-DON'T INSULT ME.

17:26.216 --> 17:28.748
(voice breaking)
THESE ARE MY PATIENTS WHO DIED.

17:28.748 --> 17:31.781
YOU THINK I DON'T KNOW THAT
FAR, FAR BETTER THAN YOU?

17:33.623 --> 17:36.456
SO AGAIN, UH,
ARE YOU SURE YOU CLOSED?

17:38.828 --> 17:40.160
CAN I TAKE A BREAK,
PLEASE?

17:40.160 --> 17:43.163
THERE'S ONLY A LITTLE MORE
TO, UH...

17:44.494 --> 17:46.836
(door squeaks)

17:46.836 --> 17:48.298
DO.

17:54.444 --> 17:56.306
HEY. IS YOUR INTERVIEW OVER?

17:56.306 --> 17:58.648
WE'RE... ON A BREAK.
WAIT. WAIT.

17:58.648 --> 18:01.080
AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO BE
AVOIDING ME LIKE THE PLAGUE?

18:01.080 --> 18:02.312
COME ON.
WHAT CAN I DO TO HELP?

18:02.312 --> 18:03.483
ANYTHING?

18:03.483 --> 18:04.654
(exhales)

18:04.654 --> 18:07.457
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
HOW SETH LEPIK IS.

18:07.457 --> 18:08.818
I'D LIKE TO SEE HIS CHART,

18:08.818 --> 18:11.321
BUT THEY LOCKED ME
OUT OF THE SYSTEM.

18:11.321 --> 18:13.363
OKAY.

18:13.363 --> 18:14.694
(Jackson) DR. GREY.
(tablet beeps)

18:14.694 --> 18:16.196
(slaps table)

18:22.702 --> 18:24.674
SHE WANTS TO CHECK
ON HER PATIENTS.

18:24.674 --> 18:26.436
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE'S
GONNA DO, ALTER THEIR CHARTS?

18:26.436 --> 18:28.308
THAT'S WHAT THE C.D.C.
IS GONNA THINK, YES.

18:28.308 --> 18:29.809
WELL, MAYBE YOU CALLED THEM
TOO SOON.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.411
I AM THINKING OF
THE BIGGER PICTURE HERE.

18:31.411 --> 18:33.112
SHE'S PART OF THAT PICTURE.

18:33.112 --> 18:35.385
WE NEED TO STAND BY
OUR DOCTORS.

18:35.385 --> 18:38.117
EVEN IF SHE'S AT FAULT?
WE STAND BY HER THEN?
SHE'S NOT.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.420
BUT WE SHOULD CROSS THAT BRIDGE
WHEN WE GET TO IT.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.551
WE'RE KIND OF AT THAT BRIDGE.

18:41.551 --> 18:45.155
UH, EXCUSE ME, UH,
DR. AVERY?
YES.

18:45.155 --> 18:47.297
SORRY TO BUG YOU, BUT I WAS JUST
KIND OF WONDERING, IS THERE, UH,

18:47.297 --> 18:50.430
ANY UPDATE ON MY FAMILY...

18:50.430 --> 18:51.631
OR THEIR FINGERS?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.463
(silverware clatters)
(Ethan) MOM? MOM!

18:53.463 --> 18:55.305

MOM?

18:55.305 --> 18:56.566
(man) WHAT'S WRONG?
WHAT'S GOING ON?
(woman) SHE NEEDS SOME HELP.

18:56.566 --> 18:57.737
UH, MA'AM?

18:57.737 --> 18:59.339
HEY, WHAT'S YOUR MOM'S NAME?
RACHEL.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.171
DR. BAILEY, STEP AWAY
FROM THE PATIENT, NOW.

19:01.171 --> 19:03.142
OKAY, LET'S CLEAR THE WHEELCHAIR
AND THE TABLES.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.474
(woman) I GOT IT.
MAKE ROOM.

19:04.474 --> 19:07.177
OKAY, LAY HER DOWN.
ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

19:07.177 --> 19:08.448

19:22.161 --> 19:24.494
(Amelia) NO! STOP.

19:24.494 --> 19:25.935
I CAN'T DO THIS.

19:25.935 --> 19:27.397
NOT RIGHT NOW.

19:27.397 --> 19:29.439
HIS HEART IS OKAY NOW.

19:29.439 --> 19:30.870
AND YOU ALL KNOW THAT
WHEN HE COMES OUT,

19:30.870 --> 19:32.442
IT'S GOING TO STOP WORKING.

19:32.442 --> 19:36.546
(crying) I'M NOT READY
FOR HIM TO DIE.
AMELIE, HONEY--

19:36.546 --> 19:38.848
(continues crying) NO.
LOOK AT ME. LOOK IN MY EYES.

19:38.848 --> 19:40.910

19:40.910 --> 19:42.852

19:56.426 --> 19:58.868

WHAT I HAVE SO FAR.

20:12.682 --> 20:14.384
THERE'S SOME KIND

YOU DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.519
YOU CAN JUST NOD

20:19.519 --> 20:21.321

20:22.492 --> 20:23.523

23:11.721 --> 23:13.993
BUT DR. SHEPHERD SAID SHE WAS
GETTING BETTER THIS MORNING.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.725
YES, BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING

23:15.725 --> 23:19.569
GOING ON IN HER BRAIN
THAT WAS...

23:19.569 --> 23:21.471
SUDDEN

23:21.471 --> 23:23.603
AND COULDN'T BE PREVENTED.

23:23.603 --> 23:26.876
THERE WAS NO WAY OF KNOWING
THAT THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN.

23:26.876 --> 23:29.479
MM. COULD IT HAVE BEEN
THE ICE CREAM?

23:29.479 --> 23:30.980
LIKE A BRAIN FREEZE?

23:30.980 --> 23:33.042
NO. NO.

23:33.042 --> 23:35.084
ETHAN...

23:36.546 --> 23:38.588
THERE WAS NOTHING
ANYONE COULD HAVE DONE

23:38.588 --> 23:40.149
TO HAVE STOPPED THIS.

23:40.149 --> 23:44.524
(sobbing)

23:44.524 --> 23:46.996
WELL... I NEED TO GO NOW
TO MY GRANDMA.

23:46.996 --> 23:50.530
SHE NEEDS SOMEONE
TO HOLD HER HAND.

23:50.530 --> 23:52.832
(sighs and sniffles)

23:52.832 --> 23:55.004
(whispers) I'M SO SORRY.
(crying)

23:55.004 --> 23:58.538
(crying continues)

23:58.538 --> 23:59.709
(exhales deeply)

23:59.709 --> 24:02.211
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

24:02.211 --> 24:05.575
ALL RIGHT, DEEDEE AND JANE'S
SURGERIES BOTH WENT VERY WELL.

24:05.575 --> 24:06.546
(woman) OHH.
THEY'LL BE IN RECOVERY SOON.

24:06.546 --> 24:08.147
CASH IS STILL IN SURGERY,

24:08.147 --> 24:10.480
AND DR. TORRES
IS IN WITH FRANKIE NOW.

24:10.480 --> 24:12.582
HER FRACTURES
WERE COMPLICATED,

24:12.582 --> 24:13.753
BUT HOPEFULLY, WITH THERAPY,

24:13.753 --> 24:15.525
SHE'LL REGAIN FULL USE
OF HER HAND.

24:15.525 --> 24:17.156
THERAPY?

24:17.156 --> 24:18.528
HOW MUCH THERAPY?

24:18.528 --> 24:19.859
WELL,
THAT'S HARD TO SAY NOW, TONY.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.832
BUT IT COULD BE ANYWHERE
FROM SIX MONTHS TO A YEAR.

24:22.832 --> 24:25.034
(telephone rings)

24:25.034 --> 24:26.566
YOU HEAR THAT?

24:26.566 --> 24:28.668
A YEAR OF PHYSICAL THERAPY,
AL.

24:28.668 --> 24:31.941
AND THEN SHE MIGHT GET
FULL USE BACK. MIGHT.

24:31.941 --> 24:33.472
WELL, UH...

24:33.472 --> 24:35.675
LET'S LOOK
AT THE BRIGHT SIDE NOW--

24:35.675 --> 24:38.247
THE BRIGHT SIDE?
EVERYONE IS MANGLED.

24:38.247 --> 24:39.949
WELL, NOT FRANKIE.

24:39.949 --> 24:41.751
SHE GOT LUCKY.

24:41.751 --> 24:44.514
SHE'S STILL GOT
ALL HER DIGITS, TONE.

24:44.514 --> 24:46.185
HER HAND WAS CRUSHED!

24:46.185 --> 24:49.058
I KNOW. I-I-IT'S HORRIBLE.
I-I KNOW IT. AND...

24:49.058 --> 24:51.060
AND I'M SORRY,
BUT, HEY, WELL,

24:51.060 --> 24:54.524
WELL... WE'RE ALL HERE
FOR YOU.

24:54.524 --> 24:56.526
AND, UH... THAT'S WHY
WE'RE A FAMILY, RIGHT...

24:56.526 --> 24:58.027

24:58.027 --> 25:00.029
HEY. COME ON, HUH?

25:00.029 --> 25:02.071

25:02.071 --> 25:03.673
OW!

25:03.673 --> 25:04.904

(indistinct shouting)

25:04.904 --> 25:06.536
LET ME GET A LOOK HERE.
(Gunnar) YOU ALL RIGHT?

25:06.536 --> 25:08.207
I THINK I BROKE MY HAND.

25:08.207 --> 25:10.039
(Richard)
HE'S NOT STABILIZING.

25:10.039 --> 25:11.681
HE NEEDS SURGERY IMMEDIATELY.

25:11.681 --> 25:14.013
NO, NOT IN THIS CESSPOOL.

25:14.013 --> 25:15.284
AN AMBULANCE IS COMING
FOR HIM.

25:15.284 --> 25:16.616
NO, HE'S TOO UNSTABLE
TO TRANSFER.

25:16.616 --> 25:18.017
I'M CANCELING ALL--

25:18.017 --> 25:20.189
YOU GUYS HAVE SOME INFECTION
RUNNING RAMPANT.

25:20.189 --> 25:21.921
IT'S NOT SAFE.

25:21.921 --> 25:24.523
IT'S NOT THE HOSPITAL.
IT'S ONE DOCTOR.

25:24.523 --> 25:27.927
THE INFECTION CAME FROM
ONE DOCTOR AND ONE DOCTOR ALONE.

25:27.927 --> 25:29.058
SHE'S BEEN ISOLATED,

25:29.058 --> 25:30.630
AND THE INFECTION
HAS BEEN CONTAINED.

25:30.630 --> 25:32.031
I'VE BEEN TESTED. I'M CLEAN.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.803
THE O.R. HAS BEEN TESTED.
IT'S CLEAN.

25:33.803 --> 25:36.535
IF WE DON'T GO RIGHT NOW,
YOUR SON'S GONNA DIE.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.868

25:50.820 --> 25:52.682
YOU CLEARED TO SCRUB IN?

25:52.682 --> 25:53.983
YES, SIR. THEY CLEARED ME
THIS MORNING.

25:53.983 --> 25:55.324
OKAY, PREP HIM.

25:55.324 --> 25:57.587
SO BAILEY
DID DO SOMETHING WRONG.

25:57.587 --> 25:58.888
OF COURSE NOT.

25:58.888 --> 26:00.990
I ONLY SAID THAT
TO GET THEIR KID INTO SURGERY,

26:00.990 --> 26:02.832
AND IF YOU REPEAT IT,
I'LL HAVE YOUR ASS FIRED

26:02.832 --> 26:05.795
BEFORE YOU FINISH TALKING,
YOU UNDERSTAND?

26:13.743 --> 26:15.675

THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED.

26:15.675 --> 26:17.176

A PIECE OF WORK.

26:17.176 --> 26:18.277
YEAH. WELL,
TRY LIVING WITH HER.

26:18.277 --> 26:19.649

26:19.649 --> 26:22.181
LISTEN, MAN, I APPRECIATE
YOUR WORK TODAY.

26:22.181 --> 26:25.314
I THINK THIS THING WITH JO
GOT US OFF ON A BAD FOOT.

26:25.314 --> 26:26.786
SHE CARES A LOT ABOUT YOU.

26:26.786 --> 26:28.287
WE'RE FRIENDS. THAT'S ALL.

26:28.287 --> 26:30.319
ALL RIGHT.

26:30.319 --> 26:31.621
ALL RIGHT.

26:31.621 --> 26:34.263
I HAD
A MESSED-UP CHILDHOOD, TOO.

26:34.263 --> 26:37.196
I WAS A FOSTER KID LIKE HER.
IT WAS CRAPPY.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.298
BUT I DIDN'T HAVE IT
NEAR AS BAD AS JO DID.

26:39.298 --> 26:42.301
I WAS NEVER HOMELESS,
NEVER HAD TO LIVE IN MY CAR.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.734
BUT SHE'S, UH, REALLY
TURNED IT AROUND FOR HERSELF.

26:44.734 --> 26:46.636
AND I JUST, UH...

26:46.636 --> 26:48.607
I WANT THE BEST FOR HER,
IS ALL.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.710
YEAH, OKAY.

26:52.141 --> 26:54.644
YEAH.
THANKS FOR TODAY.

26:55.915 --> 26:58.087

27:05.795 --> 27:07.156

A FEW TIMES,

I'D LIKE TO HEAR IT.

31:59.588 --> 32:01.350
(sighs)

32:01.350 --> 32:03.252
THAT'S YOUR CALL.

32:03.252 --> 32:04.593
WE HAVE A PROTOCOL
FOR A REASON.

32:04.593 --> 32:06.125
OKAY, WE VOTE.

32:09.928 --> 32:12.001
SHE STAYS.

32:14.563 --> 32:16.005
(door closes)

32:16.005 --> 32:17.536
STAPH AUREUS USA600

32:17.536 --> 32:19.308
IS AN ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANT
INFECTION

32:19.308 --> 32:21.140
WITH A RANGE OF SYMPTOMS

32:21.140 --> 32:22.571
FROM SIMPLE SKIN RASHES

32:22.571 --> 32:24.543
TO FATAL SEPSIS.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.616
WE HAVE TRACED THE SOURCE
OF THE INFECTION TO ONE DOCTOR.

32:27.616 --> 32:29.278
DR. MIRANDA BAILEY

32:29.278 --> 32:32.281
IS A CARRIER OF MRSA USA600.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.527
BUT THE REAL CULPRIT HERE
IS THE GLOVES.

32:38.527 --> 32:40.389
RECORDS SHOW
THE SURGICAL GLOVES

32:40.389 --> 32:43.132
IN USE AT THE TIME OF OUTBREAK,
MARCH 15,

32:43.132 --> 32:44.363
SHIPPED FROM THE MANUFACTURER

32:44.363 --> 32:47.196
HEMMING SYNTHETICS,
INCORPORATED.

32:47.196 --> 32:48.567
(Owen) WE SWITCHED

32:48.567 --> 32:52.501
TO HEMMING'S GLOVES
WHEN PEGASUS WAS HERE.

32:52.501 --> 32:55.104
(man) OUR TESTING REVEALS
MANUFACTURING DEFECTS.

32:55.104 --> 32:57.406
MICROSCOPIC TEARS IN THE GLOVES,
WHICH FACILITATED

32:57.406 --> 33:00.479
THE TRANSMISSION
OF STAPH USA600

33:00.479 --> 33:02.511
TO DR. BAILEY'S PATIENTS.

33:02.511 --> 33:05.014
IT IS
THE C.D.C.'s DETERMINATION,

33:05.014 --> 33:06.485
WERE IT NOT
FOR THE DEFECTIVE GLOVES,

33:06.485 --> 33:09.188
THE PATIENTS IN QUESTION
WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN INFECTED.

33:09.188 --> 33:12.291
AS FOR DR. BAILEY, WE RECOMMEND
ERADICATION MEASURES

33:12.291 --> 33:15.264
BEFORE SHE CAN GO BACK
TO ANY KIND OF PATIENT CARE.

33:15.264 --> 33:17.226
ALL RIGHT.
(sighs) THANK GOD.

33:17.226 --> 33:19.668
BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME.

33:22.631 --> 33:24.033
(door opens)

33:24.033 --> 33:26.675
HERE ARE COPIES OF OUR REPORT.

33:26.675 --> 33:31.180

33:35.044 --> 33:37.386

33:37.386 --> 33:40.249
(TV playing indistinctly)

33:43.092 --> 33:45.054
WHAT'S THIS?

33:45.054 --> 33:46.295
IT'S A PRESS RELEASE.

33:46.295 --> 33:47.596
WE'RE PUTTING IT OUT
IN THE MORNING,

33:47.596 --> 33:49.498
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE 12 HOURS
TO SCOOP THE "TIMES"

33:49.498 --> 33:51.630

33:51.630 --> 33:52.761

33:52.761 --> 33:55.104
HEY.

33:55.104 --> 33:56.435
BE AWESOME.

33:56.435 --> 33:58.537
(both laugh)

33:58.537 --> 34:00.639
WAIT. I HAVE A QUESTION.

34:00.639 --> 34:02.271
(exhales deeply) ONE.

34:02.271 --> 34:03.472
AND I HAVE A FOLLOW-UP.

34:03.472 --> 34:05.474
UH...

34:05.474 --> 34:07.116

34:07.116 --> 34:09.448

DEFECTIVE GLOVES.

34:09.448 --> 34:11.350
I HEARD. THAT'S GREAT.

34:11.350 --> 34:13.182
YEAH.

34:13.182 --> 34:16.155
(indistinct conversations)

34:16.155 --> 34:17.656
YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:17.656 --> 34:20.589
I SPENT MY ENTIRE DAY GETTING
TREATED LIKE THE BAD GUY.

34:20.589 --> 34:22.661
I'M NOT GONNA
DO THIS WITH YOU ANYMORE.

34:22.661 --> 34:25.334
YOU WANT TO FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT WHAT WE DID? GO AHEAD.

34:25.334 --> 34:26.595
JUST LEAVE ME OUT OF IT.

34:26.595 --> 34:28.066
(scoffs)

34:28.066 --> 34:30.499
I DIDN'T FORCE YOU
TO DO ANYTHING.

34:30.499 --> 34:33.402
I'M SORRY THAT YOU'RE HURT.
OKAY?

34:33.402 --> 34:35.674
I'M SORRY THAT MATTHEW
BROKE UP WITH YOU.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.776
AS FAR
AS US SLEEPING TOGETHER,

34:37.776 --> 34:40.349
I'M NEVER GONNA BE SORRY
ABOUT THAT.

34:43.152 --> 34:44.813
(Matthew) APRIL?

34:47.756 --> 34:49.758
ANYWAY...

34:49.758 --> 34:51.820
GOOD NIGHT.

34:54.793 --> 34:57.466
UH...

34:57.466 --> 34:59.868
I'M SORRY.

34:59.868 --> 35:04.503
WHAT? NO.
NO, NO. I-I AM SORRY.

35:04.503 --> 35:07.206
YOU--YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE SORRY ABOUT.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.637
NO, YOU MADE A MISTAKE,

35:08.637 --> 35:11.210
AND YOU ASKED FOR
A DO-OVER.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.511
WELL,
I MADE A MISTAKE, TOO.

35:12.511 --> 35:15.514
I WAS HURT
AND I ACTED LIKE AN IDIOT.

35:15.514 --> 35:16.645
(huffs)

35:16.645 --> 35:19.888
I-I WAS HOPING, UM...

35:19.888 --> 35:21.650
YOU COULD FORGIVE ME,

35:21.650 --> 35:23.852
THAT I COULD HAVE
A DO-OVER.

35:25.794 --> 35:28.126
(exhales deeply)

35:28.126 --> 35:29.198
YES.

35:29.198 --> 35:30.829

35:43.642 --> 35:44.773
(woman shouts indistinctly)

35:54.923 --> 35:57.426
IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED
TO ANY ONE OF US, BAILEY.

35:57.426 --> 36:00.689
WE'LL GET YOU TREATED,
GET YOU CLEARED--

36:00.689 --> 36:03.292
I KILLED TWO PATIENTS.
NO.

36:03.292 --> 36:04.663
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

36:04.663 --> 36:08.237
YOU SCRUBBED PROPERLY,
YOU GLOVED--

36:08.237 --> 36:10.799
HOW'S SETH LEPIK?

36:15.644 --> 36:16.945
I LOST HIM.

36:16.945 --> 36:18.777
(exhales)

36:18.777 --> 36:21.310
THE INFECTION FORMED
AN ABSCESS THAT...

36:21.310 --> 36:22.681
(whimpers)

36:22.681 --> 36:25.614
ERODED INTO
HIS INNOMINATE VEIN.

36:25.614 --> 36:27.286
(crying)

36:27.286 --> 36:29.288
I'M SO SORRY.

36:29.288 --> 36:30.889
(continues crying)

36:30.889 --> 36:32.421
BAILEY, HOW CAN I--

36:32.421 --> 36:34.663
NO! NOW YOU WANT TO HELP ME?

36:34.663 --> 36:37.226
WHERE WERE YOU
WHEN MY PATIENT WAS ALIVE,

36:37.226 --> 36:38.927
WHEN I COULD'VE HELPED HIM?

36:38.927 --> 36:42.431
YOU SHUT ME OUT.
YOU LEFT ME.

36:42.431 --> 36:44.533
BAILEY, I WAS TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU. THAT'S ALL.

36:44.533 --> 36:45.904
I'M--
NO, NO, THE HOSPITAL.

36:45.904 --> 36:48.337
YOU WERE TRYING TO PROTECT
THE HOSPITAL.

36:48.337 --> 36:49.938
IT'S ALL THAT MATTERS
TO YOU.

36:49.938 --> 36:53.512
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY
I'M SO SURPRISED.

36:53.512 --> 36:56.915
ADELE COMPLAINED ABOUT THAT
EVERY TIME I SAW HER.

36:56.915 --> 36:58.617
AND I PROTECTED YOU.

36:58.617 --> 37:02.220
I-I MADE EXCUSES TO HER
FOR YOU.

37:02.220 --> 37:04.453
I STOOD BY YOU--
BAILEY--

37:04.453 --> 37:05.794
NO, YOU WERE A DRUNK.

37:05.794 --> 37:08.957
YOU WERE OPERATING
ON YOUR PATIENTS DRUNK,

37:08.957 --> 37:10.499
AND I STOOD BY YOU.

37:10.499 --> 37:12.961
I EXPECTED THE SAME
FROM YOU.

37:12.961 --> 37:14.663
I DESERVED IT.
I EARNED IT.
