WEBVTT

00:00.918 --> 00:03.420
(Drum roll, bird chirps)

00:04.046 --> 00:05.964
- Oh, Bev I'm sorry
I missed you,

00:06.006 --> 00:08.258
but I'm so happy
I got your voicemail!

00:08.300 --> 00:09.968
Wondering when you might
be getatable

00:10.010 --> 00:13.180
for a little red biddy,
little back chat? Hm?

00:13.222 --> 00:15.933
Oh, and we're moving
to New York.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.519
I Just thought it was time.
Ciao.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.982
- Don't tell me you're having
lunch with Bev

00:24.024 --> 00:26.276
after all this.
- Imagine?

00:26.318 --> 00:28.487
No, I amputated those people
years ago.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.948
But Bev and her big bazoo
will get the word out

00:30.989 --> 00:33.158
quicker than any group
memorandum.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.952
- Well, that's a relief.

00:34.993 --> 00:37.204
Kids! Breakfast is served.

00:38.205 --> 00:40.040
- I already ate. Oh.

00:41.333 --> 00:43.210
- I don't see any breakfast.
- Mimosas!

00:43.252 --> 00:45.128
We're celebrating!

00:45.170 --> 00:47.339
Ruth sent over a bottle
of champagne.

00:47.381 --> 00:49.174
- So there's no food then?

00:49.216 --> 00:51.218
- Would you look at this
family?

00:51.260 --> 00:53.387
Alexis, pursuing a career in PR.

00:53.428 --> 00:56.473
- Hm.
David, expanding his business.

00:56.515 --> 00:57.808
- Hm.

00:57.850 --> 01:01.687
- Moira, I have no doubt
Broadway will be calling,

01:01.728 --> 01:04.314
or maybe a pledge drive on PBS.

01:04.356 --> 01:06.275
- (Chuckles) Oh, you are sweet.

01:06.316 --> 01:09.027
- I say we do something
as a family tonight.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.946
Maybe cook a little something?

01:10.988 --> 01:12.573
- No. I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:12.614 --> 01:15.075
- Absolutely not.
- I mean, look around, family.

01:15.117 --> 01:18.203
This won't be our home
for too much longer.

01:19.705 --> 01:21.540
(Silence)

01:23.792 --> 01:25.586
So let's celebrate.

01:27.129 --> 01:28.755
Picture.
- Hm.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.507
- Let's raise those glasses.

01:32.676 --> 01:34.219
David? You don't have to look
quite so morose.

01:34.261 --> 01:35.971
You're with your family.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.347
- (Small chuckle)
- (Camera clicks)

01:37.389 --> 01:40.184
Ah, now that's a framer.
(Laughs)

01:40.225 --> 01:42.269
(Phone makes a sound)
- You just deleted it.

01:42.311 --> 01:43.729
- What's that?
- (Disappointed groans)

01:43.770 --> 01:48.442
♪♪♪

01:50.152 --> 01:51.653
(Dog barks in the distance)

01:51.695 --> 01:53.864
- (Sighs) Is it just me, John,
or does the air not have

01:53.906 --> 01:55.908
a particularly lovely
redolence today.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.242
- Oh.

01:57.284 --> 01:59.661
- Do I detect a scintilla
of lavender?

01:59.703 --> 02:01.788
- Isn't it funny how the air
suddenly smells sweeter

02:01.830 --> 02:03.582
now that you know
we're leaving.

02:03.624 --> 02:05.584
Still doesn't feel real.

02:05.626 --> 02:09.004
(Loud honk)

02:09.046 --> 02:10.422
(Door shuts)

02:12.716 --> 02:15.594
- Roland, you bought a new
truck?

02:15.636 --> 02:18.430
- Well, Johnny, if you wanna be
an executive,

02:19.515 --> 02:21.767
you gotta drive
like an executive.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.269
- It might be a bit premature
spending all this money.

02:24.311 --> 02:26.438
- Well, what's the point of
having a regular paycheque

02:26.480 --> 02:29.191
if you can't have a little fun
with it, right?

02:29.233 --> 02:32.152
- I went to the spa.
Had a pedicure and a blow-out,

02:32.194 --> 02:34.905
at the same time. (Laughs)

02:34.947 --> 02:36.990
I'm surprised I didn't see
you there, Moira,

02:37.032 --> 02:39.493
celebrating your big
"Sunrise Bay" news.

02:39.535 --> 02:41.954
- And what would that
communiqué entail?

02:41.995 --> 02:43.455
- The reboot!

02:43.497 --> 02:45.499
Don't tell me
I'm the first person

02:45.541 --> 02:47.209
to congratulate you!

02:47.251 --> 02:50.003
- So it's a go. Um no, uh,

02:50.045 --> 02:52.798
unfortunately, I won't be
participating in that

02:52.840 --> 02:54.967
little vanity project.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.177
Best to keep ones gaze
on the horizon,

02:57.219 --> 02:59.263
not the posterior view.

02:59.304 --> 03:00.848
- Sure.
- Oh, Honey,

03:00.889 --> 03:02.391
I think we better get going.

03:02.432 --> 03:04.309
I gotta get the truck back
to the dealership.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.478
I told the salesman I was just
taking it around the block.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.772
But then I thought,
maybe some cinnamon buns

03:08.814 --> 03:11.483
might just buy us a sun roof.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.151
(Laughing)
- Bye.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.195
- Here, Honey,
you hold the buns.

03:16.655 --> 03:18.615
- I thought they might have
at least called

03:18.657 --> 03:20.409
to say they were moving on.

03:20.450 --> 03:21.702
- (Sighs)

03:21.743 --> 03:23.745
Big things are coming your way,
Sweetheart.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.706
Don't you worry.
- Okay.

03:25.747 --> 03:29.042
I don't. Worry is but
undernourished enthusiasm.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.505
(Door opens, shuts)

03:35.257 --> 03:36.884
- Hello.

03:36.925 --> 03:38.677
- Something's different.

03:39.803 --> 03:41.972
Your... hair.

03:42.014 --> 03:44.224
- Is in a ponytail
because I didn't wash it.

03:44.266 --> 03:46.268
- Oh. Okay. It just sort
of looks like

03:46.310 --> 03:48.520
since you got the deal
you've decided to dress

03:48.562 --> 03:50.105
more professionally.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.025
- Can I help you with something
in particular, or...

03:53.066 --> 03:54.693
- Uh, actually, yes.

03:54.735 --> 03:56.570
I need your advice.
- Hm.

03:56.612 --> 04:00.073
- What says, "Patrick, you're
gonna love New York" more:

04:00.115 --> 04:03.952
a gift card to Joe's Pizza
or tickets to "Wicked"?

04:03.994 --> 04:06.330
- You're taking Patrick
on a trip to New York?

04:06.371 --> 04:09.416
- Uh, no. We're moving there
with all of you!

04:09.458 --> 04:11.460
What? Do you think we're gonna
stay here all by ourselves?

04:11.502 --> 04:14.713
- I'm not moving to New York,
David.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.131
- What?

04:16.173 --> 04:18.592
- We decided that Roland and I
would stay here.

04:18.634 --> 04:21.720
And I'm gonna travel around
and set up all the new motels.

04:21.762 --> 04:24.306
I mean, I realized I didn't
need to live in a big city.

04:24.348 --> 04:27.851
I guess I just needed
to know that I could.

04:27.893 --> 04:29.937
- Mhmm.

04:29.978 --> 04:33.065
- So I take it you didn't
like the house?

04:34.233 --> 04:35.567
- What house?
- What?

04:36.735 --> 04:38.362
- What house?

04:38.403 --> 04:41.615
- Patrick may have been looking
at a house for the two of you.

04:42.866 --> 04:44.576
He didn't say anything
about that?

04:44.618 --> 04:46.662
- Uh, No.
Like-like to buy?

04:47.871 --> 04:49.957
- He said that you guys had
driven by it a bunch of times.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.252
- That house is for sale?

04:53.293 --> 04:55.921
- No. I don't know. I--

04:55.963 --> 04:57.840
Can we stop talking about this?

04:57.881 --> 04:59.466
I feel like I'm doing
something wrong.

05:04.847 --> 05:07.140
So you're finally getting out.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.603
- Yeah. Um...

05:12.855 --> 05:15.357
I should probably go
talk to my husband.

05:15.399 --> 05:16.900
- Okay.

05:19.194 --> 05:20.988
(Door opens, shuts)

05:22.906 --> 05:25.075
(Bell jingles over door)

05:25.117 --> 05:26.410
(Low hum of chatter,
radio plays)

05:26.702 --> 05:29.454
- Oh, Alexis, garbage day is
the same for the whole street.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.665
You didn't need to bring your
garbage all the way here.

05:31.707 --> 05:34.626
- Um, I brought my garbage
here for a reason.

05:36.086 --> 05:39.423
I thought you might like
to wear some of it.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.008
- What?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.634
- As you know, David and I
are sharing an apartment

05:42.676 --> 05:45.470
in New York, so I'm like
downsizing a little bit.

05:45.512 --> 05:48.473
- I can't take all of this,
Alexis.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.518
Maybe we can do another swap?

05:51.560 --> 05:53.478
Or, or, why don't I just go
through it

05:53.520 --> 05:55.147
and pay for the ones
I wanna keep?

05:55.189 --> 05:57.065
- No, Twy, I can't take your
money.

05:57.107 --> 05:58.901
I've seen how people tip here.

05:58.942 --> 06:00.485
- Alexis, between us,

06:00.527 --> 06:02.321
I don't do this job
for the money.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.323
- Okay, well, if you don't do
this for money

06:04.364 --> 06:06.533
I'm scared to know what you do
do for money.

06:11.581 --> 06:13.875
- Okay, now that you're leaving,

06:15.084 --> 06:16.586
can you keep a secret?

06:16.627 --> 06:18.921
- Depends on how dark
it's gonna get, but yes.

06:20.673 --> 06:23.176
- I won some money in the
lottery a few years ago.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.052
- Oh my God, Twy! Go you!

06:26.512 --> 06:28.639
Why did you not tell me
this before?

06:28.681 --> 06:30.558
- Well, because you guys
had just gotten here

06:30.600 --> 06:32.351
and, and you had just lost
all your money.

06:32.393 --> 06:33.311
Well, what was I gonna say?

06:33.352 --> 06:35.521
I just won $92 million?

06:36.814 --> 06:39.275
- You won $92 million?

06:39.317 --> 06:41.777
- Oh, no. Sorry.
- Okay.

06:41.819 --> 06:44.697
Okay, because I literally
was about to pass out.

06:44.739 --> 06:47.700
- Yeah. No, no. I split the
$92 million with another guy.

06:50.620 --> 06:52.538
- So you won like...

06:52.580 --> 06:54.916
(Struggling with the math)
S-so much money.

06:54.957 --> 06:57.335
- Shh. I just--

06:57.376 --> 06:59.754
I just don't want anyone know.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.797
It changes things.

07:01.839 --> 07:03.591
- Twy, what are you doing here?

07:03.633 --> 07:06.052
You could be anywhere,
doing anything.

07:06.093 --> 07:08.721
- I have everything I need
right here.

07:08.763 --> 07:10.473
And if I've learned anything

07:10.515 --> 07:12.475
from how my mom spent
the money I gave her,

07:12.517 --> 07:14.685
it's that money can buy
a lot of snowmobiles,

07:14.727 --> 07:16.354
but it can't buy happiness.

07:16.395 --> 07:18.564
So it's about how you live
your life.

07:18.606 --> 07:21.150
You know,
doing what makes you smile.

07:21.192 --> 07:24.612
And being here, getting
to hear your stories

07:24.654 --> 07:26.697
over the past few years,

07:26.739 --> 07:28.658
even the scary ones,

07:31.619 --> 07:33.663
that makes me smile.

07:33.704 --> 07:35.581
- Twy,

07:35.623 --> 07:38.334
you might be the best person
I know,

07:38.376 --> 07:41.712
but as someone who has had
a lot of money

07:41.754 --> 07:45.091
and then not had it and
now is like still pretty poor,

07:45.132 --> 07:47.134
but somewhat okay?

07:47.176 --> 07:48.386
Every now and again,

07:48.427 --> 07:50.388
spending like a little bit
of money

07:50.429 --> 07:53.057
on something really special,

07:53.099 --> 07:55.434
it might not buy you happiness,

07:55.476 --> 07:59.272
but it can definitely
help make you smile.

08:01.732 --> 08:03.276
- (Small laugh)

08:09.094 --> 08:11.639
This cute dress makes me smile.

08:11.680 --> 08:12.973
- Hm.
- (Twyla laughs)

08:13.015 --> 08:15.184
- Not quite sure how
that one got in there.

08:15.225 --> 08:17.686
But anything else in there
is yours if you want it.

08:19.188 --> 08:20.814
(Bag rustles)

08:24.652 --> 08:26.695
(Gasps) Aw!

08:28.489 --> 08:30.658
- There you go.

08:30.699 --> 08:32.743
- John, considering I'll
have some time to fritter

08:32.785 --> 08:34.787
once we're there,
do you think you might

08:34.828 --> 08:37.081
want to put me to work?
- Well, I didn't know

08:37.122 --> 08:38.832
that would be of interest
to you, Moira.

08:38.874 --> 08:41.085
But I'll see if I can get you
something.

08:41.126 --> 08:43.003
Remember when you were
the Rose Video spokesperson

08:43.045 --> 08:45.297
that one year?
- How could I not?

08:45.339 --> 08:49.051
Oh, that photo of me sunbathing
atop a giant VHS tape,

08:49.093 --> 08:51.887
was a staple of Times Square
for a whole season.

08:51.929 --> 08:54.014
- (Chuckles)
- What do you have there?

08:54.056 --> 08:55.516
- Well, I don't know,
it's for you.

08:55.557 --> 08:56.892
- Oh.

09:02.439 --> 09:04.275
Oh, it's from Tippy.

09:04.316 --> 09:05.776
(reads) "Dear Moira.
You win.

09:05.818 --> 09:07.820
Welcome back to the Bay."

09:13.284 --> 09:16.036
John, it's a... tennis bracelet.

09:16.078 --> 09:18.956
- What tennis bracelet?
- My tennis bracelet.

09:20.249 --> 09:22.167
(Phone rings)

09:24.420 --> 09:25.921
It's Tippy.

09:25.963 --> 09:28.299
(Beeps phone on)
Tippy.

09:28.340 --> 09:30.217
Yes, I just received it.

09:30.259 --> 09:32.803
Please, tell me this is not
some barbarous jape.

09:33.971 --> 09:36.181
Yes. Yes.

09:37.725 --> 09:40.311
My answer is a yes!

09:40.352 --> 09:42.855
A clangorous, vociferous YES.

09:45.316 --> 09:47.568
Thank you.
Thank you.

09:47.610 --> 09:49.528
- What's all that about?

09:49.570 --> 09:51.113
- "Sunrise Bay."

09:52.489 --> 09:56.702
Wow. When forced to choose
between Clifton and myself,

09:56.744 --> 09:59.163
they decided mine
was the bigger name.

10:00.331 --> 10:02.166
- What?!
- Yeah.

10:02.207 --> 10:03.667
- So it's happening?

10:03.709 --> 10:05.961
(Laughing)
- Yes. Oh, John.

10:06.003 --> 10:07.921
Thirteen episode order.

10:07.963 --> 10:09.757
They've already sent through
two scripts.

10:09.798 --> 10:12.051
And-and I have to start
in two weeks!

10:12.092 --> 10:13.761
- (Laughing)

10:15.054 --> 10:17.556

screaming about?

10:21.644 --> 10:23.062

10:23.103 --> 10:25.522

- Even the bracelet.

10:25.564 --> 10:27.608
- And you're giving it to me?

10:27.650 --> 10:30.152
- No, there are 30 diamonds
on that thing.

10:32.571 --> 10:35.240
- Our offices will be
in New York.

10:35.282 --> 10:38.786

for a tricky commute.

flattering things to say

happy to help.

- Hm.

11:06.772 --> 11:09.650
Why didn't you tell me
about the house?

11:12.069 --> 11:14.363
- I um,

11:14.405 --> 11:18.284
I was gonna wait until after
the wedding to tell you.

11:18.325 --> 11:19.660
- Hm.

11:19.702 --> 11:21.120

you can get

thing on your plate.

11:22.955 --> 11:25.291

11:25.332 --> 11:26.709

Yeah, and then New York
happened and...

kinda pointless.

even go up for sale?

11:35.926 --> 11:37.803
- Well, technically,
it didn't,

11:37.845 --> 11:39.847
but after the fourth time
that we drove by it,

11:39.888 --> 11:42.683
and you commented that it
reminded you

11:42.725 --> 11:45.019
of Kate Winslet's cottage
from "The Holiday".

11:45.060 --> 11:47.354
I just knocked on the door
and asked them to call me

11:47.396 --> 11:49.189
if they ever decided to sell.

11:49.231 --> 11:50.941
Turns out their daughters
are off to college,

11:50.983 --> 11:52.943
and they're moving to Florida.

11:52.985 --> 11:55.988
- So that's why you were
so reluctant to move.

11:56.030 --> 11:58.032
- It's just hard to picture
living someplace

11:58.073 --> 12:00.034
you've never even visited.

12:00.075 --> 12:02.036
And I always thought you
didn't like New York.

12:02.077 --> 12:05.539
- Um, no, uh, I love New York.

12:05.581 --> 12:08.751
It was just a weird time
in my life.

moving somewhere

to being there.

12:19.803 --> 12:21.388

the business up

12:21.430 --> 12:23.015
to a much larger market.

12:23.057 --> 12:25.392
I'd finally get to see a game
at Yankee Stadium.

12:25.434 --> 12:27.936
- Yeah, and by then you'll
have met some people

12:27.978 --> 12:30.064
that would go
and do that with you.

12:32.650 --> 12:34.318
- It's gonna be a tough
goodbye.

12:34.360 --> 12:35.653
- Hm.

our life together.

our support for your move

12:57.800 --> 12:59.259
to the Big Apple!

12:59.301 --> 13:00.844
- Yeah, we heard that
"Sunrise Bay"

13:00.886 --> 13:02.930
was moving on without you,
but who needs them?

13:02.972 --> 13:05.599

on their two-bit show.

13:10.980 --> 13:13.899
- Yeah, and reboots are never
as good as the original.

13:13.941 --> 13:18.112
- Well, aren't you a wolf pack
by which any gal

13:18.153 --> 13:20.447

to be protected.

13:20.489 --> 13:22.032

to disperse to new territory.

13:24.368 --> 13:28.163
"Sunrise Bay" called with
an irresistible offer.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.459

20:29.493 --> 20:31.078
- Okay. So what are the plans
for tonight?

20:31.119 --> 20:33.121
Because I might be meeting Twy
for a drink.

20:33.163 --> 20:35.290
- Well, I thought we'd
all stay in tonight,

20:35.332 --> 20:37.793
and enjoy the pizza
and play charades?

20:37.834 --> 20:39.336
- Charades.

20:39.378 --> 20:41.255
I'm going to have to gracefully
bow out.

20:41.296 --> 20:43.924
I don't think you can
afford my quote anymore.

20:43.966 --> 20:45.425
Both: (Laughing)

20:45.467 --> 20:47.928
- Just saying it out loud
makes it so real.

20:47.970 --> 20:51.181
- Well, I suppose I should
let you both know

20:51.223 --> 20:53.475
that there's been a slight
change of plans.

20:53.517 --> 20:56.270
As you've heard, your mother
is going back to work.

20:56.311 --> 20:58.021
- (Claps)

20:58.063 --> 21:00.941
- And we'll be heading
to California.

21:00.983 --> 21:02.568
Now, I've I made some calls

21:02.609 --> 21:05.404
and I'll be setting up shop
out west for the time being.

21:05.445 --> 21:07.489
- Ooh, so it's just David
and me

21:07.531 --> 21:09.157
going to New York then?

21:10.367 --> 21:11.994
- Um...

21:13.537 --> 21:15.914
I have something to say.

21:15.956 --> 21:18.083
- The wedding's off.
- No. The wedding is not--

21:18.125 --> 21:20.210
Why would the wedding be off?

21:21.420 --> 21:23.714
Patrick found us a house.

21:23.755 --> 21:26.717
- Okay, I don't know how
we'd be able to afford a house.

21:26.758 --> 21:29.011
- The house is here.

21:30.804 --> 21:32.723
I think we're going to stay.

21:32.764 --> 21:34.725
- What?
Moira: David,

21:34.766 --> 21:36.852
are sure you've given
this sentencing

21:36.894 --> 21:38.896
adequate deliberation?

21:38.937 --> 21:41.690
- I just don't think
I'm finished with this place.

21:41.732 --> 21:44.276
My business is here.

21:44.318 --> 21:45.819
My...

21:45.861 --> 21:47.863
my husband is here.

21:49.323 --> 21:51.408
And I'm just not ready
to mess that up...

21:51.450 --> 21:53.118
just yet.

21:55.245 --> 21:58.040
I'm sorry, I said I would
share a place with you.

21:59.333 --> 22:03.003
- So does this mean you'll be
coming with us, Alexis?

22:03.045 --> 22:05.672
- Um, no.

22:07.007 --> 22:09.635
I think it means that I'm gonna
be flying solo to New York.

22:09.676 --> 22:12.012
I've done it before,
and I can do it again.

22:12.054 --> 22:14.264
- You take that ember
of independence

22:14.306 --> 22:16.099
and you keep it burning.

22:16.141 --> 22:19.895
Because you, my darling,
are destined to be on fire!

22:19.937 --> 22:23.398
- Well, I could not be more
proud of my family

22:23.440 --> 22:25.025
than I am right now.

22:25.067 --> 22:28.987
And as much as I'll miss this -
being together -

22:30.113 --> 22:32.658
at least I can go to sleep
knowing

22:32.699 --> 22:34.785
we're all gonna be okay.

22:34.826 --> 22:36.578
(Emotional sniffling)

22:37.538 --> 22:39.414
- So when are you leaving?

22:39.456 --> 22:41.542
- September 3rd.

22:41.583 --> 22:43.335
- That's my wedding day.

22:46.713 --> 22:48.507
- And we're tied to the third?

22:48.549 --> 22:51.009
- Oh Moira...
- Am I tied to the third?

22:51.051 --> 22:53.637
- Of course you're getting
married on the third, David.

22:53.679 --> 22:55.639
Moira, we can leave first
thing the next morning.

22:55.681 --> 22:57.266
- Yes. We will, John.

22:57.307 --> 22:59.935
It's just worth noting that
the lie-flat seats were only

22:59.977 --> 23:01.645
on the evening flight.
- Moira.

23:01.687 --> 23:03.647
- It's okay.
- Unbelievable.

23:05.315 --> 23:07.067
(Door slams)
- Okay.

23:07.109 --> 23:08.652
(Nervous exhale)

23:08.694 --> 23:10.863
- David, what is going on?

23:10.904 --> 23:12.531
- You're wearing a blindfold.

23:12.573 --> 23:14.116
I'm not just gonna tell you
what's going on.

23:15.534 --> 23:18.495
- (Clears throat)
- Okay. You can take it off now.

23:18.537 --> 23:21.081
(Birds chirp)
(Dog barks in the distance)

23:21.123 --> 23:22.749
- Hmm.

23:24.293 --> 23:27.087
Hey, you do know that I've
already seen this house, right?

23:27.129 --> 23:29.631
- I do.

23:29.673 --> 23:31.633
- So then why are we here?

23:32.676 --> 23:34.636
- Because I put an offer in.

23:34.678 --> 23:36.471
And they accepted.

23:37.681 --> 23:39.641
- What?
What about New York?

23:39.683 --> 23:41.435
I thought that's where
you wanted to be?

23:41.476 --> 23:42.811
- I thought so, too.

23:42.853 --> 23:45.230
But it's not where
you wanna be.

23:45.272 --> 23:47.900
And I don't wanna be anywhere
you don't wanna be.

23:49.234 --> 23:51.778
- David, I promise I will make
you so happy here.

23:51.820 --> 23:53.697
- You fuckin' better.

24:01.705 --> 24:03.707
- Wait. So when you say
you put an offer in...

24:03.749 --> 24:06.126
- Yes.
- what exactly did you do?

24:06.168 --> 24:08.462
- Um, I don't really know.

24:08.503 --> 24:10.714
You might wanna call them.
Call the people.

24:10.756 --> 24:12.883
- Yeah, no. I'm definitely
gonna look at that offer.

24:12.925 --> 24:14.509
- Mhmm.

24:15.636 --> 24:17.137
- You know, at this point
who even needs a wedding,

24:17.179 --> 24:18.305
am I right?
- Oh, I do.

24:18.347 --> 24:20.015
I need a wedding. Big time.
