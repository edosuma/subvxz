09:13.509 --> 09:16.207
'CAUSE, BAILEY,
MY CAR'S GOING TO
COST $300 MINIMUM.

09:16.207 --> 09:18.035
FOR A BATTERY?

09:18.035 --> 09:20.385
NO OFFENSE, BUT SOMEBODY'S
REALLY RIPPING YOU OFF.

09:20.385 --> 09:22.387
IT WASN'T
THE BATTERY, OK?
IT WAS THE STARTER.

09:22.387 --> 09:24.433
AND IF YOU HAD HUNG
AROUND LONG ENOUGH--

09:24.433 --> 09:26.087
OK, LOOK,
I SAID I'M SORRY, OK?

09:26.087 --> 09:27.958
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?

09:27.958 --> 09:29.090
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

09:29.090 --> 09:30.918
I WANT YOU
TO GO UPSTAIRS,

09:30.918 --> 09:32.746
AND I WANT YOU TO
GET OUR MONEY BACK.

09:32.746 --> 09:33.964
I CAN'T DO THAT.

09:33.964 --> 09:35.313
FINE, THEN I WILL.

09:35.313 --> 09:37.098
NO, NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT.

09:37.098 --> 09:39.187
WAIT A SECOND, SARAH.

09:39.187 --> 09:42.320
LOOK, LET'S BE
REASONABLE
ABOUT THIS, OK?

09:42.320 --> 09:44.714
THERE ARE WAYS
THAT WE CAN MAKE
BACK THIS MONEY.

09:44.714 --> 09:45.585
HERE.

09:48.065 --> 09:51.939
APARTMENT 11 HAS GOT
A LEAKY FLUSH BALL.

09:51.939 --> 09:54.506
MRS. MISHLER NEEDS
HER NEW DOOR HINGE.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.334
DONNA JEAN AND GEORGE
WANT A NEW DEADBOLT,

09:56.334 --> 09:57.945
AND THEY HAVE
2 CLOGGED DRAINS.

09:57.945 --> 10:00.164
THAT'S--WHAT IS THAT?
THAT'S...

10:00.164 --> 10:01.557
A START.

10:05.474 --> 10:09.391
Claudia: HOW ABOUT
STANDS WITH A FIST?

10:09.391 --> 10:12.960
HOW ABOUT STANDS
WITH DIFFICULTY?

10:12.960 --> 10:14.352
HOW ABOUT NINA?

10:14.352 --> 10:16.354
WE'RE NOT NAMING
THE BIRD, GUYS.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.965
WHY NOT? NINA SAID--

10:17.965 --> 10:19.357
BECAUSE IF YOU NAME IT,

10:19.357 --> 10:21.359
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
ATTACHED TO IT.

10:21.359 --> 10:22.752
AND CONTRARY
TO PROFESSIONAL OPINION,

10:22.752 --> 10:24.885
I DON'T THINK--

10:24.885 --> 10:27.888
I JUST DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD GET OUR
HOPES UP THAT HIGH.

10:27.888 --> 10:30.455
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
THE BIRD, IS IT,
CHARLIE?

10:30.455 --> 10:32.327
HUH?

10:32.327 --> 10:35.373
LOOK AT YOU.
YOU'RE A MESS. YOU--

10:35.373 --> 10:38.376
DID SOMETHING
HAPPEN WITH NINA?

10:38.376 --> 10:40.248
I'M CHOPPING ONIONS,
CLAUDIA.

10:40.248 --> 10:41.684
YOU'RE UPSET,
ADMIT IT.

10:43.991 --> 10:47.995
OK, YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHY I'M UPSET?

10:47.995 --> 10:50.388
THIS WOMAN,
SHE'S GREAT WITH OWEN.

10:50.388 --> 10:53.304
SHE WON'T LET ME
PICK A FIGHT.

10:53.304 --> 10:55.959
SHE KNOWS, LIKE,
WHO TO ROOT FOR

10:55.959 --> 10:58.135
BETWEEN THE SERBIANS
AND THE CROATIANS.

10:58.135 --> 11:00.311
PLUS SHE QUOTES YARD STATS
FOR THE 49ers.

11:00.311 --> 11:01.661
SO WHAT'S THE PROBLEM,
CHARLIE?

11:01.661 --> 11:03.445
THE PROBLEM IS--

11:03.445 --> 11:05.403
THE PROBLEM IS
THERE HAVEN'T BEEN
ANY PROBLEMS...

11:05.403 --> 11:08.015
UNTIL NOW,
BECAUSE MY NAME
IS CHARLIE SALINGER.

11:08.015 --> 11:09.407
SO SOMETHING
HAD TO GO WRONG.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.235
SOMETHING HAD
TO COME BETWEEN US.

11:11.235 --> 11:12.410
LIKE WHAT?

11:12.410 --> 11:14.325
LIKE CHINA.

11:14.325 --> 11:15.762
THE WHOLE COUNTRY?

11:15.762 --> 11:17.415
SHE'S GOING THERE
FOR 2 MONTHS.

11:17.415 --> 11:19.330
SO WHAT?
YOU CAN WRITE.

11:19.330 --> 11:20.723
WHAT?
CLAUDIA.

11:20.723 --> 11:22.899
WE'RE NOT NAMING THE BIRD!

11:59.240 --> 12:02.199
AS SOON AS WE GET
THE CATALOGUE PROOFED,
I'LL GET A COPY TO YOU.

12:02.199 --> 12:03.635
RIGHT.

12:05.072 --> 12:06.334
RIGHT, THANKS.

12:09.119 --> 12:10.468
WE, UH--

12:10.468 --> 12:12.383
WE'RE LETTING
YOU GO, JULIA.

12:14.211 --> 12:15.343
WHAT?

12:16.866 --> 12:17.998
WHY?

12:17.998 --> 12:20.087
WORK ISSUES,

12:20.087 --> 12:22.219
PERFORMANCE ISSUES.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.438
WAIT A SECOND.

12:23.438 --> 12:25.092
YOU'RE SAYING--

12:25.092 --> 12:26.920
THAT ISN'T REALLY--

12:26.920 --> 12:30.924
YOU'RE FIRING ME BECAUSE
I WOULDN'T LET YOU KISS ME?

12:30.924 --> 12:32.229
NO, THAT IS NOT
THE REASON.

12:32.229 --> 12:33.491
REALLY? REALLY?

12:33.491 --> 12:35.102
SO IT'S JUST
A COINCIDENCE

12:35.102 --> 12:36.494
WHAT HAPPENED
IN THE PARKING LOT?

12:36.494 --> 12:37.974
OK, YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT IT IS?

12:37.974 --> 12:39.280
I DON'T LIKE YOU,

12:39.280 --> 12:40.760
THAT'S WHY
I'M FIRING YOU.

12:40.760 --> 12:43.153
I DON'T LIKE
THE GAMES YOU PLAY

12:43.153 --> 12:46.026
OR THE WAY YOU TEASE
AND MANIPULATE PEOPLE.

12:46.026 --> 12:48.071
AND I HAVE NO INTEREST
IN SPENDING THE NEXT
6 MONTHS

12:48.071 --> 12:50.073
WORKING CLOSELY WITH
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

12:50.073 --> 12:52.119
THAT IS SUCH--
THAT IS SUCH BULL.

12:52.119 --> 12:53.555
THE ONLY REASON
YOU DON'T LIKE ME, DANIEL,

12:53.555 --> 12:55.557
IS BECAUSE I'M MARRIED.

12:55.557 --> 12:57.689
I DON'T KNOW IF
YOU'RE EMBARRASSED
THAT I TURNED YOU DOWN,

12:57.689 --> 13:00.214
OR WHETHER YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMEBODY WHO WILL
SLEEP WITH YOU.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.477
YOU KNOW, I DON'T NEED
TO HEAR THIS FROM YOU.

13:02.477 --> 13:04.653
FINE. THEN I'LL JUST
HAVE TO TAKE IT UP
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

13:04.653 --> 13:06.350
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

13:06.350 --> 13:08.265
IT MEANS--

13:08.265 --> 13:10.702
IT MEANS,
I'M SURE THERE ARE A LOT
OF PEOPLE IN THIS MUSEUM

13:10.702 --> 13:12.922
WHO'D BE VERY INTERESTED
IN HOW IT IS THAT
I GOT FIRED.

13:12.922 --> 13:14.663
ARE YOU--I'M SORRY.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.491
ARE YOU THREATENING ME?

13:16.491 --> 13:18.319
NO, I'M JUST
PROTECTING MYSELF.

13:28.372 --> 13:29.504
OH, NO, PLEASE,

13:29.504 --> 13:31.114
NOT CHRONOLOGICAL
ORDER.

13:31.114 --> 13:33.334
ALWAYS MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE I'VE DIED.

13:33.334 --> 13:35.510
WELL, JOANNE HAD SUGGESTED
GROUPING EVERYTHING
BY CREATIVE INFLUENCE.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.294
WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT?

13:37.294 --> 13:39.122
GREAT, THEN I FEEL
LIKE I'VE DIED

13:39.122 --> 13:40.732
AND COME BACK
AS A CURRICULUM.

13:40.732 --> 13:44.301
WELL, THEN HOW ABOUT
BY MEDIUM?

13:44.301 --> 13:46.913
HE WASN'T SPEAKING
TO YOU, JULIA.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.133
SORRY.

13:50.133 --> 13:53.180
YOU KNOW, THEY USED
A LOT OF MULTI-MEDIA
IN THE BURROUGHS EXHIBIT.

13:53.180 --> 13:55.095
THAT MIGHT BE
A WAY TO GO HERE.

13:55.095 --> 13:57.271
YEAH, YEAH.
BUT NO TALKING HEADS.

13:57.271 --> 14:00.840
THEY ALWAYS TRY TO CRAM YOU
INTO SOME KIND OF ISM.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.189
I HATE ISMS.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.584
WOULD YOU LIKE
TO HELP, JULIA?

14:06.584 --> 14:08.369
PLEASE.

14:08.369 --> 14:11.154
I NEED SOMETHING PICKED UP,
AND IT HAS TO BE BY 6:00.

14:11.154 --> 14:12.155
OK.

14:12.155 --> 14:14.027
LEVINSON DRY CLEANERS.

14:14.027 --> 14:16.594
OUT THE DOOR
AND EAST 6 BLOCKS,

14:16.594 --> 14:18.292
CORNER OF FOURTH
AND BALBOA.

14:18.292 --> 14:20.337
OH, AND CHECK THE COLLAR
FOR A MUSTARD STAIN.

14:20.337 --> 14:22.165
I'VE SENT IT BACK
TWICE ALREADY.

14:22.165 --> 14:23.645
OK?

14:34.525 --> 14:36.005
DO YOU SEE THIS?

14:38.007 --> 14:40.618
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

14:40.618 --> 14:43.795
A FEATHER?

14:43.795 --> 14:48.583
I FOUND IT IN
THURBER'S MOUTH.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.811
OK.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.249
LISTEN, OWEN.

15:04.164 --> 15:05.556
THAT BIRD,

15:05.556 --> 15:09.604
MAYBE IT WASN'T
MEANT TO LIVE.

15:09.604 --> 15:12.215
I MEAN,
YOU MEET A BIRD.

15:12.215 --> 15:14.043
YOU GET TO KNOW IT.

15:14.043 --> 15:16.045
YOU THINK MAYBE
THE BIRD NEEDS YOU.

15:16.045 --> 15:20.571
YOU TAKE IT HOME AND
IT DOESN'T WORK OUT.

15:20.571 --> 15:23.487
THIS IS THE WORST LECTURE
ON LOSS I'VE EVER HEARD.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.837
BUT THAT IS WHY,
OWEN,

15:25.837 --> 15:28.188
THAT YOU NEED
TO TAKE TIME

15:28.188 --> 15:30.407
WHEN YOU MEET NEW,
UM, FRIENDS.

15:30.407 --> 15:32.627
YOU GO SLOW JUST
FOR THIS REASON.

15:32.627 --> 15:35.804
TO SAVE YOURSELF
NEEDLESS SUFFERING.

15:35.804 --> 15:37.414
AND THE OTHER THING
WE'VE LEARNED HERE,
OWE,

15:37.414 --> 15:39.025
IS THAT YOUR
BIG BROTHER,

15:39.025 --> 15:40.896
HE IS ALWAYS RIGHT.

15:40.896 --> 15:43.551
OK?

15:43.551 --> 15:45.205
YOU FEEL BETTER NOW?

15:45.205 --> 15:46.206
YEAH.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.209
I GOT TO GO.

15:54.736 --> 15:58.000
CHARLIE!
CHARLIE!

15:58.000 --> 16:01.003
SO, UM, I PROOFED
ALL THE LABEL TEXT

16:01.003 --> 16:03.049
AND THE CATALOGUE
STUFF TWICE.

16:03.049 --> 16:05.225
OH, AND I FINALLY GOT
AHOLD OF THE M.O.M.A.,

16:05.225 --> 16:08.184
AND THEY SAID THEY HAVE
THOSE 8 LITHOGRAPHS ON
ROTATION.

16:08.184 --> 16:10.186
THANKS.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.710
SO THAT LEAVES
THE PROMO COPY

16:12.710 --> 16:14.277
AND THE BROCHURE STUFF.

16:14.277 --> 16:16.018
AND I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WERE PLANNING--

16:16.018 --> 16:17.411
JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

16:17.411 --> 16:19.021
I'LL GO OVER IT LATER.

16:19.021 --> 16:20.631
BUT THE DEADLINE'S
ON FRIDAY.

16:20.631 --> 16:21.937
GO HOME.

16:21.937 --> 16:25.027
I DON'T NEED YOU HERE.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.029
DANIEL, I DON'T MIND
DOING THE--

16:27.029 --> 16:28.204
IT'S AFTER HOURS, JULIA.

16:28.204 --> 16:31.207
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE AROUND.

16:31.207 --> 16:34.080
I'M SORRY,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.646
PEOPLE LEAVE,
THEY SEE US HERE ALONE.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.170
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO SAY,

16:37.170 --> 16:38.780
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING TO DO

16:38.780 --> 16:40.390
THE NEXT TIME YOU DECIDE
I'M NOT BEING FAIR TO YOU.

16:40.390 --> 16:42.871
BECAUSE YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
THE TYPE OF PERSON

16:42.871 --> 16:45.178
WHO WILL TAKE WHATEVER
ADVANTAGE YOU CAN.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.356
I DON'T TRUST
YOU, JULIA.

16:49.356 --> 16:50.313
SO I WANT YOU
TO GO HOME.

16:59.975 --> 17:00.976
HEY.

17:00.976 --> 17:01.977
HI.

17:03.848 --> 17:06.025
SO, THE, UM...

17:06.025 --> 17:08.244
THE BIRD LIVED.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.681
HE, UH--
HE RECOVERED COMPLETELY.

17:10.681 --> 17:13.641
HE, LIKE, RECOVERED
ALL OVER THE KITCHEN.

17:13.641 --> 17:16.296
BEEN THERE.

17:16.296 --> 17:18.689
HOW COME IT'S ALWAYS GOT
TO BE LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

17:18.689 --> 17:20.039
GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS.

17:20.039 --> 17:21.910
GOOD NEWS, BAD NEWS.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.259
BIRD LIVES, KITCHEN RUINED.

17:23.259 --> 17:24.826
MEET GREAT PERSON,

17:24.826 --> 17:27.263
SHE LEAVES COUNTRY.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.918
THEY, UH, DIDN'T
PICK US, CHARLIE.

17:29.918 --> 17:32.312
THEY'RE TAKING
ANOTHER TEAM
TO CHINA.

17:32.312 --> 17:34.009
OH.

17:35.924 --> 17:39.362
SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE
STICKING AROUND, I GUESS.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.756
TRY NOT TO LOOK
SO HAPPY ABOUT IT.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.888
I'M SORRY.

17:43.888 --> 17:45.194
THAT'S BAD.

17:45.194 --> 17:47.240
I DON'T MEAN TO.

17:47.240 --> 17:52.071
I MEAN, I KNOW THAT
YOU WANTED THAT TRIP A LOT,

17:52.071 --> 17:55.422
AND IT SUCKS
YOU DON'T GET TO GO.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.206
I'M JUST--

17:57.206 --> 17:59.774
I'M JUST--I'M REALLY HAPPY
YOU'RE STAYING.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.297
BUT I'M--I'M SORRY.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.082
I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY YOU CAN'T.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.213
IT'S OK.

18:04.213 --> 18:06.476
I'M HAPPY, TOO.

18:06.476 --> 18:09.479
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.

18:09.479 --> 18:11.742
NO, IT'S TRUE.

18:11.742 --> 18:14.093
I'M HAPPY
YOU'RE HAPPY.

18:14.093 --> 18:17.139
GOD, I'M SUCH
A STUPID PERSON.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.750
OH, CHARLIE,
I SAID IT'S OK.

18:19.750 --> 18:21.100
NO, NO, NOT THAT.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.319
IT'S JUST...

18:23.319 --> 18:24.929
MY WHOLE STUPID THING.

18:24.929 --> 18:27.323
THE WAY I WAIT AND WAIT

18:27.323 --> 18:29.325
FOR SOMETHING BAD TO HAPPEN.

18:29.325 --> 18:30.935
LIKE, WHATEVER IT IS,

18:30.935 --> 18:32.763
IT'S GOT TO GO WRONG.

18:32.763 --> 18:35.114
BUT, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IT DOESN'T.

18:35.114 --> 18:36.941
MAYBE...

18:36.941 --> 18:39.379
MAYBE LIFE CAN BE GOOD.

18:57.484 --> 19:00.313
HEY, WOW,
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

19:00.313 --> 19:05.056
I ACTUALLY GET
TO SEE MY WIFE
BEFORE MIDNIGHT.

19:05.056 --> 19:07.015
ARE YOU OK?
SOMETHING WRONG?

19:07.015 --> 19:09.365
NO, I'M FINE.

19:09.365 --> 19:11.411
HAVE YOU BEEN CRYING?

19:11.411 --> 19:14.022
I'M--I'M JUST TIRED.

19:14.022 --> 19:16.633
I'M GOING TO GO TO BED.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.244
JULIA?

19:18.244 --> 19:21.595
I--I JUST NEED
SOME SLEEP, OK?

19:34.738 --> 19:37.698
...CHECKING MY WATCH
ON PURPOSE, LIKE,
REALLY HUGE.

19:37.698 --> 19:39.743
HOPING THIS MAN
WOULD TAKE THE HINT.

19:39.743 --> 19:42.050
HE'S LIKE,
"YEAH, I'LL SHARE
MY DRINKING STORY,

19:42.050 --> 19:45.184
BUT I AIN'T GOING
TO SHARE THIS MIKE."

19:45.184 --> 19:47.055
OHH.

19:47.055 --> 19:49.013
WELL, THIS IS YOUR FLOOR.

19:49.013 --> 19:51.015
YOU GET OFF HERE.

29:44.434 --> 29:45.827
I--I'M SORRY.

29:45.827 --> 29:48.003
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO CALL YOU BACK.

29:48.003 --> 29:50.049
I'M SORRY.
TO ME? ABOUT...

29:50.049 --> 29:53.313
JULIA. SHE HASN'T
EXACTLY BEEN HAPPY
ABOUT WORK LATELY.

29:53.313 --> 29:55.315
LAST NIGHT
SHE CAME HOME CRYING.

29:55.315 --> 29:57.143
WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TALK TO HER ABOUT THIS.

29:57.143 --> 29:58.666
I'VE TRIED THAT.

29:58.666 --> 30:00.929
HEH. LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE TOLD YOU,

30:00.929 --> 30:02.452
BUT, UH, I THINK
YOU OUGHT TO KNOW--

30:02.452 --> 30:04.193
I THINK THAT YOU OUGHT
TO TELL YOUR WIFE

30:04.193 --> 30:05.238
TO WEAR
HER WEDDING RING.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.848
WEAR HER WHAT?

30:06.848 --> 30:08.807
BECAUSE
IF SHE GOES AROUND
WITHOUT THE RING,

30:08.807 --> 30:10.460
ACTING LIKE SHE'S
AVAILABLE, SENDING
OUT THESE SIGNALS.

30:10.460 --> 30:11.766

TALKING ABOUT?

30:11.766 --> 30:13.115
YOU KNOW,
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

30:13.115 --> 30:14.247

WHAT ARE YOU
DEFENDING HIM FOR?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.514
BEC...

30:24.126 --> 30:26.302

NOT ALL HIS FAULT.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.917
GRIFFIN, STOP!
WILL YOU LISTEN TO ME?!

30:31.917 --> 30:33.527
IT WAS NOTHING.
NOTHING HAPPENED.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.268
NOTHING, HUH?

30:35.268 --> 30:37.923
IS THAT WHY YOU SAID
IT WASN'T HIS FAULT, HUH?

30:37.923 --> 30:39.881
WHAT WASN'T HIS FAULT?

30:39.881 --> 30:41.970
NOTHING?

30:41.970 --> 30:44.146
HE SAID THAT
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN WEARING
YOUR WEDDING RING,

30:44.146 --> 30:46.148
AND THAT YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE ACTED SO AVAILABLE.

30:46.148 --> 30:48.150
WHAT IS THAT? WHAT,
DID YOU COME ON TO HIM

30:48.150 --> 30:49.543
AND THEN GET UPSET
WHEN HE TURNED YOU DOWN?

30:49.543 --> 30:50.979
I TURNED HIM DOWN,
GRIFFIN.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.328
HE CAME ON TO ME,
AND I TURNED HIM DOWN.

30:52.328 --> 30:54.156
THEN WHY WERE YOU
DEFENDING HIM IN THERE?

30:54.156 --> 30:56.593
BECAUSE I LET HIM
THINK I WAS INTERESTED.

30:56.593 --> 31:00.249
WHAT?I WANTED THE JOB, GRIFFIN.

31:00.249 --> 31:03.078
I REALLY WANTED THE JOB,
AND I COULD TELL
THAT HE LIKED ME,

31:03.078 --> 31:05.080
SO I WAITED TO TELL HIM
I WAS MARRIED.

31:05.080 --> 31:07.648
I DIDN'T LIE.
I JUST LET HIM THINK
WHAT HE WANTED.

31:07.648 --> 31:08.736
WHY?

31:08.736 --> 31:10.346
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

31:10.346 --> 31:12.566
I THOUGHT...

31:12.566 --> 31:16.309
I THOUGHT IF I
WASN'T DOING ANYTHING
THAT IT WAS OK.

31:16.309 --> 31:19.094
I JUST DID
WHATEVER IT TOOK
TO GET THE JOB.

31:19.094 --> 31:21.053
IT WAS STUPID, GRIFFIN,
IT WAS REALLY STUPID,

31:21.053 --> 31:22.358
BUT THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

FOR ME AND MY GIRL.

31:56.349 --> 31:58.307

READ ALL ABOUT IT, BAILEY.

31:59.526 --> 32:00.744
IT SAYS "NOVEMBER 1."

32:00.744 --> 32:02.616
I DON'T CARE
WHAT IT SAYS.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.618
I THINK I FIGURED
SOMETHING OUT.

32:04.618 --> 32:06.794
NO, I OWE HIM
$2,100.

32:06.794 --> 32:08.578
NOT NECESSARILY.

32:08.578 --> 32:10.537
HOW MANY MONTHS DID
YOU HAVE TO COMPLAIN

32:10.537 --> 32:12.017
TO GET THAT
FUNKY WIRING FIXED?

32:12.017 --> 32:14.106
I--I DON'T KNOW.

32:14.106 --> 32:17.065
I MEAN, I--I GUESS
I'VE BEEN REPLACING
FUSES SINCE JULY.

32:17.065 --> 32:20.677
THAT'S A VIOLATION
OF YOUR LEASE AGREEMENT.
HE BROKE YOUR LEASE.

32:20.677 --> 32:23.202
HE DID?ABSOLUTELY.

32:23.202 --> 32:26.031

BEEN GOING ON?

A COUPLE OF MONTHS,
I GUESS.

32:29.991 --> 32:32.254
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO IS
YOU'RE GONNA WRITE A LETTER
TO THE RENT-CONTROL BOARD,

32:32.254 --> 32:34.604
AND YOU'RE GONNA
LIST EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM
YOU'VE HAD IN THIS PLACE

32:34.604 --> 32:37.172

IT TOOK HIM TO FIX IT.

32:37.172 --> 32:39.435

GONNA TICK HIM OFF MORE?

32:39.435 --> 32:41.481

STOP THIS THING DEAD.

32:41.481 --> 32:44.571
IT'S GONNA TIE UP
THE WHOLE EVICTION PROCESS.

TIME TO PAY HIM OFF,

39:37.070 --> 39:39.986
IT'S LIKE YOU'RE
NOT INTO ANY OF THIS.

39:39.986 --> 39:42.118
YOU'RE NOT INTO
BEING MARRIED AT ALL.

39:42.118 --> 39:44.164
GRIFFIN, THIS...

39:44.164 --> 39:47.123
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH BEING MARRIED TO YOU.

39:47.123 --> 39:49.952
IT'S NOT ABOUT US.

39:49.952 --> 39:51.258
IT'S NOT.

39:51.258 --> 39:53.173
THEN WHAT'S
IT ABOUT, HUH?

39:53.173 --> 39:55.784
CAN YOU TELL ME THAT?

39:58.439 --> 39:59.397
IT'S JUST...

40:01.573 --> 40:03.009
I DON'T KNOW.

40:03.009 --> 40:06.534
I MEAN, I--I GET
TO WORK AND IT'S THIS...

40:06.534 --> 40:09.058
AMAZING JOB, YOU KNOW,

40:09.058 --> 40:11.365
AND I'M EXCITED...

40:11.365 --> 40:13.411
BUT ALSO, I'M SCARED,

40:13.411 --> 40:16.109
BECAUSE EVERYONE'S
WEARING LIPSTICK
AND HEELS,

40:16.109 --> 40:18.633
AND THEY'RE ALL
LIKE THESE ADULTS.

40:18.633 --> 40:19.939
YOU KNOW?

40:21.375 --> 40:23.377
BUT THEN I THINK
TO MYSELF,

40:23.377 --> 40:24.944
"THEY'RE NO DIFFERENT
FROM ME,"

40:24.944 --> 40:28.251
SO I PUT ON MY LIPSTICK,
AND I ACT LIKE THEY ACT,

40:28.251 --> 40:29.905
AND IT ALL SEEMS OK.

40:35.171 --> 40:38.044
BUT IT WASN'T OK, GRIFFIN.

40:41.743 --> 40:45.138
THERE'S A LOT I DON'T KNOW.

40:45.138 --> 40:48.097
THERE'S A LOT
I'VE NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT.

40:50.970 --> 40:53.320
THERE'S A REASON...

40:53.320 --> 40:56.802
I FELT LIKE JUST
A KID PLAYING DRESS-UP.

41:04.418 --> 41:06.289
WELL, THAT'S IT.

41:08.291 --> 41:11.381
SURE YOU DON'T
WANT ANOTHER CLOUD
UP OVER THERE?

41:11.381 --> 41:14.907
NO, I THINK IT
MIGHT START TO LOOK
A LITTLE OVERCAST.

41:14.907 --> 41:16.343
YEAH.

41:16.343 --> 41:18.824
MIGHT AS WELL
GIVE HER NICE WEATHER.

41:21.696 --> 41:22.958
SO...

41:24.917 --> 41:26.048
SO...

41:27.136 --> 41:28.964
YOU GOT SOME...

41:28.964 --> 41:30.009
ON YOUR...

41:30.009 --> 41:31.010
I DID?

41:31.010 --> 41:32.011
YEAH.

41:32.011 --> 41:33.055
IT'S--

41:33.055 --> 41:34.970
NO, OVER MORE.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.624
NOT THAT MUCH.

41:36.624 --> 41:39.061
BAILEY, YOU DO IT.

41:39.061 --> 41:40.541
IT'S RIGHT HERE.

41:40.541 --> 41:42.761
SORRY. IT'S KIND OF
DRIED ALREADY.

42:11.833 --> 42:13.748
HELLO. EVERYONE, WELCOME.

42:13.748 --> 42:15.707
UH, WELCOME
TO THE WORTHINGTON MUSEUM.

42:15.707 --> 42:17.578
I'M...

42:23.453 --> 42:26.021
I'M, UH...

42:26.021 --> 42:28.415
JULIA HOLBROOK.

42:34.116 --> 42:36.989
AND WELCOME
TO THE WORTHINGTON MUSEUM.

42:36.989 --> 42:39.252
I'M SORRY.
I JUST SAID THAT.

42:39.252 --> 42:41.254
I'LL BE
YOUR TOUR GUIDE TODAY.

42:41.254 --> 42:43.082
SO IF YOU'LL
FOLLOW ME, PLEASE...

42:53.875 --> 42:55.268
OK, PUT YOUR HANDS
AROUND MINE.

42:55.268 --> 42:56.486
THAT'S GOOD.

42:56.486 --> 42:58.314
OK, NOW,
WHEN I COUNT TO 3,

42:58.314 --> 42:59.664
WE'RE GONNA
TOSS HIM UP AND
LET HIM GO.

42:59.664 --> 43:00.665
THINK YOU CAN
DO THAT?

43:00.665 --> 43:01.666
YEAH.

43:01.666 --> 43:03.406
OK. READY?

43:03.406 --> 43:06.235
1,

43:06.235 --> 43:07.410
2,

43:07.410 --> 43:08.411
3.

43:08.411 --> 43:10.370
GO.
