00:01.180 --> 00:06.540
- That's all we need, what does DSC
stand for? - Trouble. - Who's Dale Sken?

00:06.575 --> 00:09.340
Sken, sir, is slang for a gun.

00:10.040 --> 00:11.105
Check out the hot chick.

00:11.140 --> 00:13.945
- I've got a Saturday job at Berni's.
- The beauty salon?

00:13.980 --> 00:19.185
- Yeah. What do you think of my new look?
- If anyone could turn me, it's you!

00:19.220 --> 00:23.780
- Afternoon. - Hey. - Michael! 
- Daniel phoned, I gather we have a 
potential gang problem.

00:23.815 --> 00:26.900
ROWDY SHOUTING

00:28.900 --> 00:32.505
I'd rather go home... with you.

00:32.540 --> 00:36.580
- I'll never forgive you for this, I despise you!
- Oi!

00:36.615 --> 00:38.940
It's not over, this.

00:40.000 --> 00:46.074

01:22.740 --> 01:27.480
- Vote Trudi Siddiqui for head
girl. - Vote Diamond! - Vote Madi!

01:27.515 --> 01:31.587
Vote Trudi. I've got some really
good policies, honestly. Vote Trudi.

01:31.622 --> 01:35.660
I don't know if I've got the energy
for teaching after last night.

01:35.695 --> 01:39.677
I didn't hear you complaining
at the time. There she is.

01:39.712 --> 01:43.660
- How's the campaign trail?
- Do you want something?

01:43.695 --> 01:47.065
- WOW!
- SHE LAUGHS

01:47.100 --> 01:51.940
- Thank you, they're lush!
- They were Sian's idea.

01:51.975 --> 01:54.420
Perks of being a science
teacher... Helium.

01:55.980 --> 02:01.980
- Right, see you in a bit, Dad.
- OK, good luck.

02:03.540 --> 02:07.300
What more do I have to do?
I've said sorry enough times.

02:07.335 --> 02:09.220
She'll come round.

02:14.580 --> 02:18.660
- Oh, I'm all right with this, ta.
- Why the rabbit food?

02:18.695 --> 02:20.540
Just not hungry.

02:22.140 --> 02:24.505
Ah, Lauren. Just the lass.

02:24.540 --> 02:27.625
New Candora catalogue,
hot off the press!

02:27.660 --> 02:31.520
I'm OK, thanks, I get all my stuff
from work you know, staff discount.

02:31.555 --> 02:35.380
That's what I was thinking, if I
give you a few testers, take them in

02:35.415 --> 02:38.700
on Saturday and I'll give you
a cut of anything they order.

02:38.735 --> 02:40.985
We only use top of the
range stuff at the salon.

02:41.020 --> 02:46.180
- Excuse me, Candora is top of the range!
- Trust me, it's not.

02:48.940 --> 02:54.980
- SHE LAUGHS - Suddenly taken an
interest?! - Puh - these prices?

02:55.015 --> 02:58.220
Well, you'll not get them
cheaper anywhere else!

03:08.860 --> 03:14.265
- Vote Madi! - Is it all gimmicks or
do you have any policies? - Of course!

03:14.300 --> 03:18.545
Head girl's in charge of entertainment
budget and who throws the best party here?

03:18.580 --> 03:23.660
- I think they'll be looking for something more substantial than that.
- Well, it's up to them.

03:23.695 --> 03:27.497
And if they vote for me they're
GUARANTEED to have a good time. Balloon?

03:27.532 --> 03:31.300
- How's it going?
- I'm going to wipe the floor with her in the hustings.

03:31.335 --> 03:35.820
Course you are, you've got brains
AND beauty. A winning combination.

03:37.060 --> 03:41.505
Yow, what are you doing back here?
You're lucky I didn't press charges.

03:41.540 --> 03:46.420
- And we all know why that is, don't we? - Let
him go, Finn. - See? Blood is thicker than water.

03:46.455 --> 03:49.500
Don't think you're
forgiven, because you're not.

03:58.782 --> 04:01.700
No, honestly, you'd have
done the same yourselves.

04:01.735 --> 04:04.297
Well, now's our chance
to prove you right.

04:04.332 --> 04:06.825
Let's nip this gang culture in the bud.

04:06.860 --> 04:09.380
The police have put more
patrols on the estates,

04:09.415 --> 04:11.757
but this school is our responsibility.

04:11.792 --> 04:14.065
So let's all be extra vigilant, please.

04:14.100 --> 04:18.339
If any of you have any concerns, however
minor you think they are, bring them to me.

04:18.375 --> 04:20.865
What about Tariq? I
saw him coming in today.

04:20.899 --> 04:23.940
- We're not having him back, are we?
- I think we should give him a chance.

04:23.975 --> 04:28.060
Just leave Tariq to me, please.
We have over 600 other pupils

04:28.095 --> 04:30.705
in danger of gravitating
toward the gangs.

04:30.740 --> 04:35.305
- Don't we want them to be decent, responsible members of society instead?
- Yeah, of course.

04:35.340 --> 04:41.020
Well, that's got everything to do with how they
present themselves, speak and behave. Basic etiquette.

04:41.055 --> 04:45.820
So let's get these kids speaking properly
for starters. Street slang's for the streets.

04:45.855 --> 04:49.465
If it's not in the
Oxford English Dictionary,

04:49.500 --> 04:52.780
it has no place in this school.
Now this is a list of ten

04:52.815 --> 04:56.060
common examples of street
slang banned from now on.

04:59.100 --> 05:02.825
- Blud. - Brap?! - Sick! -
And they call me a pedant.

05:02.860 --> 05:07.140
I'm happy to take that crown from you,
Grantly, because this initiative will work.

05:07.175 --> 05:11.265
- Let's stamp out gang culture in all its forms.
- Makes sense to me.

05:11.300 --> 05:15.500
Good. If you have any other ideas on tackling
the problem I'd like to hear them. Thank you.

05:15.535 --> 05:18.425
And can I just remind
everyone it's head boy

05:18.460 --> 05:21.980
and head girl elections today, so
please encourage everyone to vote.

05:22.015 --> 05:24.220
Yes, for Madi!

05:30.940 --> 05:33.980
Er, what?! You? Cosmetics?

05:34.015 --> 05:36.985
Come and see me at lunchtime.

05:37.020 --> 05:40.025
I'll get you something for
those bags under your eyes.

05:40.060 --> 05:44.100
- You do look like you've been burning the candle at both ends.
- Oh, I wish!

05:44.135 --> 05:47.345
Rosie's moved in. She's got me
waiting on her hand and foot.

05:47.380 --> 05:51.860
- Last night she demanded a fried egg and marmite sandwich.
- Wow.

05:51.895 --> 05:56.340
- At midnight!
- Oh, God! She's still got a while to go, hasn't she?

05:56.375 --> 05:59.860
Another seven weeks. I can't
imagine getting any more sleep

05:59.895 --> 06:03.865
when the screaming bundle
of joy arrives either.

06:03.900 --> 06:07.940
- Cheer up, it'll all be worth it in the end, mate.
- Good luck.

06:07.975 --> 06:10.620
HE SIGHS

06:11.700 --> 06:16.780
- You should give Tariq a second chance.
- He's had a second chance. And third, fourth, fifth and sixth.

06:16.815 --> 06:19.217
If we expel him, what
are his choices, eh?

06:19.252 --> 06:21.585
To become a fully
fledged member of the DSC?

06:21.620 --> 06:25.820
- Well that will be HIS decision, not ours.
- At least here, he's got a support system.

06:25.855 --> 06:29.145
We could monitor the gang pressure.

06:29.180 --> 06:33.985
- We should be helping him.
- You've really given this some thought.

06:34.020 --> 06:39.380
- Yeah, I've had a lot of time on my hands since Linda...
- Well, it's time much better spent.

06:41.460 --> 06:43.865
Some schools have gang liaison officers.

06:43.900 --> 06:46.420
We just don't have the
staff budget for that.

06:46.455 --> 06:48.905
What if there was a
teacher who's already here?

06:48.940 --> 06:51.460
- Someone the kids trusted.
- Are you volunteering?

06:51.495 --> 06:54.585
Look, I'll keep across
your literacy drive.

06:54.620 --> 06:58.500
I can organise regular visits with
the police and community leaders.

06:58.535 --> 07:00.905
Please, Mr Byrne.

07:00.940 --> 07:05.065
If you don't want to give Tariq a chance, give
it to me. I think I can get through to him.

07:05.100 --> 07:10.380
All right, you're appointed. But Tariq reports
to you morning, break, lunchtime and after school.

07:10.415 --> 07:12.900
- Roger that.
- And thanks, Daniel.

07:25.220 --> 07:30.505
Come on, keep your chin
up, it's not all bad.

07:30.540 --> 07:34.180
- He wants to exclude me, doesn't he?
- He does, yeah.

07:37.020 --> 07:41.105
- I've managed to talk him out of it.
- Really?

07:41.140 --> 07:44.185
Mason's not coming back.
Treat this as a fresh start.

07:44.220 --> 07:48.220
- I never wanted to get involved with him in the first place.
- You have to prove that to everyone.

07:48.255 --> 07:51.425
Show them you're a responsible,
reliable individual.

07:51.460 --> 07:54.980
They've already made me prefect.
That didn't exactly work out.

07:55.015 --> 07:57.745
- How about running for head boy?
- Me?

07:57.780 --> 08:01.140
What better way to show you're
serious than standing at hustings.

08:01.175 --> 08:04.345
- Tell them what you're about.
- They won't vote for me.

08:04.380 --> 08:09.980
Not the Tariq that was swaggering around the place.
But what about the one who protects his sisters?

08:10.015 --> 08:12.665
The family man? Show
them your caring side.

08:12.700 --> 08:16.945
- I don't know how to.
- Well, you listen to what they want.

08:16.980 --> 08:21.020
You'll come up with solutions to their
problems if you put your mind to it.

08:33.419 --> 08:37.140
- It'll wash off. - It better
had. - It's only a bit of ink.

08:37.174 --> 08:39.860
You never used to mind
getting your hands dirty.

08:42.460 --> 08:46.185
'My ambition is to study
hotel management at Uni'.

08:46.220 --> 08:49.300
- At least I know what I want to do.
- So do I! PE teacher.

08:49.335 --> 08:51.785
Something the electorate can relate to.

08:51.820 --> 08:54.860
Hardly imaginative, is it?
Following Daddy's footsteps.

08:54.895 --> 08:57.385
Well, it's better than
being a beauty therapist.

08:57.420 --> 09:02.580
I mean really, who wants to spend the rest of
their life scraping corns off old biddy's feet?

09:02.615 --> 09:05.145
- Well actually, I'm going to be a model.
- Yeah, right.

09:05.180 --> 09:10.020
- Well for your information, I've been spotted by an agent.
- Dream on.

09:10.055 --> 09:13.465
Straight up, look. She
came into the salon.

09:13.500 --> 09:17.300
- They've got auditions today.
- And you've got one? - Yeah.

09:17.335 --> 09:20.025
They said I'm just what
they were looking for.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.380
Well, it's only an audition, and
you're hardly Kate Moss, are you?

09:34.740 --> 09:38.540
- Watch it, bro. - Soz, man.
- Oi, you two, stop that.

09:38.575 --> 09:41.677
Gang shakes are banned,
remember? Our new code of conduct?

09:41.712 --> 09:44.780
- Sorry, I forgot.
- I only told you ten minutes ago.

09:44.815 --> 09:47.465
Well, it's our new
thing now. 'Spect innit.

09:47.500 --> 09:50.740
- And talking like this isn't acceptable. Cooler, now!
- What?

09:50.775 --> 09:55.380
Now, Denzil! And who told
you lot to stop, eh? Oi!

10:02.260 --> 10:04.345
- Nerves?
- What?

10:04.380 --> 10:09.145
- The audition?
- I wasn't spotted at all. It's an open audition.

10:09.180 --> 10:14.220
- I just said that to shut Madi up.
- So? Still go for it. You're pretty.

10:14.255 --> 10:18.460
- And you're gay.
- Doesn't mean I don't know a good looking girl!

10:18.495 --> 10:20.585
I'm hardly model material, am I?

10:20.620 --> 10:23.740
- You'll never know unless you go for it.
- Morning, everyone.

10:23.775 --> 10:27.545
Take out your notes on
exothermic reactions, please,

10:27.580 --> 10:31.140
we're doing a contrasting experiment
today. And while you're doing that,

10:31.175 --> 10:34.700
I will be handing out a list of
words that are now banned in school.

10:34.735 --> 10:38.625
- Is 'coursework' on there?
- Nice try. But no.

10:38.660 --> 10:41.840
This is all part of Mr Byrne's
new initiative to turn out

10:41.875 --> 10:44.985
- civilised beings.
- What's she banging on about now?

10:45.020 --> 10:48.420
- And thank you, Kyle, for being the
first to transgress. - Uh? - Ah-ha!

10:48.455 --> 10:52.185
- Shut it, Sharkey.
- Kyle! I don't want to give you detention.

10:52.220 --> 10:57.260
- Dunno what I did wrong, Miss? - You mean you
'don't know' what you did wrong? - OK, seriously.

10:57.295 --> 11:00.025
POSH ACCENT: I don't
know... that any better?

11:00.060 --> 11:04.700
- LAUGHTER
- 'Banging' in the context you intended is a slang use of the word.

11:04.735 --> 11:08.065
Yeah. You mean for this? LAUGHTER

11:08.100 --> 11:12.260
Thank you, Mr Stack. Cooler
- you had your chance.

11:16.900 --> 11:20.585
Miss, this is pathetic.
It's the way people talk.

11:20.620 --> 11:24.140
We're trying to change that to
the way people SHOULD be talking.

11:24.175 --> 11:26.345
It's all about communication.

11:26.380 --> 11:29.905
Something we could all
improve on, myself included.

11:29.940 --> 11:33.300
- It's infringing our civil liberties.
- This is for your own good.

11:33.335 --> 11:35.505
If you can't behave or speak properly,

11:35.540 --> 11:38.420
then you'll waste all the
opportunities life has to give you.

11:38.455 --> 11:41.300
I don't think this place presents
us with a lot of opportunities.

11:41.335 --> 11:44.140
Well, then, even more reason
to take pride in yourselves

11:44.175 --> 11:47.260
and make the most of those you have got.

12:00.260 --> 12:03.500
LAUGHING AND SHOUTING

12:06.860 --> 12:11.620
Haven't been in this place for
ages. Dad's going to kill me.

12:11.655 --> 12:15.980
That's enough, that's enough!
Pass these round, please.

12:17.900 --> 12:21.745
Well, we all know why you're here.

12:21.780 --> 12:25.500
We want to protect the
school from gangs...

12:25.535 --> 12:27.545
Sir, you know nothing on gangs.

12:27.580 --> 12:32.100
- I know those red shoe laces symbolise the Dale Sken Crew.
- And?

12:32.135 --> 12:34.985
The DSC threatened Finn Sharkey
with a knife, three of them

12:35.020 --> 12:39.380
were convicted of armed robbery last year
and another two for a series of muggings.

12:39.415 --> 12:43.705
We want to save you from a
life of mindless criminality.

12:43.740 --> 12:47.740
So, I want you to think about what
the future holds for you and how

12:47.775 --> 12:51.740
our new initiative on literacy and
decent behaviour's going to help.

12:51.775 --> 12:54.465
- Now, Kyle...
- You know what, Mr Chalk,

12:54.500 --> 12:57.980
you might be right. I don't
need to advertise who I am.

12:58.015 --> 13:00.220
Right... so, great. Thank you.

13:02.140 --> 13:04.625
Very impressive, Daniel.

13:04.660 --> 13:08.185
I think we might even
have reached Kyle Stack.

13:08.220 --> 13:12.700
- Was this your idea too? - Yeah. - You sure this
sends out the right message to the other pupils?

13:12.735 --> 13:15.705
- He's just come back from exclusion.
- I just wanted to give him

13:15.740 --> 13:20.380
- the opportunity to prove himself to them. Show them he's changed.
- IF he's changed.

13:32.260 --> 13:35.260
- That's a joke, right?
- No, Mr Chalk wants him to run.

13:35.295 --> 13:38.980
Reckons he can set an example to others.

14:14.060 --> 14:16.980
Hi. I'm here for the
auditions, it's Lauren Andrews.

14:22.820 --> 14:26.820
I did call? Talitha gave me her card.

14:42.020 --> 14:44.580
And I'll give you at
least four discos a term

14:44.615 --> 14:47.745
and a school prom after exams.

14:47.780 --> 14:51.580
So, if you want to party,
you know who to vote for.

14:51.615 --> 14:54.117
Madi Diamond
- head girl.

14:54.152 --> 14:56.620
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

15:01.700 --> 15:04.520
First time I've done anything like this.

15:04.555 --> 15:07.340
Dead nervous. Have you got any tips?

15:12.900 --> 15:15.260
SHE SIGHS

15:21.740 --> 15:25.500
I propose the head girl leads
a forum of representatives

15:25.535 --> 15:28.700
from each year who will
meet weekly with teachers.

15:28.735 --> 15:31.265
Boring! LAUGHTER

15:31.300 --> 15:35.705
It is important that you have
someone campaigning for you.

15:35.740 --> 15:40.020
So, you're all happy with this new
kangaroo court of justice, are you?

15:40.055 --> 15:43.145
Well this new etiquette 'initiative'
that's been slapped on us

15:43.180 --> 15:47.100
with no warning. It's a blatant
attack on our freedom of expression.

15:47.135 --> 15:49.305
Don't YOU want a say
in the new school rules?

15:49.340 --> 15:52.820
Well, Trudi, head girl has no
say in deciding the school rules.

15:52.855 --> 15:54.625
You're not doing me out of a job.

15:54.660 --> 15:58.340
My proposed forum will also
nominate a school charity

15:58.375 --> 16:00.665
and organise fund-raising events.

16:00.700 --> 16:03.145
- Including a charity ball.
- Oi, that's one of mine!

16:03.180 --> 16:06.260
- Except this is for a good cause.
- What you're saying is,

16:06.295 --> 16:09.420
you'd rather save the whales
than us have a good time?

16:09.455 --> 16:11.580
MOCKING LAUGHTER

16:18.700 --> 16:21.780
OK, that will do, thank you, Alice.

16:21.815 --> 16:25.820
Erm... Lauren Andrews, please.

16:28.540 --> 16:31.940
If you vote for me as head boy,
I'll get you big screen tellies

16:31.975 --> 16:34.477
in the hall, so we can watch the games.

16:34.512 --> 16:36.945
And we can also use
it for film nights too.

16:36.980 --> 16:39.705
Tariq, I don't think this
is persuading anyone here

16:39.740 --> 16:43.185
that you've changed. I think
we'd rather hear you talk about

16:43.220 --> 16:47.260
your opinions on some of the key
issues. Knife crime for example.

16:47.295 --> 16:51.300
- I'm against it, obviously. -
You weren't always. - I told you.

16:51.335 --> 16:52.985
I've made some mistakes.

16:53.020 --> 16:57.660
Did you ever stop to consider
what it might be like to

16:57.695 --> 17:02.300
- be on the other end of that blade?
- No. No, I didn't.

17:03.700 --> 17:06.780
I regret what I've done and I promise,

17:06.815 --> 17:08.859
I'll never hold a knife again.

17:08.895 --> 17:13.060
APPLAUSE

17:16.060 --> 17:18.944
Sorry. I've not done this
before. What do I need to do?

17:18.980 --> 17:22.540
- You've seen clothes catalogues, haven't you?
- Yeah, of course.

17:22.575 --> 17:26.099
Well, that's what we want.
Natural, wholesome, girl next door.

17:37.820 --> 17:41.425
OK, now let's try the girl next door,

17:41.460 --> 17:47.380
but without a stick up her backside.
Relax, love! Give me a smile.

17:48.620 --> 17:49.740
Perfect.

18:10.100 --> 18:13.600
- Thank you, Lauren.
- How did I do?

18:13.635 --> 18:17.065
- I'm afraid you're not for us.
- But...

18:17.100 --> 18:21.140
I'm sorry, but you can
see how competitive it is.

18:21.175 --> 18:23.145
OK!

18:23.180 --> 18:26.820
Next, a late nomination. Finn
Sharkey. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

18:26.855 --> 18:28.820
- Did you put him up to this?
- No.

18:33.540 --> 18:37.740
Have any of you ever heard the phrase,
a leopard never changes its spots?

18:37.775 --> 18:40.345
How about crocodile tears?

18:40.380 --> 18:44.500
Thank you, Mr Sharkey, that's enough
with the natural world analogies.

18:44.535 --> 18:47.460
- Let's hear some of your policies.
- That is my policy, Sir.

18:47.495 --> 18:50.865
Keeping this place safe from
the likes of him, the DSC

18:50.900 --> 18:54.540
and any other gang that thinks
it can get through them gates.

18:54.575 --> 18:57.900
This is our school and I'm
going to keep it that way.

18:57.935 --> 19:00.500
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

19:09.300 --> 19:15.180
- You're a pretty girl.
- Yeah, well, not pretty enough obviously.

19:15.215 --> 19:16.905
SHE SIGHS

19:16.940 --> 19:19.625
You're not the right look for us,

19:19.660 --> 19:23.500
but if you're serious
about being a model...

19:23.535 --> 19:26.225
- I am.
- An old colleague.

19:26.260 --> 19:30.700
She's got girls on her list
who do lingerie catalogues,

19:30.735 --> 19:33.345
swimwear, that sort of thing.

19:33.380 --> 19:38.425
Yeah, well, I'd be fine doing
catalogue work, but I've got a

19:38.460 --> 19:43.040
birthmark on my back which means I'm
hardly going to sell a bikini, am I?

19:43.075 --> 19:47.347
- Plus I'm hardly a double E. - So,
fix it. - How?! - Cosmetic surgery.

19:47.382 --> 19:51.620
You wouldn't be the first model to use
it. There's plenty of clinics around.

19:51.655 --> 19:54.697
You reckon I'd get in, that
they'd take me seriously?

19:54.732 --> 19:57.705
Well, I'm no expert, but
I've heard it can be done.

19:57.740 --> 20:02.140
- It's got to be worth a shot, hasn't it?
- Yeah, I guess so.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.985
Thanks, Talitha.

20:06.020 --> 20:09.945
And I'll think about maybe
getting a boob job as well,

20:09.980 --> 20:15.380
make sure I'm really confident, give myself the best possible chance.
- That's your decision, isn't it?

20:15.415 --> 20:17.220
Good luck, Lauren.

20:28.300 --> 20:32.340
- Are you OK?
- Mr Byrne's got it in for me.

20:32.375 --> 20:35.345
What do you expect with your reputation?

20:35.380 --> 20:39.560
- Yeah, well, he can stick his stupid election.
- Shame.

20:39.595 --> 20:43.740
I didn't think you'd give up
that easily. Guess I was wrong.

20:54.220 --> 20:57.745
Nice work, mate. You get my vote.

20:57.780 --> 21:00.860
Mr Chalk said I had to stand
or else I'd get kicked out.

21:00.895 --> 21:04.785
Yeah, and I'm with you.
We've got to play the game.

21:04.820 --> 21:10.240
- Get them where we want.
- Too right, tell them what they want to hear.

21:10.275 --> 21:15.660
- Exactly. So, did you mean all that stuff about the knife?
- Course not.

21:15.695 --> 21:20.180
Good. Because the word from above
is that you've earned your stripes.

21:22.580 --> 21:26.665
- All yours.
- No, ta. You seen what happened to Mason.

21:26.700 --> 21:29.780
- I can't go down again.
- You ain't going soft on us, are you?

21:29.815 --> 21:33.557
- Nah, of course not...
- GABOS.

21:33.592 --> 21:37.300
Game Ain't Based On Sympathy.

21:37.335 --> 21:40.700
You get that?

21:40.735 --> 21:42.860
Go on.

21:45.580 --> 21:48.060
See you later.

21:52.740 --> 21:56.320
Vote Finn! The head boy with
nothing to apologise for!

21:56.355 --> 22:00.407
Come on, kids, you know
it makes sense. Vote Finn.

22:00.442 --> 22:04.711
Here you are, mate,
d'you want one? Vote Finn.

22:04.746 --> 22:08.945
- So what are your policies?
- Give me a chance.

22:08.980 --> 22:13.300
- I've only just decided to run. - To spite
Tariq. - He'll make everyone's lives a misery.

22:13.335 --> 22:15.865
- I know he's your brother, but..
- Finn, it's fine.

22:15.900 --> 22:20.265
I have less of a problem with you
than Mr Byrne, at least you're honest.

22:20.300 --> 22:24.460
- The way he ripped Tariq's presentation apart
wasn't fair. - Tariq got off easy. - What?

22:24.495 --> 22:27.860
Mr Byrne's new rule has had half
the school in the cooler already.

22:27.895 --> 22:28.940
That's not fair.

22:35.620 --> 22:38.420
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

22:38.455 --> 22:41.220
I thank you, thank you.

22:46.260 --> 22:50.665
- Hey, how did it go? - Erm, yeah,
good. - Nice one. I told you, didn't I?

22:50.700 --> 22:55.620
- Just because you have an agent, don't mean you'll get any jobs.
- That's where you're wrong.

22:55.655 --> 22:58.380
- She already lined up a few shoots for me.
- Seriously?

22:58.415 --> 23:01.785
Yeah, just some like,
catalogue clothing stuff.

23:01.820 --> 23:04.660
- Then we must celebrate.
- Worth knowing now, am I?

23:04.695 --> 23:07.860
Lozza, you are my ticket
to some wicked parties.

23:07.895 --> 23:09.700
Goodbye, Rochdale. Hello, Milan.

23:09.735 --> 23:11.540
SHE SCOFFS

23:20.020 --> 23:23.820
Hi, erm, I heard that
you do free consultations?

23:24.940 --> 23:28.740
It's for laser treatment
and maybe breast enlargement.

23:30.580 --> 23:32.900
OK, when can I come in and discuss it?

23:36.180 --> 23:37.865
Oh, no, I can be there.

23:37.900 --> 23:42.945
- All right, thanks, bye. - Who was
that? - Oh, it was just the salon.

23:42.980 --> 23:47.860
- They want me to work late on Saturday. 
- You and your two new friends? - I failed the audition.

23:47.895 --> 23:51.397
- You said they gave you some work.
- They will if I get my birth mark removed

23:51.432 --> 23:54.865
- and my boobs done. - But you're fine
as you are. - Well, obviously I'm not.

23:54.900 --> 23:59.025
Come on, Josh, you know how much I want this.
 You know I've always thought about getting them done.

23:59.060 --> 24:04.500
- It's not like it's a big deal, loads of girls get their boobs done!
- Not a big deal, are you serious?

24:04.535 --> 24:09.380
I've made my decision, but I could do
with some support, will you come with me?

24:09.415 --> 24:11.420
There's a cancellation this afternoon.

24:14.060 --> 24:16.345
Our miracle recovery cream,

24:16.380 --> 24:19.785
the perfect remedy for
a day at this place.

24:19.820 --> 24:24.100
The glucosamine and yeast
extract gently exfoliates to give

24:24.135 --> 24:27.700
the skin a perfectly even tone. May I?

24:27.735 --> 24:31.425
Thank you. Simply apply like so.

24:31.460 --> 24:34.505
Leave over night and
wash off in the morning.

24:34.540 --> 24:39.060
Wow. It really is a miracle if
it works on your wrinkly old mush.

24:39.095 --> 24:42.420
And the perfect partner,
our daily replenishing cream

24:42.455 --> 24:47.785
containing hyo... hyal... uranate...

24:47.820 --> 24:51.265
to leave the skin feeling
supple and radiant.

24:51.300 --> 24:54.840
And if you buy them both together,
I'll knock another 5% off.

24:54.875 --> 24:58.345
That is low! Setting yourself
up in competition against Maggie!

24:58.380 --> 25:04.340
It's a free market, Janeece... Thank
you... and a very lucrative one.

25:10.060 --> 25:13.780
- You said I had to report in at lunch?
- Consider yourself reported.

25:13.815 --> 25:16.265
How's the campaign trail going?

25:16.300 --> 25:19.545
Crap. You saw. Mr Byrne basically
told everyone I'm a muppet.

25:19.580 --> 25:24.680
Look, you didn't give up, you made
your speech, that's what counts.

25:24.715 --> 25:29.780
You know you can talk to me, don't
you? That's what I'm here for.

25:32.900 --> 25:34.665
I've got this friend

25:34.700 --> 25:38.340
and the Dale Sken Crew have
given him something to look after.

25:38.375 --> 25:41.117
You know, to tie him in.
It's not entirely legit.

25:41.152 --> 25:43.860
- Your friend should take it to the police.
- What?

25:43.895 --> 25:47.465
And get nicked?! With
his record?! Get real.

25:47.500 --> 25:50.420
- He'd be straight back inside.
- They're running an amnesty.

25:50.455 --> 25:52.025
Whatever it is, they'll take it.

25:52.060 --> 25:54.820
- No questions asked.
- They say that, but...

25:59.380 --> 26:01.900
Don't worry, I'll tell him.

26:03.900 --> 26:09.060
Your, erm, friend has to do
what's right. Be his own man.

26:09.095 --> 26:12.260
He doesn't need the Dale Sken Crew.

26:17.620 --> 26:20.465
HE SIGHS

26:20.500 --> 26:24.380
- Vote Trudi for head girl.
- Let me give you this DELIGHTFUL balloon.

26:24.415 --> 26:28.265
- Vote today, girls.
- Trudi?

26:28.300 --> 26:32.385
Taking time out with your
boyfriend, not very dedicated, is it?

26:32.420 --> 26:37.020
- Are you sure you want to go through with this?
- We've got to stand up for ourselves.

26:37.055 --> 26:42.025
- I'll get some more from the art room.
- Head girl, later today.

26:42.060 --> 26:46.185
- Vote Trudi for head girl.
- Enjoy it. Who are you going to vote for?

26:46.220 --> 26:49.820
- I handed out all your leaflets, have you got any more?
- Follow me, shrimp,

26:49.855 --> 26:53.380
we're going to assert our
right to freedom of speech.

26:58.260 --> 27:01.905
- Hello, Madi. How's it going?
- There you go. Fine.

27:01.940 --> 27:05.980
I thought of a few more policies you
could throw into the mix if you wanted.

27:06.015 --> 27:10.020
- I don't need your help, thank you. I'm doing great.
- You certainly are.

27:10.055 --> 27:12.705
That was some performance
at the hustings.

27:12.740 --> 27:15.265
- Quite the public speaker.
- It's simple really.

27:15.300 --> 27:19.660
- You've just got to be honest with people.
- OK, I deserved that.

27:20.700 --> 27:25.020
Look, I was thinking of booking
a spa day at the weekend,

27:25.055 --> 27:27.465
do you fancy coming with me?

27:27.500 --> 27:30.105
- You never know, we might be celebrating.
- We?

27:30.140 --> 27:35.020
Where do you get off? Look, if I win
this, it's nothing to do with you.

27:35.055 --> 27:36.380
Madi!

27:39.540 --> 27:42.385
- I'm sure this is treatable.
- Really?

27:42.420 --> 27:46.825
With a course of laser therapy,
you'll look as good as new.

27:46.860 --> 27:51.200
- Is it that simple? - We've treated
a lot worse. - Honestly, it's amazing!

27:51.235 --> 27:55.540
I can't tell you how much it's going
to change my life. It's like a miracle.

27:55.575 --> 27:58.997
Have you thought any more
about the breast augmentation?

27:59.032 --> 28:02.385
Erm, yeah, I'd like to go
ahead, but can we discuss size?

28:02.420 --> 28:06.420
I should warn you, it's not as
straight forward as the laser treatment.

28:06.455 --> 28:09.297
You are only 18, so the
surgery can be dangerous

28:09.332 --> 28:12.140
because there's a chance
you might still be growing.

28:12.175 --> 28:15.905
So how do you do... the operation?

28:15.940 --> 28:19.060
Well, the surgeon makes a
small incision on the underside

28:19.095 --> 28:22.345
of the breast for the
implant to be inserted.

28:22.380 --> 28:25.820
Takes about an hour and a half.
There's really nothing to it.

28:25.855 --> 28:30.157
- Sounds great.
- Have you thought about what shape you'd like?

28:30.192 --> 28:34.460
There's the round or the anatomical,
sometimes called the teardrop.

28:38.940 --> 28:43.020
Er, can I get my boyfriend
and ask him what he thinks?

28:44.540 --> 28:47.025
This really isn't my area of expertise.

28:47.060 --> 28:49.620
You don't have to decide
now, but if I were you,

28:49.655 --> 28:51.905
I'd think carefully
about the anatomical.

28:51.940 --> 28:56.940
- It's more of a natural shape, it
doesn't look so... - Fake? - Enhanced.

28:56.975 --> 29:00.137
I want them to look enhanced.
That's the whole point.

29:00.172 --> 29:03.265
- How much does it cost?
- I'll get the sales team

29:03.300 --> 29:06.665
- to price up the options for you.
- But it'll be thousands, right?

29:06.700 --> 29:10.580
- We offer payment plans with competitive rates of interest.
- Come on, we're out of here.

29:10.615 --> 29:13.657
Will your sales team
get back to me today?

29:13.692 --> 29:16.700
- I'll make sure that they do.
- Thank you.

29:28.380 --> 29:33.580
- Where you off? - Nowhere. - 
What were you and Chalky talking about earlier? 
- The elections.

29:33.615 --> 29:37.137
- Looked like you were grassing to me.
- I wouldn't. Honest.

29:37.172 --> 29:40.660
You know I wouldn't! I swear!
Look, I just needed a walk.

29:40.695 --> 29:42.500
Got things on my mind, innit?

29:44.860 --> 29:47.665
D'you think I'm some muppet?!

29:47.700 --> 29:51.220
Yo, back up man! Back up!
You think I won't do it?!

29:51.255 --> 29:54.705
I said back up! I'll do
it, you know, now back up!

29:54.740 --> 29:58.360
- Your prints are all over that.
- So? It's only a knife.

29:58.395 --> 30:01.980
Yeah, only the one the police
are looking for in connection to

30:02.015 --> 30:04.065
that robbery last week at the bookies.

30:04.100 --> 30:09.260
Not thinking of quitting the crew are
you? Don't worry mate, we're family, yeah?

me, me, me, me, me, me. ♪

30:33.255 --> 30:34.940
Guys, come on, what's going on?

30:42.300 --> 30:48.060
How did Lawrence add a
twist to Freud's theory?

30:48.095 --> 30:50.100
HE MOUTHS

30:52.820 --> 30:54.380
What's going on?

31:12.900 --> 31:15.625
- What's going on?
- They're protesting over something.

31:15.660 --> 31:21.820
Long may it continue. Peace and
quiet, a rare and precious commodity.

31:21.855 --> 31:24.820
- Do you know what this is all about?
- I can guess.

31:31.340 --> 31:33.105
Brilliant. It's the whole school.

31:33.140 --> 31:35.740
It doesn't take a genius
to work out who's behind it!

31:39.420 --> 31:43.100
Let's see what Mr Byrne has
to say about this, shall we?

31:55.100 --> 31:57.185
You encouraged me to do the audition!

31:57.220 --> 31:59.745
- I didn't know it'd end up like this.
- It's MY body, Josh.

31:59.780 --> 32:03.260
I can see why you'd want to get rid of the
birthmark, but you don't need a boob job.

32:03.295 --> 32:06.865
You're an expert now, are you?! Ignore
the advice of a top modelling agent

32:06.900 --> 32:11.860
- because Josh Stevenson is the new fashionista. -
It's seriously not worth this. - How can you say that?

32:11.895 --> 32:14.580
You know how much I want to
be a model. This is my chance.

32:14.615 --> 32:17.460
I don't know why you
can't just be happy for me?

32:24.020 --> 32:27.025
Lauren, come here.

32:27.060 --> 32:30.705
- I just care! I'm being a mate!
- What are you doing, you idiot?!

32:30.740 --> 32:36.100
- Want some?
- Get it away from me, I'm not a dumb dopehead, 
and I'm not friends with them neither.

32:36.135 --> 32:39.985
- Don't be like that.
- Josh I'm serious. That stuff can mess you up.

32:40.020 --> 32:44.740
- Says the girl who's messing her body up with pointless surgery.
- Oh, it's hardly the same, is it?

32:49.260 --> 32:52.985
Just think, I'll be doing
photo shoots on tropical beaches

32:53.020 --> 32:56.385
while Madi's running a load of
sweaty kids round a playing field.

32:56.420 --> 33:01.740
- Eh?
- Well, I'm going to be a model, and she's going to be a PE teacher. Who has the last laugh?

33:04.260 --> 33:07.905
I'm impressed. No, seriously, I am.

33:07.940 --> 33:12.185
It takes real leadership qualities
to galvanise such unanimous support.

33:12.220 --> 33:16.660
And this is about our initiative somehow
violating your freedom of speech, yes?

33:18.260 --> 33:22.025
It's not JUST the
speech. It's everything.

33:22.060 --> 33:25.940
- It's for the good of the whole school Trudi.
- School? That's a joke.

33:25.975 --> 33:28.425
You're turning this place into a prison.

33:28.460 --> 33:31.860
- Do what you're told, when you're told, how you're told.
- Finn was nearly stabbed.

33:31.895 --> 33:36.660
You're talking to someone who's
been there, who knows how that feels.

33:36.695 --> 33:40.105
These gangs WILL destroy
this school if we let them.

33:40.140 --> 33:43.665
We're not all gang members. We're
individuals in our own right.

33:43.700 --> 33:47.540
You can't take away our freedom of
expression because of a few stupid lads.

33:47.575 --> 33:49.185
That's not what I'm doing at all.

33:49.220 --> 33:52.425
- Then why are you so draconian about it?
- Because it's the only way.

33:52.460 --> 33:58.700
Speak and act properly and you have the freedom
to express your opinions, your ideas, your beliefs.

33:58.735 --> 34:01.397
I know this is a new initiative,
I don't expect people to

34:01.432 --> 34:04.686
support it immediately, but we
have to do something, and now,

34:04.721 --> 34:07.940
if we're going to stop these gangs
taking over this whole school.

34:07.975 --> 34:09.985
That's the last thing I want.

34:10.020 --> 34:12.659
Right, well help me
stop that from happening.

34:15.100 --> 34:16.905
Did you see Madi's balloons?

34:16.940 --> 34:20.219
Why would I waste my
vote on her, smug cow.

34:27.780 --> 34:31.820
- What's going on?
- My office, now.

34:38.020 --> 34:41.480
Sit down. How dare you mock
a fellow student like that.

34:41.514 --> 34:44.940
- I want you to apologise to Madi.
- Why? She deserved it.

34:44.975 --> 34:48.260
I'm sick of her strutting
around like she's lady muck.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.665
You humiliated her
in front of everybody.

34:50.699 --> 34:53.860
- In my book that's bullying.
- All right, fair enough.

34:53.895 --> 34:57.385
What were you doing
out of school anyway?

34:57.420 --> 35:01.985
- It's not funny, Josh. I want
to know. - We were er... - Josh!

35:02.020 --> 35:06.145
Well, it's not like she's not going
to notice when you've had them done.

35:06.180 --> 35:10.940
- Had what done? - She's getting a boob
job. - Josh! - I think you should leave.

35:16.380 --> 35:20.300
- Is this true?
- You told us this morning to make the most of our opportunities.

35:20.335 --> 35:24.220
- I've got a chance to be a model.
- And you think getting a boob job will help you?

35:24.255 --> 35:28.977
- Well, the agency thinks so.
- This is major surgery with serious risks.

35:29.012 --> 35:33.700
I'm 18! I can do what I want! Loads
of girls get it done, it's no big deal.

35:33.735 --> 35:37.105
How are you going to afford
this? It's not going to be cheap.

35:37.140 --> 35:41.740
I've got a Saturday job at the beauty salon.
I can pay for it with what I earn there.

35:41.775 --> 35:45.297
Lauren, you're an intelligent
girl, please use your brain.

35:45.332 --> 35:48.820
Look, what happened to you
wanting to set up your own salon?

35:48.855 --> 35:51.620
Look, just think this through, OK?

35:56.140 --> 35:57.585
Thanks for your patience.

35:57.620 --> 36:02.140
Mr Byrne has explained and convinced
me the new initiative should stay.

36:02.175 --> 36:05.145
It might take a while to get used to,

36:05.180 --> 36:08.705
but it WILL protect our school from
the likes of the Dale Sken Crew.

36:08.740 --> 36:12.345
- So, this was a waste of time? -
Of course not. - So she got it wrong.

36:12.380 --> 36:16.060
- Yet she still wants you to vote her
in as head girl? - Listen to me. - BOOING

36:16.095 --> 36:18.985
I did get it right. We all did.

36:19.020 --> 36:22.980
Because we ALL stood up for what
we believed in. And I'd do it again.

36:23.015 --> 36:26.940
- Yeah, so you could get beat again?
- I didn't get beaten. Far from it.

36:26.975 --> 36:30.037
I've persuaded Mr Byrne
to make himself available

36:30.072 --> 36:34.046
one lunchtime a week to
hear what WE have to say.

36:34.081 --> 36:37.985
- Uninterrupted and uncensored.
- Oooh, big deal!

36:38.020 --> 36:42.185
I know it might not sound exciting
but regular one-to-one access

36:42.220 --> 36:48.980
with the headmaster is a first for Waterloo Road.
And think of it, OUR concerns will be listened to.

36:49.015 --> 36:50.865
Our suggestions considered.

36:50.900 --> 36:53.660
And we won't have to
wait ages for a decision.

36:53.695 --> 36:56.340
We have a voice, let's use it.

36:57.580 --> 37:00.460
D'you know what, I think
we do have our victory.

37:00.495 --> 37:04.380
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING

37:12.900 --> 37:15.545
Well done, Trudi.

37:15.580 --> 37:17.700
I look forward to hearing from everyone.

37:18.820 --> 37:23.705
OK, the voting for your new head
boy and head girl is now open

37:23.740 --> 37:29.140
and the results will be announced 15 minutes
before the final bell, thank you very much!

37:55.220 --> 37:57.185
- Tom!
- Yeah?

37:57.220 --> 38:02.585
Erm... I had to pull Josh
up on his behaviour earlier.

38:02.620 --> 38:06.540
He was acting really quite strangely,
I think you might need to have a word.

38:06.575 --> 38:10.980
- Oh, right. OK, well thank you for the heads up.
- OK.

38:12.300 --> 38:16.380
Hey, what's up?

38:17.860 --> 38:21.620
- Madi's upset. She knows she's not going to win.
- Ah.

38:21.655 --> 38:23.585
I think I just got her hopes up.

38:23.620 --> 38:25.865
No, you encouraged her to be ambitious.

38:25.900 --> 38:31.100
- That's a really good thing.
- Maybe you're right. Listen to me going on.

38:31.135 --> 38:34.437
You're the one bending over backwards
trying to get through to her.

38:34.472 --> 38:37.705
- Yeah. I haven't got very far.
- But you haven't stopped trying!

38:37.740 --> 38:43.020
- You see most people would have given up on her by now.
- I'd never give up on either of them.

38:43.055 --> 38:45.837
But it IS hard not having
that history together.

38:45.872 --> 38:48.786
Well, I've hardly been
the greatest dad, have I?

38:48.821 --> 38:51.665
I wasn't around for them
when they were little.

38:51.700 --> 38:55.660
I was training, travelling to
matches or out with the boys.

38:57.020 --> 39:00.705
- Still getting it wrong now.
- They turned out OK!

39:00.740 --> 39:06.140
What I'm trying to say is that
it's not been easy for me either.

39:06.175 --> 39:09.580
- If I could do it again, it'd be different...
- I know.

39:14.020 --> 39:15.340
What?

39:16.980 --> 39:20.380
Well... why don't we?

39:21.660 --> 39:26.820
- Why don't we have one of our own?
- You're not serious?

39:26.855 --> 39:31.545
It's a stupid idea. I
mean you wanted a career,

39:31.580 --> 39:35.900
- you didn't want kids. - No, I'm
not saying no. I just.. - Really?

39:35.935 --> 39:39.185
It's just come as a bit
of a shock, that's all.

39:39.220 --> 39:42.460
- Well, we need to talk it through properly.
- Great.

39:43.860 --> 39:48.140
- Tonight? - Yeah.
- OK. - SHE LAUGHS

40:00.220 --> 40:04.380
- Miss, you were right. I'm taking your advice.
- Sorry?

40:04.415 --> 40:07.780
You know, using my brain.
Thinking about my future.

40:07.815 --> 40:11.340
Oh, right, good. Well done.

40:11.375 --> 40:13.025
Lauren?

40:13.060 --> 40:16.940
Good luck with it, make the most
of your chances while you have them.

40:16.975 --> 40:20.305
Life can change at the drop of a hat.

40:20.340 --> 40:25.140
- You make sure you're in control OK?
- Don't worry, Miss, I will.

40:37.980 --> 40:41.980
- Matt! - Stop running, please!
- Matt! - What are you doing here?

40:42.015 --> 40:43.865
If you answered your phone, you'd know!

40:43.900 --> 40:47.060
- Sorry, we've had a bit of a situation.
- Well, so have I.

40:47.095 --> 40:49.625
- I've got a flat tyre.
- And so you drove here?!

40:49.660 --> 40:53.500
- I'm already late, aren't I? -
For what?! - My ante natal yoga.

40:53.535 --> 40:56.785
- LAUGHTER
- Keys.

40:56.820 --> 41:01.240
Right, guys, this is Miss Matthews. She'll
look after you for a bit. Behave for her.

41:01.275 --> 41:05.660
- Hang on, hang on, you can't leave me with...
- I've got to change a tyre, haven't I?

41:05.695 --> 41:09.260
I'll only be a few minutes.
Just get them settled.

41:17.220 --> 41:20.985
Hey, I know how I can make some
extra money to pay for the surgery.

41:21.020 --> 41:25.020
- I just need your help. - Doing what? -
Meet me in the changing rooms in ten, OK?

41:31.060 --> 41:36.180
- What's going on? - Free period. - You know what
I'm talking about. That was out of order with Madi.

41:36.215 --> 41:40.180
- It was only a joke. I didn't know she'd
hear me. - What is wrong with you?! - What?!

41:40.215 --> 41:44.505
You know what. You stink of it!

41:44.540 --> 41:47.820
- Empty your pockets now!
- Why? - Empty your pockets!

41:56.460 --> 41:58.780
With me!

42:00.780 --> 42:05.540
- I'm sorry, Dad!
- If I catch you with it again, I'll march you down the police station myself.

42:05.575 --> 42:10.700
- Is that clear?! - Yes! - Now get rid
of it! - I won't do it again. I promise.

42:12.820 --> 42:15.620
I'll make sure you
don't. You're grounded.

42:18.300 --> 42:22.900
- CHATTING AND LAUGHING
- Come on! OK, Matt won't...

42:22.935 --> 42:26.465
Mr Wilding, won't be long. Quiet! Oh!

42:26.500 --> 42:33.500
- Sorry. - Oh! - Are
you OK? - I'm fine.

42:33.535 --> 42:35.860
- Who are you?
- Sit down.

42:35.895 --> 42:38.665
SHOUTING AND LAUGHING

42:38.700 --> 42:42.780
All of you, just get on with
whatever you're supposed to be doing!

42:42.815 --> 42:46.265
SHOUTING AND BANGING ON THE PIANO

42:46.300 --> 42:51.060
- SHE WINCES - Can you keep it down,
please! - Miss! Are you all right?

42:51.095 --> 42:55.140
- SHE GROANS
- Oh, my God.

42:55.175 --> 42:57.060
SHE WINCES

42:59.300 --> 43:02.425
- Dad just found my weed.
- Good.

43:02.460 --> 43:05.425
I don't know whether I'll
be able to do this, you know.

43:05.460 --> 43:09.980
Well, how much of that stuff did you smoke? I'm not
asking you to paint people's nails, just be a look out.

43:10.015 --> 43:14.060
Oi, you two. Do you fancy
getting your nails done?

43:14.095 --> 43:16.825
Well, we're meant to be in class.

43:16.860 --> 43:21.380
- I'll be dead quick, it'll only take five minutes.
 - Two for the price of one? - Go on then.

43:21.415 --> 43:25.900
- But you've got to show them off to everyone and tell them where to find me.
- Ooh, you're on.

43:26.940 --> 43:31.700
- Sir, Sir. - What's wrong? -
It's Miss Matthews! Come quick!

43:39.300 --> 43:43.625
- What's happening?
- It's Rosie. She's having pains.

43:43.660 --> 43:46.180
- Has she gone into labour?
- She can't have, it's way too early.

43:46.215 --> 43:50.017
- Right, everyone out please.
- Come on! - What happened?

43:50.052 --> 43:53.785
- That girl banged the door into me.
- Ambulance, please...

43:53.820 --> 43:57.620
It's a dead good idea. Saves me a trip
now I know I can get them done at school.

43:57.655 --> 44:01.900
It's not just nails. I'm going to
bring in the full works tomorrow.

44:01.935 --> 44:03.945
Make up, hair extensions, fake tan...

44:03.980 --> 44:07.420
- You're going to make a killing.
- That's the idea.

44:12.620 --> 44:16.260
- What's going on in here? - Nail bar.
- I can fit you in, if you want, Mags.

44:16.295 --> 44:19.237
- It's only a fiver.
- I cannot afford it pet.

44:19.272 --> 44:22.145
I've not sold a thing
from the new catalogue.

44:22.180 --> 44:25.740
I bet it don't help with Grantly
setting himself up in competition.

44:25.775 --> 44:28.665
Hahaha! Budgen? Pull the other one.

44:28.700 --> 44:33.700
- What does that old curmudgeon know 
about health and beauty, eh?
- SHE LAUGHS

44:35.340 --> 44:36.900
You're serious, aren't you?

44:43.940 --> 44:46.385
- Right. Deep breaths all right.
- SHE GROANS

44:46.420 --> 44:50.580
- Ah, can you help her please?
- How far gone, is she?

44:50.615 --> 44:54.705
- Erm... 33, 34 weeks.
- What's your name, Love?

44:54.740 --> 44:59.300
- It's Rosie.
- Rosie, have you had any problems with you pregnancy so far?

44:59.335 --> 45:02.785
- No. - Anything we should be
aware of? - No. It's all been fine.

45:02.820 --> 45:06.580
- SHE GROANS - What's wrong? - She's
having contractions, she's in labour.

45:06.615 --> 45:09.900
- She can't be! It's too early!
- Rosie, just stay calm.

45:09.935 --> 45:14.380
We're going to take you
to hospital. SHE PANTS

45:15.660 --> 45:20.080
The town Vanity is a
metaphor for Thackery's belief

45:20.115 --> 45:24.500
that people are, "abominably
foolish and selfish. "

45:24.535 --> 45:26.865
A view not without its merits.

45:26.900 --> 45:30.780
- KNOCK ON THE DOOR - Yes? -
Can I speak with Trudi, please?

45:33.100 --> 45:36.700
If you must. Be quick.

45:36.735 --> 45:40.020
Right! Homework.

45:43.700 --> 45:45.785
SHE GROWLS

45:45.820 --> 45:49.900
- I'm going to have to get Lauren to redo these!
- Lauren?

45:49.935 --> 45:53.980
- She's a right little artist.
- And when did she do these?

45:55.220 --> 45:57.780
- At lunchtime.
- And they're still wet?

46:06.060 --> 46:08.220
Madi!

46:09.980 --> 46:14.340
- Look, about earlier, I was out of order I'm...
- I deserved it.

46:14.375 --> 46:16.820
- Any chance I could get my nails done?
- Sure.

46:23.620 --> 46:25.065
What's going on?

46:25.100 --> 46:27.825
You told me to think about
setting up my own business.

46:27.860 --> 46:30.905
- Not during school!
- But she's got a real talent for it.

46:30.940 --> 46:35.105
What if I do it at lunchtimes? You
did say I should set up a salon?

46:35.140 --> 46:39.820
All right, I will run it past Mr Byrne and if
he's OK it, you can use my science lab, right?

46:39.855 --> 46:41.580
Thanks, Mrs Diamond.

46:45.500 --> 46:48.145
- From Madi. -
Seriously? - Yeah.

46:48.180 --> 46:52.100
Mrs Diamond said we can set up in
the science lab every lunchtime.

46:52.135 --> 46:56.037
- We're going to clean up. Which is a good thing, innit?
- I suppose.

46:56.072 --> 46:59.940
- So?
- The clinic called. It's going to cost four grand for my boob job

46:59.975 --> 47:03.065
and I worked out that even with
our thing and the Saturday job,

47:03.100 --> 47:07.065
- it could take me three years to save up.
- Is it really worth it?

47:07.100 --> 47:11.260
- Especially with the good little business we've got going.
- But I wanted to be a model.

47:11.295 --> 47:14.305
Even if you wait, there's no
guarantee you'll get any work.

47:14.340 --> 47:17.940
Look what you've achieved in an
afternoon. Stick with the business,

47:17.975 --> 47:21.257
and who knows where
you'll be in three years.

47:21.292 --> 47:24.540
Come on, we'd better get
to the election results.

47:24.575 --> 47:26.625
I'm sorry!

47:26.660 --> 47:31.140
- I'm so sorry! - Hey, it's not your fault.
It's going to be all right. - SHE SCREAMS

47:31.175 --> 47:36.425
- We need to get her to the hospital now!
- I've been so selfish.

47:36.460 --> 47:42.060
- All I've been doing is moaning about her all day. -
Don't beat yourself up. 
- Sir, sir, is Miss Matthews OK?!

47:42.095 --> 47:45.380
- Yeah, you get yourself back inside, Naseem.
- I want Matt!

47:45.415 --> 47:50.260
Rosie wants you. We need
to get going. ROSIE SCREAMS

47:54.380 --> 47:55.905
Excuse me?

47:55.940 --> 48:00.100
- My sister banged a door into Miss Matthews. Did that cause it?
- No.

48:00.135 --> 48:03.900
This just happens sometimes
and we never know the reason.

48:03.935 --> 48:06.580
- Tell your sister it's not her fault.
- Thanks.

48:11.060 --> 48:13.780
SIREN BLARES

48:18.060 --> 48:22.380
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

48:25.420 --> 48:28.505
So, the moment you've
all been waiting for.

48:28.540 --> 48:31.380
The announcement of your
new head boy and head girl.

48:31.415 --> 48:34.340
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

48:37.660 --> 48:39.545
- Where's Trudi?
- No idea, sir.

48:39.580 --> 48:43.180
I'd like to thank the candidates
for all of their hard work.

48:43.215 --> 48:47.100
And I'd like to thank you
for exercising your right

48:47.135 --> 48:49.857
to have a say in the
future of this school.

48:49.892 --> 48:52.580
So without any further ado, here we go.

48:52.615 --> 48:55.900
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

49:04.780 --> 49:08.380
Your new head girl for the year

49:08.415 --> 49:10.837
is Trudi Siddiqui.

49:10.872 --> 49:13.260
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

49:22.820 --> 49:25.120
Your new head girl!

49:25.155 --> 49:27.420
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

49:30.860 --> 49:32.905
I look forward to working with you.

49:32.940 --> 49:36.060
- I'm sure you'll keep me on my toes...
- Thanks, Sir.

49:38.660 --> 49:40.820
And your new head boy...

49:43.100 --> 49:48.260
Finn Sharkey. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

49:55.220 --> 49:58.100
Thank you all very much,
I'll see you tomorrow.

50:04.500 --> 50:08.545
Listen, mate, no need to
worry about no poxy elections.

50:08.580 --> 50:14.460
They don't understand us. Play by
our own rules, yeah? So, we're cool?

50:15.660 --> 50:21.020
- GABOS. - GABOS. See you on
the outside, yeah? - Yeah man.

50:21.055 --> 50:24.145
Unlucky, Tariq. It's the
taking part that counts.

50:24.180 --> 50:26.980
I'm sure Mr Byrne's been
impressed by your commitment.

50:27.015 --> 50:28.905
Fair outcome I suppose.

50:28.940 --> 50:32.300
- But I'm glad I did it and thanks for all the encouragement.
- Ah,

50:32.335 --> 50:36.705
don't mention it. Your,
em, friend, did he...?

50:36.740 --> 50:40.700
- Yeah, yeah, that's all been sorted.
- Excellent. Right.

50:40.735 --> 50:42.860
- I'll see you in the morning.
- Cheers.

50:44.820 --> 50:46.785
How dare you undercut us!

50:46.820 --> 50:49.625
Scared of a little healthy
competition, are we?

50:49.660 --> 50:54.820
- How can I compete with you when you're
 giving it away for less than cost?
- It's called loss leading.

50:54.855 --> 50:58.260
- You're going to put me out of business at this rate.
- Free market.

50:58.295 --> 51:01.620
- How much do you earn, Grantly?
- Puh! I'm a teacher.

51:01.655 --> 51:03.505
Ipso facto, a pittance.

51:03.540 --> 51:07.825
Well, it's a damn sight more than
a dinner lady. I rely on that money.

51:07.860 --> 51:15.420
- They've put the rates up at Fleur's home and I need the money.
- So do I.

51:17.140 --> 51:19.305
Wait!

51:19.340 --> 51:23.180
A good business is greater than
the sum of its parts, is it not?

51:28.220 --> 51:33.980
- Is that some poncey way of saying you want to join forces?
- OK, Matt.

51:34.015 --> 51:38.380
Thanks for letting me know. Yeah,
we're all thinking about you here.

51:38.415 --> 51:42.505
- Bye. - Is Rosie OK? - She
gave birth in the ambulance.

51:42.540 --> 51:46.680
Rosie's OK but the baby's critical. God
knows what they're both going through.

51:46.715 --> 51:50.820
- Well, if there's anything we can do.
- I'm going down to the hospital now

51:50.855 --> 51:54.345
but I think it's going
to be a waiting game.

51:54.380 --> 51:59.460
Fingers crossed we'll all be
wetting the baby's head soon enough.

52:16.900 --> 52:20.820
Hey, I'm sure Lauren and
Josh didn't mean to upset you.

52:20.855 --> 52:23.540
And you'd know about that?

52:23.575 --> 52:28.825
Madi, I'm so sorry.

52:28.860 --> 52:32.420
The last thing I wanted to
do was hurt you or your dad.

52:32.455 --> 52:34.665
If I could change it, I would.

52:34.700 --> 52:40.620
- It was a mistake, a seriously bad mistake.
- Like this.

52:41.860 --> 52:44.305
I only joined up for a bit of a laugh.

52:44.340 --> 52:48.080
Trudi's the one with all
the ideas. What have I got?

52:48.115 --> 52:51.820
- Balloons and badges.
- You'd make a great head girl!

52:51.855 --> 52:55.105
I think we both know that's not true.

52:55.140 --> 52:58.025
I was just stupid for
getting carried away with it.

52:58.060 --> 53:02.500
- You're definitely your father's daughter.
- Yeah, I know!

53:02.535 --> 53:05.985
That's a good thing. Wish
I was like you at school.

53:06.020 --> 53:10.340
I was the shy, nervous one who never
put their name forward for anything.

53:10.375 --> 53:14.660
- So, who does that make me?
- Emma Martin. Life and soul of the party.

53:14.695 --> 53:18.940
Always up for anything. What I
wouldn't have given to be her.

53:18.975 --> 53:22.540
You haven't turned out too badly.

53:31.940 --> 53:34.900
Oi, you forgot this.

53:37.980 --> 53:39.545
Fair's fair.

53:39.580 --> 53:43.180
- You helped me out. - Your needs are
greater than mine. - And why's that?

53:43.215 --> 53:44.625
You know. The op?

53:44.660 --> 53:47.940
- Oh, so you're saying there's something wrong with me?
- No, but...

53:47.975 --> 53:51.425
Exactly, you were right. I should
have listened to you earlier.

53:51.460 --> 53:56.220
- I cancelled the boob job. - What about the modelling?
- I'm better than some catalogue clothes horse.

53:56.255 --> 54:00.460
There's more important things to worry
about than what I look like the whole time.

54:00.495 --> 54:04.340
- I'm going to use what I've got. Not here. But up here.
- Good for you.

54:04.375 --> 54:08.097
Here. I'm still going to
get the birth mark removed.

54:08.132 --> 54:11.785
It's a grand, but it'll take
me a few months to save up

54:11.820 --> 54:15.545
but I'll be able to afford it if
I keep on with the beauty therapy.

54:15.580 --> 54:21.900
- Oi! - You need to knock those
drugs on the head. - Yeah, I'll try...

54:21.935 --> 54:25.465
Hey, Lauren! Can you finish
these off for me later?

54:25.500 --> 54:30.740
- Yeah, come round to mine now, if you
want? - Cheers. - Hey, congratulations.

54:30.775 --> 54:34.897
- Yeah, dream ticket. Thanks guys..
- Yeah, congratulations, mate.

54:34.932 --> 54:39.020
I will be needing an entertainment
officer, like, if you're interested.

54:39.055 --> 54:41.860
Yeah, totally! Sound!

54:51.620 --> 54:53.060
Dad?

54:58.460 --> 55:00.820
I'm really sorry about earlier.

55:02.900 --> 55:05.785
I've heard it all before, Josh.

55:05.820 --> 55:09.900
Is it not a big enough lesson for
you that I ended up in hospital?!

55:09.935 --> 55:13.980
- Are you really that stupid?!
- Sorry. I promise I won't do it again.

55:22.740 --> 55:26.545
Are you going to Speedway tonight?

55:26.580 --> 55:31.100
- Aces versus the Pirates, what do you think?
- Yeah. Silly question.

55:31.135 --> 55:34.705
- You're coming with me.
- I thought I was grounded.

55:34.740 --> 55:38.660
Ah, well, you're coming with me
where I can keep an eye on you.

55:38.695 --> 55:40.540
I'll get changed.

55:45.500 --> 55:47.145
- You all set?
- Nearly.

55:47.180 --> 55:52.460
- Just sorting out lesson cover for Matt.
- Oh. How are they doing?

55:52.495 --> 55:55.545
Rosie's all right, but the
baby is still really struggling.

55:55.580 --> 55:58.620
- Should we pay them a visit on our way home?
- Probably best not to.

55:58.655 --> 56:01.945
They know where we are
if they need anything.

56:01.980 --> 56:07.900
- And there was me going to suggest that we take the phone off the hook cos Zack and Madi are out.
- Are they?

56:07.935 --> 56:11.300
Mm. Give us a chance to
talk babies of our own?

56:11.335 --> 56:13.785
Maybe even make a start?

56:13.820 --> 56:17.185
- You are up for this, aren't you?
- Yes.

56:17.220 --> 56:22.060
- SHE LAUGHS NERVOUSLY - I'll
catch you up. - See you in the car.

57:01.980 --> 57:03.945
Grady, I can't.

57:03.980 --> 57:06.340
- Give up again tomorrow.
- He's trouble, mate.

57:08.180 --> 57:12.420
- Vanessa Cooper, here for the Head of English.
- Oh, sorry, Nikki Boston.

57:12.455 --> 57:16.060
- Jealous, Kyle? - No, I don't
go out with skanks. - What?!

57:16.095 --> 57:19.797
Are you trying to say you've
enjoyed having us around?

57:19.832 --> 57:23.500
- Um, er... in short, yes, very much.
- SHE LAUGHS

57:23.535 --> 57:25.300
Let go of me!

57:29.660 --> 57:31.625
- You've got some explaining to do.
- Dad!

57:31.660 --> 57:36.520
- You've had enough chances. Now you're going to 
be treated like any other pupil. Inside!
- Tom, wait!

57:36.555 --> 57:40.907
And what was he doing on this march of yours apart
from fighting?! After everything we went through,

57:40.942 --> 57:45.260
- you promised me. - Course I promised, I had
to. - Then why are you still smoking this crap?!

57:45.295 --> 57:46.980
TELL ME!
