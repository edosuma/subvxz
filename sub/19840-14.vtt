WEBVTT

00:00.393 --> 00:03.008
What's up with you and Darius?

00:03.010 --> 00:04.610
Previously on Greenleaf...

00:04.612 --> 00:06.178
Yeah, we're taking a break.

00:06.180 --> 00:08.881
Call Darius. Breaks are for punks.

00:08.883 --> 00:11.083
Tickets to Floodgate?

00:11.085 --> 00:12.951
That's the same weekend as my cotillion.

00:12.953 --> 00:15.254
- You do this instead.
- I don't want to.

00:16.974 --> 00:19.024
- That hurt!
- Did it to yourself.

00:19.026 --> 00:20.559
Take me home.

00:20.561 --> 00:22.027
They beat up my Basie.

00:22.029 --> 00:23.662
The people that he owes money to.

00:23.664 --> 00:25.564
They beat him up bad.

00:25.566 --> 00:27.293
I need your help.

00:27.295 --> 00:28.574
Jabari, what are we doing?

00:28.601 --> 00:30.501
- Making music.
- No!

00:30.503 --> 00:32.235
- Us.
- What about us?

00:32.238 --> 00:34.505
Do you like me or what?

00:34.507 --> 00:36.840
All I say is I have sinned against God.

00:36.842 --> 00:38.742
Good news is,

00:38.744 --> 00:41.278
Jacob Greenleaf, an honest man.

00:41.280 --> 00:43.202
And that's why I'm handing
this ministry over to him.

00:43.204 --> 00:44.855
He's the leader you all deserve.

00:44.857 --> 00:46.034
Where's Basie?

00:46.036 --> 00:48.297
I tried my best to get him to stay.

00:48.298 --> 00:51.299
How could a man run off and leave a
woman as loyal as this in a lurch?

00:51.301 --> 00:54.169
You have a message from Bishop
Jeffries on the voicemail.

00:54.171 --> 00:55.504
I'll call him back later, thank you.

00:55.506 --> 00:56.838
Mae.

00:56.840 --> 00:59.341
Don't say anything, please.

00:59.343 --> 01:00.842
- Hello?
- James.

01:00.844 --> 01:01.938
- It's Lionel.
- There's something

01:01.940 --> 01:02.962
we need to talk about.

01:02.964 --> 01:04.605
In person.

01:08.632 --> 01:10.698
This isn't easy for me, James.

01:10.700 --> 01:13.435
Lionel, just go ahead
and speak your peace.

01:15.915 --> 01:17.448
I feel like I owe you an apology

01:17.450 --> 01:18.649
ahead of time.

01:18.651 --> 01:20.751
Because what I'm about to say

01:20.753 --> 01:22.520
could shake the very
foundation of your family

01:22.522 --> 01:23.587
the way it has shaken mine.

01:23.589 --> 01:24.655
Just say it.

01:28.690 --> 01:31.562
Aaron is gay.

01:31.564 --> 01:33.898
My Lord.

01:33.900 --> 01:35.199
I feel the same way.

01:35.201 --> 01:36.702
How did you find out?

01:36.704 --> 01:38.370
Well, the way I found out was,

01:39.443 --> 01:41.093
we recently lost our chief council

01:41.095 --> 01:43.340
back in Charlotte to a stroke.

01:43.879 --> 01:46.210
And it occurred to me
it would be a pleasure

01:46.212 --> 01:48.212
to give Aaron the job.

01:48.214 --> 01:49.902
Well, what a pleasant thought.

01:49.904 --> 01:51.398
So, I took it upon myself,

01:51.400 --> 01:53.396
foolishly, I now see,

01:53.397 --> 01:55.331
to fly down to Montgomery

01:55.333 --> 01:56.865
and surprise him with the offer.

01:56.867 --> 01:58.556
- No.
- Wait.

01:58.558 --> 01:59.853
Aaron's living in Montgomery now?

01:59.855 --> 02:00.903
Yes, he took a job

02:00.905 --> 02:02.671
with the Southern Poverty Law Center.

02:02.673 --> 02:04.233
Well, that's impressive.

02:04.842 --> 02:06.375
- Impressive.
- Yes.

02:06.377 --> 02:07.843
When he opened the door to the apartment

02:07.845 --> 02:09.279
and saw me there,

02:10.043 --> 02:12.314
he immediately behaved rather oddly.

02:12.316 --> 02:13.782
Now, I know it was early,

02:13.784 --> 02:15.951
but he's always been an early riser,

02:15.953 --> 02:17.579
so I knew that wasn't the problem.

02:18.289 --> 02:21.457
And then it became apparent
that he had a visitor.

02:21.459 --> 02:24.493
And I got this distinct impression

02:24.495 --> 02:26.629
that I had interrupted something.

02:26.922 --> 02:30.299
That visitor was Kevin.

02:33.834 --> 02:35.834
- You knew about this?
- No, no.

02:35.836 --> 02:37.735
No. No.

02:37.737 --> 02:39.471
We've known Kevin's gay,

02:39.473 --> 02:41.239
but Aaron and Kevin?

02:41.241 --> 02:42.240
No, of course not.

02:42.242 --> 02:43.475
They're living together?

02:43.477 --> 02:44.709
No, no.

02:44.711 --> 02:46.211
He's living in Montgomery now?

02:46.213 --> 02:48.079
- Let's hear what he has to say.
- Just visiting

02:48.081 --> 02:49.814
from Memphis for the weekend.

02:49.816 --> 02:52.016
In a one bedroom.

02:54.656 --> 02:56.187
I guess I didn't have to come here

02:56.189 --> 02:57.552
to tell you this in person after all.

02:57.553 --> 02:59.353
No, we're glad you did. We are.

02:59.355 --> 03:02.499
So, how did you leave it with Aaron?

03:03.078 --> 03:05.102
- Are you two talking or...
- No.

03:05.809 --> 03:08.569
He will not listen to reason.

03:09.179 --> 03:11.279
According to him, he was born gay.

03:14.808 --> 03:16.861
James, I need you to talk to him.

03:18.478 --> 03:20.445
- Me?
- You have a way with him.

03:20.447 --> 03:21.879
He trusts you. You know that.

03:22.728 --> 03:24.782
And with Patrice gone,

03:25.355 --> 03:27.482
strange to say,

03:28.221 --> 03:29.554
he's all I got left.

03:31.711 --> 03:32.711
Of course.

03:33.746 --> 03:35.246
Thank you.

04:34.659 --> 04:37.059
Hey.

04:37.061 --> 04:38.461
Wow.

04:38.463 --> 04:40.096
Can't remember the last time

04:40.098 --> 04:41.621
you woke me up like that.

04:41.788 --> 04:44.956
Well, it's your first day
as senior pastor, pastor,

04:44.958 --> 04:48.126
and I wanted to get you
off to a good start.

04:48.128 --> 04:49.628
I don't remember that being part

04:49.630 --> 04:53.765
of the benefits package,
but I'll take it.

04:53.767 --> 04:55.233
Gladly.

04:55.235 --> 04:57.318
What time is the staff meeting?

04:57.319 --> 04:59.658
About 9:00, 9:15.

05:00.322 --> 05:03.990
I don't know, Britney
didn't seem to really care.

05:03.992 --> 05:06.493
Well, it must be nice
to have some leeway.

05:06.495 --> 05:07.827
We're gonna have to get that

05:07.829 --> 05:09.663
straightened out.

05:09.665 --> 05:12.032
Yeah, I guess so.

05:12.034 --> 05:14.084
I know a lot of people
are gonna have some questions.

05:14.086 --> 05:16.536
I know I will.

05:16.538 --> 05:17.971
- Excellence Prep.
- Hi.

05:17.973 --> 05:20.907
I am going to be coming
into the office late today,

05:20.909 --> 05:24.077
but I will be available
on my cell phone.

05:24.217 --> 05:26.012
Yes, of course, Kerissa.

05:26.014 --> 05:27.347
I'll let everybody know.

05:27.349 --> 05:28.848
- By lunch?
- Yes.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.483
Definitely by chapel.

05:30.485 --> 05:31.651
Definitely by chapel.

05:31.653 --> 05:32.576
Okay, thank you.

05:32.578 --> 05:33.578
You, too.

05:36.211 --> 05:38.131
What you got going on today?

05:38.132 --> 05:40.932
- I'm coming with you.
- Yeah?

05:40.934 --> 05:42.167
Is that okay?

05:42.169 --> 05:45.137
Yeah, it just hadn't occurred to me.

05:45.139 --> 05:47.239
Well, you said that folks had questions.

05:47.241 --> 05:49.908
Well, it's the perfect time
for the new first lady

05:49.910 --> 05:51.710
to set a tone.

05:53.147 --> 05:54.980
I couldn't agree more.

05:57.597 --> 05:59.464
S... hey.

05:59.466 --> 06:01.733
See, that's... the way work works

06:01.735 --> 06:04.644
is if you do what you love for your job,

06:04.645 --> 06:06.645
then that means...

06:06.647 --> 06:08.747
what you love turns into work.

06:08.749 --> 06:10.849
And you can do something
else for your job,

06:10.851 --> 06:13.453
but that means you have less
time to do what you love.

06:13.454 --> 06:16.526
A lot less time.

06:17.525 --> 06:19.091
Hey, there!

06:19.093 --> 06:20.326
What's up?

06:20.328 --> 06:21.727
Good news.

06:21.729 --> 06:23.696
Is it fit for little ears,

06:23.698 --> 06:24.930
because I am sitting here

06:24.932 --> 06:27.366
with my very handsome manager?

06:27.368 --> 06:29.001
It's about Tamela Mann.

06:29.003 --> 06:31.603
She want to record my song?

06:31.605 --> 06:33.005
No, better.

06:36.185 --> 06:37.718
Look, I'm sorry about
what happened to Kevin

06:37.720 --> 06:39.586
and how you and Lady Mae
had to find out.

06:39.588 --> 06:41.956
I just... I didn't mean
to cause trouble.

06:41.958 --> 06:43.657
Well, thank you for saying that.

06:43.659 --> 06:45.726
It certainly isn't the way
I would've done anything,

06:45.728 --> 06:47.409
- but...
- Me neither, in retrospect.

06:47.410 --> 06:49.977
But to be clear, Kevin made
his own choices since then,

06:49.979 --> 06:52.279
and we don't hold you
accountable for any of that.

06:52.281 --> 06:54.381
He's having a hard time.

06:54.383 --> 06:55.716
I can't see how he couldn't be

06:55.718 --> 06:57.526
so far from his only son.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.736
Must seem like hell.

07:00.610 --> 07:02.209
Bishop?

07:02.234 --> 07:04.034
- Yes?
- Before we go in there.

07:06.515 --> 07:07.847
I can't change who I am.

07:07.849 --> 07:09.916
I can't not be gay.

07:09.918 --> 07:11.985
You know that, right?

07:11.987 --> 07:14.888
Aaron, what I know is

07:14.890 --> 07:17.003
only God knows the heart.

07:17.559 --> 07:19.559
1 Kings 8:39.

07:20.048 --> 07:24.063
Look, if Jacob were
to tell you he was gay,

07:24.065 --> 07:25.932
would you still treat him this way?

07:25.934 --> 07:28.281
Like he committed some kind of crime?

07:29.264 --> 07:31.031
No, probably not.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.633
Then please, tell my father that.

07:33.635 --> 07:34.772
He'll listen to you.

07:34.774 --> 07:37.337
Look, why don't we all just sit down

07:37.339 --> 07:39.626
and not get ahead of ourselves?

07:40.060 --> 07:41.493
The Lord's gonna find a way

07:41.495 --> 07:43.321
for us all, amen?

07:43.696 --> 07:44.795
I don't know.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.263
- I hope so.
- No, no, no.

07:46.265 --> 07:48.899
Let's just claim it,

07:48.901 --> 07:50.203
and He will.

07:51.270 --> 07:53.270
- Come on.
- Okay.

07:53.272 --> 07:54.771
Mama.

07:54.773 --> 07:55.939
Mama, I need your help.

07:55.941 --> 07:57.474
- What?
- Hi, Little Bit.

07:57.476 --> 07:59.875
- Gigi, can you hold him for a second.
- Gladly.

07:59.876 --> 08:02.120
Now, how might I be of assistance?

08:02.122 --> 08:03.621
- Now, just remember to breathe.
- Okay.

08:03.623 --> 08:06.357
You know, brain needs air.

08:06.359 --> 08:08.759
Tamela Mann asked me
to sing backup for her

08:08.761 --> 08:10.394
on her national tour.

08:10.396 --> 08:11.696
- Seriously?
- Yes!

08:11.698 --> 08:13.164
Jabari just called to tell me.

08:13.166 --> 08:14.899
My gosh, congratulations!

08:14.901 --> 08:17.768
- Thank you.
- Well, what about Nathan?

08:17.770 --> 08:19.337
Well, that's the point.

08:19.339 --> 08:21.339
So, Jabari said the tour
would pay for a nanny,

08:21.341 --> 08:22.640
but outside of you the only person

08:22.642 --> 08:25.209
I'm comfortable with would be Maricel.

08:25.211 --> 08:26.911
For long periods of time.

08:26.913 --> 08:28.212
No, no, I get it, don't worry.

08:28.214 --> 08:29.447
Could you part with her?

08:29.449 --> 08:31.616
Well, have you asked her about this?

08:31.618 --> 08:33.720
No, I wanted to check with you first.

08:33.721 --> 08:35.821
Well, now, she has a job

08:35.823 --> 08:36.955
and a life of her own

08:36.957 --> 08:38.056
and a daughter,

08:38.058 --> 08:39.924
but... well, I don't know.

08:39.927 --> 08:41.727
How long will it be?

08:41.729 --> 08:43.227
Ten weeks.

08:43.230 --> 08:44.630
On the road with a baby?

08:44.632 --> 08:46.965
Mama, that is basically two months.

08:46.967 --> 08:50.569
Ooh, I remember when your father
was an itinerant preacher,

08:50.571 --> 08:54.640
and we would just lug Gigi
and Jacob from town to town.

08:54.642 --> 08:57.809
It almost killed all four of us.

08:57.811 --> 08:59.103
- Mama.
- Mama.

08:59.104 --> 09:01.671
Come on, this is a great opportunity.

09:01.673 --> 09:04.074
- Thank you.
- Well, it doesn't feel big to me.

09:04.076 --> 09:07.077
Can I at least ask Maricel?

09:07.079 --> 09:09.279
I have long stopped daring to imagine

09:09.281 --> 09:10.380
what people are capable of,

09:10.382 --> 09:13.350
so you just machinate on.

09:13.352 --> 09:16.753
Thank you, Mama. Mwah.

09:18.490 --> 09:20.057
- Are you ready?
- You just keep in mind, now...

09:20.059 --> 09:21.258
that the only way

09:21.260 --> 09:22.388
you could have this conversation

09:22.390 --> 09:24.761
was that you could hand
that child to your sister,

09:24.763 --> 09:26.925
and it won't be like that on the road.

09:26.950 --> 09:29.066
Love you.

09:29.068 --> 09:31.234
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

09:31.236 --> 09:34.629
Just seems like a lot of moving pieces

09:34.630 --> 09:35.763
to sing backup.

09:35.765 --> 09:37.097
Just pray about it.

09:37.099 --> 09:38.687
Just pray about it, it's all right.

09:39.201 --> 09:41.101
Who is that?

09:41.103 --> 09:43.216
It's Darius.

09:43.218 --> 09:45.639
He was just running the
menu by me for tonight.

09:45.641 --> 09:47.400
- He's cooking.
- Well, that's thoughtful.

09:47.402 --> 09:49.243
It is. It is.

09:50.909 --> 09:55.194
So, let us speak our minds,

09:55.195 --> 09:56.371
listen,

09:57.464 --> 09:59.998
and try to find the will of the Father.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.733
Amen?

10:03.095 --> 10:04.895
Amen.

10:05.779 --> 10:06.911
Amen.

10:11.211 --> 10:12.477
Amen.

10:18.344 --> 10:19.813
We're just so happy that you're back.

10:19.837 --> 10:21.270
We all knew what a good thing

10:21.272 --> 10:22.772
you had going with your old church.

10:22.774 --> 10:25.307
Well, this is good, too, though.

10:25.966 --> 10:28.010
Where's Tasha's office?

10:28.012 --> 10:29.712
Just next door to Jacob's.

10:29.714 --> 10:30.713
How convenient.

10:30.715 --> 10:31.947
You're gonna keep Tasha on

10:31.949 --> 10:33.449
as head of Music Ministry, I hope.

10:33.451 --> 10:35.284
Whatever Sister Skanks wants to do,

10:35.286 --> 10:37.420
- we're here to help her do it.
- Praise God.

10:37.422 --> 10:39.355
I think having the work has
been a welcome distraction.

10:39.357 --> 10:41.370
I'm sure. Poor thing.

10:41.372 --> 10:43.459
You're not gonna find another
voice like that either.

10:43.461 --> 10:45.061
Powerful.

10:51.623 --> 10:52.889
Thank you.

10:56.412 --> 10:57.744
Anything else, pastor?

10:57.746 --> 10:59.579
No, we're good.

10:59.581 --> 11:01.381
- Thanks.
- Then I'll go marshal the troops.

11:01.383 --> 11:02.482
Britney?

11:02.484 --> 11:03.784
If you run into Tasha,

11:03.786 --> 11:05.685
can you tell her I'm looking for her?

11:05.687 --> 11:07.821
- Of course.
- Thank you.

11:10.320 --> 11:11.920
Kerissa?

11:11.922 --> 11:14.122
- What?
- So, Britney is the treasurer.

11:14.124 --> 11:15.257
She's not my assistant.

11:15.259 --> 11:16.641
Call Tasha yourself.

11:16.666 --> 11:17.732
I did, twice.

11:17.757 --> 11:18.757
She didn't answer.

11:35.374 --> 11:36.707
How many times do I have to tell you?

11:36.709 --> 11:39.209
Romans 1 explicitly says...

11:39.211 --> 11:42.041
- I know what Romans 1 says, Dad.
- Then what are you doing?

11:42.043 --> 11:44.381
What are you doing
flouting God's holy word?

11:44.383 --> 11:45.549
The Bible also says.

11:45.551 --> 11:47.251
"Judge not lest ye be judged."

11:47.253 --> 11:49.086
Doesn't it?

11:49.088 --> 11:50.354
Yes, it does.

11:50.356 --> 11:53.457
And "God is love." It says that too.

11:53.459 --> 11:56.093
- Yes, it says that as well.
- Who's side are you on here?

11:56.095 --> 11:58.062
Look, I'm not on anybody's side.

11:58.064 --> 12:00.376
Well, you should get on the side of God.

12:00.378 --> 12:02.366
At least, 'cause
that's where I'm capped.

12:02.368 --> 12:04.504
Don't you laugh at me.

12:05.017 --> 12:08.205
Aaron, what's really more important

12:08.207 --> 12:10.606
than quoting Bible verse
after Bible verse

12:10.640 --> 12:12.048
is the fact that...

12:12.742 --> 12:14.742
your father cares enough
about this relationship

12:14.744 --> 12:16.177
that he asked me to bring you here

12:16.179 --> 12:17.645
so we could work this out.

12:17.647 --> 12:18.979
But there's no working this out

12:18.981 --> 12:21.682
unless he accepts me
for the way that I am.

12:23.586 --> 12:25.986
The way that you are is unacceptable!

12:25.988 --> 12:27.442
- Lionel.
- To who?

12:27.990 --> 12:29.065
You?

12:30.193 --> 12:32.026
Do you not love me at all?

12:33.556 --> 12:35.056
Yes, I love you.

12:35.081 --> 12:37.014
Or I'd leave you in this mess of a life

12:37.039 --> 12:38.105
you're making for yourself

12:38.130 --> 12:39.253
and just walk away.

12:39.677 --> 12:42.711
We are here because I love you.

12:46.684 --> 12:48.877
Why don't we take five?

12:49.453 --> 12:50.853
Okay?

12:50.855 --> 12:52.172
Great.

12:55.157 --> 12:56.523
You know, I was hoping
you'd be in my corner

12:56.525 --> 12:58.191
a little bit more, James.

12:58.193 --> 12:59.470
Look...

13:00.362 --> 13:01.561
Lionel, you're behaving just like

13:01.563 --> 13:03.558
the boy always thought you would.

13:04.299 --> 13:05.977
No wonder he kept it a secret.

13:06.469 --> 13:08.101
Who would choose this?

13:12.942 --> 13:15.008
You guys already know what you're doing,

13:15.010 --> 13:17.911
so I figure, if it ain't
broke, don't fix it.

13:18.489 --> 13:20.080
There is one thing

13:20.082 --> 13:22.516
I do want to sprinkle in
to start, though,

13:22.518 --> 13:25.786
and that is when Kerissa and
I were doing Real Church,

13:25.788 --> 13:28.268
we met some amazing people.

13:28.269 --> 13:31.303
And we need them here at Triumph.

13:31.305 --> 13:33.338
Not because I say so,

13:33.340 --> 13:34.940
but because that's how
Jesus would do it.

13:36.210 --> 13:38.410
- Amen?
- Amen.

13:38.412 --> 13:42.081
See if you can get some piano
movers out to the mansion.

13:42.083 --> 13:44.149
- Yes, ma'am.
- I want the girls to have space

13:44.151 --> 13:45.818
to practice their dancing,

13:45.820 --> 13:47.553
but I'm worried
we could break another leg

13:47.555 --> 13:49.621
on that old grand
if we move it ourselves.

13:49.623 --> 13:53.070
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yeah, and file that away for me.

13:53.071 --> 13:54.214
- Okay?
- Okay.

13:54.216 --> 13:55.482
Hey.

13:55.484 --> 13:58.029
Hey, I was coming to hunt you down.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.889
- How's it going?
- Not well.

14:01.891 --> 14:03.457
Come over.

14:03.459 --> 14:04.825
And Lionel's more than a little

14:04.827 --> 14:06.663
disappointed in me for it.

14:07.376 --> 14:08.909
Well...

14:11.331 --> 14:14.031
If Aaron isn't going to listen to reason

14:14.033 --> 14:17.715
- from two upstanding Christians...
- Well, that's the thing, Mae.

14:19.411 --> 14:21.072
My idea of reason on this

14:21.074 --> 14:23.927
and Lionel's are a little bit different.

14:23.928 --> 14:25.628
You don't condone Aaron's behavior.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.563
I'm not sure this is mine to condone

14:27.565 --> 14:29.131
or not condone.

14:29.133 --> 14:31.334
I mean, he's Lionel's son.

14:31.336 --> 14:33.102
And practically family.

14:33.104 --> 14:35.238
And he drove Kevin from our house

14:35.240 --> 14:37.340
in a cloud of shame and confusion.

14:37.342 --> 14:39.342
I mean, honestly, the boy is not Moses.

14:39.344 --> 14:41.077
And Lionel's no Jesus.

14:41.079 --> 14:42.648
Believe me, if Jacob were gay,

14:42.649 --> 14:45.149
we would handle this a lot
differently than he has.

14:45.151 --> 14:47.051
I mean, the boy is not gonna change.

14:47.053 --> 14:50.054
Then it is Lionel
who deserves your sympathy

14:50.056 --> 14:51.958
and not Aaron.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.026
I mean, he's not your child.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.629
He's not Faith.

14:59.198 --> 15:00.965
I'm sorry.

15:02.570 --> 15:05.037
You know, I think what I should do

15:05.039 --> 15:07.846
is go to Charity and catch
her up on all of this

15:07.848 --> 15:09.008
before someone else does.

15:09.010 --> 15:10.843
Yeah.

15:10.845 --> 15:12.544
James?

15:15.195 --> 15:16.999
Come.

15:17.711 --> 15:18.844
Thanks.

15:47.998 --> 15:49.732
Pastor Greenleaf?

15:49.734 --> 15:51.309
Yeah, hey.

15:52.737 --> 15:54.670
So, you think that meeting went well?

15:54.672 --> 15:56.839
Better than okay. Brilliant.

15:57.190 --> 15:59.375
Thanks. It felt good.

15:59.377 --> 16:01.744
- I just want to caution you.
- Please.

16:01.746 --> 16:03.679
Not everyone knows
the financial situation

16:03.681 --> 16:04.947
here the way we do.

16:04.949 --> 16:06.582
Probably for the best.

16:06.584 --> 16:09.685
- Or how it came to be.
- What's your point?

16:09.687 --> 16:11.754
It may be better to wait
on your Real Church

16:11.756 --> 16:13.088
integration a year or two.

16:13.090 --> 16:14.714
Not everyone might see us spending money

16:14.715 --> 16:15.948
on a new program

16:15.950 --> 16:17.020
when we haven't even... you know.

16:17.021 --> 16:18.888
It'll just be a few shuttles.

16:18.890 --> 16:20.590
Just start slow.

16:20.592 --> 16:23.326
My advice, take it or leave it.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.733
- I'll take it...
- Thank you.

16:29.735 --> 16:31.635
Under consideration.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.004
It's all I expect.

16:37.743 --> 16:39.209
That's perfect.

16:39.211 --> 16:42.579
If she's babysat
professionally, then I'm in.

16:42.581 --> 16:44.548
Thank you.

16:44.550 --> 16:46.517
Okay, bye.

16:46.519 --> 16:48.151
Come in.

16:48.153 --> 16:49.887
Is it a bad time?

16:54.156 --> 16:55.665
How can I help you?

16:57.592 --> 17:00.360
Isn't that how you used to
start your conversations

17:00.362 --> 17:01.879
when you were working here?

17:02.278 --> 17:05.244
And living at our house?

17:05.247 --> 17:08.182
And representing me in my divorce?

17:10.486 --> 17:13.252
How can I help you?

17:16.392 --> 17:18.192
I just wanted to say that I'm sorry.

17:18.194 --> 17:19.292
For what?

17:19.646 --> 17:21.428
Can you even say it?

17:23.398 --> 17:24.734
I couldn't.

17:25.267 --> 17:26.567
For being a part of something

17:26.569 --> 17:29.115
that has made so many people unhappy.

17:29.853 --> 17:30.918
Including Kevin.

17:30.920 --> 17:33.453
Kevin should be unhappy.

17:33.990 --> 17:36.581
And I'm only talking about one thing.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.566
One thing.

17:41.214 --> 17:42.795
His son.

17:43.382 --> 17:46.383
He left his son without a father.

17:46.385 --> 17:49.820
- And I think he feels...
- I don't care how he feels!

17:50.136 --> 17:53.657
All I care about is keeping this world

17:53.659 --> 17:56.427
in one piece for my son.

17:58.408 --> 17:59.408
And for myself.

18:02.645 --> 18:05.153
You know, if this whole
thing were turned around

18:05.178 --> 18:07.145
and I was a lesbian...

18:08.916 --> 18:10.783
I would still be a mother.

18:13.754 --> 18:17.179
The thing is he's ashamed.

18:17.314 --> 18:19.047
And every day that he stays away,

18:19.049 --> 18:20.348
he just feels...

18:20.350 --> 18:23.084
I said I don't care how he feels!

18:24.388 --> 18:26.688
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:27.057 --> 18:28.857
I got work to do.

18:32.669 --> 18:34.869
Okay. Yeah.

18:40.378 --> 18:42.478
Do you want me to
come and stay with you?

18:42.480 --> 18:44.847
Thank you for the offer, but no.

18:44.849 --> 18:46.780
Well, look, whatever
we can do, you just let us know.

18:46.782 --> 18:49.742
- We're here for you.
- And I appreciate you ladies so much.

18:49.744 --> 18:51.723
- So, thank you. I really do.
- Girl.

18:51.724 --> 18:54.158
- Pardon.
- Hey.

18:54.160 --> 18:57.061
- Can I just have a sec?
- We're sorry.

18:57.063 --> 18:59.197
We'll leave the two of you and
let you do your business.

18:59.199 --> 19:01.766
- You take care of yourself now, okay?
- I will, I will.

19:01.768 --> 19:04.035
- Thank you, ladies. Thank you.
- No problem.

19:09.049 --> 19:11.651
So, how you holding up?

19:11.676 --> 19:13.509
Well, you know, you know.

19:13.534 --> 19:14.645
Doing all right.

19:14.670 --> 19:17.404
It's nice to come
to work and see friends.

19:17.429 --> 19:19.196
I just feel like all I do now

19:19.221 --> 19:20.853
was walk around the condo all day

19:20.878 --> 19:24.021
and then circle back
around to Basie's shoes.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.082
He only took one pair of shoes.

19:27.107 --> 19:29.441
- My goodness.
- Yeah.

19:29.466 --> 19:33.368
Well, listen, Jacob and I want you to
come to dinner at the parsonage tonight.

19:33.393 --> 19:37.428
Really? Kerissa, that
would mean everything to me.

19:37.453 --> 19:38.687
You know y'all are the only ones

19:38.711 --> 19:40.577
I have to talk to about all this mess,

19:40.602 --> 19:41.817
- and it's just...
- Well, then, it's a date.

19:41.818 --> 19:43.784
- 7:00 p.m.
- Perfect, thank you.

19:43.809 --> 19:44.975
Excuse me, First Lady?

19:45.000 --> 19:46.261
Yes?

19:46.286 --> 19:48.278
I meant First Lady Skanks.

19:48.911 --> 19:50.715
Of course.

19:51.824 --> 19:53.056
- I'll see you tonight.
- Yes.

19:53.058 --> 19:54.524
And what shall I bring?

19:54.526 --> 19:55.826
Well, just your beautiful self.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.264
All right, I'll see you later.

19:59.097 --> 20:00.497
I can't "unknow" what I know,

20:00.499 --> 20:03.099
I can't "unfeel" what I feel.

20:03.101 --> 20:05.969
Love me the way I am.

20:06.258 --> 20:07.657
I do.

20:08.006 --> 20:09.039
Well, then trust me.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.248
Listen.

20:10.249 --> 20:12.349
Why can't you just try to change?

20:12.351 --> 20:15.197
Because I know that I can't!

20:15.888 --> 20:17.488
Because I've tried

20:17.490 --> 20:21.912
and tried and prayed
and prayed for years.

20:23.951 --> 20:25.333
It just is.

20:26.621 --> 20:28.087
It's just me.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.625
This is crazy.

20:32.627 --> 20:34.226
I'm just gonna leave.

20:34.228 --> 20:35.929
Go ahead, walk away.

20:35.954 --> 20:37.153
Blame me.

20:37.178 --> 20:39.112
I'm the bad guy here.

20:41.509 --> 20:43.112
I love you, Dad.

20:45.072 --> 20:48.918
- Goodbye.
- Aaron, wait. Just hold on.

20:48.943 --> 20:50.977
I think I found the one good thing

20:51.002 --> 20:53.233
about your mother leaving
us the way she did.

20:54.515 --> 20:57.490
- She didn't have to know what her son...
- She knew.

20:58.119 --> 20:59.687
She didn't know.

20:59.712 --> 21:01.818
Yes, Dad, she did.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.163
That's impossible.

21:03.188 --> 21:04.721
She knew. I told her.

21:04.965 --> 21:07.458
- When?
- When I was 13.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.284
And she told me not to tell you

21:09.309 --> 21:10.843
because you'd never
be able to handle it.

21:10.867 --> 21:12.233
That's a lie!

21:12.258 --> 21:13.912
No, it's not.

21:14.189 --> 21:15.937
It's the truth.

21:17.206 --> 21:19.373
And she knew about you, too.

21:19.375 --> 21:21.141
All of 'em.

21:21.143 --> 21:22.409
What are you talking about?

21:22.411 --> 21:24.712
Just because you did it with women,

21:24.714 --> 21:27.181
doesn't mean it wasn't sin.

21:29.261 --> 21:31.151
I don't know what he's
talking about, I don't!

21:31.153 --> 21:32.653
Honestly.

21:32.655 --> 21:36.056
I'll make my way back to Montgomery.

21:36.758 --> 21:38.258
Thanks for trying.

21:43.535 --> 21:45.538
This is crazy.

21:46.538 --> 21:47.804
What's crazy, Lionel?

21:47.806 --> 21:50.007
Crazy how a perverted mind

21:50.009 --> 21:53.944
can perceive perversions
where it can't be found.

21:55.447 --> 21:56.924
Yes, it is.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.283
It's crazy.

22:01.954 --> 22:02.986
I'm gonna go back to the house.

22:02.988 --> 22:04.588
I'll see you there.

22:08.794 --> 22:12.029
Let's go, ladies.

22:12.031 --> 22:13.930
- Beautiful.
- I should've been the DJ.

22:13.932 --> 22:16.066
You can't waltz to gospel trap.

22:16.068 --> 22:18.669
It's trap gospel.

22:18.671 --> 22:19.831
Look.

22:19.832 --> 22:21.064
Okay.

22:28.273 --> 22:30.574
Wait, look at Suzette.

22:30.576 --> 22:33.310
She basically begged Sam to be here.

22:33.312 --> 22:36.146
- Like, stalked him.
- All right, you two.

22:36.148 --> 22:37.547
Wait, how do you know that?

22:38.392 --> 22:40.350
Somebody told me.

22:41.415 --> 22:43.348
Where's Isaiah?

22:43.350 --> 22:46.852
I see with the relevant
questions, but I don't know.

22:47.683 --> 22:49.555
Well, rehearsal's about to start.

22:49.557 --> 22:51.190
- I know.
- Well, I'm sure we can find

22:51.192 --> 22:52.772
a spare dude around here somewhere.

22:53.961 --> 22:55.327
Found one.

22:56.964 --> 22:59.565
- Hey. Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.
- Yeah, I know.

22:59.567 --> 23:00.988
Babe, come on.

23:01.802 --> 23:03.502
Fix your face, cousin.

23:05.226 --> 23:06.625
What? I said I'm sorry.

23:07.703 --> 23:12.611
You know, it isn't sunny in here, so...

23:14.235 --> 23:15.735
Babe, you know how people get.

23:15.737 --> 23:17.436
Okay? I don't want
no one making a big deal

23:17.438 --> 23:20.424
out of me being here when I'm
just trying to support my girl.

23:22.683 --> 23:24.550
There. Happy?

23:24.575 --> 23:26.575
Yeah.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.416
Did Patrice ever say anything to you

23:30.418 --> 23:33.486
about Aaron being gay?

23:33.488 --> 23:37.890
No! If she did, I never
would've put him down the hall

23:37.892 --> 23:39.026
next to Kevin.

23:40.006 --> 23:42.140
What about Lionel and other women?

23:44.110 --> 23:45.676
Why are you asking me that?

23:45.678 --> 23:48.157
Right before he stormed out of the room,

23:48.509 --> 23:50.776
Aaron said something
that seemed to imply that...

23:50.778 --> 23:54.183
What? Implied what?

23:54.982 --> 23:57.482
Well, that Patrice knew all about

23:57.618 --> 24:00.886
Lionel and other women he'd been with.

24:02.576 --> 24:04.676
Women, plural?

24:06.841 --> 24:08.507
That's what it sounded like.

24:11.538 --> 24:12.583
No.

24:13.493 --> 24:15.805
She never said anything like that to me.

24:15.844 --> 24:18.812
Not ever, and she told me everything.

24:18.814 --> 24:20.568
If you ask me,

24:21.569 --> 24:23.101
that boy is just making up stories

24:23.103 --> 24:25.671
to deflect attention from himself.

24:25.673 --> 24:27.616
Well, that's what I thought, too.

24:28.402 --> 24:30.969
Look. There.

24:30.997 --> 24:32.097
Stunning.

24:35.516 --> 24:37.850
One, two, three, four, five, six.

24:39.954 --> 24:41.587
No spaghetti arms!

24:43.030 --> 24:44.629
Heads up!

24:48.412 --> 24:49.678
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:49.680 --> 24:51.246
- Whoa, whoa.
- Okay.

24:51.248 --> 24:53.482
Look at Suzette and Sam.

24:53.484 --> 24:56.685
I can't, it hurts too much.
Okay, here comes the spin.

24:56.687 --> 24:58.453
Let's both do our own thing
then come back together.

24:58.455 --> 24:59.748
Okay.

25:04.795 --> 25:06.361
Young man, what are you doing?

25:06.363 --> 25:08.239
- Sorry, my bad.
- Back in line.

25:08.264 --> 25:09.783
From the top.

25:10.723 --> 25:13.370
One, two, three, four, five, six.

25:14.577 --> 25:16.794
Britney? She's the duchess.

25:16.796 --> 25:18.696
"Duchess"?

25:18.698 --> 25:20.931
Yeah, that's what
Basie used to call her.

25:20.933 --> 25:23.200
He would say she's the Duchess Prime.

25:24.404 --> 25:26.270
She may have a point, though.

25:26.272 --> 25:28.072
The only point she has
is a decimal point,

25:28.074 --> 25:29.974
and even that's a fake.

25:29.976 --> 25:33.210
She just likes having things her
own way and that's all it is.

25:33.212 --> 25:37.214
Now, I don't know what she has
against the homeless, though.

25:37.216 --> 25:38.983
I mean, maybe she thinks they smell

25:38.985 --> 25:40.785
or she thinks one of them

25:40.787 --> 25:42.153
gonna steal one
of her pumps or something,

25:42.155 --> 25:43.431
I don't know.

25:43.432 --> 25:44.898
Satan has his ways.

25:44.900 --> 25:48.402
It is possible that
she might be right, though.

25:48.404 --> 25:49.703
Baby, how can it be right

25:49.705 --> 25:51.538
not to make an effort
to include the homeless?

25:51.540 --> 25:52.973
I'm not saying not to make an effort,

25:52.975 --> 25:54.662
I'm saying just wait.

25:55.351 --> 25:56.551
It's your first day.

25:56.553 --> 25:57.819
Well, I mean, I can say something

25:57.821 --> 25:58.820
to her if you want.

25:58.822 --> 26:00.221
No, it's fine.

26:00.223 --> 26:01.689
- We'll handle it.
- You sure?

26:01.691 --> 26:03.491
Because I don't mind
taking a chair in there

26:03.493 --> 26:04.692
and taming that thing.

26:04.694 --> 26:06.215
No, we've got it, thank you.

26:07.597 --> 26:09.363
Okay.

26:18.388 --> 26:20.188
- I'm sorry, Tasha.
- No, it...

26:20.190 --> 26:22.323
it's not that, I...

26:24.360 --> 26:26.193
it's just that I...

26:28.097 --> 26:30.331
I hope that he's safe out there.

26:32.676 --> 26:35.910
I just really miss him.

26:55.192 --> 26:57.192
- Here we go.
- Wow!

26:57.194 --> 26:59.294
- Yeah.
- Where did you learn to cook like this?

26:59.296 --> 27:01.286
I just followed the recipe.

27:01.806 --> 27:03.108
- Wow.
- I had this once

27:03.133 --> 27:04.507
in Del Posto in New York.

27:04.509 --> 27:06.041
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

27:06.043 --> 27:07.410
You should try the salad. It's fresh.

27:07.412 --> 27:08.600
- Okay.
- Yeah.

27:09.787 --> 27:11.721
- Nice.
- Yes.

27:11.783 --> 27:13.799
Can I ask you a weird question?

27:14.552 --> 27:16.733
That is a weird question.

27:17.638 --> 27:19.471
I guess.

27:19.992 --> 27:22.192
Where do you see yourself
in, like, five years?

27:22.217 --> 27:23.917
Paint me a picture.

27:24.349 --> 27:25.415
Okay.

27:25.440 --> 27:26.770
Um...

27:27.780 --> 27:30.447
in a house with a little more land.

27:30.449 --> 27:32.282
- Okay.
- Yeah.

27:32.284 --> 27:34.851
I'd like to have written a book.

27:34.853 --> 27:36.553
- Really?
- Yeah.

27:36.555 --> 27:38.088
What about?

27:38.090 --> 27:40.123
Maybe my time in Afghanistan.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.938
I have a box at the office
just full of ideas.

27:45.624 --> 27:46.957
Yeah.

27:46.982 --> 27:48.234
Other than that,

27:49.240 --> 27:50.306
I don't know.

27:53.325 --> 27:54.857
Kids?

27:57.089 --> 27:58.255
Nah.

27:58.257 --> 28:00.662
Ooh, are you sure about that?

28:01.307 --> 28:02.906
Well, it's kind of late to start.

28:03.195 --> 28:04.500
Why?

28:05.190 --> 28:06.857
Are you thinking
you want to have another?

28:07.233 --> 28:08.932
No.

28:08.934 --> 28:11.227
Just... I was wondering
if you were, that's all.

28:11.228 --> 28:14.462
Yeah. I'm good without kids.

28:18.368 --> 28:19.567
Good to know.

28:21.571 --> 28:24.539
If you're willing to let Maricel
go for those two weeks,

28:24.541 --> 28:25.507
I can piece together the rest of it

28:25.509 --> 28:26.966
with Tamela's assistant.

28:26.991 --> 28:29.727
- It's done.
- Wait, Tamela's assistant?

28:30.053 --> 28:31.752
Yeah, she's certified in baby CPR

28:31.754 --> 28:33.054
and she's babysat professionally, so.

28:33.056 --> 28:35.089
You said nobody but Maricel would do.

28:35.091 --> 28:36.290
Isn't that what you said?

28:36.292 --> 28:37.958
Yes, Mama, but it is what it is.

28:37.960 --> 28:39.460
I'm just trying to make it work.

28:39.462 --> 28:41.453
And who'll lead worship
while you're gone?

28:41.784 --> 28:43.250
Tamela's assistant?

28:43.366 --> 28:45.332
Is she a certified exalter, too?

28:45.694 --> 28:48.695
Okay, Mama. Carlton is available.

28:48.720 --> 28:51.221
You see? That is what I'm talking about.

28:51.441 --> 28:52.364
What?

28:52.389 --> 28:54.098
The pickle Kevin's left you in.

28:54.123 --> 28:56.156
Look, I don't want Kevin's help.

28:56.181 --> 28:59.082
No, of course, Tamela Mann's
assistant has you covered.

28:59.107 --> 29:01.325
I mean, you know, who needs a father?

29:01.350 --> 29:03.699
Charity, I want to apologize

29:03.724 --> 29:05.185
for Aaron's role in all of this.

29:05.589 --> 29:08.427
He's lost sight of God's law completely.

29:08.452 --> 29:11.253
- Which one?
- Excuse me?

29:11.300 --> 29:13.200
Which one of God's laws

29:13.225 --> 29:15.458
are you referring to specifically?

29:16.977 --> 29:20.738
Prohibitions against
homosexuality, Romans 1.

29:20.739 --> 29:22.552
But the Commandments are the laws.

29:23.055 --> 29:25.255
Aren't they more primary to the faith?

29:25.477 --> 29:28.181
I mean, "Thou shalt not steal",

29:28.206 --> 29:30.372
kill, commit adultery."

29:30.397 --> 29:32.965
- Mae.
- Listen, I'm as put off

29:32.990 --> 29:35.090
by the equivocations
of these homosexuals

29:35.115 --> 29:36.214
as anyone else.

29:36.239 --> 29:38.274
But there is no law.

29:38.299 --> 29:40.679
Mae, let it go.

29:41.352 --> 29:42.985
I think there's something going on here

29:43.010 --> 29:44.641
that I don't quite understand.

29:44.666 --> 29:46.298
You and I both.

29:46.731 --> 29:49.218
It's my life, Mama.

29:49.243 --> 29:50.451
Okay?

29:50.723 --> 29:52.055
I know it's your life, darling.

29:52.697 --> 29:55.411
But I do not want to see you

29:55.412 --> 29:57.218
throw away your dignity

29:57.243 --> 29:59.581
running after this Jabari character

29:59.606 --> 30:00.806
trying to get love from him

30:00.831 --> 30:01.864
while your son is sleeping

30:01.888 --> 30:02.887
in a pimpedout bus.

30:02.912 --> 30:03.912
Mama!

30:04.210 --> 30:06.110
I would never do that.

30:06.705 --> 30:11.418
A woman has a unique Godgiven ability

30:11.717 --> 30:14.451
to express and experience love.

30:14.453 --> 30:16.487
But the downside to that is it puts you

30:16.489 --> 30:18.689
in a very vulnerable position.

30:19.134 --> 30:20.624
I'll be fine.

30:20.626 --> 30:23.560
I just don't want to see you

30:23.562 --> 30:25.796
lose your selfrespect over some man

30:25.798 --> 30:28.352
because no man

30:29.033 --> 30:30.533
is worth that.

30:31.371 --> 30:32.836
Amen.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.765
I think I'll just have more wine.

30:35.790 --> 30:38.791
I've lost my appetite. Maricel!

30:39.117 --> 30:40.618
You guys look like you were trying out

30:40.642 --> 30:42.275
for So You Think You Can Dance

30:42.300 --> 30:43.742
or something out there.

30:43.767 --> 30:45.100
- Jealous?
- Of what?

30:45.125 --> 30:46.891
Those discontinued
Michael Jackson spins?

30:46.916 --> 30:48.549
- Not too much.
- Haha.

30:49.221 --> 30:51.288
Is that his fan club?

30:51.290 --> 30:53.264
Thank you.

30:53.289 --> 30:56.290
I mean, he should be over here with you.

30:56.315 --> 30:59.925
It's cool. It's part of
being superstar adjacent.

31:01.127 --> 31:02.177
What?

31:03.937 --> 31:05.472
Nice moves.

31:07.099 --> 31:08.331
You talking to me?

31:08.480 --> 31:10.185
No, the cookie.

31:10.210 --> 31:11.609
Funny.

31:12.477 --> 31:15.175
The guy is the frame
and the lady is the picture,

31:15.200 --> 31:16.954
but since you got it backwards,

31:16.982 --> 31:19.650
I just wanted to make sure
you were in the right place.

31:19.675 --> 31:22.666
See? See, I can't make one move

31:22.691 --> 31:24.458
without this one shading me.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.116
I just think you should calm down

31:26.141 --> 31:28.208
on the groupies at the
cotillion, that's all.

31:28.233 --> 31:29.866
What, you defending her now?

31:29.891 --> 31:30.886
Again? Seriously?

31:30.899 --> 31:32.299
- I just think it's really...
- Babe.

31:32.301 --> 31:35.402
Remarkable how everything
is always about you.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.404
Three against one?

31:37.406 --> 31:39.267
Okay, I see.

31:39.602 --> 31:42.537
This some ish right here. I'm out!

31:50.880 --> 31:53.914
Zora.

31:59.995 --> 32:01.495
You okay?

32:05.783 --> 32:07.884
- Isaiah. Isaiah.
- I don't know why you have to

32:07.886 --> 32:09.852
choose her over me every single time.

32:09.854 --> 32:12.855
Isaiah, no, no, no.
I'm not on anyone's side.

32:12.857 --> 32:15.158
I just don't wanna have to deal
with everything that's going on...

32:15.160 --> 32:16.459
So now I'm something to deal with?

32:16.461 --> 32:18.227
- No. No, no, no.
- I bailed on Floodgate

32:18.229 --> 32:19.497
to come tap dance with you!

32:19.522 --> 32:20.543
- I know. I know.
- And I'm the one

32:20.567 --> 32:21.607
that has to be dealt with?

32:21.633 --> 32:23.188
What about her, Z?

32:24.871 --> 32:26.571
You smashing her or me?

32:27.471 --> 32:29.537
Please, come on.

32:29.562 --> 32:31.304
- Please.
- Get off of me!

32:32.170 --> 32:33.503
I'm with you. I'm with you.

32:33.528 --> 32:35.456
- I said get off!
- Isaiah.

32:39.886 --> 32:41.886
Baby? Z?

32:41.911 --> 32:43.544
- Z? Z? Baby, baby.
- No, no, no.

32:43.569 --> 32:44.902
- Baby, baby, baby.
- Don't touch me!

32:44.926 --> 32:47.060
Why me? Why would you
do that to me, Isaiah?

32:47.085 --> 32:48.884
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

32:48.909 --> 32:51.464
I'm sorry. Hey. I didn't mean to.

32:51.489 --> 32:52.921
Okay?

32:53.264 --> 32:56.583
Look, it's just...

32:56.722 --> 32:59.389
it's just when you judge me like that,

32:59.414 --> 33:01.614
I just feel like I'm gonna
lose you or something.

33:01.639 --> 33:03.072
Okay?

33:03.875 --> 33:06.475
Look, I don't wanna lose you, Zora.

33:07.492 --> 33:08.791
You're the best thing

33:08.819 --> 33:10.586
that's ever happened to me, baby.

33:10.611 --> 33:12.891
- Really?
- Yes.

33:14.105 --> 33:15.671
Even more than music.

33:18.576 --> 33:19.942
I promise you,

33:19.967 --> 33:22.484
I will never do this again.

33:22.509 --> 33:27.406
Okay? I just wild out and I get crazy.

33:28.094 --> 33:30.450
And I can't control myself, because...

33:31.864 --> 33:33.495
because I love you.

33:34.300 --> 33:36.901
- It's okay, it's okay.
- I love you.

33:36.903 --> 33:39.003
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

33:50.803 --> 33:52.347
You still up?

33:53.586 --> 33:54.585
If you think I could sleep

33:54.587 --> 33:56.020
after what I heard today,

33:56.022 --> 33:57.310
you must be crazy.

33:58.518 --> 34:00.551
Did James repeat Aaron's foolishness?

34:00.576 --> 34:02.910
Is that what all this drama
at dinner was about?

34:02.935 --> 34:04.359
Were there other women?

34:05.591 --> 34:07.958
The boy is grasping at straws.

34:07.983 --> 34:10.050
Were there other women?
Come on, just tell me.

34:10.074 --> 34:11.283
Were there?

34:12.871 --> 34:16.806
There's no one, no one
as important to me as you.

34:17.176 --> 34:20.311
None who touched me so deeply.

34:23.021 --> 34:25.005
Negro, please.

34:26.379 --> 34:29.447
I could've ended my marriage,

34:29.472 --> 34:31.338
shamed my family,

34:31.362 --> 34:32.696
all for the things you said.

34:32.721 --> 34:34.588
All for the promises you made.

34:34.612 --> 34:37.280
All of the futures that you painted

34:37.304 --> 34:38.804
in the back of my mind

34:38.829 --> 34:40.529
out of that silver tongue of yours

34:40.554 --> 34:43.889
only to find out that there were others.

34:44.437 --> 34:46.971
Well, I want to know how many.

34:46.973 --> 34:49.139
How many other stupid women

34:49.141 --> 34:50.864
did you tell those
pretty, little lies to?

34:52.292 --> 34:53.824
A few.

34:53.849 --> 34:55.716
You disgust me.

34:56.422 --> 34:58.155
And not like a Christian.

34:58.180 --> 35:00.514
No, no, I won't dare to do like you,

35:00.539 --> 35:03.040
and put myself in a position

35:03.065 --> 35:04.591
to be judging things of the spirit.

35:04.616 --> 35:06.297
But let me tell you something

35:06.322 --> 35:08.256
just talking to you as a woman.

35:09.022 --> 35:10.455
As a man, Lionel,

35:10.480 --> 35:13.748
you are disgusting.

35:13.773 --> 35:15.806
And you are small.

35:15.831 --> 35:20.035
Mae, your brother was a rapist.

35:20.060 --> 35:22.644
- Don't you even start.
- And James is no saint.

35:22.669 --> 35:26.004
- You're on dangerous territory!
- And as far as I know,

35:26.029 --> 35:29.163
it was the sissy
ex soninlaw of yours...

35:29.188 --> 35:31.589
- that turned my Aaron into what he is.
- What you... don't you talk...

35:31.613 --> 35:33.514
So, just close your mouth.

35:35.871 --> 35:39.039
And I'm telling you
right now, don't you ever

35:39.041 --> 35:40.674
show your face around my life again.

35:40.676 --> 35:43.843
- Mae.
- No, because you're not good enough.

35:43.845 --> 35:46.002
You are nothing!

35:46.782 --> 35:48.381
Absolutely nothing.

35:48.383 --> 35:50.817
You don't exist enough to be considered.

35:50.819 --> 35:52.452
You are just...

35:52.454 --> 35:56.304
a space where a person should've been!

35:56.618 --> 35:58.751
You're nothing.

36:07.010 --> 36:08.609
You sure you don't want kids?

36:11.988 --> 36:14.422
Well, why are you asking me that again?

36:14.637 --> 36:17.705
I just... I really think
it's something that people

36:17.730 --> 36:19.077
don't really know.

36:20.368 --> 36:21.413
Grace.

36:23.205 --> 36:24.916
All I want is you.

36:26.809 --> 36:29.276
Now, look, I believe you have that

36:29.301 --> 36:33.837
little thing in your head that makes
everything so super complicated

36:34.090 --> 36:37.000
because it's always been
super complicated,

36:37.025 --> 36:38.093
and it feels like home,

36:38.118 --> 36:41.099
but life can be simpler.

36:42.191 --> 36:44.058
Okay?

36:44.083 --> 36:46.563
Wherever you wanna go, we can go.

36:48.424 --> 36:50.191
Whatever you want to do, we can do it.

36:52.548 --> 36:54.281
You're all I want.

36:58.240 --> 36:59.973
I'm all you want?

37:00.228 --> 37:01.761
Yeah.

37:01.786 --> 37:03.219
You're all I want.

37:16.166 --> 37:17.765
Are you open to moving Tasha?

37:19.502 --> 37:21.102
From where to where?

37:21.104 --> 37:23.104
Well, her office is right
next door to yours.

37:23.106 --> 37:25.018
Shouldn't it be my office?

37:25.909 --> 37:27.475
And there's that nice
big one down the hall

37:27.477 --> 37:29.577
that used to be yours for a hot second.

37:32.389 --> 37:35.390
Keke, can we just...

37:35.415 --> 37:36.613
just hold on.

37:37.921 --> 37:40.488
You think she should stay there
and I should go down the hall?

37:40.490 --> 37:43.958
- Kerissa?
- What?

37:43.960 --> 37:46.961
You're the First Lady of Triumph now.

37:46.963 --> 37:48.796
I know that!

37:48.798 --> 37:50.631
But does Tasha know, do you?

37:50.633 --> 37:52.767
Everybody knows.

37:52.769 --> 37:54.005
Everybody.

37:55.004 --> 37:57.384
So, let's just take it
one step at a time.

38:02.691 --> 38:03.891
What are you doing?

38:06.756 --> 38:08.589
Taking it one step at a time.

38:08.614 --> 38:10.021
That's step one.

38:11.120 --> 38:13.358
This is step two.

38:14.090 --> 38:16.736
- I want her out of that office.
- Whatever.

38:18.228 --> 38:20.595
And that's step three.

38:20.597 --> 38:23.326
The step I've been
thinking about all day.

38:24.067 --> 38:27.268
All through the staff meeting,

38:27.270 --> 38:29.904
all during dinner,

38:29.906 --> 38:32.039
and ever since I walked in this room.

39:28.765 --> 39:30.031
Thank you.

39:30.033 --> 39:31.644
Hey.

39:32.936 --> 39:34.235
Back to Charlotte?

39:34.237 --> 39:36.037
Points unknown.

39:36.039 --> 39:37.838
I'm speaking figuratively.

39:37.840 --> 39:40.241
Who knows where my family is headed.

39:40.243 --> 39:41.876
What's left of it, anyway.

39:41.878 --> 39:44.178
Listen, Mae is not feeling well.

39:44.246 --> 39:45.780
Well, that's a shame.

39:46.169 --> 39:47.635
Lionel?

39:49.218 --> 39:50.918
We're both old men.

39:50.920 --> 39:52.153
Getting older by the minute.

39:52.155 --> 39:54.889
And we both made enough mistakes

39:54.891 --> 39:56.657
that if it wasn't for the blood of Jesus

39:56.659 --> 39:58.326
saving either one of our sorry butts,

39:58.328 --> 40:00.061
it'd be a judgment call.

40:00.063 --> 40:01.423
What are you trying to say, James?

40:02.091 --> 40:03.831
Gay or straight, that boy is the only

40:03.833 --> 40:05.700
blood relation you got left.

40:06.721 --> 40:08.640
He needs you.

40:09.072 --> 40:12.139
And there's gonna come a
day when you'll need him.

40:12.852 --> 40:15.142
I offer this to you as a friend.

40:17.714 --> 40:19.442
I'll keep that in mind, James.

40:21.250 --> 40:23.571
Tell Mae I'm sorry.

40:24.654 --> 40:26.157
About what?

40:26.856 --> 40:29.357
That we didn't get
a chance to say goodbye.

40:32.128 --> 40:34.228
I'll do that.
