WEBVTT

01:49.777 --> 01:52.860
— What's wrong, Mother?
- Ruined.

01:54.282 --> 01:58.150
That idiot has ruined us all!
We shall have to leave Rome!

01:58.286 --> 02:00.823
Caesar has crossed the Rubicon.

02:00.955 --> 02:04.994
He's on Italian soil under arms.
It's an act of gross treason.

02:05.126 --> 02:07.333
With a single legion, if you please.

02:07.461 --> 02:11.625
So not merely treason but suicidal treason.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.126
Will that be all, domina?

02:17.888 --> 02:21.597
— Have you heard?
- Strange.

02:21.726 --> 02:25.685
A foolish thing to do. One legion.

02:25.813 --> 02:28.350
I wonder what he's thinking.

02:28.482 --> 02:32.441
I remember back when l destroyed
the lllyrian pirates,

02:32.570 --> 02:37.109
there was one particular old sea snake,
a Liburnian, if I recall.

02:37.241 --> 02:40.529
Never mind the lllyrian pirates.
What is to be done?

02:40.661 --> 02:44.074
I've already given word.
My legions are gathering.

02:44.206 --> 02:45.821
And you'll crush him?

02:45.958 --> 02:48.620
Without question. The poor man is dead.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.500
Take our Ubian cavalry

02:53.632 --> 02:57.090
and scout all roads
and defensive strongpoints up to the city.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.755
Advance until resistance is met.

02:58.888 --> 03:03.928
If and when civilians are encountered,
deliver the enclosed proclamation.

03:04.060 --> 03:07.097
If you encounter no resistance,
go directly to the Forum

03:07.229 --> 03:09.481
and nail it to the Senate door.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.434
Sir.

03:11.567 --> 03:14.525
There will be no rapine, pillage or burning.

03:15.613 --> 03:18.821
— Any questions?
- None, sir.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.610
That'll be all.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.454
What makes your man Vorenus so morose?

03:30.586 --> 03:32.372
He is a stonewall Catonian.

03:32.505 --> 03:36.339
Thinks we've committed a terrible crime,
a mighty sacrilege

03:36.467 --> 03:38.924
and shall be severely punished by the gods.

03:39.053 --> 03:43.137
- He may be right.
— It's a crime if we lose. If we win, it isn't.

03:43.265 --> 03:46.757
— I am merely pursuing my legitimate rights.
— Of course.

03:46.894 --> 03:49.135
— Do you think we can trust him?
— Who?

03:49.271 --> 03:51.136
Lucius Vorenus.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.848
Deep 13th, him.

03:53.984 --> 03:56.691
He'd follow the eagle up Pluto's arse.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.375
I told you not to come here.

04:25.266 --> 04:26.972
I had to see my son.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.387
You've seen him. Now, go.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.191
And stay away.

04:39.780 --> 04:42.317
Help me, Niobe.

04:42.450 --> 04:46.318
I'm going insane. You can't forsake me.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.241
- I do.
— I won't give up. Don't think I will.

04:49.373 --> 04:52.080
You loved me once, you will love me again.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.292
I never loved you.

04:55.421 --> 04:57.787
Lie to yourself if you want but don't lie to me.

04:57.923 --> 04:59.333
Stay away.

04:59.467 --> 05:03.210
You know you will never see
your husband now, you know that, eh?

05:03.345 --> 05:05.336
Him and all the rest of them are doomed.

05:05.473 --> 05:07.839
You don't know that.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.057
Everybody knows that.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.727
That may be but I made a vow.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.264
Go.

05:21.906 --> 05:24.648
I swear to Dis, if you don't go...

05:28.454 --> 05:31.821
It's all right. He's going. Just go.

05:35.294 --> 05:39.378
— You promised never to see him again.
- I didn't want him here. I told him to go.

05:39.507 --> 05:41.543
It didn't look like that.

05:45.304 --> 05:49.547
You could tell Papa the truth.
It's not your fault. If you and I spoke to him...

05:49.683 --> 05:51.264
Never. You have sworn.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.600
You thought he was dead. He'll understand.

05:53.729 --> 05:56.471
He will kill us all.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.688
Try it again!

06:09.203 --> 06:14.163
You...you often say
that you are adept with women.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.827
No idle boast neither.

06:15.960 --> 06:18.747
Girls from Narbo to Thebes
scream my name by night.

06:18.879 --> 06:24.340
l have no need of your coital expertise.
My question concerns their...affections.

06:25.386 --> 06:28.128
I'm your man for that, to boot.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.388
My wife, she...

06:34.353 --> 06:36.890
You heard what she said, she hates me.

06:38.274 --> 06:41.437
- What's your question?
— How do I stop her hating me, obviously?

06:41.569 --> 06:45.528
It's not obvious. I thought you were
making her hate you with a purpose.

06:45.656 --> 06:47.738
That was not my intent. Why do that?

06:47.866 --> 06:52.451
I don't know. You're the clever one.
There might have been a thousand reasons.

06:52.580 --> 06:56.619
I love her. I require that she love me also,
else I am merely her slave

06:56.750 --> 06:58.786
and I cannot tolerate that.

07:01.130 --> 07:03.872
What care you what she feels
if we're all going to die?

07:04.008 --> 07:07.466
And so we are but who will honour
my name when I am gone?

07:07.595 --> 07:10.211
Who will pay Proserpina
and Pluto for my keep?

07:10.347 --> 07:12.929
Who will pour wine upon my grave?

07:13.058 --> 07:17.643
If it comes to that, I shall do the honours.
It's the least I could do.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.636
Thank you.

07:20.608 --> 07:22.348
But it's not the same thing.

07:22.484 --> 07:25.612
Besides...you'll be dead too.

07:33.746 --> 07:37.238
I'm planning a small party
this evening and I'll need you to...

07:38.542 --> 07:41.249
Are you wearing perfume?

07:41.378 --> 07:43.084
Just a dab.

07:43.964 --> 07:48.003
lt's horrid. Horseshit suits you much better.

07:48.135 --> 07:50.501
I need you to get more men
to stand guard outside

07:50.638 --> 07:52.674
to greet my guests when they arrive.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.422
A party? Is that wise, given how things are?

07:55.559 --> 07:57.720
Perfume, advice...whatever next?

07:57.853 --> 08:00.811
I'm just saying Pompey's mob is out for blood.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.850
— It's best to lay low.
- Lay low?

08:02.983 --> 08:05.599
I'm not a lizard. lwill not be intimidated.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.193
As you like. Cost you extra though.

08:08.322 --> 08:11.530
You've been paid quite adequately already.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.900
More men COSt more.

08:16.163 --> 08:19.576
— I will tell Castor to speak with you.
— I don't want more money.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.994
Well, what do you want, then?

08:23.170 --> 08:25.206
You know what I want.

08:28.801 --> 08:31.133
— Something like that.
— You forget your place.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.252
My place is with my family.

08:33.389 --> 08:35.596
Say the word and I'll go to them.

08:41.313 --> 08:44.055
Do your job to my satisfaction and...

08:45.901 --> 08:48.688
I'll see that you're properly rewarded.

08:52.908 --> 08:55.024
Thank you, domina.

09:08.507 --> 09:12.841
Pompey's outriders.
His legions won't be far behind.

09:12.970 --> 09:16.178
Us and the rest of the 13th
will be on crosses by market day.

09:16.306 --> 09:19.844
Thank the gods my father didn't
live to see his son die a traitor.

09:19.977 --> 09:23.765
— Best to die now then? Come on.
- Wait! We're not here to fight.

09:23.897 --> 09:26.013
"Advance until resistance is met."

09:26.150 --> 09:28.106
That is our orders. That is what we do.

09:28.235 --> 09:32.319
Why not? The boys are ready, aren't you?
Let's have a go. Come on!

09:32.448 --> 09:34.905
No fight!

09:35.033 --> 09:38.366
No! No fight now! Damned idiot!

09:41.832 --> 09:44.414
— Form a line!
- Defend!

09:45.836 --> 09:47.997
Remember your training!

09:48.130 --> 09:50.496
Shields!

09:54.136 --> 09:56.627
Hold your ground!

09:57.264 --> 09:59.346
You cowards!

10:06.523 --> 10:10.107
Get back!

10:11.361 --> 10:12.692
Cowards!

10:12.821 --> 10:14.937
Get back here!

10:16.784 --> 10:20.697
Caesar's scouts are only 30 miles from Rome.

10:20.829 --> 10:22.569
30 miles?

10:22.706 --> 10:25.288
His speed is uncanny.

10:25.417 --> 10:30.628
Of course, he has only a very few men,
which makes a fast pace easier.

10:30.756 --> 10:33.964
He is not leading an army,
so much as an armed gang.

10:34.092 --> 10:37.300
It is all highly irregular, unethical even.

10:37.429 --> 10:39.886
Gods, it is not even the war season.

10:40.015 --> 10:43.257
Surely he does not think
to attack Rome directly?

10:43.393 --> 10:46.851
— I think that is exactly what he'll do.
— How can he hope to succeed?

10:46.980 --> 10:48.720
The problem is, at this moment,

10:48.857 --> 10:52.065
we have only three legions in arms
for the defence of the city.

10:52.194 --> 10:54.185
Surely, three is more than enough.

10:54.321 --> 10:57.313
Normally that would be true
but the men are raw recruits

10:57.449 --> 10:59.314
like those who fled from the scouts.

10:59.451 --> 11:03.490
The rest are veterans of Gaul.
Caesar's men. Not reliable.

11:03.622 --> 11:04.987
Rome is undefended!

11:05.123 --> 11:08.832
My legions are mustering
as swiftly as possible

11:09.837 --> 11:13.045
but it will take at least four days

11:13.173 --> 11:17.041
to assemble a force capable
of defending the city.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.089
Caesar is two days away.

11:22.182 --> 11:25.470
- You touch it with a needle.
— What do we do now, then?

11:25.602 --> 11:30.187
We must make a tactical retreat to the south.
A tactical retreat, mind you.

11:30.315 --> 11:32.431
Leave the city? Juno's cunt!

11:32.568 --> 11:34.934
- Do you run mad?
— Don't speak to me in that tone.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.527
My friends, let us cleave to the matter at hand.

11:37.656 --> 11:40.022
Is there no alternative to retreat, then?

11:40.158 --> 11:44.777
None. We shall withdraw to Corfinium
and rally my legions there.

11:44.913 --> 11:49.657
Once they are gathered and in good order,
we will simply retake the city.

11:49.793 --> 11:53.786
Caesar has no hope
of reinforcement until spring.

11:53.922 --> 11:56.299
The towns of Italy will close their gates to him.

11:56.425 --> 12:01.010
We will have an unassailable
advantage in men and resources.

12:01.138 --> 12:07.099
So in fact, this is not a humiliating defeat
at all but a rare species of victory?

12:07.227 --> 12:10.264
Calm yourself. You lack
understanding of things military,

12:10.397 --> 12:15.016
else you would see that my actions
have been perfectly correct at all times.

12:15.152 --> 12:18.360
You've lost Rome
without unsheathing your sword.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.274
You have lost Rome!

12:35.422 --> 12:39.006
Pompeyan scum at our very door!
It's intolerable.

12:39.134 --> 12:42.092
lf Timon and his men weren't here,
they'd burn the house.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.721
They are not that energetic.

12:43.847 --> 12:47.055
This suicidal rebellion
has turned everyone against us.

12:47.184 --> 12:51.473
I swear, if Caesar were here now,
I would stab him in the neck.

12:51.605 --> 12:53.812
- He's ruined us.
— I'm not so sure of that.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.683
I think Pompey's position is deceptively weak.

12:56.818 --> 13:00.026
Think, think, think.
That's all you do, you silly boy.

13:00.155 --> 13:03.739
All our friends have abandoned us,
cowards that they are.

13:03.867 --> 13:05.232
We Julii are lepers now.

13:05.369 --> 13:09.533
Let us not exaggerate.
Not all of your friends have deserted you.

13:10.207 --> 13:13.665
And that will be remembered.
You are good loyal people.

13:13.794 --> 13:16.251
It's very tempting to abandon Caesar,

13:16.380 --> 13:21.465
but to do so now, well, that would
look like we're mere...slaves to fashion.

13:27.099 --> 13:31.342
You stay to protect the house but don't think
that your master and I will not return.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.015
We will be back by the kalends at the latest.

13:34.147 --> 13:39.312
When I do return, those who have not done
their utmost duty will pay with their lives.

13:39.444 --> 13:42.231
General, your escort is ready.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.196
Gnaeus.

13:47.035 --> 13:50.243
Durio, is the escort ready?

13:50.372 --> 13:52.454
— Ready, sir.
— Away then.

13:52.582 --> 13:55.289
Husband, the treasury?

13:55.419 --> 13:58.161
Yes, of course. Durio.

13:59.256 --> 14:03.625
You must secure as much
of the treasury gold as possible.

14:03.760 --> 14:07.127
Take a detachment and open up
the Capitoline vaults.

14:07.264 --> 14:09.471
There's not much time, so do what you can.

14:19.776 --> 14:25.112
Let's pretend we're Odysseus and his friends,
creeping out of the Cyclops' cave.

14:25.240 --> 14:27.902
We must be quiet as little mice, all right?

14:31.079 --> 14:33.195
Come.

14:36.293 --> 14:39.410
— Sorry about all this.
- Do not say so.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.753
I don't mind a little excitement.

14:41.882 --> 14:46.467
— All will be well, I assure you.
— l have no doubt.

14:54.603 --> 14:56.594
Let's away.

14:56.730 --> 15:00.018
And remember, no sound.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.360
Break it down!

15:07.824 --> 15:09.280
Here's a mercy.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.867
Instead of living out our lives
in shame and disgrace,

15:12.996 --> 15:17.080
we are to be raped and beaten
and torn limb from limb by a raving mob.

15:20.295 --> 15:22.957
These brutes will not let you pass, I think.

15:23.090 --> 15:28.005
— You may stay the night if you want.
- We would be delighted, thank you.

16:26.653 --> 16:28.689
Wait, wait. Wrong way.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.813
The Appian gate is to the right.

16:30.949 --> 16:35.318
— We're not going to the Appian.
- What?

16:49.134 --> 16:54.049
Your best method for pleasing a woman
is the warm, beating heart of an enemy.

16:54.181 --> 16:57.890
Women say they don't like it but they do.
It makes them wet as October.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.758
That doesn't answer.

16:59.895 --> 17:01.977
Well, failing that, talk to her.

17:02.856 --> 17:06.724
- Talk. But of what?
— That doesn't matter.

17:06.860 --> 17:11.900
It's all about the tone of voice. Pretend
you're putting a saddle on a skittish horse.

17:12.032 --> 17:16.241
"There, honey. Come now."
You know, that sort of thing.

17:16.369 --> 17:19.702
— That's all?
— What else?

17:20.373 --> 17:22.910
Tell her she's beautiful all the time.

17:23.043 --> 17:27.628
Tell her she's beautiful every time
you see her, even when she's not.

17:27.756 --> 17:29.792
And what else?

17:31.509 --> 17:33.591
Also, very important...

17:34.596 --> 17:38.088
when you couple with her,
there's a spot just above her cunny.

17:38.225 --> 17:44.642
It's like a little button. Attend to that button
and she will open up like a flower.

17:44.773 --> 17:47.731
How do you know this of her?

17:47.859 --> 17:51.397
All women have them. Ask anyone.

17:58.912 --> 18:01.119
— Come with us!
- Sit up here!

18:01.248 --> 18:03.079
You can make me happy!

18:07.462 --> 18:09.999
Here you go. Up you come.

18:11.424 --> 18:13.415
Come on!

18:26.606 --> 18:29.518
I will kill Octavia and Merula tends to me

18:29.651 --> 18:33.610
but if she cannot and I am taken alive,
then you must kill me.

18:33.738 --> 18:37.606
And then you must kill yourself.
Your survival would be inappropriate.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.482
I would not think of living.

18:39.619 --> 18:43.487
— Who would you prefer kills you?
— I'm old enough to take care of myself.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.205
That's my brave little man.

18:46.334 --> 18:50.247
Servilia...can my people be
of any assistance to you?

18:50.380 --> 18:52.962
Thank you but I'm sure
we can manage by ourselves.

18:53.091 --> 18:54.046
Very well.

18:54.175 --> 18:58.384
Mother, I would rather it were not
you killed me if you have no objection.

18:58.513 --> 19:01.004
Why ever not? You can't still be angry with me.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.677
Is that an order?

19:02.809 --> 19:04.265
You have never listened...

19:04.394 --> 19:09.058
Cerberus is howling for us and still
you plague me with your ridiculous feelings!

19:09.190 --> 19:12.853
— If you had only let Glabius and l remarry...
- Oh, always Glabius!

19:12.986 --> 19:17.901
— I spit on Glabius! I piss on the wretch!
— That's right, die as you have lived!

19:18.033 --> 19:20.194
— Poison brimming in your soul.
— Listen!

19:20.327 --> 19:24.036
I'll not argue with you.
Castor, cut Octavia's throat before mine.

19:24.164 --> 19:28.032
Please, Castor, let Mother do it.
I won't deny her one last pleasure.

19:28.168 --> 19:31.160
— It would be undaughterly.
- Listen!

20:08.708 --> 20:12.701
Consul Gnaeus Pompey Magnus
has left the city.

20:13.380 --> 20:17.623
He commands all noblemen
and knights to do likewise.

20:18.551 --> 20:23.136
Those that remain will be
considered enemies of Rome.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.344
Cowards!

20:47.372 --> 20:49.328
You heard, then.

20:49.457 --> 20:53.325
Don't know what good that will do.
Anyone wants to get in, they'll get in.

20:53.461 --> 20:55.326
Give us a hand, will you?

20:57.424 --> 21:01.337
— So your man'll be back after all, looks like.
— It looks like.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.048
You don't sound too happy about it.

21:04.180 --> 21:07.468
— Of course I'm happy. He's my husband.
— If you say so.

21:10.395 --> 21:14.058
I'm sorry. I was just talking.

21:14.190 --> 21:16.055
| talk too much.

21:17.110 --> 21:22.730
I don't know, Rissa.
I try my best to love him, I do.

21:25.410 --> 21:28.072
I don't know whether I want him to come back.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.202
I would not credit it if I had not seen it myself.

21:33.334 --> 21:38.624
Pompey's men deserting the city,
deserting Rome, half the Senate ahorse.

21:38.756 --> 21:40.587
A comical sight, no doubt.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.127
Gods.

21:43.219 --> 21:48.179
We are in a damned awkward position.

21:48.308 --> 21:53.223
If we stay we are declaring
for Caesar, for rebellion.

21:53.354 --> 21:57.688
And if we go, we...we are
with Pompey and the Senate.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.809
— There is no middle ground.
— What is the answer?

22:00.945 --> 22:04.779
Caesar is our dearest friend
but what he is doing is...

22:06.826 --> 22:08.737
God, I do not know.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.411
You must decide.

22:23.343 --> 22:28.633
Pompey then. We must go with Pompey.
The Republic is more important than friendship.

22:28.765 --> 22:30.847
- Do you agree?
— It's your decision.

22:31.893 --> 22:34.350
Pompey, then.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.228
We have no time to lose.

22:37.357 --> 22:40.849
Tell your women to be ready
to leave as soon as possible.

22:40.985 --> 22:43.362
I'm not leaving.

22:43.488 --> 22:45.228
What do you mean?

22:45.365 --> 22:49.859
I've waited eight years for Caesar.
I cannot leave now.

22:49.994 --> 22:55.489
— You cannot stay, not if I go.
— Of course I can stay. I can do as | wish.

22:55.625 --> 22:59.459
Mother, all who stay are enemies of Rome.

22:59.587 --> 23:02.169
— Pompey has declared it.
— Caesar might prevail.

23:02.298 --> 23:05.961
Yes, he might rule Rome for a week,
a month, a year even,

23:06.094 --> 23:10.087
but then some other ambitious man
will kill him and take his place

23:10.223 --> 23:12.635
and you will be the mistress of a dead tyrant.

23:12.767 --> 23:15.258
Mother, we know what happens to them.

23:15.395 --> 23:19.013
That is for the gods to decide.
I cannot help loving him.

23:19.148 --> 23:20.558
Vae, Mother!

23:20.692 --> 23:22.774
You are blinded by untapped lust.

23:22.902 --> 23:27.441
I'll get you a good big Cyrenian
at the market and have done with it.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.866
You'd better go.

23:33.788 --> 23:36.450
Don't be angry with me.

23:37.292 --> 23:39.749
We may be parted for a long time.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.665
Come.

24:04.193 --> 24:05.444
Goodbye, Mother.

24:07.030 --> 24:08.520
Goodbye, my love.

24:26.883 --> 24:28.965
Your daughter left.

24:30.136 --> 24:33.344
— When?
— Just now. I put a boy to following her.

24:33.473 --> 24:35.964
I'll put a stop to this nonsense.

24:43.608 --> 24:45.940
— Fetch your men.
- What?

24:46.069 --> 24:48.151
Now.

25:01.918 --> 25:04.705
— Why have you not left?
- I had to see you.

25:04.837 --> 25:07.544
It's not safe.
Everyone knows you're with Pompey.

25:07.674 --> 25:10.256
Don't fret. I'll be gone by sunrise.

25:53.010 --> 25:57.049
— That's all l have.
— Thank you but this is not a robbery.

26:01.018 --> 26:01.973
Atia.

26:02.103 --> 26:05.766
I'll give you a moment,
if there are gods you'd like to speak to.

26:07.400 --> 26:10.107
One favour — let my men live.

26:10.236 --> 26:12.568
Sorry. lt's orders.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.732
Give me your sword.

26:51.611 --> 26:54.318
What are they, the stars?

26:54.447 --> 26:58.315
Stars? Holes in the celestial spheres.

26:58.451 --> 27:01.943
Holes through which the light
of the heavens shine.

27:02.079 --> 27:05.287
— How big are these holes?
— They're big.

27:05.416 --> 27:09.079
They only seem small to us because
they're hundreds of miles away.

27:09.212 --> 27:12.500
— Big enough for a man to climb through?
—|suppose.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.507
A man would never be able to get up there.

27:16.636 --> 27:18.877
— I don't see why not.
— How?

27:19.013 --> 27:22.471
He could hold onto a giant bird.

27:27.063 --> 27:29.270
— It doesn't work like that.
— Why not?

27:29.398 --> 27:33.141
lt's philosophy. It's hard to explain.

27:46.541 --> 27:50.500
Really, Numa, that's quite unnecessary.
I beg you stand.

27:50.628 --> 27:53.836
No formality here,
not between old friends like us.

27:53.965 --> 27:55.705
A thousand gratitudes, Atia.

27:55.842 --> 27:59.050
We humbly seek the protection
and friendship of your family.

27:59.178 --> 28:03.217
Sadly, there are some people who say
that I am of the Pompeyan faction.

28:03.349 --> 28:06.762
- Are you not?
— All of Pompey's faction have fled.

28:06.894 --> 28:10.307
You stay for fear your factories
and storehouses will be looted.

28:10.439 --> 28:13.727
— I assure you, that's not true...
— Castor.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.938
— 5,000 denarii.
- That much?

28:20.074 --> 28:22.861
— |...
— Please, let's not be vulgar.

28:22.994 --> 28:25.235
I'll make the arrangements immediately.

28:44.307 --> 28:47.799
Where is your man Durio?
He is long overdue now.

28:47.935 --> 28:51.928
Durio is the best man l have. He won't fail.

28:52.064 --> 28:56.182
But if not, what then? How do we pay
the legions? How do we feed them?

28:56.319 --> 28:59.527
l have not the least idea.
You fret like a woman, Cato.

28:59.655 --> 29:04.399
Durio will return with more than
enough gold to feed and pay the legions.

29:04.535 --> 29:09.245
By any road we'll be back in Rome
before spring, so stop worrying.

29:19.091 --> 29:21.833
It makes no sense.
We should have been stopped by now.

29:21.969 --> 29:23.960
Why is Rome not defended?

29:24.096 --> 29:25.677
Our boys scared 'em off?

29:25.806 --> 29:30.300
Soldiers of the Republic do not run,
so it must be a stratagem, a trick.

29:30.436 --> 29:34.645
— Then it's a good trick.
— Unless the gods have abandoned Rome.

29:34.774 --> 29:38.107
lf Mars were watching,
he would not allow such a disgrace.

29:38.235 --> 29:40.442
Maybe he was having a crap and missed it.

29:40.571 --> 29:44.234
That sort of disrespect has
led us to this sad pass.

29:44.367 --> 29:47.859
If the gods are not respected,
then why should they help us?

29:51.540 --> 29:53.622
Still no troops.

29:54.627 --> 29:58.916
They will have flanked us, I expect.
Perhaps these drovers know something.

30:12.395 --> 30:14.602
— Salve, citizens.
— Captain.

30:14.730 --> 30:16.937
— You come from the city?
- We do.

30:17.066 --> 30:19.523
- How goes it there?
— You're Caesar's men.

30:19.652 --> 30:22.143
- We are.
— Fortune spreads her legs for you.

30:22.279 --> 30:24.770
Pompey has fled. The city is yours.

30:24.907 --> 30:28.365
- Why would Pompey flee?
— You boys were too fast for him.

30:28.494 --> 30:32.988
He couldn't raise his armies quick enough.
He's retreating south with the Senate.

30:33.124 --> 30:37.117
- See? Wrong for once.
— Well, enjoy your victory, boys.

30:37.253 --> 30:40.165
— How much do you want for the girl?
— Not for sale.

30:40.297 --> 30:42.504
What's in the wagon?

30:43.259 --> 30:44.795
— Grain.
— Show us, soldier.

30:44.927 --> 30:46.428
There's no soldiers here.

30:46.554 --> 30:50.593
My mistake. You all wear the soldier's boot,
so I assumed you are soldiers.

30:50.725 --> 30:53.592
Why would nine good soldiers
be guarding a grain wagon?

30:53.728 --> 30:55.764
I don't have to show you nothing.

31:47.281 --> 31:50.023
My fidelity always, domina.

31:51.869 --> 31:54.030
I do not like to doubt you, Proculus,

31:54.163 --> 31:57.781
but it's an age since I have seen
you at my morning levy.

31:57.917 --> 32:00.249
Perhaps you've been unwell. Goitres, is it?

32:01.253 --> 32:02.754
Goitres, as you say.

32:02.880 --> 32:05.587
Fat, greedy men often find it so.

32:06.634 --> 32:09.671
I shall kill an owl
that your good health continue.

32:19.146 --> 32:21.262
Speak sense, you creature.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.986
What vile trade is this,
bringing corpses to honest doors?

32:33.119 --> 32:35.110
Take it away!

32:43.129 --> 32:45.211
See what you have done?

33:02.690 --> 33:06.399
The city's unguarded.
It's true then. The Republic is fallen.

33:06.527 --> 33:09.690
The sky is still above us
and the earth still below. Strange.

33:09.822 --> 33:12.689
The gods will take their time in tormenting us.

33:12.825 --> 33:16.158
— Let's see what's in the wagon. Untie the girl.
— Not our concern.

33:16.287 --> 33:18.824
Follow orders.
Advance until resistance is met.

33:18.956 --> 33:22.164
— But that poor girl...
— You will do your duty.

33:22.293 --> 33:26.161
You are a mean bastard, that's your problem.
You've no love in you.

33:26.297 --> 33:29.380
You can talk sweet as you like
to Niobe, it won't do any good.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.544
She won't believe a word.

33:36.056 --> 33:38.263
You wake at last.

33:38.392 --> 33:40.383
l was worried.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.350
Water?

33:44.899 --> 33:46.890
Poor baby.

33:47.026 --> 33:49.483
It was not a dream, then?

33:50.529 --> 33:52.190
Glabius is dead?

33:53.240 --> 33:55.356
He is.

33:56.410 --> 33:58.492
I'm sorry.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.922
Why do you look at me like that?

34:12.051 --> 34:14.087
Like what?

34:14.220 --> 34:17.087
-As ifl...
— Did you?

34:17.223 --> 34:20.715
— How can you ask me that question?
- Did you?

34:22.811 --> 34:24.221
I did not!

34:25.189 --> 34:27.896
l'm tortured that you would
harbour such a notion.

34:28.025 --> 34:30.107
Look at me!

34:36.575 --> 34:42.286
Daughter, I swear on the masks
of all my ancestors

34:42.414 --> 34:46.657
that I had nothing...nothing
to do with the killing of Glabius.

34:50.214 --> 34:52.500
Who do you think did it, Mother?

34:53.842 --> 34:57.460
The streets are full of corpses.
It could have been anyone.

35:29.420 --> 35:32.503
"These are the words
of Gaius Julius Caesar,

35:32.631 --> 35:36.249
"direct descendant of Venus,
Proconsul of Gaul,

35:36.385 --> 35:39.593
"Glorious lmperator of the northern legions.

35:39.722 --> 35:42.338
"Citizens, l have returned to Italy

35:42.474 --> 35:46.183
"with the sole intention of claiming
my legal and moral rights.

35:46.312 --> 35:49.224
"l have no desire for unlawful powers.

35:49.356 --> 35:53.565
"I will name no man an enemy
who does not so declare himself.

35:53.694 --> 35:57.778
"Even so, the property of
those enemies will not be appropriated

35:57.906 --> 36:02.570
"and their person will remain inviolate
as long as their opposition be peaceful.

36:02.703 --> 36:05.661
"Moreover, to any man
that has taken arms against me

36:05.789 --> 36:09.657
"and now regrets it,
| gladly offer total amnesty.

36:09.793 --> 36:14.378
"However, those that continue
to use violence to oppose my legal rights,

36:14.506 --> 36:17.418
"they shall receive
that which they seek to give.

36:17.551 --> 36:20.167
"Under the auspices of Jupiter Capitolinus,

36:20.304 --> 36:23.967
"these are the words
of Gaius Julius Caesar."

36:24.099 --> 36:27.307
- What are you doing?
— I've done my duty. l have sinned enough.

36:27.436 --> 36:29.176
l resign.

36:29.313 --> 36:31.304
That's desertion.

36:31.440 --> 36:35.308
I'm a traitor and a rebel,
why not a deserter as well?

36:35.444 --> 36:37.480
You can't just leave the 13th.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.694
Goodbye, Pullo.

36:53.420 --> 36:56.708
To Venus, the birth giver, | make this sacrifice.

36:57.883 --> 37:02.126
I am Lucius of the Vorenian clan,
tribe of Stellatina,

37:02.262 --> 37:06.881
formerly First Spear Centurion
to the Prime Cohort of the 13th Legion.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.937
l have a wife.

37:11.063 --> 37:13.145
Her name is Niobe.

37:15.067 --> 37:17.524
Venus, let her love me as I love her.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.734
I give my blood to make it so.

37:45.431 --> 37:47.387
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

38:02.948 --> 38:04.984
You're very beautiful.

38:07.244 --> 38:11.453
I've come to see
that it may be through ignorance

38:11.582 --> 38:14.824
— that I have not treated you as I should....
— Please, don't.

38:14.960 --> 38:19.249
When we married you had only 13 summers,
soon enough I was gone.

38:21.425 --> 38:24.917
But now you are a woman
and I know nothing of women.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.135
Soldiering is all I know.

38:27.973 --> 38:30.009
Which is not useful.

38:32.019 --> 38:35.307
I've been sullen and untrusting, cold.

38:36.815 --> 38:39.147
But I am not made of stone.

38:41.445 --> 38:43.356
I can change.

38:43.489 --> 38:48.825
I swear on the life of my daughter's son
I will change if you would have it so.

38:48.952 --> 38:53.241
Please speak if you would not have it so
and I will leave without rancour.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.828
— It is I have done wrong.
- How so?

39:05.093 --> 39:06.958
lam...

39:08.013 --> 39:10.095
I've not been...

39:16.855 --> 39:18.891
The past is gone.

39:19.816 --> 39:21.852
We start again.

41:52.177 --> 41:57.388
I applaud you. You're about to enter Rome
as a bloodstained conqueror,

41:57.516 --> 42:00.724
and yet you look as calm as a cup of water.

42:00.852 --> 42:02.843
I am glad I appear so.

42:15.409 --> 42:18.492
Gracchus, something more cheerful.
