I just feel like I'm getting
the short end of the stick.

I don't know, man,
that shit pisses me off.

I deserve the perfect woman.

I deserve the perfect woman,

12:02.634 --> 12:04.201
Let me give you
another piece of advice.

That's bullshit.
That's an illusion, my brother.

[Kurt] I don't know, man.
I think you might be surprised.

12:54.817 --> 12:57.080
These boys are human, all right?

12:57.124 --> 13:00.475
I'm pretty sure most of them
just want one good woman
that they can come home to,

just for what they got to offer.

-Seriously.
-I'ma stay young.

13:26.414 --> 13:28.982
And the right woman
will make a man out of you.

That's only if she's the
right woman though, all right?

If a woman has a good man
at home, right?

13:46.216 --> 13:50.307
She got a good man,
do y'all think
she still steps out?

13:50.351 --> 13:53.658
And, you know,
smash somethin' on the side?

A side piece is nothin'
but another headache,
all right?

14:18.118 --> 14:21.773
And that's a headache
I do not need in my life.
Besides, I love my wife.

14:21.817 --> 14:24.907
Yeah, dude, but there's
a difference between
love and sex, man.

14:24.951 --> 14:28.389
So, Tarron,
you're happily married.

14:28.432 --> 14:30.870
That means you're not smashing
no chick on the side?

[Tarron]
Mm-hm. Uh-oh.
Nah, no, we ain't gonna do it.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.744
Yeah, we looked over your

19:40.788 --> 19:42.833
we're very intrigued
with the idea.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.313

19:44.357 --> 19:46.228
Yeah, we feel it could be
a very lucrative business,

a bit inflated.

back on our investment

that'll be a problem.

Well, we have a few
of the minor details
that need to be worked out

about where everything is
right now.

-Where's Richard?
-I don't know.

22:52.545 --> 22:54.024
All right, we'll get
started without him,

22:54.068 --> 22:56.287
we got a lot...
a lot to cover here.

22:56.331 --> 22:59.552
To be quite frank, we need
to renew the Birkshaw account

22:59.595 --> 23:01.554
to secure the future
of this company

23:01.597 --> 23:04.383
otherwise there are gonna be
some major lay offs
in the next fiscal year.

23:04.426 --> 23:07.777
To avoid that, I want you all
to meet Victoria Campbell.

23:07.821 --> 23:10.998
She's here temporarily
from sunny California

23:11.041 --> 23:13.435

projected goals in the new year,

23:13.479 --> 23:18.092

to make Victoria feel welcome.

23:29.059 --> 23:31.845

may be for only a season,

The fact that your son
can go into your phone

25:19.430 --> 25:21.215
and see pictures of
all of your hoes.

made my final decision.

-Sure.
-Okay.

if you moved this here,

right over here.

How about I just
move this one here

and turn it that way?

The design looks cleaner,
the lines are sharper,

one another,
and everything appears tighter.

26:56.310 --> 27:01.141

great, the shape will easily
catch their attention.

with this stuff?

on Georgetown campus
graduation week.

01:25:03.446 --> 01:25:07.014
We got really drunk
and we had sex that one time.

01:25:07.058 --> 01:25:10.714
I never saw Jay again
until after we were married.

01:25:10.757 --> 01:25:13.586
Terrance was born,
and when I found out
that Jay was your brother,

01:25:13.630 --> 01:25:16.459
I was just too ashamed
to tell you.

01:25:16.502 --> 01:25:18.330
He can never find out
about this.

01:25:21.812 --> 01:25:23.770
So what about her?
Do you still love her?

01:25:26.208 --> 01:25:27.818
[sighs]

01:25:27.861 --> 01:25:30.560
No. I never loved her.

01:25:33.432 --> 01:25:36.218
I'm really sorry that I kept
something like this from you.

01:25:37.480 --> 01:25:41.092
I just never wanted to
tear our family apart.

01:25:45.836 --> 01:25:47.011
Look who's waking up.

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:49.187
Hey, buddy.

01:25:51.494 --> 01:25:53.235
How you feelin', champ?

01:25:53.278 --> 01:25:55.193
I feel okay.

01:25:55.237 --> 01:25:57.413
Look, you get you
some rest, all right?

01:25:57.456 --> 01:25:59.371
As much rest as you need.

01:25:59.415 --> 01:26:04.246
And your mother and your father
are here for you. All right?

01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:11.122
[phone ringing]

01:26:14.517 --> 01:26:17.868
Hello? Yeah.

01:26:19.391 --> 01:26:21.741
No, I can be there
in like 30 minutes.

01:26:21.785 --> 01:26:23.526
Yeah, Terrance, he just woke up.

01:26:25.223 --> 01:26:27.530
Yeah, he's doin' fine.

01:26:27.573 --> 01:26:30.489
He's just gonna need some rest.

01:26:30.533 --> 01:26:31.577
Mm-hm.

01:26:32.535 --> 01:26:34.145
All right,
I'll see you in a few.

01:27:09.267 --> 01:27:12.879
-Hey, ma.
-Jesus, boy.

01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:15.969
When's the last time
you had a meal?

01:27:16.013 --> 01:27:19.669
Come on, ma,
I'm juggling a lot right now.

01:27:19.712 --> 01:27:23.412
[sighs] I'm trying to make
sense of my crazy life.

01:27:23.455 --> 01:27:26.328
[chuckles]
Life.

01:27:26.371 --> 01:27:28.591
It'll teach you
the hardest lessons.

01:27:30.984 --> 01:27:32.638
I don't know, ma.

01:27:32.682 --> 01:27:34.771
Like my life is just
completely falling apart.

01:27:34.814 --> 01:27:37.295
I hope you ain't coming here
crying to me

01:27:37.339 --> 01:27:40.385
'cause if you're looking
for a pity party,
you can just keep on steppin'.

01:27:40.429 --> 01:27:42.822
-[Tarron] But, ma--
-But nothin'.

01:27:42.866 --> 01:27:45.738
All of this is your fault,
Tarron.

01:27:45.782 --> 01:27:51.048
Secret loves you more
than anything in life,
and your brother does, too.

01:27:51.091 --> 01:27:53.703
If that's love, then I don't
want any part of it.

01:27:53.746 --> 01:27:55.444
Dammit, Tarron.

01:27:55.487 --> 01:27:58.621
You need to go someplace
and take a good, long look
in a mirror.

01:27:58.664 --> 01:28:00.666
You are far from being a saint.

01:28:00.710 --> 01:28:04.322
You're lucky that girl
didn't leave you years ago.

01:28:04.366 --> 01:28:09.545
Most dependable person you know
has made mistakes before.

01:28:09.588 --> 01:28:11.547
Nobody is perfect.

01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:12.722
[Tarron]
Yeah, ma, I know.

01:28:14.506 --> 01:28:17.030
I don't know, it's just gonna be
real hard to trust
after all this.

01:28:22.732 --> 01:28:25.561
Do you remember
your 10th birthday party?

01:28:25.604 --> 01:28:27.432
Back when we lived in Suitland?

01:28:28.912 --> 01:28:32.655
I spent all morning
making you a birthday cake

01:28:32.698 --> 01:28:37.877
and I put so much love into it
and everything that you loved
into it,

01:28:37.921 --> 01:28:43.840
and then your father showed up
with a big, pretty cake
from the store.

01:28:43.883 --> 01:28:46.973
Had all the cartoon characters
and whatnot.

01:28:47.017 --> 01:28:48.323
[scoffs]

01:28:48.366 --> 01:28:50.237
It made my little cake
look like a piece of shit.

01:28:50.281 --> 01:28:52.327
[laughs]

01:28:54.851 --> 01:28:58.028
Yeah, ma. I remember that.

01:28:58.071 --> 01:28:59.682
-[Motherdear] You do?
-Yeah.

01:28:59.725 --> 01:29:00.987
So then what happened?

01:29:06.645 --> 01:29:10.257
As good as his cake
looked on the outside,

01:29:10.301 --> 01:29:11.476
when we ate it,

01:29:12.825 --> 01:29:14.653
it tasted nasty.

01:29:14.697 --> 01:29:16.481
That's right.

01:29:16.525 --> 01:29:19.397
And now every birthday
you ask your wife

01:29:19.441 --> 01:29:23.096
to make you that same cake
that I made you.

01:29:25.055 --> 01:29:26.839
[sighs]
It's my favorite.

01:29:29.233 --> 01:29:34.543
What looks good to the eye
is not always
good for the heart.

01:29:48.948 --> 01:29:49.819
Hey, ma.

01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:51.864
Thank you.

01:29:51.908 --> 01:29:53.823
Tarron, sit your ass down.

01:29:53.866 --> 01:29:56.303
You are not going anywhere.

01:29:56.347 --> 01:29:58.828
You are not doing the same thing
your father did.
You are not runnin'.

01:29:58.871 --> 01:30:01.047
What is he doing here?

01:30:01.091 --> 01:30:03.659
Well, the last I checked,
this was my house,

01:30:03.702 --> 01:30:05.574
and he's as welcomed here
as you are.

01:30:05.617 --> 01:30:09.708
Look we are a family,
and that is never gonna change.

01:30:09.752 --> 01:30:12.319
You boys need to go outside
and settle your differences.

01:30:14.757 --> 01:30:15.801
[Tarron] No, ma.

01:30:20.632 --> 01:30:25.158
-I don't have nothin'
to say to him.
-[Jay] T. Yo, hear me out, T.

01:30:25.202 --> 01:30:31.034
Hey, Tarron. Hey, T!
Come on, man, hear me out.

01:30:31.077 --> 01:30:32.688
Come on, man, look.

01:30:34.341 --> 01:30:38.302
Look, I had no idea about
that shit about Terrance man.

01:30:38.345 --> 01:30:40.304
I'm just as shocked as you.

01:30:40.347 --> 01:30:44.090
Really? Tell me, Jay,
how is that possible?

01:30:45.831 --> 01:30:48.617
Okay, maybe not
as shocked as you.

01:30:50.227 --> 01:30:54.318
But I never knew that what
happened between me and Secret

01:30:54.361 --> 01:30:58.278
resulted in Terrance
being my son.

01:30:58.322 --> 01:31:00.411
So what, Jay? Hmm?

01:31:00.455 --> 01:31:01.934
You want some type of sympathy
from me?

01:31:01.978 --> 01:31:03.240
No, that's not what I'm saying.

01:31:03.283 --> 01:31:05.372
So, what are you saying?

01:31:05.416 --> 01:31:06.286
Look.

01:31:09.115 --> 01:31:10.116
When...

01:31:11.857 --> 01:31:13.337
When dad left us,

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:19.256
I made it my responsibility
to raise you.

01:31:20.431 --> 01:31:24.261
I taught you
how to catch a football,
you became all American.

01:31:25.915 --> 01:31:30.136
I taught you how to tie a tie,
you bought three suits.

01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:32.443
I taught you how to drive,
you got a fuckin' BMW.

01:31:32.487 --> 01:31:35.359
You also taught me
how to wipe the tears
from our mother's eyes,

01:31:35.402 --> 01:31:38.580
every time that you messed up
or went to jail.

01:31:38.623 --> 01:31:41.452
So, yeah, technically
you taught me how to man up.

01:31:41.496 --> 01:31:45.891
But everything that I have,
everything that I got,
I worked for.

01:31:45.935 --> 01:31:50.026
So, tell me, Jay, what does my
success have to do with us?

01:31:50.069 --> 01:31:53.464
'Cause you're my little brother.
My little brother.

01:31:55.205 --> 01:31:56.641
And after a while,

01:31:59.165 --> 01:32:03.126
I looked up to you.
I wanted to be you.

01:32:04.431 --> 01:32:06.172
Yo, is that shit enough for me?

01:32:06.216 --> 01:32:09.611
That didn't mean nothin' to me.
I didn't care about
none of that.

01:32:09.654 --> 01:32:11.264
You put that between us.

01:32:11.308 --> 01:32:13.876
Look, I was supposed to step up
and be the man of the house--

01:32:13.919 --> 01:32:16.443
Yeah, but what was good for me
was good for all of us.

01:32:18.402 --> 01:32:19.577
That was your ego.

01:32:20.622 --> 01:32:23.538
That was your ego
fuckin' up your head.

01:32:23.581 --> 01:32:25.714
-Ego?
-[Tarron] Ego.

01:32:25.757 --> 01:32:29.631
Don't even go there 'cause
it's your ego why we in this
bullshit right now 'cause...

01:32:33.286 --> 01:32:34.244
Look.

01:32:36.507 --> 01:32:38.596
I never wanted to
disrespect you.

01:32:41.556 --> 01:32:44.167
I was acting like
a fuckin' idiot.

01:32:45.647 --> 01:32:48.563
But let me tell you this,
what happened between
me and Secret,

01:32:48.606 --> 01:32:51.348
it was just a one time thing,
a silly game of Truth or Dare--

01:32:51.391 --> 01:32:53.611
Yo, yo, yo, Jay, save it, man.

01:32:53.655 --> 01:32:56.658
I done heard it one
too many times, man.
Save it.

01:32:56.701 --> 01:32:57.833
[clicks tongue]

01:32:59.661 --> 01:33:04.753
I just don't know with you, man.
I mean, it's always somethin'.

01:33:04.796 --> 01:33:08.583
So what, Jay?
I'm supposed to start
believing in you?

01:33:08.626 --> 01:33:11.411
Start putting my faith
in my big brother again?

01:33:13.762 --> 01:33:17.330
Tarron, you're a grown man,
I can't tell you what to do.

01:33:17.374 --> 01:33:18.854
You do what you wanna do.

01:33:20.246 --> 01:33:23.249
[dramatic music playing]

01:33:25.382 --> 01:33:27.079
You do what you wanna do.

01:33:29.255 --> 01:33:32.650
But I came here to talk to you
face to face, man to man.

01:33:36.872 --> 01:33:39.788
No lying, no animosity.

01:33:40.832 --> 01:33:42.268
I just want to be that...

01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:46.708
that reliable brother that
I always should have been.

01:33:46.751 --> 01:33:50.929
Right. So, how do I know
there's not something else

01:33:50.973 --> 01:33:52.452
that you're keeping from me?

01:33:53.628 --> 01:33:57.327
That's it.
There's nothin' else.

01:33:57.370 --> 01:34:01.287
I promise on my life, T,
there's nothin' else.

01:34:01.331 --> 01:34:02.811
So, what about the emails?

01:34:02.854 --> 01:34:04.943
I know you had somethin'
to do with that.

01:34:05.944 --> 01:34:07.032
Emails?

01:34:08.947 --> 01:34:11.384
I don't even know
how to work a computer,
what are you talking about?

01:34:13.909 --> 01:34:16.607
[phone ringing]

01:34:19.305 --> 01:34:20.829
Hey, yo, Kurt, what's up?

01:34:22.265 --> 01:34:23.701
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

01:34:24.615 --> 01:34:26.182
No, I can be there in like 30.

01:34:27.357 --> 01:34:28.271
All right.

01:34:31.274 --> 01:34:34.233
Hey, man, I gotta go.
Tell ma I had to leave.

01:34:37.584 --> 01:34:38.673
I'll call you later.

01:34:55.602 --> 01:34:56.473
[Tarron] Kurt.

01:34:59.998 --> 01:35:02.435
What's so important that
I had to rush over here?

01:35:02.479 --> 01:35:03.828
There's something
that we wanna show you.

01:35:07.005 --> 01:35:08.137
This should be good.

01:35:10.052 --> 01:35:13.316
[dramatic music playing]

01:35:13.359 --> 01:35:16.972
So the day that Kurt and I met,
when you were out of town,

01:35:17.015 --> 01:35:19.191
I was asking him to keep
a close eye on Victoria.

01:35:22.368 --> 01:35:25.502
[Kurt] After Secret and I met,
Secret asked me to pull

01:35:25.545 --> 01:35:30.463
the surveillance footage
from the other night
when you and Jay got into it.

01:35:30.507 --> 01:35:31.726
This is what I found.

01:35:34.076 --> 01:35:36.905
[dramatic music playing]

01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:52.224
[slams]

01:36:06.761 --> 01:36:08.980
I guess this is where you guys
can say, "I told you so."

01:36:12.244 --> 01:36:13.158
No.

01:36:16.335 --> 01:36:17.597
Just thank me later.

01:36:21.253 --> 01:36:22.298
[sighs]

01:36:27.042 --> 01:36:28.217
[scoffs]

01:36:39.489 --> 01:36:42.622
[knocks]

01:36:42.666 --> 01:36:43.885
[Tarron] Got a minute?

01:36:49.804 --> 01:36:51.370
How did you get in?

01:36:51.414 --> 01:36:55.853
Managed to keep a few friends
in a few places.

01:36:55.897 --> 01:37:00.031
I wanna say I like what you've
done with the place, but...

01:37:01.293 --> 01:37:02.817
I guess you did your best.

01:37:05.907 --> 01:37:07.082
Tarron, I know.

01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:12.870
I know how much it hurts
when you are so used
to being the player

01:37:12.914 --> 01:37:15.960
and suddenly you're the one
who's getting played.

01:37:18.136 --> 01:37:19.964
[laughs]

01:37:22.837 --> 01:37:28.103
Oh, man, do you wanna know
what the funniest part
about this whole thing is?

01:37:28.146 --> 01:37:29.321
What's that?

01:37:30.366 --> 01:37:33.282
The fact that I knew
you were an easy target

01:37:33.325 --> 01:37:35.284
from the moment
I laid eyes on you.

01:37:36.894 --> 01:37:41.420
The ones who think
with their dicks,
are always easy.

01:37:43.596 --> 01:37:47.470
Look, Victoria,
you have a family and so do I,

01:37:47.513 --> 01:37:50.647
so I'm not mad at you
about that.

01:37:50.690 --> 01:37:54.564
We both got what we wanted.
Let's just leave it at that.

01:37:54.607 --> 01:37:55.521
Family?

01:37:57.480 --> 01:38:01.832
Wait a second, are you referring
to the same family
that you left for me?

01:38:03.834 --> 01:38:09.796
Tarron, you are nothin'
but a weak, pathetic loser
of a man.

01:38:11.102 --> 01:38:13.191
Just goin' around trying
to perpetrate

01:38:13.235 --> 01:38:16.586
as if you're the world's
greatest husband
with a perfect life and wife

01:38:16.629 --> 01:38:20.807
when deep down inside,
you know how arrogant and sorry
your ass really is.
