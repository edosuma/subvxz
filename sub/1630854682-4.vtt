00:00.075 --> 00:02.042
How... are you? How...

00:02.042 --> 00:03.768
Are you still dating
Sara from homicide?

00:03.768 --> 00:05.603
I’m actually seeing
two Sarahs.

00:05.603 --> 00:07.438
Two Sarahs?

00:07.438 --> 00:09.042
What, are you polyamorous now?
Is that...

00:09.042 --> 00:10.537
Have you ever had
your heart broken?

00:10.537 --> 00:11.603
No.

00:11.603 --> 00:13.240
- Oh.
- Except by you.

00:13.240 --> 00:15.405
Move in with me.

00:15.405 --> 00:18.108
You know, I was always
planning on buying my own place.

00:18.108 --> 00:19.339
I know.

00:19.339 --> 00:20.603
Tueli!
- Oh, hi.

00:20.603 --> 00:22.603
Yeah, I’m his stepdaughter.
- Stepdaughter?

00:22.603 --> 00:25.405
Her mother and I lived
together for seven years.

00:25.405 --> 00:26.801
This is Kelly.
- Hey, Kelly.

00:26.801 --> 00:28.570
Can I stay for a few days?

00:28.570 --> 00:30.438
You said you had a big loft
by yourself...

00:30.438 --> 00:32.801
- But Kelly...
- Kelly doesn’t mind.

00:40.834 --> 00:42.405
Oh, hell no.

00:42.405 --> 00:44.306
No way, uh-uh.

00:44.306 --> 00:46.504
We’re not doing it like that.
That’s not how we do it.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.405
Not doing what?
What you talking about?

00:48.405 --> 00:49.801
You don’t just
get out the bed,

00:49.801 --> 00:52.504
go put on your clothes and then,
sneak out the damn house.

00:53.438 --> 00:55.405
But I actually got
different plans for you.

00:57.075 --> 00:58.207
What you talking about,
Willis?

00:58.207 --> 01:00.405
Eh, eh, eh. Just you wait,

01:00.405 --> 01:02.504
just you wait, Henry Higgins.

01:02.735 --> 01:04.372
You ready?

01:11.141 --> 01:12.537
Okay.

01:13.273 --> 01:15.405
Oh, hell...

01:16.603 --> 01:18.471
Ooh.
- Hey, hey, hey...

01:18.834 --> 01:20.207
Okay...

01:21.768 --> 01:23.240
Oh...

01:24.702 --> 01:27.438
Pah... pah... pah...

01:27.834 --> 01:30.372
Yeah, see? That’s what I was
waiting for, right there.

01:31.273 --> 01:33.207
Mm-hmm!

01:33.636 --> 01:36.570
Okay, no, no,
so you’re serious now?

01:36.570 --> 01:38.207
Show me what you working with!

01:38.207 --> 01:39.537
Wait, it’s...

01:39.537 --> 01:41.471
It’s stuck around my ankles,
hold up, help me out.

01:41.471 --> 01:43.471
What’s the matter?
- Get those...

01:43.471 --> 01:45.867
Okay, I got you.
I got you.

01:48.834 --> 01:50.834
Ooh! Alright, Flashdance.

01:54.702 --> 01:56.438
You like this?

01:56.438 --> 01:58.900
Oh, yeah. Well, that depends.
Can I get this every morning?

01:58.900 --> 02:00.636
Okay, you’re being greedy now.

02:00.636 --> 02:03.603
I’m gonna need you
to shimmy out.

02:03.603 --> 02:05.834
Girl, you ain’t seen nothing.

02:13.570 --> 02:15.735
You see that?
That was a stunt, girl!

02:17.141 --> 02:18.438
Oh!

02:18.438 --> 02:20.405
I didn’t break out
the "please don’t hurt ’em".

02:20.405 --> 02:24.207
Well, maybe... I don’t know
how you feel about...

02:24.669 --> 02:28.339
Oh, ooh! Look out now,
you gotta be careful.

02:29.636 --> 02:31.702
Gimme this one. Two...

02:31.702 --> 02:33.504
I don’t even got to look.

02:33.504 --> 02:35.504
I need to meet with Rickets
before his lecture...

02:35.504 --> 02:36.570
Get out!

02:36.570 --> 02:38.174
- Tueli!
- ...your car’s in the way.

02:38.174 --> 02:41.570
Okay, yeah. Can we just...
Can you give us a minute?

02:41.570 --> 02:43.900
Sure, sorry.
Oh, just as an FYI,

02:43.900 --> 02:46.240
I leave the house pretty early.
I get up, I go.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.702
I’m involved in a lot of
community organizational things,

02:47.702 --> 02:49.471
like study groups.
I’m pretty go-go-go,

02:49.471 --> 02:51.405
so Kelly, if you and I are both
gonna be staying here,

02:51.405 --> 02:53.207
is it cool if you park in front
of Nathan’s car,

02:53.207 --> 02:54.372
like on the street?

02:54.372 --> 02:55.504
Um...

02:55.504 --> 02:57.240
Tuelli.

02:57.240 --> 03:01.240
All you really had to say was,
"Can you move the car?"

03:01.240 --> 03:03.933
You know? And maybe...

03:04.834 --> 03:07.372
Just maybe add a please?

03:07.372 --> 03:09.768
Yeah, you could have said it
on the other side of the door,

03:09.768 --> 03:12.207
by the way.
- Sorry. I’m frazzled.

03:13.537 --> 03:14.801
Please?

03:15.405 --> 03:17.471
Um... those are my pants!

03:17.471 --> 03:19.438
Those are my pants...

03:19.438 --> 03:20.933
Um, okay. Tueli,
I’m gonna need you to leave

03:20.933 --> 03:23.438
so I can finish getting
dressed, please.
- Oh. Sorry, yeah.

03:23.438 --> 03:25.471
Forgot some people are weird
about nudity.

03:25.471 --> 03:26.966
Well, it’s not weird.

03:26.966 --> 03:28.636
You’re right,
my mom’s the weird one.

03:28.636 --> 03:30.372
She’s super open about
bodies and stuff,

03:30.372 --> 03:32.339
kind of free spirit. I’m sure
Nathan’s told you all about her.

03:32.339 --> 03:34.669
Actually, we don’t bring up
past relationships

03:34.669 --> 03:36.405
in our dynamic.
- Oh, that’s smart.

03:36.405 --> 03:38.636
Yeah, it’s probably
hard for him to talk about.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.537
Why?

03:40.537 --> 03:42.933
Oh, he was heartbroken
when Vanessa ended things.

03:42.933 --> 03:44.669
Vanessa’s my mom,
that’s what I call her.

03:44.669 --> 03:46.504
Anyway, I’m sorry,
I tried knocking.

03:46.504 --> 03:48.603
You can be chill with me here.

03:48.603 --> 03:49.801
Nathan’s like family, so,
so are you.

03:49.801 --> 03:51.372
Have a great day, Kelly.

04:04.834 --> 04:06.537
Oh, no, that’s Nazeer’s
girlfriends.

04:06.537 --> 04:07.966
It’s the Sarahs.
It’s two Sarahs.

04:11.471 --> 04:12.834
Podcast... listen
to your podcast.

04:12.834 --> 04:14.537
Tuesday, what happens
with that?

04:14.537 --> 04:16.570
I’m always working
on a Tuesday, though.

04:17.372 --> 04:18.933
My headphones!

04:21.702 --> 04:23.801
It’s not that I don’t...
Sam, Sam!

04:23.801 --> 04:25.273
Hey, hi.

04:25.273 --> 04:26.801
Hey, Naz. How are you?
I didn’t hear you,

04:26.801 --> 04:28.372
because I was just listening
to a podcast.

04:28.372 --> 04:29.834
<i>...spaghetti...</i>

04:29.834 --> 04:31.504
Sounds riveting.
- Mm-hmm.

04:31.504 --> 04:32.801
It is, it’s really good.

04:32.801 --> 04:34.669
Have you met Sarah and Sara?

04:34.669 --> 04:36.933
Hello. Hi, hi.

04:36.933 --> 04:39.306
That’s a triple hi. How are you?
It’s really nice to...

04:39.306 --> 04:40.702
Naz has talked like,
a lot about you.

04:40.702 --> 04:43.735
Um... Detective Harding,
how’s... Homicide?

04:44.339 --> 04:47.372
Homicide is...
It’s homicide.

04:47.372 --> 04:49.306
It’s always a fun time.

04:49.306 --> 04:52.471
Sara, the dog walker.
It’s really nice to meet you.

04:52.471 --> 04:53.966
Hi Brenda, hi Kevin.

04:53.966 --> 04:55.735
Uh, I’m sure we’ve met before.

04:55.735 --> 04:57.471
I don’t think we have,
I don’t remember.

04:57.471 --> 05:00.438
I’ve been picking up
Edwina’s dogs for two years.

05:00.438 --> 05:02.372
Guess you’re not much
of a detective.

05:04.669 --> 05:06.306
That’s really...

05:06.306 --> 05:08.537
Oh God... You got me.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.999
Both... Both Sarahs
brought me coffee.

05:10.999 --> 05:13.933
It’s like I’m swimming
in coffees.

05:13.933 --> 05:16.339
You got two coffees,
I feel like that’s a bit much.

05:16.339 --> 05:18.306
’Cause what do you do
with two at the same...

05:18.306 --> 05:19.900
How does...
Is one not enough for you?

05:19.900 --> 05:22.537
Well, some people
just prefer two coffees.

05:22.537 --> 05:24.900
And I do not
judge those people.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.966
I guess I’m just more
of a one coffee kind of gal.

05:26.966 --> 05:30.702
Right. Well, here’s a Sumatra
for you.

05:30.702 --> 05:32.867
Thank you so much.
Look at us all together,

05:32.867 --> 05:35.537
just hanging out with
the dog and some coffees and...

05:35.537 --> 05:37.735
This is just a really,
really good time.

05:39.075 --> 05:44.801
That’s terrible. It’s not...
It’s just that that’s
a lot of sugar.

05:44.801 --> 05:47.075
Yeah, Naz likes it sweet.

05:47.075 --> 05:48.735
I thought that
he likes it black.

05:48.735 --> 05:50.702
I thought you liked it
with cream.

05:50.702 --> 05:54.372
Uh... No, see...
What it was is...

05:54.372 --> 05:56.768
You know what,
I like them all equally.

05:56.768 --> 05:58.339
You know, I’m gonna go.

05:58.339 --> 06:01.570
’Cause I have to eat some salt
to counteract the sugar.

06:01.570 --> 06:03.339
How it is, because
I don’t want to... Bye.

06:05.306 --> 06:07.900
And then, she just stood there
like I was the weird one

06:07.900 --> 06:09.372
for not being chill
about the fact

06:09.372 --> 06:11.042
that she just walked in on us.
I mean, Sam...

06:11.933 --> 06:13.801
I could have just crawled
into a hole.

06:13.801 --> 06:15.801
Oh my God, I want to crawl
into a hole,

06:15.801 --> 06:17.999
like a big hole where there’s no
Nazs and like, no Sarahs.

06:17.999 --> 06:19.900
I don’t even know what
was more awkward,

06:19.900 --> 06:21.966
the fact that Tueli walked in
on me and Nathan

06:21.966 --> 06:23.471
while we was doing
a little da-da-da,

06:23.471 --> 06:24.636
strip tease thing morning,

06:24.636 --> 06:26.108
or the fact that she was
comparing me...

06:26.108 --> 06:28.075
Comparing me to Nathan’s ex.

06:28.075 --> 06:30.075
Okay, or the sheer
bizarro-land that you and Nathan

06:30.075 --> 06:32.042
tried to do a da-da-da dance
like strip tease

06:32.042 --> 06:33.372
on a Tuesday morning.

06:33.372 --> 06:35.339
I mean, I just ask myself,

06:35.339 --> 06:37.768
like how well do I really know
Nathan?

06:37.768 --> 06:39.405
’Cause you know I was gone
for eight months

06:39.405 --> 06:41.471
and I’m putting a whole lot
of my eggs in his basket

06:41.471 --> 06:43.669
when you know, maybe I need
my own basket.

06:43.669 --> 06:45.933
And I told you about, I was
trying to get my own place,

06:45.933 --> 06:47.834
so you know, maybe I should
just bite the bullet

06:47.834 --> 06:50.636
and sublet something
until, you know, I don’t know,
a house opens up?

06:50.636 --> 06:52.438
Listen, I think you’re being
really reactive.

06:52.438 --> 06:53.801
You know, the housing market
isn’t great

06:53.801 --> 06:55.702
and the bubble’s about to burst.
So, don’t do that.

06:55.702 --> 06:58.438
And then, the other night,
Nathan said

06:58.438 --> 07:01.801
that I was the only woman
that ever broke his heart.

07:01.801 --> 07:04.702
Yet, this morning,
Tueli was talking about

07:04.702 --> 07:08.438
how he was all heartbroken
over his breakup with her mom.

07:08.438 --> 07:11.504
Well, it’s just that...
Okay, we’re all adults here,

07:11.504 --> 07:12.801
so we’ve all had
our hearts broken.

07:12.801 --> 07:13.999
But still, you know...

07:13.999 --> 07:15.834
I think I just...
take a breath.

07:15.834 --> 07:17.867
You know, I’m in no rush
to move in with the man.

07:17.867 --> 07:20.075
I can just take a... a beat!

07:20.702 --> 07:22.108
Right?
- Yeah.

07:33.405 --> 07:35.735
Okay, the universe
is actualizing my dreams.

07:35.735 --> 07:37.603
Think about this:
you, me, roomies.

07:37.603 --> 07:39.042
Just so you like,
take a beat.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.174
’Cause Steve is away
at a conference. Yay!

07:41.174 --> 07:43.438
And the guest room is free
with an incredible duvet

07:43.438 --> 07:44.999
and I’ve used extreme
self-control to not binge watch

07:44.999 --> 07:46.834
Bridgerton season two,
waiting for a what?

07:46.834 --> 07:48.603
Oh, a Bridger-buddy.
Which could be you,

07:48.603 --> 07:49.933
it should be you,
it will be you.

07:52.042 --> 07:54.570
Uh, it’s actually not
a bad idea.

07:55.108 --> 07:58.042
Yeah, Bridgerton two,
you and me.

07:58.801 --> 08:01.108
It’ll give me a night
to catch my breath.

08:01.108 --> 08:02.867
Yes, take a beat, take a beat.
Up here!

08:02.867 --> 08:04.471
I’m allowed, right?

08:04.471 --> 08:05.735
Yes, give me a beat!

08:05.735 --> 08:07.669
Down low!
No...

08:07.669 --> 08:10.702
Let’s go, all around town,
friends having a...

08:12.933 --> 08:14.867
I’m dealing with an emergency,
I could use you both

08:14.867 --> 08:16.768
in the board room in five, thanks.

08:20.735 --> 08:23.207
Good job, good job.

08:23.207 --> 08:25.768
Hey. We need your help.
- Hello!

08:25.768 --> 08:27.471
Oh no, no.
- God!

08:27.471 --> 08:28.735
I’m not cleaning up vomit.

08:28.735 --> 08:30.966
Honey, the bathroom
is right through there,

08:30.966 --> 08:32.999
it’s a door away!
- I’m sorry...

08:33.504 --> 08:35.504
That came out of nowhere.

08:35.504 --> 08:37.735
Yeah, yeah, it’s okay.
I’m trying to keep this

08:37.735 --> 08:39.900
on the down-low
as a favour to Susan here.

08:39.900 --> 08:42.702
She’s feeling pretty... vulnerable.

08:42.702 --> 08:44.471
We got a couple calls,
noise complaints,

08:44.471 --> 08:46.207
fireworks being set off
near the Port Lands

08:46.207 --> 08:47.999
around six this morning.
Everyone said

08:47.999 --> 08:50.042
it was coming from
a junkyard on Commissioners.

08:50.042 --> 08:51.603
It’s in the file.

08:51.603 --> 08:53.504
Look in the file.

08:56.438 --> 08:57.636
Crud Stud?

08:57.636 --> 09:00.273
Owned and operated
by Curtis Eggars.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.933
The titular stud of Crud Stud.

09:01.933 --> 09:04.438
Yeah, not that I noticed,
but he is a stud.

09:04.438 --> 09:05.867
He’s really built.

09:05.867 --> 09:07.702
I got to figure out
where he goes to workout.

09:07.702 --> 09:09.537
Anyway, he’s in interview
right now.

09:09.537 --> 09:11.570
We were going to talk to him
and then, we...

09:12.702 --> 09:14.768
We found...

09:14.768 --> 09:16.570
She’s never seen
a dead body before.

09:16.570 --> 09:18.702
- Hmm.
- This is a homicide?

09:18.702 --> 09:20.471
Not exactly. Here.

09:21.471 --> 09:22.834
Oh, okay.

09:22.834 --> 09:24.867
You know what, give us a warning
next time you flash us

09:24.867 --> 09:26.042
with a dead racoon pic.

09:26.042 --> 09:28.636
How do you think I felt?
I stepped on it.

09:28.636 --> 09:31.603
Sweetheart, it’s not
a real human dead body.

09:31.603 --> 09:33.834
I’m prepping her
that it is... much, much worse.

09:33.834 --> 09:35.471
Okay, uh...
What’s your theory?

09:35.471 --> 09:37.735
I think the fireworks
were actually machine gun.

09:37.735 --> 09:39.207
If you look closely
at this little trash panda,

09:39.207 --> 09:40.669
he’s been hit
by at least five bullets,

09:40.669 --> 09:41.933
with another 15 on the scene.

09:41.933 --> 09:43.900
Alright.

09:46.240 --> 09:48.240
I’ll get ballistics
to run a test.

09:48.603 --> 09:51.174
In the meantime, we’ll have
a little chat with the...

09:51.174 --> 09:52.669
<i>Stud of Crud.</i>

09:53.603 --> 09:56.141
So? How can I help you
lovely ladies?

09:56.141 --> 09:58.636
I’m assuming I would know
if I was arrested, right?

09:58.636 --> 10:01.735
Detective Wazowski and I
wanted to ask you about

10:01.735 --> 10:03.834
your whereabouts this morning
around 6 AM.

10:03.834 --> 10:06.735
Oh, well yesterday, on...

10:06.735 --> 10:10.570
...Monday, I had lunch
with Maria.

10:10.570 --> 10:13.768
I met her on Rubble.
I call them my Maria Mondays.

10:13.768 --> 10:15.999
Slept over, woke up,
did a little bit

10:15.999 --> 10:17.834
of a Tuesday morning redux.

10:19.537 --> 10:22.636
And then, went to work
around 8.

10:22.636 --> 10:24.273
Okay well,
while you were reduxing,

10:24.273 --> 10:26.504
machine gun fire was reported
coming from your address.

10:30.900 --> 10:32.603
I lock up the gates when I
leave, but that doesn’t mean

10:32.603 --> 10:33.801
that kids won’t hop the fence, right?

10:33.801 --> 10:36.141
Kids. With machine guns?

10:37.966 --> 10:40.702
Only shooting I do is
on hunting trips with the boys.

10:44.768 --> 10:45.933
Wow.

10:46.999 --> 10:49.867
But I owe a beer to whoever
got rid of that vermin.

10:50.867 --> 10:53.273
You know, racoons
are an invasive species.

10:53.273 --> 10:55.669
They are on track to outnumber
us four to one

10:55.669 --> 10:57.570
and I do not like those numbers.
Do you?

10:57.570 --> 11:01.174
Curtis, do you own
any hunting rifles?

11:02.240 --> 11:04.537
I got a few non-restricted
firearms.

11:04.537 --> 11:07.999
Oh. Oh, okay.
Well, what are we talking?

11:07.999 --> 11:11.174
It’s on here. Just give me a
second, here. Let’s see.
Oh, there they are.

11:11.174 --> 11:13.735
I got some other
good ones on here.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.636
There’s the hunting rifles.

11:15.636 --> 11:17.900
Wow. Those are... Phewf.

11:17.900 --> 11:20.867
And I got my...
I got another one in there, too.

11:20.867 --> 11:23.867
I got my 9 mm in here somewhere.

11:23.867 --> 11:25.636
Well, there’s my 12-gauge,
pump action.

11:26.273 --> 11:28.570
There’s me, holding
the 12-gauge.

11:28.570 --> 11:29.966
Very nice, nice sunglasses.

11:29.966 --> 11:31.669
Thank you. There’s my 9 mm.

11:32.966 --> 11:34.339
Ooh.

11:34.339 --> 11:36.768
It’s all locked up.
It’s safe at home.

11:36.768 --> 11:39.273
I think you might be
forgetting one.

11:41.768 --> 11:42.966
An M16 machine gun.

11:42.966 --> 11:44.174
Hmm.

11:46.801 --> 11:48.999
100 % illegal in Canada.

11:50.174 --> 11:51.834
You know what,
you can confiscate that.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.306
Oh!

11:53.306 --> 11:56.042
He’s gonna let us confiscate
his illegal rifle.

11:56.042 --> 11:58.768
So nice!
- Yes!

11:58.768 --> 12:01.306
I’m just wondering why
you would use a machine gun

12:01.306 --> 12:03.075
to hunt a racoon.

12:03.075 --> 12:05.339
I don’t hunt them,
I get rid of them.

12:05.339 --> 12:07.933
Is it a crime to protect
your property?

12:08.669 --> 12:12.273
Uh, it is illegal to possess,
not to mention fire,

12:12.273 --> 12:14.933
a fully prohibited
automatic weapon in Canada.

12:14.933 --> 12:16.801
Yeah, there’s severe penalties.

12:16.801 --> 12:18.735
But if you let us know
where you got it from,

12:18.735 --> 12:20.339
you know, maybe we just
let you off with a fine.

12:20.339 --> 12:22.372
Hmm. You know,
or you can play tough

12:22.372 --> 12:23.999
and just serve three
to five years, it’s...

12:26.273 --> 12:29.075
I get my guns from a guy named
Jeff. Jeff Harvey.

12:29.075 --> 12:30.636
Where can we find him?

12:30.636 --> 12:32.702
He runs a business out
of a place called Bare Camp.

12:32.702 --> 12:35.372
Oh, Bare Camp! Okay, this... Okay.

12:35.372 --> 12:38.207
These people are naked,
this is a nudist camp, Kell.

12:38.768 --> 12:40.999
You’re kidding me.
- No, I’m not.

12:40.999 --> 12:43.372
Ballistics results
just came in. Come with me.

12:45.636 --> 12:47.834
The bullets found in that racoon
have been matched

12:47.834 --> 12:50.702
to the same gun wanted in
a homicide from three weeks ago.

12:50.702 --> 12:52.900
It’s possible your Crud Stud
is killing more than racoons.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.372
Now, I’m really close
with the guys on the case,

12:54.372 --> 12:56.174
so I told them I’d connect you.

12:56.174 --> 12:59.141
You’re gonna be working with
the Homicide crème de la crème.

12:59.141 --> 13:02.108
Really, really great guys.
So smart. Really funny.

13:02.108 --> 13:04.273
You’re gonna love these guys.

13:09.702 --> 13:11.900
Hi, Sarah. We meet again.

13:11.900 --> 13:12.966
Hey.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.405
Hello.

13:14.966 --> 13:17.207
Detective Dack Adams.

13:17.207 --> 13:19.405
In the early years,
they’d call me "Dick Dack".

13:20.141 --> 13:22.834
Not a term we use
for detectives anymore.

13:22.834 --> 13:25.867
Dick. Probably a good thing, right?

13:25.867 --> 13:27.174
Lot of confusion,
wouldn’t you say?

13:27.174 --> 13:30.042
No, yeah, yeah, sure. Confusing.

13:30.042 --> 13:32.933
Anyway, it’s great to have
you two working under us.

13:32.933 --> 13:34.438
We can use all the help
we can get.

13:34.933 --> 13:38.240
Help? No, no.
This is our case.

13:40.306 --> 13:42.768
Homicide trumps G&G.
Everybody knows that,

13:42.768 --> 13:44.999
we will run point
and you guys will assist.

13:44.999 --> 13:46.075
Did Ballard okay this?

13:46.075 --> 13:47.174
Yes.

13:49.240 --> 13:51.669
About three weeks ago
on a cold, rainy evening,

13:51.669 --> 13:53.372
a young man named
Richard Richardson,

13:53.372 --> 13:55.900
who also goes
by the name Dick...

13:56.372 --> 13:58.207
Full of promise,
full of dreams,

13:58.207 --> 14:00.834
decided to go out for
a bag of chips at the store.

14:00.834 --> 14:02.372
He had some dip in his fridge,

14:02.372 --> 14:05.174
he wanted to match the chip
with the dip.

14:05.174 --> 14:07.900
Comes back from the store,
goes to his apartment,

14:07.900 --> 14:10.339
can’t wait to open the chips.

14:10.339 --> 14:12.801
Out of nowhere, a red sedan
comes flying around the corner

14:12.801 --> 14:14.306
and the passenger decides,

14:14.306 --> 14:16.900
"I’m going to rip those chips
open for you."

14:16.900 --> 14:18.966
Pulls out an M16.

14:20.405 --> 14:22.207
Get down, Dick Dick!

14:22.207 --> 14:24.075
Dick! No!

14:24.999 --> 14:28.900
Nothing, 10 bullets in
the chest, five in the chips.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.867
Dick Richardson’s dreams
were no more.

14:32.471 --> 14:34.801
Detective Adams writes
crime novels in his spare time.

14:34.801 --> 14:36.075
Oh yeah, okay.

14:36.075 --> 14:37.438
What do you guys have so far?

14:37.438 --> 14:40.075
So far, we have Curtis Eggars
who bought this M16

14:40.075 --> 14:43.438
from a guy named Jeff,
who deals guns out of Bare Camp.

14:43.438 --> 14:45.207
The nudist colony?

14:45.207 --> 14:47.207
Yeah, Curtis said that
he bought a gun a week ago,

14:47.207 --> 14:48.306
but he could be lying.

14:49.273 --> 14:51.339
Curtis also claims to have
a rock-solid alibi

14:51.339 --> 14:53.372
the night of the murder,
a rock-solid alibi

14:53.372 --> 14:55.834
that goes by the name Felicia.

14:55.834 --> 14:58.471
Hmm. Let me guess,
she’s on Fridays?

14:58.471 --> 15:00.768
Yes, Fridays. Huh.

15:01.075 --> 15:02.867
Well, get a good night’s sleep, everybody.

15:02.867 --> 15:04.900
Tomorrow, we’re going
to Bare Camp.

15:04.900 --> 15:07.933
A cluster of naked Dicks
thrusting their way

15:07.933 --> 15:09.471
to the bottom of this case.

15:24.372 --> 15:27.174
Whoa! Look at this.

15:27.174 --> 15:30.273
Here you go,
here’s to taking a beat.

15:30.273 --> 15:32.207
Personally, I’ve been up
since 3 AM

15:32.207 --> 15:33.867
with the words "naked Dick"
running through my head.

15:33.867 --> 15:36.405
You know what? Dick Dack
was being dramatic.

15:36.405 --> 15:38.108
We don’t all need to go
in there naked,

15:38.108 --> 15:41.042
they can handle that and we can
hang in the van as backup.

15:41.042 --> 15:42.801
Okay?
- God, ’cause I just cannot

15:42.801 --> 15:44.273
go in there with Sarah Two...

15:44.273 --> 15:46.042
Just, I can’t go in there
with Naz’s girlfriend.

15:46.042 --> 15:47.999
- Why not?
- Well, I don’t know.

15:47.999 --> 15:49.537
I mean, who can really know? I
just...

15:49.537 --> 15:51.471
Kell, do you ever really
get over your ex?

15:51.471 --> 15:53.834
Huh, I certainly hope
Nathan is over his.

15:53.834 --> 15:56.108
Listen, I know that I’m not
the most adventurous person,

15:56.108 --> 15:59.042
but this whole polyamorous thing
has got me really

15:59.042 --> 16:00.471
feeling like a prude,
and Sarah Two,

16:00.471 --> 16:02.537
she’s just so confident,
she’s like a real free spirit.

16:02.537 --> 16:05.174
What is so great about being
a free spirit anyway?

16:05.174 --> 16:07.339
That’s how Tueli describes
her mom, Vanessa.

16:07.339 --> 16:09.504
Yeah, free spirit.
You know what that means? Flaky!

16:09.504 --> 16:11.537
Yeah, take your free spirit
over there, thank you very much.

16:11.537 --> 16:14.405
Okay, bye.
- I have no problem being naked.

16:14.405 --> 16:16.504
No problem at all. In
the shower, between the sheets.

16:16.504 --> 16:18.174
But other than that,
I just don’t feel the need.

16:18.174 --> 16:20.141
I’m a private nudist,
but nobody needs to see

16:20.141 --> 16:22.339
your coochie waving
all around the place.

16:22.339 --> 16:24.042
I mean, not your coochie
in particular,

16:24.042 --> 16:25.801
anybody’s coochie.
Vanessa’s coochie.

16:25.801 --> 16:27.504
Speaking of Vanessa,

16:27.504 --> 16:29.834
do you want to check out
her social media?

16:29.834 --> 16:31.306
Oh girl, are you kidding me?

16:31.306 --> 16:33.306
I have been watching her stories
for a week.

16:33.306 --> 16:34.933
You’ve been watching
her stories?

16:34.933 --> 16:36.075
Yeah, why not?

16:36.372 --> 16:38.240
So, you know
that she can tell

16:38.240 --> 16:39.240
when you’ve been watching
her stories?

16:39.240 --> 16:40.471
What do you mean?

16:41.240 --> 16:42.900
Oh, come on,
you must know that.

16:42.900 --> 16:44.801
That’s why Elliot banned me
from his social media,

16:44.801 --> 16:46.570
’cause he could see when
I was creeping his stories.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.075
No, no.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.405
Huh.

16:50.174 --> 16:52.042
"This account is now
private."

16:52.042 --> 16:53.834
Oh, like in
it wasn’t before?

16:54.438 --> 16:55.900
Do you think
she made it private

16:55.900 --> 16:57.174
when she saw me creeping
her stories?

16:57.174 --> 16:59.867
No. No, I’m sure she didn’t
even notice.

16:59.867 --> 17:01.999
That is embarrassing,
I feel so childish!

17:01.999 --> 17:04.075
Good! I’m glad you do,
you should feel childish,

17:04.075 --> 17:05.438
because I feel childish
all the time.

17:05.438 --> 17:07.240
This makes me feel normal.
- I can only be childish

17:07.240 --> 17:09.240
with you, though.
- Same, same.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.174
Are you sure you can’t be
childish with your BFF, Ro?

17:11.174 --> 17:13.075
Are you kidding me?
She’s way too mature for that.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.834
Can you pass me one of those
sausages, please?

17:14.834 --> 17:17.141
Yeah. Eat your naked sausage.
- You know I will.

17:25.570 --> 17:27.570
Kelly!
You have a minute?

17:29.207 --> 17:30.999
I talked to Tueli
about yesterday

17:30.999 --> 17:33.273
and it will never happen again.

17:33.273 --> 17:37.339
Yeah, okay. Uh... Hmm.

17:37.339 --> 17:39.900
You know, but she said something
that kind of...

17:39.900 --> 17:41.174
made me feel a little weird.

17:41.174 --> 17:42.570
Like what?

17:43.372 --> 17:47.471
Like... How you might have
been heartbroken

17:47.471 --> 17:49.372
when her mom dumped you.

17:49.372 --> 17:52.207
Wait, is that jealousy
I smell?

17:52.207 --> 17:54.339
- Jealous?
- No, this is incred--

17:54.339 --> 17:58.273
Wow! You’re jealous over me?
- Okay, stop. Stop.

17:58.273 --> 18:00.141
- Okay. It’s over.
- Just back it up.

18:00.141 --> 18:01.504
Yeah.

18:01.504 --> 18:04.900
I mean, but for real, though,
were you heartbroken

18:04.900 --> 18:07.108
when you and Vanessa split?

18:07.108 --> 18:08.339
I don’t know.

18:09.240 --> 18:11.438
My ego was definitely bruised.

18:12.306 --> 18:13.966
And I guess in the moment,

18:13.966 --> 18:16.042
I could have taken that
for a heartbreak, yeah.

18:16.042 --> 18:18.075
Maybe.
- Okay.

18:19.636 --> 18:21.372
Anything else you need
to tell me?

18:22.207 --> 18:23.471
Hold on.

18:25.636 --> 18:29.471
<i>I think something bad
has happened, I need your help.</i>

18:29.471 --> 18:31.372
But not as a cop, okay?
As my friend.

18:31.372 --> 18:33.372
Okay, calm down. Breathe.

18:34.042 --> 18:36.372
What’s going on?
<i>- I’m at school.</i>

18:36.372 --> 18:38.273
I’m trying to look for
my friend, Ray.

18:38.273 --> 18:40.669
<i>I don’t know, we were in
the library together and then,</i>

18:40.669 --> 18:42.504
<i>he started acting really weird
and aggressive...</i>

18:42.504 --> 18:44.537
Can you breathe for me,
please? Just...

18:44.537 --> 18:46.141
Just tell me what’s happening.

18:46.141 --> 18:48.207
<i>We were in the library
together, just working</i>

18:48.207 --> 18:49.471
<i>and then, he just bolted.</i>

18:49.471 --> 18:51.405
I don’t know,
he’s really messed up.

18:51.405 --> 18:53.372
Okay, so do you want me
to send someone down?

18:53.372 --> 18:54.933
No! No.

18:54.933 --> 18:56.273
<i>I don’t want some random cop
showing up</i>

18:56.273 --> 18:57.438
<i>and pulling out their guns.</i>

18:57.438 --> 18:59.405
He might be going back
to our lecture,

18:59.405 --> 19:01.042
but I don’t know,
I’m freaking out!

19:01.042 --> 19:04.207
I will be there as soon
as I can be, okay? Don’t move.

19:04.570 --> 19:06.108
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:06.504 --> 19:08.933
You need a ride?
- Sure, sure. Yes, please.

19:08.933 --> 19:10.339
Alright, let’s roll.
- Yeah, man.

19:10.669 --> 19:12.273
Tueli, is he
on anything?

19:12.273 --> 19:14.438
He takes this Purple Rain
stuff to help him study,

19:14.438 --> 19:15.702
but this was whack.

19:15.702 --> 19:17.273
He said he was going
into lecture--

19:21.306 --> 19:23.669
I can’t do it,
I just can’t do it!

19:24.141 --> 19:25.339
200 pages in one night?

19:25.339 --> 19:27.174
I’m not a goddamn robot!

19:27.174 --> 19:29.702
- Ray! Ray, stop!
- Gotta be on Purple Rain.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.372
Seriously!

19:32.240 --> 19:34.174
I just can’t work that fast!

19:34.174 --> 19:37.075
Lev’s Psych 100,
it nearly killed me!

19:41.174 --> 19:42.999
Detective Nazeer.
Who are you?

19:42.999 --> 19:44.471
- Veronica.
- Jody, we’re the TAs.

19:44.471 --> 19:45.702
Okay, listen,
we’ll take care of him.

19:45.702 --> 19:47.141
You guys get the hell
out of here.

19:48.306 --> 19:51.240
Hey, easy, Ray.
That’s your name, right?

19:51.240 --> 19:53.438
I’m Nathan, Tueli’s friend.
Let’s just take it easy, huh?

19:53.438 --> 19:54.570
Maybe even sit down.

19:55.174 --> 19:57.042
I’m sitting down. Right?

19:59.636 --> 20:01.042
Yeah, nice and easy.

20:01.966 --> 20:04.372
Just chilling. Okay, Ray?

20:04.372 --> 20:06.306
You’re gonna be okay, Ray.
You can trust them.

20:06.966 --> 20:08.702
Ray. Ray, it’s me!

20:10.075 --> 20:11.174
Hey!

20:11.174 --> 20:12.471
Tueli!

20:12.471 --> 20:14.273
Tueli, are you okay?
Are you alright?

20:14.702 --> 20:16.702
Take your time, take your time.

20:16.702 --> 20:18.636
Alright, Jeff Harvey, 47.

20:18.636 --> 20:21.669
Primary address
is Leaside, Toronto,

20:21.669 --> 20:24.075
but in the summer times,
he lives out of his RV.

20:24.075 --> 20:26.636
I just finished questioning
Curtis, whose alibi is solid.

20:26.636 --> 20:28.042
He’s not the shooter.

20:28.042 --> 20:30.603
Turns out his account
of acquiring the M16

20:30.603 --> 20:32.372
after the homicide checks out.

20:32.372 --> 20:34.438
Okay, so we find out
where he got the gun from

20:34.438 --> 20:36.438
and who had it before him.

20:36.438 --> 20:38.735
That is pungent.
That’s... intense,

20:38.735 --> 20:42.042
whatever it is you’re drinking.
- I know, right? So good.

20:43.141 --> 20:45.075
Hmm. Hmm, hmm, hmm.

20:46.372 --> 20:50.075
So, Adams is digging up
a carded informant

20:50.075 --> 20:52.306
who is also a member
at Bare Camp.

20:52.306 --> 20:55.240
We agent the informant,
who introduces us as customers.

20:55.240 --> 20:58.240
We buy a gun and
catch Jeff in the sale.

20:58.240 --> 21:00.372
Uh, excuse me.
When you say, "We buy a gun,"

21:00.372 --> 21:03.240
do you mean like,
we go undercover like...

21:03.240 --> 21:04.702
Undercover in the nude?

21:04.702 --> 21:06.999
That’s the only way
that he does business.

21:09.042 --> 21:11.768
Yeah, so you and Dick Dack
got that.

21:12.207 --> 21:14.636
Sure. If you two are weird
with it,

21:14.636 --> 21:17.108
you know, me and Adams
can take care of it.

21:17.108 --> 21:19.273
And you guys can be backup
in the van.

21:19.273 --> 21:20.669
Yeah, we’ll be in the van,
thank you.

21:20.669 --> 21:22.240
That’s... I like the way
you think.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.207
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
- Yeah.

21:24.207 --> 21:26.702
- I’m calling for backup.
- No, no, please! No more cops.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.504
Okay, okay,
but I’m staying with you.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.438
I’m gonna take you home
and then, we’re gonna find Ray.

21:30.438 --> 21:31.702
Call Kelly.

21:38.603 --> 21:40.339
Hey Naz, what’s up?

21:40.339 --> 21:42.603
Hey, yeah. We’re over here
at Osler U, we got a situation.

21:42.603 --> 21:44.405
<i>Nathan needs your help.</i>

21:44.405 --> 21:46.042
Okay, alright.
I’ll be right there.

21:46.042 --> 21:47.537
Uh, hey, I gotta go.

21:48.273 --> 21:50.405
What? Stop, no.

21:50.405 --> 21:51.801
Nathan and Tueli
are in a situation, okay?

21:51.801 --> 21:53.504
You’re gonna have to do this
without me for now.

21:53.504 --> 21:55.207
Stop, please don’t leave.

21:55.207 --> 21:58.570
Sam, there are three
very capable detectives,

21:58.570 --> 22:00.867
you’ll be fine.
- You know what, I’m gonna go

22:00.867 --> 22:02.570
and then, you stay here.
- Sam,

22:03.207 --> 22:05.669
Nathan rarely
asks for my help, okay?

22:05.669 --> 22:06.768
He needs me.

22:07.570 --> 22:09.108
You got this, okay?
- Okay.

22:09.108 --> 22:10.174
You’re good.

22:10.174 --> 22:11.537
Uh, watch her for me, please.

22:11.537 --> 22:13.240
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

22:17.504 --> 22:19.537
Students last saw Ray
heading here.

22:19.834 --> 22:21.603
You’re sure he was
on Purple Rain?

22:21.603 --> 22:23.636
Yeah, extreme strength,
foaming at the mouth.

22:23.636 --> 22:25.636
These are all common reactions
to the drug.

22:28.372 --> 22:30.405
That’s him.
- I don’t want this.

22:30.405 --> 22:32.339
I don’t want this anymore!

22:33.735 --> 22:35.339
Don’t want this.

22:35.339 --> 22:36.339
Hey, hey, no!

22:37.702 --> 22:39.075
Let’s go.
- Go!

22:39.075 --> 22:40.438
I don’t want this!

22:40.438 --> 22:41.702
Hang on, buddy!

22:55.801 --> 22:58.735
Oh God.

22:59.174 --> 23:01.636
Hey, hey, Ray? Hey, buddy.

23:01.636 --> 23:03.339
Hey, just take it easy, alright?

23:03.339 --> 23:05.834
We’re gonna... We’re gonna get
you down from there.

23:05.834 --> 23:10.273
I can’t... I can’t take this,
this is way, way, way too much.

23:11.372 --> 23:13.339
He’s having a seizure,
let’s go.

23:14.669 --> 23:16.174
Got you!
- I got him.

23:17.504 --> 23:19.207
It’s okay. We got you, Ray.

23:19.207 --> 23:20.438
On your side, on your side.

23:20.438 --> 23:22.570
I got his head.

23:24.735 --> 23:26.537
Get paramedics to
Osler University.

23:26.537 --> 23:28.207
Third floor atrium, right now!

23:28.207 --> 23:30.537
It’s okay, Ray. You’re good,
we’re all good, buddy.

23:34.504 --> 23:36.240
Alright, you’re allowed
to wear shoes,

23:36.240 --> 23:38.240
I put a tiny mic
in Sarah’s sneakers,

23:38.240 --> 23:39.537
I can do the same for you.

23:39.537 --> 23:41.306
No, no, I’m not going in,
you two are.

23:41.306 --> 23:42.900
I can’t.
You two have to do it.

23:42.900 --> 23:44.900
No, it’s just that we agreed, so...

23:45.867 --> 23:48.636
Okay, I’ve given this
some think and I realize

23:48.636 --> 23:51.306
that I can’t do it,
’cause Jeff will find me
too intimidating.

23:51.306 --> 23:52.966
I don’t know
what you mean by that.

23:56.438 --> 23:57.867
With the--
- Yeah.

23:58.768 --> 24:01.636
He’s not going to do business
with me if he sees it.

24:01.636 --> 24:03.471
And we’re done.

24:04.207 --> 24:05.471
You two go in.

24:05.471 --> 24:07.471
I’ll stay outside,
waiting on your every word.

24:07.471 --> 24:09.702
Once you have a deal
for the gun, let me know

24:09.702 --> 24:11.240
and I will jump in
and nab him.

24:11.240 --> 24:14.702
Wait. Uh, sorry,
could we just...

24:14.702 --> 24:18.504
Like, please. No, I can’t,
I can’t, I can’t. I, well--

24:18.504 --> 24:20.405
Come on, come on.
It’s gonna be fun.

24:20.405 --> 24:21.768
I don’t see how this
will be fun.

24:21.768 --> 24:23.669
It is, fun with a capital F.

24:27.372 --> 24:31.207
Hello, hi.
Uh, we’re here to register.

24:31.207 --> 24:32.570
Wazowski and Harding.

24:33.471 --> 24:35.471
Uh, how much clothes
are you allowed to wear?

24:35.471 --> 24:37.405
We are not clothing optional.

24:37.405 --> 24:39.273
You can only wear clothes
for safety.

24:39.273 --> 24:40.537
Like, if you’re cold.

24:40.537 --> 24:41.933
Do you feel that?

24:41.933 --> 24:43.636
It’s really cold.

24:43.636 --> 24:45.669
We lose our heat through
the top portion of our body,

24:45.669 --> 24:47.702
not the bottom. So, if you must,
put on a shirt.

24:47.702 --> 24:49.801
Oh, good. I’ll just probably
wear this one, then.

24:49.801 --> 24:51.636
Not that shirt. Too sexual.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.768
Okay, really?

24:58.933 --> 25:01.537
No sexual behaviour,
no inappropriate comments

25:01.537 --> 25:04.504
and when you sit, use a towel.
Understood?

25:04.504 --> 25:05.900
Yeah.

25:05.900 --> 25:07.570
Change room’s behind you.

25:07.570 --> 25:09.339
Thanks.

25:19.966 --> 25:21.306
Oh, God.

25:21.306 --> 25:23.207
It’s like they’re taunting me.

25:24.570 --> 25:26.273
I’ve always wanted to join
a nudist colony.

25:26.273 --> 25:27.438
Apparently,
it’s really relaxing.

25:27.438 --> 25:30.504
Yeah. I am so relaxed
right now.

25:30.504 --> 25:31.966
Well, you’re gonna draw more
attention this way.

25:31.966 --> 25:34.537
You could at least try.
- This is me trying!

25:34.537 --> 25:37.405
Can you see anything?
Here, let’s do this.

25:37.405 --> 25:39.636
Well, the pamphlet said
any coverage is

25:39.636 --> 25:41.570
too much coverage, so...

25:41.834 --> 25:44.372
You look great, by the way.
- Thank you.

25:52.867 --> 25:54.669
Companion basket...

25:57.405 --> 26:00.405
Okay, where...
Where’s your CI agent?

26:00.405 --> 26:01.702
Isn’t she supposed
to meet us here?

26:01.702 --> 26:02.999
Yeah, she should be here somewhere.

26:02.999 --> 26:04.669
She’s really tight with
that Jeff guy.

26:04.669 --> 26:07.372
- Can we trust her?
- As much as you ever can.

26:07.372 --> 26:08.834
She was the sister
of a drug dealer,

26:08.834 --> 26:11.471
she turned her entire family in
for a shorter sentence

26:11.471 --> 26:14.339
and she did about
six months in jail.

26:14.339 --> 26:16.504
Now, she’s out, trying
to turn her life around.

26:16.504 --> 26:18.240
Her name is Lena or Lana.

26:18.240 --> 26:19.669
- Layna?
- Layna!

26:19.669 --> 26:21.702
Hey, I know you.
- Hi.

26:22.504 --> 26:24.504
I’m sorry, but we can’t
trust her, we can’t use her,

26:24.504 --> 26:26.372
because I arrested her.
- Can you trust me?

26:27.405 --> 26:29.438
You turned my life around.

26:29.438 --> 26:31.966
You got me out of
my sister’s clutches, so...

26:31.966 --> 26:34.867
I’m happy to help, seriously.

26:35.966 --> 26:37.801
You’re not supposed to be
wearing a towel.

26:37.801 --> 26:39.834
You know what?
Fine, fine, fine.

26:39.834 --> 26:42.471
Just please make
the introduction and then,

26:42.471 --> 26:44.537
let’s just get out of here, okay?

26:46.438 --> 26:48.702
She seems cool. Go with it.

26:51.900 --> 26:54.438
Okay, eyes on Jeff,
he’s over by the hot dogs.

26:57.042 --> 26:59.471
Has he confirmed
he’s gonna sell us a gun?

26:59.471 --> 27:00.966
Well, he doesn’t confirm anything,

27:00.966 --> 27:02.933
he’s smarter than that.
He’s agreed to meet.

27:02.933 --> 27:04.471
You’re ready
for the introduction?

27:04.471 --> 27:05.636
Mm-hmm.

27:05.636 --> 27:07.042
Hey, Jeff, babe.
- Hey.

27:07.042 --> 27:10.537
- How’s it going?
- Lay-lay, where you been?

27:10.867 --> 27:13.603
You know, you and Naz
have a lot of similarities.

27:13.603 --> 27:15.405
Did you guys have
a good sex life?

27:15.834 --> 27:17.966
We’re not having
this conversation.

27:19.075 --> 27:20.537
Right.

27:21.405 --> 27:22.636
Well, these are my friends

27:22.636 --> 27:24.405
that I wanted
to introduce you to.

27:24.405 --> 27:26.768
Oh, you stick out
like a sore thumb.

27:26.768 --> 27:30.339
Textiles, eh?
People who prefer to be clothed.

27:30.339 --> 27:31.603
Take a note
from everybody here.

27:31.603 --> 27:33.801
Towels are for sitting,
not covering.

27:33.801 --> 27:36.405
You don’t see me wearing
sofa cushions

27:36.405 --> 27:37.570
to cover up, do you?

27:41.405 --> 27:42.801
We go back
to the trailer and chat?

27:42.801 --> 27:44.603
- Yeah.
- Okay, after you.

27:44.603 --> 27:45.867
Okay.

27:48.042 --> 27:49.669
How you doin’?

27:49.933 --> 27:52.801
Man, what...
What happened?

27:53.702 --> 27:55.504
You had a seizure.

27:56.537 --> 27:59.042
Yeah, you were on some
messed-up drugs.

27:59.042 --> 28:00.471
We, um...

28:00.471 --> 28:02.405
found this in your pocket.

28:02.669 --> 28:03.933
Purple Rain.

28:05.108 --> 28:06.570
Helps me study.

28:06.570 --> 28:07.669
Mm-hmm.

28:07.669 --> 28:08.999
I feel really focused.

28:08.999 --> 28:10.405
You know, I just...

28:10.405 --> 28:11.867
I just sprinkle a little bit
in my coffee.

28:11.867 --> 28:14.108
- Hmm.
- It’s amazing.

28:14.108 --> 28:16.702
Seriously.
So then, I said, I’d...

28:16.702 --> 28:19.900
You know, buy more
to share with my study group

28:19.900 --> 28:22.339
and then, this morning,
I tried snorting it...

28:22.339 --> 28:25.669
That’s the thing with
these new synthetic drugs, Ray.

28:25.669 --> 28:27.900
The so-called manufacturer
can’t be relied upon

28:27.900 --> 28:29.834
to be consistent. Plus...

28:29.834 --> 28:31.768
The effects are completely different,

28:31.768 --> 28:34.537
depending on how much you take,
or how you take it.

28:34.801 --> 28:37.999
You... You want to tell me
who you got it from?

28:37.999 --> 28:39.504
I never met the person.

28:39.504 --> 28:42.438
I just... send an e-transfer
and then, get a text

28:42.438 --> 28:44.669
of where to pick it up
in a mailbox on campus.

28:44.999 --> 28:46.405
What mailbox?

28:46.405 --> 28:49.141
Uh, well this time,
it was in the area

28:49.141 --> 28:51.603
where the professors’
offices are.

28:51.603 --> 28:54.933
In a mailbox, number 514.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.867
And when did you pick it up?

28:56.867 --> 28:58.966
Monday morning, 9:30.

28:59.570 --> 29:02.537
Think I got there
a few minutes later.

29:04.042 --> 29:07.603
You bought these drugs for
your whole study group?

29:07.603 --> 29:08.999
Yeah.

29:08.999 --> 29:11.669
We’re all freaking out,
falling behind.

29:11.669 --> 29:13.669
I... bought some for everyone.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.834
Your study group including
Tueli?

29:15.834 --> 29:17.075
Yes.

29:17.075 --> 29:18.372
Yeah.

29:23.735 --> 29:26.834
Kelly, hey. How’s Ray?

29:27.900 --> 29:31.702
Ah, they’re gonna keep him
in the hospital tonight,

29:31.702 --> 29:34.735
but he’s gonna be fine.
How are you feeling?

29:34.735 --> 29:36.174
Okay.

29:36.537 --> 29:38.900
Yeah, okay. Uh...

29:38.900 --> 29:40.966
You don’t need to look
after me, I’m fine.

29:40.966 --> 29:42.900
Nathan will be back soon, so...

29:42.900 --> 29:44.438
Tueli, uh...

29:44.438 --> 29:46.108
Tueli, can you sit down?

29:46.108 --> 29:47.669
I’m really tired,
I should go to bed--

29:47.669 --> 29:48.999
Tueli, please.

29:53.141 --> 29:54.867
Can you look at me?

29:56.438 --> 29:58.504
I said, look at me, Tueli.

29:58.504 --> 30:02.537
Look, we did this your way.
No cops, just friends.

30:02.537 --> 30:04.834
So, here we are. Friends.

30:07.900 --> 30:10.966
Ray gave that stuff out
to everybody in the study group.

30:10.966 --> 30:12.042
Did you take any?

30:12.042 --> 30:13.174
No.

30:13.735 --> 30:15.636
But Ray’s been fine
until now.

30:15.636 --> 30:18.537
His grades went up, he’s been
writing amazing papers.

30:18.537 --> 30:21.471
You have no idea how much
pressure is on me right now.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.174
I have to get my scholarship
renewed for next year,

30:23.174 --> 30:24.801
if I don’t, I can’t come back.

30:24.801 --> 30:27.603
I’m doing my master’s program,
I’m being a TA,

30:27.603 --> 30:30.471
I’m spearheading two community
organizations in my spare time.

30:30.471 --> 30:31.702
You don’t get it.

30:31.702 --> 30:32.999
I’m about to snap.

30:32.999 --> 30:35.702
And you will snap
if you rely on that stuff.

30:36.735 --> 30:38.108
Do you get that?

30:51.867 --> 30:52.999
Thank you.

30:54.966 --> 30:56.735
You’re nicer
with your clothes on.

30:58.669 --> 31:00.834
Please don’t tell Nathan.

31:01.108 --> 31:02.669
He’ll tell my mom.

31:03.801 --> 31:05.867
They’ve been having dinner
together like,

31:05.867 --> 31:08.801
once a month and I swear,
if he tells her, she’ll freak.

31:09.603 --> 31:12.702
You’ve been getting
together with Nathan and
your mom, lately?

31:12.702 --> 31:14.603
Just like,
the last six months, maybe.

31:14.603 --> 31:15.900
Since I started school.

31:15.900 --> 31:17.207
Alright.

31:17.207 --> 31:19.504
Look, I gotta get
back to work, okay?

31:19.504 --> 31:22.867
But I’m glad you’re...
doing alright.

31:34.504 --> 31:36.768
Well, thank you so much
for your help.

31:40.504 --> 31:43.900
Bad news. Our little
Monday morning drug drop

31:43.900 --> 31:45.900
is a dead-end, literally.

31:45.900 --> 31:49.966
Mailbox 514 belonged
to one Dr. Topper Levenson,

31:49.966 --> 31:53.141
who passed away nine months ago.

31:53.834 --> 31:57.570
So, unless Dr. Top Lev
is selling Purple Rain

31:57.570 --> 31:58.801
from the great beyond...

31:58.801 --> 32:01.570
Someone else might have
coopted his mailbox.

32:01.570 --> 32:02.900
It could be anyone.

32:02.900 --> 32:04.108
Yeah.

32:04.108 --> 32:05.240
Top Lev.

32:06.735 --> 32:08.174
Top Lev.

32:08.174 --> 32:09.900
Levenson. Ray.

32:09.900 --> 32:11.867
Didn’t he say something
about a professor Lev?

32:12.207 --> 32:13.933
Psych 100, that’s what he said.

32:16.108 --> 32:18.570
Guess his TAs must have
continued teaching the course

32:18.570 --> 32:19.900
after he died.

32:22.075 --> 32:25.207
There are two of them.
V. Sawyers and J. Maleki.

32:25.207 --> 32:27.966
As in Veronica and Jody.

32:28.273 --> 32:30.603
You think they still have keys
to his mailbox?

32:31.273 --> 32:32.867
Uh...

32:37.042 --> 32:39.207
Well, according to this,
Jody was teaching

32:39.207 --> 32:41.768
the Abnormal Psych tutorial
last Monday morning.

32:41.999 --> 32:44.042
But guess who had
that Monday morning off?

32:44.042 --> 32:45.702
Veronica Sawyers.

32:45.702 --> 32:47.867
Leaving her free
to deal some Purple Rain.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.999
Love it. Love it!

32:59.537 --> 33:00.933
Veronica Sawyers.

33:00.933 --> 33:02.042
Hi, detectives.

33:02.042 --> 33:03.801
Is everything okay?

33:03.801 --> 33:06.207
Yeah, we’d like to know where
you were on Monday morning.

33:06.207 --> 33:08.042
This past Monday?
I was here.

33:08.042 --> 33:12.306
I was giving my famous
APA citation demo.

33:12.834 --> 33:14.240
It was pretty lit.

33:16.174 --> 33:17.999
Really?
Because the work schedule says

33:17.999 --> 33:19.273
that you don’t work Mondays.

33:19.273 --> 33:21.207
Normally, no. Uh...

33:21.867 --> 33:24.075
This past week, Jody begged me
to cover for her.

33:24.075 --> 33:27.834
She said she had a flute recital
of her niece’s she had to go to.

33:27.834 --> 33:29.174
Jody did?

33:29.174 --> 33:30.339
Yeah.

33:32.042 --> 33:34.570
Who has a flute recital
at 9 AM?

33:43.933 --> 33:44.933
There.

33:44.933 --> 33:47.207
There she is. Jody!

33:47.207 --> 33:48.867
Can we talk to you?

33:51.669 --> 33:53.999
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

33:56.075 --> 33:57.603
Jody, stop!

33:59.141 --> 34:01.636
Jody Maleki,
you are under arrest.

34:01.636 --> 34:02.900
For what?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.207
This is harassment!

34:05.207 --> 34:07.999
For this! Purple Rain.

34:10.702 --> 34:12.075
I never meant to--

34:12.075 --> 34:14.207
Cause us any sorrow?
Tell it to the judge, sweetie.

34:14.207 --> 34:15.735
Hands behind your back.

34:17.075 --> 34:18.768
Layna tells me
you two ladies

34:18.768 --> 34:20.702
are looking
for a powerful weapon.

34:20.702 --> 34:23.042
Thing is, I’m having trouble
imagining what a couple

34:23.042 --> 34:26.999
of sweeties like yourselves
want with a machine gun.

34:26.999 --> 34:29.075
First of all,
we’re not that sweet.

34:29.075 --> 34:32.075
Speak for yourself,
I’m pretty sweet. Me.

34:33.867 --> 34:36.801
Sweetie so shy, she won’t even
drop her towel at a nudist camp.

34:36.801 --> 34:38.108
Uh...

34:38.108 --> 34:41.075
Well, no, I’m not shy.
It’s just, um...

34:41.735 --> 34:44.966
Like I have a...
Like, a B12 deficiency,

34:44.966 --> 34:47.108
so I have a hard time just
keeping my hands

34:47.108 --> 34:48.933
and really thin feet warm.

34:48.933 --> 34:51.867
We’re here because, well...

34:52.669 --> 34:53.768
We need protection.

34:53.768 --> 34:55.702
Oh.

34:57.636 --> 34:58.834
Hey!

35:00.702 --> 35:01.900
What’s going on?

35:01.900 --> 35:04.339
Many seeds are germinating.
Physical seeds.

35:04.834 --> 35:08.075
Plants, trees, seeds in my mind,
not to mention the seeds

35:08.075 --> 35:09.801
of this undercover play
we’re on.

35:09.801 --> 35:11.174
I don’t know what
you’re talking about.

35:11.174 --> 35:13.669
Where are we at?
What’s the progress?

35:14.966 --> 35:17.240
Standby. I’m on it.

35:21.273 --> 35:22.867
They’re in the RV with Jeff.

35:23.867 --> 35:25.240
I do know that.

35:25.735 --> 35:27.900
Okay, I need to get closer.

35:31.273 --> 35:33.999
- Oh, mm-hmm.
- It’s not clothing optional.

35:33.999 --> 35:35.999
Yeah, sir, I am a cop

35:35.999 --> 35:37.801
and you have a guy in there,
selling guns.

35:37.801 --> 35:39.075
Where’s your warrant?

35:39.075 --> 35:40.735
We don’t have one.

35:40.735 --> 35:42.669
We need to know the guns
are on the premises.

35:42.669 --> 35:44.273
You’re welcome to enter
the premises

35:44.273 --> 35:46.042
if you remove
your clothing first.

35:46.042 --> 35:48.174
Or are you saying that
the rules don’t apply to you?

35:48.174 --> 35:49.999
Look, I can’t go
in there naked.

35:49.999 --> 35:52.141
The rules state you can wear
clothing for safety,

35:52.141 --> 35:53.900
but it cannot be sexual
in nature.

35:53.900 --> 35:57.273
That shirt, it’s very sexual.
- What...

35:57.273 --> 35:59.735
Too sexual, take it off Kelly,
let’s go.

35:59.735 --> 36:01.933
Is that fanny pack for safety?

36:03.042 --> 36:04.735
Yeah.
- It’s where I keep
my golf balls.

36:04.735 --> 36:05.867
It’s a good shirt.

36:05.867 --> 36:07.108
Suits your eyes.

36:07.471 --> 36:08.999
Move.

36:13.702 --> 36:15.867
I don’t buy you two
as a couple.

36:16.306 --> 36:17.735
Well.

36:18.306 --> 36:19.471
Okay.

36:20.471 --> 36:23.042
Listen, the truth is...

36:23.339 --> 36:25.306
Sarah and I,
we dated the same guy.

36:25.306 --> 36:27.207
I mean, not at the same time.
I dated him first,

36:27.207 --> 36:29.273
then I broke up with him first,
then she started to date him.

36:29.273 --> 36:31.339
Then like loads of other people
started to date him.

36:31.339 --> 36:33.174
And then, I was like,
"Oh my God, am I crazy

36:33.174 --> 36:34.768
for breaking up with this guy?"

36:34.768 --> 36:36.768
And they’re all having
this really sexy and exciting

36:36.768 --> 36:38.999
polyamorous relationship
and I’m just like... Ugh.

36:38.999 --> 36:40.306
You know, like ugh,
like Plain Jane.

36:41.405 --> 36:44.075
And then, we decided
to invite her

36:44.075 --> 36:46.339
into our polyamorous relationship.

36:46.339 --> 36:48.306
Right, you did. Thank you.

36:48.306 --> 36:50.042
And weirdly...

36:50.042 --> 36:51.867
I don’t know, it just...

36:51.867 --> 36:55.339
I think it really worked for me.
So, it was like, me,

36:55.339 --> 37:00.174
him and her, all together,
and loads more people.

37:00.471 --> 37:01.867
Why not me?

37:02.966 --> 37:06.372
The thing is, there’s just...
some unsavoury people.

37:06.372 --> 37:08.867
Okay, not that I think
that polyamory is unsavoury,

37:08.867 --> 37:10.306
because I don’t.

37:10.306 --> 37:13.339
Well, there are some people
who don’t have respect

37:13.339 --> 37:17.273
for polyamory and they tend
to get a little aggressive.

37:17.273 --> 37:19.339
Not aggressive, confused. Confused.

37:19.339 --> 37:22.801
Some of them have been known
to show up armed.

37:23.999 --> 37:25.306
Seriously?

37:25.306 --> 37:28.933
So, if I want to walk a guest
to the door,

37:29.372 --> 37:31.339
I would make sure
they take me seriously.

37:35.108 --> 37:36.504
Yeah.

37:37.207 --> 37:38.306
Okay.

37:44.240 --> 37:46.306
Here she is.

37:46.306 --> 37:47.801
Wow.

37:48.768 --> 37:50.834
Yeah, well, 3K should do it.

37:53.834 --> 37:55.339
Show me the money.

37:55.339 --> 37:57.768
Okay, okay.
Hang on a second.

37:57.768 --> 38:01.801
Why are you guys inviting people
with guns to your sexy soirées?

38:01.801 --> 38:05.471
Like, can’t you figure out
a way to vet them in advance?

38:07.405 --> 38:08.966
Your body, your choice!

38:08.966 --> 38:10.240
Yes.

38:10.834 --> 38:11.999
It is.

38:11.999 --> 38:13.339
I get it.

38:13.867 --> 38:17.273
It’s a cover story.
This isn’t real, got it.

38:17.900 --> 38:19.438
What do you mean, cover story?

38:20.471 --> 38:22.306
I didn’t say cover!

38:22.306 --> 38:25.141
Jeff, I said...

38:25.141 --> 38:27.900
Lover! I mean,
lover of guns, clearly!

38:27.900 --> 38:29.240
Are you a rat?
- No!

38:32.339 --> 38:35.504
GTPD, drop the gun now!

38:36.801 --> 38:38.867
Purse pistol against
a machine gun? I like my odds.

38:38.867 --> 38:41.207
How about two purse pistols
versus your machine gun?

38:41.999 --> 38:43.471
Put it down slowly.

38:49.999 --> 38:51.339
Thanks a lot.

38:52.339 --> 38:54.570
Slow, get your hands up.

39:02.966 --> 39:04.372
At your back, Kelly.

39:07.174 --> 39:09.306
Hands behind your head, Jeff.
You’re under arrest.

39:11.273 --> 39:12.405
Ow!

39:19.240 --> 39:21.504
Do you know what kind
of charges you’re facing?

39:22.900 --> 39:24.966
I mean, considering
my immaculate record

39:24.966 --> 39:27.306
and the fact that
it’s a first offence, I mean...

39:28.273 --> 39:29.471
Please.

39:29.471 --> 39:31.570
Alright, listen
to me very carefully.

39:31.570 --> 39:33.075
Alright?

39:33.999 --> 39:37.438
This Purple Rain stuff,
it’s lethal.

39:37.438 --> 39:41.108
If that kid Ray dies,
you’re looking at manslaughter.

39:41.108 --> 39:42.207
Oh.

39:44.075 --> 39:45.207
Uh...

39:46.306 --> 39:49.999
Well, if I give you my supplier,

39:49.999 --> 39:52.372
could that help
lighten the sentence?

39:53.042 --> 39:55.405
Well, it definitely wouldn’t
hurt.

39:56.372 --> 39:59.174
Okay, so... I get the product

39:59.174 --> 40:01.537
through a network of gamers
called The Replicants.

40:01.537 --> 40:04.207
They sell exclusively through
an online chat room.

40:04.207 --> 40:06.108
Battlebender.
- Yeah.

40:06.108 --> 40:07.537
But then, a few days ago,

40:07.537 --> 40:08.933
the whole operation
went offline.

40:08.933 --> 40:11.405
So, I was about to meet
with my contact,

40:11.405 --> 40:13.372
Jake Mardy,

40:13.372 --> 40:15.966
and he was going to tell me
how things are moving,

40:15.966 --> 40:17.537
now that the game’s been
shut down.

40:17.537 --> 40:19.141
Jake Mardy?

40:28.108 --> 40:31.042
Hey. That was a crazy day.

40:31.042 --> 40:33.240
Yeah.

40:35.306 --> 40:37.537
I know we haven’t had
a lot of alone time,

40:37.999 --> 40:40.108
and Tueli is not helping that.

40:41.141 --> 40:44.273
And I cannot put her out.

40:44.273 --> 40:45.933
I’ve known her since
she was a baby. So--

40:45.933 --> 40:49.108
No, I... I get it.

40:49.999 --> 40:52.471
So, will you come home
with me tonight?

40:52.999 --> 40:56.405
I don’t know. Are you gonna
invite me to your next dinner

40:56.405 --> 40:58.438
with Tueli and Vanessa?

41:02.702 --> 41:06.108
Yeah. Caught wind
of your date night.

41:06.108 --> 41:07.933
Unfortunately,
it didn’t come from you, though.

41:07.933 --> 41:10.933
Kell, I have seen them
literally three or four times,

41:10.933 --> 41:12.537
tops, in the last six months,

41:12.537 --> 41:15.108
because Tueli is coming to
school here in town. That’s it.

41:15.108 --> 41:17.603
Yeah, so when I asked you
if you had anything else

41:17.603 --> 41:20.240
to tell me, you didn’t think
this was a thing?

41:20.240 --> 41:22.207
No, I guess I didn’t think
it was a thing.

41:22.207 --> 41:24.504
Nathan, you know
I have trust issues.

41:24.504 --> 41:26.702
It doesn’t take much
for me to turtle.

41:26.702 --> 41:28.570
Is that what’s happening now?

41:28.570 --> 41:30.174
Are you turtling on me?

41:30.174 --> 41:31.702
All I’m saying is...

41:35.669 --> 41:39.240
I’m gonna spend another night
at my friend’s house.

41:39.603 --> 41:40.966
Bye.
- Kell--

41:41.273 --> 41:43.669
I’m sorry, Kelly...

41:53.306 --> 41:56.372
Who goes there?
I’m just kidding, come in.

41:56.372 --> 41:57.702
Hey, how are you doing?

41:58.801 --> 42:01.669
Hmm. I’m fine. I’m in
my pajamas, my underwear, socks.

42:01.669 --> 42:04.141
I’ve never been so grateful
to be fully clothed.

42:04.669 --> 42:09.240
I just wanted to say thank you
for letting me crash here.

42:09.240 --> 42:11.273
Are you kidding me?
I love this.

42:11.273 --> 42:12.603
Hey, wait, are you tired?

42:12.603 --> 42:14.240
Hmm, not really.

42:17.075 --> 42:20.042
Come on, come on, come on.
I have been craving this

42:20.042 --> 42:21.603
since Dack Adams
talked about it yesterday.

42:21.603 --> 42:24.273
He described a gory murder
scene and your takeaway

42:24.273 --> 42:26.735
from that was, "Damn, I gotta
get me some of those chips"?

42:26.735 --> 42:28.570
Oh my God, like,
it wasn’t that gory.

42:28.570 --> 42:30.372
Come on, we’ll watch
Bridgerton season two.

42:32.669 --> 42:33.999
Alright, move your ass
on over.

42:33.999 --> 42:36.108
Yes! Yes.

42:39.372 --> 42:41.273
Hey, are you okay?

42:42.438 --> 42:45.669
Yeah, I’m fine, you know,
it’s just... Men.

42:46.108 --> 42:47.768
Oh, men.

42:47.768 --> 42:49.306
You know what? And women.

42:49.306 --> 42:52.372
Ugh! Really, right?
And people, really.

42:52.372 --> 42:54.735
People.

42:55.141 --> 42:57.306
- Blah!
- Not to mention this job.

42:57.306 --> 42:59.999
Oh my God, I can’t even talk
about work right now.

43:00.339 --> 43:02.174
Okay, everything
just makes me sick.

43:02.174 --> 43:05.570
Yeah, me too.
Except for these chips and you.

43:34.339 --> 43:35.669
difuze
