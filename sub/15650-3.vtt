MAKE SUCH A BIG DEAL

03:54.275 --> 03:55.818
ABOUT GOING OUT FOR HALLOWEEN?

03:55.902 --> 03:57.695
I'M SORRY, FELLAS.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.822
IT ALL GOES
BACK TO MY CHILDHOOD

AND MY CRAZY AUNT GRETCHEN.

04:05.495 --> 04:09.123
All:
CRAZY AUNT GRETCHEN.

Filburt:
WHEN I WAS JUST A SHELL-BOY

04:12.293 --> 04:16.005
MY PARENTS LOVED TO GO
TO PARTIES ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT.

04:16.089 --> 04:18.507
WHICH WAS FINE, EXCEPT...

04:18.591 --> 04:21.928
EVERY YEAR, THEY WOULD
LEAVE ME ALONE WITH...

04:22.011 --> 04:25.556
CRAZY AUNT GRETCHEN.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.433
(<i> chattering</i> )

04:27.517 --> 04:29.978
SHE WAS RAISED IN AN AQUARIUM

04:30.061 --> 04:31.980
BUT REFUSED TO EVER COME OUT.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.940
SO SHE GREW INTO IT.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.317
SHE HATED HALLOWEEN.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.153
{\an1}AND ALL NIGHT SHE TOLD ME
TERRIFYING STORIES.

04:39.237 --> 04:43.074
BUT THE WORST THING SHE TOLD ME

04:43.157 --> 04:45.535
WAS THAT CANDY WAS POISON

04:45.618 --> 04:48.871
AND IF I EVEN TOUCHED ONE PIECE

04:48.955 --> 04:52.166
THE HOPPING HESSIAN
WOULD COME AND TAKE ME AWAY.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.419
(<i> screaming</i> )

04:57.380 --> 05:01.134
AND THAT'S WHY
I'M AFRAID OF HALLOWEEN.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.885
VERY SCARY.

05:02.969 --> 05:03.928
{\an1}I'LL SAY.
LET'S GO.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.139
OH, NO, I WON'T DO IT.
