04:58.602 --> 05:01.674
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

05:02.443 --> 05:05.003
It's all right. I'm not gonna hurt you.

05:05.283 --> 05:06.398
What do you want?

05:06.483 --> 05:07.313
I thought you were...

05:07.403 --> 05:08.438
What?

05:09.324 --> 05:10.643
I don't know.

05:21.885 --> 05:24.480
Help! Help!

05:27.726 --> 05:29.796
Help! Help!

05:33.367 --> 05:34.402
Stop!

05:40.368 --> 05:44.281
- What? What?
- It's okay. Come here.

06:03.691 --> 06:06.570
It's okay. Calm down.
Everything's gonna be fine.

06:06.732 --> 06:07.847
What was in there?

06:08.052 --> 06:09.883
Just gimme a minute
to figure things out.

06:09.972 --> 06:12.851
- Why were you afraid of that room?
- Gimme a minute I said.

06:18.293 --> 06:20.330
How many people are in this thing?

06:22.694 --> 06:25.527
Listen. We can't go
climbing around in here.

06:25.774 --> 06:26.844
Why not?

06:28.695 --> 06:31.129
- There are traps.
- What do you mean traps?

06:31.255 --> 06:34.293
Booby traps. I looked
into a room down there and

06:34.376 --> 06:36.048
something almost cut my head off.

06:40.256 --> 06:44.569
Holy cats. Holy, holy cats.

07:03.060 --> 07:05.779
You alright? Mister?

07:08.420 --> 07:09.171
Worth!

07:14.301 --> 07:15.051
Don't worry.

07:21.142 --> 07:22.018
I hit my head.

07:22.342 --> 07:26.734
Let me take a look at that.
I'm a doctor. It doesn't look that bad.

07:30.624 --> 07:32.103
What the hell are you doing?

07:44.946 --> 07:47.460
Hey, old man,
did you hear what I said?

08:07.469 --> 08:11.428
Motion detectors. Integrated
into the walls. Tough to spot.

08:13.070 --> 08:16.028
Oh god, oh god, oh god.

08:19.350 --> 08:22.548
Wait a second.
Let's all just relax for a minute.

08:24.671 --> 08:26.582
Does anybody remember
how they got here?

08:34.433 --> 08:35.422
Perogies.

08:39.153 --> 08:40.302
I was eating dinner.

08:40.833 --> 08:42.062
Perogies. Cheese and potatoes.

08:42.154 --> 08:44.714
I ran out of sour cream and then
I went to the fridge and then...

08:45.754 --> 08:46.584
I don't know.

08:47.714 --> 08:50.309
You? Leaven?

08:51.955 --> 08:55.266
I, I just went to bed and...

08:57.996 --> 08:58.985
What about you?

09:01.076 --> 09:02.590
I just woke up here.

09:02.877 --> 09:03.992
Middle of the night.

09:04.757 --> 09:07.191
It's like Chile. They always come
in the middle of the night.

09:08.237 --> 09:09.068
Who?

09:09.158 --> 09:11.626
Only the goverment could build
something this ugly.

09:11.718 --> 09:12.787
It ain't government.

09:12.878 --> 09:15.153
- Then what is it?
- I don't know.

09:16.479 --> 09:17.673
Aliens.

09:22.079 --> 09:24.196
Please.
We're spooked enough as it is.

09:24.280 --> 09:28.796
Let's rule out aliens for now and
concentrate on what we know.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.029
My mom's gonna freak.

09:30.761 --> 09:31.511
Rennes?

09:32.401 --> 09:35.950
- I just won't be there. They'll freak.
- What do you think, Rennes?

09:36.721 --> 09:38.997
We won't solve jack shit sittin' still.

09:39.322 --> 09:41.472
I'm moving in a straight line
'till I get to the end.

09:42.042 --> 09:43.521
All right, I tend to agree.

09:43.882 --> 09:46.158
- Shouldn't we wait here?
- For what?

09:46.563 --> 09:47.996
To see if anybody comes.

09:48.283 --> 09:49.477
No one is gonna come.

09:49.643 --> 09:53.353
Look. There is a way in here,
so there's gotta be a way out.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.875
We can avoid
the traps using the boot.

09:56.404 --> 09:59.715
Holloway is it?
What do you think? Look for an exit?

10:00.445 --> 10:01.241
Okay.

10:02.245 --> 10:03.314
What about you?

10:03.565 --> 10:06.763
- It can't be that simple.
- It won't be that simple.

10:07.446 --> 10:10.722
Look around.
Take a good long looksee.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.682
'Cause I got a feeling
it's looking at us.

10:22.528 --> 10:24.086
I just want to wake up.

10:30.809 --> 10:33.482
Leaven. We can do this.

10:34.130 --> 10:37.122
We just have to stay calm
and work together as a team.

10:38.810 --> 10:41.484
There's gonna be a lot of people
looking for us on the outside.

10:42.051 --> 10:42.961
I'm a cop.

10:43.731 --> 10:44.641
All right?

10:46.091 --> 10:47.604
- You're a cop?
- Yeah.

10:48.692 --> 10:50.762
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I promise.

10:51.612 --> 10:53.284
You gotta be with me on this one.

10:58.333 --> 10:59.083
Okay.

11:10.495 --> 11:11.484
Boot it!

11:19.176 --> 11:20.006
Clean.

11:39.139 --> 11:40.572
That one sounded closer.

11:41.139 --> 11:43.653
It's mechanical. It seems
to come at regular intervals.

11:44.019 --> 11:45.817
Maybe it's the ventilation system.

11:46.020 --> 11:48.580
- No vents.
- No kidding, I'm boiling.

11:52.061 --> 11:52.937
What is it?

11:56.261 --> 11:57.330
Serial numbers?

11:57.661 --> 12:00.301
Room numbers.
They're different in each room.

12:00.782 --> 12:04.695
Oh great. There are only 566 millions
400 thousand rooms in this thing.

12:04.782 --> 12:06.057
Well, there better not be?

12:06.143 --> 12:08.179
We have about 3 days
without food and water

12:08.263 --> 12:10.174
before we are too weak to move.

12:10.503 --> 12:12.141
Well, they have to feed us,
don't they?

12:13.504 --> 12:14.539
Holloway.

12:14.624 --> 12:19.540
Oh, we have heat, stress, physical
exsection, i.e., dehydratation,

12:19.625 --> 12:22.856
headaches, dizziness, disorientation,
confused mental processes.

12:22.945 --> 12:25.743
The body eventually begins
to break down its own tissue.

12:27.466 --> 12:28.740
Suck on it.

12:32.426 --> 12:34.224
Keeps the saliva flowing.

12:51.909 --> 12:54.104
- What?
- The air seems dry in there.

12:54.389 --> 12:55.300
Trapped?

12:55.590 --> 12:57.421
Molecular chemical sensor.

12:57.550 --> 12:59.506
Why the hell didn't
the boot set it off?

12:59.670 --> 13:00.864
The boot's not alive.

13:01.430 --> 13:04.264
Detects hydrogen sulphide
excreted from the skin.

13:04.671 --> 13:06.821
How is it you know
so much about sensors, Renz?

13:11.832 --> 13:16.145
Renn. Not Renz. It's French.

13:16.313 --> 13:18.304
Fine, you're French.
I'm asking how you...

13:21.233 --> 13:24.112
Renn. Sensor expert,

13:24.194 --> 13:25.343
about the right age.

13:26.154 --> 13:27.382
I don't believe it.

13:30.915 --> 13:33.383
- This guy is the Wren.
- The what?

13:33.675 --> 13:37.589
He's the Wren. The Bird of Attica.
Flew the coop on 6 major prisons.

13:38.076 --> 13:39.065
Seven.

13:39.196 --> 13:40.914
You're kidding, right?

13:41.796 --> 13:42.990
You can get us out.

13:43.196 --> 13:44.152
Maybe.

13:44.717 --> 13:46.275
An escape artist.

13:46.357 --> 13:48.188
Yeah, I'm Harry fucking Houdini.

13:50.397 --> 13:52.832
The only reason I dragged you
this far is 'cause I need your boots.

13:53.558 --> 13:55.947
If you don't smarten up,
I'll be gone like that.

13:57.278 --> 13:58.507
No more talking.

13:59.679 --> 14:00.907
No more guessing.

14:01.839 --> 14:04.990
Don't even think about nothing
that's not right in front of you.

14:05.680 --> 14:07.477
That's the real challenge.

14:08.800 --> 14:11.268
You got to save yourselves
from yourselves.

14:20.842 --> 14:21.718
Merde.

14:31.283 --> 14:32.557
Get him out!

15:05.848 --> 15:07.042
Oh my god!

15:14.929 --> 15:19.560
So, it was electro chemical or
whatever, right? And he missed it.

15:20.330 --> 15:23.721
The Wren. That's great!
That's fuckin' great!

15:35.772 --> 15:39.243
All right. It's time
to reassess this place.

15:39.493 --> 15:41.723
I've been over it again and again.

15:41.853 --> 15:43.844
Why would they throw
innocent people in here?

15:43.933 --> 15:45.333
Are we being punished?

15:46.214 --> 15:48.603
I've never done anything
to deserve this.

15:49.054 --> 15:50.203
Forget about all that!

15:51.455 --> 15:54.094
You can't see the big picture
from in here, so don't try.

15:54.335 --> 15:55.893
Keep your head down.
Keep it simple.

15:56.055 --> 15:58.125
Just look at what's in front of you.

15:58.216 --> 15:59.285
That's what he said.

15:59.896 --> 16:03.855
Start with us.
We got an escape artist and a cop.

16:04.096 --> 16:05.211
There's gotta be a reason for that.

16:05.937 --> 16:09.646
You're doctor, Holloway. It gives you
a function, a reason, right?

16:10.377 --> 16:11.856
No. It's just makes me go why me

16:11.937 --> 16:14.850
and why not one of the other
10 million doctors out there.

16:21.339 --> 16:23.091
Leaven, what are you?

16:23.459 --> 16:29.456
Nothing. I just go to school.
I hang out with my friends.

16:29.540 --> 16:31.929
- What else?
- There's nothing else.

16:32.940 --> 16:36.570
My parents are these people.
I live with them. I'm boring.

16:36.941 --> 16:40.537
I think we have to ask
the big questions.

16:40.662 --> 16:41.981
What does it want?

16:42.102 --> 16:43.740
What is it thinking?

16:44.502 --> 16:46.060
One down, four to go.

16:50.663 --> 16:52.813
Why don't you tell us
what your purpose is, Worth?

16:53.023 --> 16:54.536
Often wondered that myself.

17:00.104 --> 17:01.332
I'm just a guy.

17:01.705 --> 17:04.583
I work in an office building,
doing office building stuff.

17:05.105 --> 17:09.622
I wasn't exactly bursting with
"joie de vivre" before I got here.

17:09.705 --> 17:11.263
Life just sucks in general.

17:11.425 --> 17:14.656
- I can't stand that attitude.
- Because he's right.

17:15.386 --> 17:17.502
What's your purpose, Quentin?

17:22.347 --> 17:24.816
Kids, three of them.

17:26.308 --> 17:27.707
I haven't made my peace yet.

17:29.668 --> 17:31.580
I'm getting out of here,
no matter what.

17:31.749 --> 17:33.626
That's where
my strength comes from.

17:34.269 --> 17:36.100
You, people,
find yours wherever you got it.

17:37.510 --> 17:39.387
For Christ's sake, Worth.
What do you live for?

17:39.470 --> 17:41.620
Don't you have a wife or
a girlfriend, or something?

17:41.830 --> 17:44.026
No. I've got a pretty fine
collection of pornography.

17:44.591 --> 17:46.707
Oh, nice, nice.

17:48.431 --> 17:51.902
I haven't got anybody either, but
I'm not giving up! I am pissed off.

17:52.192 --> 17:53.511
They came into our homes!

17:53.832 --> 17:57.905
They stripped us bare.
They took my rings, they took...

17:58.753 --> 18:00.709
...oh, my amethyst.

18:04.393 --> 18:06.066
I wanna know who's responsible.

18:07.114 --> 18:09.503
Leaven. Your glasses?

18:11.754 --> 18:12.744
You don't need them?

18:13.675 --> 18:14.744
They're for reading.

18:17.235 --> 18:21.195
Well they took off our jewelry,
but why they put these on you.

18:22.636 --> 18:23.705
If nothing is random,

18:24.716 --> 18:25.751
why are they here?

18:32.237 --> 18:36.948
Leaven. What do you do
in school? Math?

18:41.999 --> 18:43.148
What can they mean?

18:53.520 --> 18:54.749
149.

19:10.043 --> 19:13.592
Prime numbers. I can't believe
I didn't see it before.

19:13.843 --> 19:14.639
See what?

19:14.923 --> 19:17.358
It seems like, if any
of these numbers are prime,

19:17.484 --> 19:18.473
then the room's trapped.

19:21.964 --> 19:25.674
645, 645... That's not prime.

19:26.445 --> 19:28.834
372... no.

19:30.286 --> 19:32.436
649...

19:33.486 --> 19:35.875
Well, 11 times 59.
It's not prime either.

19:38.247 --> 19:39.680
So that room is safe.

19:40.247 --> 19:41.077
Wait.

19:41.167 --> 19:44.285
How can you make that assumption
based on one prime number trap?

19:44.368 --> 19:48.361
I'm not. The incinerator thing
was prime 083.

19:49.008 --> 19:52.365
The molecular chemical thing had
137. The acid room had 149.

19:52.529 --> 19:53.757
You remember all that in your head?

19:53.969 --> 19:55.243
I have a facility for it.

19:56.049 --> 20:00.566
Leaven, you beautiful brain.

20:02.090 --> 20:02.806
Boot it.

20:06.971 --> 20:08.199
Okay, out of the way.

20:08.531 --> 20:09.884
Brains before beauty.

20:16.052 --> 20:18.327
Safe, safe.

20:20.213 --> 20:23.489
Prime numbers! Prime numbers!

20:32.094 --> 20:34.290
Oh, how long have we been in here?

20:36.415 --> 20:37.643
Nine or ten hours.

20:40.135 --> 20:41.012
How do you know?

20:42.736 --> 20:46.968
Five o'clock shadow. Last thing
I remember was shaving.

20:48.657 --> 20:51.376
I guess
I missed breakfast or lunch...

20:52.017 --> 20:53.166
or whatever.

20:55.458 --> 20:58.052
Don't worry.
I'll be home in time for dinner.

21:00.858 --> 21:03.054
If we get out, I'll make you dinner.

21:05.099 --> 21:06.327
You got a date.

21:24.542 --> 21:25.497
Doin' good.

21:39.664 --> 21:42.974
I need to smoke.
I'd smoke a butt off a sidewalk.

21:43.624 --> 21:46.822
Holloway.
Just reel yourself in a bit. Come on.

21:47.105 --> 21:48.697
We're moving along.
Things are looking up.

21:48.865 --> 21:51.903
Ok, ok. You are right.
I quit smoking years ago.

21:53.666 --> 21:54.940
I just need to be occupied.

21:55.306 --> 21:58.538
Talk then. Have a conversation.
What kind of doctor are you anyway?

21:59.187 --> 22:00.859
Oh, you know, the free kind.

22:04.988 --> 22:07.377
Come on. Help me.
Tell me about your rug rats.

22:08.828 --> 22:12.663
We have three boys. 9, 7 and 5.

22:13.229 --> 22:16.904
Good God. Poor woman.
There's no way I'd survive that.

22:18.709 --> 22:19.779
She didn't either.

22:22.350 --> 22:24.545
She's not dead,
we're just separated.

22:26.471 --> 22:29.304
I'm sorry.
I can't just shoot the breeze.

22:31.191 --> 22:32.544
These numbers aren't prime.

22:32.631 --> 22:34.304
Okay, clear.

22:38.832 --> 22:40.106
Excuse me, sorry.

22:45.673 --> 22:48.393
You, could try and
help me out here, buddy.

22:48.874 --> 22:49.909
No, I couldn't.

22:58.995 --> 23:00.587
This one's trapped too.

23:06.396 --> 23:07.875
We have to backtrack?

23:11.397 --> 23:12.432
Not yet.

23:18.958 --> 23:19.947
Read them to me.

23:33.240 --> 23:36.277
- What are you, his coat rack?
- Oh, please!

23:47.322 --> 23:48.311
It's stuck.

23:51.203 --> 23:51.919
Look out.

23:59.684 --> 24:01.083
This room is green.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.480
Holloway?

24:15.286 --> 24:16.082
Hi there.

24:20.567 --> 24:22.159
This room is green.

24:22.807 --> 24:23.683
Yes, it is.

24:25.887 --> 24:27.765
I wanna go back to the blue room.

24:29.368 --> 24:30.642
What is it? Shock or what?

24:31.208 --> 24:32.880
I think he's mentally handicapped.

24:33.649 --> 24:34.968
I like the blue room.

24:36.329 --> 24:39.685
- Jesus Christ.
- He almost broke my neck.

24:40.370 --> 24:44.124
Hey there, are you all alone?
You want to hold my hand, honey?

24:45.050 --> 24:48.361
Butter first, then honey, Kazan.
Butter first, then honey...

24:48.491 --> 24:52.530
- How'd he survive?
- I want to go back to the blue room.

24:52.891 --> 24:55.486
There's lots of blue rooms.
We'll find you another real soon.

24:56.852 --> 24:58.171
This is just way too bizarre.

24:59.132 --> 25:01.248
Well, you just worry
about your numbers then.

25:03.733 --> 25:05.291
Go on. I'll look after him.

25:09.094 --> 25:12.404
Safe. Obviously,
since he almost fell on my head.

25:12.654 --> 25:15.692
Should we go for a walk, Kazan?

25:16.695 --> 25:17.844
You want to go for a walk?

25:31.657 --> 25:33.807
Let's not make him do
the climbing thing right away.

25:34.017 --> 25:34.847
Holloway...

25:35.937 --> 25:36.927
Hol-Io-way.

25:41.898 --> 25:44.208
Could they have taken us
all the way to New Mexico?

25:44.339 --> 25:45.738
What are you
talking about, Holloway?

25:47.139 --> 25:49.573
I'm talking about where do you
hide something this big.

25:50.259 --> 25:51.773
At least he's good for something.

25:55.860 --> 25:57.452
I'm sorry to shake
your foundations, Quentin,

25:57.580 --> 25:59.856
but you have no idea
where your tax dollars go.

26:00.541 --> 26:02.133
Free clinic doctors?

26:02.821 --> 26:05.097
Only the military
industrial complex could afford

26:05.182 --> 26:06.820
to build something this size.

26:06.942 --> 26:10.412
Holloway, what is
the military industrial complex?

26:10.502 --> 26:11.821
Have you ever been there?

26:11.903 --> 26:13.382
I'm telling you,
it's not that complex.

26:13.503 --> 26:15.141
How would you know
from where you are?

26:16.183 --> 26:18.174
Who do you think
the establishment is?

26:18.263 --> 26:19.492
It's just guys like me.

26:19.864 --> 26:22.014
Their desks are bigger,
but their jobs are't.

26:22.104 --> 26:23.981
They don't conspire...
they buy boats.

26:24.704 --> 26:27.538
No, this place is...
remember Scaramanga?

26:28.385 --> 26:30.296
The bad guy in
"The Man With The Golden Gun".

26:32.545 --> 26:34.741
It's some rich
psycho's entertainment.

26:37.666 --> 26:38.781
Is that what you think?

26:39.826 --> 26:40.623
Clear.

26:51.188 --> 26:53.099
Ok. You are a cop.

26:54.229 --> 26:57.107
Single bullet theory. Right on.

27:07.110 --> 27:09.671
- Gas!
- Holloway, get back here!

27:14.311 --> 27:17.588
It's okay.
I just swallowed my button.

27:22.272 --> 27:23.752
I hate this. I hate this.

27:28.593 --> 27:30.710
Your boy is having
a conniption fit in there.

27:35.034 --> 27:37.026
It's like cramming without coffee.

27:37.355 --> 27:39.152
- She needs a break.
- She can do it.

27:48.716 --> 27:50.035
They don't look like prime to me.

27:50.516 --> 27:52.667
Is that your two bits worth, Worth?

27:53.637 --> 27:55.070
For what it's worth.

28:00.238 --> 28:05.233
- Well?
- Well, he's right. Not prime.

28:09.719 --> 28:12.439
Stop! In front of you!

28:25.561 --> 28:26.438
What is it?

28:36.243 --> 28:37.358
Shut up!

28:40.764 --> 28:43.198
I don't know what happened.
It wasn't prime.

28:45.444 --> 28:47.036
Quentin, hold still.

28:49.765 --> 28:53.917
- Somebody stops that racket.
- Worth!

28:56.886 --> 28:58.080
Leave the boots.

29:07.447 --> 29:09.279
And shut the fucking door!

29:13.168 --> 29:15.238
I had a feeling
about that fucking guy.

29:16.009 --> 29:17.488
He knew about that trap.

29:18.009 --> 29:19.283
These numbers aren't prime.

29:19.369 --> 29:21.041
Then your number system failed,
but he knew...

29:21.209 --> 29:22.802
Knew what? How would he know?

29:22.930 --> 29:24.443
You are the paranoid one,
think about it.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.998
His only function so far has been
to kick us when we're down.

29:27.090 --> 29:29.889
So he has a bad attitude. Are you
saying, that makes him a spy?

29:30.051 --> 29:32.565
Trust me on this. It's my job
to read people like an X-Ray.

29:37.932 --> 29:39.160
He doesn't like red rooms.

29:47.453 --> 29:48.442
So what happened?

29:49.373 --> 29:51.410
- You saw what happened.
- Quentin!

29:51.814 --> 29:53.566
I guess the numbers are
more complicated that I thought.

29:54.094 --> 29:55.209
Maybe they mean nothing at all.

29:55.534 --> 29:57.206
No. It means
they are more involved.

29:57.695 --> 29:59.333
They've worked for us up 'till now,
haven't they?

29:59.415 --> 30:01.053
I just need more time with them.

30:01.335 --> 30:03.485
Well, we need to rest anyway.

30:04.255 --> 30:07.373
Well. That's handy. 'Cause there's
not a fuck of a lot else we can do.

30:19.978 --> 30:21.809
Are they telling you anything?

30:22.898 --> 30:24.251
They're not tarot cards.

30:26.459 --> 30:29.098
Do you have any idea how many
variables I have to consider

30:29.179 --> 30:31.693
before I can
decipher numbers this size?

30:32.499 --> 30:34.331
They don't reveal
themselves right away.

30:35.540 --> 30:36.609
They're like people.

30:43.061 --> 30:44.733
Oh, gross.

30:47.902 --> 30:50.735
Oh, not here honey.
Over in the corner.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.261
Well, he's just peeing.

31:00.303 --> 31:01.737
Jesus Christ.

31:02.504 --> 31:05.177
That's excellent.
Now it totally reeks in here!

31:07.504 --> 31:09.177
You find this all
pretty funny, don't you?

31:14.585 --> 31:16.417
What's your
fucking problem, Worth?

31:18.066 --> 31:19.943
Even Holloway's
holding up better than you.

31:20.626 --> 31:24.540
Get over there and help her with him.
That's your job. Babysitter.

31:26.787 --> 31:28.266
Jawohl, Kommandant.

31:31.108 --> 31:33.338
Somebody has to take
responsability around here.

31:33.948 --> 31:35.984
And that somebody has to be you.

31:36.228 --> 31:38.026
Not all of us have
the luxury of playing nihilist.

31:38.509 --> 31:41.228
Not all of us are
conceited enough to play hero.

31:43.149 --> 31:44.822
This is a will to live.

31:45.030 --> 31:46.588
Everybody's got it,
Worth, even you.

31:46.710 --> 31:48.940
Especially you,
hiding behind that cynical front.

31:49.470 --> 31:50.425
A will to live.

31:50.871 --> 31:53.339
That's the warm,
cosy feeling deep inside.

31:53.871 --> 31:55.748
Thanks Quentin, I'm a new man.

31:55.991 --> 31:59.302
Oh, poor Worth. Nobody loves me.

31:59.752 --> 32:01.151
If that's the chip
on your shoulder, why

32:01.272 --> 32:02.307
did you lug it all this way?

32:02.592 --> 32:04.105
Why didn't you
just lie down and die?

32:17.554 --> 32:18.543
Do it.

32:19.035 --> 32:21.674
Show us you have some backbone
and jump in the sushi machine.

32:22.035 --> 32:23.150
Be a man.

32:32.316 --> 32:33.466
Thought so.

32:36.117 --> 32:37.516
Fuck you Quentin!

32:40.038 --> 32:42.393
I don't wanna die.
I'm just being realistic.

32:42.478 --> 32:44.230
Do you think they'd go to all
the trouble to build this thing

32:44.318 --> 32:45.387
if we could just walk out?

32:45.478 --> 32:46.593
Do you think
they would have left us clues

32:46.678 --> 32:48.635
and let us beat it so far
if there wasn't a way out?

32:48.719 --> 32:49.947
You think we matter? We don't.

32:50.039 --> 32:52.599
Put us out of your misery so we can
get on with getting out of here.

32:52.679 --> 32:53.999
You're not getting out of here!

32:54.080 --> 32:55.559
- Yes, we are!
- No, you're not!

32:55.640 --> 32:58.598
- Yes, we are!
- There is no way out of here!

33:13.562 --> 33:14.711
Gotchya.

33:20.723 --> 33:24.353
How do you know that?

33:26.844 --> 33:28.277
Answer the question, Worth.

33:30.205 --> 33:32.355
Oh, god.

33:37.046 --> 33:38.161
Who are you?

33:49.087 --> 33:50.487
I'm the poison.

33:52.928 --> 33:54.407
I designed the outer shell.

33:55.288 --> 33:56.323
The what?

33:57.449 --> 33:59.280
The shell. The sarcophagus.

34:00.569 --> 34:02.002
You built this thing?

34:02.089 --> 34:03.317
Not this part. The exterior.

34:03.449 --> 34:06.089
I don't know anything about the
numbers or anything else in here.

34:07.050 --> 34:10.565
I was contracted to draw
plans for a hollow shell.

34:12.011 --> 34:13.080
A cube.

34:13.931 --> 34:16.684
A cube? Why didn't you tell us?

34:17.731 --> 34:20.643
For God's sake, Worth,
you knew what it was.

34:22.492 --> 34:23.607
No.

34:24.492 --> 34:27.212
Worth. You're lying.

34:31.092 --> 34:32.446
Was not at first.

34:33.293 --> 34:34.522
Who's behind it?

34:38.414 --> 34:39.369
I don't know.

34:40.054 --> 34:41.373
Who hired you?

34:43.255 --> 34:44.244
I didn't ask.

34:46.534 --> 34:48.128
I never even left my office.

34:48.896 --> 34:51.126
I talked on the phone to some
people, other guys like me.

34:51.295 --> 34:53.286
Specialists,
working on small details.

34:53.456 --> 34:54.685
Nobody knew what it was.

34:55.377 --> 34:56.446
Nobody cared.

34:56.657 --> 34:59.251
Bullshit.
You knew from square one.

35:00.097 --> 35:03.056
Look at him. He is up
to his eyeballs in this thing.

35:03.178 --> 35:06.295
No, Quentin.
That's how they stay hidden.

35:06.818 --> 35:07.887
You keep everyone separated

35:07.978 --> 35:10.334
so the left hand doesn't know
what the right hand is doing.

35:10.459 --> 35:12.529
The brain
never comes out in the open.

35:13.459 --> 35:14.494
Whose brain?

35:15.980 --> 35:18.130
It's all the same machine, right!

35:18.260 --> 35:21.889
The Pentagone, multinational
corporations, the police.

35:22.501 --> 35:26.176
If you do one little job,
you build a widget in Saskatoon,

35:26.301 --> 35:28.576
and the next thing you know
it's two miles under

35:28.701 --> 35:31.739
the desert, the essential
component of a death machine.

35:32.422 --> 35:35.220
I was right.
All along, my whole life,

35:35.342 --> 35:37.538
I knew it. I told you, Quentin.

35:37.663 --> 35:40.018
Nobody's every gonna
call me paranoid again.

35:40.183 --> 35:42.981
We gotta get out of here and
blow the lid of this thing!

35:49.104 --> 35:51.096
Holloway, you don't get it.

35:51.905 --> 35:54.214
Then help me,
please, I need to know.

35:55.625 --> 35:57.263
This may be hard
for you to understand,

35:57.345 --> 35:59.018
but there's no conspiracy.

35:59.466 --> 36:00.865
Nobody is in charge.

36:01.386 --> 36:05.699
It's a headless blunder operating
under the illusion of a master plan.

36:06.027 --> 36:07.096
Can you grasp that?

36:07.547 --> 36:09.538
Big brother is not watching you.

36:11.908 --> 36:13.819
What kind of
fuckin' explanation is that?

36:13.948 --> 36:15.142
It's the best you are gonna get.

36:15.228 --> 36:16.980
I looked, and the only conclusion
I could come to is that

36:17.148 --> 36:18.501
there is nobody up there.

36:18.629 --> 36:20.665
Somebody had to say
yes to this thing.

36:20.749 --> 36:22.580
What thing?
Only we know what it is.

36:22.669 --> 36:25.662
- We have no idea what it is.
- We know more than anybody else.

36:26.070 --> 36:28.026
I mean, somebody might have
known sometime before they go,

36:28.110 --> 36:30.544
they got fired, or
voted out, or sold it,

36:30.910 --> 36:32.468
but if this place
ever had a purpose,

36:32.550 --> 36:34.940
and it got miscommunicated,
or lost in a shuffle.

36:35.271 --> 36:36.545
I mean, this is and accident,

36:36.631 --> 36:39.908
a forgotten perpetual
public works project.

36:40.152 --> 36:41.744
Do you think anybody
wants to ask questions?

36:41.992 --> 36:44.028
All they want is
a clear conscience,

36:44.152 --> 36:45.346
and a fat paycheck.

36:45.712 --> 36:47.351
I leaned on my shovel
for months on this one.

36:47.473 --> 36:48.792
This was a great job!

36:51.113 --> 36:52.592
Why put people in it?

36:53.593 --> 36:57.473
Because it's here. You have
to use it or you admit it's pointless.

36:57.594 --> 36:59.664
But it is pointless.

37:01.315 --> 37:03.192
Quentin. That's my point.

37:04.595 --> 37:06.233
What have we come to?

37:07.715 --> 37:09.786
It's so much worse than I thought.

37:10.956 --> 37:13.675
Not really. Just more pathetic.

37:14.596 --> 37:16.633
You make me sick, Worth.

37:17.037 --> 37:18.675
I make me sick too.

37:19.517 --> 37:20.950
We're both part of the system.

37:21.517 --> 37:24.874
I drew a box, you walk a beat.
It's like you said, Quentin,

37:24.998 --> 37:26.795
is keep your head down,
keep it simple,

37:26.918 --> 37:28.271
just look at what's in front of you.

37:28.398 --> 37:30.117
I mean, nobody wants to see
the big picture.

37:30.359 --> 37:31.587
Life's too complicated.

37:32.359 --> 37:37.195
I mean, let's face it, the reason
we're here is that it's out of control.

37:49.281 --> 37:51.193
This is how we ruin the world?

37:51.882 --> 37:56.080
Well, have you been on glue
all your lives?

37:56.682 --> 38:00.073
I've felt guilty for ruining
the world since I was like 7.

38:01.083 --> 38:04.554
God, if you need someone
to blame, throw a rock.

38:11.525 --> 38:12.640
Well, I feel better.

38:13.965 --> 38:15.523
That's why you stayed with us.

38:16.885 --> 38:18.113
To confess.

38:32.207 --> 38:34.722
You still looking
for someone to bust, Quentin?

38:44.409 --> 38:46.320
Quentin! Stop it! Stop it!

38:48.050 --> 38:49.199
We need him.

38:51.650 --> 38:52.605
What for?

38:52.850 --> 38:54.728
Have you gone absolutely mad?

38:54.851 --> 38:57.160
He's the only one who knows
anything about the place.

39:08.973 --> 39:11.851
- Worth.
- Hi.

39:12.613 --> 39:15.447
- So there's this outer shell.
- Yeah.

39:15.614 --> 39:19.323
- And it's a cube, right? Like this.
- I assume so.

39:19.534 --> 39:22.129
- Are there any doors?
- There's one door.

39:22.215 --> 39:24.524
- Where?
- Wherever the door guy put it.

39:25.135 --> 39:27.649
Six guesses, and
it's sealed from the outside.

39:28.615 --> 39:31.528
And, what are the dimensions
of the outer shell?

39:33.496 --> 39:35.407
434 square feet.

39:44.858 --> 39:45.893
May I?

39:45.978 --> 39:47.775
Come on, honey, slide over.

39:53.379 --> 39:55.574
14 by 14 by 14.

39:55.819 --> 39:58.778
The inner cube can't be flush
with the shell wall, there's a space.

39:59.460 --> 40:00.336
One cube?

40:00.700 --> 40:02.053
I don't know, it makes sense.

40:03.380 --> 40:08.580
Ok. The biggest the cube
can be then is...

40:09.261 --> 40:12.538
26 rooms high,
26 rooms across, so...

40:12.982 --> 40:15.291
17.576 rooms.

40:15.782 --> 40:19.332
Seventeen thousand, five hundred
and seventy-six rooms?

40:21.823 --> 40:23.222
That makes me queasy.

40:27.104 --> 40:28.173
Descartes!

40:30.784 --> 40:33.902
- Leaven, you are a genius.
- What? What?

40:34.545 --> 40:38.538
Cartesian coordinates. Of course,
coded cartesian coordinates.

40:38.825 --> 40:41.659
They're used in geometry to plot
points on a 3-dimensional graph.

40:42.066 --> 40:43.818
In English, slower.

40:44.466 --> 40:47.584
Bonjour?
These numbers are markers,

40:47.827 --> 40:50.625
and grid reference, like latitude
and longitude on a map.

40:50.947 --> 40:53.620
The numbers tell us where
we are inside the cube.

40:53.748 --> 40:55.067
Well, where are we?

40:58.748 --> 40:59.578
It works.

40:59.828 --> 41:03.504
Okay. All I have to do is add
the numbers together.

41:04.109 --> 41:05.827
The X coordinate is 19...

41:06.429 --> 41:10.264
Y is 26 rooms...

41:11.550 --> 41:12.983
So that places us...

41:15.871 --> 41:17.429
...seven rooms from the edge.

41:17.791 --> 41:19.861
All right, let's go.

41:20.231 --> 41:23.941
Just out of curiosity, I mean,
don't hit me again, or anything...

41:24.072 --> 41:25.221
but what are you gonna do
when you get there?

41:25.312 --> 41:26.791
Maybe we can get the door open.

41:28.152 --> 41:31.350
What we need is to do figure out
how to get around the traps.

41:31.433 --> 41:32.627
I'm dealing with that Holloway.

41:32.713 --> 41:34.226
I'm looking for
practical solutions here.

41:34.553 --> 41:36.465
Well, you haven't found any yet.

41:39.914 --> 41:44.272
We cut the risk with the numbers
and the boot. Worth will go in first.

41:44.355 --> 41:47.028
No, he won't Quentin!
We take turns!

41:48.275 --> 41:49.185
Relax.

41:57.437 --> 41:58.506
Room for two in there?

42:04.638 --> 42:05.707
What's the matter?

42:06.158 --> 42:09.389
These coordinates. 14, 27, 14.

42:09.998 --> 42:12.194
- What about 'em?
- They don't make sense.

42:12.639 --> 42:14.550
Assuming the cube is
26 rooms across,

42:14.679 --> 42:16.510
there can't be
a coordinate larger than 26.

42:17.079 --> 42:19.230
If this were right, then
we would be outside of the cube.

42:22.080 --> 42:24.116
No, not outside of the cube.

42:26.001 --> 42:27.673
I guess that means
we're not having dinner.

42:28.441 --> 42:34.517
Trap. Trap. Trap. Trap.

42:36.682 --> 42:37.797
Trap!

42:45.003 --> 42:46.118
Trap!

42:51.204 --> 42:52.353
Sound activated.

43:08.127 --> 43:09.037
Lovely.

43:10.287 --> 43:12.755
How come the sound of the door
opening didn't set it off?

43:13.327 --> 43:14.727
Must be rigged to ignore it.

43:14.808 --> 43:17.402
So that's it. The edge is
surrounded by traps.

43:17.528 --> 43:21.043
Well, I guess we have to backtrack,
and try somewhere else.

43:21.168 --> 43:23.239
Who knows how many detours
we'll have to take.

43:23.849 --> 43:25.521
I say we cross the bitch.

43:25.889 --> 43:27.163
Right!

43:28.169 --> 43:30.206
How many boots do we have left,
Holloway?

43:34.290 --> 43:35.439
Get it off him.

43:36.411 --> 43:38.481
We know how it works.
We just have to be quiet.

43:38.771 --> 43:40.284
That's pretty fucking quiet.

43:40.571 --> 43:43.962
I'm glad you're on side,
Worth, 'cause... you're up.

43:45.492 --> 43:46.641
And he is not coming.

43:47.092 --> 43:48.445
Of course, he is.

43:48.532 --> 43:51.525
- No way.
- We are not leaving him behind.

43:51.653 --> 43:52.722
He's unpredictable.

43:53.093 --> 43:54.572
When we get to the edge,
we can come back for him.

43:54.653 --> 43:56.325
But he'll get somebody killed here.

43:56.653 --> 43:57.643
Am I right?

43:59.734 --> 44:00.883
Shame on you.

44:01.694 --> 44:03.491
Will you look at yourselves?

44:04.695 --> 44:06.174
What have you turned into?

44:06.575 --> 44:10.488
They may have taken our lives away,
but we are still human beings.

44:11.456 --> 44:13.094
That's all we've got left.

44:15.416 --> 44:16.769
We'll come back for him.

44:18.217 --> 44:20.173
That's a lie and you know it.

44:29.978 --> 44:30.933
He'll be quiet.

47:00.680 --> 47:03.148
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna wait for him.

47:03.720 --> 47:05.472
- No.
- You go out, I'm here.

47:05.800 --> 47:06.789
Okay.

47:17.962 --> 47:19.031
This way.

48:59.576 --> 49:02.171
- You fucking fuck!
- That's enough!

49:02.257 --> 49:04.817
- He is a trap!
- Let him go right now!

49:04.897 --> 49:07.411
The law of the jungle!
He is endangering the pack!

49:07.578 --> 49:09.569
Let him go, you Nazi!

49:11.818 --> 49:12.933
What did you call me?

49:13.098 --> 49:15.738
Quentin, you let
that innocent boy go.

49:17.739 --> 49:19.536
You listen to me, woman.

49:20.259 --> 49:23.218
Everyday I mop up
after your bleeding heart.

49:23.820 --> 49:27.449
The only reason you
even exist is because I keep you.

49:28.540 --> 49:29.735
I know your type,

49:30.581 --> 49:33.778
no kids, no man to fuck you.

49:34.301 --> 49:35.940
So you go around outraged,

49:36.262 --> 49:38.492
sticking your nose up
other people's assholes,

49:38.582 --> 49:40.061
sniffing their business!!!

49:42.222 --> 49:44.054
You missed your boat, Holloway.

49:47.023 --> 49:49.378
You're all dried up
inside there, aren't you?

49:50.024 --> 49:51.662
That's your fucking problem.

49:52.464 --> 49:54.659
How dare you say that to her?

49:55.744 --> 49:58.782
You don't know her, Quentin.
None of us know each other here.

49:58.905 --> 50:02.215
- Oh, I do.
- No you don't.

50:02.585 --> 50:04.895
No wonder your wife left you.

50:06.666 --> 50:09.817
All that bottled up anger.

50:11.787 --> 50:13.937
And a thing for young girls.

50:23.868 --> 50:25.382
God help you, Quentin.

50:27.309 --> 50:29.379
Did you smack
your kids around too?

50:43.311 --> 50:47.783
Is anybody besides me interested in
what's on the other side of that door?

50:50.832 --> 50:51.787
Open it.

50:59.113 --> 51:02.231
Door number six? Not number one?
Door number two?

51:03.954 --> 51:05.387
Open the fuckin' thing.

51:07.795 --> 51:11.344
Oh, sunshine.

51:36.119 --> 51:37.108
Night time.

51:37.959 --> 51:39.711
My old friend, the shell.

51:42.159 --> 51:45.038
It's there. Morning!

51:48.440 --> 51:49.270
Hang on to me.

51:57.602 --> 51:58.751
I can't see shit.

52:01.122 --> 52:02.271
Nothin' to hang on to.

52:07.443 --> 52:08.478
We gotta try something.

52:09.083 --> 52:10.516
We gotta see
if the door's over there.

52:12.164 --> 52:13.916
Someone has to swing
over there, and take a look.

52:14.244 --> 52:15.074
Swing?

52:17.004 --> 52:19.394
We make a rope,
out of clothes.

52:20.525 --> 52:22.163
Take 'em off.
I'll tie it around myself.

52:22.845 --> 52:24.039
Ah, yeah, and you're gonna go.

52:24.285 --> 52:26.561
You weight like 500 ponds,
it'll snap in two seconds.

52:27.486 --> 52:28.475
I'm the lightest.

52:29.246 --> 52:30.076
Forget it.

52:30.686 --> 52:31.641
I'll go.

52:32.887 --> 52:34.115
I'm going, Holloway.

52:34.727 --> 52:36.797
She's right Quentin,
you're too heavy.

52:37.127 --> 52:38.719
I'm the lightest after Leaven.

52:39.568 --> 52:41.081
Anyway, it's my turn.

52:47.369 --> 52:50.202
How long did you know
people were being put in here?

52:51.089 --> 52:52.317
A couple of months.

52:53.049 --> 52:54.278
That's not long,

52:54.730 --> 52:56.163
if you consider your whole life.

52:57.090 --> 52:58.000
I am.

52:59.210 --> 53:01.281
You opened my eyes Worht.
That's something.

53:03.571 --> 53:04.367
David.

53:06.491 --> 53:07.288
Helen.

53:10.532 --> 53:11.885
You're such a Helen.

53:58.219 --> 53:59.811
That's as far as you go.

54:04.260 --> 54:05.739
There's nothing down here.

54:07.580 --> 54:08.535
Hold tight.

54:09.700 --> 54:11.180
I try swinging over there.

54:20.382 --> 54:22.100
Brace yourselves,
I'm gonna try again.

54:27.983 --> 54:32.978
- Okay, one more time.
- Hurry, you're getting heavy.

54:43.905 --> 54:45.657
What the hell's going on?

54:46.146 --> 54:47.704
Get up here now!

55:18.990 --> 55:20.503
- Quentin!
- Have you got her?

55:21.110 --> 55:24.865
- What's going on?
- Quentin, is she okay?

55:50.035 --> 55:54.074
She... slipped.

55:55.515 --> 55:56.504
Holloway?

56:27.000 --> 56:28.558
Hey, shhh...
Come on, Kazan.

56:30.480 --> 56:32.358
Kazan, will you please
stop doing that?

56:33.281 --> 56:36.876
Leaven, you got be strong,
sweetheart.

56:37.001 --> 56:38.275
Don't even talk to me.

56:40.682 --> 56:42.195
We gotta get down to the bottom.

56:44.362 --> 56:46.513
It will be easier to get on
to the shell from there.

56:48.483 --> 56:50.872
It's a long fucking way
with only one boot.

56:51.203 --> 56:53.434
But we gotta do it
before we get too weak.

56:54.964 --> 56:56.795
You gotta keep
cracking the numbers, Leaven.

56:58.084 --> 56:59.597
I can't think anymore.

56:59.724 --> 57:02.603
Sure you can. It's your gift.

57:03.165 --> 57:06.123
It's not a gift. It's just a brain.

57:07.246 --> 57:10.158
Let her sleep for a while. We haven't
slept in fuck knows how long.

57:11.646 --> 57:12.761
All right.

57:14.327 --> 57:15.362
One hour.

57:16.127 --> 57:18.402
How the fuck are you gonna know
how long an hour is?

57:20.167 --> 57:22.602
An hour is as long as I say.

58:24.977 --> 58:26.205
What are you doing?

58:28.337 --> 58:29.690
We have to make it down
to the bottom.

58:30.057 --> 58:31.855
It'll be quiet there, and
you can concentrate.

58:33.458 --> 58:35.892
- You just want to leave them?
- They're traps, Leaven.

58:37.098 --> 58:38.133
We are the key.

58:38.538 --> 58:40.894
I'll get us down there.
You think us out.

58:41.419 --> 58:42.408
Believe in me!

58:42.819 --> 58:45.492
Try and see what I see,
how my mind works.

58:45.619 --> 58:48.339
The flash when I look into someone's
head like a fucking X-ray.

58:51.860 --> 58:53.055
I looked through the walls.

58:53.901 --> 58:57.780
I dreamed him at his desk,
designing everything.

59:00.302 --> 59:01.940
He can't let you solve the puzzle,
see, 'cause

59:02.022 --> 59:03.216
there is a purpose.

59:03.742 --> 59:05.141
We are the purpose. The cube...

59:05.982 --> 59:07.017
...is us.

59:08.663 --> 59:11.700
- Quentin.
- We fit. Like numbers.

59:13.263 --> 59:16.097
A man and a woman.
Two halves of the equation.

59:17.344 --> 59:20.814
I take you down, the perfect key.

59:21.425 --> 59:22.778
I slip you in the lock.

59:27.985 --> 59:31.137
Leaven, it's time to go down.

59:45.348 --> 59:46.337
Get away from her.

59:48.468 --> 59:51.063
Leaven, they're fuckin' spies.

59:51.349 --> 59:52.623
Him, the retard.

59:53.189 --> 59:55.703
Holloway, had outside
information about my family...

59:55.789 --> 59:58.588
but she slipped up, didn't she?
She crossed the line!

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:02.788
You dropped her.

01:00:06.511 --> 01:00:07.626
Just go, Quentin.

01:00:09.111 --> 01:00:11.182
Give us the boot, you pig!

01:00:29.554 --> 01:00:31.067
You don't want the boot.

01:00:51.157 --> 01:00:54.434
You want to came with us, Worth?
Down the hatch.

01:01:02.039 --> 01:01:03.313
What the fuck's with him?

01:01:49.566 --> 01:01:50.715
How did...

01:01:52.526 --> 01:01:57.237
It's, it's, it's the Wren.
It's the old Wrenster.

01:01:59.087 --> 01:02:00.281
How could...

01:02:01.167 --> 01:02:03.398
We've been going around in circles.

01:02:04.368 --> 01:02:05.357
That can't be.

01:02:09.648 --> 01:02:11.640
- Where are we?
- I don't know!

01:02:13.569 --> 01:02:15.764
Where are we?

01:02:21.010 --> 01:02:22.204
You figure it out!

01:02:22.410 --> 01:02:25.926
You haven't done anything.
All you do is freak out you,

01:02:26.491 --> 01:02:27.765
murderer!

01:03:08.297 --> 01:03:09.889
I guess you were right, Worth.

01:03:11.097 --> 01:03:12.769
There is no way out of here.

01:03:38.301 --> 01:03:39.734
Get away from me.

01:04:13.386 --> 01:04:14.978
Wasn't Rennes killed in that room?

01:04:25.668 --> 01:04:27.181
How come there's nothing out there?

01:04:29.788 --> 01:04:30.903
It's the edge.

01:04:31.108 --> 01:04:33.703
We weren't at the edge before.
Where's the room that killed Rennes?

01:04:34.749 --> 01:04:35.898
Fuck off!

01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:41.664
Oh, that was good.

01:04:42.350 --> 01:04:45.821
What difference does it make?
We're dead anyways.

01:04:45.991 --> 01:04:50.348
Hey, listen to what I'm saying.
There was a room there before.

01:04:52.591 --> 01:04:55.550
We haven't been moving in circles.
The rooms have.

01:04:55.912 --> 01:04:58.301
- Of course.
- The rooms?

01:04:58.632 --> 01:05:00.271
That explains
the thunder and the shaking.

01:05:00.393 --> 01:05:02.031
We've been shifting the whole time.

01:05:04.033 --> 01:05:06.388
It's the only logical explanation.

01:05:08.994 --> 01:05:10.632
I'm such an idiot!

01:05:11.434 --> 01:05:13.789
- What are you on to, Leaven?
- Give me a minute.

01:05:16.475 --> 01:05:18.909
The numbers are markers,
points on a map, right?

01:05:19.395 --> 01:05:20.225
Right.

01:05:21.396 --> 01:05:24.513
How do you map a point
that keeps moving?

01:05:27.596 --> 01:05:28.825
Permutations.

01:05:31.237 --> 01:05:32.192
Permu what?

01:05:33.277 --> 01:05:34.266
Permutations.

01:05:34.357 --> 01:05:36.918
A list of all the coordinates
that the room passes through.

01:05:36.998 --> 01:05:38.795
Like a map, that tells you
where the rooms starts,

01:05:38.878 --> 01:05:41.153
how many times it moves,
and where it moves to.

01:05:42.319 --> 01:05:43.911
The numbers tell you all that?

01:05:44.399 --> 01:05:45.957
I don't know,

01:05:46.039 --> 01:05:47.836
see, I've only been looking
at one point on the map,

01:05:47.919 --> 01:05:49.876
which is probably
the starting position.

01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:53.830
All I saw was what the cube looked
like before it started to move.

01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:55.354
Okay, so it's moving.

01:05:58.641 --> 01:05:59.835
How do we get out?

01:06:02.281 --> 01:06:03.510
27.

01:06:07.722 --> 01:06:09.394
I know where the exit is.

01:06:10.683 --> 01:06:11.559
Where?

01:06:12.363 --> 01:06:14.593
- Stay away from me.
- Back off, Quentin.

01:06:15.723 --> 01:06:16.951
I just wanna know.

01:06:18.164 --> 01:06:19.438
Don't you wanna know?

01:06:23.324 --> 01:06:25.441
You remember that room
we passed through before,

01:06:25.685 --> 01:06:27.880
the one with the coordinate
larger than 26?

01:06:28.325 --> 01:06:29.314
What about it?

01:06:30.365 --> 01:06:34.279
That coordinate placed the room
outside the cube.

01:06:36.846 --> 01:06:37.722
A bridge.

01:06:38.206 --> 01:06:41.483
Right.
But only in its original position.

01:06:43.047 --> 01:06:44.275
What are you talking about?

01:06:48.008 --> 01:06:51.080
Look.
The room starts off as a bridge,

01:06:51.168 --> 01:06:53.125
and then it moves its way
through the maze,

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:54.608
which is where we ran into it.

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:57.927
But at some point,
it must return to its original position.

01:06:58.009 --> 01:07:00.888
- So a bridge is only a bridge.
- For a short period of time.

01:07:01.330 --> 01:07:03.798
This thing is like
a giant combination lock.

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:06.199
When the rooms are in their
starting position, the lock is open.

01:07:06.290 --> 01:07:08.680
But when they move
out of alignment, the lock closes.

01:07:08.851 --> 01:07:10.682
With a structure this size,
it must take days

01:07:10.771 --> 01:07:12.568
for the rooms
to complete a full cycle.

01:07:13.091 --> 01:07:14.411
So, when does it open?

01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:24.562
Don't.

01:07:25.173 --> 01:07:27.562
To find the original coordinates,
the numbers are added together.

01:07:27.653 --> 01:07:30.293
To find the permutations, they're
subtracted from one another.

01:07:33.414 --> 01:07:34.051
That's it!

01:07:35.135 --> 01:07:38.525
This room moves to zero,
1 and -1 on the X-axis.

01:07:38.655 --> 01:07:40.611
2, 5 and -7 on Y.

01:07:41.215 --> 01:07:43.935
And 1, and -1 and zero on Z.

01:07:44.136 --> 01:07:45.535
And what does that mean?

01:07:46.216 --> 01:07:47.444
You suck at math?

01:07:47.936 --> 01:07:50.405
Okay, I need the room numbers
around us as reference points.

01:07:52.737 --> 01:07:56.526
666, 897, 466.

01:07:58.458 --> 01:08:03.009
- 567, 898. Okay?
- Yes.

01:08:03.098 --> 01:08:06.136
And 545.
Did you get that?

01:08:10.019 --> 01:08:14.093
656, 778, 462.

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:19.533
That's enough.
X is 17, Y is 25 and Z is 14.

01:08:22.661 --> 01:08:24.857
Which means
this room makes 2 more moves

01:08:24.942 --> 01:08:26.898
before returning
to its original position.

01:08:26.982 --> 01:08:28.779
- Do we have time?
- Maybe.

01:08:28.902 --> 01:08:29.698
Then let's go!

01:08:29.982 --> 01:08:31.335
Can you work
the traps into this system?

01:08:31.423 --> 01:08:33.334
Fuck the traps.
Let's get to the bridge.

01:08:33.423 --> 01:08:35.778
You threw out our last boot,
you fucking idiot.

01:08:35.863 --> 01:08:38.617
- Technically, I can identify the traps.
- Technically?

01:08:38.743 --> 01:08:40.176
At first, I thought
that they were identified

01:08:40.264 --> 01:08:41.935
by prime numbers,
but they are not.

01:08:42.024 --> 01:08:44.379
They are identified by numbers
that are the power of a prime.

01:08:44.464 --> 01:08:46.296
- Ok, so?
- Can you calculate that?

01:08:47.024 --> 01:08:48.014
The numbers are huge.

01:08:48.104 --> 01:08:50.300
But you can, right? She can.

01:08:50.425 --> 01:08:52.939
I'd have to calculate
the number of factors in each set.

01:08:53.106 --> 01:08:54.300
Maybe if I had a computer.

01:08:54.386 --> 01:08:56.058
- You don't need a computer.
- Yes I do.

01:08:56.145 --> 01:08:57.658
- Figure it out.
- I can't.

01:08:57.746 --> 01:09:00.341
I'm not dying in a fucking rat maze!

01:09:00.947 --> 01:09:04.223
Look. Nobody in the whole world
could do it mentally.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:07.663
Look at the numbers. 567898545.

01:09:07.747 --> 01:09:09.545
There's no way I can factor that!

01:09:09.627 --> 01:09:14.783
I can't even start on 567!
It's astronomical!

01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:17.625
2.

01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:23.587
Astronomical.

01:09:24.710 --> 01:09:25.859
What did you say?

01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:28.541
Astronomical.

01:09:29.031 --> 01:09:30.066
Before that.

01:09:31.871 --> 01:09:32.906
Factors.

01:09:34.031 --> 01:09:36.944
How many factors Kazan?
Of 567.

01:09:37.591 --> 01:09:38.468
2.

01:09:39.072 --> 01:09:40.743
What, are you fucking kidding?

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:44.027
Kazan. How many
factors does 30 have?

01:09:44.153 --> 01:09:44.948
3.

01:09:45.593 --> 01:09:48.426
- How about 7?
- 1. Gum drop.

01:09:49.033 --> 01:09:50.386
I don't have any gum drops.

01:09:51.073 --> 01:09:52.063
Gum drop.

01:09:52.474 --> 01:09:56.991
Kazan. I'll give you a whole box
of gum drops for each answer.

01:09:57.355 --> 01:09:59.346
Gum drops come in bags.

01:09:59.475 --> 01:10:01.466
Okay. You want them in bags,
they are coming in bags.

01:10:01.555 --> 01:10:03.865
I don't like the red ones.

01:10:06.516 --> 01:10:09.474
- 898.
- 2.

01:10:10.757 --> 01:10:13.715
- 545.
- 2.

01:10:13.877 --> 01:10:15.310
He's giving us the factors.

01:10:15.877 --> 01:10:18.028
Astronomical.

01:10:18.878 --> 01:10:22.029
You're telling me
telethon boy is a genius?

01:10:23.158 --> 01:10:25.354
By those numbers,
the room should be safe.

01:10:25.799 --> 01:10:27.517
Only one way to find out.

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:30.355
Don't!

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:35.596
Safe.

01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.157
Kazan, my man.

01:10:43.641 --> 01:10:45.199
What's the number, buddy boy?

01:10:45.882 --> 01:10:49.079
Hey, right here, look here!

01:10:50.362 --> 01:10:51.681
Make him do it!

01:10:54.723 --> 01:10:57.112
Kazan, we're gonna do
some numbers now, okay?

01:10:57.203 --> 01:10:58.761
We like to do numbers, right?

01:10:59.243 --> 01:11:01.075
- Prime numbers.
- That's right.

01:11:01.404 --> 01:11:04.316
- Can you tell me the factor of 656?
- 2.

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:07.234
- 779?
- 2.

01:11:07.445 --> 01:11:09.356
- 462?
- 3.

01:11:09.645 --> 01:11:10.873
- Clear.
- Move!

01:11:11.725 --> 01:11:14.684
Come on. Come on,
let's go. You too, Worth!

01:11:18.286 --> 01:11:21.757
Move your scawny ass, Worth.
I'm not through with you yet.

01:11:22.167 --> 01:11:23.361
Leaven, open that door.

01:11:23.527 --> 01:11:25.279
Get Einstein
working on the numbers.

01:11:28.608 --> 01:11:29.404
Oh, jeez.

01:11:29.488 --> 01:11:30.887
- Go!
- Worth!

01:11:31.048 --> 01:11:33.198
- Hurry!
- Leaven!

01:11:36.929 --> 01:11:37.839
563!

01:11:39.009 --> 01:11:41.807
- Please, Kazan, 563?
- You fuckers, you're dead!

01:11:42.330 --> 01:11:43.922
- 2.
- Clear!

01:11:49.651 --> 01:11:51.960
- 1.
- Trapped!

01:11:55.331 --> 01:11:57.004
- Check the floor.
- Is he dead?

01:11:58.212 --> 01:11:59.167
Not quite.

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:02.041
Not even close. Worth,
I'm getting out of here and

01:12:02.132 --> 01:12:04.363
I'll feed you to
a fucking trap on the way.

01:12:13.174 --> 01:12:14.209
Where is he?

01:12:14.734 --> 01:12:19.286
Come here. I said
come here right nooowwww!!

01:12:23.775 --> 01:12:25.971
Gotchya. That way.

01:12:28.456 --> 01:12:29.775
- 2.
- Clear!

01:12:30.736 --> 01:12:31.726
- 4.
- Clear!

01:13:03.221 --> 01:13:05.655
Guess that proves our theory.
Numbers.

01:13:05.781 --> 01:13:08.979
- 4, 2, 3.
- Clear.

01:13:18.063 --> 01:13:20.293
Kazan!

01:13:39.586 --> 01:13:40.541
Listen.

01:13:42.707 --> 01:13:45.096
- He hasn't moved far.
- I'll go find him.

01:13:50.708 --> 01:13:51.697
What do you think?

01:13:53.068 --> 01:13:54.626
You don't have a lot of lives left.

01:14:11.911 --> 01:14:15.221
- Kazan!
- I didn't move.

01:14:15.311 --> 01:14:17.223
Yeah, good. But you're gonna have
to climb up here, okay?

01:14:17.312 --> 01:14:18.791
I don't like that.

01:14:33.194 --> 01:14:37.472
14, 26, 14.

01:14:37.874 --> 01:14:39.991
Worth, get back here right now!

01:14:40.075 --> 01:14:41.508
Five bags of gum drops.

01:14:41.595 --> 01:14:44.234
27 bags total.

01:14:44.315 --> 01:14:45.510
27 bags. Deal.

01:14:46.556 --> 01:14:49.628
This room's next move
takes it to the bridge!

01:14:49.836 --> 01:14:50.871
We're coming!

01:14:53.757 --> 01:14:54.553
Over here!

01:14:55.437 --> 01:14:58.986
Move it! We don't have
much time. Come on.

01:15:29.922 --> 01:15:31.640
Worth? Worth?

01:15:34.562 --> 01:15:35.962
This better be it.

01:15:37.083 --> 01:15:38.072
It should be.

01:15:46.044 --> 01:15:46.794
Where?

01:15:58.166 --> 01:15:59.076
Oh, well!

01:16:02.366 --> 01:16:04.198
Give me a minute. Be patient.

01:16:05.447 --> 01:16:07.597
- So, guess what?
- No.

01:16:09.047 --> 01:16:11.004
This is the room we started in.

01:16:12.008 --> 01:16:15.887
I was right. We should
never have moved in the first place.

01:16:38.772 --> 01:16:39.966
The bridge.

01:16:41.252 --> 01:16:42.002
Red.

01:16:42.692 --> 01:16:43.681
Kazan?

01:16:47.333 --> 01:16:50.848
- 4, 2, 4.
- Clear!

01:17:50.862 --> 01:17:51.658
Worth!

01:17:55.302 --> 01:17:56.213
Go ahead.

01:17:56.823 --> 01:17:57.858
What are you doing?

01:17:58.063 --> 01:17:59.542
You can't quit now.

01:18:03.704 --> 01:18:05.615
It's not your fault!

01:18:06.104 --> 01:18:10.303
I have nothing to live for out there.

01:18:13.385 --> 01:18:14.613
What is out there?

01:18:26.987 --> 01:18:29.501
Boundless human stupidity.

01:18:35.948 --> 01:18:37.222
I can live with that.

01:18:55.271 --> 01:18:56.784
Noooooo!!!

01:19:01.432 --> 01:19:03.150
Kazan! Get out through the door!

01:19:30.916 --> 01:19:32.144
Red, Kazan.
