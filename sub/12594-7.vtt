00:02.470 --> 00:05.166
***

00:09.810 --> 00:11.766
- Ha ha ha! Five in a row.
Drink up.

00:11.810 --> 00:15.632
- Why does the
loser have to drink?
- Guess who just landed

00:15.680 --> 00:18.706
a new client?
We are made in the Shade,

00:18.750 --> 00:20.809
and yes, I just said that.

00:20.850 --> 00:25.139
Wow. Is this as strangely
provocative as it looks?

00:25.190 --> 00:27.454
Maybe don't answer.
- We're celebrating!

00:27.490 --> 00:29.458
Maz is getting promoted
to Detective Sergeant.

00:29.490 --> 00:32.596
It's not official yet.

00:32.630 --> 00:35.121
- Come on, even I heard
the rumour. You're a lock.

00:35.160 --> 00:38.163
- Congrats, but can we bring
it back to me for a second?
My Craigslist ad paid off.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.135
Solid plan.

00:41.170 --> 00:43.809
- This one is the real deal.
The guy's name is Jay Lee.

00:43.840 --> 00:45.808
He owns an awesome
karaoke bar and he makes

00:45.840 --> 00:49.071
the best absinthe flip
you've ever tasted.

00:49.110 --> 00:51.442
- Intriguing. Put the file on
my desk. I'll look at it later.

00:51.480 --> 00:54.313
- Yeah, here's the thing:
I kinda said yes.

00:54.350 --> 00:57.080
- Oh, dude, you should have
vetted it through Angie.

00:57.120 --> 00:59.418
There's a lot of nutbars
on the interweb.

01:02.860 --> 01:06.227
- * Born to be wild

01:09.470 --> 01:11.620
* Born to be wild

01:11.670 --> 01:13.638
- Hey, we're looking
for Jay Lee?

01:13.670 --> 01:16.366
- Out back.
- Thanks.

01:16.410 --> 01:18.628
- Hell, no. Shades don't sing.

01:18.670 --> 01:20.706
At least not in public.

01:20.740 --> 01:22.844
- Huh. I thought your hockey
career made you impervious

01:22.880 --> 01:25.178
to public humiliation.
- My hockey paycheques

01:25.210 --> 01:27.314
made me impervious
to public humiliation.

01:27.350 --> 01:30.217
There's our client.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.718
Look, I know you're all about
researching our clients

01:32.760 --> 01:34.853
before you commit,
but Jay is genuinely scared.

01:34.890 --> 01:38.849
- He thinks he's being followed.

01:38.890 --> 01:40.790
He wants us to watch him
day and night. You know,

01:40.830 --> 01:43.719
snap some pictures, keep an eye
out for suspicious characters.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.668
- I'm gonna need more specifics.

01:48.700 --> 01:51.737
- A friend of his suddenly went
missing and it's got him
kind of freaked out.

01:51.770 --> 01:53.874
- Guy's name is Teddy Sparkle.

01:53.910 --> 01:56.777
- Did Teddy Sparkle disappear
with or without his unicorn?

01:56.810 --> 01:59.677
- You mock because you didn't
bring this case in yourself.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.143
- Well, I'd prefer
if you'd asked me first.

02:02.190 --> 02:05.910
I mean, I have more experience
vetting the marginal customers.

02:05.950 --> 02:08.282
- This isn't that kind of case.
Jay's a stand-up guy.

02:14.660 --> 02:16.525
- If by stand-up guy
you mean drug dealer...

02:18.600 --> 02:20.795
Give your buddy his money back.
I'm calling this one.

02:22.970 --> 02:25.268
- Wait! Do you remember
why you first hired me?

02:25.310 --> 02:27.437
- Good instincts.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.505
My gut tells me there's
something here, Angie.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.939
Do you trust me or not?

02:31.980 --> 02:35.814
- This better be one
amazing absinthe flip.

02:38.820 --> 02:42.654
***

02:42.690 --> 02:45.523
- I know how it looked,
but it's not what you think.

02:45.560 --> 02:48.290
I'm not a dealer.

02:48.330 --> 02:50.469
- I'm not really
at liberty to say.

02:50.500 --> 02:53.264
All I can tell you is nice
catch. You guys are clearly

02:53.300 --> 02:55.860
the right people for the job,
and please keep it up.

02:55.900 --> 02:58.937
- Is this part of some
elaborate hipster art project?

02:58.970 --> 03:01.939
Are we going to be on Vimeo?
- I'm pretty sure

03:01.980 --> 03:04.403
I'm in danger.

03:04.450 --> 03:06.418
It's hard to explain.
- Well, give it a shot.

03:06.450 --> 03:08.418
Tell us about your
friend who disappeared,

03:08.450 --> 03:11.317
Teddy Not-His-Real-Name Sparkle.
- Teddy and I met here.

03:11.350 --> 03:14.285
He was a regular
at 305 Jazz Night.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.982
A while back, he got busted
with an ounce of weed

03:17.030 --> 03:20.488
and he... he changed.

03:20.530 --> 03:22.964
Got paranoid, wouldn't
talk about it and then...

03:23.000 --> 03:25.468
I haven't seen him
for two weeks.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.559
- And you think the same thing's
gonna happen to you?

03:27.600 --> 03:30.501
- We hang in the same circles.
- Drug-dealing circles.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.906
- I swear I don't sell drugs.

03:32.940 --> 03:35.875
But I feel this malevolent
presence around me.

03:35.910 --> 03:38.777
If you guys tail me,
keep an eye out, maybe we can,

03:38.810 --> 03:42.348
you can find out who.
But don't come too c-close.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.244
You cannot,
under any circumstances,

03:44.290 --> 03:46.258
get caught tailing me.

03:46.290 --> 03:48.315
And it's only for two days.
If you still think I'm crooked

03:48.360 --> 03:50.328
after that, call the c-c-cops.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.999
No, no, no,
just scratch that. Uh...

03:53.030 --> 03:55.999
Please. I need your help.

03:56.030 --> 03:59.796
- Look, I have no illusions
about why people come to P.I.s

03:59.840 --> 04:02.400
and I'm not big on judging.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.466
But I don't work for dealers.

04:05.510 --> 04:09.276
Two days. And we'll walk sooner
if you're shining us on.

04:13.520 --> 04:16.045
- Look, just between me
and you, what's going on?

04:16.080 --> 04:18.742
You're making me look bad.
- Sorry, Shade.

04:18.790 --> 04:21.816
I never want to make a man look
less than amazmg In front
of his woman.

04:21.860 --> 04:24.055
- Angie's my boss!

04:24.090 --> 04:27.753
- I am not getting boss vibes.

04:35.540 --> 04:39.032
- ** I see you and you see me

04:39.070 --> 04:43.404
* Watch you blowin' the lines
when you're making a scene *

04:43.450 --> 04:46.817
* Oh boy, you've got to know

04:46.850 --> 04:48.943
* What my head overlooks

04:48.980 --> 04:52.655
* The senses will show
to my heart *

04:52.690 --> 04:55.409
* When it's watching for lies

04:55.460 --> 04:57.781
* 'Cause you can't escape my

04:57.830 --> 04:59.422
* Private Eyes

04:59.460 --> 05:01.928
* They're watching you

05:01.960 --> 05:04.565
* Private Eyes

05:04.600 --> 05:06.591
* They're watching you,
watching you, watching you *

05:06.640 --> 05:10.667
* Watching you *

05:10.710 --> 05:12.928
***

05:12.980 --> 05:15.107
- Scrambled eggs, pea meal
bacon. Jules's favourite,

05:15.140 --> 05:17.938
always has been.
- If she's late getting up,

05:17.980 --> 05:21.017
she doesn't get her vote.
Over-easy, sausage.

05:21.050 --> 05:23.541
- This is your granddaughter
we're talking about here.

05:23.590 --> 05:25.581
- Game on.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.358
- Jules, your grandfather's
trying to cheat us

05:33.400 --> 05:36.722
out of scrambled eggs, again.
- OK, anything but eggs.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.863
Ariel snuck tamagoyaki
into the play last night

05:38.900 --> 05:40.868
and I am done with eggs
for a week.

05:40.900 --> 05:44.563
- Granola it is.

05:44.610 --> 05:46.498
- Only the coolest
girl in drama.

05:46.540 --> 05:48.701
- Look at you, hitting it off
with the cool kids.

05:48.740 --> 05:51.777
- Yeah, and they're seniors.
Can't believe they invited me.

05:51.810 --> 05:54.779
But I'm probably never going
to hear from them again.

05:54.820 --> 05:57.789
- So call them. D_oesn't hurt
to prove you're Interested.

05:57.820 --> 05:59.879
- No, no.

05:59.920 --> 06:02.627
In this scenario, if you want
to be the cool kid, you gotta

06:02.660 --> 06:04.457
hang back. Let them reach out.
- Me and Ariel are hitting

06:04.490 --> 06:06.458
the mall after school.
- It's only a matter of time

06:06.500 --> 06:08.991
before they call you.
- Sorry, I wasn't listening.

06:09.030 --> 06:12.466
Gotta get back to her.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.799
- My coolest father moment ever,
and she didn't even notice.

06:15.840 --> 06:18.832
- Yep. Get used to it.

06:21.910 --> 06:24.071
- Sparkle. Uh, Teddy,
or Theodore?

06:24.110 --> 06:26.670
See if he's shown up
as a missing person.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.938
OK. Thanks, Maz.

06:28.980 --> 06:32.484
- Maz again. You guys
really are close.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.886
- Well, I'm happy to call him
a friend. I'll be very happy

06:34.920 --> 06:36.888
to call him Detective Sergeant.
- Good to have friends

06:36.930 --> 06:38.886
in high places.
- Clients in high places,

06:38.930 --> 06:41.649
however...
- He's doing ﬁne.

06:41.700 --> 06:44.919
His bar is thriving, even
if he is an MBA drop-out

06:44.970 --> 06:48.758
with a bachelor's degree in...
philosophy and botany?

06:48.800 --> 06:50.961
- Perfect for a bartender.
I spoke to a loose-lipped

06:51.010 --> 06:53.706
teller at his bank. He hasn't
missed a smgle loan payment.

06:53.740 --> 06:55.776
- Told you. He's a good kid.

06:55.810 --> 06:58.677
- I wonder if the mob's
trying to shake him down.

06:58.710 --> 07:02.544
His bar is in their wheelhouse.
- Are you warmIng up to our
botany

07:02.590 --> 07:05.047
- Like you said: paid in cash.

07:05.090 --> 07:07.809
Plus, he does have
an interesting tell.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.226
- Do tell.
- Well, he's got a...

07:10.260 --> 07:12.558
he's got a stutter that comes
out every one in a while.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.160
I'm not sure what triggers it,
but it's there.

07:17.270 --> 07:20.535
***

07:20.570 --> 07:23.130
He's really ticking off
all the hipster boxes.

07:23.170 --> 07:25.604
Is he going to pick up
some beard oil next?

07:25.640 --> 07:29.076
- He doesn't have a beard. And
why are you so hard on hipsters?

07:29.110 --> 07:31.601
- They claim to defile trends,
but they're all about image.

07:31.650 --> 07:33.948
Take his bike,
that ridiculous cart.

07:33.980 --> 07:35.948
It screams,
"Look how unique I am!"

07:35.980 --> 07:37.743
Or that he lost his oxen.

07:37.790 --> 07:40.953
- I think hipsters get a bad
rap. Once you get past

07:40.990 --> 07:43.959
the tattoos and the skinny
jeans, you have to admit,
they make a mean coffee.

07:43.990 --> 07:45.958
- Which they aren't afraid
to let you know about.

07:45.990 --> 07:48.959
- Think of all the good things
that've come out of the
hipster movement...

07:49.000 --> 07:51.696
Artisanal cheese: good.
Craft beers: good.

07:51.730 --> 07:55.860
- Amish hats, oversized glasses,
man buns: less good.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.562
- Yeah. Point well taken. Oh!

07:58.610 --> 08:02.876
Hipster on the move.

08:05.310 --> 08:08.108
- Hey, slow down, partner.
- Hey, babe. Nice to hear

08:08.150 --> 08:10.983
your voice, but I'd prefer to
k-keep this a long-distance
relationship.

08:11.020 --> 08:13.989
- Hey, dude, I like you too, but
let's ease up on the intimacy.

08:14.020 --> 08:17.057
- Better if you don't call me,
babe, 'K? I need my space.

08:19.030 --> 08:22.056
- I thought the artisanal
marijuana skipped the
paranoia factor.

08:22.100 --> 08:23.988
- There was that stutter
you were talking about.

08:24.030 --> 08:25.998
- OK, I'm only half-joking
about the paranoia thing.

08:26.030 --> 08:27.998
We have to consider that
Jay might be out of his tree.

08:28.040 --> 08:29.905
- We also have to consider
he has a reason to be speaking

08:29.940 --> 08:32.738
in code. Maybe his
pursuers are here.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.805
- The only people
stalking him are us.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.547
- Houston, we have a box.

08:41.120 --> 08:43.088
- I can't... I can't get him.
His back's to us.

08:43.120 --> 08:45.748
- Call me in 20 seconds.

08:45.790 --> 08:48.156
- Shade!
: Do we have enough time?

08:48.190 --> 08:50.658
This is it.

08:50.690 --> 08:53.955
Oh, hey, honey.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.922
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

08:55.960 --> 09:00.033
Two bottles? Yeah. Yeah, sure,
I'll stop by the liquor store.

09:00.070 --> 09:03.039
Women, right?

09:09.950 --> 09:12.976
It was nothing. He was buying
a vintage board game.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.978
- I'm just saying it was
reckless. Seems to be an ongoing

09:16.020 --> 09:17.988
theme with you these days.
- Did I or did I not

09:18.020 --> 09:21.114
get the photo?
- So far we've confirmed

09:21.160 --> 09:24.584
your client enjoys obscure
vinyl, Truth Apocalypse

09:24.630 --> 09:27.349
and now he's buying rutabagas.
- Just give it some time.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.267
- If it's any consolation,

09:30.300 --> 09:32.325
I think he's telling
the truth about last night.

09:32.370 --> 09:34.361
Everything about
his business seems legit.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.937
Twee as hell, but legit.

09:36.970 --> 09:39.973
- Well, maybe he makes more
money than he's letting
on and he's hiding it.

09:40.010 --> 09:43.741
- Well, if the mob shows up,
you'll have to ask them.

09:43.780 --> 09:45.805
- I have a summons to pop off

09:45.850 --> 09:48.216
and a mound of paperwork. You
can handle gamer boy from here.

09:48.250 --> 09:51.014
- Most dangerous thing he's done

09:51.050 --> 09:53.086
is fondle some organic fruit.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.111
I think you can
take it from here.

10:00.160 --> 10:02.151
- OK...

10:15.910 --> 10:18.708
Jay, what's up?

10:18.750 --> 10:22.049
I know I asked you to distance
yourself, but I feel like

10:22.080 --> 10:24.048
- I'm right here!

10:24.090 --> 10:27.059
- Uh, I feel like I want
you to be c-c-close.

10:27.090 --> 10:29.854
- I'm coming to you.

10:29.890 --> 10:32.927
I was wrong. You
and me, we're not working out.]

10:32.960 --> 10:35.019
Don't c-c-call me again.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.098
I'm sorry about that.
: Come on!

10:45.170 --> 10:48.071
- Alright, peace out.
I'll see you later, alright?

10:56.120 --> 10:58.145
***

10:58.190 --> 11:00.010
- Whoa! Sorry.

11:00.060 --> 11:03.848
Just got, uh...

11:08.200 --> 11:10.691
- Wait, don't... shake...

11:12.940 --> 11:15.431
I
You lied to me, man.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.075
Stay here.

11:45.100 --> 11:47.364
I screwed up.
- Hold on! Wait.

11:47.400 --> 11:49.800
I've got popcorn here somewhere.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.808
- Jay's a dealer. I should have
vetted this through you.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.206
I'm sorry.
- With a kilo of coke.

11:54.240 --> 11:56.947
And what's a board-
game—playing hipster

11:56.980 --> 11:59.005
doing with a semi
- I don't know!

11:59.050 --> 12:02.816
It's for crowd control at
a Settlers of Cattan marathon?

12:02.850 --> 12:06.081
Jay's a liar. You called it.
- I checked into Jay's
missing buddy.

12:06.120 --> 12:08.111
Teddy Sparkle's entire
social media footprint

12:08.160 --> 12:11.823
went dark two weeks ago.
- His so-called buddy's
probably not even real.

12:11.860 --> 12:14.351
- Then how do you explain
Jay's behaviour?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.254
- I don't know! He's a dealer!
The mob's probably after him

12:16.300 --> 12:19.292
for cutting in on their turf.
- Mobsters don't play
board games.

12:19.330 --> 12:23.164
Everett Investigations.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.269
- Angie, it's Jules. If you're
with my dad right now,

12:25.310 --> 12:27.278
don't say anything. Please.

12:30.480 --> 12:33.040
- I need your help.
I'm in trouble.

12:33.080 --> 12:36.846
- It's a possible
adultery case. Uh...

12:36.890 --> 12:40.155
Care to talk about it?
- I'm at the police station.

12:40.190 --> 12:42.408
57 Division.
- OK.

12:42.460 --> 12:45.258
I will come to you, then.

12:45.290 --> 12:47.451
- Oh, God.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.128
I hope not, but I have to go.

12:50.170 --> 12:53.537
You were right when you said
I hired you for your instincts.

12:53.570 --> 12:56.289
Don't give up on them now.

13:06.380 --> 13:09.144
Thanks, I'll take it from here.

13:09.180 --> 13:11.842
Hey, Jules.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.224
So?

13:19.460 --> 13:21.894
I was at the mall
with my friends

13:21.930 --> 13:24.160
and they're older than me
and I don't even know

13:24.200 --> 13:26.168
why they want me around.

13:26.200 --> 13:29.829
So I told them,
"Hey! Hey, watch this.

13:29.870 --> 13:33.203
No one ever suspects
the blind girl."

13:33.240 --> 13:35.504
And I stole something.

13:38.350 --> 13:41.239
- The manager suspected
the blind girl.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.316
: You get
anything good?

13:43.350 --> 13:46.547
- A t-shirt. Didn't even
get the right Size.

13:48.490 --> 13:51.152
- Hey. Did I ever tell you
about the time I got busted?

13:56.160 --> 13:58.060
You have no idea how much
time I had to waste

13:58.100 --> 14:00.489
proving that I wasn't a narc,
which means that I shoplifted

14:00.540 --> 14:03.862
my fanny off.
Mascara, chocolate, a bra...

14:06.510 --> 14:08.535
- Look, I know.

14:08.580 --> 14:10.571
I know I have to tell my dad.

14:13.520 --> 14:16.216
But I just want to figure out
how to do it, you know?

14:16.250 --> 14:19.117
- Oh, crap! Your dad's here.

14:22.260 --> 14:25.149
- The chamomile--
- Congrats!

14:25.190 --> 14:28.250
Hi! Hey, don't jinx it, OK?
It hasn't happened yet.

14:33.070 --> 14:35.129
- Hey, do you know when
Mazhari's getting back?

14:39.210 --> 14:43.101
- If this is about girl guide
cookies, I'll take a box.

14:43.150 --> 14:46.005
- Hey, Mazhari. Do you
know who this guy is?

14:46.050 --> 14:48.109
- Holy crap. Edgar Brava.
What are you messing

14:48.150 --> 14:50.118
with a guy like that for?

14:50.150 --> 14:53.381
- He's a new breed of bad guy.
He's a fake community booster

14:53.420 --> 14:56.253
who deals hard drugs to the
west end. It's a shame he's such

14:56.290 --> 14:58.258
a dick, though, 'cause I saw him
at Mariposa's one night.

14:58.290 --> 15:00.155
Man is a world-class
salsa dancer.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.395
- Tell me more
about your man crush.

15:02.430 --> 15:04.523
- Hey, I am comfortable
enough in my masculinity

15:04.570 --> 15:07.130
to admire another
man's Paso La Jenny.

15:07.170 --> 15:09.297
Edgar works for one of the bigs.

15:12.170 --> 15:15.071
Man by the name of Simon Tyrell.
Drug squad's been after him
for years.

15:15.110 --> 15:17.999
Now, Tyrell runs his business
like a legitimate operation --

15:18.050 --> 15:21.178
health benefits, two weeks paid
vacation -- but you screw up,

15:21.220 --> 15:25.281
your retirement plan starts
immediately and six feet under.

15:25.320 --> 15:27.288
- So what, you're Little Shade's
emergency contact?

15:27.320 --> 15:30.221
- Hardly. I don't know how
she got my phone number.

15:30.260 --> 15:32.148
- And now here you are, busting
her out of shoplifting jail.

15:32.190 --> 15:34.158
- That's what partners do.
- Aw, look at you

15:34.200 --> 15:36.156
and your soft spot.
- I don't have any soft spots.

15:36.200 --> 15:41.092
- Actually, if my memory
serves me correctly...

15:41.140 --> 15:43.199
- She's... she's right there.

15:47.210 --> 15:51.044
- Hey, kid.
Careful you don't go--

15:51.080 --> 15:53.173
At this point,

15:53.220 --> 15:55.347
I might as well go for
the full-on Helen Keller.

15:55.380 --> 15:57.245
- OK. I think it's about time

15:57.290 --> 16:00.009
the two of you stopped
hiding out in my office.

16:02.220 --> 16:04.529
- Shade's still here!

16:07.260 --> 16:10.195
- Sometimes I think he just
slams it for the attention.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.097
- It's a case of ours.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.335
I thought it was a pass,
but our client has a friend

16:15.370 --> 16:17.338
who's gone missing and
now he's afraid he's next.

16:19.370 --> 16:22.203
I asked Maz to
check on it for me.

16:22.240 --> 16:26.540
- Teddy Sparkle is a kid
named Teddy Borges.

16:26.580 --> 16:29.117
And Teddy Borges is dead.

16:31.290 --> 16:33.281
- Mm-hmm.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.254
- So, Edgar Bravas.
Is he as dangerous as his boss?

16:35.290 --> 16:37.429
- Mm. Don't let the
baby-face fool you.

16:37.460 --> 16:39.758
He did five years on his last
stretch. The guy is scum.

16:39.790 --> 16:42.520
Excuse me.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.222
Mazhari?

16:45.270 --> 16:47.397
Angie, hey!

16:47.440 --> 16:49.499
Yeah, I had a really good time,
too. You owe me a rematch,

16:49.540 --> 16:52.361
young lady.
- I totally won fair and square.

16:52.410 --> 16:55.379
I'm on the phone
with somebody over here.
- Give me the phone.

16:55.410 --> 16:58.243
- Yeah, your partner's in the
office. He's got into some
real serious sh--

16:58.280 --> 17:00.248
Yeah, I might
have found something

17:00.280 --> 17:02.544
that's real trouble. Yeah, OK.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.810
Yeah, I'll meet you
back at the agency.

17:04.850 --> 17:07.216
Still think I needed
to vet this through Angie?

17:09.320 --> 17:11.356
***

17:15.560 --> 17:18.290
You were right.
About me being right.

17:18.330 --> 17:20.264
Meet Edgar Brava,

17:20.300 --> 17:22.336
the man who dropped
the drugs in Jay's buggy.

17:22.370 --> 17:24.463
Spent six years in prison
on a half-dozen charges,

17:24.510 --> 17:27.206
all drugs and guns related.
Jay's a pothead.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.800
Nothing about him adds up
to being besties with this guy.

17:29.840 --> 17:34.072
- This is Teddy Borges,
Jay's friend.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.076
He died two weeks ago.
Two shots to the head.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.816
The case landed on Nolan's desk.
What I learned about Teddy

17:38.850 --> 17:41.853
doesn't add up to Edgar Brava
either. He worked three jobs,

17:41.890 --> 17:44.154
did a lot of yoga,
smoked a lot of weed.

17:44.190 --> 17:45.748
- Do the police have any
suspects in his murder?

17:45.790 --> 17:48.588
- Drug-related is all
Nolan would say.

17:48.630 --> 17:50.564
- So, two hipsters.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.433
One dead, one convinced
he's about to be.

17:53.470 --> 17:56.189
- Both caught up in dealing,
but neither fitting the profile

17:56.240 --> 17:58.231
of a criminal.
- When I was tailing Jay,

17:58.270 --> 18:00.238
he started up with the
sweetheart talk again,

18:00.280 --> 18:02.236
until Edgar Brava
pulled up next to him.

18:02.280 --> 18:05.443
- So they talked and then Brava
put the drugs in his cart.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.710
- That's right.
He was also stuttering.

18:07.750 --> 18:10.389
- Which he does when
he's scared, especially...

18:10.420 --> 18:12.718
when we mention police. Shade!

18:12.750 --> 18:14.718
Maybe Jay's a CI.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.751
- Confidential informant.

18:16.790 --> 18:18.758
Let's say the cops
bust Jay for possession.

18:18.790 --> 18:20.849
A possession charge would
threaten Jay's business,

18:20.900 --> 18:22.856
so the cop convinces
him to wear a wire

18:22.900 --> 18:25.596
and take down some bad guys.
- So he snitches for the cops

18:25.630 --> 18:28.497
to reduce the charges. If he's
a C.I., why not just tell us?

18:28.540 --> 18:31.338
- Because all C.I.s sign
confidentiality contracts.

18:31.370 --> 18:33.907
If he breaks it, he goes to jail
on the original drug charges

18:33.940 --> 18:35.908
and on new ones for
breaking the contract.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.249
- So he's trying to show us
what he is without telling us.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.248
And all that girlfriend
talk on the phone--

18:40.280 --> 18:42.510
- Is because he's wearing a wire
when he makes the buys!

18:42.550 --> 18:44.609
- And I almost blew his cover.

18:44.650 --> 18:47.756
- This kid's afraid for
his life... with good reason.

18:51.190 --> 18:53.192
(song: Danny Boy
by Frederic Weatherly)

18:55.660 --> 18:57.924
- Private event!
- Hey, buddy.

18:57.970 --> 19:01.235
I decided not to take
being dumped personally.

19:01.270 --> 19:03.261
- Uh, like I said, mister...

19:03.310 --> 19:05.266
...private event.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.529
- Well, hey, man.

19:08.580 --> 19:11.299
Sure. Uh, peace out.

19:22.560 --> 19:25.427
: Go! Go, go, go!
: Which way?

19:25.460 --> 19:27.257
- Get out of my way!

19:31.970 --> 19:34.939
- Ow!

19:38.010 --> 19:40.729
Hey, hey. Uh, sorry.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.736
- Hey, don't apologize
for loving to sing, Jay.

19:42.780 --> 19:44.748
- Just don't sing
to the wrong people.

19:44.780 --> 19:48.238
- Of course, Mr. Tyrell. Please.

19:55.460 --> 20:00.227
So, uh, Edgar says we c-can
move our relationship forward.

20:00.260 --> 20:02.728
- Edgar tells me you want
liquid cocaine.

20:02.760 --> 20:05.320
Pretty ambitious, Mr. Lee.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.361
Cutting edge.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.561
- Yeah, well, you can take
the kid out of MBA school

20:09.600 --> 20:12.728
but you can't take an interest
in profit differentials
out of the kid.

20:12.770 --> 20:17.707
- Yeah, I'm an MBA as well.
Let me guess, Keynesian?

20:17.750 --> 20:20.378
- More of a Hayek man myself.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.877
- I like you.

20:22.920 --> 20:24.911
We'll do this.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.612
But not here.

20:29.660 --> 20:32.379
- But I thought you wanted--
- Mr. Tyrell said no.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.459
Mr. Tyrell?

20:41.070 --> 20:43.402
- His handler must be close.
- You check out front.

20:43.440 --> 20:45.431
I'll take the back.

20:55.320 --> 20:57.743
- Hey.
- 'K, I got him.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.644
His handler's here.
I'm going in for a closer look.

20:59.690 --> 21:02.352
- No! No. If they spot you,
it's game over for Jay.

21:02.390 --> 21:04.529
- He may take it out on him
anyway. The deal didn't happen.

21:06.330 --> 21:09.629
OK, he's getting out.

21:09.660 --> 21:11.924
- Stay put.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.438
- He's driving away.

21:14.470 --> 21:16.961
We lost him.

21:19.070 --> 21:22.801
- Woo!

21:22.840 --> 21:24.671
Sorry.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.686
- Wow. My boss is amazing.

21:31.720 --> 21:36.316
- We believe you signed a
confidential informant contract.

21:36.360 --> 21:38.328
- You've got a stutter
that comes out sometimes,

21:38.360 --> 21:40.590
we think whenever you're wearing
a wire, and you talk to us

21:40.630 --> 21:43.394
in code when we're following
you, which is pretty smart.

21:43.430 --> 21:46.661
- And you're afraid to talk
about it because you think
you'll go to jail.

21:46.700 --> 21:48.861
- Can't believe
you don't have Angostura.

21:48.900 --> 21:51.107
Everybody has Angostura.
- We're pretty sure

21:51.140 --> 21:53.108
you're not wired now,
or else you wouldn't be here.

21:53.140 --> 21:56.109
Are we close?
- Any cop that would put you
in that situation is working

21:56.140 --> 21:59.405
way outside the law
and needs to be stopped.

21:59.450 --> 22:02.840
I saw his face. All we need
from you is a name. Who is he?

22:06.120 --> 22:10.079
- I am so sorry for getting
you guys into this.

22:10.120 --> 22:12.429
I gotta go.

22:12.460 --> 22:14.758
- Teddy's dead.

22:14.800 --> 22:18.827
- He was murdered. Shot twice
In the head, execution style.

22:18.870 --> 22:22.431
The police think it was
a drug deal gone sideways.

22:22.470 --> 22:24.028
- We think he was
a CI. just like you.

22:24.070 --> 22:26.630
He died alone, feeling
like he was trapped

22:26.670 --> 22:28.604
in an impossible situation.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.642
- You're not alone here, Jay.

22:34.750 --> 22:37.014
- I keep thinking,
this is the last one.

22:37.050 --> 22:39.848
I'll make one more deal,

22:39.890 --> 22:42.358
then it'll be the last one.

22:44.190 --> 22:46.522
But it never stops.

22:46.560 --> 22:49.654
- We can stop it.

22:49.700 --> 22:52.692
- We just need his name.

22:57.040 --> 22:59.031
_ [There's no Nick Bradley
on the police force.]

22:59.070 --> 23:02.938
- That's not possible.
- Maybe Jay's handler
is using a cover name.

23:02.980 --> 23:05.039
- That doesn't sound legit.
- If they want to stay off-book

23:05.080 --> 23:07.412
it does. We need to see Maz.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.475
- Alright, first thing
in the am. Later.

23:13.790 --> 23:17.089
What's going on?

23:17.120 --> 23:19.680
- I did something
really stupid today.

23:26.570 --> 23:29.562
So, um...

23:29.600 --> 23:31.659
My friends and I,

23:31.710 --> 23:35.168
we were in a clothing
store and...

23:35.210 --> 23:38.509
I got caught with some stuff
that I didn't pay for.

23:38.550 --> 23:40.916
- You're kidding me.

23:40.950 --> 23:42.941
- Look, my friends, they...

23:42.980 --> 23:45.187
they took some sweaters
and they dropped it in my bag

23:45.220 --> 23:47.688
and I was too afraid
to say anything.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.984
- Some friends.
- Were these friends Ariel

23:50.020 --> 23:52.659
and Cianna? 'Cause their parents
are getting a phone call right--

23:52.690 --> 23:54.829
- No, Dad, please don't.

23:54.860 --> 23:58.193
OK? I just want to forget
that today ever happened.

23:58.230 --> 24:00.221
- No, honey, you can't
just forget it!

24:00.270 --> 24:03.660
They need to know that they made
a big mistake when they took
advantage of you.

24:03.710 --> 24:06.133
- You know, Matt...

24:06.170 --> 24:08.934
I used to get all
riled at your coaches.

24:08.980 --> 24:11.141
I'd be halfway
down the driveway,

24:11.180 --> 24:13.671
plans for mayhem in my head,

24:13.720 --> 24:17.781
until I realized the impact
my actions had on you.

24:19.790 --> 24:21.985
- Alright. We can put
a pin in this...

24:22.020 --> 24:24.022
for now.

24:26.990 --> 24:30.619
I think I know what'll make you
feel better, honey. You want
some roclq road ice cream?

24:30.670 --> 24:32.968
- Um...

24:33.000 --> 24:35.935
Thanks, Dad, but I don't really
have an appetite right now.

24:42.140 --> 24:46.042
- It's not like Jules
to turn down ice cream.

24:46.080 --> 24:48.776
***

24:48.820 --> 24:52.119
- Bringing a drug dealer
in off the street

24:52.150 --> 24:54.118
is not considered
a felony, Angie.

24:54.160 --> 24:56.116
Obstructing an active police
investigation, however--

24:56.160 --> 24:58.253
- Just run Jay's profile.
- I did. He's not in the system.

24:58.290 --> 25:00.622
You're chasing your own tail.
- We know Jay's a CI.

25:00.660 --> 25:03.128
If he's not in the system, then
some rogue cop's running him

25:03.160 --> 25:05.264
off-book, and that is a felony.

25:05.300 --> 25:07.996
- He gave a false name.
Hence the off-book part.

25:08.040 --> 25:10.190
- Wow.
- I know yours

25:10.240 --> 25:12.128
is an impossible job,
but this cop has a body count.

25:12.170 --> 25:15.003
It could get worse. It stinks,
Kurtis, you know it does.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.270
- All I know is you guys have
the Karaoke Kid as a client,

25:17.310 --> 25:19.278
and you're the one
inhaling the fumes.

25:19.310 --> 25:22.211
- Wait. Your salsa-dancing,
drug-dealing man crush,

25:22.250 --> 25:24.616
Edgar Brava. Who else
likes his chubby cheeks?

25:24.650 --> 25:28.279
- Pretty much everyone.
The Four Horsemen in particular.

25:28.320 --> 25:30.925
- The Drug Squad dream team.

25:34.260 --> 25:36.148
- That's him.
That's the guy I saw, Maz.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.065
- You don't.

25:38.100 --> 25:40.295
There's untouchable and
then there's Tyler Pryce.

25:40.330 --> 25:43.902
- But I saw him.
If he's running a rogue
operation, if kids are dying--

25:43.940 --> 25:47.159
- Tyler Pryce is a legend.
He's nailed more bad
guys than Batman.

25:47.210 --> 25:50.839
- Teddy Borges was not a bad guy
and Teddy Borges is dead.

25:50.880 --> 25:53.041
I don't want Jay to be next.

25:53.080 --> 25:56.174
- You are going on
the paranoid ramblings
of a half-baked hipster.

25:56.220 --> 25:58.188
- We're going on more than that.
We saw what Jay was buying.

25:58.220 --> 26:00.950
We saw him turn
it over to Pryce.

26:03.860 --> 26:06.829
- Angie, I would do anything
for you, but I can't
touch this thing.

26:06.860 --> 26:08.851
- If this was a police
operation, wouldn't there be

26:08.900 --> 26:11.664
some kind of evidence?
- Evidence. Shade's right.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.930
Jay bought cocaine
and a handgun,

26:13.970 --> 26:15.938
which he turned over to Pryce.
So if it's on the book,

26:15.970 --> 26:18.006
it's in the records.
Call Evidence.

26:18.040 --> 26:20.258
- And what do I tell Evidence
that I'm looking for?

26:20.310 --> 26:24.679
Cops don't look into other cops,
Angie. You of all people
should know that.

26:24.710 --> 26:27.975
- You're a good cop, Maz.
Enjoy that promotion.

26:35.990 --> 26:38.959
- I'm sorry, buddy, but we're
running out of options.

26:38.990 --> 26:42.255
- A lavwer can help. Just tell
them everything you told us.

26:42.300 --> 26:45.292
- Pryce said no lawyers
or the charges stick.

26:47.300 --> 26:49.268
There's gotta be something.

26:49.300 --> 26:51.268
- Unless we can
get a cop on5ide,

26:51.310 --> 26:53.631
there's not really
much we can do.

26:53.680 --> 26:55.830
- Alright, listen. There's only

26:55.880 --> 26:57.905
one way to do this thing.
If we take down Pryce,

26:57.950 --> 27:00.305
then we, the cops, could lose
a chance to take down Tyrell,

27:00.350 --> 27:02.375
and Tyrell is scum.
- Oh, it's OK.

27:02.420 --> 27:04.285
Maz, this is Jay.

27:04.320 --> 27:06.788
Detective Mazhari.

27:06.820 --> 27:08.981
- No. You're in.

27:09.020 --> 27:11.386
- I love this man right now. If
you're not having sex with him,

27:11.430 --> 27:14.251
then I will.
- I'm regretting this already.

27:14.300 --> 27:17.861
Or whatever his name is?
- Tyler Pryce.

27:17.900 --> 27:19.720
And yeah, we're going after him.

27:19.770 --> 27:22.261
- Pryce is not the kind of man

27:22.300 --> 27:25.007
to let a loose end dangle.

27:25.040 --> 27:28.077
- Then what say
you make me the knot?

27:34.950 --> 27:38.738
- Just play it cool and
remember to breathe, alright?

27:38.790 --> 27:42.282
Out of the way, come on.
- Seriously, man, I'm not
a flight risk.

27:42.320 --> 27:44.322
- I'd say you're flying
pretty high already, punk.

27:51.330 --> 27:54.231
Hey, Pryce.

27:54.270 --> 27:57.364
Can I help you with something?

27:57.400 --> 27:59.800
Didn't know you had to make
bottom-feeder quota.

27:59.840 --> 28:02.377
- This kid just lit up
right in front of me.

28:02.410 --> 28:04.970
- Look, I know this punk.
Let me have a go.

28:05.010 --> 28:06.978
- I don't like
handing things off.

28:07.010 --> 28:10.377
- I'll save you the paperwork.

28:12.390 --> 28:14.881
- You just said the magic words.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.796
- Nice work, Maz.

28:23.830 --> 28:25.718
- Now we just gotta hope
that Pryce doesn't see

28:25.770 --> 28:27.931
the red recording light.
- You and I had a deal.

28:27.970 --> 28:32.339
You do as I say, lay low,
and I help you out.

28:32.370 --> 28:34.406
- I'm still waiting for
the "help" part to kick in.

28:34.440 --> 28:36.829
- What were you thinking,
lighting up in front of him?

28:36.880 --> 28:39.348
- How was I supposed to know
the guy was under

28:39.380 --> 28:42.178
- Keep it together, Jay.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.210
- I found out a friend
of mine died.

28:46.250 --> 28:49.356
Teddy Borges.

28:49.390 --> 28:52.359
He was shot twice in the head.

28:52.390 --> 28:55.359
I c-couldn't help
but wonder if he was...

28:55.400 --> 28:58.221
- W-working for you, too.

28:58.270 --> 29:01.967
Why is that?

29:02.000 --> 29:04.400
- My friend is dead.

29:04.440 --> 29:07.830
And I get the feeling you
wouldn't care if the same
thing happened to me.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.178
- No, we got nothing.

29:10.210 --> 29:12.405
Pryce has to actually
incriminate himself.

29:22.320 --> 29:25.380
- I am so close with Tyrell.
- He's gonna see the red
recording light.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.853
- Just one deal and he's ours.

29:27.900 --> 29:30.198
And you're the man who can
make that deal happen.

29:30.230 --> 29:32.790
- No, Jay's blocking him.

29:32.830 --> 29:34.866
- How'd you know Teddy
was shot twice in the head?

29:34.900 --> 29:38.028
How'd you know that?
- I spoke to his cousin.

29:38.070 --> 29:40.004
She told me.

29:40.040 --> 29:42.929
Look, you said the meeting in
the karaoke bar was my last,

29:42.980 --> 29:45.301
just like you said
the meeting before

29:45.350 --> 29:47.341
was the last and
the one before that.

29:47.380 --> 29:50.315
- Atta boy, Jay, you got this.
- Just one last deal.

29:50.350 --> 29:53.148
This one last thing and that's
it. It's the big one. It's the
one you've been working for.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.455
- Um...
- I thought it was the bathroom.

29:57.490 --> 30:00.288
- Nolan, just hear me out
for a second, OK?

30:03.260 --> 30:05.364
- Pryce is running
C.I.s off the books.

30:07.170 --> 30:10.901
- Look, we have a rogue cop on
our hands and we're right on
the verge of getting some--

30:10.940 --> 30:12.828
- No, whatever you think
you had would never stick,

30:12.870 --> 30:15.304
'cause you've got civilians
in the interview room.

30:15.340 --> 30:17.376
- Uh, Pryce is leaving with Jay.
- Come on, Maz.

30:17.410 --> 30:19.605
You know better than that.
You're killing me.

30:19.650 --> 30:22.312
- We're trying to stop that cop
from getting another kid killed!

30:22.350 --> 30:25.444
Who
deputized any of you to do that?

30:25.490 --> 30:28.311
You realize this right here is
enough to torch your promotion?

30:28.360 --> 30:30.419
- So be it.

30:33.090 --> 30:36.093
- We've breached protocol,
but Jay's in real danger, OK?

30:36.130 --> 30:38.098
Pryce is gunning so hard
for Tyrell that he's lost

30:38.130 --> 30:40.121
complete perspective of this--
- You don't get to tell me

30:40.170 --> 30:42.536
how to conduct police business.
- I'm sorry, but one young C.I.

30:42.570 --> 30:45.232
has already lost his life.
- Nolan, it was my decision.

30:45.270 --> 30:47.329
- Even if it wasn't,
it's going to land on you.

30:47.370 --> 30:50.271
Listen, I know you P.I.s
like to work the fringes,

30:50.310 --> 30:52.278
so maybe you thought you had
to go behind my back. But look,

30:52.310 --> 30:54.278
next time, overcome

30:54.320 --> 30:56.276
your natural impulses
and just come and talk to me.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.481
OK, look. I did some digging.

30:58.520 --> 31:02.957
Teddy Borges, found in a field
with two bullets in his head.

31:02.990 --> 31:06.380
Lisa Millegrew, 25.
She's a Forest Hill party girl

31:06.430 --> 31:09.228
whose Molly habit ended when her
body showed up at Cherry Beach.

31:09.260 --> 31:11.490
You see a pattern here?

31:11.530 --> 31:13.896
- Recreational users.

31:13.940 --> 31:15.669
- Both shot in the head, both
dumped in remote locations.

31:15.700 --> 31:18.430
- And both
confidential informants

31:18.470 --> 31:20.563
for a man who rides
his horses until they drop.

31:20.610 --> 31:23.977
I'll just wait out here.

31:24.010 --> 31:26.103
- Just get in here.
- OK.

31:26.150 --> 31:28.971
- Now, look. These two don't
show up on the CI. list,

31:29.020 --> 31:31.443
but I talked to a few
officers that I trust.

31:31.490 --> 31:33.515
Pryce was seen with
each of these victims...

31:33.550 --> 31:35.552
...on at least one OCCElSiOH.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.385
I got a line on Jay.

31:40.430 --> 31:43.126
Looks like he's driving
down Geary Avenue.

31:43.160 --> 31:45.162
I let him put some
apps on my phone.

31:45.200 --> 31:47.168
- Pryce must have had Jay set up
another buy with Tyrell.

31:47.200 --> 31:50.260
He's moving into Tyrell's turf.
- His third buy in two days.

31:50.300 --> 31:53.269
- Pryce wants this too much.
Tyrell's gonna know
something's up.

31:53.310 --> 31:55.175
- If he finds out this kid
is wearing a Wire...

31:55.210 --> 31:57.428
- Derek, you can't let
another file like this

31:57.480 --> 32:00.677
come across your desk.

32:00.710 --> 32:03.440
- Alright, fine.
But let's be clear:

32:03.480 --> 32:06.040
I am the lead on this.
- Fine, you're the boss.

32:12.060 --> 32:14.551
Sort of surprised you wanted
to partner up with me.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.057
- I like to keep
the wild cards close.

32:19.100 --> 32:21.239
- Yeah, Everett hates it
when I use the word partner too.

32:21.270 --> 32:23.329
Keeps calling me her employee.

32:23.370 --> 32:25.338
- Well, she likes things
as she likes things.

32:25.370 --> 32:28.578
- You mean everything
in its place.
- And everyone.

32:28.610 --> 32:30.578
Well, she opened up the door
to you pretty quick.

32:30.610 --> 32:34.319
- It's all in how you knock.

32:34.350 --> 32:37.239
- Keep navigating
there, brother.

32:39.420 --> 32:42.309
- Yeah, you got it.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.351
- What do you think they're
talking about over there?

32:44.390 --> 32:47.052
- I don't care.
- Sports.

32:47.090 --> 32:49.320
You know, politics.

32:49.360 --> 32:52.067
Women, maybe? Like,

32:52.100 --> 32:55.069
_ women _co
Like, speCIfically,

32:55.100 --> 32:58.501
which of them likes a certain
woman co

32:58.540 --> 33:01.134
: Nolan told you,
didn't he?

33:01.180 --> 33:03.330
- No, but you just did.

33:03.380 --> 33:06.474
- Oh, you're an idiot.

33:06.510 --> 33:08.614
- Did you know
Pryce was corrupt?

33:08.650 --> 33:12.086
- That's a dangerous
word to throw around.

33:12.120 --> 33:14.088
Pryce was a good guy
for a long time.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.611
It's just, you know, sometimes
even good cops can go Ahab.

33:19.260 --> 33:22.354
- Didn't take you
for a literary man.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.789
- Yeah, I saw it
on the Simpsons.

33:24.830 --> 33:26.798
- It's just, it's an
imperfect system is all.

33:26.830 --> 33:29.560
See a lot of bad guys get away.
- Any way we can make sure

33:29.600 --> 33:32.501
that doesn't happen here?

33:32.540 --> 33:36.237
- Let's see about that.

33:36.280 --> 33:39.249
***

33:39.280 --> 33:41.248
- This is it.

33:41.280 --> 33:44.249
: You're late.
: I don't wear a watch.

33:44.290 --> 33:47.544
Feels too much like handcuffs.
- Backup to Geary and Bristol.

33:47.590 --> 33:50.115
Four cars at least. Hey, hey!

33:50.160 --> 33:52.128
Keep this call off the radio.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.821
- You didn't say that
Pryce followed him here

33:53.860 --> 33:55.828
and that we followed Pryce.
- They'll figure it out

33:55.860 --> 33:58.397
soon enough. That auto
shop is Tyrell's HQ.

33:58.430 --> 34:00.398
- Jay is in there,
wearing a wire!

34:00.430 --> 34:02.739
- Which is why we're here,
keeping a safe distance away.

34:02.770 --> 34:04.738
- We can't protect
him from here.

34:04.770 --> 34:07.409
And you know Pryce
isn't going to.

34:07.440 --> 34:11.069
- Alright. You stay put.
Don't do a damn thing.

34:11.110 --> 34:13.101
Backup's on its way.

34:17.380 --> 34:19.814
- Serious weight
for a kid like you.

34:19.850 --> 34:24.321
- Dude, never open a bar.
The b-bills are unbelievable.

34:24.360 --> 34:26.749
Every time I turn around,

34:26.790 --> 34:28.758
there's someone
with their hand out...

34:28.800 --> 34:31.462
- Get gone.

34:33.330 --> 34:35.298
You're that drunk
idiot from the bar.

34:35.340 --> 34:37.865
- And you're endangering
a civilian, again.

34:37.900 --> 34:39.538
Are you on the job?

34:39.570 --> 34:43.609
- I'm a private investigator.
- Then the only civilian you
should be worried about

34:43.640 --> 34:46.473
right now is you. Get the hell
away. This is a police matter.

34:46.510 --> 34:50.116
- Then we should notify them.
- You can kiss that promotion
goodbye, Mazhari.

34:50.150 --> 34:52.448
- The thing about Hayek

34:52.490 --> 34:56.586
is his economic theories
foster independence.

34:56.620 --> 34:59.327
So it's odd how quickly
you'd want to come play with us.

34:59.360 --> 35:03.228
I started to ask myself,

35:03.260 --> 35:06.798
why would that be?

35:06.830 --> 35:08.798
- We know you've got Jay
as an unregistered C.I.

35:08.840 --> 35:11.400
- Just like Lisa Millegrew--
- And Teddy Borges.

35:11.440 --> 35:15.206
- Look, Mazhari, I got a chance
to take down Simon Tyrell.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.401
He's the real killer._
- And you're the one setting up

35:17.440 --> 35:19.874
civilians as his targets!
- They were criminals.
They knew the risk.

35:19.910 --> 35:22.777
- They were kids being exploited
on two-bit charges.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.811
Seriously?

35:28.860 --> 35:31.385
Hey, hey, hands off!
Hey! Hey!

35:33.430 --> 35:36.490
- Jay's been made.
- It's Tyrell. This
is my only chance.

35:39.270 --> 35:42.831
Or Lisa?

35:54.420 --> 35:57.548
- You disappoint me, Jay.

36:04.690 --> 36:07.250
Who the hell are you?

36:07.290 --> 36:09.258
- I'm a... I'm just
a friend of Jay's.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.393
We were supposed
to brew up some Kombucha.

36:11.430 --> 36:14.433
He was taking forever!

36:14.470 --> 36:17.530
- Uh... also Kombucha club.

36:17.570 --> 36:20.403
Nothing to see.

36:20.440 --> 36:23.432
Angie, Angie, get down.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.607
- POLICE! Drop the weapon, now!

36:25.650 --> 36:28.312
Put the gun down, now!

36:28.350 --> 36:31.319
- You heard the man.

36:33.620 --> 36:37.283
- Drop the weapon, now.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.289
Get down. Get down, now!

36:40.330 --> 36:42.890
Over here!

36:42.930 --> 36:45.296
- Hands behind your back!
: Get down.

36:45.330 --> 36:48.731
You're under arrest.

36:54.340 --> 36:57.434
- Nice work. Detective Sergeant.

37:07.550 --> 37:09.450
- It is.

37:09.490 --> 37:12.584
- Yeah, then I'm OK.

37:12.630 --> 37:15.497
- Shade, you idiot!

37:15.530 --> 37:18.522
- Except I think
he just saved my life.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.391
- Well, yeah, but if he would
have got shot, I...

37:25.040 --> 37:26.860
I pay his wages
a week in advance.

37:26.910 --> 37:28.878
- Right.

37:28.910 --> 37:30.798
- Let's get you out of here.

37:30.840 --> 37:33.638
- Come on.

37:38.080 --> 37:40.514
: Morning.
: Morning.

37:40.550 --> 37:42.780
- You know what I was thinking
about this morning?

37:42.820 --> 37:45.687
"Play the right way,
not the easy way."

37:45.730 --> 37:49.052
Still got that code
on your necklace?

37:49.100 --> 37:52.558
- I didn't put it on today.
- Yeah, I noticed.

37:52.600 --> 37:55.535
Something you want to tell me?

37:55.570 --> 37:57.788
- I was the shoplifter.

38:00.570 --> 38:03.038
No one made me.

38:03.080 --> 38:06.641
I guess I just wanted to show
the other girls how cool
I was or something.

38:06.680 --> 38:09.376
- Uh-huh.

38:09.420 --> 38:12.583
- It was the stupidest
mistake I've ever made.

38:14.560 --> 38:16.585
- That's not a mistake, honey.

38:16.620 --> 38:20.386
That's a decision.

38:20.430 --> 38:23.558
The mistake would_be
not learning from it.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.524
- I'm sorry I lied to you.

38:26.570 --> 38:28.834
- Yeah, I am too.

38:38.580 --> 38:40.798
Hang onto this.

38:40.850 --> 38:44.684
Maybe it'll stop you from
making a bigger mistake.

38:44.720 --> 38:48.451
'Cause if you're anything
like me, they're coming.

38:51.530 --> 38:53.953
Even though I got arrested?

38:53.990 --> 38:57.721
- Yeah, honey. We're OK.

38:57.760 --> 38:59.864
I love you.

39:02.470 --> 39:04.461
You'll be doing the dishes
for the rest of your life,

39:04.510 --> 39:06.535
but we're OK.

39:08.510 --> 39:11.479
Wait a second.
If you got arrested,

39:11.510 --> 39:14.149
how did you convince Grandpa
to keep his mouth shut?

39:14.180 --> 39:18.640
- I... didn't call Grandpa.

39:27.090 --> 39:30.389
- Huh. Your dad's office.

39:30.430 --> 39:32.398
What's going on in here?

39:32.430 --> 39:35.467
- Oh, I just... thought
I should tidy up a bit.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.730
Put a few things away.

39:39.810 --> 39:43.132
- I asked Mazhari to come over
and help me the other night,

39:43.180 --> 39:45.501
but I couldn't do it.

39:45.550 --> 39:47.745
Ijammed up.

39:47.780 --> 39:50.874
I think I need to
do it on my own.

39:50.920 --> 39:53.081
- Alright, I can respect that.

39:53.120 --> 39:55.611
Well, if you change your mind...

39:55.660 --> 39:57.787
- Thanks.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.528
- It's great when co-workers

40:03.560 --> 40:05.528
can be honest with
each other, don't you think?

40:05.570 --> 40:09.062
- Uh, look. The other day,
Jules, she called me--

40:09.100 --> 40:11.898
- Yeah, I know. It's OK.

40:11.940 --> 40:14.067
- I figured it out.

40:14.110 --> 40:17.637
Truth is, I'm glad she feels
like she can call you.

40:17.680 --> 40:20.649
- She swore me to secrecy
and I wanted to honour it,

40:20.680 --> 40:22.511
but I was torn up. I mean,

40:22.550 --> 40:24.814
you're my partner, so...

40:24.850 --> 40:27.546
What?

40:27.590 --> 40:31.048
- You called me your partner!

40:31.090 --> 40:34.548
(song: Sweet Home Alabama
by Lynyrd Slqnyrd)

40:37.700 --> 40:41.659
: ** Well, I hope
Neil Young will remember *

40:41.700 --> 40:43.930
- I never thought that
a woman so beautiful

40:43.970 --> 40:47.462
could make sounds like that.

40:47.510 --> 40:49.671
- * Sweet home Alabama

40:49.710 --> 40:52.804
- Every accomplishment starts
with a decision to try.

40:52.850 --> 40:56.616
- Sports analogies are not
going to save us here.

40:56.650 --> 40:58.618
- No. No.

40:58.650 --> 41:01.710
- * Sweet home Alabama
Woo!

41:03.590 --> 41:06.718
* Lord, I'm coming home to you

41:06.760 --> 41:09.251
- Hey, Jay, you got off
with a pretty clean slate, huh?

41:09.300 --> 41:11.564
- Pryce kept you out of the
system, so your record's clean.

41:11.600 --> 41:15.263
- I'm a solid citizen, guys.

41:15.300 --> 41:19.600
- I know. Yeah, I know.
Adele's career is safe.

41:21.880 --> 41:24.178
Oh, my God.
We're so doing this one.

41:24.210 --> 41:26.872
Guys, come on. You know
you want to. Come on!

41:26.910 --> 41:29.572
*** _
- I got a throat thing, I can't.

41:29.620 --> 41:31.918
- Oh, no, I'm good.

41:31.950 --> 41:34.851
- Come on. Surely one of you
is man enough to play.

41:34.890 --> 41:37.256
Seriously?

41:37.290 --> 41:38.757
- Come on, guys.

41:38.790 --> 41:40.883
You'll face down guns
but can't pick up a mic?

41:40.930 --> 41:43.899
I'm going in.

41:48.030 --> 41:50.897
***

41:50.940 --> 41:54.603
** Then I spent so many nights
thinking how you did me wrong *

41:54.640 --> 41:58.872
* And I grew strong
And I learned how to get along *

41:58.910 --> 42:02.744
* And now you're back
from outer space *

42:02.780 --> 42:05.283
* J_ust walked in
to find you here *

42:05.320 --> 42:07.743
* With that sad look
upon your face *

42:07.790 --> 42:10.554
* Should have changed
that stupid lock *

42:10.590 --> 42:13.559
* Made you leave you key
- Didn't see that coming.

42:13.590 --> 42:16.696
- * You'd be back to bother me
Go on now, go *

42:16.730 --> 42:19.665
- All this time you had me
convinced it was you and...

42:21.970 --> 42:24.336
- I have no_idea what
you're talking about.

42:24.370 --> 42:26.167
- I can't say I blame you.
I mean, look at the guy.

42:26.210 --> 42:28.633
- What did you and Nolan
talk about in the car?

42:28.680 --> 42:31.035
- Don't worry, he didn't
tell me. I did, of course,

42:31.080 --> 42:33.344
P.I. the crap out of him.
I am good at my job.

42:33.380 --> 42:35.644
- * I will survive

42:35.680 --> 42:38.683
- You are. But I'm not going to
take any flak from you over--

42:40.950 --> 42:44.659
- I had no idea you were
so hung up on labels.

42:44.690 --> 42:46.681
- I am not hung up.

42:46.730 --> 42:48.721
On labels.

42:48.760 --> 42:51.695
- * Come on and get
Come sing it with me *

42:51.730 --> 42:54.119
- No... No!

42:54.170 --> 42:56.365
Too afraid *

42:56.400 --> 42:58.709
- I'm just gonna wreck it!

42:58.740 --> 43:00.662
: * Weren't you the one
who tried to break me *

43:00.710 --> 43:03.133
- I don't think_
I'M gomg to survwe.

43:03.180 --> 43:05.876
- What doesn't
kill us makes us...

43:07.880 --> 43:09.848
- You keep being
stronger, brother.

43:09.880 --> 43:11.814
- * IfI had known
for just one second *

43:11.850 --> 43:13.989
- * You'd be back to bother me

43:14.020 --> 43:17.353
- * Go on now, go
Walk out the door *

43:17.390 --> 43:19.381
- Come on, Shade!
We're all friends here.

43:19.430 --> 43:23.628
- Yeah, let's keep it that way.
- * Just turn around now

43:23.660 --> 43:25.821
* 'Cause you're not
welcome anymore *

43:25.870 --> 43:28.293
_ : * Now I'm_
savmg all my lovmg *

43:28.330 --> 43:30.298
* For someone who's loving me

43:30.340 --> 43:33.707

Walk out the door *

43:33.740 --> 43:38.404
* Just turn around now, 'cause
you're not welcome anymore *

43:38.440 --> 43:42.171
* Weren't you the one who tried
to break me with goodbye *

43:42.220 --> 43:44.279
* Did you think I'd crumble

43:44.320 --> 43:47.118
* Did you think
I'd lay down and die *

43:47.150 --> 43:50.711
* Oh, no, not I
I will survive *

43:50.760 --> 43:53.729

I know how to love *

43:53.760 --> 43:57.127
