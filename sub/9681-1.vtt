is writing his memoirs.

Do you wanna be?

28:51.176 --> 28:52.810
Do you?

28:52.812 --> 28:56.481
Of course. You were all
a part of your father's life.

28:57.916 --> 28:59.884
Why are you talking to me
in the third person?

28:59.886 --> 29:01.853
Well, I... I don't...

29:01.855 --> 29:04.021
Because I'm writing
about myself, I suppose.

29:04.023 --> 29:05.257
Why, doesn't it suit you?

29:08.060 --> 29:11.630
I thought you might like these.

on the lake.

Oh, come on.

for God's sake?

29:37.023 --> 29:39.157
Come on.

29:39.159 --> 29:42.226

Where have you been?

29:42.228 --> 29:43.861

No.

making out with.

53:43.802 --> 53:45.168
I ran away from home

53:45.170 --> 53:48.972
and, uh, went to San Francisco
so I could go live with him.

53:50.775 --> 53:54.277

It drinks the same light.

01:04:59.377 --> 01:05:03.046
Meier designed
a series of louvered skylights

01:05:03.048 --> 01:05:04.513
to capture that light

01:05:04.515 --> 01:05:07.617
and cast it inward
to illuminate the art within,

01:05:07.619 --> 01:05:09.518
but indirectly.

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.754
And that was important,

01:05:10.756 --> 01:05:14.323
because although light
enhances art,

01:05:14.325 --> 01:05:16.059
it can also degrade it.

01:05:16.061 --> 01:05:18.561

Now, come on.

01:05:32.043 --> 01:05:34.744
You know as well as I do
that the light in Barcelona

01:05:34.746 --> 01:05:37.446
is quite different
from the light in Tokyo.

01:05:37.448 --> 01:05:40.750

different from that in Prague.

takes that into account.
