00:02.752 --> 00:05.686
This is what happens when you
miss an episode of "Shameless."

00:05.721 --> 00:08.389
Your entire life goes
completely to shit.

00:10.059 --> 00:11.725
<i>Anyone try to find me</i>

00:11.761 --> 00:14.585
when I was in the
ICU for the last month?

00:14.586 --> 00:15.987
We were kind of hoping you were dead.

00:15.988 --> 00:17.010
- <i>You good?</i>

00:17.011 --> 00:18.377
- <i>I learned I'm not an alcoholic.</i>

00:18.401 --> 00:19.700
What about finishing college?

00:19.735 --> 00:21.635
- Is that off the table?
- I got a professor.

00:21.671 --> 00:23.816
Uh, he's gonna help me
find something... a tech startup.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.918
It just might be a while before
I get paid, you know?

00:25.942 --> 00:27.675
This management
thing is a pain in my ass.

00:27.710 --> 00:29.009
I'm losing money.

00:29.045 --> 00:30.345
Tell you what. Pay yourself

00:30.346 --> 00:32.223
an extra 50Â¢ an hour,
make up the difference.

00:32.247 --> 00:34.081
- An extra buck an hour.
- Done.

00:36.285 --> 00:38.552
Nice stroller. Where'd you get it?

00:38.588 --> 00:40.855
- <i>Oh, I found it in
the park, I'm gonna sell it.</i>

00:40.890 --> 00:43.157
Dom won't go down on me
'cause I'm not circumcised.

00:43.192 --> 00:46.660
It has all this extra skin,
and it kind of freaks me out.

00:46.696 --> 00:48.095
I can't feel a thing.

00:48.130 --> 00:49.530
- Don't worry.

00:49.565 --> 00:51.498
You will soon.

00:51.534 --> 00:53.734
I'm meeting an old high
school friend for dinner.

00:53.769 --> 00:55.180
- <i>An old friend?</i>
- <i>Denise.</i>

00:55.204 --> 00:57.404
Please tell me she has a dick.

00:57.440 --> 01:00.074
You have no balance sheet, no
income or cash flow forecast.

01:00.109 --> 01:03.077
Our yield on gross revenues are shit.

01:03.112 --> 01:04.879
Are we seriously not gonna have sex?

01:04.914 --> 01:06.247
'Cause I kind of took a Viagra.

01:07.884 --> 01:10.751
Oh, yeah, just walk right
by, ignore your father

01:10.786 --> 01:13.454
<i>that you tried to drown in the river.</i>

01:13.489 --> 01:16.090
<i>I was only telling the truth!</i>

02:33.113 --> 02:34.346
<i>Come on, Frank!</i>

02:38.485 --> 02:39.618
<i>Open the door.</i>

02:45.325 --> 02:46.625
Hey, Hector?

02:46.660 --> 02:48.226
Hi, it's Fiona.

02:48.262 --> 02:49.661
Oh, shit. Hang on!

02:52.099 --> 02:53.865
Hi, you still there?

02:53.901 --> 02:55.634
Sorry. Uh...

02:55.669 --> 02:56.902
Can you work today?

02:56.937 --> 02:58.970
Santos called in sick again.

02:59.006 --> 03:02.774
Yeah, I'm tired of his bullshit, too.

03:02.809 --> 03:04.376
You can?

03:04.411 --> 03:05.610
Oh, that's great. Okay.

03:05.646 --> 03:07.612
I'll see you at ten.

03:19.326 --> 03:21.293
I thought you were living at Caleb's?

03:21.328 --> 03:22.994
Caleb's sleeping with a chick.

03:23.030 --> 03:25.597
- He's bi?
- No dude is bi, all right?

03:25.632 --> 03:27.399
You lick dick, you're
supposed to be gay.

03:27.434 --> 03:29.768
So you guys broke up?

03:29.803 --> 03:32.070
Haven't decided yet. Probably.

03:32.105 --> 03:34.773
God, I can't believe
he's licking vag, too.

03:34.808 --> 03:37.842
All right, can you guys please
stop talking about licking vag?

03:38.143 --> 03:40.288
- You're gonna give me a boner.
- You sleep at all last night?

03:40.312 --> 03:42.946
No, if I wake up with morning
wood, it'll pop my stitches.

03:42.981 --> 03:45.782
You're 16. How are you
gonna not get wood for 72 hours?

03:45.817 --> 03:47.517
Eyes on the prize, my brother.

03:47.552 --> 03:48.851
Yeah, which is?

03:48.887 --> 03:50.753
A blowie from Dominique.

03:50.789 --> 03:53.223
The chick who made you cut your dick?

03:53.258 --> 03:55.024
Yeah, man, no girl's worth that.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.392
She didn't make me.

03:56.428 --> 03:58.027
I wanted to.

03:58.063 --> 04:00.196
You guys just don't
understand true love.

04:00.232 --> 04:01.864
Uh, you know, it's
pretty cold out there.

04:01.900 --> 04:03.433
You better put on a turtleneck.

04:03.468 --> 04:05.435
Oh, oh! Excuse you.

04:05.470 --> 04:07.882
Oh, you got to forgive Carl,
his manners were in his foreskin.

04:07.906 --> 04:10.139
Uh, stop it! It just
gives me the willies

04:10.175 --> 04:11.886
thinking about someone near
my junk with a knife.

04:11.910 --> 04:13.476
Where is my vacuum cleaner?

04:13.511 --> 04:16.946
- Upstairs probably.
- Kev, grab our cleaning shit.

04:16.982 --> 04:18.714
What's all that crap?

04:18.750 --> 04:20.950
I'm helping Fiona with the
bills over at Patsy's.

04:20.986 --> 04:22.652
Place is in a financial shitstorm.

04:22.687 --> 04:24.087
Yeah, the Alibi, too.

04:24.122 --> 04:26.122
Svetlana's getting things in order,

04:26.157 --> 04:28.324
which makes me the house husband.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.159
I keep forgetting about
the weird situation

04:30.195 --> 04:31.928
you got going on with the two wives.

04:31.963 --> 04:33.663
It's not weird. It's modern.

04:33.698 --> 04:35.565
You're gonna have to
draw me a Venn diagram

04:35.600 --> 04:36.933
to explain how that works.

04:36.968 --> 04:37.967
What's up with mopey?

04:38.003 --> 04:39.335
Ah, boy trouble.

04:39.371 --> 04:42.238
Girl trouble.

04:42.274 --> 04:45.742
I'll draw you a Venn
diagram to explain that, too.

04:45.777 --> 04:47.343
Where's my vacuum?

04:47.379 --> 04:48.444
What are you doing?

04:48.480 --> 04:50.446
Uh, vacuum, hall closet.

04:50.482 --> 04:52.081
And I'm getting rid of Frank's shit.

04:52.117 --> 04:53.983
That fuckhead's back in the house?

04:54.019 --> 04:57.186
Yeah, nailed the door
shut from the inside.

04:57.222 --> 04:59.122
- How's he getting in and out?
- I don't know.

04:59.157 --> 05:01.024
Window? Ladder?

05:01.059 --> 05:03.192
Get a restraining order on his ass.

05:03.228 --> 05:05.028
That would mean that I cared.

05:05.063 --> 05:06.796
And I don't anymore.

05:06.831 --> 05:09.699
Aren't you angry with him about
destroying your future?

05:13.305 --> 05:15.371
Did me a favor.

05:15.407 --> 05:18.241
Come on, help me
bring his crap downstairs.

05:21.012 --> 05:24.314
Good morning, my wasted sperms.

05:24.349 --> 05:25.982
Frank, you're walking.

05:26.017 --> 05:27.328
In a weird way, but you're walking.

05:27.352 --> 05:28.985
- Why don't you go away, Frank?

05:29.020 --> 05:31.521
Is that any way to greet
your soon to be ex-father?

05:31.556 --> 05:32.522
Ex-father?

05:32.557 --> 05:33.956
We would be so lucky.

05:33.992 --> 05:37.160
Filling out the paperwork to disinherit

05:37.195 --> 05:38.695
you
abortion-should-have-beens.

05:38.730 --> 05:39.829
Disinherit? Wow.

05:39.864 --> 05:41.230
So we don't get that jelly jar?

05:41.266 --> 05:42.810
- Or the three pieces of silverware

05:42.834 --> 05:43.911
you stole from the Ramada Inn?

05:43.935 --> 05:45.702
Or the shame and the embarrassment?

05:45.737 --> 05:47.203
Go ahead, joke all you like.

05:47.238 --> 05:49.305
But once my parental
rights are terminated,

05:49.341 --> 05:52.008
you can no longer use the
Gallagher family name.

05:52.043 --> 05:53.643
Hallelujah!

05:53.678 --> 05:56.879
I'm just gonna be like
Cher and go by Fiona.

05:56.915 --> 05:58.414
Here's your shit.

05:58.450 --> 05:59.916
I'm taking my room back.

05:59.951 --> 06:01.584
And I'm padlocking the house.

06:01.619 --> 06:03.386
Aw, you made me toast.

06:03.421 --> 06:05.555
Thanks.

06:05.590 --> 06:07.690
Buh-bye, got to go to work.

06:07.726 --> 06:09.726
You can't get rid of me that easily.

06:09.761 --> 06:12.328
Has she talked to anybody
about what happened at the wedding?

06:12.364 --> 06:14.163
- Not to me.
- Me neither.

06:14.199 --> 06:16.399
Tumors are repressed feelings, you know.

06:16.434 --> 06:19.102
- Come on. Liam, let's go.
- What?

06:19.137 --> 06:21.070
He's the only one that
stands a fighting chance

06:21.106 --> 06:22.772
to become a real Gallagher.

06:22.807 --> 06:24.970
- No fucking way!
- Eh, you can't just take him, Frank.

06:24.971 --> 06:27.377
Yes, I can. I'm his father.

06:27.412 --> 06:29.746
And he is staying in the will.

06:29.781 --> 06:32.582
Aren't you?

06:34.919 --> 06:37.286
Do you think, in his
own way, Frank's actually

06:37.322 --> 06:39.422
a pretty good dad?

06:39.457 --> 06:40.556
No.

06:40.592 --> 06:41.758
Jesus.

06:41.793 --> 06:43.226
- Well, look who it is...

06:43.261 --> 06:44.794
Beauty and the Beast.

06:44.829 --> 06:46.863
I'll leave it to you
two to figure out who's who.

06:46.898 --> 06:48.109
Too bad you're walking again, Frank.

06:48.133 --> 06:49.899
I was praying for permanent paralysis.

06:49.934 --> 06:51.367
Where'd you get the stroller, Debs?

06:51.403 --> 06:53.903
The only thing Monica and I could afford

06:53.938 --> 06:56.939
to stroll you guys around
in was a Kroger shopping cart.

06:56.975 --> 06:58.808
Hey, give me that! It's not yours.

06:58.843 --> 07:01.711
Well, apparently it's not yours either.

07:01.746 --> 07:03.579
- Ugh.
- Maureen Wilson.

07:03.615 --> 07:05.581
Looks like you
already cleaned out the cash,

07:05.617 --> 07:08.418
Little Orphan Angry, so, uh...

07:08.453 --> 07:09.652
I'll take the platinum.

07:09.687 --> 07:11.387
You can't do that, Frank!

07:11.423 --> 07:14.424
Should I call Ms. Wilson,
let her know you found it?

07:14.459 --> 07:16.225
Fine, take it. Careful, Liam.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.795
I used to think Frank
would be a real dad someday, too.

07:18.830 --> 07:22.098
You and that little spic you
sneezed out of the cavern

07:22.133 --> 07:24.267
you called your
uterus better start looking

07:24.302 --> 07:25.501
for a new last name.

07:25.537 --> 07:27.270
I'm disinheriting both of you

07:27.305 --> 07:28.682
and taking back the Gallagher name.

07:28.706 --> 07:30.173
Gladly.

07:30.208 --> 07:32.241
And while I'm at it, Franny's gonna go

07:32.277 --> 07:34.310
by her middle name from
now on... Harriet.

07:34.345 --> 07:36.479
Harry. So she has no
more connection to you.

07:36.514 --> 07:38.147
Harry!

07:38.183 --> 07:40.583
Well, that's a perfect
name for the diesel dyke

07:40.618 --> 07:42.852
she's gonna grow up to be someday.

07:42.887 --> 07:44.821
Come on, kid. We got work to do.

07:44.856 --> 07:46.622
- Hey, Carl.

07:46.658 --> 07:48.302
Hey, bunch of us are going
to the movies tonight.

07:48.326 --> 07:49.826
You want to come?

07:49.861 --> 07:51.961
I told you, I can't hang
out with you for 72 hours.

07:51.996 --> 07:53.541
Thought that meant we
just couldn't fool around?

07:53.565 --> 07:55.665
Even just being in your
vicinity gives me a boner.

07:55.700 --> 07:57.467
That's so sweet.

07:57.502 --> 07:58.534
Seriously, stop.

07:58.570 --> 08:00.636
Hey, freak fuck!

08:00.672 --> 08:03.339
Heard you got a tranny operation.

08:03.408 --> 08:05.174
I only told a couple of people.

08:05.210 --> 08:06.509
Got your penis chopped off.

08:06.544 --> 08:08.044
Now you're a lady.

08:08.079 --> 08:09.846
Not that you were that
far off to begin with.

08:09.881 --> 08:11.174
See you around, Bruce Jenner.

08:11.319 --> 08:13.527
Hey, Bruce Jenner was the
dude, so fuck you guys.

08:13.551 --> 08:15.117
Thanks for the compliment.

08:15.153 --> 08:16.719
Don't listen to them.

08:16.754 --> 08:18.554
Okay, I think you're
manly for what you did.

08:18.590 --> 08:22.658
And when the 72 hours
and one second is over,

08:22.694 --> 08:26.128
I'm gonna loosen your belt,

08:26.164 --> 08:27.864
then take off your pants...

08:27.899 --> 08:29.198
- No.
- Then your underwear.

08:29.234 --> 08:31.133
No, no, stop.

08:31.169 --> 08:33.568
- Then suck your lollipop.
- I'm serious.

08:33.605 --> 08:35.037
Oh, fuck.

08:35.073 --> 08:37.740
I thought you said I
just couldn't go near you?

08:37.775 --> 08:39.408
Where are you going? We have class.

08:39.443 --> 08:41.644
Doctor, clinic, now.

08:43.847 --> 08:45.915
That's a burger
well-done, with crispy fries,

08:45.950 --> 08:47.383
and a Denver omelet, extra ham.

08:47.418 --> 08:49.485
And let me get you a
refill on these sodas.

08:49.521 --> 08:51.754
Yeah.

08:51.789 --> 08:54.423
We'll get that cleared
up for you in just a sec.

08:54.459 --> 08:57.260
- You get my order on 14?
- Oh, yeah, I did.

08:57.295 --> 08:58.661
You're two hours late.

08:58.696 --> 09:01.664
I called Melinda. Said it wasn't busy.

09:01.699 --> 09:05.234
So you figured you'd just
come in whenever you felt like it?

09:05.270 --> 09:06.836
I had laundry to do.

09:06.871 --> 09:08.204
Melinda was cool with it.

09:09.741 --> 09:12.041
I'm glad you guys feel
like you can just change

09:12.076 --> 09:13.543
my schedule whenever you want.

09:13.578 --> 09:18.114
What Sean always let us do.

09:18.149 --> 09:21.450
In case you haven't
noticed, Sean's not here anymore.

09:21.486 --> 09:24.787
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, that's too bad.

09:24.822 --> 09:25.900
- Game Change, please hold.

09:25.924 --> 09:27.356
Phillip. Tito.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.025
- Senior intern.
- Hey. Nice to meet you.

09:29.060 --> 09:30.604
All right, follow
me, I'll show you around.

09:30.628 --> 09:32.161
Uh, you can start by getting coffee

09:32.196 --> 09:33.362
for the Three Musketeers.

09:33.398 --> 09:35.298
- Who?
- The owners, Phillip.

09:35.333 --> 09:36.799
- Two million!

09:41.739 --> 09:44.407
This is, uh, Sarah, head
of sales and marketing.

09:44.442 --> 09:46.475
Black coffee, extra hot, splash of 2%.

09:46.511 --> 09:49.111
Jesse, I buy ad space on
your stupid network every Sunday.

09:49.147 --> 09:51.714
Least you could do is cut
me a deal for the playoffs.

09:51.749 --> 09:53.983
Joe, brains behind the
operation and the VC guy.

09:54.018 --> 09:55.329
Raised the money to start this place.

09:55.353 --> 09:56.919
- He okay?
- Uh, new heated floors.

09:56.955 --> 09:58.387
- He gets cold.

09:58.423 --> 10:00.301
Green tea, steeped for three
minutes, one Truvia.

10:00.325 --> 10:01.591
Gene. Tech.

10:01.626 --> 10:03.659
Four double shots of
espresso before noon,

10:03.695 --> 10:05.940
wears a new pair of socks
every day, throws out the old ones.

10:05.964 --> 10:07.296
You'll help him put them on.

10:07.332 --> 10:08.809
He doesn't like to take the goggles off.

10:08.833 --> 10:10.132
- Copy that.
- Uh...

10:10.168 --> 10:11.634
Sign is self-explanatory.

10:11.669 --> 10:13.069
Kitchen is yours, too.

10:13.104 --> 10:14.682
There's a grocery
list on the bulletin board.

10:14.706 --> 10:15.816
- Three million!

10:15.840 --> 10:17.573
All right! Whoo!

10:20.144 --> 10:22.612
Hey, uh, listen, you get paid, you know,

10:22.647 --> 10:24.013
being the senior intern?

10:24.048 --> 10:26.282
No, um, but last senior
intern just got a job

10:26.317 --> 10:27.817
at Porsche marketing.

10:27.852 --> 10:31.754
100 grand a year, was only
here eight months, so...

10:31.789 --> 10:34.457
But you can get started with
the coffee and the tea.

10:34.492 --> 10:36.092
- Yeah.
- All right?

10:36.127 --> 10:37.493
And, Phillip? Um...

10:37.528 --> 10:40.529
get me an iced soy latte.

10:45.303 --> 10:47.136
<i>Home and garden, line four.</i>

10:47.171 --> 10:48.871
Buenos dÃ­as.

10:48.906 --> 10:50.539
Frank Gallagher.

10:50.575 --> 10:52.375
My son, Liam.

10:52.410 --> 10:54.110
Looking for some workers to help

10:54.145 --> 10:56.846
with a home masonry project.

10:56.881 --> 10:59.348
Pick three guys with a strong physique

10:59.384 --> 11:03.319
and a dumb disposition.

11:03.354 --> 11:06.956
- You, you, you.

11:06.991 --> 11:08.858
You make me proud, my one and only son.

11:08.893 --> 11:09.992
Very proud.

11:10.028 --> 11:12.728
Uh, the supplies I need.

11:14.365 --> 11:17.733
<i>Toby, report to hardware.</i>

11:17.769 --> 11:19.669
- Frank fucking Gallagher.

11:21.339 --> 11:22.905
You got money for once, Frank?

11:22.940 --> 11:24.507
Credit card.

11:24.542 --> 11:27.810
And could I get a $400 cash
advance on that card?

11:27.845 --> 11:30.046
And keep $100 for yourself.

11:30.081 --> 11:32.848
Whatever you say, Mrs. Wilson.

11:40.391 --> 11:42.391
Yo.

11:42.427 --> 11:44.393
How come you didn't come home last night

11:44.429 --> 11:46.262
or answer my texts?

11:46.297 --> 11:47.430
Busy.

11:50.101 --> 11:52.902
Care to elaborate?

11:52.937 --> 11:54.403
I don't know, ask Denise.

11:54.439 --> 11:56.205
Is that what this is about?

11:56.240 --> 11:57.373
My high school girlfriend?

11:57.374 --> 11:59.875
Your high school
girlfriend who you fuck.

11:59.911 --> 12:01.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What
are you talking about?

12:01.546 --> 12:04.080
- I saw you with her last night.
- You're spying on me?

12:04.115 --> 12:06.449
Yeah, 'cause I knew you'd
been cheating on me.

12:06.484 --> 12:08.017
I wasn't cheating.

12:08.052 --> 12:09.885
So you didn't fuck Denise, then?

12:09.921 --> 12:12.688
Cheating would be if I
sucked some guy's cock, all right?

12:12.724 --> 12:14.890
- So you didn't sleep with her?
- I didn't say that.

12:14.926 --> 12:16.637
- Well, I'm confused.
- How do you think I feel?

12:16.661 --> 12:18.038
You're the one calling me a cheater.

12:18.062 --> 12:19.273
You still haven't answered the question.

12:19.297 --> 12:22.264
Did you or did you not fuck Denise?

12:22.300 --> 12:25.601
- What's the big deal?
- What's the big deal?

12:25.636 --> 12:27.470
- She's an old friend.
- Who you fuck!

12:27.505 --> 12:29.316
We've been sleeping
together since we were kids.

12:29.340 --> 12:30.984
Don't make this into something
more than it is.

12:31.008 --> 12:32.208
You're taking your dick,

12:32.243 --> 12:33.976
you're putting it into a vagina.

12:34.011 --> 12:35.656
And you're telling me
you've never done that before?

12:35.680 --> 12:36.746
No, I haven't!

12:36.781 --> 12:38.981
- I'm gay.
- So am I!

12:39.016 --> 12:42.251
Sticking my dick in a friend's
vagina doesn't make me not gay.

12:42.286 --> 12:43.753
Are you hearing this, Raul?

12:43.788 --> 12:45.788
This is why I didn't want to tell you...

12:45.823 --> 12:47.134
Because I didn't want you freaking out

12:47.158 --> 12:48.257
the way you are right now.

12:48.292 --> 12:49.925
Oh, gee, sorry.

12:49.961 --> 12:52.061
Hey, how should I react when you say

12:52.096 --> 12:53.173
you've been screwing a woman?

12:53.197 --> 12:54.997
I don't know.

12:55.032 --> 12:57.600
Maybe by being more
accepting of your partner's normal,

12:57.635 --> 12:59.435
sexually fluid experiences,

12:59.470 --> 13:01.737
maybe by sharing some of your own.

13:01.773 --> 13:03.773
I don't have anything to share.

13:03.808 --> 13:05.508
I'm gay, all right?

13:05.543 --> 13:07.343
100% gay.

13:07.378 --> 13:10.346
- No one's 100% anything.
- Yeah, well, I am, all right?

13:10.381 --> 13:12.848
So now this inexperienced vagina-fucker

13:12.884 --> 13:15.684
has got to get to work.

13:20.858 --> 13:22.525
Uh, you Trisha?

13:22.560 --> 13:23.793
I am.

13:23.828 --> 13:25.394
It's brand-new.

13:43.047 --> 13:44.814
How much did you want, again?

13:44.849 --> 13:47.516
Like I said in the ad, at
the store, it's 2,500,

13:47.552 --> 13:49.451
but I can let it go for two.

13:49.487 --> 13:50.986
How about 1,500?

13:51.022 --> 13:52.555
You're haggling with me?

13:52.590 --> 13:55.191
Isn't that what Craigslist is all about?

13:55.226 --> 13:57.560
It's also about people
advertising baby stuff,

13:57.595 --> 13:59.795
and when the pregnant lady shows up,

13:59.831 --> 14:01.697
they cut the baby out of her stomach.

14:07.538 --> 14:09.305
- You doing all right?

14:09.340 --> 14:11.740
You're sewing on my penis, you tell me.

14:11.776 --> 14:15.377
You don't have a lot of undamaged
skin left down here.

14:15.413 --> 14:17.646
Yeah, because you chopped it all off.

14:17.682 --> 14:19.982
I warned you this would be difficult.

14:20.017 --> 14:22.651
It's harder than I
thought to not get an erection.

14:22.687 --> 14:25.588
You can get through this,
son. Just put your mind to it.

14:25.623 --> 14:28.490
I literally think about
sex 70,000 times a day.

14:28.526 --> 14:31.193
Have to find other things to focus on.

14:31.229 --> 14:33.095
Like what?

14:33.130 --> 14:34.830
Hairy balls can work.

14:34.866 --> 14:37.099
Or your grandmother naked.

14:37.134 --> 14:38.934
I've even had patients suggest to me

14:38.970 --> 14:41.237
that watching Ted Cruz on CSPAN

14:41.272 --> 14:43.806
is an effective measure for
preventing an erection.

14:47.645 --> 14:49.879
Okay, guys, here's your Snappy.

14:49.914 --> 14:51.847
- Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap.

14:51.883 --> 14:54.127
Here's... I don't know what
this is, but you guys like it,

14:54.151 --> 14:55.417
and here's your tennis racket.

14:55.453 --> 14:56.660
All right, you guys play.

14:56.762 --> 14:59.121
Daddy's got to clean this
place up, all right?

14:59.156 --> 15:01.190
Yevgeny, get that out of your mouth!

15:01.225 --> 15:03.392
What are you doing, man?
You're gonna light yourself up

15:03.427 --> 15:05.527
like a Christmas tree.
How'd you get my phone?

15:05.563 --> 15:08.597
How'd you get my phone? Come on, now.

15:08.633 --> 15:10.199
I got to move all these weights.

15:10.234 --> 15:11.901
I got to clean this place up.

15:11.936 --> 15:15.104
Okay, let me just take a
break here for just a second.

15:15.139 --> 15:17.973
You know what? I'm gonna
use you as my weights.

15:18.009 --> 15:19.419
- Don't worry, Gemma.

15:19.443 --> 15:21.310
I'll use you in my next set.

15:21.345 --> 15:23.545
- Whee!
- Whee!

15:23.581 --> 15:24.914
- Whee!

15:24.949 --> 15:26.315
Shit, you are heavy.

15:31.355 --> 15:34.657
* Happy birthday to you *

15:34.692 --> 15:37.726
* Happy birthday to you *

15:37.762 --> 15:41.397
* Happy birthday, dear Sherrie *

15:41.432 --> 15:44.300
* Happy birthday to you *

15:53.678 --> 15:55.144
Excuse me?

15:55.179 --> 15:57.446
I'm looking for Chad. Is he around?

15:57.481 --> 15:59.281
Chad!

16:07.291 --> 16:08.791
Okay.

16:08.826 --> 16:11.126
Thank you.

16:11.162 --> 16:13.462
Actually, uh, sorry to bother you.

16:13.497 --> 16:15.497
I work at Patsy's. I
wanted to let Chad know...

16:15.533 --> 16:16.765
Where?

16:16.801 --> 16:18.133
Patsy's...

16:18.169 --> 16:20.302
Pies.

16:20.338 --> 16:22.137
Oh, yeah, the dump on Franklin.

16:22.173 --> 16:23.372
You know it.

16:23.407 --> 16:25.474
Uh, I've been filling in as manager.

16:25.509 --> 16:28.043
I'd like to quit, go
back to waiting tables.

16:28.079 --> 16:31.280
That's fine. Do whatever you want.

16:31.315 --> 16:33.048
Are you allowed to say that?

16:33.084 --> 16:35.050
I mean, don't you have
to run it by Chad first?

16:35.086 --> 16:36.089
Red velvet.

16:36.210 --> 16:37.898
I know it's not your favorite, boss,

16:37.922 --> 16:40.556
but Sherrie wanted it for her birthday.

16:40.591 --> 16:42.391
Oh.

16:42.426 --> 16:44.159
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:44.195 --> 16:45.728
Zoning board is on my ass.

16:45.763 --> 16:47.830
Where is that, uh, environmental
impact study

16:47.865 --> 16:49.065
for the redevelopment project?

16:49.100 --> 16:51.033
- Which one?
- The west side.

16:51.068 --> 16:53.969
I'll call Fitz, tell
him we need it ASAP.

16:54.005 --> 16:55.571
Oh, and this one.

16:55.606 --> 16:58.374
She works at that
shithole over on Franklin.

16:58.409 --> 17:00.576
- Patsy's.
- Yeah, she wants to quit.

17:00.611 --> 17:02.411
- You do?
- Well, as manager.

17:02.446 --> 17:04.146
I want to go back to waiting tables.

17:04.181 --> 17:06.548
- We should just shut it down.
- What?

17:06.584 --> 17:09.218
Eh, it's just... it's
not worth the aggravation.

17:09.252 --> 17:11.553
- Well, you can't close it.
- Why not?

17:11.589 --> 17:13.155
I depend upon it to feed my family.

17:13.190 --> 17:14.690
You just quit.

17:14.724 --> 17:16.126
That's the problem with having a family.

17:16.127 --> 17:18.538
Well, I didn't think it
would lead to you closing it.

17:18.561 --> 17:20.329
Well, it's on its last legs, anyway.

17:20.364 --> 17:22.041
We're planning on
redeveloping that whole block.

17:22.066 --> 17:23.416
You sure?

17:23.556 --> 17:25.612
Remember what happened to
that chicken place over on LaSalle?

17:25.636 --> 17:27.513
Homeless guy started that
kitchen fire to stay warm,

17:27.538 --> 17:29.104
burnt half the building down.

17:29.140 --> 17:32.107
If I stayed on as manager,
would you keep it open?

17:32.143 --> 17:36.211
Fine. Just don't lose any money.

17:36.247 --> 17:38.414
Well, the only way to do
that is to fire people.

17:38.449 --> 17:40.616
I mean, the old manager
hired so many unreliable...

17:40.651 --> 17:41.950
Did you hear what I said?

17:41.986 --> 17:43.685
Just keep it afloat.

17:46.457 --> 17:48.690
Okay.

17:48.726 --> 17:51.360
<i>* I'm gonna run with you today *</i>

17:52.930 --> 17:54.096
<i>* I'm gonna run with you... *</i>

17:54.131 --> 17:56.432
Andale, gringos! Andale!

17:56.467 --> 17:57.966
<i>* I'm gonna run around with you *</i>

17:58.002 --> 18:00.102
<i>* Some other day *</i>

18:00.137 --> 18:02.538
<i>* I'm gonna run around with you *</i>

18:02.573 --> 18:05.607
<i>* Some today *</i>

18:05.643 --> 18:09.445
<i>* I'm gonna be with you today *</i>

18:13.417 --> 18:15.084
Whoo.

18:15.119 --> 18:16.151
Nice wheels.

18:16.187 --> 18:19.488
Ah, thanks, I jacked it...

18:19.523 --> 18:21.590
or it's one of my boss's cars.

18:21.625 --> 18:23.425
Sent me to get it detailed.

18:23.461 --> 18:24.704
Looks pretty clean already.

18:24.728 --> 18:26.046
Yeah, I was thinking

18:26.047 --> 18:27.941
about just wiping it down,
pocketing the 100 bucks.

18:27.965 --> 18:30.132
I don't have a lot of
time, so I ordered for you.

18:30.167 --> 18:31.567
Sweet, thanks.

18:31.602 --> 18:33.502
So what's up?

18:33.537 --> 18:35.237
You sounded pretty freaked.

18:35.272 --> 18:37.106
I, uh...

18:37.141 --> 18:39.575
confronted Caleb about that chick.

18:39.610 --> 18:42.444
He's screwing her.

18:42.480 --> 18:44.324
I guess there's something to
be said for honesty, right?

18:44.348 --> 18:46.582
Except he says it's not cheating.

18:46.617 --> 18:48.250
How'd he come up with that reasoning?

18:48.285 --> 18:52.454
Says if it were a
guy, then he'd be cheating.

18:52.490 --> 18:55.524
I guess that kind
of sort of makes sense.

18:55.559 --> 18:57.437
I'd rather have my girlfriend
sleeping with other chicks

18:57.461 --> 18:58.861
than some dude.

18:58.896 --> 19:00.529
- You ever fuck a guy before?
- Fuck, no.

19:00.564 --> 19:01.541
'Cause you're 100% straight, right?

19:01.565 --> 19:02.798
Absolutely.

19:02.833 --> 19:04.266
Yeah, well, Caleb's trying to argue

19:04.301 --> 19:06.016
that no one's 100% anything.

19:06.507 --> 19:10.042
It's cheater's logic.

19:10.077 --> 19:12.111
Ever think about experimenting?

19:12.146 --> 19:14.246
With a dude?

19:14.281 --> 19:16.315
No.

19:16.350 --> 19:18.117
Think it makes you less...

19:18.152 --> 19:20.252
worldly or some shit?

19:20.287 --> 19:22.654
Why?

19:22.690 --> 19:24.923
Are you thinking about experimenting
with a chick?

19:24.959 --> 19:27.659
No.

19:27.695 --> 19:29.461
I don't know, maybe.

19:32.666 --> 19:35.300
So what would you do, right?

19:35.336 --> 19:37.236
You're with this chick, bombshell chick,

19:37.271 --> 19:38.971
you're fooling around, you know?

19:39.006 --> 19:41.640
Look down, you realize a guy had joined.

19:41.675 --> 19:44.843
He's sucking your dick.

19:44.879 --> 19:46.812
How far along am I?

19:46.847 --> 19:51.817
- So you're like 93% straight.
- It's like 96% straight.

19:51.852 --> 19:53.819
All right.

20:00.728 --> 20:02.628
"Help wanted"?

20:02.663 --> 20:04.163
Yeah, I got to cover the mornings

20:04.198 --> 20:06.965
when you need to do your laundry, right?

20:08.869 --> 20:10.769
Girl, you got a target on your back.

20:10.805 --> 20:13.138
You're the bitch who told
me to stay home this morning.

20:17.845 --> 20:20.445
Let's make things a little easier
for us this time, Harry.

20:22.650 --> 20:24.817
We'll steal the stroller someone wants

20:24.852 --> 20:28.187
instead of finding someone who
wants the stroller we have.

20:30.090 --> 20:33.125
And now we wait and
see what happens, Harry.

20:45.039 --> 20:47.406
Holy shit, Harry, we
got an email already.

20:47.441 --> 20:49.608
It's for the Bugaboo stroller.

20:53.113 --> 20:54.413
Hello, Melanie?

20:54.448 --> 20:57.416
Hi, you contacted me about
the Baby Bugaboo?

20:57.451 --> 21:00.185
Yes, it's still
here... I mean available.

21:00.221 --> 21:01.520
Uh, just one sec.

21:08.796 --> 21:10.996
Hi, sorry. Um...

21:11.031 --> 21:13.198
where are you coming from?

21:13.234 --> 21:15.267
Great, I'm not too far from you.

21:15.302 --> 21:18.770
Why don't we meet at the,
uh, Trader Joe's on Ontario?

21:18.806 --> 21:21.006
Great, I'll see you there in 30 minutes.

21:35.489 --> 21:38.023
Excuse me?

21:38.058 --> 21:41.226
I saw the "help wanted"
sign at the window.

21:41.262 --> 21:42.628
Uh-huh.

21:42.663 --> 21:44.897
Can I leave my rÃ©sumÃ© with you?

21:44.932 --> 21:47.466
- Uh-huh.
- Thanks.

21:49.103 --> 21:50.302
Uh-huh.

22:01.949 --> 22:03.548
Oh, fu...

22:03.584 --> 22:05.484
Son of a bitch!

22:05.519 --> 22:07.085
Chugga-chugga, chugga-chugga,
choo.

22:08.956 --> 22:11.623
* Hully gully, hully
gully, hully gully, goo *

22:11.659 --> 22:14.326
* Hully gully, hully gully *

22:14.361 --> 22:18.563
Hey, Hully Gully, I just
cleaned that floor, man.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.667
Man, what're you laughing at?

22:21.702 --> 22:24.002
Again with my clean floor.

22:24.038 --> 22:26.438
Here we go.

22:26.473 --> 22:28.140
Oh!

22:28.175 --> 22:31.810
No, you didn't.

22:31.845 --> 22:33.912
No, you didn't!

22:33.948 --> 22:35.147
Ah, screw this.

22:35.182 --> 22:36.615
Food fight!

22:36.650 --> 22:40.085
Animal crackers, flying in!

22:40.120 --> 22:41.853
- Oh!

22:41.889 --> 22:44.356
Oh!

22:45.659 --> 22:47.592
Work looks good, gentlemen.

22:47.628 --> 22:49.328
Gracias.

22:49.363 --> 22:50.829
Fiona's gonna be mad.

22:50.864 --> 22:52.597
Mm, tough titties.

22:52.633 --> 22:56.435
Gallagher and Son would like
to thank you for your efficiency.

22:56.470 --> 23:00.138
Uno momento.

23:00.174 --> 23:03.175
This is where we lowball the illegals.

23:03.210 --> 23:06.211
They got nothing over
us after the work is done.

23:07.881 --> 23:10.716
Here we go, as promised, $50 each.

23:10.751 --> 23:13.118
You said 100.

23:13.153 --> 23:15.554
How about we make it 75,

23:15.589 --> 23:18.523
and I won't have you deported?

23:18.559 --> 23:20.959
- How about we make it 100,

23:21.028 --> 23:23.595
and we won't murder you and
the little brown boy in your sleep?

23:26.867 --> 23:28.367
You've jogged my memory.

23:28.402 --> 23:31.036
It... it was $100 each.

23:31.071 --> 23:32.537
I was in a coma.

23:32.573 --> 23:34.639
I-I was in the
hospital. I was in a coma.

23:34.675 --> 23:36.375
I get...

23:40.848 --> 23:42.047
Lucky you caught me.

23:42.082 --> 23:44.483
Was about to go home.

23:44.518 --> 23:46.685
I don't feel so lucky right now.

23:46.720 --> 23:49.821
I can barely find any
skin you haven't torn

23:49.857 --> 23:51.890
to sew back together.

23:51.925 --> 23:53.925
Jesus!

23:53.961 --> 23:55.894
I did the best I could.

23:55.929 --> 23:57.963
Put on your pants.

24:00.401 --> 24:02.401
Carefully.

24:02.436 --> 24:04.770
If it happens again, you're
gonna be in trouble.

24:04.805 --> 24:08.407
I may have no choice but to
turn that thing into a vagina.

24:08.442 --> 24:10.042
Hairy balls, son.

24:10.077 --> 24:12.077
Hairy balls.

24:15.416 --> 24:17.115
You got restaurant experience?

24:17.151 --> 24:19.551
I've been waiting tables since I was 13.

24:19.586 --> 24:22.254
- Any felony convictions?
- Nope.

24:22.289 --> 24:23.755
Are you working right now?

24:23.791 --> 24:26.725
The place I was at, Pelloni's,
closed down.

24:26.760 --> 24:30.362
Uh, it's being turned into
a Urban Outfitters.

24:30.397 --> 24:32.409
The owner here wanted to
close this place down, too,

24:32.433 --> 24:34.433
but she's giving me a
shot to turn it around.

24:34.468 --> 24:36.101
Sounds cool.

24:36.136 --> 24:38.470
That is just the kind of enthusiasm
that I'm looking for.

24:38.505 --> 24:41.039
- When can you start?
- As soon as you want me to.

24:41.075 --> 24:43.708
That's great. It's minimum
wage, plus shared tips.

24:43.744 --> 24:45.544
See you tomorrow at noon for training.

24:45.579 --> 24:47.679
Thank you so much, Miss Gallagher.

24:54.588 --> 24:56.121
- Hey, Olga?
- Yeah?

24:56.156 --> 24:57.622
You're fired.

24:57.658 --> 24:59.491
You can't fire me.

24:59.526 --> 25:02.627
I'm the only woman of
color, and I will sue your ass.

25:02.663 --> 25:05.597
Excuse me, where's the manager?

25:05.632 --> 25:07.699
Hi, I saw your "help wanted" sign.

25:10.971 --> 25:12.437
You're hired.

25:12.473 --> 25:14.406
Come back tomorrow at noon for training.

25:14.441 --> 25:15.774
Thank you.

26:07.494 --> 26:09.661
<i>Hairy balls, son.</i>

26:09.696 --> 26:11.897
<i>Hairy balls.</i>

27:12.559 --> 27:14.192
You're making me so wet.

27:14.228 --> 27:15.927
Here, feel.

27:15.963 --> 27:17.862
Yeah, it's like a rainforest,

27:17.898 --> 27:19.364
like a Slip'N Slide.

27:19.399 --> 27:21.132
Yeah.

27:21.168 --> 27:23.535
Lick my pussy.

27:23.570 --> 27:24.769
Okay.

27:27.507 --> 27:30.141
Mm-hmm.

27:33.814 --> 27:35.046
Oh, God!

27:35.082 --> 27:36.915
I could come right now!

27:38.518 --> 27:40.285
I'm not gonna. Come up here.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.920
Come up here.

27:41.955 --> 27:43.221
Oh.

27:43.257 --> 27:44.990
I want to come with you inside me.

27:45.025 --> 27:47.092
- Whenever you're ready, okay?
- Oh, okay.

27:47.127 --> 27:50.395
- I'll do that.

27:58.972 --> 28:00.283
<i>Good morning.</i>

28:00.307 --> 28:01.806
<i>Good morning.</i>

28:01.842 --> 28:04.442
<i>God bless CPAC.</i>

28:06.647 --> 28:08.513
<i>We are at the edge of a cliff.</i>

28:08.548 --> 28:12.917
- <i>Liberty is under assault.</i>

28:12.953 --> 28:14.753
Why are you watching this crap?

28:14.788 --> 28:16.421
To not get a boner.

28:16.456 --> 28:17.822
Is it working?

28:17.858 --> 28:20.258
So far.

28:20.294 --> 28:22.327
Is your penis doing okay?

28:22.362 --> 28:24.462
It's all right.

28:24.498 --> 28:26.031
<i>Each and every one of you</i>

28:26.066 --> 28:27.432
<i>is gonna be audited by the IRS.</i>

28:27.467 --> 28:30.268
All right, I'm gonna go take a shower.

28:30.304 --> 28:31.636
No, you're not.

28:31.672 --> 28:32.871
Huh?

28:32.906 --> 28:35.073
Go take a look for yourself.

28:39.813 --> 28:42.480
- Frank?
- I assume so.

28:42.516 --> 28:45.050
- The other side, too?
- Yep.

28:45.085 --> 28:46.985
<i>During the Super Bowl,</i>

28:47.020 --> 28:49.354
<i>there's not a smidgen of
corruption with the IRS...</i>

28:52.759 --> 28:54.059
- Hey, V.
- Hey.

28:54.094 --> 28:57.729
Hey, can I get a beer and a water?

28:57.764 --> 28:59.064
Thank you.

29:01.935 --> 29:04.469
Starting to remind me of him.

29:04.504 --> 29:05.804
Lip!

29:05.839 --> 29:07.672
Hey, buddy, hey.

29:07.708 --> 29:09.085
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- Going on?

29:09.109 --> 29:11.076
Don't be talking to strangers, son.

29:11.111 --> 29:13.011
Frank, Liam can't be in here.

29:13.046 --> 29:14.646
Drinking age in my country is four...

29:14.681 --> 29:16.047
and a half.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.694
That half really makes a difference.

29:17.718 --> 29:19.384
Fine, he can stay.

29:19.419 --> 29:22.087
But no booze, and we
charge the same for sodas

29:22.122 --> 29:23.355
Ah, extra...

29:23.390 --> 29:25.490
- For sodas.
- Oh.

29:25.525 --> 29:28.059
Don't be corrupting my
son with your interracial,

29:28.095 --> 29:29.994
bisexual funny business.

29:30.030 --> 29:31.207
What do you want, Frank?

29:31.231 --> 29:32.764
Two Cokes.

29:32.799 --> 29:34.744
Never thought I'd hear
that come out of your mouth.

29:34.768 --> 29:36.935
Well, being a good role
model for my progeny

29:36.970 --> 29:38.837
is an important job, Kermit,

29:38.872 --> 29:41.873
unlike the bad influences
he's had up to this point.

29:41.908 --> 29:44.075
Hey, buddy, hi. You doing okay?

29:44.111 --> 29:46.845
- I'm having fun with Frank.
- Well, of course you are.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.758
Well, if you need anything,
you know how to call, yeah?

29:48.782 --> 29:50.115
Mm-hmm.

29:50.150 --> 29:51.549
All right.

29:59.259 --> 30:03.061
Hey, want to have some real fun tonight?

30:03.096 --> 30:04.863
What do you say you and me

30:04.898 --> 30:08.266
get some female company for tonight?

30:08.301 --> 30:10.368
You can have your pick of the litter.

30:10.404 --> 30:14.639
Now, the important
criteria to look for is who's DTF,

30:14.674 --> 30:17.442
who's holding weed or coke,

30:17.477 --> 30:21.079
and who makes your wee-wee tingle.

30:21.114 --> 30:22.914
Now go get the one you want.

30:33.827 --> 30:36.161
Oh, it's a tiny dude!

30:36.196 --> 30:38.263
- Whoa!

30:38.298 --> 30:41.433
I've got a date.

30:41.468 --> 30:43.668
- A lovely choice.

30:43.703 --> 30:45.637
- Hello.
- Hello.

30:45.672 --> 30:47.672
Care to join us, Dollface?

30:47.707 --> 30:49.240
Sure.

30:49.276 --> 30:51.309
<i>Dude, it's really not that bad.</i>

30:51.344 --> 30:52.510
How do you deal with it...

30:52.546 --> 30:54.813
The taste and the folds

30:54.848 --> 30:56.247
and the slime?

30:56.283 --> 30:57.849
What, uh, cheese dick and a throat

30:57.884 --> 30:59.117
full of spooge, that's better?

30:59.152 --> 31:01.519
Give me a beer.

31:03.223 --> 31:05.089
God!

31:05.125 --> 31:07.158
Man, if I sucked some guy's dick,

31:07.194 --> 31:09.205
I wouldn't be half as
dramatic as you're being right now.

31:09.229 --> 31:10.995
You're a better man than I.

31:11.031 --> 31:12.363
You at least feel more worldly?

31:12.399 --> 31:14.132
Not at all.

31:14.167 --> 31:16.301
I think it had steam coming off of it.

31:16.336 --> 31:18.136
Should I just get you the Drano, then?

31:18.171 --> 31:20.171
If I knew I could gargle
it, dude, without dying,

31:20.207 --> 31:21.206
I'd say yes.

31:21.241 --> 31:23.775
You are 100% gay.

31:23.810 --> 31:25.443
I have PTSD.

31:28.915 --> 31:32.116
It's all over my boobs, too.

31:32.152 --> 31:33.952
What the hell happened here?

31:33.987 --> 31:35.320
Did we get robbed?

31:35.355 --> 31:36.321
- Kev.
- Wake up.

31:36.356 --> 31:37.622
Hey.

31:37.657 --> 31:39.023
Oh.

31:39.059 --> 31:41.025
Hey, sexy. Hey, beautiful.

31:41.061 --> 31:43.528
- What is going on?
- This place is a disaster.

31:43.563 --> 31:44.963
You were supposed to clean today.

31:44.998 --> 31:46.831
Oh, sorry, I know.

31:46.867 --> 31:49.534
I got too busy, but we had a great day.

31:49.569 --> 31:51.035
Oh, my... Did you know Gemma

31:51.071 --> 31:52.804
can climb up on the
couch all by herself?

31:52.839 --> 31:54.506
Your only job was to clean today.

31:54.541 --> 31:58.076
Really? I thought I was
supposed to keep the kids alive, too.

31:58.111 --> 32:00.245
We were at work all
day, busting our butts.

32:00.280 --> 32:02.580
Yeah, all we ask is to come
home to a clean house.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.215
I was working all day, too.

32:04.251 --> 32:05.683
Doing what, having a food fight?

32:05.719 --> 32:07.552
- Did you even shower?
- Make us dinner?

32:07.587 --> 32:10.221
Oh, my God, I'm not a maid. Why
are you two riding my ass?

32:10.257 --> 32:13.758
Because you sat on that
ass all day doing nothing.

32:13.793 --> 32:15.860
Oh, that's exactly what I did today.

32:15.896 --> 32:17.729
Nothing.

32:17.764 --> 32:21.966
I did a heaping shit
pile of absolutely nothing!

32:25.972 --> 32:29.040
- Uh, $328...
- Are you kidding...

32:29.075 --> 32:30.453
- No, wait, no, no!

32:30.477 --> 32:31.876
Come on, not the front door.

32:31.912 --> 32:33.444
We have a special entrance.

32:34.748 --> 32:36.748
Whoa!

32:36.783 --> 32:38.116
Got a plan?

32:38.151 --> 32:40.184
Yeah, of course there's a plan.

32:40.220 --> 32:41.419
Oh, shit.

32:41.454 --> 32:43.855
- Let's just...
- Okay.

32:43.890 --> 32:46.057
<i>* It's quite all right *</i>

32:46.092 --> 32:48.192
<i>* I feel like... *</i>

32:48.228 --> 32:50.128
- Ladies first.
- Okay. Oh, boy.

32:50.163 --> 32:51.930
- I'll give you a boost.
- Okay.

32:51.965 --> 32:54.232
- Liam, come on.
- Okay.

32:54.301 --> 32:56.601
- Don't fall, okay?
- Okay.

32:56.636 --> 32:58.536
Are you sure this thing is safe?

32:58.572 --> 33:00.705
- Well, we'll find out soon.
- Okay.

33:00.740 --> 33:02.140
Liam, grab my ankles.

33:02.175 --> 33:04.108
<i>* All right, all right, all right *</i>

33:04.144 --> 33:05.643
<i>* Hello, hello... *</i>

33:05.679 --> 33:07.312
Okay. Oh, yeah. Thank you.

33:08.682 --> 33:09.747
Jesus.

33:09.783 --> 33:10.949
<i>* Hello... *</i>

33:10.984 --> 33:12.083
Whoa.

33:12.118 --> 33:14.285
Frank, I'm sorry.

33:26.466 --> 33:29.000
Holy shit.

33:29.035 --> 33:30.902
I had no idea our floor was so slanted.

33:30.937 --> 33:32.937
Ugh, it'd be nice to have a toothbrush

33:32.973 --> 33:34.505
and a change of clothes.

33:34.541 --> 33:36.174
Yeah, I need a shower.

33:36.209 --> 33:38.943
My ass is numb from this chair.

33:38.979 --> 33:41.312
This couch is pretty comfy.

33:41.348 --> 33:43.314
Still not mad at Frank, huh?

33:43.350 --> 33:46.351
I refuse to let him
have any of my energy.

33:48.455 --> 33:50.521
- Dibs on the kitchen bathroom!
- Oh!

33:50.557 --> 33:52.423
Oh, shit, you...

33:54.027 --> 33:56.861
- Shit!

33:56.896 --> 33:58.162
We got to get upstairs.

33:58.198 --> 33:59.931
Yeah, we can throw a stink bomb up there

33:59.966 --> 34:00.999
if Liam weren't with him.

34:01.034 --> 34:02.667
Put bars up on the window.

34:02.702 --> 34:04.469
<i>Do you guys
think we can set fire</i>

34:04.504 --> 34:06.537
<i>to the top floor of the house?</i>

34:06.573 --> 34:09.574
- Hurry up in there!
- I'm using the sink.

34:15.915 --> 34:18.416
Holy shit.

34:18.451 --> 34:20.385
Dude, that is a mangled mess.

34:20.420 --> 34:21.886
- Oh, my God.
- Ugh, fuck.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.855
It's all bloody and raw, man.

34:23.889 --> 34:26.002
You shouldn't have gotten that
stupid circumcision, man.

34:26.025 --> 34:27.402
All right, well, I
did, and there's nothing

34:27.427 --> 34:29.960
I can do about it now, so fuck you guys.

34:29.996 --> 34:32.308
I already feel like enough of
a freak being the only Gallagher

34:32.331 --> 34:33.998
who's not circumcised.

34:34.034 --> 34:37.034
Thanks for making
me feel worse about it.

34:41.206 --> 34:43.074
What the hell?

34:52.284 --> 34:53.518
Hey, kids.

34:53.553 --> 34:55.219
See those ladies over there?

34:55.255 --> 34:56.920
They're gonna help us clean the house

34:56.956 --> 34:58.990
so we can spend more
time playing together.

35:01.594 --> 35:02.927
Eh, what the hell?

35:02.962 --> 35:04.529
<i>* All at once all the time *</i>

35:04.564 --> 35:05.830
<i>* The nitty-gritty get *</i>

35:05.865 --> 35:06.865
<i>* The sweetest taste... *</i>

35:06.900 --> 35:08.433
Yeah.

35:10.303 --> 35:12.236
Main's off, and
the outside spigot's open.

35:12.272 --> 35:14.072
All right, hand me the hacksaw.

35:14.107 --> 35:15.173
Thanks.

35:17.110 --> 35:19.711
Let's see how long he
lasts up there without water.

35:25.819 --> 35:27.285
This is so fun, Harry.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.954
We have such a great life now.

35:29.989 --> 35:32.924
Double stroller?

35:32.959 --> 35:35.460
We could get a lot for that.

35:40.530 --> 35:42.163
<i>* I've seen the good gone bad *</i>

35:42.199 --> 35:43.832
<i>* I've seen the right go wrong *</i>

35:43.867 --> 35:45.567
<i>* From the middle of the city *</i>

35:45.602 --> 35:47.702
<i>* To the back of beyond... *</i>

35:47.738 --> 35:49.916
Pretty soon we'll be able to
start saving up for college.

35:49.940 --> 35:51.806
- Oh, no, it's okay.

35:51.842 --> 35:54.153
You don't have to go to
college if you don't want to, Harry.

35:59.516 --> 36:00.815
Shit!

36:03.754 --> 36:05.520
<i>* If you wanna sing *</i>

36:05.555 --> 36:07.188
<i>* Well, I got a song *</i>

36:07.224 --> 36:08.656
<i>* From the middle of the city *</i>

36:08.692 --> 36:09.891
<i>* To the back of beyond *</i>

36:09.926 --> 36:12.160
<i>* I say yeah *</i>

36:25.709 --> 36:28.943
That smell could knock a
buzzard off a gut wagon.

36:30.547 --> 36:35.050
Hey, Dollface, we got to hose you down.

36:35.085 --> 36:38.620
You're riper than a fat
boy in a clown costume.

36:38.655 --> 36:40.455
- Hey!
- I'm sorry.

36:41.491 --> 36:42.791
Liam...

36:42.826 --> 36:44.659
coffee on the hot plate.

36:56.973 --> 36:59.974
Oh, God damn it. I...

37:06.016 --> 37:08.483
I hope it was recently flushed.

37:12.856 --> 37:14.689
Two raptors circling the nest.

37:30.474 --> 37:31.940
Nest is secured.

37:59.336 --> 38:00.768
What's in the box?

38:00.804 --> 38:04.038
New uniforms.

38:04.074 --> 38:06.941
- Oh, those are so cute!
- Oh, hell, no.

38:06.977 --> 38:09.210
- I am not exposing my legs.
- Oh, come on.

38:09.246 --> 38:10.545
You'll make more tips.

38:10.580 --> 38:12.981
Nobody sees my spider
veins except my gyno

38:13.016 --> 38:14.649
and the neighbor with the binoculars.

38:14.684 --> 38:17.185
Don't have to work here anymore.

38:17.220 --> 38:19.187
Fine.

38:19.222 --> 38:21.456
Bunch of us are going to
Melody Lounge after work.

38:21.491 --> 38:22.957
- You should come.
- Is that a club?

38:22.993 --> 38:24.192
It'll be fun.

38:24.227 --> 38:25.827
I don't have a change of clothes.

38:25.862 --> 38:28.029
- Of course you do.
- Yeah, right.

38:28.064 --> 38:30.198
Come on, you look fine.

38:30.233 --> 38:32.100
Hey, bring Lip, too.

38:47.184 --> 38:50.485
You know, the Feds showed
up at my internship today.

38:50.520 --> 38:53.054
Yeah, took a couple of servers.

38:53.089 --> 38:54.322
What for?

38:54.357 --> 38:56.090
No idea.

38:56.126 --> 38:58.226
But those nerds are richer than balls.

39:01.131 --> 39:02.864
I texted Caleb.

39:02.899 --> 39:05.533
Told him to meet me at
the loft after work.

39:05.569 --> 39:07.068
Gonna compare vagina stories?

39:07.137 --> 39:09.103
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

39:09.139 --> 39:10.572
There's Carl.

39:13.910 --> 39:17.912
<i>Carl Gallagher, please
approach the ambulance.</i>

39:17.948 --> 39:20.181
<i>Gonna need you to speed up, Carl.</i>

39:25.322 --> 39:27.121
I'm coming!

39:27.157 --> 39:28.623
- Shh!

39:28.658 --> 39:30.758
Gonna wake up the damn babies.

39:33.964 --> 39:36.097
You must be from the
topless-maid company.

39:36.132 --> 39:37.432
You're quick.

39:37.467 --> 39:39.634
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

39:39.669 --> 39:41.402
Yes.

39:41.438 --> 39:43.104
Let me show you around.

39:43.139 --> 39:45.807
As you can see, the place is a mess.

39:45.842 --> 39:47.809
I'm gonna need you to do the laundry,

39:47.844 --> 39:49.577
wash the dishes,

39:49.613 --> 39:52.080
clean the floors,
vacuum, and dust the furniture.

39:52.115 --> 39:53.815
Sound good? Okay!

39:53.850 --> 39:55.550
Wow. Sorry.

39:55.585 --> 39:57.151
This is happening.

39:58.922 --> 40:00.488
Those are spectacular.

40:00.523 --> 40:02.068
It's amazing how you
stuffed them in there

40:02.092 --> 40:03.569
and now they're out in all their glory.

40:03.593 --> 40:06.127
Hallelujah.

40:07.197 --> 40:08.963
What's happening to me?

40:08.999 --> 40:11.399
We gave you a jumbo dose of Thorazine.

40:11.434 --> 40:13.735
My brain feels like cotton candy.

40:13.770 --> 40:16.404
And that's the way you're
gonna feel for the next 72 hours.

40:16.439 --> 40:19.107
No way you get a boner on that shit.

40:19.142 --> 40:21.609
Don't have to think about
hairy balls anymore.

40:21.645 --> 40:23.177
What?

40:24.648 --> 40:27.582
You guys are the best.

40:35.325 --> 40:36.991
Wendy, don't get me wrong.

40:37.027 --> 40:38.793
I like what's going on here,

40:38.828 --> 40:40.862
but are you gonna be
doing any cleaning today?

40:40.897 --> 40:42.530
Cleaning?

40:42.565 --> 40:44.432
You didn't bring any Lysol

40:44.467 --> 40:47.368
or... or ammonia or a mop or anything.

40:47.404 --> 40:52.140
You thought a topless maid service
actually did cleaning?

40:52.175 --> 40:54.142
Yes.

40:54.177 --> 40:55.777
That's cute.

40:55.812 --> 40:57.312
Here.

40:57.347 --> 41:00.315
My services are Ã  la
carte. Pick what you like.

41:00.350 --> 41:02.884
- Mop and glow.
- That's one of my specialties.

41:02.919 --> 41:04.619
I'm sure it is.

41:04.654 --> 41:06.854
- Pipe cleaning.
- Old dudes like that one.

41:07.924 --> 41:09.524
Brazilian floor wax.

41:09.559 --> 41:11.025
That's not what you think it is.

41:11.061 --> 41:15.830
I have no idea what I think that is.

41:15.865 --> 41:18.433
Sham wow?

41:21.438 --> 41:23.838
Hey, you finally
decided to come home.

41:23.873 --> 41:26.474
Did you trick me into
having sex with a woman?

41:26.509 --> 41:28.009
What?

41:28.044 --> 41:30.244
So that you wouldn't feel
bad about what you did?

41:30.280 --> 41:31.913
Look, what are you talking about?

41:31.948 --> 41:34.382
You made me feel like a
freak 'cause I'm only gay.

41:34.417 --> 41:36.317
How you feel is on you.

41:36.353 --> 41:39.887
I slept with some random
chick 'cause of you.

41:39.923 --> 41:41.589
I didn't force you to do anything.

41:41.624 --> 41:43.725
I can still taste her
hairspray and her pubes

41:43.760 --> 41:45.526
and her vagisitis.

41:45.562 --> 41:47.528
You obviously picked the wrong woman.

41:47.564 --> 41:48.830
Don't turn this around on me.

41:48.865 --> 41:50.531
You're the weirdo, all right? Not me.

41:50.567 --> 41:52.700
Because I like to have sex
with women once in a while?

41:52.736 --> 41:54.502
- It's not normal.
- It's very normal.

41:54.537 --> 41:56.904
Not if you're gay, it's
not. It's disgusting.

41:56.940 --> 41:59.173
Then don't do it anymore.

41:59.209 --> 42:01.509
And it's a turnoff.

42:01.544 --> 42:03.611
Me? I'm the turnoff?

42:03.646 --> 42:05.179
You sleep with women...

42:05.215 --> 42:06.414
yeah.

42:06.449 --> 42:08.216
Then why are we even going out?

42:11.488 --> 42:13.388
I keep asking myself the same thing.

42:13.423 --> 42:15.123
- Judgmental much?
- Vagina-fucker much?

42:15.158 --> 42:16.958
When did you become such a baby?

42:16.993 --> 42:19.093
When did you become such a bisexual?

42:22.432 --> 42:23.765
So that's it, then.

42:29.739 --> 42:31.606
Yeah, I guess so.

42:33.843 --> 42:36.778
- Have a nice life.
- Already am.

42:41.451 --> 42:43.751
Kevin, what are you doing?

42:43.787 --> 42:46.254
I got a great idea for a business.

42:46.289 --> 42:48.222
- Where are babies?
- Sleeping.

42:48.258 --> 42:49.824
- Monitor.
- Is the house clean?

42:49.859 --> 42:52.093
That is a great question,
which is directly related

42:52.128 --> 42:53.327
to my new business plan.

42:53.363 --> 42:55.563
- So, no?
- You are correct.

42:55.598 --> 42:58.633
The topless maid that I
hired was more of an escort...

42:58.668 --> 43:01.238
- You hired a topless maid?
- Did you have sex with her?

43:01.239 --> 43:02.136
Of course not.

43:02.172 --> 43:04.316
What else did you think a
topless-maid service did, Kev?

43:04.340 --> 43:06.407
I was focused on the maid part

43:06.443 --> 43:08.976
and not the topless
part, which gave me this idea.

43:12.048 --> 43:14.449
- Nooks and Fannies?
- Yes.

43:14.484 --> 43:16.284
We are gonna start a maid service

43:16.319 --> 43:18.419
that is not only topless

43:18.455 --> 43:20.521
but also cleans; we'll
corner the market.

43:20.557 --> 43:22.623
You expect me to
clean someone else's house?

43:22.659 --> 43:24.292
Don't have to. That's the genius part.

43:24.327 --> 43:26.794
You two are the boobs of the operation.

43:26.830 --> 43:28.296
She's gonna do the cleaning.

43:40.376 --> 43:42.176
I think these girls just invited me

43:42.212 --> 43:43.544
so I'd bring you.

43:45.882 --> 43:47.515
Hey!

43:47.550 --> 43:48.983
Oh. He's... he's cute.

43:49.018 --> 43:50.818
Wait, wait, wait. Stop,
stop, stop, stop.

43:50.854 --> 43:52.453
- Hi, Lip.
- Hey, hi.

43:52.489 --> 43:54.021
Hi.

43:54.057 --> 43:55.389
What are you drinking?

43:55.425 --> 43:56.791
Uh, beer.

43:56.826 --> 43:58.459
Okay. You want something, girl?

43:58.495 --> 44:01.629
Uh, a change of
clothes. You guys look great.

44:01.664 --> 44:04.165
Have a shot. It'll make you feel sexier.

44:04.200 --> 44:08.469
Uh, two Stellas and three
shots of Jager, on my tab.

44:08.505 --> 44:11.339
I saw you checking me
out during my interview.

44:11.374 --> 44:12.740
That obvious?

44:12.775 --> 44:14.075
But I liked it.

44:15.111 --> 44:18.212
- Oh.
- Thanks.

44:18.248 --> 44:19.514
Cheers, boss.

44:19.549 --> 44:20.882
Thanks.

44:20.917 --> 44:22.350
Cheers.

44:25.421 --> 44:26.654
Ugh!

44:26.689 --> 44:28.055
- Let's dance.
- Yeah.

44:34.631 --> 44:36.063
Just so you know...

44:36.099 --> 44:38.065
I have a kid and a stupid ex-boyfriend,

44:38.101 --> 44:39.867
so I'm not looking for anything serious.

44:39.903 --> 44:42.436
Yeah, well, uh, I just
got expelled from college

44:42.472 --> 44:45.072
and did 30 days in rehab, so...

44:45.108 --> 44:47.074
Then we're a perfect match.

44:52.115 --> 44:53.481
- Hey.
- Yeah.

44:56.553 --> 44:58.219
Is that Ariel's boyfriend?

44:58.254 --> 45:00.588
No. She just met him on Tinder.

45:00.623 --> 45:02.390
Going to the bathroom to bang.

45:02.425 --> 45:03.691
- You on Tinder?

45:03.726 --> 45:05.092
- Uh-uh.
- Mm.

45:05.128 --> 45:07.261
Not into the meaningless, random hookup?

45:07.297 --> 45:09.096
Uh, no, I'm more of a

45:09.132 --> 45:12.099
"one dysfunctional
relationship into another" kind of girl.

45:12.135 --> 45:14.268
- I'm taking a break.
- This is why you need Tinder.

45:14.304 --> 45:16.103
Give me your phone.

45:17.740 --> 45:19.106
You're a hot piece of ass.

45:19.142 --> 45:21.108
You should be boning on the regs.

45:21.144 --> 45:23.244
- Let's get you a picture.
- I don't know.

45:25.481 --> 45:27.315
They always seem to get attached.

45:27.350 --> 45:29.216
Or maybe that's me.

45:29.252 --> 45:30.818
You bragging about your golden vagina?

45:30.853 --> 45:34.221
No, more like my golden
ability to pick liars.

45:34.257 --> 45:37.725
Then don't talk to
them. Just swipe, fuck, leave.

45:37.760 --> 45:38.993
Ooh.

45:39.028 --> 45:40.428
You already have three matches.

45:40.463 --> 45:42.496
And Luke is at the
bar across the street,

45:42.532 --> 45:43.965
ready to rumble.

45:45.134 --> 45:46.300
Mm-hmm.

45:46.336 --> 45:48.002
Oh.

45:59.782 --> 46:01.349
What the fuck?

46:01.384 --> 46:03.150
Everybody, wake up.

46:03.186 --> 46:04.685
- What's going on?
- That!

46:04.721 --> 46:06.687
No! Oh. Oh!

46:06.723 --> 46:09.256
Oh, shit! Fuck.

46:09.292 --> 46:12.326
Don't say Papa never gave you a pet.

46:13.997 --> 46:16.697
- Hey.

46:16.733 --> 46:18.532
Ugh!

46:19.836 --> 46:21.969
V!

46:22.005 --> 46:25.773
V! Where are you?

46:25.808 --> 46:27.508
- Ah, V!

46:27.543 --> 46:29.844
- Hi.
- What the hell are you doing?

46:29.879 --> 46:31.979
- Can V come out and play?
- It's 2 a.m.

46:32.015 --> 46:33.981
My kids, my husband and
wife are sleeping.

46:36.019 --> 46:38.152
You know that that sounds weird, right?

46:38.187 --> 46:39.186
You're drunk.

46:39.222 --> 46:40.454
And fucked.

46:40.490 --> 46:42.990
I just Tinder-fucked... this guy.

46:43.026 --> 46:46.794
His name is, like, a J or
an L or some other letter.

46:46.829 --> 46:48.162
I don't care.

46:48.197 --> 46:50.131
Careless, mindless sex has set me free.

46:50.166 --> 46:51.377
Tell me more about it tomorrow.

46:51.401 --> 46:54.201
This guy was doing this...

46:54.237 --> 46:56.237
What the fuck?

46:58.041 --> 47:00.608
Did you just close the door in my face?

47:10.420 --> 47:12.586
- I found a pickax.
- What the hell you doing?

47:12.622 --> 47:14.555
- Looking for demolition tools.
- Fiona?

47:14.590 --> 47:17.358
- There's a shovel in here.
- She's asleep.

47:18.628 --> 47:21.829
It's me!

47:21.864 --> 47:25.399
Hey, I brought you some coffee.
I figured you might be hungover.

47:25.435 --> 47:28.035
I am. What time is it?

47:28.071 --> 47:31.605
Not as early as you
ringing my doorbell last night.

47:31.641 --> 47:33.507
- Huh?
- Don't "huh" me.

47:35.445 --> 47:37.478
- Yo, Fi.
- Huh?

47:37.513 --> 47:39.346
Pickax, sledgehammer.

47:39.382 --> 47:41.382
Sledgehammer.

47:43.086 --> 47:44.285
I'll see you upstairs.

47:44.320 --> 47:47.254
I'll be up in a minute.

47:47.290 --> 47:48.689
We're getting rid of Frank.

47:51.461 --> 47:53.461
Ow.

47:53.496 --> 47:55.863
Who was this random guy you
hooked up with last night?

47:55.898 --> 47:58.432
Key word in that sentence is "random."

47:58.468 --> 48:00.267
I don't know.

48:00.303 --> 48:03.037
Why you sleeping with
random dudes, anyway?

48:03.072 --> 48:05.706
Why am I not hooking
up with random dudes?

48:05.742 --> 48:08.075
Some sort of rebound thing from Sean?

48:09.679 --> 48:13.314
I'd have to care for it to
be a Sean-rebound thing.

48:13.349 --> 48:15.583
Funny. You said the
same thing about Frank.

48:15.618 --> 48:18.652
Ooh. Having a rebound thing with Frank?

48:18.688 --> 48:20.955
No, dummy. Caring.

48:20.990 --> 48:24.658
You seriously think that I
give a fuck about Sean or Frank?

48:24.694 --> 48:27.294
It's been weeks, and
you haven't talked at all

48:27.330 --> 48:29.163
about what happened on your wedding day.

48:29.198 --> 48:32.466
'Cause there's nothing to talk about...

48:32.502 --> 48:34.902
so I'm not gonna talk about it...

48:34.937 --> 48:37.171
ever.

48:37.206 --> 48:39.106
<i>* Hey, hey, there's a fire *</i>

48:39.142 --> 48:41.342
<i>* And it's running, coming in here *</i>

48:42.945 --> 48:44.211
<i>* Hey *</i>

48:44.247 --> 48:45.946
<i>* Hey, hey, there's a fire *</i>

48:45.982 --> 48:47.815
<i>* And it's running, coming in here *</i>

48:47.850 --> 48:49.650
Look, it's harder than I thought.

48:49.685 --> 48:51.986
<i>- * Hey *
- * Hey, hey, now *</i>

48:52.021 --> 48:53.654
<i>* Hey, hey, now *</i>

48:53.689 --> 48:55.322
<i>* Hey, hey, now *</i>

48:55.358 --> 48:56.924
<i>* Hey, hey, now *</i>

48:56.959 --> 48:58.159
<i>* Hey, hey, now *</i>

48:59.295 --> 49:01.328
<i>* Hey, hey, now *</i>

49:09.172 --> 49:11.172
- What the fuck?

49:11.207 --> 49:12.273
<i>* Hey, hey, now *</i>

49:13.976 --> 49:16.343
<i>* Hey, hey, hey *</i>

49:16.379 --> 49:18.045
<i>* Hey, hey, now *</i>

49:18.080 --> 49:20.614
<i>* Things are burning up *</i>

49:20.650 --> 49:21.615
Aah!

49:25.655 --> 49:30.291
Five, four, three, two, one.

49:33.162 --> 49:35.963
Okay, well, the 72 hours is up.
