01:54.656 --> 01:57.033
<i>a nose job,</i>
<i>the V-shape face contouring surgery.</i>

01:57.117 --> 02:00.411
HER FACE IS OBVIOUSLY WORKED ON,
BUT SHE IS SATISFIED.

02:00.495 --> 02:01.830
<i>70 out of 100.</i>

02:16.010 --> 02:18.763
85 OUT OF 100

02:20.140 --> 02:22.142
THE BEAUTIFUL FACE YOU DREAM OF!

02:23.059 --> 02:25.061
ALL PRETTY GIRLS KNOW!

02:25.687 --> 02:28.439
<i>I'd be happy even with an average face.</i>

02:28.731 --> 02:29.816
65 OUT OF 100

02:30.150 --> 02:33.236
<i>72 out of 100.</i>
<i>Will I be able to get there?</i>

02:36.447 --> 02:38.992
I'll go over
what you and the doctor discussed.

02:39.075 --> 02:42.328
Double eyelid surgery through incision
and all-round canthoplasty.

02:42.412 --> 02:45.123
Also a nose job, a noble surgery,
full face contouring

02:45.206 --> 02:47.834
and fat injections
all over the face. Is that correct?

<i>83 out of 100.</i>

03:04.392 --> 03:05.226
SURGERY AGREEMENT

03:05.310 --> 03:08.062
Noticeable puffiness and bruises will last
for about a month.

03:08.688 --> 03:12.609
Post-procedural complications may result
in bleeding or infections.

03:12.692 --> 03:16.446
Such cases are rare, but if necessary,
she can receive a blood transfusion.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.824
Well, that doesn't happen often, does it?

03:20.241 --> 03:21.951
No, not often.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.370
-It's rare, but it can happen.
-I see.

03:24.454 --> 03:26.706
It usually doesn't happen.
Please don't worry.

03:26.789 --> 03:29.000
-The surgery will go well.
-I see.

SURGERY CENTER

03:56.569 --> 03:59.155
It'll be a whole new world
when you wake up.

03:59.906 --> 04:00.823
Yes.

04:04.744 --> 04:08.039
So this is the last time
I can see this face of yours.

04:11.584 --> 04:12.585
Mom...

04:12.794 --> 04:16.172
Oh dear, don't cry.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.261
-You know that I love you, right?
-Yes.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.805
-I love you very much.
-I know.

04:24.472 --> 04:25.890
Please come in.

04:27.558 --> 04:28.685
Go on in.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.650
You can't cry during the surgery.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.652
You got this, Mi-rae!

05:12.061 --> 05:13.521
You'll start feeling sleepy.

05:36.252 --> 05:38.254
-Hey, Fatty!
-Hey, Fatty!

05:39.797 --> 05:42.091
-You pig!
-You pig!

05:49.432 --> 05:52.268
-Mi-rae is a pig!
-Mi-rae is a pig!

06:30.515 --> 06:34.018
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT?

06:39.607 --> 06:41.109
THE PIG

06:59.419 --> 07:01.504
What are you looking at?
The pig.

07:01.838 --> 07:02.880
Oink-oink.

07:04.215 --> 07:06.050
That was seriously so funny.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.845
She really looked like a pig earlier.

07:18.312 --> 07:20.314
-No, wait!
-Stop it!

07:20.398 --> 07:21.566
-Stop!
-Don't do this!

07:21.649 --> 07:23.526
-Come on!
-It hurts!

07:23.776 --> 07:25.778
-Let go of this.
-Get off me.

07:26.612 --> 07:30.491
<i>I was a brave girl and I didn't stay quiet</i>
<i>when the other kids made fun of me.</i>

07:31.701 --> 07:34.120
<i>-But every time I fought back...</i>
-Open the door!

07:34.495 --> 07:37.665
<i>-...they'd always do something worse.</i>
-Hurry up and open the door!

07:37.748 --> 07:39.667
-Open it!
-You're strong.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.961
Just break the door open.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.423
Open the door!

07:45.673 --> 07:47.592
Open it!

07:47.717 --> 07:49.719
I said, open the door!

07:58.060 --> 08:02.857
<i>Winning the fight isn't what victims want.</i>

08:05.693 --> 08:08.154
<i>All they want is to stop being the victim.</i>

08:10.448 --> 08:12.533
<i>They just don't want to be victimized.</i>

08:32.511 --> 08:35.597
I'm not going to eat.
I said, I'm not going to eat!

08:38.100 --> 08:41.187
But I took out all the bones for you.

08:42.020 --> 08:44.732
You can't leave with an empty stomach.

08:44.982 --> 08:49.278
<i>Up until then, I thought I still had</i>
<i>a chance to become pretty.</i>

08:49.695 --> 08:52.281
<i>Because I heard the best makeover is</i>
<i>to lose weight.</i>

08:52.365 --> 08:54.367
You'll only end up gaining weight again!

09:03.709 --> 09:05.378
<i>But I didn't gain my weight back,</i>

09:06.087 --> 09:08.089
<i>because I was very determined.</i>

09:12.134 --> 09:15.263
Someone in our class got the highest score
in the entire grade.

09:15.346 --> 09:16.806
Mi-rae, congratulations.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.564
<i>No one made fun of me for a while,</i>

09:25.523 --> 09:28.109
<i>so I thought</i>
<i>I had finally become a normal student.</i>

09:45.751 --> 09:47.378
What is it that you need to say?

09:49.171 --> 09:51.882
Here. I made a list
of expected questions on the exam.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.676
I'm only giving this to you.

09:55.219 --> 09:56.053
Why?

09:57.013 --> 09:57.847
Because...

09:58.806 --> 10:00.808
I like you.

10:00.891 --> 10:01.934
What?

10:02.602 --> 10:03.477
Are you crazy?

10:05.396 --> 10:06.564
Why...

10:07.857 --> 10:08.816
What do you mean?

10:16.699 --> 10:17.700
Hey, Kang Orc.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.331
I'm talking to you, Kang Orc.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.876
Don't you know your nickname?

10:27.335 --> 10:28.502
You were joking, right?

10:28.586 --> 10:30.087
Tell me you were joking.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.590
-Yong-cheol.
-Hey, Kang Orc.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.217
I'll kill you if you tell anybody
that you like me.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.345
You better keep it a secret.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.396
<i>I never</i>

10:49.190 --> 10:51.567
<i>ended up becoming pretty.</i>

11:05.164 --> 11:07.917
Why don't you just do her a favor
and go out with her?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.919
You go out with her, you jerk.

11:10.002 --> 11:11.629
-What are you saying?
-Kang Orc.

11:11.712 --> 11:13.673
Yong-Cheol changed his mind.

11:13.756 --> 11:14.757
What are you saying?

11:24.100 --> 11:28.104
Okay, let's take a photo.
In 1, 2, 3.

11:29.438 --> 11:32.066
-Okay, that was great.
-Nice.

11:32.400 --> 11:35.486
Okay, it's time for Group Three.
Get over here and pose.

11:35.569 --> 11:38.656
Hey, hurry up. Okay, nice.

11:39.156 --> 11:41.325
Now, everybody, pose.

11:41.409 --> 11:44.412
Okay, nice.
Let's do this in one go. In 1, 2, 3.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.331
Okay. No, wait.

11:47.665 --> 11:51.377
Hey, you over there.
You need to show your face.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.338
-My gosh.
-What's wrong with her?

11:54.422 --> 11:57.007
She's embarrassed because she's ugly.

11:57.299 --> 11:59.009
Gosh, it's hot. So annoying.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.761
Okay, let's take one more photo.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.847
Everybody, smile. Let me see your teeth.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.933
Okay, let's go. In 1, 2, 3.

12:08.227 --> 12:09.562
<i>I never got...</i>

12:11.522 --> 12:13.357
<i>to lead a normal life.</i>

12:39.049 --> 12:41.218
<i>I can't even love anyone</i>
<i>like everyone else,</i>

12:44.013 --> 12:45.139
<i>because...</i>

12:49.268 --> 12:50.561
<i>I'm an orc.</i>

13:40.861 --> 13:42.822
This place really must be famous.

13:43.906 --> 13:45.157
Look at all these people.

13:56.126 --> 13:57.711
Don't worry about anything else

13:57.795 --> 14:01.423
and just focus on resting here
before you start school. Okay?

14:04.718 --> 14:09.849
Mi-rae, just focus on taking in
all the good energy from this mountain

14:09.932 --> 14:11.392
and becoming pretty.

14:19.441 --> 14:22.278
Let's take in all the good energy
from this mountain

14:22.778 --> 14:26.991
so that Mi-rae can become pretty!

14:27.616 --> 14:31.495
<i>Just as the bear hid in a cave for 100</i>
<i>days and became the beautiful woman,</i>

14:31.829 --> 14:34.999
<i>I also started becoming pretty</i>
<i>while staying here.</i>

14:35.791 --> 14:37.251
Here's your new ID.

14:42.631 --> 14:43.799
Thank you.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.430
Are you looking for any specific perfume?

15:32.389 --> 15:34.516
I'd like to get this one, Pomelo.

15:34.642 --> 15:37.394
You're feminine and beautiful,
so it'll suit you well.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.608
I guess you have a date today.

15:42.858 --> 15:43.734
Pardon me?

15:45.152 --> 15:46.445
Well...

15:49.907 --> 15:52.242
I have to attend
college orientation tomorrow.

15:56.997 --> 15:58.707
<i>I've become pretty.</i>

15:59.375 --> 16:02.753
<i>The difference is really amazing.</i>

16:04.213 --> 16:05.172
<i>But the thing is...</i>

16:05.297 --> 16:07.549
BIG, ROUND EYES,
WELL-DEFINED, FEMININE NOSE

16:07.675 --> 16:10.010
<i>...it's a bit obvious</i>
<i>that I got plastic surgery.</i>

16:10.302 --> 16:12.304
<i>I'd say 79 out of 100?</i>

16:18.894 --> 16:20.896
"TAXICAB DRIVER'S PERMIT
KANG TAE-SIK"

16:23.440 --> 16:25.442
Hasn't the weather gotten much nicer?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.027
Yes.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.282
-That must be your daughter.
-Yes.

16:32.366 --> 16:35.494
She's majoring in chemistry
at Hankook University. A freshman.

16:35.577 --> 16:36.996
She must've had good grades.

16:37.079 --> 16:41.333
When I tell people that she never had
a tutor or took after-school classes,

16:41.417 --> 16:42.584
no one believes me.

16:42.668 --> 16:44.128
You don't either, do you?

16:44.712 --> 16:46.797
Kids who just aren't cut out for studying

16:46.880 --> 16:48.632
must find different paths early on.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.135
Kids should not go through
such tough ordeals.

16:51.844 --> 16:55.347
My daughter studied all by herself
and graduated at the top of her class.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.475
Top of the whole school,
not just her class!

16:59.309 --> 17:01.854
Anyway, she always studies so hard.

17:01.979 --> 17:03.897
Right after the college entrance exam,

17:03.981 --> 17:06.233
she went to the Philippines
to study English.

17:09.361 --> 17:14.241
Frankly, I always thought it'd be nice
for her to become a model.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.160
She's tall and slim.

17:18.412 --> 17:20.664
She's not that pretty,

17:20.748 --> 17:22.207
but she has such a cute face.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.878
Doesn't she look like that actress?
Wasn't her name Kim Go-eun?

17:29.173 --> 17:30.382
Kim Go-eun?

17:31.508 --> 17:34.094
Some say that my daughter is ugly,

17:34.261 --> 17:37.514
but she's prettier
than Kim Tae-hee to my eyes.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.518
You sure love your daughter a lot.

17:56.283 --> 17:58.911
<i>A new face and a new life.</i>

17:59.995 --> 18:04.333
<i>I want to be really happy</i>
<i>during my undergraduate years.</i>

18:08.670 --> 18:11.048
Hey, university student.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.967
What's up, university student?

18:14.051 --> 18:17.304
Shall we take a photo
to commemorate this historic moment?

18:28.190 --> 18:29.149
Shall we?

18:30.859 --> 18:33.529
I brought my selfie stick
for this very moment.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.697
-Nice.
-Hey, come closer.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.659
1, 2, 3!

18:39.076 --> 18:41.995
<i>Hyun-jung and I have been best friends</i>
<i>since middle school,</i>

18:42.079 --> 18:44.248
<i>but we didn't have</i>
<i>a single photo together.</i>

18:44.373 --> 18:45.707
Let's take it again.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.418
1, 2, 3.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.587
Isn't it so nice here? Come on.

18:50.671 --> 18:52.673
Let's take one here.

18:52.756 --> 18:56.969
<i>Because my ugly face looked</i>
<i>even uglier in photos.</i>

18:57.261 --> 18:59.346
1, 2, 3.

18:59.429 --> 19:00.639
1, 2, 3.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.350
What are you doing? Get it right.

19:03.433 --> 19:07.146
Hey, you look pretty in photos now.
Look, you're so pretty. One more time.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.856
1, 2, 3.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.569
What are you doing? Come on.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.195
-Okay.
-Look at the camera.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.828
Don't you think people keep looking at me?

19:26.540 --> 19:29.001
I hope it's not because I still look ugly.

19:29.126 --> 19:33.172
Gosh, do you want to hear me saying
it's because you're pretty? From me?

19:33.755 --> 19:35.174
Excuse me.

19:35.591 --> 19:38.594
Can I get your number
if that's okay with you?

19:40.512 --> 19:42.347
You're totally my type.

19:44.850 --> 19:45.726
Here.

19:48.520 --> 19:52.733
<i>You're totally my type.</i>

19:54.902 --> 19:56.820
-Hey.
-Yes?

19:56.945 --> 19:59.323
Come on, he's asking for your number.

20:02.868 --> 20:03.702
Oh...

20:04.828 --> 20:05.662
Well...

20:06.371 --> 20:07.456
The thing is,

20:08.207 --> 20:10.792
I don't have a phone number.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.297
Gosh, you can just say no.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.549
You did not have to embarrass me.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.927
You idiot.

20:20.260 --> 20:23.263
You don't have a phone number?
What kind of nonsense is that?

20:23.555 --> 20:24.556
I know.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.517
That didn't make sense at all.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.437
Hey, do you know what he just said to you?

20:31.438 --> 20:33.607
He said you're totally his type.

20:35.609 --> 20:36.777
What type am I?

20:36.860 --> 20:40.072
What do you think? You're the pretty type.

20:41.031 --> 20:44.952
Gosh, you needed some time to adjust
yourself to your new, pretty face.

20:45.702 --> 20:47.788
Hey, Kang Mi-rae.
Pull yourself together.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.082
Don't do anything stupid, okay?

20:52.167 --> 20:53.043
Let's go!

20:57.881 --> 21:00.300
Hey, are you going to give
that guy your number?

21:04.805 --> 21:05.764
Come on.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.062

Don't you have a girlfriend?

32:50.009 --> 32:51.886
-No.
-Did you break up with her?

32:51.970 --> 32:53.638
When did you break up with her?

32:55.181 --> 32:56.474
I'm not interested in girls.

You look like an actress. Right?

33:54.073 --> 33:56.075
You kind of look like an announcer, too.

33:57.702 --> 34:01.247
Can you guys drink?
We should start drinking as well.

34:01.330 --> 34:02.373
Okay.

34:03.750 --> 34:04.625
What?

34:05.126 --> 34:08.295
-What?
-What's this?

34:08.755 --> 34:12.341
How dare a freshman drink water?

34:13.176 --> 34:16.304
If I catch you acting all shy,
I'm going to have to scold you.

34:16.387 --> 34:17.221
So manly.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.264
-Let's fill our glasses.
-Let's do it.

34:19.348 --> 34:22.226
Yours is empty.
Jung-boon, I'll pour you a glass.

34:24.937 --> 34:25.772
Mi-rae, you too.

34:27.857 --> 34:30.234
Here we go. Bottoms up.

34:35.156 --> 34:37.324
Mi-rae,
do you really not have a boyfriend?

34:38.034 --> 34:39.744
What? No.

34:41.286 --> 34:43.414
Then can I be your boyfriend?

34:44.040 --> 34:44.873
Pardon?

34:46.918 --> 34:49.337
<i>♪ Love, love, love ♪</i>

34:49.545 --> 34:50.379
Bam!

34:50.505 --> 34:52.757
You're not as energetic as you used to be.

34:52.840 --> 34:54.300
Let's all fill our glasses.

34:54.382 --> 34:56.385
-Let's fill them up.
-Pour the drinks.

34:57.303 --> 35:00.306
Now, it's time for the games.

35:02.809 --> 35:04.102
<i>Ready, go.</i>

35:04.519 --> 35:08.648
<i>-Kim Sung-woon!</i>
<i>-Kim Sung-woon!</i>

35:09.065 --> 35:12.777
<i>-Kim Sung-woon!</i>
<i>-Kim Sung-woon!</i>

35:19.700 --> 35:21.661
Do Kyung-seok, you can do it!

35:26.582 --> 35:28.334
Wow!

35:28.626 --> 35:30.753
Do Kyung-seok!

35:31.879 --> 35:33.881
<i>Even if he's that Kyung-seok,</i>
<i>so what?</i>

35:34.423 --> 35:36.425
<i>He won't recognize me anyway.</i>

35:38.177 --> 35:39.137
Let's do it again.

35:39.887 --> 35:40.930
Finish drinking.

35:43.224 --> 35:46.310
-"Starry Night" by Mamamoo.
-"Starry Night" by Mamamoo!

35:46.435 --> 35:48.437
Correct, Choi Jung-boon!

35:52.150 --> 35:53.734
"Don't Know You" by Heize.

35:53.818 --> 35:55.987
Me! The answer is
"Don't Know You" by Heize.

35:56.362 --> 35:58.865
-Correct.
-What's with her?

36:07.582 --> 36:09.041
"Road Fighter" by Sechs Kies.

36:09.333 --> 36:10.877
"Road Fighter" by Sechs Kies.

36:13.171 --> 36:15.923
-Bingo. Oh, my.
-My goodness.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.717
My gosh, how did she know?

36:19.844 --> 36:22.805
-"Bboom Bboom" by Momoland.
-"Bboong Bboong" by Momoland!

36:22.889 --> 36:24.932
Again.
The pronunciation has to be precise.

36:25.057 --> 36:26.392
"Bboong Bboong."

36:26.475 --> 36:28.603
Wrong. It's not a fart.
What's the song?

36:28.686 --> 36:30.271
"Bboom Bboom"!

36:30.354 --> 36:34.775
Correct. Now, it's dance time, everyone!

36:43.868 --> 36:45.494
-Wi-Fi.
-Correct!

36:46.412 --> 36:48.414
Senior Koo Tae-young,
you got the correct answer.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.836
-Final exam.
-Final exam, correct!

36:54.337 --> 36:56.339
Congratulation!
Next.

36:56.756 --> 36:59.634
-Me! "The pot calling the kettle black."
-Bingo!

37:02.011 --> 37:03.304
Pass.

37:03.846 --> 37:05.473
Gosh, wrong. Wrong answer!

37:06.182 --> 37:09.644
-Mirror.
-Looks like I'm looking at myself?

37:13.272 --> 37:15.524
Give me a big hand for all the hard work!

37:18.152 --> 37:20.446
NATURAL SCIENCE DIVISION
AT HANKOOK UNIVERSITY

37:22.782 --> 37:24.617
The winning team at the moment is...

37:27.828 --> 37:30.248
Team 1 and Team 3 are
in first place together.

37:34.502 --> 37:38.547
The final match will be a talent
competition between the team leaders.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.220
-Me?
-Yes.

37:44.303 --> 37:46.305
You guessed all the songs correctly.

37:46.389 --> 37:48.557
I saw you could dance like this.

37:48.641 --> 37:53.020
She did?
My goodness, you must've partied a lot.

37:54.563 --> 37:56.774
Kang Mi-rae, you will be our team leader.

37:58.359 --> 38:00.361
No, I can't do things like that.

38:00.444 --> 38:02.780
-Don't worry. Just do it.
-Yes.

38:02.905 --> 38:06.993
-Kang Mi-rae, Kang Mi-rae!
-Kang Mi-rae, Kang Mi-rae!

38:07.576 --> 38:10.663
What should I do? They want me to dance
as the team's leader.

38:10.955 --> 38:13.457
<i>Then you must do your best</i>
<i>as the team leader.</i>

38:13.541 --> 38:14.959
No...

38:15.626 --> 38:18.045
Why does it have to be me? Why me?

38:18.337 --> 38:20.256
<i>You're a great dancer.</i>

38:20.339 --> 38:22.591
You couldn't resist flaunting your talent.

38:22.675 --> 38:25.678
Whatever happened already happened,
and you're a team leader.

38:25.761 --> 38:27.430
You must give it your all.

38:27.513 --> 38:31.392
If you get shy and don't do your best,
they will think that you're acting coy.

38:31.475 --> 38:34.270
With that face,
it'll come across as so obnoxious.

38:34.729 --> 38:37.523
I just want to run away.

38:37.690 --> 38:39.650
<i>Hey, Kang Mi-rae.</i>

38:39.734 --> 38:42.111
Don't be such a coward, okay?

38:42.236 --> 38:44.947
Nothing will change
if you keep avoiding challenges.

38:45.740 --> 38:47.742
<i>You don't want to live like you used to.</i>

38:48.659 --> 38:51.454
<i>You finally have the chance</i>
<i>to flaunt your charms, girl.</i>

38:51.537 --> 38:53.497
Show them what you've got.

38:57.084 --> 38:58.127
Will I...

39:00.880 --> 39:02.465
be able to do a good job?

39:02.631 --> 39:04.842
Of course. You're my friend after all.

39:04.925 --> 39:07.428
Go and have as much fun as you want.

39:07.636 --> 39:11.766
"This is how you should dance.
I am Kang Mi-rae, the dancing queen."

39:11.849 --> 39:13.392
Show them what you can do.

39:18.397 --> 39:20.983
I have to go.

39:21.734 --> 39:26.155
Hey, actually, I have to rap
as a leader of my team as well.

39:27.114 --> 39:29.784
Let's talk later. Peace.

41:33.949 --> 41:35.034
KANG MI-RAE

41:54.345 --> 41:56.222
<i>I wanted to show people</i>

41:57.348 --> 41:58.807
<i>that I can do a good job too.</i>

42:27.211 --> 42:29.046
<i>I wanted to show everyone.</i>

42:29.171 --> 42:31.173
-Kang Mi-rae!
-Kang Mi-rae!

42:31.298 --> 42:32.883
<i>Like everyone else,</i>

42:34.093 --> 42:35.886
<i>I wanted to be loved.</i>

42:35.970 --> 42:38.889
-Kang Mi-rae!
-Kang Mi-rae!

42:39.098 --> 42:40.432
<i>I wanted to</i>

42:42.268 --> 42:44.228
<i>be loved in an ordinary way.</i>

42:44.478 --> 42:47.231
-Kang Mi-rae!
-Kang Mi-rae!

42:50.776 --> 42:52.152
For Mi-rae!

42:52.278 --> 42:53.404
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

42:53.779 --> 42:55.447
Gosh, Mi-rae is so cool.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.913
Mi-rae, you're awesome.
You're like an idol singer.

43:03.205 --> 43:07.543
-Were you in a dance club?
-No, I practiced alone by watching TV.

43:08.085 --> 43:09.837
It's even more impressive then.

43:10.212 --> 43:13.674
Whatever. Let's drink a shot
with our arms crossed, Mi-rae.

43:17.761 --> 43:20.556
-Do it.
-Do it.

43:20.639 --> 43:22.808
-Do it.
-Hurry.

43:22.891 --> 43:25.519
-Do it.
-Do it.

43:26.312 --> 43:28.314
-Do it.
-Do it.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.608
Here. Like this.

43:30.899 --> 43:33.569
Mi-rae of the chemistry department is
our MVP!

43:33.736 --> 43:34.612
Mi-rae.

43:35.904 --> 43:38.616
It seems like
she's too drunk to drink.

43:40.159 --> 43:41.327
Please excuse me.

43:43.704 --> 43:46.332
How dare she try to act weak
in front of her senior?

43:47.041 --> 43:49.501
How about we do it together instead?

43:49.918 --> 43:50.878
Oh, no.

44:17.279 --> 44:19.281
I wish they wouldn't make me drink.

44:41.470 --> 44:45.099
-Kang Mi-rae!
-Kang Mi-rae!

44:45.182 --> 44:49.186
-Kang Mi-rae!
-Kang Mi-rae!

45:17.589 --> 45:18.882
Hi, Mom.

45:19.883 --> 45:21.635
What's wrong? Did something happen?

45:24.304 --> 45:25.848
Mom...

45:33.272 --> 45:34.940
Nothing.

45:36.066 --> 45:37.735
I'm having fun.

45:39.194 --> 45:42.322
People like me, Mom.

45:44.783 --> 45:47.870
I got startled. I thought
something happened to you.

45:48.954 --> 45:49.830
Really?

45:51.832 --> 45:54.042
I'm happy that you're having fun.

45:57.171 --> 46:01.550
<i>I'm getting a call.</i>
<i>Have fun. I'll call you again later.</i>

46:21.445 --> 46:24.740
Gosh, I shouldn't cry,
or my eyes will get red.

46:44.176 --> 46:47.763
You're really good at drinking.
Did you start in high school?

46:52.226 --> 46:53.227
That's cool.

46:55.479 --> 46:58.941
Don't you think it's a little hot in here?

46:59.650 --> 47:01.860
How about we go out for some fresh air?

47:03.070 --> 47:04.112
You can go alone.

47:12.538 --> 47:13.539
Where are you going?

47:14.998 --> 47:16.124
To get some fresh air.

47:20.879 --> 47:22.047
He's chic.

47:32.015 --> 47:34.434
You were really good at drinking
back there.

47:42.526 --> 47:43.652
Sorry.

47:44.027 --> 47:45.487
I think I'm drunk.

47:49.616 --> 47:51.618
I'm so foolish, don't you think?

47:52.244 --> 47:54.246
I get drunk after only a few shots.

47:57.791 --> 47:58.625
Excuse me.

48:03.171 --> 48:05.132
Does anyone have anything to sober her up?

48:05.924 --> 48:07.259
She says she's drunk.

48:11.513 --> 48:13.307
-Sua.
-Drink this.

48:13.390 --> 48:15.559
-It's best for sobering up.
-Get on my back.

48:15.642 --> 48:18.145
-I'll carry you on my back.
-It's really effective.

48:18.228 --> 48:19.104
Drink this.

49:07.819 --> 49:08.779
<i>What are you doing?</i>

49:08.862 --> 49:09.947
FROM: HYUN-JUNG

49:10.030 --> 49:11.114
<i>I'm outside.</i>

49:11.782 --> 49:14.201
<i>They keep telling me to drink</i>
<i>when I'm in there.</i>

49:16.620 --> 49:18.622
<i>Do you remember Do Kyung-seok?</i>

49:19.206 --> 49:20.707
<i>In our department...</i>

49:21.333 --> 49:22.167
Oh my gosh!

49:24.169 --> 49:25.045
<i>Hello?</i>

49:35.013 --> 49:36.139
<i>Hello?</i>

49:40.060 --> 49:41.311
<i>Hello?</i>

49:42.229 --> 49:44.231
I'm sure I called my daughter's number.

49:45.607 --> 49:46.817
Who's there?

49:47.442 --> 49:48.860
Oh, well...

49:51.738 --> 49:54.157
I'm Mi-rae's senior.

49:55.909 --> 49:59.579
<i>I see.</i>
<i>Why do you have her phone by the way?</i>

49:59.746 --> 50:01.039
Well, that's...

50:03.458 --> 50:06.503
Freshmen are not allowed to use
their phones during the event.

50:06.586 --> 50:08.547
So we collected them for the time being.

50:08.880 --> 50:10.882
<i>Oh, I see.</i>

50:11.967 --> 50:13.885
<i>-I'm sorry.</i>
-Not at all.

50:15.929 --> 50:16.930
I'm sorry.

50:17.014 --> 50:19.307
<i>It's okay.</i>
<i>Well, goodbye then.</i>

50:23.729 --> 50:25.188
Dad...

50:33.447 --> 50:36.324
You're home early.
Have you eaten dinner?

50:38.994 --> 50:41.580
What's wrong? Did something happen?

50:42.497 --> 50:44.499
She was just like Mi-rae.

50:46.918 --> 50:49.671
Did you talk to her on the phone?

50:49.755 --> 50:53.300
She looked pretty with round eyes
and a sharp nose.

50:54.217 --> 50:56.803
Well, that's...

50:57.596 --> 51:00.057
Ever since she graduated middle school,

51:00.599 --> 51:03.101
she wanted to do a plastic surgery
on her eyelids.

51:03.185 --> 51:04.144
What?

51:04.227 --> 51:06.813
She got so stressed out
because of her face.

51:06.897 --> 51:08.523
There you go again.

51:09.357 --> 51:12.486
What's wrong with her face
that you keep stirring up her mind?

51:12.903 --> 51:14.071
I already said no.

51:15.405 --> 51:17.699
Did I mishear because I miss my daughter?

51:18.033 --> 51:20.577
Her female senior took my call.

51:21.995 --> 51:23.997
Her voice sounded exactly like Mi-rae's.

51:25.248 --> 51:26.583
No way.

51:28.251 --> 51:30.253
She should've visited us first.

51:30.337 --> 51:32.923
Why did she have to go straight
to the orientation?

51:48.814 --> 51:49.815
Are you okay?

51:50.774 --> 51:51.650
What?

51:54.569 --> 51:55.445
Well...

51:57.572 --> 51:58.990
I'm okay.

51:59.908 --> 52:01.451
I just feel a little sick.

52:04.162 --> 52:05.080
Drink this.

52:08.667 --> 52:10.001
Thank you.

52:21.179 --> 52:23.223
Do you want to go rest
if you're too drunk?

52:23.348 --> 52:26.017
You might have to drink again
if you go back inside.

52:26.434 --> 52:28.436
There's a lounge with a sofa over there.

52:30.480 --> 52:32.232
Is there a place like that?

52:33.567 --> 52:34.776
Thank you.

52:46.079 --> 52:47.789
What are you waiting for?
Let's go.

53:44.054 --> 53:45.555
I should get some rest, too.

53:51.603 --> 53:54.481
Why are you standing there? Sit down.

53:58.276 --> 53:59.110
Okay.

54:15.835 --> 54:17.170
Aren't you uncomfortable?

54:17.837 --> 54:19.506
Sit down here comfortably.

54:20.924 --> 54:21.841
I'm okay.

54:23.593 --> 54:25.637
Why? Do I make you feel uncomfortable?

54:26.221 --> 54:28.223
Should we switch?
I'll sit over there.

54:28.348 --> 54:30.141
No, there's no need.

54:31.309 --> 54:32.560
Then I'll sit here.

54:58.211 --> 55:00.505
You're very pretty.

55:05.635 --> 55:06.928
Are you okay?

55:08.096 --> 55:09.097
I'm okay.

55:12.642 --> 55:14.352
I'm curious.

55:15.478 --> 55:17.105
Do you really not have a boyfriend?

55:19.065 --> 55:21.067
-No.
-Why?

55:23.069 --> 55:25.447
I just don't have one.

55:26.197 --> 55:27.032
I see.

55:34.080 --> 55:35.832
Then is it okay if  I like you?

55:36.291 --> 55:38.501
Looking at you playing games
and dancing earlier,

55:39.586 --> 55:41.129
I fell in love.

55:46.051 --> 55:48.553
<i>Is this a confession?</i>

55:50.930 --> 55:52.849
Don't think too seriously about it though.

55:57.354 --> 55:58.688
Oh, right.

56:00.106 --> 56:03.443
People might look for me
if I stay gone for too long.

56:07.197 --> 56:08.323
Who?

56:12.118 --> 56:15.372
No one else is more interested
in you than I am.

56:20.835 --> 56:22.921
They're busy having fun,

56:24.255 --> 56:25.215
so don't bother.

56:38.895 --> 56:39.813
Hey.

56:40.939 --> 56:42.941
Help me up already!

56:51.366 --> 56:53.493
What are you doing?

56:53.827 --> 56:54.911
What are you doing?

56:58.164 --> 56:59.541
It's none of your business.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.045
You came this way,
so I wondered what kind of place it was.

57:06.005 --> 57:08.258
What do you mean? It's no special place.

57:09.008 --> 57:12.595
She seemed too drunk, so I took her
so that she could rest for a while.

57:14.848 --> 57:17.142
Why did you open the door
when I was leaning on it?

57:19.519 --> 57:20.979
You were blocking the door.

57:25.859 --> 57:26.693
Are you drunk?

57:27.777 --> 57:29.779
Look at you being rude to your senior.

57:35.827 --> 57:38.830
I'm letting it go
because you're drunk, all right?

57:43.877 --> 57:44.961
Mi-rae. Let's go.

58:08.818 --> 58:09.736
Are you okay?

58:12.155 --> 58:14.824
Yes, I'm good.

58:22.040 --> 58:24.667
Rest here if you want to.

58:34.761 --> 58:35.887
Kang Mi-rae.

58:51.528 --> 58:52.529
By any chance,

58:55.073 --> 58:56.824
did you go to Jaryong Middle School?

59:07.877 --> 59:08.753
What?

59:26.563 --> 59:28.898
<i>Kyung-seok treats you differently</i>
<i>from others.</i>

59:28.982 --> 59:30.441
<i>Do you go out with him?</i>

59:30.525 --> 59:32.652
-She's already so famous.
-She's so pretty.

59:32.735 --> 59:33.653
Mi-rae.

59:33.736 --> 59:36.573
You and Mi-rae might get along
with each other very well,

59:36.656 --> 59:38.199
though I feel a little bad.

59:38.283 --> 59:40.034
I haven't done any plastic surgery.

59:40.118 --> 59:41.703
Mi-rae hasn't either.

59:41.786 --> 59:42.996
You think it's funny?

59:43.121 --> 59:44.539
Do you go to this university?

59:44.747 --> 59:46.207
I'm your daughter, Mi-rae.

59:46.708 --> 59:48.710
Gosh, you plastic monster.

59:49.043 --> 59:50.461
What have I done?

59:50.628 --> 59:53.339
Do you have a crush on him?

59:57.844 --> 59:59.846
