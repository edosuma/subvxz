00:02.150 --> 00:03.520
Tessa.

00:03.520 --> 00:04.720
I'm home.

00:10.380 --> 00:11.550
Tess.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.030
Tess, you here?

00:17.000 --> 00:23.074

00:41.010 --> 00:42.950
Oh. It's you.

00:42.950 --> 00:43.580
Who'd you think it was?

00:43.580 --> 00:45.130
I don't know. I heard rustling.

00:45.140 --> 00:47.110
And you were gonna fight them off with that?

00:47.120 --> 00:48.660
This could be very...

00:52.340 --> 00:53.010
What are you doing here?

00:53.010 --> 00:54.220
I thought you weren't coming till next weekend.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.360
I had to do laundry. I ran out of clothes.

00:56.810 --> 00:58.600
Already? It's only been two weeks.

00:58.600 --> 01:01.020
Not that I'm not thrilled to see you,

01:01.020 --> 01:03.130
But don't they have washing machines on campus?

01:03.140 --> 01:03.840
They're not as nice.

01:03.840 --> 01:06.000
And by "Nice," you mean "Free."

01:06.000 --> 01:07.540
- Pretty much.
- Right.

01:07.540 --> 01:10.870
Uh, you're going to need more orange juice, by the way.

01:10.870 --> 01:12.000
Thank you.

01:12.370 --> 01:16.220
Oh, and, um, I finished the ice cream... too.

01:17.470 --> 01:19.320
And... how long have you been here?

01:19.320 --> 01:21.210
Ten minutes.

01:21.210 --> 01:23.080
Well, as long as you are here,

01:23.090 --> 01:25.380
how about a Guitar Hero tournament?

01:25.380 --> 01:28.500
I have been writing all weekend. I could use a break.

01:29.040 --> 01:30.560
Actually, I gotta go.

01:30.560 --> 01:32.240
I'm meeting some friends for a study session

01:32.240 --> 01:33.040
and I'm already late.

01:33.040 --> 01:35.210
Uh, well, what about your laundry?

01:35.770 --> 01:38.280
It's okay. I mean, I'll get it later.

01:38.280 --> 01:40.090
- Bye, dad.
- Bye.

01:40.090 --> 01:41.940
I mean, she came home at least, right?

01:41.940 --> 01:44.470
Yeah, I just wish it was for more than laundry and supplies.

01:44.470 --> 01:45.400
Did you get some writing done?

01:45.410 --> 01:46.750
With mother gone, are you kidding?

01:46.750 --> 01:48.780
Two chapters, but I gotta rewrite the crime scene.

01:48.780 --> 01:49.750
Right now it's boring.

01:49.760 --> 01:52.230
Maybe this will inspire you, Castle.

01:52.290 --> 01:53.670
Pretty damn freaky.

01:54.470 --> 01:56.740
Name's Tessa Horton, 29.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.360
Roommate came home from a weekend away,

01:58.360 --> 01:59.800
found her up there.

02:00.090 --> 02:01.320
Ooh, jeez.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.780
Who puts a body on a ceiling?

02:02.790 --> 02:05.390
Beats me, but I probably won't sleep for weeks.

02:05.390 --> 02:06.810
Looks like something out of one of your books, right?

02:06.810 --> 02:07.570
Cause of death?

02:07.570 --> 02:10.650
Ligature marks and petechia suggest strangulation.

02:10.650 --> 02:12.120
What about this wound on her forehead?

02:12.120 --> 02:13.050
Well, it's nonlethal.

02:13.050 --> 02:15.870
Given the detail, it looks like it was carved by some kind of razor.

02:15.870 --> 02:17.490
It's a symbol of some kind.

02:17.490 --> 02:18.390
Do you recognize it?

02:18.390 --> 02:20.640
No, but the killer went through a lot of trouble.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.410
It must mean something.

02:21.410 --> 02:22.950
It's not easy hanging a body,

02:22.950 --> 02:25.050
and she's at least 100 pounds.

02:25.050 --> 02:26.680
I checked in with CSU.

02:26.690 --> 02:28.050
They found prints in the hallway,

02:28.050 --> 02:29.460
but the apartment is spotless.

02:29.460 --> 02:31.030
Looks like it's been wiped down.

02:31.030 --> 02:32.580
This guy cleaned up after himself.

02:32.580 --> 02:34.430
He didn't mind taking his time.

02:34.430 --> 02:37.550
So the killer knew that the roommate was gonna be out of town.

02:37.550 --> 02:39.180
What's the security like in this place?

02:39.180 --> 02:40.380
Buzzer on the front door,

02:40.380 --> 02:41.840
no doorman or security cameras.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.500
But there's no sign of a forced entry,

02:43.500 --> 02:44.990
no sign of a struggle.

02:45.980 --> 02:47.130
She knew him.

02:48.900 --> 02:50.350
All right, canvass neighboring apartments

02:50.350 --> 02:52.220
for anyone that saw or heard anything,

02:52.230 --> 02:54.350
And I want to know what this symbol means.

02:55.770 --> 02:57.200
You know, if Tessa knew our killer,

02:57.210 --> 03:00.780
it's possible that her roommate could shed some light on all of this.

03:00.830 --> 03:03.940
Every time I close my eyes, I see her hanging there.

03:05.400 --> 03:06.740
What did she do for a living?

03:07.230 --> 03:10.770
She was an insurance broker for commercial real estate.

03:10.770 --> 03:12.300
Kurtzman Insurance.

03:12.300 --> 03:13.530
Did she have a lot of friends?

03:13.540 --> 03:15.090
She was shy...

03:15.750 --> 03:16.730
And a workaholic.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.290
I practically had to drag her out of the house.

03:19.290 --> 03:20.790
So no boyfriend then?

03:23.380 --> 03:25.110
Actually, she did start seeing someone,

03:25.110 --> 03:26.670
maybe six weeks ago.

03:26.670 --> 03:27.700
Do you know who?

03:27.700 --> 03:30.510
That's the thing, she never did say. She...

03:31.330 --> 03:32.950
She acted like it was some big secret,

03:32.950 --> 03:35.340
like maybe he was married or something.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.650
But he bought her jewelry

03:37.700 --> 03:40.160
and took her to these fancy dinners.

03:42.120 --> 03:44.780
She said no one's ever treated her that way before.

03:45.130 --> 03:47.220
Did she tell you anything else about him,

03:47.220 --> 03:49.760
The way he looked, where they met?

03:49.890 --> 03:50.880
No.

03:51.130 --> 03:54.140
All she said was he was every woman's fairy tale...

03:54.320 --> 03:56.330
Rich, handsome, and generous.

03:57.920 --> 03:59.600
Well, some fairy tale.

03:59.750 --> 04:01.570
I'll tell you this much, there's a lot more to this story

04:01.570 --> 04:03.390
than an affair with a married man.

04:03.390 --> 04:06.030
Maybe, but we won't know what until we find him.

04:06.030 --> 04:08.440
Get on her phone records. See if you can ID this guy.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.060
Yeah. I'll have 'em pull her e-mails, too.

04:10.060 --> 04:11.250
Anything on that symbol yet?

04:11.250 --> 04:12.360
Put a call into the feds.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.230
They're running it through their database right now.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.670
What?

04:20.680 --> 04:23.370
The way he left the body, the time it took...

04:23.370 --> 04:24.890
whoever did this,

04:25.250 --> 04:26.470
he liked it.

04:28.750 --> 04:31.000
If she had a boyfriend, nothing happened that night.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.740
There are no signs of sexual assault or activity.

04:33.740 --> 04:35.420
Death was by strangulation.

04:35.420 --> 04:37.350
Looks like a rope or a scarf.

04:37.350 --> 04:38.750
Were you able to narrow down a time?

04:38.750 --> 04:41.810
Somewhere between 2:00 and 3:00 A.M. Saturday morning.

04:41.810 --> 04:44.030
Lividity and pooling indicate the body was hung

04:44.030 --> 04:45.900
from the ceiling postmortem.

04:45.900 --> 04:48.690
Why would he hang her body after he killed her?

04:48.690 --> 04:49.610
A ritual?

04:49.610 --> 04:51.100
That's not all that's weird.

04:51.100 --> 04:53.490
Strangulation is a violent act,

04:53.490 --> 04:55.610
But there were no signs that she fought back...

04:55.610 --> 04:58.600
No skin under the fingernails, no bruising...

04:58.600 --> 05:00.240
So I did some checking.

05:00.430 --> 05:01.620
She was drugged.

05:01.620 --> 05:04.750
Lung tissue suggests exposure to chloroform.

05:04.750 --> 05:07.190
Also... your killer was careful.

05:07.190 --> 05:09.060
He was wearing gloves.

05:09.070 --> 05:09.950
How can you tell?

05:09.950 --> 05:11.970
Traces of talcum powder on the body...

05:11.970 --> 05:14.300
The same talc used in surgical gloves

05:14.300 --> 05:17.450
Or the evidence gloves that you use at the crime scenes.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.020
Whoever this person is,

05:19.020 --> 05:21.170
they knew exactly what they were doing.

05:21.430 --> 05:22.940
He's done this before.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.250
Ritualistic killing,

05:24.250 --> 05:25.210
takes pleasure in it,

05:25.210 --> 05:28.250
significant care exhibited at the crime scene...

05:28.250 --> 05:30.310
All the hallmarks of a serial killer.

05:30.310 --> 05:32.300
Yeah, but I've never seen this M.O.

05:32.300 --> 05:33.370
Hey, bad news.

05:33.370 --> 05:35.080
The feds struck out on the symbol.

05:35.080 --> 05:38.090
It bears some similarities to some ancient alchemy signs,

05:38.090 --> 05:39.400
But they've never seen this one before.

05:39.400 --> 05:40.640
Any luck on the phone records?

05:40.640 --> 05:41.670
No, but she spent

05:41.670 --> 05:44.120
a lot of time on the phone to a blocked number.

05:44.120 --> 05:45.110
Phone company traced it

05:45.110 --> 05:47.740
to an unlisted burner phone with a stolen sim.

05:47.740 --> 05:49.040
- So he planned ahead.
- Yeah.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.280
What about her e-mails?

05:50.280 --> 05:51.900
Nothing from her mystery lover,

05:51.900 --> 05:53.410
so I had them take a look at her hard drive.

05:53.410 --> 05:56.150
Turns out portions of it have been surgically wiped,

05:56.150 --> 05:57.780
like someone covering their tracks.

05:57.780 --> 05:59.180
So we're back to square one.

05:59.470 --> 06:00.460
Not necessarily.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.820
Uh, Tessa's roommate said that he gave her some jewelry.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.930
Maybe he left a fingerprint on one of those pieces.

06:04.930 --> 06:06.930
I'll head to her place, see what I can find out.

06:07.790 --> 06:10.520
Jewelry. I never would've thought of that.

06:11.330 --> 06:13.340
I guess I'll have to remind you when my birthday's coming up.

06:13.890 --> 06:14.780
Why, Detective Beckett,

06:14.780 --> 06:16.260
was that a hint you just dropped?

06:16.260 --> 06:19.070
Why, Mr. Castle, I do believe it was.

06:19.070 --> 06:20.020
Shameless.

06:20.020 --> 06:21.980
Yo, Beckett, you got a second?

06:21.980 --> 06:22.950
I need a word.

06:26.070 --> 06:27.710
Okay. So...

06:28.870 --> 06:29.350
What's up?

06:29.350 --> 06:31.350
We got the C.S.U. Report back.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.490
The inside of Tessa's apartment was wiped clean.

06:33.490 --> 06:34.940
Yeah, well, we expected that.

06:34.940 --> 06:36.470
Yeah, but we didn't expect this.

06:37.020 --> 06:39.860
C.S.U. were able to pull prints off the outside doorknob

06:39.860 --> 06:41.160
and from around the door frame.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.530
And they found a set that didn't match Tessa's or her roommate's.

06:44.530 --> 06:45.070
When they ran it,

06:45.070 --> 06:46.970
they found a match to someone else in the system.

06:46.970 --> 06:48.040
Okay. Who?

06:49.250 --> 06:50.410
Richard Castle.

06:57.020 --> 06:59.530
Y...uh, that can't be right.

06:59.530 --> 07:01.920
You know what? It w...it was probably just an accident.

07:01.930 --> 07:04.360
He probably touched them on his way in

07:04.360 --> 07:05.730
before putting his gloves on.

07:05.730 --> 07:07.670
Yeah, I mean, that would explain it,

07:07.940 --> 07:11.770
Except that C.S.U. Collected them before either of you arrived.

07:30.120 --> 07:31.340
Are you sure about this?

07:31.340 --> 07:32.540
Look for yourself, bro.

07:33.020 --> 07:35.170
Castle, think. Is it possible

07:35.170 --> 07:38.190
that you touched the doorknob or the frame on your way in?

07:38.190 --> 07:41.760
It was open when I came in, but I guess I must have.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.200
Had you been in that building before?

07:43.200 --> 07:44.470
Not before today.

07:44.530 --> 07:45.840
What about the victim?

07:46.390 --> 07:47.460
Are you sure you didn't know her?

07:47.460 --> 07:48.350
Javi.

07:49.040 --> 07:49.940
What?

07:49.940 --> 07:50.830
You know I have to ask.

07:50.830 --> 07:52.050
No, it's simple, okay?

07:52.050 --> 07:53.530
He touched the door when he walked in.

07:53.530 --> 07:55.010
C.S.U. Got the time frame wrong.

07:55.010 --> 07:56.430
That's the only explanation.

07:56.430 --> 07:57.870
Unless I've got an evil twin.

07:57.870 --> 07:59.350
Twins don't have the same fingerprints.

07:59.360 --> 08:01.410
It's a common misconception. This was you.

08:01.710 --> 08:03.060
Yeah, I know. I was joking.

08:03.060 --> 08:05.220
A contaminated crime scene is not a joke.

08:05.220 --> 08:07.030
I'll square this away with C.S.U.

08:07.030 --> 08:08.680
You watch your hands next time, okay?

08:08.970 --> 08:09.730
Sorry.

08:12.420 --> 08:13.470
Just be careful.

08:13.470 --> 08:14.670
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

08:16.160 --> 08:16.560
Beckett.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.380
So I've been through all of Tessa's belongings.

08:18.380 --> 08:20.240
No sign of any high-end jewelry,

08:20.240 --> 08:22.030
but from the empty spaces in her jewel box,

08:22.030 --> 08:23.570
there might be some pieces missing.

08:24.060 --> 08:25.270
He took back the ones he gave her.

08:25.270 --> 08:26.550
It's like he knew what we were looking for.

08:26.550 --> 08:28.310
This guy really knows how to cover his tracks.

08:28.310 --> 08:29.510
Oh, no, not all of them.

08:29.510 --> 08:31.090
Canvass of the building turned up a neighbor

08:31.090 --> 08:32.799
who claims he saw someone heading to her apartment

08:32.799 --> 08:34.620
at 7:45 on Friday night.

08:34.620 --> 08:35.870
Did the neighbor get a good look at him?

08:35.870 --> 08:36.970
Well, he got a clear shot

08:36.970 --> 08:38.490
right through his front door peephole.

08:38.490 --> 08:39.960
I'm bringing in a sketch artist right now.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.860
All right. Get it over as soon as it's done.

08:41.860 --> 08:43.289
The roommate might be able to I.D. him.

08:43.299 --> 08:43.799
You got it.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.080
Detective.

08:52.430 --> 08:54.690
The roommate identified him as Tessa's boss,

08:54.690 --> 08:57.460
Lloyd Kurtzman, CEO of Kurtzman Insurance Brokerage.

08:57.460 --> 08:58.270
Any priors?

08:58.270 --> 08:58.960
Nothing major.

08:58.960 --> 09:00.520
He's got a couple of harassment suits,

09:00.530 --> 09:02.430
but he does have a sealed juvie file.

09:02.430 --> 09:03.990
A juvie file?

09:03.990 --> 09:05.150
Call Judge Markaway.

09:05.150 --> 09:06.790
If Kurtzman was torturing puppies as a kid,

09:06.790 --> 09:07.810
I want to know.

09:09.130 --> 09:11.920
Good-looking and rich, huh? Just like Tessa's mystery man.

09:11.920 --> 09:14.740
And like Tessa's mystery man, he's married.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.300
She was such a glowing presence.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.500
You couldn't help but notice her.

09:20.990 --> 09:23.100
You know, it's hard to imagine anyone wanting to kill her.

09:23.340 --> 09:24.600
I'm sure it is.

09:25.050 --> 09:26.320
Were the two of you close?

09:26.320 --> 09:28.000
As close as I am to any of my employees.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.960
And when was the last time that you saw her?

09:31.010 --> 09:31.850
Friday morning

09:32.190 --> 09:33.380
at our staff meeting.

09:33.380 --> 09:35.210
Friday morning? Are you sure?

09:36.450 --> 09:37.190
Yes.

09:37.200 --> 09:39.230
Not friday evening?

09:39.840 --> 09:40.650
No, uh...

09:40.650 --> 09:45.010
So you didn't go to Tessa's apartment at 7:45?

09:47.500 --> 09:49.600
Her...her apartment? No, no.

09:49.600 --> 09:50.480
That's funny.

09:50.960 --> 09:54.860
We, um, we have a witness that saw you there that night.

09:59.620 --> 10:02.350
Mr. Kurtzman, where were you Friday night?

10:10.210 --> 10:12.190
I-I'd like to speak to my lawyer now.

10:16.040 --> 10:17.490
He's not talking.

10:17.490 --> 10:19.590
I guess a confession was too much to hope for.

10:19.590 --> 10:21.630
Some story that might explain it all.

10:21.630 --> 10:23.330
Yeah, we've got teams at his home and his office.

10:23.330 --> 10:24.610
We'll know more after the search,

10:24.610 --> 10:26.040
but Esposito talked to his wife,

10:26.040 --> 10:28.170
and she said he didn't come home that night.

10:28.530 --> 10:30.210
He was working late.

10:30.210 --> 10:32.260
I'm guessing he wasn't at work.

10:32.260 --> 10:33.340
No.

10:34.980 --> 10:36.480
I wonder if there were others

10:36.480 --> 10:38.100
or if she was the first,

10:38.100 --> 10:42.610
if her "Glowing presence" awakened something inside him.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.140
What's wrong?

10:46.010 --> 10:47.270
It's...

10:47.270 --> 10:49.380
It's just that crime scene.

10:49.380 --> 10:50.210
What about it?

10:50.220 --> 10:52.500
The person that killed Tessa was meticulous,

10:52.500 --> 10:55.940
but when we questioned Kurtzman, he got all flustered.

10:55.950 --> 10:56.780
So?

10:56.780 --> 10:59.300
So if he put that much thought into killing her,

10:59.300 --> 11:02.500
then why didn't he have an alibi prepared?

11:02.500 --> 11:04.710
Perhaps because he was so meticulous,

11:04.710 --> 11:06.580
he didn't expect to get caught.

11:16.740 --> 11:18.210
Hey. What'd you find?

11:18.210 --> 11:19.440
Well, they're still processing,

11:19.440 --> 11:21.850
but so far there's nothing at his house or office

11:21.850 --> 11:23.320
that connects Kurtzman to the murder.

11:23.320 --> 11:24.440
Did you check his e-mails?

11:24.440 --> 11:26.810
Yeah. There's no mysterious deletions from his hard drive,

11:26.810 --> 11:28.220
no unusual activity,

11:28.220 --> 11:29.440
nothing in his phone records, either.

11:29.440 --> 11:30.590
Okay, well, that's not a surprise.

11:30.590 --> 11:31.680
I mean, if he's done this before,

11:31.680 --> 11:32.930
he knows how to cover his tracks.

11:32.930 --> 11:34.010
What about his juvie record?

11:34.020 --> 11:36.710
A couple of fights, stole a neighbor's car.

11:36.710 --> 11:38.280
Nothing that explains this.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.040
So then all we have is the neighbor's ID?

11:40.040 --> 11:41.540
That's not enough to make a case.

11:41.540 --> 11:43.190
I think I might have found something that can help,

11:43.190 --> 11:45.250
Something Kurtzman may have missed.

11:45.380 --> 11:46.300
A diamond earring?

11:46.300 --> 11:47.540
We found it in the couch.

11:47.540 --> 11:48.910
C.S.U. couldn't pull a print off it,

11:48.910 --> 11:49.950
But you see the design?

11:49.960 --> 11:52.200
That's custom... Erica Courtney.

11:52.210 --> 11:53.770
And you know this how?

11:53.770 --> 11:56.540
I recognized it from when Jenny and I went ring shopping.

11:56.540 --> 11:58.260
Anyway, I called up the showroom.

11:58.260 --> 11:59.670
They confirmed it's one of theirs.

11:59.670 --> 12:01.110
And do they have a record of who they sold it to?

12:01.110 --> 12:02.490
Yeah, I ran the name and the address.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.340
They're both fake.

12:03.340 --> 12:04.420
What about the credit card info?

12:04.420 --> 12:06.740
Well, buyer paid with a cashier's check. 12 grand.

12:06.740 --> 12:09.140
So we have no way of tracing him or the payment.

12:09.150 --> 12:11.550
No, but the store uses digital surveillance,

12:11.550 --> 12:13.740
And they just sent over the tapes.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.490
Here's the time code for our point of sale.

12:20.490 --> 12:22.100
That's our guy.

12:22.190 --> 12:23.230
Look at his height,

12:23.230 --> 12:24.850
build, hair color.

12:24.850 --> 12:26.600
That's not Kurtzman.

12:26.810 --> 12:29.190
That's... Castle.

12:33.680 --> 12:35.250
There's another explanation.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.140
Like what?

12:36.140 --> 12:38.240
I don't know, okay? It's somebody else.

12:38.240 --> 12:39.570
Someone that looks like Castle.

12:39.570 --> 12:42.000
We found his fingerprints at the crime scene.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.440
We got him on video buying jewelry for our victim.

12:44.440 --> 12:45.600
It can't be a coincidence.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.830
Javi, what are you saying, that Castle's a killer?

12:47.840 --> 12:49.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no. None of us are saying that.

12:49.960 --> 12:50.930
All he's saying is that

12:50.940 --> 12:53.090
If it were anyone else, we'd look into it.

12:53.630 --> 12:55.700
We can start by looking at his financials,

12:55.700 --> 12:57.010
See if there's any unusual activity

12:57.010 --> 12:58.790
around the time of the purchase.

13:05.030 --> 13:06.120
Fine.

13:06.120 --> 13:07.310
But we do it quietly,

13:07.310 --> 13:09.420
and he never finds out about it.

13:15.450 --> 13:16.130
What are you doing?

13:16.130 --> 13:18.180
Uh, Javi, there's something you need to know.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.320
Beckett and Castle?

13:20.610 --> 13:22.330
W...uh...w-when did they start?

13:22.330 --> 13:23.380
I'm not sure.

13:23.380 --> 13:25.550
But I know they were together that weekend in the Hamptons.

13:25.550 --> 13:26.790
Why wouldn't she tell us?

13:26.790 --> 13:28.640
I guess she was afraid Gates would find out,

13:28.640 --> 13:31.070
use NYPD regs to give Castle the boot.

13:31.070 --> 13:32.400
I was gonna keep it a secret myself,

13:32.410 --> 13:34.950
but, ah, under the circumstances...

13:35.170 --> 13:36.790
Normally, I'd be happy for them.

13:36.790 --> 13:38.970
Yeah. Hey.

13:39.640 --> 13:40.230
You don't really think

13:40.230 --> 13:42.190
that Castle had anything to do with this, do you?

13:42.190 --> 13:44.480
No. Come on, man. He's my friend, too.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.900
The best thing we can do is try to prove this evidence wrong.

13:47.900 --> 13:49.160
Yeah.

13:50.780 --> 13:52.440
Hey, Javi.

14:00.820 --> 14:01.750
Wait a minute.

14:01.750 --> 14:03.280
Did I throw a party and forget again?

14:03.290 --> 14:04.710
It's not a party.

14:06.010 --> 14:08.270
Search warrant, gloves...

14:08.270 --> 14:09.460
Okay, guys,

14:09.470 --> 14:11.690
I get it... the fingerprint thing.

14:11.690 --> 14:14.440
I'm sorry. Lesson learned. You can all go home.

14:14.440 --> 14:16.050
It's not a joke, bro.

14:17.310 --> 14:18.820
Take him to the kitchen.

14:19.210 --> 14:20.740
The kitchen? I just...

14:24.120 --> 14:25.570
Beckett.

14:25.890 --> 14:27.570
Beckett, what is this?

14:28.120 --> 14:31.080
We found a piece of jewelry in Tessa's apartment

14:31.080 --> 14:34.660
and we traced it back to the man that bought it for her.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.430
Castle, it was you.

14:38.510 --> 14:40.010
What are you talking about?

14:40.880 --> 14:46.130
It was purchased with a cashier's check for $12,780.

14:46.130 --> 14:48.710
Earlier that day, you withdrew the same amount of money

14:48.710 --> 14:52.280
from your pocket account as a cashier's check.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.680
You looked into my financials?

14:54.680 --> 14:55.790
You're investigating me?

14:55.790 --> 14:57.960
- Castle....
- Kate, this is not me.

14:57.960 --> 14:59.270
And I didn't buy any jewelry.

14:59.270 --> 15:00.740
I certainly didn't use a cashier's check.

15:00.740 --> 15:02.690
Then you need to explain it.

15:02.700 --> 15:05.710
This, the withdrawal, the fingerprint...

15:05.710 --> 15:08.870
You need to tell me what the hell's going on.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.310
Beckett.

15:11.680 --> 15:13.100
In here.

15:29.370 --> 15:30.670
What is it?

15:31.880 --> 15:33.470
Guys, what is it?

15:35.290 --> 15:36.860
Kate.

15:38.260 --> 15:39.830
Richard Castle,

15:39.830 --> 15:42.250
you're under arrest for the murder of Tessa Horton.

15:43.290 --> 15:44.740
Turn around.

15:51.140 --> 15:52.720
You have the right to remain silent.

15:52.740 --> 15:56.300
Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.

16:03.360 --> 16:06.050
The bag is part of a set that he owns.

16:06.060 --> 16:07.530
The wire and hooks are identical

16:07.530 --> 16:09.990
to the ones used to bind the victim.

16:10.060 --> 16:11.340
There was also a shirt inside

16:11.340 --> 16:12.970
that had some blood spatter on it.

16:12.970 --> 16:15.100
The lab says it's a match to Tessa's.

16:15.100 --> 16:15.960
What's he saying?

16:15.960 --> 16:18.940
That he's never seen any of it before in his life.

16:19.380 --> 16:21.540
Sir, he's not a killer.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.480
Then how do you explain all of this?

16:23.480 --> 16:26.050
The evidence isn't the whole story.

16:26.050 --> 16:27.400
Castle's taught me that.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.240
You know, I'm not always a fan of Mr. Castle's, Detective,

16:30.240 --> 16:31.740
But even I'm having trouble believing

16:31.740 --> 16:34.060
He'd do something so heinous.

16:34.070 --> 16:35.720
So then what do we do?

16:35.840 --> 16:37.180
Our jobs.

16:37.180 --> 16:39.820
Check his e-mails, computer files, and phone records.

16:39.820 --> 16:41.050
If he was involved with this girl,

16:41.050 --> 16:42.360
there's bound to be a record.

16:42.360 --> 16:44.070
Beckett, you talk to the family,

16:44.070 --> 16:46.160
see if anyone else has access to his place.

16:47.430 --> 16:48.830
Sir.

16:49.730 --> 16:50.620
Thank you.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.020
Don't thank me yet, detective.

16:52.020 --> 16:54.870
We're gonna follow the evidence no matter where it leads us.

17:01.230 --> 17:04.200
You guys, when you look through Castle's phone records...

17:04.200 --> 17:05.650
It's okay.

17:05.970 --> 17:07.089
We know.

17:07.089 --> 17:09.660
We won't tell Gates unless we have to.

17:09.660 --> 17:11.310
You know?

17:12.760 --> 17:13.680
How?

17:13.680 --> 17:16.050
Well, I mean, it... it's us, so...

17:16.050 --> 17:17.560
We didn't say anything because we figured

17:17.560 --> 17:20.310
it was nobody's business, but we gotta ask,

17:20.310 --> 17:21.450
were you with him that night?

17:21.450 --> 17:23.109
No. Uh...

17:23.109 --> 17:24.940
He, uh...

17:26.150 --> 17:27.369
I-I was supposed to be.

17:27.369 --> 17:29.270
His, um, mom was out of town,

17:29.270 --> 17:33.660
and then he said that he needed time to write.

17:41.820 --> 17:43.260
Where's Beckett?

17:43.600 --> 17:44.890
Under the circumstances,

17:44.890 --> 17:48.220
I think it's best if I handle the interrogation.

17:48.310 --> 17:50.110
Come on, Captain. This is insane.

17:50.110 --> 17:51.150
I didn't do anything.

17:51.150 --> 17:52.390
Well, we still need to investigate,

17:52.390 --> 17:53.220
and you know that,

17:53.230 --> 17:56.250
so let's start with your relationship to the victim.

17:56.250 --> 17:57.640
Okay. I didn't have one.

17:57.640 --> 17:59.830
Then any idea how your fingerprints ended up

17:59.830 --> 18:00.990
at the crime scene?

18:00.990 --> 18:03.680
Well, we went over that. C.S.U. made a mistake.

18:03.680 --> 18:05.210
They say they didn't.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.790
Castle, if you knew her...

18:06.790 --> 18:08.160
I didn't know her.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.510
She was seeing someone,

18:09.510 --> 18:12.450
someone her roommate described as handsome and rich.

18:12.450 --> 18:14.160
I'm flattered, but it wasn't me.

18:14.170 --> 18:15.430
Detective.

18:15.430 --> 18:17.170
His family's here.

18:19.480 --> 18:21.650
- Where's Richard?
- What's going on?

18:24.530 --> 18:26.930
Of course it has my fingerprints on it. It's my bag.

18:26.930 --> 18:28.420
But I didn't put that stuff in there.

18:28.420 --> 18:29.800
Then who did?

18:29.820 --> 18:31.130
What about Kurtzman?

18:31.130 --> 18:33.240
We know he was at her apartment that night,

18:33.240 --> 18:34.310
and he lied about it.

18:34.310 --> 18:35.810
Kurtzman alibied out.

18:35.810 --> 18:38.520
What? When?

18:38.520 --> 18:39.770
An hour ago.

18:39.770 --> 18:41.390
His lawyer got him to cooperate.

18:41.390 --> 18:43.590
- Turns out, he was lured there.
- Lured?

18:43.590 --> 18:45.550
By a text message Tessa sent,

18:45.550 --> 18:47.070
only it wasn't from Tessa.

18:47.070 --> 18:48.330
It was from a burner phone.

18:48.330 --> 18:49.680
When Kurtzman showed up at Tessa's,

18:49.680 --> 18:50.980
she told him that she didn't send it,

18:50.980 --> 18:52.810
so she sent him on his way.

18:52.810 --> 18:54.610
Well, then why did he lie about it?

18:54.900 --> 18:58.040
Because he spent the rest of the evening with a paid companion

18:58.040 --> 19:00.210
and didn't want his wife to know.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.740
So...

19:06.250 --> 19:08.610
What about you, Mr. Castle?

19:08.810 --> 19:11.510
Where were you the night of the murder?

19:14.280 --> 19:16.250
I was at home writing.

19:16.270 --> 19:17.850
And did anyone see you there?

19:17.850 --> 19:19.700
No, I was...

19:20.010 --> 19:21.080
Alone.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.090
So for the record,

19:23.090 --> 19:25.960
you're saying you have no alibi.

19:29.940 --> 19:31.910
I think I'd like my lawyer now.

19:31.910 --> 19:33.210
Well, this is madness.

19:33.210 --> 19:34.620
This is just madness.

19:34.620 --> 19:37.000
It's temporary. We just need to find out the truth.

19:37.000 --> 19:39.310
Now can anyone else access your apartment?

19:39.310 --> 19:40.430
Does anyone have keys?

19:40.430 --> 19:42.090
Well, Alicia, the housekeeper.

19:42.090 --> 19:43.730
Yeah, but she's been with us for 15 years.

19:43.730 --> 19:45.050
And there's a security system.

19:45.060 --> 19:47.180
Even if someone had a key, the alarm would go off.

19:47.180 --> 19:48.860
Have you noticed anyone out of the ordinary

19:48.860 --> 19:50.680
in the building lately... a maintenance worker,

19:50.680 --> 19:53.200
delivery man, anyone that could've been casing the place?

19:53.200 --> 19:55.620
No, no, no, no. Nothing.

19:57.710 --> 19:59.500
Thanks. I'll be here.

20:10.510 --> 20:12.430
Castle, whoever is behind this,

20:12.560 --> 20:13.660
Whatever is going on,

20:13.660 --> 20:15.760
I will figure this out. I promise.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.070
I know.

20:20.860 --> 20:23.190
In the meantime, you have some visitors.

20:23.510 --> 20:24.230
Dad.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.530
Oh, Richard.

20:28.030 --> 20:29.570
Oh, darling.

20:33.840 --> 20:34.740
What?

20:37.590 --> 20:39.420
Tech just finished with Castle's computer.

20:39.420 --> 20:42.550
Parts of it had been wiped, just like Tessa's.

20:45.130 --> 20:47.550
Were they able to re... recover anything?

20:47.830 --> 20:49.840
They found a file that he had deleted.

20:50.220 --> 20:53.220
It was a story concept about how to commit the perfect murder.

20:53.890 --> 20:56.600
Beckett, the character gets away with it

20:56.600 --> 20:59.010
by staging a crime scene so bizarre,

20:59.010 --> 21:01.920
The cops can't see he's hiding right under their noses.

21:02.140 --> 21:05.050
It was like a-a dry run on paper,

21:05.330 --> 21:06.800
all the way down to the weird symbol

21:06.800 --> 21:08.410
that we found on the victim's forehead.

21:09.180 --> 21:10.690
We found something else on his drive.

21:11.090 --> 21:13.680
E-mails... dozens of 'em,

21:14.000 --> 21:16.060
between Castle and the victim.

21:19.380 --> 21:20.300
Beckett...

21:22.460 --> 21:24.030
They've been having an affair.

21:33.700 --> 21:35.660
They started up about eight weeks ago

21:35.660 --> 21:37.140
according to those e-mails.

21:37.420 --> 21:41.040
He met her after one of his... book signings,

21:41.040 --> 21:42.350
and he asked her out for coffee,

21:42.360 --> 21:43.330
and that was...

21:44.770 --> 21:45.830
That was just a couple of weeks

21:45.830 --> 21:47.850
after we started seeing each other.

21:47.850 --> 21:49.170
Oh, sweetie.

21:49.430 --> 21:52.290
He told her that he needed to keep it a secret

21:52.290 --> 21:54.260
because he was with someone else.

21:55.830 --> 21:58.440
And then when he tried to break it off about a week ago,

21:58.440 --> 22:00.560
she threatened to go and tell his girlfriend.

22:01.880 --> 22:04.110
He offered to come over to her apartment

22:04.110 --> 22:05.670
to talk things through,

22:06.270 --> 22:08.010
and that was the night of the murder.

22:09.200 --> 22:10.520
He had motive.

22:11.540 --> 22:13.730
What did Castle say when you talked to him?

22:14.030 --> 22:16.180
He said that the e-mails were faked.

22:17.380 --> 22:19.390
He said he never wrote that story,

22:19.390 --> 22:21.070
and that he was being framed.

22:24.160 --> 22:25.610
You should've seen him, Lanie.

22:25.610 --> 22:27.880
He looked like a little boy, he was so scared.

22:30.930 --> 22:33.420
I know him, Lanie.

22:34.010 --> 22:35.260
He is...

22:36.340 --> 22:39.160
an immature, egotistical...

22:41.090 --> 22:43.530
self-centered jackass sometimes,

22:43.530 --> 22:45.120
but he's not this.

22:48.820 --> 22:49.950
Are you sure?

23:05.040 --> 23:06.800
They say dogs can smell fear.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.740
Did you know that some humans can as well?

23:12.290 --> 23:13.290
You reek of it.

23:15.530 --> 23:16.510
Tyson.

23:16.730 --> 23:18.140
I prefer 3XK.

23:19.640 --> 23:22.760
How long has it been since I left you

23:22.760 --> 23:24.820
and Detective Ryan in that motel room?

23:24.960 --> 23:28.250
Somebody! Help! Somebody! I need some help in here!

23:28.250 --> 23:29.260
They can't hear you

23:29.840 --> 23:30.850
or see you.

23:30.890 --> 23:33.010
I'm afraid I'm much more thorough than that.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.070
You did this.

23:36.480 --> 23:37.600
You killed Tessa.

23:37.630 --> 23:40.700
She's not my type. I prefer blondes.

23:40.880 --> 23:41.880
Remember?

23:42.010 --> 23:44.250
Here's a much more believable story...

23:44.390 --> 23:46.270
You killed Tessa.

23:46.820 --> 23:48.290
It practically writes itself.

23:48.290 --> 23:50.880
After all, you commit murder every day in your mind

23:50.880 --> 23:51.960
for your books.

23:52.480 --> 23:54.840
It's not hard to imagine that you'd eventually...

23:55.430 --> 23:56.590
cross the line.

23:57.230 --> 23:58.560
Why are you doing this, Tyson?

23:59.460 --> 24:00.730
Four years, Castle.

24:02.070 --> 24:05.740
I gave up four years of my life

24:05.930 --> 24:08.240
planning the perfect vanishing act.

24:08.290 --> 24:10.350
So that the cops would stop looking for me,

24:10.440 --> 24:11.990
so that I could begin again,

24:12.080 --> 24:13.690
could begin killing again

24:13.710 --> 24:15.390
So that I could taste that fear...

24:16.400 --> 24:17.340
again.

24:18.190 --> 24:19.190
Four years.

24:20.830 --> 24:21.970
You ruined it.

24:22.640 --> 24:24.070
Well, if it's revenge you wanted,

24:24.070 --> 24:25.380
why not just kill me?

24:25.510 --> 24:26.740
Where's the fun in that?

24:26.980 --> 24:29.930
Oh, no, no, it's more fun to destroy you.

24:29.990 --> 24:32.620
Why do you think I let you live that night in the motel?

24:32.720 --> 24:35.560
People think it's killing that I like,

24:35.560 --> 24:36.920
but murder's just an act.

24:37.680 --> 24:42.550
It's all about the anticipation, the planning.

24:43.310 --> 24:46.920
Watching you and your daughter taking a walk,

24:48.950 --> 24:50.660
you and Beckett making love...

24:52.250 --> 24:54.780
Standing in your living room,

24:54.890 --> 24:56.460
being inside your life,

24:58.260 --> 25:00.360
knowing that I'm gonna take it all away from you...

25:02.880 --> 25:03.820
that's what I like.

25:06.310 --> 25:07.630
You won't get away with this.

25:07.780 --> 25:08.650
Oh, please.

25:09.570 --> 25:12.100
What are you gonna do, you gonna tell 'em that I came here?

25:12.450 --> 25:13.720
You think that they're gonna

25:14.090 --> 25:16.660
believe the lies of a desperate man?

25:18.230 --> 25:19.270
Beckett will.

25:19.310 --> 25:22.260
Well, even if she does...

25:23.670 --> 25:24.570
She can't save you.

25:24.580 --> 25:25.360
There's no time.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.740
When the D.A. files charges tomorrow,

25:28.050 --> 25:29.730
they're gonna send you to Central Booking...

25:29.820 --> 25:30.820
The tombs.

25:31.880 --> 25:32.980
I have people waiting...

25:33.450 --> 25:34.410
for you.

25:34.720 --> 25:37.540
You will not last the night.

25:39.660 --> 25:40.930
And that'll be her punishment...

25:41.250 --> 25:42.630
Believing that you were innocent,

25:42.630 --> 25:43.820
and not being able to stop it.

25:45.940 --> 25:47.430
It'll haunt her for the rest of her life.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.970
Lucky for you... you'll be dead.

26:13.500 --> 26:16.390
We went through the surveillance footage from last night.

26:16.950 --> 26:19.890
There's no evidence that Jerry Tyson was in the station,

26:19.890 --> 26:21.320
and there is no evidence

26:21.520 --> 26:23.500
that the system had been tampered with.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.140
Beckett, I swear to you, he was here.

26:25.140 --> 26:27.230
- Castle.
- No, I know. I sound crazy.

26:27.230 --> 26:29.630
A desperate story from a desperate man, just...

26:30.570 --> 26:31.710
just like he wanted.

26:31.740 --> 26:33.540
You're right, it does sound desperate.

26:36.450 --> 26:39.420
But it's the first time that this story has made sense.

26:43.370 --> 26:44.420
You believe me?

26:45.510 --> 26:46.680
I never stopped.

26:59.710 --> 27:01.080
He's gonna kill me, Kate.

27:02.040 --> 27:03.850
I can't run, I can't hide.

27:05.530 --> 27:06.770
What am I supposed to do?

27:09.690 --> 27:11.380
I'm telling you, it's the triple killer.

27:11.380 --> 27:14.100
Strangulation, misdirects, planting evidence...

27:14.110 --> 27:15.480
It's Tyson's M.O.

27:15.540 --> 27:18.890
3XK targeted multiple victims, always women, never men.

27:18.890 --> 27:19.750
So why the change?

27:19.750 --> 27:22.630
Revenge. That's the only thing that explains everything.

27:22.630 --> 27:25.250
No, not everything. Not that video of Castle.

27:25.260 --> 27:26.280
Yeah, actually, it might.

27:26.280 --> 27:28.310
Tyson did something similar in the Russo case.

27:28.310 --> 27:30.080
He used a double for the cameras to throw us off.

27:30.080 --> 27:32.190
Sir, the D.A. has already filed charges.

27:32.190 --> 27:34.210
They're gonna send him to Central Booking today.

27:34.330 --> 27:36.750
We know that we can prove this. We just need more time.

27:37.740 --> 27:39.480
You want the D.A.'s office to do what?

27:39.620 --> 27:42.740
All we're asking for is a delay until we can sort all this out.

27:42.740 --> 27:45.100
No, what you're asking for is preferential treatment

27:45.100 --> 27:46.360
for a murder suspect.

27:46.540 --> 27:47.610
You want to sort this out,

27:47.610 --> 27:49.150
you sort it out after he's arraigned.

27:49.150 --> 27:50.050
No, I don't think you understand.

27:50.050 --> 27:51.340
There's not gonna be an after.

27:51.340 --> 27:53.040
If it's his safety you're concerned about,

27:53.040 --> 27:54.970
we're prepared to put him in protective custody.

27:54.970 --> 27:57.150
Do you have any idea who you're dealing with?

27:57.150 --> 27:58.510
Do you even know what Jerry Tyson

27:58.510 --> 28:01.350
has proven himself capable of?

28:02.650 --> 28:05.350
Who do you think met with the families of his victims

28:05.530 --> 28:06.390
and held their hands

28:06.400 --> 28:08.530
when he slipped through your fingers, detective?

28:08.880 --> 28:11.350
I'm very aware of what 3XK is capable of.

28:11.360 --> 28:12.990
Then you should know that your protective custody

28:13.060 --> 28:14.230
isn't worth a damn.

28:14.240 --> 28:17.370
If he wants to kill Castle, he's gonna find a way to do it.

28:18.630 --> 28:20.720
Captain Gates, aside from your

28:20.740 --> 28:23.520
unsubstantiated claim from a murder suspect,

28:23.530 --> 28:25.680
can you offer the D.A.'s office one shred of evidence

28:25.680 --> 28:27.180
of 3XK's inolvement?

28:28.910 --> 28:30.310
Not at this time.

28:31.160 --> 28:32.400
Then we're done here.

28:33.960 --> 28:35.300
I've spent some time in Central.

28:35.300 --> 28:36.490
I've seen the tombs,

28:36.490 --> 28:38.130
the way they stack bodies in those cells.

28:38.440 --> 28:40.020
If there's a bounty on Castle's head,

28:40.040 --> 28:41.520
protective custody ain't gonna do jack.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.080
That's assuming Tyson paid off a prisoner.

28:43.080 --> 28:44.060
It could be a guard.

28:44.190 --> 28:46.160
So we can't protect him, not there.

28:52.090 --> 28:53.810
We have to stop that transfer.

28:54.630 --> 28:57.210
We need evidence that 3XK was involved.

28:57.540 --> 28:58.610
Yeah, but we got nothing to go on.

28:58.610 --> 29:01.870
Okay, to pull this off, he needed access to Castle's loft.

29:01.870 --> 29:04.070
So get teams over there and tear that place apart.

29:04.070 --> 29:05.800
Find me a fingerprint, a hidden microphone,

29:05.800 --> 29:08.250
a broken window jamb, anything that puts him there.

29:08.420 --> 29:11.050
Tessa was seeing someone. If it wasn't Castle...

29:11.210 --> 29:12.490
Then maybe it was Tyson.

29:12.990 --> 29:13.990
Hit her office.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.880
Look for files, schedules, client lists.

29:15.880 --> 29:17.670
There's gotta be something that ties back to him.

29:27.160 --> 29:28.890
I just heard from the team at Castle's loft.

29:29.550 --> 29:30.410
Nothing yet.

29:31.970 --> 29:33.870
So it's gonna happen just like Tyson said, huh?

29:34.840 --> 29:36.540
I'm not gonna be able to save him in time.

29:36.880 --> 29:37.910
Well, we're not done yet.

29:40.600 --> 29:45.160
How secure is holding?

29:45.660 --> 29:47.050
What? Whoa. You're not even thinking about that.

29:47.050 --> 29:48.970
We're talking about his life. We can't let them take him.

29:48.970 --> 29:50.480
Are you crazy? It would never work.

29:50.480 --> 29:51.640
You'll never even get out of holding.

29:51.640 --> 29:52.400
Tyson did it.

29:52.410 --> 29:53.870
Because nobody was looking for him.

29:53.890 --> 29:55.980
He had weeks to plan it, maybe even longer. Y...

29:56.390 --> 29:57.820
I know how you feel about the guy.

29:58.630 --> 29:59.730
I love him, too.

30:00.180 --> 30:02.000
But there's nothing we can do.

30:02.420 --> 30:03.360
Beckett.

30:03.920 --> 30:05.340
They're here.

30:19.460 --> 30:20.640
This is so much less fun

30:20.640 --> 30:22.560
than the other night at your place.

30:23.820 --> 30:26.380
Do you remember the first time you handcuffed me?

30:26.380 --> 30:28.870
We were at the New York Public Library.

30:29.690 --> 30:30.660
Remember how angry you were

30:30.660 --> 30:33.230
that I wouldn't stop investigating that case?

30:34.030 --> 30:35.840
Yeah, I remember.

30:36.150 --> 30:38.600
What I wouldn't give to be there now.

30:42.170 --> 30:43.420
Castle...

30:43.980 --> 30:45.450
This isn't over.

30:45.450 --> 30:48.320
I promise you, I will get you out.

30:48.320 --> 30:50.000
It's okay.

30:50.510 --> 30:52.180
Whatever happens,

30:52.610 --> 30:54.330
it's okay.

31:35.620 --> 31:36.590
I'm sorry.

31:36.590 --> 31:39.530
Don't be sorry. I don't need sorry.

31:39.530 --> 31:40.770
I need to find this son of a bitch

31:40.770 --> 31:42.360
and put him in the ground.

31:43.810 --> 31:45.070
Detective Beckett.

31:45.550 --> 31:46.160
What?

31:46.160 --> 31:47.850
We're here to transport one of yours to Central...

31:47.850 --> 31:50.580
A, uh, Richard Castle?

31:59.270 --> 32:00.980
Yes, I'm looking at the transfer...

32:00.980 --> 32:05.480
No, the paper work said the badge number was 871324.

32:06.290 --> 32:08.100
The Central Booking said it never arrived,

32:08.100 --> 32:09.950
they don't know where the hell he is.

32:09.950 --> 32:11.630
Right. OK.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.970
The badge numbers on the paperwork don't exit.

32:13.970 --> 32:15.190
They were imposters.

32:15.190 --> 32:16.810
It's gotta be Tyson. He sets this up.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.970
He isn't gonna have Castle killed.

32:18.980 --> 32:19.790
He's gonna kill him himself.

32:19.790 --> 32:22.040
Well, the D.A. is calling it a prisoner escape.

32:24.740 --> 32:26.510
What? They think Castle did this?

32:26.510 --> 32:27.720
As far as their concern,

32:27.720 --> 32:29.380
he's well connected, knows our procedure,

32:29.380 --> 32:31.210
and has substantial resources.

32:31.210 --> 32:32.620
That's ridiculous.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.140
You two keep working the Tyson angle.

32:36.140 --> 32:37.640
I've got this.

32:37.970 --> 32:39.710
Resources.

32:42.940 --> 32:44.140
Can you believe that?

32:44.970 --> 32:46.030
Branding Castle a fugitive

32:46.030 --> 32:48.490
when he's probably being held captive by a serial killer?

32:48.970 --> 32:49.800
So what's our next...

32:52.420 --> 32:53.580
move?

33:16.380 --> 33:17.780
Oh, thank God you're okay.

33:17.780 --> 33:19.900
Thank God you understood my message.

33:21.490 --> 33:22.960
The first time that I cuffed you...

33:22.960 --> 33:25.520
What you wouldn't give to be back there now.

33:26.490 --> 33:27.550
- Come on.
- Yeah.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.840
I knew I couldn't call once I left.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.280
Castle, how did you do it? How did you escape?

33:34.280 --> 33:35.900
- I've got a great lawyer.
- Come on.

33:35.900 --> 33:37.820
Someone owned me a favor. The less you know, the better.

33:37.820 --> 33:40.150
But the good news is, I'm still alive.

33:40.150 --> 33:42.650
The D.A. has branded you a fugitive.

33:42.650 --> 33:44.590
Every cop in New York is looking for you.

33:44.590 --> 33:45.870
Yes, well, they won't be the only ones

33:45.870 --> 33:47.470
after the 5:00 news.

33:47.470 --> 33:50.150
And by now they've tagged my phone, my house, my accounts.

33:50.150 --> 33:52.480
I'm not gonna last long out here. We have to act quickly.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.920
I've got teams at your place looking for any trace of Tyson.

33:54.920 --> 33:57.230
Ryan is wading through paperwork at Tessa's office

33:57.230 --> 33:58.680
to see if there's a connection.

33:58.680 --> 34:01.040
Well, that could take weeks. I think I got something better.

34:01.040 --> 34:02.750
Sitting in holding, I kept thinking,

34:02.750 --> 34:04.660
how could he possibly pull this off?

34:04.660 --> 34:07.960
How could he get video of me buying those earrings?

34:07.960 --> 34:09.460
And then it hit me...

34:10.610 --> 34:12.070
"Broadway Casting"?

34:12.070 --> 34:15.050
You want someone to play a role, you cast it.

34:16.130 --> 34:17.370
Look at this notice from four months ago

34:17.370 --> 34:18.780
by a celebrity lookalike firm.

34:18.780 --> 34:20.310
"A private book club party."

34:20.310 --> 34:21.570
Look who they're looking for.

34:21.570 --> 34:22.400
"James Patterson,

34:22.409 --> 34:23.050
Stephen King,

34:23.060 --> 34:23.610
J.K. Rowling"...

34:23.610 --> 34:25.790
And... me.

34:28.409 --> 34:29.800
Yeah, we placed that ad.

34:29.800 --> 34:32.800
Sent a couple of headshots over to the client's P.O. Box,

34:32.800 --> 34:34.010
but never heard back.

34:35.510 --> 34:37.420
Uh, could I get the address?

34:37.420 --> 34:38.639
Sure.

34:38.820 --> 34:40.840
And did you send over any Richard Castles?

34:40.840 --> 34:42.290
Let me check.

34:44.790 --> 34:45.840
Just one.

34:45.840 --> 34:48.120
Great. We'll need his information as well.

34:48.239 --> 34:49.449
Okay, thanks.

34:49.980 --> 34:52.929
So the P.O. Box the agency sent the headshots to

34:52.929 --> 34:55.650
was paid for in cash and rented for a month.

34:55.650 --> 34:57.770
The owners gave no forwarding address.

34:57.770 --> 34:59.150
It's a dead end.

34:59.150 --> 35:00.490
Well, Tyson might be a dead end,

35:00.490 --> 35:02.110
but Richard Castle isn't.

35:02.110 --> 35:03.410
Look, it's me.

35:05.660 --> 35:07.650
Yeah, people come up sometimes,

35:07.650 --> 35:09.350
asking me to sign your books.

35:09.350 --> 35:11.110
So I figured I'd submit.

35:11.760 --> 35:13.180
I never heard back.

35:13.180 --> 35:15.270
You know, uh, now that I'm up close,

35:15.270 --> 35:16.650
I really don't see it.

35:16.650 --> 35:18.220
Uh... so, uh,

35:18.220 --> 35:19.990
i-is this you?

35:21.070 --> 35:22.170
Yeah.

35:22.170 --> 35:24.790
That was for a reality show on store security.

35:24.790 --> 35:28.050
It was an odd gig. They sent me in to buy earrings.

35:28.050 --> 35:30.860
And was this man involved somehow?

35:31.050 --> 35:33.140
He looks a little like the show's producer.

35:33.930 --> 35:37.070
You wouldn't happen to have his contact information, would you?

35:37.930 --> 35:39.020
What do you mean, he's with you?

35:39.020 --> 35:40.000
How did he escape?

35:40.000 --> 35:42.380
Espo, not now. I need an address.

35:42.600 --> 35:44.720
All right, well, the address for the show's producer is another dead P.O. Box

35:46.490 --> 35:48.020
and the phone number's defunct.

35:48.210 --> 35:49.840
Okay, what about his paycheck?

35:49.840 --> 35:51.140
Well, I talked to the bank,

35:51.140 --> 35:53.530
and the corporate account that cut the check is closed.

35:53.530 --> 35:54.950
And the corporate contact,

35:54.950 --> 35:57.490
Joseph Vacher, well, doesn't seem to exist.

35:57.490 --> 36:00.350
Yeah, he exists, all right. Or at least he used to.

36:00.350 --> 36:03.000
Joseph Vacher is a famous French serial killer

36:03.000 --> 36:04.260
from the late 1800s.

36:04.260 --> 36:05.520
So he's got a sense of humor.

36:05.520 --> 36:06.810
Have any other checks been written

36:06.810 --> 36:08.420
from that corporate account?

36:09.260 --> 36:11.810
Yeah, cut to a...

36:12.050 --> 36:13.410
Kurtzman Insurance.

36:13.410 --> 36:15.050
Tessa worked for them.

36:15.650 --> 36:18.220
So there's no mention of Vacher in her policy files...

36:18.660 --> 36:22.380
but there was an entry in her calendar.

36:22.570 --> 36:23.300
Yeah, here it is.

36:23.300 --> 36:26.380
Six weeks ago... site visit with a J.V.

36:26.380 --> 36:27.650
Well, that's him. It has to be.

36:27.650 --> 36:28.990
Did she write anything else with it...

36:28.990 --> 36:31.370
a phone number, e-mails, an address?

36:31.370 --> 36:33.460
No phone number, but there is an address.

36:33.460 --> 36:35.170
Maybe where they went for the site visit.

36:35.170 --> 36:36.420
Looks like it's in northern Manhattan

36:36.420 --> 36:37.160
near the bridge.

36:37.160 --> 36:39.130
Castle, he was posing as a building owner

36:39.130 --> 36:40.030
looking for insurance.

36:40.030 --> 36:42.190
He probably found an empty property.

36:42.190 --> 36:43.550
Could be worth a look.

36:43.550 --> 36:45.900
Kev, hook up with Espo and meet us there.

36:45.900 --> 36:46.800
You got it.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.670
Someone saw the news. We gotta go.

36:59.470 --> 37:01.120
Owner says it's unoccupied.

37:01.120 --> 37:02.960
Hasn't been a tenant for nearly a year.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.460
Then who's up there?

37:04.460 --> 37:06.850
Could be someone or it could be just a light.

37:07.700 --> 37:09.710
- Did you just see that?
- All right, guys. Let's move. Come on.

37:33.050 --> 37:34.210
It was nothing.

37:34.210 --> 37:35.640
Just a sheet.

37:38.860 --> 37:40.020
You guys.

37:40.020 --> 37:41.480
Over here.

37:58.380 --> 38:00.370
Once he'd obtained Castle's print from his loft,

38:00.370 --> 38:02.350
he used a binding agent and some rubber cement

38:02.350 --> 38:04.480
to build a latex model of his fingerprint.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.060
Surveillance photos,

38:06.060 --> 38:08.200
architectural plans for Castle's loft...

38:08.200 --> 38:09.120
A precinct map,

38:09.120 --> 38:11.630
including the locations of all of our video cameras...

38:11.630 --> 38:14.080
He orchestrated everything right down to the last detail.

38:14.080 --> 38:15.740
He even implicated Kurtzman

38:15.740 --> 38:18.410
to make it look like Castle was covering his tracks.

38:18.410 --> 38:19.330
I don't get it.

38:19.330 --> 38:21.600
Why go through all this just to set you up?

38:21.600 --> 38:23.570
Because death only takes a moment.

38:23.570 --> 38:26.720
The preparation and pageantry, that's what he loves.

38:27.070 --> 38:29.100
Well, Mr. Castle,

38:29.100 --> 38:30.770
it looks like you're off the hook.

38:30.770 --> 38:32.120
I've spoken to the DA,

38:32.120 --> 38:34.330
and they'll be dropping all charges.

38:34.330 --> 38:35.660
Thank you, sir.

38:35.720 --> 38:36.910
For this, at least.

38:36.910 --> 38:40.120
There's still the matter of your escape from custody.

38:40.120 --> 38:42.460
However, under the circumstances,

38:42.460 --> 38:45.690
I'm pretty sure you can negotiate down to time served.

38:45.910 --> 38:48.170
Uh, detective, why don't you take him down to the station,

38:48.170 --> 38:49.580
start the paperwork?

38:50.960 --> 38:53.150
So the tactical team searched the whole building.

38:53.150 --> 38:54.270
No sign of him.

38:54.270 --> 38:55.820
When CSU finishes,

38:55.820 --> 38:58.100
fall back and put the building under surveillance.

38:58.100 --> 39:00.080
What if he's already seen us and he doesn't come back?

39:00.080 --> 39:03.190
Every cop in this city is looking for him.

39:03.190 --> 39:04.770
He won't get far.

39:26.730 --> 39:27.970
You okay?

39:29.000 --> 39:30.120
Yeah.

39:31.610 --> 39:33.960
Just finding that stuff of Tyson's...

39:34.160 --> 39:35.960
It seems lucky.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.060
Yeah, well, sometimes luck is all you need.

39:39.060 --> 39:41.770
He can't hide now. We'll find him.

39:42.250 --> 39:44.030
Thank you.

39:44.180 --> 39:45.410
For what?

39:45.920 --> 39:47.730
Believing in me.

39:47.730 --> 39:50.720
I mean, given my reputation, my history...

39:50.720 --> 39:52.040
when you saw those e-mails,

39:52.040 --> 39:54.370
it would've been real easy not to.

39:54.370 --> 39:57.270
Yeah, well, things have never been easy between you and me.

39:59.650 --> 40:01.740
Maybe that's what makes it all worth...

40:14.260 --> 40:16.110
It's Tyson. Castle, get down!

40:35.500 --> 40:37.450
Come here, Kate. Come here.

40:37.530 --> 40:38.790
Castle!

40:38.790 --> 40:40.710
I got your girl!

40:40.710 --> 40:42.590
Are you watching?

40:42.590 --> 40:44.370
I want you to see this.

40:45.960 --> 40:49.230
You think that I'd let you live after everything you've done?

40:50.280 --> 40:51.310
Castle!

40:51.310 --> 40:53.300
Come on. I want you to watch.

40:53.300 --> 40:56.030
I want you to watch as I take her life.

41:02.680 --> 41:04.260
Over here.

41:39.300 --> 41:41.800
The water's pretty murky. Haven't seen anything yet.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.450
They still haven't found the body.

41:46.380 --> 41:47.780
They won't.

41:47.780 --> 41:49.320
He's not dead.

41:49.320 --> 41:50.450
Castle, what are you saying?

41:50.450 --> 41:52.270
This was never about me.

41:52.750 --> 41:54.310
This was about him.

41:54.310 --> 41:55.800
Those initials in her date book?

41:55.800 --> 41:57.570
He's not that careless.

41:58.260 --> 42:00.230
He wanted us to find that place.

42:00.230 --> 42:02.600
He wanted us on this bridge.

42:03.770 --> 42:05.260
Tessa's murder, the frame up...

42:05.260 --> 42:07.790
all of it was to get us here so we could help him do

42:07.790 --> 42:09.770
what he couldn't do for himself...

42:10.620 --> 42:12.850
disappear so he can start killing again.

42:12.850 --> 42:14.480
You think he planned this?

42:14.860 --> 42:18.180
How does a wanted man stop being wanted?

42:20.480 --> 42:23.520
It has to be public and it has to be final.

42:23.770 --> 42:25.980
Do you know how crazy that sounds?

42:26.140 --> 42:28.200
No one's gonna be looking for him anymore.

42:29.580 --> 42:31.050
You shot him.

42:31.420 --> 42:33.810
He's dead. It's over.

42:43.450 --> 42:44.850
For now.
