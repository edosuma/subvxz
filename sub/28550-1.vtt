San Fransokyo.

00:05.420 --> 00:07.420
Greatest city in the world.

00:07.420 --> 00:09.000
Once threatened
by nefarious forces,

00:09.000 --> 00:11.330
now a beacon of peace,

00:11.330 --> 00:13.330

fearless fortitude

00:13.330 --> 00:15.120

-What?

00:19.080 --> 00:22.540
Falling from a chair is
a major cause of injuries.

00:22.540 --> 00:23.880
Would you like a step-ladder?

00:23.880 --> 00:25.540
Oh, no. I'm good.

00:25.540 --> 00:28.080
I guess I just got carried away
with my excitement about today.

00:28.080 --> 00:29.380
Wednesday?

00:29.380 --> 00:32.500
No...although, Wednesdays
are pretty underrated.

00:32.500 --> 00:36.000
I mean, today is
the start of Phase Two!

00:36.000 --> 00:37.540
Uh...Phase Two?

00:37.540 --> 00:39.420
Ah, Hiro.
(chuckles)

00:39.420 --> 00:41.330
Sometimes I forget
how young you are.

00:41.330 --> 00:45.170
Defeating Obake was
the epic conclusion
to Phase One.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.750
Phase...One...

00:46.750 --> 00:48.540
Of the Big Heroverse!

00:48.540 --> 00:50.790
And now, it's time
for all new adventures.

00:50.790 --> 00:52.710
Thus, Phase Two.

00:52.710 --> 00:54.790
Is it still Phase Two
if nothing happens?

00:54.790 --> 00:57.540
(chuckles)
So young, so innocent.

00:57.540 --> 00:59.540
Something always
happens, Hiro.

00:59.540 --> 01:02.290
Only in Phase 2
it's way bigger.

I trust you will all be
supportive of Karmi
and her new internship.

-It's an internship,
it's-it's not a big deal.
-You're right.

02:34.790 --> 02:36.080
It's a huge deal.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.500
Hiro, are you feeling
competitive with Karmi
again?

02:38.500 --> 02:40.580
What?! No, I--

02:40.580 --> 02:42.580
Grace! Sorry to keep
you waiting.

02:42.580 --> 02:44.790
I was stuck in
a holo-conference.

02:44.790 --> 02:46.380
You know how
tedious those are.

02:46.380 --> 02:47.670
Let's get this
tour started!

02:47.670 --> 02:49.170
This is my
assistant, Chris.

02:49.170 --> 02:51.710
Oh! Do the joke,
do the joke with
my name.

02:51.710 --> 02:53.290
My Chris-sistant.

02:53.290 --> 02:57.500
(laughing) She makes
me laugh...anywho.

02:57.500 --> 02:59.960
Your name tags have been
individually programmed

02:59.960 --> 03:02.580
to display your age,
height, interests...

03:02.580 --> 03:05.960
-And names?
-Of course...Wasabi.

03:05.960 --> 03:06.830
(chuckles)

03:06.830 --> 03:08.830
He knows my name!

03:10.380 --> 03:12.580
I don't see Sycorax
as just another
bio-tech company.

03:12.580 --> 03:14.710
Mother nature is an artist,

03:14.710 --> 03:16.170
and I see myself
as her protégé.

03:16.170 --> 03:18.710
Studying and even
improving on her work.

03:18.710 --> 03:20.170
Inspiring.

03:20.170 --> 03:23.120
I favor a holistic approach
to the work-life balance.

03:23.120 --> 03:25.670
In fact, right now,
you're walking on
bio-metric scanners,

03:25.670 --> 03:27.080

to your name tags.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.960

03:28.960 --> 03:30.830
-Watch...

03:57.040 --> 03:58.580
Maybe not
that important.

03:58.580 --> 04:01.670
Karmi,
this is your lab?!

04:01.670 --> 04:03.540
Oh, just temporarily.

04:03.540 --> 04:06.120
My real lab is being
modified to my specs.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.420

What're you talking about?

04:36.540 --> 04:37.710
Home.

04:37.710 --> 04:39.830
Home is gone,
father's gone.

04:39.830 --> 04:40.830
Not daddy's house--

04:40.830 --> 04:42.120

04:42.120 --> 04:44.710
See ya around,

04:50.000 --> 04:51.880
-Ugh!

Nice shot.

05:04.500 --> 05:07.210
Yes! Yes!

05:10.460 --> 05:11.880
So cool, I love it.

05:11.880 --> 05:14.380
-Yes!
-Ba-la-la-la-la.

05:14.380 --> 05:15.210
Hello.

05:15.210 --> 05:17.330

05:17.330 --> 05:18.290
It was incredible!

05:18.290 --> 05:19.920

Chris-sistant.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.540
It wasn't so great.

05:21.540 --> 05:23.580
Uh, did you see his smile?

05:23.580 --> 05:25.920
(sniffing)
Hold on.

05:25.920 --> 05:28.250

05:28.250 --> 05:30.750

locally-sourced ceviche?

05:30.750 --> 05:32.750
-Yes.
-Honey Lemon:
Hiro's got Karmi issues.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.210
Again.

05:34.210 --> 05:35.580
She got
an internship.

05:35.580 --> 05:37.710
Woo-hoo,
when's the parade?

05:37.710 --> 05:39.330
-(triumphant music)
-Baymax: Tuesday.

05:39.330 --> 05:41.620
We have all just
received invitations.

05:41.620 --> 05:42.710

05:45.830 --> 05:47.250
-(phone notification)
-Yes!

05:49.500 --> 05:50.580
Hard maybe.

05:50.580 --> 05:52.460
Ughh!

05:52.460 --> 05:54.170
I'm gonna need
an internship.

05:54.170 --> 05:56.380
No one's gonna hire you
if you're just in it
to be competitive.

05:56.380 --> 05:58.170
Yeah, it's kind of shallow.

05:58.170 --> 06:01.620
Competitive...shallow...yeah!

06:01.620 --> 06:03.750
I usually don't take
same-day appointments.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.210
But when you
want to talk,

06:05.210 --> 06:07.040
it usually means my life
is in danger, so...

06:07.040 --> 06:08.620
I made an exception.

06:08.620 --> 06:11.170
Plus he's been
procrastinating putting
together a presentation.

06:11.170 --> 06:12.880
CEOs do not
procrastinate,

06:12.880 --> 06:15.040
they contemplate!

06:15.040 --> 06:16.670
So, what's out
to get me?

06:16.670 --> 06:20.250
Actually, I'm here
because I want to
be your intern.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.710
Intern?

06:21.710 --> 06:23.830
I don't need an intern,
I have my assistant!

06:23.830 --> 06:25.750
(quietly)
She only makes slightly
more than an intern.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.460
I just thought you
might be interested,

06:27.460 --> 06:30.670

06:30.670 --> 06:31.670

06:31.670 --> 06:32.620

an intern?

06:32.620 --> 06:34.830

06:34.830 --> 06:36.500
But you're not interested,
so I'm just gonna...

I need an intern.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.290

Sorry guys, I'm out.

That's okay, Hiro.
Freddy?

09:24.620 --> 09:26.830
"Patrol" is my
middle name!

09:26.830 --> 09:29.080
Well, actually, it's

Pretty close!

Loser, Loser and Associates?

09:50.880 --> 09:54.040
Actually it's at Krei Tech?
Maybe you've heard of it?

09:54.040 --> 09:56.750
Honestly, I think it's sad
you feel the need to copy me.

09:56.750 --> 09:57.960

I am not-- ugh, look.

10:17.000 --> 10:18.040
You were wrong.

10:22.710 --> 10:25.170
I can't believe
we had to pick up--

10:25.170 --> 10:26.420
Ugh! Watch where you're--

10:27.620 --> 10:29.330
Hiro?

10:29.330 --> 10:30.960
We picked up
dry cleaning.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.290
Wow, you were right,

10:32.290 --> 10:34.120
that's very
important work.

10:34.120 --> 10:35.460
Oh, uh, this?

10:35.460 --> 10:37.580
Uh, th-th-th-this
isn't for Krei, this is--

10:37.580 --> 10:40.540
You have a text from
Alistair Krei, quote:

10:40.540 --> 10:43.710
"Pick up a cappuccino
on your way back from
the dry cleaners".

10:43.710 --> 10:45.420
-End quote.
-Bad timing, Baymax.

10:48.040 --> 10:50.790
(laughs)

10:50.790 --> 10:52.250
I've gotta get back to my lab.

10:52.250 --> 10:56.250
Liv and I are working
on a super exciting
science project. Oh!

10:56.250 --> 10:58.790
I think you
dropped this.
(laughs)

11:00.040 --> 11:04.500
Fred: (singing)
They're the ultimate super duo!

11:04.500 --> 11:07.540
Makin' the city super cool-o!

11:07.540 --> 11:12.460
-It's Honey Lemon
and Fred-o!
-Honey Lemon: Shh!

11:12.460 --> 11:14.960
I know, I know,
"cool-o" and "Fred-o"
doesn't exactly rhyme--

11:14.960 --> 11:16.460
It really doesn't,
but...

11:16.460 --> 11:18.120
what I meant
was look!

11:23.830 --> 11:26.540
Picking up notes of dill.
(sniffing)

11:26.540 --> 11:28.710
Briney...(gasps)

11:28.710 --> 11:30.460
Pickle juice!

11:32.000 --> 11:35.830
Noodle Burger Boy:
(repeating)
Ow, ow, ow, ow...

11:35.830 --> 11:38.040
ow, ow, ow...

11:38.040 --> 11:41.170
ow, ow, ow, ow, Howdy!

11:41.170 --> 11:43.540
Ugh, the head spin
is so creepy, right?

11:43.540 --> 11:44.500
Relish it.

11:44.500 --> 11:46.500
Ha-ha, ha-ha-- ahh!

11:46.500 --> 11:47.580
(Honey Lemon screams)

11:49.040 --> 11:52.080
You c-can't stop me
from going home!

11:54.000 --> 11:55.880
(people screaming)

11:55.880 --> 11:58.830
-Super jump!
-Do you wanna be
fried with that?

12:02.210 --> 12:03.040
Order up.

12:06.080 --> 12:08.290
There's an evil fast-food
mascot on the loose!

12:08.290 --> 12:09.580
Again?

12:09.580 --> 12:10.790
Phase Two.

12:15.790 --> 12:17.080
(robotic laughter)

12:18.500 --> 12:20.210
(robotic laughter)

12:22.620 --> 12:23.580
(girl crying)

12:23.580 --> 12:24.790
-Ah!
-(zaps)

12:26.040 --> 12:27.040
(grunts)

12:28.330 --> 12:29.460
I've got him, H-Lemon.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.250
(zapping)

12:33.250 --> 12:35.170
(electricity crackling)

12:37.750 --> 12:39.920
Toodle-doodle!

12:39.920 --> 12:41.880
(both gasp)

12:42.960 --> 12:45.250
Krei: So I said,
"You think you're sweating?

12:45.250 --> 12:47.000
I'm dressed
as a cow!"

12:48.040 --> 12:50.250
-Anyway...
-(sips, spits)

12:50.250 --> 12:51.460
This is a cappuccino.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.540
You asked for a cappuccino.

12:53.540 --> 12:55.250
Yes, but I meant macchiato.

12:55.250 --> 12:56.790
Get your head
in the game, intern!

12:56.790 --> 12:58.330
R-right.
Sorry. Mr. Krei.

12:58.330 --> 13:00.330
Um, about that
magnet project--

13:00.330 --> 13:02.170
Nothing,
just my intern.

13:02.170 --> 13:04.290
Hello? Biscotti.

13:04.290 --> 13:06.080
What am I?
A Neanderthal?

13:06.080 --> 13:08.920
(laughs)
Moo.

13:08.920 --> 13:11.170
So that's two fries,
two orders of fries,
two large fries.

13:11.170 --> 13:13.830
Would you like fries with that?
Yes, fries-fries-fries...ahh!

13:17.620 --> 13:19.250
He's acting weird...

13:19.250 --> 13:21.120
and he was pretty
weird to start.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.000
Let's move!

13:26.580 --> 13:28.880
Noodle Burger Boy,
you're coming with us.

13:28.880 --> 13:30.120
No can do!

13:30.120 --> 13:32.120
I've got to go home!

13:32.120 --> 13:33.420
Where is home?

13:33.420 --> 13:34.380
H-hh--

13:34.380 --> 13:35.830
home...style...

13:35.830 --> 13:40.120
(repeating)
fries, fries, fries!

13:40.120 --> 13:41.920
Laser, laser, laser, laser.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.250
Oopsie, workplace injury!

13:49.290 --> 13:50.960
Oh, that's just wrong.

13:53.880 --> 13:56.830
Workplace injury!
Workplace injury!

13:56.830 --> 13:58.120
Workplace injury!

13:58.120 --> 14:02.120
Order up! I-I-I-I
have to go home.

14:06.790 --> 14:08.620
Noodle Burger Boy:
Delivery!

14:08.620 --> 14:10.330
(grunts)

14:10.330 --> 14:11.620
Gross...

14:11.620 --> 14:13.000
wait...

14:16.170 --> 14:18.750
"Home" is Krei Tech.

14:18.750 --> 14:19.540
Both:
Hiro!

14:23.830 --> 14:26.750
Hiro, you are receiving
a call from Go Go.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.380
Call her back.
This is important.

14:29.830 --> 14:31.460
What do you think,
intern, smile one...

14:33.580 --> 14:34.750
Or smile two?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.580
Smile one is more handsome,

14:37.580 --> 14:40.250
but smile two says,
"I came to play,

14:40.250 --> 14:41.380
and I don't
follow the rules."

14:41.380 --> 14:45.380
They are 99.999% identical.

14:45.380 --> 14:47.830
You didn't answer my question.
Let's try again.

14:47.830 --> 14:49.170
I can't do
this anymore!

14:49.170 --> 14:50.620
I'm sorry.

14:50.620 --> 14:53.420
You're too small to
hold such a big mirror.
Robot!

14:53.420 --> 14:55.250
Robot, what are you doing?
Come on, hold the mirror.

14:55.250 --> 14:56.920
No! I-I mean,
this internship.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.210
No more dry cleaning,
no more coffee runs,

14:59.210 --> 15:01.670
and I have so many questions
about the cow costume.

15:01.670 --> 15:03.330
So, what you're
saying is...

15:03.330 --> 15:04.620
smile two.

15:04.620 --> 15:06.250
Mm-mm.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.580
Look, I am missing
out on helping
the team find--

15:10.380 --> 15:14.500
-(explosion)
-Hello! Did somebody
order a noodle burger!

15:14.500 --> 15:17.170
No, I ordered
a cappuccino!

15:17.170 --> 15:18.920
But he meant macchiato.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.380
Honey, I'm...home!

15:23.380 --> 15:25.710
I need all the fixings!

15:25.710 --> 15:27.620
Home...?

15:27.620 --> 15:30.210
Because he's malfunctioning,
and needs to be fixed...

15:30.210 --> 15:31.330
he's come back to
where he was made!

15:31.330 --> 15:33.500
Ding ding dingty ding ding ding!

15:33.500 --> 15:35.500
But...I don't know
how to fix you!

15:35.500 --> 15:36.500
I am management.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.960
N-no problem, mister!

15:38.960 --> 15:41.380
He does, order to go!

15:41.380 --> 15:42.290
You're not going
anywhere.

15:42.290 --> 15:44.290
I'm calling
security-- ahh!

15:44.290 --> 15:46.460
(beeping)

15:46.460 --> 15:49.330
So! Where to?

15:50.580 --> 15:53.330
Bienvenido
a la Fry Works.

15:53.330 --> 15:55.710
Where the magic happens!

15:55.710 --> 15:57.120
Are you okay, Baymax?

15:57.120 --> 15:58.620
I cannot move,

15:58.620 --> 16:02.460
but I am safe and-and-and-
and surrounded by potatoes.

16:02.460 --> 16:04.670
-Fry the--
-(electricity zapping)

16:04.670 --> 16:06.790
-Fry the bun!
-(klaxon blares)

16:06.790 --> 16:07.750
Noodles.

16:07.750 --> 16:08.960
Soy sauce.

16:08.960 --> 16:09.880
Secret spices!

16:09.880 --> 16:11.460
Fryer!

16:11.460 --> 16:13.170
(grunts)

16:16.540 --> 16:17.290
Ugh!

16:17.290 --> 16:19.290
This cannot be sanitary.

16:20.670 --> 16:22.380
-(gasps)
-Noodle Burger Boy: Nope!

16:22.380 --> 16:24.040
And...nope.

16:24.040 --> 16:25.500
Ahh!

16:25.500 --> 16:26.540
You're not going
anywhere, hee hee!

16:28.290 --> 16:29.380
No, n-n-n-no!

16:32.460 --> 16:34.210
This is crazy!

16:34.210 --> 16:36.120
Noodle Burger Boy,
let Krei go,

16:36.120 --> 16:37.380
and let's just
talk about this.

16:37.380 --> 16:42.380
After you fix my burger,
I'll let that burger go!

16:43.580 --> 16:45.580
Okay, okay.
L-let me take a look.

16:45.580 --> 16:48.920
Salt water corroded
your logic circuits.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.500
(singing) Ring bell!

16:50.500 --> 16:52.880
Burger burger!
Really swell!

16:52.880 --> 16:56.040
Yeah! M-m-marry noodles...

16:56.040 --> 16:57.460
(demonic voice)
Secret sauce!

17:00.210 --> 17:01.330
(struggling)
Come...

17:01.330 --> 17:02.540
on...

17:04.880 --> 17:05.960
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.710
What did we learn?

17:08.830 --> 17:09.830
Go Go:
Hey...

17:09.830 --> 17:11.500
looks like he's
on two legs again.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.460
Do you think
Krei fixed him?

17:12.460 --> 17:14.540
No way,
he's management.

17:14.540 --> 17:17.040
-But...his intern...
-Hiro...

17:17.040 --> 17:18.580
he's in trouble!

17:18.580 --> 17:20.540
Fred: Um, guys,
I think we might be
in trouble, also?

17:20.540 --> 17:21.500
Ya think?

17:21.500 --> 17:22.960
I think.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.120
We don't have time for this.

17:26.380 --> 17:27.420
(crash)

17:29.380 --> 17:30.790
Ahh!

17:30.790 --> 17:32.040
Uh...quick question,
Trina.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.210
Did you change
your hair?

17:33.210 --> 17:34.540
Got in the way.

17:34.540 --> 17:36.460
Ah!
(groaning)

17:36.460 --> 17:37.210
Later!

17:38.330 --> 17:40.380
-Ow...
-Ah, you said it.

17:40.380 --> 17:42.880
-Me, too.
-Yeah...

17:46.460 --> 17:47.380
(groaning)

17:49.120 --> 17:51.420
Ow! I should never
have built you!

17:51.420 --> 17:53.460
I'm more of a Yaki Taco
guy anyway!

17:53.460 --> 17:55.880
Ring ring ring
ring ring ring.
(chuckles)

17:55.880 --> 17:58.380
A ring ring ring
ring ring...
(giggles)

17:58.380 --> 18:00.960
I do not understand this song.

18:03.580 --> 18:04.500
Ugh!

18:04.500 --> 18:05.750
(whimpers)

18:05.750 --> 18:07.120
Ha-ha!

18:10.880 --> 18:12.500
Come on!

18:12.500 --> 18:13.670
Ahh!

18:13.670 --> 18:15.710
I get dizzy!

18:15.710 --> 18:17.500
Hang on, Mr. Krei,
almost done.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.210
(powering up)

18:19.210 --> 18:20.210
Aw, thanks Mister!

18:20.210 --> 18:22.420
I feel really swell!

18:22.420 --> 18:24.580
I just have to reboot
you, and the fixes
will be permanent.

18:24.580 --> 18:25.750
Don't mess up
my order, mister,

18:25.750 --> 18:28.580
or your friend will be
crispy-style!

18:29.790 --> 18:32.330
Hurry up! They're
seasoning me!
A-choo!

18:32.330 --> 18:33.790
This is the last step.
I promise.

18:36.960 --> 18:38.460
Krei:
Whatever it is,

18:38.460 --> 18:39.960
do it now.

18:39.960 --> 18:41.620
(beeping, ejecting)

18:41.620 --> 18:43.040
Obake's chip.

18:43.040 --> 18:44.920
-Hands off, Hamada!
-Trina?!

18:44.920 --> 18:47.380
I gave myself
an upgrade.

18:47.380 --> 18:49.670
I just tried it out
on your friends.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.880
I've been trying to find
my little brother for days.

18:51.880 --> 18:54.330
-Guess you
found him first.
-(beeping)

18:54.330 --> 18:56.540
Uh-uh, I found him!

18:56.540 --> 18:58.210
Your little brother...

18:58.210 --> 18:59.380
okay...

18:59.380 --> 19:00.420
Really, Hamada?

19:00.420 --> 19:01.500
We're weird?

19:01.500 --> 19:03.380
You hanging out with
Mr. Hugs over there?

19:04.620 --> 19:05.420
My name is Baymax.

19:05.420 --> 19:06.750
Oh, shut it, hugs!

19:08.000 --> 19:10.540
Howdy and hello!

19:10.540 --> 19:11.670
Hi, sis!

19:11.670 --> 19:13.000
Something is different.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.380
Is it the hair?

19:14.380 --> 19:15.920
I cannot believe
we're related.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.540
Krei:
Do something, intern!

19:26.290 --> 19:27.460
Ha! Ya missed.

19:27.460 --> 19:28.540
-Did I?
-(button beeps)

19:29.620 --> 19:32.290
-Wee! Hee hee!
-Hey!

19:32.290 --> 19:34.000
This is a powerful pickle.

19:34.000 --> 19:36.420
Ultra-powerful
mini-magnet, my design.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.420
Cool...but what about me?!

19:43.420 --> 19:45.920
-Ah, no!
-I don't wanna be deep fried!

19:48.380 --> 19:49.290
-Ahh!
-Got you!

19:50.880 --> 19:52.120
Well done, intern!

19:54.330 --> 19:55.830
You...have to
call me "intern"?

19:55.830 --> 19:57.540
Well, that's your title,
isn't it?

19:57.540 --> 19:59.460
You can call me CEO.

19:59.460 --> 20:00.420
I prefer it, actually.

20:00.420 --> 20:01.710
(crash)

20:01.710 --> 20:03.580
Toodle noodle!

20:05.000 --> 20:06.620
They have escaped.

20:06.620 --> 20:08.080
If your obvious-bot is finished,

20:08.080 --> 20:10.620
how about you get me
out of here?

20:13.750 --> 20:17.120
So, I guess Trina and
Noodle Burger Boy
are now a team.

20:17.120 --> 20:19.750
(chuckles) Oh, yeah.
Classic Phase Two
super-villain team up.

20:19.750 --> 20:20.750
Phase Two?

20:20.750 --> 20:22.540
Defeating Obake was
the epic conclusion

20:22.540 --> 20:24.330
to Phase One
of the Big Heroverse.

20:24.330 --> 20:26.540
-Now--
-Uh-uh, never mind.

20:26.540 --> 20:27.620
(door opens)

20:29.460 --> 20:32.330
Oh-oh-oh, uh,
hi, uh, um...

20:32.330 --> 20:34.380
Judy...
no one ever asks.

20:34.380 --> 20:36.670
Mr. Krei's outside,
he wants to talk to you.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.380
Thank you, um...

20:39.380 --> 20:43.420
-Judy.
-(clears throat)
Really? Huh...

20:43.420 --> 20:44.460
Uh, Mr. Krei,

20:44.460 --> 20:46.790
I tricked you
into my internship.

20:46.790 --> 20:49.500
It wasn't a good idea
for me...or you.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.960
Let's forget this
ever happened?

20:53.960 --> 20:55.710
Hiro, wait.

20:55.710 --> 20:57.120
Thank you
for saving me.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.790
I'm sorry I had you
pick up my dry cleaning.

20:58.790 --> 21:00.170
That's what my
assistant is for.

21:00.170 --> 21:02.000
Okay...

21:02.000 --> 21:04.290
Your mini-magnet
was really impressive.

21:04.290 --> 21:06.790
Is there any way I
could convince you
to stay?

21:06.790 --> 21:08.250
Uh...pass.

21:08.250 --> 21:10.790
I just want to go back
to school and be
a regular student.

21:10.790 --> 21:12.920
Oh... that's tough,

21:12.920 --> 21:15.170
because you signed a contract.

21:15.170 --> 21:16.790
Mm-hm...

21:16.790 --> 21:19.250
I own you for the next year.

21:19.250 --> 21:22.790
-(door closes, window opens)
-Krei: But you're
getting your own lab.

21:22.790 --> 21:24.580
And my coffee.
Macchiato.

21:24.580 --> 21:26.210
Or do I really want
a cappuccino?

21:26.210 --> 21:29.330
Keep your phone handy,
might be a frapa-something.

21:29.330 --> 21:30.830
I'll text you.
