00:41.140 --> 00:42.272
What can I get you?

01:15.340 --> 01:19.675
Tony, can I get
a refill on that? Regular.

01:19.677 --> 01:23.613
Then we've got dark, decaf,
americano and espresso.

01:26.284 --> 01:28.585
- Piping hot.
- Thank you, sir.

01:28.587 --> 01:31.156
No, thank you, Daisy.
I don't know how you do it.

01:31.423 --> 01:33.290
It's in the air.

01:33.292 --> 01:35.128
Everybody's in the holiday
spirit, can't you feel it?

01:35.561 --> 01:37.564
Yeah, but you're
especially chipper.

01:37.829 --> 01:39.630
I know, I'm super excited.

01:39.632 --> 01:41.498
I'll be home for the first
time in two years.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.269
I saved all my money to get
my family great presents.

01:44.469 --> 01:46.371
I get to spend
the whole six weeks,

01:46.671 --> 01:48.639
all the holidays.

01:48.641 --> 01:51.111
I don't think I'm going to bed
tonight, I'll go for a run.

01:51.310 --> 01:54.511
- Stay young, kid.
- Lord knows I'm trying, Tony.

05:25.891 --> 05:27.393
No!

06:00.658 --> 06:01.824
No!

06:47.906 --> 06:50.774
- Hey, beautiful tree, guys.
- Yeah, he cut it off himself.

06:50.776 --> 06:53.579
- Yeah, I did.
- Nice job, bud.

07:04.523 --> 07:06.223
How much we owe you?
What's your name?

07:06.225 --> 07:07.927
- Rudolph.
- Like the reindeer?

07:08.726 --> 07:09.928
Yeah, I get that a lot.

07:36.021 --> 07:37.753
Smell that pine!

07:37.755 --> 07:39.691
Thanks for bringing us
up here, Cut.

07:39.891 --> 07:41.524
Yeah, breathe it in, dude.

07:41.526 --> 07:43.125
I'm going to find me
the perfect tree.

07:43.127 --> 07:44.629
Are you girls getting one?

07:44.963 --> 07:47.233
Maybe, what do you think, Margo,
do we have room?

07:47.865 --> 07:50.002
I don't know,
I'm here for the party.

07:50.269 --> 07:51.937
Yeah!

07:53.605 --> 07:55.305
Last year, Cutler and I

07:55.307 --> 07:57.009
found the cutest tree,
I knew we had to come back.

07:57.309 --> 07:58.945
You've been here before?

07:59.545 --> 08:02.045
Hell yeah, found this place on
a random road trip in college.

08:02.047 --> 08:03.583
Oh, you mean the stoner drive?

08:04.916 --> 08:06.084
That's awesome.

08:08.754 --> 08:10.219
You have to come
the first weekend

08:10.221 --> 08:12.022
or all the good trees are gone.

08:12.024 --> 08:12.891
That makes sense.

08:14.093 --> 08:17.226
Oh my god, I'm just noticing
your sweater, it's Blitzen?

08:17.228 --> 08:18.730
It's funny.

08:19.064 --> 08:21.565
Don't worry we are definitely
gonna get Blitzen.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.569
Yeah we are.

08:25.336 --> 08:27.904
- Game!
- Game!

08:27.906 --> 08:29.208
Wait, what are we doing?

08:30.776 --> 08:32.945
It's like, it's game,
it's like...

08:33.345 --> 08:35.611
It's like challenge or dare.

08:35.614 --> 08:37.783
Someone says game
and we all have to play.

08:38.049 --> 08:39.847
Like these Christmas sweaters.

08:39.850 --> 08:41.917
That's why I have to wear
this hideous thing.

08:41.919 --> 08:43.688
Aha!

08:45.222 --> 08:47.692
Let's go chop
some fucking trees!

08:52.798 --> 08:54.667
All right, what do we have here?

08:55.100 --> 08:56.134
Saws.

08:57.369 --> 08:58.671
All right.

08:58.870 --> 09:00.940
- Roberto.
- Thank you.

09:05.076 --> 09:07.647
- And, Art, this is yours.
- Thank you.

09:09.114 --> 09:10.615
Oh, yeah!

09:12.951 --> 09:13.885
God.

09:15.953 --> 09:18.223
- Babe?
- No, thank you.

09:21.293 --> 09:22.762
This place is awesome.

09:22.995 --> 09:24.861
Yeah, except there's no
cell service.

09:24.863 --> 09:26.766
You think they'll be able
to fix it by now.

09:27.298 --> 09:29.632
What's that building
across the way?

09:29.634 --> 09:32.071
Some homeless refuge, like ew.

09:33.071 --> 09:35.975
Used to be some fancy hotel,
but people stopped going there.

09:36.841 --> 09:38.711
Now, just
the occasional squatter.

09:39.845 --> 09:41.581
Wouldn't go anywhere near
if I were you.

09:42.246 --> 09:43.315
Why not?

09:44.015 --> 09:45.116
It's a real dangerous place.

09:46.851 --> 09:50.755
Yeah, well, looks pretty sick,
like a movie or something

09:51.222 --> 09:52.625
That's super creepy.

09:53.325 --> 09:55.261
I love creepy.

09:55.660 --> 09:58.697
Oh, it's real creepy,
I'd stay away if I were you.

09:59.197 --> 10:01.164
This guy is so creepy.

10:01.166 --> 10:02.968
Are we talking about
how creepy this shit it is

10:03.999 --> 10:05.401
or are we chopping down
some fucking trees?

10:05.403 --> 10:08.103
- Yeah!
- Let's do it!

10:08.105 --> 10:09.274
Where are your Colorado?

10:09.941 --> 10:11.377
Back lot, up over the hill.

10:12.043 --> 10:14.710
Truck will pick you up,
we close in an hour.

10:14.712 --> 10:15.981
Sun down, you better be ready.

10:17.149 --> 10:18.149
You got it, man.

10:19.049 --> 10:21.886
Ok, thank you, thank you.
Ok, let's do it!

10:55.986 --> 10:57.887
- How do you know Margo?
- We work together.

10:57.889 --> 10:59.759
Nice,
so you are in wardrobe too?

11:00.057 --> 11:02.791
Yeah, I mean, mostly we just
follow the designer around,

11:02.793 --> 11:06.032
take notes, grab coffee,
run errands, that sort of thing.

11:06.398 --> 11:07.899
Yeah, it is fun.

11:08.466 --> 11:09.534
How do you know these guys?

11:10.201 --> 11:12.804
I actually just found
Art and Cutler on Craigslist.

11:13.270 --> 11:15.504
They needed a roommate
I just moved out here,

11:15.506 --> 11:16.839
Thing just kind of...

11:16.841 --> 11:18.241
You know, worked out well.

11:18.243 --> 11:20.008
- From where?
- Iowa.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.777
I'm from New Mexico.

11:21.779 --> 11:24.216
- Oh, wow, long way from home.
- Yeah, it is.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.348
But I really like it here,

11:26.350 --> 11:28.187
I mean,
there's so much more going on.

11:29.019 --> 11:29.989
Fair enough.

11:32.791 --> 11:34.694
- Game.
- What are we playing?

11:35.894 --> 11:37.697
Greens for the greenery.

11:39.096 --> 11:40.399
I'm one with the trees.

11:40.966 --> 11:42.967
- Margo, you know I don't...
- Really?

11:43.301 --> 11:45.071
It's like not that hardcore.

11:45.370 --> 11:47.807
- I mean, have you ever even?
- Yes, I have.

11:50.808 --> 11:51.876
Whatever, let's play.

11:55.013 --> 11:57.850
Yo, let's get out of the path.

11:58.283 --> 11:59.250
Good call.

12:04.822 --> 12:07.492
Is that guy always so fucking
agreeable and cheery?

12:07.926 --> 12:10.126
Come on, it's better
than being an asshole.

12:10.128 --> 12:12.131
Robbie is a good dude,
ain't nothing wrong.

12:12.496 --> 12:13.732
I think he's sweet.

12:13.965 --> 12:16.735
Well, fuck you, guys.

12:24.509 --> 12:26.408
Ok, just ignore her,
she's just...

12:26.410 --> 12:27.211
Being a bitch.

12:27.979 --> 12:31.079
No, that was not
what I was going to say.

12:31.081 --> 12:32.451
But it's the same thing.

12:33.250 --> 12:35.086
It's cool, guys,
doesn't bother me.

13:00.611 --> 13:01.947
That's how you do it.

13:02.379 --> 13:03.448
Bella, catch.

13:08.886 --> 13:10.855
- Why not, right?
- There you go, Kate.

13:17.863 --> 13:18.962
Take it all in, baby.

13:18.964 --> 13:20.296
Game, game.

13:20.298 --> 13:21.500
Game!

13:21.966 --> 13:23.101
Frolic.

13:24.568 --> 13:26.104
Sounds naughty.

13:26.403 --> 13:29.040
So pair up, go into the forest,

13:29.341 --> 13:31.543
and do ever your dirty
little mind's desire.

13:32.009 --> 13:33.846
I've got Cutler, obviously.

13:34.312 --> 13:35.447
Obviously.

13:37.883 --> 13:38.918
Okay.

13:39.517 --> 13:42.855
Well, we have already played,
so...

13:44.255 --> 13:45.423
Let's go newbies.

13:45.624 --> 13:46.859
Okay.

13:47.893 --> 13:48.827
Margo.

13:53.631 --> 13:57.065
So, I didn't really know we were
taking on when I signed up.

13:57.067 --> 13:59.035
It's cool, don't worry.

13:59.037 --> 14:00.940
We don't have to do anything,
I'm down to just chill.

14:01.139 --> 14:02.508
Awesome, okay.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.511
Or we could keep drinking.

14:06.344 --> 14:08.344
I think I'm going
to take a pass.

14:08.346 --> 14:10.481
I'm already feeling
pretty light-headed.

14:11.216 --> 14:12.951
Do you? No worries.

14:14.586 --> 14:18.087
You know, I think most of these
games are stupid anyway.

14:18.089 --> 14:21.360
What's the point of frolic
when Cutler always gets Bella?

14:21.927 --> 14:24.028
We're not spinning
a bottle or anything random.

14:25.096 --> 14:27.600
- So you're into Bella?
- I mean...

14:28.133 --> 14:30.369
We had a thing once in college,
but like...

14:30.936 --> 14:33.339
she wasn't feeling me.

14:34.371 --> 14:37.008
She was more into Cutler.

14:38.509 --> 14:41.045
And that doesn't make things
awkward between you guys?

14:42.379 --> 14:43.883
Those two do whatever they want.

14:44.716 --> 14:46.918
They don't give a fuck, so...

14:51.456 --> 14:53.325
You know, screw it,
give me that.

14:57.995 --> 14:59.430
That's a stiff drink.

15:04.269 --> 15:07.206
So, what do you say
if we play that game after all?

15:09.740 --> 15:11.076
Let's play.

15:21.318 --> 15:24.353
- I fucking love Christmas.
- Fuck you, you should love me.

15:24.355 --> 15:27.022
Of course I do,
but I get my fat Christmas bonus

15:27.024 --> 15:28.961
so I'm buying some shiny rocks
for my arm candy.

15:29.494 --> 15:30.930
Asshole.

15:31.196 --> 15:33.599
- The shiniest rocks.
- They better be.

15:35.466 --> 15:39.004
Now let's go find
the perfect Christmas tree.

15:39.537 --> 15:40.439
Let's go.

15:50.181 --> 15:51.115
Margo!

16:02.027 --> 16:04.093
Hey!

16:04.095 --> 16:05.328
Looks like you had fun.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.032
Oh, yeah, that was fun.

16:07.231 --> 16:09.100
- Like your games, Bella.
- Thank you.

16:10.100 --> 16:11.300
Where are Kate and Art?

16:11.302 --> 16:12.768
Fucking weirdo probably told her

16:12.770 --> 16:14.771
he loves her,
she probably ran off.

16:14.773 --> 16:16.240
Ok, that's mean.

16:19.410 --> 16:20.645
Oh, look, there they are.

16:34.826 --> 16:36.295
Having fun?

16:39.197 --> 16:41.196
Yeah, Art was telling me
some stories

16:41.198 --> 16:42.668
from your college glory days.

16:43.067 --> 16:44.502
Oh, yeah, which ones?

16:45.336 --> 16:46.238
All of them.

16:47.205 --> 16:49.208
Wow, and she didn't run away?

16:49.740 --> 16:51.143
That bodes well.

16:53.378 --> 16:55.143
Guys, it's getting dark.

16:55.145 --> 16:56.548
Let's chop some trees down
before it closes.

16:57.615 --> 16:58.649
Right!

17:14.464 --> 17:16.200
Is that all? No trees?

17:17.434 --> 17:19.568
I couldn't found
those brats anywhere.

17:19.569 --> 17:22.374
We drove the path, hit the back
lot, and all the side areas.

17:23.674 --> 17:26.345
Fuck man, there's the SUV
they're still around here.

17:26.778 --> 17:29.647
The old lady is cooking up
a stew, I gotta get out of here.

17:30.147 --> 17:32.683
Fuck, I'm not waiting around
for those little shits.

17:34.285 --> 17:35.487
Screw this shit!

17:37.521 --> 17:38.888
Fuck.

17:38.890 --> 17:40.722
- You got this, Ruddy?
- Yeah, I got it.

17:40.724 --> 17:43.394
Just do another lap here,
you don't find them, fuck them.

17:43.728 --> 17:46.131
- I'm getting out of here.
- Give me a ride to the bus.

17:46.530 --> 17:49.233
- Hey, can I get a ride too?
- Hop on.

17:51.669 --> 17:53.272
I got it, don't worry about it.

17:54.271 --> 17:55.573
Have a nice fucking evening.

17:56.473 --> 17:59.243
- Take it easy, Rud.
- Yeah, you too, buddy.

17:59.911 --> 18:01.279
Fucking assholes.

18:04.749 --> 18:06.852
Fuck these kids, dude.

18:15.160 --> 18:16.595
Fuck out of here, I'm leaving.

18:19.530 --> 18:22.166
Oh, Christmas tree.

18:24.868 --> 18:26.270
Cutler!

18:27.471 --> 18:29.540
- What's up?
- I love it.

18:30.340 --> 18:31.442
So I can leave this one?

18:31.808 --> 18:34.212
Yeah,

18:34.679 --> 18:36.181
I love when you talk shit.

18:37.481 --> 18:41.119
Yeah, fuck the Colorado,
let's get this, we are set.

18:41.752 --> 18:42.887
You got it, babe.

18:47.458 --> 18:48.660
Where is everyone?

18:55.299 --> 18:56.401
So pretty.

18:57.367 --> 18:59.337
- You two are not getting a tree?
- No.

18:59.737 --> 19:03.706
- No, our apartment is too small.
- Yeah, we live in a shoebox.

19:03.708 --> 19:06.278
My room is literally the size
of the walking closet.

19:07.778 --> 19:08.747
Timber!

19:11.915 --> 19:14.685
- There you guys are.
- Hey, you guys see that truck?

19:15.420 --> 19:16.488
- No.
- No.

19:17.555 --> 19:20.323
Need any help with that, Cutler?
I'm a good helper.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.626
I'm good, thanks though.

19:23.428 --> 19:24.796
Looks like everything's
shut down.

19:25.596 --> 19:26.962
Damn, we missed it.

19:26.964 --> 19:28.232
Free trees, bitches.

19:29.567 --> 19:30.865
It'll be a bitch
trying to strap these on.

19:30.867 --> 19:32.837
I think I got rope in my bag.

19:33.238 --> 19:34.806
You always figure it out, babe.

19:35.839 --> 19:37.275
Look at the stars!

19:50.688 --> 19:52.224
We're playing a different game.

19:53.590 --> 19:56.327
- All right, moving along.
- My bad.

19:56.994 --> 19:58.629
Have you ever been inside?

20:00.298 --> 20:01.730
That hotel over there.

20:01.732 --> 20:04.836
Deck the halls.

20:05.435 --> 20:07.705
Oh, no, not for me.

20:08.538 --> 20:09.775
I'd go.

20:10.008 --> 20:11.843
I'd go and see what kind
of shit is in there.

20:12.343 --> 20:13.409
Yeah.

20:13.411 --> 20:15.811
Wow, looks great, guys.

20:15.813 --> 20:17.646
Thanks.

20:17.648 --> 20:19.650
Ladies and gentlemen,
this calls for a celebration.

20:20.384 --> 20:22.688
- Game?
- Game!

20:23.721 --> 20:24.589
How about a new game?

20:25.957 --> 20:27.492
I don't know if you will.

20:27.825 --> 20:28.826
Call it, kid.

20:29.661 --> 20:30.662
Exploration.

20:31.628 --> 20:32.997
We're going to the hotel.

20:36.933 --> 20:38.401
- Yes.
- Nice.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.271
I'm not playing that game.

20:40.837 --> 20:42.907
You have to play,
that's how game works.

20:43.607 --> 20:45.074
- No.
- Come on, Bella, it'll be fun.

20:45.076 --> 20:46.778
It'll be so spooky.

20:47.311 --> 20:48.879
You're not actually scared,
are you?

20:50.781 --> 20:51.916
Bella.

20:54.885 --> 20:59.290
I... you better stay beside me
the entire fucking time.

21:01.592 --> 21:03.959
Babe, don't worry,
I'll protect you, I promise.

21:03.961 --> 21:07.298
Look, in fact, I think mom
got some lights in the back.

21:09.067 --> 21:10.434
Great.

21:18.776 --> 21:20.843
Boom, check it out.

21:20.845 --> 21:22.478
Always prepared.

21:22.480 --> 21:23.778
Yeah, aren't you?

21:23.780 --> 21:25.347
Actually,
I bought some flashlights

21:25.349 --> 21:26.716
since were up in the boonies.

21:26.718 --> 21:28.616
- Look at you.
- On top of it.

21:28.618 --> 21:30.422
These are
quick up there, right?

21:31.455 --> 21:34.623
Ok, guys, now this is a party.

21:34.625 --> 21:36.327
Yeah!

21:41.665 --> 21:42.600
Wow.

21:48.873 --> 21:50.075
Here we go.

21:52.009 --> 21:54.313
Oh my god, this is so exciting.

21:54.846 --> 21:57.548
I don't know, it is literally
in the middle of nowhere.

21:57.848 --> 21:59.681
This is not
the middle of nowhere.

21:59.683 --> 22:02.386
- You should go to New Mexico.
- Or Iowa.

22:02.720 --> 22:03.689
I drink to that.

22:05.757 --> 22:07.859
Hey, don't worry,
you'll be fine, Bella.

22:08.992 --> 22:10.528
There's a clearing over there.

22:10.961 --> 22:12.364
Come on, let's go.

22:18.169 --> 22:21.403
Ah, this place is so scary,
I love it.

22:21.405 --> 22:23.939
So sick, I wonder how many
bodies are in there.

22:23.941 --> 22:24.942
That's not funny.

22:26.144 --> 22:27.977
I think four, what do you think?

22:27.979 --> 22:29.514
I think maybe at least ten.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.515
You guys suck.

22:32.650 --> 22:34.083
They're just kidding,
there are no bodies in there.

22:34.085 --> 22:36.121
- I bet there's one body.
- Cutler!

22:36.953 --> 22:39.521
Hey, you think we can just walk

22:39.523 --> 22:40.791
straight through
that front door?

22:41.125 --> 22:42.693
I don't know,
looks pretty boarded up.

22:43.027 --> 22:44.429
We could probably open it.

22:44.729 --> 22:46.431
Onward, hoe.

22:48.199 --> 22:49.668
Who are you calling a hoe?

22:50.601 --> 22:53.572
- Oh, I just...
- I'm just fucking with you.

22:54.605 --> 22:56.040
Why are you being such a dick?

22:56.740 --> 22:59.144
Not being a dick,
just having some fun.

23:12.490 --> 23:14.726
Deck the halls.

23:37.515 --> 23:38.717
Oh, fuck.

23:41.751 --> 23:44.588
Looks like they're definitely
trying to keep people out.

23:45.623 --> 23:48.058
So, how do we get in?

24:05.009 --> 24:07.179
It's like one of those
urban explore things.

24:08.211 --> 24:11.081
Let's look for loose boards
or nails that we can pull out.

24:11.582 --> 24:12.717
This isn't a good idea.

24:15.185 --> 24:17.455
- Thanks.
- Are you having fun?

24:17.821 --> 24:19.757
Oh, my God, yes,
I'm having tons of fun.

24:19.990 --> 24:21.759
I haven't let loose
like this in...

24:22.559 --> 24:23.727
maybe ever.

24:24.127 --> 24:25.995
You know your friends
are completely insane.

24:25.997 --> 24:27.798
I mean, these games are crazy.

24:28.065 --> 24:28.933
They get crazier.

24:29.133 --> 24:30.900
Wait, crazier than this?

24:30.902 --> 24:32.770
Yeah, they love
to fuck with people's heads.

24:39.042 --> 24:40.678
Come on,
let's go around the side.

24:43.047 --> 24:44.516
Look at this place.

24:48.853 --> 24:50.251
They are assholes.

24:50.253 --> 24:51.786
Hey, why are you being
so uptight?

24:51.788 --> 24:53.555
I'm not being uptight, Margo.

24:53.557 --> 24:55.824
I don't want to be here,
this place creeps me out.

24:55.826 --> 24:57.793
Yeah, that's why
it's so fun, Bella.

24:57.795 --> 24:59.631
Come on, stop being so paranoid.

24:59.931 --> 25:02.234
- So we didn't find any-
- Oh, shit!

25:02.633 --> 25:03.699
Sorry.

25:03.701 --> 25:05.871
Jesus, it's not funny.

25:06.202 --> 25:07.771
I'm so, so sorry.

25:08.138 --> 25:09.974
You should've seen
the look on your face.

25:10.207 --> 25:11.873
I hate you.

25:11.875 --> 25:14.176
No you don't, you don't hate me,
you love me.

25:14.178 --> 25:16.578
You love me, that's why
you wear that ugly sweater.

25:16.580 --> 25:19.748
- Your games are stupid.
- My games are fun and funky, ok?

25:19.750 --> 25:22.051
Who doesn't like
wearing festive sweaters?

25:22.053 --> 25:24.687
Girls, I hate to ruin your
little menstruation session,

25:24.689 --> 25:27.792
but we're not finding any way
in here so we gotta go round.

25:28.092 --> 25:31.360
Can we get the hell out of here?
This isn't fun.

25:31.362 --> 25:32.864
Stop being such a baby.

25:33.096 --> 25:34.598
Fuck you, Art!

25:34.932 --> 25:36.601
You're gonna
speak to me like that?

25:36.968 --> 25:38.269
Guys, come on, chill out.

25:38.868 --> 25:42.173
Geez, sorry, everyone, let's go.

25:42.606 --> 25:44.974
Whatever Bella wants,
come on, game over.

25:44.976 --> 25:46.678
Whatever, Art.

25:56.086 --> 25:57.288
Babe, I got you, ok?

25:57.721 --> 25:59.220
So that's how you treat me now?

25:59.222 --> 26:01.390
Why don't you just
calm the fuck down?

26:01.392 --> 26:03.392
Don't talk to me like that.

26:03.394 --> 26:05.294
- I'm just...
- I don't like this game.

26:05.296 --> 26:07.729
I don't like all the games
you play either.

26:07.731 --> 26:09.832
That's how this shit works,
you know this.

26:09.834 --> 26:11.933
This place just freaks me
the fuck out.

26:11.935 --> 26:13.737
That's the point, isn't it?

26:15.105 --> 26:16.207
Come on, let's just go.

26:27.117 --> 26:29.620
I bet there's someone in here.

26:30.320 --> 26:31.687
Yeah and he's going
to come after you,

26:31.689 --> 26:33.721
it'll be like freak vs. weirdo.

26:33.723 --> 26:34.792
Which one is Art?

26:36.894 --> 26:39.631
That farmer said
there's the occasional squatter.

26:41.298 --> 26:42.930
Oh my God, imagine,

26:42.932 --> 26:44.333
we could get
two of them to fight

26:44.335 --> 26:45.903
and then live stream it.

26:46.703 --> 26:48.205
We are out of service up here.

26:48.405 --> 26:51.172
No, no, no, wait, we can make
them fight until they're dead

26:51.174 --> 26:52.807
and then we can hang them
on the bridge

26:52.809 --> 26:55.209
and wait for birds to eat them.

26:55.211 --> 26:57.211
Ok, Margo,
this place is scary enough.

26:57.213 --> 27:00.882
I mean, I'm down,
I'd crush a hobo, let's do it.

27:00.884 --> 27:03.788
You guys are fucked, like,
seriously fucked in the head.

27:04.821 --> 27:07.625
You don't really think there's
a squatter there, do you?

27:08.125 --> 27:10.894
I don't know, only way
to find out is if we go in.

27:13.064 --> 27:14.099
Let's go.

27:15.833 --> 27:18.132
Let's look for a thick piece
of wood or a branch

27:18.134 --> 27:19.336
and we can pry this off.

27:20.237 --> 27:21.373
So smart.

27:22.138 --> 27:23.375
All brains that guy.

27:23.773 --> 27:25.109
Don't forget the looks
and muscle.

27:25.476 --> 27:27.278
I'm the total package over here.

27:28.179 --> 27:30.045
Ok, total package,

27:30.047 --> 27:31.783
why don't you find us
a way to get in?

27:33.951 --> 27:34.986
Hey, guys!

27:36.287 --> 27:37.355
Think I found a way in.

27:37.755 --> 27:40.158
Nice find, man!

27:43.193 --> 27:44.759
Here we go.

27:44.761 --> 27:45.797
This is stupid

27:47.097 --> 27:49.667
Come on,
just get used to it.

28:09.086 --> 28:10.355
Holy shit!

28:11.221 --> 28:12.824
What the fuck happened here?

28:14.258 --> 28:16.161
Oh, shit.

28:24.868 --> 28:27.038
Oh my fucking god.

28:30.406 --> 28:32.076
Oh my god it's an oven.

28:33.309 --> 28:34.712
Stop.

28:36.346 --> 28:38.215
Oh my god,
look at this place.

28:40.884 --> 28:42.487
Guys, this is so stupid.

28:45.923 --> 28:48.023
Stop, stop, this is such
a bad idea.

28:48.025 --> 28:50.228
Bella, relax, come on,
it's not that bad.

28:51.127 --> 28:53.197
- It's that bad.
- Really?

28:53.497 --> 28:55.296
Yes, we need to get out.

28:55.298 --> 28:57.431
Looks like someone did
a real number in here.

28:57.433 --> 28:59.104
Where's the fucking hobo?

29:00.538 --> 29:01.969
Hello?

29:01.971 --> 29:03.340
Hello?

29:03.807 --> 29:04.843
Anybody home?

29:06.309 --> 29:09.079
Oh my god, there's a ball room
in here!

29:09.547 --> 29:10.949
Onward, hoe!

29:15.553 --> 29:17.155
Got another bottle?

29:17.421 --> 29:18.789
I got you.

29:20.290 --> 29:21.392
Let's do it.

29:25.162 --> 29:27.097
You are coming or what?

29:34.238 --> 29:35.240
Oh my god.

29:36.207 --> 29:37.905
Great game, Art.

29:37.907 --> 29:39.810
Yeah, great
fucking good, Art.

29:41.545 --> 29:42.980
Now that I think of it,

29:43.279 --> 29:45.048
you haven't said anything

29:45.382 --> 29:48.150
Wait, I thought we were playing
find the hobo.

29:48.152 --> 29:50.121
I'm always playing
find the hobo.

29:50.386 --> 29:51.853
Wait, what? Why?

29:51.855 --> 29:53.290
I want to play a new game.

29:53.990 --> 29:55.160
So, don't want to play frolic?

29:55.625 --> 29:57.162
The kid's horny as fuck.

29:57.461 --> 29:59.998
Uhm... how about...

30:01.632 --> 30:02.965
hide and seek?

30:02.967 --> 30:04.402
Yes, I love that game!

30:04.634 --> 30:06.837
Throwback, I like it.

30:08.972 --> 30:10.074
All right, kid.

30:11.075 --> 30:12.576
You called it, you're up.

30:13.042 --> 30:15.445
Go somewhere and count
I don't know, like a 100 or so.

30:17.381 --> 30:18.283
Let's go.

30:18.582 --> 30:19.951
One...

30:21.484 --> 30:23.288
Close your eyes, no cheating.

30:23.586 --> 30:27.125
Two... three... four...

30:28.291 --> 30:29.827
five.

30:30.059 --> 30:32.329
Tis the season to be jolly.

31:01.592 --> 31:03.027
Game on, bitches.

31:05.395 --> 31:06.330
Stop.

31:07.030 --> 31:08.529
Oh, this place is fucking dope.

31:08.531 --> 31:10.431
It's creepy as shit.

31:10.433 --> 31:12.267
We don't even know
the half of it.

31:12.269 --> 31:14.335
Looks like
it's been abandoned forever.

31:14.337 --> 31:17.107
Looks like homeless people
took a shit here, disgusting.

31:17.307 --> 31:18.475
Oh, man.

31:20.711 --> 31:23.213
Look at the graffiti
on the walls.

31:23.547 --> 31:25.212
I just want to get out of here.

31:25.214 --> 31:27.084
Babe, just relax, it's fine.

31:30.721 --> 31:32.155
I'm going upstairs.

31:32.722 --> 31:34.591
- No.
- This will calm the nerves.

31:35.291 --> 31:37.327
I'm not really in the mood,
Cutler.

31:37.594 --> 31:39.393
They don't like how you let Art
push you around,

31:39.395 --> 31:41.199
you're supposed to be the alpha.

31:41.565 --> 31:43.634
Art doesn't push shit,
all right?

31:44.034 --> 31:46.304
I've been dying to come
since we found this place.

31:47.237 --> 31:49.171
And you're right, I'm the alpha.

31:49.173 --> 31:51.910
Yeah, well, you're acting
like a fucking lap dog.

31:52.276 --> 31:53.976
Really, Bella?

31:53.978 --> 31:55.509
And who the fuck is this new
fucking tweep?

31:55.511 --> 31:57.179
What the fuck is his deal?

31:57.181 --> 31:58.615
Why do you always
have to be such a...

32:02.051 --> 32:04.021
- Robbie is fine.
- Are we fine?

32:05.122 --> 32:06.291
Of course we're fine.

32:06.757 --> 32:08.026
We're fucking perfect.

32:08.726 --> 32:09.928
You're my <i>número uno.</i>

32:12.462 --> 32:16.934
Well, doesn't feel that way...
and I'm not going upstairs.

32:18.201 --> 32:19.503
Then you can roll solo.

32:20.037 --> 32:21.940
Because nobody pushes me around.

32:22.405 --> 32:23.173
Nobody.

32:27.243 --> 32:29.678
Are you fucking serious?

32:29.680 --> 32:31.983
God dammit, Cutler.

32:42.625 --> 32:44.127
What an asshole.

32:53.303 --> 32:54.305
Let's go down here.

32:56.173 --> 32:57.474
Are you even listening?

33:00.309 --> 33:02.713
I am, I just think
you need to let go.

33:03.180 --> 33:04.749
Have a little fun.

33:19.730 --> 33:21.265
Cutler, don't!

33:22.766 --> 33:24.535
- Don't.
- Wow.

33:25.201 --> 33:26.537
Look at this place.

33:26.804 --> 33:29.107
Fucking disgusting.

33:36.846 --> 33:38.615
Stop, Cutler.

33:40.349 --> 33:41.682
Oh my god

33:41.684 --> 33:44.318
Oh my god, lighten up, Bella.

33:44.320 --> 33:46.289
This is so stupid, Cutler.

33:46.690 --> 33:48.355
Get the fuck out of here.

33:48.357 --> 33:50.161
Bella, relax.

33:51.194 --> 33:52.362
People fucked in these rooms.

34:00.570 --> 34:02.105
Oh, man.

34:11.514 --> 34:14.217
You know, I hope I find Robbie
somewhere in a dark corner.

34:14.585 --> 34:17.418
I'm going to make that boy
blush so hard.

34:17.420 --> 34:19.454
Aren't you seeing
that guy from work?

34:19.456 --> 34:21.759
Yeah, but come on,
Kate it's nothing serious.

34:22.326 --> 34:24.527
Robbie is so cute,
he's like a little puppy dog.

34:25.496 --> 34:27.695
Better hope he finds you
and not the hobo.

34:27.697 --> 34:29.231
God, imagine.

34:29.233 --> 34:30.565
Yeah, but seriously,

34:30.567 --> 34:32.199
how fucked up would it be

34:32.202 --> 34:33.337
if there really was
a hobo in here?

34:33.737 --> 34:35.570
Watching us from the shadows.

34:35.572 --> 34:37.641
He'd be pissed that we've been
creeping around.

34:38.574 --> 34:41.141
Unless I made him blush too.

34:41.143 --> 34:43.514
Margo, you are not hooking up
with a hobo tonight.

34:44.514 --> 34:46.679
Sorry, it's just something
about this place

34:46.681 --> 34:49.119
- that just makes me feel so...
- Horny?

34:49.920 --> 34:51.786
And I thought my head was off.

34:51.788 --> 34:53.356
Who said that it wasn't, huh?

34:57.760 --> 35:01.398
Oh my god, look at these stairs!

35:01.731 --> 35:04.434
Oh my god, I'm going to go
to the top floor!

35:06.302 --> 35:08.172
If you see Robbie, send him up.

35:10.940 --> 35:12.275
God.

35:14.945 --> 35:16.814
How do this place make you feel?

35:18.815 --> 35:21.686
I feel on edge, but...

35:22.619 --> 35:25.890
in a good way, you know?
I want to keep going.

35:27.523 --> 35:28.458
Shall we?

35:29.726 --> 35:31.262
Game on.

35:31.695 --> 35:34.465
Game... come on, let's not
give away our positions.

35:35.298 --> 35:36.300
Let's go upstairs.

35:44.541 --> 35:46.309
- Ladies first.
- Thank you.

35:51.949 --> 35:54.519
Ninety seven, ninety eight,

35:55.485 --> 35:56.487
Ninety nine.

35:58.322 --> 35:59.356
One hundred.

36:38.762 --> 36:39.697
Game on.

37:10.760 --> 37:12.730
Come out, come out
wherever you are!

37:14.530 --> 37:15.900
I'm not going to hurt you.

37:50.467 --> 37:51.434
Brilliant.

37:56.072 --> 37:57.275
This place.

38:06.382 --> 38:07.451
Fucking cool.

38:18.494 --> 38:19.563
This floor?

38:20.063 --> 38:21.465
No, let's keep going.

38:32.641 --> 38:34.544
Never seen anything
like this before.

38:35.411 --> 38:37.912
Don't they have like creepy
caves in New Mexico?

38:37.914 --> 38:40.914
Wouldn't know, my friends back
home are not out of their minds

38:40.916 --> 38:42.786
like you guys
with all these games.

38:43.686 --> 38:44.755
We're pretty wild.

38:45.822 --> 38:48.858
I mean, between that, this,

38:49.458 --> 38:51.992
and the booze, I feel like
a completely different person.

38:51.994 --> 38:53.931
- This floor?
- Ah...

38:54.764 --> 38:56.666
One more.

38:56.900 --> 38:59.537
Cool, I'm going to jump off here
and make things interesting.

39:00.503 --> 39:01.806
I'll catch up with you later?

39:04.039 --> 39:05.809
- You bet.
- See you.

39:19.889 --> 39:21.025
Perfect.

39:35.739 --> 39:36.874
Oh my god.

39:42.778 --> 39:43.981
Hey, Kate.

39:45.481 --> 39:46.550
Oh, hey, friend.

39:47.217 --> 39:48.686
This place is so crazy.

39:49.719 --> 39:51.853
I know, it's like
out of a nightmare.

39:51.855 --> 39:54.525
I know, I wonder what's taking
Robbie so long.

39:54.791 --> 39:57.191
You do know he's never
going to find you, right?

39:57.193 --> 39:58.827
This place is huge.

39:58.829 --> 40:00.564
Yeah, you have a point.

40:00.831 --> 40:03.231
You'd probably go and start
looking for him.

40:03.233 --> 40:06.971
I think I'm going to explore
more on my own first.

40:07.536 --> 40:09.739
- All right, have fun.
- You too.

40:58.655 --> 41:00.921
You better buy me
the nicest Christmas present

41:00.923 --> 41:02.523
for putting me through this.

41:02.525 --> 41:03.726
Oh, nothing but the best.

41:03.994 --> 41:06.963
Cutler, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop.

41:07.731 --> 41:09.533
- God.
- Oh, baby, let's go in here.

41:12.568 --> 41:14.170
The fucking death room?

41:16.273 --> 41:19.477
Let's get the hell out of here,
Cutler, it's so creepy.

41:20.976 --> 41:23.711
- Oh my god.
- Look at all these TVs.

41:23.713 --> 41:25.816
I don't care,
we need to go, please.

42:03.920 --> 42:05.956
I'd hate to have to clean
this place up.

42:06.690 --> 42:07.791
What a dump.

42:17.733 --> 42:19.737
What the fu...

43:28.672 --> 43:29.639
Oh my god!

43:33.710 --> 43:36.780
Oh my fucking god,
oh my god, are you all right?

43:39.849 --> 43:40.818
Oh my god.

43:42.152 --> 43:44.355
Help, somebody help!

43:44.920 --> 43:45.955
Oh my god!

43:46.255 --> 43:48.891
Cutler! Art!

43:50.326 --> 43:52.996
I'm going to help you!
Bella, Bella!

43:54.164 --> 43:55.132
I promise.

43:58.434 --> 43:59.702
Margo?

44:25.829 --> 44:26.797
Margo?

44:36.438 --> 44:38.139
Hey, babe,

44:38.141 --> 44:39.407
how about a dirty movie to get
the party going?

44:39.409 --> 44:42.275
Of course not.

44:42.277 --> 44:45.014
Can you imagine this place
during its heyday?

44:45.215 --> 44:46.347
Ew.

44:47.884 --> 44:49.349
- What was that?
- What the fuck?

44:49.351 --> 44:50.219
Did you hear that?

44:50.420 --> 44:52.056
I think that was Margo.

44:52.255 --> 44:55.025
- Where does it come from?
- I don't know, upstairs?

44:55.224 --> 44:57.157
That's not good.

44:57.159 --> 44:59.730
Cutler, let's just get the fuck
out of here.

45:00.496 --> 45:03.232
- Holy fuck!
- Oh my god!

45:06.268 --> 45:09.238
OK, all right, Art,
you're funny.

45:09.938 --> 45:10.907
What the fuck?

45:13.342 --> 45:14.711
Robbie?

45:16.813 --> 45:19.182
Okay, you got us.

45:21.416 --> 45:22.853
Oh my god!

45:49.579 --> 45:53.350
Bella, Bella, Bella, Bella!

45:55.851 --> 45:58.820
I'm losing you, I gotta go
and find... I'm so sorry.

45:58.822 --> 46:02.155
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry,
I will come back for you.

46:02.157 --> 46:03.493
I promise, I promise.

46:04.327 --> 46:07.397
I promise I will come back
for you, I'm so sorry.

46:15.304 --> 46:18.107
Stop, stop!

46:52.242 --> 46:53.110
My god.

46:55.378 --> 46:56.313
Are you okay?

46:57.045 --> 46:58.512
Did you hear Bella scream?

46:58.514 --> 46:59.981
Yeah, I heard a couple.

46:59.983 --> 47:01.382
I thought
I heard you scream, too.

47:01.384 --> 47:04.188
There's a girl upstairs,
she's chained to the bed.

47:05.588 --> 47:06.621
Is this another game?

47:06.623 --> 47:08.488
No, no, no, no!

47:08.490 --> 47:10.490
There's a girl upstairs,
she's chained, her throat slit

47:10.492 --> 47:12.261
and she said there's somebody
in here!

47:13.195 --> 47:15.396
Ok, in that case,
we have to go and find her.

47:15.398 --> 47:18.335
No, no, no, we need to go
find Bella, she was screaming.

47:18.601 --> 47:20.137
Bella is with Cutler,

47:20.436 --> 47:23.006
and to be honest, she's kind of
sensitive anyway.

47:23.472 --> 47:27.141
Look, if there's a girl upstairs
we have to get her.

47:27.143 --> 47:30.313
No, we need to go
and find Bella!

47:30.512 --> 47:32.179
I'm going up, you do you.

47:32.181 --> 47:34.351
No, fuck you,
we need to find Bella!

47:36.351 --> 47:37.353
Oh, fuck!

47:41.324 --> 47:42.358
Bella?

47:42.557 --> 47:43.626
What is happening?

47:44.628 --> 47:48.030
Oh, God, please don't
let this be happening.

47:50.132 --> 47:52.333
I should've
never left New Mexico.

47:52.335 --> 47:53.336
Oh my god!

47:55.605 --> 47:57.007
Who's there?

47:58.974 --> 48:00.206
Kate?

48:00.208 --> 48:02.578
Oh my god, Art, it's you!

48:05.481 --> 48:07.384
I'm scared,
did you hear those screams?

48:07.650 --> 48:09.086
I don't know
where they come from.

48:11.387 --> 48:13.523
There is a killer fucking hobo
right here.

48:13.722 --> 48:15.322
There's somebody living here,

48:15.324 --> 48:18.094
I saw cans of open
fresh food in the kitchen.

48:18.460 --> 48:19.428
That's fucked.

48:21.563 --> 48:25.067
We have to find Margo and Bella
and make sure everyone's ok.

48:25.534 --> 48:26.536
I got it, all right?

48:29.371 --> 48:31.107
They're not gonna fuck
with us, all right?

48:31.474 --> 48:32.609
Okay.

48:33.476 --> 48:35.178
- Come on.
- Ok.

48:42.117 --> 48:43.186
Which way is the girl?

48:44.519 --> 48:45.521
She's down there.

49:01.336 --> 49:02.306
Wait, wait.

49:03.505 --> 49:04.708
That room there.

49:14.717 --> 49:16.052
Holy shit.

49:20.155 --> 49:22.358
Wait, no, this isn't the room.

49:23.025 --> 49:25.559
Are you seeing this?

49:25.561 --> 49:28.231
There's something seriously
fucked up here.

49:29.032 --> 49:30.334
Who draw this shit?

49:31.768 --> 49:34.467
The girl that was chained
to the bed

49:34.469 --> 49:36.172
said that there was
somebody here.

49:38.708 --> 49:40.143
That's another one
of your games.

49:41.543 --> 49:44.213
Who the fuck would make
something like this up?

49:45.414 --> 49:47.016
Know what, Robbie?
I'm done with you.

49:49.418 --> 49:51.320
Look, you can't leave me.

49:51.721 --> 49:53.787
Why not? You obviously
don't believe me.

49:53.789 --> 49:55.324
Just in case this is real.

49:56.125 --> 49:59.459
Who would make up
something like this?

49:59.461 --> 50:02.331
All I'm saying is between all
this stuff, my mind is a haze.

50:05.068 --> 50:07.137
- We need to find that girl.
- Wait.

50:08.471 --> 50:12.141
No, no, no, this wasn't
the right graffiti.

50:14.376 --> 50:16.278
- It's an upper floor?
- Yeah, yeah.

50:17.280 --> 50:19.016
Yeah, the stairs, yeah.

50:31.793 --> 50:33.693
You said you saw
open cans of food,

50:33.695 --> 50:35.829
that can give us an idea
of who's in here.

50:35.831 --> 50:37.597
Ok, I saw, I saw...

50:37.599 --> 50:40.633
I saw two cans of food
a spoon, and a table.

50:42.438 --> 50:45.041
Someone's coming,
someone's coming, Art!

50:45.641 --> 50:46.576
Who's there?

50:52.181 --> 50:53.682
Hey, I don't know
who that is, but...

50:54.650 --> 50:57.521
there's a lot of us,
so don't try anything stupid.

50:58.588 --> 50:59.556
Shit, it's Bella!

51:03.192 --> 51:04.891
What happened? Are you ok?

51:04.893 --> 51:05.892
He killed him, killed him!

51:05.894 --> 51:07.695
What are you talking about?

51:07.697 --> 51:09.396
Santa killed Cutler.

51:09.398 --> 51:11.197
What are you saying?

51:11.199 --> 51:13.269
A guy in a fucking Santa's mask
killed Cutler.

51:14.369 --> 51:16.470
- You're kidding, right?
- Where did it happen?

51:16.472 --> 51:18.838
On the second floor,
he killed him.

51:18.840 --> 51:20.777
We must get the fuck out
of here.

51:21.878 --> 51:23.744
Ok, just breathe, Bella,
calm down.

51:23.746 --> 51:25.215
I can't calm down.

51:25.481 --> 51:27.217
No way, this has to be a trick.

51:28.150 --> 51:30.517
No, we need to get
the fuck out of here now.

51:30.519 --> 51:32.653
And leave Cutler behind,
especially if he's hurt?

51:32.655 --> 51:34.188
He's dead!

51:34.190 --> 51:35.588
There's nothing we can do,

51:35.590 --> 51:37.791
if we don't get out
we'll be the next ones.

51:37.793 --> 51:40.293
Fuck that, I'm gonna find him,
I won't leave my friend behind.

51:40.295 --> 51:41.464
I'm coming with you.

51:42.532 --> 51:44.300
- Are you coming?
- You wanna show us where?

51:44.534 --> 51:45.869
I can't.

51:46.601 --> 51:49.806
Wow, that's fucked, Bella,
real fucked.

51:50.472 --> 51:52.275
I gotta go find him myself.

51:53.476 --> 51:55.575
Don't leave me, please,
don't leave me.

51:55.577 --> 51:57.114
I'm sorry, Bella.

51:58.581 --> 51:59.749
Fuck!

52:01.317 --> 52:02.885
Fuck, fuck!

52:23.371 --> 52:24.740
I think this is the floor.

52:42.757 --> 52:44.293
I think it's this way.

52:46.528 --> 52:47.496
Right behind you.

53:09.284 --> 53:11.221
Deck the halls.

53:50.793 --> 53:53.896
Tis the season to be jolly.

54:35.804 --> 54:36.839
That's the room.

54:37.840 --> 54:39.875
- That's the room right there.
- Stay behind me.

55:00.396 --> 55:01.498
There's no one in here.

55:02.530 --> 55:04.097
Wait, no, she was there!

55:04.099 --> 55:07.066
No, no, no,
there was someone right here!

55:07.068 --> 55:09.436
There was a girl right here
and blood.

55:09.438 --> 55:11.675
And I dropped
my lantern right there!

55:12.141 --> 55:13.639
This is one of your...

55:13.641 --> 55:15.141
No, I swear, Robbie,
this is not a game.

55:15.143 --> 55:18.547
Look, there's chains on the bed!

55:18.748 --> 55:20.916
I don't know it's probably,
this is an old place

55:21.916 --> 55:23.816
No, no, I'm telling you, Robbie,

55:23.818 --> 55:26.489
there is seriously something
fucked up going on here.

55:27.021 --> 55:28.988
Let's find the others
and get out of here.

55:28.990 --> 55:31.927
No, no, no, I am telling you
the truth.

55:34.028 --> 55:35.465
I'm done with this.

56:12.701 --> 56:14.735
No, this just doesn't
make any sense.

56:14.737 --> 56:16.737
I don't know how she could've
gone out that room.

56:16.739 --> 56:18.539
Where the fuck
is everybody else?

56:18.541 --> 56:20.441
The same place as
your imaginary friend.

56:20.443 --> 56:21.711
My god, this is so crazy.

56:22.177 --> 56:24.110
Oh, by the way,

56:24.112 --> 56:25.612
good idea to play hide and seek
in a place like this.

56:25.614 --> 56:27.180
Are you kidding me?

56:27.182 --> 56:28.648
I'm not the one who decides
to come in here to play

56:28.650 --> 56:29.983
the adventurer or explorer

56:29.985 --> 56:31.818
or whatever
this stupid game's called.

56:31.820 --> 56:33.155
Oh, now you decide
to say no to something.

56:33.621 --> 56:35.121
What's that supposed to mean?

56:35.123 --> 56:36.889
Know what?
Whatever, I don't care.

56:36.891 --> 56:40.529
Help me find my friends,
and get the hell out of here.

56:53.074 --> 56:54.943
Seems like some kind of joke.

56:55.177 --> 56:57.244
A kind of Cutler mind fuck.

56:57.246 --> 57:00.150
I know what I saw, Art, I'll
never forget that fucking mask.

57:00.583 --> 57:02.081
- Clear.
- God, I can't even...

57:02.083 --> 57:03.950
I need to see it for myself.

57:03.952 --> 57:06.623
Call me skeptical, but a guy
in a fucking Santa mask?

57:06.956 --> 57:08.557
Why the hell
did you make us come in here?

57:10.059 --> 57:11.728
Clear.
I didn't make you do shit.

57:11.927 --> 57:13.463
I don't have to play the game.

57:13.795 --> 57:16.432
Fuck you, Art, you're a real
piece of work, you know?

57:16.798 --> 57:18.835
Yeah, takes one to know one,
right?

57:19.501 --> 57:21.068
Can we stop fighting?

57:21.070 --> 57:22.970
Kate, I wouldn't get
in the middle of this.

57:22.972 --> 57:24.541
Art and I have history
of hating each other.

57:25.039 --> 57:28.143
Yes, better to be a by-stand
than it is to be in the way.

57:28.543 --> 57:30.276
Yeah, Art likes
to manipulate things because

57:30.278 --> 57:31.847
he's the fucking king.

57:32.648 --> 57:34.050
I learned it
from a bitch or two.

57:34.516 --> 57:36.118
God, just make it out of here.

57:36.851 --> 57:39.455
- Once we find Cutler.
- And everyone else.

57:43.726 --> 57:45.128
Oh, man.

57:53.101 --> 57:54.570
What the fu...

58:17.826 --> 58:19.795
- Oh my god.
- Jesus fuck.

58:24.266 --> 58:25.934
There's no other way out
of this room.

58:48.289 --> 58:50.757
We have to find a way out.

58:50.759 --> 58:52.258
Fuck, we have
to get out of here.

58:52.260 --> 58:54.630
Quick, help me move this.

58:54.929 --> 58:55.998
Oh my god.

58:57.032 --> 58:58.701
We can't go back out there,
he's fucking there.

59:00.202 --> 59:01.969
Windows, we can go out
the windows.

59:01.971 --> 59:04.972
Great idea, Kate,
let's jump 40 feet, fuck!

59:04.974 --> 59:06.974
Ok, help me move this!

59:09.878 --> 59:13.650
Why is this happening?

59:14.349 --> 59:17.249
Bella, shut the fuck up,
find something to fight with.

59:17.251 --> 59:19.219
There's two of us and one of him
and we are not going down

59:19.221 --> 59:20.722
without a fight, now go!

59:25.793 --> 59:26.728
Wait.

59:27.929 --> 59:28.996
Did you hear that?

59:30.632 --> 59:31.833
It's coming from this floor.

59:33.101 --> 59:34.770
We need to grab something
to fight with.

59:48.951 --> 59:49.918
How's this?

59:51.353 --> 59:52.755
Yeah, that's good.

59:53.322 --> 59:54.657
Let's go.

01:00:29.257 --> 01:00:30.626
Wait.

01:00:32.161 --> 01:00:33.262
It stopped.

01:00:35.797 --> 01:00:37.132
I think he was down there.

01:00:39.902 --> 01:00:40.970
He's got us here.

01:00:41.836 --> 01:00:42.972
He's close.

01:00:43.771 --> 01:00:44.806
Keep your head on a swivel.

01:00:47.175 --> 01:00:50.112
Whisper what you'll bring to me.

01:00:57.952 --> 01:01:00.222
I'm going to die
in this fucking room!

01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:02.925
Jesus Christ, Bella,
pull yourself together!

01:01:03.992 --> 01:01:05.762
Wait, Robbie, Robbie.

01:01:06.161 --> 01:01:07.163
Did you hear that?

01:01:37.259 --> 01:01:38.226
Wait.

01:01:39.327 --> 01:01:41.396
The door.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.068
It's probably where
those screams came from.

01:01:48.804 --> 01:01:51.003
I won't fucking die
in this room, fucking die!

01:01:51.005 --> 01:01:52.875
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:01:55.844 --> 01:01:57.146
Don't open!

01:01:58.447 --> 01:01:59.715
Wait, Kate?

01:02:00.382 --> 01:02:01.818
Bella, is that you?

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:04.086
It's Margo, it's Margo!

01:02:05.186 --> 01:02:08.188
Do not let her in!

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:09.291
What?

01:02:10.291 --> 01:02:11.960
Guys, this is us, let us in!

01:02:13.094 --> 01:02:16.028
- Bella, we have to...
- He could be using her, Kate.

01:02:16.030 --> 01:02:17.329
Do not let her in.

01:02:17.331 --> 01:02:19.101
Guys, are you in there?

01:02:19.835 --> 01:02:20.900
Are you ok?

01:02:20.902 --> 01:02:22.235
Robbie is out there too.

01:02:22.237 --> 01:02:25.237
Robbie could be fucking Santa!

01:02:25.239 --> 01:02:28.243
- Do not let her in.
- Bella, I'm opening the door.

01:02:28.876 --> 01:02:33.081
Fuck, yeah, sure, just kill us.
That's fucking great!

01:02:33.414 --> 01:02:36.349
- Oh my god!
- Come here, come here!

01:02:36.351 --> 01:02:38.121
What happened?

01:02:39.288 --> 01:02:42.088
He fucking killed Cutler!

01:02:42.090 --> 01:02:45.258
- Who, me?
- Art, too, Art's dead too.

01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:48.561
What the fuck are you saying?
I didn't kill anybody.

01:02:48.563 --> 01:02:49.965
Cutler and Art are dead?

01:02:50.398 --> 01:02:53.101
Oh my god!
No, no he was with me.

01:02:53.501 --> 01:02:55.505
Bella, he was with me
the whole time.

01:02:56.170 --> 01:02:58.840
Who the fuck killed Cutler
and who killed Art?

01:02:59.041 --> 01:03:01.307
Some fucking freak
with a Santa mask.

01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:03.108
A Santa mask, really?

01:03:03.110 --> 01:03:06.012
There was a girl
on the fifth floor,

01:03:06.014 --> 01:03:07.914
she was chained,
blood all over the bed

01:03:07.916 --> 01:03:09.548
and she said somebody
is in here.

01:03:09.550 --> 01:03:13.253
That explains the cans of food
I found in the kitchen.

01:03:13.255 --> 01:03:17.360
I'm telling you there was a hobo
serial killer rapist in here!

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:19.262
So, so fucked.

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:22.262
We have to phone the police.

01:03:22.264 --> 01:03:24.363
We can't call the police, Margo.

01:03:24.365 --> 01:03:26.999
There's no fucking service
in this hick town.

01:03:27.001 --> 01:03:29.304
We need to get the fuck
out of here, then!

01:03:30.905 --> 01:03:32.007
Where are the car keys?

01:03:34.208 --> 01:03:35.310
Where are the car keys?

01:03:37.012 --> 01:03:37.980
Cutler.

01:03:40.148 --> 01:03:42.818
I am not going back there!

01:03:44.552 --> 01:03:46.855
Ok, someone has to or we are not
getting out of here.

01:03:50.157 --> 01:03:52.594
Fuck, you three stay together.

01:03:53.262 --> 01:03:55.298
I'll go get the keys,
where's Cutler?

01:03:57.099 --> 01:03:59.335
Down the hall,
in one of the last rooms.

01:04:00.969 --> 01:04:02.635
I'm going with you,

01:04:02.637 --> 01:04:04.403
there's a killer on the loose,
you can't go alone.

01:04:04.405 --> 01:04:06.208
You can't leave us in here,
it's a death trap.

01:04:06.541 --> 01:04:09.275
Why don't you meet us in
the kitchen, where we came in.

01:04:09.277 --> 01:04:11.411
We'll get the keys
and meet you there.

01:04:11.413 --> 01:04:13.947
We're coming down with you and
we'll split in the staircase.

01:04:13.949 --> 01:04:15.180
Ok, let's go.

01:04:22.190 --> 01:04:24.994
Deck the halls.

01:04:47.949 --> 01:04:49.417
What the fuck?

01:05:41.135 --> 01:05:42.267
It's clear.

01:05:42.269 --> 01:05:43.972
Come on, stay close.

01:05:44.438 --> 01:05:46.539
It's just at the end
of this hallway, ok?

01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:48.577
Ok, let's go.

01:05:57.418 --> 01:05:58.987
Wait, wait, wait.

01:05:59.353 --> 01:06:00.686
We'll see you downstairs, ok?

01:06:00.688 --> 01:06:02.322
You're going to be ok?

01:06:02.324 --> 01:06:04.224
I think so,
just please be quick.

01:06:04.226 --> 01:06:06.295
As quick as we can be.
Please, do.

01:06:11.733 --> 01:06:13.501
Does this seem strange?

01:06:14.135 --> 01:06:16.235
How do you know this is not
a fucked-up game?

01:06:16.237 --> 01:06:17.537
Why would they do that?

01:06:17.539 --> 01:06:19.204
Are you kidding?

01:06:19.206 --> 01:06:21.106
These people
are completely narcissistic.

01:06:21.108 --> 01:06:22.508
All they do is get fucked up
and play these stupid games.

01:06:22.510 --> 01:06:24.476
I thought you liked them
as roommates!

01:06:24.478 --> 01:06:26.646
Better than being alone,
but doesn't mean I like this.

01:06:26.648 --> 01:06:29.352
Ok, this isn't a game, Robbie.

01:06:29.550 --> 01:06:30.717
How do you know that?

01:06:30.719 --> 01:06:32.418
I saw Art get killed!

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:33.619
Yeah, how he died?

01:06:33.621 --> 01:06:35.991
I mean... I don't know.

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:40.526
So you never actually
saw him die?

01:06:40.528 --> 01:06:42.061
No, but...

01:06:42.063 --> 01:06:43.695
And you never saw
Cutler die either?

01:06:43.697 --> 01:06:45.164
You just took Bella's word.

01:06:45.166 --> 01:06:46.833
Yeah, but did you see the look...

01:06:46.835 --> 01:06:48.367
Are you kidding me?

01:06:48.369 --> 01:06:50.570
This is to fuck
with the newbies!

01:06:50.572 --> 01:06:53.773
What about the cans?
I saw them with my own eyes.

01:06:53.775 --> 01:06:55.708
Oh, yeah?
Maybe there was a hobo around,

01:06:55.710 --> 01:06:57.746
that doesn't mean there's
some fucking psycho killer!

01:06:59.114 --> 01:07:01.548
Until I see fucking evidence,
I don't believe shit.

01:07:01.550 --> 01:07:03.719
We're about to find out,
we're here.

01:07:04.552 --> 01:07:05.721
Moment of truth.

01:07:08.690 --> 01:07:09.724
Oh my god.

01:07:10.358 --> 01:07:11.327
Oh, shit.

01:07:12.193 --> 01:07:14.126
- See?
- Oh my god, this isn't a game.

01:07:14.128 --> 01:07:16.632
Of course not, people
don't die playing games!

01:07:17.532 --> 01:07:20.302
We need to find the keys
and get the fuck out of here.

01:07:21.436 --> 01:07:23.672
- So, so fucked.
- I'm not finding anything.

01:07:24.139 --> 01:07:26.271
There's no keys,
no wallet, nothing.

01:07:26.273 --> 01:07:29.575
Oh, god, I'm sorry,
I'm so, so sorry.

01:07:29.577 --> 01:07:31.610
I'm so, so sorry.

01:07:31.612 --> 01:07:32.614
Where is his backpack?

01:07:33.347 --> 01:07:34.847
I don't see it.

01:07:34.849 --> 01:07:36.418
God dammit,
the killer probably took it!

01:07:37.518 --> 01:07:39.519
What do we do?

01:07:39.521 --> 01:07:42.425
Ok, we need to calm, focus,
and come up with another plan.

01:07:58.139 --> 01:08:00.408
The kitchen's
through there, wait.

01:08:01.208 --> 01:08:02.909
Can we wait in the hallway?

01:08:02.911 --> 01:08:05.280
I don't want to get trapped,
it'll be easy to find us.

01:08:05.746 --> 01:08:08.715
And the killer, we should just
get the fuck out of here.

01:08:08.717 --> 01:08:10.450
What about Kate and Robbie?

01:08:10.452 --> 01:08:12.188
It's not safe in here, Margo.

01:08:12.454 --> 01:08:14.320
We can't just leave them.

01:08:14.322 --> 01:08:15.724
Fuck them, I don't know them.

01:08:16.256 --> 01:08:17.626
Are you for real right now?

01:08:17.926 --> 01:08:19.558
Margo, there's a killer
on the loose,

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:21.627
we need
to get the fuck out of here.

01:08:21.630 --> 01:08:22.596
And go where?

01:08:22.898 --> 01:08:24.300
Anywhere.

01:08:25.198 --> 01:08:26.402
No, that's not right.

01:08:26.635 --> 01:08:28.634
It wasn't right to come here.

01:08:28.636 --> 01:08:30.206
Yeah, we're here now, ok?

01:08:31.471 --> 01:08:33.505
We're not just leaving them,
we're in the middle of nowhere,

01:08:33.506 --> 01:08:36.412
- it's pitch black and freezing.
- Shush.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.510
Where are you gonna go?

01:08:38.511 --> 01:08:41.117
Who the fuck cares?
Just get the fuck out of here.

01:08:49.791 --> 01:08:50.759
The kitchen's there.

01:08:52.225 --> 01:08:55.162
No, Bella, I've told you,
I'm not leaving them.

01:08:55.697 --> 01:08:57.196
I can't go alone

01:08:57.198 --> 01:08:58.564
You're stuck here, doesn't it?

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:00.703
Oh my god, don't do this to me.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.171
You know what, Bella?
You do you.

01:09:04.939 --> 01:09:06.307
I hate you.

01:09:07.242 --> 01:09:09.912
Oh my god, why?

01:09:12.212 --> 01:09:13.679
Why is this happening?

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:15.881
Why they killed Cutler?
What the fuck is going on?

01:09:15.884 --> 01:09:16.850
Hey.

01:09:17.685 --> 01:09:19.319
Everything is going to be ok.

01:09:19.621 --> 01:09:21.356
We're gonna get out of here,
I promise.

01:09:22.457 --> 01:09:23.425
Okay.

01:09:30.296 --> 01:09:31.332
You hear that?

01:09:32.466 --> 01:09:35.537
We need to find Bella and Margo
and get out of here.

01:09:35.970 --> 01:09:37.337
Hurry!

01:09:51.519 --> 01:09:53.322
This way, this way!

01:10:03.797 --> 01:10:05.201
This way.

01:10:11.273 --> 01:10:12.307
Check in there.

01:10:38.766 --> 01:10:40.402
Bella, Bella?

01:10:41.802 --> 01:10:42.938
Bella!

01:10:44.672 --> 01:10:46.839
I can't open the door!

01:10:46.841 --> 01:10:50.378
Stop, I can't!

01:10:52.846 --> 01:10:53.782
Bella!

01:10:56.818 --> 01:10:58.420
Stop, stop it!

01:10:59.621 --> 01:11:01.556
I can't, I can't, stop!

01:11:02.090 --> 01:11:05.560
Stop, my god, stop!
I can't, I can't.

01:11:06.493 --> 01:11:08.264
Please, please!

01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:13.535
Bella!

01:11:15.537 --> 01:11:16.939
Oh my god, he's here!

01:11:17.505 --> 01:11:18.373
Stop!

01:11:22.743 --> 01:11:23.911
Fuck you!

01:11:25.913 --> 01:11:27.282
Fuck you!

01:11:27.881 --> 01:11:29.484
No, no!

01:11:30.885 --> 01:11:31.718
Fuck you!

01:11:34.555 --> 01:11:36.391
No, no!

01:11:37.057 --> 01:11:39.328
Please, please, please!

01:12:01.783 --> 01:12:02.949
Where are they?

01:12:02.951 --> 01:12:04.353
What the fuck?

01:12:11.993 --> 01:12:14.693
Ok, the screams came
from that way.

01:12:14.695 --> 01:12:16.528
No, I'm done with this.

01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:18.600
I don't know these people
and neither do you.

01:12:21.403 --> 01:12:23.105
Fuck, fuck!

01:12:40.587 --> 01:12:41.724
Fuck this shit.

01:13:08.515 --> 01:13:09.484
Margo?

01:13:16.123 --> 01:13:17.458
Bella?

01:13:24.765 --> 01:13:26.033
Margo, where are you?

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:42.875
Holy shit.

01:14:50.685 --> 01:14:52.654
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:16:13.234 --> 01:16:14.703
Fuck, fuck.

01:17:24.204 --> 01:17:27.809
Fuck you, fuck you
you fucking weirdo.

01:17:29.877 --> 01:17:31.413
Oh, I wasn't the freak?

01:17:37.085 --> 01:17:40.052
Art? But I saw you die.

01:17:40.054 --> 01:17:41.390
What the fuck, I saw you die!

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:42.858
But did you really?

01:17:50.230 --> 01:17:51.198
What the...

01:18:13.921 --> 01:18:15.257
What's wrong with you?

01:18:15.489 --> 01:18:17.125
I told you I loved you
and you...

01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:18.894
threw it in my face.

01:18:19.926 --> 01:18:21.362
Made me the body of jokes

01:18:21.796 --> 01:18:24.162
then paraded your relationship
with Cutler

01:18:24.164 --> 01:18:26.499
in front of me
like I didn't matter.

01:18:26.501 --> 01:18:28.470
You fucking kill everyone.

01:18:29.537 --> 01:18:31.102
I just wanted you and Cutler

01:18:31.104 --> 01:18:32.840
but your friends keep
getting in the way.

01:18:33.975 --> 01:18:35.744
You're going to rot in hell!

01:18:35.943 --> 01:18:38.814
I've got a while, but you
keep it warm for me down there.

01:18:46.386 --> 01:18:47.855
Oh my god, oh my god!

01:18:49.457 --> 01:18:51.293
Oh, oh my god!

01:18:52.025 --> 01:18:53.028
You're the tree guy!

01:18:54.828 --> 01:18:55.963
Thank you, thank you!

01:18:56.898 --> 01:18:58.500
No, please don't, please don't.

01:19:00.301 --> 01:19:02.170
You were right when you said
I was creepy.

01:19:09.476 --> 01:19:11.011
Oh, I like this.

01:19:14.515 --> 01:19:15.851
Thanks, buddy.

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:32.527
Merry Christmas.

01:20:41.335 --> 01:20:46.274
We wish you a Merry Christmas.
