00:00.738 --> 00:02.758
Previously on "Gilmore Girls"...

00:04.653 --> 00:06.767
"Once Luke Danes
is in your life,

00:06.777 --> 00:08.791
he is in your life forever."

00:12.512 --> 00:16.065
Obviously you still have very
deep feelings for the guy.

00:16.076 --> 00:17.672
As you know, this course...

00:18.321 --> 00:20.516
will take a specific look at...

00:20.535 --> 00:22.943
processes and determinants...

00:22.953 --> 00:25.310
- Tell me you're not in love with him.
- I'm not in love with him.

00:25.340 --> 00:28.026
And if you don't take this very
seriously, then this whole thing

00:28.038 --> 00:30.550
could fall apart faster than
you could possibly imagine.

00:30.560 --> 00:33.026
And he'll be gone,
and you'll be alone again.

00:33.450 --> 00:35.213
I can't be your rebound.

00:35.222 --> 00:36.658
I'm sorry.

00:38.099 --> 00:39.533
Christopher?

00:47.006 --> 00:49.153
- Ooh! What is that?
- It's just my phone.

00:49.168 --> 00:51.492
Holy smoke! I don't know
what I thought that was --

00:51.508 --> 00:53.622
some alarm on your
pants or something.

00:53.637 --> 00:56.432
No, that's not my pants alarm. The
pants alarm sounds more like a siren.

00:56.468 --> 00:58.360
You want to answer that?
Should we put this down?

00:58.398 --> 01:02.122
That's okay. I'm afraid if we put
it down, we won't pick it up again.

01:02.135 --> 01:03.821
Oh, this is gonna be good,

01:03.835 --> 01:06.151
what with this one here
and the two palms,

01:06.167 --> 01:08.843
oh, boy, Morey's eyes are
gonna pop out of his head!

01:08.855 --> 01:11.410
Why? Does he find plants
particularly startling?

01:11.428 --> 01:12.951
- I'm making a jungle.
- A jungle?

01:12.965 --> 01:14.443
- For the bedroom.
- Ugh! Enough said.

01:14.455 --> 01:17.412
- Hey, is that your inside phone?
- Yeah, I'll call them back.

01:17.428 --> 01:20.530
So, anyway, I got this negligee
with sort of a snake pattern.

01:20.545 --> 01:21.731
Oh, boy! Is this heavy!

01:21.747 --> 01:23.260
It is. It is. I'm sorry, doll.

01:23.276 --> 01:25.583
I wasn't hoping that you
would lug this with me.

01:25.598 --> 01:27.171
I was planning on
asking Christopher.

01:27.186 --> 01:28.283
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:28.296 --> 01:30.162
I haven't seen him much lately.

01:30.178 --> 01:32.223
Well, his work keeps him busy.

01:32.236 --> 01:35.173
What's he do -- something with
computers? Very mysterious.

01:35.186 --> 01:36.913
Yeah, he's a man of mystery.

01:36.926 --> 01:38.912
You know who's a man
of mystery? Morey.

01:38.926 --> 01:41.180
After decades in the bedroom,
who would have thought

01:41.197 --> 01:44.590
that the idea of dressing up like a
howler monkey would be such a turn-on?

01:44.608 --> 01:47.081
Right. I'm gonna get this,
Babette. Hello?

01:47.695 --> 01:48.923
Rory?

01:49.226 --> 01:51.012
Honey, what's wrong?

01:52.356 --> 01:54.061
Oh, no.

01:55.315 --> 01:56.701
On my way.

01:57.046 --> 01:58.593
Sorry, Babette!

02:00.505 --> 02:02.141
Morey!

03:15.346 --> 03:17.813
Excuse me, miss.
Is that your phone?

03:17.825 --> 03:19.853
Oh. Um, sorry.

03:20.637 --> 03:21.860
H-Hello?

03:21.876 --> 03:23.273
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.601
- I'm here.
- Good.

03:24.615 --> 03:26.841
- Where are you?
- I'm here. I'm in the waiting room.

03:26.856 --> 03:29.573
Uh, okay.
I must be in the wrong waiting room.

03:29.585 --> 03:32.473
I'm not in the E.R. anymore.
I'm in the cardiac intensive-care unit,

03:32.486 --> 03:33.653
the C.I.C.U.

03:33.668 --> 03:35.682
That's where I am, I think.
First floor?

03:35.698 --> 03:36.612
First floor.

03:36.628 --> 03:38.291
There's a red stripe
on the floor.

03:38.306 --> 03:40.073
It's kind of orange here.

03:40.085 --> 03:42.481
- Orange?
- Reddish-orange, so maybe.

03:42.495 --> 03:45.413
Well, yeah, orangey red.
Maybe the lights make it look more red.

03:45.427 --> 03:47.182
- Oh. Hi.
- Hey.

03:47.437 --> 03:50.570
Um, they're doing tests,
so that's where he is --

03:50.585 --> 03:52.303
blood tests and another E.K.G.

03:52.317 --> 03:55.382
They did an E.K.G. in the ambulance, but
I guess they're still trying to determine

03:55.415 --> 03:57.932
how much damage was actually
caused by the heart attack.

03:57.947 --> 04:01.071
But that's definitely what it was.
It was a myocardial infarction,

04:01.086 --> 04:02.362
which is a heart attack.

04:02.378 --> 04:06.200
I guess the E.K.G. tells them how
bad the blockage of his arteries is

04:06.217 --> 04:09.470
and what degree of
coronary-artery disease he has,

04:09.486 --> 04:10.843
or C.A.D.,
as they're calling it,

04:10.857 --> 04:13.772
because, apparently, everything is --
what do you call it?

04:13.786 --> 04:17.272
An anagram? What's the thing
with the letters? Acronym.

04:17.286 --> 04:20.072
The C.A.D.,
C.I.C.U., the E.K.G.

04:21.935 --> 04:24.721
Mom, it was awful.
He just fell down.

04:26.925 --> 04:28.440
It's gonna be okay.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.582
Hi, Chris, it's me again.

04:33.597 --> 04:35.621
Uh... I'm at the hospital now,

04:35.636 --> 04:39.633
and, um, it was a heart attack,
but dad's okay.

04:39.645 --> 04:41.251
He's just getting some tests.

04:41.268 --> 04:45.742
So, um... we're in the C.I.C.U.
at John Skinner medical center.

04:45.757 --> 04:49.463
It's on the first floor, and there's
a red stripe running down the hallway.

04:49.478 --> 04:51.912
Just please call me when you get this,
okay? Thanks.

04:58.546 --> 05:00.963
Well, my brain wasn't up to
choosing between things,

05:00.976 --> 05:02.441
so I got one of everything.

05:02.455 --> 05:03.653
You do me proud.

05:03.666 --> 05:05.433
So, grandma's on her way.
I didn't talk to her,

05:05.467 --> 05:07.550
but the girl at the club
said she's en route.

05:07.567 --> 05:09.391
Oh, okay. And what about dad?

05:09.405 --> 05:11.511
Oh, he's probably... en route.

05:11.528 --> 05:13.531
Hmm. Is everything okay?

05:13.548 --> 05:15.273
Yeah, I don't think he's
gotten my messages yet,

05:15.306 --> 05:16.931
but he'll be here when he does.

05:16.947 --> 05:17.982
Okay.

05:17.996 --> 05:19.882
Well... what is your pleasure? 

05:19.896 --> 05:21.762
Well, let's see.

05:22.057 --> 05:24.721
Uh... nothing sweet,
I don't think.

05:24.737 --> 05:26.370
No? A salty thing?

05:26.386 --> 05:28.390
A fluorescent-orange
ersatz-cheese thing?

05:28.405 --> 05:29.530
I guess I'm not hungry.

05:29.546 --> 05:30.991
Yeah, me neither.

05:32.587 --> 05:34.521
I keep thinking this is
all just a nightmare.

05:34.537 --> 05:36.040
-  I know.
- But it's not.

05:36.056 --> 05:38.200
No. I mean, it's a nightmare
but not a nightmare nightmare.

05:38.237 --> 05:40.691
I  know 'cause I have shoes on. In my
nightmares, I never am wearing shoes.

05:40.726 --> 05:42.130
- I didn't know that.
- Yeah, yeah.

05:42.148 --> 05:44.433
It's the worst thing in the dream, too.
I could be chased by snakes

05:44.506 --> 05:47.592
or in a nuclear explosion,
but then I look down,

05:47.607 --> 05:49.511
and, "oh, my god!
I'm not wearing shoes!"

05:49.528 --> 05:50.852
I wonder what that means.

05:50.865 --> 05:53.720
Probably means I have a fear
of hurting my bare feet

05:53.738 --> 05:55.313
or of losing my shoes.

05:55.327 --> 05:56.543
Not so freudian, huh?

05:56.556 --> 06:00.392
For me, a snake is just a snake,
a slingback is just a slingback.

06:00.406 --> 06:01.640
Gilmore?

06:03.006 --> 06:05.240
Hi. I'm Dr. Goldstein.

06:05.255 --> 06:07.540
- You're Richard Gilmore's family?
- Yes. Is he okay?

06:07.556 --> 06:10.063
He's doing all right.
He's conscious, cogent,

06:10.076 --> 06:11.922
and not in
significant pain now.

06:11.937 --> 06:13.111
- Oh, good.
- Good.

06:13.127 --> 06:15.841
We just sent him to the cath
lab to get an angiogram.

06:15.858 --> 06:18.460
After that,
we should be able to get a better sense

06:18.476 --> 06:20.892
of what kind of blockage
is around his heart

06:20.906 --> 06:23.040
and then we'll be able to figure
out where to go from there.

06:23.078 --> 06:25.233
- Where would we go?
- Uh, pardon?

06:25.246 --> 06:27.893
I mean, where --
where would we go?

06:27.906 --> 06:30.040
Well, if the blockage
is more serious,

06:30.055 --> 06:33.441
we will have to consider an
emergency bypass surgery.

06:33.657 --> 06:34.502
Okay.

06:34.515 --> 06:37.222
I promise to let you know as soon as
we get the results from the cath lab.

06:37.256 --> 06:39.410
- Try not to worry.
- No, not worried.

06:39.425 --> 06:42.183
Just normal amount of worried for
someone whose father's had a heart attack,

06:42.216 --> 06:43.371
but not excessively worried.

06:43.387 --> 06:44.580
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:44.598 --> 06:45.672
Thank you, doctor.

06:45.687 --> 06:46.963
I'll see you in a little bit.

06:55.506 --> 06:57.223
- Have you seen him?
- Oh, hi, mom.

06:57.236 --> 06:58.703
No, not since he
was in the E.R.

06:58.715 --> 06:59.743
Where is he?

06:59.756 --> 07:02.673
The doctor came out and said he's in
the cath lab, getting an angiogram.

07:02.688 --> 07:03.963
He's gonna let us
know when he's done.

07:03.997 --> 07:05.580
- Nonsense.
- No, it's true.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.896
He said he would come back
when he had the results.

07:07.910 --> 07:10.353
I'm Emily Gilmore.
I would like to see my husband.

07:10.362 --> 07:12.028
Let's see.
What is your husband's name?

07:12.039 --> 07:13.813
Gilmore! Richard Gilmore!

07:13.826 --> 07:15.590
I'm his wife,
and I would like to see him now.

07:15.625 --> 07:18.033
I'm sorry, he's in the cath lab
right now, getting an angiogram.

07:18.068 --> 07:20.053
The doctor will come find
you as soon as they're done.

07:20.085 --> 07:22.272
There's no need to
be cheery about it.

07:22.285 --> 07:25.243
Honestly, someone with your chipper
personality ought to be a weather girl

07:25.247 --> 07:26.801
or a preschool teacher.

07:26.817 --> 07:28.122
I'm sorry you feel that way.

07:28.135 --> 07:30.011
Oh, please. Don't mope.

07:30.026 --> 07:31.912
What happened to all
the competent people?

07:31.925 --> 07:33.180
That's what I'd like to know.

07:33.196 --> 07:35.311
Was there some giant
hole they all fell into

07:35.326 --> 07:37.141
or a virus that
struck them all down,

07:37.158 --> 07:39.603
leaving the morons of the
world to sit behind the desks?

07:39.615 --> 07:41.711
Mom, wouldn't you like to sit down,
have a nice cup of tea?

07:41.747 --> 07:43.102
I don't want a cup of tea.
What I want

07:43.137 --> 07:45.370
is the most perfunctory level
of competence from the people

07:45.407 --> 07:48.090
with whom I interact. That apparently
is far too much to ask for.

07:48.105 --> 07:50.030
- Grandma, we have snacks.
- Yes, mom, snacks.

07:50.047 --> 07:51.980
We have salty snacks
and sweet snacks

07:51.995 --> 07:54.740
and sweet/salty hybrid snacks.

07:54.757 --> 07:57.373
Even at the club, I'm telling you,
the young men and women that work there

07:57.407 --> 07:59.703
must have a combined I.Q.
of a grapefruit.

07:59.716 --> 08:01.110
You ask them for a towel,

08:01.125 --> 08:03.521
and they look at you with
the most vacant eyes.

08:03.537 --> 08:06.282
I'm telling you, I thought the
girl at reception was blind

08:06.296 --> 08:08.043
the entire first month
she worked there --

08:08.055 --> 08:11.153
blind, but very enthusiastic
about the application of eyeliner.

08:11.168 --> 08:12.213
Sounds pretty.

08:12.227 --> 08:13.793
My husband has a heart attack,

08:13.805 --> 08:16.021
and how long does it
take them to find me?

08:16.036 --> 08:17.851
40 minutes.

08:17.868 --> 08:21.381
The nitwit probably got lost between
the front desk and the tennis courts.

08:21.395 --> 08:23.161
I'm sorry, Grandma,
that sounds terrible.

08:23.178 --> 08:24.983
I mean, none of this would have
been a problem if I'd been allowed

08:25.018 --> 08:26.471
to keep my cellphone. But no.

08:26.485 --> 08:28.580
Cellphones have been banned allegedly

08:28.598 --> 08:29.940
because of noise pollution.

08:29.958 --> 08:32.133
If that's the reason,
they should ban John Abbott.

08:32.148 --> 08:33.993
Because I'm telling you,
every time that man hits a ball,

08:34.028 --> 08:36.051
he grunts like a rutting hog.

08:36.067 --> 08:37.821
He's twice as loud
as my cellphone.

08:37.836 --> 08:40.961
They won't even let you leave your
cellphone on vibrate. It's preposterous.

08:40.975 --> 08:43.620
I mean, what do they think we're doing,
making drug deals?

08:43.636 --> 08:44.741
I doubt that's it.

08:44.758 --> 08:48.142
Which, by the way,
are absolutely, 100% taking place.

08:48.156 --> 08:50.650
I saw Devorah Inwood
handing Cardum Kelly

08:50.665 --> 08:52.653
a small, 
blue pill in the ladies' locker room

08:52.665 --> 08:54.471
while they made shady
eyes at each other.

08:54.486 --> 08:56.362
Drug deals at the club?
Mom, I don't think so.

08:56.377 --> 08:58.550
Absolutely.  The whole
place is going to the dogs.

08:58.565 --> 09:01.911
Oh, and now apparently, they want
to start charging us for meals,

09:01.928 --> 09:05.030
on top of the king's ransom we
pay in dues. It's appalling.

09:05.048 --> 09:08.641
The very idea of charging extra
for the junk they serve there.

09:08.657 --> 09:11.763
Oh, and you know
what really irks me?

09:11.805 --> 09:14.151
They very rarely serve fish.

09:14.166 --> 09:16.791
That's  terrible,
especially for people who love fish.

09:16.805 --> 09:18.473
In a way,
it's their fault that Richard's here.

09:18.505 --> 09:19.691
Mom, what do you mean?

09:19.706 --> 09:21.792
2 1/2 months ago,
I read an article that said

09:21.908 --> 09:24.441
fish has been shown to prevent
heart attacks and stroke

09:24.456 --> 09:26.780
and has innumerable
other health benefits.

09:26.796 --> 09:27.712
Hey.

09:27.727 --> 09:29.701
It's the omega-3 fatty acids --

09:29.717 --> 09:32.843
that and the fact that it's an
incredibly lean source of protein.

09:32.855 --> 09:34.880
So I immedialety had the
maid cut out the article

09:34.896 --> 09:36.202
so I could show it to Richard.

09:36.218 --> 09:39.392
And he agreed to eat more fish,
but he said not for dinner.

09:39.408 --> 09:41.471
My spineless
kitchen staff caved.

09:41.488 --> 09:44.073
Emily, Lorelai, I'm so sorry.
How are you holding up?

09:44.087 --> 09:45.241
We're holding.

09:45.256 --> 09:46.842
Logan, it's so good
of you to come.

09:46.856 --> 09:49.442
Is there anything I can do for you?
Could I get you a cup of tea, maybe?

09:49.477 --> 09:51.023
I just asked.
She doesn't want tea.

09:51.036 --> 09:53.973
I would love a cup of tea.
That's very kind of you.

09:53.986 --> 09:55.581
I'm on a tea hunt, then.

09:56.865 --> 09:58.743
That's a fine young man,
Rory --

09:58.757 --> 10:00.541
very sweet, very considerate.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.532
I like him.

10:01.546 --> 10:03.161
He's one of the good ones.

10:05.227 --> 10:06.842
Lorelai, where's Christopher?

10:06.855 --> 10:08.130
Oh, he's on his way.

10:08.148 --> 10:09.320
From where?

10:09.336 --> 10:12.203
Um, uh... Dr. Goldstein.

10:12.547 --> 10:13.872
I'm Emily Gilmore.

10:13.886 --> 10:15.342
Good. I'm glad you're here.

10:15.358 --> 10:17.491
The blockage is worse
than we'd hoped.

10:17.507 --> 10:19.341
I think the best
course of action --

10:19.357 --> 10:21.101
really the only
course of action --

10:21.116 --> 10:22.990
is to do an emergency
bypass surgery.

10:23.006 --> 10:24.280
Open-heart surgery?

10:24.295 --> 10:25.371
Let him finish, Lorelai.

10:25.388 --> 10:26.971
We'd like to go into
surgery as soon as possible.

10:27.005 --> 10:29.731
So, now would be the time if
you'd like to visit with him.

10:29.745 --> 10:31.193
Yes. Yeah,
we'd like to see him.

10:31.205 --> 10:32.583
If you'll follow me please.

10:34.938 --> 10:37.603
Feel free to ask me any
questions you might have.

10:37.617 --> 10:39.703
Are you the one who will
be performing the surgery?

10:39.715 --> 10:42.082
Yes, along with a team.
I'll be the chief surgeon.

10:42.098 --> 10:43.760
Where did you go to school?

10:43.776 --> 10:44.851
I'm sorry?

10:44.866 --> 10:46.793
- You did attend school, didn't you?
- Mom.

10:46.806 --> 10:49.281
No, it's okay.
Yes, I got my B.A. at Yale.

10:49.297 --> 10:51.140
I went to medical
school at Harvard.

10:51.156 --> 10:53.323
I did my residency at
Columbia Presbyterian

10:53.336 --> 10:56.370
before I became chief of
cardiothoracic surgery here.

10:56.386 --> 10:57.702
- See?
- See what?

10:57.716 --> 10:59.610
Here we are.
I'll let you visit.

10:59.628 --> 11:02.891
A nurse will be by shortly to
begin prepping Richard for surgery.

11:02.906 --> 11:04.291
Thank you, doctor.

11:13.527 --> 11:16.852
And I watched his hands closely.
They're steady as a statue's.

11:16.865 --> 11:19.221
Oh, and, Richard,
he's Yale undergrad,

11:19.237 --> 11:20.402
Harvard medical school.

11:20.415 --> 11:21.571
You don't say.

11:21.585 --> 11:25.102
Well, if he does a good job,
I'll forget the Harvard part.

11:25.116 --> 11:27.592
I'll write that off as
a youthful indiscretion.

11:27.946 --> 11:29.893
This room is rather intimate.

11:29.907 --> 11:32.122
It's just fine, Emily.
I promise you.

11:32.138 --> 11:35.572
Now, Rory, I'm sorry I gave
you a scare in class today.

11:35.585 --> 11:37.542
No, don't be silly.
I'm just glad you're okay

11:37.555 --> 11:39.753
and that you're gonna be
more okay after the surgery.

11:39.765 --> 11:40.621
Thank you.

11:40.636 --> 11:43.072
Are you okay, dad? I mean, how are
you feeling, considering everything?

11:43.105 --> 11:44.381
You okay? You look okay.

11:44.397 --> 11:47.322
Well, all in all,
I think I'd rather be in Philadelphia.

11:47.338 --> 11:49.921
-  Ronald Reagan.
- Quoting W.C. Fields.

11:49.938 --> 11:52.242
- Oh, I didn't know that.
- It would be great time now.

11:52.257 --> 11:54.651
Winter in Philadelphia is a great
time to see the Liberty Bell

11:54.687 --> 11:57.671
and the cream cheese.
That's all I got on Philadelphia.

11:57.687 --> 11:58.491
Lorelai.

11:58.505 --> 12:00.830
Well, the cheesesteaks --
the Philly cheesesteaks.

12:00.847 --> 12:03.240
Lorelai, please. Richard,
is your neck getting enough support?

12:03.276 --> 12:04.620
It looks like you
need another pillow.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.391
I don't know.
I think it's all right.

12:06.406 --> 12:07.620
I got it, mom.

12:07.636 --> 12:09.120
I can take care of it.

12:09.137 --> 12:11.153
- I'm just handing you a pillow.
- I don't want that pillow.

12:11.185 --> 12:13.161
- What's wrong with that pillow?
- It doesn't have a pillowcase.

12:13.196 --> 12:14.683
Yes, it does. What's this?
It's a pillowcase.

12:14.717 --> 12:16.911
Yes, it has one pillowcase.
It should have two pillowcases

12:16.946 --> 12:18.841
one facing each ways,
so the pillow is never exposed.

12:18.855 --> 12:20.050
Now I have to ring for a pillow.

12:20.068 --> 12:21.551
Mother, we have a pillow right here, why--

12:21.565 --> 12:22.882
Tucson.

12:22.977 --> 12:25.371
- What?
- Tucson is extremely hot,

12:25.387 --> 12:28.201
and it has a dry climate that doesn't agree with me,

12:28.216 --> 12:31.781
and I really don't think much of the way they dress out there.

12:31.797 --> 12:34.821
And I have a deep aversion to cacti of all kinds.

12:34.835 --> 12:39.041
And yet Tucson is a place where I think I would rather be.

12:39.058 --> 12:40.793
Anywhere but here, right, dad?

12:40.807 --> 12:42.102
Although, it's awfully dry.

12:42.118 --> 12:43.171
And so hot.

12:43.188 --> 12:46.092
And you're right about the fashion -- ponchos and all that turquoise.

12:46.106 --> 12:49.142
Oh, and men in sandals. Spare me.

12:51.715 --> 12:53.162
So, how's it going there, Zach?

12:53.177 --> 12:56.181
Aces. Pastrami on rye --
mustard, no mayo.

12:56.198 --> 12:58.793
Cheeseburger --
swiss, double pickles, fries.

12:58.807 --> 13:00.382
If you need anything else,
just holler.

13:00.398 --> 13:03.502
My name's Zach, and, uh...
I'll be your waiter.

13:03.938 --> 13:05.670
- So you holding up okay?
- Oh yeah.

13:05.688 --> 13:08.611
I tell you, I was not looking forward
to this filling in for Lane deal.

13:08.628 --> 13:10.483
So I was all, "oh no",
and then she's like,

13:10.495 --> 13:13.001
"it's either this, or you fill in
during the whole childbirth deal."

13:13.038 --> 13:14.632
Which would probably be
a bit more difficult.

13:14.666 --> 13:16.382
Yeah, right.
Handing out food is cake

13:16.396 --> 13:18.781
compared to having a human being
come out of you -- no offense.

13:18.815 --> 13:20.652
None taken.
You're doing a good job.

13:20.667 --> 13:22.632
Oh, man, I got to tell you,
it's been great.

13:22.647 --> 13:24.243
I mean, it's been enlightening.

13:24.258 --> 13:27.710
Like, in the past,
I was the one sitting at the table,

13:27.726 --> 13:30.070
and now I'm the one with
the notepad and the pencil.

13:30.086 --> 13:31.641
- You're on the inside.
- It's cool.

13:31.657 --> 13:33.013
Don't let the power
go to your head.

13:33.048 --> 13:35.583
No kidding. You know what 
was freaking me out before?

13:35.596 --> 13:38.081
I'm about to hand people the
food they're going to eat,

13:38.096 --> 13:41.502
and I could do anything to it,
and they would have no idea.

13:41.518 --> 13:43.610
I mean, they would just eat it.

13:43.715 --> 13:47.412
Not that I would, of course,
but it's just intense.

13:47.426 --> 13:48.970
Plus, everything
smells so good.

13:48.986 --> 13:50.581
I can see why Lane
digs this job.

13:50.596 --> 13:52.901
Well, your enthusiasm
is appreciated.

13:52.915 --> 13:55.402
Right  on.
Hey, you have another rag?

13:55.718 --> 13:56.813
Cool.

13:57.026 --> 13:58.183
Hey, Luke?

13:58.195 --> 14:00.031
Hey, Babette.
What can I get you?

14:00.048 --> 14:01.980
You still stocking the
jungle with snacks,

14:01.997 --> 14:03.093
whatever that means?

14:03.148 --> 14:04.701
Luke, I got to tell
you something.

14:04.716 --> 14:07.573
Or, I don't know if I got to,
but I want to.

14:07.586 --> 14:10.091
It's not that I want to
like it's a good thing.

14:10.107 --> 14:12.542
Lorelai's dad had
a heart attack.

14:12.557 --> 14:14.501
- Oh, my god.
- Rory called Lorelai

14:14.518 --> 14:16.351
- and I was there.
- Is he okay?

14:16.366 --> 14:20.203
Well, he's not -- he's okay...
I think... right now.

14:20.215 --> 14:22.890
They're at John Skinner,
and I don't know... that's all I know.

14:22.907 --> 14:23.802
Oh, my god.

14:23.816 --> 14:26.022
Yeah, I-I thought you
would want to know.

14:26.037 --> 14:27.500
Yeah, yeah, thanks.

14:27.517 --> 14:29.623
All right. Well, I'm gonna go.

14:29.638 --> 14:31.322
Yeah. Thanks.

14:31.337 --> 14:32.681
You know what it's like?

14:32.697 --> 14:35.762
Working here is like having
a backstage pass at a show.

14:35.777 --> 14:37.421
It's all-access, man.

14:37.436 --> 14:38.890
Right. Right.

14:44.887 --> 14:46.701
Hey, it's me again.

14:46.716 --> 14:48.772
I don't know if you
got my other message.

14:49.005 --> 14:51.442
We're still here at the hospital,
and, uh...

14:51.455 --> 14:52.903
dad's gonna have surgery.

14:52.915 --> 14:55.373
He's having a coronary
bypass pretty soon.

14:55.387 --> 14:57.211
I just came from his room,

14:57.226 --> 14:59.552
and, um...
he doesn't look bad, you know?

14:59.568 --> 15:01.482
He looks okay, considering.

15:01.598 --> 15:04.383
But, uh... he's lying down.

15:04.397 --> 15:06.923
He just -- just looks so small.

15:07.118 --> 15:09.363
It just made me
think of this time.

15:09.626 --> 15:11.701
There was a tree in our
yard I would always climb,

15:11.717 --> 15:13.272
and one day, I climbed up really,
really high.

15:13.308 --> 15:16.083
Dad came home from work. I watched
him go into the house, and I thought,

15:16.115 --> 15:17.823
"he looks so small."

15:17.837 --> 15:20.581
It was so strange to
see him look like that.

15:21.736 --> 15:25.572
Anyway, I should go, but, uh...
call me when you get this, okay?

15:25.587 --> 15:27.550
Bye. Hello?

15:27.567 --> 15:29.813
How are you? How is everything?
What can I do?

15:29.827 --> 15:31.482
Oh no, it's okay. I'm okay.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.933
Dad had a heart attack,
and he's gonna have surgery.

15:33.946 --> 15:36.121
But I guess it's a pretty
common operation, so...

15:36.138 --> 15:37.131
And how are you?

15:37.147 --> 15:38.923
I'm okay, considering.

15:38.935 --> 15:41.552
- What can I do?
- Oh, nothing, hon. I'm fine.

15:41.568 --> 15:44.031
Can I send you anything?
I made lemon bars

15:44.046 --> 15:46.710
and, ooh, pecan squares,
and I packed them up

15:46.726 --> 15:48.643
and I'm sending them over
with Katie right now.

15:48.658 --> 15:50.281
Oh, that was so sweet.

15:50.296 --> 15:51.381
Is that Lorelai?

15:51.398 --> 15:53.450
Yes. Her dad's in surgery,
but he's fine.

15:53.465 --> 15:55.843
- How is Rory doing?
- Rory's doing fine, thanks.

15:55.858 --> 15:58.272
- Tell Lorelai I say hello.
- Michel says hello.

15:58.287 --> 16:00.352
- Tell Michel I said hello.
- She says hello.

16:00.365 --> 16:03.053
Tell Lorelai that I am thinking of
her father and wishing him well.

16:03.068 --> 16:05.090
He says he's thinking of your
father and wishing him well.

16:05.127 --> 16:07.111
- Tell Michel "thank you."
- She says "thank you."

16:07.128 --> 16:10.083
Tell Lorelai that the Zimmermans in
room 4 are not a married couple,

16:10.098 --> 16:12.371
as we had thought,
but rather a brother and a sister.

16:12.385 --> 16:14.580
No, I'm not telling Lorelai that.
She's in a hospital.

16:14.595 --> 16:17.953
Tell her they requested a rollaway bed,
and we do not have any rollaway bed left.

16:17.968 --> 16:20.042
I am not talking to Lorelai
about rollaway beds.

16:20.058 --> 16:22.141
Tell Lorelai that the Zimmermans
are very demanding, and very big,

16:22.176 --> 16:22.991
and they need a bed!

16:23.008 --> 16:24.603
Tell Michel that the Murrays
are checking out at 3:00

16:24.635 --> 16:26.591
and he can use the rolloway
bed from their room.

16:26.605 --> 16:28.530
She says you can take the
rollaway bed from the Murrays.

16:28.567 --> 16:29.880
They're checking out at 3:00.

16:29.898 --> 16:32.312
Ahh! Very good.
Tell her "thank you."

16:32.325 --> 16:34.943
He says "thank you" and
apologizes for being such a pest.

16:34.957 --> 16:37.903
Tell her I miss her here very,
very much!

16:37.915 --> 16:40.372
Well, then don't stick us in
the back corner next time.

16:40.385 --> 16:43.200
Oh, you did,
you absolutely did, Anthony.

16:43.217 --> 16:45.403
I was so close to the kitchen,
I could have reach

16:45.415 --> 16:46.910
and gotten my own plate
without standing up,

16:46.945 --> 16:49.621
just stretched out my arm
like Rubberman, and...

16:49.635 --> 16:51.590
No, no, I'm just kidding.

16:51.606 --> 16:53.631
So, tell me,
what's your special tonight?

16:53.908 --> 16:57.870
Sea scallops? Oh, you're torturing me,
Anthony, torturing me.

16:57.888 --> 16:59.551
Well, give my love
to your wife.

16:59.568 --> 17:00.990
Oh, I will.

17:01.007 --> 17:04.173
Oh, just one of those
last-minute business trips.

17:04.185 --> 17:06.190
All right, then. Bye-bye.

17:06.257 --> 17:08.083
Somebody's very
chipper on the phone.

17:08.096 --> 17:10.323
Somebody should consider a
career as a weather girl.

17:10.336 --> 17:13.413
Oh, please, I've spent years cultivating
my relationship with the maitre d'

17:13.425 --> 17:16.863
at Persephone's. I'm hardly about to
let it go down the drain in one night.

17:16.877 --> 17:18.742
"Call Persephone's" -- done.

17:18.755 --> 17:20.181
We're missing the sea scallops.

17:20.194 --> 17:23.290
Persephone's does the most
wonderful job with seafood.

17:23.305 --> 17:25.803
I wish we'd eaten there more often.
It's such a shame.

17:25.815 --> 17:28.540
They make a cedar-plank
salmon that is --

17:28.558 --> 17:29.851
I don't know if
you like salmon.

17:29.866 --> 17:32.381
No, but I love a nice,
juicy cedar plank.

17:32.398 --> 17:35.353
Salmon is one of the best fish
in terms of the omega-3s.

17:35.367 --> 17:39.573
It's absolutely marvelous for you,
and it makes your skin positively glow.

17:39.587 --> 17:42.682
Beauty tips are not really big on my
list of priorities right now, mom.

17:43.026 --> 17:44.281
So I tell Paris,

17:44.295 --> 17:46.691
"I don't care if it would
theoretically increase my chances

17:46.705 --> 17:48.700
of getting a grant
to study in Russia.

17:48.718 --> 17:52.060
I am not willing to pretend to be
an accomplished rhythmic gymnast."

17:52.078 --> 17:54.250
How do you pretend to be a
rhythmic gymnast, anyway?

17:54.268 --> 17:55.723
I don't even know.

17:55.736 --> 17:58.483
Do you whirl around some ribbons?
Balance a ball on your nose?

17:58.495 --> 18:02.551
She's taking the idea of our impending
graduation with a pinch of total insanity.

18:02.567 --> 18:04.623
- Logan you should answer that.
- Nah.

18:04.635 --> 18:07.123
But it's practically buzzing off
the table. Really, I don't mind.

18:07.156 --> 18:09.340
- I'll text them back in a minute.
- But you need to --

18:09.355 --> 18:13.122
Rory, right now, I don't need to do
anything but be right here with you.

18:13.908 --> 18:15.601
Well, are you sure?

18:15.616 --> 18:17.660
Aren't people gonna be mad
you're not answering your phone?

18:17.695 --> 18:19.563
Then that's their problem.

18:21.086 --> 18:23.803
You know who's gonna
be mad at me? Paris.

18:23.815 --> 18:26.172
Because right now,
I'm missing a G.R.E. prep course

18:26.187 --> 18:27.673
and tea with the
Branford librarian.

18:27.685 --> 18:29.503
I imagine she'll understand.

18:29.515 --> 18:30.492
Paris?

18:30.508 --> 18:32.512
Maybe you better start
balancing a ball on your nose.

18:32.548 --> 18:34.480
I need to cancel
Richard's tennis match.

18:34.495 --> 18:36.333
I guess I'm not gonna make
it to my book club tomorrow.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.573
Just as well --
I haven't even cracked the cover.

18:38.588 --> 18:41.032
Whatever gives Suzanna Shaw
the idea that the rest of us

18:41.046 --> 18:44.723
share her barbaric interest in
Cormac McCarthy is beyond me.

18:44.737 --> 18:47.751
Now let's see.
I need to return the Dean's call, and --

18:47.765 --> 18:50.260
Oh, no. Not him again.
What's he doing here?

18:50.276 --> 18:51.042
I don't know.

18:51.056 --> 18:52.631
Hey. I was just in the diner.

18:52.647 --> 18:55.023
Babette came and told me
your dad had a heart attack.

18:55.036 --> 18:57.061
I swear, I didn't even know
what I was doing.

18:57.078 --> 18:59.492
I just walked right out the
diner and drove straight here.

18:59.508 --> 19:01.422
Now that I'm here,
I realize I might be in the way,

19:01.455 --> 19:05.332
but if there's anything I can do,
I want to do it.

19:05.346 --> 19:07.052
- Uh... well --
- Hi, Luke.

19:07.066 --> 19:09.253
- Hey, Rory, Logan.
- Want some coffee?

19:09.265 --> 19:11.212
No, I'm okay. Thanks very much.

19:11.226 --> 19:14.153
Look, I don't want to cause
any kind of weirdness here.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.290
I mean,
I don't want to make him feel --

19:16.308 --> 19:18.681
Christopher actually isn't here yet,
but he will be any second, so...

19:18.716 --> 19:20.640
Okay, I'll just
get out of here.

19:20.657 --> 19:23.040
Thanks. There's just
not much for you to do.

19:23.057 --> 19:25.422
Oh, yes, there is, absolutely.
There is plenty for you to do, Luke.

19:25.458 --> 19:27.763
You can drive to the Yale campus
and pick up Richard's car.

19:27.797 --> 19:29.942
- Mom, he can't do that.
- No, it's no problem.

19:29.958 --> 19:32.841
I'm not exactly sure where it's parked,
but it shouldn't be hard to find.

19:32.877 --> 19:36.123
Just check the faculty parking lot
and wherever else they have parking.

19:36.137 --> 19:38.473
It's a 2006 Jaguar. It's green.

19:38.487 --> 19:41.801
Oh, and I think it's a little low
on gas, so if you wouldn't mind

19:41.815 --> 19:44.090
filling the tank, on the way back
to the house, that would be great.

19:44.128 --> 19:45.043
Okay. Sure.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.532
- Okay, I'll get the key.
- Mom...

19:46.545 --> 19:48.910
Is he supposed to just drive the
car to the house, and then what,

19:48.946 --> 19:50.921
then take a cab all the way
back to Yale to get his truck?

19:50.955 --> 19:53.472
- I have no objection to that.
- Seriously, it's no problem.

19:53.488 --> 19:56.300
See? Now fill it with premium,
not whatever sludge they try

19:56.317 --> 19:58.580
- to pass off as regular.
- Premium, you got it.

19:58.597 --> 20:00.560
You do know how to drive
a european car, don't you?

20:00.596 --> 20:02.522
- Mom.
- Absolutely. Don't worry.

20:02.538 --> 20:05.053
There's nothing to yank.
It's a Jaguar, not a lawn mower.

20:05.068 --> 20:06.093
Oh, my god!

20:06.105 --> 20:07.591
Just leave the
key with Soledad.

20:07.608 --> 20:09.611
And... here.
You can keep the change.

20:09.626 --> 20:11.901
Emily, thanks, really,
it's my pleasure.

20:11.916 --> 20:14.213
If you insist.
If you don't mind terribly,

20:14.226 --> 20:17.590
I need someone to make sure that the
path to the front door is shoveled.

20:17.608 --> 20:19.361
Mother, stop.

20:21.765 --> 20:23.152
Hello?

20:23.165 --> 20:25.951
Oh, hello.
You got my message about the fish.

20:26.046 --> 20:27.641
Sorry. We're all a little...

20:27.658 --> 20:30.021
She read an article about how
fish can prevent heart attacks.

20:30.057 --> 20:31.762
Now she thinks it's
the key to everything.

20:31.778 --> 20:33.873
Well, fish is good.

20:33.885 --> 20:34.720
Yeah.

20:34.737 --> 20:36.380
All right, I should get going.

20:36.398 --> 20:38.473
Okay. Well, thanks.

20:39.677 --> 20:41.432
Yes! Goodbye!

20:41.445 --> 20:44.073
Another incompetent.
Lorelai, go get Luke back.

20:44.087 --> 20:45.821
I need him to bring a
check for the fish man.

20:45.858 --> 20:47.763
Mom, I'm not getting Luke.
He's done enough already.

20:47.797 --> 20:49.541
Why don't you reschedule the
fish man for later in the week.

20:49.575 --> 20:50.792
Because this is important.

20:50.805 --> 20:52.722
It's important to have fish
at the house right now?

20:52.755 --> 20:55.523
Logan and I can go meet the fish
man with a check if you want.

20:55.538 --> 20:56.870
Oh, that would be marvelous.

20:56.887 --> 20:59.820
Okay. I also want to get some of grandpa's
stuff so he has it when he wakes up.

20:59.857 --> 21:01.263
- Wait, I'll do that.
- Do what?

21:01.295 --> 21:03.003
You pay the fish man,
and I'll get grandpa's stuff.

21:03.035 --> 21:04.783
Oh mom, that's silly.
They're in the same place.

21:04.815 --> 21:06.982
Yes, but then we'll both have a job.
You have a job and I have a job.

21:07.015 --> 21:09.012
Yeah, but going to
grandpa's is one job.

21:09.026 --> 21:11.422
Somebody needs to stay here
and look after grandma.

21:11.435 --> 21:12.573
Fine.

21:12.586 --> 21:14.722
- I mean, if you really want --
- No, she's my mother.

21:14.738 --> 21:17.250
- Well, you're my mother.
- Exactly. It's a tangled web.

21:17.267 --> 21:18.520
Here you go, Logan.

21:18.536 --> 21:21.032
Now have him put the salmon,
the swordfish, the king mackerel,

21:21.048 --> 21:23.412
and the tuna in the
downstairs freezer

21:23.427 --> 21:26.931
and the trout, sea bass, snapper,
and bluefish in the butler's pantry.

21:26.948 --> 21:29.340
Salmon, swordfish,
king mackerel, tuna downstairs.

21:29.358 --> 21:31.831
Trout, sea bass, snapper,
bluefish upstairs.

21:31.846 --> 21:34.730
If you rode in the ambulance,
you and I don't have a car here.

21:34.748 --> 21:36.843
Take it before I change my mind.
Level 3.

21:36.856 --> 21:37.852
Thanks. Bye.

21:37.866 --> 21:39.381
Bye. I'll be here doing my job.

21:39.397 --> 21:40.470
How come you don't have a car?

21:40.506 --> 21:42.321
Well, I came by
chopper, actually.

21:42.338 --> 21:44.243
Chopper motorcycle or
chopper helicopter?

21:44.258 --> 21:45.022
Helicopter.

21:45.035 --> 21:47.242
- You came here in a helicopter?
- Yep.

21:47.516 --> 21:51.180
Oh, I do need to call Quentin. I wonder
if they have a fax machine here.

21:51.197 --> 21:52.792
And I'm hungry. Are you hungry?

21:52.807 --> 21:55.652
I don't know. Probably.
I should be. Don't feel hungry.

21:55.665 --> 21:57.710
All right. Then we should get something
to eat. But first, I want to see

21:57.745 --> 22:01.550
if those addled nurses will allow
me to use their fax machine.

22:11.175 --> 22:12.000
Hello?

22:12.018 --> 22:14.042
Lorelai, it's me -- Babette.

22:14.056 --> 22:16.273
- How you doing, sweetie?
- Oh, hey. I'm okay.

22:16.287 --> 22:17.590
What's the news with your dad?

22:17.608 --> 22:20.210
Well, he's in surgery right now,
but we think he's gonna be okay.

22:20.227 --> 22:22.573
Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
Don't you worry about a thing.

22:22.588 --> 22:25.202
He's a very vital man, your dad --
lots of chi, you know?

22:25.217 --> 22:27.683
Oh... really?
I didn't know you noticed his chi.

22:27.695 --> 22:30.030
Are you kidding me?
Prana, chi, life force --

22:30.047 --> 22:32.602
whatever you call it,
your daddy's got it in spades.

22:32.618 --> 22:35.432
Sexy men like him often do.
That's what makes them so sexy.

22:35.445 --> 22:37.550
- They're ripe with life.
- O-kay.

22:37.566 --> 22:40.032
- He's gonna be fine.
- Thanks, Babette.

22:40.047 --> 22:43.312
He's like Warren Beatty, your dad --
or Sean Connery

22:43.325 --> 22:45.852
or -- who's that one
I always found so sexy?

22:45.866 --> 22:49.003
The evil politician with the glasses --
Henry Kissinger!

22:49.017 --> 22:50.230
Oh, yeah, I know him.

22:50.248 --> 22:52.981
You might not agree with his politics.
You might have lived through Vietnam

22:53.016 --> 22:54.891
and thought,
"that man is the devil,"

22:54.906 --> 22:57.992
but you can't deny he's sexy.
You know why? Chi.

22:58.008 --> 22:59.930
I get it. So, how's Paul Anka?

22:59.948 --> 23:02.721
Oh, yeah, he's great,
just great.

23:02.736 --> 23:03.602
What's wrong?

23:03.616 --> 23:06.033
- I don't want to bother you.
- Go ahead.

23:06.045 --> 23:08.670
Oh, nothing to worry about.
It's just...

23:08.687 --> 23:10.680
I'm afraid his
bladder's gonna explode.

23:10.696 --> 23:12.610
I can't get him
to come with me.

23:12.628 --> 23:16.292
I'm sure he needs to relieve himself,
but it's a no-go. He's a no-go.

23:16.306 --> 23:18.571
Oh Babette, I should've told you,
he's probably afraid of the porch steps.

23:18.608 --> 23:20.232
You just have to lay
something down for him.

23:20.265 --> 23:22.282
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

23:28.506 --> 23:31.050
Wow! Yeah,
that worked great. Wow.

23:31.067 --> 23:33.321
He's got some chi of his own,
this one.

23:33.337 --> 23:35.201
- Ooh. Only problem is...
- What?

23:35.218 --> 23:38.441
Nothing, nothing. It's just a little
cold without my coat, that's all.

23:38.456 --> 23:39.811
Not your concern.

23:39.828 --> 23:42.602
So, sweetie, if you need anything else,
you'll call me?

23:42.617 --> 23:44.230
- Okay, I'll call you.
- Okay.

23:44.247 --> 23:45.631
Give my love to your father.

23:45.647 --> 23:48.052
I will, Babette.
Hey, thanks for calling.

23:48.065 --> 23:49.983
Oh, sure thing, hon. Bye.

23:49.997 --> 23:51.760
Uh-huh, right.

23:52.075 --> 23:54.390
No, it's not a problem. It's perfectly
understandable. So from there,

23:54.428 --> 23:57.523
you wanna take a right on Sycamore,
left onto old Sawbrook, and then...

23:57.538 --> 23:58.821
That's right.

23:58.837 --> 24:02.181
No, I mean a left into the driveway.
I mean that's correct --

24:02.197 --> 24:05.063
making a left.
I mean, a left is the correct choice.

24:05.077 --> 24:06.062
Right.

24:06.075 --> 24:07.683
That's correct, I mean.

24:07.697 --> 24:10.683
Okay, great. Great.
We'll be here. See you soon.

24:10.898 --> 24:14.042
Sounds like Abbott and Costello got
nothing on you and the fish man.

24:14.056 --> 24:16.481
You liked the "right/right" business?
It could use polish,

24:16.495 --> 24:18.593
but me and the fish man have
plans to bring back vaudeville.

24:18.628 --> 24:21.181
Oh, I'm gonna book the Palace
Theater. Logan and the fish man.

24:21.187 --> 24:22.950
- The fish man and Logan.
- He gets top billing?

24:22.985 --> 24:24.421
He's the one who can juggle.

24:24.438 --> 24:27.440
Anyway, so the snow delayed him,
but he should be here in 15 minutes.

24:27.455 --> 24:29.513
Okay, I think your Blackberry
is going to explode.

24:29.528 --> 24:31.753
It's business stuff --
nothing that can't keep.

24:31.765 --> 24:33.133
Business stuff, huh?

24:33.148 --> 24:35.930
Business stuff that has to do
with the chopper you flew in on?

24:35.945 --> 24:37.541
We don't have to
talk about it now.

24:37.558 --> 24:40.450
Oh, come on, I'm interested.
I want to know.

24:40.466 --> 24:42.933
And also,
I could really use the distraction.

24:42.948 --> 24:45.350
Besides, I want to make sure
you haven't stolen a chopper.

24:45.366 --> 24:47.980
I didn't steal it. It was loaned
to me by a hedge-fund manager.

24:47.996 --> 24:48.743
Ohh, well...

24:48.755 --> 24:51.930
I was at his country home in Montauk
when you called, and he just...

24:51.945 --> 24:53.660
Loaned you his chopper,
as they say.

24:53.677 --> 24:54.613
Pretty much.

24:54.627 --> 24:57.162
Well, I think loaning
someone your chopper

24:57.176 --> 24:59.722
is a sign of trust
in many cultures.

24:59.735 --> 25:01.002
That sounds like a good sign.

25:01.015 --> 25:02.703
Yeah, I think it
is a good sign.

25:02.718 --> 25:04.650
So, come on.
What do you need funding for?

25:04.668 --> 25:06.823
Just tell me something.
I don't want to be nosy,

25:06.838 --> 25:08.832
but I'm really interested.
Come on. Come on.

25:08.847 --> 25:12.482
Okay, you asked for
it so here it goes.

25:12.497 --> 25:14.202
I want to buy another
internet company.

25:14.218 --> 25:15.110
I see.

25:15.125 --> 25:18.190
It's a web-based, interactive-media
platform. This guy in Austin created it

25:18.206 --> 25:21.460
and it's amazing, fast,
and so easy to use, even I can use it.

25:21.475 --> 25:23.680
The idea is to build on
the web presence we have

25:23.695 --> 25:26.672
and turn into a user-generated
media hub where the members can

25:26.687 --> 25:29.142
share videos, articles,
ideas, anything.

25:29.157 --> 25:30.452
That sounds like a good idea.

25:30.465 --> 25:32.180
Yeah, and it's a deal, too.

25:32.195 --> 25:34.951
The guy who created this platform
is such a true blue computer geek,

25:34.968 --> 25:37.223
he just wants to get started on his
next project, so he's willing to sell

25:37.258 --> 25:39.450
- for only $5 million.
- Oh, only.

25:39.468 --> 25:42.121
I know. I know. But in this world,
that's relatively cheap.

25:42.135 --> 25:46.082
Chad Hurley and Steve Chen sold
Youtube for $1.65 billion,

25:46.098 --> 25:48.353
and who knows how much Mark
Zuckerberg will get for facebook?

25:48.386 --> 25:49.963
Yeah, comparatively.

25:49.976 --> 25:52.933
Anyway, so I'm planning on putting
up $3 million of my own money.

25:52.947 --> 25:55.531
And I'm just trying to line up a fund
to kick in the other $2 million.

25:55.567 --> 25:56.612
You have $3 million?

25:56.627 --> 25:57.683
Yeah, in my trust fund.

25:57.697 --> 25:59.083
Yeah, but I thought this
was a business thing.

25:59.115 --> 26:01.360
I mean, haven't you asked your dad?
I thought you were working for him.

26:01.397 --> 26:03.850
I went to him. I pitched him the idea,
and he rejected it.

26:03.868 --> 26:06.521
I have to move fast. I have to
take this deal off the market

26:06.536 --> 26:09.502
before one of the big-dog companies
sniff me out and try to outbid me.

26:09.516 --> 26:10.942
You still want to take
this chess thing?

26:10.976 --> 26:12.520
Yeah, we should.

26:13.225 --> 26:15.293
Well, you sound really excited.

26:15.308 --> 26:16.873
I am. It's exciting.

26:16.887 --> 26:18.552
The economies of
scale are incredible.

26:18.568 --> 26:20.372
I just need to prove out
the business model first.

26:20.408 --> 26:22.841
Yeah, and the barriers to switching
for your current clientele

26:22.877 --> 26:24.090
will probably increase, too.

26:24.108 --> 26:26.263
Yeah exactly.
That what my father doesn't understand.

26:26.278 --> 26:28.830
The opportunity cost of not doing
it is that somebody else will,

26:28.838 --> 26:30.660
and the barriers
to switching --

26:30.675 --> 26:32.531
- Hey.
- What?

26:32.546 --> 26:35.630
Are you using business-speak with me?
Are we speaking businessese?

26:35.645 --> 26:36.663
I believe we are.

26:36.676 --> 26:37.910
Color me impressed.

26:37.926 --> 26:39.492
I take economics.

26:39.505 --> 26:40.963
Sure, with professor Gilmore.

26:40.976 --> 26:44.310
Yeah. We learned about ideal
business theory last semester.

26:44.325 --> 26:46.672
I'm actualy really enjoying his class.
I've learned a lot.

26:46.686 --> 26:49.081
He's a really good teacher,
which isn't always a given, you know.

26:49.117 --> 26:52.322
Some smart people can't translate
their smarts to other people,

26:52.337 --> 26:54.460
but he is really good
at explaining things,

26:54.477 --> 26:56.002
and he makes you
want to learn more.

26:56.015 --> 26:58.263
Like next week,
we're gonna split up into 10 groups,

26:58.278 --> 27:00.232
and each of us have to
create a business plan.

27:00.246 --> 27:01.583
- Like "The Apprentice."
- Yeah.

27:01.596 --> 27:04.991
And he's gonna be like Donald Trump,
which is ridiculous.

27:05.196 --> 27:08.731
Actually, we don't know what's
gonna go on next week, do we?

27:08.747 --> 27:10.431
I guess not.

27:10.888 --> 27:13.843
But it's good --
you got him a bunch of stuff to read.

27:15.395 --> 27:17.531
I can hardly tell
what anything is.

27:17.545 --> 27:19.291
Look at that pale,
misshapen thing.

27:19.305 --> 27:20.981
Is that a sandwich or
a piece of chicken?

27:20.996 --> 27:22.392
Maybe it's a chicken sandwich.

27:22.407 --> 27:23.612
Oh no, it's quiche.

27:23.627 --> 27:24.940
That's a quiche?

27:24.955 --> 27:27.782
That blobby, white thing is
supposedly quiche lorraine?

27:27.795 --> 27:30.333
It doesn't say "quiche lorraine."
Maybe it's "quiche blobby white thing."

27:30.366 --> 27:32.330
The audacity of charging
money for this.

27:32.346 --> 27:33.523
It's hospital food.

27:33.536 --> 27:34.580
What's that supposed to mean?

27:34.617 --> 27:35.682
I'm just saying it's a cliché.

27:35.716 --> 27:36.590
What is?

27:36.606 --> 27:37.860
Hospital food being bad.

27:37.878 --> 27:39.560
- Exactly.
- What?

27:39.575 --> 27:42.440
It's a cliché for a reason.
Clichés are true things

27:42.455 --> 27:44.331
that people are
tired of being true.

27:44.347 --> 27:47.722
Like, "a penny saved is a penny
earned." Well it is, invested wisely.

27:47.737 --> 27:49.062
I don't think that's
a cliché, mom.

27:49.096 --> 27:50.562
What do you mean?
Of course it's a cliché.

27:50.595 --> 27:53.182
It's not a cliché.
That's more an overused saying, like

27:53.198 --> 27:55.590
"I'm sweating bullets" or
"it's as cold as ice."

27:55.608 --> 27:57.441
Some overused sayings are true,

27:57.458 --> 27:59.590
like "children should
be seen and not heard."

27:59.607 --> 28:01.001
"Mother knows best."

28:01.018 --> 28:03.933
"If you don't have anything nice to say,
don't say anything at all."

28:06.777 --> 28:08.083
Hello?

28:08.108 --> 28:10.471
Oh, Quentin, hello.

28:11.445 --> 28:14.130
No, I'm not busy at all.
You haven't interrupted a thing.

28:14.148 --> 28:16.751
Thank you for returning
my call so promptly.

28:16.768 --> 28:19.051
Oh, that's very kind, Quentin.

28:19.065 --> 28:21.090
That's right. Yes.

28:21.106 --> 28:23.453
Oh, I'm fine, thank you.

28:23.466 --> 28:26.890
Listen, it's been a while since
I've seen some of the paperwork.

28:26.905 --> 28:30.663
I was wondering if you could fax some
things over here to the hospital.

28:30.676 --> 28:33.223
I think I have
access to a machine.

28:33.238 --> 28:35.852
The first thing I'd like
you to fax is his will.

28:35.865 --> 28:39.023
That's right -- both the standard
will and the living will.

28:39.035 --> 28:42.892
Well, I'm not sure about the
DNR provisions he established.

28:42.955 --> 28:45.411
Oh, that would be wonderful.
Thank you, Quentin.

28:45.427 --> 28:46.903
Talk to you soon. Bye.

28:47.816 --> 28:49.411
Mom, what was that?

28:49.426 --> 28:52.853
Do we like this table, or is it too
close to that man with the I.V.?

28:52.868 --> 28:55.402
Honestly, shouldn't there be a
separate dining area for sick people?

28:55.437 --> 28:56.391
That doesn't seem right.

28:56.407 --> 28:59.321
Mother, you're getting
dad's will faxed here?

28:59.338 --> 29:00.191
Yes.

29:00.205 --> 29:02.433
Why? You need to
read it right now?

29:02.448 --> 29:03.241
Well, yes.

29:03.257 --> 29:05.670
You want to make sure he left
you the Mercedes and the Jag?

29:05.686 --> 29:08.301
I don't care what you think.
I'm being pragmatic.

29:08.316 --> 29:11.132
You know what?
I'm not hungry anymore.

29:18.086 --> 29:20.252
- You like that, right?
- Yeah, that's a good one.

29:20.265 --> 29:22.243
Yeah, all right.

29:23.298 --> 29:26.312
Here's this.
I also found a bunch of his albums --

29:26.325 --> 29:28.130
Bobby Short singing
Cole Porter,

29:28.145 --> 29:29.911
a couple of his favorite
Gershwin ones --

29:29.925 --> 29:32.341
"Rhapsody in blue" and
"An american in Paris" --

29:32.357 --> 29:35.291
also a couple of
Scott Joplin records,

29:35.306 --> 29:37.950
although Scott Joplin might be a
little zazzly for the hospital.

29:37.967 --> 29:40.560
Yeah, I don't know what their
policy about ragtime is.

29:40.578 --> 29:43.323
Oh, I also found "Chuck
Berry at the Fillmore,"

29:43.335 --> 29:45.841
which I gave him for
his 60th birthday.

29:45.856 --> 29:49.350
Also, a little Schubert and Debussy,
which should be nice and relaxing.

29:49.366 --> 29:51.752
Although I didn't find the
Bing Crosby album I wanted.

29:51.766 --> 29:54.240
It's with his son Gary.
It's this song called

29:54.256 --> 29:56.791
"When you and I were young, Maggie
blues." And when grandpa hears it,

29:56.828 --> 29:59.740
he sings along and says,
"I always wanted to be a crooner."

29:59.758 --> 30:01.232
Maggie blues?
You want me to help you look?

30:01.266 --> 30:03.823
Well, I looked. I looked in
two closets and under a couch,

30:03.838 --> 30:05.463
and all I found was the sleeve.

30:05.478 --> 30:08.692
I mean, I could take it just for
decoration, but then it might underline

30:08.708 --> 30:10.282
the fact that we don't
have "Maggie blues."

30:10.316 --> 30:11.801
- I'd bring it.
- Yeah?

30:11.818 --> 30:14.511
Yeah. So the fish man successfully
unloaded all the fish

30:14.528 --> 30:15.933
per your grandmother's request.

30:15.945 --> 30:17.771
Oh good. And everything
worked out with the check?

30:17.806 --> 30:20.543
Yep, the fish man was happy because
I laughed at his C.O.D. joke.

30:20.556 --> 30:24.113
- Hmm?
- C-O-D -- Cod.

30:24.498 --> 30:26.343
Yeah, just like that.

30:26.356 --> 30:28.101
That fish man,
he's a funny one.

30:28.116 --> 30:30.563
Believe me, I know.
I'm Hardy to his Laurel.

30:30.577 --> 30:33.321
Okay, we have a deck of cards,
we have the chessboard.

30:33.336 --> 30:35.360
We have what I think
is a backgammon set.

30:35.378 --> 30:37.591
I grabbed grandma two outfits,

30:37.605 --> 30:39.803
I grabbed her a pair of pants because
I wanted her to be comfortable,

30:39.838 --> 30:41.852
but then I thought that
might be offensive to her.

30:41.865 --> 30:43.861
- Offensive how?
- I have no idea.

30:43.878 --> 30:47.571
Then I grabbed a skirt, but that opened
up the whole stockings, pantyhose,

30:47.585 --> 30:49.752
"going through my grandma's
underwear drawer" can of worms.

30:49.787 --> 30:52.963
And each outfit needs a different
top and a different pair of shoes.

30:52.977 --> 30:54.711
Do you want to know who
rivals Imelda Marcos?

30:54.746 --> 30:56.662
- Emily Gilmore?
- It's unbelievable.

30:56.678 --> 30:58.953
No biped needs to have
that many pairs of shoes.

30:58.965 --> 31:00.810
Do you know what else
I wanted to grab?

31:00.828 --> 31:03.432
By grandpa's bed,
there is a bookmarked copy

31:03.448 --> 31:05.102
of "A monetary history
of the United States."

31:05.136 --> 31:06.842
Because who doesn't
love Milton Friedman?

31:06.858 --> 31:09.671
Milton Friedman's on the syllabus,
so I thought maybe he'd want it.

31:09.687 --> 31:11.520
- Hey!
- What's that?

31:11.538 --> 31:13.640
Bing Crosby and Gary Crosby.

31:13.658 --> 31:14.602
Oh, no way!

31:14.616 --> 31:16.111
It was in the wrong sleeve.

31:16.126 --> 31:17.691
He can croon with
"Maggie blues."

31:17.707 --> 31:18.811
Oh, perfect.

31:18.828 --> 31:20.562
All right, I'm gonna start
loading this stuff in the car.

31:20.595 --> 31:21.803
Okay.

31:22.566 --> 31:24.231
- Logan?
- Yes?

31:24.246 --> 31:26.581
Thank you.
Thank you so much for everything.

31:26.596 --> 31:28.443
Of course.
But you don't have to thank me.

31:28.456 --> 31:30.553
There's nowhere
else I'd rather be.

31:37.516 --> 31:40.282
There you are.
I've been looking for you everywhere.

31:40.295 --> 31:42.462
- Oh, yeah?
- I just got these faxed --

31:42.476 --> 31:44.043
Mom, please, can we drop this?

31:44.057 --> 31:46.141
I need to verify your
social-security number.

31:46.158 --> 31:48.200
I don't want to give you my
social-security number right now.

31:48.236 --> 31:49.992
Why don't you help me pick
out a little gift for dad.

31:50.025 --> 31:52.631
What do you think I'm trying to do,
run a con, steal your identity?

31:52.665 --> 31:55.093
No mom, I've just had enough of
talking about social securities

31:55.127 --> 31:56.512
and wills, okay?

31:56.527 --> 31:59.630
Your father's lawyer faxed
these over from the bank,

31:59.646 --> 32:01.270
and I need your
social-security number.

32:01.285 --> 32:02.832
You have got to be kidding me.

32:02.845 --> 32:03.923
What would I be kidding about?

32:03.958 --> 32:06.583
You're acting like dad is dead.
Dad is not dead.

32:06.597 --> 32:09.391
Lorelai, six years ago,
when your father was in the hospital,

32:09.405 --> 32:11.151
we were completely unprepared,

32:11.167 --> 32:13.781
and we agreed to never
let that happen again.

32:13.798 --> 32:14.993
So we made a plan,

32:15.008 --> 32:17.372
and I am simply following
through on the plan.

32:17.387 --> 32:20.393
So your plan was to chat up
Persephone's to make sure

32:20.405 --> 32:22.402
you don't lose your
special table and to order

32:22.418 --> 32:26.233
tons of swordfish and salmon
to keep your skin glowing

32:26.248 --> 32:29.093
and to happily
discuss with Quentin

32:29.107 --> 32:31.070
whether or not dad
should be resuscitated?

32:31.085 --> 32:33.261
These are things that
need to be dealt with.

32:33.278 --> 32:35.770
No, what has to be dealt with
is that dad could be dying.

32:35.785 --> 32:38.211
What you're dealing with is
phone calls and a checklist.

32:38.228 --> 32:40.243
You're not his secretary, mom.
You're his wife.

32:40.258 --> 32:42.813
Yes. And what do you
know about being a wife?

32:42.826 --> 32:45.301
You've been married for what --
40 days? That's nothing.

32:45.315 --> 32:47.743
Your father and I have been
married for over 40 years.

32:47.757 --> 32:51.092
For 2/3 of my life,
I have been the wife of Richard Gilmore.

32:51.108 --> 32:53.280
I run his household.
I plan his meals.

32:53.296 --> 32:56.372
I buy his clothes,
I entertain his business associates.

32:56.386 --> 32:58.572
When he loses his reading glasses,
I find them.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.560
When he wants a nightcap.
I make it for him.

33:00.576 --> 33:02.900
If he can't remember the
name of a colleague's wife,

33:02.917 --> 33:04.311
I whisper it in his ear.

33:04.328 --> 33:06.430
That's what I do --
I take care of him.

33:06.447 --> 33:08.231
That's my job. That's who I am.

33:08.246 --> 33:11.510
If I could be performing his surgery
right now, I would be, but I can't --

33:11.526 --> 33:13.072
it's out of my hands.

33:13.085 --> 33:16.722
It's out of my hands,
and there's nothing I can do but wait.

33:17.237 --> 33:20.041
I could lose him, Lorelai.

33:20.338 --> 33:22.552
He's my whole life,

33:22.707 --> 33:25.241
and there's nothing I can do!

33:25.315 --> 33:26.602
Mom.

33:26.616 --> 33:28.820
I'm sorry.
This is inappropriate.

33:28.835 --> 33:30.961
No, it's not. It's fine.

33:30.978 --> 33:32.752
Oh, god, I'm a mess.

33:39.537 --> 33:41.151
Did you just take those?

33:41.168 --> 33:43.271
Don't worry about it.
Pay for it later.

33:47.538 --> 33:49.062
Just a few more?

33:49.738 --> 33:50.920
They're good, right?

33:50.938 --> 33:52.730
They stick in your teeth.

33:52.785 --> 33:54.701
But, yes, they are good.

33:54.718 --> 33:55.831
Are there any more?

33:55.847 --> 33:57.163
Are you kidding? There's a ton.

33:57.175 --> 33:59.883
- Not too many.
- Oh mom, there's no such thing.

33:59.995 --> 34:01.890
I wonder why they
call them "Duds."

34:01.906 --> 34:03.162
I don't know. Do you guys know?

34:03.177 --> 34:03.932
Nope.

34:03.948 --> 34:05.652
I could make something up,
but no.

34:05.845 --> 34:09.032
Seems a rather counterintuitive
name for a type of candy.

34:09.045 --> 34:12.763
So, he's out of surgery,
and it went extremely well.

34:12.777 --> 34:14.183
His recovery won't
be immediate.

34:14.197 --> 34:16.243
He still has several days
here at the hospital.

34:16.257 --> 34:20.201
But we can go over that later.
He's groggy now and tired.

34:20.217 --> 34:22.431
After he gets some rest,
you can all visit with him, but for now,

34:22.466 --> 34:24.663
maybe just his wife.

34:25.315 --> 34:26.862
Thank you, doctor.

34:26.878 --> 34:28.353
Tell dad "hi" from us, mom.

34:28.366 --> 34:29.893
I will, Lorelai.

34:38.534 --> 34:41.822
Everything's in order, you'll be
glad to know. I called Harold Larkin

34:41.837 --> 34:44.021
and the chairman of the
economics department.

34:44.036 --> 34:46.951
They both send their best
wishes for a speedy recovery.

34:46.967 --> 34:49.822
I canceled our dinner reservations
for the next couple of weeks.

34:49.835 --> 34:52.150
Oh, and I sent regrets
to Sarah Osgood,

34:52.166 --> 34:55.150
who's hosting the D.A.R.
spring fling this year.

34:55.168 --> 34:59.612
I left word for the Sudburys that we
won't be able to host bridge this week.

34:59.656 --> 35:01.100
Uh, what else?

35:01.117 --> 35:03.262
Oh, and I've been in
touch with Quentin.

35:03.276 --> 35:05.472
He's been kept abreast
of the whole situation.

35:05.485 --> 35:08.542
And I bought fish,
Richard, so much fish --

35:08.558 --> 35:12.132
Tuna and trout and
snapper and salmon and --

35:12.148 --> 35:14.102
Sounds just fine, Emily.

35:14.267 --> 35:16.782
That sounds just fine.

35:31.446 --> 35:34.643
Hi, it's me -- again.
Um, dad's out of surgery,

35:34.657 --> 35:38.622
and it went well,
and he's doing fine, so...

35:39.038 --> 35:43.350
It's good news. I just --
I wanted you to know...

35:43.638 --> 35:45.750
because... I don't know why.

35:45.765 --> 35:47.723
'Cause you haven't
returned any of my calls.

35:47.735 --> 35:52.201
But I just thought I would,
uh, tell you what's going on

35:52.215 --> 35:56.031
because... I'm your wife and...

35:56.127 --> 35:58.482
I think that's what
I'm supposed to do.

35:58.497 --> 36:00.862
No idea how to be your wife,
but I'm trying.

36:00.878 --> 36:03.091
You're my husband,
you know, and...

36:03.106 --> 36:05.453
it seems like you should
be here or call me back.

36:05.466 --> 36:08.410
I mean, I'm pretty sure that's
what married people do,

36:08.426 --> 36:09.850
is be there for each other.

36:09.867 --> 36:12.423
But I know you're upset,
and I know we had a fight,

36:12.436 --> 36:14.263
but this is just bigger than that,
you know?

36:14.276 --> 36:16.941
It's my dad,
and he's had a heart attack.

36:16.957 --> 36:18.890
and everybody's been here.

36:18.905 --> 36:22.443
I mean, I've talked to Sookie and
even Michel and Patty and Babette,

36:22.457 --> 36:25.243
and they've all been
here for me, but...

36:27.007 --> 36:30.980
my husband's... not here.

36:32.306 --> 36:34.331
That's not okay,
Chris, you know?

36:34.347 --> 36:35.852
It's not okay.

36:40.338 --> 36:42.172
Here we go --

36:42.627 --> 36:44.731
a little "Maggie blues."

36:53.475 --> 36:56.401
That is Bing and Gary Crosby.

36:56.415 --> 36:58.312
Why doesn't anybody name
their kid "Bing" anymore?

36:58.346 --> 36:59.230
You could have named me "Bing."

36:59.267 --> 37:00.670
I thought about it.
You didn't look like a Bing.

37:00.707 --> 37:02.132
I don't even know if
I should be insulted.

37:02.167 --> 37:04.193
I wish I were a crooner.

37:05.736 --> 37:07.652
I also brought
you some Gershwin,

37:07.665 --> 37:09.503
some Chuck Berry,
and the Andrews sisters.

37:09.515 --> 37:11.332
Ooh, and some Milton Friedman.

37:11.346 --> 37:12.952
The guy who sang
"Spirit in the sky"?

37:12.968 --> 37:15.332
No, that was Norman Greenbaum.

37:15.345 --> 37:18.913
No, Milton Friedman's the economist
who won the Nobel prize in the '70.

37:18.927 --> 37:21.113
I figured, when you're sick of
reading sir Arthur Conan Doyle,

37:21.148 --> 37:23.301
you can pick up a little
Friedman for a real mystery

37:23.318 --> 37:27.842
and deduce the disadvantages of government
intervention in economic policy.

37:28.825 --> 37:31.073
What do you say, dad --
here or Philadelphia?

37:31.088 --> 37:32.233
What's the call?

37:32.247 --> 37:35.381
I don't think I'd like
to be in Philadelphia.

37:35.395 --> 37:37.351
I think I'd rather
be in New Haven.

37:37.368 --> 37:38.622
Yeah, it's okay here.

37:38.635 --> 37:40.802
We can import cream
cheese and cheesesteaks

37:40.818 --> 37:42.993
and any other kind of cheese.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.192
You look good, dad.

37:45.205 --> 37:48.530
This outfit's not up to your usual J.
Press standards,

37:48.545 --> 37:51.761
unless it's got some brass
buttons I can't see, but...

37:51.778 --> 37:53.230
you look good.

37:53.248 --> 37:55.120
You look tall.

37:55.818 --> 37:57.713
I think I'm just gonna...

37:57.908 --> 38:00.231
close my eyes for...

38:01.498 --> 38:03.362
just a little minute.

38:06.085 --> 38:07.401
Is he asleep?

38:07.417 --> 38:08.883
I think so.

38:09.005 --> 38:11.003
Should we draw a
mustache on him?

38:11.018 --> 38:13.563
- He's already got a mustache.
- Oh, yeah.

38:14.268 --> 38:17.213
- The music's nice.
- Yeah, it is, isn't it?

38:19.037 --> 38:20.323
Hey, Rory?

38:20.346 --> 38:21.671
Hey, mom?

38:21.708 --> 38:24.172
You know, I'm glad to see
you doing so well with Logan.

38:24.185 --> 38:25.573
I'm happy that you're happy.

38:25.586 --> 38:27.002
Thanks.

38:27.778 --> 38:30.311
He's not half bad, that kid.
He's almost okay.

38:30.328 --> 38:31.891
Yeah, he's all right.

38:34.498 --> 38:37.383
- Hey, uh, mom?
- Hey, uh, Rory?

38:37.397 --> 38:40.421
Um, do you...
know where dad is?

38:41.698 --> 38:43.102
No, hon.

38:43.828 --> 38:47.191
For all I know,
maybe he's in Philadelphia.

38:48.665 --> 38:52.060
So we should be able to move him
out of the C.I.C.U. in 24 hours.

38:52.076 --> 38:55.071
If everything goes as planned,
he should be home in five or six days.

38:55.088 --> 38:56.952
Everything will go as planned.
I'm sure of it.

38:56.967 --> 38:59.863
If you like, I can show you the room
where we'll be moving Richard tomorrow.

38:59.896 --> 39:01.762
Absolutely. Does
it have a window?

39:01.775 --> 39:04.440
The room he's in has a window so small,
it's almost a peephole.

39:04.456 --> 39:06.773
I believe it does
have a window.

39:06.906 --> 39:09.433
- Go ahead. I'll be right there.
- Okay, mom.

39:09.888 --> 39:13.462
Just be careful of this bag here,
'cause it's leaking a little bit.

39:13.478 --> 39:14.490
Hey, you're back.

39:14.508 --> 39:17.332
Oh. Hey.
I didn't want to bug you.

39:17.346 --> 39:20.170
I just wanted to drop off some
food for you guys and get going.

39:20.188 --> 39:21.543
Luke, you didn't
have to do that.

39:21.555 --> 39:25.811
It's all right. I wanted to
make some stuff anyway, so...

39:26.125 --> 39:28.452
All right,
I'm gonna get out of here now.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.812
He's okay.
The surgery went well.

39:30.825 --> 39:33.551
Oh, that's terrific.
That is such good news.

39:33.566 --> 39:36.323
He doing really well. They think he'll
be able to go home in a couple days.

39:36.356 --> 39:39.293
Oh, that's so good. Yeah.

39:39.308 --> 39:41.140
So, how's he looking?

39:41.156 --> 39:43.640
Um... he looks good...

39:43.658 --> 39:45.603
big... tall.

39:45.616 --> 39:48.621
That's good. Yeah, he's tall.
He's a big man.

39:48.637 --> 39:50.590
He is a big, tall man.

39:50.968 --> 39:53.090
- Oh, excuse me.
- Can I help you?

39:53.106 --> 39:54.780
Yeah, I'm looking
for Richard Gilmore.

39:54.797 --> 39:56.891
- And you are?
- I'm his son-in-law.

39:56.905 --> 40:00.093
Okay. He's in room b-10.
It's just down the hall.

40:00.107 --> 40:01.803
Take a right at the
nurses' station.

40:01.817 --> 40:03.772
- Is he, uh...
- The surgery went really well.

40:03.785 --> 40:05.423
He's resting comfortably.
He's gonna be fine.

40:05.458 --> 40:07.201
Okay. Good.
All right, so down the hall, right?

40:07.235 --> 40:08.562
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

40:08.726 --> 40:12.092
Okay, so, look, I got a couple of
burgers, assortment of sandwiches.

40:12.105 --> 40:15.032
There's some salads just in case all of
the sudden you want to eat some salad.

40:15.068 --> 40:17.983
All right, couple pieces of pie,
half a dozen chocolate-chip cookies,

40:17.997 --> 40:20.221
and, of course,
there is the fish bag.

40:20.237 --> 40:21.510
You brought a fish bag?

40:21.525 --> 40:23.892
I heard somebody
talking about fish.

40:23.907 --> 40:26.940
There's two fillets, okay,
lobster roll, fish tacos,

40:26.956 --> 40:28.850
two tuna-fish sandwiches,

40:28.868 --> 40:31.602
some fried fish,
and fish sticks.

40:31.618 --> 40:33.500
- Hi. You're here.
- I'm here.

40:33.517 --> 40:34.633
All right, I'm gonna get going.

40:34.667 --> 40:36.571
Yeah, you should.

40:39.298 --> 40:41.523
I'm glad your dad's doing good.

40:45.605 --> 40:48.123
Why didn't you call me?
I didn't think you were coming.

40:48.138 --> 40:49.242
Clearly.

40:49.255 --> 40:51.292
No, he just brought food.
I didn't call him.

40:51.305 --> 40:53.310
I don't want to talk about this --
not now.

40:53.325 --> 40:55.363
Dad. Hey.

40:55.376 --> 40:56.961
Christopher, I'm so
glad you're here.

40:56.976 --> 41:00.283
Of course, of course.
I'm so glad to hear that Richard's okay.

41:00.297 --> 41:01.983
- How you doing, kiddo?
- I'm okay.

41:01.998 --> 41:04.023
I think we're gonna go visit
grandpa again. Do you want to come?

41:04.058 --> 41:05.370
I'm sure he'd be
happy to see you.

41:05.405 --> 41:07.980
- Yeah, that'd be great.
- Okay, come on.

41:15.768 --> 41:17.363
It'll be all right.

41:17.617 --> 41:20.163
Every cloud has
a silver lining.

41:20.385 --> 41:21.842
Thanks, mom.

41:21.895 --> 41:24.580
Well, blood is
thicker than water.
