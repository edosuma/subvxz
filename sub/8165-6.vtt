17:19.081 --> 17:20.081
- Yeah.
- Pretty much.

17:21.083 --> 17:21.915
- But everything in that chapter
was culled

17:22.751 --> 17:24.471
from intellectual property
of Jade Winslow's

17:25.053 --> 17:26.413
that we already own,
so in essence,

17:27.522 --> 17:29.172
in a completely unorthodox

17:30.826 --> 17:31.826
yet totally legal way,

17:31.960 --> 17:33.400
we have successfully
fleeced Achilles

17:34.563 --> 17:35.829
out of $500,000?

17:37.099 --> 17:38.099
- Yep.
- Pretty much.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.460
- Well, not that
I'm giving my blessing,

17:40.936 --> 17:43.136
because this is not how
we do business around here...

17:45.540 --> 17:48.441
But I guess we can chalk it up

17:48.443 --> 17:48.909
to a learning experience

17:49.378 --> 17:51.028
with some enjoyable
fringe benefits.

17:52.681 --> 17:54.031
You dodged a bullet this time.

17:55.384 --> 17:57.234
And, um, you got
a lot of money now.

17:59.087 --> 18:00.220
Spend it wisely.

18:01.356 --> 18:02.923
Both: We will.

18:05.627 --> 18:06.726
- [sighs]

18:06.728 --> 18:07.794

18:16.972 --> 18:18.739
- Uh-huh.

18:20.742 --> 18:22.509
- Hello?
- Hey, Jade.

18:22.511 --> 18:24.177
It's Kelsey and Liza.
- Hi, Jade.

18:25.847 --> 18:27.727
- You know what?
Don't "Hi, Jade" me, all right?

18:27.816 --> 18:30.056
What is this shit on "The Cut"
about you selling my book?

18:30.519 --> 18:32.319
- It's true; You are working
for Achilles now.

18:32.921 --> 18:33.503
- [laughs]
- Wait, are you kidding?

18:34.089 --> 18:35.038
No, I don't want my book
at Achilles, all right?

18:35.991 --> 18:37.431
I refuse to have my book
at Achilles.

18:38.059 --> 18:40.310
- Aren't you forgetting
one tiny little detail?

18:42.564 --> 18:43.564
- What's that?

18:43.698 --> 18:45.065
- Bitch, there is no book!

18:46.435 --> 18:47.534
Bye!

18:50.038 --> 18:52.005
- What?

18:52.007 --> 18:53.007

19:00.081 --> 19:02.001
I knew Hector and Dorff
would love the sculpture.

19:02.117 --> 19:03.797
I told 'em we'd stop by
before the opening.

19:04.820 --> 19:06.860
- I can't wait to see
where they have it on display.

19:07.456 --> 19:08.789
- Yeah. [squeals]

19:13.762 --> 19:14.627
Oh, my God.

19:14.629 --> 19:16.646
Maggie, I am so sorry.
I had no idea.

19:16.647 --> 19:18.664
Oh, my God.

19:20.769 --> 19:21.601
- Hey!

19:21.603 --> 19:23.443
Hello! Hey, look.
It looks amazing, doesn't it?

19:25.040 --> 19:26.040
- So spiritual.

19:26.141 --> 19:27.861
- Spiritual?
You're hanging clothes from it.

19:28.577 --> 19:29.857
- Clothes? No.
This is outerwear.

19:30.779 --> 19:31.859
- Every piece? Work of art.

19:32.447 --> 19:34.487
- Yes, and Maggie's sculpture is
also a work of art.

19:36.084 --> 19:37.084
- Are you saying her art

19:37.752 --> 19:38.234
is more art than our art?

19:38.720 --> 19:40.287
- As long as the check clears,
I'm good.

19:41.857 --> 19:42.857
- Yes? Okay, look.

19:43.558 --> 19:44.558
We want two more. Okay?

19:44.726 --> 19:45.886
- As soon as possible.
- Done.

19:46.728 --> 19:48.128
- But what about
your Hindu goddess?

19:48.563 --> 19:49.603
- I have to say, she looks

19:49.831 --> 19:50.991
pretty damn good in cashmere.
