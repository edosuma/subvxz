WEBVTT

00:04.038 --> 00:04.804
I didn't even think about it.

00:04.805 --> 00:08.808
About death.

00:08.809 --> 00:14.981
But shooting at those things,

00:14.982 --> 00:17.550
anybody in the camera was shot.

00:17.551 --> 00:17.851
Immediately.

00:17.852 --> 00:21.221
By a Russian soldier.

00:21.222 --> 00:23.390
At that time, I didn't
think about that.

00:23.391 --> 00:30.963
But I found that I had
to think about it.

00:30.964 --> 00:32.499
You were alive and holding a

00:32.500 --> 00:34.434
camera at a very important
time in history.

00:34.435 --> 00:37.404
You had to think, I'm doing
something important.

00:37.405 --> 00:40.340
It's very easy to make
pictures, but pictures mean

00:40.341 --> 00:41.408
something, what's in it.

00:41.409 --> 00:45.478
That's a totally
different story.

You know these images.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.529
You grew up with them.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.965
They're burned into your brain.

01:38.966 --> 01:42.869
Their iconic sequences.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.171
Framed and lit and scene through

01:44.172 --> 01:47.840
the lens in ways that
changed filmmaking forever.

01:47.841 --> 01:53.180
All made by the same man.

01:53.181 --> 01:55.415
So, who made these
beautiful things?

01:55.416 --> 01:57.650
Where did he come from?

01:57.651 --> 01:59.552
It didn't begin in Hollywood.

01:59.553 --> 02:07.553
It began here, in the
streets of Budapest.

02:09.597 --> 02:17.597
What about his life, his past,

02:17.938 --> 02:23.276
his upbringing led him again and

02:23.277 --> 02:25.845
again to look through a piece of

02:25.846 --> 02:33.720
glass and make
images like these.

02:33.721 --> 02:36.856
But first, some context.

02:36.857 --> 02:37.457
And schnitzel.

02:37.458 --> 02:45.458
Did I mention schnitzel?

02:51.705 --> 02:53.773
It's beautiful here.

02:53.774 --> 02:57.744
They say that, of course,
that Budapest is beautiful.

02:57.745 --> 03:05.745
But it is, in fact, almost
ludicrously beautiful.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.822
A riot of gorgeous architectural

03:09.823 --> 03:14.461
styles, palaces, grand public
spaces, former mansions of

03:14.462 --> 03:16.296
various princelings, the remains

03:16.297 --> 03:21.534
of a long-gone
empire, still here.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.002
Still here.

03:22.003 --> 03:24.103
If there was such a thing as

03:24.104 --> 03:25.338
building porn, it would be this.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.474
Just looking out the window as

03:27.475 --> 03:30.610
you drive or trolley by,
you think, I want that.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.511
Who lives there?

03:31.512 --> 03:32.979
Who lived there?

03:32.980 --> 03:34.814
What's it like inside?

03:34.815 --> 03:42.815
And where did they go?

03:45.626 --> 03:48.861
From high up Gellard hill, you

03:48.862 --> 03:51.030
get a sense of the
layout of the city.

03:51.031 --> 03:54.267
Divided, split by the Danube

03:54.268 --> 04:01.708
river, Buda on one side,
Pest on the other.

04:01.709 --> 04:03.676
Hungary divided in two.

04:03.677 --> 04:09.148
Literally a
crossroads of worlds.

04:09.149 --> 04:13.185
Which is which?

04:13.186 --> 04:14.020
If you look down,
you're in buda.

04:14.021 --> 04:18.725
If you look up, you're in Pest.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.192
According to the myth I was

04:20.192 --> 04:22.395
brought up, if you are in buda,

04:22.396 --> 04:24.664
you're in Europe and the
other side is Asia.

04:24.665 --> 04:29.969
This is the border of the
Roman empire, originally.

04:29.970 --> 04:30.338
This big river.

04:30.339 --> 04:32.972
Why didn't they cross?

04:32.973 --> 04:35.241
The other side is flat, it's

04:35.242 --> 04:38.244
hard to defend and there were
all these tribes that were

04:38.245 --> 04:40.913
vicious and not as civilized as

04:40.914 --> 04:42.715
the Romans believed they were.

04:42.716 --> 04:48.555
They've all been here, the
settles, the Romans, the

04:48.556 --> 04:50.189
mongols, the ottoman Turks.

04:50.190 --> 04:51.658
All had their way or tried.

04:51.659 --> 04:59.659
All left their Mark to
one extent or another.

05:00.768 --> 05:01.168
♪

05:01.169 --> 05:09.169
Then mid-19th century, the
curious, seemingly improbable

05:09.877 --> 05:10.410
Austro-Hungarian empire.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.744
This is when the city came into

05:11.745 --> 05:16.583
its open, fueled by untold
wealth, accumulated power, and

05:16.584 --> 05:17.684
ambition.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.452
Architecturally,
intellectually, a great city.

05:19.453 --> 05:20.953
One of the world's greatest.

05:20.954 --> 05:25.792
And that was a time
when Budapest was a really

05:25.793 --> 05:27.960
progressive Metropolis.

05:27.961 --> 05:31.464
The first subway in the
continent of Europe was in

05:31.465 --> 05:31.965
Budapest.

05:31.966 --> 05:34.133
Parliament had like a very
sophisticated air-conditioning

05:34.134 --> 05:34.402
system.

05:34.403 --> 05:36.102
So people wanted to come, they

05:36.103 --> 05:38.738
wanted to live here,
wanted to start a career.

05:38.739 --> 05:46.379
Wanted to build places like
this, because it was a good

05:46.380 --> 05:47.380
investment.

05:47.381 --> 05:48.147
The New York cafe is one of

05:48.148 --> 05:49.582
the last remnants of a society

05:49.583 --> 05:51.751
where artists and writers were

05:51.752 --> 05:55.054
valued citizens, regardless
of financial means.

05:55.055 --> 05:59.125
When this cafe was built,

05:59.126 --> 06:01.127
there were more than 500
cafes in this neighborhood.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.662
And this was the biggest and

06:02.663 --> 06:05.131
nicest cafe in the
world at the time.

06:05.132 --> 06:05.965
Never to be closed.

06:05.966 --> 06:08.000
Here, like in most cafes at

06:08.001 --> 06:10.403
that time, a few cents or a few

06:10.404 --> 06:12.138
bucks could buy you space all

06:12.139 --> 06:16.008
day long, sipping your coffee,
thinking great thoughts.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.343
Nobody would hassle you.

06:17.344 --> 06:20.947
It was a petri dish
of creativity.

06:20.948 --> 06:23.182
No hipster neck beard barista

06:23.183 --> 06:25.852
would make you feel bad about
not speaking any dough.

06:25.853 --> 06:28.988
Waiters were speaking
several languages and you read

06:28.989 --> 06:31.257
literature and they invited the

06:31.258 --> 06:32.324
writer, occasionally, if he

06:32.325 --> 06:34.026
didn't have money, because they

06:34.027 --> 06:35.361
appreciated their literature.

06:35.362 --> 06:37.196
Where are we now
compared to there?

06:37.197 --> 06:40.299
Don't try that now, of course.

06:40.300 --> 06:43.636
Today's new-York cafe patrons

06:43.637 --> 06:46.205
spend both their time and money

06:46.206 --> 06:52.211
on things like goose
liver tegrine.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.847
Foie gras is all over Hungary.

06:54.848 --> 06:55.682
And it's good.

06:55.683 --> 06:57.950
Real good.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.719
Peter's going for the soup.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.220
If you looked like a writer,

07:01.221 --> 07:02.555
they would bring you paper and

07:02.556 --> 07:03.790
ink, bring you a dictionary.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.057
Also, most people didn't have

07:05.058 --> 07:07.226
telephones at home and you
could be called here.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.395
Why do I want to
attract writers?

07:09.396 --> 07:15.234
It's like, I need more jazz
musicians on my register.

07:15.235 --> 07:16.202
It was a different time.

07:16.203 --> 07:19.271
It was not simply
about the money.

07:19.272 --> 07:23.910
So it was about identity.

07:23.911 --> 07:24.111
Yeah.

07:24.112 --> 07:28.515
We want to be the place
that attracts the best and the

07:28.516 --> 07:28.782
brightest.

07:28.782 --> 07:29.249
Yeah.

07:29.250 --> 07:30.650
Even if they don't have money.

07:30.651 --> 07:31.151
Yeah.

07:31.152 --> 07:33.185
Those days will never return.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.821
Yeah, those days
will never return.

07:34.822 --> 07:36.188
Lovely, thank you.

07:36.189 --> 07:40.760
For the main courses, Peter
gets the filet of perch.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.762
I'm going for the pork throttle

07:42.763 --> 07:45.532
stew, mostly because I like
the sound of throttle.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.033
That is beautiful.

07:46.034 --> 07:47.834
That makes me very happy.

07:47.835 --> 07:51.270
If I were to ask most
Hungarians, when were the good

07:51.271 --> 07:53.005
old days?

07:53.006 --> 07:55.708
You would have the answer.

07:55.709 --> 08:00.346
Of course, it's not all
foie gras and fine wines.

08:00.347 --> 08:05.785
There are other pleasures,
just as awesome.

08:05.786 --> 08:12.358
Maybe, maybe even more awesome.

08:12.359 --> 08:13.039
Like this.

08:19.132 --> 08:19.432
Plesharda.

08:19.433 --> 08:27.433
A smokey, chilly working class

08:29.209 --> 08:31.611
joint run for the last 25
years and beloved by locals.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.979
A long time coming.

08:32.980 --> 08:37.917
A golden brown pancake
happied with chicken livers,

08:37.918 --> 08:38.585
covered, nay, drowned with a

08:38.586 --> 08:43.655
rich, deeply satisfying
sauce of bone marrow.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.424
I've got to tell
you, this is great.

08:45.425 --> 08:46.659
Some of you have noticed and

08:46.660 --> 08:47.594
complained that I don't really

08:47.595 --> 08:49.528
describe food
anymore, on the show.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.964
This is a deliberate strategy
on my part, actually.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.066
It's really a lot
like writing porn.

08:54.067 --> 08:58.170
After you've used the same
adjectives over and over, look

08:58.171 --> 09:00.973
at it, it's chicken liver, bone

09:00.974 --> 09:02.174
marrow, a delicious pancake.

09:02.175 --> 09:03.475
Is this going to make your life

09:03.476 --> 09:07.513
better at all if I describe
exactly how while smacking my

09:07.514 --> 09:10.182
lips and annoying you?

09:10.183 --> 09:10.350
No.

09:10.350 --> 09:10.651
It's good.

09:10.652 --> 09:18.652
Venison stew, delicious.

09:19.693 --> 09:26.165
And then this.

09:26.166 --> 09:26.366
This.

09:26.367 --> 09:29.669
Good... holy... really?

09:29.670 --> 09:31.503
Good lord!

09:31.504 --> 09:32.639
This I need a photo of.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.373
Put a human hand next to it.

09:34.374 --> 09:35.875
That's just truly terrifying.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.543
Who eats that?

09:37.544 --> 09:40.647
Behold the massiveness, the

09:40.648 --> 09:41.480
surf board-sized fried to order

09:41.481 --> 09:45.718
in a pan to only the highest

09:45.719 --> 09:48.154
standards schnitzel of justice.

09:48.155 --> 09:52.524
Ride that, baby,
all the way home.

09:52.525 --> 09:53.359
Yeah.

09:53.360 --> 09:57.529
Oh, that's good.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.899
Extra pork flavor.

09:59.900 --> 10:04.203
Hints of day-old friar.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.905
I could surf this thing
back to my hotel.

10:05.906 --> 10:06.706
I kid you not.

10:06.707 --> 10:09.308
This is a testament
to a great culture.

10:09.309 --> 10:11.310
Also gout.

10:11.311 --> 10:15.815
But who's counting?

10:15.816 --> 10:18.851
Do I get a T-shirt
if I finish this?

10:18.852 --> 10:22.790
Or my picture on the wall?

called to serve a higher

10:38.872 --> 10:39.272
purpose.

10:39.273 --> 10:42.775
Put here on earth to do
god's mysterious will.

10:42.776 --> 10:45.111
Daniel Matta is here for this.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.747
To spread the gospel of meat.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.750
Hungarian meat-related wisdom in

10:50.751 --> 10:54.954
all its delicious,
delicious variety.

10:54.955 --> 10:58.357
Like St. Francis of Assisi, he

10:58.358 --> 11:00.526
wanders the earth,
doing good works.

11:00.527 --> 11:04.964
In this case, highlighting the
ancient arts of butchery,

11:04.965 --> 11:08.968
sausage making, and the
preparation of many of the

11:08.969 --> 11:10.236
Lord's creatures.

11:10.237 --> 11:18.237
As he, himself, would no doubt
like to see them prepared.

11:22.249 --> 11:25.284
What have you heard
about Budapest butchers?

11:25.285 --> 11:27.754
Not much.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.655
We have about seven
butchers in Budapest.

11:29.656 --> 11:30.990
Seven?

11:30.991 --> 11:34.894
You can find us on a small
dorn with roasted meats.

11:34.895 --> 11:35.828
It's very.

11:35.829 --> 11:37.396
In five minutes, you can find

11:37.397 --> 11:39.565
a butcher where you
can eat something.

11:39.566 --> 11:47.173
And on this particular
corner, one of Daniel's

11:47.174 --> 11:47.440
favorites.

11:47.441 --> 11:48.808
So, you are not a butcher.

11:48.809 --> 11:51.077
You're not... no, no.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.945
What is your... what do you the?

11:52.946 --> 11:54.113
I am an economist.

11:54.114 --> 11:58.150
I understand it, you go from

11:58.151 --> 11:59.351
butcher shop from butcher
shop, investigating butchers.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.186
Why do you do that?

12:00.187 --> 12:07.126
Because I like it.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.261
And I thought, I'm
not alone with this.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.497
So we should make a fan club.

12:11.498 --> 12:13.632
And it started to
rise on Facebook.

12:13.633 --> 12:17.603
Nearly 10,000 likes.

12:17.604 --> 12:19.872
It's so unusual that
there are so many.

12:19.873 --> 12:23.342
Because in France, Germany,
in the states, the old school

12:23.343 --> 12:26.445
butchers who know how to do
all of these things, they're

12:26.446 --> 12:26.780
disappearing.

12:26.781 --> 12:28.214
Their kids aren't doing it.

12:28.215 --> 12:32.819
It's not so easy to be
a butcher now in Hungary.

12:32.820 --> 12:39.225
But with this catering function
doing prepared foods.

12:39.226 --> 12:41.660
They try to save themselves.

12:41.661 --> 12:43.830
Yes, there are many boutique

12:43.831 --> 12:46.899
cuts of meat available, as one
would expect from a master

12:46.900 --> 12:47.234
butcher.

12:47.235 --> 12:48.000
But then there's this.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.836
A field of dreams.

12:49.837 --> 12:51.637
A landscape of braised and fried

12:51.638 --> 12:54.540
and cured delights that seem,

12:54.541 --> 12:56.675
under glass, to go on forever.

12:56.676 --> 12:59.846
A good Hungarian butcher shop,
they should be able to cut

12:59.847 --> 13:01.513
meat, cure meat, make sausage,

13:01.514 --> 13:02.982
and cook preparations as well.

13:02.983 --> 13:03.582
Yeah.

13:03.583 --> 13:04.416
Look at that.

13:04.417 --> 13:05.251
There he goes.

13:05.252 --> 13:06.819
So beautiful.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.321
There's no comparison
with a supermark.

13:09.322 --> 13:12.691
Plus, you can ask him,
what's good today.

13:12.692 --> 13:15.127
Today... oh, look,
what great timing.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.563
They're making one
of my favorites.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.498
Blood sausage.

13:19.499 --> 13:22.734
You have to say in
English, because I can't.

13:22.735 --> 13:23.702
Paprika.

13:23.703 --> 13:25.504
Paprika.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.706
Oregano.

13:27.707 --> 13:28.207
Thyme.

13:32.880 --> 13:33.412
Marjoram.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.113
All spice.

13:34.114 --> 13:35.447
Here comes the rice.

13:35.448 --> 13:36.715
Here comes the blood.

13:36.716 --> 13:37.884
Here comes the blood.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.853
Beautiful, so good.

13:40.854 --> 13:41.188
Salt.

13:41.189 --> 13:42.121
And the sugar.

13:42.122 --> 13:42.955
I don't understand why.

13:42.956 --> 13:46.458
It makes flavors pop.

13:46.459 --> 13:46.726
Beautiful.

13:46.727 --> 13:51.964
Seasoned and right
into the tube.

13:51.965 --> 13:58.971
Stand by for big jokes.

13:58.972 --> 13:59.638
All right.

13:59.639 --> 14:01.073
So what do we have here?

14:01.074 --> 14:02.474
Oh, that looks good.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.775
Some nice pickles.

14:03.776 --> 14:04.911
Braced red cabbage.

14:04.912 --> 14:11.783
Over there, from the mighty
shanks of some mythical

14:11.784 --> 14:13.319
creature, perhaps, slow braced

14:13.320 --> 14:16.155
until the meat is
falling off the bone.

14:16.156 --> 14:19.425
And let there be blood,
delicious, delicious blood, in

14:19.426 --> 14:23.662
tube form, served, still
steaming, nay, heaving,

14:23.663 --> 14:25.297
engorged, as you will, with

14:25.298 --> 14:26.832
goodness, to squirt across your

14:26.833 --> 14:29.601
plate as you press against it
with the side of your fork.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.602
So delicious.

14:30.603 --> 14:32.304
So how often do you do?

14:32.305 --> 14:33.940
Two or three times a week.

14:33.941 --> 14:40.512
What distinguishes a good
butcher from an okay butcher?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.681
They're doing
good business here.

14:42.682 --> 14:45.351
That is true.

14:45.352 --> 14:46.185
Yeah?

14:46.186 --> 14:48.520
I can't tell you which
is my favorite butcher.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.689
All of them are different.

14:50.690 --> 14:51.124
Right.

14:51.125 --> 14:53.459
Do you ever just going
out for like a salad?

14:53.460 --> 14:54.026
No.

14:54.027 --> 14:54.911
I kid, I kid.

15:07.374 --> 15:10.176
There is another long
tradition of artistry here in

15:10.177 --> 15:10.443
Budapest.

15:10.444 --> 15:13.212
We grew up with their works.

15:13.213 --> 15:18.584
Visual artists,
photographers, filmmakers.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.620
Where did they all go?

15:21.621 --> 15:27.459
Well, world war I happened
and with it, the end of the

15:27.460 --> 15:28.327
Austro-Hungarian empire.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.895
Budapest and all Europe
changed forever.

15:29.896 --> 15:32.999
A decades-long wave
of emigration began.

15:33.000 --> 15:35.167
A stunning number of the world's

15:35.168 --> 15:36.735
great photographers fled their

15:36.736 --> 15:40.572
native Hungary and
took up new lives.

15:40.573 --> 15:46.045
Eventually, this
man joined them.

15:46.046 --> 15:49.415
I've been shooting photos since
I remember I was living.

15:49.416 --> 15:53.885
I was 5 or 6 years old when I
was taking pictures with my

15:53.886 --> 15:54.987
father's Kodak camera.

15:54.988 --> 15:56.755
The right moment, you
have to capture.

15:56.756 --> 16:04.756
And that's the difficult
part the exact moment.

16:06.733 --> 16:11.903
Hungarians, there is
this need to excel.

16:11.904 --> 16:15.441
My father was not
really an artist.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.542
He was a soccer player.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.944
A very good one.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.847
He said, son, whatever you do,

16:21.848 --> 16:25.851
you have to be the best at it.

16:25.852 --> 16:29.688
First, not second, you
have to be first.

16:29.689 --> 16:37.689
Otherwise it's not worth it.

16:42.369 --> 16:48.307
Vilomo Zigma.

16:48.308 --> 16:50.042
Legendary cinematographer.

16:50.043 --> 16:52.978
If you don't know his
name, you know his work.

16:52.979 --> 16:55.781
The Oscar-winning
"close encounters."

16:55.782 --> 16:56.882
"The deer hunter."

16:56.883 --> 17:01.487
His evolutionary work on
"McCabe and Mrs. Miller."

17:01.488 --> 17:04.256
"The long good-bye."

17:04.257 --> 17:04.590
"Deliverance."

17:04.592 --> 17:06.657
He created a whole new palette,

17:06.659 --> 17:08.760
took crazy risks, changed film

17:08.761 --> 17:13.299
language in ways people
still try to imitate.

17:13.300 --> 17:15.634
And he's making our camera crew

17:15.635 --> 17:19.938
very nervous, I can tell you.

17:19.939 --> 17:23.142
You taught yourself to shoot.

17:23.143 --> 17:26.444
Basically, I always tried to

17:26.445 --> 17:32.184
use my father's Kodak camera.

17:32.185 --> 17:34.286
It's a kidney disease.

17:34.287 --> 17:37.923
I was in bed for a month and an

17:37.924 --> 17:45.131
uncle of mine gave me a book
about a great photographer.

17:45.132 --> 17:49.535
And I started to take
just amateur pictures.

17:49.536 --> 17:53.672
One thing that hasn't changed
through the years is the

17:53.673 --> 17:56.375
Hungarian affection for taking
the waters, marinading in

17:56.376 --> 17:57.543
thermal baths, a tradition going

17:57.544 --> 17:59.211
back to the Romans, continued by

17:59.212 --> 18:01.046
the ottomans, and something that

18:01.047 --> 18:03.315
survived right through
two wars and communism.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.684
And they do it in style.

18:05.685 --> 18:09.221
Who came here?

18:09.222 --> 18:10.156
Back in those days?

18:10.157 --> 18:12.124
Was this reserved for anyone who

18:12.125 --> 18:14.626
wanted to could come here?

18:14.627 --> 18:20.732
Well, you know, money wise,

18:20.733 --> 18:23.969
everyone before did
basically what was cheap.

18:23.970 --> 18:24.736
Right.

18:24.737 --> 18:27.339
In hungry, we have so many spas.

18:27.340 --> 18:32.077
There are many bathhouse spas.

18:32.078 --> 18:33.512
Baroque, elaborately wedding

18:33.513 --> 18:36.815
cakes, built atop mineral rich

18:36.816 --> 18:42.521
hot Springs gurgling
from the earth.

18:42.522 --> 18:44.623
None more storied
than the Geller.

18:44.624 --> 18:47.092
You arrived in
Budapest around age 21.

18:47.093 --> 18:49.561
What was the city like then?

18:49.562 --> 18:55.601
It was always beautiful.

18:55.602 --> 19:00.706
There were ruins after the war.

19:00.707 --> 19:05.010
Half of the city was
still in ruins.

19:05.011 --> 19:06.445
When you first moved here,

19:06.446 --> 19:10.249
you go to film school, what was

19:10.250 --> 19:12.184
your average day like
other than your studies?

19:12.185 --> 19:14.853
What did you do for
fun back then?

19:14.854 --> 19:15.387
What were your options?

19:15.388 --> 19:22.694
Our options were zero.

19:22.695 --> 19:26.097
Imagine from little help
from the government.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.065
Very little money.

19:27.066 --> 19:29.568
Enough to have breakfast and

19:29.569 --> 19:33.972
lunch or breakfast and dinner.

19:33.973 --> 19:36.742
You had to skip lunch
for a pair of socks.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.611
So we were very, very poor.

19:39.612 --> 19:47.612
But I must say that under this

19:47.754 --> 19:52.924
whole thing, the happiest part

19:52.925 --> 20:00.299
of my life was when I fell
in love, immediately.

20:00.300 --> 20:02.501
In fact, some of Vilmos' most

20:02.502 --> 20:04.970
powerful and world-changing
footage occurred around this

20:04.971 --> 20:06.838
time, before leaving Hungary, as

20:06.839 --> 20:10.609
a film student during the
outbreak of revolution.

20:10.610 --> 20:12.979
But we'll get to that later.

20:32.799 --> 20:40.799
In many ways, Viloms Zigma's
career as one of the great

20:41.474 --> 20:43.809
photographers in
cinematography begins here.

20:43.810 --> 20:50.316
Here he was raised by his
father, who worked many jobs to

20:50.317 --> 20:53.051
make ends meet.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.620
Weekends in warmer months all

20:54.621 --> 20:56.655
over Hungary, wherever there's a

20:56.656 --> 21:00.025
river and fish, places like this

21:00.026 --> 21:01.460
are thronging with families.

21:01.461 --> 21:07.399
And here along the Tisa
river is no exception.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.801
Here Vilmos and his dad would

21:09.802 --> 21:12.304
come and eat the local
specialty of soup.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.573
How old were you when you
first came to this place?

21:14.574 --> 21:20.679
I must have been
about 7 years old.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.181
You know, my father
was really great.

21:23.182 --> 21:25.651
Those days, years, actually, he

21:25.652 --> 21:31.357
didn't have much time, but
occasionally, he wants to take

21:31.358 --> 21:32.558
me away, away from work.

21:32.559 --> 21:34.360
He loved this place, actually.

21:34.361 --> 21:39.197
He loved this,
especially this fish.

21:39.198 --> 21:42.534
That's murky and good-looking

21:42.535 --> 21:47.839
and need some bread
for this, for sure.

21:47.840 --> 21:48.874
Pike from the river simmered

21:48.875 --> 21:52.411
low and slow in a rich fish
stock with healthy amount of

21:52.412 --> 22:00.412
onions and the near you pick we

22:03.923 --> 22:07.058
to us but always good paprika.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.059
That's good.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.461
On the summer, in the side.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.196
Then go swimming in the river.

22:11.197 --> 22:12.230
It was a great place.

22:12.231 --> 22:20.038
Used to be a great
place for fun.

22:20.039 --> 22:20.972
And you know at night, we

22:20.973 --> 22:24.410
used to come here at night, when

22:24.411 --> 22:25.944
the gypsies were playing music.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.146
And I loved that, actually.

22:28.147 --> 22:36.147
I always loved gypsy music.

22:36.155 --> 22:40.759
They had a very happy childhood.

22:40.760 --> 22:44.796
Good times until, until the war

22:44.797 --> 22:50.669
got in and then stopped all
that happiness, you know?

22:50.670 --> 22:54.406
There was just hard times.

22:54.407 --> 22:58.610
Were you fully aware of how
bad, how grave things were?

22:58.611 --> 23:00.946
Near the end of the war, the

23:00.947 --> 23:04.115
Germans came in and then
started to bomb us.

23:04.116 --> 23:10.489
And they started to take Jews,

23:10.490 --> 23:13.425
actually, to work in camps.

23:13.426 --> 23:17.596
That started to be
very, very ugly.

23:17.597 --> 23:20.799
For people of your
generation, who grew up, these

23:20.800 --> 23:23.435
were incredibly insecure times.

23:23.436 --> 23:24.035
Psychologically, what do you

23:24.036 --> 23:27.105
think that teaches you
as far as a world view?

23:27.106 --> 23:28.674
Do you become more adaptable?

23:28.675 --> 23:30.609
Do you become more suspicious?

23:30.610 --> 23:32.844
Do you become more cynical?

23:32.845 --> 23:36.081
It's about survival, actually.

23:36.082 --> 23:42.988
We want to survive as Siberians,
to preserve identity as

23:42.989 --> 23:43.855
hung Hungarians.

23:43.856 --> 23:45.724
So that's what we did.

23:45.725 --> 23:46.058
And survived.

23:46.059 --> 23:47.659
We saw a lot as a young boy,

23:47.660 --> 23:49.461
as he would later, as an adult.

23:49.462 --> 23:53.499
In 1944, German tanks
rolled into Hungary.

23:53.500 --> 23:58.904
His country was now in the
hands of a foreign power.

23:58.905 --> 24:04.510
It made me thinking
back to my school years.

24:04.511 --> 24:08.046
I almost said those were the
happiest years of my life.

24:08.047 --> 24:16.047
Being under a regime,
terrible things happened.

24:17.657 --> 24:18.690
We were stuck.

24:18.691 --> 24:22.427
Being in the film school was

24:22.428 --> 24:23.862
like an island of the craziness.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.664
I grew up in New Jersey.

24:25.665 --> 24:27.198
My family was sentimental about

24:27.199 --> 24:29.668
beautiful pictures,
a beautiful script.

24:29.669 --> 24:33.204
We saw every film you ever shot

24:33.205 --> 24:36.708
and talked about them
at the dinner table.

24:36.709 --> 24:37.576
These were important.

24:37.577 --> 24:38.710
This has got to look pretty

24:38.711 --> 24:41.847
close to the way it did
in the old day, right?

24:41.848 --> 24:42.881
Oh, yeah.

24:42.882 --> 24:44.015
Doesn't change much.

24:44.016 --> 24:48.353
Through it all for Vilmos
was this place, however.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.956
A very special place for a boy
growing up during wartime.

24:50.957 --> 24:54.059
The moviehouse where he
saw his first films.

24:54.060 --> 25:02.060
What memorable films did
you see in this theater?

25:04.637 --> 25:09.407
My probably best experience
in my life, I was in Hungary,

25:09.408 --> 25:13.211
see chaplain's "the dictator."

25:13.212 --> 25:15.914
Democracy is fragrant.

25:15.915 --> 25:16.615
Liberty stunk.

25:16.616 --> 25:22.654
Liberty is odious.

25:22.655 --> 25:26.524
Freedom of speech is objectable.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.427
Chaplain did such a
great job, you know.

25:29.428 --> 25:33.965
Some films, of course,
resonated more than others.

25:33.966 --> 25:40.739
The power of the visual image

25:40.740 --> 25:43.408
intensified by what was going
on outside that dark room.

25:43.409 --> 25:46.978
Fills could be inspiring, but
they could be dangerous.

25:46.979 --> 25:49.114
It was so magical, to go to a

25:49.115 --> 25:51.416
film, especially a dangerous
one, one that was just the

25:51.417 --> 25:54.485
subject matter and the content

25:54.486 --> 25:57.255
was different and to see that

25:57.256 --> 25:59.157
just, oh, my god, what do I do

25:59.158 --> 26:01.159
with my life now
after seeing this?

26:01.160 --> 26:07.399
This theater, by the way,
is now named in his honor.

26:23.282 --> 26:25.383
When you look at footage you

26:25.384 --> 26:28.119
took during the revolution,
you're not in those pictures,

26:28.120 --> 26:29.821
but do you see yourself?

26:29.822 --> 26:33.224
Do you remember
what it felt like?

26:33.225 --> 26:37.328
I remember that I was
actually scared to death.

26:37.329 --> 26:40.165
Shooting those, going
through there, should be.

26:40.166 --> 26:43.669
I found I had to photograph it.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.871
Things were going from one side

26:45.872 --> 26:47.806
to the other side of the Danube.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.207
There were tanks
coming across this?

26:49.208 --> 26:53.211
Well, yes, actually.

26:53.212 --> 26:59.417
It was a pretty cool,
cold day, too.

26:59.418 --> 27:00.185
Yeah.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.853
It was bad weather.

27:01.854 --> 27:05.523
It was pretty much, you know,

27:05.524 --> 27:09.094
you could see what was
happening in Budapest.

27:09.095 --> 27:11.930
After the war, a cold war.

27:11.931 --> 27:14.332
Hungary now found itself firmly

27:14.333 --> 27:15.934
in the grip of the Soviet union.

27:15.935 --> 27:23.935
Germans had been replaced
by Russian comisars.

27:29.581 --> 27:34.552
Vilmos was now at film school
along with his best friend,

27:34.553 --> 27:34.787
Laszlo.

27:34.788 --> 27:37.823
Then in 1956, something
amazing happened.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.525
Hated emblems of red tyranny

27:40.526 --> 27:42.560
went down as hub guerin patriots

27:42.561 --> 27:50.561
for ten glorious days sent
armored Russians which pitted

27:52.604 --> 27:54.205
rifles against tanks.

27:54.206 --> 27:58.076
The statue of Stalin used
to be under the first night,

27:58.077 --> 28:00.411
actually, when the revolution

28:00.412 --> 28:02.613
started, the people wanted
to take the statue down.

28:02.614 --> 28:05.583
It took about a couple of hours,

28:05.584 --> 28:09.921
actually, to get Mr.
Stalin's legs off.

28:09.922 --> 28:17.462
And naturally, the next day,
people took pieces home as a

28:17.463 --> 28:17.764
souvenir.

28:17.765 --> 28:21.332
To date, this was something
that had never been done.

28:21.333 --> 28:26.404
The Hungarians took
to the streets.

28:26.405 --> 28:28.774
A revolution.

28:28.775 --> 28:32.978
That's when Vilmos and Laszlo
and some pals snuck 35

28:32.979 --> 28:34.179
millimeter cameras and film out

28:34.180 --> 28:37.015
of their school's equipment
room, and at great risk to

28:37.016 --> 28:39.184
themselves, joined their
countrymen in the streets,

28:39.185 --> 28:42.253
documenting the revolt
and the aftermath.

28:42.254 --> 28:46.624
These images are from some
of that historic footage.

28:46.625 --> 28:49.627
It seemed for ten glorious days,

28:49.628 --> 28:51.362
that freedom had finally come.

28:51.363 --> 28:56.101
Encouraged by the west and
by CIA radio broadcasts in

28:56.102 --> 28:58.804
particular, the Hungarians
believed that help was on its

28:58.805 --> 28:59.005
way.

28:59.006 --> 29:01.139
That this was it.

29:01.140 --> 29:03.374
They dug in and fought.

29:03.375 --> 29:10.548
Hoping to hold out
until help arrived.

29:10.549 --> 29:17.555
On November 4th, a desperate
plea went out over the air

29:17.556 --> 29:17.790
waves.

29:17.791 --> 29:21.860
This is Hungary calling.

29:21.861 --> 29:26.464
This is Hungary calling.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.233
For the sake of
god, help Hungary.

29:28.234 --> 29:29.367
The Russians had been beaten

29:29.368 --> 29:31.136
back for a time, but now they

29:31.137 --> 29:32.838
doubled down with a vengeance,

29:32.839 --> 29:34.639
pouring tanks and troops and

29:34.640 --> 29:39.144
heavy armor back into Budapest
and brutally and all too

29:39.145 --> 29:42.080
effectively put down
the resistance.

29:42.081 --> 29:43.014
Help never came.

29:43.015 --> 29:46.918
This is a place where a
lot of things happened.

29:46.919 --> 29:48.153
Used to be the headquarters.

29:48.154 --> 29:50.889
I never shot this before, so

29:50.890 --> 29:53.658
this is about the first time I'm

29:53.659 --> 29:56.061
going to get this building shot.

29:56.062 --> 29:59.097
So this was the internal
secret police, so if someone

29:59.098 --> 30:01.332
came at night with a Van and he

30:01.333 --> 30:04.903
were taken away, you ended
up being interrogated here?

30:04.904 --> 30:06.104
Yes.

30:06.105 --> 30:07.772
Secret police
headquarters in 1956.

30:07.773 --> 30:10.008
The site of a firefight between

30:10.009 --> 30:13.945
snipers on the roof, and
their fellow citizens below.

30:13.946 --> 30:18.884
Then the people got into the

30:18.885 --> 30:21.352
building, went up there, hunted

30:21.353 --> 30:25.857
them down and killed them,
actually, basically.

30:25.858 --> 30:27.458
And hanged them ton the streets.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.727
Hung them here.

30:29.728 --> 30:31.296
Hung them on the street.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.630
It's hard to find a tree which

30:32.631 --> 30:39.537
they hung those people up there.

30:39.538 --> 30:45.310
Had you see people killed
before the revolution?

30:45.311 --> 30:46.544
Though.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.379
Very tragic moment.

30:48.380 --> 30:50.481
The building is abandoned.

30:50.482 --> 30:55.420
The door, as it turns
out, wide open.

30:55.421 --> 30:56.454
Oh, wow.

30:56.455 --> 31:04.455
Oh, look at that.

31:06.065 --> 31:12.337
It still feels sad.

31:12.338 --> 31:17.675
A little haunted, yeah?

31:17.676 --> 31:21.279
Those were vicious
times, you know.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.748
People's life was not really

31:23.749 --> 31:30.255
important to these
people, they were cruel.

31:30.256 --> 31:33.291
And you have people, some of
them have been to Siberia.

31:33.292 --> 31:36.027
They killed so many people after

31:36.028 --> 31:40.331
that time, unfortunately.

31:40.332 --> 31:46.004
And they went through the film.

31:46.005 --> 31:53.544
People were in trouble,
many were killed.
