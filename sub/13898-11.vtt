Des.

00:08.960 --> 00:10.090
Hey Jake. Man.
What are you doing here?

00:10.130 --> 00:11.590
I'm taking Leslie
for breakfast.

00:11.630 --> 00:13.430
More importantly, what the hell
are you doing here?

00:13.470 --> 00:14.640
Official
Doyle business.

00:15.220 --> 00:15.720
You're lying.

00:16.220 --> 00:17.430
Okay. Okay.

00:17.470 --> 00:18.890
See, you can read me better
than anyone else.

00:18.930 --> 00:19.930
That's our special bond.

00:19.970 --> 00:20.600
I'm taking Tinny for breakfast.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.060
You were better off
lying to me.

00:28.020 --> 00:28.900
Leslie.

00:30.150 --> 00:30.940
Hello?

00:31.820 --> 00:32.110
Where the hell is everybody?

00:33.450 --> 00:35.490
Jake, what are you doing here?
You need to go.

00:35.530 --> 00:37.030
Okay?
It's a really bad time.

00:37.070 --> 00:39.080
It's probably just
the hunger talking.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.410
All those late shifts.

00:40.450 --> 00:42.370
They make the
blood sugar just drop.

00:43.410 --> 00:45.500
Just don't come over here.
Okay?

00:45.540 --> 00:47.880
We're busy.
You should leave.

00:49.090 --> 00:49.750
Why are you acting so weird?

00:50.880 --> 00:53.720
Jake. Just go. Now.
We're training.

00:56.510 --> 00:57.800
Leslie.
Where's your gun?

00:57.850 --> 01:00.560
Please. Just go.
Now. Des.

01:00.600 --> 01:01.930
[gun shot]

01:03.310 --> 01:04.850
You shoulda really
listened to her.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.020
This is a police station.
Alright?

01:08.730 --> 01:09.770
Even with that gun,

01:09.820 --> 01:11.150
you think you're
gonna walk outta here

01:11.190 --> 01:12.570
without me trying to stop you?

01:13.320 --> 01:14.860
Pretty dangerous plan.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.950
Especially
when you factor this in.

01:20.490 --> 01:22.750
Nobody's going anywhere.

You have not thought
this thing through.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.740
Okay Mister
I Wanna Be a Hero Today.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.080
Get back with the rest of them.

02:05.120 --> 02:06.000
Do it.

02:07.290 --> 02:08.210
Just do what he says.

Please.

02:11.920 --> 02:12.750
[gunman]
Okay people.

02:13.710 --> 02:15.170
I'm gonna lay this out for you.

02:15.210 --> 02:16.380
You see these wires?

02:17.470 --> 02:19.050
They monitor
my heart rate.

02:19.090 --> 02:20.930
You hear those beeps?
You hear that?

02:22.010 --> 02:24.560
Piss me off.
Or try jumping on me.

02:24.600 --> 02:26.600
My heart rate goes up?
We got a problem.

02:26.640 --> 02:30.150
My heart rate drops?
You try to shoot me?

02:30.190 --> 02:33.440
Knock me out?
Now we got another problem.

02:34.150 --> 02:35.070
Boom!

02:36.400 --> 02:39.070
We don't want no boom.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.700
So, if any of you
have any bright ideas,

02:43.950 --> 02:47.580
I suggest you forget
about them really quick.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.120
Got me?

02:49.170 --> 02:50.080
Listen, buddy.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.750
I'm just saying,
alright.

02:51.790 --> 02:52.960
Why don't we shut
that thing down.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
And then we can all,
go have a pint,

02:55.050 --> 02:57.050
or some eggs.
Okay? On Des.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.430
Sir.
Let's just calm down.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.970
I am calm!

03:01.010 --> 03:02.640
You calm down,
Miss Blondie.

03:03.850 --> 03:07.230
It's not too late
to end this peacefully.

03:08.140 --> 03:09.060
Tell me why you're doing this.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.230
What do you want?

03:11.270 --> 03:13.110
This is so the opposite of how I
thought this morning should go.

03:13.150 --> 03:13.810
Shut up.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.320
Although appropriate,

03:15.360 --> 03:17.190
I'd really love it if those were
not your last words to me.

03:17.230 --> 03:18.190
[woman]
Guys.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.610
Seriously.
The bomb. The beeping.

03:20.490 --> 03:22.740
I want all the cops out now.

03:23.490 --> 03:24.870
It's not gonna happen.

03:24.910 --> 03:25.830
All the cops out.

03:25.870 --> 03:27.240
I just want civilians in here.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.000
Or I'm gonna
blow this place up.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.160
OK, I think he means it.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.460
Officer.
You should do what he says.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.300
Okay.
We'll go.

03:37.630 --> 03:38.460
But as a gesture of good faith,

03:39.670 --> 03:41.260
I'm asking that you
send out a civilian

03:41.300 --> 03:42.380
with every cop.

03:42.430 --> 03:43.720
[Jake]
Yeah, that's a good idea, man.

03:43.760 --> 03:44.720
Think about it.

03:44.760 --> 03:45.850
It'll prove to them all

03:45.890 --> 03:47.100
that you're not
some kind of psycho.

03:52.270 --> 03:53.270
Five cops.

03:54.650 --> 03:55.690
Five civilians.

03:56.190 --> 03:57.730
Do it now.

03:59.320 --> 04:03.070
You. You. You. You. You.

04:05.570 --> 04:06.530
Be careful.

04:10.910 --> 04:12.370
You. Go on. Go, go!

04:12.410 --> 04:13.330
[gunman]
No, no, no, no.

04:13.370 --> 04:14.290
I don't remember

04:14.330 --> 04:15.500
saying you could go.

04:15.540 --> 04:17.380
Listen.
She is a cop.

04:17.420 --> 04:19.800
I'm his niece. He's just
saying that to get me out.

04:19.840 --> 04:22.720
Shut up.
And get back there.

04:22.760 --> 04:23.510
Get back there
with the rest of them. Do it.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.890
You're the fella who wants
all the cops out of here.

04:26.930 --> 04:28.720
Okay, I'm telling you.
She's a cop.

04:28.760 --> 04:29.680
She should go.

04:29.720 --> 04:31.230
You think I'm stupid?

04:35.270 --> 04:38.400
Fine.
Do it your way.

04:43.950 --> 04:44.910
Cell phones.

04:45.910 --> 04:46.870
I know you all got cell phones.

04:47.580 --> 04:48.740
Get the garbage can.

04:48.780 --> 04:49.040
Get the garbage can.

04:49.990 --> 04:51.330
Put them in the can.
Let's go.

04:51.370 --> 04:52.580
Now.

04:52.620 --> 04:53.710
Do it!

05:02.300 --> 05:03.420
Listen carefully everyone.

05:03.470 --> 05:04.670
We got a subject inside

05:04.720 --> 05:06.640
with a bomb connected
to a heart monitor.

05:06.680 --> 05:08.260
So if he even gets
too stressed out,

05:08.300 --> 05:09.680
we got a serious problem
in that building.

05:10.810 --> 05:12.770
All standard protocols
are suspended.

05:12.810 --> 05:15.310
And no one does anything without
it coming from me first.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.440
We need snipers to the west,
north and south.

05:19.480 --> 05:22.230
- I need eyes inside now.
- Got 'em.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.570
Via the security cameras.

05:24.780 --> 05:26.030
Leslie.
What's the situation?

05:26.070 --> 05:27.160
We heard about
it on the news.

05:27.200 --> 05:27.990
Are Jake and Des
in there?

05:28.030 --> 05:29.200
And Tinny.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.740
But you guys know
I can't allow you in here.

05:30.780 --> 05:31.740
Leslie,
I can help.

05:31.790 --> 05:33.700
Mal. You need to
let us do our job.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.290
I'm sorry,
but you have to leave.

05:36.420 --> 05:37.870
I got an ID on the subject.

05:37.920 --> 05:40.340
Charles Alomar.
No record. No priors.

05:40.380 --> 05:41.590
We're looking
into his background.

05:41.630 --> 05:44.840
Excellent. Malachy.
Rose. Please.

05:44.880 --> 05:45.800
Understood.

05:47.300 --> 05:49.430
Tinny's in there?
We gotta look into this guy.

05:49.470 --> 05:50.510
Charles?

05:50.550 --> 05:51.760
Alomar.
Let's see what we can find.

05:52.600 --> 05:54.060
Now.

05:54.100 --> 05:57.020
It's about time we find out what
Mr. Alomar's demands are.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.480
[ring]

06:03.230 --> 06:03.780
That's them.

06:04.860 --> 06:06.150
They'll want to know
your demands.

06:07.820 --> 06:08.360
[ring]

06:08.990 --> 06:10.240
[Des]
Oh. Oh!

06:10.280 --> 06:11.990
You should start with the less
crazy ones first.

06:12.030 --> 06:13.910
You know,
build up a solid rapport.

06:19.370 --> 06:21.170
Hello.
This is Sergeant Bennett.

06:21.210 --> 06:22.670
Is everyone still okay in there?

06:22.710 --> 06:23.880
[Charles]
Hey Miss Blondie.

06:23.920 --> 06:25.130
I remember you.

06:25.170 --> 06:26.340
Yeah.
We're all good.

06:27.340 --> 06:28.760
We're all good,
right people?

06:28.800 --> 06:30.470
We're good.

06:30.510 --> 06:31.680
We're good. Yeah.

06:31.720 --> 06:33.970
For now. Got it?

06:34.010 --> 06:34.350
[Leslie]
Mr. Alomar,

06:35.430 --> 06:37.140
I think we all
want the same thing.

06:37.180 --> 06:39.060
[monitor starts to beep faster]

06:39.100 --> 06:40.940
Hey. Hey.
You gotta breathe.

06:41.360 --> 06:42.310
Whoo.

06:42.360 --> 06:42.610
Not you Des.

06:43.860 --> 06:44.820
Okay. Now that
you've figured out my name.

06:46.150 --> 06:48.070
You probably know all about
me and my brother.

06:48.110 --> 06:49.650
Mr. Alomar.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.200
Let's just talk about getting
everyone out of there safely,

06:52.240 --> 06:53.410
including you.

06:53.450 --> 06:54.540
I got one demand.

06:55.410 --> 06:56.950
You clear my brother's name.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.170
He's innocent.
And you know it!

07:00.710 --> 07:02.250
What are you looking at?

07:02.290 --> 07:03.750
Huh, Mister Hero Man?

07:03.790 --> 07:07.380
Do yourself a favor.
Mind your business.

07:07.420 --> 07:08.880
I apologize.

07:08.920 --> 07:10.970
It's just that fellas with
dynamite attached to their chest

07:12.010 --> 07:13.890
just kinda grabs
my full attention.

07:15.310 --> 07:19.770
I don't like you very much.
You keep this up, and

07:19.810 --> 07:21.190
- BOOM!
- Oh God.

07:21.230 --> 07:22.100
You got me?

07:32.990 --> 07:34.330
Mal.
Tinny's in there with Jake.

07:34.370 --> 07:35.530
If I know him,

07:35.580 --> 07:36.950
he's doing whatever he can
to keep her safe.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.790
I know. She'll get through this.
We all will.

07:38.830 --> 07:40.080
Charles Alomar is mentioned

07:40.120 --> 07:42.210
in each of these news articles
from last week.

07:42.250 --> 07:43.210
His brother was arrested for
selling drugs

07:43.250 --> 07:44.460
to an undercover cop.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.210
But what does that have
to do with Charles?

07:46.250 --> 07:48.300
Charles has been telling every
reporter in town

07:48.340 --> 07:49.210
that his brother was set up.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.510
That he's innocent.

07:50.550 --> 07:51.840
Well, if the brother's anything
like Charles.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.390
He might be right.
Look at this.

07:53.430 --> 07:54.930
Community leader.
Children's advocate.

07:54.970 --> 07:56.260
He sounds like a saint.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.720
If he's looking for a way
to get his voice heard,

07:57.760 --> 07:58.890
I think he's found it.

07:58.930 --> 08:00.810
We need to check out
this brother of his.

08:00.850 --> 08:02.770
Maybe we need a sit down
with him at the prison.

08:03.940 --> 08:04.980
I'm gonna give them a call.

08:05.020 --> 08:06.110
Good thinking.
Let's make it fast.

08:06.150 --> 08:08.280
The cops are probably
already on it.

08:09.820 --> 08:11.400
Look, I'm really sorry about
this people.

08:11.440 --> 08:12.820
But you're gonna
have to just stick with me

08:12.860 --> 08:14.030
just a little longer.

08:14.070 --> 08:15.280
And we're gonna get through this
alive. Okay?

08:16.410 --> 08:17.950
But the bomb.
It won't stop beeping.

08:17.990 --> 08:18.910
Lady.

08:18.950 --> 08:19.950
You wanna just chill?

08:20.000 --> 08:21.370
Stay!
Where are you going?

08:21.410 --> 08:23.580
I'm just gonna calm her down,
so you can stay calm.

08:23.620 --> 08:24.540
Okay. Okay.

08:24.580 --> 08:25.960
Calm her down.
Thank you.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.000
Oh my God.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.460
Come here.
Sit down.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.550
Okay.
Look at me.

08:30.590 --> 08:32.550
[Jake] He does not want to
blow himself up. Okay?

08:32.590 --> 08:33.930
Okay. But we really
need to do something.

08:33.970 --> 08:35.340
Because I don't want to die!

08:35.390 --> 08:37.140
You call this calming her down?
Come on!

08:37.180 --> 08:38.510
Uh. Mister Bomb Man.

08:38.560 --> 08:40.140
I could try. Because--

08:40.180 --> 08:41.020
I've been in a situation
like this recently.

08:42.060 --> 08:45.230
And, by recently,
I mean right now.

08:47.230 --> 08:49.570
Look lady.
I'm really sorry.

08:49.610 --> 08:50.860
There's just no other way.

08:50.900 --> 08:51.900
No, no, no.

08:51.940 --> 08:53.150
Oh my God.
Don't shoot me! Please.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.030
[Charles]
I'm not gonna

08:54.070 --> 08:55.070
shoot you.

08:55.110 --> 08:56.030
I just don't
wanna hear your mouth.

08:56.070 --> 08:56.990
Please. Let's go.

08:57.030 --> 08:58.490
Out of the room.

08:59.660 --> 09:00.620
Go.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.870
Now I gotta find something.
And I don't trust you.

09:04.920 --> 09:05.870
So you're coming with me.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.250
If anybody here

09:07.290 --> 09:08.590
is thinking about making
a quick break for it.

09:08.630 --> 09:09.670
Think about it again.

09:09.710 --> 09:10.630
And you.

09:10.670 --> 09:11.630
Come here.

09:11.670 --> 09:12.800
Come here!

09:14.090 --> 09:15.180
Open that.

09:15.220 --> 09:16.300
Open that!

09:16.340 --> 09:17.300
Take it out.
Put it on!

09:18.760 --> 09:21.350
Today's your luck day, man.
You just hit the lotto!

09:21.390 --> 09:22.220
No, stay away from him.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.560
[Jake]
Tinny.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.770
Just give me the vest, okay.
Put the vest on me.

09:25.810 --> 09:26.810
[Des]
No. No. No. Jake.

09:26.850 --> 09:26.900
It's fine.

09:28.310 --> 09:30.900
I've been feeling a little
too safe lately anyways.

09:30.940 --> 09:32.440
Des.
Shut up.

09:32.480 --> 09:33.900
Please.
You can't make him do this.

09:33.940 --> 09:35.030
You wanna bet?

09:35.070 --> 09:35.990
Keep pushing me.

09:36.030 --> 09:36.950
Put it on!

09:36.990 --> 09:37.910
Okay.

09:37.950 --> 09:38.870
Do it!

09:38.910 --> 09:39.780
Okay.

09:44.700 --> 09:46.870
Des. What the hell
is he doing to you?

09:48.380 --> 09:48.670
[Charles]
Same as mine.

09:50.170 --> 09:53.130
If your heart rate spikes,
slows down, or flat lines--

09:54.050 --> 09:54.720
no French toast for you buddy.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.470
I was gonna order
French toast this morning.

09:57.510 --> 09:58.510
How did you know that?

10:00.350 --> 10:01.220
I'm thirsty.

10:02.010 --> 10:03.270
Can I get him some water?

10:03.310 --> 10:04.220
Yeah. Sure.

10:04.270 --> 10:05.180
Thanks.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.430
Me had her we're, uh--

10:06.480 --> 10:08.190
Well, not really.
But it would be nice.

10:09.190 --> 10:11.270
Heart monitor,
it's always on.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.650
Once I click this button,

10:13.690 --> 10:15.610
motion sensors--
They kick in.

10:15.650 --> 10:16.450
No, no no no.

10:16.490 --> 10:17.530
This guy is twitchy enough

10:17.570 --> 10:19.410
without having a bomb on him,
alright?

10:19.450 --> 10:20.410
He's got a point.

10:20.450 --> 10:21.660
If anything happens to him --

10:21.700 --> 10:23.450
Then he'll be
the first to know.

10:23.910 --> 10:25.000
Trust me.

10:28.710 --> 10:29.580
Okay, everyone.
Just stay calm.

10:30.540 --> 10:32.000
We'll be outta here in no time.

10:34.130 --> 10:35.460
Little strange man.

10:36.720 --> 10:39.550
Try to move
as little as possible.

10:39.590 --> 10:40.550
[beep]

10:44.430 --> 10:45.470
Don't talk.

10:47.390 --> 10:48.440
Strapping bombs to people.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.770
Taking control
of the police station.

10:49.810 --> 10:51.690
I'm telling you,
there's no way out man.

10:51.730 --> 10:53.820
I got a feeling this is all
about your brother.

10:53.860 --> 10:56.400
Do you ever shut up?
I gotta do this?

10:56.440 --> 10:57.860
Okay, what do I call you?
Alright, what's your name.

10:57.900 --> 10:58.860
I don't even know it.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.530
Charles Alomar.
And my brother?

11:01.490 --> 11:02.530
He didn't deserve
what he got.

11:02.570 --> 11:03.950
All he ever did
was look out for me.

11:03.990 --> 11:05.490
He looked out
for everyone.

11:05.540 --> 11:06.330
Okay, so how did your brother
end up in jail?

11:07.580 --> 11:09.120
Look, I'm just trying
to make small talk.

11:09.160 --> 11:10.120
So calm down, alright?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.170
The cops--

11:11.210 --> 11:12.130
They gotta
clear my brother's name.

11:12.170 --> 11:13.090
Then we'll be out of this.

11:13.130 --> 11:14.170
That's all you get.

11:17.460 --> 11:19.550
Ladies and Gentlemen.

11:22.340 --> 11:23.600
It would mean a lot to me

11:23.640 --> 11:24.930
if you could kindly

11:25.470 --> 11:26.890
remain very

11:27.560 --> 11:28.140
still.

11:28.680 --> 11:28.980
He's right.

11:30.060 --> 11:31.150
I know you're all
nervous and upset.

11:32.350 --> 11:35.320
But we need you
to stay calm and quiet.

11:36.980 --> 11:38.110
Especially you, Des.

11:38.860 --> 11:39.360
Ladies and Gentlemen.

11:40.950 --> 11:45.370
I just want you to know that I'm
going to do everything I can

11:45.410 --> 11:50.660
to not see you get blown
to little tiny bits.

11:50.710 --> 11:51.870
That is not who I am

11:52.710 --> 11:56.000
and I would die before I--

11:57.130 --> 11:59.340
Why don't we just
stand here quietly.

12:00.880 --> 12:01.800
Evidence.

12:03.050 --> 12:04.890
We're looking for
a small metal box

12:04.930 --> 12:06.640
about the size
of a bar of soap.

12:06.680 --> 12:09.730
You're gonna need a swipe card
to get inside here.

12:09.770 --> 12:10.600
I know that.

12:11.350 --> 12:12.770
You're not so smart huh?

12:15.480 --> 12:17.320
[beeping]

12:19.530 --> 12:20.320
[beeping]

12:21.450 --> 12:23.860
What the hell is this?
Did you do this?

12:23.910 --> 12:26.700
Yes b'y. I snuck down here,
shagged up the swipe card reader

12:26.740 --> 12:28.700
while you were staring at me
the entire time.

12:28.740 --> 12:30.960
I gotta get in that room.
Make it work.

12:32.160 --> 12:33.790
Believe me.
You want this thing to work.

12:33.830 --> 12:33.870
Do it!

12:35.580 --> 12:37.290
Looks like you need a pass code
to go along with the swipe card.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.840
I'd say the only people
with the code are the cops.

12:40.880 --> 12:42.880
And you drove every cop that was
in here out of the building.

12:42.930 --> 12:43.880
Remember?

12:43.930 --> 12:44.930
Shut up!

12:46.970 --> 12:48.390
Son of a--

12:48.430 --> 12:50.560
Look.
I'm sure we can call the cops.

12:50.600 --> 12:53.140
And try and get the code.
Just try and relax,

12:53.190 --> 12:54.230
alright pally?

12:57.230 --> 12:58.110
Move.

12:58.940 --> 13:00.110
Sergeant Bennett?

13:02.490 --> 13:04.030
Mal. I told you,
you can't be here.

13:04.070 --> 13:05.110
We got a job to do.

13:05.160 --> 13:06.570
My granddaughter
and my son are inside.

13:06.620 --> 13:07.740
I just want to be in the loop.

13:07.780 --> 13:08.700
How are they?

13:08.740 --> 13:09.910
Still no movement.

13:09.950 --> 13:11.200
In a way we're lucky
we got Jake in there.

13:11.240 --> 13:12.500
You should know.

13:12.540 --> 13:13.620
There's something off
with the brother angle.

13:13.660 --> 13:14.750
Charles' brother?

13:14.790 --> 13:15.870
Him wanting to clear his name,
you mean?

13:15.920 --> 13:17.170
The brother's dead.

13:17.210 --> 13:18.630
He fell down the stairs
at the prison last night

13:18.670 --> 13:19.750
and broke his neck.

13:19.790 --> 13:21.550
Yeah. I know.
We checked into it.

13:21.590 --> 13:24.220
It doesn't make any sense.
It was ruled an accident.

13:24.260 --> 13:27.260
So his brother's dead.
What's Charles really after?

13:27.300 --> 13:29.140
Honestly,
it could be anything.

13:29.930 --> 13:31.430
Justice after the fact?

13:31.470 --> 13:32.470
But either way.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.600
His brother's death

13:33.640 --> 13:35.020
could have sent Charles
over the edge.

13:35.060 --> 13:35.560
[ring]

13:36.230 --> 13:36.690
I gotta take this.

13:37.770 --> 13:39.480
I'll keep you posted
with what I can.

13:39.520 --> 13:40.570
We'll do the same.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.230
What's next?

13:43.280 --> 13:45.780
I think it's time we got to know
Charles a bit more intimately.

13:47.950 --> 13:49.330
Jake, what's going on in there?

13:50.370 --> 13:51.950
We got a bit of
a situation here.

13:51.990 --> 13:53.120
But good news.

13:53.160 --> 13:54.660
Charles and I,
we're ready to negotiate.

13:54.700 --> 13:55.580
What?
Negotiate?

13:55.620 --> 13:56.830
What are you doing?

13:56.870 --> 13:59.790
We need the pass code
to the evidence room.

13:59.830 --> 14:01.000
[Leslie]
You know I can't give you that.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.000
My legs are falling asleep.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.630
Des.
The motion detector is off.

14:05.340 --> 14:06.880
Oh right.
I forgot.

14:06.930 --> 14:08.180
[Charles]
Shut it.

14:08.220 --> 14:09.140
What's she saying?

14:09.180 --> 14:10.390
Hold on a sec.

14:10.430 --> 14:12.100
It's a soft no.
But I'm wearing her down.

14:12.140 --> 14:14.140
Jake, there's something up
with this guy.

14:14.180 --> 14:15.270
That brother
he's trying to clear?

14:15.310 --> 14:16.690
We just found out he's dead.

14:16.730 --> 14:17.940
So what's he really after?

14:17.980 --> 14:19.350
I can't worry about
that right now.

14:19.400 --> 14:20.400
But I'm telling you.

14:20.440 --> 14:21.480
If you don't give me
the pass code

14:21.520 --> 14:23.110
to the evidence room
pretty soon,

14:23.150 --> 14:24.740
there will literally
be no evidence room.

14:24.780 --> 14:25.820
Do you understand?

14:25.860 --> 14:27.150
Look, I can't
give in to his demands

14:27.200 --> 14:28.410
no matter what
the threat.

14:28.450 --> 14:29.820
Alright. Alright.
Tell you what.

14:30.530 --> 14:31.490
Give us the pass code.

14:31.530 --> 14:33.740
And we'll send out
four hostages.

14:33.790 --> 14:36.000
Who the hell said anything about
four hostages?

14:36.040 --> 14:38.250
Four hostages for the pass code.
It's a good deal.

14:38.290 --> 14:40.170
It's a good deal.
It's a good deal.

14:40.210 --> 14:41.330
Fine.

14:41.380 --> 14:43.210
But I want all the hostages
out the door

14:43.250 --> 14:44.460
before I give you anything.

14:44.500 --> 14:47.010
Just text me the pass code
to my cell phone.

14:47.050 --> 14:49.800
And I promise
you'll get those hostages.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.050
Trust me.

14:51.090 --> 14:52.390
Jake.

14:52.430 --> 14:54.140
Don't get blown up.

14:54.180 --> 14:56.980
Alright.
I'll--I'll try.

14:59.730 --> 15:02.820
Come on, Charles. Your turn.
Four hostages.

15:06.650 --> 15:10.160
You. You. You and you.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.370
Come on. Let's go. Go.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.780
Go. Get out.

15:14.030 --> 15:14.910
[phone message sound]

15:18.960 --> 15:20.250
Just gotta get my phone.

15:23.380 --> 15:24.460
Got it.

15:24.500 --> 15:25.670
[Charles]
Oh no, no, no. Mister

15:25.710 --> 15:25.750
I Wanna Be Smart.

15:27.170 --> 15:30.130
Memorize the pass code.
And put the phone back.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.720
Do it.

15:36.520 --> 15:36.890
Fine.

15:37.850 --> 15:39.480
Okay.
Now that we've got that.

15:39.520 --> 15:40.890
No, no, no, no.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.730
Please. What if I gotta
sneeze or something?

15:43.770 --> 15:46.070
I'll be right here,
Des. Just be still.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.320
I think I'm gonna be sick.

15:50.280 --> 15:51.530
You let some people go.

15:51.570 --> 15:53.030
Please.

15:53.070 --> 15:55.410
Please send me out too please.
I can't take this anymore!

15:55.450 --> 15:57.080
Charles.
She doesn't look very good, man.

15:57.120 --> 15:58.540
Just let her go,
alright?

15:58.580 --> 16:01.540
No one's leaving.
As a matter of fact.

16:01.580 --> 16:03.040
Both of you, let's go.
Come on.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.340
Go. Move!

16:10.170 --> 16:11.050
Hey buddy.

16:11.680 --> 16:12.760
[beep]

16:14.550 --> 16:15.470
Ladies and Gentlemen.

16:16.640 --> 16:18.600
I know you all probably
have the impulse

16:18.640 --> 16:20.140
to talk about
why you didn't get picked.

16:20.890 --> 16:23.100
But please remain still.

16:24.810 --> 16:26.270
And calm.

16:29.650 --> 16:30.780
This whole thing.

16:30.820 --> 16:32.450
It feels kinda off to me,
Charles.

16:32.490 --> 16:34.280
It's almost like you're not who
you're pretending to be.

16:34.320 --> 16:36.490
I've already told you.
Stop pushing me.

16:36.530 --> 16:38.120
Your story's starting
to crumble a bit too.

16:38.160 --> 16:39.660
I mean now that I know
that your brother's dead.

16:39.700 --> 16:41.080
You don't know anything.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.330
I think we should just do what
he wants and keep quiet.

16:42.870 --> 16:44.250
Okay, look.

16:44.290 --> 16:46.040
If you're doing this in memory
of your brother, fine.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.130
But there are easier ways
to prove that he's innocent.

16:48.170 --> 16:49.420
You realize that,
right?

16:49.460 --> 16:50.630
You should really
stop talking now. Okay.

16:50.670 --> 16:51.590
You don't know me.

16:51.630 --> 16:52.630
You don't know my problem.

16:52.670 --> 16:54.090
Look.
Do yourself a solid--

16:54.130 --> 16:55.510
Shut up.

16:55.550 --> 16:58.050
I can't help you, if you don't
tell me what you want.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.140
Please.
Stop making him nervous.

17:00.180 --> 17:01.060
Oh lordy--

17:01.100 --> 17:02.270
I don't need your help.

17:02.310 --> 17:04.190
I just need to get
into the evidence room.

17:04.230 --> 17:05.230
Go!

17:05.270 --> 17:06.190
Just go.

17:14.650 --> 17:16.320
You do realized that by hacking
into Charles's email,

17:16.360 --> 17:18.620
we're walking a fine line,
legally speaking.

17:18.660 --> 17:20.620
Good thing we aren't cops.
What do you see?

17:21.120 --> 17:22.080
The usual.

17:22.120 --> 17:23.330
Stuff from friends,

17:23.370 --> 17:24.790
family, an ex-wife.

17:24.830 --> 17:26.040
And, oh look.

17:26.080 --> 17:27.580
Here's an email
from his brother.

17:27.630 --> 17:28.840
Looks like he sent it
from prison.

17:29.420 --> 17:30.460
"Please Charles,

17:30.500 --> 17:32.510
don't get caught up
in my problems.

17:32.550 --> 17:34.010
I screwed up.
I'll face the consequences."

17:34.930 --> 17:35.800
He's admitting that he did it.

17:37.260 --> 17:38.550
He says he got caught up
delivering drugs for someone.

17:39.890 --> 17:41.680
Skimmed some off the top
and tried to sell them.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.930
Okay, if Charles knew
his brother was guilty,

17:43.980 --> 17:45.890
why is he pulling
this stunt today?

17:48.810 --> 17:49.820
It's not here.

17:50.610 --> 17:51.690
I can't find it.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.690
Listen, buddy.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.860
You're gonna have to prepare
yourself for the fact that

17:55.900 --> 17:58.320
whatever it is you're looking
for might not be here.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.330
No. No.
That's not the answer.

18:01.660 --> 18:02.700
I gotta think.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.540
Let's go back to where we were.
Let's go.

18:07.580 --> 18:08.920
Move.

18:08.960 --> 18:09.840
Move!

18:11.590 --> 18:13.090
I just...
It might still be in here.

18:13.130 --> 18:14.210
I just want this to be over,
please.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.050
No, no, no.
Come on.

18:15.090 --> 18:16.300
Let's just
forget about it.

18:16.340 --> 18:17.550
We'll figure it out later.
Let's go. Come on.

18:17.590 --> 18:18.510
Okay.

18:18.550 --> 18:19.430
Come on.

18:21.760 --> 18:21.850
Charles.

18:22.970 --> 18:24.560
I feel like
the only way out of this,

18:24.600 --> 18:26.810
is we just shut the bombs off
and then we all go home.

18:26.850 --> 18:28.310
That ain't happening.
It can't. Trust me.

18:29.860 --> 18:32.020
I don't feel good guys.
I can't take much more of this.

18:37.320 --> 18:38.240
Okay.

18:38.280 --> 18:39.200
[beep]

18:39.240 --> 18:40.410
Move it.

18:41.570 --> 18:42.740
What's wrong with you?

18:42.780 --> 18:44.160
You need to take this thing
off of him, now.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.660
Oh thank you.
I'd hug you, but then, you know,

18:45.700 --> 18:47.910
I'd get us all killed.
Now, having said that--

18:47.960 --> 18:50.040
That wouldn't be
a bad way to go--

18:50.080 --> 18:50.540
Hugging.

18:51.580 --> 18:53.300
I really think
I'm gonna be sick.

18:54.380 --> 18:56.170
Go in there.
Lie down.

18:56.210 --> 18:57.590
And don't puke everywhere.

18:58.380 --> 18:59.300
[Des]
Jake.

18:59.340 --> 19:00.380
You gotta get this thing off me.

19:00.430 --> 19:03.050
Okay?
It's causing irreparable damage.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.430
Irreparable.
Seriously.

19:04.470 --> 19:05.930
It's too much for one man.
Even a man like me.

19:05.970 --> 19:08.230
I work out at Goodlife Fitness.
Like, every single day.

19:08.270 --> 19:09.520
Okay.
You should sit down.

19:09.560 --> 19:11.150
Shut him up!

19:11.190 --> 19:12.560
No! No! No shut up!

19:12.610 --> 19:13.980
Do not shut up.

19:14.020 --> 19:15.530
No! Someone needs
to take a stand.

19:15.570 --> 19:16.530
[beep beep beep]

19:16.570 --> 19:17.860
Except my legs hurt too much.

19:17.900 --> 19:18.820
Des.
Your heart rate.

19:18.860 --> 19:20.110
Breathe.

19:20.150 --> 19:21.990
Des. Listen to her.
Your heart rate, okay.

19:22.030 --> 19:23.280
You just gotta calm down.

19:23.320 --> 19:24.870
Breathe. Buddy will get
that thing off you.

19:24.910 --> 19:25.830
Give us a break.
Please.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.540
I can't do nothing.
Sorry.

19:28.580 --> 19:30.000
I'm losing it.
I'm losing it.

19:30.040 --> 19:31.620
Okay, I'm getting itchy and--

19:31.670 --> 19:34.040
And I smell peaches.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.090
Is it a heart attack?

19:36.130 --> 19:37.260
Des, get it together.

19:40.220 --> 19:42.430
Oh. Awesome.

19:44.970 --> 19:45.890
He's fainted.

19:45.930 --> 19:47.220
I was trying to calm him down.

19:47.270 --> 19:48.390
Jake
His heart rate.

19:48.430 --> 19:49.350
It's dropped.

19:49.390 --> 19:50.810
Okay.
Everybody take cover!

20:10.370 --> 20:12.710
Jake.
Why were you on top of me?

20:12.750 --> 20:15.000
Was I cold?
That's so thoughtful of you.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.960
The bomb.
It didn't go off.

20:22.680 --> 20:23.430
You were bluffing.

20:24.180 --> 20:25.390
So, I'm not gonna die?

20:25.430 --> 20:27.300
Wait a minute.
Did you just kiss me?

20:27.350 --> 20:29.020
'Cause I can't remember.
And that's so not fair.

20:29.060 --> 20:30.270
Not a good time, Des.

20:32.310 --> 20:33.690
Alpha team!

20:33.730 --> 20:35.900
Prepare to breach the south
entrance on my command.

20:35.940 --> 20:36.480
Beta team.
West entrance.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.860
This who thing is a scam,
alright.

20:39.900 --> 20:41.610
So shut that off.
I know it's a fake.

20:42.530 --> 20:44.820
The heart thing.
That's bull.

20:45.950 --> 20:48.790
But the bomb is as real
as the gun.

20:48.830 --> 20:50.250
So back the hell

20:50.290 --> 20:51.330
off!

20:53.080 --> 20:54.000
Yeah.

20:55.370 --> 21:00.800
Okay. Oh. Look.
Stop talking.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.130
Stop talking.

21:02.170 --> 21:04.890
Look. You gotta call
that blondie cop.

21:05.550 --> 21:06.890
You gotta tell her

21:06.930 --> 21:07.800
she gotta pull back whatever
she's sending in here.

21:09.260 --> 21:11.680
Who's that chatting to you
in your little ear, there?

21:11.720 --> 21:13.680
Look, just do it.
Do it now. Go on.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.060
Look, they're tapped
into all the cameras.

21:15.100 --> 21:16.690
They can see everything.

21:16.730 --> 21:19.190
They're gonna blow up the place
if they see cops swarming in.

21:19.230 --> 21:20.650
Please, just do it!

21:26.570 --> 21:28.740
Jake?
The SWAT team's inside now.

21:28.780 --> 21:30.030
They'll be there
in a few seconds.

21:30.080 --> 21:30.990
[Jake]
Okay, listen.

21:31.040 --> 21:31.620
You can't.
Alright?

21:33.290 --> 21:36.210
Apparently he's got a partner
with his finger on the trigger.

21:36.250 --> 21:38.790
If he sees the cops get in here,
we're all dead.

21:38.840 --> 21:39.880
Hold on.

21:39.920 --> 21:42.090
Alpha team.
Stand down immediately.

21:42.130 --> 21:44.970
Repeat. Stand down
and get out of the building now.

21:45.010 --> 21:47.510
Jake. Quickly.
Alomar's brother is guilty.

21:47.550 --> 21:49.050
He sent him
a letter from prison.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.010
What?

21:51.760 --> 21:53.600
You already know
that your brother is dead.

21:53.640 --> 21:54.690
And that he was guilty.

21:55.850 --> 21:56.900
[bang]

21:58.100 --> 21:58.980
Hey! Hey! Hey!

22:00.520 --> 22:02.860
This phone was, like, three
weeks away from retirement.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.450
You and your cop buddy
better not be making any plans

22:07.490 --> 22:08.700
to screw this up for me.

22:09.450 --> 22:10.740
Everybody.
Everybody

22:10.780 --> 22:12.080
shut up!

22:12.120 --> 22:12.700
I need to think.

22:13.700 --> 22:15.500
I'm gonna go out
into the hallway.

22:15.540 --> 22:17.000
I can see everything.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.170
I can see everything
going on in here.

22:18.210 --> 22:19.290
Don't forget.

22:19.330 --> 22:20.420
I got this.

22:22.630 --> 22:23.800
And this!

22:27.170 --> 22:29.760
Alright. I gotta go out there
and try to calm him down.

22:29.800 --> 22:32.100
He's got an earpiece.
I need you to hack into it.

22:32.140 --> 22:33.520
Find out who's talking to him.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.930
Okay. Well--

22:34.970 --> 22:36.810
we're really close right now,
in, like, every way.

22:36.850 --> 22:37.980
We're on it.

22:38.020 --> 22:39.520
And if you kiss him again.
I swear.

22:40.440 --> 22:41.860
I'll trigger that bomb myself.

22:43.820 --> 22:44.730
Okay.

22:44.780 --> 22:45.900
Okay.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.030
If I create a distraction,

22:49.070 --> 22:50.780
You think you can get
to that walkie-talkie?

22:52.030 --> 22:54.040
Okay. You get his attention.
I'll grab it.

22:54.080 --> 22:55.700
Okay. Wait. Wait.

23:04.630 --> 23:06.130
Come on, already.
Leave me alone.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.010
I think that you had no idea

23:09.050 --> 23:11.300
that that bomb's trigger wasn't
connected to your heart rate.

23:11.340 --> 23:11.720
Did you?

23:12.890 --> 23:13.970
Which tells me
that you're not the one

23:14.010 --> 23:16.140
who's in control
of this situation.

23:16.180 --> 23:18.180
You knew
that your brother

23:18.230 --> 23:19.890
was guilty.
And that he's dead.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.350
Shut up about my brother,
okay?

23:21.400 --> 23:22.770
I'm just trying to help you,

23:23.900 --> 23:25.980
so we can all
walk outta here alive.

23:29.450 --> 23:30.410
Tell me.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.370
Who's whispering in your ear?

23:34.700 --> 23:37.160
There's camera's
all over the place, okay?

23:37.200 --> 23:39.710
If he sees me talking to you,
he's gonna

23:39.750 --> 23:41.290
blow this place
up to bits.

23:41.750 --> 23:42.630
Who's he?

23:43.420 --> 23:44.840
And how can we stop him?

23:46.130 --> 23:48.920
Look he has my wife.
Actually my ex-wife.

23:50.260 --> 23:52.840
Look, we just have to
do what he says, alright.

23:52.890 --> 23:53.760
So whatever it is you're doing,

23:54.760 --> 23:56.350
could you please stop it,
already?

23:56.390 --> 23:58.850
You're gonna get us killed.
And my ex-wife.

23:59.390 --> 24:00.520
[fire alarm]

24:00.560 --> 24:02.020
What the hell?
What the hell was that?

24:02.060 --> 24:03.150
Move. Move. Move.

24:03.690 --> 24:04.690
Where is he?

24:04.730 --> 24:05.690
Where is he!?

24:05.730 --> 24:07.190
Did you set off the alarm?

24:07.230 --> 24:09.360
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I tripped.

24:09.400 --> 24:10.740
I'm all legs and upper back.

24:10.780 --> 24:12.860
You idiot.
Fix it! Now.

24:12.910 --> 24:13.820
I can't. I tried to close it.

24:13.870 --> 24:14.620
But it's heavy.

24:14.660 --> 24:15.870
Look,

24:15.910 --> 24:17.790
You're really
messing this up for me, okay.

24:17.830 --> 24:18.950
Cut it out.

24:18.990 --> 24:20.370
[Jake]
The phone is ringing, okay.

24:20.410 --> 24:21.210
It's probably the cops.

24:21.250 --> 24:22.290
Answer it.

24:22.330 --> 24:23.830
They can likely
turn off the alarm.

24:25.710 --> 24:27.880
You gotta do something
about this.

24:27.920 --> 24:29.630
Talk to me.
Is everything okay in there?

24:29.670 --> 24:30.880
[Charles]
The good news is,

24:30.920 --> 24:33.220
there's no fire,
if that's what you mean.

24:33.260 --> 24:34.720
The bad news is,

24:34.760 --> 24:38.390
there will be one if you keep
this up. You got it?

24:39.770 --> 24:40.770
[alarm stops]

24:43.940 --> 24:47.230
This time.
Nobody follow me.

24:47.270 --> 24:48.360
Especially you.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.090
Charles ex-wife.
Julie Cameron.

25:08.130 --> 25:09.340
I got her picture off his email.

25:09.380 --> 25:10.340
When you called her office,

25:10.380 --> 25:11.550
they said
she was off sick today.

25:11.590 --> 25:12.920
She didn't show up.
She didn't even call.

25:12.970 --> 25:14.720
No way that's a coincidence.

25:14.760 --> 25:17.350
I think we need to pay the
former Mrs. Alomar a visit.

25:17.390 --> 25:18.300
Already got her home address.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.260
Of course you do.

25:24.140 --> 25:25.520
[Des]
Charles' earpiece

25:25.560 --> 25:27.360
must be receiving an unlocked
signal from somewhere.

25:27.400 --> 25:28.560
Now I tried

25:28.610 --> 25:30.530
pulling in
all the channels on the walkie.

25:30.570 --> 25:31.570
But no luck.

25:31.610 --> 25:32.820
So you got to remove
the limiter?

25:32.860 --> 25:34.240
Yeah. Exactly.
If I could

25:34.820 --> 25:35.780
pop this off.

25:35.820 --> 25:37.200
And pull out the limiter.

25:37.240 --> 25:38.660
Then we can pull in any
frequency that we can find.

25:39.990 --> 25:41.540
That's actually cool,
if you can pull it off.

25:42.160 --> 25:43.290
Got it. Got it.

25:43.330 --> 25:44.660
[walkie tunes
to different frequencies]

25:45.420 --> 25:45.790
Just go back to that.

25:47.080 --> 25:48.330
[distorted voice on walkie]
Come on Alomar.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.460
Keep it together.

25:49.500 --> 25:50.340
Or else you know
what will happen.

25:50.380 --> 25:51.800
Turn it down.

25:51.840 --> 25:54.380
Now go finish what you started
and get me what I need.

25:55.300 --> 25:56.050
It doesn't sound like a partner.

25:56.970 --> 25:58.340
More like a boss or something.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.550
I think I can bring
Charles on side.

26:01.010 --> 26:03.390
I just need to get him away from
where these cameras are.

26:03.430 --> 26:04.560
I know the perfect spot.

26:08.350 --> 26:08.520
Okay.

26:09.730 --> 26:11.900
Where's this mysterious spot,
smart guy?

26:11.940 --> 26:14.860
It's uh. Right over--

26:14.900 --> 26:15.900
here!

26:16.360 --> 26:17.320
Ugh!

26:19.530 --> 26:20.830
[Jake]
Alright.

26:20.870 --> 26:22.240
We're gonna be doing things a
little differently

26:22.290 --> 26:23.160
from here on in.

26:23.620 --> 26:24.580
Got me?

26:25.330 --> 26:26.210
[Charles]
Yeah.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.380
You know.
It's not fair.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.000
This guy pulling
all this on us.

26:32.040 --> 26:34.510
And now, if he doesn't find what
he's looking for,

26:34.550 --> 26:35.590
then what?

26:36.550 --> 26:38.090
You're freaking people out.

26:38.130 --> 26:41.050
He's not even wearing a mask.
What do you think that means?

26:41.550 --> 26:42.600
This can't

26:42.640 --> 26:44.100
end well.
Oh jeez...

26:44.140 --> 26:46.140
My friend hit his head
when he fainted.

26:46.180 --> 26:48.810
So just ignore him.
And try to remain calm.

26:48.850 --> 26:50.940
The guy can't see you, okay?
There's no cameras in here.

26:52.070 --> 26:54.280
Please don't.
They'll kill my wife.

26:54.320 --> 26:55.650
And if we try anything,

26:55.690 --> 26:57.530
he'll press that button
before we're out the door.

26:58.860 --> 27:00.660
I'm gonna take my arm
off your throat.

27:01.620 --> 27:03.490
You think about trying anything.

27:03.530 --> 27:04.490
Remember.

27:04.540 --> 27:05.700
Who's got the gun now.

27:07.120 --> 27:08.710
Look. They kidnapped my wife.

27:09.540 --> 27:11.750
I mean, my ex-wife, Julie.

27:12.340 --> 27:13.590
The earpiece.

27:13.630 --> 27:15.960
They just give me
instructions through it.

27:17.380 --> 27:19.430
Who's they?
What do they want?

27:19.470 --> 27:21.220
Bennett.
You better get a look at this.

27:23.050 --> 27:24.470
What's going on in there?

27:24.510 --> 27:26.810
[Hood] Looks like the
hostages are getting restless.

27:27.600 --> 27:28.850
It's almost like --

27:30.560 --> 27:32.400
Like we need to jump him.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.070
Together.
He can't stop all of us.

27:34.110 --> 27:34.860
And otherwise,

27:35.400 --> 27:37.360
we are dead!

27:37.400 --> 27:37.900
And where does that get us?

27:39.030 --> 27:41.910
Nobody's jumping anyone.
You hear that?

27:41.950 --> 27:44.280
No one's jumping him.
Jake will take care of it.

27:44.320 --> 27:47.080
No, I know Jake
better than anyone.

27:47.120 --> 27:49.160
And I feel as though
he would want us to

27:49.210 --> 27:50.120
take action!

27:50.160 --> 27:51.080
Oh dear--

27:51.120 --> 27:52.170
Lord. What am I saying?

27:52.210 --> 27:53.540
Shut up.

27:53.580 --> 27:54.960
You 're making things worse.

27:55.000 --> 27:57.840
I know.
I am just freaking out.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.470
I don't know who they are.
They just grabbed me.

27:59.510 --> 28:00.670
They drugged me.

28:00.720 --> 28:02.590
And I woke up
with this freaking vest on.

28:05.930 --> 28:07.310
What do they want from you?

28:07.350 --> 28:08.680
[muffled arguing
from down the hall]

28:08.720 --> 28:09.640
You hear that?

28:09.680 --> 28:11.140
Charles.
You gotta focus.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.600
Look.
Something is going on.

28:12.640 --> 28:16.610
We gotta get back there.
He can see the cameras. Please.

28:16.650 --> 28:18.190
[Des]
I'm freaking out!

28:18.230 --> 28:19.280
Just wait.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.040
For the cameras.

28:28.370 --> 28:30.290
Go. Go!
Come on!

28:31.620 --> 28:32.460
If Charles comes back.

28:33.670 --> 28:36.040
and those hostages
try something stupid,

28:37.630 --> 28:39.760
this whole thing could go
sideways in a hurry.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.510
Bennett, I know you
don't want to hear this,

28:41.550 --> 28:43.010
but snipers
are in position.

28:44.890 --> 28:46.890
[Leslie] I was hoping it
wouldn't have to come to this.

28:48.970 --> 28:50.560
Snipers.
Be ready.

28:50.600 --> 28:51.770
But no one fires
without my okay. Got me?

28:53.270 --> 28:55.690
Together, with me as your
leader, we have the strength--

28:55.730 --> 28:56.650
Argh.

28:56.690 --> 28:58.020
[Charles]
You gotta stop.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.440
You don't understand.
The cameras.

28:59.480 --> 29:00.690
What the hell happened?

29:00.730 --> 29:02.530
I don't know.
It's all happened so fast.

29:02.570 --> 29:05.200
All the bombs.
And the guns. And the hostages.

29:05.240 --> 29:06.240
And some are fake
and some are real.

29:06.280 --> 29:07.780
I'm freaking out.

29:07.830 --> 29:09.700
Okay, everybody just relax.
Okay? You gotta listen to me.

29:10.910 --> 29:13.370
We need to do exactly what
Charles says.

29:21.880 --> 29:23.760
This is it.
The ex-wife's house.

29:23.800 --> 29:25.180
Looks pretty quiet to me.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.520
[knocking]

29:36.600 --> 29:38.150
[knocking]

29:39.270 --> 29:40.650
Maybe we should
take a look inside.

29:47.870 --> 29:48.780
Julie?

29:49.200 --> 29:49.410
Wait.

29:50.620 --> 29:51.580
We don't know
that she's alone in there.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.500
Call the cops now.

29:53.540 --> 29:56.000
If he sees you, he's gonna
trigger off the bomb.

29:56.040 --> 29:58.500
He's gonna blow us all up.
You just gotta listen.

29:58.540 --> 30:00.630
Stop it! Stop it!

30:00.670 --> 30:02.920
Jake? Do you see that?

30:06.130 --> 30:07.220
Charles!

30:07.260 --> 30:08.300
[gunshot]

30:11.350 --> 30:12.260
I've been shot.

30:12.310 --> 30:13.520
I've been shot.

30:13.560 --> 30:14.480
Come on.

30:14.520 --> 30:15.390
Come on.

30:18.350 --> 30:18.980
Who the hell shot that?

30:19.940 --> 30:22.030
Tinny!
Get the first aid kit!

30:24.110 --> 30:27.110
That bullet coulda blown
my brains out. Ahh!

30:27.570 --> 30:28.660
Listen.

30:28.700 --> 30:29.780
We're not going
to be able to move you

30:29.820 --> 30:30.740
until we figure
out a way to

30:30.780 --> 30:31.700
stop this --

30:31.740 --> 30:32.660
[beep]

30:32.700 --> 30:33.370
--bleeding.

30:34.120 --> 30:35.330
You gotta be kidding me.

30:35.370 --> 30:36.540
Jake.
The timer's counting down.

30:36.580 --> 30:37.830
Why is the timer counting down,
Jake?

30:39.250 --> 30:41.090
I have bandages, gauze.
Jake what are we gonna do?

30:41.790 --> 30:41.840
What's going on, guys?

30:43.500 --> 30:46.050
I think it's safe to say that
your trigger man is on to us.

30:55.430 --> 30:56.390
What happened?

30:56.430 --> 30:57.600
Oh my God.
Is he dead?

30:57.640 --> 30:58.100
No. Get down.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.440
Jake. That bandage won't hold
if we move him.

31:01.480 --> 31:03.020
We just need
to keep pressure on the wound.

31:03.060 --> 31:04.230
Charles. If this timer
was set off on purpose,

31:05.780 --> 31:08.280
the person behind this is upping
the game to another level.

31:08.320 --> 31:08.700
What bout Julie.

31:10.110 --> 31:11.740
See if you can remember anything
that might help us.

31:11.780 --> 31:13.030
Think. Now. Come on.

31:13.080 --> 31:16.330
I know when I put the key
in the lock to my house,

31:16.370 --> 31:17.620
everything went black.

31:17.660 --> 31:18.790
He must have followed me home.

31:19.170 --> 31:20.120
Ahhh!

31:20.170 --> 31:21.580
Did you get
a good look at him?

31:22.790 --> 31:25.000
He was wearing a mask.
Had a weird voice.

31:29.880 --> 31:32.510
Julie doesn't deserve this.
This is all my fault.

31:33.390 --> 31:34.430
How about the Evidence Room?

31:35.390 --> 31:36.810
Any idea
what he was looking for?

31:36.850 --> 31:41.690
Like I told you.
A small metal box. I don't know.

31:41.730 --> 31:42.810
Yeah.

31:42.850 --> 31:45.070
Is the trigger happy sniper
gone home?

31:45.110 --> 31:46.610
Or is it okay to stand up yet?

31:46.650 --> 31:48.190
It's fine. I'm sorry.
The sniper shot without orders.

31:48.740 --> 31:50.030
What's happening?

31:50.070 --> 31:51.610
Things have kind of gotten
out of control.

31:51.660 --> 31:54.070
There's a timer on his vest.
He's gonna blow him to bits.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.160
How much time do we have?

31:55.200 --> 31:55.990
Four minutes.

31:56.040 --> 31:56.080
Listen.

31:57.330 --> 31:59.330
The person who's behind this
whole thing

31:59.370 --> 32:01.170
has Charles' wife held captive.

32:01.210 --> 32:01.620
Find that location,

32:02.710 --> 32:03.790
and I'm pretty sure
you'll be able

32:03.830 --> 32:05.340
to shut the timer
down from that end.

32:05.380 --> 32:06.880
We got a team on the way
to her house now.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.670
Malachy and Rose
tracked her down.

32:09.260 --> 32:09.880
Try and hold on.

32:11.300 --> 32:12.720
Charles buddy. It's gonna be
hard to move you, man.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.470
Is it bad?

32:14.510 --> 32:15.930
Should I start clearing
the hostages out of here?

32:15.970 --> 32:18.350
No. I mean, the trigger man.
He would spot that, right?

32:19.600 --> 32:20.020
Yeah, well we're going to have
to risk it.

32:21.390 --> 32:23.650
Tinny, gather everyone up
and get them out of here.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.360
I need to move
Charles somewhere safe.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.820
Where is the safest place
in the station?

32:31.860 --> 32:33.360
The evidence room is the oldest
part of the building.

32:33.410 --> 32:34.570
It's all concrete.
Even the doors are reinforced.

32:34.620 --> 32:36.070
Perfect.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.830
You know, if this bomb goes off.
It's gonna kill everybody.

32:37.870 --> 32:39.660
You're gonna need some help.
So it's gonna be three of us.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.500
Guys,
I'm so sorry about this.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.370
Don't worry about it.

32:43.420 --> 32:45.290
This has been a day
of some incredible ups

32:45.330 --> 32:46.590
and some horrific downs.

32:46.630 --> 32:48.300
Alright.
Are you ready to do this?

32:48.340 --> 32:49.630
Okay. Come on.

32:50.010 --> 32:50.920
Oh.

32:50.960 --> 32:53.010
Come on. Alright, let's go.

32:59.720 --> 33:00.640
This is it?

33:02.390 --> 33:03.310
Let's go.

33:04.480 --> 33:05.810
[bang]

33:07.480 --> 33:09.150
Clear the house.
It's gotta be here somewhere.

33:12.530 --> 33:13.530
Let's get her untied.

33:13.570 --> 33:14.660
[Malachy]
No, no, no, wait.

33:14.700 --> 33:15.660
Something's off here.

33:15.700 --> 33:16.570
Look at the wires.

33:20.410 --> 33:21.290
Bomb.

33:22.410 --> 33:24.370
Hood.
We need bomb squad here!

33:27.130 --> 33:28.040
Des, you got him?

33:28.090 --> 33:28.960
Yeah.

33:31.010 --> 33:32.130
Come here.
Sit down.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.600
Well. At least
we haven't blown up yet.

33:38.640 --> 33:40.100
Yeah, but the timer is still
counting down.

33:40.140 --> 33:40.600
Sixty seconds.

33:41.430 --> 33:42.560
Thirty until I wet myself.

33:42.600 --> 33:43.060
[ring]

33:44.060 --> 33:45.060
Leslie.
What's the situation?

33:45.100 --> 33:46.440
He's not there Jake.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.770
The ex-wife is alone
in the house strapped to a bomb.

33:48.810 --> 33:49.900
That doesn't make any sense.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.070
Des will you look for something

33:51.110 --> 33:52.480
to help get this thing off him?

33:52.530 --> 33:54.780
Maybe someone stole a blow
torch, got caught with it,

33:54.820 --> 33:55.950
and now it's
in the evidence room.

33:58.490 --> 34:00.580
If there's no one at the house.
I don't understand.

34:00.620 --> 34:01.870
Who's behind this whole thing?

34:01.910 --> 34:03.120
Jake.
Just get out of there.

34:03.160 --> 34:04.250
You're out of time.

34:05.540 --> 34:06.460
Charles.

34:07.210 --> 34:08.290
Earlier.

34:08.330 --> 34:10.500
You brought me
and Samantha down here.

34:11.500 --> 34:12.050
Why did you choose us?

34:13.420 --> 34:15.430
I chose you because
you were a pain in the ass.

34:16.680 --> 34:19.390
Samantha, because
he said she was losing it.

34:20.640 --> 34:23.060
Where is she right now?
Where is Samantha?

34:25.520 --> 34:26.850
One second, fellas.

34:28.270 --> 34:28.480
Samantha.

34:29.690 --> 34:30.570
You gotta turn off that timer.
Right now.

34:32.190 --> 34:35.280
Well, duh. I wouldn't want to
blow up myself now too, would I?

34:35.820 --> 34:37.160
[beep stops]

34:46.080 --> 34:47.750
Now. First things first.

34:48.330 --> 34:49.420
Dial the cops.

34:52.460 --> 34:53.420
You're gonna tell them

34:53.460 --> 34:54.710
that you will kill us all,

34:54.750 --> 34:56.090
if they come anywhere
near the building.

34:57.050 --> 34:58.550
And admit it was you all along.

34:59.590 --> 35:01.430
Charles.
You don't have to do that.

35:02.260 --> 35:03.510
Actually Charles, you do.

35:12.020 --> 35:13.520
Jake.
I need to know what's going on.

35:14.360 --> 35:15.150
This is Charles Alomar.

35:16.490 --> 35:19.030
Any of those officers
come near the building,

35:19.990 --> 35:21.450
I trigger the dynamite.

35:22.160 --> 35:23.490
Kill us all.

35:24.410 --> 35:27.830
This whole thing was my idea.

35:27.870 --> 35:29.460
[Leslie] Charles. That
doesn't make any sense.

35:30.210 --> 35:31.380
Put Jake on the phone.

35:31.420 --> 35:32.250
Hang up.

35:32.670 --> 35:33.590
Good.

35:35.130 --> 35:36.090
Good.

35:36.130 --> 35:37.170
Give me the phone.

35:40.590 --> 35:42.050
This shouldn't have been
so difficult.

35:42.090 --> 35:43.260
Now I have to improvise.

35:43.300 --> 35:45.390
Look. We'll help you find

35:45.430 --> 35:46.850
whatever it is
you're looking for.

35:46.890 --> 35:48.810
Okay? Then we can all
walk outta here.

35:48.850 --> 35:50.100
Alive.

35:50.140 --> 35:51.730
Oh, you're gonna
help me find it.

35:51.770 --> 35:53.480
And then we'll see about
the walking.

35:54.650 --> 35:56.860
Well. I'm all fired up.
Let's do this!

35:56.900 --> 35:57.820
[punch]

35:57.860 --> 35:58.780
What the--?

35:58.820 --> 35:59.990
Shut up.
Move.

36:00.820 --> 36:02.870
Come on.
Let's go.

36:05.620 --> 36:06.740
[Samantha]
Alright. You first.

36:07.660 --> 36:08.870
In the corner there's a switch

36:08.910 --> 36:10.250
it disables all the
surveillance cameras.

36:10.290 --> 36:11.170
Go.

36:14.590 --> 36:15.630
What is this?

36:16.380 --> 36:18.170
Good. Now. Get to it.

36:18.210 --> 36:19.170
Find my box.

36:19.670 --> 36:20.800
Come on.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.220
Did you have my brother
killed in prison?

36:22.260 --> 36:24.300
Your dumb ass brother
was my driver.

36:24.340 --> 36:25.930
And he made
deliveries for me.

36:25.970 --> 36:27.350
Oh, I'm sure your business
was real legit.

36:28.600 --> 36:30.480
As far as your brother knew,
it was, alright?

36:30.520 --> 36:32.640
Until he started poking around
and skimming my drugs.

36:32.690 --> 36:33.850
Are you trying to say my brother

36:33.900 --> 36:35.560
was trying to go into business
for himself?

36:35.610 --> 36:38.440
Yeah. With my product.
Alright?

36:38.480 --> 36:40.570
And so the idiot.
He parks his truck somewhere.

36:40.610 --> 36:41.950
And walks off to make a deal.

36:41.990 --> 36:43.360
And he sells
to an undercover cop.

36:43.410 --> 36:45.200
So your truck
is still out there.

36:45.240 --> 36:48.740
And I need the metal box
that has the GPS Unit inside.

36:48.790 --> 36:49.870
So that I can find my truck.

36:49.910 --> 36:51.000
[Jake]
You know.

36:51.040 --> 36:52.910
If the metal box
was logged as evidence,

36:52.960 --> 36:54.580
it would be
in the evidence room.

36:54.630 --> 36:55.590
But...

36:57.630 --> 36:59.010
if it was
inside something else,

37:00.300 --> 37:02.340
it could have been logged
as personal effects.

37:09.810 --> 37:10.770
Alomar.

37:12.890 --> 37:13.810
Walkman.

37:13.850 --> 37:15.350
Who still uses a Walkman?

37:21.110 --> 37:22.440
Is this what you're looking for?

37:22.490 --> 37:23.610
Yes. Give it.

37:25.570 --> 37:26.490
Now.

37:26.530 --> 37:27.490
Alright b'y.

37:28.370 --> 37:29.410
Now.

37:30.740 --> 37:31.700
You're welcome.

37:32.870 --> 37:33.910
Alright.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.290
Back into the Evidence Room
hotshots.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.250
Come on.
Go.

37:45.090 --> 37:46.640
Are cuffs really necessary?

37:46.680 --> 37:48.680
You got what you wanted.
Okay?

37:48.720 --> 37:50.680
Why don't we all just leave,
right now.

37:50.720 --> 37:52.470
Well, you're half right.
Because I did get what I wanted.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.310
But I'm going to be
the only one leaving.

37:55.350 --> 37:56.850
See that's just rotten,
missus.

37:56.900 --> 37:58.310
See, currently,
there's no record of me

37:58.360 --> 37:59.650
as anything but
an innocent hostage.

38:00.520 --> 38:01.610
The lone surviving hostage.

38:01.650 --> 38:03.190
You've got your GPS.

38:03.230 --> 38:06.240
By the time we get out of these
cuffs, you'll be long gone.

38:06.280 --> 38:08.370
Use me as the Patsy.
I'll take the fall.

38:08.410 --> 38:09.120
Just don't do it.

38:09.870 --> 38:10.950
It's nothing personal.

38:11.580 --> 38:12.620
[beeping]

38:19.710 --> 38:20.840
Oh my God.

38:20.880 --> 38:22.090
I don't even care
where you had that hid.

38:22.130 --> 38:22.880
That's deadly.

38:23.510 --> 38:24.880
Here, here, here.

38:26.050 --> 38:27.340
Okay.
Take these cuffs off and leave.

38:27.380 --> 38:29.260
No. No.
I can still help.

38:29.300 --> 38:31.810
Look, they got attached
with padlocks,

38:31.850 --> 38:32.760
metal bindings.

38:32.810 --> 38:33.890
There's no use, Jake.

38:33.930 --> 38:35.350
Just go, please.

38:35.890 --> 38:36.770
Don't move.

38:41.270 --> 38:43.270
Ma'am. Don't move.

38:43.320 --> 38:44.480
Put your hands
where I can see them.

38:44.530 --> 38:45.440
What happened in there?

38:45.490 --> 38:46.400
Where are the others?

38:46.450 --> 38:47.860
He just snapped.

38:47.900 --> 38:49.780
He said
he's gonna blow them all up.

38:49.820 --> 38:51.700
He says he wants revenge
for his brother.

38:51.740 --> 38:52.870
We need the bomb squad now.

38:52.910 --> 38:55.080
Scramble the bomb squad
and fire.

38:55.120 --> 38:56.790
I just managed to slip away.

38:56.830 --> 38:58.580
It's gonna blow any second.

38:58.620 --> 38:59.460
Oh my God.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.500
Those poor people.

39:00.540 --> 39:01.790
They were just trying
to help us.

39:08.340 --> 39:09.090
Des!
Get out of here.

39:09.130 --> 39:10.510
No! I'm here to help.

39:10.550 --> 39:12.680
Although I'm so scared,
all I can taste is aluminum.

39:12.720 --> 39:14.470
Look, there's no time, Jake.
Just go.

39:14.510 --> 39:15.680
This is all my fault.

39:15.720 --> 39:16.680
All of it.

39:17.390 --> 39:17.430
Sixty seconds.

39:18.810 --> 39:20.310
We're gonna get you out of
this thing, Charles.

39:21.900 --> 39:22.980
I was a bad husband.

39:23.020 --> 39:24.940
I was always distracted
by stuff.

39:25.690 --> 39:26.610
I can't blame my wife

39:26.650 --> 39:27.440
for leaving me.

39:27.490 --> 39:28.610
Yeah, no. Totally.

39:28.650 --> 39:29.950
I know exactly
what you're talking about.

39:29.990 --> 39:32.160
Seriously Jake.
You gotta go.

39:32.910 --> 39:33.780
One more.
One more!

39:36.370 --> 39:37.330
Got it!

39:37.370 --> 39:38.710
Ten seconds!

39:38.750 --> 39:39.620
Thank you!

39:44.040 --> 39:45.760
[explosion]

39:59.390 --> 40:00.480
We don't know
what happened in there.

40:00.520 --> 40:01.440
Try not to panic.

40:02.020 --> 40:03.020
Jake!

40:03.060 --> 40:04.270
It's okay.
We're okay.

40:05.860 --> 40:06.360
What about Julie?

40:07.230 --> 40:08.190
We got her.
She's fine.

40:08.230 --> 40:09.150
Charles isn't
doing so hot.

40:09.190 --> 40:10.530
He really needs
an ambulance.

40:10.570 --> 40:12.950
There was a woman.
She was the last one to escape.

40:12.990 --> 40:14.320
Where is she?
She was alone.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.830
Yeah. She's giving
her statement now.

40:17.830 --> 40:18.700
There!

40:23.790 --> 40:24.460
[Jake]
Samantha.

40:25.170 --> 40:26.920
It's over, Samantha.

40:26.960 --> 40:28.550
Samantha Kaye.
You're under arrest.

40:31.550 --> 40:33.340
You have no idea
what you're doing.

40:33.760 --> 40:34.680
Save it.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.570
Well, I didn't get blown up.
In case you care.

40:50.610 --> 40:51.690
Turn my back for a second

40:51.740 --> 40:53.110
and you're up to your
eyeballs in it.

40:53.150 --> 40:54.490
It's like looking after a two
year old

40:54.530 --> 40:55.910
for the last thirty years.

40:55.950 --> 40:58.370
I could use a change and a nap,
if you're up for it.

40:58.410 --> 40:59.330
Ew.

40:59.370 --> 41:00.290
Stop it,
you guys.

41:00.330 --> 41:01.580
I'm glad you're okay Jake.

41:01.620 --> 41:02.540
How's Charles' wife?

41:02.580 --> 41:03.750
[Malachy] Shaken up.

41:03.790 --> 41:05.330
But she got lucky.
The bomb was a fake.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.290
She's resting.

41:06.330 --> 41:07.000
[Jake] And the man himself?

41:07.040 --> 41:08.460
He'll be okay.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.300
Des and Tinny are still
with him at the hospital.

41:10.340 --> 41:12.840
He said that he owes you
his life. Twice.

41:12.880 --> 41:15.550
Yeah, well, he would have blown
us all up with him. So --

41:15.590 --> 41:16.300
[Leslie]
Jake.

41:16.340 --> 41:17.510
Can I have a word?

41:17.550 --> 41:19.890
Sorry Dad. Gotta go.
Hot girl takes priority.

41:32.940 --> 41:33.360
You scared the crap out of me.

41:34.990 --> 41:36.950
One of these days you're not
gonna make it out in one piece.

41:36.990 --> 41:38.370
Well, you might be right.

41:38.410 --> 41:40.450
I'm just happy that it turned
out the way that it did.

41:41.540 --> 41:43.120
We were gonna have
the day together.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.620
It wasn't exactly my fault,
Leslie.

41:44.660 --> 41:46.580
I mean, a guy showed up with
a bomb attached to him, so--

41:47.830 --> 41:49.380
There was something
I needed to tell you.

41:51.090 --> 41:52.050
I've been promoted.

41:53.590 --> 41:55.010
I found out yesterday
on my shift.

41:55.760 --> 41:57.300
The brass. The big wigs.

41:58.300 --> 41:58.510
They told me.

41:59.810 --> 42:03.230
I'm so proud of you.
That's, that's brilliant.

42:03.270 --> 42:04.350
Yeah.

42:04.390 --> 42:05.560
Wait Jake.

42:06.390 --> 42:08.310
It's a federal task force.

42:09.480 --> 42:11.820
Anti-terrorism.
I won't be running it.

42:12.730 --> 42:14.570
But I will be a senior director.

42:16.070 --> 42:17.070
They got a spot for me,
if I want it.

42:18.370 --> 42:21.700
Again. Amazing news.
Why aren't you smiling?

42:23.500 --> 42:25.330
It starts in a couple of weeks.

42:27.790 --> 42:30.540
And the job.
It's in Ottawa.
