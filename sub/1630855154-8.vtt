And the tragic part
is that by the time

49:29.401 --> 49:31.272
Madison reaches
this conclusion,

49:31.316 --> 49:35.059
Charlie's already in a really
difficult place with Troy,

49:35.102 --> 49:37.496
and it leads to her
having to make a sacrifice

49:37.539 --> 49:41.239
in order to protect what Madison
is building in PADRE.

49:41.282 --> 49:43.502
Don't give him
the location.

49:43.545 --> 49:44.982
It's not your choice,
Charlie.

49:45.025 --> 49:46.244
Yes, it is.

49:46.287 --> 49:48.159
Charlie!

Chambliss: In the aftermath
of Charlie's sacrifice,

49:59.779 --> 50:02.216
all of our characters
are very divided.

50:02.260 --> 50:05.263
You know, as much as this season
is about kind of family,

50:05.306 --> 50:07.961
we find this episode ends

50:08.005 --> 50:11.008
with that family being split up.

50:11.051 --> 50:12.748
I can't go back to PADRE
with you.

50:12.792 --> 50:14.359
I need you.

50:14.402 --> 50:16.143
I can't do this alone.

50:16.187 --> 50:18.450
Domingo: I wanted to make sure
that when she said,

50:18.493 --> 50:20.365
"I'm not going with you,"
that it was definitive.

50:20.408 --> 50:22.671
That's not "Oh, I'm just going
to go off for a while

50:22.715 --> 50:24.543
and I'll meet you
at another time.

50:24.586 --> 50:26.675
We'll get together again."
This is it.

50:26.719 --> 50:29.635
That division
has to be very clear.

50:29.678 --> 50:31.202
It has to be very hard

50:31.245 --> 50:32.638
and heartbreaking
for both of them.

50:32.681 --> 50:35.641
You're gonna have to.

50:35.684 --> 50:37.643
Because so much
has happened now,

50:37.686 --> 50:40.298
I think that
Madison realizes

50:40.341 --> 50:42.213
that it's probably
best for them

50:42.256 --> 50:44.041
to just go their separate ways.

50:44.084 --> 50:46.478
So, the end of this episode
really leaves

50:46.521 --> 50:48.262
all of our characters separated,

50:48.306 --> 50:51.309
all of our characters kind of
at their lowest points

50:51.352 --> 50:52.875
we've seen them
at this season,

50:52.919 --> 50:54.921
and that's not a place
that they want to be

50:54.964 --> 50:57.532
when they have Troy Otto
opposite them,

50:57.576 --> 51:00.796
kind of ramping up
for an attack on PADRE.
