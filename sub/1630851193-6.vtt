[grunts] And finally, due to
the upcoming summer solstice,

00:58.145 --> 01:01.496
I want to get my fortune read.

Ollie, it's your money, babe,

01:03.759 --> 01:08.024
but don't waste it on
fake stuff like fortune-telling.

01:08.068 --> 01:10.679
Hey there, little girl, can I
get your support to expose

01:10.722 --> 01:13.116
the lizard people in government?

01:13.160 --> 01:16.772
Lizard people? Like...
Sea Monkeys?

Well, for five dollars
I'll explain further.

I need you to develop

Your gullible nature is going

No fracking. No fracking.

Jesus, Dad, focus.

01:41.318 --> 01:43.538
It's Kelley Frakes' initiative.

01:43.581 --> 01:45.801
she plans to expand her fracking
here on the north side.

01:45.844 --> 01:48.543
And fracking
causes climate change. Yeah.

01:48.586 --> 01:50.632
Look, I-I know.
Everyone knows. Okay?

01:50.675 --> 01:52.460
But, I-I mean,
it's climate change,

01:52.503 --> 01:54.810
so it's no fun at all.
Look, I'm struggling.

01:54.853 --> 01:57.334
Kelley wants to expand fracking
into the creek,

where me and my friends
play with the turtles.

Or should I say, I play with
my only friend, the turtle.

on any dissent for the mayor's
fracking expansion,

02:53.999 --> 02:56.611
a local boy
makes a scene at the capitol.

02:56.654 --> 02:58.134
Climate change is real.

There are facts,

Hi, y'all. As y'all's mayor,

03:03.270 --> 03:06.098
I'm out here trying to figure
out how to drum up

03:06.142 --> 03:08.884
some positive economic ventures.

03:08.927 --> 03:11.191
Understandable and relatable.

03:11.234 --> 03:14.672
The local boy, on the other
hand, is abrasive, alone, ugly.

03:14.716 --> 03:17.371
Plus, I mean, it's climate
change, so... snooze.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.984

Whatever. At least this outing
won't give me a headache.

Ollie, remember what I said
about that fake stuff, babe.

03:31.863 --> 03:34.170
You put your faith in it,
you're gonna be let down.

03:34.214 --> 03:37.826

Leaps of fact are homework.

Hi, I'm Joshathon,

03:48.358 --> 03:51.013
My parents buy our goods
on Amazon

03:51.056 --> 03:53.929
and sell them to you for
twice the price. [chuckles]

03:53.972 --> 03:57.585
Rad! See, everyone's here.

03:57.628 --> 03:59.326
If there's a sale, I'm there,

crystals and brass.

For a place that's supposedly
"at one with Mother Earth,"

04:04.200 --> 04:06.202
they sure
use a lot of plastic

04:06.246 --> 04:08.204

a shit-ton of trash.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.684

04:16.821 --> 04:18.954
But let's get some,
just to be sure, you know.

04:18.997 --> 04:21.348
Ah. I need this headache
to go away.

Black Forest of Germany

04:31.445 --> 04:32.794

You're into numerology.
I get it, so am I.

04:40.367 --> 04:41.890
Tell you what. I'll give
you a sample off yesterday's

04:41.933 --> 04:43.718
car-OOT for, like, $12.50.

04:43.761 --> 04:46.895
Well, okay. I'm sure you know
what you're talking about.

04:48.853 --> 04:52.988
Hey, little goddess, you have
a great taste in crystals.

04:53.031 --> 04:54.816
Those are our most expensive.

04:54.859 --> 04:56.208
If you listen
while you scratch at them,

04:56.252 --> 04:59.168
you can hear their
high-pitched, scratchy voices

04:59.211 --> 05:00.735
talking to you.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.389
Watch.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.826
Yes. I know. [laughs]

05:04.869 --> 05:07.089
So spiritual.

05:07.132 --> 05:09.221
My grandma says if we want to
get spiritual

05:09.265 --> 05:10.745
we should just go to church.

05:10.788 --> 05:12.529
Bullshit!
That's bullshit.

05:12.573 --> 05:16.098
It's so backwards and,
like, wrong and, like, stupid

05:16.141 --> 05:19.144
to believe in such old,
fake bullshit.

05:19.188 --> 05:21.103
Gross.

05:21.146 --> 05:24.106
Dad, there it is.
I want to do that.

05:25.760 --> 05:29.111
Jame, come here. I can't get
this damn thing to work.

05:29.154 --> 05:32.419
This is for thee to fix.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.421

Thy! Thy the chosen one!

05:37.554 --> 05:38.686
Look, Dad.

05:38.729 --> 05:40.514
That scary,
foreboding old crone is

05:40.557 --> 05:41.776
waving me over.

05:41.819 --> 05:43.125
Of course I should go, right?

05:43.168 --> 05:47.825
The fate of the world is
in your hands.

05:47.869 --> 05:52.308
Give me a hit off
my Monster. Where's my Monster?

05:52.352 --> 05:53.614
How?

05:53.657 --> 05:57.182
This town is located
on a vortex

05:57.226 --> 05:59.707
of converging,
magnetic ley lines.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.970
That's actually true,
geologically.

06:02.013 --> 06:04.668
And on the summer solstice,

06:04.712 --> 06:08.411
this town will line up
perfectly at midnight

06:08.455 --> 06:11.414
with the Pleiades
cluster of stars,

06:11.458 --> 06:14.069
thus temporarily making it

06:14.112 --> 06:17.246
a special spot on the planet.

06:17.289 --> 06:18.769
Holy shit, look at that.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.902
Checks out,
astronomically speaking.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.513
The world needs correcting.

06:23.557 --> 06:26.255
We are scattered, lost.

06:26.298 --> 06:29.127
The prophecies have foretold
that the only thing

06:29.171 --> 06:31.826
to keep the world from ending

06:31.869 --> 06:35.830
is the hope
of the new generation.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.266
Can't really argue with that.

06:37.309 --> 06:40.704
That hope is you.

06:40.748 --> 06:44.186
You must get everyone in town
to come together

06:44.229 --> 06:46.841
and partake of a great uniter.

06:46.884 --> 06:50.453
We need to partake
of someone who believes that

06:50.497 --> 06:53.935
we are the change we want to be.

06:53.978 --> 06:56.459
So, thy little one,

06:56.503 --> 07:00.115
you must get everyone
in this special town

07:00.158 --> 07:02.509
to eat a piece of...

07:02.552 --> 07:05.512
Barack Obama.

07:05.555 --> 07:07.470
[all gasp]

07:07.514 --> 07:10.299
Before midnight
on the summer solstice,

07:10.342 --> 07:13.084
or the world will end!

07:13.128 --> 07:14.869
[gasps]

07:14.912 --> 07:17.959
Tight. I got this!

07:18.002 --> 07:19.656
But what are we
all supposed to do?

07:19.700 --> 07:21.658
Partake of what?

07:21.702 --> 07:24.618
Well, it sounds like she wants
us all to take a bite of...

07:24.661 --> 07:27.490
I think Obama.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.405
No one can eat Barack Obama,

07:29.449 --> 07:31.059
let alone all of the town.

07:31.102 --> 07:32.930
And that's only 24 hours.

07:32.974 --> 07:35.193
That can't be real... can it?

07:35.237 --> 07:37.195
I don't know.
What if it is real,

07:37.239 --> 07:38.980
but we didn't try
to do anything?

07:39.023 --> 07:41.025
That's crazy. Eat Obama?

07:41.069 --> 07:42.549
A-And why Obama?

07:42.592 --> 07:44.594
Well, why not Obama?

07:44.638 --> 07:46.509
He is special.

07:46.553 --> 07:49.556
No, I mean, I get that if it's
anyone, it should be Obama.

07:49.599 --> 07:50.818
He's special.

07:50.861 --> 07:53.081
Even if this was
a real prophecy,

07:53.124 --> 07:54.996
I don't know how
you'd even start.

07:55.039 --> 07:58.826
I'd love to see Ollie try, real
or not, and it can't be real.

07:58.869 --> 08:01.176
Well, our crone did predict
the last election.

08:01.219 --> 08:02.743
And she is from
old, mystic Europe.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.179
I mean, we fly her back
and forth every night.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.355
Costs a fucking fortune in gas,
but it's worth it.

08:06.398 --> 08:08.705
[indistinct chatter]

08:11.142 --> 08:14.145
So we gotta stay fact-based
to end climate change,

08:14.189 --> 08:16.670
which is real
and proven by science.

08:16.713 --> 08:19.368
-Uh-huh.
-[both snoring]

08:19.411 --> 08:20.891
Guys, you're not going
to believe what's happened,

08:20.935 --> 08:22.850
and what's got to happen,
and what's going to happen

08:22.893 --> 08:24.939
-if it doesn't happen.
-Huh? What?

08:24.982 --> 08:28.377
So, a crone told my fortune,
free of charge,

08:28.420 --> 08:31.772
and she said I gotta get
everyone in town

08:31.815 --> 08:33.904
to eat a piece
of Barack Obama

08:33.948 --> 08:37.473
before midnight tomorrow,
or the world ends.

08:38.648 --> 08:41.738
-[laughter]
-Yeah.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.262
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard.

08:44.306 --> 08:45.307
[knock on door]

08:47.527 --> 08:50.051
We better get started,
chosen one.

09:00.627 --> 09:03.455
So, yeah. I mean, it's kinda
fun and exciting

09:03.499 --> 09:04.587
to believe in this.

09:04.631 --> 09:07.459
Not like climate change
or anything.

09:07.503 --> 09:10.680
Okay, I-I get Ollie believing
this, but all of you?

09:10.724 --> 09:13.204
Is this
some kind of sarcastic game?

09:13.248 --> 09:16.033
Katrina, come on,
you're too smart for this.

09:16.077 --> 09:17.513
I'm fifty-fifty.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.429
Fifty sarcastic,
the rest is curious.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.213
I want to see how far
this can go.

09:22.257 --> 09:24.564
What-- But what about
the rest of y'all?

09:24.607 --> 09:28.829
Uh, listen, we're talking about
coming together as a people

09:28.872 --> 09:30.961
to save our planet
from destruction.

09:31.005 --> 09:35.575
All we have to do is simply eat
President Barack Obama.

09:35.618 --> 09:38.055
Which is impossible and stupid.

09:38.099 --> 09:39.622
You're impossible and stupid.

09:39.666 --> 09:41.145
Freddie, say something.

09:41.189 --> 09:43.278
Well, you know, I did have
a headache from Todd

09:43.321 --> 09:45.497
-yelling about the climate.
-What?

09:45.541 --> 09:48.326
You see, then Jame sold me a
sliver of a blackened carrot,

09:48.370 --> 09:51.503
and that worked,
so, uh, maybe this will.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.070
Mm, pretty dumb, babe.

09:53.114 --> 09:54.419
Look, I know it's
a big stretch,

09:54.463 --> 09:56.421
but, I mean, what if it's not,
you know?

09:56.465 --> 09:58.510
Like, what if the world ends
and it's our fault because

09:58.554 --> 10:00.512
we didn't even do
the simplest thing?

10:00.556 --> 10:02.863
That is literally exactly what
I've been saying

10:02.906 --> 10:04.081
about climate change.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.170
Yeah, but this is now.

10:06.214 --> 10:09.260
Is the AC on? 'Cause it's,
like, 120 degrees.

10:09.304 --> 10:12.699
Guys, Even if you believe
this cockamamie prophecy,

10:12.742 --> 10:14.048
we cannot actually eat

10:14.091 --> 10:16.398
the 44th president
of the United States.

10:16.441 --> 10:19.009
-You can't eat anybody!
-Tonya!

10:19.053 --> 10:20.532
All I'm saying is
I'm open to it.

10:25.581 --> 10:27.670
Okay, Ollie,

10:27.714 --> 10:29.672
I'm going to let
you try to do this because

10:29.716 --> 10:33.284
I want you to learn a lesson
about being too gullible.

10:33.328 --> 10:36.636
And I'm going to be there
when it all crashes and burns.

10:36.679 --> 10:38.855
Awesome, Mom. Thanks.

10:38.899 --> 10:40.552
Here we go.

10:40.596 --> 10:42.424
[line ringing]

10:42.467 --> 10:44.644
Hello, little goddess.

10:44.687 --> 10:46.646
-Aunt Brenna!
-DEBBIE: Wait.

10:46.689 --> 10:49.866
-What-what are you doing?
-I'm saving the world, Mom. Duh.

10:49.910 --> 10:51.738
You're not going to believe
this, but I gotta get

10:51.781 --> 10:54.131

It's unfalsifiable!

And...

we succeeded in running down
the clock on fracking.

Todd, Debbie,
let me share something

with just the two of you.

22:04.061 --> 22:06.977
This whole time, all of this
was to distract Kelley,

22:07.021 --> 22:08.544
so that my people

22:08.588 --> 22:10.720
could get with some
climate-conscious billionaires

22:10.764 --> 22:12.592
who, if I'm not mistaken,

22:12.635 --> 22:14.855
have bought out
Kelley's fracking company

22:14.898 --> 22:17.858
while we were all distracted
with this nonsense.

22:17.901 --> 22:20.208
So the distraction was
a distraction?

22:20.251 --> 22:22.558
Bingo bongo, baby boyo.
[chuckles]

22:22.602 --> 22:25.953
So even though fracking now
is technically legal here,

she won't have a company
to act on it.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.220
Aw. I was worried
my daughter's nature

22:32.263 --> 22:34.396
would make her a victim one day,

22:34.440 --> 22:37.094
and it turns out her nature
makes her a cult leader. Ha-ha!

22:37.138 --> 22:39.096
Which is
kind of a relief, really.

You're fucking kidding
my ass right now, Mom.

it's a fine line
