33:52.090 --> 33:54.024
You're what's wrong
with our country, pal.

33:54.092 --> 33:56.424
You call that music?
[ Grunting]

33:56.494 --> 33:59.759
- What's going on there?
- First of all, what do you listen to, old-timer?

33:59.831 --> 34:02.322
Barbara Mandrell.
Nothing wrong with that.

34:02.400 --> 34:05.665
- Kenny G., Captain & Tennille.
- That's, like, too gangster for me right there, man.

34:05.737 --> 34:07.830
I got something foryou right here--
a melody.

34:07.906 --> 34:11.739
- Get this fool out my face.
- Oh. Oh. Oh, are these your gangstas?

34:11.810 --> 34:13.937
This is cool.
Am I gonna get whacked?

34:14.012 --> 34:16.446
I'm hip-hoppin' now, man.
Look at me.

34:16.514 --> 34:19.039
- [ Gun Cocks ]
- Bonjour.

34:21.085 --> 34:23.077
[ Grunting ]

34:23.987 --> 34:25.420
Uh-uh.

34:25.489 --> 34:28.152
Wanna take a ride, sugar bloomers?

34:49.547 --> 34:52.812
What the hell are you doing here?
Aw, come on, man.

34:52.884 --> 34:54.976
Go. Get in.

34:55.053 --> 34:58.284
- Move.
- What's up, man?

34:58.356 --> 35:00.950
- Get down! Get down!
- Eddie, Eddie, Eddie. Listen to me.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.894
All right? You don't have to do this.

35:03.962 --> 35:06.590
There's still time.
We can make this right.

35:07.699 --> 35:09.929
- No one needs to know.
- [ Laughs ]

35:10.001 --> 35:11.935
Yeah, I almost wish they did know.

35:12.003 --> 35:14.733
You couldn't have pulled offthat scam,
not in a million years.

35:14.806 --> 35:17.934
Thatwas beautiful.
Thatwas mine.

35:18.009 --> 35:20.978
I never did anything toyou.
Why areyou doing this to me?

35:21.045 --> 35:24.242
Oh, man. This is yourfault, Ricky.

35:24.315 --> 35:27.307
Why'd you have to push it?
Why'd you have to go to the feds?

35:27.385 --> 35:30.183
- Because it's notyour money.
- The hell it isn't!

35:30.255 --> 35:33.088
I built that company. Me!

35:33.158 --> 35:35.456
Valentine was rappin' for pocket change
when I met him.

35:35.527 --> 35:39.122
- I sold his CDs out ofa van.
- He trusted you. He loved you.

35:39.197 --> 35:41.665
Loved me?
He made a halfa billion dollars.

35:41.733 --> 35:45.362
Me? I'm a financialadviser
with a weeklypaycheck.

35:45.436 --> 35:48.564
Yeah. "Oh, here, Eddie,
take this car."

35:48.640 --> 35:51.973
"Eddie, you know what, have a watch."
Table scraps.

35:52.043 --> 35:53.874
You know,
between me andyou, Ricky--

35:56.347 --> 35:59.544
I don't even like the music anymore.
I can't stand it.

36:03.021 --> 36:07.151
I gotta say,
it feels good to do this myself.

36:07.225 --> 36:09.887
I should've stepped up like this
a long time ago.

36:12.864 --> 36:15.162
What the hell?

36:24.542 --> 36:27.067
Oh, no, no.
Oh, no, no, no.

36:27.145 --> 36:28.840
- Please.
- Everybody out.

36:28.913 --> 36:30.710
- Valentine.
- Except you, Eddie.

36:30.782 --> 36:33.216
No. Wait, wait.
[ Stammers ]

36:33.284 --> 36:36.651
Hey. Hey, man.
It's me, man. It's me.

36:36.721 --> 36:38.586
- Let's talk.
- Go ahead, talk.

36:38.656 --> 36:41.386
- It's not like it looks, man.
- Yeah, I see that.

36:47.565 --> 36:50.762
So your boy, Eddie, took a ride
with Valentine on his yacht.

36:51.970 --> 36:54.234
Didn't come back.

36:54.305 --> 36:58.708
And I believe I oweyou guys
a little more than "Thankyou."

36:58.776 --> 37:00.334
Oh, no. That's not necessary.

37:00.411 --> 37:03.869
On the otherhand,
Fi needs newshoes.

37:03.948 --> 37:06.041
Cover our expenses,
we'll call it even.

37:07.452 --> 37:09.750
- That work foryou?
- Mm-hmm.

37:09.821 --> 37:12.187
I'm not gonna forget this, Michael.

37:12.257 --> 37:15.090
You ever need anything--
I mean anything.

37:15.159 --> 37:17.753
Just say hello
to your brother for me.

37:20.832 --> 37:23.733
That's a deal.

37:28.106 --> 37:30.040
The incendiary rounds you asked for.

37:30.108 --> 37:32.872
Sounds likeyou're planning
quite a party.

37:32.944 --> 37:36.402
- You sure you don't need a date?
- Victor's an "invite only" type.

37:36.481 --> 37:39.746
He's willing to make a few corpses
just to get his hands on that box.

37:39.817 --> 37:41.842
I need to be able
to take a look inside...

37:41.919 --> 37:44.114
without him turning this thing
into a bloodbath.

37:44.188 --> 37:47.157
So shoot Victor and take a look.
What's the problem?

37:47.225 --> 37:49.159
I take out
one oftheir operatives...

37:49.227 --> 37:51.422
and then everyone I care about's
in danger, including you.

37:51.496 --> 37:53.521
No. I want this to go off
without a hitch.

37:53.598 --> 37:55.589
And that's where these come in?

37:58.469 --> 38:01.461
Just... wish me luck.

38:09.280 --> 38:12.647
- Cute gun.
- Look atyou.

38:34.572 --> 38:37.097
[Michael Narrating]
Notorious for causing brush fires...

38:37.175 --> 38:42.875
12-gauge incendiary. rounds create a small
explosion that burns at 3,000 degrees.

38:42.947 --> 38:45.347
It'll also stop a car pretty well.

38:45.416 --> 38:48.943
People don 't drive
when their tires are on fire.

38:49.020 --> 38:51.511
? Throwyour hands up
and say what ?

38:51.589 --> 38:53.989

- Hey! Hey!

38:56.794 --> 38:59.695
[ Michael Narrating ] Water sealant
is a common sight around Miami...

38:59.764 --> 39:02.699
where it's used to protect buildings
from hurricane flooding.

39:06.270 --> 39:11.367
It's also extremely flammable,
which means it can be useful in other ways too.

39:17.682 --> 39:19.809
? Are you ready for this

39:19.884 --> 39:22.682

I don't like your field tactics.

40:00.792 --> 40:03.158
I don't like your whining.
Are you gonna pout all night?

40:03.227 --> 40:06.685
A little harmless gunfire attracts
less attention than a double homicide.

40:06.764 --> 40:10.131
I warned you what would happen
ifyou pulled another stunt, Michael.

40:11.636 --> 40:15.970
But that one-- [ Laughing ]
had some style.

No. You know
whatyou're meant to know.

too much trouble, Mom.
