WEBVTT

00:02.035 --> 00:03.636
 ( bell rings )

00:03.670 --> 00:06.773
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.806 --> 00:09.676
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.709 --> 00:12.579
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.612 --> 00:15.982
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.015 --> 00:19.919
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.888 --> 00:24.891
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.924 --> 00:27.861
   <i>* And my dog ate</i>
   <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.894 --> 00:30.797
 <i>* Riding low in my chair</i>

00:30.830 --> 00:34.401

00:34.434 --> 00:37.971
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:52.952 --> 00:55.922

<i>'cause I'm saved by the</i>

00:55.955 --> 00:58.792

<i>'cause I'm saved by the</i>

00:58.825 --> 01:02.595
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:23.850 --> 01:26.086
   The three worst things
   that can happen to a kid,

01:26.086 --> 01:28.722
  are measles, mumps,
  and midterms.

01:28.755 --> 01:30.857
   I'd rather study
   measles and mumps.

01:30.890 --> 01:33.460
Our most dreaded midterm
is given by a man,

01:33.493 --> 01:36.529
 whose very name strikes fear
 in the heart of every student.

01:36.563 --> 01:37.897
  ( shouting )
  Terrible Testaverde!

01:37.931 --> 01:39.632
 ( all scream )

01:42.402 --> 01:44.838
 Zack Morris,
 don't mention that man's name.

01:44.871 --> 01:46.806
Oh, you mean...
( muffled )

01:48.508 --> 01:51.678
   Zack, I'm a nervous wreck.
   When I'm nervous I eat.

01:51.711 --> 01:53.847
Have a doughnut.
No, I need them.

01:56.716 --> 01:59.185
  She's a wreck?
  My streak is danger.

01:59.219 --> 02:02.055
  I have had straigh "A's"
  ever since <i>"Sesame Street".</i>

02:02.088 --> 02:04.524
  You mean you were
  a "Big Bird-brain"?

02:07.160 --> 02:09.662
  Hey,
  everyone deals with pressure
  in his own way.

02:09.696 --> 02:11.831
   All right, Morris.

02:11.865 --> 02:13.466
   Hey,
   you ready for today's bet?

02:13.500 --> 02:15.068
  You've lost three in a row.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.770
   I'll get you
   this time, Slater.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.806
 How about my sunglasses
 against your Swiss Army knife?

02:19.839 --> 02:23.076
   Okay, the game's the same.
   Here's your ammo.

02:23.076 --> 02:24.611
I found us a new target.

02:24.644 --> 02:25.945
Prepare to lose.

02:25.979 --> 02:27.647
 Uh-huh.
 Ready?

02:28.481 --> 02:30.116
  Go!

02:30.150 --> 02:32.085
 Hi, Zack.
 Zack: Screech?

02:33.787 --> 02:36.489
   Yes, I win again.

02:36.523 --> 02:38.425
Here's your five bucks,
Screech.

02:38.458 --> 02:39.926
   Thanks, Slater.
   Good job.

02:40.894 --> 02:41.795
Why were you the target?

02:41.828 --> 02:44.464
 I couldn't throw at a friend,
 you pinhead.

02:44.497 --> 02:46.666
   He's got your sunglasses,
   I've got five bucks,

02:46.700 --> 02:47.934
 and you've got diddly.

02:47.967 --> 02:49.903
 Sounds you're the ''pinhead,''
 pinhead.

02:52.539 --> 02:54.107
  Hey, you can't just
  win and walk.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.776
 Let's make a real bet,
 with real stakes.

02:56.810 --> 02:59.646
  Hey well, you know Zack,
  I could use your ham radio.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.549
   There's that gymnast
   I left behind in Germany.

03:02.582 --> 03:04.050
Phew! She really flipped
over me.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.752
  Enough. It's a bet.

03:05.785 --> 03:08.054
  It's my radio
  against your bomber jacket.

03:08.054 --> 03:09.789
   You're on.

03:09.823 --> 03:13.126
 I bet you that the next person
 to come down those stairs

03:13.159 --> 03:15.128
will be Kelly Kapowski.

03:15.161 --> 03:16.963
 You're going to lose this one.

03:17.063 --> 03:19.165
   I'm an expert on
   Kelly's schedule,
   and right now

03:19.199 --> 03:21.601
   she's walking into the gym
   for volleyball practice

03:21.634 --> 03:23.803
 and she wouldn't miss practice
 for the world.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.905
   Hi, guys.
   Anybody seen my sneakers?

03:25.939 --> 03:27.874
  I can't find them anywhere.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.610
  Oh, you mean these?

03:30.643 --> 03:33.213
You must have left them
in my locker by mistake.

03:33.246 --> 03:36.549
 But why would...
 Oh, never mind.
 I'm late for practice.

03:38.084 --> 03:39.185
That's not fair.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.154
  No, but it's smart.

03:41.187 --> 03:43.189
You can deliver my radio
tomorrow morning.

03:46.526 --> 03:48.628
  You know, I really find him
  lacking as a person.

03:50.597 --> 03:53.700
 ...and so my friends,
 I'm pulling
 the plug on my radio.

03:53.733 --> 03:55.235
   I have to go
   into hiding again.

03:55.268 --> 03:58.838
Now this is Elvis Presley
signing off. <i>"Don't be cruel."</i>

04:00.774 --> 04:02.042
   Okay, Screech! Disconnect!

04:02.075 --> 04:03.443
 Screech: Okay!

04:03.476 --> 04:04.811
  ( thunder rumbling )

04:04.844 --> 04:06.780
 Hurry up! It sounds like
 it's going to pour out there!

04:06.813 --> 04:08.581
  ( thunder crashing )
  I'll be done in a...

04:08.615 --> 04:10.450
  Screech: ( screams )
  Ahhh!

04:11.518 --> 04:13.086
 Screech!
 Are you okay?

04:14.287 --> 04:16.089
  Screech! Answer me!

04:19.659 --> 04:20.959
Screech!

04:25.065 --> 04:27.067
 Screech!
 Are you alive?

04:28.968 --> 04:30.670
( blandly )
What's for dinner, Mom?

04:35.642 --> 04:39.579
   Look, you better sit down.
   I think you were
   hit by lightning.

04:39.612 --> 04:42.148
  Fish would be fine.
  Can we have
  pudding for dessert?

04:45.352 --> 04:46.853
  Where are you going,
  Screech?

04:46.886 --> 04:49.089
   Home to study
   for Testaverde's midterm.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.091
   Answer the phone.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.292
  Screech, the phone's not...

04:52.325 --> 04:54.127
  ( telephone rings )

04:54.160 --> 04:55.929
( door closes )

04:57.364 --> 04:58.732
  So how do you feel?

04:58.765 --> 05:00.900
 Oh, better than usual.

05:00.934 --> 05:03.703
   Zack, I think we better
   get out of here right now.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.776
Sorry, kid. It slipped.
Are you okay?

05:09.809 --> 05:13.847
  Yeah, I'm all right.
  Thanks to him.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.949
 Hey, Screech. How'd you know
 that light was going to fall?

05:16.049 --> 05:17.183
 I'm not sure.

05:17.217 --> 05:19.252
  Ever since that
  lighting hit me last night,

05:19.285 --> 05:21.755
   I've been getting
   these pictures in my head.

05:21.788 --> 05:22.956
 What kind of pictures?

05:23.056 --> 05:24.090
   All kinds.

05:24.124 --> 05:25.625
Real clear ones.

05:25.658 --> 05:28.595
   Right now, I'm
   getting...a tennis racket.

05:28.628 --> 05:31.097
   A tennis racket?
   What do you mean,
   a tennis rack...

05:35.335 --> 05:38.705
  Tell me, buddy.
  What other
  pictures do you see?

05:38.738 --> 05:40.674
  I see nerds.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.176
   It's my pocket protector.

05:43.209 --> 05:44.711
 No, it's mine.

05:44.744 --> 05:46.579
You give it back
or I'll tell.

05:47.313 --> 05:50.583
  Give me my pocket protector.

05:50.617 --> 05:53.219
 This is the most
 incredible thing
 that's ever happened!

05:53.253 --> 05:55.755
More incredible
than the <i>"Brady</i>
<i>Bunch"</i> reunion?

05:55.789 --> 05:59.926
 Yes! You've been given a gift,
 the power to see the future.

06:00.026 --> 06:02.062
   I knew you were
   going to say that.

06:02.095 --> 06:04.264
  As your best friend,
  I've got warn you,

06:04.297 --> 06:06.733
  there are people out there
  who'd take advantage of you.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.234
   For your sake,
   I think we should

06:08.268 --> 06:10.036
  keep this gift
  between you and me.

06:10.036 --> 06:11.104
Agreed?

06:11.137 --> 06:12.172
  Thanks for
  protecting me, Zack.

06:15.842 --> 06:17.911
   I've got the geek
   that laid the golden egg.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.048
 I knew you were going
 to say that, too.

06:28.221 --> 06:31.224
 Your American History midterm
 will be Thursday at 10:00 AM.

06:31.257 --> 06:34.294
It will consist of three
essay questions.

06:34.327 --> 06:36.663
I thought we'd spend
this last
session before the exam

06:36.696 --> 06:39.933
 reviewing
 the material from which
 those questions will be drawn.

06:39.966 --> 06:43.770
   As usual, we have
   a lot to cover.

06:43.803 --> 06:45.238
   So if you pay
   careful attention,

06:45.271 --> 06:46.873
you'll have
nothing to worry about.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.075
Everybody ready?

06:50.076 --> 06:51.811
 ( speaking very
 rapidly ) We'll begin

06:51.845 --> 06:53.313
 with British actions
 between 1763 and 1775

06:53.346 --> 06:55.215
 that led to discontent
 among the Colonists,

06:55.248 --> 06:57.217
the first was
the Proclamation of 1763

06:57.250 --> 06:59.085
   forbidding
   settlement in all lands
   west of the Appalachians,

06:59.085 --> 07:00.787
 followed by the Quartering Act
 of 1765 forcing
 Colonists to house

07:00.820 --> 07:02.655
and feed British troops,
followed by
the Stamp Act in 1765

07:02.689 --> 07:03.923
ordering
Colonists to buy stamps
from the British,

07:04.024 --> 07:06.026
 followed by more taxes in 1767
 on glass, paint, paper and tea

07:06.059 --> 07:08.228
  leading to colonists rioting
  throwing snowballs
  at soldiers shouting,

07:08.261 --> 07:09.596
"Lobster!"
"Bloody-back!" "Coward",

07:09.629 --> 07:12.065
 leading to the Boston Massacre
 leaving three
 Colonists lying dead.

07:12.098 --> 07:15.201
 That brings us to 1773
 and the Tea Act

07:15.235 --> 07:16.936
saying only the British
could bring tea
into the Colonies

07:17.037 --> 07:18.371
 and only
 the British East India
 Company could sell it,

07:18.405 --> 07:19.839
  leading to Sons
  of Liberty dressing

07:19.873 --> 07:21.074
   like what used to
   be called Indians

07:21.107 --> 07:22.942
 now known as Native Americans
 stealing aboard a British ship

07:23.043 --> 07:24.277
   and dumping cargo
   into Boston Harbor

07:24.310 --> 07:25.512
in an event that
came to be known

07:25.545 --> 07:27.881
 as the ''Boston Tea Party,''
 without sugar, lemon or cream.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.183
  Americans won
  the Battle of King's

07:30.216 --> 07:31.851
 Mountain and
 the Battle of Cowpens,

07:31.885 --> 07:33.420
  forcing Cornwallis to march
  north to Virginia to be met

07:33.453 --> 07:36.256
 by Patriots in North Carolina.
 He suffered losses and
 retreated to Yorktown,

07:36.289 --> 07:38.124
 leading to Washington's
 fake attack on New York city,

07:38.158 --> 07:39.793
  followed by
  a swift move to block
  Cornwallis' escape by land,

07:39.826 --> 07:41.061
forcing
Cornwallis to surrender

07:41.061 --> 07:42.562
   at Yorktown on
   October 19th 1781

07:42.595 --> 07:43.730
 while the British band played
 <i>''The World</i>
 <i>Turned Upside Down''</i>

07:43.763 --> 07:45.165
   and the American band
   played <i>''Yankee Doodle''!</i>

07:46.132 --> 07:47.434
 Any questions?

07:47.467 --> 07:49.369
( school bell ringing )

07:49.402 --> 07:51.237
   Good luck.
   See you Thursday.

07:58.611 --> 08:00.780
   I cannot run track today.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.515
   I have so much food in me,

08:02.549 --> 08:03.450
 you could put
 a quarter in my mouth

08:03.483 --> 08:05.518
and a bag of Doritos
would come popping out.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.656
   Lisa, you have got to stop
   doing this to yourself.

08:09.689 --> 08:12.359
  That's easy for you to say.
  Nothing bothers you.

08:12.392 --> 08:14.461
   Oh yeah?
   Lots of things bother me.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.396
 I just don't let them
 drive me bananas.

08:16.796 --> 08:19.366
 You have one?

08:19.399 --> 08:22.569
 Lisa, come on.
 If you keep obsessing
 about your grades

08:22.602 --> 08:23.903
 you know what you're
 going to end up like?

08:23.937 --> 08:25.905
  You know, you guys,
  I just remembered,

08:25.939 --> 08:28.308
   there was one time
   that I did not get an "A."

08:28.341 --> 08:29.476
   I was in the fourth grade.

08:29.509 --> 08:31.311
  Mr. Simmons had
  a nervous breakdown

08:31.344 --> 08:33.513
   and gave
   the class "L's" and "Q's."

08:34.647 --> 08:36.582
 Why is getting an "A"
 so important to you?

08:36.616 --> 08:38.650
  It's not important.

08:38.684 --> 08:39.619
All right it is.

08:39.652 --> 08:42.389
I know it shouldn't be
but I can't help myself.

08:42.422 --> 08:43.923
It's my whole identity.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.525
  What are you talking about?

08:45.558 --> 08:47.460
 Will you stop hollering at me?

08:47.494 --> 08:51.731
  Look... Everyone's got to be
  something, right?

08:51.765 --> 08:55.568
   She's the fashionable one.
   You're the popular one.
   Who am I?

08:55.602 --> 08:57.771
 The wacko one.

08:57.804 --> 09:00.240
 You know Kelly, you remind me
 a lot of my cousin Denise.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.709
 She never worried.
 She was always on honor roll.

09:02.742 --> 09:04.878
   Until she had Testaverde.

09:04.911 --> 09:06.446
 What happened to her?

09:06.479 --> 09:08.882
 She flunked history,
 and had to go to summer school

09:08.915 --> 09:10.750
 which was also
 taught by Testaverde.

09:10.784 --> 09:12.385
   She got left back,
   dropped out,

09:12.419 --> 09:14.821
   today she teaches English
   to foreign parrots.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.759
 You see?
 She makes good sense.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.328
You guys might be right.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.464
   I think we should cut gym
   and hit the books.

09:24.497 --> 09:27.634
 This test is gonna be
 no piece of cake.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.302
 Cake?
 Who has cake?

09:31.571 --> 09:34.341
  Okay Screech.
  Slater will be here
  in a minute to pick this up.

09:34.374 --> 09:36.676
   Actually,
   seven and a half seconds.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.511
 Now you remember
 all the signals we rehearsed?

09:38.545 --> 09:39.813
  Okay.
  Yep.

09:39.846 --> 09:42.615
  All right, Morris.
  It's time to pay the piper.

09:42.649 --> 09:44.351
  Hey, I see you got my radio.

09:44.384 --> 09:48.288
 I got it. But what's the rush?
 How about another bet?

09:48.321 --> 09:50.357
You never learn,
do you, sucker?

09:50.390 --> 09:53.426
   What are you
   going to lose now,
   your TV set?

09:53.460 --> 09:57.297
 I don't know. For some reason
 I kind of feel lucky today.

09:57.330 --> 10:01.001
   How about my TV and stereo
   for this radio
   and your jacket?

10:01.034 --> 10:03.703
   You're on, Preppy.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.672
( German man on radio )
This is Hans.
<i>Ver ist you, Elvis?</i>

10:06.573 --> 10:07.874
What'd you say?

10:07.907 --> 10:09.676
 <i>Nein.</i> I mean, nothing.

10:09.709 --> 10:11.778
  So call it. What's the bet?

10:11.811 --> 10:15.315
 Okay, the bet is who's coming
 down those steps next.

10:15.348 --> 10:16.716
   You're on.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.785
I guess a blonde
in tight jeans.

10:18.818 --> 10:20.987
   And I say...a band member.

10:26.826 --> 10:29.829
   Very good, Zack.
   How'd you do that?

10:43.743 --> 10:46.846
  Screech, your mother told me
  about lightning hitting you.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.582
I just want to make sure
you're doing all right.

10:49.616 --> 10:51.017
   8:30 last night.
   Tell me...

10:51.051 --> 10:53.586
 When exactly were you
 struck by lightning?

10:53.620 --> 10:55.021
 Yeah.
 8:30?

10:55.722 --> 10:56.823
One.
Are there any...

10:56.856 --> 10:59.025
...side-effects?
Did you say one?

10:59.059 --> 11:01.061
Yeah, but it's a secret.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.896
   I'm not
   supposed to tell anyone
   that I can see the future.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.464
See the future?

11:04.497 --> 11:05.932
   Preposterous?
   Screech, that's...

11:05.965 --> 11:07.067
 Can she come in?
 Right.

11:07.100 --> 11:09.102
  ( knocking )

11:09.135 --> 11:12.072
Mr. Wilson wants to know
if you can move
your lunch to 1:00.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.640
 He can't, he has
 a dentist appointment.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.608
Make it Tuesday.

11:18.078 --> 11:19.846
Now where was I?

11:19.879 --> 11:21.581
  You were about to say no one
  has the power to
  see the future.

11:21.614 --> 11:24.651
 Right!
 Screech, no one has the power
 to see the future.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.353
Pick what up?
Oops! I'll pick them up.

11:28.655 --> 11:32.092
   Uh, Screech,
   I'm just curious.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.094
  My mother-in-law is staying
  with us indefinitely.

11:34.127 --> 11:36.529
   Now, by any chance
   can you tell me...

11:36.563 --> 11:38.565
   All right!
   She'll be gone by Tuesday.

11:43.003 --> 11:46.973
 Saturday,
 the track opens at noon
 and the first race is at 1:00?

11:47.007 --> 11:49.109
   Okay, thanks. Bye.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.477
 Here put this
 in my gym bag.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.449
 Come on, Screech.
 I can't wait forever.
 Tell me now.

11:56.483 --> 11:57.617
 Tell you what?

11:57.650 --> 12:01.154
The three questions
on Testaverde's midterm.

12:01.187 --> 12:04.724
  Discuss the four steps taken
  by the first
  Continental Congress,

12:04.758 --> 12:07.694
   the three parts
   of the Declaration
   of independence

12:07.727 --> 12:11.865
   and the Battle of Saratoga
   as the turning
   point of the war.

12:11.898 --> 12:15.435
   That's my man!
   Now for the kill!

12:16.736 --> 12:19.739
   Okay, Slater,
   it's the bet of the year.

12:19.773 --> 12:22.542
  The loser has to be
  a slave for a week,

12:22.575 --> 12:25.679
   and do anything
   the winner wants.
   Up to it?

12:25.712 --> 12:27.647
What are we betting on?

12:27.681 --> 12:30.884
 I bet you that
 I'm going to ace
 Testaverde's midterm tomorrow.

12:30.917 --> 12:34.187
 Zack, Testaverde couldn't ace
 Testaverde's midterm.

12:34.220 --> 12:36.189
 We got a bet, Preppie.

12:36.222 --> 12:40.093
 Excuse me,
 but I got to go home
 and start making a slave list.

12:40.126 --> 12:41.528
   You wish, Slater.

12:41.561 --> 12:42.729
Hey, starting tomorrow,

12:42.762 --> 12:45.732
it's going to be
Master Slater.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.500
  Zack, how can you be
  so confident?

12:47.534 --> 12:50.103
  Why not? Testaverde told us
  what to review.

12:50.103 --> 12:51.871
 But he talks so fast.

12:51.905 --> 12:54.007
  Oh really? I didn't notice.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.909
   It's too bad
   you don't want
   to study with me,

12:55.942 --> 12:58.545
   but hey, failing miserably
   is no disgrace.

12:58.578 --> 13:00.146
 Well, maybe
 I've changed my mind.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.082
Okay.
7:30, my house?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.733
 Zack, can you
 turn on another light?

13:19.766 --> 13:21.401
I can hardly see
the book.

13:21.434 --> 13:24.204
  And that music is so mellow,
  it's distracting.

13:24.237 --> 13:27.474
 Hey Kelly, I read that tension
 is the enemy of learning.'

13:27.507 --> 13:28.742
Really?

13:28.775 --> 13:30.210
Sure. Try this.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.145
   Sit back,

13:32.746 --> 13:34.414
close your eyes,

13:35.281 --> 13:37.150
  and relax your body.

13:38.518 --> 13:40.153
   Okay, let's get back to...

13:40.186 --> 13:41.755
   You're not relaxed enough!

13:41.788 --> 13:44.624
   Look, I suggest
   some
   stress-releasing activity.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.559
   Like what?

13:46.593 --> 13:48.328
 Come on.
 ( music volume rises )

13:53.667 --> 13:57.103
   Zack, we're preparing
   for a midterm, not a prom.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.105
 Kelly, relax.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.710
 You think I want to be
 Slater's slave?

14:03.743 --> 14:06.312
We're going to ace
this midterm. Trust me.

14:08.415 --> 14:09.516
 Okay.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.419
 Are you sure?

14:12.452 --> 14:14.387
  Jessie:
  That's what I want to know.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.256
  What are you
  doing here?

14:16.289 --> 14:18.224
Zack, you said you knew
all the questions.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.193
 I couldn't keep it
 from my best friends.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.162
( music stops )

14:22.195 --> 14:24.130
Zack!
You're an angel.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.466
I've lost two pounds
since I heard the news.

14:29.102 --> 14:32.072
Where's the lightning
when you really need it?

14:32.105 --> 14:35.141
  Zack, how can you be so sure
  what's on
  Testaverde's midterm?

14:35.175 --> 14:38.478
  Hey, come on.
  I can just...see it.

14:38.511 --> 14:40.680
 Like Richard Dreyfuss
 in "Close Encounters".

14:40.714 --> 14:42.716
  Oh,
  you mean some weird-looking
  creature told you?

14:43.450 --> 14:44.684
Kind of.

14:46.686 --> 14:48.488
  You do believe him,
  don't you, Jessie?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.157
  Maybe I do.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.526
 Because I know Zack,
 and he wouldn't lie to Kelly.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.328
No, I wouldn't.
Would you, Zack?

14:55.362 --> 14:57.430
   Because if Kelly found out
   this was an excuse

14:57.464 --> 15:00.467
   to get her alone with you,
   she'd kill you,
   wouldn't you, Kelly?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.068
 Yes, I would!

15:02.102 --> 15:03.636
  Hey, everyone, take it easy.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.206
 Just study
 the First
 Continental Congress,

15:06.239 --> 15:07.774
the Declaration
of independence,

15:07.807 --> 15:09.809
   and the Battle
   of Saratoga, okay?

15:09.843 --> 15:11.111
  What about everything else?

15:11.144 --> 15:12.412
 Don't waste your time.

15:12.445 --> 15:15.782
 Now if you'll leave me alone,
 I have to
 prepare to get my "A."

15:20.620 --> 15:21.755
Zack! We've got to talk.

15:21.788 --> 15:23.256
 Screech, I'm studying.

15:23.289 --> 15:24.724
  That's just it.
  Now I see different

15:24.758 --> 15:26.760
 questions on
 Testaverde's midterm.

15:26.793 --> 15:27.660
   What do you mean?

15:27.694 --> 15:30.163
Now I see the Committees
of Correspondence

15:30.196 --> 15:31.865
   and the Battle of Trenton.

15:31.898 --> 15:34.300
    No wait, it's <i>"The Battle</i>
   <i>of The Network Stars."</i>

15:35.869 --> 15:37.804
 I see Patrick Henry...

15:37.837 --> 15:41.141
No it's Patrick Swayze,

15:41.174 --> 15:44.611
dirty dancing
across the Delaware
with Martha Washington.

15:46.446 --> 15:49.482
   I see Paul Revere
   on a bus...

15:49.516 --> 15:51.851
   Zack,
   did you know that Lincoln
   freed the Japanese?

15:54.354 --> 15:56.156
 I think I've lost it.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.657
  Come on, don't jump
  to conclusions.

15:57.691 --> 15:59.325
 Hey, you knew I was
 going to say that, didn't you?

16:01.327 --> 16:03.129
  All right,
  call it in the air.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.798
 Heads!

16:06.466 --> 16:07.801
   Two out of three.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.669
 Tails!

16:12.138 --> 16:13.873
 I'm history...

16:13.907 --> 16:15.575
Unless I come up
with a plan.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.515
   Zack, we could get
   in real trouble for this.

16:22.549 --> 16:24.217
Screech,
just flush the toilets.

16:27.287 --> 16:29.656
It's ringing.
Ready with the buckets!

16:29.689 --> 16:32.492
   Hello, Mr. Testaverde?
   Well, this is Mr. Belding.

16:32.525 --> 16:35.195
What? What?
You can hardly hear me?

16:35.228 --> 16:37.364
 Well, that's because
 of all the chaos around here.

16:37.397 --> 16:39.899
  The pipes broke this morning
  and we're up to
  our knees in water!

16:39.933 --> 16:41.634
  ( yelling )
  I can't stop the water, Joe!

16:41.668 --> 16:43.937
The water's rising, Tom.
Help!

16:45.839 --> 16:48.508
 Yes, we're postponing
 all midterms

16:48.541 --> 16:50.510
   until we've got this mess
   under control.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.712
  So don't bother
  coming in today, all right?

16:53.546 --> 16:54.581
   All right!

16:54.614 --> 16:56.449
Okay, cut out the noise.

16:56.816 --> 16:57.951
 Whew!

17:01.421 --> 17:03.490
 Zack, are you sure
 this is going to work?

17:03.523 --> 17:06.893
 Screech, in confusion,
 there's victory.

17:06.925 --> 17:11.297
   Now,
   Belding should be entering
   his office just about now.

17:11.330 --> 17:14.901
  He sits down,
  hears the phone ring, and...

17:14.934 --> 17:17.170
( speaking rapidly )
Hello, Mr. Belding?
This is Mr. Testaverde.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.704
 What's wrong with me?
 You can hear
 what's wrong with me.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.740
  Laryngitis, a horrible cough
  and postnasal drip!

17:21.608 --> 17:22.675
  ( banging )

17:24.210 --> 17:26.346
 That was the doorbell.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.614
The delivery boy's here
with my medicine.

17:27.646 --> 17:29.049
I'm too sick to come in.

17:29.049 --> 17:30.884
 If I give you my
 three questions,
 will you administer it for me?

17:30.917 --> 17:33.219
Thanks.
Here's the questions...

17:35.422 --> 17:37.824
  Thanks for helping me, Zack.
  I feel so good
  about this test.

17:37.857 --> 17:40.860
Me too. I hope.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.730
 Zack, if you're wrong,
 I'm going to need
 a jumbo barf bag.

17:46.066 --> 17:49.269
A list of slave chores,
Morris.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.770
   And that's just
   for the first day.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.440
 Housebreak
 your Doberman?

17:55.542 --> 17:56.843
 If I don't get an "A"
 on this test,

17:56.876 --> 17:59.079
  I will train my dog to think
  you're a tree, okay?

17:59.913 --> 18:01.748
 ( school bell rings )

18:04.250 --> 18:05.752
Morning, class.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.354
 What's he doing here?

18:07.387 --> 18:10.023
I have no idea.

18:10.023 --> 18:13.593
   Mr. Testaverde's ill,
   so I'm going
   to administer his midterm.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.262
   Now the exam consists
   of three essay questions.

18:16.296 --> 18:18.932
 I'll read them aloud,
 so listen
 carefully and copy them down.

18:20.033 --> 18:22.335
 Number one.
 Discuss the four steps

18:22.369 --> 18:24.504
   taken by
   the Continental Congress.

18:25.705 --> 18:27.807
Number two.
Discuss the three parts

18:27.841 --> 18:31.244
   of the Declaration
   of Independence.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.513
   Number three.
   Discuss the Battle

18:33.546 --> 18:36.383
 of Saratoga as
 the turning point in the war.

18:36.416 --> 18:37.784
  Good luck, everyone.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.285
 You're terrific, Zack.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.553
  Hey, I was right all along.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.528
Richard!

18:48.561 --> 18:50.630
Belding: George,
what are you doing here?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.532
  My loyalty to
  school wouldn't let me
  stay home in time of crisis.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.768
 Besides, plumbing's my hobby.
 Where's the flood?

18:54.801 --> 18:57.771
 What flood? And what happened
 to your laryngitis?

18:57.804 --> 19:00.006
Laryngitis?
I don't have laryngitis.

19:00.040 --> 19:01.307
 What's going on here?

19:01.341 --> 19:03.510
Well, I'm giving
your midterm.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.478
  Those are not the questions
  to my midterm.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.013
These are the questions
you called me with.

19:07.047 --> 19:09.015
 George, you called me.
 You called me!

19:09.049 --> 19:10.483
 Richard you called me.

19:10.517 --> 19:11.785
   No, George. You called me.

19:11.818 --> 19:15.021
 Wait a minute,
 you called me George.

19:15.789 --> 19:18.425
You always
call me George.

19:18.458 --> 19:22.028
   The person who phoned me
   called me Mr. Testaverde.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.698
  And the person who phoned me
  called me Mr. Belding.'

19:25.665 --> 19:27.300
But what kind of
devious creature

19:27.334 --> 19:29.369
   would make two
   fake phone calls?

19:29.402 --> 19:30.937
   ( phone ringing )

19:40.714 --> 19:42.682
  Zack can't come to the phone
  right now.

19:42.716 --> 19:45.518
   He's on the way to pick up
   his season
   tickets to detention.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.054
   If you'd like to
   leave a message,
   please wait for the beep.

19:49.756 --> 19:50.890
 Beep.

19:52.592 --> 19:56.062
 Now...for the real questions.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.198
   Number on.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.866
( rapidly )List and
discuss the intolerable
Acts of 1774.

19:59.899 --> 20:01.067
  Number two.
  Describe four steps

20:01.101 --> 20:02.702
 taken by the Second
 Continental Congress.

20:02.736 --> 20:04.004
 Number three.
 Discuss two strengths
 and three weaknesses

20:04.037 --> 20:05.739
   of the Articles
   of Confederation.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.142
 Hey all right!
 He posted the grades.

20:09.175 --> 20:10.944
  C-.

20:10.977 --> 20:13.146
   Not bad. Congratulations.

20:13.179 --> 20:15.081
I am a forgiving
person, Zack.

20:15.115 --> 20:18.051
   But this is going to take
   a very long time.

20:21.588 --> 20:24.858
 A "D plus"?
 I'm going to be sick.

20:24.891 --> 20:27.794
   Lisa,
   what is that funny looking
   letter next to my name?

20:29.796 --> 20:31.998
   It's a Q, Jessie.

20:32.032 --> 20:35.835
  No, really. I can take it.
  Whatever I got, I deserved.

20:35.869 --> 20:38.505
 For the first time in my life
 I took the easy way out.

20:38.538 --> 20:40.206
  I'm prepared to face
  the consequences.

20:40.940 --> 20:42.442
   It's a B, Jessie.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.946
 Oh, gosh, we better
 take her to the nurse.

20:50.817 --> 20:52.085
   Zack, I got an A!

20:52.118 --> 20:53.987
  Screech, how'd you do that?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.655
  I was seeing so many
  different pictures,

20:55.689 --> 20:58.258
   I just stayed up all night
   and went over everything.

20:58.291 --> 21:01.161
Oh, you cheated,
you studied.

21:02.829 --> 21:04.898
And now we come
to Zack Morris.

21:06.132 --> 21:09.903
   F-, for scamming.

21:09.936 --> 21:13.973
Well, Zack, I'd say
you lost the bet there,
"Slave."

21:14.074 --> 21:16.443
  You can give me back
  my jacket,

21:16.476 --> 21:19.813
  and you can use
  your cellular phone
  to order me a pizza,

21:19.846 --> 21:23.516
   and then start get to work
   on this list.

21:31.524 --> 21:34.594
 Yes, hello. I'd like to order
 a large pizza

21:34.627 --> 21:37.664
  with mushrooms, anchovies...

21:37.697 --> 21:39.733
And the hottest peppers
you can find.

21:41.568 --> 21:43.636
  ( instrumental
  theme music plays )
