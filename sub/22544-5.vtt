'Like, why are we
in a creepy place already?'

02:04.625 --> 02:07.695
Our vacations usually start out
normal and end up creepy.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.998
We're only passing through
this Transylvanian village

02:11.064 --> 02:13.100
on our way
to an awesome old castle.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.303
Call it what you like,
but "old castle"

02:15.369 --> 02:16.904
still rings creepy to me.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.407
Relax, Shaggy,
The Hex Girls are shooting

02:19.473 --> 02:21.074
their new music video there

02:21.141 --> 02:22.876
and I'm hoping
they make me an extra.

02:22.943 --> 02:24.945
Uh, maybe you shouldn't
push it, Daphne.

02:25.012 --> 02:27.014
It was nice enough
that they invited us here

02:27.080 --> 02:28.282
to watch the shoot.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.119
Yeah, Fred,
remind me to thank 'em.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.262
Like, if we turn back now
we can still hit

02:41.329 --> 02:42.996
Strudel Fest in Bavaria.

02:43.063 --> 02:45.733
Ooh, Strudel! Yummy!

02:45.799 --> 02:46.934
Slurp

02:47.000 --> 02:48.336
creak

02:49.403 --> 02:51.405
But the castle is just up ahead.

02:51.472 --> 02:53.941
And between here and there
is that rickety old bridge

02:54.007 --> 02:55.876
saying, "Don't cross me, man!"

02:55.943 --> 02:57.311
You know what I say to that?

02:57.378 --> 02:59.146
"Eat my tire tread, bridge!"

03:03.384 --> 03:05.453
- Aah!
- Aah!

03:10.524 --> 03:12.260
Can I drive or what?

03:17.465 --> 03:18.666
Are you insane?

03:18.732 --> 03:20.234
You want to keep shooting
this video

03:20.301 --> 03:22.236
with that vampire freak
on the loose?

03:22.303 --> 03:23.504
I barely got away from him.

03:23.571 --> 03:24.681
We're gonna shoot this video

03:24.705 --> 03:26.139
with or without you!

03:26.206 --> 03:27.441
Go right ahead!

03:27.508 --> 03:29.877
I wonder what's going on
with The Hex Girls.

03:29.943 --> 03:33.481
Oh, Dusk's dumping
Thorn and Luna to go solo.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.183
- How do you know that?
- "Popular" magazine.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.627
I never leave the States
without it.

03:37.651 --> 03:39.387
I'm so glad you guys are here.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.889
- We could really use your help.
- No problem.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.857
Where's my wedding dress
and black fingernails?

03:43.924 --> 03:46.394
The shoot's on hold
since this rude vampire dude

03:46.460 --> 03:47.661
decided to crash it.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.897
Okay, between "rude" and "dude"

03:49.963 --> 03:52.733
did anybody else hear "vampire?"

03:52.800 --> 03:55.636
This scary vampire guy
came out of nowhere

03:55.703 --> 03:57.738
chased us all over,
and then disappeared.

03:57.805 --> 04:00.007
So, like,
there's a creepy castle

04:00.073 --> 04:01.709
a vampire on the loose..

04:04.044 --> 04:05.044
Thud

04:05.078 --> 04:06.680
- Aah!
- Aah!

04:06.747 --> 04:09.550
There's no such thing
as a vampire, Shaggy.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.151
But it sounds like
somebody's trying

04:11.218 --> 04:12.252
to scare you out of here.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.721
Why would someone do that?

04:13.787 --> 04:15.356
That's what
we're gonna find out.

04:15.423 --> 04:17.691
And I know exactly
what we need to do.

04:17.758 --> 04:18.758
Split up?

04:18.792 --> 04:21.161
- No. Set a trap.
- What?

04:21.228 --> 04:24.264
But you always want us to
split up before you set a trap.

04:24.332 --> 04:26.266
Really? I never noticed that.

04:29.570 --> 04:31.004
Okay, here's the plan.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.474
The vampire will stumble
into this stack of barrels

04:33.541 --> 04:35.108
and roll in here.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.677
The axe will cut this cord

04:36.744 --> 04:38.379
'and the drape will
land on his head.'

04:38.446 --> 04:40.581
That's when we tie up his feet
and unmask him.

04:40.648 --> 04:42.683
Foolproof!

04:42.750 --> 04:45.453
Now, we just need
to set the live bait.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.187
Like, not us, man.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.922
Sounds too fishy to me.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.458
No, not you two.

04:50.524 --> 04:53.160
Since the vampire went after
The Hex Girls before...

04:53.226 --> 04:54.695
But those girls are too scared.

04:54.762 --> 04:56.564
We can't put them at risk again.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.699
Yeah, you're right, Velma,
we just need someone

04:58.766 --> 05:00.901
to look like one of them.

05:03.537 --> 05:06.440
My mother would have
a heart attack.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.676
Why does she get
to wear the dress?

05:08.742 --> 05:11.011
Because Shaggy
doesn't have the hips for it.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.348
- Uh..
- Okay, Velma, start singing.

05:14.415 --> 05:15.749
Uh..

05:15.816 --> 05:17.785
♪ Almost wed but I fled
almost wed but I fled ♪

05:17.851 --> 05:19.319
♪ Almost wed but I fled ♪

05:19.387 --> 05:21.655
♪ Yeah yeah ♪♪

05:33.667 --> 05:34.667
Thud

05:35.235 --> 05:36.404
creak

05:39.507 --> 05:41.609
Your trap actually worked?

05:41.675 --> 05:44.712
Well, what part of "foolproof"
didn't you understand?

05:46.179 --> 05:49.417
Like, I don't think now is
the time for a makeover, Daph.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.419
There's always time
for a makeover

05:51.485 --> 05:54.422
especially, when
it's also an unmasking.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.725
- Who is that?
- Who is that?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.993
Now, why would a cutie like you

06:00.060 --> 06:01.695
want to ruin our video?

06:01.762 --> 06:04.865
Frustrated singer,
actor, trick-or-treater?

06:04.932 --> 06:07.000
I don't have
to tell you anything!

06:07.067 --> 06:10.504
Then allow me
to fill in the blanks.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.339
I am Owen Decassle

06:12.406 --> 06:14.608
and this is Steve Fortescu.

06:14.675 --> 06:16.944
I bought this place
from Steven's parents

06:17.010 --> 06:21.449
distant descendants of reputed
vampire Baron Fortescu.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.984
You mean you stole
my family's pride

06:24.051 --> 06:25.252
stomped on our souls

06:25.318 --> 06:27.187
and now you're profiting
off my legacy!

06:27.254 --> 06:31.792
As you can see,
the boy has some... issues.

06:31.859 --> 06:34.562
Now, I will leave my castle
to take him to the village

06:34.628 --> 06:36.930
where the authorities
can deal with him.

06:38.466 --> 06:41.101
Uh, Mr. Decassle,
we just came that way.

06:41.168 --> 06:43.871
Sorry, but the bridge is out
and the roads are all flooded.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.405
Then we're stuck here all night

06:45.473 --> 06:47.174
with that freaky Fortescu kid?

06:47.240 --> 06:51.178
I know a very safe place
to keep him out of trouble.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.821
This is a safe place?

07:00.888 --> 07:03.290
Ha ha, like, I'm feeling
a lot of things right now

07:03.356 --> 07:05.258
and safe is not one of 'em!

07:10.230 --> 07:12.933
You can lock me up,
but that won't make a difference

07:13.000 --> 07:14.134
old man!

07:14.201 --> 07:16.036
Your problems won't end with me.

07:16.103 --> 07:21.108
You want the real vampire.
Ha ha ha!

07:21.174 --> 07:22.676
I don't want the real vampire.

07:22.743 --> 07:24.612
I want to go back upstairs!

07:24.678 --> 07:26.413
And you will.

07:26.480 --> 07:30.383
As soon as I take care
of one more thing.

07:32.319 --> 07:34.688
Eh! You tugged, master?

07:36.524 --> 07:38.058
- Yikes!
- Yikes!

07:38.125 --> 07:40.961
Wretchfield, why don't you
show these nice people

07:41.028 --> 07:45.432
to their rooms? And make sure
they are all... comfortable.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.434
Yow!

07:47.501 --> 07:49.336
Get off of me, man!

07:49.402 --> 07:51.672
Bad beetle!
My apologies.

07:51.739 --> 07:54.708
Max must have wriggled out
of his leash.

08:01.849 --> 08:04.117
Uh, Mr. Wretchfield sir

08:04.184 --> 08:07.220
if you don't mind me asking,
how long have you worked here?

08:07.287 --> 08:09.923
I've given my life
to this castle.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.792
It used to be a serene place

08:11.859 --> 08:14.595
filled with glorious
chamber music.

08:14.662 --> 08:17.397
None of this ear-bleeding,
garbled garbage

08:17.464 --> 08:20.033
that they dare call music!

08:21.401 --> 08:23.170
Think I hit a sore spot.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.173
Thud thud

08:29.342 --> 08:31.712
Hmm, not a hideous space

08:31.779 --> 08:34.548
but positively void
of personality.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.421
Uh, that doesn't look
like a mint on my pillow.

08:41.488 --> 08:44.625
Like, I think those beds
are already taken, Scoob.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.795
- Ooh!
- It's okay.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.797
So, it may not be a fancy hotel

08:49.863 --> 08:53.033
with bug-free beds
and tiny soaps. Heh heh heh.

08:53.100 --> 08:56.069
But at least we're safe
from that creepy vampire.

09:06.947 --> 09:08.081
Huh?

09:09.683 --> 09:11.619
Whoosh

09:12.953 --> 09:13.953
Uh, uh!

09:19.660 --> 09:21.695
That sounds like Daphne!

09:22.930 --> 09:24.698
A-a-ah!

09:24.765 --> 09:26.734
Uh, sorry, Mr. Vampire.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.672
- 'Where'd it go?'
- Hey, what's going on in here?

09:31.739 --> 09:34.274
Your vampire crasher
made an unscheduled

09:34.341 --> 09:35.943
guest appearance in my room.

09:36.009 --> 09:39.179
Daphne, were you able to get
a good look at the vampire?

09:39.246 --> 09:40.313
You bet I did.

09:40.380 --> 09:43.283
There's no doubt
it was Steve Fortescu.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.484
But that's impossible.

09:44.551 --> 09:46.687
He's locked up in the dungeon.

09:50.658 --> 09:52.059
Now, wait a minute.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.094
Steve's still sitting
right in that cell

09:54.161 --> 09:55.228
where we left him?

09:55.295 --> 09:56.396
I don't get it.

09:56.463 --> 09:57.798
Huh?

10:01.301 --> 10:02.535
Maybe, Scoob.

10:02.602 --> 10:06.239
Maybe when Mr. Decassle
bent down to tie his shoe

10:06.306 --> 10:07.741
Steve turned into a bat

10:07.808 --> 10:10.010
and flew out between the bars.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.981
Scratch that.
Mr. Decassle's wearing slippers.

10:14.047 --> 10:16.283
Just because Steve's
in that jail cell now

10:16.349 --> 10:18.852
doesn't mean he wasn't able
to get out earlier.

10:18.919 --> 10:21.054
So, you agree
with our bat theory?

10:21.121 --> 10:23.824
No. I think somebody's
been letting Steve out.

10:23.891 --> 10:25.158
- Velma's right.
- Mm-hmm.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.894
Somebody must be working
with Steve.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.696
That's the only way
he could supposedly

10:28.762 --> 10:30.230
be in two places at once.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.099
Now, let's split up
and look for clues.

10:32.165 --> 10:34.334
I knew that would come up
sooner or later.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.303
Whoa, Scoob!

10:36.369 --> 10:39.439
Looks like we wandered
into the castle's kitchen.

10:39.506 --> 10:40.841
How do you think that happened?

10:40.908 --> 10:42.309
I don't know.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.844
Maybe the vampire's hiding

10:43.911 --> 10:45.746
in the refrigerator.

10:45.813 --> 10:47.514
Bingo! Ha ha ha.

10:47.580 --> 10:50.083
No vampire and a full fridge.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.553
But what if the vampire
shows up for a quick bite?

10:53.620 --> 10:55.622
Garlic?

10:55.689 --> 10:57.858
But vampires hate garlics..

10:57.925 --> 11:00.694
Oh-h-h. Brilliant idea! Ha ha.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.063
What are we waitin' for?
Let's get cookin'.

11:05.465 --> 11:08.301
I'm almost done with the garlic
banana-berry shake, Scoob.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.038
How about those peanut butter
and garlic cookies?

11:15.442 --> 11:18.946
- Huh!
- Huh? Oh!

11:19.012 --> 11:22.549
What are you two doing here
in my domestic domain?

11:22.615 --> 11:24.217
Uh, leaving?

11:24.284 --> 11:27.520
You know, if cobwebs
and dust balls were clues

11:27.587 --> 11:29.923
we'd have this case
solved by now.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.594
Those screams
came from inside this room.

11:34.661 --> 11:35.796
Stand back, ladies!

11:35.863 --> 11:38.331
But, Fred, it might be unlocked.

11:38.398 --> 11:41.368
Well, what fun is that?

11:41.434 --> 11:42.970
Fred, Velma, Daphne

11:43.036 --> 11:44.571
something's happened to Dusk.

11:44.637 --> 11:46.406
There was this bizarre
flash of light

11:46.473 --> 11:47.707
she disappeared

11:47.775 --> 11:50.377
and then this bat showed up.

11:50.443 --> 11:52.212
I know Dusk
wanted out of the band

11:52.279 --> 11:54.114
but pretending
she turned into a bat?

11:54.181 --> 11:56.183
'That's a little extreme.'

11:56.249 --> 11:57.384
rumble

11:58.786 --> 12:00.553
Daphne, Velma, look over here.

12:00.620 --> 12:02.522
Those stairs probably
lead up to the attic.

12:02.589 --> 12:06.193
And, typically, attics are
great places to find clues.

12:06.259 --> 12:10.097
Unfortunately, nothing's been
typical about this case so far.

12:11.965 --> 12:16.169
Wow, my purse is more organized
than this place.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.236
Aah!

12:17.270 --> 12:19.139
- Uh!
- Uh-h!

12:19.206 --> 12:23.010
Yuck! Probably more
of Wretchfield's long-lost pets.

12:24.311 --> 12:27.047
Check this out.
A birth certificate.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.949
But the name is smudged.

12:29.016 --> 12:31.484
It looks like Stu Fortescu.

12:31.551 --> 12:35.288
That's weird. I wonder
why Steve changed his name.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.724
Maybe Steve has even more issues
than we thought.

12:38.826 --> 12:39.836
Either somebody didn't like

12:39.860 --> 12:41.394
that remark about Steve

12:41.461 --> 12:43.163
or someone's in trouble.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.699
Cut. Cut. Cut!

12:46.766 --> 12:48.869
What is going on here?

12:48.936 --> 12:50.370
'Sorry, Mr. Hakimoto.'

12:50.437 --> 12:52.672
We thought The Hex Girls
were being tormented

12:52.739 --> 12:54.241
by the vampire again.

12:54.307 --> 12:55.575
Oh, I wish.

12:55.642 --> 12:58.912
If he does show up,
I'm going to capture him on film

12:58.979 --> 13:00.747
'and I'll be rich and famous!'

13:00.814 --> 13:05.953
After that, J.J. Hakimoto
presents anything he wants.

13:06.019 --> 13:08.455
Correct me if I'm wrong,
but I don't think

13:08.521 --> 13:11.624
tempting a vindictive vampire
is a wise career move.

13:11.691 --> 13:14.761
Just when you think it's safe
to go back into the castle

13:14.828 --> 13:17.664
J.J. Hakimoto presents..

13:17.730 --> 13:19.099
"Forever Fangs."

13:19.166 --> 13:23.003
'In a castle,
no one can hear you scream.'

13:25.638 --> 13:27.507
Ooh! I've got chills.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.442
Can't you just see it?

13:29.509 --> 13:31.511
Oh, I can see it.

13:38.185 --> 13:40.220

14:19.359 --> 14:21.694
- Looks like we lost him.
- For now.

14:21.761 --> 14:24.631
Like, at least, we're a lot
safer out here in this..

14:24.697 --> 14:25.765
G-g-graveyard?

14:25.832 --> 14:27.000
There's no need to worry.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.468
We left the vampire
in the castle.

14:28.535 --> 14:31.404
'We're completely safe
out here.'

14:38.145 --> 14:40.380
What happened to Fred?

14:41.915 --> 14:43.550
- Fred?
- Fred?

14:50.090 --> 14:51.992
Freddy Jones, hoo-hoo hoo-hoo

14:52.059 --> 14:53.760
where are you?

14:53.826 --> 14:55.963
Fred's not around here anywhere.

14:57.530 --> 14:58.431
Like, Scoob is right.

14:58.498 --> 15:00.167
Didn't you see
the vicious vampire?

15:00.233 --> 15:03.270
He turned Fred into a bat
and there he is.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.572
I really don't think
that bat is Fred

15:05.638 --> 15:09.509
but I do think it's time to put
an end to these vampire hijinks.

15:09.576 --> 15:10.910
And how do we do that?

15:10.978 --> 15:13.580
By doing some research
back inside the castle.

15:13.646 --> 15:16.349
Don't worry, Fred. We won't
let you out of our sight.

15:16.416 --> 15:18.551
Like, you'll be back
to your human self in a...

15:22.222 --> 15:25.725
'Wait. Wait! I didn't mean
I don't like your bat self.'

15:25.792 --> 15:27.527
'You're fine as a bat.'

15:28.261 --> 15:29.562
Hmm.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.398
'It says here
that it's legendary'

15:31.464 --> 15:33.833
'for a vampire to come out
of his coffin once a year'

15:33.900 --> 15:36.469
in search of his
long-lost bride.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.971
How romantic..

15:38.038 --> 15:40.107
In a sick, vampiry kind of way.

15:40.173 --> 15:41.374
Look at this.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.875
'An old photo of Steve standing'

15:42.942 --> 15:44.677
in front of a mirror?

15:44.744 --> 15:46.646
Oh... I get it.

15:46.713 --> 15:48.148
Steve can't be the vampire

15:48.215 --> 15:50.217
because he's casting
a reflection.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.819
I may not know everything
about vampires

15:52.885 --> 15:54.887
but I know a lot about mirrors.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.256
It explains more than that.

15:56.323 --> 15:59.126
In fact, I think
I've got this mystery

15:59.192 --> 16:01.028
just about wrapped up.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.796
Now, all we need to do
is catch that vampire.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.698
I sure wish Fred were here.

16:05.765 --> 16:09.069
You know, I think a woman
is better suited for this job.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.871
'Okay, now'

16:11.938 --> 16:14.141
don't move a wink.

16:16.676 --> 16:20.280
'Oh, no! Fred got mixed up
with a rogue gang of bats!'

16:20.347 --> 16:23.150
Like, we've gotta figure out
which one he is.

16:23.216 --> 16:24.617
'You think this is Fred?'

16:27.320 --> 16:29.689
You're right, this bat
does have muscular wings

16:29.756 --> 16:33.093
but this other one looks like
he's formulating a plan.

16:33.726 --> 16:34.894
Huh?

16:34.961 --> 16:37.164
That friendly guy's
gotta be him.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.600
Like, Fred-bat, wait for us!

16:44.637 --> 16:46.039
Where is he already?

16:46.106 --> 16:48.007
I'm perfect
vampire-bride material.

16:48.075 --> 16:49.609
Yes, you are.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.080
Now, I'm sure the vampire
will show up any minute.

16:53.146 --> 16:56.783
Velma, do you think we're doing
all this to trap a real vampire?

16:56.849 --> 16:58.551
No, of course not.

16:58.618 --> 17:01.288
Then why do you have a whole box
of garlic behind you?

17:01.354 --> 17:03.156
It never hurts
to have a backup plan.

17:04.457 --> 17:05.392
It's him.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.694
Now, get out there
and strut your stuff.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.664
- Aah!
- Unh!

17:11.731 --> 17:13.933
Hiya, Daph!

17:14.000 --> 17:16.035
And, like, see ya, Daph!

17:17.504 --> 17:19.572
Oh! Uh!

17:19.639 --> 17:21.408
Uh. Uh!

17:23.943 --> 17:26.746
The net! Velma, the net!

17:26.813 --> 17:28.481
Thud

17:34.821 --> 17:36.689
Freddy?

17:36.756 --> 17:38.391
Hang in there, fang boy!

17:38.458 --> 17:40.627
Thanks, Fred.
You saved my life.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.096
Actually, I was just
climbing down from the attic

17:43.163 --> 17:45.765
where I was trapped,
but you're welcome anyway.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.535
Uh, what happened?
Where's the vampire?

17:48.601 --> 17:49.436
Did he get away?

17:49.502 --> 17:51.604
Nope.
He's right over there.

17:51.671 --> 17:53.673
Oh, no, he's gone!

17:54.841 --> 17:56.075
Well, guess it looks like

17:56.143 --> 17:58.278
I won't be needing
these anymore.

17:59.979 --> 18:01.148
Thud

18:02.515 --> 18:06.853
Wow, I guess garlic really
does work on vampires.

18:06.919 --> 18:09.189
Yeah, that's the creep
who had me locked up too.

18:09.256 --> 18:10.557
'Be careful, Daphne.'

18:10.623 --> 18:13.560
Don't worry,
it's hypoallergenic.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.462
'Steve Fortescu?'

18:15.528 --> 18:18.531
Okay, so we've proven
Steve is the vampire.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.667
But we don't have a clue
who's been helping him

18:20.733 --> 18:22.068
escape from his cell.

18:22.135 --> 18:23.903
That's not exactly true.

18:23.970 --> 18:25.372
It's no makeup effect.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.874
'Steve and the vampire
look identical'

18:27.940 --> 18:29.542
'because they're twin brothers.'

18:29.609 --> 18:30.510
Of course!

18:30.577 --> 18:32.545
How else could anyone
be in two places

18:32.612 --> 18:36.416
at one time,
unless they look exactly alike?

18:36.483 --> 18:39.186
I bet that birth certificate
with the name Stu

18:39.252 --> 18:41.621
really belongs
to Steve's brother here.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.623
And this photo of Steve
looking in the mirror

18:43.690 --> 18:47.160
was really just the two brothers
standing face-to-face.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.995
Okay, but that still
doesn't explain

18:49.061 --> 18:50.697
why they wanted to trash
our video shoot.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.032
I think they wanted to scare
everybody off

18:53.099 --> 18:54.867
and ruin Owen's business.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.269
And it would have worked

18:56.336 --> 18:58.305
if it weren't
for you meddling kids!

18:58.371 --> 18:59.506
Hi, everybody.

18:59.572 --> 19:00.573
You'll be happy to know

19:00.640 --> 19:02.709
we finally caught Fred-bat.

19:02.775 --> 19:04.744
Oh, hello, Fred.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.046
Hold it, if you're Fred

19:07.113 --> 19:08.815
then who's this on my shoulder?

19:08.881 --> 19:10.016
