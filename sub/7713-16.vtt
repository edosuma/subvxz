Good morning.
Can l help you?

00:05.005 --> 00:08.591
Yes. l'm from
Tech Star, about
a new phone system for you.

l was wondering
if l could talk
to Michael Scott?

l'm sorry.
He's not in right now.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.684
SALESMAN: Really?
He's never around
when l come by.

00:17.768 --> 00:18.768
Shoot.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.687
They have new
phone systems now

00:20.771 --> 00:22.980
that can ring
directly to a salesman,

00:23.065 --> 00:25.441
or someone presses star
and they go to accounting.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.902
Basically, 95% of my job.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.656
But l'd like to see
a machine that puts out
candy for everyone.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.159
Vending machine.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.453
How about l make
an appointment
to come back?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.956
That way l know
he'll be here.

00:40.499 --> 00:41.916
That is a great idea.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.084
Great.

There he is.

Nice to meet you.

00:56.265 --> 00:57.640
Great. Look at that.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.434
l can assure you
we don't need
a new system, though.

00:59.518 --> 01:00.560
We're happy with ours.

to somebody else.

lt's been four months

02:18.305 --> 02:20.515

hotter than Stacy.

lt's so sexy it
becomes hostile.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.379
they had a duel over me.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.547
Yeah, Dwight and Andy.
We were here.

10:31.631 --> 10:32.631
No.

10:32.716 --> 10:37.469
This was years ago
when l was living in Ohio.
John Mark and John David.

10:37.554 --> 10:42.933
Angela, you had
two sets of different men
actually duel over you?

10:43.768 --> 10:46.395
l guess l have.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.148
All right, who's next?
Where's Andy?

10:49.232 --> 10:51.608
He's on one of
his honeymoons.

10:51.693 --> 10:52.735
What?

10:52.819 --> 10:55.988
He made nonrefundable deposits
on his honeymoons,

10:56.072 --> 10:58.490
so he's just knocking
them off one at a time.

10:58.575 --> 10:59.992
l think today he's
hot-air ballooning,

11:00.076 --> 11:03.287
and later he's got
a couples' massage.

11:03.747 --> 11:06.415
My worst breakup
was with Stacy.

11:06.499 --> 11:09.585
lt was a Sunday morning.
We were reading the paper

11:09.961 --> 11:16.216
and l said, "Oh, my God,
l think the Eagles could
clinch the NFC East."

11:16.843 --> 11:20.304
And she said that we're done.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.892
You know what, guys, l don't
think we need to do this.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.019
You're right.
Okay, everyone,
back to work.

11:27.103 --> 11:30.689
No, no, no, no.
l mean have
this kind of party.

11:30.774 --> 11:33.025
l look around and
l see all these
beautiful people

11:33.109 --> 11:34.526
who are alone on Valentine's

11:34.611 --> 11:38.280
and l think that there
are other single people
out there, too.

11:38.365 --> 11:39.615
We just need to find them.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.283
There's a girl out
there for all of us.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.702
Maybe even in
this office park.

11:43.787 --> 11:46.246
There has to be
a way to get all these
lonely people together.

11:46.331 --> 11:47.539
A net? A giant net?

11:47.624 --> 11:49.375
No, not a giant net.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.459
What do you have in mind?

11:50.543 --> 11:52.628
l was thinking
maybe like a mixer.

11:52.712 --> 11:53.712
Oh, God, that's
a terrible idea.

11:53.797 --> 11:54.755
Old-fashioned
meat market.

11:54.839 --> 11:55.881
No.
l don't think it is.

11:55.965 --> 11:59.134
Lonely people
mixing with one
another, breeding,

11:59.219 --> 12:02.054
creating an even
lonelier generation?

12:02.138 --> 12:04.890
You're not allowing
natural selection
to do its work.

12:04.974 --> 12:07.810
You're like the guy
who invented the seatbelt.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.229
These people need love.

12:10.313 --> 12:13.148
And l am going
to get it for them.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.692
Who cares if we
sell a little bit
less paper today?

12:15.777 --> 12:16.902
A great boss cares more

12:16.986 --> 12:20.948
about the happiness
of his employees
than anything else.

12:21.032 --> 12:22.741
l am going to be Cupid.

12:22.826 --> 12:26.120
And I'm going
to shoot my sparrow
at unsuspecting victims

12:26.204 --> 12:29.957
and they are going to get hit
and say, "l'm in love.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.209
"l was hit by
Cupid's sparrow."

12:32.627 --> 12:35.254
Funny little bird,
but he gets the job done.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.047
Hey.

12:37.132 --> 12:38.882
Hey. No movement.

12:38.967 --> 12:39.925
Still early.

12:40.009 --> 12:41.677
Yeah, it's not that early.

12:42.512 --> 12:43.679
So how are you holding up?

12:43.763 --> 12:45.264
l'm okay.
l feel a little lopsided

12:45.348 --> 12:47.224
because of all the blood
they took out of
my right side.

12:47.308 --> 12:50.018
No, no. l meant
about being single today.

12:50.186 --> 12:51.562
Meh.
Meh !

12:51.646 --> 12:52.646

to your little friend?
Hi. Dwight.

Hello. l'm Michael Scott.
Welcome to our little shindig.

Hi. l'm Lynn.

13:04.534 --> 13:05.868
Lynn, follow me.
Come on in.

13:05.952 --> 13:06.952
Here we go.

13:07.036 --> 13:08.912
For you we have one
of our top people,

13:08.997 --> 13:13.375
Kevin Malone.
Kevin, come out here.
Show your beautiful self.

13:14.836 --> 13:15.794
Hello.

13:15.879 --> 13:16.879
Hi.

13:18.089 --> 13:21.508
So run with the ball.
Run with it, Kev.

13:24.554 --> 13:25.512
Where are you from?

13:25.597 --> 13:26.597
l'm from here.

13:26.681 --> 13:29.475
Yeah, okay.
Well, he only
gets better.

13:29.559 --> 13:31.310
Thank you, Michael.
Okay.

13:31.394 --> 13:34.646
l can untie any knot.
l'm serious.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.398
Name a knot, any knot.
Go ahead.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.317
l believe you.

13:38.401 --> 13:40.402
You shouldn't believe
everything you hear.

13:40.487 --> 13:43.572
ln fact, there are many knots
that l cannot untie.

13:45.074 --> 13:49.828
So what's a woman as
charming as yourself
find herself employed

13:49.913 --> 13:51.622
on a day such as today?

13:51.706 --> 13:53.749
l work at a place
that does catalogs for

13:53.833 --> 13:56.585
community colleges
and small businesses.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.378
You must use a lot of paper.

13:58.463 --> 14:00.255
Oh, God, tons of it.

14:00.798 --> 14:02.049
(SlGHS DELlGHTEDLY)

14:05.803 --> 14:06.887
What's the rule
about eating

14:06.971 --> 14:08.347
when people are
in the bathroom?

14:08.431 --> 14:11.225
l think if you
ordered hot food
you're allowed to eat.

14:11.601 --> 14:12.809
Damn.

14:14.270 --> 14:16.855
They've been in there
for like ten minutes.

14:18.608 --> 14:21.318
Look at that.
Bob ordered hot food.

14:21.736 --> 14:23.111
Yes.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.948
And l think they
gave him too many fries.

14:26.032 --> 14:27.533
We should help him out.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.790
At the Circle Drive-in,
they show old movies.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.792
lt's really cool.

14:37.335 --> 14:38.418
That does sound cool.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.921
l used to go there
with my fiancee.

14:41.965 --> 14:47.302
Before she left me.
l mean, before l left her.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.932
She left me.

14:53.768 --> 14:54.726
Shoot.

14:54.811 --> 14:56.603
l think l blew it.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.815
lt all happened so fast.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.443
So fast.

15:04.279 --> 15:06.572
So, Erik, you
mentioned before

15:06.656 --> 15:08.907
that you are in
tool and die repair.

15:08.992 --> 15:10.033
l am.

15:10.118 --> 15:12.744
Meredith recently had
a total hysterectomy.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.080
So that's sort of a repair.

15:16.916 --> 15:18.709
All right,
l'll let you guys talk.

15:20.128 --> 15:23.046
lt's going very well.
People are mixing.
A lot of hope,

15:23.131 --> 15:26.300
'cause that's
what you hate to see,
when hope gets crushed.

15:28.678 --> 15:31.179
Sorry. Thought l heard
somebody coming in.

discounts we're talking
about are not. . .

15:43.067 --> 15:45.736
Hold on. Michael,
why do you keep looking
at the front door?

15:45.820 --> 15:47.279
No reason.
ls somebody after you?

15:47.363 --> 15:48.322
Why do you always
go to that?

15:48.406 --> 15:50.282
Has anyone ever been after
anyone in this office?

15:50.366 --> 15:51.783
Hey, it just takes one.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.160
Nobody's after me. l just. . .

15:53.244 --> 15:55.120
l met a woman when
l was giving blood

15:55.204 --> 15:56.747
and l thought
she might come by.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.249
You met a woman when
you were giving blood?
That is so romantic.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.877
lt's not a big deal, really.
l just, you know,

16:01.961 --> 16:04.296
met somebody.
We hardly talked.

16:04.380 --> 16:08.550
l picked up her glove
so l was hoping l could
give it back to her.

16:08.635 --> 16:11.219
Oh, my God, that makes it
even more romantic.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.264
This is like
a modern-day Enchanted.
lt's like a fairytale.

16:14.349 --> 16:15.474
She could be
your soul mate.

16:15.558 --> 16:16.683
DWlGHT: Not likely.

16:16.768 --> 16:17.934
With three billion
women on the planet,

16:18.019 --> 16:20.687
most of them live
in Asia, so the numbers
just don't add up.

16:20.772 --> 16:21.813
lt's possible.
Could be.

16:21.898 --> 16:24.483
Believe me, it's nothing.
l hardly even talked to her.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.985

We were lying there
next to each other.

No. Just kidding.

Why don't you cover it
with the broccoli?

16:40.083 --> 16:43.043
Great, l have to cover it?

16:43.127 --> 16:44.670
Do you think they
dined and dashed?

16:44.754 --> 16:48.423
They didn't dine so, yeah,
maybe they just dashed.

16:49.884 --> 16:51.718

having a nice time.

You didn't eat
much there, Jim-bo.

17:47.817 --> 17:48.942
Want some meat?

17:49.026 --> 17:52.404
Sure, a little piece.
No mushroom, though.

I dated a woman named HoIIy,

actuaIIy the first time
that I've even considered

20:04.829 --> 20:07.455
getting back into
that arena again.

You know what?
Sometimes it's not about

20:10.126 --> 20:13.545
whether CindereIIa
gets her sIipper back,

20:13.629 --> 20:18.925
but it's about
the fact that the prince even
picked up the sIipper at aII.

20:20.261 --> 20:22.304
There's a Iot of
princesses out there.

20:23.973 --> 20:27.225

all different sizes

feet and hands,

20:33.983 --> 20:35.650
l think my odds
are pretty good.

a chocolate chip cookie?

been using Band-Aids.
