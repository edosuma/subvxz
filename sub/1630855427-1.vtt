It's a 3D seating chart.

- Built to scale, naturally.
- Wow!

23
00:01:37.166 --> 00:01:39.291
Each action figure
corresponds to the personality

24
00:01:39.375 --> 00:01:41.500
and/or appearance of our guest.

25
00:01:41.583 --> 00:01:43.916
- Babe, this is incredible!
- You like it?

26
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.208
- Yeah, I like it. I love it.
- Mmm.

27
00:01:46.916 --> 00:01:47.916
Aw!

28
00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.500
Ooh!

29
00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:51.333
Who's He-Man?

30
00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:53.750
What do you mean, "Who's He-Man?"

31
00:01:54.333 --> 00:01:55.166
Oh!

32
00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:57.541
Look at his butt cheeks,
then look at mine.

33
00:01:57.625 --> 00:02:00.375
- Tell me it's not the same.
- Mmm-hmm. Yep, I see it now.

34
00:02:00.458 --> 00:02:03.083
All right! So what do we think?
Bride gets final say.

35
00:02:03.166 --> 00:02:05.583
- Those are your parents, right?
- Mmm-hmm.

36
00:02:05.666 --> 00:02:07.750
Do you think we could
add two more to that table?

37
00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:10.500
My parents just emailed
that they're coming.

38
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.791
- Are you kidding? What?
- Yeah.

39
00:02:13.875 --> 00:02:16.750
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Parker.

40
00:02:16.833 --> 00:02:19.500
Yes!
Oh, I get to meet your parents, finally!

41
00:02:19.583 --> 00:02:20.708
Whoo-hoo!

42
00:02:21.916 --> 00:02:23.458
Oh, okay.

43
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:25.708
I'm gonna marry this guy.

44
00:02:25.791 --> 00:02:28.875
Oh, gosh, that is...
Oh, you have to be so psyched.

45
00:02:28.958 --> 00:02:32.500
Are you psyched? You're not psyched.
Are you psyched at all?

46
00:02:32.583 --> 00:02:35.333
- Is there any psyched happening?
- Yeah. Yeah, no, I...

47
00:02:35.416 --> 00:02:37.083
It's... It's totally great. I just...

48
00:02:37.708 --> 00:02:40.041
I've told you. They can be...

49
00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:41.416
They can be a lot.

50
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.500
Okay, have you met my parents?

51
00:02:43.583 --> 00:02:46.000
I only picked Skeletor and Medusa

52
00:02:46.083 --> 00:02:50.000
because they don't make
Stalin and Lizzie Borden dolls.

53
00:02:51.416 --> 00:02:54.434
Yeah, I'd probably regret it one day
if my parents didn't come to my wedding.

54
00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:56.791
Yes, you would.
We're gonna get through this.

'Cause there is nothing He-Man
and the pink Power Ranger

56
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.083
can't handle together.

57
00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:04.250
Unless Hordak shows up at the wedding.

58
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.666
Is that a deep cut He-Man reference?

59
00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:08.833
Yeah-ha!

60
00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:11.833
Oh, I love you.

61
00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:13.916

Does the silverware have nickel?

67
00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:28.416
I don't know, Mom.

68
00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.708
Cheap silverware has nickel.
Nickel-plated, okay?

69
00:03:30.791 --> 00:03:32.500
You're not gonna skimp on the silverware?

70
00:03:32.583 --> 00:03:35.291
I'll make sure we have high-quality,
nickel-free silverware.

00:03:35.375 --> 00:03:36.208
- Okay?
- Good.

72
00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:38.500
But that's not why I called.
I've got good news.

73
00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.875
Parker's parents can come to the wedding.

74
00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:46.833
Hello?

75
00:03:47.708 --> 00:03:49.934
Guys, I know you're there,
I can hear Dad's nose whistle.

76
00:03:49.958 --> 00:03:52.625
I'm sorry, what kinda parents
skip their own daughter's wedding?

77
00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:54.868
They're not skipping it!
That's the thing, they're not!

78
00:03:54.916 --> 00:03:56.000
Oh, please.

79
00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:58.750
I'm sorry, they were living
with the Yanomami tribe in the Amazon.

80
00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:00.473
It's not exactly easy for them to travel.

81
00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:02.500
No wonder Parker became a stripper.

82
00:04:02.583 --> 00:04:05.208
She's not a stripper!
I've told you a million times!

83
00:04:05.291 --> 00:04:08.041
She runs a yoga studio!
A very successful one!

84
00:04:08.125 --> 00:04:09.416
Oh, I didn't know that.

85
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.041
Yes, you knew that!
I invited you to a class.

86
00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:14.083
You expect your mother to get on a pole?

87
00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:17.000
- There's no pole! It's a yoga studio!
- I'll bet business is booming.

88
00:04:17.083 --> 00:04:19.333
It is booming.
Not in the way I think you're inferring.

89
00:04:19.416 --> 00:04:21.000
- I'm just saying.
- Please.

90
00:04:21.083 --> 00:04:24.000
Please, can we just not make it weird?
Just this one time?

91
00:04:24.083 --> 00:04:27.083
- Weird?
- We're not weird! You're weird!

92
00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:29.708
Your father and I
have been talking about it recently.

93
00:04:29.791 --> 00:04:31.833

Let me get this straight.
You haven't met this woman's parents yet?

103
00:04:58.916 --> 00:05:00.166
No. It's not that weird.

104
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.666
They've been off the grid
the whole time we've been together.

105
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.708
That's so fucking weird, man.

106
00:05:04.791 --> 00:05:06.416
Owen, I don't wanna hurt your feelings,

107
00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.666
but when you first told us about Parker,
we thought you were makin' her up.

108
00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.000
That does hurt my feelings.

109
00:05:11.083 --> 00:05:14.625
But it shouldn't hurt your feelings,
because I've never seen you with nobody,

110
00:05:14.708 --> 00:05:18.250
so I'm like, "This can't be a real woman.
Maybe it's a mannequin or a sex doll."

111
00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:20.208
But guess what? She was real.

112
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:22.291
When I saw her,
I was like, "Girl, you alive!"

113
00:05:22.375 --> 00:05:24.958
This motherfucker
made this fairy tale come true.

114
00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:26.958
Because I didn't believe
shit you said at first.

115
00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:28.875
This couldn't be
hurting my feelings any more.

116
00:05:28.958 --> 00:05:33.208
What we're saying is,
is that whatever spell or potion you used

117
00:05:33.291 --> 00:05:36.833
to trick that woman into liking you
isn't gonna work on her parents.

118
00:05:36.916 --> 00:05:39.541
Oh, you're worried about me with parents?

119
00:05:40.125 --> 00:05:43.166
The only people that love me
more than parents? Grandparents.

120
00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.875
You sit me next to a grandma at dinner,
watch the sparks fly.

121
00:05:47.458 --> 00:05:49.291
Oh, this is the diaper! She did it again!

122
00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:52.041
Hey! Hey! Just...

123
00:05:53.291 --> 00:05:56.083
Uh, why am I even doing this?
This isn't my job. This is Gary's job.

124
00:05:58.083 --> 00:05:59.083
Guys, where's Gary?

125
00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:03.791
All right, no more "accidentally" locking
Gary in the vault. I'm serious.

126
00:06:03.875 --> 00:06:05.833
It's this new security system
you designed.

127
00:06:05.916 --> 00:06:09.041
- Shit is mad complicated.
- It should be. It's a vault.

128
00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:12.500
It's state-of-the-art.
No one's getting in this bad boy.

129
00:06:12.583 --> 00:06:15.375
Oh! Is this the same one Phoebe King has?

130
00:06:17.083 --> 00:06:18.803
- Essentially.
- Who is Phoebe King?

131
00:06:18.875 --> 00:06:22.250
Phoebe King manages Atlas Reserve,
the top bank in the state.

132
00:06:22.333 --> 00:06:23.791
Not a top bank. Mmm-mmm.

133
00:06:23.875 --> 00:06:26.041
There's not, like,
an official ranking or anything.

134
00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:29.333
100% is, they wrote a whole article.
Yeah, that's the top bank in the state.

135
00:06:29.416 --> 00:06:31.625
It's a good bank, decent bank. Clean.

136
00:06:31.708 --> 00:06:34.916
Last conference,
Owen got called out by Phoebe King,

137
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.250
by her saying that a Butterball turkey
could break into our vault.

138
00:06:38.333 --> 00:06:40.250
I don't exactly remember it like that.

139
00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:42.250
And she called you a dickless troll.

140
00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:43.750
- Oh!
- Damn!

141
00:06:43.833 --> 00:06:45.208
Now, I tried not to laugh,

142
00:06:45.291 --> 00:06:47.476
but I couldn't help it
'cause it was fucking hysterical.

143
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.458
- Imagining you without a dick.
- Ooh!

144
00:06:49.541 --> 00:06:52.583
Just nothing but a smooth surface,
no genitalia at all.

145
00:06:52.666 --> 00:06:55.083
Dickless troll,
that's borderline unprofessional.

146
00:06:55.166 --> 00:06:56.291
Fucking hilarious.

147
00:06:56.375 --> 00:06:59.791

Isn't that nice? It's very nice!

I know. I know.

164
00:07:44.791 --> 00:07:48.250
- How come they're not showing up?
- They live in a cave in the jungle.

165
00:07:48.333 --> 00:07:50.416

- A little like Bin Laden, right.

166

- It's okay, I got it.

00:07:56.625 --> 00:07:58.708
Your Aunt Margie
isn't the biggest fan, so, shh.

169
00:07:58.791 --> 00:08:01.351
She said you got them so you
could get bigger tips when you strip.

170
00:08:01.375 --> 00:08:05.125
- Uh, once again, I'm not a stripper.
- My boyfriend's gonna get a tattoo.

171
00:08:05.208 --> 00:08:08.125
- Oh, yeah? Of what?
- My name across his lower back.

172
00:08:08.708 --> 00:08:10.916
Hey, cuz!

173
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.041
Jesus! Hi, buddy. Well, don't...

174
00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:15.333
How come I wasn't
invited to the, uh, bachelor party?

175
00:08:15.416 --> 00:08:19.333
- You know I'm, like, an EMT now, right?
- I do know that, yeah.

176
00:08:19.416 --> 00:08:22.000
Yeah, well, I'd love to give you
a ride in the ambulance.

177
00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:25.000
- You know, hit the siren, zip around town.
- That's fun.

178
00:08:25.083 --> 00:08:28.250
Yeah, maybe, uh, flatline you in the back,
go to the other side.

179
00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:31.166
Ask Grandpa Seymour
what it was like dying by, you know...

180
00:08:33.416 --> 00:08:35.125
Okay, stop it. All right.

181
00:08:35.208 --> 00:08:37.934
- Why is he doing that?
- That was a rumor. Stop.

182
00:08:37.958 --> 00:08:40.791
No, man. She walked in on it.
She was so sad when she found him.

183
00:08:40.875 --> 00:08:42.375
Guy's a legend, died beating off.

184
00:08:44.041 --> 00:08:46.561
I'm getting a phone call. Lucky for me.
I didn't even plan this.

185
00:08:46.625 --> 00:08:50.375
This just happened coincidentally.
Hey, storage space!

186
00:08:50.458 --> 00:08:52.208
Ah, thanks for returning my call!

187
00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:55.083
- This is Owen Browning again.
- What the fuck do you want?

188
00:08:55.958 --> 00:08:57.625
Well, I'm getting married in a week,

189
00:08:57.708 --> 00:09:01.083
so I'm putting together
a little photo montage.

190
00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:05.458
But here's the thing, I don't have
any photos of my fiancée's family.

191
00:09:05.541 --> 00:09:09.208
And rumor has it that they actually
have a unit in your storage facility.

192
00:09:09.291 --> 00:09:11.875
Um, it should be under the name McDermott.

193
00:09:11.958 --> 00:09:14.458
Do... Do you have the locker?

194
00:09:14.541 --> 00:09:16.901
- Oh, my God!
- I'm on fire!

195
00:09:16.958 --> 00:09:18.875
- EMT!
- Oh, shit.

196
00:09:18.958 --> 00:09:21.000
Soy sauce!

197
00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:23.291
Mom! That's not water!

198
00:09:30.083 --> 00:09:33.208
Yeah. You told me to call if anyone
asked about the McDermott locker.

199
00:09:33.291 --> 00:09:34.875
McDermott locker?

200
00:09:35.541 --> 00:09:36.583
Yes.

201
00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:38.041
Do you have a name?

202
00:09:38.125 --> 00:09:39.541
Owen Browning.

203
00:09:47.541 --> 00:09:49.000
These diamonds are shit.

204
00:10:03.708 --> 00:10:04.708
What is it?

205
00:10:04.791 --> 00:10:06.916
It's silly. I thought that...

206
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.500
I thought that button was
a trap door to a shark tank or something.

207
00:10:10.583 --> 00:10:13.375
Trap door? No!

208
00:10:13.875 --> 00:10:16.000
I just wanted someone
to come clean up this mess.

209
00:10:16.083 --> 00:10:17.916
- What mess?
- You.

210
00:10:22.291 --> 00:10:23.416
"Shark tank."

211
00:10:25.291 --> 00:10:27.125
Call the aquarium!

212
00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:31.250
Does your dad always keep
an extra shirt in the trunk of his car?

213
00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:32.791
Ha! Yeah, well...

214
00:10:33.375 --> 00:10:35.642
It's not the first time
he caught on fire in a restaurant.

215
00:10:35.666 --> 00:10:37.375
And then how about
when your niece asked me

216
00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:40.333
if my neck flaps in the wind
when I ride a bicycle?

217
00:10:40.416 --> 00:10:42.375
Thank you for not being offended.

218
00:10:42.458 --> 00:10:44.375
They are truly disturbed people.

219
00:10:44.458 --> 00:10:47.500
Ugh, God. Now, you're gonna
have to meet my family.

220
00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:52.416
- Are you worried they won't like me?
- No, not at all. Are you?

221
00:10:53.166 --> 00:10:54.166
No! Mmm-mmm.

222
00:10:54.250 --> 00:10:57.208
Not liking you
is like not liking Mr. Rogers.

223
00:10:57.291 --> 00:10:59.500
The Notorious F-R-E...

224
00:11:00.375 --> 00:11:01.375
D.

225
00:11:02.208 --> 00:11:05.291
- When do they come into town?
- Not until the night before the wedding.

226
00:11:05.375 --> 00:11:08.041
Oh! That gives me just enough time.

227
00:11:08.125 --> 00:11:09.750
Oh, yeah? Time for what?

228
00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:13.875
I've got
something special planned.

229
00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.666
Oh! Is that right?

230
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.916
Love it.

231
00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:23.291
Oh! Oh, you scared me.

232
00:11:23.375 --> 00:11:26.083
Okay, yeah, yeah.
Do that thing you like to do.

233
00:11:26.166 --> 00:11:27.416
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

Just makin' some prezzies
for Parker's parents.

239
00:11:43.541 --> 00:11:46.000
If you do me a favor,
could you not say the word "prezzies"?

240
00:11:46.083 --> 00:11:48.559
Know what I mean? Just own it, brother.
You do arts and crafts.

241
00:11:48.583 --> 00:11:49.583
You're a craft man.

242
00:11:49.666 --> 00:11:52.375
I think it's sexy as hell when a man
is passionate about something.

00:11:52.458 --> 00:11:54.708

No, you don't!

269
00:13:11.833 --> 00:13:13.916
- Oh, shit! Well done.
- Oh, shit.

270
00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.750
- Oh, I'm so sorry, honey.
- You all right there, Owen?

271
00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:20.000
She took a self-defense class.
Looks like money well spent.

272
00:13:20.083 --> 00:13:21.166
Please don't kill me.

273
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:24.351
- Let's get this little shit up. Come on.
- Yeah, let's get him. Come on, get up.

274
00:13:24.375 --> 00:13:28.083
There you go. We're not gonna kill you.
We're Parker's parents.

275
00:13:28.166 --> 00:13:29.166
Mmm-hmm.

276
00:13:29.583 --> 00:13:32.041
- Oh! Okay.
- Yeah.

277
00:13:32.125 --> 00:13:33.583
Okay, yeah!

278
00:13:33.666 --> 00:13:37.125
Well, Mr. and Mrs. McDermott,
it is an honor to...

279
00:13:37.208 --> 00:13:39.666
Oh! Come here! Come here!

280
00:13:43.708 --> 00:13:46.875
Let's forget the formalities, shall we?
"Mr. McDermott," all that crap.

281
00:13:46.958 --> 00:13:47.958
- Yeah.
- Call me Billy.

282
00:13:49.291 --> 00:13:50.458
Okay, Billy.

283
00:13:52.625 --> 00:13:56.708
Oh, well, you must be Parker's dad
because you two kiss exactly the same.

284
00:13:58.166 --> 00:13:59.541
- I'm Lilly.
- Hey, Lilly.

285
00:14:00.041 --> 00:14:01.791
- Yeah, thanks, that's good.
- Okay, yeah.

286
00:14:01.875 --> 00:14:03.675
- Mom?
- Oh, look who's here!

287
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:05.875
- Aw, baby! Oh, my God!
- Dad? What?

288
00:14:07.125 --> 00:14:09.375
You're here!
What are you doing here?

289
00:14:09.458 --> 00:14:12.875
Yeah, the flight was early, and, uh...
Actually, you were singing.

290
00:14:12.958 --> 00:14:15.833
I heard you singing a little ditty
about boinking our daughter.

291
00:14:15.916 --> 00:14:17.416
Really?

292
00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:20.500
Uh, just a little ditty
that I was doing in private.

293
00:14:20.583 --> 00:14:23.625
Didn't know it was, uh,
in front of my future in-laws.

294
00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:26.500
- How'd... How'd you guys get in?
- The door was unlocked.

295
00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:29.333
That is weird, 'cause
I never forget to lock the front door.

296
00:14:29.416 --> 00:14:32.041
Are you calling my wife a liar? Huh?

297
00:14:33.541 --> 00:14:36.041
You calling my wife a liar?
Is that it?

298
00:14:36.125 --> 00:14:39.166
I just walk in here
and now you're accusing her?

299
00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.208
You want me to hit your face...

300
00:14:41.291 --> 00:14:42.916
Ha-ha-ha!

301
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:47.583
You were joking! It's a joke!

302
00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:51.125
It's a joke! It's a joke! Okay!

303
00:14:52.666 --> 00:14:55.000
So, how do you like your prezzies?

304
00:14:55.583 --> 00:14:56.875
I'm wearing it, aren't I?

305
00:14:58.500 --> 00:15:02.458
Well, should we tell them our story?
We have a really cute meet-cute.

306
00:15:02.541 --> 00:15:04.125
It's, uh, you're gonna love this story.

307
00:15:04.208 --> 00:15:07.750
There's one thing you need to know
about me, my family has hip issues.

308
00:15:08.333 --> 00:15:10.541
And, obviously, wanted to get ahead of it.

309
00:15:10.625 --> 00:15:13.208
Went to the doctor.
She said, "Have you tried yoga?"

310
00:15:13.291 --> 00:15:15.000
Got a coupon.

311
00:15:15.083 --> 00:15:16.958
Went to my first yoga class...

312
00:15:17.458 --> 00:15:18.875
It was my class.

313
00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:21.333
I was teaching the class!
I mean, what are the odds?

314
00:15:21.416 --> 00:15:22.416
- Crazy!
- Right?

315
00:15:22.500 --> 00:15:24.958
That's amazing.

316
00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:29.041
So then I noticed that halfway
through the class, Owen's in child's pose.

317
00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:30.833
Yep. Okay, so get this.

318
00:15:30.916 --> 00:15:32.791
Okay, I'm in child's pose.

319
00:15:32.875 --> 00:15:37.208
And while I'm in child's pose,
I pass out, but no one notices. Look.

320
00:15:37.291 --> 00:15:38.166
Look.

321
00:15:38.250 --> 00:15:40.392
If I was unconscious right now,
you couldn't even tell.

322
00:15:40.416 --> 00:15:41.856
- Right?
- Oh, yeah.

323
00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:45.000
So then everyone leaves, class is over,

324
00:15:45.083 --> 00:15:47.416
and I notice that
Owen's still in child's pose.

325
00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:48.625
And I think to myself,

326
00:15:48.708 --> 00:15:52.125
"Oh, fuck. This guy just died.
He's dead. He's a goner."

327
00:15:52.208 --> 00:15:54.541
- Mmm-mmm. But I didn't.
- Nope.

328
00:15:54.625 --> 00:15:57.333
Then, when Parker unfolded me,
and I came to,

329
00:15:57.416 --> 00:16:00.583
I looked up at her big, beautiful smile,
and I realized...

330
00:16:01.958 --> 00:16:04.458
"This is the woman
I'm gonna spend the rest of my life with."

331
00:16:04.541 --> 00:16:06.583
- And you were right.
- Yes, I was.

332
00:16:07.291 --> 00:16:08.125
Aww.

333
00:16:08.208 --> 00:16:10.708
- And then you asked her out.
- No, actually.

334
00:16:10.791 --> 00:16:13.591
I went to her class for a year and a half
and she finally asked me out.

335
00:16:18.208 --> 00:16:21.125
♪ Honey dew, honey dew, honey dew ♪

336
00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:23.958
♪ Honey dew, honey dew, honey dew ♪

337
00:16:25.083 --> 00:16:27.041
I can't find anyone
to cover my class,

338
00:16:27.125 --> 00:16:28.458
so I'm just gonna have to cancel.

339
00:16:28.541 --> 00:16:30.501
- Mmm-mmm.
- Make sure my parents are okay.

340
00:16:30.583 --> 00:16:32.583
I'm not gonna
let you get in trouble at work.

341
00:16:32.666 --> 00:16:36.208
I have 178 sick days already saved up.
I already called in.

342
00:16:36.291 --> 00:16:40.208
- It's not about... No... Actually, babe...
- I got you, don't worry about it!

343
00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:42.500
- Don't worry, I got it! Oh, hey!
- Aw!

344
00:16:42.583 --> 00:16:44.708
- Good morning, future family.
- Hi!

345
00:16:44.791 --> 00:16:47.666
- Good morning! Morning, Dad.
- Nice to see you. Good morning.

346
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:51.458
So I have to go into work today,
but Owen is taking his first day off

347
00:16:51.541 --> 00:16:53.981
since he started at the bank,
he's gonna show you guys around.

348
00:16:54.041 --> 00:16:55.500
- Right, babe?
- Exciting!

349
00:16:59.416 --> 00:17:04.791
I don't like my tushy touched,
and she finds it hilarious.

350
00:17:04.875 --> 00:17:07.958
- I do!
- It scares me... something about it.

351
00:17:08.041 --> 00:17:10.583
- All right, well, I'll see you tonight.
- Okay. Bye.

352
00:17:10.666 --> 00:17:13.875
- You two, behave. All right? Be nice.
- Bye, bye, darling.

353
00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.601
- It means a lot to him. Be good.
- Love you. We'll be good.

354
00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:18.000
- Bye! Love you!
- Bye!

355
00:17:20.166 --> 00:17:22.958
Okay! Oh! You want some OJ?
Good. Good, good, good.

356
00:17:23.041 --> 00:17:23.875
I do.

357
00:17:23.958 --> 00:17:25.541
So, hope you guys are hungry,

358
00:17:25.625 --> 00:17:26.875
because I've got...

359
00:17:28.958 --> 00:17:30.875
baked eggs Florentine.

360
00:17:30.958 --> 00:17:33.083
We have some roasted...

361
00:17:33.166 --> 00:17:34.708
Got in there deep.

362
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.125
Okay, uh... Well, enough about breakfast.

363
00:17:39.208 --> 00:17:42.666
I hope you're ready to have some fun
because I got us tickets

364
00:17:42.750 --> 00:17:46.375
to a South American pottery exhibition.

365
00:17:47.833 --> 00:17:48.833
Why?

366
00:17:49.666 --> 00:17:53.708
Because you guys were living
with the Yanomami tribe in the Amazon...

367
00:17:53.791 --> 00:17:54.666
Oh! Oh, yeah.

368
00:17:54.750 --> 00:17:57.416
...who obviously are
known for their exquisite pottery.

369
00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:01.250
We spent so many years with that tribe
that we're all potteried out.

370
00:18:01.333 --> 00:18:05.333
All right, well, let's go
to the next step of our adventure.

371
00:18:05.416 --> 00:18:06.791
The Holocaust Museum!

372
00:18:08.916 --> 00:18:12.875
Honestly, I've been there, like... I would...
They've got an amazing food court!

373
00:18:14.916 --> 00:18:15.916
Okay!

374
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:19.916
Look, we're not into pottery
and we're not into Holocaust awareness.

375
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.083
Fine. What do you guys want to do?

376
00:18:26.875 --> 00:18:29.708
Pull the chute!
Pull the chute!

377
00:18:29.791 --> 00:18:34.125
Not until you convince me
why I should let you marry my daughter!

378
00:18:34.208 --> 00:18:38.708
Oh, God!
She's my best friend, and I love her!

379
00:18:38.791 --> 00:18:40.583
Oh, God! Oh, God!

380
00:18:40.666 --> 00:18:43.833
- I dog sit! I tip 20%!
- Not good enough!

381
00:18:44.583 --> 00:18:47.208
I'll never have sex with her again.

382
00:18:47.291 --> 00:18:49.833
- Keep going!
- I'm pulling the cord!

383
00:18:49.916 --> 00:18:52.416
That's my cock, you idiot!

384
00:19:02.791 --> 00:19:06.500
You know, I was thinking
about choosing a Shrek character,

385
00:19:06.583 --> 00:19:08.708
because it's my favorite,
but I don't know,

386
00:19:08.791 --> 00:19:10.666
this moon is really speaking to me, right?

387
00:19:10.750 --> 00:19:13.041
Okay. That looks pretty...

388
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:16.333
Ow! What? What...

389
00:19:17.041 --> 00:19:18.333
Ahh!

390
00:19:19.375 --> 00:19:20.875
Ahh!

391
00:19:20.958 --> 00:19:22.750
Whoo!

392
00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:30.541
Let's go! Oh, man.

393
00:19:30.625 --> 00:19:33.166
Could you guys believe I got a tattoo?

394
00:19:33.708 --> 00:19:37.416
Who even am I right now?
This is a tattoo, it's a moon.

395
00:19:38.083 --> 00:19:40.041
I'm like a wolf.

396
00:19:41.416 --> 00:19:44.875
Bill, why don't you get us another round?
I'm not nearly drunk enough.

397
00:19:44.958 --> 00:19:46.500
That's a good idea, Lilly.

398
00:19:46.583 --> 00:19:48.791
I'll come with! Let's go!

399
00:19:52.541 --> 00:19:53.791
Mind the shoes, Owen.

400
00:19:53.875 --> 00:19:55.625
My bad, Mister Dad.

401
00:19:57.625 --> 00:19:59.958
Okay, that one was a little on you,

402
00:20:00.041 --> 00:20:02.416
'cause you didn't turn around
that quickly. That's okay.

403
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.541
- Sit!
- Yeah.

404
00:20:03.625 --> 00:20:04.625
Stay.

405
00:20:04.666 --> 00:20:05.666
Okay!

406
00:20:13.291 --> 00:20:14.875
- I'll be right back.
- Oh, no.

407
00:20:14.958 --> 00:20:17.833
I'll go. You keep him company. All right?

408
00:20:20.291 --> 00:20:22.750
God!
He is just the coolest, isn't he?

409
00:20:22.833 --> 00:20:25.833
It is so awesome
that you get to have sex with him.

410
00:20:25.916 --> 00:20:27.916
- Really?
- And he smells so good!

411
00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000
It smells like...

412
00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:31.166
sandalwood and...

413
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:32.083
and danger.

414
00:20:32.166 --> 00:20:35.083
- It's Stetson. Cologne.
- Is that what that is?

415
00:20:39.333 --> 00:20:40.833
How you doing, big fella?

416
00:20:46.375 --> 00:20:50.458
Nice to see you again, Billy.
You look hella fine.

417
00:20:51.041 --> 00:20:52.250
Ah, if you say so.

418
00:20:52.333 --> 00:20:55.916
So tell me, what does
a bank manager do, exactly?

419
00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:57.625
What does a bank manager not do?

420
00:20:57.708 --> 00:21:00.583
I manage all of the employees.

421
00:21:01.416 --> 00:21:03.833
And we have 12.

422
00:21:03.916 --> 00:21:05.000
Really?

423
00:21:05.083 --> 00:21:07.541
And I handle all the security,
the whole dang bank.

424
00:21:07.625 --> 00:21:10.875
- How did you find us?
- That little cunt over there.

425
00:21:10.958 --> 00:21:14.041
He called about the storage locker.

426
00:21:14.625 --> 00:21:16.416
- Did he?
- New colleague?

427
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:18.958
Uh, no, he's just a family friend.

428
00:21:19.916 --> 00:21:23.458
He's an idiot.
Doesn't know what's going on.

429
00:21:24.833 --> 00:21:26.666
He looks like a fucking idiot.

430
00:21:28.166 --> 00:21:29.166
- Yup.
- Billy!

431
00:21:29.208 --> 00:21:30.458
That guy rocks!

432
00:21:43.083 --> 00:21:44.083
Yuck.

433
00:21:48.958 --> 00:21:52.708
Jesus, there you are.
Oh, you smell like my stepdad's car.

434
00:21:52.791 --> 00:21:54.750
So, uh,
how did it go with your in-laws?

435
00:21:54.833 --> 00:21:58.541
Was it regular bad,
or like really, really terrible?

436
00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:00.708
It was incredible.

437
00:22:00.791 --> 00:22:03.250
I've never met anyone
like these people before.

438
00:22:03.333 --> 00:22:05.208
We went skydiving.

439
00:22:05.291 --> 00:22:06.708
We got very drunk.

440
00:22:06.791 --> 00:22:08.208
I did a little dancing.

441
00:22:08.291 --> 00:22:11.458
I finally felt like I was
part of the cool crowd in high school,

442
00:22:11.541 --> 00:22:15.958
like I'm a skateboarder,
or like I vandalize stuff or something.

443
00:22:16.041 --> 00:22:19.000
I don't, but it feels like I could.

444
00:22:19.583 --> 00:22:22.416
It was fun. It was almost too much fun.

445
00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.750
Let's just pray to the banking gods
that we have a nice, chill day.

446
00:22:26.833 --> 00:22:29.500
Everyone,
on the ground, now!

447
00:22:32.458 --> 00:22:34.041
Ground! Let's go!

448
00:22:34.125 --> 00:22:35.875
Move!

449
00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:39.625
Go.

450
00:22:39.708 --> 00:22:41.791
You, hurry up.

451
00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:46.291
Get down! Get down!

452
00:22:58.833 --> 00:23:00.291
Two minutes.

453
00:23:00.375 --> 00:23:04.458
Look, listen, listen.
I am fully cooperating in every way.

454
00:23:04.541 --> 00:23:07.041
And in that spirit, I have to let you know

455
00:23:07.125 --> 00:23:10.750
that this is a state-of-the-art,
completely impenetrable security system.

456
00:23:10.833 --> 00:23:13.750
And there is no way
you can pass there in under two...

457
00:23:13.833 --> 00:23:16.416
That was
an extremely lucky guess.

458
00:23:20.750 --> 00:23:22.500
So you know about the fingerprint bypass?

459
00:23:22.583 --> 00:23:25.041
However, this is where
our journey ends, because there's...

460
00:23:25.125 --> 00:23:26.708
Shut up! Read.

461
00:23:28.375 --> 00:23:29.500

- Fill that up.

Did you want any small bills
in case you have to tip or anything?

473

Stop smiling at me.

477
00:24:30.041 --> 00:24:31.041

it's not too late to do the right thing.

I'm sorry.

Thank you
for your cooperation, everyone.

483
00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.666
Especially you, Owen.

484
00:25:00.250 --> 00:25:01.416
You!

I know when I see bad guys walking in.

488
00:25:17.333 --> 00:25:20.208
So I tried to stop 'em myself, but, um...
I slipped.

489
00:25:21.666 --> 00:25:23.375
Could we not write that down?

490
00:25:23.958 --> 00:25:26.958
I ain't see shit,
I don't know shit, I don't talk to cops.

"We"?

505
00:26:20.875 --> 00:26:23.583
I'm Special Agent
Roger Oldham, FBI.

506
00:26:23.666 --> 00:26:27.125
So what can you tell me
about the folks that robbed your bank?

507
00:26:28.125 --> 00:26:31.291
Can you describe them
for me physically? Anything?

508
00:26:33.333 --> 00:26:36.125
No, no, can't.
They were wearing masks.

509
00:26:36.208 --> 00:26:39.583
Does the name "The Ghost Bandits"
mean anything to you?

510
00:26:40.291 --> 00:26:41.458
Yeah, I'm a bank manager.

511
00:26:41.541 --> 00:26:43.958
They're the most notorious bank robbers
in American history.

512
00:26:44.041 --> 00:26:45.500
They robbed over a hundred banks.

513
00:26:45.583 --> 00:26:47.166
They move from state to state,

514
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:49.750
sometimes they disappear
for years at a time.

515
00:26:49.833 --> 00:26:51.875
Do you think...

516
00:26:51.958 --> 00:26:56.541
Do you think it was...
the Ghost Bandits that robbed this bank?

517
00:26:57.666 --> 00:27:02.125
Everything in my gut tells me it's them.

518
00:27:03.125 --> 00:27:06.750
Except one thing has been bugging me.

519
00:27:08.833 --> 00:27:14.041
How they gained access to your vault.

520
00:27:17.250 --> 00:27:21.000
It's all right, Owen. It's okay.

521
00:27:21.083 --> 00:27:23.208
Breathe, breathe.

522
00:27:23.291 --> 00:27:26.250
- There you go, in through your nose.
- Blow it out.

523
00:27:26.333 --> 00:27:28.666
- Give it a big blow. Good boy.
- Blow, blow, blow.

524
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.916
Jesus.

525
00:27:38.708 --> 00:27:39.708
Oh.

526
00:27:40.166 --> 00:27:43.083
Okay, you know what?
We're done here, all right? That's enough.

527
00:27:43.166 --> 00:27:45.458
- You've probably had enough.
- Very emotional.

528
00:27:46.375 --> 00:27:47.416
Well done, Owen.

529
00:27:49.875 --> 00:27:50.875
Mmm.

530
00:27:52.083 --> 00:27:53.875
In case anything jogs your memory...

531
00:27:54.875 --> 00:27:56.833
the top number, 24/7.

532
00:27:56.916 --> 00:27:58.125
The bottom number...

533
00:27:59.375 --> 00:28:00.750
don't call that one.

534
00:28:24.416 --> 00:28:26.416
Do we think we might
be a little more comfortable

535
00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:28.166
if someone was in the front seat?

536
00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:29.250
Nope.

537
00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:32.083
- Mmm.
- We're here for you.

538
00:28:32.166 --> 00:28:33.166
Yeah.

539
00:28:36.666 --> 00:28:37.666
Come on.

540
00:28:41.458 --> 00:28:42.375
Bingo.

541
00:28:42.458 --> 00:28:43.666
Whose car is this?

542
00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:46.625
It's yours, Owen. It's all yours.

543
00:28:46.708 --> 00:28:50.000
Isn't that nice? My parents got us a car
without asking us first.

544
00:28:50.083 --> 00:28:51.833
It's just a little wedding present.

545
00:28:51.916 --> 00:28:55.416
We thought you deserved something better
than that, uh, wussy wagon of yours.

546
00:28:55.500 --> 00:28:59.916
So this is what you were doing all day?
You were buying a hot rod?

547
00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.083
There's something about it
that just screams Owen T. Browning.

548
00:29:03.166 --> 00:29:05.666
- Don't you agree?
- Yeah! It's got your name all over it!

549
00:29:07.208 --> 00:29:09.958
I love it! Oh, yeah!

550
00:29:10.041 --> 00:29:13.125
I love it, thank you.
Um, I can't wait to drive it.

551
00:29:13.208 --> 00:29:15.833
- Want to take it for a spin now?
- No.

552
00:29:19.791 --> 00:29:23.541
I'm like 85% certain it's them.
I have to tell Parker.

553
00:29:23.625 --> 00:29:27.166
If you falsely accuse
your fiancée's parents of robbing a bank,

554
00:29:27.250 --> 00:29:28.625
that is relationship suicide!

555
00:29:28.708 --> 00:29:31.375
So what am I supposed to do, hmm?
Pretend like it didn't happen?

556
00:29:31.458 --> 00:29:32.500
Hell, yes!

557
00:29:32.583 --> 00:29:36.000
Let me tell you something, I spent 80%
of my life acting like shit didn't happen.

558
00:29:36.083 --> 00:29:39.208
Three weeks ago,
I spilled some Lucky Charms in my bed,

559
00:29:39.291 --> 00:29:41.083
I still ain't said shit about it.

560
00:29:41.166 --> 00:29:44.625
And, besides, didn't you tell me
you gave them the code to the vault?

561
00:29:44.708 --> 00:29:47.458
Well, yeah, but I was wasted
and I was trying to impress them.

562
00:29:47.541 --> 00:29:51.250
Yeah, that means if they robbed the bank,

563
00:29:52.250 --> 00:29:53.125
you did too.

564
00:29:53.208 --> 00:29:55.166
No, I didn't.

565
00:29:57.750 --> 00:30:00.791
- You gave them the fuckin' code!
- Are you saying I'm an accessory?

566
00:30:00.875 --> 00:30:04.041
No, you ain't no accessory,
you are the fucking mastermind!

567
00:30:04.125 --> 00:30:06.791
This is gangster!
Okay, look, can I be honest with you?

568
00:30:06.875 --> 00:30:09.166
I steal, too, from the bank. That's right.

569
00:30:09.250 --> 00:30:11.166
I haven't bought toilet paper
in seven years.

570
00:30:12.291 --> 00:30:13.458
- That was you?
- Mmm-hmm!

571
00:30:13.541 --> 00:30:17.625
From the men's and the ladies' bathroom.
Come on, that's execution.

572
00:30:17.708 --> 00:30:20.559
I don't care about the toilet paper.
I don't care about the toilet paper.

573
00:30:20.583 --> 00:30:23.041
- Hey! Okay, goodbye, thank you.
- Hey! Who was that?

574
00:30:25.583 --> 00:30:27.625
The baker. They just called.

575
00:30:27.708 --> 00:30:32.458
They said there was a big commotion
over there and they can't make the cake.

576
00:30:32.541 --> 00:30:34.208
Wait, what? You're serious?

577
00:30:34.291 --> 00:30:35.666
- I know!
- What happened?

578
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:38.416
- The baker died.
- Oh, my God!

579
00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.833
- How?
- Kicked in the chest by a horse.

580
00:30:40.916 --> 00:30:42.125
- Jesus!
- Yeah.

581
00:30:42.208 --> 00:30:44.125
Heart exploded on impact.

582
00:30:44.208 --> 00:30:45.583
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

583
00:30:45.666 --> 00:30:48.500
Hey, don't be sad! Hey, don't be sad!

584
00:30:48.583 --> 00:30:51.666
It's okay, 'cause the...
the baker was racist.

585
00:30:52.666 --> 00:30:55.583
- Yeah, like, a bad racist.
- Are there good racists?

586
00:30:55.666 --> 00:30:58.541
Well, my grandmother, so...
Anyway, what's up?

587
00:30:59.041 --> 00:31:02.333
Uh, my parents made samosas,
so I was just coming to tell you.

588
00:31:03.791 --> 00:31:06.500
How light and fun! Samosas! I love that.

589
00:31:06.583 --> 00:31:09.583
- Okay, I'll see you down there.
- Just take your time.

590
00:31:09.666 --> 00:31:11.208
- All right?
- It'll be okay.

591
00:31:11.291 --> 00:31:14.333
- It's all right, we'll get a new cake.
- All right. Yeah.

592
00:31:14.416 --> 00:31:18.750
Definitely not a racist this time.
All right, love you.

593
00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Hi.

594
00:31:24.541 --> 00:31:26.833
I'm going to need to cancel a cake order.

595
00:31:26.916 --> 00:31:30.041
Yeah, my fiancée was kicked
in the head by a horse.

596
00:31:31.833 --> 00:31:33.541
Huh.

597
00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.041
Why are you so nervous, Owen?

598
00:31:44.166 --> 00:31:46.166
So, I know this might sound crazy,

599
00:31:46.791 --> 00:31:48.458
but I think Parker's parents

600
00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.208
might be criminals.

601
00:31:51.291 --> 00:31:53.541
- Yeah!
- Well, of course they're criminals.

602
00:31:53.625 --> 00:31:55.945
Why do you think
they're skipping their daughter's wedding?

603
00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.541
They're coming
to the fucking wedding! Okay?

604
00:31:59.125 --> 00:32:01.541
They're literally coming!
We're...

605
00:32:03.250 --> 00:32:04.250
Okay.

606
00:32:05.083 --> 00:32:07.791
I think that they are the people
that robbed my bank.

607
00:32:07.875 --> 00:32:10.125
- No! How do you know?
- I don't.

608
00:32:10.208 --> 00:32:13.458
But I'm not gonna turn Parker's life
upside down unless I do know for a fact,

609
00:32:13.541 --> 00:32:14.666
so I need your help, okay?

610
00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.958
Okay, okay, here they come.
Do that thing you guys do.

611
00:32:17.041 --> 00:32:17.916
What thing?

612
00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.208
That thing where you ask highly-invasive,
inappropriate personal questions.

613
00:32:21.291 --> 00:32:22.666
Hmm? Okay, come on!

614
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:25.416
Hi, guys! Hey!

615
00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.875
Honey. You sure you're up for this?

616
00:32:27.958 --> 00:32:29.718
- Yeah, you?
- Oh, yeah. I took a weed gummy.

617
00:32:29.791 --> 00:32:33.791
Smart! Billy and Lilly McDermott,
meet my parents Neil and Margie Browning.

618
00:32:33.875 --> 00:32:36.083
- Pleasure to me you, Neil.
- It's my pleasure.

619
00:32:36.916 --> 00:32:38.916
- You're very attractive.
- Oh, thank you.

620
00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000
That's not a compliment.
For me, it's too much.

621
00:32:53.083 --> 00:32:54.750
Well, hi, there.

622
00:32:54.833 --> 00:32:55.875
- Hi, hello.
- Hi.

623
00:32:56.666 --> 00:32:58.208
Mmm! Oh, wow!

624
00:32:58.291 --> 00:33:02.958
Speaking of attractive,
you have absolutely flawless skin.

625
00:33:03.041 --> 00:33:04.625
What do you use?

626
00:33:04.708 --> 00:33:05.708
Soap.

627
00:33:06.791 --> 00:33:09.500
- Perhaps we should have some cocktails?
- Yeah, cocktails.

628
00:33:09.583 --> 00:33:11.083
The sun is still out.

629
00:33:13.041 --> 00:33:15.291
Okay, we got a table.
Let's sit down.

630
00:33:15.375 --> 00:33:16.708
It's gonna be fun!

631
00:33:17.416 --> 00:33:19.875
And then I said,

632
00:33:19.958 --> 00:33:21.833
"We don't need a gondolier!"

633
00:33:21.916 --> 00:33:24.125
Lilly, she pushes
the wee fella off the boat,

634
00:33:24.208 --> 00:33:26.291
and we start paddling up the Grand Canal.

635
00:33:29.833 --> 00:33:32.666
So, Billy, Lilly,
let me ask you something.

636
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:33.750
Yeah, shoot.

637
00:33:33.833 --> 00:33:36.833
- Have you ever committed a felony?
- Mmm-mmm.

638
00:33:36.916 --> 00:33:37.916
No, no, no!

639
00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.583
Now, if we're gonna be family,
we need to know if they're criminals, so...

640
00:33:42.083 --> 00:33:44.458
- Stop. Don't.
- Give me that. Are you criminals?

641
00:33:44.541 --> 00:33:46.250
My parents aren't criminals.

642
00:33:46.333 --> 00:33:47.875
No, that's okay, baby.

643
00:33:47.958 --> 00:33:51.958
I'm sure our lifestyle seems a little,
um, unconventional to the Brownings.

644
00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:56.166
Well, yeah, I mean they live
in the jungle with the edamame people.

645
00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:57.333
No, that's a bean.

646
00:33:57.416 --> 00:33:59.250
- What's the name?
- Yanomami.

647
00:33:59.333 --> 00:34:00.166
What'd I say?

648
00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:03.291
You said edamame,
like at a Japanese restaurant.

649
00:34:03.375 --> 00:34:06.625
They are the people
of waitheri, totihi, peheti.

650
00:34:06.708 --> 00:34:08.041
What is that now?

651
00:34:08.125 --> 00:34:10.958
It's a common Yanomami phrase.
I'm sure you've heard it.

652
00:34:11.041 --> 00:34:14.666
- Honey, what are you doing?
- Nothing! Just striking up a convo.

653
00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.625
Owen, if I didn't know any better,
I'd think you were quizzing us.

654
00:34:19.708 --> 00:34:22.875
No! It's just... You lived
with the Yanomamis for two years.

655
00:34:22.958 --> 00:34:27.000
I'm sure you know what the phrase
"waitheri, totihi, peheti" means.

656
00:34:31.083 --> 00:34:32.416
It means courage...

657
00:34:33.583 --> 00:34:35.541
beauty, and truth.

658
00:34:36.250 --> 00:34:40.916
And if we seem a little confused,
it's because your accent is so atrocious,

659
00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.958
it's an affront
to the Yanomami people and their god!

660
00:34:48.291 --> 00:34:51.041
Owen, what the hell is wrong with you?

661
00:34:51.125 --> 00:34:55.000
Anyway!
The Amazon is a wondrous place.

662
00:34:55.083 --> 00:34:56.875
You two would love it.

663
00:34:56.958 --> 00:35:01.541
Well, we don't travel.
Um, Neil has traveler's diarrhea.

664
00:35:02.125 --> 00:35:04.666
- It's not just when I travel.
- Yeah.

665
00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:08.416
Oh, Margie,
I bet under that cautious exterior,

666
00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:12.541
there's a bubbling free spirit
waiting to get out.

667
00:35:12.625 --> 00:35:17.125
Oh, no doubt this one
was really wild back in the day.

668
00:35:17.208 --> 00:35:23.708
Uh, well, once,
before I was pregnant with Owen, I, um...

669
00:35:23.791 --> 00:35:26.333
Well, I participated in an orgy.

670
00:35:27.458 --> 00:35:29.166
- What?
- Yeah!

671
00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:30.916
- Mom, an orgy?
- Yeah!

672
00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.041
An orgy?

673
00:35:32.125 --> 00:35:33.333
- Yes!
- Yep.

674
00:35:33.416 --> 00:35:34.958
I'm probably saying it wrong,

675
00:35:35.041 --> 00:35:38.541
but it's that thing where you go
and you just fuck everybody.

676
00:35:38.625 --> 00:35:42.208
- Oh, yeah, that's an orgy, all right.
- I had a lot of orgies.

677
00:35:42.291 --> 00:35:44.916
That's where she met Dan Marino!

678
00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.916
- The football player?
- Yeah!

679
00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.458
Well, it was either there or JCPenney.

680
00:35:49.541 --> 00:35:53.041
Dan Marino doesn't shop at JCPenney.
He's a Hall of Famer.

681
00:35:53.125 --> 00:35:55.291
You met Dan Marino at the orgy.

682
00:35:55.375 --> 00:35:58.416
- Oh, Jesus Christ! So is Dad my dad?
- Of course I'm your dad!

683
00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:02.250
Don't be ridiculous! Why do you think
you have the Browning lower back hair?

684
00:36:02.333 --> 00:36:07.500
I've seen you play sports,
I know sure as shit it wasn't Dan Marino!

685
00:36:08.583 --> 00:36:10.208
- Wait, what?
- Dan Marino!

686
00:36:10.291 --> 00:36:12.500
- Here's to Danny boy.
- Danny!

687
00:36:12.583 --> 00:36:15.041
To Danny boy!

688
00:36:15.125 --> 00:36:18.791
Whoo! Touchdown!

689
00:36:28.083 --> 00:36:32.000
Hey. Okay, look.
So here's me, here's my dad.

690
00:36:32.083 --> 00:36:35.083
The nose, the same beady,
little dead eyes.

691
00:36:35.166 --> 00:36:36.250
It's the same, right?

692
00:36:37.083 --> 00:36:40.500
- And the lower back hair.
- Sweetie, I've seen your back hair.

693
00:36:41.625 --> 00:36:44.333
Okay, of course,
but you haven't seen my dad's.

694
00:36:44.416 --> 00:36:47.833
- Should we FaceTime him?
- No. Can we just talk for a sec?

695
00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:51.791
Yeah!

696
00:36:52.875 --> 00:36:53.875
Everything okay?

697
00:36:54.875 --> 00:36:56.125
What was that at dinner?

698
00:36:56.208 --> 00:37:00.041
Oh, I don't know, just the fact
that Dan Marino fucked my mom.

699
00:37:00.125 --> 00:37:03.291
Yeah, I... I know.
I know, and your bank got robbed.

700
00:37:03.375 --> 00:37:04.541
And he's a big man.

701
00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:07.416
He is. That's true. Um...

702
00:37:08.708 --> 00:37:12.875
Look, I know you've been through a lot,
and that's extremely traumatic,

703
00:37:12.958 --> 00:37:14.250
both things,

704
00:37:14.333 --> 00:37:16.625
but is there something else going on?

705
00:37:17.875 --> 00:37:19.916
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

706
00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.666
I won't get mad.

707
00:37:22.833 --> 00:37:23.833
Okay?

708
00:37:24.250 --> 00:37:25.458
Okay, all right.

709
00:37:27.416 --> 00:37:29.375
All right.

710
00:37:32.458 --> 00:37:34.333
So the reason I've been acting weird...

711
00:37:36.791 --> 00:37:38.291
I think your parents robbed my bank.

712
00:37:41.166 --> 00:37:42.666
What?

713
00:37:44.916 --> 00:37:46.833
- You're being serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious!

714
00:37:46.916 --> 00:37:49.583
- One of the robbers knew my name.
- It's on the bank website.

715
00:37:49.666 --> 00:37:51.666
But when I stepped on his heel,
he turned back,

716
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:53.375
and he looked at me just like your dad.

717
00:37:53.458 --> 00:37:54.750
You said they had masks on.

718
00:37:54.833 --> 00:37:57.000
Yes, they were wearing masks,
but it was the same

719
00:37:57.083 --> 00:37:59.250
very specific disdain of me.

720
00:37:59.333 --> 00:38:01.833
It's a vibe thing, you know? And...

721
00:38:01.916 --> 00:38:05.875
And they knew that
"She left me roses by the stairs"

722
00:38:05.958 --> 00:38:07.918
was the voice activation code
to get in the vault,

723
00:38:07.958 --> 00:38:10.392
which I'm pretty sure
I told your mom about when I was wasted.

724
00:38:10.416 --> 00:38:13.125
Right, okay.
Well, does anyone else know the code?

725
00:38:13.708 --> 00:38:15.208
Just a couple... Just... Yeah.

726
00:38:15.291 --> 00:38:17.875
Tyree, Gary, Marisol.

727
00:38:18.666 --> 00:38:22.750
I think I told my therapist once,
but I don't think she listens to me.

728
00:38:23.375 --> 00:38:24.208
- Wow!
- Okay.

729
00:38:24.291 --> 00:38:26.416
You were the one
who said that they're a lot.

730
00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.458
I meant that they have big personalities,
not that they rob banks.

731
00:38:30.541 --> 00:38:32.708
I'm not saying
that they are bank robbers!

732
00:38:32.791 --> 00:38:35.958
I'm saying that there's a possibility
that they're bank robbers.

733
00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:38.250
I'm just floating the idea out there.

734
00:38:38.333 --> 00:38:42.416
Well, now, I'm just floating the idea
that you've lost your fucking mind.

735
00:38:57.875 --> 00:39:00.541
I can't believe
we have to take this shit box.

736
00:39:04.541 --> 00:39:06.750
Bank robbing son of a bitch!

737
00:39:17.958 --> 00:39:21.083
Oh, Jesus Christ, this thing moves.

738
00:39:32.833 --> 00:39:34.125
Sor... Sorry!

739
00:39:35.583 --> 00:39:36.583
Sorry.

740
00:39:49.333 --> 00:39:51.250
Okay, yep! Sorry!

741
00:39:56.250 --> 00:39:58.416
...the fuck up!

742
00:40:03.208 --> 00:40:04.375
Whoo!

743
00:40:05.041 --> 00:40:07.083
Okay. Oh, that was scary.

744
00:40:17.833 --> 00:40:20.000
- Thank you, OnStar.
- Happy to help.

745
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:30.125
The prodigal son has returned,
and bearing gifts.

746
00:40:31.583 --> 00:40:34.583
My God. You look like a snack.

747
00:40:35.750 --> 00:40:37.708
I could eat your dick
like corn on the cob.

748
00:40:47.375 --> 00:40:49.875
Is this Scarface's house? God dang.

749
00:40:53.875 --> 00:40:54.875
Okay.

750
00:40:57.750 --> 00:40:59.458
Ow! Come on!

751
00:41:01.458 --> 00:41:03.000
Okay.

752
00:41:03.083 --> 00:41:05.000
Now I know why rich people have these.

753
00:41:13.875 --> 00:41:15.458
Can we get on with this?

754
00:41:16.833 --> 00:41:19.875
See, I just don't see
any reason why we can't be civil.

755
00:41:19.958 --> 00:41:22.541
Besides, if anyone
has a right to be angry, it's me.

756
00:41:22.625 --> 00:41:25.833
I was the one who was betrayed, right?

757
00:41:43.250 --> 00:41:46.250
Oh! Oh, I am so sorry.
I'm so sorry, little buddy.

758
00:41:48.208 --> 00:41:50.416
No, no, no, no, no!

759
00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:55.166
There's just under a million in there.

760
00:41:57.041 --> 00:41:59.708
Bravo. Now you just owe me five more.

761
00:41:59.791 --> 00:42:01.375
Oh, God!

762
00:42:01.458 --> 00:42:03.458
Mini ones? What, are they cheaper?

763
00:42:03.541 --> 00:42:06.000
We took one million, not six.

764
00:42:06.083 --> 00:42:08.333
And have you forgotten how this works?

765
00:42:08.416 --> 00:42:11.000
While you were running, so was the vig.

766
00:42:12.125 --> 00:42:15.041
I'm sorry I kicked your friend!

767
00:42:19.750 --> 00:42:23.166
Oh, look at you little guys.
You guys are adorable from up here.

768
00:42:23.250 --> 00:42:25.708
If only you were a wee bit taller.

769
00:42:25.791 --> 00:42:28.791
Ow! Why?

770
00:42:29.833 --> 00:42:32.208
Five million's gonna
take us some time, Rehan.

771
00:42:32.291 --> 00:42:34.583
Do I look like an unreasonable woman?

772
00:42:34.666 --> 00:42:36.541
No. You have till end of week.

773
00:42:37.208 --> 00:42:41.833
I'm sorry. Does that interfere
with your daughter's wedding?

774
00:42:43.458 --> 00:42:44.458
Oh, shit!

775
00:42:44.541 --> 00:42:47.208
Are you surprised that I am aware
that you have a daughter?

776
00:42:47.291 --> 00:42:48.291
And she...

777
00:42:48.375 --> 00:42:50.958
Let's hypothetically call her,
I don't know, Parker?

778
00:42:51.041 --> 00:42:53.291
...is getting married on Saturday.

779
00:42:53.791 --> 00:42:54.916
If you don't get me

780
00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.250
my five million dollars
before the wedding, then Parker...

781
00:42:59.166 --> 00:43:01.666
is marrying the Grim Reaper.

782
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:07.416
- Meaning she'll be killed.
- Yeah, yeah, I get it. I get it.

783
00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.666
I know you got it, darling.

784
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:12.708
Did I mention I have a new shark tank?

785
00:43:12.791 --> 00:43:15.833
Maybe your daughter
could test it out for me.

786
00:43:17.666 --> 00:43:19.875
Those fuckers are hungry.

787
00:43:20.458 --> 00:43:22.166
Shh!

788
00:43:25.291 --> 00:43:27.083
Pick up, Parker!

789
00:43:27.166 --> 00:43:29.375
- Parker, pick up!
- Thank you for...

790
00:43:29.458 --> 00:43:30.625
Son of a...

791
00:43:30.708 --> 00:43:33.666
Oh, no! No, no, no, no, no!

792
00:43:34.291 --> 00:43:35.291
Oh, God!

793
00:43:36.458 --> 00:43:38.583
Okay.

794
00:43:41.375 --> 00:43:43.083
Hey, officer, how can I help you?

795
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:46.958
License and masturbation, please.

796
00:43:47.583 --> 00:43:50.291
- Okay, good morning.
- You look like shit.

797
00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.416
And that's coming from a guy

798
00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:54.791
who uses his sock
as a filter for his coffee.

799
00:43:54.875 --> 00:43:55.916
No, I'm doing great.

800
00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.500
- Thanks for asking.
- Mmm.

801
00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:00.666
There appears to be
a dog gnawing on your leg.

802
00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:06.416
Yeah, that's just my little buddy.
My little bud.

803
00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:08.708
We just took a walk in the woods.

804
00:44:08.791 --> 00:44:10.083
You know, it's funny,

805
00:44:10.875 --> 00:44:12.833
the Ghost Bandits knew precisely

806
00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:16.000
how to circumvent
the security system in your bank.

807
00:44:16.083 --> 00:44:19.750
And when I called SunRidge
to find out who designed the system,

808
00:44:20.916 --> 00:44:22.333
you know what they said?

809
00:44:23.333 --> 00:44:26.666
Are you insinuating
that I had something to do with it?

810
00:44:27.666 --> 00:44:29.083
Do you mind popping the trunk?

811
00:44:29.875 --> 00:44:31.541
- Pop the trunk.
- Okay, this is insane.

812
00:44:31.625 --> 00:44:34.208
I'll say that. I mean, this is ridiculous.

813
00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:36.500
I haven't committed a crime
in my entire life.

814
00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:38.125
Uh-huh.

815
00:44:38.208 --> 00:44:39.750
First time for everything!

816
00:44:40.541 --> 00:44:42.500
Let's see.

817
00:44:42.583 --> 00:44:44.375
We got a couple burner phones,

818
00:44:44.458 --> 00:44:46.833
two boxes of nine mil, and...

819
00:44:47.625 --> 00:44:49.625
...voice modulator.

820
00:44:49.708 --> 00:44:51.416
Someone put this stuff in my trunk.

821
00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:53.833
Who, Owen?
Who are you working with?

822
00:44:56.125 --> 00:44:57.958
- Who, Owen?
- I...

823
00:44:58.958 --> 00:45:00.416
I don't... I don't know.

824
00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:05.083
Okay, look, I get it.
I forget things too sometimes.

825
00:45:05.166 --> 00:45:10.416
So how about a nice, long weekend
in a jail cell to help jog your memory?

826
00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:12.625
I'm...
I'm supposed to get married this weekend.

827
00:45:12.708 --> 00:45:16.416
You know, I was married once,
to a beautiful woman named Sheryl.

828
00:45:17.625 --> 00:45:20.000
- You know where she is now?
- Is she dead?

829
00:45:21.041 --> 00:45:22.125
I wish.

830
00:45:22.833 --> 00:45:25.916
No, she lives in Key West
with her new husband.

831
00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:27.750
Former Navy SEAL.

832
00:45:27.833 --> 00:45:31.625
Rock-hard abs,
and a cock you can land a 747 on.

833
00:45:31.708 --> 00:45:32.958
That's a big plane.

834
00:45:33.041 --> 00:45:34.750
It's a wide plane.

835
00:45:35.583 --> 00:45:39.833
Anyway, I became so obsessed
with catching the Ghost Bandits

836
00:45:39.916 --> 00:45:42.125
that it cost me my marriage.

837
00:45:42.208 --> 00:45:43.208
Hmm?

838
00:45:43.541 --> 00:45:44.583
My house.

839
00:45:45.666 --> 00:45:47.125
Maybe even my sanity.

840
00:45:47.208 --> 00:45:50.458
I mean, after a while,
I started wondering if the Ghost Bandits...

841
00:45:51.541 --> 00:45:53.791
you know, were real ghosts.

842
00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.666
Hey! Let's funnel this energy
into getting Sheryl back!

843
00:46:00.416 --> 00:46:02.833
Right? I can make a photo montage.

844
00:46:02.916 --> 00:46:05.958
Don't let this guy
with this giant cock win over you!

845
00:46:06.041 --> 00:46:08.625
- Lock him up.
- Wait, no! My wedding!

846
00:46:08.708 --> 00:46:10.583
Oh, you're gonna have a wedding,

847
00:46:10.666 --> 00:46:13.875
and quite the bachelor party
in D block this weekend.

848
00:46:16.125 --> 00:46:17.125
It wasn't me.

849
00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.333
It was my in-laws.

850
00:46:21.416 --> 00:46:23.666
They robbed my bank,
and I did not help them.

851
00:46:23.750 --> 00:46:24.750
They used me.

852
00:46:25.166 --> 00:46:26.666
Damn, boy, you flip quick.

853
00:46:27.416 --> 00:46:30.250
Prove it.
Put on a wire and get 'em to confess.

854
00:46:30.833 --> 00:46:34.416
- You want me to be a rat?
- I want you to do the right thing, Owen.

855
00:46:35.208 --> 00:46:38.916
Clear your name,
and help me catch the Ghost Bandits.

856
00:46:40.125 --> 00:46:42.625
And also, yes, be a little bit of a rat.

857
00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.500
Parker.

858
00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:50.583
Parker! Hey, Parker!

859
00:46:51.333 --> 00:46:53.601
- There you are! Where you been?
- We have to talk.

860
00:46:53.625 --> 00:46:55.892
- Why are you pinching your chest?
- Because I'm wearing a...

861
00:46:55.916 --> 00:46:59.083
Whoa, gosh!
A... soft shirt! Whoa!

862
00:46:59.166 --> 00:47:01.291
Feels like my fingers are at a finger spa.

863
00:47:01.375 --> 00:47:03.375
- Really? Looks pretty starchy...
- Don't touch me!

864
00:47:05.333 --> 00:47:07.000
I'm sorry. It's just...

865
00:47:07.958 --> 00:47:10.916
the in-laws aren't supposed
to touch the groom before the wedding.

866
00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.166
- That's horseshit.
- Are you high right now, Owen?

867
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:15.500
I don't do illegal things,
unlike other people.

868
00:47:15.583 --> 00:47:18.666
Other people do... illegal things,
and I'm cool with that too.

869
00:47:18.750 --> 00:47:21.830
And if we want to talk about that
and just sort of get things off our chest...

870
00:47:21.875 --> 00:47:25.083
Okay, uh, we gotta go,
'cause we gotta be at the bakery.

871
00:47:26.083 --> 00:47:27.750
The bakery! Yep!

872
00:47:27.833 --> 00:47:30.041
Okay, I think me and you
should just go to the bakery,

873
00:47:30.125 --> 00:47:33.000
just because our baker died,
we gotta get a new cake.

874
00:47:33.083 --> 00:47:36.375
Perhaps we should all just go together.
One big happy family.

875
00:47:37.125 --> 00:47:39.000
You guys don't wanna run errands.

876
00:47:39.083 --> 00:47:40.000
I do.

877
00:47:40.083 --> 00:47:42.333
Of course we do.
Who doesn't like desserts?

878
00:47:42.416 --> 00:47:47.083
Well, they're vegan desserts,
and we all know that they taste like shit.

879
00:47:47.666 --> 00:47:50.125
I'm sorry, Parker,
but I'm being honest with you.

880
00:47:50.208 --> 00:47:52.583
They taste like shit, okay?

881
00:47:52.666 --> 00:47:56.000
So you guys should stay,
we should go eat the shit. Come on.

882
00:47:56.083 --> 00:47:57.750
As long as we leave now.

883
00:47:57.833 --> 00:48:01.000
Oh, we're all going. Cool, good.
All right! Okay!

884
00:48:01.083 --> 00:48:06.750
Okay! Oh, we're tasting cakes
at 1308 Grant Avenue!

885
00:48:06.833 --> 00:48:09.083
You know, when I go on a trip,
I usually take two bags.

886
00:48:09.166 --> 00:48:10.833
I have a carry-on, then I check one too.

887
00:48:10.916 --> 00:48:13.291
- I check one, two.
- Schmuck.

888
00:48:13.375 --> 00:48:16.541
You're driving!
Billy McDermott is driving! Cool.

889
00:48:18.416 --> 00:48:20.833
Hey, do you want to play
Never Have I Ever?

890
00:48:20.916 --> 00:48:24.000
Never have I ever worn
a scary mask when it wasn't Halloween.

891
00:48:24.083 --> 00:48:25.125
Now your turn.

892
00:48:26.916 --> 00:48:30.291
We have arrived.
I am one click south of the door.

893
00:48:30.375 --> 00:48:33.625
You guys sure you don't wanna wait
in the car? No? Okay.

894
00:48:33.708 --> 00:48:35.166
We are zero clicks from the door.

895
00:48:35.250 --> 00:48:37.458
I am opening the door.

896
00:48:37.541 --> 00:48:40.416
- Right this way, come on in.
- Go ahead. Smells good.

897
00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:42.958
Nice. Yep, that's cake.

898
00:48:43.041 --> 00:48:45.791
Welcome to Vegan Divas.
Where you can get your cake...

899
00:48:45.875 --> 00:48:49.083
And eat it too! I'm Kay.

900
00:48:49.166 --> 00:48:50.750
And this is my sister Ida.

901
00:48:50.833 --> 00:48:55.250
She's the vegan and I'm the diva.

902
00:48:56.416 --> 00:48:59.500
Thank you so much
for fitting us in last minute.

903
00:48:59.583 --> 00:49:01.041
- Yep.
- Don't even worry about it.

904
00:49:01.125 --> 00:49:04.416
I totally get last minute.
I'm never on time for anything.

905
00:49:04.500 --> 00:49:06.666
Are you sure about this?

906
00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:08.710
Our wedding
is at a very specific time.

907
00:49:08.750 --> 00:49:10.291
No, it's okay. The reviews were great.

908
00:49:10.375 --> 00:49:11.976
This is just their shtick.

909
00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Oh!

910
00:49:13.541 --> 00:49:15.125
Why do I keep doing that?

911
00:49:15.208 --> 00:49:16.848
Hey, I think you might be bleeding.

912
00:49:16.875 --> 00:49:18.267
- Ida!
- Okay, I'm sorry.

913
00:49:18.291 --> 00:49:20.125
- Cake! Hurry!
- Okay.

914
00:49:22.458 --> 00:49:25.416
So this is our Better-Than-Sex
red velvet cake

915
00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:27.041
that Ida makes from scratch.

916
00:49:27.125 --> 00:49:29.208
And that name is no lie.

917
00:49:29.291 --> 00:49:30.708
I've compared them both.

918
00:49:30.791 --> 00:49:32.125
Mmm! And this is vegan?

919
00:49:33.291 --> 00:49:34.166
Oh, yeah.

920
00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:35.250
Hmm.

921
00:49:35.833 --> 00:49:38.791
Parker, can I speak with you
in private real quick?

922
00:49:39.375 --> 00:49:40.375
What's wrong?

923
00:49:40.458 --> 00:49:42.125
- I like to concur...
- What? Sure.

924
00:49:42.208 --> 00:49:45.333
...about, you know, important life decisions
before we make them.

925
00:49:45.416 --> 00:49:47.208
- You know? Mmm-hmm.
- Really?

926
00:49:54.541 --> 00:49:56.976
- You have a little something here.
- What's that, sweetheart?

927
00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.833
What the fuck?

928
00:49:59.583 --> 00:50:02.416
I'm sorry!
I didn't know you guys were together!

929
00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.125
Owen, what's going on?

930
00:50:04.208 --> 00:50:07.750
Okay, I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but the FBI thinks

931
00:50:07.833 --> 00:50:10.041
- I had something to do with the robbery.
- What?

932
00:50:10.125 --> 00:50:11.476
They made me wear...

933
00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:13.875
Oh! What a lovely little bakery.

934
00:50:13.958 --> 00:50:16.333
- You must be Parker!
- Hi.

935
00:50:18.708 --> 00:50:22.166
- Ah! Nobody make a scene!
- You're the one with the gun, Rehan.

936
00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:25.708
Yes, you are the one with the gun
holding hostages right now...

937
00:50:25.791 --> 00:50:28.166
- ...inside of the bakery.
- Oh, hostages!

938
00:50:29.583 --> 00:50:32.083
- What the hell is going on?
- Listen, Rehan.

939
00:50:32.166 --> 00:50:34.875
- We told you we'd get you the money.
- Oh, yes. No, you did.

940
00:50:34.958 --> 00:50:36.708
But then I remembered you are liars.

941
00:50:36.791 --> 00:50:39.958
Just in case you were planning
on slithering away into the shadows again,

942
00:50:40.041 --> 00:50:41.916
I thought I'd come here for a little...

943
00:50:42.625 --> 00:50:44.666
insurance.

944
00:50:48.458 --> 00:50:51.875
- Come along, Parker.
- Hey, hey, hey! Just take me instead.

945
00:50:51.958 --> 00:50:52.958
Take me!

946
00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.916
You little Build-A-Bear?
You think you're hostage material?

947
00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.708
No one here gives two shits
whether you live or die!

948
00:50:58.791 --> 00:51:01.708
Look at them and check in with them.

949
00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.250
Oh! Zero shits given.

950
00:51:04.833 --> 00:51:07.166
I don't understand. Was Owen right?

951
00:51:07.250 --> 00:51:08.875
Just do what she says.

952
00:51:08.958 --> 00:51:11.958
Stay calm, baby. Just stay calm.

953
00:51:12.041 --> 00:51:15.166
So emo! Getting choked up.

954
00:51:15.250 --> 00:51:17.666
- Dad? Dad?
- I like getting choked, though.

955
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:20.041
You can eat my cake anytime!

956
00:51:20.125 --> 00:51:23.916
Please, God, save my fiancée who is
exiting the back of the bakery right now.

957
00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:25.958
FBI! Freeze!

958
00:51:26.041 --> 00:51:27.375
God'll save you, Parker!

959
00:51:35.666 --> 00:51:40.041
Please!
God, please! Please! Please, God!

960
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:48.458
Ahh! Oh! Oh, shit!

961
00:51:53.208 --> 00:51:56.958
Come on, Roger! You got this, Roger!
Be a man, you dickhead!

962
00:52:02.791 --> 00:52:04.458
Ahh! Ahh!

963
00:52:31.541 --> 00:52:33.791
God, man!

964
00:52:35.458 --> 00:52:37.666
- Fuck you!
- Go on, take her!

965
00:52:37.750 --> 00:52:39.458
Get the fuck in! Get in the car!

966
00:52:43.291 --> 00:52:44.625
I'm going after her.

967
00:52:44.708 --> 00:52:47.083
What the fuck? Oh, son of a bitch.

968
00:52:48.791 --> 00:52:50.375
Everything's fucking cake in here!

969
00:52:51.166 --> 00:52:52.375
I'm going after her!

970
00:52:52.458 --> 00:52:55.041
No! You're gonna get yourself killed!
Get down! Get down!

971
00:53:01.208 --> 00:53:03.166
You're really fuckin' getting on my tits!

972
00:53:07.041 --> 00:53:09.166
Shut up!

973
00:53:11.666 --> 00:53:13.833
Lilly! Lilly, the front!

974
00:53:13.916 --> 00:53:14.750
Let's go.

975
00:53:21.666 --> 00:53:22.750
Go for the tires.

976
00:53:23.291 --> 00:53:24.958
Get me my fucking money!

977
00:53:25.958 --> 00:53:27.166
Ah, shit.

978
00:53:27.250 --> 00:53:29.208
I fucking love this job!

979
00:53:29.791 --> 00:53:31.583
Motherfuckers!

980
00:53:31.666 --> 00:53:32.666
Freeze!

981
00:53:33.625 --> 00:53:34.458
What?

982
00:53:34.541 --> 00:53:35.875
Put your guns down.

983
00:53:35.958 --> 00:53:37.000
Put 'em down now.

984
00:53:38.666 --> 00:53:40.500
- They got our daughter.
- Don't move!

985
00:53:49.791 --> 00:53:52.333
Motherfucker!

986
00:53:53.375 --> 00:53:56.166
You! You were supposed to protect her!

987
00:53:56.250 --> 00:53:58.583
This is why people
don't trust the federal government.

988
00:53:58.666 --> 00:54:00.625
This is on you! Hey! Hey!

989
00:54:00.708 --> 00:54:02.625
Let me in! Hey, let me in!

990
00:54:03.208 --> 00:54:04.625
No, no, no, no, no!

991
00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:05.916
Let me in! Let me in!

992
00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.541
Okay, I committed.

993
00:54:22.333 --> 00:54:23.333
What happened?

994
00:54:24.291 --> 00:54:25.833
Ahh!

995
00:54:26.833 --> 00:54:28.541
- Oh, Jesus.
- Ow!

996
00:54:28.625 --> 00:54:31.541
Come on, get your ass out here.
There you go.

997
00:54:31.625 --> 00:54:34.583
Ahh! Why are we stopped?
We gotta go after her!

998
00:54:35.166 --> 00:54:37.958
- I know where that woman lives!
- Rehan has houses everywhere.

999
00:54:38.041 --> 00:54:39.625
We have no idea where she took Parker.

1000
00:54:39.708 --> 00:54:41.666
Even if you did,
what were you gonna do?

1001
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:42.916
Sneak into the bushes

1002
00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.375
and get chased up a tree
by a pack of tiny dogs?

1003
00:54:45.458 --> 00:54:47.500
Parker is in the wind.

1004
00:54:48.125 --> 00:54:50.291
- I'm sorry.
- Well, what are we gonna do now?

1005
00:54:50.375 --> 00:54:53.416
The first thing we're gonna do is
you're gonna take that fucking wire off.

1006
00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.708
You little shit bag.

1007
00:54:54.791 --> 00:54:57.541
I knew you were a coward
but I didn't take you to be a rat.

1008
00:54:57.625 --> 00:55:00.041
Oh, I'm sorry, but I'm not
gonna take the fall for you guys!

1009
00:55:00.125 --> 00:55:01.541
We never asked you to.

1010
00:55:01.625 --> 00:55:03.750
No! You just framed me!

1011
00:55:03.833 --> 00:55:06.833
You put bank-robbing evidence
in the trunk of my car!

1012
00:55:08.125 --> 00:55:09.845
He wouldn't have
been convicted of anything!

1013
00:55:09.875 --> 00:55:11.583
It was just enough to tie him up

1014
00:55:11.666 --> 00:55:14.750
and save Parker from making
the biggest mistake of her life.

1015
00:55:15.333 --> 00:55:18.666
She just got kidnapped
because of you!

1016
00:55:19.791 --> 00:55:23.125
Before you came back in her life,
the worst thing that happened to Parker?

1017
00:55:23.625 --> 00:55:26.166
She burned the roof of her mouth
on a home-made flatbread.

1018
00:55:26.250 --> 00:55:29.291
I would've blown on it, but I couldn't.
I had a cold.

1019
00:55:29.375 --> 00:55:33.333
How could you guys
possibly know what she wants?

1020
00:55:33.416 --> 00:55:35.208
Or needs? You weren't there!

1021
00:55:35.291 --> 00:55:38.125
Because we were trying
to fucking protect her, that's why!

1022
00:55:38.208 --> 00:55:39.625
Rehan used to be our partner.

1023
00:55:39.708 --> 00:55:41.508
She would choose the bank
and clean the money.

1024
00:55:41.541 --> 00:55:43.333
And then she started to fuckin' lose it!

1025
00:55:43.416 --> 00:55:46.041
We were afraid
she would find out about Parker.

1026
00:55:46.125 --> 00:55:48.750
So on the last job,
we just took the money and ran.

1027
00:55:48.833 --> 00:55:51.166
I don't give a shit.
I don't care what happened, okay?

1028
00:55:51.666 --> 00:55:54.583
- I just care about getting Parker back.
- Oh, yeah, you and me both.

1029
00:55:57.083 --> 00:56:01.291
You need five million in two days.
So you're gonna rob another bank, right?

1030
00:56:02.583 --> 00:56:04.708
Wouldn't hurt to have
a bank manager on the team.

1031
00:56:06.375 --> 00:56:10.500
Someone who knows the bank's weaknesses,
which ones have excess cash holdings,

1032
00:56:10.583 --> 00:56:12.500
when and where they move that cash.

1033
00:56:13.041 --> 00:56:15.916
He gets nervous cracking an egg.
You think he can rob a bank?

1034
00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.541
If it's to save Parker?
Fuck yeah, I'll rob a bank!

1035
00:56:24.583 --> 00:56:26.625
We always knew they were criminals.

1036
00:56:27.208 --> 00:56:29.083
They drink during the day.

1037
00:56:29.166 --> 00:56:33.416
Yeah. Yeah. Hey, and the daughter...
is a yoga instructor.

1038
00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:36.333
I'm not saying anything,
but, you know, connect the dots.

1039
00:56:36.416 --> 00:56:37.416
Mmm.

1040
00:56:38.375 --> 00:56:40.250
Do you have any idea
where they might've gone?

1041
00:56:40.333 --> 00:56:41.333
Mmm-mmm.

1042
00:56:41.416 --> 00:56:45.041
Does Owen have any access
to a family cabin or anything like that?

1043
00:56:45.125 --> 00:56:47.000
A, um, a vacation home...

1044
00:56:47.083 --> 00:56:49.375
Vacation home? What, are you kidding me?

1045
00:56:49.875 --> 00:56:51.833
Who do we look like, The Jeffersons?

1046
00:56:54.791 --> 00:56:57.666
Here's a list of all the banks
within a 100-mile radius,

1047
00:56:57.750 --> 00:57:02.041
arranged by on-site cash holdings,
from ValueBank all the way up to...

1048
00:57:02.125 --> 00:57:04.500
Atlas Reserve, 20 million dollars.

1049
00:57:04.583 --> 00:57:06.833
- One-stop shopping.
- Hmm! Easy.

1050
00:57:06.916 --> 00:57:08.458
Yeah, I wish!

1051
00:57:08.541 --> 00:57:09.375
- No?
- No.

1052
00:57:09.458 --> 00:57:11.083
We can't rob Atlas Reserve.

1053
00:57:11.166 --> 00:57:13.541
Phoebe King has that place on lock.

1054
00:57:13.625 --> 00:57:14.708
Who's Phoebe King?

1055
00:57:14.791 --> 00:57:18.250
I thought you guys were the Ghost Bandits.
You don't know who Phoebe King is?

1056
00:57:18.958 --> 00:57:22.166
She pioneered bandit barriers.

1057
00:57:22.833 --> 00:57:25.416
Every inch of her bank
is triple secured.

1058
00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:26.833
I'd fuck me.

1059
00:57:26.916 --> 00:57:28.083
And her vault?

1060
00:57:28.166 --> 00:57:31.500
I'm talking biometrics,
weight sensitivity,

1061
00:57:31.583 --> 00:57:34.166
not to mention randomized time locks!

1062
00:57:34.250 --> 00:57:35.583
Okay?

1063
00:57:36.375 --> 00:57:37.541
When did you make this?

1064
00:57:38.041 --> 00:57:40.226
When I walked to the vending machine,
got a Diet Squirt.

1065
00:57:40.250 --> 00:57:42.041
Weirdly, I had a lot of it in my pockets.

1066
00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:43.285
So, let me get this straight.

1067
00:57:43.333 --> 00:57:45.458
You made a model
of a bank we're not gonna rob?

1068
00:57:47.333 --> 00:57:49.541
Oh, wow. There's another one.
He made two.

1069
00:57:49.625 --> 00:57:51.625
I made 12. Only two are presentable.

1070
00:57:51.708 --> 00:57:53.375
See, we don't want a Phoebe King.

1071
00:57:53.458 --> 00:57:57.000
What we need is Victory Union,
a bank whose manager is lazy.

1072
00:57:57.875 --> 00:57:59.125
A total turd.

1073
00:57:59.666 --> 00:58:03.583
What we need is a Vince Millen.

1074
00:58:04.250 --> 00:58:06.583
Vince lost his right testicle because,
one time,

1075
00:58:06.666 --> 00:58:08.875
he sat on his nuts too hard.

1076
00:58:10.416 --> 00:58:12.892
The reason he got hired
is 'cause his dad owns the bank.

1077
00:58:12.916 --> 00:58:13.916
Okay.

1078
00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.666
The most important thing
about Vince is that he cuts corners.

1079
00:58:18.750 --> 00:58:20.083
Federal regulations limit

1080
00:58:20.166 --> 00:58:23.208
how much cash a branch can hold
for security and insurance purposes.

1081
00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:24.750
When you go over the limit,

1082
00:58:24.833 --> 00:58:27.625
a manager has to arrange
for a cash pick-up from the vault.

1083
00:58:27.708 --> 00:58:29.458
Yo, lock up for me.
I got paintball.

1084
00:58:30.375 --> 00:58:34.541
Now, the armored truck is supposed to
take the cash directly to the repository,

1085
00:58:34.625 --> 00:58:36.666
but Vince hates paperwork.

1086
00:58:38.083 --> 00:58:40.166
So he has the same armored truck

1087
00:58:40.250 --> 00:58:42.875
collect cash
from all three branches he manages

1088
00:58:42.958 --> 00:58:45.208
before going to the repository.

1089
00:58:45.291 --> 00:58:48.958
So if we hit that truck
after the pickup from the third branch...

1090
00:58:49.041 --> 00:58:51.625
It's like robbing three banks in one.

1091
00:58:51.708 --> 00:58:53.541
- We just need disguises.
- Yep.

1092
00:58:53.625 --> 00:58:54.708
And I need a gun.

1093
00:58:56.041 --> 00:58:57.875
- What? Oh, my gosh.
- Mmm-hmm.

1094
00:58:57.958 --> 00:58:59.583
Whoa!

1095
00:59:00.666 --> 00:59:03.833
- It's way lighter than I thought it'd be.
- It's a water gun.

1096
00:59:05.458 --> 00:59:06.583
- Is it?
- Mmm-hmm.

1097
00:59:07.666 --> 00:59:08.916
Do I still look cool?

1098
00:59:09.833 --> 00:59:11.875
Yeah, you look like James Bond.

1099
00:59:11.958 --> 00:59:13.000
Which one?

1100
00:59:13.083 --> 00:59:15.083
- Five.
- Oh, that was a good one.

1101
01:00:11.291 --> 01:00:12.958
Everybody on the ground, now!

1102
01:00:13.041 --> 01:00:14.625
Don't be a hero!

1103
01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.000
Hey, Donkey!

1104
01:00:23.833 --> 01:00:26.291
Oh, God! That was really violent!

1105
01:00:26.916 --> 01:00:29.458
How'd you like my accent?
Did it sound Irish or Scottish?

1106
01:00:29.541 --> 01:00:32.166
It was supposed to sound Scottish
but I think it came out Irish.

1107
01:00:32.250 --> 01:00:33.250
Don't tell Billy.

1108
01:00:33.291 --> 01:00:35.250
Focus! We're robbing a bank here.

1109
01:00:35.333 --> 01:00:38.625
And remember, you're in charge.

1110
01:00:42.166 --> 01:00:44.208
That's right! I'm in charge, okay?

1111
01:00:44.291 --> 01:00:45.958
So no one try to be a hero.

1112
01:00:47.166 --> 01:00:49.000
I will cap a motherfucker!

1113
01:00:49.083 --> 01:00:50.916
I will cap your ass!

1114
01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:05.000
Everybody, stay down, all right?

1115
01:01:05.083 --> 01:01:07.791
You guys like Shrek?
Who's your favorite character?

1116
01:01:07.875 --> 01:01:09.125
Mine's Shrek.

1117
01:01:10.666 --> 01:01:13.041
What are you doing? Don't get up.
Do not get up!

1118
01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:16.208
Okay, and you did.
But stay right there, all right?

1119
01:01:16.291 --> 01:01:20.083
Do not come towards me.
Do not come tow... Don't rush towards me!

1120
01:01:24.833 --> 01:01:26.000
Easy breezy.

1121
01:01:32.291 --> 01:01:33.291
Ahh!

1122
01:01:43.166 --> 01:01:44.375
What the fuck?

1123
01:01:47.375 --> 01:01:48.583
Freeze!

1124
01:01:48.666 --> 01:01:51.083
Nice and easy, boy-o. I gotcha.

1125
01:01:55.708 --> 01:01:57.666
Put the gun down. Put it down.

1126
01:01:57.750 --> 01:01:59.000
That's very good.

1127
01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:14.625
Lilly! I got this, get the money!

1128
01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:42.750
Billy!

1129
01:02:48.875 --> 01:02:51.583
Come on, kid,
where the fuck are you?

1130
01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:08.750
About time, Shrek.

1131
01:03:08.833 --> 01:03:11.708
Sorry, a big guy that looked like
Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's character

1132
01:03:11.791 --> 01:03:14.791
from Moana had a heart attack,
so I had to give him CPR.

1133
01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:15.958
How's your part going?

1134
01:03:16.041 --> 01:03:18.875
- Three against two. Drop 'em.
- What do we do?

1135
01:03:18.958 --> 01:03:20.625
- I don't know.
- You drop 'em.

1136
01:03:26.791 --> 01:03:29.916
- Can we hurry up?
- Can we hurry this up?

1137
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.500
Okay, all right, just put 'em down.

1138
01:03:33.416 --> 01:03:34.583
Easy down now.

1139
01:03:38.166 --> 01:03:39.500
What the fuck?

1140
01:03:40.708 --> 01:03:42.333
- Oh, shit.
- Son of a bitch!

1141
01:03:45.833 --> 01:03:46.916
Oh! Oh, God!

1142
01:03:50.833 --> 01:03:52.166
That boy's a real dumbass.

1143
01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:58.916
- Fuck, there goes our getaway.
- Okay.

1144
01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:12.041
Get in!

1145
01:04:12.125 --> 01:04:13.666
Go! Go, go, go!

1146
01:04:14.875 --> 01:04:16.916
All right, yeah! We're doing this.

1147
01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.166
Shut up and drive!

1148
01:04:18.250 --> 01:04:19.666
Okay, yeah, let's go.

1149
01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.500
You know, I always wanted
to be a school bus driver.

1150
01:04:33.666 --> 01:04:34.666
The money!

1151
01:04:34.750 --> 01:04:36.625
The money, the money!

1152
01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:40.416
Oh, no, no, no. That's not good.

1153
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.916
I'm gonna
kick your green ass, Shrek!

1154
01:04:48.875 --> 01:04:50.625
I thought we defunded the police.

1155
01:04:58.666 --> 01:05:00.625
Pull over now!

1156
01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:05.541
I'm sorry!

1157
01:05:05.625 --> 01:05:06.625
Yep, now they're angry.

1158
01:05:13.166 --> 01:05:14.291
Oh, God!

1159
01:05:20.083 --> 01:05:22.000
He'll be fine, it's fine.

1160
01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:33.666
Where the fuck is he going?

1161
01:05:41.250 --> 01:05:43.375
Oh, my God!

1162
01:05:48.750 --> 01:05:51.041
Lord forgive us, Mary and Joseph!

1163
01:05:59.833 --> 01:06:03.041
...to light, as our hearts
mourn during this time...

1164
01:06:08.041 --> 01:06:10.000
Goal!

1165
01:06:10.083 --> 01:06:11.833
Have you no dignity?

1166
01:06:26.458 --> 01:06:27.875
Ho-ho-ho!

1167
01:06:27.958 --> 01:06:30.416
Pretty sure my great-grandma
was buried in here.

1168
01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:32.375
Shut the fuck up!

1169
01:06:32.458 --> 01:06:33.458
Okay.

1170
01:06:34.583 --> 01:06:35.833
Oh, shit.

1171
01:06:37.625 --> 01:06:39.291
Why?

1172
01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:46.125
Oh, shit!

1173
01:06:46.208 --> 01:06:47.642
- God.
- What the fuck is that?

1174
01:06:47.666 --> 01:06:51.250
My Go-Gurts! Snack time.
Gotta keep the blood sugar up.

1175
01:06:51.333 --> 01:06:53.309
- Give me that.
- You want to pick a flavor?

1176
01:06:53.333 --> 01:06:55.458
- Fucking Go-Gurts!
- Snack time!

1177
01:06:56.583 --> 01:06:58.541
Shit!

1178
01:07:07.541 --> 01:07:08.708
Oh, shit.

1179
01:07:13.916 --> 01:07:15.208
How much did we clear?

1180
01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:19.500
Sixty bucks.

1181
01:07:21.875 --> 01:07:23.083
Sixty bucks.

1182
01:07:23.166 --> 01:07:25.583
Okay, that's a building block.

1183
01:07:42.583 --> 01:07:44.625
I'm sorry. What the fuck is this?

1184
01:07:45.708 --> 01:07:47.958
You don't know him? This is Babayan.

1185
01:07:48.041 --> 01:07:52.000
He's like the Kanye
of the former Soviet Bloc.

1186
01:07:52.083 --> 01:07:53.083
Is the Kanye here?

1187
01:07:53.125 --> 01:07:55.458
Shut the fuck up and dance!

1188
01:07:57.666 --> 01:07:59.833
Do my parents rob banks?

1189
01:07:59.916 --> 01:08:01.458
Do I have a magical pussy?

1190
01:08:02.125 --> 01:08:03.541
The answer is yes.

1191
01:08:03.625 --> 01:08:07.166
Your parents,
they are magnificent bank robbers.

1192
01:08:07.250 --> 01:08:09.833
I mean, when they disappeared, I felt...

1193
01:08:10.666 --> 01:08:11.666
betrayed.

1194
01:08:13.125 --> 01:08:14.291
You try to run?

1195
01:08:15.208 --> 01:08:16.041
Ahh!

1196
01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:17.458
Stupid bitch.

1197
01:08:17.541 --> 01:08:18.958
Now, pay attention.

1198
01:08:19.041 --> 01:08:22.250
Babayan is about to do his grand finale.

1199
01:08:22.333 --> 01:08:25.208
Hoorah, Babayan!

1200
01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:27.916
Hoorah, Babayan!

1201
01:08:37.458 --> 01:08:39.250
I think I left my phone in there.

1202
01:08:39.333 --> 01:08:41.458
Okay, guess Uber's out of the question.

1203
01:08:42.666 --> 01:08:44.166
CPR?

1204
01:08:44.250 --> 01:08:48.000
You stopped to give someone CPR?

1205
01:08:48.083 --> 01:08:51.000
- My training kicked in.
- You foolish gobshite!

1206
01:08:51.083 --> 01:08:55.125
Okay, stop it! We have less
than 24 hours to get that money.

1207
01:08:55.208 --> 01:08:56.958
Oh, forget about the money.

1208
01:08:57.041 --> 01:08:59.708
We need to rescue Parker first,
then leave the country.

1209
01:08:59.791 --> 01:09:02.125
We are not running this time.

1210
01:09:02.208 --> 01:09:04.458
Parker made a real life for herself here.

1211
01:09:04.541 --> 01:09:07.750
- It's what's best for her.
- No, that's what's best for us.

1212
01:09:11.666 --> 01:09:12.875
I... I have an idea.

1213
01:09:15.625 --> 01:09:17.083
We could rob Atlas Reserve.

1214
01:09:17.166 --> 01:09:20.791
What happened to,
"One does not rob Phoebe King?"

1215
01:09:21.750 --> 01:09:24.625
One doesn't, but maybe three does?

1216
01:09:25.583 --> 01:09:27.750
I don't know. I just... I know a way in.

1217
01:09:27.833 --> 01:09:30.875
I just don't know we could get out
once the police show up.

1218
01:09:30.958 --> 01:09:33.458
Well, maybe we can
get a little help there.

1219
01:09:36.458 --> 01:09:38.166
Ghost Bandits on three.

1220
01:09:38.250 --> 01:09:39.250
Three...

1221
01:09:40.916 --> 01:09:43.416
Okay, that was gonna be a cool moment.
Hey, guys, wait up!

1222
01:09:43.500 --> 01:09:48.958
Earlier today, a man dressed
as the popular animated character Shrek

1223
01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:53.625
attempted to rob Victory Union Bank,
but he soon discovered that it's not so...

1224
01:09:53.708 --> 01:09:58.125
That's 100% Owen in a Shrek costume.
I could recognize his giant ass anywhere.

1225
01:09:58.208 --> 01:10:00.125
- No, it's not.
- It's not.

1226
01:10:00.208 --> 01:10:01.375
Damn, he's going nuts.

1227
01:10:01.458 --> 01:10:03.041
Why is he on TV?

1228
01:10:03.125 --> 01:10:04.625
I'm gonna call him again.

1229
01:10:06.916 --> 01:10:08.541
- Hello?
- It's Billy.

1230
01:10:08.625 --> 01:10:09.708
Oh, it's Billy.

1231
01:10:10.416 --> 01:10:11.708
- Okay...
- You listen to me.

1232
01:10:11.791 --> 01:10:14.541
You touch one single hair
on my son's back, and I swear to God...

1233
01:10:14.625 --> 01:10:17.458
Shut up and listen,
I'm not gonna touch your son's back hair.

1234
01:10:17.541 --> 01:10:19.541
But I am gonna use him to rob a bank.

1235
01:10:19.625 --> 01:10:23.166
If you don't want to see him go to prison,
we're gonna need getaway drivers.

1236
01:10:23.250 --> 01:10:26.708
Wait, hold on!
You want us to be getaway drivers?

1237
01:10:26.791 --> 01:10:29.375
So be at Owen's bank tomorrow, 10:00 a.m.

1238
01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:32.791
- And keep the engine running!
- Let me talk! Let me talk!

1239
01:10:32.875 --> 01:10:36.083
Mom? Dad?
I'm so scared! I'm so scared! Please...

1240
01:10:36.166 --> 01:10:37.958
Please, if you love me at all,

1241
01:10:38.041 --> 01:10:40.791
don't tell Agent Oldham
at the FBI anything.

1242
01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:42.625
Honey, I swear.

1243
01:10:42.708 --> 01:10:44.416
We will tell no one!

1244
01:10:44.916 --> 01:10:46.041
No one!

1245
01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:52.750
- What time did they say?
- 10:00 a.m.

1246
01:10:55.583 --> 01:10:57.333
Why does your clock say 8:00?

1247
01:10:58.125 --> 01:11:01.500
Oh, I took a business trip
to Phoenix once, I never changed it back.

1248
01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.166
Something's not right here.

1249
01:11:11.166 --> 01:11:13.166
Good. Coast is clear.

1250
01:11:13.916 --> 01:11:16.375
Told you they wouldn't
be an accessory to a crime.

1251
01:11:16.458 --> 01:11:18.333
Owen, you better take this.

1252
01:11:20.666 --> 01:11:22.416
Whoa, heft.

1253
01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:24.833
That's not tap water. It's lead.

1254
01:11:24.916 --> 01:11:27.208
Do not under any circumstances...

1255
01:11:27.291 --> 01:11:28.291
Oh, Jesus.

1256
01:11:28.333 --> 01:11:30.208
Do not pull the trigger.

1257
01:11:33.833 --> 01:11:36.250
All right. Game time.

1258
01:11:37.416 --> 01:11:38.791
Await my signal.

1259
01:11:42.416 --> 01:11:45.500
Just think of how many
terrible decisions we had to make

1260
01:11:45.583 --> 01:11:47.250
to get to this moment in time,

1261
01:11:47.333 --> 01:11:50.291
with everything riding
on this pasty little goober.

1262
01:11:52.291 --> 01:11:53.416
We're so fucked.

1263
01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:55.416
Yeah, well, this pasty little goober

1264
01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.458
is about to rob his second bank
for our daughter.

1265
01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000
I like him.

1266
01:12:03.208 --> 01:12:05.333
I'm sorry,
but I don't know what I'm doing.

1267
01:12:05.416 --> 01:12:08.416
My bank got robbed
and I didn't do anything to stop it.

1268
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:11.208
I suck! I suck so bad!

1269
01:12:11.291 --> 01:12:12.666
First off, stop crying.

1270
01:12:13.333 --> 01:12:15.500
Whenever I hear babies cry, I lactate.

1271
01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:17.875
Can't ruin another suit.

1272
01:12:17.958 --> 01:12:19.333
Look, I need your help.

1273
01:12:20.291 --> 01:12:23.392
Can you show me your vault so I can see
what a real security system looks like?

1274
01:12:23.416 --> 01:12:25.958
- So you want to see inside my vault?
- Yeah.

1275
01:12:26.041 --> 01:12:29.083
Remember when I told you a Butterball
turkey could break into your vault?

1276
01:12:29.666 --> 01:12:31.375
- Yeah, I remember.
- Make that sound.

1277
01:12:32.583 --> 01:12:35.125
If I do, would you let me into the vault?

1278
01:12:35.208 --> 01:12:37.291
Do it!
Come on!

1279
01:12:38.833 --> 01:12:40.392
With your throat.

1280
01:12:40.416 --> 01:12:42.666
Louder.

1281
01:12:42.750 --> 01:12:45.291
There you go.

1282
01:12:50.458 --> 01:12:51.458
Let's go.

1283
01:12:57.333 --> 01:12:58.333
Wow!

1284
01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:02.041
- Pretty heavy duty.
- Yeah, you like that, huh?

1285
01:13:02.125 --> 01:13:04.083
It's a decoy!

1286
01:13:04.166 --> 01:13:07.125
I'm not gonna have a safe this pathetic.
What am I, you?

1287
01:13:07.708 --> 01:13:11.708
"I'll just put one big circle
on the front and that's what locks it."

1288
01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:12.791
Freak.

1289
01:13:14.458 --> 01:13:16.041
- Don't look.
- Okay.

1290
01:13:19.583 --> 01:13:22.166
The last numbers are irrelevant.
That's how I masturbate.

1291
01:13:27.583 --> 01:13:28.916
That feels good.

1292
01:13:41.625 --> 01:13:43.083
Phoebe King.

1293
01:13:43.916 --> 01:13:45.208
You know it, bitch.

1294
01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:50.458
Is that...

1295
01:13:50.500 --> 01:13:54.583
Triple-enforced titanium with digital,
manual, and combination locks?

1296
01:13:57.250 --> 01:13:58.250
Pussy.

1297
01:13:59.125 --> 01:14:01.000
Don't tell me
when I can take a fuckin' break.

1298
01:14:01.083 --> 01:14:02.833
I take a break
when I fuckin' feel like it.

1299
01:14:02.916 --> 01:14:06.208
Shit! You know what I mean?
I don't care if it ain't...

1300
01:14:08.083 --> 01:14:11.625
That Owen's parents?
The fuck are they doing at the job?

1301
01:14:11.708 --> 01:14:14.458
Mr. and Mrs. Browning!
What's going on with y'all?

1302
01:14:14.541 --> 01:14:16.000
How y'all doing?

1303
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:19.416
Why y'all look like that?
Y'all look real stiff and kinda paranoid.

1304
01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:22.458
Real statuesque, like you...
you in a wax museum or something.

1305
01:14:24.583 --> 01:14:27.101
- Hey, is that a cop in your backseat?
- I'm not a cop.

1306
01:14:27.125 --> 01:14:30.500
I'm an agent.
And could you please keep your voice down?

1307
01:14:30.583 --> 01:14:32.708
First of all,
what's the fuckin' difference, okay?

1308
01:14:32.791 --> 01:14:35.125
You don't run nothing here!
This ain't your jurisdiction!

1309
01:14:35.208 --> 01:14:37.500
- Tyree! Tyree! Shh!
- What?

1310
01:14:37.583 --> 01:14:40.583
Don't tell anybody,
but your bank's about to be robbed.

1311
01:14:40.666 --> 01:14:43.541
What do you mean, don't tell nobody?
They about to rob the bank again?

1312
01:14:43.625 --> 01:14:45.105
- Shh!
- What the fuck, man?

1313
01:14:45.166 --> 01:14:48.125
Damn it! Man, I haven't even...
I left some shit in the microwave!

1314
01:14:48.208 --> 01:14:50.166
- Shh!
- Fuck! I haven't even taken my lunch yet!

1315
01:14:50.250 --> 01:14:51.416
No, you don't shush me!

1316
01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:53.125
- Fuck this! I'm out.
- Ugh!

1317
01:14:53.208 --> 01:14:56.125
- Fuck! The fuck...
- Why did you say that?

1318
01:14:56.208 --> 01:15:00.041
- I told you not to say anything.
- This job fucking sucks!

1319
01:15:00.125 --> 01:15:02.750
Just like Owen
told you not to say anything.

1320
01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:08.208
It's a setup! It's a setup!
They're going after a different bank!

1321
01:15:11.375 --> 01:15:14.125
- Get out, I'm taking the car.
- Not a chance.

1322
01:15:14.208 --> 01:15:17.208
It's taken me years
to get this seat exactly the way I like.

1323
01:15:17.291 --> 01:15:18.458
Oh, God!

1324
01:15:20.208 --> 01:15:21.583
God damn it!

1325
01:15:22.375 --> 01:15:24.833
- Where to?
- Atlas Reserve! They're desperate.

1326
01:15:24.916 --> 01:15:27.583
Come on! Come on!

1327
01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:32.333
Little faster, please?

1328
01:15:36.875 --> 01:15:38.625
And now for the money shot.

1329
01:15:39.416 --> 01:15:42.083
Synchronized manual locks.

1330
01:15:42.583 --> 01:15:45.041
Ah! Ah! Tss! Oh!

1331
01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000
Yeah.

1332
01:15:54.791 --> 01:15:57.625
It's not the most discreet signal.

1333
01:15:58.125 --> 01:16:01.250
Jesus, Owen, we got it.

1334
01:16:01.333 --> 01:16:04.166
Shut the fuck up! If this kid
makes it out alive, I'm gonna kill him.

1335
01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:06.010
Fuckin' hell!

1336
01:16:06.083 --> 01:16:09.875
Three, two, one, and release.

1337
01:16:29.666 --> 01:16:31.208
Pull.

1338
01:16:42.666 --> 01:16:44.000
This is a robbery!

1339
01:16:44.083 --> 01:16:46.333
Everyone on the ground now!

1340
01:16:46.958 --> 01:16:48.666
What the fuck is that? Oop!

1341
01:16:48.750 --> 01:16:50.250
I'm sorry! I'm a coward!

1342
01:16:50.333 --> 01:16:54.708
I suck at bank managing!
I can't believe I pulled it off.

1343
01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:56.791
Owen, you fucking coward!

1344
01:16:59.291 --> 01:17:01.000
Great, now I'm lactating.

1345
01:17:03.166 --> 01:17:04.625
Yes! Yes!

1346
01:17:20.875 --> 01:17:22.083
I'm coming for you, Parker.

1347
01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.500
Nope! That didn't go as planned.

1348
01:17:36.291 --> 01:17:37.458
Oh, my God.

1349
01:17:39.833 --> 01:17:40.875
Oh, my God.

1350
01:17:43.083 --> 01:17:45.750
- No! No!
- Come on, sunshine, out you get.

1351
01:17:45.833 --> 01:17:48.833
All units, we received
an alarm from Atlas Reserve Bank.

1352
01:17:48.875 --> 01:17:51.416
- Robbery in progress.
- I knew it. Let's go, Neil, faster.

1353
01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.750
- I drive smart, I don't drive fast.
- At least do the speed limit!

1354
01:17:54.833 --> 01:17:56.666
Your son's life depends on it!

1355
01:17:56.750 --> 01:17:58.833
- Faster!
- All right! All right, here goes!

1356
01:17:58.916 --> 01:18:00.291
With your permission?

1357
01:18:08.416 --> 01:18:11.500
You're kind of reminding me
of Dan Marino right now.

1358
01:18:12.041 --> 01:18:13.041
Dan Marino?

1359
01:18:13.833 --> 01:18:15.625
I met him at an orgy once.

1360
01:18:15.708 --> 01:18:18.625
Ha! You think his arm was big? Whoa!

1361
01:18:18.708 --> 01:18:21.291
I wouldn't know. I was in the car.

1362
01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:27.541
All right, emergency escape latch.
Every vault has one.

1363
01:18:31.416 --> 01:18:33.083
How can Gary never find this?

1364
01:18:45.708 --> 01:18:49.416
Hey, cuz, did somebody
order a bank robbery getaway driver?

1365
01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:52.416
Yo! Hey, what up?

1366
01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.125
- How'd the robbery go?
- Shut up!

1367
01:18:54.208 --> 01:18:57.875
Yo, man, I got morphine in the back
if you want to do a little drip...

1368
01:18:57.958 --> 01:19:00.166
- Let's go, come on!
- Yeah, let's go!

1369
01:19:00.250 --> 01:19:02.166
- Drive!
- Yeah, of course.

1370
01:19:20.083 --> 01:19:22.791
- Was that them?
- Get out! Get in the back, I'm driving!

1371
01:19:22.875 --> 01:19:24.458
You know what? I get sick in the back.

1372
01:19:24.541 --> 01:19:26.291
Margie,
would you mind gettin' in the back?

1373
01:19:26.375 --> 01:19:28.625
No! I don't want to get in the back.
It smells like eggs.

1374
01:19:28.708 --> 01:19:30.000
Come on, let's go!

1375
01:19:30.083 --> 01:19:31.750
- All right!
- Okay, I'm going.

1376
01:19:31.833 --> 01:19:34.666
- Fine. All right.
- Here we go. Okay.

1377
01:19:34.750 --> 01:19:37.708
You know what? If you just get out
and walk around, it's faster!

1378
01:19:37.791 --> 01:19:39.416
No, no, no! It's easier this way.

1379
01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:41.208
- No!
- I'm moving. I'm in too deep.

1380
01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:42.333
I made the commitment.

1381
01:19:42.416 --> 01:19:45.875
Just... Okay, all units,
suspects fleeing northbound on Elm.

1382
01:19:45.958 --> 01:19:47.833
All right, come on, go, go, go!

1383
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:51.416
Oh, Jesus! Oh, Jesus!

1384
01:19:57.958 --> 01:20:00.358
This is the first time
I've seen you look attractive.

1385
01:20:00.416 --> 01:20:04.416
This is the dress that I was going to wear
when your father finally came around.

1386
01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:07.375
It's sexy. It's tasteful.

1387
01:20:07.875 --> 01:20:09.833
I look like a meth-head lottery winner

1388
01:20:09.916 --> 01:20:12.708
marrying Machine Gun Kelly
at a cruise boat casino.

1389
01:20:12.791 --> 01:20:15.083
I love Machine Gun Kelly.

1390
01:20:15.166 --> 01:20:17.708
He has that skinny dick energy.

1391
01:20:18.833 --> 01:20:21.458
Hey, we got that cash delivery!

1392
01:20:22.708 --> 01:20:23.541
Bitches!

1393
01:20:23.625 --> 01:20:27.041
Finally. Interesting choice of vehicle.

1394
01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:30.750
Don't forget to give me five stars.

1395
01:20:31.916 --> 01:20:32.791
Uber?

1396
01:20:45.666 --> 01:20:46.666
It's okay.

1397
01:20:50.250 --> 01:20:53.333
It's all right there. Five million.

1398
01:20:55.791 --> 01:20:57.125
Where are Billy and Lilly?

1399
01:20:57.208 --> 01:20:58.875
They're off distracting the police.

1400
01:21:02.583 --> 01:21:04.892
Aw, shit. It's not the volume. Sorry.

1401
01:21:04.916 --> 01:21:06.958
Sorry! Just... Sorry, my bad.

1402
01:21:07.625 --> 01:21:11.708
Parker! What's up? It's RJ.
Remember Roy's Teppanyaki?

1403
01:21:11.791 --> 01:21:13.000
Wow.

1404
01:21:13.625 --> 01:21:16.291
Owen... you did it!

1405
01:21:16.375 --> 01:21:19.125
Bravo! Very well done!

1406
01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:20.875
Well, look.

1407
01:21:20.958 --> 01:21:24.375
My debt is paid, you're free to go.

1408
01:21:24.875 --> 01:21:27.125
I think we should just
split this money 50/50,

1409
01:21:27.208 --> 01:21:28.541
as a wedding present.

1410
01:21:29.041 --> 01:21:32.416
I'm joking! I'm going to
kill the shit out of both of you.

1411
01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:35.833
Nope! Freeze, all right?
Stay right where you are!

1412
01:21:36.916 --> 01:21:37.916
I got you now!

1413
01:21:38.666 --> 01:21:39.500
Let her go.

1414
01:21:39.583 --> 01:21:42.500
Oh, Owen, you're so sweet!
Put that gun down, you man-child.

1415
01:21:42.583 --> 01:21:44.375
What the fuck do you think you're doing?

1416
01:21:45.958 --> 01:21:48.291
Did they give me
a fuckin' water gun again?

1417
01:21:52.375 --> 01:21:53.666
Oh!

1418
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:56.375
- Oh, my God!
- Holy fucking shit!

1419
01:21:56.458 --> 01:21:59.666
Whoa!
My cuz is a straight-up murderer!

1420
01:21:59.750 --> 01:22:02.916
Oh! Oh, God! Parker.

1421
01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.267
- Owen, are you okay?
- Parker, Parker, Parker! Oh, my God.

1422
01:22:05.291 --> 01:22:07.166
Parker! Are you okay?

1423
01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:08.970
- Yeah.
- Are you okay? Oh, my God.

1424
01:22:11.916 --> 01:22:14.083
Oh, you...

1425
01:22:18.750 --> 01:22:20.875
- My God, what happened?
- I don't know.

1426
01:22:20.958 --> 01:22:23.333
I got sweat on my gun
so I thought it was a squirt gun.

1427
01:22:23.416 --> 01:22:25.416
- It wasn't. It was a bullet gun.
- What?

1428
01:22:25.500 --> 01:22:29.041
What the fuck? You guys are bank robbers?
You've been lying to me my entire life?

1429
01:22:29.125 --> 01:22:32.250
We're trying to protect you, baby.
That's why we don't see you.

1430
01:22:32.333 --> 01:22:35.000
- We're trying to keep you safe.
- And what about Owen, huh?

1431
01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:37.333
You dragged him into it.
What if he'd gotten killed?

1432
01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:40.000
You... You couldn't
have held him back if you tried.

1433
01:22:40.083 --> 01:22:41.083
Really?

1434
01:22:41.791 --> 01:22:44.541
You're the most important person
in the world to me, so...

1435
01:22:47.333 --> 01:22:51.041
He's a top man, he... he did really well.

1436
01:22:51.125 --> 01:22:52.125
I've...

1437
01:22:52.958 --> 01:22:54.125
I've grown fond of you.

1438
01:22:54.208 --> 01:22:55.333

01:22:58.375 --> 01:23:00.583
Nah, put that hand away.

1441
01:23:00.666 --> 01:23:02.125
- We're family.
- What?

1442
01:23:02.208 --> 01:23:04.166
- Hey!
- Oh!

1443
01:23:04.750 --> 01:23:06.541
- I didn't use tongue.
- I did.

1444
01:23:06.625 --> 01:23:08.476
Uh-oh. Here we go, showtime.

1445
01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:10.958
We dragged every cop in the city here.
Go on, skedaddle.

1446
01:23:11.041 --> 01:23:13.208
You don't want to be in jail
on your wedding day.

1447

- Move it.
- Love you.

We pled guilty, and then we tracked down
