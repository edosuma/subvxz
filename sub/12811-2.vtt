00:00.547 --> 00:03.506
Humans are free to come and go
from the Zone area as they wish,

00:03.507 --> 00:05.986
but Hairies who try
and exit the Zone will be detained.

00:05.987 --> 00:08.146
It's alright, we're not gonna hurt you.

00:09.315 --> 00:11.026
Nice doing business with you.
You screw us and you'll pay.

00:11.027 --> 00:13.066
I'd like to report a sighting -
a family of five.

00:13.067 --> 00:15.267
Prepare a retrieval process.

00:18.227 --> 00:21.947
80,000 years, the Hairypeople
have been on this planet.

00:23.921 --> 00:27.081
I've had enough.
Take it. You're a man now, son.

00:29.639 --> 00:33.038
Jimmy's been off the rails of late,
but he was, at heart, a good man.

00:33.039 --> 00:36.256
And I hope, as his next in line,
to do the same.

00:39.145 --> 00:40.625
Ngaluunggirr.

00:43.919 --> 00:46.398
How are you going, guys? Straight
passes. Lilly, straight passes.

00:46.399 --> 00:49.199
Cam, you've gotta focus on this.
This is a weak area for you.

00:52.239 --> 00:55.198
- Just kick it straight.
- Come on!

00:55.199 --> 00:57.838
Kick it straight. Come on, mate.
That's not good enough.

00:57.839 --> 00:59.638
On the game on Saturday,
you let yourself down

00:59.639 --> 01:01.158
'cause you weren't doing it, OK?

01:01.159 --> 01:03.159
Straight as an arrow. Let's go.

01:07.039 --> 01:09.118
- Cam...
- Loser.

01:09.119 --> 01:10.395
...go and get it.

01:11.119 --> 01:12.889
Go and get it. Go on.

01:20.039 --> 01:21.519
Grab this one.

01:22.759 --> 01:24.239
Good.

He's alright.

03:51.199 --> 03:53.844
Dad loved me
more than he loved you, Koen!

03:54.919 --> 03:57.518
Your mum is a white whore. Say it!

03:57.519 --> 03:59.718
Come on, say it!

03:59.719 --> 04:02.185
Koen, say your mum is a white whore.

04:03.599 --> 04:06.438
Say it, Koen! Say it! No!

04:07.097 --> 04:08.879
Your mum is a white whore.

04:11.559 --> 04:13.039
You coconut.

04:21.999 --> 04:24.599
- You!
- What you doing out here, brother?

04:32.097 --> 04:34.418
Don't suppose you take a direct deposit?

04:35.279 --> 04:39.225
Oi! I don't want you boys
fighting around here, you hear me?

04:39.719 --> 04:42.078
I forgot what flat you were,
Aunty Linda.

04:42.079 --> 04:44.958
- Who's that?
- I need to talk, Aunty.

04:44.959 --> 04:46.439
- Koen?
- Yeah.

04:48.239 --> 04:50.047
OK. You better come up, then.

04:52.016 --> 04:54.079
Piss off, you hairy buggers.
He's family.

05:00.639 --> 05:02.639
Hey, Aunty! Hey!

05:03.719 --> 05:05.638
Koen, come in!

05:05.639 --> 05:08.448
Look at you all grown up.

05:30.210 --> 05:33.237
I'm hoping you can tell me why
Uncle Jimmy picked me.

05:33.239 --> 05:36.165
I gave up wondering why
Jimmy did what he did.

05:41.759 --> 05:44.455
Waruu's going to be mighty pissed off.

05:44.879 --> 05:46.878
Ever since you two were little,

05:46.879 --> 05:49.238
Waruu's been dreaming of
becoming the Cleverman.

05:49.239 --> 05:52.358
He's been waiting for this day all
his life, now his little brother...

05:52.359 --> 05:54.606
- Half-brother.
- Steals his thunder.

05:55.652 --> 05:58.268
It's a big responsibility, Koen.

05:58.719 --> 06:01.232
Cleverman is more than just a title.

06:04.999 --> 06:08.965
Whatever reason Jimmy had,
you got a chance to start over.

06:10.759 --> 06:12.070
Here.

06:14.679 --> 06:19.838
This belonged to your father.
Kept his uni stuff in it.

06:19.839 --> 06:24.391
- Where'd you get that?
- Found it, after the accident.

06:27.314 --> 06:31.318
I put other stuff in photos,
anything I could grab at the time,

06:31.319 --> 06:33.319
which wasn't much.

06:37.639 --> 06:39.211
The past is the past.

06:40.119 --> 06:41.475
Can't change it.

06:42.839 --> 06:45.039
All you can do is try to do better.

06:48.919 --> 06:50.971
Your father, he wasn't perfect.

06:53.119 --> 06:57.079
He was a man,
with all the faults of a man.

06:59.319 --> 07:01.038
And he was your father.

07:05.039 --> 07:09.519
Your gift, Koen.
That's yours and yours alone now.

07:10.959 --> 07:14.438
No-one can tell you what to do with it.

07:14.439 --> 07:19.478
That's the good of it
and the curse of it, mark my words.

07:19.790 --> 07:21.511
I see things too.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.408
What kind of things?

07:23.409 --> 07:24.852
You in a clinic.

07:27.804 --> 07:28.918
Cancer.

07:29.456 --> 07:32.557
All through my lymph nodes.
Doctors gave me six months.

07:32.559 --> 07:33.629
They can't treat it?

07:35.279 --> 07:37.401
Better medication at home.

07:40.599 --> 07:42.079
I'm sorry.

07:43.759 --> 07:45.727
I can get you more gear if you need it.

07:46.919 --> 07:48.599
You saw all that, eh?

07:53.199 --> 07:54.803
What are you gonna do with it?

08:19.599 --> 08:21.679
Oi. Stop it.

08:22.879 --> 08:24.558
You don't need a title.

08:24.559 --> 08:26.458
Cleverman's not just a title.

08:27.039 --> 08:28.842
Dad? Harry's here.

08:34.159 --> 08:36.438
We need to take some action here.

08:36.438 --> 08:37.918
Yeah, yeah, I know.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.198
Where's the rest of that family
they captured, then?

08:40.198 --> 08:41.994
Alinta, can you get my phone, please?

08:43.119 --> 08:47.318
I've got something to show you.
These were taken last week.

08:48.079 --> 08:49.290
So what are they?

08:49.999 --> 08:52.799
Trucks, 20 of them in one day.

08:59.119 --> 09:00.719
Hey, stranger.

09:09.691 --> 09:11.678
You don't know what they're
transporting in those trucks?

09:11.679 --> 09:13.158
Could just be frozen chicken.

09:13.159 --> 09:15.478
Frozen chickens don't need ventilation.

09:15.479 --> 09:16.615
So what next?

09:17.359 --> 09:19.078
I found a guy on the inside, Waruu.

09:19.079 --> 09:21.198
Says he can get us into the main cells.

09:21.199 --> 09:22.958
- A guard?
- Yeah.

09:22.959 --> 09:24.718
He has a master key to the building.

09:24.719 --> 09:28.278
Look, say we get in, then what?
Bust every Hairy out of there?

09:28.744 --> 09:32.297
What are you gonna do with them?
Are you gonna bring them here?

09:32.606 --> 09:34.462
Give the CA the excuse
they've been waiting for?

09:34.463 --> 09:36.510
We'll be ready for them when they do.

09:36.535 --> 09:38.038
Choppers, assault vehicles,

09:38.039 --> 09:41.118
high-powered weapons.
Nah, brother. I got family here.

09:41.119 --> 09:42.918
We all got families!

09:42.919 --> 09:45.478
This is a political situation,
Harry. It needs a political fix.

09:45.479 --> 09:48.158
Come on, man!
If it was Alinta in there...

09:48.159 --> 09:51.417
Political fix, Harry,
why I'm going on this show, yeah?

09:51.418 --> 09:53.427
We got to do this the right way.

10:08.079 --> 10:12.078
Oi! You shouldn't be doing that.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.279
Hey, brother, they'll flog ya!

10:17.039 --> 10:18.965
What do you think you're doing, rug?

10:20.119 --> 10:22.199
Everyone eat cement!

10:25.199 --> 10:28.317
I knew you were going to
cause trouble for us, rug.

10:30.639 --> 10:33.239
You think you're king of the rugs
or something, do ya?

10:36.399 --> 10:38.599
Come on, then!

10:57.399 --> 11:00.159
Oi! Oi, get your hands off him!

11:30.839 --> 11:32.319
Girl?

11:33.359 --> 11:35.380
I know you're in there.

11:36.079 --> 11:38.413
I know you must be hungry too.

12:16.519 --> 12:19.398
Leave the plate out,
if you wouldn't mind.

12:19.723 --> 12:25.079
Or I'm in B27, if you care to visit.

12:27.879 --> 12:29.359
Alright, then.

13:02.199 --> 13:05.518
Stop filming. Put your cameras away.
Turn it off.

13:05.519 --> 13:07.238
You people are not supposed to be here.

13:07.239 --> 13:10.158
We were the first on the scene.
There's no other news crews here.

13:10.159 --> 13:12.038
There's not gonna be anyone else either.

13:12.039 --> 13:14.158
It's our exclusive
for the next hour, at least.

13:14.159 --> 13:15.065
How?

13:15.090 --> 13:17.238
We'll break the story in
the middle of the show,

13:17.239 --> 13:19.598
cross to you. So be ready to go.

13:19.599 --> 13:23.478
OK. We should let Waruu know
about this development,

13:23.479 --> 13:26.038
give him a chance
to prepare his response.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.620
Let me think about it.

14:06.719 --> 14:08.679
Why didn't you say something?

14:10.799 --> 14:14.026
I couldn't bear to see you
put on that brave-little-boy face.

14:16.359 --> 14:19.642
I see you've relegated America
to the dustbin of history.

14:19.919 --> 14:23.758
No, the US gets a placemat
for outstanding achievement.

14:23.759 --> 14:25.504
It's the whole of Western civilisation

14:25.505 --> 14:26.872
that's down the plughole.

14:27.679 --> 14:30.838
Perhaps it's just as well, then,
that I can't...

14:30.839 --> 14:33.518
Baby, we can try again.

14:33.519 --> 14:34.999
No, we...

14:36.679 --> 14:38.442
We've been over this.

14:44.279 --> 14:46.958
You know, Nixon had a
speech already prepared

14:46.959 --> 14:48.635
for the death of the astronauts.

14:49.399 --> 14:51.518
They were so desperate
to beat the Ruskies,

14:51.519 --> 14:54.278
they went up ahead of schedule,
more on a hope and a prayer.

14:54.279 --> 14:56.398
Are you going to tell the story
about Neil Armstrong

14:56.399 --> 14:58.078
restarting the landing module

14:58.079 --> 15:00.999
with just a paperclip
and seconds to spare?

15:02.559 --> 15:04.079
It was Buzz Aldrin...

15:05.079 --> 15:06.621
...and it was a biro.

15:08.759 --> 15:10.558
The point is that, often,

15:10.559 --> 15:12.389
the only difference between
triumph and failure...

15:12.414 --> 15:13.450
My love...

15:14.439 --> 15:16.278
...I'm not giving up, I'm just...

15:17.279 --> 15:19.543
I'm drawing a line in the sand.

15:28.919 --> 15:30.839
It's all good, baby.

15:31.839 --> 15:33.319
Sorry.

15:51.239 --> 15:53.119
I am the Cleverman.

15:55.559 --> 15:57.559
I am the Cleverman.

15:59.919 --> 16:01.919
I am the Cleverman.

16:53.199 --> 16:54.919
Through this way.

17:03.599 --> 17:05.079
Stop!

17:19.439 --> 17:21.397
What have you got for me?

17:21.398 --> 17:23.117
- One of these.
- One?

17:23.118 --> 17:24.637
Just fuckin' pick one.

17:24.638 --> 17:27.278
- It's not that simple, darling.
- They're all as hairy as each other.

17:27.279 --> 17:30.104
- One's as good as the next.
- Haven't you ever been to the pound?

17:30.759 --> 17:32.928
You don't just take any old Shih tzu.

17:33.519 --> 17:35.758
When's my money going to
come through, huh?

17:35.759 --> 17:39.558
- Do you understand me, pet?
- That one's English isn't great.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.832
Shame that. I do need English.

17:42.399 --> 17:43.479
Take me.

17:47.319 --> 17:49.679
Aren't you a feisty one?

17:55.119 --> 17:57.938
And what is it you think
you're volunteering for, love?

18:00.039 --> 18:01.464
It doesn't matter.

18:04.199 --> 18:05.616
Smile for me.

18:06.359 --> 18:07.839
Teeth.

18:13.159 --> 18:14.120
Hands.

18:16.719 --> 18:19.119
Good, not too big.

18:23.039 --> 18:26.187
Pelt's a gorgeous colour.
You all natural?

18:26.959 --> 18:28.959
- Yes?
- Good. Lucky girl.

18:31.119 --> 18:32.686
You're older than I'd like.

18:33.439 --> 18:36.679
- I'll do what you want.
- Oh, yes, you will. Won't you, pet?

18:40.679 --> 18:42.539
Yes, I've found what I need.

18:43.039 --> 18:44.888
Sorry, ladies.

19:30.439 --> 19:31.845
Hello again.

19:32.359 --> 19:34.197
The disappearing girl.

19:37.919 --> 19:39.478
Thanks for returning it.

19:39.479 --> 19:42.803
It was just out of a jar,
but it fills the hole.

19:44.559 --> 19:45.805
My name's Virgil.

19:46.319 --> 19:49.599
It's a strange name,
but I've lived with it a long time.

19:51.159 --> 19:52.269
Hi.

19:53.319 --> 19:55.383
Will you join me for tea?

20:01.119 --> 20:02.545
I know what you are,

20:04.147 --> 20:05.269
and I don't care.

20:31.679 --> 20:36.798
Good evening, I'm Jane O'Grady.
And tonight, the subhuman crisis.

20:36.799 --> 20:38.718
We evaluate the Government's approach

20:38.719 --> 20:41.072
to its handling
of the subhuman conundrum.

20:41.097 --> 20:42.214
Take a seat, if you'd like.

20:42.620 --> 20:43.998
Watch it with me.

20:43.999 --> 20:46.519
Just move that stuff off. Sit.

20:47.519 --> 20:48.385
Please.

20:48.386 --> 20:52.118
Tonight, my guest in the studio
is Minister for Immigration

20:52.119 --> 20:53.878
and Border Protection, Geoff Matthews.

20:53.879 --> 20:55.358
Good to be here, Jane.

20:55.359 --> 20:57.878
Also with me is my guest, Mr Waruu West,

20:57.879 --> 21:00.998
Indigenous community leader
and advocate for the Hairypeoples.

21:00.999 --> 21:02.478
Mr West, welcome.

21:02.479 --> 21:04.438
I'm here as community leader
in the Zone.

21:04.439 --> 21:07.478
- Thanks for having me on the program.
- He's a bit of a spunk!

21:07.479 --> 21:10.878
Minister, I'll start with you
and the announcement today

21:10.879 --> 21:13.398
that the Government is committing
another 107 million

21:13.399 --> 21:16.358
to its new subhuman containment
and resettlement efforts.

21:16.359 --> 21:19.118
I'll jump in there, Jane, and
question the terminology being used,

21:19.119 --> 21:21.278
in language that would make
George Orwell proud.

21:21.279 --> 21:22.958
What you're really talking about here

21:22.959 --> 21:26.278
is the forcible removal
of innocent people from their homes,

21:26.279 --> 21:29.918
separating mothers from daughters,
fathers from sons.

21:29.919 --> 21:33.318
The truth is, this Government
is tearing whole families,

21:33.319 --> 21:36.478
entire communities apart,
and taking them God only knows where.

21:36.479 --> 21:38.118
I can't discuss operational matters.

21:38.119 --> 21:41.678
Suffice to say, it is not anything
like Mr West is making out.

21:41.679 --> 21:43.398
That's a relief, Minister, thank you.

21:43.399 --> 21:45.958
They are well provided for
in clean, safe accommodation.

21:45.959 --> 21:47.358
Well, let's see them.

21:47.359 --> 21:48.495
Linta!

21:49.159 --> 21:50.638
- Linta!
- What?

21:50.639 --> 21:52.158
Hurry up. Your dad's on TV.

21:52.159 --> 21:54.598
Better still, tell us where
these containment centres are

21:54.599 --> 21:56.078
so we can see them for ourselves.

21:56.079 --> 21:57.718
- Why the secrecy?
- Well, for the protection...

21:57.719 --> 21:59.838
You only hide something
if you have something to hide.

21:59.839 --> 22:01.878
Mr West favours integration.

22:01.879 --> 22:05.118
I'm sympathetic to that
as a possible long-term solution,

22:05.119 --> 22:07.598
- but this is a complex question...
- Tighter, Camera 1.

22:07.599 --> 22:09.598
...this government is working hard
to find a solution for.

22:09.599 --> 22:11.958
These are very serious issues.

22:11.959 --> 22:14.278
We have a large population of subhumans.

22:14.279 --> 22:15.718
They're people, Geoff.

22:15.719 --> 22:18.718
Can we just accept that they are not
sub anything, but people?

22:18.719 --> 22:21.398
Why don't you allow reporters
into your containment centres?

22:21.399 --> 22:24.078
- Give us a guided tour, on camera.
- It's a simple matter of security.

22:24.079 --> 22:27.478
- Rosie, who's that?
- Ah, West's right-hand man.

22:27.479 --> 22:30.079
Give me a close-up on his hands.

22:31.079 --> 22:34.838
As long as the country keeps
voting for us, that's what we'll do.

22:34.839 --> 22:37.478
He's a shaved-down Hairy.
Look at his little finger.

22:37.479 --> 22:38.958
In addition to that,

22:38.959 --> 22:41.158
we have to protect the privacy
of our containment clients.

22:41.159 --> 22:43.078
So they don't have a right to a trial,

22:43.079 --> 22:45.198
but that doesn't matter because
you're protecting their privacy?

22:45.199 --> 22:47.798
Subhumans are an innately violent race.

22:47.799 --> 22:49.998
Not true. Come on, day one,

22:49.999 --> 22:52.678
first contact, one tried to rip
the throat out of a police sergeant.

22:52.679 --> 22:54.438
People become violent for a reason.

22:54.439 --> 22:56.758
- Would you like to elaborate?
- Hairypeople are concerned

22:56.759 --> 22:58.358
that their people are disappearing.

22:58.359 --> 23:00.638
Trucks come in the middle
of the night and take them...

23:00.639 --> 23:01.425
Total fabrication.

23:01.450 --> 23:03.518
Geoff, sorry, I'll have
to ask you to hold on.

23:03.519 --> 23:05.158
Mr West, could you clarify
what you mean?

23:05.159 --> 23:06.878
Does he have any proof
of these allegations?

23:06.879 --> 23:08.998
- People have come to me...
- Mr West cannot keep making

23:08.999 --> 23:10.918
these slanderous accusations.

23:10.919 --> 23:13.318
Excuse me, Minister,
the Zone was not your creation.

23:13.319 --> 23:16.518
If it wasn't for Aboriginal people
occupying the old railway station,

23:16.519 --> 23:17.998
there wouldn't be a Zone.

23:17.999 --> 23:20.598
It has become a vibrant and diverse
suburb in this city.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.598
We welcome the Hairypeople
to live with us.

23:22.599 --> 23:25.598
- Look at this big man.
- You're the ones that put up a wall.

23:25.599 --> 23:27.238
You're the ones that built a checkpoint.

23:27.239 --> 23:28.918
You're the ones who issued ID cards,

23:28.919 --> 23:30.598
and now you won't
take any responsibility.

23:30.599 --> 23:33.478
Could you clarify what you mean
by 'disappearing?'

23:33.479 --> 23:36.038
- People have come to me...
- Hairypeople?

23:36.039 --> 23:38.758
...have complained to me that
ever since Emergence Day,

23:38.759 --> 23:42.358
Hairy brothers and sisters
began to disappear one by one.

23:42.359 --> 23:45.398
Uh, I'm sorry, I'm just receiving
a feed from the newsroom.

23:45.399 --> 23:46.878
Alright.

23:46.879 --> 23:48.478
And to people at home, I'm sorry,

23:48.479 --> 23:50.918
we're going to have to interrupt
our regular program

23:50.919 --> 23:52.878
with a story that's just breaking.

23:52.879 --> 23:54.918
Crossing live now. Cue Belinda.

23:54.919 --> 23:57.558
Shocking news just at hand

23:57.559 --> 24:00.118
of the death of 12-year-old
schoolboy, Cameron Wells,

24:00.119 --> 24:01.718
who was viciously attacked and murdered

24:01.719 --> 24:04.878
while at soccer training
at a local park earlier this evening.

24:04.879 --> 24:07.518
It is thought that his death
might be linked to a similar attack

24:07.519 --> 24:09.798
only last week on one James West.

24:09.799 --> 24:11.478
A warning to viewers at home,

24:11.479 --> 24:13.478
people may find
the following images distressing.

24:13.479 --> 24:15.798
There's a terrible sense of despair

24:15.799 --> 24:17.758
and growing fear
at tonight's events, Jane,

24:17.759 --> 24:20.238
and not just because
of Cameron's tender age,

24:20.239 --> 24:22.478
but the particularly
brutal way in which he was killed

24:22.479 --> 24:26.198
- in front of his clubmates.
- Can you confirm the cause of death?

24:26.199 --> 24:28.198
We have to wait for
the Coroner's report.

24:28.199 --> 24:30.757
The heart was removed
from the boy's chest

24:30.758 --> 24:32.918
in much the same manner as James West's?

24:32.919 --> 24:36.198
There's been no confirmation
for the precise nature of the killing

24:36.199 --> 24:38.318
or species of the killer.

24:38.319 --> 24:40.478
But if it is true that subhuman peoples

24:40.479 --> 24:42.238
have incredibly strong fingernails,

24:42.239 --> 24:44.598
it wouldn't be too far a stretch to say

24:44.599 --> 24:47.478
that this crime might be the work
of a Hairyperson?

24:47.479 --> 24:50.478
At this stage, the police aren't
ruling anything out.

24:50.479 --> 24:52.278
It's just yet another
terrifying prospect

24:52.279 --> 24:54.398
for our already frightened
communities to have to manage.

24:54.399 --> 24:55.878
Distressing news, Belinda.

24:55.879 --> 24:58.839
We'll be crossing back for updates
as the story unfolds...

25:02.359 --> 25:04.358
How dare you people use my uncle's death

25:04.359 --> 25:06.238
to manipulate public perception?

25:06.239 --> 25:08.358
What happened to Cameron is a tragedy,

25:08.359 --> 25:11.438
but we must be very careful
not to jump the gun here.

25:11.439 --> 25:13.238
It's important
that everybody remain calm

25:13.239 --> 25:14.838
in the face of this new...

25:14.839 --> 25:17.918
They said things about my people
from time to time,

25:17.919 --> 25:23.279
that we ate children, turned
Christian children into matzo.

25:24.599 --> 25:28.570
I think I know how this story ends.
Shall we watch something else?

25:29.159 --> 25:31.598
Our patience, as a nation,
with the subhuman issue...

25:31.599 --> 25:36.426
I'm sorry about your family.
That young girl, was that...?

25:36.799 --> 25:37.899
My sister.

25:37.900 --> 25:40.958
Waruu, one final question for you, then.

25:40.959 --> 25:42.798
In Aboriginal storytelling,

25:42.799 --> 25:44.758
sometimes referred to as Dreamtime,

25:44.759 --> 25:48.718
is it true that fathers would warn
their children not to leave camp

25:48.719 --> 25:51.385
for fear of what the Hairypeople
might do?

25:52.479 --> 25:56.879
Firstly, it's the Dreaming,
present tense.

25:58.039 --> 25:59.714
Our stories are not static.

26:00.039 --> 26:01.758
They're not locked in the past,

26:01.759 --> 26:04.638
just as Hairypeople are not bound
by what is.

26:04.639 --> 26:06.318
I'm not sure I'm understanding.

26:06.319 --> 26:09.358
Look, I will say this,
over the course of our history,

26:09.359 --> 26:12.078
Hairypeople have lived side by side,
in peace,

26:12.079 --> 26:15.804
so peaceful, in fact, none of us knew
they existed till six months ago.

26:16.359 --> 26:19.158
What happened to Cameron Wells
is truly regrettable,

26:19.159 --> 26:20.838
but we can't jump to conclusions.

26:20.839 --> 26:23.718
We must let the judicial system
handle this, not the media.

26:23.719 --> 26:25.198
Wrapping-up time.

26:25.199 --> 26:28.358
Gentlemen, thank you very much
for coming on the program tonight.

26:28.359 --> 26:29.919
Thank you, Jane.

26:32.559 --> 26:35.679
See? That's how you get fucked, Waruu.

26:40.839 --> 26:43.158
You bastards set me up.

26:43.159 --> 26:45.883
And what makes you a spokesperson
for your people, hm?

26:47.039 --> 26:49.678
You never finished high school,
you don't have a job.

26:49.679 --> 26:52.278
You live on government handouts
and your wife's salary.

26:52.279 --> 26:54.427
Unlike you, I did my homework.

27:01.599 --> 27:04.639
Mr West, I just want to thank you.

27:09.959 --> 27:11.439
Hi.

27:12.919 --> 27:14.003
I'm Harry.

27:30.159 --> 27:31.659
What am I thinking?

27:32.239 --> 27:34.039
Porn.

27:35.479 --> 27:37.118
Ah!

27:37.119 --> 27:38.599
Alright.

27:39.639 --> 27:40.931
What about now?

27:50.039 --> 27:51.918
Bestiality porn.

27:51.919 --> 27:53.679
You're a bastard!

27:55.399 --> 27:56.891
No, really, what did you see?

27:57.571 --> 27:59.558
You're a dirty dog.

28:01.999 --> 28:03.436
I'll drink to that.

28:04.199 --> 28:05.719
With lemons!

28:08.599 --> 28:10.478
Agh! What are you doing to me, brother?

28:10.479 --> 28:12.078
Keep talking! Keep talking!
How does it feel?

28:12.079 --> 28:13.678
Ahhh!

28:13.679 --> 28:16.158
- It stings.
- Hot, cold?

28:16.159 --> 28:18.278
Cold. Shit, look!

28:18.279 --> 28:19.612
Look, look!

28:21.399 --> 28:23.919
- It still hurting?
- Less.

28:25.799 --> 28:31.278
See, that was, what, like,
seven seconds... ish?

28:31.279 --> 28:32.568
Ish.

28:33.319 --> 28:35.600
- Is it healed on the inside?
- Oh no.

28:36.159 --> 28:37.821
No, it's still tender.

28:39.999 --> 28:43.959
That demonstrates a level of
awesomeness that is truly bad-arse.

28:45.879 --> 28:50.038
- Go again, go again!
- Don't you do that again!

28:50.039 --> 28:52.679
- His body heals itself!
- Put it down!

28:54.079 --> 28:57.198
- I was just playing.
- Ngaluunggirr.

28:57.199 --> 28:59.199
Ngaluunggirr.

29:00.999 --> 29:02.679
Hey? I'm sorry, babe.

29:05.399 --> 29:07.262
You still love me, though, eh?

29:15.359 --> 29:16.958
BELINDA, ON PHONE: Well, hello.

29:16.959 --> 29:19.638
I told you about what happened
to my uncle in confidence.

29:19.639 --> 29:24.118
Yeah, I understand, and I'm sorry,
but this is my job. You know that.

29:24.119 --> 29:25.719
Go to hell.

29:46.879 --> 29:48.639
Ngaluunggirr.

30:09.959 --> 30:12.279
That eye still weirds me out.

30:31.199 --> 30:32.701
I'm just getting static.

30:42.439 --> 30:44.398
Koen, what's happening?

30:44.399 --> 30:46.292
I'm OK, alright? Just...

30:46.839 --> 30:48.679
It's just my head.

30:49.759 --> 30:51.405
I'm fine, really.

30:54.050 --> 30:55.997
I want to be left alone.

31:12.519 --> 31:14.519
Ngaluunggirr.

31:35.959 --> 31:37.439
Hey.

31:38.439 --> 31:39.959
Come to bed.

32:43.399 --> 32:44.937
You're awake, are you?

32:49.479 --> 32:50.850
How old are you?

32:52.119 --> 32:53.599
How old are YOU?

32:54.839 --> 32:56.274
I'm 71.

32:57.279 --> 32:58.759
I'm 16.

33:01.959 --> 33:06.678
Your people live a long time,
don't they, hundreds of years?

33:06.679 --> 33:09.639
And here you are, 16.

33:10.919 --> 33:12.029
I'm 15.

33:12.030 --> 33:14.839
Fif...!

33:17.839 --> 33:22.799
Oh, that's not fair! That's not
fair, to make me laugh like that.

33:25.039 --> 33:27.140
Oh, don't ever get old, love.

33:27.519 --> 33:29.759
Everyone treats you like
you're an idiot.

33:31.559 --> 33:33.061
Fifteen!

33:34.799 --> 33:37.668
Hey, you want to have some
breakfast? I've got some cereal.

33:38.159 --> 33:40.359
On the bench. Can you...?

33:55.079 --> 33:56.959
What's your plan, girl?

33:57.847 --> 34:00.345
My family are gonna come back for me.

34:02.359 --> 34:04.599
Your family are not coming back, girl.

34:05.959 --> 34:10.159
You can stay, with me, I mean,
as long as you like...

34:11.879 --> 34:13.879
...but they'll eventually find you.

34:15.679 --> 34:18.518
Hey, I can help you.

34:19.599 --> 34:21.228
I make things.

34:24.879 --> 34:28.194
But you have to decide
who it is you want to be.

34:47.399 --> 34:48.578
Djukara?

34:49.409 --> 34:50.358
Djukara!

34:54.998 --> 34:55.978
Dad.

34:56.958 --> 34:59.398
Where's Mum? Where's Latani?

34:59.718 --> 35:00.879
I don't know.

35:02.839 --> 35:03.866
Boss.

35:05.479 --> 35:07.963
I'm memorising every
door code and key I see.

35:09.525 --> 35:11.038
I'm figuring a way out.

35:11.039 --> 35:12.921
The main thing is, we stay alive.

35:13.399 --> 35:15.918
Yeah, and get out of here.

35:15.919 --> 35:17.558
That's not what I'm saying, son.

35:17.559 --> 35:21.318
Dad, they killed Jirra. There's
no way this doesn't end in blood.

35:21.319 --> 35:24.719
Hey, rug! What's going on down there?

35:25.879 --> 35:26.745
Nothing, boss.

35:26.770 --> 35:28.623
Why don't you mind your own business?

35:28.706 --> 35:31.010
_

35:33.759 --> 35:35.918
What'd you just say to him?

35:35.919 --> 35:37.918
Told him he was a young, foolish boy.

35:37.919 --> 35:40.278
Oh, is that it?
Sounded like more than that.

35:40.279 --> 35:42.497
Told him he had to fit in.

35:45.039 --> 35:47.160
In this society, we have to be social.

35:47.639 --> 35:49.158
We can all live together.

35:51.599 --> 35:54.398
Yeah! Yeah, that's right.

35:54.399 --> 35:56.238
Yeah.

35:56.239 --> 35:57.656
Socialise.

35:58.559 --> 36:01.760
Once you all learn that,
everything's going to be just fine.

36:03.159 --> 36:04.328
Yes, boss.

36:04.719 --> 36:06.160
Yes, boss.

36:06.399 --> 36:08.958
You know what, rug?
You got your head screwed on right.

36:08.959 --> 36:10.121
What's your name?

36:11.719 --> 36:13.198
Boondee.

36:13.199 --> 36:16.558
Yeah, I'm not going to use that
jungle shit.

36:16.559 --> 36:18.559
I'm going to call you...

36:19.599 --> 36:21.079
...Trevor.

36:25.359 --> 36:26.839
Yes, boss.

36:29.719 --> 36:31.599
You finish up here, Trevor.

36:39.287 --> 36:42.130
_

36:42.849 --> 36:44.849
_

36:45.787 --> 36:48.302
_

36:49.888 --> 36:51.255
_

36:52.119 --> 36:55.229
But you would rather clean their floors.

36:55.799 --> 36:59.919
So why don't you do your job?
Make them sparkle, slave!

37:07.467 --> 37:11.872
_

37:28.719 --> 37:32.078
Just keep an eye on her, and if
there's any sign of temperature,

37:32.079 --> 37:34.000
just bring her straight back in, OK?

37:34.599 --> 37:36.079
See ya!

37:37.399 --> 37:38.958
Wow! I like the flowers.

37:38.959 --> 37:40.525
That's good, they're for you.

37:42.039 --> 37:44.358
The delivery guy nearly shat himself,

37:44.359 --> 37:46.031
such a hurry to get out of the place.

37:51.759 --> 37:53.090
Everything alright?

37:55.319 --> 37:56.799
Oh, yeah.

38:09.439 --> 38:12.158
They're beautiful flowers, Jarrod.
Thanks.

38:12.159 --> 38:13.878
I was worried you wouldn't get them.

38:13.879 --> 38:16.918
They were adamant
they didn't deliver to the Zone.

38:16.919 --> 38:18.899
Had to pay a huge loading fee.

38:19.839 --> 38:24.518
Darling, it's just you and me. It's us.

38:24.519 --> 38:28.558
How about we give it one more try,
go back to the clinic?

38:28.559 --> 38:30.038
If nothing happens...

38:30.039 --> 38:32.039
I can't. I just...

38:34.279 --> 38:36.575
Can you please not ask me again?

38:37.934 --> 38:39.478
I'm building an ark for us.

38:39.479 --> 38:42.753
Look, I probably should get back
to work. Sorry, what did you say?

38:44.039 --> 38:45.128
Nothing.

38:46.519 --> 38:48.245
Hang in there, my love.

39:19.639 --> 39:20.861
Get up.

39:24.454 --> 39:25.839
Get the fuck up!

39:29.039 --> 39:30.839
Get up, monkey! Come here!

39:31.839 --> 39:37.134
These are for you. An ID card.
Carry that with you day and night.

39:38.541 --> 39:40.999
And the lenses, to cover your eyes.

39:44.119 --> 39:46.518
Oh, no. I hate goodbyes.

39:46.519 --> 39:48.898
You just do what you have to do
to survive.

39:50.839 --> 39:52.711
I don't know if I can.

39:53.759 --> 39:57.719
Remember, you're much faster
and stronger than they are.

40:12.679 --> 40:14.359
- Thank you.
- Mm.

40:31.119 --> 40:32.040
Hey, monkey,

40:32.587 --> 40:34.463
you ever heard of a whipping boy?

40:41.879 --> 40:43.350
Back in England,

40:44.030 --> 40:47.463
they used to think that kings
were appointed by God.

40:48.999 --> 40:53.230
You see, that made it very hard
to discipline a young prince.

40:54.278 --> 40:56.198
You couldn't
give him the back of your hand

40:56.199 --> 40:58.919
'cause he was God's special boy.

41:00.719 --> 41:03.238
You like to think that you're
God's special little boy,

41:03.239 --> 41:05.638
- don't you, monkey?
- I'm going to kill you!

41:06.052 --> 41:06.998
Ah.

41:06.999 --> 41:08.296
There,

41:08.799 --> 41:10.777
you interrupted my story.

41:17.479 --> 41:20.148
So anyway, someone had a bright idea.

41:21.079 --> 41:24.398
Instead of punishing the prince
when he misbehaved,

41:24.399 --> 41:28.506
they'd punish his best friend,
and the prince would feel bad

41:29.319 --> 41:32.388
'cause his friend was being punished
for something he had done.

41:34.153 --> 41:36.363
But we've got someone better than
your best friend.

41:36.799 --> 41:37.938
Bring him in!

41:46.083 --> 41:50.115
So from now on, when you're
a bad little boy who won't behave...

41:57.999 --> 42:00.958
Leave my father alone, please! Beat me!

42:00.959 --> 42:04.718
We already beat you, but you didn't
learn what we were trying to teach!

42:04.719 --> 42:06.918
- I get it!
- I don't think you do.

42:08.999 --> 42:10.918
Please stop it! Stop it!

42:10.919 --> 42:14.238
- You had your chance.
- Please! Don't hurt my father.

42:14.239 --> 42:18.118
Huh? Rules will be followed, won't they?

42:18.119 --> 42:19.758
- Yes, they will.
- Thank you!

42:22.559 --> 42:23.614
Get him up.

42:30.799 --> 42:32.316
We're not finished yet.

43:35.159 --> 43:37.742
Brother, I'm a Hairy,

43:37.999 --> 43:41.998
and you're telling me
we go into a prison full of Hairies

43:41.999 --> 43:44.861
who are being tortured,
and we just film.

43:45.119 --> 43:46.998
What's the fucking point of that?

43:46.999 --> 43:50.558
To show Joe Public what Matthews
is so desperate for them not to see.

43:50.559 --> 43:52.758
This is all about
sticking it up Matthews.

43:52.759 --> 43:55.317
People need to know.
People don't give a shit.

43:55.879 --> 43:57.598
We're not like them, so they don't care.

43:57.599 --> 43:59.358
You're wrong. They don't know any better

43:59.359 --> 44:00.931
because they're because manipulated
by the Government.

44:00.932 --> 44:03.158
You can say that
'cause you're not a Hairy.

44:03.521 --> 44:04.758
I have to live it every day.

44:04.759 --> 44:06.931
Don't tell me I don't get it,
I'm a blackfella.

44:07.492 --> 44:09.484
You heard what Matthews said to me
in there -

44:10.199 --> 44:12.279
I'm a pariah in my own country.

44:14.439 --> 44:18.068
We go in with cameras
or we don't go in at all.

44:31.719 --> 44:33.199
Up!

44:40.279 --> 44:42.358
Leave him alone, you dogs!

44:42.359 --> 44:43.838
Come on!

45:51.719 --> 45:54.319
Stay strong, bro.

46:05.319 --> 46:06.879
Happy, Trevor?

46:10.199 --> 46:11.679
Free haircut.

47:18.159 --> 47:19.639
Ngaluunggirr.

47:22.319 --> 47:23.799
Ngaluunggirr.

47:24.799 --> 47:26.078
Ngaluunggirr!

47:27.959 --> 47:29.439
Ngaluunggirr.

47:32.239 --> 47:33.718
Ngaluunggirr.

47:34.959 --> 47:36.479
Ngaluunggirr.

47:39.479 --> 47:40.959
Ngaluunggirr!

47:42.519 --> 47:44.558
Ngaluunggirr.

47:46.039 --> 47:48.198
Oi, shut up!

47:49.799 --> 47:51.420
Are you having a wank?

47:52.599 --> 47:54.555
Keep it down, mate. My girlfriend...

47:56.519 --> 47:59.099
Hey, you know if you need a sick
day, all you've got to do is ask.

47:59.619 --> 48:01.645
This girl keeps calling me!

48:02.119 --> 48:06.238
Bro, what's going on?
You're starting to weird me out.

48:06.239 --> 48:08.318
- Don't you hear that?
- Hear what, bruz?

48:08.319 --> 48:09.799
The voice!

48:10.799 --> 48:12.024
The voice?

48:14.959 --> 48:16.423
I've got to find her.

48:16.839 --> 48:19.078
Hey! Find who?

48:19.079 --> 48:20.798
- Come on!
- Where are we going?

48:20.799 --> 48:23.999
- I don't know!
- OK. I'm driving.

48:25.519 --> 48:26.999
Go left.

48:29.479 --> 48:31.958
- Bloody speed bumps.
- Left, left! Left!

48:31.959 --> 48:34.318
- Are you sure, bruz?
- Yes, left!

48:34.871 --> 48:36.038
- Stop.
- What, stop?

48:36.039 --> 48:37.799
Stop!

48:39.519 --> 48:40.998
- Right.
- Sure?

48:40.999 --> 48:43.018
- Right!
- OK, I'm going right!

48:43.759 --> 48:45.958
Right again, right again.

48:45.959 --> 48:48.439
- It's a car park, man.
- Go down!

48:49.519 --> 48:51.678
- Go, go, go, go!
- Going down, man.

48:51.679 --> 48:54.678
Trust me, Blair, she is here.

48:54.679 --> 48:56.210
Stop, stop.

48:56.719 --> 48:58.199
Ngaluunggirr.

48:59.839 --> 49:01.398
- Here?
- This way.

49:01.399 --> 49:03.479
Oi, bro, you alright?

49:09.879 --> 49:11.359
Ngaluunggirr.

49:12.359 --> 49:15.958
- She's in this building.
- Did she happen to say which floor?

49:15.959 --> 49:19.038
- Top floor.
- No.9, my lucky number!

49:19.039 --> 49:20.518
Ngaluunggirr!

49:20.519 --> 49:21.999
Oi!

49:26.879 --> 49:28.359
Here.

49:35.559 --> 49:37.358
Come on. There's nothing here!

49:37.359 --> 49:39.678
It IS here! It has to be.

49:39.679 --> 49:41.159
Ngaluunggirr.

49:44.639 --> 49:46.119
This way.

49:59.119 --> 50:00.718
Ngaluunggirr!

50:01.378 --> 50:02.518
Who let you in here?

50:02.519 --> 50:05.718
Uh, hi. We're just here
from cleaning services.

50:05.719 --> 50:09.558
We're, um, here to look around,
give you an obligation-free quote.

50:09.559 --> 50:11.798
- You need to leave now.
- Excuse me?

50:11.799 --> 50:15.918
- You need to leave now.
- It's three o'clock. We had a...

50:15.919 --> 50:17.518
Jesus! Koen, what are you...?!

50:17.519 --> 50:19.159
Where is she?

50:20.879 --> 50:21.864
She in there?

50:22.650 --> 50:24.073
Blair, get the door.

50:26.553 --> 50:27.759
OK.

50:28.799 --> 50:30.398
Please.

50:30.399 --> 50:31.335
It's locked.

50:31.879 --> 50:33.358
Ngaluunggirr.

50:33.688 --> 50:35.239
No, please don't.

50:37.039 --> 50:38.679
What are you...?

50:41.039 --> 50:42.555
What is this place?

50:44.399 --> 50:47.999
- Oi! What are you doing to her?
- OK. Please.

50:54.144 --> 50:56.144
_

50:59.429 --> 51:01.429
_

51:05.994 --> 51:07.994
_

51:16.639 --> 51:19.135
Bro, we got to get out of here!

51:20.279 --> 51:21.438
Let's go.

51:21.439 --> 51:23.384
You're coming with me.

51:39.279 --> 51:41.079
- You in?
- I got her, I got her.

52:00.799 --> 52:02.279
Go!

Hey, hey, wait,
I know the code for the door.

52:26.679 --> 52:29.198
- Leave it!
- Come on, brother, let us out.

52:29.199 --> 52:31.078
Why'd you call me?

52:31.079 --> 52:33.878
I did what you asked, I broke you
out of that weird-shit lab.

52:33.879 --> 52:35.398
Talk to me!

52:35.399 --> 52:37.838
Any progress
on the break-and-entry in the lab?

52:37.839 --> 52:42.038
Facial recognition
threw up a Koen West. He runs a bar.

52:42.039 --> 52:44.118
- West?
- Yeah. They're brothers.

52:44.119 --> 52:46.718
- You knew my uncle?
- I did, through the art scene.

52:46.719 --> 52:49.198
- Why were you at his funeral?
- I was a friend.

52:49.199 --> 52:51.718
- He never mentioned you.
- Maybe you weren't listening.

52:51.719 --> 52:53.199
Go to hell.
