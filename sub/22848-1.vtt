00:24.149 --> 00:27.736
[Lindsay] Oh, yeah, I think so.
You wanna have sex with it?

00:27.819 --> 00:29.070
Yeah, but with it?

00:29.154 --> 00:32.574
I was thinking in it,
but we could have sex with it.

00:32.657 --> 00:34.451
-[Lindsay] We can do it inside.
-That could be cool.

-Hey.

Harrison, would you put up the piñata
in about 20 minutes?

00:41.416 --> 00:43.001
Will I? Is that a question?

00:43.084 --> 00:45.462
-You signed up for the piñata.
-Baker!

00:45.545 --> 00:46.963
-Don't try to weasel out of it.
-Be gentle.

-They're smaller than you.

-Hi.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.308
Have you seen a package?

03:03.892 --> 03:06.978
Mmm, no. I put the mail on the counter.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.565
There was no box or anything?

03:11.691 --> 03:12.901
I don't think so.

03:22.493 --> 03:27.290
That's really weird. 'Cause I got, like,
one of those alert things.

03:27.373 --> 03:29.459
Maybe it was delivered
to the neighbors' house.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.668
Yeah, I think so.

03:34.213 --> 03:35.673
Are you hungry?

03:36.257 --> 03:38.718
[Whitman] I don't know.

03:38.801 --> 03:40.929
-Harrison, is everything okay?
-[Harrison] Uh--

03:42.388 --> 03:46.267
Yeah, I think so.
I'm just missing a package.

03:47.143 --> 03:49.062
-You're missing a what?
-A package.

03:49.145 --> 03:54.400
I ordered a book, and they
sent me a text alert that it had arrived.

03:54.484 --> 03:56.486
-And it's not there.
-[Whitman] That's weird.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.905
-I'm thinking they--
-Good to see ya.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.199
We had a package go missing the other day.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.575
-Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:02.659 --> 04:06.079
I was just thinking it was just, like,
they probably dropped it off

04:06.162 --> 04:08.665
at the next-door neighbors'
or something--

04:08.748 --> 04:13.253
That's interesting. I heard Helen
down the street had a package go missing.

04:13.336 --> 04:18.007
I have seen security videos of people
that go into apartment buildings

04:18.091 --> 04:21.094
-and grab packages and take off.
-You think someone stole it?

04:21.177 --> 04:22.637
I don't know if somebody stole yours.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.599
Or ours. That's not what I am saying.
I'm just saying people do that.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.227
-[Harrison] So it's possible?
-It is possible, yeah.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.436
It didn't occur to me.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.522
But it makes sense. [chuckles]
They're just sitting there.

04:32.605 --> 04:35.483
-You know, we've got one of those...
-All right.

04:35.566 --> 04:38.152
nest cameras. I'll point it at my door.
Maybe something--

04:38.236 --> 04:39.320
-Okay.
-it will catch something.

04:39.404 --> 04:42.865
-Let me know if you turn anything up.
-Yeah, sure.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.951
-[Whitman] I hope you find it.
-Good night, guys.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.701
-Whoa!
-I don't know.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.913
-What? He looks Hispanic.
-[Whitman] You can't tell from that.

06:11.996 --> 06:13.498
You can't tell that.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.375
That's not what--
I'm not trying to racial profile.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.212
-I'm just saying...
-[Annie] We're not saying you are.

06:19.295 --> 06:21.631
-[Mike] but that's how you reacted.
-Oh, no, no. no.

06:21.714 --> 06:24.258
Fred and Ricardo are some of my best guys.
They're Hispanic.

06:24.342 --> 06:28.596
Yeah, I think it's a little blurry.
I'm not 100% sure.

06:28.679 --> 06:30.181
What can you tell about that?

06:31.182 --> 06:35.144
Okay, so we take a still from this
and then put something above,

06:35.228 --> 06:36.938
like, "We're watching you!"

06:37.021 --> 06:39.023
-Put it above the sign.
-[Annie] That's a great idea.

06:39.107 --> 06:40.316
We put it on everybody's door.

06:40.399 --> 06:42.235
[Whitman] That way,
if he comes to the door,

06:42.318 --> 06:44.654
he knows that we know what he's doing.

06:44.737 --> 06:48.407
You can't get away with this.
Because we are a community. And--

06:48.491 --> 06:50.743
You wouldn't feel like that?
If you were gonna steal a package

06:50.827 --> 06:53.121
and you went up to the door
and saw a picture of yourself?

06:53.204 --> 06:55.540
I'm here during the day a lot,
so if I see anything sketchy,

06:55.623 --> 06:57.083
I will call 911 in a second.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.502
Yeah, or we could maybe just try

06:59.585 --> 07:03.965
supporting our local businesses more
and stop ordering packages online.

07:04.048 --> 07:08.261
Are you kidding? No. Yes.
Maybe. Half-half. Half, right?

07:08.344 --> 07:12.432
I'm just saying they're packages,
and they're from Amazon or wherever.

07:12.515 --> 07:15.810
I know.
But some of these packages are expensive,

07:15.893 --> 07:17.437
like the pesticides I get.

07:17.520 --> 07:19.647
-If he steals that--
-I totally get it. But the guy's not--

07:19.730 --> 07:21.315
and does something with it,
I'm on the hook.

07:21.399 --> 07:23.901
It's not about the package itself
or the contents.

07:23.985 --> 07:25.862
We're a community.
There are children here.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.322
It starts with packages.
I just feel unsafe.

07:28.406 --> 07:29.740
We don't want a witch hunt.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.701
[Annie] We don't wanna hurt anyone.

07:31.784 --> 07:34.954
I don't want you to think
we're not shopping locally.

07:35.037 --> 07:37.331
[Lindsay] I don't care if you guys
are shopping locally.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.417
-I was not--
-[Whitman] The hardware store--

07:39.500 --> 07:41.544
What I was trying
to say was there's more--

07:41.627 --> 07:44.547
I'm keeping them in business
with all the work I'm doing in the yard.

07:44.630 --> 07:47.550
[Lindsay] Okay. It's fine.
I'm just saying--

07:47.633 --> 07:50.970
I'm just saying, I don't think
we should get too carried away.

07:51.554 --> 07:54.307
We'll start with flyers,
which seems like a small step.

07:54.390 --> 07:56.559
Why don't we start with everyone
getting a machine gun?

07:57.185 --> 07:58.769
And if we wanna go there, let's just--

07:58.853 --> 08:01.939
We can't order it online,
'cause clearly we'll never get it.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.524
What if the flyers say,

08:03.608 --> 08:08.654
"We're sorry that your life has gone
down a path where you have to steal.

08:08.738 --> 08:12.033
And we hope
that things turn out better for you."

08:12.116 --> 08:14.577
It's very small font.
That's a lot of words.

08:17.830 --> 08:21.459
-All right. It's gonna work.
-Hmm.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.171
It's creepy.

08:26.339 --> 08:32.345
If I was walking down the street
and I saw all of those creepy flyers,

08:32.428 --> 08:35.306
I wouldn't like anyone that lived
in the neighborhood,

08:35.389 --> 08:36.891
and I wouldn't wanna live here.

08:36.974 --> 08:42.146
And I just think
that it's bad neighborhood karma

08:42.230 --> 08:44.982
that we're putting out there.
And it's unnecessary.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.734
-That's all I'm saying
-I hear you.

08:46.817 --> 08:48.277
You like the flyers.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.905
-No, I don't like the flyers.
-Oh, you don’t.

08:50.988 --> 08:55.368
I thought you liked the flyers.
Now I realize you don't like the flyers.

08:55.451 --> 08:56.577
I'm serious.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.955
Yeah, you mentioned it.
I get it. I got it.

08:59.580 --> 09:01.332
I don't like that you like them.

09:01.415 --> 09:05.127
You know what?
I don't even know if I like them anymore.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.422
What I know is that I had an idea and--

09:09.173 --> 09:11.092
you just, like--

09:11.801 --> 09:14.887
felt compelled
to offer your opinion about it.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.014
And, you know, just let it be.

09:17.098 --> 09:21.185
Just let me do my thing.
Let me get the flyers up, see if it works.

09:22.019 --> 09:24.772
-Okay, dude, I'll let you do your thing.
-[laughs]

09:27.525 --> 09:28.985

09:29.068 --> 09:30.861
This is important to you?

09:30.945 --> 09:32.655
You're gonna make a thing of this?

09:35.283 --> 09:36.325
I'm not mad.

11:01.452 --> 11:05.373

[music playing over radio]

-It's enough to start an investigation.
-Definitely.

11:31.690 --> 11:33.526
[Harrison] Where's the first place
you saw him?

11:33.609 --> 11:34.860
[Mike] I saw him there

11:34.944 --> 11:37.154
and then tried to follow him
'cause he went out of my sight.

11:37.238 --> 11:41.367
I went around the house. When I came out,
he was coming down from the porch.

11:41.450 --> 11:43.869
Right. And when you shouted, he ran?

11:43.953 --> 11:46.997
-Yeah, but I was--
-Will you e-mail me these photographs?

11:47.081 --> 11:48.874
-Did he look at you?
-[Mike] No. No.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.709
[Harrison] When you shouted,
he didn't look at you?

11:50.793 --> 11:52.253
He did this. And then--

11:52.336 --> 11:54.630
-What's happening?
-Will you e-mail them?

11:54.714 --> 11:57.299
-He caught the guy. Yeah.
-I think I caught the guy.

11:57.383 --> 12:00.553
-If this is the guy--
-It's absolutely the same guy.

12:00.636 --> 12:04.765
-And he was so brave. He just chased him.
-Anyone would've done it.

12:04.849 --> 12:06.434
Will you e-mail me these?

12:06.517 --> 12:09.145
Marsha does the newsletter. I want her
to send them out to everyone.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.230
Yeah. I'll do that.

12:11.313 --> 12:12.565
I wish I would have been here to help.

12:12.648 --> 12:16.569
That's the house
that he was stealing from?

12:16.652 --> 12:18.821
That was the one
that didn't have the flyers.

12:18.904 --> 12:21.282
That was the guy
who didn't put up the flyers.

12:21.365 --> 12:25.077
Well, I'm sure he saw the other flyers
on every other house.

12:25.161 --> 12:28.706
-But that's still pretty ballsy.
-But if the one house--

12:28.789 --> 12:31.959
He wears New Balance.
He's definitely a runner.

13:02.490 --> 13:06.285
Come on! Where's the speed?
Think on your feet!

13:06.368 --> 13:08.037
Make it quick.
I'm in the middle of practice.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.164
The parents voted to make
the workshop mandatory.

13:10.247 --> 13:12.166
I can't think of anyone at this school

13:12.249 --> 13:14.251
that could benefit more
from sensitivity training than you.

13:14.335 --> 13:16.670
Tell 'em to talk to me
if they have a problem.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.048
-[man]  They're all afraid of you.
-[coach]  Good.

13:19.131 --> 13:21.425
Why did we start a group text
if not for this?

13:22.009 --> 13:25.971
I mean, it seems like the perfect example
of when you should send a group text.

13:26.055 --> 13:28.390
[Annie] I don't wanna alarm everyone.
It's late.

13:28.474 --> 13:31.060
I don't wanna alarm anybody either,
but they’ve been there for--

13:31.602 --> 13:34.313
What are they doing?
They've been there for ten minutes.

13:34.396 --> 13:37.942
And it is late. You're right.
Hmm, I don't know.

13:38.025 --> 13:41.737
I'm gonna text 'em. I'm gonna text 'em.
Just better safe than sorry.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.322
Okay.

13:48.035 --> 13:49.203
[indistinct chatter on TV]

13:49.286 --> 13:52.623
[Lindsay] No. No-phone zone.

13:53.624 --> 13:55.125
-Oh!
-[chuckles]

13:56.460 --> 13:59.088
-Sorry.
-Yeah. It's cool. It's okay.

14:00.089 --> 14:03.634
"Suspicious car on the street.
Two guys inside."

14:04.093 --> 14:07.763
It's the neighborhood watch group text.

14:10.641 --> 14:11.767
[Annie] What are people saying?

14:11.850 --> 14:15.312
I think we should go out as a group.
I'm gonna ask them.

14:15.396 --> 14:20.025
A united front. More like,
"You can't mess with us. We're a team."

14:20.109 --> 14:21.569
-Yeah.
-Okay.

14:22.278 --> 14:24.864
"Can we all go out together?"

14:25.781 --> 14:28.659
Whitman's saying,
"Looks like the package thief.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.454
We should go out and confront as a group."

14:34.081 --> 14:36.292
Confront them about what?

14:38.502 --> 14:40.087
-No, that's weird.
-I'm gonna take a look.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.964
-No.
-I think it's interesting.

14:42.673 --> 14:46.302
It's not interesting. People are allowed
to be in their cars on streets.

14:47.511 --> 14:48.596
I'm checking it out.

14:55.519 --> 14:59.148
So that's the car. They said
it was in front of the Brentons'.

14:59.231 --> 15:03.277
Great. It's a car with people in it.
There's nothing weird about that.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.196
No, what's weird is that it's parked
on the street,

15:06.280 --> 15:08.574
and nobody on this block parks
on the street.

15:08.657 --> 15:10.242
They park in their driveway, their garage.

15:10.326 --> 15:13.704
Well, it could be two people
having an argument

15:13.787 --> 15:16.582
-before they go into someone else's house.
-Are we gonna play this game?

15:16.665 --> 15:19.668
-It could be teenagers getting stoned.
-Are we writing fiction?

15:19.752 --> 15:21.629
-That's all I did for five years.
-It could be old ladies talking

15:21.712 --> 15:23.047
about baskets they're weaving,

15:23.130 --> 15:26.133
but it could be a terrorist
or somebody casing the block.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.302
-A terrorist?
-I'm not saying it's a terrorist.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.219
We don't know what it is.

15:29.303 --> 15:32.765
-What are we doing? We're just gonna wait?
-Oh, fuck, Mike.

15:32.848 --> 15:34.558
[whispers] What is Mike doing?

15:34.642 --> 15:37.269
I don't know. We didn't get a consensus
on the group text.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.562
[Lindsay] What is he doing?

15:39.271 --> 15:42.733
-He's probably asking what they're doing.
-Oh, my God!

15:42.816 --> 15:45.069
That's crazy. This is your guys' fault.

15:45.152 --> 15:47.363
-He thinks he's some hero.
-What's crazy about it?

15:47.446 --> 15:49.490
If they're not doing anything wrong--

15:49.573 --> 15:52.451
Sorry to bother you, guys.
Are you lost? Can I help you?

15:52.534 --> 15:54.578
-[boy 1] No, we're cool, man.
-[boy 2] Yeah, we good.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.498
-What are you guys doing?
-[boy 1] Just chillin', man.

15:57.581 --> 16:01.126
-[boy 2] Enjoying the night.
-Do you guys live around here, or--

16:01.210 --> 16:02.795
[boy 1] Right around the corner.

16:02.878 --> 16:06.215
-[Whitman] I'm gonna back him up.
-No, don't go out there. Christopher!

16:06.298 --> 16:09.093
I'm just gonna talk to 'em
and make sure that Mike's okay.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.178
-It's fine.
-Bring something to protect yourself.

16:11.261 --> 16:14.348
-Babe, I don't need anything.
-These people could be crazy.

16:14.431 --> 16:15.724
What's gonna happen?

16:15.808 --> 16:17.935
We're just gonna talk. It's gonna be fine.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.144
Please be safe.

16:19.228 --> 16:23.649
-It's gonna be fine, babe. Don't worry.
-[sighs] I don't like this.

16:24.566 --> 16:26.026
How do you know he's harassing them?

16:26.110 --> 16:28.445
-You don't know what he's saying.
-Look at his body language.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.531
Now Whitman's coming out. What the fuck?

16:30.614 --> 16:32.408
I'm a concerned citizen.
I live on the block.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.492
-We've just--
-[Whitman] Hey, Mike?

16:33.575 --> 16:35.077
-Yeah?
-Everything okay?

16:35.160 --> 16:40.416
Yeah. I think so. Just two kids
smoking reefer and hanging out, I guess.

16:40.499 --> 16:43.961
Why are you guys here?
Why did you guys stop on this block?

16:44.044 --> 16:45.921
[boy 1] What's with all the questions?

16:46.005 --> 16:50.134
Like I said, we've had some problems
with disappearing packages and--

16:50.217 --> 16:53.846
-[boy 1] So you accuse us?
-No, I just don't recognize the car.

16:53.929 --> 16:56.515
I didn't recognize you,
and you're not answering the questions.

16:56.598 --> 16:59.393
-Hey! Hey! Hey!
-[boy 1] Oh, my fucking God!

16:59.476 --> 17:02.271
-Ah, shit! What the fuck?
-[Whitman] Stay in the car.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.772
[boy 1] Ah, fuck, man!

17:03.856 --> 17:08.027
-Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
-Fuck. Do you have your phone?

17:08.110 --> 17:09.361
[Whitman] Did you mace them?

17:09.445 --> 17:11.572
I'm sorry!
You should have stayed in the car.

17:11.655 --> 17:14.324
-Sit down. Jesus Christ.
-I don't wanna sit down.

17:14.408 --> 17:18.328
-Well, back up. Just back up. Come on.
-[boys coughing]

17:18.412 --> 17:20.581
-Fine. God!
-[boy 2] Fuck you!

17:20.664 --> 17:24.043
-The kid came at me.
-[officer 1] Take it easy.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.878
[indistinct chatter on police radio]

17:25.961 --> 17:27.796
-[officer 1] Guys, settle down.
-[boy 2] Fuck you!

17:27.880 --> 17:29.965
[officer 2] I got it. I got this.

17:30.049 --> 17:33.552
-Is it legal for a man to carry mace?
-I'm gonna press charges.

17:33.635 --> 17:36.930
What I want to know is are you willing
to sign complaints?

17:37.014 --> 17:38.057
-Yes.
-Of course.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.225
-[officer 2] Okay. Everybody--
-[boy 1] I can't open my eyes!

17:40.309 --> 17:42.519
I gotta talk to Whitman by himself.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.313
-Separately.
-Okay. That's fine.

17:44.396 --> 17:45.814
-Will you come find me?
-Yeah.

17:45.898 --> 17:48.942
-Do me a favor. Get to the sidewalk.
-[boy 1] No shit, Sherlock.

17:49.026 --> 17:53.489
Whitman, don't worry about these guys.
I need you to talk to me separately.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.492
Take it nice and slow, from the beginning.
What happened?

17:56.575 --> 18:00.996
Okay. So we saw this car here
maybe a half an hour or so.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.998
We thought that was suspicious.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.834
-We have a group text--
-[boy 2 groaning]

18:05.918 --> 18:07.211
--for suspicious things
in the neighborhood.

18:07.294 --> 18:08.670
Ah, my fuckin' eye.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.924
-This is crazy.
-Yeah, it's totally crazy.

18:12.591 --> 18:16.470
I think this completely sucks.
And this is our fault.

18:17.387 --> 18:20.015
-This is what I was talking about.
-I know.

18:20.099 --> 18:22.935
With the flyers and group texting
and paranoia.

18:23.018 --> 18:27.981
You guys watching people out your windows.
And it's all unnecessary.

18:28.440 --> 18:29.566
People are hurt.

18:31.193 --> 18:35.405
This is totally out of hand, you guys.
It doesn't make any sense.

18:35.489 --> 18:37.741
Three weeks ago, we were having fun,
enjoying ourselves.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.952
We live on a safe block.

18:40.035 --> 18:41.954
There are ambulances here now.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.289
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I need your statement.

18:44.373 --> 18:46.750
Guys, please,
hit the sidewalk for me, okay?

18:46.834 --> 18:48.836
[indistinct chatter on police radio]

18:51.839 --> 18:53.132
[woman] Is there anything we need to know?

19:25.914 --> 19:27.166
[sighs]

20:18.008 --> 20:19.509
[Harrison] It looks really good out here.

20:19.593 --> 20:21.637
-Ooh-ooh!
-What?

20:21.720 --> 20:23.096
Ew!

20:24.181 --> 20:26.225
-Oh, wow. Oh, my God!
-[shouts]

20:27.226 --> 20:30.562
-[Lindsay] Should I leave him in there?
-I don't know. You're the expert.

20:31.355 --> 20:33.941
-He's my wormy friend.
-He might die in there.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.946
-Right? How long you think he'll live?
-[car door closes]

21:05.931 --> 21:07.683
[lawn mower engine starts]

21:38.130 --> 21:39.131
Can I--

21:39.214 --> 21:40.424
Hey!

21:40.507 --> 21:41.758
Harry! Hey!

21:43.051 --> 21:44.052
Hey!

21:44.845 --> 21:45.846
Hey!

21:46.638 --> 21:48.849
-Somebody! Help!
-Hey!

21:50.017 --> 21:51.435
-[Lindsay] That's him!
-Stop!

21:51.518 --> 21:53.270
-Stop right there!
-Call the police!

22:10.537 --> 22:11.955
Hey. Hey! Hey!

22:12.039 --> 22:13.040
Shit!

22:15.292 --> 22:16.293
[Lindsay] I got him.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.588
[grunts]

22:21.923 --> 22:24.426
Uh, yeah. We need someone quick.

22:24.509 --> 22:25.886
We caught a thief.

22:25.969 --> 22:27.387
Is everyone okay?

22:27.471 --> 22:29.765
Uh, 10028 Seelie Street.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.266
[Harrison] Are you okay?

22:31.349 --> 22:32.601
-You okay?
-[Mike] Uh,

22:32.684 --> 22:35.312
I don't know. 5'5"-- 5'8", 5'9", 175.

22:35.395 --> 22:37.773
-[coughing]
-Maybe he's Hispanic. I don't know.

22:37.856 --> 22:39.107
[panting]

22:39.191 --> 22:40.192
[Whitman] Got you.

22:40.859 --> 22:43.737
[Mike] No, it's happening right now.
It's happening right now.

22:43.820 --> 22:44.946
Oh, God.

23:23.485 --> 23:24.736
[Lindsay groans]

23:52.931 --> 23:55.600
[Whitman] Uh, Doug said
that if he doesn't take a plea deal,

23:55.684 --> 23:57.561
uh, we need to be open to testifying.

23:57.644 --> 23:59.855
[Mike] Really? So we may have to go in?

23:59.938 --> 24:01.606
[Whitman] We might need to clear
our schedules, go in.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.733
-[Mike] Wow.
-[Annie] How soon will that happen?

24:04.484 --> 24:06.862
-Next month?
-In a few weeks.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.072
They probably have a lot of cases.

24:09.156 --> 24:11.199
Coffee klatch over there.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.076
-The umbrella summit.
-[Mike] I like that.

24:13.160 --> 24:15.996
-[Annie] I don't wanna make a case.
-Drew Baker. Blueberry Brubaker case?

24:16.079 --> 24:19.040
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-[Annie] That's a great idea.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.501
-Hey. Hey, guys!
-Hi!

24:21.585 --> 24:23.503
[Whitman] How you doing, tough guy?
You good?

24:24.713 --> 24:26.047
Yeah, I'm good.

24:26.131 --> 24:28.175
[Whitman] Harry,
you better watch out for her.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.759
-Yeah.
-You better watch out.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.345
-[Harrison] All right. Have a good day.
-Thank you.

24:33.054 --> 24:34.681
You're like Urlacher.

24:36.474 --> 24:37.475
[Mancow on radio]  Where, Al?

24:37.559 --> 24:39.186
[Al Roker]  South Side,
nice neighborhood.

24:39.269 --> 24:40.645
[Cathy]  Oh, really nice.

24:40.729 --> 24:43.106
[Mancow]  South Side Chicago,
this area called Beverly,

24:43.190 --> 24:47.027
this woman got fed up
with people taking packages

24:47.110 --> 24:48.695
-off her and her neighbors' porch.
-[Cathy groans]

24:48.778 --> 24:51.323
She confronted the person.
There was a smackdown.

24:51.406 --> 24:54.117
-Now, the PC police are all over her.
- [Cathy]  Oh, no.

24:54.201 --> 24:56.661
[Mancow]  She's my hero.
I'm sending her a Mancow shirt.

24:56.745 --> 25:00.373
I want her to wear it loud and proud.
She is our hero of the day.

25:00.457 --> 25:01.458
[Cathy]  Absolutely.

25:01.541 --> 25:04.252
[Mancow]  The package vigilante of Beverly.
Let's hear it for her!

25:04.336 --> 25:07.589
-[Cathy]  Yes!
- [Mancow]  It's a celebration up in here!
