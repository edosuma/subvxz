00:04.420 --> 00:05.330
Andi:
 Previously, on Andi Mack...

00:05.330 --> 00:08.080
Both:
Jonah and Amber broke up!

00:08.080 --> 00:09.960
Jonah:
I need to talk to you. Andi--

00:09.960 --> 00:11.540
-Andi!
-Who's that?

00:11.540 --> 00:13.290
It doesn't matter.
What were you gonna say?

00:13.290 --> 00:15.540
I'll tell you later.

00:15.540 --> 00:17.750
-Okay.
-Here she is. My kid!

00:17.750 --> 00:19.460
-You met your dad?
-Your dad?

00:19.460 --> 00:20.670
What's he like?

00:20.670 --> 00:22.120
He's a really cool guy.

00:22.120 --> 00:24.250
You and me are on, like,
the same brain-length.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.290
Andi: I didn't know what
was gonna happen next,

00:26.290 --> 00:28.170
but I knew
 that it would be fun.

00:28.170 --> 00:30.920
But, then he had to go,
 and now he's gone.

00:30.920 --> 00:32.790
And Jonah's back with Amber,

00:32.790 --> 00:34.040
so he's gone, too.

00:34.040 --> 00:35.420
They're both gone.

00:35.420 --> 00:37.580
Your life just
keeps getting crazier.

00:37.580 --> 00:38.790
Both:
Aah!

00:38.790 --> 00:40.670
Hey! I love your guest house!

00:40.670 --> 00:42.170
-What is he doing?
-(laughs)

00:48.330 --> 00:49.420
What? No.

00:49.420 --> 00:50.540
No-- Mom, come on.

00:50.540 --> 00:52.540
-(sighs)
-Stay.

00:52.540 --> 00:55.380
Mrs. Mack, y-- you can't pretend
I don't exist.

00:56.920 --> 00:59.120
I stand corrected.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.670
He's not supposed
to be here.

01:00.670 --> 01:02.960
You're right, I'm not
supposed to be here.

01:02.960 --> 01:06.080
I should be on a bus,
starting a 40-city tour

01:06.080 --> 01:08.710
with a band that could
finally make my career.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.420
Or not.

01:12.420 --> 01:15.460
But, that dream was
all that mattered to me.

01:16.750 --> 01:18.210
Until today.

01:23.120 --> 01:25.170
Now I have this.

01:25.170 --> 01:26.460
A new phone?

01:26.460 --> 01:29.000
Mom, look at the screen.

01:35.380 --> 01:36.920
Can you send this to me?

01:38.460 --> 01:40.250
You understand my problem.

01:42.380 --> 01:44.830
This girl versus Memphis?

01:44.830 --> 01:46.380
Wasn't even a contest.

01:46.380 --> 01:49.420
So you're stickin' around,
that's what you're sayin'?

01:49.420 --> 01:50.790
That's the plan, Ham.

01:50.790 --> 01:52.670
He's staying in AndiShack.

01:52.670 --> 01:54.540
Or?

01:54.540 --> 01:55.710
There is no "or."

01:55.710 --> 01:56.750
Or?

01:56.750 --> 01:58.580
He can sleep on the couch.

01:58.580 --> 02:00.830
Not the "or" I was looking for.

02:00.830 --> 02:02.380
It's just for a few days.

02:02.380 --> 02:04.580
Three. And then
I'll rejoin my tour.

02:04.580 --> 02:06.290
Uh, four at the most.

02:08.289 --> 02:09.919
I can give you one.

02:17.830 --> 02:20.330
Two, and that's it.

02:20.330 --> 02:21.500
And you can all stop
looking at me

02:21.500 --> 02:23.500
like I gave you
socks for Christmas.

02:23.500 --> 02:26.420
(laughs)
Thank you, Mrs. Mack.

02:26.420 --> 02:27.750
You're welcome.

02:27.750 --> 02:31.330
You've got... 48 hours,
starting now.

02:39.620 --> 02:42.420
-Score! -It's better
than I was expecting!

02:42.420 --> 02:46.500

Have you talked to Jonah
since yesterday?

03:42.120 --> 03:45.210
Yeah, we had a deep
and meaningful conversation.

03:45.210 --> 03:48.460
I said, "Hey!"
and he said, "Yo!"

03:48.460 --> 03:49.960
I guess I'm never gonna know

03:49.960 --> 03:51.670
what he was gonna ask me.

03:51.670 --> 03:53.120
Sure you will.

03:53.120 --> 03:54.210
Whatever that question was,

03:54.210 --> 03:56.500
he is eventually going
to ask it.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.250
Do you really think so?

03:58.250 --> 03:59.580
Definitely.

03:59.580 --> 04:00.880
Like, 20 years from now,

04:00.880 --> 04:02.120
you'll be
at a high school reunion,

04:02.120 --> 04:03.670
and you'll say, "Hey, Jonah,

04:03.670 --> 04:04.750
"what was that question

04:04.750 --> 04:05.880
you were gonna ask me that day?"

04:05.880 --> 04:07.670
And he'll tell you,
and you'll both laugh

04:07.670 --> 04:09.250
about how different
your lives would've been

04:09.250 --> 04:10.500
if he had asked it
back then.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.710
Is that supposed
to make me feel better?

04:12.710 --> 04:15.750
Maybe this will: Future
you is gonna get a ride

04:15.750 --> 04:18.380
in Future me's
private helicopter.

04:19.959 --> 04:21.380
I should get over there.

04:21.380 --> 04:22.670
This is it right here. Game
time, baby, game time.

04:22.670 --> 04:24.040
Do you know what I mean?

04:24.040 --> 04:26.380
What is he doing here?

04:26.380 --> 04:28.420
What is who doing where?

04:28.420 --> 04:30.210
We're Space Otters.

04:30.210 --> 04:32.330
-Give it to--
-What are you doing here?

04:32.330 --> 04:34.080
He's our new coach.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.330
Coach?

04:35.330 --> 04:37.420
I'm not a coach. I just
came here to see you play.

04:37.420 --> 04:41.500
-Bex told me you had a game, but Jonah and
I got talkin'. -(both mimic explosion)

04:41.500 --> 04:44.500
(laughs)
You two know each other?

04:44.500 --> 04:48.250
Um, yeah.
He's my dad.

04:48.250 --> 04:50.420
Y-- Y-- Your dad?

04:50.420 --> 04:52.330
Yeah, I should've
mentioned that.

04:52.330 --> 04:54.290
We got caught up
talkin' plays.

04:54.290 --> 04:57.670
He's new, and he didn't
come with instructions.

04:58.790 --> 05:00.290
Cover blown.

05:00.290 --> 05:01.420
Sorry, guys.

05:02.670 --> 05:04.880
I didn't know you were
a disc head.

05:04.880 --> 05:06.330
I me-- me, too!

05:06.330 --> 05:08.250
It blows my mind
how much we have in common.

05:08.250 --> 05:11.670
I know. Me, too,
but you can't stay.

05:11.670 --> 05:13.620
What? Why not?

05:13.620 --> 05:16.670
You'd be the only one. Parents
don't come to our games.

05:16.670 --> 05:19.420
Nobody comes to our games.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.710
(clears throat)

05:20.710 --> 05:22.500
Except Cyrus.

05:22.500 --> 05:23.620
This is my dad.

05:23.620 --> 05:24.750
Bowie.

05:24.750 --> 05:26.620
It is very exciting to meet you.

05:26.620 --> 05:28.500
(laughs)
I like your vest.

05:28.500 --> 05:30.500
You wouldn't if you
were wearing it.

05:30.500 --> 05:33.540
It weighs 20 pounds,
but I wear it with pride

05:33.540 --> 05:36.080
as the only official fan
of the Space Otters.

05:37.460 --> 05:38.710
Is this the guy?

05:38.710 --> 05:39.830
What guy?

05:39.830 --> 05:41.080
The one you
had to see yesterday?

05:41.080 --> 05:42.460
When you made me
drop you back off at school?

05:42.460 --> 05:44.380
-(laughs) Cyrus? -Yeah.

05:44.380 --> 05:45.540
No.

05:45.540 --> 05:47.250
Will you point him out
to be me if he's around?

05:47.250 --> 05:48.460
I will not.

05:48.460 --> 05:52.460
-Let's go, guys!
-All: Whoooo!

05:52.460 --> 05:53.380
Let's go, Andiman.

05:53.380 --> 05:54.420
(both laughing)

05:54.420 --> 05:56.420
You're stickin'
around, right?

05:56.420 --> 05:58.420
You bet!

05:58.420 --> 06:02.040
But I won't cheer.
I will be very quiet.

06:02.040 --> 06:03.750
All:
Go team!

06:03.750 --> 06:05.920
(cheering)

06:05.920 --> 06:08.210
I can't believe
that's your dad.

06:08.210 --> 06:10.080
He's docious-magocious.

06:10.080 --> 06:13.170
Well, docious, sure,
but magocious?

06:13.170 --> 06:15.830
I mean, I just met him.

06:21.420 --> 06:22.710
Something wrong?

06:22.710 --> 06:24.750
No, it's just...

06:24.750 --> 06:26.960
he records everything.

06:26.960 --> 06:29.620
Great, we'll have
our first game tape.

06:32.290 --> 06:33.960

06:52.920 --> 06:54.620
You're using
your milk shake

06:54.620 --> 06:58.960
as a dipping sauce
for your baby taters.

06:58.960 --> 07:00.500
Yup.

07:00.500 --> 07:04.040
That is... genius.

07:04.040 --> 07:06.420
-May I?
-Be my guest.

07:15.580 --> 07:17.380
Milk shake is
the new ketchup.

07:17.380 --> 07:19.540
-(laughs)
-(phone buzzes)

07:19.540 --> 07:21.290
It's from Jonah Beck.

07:21.290 --> 07:24.500
Sorry, Jonah.
Still getting used to that.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.500
What's it say?

07:26.500 --> 07:28.960
"Ur"-- "U R...

07:31.750 --> 07:33.460
Girly"?

07:33.460 --> 07:34.790
What?

07:34.790 --> 07:36.420
Let me see.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.500
That's what it says.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.670
What does that mean?

07:40.670 --> 07:42.380
I don't understand.

07:42.380 --> 07:44.170
Do you think
I'm girly?

07:44.170 --> 07:45.500
So what if you are.

07:45.500 --> 07:47.080
You do think I'm girly!

07:47.080 --> 07:50.420
-Calm down-- -Calm down?
Easy for you to say!

07:50.420 --> 07:52.710
Nobody's calling you girly.

07:52.710 --> 07:54.210
No one?

07:54.210 --> 07:56.250
-What are people saying?
-It doesn't matter.

07:56.250 --> 07:59.290
The point is,
Jonah thinks I'm girly!

07:59.290 --> 08:03.380
I wanna know. Because if there's
someone saying I'm not girly,

08:03.380 --> 08:05.000
I will end them.

08:09.380 --> 08:12.380
Don't get me wrong,
I'm glad he's here.

08:12.380 --> 08:16.290
I just wish he was a little less
full of surprises.

08:16.290 --> 08:17.830
He shows up on our doorstep.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.620
He's doing a headstand
in AndiShack.

08:20.620 --> 08:22.380
He's coaching my team.

08:22.380 --> 08:24.330
Would it kill him
to throw me a text?

08:24.330 --> 08:27.250
I admit, he's a bit
of a novelty item.

08:27.250 --> 08:28.290
It takes some getting used to.

08:28.290 --> 08:32.000
I wouldn't even care
about any of it

08:32.000 --> 08:34.419
if it wasn't so embarrassing.

08:34.419 --> 08:35.960
What does he do?

08:35.960 --> 08:39.880
He has to talk to everybody,
and he won't stop filming me.

08:39.880 --> 08:43.080
And he's asking me personal
questions about guys

08:43.080 --> 08:44.290
and if I like someone!

08:44.290 --> 08:46.880
(high-pitched, softly)
Oh. That's so annoying.

08:46.880 --> 08:50.380
You think it's cute,
but it's not cute.

08:50.380 --> 08:52.040
But it's what dads do.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.580
It's their job
to embarrass their daughters.

08:54.580 --> 08:55.830
(knocking on door)

08:55.830 --> 08:58.330
Hey, guys,
it's time for dinner.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.960
Did he ever embarrass you?

08:59.960 --> 09:01.880
Never.

09:01.880 --> 09:03.000
Never?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.120
Uh-uh.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.380
He likes to dance.

09:05.380 --> 09:07.080
That's not so bad.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.000
At my piccolo recitals.

09:09.000 --> 09:11.420
Well, that was your fault...

09:11.420 --> 09:13.040
for playing Do the Hustle.

09:13.040 --> 09:15.250
(music playing)

09:15.250 --> 09:18.330
Oh, no. I didn't know
you could embarrass someone

09:18.330 --> 09:20.500
who played the piccolo.
(laughs)

09:20.500 --> 09:21.540
Watch and learn.

09:23.460 --> 09:25.670
(laughing)

09:28.500 --> 09:31.540
Ah, dah bah, hah, hey!
(laughs)

09:31.540 --> 09:35.210
-Ooh. -Smells good.
What's for dinner?

09:35.210 --> 09:36.500
It's a surprise.

09:36.500 --> 09:40.170
But you hate surprises.

09:40.170 --> 09:42.380
Apparently, not everyone
knows that.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.290
Ham:
Oh, wow, look at that.

09:47.290 --> 09:48.830
Andi:
Wow.

09:48.830 --> 09:51.540
Is that Lop Chung?

09:51.540 --> 09:54.380
I used a recipe from that little
box behind the spice rack.

09:54.380 --> 09:56.830
Hope it's okay.

09:56.830 --> 10:00.170
Chopsticks, in case
anyone wants them.

10:00.170 --> 10:01.500
Where did you learn to cook?

10:01.500 --> 10:05.380
Oh, you know,
where anyone learns anything.

10:05.380 --> 10:07.080
Here and there.

10:11.080 --> 10:12.420
CeCe?

10:14.000 --> 10:15.620
Are you okay?

10:15.620 --> 10:18.000
Those are my mother's recipes.

10:21.790 --> 10:26.080
Oh, no-- I'm... sorry
if I overstepped my bounds.

10:27.670 --> 10:31.250
I just-- Never much of a cook,
so I never made them.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.330
Does that mean
we can't eat this?

10:37.330 --> 10:41.210
I don't know. I've never
seen this facial expression.

10:41.210 --> 10:44.330
Of course you can eat it.
I'm just feeling sentimental.

10:46.040 --> 10:48.380
Uh-- This is astounding.

10:48.380 --> 10:49.670
Y-- You'll show me
how to make this?

10:49.670 --> 10:54.170
Sure. I still got 24 hours
left on the clock, right?

10:54.170 --> 10:57.380
Clock? What clock?

11:01.330 --> 11:03.000
-Mom?
-What?

11:03.000 --> 11:04.330
I changed my mind.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.670
Pass me a pair
of chopsticks.

11:06.670 --> 11:08.960
(laughter)

11:08.960 --> 11:11.120
-Wow. All right.
-Ah!

11:11.120 --> 11:12.460
All right,
I'm having some of...

11:14.330 --> 11:16.960
Buffy:
 Okay, here's your next one.

11:16.960 --> 11:19.670
Who is the all-time
leading NBA scorer?

11:19.670 --> 11:21.710
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

11:21.710 --> 11:25.170
-Correct. -Position: center.
Height: Seven feet, two inches.

11:25.170 --> 11:26.330
Nice.

11:26.330 --> 11:27.710
Formerly known
as Lew Alcindor.

11:27.710 --> 11:29.500
Signature shot:
the skyhook.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.290
Okay, okay.

11:31.290 --> 11:32.750
There's no extra credit.

11:32.750 --> 11:35.460
This is just so you can
have a conversation with Jonah.

11:35.460 --> 11:37.580
I just wanna
be completely prepared.

11:37.580 --> 11:41.420
Right. And we still have to cover
Super Bowls, March Madness,

11:41.420 --> 11:42.830
and spring training.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.460
It's so hard to be boy-ly.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.290
You can do it, Cyrus.

11:46.290 --> 11:48.250
Just think of yourself
like Rocky.

11:48.250 --> 11:50.000
Who?

11:50.000 --> 11:52.170
Adding Rocky
 to the list.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.790
(laughs)

12:01.790 --> 12:05.380
Are we headed somewhere
or we just wandering aimlessly?

12:05.380 --> 12:08.000
'Cause I'm okay
with either.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.250
Oh, we're definitely
goin' somewhere.

12:10.250 --> 12:12.500
Back in time.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.920
Yeah, I've made that trip.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.620
Moving back home
with my parents,

12:16.620 --> 12:19.210
working for the kid
I used to babysit.

12:19.210 --> 12:22.960
Now... walkin' down the street,
with you.

12:24.460 --> 12:25.750
Do you know
where we are?

12:30.170 --> 12:31.540
Is this--

12:31.540 --> 12:33.210
The last place I saw you.

12:34.380 --> 12:36.580
The night you left town.

12:36.580 --> 12:38.380
We had a fight.

12:40.210 --> 12:42.000
(exhaling)

12:42.000 --> 12:44.170
I was worried you were gonna
do something romantic.

12:44.170 --> 12:45.210
(laughs)

12:46.420 --> 12:48.210
Can you be serious
for a second?

12:49.250 --> 12:51.290
I... don't know.

12:52.960 --> 12:59.170
Bex... I was always planning
to come back to you.

13:00.250 --> 13:03.120
If I have to be serious,
so do you.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.790
I wanted it to be
when I made it.

13:05.790 --> 13:07.000
And I never did.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.000
Join the club.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.210
Can I?

13:11.210 --> 13:12.290
What?

13:12.290 --> 13:13.670
Join the club.

13:13.670 --> 13:15.040
Yours and Andi's.

13:15.040 --> 13:18.250
Um, you're kind
of a lifetime member.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.460
I mean, like... really.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.540
I wanna be
a part of your lives.

13:24.540 --> 13:27.250
How? You're a musician.

13:27.250 --> 13:29.710
-You live on the road.
-I don't have to.

13:30.830 --> 13:32.250
I can do something else.

13:32.250 --> 13:33.380
Like what?

13:33.380 --> 13:35.380
I have to figure that out.

13:35.380 --> 13:37.460
But first, I wanna know
if you're okay with it.

13:37.460 --> 13:40.500
-I can't speak for Andi.
-I'm not asking you to.

13:40.500 --> 13:42.580
Just speak for yourself.

13:44.460 --> 13:46.210
What do you want?

13:49.170 --> 13:50.380
Honestly?

13:50.380 --> 13:53.960
Yes. Honestly.

13:55.290 --> 13:57.420
Pizza.

13:57.420 --> 13:59.380
Aren't you starving?

13:59.380 --> 14:01.080
'Cause I am.

14:01.080 --> 14:02.790
Me, too, actually.

14:06.120 --> 14:08.170
Is Vinnie's still here?

14:08.170 --> 14:11.210
Yeah, of course.
Only it's called Tony's now.

14:11.210 --> 14:12.750
-Hm, Tony's.
-Yeah.

14:12.750 --> 14:14.000
-Mm.

Okay. Handshake.

14:26.290 --> 14:28.460
Wrong handshake!

14:28.460 --> 14:30.080
Right, right, sorry.

14:30.080 --> 14:31.420
Take it from the top.

14:31.420 --> 14:32.380
Okay.

14:32.380 --> 14:34.620
Handshake.

14:34.620 --> 14:36.710
Not quite.

14:36.710 --> 14:39.330
It's fine.
Okay. Handshake.

14:39.330 --> 14:41.210
Lean in.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.540
Just the torso.

14:46.540 --> 14:48.380
Right, okay.
This is-- This is the one.

14:48.380 --> 14:49.460
I can feel it.

14:49.460 --> 14:50.500
Going again.

Handshake.

Lean in.

Wrap... and pat.

14:59.460 --> 15:01.710
How was that?

15:01.710 --> 15:04.830
If Jonah was
a glass figurine, great.

15:06.250 --> 15:08.880
Okay. Handshake.

15:26.380 --> 15:27.380
Jonah on computer:
 Boom!

15:29.420 --> 15:31.330
-Is this a bad time?
-Jonah on computer: Boom!

15:31.330 --> 15:33.120
Aaahh!

15:33.120 --> 15:34.170
Boom!

15:36.750 --> 15:38.080
Boom!

15:43.670 --> 15:45.380
What are you doing here?

15:45.380 --> 15:49.120
Your dad sent me up to get you, and
we're watching the game video!

15:49.120 --> 15:50.960
He thought you'd
wanna join us.

15:50.960 --> 15:52.380
No, thanks.

15:52.380 --> 15:53.710
Should I go?

15:53.710 --> 15:56.250
Yeah! Yes, please,
that'd be great!

16:08.420 --> 16:09.460
(thuds)

16:16.460 --> 16:18.500
He's ruining my life.

16:18.500 --> 16:20.540
He's not ruining your life.

16:20.540 --> 16:23.330
You two are just figuring out
how this works.

16:23.330 --> 16:25.210
It doesn't!

16:25.210 --> 16:29.040
Right. He can be very intense,

16:29.040 --> 16:31.120
but his heart's
in the right place.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.330
I know,
but I just need a break.

16:34.330 --> 16:38.460
I need some breathing room. I just
need to sit here and do this.

16:38.460 --> 16:39.580
(knocking on window)

16:40.670 --> 16:42.000
Hey, can I grab you
a second?

16:42.000 --> 16:45.080
I'm working on a belt
in here!

16:45.080 --> 16:46.290
Okay.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.380
Steppin' away.

16:52.750 --> 16:55.210
Well, I am working
on a belt.

17:06.210 --> 17:09.290
(whispering)
Don't wave. Do a guy nod.

17:14.710 --> 17:16.119
And don't touch your hair.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.420
(whispering)
But my forehead is lonely.

17:18.420 --> 17:20.420
You look really good.

17:20.420 --> 17:22.880
Meaning what?
I usually look bad?

17:22.880 --> 17:26.960
No, just that I did a good job.
You're my creation.

17:26.960 --> 17:28.960
Cyrus two point bro.

17:30.710 --> 17:32.620
Jonah. He just walked in.

17:35.080 --> 17:38.120
This was just supposed to be a test drive.
I'm not ready!

17:39.330 --> 17:40.500
Guy nod.

17:40.500 --> 17:42.210
-But he waved.
-Do it!

17:45.330 --> 17:46.460
He's coming over.

17:46.460 --> 17:48.290
You're on.
Make me proud.

17:50.170 --> 17:51.750
New look, Cy-Guy?

17:51.750 --> 17:55.380
You know it, Jo--
Jo-lama-jama.

17:55.380 --> 17:56.380
Uchh...

17:56.380 --> 17:58.460
(laughs)
You crack me up.

17:58.460 --> 18:02.170
And I love it when you come to the
games in that vest with all the swag.

18:02.170 --> 18:03.620
You got my text, right?

18:03.620 --> 18:06.460
Y-- You mean the one
where you said I'm girly?

18:06.460 --> 18:08.830
-What?
-Your text.

18:08.830 --> 18:13.250
You wrote...
"U R girly."

18:13.250 --> 18:17.790
That's some stupid auto-correct. It
was supposed to be "You're gnarly."

18:17.790 --> 18:19.250
I'm gnarly.

18:20.540 --> 18:22.460
-Now, when you say "gnarly"--
-You're cool, man,

18:22.460 --> 18:24.670
and can we just
leave it at that?

18:24.670 --> 18:27.500
Cool. Yeah.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.580
We can leave it at cool.

18:34.580 --> 18:35.830
Did you see that?

18:35.830 --> 18:37.580
I'm very proud.

18:49.290 --> 18:52.620
(inhales) Ah. Ah!

18:52.620 --> 18:54.290
They're still warm.

18:55.670 --> 18:57.500
Oh my gosh.

18:57.500 --> 18:59.290
Bowie?

18:59.290 --> 19:03.920
He obviously feels really, really
bad about embarrassing you.

19:03.920 --> 19:05.420
Where is he?

19:05.420 --> 19:06.880
Around here somewhere.

19:06.880 --> 19:10.500
Listening to us rave about his
incredible baking skills.

19:12.460 --> 19:15.830
Well, if you see him,
tell him I'm in my room,

19:15.830 --> 19:17.290
and I'm done
with my belt.

19:17.290 --> 19:19.330
I can't believe
you finished that already.

19:19.330 --> 19:22.500
Yeah. I might have
a slight addiction to duct tape.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.290
Nothing I can't handle.

19:37.500 --> 19:38.750
What are you doing?

19:40.330 --> 19:43.920
Uh, nothing.
I-- W-- I-- I'm making a...

19:45.380 --> 19:47.040
I'm sorry.

19:47.040 --> 19:48.290
What's going on?

19:48.290 --> 19:50.540
He's sitting there
on my computer,

19:50.540 --> 19:53.380
going through my pictures!

19:53.380 --> 19:55.040
I'm sorry.

19:55.040 --> 19:58.620
You invaded my privacy,
and you embarrassed me,

19:58.620 --> 20:00.460
and I don't know
what you're going to say

20:00.460 --> 20:01.500
or what you're
going to do,

20:01.500 --> 20:03.460
and it's too much!

20:03.460 --> 20:04.750
I-- I wanted
to surprise you.

20:04.750 --> 20:06.420
No more surprises!

20:08.210 --> 20:09.830
Just leave me alone.

20:14.460 --> 20:15.750
Okay.

20:20.330 --> 20:22.330
What was he thinking?

20:22.330 --> 20:24.710
What was he doing?

20:25.920 --> 20:27.500
There's one way to find out.

20:28.750 --> 20:30.500
Is it okay if I look?

20:30.500 --> 20:34.290
Yeah, whatever. I'm gonna
burn it in a dumpster fire.
