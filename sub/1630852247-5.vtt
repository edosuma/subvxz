00:06.520 --> 00:12.480
THE MORNING AFTER BEING KNOCKED OUT
OF THE CHAMPIONS LEAGUE - APRIL 14, 2021

00:18.600 --> 00:21.360
You'll have to keep on filming
for a happy ending.

00:21.800 --> 00:25.400
Now if we screw up the championship too,

00:25.760 --> 00:28.600
we'll have the worst year
in a long time.

00:28.960 --> 00:32.960
From Tuesday on, daily quick tests
and PCR only twice a week.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.640
Great, thank you.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.800
Test number 50. Thank you.

00:40.160 --> 00:43.520
At least we still have the championship.
That's not so bad.

00:43.880 --> 00:46.960
"That's not so bad," he says!
Ever won one?

00:47.400 --> 00:50.080
How can you tell me,
"That's not so bad"?

00:50.440 --> 00:52.560
He says that to me! Come on.

00:52.920 --> 00:55.640
He says, "Not so bad.
The championship's not so bad."

00:56.000 --> 00:58.760
He's never played in one, not once!

00:59.120 --> 01:01.280
Of course it's not bad, dude.

01:01.640 --> 01:04.640
Like I never played one.
- Ever won one in France?

01:05.000 --> 01:06.320
I see.
- Idiot!

01:06.680 --> 01:08.080
Not bad, he says!

01:08.440 --> 01:10.520
Make sure you get a hat trick tomorrow.

01:10.880 --> 01:14.080
One goal's enough if we don't concede.
You have to score it.

01:14.440 --> 01:17.240
Just say,
"Yes, I'll score a hat trick tomorrow."

02:19.760 --> 02:21.440
Okay guys, we'll start

02:22.600 --> 02:26.320
with a warm up. Tomorrow's players
know the drill, go inside.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.600
Everybody else does basic training here.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.720
It will be relatively short today.

02:34.080 --> 02:36.400
The next three games
are extremely important.

02:36.760 --> 02:40.160
But I'll say more about that tomorrow,
when we're all here.

02:40.520 --> 02:43.560
Okay, so enjoy your workout.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.280
Let's run one lap.

02:50.240 --> 02:53.360
Choupo is on my agenda today.
We want to renew his contract,

02:53.800 --> 02:56.440
and now of course
the question is for how long.

02:56.800 --> 03:01.920
Normally we have a rule that
if a player is over 31

03:02.280 --> 03:05.120
we only do one-year contracts,

03:06.440 --> 03:11.360
but in his case it's not that easy.

03:11.720 --> 03:16.320
Once that rule is broken it stays
broken. So we gotta make up our minds.

03:16.960 --> 03:18.800
That's why we have to talk about this

03:19.360 --> 03:24.200
and decide together
where to go from here.

03:24.560 --> 03:28.480
We need to find a solution together,
so that we all stand behind it.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.440
Our financial situation means
we can't buy a new striker.

03:32.880 --> 03:38.880
This is a huge point
where for once, perhaps,

03:39.400 --> 03:43.120
due to the coronavirus situation,

03:43.480 --> 03:46.840
we're financially not in a position
to play hardball.

03:47.280 --> 03:51.960
25 appearances, eight times in the
starting eleven, and 17 substitutions.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.560
Five goals. No assists.

03:54.920 --> 03:58.640
I really want to hang on to him,
we want to hang on to him.

04:01.720 --> 04:06.120
Give it a try. - Okay, let's start
negotiations and see what happens.

04:06.560 --> 04:09.880
I still remember when it was
Uli Hoeneß, Karl Hopfner and I,

04:10.240 --> 04:13.840
the entire Executive Board
was just the three of us.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.480
Back then we had maybe
five transfers in the summer.

04:18.840 --> 04:21.560
If three of them performed well,
we were happy.

04:22.000 --> 04:26.920
Most importantly, the club has to have
a fundamental idea.

04:27.280 --> 04:32.000
With a new head coach, we have to avoid
turning the whole system on its head

04:32.360 --> 04:35.640
and then having the next one
turn it upside down again.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.120
You have to have a strong
philosophy as a club.

04:42.320 --> 04:46.600
If Yo loses this game,
he's not getting lunch today.

04:51.120 --> 04:54.200
Goal! Alright.

04:54.920 --> 04:57.200
He's saved his lunch.

04:58.680 --> 05:01.560
We believe we have
a broad leadership at this club.

05:01.920 --> 05:07.000
With other top clubs, responsibility for
team success may lie with two people.

05:07.360 --> 05:10.440
We distribute that load on
5, 6 or 7 shoulders …

05:10.880 --> 05:13.600
And behind them hungry young talents

05:14.040 --> 05:16.760
with great potential,

05:17.600 --> 05:21.480
who have the chance to grow here,
given the number of games we play.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.520
We started in 2017.

05:27.880 --> 05:32.120
We've been at the FC Bayern Campus in
northern Munich for almost four years.

05:32.600 --> 05:35.760
It's four times the size
of Säbener Straße.

05:36.120 --> 05:41.240
We have seven training fields here, and
a small stadium for the U19s and U17s.

05:41.600 --> 05:45.400
It's an impressive site
with everything the youngsters need

05:45.760 --> 05:49.360
to reach the next step
in their footballing careers.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.960
FC Bayern must never forget
what it is that made it great.

06:00.320 --> 06:04.280
Young players like Franz Beckenbauer,
Gerd Müller, Sepp Maier,

06:05.160 --> 06:09.840
Owen Hargreaves, Schweinsteiger,
Lahm, Didi Hamann, just to name a few.

06:10.200 --> 06:14.120
These are all
players who grew up with us.

06:14.840 --> 06:18.840
In the evening, if you look from the
campus to the Allianz Arena all lit up,

06:19.280 --> 06:23.920
I'm sure every young player sees that,
and they dream of playing there.

06:24.280 --> 06:26.800
At FC Bayern
we're still primarily focused

06:27.160 --> 06:31.240
on attracting every player from Bavaria
and signing them to the club.

06:31.680 --> 06:34.840
Above U17 and U19,
the air gets thinner quality-wise,

06:35.200 --> 06:39.360
so we have to keep our eye on
new talent in the wider German market,

06:39.720 --> 06:42.400
and internationally as well.

06:43.320 --> 06:45.880
Our most important partnership
is with FC Dallas,

06:46.240 --> 06:48.280
a very good, established club
in the MLS.

06:49.720 --> 06:52.160
We have 200 youth players on our campus.

06:52.520 --> 06:56.040
In Dallas they're training a total
of 3,000 youth players.

06:57.680 --> 07:02.400
We're regarded as the top developer
of youth and talent here in the US.

07:02.840 --> 07:07.160
The partnership with FC Bayern
allows us to sign some of these players,

07:07.520 --> 07:10.200
as they understand there's
a pathway between the two teams

07:10.560 --> 07:12.040
and opportunities that exist.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.480
The most prominent example
is Chris Richards,

07:15.840 --> 07:18.000
plus two or three other players.

07:18.440 --> 07:22.040
We saw we can benefit greatly
from the partnership.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.120
Chris was one of the key players
last year for us,

07:26.480 --> 07:28.400
also in the third division.

07:30.720 --> 07:34.400
It's important for us to bring
young players to the professional field.

07:35.160 --> 07:39.360
For economic reasons,
but above all for reasons of identity.

07:39.720 --> 07:43.960
The Bavarian slogan "We are what
we are", Bayern Munich's self-image

07:44.320 --> 07:48.480
of having to win titles, is something
our players have to learn too.

07:49.840 --> 07:55.800
But on the other hand the boys need time
to mature, time to learn and to grow.

07:56.240 --> 07:59.440
In the youth department,
you have to be careful

07:59.800 --> 08:01.120
not to rush things.

08:01.560 --> 08:03.680
But nevertheless I believe that overall,

08:04.040 --> 08:08.240
the top teams in Europe will continue
to grow their focus on young players.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.760
LOOKING FORWARD TO PARIS! HANSI

08:20.120 --> 08:23.520
A nice note from Hansi.
You have to edit that in!

08:23.960 --> 08:27.120
We had all the opportunities
but we just didn't take them.

08:27.480 --> 08:31.920
Another day, another game. Next is the
Bundesliga, which is just as important.

08:32.760 --> 08:37.400
Hello, everyone. Bayern play Wolfsburg
tomorrow in a clash of the top two.

08:37.760 --> 08:41.360
Welcome to the sports media talk.
Hello, Hansi.

08:41.720 --> 08:46.240
Mr. Flick, will you coach the national
team next season or stay at Bayern?

08:46.600 --> 08:50.000
Your talks with Oliver Kahn,
has there been any progress?

08:50.440 --> 08:54.600
Has there been a change in his attitude?
Did you talk about your future plans?

08:55.040 --> 08:57.760
After exiting the Champions League
and the German Cup,

08:58.120 --> 09:01.480
this will go down in history as
a disappointing season.

09:01.840 --> 09:06.440
How do you go into these last games
with this the only title Bayern can win?

09:06.840 --> 09:12.440
Right now the focus of all coaches,
players, the whole environment, the club

09:12.800 --> 09:16.040
is completely on these three games
because they're very important.

09:16.440 --> 09:21.560
Thank you everyone, have a nice weekend.
Until next time in Wolfsburg. Goodbye.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.480
Let's go, 12 seconds, stay even,
stay in your lane.

09:33.920 --> 09:38.560
The most important part
of every season is the Bundesliga.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.520
This is what the clubs
are always focused on day to day.

09:47.720 --> 09:51.200
This is my 10th championship.
So let's make this happen.

09:52.480 --> 09:55.040
And then we can have a party for me.

09:57.960 --> 10:01.160
The league title is the most
demanding one there is.

10:01.520 --> 10:06.360
There are 34 games in the league, and
every single game is a brutal challenge.

10:06.720 --> 10:12.000
So it's definitely no consolation prize.
It's not like I've won it 100 times.

10:12.640 --> 10:16.480
All of our great successes
in recent years have obviously lessened

10:16.840 --> 10:20.440
the prestige of becoming German
champions, because now everyone thinks

10:20.800 --> 10:23.960
it's only a good season
if you win the Champions League.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.960
And that's terrible.

10:27.400 --> 10:30.360
We mustn't forget
when the Bundesliga was founded,

10:30.720 --> 10:32.760
FC Bayern wasn't even in it.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.320
The Munich team starts to
command the field …

10:37.680 --> 10:40.520
Great movement, very precise …

10:41.080 --> 10:42.240
Nice footwork …

10:42.600 --> 10:45.080
Here comes Ohlhauser again. He scores.

10:45.640 --> 10:50.520
As a boy, I think I was ten or twelve
years old, my uncle who lived in Munich

10:50.960 --> 10:54.440
took me to a soccer game
on Grünwalder Straße to see TSV 1860.

10:55.640 --> 10:58.280
That was the top team in Munich
at the time.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.440
The South German champions
are TSV 1860 Munich.

11:02.800 --> 11:06.680
Yugoslav goalkeeper
Radenkovic cannot hide his joy.

11:07.120 --> 11:10.200
And the TSV 1860 fans
are cheering their heroes.

11:11.200 --> 11:15.560
In 1963 the Bundesliga
was introduced throughout Germany.

11:15.960 --> 11:21.160
And TSV 1860, back then the
more successful club here in Munich,

11:21.560 --> 11:26.320
became a founding member
of the Bundesliga, not FC Bayern.

11:26.680 --> 11:30.360
Back then we had a well-functioning,
solid team with good players

11:30.720 --> 11:34.160
who wanted to get the chance
to play in the Bundesliga,

11:34.520 --> 11:38.640
so they left the club. And FC Bayern
soon found itself without a team.

11:39.840 --> 11:45.200
FC Bayern has always had,
I would say, visionary leaders.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.400
Angelo Knorr was a homosexual
and stigmatized for it.

11:49.840 --> 11:53.400
At the time his ideas were
modern and unconventional.

11:53.760 --> 11:58.680
He organized friendlies against
English clubs to further their horizons.

11:59.120 --> 12:03.880
Or Kurt Landauer, who suffered terrible
discrimination as a Jew in Germany.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.360
He was a free spirit
who hired Hungarian coaches

12:07.720 --> 12:10.120
and explored new ideas and tactics.

12:10.480 --> 12:16.360
Fans in the south bank still honor him,
which I think is absolutely wonderful.

12:16.720 --> 12:20.880
In the '60s and '70s, Wilhelm Neudecker
was another visionary president

12:21.240 --> 12:23.400
who gave FC Bayern
a new direction for the future.

12:23.760 --> 12:27.800
For instance, even though we weren't
in the Bundesliga at the time,

12:28.240 --> 12:30.400
his goal was to become
Germany's number one sports club.

12:30.840 --> 12:34.000
He brought in Tschik Čajkovski,
a Bundesliga coach.

12:34.400 --> 12:36.440
And he put his faith in youth players.

12:36.840 --> 12:41.320
They signed the best regional talent,
including players like Sepp Maier.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.800
FC Bayern's number 1, Maier.

12:44.720 --> 12:48.120
Sepp Maier. And again, Maier.

12:49.000 --> 12:53.440
We were all around the age of 20, so we
were a very young team at the time.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.320
Critics and insiders are
of the same opinion,

12:56.880 --> 13:00.240
that Franz Beckenbauer is the greatest
talent in German soccer in years.

13:00.640 --> 13:04.960
At just 20, he is an idol for the masses
and a genuine star for soccer fans.

13:05.320 --> 13:09.320
The team was ready for new blood,
new energy, young players.

13:10.040 --> 13:15.200
Munich defender Schwarzenbeck, No. 6, is
a perfect match with Franz Beckenbauer.

13:15.640 --> 13:20.160
Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck was the
best defensive companion for Franz.

13:21.480 --> 13:24.960
He mopped everything up,
then Franz could pass where he wanted.

13:25.320 --> 13:28.120
And Gator always teased him, saying,

13:28.480 --> 13:32.280
"If you get to the center line,
pass and go back so we stay safe."

13:35.760 --> 13:39.280
One of my greatest discoveries
was stubby little Müller.

13:39.760 --> 13:43.040
It's an almost telepathic understanding.
Müller scores.

13:48.760 --> 13:51.000
I will never forget that moment.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.520
Coming from an amateur club
to FC Bayern,

13:54.960 --> 13:56.960
that's incredible.

13:57.320 --> 14:02.440
People felt that this club
really had something going on,

14:02.880 --> 14:06.400
that they had a plan. They had
the courage to dream big dreams.

14:06.800 --> 14:08.560
And I think that's the reason

14:08.920 --> 14:12.720
so many dynamic young players
from our region

14:13.080 --> 14:15.840
found their way to FC Bayern.

14:17.760 --> 14:20.840
JUNE 26, 1965
PROMOTION PLAY-OFFS FOR BUNDESLIGA

14:32.280 --> 14:36.760
And I don't have to tell you
what happened then.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.360
WE DID IT!

14:56.600 --> 14:58.560
Oh, nice polo, hope it fits.

14:58.960 --> 15:02.560
Let me have a look! Thank you.

15:04.040 --> 15:05.880
Another one, please.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.000
Well, you know, it's kinda blurry.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.840
Okay! Guess I'm ready.

15:13.000 --> 15:14.960
I only wore this suit for the occasion.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.560
It's not every day
a talent like you signs.

15:18.920 --> 15:22.440
Now you don't need anyone else to sign
for you. You can do this yourself.

15:22.920 --> 15:25.640
Yeah, he practiced his signature.
- You did?

15:26.680 --> 15:28.440
That's good.

15:28.880 --> 15:30.680
Are you happy, Jamal?

15:31.040 --> 15:32.920
Be careful what you answer.

15:33.280 --> 15:36.960
When you're done signing please look up.
Perfect. Yes.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.440
Thank you.

15:38.800 --> 15:44.560
Today there's a lot you can coach,
but one thing makes all the difference,

15:44.920 --> 15:49.360
and that's attitude, the ability
to really develop the confidence,

15:49.720 --> 15:52.000
even as a young man, to say,

15:52.360 --> 15:55.200
"Hey, I can do all of this."

16:02.360 --> 16:08.000
There's a great feeling around here,
even the weather's nice. Great memories.

16:08.680 --> 16:09.880
How are you?

16:10.240 --> 16:13.080
I lived here on campus
for about four months.

16:13.440 --> 16:17.600
Then I moved in with my family,
but my time here was really nice.

16:18.000 --> 16:22.640
My father and I used to practice drills
in the street or the garden.

16:23.040 --> 16:26.600
He also taught me ball control,
running, and stuff like that.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.840
All that helped me a lot.

16:29.200 --> 16:31.920
I played for 7 or 8 years at Chelsea

16:32.280 --> 16:35.360
and at 16 I got the offer
to go to FC Bayern.

16:36.400 --> 16:39.040
My father is from Nigeria
and my mother from Stuttgart.

16:39.440 --> 16:42.320
You had a really nice impact
on this place.

16:42.720 --> 16:45.760
Good to see you!
- Man, you really have grown up.

16:46.120 --> 16:50.000
Yeah, a bit, also got a bit stronger.

16:52.280 --> 16:55.000
He always stood out to me.
He has a good first touch.

16:55.360 --> 16:59.920
Wonderful dribbling. He passes and goes,
he wants the return pass.

17:00.360 --> 17:04.200
See you later.
- Keep on doing that. Or better.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.040
Take care.

17:06.520 --> 17:09.320
I told Hansi I would invite
a young player I liked.

17:09.680 --> 17:13.200
Hansi said sure, and then afterwards,
"He can come anytime."

17:13.560 --> 17:15.520
After that Jamal always trained with us.

17:17.440 --> 17:21.760
Bambi! If you compare a picture of Bambi
with a picture of Jamal,

17:22.200 --> 17:27.680
there's a resemblance.
I mean, not the face, but the body.

17:29.120 --> 17:32.120
Jamal is like everyone's little brother.
He came in

17:32.480 --> 17:37.040
when a lot of injuries were going on,
and he showed he can play at this level.

17:40.160 --> 17:45.320
It was obvious when he started
the match against Lazio. Utterly calm.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.720
CHAMPIONS LEAGUE ROUND OF 16
And he was just 17.

17:49.440 --> 17:53.640
Yeah, he was relatively relaxed
and relatively cheeky.

17:54.000 --> 17:59.080
And it was clear that he could handle
real pressure. He could make it someday.

18:13.520 --> 18:17.160
Taking the leap is one thing, but to
establish yourself is something else.

18:17.840 --> 18:20.200
That doesn't even happen
one in a hundred times.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.640
Pass from the left to Musiala
and there is the goal.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.520
Pretty courageous of the boy.

18:29.880 --> 18:34.760
He is the youngest Champions League
goalscorer in FC Bayern's history.

18:35.480 --> 18:39.560
He hasn't achieved anything yet.
He has a good contract, congratulations!

18:39.920 --> 18:43.520
He plays for Bayern Munich, he's been
asked to play on the national team.

18:43.880 --> 18:45.320
Everything looks great.

18:45.680 --> 18:49.440
But now come the critical steps
that he has to prove he can take.

18:51.480 --> 18:55.640
APRIL 16, 2021
MUNICH AIRPORT

18:58.720 --> 19:04.080
The financial news is always about
problems. You're always too late to buy.

19:09.120 --> 19:13.280
If Leipzig fail to win
against Hoffenheim tonight,

19:13.720 --> 19:17.760
then in Wolfsburg we can take a big step
towards winning the Bundesliga.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.920
He got it, right?

19:20.280 --> 19:21.680
No, no …

19:22.040 --> 19:25.120
Alright, calm down everybody.
We need to relax.

19:25.480 --> 19:27.120
We're totally calm.

19:28.640 --> 19:30.360
I am calm.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.360
Whoa, it's alright!

19:34.720 --> 19:36.840
There's the one point.

19:37.200 --> 19:41.160
One more corner.
- Who'll be German champions?

19:46.520 --> 19:50.040
It's gonna be a happy ending.
- No, wait …

19:53.240 --> 19:55.480
No, no, no …

19:56.040 --> 19:57.760
I don't believe it.

19:58.120 --> 20:00.720
That's unbelievable.
- I don't believe it.

20:01.080 --> 20:05.800
No! How could he award another corner?
- There was a foul before.

20:06.200 --> 20:08.120
I can't believe this.

20:08.480 --> 20:11.200
Ah! Hand ball! Hand ball!
It'll be disallowed.

20:11.560 --> 20:15.360
No, it'll be disallowed.
Any hand ball when a goal is scored …

20:15.720 --> 20:18.200
That's gotta suck for them.

20:19.040 --> 20:23.200
But look at the slowmo!
There's clearly no hand ball. Come on!

20:23.600 --> 20:26.960
Unfortunately not, what a bummer.
No goal.

20:27.360 --> 20:31.000
Ah! Hey! He finally comes out of
his dungeon. You missed a big thing.

20:33.760 --> 20:35.640
Hand ball, hand ball.

20:42.120 --> 20:45.360
You're on this bus right here,
Leroy, over there.

20:47.600 --> 20:48.720
Here.

20:49.160 --> 20:52.240
Hansi, you're on this bus. Danny here.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.720
And Scotty, take that bus.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.320
All set!

21:04.720 --> 21:06.960
Six games to go
in the Bundesliga season,

21:07.320 --> 21:11.240
and the future of Bayern head coach
Hansi Flick is still unclear.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.760
Will he go to the DFB
or will he stay at FC Bayern?

21:15.120 --> 21:19.680
Some stories you do get tired of, but it
is a strange situation for FC Bayern.

21:20.040 --> 21:22.920
Maybe it's a consequence
of having won everything.

21:23.280 --> 21:27.440
You can see in his face that something's
eating at him, churning inside,

21:27.840 --> 21:30.160
that he has
a very difficult decision to make.

21:30.520 --> 21:34.840
Finally, I think you've decided
what you'll do after the summer …

21:35.200 --> 21:37.880
That's what you think,
I don't have to answer that.

21:38.240 --> 21:40.560
Okay. Thanks.
- Good. Thanks.

21:48.320 --> 21:52.160
One of the most difficult tasks
in the Bundesliga.

21:52.600 --> 21:55.400
FC Bayern face VfL Wolfsburg away

21:55.800 --> 21:58.760
just four days
after their match in Paris.

21:59.640 --> 22:04.160
A very important step towards their
9th German league title in a row.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.680
In the line-up today Jamal Musiala.

22:09.000 --> 22:10.400
First chance for FC Bayern.

22:10.760 --> 22:12.640
Choupo, keep at it. That's good.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.760
Musiala against Mbabu,

22:19.120 --> 22:20.360
a tough matchup.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.040
Through, through!

22:22.840 --> 22:25.280
FC Bayern dominating,
here's Alphonso Davies.

22:25.720 --> 22:29.160
Great movement with Jamal Musiala
and he finishes.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.520
Score is 1-0!

22:33.640 --> 22:35.560
Jamal Musiala.

22:35.960 --> 22:37.960
The boy's got it, eh?

22:38.480 --> 22:42.160
And again with Musiala,
this time to Alaba.

22:42.520 --> 22:48.560
Goalkeeper Casteels makes a mistake
and Choupo-Moting takes the shot.

22:52.720 --> 22:56.160
2-0. FC Bayern dominating
the game in every aspect,

22:56.600 --> 22:59.800
but here's a counter from Schlager,
and here is Weghorst.

23:05.360 --> 23:08.400
Here come Bayern again.
Attack led by Pavard,

23:08.760 --> 23:10.880
Thomas Müller takes over,
cross to Musiala

23:11.320 --> 23:13.720
and he scores.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.840
Hey. With a header!

23:21.720 --> 23:23.040
Unbelievable.

23:23.480 --> 23:26.080
What a crazy game so far. Next chance!

23:27.080 --> 23:30.760
Now Wolfsburg,
with Weghorst, but here comes Neuer.

23:35.960 --> 23:38.840
Ottavio has time to cross …

23:39.200 --> 23:41.160
Maximilian Philipp!

23:42.360 --> 23:43.000
3-2!

23:45.400 --> 23:48.360
Musiala advances, what a great game!

23:50.000 --> 23:52.480
Here comes Müller …

23:52.920 --> 23:56.280
over to Musiala but it goes nowhere.

23:57.520 --> 24:00.760
Three big points closer to the title.

24:01.120 --> 24:02.120
Go, guys!

24:24.160 --> 24:25.800
Eight minutes left to play.

24:28.360 --> 24:30.240
Good ball, good ball!

24:33.360 --> 24:34.680
Roussillon!

24:37.880 --> 24:39.600
Are you ready to defend?

24:41.200 --> 24:45.200
Five minutes? How?
- Five minutes' injury time added.

24:47.120 --> 24:49.160
Hey, final whistle …

24:50.200 --> 24:51.840
That's enough!

25:26.120 --> 25:27.520
Okay guys!

25:27.880 --> 25:29.240
Johnny …

25:31.320 --> 25:33.880
Guys, guys! Listen.

25:34.240 --> 25:36.600
I have something to tell you.

25:40.920 --> 25:45.160
I believe we have a powerful connection,
a very special relationship.

25:45.520 --> 25:49.840
It's important to me that I tell you
this, and you don't hear it elsewhere.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.640
I told the club …

25:53.280 --> 25:56.640
After the game against Paris this week
I said that

25:57.040 --> 26:01.920
I will be quitting after this season
and don't want to continue.

26:02.280 --> 26:06.720
I made this decision
for several reasons.

26:07.480 --> 26:10.080
For me it was and still is …

26:11.720 --> 26:15.800
the ultimate joy to work with you.
You have grit and determination

26:16.160 --> 26:18.440
unlike anything I've ever seen.

26:18.800 --> 26:23.880
So, thank you for this wonderful
and very successful time we've had.

26:24.240 --> 26:28.600
It obviously wasn't easy for me to make
this decision, but how can I put it?

26:28.960 --> 26:32.720
I just can't do it anymore, I'm done
being the tough guy to the public.

26:33.160 --> 26:35.200
I hope you and the club understand.

26:36.640 --> 26:42.600
Thanks again for everything, guys.
Let's continue. We have five more games,

26:43.400 --> 26:45.480
so let's get the job done
and do it right.

26:45.920 --> 26:48.960
Thank you, guys. Yeah, that's it.

27:05.720 --> 27:08.840
I'm not doing it. I'm only doing SKY!

27:09.520 --> 27:12.720
Do I really have to say it three times?

27:13.080 --> 27:15.360
Sorry, Hansi, if you don't,
they'll think something's wrong.

27:15.720 --> 27:18.080
So I'm afraid you have to do it.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.440
Guess your mailbox is exploding?

27:51.080 --> 27:52.400
Yes.

28:07.560 --> 28:09.080
Yes, possibly

28:09.480 --> 28:12.480
there were moments

28:13.240 --> 28:19.280
when we should have asked ourselves
if we should have tried harder.

28:20.160 --> 28:24.880
Or communicated more
instead of just plowing ahead?

28:25.280 --> 28:30.200
Blaming everything on Hasan

28:30.680 --> 28:36.720
is a very short-sighted,
extremely short-sighted point of view.

28:37.360 --> 28:40.880
He wanted success. I wanted success.

28:41.400 --> 28:45.600
I have great respect
for his work as a coach.

28:46.560 --> 28:49.640
And that will endure.
To win these six titles …

28:50.720 --> 28:53.120
What an incredible success.

28:53.520 --> 28:57.400
I think that Hansi
would definitely have stayed with us

28:57.760 --> 29:03.120
had he not been offered the chance to be
head coach of the German national team.

29:03.480 --> 29:06.960
It seems that's the pinnacle
of what a coach can achieve.

29:07.840 --> 29:11.920
But the media will still give you a slap
in the face when you lose a game.

29:12.280 --> 29:14.840
So that won't change,
Hansi will realize.

29:25.200 --> 29:31.000
If you just watched the news a little,
you kind of had an idea it was coming.

29:31.360 --> 29:33.000
Sure.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.000
Of course I hope,

29:35.360 --> 29:41.360
from a selfish point of view, that he
takes over the national team in summer.

29:41.720 --> 29:46.440
Otherwise it would be a real shame
if we completely lost him as a coach,

29:46.800 --> 29:49.120
from the players' perspective.

29:49.480 --> 29:54.000
He's won everything with Bayern, and I
hope we can do that with him at the DFB.

29:54.920 --> 29:57.840
Unfortunately
that does nothing for David.

29:58.840 --> 30:04.800
We didn't know there were problems.
As a player you don't always realize.

30:05.920 --> 30:09.320
But you don't leave a team like this
for no reason. - Yes,

30:09.680 --> 30:10.920
that's right.

30:11.440 --> 30:17.480
I'm not happy about it. But of course
you have to accept it and respect that.

30:19.320 --> 30:22.000
Like I said …

30:23.360 --> 30:29.400
Everyone has to make their own decision.
And that's exactly what happened here.

30:37.920 --> 30:41.960
He and the team were very close,
they had a very powerful bond.

30:42.320 --> 30:46.360
And you could feel that
right up to the end.

30:46.720 --> 30:50.600
When Hansi said he was leaving,
you saw how emotional it was,

30:50.960 --> 30:54.200
how hard it was for him
and for the players to accept.

30:54.640 --> 30:57.960
I think there was also
a little bit of relief.

30:58.320 --> 31:02.040
And in my opinion,
maybe it was even a little too late.

31:02.440 --> 31:05.600
I think everyone has to deal with that
as they will.

31:05.960 --> 31:10.560
Personally, I would have loved
to see him continue at Bayern,

31:10.920 --> 31:13.520
because he really could have
created an era.

31:13.920 --> 31:18.480
A year and a half is no era.
That was just a very successful period.

31:18.840 --> 31:24.080
But the late '60s
and the '70s, that was an era.

31:24.440 --> 31:28.400
That was FC Bayern's era,

31:29.120 --> 31:31.680
when the myth was born.

31:35.560 --> 31:38.760
When FC Bayern came into the Bundesliga,
they were considered

31:39.200 --> 31:45.080
a young, charming team, like SC Freiburg
today. You can't imagine that now.

31:45.480 --> 31:48.120
They were voted the most likeable
Bundesliga team.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.880
We were all young guys at the time,

31:51.280 --> 31:55.320
and out of the 15 of us,
10 had been in the youth team together.

31:55.680 --> 32:00.400
So we knew each other. On promotion
to the Bundesliga, we were 18, 19, 20.

32:00.800 --> 32:05.960
And we all stayed together.
We were one unit, fully committed.

32:07.720 --> 32:11.440
Good friends will never be separated

32:12.520 --> 32:17.640
You knew each other so well. At times
you'd have an argument, or even a fight.

32:18.240 --> 32:20.400
But it would blow over

32:20.800 --> 32:24.680
and we'd pull together for the match.
That's the way it was.

32:26.400 --> 32:31.040
We came third in our first year
in the Bundesliga, and we won the cup.

32:31.480 --> 32:36.280
In that first year we showed right away
that we really belonged there.

32:36.640 --> 32:40.440
FC BAYERN VS. GLASGOW RANGERS
CUP WINNERS' CUP FINAL - MAY 31, 1967

32:47.480 --> 32:50.600
The following year they won
the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup.

32:50.960 --> 32:54.120
This showed how good
this well-practiced team was.

32:55.360 --> 32:58.360
And four years later
they won the double.

32:58.720 --> 33:03.680
We all want to warmly congratulate
the new German champions.

33:12.720 --> 33:17.520
In terms of how Bundesliga clubs
including FC Bayern financed themselves,

33:17.880 --> 33:19.400
ticket sales at games were huge,

33:19.880 --> 33:22.840
with large takings
from international friendlies.

33:23.680 --> 33:26.120
When we won the European Cup
or the World Cup,

33:26.480 --> 33:30.520
we had to take advantage of these titles
to earn money again.

33:31.600 --> 33:35.760
So we had to travel and play
in Peru, and Brazil, and Mexico.

33:36.200 --> 33:39.320
We played on Monday and Wednesday,
flew back on Thursday,

33:39.680 --> 33:41.440
and on Saturday we played Bundesliga.

33:41.800 --> 33:44.800
That wasn't unusual,
it was often the case.

33:45.160 --> 33:47.160
EUROPEAN CUP FINAL - MAY 15, 1974

33:47.520 --> 33:50.240
Welcome to Brussels Heysel Stadium.
It is a great evening for football,

33:50.600 --> 33:54.760
a wonderful evening for the European
Cup final between German champions

33:55.160 --> 33:56.800
Bayern Munich and Atletico Madrid.

33:58.160 --> 34:01.560
I remember this was a rough game,
a dull back and forth.

34:01.920 --> 34:03.880
Only nine minutes left on the clock
in extra time.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.560
Till that free kick!

34:05.920 --> 34:08.920
And Luis with a wonderful free kick
over the wall.

34:09.520 --> 34:10.920
What a shot by Luis.

34:12.520 --> 34:15.000
Now Bayern will really
start feeling the pressure.

34:15.720 --> 34:17.600
Only five minutes left on the clock.

34:17.960 --> 34:21.360
In the 120th minute, just before
full time, we'd basically lost.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.120
We were already done,
then came Schwarzenbeck.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.200
In the last second, not even minute,

34:27.640 --> 34:32.280
he crossed the halfway line, he didn't
know what else to do and shot at goal.

34:32.640 --> 34:36.120
Schwarzenbeck, yes!
Schwarzenbeck scores the equalizer!

34:40.720 --> 34:42.720
And there it is again.

34:43.080 --> 34:45.280
That glorious moment of ecstasy

34:45.640 --> 34:49.960
when all the myths and legends are born.

34:50.720 --> 34:52.720
And now there's going to have to
be a rematch.

34:53.080 --> 34:55.880
Back then we still had the replay rule.

34:56.240 --> 34:58.800
It was unbelievable,
we didn't even have toothbrushes.

34:59.160 --> 35:03.160
REPLAY OF CUP WINNERS' CUP FINAL
Nobody expected to play again on Friday.

35:04.400 --> 35:08.760
And now Hoeneß almost has a free path.
He's gotta go alone, nobody's with him.

35:09.120 --> 35:11.240
Hoeness executes and scores.

35:12.440 --> 35:16.000
On the Friday we just
crushed Atletico Madrid. We won 4-0.

35:16.360 --> 35:19.440
An almost hopelessly beaten team

35:19.880 --> 35:22.840
became the superior team
thanks to goals from Uli Hoeneß,

35:23.360 --> 35:26.280
and that led to three more goals.

35:28.600 --> 35:31.520
The greatest trophy that can be won

35:31.880 --> 35:35.000
is now claimed by German champions

35:35.360 --> 35:37.120
FC Bayern from Munich.

35:38.200 --> 35:42.560
That was the launch for us winning the
Cup Winners' Cup three times in a row.

35:42.920 --> 35:46.080
MAY 28, 1975 - CUP WINNERS' CUP
LEEDS UNITED VS. FC BAYERN

35:58.080 --> 36:01.120
MAY 12, 1976 - CUP WINNERS' CUP
FC BAYERN VS. SAINT-ÉTIENNE

36:20.080 --> 36:23.840
Hi! Choupo-Moting!
I have a meeting. Thanks.

36:26.000 --> 36:30.400
Enjoy your breakfast.
- Shall I clear the tables for you?

36:32.200 --> 36:33.560
No, thanks.

36:34.920 --> 36:38.240
We wanted to talk with you briefly
about the situation

36:38.680 --> 36:42.800
and let you know that we absolutely want
to keep you here at the club.

36:43.200 --> 36:46.800
We'll have to talk
about the duration of your new contract.

36:47.240 --> 36:51.560
We've seen the part you play
in the team.

36:51.920 --> 36:55.880
Especially towards the end,
when you played,

36:56.240 --> 36:58.840
you took your chances …

36:59.200 --> 37:03.280
So it makes sense
not only for that reason

37:03.640 --> 37:06.520
but also because you're
an asset to our team.

37:06.960 --> 37:10.320
I may not be a big scorer
or finisher like Lewandowski,

37:10.720 --> 37:13.440
but every game I go in.
And I tell myself

37:13.800 --> 37:16.800
that I want to perform well,
I want to help the team,

37:17.160 --> 37:20.880
and if possible score a goal
or provide an assist.

37:21.240 --> 37:26.360
But I see myself as a team player.
- We talked after the Leipzig game.

37:26.720 --> 37:30.120
Yeah?
- It was really about your performance.

37:30.480 --> 37:32.960
For us the first half was flawless!

37:33.320 --> 37:36.640
Getting thrown into the game
and the way you handled it.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.280
That was good, really good.

37:45.280 --> 37:47.760
For all the new players

37:48.120 --> 37:51.800
like Choupo, Leroy,
Marc Roca, Sarr, Tanguy,

37:52.200 --> 37:56.520
and of course everyone else too,
we want to win the league.

37:56.920 --> 38:02.040
You don't win titles by cutting costs,
you win titles by making more money.

38:02.400 --> 38:08.240
That's the bottom line, and that doesn't
only apply to professional sports.

38:08.600 --> 38:12.920
I would say
the same thing is true of any industry.

38:17.240 --> 38:20.040
Of course we do acquisitions.
Cold calls too.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.520
We always watch the market closely.

38:22.960 --> 38:24.080
Sounds great!

38:24.440 --> 38:27.720
We used the treble
and then the recent "sextuple"

38:28.120 --> 38:32.880
to establish FC Bayern as a strong brand
looking for new partners.

38:34.960 --> 38:37.440
And here it is. Let's take a look.

38:38.520 --> 38:42.320
A lot of people think that we have
potential partners lined up and waiting.

38:42.680 --> 38:47.240
No, our partners have to be
a good fit for us.

38:48.240 --> 38:51.160
We too have to save,
and that's what we are doing in fact.

38:51.600 --> 38:56.880
We're not really flush with cash,
and our savings account is melting away.

38:57.240 --> 39:00.120
Take field number one, for example.

39:00.480 --> 39:04.880
The privacy screen Pep Guardiola wanted.
Do we get an electrical solution?

39:05.240 --> 39:09.480
Or a manual solution? Sounds trivial,
but it's 150,000 euro difference.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.480
Just half a yard more.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.400
Let me try it from this side.

39:19.240 --> 39:24.320
Now every time we have a
training session without spectators,

39:24.680 --> 39:27.480
our staff have to close the curtains.

39:27.840 --> 39:30.760
It's cheaper, because our staff
are there anyway.

39:31.120 --> 39:34.160
So drawing the curtains
has saved 150,000 euros.

39:34.520 --> 39:36.760
Thanks for saving all that money.

39:37.520 --> 39:39.760
We have to be attractive.

39:40.120 --> 39:44.200
We have to be attractive to our fans,
to our partners, to sponsors,

39:44.560 --> 39:49.360
and thus increase our income, rather
than me rationing cookies and water.

39:51.520 --> 39:54.760
These are the things that
we've been doing very well lately.

39:55.120 --> 39:59.800
Seeing the spaces, then getting in them
or switching positions.

40:00.200 --> 40:01.480
Today,

40:01.840 --> 40:05.040
even before the third-last matchday,
we can close it down.

40:05.400 --> 40:08.960
I want professionals out there,
ready to win the next three points.

40:09.440 --> 40:12.680
We're here to win,
we're here to get the job done. Okay?

40:23.200 --> 40:26.120
First take out the crates of beer.

40:26.480 --> 40:29.960
The champagne is in the laundry crate.
We only take one crate of beer for us.

40:45.960 --> 40:48.720
Good afternoon and welcome to Mainz,

40:49.080 --> 40:53.120
welcome to a potentially historic
Bundesliga afternoon.

40:53.600 --> 40:56.840
Bayern Munich, they have
a clear mission here today

40:57.200 --> 40:59.560
to win the 9th title in succession.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.720
Goal! What was that?

41:04.080 --> 41:07.760
Jonathan Burkhardt takes a shot
after not even three minutes

41:08.160 --> 41:13.520
and Manuel Neuer doesn't look
too good in that situation.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.280
Gets the cross into the center …

41:25.840 --> 41:29.560
Oh dear, and here is a header,
nearly an own goal there.

41:31.240 --> 41:34.040
I don't believe this! What is he doing?

41:34.400 --> 41:38.320
With a ten-point lead and four more
games, you think, "What can go wrong"?

41:38.760 --> 41:40.680
Good free kick position,

41:41.120 --> 41:44.880
and maybe another risky situation
for Manuel Neuer.

41:49.760 --> 41:53.840
Far too many mistakes.
Much, much, much too many mistakes here.

42:10.080 --> 42:12.760
2-1 the victory for Mainz.

42:13.120 --> 42:16.240
The Bayern players have to be
disappointed as Bayern Munich fail.

42:37.000 --> 42:39.200
We just weren't good today.

42:39.920 --> 42:43.160
We didn't have any opportunities.

42:44.360 --> 42:48.160
Guys, that was
the worst performance I've seen so far.

43:06.640 --> 43:10.840
Now it's time to get to work.
Up until now it's only been idle banter.

43:15.840 --> 43:18.560
We will meet up with the new coach.

43:19.320 --> 43:23.640
And we'll have a conversation with him.

43:24.520 --> 43:27.240
There are so many things
we need to discuss,

43:27.600 --> 43:29.920
and views to exchange in advance.

43:30.360 --> 43:35.000
When is the game tonight? It's at
eight, right? We could watch together.

43:35.560 --> 43:39.280
He wants to watch completely focused,
as that's our next opponent.

43:39.640 --> 43:42.760
That's great! He can give us
his impressions right away.

43:43.120 --> 43:44.080
Absolutely.

43:45.640 --> 43:48.680
I guess it must be somewhere over there.

43:49.040 --> 43:51.840
He's waiting at the door?
- That's what he said.

43:58.080 --> 44:00.000
He looks like a schoolboy.
