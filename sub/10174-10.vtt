(Abbi and Ilana) Previously
on "Broad City"...

00:01.796 --> 00:02.678
To the airport!

00:02.797 --> 00:03.679
(Abbi) You have a period stain.

00:03.798 --> 00:05.014
I have weed in my vaginé.

00:05.132 --> 00:07.099
Period pants are the ultimate decoy.

00:07.184 --> 00:08.350
We'll have to check your luggage.

00:08.469 --> 00:09.685
This bag is the bomb.

00:09.804 --> 00:11.933
This is gonna have
to go under the plane.

00:12.857 --> 00:13.973
(Jared) Welcome to Birthmarc.

00:14.058 --> 00:16.058
This is an all-expense
paid trip to Israel,

00:16.143 --> 00:17.810
provided by your living ancestors,

00:17.895 --> 00:19.812
so we're seated according

00:19.947 --> 00:20.813

4,000 steps.

01:04.408 --> 01:06.275
Oh, Winona, you gotta kick it up, girl.

01:06.360 --> 01:09.549
I just wish I had something to
talk about at my reunion, you know?

01:09.914 --> 01:11.046
Maybe I shouldn't even go.

01:11.165 --> 01:12.081
What?

01:12.166 --> 01:13.499
No, you gotta go.

01:13.634 --> 01:15.084
They're gonna miss you.

01:15.169 --> 01:17.179
You need to go give them a load of Mona.

01:17.214 --> 01:18.921
I just wish I had a...

01:19.006 --> 01:20.556
Like, a talking point, you know?

01:20.675 --> 01:23.225
I need a headline.

01:23.344 --> 01:24.727
Whoa, girl.

01:24.846 --> 01:27.313
Boy, those pilots,
they do such a good job.

01:27.398 --> 01:29.120
- They really work hard.
- I'm telling you.

01:29.155 --> 01:31.153
We should go check on them, see
if they want a little beverage.

01:31.188 --> 01:32.845
- I'll be right back.
- Know what I mean?

01:32.880 --> 01:34.019
Okay.

01:34.155 --> 01:36.655
(door opening)

01:36.741 --> 01:37.740
Everything okay?

01:37.859 --> 01:38.908
Rough winds.

01:39.026 --> 01:39.992
Looking good, girl.

01:40.077 --> 01:41.493
Well, thank you.

01:41.579 --> 01:43.746
Ladies and gentlemen, we're
about to hit a rough patch.

01:43.865 --> 01:46.999
If you move about the cabin,
please proceed with caution.

01:52.173 --> 01:53.589
(moaning)

01:56.310 --> 01:57.543
(Jared) Up next is Rachel.

01:57.678 --> 01:59.929
Hi, I'm Rachel Hanowitz.

02:00.047 --> 02:03.382
Uh, Rachel Hoffman already
called Rachel H., sorry.

02:03.517 --> 02:06.602
So you will be Rachel H-2.

02:06.721 --> 02:09.354
I'm an event planner from Montana,

02:09.440 --> 02:11.807
decent Jewish population
there, actually,

02:11.893 --> 02:14.860
but I'm looking to make it bigger.

02:16.564 --> 02:18.647
That's what I'm talking
about, huh, guys?

02:18.733 --> 02:20.282
Thank you. (clapping)

02:20.401 --> 02:21.533
Uh, Mark?

02:23.988 --> 02:25.738
Uh, shalom, my name is Mark.

02:25.823 --> 02:28.791
I run a booming nail art
business outside Boston,

02:28.910 --> 02:31.410
and I'm proudly gay... mazel...

02:31.545 --> 02:34.747
But I'm looking for a
nice Jewish girl to marry.

02:34.832 --> 02:38.083
Because that's the only way I
can gain access to my trust fund.

02:38.169 --> 02:39.084
(Jared) Nice!

02:39.170 --> 02:40.719
Right on, Mark, all right.

02:40.805 --> 02:43.222
(clapping)

02:44.759 --> 02:45.808
Uh, Abbalah?

02:52.316 --> 02:53.315
Hey.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.934
Uh, I'm Abbi.

02:55.069 --> 02:57.603
Just wanted to say that
I was one of the few

02:57.738 --> 02:59.939
who had to check their carry-on,

03:00.074 --> 03:02.691
even though I packed
really hard for a carry-on.

03:02.777 --> 03:05.194
I practice packed a couple times.

03:05.279 --> 03:08.197
Just felt like that was a sacrifice.

03:08.282 --> 03:09.581
It felt a little Jewwy.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.450
Um, Jewish-like.

03:11.585 --> 03:15.274
Anyway, I graduated
with a fine arts degree.

03:15.309 --> 03:18.290
So now I am a celebrity trainer.

03:18.426 --> 03:23.595
Um, Kris Kristofferson
comes in, mostly core work.

03:23.681 --> 03:25.431
It... Uh, it's pretty cool.

03:25.516 --> 03:29.018
So I'm a little bit lost and, um,

03:29.136 --> 03:33.355
yeah, I'm looking for
a spiritual experience,

03:33.474 --> 03:35.641
kind find myself on this trip.

03:35.726 --> 03:37.393
I'm sorry, Ilana, are you okay?

03:37.478 --> 03:38.477
Yeah.

03:38.612 --> 03:39.528
I'll go next.

03:39.647 --> 03:40.612
Okay. Thank you, Abbi.

03:40.698 --> 03:41.893
- Okay.
- Thank you.

03:41.928 --> 03:43.983
(clapping)

03:44.118 --> 03:46.702
Hey, I'm Ilana, and right now,

03:46.821 --> 03:48.120
I'm just looking to sit next to Abbi.

03:48.205 --> 03:50.489
You know, I just want to
hang, get new jokes together.

03:50.574 --> 03:53.158
Also, um, I've never been out
of the country, and also...

03:53.294 --> 03:57.629
Also, I'm looking to get
into the Moyel Chai Club.

03:57.715 --> 04:00.332
(Abbi laughing)

04:00.468 --> 04:01.667
Thank you.

04:01.752 --> 04:03.752
(clapping)

04:03.838 --> 04:04.837
Okay.

04:04.922 --> 04:05.838
Um...

04:05.923 --> 04:07.989
Let's see, Rachel H-2,

04:08.097 --> 04:09.357
you went to Dartmouth, huh?

04:09.392 --> 04:10.392
Well, you know what?

04:10.511 --> 04:11.593
I think I could see
a really bright future

04:11.679 --> 04:14.346
with you and David 3,
who went to Cornell.

04:14.432 --> 04:16.231
Ew, Cornell?

04:16.350 --> 04:18.183
Hey, it's still an Ivy.

04:18.319 --> 04:20.834
(Jared) Ah, you guys sound like
an old married couple already.

04:20.870 --> 04:25.357
Next up, Lauren, you went to
Brown, and Levi, you went to Tufts?

04:25.493 --> 04:28.360
I mean, Red Rover, Red
Rover, let Levi come over!

04:28.596 --> 04:30.762
Let's bring it on down to Gingerville!

04:30.848 --> 04:32.714
(all laughing)

04:32.800 --> 04:34.349
I said, this is J (bleep).

04:34.468 --> 04:35.851
Oh, cool.

04:35.970 --> 04:38.387
Listen, we should just
ask people to switch seats.

04:38.472 --> 04:40.472
Get ya nag on!

04:40.558 --> 04:41.523
Nagga, what?

04:41.642 --> 04:42.474
Hmm?

04:42.610 --> 04:43.642
No, no.

04:43.777 --> 04:45.360
I don't... That was like...

04:45.479 --> 04:47.396
Just a joke, I mean... Just delete that.

04:47.481 --> 04:48.981
Yeah, delete.

04:49.066 --> 04:50.699
We'll both forget it.

04:50.818 --> 04:52.568
(electronic beeping)

04:54.071 --> 04:55.070
Yo, bud.

04:55.156 --> 04:57.239
You wanna switch seats?

04:57.324 --> 04:58.457
Sweet.

05:00.377 --> 05:02.377
Thanks so much, my peer.

05:02.496 --> 05:03.795
Excuse me, sir?

05:03.881 --> 05:05.581
You are sitting in the lucky seat

05:05.666 --> 05:08.500
we always upgrade to
first class midflight.

05:08.636 --> 05:11.003
Congratulations. Come on up!

05:11.138 --> 05:14.056
Let's get you a blanket
and a glass of champagne.

05:14.175 --> 05:15.174
(whispering) Ilana! Ilana!

05:15.259 --> 05:16.558
Ilana, there's a seat!

05:16.677 --> 05:17.843
Ilana!

05:17.978 --> 05:19.428
No, no.

05:23.934 --> 05:25.601
I'm good...

05:25.686 --> 05:26.852
(clearing throat) I'm good.

05:26.937 --> 05:27.853
Shalom.

05:27.938 --> 05:30.355
Sir, would you like to switch seats?

05:32.000 --> 05:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:49.877 --> 05:51.210
We did it, dude.

05:51.345 --> 05:53.262
- Um, excuse me, sir?
- Ab, Ab.

05:53.380 --> 05:54.628
Let the guy rest in peace.

05:54.663 --> 05:56.381
Okay. I guess we're close enough.

05:56.467 --> 05:57.466
Yeah.

05:57.551 --> 05:58.717
So I've been meaning to tell you,

05:58.802 --> 06:00.519
that was a sick mile high joke.

06:00.604 --> 06:01.720
I wasn't joking.

06:01.855 --> 06:03.555
The Moyel Chai Club.

06:03.641 --> 06:05.057
You know how moyels suck baby dick?

06:05.142 --> 06:06.775
Wait, wait, what's a moyel?

06:06.894 --> 06:08.810
Honestly, are you Jewish?

06:08.896 --> 06:10.562
You're not supposed to be
on this trip if you're not.

06:10.648 --> 06:12.147
Dude, I'm sorry, what
the (bleep) is a moyel,

06:12.233 --> 06:13.899
and why are they sucking baby dick?

06:13.984 --> 06:16.902
A moyel is the Jewish dude
who performs the circumcisions.

06:16.987 --> 06:18.287
You know, like a... a bris.

06:18.405 --> 06:19.788
So they don't do it in the hospital,

06:19.907 --> 06:23.325
so these rabbis can
do whatever they want.

06:23.410 --> 06:25.794
So they take the detached baby foreskin,

06:25.913 --> 06:29.255
and they roll it around
in their mouths with wine.

06:29.290 --> 06:31.917
(retching)

06:32.002 --> 06:35.170
And then they suck the baby
dick itself to stop the bleeding.

06:35.256 --> 06:36.922
What the (bleep) are you talking about?

06:37.007 --> 06:38.473
Literally Judaism.

06:38.592 --> 06:41.476
So at every bris,
someone sucks a baby dick?

06:41.595 --> 06:45.274
Only the most sacred ceremonies do
we get to have the baby dick sucking.

06:45.309 --> 06:46.265
<i>They get to have it?</i>

06:46.350 --> 06:48.899
Yeah, it's like, Christian people
get the Nilla wafer and we get...

06:48.934 --> 06:50.362
- Like a sacrament.
- What?

06:50.438 --> 06:52.654
It's a wafer and when
you take it in your mouth,

06:52.773 --> 06:54.212
you let go of all your sins.

06:54.247 --> 06:55.407
- It's actually like, a beautiful ceremony.
-  All right.

06:55.492 --> 06:57.442
So we're going to Israel right now,

06:57.528 --> 06:59.111
and we're supposed to be Jewish.

06:59.196 --> 07:00.279
Anyway, Moyel Chai Club.

07:00.364 --> 07:02.781
I want to (bleep) a dick
on this flight, babe!

07:02.916 --> 07:05.334
An adult dick, obviously.

07:05.452 --> 07:08.120
I can't believe that you
want to (bleep) a dick

07:08.205 --> 07:10.172
after everything that just
came out of your mouth.

07:10.291 --> 07:12.207
Something about doing it in the sky.

07:13.961 --> 07:15.010
Ilana, look!

07:15.129 --> 07:17.462
Oh, my God, dude, this is a free movie!

07:17.598 --> 07:18.680
Maybe you are a Jew.

07:18.799 --> 07:19.715
Look, look!

07:19.800 --> 07:20.799
His headphones!

07:20.884 --> 07:22.718
You are dark, dude.

07:22.803 --> 07:23.990
I know.

07:25.139 --> 07:26.388
<i>(man in movie) He
didn't get it off, man!</i>

07:26.473 --> 07:27.356
<i>(man in movie) He got it off!</i>

07:27.474 --> 07:28.774
<i>Hey, hey!</i>

07:28.859 --> 07:30.609
(laughing)

07:33.781 --> 07:35.814
Shit, dude.

07:35.949 --> 07:37.149
I just got my period.

07:37.284 --> 07:38.233
Ugh.

07:38.319 --> 07:40.068
Okay, it's fine, I packed tampons.

07:42.623 --> 07:45.457
In my bag!

07:47.763 --> 07:51.431
Dude, what if you use my period pants?

07:51.567 --> 07:52.432
For what?

07:52.568 --> 07:54.935
I... I don't know.

07:55.020 --> 07:57.270
It just figures because I packed, like,

07:57.406 --> 08:00.607
every type of tampon I could find.

08:00.693 --> 08:02.743
It's all in my bag, under the plane.

08:02.828 --> 08:04.194
All right, woman up.

08:04.279 --> 08:06.830
Wad up a bunch of toilet paper
and shove it up your pussy.

08:06.949 --> 08:07.864
Up?

08:07.950 --> 08:09.282
Between the lips and the undies.

08:09.368 --> 08:10.667
Dude, it's the first day.

08:10.786 --> 08:12.119
Oof, first day.

08:12.254 --> 08:15.005
That's like putting your
spoon into a molten lava cake.

08:15.024 --> 08:16.373
It's like the first
bite of a jelly doughnut.

08:16.458 --> 08:18.508
- It's like a side of chutney.
- It's like fruit on the bottom.

08:18.627 --> 08:19.676
That's you right now.

08:19.695 --> 08:20.944
You ever seen that
movie "The Impossible"?

08:21.030 --> 08:23.447
Where that wall of
tsunami water just, like,

08:23.532 --> 08:24.865
gushes up onto the beach?

08:24.950 --> 08:25.949
Yikes.

08:26.035 --> 08:27.584
I was just gonna say,
that movie is so sad.

08:27.703 --> 08:28.619
Oh, yeah.

08:28.704 --> 08:31.455
I really need a (bleep) tampon.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.506
Shit, the line for the
bathroom is so long,

08:33.592 --> 08:35.876
even if I did want to stick a wad up...

08:36.010 --> 08:38.767
This must be what
homeless women feel like.

08:39.847 --> 08:41.823
Dude, we're just in
coach, it's not that bad.

08:41.859 --> 08:44.282
No, no. Like, how do they get tampons?

08:44.317 --> 08:46.887
If you get a couple bucks, do you
buy food or do you buy tampons?

08:47.022 --> 08:47.938
Whoa.

08:48.057 --> 08:49.389
Tampons should be free.

08:49.525 --> 08:52.109
Every woman should have access
to tampons, all different sizes.

08:52.227 --> 08:53.810
And the only reason it's not that way

08:53.896 --> 08:55.646
is because the government hates women.

08:55.731 --> 08:56.780
This is true.

08:56.899 --> 08:57.898
Elbows in, sir.

08:58.033 --> 08:59.449
Here's a reunion story.

08:59.568 --> 09:03.153
Tell them your Beyoncé's fourth-weekend
nanny and that she loves you.

09:03.238 --> 09:04.821
I don't speak French.

09:04.907 --> 09:06.206
Can I get you anything?

09:06.291 --> 09:07.374
Um...

09:07.459 --> 09:08.825
Do you guys have any tampons I could...

09:08.911 --> 09:10.410
(whispering) So sorry, no, we don't.

09:10.546 --> 09:13.997
But we have soft drinks and
food, for an additional charge.

09:14.083 --> 09:15.582
- Okay.
- You know what?

09:15.718 --> 09:17.634
Let's get something to
distract from all of this.

09:17.753 --> 09:20.364
(Mona) We got a... a
kosher snack pack for two.

09:20.399 --> 09:22.504
- How much is that?
- $38.

09:22.539 --> 09:24.430
- Oh, okay.
- All right.

09:24.465 --> 09:25.678
(Winona) There's a lot
of good stuff in there.

09:25.713 --> 09:28.011
It's yummy, you'll love it.

09:28.097 --> 09:29.836
All right, elbows in now.

09:30.483 --> 09:31.898
(Abbi) Let's get this out of the way.

09:31.984 --> 09:34.685
I am loving your comfort
despite the circumstances.

09:34.770 --> 09:36.019
Well, I'm currently sitting

09:36.105 --> 09:39.106
in a pool of my own
uterine lining, so...

09:39.241 --> 09:40.774
I'm feeling pretty comfortable.

09:40.909 --> 09:41.775
Hey, hey, hey.

09:41.910 --> 09:42.943
You know what you need to do?

09:43.078 --> 09:44.995
You need to tell them
about all that money

09:45.114 --> 09:46.446
that you gave to charity.

09:46.582 --> 09:48.498
Then I have to tell them that
I had to ask for it all back

09:48.617 --> 09:50.951
'cause I'm addicted to online poker.

09:51.086 --> 09:54.538
Okay, tell them about the bone
marrow transplant that you gave me.

09:54.623 --> 09:56.673
You gave me a bone marrow transplant.

09:56.792 --> 09:59.292
Ooh, I forgot about that.

09:59.428 --> 10:00.343
(Ilana) What?

10:00.462 --> 10:02.129
This was $38?

10:02.214 --> 10:03.463
(Abbi) Ugh, dude.

10:03.549 --> 10:05.882
Someone on this plane
has got to have a tampon.

10:05.968 --> 10:07.217
Yeah, you're right.

10:07.302 --> 10:08.668
- Let's do this.
- Okay.

10:10.856 --> 10:12.472
Do you guys have a tampon?

10:15.527 --> 10:16.860
Absorbency...

10:21.283 --> 10:22.532
Um, excuse me.

10:22.651 --> 10:23.984
Do you by any chance have a tampon?

10:24.119 --> 10:25.368
Oh, my goodness, no.

10:25.487 --> 10:26.653
I'm flattered you asked,

10:26.789 --> 10:29.406
even though many women my
age do experience spotting.

10:29.491 --> 10:30.407
Oh!

10:30.492 --> 10:32.743
I totally forgot about menopause.

10:32.828 --> 10:35.495
Menopause isn't represented
in mainstream media.

10:35.631 --> 10:37.798
Like, no one wants to talk about it.

10:40.052 --> 10:41.418
(Ilana) Hey! Hey, buddy.

10:41.503 --> 10:43.553
- Could I get that pita?
- This pita?

10:43.672 --> 10:45.422
- That's almost in my mouth?
- Yeah.

10:45.507 --> 10:48.261
My friend just got her period
and she doesn't have any tampons

10:48.296 --> 10:50.227
and it's first-day flow.

10:50.345 --> 10:51.812
Really heavy, and her
underpants are filling and...

10:51.897 --> 10:53.680
- Just take it.
- Thank you.

10:53.816 --> 10:54.681
I do have one.

10:54.817 --> 10:56.316
Hold on, let me get my Longchamp.

10:56.401 --> 10:57.517
Oh, yes!

10:57.653 --> 11:00.437
♪

11:00.522 --> 11:02.689
♪ Banging 'til the
bells stop ringing ♪

11:05.694 --> 11:07.351
Can you please return to your seat?

11:07.386 --> 11:09.162
- Again.
- Yes, sorry.

11:09.248 --> 11:10.864
I was just, um, gathering materials.

11:10.999 --> 11:12.833
Okay. Thank you.

11:15.037 --> 11:16.837
(sighing)

11:16.922 --> 11:18.789
(laughing)

11:18.874 --> 11:20.123
You're kidding, right?

11:20.209 --> 11:21.208
What do you mean?

11:21.343 --> 11:23.093
Oh, you're serious?

11:23.212 --> 11:26.668
I thought that these, were, like,
a joke that all women shared.

11:27.099 --> 11:28.381
I guess I'm just the monster

11:28.517 --> 11:31.551
with a humongous vagina over here.

11:31.687 --> 11:34.304
(bleep) you, Lindsay.

11:34.389 --> 11:36.737
Does yarmulke size have
anything to do with dick si...

11:36.772 --> 11:38.225
Sorry, shlong size?

11:38.360 --> 11:39.976
I think so.

11:40.062 --> 11:41.394
Then it is way too big.

11:41.530 --> 11:42.813
But can I borrow this yarmulke?

11:42.898 --> 11:44.898
You're probably not gonna
want it back afterwards.

11:45.033 --> 11:46.316
It's just so thick.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.485
Oh!

11:48.570 --> 11:49.870
I'm so glad you're
finally getting into it.

11:49.955 --> 11:51.238
This is David 5,

11:51.373 --> 11:52.823
he's in his third year
of orthopedic residency...

11:52.908 --> 11:54.157
Wait, do you have a tampon?

11:54.243 --> 11:55.659
N-no, why...

11:55.744 --> 11:56.910
Do you have any interest

11:57.045 --> 11:58.829
in meeting eligible
young Jews on this trip?

11:58.914 --> 12:00.497
Yeah, that was the first thing I said,

12:00.582 --> 12:02.582
that I wanted to join
the Moyel Chai Club.

12:02.668 --> 12:05.001
And why don't you just
let it happen naturally?

12:05.087 --> 12:07.254
Jews are so horny.

12:07.339 --> 12:09.256
Horny.

12:09.391 --> 12:10.257
Oh, my...

12:10.342 --> 12:11.675
- That's offensive.
- Sorry.

12:11.760 --> 12:15.645
Look, forgive me if I want to perpetuate
the glorious bloodline of the Jewish people.

12:15.764 --> 12:17.073
It's a noble cause.

12:17.108 --> 12:18.648
Really? That's your thing?

12:22.321 --> 12:24.020
All right, look, I probably
shouldn't tell you this,

12:24.106 --> 12:26.439
but I get a commission
off of every match made.

12:26.575 --> 12:29.025
I get double if it's made
before we touch the ground.

12:29.111 --> 12:30.998
- What?
- Hey, don't judge.

12:31.033 --> 12:33.616
Look, it's one thing if you don't
want to take this trip seriously,

12:33.651 --> 12:35.254
besmirch your Jewish heritage,

12:35.289 --> 12:36.783
that's between you and HaShem.

12:36.919 --> 12:38.585
But if you get between
me and my money...

12:38.670 --> 12:39.836
(inhaling deeply)

12:39.955 --> 12:41.588
That I will not stand for.

12:48.297 --> 12:49.679
This is so against the rules.

12:49.798 --> 12:52.966
Well, I won't Tel Aviv, if you won't.

12:53.101 --> 12:54.184
Wait a minute, you know Aviv?

12:54.303 --> 12:56.102
No, um...

12:56.188 --> 12:57.387
No.

12:57.472 --> 12:58.722
Oh.

12:58.807 --> 13:00.140
(zipper unzips) Oh.

13:00.275 --> 13:02.893
Holy sweet mother of Moses.

13:02.978 --> 13:03.944
(knocking on door)

13:04.029 --> 13:05.278
Uh...

13:05.364 --> 13:06.479
Coming!

13:06.615 --> 13:09.783
I gotta go, I gotta go!

13:09.868 --> 13:11.284
Uh...

13:11.370 --> 13:13.703
I... I would, uh...

13:13.822 --> 13:15.238
Just a minute, wait a minute.

13:15.324 --> 13:17.184
There's somebody still
finishing in there.

13:17.219 --> 13:18.258
Excuse me.

13:21.997 --> 13:23.997
Dude, I just joined the Moyel Chai Club!

13:24.132 --> 13:26.750
Dude, I've been waiting
for the bathroom forever.

13:26.835 --> 13:27.801
Did you get me anything?

13:27.886 --> 13:29.719
Remember, the wad up the lips?

13:29.838 --> 13:31.338
I got you something better.

13:32.674 --> 13:33.640
What is that?

13:33.725 --> 13:35.175
It's a homemade tampon.

13:35.310 --> 13:40.680
Because I am a woman who has
access to tampons normally,

13:40.816 --> 13:42.849
I'm not gonna stick a pita up my pussy.

13:42.935 --> 13:45.185
I get it.

13:45.270 --> 13:48.772
Everyone is gonna be sorry they
turned their backs on their sisters.

13:48.857 --> 13:50.106
Time is of the essence.

13:50.192 --> 13:51.942
Any second, there's
gonna be an explosion

13:52.027 --> 13:55.028
and there's gonna be
blood, like, everywhere.

13:55.113 --> 13:56.529
Holy...

13:57.437 --> 13:58.832
My headline.

14:01.243 --> 14:02.659
They said "explosion".

14:02.744 --> 14:03.993
They're clearly plotting something.

14:04.079 --> 14:05.829
We need to call dispatch.

14:05.914 --> 14:07.428
No, we're gonna do it.

14:07.463 --> 14:09.833
(gasps) For my reunion.

14:09.918 --> 14:10.884
Okay.

14:10.969 --> 14:12.085
Let's do it.

14:12.170 --> 14:14.587
If we don't die, it's perfect.

14:16.424 --> 14:17.974
Okay.

14:19.494 --> 14:21.561
- Yes!
- She said yes!

14:22.748 --> 14:23.997
What?

14:24.132 --> 14:25.915
I'm buying champagne!

14:26.001 --> 14:27.500
I guess he brought that ring.

14:27.636 --> 14:28.908
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

14:28.943 --> 14:29.586
Cheers.

14:29.671 --> 14:31.370
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

14:31.405 --> 14:32.756
Ew.

14:32.841 --> 14:35.058
(Abbi gasps) Oh, my God, Ilana, look.

14:35.177 --> 14:36.342
<i>Holy yas.</i>

14:36.478 --> 14:38.928
So warm and moist.

14:39.014 --> 14:40.814
Ew, what, dude?

14:40.899 --> 14:43.233
That's not how to describe a tampon.

14:43.351 --> 14:45.652
Tampons, genius!

14:48.724 --> 14:50.423
(Winona) We're gonna take 'em down.

14:50.559 --> 14:51.655
I can get the goods

14:51.690 --> 14:53.310
if you create a diversion.

14:53.428 --> 14:55.562
I am great at diversions.

14:55.647 --> 14:57.701
Like, I'm really good at spilling stuff,

14:57.736 --> 14:58.982
and then people stare.

14:59.101 --> 15:02.803
Like, it's not usually on purpose,
but I think that I can swing it.

15:02.838 --> 15:04.270
Shabbat Shalom, mother (bleep).

15:04.356 --> 15:05.610
Yeah! Let's do this!

15:05.645 --> 15:07.691
Yes! (gasping)

15:07.776 --> 15:09.159
Oh, man.

15:09.277 --> 15:10.410
He's a heavy sleeper.

15:10.495 --> 15:11.778
Yeah, he's dead asleep.

15:11.913 --> 15:12.779
- Okay.
- Okay.

15:12.914 --> 15:14.948
(both) Let's do this!

15:15.083 --> 15:16.866
We got this.

15:16.952 --> 15:18.201
I love you.

15:18.286 --> 15:19.536
Okay.

15:19.621 --> 15:22.872
I have to be honest
be... before we do this.

15:22.958 --> 15:25.592
I lost 200 pounds in two years,

15:25.677 --> 15:26.876
and you never said anything.

15:26.962 --> 15:28.461
I beat cancer, and come on,

15:28.597 --> 15:30.296
I was on "Extreme Couponing".

15:30.432 --> 15:33.800
We never talk about me!

15:33.935 --> 15:36.469
So, yes, I love you,

15:36.605 --> 15:37.854
but I don't like you.

15:40.942 --> 15:42.275
I'm okay with that.

15:43.695 --> 15:44.611
Okay.

15:44.696 --> 15:45.612
Let's do this.

Class of '96!

17:06.194 --> 17:07.193
Explain it again.

17:07.279 --> 17:09.695
My friend was just
trying to get me a tampon.

17:09.781 --> 17:11.614
Your stories are inconsistent.

17:11.733 --> 17:14.983
So we wake up in Wantagh, New Jersey.

17:15.069 --> 17:16.986
Abbi's puking on the side of the road.

17:17.071 --> 17:18.371
No cabs anywhere.

17:18.457 --> 17:20.406
This is our second date, mind you.

17:20.541 --> 17:23.159
She wouldn't call it a date, but, uh...

17:23.244 --> 17:24.577
(laughing) We scheme.

17:24.713 --> 17:26.546
We do scheme.

17:26.631 --> 17:28.832
Your partner hasn't
mentioned a tampon once.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.728
Sir, your guess is as good as mine.

17:30.763 --> 17:31.852
(Israeli soldier) You're on Birthmarc,

17:31.887 --> 17:36.256
yet your friend sang a Christian
song to create a diversion.

17:36.391 --> 17:37.640
Is she even Jewish?

17:37.759 --> 17:39.759
Honestly, your guess is as good as mine.

17:39.895 --> 17:42.878
Why did you move seats
to sit next to a dead man?

17:42.913 --> 17:44.731
- That's suspicious.
- What? No, no.

17:44.816 --> 17:46.149
He... He was sleeping.

17:46.268 --> 17:48.268
You...

17:48.353 --> 17:49.621
Oh, my God.

17:49.656 --> 17:50.576
The dead guy?

17:50.611 --> 17:51.772
Yeah, fully dead.

17:51.807 --> 17:55.441
Nobody wanted the seats and we had to
sit next to each other, obviously, so...

17:55.577 --> 17:57.076
Yeah, it didn't bother me at all.

17:57.162 --> 17:58.945
You said your bag was the bomb.

17:59.030 --> 18:02.448
It is, my bag is the bom...

18:02.534 --> 18:05.585
Okay, Google "Refinery 29,"

18:05.670 --> 18:07.921
in quotes, "Drew Barrymore," in quotes.

18:08.006 --> 18:09.422
It's a life-changing bag,

18:09.508 --> 18:12.425
You were asking passengers
for very strange instruments.

18:12.511 --> 18:14.961
Twine, someone's shoelaces,
heavy duty scissors.

18:15.096 --> 18:16.629
To make a tampon.

18:16.715 --> 18:18.548
What, do you think I was
making a (bleep) bomb?

18:18.633 --> 18:19.499
Yeah!

18:19.585 --> 18:21.301
You're here for suspicion
of terrorist activity.

18:21.436 --> 18:24.218
Terrorism? I thought this was
about the weed in my pussy.

18:28.302 --> 18:29.777
What?

18:30.979 --> 18:33.646
God, there's so much
turbulence, what is going on?

18:33.782 --> 18:35.815
It's the pilots giving each other head.

18:35.951 --> 18:36.983
Air head.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.356
That's a good one.

18:38.391 --> 18:39.152
Seriously.

18:39.237 --> 18:41.327
Why do you think they
call it the cockpit?

18:41.362 --> 18:43.122
(moaning)

18:44.459 --> 18:45.658
(bleep) yeah.

18:45.794 --> 18:49.461
There is just something
about doing it in the sky.

18:56.035 --> 18:58.485
So, listen, you know how I wanted
to come on this trip to, like,

18:58.604 --> 19:01.355
experience some sort
of spiritual epiphany?

19:01.390 --> 19:02.022
Yeah?

19:02.108 --> 19:06.443
So when the stewardess
slammed me down on the ground,

19:06.529 --> 19:09.079
for a moment, I swear I had this, like,

19:09.165 --> 19:14.451
out-of-body experience
where I was in... heaven.

19:14.537 --> 19:16.370
You know Jews don't have heaven.

19:16.455 --> 19:18.455
Well, I saw Jesus.

19:18.591 --> 19:19.790
You saw Jesus?

19:19.875 --> 19:21.592
I saw Jesus.

19:21.677 --> 19:24.711
And he was hot and he had a man
bun and he was wearing sandals,

19:24.797 --> 19:27.047
and I usually hate
sandals and I loved 'em.

19:27.133 --> 19:30.300
Dude, he's like a Jew,
but he's not Jew-ish.

19:30.436 --> 19:31.602
Really good for me.

19:31.687 --> 19:33.804
The more you talk about it...

19:33.939 --> 19:35.139
the more right it is.

19:35.274 --> 19:37.474
You know, I really
liked your intro before.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.978
I was thinking about it, like,
using this trip to find yourself

19:41.063 --> 19:42.646
and find your purpose.

19:42.782 --> 19:44.148
And then when my face was pressed

19:44.283 --> 19:48.952
into the plush carpet of first
class, I had this a-ha moment.

19:49.038 --> 19:53.574
I, like, realized what
I wanna do with my life.

19:53.659 --> 19:55.993
Ilana, this is huge.

19:56.128 --> 19:59.413
I want to make enough
money to fly first class.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.397
- Yeah, dude, that's it.
- Right?

20:02.432 --> 20:04.247
- Yeah, I'm in.
- No touching.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.837
And my Birthmarc wish came true.

20:06.972 --> 20:07.971
Now we're sitting together.

20:08.057 --> 20:10.641
And I got to fly with my bag.

20:10.726 --> 20:11.892
And it really is incredible.

20:12.011 --> 20:13.594
It withstood all those bullet holes.

20:13.679 --> 20:16.480
Yeah, Israelis, like,
really love their guns.

20:16.565 --> 20:18.098
Guns are so gross.

20:18.184 --> 20:19.683
I'm really relieved
we're going back home.

20:19.768 --> 20:22.436
Totally.

20:23.522 --> 20:26.156
(plane rattling)

20:26.242 --> 20:28.659
(pilot moaning)

20:28.744 --> 20:30.661
Dassit.

20:30.746 --> 20:32.613
There's actually this
restaurant on Steinway

20:32.698 --> 20:36.500
that makes falafel that
I heard is even better

20:36.585 --> 20:37.868
than the real deal.

20:38.003 --> 20:39.036
Let's just go there.

20:39.171 --> 20:40.287
Yum.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.539
That sounds perfect.

20:42.625 --> 20:46.210
Ugh, I miss New York.

20:46.295 --> 20:48.846
Wait, so Jesus is a god, right?

20:48.931 --> 20:52.049
God is, like, Daddy God and
Jesus is like, the Son God.

20:52.134 --> 20:54.635
So he's really just,
like, a hot rich kid.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.286
Totally.
