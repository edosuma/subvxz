00:15.766 --> 00:17.309
She's my niece. Jackie.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.144

00:26.694 --> 00:28.570
Hey, Iz. Yeah.

Everything all right?

You think she's gonna come?

01:14.324 --> 01:16.952
It's so porn-y.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.621

01:19.663 --> 01:21.999

01:22.041 --> 01:23.625

01:23.667 --> 01:25.419

01:27.379 --> 01:29.673

of your house, peeking in your windows.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.259
Said he was looking for his girlfriend.

19:37.301 --> 19:40.387
Hey, once again, I didn't use the word "girlfriend."

19:40.429 --> 19:41.931
-Yes, he did. -Andy, why --

19:41.973 --> 19:44.017
why are you... Why'd you follow me here

19:44.058 --> 19:47.269
to   Right.

19:47.311 --> 19:50.272
Uncle Jack. I know you said

19:47.311 --> 19:50.272
you weren't feeling well,

19:50.314 --> 19:52.650
which, you know, wasn't entirely surprising

19:52.692 --> 19:54.735
considering the pizza intake.

19:54.777 --> 19:56.487
You weren't dressed in the window.

19:56.529 --> 19:58.447
He wasn't dressed. -Mnh-mnh.

19:59.657 --> 20:01.325
It was...

20:01.367 --> 20:03.369
You're sure it wasn't the reflection in the...

20:01.367 --> 20:03.369
No.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.706
Saw your...

20:06.747 --> 20:08.290
My one nip

20:08.332 --> 20:09.750
It's a great shirt.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.794
I've never even seen this guy before.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.630
You never even talked about him, and, like,

20:14.672 --> 20:16.465
all of a sudden, you get a text, you say you're sick,

20:16.507 --> 20:18.009
and then you sneak off to his house?

20:18.051 --> 20:19.468
Like, what's going on?

20:19.510 --> 20:22.180
You know, conversely, none of us had ever heard of

20:22.221 --> 20:25.516
nor seen her before, what, uh, three days ago?

20:25.558 --> 20:26.642
Three days ago. -Yeah.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.604
Maybe -- Maybe they did drift apart.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.982
Maybe there are some complex family dynamics

20:33.024 --> 20:35.902
that we simply don't feel obligated to share with you.

20:35.943 --> 20:38.237
Okay, riddle me this, Trakarskys.

20:38.278 --> 20:39.655
If she is your niece,

20:39.697 --> 20:41.157

20:41.199 --> 20:42.909
to go and visit her own family?

20:42.950 --> 20:45.327
Hmm? -Yeah.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.829
Yeah. Good one, Lori.

20:46.871 --> 20:48.288
I was actually wondering the exact same thing.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.456
Happy Halloween!

20:51.167 --> 20:52.668
Boom.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.336
When I was like... Four--

20:54.378 --> 20:57.965
...14, Jack scared the shit out of me...

20:54.378 --> 20:57.965
14.

20:58.007 --> 20:59.675
Like... ...and my friends

20:58.007 --> 20:59.675
wearing this, so...

20:59.717 --> 21:01.677
Same mask. I snuck her in.

21:01.719 --> 21:03.804
She hid in the closet with this.

21:03.846 --> 21:04.889
It was --

21:04.931 --> 21:06.099
It was epic. Yep.

21:06.140 --> 21:07.600
Jack peed his pants.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.437
What? -I didn't pee my pants.

21:11.478 --> 21:13.231
It was like, uh, I spilled something on...

21:13.272 --> 21:15.524
Jack, you pissed your pants?

21:15.566 --> 21:16.943
That is fucking awesome!

21:16.984 --> 21:18.694
I didn't pee my pants. It's part of the lore.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.029
Don't fight it, honey.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.989
Why was that necessary? It's happening.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.574
Okay, so, that's it. We can wrap this up.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.367
Or do you guys want to go home and get your, uh,

21:25.409 --> 21:27.494
torches and pitchforks?

21:27.536 --> 21:28.955
What? No, no.

21:28.996 --> 21:32.666
I was being a good neighbor! I mean, if --

21:32.708 --> 21:37.755
if one of you sees a stranger peering in my window,

21:37.797 --> 21:40.133
I would hope you would have the decency to say,

21:40.174 --> 21:41.592
"Hey, Lori.

21:41.634 --> 21:43.385
You need to know there's a creepy man lookin'

21:43.427 --> 21:45.972
in your window," and not just sit there and laugh at me.

21:46.013 --> 21:47.598
It's -- It's all good, Lori.

21:47.640 --> 21:51.227
I mean, this is gonna make a great story for everyone.

21:51.269 --> 21:55.022
You know who would really enjoy this particular anecdote?

21:55.064 --> 21:57.942
Uh, Lisa Sangster.

21:57.984 --> 22:01.821
Wait. Isn't she on the Hamilton alumni board with you?

22:01.862 --> 22:03.322

22:03.363 --> 22:05.407
Um, you're friends?

22:05.449 --> 22:07.409
