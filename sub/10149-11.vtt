01:08.236 --> 01:09.737
<i>Previously</i> on Batman Beyond...

01:10.196 --> 01:12.031
The R12 thermal bomb.

01:12.365 --> 01:13.991
I believe
that's government property.

01:20.248 --> 01:22.643
<i>You're thinking, "How could
he let Kobra get away with a bomb</i>

01:22.667 --> 01:24.267
<i>that can incinerate half the East Side?"</i>

01:24.502 --> 01:27.463
Actually, I was thinking
you should meet an old friend of mine.

01:27.713 --> 01:28.756
Hyah!

01:29.966 --> 01:31.050
<i>Bruce was right.</i>

01:31.133 --> 01:33.427
<i>You've got the moves, kid,
but you lack discipline.</i>

01:34.053 --> 01:36.305
<i>And you leave yourself open
on the left side.</i>

01:37.765 --> 01:38.975
We'll have to work on that.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.477
- Who are you?
- Kairi Tanaga.

01:42.687 --> 01:44.689
Zander is one of my advanced students.

01:48.234 --> 01:49.234
My life is different.

01:49.277 --> 01:51.946
Ever since I was born,
I've been groomed to lead my people.

01:52.321 --> 01:53.364
Max, this is Zander.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.534
Who's bad? Who's rad?

01:56.701 --> 01:58.244
Who's never been had?

01:58.327 --> 01:59.328
Whoo!

01:59.662 --> 02:00.997
Is she always like this?

02:02.999 --> 02:05.293
I think they were recovering
ancient dinosaur DNA.

02:05.668 --> 02:07.712
DNA and thermal bombs?

02:08.087 --> 02:09.130
What's the connection?

02:09.547 --> 02:11.007
- Hail Kobra.
- Hail Kobra.

02:11.841 --> 02:14.218
I assure you
that preparations are nearly complete.

02:17.805 --> 02:19.223
How much more time do we have?

02:19.473 --> 02:20.913
<i>There's one last thing I want to do.</i>

02:21.267 --> 02:23.602
- Zander?
- Come with me. Now.

02:23.853 --> 02:24.895
<i>Get away from me!</i>

02:26.230 --> 02:28.107
Terry, get over to Max's, and hurry!

02:28.649 --> 02:29.775
Max?

02:55.468 --> 02:56.468
You're lucky.

02:56.635 --> 02:59.513
It was just a minor concussion
and four cracked ribs.

03:00.639 --> 03:01.682
Only four?

03:01.766 --> 03:02.975
They'll hurt when you move.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.353
And breathing won't be much fun, either.

03:06.228 --> 03:07.228
Max!

03:07.271 --> 03:08.272
Ohh!

03:08.356 --> 03:09.482
Easy. Easy.

03:09.565 --> 03:12.318
Zander's got Max. I recognized his car.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.694
I gotta get her.

03:13.778 --> 03:15.863
- You're in no condition.
- But I'm her only hope.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.948
Have you forgotten
who you're talking to?

03:47.061 --> 03:49.814
Bruce? You shouldn't sneak up
on people like that.

03:50.022 --> 03:53.401
- Sorry. Old habit.
- Another old habit.

03:53.484 --> 03:55.528
You here for a progress report
on McGinnis?

03:55.736 --> 03:58.406
No. I need to find
another of your students.

03:58.656 --> 03:59.698
His name is Zander.

03:59.949 --> 04:02.618
- What do you want with him?
- He kidnapped someone.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.830
You look disappointed.
But not surprised.

04:06.122 --> 04:08.749
I knew I was taking a chance
when I allowed him in here.

04:08.874 --> 04:10.292
He's in some kind of cult.

04:10.626 --> 04:11.669
I don't know which one,

04:11.752 --> 04:13.546
but they're grooming him
to be their leader.

04:13.671 --> 04:15.798
I wanted to make sure
he wouldn't abuse the power.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.883
So you figured you'd teach him Bushido.

04:18.676 --> 04:20.553
He needed a code. A philosophy.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.263
A sense of right and wrong.

04:22.388 --> 04:24.014
It worked for the samurai warriors.

04:24.348 --> 04:26.100
But obviously not for Zander.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.355
All I have for him is this phone number.

04:36.735 --> 04:38.779
Haven't you ever been wrong?

04:43.701 --> 04:45.119
They're using a blocking code

04:45.202 --> 04:46.882
to keep the phone number
from being traced.

04:47.788 --> 04:49.415
There's got to be a way around it.

04:50.499 --> 04:51.499
How are the ribs?

04:51.542 --> 04:52.894
Well, I'm trying not to move around,

04:52.918 --> 04:55.838
but I still can't figure out
what to do about the breathing thing.

04:56.130 --> 04:58.215
What do you know
about this cult Zander's in?

04:58.466 --> 05:00.306
He wouldn't talk about it.
It was a big secret.

05:00.426 --> 05:02.066
I never should have
introduced him to Max.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.471
Don't blame yourself.

05:03.554 --> 05:05.222
Why not? It's my fault.

05:05.431 --> 05:08.434
I know. But blaming's not productive.

05:08.517 --> 05:11.520
Wait. It looks like
the decoding program's getting through.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.278
Kobra.

05:21.322 --> 05:22.549
Where do you think you're going?

05:22.573 --> 05:23.949
To get Max.

05:24.325 --> 05:26.845
As soon as you find the address
that goes with the phone number.

05:26.869 --> 05:28.287
What about your breathing problem?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.289
I'II breathe on the weekend.

05:45.721 --> 05:47.932
When you arrived here,
your clothes were torn.

05:50.059 --> 05:51.769
Were you involved
in some sort of scuffle?

05:52.061 --> 05:53.395
You might say that.

05:53.771 --> 05:56.148
- Who are you?
- Your servants.

05:56.398 --> 05:58.943
The master told us to stay with you
until you awakened.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.654
The master? Oh, let me guess.

06:04.323 --> 06:05.509
You gonna tell me where we are?

06:05.533 --> 06:07.451
The master will
answer all your questions.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.787
Can you at least tell me
why it's so hot in here?

06:09.954 --> 06:11.038
Air conditioning broke?

06:13.123 --> 06:15.042
- What's so funny?
- It's not hot in here.

06:15.251 --> 06:16.251
This is normal.

06:16.502 --> 06:17.962
Tell that to my antiperspirant.

06:18.170 --> 06:20.172
Please, the master wants to see you.

06:20.339 --> 06:21.619
What if I don't want to see him?

06:21.924 --> 06:23.509
No one refuses him.

06:23.968 --> 06:25.219
This is hopeless.

07:46.342 --> 07:48.594
You overgrown iguana.
Let go of me!

07:57.019 --> 07:58.437
You have no right to...

08:00.689 --> 08:01.689
Max.

08:07.071 --> 08:08.614
I've been waiting for you.

08:21.251 --> 08:22.628
Don't be afraid.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.111
You have to make friends with them.

08:24.171 --> 08:25.589
Idid.

08:28.926 --> 08:33.263
Maybe... Maybe if I knew a little more
about them and you.

08:33.514 --> 08:35.599
Yes. You'll need to.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.148
I'll start at the beginning.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.608
The very beginning.

08:45.150 --> 08:48.195
My DNA was synthesized in a laboratory
50 meters from here.

08:49.655 --> 08:52.825
<i>My first nine months were spent
in an artificial womb.</i>

08:52.908 --> 08:56.161
<i>All the nutrients I received
were carefully monitored and purified.</i>

08:59.832 --> 09:02.876
<i>From early childhood
I had nearly round the clock tutoring.</i>

09:03.877 --> 09:06.672
<i>I was trained in a multitude
of military strategies,</i>

09:06.797 --> 09:09.383
<i>as well as martial arts
and advanced weaponry.</i>

09:20.227 --> 09:23.021
<i>Everything Kobra did for me
had one goal,</i>

09:23.188 --> 09:25.065
<i>to make me their perfect leader.</i>

09:28.569 --> 09:29.403
Well?

09:29.528 --> 09:31.881
They should have made a girlfriend
for you while they were at it.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.185
She wouldn't have been like you.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.701
Yeah, but you wouldn't
have needed to kidnap her.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.414
It's an honor to be brought
to the leader of Kobra.

09:40.664 --> 09:42.958
I don't care if you're the leader
of the whole free world.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.585
You're nothing but a crook to me.

09:49.298 --> 09:50.799
I told you it would never work.

09:51.300 --> 09:54.178
- I'II have her eliminated.
- No. I like her.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.723
She's so different from these
mindless automatons I'm surrounded by.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.684
She's... She's a person.

10:01.310 --> 10:02.478
That's the problem.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.689
Doctor, what I want, I get.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.160
I double-checked
that address you gave me.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.953
It's a toxic waste company.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.246
Or so they say.

10:21.330 --> 10:23.975
Can you think of a better way
to make people want to avoid the place?

10:23.999 --> 10:24.999
Call it a high school?

10:46.021 --> 10:49.191
What you don't seem to understand
is that I'm offering you the future.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.442
The future?

10:51.777 --> 10:54.988
If this guy's any indication,
all you got to offer is the past.

10:55.280 --> 10:56.824
About 100 million years of it.

10:57.074 --> 10:58.951
Dinosaurs once ruled the world.

10:59.034 --> 11:00.744
They had strength, size...

11:00.953 --> 11:04.122
But they weren't too swift in
the adaptability department, were they?

11:04.206 --> 11:06.291
No. That's where humans came in.

11:06.583 --> 11:10.712
For years, we've been working on ways
to combine human DNA with dinosaur's.

11:10.963 --> 11:12.297
The goal is to create a life form

11:12.381 --> 11:14.967
that will dominate the world
for the next million years.

11:15.259 --> 11:16.552
I think I get it now.

11:18.262 --> 11:20.639
- You do?
- Yeah. You're crazy.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.350
All of you.
Certifiable, in need of medication.

11:23.767 --> 11:25.894
You think I'm deluded? Come with me.

11:34.570 --> 11:35.570
Just in time.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.062
Ugh!

12:09.146 --> 12:11.106
Where's some body lotion
when you need it?

12:11.481 --> 12:12.691
This is serious!

12:12.900 --> 12:14.192
You think it's hot in here now?

12:14.276 --> 12:15.903
Wait fill that thermal bomb goes off.

12:16.111 --> 12:17.714
What do you think
that's gonna accomplish?

12:17.738 --> 12:19.031
It'II start a chain reaction

12:19.114 --> 12:21.074
that” raise the temperature
of the whole planet.

12:21.325 --> 12:24.620
Because reptiles are cold-blooded
and you'll need the extra heat.

12:24.828 --> 12:25.828
Exactly.

12:25.871 --> 12:28.874
And what do you think
that heat will do to the human race?

12:29.124 --> 12:31.043
I'm giving you a chance to survive.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.502
Your only chance.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.714
As a lizard? Thanks, but no thanks.

12:35.923 --> 12:38.425
You'll feel differently later.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.803
The rewiring's done.
It's ready to be detonated.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.097
If you'll excuse me.

12:53.607 --> 12:54.900
Splice her.

13:07.746 --> 13:09.831
I'm telling you, it's a big mistake.

13:10.165 --> 13:13.585
She's rude, she's sarcastic
and she has absolutely no respect.

13:13.835 --> 13:14.920
Gotta be Max.

13:15.253 --> 13:16.964
Careful what you say, Doctor.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.216
You might be taking orders
from her someday.

13:21.176 --> 13:25.555
Believe me, that's not the kind of woman
you want to share your life with.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.932
But when the splicing's done,

13:27.015 --> 13:29.184
she won't really be
just a woman anymore, will she?

13:34.439 --> 13:36.274
Get that away from me!
Get it away!

13:42.197 --> 13:43.365
Aah! Aah!

13:43.448 --> 13:44.574
The ribs.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.411
- Sorry.
- Nice outfit.

13:47.619 --> 13:50.789
Yeah. Next to your pal, Zander,
you seem almost normal.

13:50.956 --> 13:52.236
What was he trying to do to you?

13:52.416 --> 13:53.792
Turn me into a dinosaur.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.627
- What?
- I'II explain later.

13:55.711 --> 13:57.546
Earthquake?

13:57.879 --> 13:59.589
We're not waiting around
to find out.

14:07.639 --> 14:08.724
Stand back.

14:24.573 --> 14:26.033
This is not good.

14:34.499 --> 14:37.395
As soon as I get you down from here
I can come back in the Batmobile and...

14:37.419 --> 14:38.962
Wait. The bomb. I forgot.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.526
- What about it?
- They're going to...

14:40.630 --> 14:41.715
Hey!

14:54.394 --> 14:55.394
Aah!

14:57.606 --> 14:58.606
Aah!

15:09.659 --> 15:11.139
What I was trying to tell you before,

15:11.244 --> 15:12.954
they're getting ready
to set off the bomb.

15:14.039 --> 15:15.540
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

15:15.707 --> 15:17.125
But the control room's that way.

15:22.839 --> 15:24.317
Oh, come on, you're not gonna make me...

15:24.341 --> 15:26.468
Yes, I am. Got a problem with it?

15:28.303 --> 15:30.639
Only the same one I always have.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.185
It looks so peaceful,
doesn't it?

15:35.393 --> 15:38.188
Hasn't erupted in over 2,000 years.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.524
Who'd ever know that
it's standing right on top

15:40.607 --> 15:43.276
of a rift that goes halfway
to the earth's core?

15:43.568 --> 15:46.696
Everyone will know,
as soon as we drop that.

15:51.743 --> 15:53.912
Once you do, there's no turning back.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.373
The magma will come to the surface and...

15:56.456 --> 16:00.085
Doctor, this is the moment
I've been trained for all my life.

16:00.168 --> 16:01.628
I am more than ready.

16:03.255 --> 16:05.006
The mammals have had their chance.

16:07.050 --> 16:09.344
Now, it's the age of Kobra.

16:09.803 --> 16:10.803
Aah!

16:11.721 --> 16:13.473
Have you thought
about what you're doing?

16:13.765 --> 16:15.125
This will be the end of the world.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.726
Your world, you mean.

16:18.770 --> 16:19.855
It's yours, too.

16:25.694 --> 16:29.364
These people tried to raise you
without family or friends or love.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.676
But you couldn't get along
without those things, could you?

16:31.700 --> 16:33.660
You're right. It was my weakness.

17:28.423 --> 17:29.507
Why isn't it working?

17:29.799 --> 17:31.092
I... I don't know.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.430
The control module.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.140
The bomb has been deactivated.

17:49.819 --> 17:51.279
I failed you, Zander.

17:51.363 --> 17:53.323
I thought I could
put you on the right path.

17:53.782 --> 17:56.868
Failed me? You've destroyed me.

17:57.327 --> 17:58.578
Without the heat from that bomb

17:58.662 --> 18:01.122
how long do you think
I'll be able to survive like this?

18:03.541 --> 18:05.418
You've chosen your own path, kid.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.304
You really don't like the cold, do you?

18:26.982 --> 18:27.983
Ha!

18:40.245 --> 18:41.245
Look out!

18:49.421 --> 18:50.505
The escape pods!

19:03.393 --> 19:05.020
This one's taken.

19:06.980 --> 19:08.606
Kind of cold in here now, isn't it?

19:08.940 --> 19:10.525
But I guess you've already noticed.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.153
They've got escape pods.

19:13.236 --> 19:14.821
I saw them when I sneaked in.

19:14.904 --> 19:15.904
They're down there.

19:15.947 --> 19:18.241
I'll meet you there.
I gotta find someone first.

19:23.288 --> 19:24.289
Oh!

19:31.963 --> 19:33.882
Max! Max!

19:35.842 --> 19:37.635
Max! Max!

19:38.094 --> 19:39.094
Over here!

19:39.512 --> 19:40.555
What took you?

19:40.889 --> 19:42.557
- Where's Kairi?
- Would that be her?

19:50.482 --> 19:52.442
He's behind you! Run!

19:53.985 --> 19:56.738
Too late. Keep your guard up, kid.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.199
Particularly on your left side.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.609
She was a good teacher.

20:35.276 --> 20:36.611
The best.

20:38.113 --> 20:40.907
- Chilly.
- Feels good.
