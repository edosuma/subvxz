01:55.865 --> 01:59.257
- Positive reinforcement works.
- I prefer negative.

01:59.281 --> 02:02.844
The silent treatment, the cold shoulder.
Make people squirm, they'll perform.

02:02.868 --> 02:05.091
It's also an acceptable form
of human conduct.

02:05.115 --> 02:06.892
Which I want nothing to do with.

02:06.916 --> 02:09.301
You know, like IMing,
or popping and locking.

02:09.326 --> 02:12.149
Whatever. It's still the best
operations report you will ever see,

02:12.173 --> 02:15.543
- whether you want to admit it or not.
- Let me see this.

02:16.844 --> 02:18.018
Wow.

02:18.042 --> 02:19.525
This is nice.

02:19.549 --> 02:22.189
You got colour-coded tabs.
You got highlighted bullet points.

02:22.213 --> 02:24.693
- Excuse me.
- Wait a minute.

02:24.717 --> 02:26.198
Did your mom help you with this?

02:26.222 --> 02:28.863
I warned you about
bringing up my mom.

02:28.887 --> 02:32.019
It's very nice.
I'm sure Hetty will give you a gold star.

02:32.235 --> 02:34.203
I can't wait to see
what you did for science fair.

02:34.227 --> 02:37.001
- Maybe we ought to build a volcano.
- Maybe I should...

02:37.025 --> 02:39.736
- Throw me in one?
- That's not what I was gonna say.

02:40.368 --> 02:42.917
Well, I'm glad to see you two
are closer than ever.

02:42.941 --> 02:45.173
Mike Renko, back from the dead.

02:45.197 --> 02:49.347
- Hey, how was the vacation?
- Ah. Very funny. Answer me this.

02:49.371 --> 02:52.093
How come I'm squatting in a bush
for two months, smacking bugs,

02:52.117 --> 02:54.395
while you guys are out cruising
the beaches?

02:54.419 --> 02:56.524
Well, I guess you have a face for it.

02:56.548 --> 02:58.212
Smoke out any bad guys?

02:58.553 --> 03:02.028
I've been chasing this militia group.
They call themselves ELE.

03:02.052 --> 03:05.140
- Enhancing Law Enforcement.
- Mm.

03:05.351 --> 03:08.411
Yeah. It's been a tough one,
but I finally got an informant.

03:08.435 --> 03:12.104
Hopefully he can help us link them
to weapons missing from Pendleton.

03:12.483 --> 03:15.460
Hmm. Looks like you got
your bunkmate back, G.

03:15.484 --> 03:17.171
Love Boat sails again.

03:17.195 --> 03:18.750
Not with me onboard.

03:18.774 --> 03:22.151
I'll be staying with a friend.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.908
- Right.
- Wait a minute.

03:26.205 --> 03:29.574
Back in town less than 24 hours
and you're staying with a friend?

03:30.585 --> 03:31.841
- It's...
- Astonishing.

03:31.865 --> 03:35.555
Astonishing that a person of such
modest appearances and charm...

03:35.579 --> 03:37.132
Questionable personal hygiene

03:37.550 --> 03:39.898
is, you know,
racking up tail like, you know.

03:39.922 --> 03:42.526
Hetty, wants you. Upstairs.

03:42.550 --> 03:45.391
Oh, she said one point
for whoever gets up here first.

03:51.731 --> 03:53.558
Oh, hey. Whoa.

04:00.448 --> 04:02.547
Are you punking us?
Because you better not be.

04:02.571 --> 04:05.125
- No, sir, I would not do that.
- Then where is she?

04:05.149 --> 04:07.261
I'm everywhere, Mr. Renko.

04:07.285 --> 04:11.014
Or have you been on assignment
so long you've forgotten?

04:11.038 --> 04:12.216
She's in Washington.

04:12.240 --> 04:17.934
I apologise for not being with you,
but the political world beckons.

04:17.958 --> 04:22.058
Of course, our work doesn't stop
while Washington tinkers.

04:22.082 --> 04:23.542
So let's get to it.

04:23.888 --> 04:26.842
Uh, Mr. Beale, please play the tape.

04:27.683 --> 04:31.075
The man against the glass
is a Marine reservist

04:31.099 --> 04:34.271
who worked at an armoury
at Camp Pendleton.

04:35.358 --> 04:37.125
Does anybody else
think this is weird?

04:37.149 --> 04:39.619
- Oh, yeah. We all think it's weird.
- Just checking.

04:39.643 --> 04:42.501
- Heard that, Mr. Callen.
- How?

04:42.525 --> 04:44.667
Marine Lance Corporal
Edward Mackaye.

04:44.691 --> 04:48.923
Mackaye was garrotted
at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium.

04:48.947 --> 04:53.309
The entire incident was caught
on something called a Fishcam,

04:53.333 --> 04:56.762
which broadcasts 24/7
on the Internet.

04:56.786 --> 05:01.067
Now this Mackaye, he's a reservist.
Wouldn't that be a case for local P. D?

05:01.091 --> 05:03.500
I'll leave that for Mr. Renko
to explain.

05:03.886 --> 05:06.721
The case is yours, Mr. Callen.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.803
Mackaye wasn't just punching
a timecard.

05:11.352 --> 05:14.199
He was my informant on
the weapons case I've been following.

05:14.223 --> 05:16.188
I've got it all here.

05:16.482 --> 05:20.835
Over a three-month period, six Dragon
anti-tank missiles disappeared,

05:20.859 --> 05:24.563
somewhere between the manufacturer
and Afghanistan.

05:26.784 --> 05:30.544
Interchangeable warheads,
small, portable scary as hell.

05:30.568 --> 05:32.964
We narrowed it down
to an armoury at Pendleton.

05:32.988 --> 05:35.846
Prime suspect is Private Scott Riley.

05:35.870 --> 05:39.305
Riley is very smart. We've not been
able to hang anything on this guy.

05:39.329 --> 05:42.708
Haven't been able to figure out how
he got the Dragon off the base.

05:43.467 --> 05:45.425
Eric, pull up everything you've got
on Mackaye.

05:45.761 --> 05:47.113
Yeah.

05:47.137 --> 05:49.522
That's when we approached
Corporal Mackaye.

05:49.546 --> 05:52.404
Good Marine, standup kid.

05:52.428 --> 05:54.654
He worked in the armoury
with Riley.

05:54.678 --> 05:57.237
Mackaye was supposed to be
eyes and ears only.

05:57.261 --> 05:59.539
Let us know if Riley was up
to anything suspicious.

05:59.563 --> 06:01.833
And how is this connected
to the militia group?

06:01.857 --> 06:05.112
We knew ELE was in the market
for heavy firepower.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.666
I've been trying to track down
their base for months

06:07.690 --> 06:11.046
but these guys just keep moving
around. Mostly border areas.

06:11.070 --> 06:13.712
- Just like the coyotes.
- Exactly.

06:13.736 --> 06:17.284
Illegals come across,
ELE is right there waiting for them.

06:17.919 --> 06:21.014
We pulled phone records
going back a decade.

06:21.038 --> 06:23.918
Turns out our Private Riley
has a history

06:24.216 --> 06:26.269
with two of ELE's suspected leaders.

06:26.293 --> 06:30.277
This is Malcolm Tallridge,
the charismatic founder.

06:30.301 --> 06:34.696
His number two, John Bordinay,
a paranoid nut job.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.364
Brains and muscle.

06:36.388 --> 06:39.112
We think that this is Bordinay
behind the gun.

06:39.136 --> 06:42.102
This video was leaked onto the web.

06:45.696 --> 06:48.483
Last summer these guys
chased 20 people into the desert.

06:49.533 --> 06:51.917
All of them died of thirst,
including three children.

06:51.941 --> 06:55.630
It doesn't bother them.
The deaths prove their point.

06:55.654 --> 06:58.844
The situation's out of control
and they need to engage.

06:58.868 --> 07:01.510
They claim to be protecting
our freedom.

07:01.534 --> 07:03.396
We were hoping to lock
these guys down

07:03.420 --> 07:05.688
before they did something
really crazy.

07:05.712 --> 07:08.504
Like arming themselves
with Dragon missiles.

07:09.929 --> 07:12.336
I think maybe they just have.

07:33.175 --> 07:34.943
Welcome to D.C., Henrietta.

07:34.967 --> 07:36.986
Director Vance.

07:37.010 --> 07:40.489
Door-to-door service?
How out of character.

07:40.513 --> 07:43.446
Well, people can change.
And I owe you one, big time.

07:43.470 --> 07:47.665
You do. Especially for forcing me
to leave the children in charge.

07:47.689 --> 07:49.825
How much trouble can they get into
in eight hours?

07:49.849 --> 07:52.623
- Is that how long I'm going to be here?
- Mm-hm.

07:52.647 --> 07:55.963
Good gracious, you told me
they had a few questions

07:55.987 --> 07:59.751
regarding the security
of your slush fund.

07:59.775 --> 08:04.080
Think of it more along the lines
of a friendly fireside chat

08:04.540 --> 08:06.972
about the efficacy
of the funding disbursement process

08:06.996 --> 08:09.244
for the federal joint task force
system.

08:09.545 --> 08:12.558
Why don't they just throw me in a well
and see if I float?

08:12.582 --> 08:14.013
This isn't a witch hunt, Hetty.

08:14.037 --> 08:17.277
Oh, I recall the same thing being said
to my predecessor

08:17.301 --> 08:18.988
before she disappeared.

08:19.012 --> 08:24.470
Last I heard of Macy, she was working
out of a Quonset hut in Djibouti.

08:29.482 --> 08:31.059
Aah!

08:40.868 --> 08:44.094
Mackaye wouldn't have gone
into the aquarium to meet anyone.

08:44.118 --> 08:45.545
Not while it was being cleaned.

08:45.569 --> 08:48.262
Now what I'm thinking is
that someone was after him.

08:48.286 --> 08:51.056
So he goes into the aquarium to hide,
bad guy goes after him,

08:51.080 --> 08:55.179
and, splat, Mackaye makes
his guest appearance on Fishcam.

08:55.203 --> 08:58.146
So Riley comes to the beach,
our eyes and ears follows him.

08:58.170 --> 09:00.728
Eyes and ears gets made.
Bad guy goes rogue.

09:00.752 --> 09:02.945
He panics, takes him out.

09:02.969 --> 09:07.196
Why would the bad guy be here?
I mean, there's no target to attack.

09:07.220 --> 09:09.410
People are too spread out,
it's far too exposed,

09:09.434 --> 09:13.579
and it's lousy with law enforcement
thanks to the port across the way.

09:13.603 --> 09:15.567
- Sam?
- Hmm?

09:15.778 --> 09:18.399
Could you fit a Dragon missile
into a sail bag?

09:18.906 --> 09:20.448
With room to spare.

09:21.242 --> 09:24.172
What are the chances
Riley windsurfs?

09:24.196 --> 09:26.220
Security footage from Pendleton.

09:26.244 --> 09:27.932
So Riley leaves the base in his SUV

09:27.956 --> 09:30.341
with his windsurfing equipment
on the roof rack.

09:30.365 --> 09:33.010
The guards check everything.
The front, the back, everything.

09:33.034 --> 09:35.430
But they never open the sail bag.

09:35.454 --> 09:37.683
Then Riley goes to the
beach and covers his tracks.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.519
Or that's where he delivered
the weapons.

09:39.543 --> 09:43.988
They take his sail bag, he takes theirs,
return to base. Repeat step one.

09:44.012 --> 09:47.075
Six times. Which is probably
why Renko got nowhere.

09:47.099 --> 09:48.904
You hearing this, Kensi?

09:48.928 --> 09:51.784
Yeah. I'm staring at Riley's rig
right now.

09:51.808 --> 09:54.329
- Parked outside his apartment.
- What about Riley?

09:54.353 --> 09:56.019
I haven't seen him yet.

09:56.402 --> 09:58.335
You know what?
I'm gonna go have a sniff around,

09:58.359 --> 10:01.198
see if he's been moving explosives.

10:52.375 --> 10:53.845
Bad idea, private.

10:53.869 --> 10:56.225
- You started without me.
- Oh, my God.

10:56.249 --> 10:58.270
You wandered off to observe
the scenery.

10:58.294 --> 11:00.267
I was checking Riley's mail box.

11:00.291 --> 11:02.459
What? No thanks
for saving your ass?

11:03.094 --> 11:04.647
My ass didn't need saving.

11:04.671 --> 11:06.719
- Sure it didn't.
- I'm sure it didn't.

11:07.264 --> 11:08.403
Give me this.

11:08.427 --> 11:10.841
Well, if anyone's ass deserves saving,
it's yours.

11:12.686 --> 11:14.821
I thought you were stealing my sail.

11:14.845 --> 11:18.035
So you garrotte me?
You whack my head into a car?

11:18.059 --> 11:19.728
It's a tough neighbourhood.

11:20.069 --> 11:23.081
You could have had a friend
or a gun.

11:23.105 --> 11:25.249
It turns out you had both.

11:25.273 --> 11:28.865
Why don't you just tell me about
your involvement with ELE?

11:29.954 --> 11:31.614
Who?

11:36.585 --> 11:39.255
The guys you sold the Dragons to?

11:41.424 --> 11:44.899
Should she be alone in there with him?
I mean, he's huge.

11:44.923 --> 11:48.794
Riley's bigger and stronger,
but she's meaner.

11:50.057 --> 11:52.655
We searched his apartment.
There's nothing of value there.

11:52.679 --> 11:56.327
Eric and Dom combed through
his bank accounts, his credit cards.

11:56.351 --> 12:00.330
If this guy was getting paid,
he's had some serious self-control.

12:00.354 --> 12:04.120
Okay, Riley manages to get a Dragon
off a secure base

12:04.144 --> 12:07.334
on six different occasions.
That's smart.

12:07.358 --> 12:09.502
But when your guy
Mackaye follows him,

12:09.526 --> 12:11.908
Riley kills him on Fishcam?

12:12.121 --> 12:15.620
- Not so smart.
- Yeah, it's impulsive, desperate.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.835
I don't know. I just get the feeling
the game's changed.

12:19.295 --> 12:23.268
He's lying, he's stonewalling,
and he is messing with me.

12:23.292 --> 12:25.257
Sounds like you on a second date.

12:26.135 --> 12:28.044
Nothing you'll ever have
to worry about.

12:29.638 --> 12:33.339
He even used a different cord
for his creepy garrotte m.o.

12:34.602 --> 12:36.475
There is one thing I'm sure of.

12:36.854 --> 12:40.578
He stole the missiles
and he killed Mackaye.

12:40.602 --> 12:43.372
And this guy's part Tim McVeigh,
part 9/11 bomber.

12:43.396 --> 12:45.336
He will never betray his cause.

12:45.360 --> 12:49.278
- Freeing America?
- But he's a follower, not a leader.

12:49.617 --> 12:51.609
I think he's afraid of something.

12:51.952 --> 12:53.826
Or someone.

13:09.470 --> 13:10.964
Get out.

13:16.811 --> 13:19.765
- Private Riley?
- Thank you.

13:26.028 --> 13:27.356
He's all yours, boys.

13:34.662 --> 13:38.873
See you tomorrow, Scott.
We'll be talking some more.

13:46.257 --> 13:47.502
What are you looking at?

14:11.072 --> 14:12.875
It's a nice cattle car.

14:12.899 --> 14:16.158
But you couldn't afford upholstery
for the whole thing? Is that it?

14:20.206 --> 14:21.974
I've been in a cell for three days,
okay?

14:21.998 --> 14:24.634
I want a shower, a shave,
and a clean uniform.

14:24.658 --> 14:27.848
- You shouldn't have dishonoured it.
- I have rights, you know.

14:27.872 --> 14:31.227
You signed those away.
Uncle Sam owns you.

14:31.251 --> 14:33.809
You messed with him.
I hope it was worth it, corporal.

14:33.833 --> 14:35.755
"Hope it was worth it."

14:36.347 --> 14:37.545
That's a nice guy.

14:40.143 --> 14:44.033
Check out that MP outfit. You think
he made those chevrons in shop class?

14:44.057 --> 14:46.199
Why don't you leave me out of it?

14:46.223 --> 14:47.750
Gee, look at you guys.

14:47.774 --> 14:50.231
Get you two a room together, huh?

14:51.070 --> 14:55.483
Hey, how many MPs does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

14:57.952 --> 14:59.387
Fifty.

14:59.411 --> 15:02.342
One to screw in the light bulb,
49 to stand guard.

15:02.366 --> 15:04.308
That is the worst joke
I've ever heard.

15:04.332 --> 15:06.802
No kidding. What is Callen doing?

15:06.826 --> 15:11.273
Psych 101. Forging a bond with Riley
by creating a common enemy in Sam.

15:11.297 --> 15:12.521
- You want another?
- No.

15:12.545 --> 15:13.724
No.

15:13.748 --> 15:16.820
Why don't MPs take showers
before they go to battle?

15:16.844 --> 15:20.512
They're just gonna wash up
on the shore anyways.

15:21.267 --> 15:22.465
You got a little smile.

15:23.853 --> 15:26.427
I got a little smile there.
How you doing?

15:31.361 --> 15:32.368
This is Eric.

15:32.392 --> 15:34.777
It's good to hear
you still know who you are.

15:34.989 --> 15:37.587
Ah. Hetty. You having a good time
in Washington?

15:37.611 --> 15:42.220
The last person to have a good time in
Washington was General Jubal Early.

15:42.244 --> 15:46.577
In 1864.
He was attacking it at the time.

15:46.960 --> 15:50.518
So the patients haven't burned down
the asylum yet?

15:50.542 --> 15:52.018
So far, so good.

15:52.042 --> 15:55.085
- And how's Mr. Callen doing?
- He is operational.

15:55.802 --> 15:57.023
Operational?

15:57.047 --> 15:59.972
Yeah. Renko's operation against
the militia? We had a breakthrough.

16:01.266 --> 16:03.649
What kind of a breakthrough, Eric?

16:03.673 --> 16:05.619
These guys won't talk
on a cell phone,

16:05.643 --> 16:09.809
but Riley used his laptop to
search porn, fringe propaganda sites,

16:10.942 --> 16:14.227
and 247 addresses
on Google Maps.

16:15.446 --> 16:19.111
This is
a crackpot, cockamamie operation.

16:19.659 --> 16:23.491
I leave for a few hours
and you all turn into lunatics.

16:23.830 --> 16:26.131
These militia groups
are far more paranoid

16:26.155 --> 16:28.348
than you could possibly appreciate.

16:28.372 --> 16:30.500
Now this is what I want you to do.

16:31.754 --> 16:33.355
If you'd like to make a call,

16:33.379 --> 16:34.852
please hang up and try again.

16:34.876 --> 16:37.006
It wasn't me.

16:37.969 --> 16:43.473
Ugh. Good Lord. Good Lord.
Damn. Damn.

16:46.728 --> 16:48.992
- Don't answer it.
- Hetty, Hetty, it's Nate.

16:49.016 --> 16:51.490
We did a full risk analysis
in every component

16:51.514 --> 16:54.336
and we ran it by Director Vance
and he signed off.

16:54.360 --> 16:56.709
And why didn't you inform me?

16:56.733 --> 16:58.624
You were in a Senate hearing.

16:58.648 --> 17:02.713
Nate, you have no idea
what you're up against here.

17:02.737 --> 17:06.053
Your risk assessment is useless.

17:06.077 --> 17:08.761
The dangers are unquantifiable.

17:08.785 --> 17:13.845
Mr. Callen could be killed or worse.

17:13.868 --> 17:16.430
Ms. Lange?
The committee is ready for you.

17:16.454 --> 17:19.608
Shut it down, Nate.

17:19.633 --> 17:22.009
Hetty, it's too late.

17:26.726 --> 17:28.635
Miss Lange.

17:31.064 --> 17:33.685
I have something here.

17:34.233 --> 17:38.361
Riley's hits on Google Maps?
All 247 of them are federal buildings.

17:39.238 --> 17:41.908
They're immigration processing
centres.

17:43.284 --> 17:45.905
I think we might have a list
of potential targets.

17:46.913 --> 17:48.383
Do you work out every day?

17:48.407 --> 17:51.178
You probably have time for that,
being an MP.

17:51.202 --> 17:53.640
Work out, play dress-up.

17:53.664 --> 17:57.040
Chasing guys like me around
instead of America's true enemies.

17:58.174 --> 18:01.923
I'm a true patriot.
I'm proud of my country.

18:02.679 --> 18:04.671
It's just the government that sucks.

18:21.364 --> 18:22.988
What the hell? Someone's shooting.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.135
- What the hell took you so long?
- I got here, okay?

18:35.159 --> 18:37.210
Get the keys. Give me the gun.

18:39.006 --> 18:41.308
- What's going on?
- It's not your problem, buddy.

18:41.332 --> 18:43.585
- Who are these guys?
- Not your problem. Come on.

18:54.480 --> 18:56.663
- Wait.
- Goddamn it.

18:56.687 --> 18:58.791
- Wait.
- Idiots.

18:58.815 --> 19:00.953
Hey, man, what about me?
You can't leave me here.

19:00.977 --> 19:03.206
- "Leave me out of it." Remember?
- Unlock me.

19:03.230 --> 19:05.624
I can help us. I got friends.

19:05.648 --> 19:08.968
- You know, we all got friends, buddy.
- Listen to me. This guy is connected.

19:08.992 --> 19:11.095
He's got people all over the country.

19:11.119 --> 19:13.423
He can help us.
He's got weapons. He's got food.

19:13.447 --> 19:17.159
Safe places to stay, you know?
They will never find us.

19:20.631 --> 19:23.015
Riley's taking the bait.
Callen has done in two hours

19:23.039 --> 19:25.731
what easily could have taken two years
to accomplish.

19:25.755 --> 19:28.419
Infiltrate a paranoid extremist group.

19:49.535 --> 19:52.406
- The party's over, boys.
- Nice job, fellas.

19:52.914 --> 19:53.914
Up.

19:54.707 --> 19:56.118
Clear this out of here.

19:56.501 --> 19:59.098
- You got the GPS locator?
- Yep. Signal's strong and clear.

19:59.122 --> 20:00.682
- Change of clothes?
- In the back.

20:00.706 --> 20:03.205
- Come on, come on. Let's go.
- Good, good.

20:04.550 --> 20:05.550
Yo.

20:42.412 --> 20:44.427
Please tell me
we're not going camping.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.591
- Are we camping?
- No, we're not camping.

20:46.615 --> 20:47.989
Because I hate camping.

20:51.963 --> 20:55.795
Hold your fire, Jay! It's Riley.

20:56.092 --> 20:58.820
- Give me the pistol.
- I don't think so.

20:58.844 --> 21:02.381
And the man we are going to see does
not take kindly to strangers with guns.

21:11.191 --> 21:13.159
You've gotta be kidding me.

21:13.183 --> 21:15.328
I'm being shot at by a Jonas brother.

21:15.352 --> 21:18.399
And I think I'm about to meet
the rest of the family.

21:21.242 --> 21:23.650
Point that thing at me again
and I will break your neck.

21:26.122 --> 21:28.850
- Take me to Malcolm.
- He hates strangers.

21:28.874 --> 21:30.322
Fine. It's your funeral.

21:32.045 --> 21:34.227
It's Jay. I'm coming back.
There's company.

21:34.251 --> 21:36.415
Is there gonna be bathroom
where we're going?

21:37.133 --> 21:38.936
- You can go in the woods.
- I knew it.

21:38.960 --> 21:41.733
I save your life,
you take me camping.

21:41.757 --> 21:44.444
At least where I come from,
they got toilets.

21:44.468 --> 21:46.194
And TV and fun.

21:46.218 --> 21:49.477
At least where I come from,
we know how to shut our mouth.

21:52.107 --> 21:54.064
At least I don't have
an Appalachian goatee.

21:56.069 --> 21:58.145
At least I can grow one.

22:08.915 --> 22:11.845
Nate, you got a minute?
I think you need to hear this.

22:11.869 --> 22:15.305
Ten years ago, Hetty worked
with an agent named Sullivan.

22:15.329 --> 22:17.770
He was killed
infiltrating a militia group.

22:17.794 --> 22:21.062
- Well, that explains her reaction.
- Yeah, but there's something else.

22:21.086 --> 22:25.234
She personally recruited him
to NCIS.

22:25.258 --> 22:29.951
She was an operations manager
on the joint task force with Miami P.D.

22:29.975 --> 22:33.181
She wrote his recommendation letter
to get him the job.

22:33.481 --> 22:36.850
Said that he was the best young
detective that she'd ever seen.

22:38.570 --> 22:40.206
"Composed, confidant,

22:40.230 --> 22:43.192
and mentally suited to the rigours
of undercover work."

22:43.783 --> 22:44.981
Remind you of anyone?

22:46.244 --> 22:47.703
Yeah.

22:48.830 --> 22:50.549
I'm sorry, this is a private meeting.

22:50.573 --> 22:51.863
Jack, it's okay.

22:52.917 --> 22:55.645
Why on God's green earth
did you not tell me, Leon?

22:55.669 --> 22:58.375
Excuse me, senators.

22:59.966 --> 23:02.777
There are very few ways to infiltrate
a militia. You have to jump at...

23:02.801 --> 23:04.819
The reason you can't get in

23:04.843 --> 23:07.065
is they're crazy and paranoid
and dangerous.

23:07.089 --> 23:10.100
Hetty, Callen is not Sullivan.

23:10.810 --> 23:13.408
Now we deal with terrorists, cartels,
and gangs every day.

23:13.432 --> 23:15.763
There's no reason to think
this will be any different.

23:16.399 --> 23:17.573
- Jack?
- Yes, sir.

23:17.597 --> 23:20.456
Will you please escort Miss Lange
so she can finish her testimony?

23:20.480 --> 23:22.289
Right this way, ma'am.

23:22.313 --> 23:26.297
I'll take care of it, Hetty. I promise.

23:26.321 --> 23:29.862
Some promises you can't keep,
Leon.

23:37.712 --> 23:40.168
There's been a lot of traffic
through here, guys.

23:40.632 --> 23:43.229
I'm thinking, about at least
five different vehicles,

23:43.253 --> 23:45.335
maybe one heavy truck.

23:50.099 --> 23:52.282
I found Callen's earwig.

23:52.306 --> 23:54.113
G's worried
he's gonna get searched.

23:54.137 --> 23:56.933
I guess the paranoia is contagious.

24:14.707 --> 24:16.783
Okay, here we go.

24:35.937 --> 24:37.561
That's one of the Dragons.

24:41.568 --> 24:43.832
That's Malcolm Tallridge,
the founder of ELE.

24:43.856 --> 24:47.232
Nasty guy next to him
is John Bordinay, his right-hand man.

24:49.033 --> 24:51.026
Malcolm, Bordinay.

24:51.494 --> 24:52.929
Riley, who's your friend?

24:52.953 --> 24:55.884
He was on the transport.
His buddies sprung us.

24:55.908 --> 24:57.624
- Where's the buddies?
- Dead.

24:59.627 --> 25:01.145
I think we just hit
the mother lode.

25:01.169 --> 25:04.374
All five of the missiles
are right in that cabin.

25:06.301 --> 25:08.068
You killed a Marine,

25:08.092 --> 25:11.357
you got yourself caught,
and took out a transport?

25:11.381 --> 25:13.774
Then you brought an outsider here?

25:13.798 --> 25:15.529
How many ways
are you gonna expose us?

25:15.553 --> 25:17.197
It's safer this way.

25:17.221 --> 25:20.206
No one gets picked up.
No one answering questions.

25:20.230 --> 25:22.663
This is the entire militia organisation.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.955
Hey, Dom, we need backup now.

25:25.979 --> 25:27.316
Done.

25:28.281 --> 25:29.965
On their way.

25:29.989 --> 25:32.530
Callen will get out of there
first chance he gets, right?

25:32.994 --> 25:35.009
If he keeps his head down,
we're home free.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.485
Oh, yeah. Piece of cake.

25:38.833 --> 25:40.577
He's right.

25:46.716 --> 25:48.044
Don't fire unless you have to.

25:53.848 --> 25:56.066
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

25:56.090 --> 25:58.094
Don't shoot. Do not shoot.

25:58.770 --> 26:01.308
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

26:02.482 --> 26:04.356
What do we do now?

26:07.487 --> 26:09.693
I don't want trouble, Malcolm.

26:11.407 --> 26:13.709
You all seem like patriotic citizens.

26:13.733 --> 26:16.424
You know how to hold up
your end of a deal, am I right?

26:16.448 --> 26:19.717
- Who's in the woods, son?
- You tell me.

26:19.741 --> 26:22.465
I just want the keys to that truck
and I'm gone.

26:22.489 --> 26:23.914
No one gets hurt.

26:24.754 --> 26:26.379
Don't worry.
They're not gonna shoot us.

26:27.715 --> 26:28.747
I'm not sure about that.

26:33.179 --> 26:35.302
Call them off, Malcolm.

26:35.682 --> 26:37.306
Go ahead. Shoot the kid.

26:37.976 --> 26:39.968
He's willing to die for his cause.

26:41.020 --> 26:42.301
Is that what you want, Jay?

26:45.275 --> 26:47.647
He'd rather not, Malcolm.

26:48.194 --> 26:51.254
What do you say you and I have
a conversation? We talk about this.

26:51.278 --> 26:54.175
I need Director Vance on the phone.
Get him out if that meeting.

26:54.199 --> 26:56.549
We need that backup now.
I have an agent in distress.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.760
Dom's getting the ETA.
They're on their way.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.327
- Maybe Hetty was right.
- Hetty's always right.

27:02.834 --> 27:04.470
Jay is a kid.

27:04.494 --> 27:07.041
And you don't need
that kind of press.

27:07.547 --> 27:09.539
Not gonna be good
with your recruitment effort.

27:12.343 --> 27:13.506
What is Sam doing?

27:15.763 --> 27:17.720
Keep your cool.

27:18.725 --> 27:20.195
I'm not armed.

27:20.219 --> 27:24.011
I'm with the ATF.
We have the camp surrounded.

27:24.689 --> 27:26.954
I'm authorised to negotiate
a settlement.

27:26.978 --> 27:29.249
We don't want another Ruby Ridge.

27:29.273 --> 27:32.753
We know about the Dragons.
We know about Mackaye.

27:32.777 --> 27:36.209
We've had agents watching you
for three weeks. I'm here to talk.

27:36.233 --> 27:38.378
What on earth is he doing?

27:38.402 --> 27:41.223
- The other guy's an agent?
- Yeah. Agent Callen.

27:41.247 --> 27:43.548
Everybody's standing down.
No one's coming in.

27:43.572 --> 27:45.576
You and I have 30 minutes
to make a deal.

27:49.130 --> 27:51.099
Hope backup gets here fast.

27:51.123 --> 27:53.090
Eyes open.

27:55.094 --> 27:57.941
- It sounds like you have us in a bind.
- It's textbook negotiation.

27:57.965 --> 28:00.784
He's giving the illusion
he has a bargaining chip.

28:00.808 --> 28:02.173
But he doesn't.

28:03.728 --> 28:05.328
Let's see how good you are.

28:05.352 --> 28:07.680
Go get your friend then we'll talk.

28:09.609 --> 28:10.854
Let him through.

28:16.532 --> 28:18.442
G, I'm coming to you.

28:20.203 --> 28:22.586
I hope you have a better plan
than this.

28:22.610 --> 28:24.781
Move those bodies.

28:35.343 --> 28:38.095
Okay, everything's good.

28:40.765 --> 28:43.314
- Now what?
- You think the ATF is gonna come in,

28:43.338 --> 28:45.843
guns blazing,
when there's hostages involved?

28:46.229 --> 28:48.186
Guess you'll have to wait 30 minutes
to see.

28:50.358 --> 28:52.350
Jay, come here.

28:55.822 --> 28:57.102
Come here.

29:02.078 --> 29:03.429
Hey, come on, man.

29:03.453 --> 29:05.780
- You didn't need to do that.
- G.

29:33.466 --> 29:34.473
How long was I out?

29:34.497 --> 29:37.606
A few minutes.
I've been kicking you the whole time.

29:37.630 --> 29:39.464
In the side of the head?

29:42.809 --> 29:43.983
Why aren't we dead?

29:44.007 --> 29:46.652
They wanna find out
if they're surrounded by 50 agents.

29:46.676 --> 29:48.241
How long is that gonna take?

29:48.265 --> 29:50.325
The time it takes to pack up,
bust out of here,

29:50.349 --> 29:52.043
and realise
no one's shooting at them.

29:52.067 --> 29:54.417
They do that before or after
they kill us?

29:54.441 --> 29:56.522
After. Definitely after.

29:56.823 --> 29:58.423
You wanna explain yourself?

29:58.447 --> 30:01.379
Explain myself?
I saved your skinny ass.

30:01.403 --> 30:04.389
Let's see. I had a gun and a hostage
before you got here.

30:04.413 --> 30:08.804
Now I'm chained up to a stove
with a concussion.

30:08.828 --> 30:10.092
That's a nice save.

30:10.116 --> 30:13.355
Ten more seconds, you'd have a dozen
new bullet holes in you.

30:13.379 --> 30:16.727
- Now what?
- I was hoping you had some ideas.

30:16.751 --> 30:19.797
I'm thinking I want my gun
and my hostage back.

30:20.388 --> 30:22.096
Excuse me.

30:23.975 --> 30:25.884
Sorry to pull you out.

30:26.519 --> 30:28.346
How bad?

30:28.980 --> 30:31.957
They have Callen and Sam.

30:31.981 --> 30:34.439
Backup is en route.

30:36.738 --> 30:38.446
And that's it?

30:38.823 --> 30:42.026
The L.A. Field office has done
everything they can.

30:42.285 --> 30:44.527
There's nothing more
you can do here.

30:45.163 --> 30:47.535
We should know more soon.

30:50.210 --> 30:51.596
Choppers are 23 minutes out.

30:51.620 --> 30:54.308
This is gonna be over in ten.
They're packing up the missiles.

30:54.332 --> 30:56.106
We gotta buy them some time then.

30:56.130 --> 30:59.027
- You got any ideas?
- Drive another car into the camp?

30:59.051 --> 31:00.927
Think that's gonna work again?

31:01.513 --> 31:02.888
Take a look at this.

31:09.521 --> 31:11.015
How's your Morse code?

31:14.442 --> 31:16.150
That was the last one.

31:25.411 --> 31:27.427
Oh, this just keeps getting better.

31:27.451 --> 31:31.133
Is it flickering?
It feels like it's flickering.

31:31.157 --> 31:33.907
That's because it's Morse code.

31:34.796 --> 31:36.100
- Got it.
- What?

31:36.124 --> 31:37.602
A bobby pin.

31:37.626 --> 31:40.182
I started wearing it in the '90s.
Haven't used it since.

31:40.206 --> 31:44.133
That's the most well-trained display of
standard procedure I've seen from you.

31:44.681 --> 31:46.115
Oh, no.

31:46.139 --> 31:48.027
- What?
- I dropped it.

31:48.051 --> 31:51.393
- You dropped it? How could you?
- It kind of sprung.

31:51.854 --> 31:53.681
Oh, I got it. I'm good.

31:54.232 --> 31:56.390
- Just keep reading the code.
- Keep your head still.

31:57.277 --> 31:59.186
It's still. Am I good?

32:02.198 --> 32:04.820
Kensi says the choppers
are 20 minutes out.

32:05.577 --> 32:08.114
How do you know it was Kensi
not Renko?

32:08.913 --> 32:10.538
Kensi versus Renko?

32:11.249 --> 32:13.467
Who remembers their Morse code?

32:13.491 --> 32:14.996
Can you send it back?

32:15.461 --> 32:17.560
Shh. Yeah, I can send it back.

32:17.584 --> 32:20.626
It's called training
and paying attention.

32:21.509 --> 32:22.979
Thought you said
I was well-prepared.

32:23.003 --> 32:25.336
It must have been
Stockholm syndrome.

32:36.107 --> 32:37.281
Maskelyne?

32:37.305 --> 32:40.663
- What the hell is Maskelyne?
- Maskelyne? I don't know.

32:40.687 --> 32:44.278
- Maybe it's a code word.
- Incoming. It's Hetty.

32:44.616 --> 32:48.007
- Hetty, it's all of us. Please don't yell.
- I'm not yelling.

32:48.031 --> 32:49.507
What don't I know?

32:49.531 --> 32:52.242
Backup will be there in 18 minutes.

32:52.749 --> 32:55.726
Hetty, we don't think
they can last that long.

32:55.750 --> 32:58.646
Nate got a message from Kensi
from Callen in Morse code

32:58.670 --> 33:01.874
about something called Maskelyne.

33:02.967 --> 33:07.819
Maskelyne.
It's not a thing, it's a who.

33:07.843 --> 33:11.655
He was a magician in World War II.

33:11.679 --> 33:13.867
He invented subterfuge.

33:13.891 --> 33:19.079
He could make an entire squadron
of tanks disappear.

33:19.103 --> 33:21.208
He tricked the Nazis into believing

33:21.232 --> 33:24.463
that a handful of men
was an entire division.

33:24.487 --> 33:27.039
- Smoke and mirrors.
- Now listen.

33:27.063 --> 33:30.337
These militia groups, they already
believe they are being pursued

33:30.361 --> 33:33.348
by the full force
of the United States government.

33:33.372 --> 33:36.375
- So we play to those fears.
- Exactly.

33:42.131 --> 33:44.349
I've jammed all the radio signals
in the area.

33:44.373 --> 33:46.934
They'll start futzing with the dials
to find a frequency

33:46.958 --> 33:48.571
and hopefully stumble upon us.

33:48.595 --> 33:50.815
The idea is to make them think
they're surrounded.

33:50.839 --> 33:53.471
- One becomes ten.
- Yeah.

33:53.851 --> 33:56.224
Mr. Secretary.

33:56.479 --> 33:59.871
Henrietta. What can I do for you?

33:59.895 --> 34:02.414
Desmond, I need a favour.

34:02.438 --> 34:04.650
A small one.

34:05.071 --> 34:07.253
- All teams in place.
- Teams 1, 2, 3,

34:07.277 --> 34:10.674
taking positions north, northwest
and southwest.

34:10.697 --> 34:12.967
Teams 4, 5, snipers in position.

34:12.991 --> 34:15.926
Sniper 1, target identified.
Sniper 2, target in sight.

34:15.949 --> 34:17.891
Roger, Sniper 3. Target identified.

34:17.915 --> 34:19.554
Militia leader. Permission to engage?

34:19.578 --> 34:22.054
- Malcolm, are you hearing this?
- Yeah.

34:22.078 --> 34:23.417
Kensi, go.

34:25.507 --> 34:27.132
We got shots fired. Shots fired.

34:43.693 --> 34:44.996
You think we can make a run for it?

34:45.021 --> 34:46.391
No.

34:46.779 --> 34:48.108
Wanna try it anyways?

34:49.032 --> 34:50.146
Drop it.

34:52.368 --> 34:55.130
- Not gonna go through this again?
- Nice face.

34:55.155 --> 34:57.298
They're not very nice to you out there.

34:57.322 --> 34:59.348
At least I'm not a complete liar.

34:59.372 --> 35:02.460
Well, at least I'm not running around
with a bunch of wannabe Rambos.

35:03.004 --> 35:05.471
Now you ought to be with your friends
playing Guitar Hero

35:05.495 --> 35:07.227
or down at the beach
picking up chicks.

35:07.251 --> 35:10.046
Not camping out with a bunch of
The Hills Have Eyes psychos.

35:10.386 --> 35:14.384
What do you think the missiles
are for? Self defence?

35:14.599 --> 35:17.719
There comes a time when you gotta
choose which side you're on.

35:30.114 --> 35:31.941
Malcolm.

35:32.825 --> 35:33.916
There's 20 agents.

35:33.940 --> 35:37.012
They're on the access road.
They are coming for us.

35:37.036 --> 35:40.621
You're sure about that, huh?
You sure you didn't just imagine it?

35:40.958 --> 35:44.624
They're coming. I swear.
We need to get out of here.

36:20.623 --> 36:22.165
Looks like they bought it.

36:57.034 --> 36:58.529
- He's not gonna stop.
- No, no.

36:58.870 --> 37:00.447
- He'll stop.
- No, he's not.

37:02.665 --> 37:04.159
You're right. He's not.

37:36.115 --> 37:38.357
- All right, Agent Callen.
- I appreciate it.

37:51.088 --> 37:54.433
I spoke with the special agent
in charge

37:54.457 --> 37:56.898
and he spoke with the U.S. Attorney.

37:56.922 --> 38:00.095
They said you could go home
for now.

38:01.766 --> 38:03.260
Do you have anywhere you can go?

38:05.895 --> 38:07.971
Can I call my mom?

38:13.194 --> 38:14.820
626-555-0110.

38:20.910 --> 38:22.986
At least I know how to dial
a cell phone.

38:25.665 --> 38:27.574
At least I'm not going to jail.

38:29.877 --> 38:32.547
At least
I didn't accidentally join a militia.

38:34.924 --> 38:39.004
At least I finally woke up
and saved your behind.

38:40.847 --> 38:42.389
Yeah.

38:45.768 --> 38:47.393
At least you were on my side.

38:57.321 --> 38:59.148
Hi, Mom.

38:59.866 --> 39:02.048
Oh, honey. Baby, where are you?

39:02.072 --> 39:03.654
Where have you been?

39:04.287 --> 39:06.967
F-22s, nice touch.

39:06.991 --> 39:11.933
Whatever funding I procured today,
we just blew on an air show.

39:11.957 --> 39:14.535
Yeah, there goes my slush fund.

39:17.049 --> 39:18.983
You knew.

39:19.007 --> 39:22.628
- You knew that I would go...
- I had a suspicion.

39:24.056 --> 39:27.733
You baited me.

39:27.757 --> 39:30.533
You pulled me out of that hearing

39:30.557 --> 39:35.522
and you baited me to go to the SECAF
so you wouldn't have to.

39:35.860 --> 39:37.745
I didn't think he'd do it for me.

39:37.769 --> 39:42.299
And that way,
I could spend my political capital

39:42.323 --> 39:47.070
so that you wouldn't have
to spend yours, Leon.

39:54.545 --> 39:56.668
Sullivan was a good agent.

39:57.465 --> 39:59.707
He would have become a great one.

40:00.468 --> 40:01.547
Like Callen.

40:04.680 --> 40:07.467
I'd never lost an agent
before Sullivan.

40:08.142 --> 40:10.715
But you saved two today.

40:11.312 --> 40:13.055
You should feel good.

40:27.703 --> 40:30.882
You know, that was really stupid,
coming in to get me.

40:30.906 --> 40:32.516
You're calling me stupid?

40:32.540 --> 40:35.519
You wanted to Butch Cassidy me.
You wanted to run for it.

40:35.543 --> 40:38.333
It wasn't my best idea.

40:38.673 --> 40:40.974
You wanted
to Custer's Last Stand me.

40:40.998 --> 40:43.583
You wanted to Alamo me.

40:45.471 --> 40:47.855
You gonna put that
in your little report?

40:47.879 --> 40:49.611
With colour-coded tabs?

40:49.635 --> 40:51.160
Yeah.

40:51.184 --> 40:54.021
Tabs marked "dumb-ass idea."

40:54.981 --> 40:59.358
Nice job, Special Agent Hanna.

41:00.820 --> 41:05.814
Ah. You said it. You feel good?

41:06.784 --> 41:10.449
No. Cheapens the work.
