WEBVTT

00:05.011 --> 00:06.845
<i>We advance south on Spartacus</i>

00:06.913 --> 00:09.114
<i>and those who follow him in rebellion.</i>

00:09.182 --> 00:11.150
<i>Let our shadow fall upon them</i>

00:11.217 --> 00:12.851
and every man, woman and child

00:12.919 --> 00:15.721
so touched by it,
struck from this world.

00:16.423 --> 00:17.324
A bargain well struck.

00:17.391 --> 00:19.093
Call me Roman no more then.

00:19.160 --> 00:20.962
Those that join us are well armed.

00:21.029 --> 00:23.632
You move to take the fucking city.

00:26.770 --> 00:28.004
You wanted me father?

00:28.072 --> 00:30.206
Find Spartacus and send
word of his movement.

00:30.274 --> 00:32.009
But do not tempt engagement

00:32.077 --> 00:34.112
until I have arrived with proper force.

00:40.687 --> 00:42.622
<i>The Aedile bars himself in the horreum,</i>

00:42.689 --> 00:44.891
<i>spilling pitch and threatens</i>
<i>to put light to bear.</i>

00:45.826 --> 00:46.760
No!

00:46.828 --> 00:48.696
The city, is ours.

01:37.319 --> 01:40.154
Swords born from shackles.

01:40.221 --> 01:42.022
Your hands turn miracle, Attius.

01:42.090 --> 01:43.257
Then perhaps you would bless them

01:43.324 --> 01:45.993
with additional coin,
in reward for such divinity.

01:46.061 --> 01:47.061
Knowing effort serves higher

01:47.129 --> 01:48.129
purpose is reward enough.

01:49.498 --> 01:53.702
You chew on fresh bargain,
only to swallow stale shit.

01:53.769 --> 01:55.537
Suck cock,
you long-haired woman.

01:55.605 --> 01:56.972
Ahh!

01:58.041 --> 01:59.007
Aid Gannicus,

01:59.075 --> 02:01.710
in delivery of latest
offering to Crixus.

02:01.778 --> 02:03.846
Should you linger within our city,

02:03.914 --> 02:05.515
we shall discuss terms
of future benefit.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.254
I do not lay trust in that little shit.

02:13.723 --> 02:16.057
You do not lay trust in anyone.

02:16.125 --> 02:17.158
You come with me!

02:17.226 --> 02:19.794
More so when they carry name of Rome.

02:19.861 --> 02:21.095
Ah, go!
Silent cunt!

02:21.163 --> 02:22.229
Lugo.

02:25.533 --> 02:28.568
How fare our prisoners?

02:28.636 --> 02:30.837
They fucking shit themselves!

02:30.905 --> 02:33.507
A smell welcome to nose!

02:33.574 --> 02:34.908
See that they are fed.

02:37.245 --> 02:38.645
<i>These prisoners?</i>
<i>We take them where?</i>

02:38.647 --> 02:39.814
I question thought of keeping them

02:39.882 --> 02:41.649
shackled throughout fucking streets.

02:41.717 --> 02:43.821
Is that all you question?

02:43.889 --> 02:45.689
We are at war, Spartacus.

02:45.757 --> 02:48.125
I would see our enemy
struck to the afterlife.

02:48.192 --> 02:49.672
Women and children counted among them?

02:51.569 --> 02:52.809
Were the same not robbed of life

02:52.837 --> 02:54.939
in escape from Batiatus' villa?

02:55.007 --> 02:57.742
Or the taking of this very city?

02:57.810 --> 02:59.511
They were.

02:59.579 --> 03:01.413
<i>Yet few that remain pose</i>
<i>no fall to concern.</i>

03:01.480 --> 03:03.982
They pose concern to fucking stomach.

03:04.050 --> 03:05.150
Drawing from our food --

03:05.218 --> 03:07.119
which runs low from Aedile

03:07.187 --> 03:08.854
dousing pitch upon grain.

03:11.260 --> 03:12.928
Let us gauge our stores.

03:12.996 --> 03:15.097
And turn from thought
of needless slaughter.

03:20.304 --> 03:27.009
<i>Keep eye upon your opponent.</i>

03:27.077 --> 03:31.481
<i>Seek to turn defense into attack.</i>

03:31.548 --> 03:34.384
More steel, forged towards purpose.

03:40.524 --> 03:42.892
He has been paid
what Spartacus promised,

03:42.960 --> 03:44.194
for aiding taking the city?

03:44.261 --> 03:46.129
Five thousand denarii.

03:46.197 --> 03:47.164
Well earned.

03:47.231 --> 03:48.298
Then why does he yet darken

03:48.366 --> 03:49.867
presence within our walls?

03:51.503 --> 03:54.038
Give answer.
I'm not fucking echo.

03:54.106 --> 03:56.107
To further lend hand to your cause.

03:58.878 --> 04:00.646
The promise of gathering more coin

04:00.713 --> 04:03.749
before taking leave
also weighs consideration.

04:06.153 --> 04:08.487
Naevia!
Nasir!

04:11.825 --> 04:14.594
<i>See those of skill to proper weapon.</i>

04:23.870 --> 04:25.204
For your journey.

04:30.777 --> 04:33.711
I wake with desire for cock.

04:33.779 --> 04:35.513
Yet you from bed.

04:43.422 --> 04:45.289
Cause bring fucking shadow.

04:46.859 --> 04:49.961
The girl follows heel like errant pup,

04:50.029 --> 04:51.830
since I took her master's life.

05:03.242 --> 05:04.576
Clear a fucking path.

05:07.246 --> 05:08.913
<i>Keep moving!</i>

05:08.981 --> 05:09.914
<i>Against the wall!</i>

05:09.982 --> 05:11.049
<i>Sit here!</i>

05:11.117 --> 05:12.284
<i>And shut mouth!</i>

05:16.423 --> 05:18.090
Your wife is with child.

05:20.427 --> 05:22.295
She should not be absent nourishment.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.300
Gratitude.

05:30.605 --> 05:32.372
You mistake intent.

05:32.440 --> 05:35.275
I do not offer charity,

05:35.343 --> 05:37.411
I offer exchange.

05:39.415 --> 05:41.016
Bread,

05:41.084 --> 05:44.653
for whatever coin you
may know of yet undiscovered.

05:44.721 --> 05:47.289
Perhaps within walls
of your own little hovel?

05:52.896 --> 05:55.131
Two streets west of the horreum.

05:55.199 --> 05:57.900
The name Ulpianus the above door.

05:57.968 --> 06:02.672
Inside, leg of table stands hollow.

06:02.740 --> 06:05.441
You will find all that I have there.

06:05.509 --> 06:08.945
Any more offerings?

06:09.012 --> 06:10.647
No?

06:10.714 --> 06:12.549
Very well then.

06:12.616 --> 06:14.017
Wait.

06:14.085 --> 06:17.020
The bread.
For my wife...

06:17.088 --> 06:20.362
Ah. Apologies.

06:32.504 --> 06:35.006
<i>Who's more hungry?</i>

06:38.911 --> 06:42.781
Do you wish to see blood?

06:42.848 --> 06:46.051
<i>Someone will starve!</i>

06:46.118 --> 06:48.987
<i>You cunt!</i>

06:49.054 --> 06:50.722
Do you desire blood?

06:50.789 --> 06:52.924
Yeah!!
Yeah!

06:58.897 --> 07:00.765
Then let us have proper contest!

07:03.535 --> 07:05.136
Bring swords!

07:07.139 --> 07:08.072
I know that one.

07:08.140 --> 07:10.842
Ulpianus, a baker of breads.

07:13.212 --> 07:15.380
He is no fighter,
nor man of distant heart.

07:17.850 --> 07:20.219
We fall to fucking games now?

07:20.287 --> 07:21.888
The Romans forced
you and Crixus to such,

07:21.922 --> 07:24.090
for their amusement.

07:24.158 --> 07:26.159
We but return favor.

07:37.803 --> 07:39.270
I beg you...
I have no skill in this.

07:39.338 --> 07:41.305
<i>Oh, he has no skill in this.</i>

07:41.373 --> 07:43.073
<i>This is Roman cunt!</i>

07:43.141 --> 07:46.376
Let the victor, claim their bounty!

07:47.377 --> 07:49.345
<i>And the sea the fallen,</i>

07:49.412 --> 07:51.013
to join the Roman dead

07:51.080 --> 07:53.581
which we have swept from this city!

07:57.752 --> 07:58.818
No!

08:00.688 --> 08:02.221
Begin.

08:03.790 --> 08:05.657
<i>Go!</i>
<i>Begin!</i>

08:05.725 --> 08:08.592
<i>Get at him!</i>

08:08.660 --> 08:10.727
<i>Draw blood!</i>

08:16.967 --> 08:18.034
<i>Ulpianus!</i>

08:20.603 --> 08:21.803
<i>Ulpianus!</i>

08:44.057 --> 08:45.124
Come on!
Get at him!

09:07.815 --> 09:09.082
No, Ulpianus!

09:33.973 --> 09:36.408
A fight far from worthy arena.

09:38.144 --> 09:39.277
<i>But promise was made.</i>

09:39.345 --> 09:41.812
Yeah!

09:41.880 --> 09:43.414
Feast upon laurels.

09:52.825 --> 09:54.992
You fucking shit...

10:04.569 --> 10:05.569
He reached for sword to strike

10:05.637 --> 10:06.771
when you presented back!

10:07.008 --> 10:10.177
He was reaching for the food,
you mad cunt!

10:12.247 --> 10:13.514
Hold tongue,

10:13.582 --> 10:14.949
or see it ripped from fucking head.

10:15.016 --> 10:17.618
Take pause, brother.

10:17.686 --> 10:19.454
Attius stands with us.

10:23.192 --> 10:25.159
He stands a fucking Roman.

10:33.802 --> 10:35.436
The man has never raised voice in anger,

10:35.504 --> 10:38.439
to slave, or any other.

10:38.507 --> 10:39.474
How do your friends differ,

10:39.541 --> 10:41.642
from the fucking villain they brand me?

10:43.446 --> 10:44.713
Was he reaching for the bread?

10:44.780 --> 10:46.782
I did not think it.

10:46.849 --> 10:48.483
And what if you were mistaken?

10:51.120 --> 10:53.488
The result the same.

10:53.556 --> 10:56.959
A Roman that shall
never raise hand against us.

10:57.026 --> 11:00.963
I have never held love
for any of such name,

11:01.031 --> 11:02.131
Yet he held no threat --

11:02.198 --> 11:05.801
Men such as him hold the greatest.

11:05.869 --> 11:07.970
True intent, shrouded behind mask

11:08.037 --> 11:09.972
of kind and gentle face.

11:11.274 --> 11:12.741
Have you known his reflection?

11:17.714 --> 11:20.182
Before I came to the mines of Lucania.

11:23.020 --> 11:26.989
This one carried gentle name of Herius.

11:29.259 --> 11:30.460
Husband.

11:30.527 --> 11:31.928
Father of two young daughters.

11:31.995 --> 11:33.429
He saw me fed.

11:33.497 --> 11:34.697
Bathed.

11:34.765 --> 11:35.898
Allowed me to feel safe

11:35.966 --> 11:37.300
for the first time since being turned

11:37.367 --> 11:41.004
from the House of Batiatus.

11:41.071 --> 11:43.439
When his family took to sleep,
he came to me.

11:45.576 --> 11:48.178
Lifting me in his arms.

11:52.851 --> 11:55.954
I thought it a dream at first.

11:56.021 --> 11:59.758
There was a place,

11:59.826 --> 12:04.296
removed from the grounds of his villa,

12:04.364 --> 12:07.667
where wagons were crafted and repaired.

12:12.272 --> 12:16.075
He applied his many tools inside me.

12:19.613 --> 12:21.781
Before turning them to outward flesh.

12:27.854 --> 12:31.122
I wish I had power to seize memory,

12:31.190 --> 12:35.827
and with hands strip it from life.

12:35.895 --> 12:38.831
It is not the one that shadows mind.

12:38.898 --> 12:42.602
What I saw in morning light,

12:42.670 --> 12:44.737
forever darkens thought.

12:44.805 --> 12:47.540
The man himself,

12:47.608 --> 12:53.613
greeting his wife with
kiss and warm smile.

12:53.681 --> 12:58.652
His daughters laughing upon his knee.

12:58.719 --> 13:02.856
The beast from
the previous night transformed,

13:06.527 --> 13:09.429
into a man who held no threat.

13:11.966 --> 13:13.566
I have no words.

13:13.634 --> 13:18.304
You do not need them.

13:18.372 --> 13:20.439
Knowing, you are at my side

13:20.507 --> 13:22.308
gives comfort enough.

13:22.376 --> 13:24.276
I will always stand so.

13:34.454 --> 13:37.590
All the fucking stalls
bear same misfortune.

13:37.658 --> 13:39.558
And of the remainder?

13:39.626 --> 13:40.826
How long will it see us fed?

13:40.894 --> 13:42.027
Two weeks.

13:42.095 --> 13:43.128
Perhaps more, if we're cautious

13:43.196 --> 13:45.030
and our numbers do not swell.

13:45.097 --> 13:47.933
Fuck the gods.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.901
Spartacus.

13:49.969 --> 13:51.403
Ships weigh anchor off our coast.

13:58.512 --> 14:01.915
It seems we have drawn notice.

14:01.983 --> 14:03.850
Sanus.

14:03.918 --> 14:05.352
What do your eyes fall upon?

14:05.419 --> 14:07.788
Four men approach.
Armed.

14:07.856 --> 14:10.057
One with cask perched atop shoulder.

14:10.124 --> 14:11.091
Romans?

14:11.159 --> 14:13.660
Not fucking likely, by appearance.

14:16.230 --> 14:17.564
Raise the gate.

14:31.045 --> 14:33.680
What shit is this?

14:33.748 --> 14:35.748
Brigands of Cilicia.

14:35.816 --> 14:37.283
Pirates?

14:39.219 --> 14:40.886
I would speak with the man

14:40.954 --> 14:42.755
that has claimed this city.

14:46.192 --> 14:48.793
Your words fall upon his ear.

14:50.897 --> 14:53.332
What business do you break?

14:53.399 --> 14:56.101
You are Spartacus?

14:56.169 --> 14:58.704
I stand so named.

14:58.771 --> 14:59.905
The same fiend that brought down

14:59.972 --> 15:01.807
the arena in Capua?

15:01.874 --> 15:05.043
Defeated Glaber at Vesuvius?

15:05.111 --> 15:07.679
Wrought untold suffering

15:07.747 --> 15:10.215
upon the Republic and its people.

15:10.283 --> 15:13.051
All deeds claimed with pride.

15:21.227 --> 15:23.661
Then I call you fucking brother!

15:28.901 --> 15:31.770
Let us share gift of wine,

15:31.837 --> 15:34.873
and break words towards common enemy!

15:52.425 --> 15:53.692
Gaius!

15:53.760 --> 15:55.527
It has been too many years.

15:55.595 --> 15:57.363
They have been
unkind to you, old friend.

15:58.498 --> 16:01.267
At least I do not
stand woolly fucking goat!

16:01.334 --> 16:03.702
Crassus denies me sharpened blade.

16:03.770 --> 16:05.337
Under what purpose?

16:05.404 --> 16:07.339
A personal matter,

16:07.407 --> 16:10.075
concerning only those
within his confidence.

16:10.143 --> 16:13.145
Regrettably none stand so here.

16:13.213 --> 16:14.247
You have received message

16:14.314 --> 16:16.749
in advance of our arrival, Mummius?

16:16.817 --> 16:19.419
We stand ready to march
upon your command.

16:19.487 --> 16:22.356
<i>Have use of my tent until such a time.</i>

16:22.423 --> 16:23.457
Come!

16:23.525 --> 16:25.759
I would leave these boys
to their plotting

16:25.827 --> 16:28.862
and hear of your
adventures with Antonius.

16:31.566 --> 16:32.800
Impudent shit.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.235
He brushes you aside in favor

16:34.302 --> 16:36.971
of swallowing Caesar's cock.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.139
Let us pray he chokes upon it.

16:41.676 --> 16:42.576
Adherbal!

16:42.644 --> 16:44.478
Break open cask so we may share drink.

16:44.546 --> 16:46.080
I would break words in advance.

16:46.148 --> 16:48.049
While mind is yet unclouded.

16:48.116 --> 16:50.051
Heracleo is your guest,

16:50.118 --> 16:51.819
and I am at your will.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.854
It is an honor for me
to be across from the man

16:53.921 --> 16:56.090
who steals an entire fucking city!

16:56.157 --> 16:59.493
It was the fucking Romans
who stole freedom from us.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.795
We merely seize what is owed.

17:01.863 --> 17:03.463
I favor turn of your reason,

17:03.531 --> 17:05.265
brothers.

17:05.333 --> 17:08.234
Some Romans yet live within Sinuessa?

17:08.301 --> 17:09.269
A few.

17:09.337 --> 17:10.804
The Aedile among them?

17:14.943 --> 17:17.243
He does not.

17:17.311 --> 17:18.244
You are sure of this?

17:18.313 --> 17:20.012
His villa now stands ours.

17:20.080 --> 17:22.549
His claim to it severed by my own hand.

17:22.617 --> 17:24.284
Then I too have been injured.

17:26.887 --> 17:28.989
This man speaks in fucking riddles.

17:29.057 --> 17:30.190
<i>Hmm.</i>

17:32.160 --> 17:34.429
Straighten tongue,

17:34.497 --> 17:38.267
or fall from presence.

17:38.334 --> 17:41.704
The Aedile and I had an arrangement.

17:41.771 --> 17:43.706
He brokered such with men
of your calling?

17:47.277 --> 17:48.778
Openly, no.

17:48.845 --> 17:51.747
Yet many things are
born of dark corners.

17:51.815 --> 17:53.282
The seas are fraught with dangers...

17:53.349 --> 17:55.250
especially for those who,

17:55.318 --> 17:58.987
consider themselves his competitor.

17:59.055 --> 18:01.156
In return for your "services"?

18:01.224 --> 18:05.928
Knowledge of time and route
of unfortunate vessels.

18:05.996 --> 18:08.864
All goods aboard, added to my own,

18:08.932 --> 18:11.800
with the seal of the Aedile

18:11.868 --> 18:14.036
pressed upon new manifest.

18:15.905 --> 18:17.539
What cause does thief upon wave

18:17.607 --> 18:19.407
<i>need of parchment and seal?</i>

18:20.743 --> 18:23.978
<i>The official seal removes</i>
<i>unwanted attention when</i>

18:24.046 --> 18:27.548
trading acquisitions in respected ports.

18:27.616 --> 18:30.652
Advantage snatched from hand,

18:30.720 --> 18:33.989
by fucking action of your own.

18:34.057 --> 18:35.925
<i>To shit with this grinning cunt.</i>

18:35.993 --> 18:36.960
Agron.

18:37.027 --> 18:39.162
What threat does he hold?

18:39.229 --> 18:41.330
Pissing on us from the sea?

18:41.398 --> 18:42.331
You would be surprised

18:42.399 --> 18:44.667
by the reach of my stream, boy.

18:44.735 --> 18:47.737
Let's us take breath then,

18:47.804 --> 18:50.473
remove ourselves from heated words.

18:50.541 --> 18:52.975
There is yet drink to be had.

18:53.043 --> 18:55.711
Return when sun gives way to moon.

18:55.779 --> 18:59.649
And discover if there
stands cause to share cup.

18:59.716 --> 19:03.653
As you command, King Spartacus.

19:03.721 --> 19:04.988
As you command.

19:11.763 --> 19:15.231
The man swings cock
to rival Jupiter himself.

19:15.299 --> 19:18.935
Close gate upon ass,
and be done with him.

19:19.002 --> 19:21.771
He may yet be of use.

19:21.839 --> 19:23.673
Find Aedile's seal,

19:23.741 --> 19:26.209
and let us weigh advantage it brings.

19:26.277 --> 19:27.877
<i>Cilicians!</i>

19:27.945 --> 19:30.447
Shit rises to fill mouth.

19:30.514 --> 19:33.283
Have you laid eyes upon it or not?

19:33.350 --> 19:36.987
I forge steel,
not trade at fucking ports.

19:37.054 --> 19:39.289
What need would I have of Aedile's seal?

19:39.357 --> 19:41.091
Words I would have greeted sooner.

19:41.158 --> 19:43.126
Is that what it was like,

19:43.194 --> 19:45.194
before you gained your freedom?

19:45.262 --> 19:47.964
Were you made to fight
as an animal would,

19:48.031 --> 19:50.333
as you made poor Ulpianus?

19:50.401 --> 19:51.801
I prompted no contest.

19:51.869 --> 19:53.669
Yet you did not stop it.

19:53.737 --> 19:55.738
What fate did you believe

19:55.806 --> 19:57.673
when deciding to aid in taking the city?

19:57.741 --> 19:59.342
I held no fucking choice.

19:59.409 --> 20:02.078
Every man holds such at time's end.

20:02.146 --> 20:05.048
You hold no love
for these people, Attius.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.350
Do not now raise vaunted concerns now.

20:07.418 --> 20:08.918
"These people."

20:08.986 --> 20:11.221
Am I not Roman, as they were?

20:11.289 --> 20:15.492
As some yet are?

20:15.559 --> 20:18.094
You stand for yourself alone.

20:18.162 --> 20:21.698
As I once stood.

20:21.766 --> 20:23.400
You are proof then.

20:23.468 --> 20:25.469
That basest clay

20:25.537 --> 20:28.572
may yet be molded into
something of worth.

20:31.876 --> 20:33.611
Turn from past,

20:33.679 --> 20:35.880
set eye toward new horizon,

20:35.947 --> 20:38.282
far from this place
and the man that you were.

20:54.231 --> 20:58.835
Praise fucking gods,
I've found men of worth.

20:58.902 --> 21:01.270
What crude form do you deposit at feet?

21:01.338 --> 21:02.672
Sinuessa.

21:02.739 --> 21:06.075
Spartacus has taken Sinuessa en Valle.

21:06.143 --> 21:08.311
Summon Mummius.

21:08.378 --> 21:09.445
Wine.

21:13.317 --> 21:14.250
Gratitude.

21:14.318 --> 21:16.652
Repay favor with gift of words.

21:16.720 --> 21:18.288
I have few of note.

21:18.355 --> 21:20.357
We thought the gate secure.

21:20.424 --> 21:22.626
Yet Spartacus is of the underworld,

21:22.694 --> 21:25.129
able to spirit himself
through wood and stone.

21:25.196 --> 21:26.630
He is but a man.

21:26.698 --> 21:29.000
I've laid eyes upon him.

21:29.067 --> 21:30.401
Bathed in blood and gore.

21:30.469 --> 21:32.570
The city trembling in his wake.

21:32.638 --> 21:34.472
Spartacus is no man.

21:34.540 --> 21:35.873
He's the Bringer of Death.

21:35.941 --> 21:39.777
And yet you live.

21:39.845 --> 21:41.312
Your skill in combat must equal

21:41.379 --> 21:43.581
that of the legend himself.

21:43.649 --> 21:44.882
I was paid but a few coin

21:44.950 --> 21:46.351
by the Aedile to aid in curfew.

21:46.418 --> 21:47.285
I'm no soldier.

21:47.352 --> 21:48.920
Put such question aside.

21:48.988 --> 21:51.322
How many men does Spartacus now hold?

21:51.390 --> 21:52.757
I do not know.

21:52.825 --> 21:54.359
<i>The streets were filled with them,</i>

21:54.427 --> 21:56.528
slaughtering all in their path.

21:56.595 --> 21:57.528
I barely made escape

21:57.596 --> 21:59.363
to the bay before they took the docks.

21:59.431 --> 22:01.832
Now it becomes clear.

22:01.900 --> 22:03.500
<i>In place of falling a hero,</i>

22:03.568 --> 22:06.369
you chose to flee.

22:06.437 --> 22:07.637
And fall a coward.

22:13.312 --> 22:14.445
Have you lost mind?

22:14.513 --> 22:16.848
The man held no worth,
by his own tongue.

22:16.915 --> 22:19.084
You are not in fucking command.

22:21.887 --> 22:23.454
Apologies.

22:23.522 --> 22:24.555
I slip from reason...

22:24.623 --> 22:26.858
when presented with
the faults of lesser men.

22:28.928 --> 22:30.962
Let us see body removed,
and discuss--

22:31.030 --> 22:35.133
The time for words has ended.

22:35.201 --> 22:36.301
Break camp,

22:36.369 --> 22:38.403
and return to my father
with news of Spartacus.

22:38.471 --> 22:42.608
He gave order to remain at your side.

22:42.676 --> 22:45.144
I am the word and the will

22:45.212 --> 22:47.480
of Marcus Crassus.

22:47.548 --> 22:50.717
You are not at my side, Gaius.

22:50.785 --> 22:52.052
You serve beneath me.

22:58.092 --> 22:59.593
I fall to command.

23:03.498 --> 23:06.700
Gather what remains of your men.

23:06.768 --> 23:08.802
We move for Sinuessa en Valle.

23:30.590 --> 23:32.258
Leave us.

23:38.532 --> 23:41.500
This stood my home.

23:41.568 --> 23:43.335
No longer.

23:48.742 --> 23:52.311
I will not beg for my life.

23:52.378 --> 23:54.112
I do not seek it.

23:54.180 --> 23:57.516
Only your aid.

23:57.584 --> 24:01.687
You rob me of my husband.

24:01.755 --> 24:04.456
Lay waste to my city.

24:04.524 --> 24:06.258
And now you call upon fucking aid?

24:06.326 --> 24:08.260
We are at war.

24:08.328 --> 24:10.730
You and your people stand casualty.

24:10.797 --> 24:14.567
My own ranks question sparing
a few that yet draw breath.

24:14.634 --> 24:18.270
I give chance to prove wisdom of it.

24:18.338 --> 24:19.471
So we may live out our days

24:19.539 --> 24:22.841
as party favors for
your fucking amusement?

24:22.909 --> 24:25.878
As word carries of Ulpianus?

24:25.945 --> 24:28.046
Ulpianus?

24:28.114 --> 24:30.882
Your men made him fight
for crust of bread.

24:30.950 --> 24:33.351
And claimed hand even
though he stood victor.

24:33.419 --> 24:34.986
A thing I did not know of.

24:35.054 --> 24:36.421
<i>It shall not pass again.</i>

24:40.392 --> 24:43.594
I took belief in your
reassurance once before.

24:43.662 --> 24:44.929
And now stand widow for it.

24:44.997 --> 24:46.564
I do not turn from what I have done.

24:46.632 --> 24:48.733
He was an honorable man!

24:48.800 --> 24:51.002
Forever stricken from this world by you!

24:51.069 --> 24:52.630
You elevate the dead beyond their worth.

24:52.671 --> 24:55.807
You did not know him.

24:55.875 --> 24:59.511
Nor I fear did you.

24:59.579 --> 25:02.715
The name Heracleo holds meaning?

25:02.783 --> 25:06.285
A plague upon the sea.

25:06.353 --> 25:08.989
My husband devoted
much coin toward his capture.

25:09.056 --> 25:10.624
He devoted greater sum,

25:10.692 --> 25:13.060
towards secret pact.

25:13.128 --> 25:14.395
You lie.

25:14.462 --> 25:16.997
Your husband provided seal of office

25:17.065 --> 25:20.434
in exchange for
dispatching of his rivals.

25:20.502 --> 25:22.403
Presented to me by Heracleo himself.

25:32.180 --> 25:33.580
Know that I do not take pleasure

25:33.648 --> 25:35.516
in staining cherished memory.

25:35.583 --> 25:36.717
You tear world from grasp,

25:36.784 --> 25:38.252
and whisper of kindness.

25:38.319 --> 25:41.588
I whisper of opportunity.

25:41.656 --> 25:44.157
Heracleo seeks the Aedile's seal.

25:44.225 --> 25:45.659
With it I will forge trade

25:45.727 --> 25:47.528
that will see us fed.

25:47.595 --> 25:50.097
It eludes discovery.

25:50.164 --> 25:53.833
You know of the seal's location?

25:53.901 --> 25:55.168
Ennius feared rebellion,

25:55.236 --> 25:58.104
and took measure
to protect what was his.

25:58.172 --> 26:00.373
There are many places hidden to eye

26:00.441 --> 26:02.943
among his holdings throughout the city.

26:03.010 --> 26:04.744
Aid in revealing them,

26:04.812 --> 26:06.579
and you and your people will share equal

26:06.647 --> 26:12.051
portion from what we gain
in bargain with the Cilician.

26:12.118 --> 26:14.020
I would have freedom as price.

26:14.087 --> 26:17.690
For all of us.

26:17.758 --> 26:20.761
Do this thing,

26:20.828 --> 26:21.595
and you will be released,

26:21.663 --> 26:24.498
when we take leave of Sinuessa.

26:24.566 --> 26:26.934
Am I to trust your word?

26:27.002 --> 26:29.504
The reason is simple.

26:32.240 --> 26:33.941
You stand absent choice.

26:42.183 --> 26:46.186
Hidden within blushed eye,
the guardian spirits.

26:46.253 --> 26:49.355
Is it a wonder the gods
turned on your husband

26:49.423 --> 26:50.623
and this fucking city?

26:50.691 --> 26:52.024
Let us turn from past

26:52.092 --> 26:53.860
and set gaze towards favored bargain.

26:53.927 --> 26:55.595
And fall to much needed drink!

26:59.200 --> 27:00.733
How much would you have for it?

27:00.801 --> 27:03.136
I ask for nothing.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.837
Upon our abandoning the city,

27:04.905 --> 27:06.472
the seal is yours.

27:06.540 --> 27:08.641
And until such fated day?

27:08.709 --> 27:10.576
An agreement of trade.

27:10.644 --> 27:12.845
Coin for food.

27:12.913 --> 27:15.448
First shipment from what stores
you have aboard your ships.

27:19.253 --> 27:21.355
You would entreat Poseidon

27:21.422 --> 27:24.091
to shun robes and present ass!

27:24.158 --> 27:25.759
If he stood before me.

27:25.827 --> 27:28.562
Yet he does not.

27:28.630 --> 27:31.932
My supplies are of finest quality.

27:32.000 --> 27:33.434
Eighteen thousand denarii

27:33.502 --> 27:35.669
easily fetched if sold at port.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.238
Absent the Aedile's seal?

27:42.345 --> 27:44.446
You are not the man one expects.

27:45.214 --> 27:46.281
Hmm.

27:50.520 --> 27:52.688
Ten thousand denarii.

27:52.755 --> 27:54.756
If Aedile's wife is added
to the bargain huh.

27:54.824 --> 27:57.660
You mistake me for a Roman.

27:57.727 --> 27:59.261
I do not trade in slaves.

28:03.166 --> 28:05.067
Nor would I, if possessed with such

28:05.135 --> 28:08.003
a ripe cunt.

28:15.112 --> 28:16.813
Twelve thousand denarii.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.948
In hour before sun's rising,

28:19.016 --> 28:21.951
upon landing beyond city walls.

28:22.019 --> 28:23.052
Beyond the city?

28:23.120 --> 28:25.254
Ground absent advantage, brother.

28:25.322 --> 28:27.824
I would not sail into port,
only to be set upon.

28:32.363 --> 28:34.264
Beyond city walls.

28:34.332 --> 28:36.166
In hour before sun rises.

28:36.234 --> 28:37.768
It is settled then.

28:40.472 --> 28:42.440
Now may we have
fucking drink?! Huh!

29:04.297 --> 29:06.998
What fucking piss does Heracleo offer?

29:07.066 --> 29:08.633
Absinthe, by name.

29:08.701 --> 29:10.068
I once drained six cups,

29:10.136 --> 29:12.304
and found myself in heated argument

29:12.372 --> 29:14.406
with imaginary cat.

29:16.943 --> 29:19.678
<i>Then let us drain seven,</i>
<i>and finish argument</i>

29:19.746 --> 29:21.747
before you strike from Roman shores.

29:21.815 --> 29:22.748
Yes.

29:35.161 --> 29:37.529
Dangerous thing.

29:37.597 --> 29:41.334
Eyes upon man not your own.

29:41.401 --> 29:45.304
Apologies.
I meant no offense.

29:45.372 --> 29:49.675
You want his cock inside you?

29:49.743 --> 29:52.778
Speak, little thing.

29:52.846 --> 29:54.380
<i>Nemetes, you cock eater!</i>

29:54.448 --> 29:56.516
He saved my life.

29:56.583 --> 29:59.018
I desire only to thank him.

30:03.390 --> 30:04.591
Come.

30:11.598 --> 30:13.699
I do not care for these Cilicians.

30:19.773 --> 30:22.174
Yet they are preferred to Romans.

30:24.678 --> 30:28.314
My cock is magic.

30:28.382 --> 30:30.283
Then see it vanish from sight.

30:33.486 --> 30:34.654
<i>More wine!</i>

30:39.827 --> 30:42.462
You're a fool.

30:42.529 --> 30:47.634
To lay trust in one
stitched of lies and deceit.

30:47.701 --> 30:50.804
I'm no stranger to his kind.

30:50.871 --> 30:54.674
I thought myself so.

30:54.742 --> 30:57.610
Yet now replay every moment.

30:57.678 --> 31:00.813
<i>Every touch my husband laid upon me.</i>

31:00.881 --> 31:04.017
<i>Questioning truth behind them.</i>

31:04.084 --> 31:07.654
The gods punish me for being so blind.

31:07.722 --> 31:10.223
Would that you had let Heracleo take me,

31:10.291 --> 31:12.259
to see their wrath complete.

31:12.326 --> 31:15.161
I place no stock in your gods.

31:15.229 --> 31:16.963
Nor any that would seek injury

31:17.031 --> 31:19.299
for crimes against those undeserving.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.675
I have given command

31:27.743 --> 31:31.345
that you are free to move about city.

31:31.413 --> 31:36.083
In return,

31:36.151 --> 31:38.519
you will lend hand

31:43.792 --> 31:47.094
and carry word to me if any
should fall to mistreatment.

31:47.162 --> 31:49.263
It surprises,

31:49.331 --> 31:53.267
how such small a weight
bears such heavy burden.

31:55.737 --> 31:56.637
A truth known to all

31:56.705 --> 31:58.673
who take up arms against Rome.

32:04.112 --> 32:05.946
You shall sleep where you are.

32:06.014 --> 32:07.135
My people will turn from me,

32:07.182 --> 32:11.618
if I'm known to bed beneath your roof.

32:11.686 --> 32:14.955
My husband held stable at edge of city.

32:15.022 --> 32:16.856
I would take shelter within its walls.

32:22.630 --> 32:25.231
I sought only to provide comfort.

32:34.775 --> 32:36.776
Heracleo spoke the truth,

32:36.843 --> 32:39.745
at least upon one subject.

32:39.813 --> 32:42.548
You are not the man one expects.

33:02.036 --> 33:03.302
Apologies.

33:03.370 --> 33:06.105
Share drink, and see them accepted.

33:06.173 --> 33:07.940
My cup is spoken for.

33:08.008 --> 33:10.276
I seek not to claim it my own.

33:10.344 --> 33:13.346
Merely grace lips with its nectar.

33:16.583 --> 33:19.419
You are bold of words.

33:19.486 --> 33:21.120
I have been too long at sea

33:21.188 --> 33:26.426
among, rough company.

33:26.493 --> 33:29.929
I do not favor crashing waves.

33:29.997 --> 33:32.631
Words from mouth such as yours

33:32.699 --> 33:37.336
could move a man
to forever turn from them.

33:37.403 --> 33:40.272
Remove fucking hand.

33:40.339 --> 33:42.040
Apologies.

33:42.108 --> 33:45.309
I did not know you were mired in shit

33:45.377 --> 33:46.577
East of the Rhine.

33:53.686 --> 33:54.986
<i>Smash him!</i>

33:58.992 --> 34:00.092
Agron!

34:15.243 --> 34:16.377
Agron!

34:19.214 --> 34:20.714
Fall from sight.

34:25.853 --> 34:28.121
Revelry has struck sour note.

34:28.188 --> 34:31.456
I would not have senseless
quarrel open gap between us.

34:31.525 --> 34:34.159
Then see it filled with coin

34:34.228 --> 34:36.062
at appointed hour.

34:36.129 --> 34:39.264
And we shall test
sureness of our footing.

34:52.580 --> 34:54.949
Spartacus stands displeased
with celebration's end.

34:55.016 --> 34:56.350
I was not the one who caused offense.

34:56.418 --> 34:57.618
The Cilician overstepped,

34:57.686 --> 34:58.619
yet your
response was--

34:58.687 --> 35:01.024
Was as it fucking should be.

35:01.852 --> 35:03.891
Jupiter himself would find cause

35:03.958 --> 35:07.006
to tremble if he laid hand upon you.

35:09.965 --> 35:14.302
You would battle a god for me?

35:14.369 --> 35:16.304
I would slay all

35:16.372 --> 35:19.207
that would lay attempt
to wrest you from my arms.

35:19.274 --> 35:22.944
Strike Jupiter
and the Cilician from mind.

35:23.012 --> 35:24.245
I would have them of no concern

35:24.313 --> 35:26.581
to the one that holds my heart.

36:24.207 --> 36:27.777
You left absent word.

36:27.844 --> 36:29.979
There was a fight.

36:30.047 --> 36:32.748
It was very loud.

36:38.822 --> 36:40.890
I leave to make shadow flesh.

36:40.958 --> 36:41.991
Yeah.

36:49.232 --> 36:51.500
...and to bring desire.

36:55.005 --> 36:56.272
For you.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.144
Come.

38:11.280 --> 38:14.282
Gather your robes and leave us.

38:14.350 --> 38:15.416
Go.

38:30.067 --> 38:31.834
She does not please?

38:31.902 --> 38:35.538
She is but a child.

38:35.606 --> 38:40.743
And I would have
a woman tend to my needs,

38:40.811 --> 38:43.979
in brief hours before
I move with Spartacus...

39:12.609 --> 39:13.810
Apologies.

39:13.877 --> 39:14.811
I would have words.

39:14.878 --> 39:16.279
I would not.

39:16.346 --> 39:20.016
You've not given opportunity
towards gratitude.

39:20.084 --> 39:22.452
I yet draw breath because of you.

39:22.519 --> 39:25.254
Your dominus fell to an act of war.

39:25.322 --> 39:28.291
He fell to a hero sent by the gods.

39:30.794 --> 39:33.863
One that does not even recall your name.

39:33.931 --> 39:35.699
My name is Sibyl.

39:35.766 --> 39:37.634
Sibyl.

39:37.702 --> 39:40.337
And you feel you owe debt Sibyl?

39:40.404 --> 39:44.875
I owe you everything.

39:44.942 --> 39:47.577
Then see it repaid

39:47.645 --> 39:50.346
by staying far from my presence.

39:50.414 --> 39:52.715
And men of my kind.

39:59.055 --> 40:00.489
You would claim all that I have earned?

40:00.557 --> 40:01.990
All you have stolen.

40:02.058 --> 40:03.525
Did I not stand with my brothers

40:03.593 --> 40:05.060
when city was taken,

40:05.128 --> 40:06.928
risking life beside you?

40:06.996 --> 40:08.764
As I did in shadow of Vesuvius

40:08.831 --> 40:10.232
and every fucking battle since?

40:10.300 --> 40:11.534
As all that follow cause.

40:11.601 --> 40:14.370
Know that you do not
stand alone in sacrifice.

40:14.438 --> 40:15.538
And what of the blacksmith?

40:15.606 --> 40:17.340
Did you seize coin given him as well?

40:17.407 --> 40:20.276
You mistake command for conversation.

40:20.344 --> 40:21.778
Fall to your purpose.

40:25.116 --> 40:26.283
You carry the balance?

40:26.350 --> 40:28.351
He does.

40:28.419 --> 40:29.853
Where is Gannicus?

40:29.921 --> 40:31.822
He comes upon heel.

40:31.890 --> 40:33.357
What is left of him.

40:40.932 --> 40:41.865
<i>Totus!</i>

40:41.933 --> 40:45.602
Fall to task.

40:45.670 --> 40:46.636
We are committed.

40:46.704 --> 40:49.339
<i>Nasir, take position upon wall.</i>

40:50.808 --> 40:52.909
I would stand with you.

40:52.977 --> 40:54.277
Go.

40:54.344 --> 40:56.145
I shall return shortly.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.751
Once gate closes behind us,

41:02.819 --> 41:05.387
do not see it raised short of my word.

41:08.323 --> 41:11.025
Terms of stroll worsen
by passing moment.

41:11.093 --> 41:14.162
Keep watchful eye
towards sign of betrayal.

41:14.229 --> 41:16.331
I pray they make fucking attempt.

41:16.398 --> 41:18.867
If Heracleo and his men,

41:18.935 --> 41:23.138
prove short of honor...

41:23.206 --> 41:25.875
kill them where they stand.

41:25.943 --> 41:27.010
Raise the gate!

41:38.523 --> 41:40.390
<i>Cilicians, by the look.</i>

41:42.993 --> 41:45.494
Why would they take landing
outside Sinuessa?

41:50.400 --> 41:52.101
To seek alliance.

41:52.169 --> 41:53.469
Spartacus stands the fool

41:53.537 --> 41:55.405
if he risks dealings with such as them.

41:55.472 --> 41:58.976
They are thieves of equal nature.

41:59.044 --> 42:00.244
And if they come to terms

42:00.312 --> 42:01.645
it would prevent my father

42:01.713 --> 42:03.648
<i>from starving the rebels out.</i>

42:05.618 --> 42:08.386
A thing I will not have fall to pass.

42:08.454 --> 42:09.488
Mummius,

42:09.555 --> 42:11.857
prepare your men to advance.

42:11.925 --> 42:13.158
Advance?

42:13.226 --> 42:15.527
Fall to fucking command.

42:20.400 --> 42:22.134
Tiberius, your father gave strict order

42:22.202 --> 42:23.835
not to engage Spartacus.

42:23.903 --> 42:28.206
My father desires a wolf of battle,

42:28.274 --> 42:32.177
not a well-heeled dog.

42:32.244 --> 42:35.447
And this night I shall honor him

42:35.514 --> 42:38.083
with blood and death.

42:46.226 --> 42:50.062
We are too exposed.

42:50.130 --> 42:52.765
Spartacus and his men more so,

42:52.833 --> 42:55.734
beyond the walls of his city.

42:55.802 --> 42:59.604
They spill from gate.

42:59.672 --> 43:02.039
Upon my signal only.

43:02.107 --> 43:04.909
I would give no errant
cause to doubt intention.

43:13.651 --> 43:17.154
Nasir, what do you see?

43:17.222 --> 43:19.656
Shit and piss.

43:19.724 --> 43:21.925
<i>They are too far in darkness.</i>

43:28.166 --> 43:30.201
What does she say?

43:30.269 --> 43:33.371
Roman your man make fight gone.

43:33.439 --> 43:34.539
Ulpianus?

43:34.607 --> 43:36.708
With fat wife and others
chained with him.

43:36.776 --> 43:37.776
We must sweep the city --

43:37.777 --> 43:40.078
No.
Remain here.

43:40.146 --> 43:41.079
It may be distraction,

43:41.147 --> 43:44.549
to draw us from the gate.

43:44.617 --> 43:45.550
Where do you go?

43:45.618 --> 43:47.853
Do not tear eyes from purpose!

43:56.363 --> 43:58.431
Your price.

43:58.498 --> 44:01.300
As agreed upon.

44:01.368 --> 44:02.568
Apologies, I mean no offense,

44:02.636 --> 44:05.738
yet ah...

44:05.806 --> 44:07.240
Open it.

44:20.720 --> 44:23.889
You stand a man of your word.

44:23.957 --> 44:25.591
A very rare thing, in such a world.

44:25.658 --> 44:27.793
Rarer yet,

44:27.861 --> 44:30.395
to greet my equal.

44:30.463 --> 44:33.231
Castus.
Adherbal.

44:33.299 --> 44:35.366
Bring our brothers what they are owed.

44:45.810 --> 44:49.746
You take leave of the city?

44:49.814 --> 44:52.049
Absent parting words?

44:52.116 --> 44:54.919
I've broken them to all that matter.

44:54.987 --> 44:57.389
If dealings with
the Cilicians end as desired,

44:57.456 --> 45:00.459
I will buy passage far
from your fucking presence.

45:00.526 --> 45:02.628
Do you buy such
for your friends as well?

45:02.696 --> 45:03.629
Friends?

45:07.168 --> 45:08.475
Tell me where there are.

45:08.595 --> 45:09.528
Wait!

45:09.596 --> 45:10.596
I do not know what you speak of!

45:10.664 --> 45:11.797
I speak of Romans.

45:11.865 --> 45:13.465
And your fucking treachery.

45:19.572 --> 45:21.506
Fuck!

45:21.574 --> 45:22.741
You wish for blood?

45:22.808 --> 45:23.775
Come then.

45:23.842 --> 45:25.343
And find greater challenge than that

45:25.410 --> 45:27.044
of a simple crafter of bread

45:27.112 --> 45:28.111
in fucking chains.

45:42.974 --> 45:44.475
This,

45:44.543 --> 45:48.112
this stands the sum of your offerings?

45:48.180 --> 45:51.983
Fuck the gods, no!

45:52.051 --> 45:54.486
A mere sample for your approval.

45:54.553 --> 45:58.089
The remainder lies aboard my ships,

45:58.157 --> 46:02.893
too great a cargo to ferry by skiff.

46:02.961 --> 46:04.895
Now that payment has been received,

46:04.963 --> 46:06.530
I shall
sail into port --

46:06.598 --> 46:09.199
That was not the arrangement.

46:09.267 --> 46:10.334
Apologies,

46:10.401 --> 46:11.702
if you fell to confusion.

46:11.770 --> 46:14.138
Fuck your apologies.

46:14.205 --> 46:15.439
Hold ground!

46:25.717 --> 46:27.885
What are your thoughts?

46:27.953 --> 46:30.121
That I stand the fool.

46:30.189 --> 46:34.992
For laying trust in a man absent honor.

46:35.060 --> 46:36.461
Then perhaps the time has come.

46:36.528 --> 46:37.729
For us to...

46:37.796 --> 46:39.664
forever part ways...

46:45.374 --> 46:46.374
We are betrayed!

46:46.442 --> 46:49.844
This is not my hand!

46:49.912 --> 46:51.179
Fucking pirates!

46:57.653 --> 46:59.554
Advance!

47:02.458 --> 47:03.892
Romans!

48:13.495 --> 48:15.529
Where the fuck is Mummius?!

48:15.597 --> 48:16.530
Fuck!

49:02.111 --> 49:04.512
I have had my fill...

49:04.580 --> 49:06.514
Of men such as you...

49:50.549 --> 49:53.595
Mummius?

49:53.663 --> 49:54.796
Spartacus!

49:54.864 --> 49:56.198
<i>More come!</i>

50:05.843 --> 50:07.577
Spartacus...

50:14.184 --> 50:15.785
Attack!

50:37.208 --> 50:38.608
Testudo!

50:56.930 --> 50:58.063
Load!

50:58.131 --> 50:59.398
Fire!

51:06.140 --> 51:09.175
Did I not warn you of my fucking reach!

51:09.243 --> 51:12.278
<i>I warned you!</i>

51:12.346 --> 51:14.213
Yeah!

51:31.164 --> 51:32.097
Stand ground!

51:32.165 --> 51:33.132
Retreat!

51:33.199 --> 51:34.900
Stand your fucking ground!

51:34.968 --> 51:36.268
Retreat!

51:44.578 --> 51:45.678
<i>Retreat!</i>

51:58.759 --> 51:59.792
Totus!

52:14.809 --> 52:15.742
We must retreat.

52:15.809 --> 52:16.776
No...

52:16.844 --> 52:18.244
I will not see you fall!

52:26.153 --> 52:27.086
<i>After them!</i>

52:27.154 --> 52:28.288
Let them go!

52:28.355 --> 52:29.422
We must return to the city!

52:29.490 --> 52:30.524
Now!

52:30.591 --> 52:33.093
<i>Retreat!</i>

52:33.160 --> 52:35.629
How stand your thoughts now,
King Spartacus?

52:35.696 --> 52:36.863
Take coin.

52:36.931 --> 52:38.799
And see your ships to port.

52:38.866 --> 52:40.400
Come!

52:40.468 --> 52:41.534
We go!

53:11.366 --> 53:13.734
I thought you gone from this world.

53:13.801 --> 53:15.669
You will not so easily
see me from your arms.

53:15.736 --> 53:18.371
I attempted to come to your aid.

53:18.439 --> 53:21.207
Nemetes and his
shits would not open gate.

53:21.275 --> 53:22.375
If gate had been breached,

53:22.442 --> 53:24.376
more would have fallen.

53:24.444 --> 53:25.978
He but followed command.

53:33.787 --> 53:35.087
Confounds why the Romans

53:35.155 --> 53:36.455
attacked in such small numbers,

53:36.522 --> 53:38.791
led by a boy.

53:38.859 --> 53:40.793
It holds no sense.

53:40.860 --> 53:42.861
<i>Answer lay among the dead.</i>

53:47.168 --> 53:51.270
And those we mistakenly name friend.

53:59.346 --> 54:02.015
He came at me,

54:02.082 --> 54:04.384
when confronted with
question of aiding Ulpianus

54:04.451 --> 54:06.152
and the others in escape.

54:06.220 --> 54:08.655
You were left absent choice.

54:08.723 --> 54:11.124
Would he lend hand in taking city,

54:11.192 --> 54:13.293
only to risk life in such attempt?

54:13.361 --> 54:15.462
He but sought to form basest clay,

54:15.529 --> 54:17.230
into something of worth.

54:17.298 --> 54:20.200
There stands matters
of more pressing concern.

54:20.520 --> 54:22.855
Let us sweep city
for Ulpianus and the others.

54:22.923 --> 54:24.223
I would not have Romans
plotting beneath foot,

54:24.291 --> 54:25.858
or seeking greater harm.

54:49.816 --> 54:51.150
Gratitude.

54:51.218 --> 54:52.218
<i>There's more over here.</i>
