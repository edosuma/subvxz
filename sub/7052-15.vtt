00:15.265 --> 00:16.289
God, it's cold.

00:16.466 --> 00:19.958
- I'm getting too damn old for this.
- Make sure that blast cap's on tight.

00:20.136 --> 00:22.832
It's not the cap I'm worried about,
it's my damn fingers.

00:23.006 --> 00:25.941
Stop complaining.
We fall behind, we violate our permit.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.770
Just a minute, almost there.

00:27.944 --> 00:30.777
- Zone 1, clear.
- Zone 2 is clear.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.472
- Zone 3, clear.
- Zone 4, clear.

00:35.251 --> 00:36.616
Got a squatter in Zone 5.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.414
Getting him out.
After that, we're clear here too.

00:39.723 --> 00:41.281
Zone 6, clear.

00:41.458 --> 00:45.121
Okay, people. Building's clean.
Wrap it up and get out.

00:45.729 --> 00:48.425
Go for demolition in three minutes.

00:48.598 --> 00:50.327
D-minus-three minutes.

00:50.500 --> 00:54.129
So, what's up, man?
Stateside Diner? Meatloaf sandwich?

00:54.304 --> 00:55.965
Thinking steak and eggs at Cora's.

00:56.139 --> 01:00.235
Or we could always head up Route 9
to Parkview.

01:00.510 --> 01:02.705
- Sure.
- What?

01:02.879 --> 01:05.438
"What?" The waitress, the brunette.
What's her name?

01:05.615 --> 01:08.948
Marcy? No, I wasn't even... I was
thinking about the lean corned beef.

01:09.119 --> 01:11.110
Yeah, right.
The lean corned beef named Marcy.

01:13.957 --> 01:15.515
Hold up.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.524
What's the matter?

01:20.396 --> 01:22.193
You okay?

01:23.266 --> 01:24.893
Dennis?

01:25.068 --> 01:27.468
- What's the problem?
- Nothing.

01:27.637 --> 01:29.400
- I don't know.
- You swept it, right?

01:29.572 --> 01:32.541
Sure. I just...

01:35.478 --> 01:37.969
I don't know. All of a sudden,
I got a weird feeling.

01:38.148 --> 01:41.345
Yeah? Me too. Mine's called,
"I don't wanna die looking at Dennis."

01:41.518 --> 01:43.349
Come on, man.

01:44.921 --> 01:48.220
Hey, radio Mike, will you?
Tell him I wanna do another sweep.

01:48.391 --> 01:49.858
Come on, man. Where you going?

01:52.996 --> 01:55.157
Dennis, they're holding
the countdown for us.

01:55.331 --> 01:58.164
- Damn it. Over here, let's go.
- Where are we going?

01:58.334 --> 02:00.529
I think we missed something.

02:00.703 --> 02:04.070
Plans show another room over here.
God, this doesn't make sense.

02:04.240 --> 02:06.105
Phil, you got Dennis? What's going on?

02:06.309 --> 02:09.369
- We don't have a lot of time.
- Two more minutes. We'll be right up.

02:11.614 --> 02:14.048
- You hear that?
- What?

02:15.518 --> 02:18.180
- Sounds hollow.
- This place has been completely prepped.

02:18.354 --> 02:21.289
There's nothing underneath there.
It's a solid foundation.

02:21.457 --> 02:24.119
- That sound solid to you?
- It's probably frost damage.

02:24.327 --> 02:26.727
The concrete's cracked. Man...

02:33.870 --> 02:36.361
Mike, I think
you should come down here.

02:41.544 --> 02:46.208
This was definitely not
in the blueprints.

02:57.927 --> 02:59.622
God, what's that smell?

03:00.129 --> 03:03.826
- What do you think this was?
- I don't know, but it's old.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.628
Oh, good, that narrows it down.

03:41.337 --> 03:43.532
What the hell?

03:49.212 --> 03:50.679
My God.

04:34.257 --> 04:35.315
Ella?

04:35.491 --> 04:38.255
Mommy gets grumpy
if I wake her too early.

04:40.196 --> 04:42.460
She always did.

04:42.765 --> 04:44.392
Come here.

04:47.170 --> 04:50.105
Do you want some pancakes?

04:50.273 --> 04:51.433
Yes.

04:51.607 --> 04:53.165
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

04:54.911 --> 04:56.105
Francis.

04:56.279 --> 04:58.839
Hey, Jim. How are you, buddy?

04:59.015 --> 05:01.916
I saw that your mayor got himself
in a little bit of trouble.

05:02.085 --> 05:04.849
That couldn't have been fun
for you guys.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.418
When?

05:08.591 --> 05:11.424
Has anyone taken anything from that fax
in the last five minutes?

05:11.594 --> 05:13.084
- No, sir.
- Didn't see it.

05:13.262 --> 05:14.991
I'll call you back.

05:28.378 --> 05:32.542
Ugh. Liv, I'm sorry.
I told her to let you sleep late.

05:32.715 --> 05:36.412
- Oh, she did. Until 6:17.
- Yup, that sounds late for her.

05:36.586 --> 05:37.746
Which one?

05:37.920 --> 05:39.615
Uh, the yellow one.

05:39.789 --> 05:42.019
- Aunt Liv?
- Definitely the yellow.

05:42.325 --> 05:43.952
Did you tell her?

05:44.127 --> 05:46.561
- Go get dressed.
- Okay.

05:46.729 --> 05:48.219
What?

05:48.798 --> 05:52.165
We went apartment hunting
yesterday.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.900
Really? You're thinking
of moving to Boston?

05:55.071 --> 05:58.507
Yeah, well, Ella loves it here
and so do I, so...

05:58.674 --> 06:01.268
- You can stay here as long as you want.
- I know.

06:01.444 --> 06:05.403
But you don't need a little creature
waking you up at 6:17 every morning.

06:06.949 --> 06:09.008
If that little creature is Ella,
I am fine with it.

06:09.185 --> 06:12.814
- Hello.
- It's me. The Artist is back.

06:15.992 --> 06:18.290
How do you know?
Did we receive another fax?

06:19.362 --> 06:22.456
- Yeah. Hartford office got one too.
- Well, did we get a trace?

06:22.632 --> 06:24.793
Sent from a copy store in Allston.

06:24.967 --> 06:27.959
I've got Mason and Lewis headed over
to question the employees.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.833
See if someone can give a description
of whoever sent it.

06:31.007 --> 06:33.567
Okay, I'm gonna be there
in 15 minutes.

06:33.776 --> 06:36.108
Some horrifying event
you're not allowed to tell me about?

06:37.480 --> 06:38.504
Yeah.

06:38.681 --> 06:43.118
- Okay, now it's gonna be 14.
- Excuse me? Agent Dunham?

06:43.286 --> 06:44.844
- Oh, hey.
- Get the Bishops.

06:45.021 --> 06:47.182
I need you to meet me
at Children's Hospital.

06:47.356 --> 06:51.156
- I just had an old case reopen and I...
- It can wait.

06:54.597 --> 06:58.033
After the boy was found,
crews performed a search of the tunnels.

06:58.201 --> 07:01.364
It was determined they'd been
sealed shut for at least 70 years.

07:01.537 --> 07:02.868
The place was a sarcophagus.

07:03.039 --> 07:06.873
The only living things down there
were rats, insects...

07:07.477 --> 07:09.240
...and him.

07:10.546 --> 07:13.106
And we have no idea
how he got down there?

07:15.184 --> 07:16.583
He's so pale.

07:16.752 --> 07:19.243
He seems to be developing
some sort of pigmentation.

07:19.422 --> 07:22.687
Well, he probably hasn't
seen sunlight in years.

07:22.859 --> 07:24.156
Does he have a name?

07:24.327 --> 07:26.420
He hasn't spoken a word
since he was found.

07:26.629 --> 07:28.028
Dr. Bishop, any thoughts?

07:28.197 --> 07:32.258
Perhaps. First,
I need a piece of special equipment.

07:32.435 --> 07:35.768
- My turntable.
- Is that some kind of lab equipment?

07:35.938 --> 07:39.499
No, no, no.
A turntable. Record player.

07:40.143 --> 07:42.407
You enjoy music, don't you,
Mr. Broyles?

07:42.578 --> 07:47.208
Well, imagine the agony of having
an extensive record collection...

07:47.383 --> 07:49.283
...and having no means to play it.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.576
The agony.

07:51.921 --> 07:54.219
I'll have someone get right on that.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.864
This is Dr. Winick, chief of Pediatrics.

08:02.031 --> 08:05.262
Look, I understand your agency's
taken an interest in this child...

08:05.434 --> 08:08.164
...but he's been through quite a trauma.
- Is he sick?

08:08.437 --> 08:11.873
Not as far as we can tell,
but he's having difficulty breathing.

08:12.041 --> 08:15.272
- We need to administer oxygen.
- No, don't. No. I wouldn't do that.

08:15.678 --> 08:18.078
You said the tunnel was sealed.
Is that correct?

08:18.247 --> 08:22.809
It's obvious that the child was trapped in
a low-oxygen environment for so long...

08:22.985 --> 08:26.045
...his body adapted. That's why
he's having trouble breathing.

08:26.222 --> 08:27.382
I don't think so.

08:27.557 --> 08:30.492
Unless you have an IQ higher than mine
I'm not interested.

08:30.693 --> 08:32.957
Administering additional oxygen
at this stage...

08:33.129 --> 08:36.394
...would simply cause his lungs to fill
with fluid and drown him where he lies.

08:41.136 --> 08:44.334
We need to deprive him of oxygen.

08:44.507 --> 08:49.308
Get him a nasal cannula and a tank
with low oxygen content.

08:49.478 --> 08:51.241
Perhaps 5 percent to start.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.632
- A griffin.
- Excuse me?

09:13.102 --> 09:17.971
Your tattoo. The body of a lion,
the head of an eagle.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.471
That's a griffin, right?

09:20.243 --> 09:24.009
Just picked it out of the sample book.
Thought it looked cool.

09:24.180 --> 09:27.843
Oh, well, a nice choice.

09:29.252 --> 09:31.311
Did it hurt much?

09:31.487 --> 09:34.388
I always imagined getting a tattoo
would hurt real bad.

09:34.557 --> 09:36.855
It's a good pain.

09:41.297 --> 09:44.755
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to embarrass...
- You didn't.

10:05.921 --> 10:07.548
Hey.

10:08.591 --> 10:09.717
Do you need a hand?

10:10.559 --> 10:11.685
Thanks, I got it.

10:14.363 --> 10:17.992
Actually, you know,
a little help would be great.

10:19.735 --> 10:24.729
- Cool motorcycle. What make?
- '67 Harley Shovelhead.

10:24.907 --> 10:26.306
She's a beauty.

10:27.310 --> 10:29.574
Yeah, she is.

11:05.381 --> 11:07.110
Any minute now.

11:12.955 --> 11:13.979
It worked.

11:15.858 --> 11:20.852
You'll want to increase the oxygen flow
10 percent every hour till he acclimates.

11:21.797 --> 11:26.097
So you said that he hasn't talked.
How do we know he can hear?

11:26.268 --> 11:27.599
He responds to sound.

11:27.770 --> 11:30.762
We examined his tympanic membrane,
there's no physical damage.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.932
In fact, considering how he was found,
he seems fairly healthy.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.307
His heart sounds fine,
his blood pressure's strong.

11:37.480 --> 11:40.176
How do we think he survived
down there? What did he eat?

11:40.383 --> 11:43.352
Rats, I'd think.

11:43.519 --> 11:46.352
Moss, insects, high in protein.

11:46.522 --> 11:49.787
Tastier than you may think,
especially millipedes.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.189
Although they all lack
certain minerals...

11:52.395 --> 11:54.920
...which may account
for his follicular dilemma.

11:55.097 --> 11:58.328
- His baldness.
- Have you performed a urinalysis?

11:58.901 --> 12:01.699
Haven't been able to.
We've been feeding him intravenously.

12:01.904 --> 12:03.963
He hasn't relieved himself
since he arrived.

12:04.140 --> 12:06.768
I can't say I blame him
for not wanting to try this.

12:06.942 --> 12:10.002
Looks worse than the dreadful fill
they served us in Claire's.

12:10.179 --> 12:12.306
You were on staff
at St. Claire's Asylum?

12:12.481 --> 12:15.541
No, no, no. I'm not a medical doctor.
I was a patient.

12:16.952 --> 12:18.681
Got such a sense of humor, huh?

12:18.854 --> 12:23.120
Walter, what do you say we keep those
old St. Claire's stories to ourself, yeah?

12:25.995 --> 12:27.656
Hello.

12:31.867 --> 12:34.665
My name's Olivia. What's yours?

12:39.141 --> 12:41.234
That's my phone.

12:42.878 --> 12:44.709
It's Charlie.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.144
Hi, I'm still in the hospital.

12:47.383 --> 12:52.252
You won't remember this, Peter, but
you didn't talk much either as a child.

12:52.455 --> 12:54.184
Could you get me the address?

12:57.393 --> 12:59.987
Okay, tell him that I'll be there
as soon as I can.

13:02.865 --> 13:06.232
Charlie got a call from the local P.D.
about the Artist.

13:06.402 --> 13:08.495
I'm gonna go meet him now.

13:40.636 --> 13:41.728
What's it say?

13:41.904 --> 13:43.997
- Sam Gilmore.
- He can write?

13:44.306 --> 13:45.773
Is that your name?

13:48.944 --> 13:51.640
I'll see what we have on Sam Gilmores
in Massachusetts.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.574
The body was found just after 6 p.m.

13:56.752 --> 13:59.050
This part of the park's empty
this time of year.

13:59.221 --> 14:02.486
A couple of kids were using it
as a shortcut when they found her.

14:02.658 --> 14:04.319
Definitely the work of the Artist.

14:04.527 --> 14:06.995
He clearly made alterations to the body
postmortem.

14:07.162 --> 14:10.325
And put her here for the world to see.
Here's what we have so far.

14:10.533 --> 14:13.832
She's a local girl.
A process server from Weston.

14:14.036 --> 14:17.733
Next of kin is being notified
by local agents as we speak.

14:18.807 --> 14:20.399
Samantha Gilmore.

14:20.576 --> 14:22.737
Wait, did you say "Sam Gilmore"?

14:23.979 --> 14:27.847
Yeah, Samantha Gilmore.
You know her?

14:33.822 --> 14:35.449
Our perp's name is the Artist.

14:35.624 --> 14:39.458
As some of you may recall, we had our
first encounter with him three years ago.

14:39.628 --> 14:43.689
He killed four women in Lowell and
Jamaica Plain over a period of two days.

14:43.866 --> 14:45.663
After the fourth murder, he stopped.

14:45.834 --> 14:47.825
Are you holding for Dr. Winick?

14:48.003 --> 14:50.198
- Yes.
- One moment, please.

14:50.372 --> 14:52.670
The killing bears
all of the Artist's trademarks.

14:52.841 --> 14:56.140
His m.o. is to kidnap, sedate
and kill his victims.

14:56.312 --> 14:59.941
And then after he kills them,
using surgical tools and chemicals...

15:00.115 --> 15:03.448
...he, in his mind,
enhances their appearance.

15:03.619 --> 15:07.555
In this case, he bleached her skin,
removed piercings and dyed her hair.

15:07.723 --> 15:09.850
- I'll let Dr. Winick know you called.
- Thanks.

15:10.025 --> 15:12.118
It was preceded
with a faxed invitation...

15:12.294 --> 15:14.023
...to view work
to be displayed in public...

15:14.196 --> 15:17.131
- Anything yet?
- No. That was the hospital.

15:17.299 --> 15:19.460
They're giving the boy an MRI.

15:19.635 --> 15:22.195
When he's done, I'm gonna go in
and talk to him again.

15:22.371 --> 15:26.535
In the meantime, I've sent his picture to
Samantha Gilmore's friends and family.

15:26.709 --> 15:29.735
But so far, no one recognizes him.

15:30.713 --> 15:33.409
You didn't really expect
that they would, did you?

15:35.517 --> 15:37.144
No.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.815
So let me ask you the obvious,
what's the connection?

15:47.529 --> 15:51.693
Amala and Kamala,
the wolf girls of India.

15:51.867 --> 15:57.203
And Marie-Angelique Memmie LeBlanc,
the wild girl of Champagne.

15:57.373 --> 16:02.106
They're all feral children who grew up
completely isolated from human contact.

16:02.277 --> 16:06.236
Surviving, like our boy,
for many years alone.

16:06.415 --> 16:08.781
I'm guessing none of them
could write upside down.

16:08.951 --> 16:11.283
You're saying that the boy
grew up down there?

16:11.453 --> 16:13.853
Well, based on the blood work, yes.

16:14.023 --> 16:18.221
I'm fairly certain.
The lack of vitamin D, for one...

16:18.394 --> 16:20.954
But also the complete absence
of Lactobacillus...

16:21.163 --> 16:23.791
Microorganisms that help us digest.
They're everywhere.

16:23.966 --> 16:26.867
Precisely. If the boy had
spent any time above the ground...

16:27.036 --> 16:29.402
...then he certainly would have
absorbed those.

16:29.571 --> 16:31.971
But that still doesn't explain
how he got there.

16:32.174 --> 16:35.769
You said that, that place
had been sealed off for decades.

16:35.944 --> 16:39.380
- The boy couldn't be more than 10?
- Well, he certainly looks that.

16:39.548 --> 16:41.140
You believe he might be older?

16:41.316 --> 16:44.979
Well, given the environmental conditions,
the lack of oxygen, light...

16:45.187 --> 16:47.655
...and their impact
on his biological development...

16:47.823 --> 16:49.882
...he could be significantly older.

16:50.059 --> 16:53.153
But none of that explains
how he knew Samantha Gilmore.

16:53.328 --> 16:54.795
No.

16:54.963 --> 16:57.932
That I can't explain.
But good news, Mr. Broyles...

16:58.600 --> 17:01.228
...I have located my turntable.

17:01.403 --> 17:06.102
So I don't need you
to purchase me one after all.

17:06.275 --> 17:09.472
It was under the sink in the john.

17:09.645 --> 17:12.113
So, obviously,
I was sitting on the toilet...

17:12.281 --> 17:15.647
- Walter. Think that's enough information.
- Agent Dunham.

17:15.818 --> 17:19.276
We just got another one.
The Artist is going after another victim.

17:22.657 --> 17:25.491
Easy. Easy.

17:26.328 --> 17:28.421
- That's a beautiful dog.
- Thank you.

17:28.597 --> 17:30.758
- Is he friendly?
- Of course.

17:30.933 --> 17:35.836
- His name's Mack.
- Hey, Mack. Hey, Mackie.

17:49.952 --> 17:51.044
Hey.

17:53.789 --> 17:55.381
They, uh...

17:56.258 --> 17:58.852
They told me that
you haven't eaten anything solid yet.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.660
So I, uh...

18:06.502 --> 18:11.405
I thought that you might like these
more than the mystery meat.

18:18.714 --> 18:20.807
When I was a kid,
I used to live on these.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.045
Except the yellow.

18:23.218 --> 18:27.177
Something about the color
reminded me of medicine.

18:29.725 --> 18:31.317
You wanna try one?

18:40.435 --> 18:42.835
That's it. Good.

18:54.917 --> 18:56.714
Thank you.

19:13.902 --> 19:16.063
Yesterday you wrote down
a name for me.

19:17.072 --> 19:18.733
Remember?

19:19.341 --> 19:22.276
I thought today you could
give me your name.

19:22.444 --> 19:24.878
You have a real way with him.

19:25.047 --> 19:28.744
Eliot Michaels,
Department of Social Services.

19:29.117 --> 19:31.881
Olivia Dunham, FBI.

19:32.955 --> 19:37.551
Um, do you mind if I borrow
Miss Dunham for a few minutes?

19:37.726 --> 19:40.490
I promise I'll bring her right back.

19:42.865 --> 19:45.060
I'll be just outside.

19:50.606 --> 19:53.734
Dr. Winick brought me up to speed
about your interest in the boy.

19:53.909 --> 19:56.810
Circumstances by which he was found
attracted our interest.

19:56.979 --> 19:58.276
Mm-hm. It's bizarre, huh?

20:03.452 --> 20:06.182
Have you been able to find out
anything more about him?

20:06.388 --> 20:08.322
You know, first name?
Where he's from?

20:08.490 --> 20:10.287
No. I'm afraid, not yet.

20:12.127 --> 20:15.585
I just thought I'd stop by and see him
before I get the ball rolling.

20:17.032 --> 20:18.761
- How so?
- How so?

20:18.934 --> 20:23.030
Well, physically it doesn't seem as if
there's anything really wrong with him.

20:23.205 --> 20:25.469
So I've arranged to have him moved.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.632
- Moved?
- To a facility that can provide...

20:27.809 --> 20:29.538
...the treatment he needs.
- When?

20:29.711 --> 20:33.340
Tomorrow. You know, I hope.
Assuming all the paperwork is in order.

20:46.528 --> 20:48.462
- What's wrong?
- I'm not sure.

20:48.630 --> 20:50.791
His BP and his heart rate are spiking.

20:50.966 --> 20:54.868
It's okay, it's okay. Hey, it's okay.

20:55.070 --> 20:57.834
Shh. It's gonna be okay.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.064
Aww.

21:01.710 --> 21:03.075
Good.

21:03.879 --> 21:06.040
Should I get the doctor?

21:06.581 --> 21:09.641
- I think we're okay.
- All right.

21:10.485 --> 21:14.819
- You're okay there?
- Maybe if you just gave us a moment.

21:14.990 --> 21:18.482
- Of course. Take your time.
- Thank you.

21:27.035 --> 21:31.495
I'm at the hospital.
I think we may have found another one.

21:35.277 --> 21:37.507
I should let you get some rest.

22:02.504 --> 22:06.201
- Anything so far?
- I just got here five seconds ago.

22:06.375 --> 22:08.138
So, what's the plan?

22:08.310 --> 22:12.246
- Start knocking on doors?
- Unless you can think of a better idea.

22:12.414 --> 22:17.249
- All right. You go east, I take west.
- Okay.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.818
Shh.

22:20.255 --> 22:22.223
Shh, shh, shh.

22:38.040 --> 22:40.975
Good. You're very good.

22:51.186 --> 22:53.552
Mind some company?

22:53.955 --> 22:55.820
Of course not.

22:56.091 --> 22:59.993
Did I miss you last night,
or did you not even come home?

23:00.162 --> 23:03.461
Uh, no, you didn't miss me.

23:06.001 --> 23:07.593
Have you eaten anything?

23:10.138 --> 23:11.662
M&M's.

23:14.176 --> 23:15.837
Liv...

23:16.611 --> 23:19.808
Do you like it? Your job?

23:25.020 --> 23:28.649
Yeah, most days.

23:30.025 --> 23:32.892
Today, not so much.

23:33.662 --> 23:36.859
I followed a lead that didn't pan out.

23:37.399 --> 23:38.957
What about you? Why are you up?

23:40.735 --> 23:42.327
Um...

23:46.141 --> 23:47.802
I'm sorry.

23:48.477 --> 23:51.810
- Hello?
- We found our second victim.

23:51.980 --> 23:54.175
It's Kate Harper.

23:55.117 --> 23:58.416
- Where?
- Right outside St. Catherine's.

23:58.620 --> 24:00.053
Surrounded by candles.

24:00.222 --> 24:03.658
Good news is,
we might have finally caught a break.

24:03.825 --> 24:07.727
ERT said they found some blood
underneath her nails. They're running it.

24:07.896 --> 24:11.696
- Okay. I'll be right in.
- There's one more thing, Liv.

24:12.567 --> 24:15.161
The address the boy gave us...

24:15.871 --> 24:19.932
A little while after we left,
a neighbor found a dog tied to a fence.

24:20.142 --> 24:21.734
It was whimpering.

24:22.210 --> 24:25.577
- It was the victim's dog.
- We were there.

24:25.747 --> 24:27.647
There's no way
we could have known, Liv.

24:28.450 --> 24:32.250
But he was trying to tell us,
and he was right, and we were there?

24:40.695 --> 24:43.027
Walter, Olivia's here.
She needs to talk to you.

24:44.399 --> 24:46.230
- Walter.
- Could you come back later?

24:46.401 --> 24:47.766
I'm about to step in the bath.

24:47.936 --> 24:50.530
No, she can't come back.
It's the middle of the night.

24:50.705 --> 24:52.366
She needs to talk to you right now.

24:53.742 --> 24:57.769
Honestly, Peter, can't a man get a...?
Agent Dunham.

24:57.946 --> 25:00.107
Why didn't you tell me
Agent Dunham was here?

25:00.282 --> 25:04.981
- I'm pretty sure I did.
- Well, what can I do for you?

25:08.089 --> 25:10.319
Walter, it turns out
that the boy was right.

25:10.492 --> 25:13.586
He gave me a clue,
but I didn't know what I was looking for.

25:13.762 --> 25:17.892
Do you have any thoughts at all?
Any idea how I can reach him...

25:18.066 --> 25:22.594
...or how he's doing any of this?
- I believe I know how he's doing it.

25:22.771 --> 25:26.002
Since he's been living underground
for so long...

25:26.208 --> 25:28.574
...his hypersensitivity
to light and sound...

25:28.743 --> 25:32.076
It's just possible
he may also be sensitive...

25:32.247 --> 25:34.306
...to peoples' emotions.

25:34.482 --> 25:36.416
A raw nerve...

25:36.585 --> 25:40.282
...able to intuit the feelings
and intentions of others.

25:40.455 --> 25:43.322
- Your killer, for one.
- So are you saying that he's psychic?

25:43.491 --> 25:46.426
- No, no. More a shark.
- A shark?

25:46.595 --> 25:49.587
Specifically,
their electromagnetic field...

25:49.764 --> 25:53.097
...which allows them to detect
their prey's bioelectric field...

25:53.268 --> 25:54.860
...from a distance of many miles.

25:55.036 --> 25:58.267
We humans have it too,
of course. Pheromones.

25:58.440 --> 26:02.638
Undetectable chemicals
that nonetheless affect our behavior...

26:02.811 --> 26:05.837
...our sex drive, our fear...
- Hey, speaking of sex drive...

26:07.115 --> 26:09.140
Oh, Peter, don't be such a prude.

26:09.317 --> 26:12.445
I'm sure Agent Dunham
knows what a penis looks like.

26:12.621 --> 26:15.954
- Don't you, Agent Dunham?
- My father, ladies and gentlemen.

26:16.124 --> 26:18.115
But how would he know
things that I don't?

26:18.293 --> 26:21.729
Know about the killer or the victims
that he's never even met?

26:21.896 --> 26:25.855
My dear, there is much
that is unexplained...

26:26.034 --> 26:27.296
...until it is.

26:27.469 --> 26:29.801
In short, he has no idea.

26:29.971 --> 26:33.202
But even if you're right
and he can sense the killer...

26:33.375 --> 26:37.402
...he can't tell me that. Not in a way
that I could do anything about it.

26:37.579 --> 26:40.139
Well, if that's the problem,
then there's no problem.

26:40.315 --> 26:41.407
What does that mean?

26:42.083 --> 26:45.519
Well, the boy is obviously
thinking, yes? Having thoughts.

26:45.687 --> 26:48.349
We just haven't been able
to hear them.

26:48.523 --> 26:52.084
And I'm sure you can do that,
can't you? Hear his thoughts?

26:52.294 --> 26:54.489
Perhaps I can.

27:05.807 --> 27:07.866
Did you make that?

27:14.582 --> 27:15.947
Hey.

27:18.820 --> 27:22.415
Listen, I wanna take you
away from here for a while.

27:23.391 --> 27:25.120
Is that okay?

27:39.774 --> 27:43.039
Wile E. Coyote, super genius...

27:43.211 --> 27:46.305
- Vintage Bugs Bunny.
- Eh, what's up, doc?

27:46.481 --> 27:48.108
Didn't get any better than this, right?

27:48.283 --> 27:50.376
Being a genius has its advantages.

27:50.552 --> 27:52.076
Aha! I found it.

27:53.221 --> 27:55.416
Neural stimulator.

27:55.590 --> 27:57.490
Is there anything it can't do?

27:59.594 --> 28:02.085
Is that what you're gonna use
to read his thoughts?

28:02.263 --> 28:05.255
Not to read them, my dear.
To listen to them.

28:05.433 --> 28:07.799
- I wish you would've told us.
- Why?

28:07.969 --> 28:11.598
You could've saved us the hassle.
You're not putting that on that poor kid.

28:11.773 --> 28:15.766
The last time you used that thing,
you drilled it into the guy's head.

28:15.944 --> 28:20.005
If you think he'll find it disagreeable,
I suppose it could be modified.

28:20.181 --> 28:22.672
Really? Didn't think to mention that
to the last guy?

28:22.884 --> 28:26.320
It shouldn't be too much trouble.
I mean, we merely need to intercept...

28:26.488 --> 28:29.150
...the responses
from the speech centers of the brain...

28:29.324 --> 28:33.090
...which can be achieved by
placing electrodes in the halo ring.

28:33.261 --> 28:37.197
After that, it's simply a matter
of synthesizing the impulses.

28:37.399 --> 28:40.095
Think of it as creating
artificial vocal cords.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.432
Simple. Like making an omelet.

28:42.637 --> 28:47.131
Actually, son,
a good omelet is far more complex.

28:48.143 --> 28:50.839
We'll have him talking in no time.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.114
Where's the child
that was in this room?

29:01.289 --> 29:04.019
- He was discharged.
- By whom?

29:06.628 --> 29:10.155
Just remember that you don't have to do
anything that you don't wanna do.

29:10.331 --> 29:13.528
If for a second you're scared
or you don't like what's happening...

29:13.701 --> 29:16.966
...you just squeeze my hand
like that, okay?

29:17.372 --> 29:18.634
Is he ready?

29:20.542 --> 29:23.010
As ready as he'll ever be, I guess.

29:23.178 --> 29:24.805
I've seen that look before...

29:24.979 --> 29:27.174
...usually right before
somebody throws up.

29:28.316 --> 29:30.841
Agent Farnsworth, ready?

29:33.488 --> 29:38.016
- Walter, what are you doing?
- Watch and learn, son.

30:04.018 --> 30:06.077
Ooh! Whoo-hoo!

30:12.093 --> 30:14.687
Works every time.

30:29.010 --> 30:31.911
- Nicely done, Walter.
- Thank you.

30:33.281 --> 30:36.876
You can turn the music off now,
Agent Farnsworth.

30:45.226 --> 30:46.523
What's wrong?

30:52.600 --> 30:53.965
What's going on in here?

30:56.604 --> 30:59.767
Did you think you could steal a child
out of protective custody...

30:59.941 --> 31:01.499
...and that no one would notice?

31:01.676 --> 31:05.407
I didn't steal him. The child's
assisting us in a criminal investigation.

31:05.580 --> 31:06.740
Assisting you how?

31:07.849 --> 31:11.148
No offense, Mr. Michaels,
but that's classified information.

31:11.319 --> 31:15.278
The Department of Social Services
doesn't have clearance to know that.

31:19.661 --> 31:23.028
- What?
- Mr. Michaels isn't Social Services.

31:23.197 --> 31:26.325
He's with the CIA's Directorate
of Science and Technology.

31:26.501 --> 31:30.494
I'd have told you earlier myself, but
you don't have clearance to know that.

31:31.773 --> 31:35.209
We were informed the DS&T
would be taking full custody of the child.

31:35.376 --> 31:37.640
So they can what? Study him?

31:44.819 --> 31:48.311
This child was, apparently,
able to survive for years underground...

31:48.656 --> 31:51.853
...in an oxygen-deprived environment
with no food or water.

31:52.026 --> 31:55.462
Surely, you could see how someone
might wanna exploit that.

31:55.630 --> 31:59.566
So you wanna take him to protect him,
is that it? I don't buy that for a second.

31:59.734 --> 32:02.134
- Dunham.
- It's all right.

32:03.037 --> 32:06.529
It doesn't make any difference what
you think. The boy's coming with me.

32:06.708 --> 32:08.903
I'm afraid this is above both of us.

32:11.012 --> 32:12.809
Agent Francis just called.

32:12.981 --> 32:15.916
He said we got another invitation
from the Artist.

32:20.888 --> 32:24.324
Mr. Michaels,
suppose you gave us one day.

32:24.626 --> 32:25.684
A day?

32:25.860 --> 32:29.023
He can help us
catch a murderer and save a life.

32:29.197 --> 32:33.133
The boy will be under my protection.
I'll personally guarantee his safety.

32:37.872 --> 32:39.772
If I agree to this...

32:39.941 --> 32:42.569
...then you'll turn the boy over to me
without a fight.

32:44.712 --> 32:46.009
Do we have an agreement?

32:49.651 --> 32:51.243
We do.

33:11.906 --> 33:17.208
My very educated mother
just served us nine pies.

33:17.779 --> 33:21.545
No. That's the planets of
the solar system. Or at least, was.

33:21.716 --> 33:23.149
Wanna take a look at this?

33:23.317 --> 33:26.445
His name is Roadblock.
He's not one of your top-tier G.I. Joes...

33:26.621 --> 33:28.145
...but he was the best we had.

33:28.322 --> 33:29.812
- Wait, wait.
- Huh.

33:29.991 --> 33:33.392
It's funny. I always remember the scar
being on the other side.

33:33.561 --> 33:34.585
You want him?

33:34.762 --> 33:40.064
Cannot build phallic puzzles
in the lab. No.

33:40.234 --> 33:42.099
- What is he doing?
- Mnemonics.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.135
Like, a rhyme or phrase
to help memory.

33:44.305 --> 33:47.638
Like, HOMES stands
for the Great Lakes. That's Huron...

33:47.809 --> 33:50.778
I'm familiar with it.
Why is he doing it?

33:50.945 --> 33:54.608
He is trying to remember which wires go
into which connections on the machine.

33:56.484 --> 33:58.952
Yeah, thanks, Charlie. I will.
Keep me posted.

33:59.987 --> 34:02.285
- More bad news?
- We got the forensics report.

34:02.457 --> 34:05.790
We were hoping that the blood
under the second victim's fingernails...

34:05.960 --> 34:08.121
...was a match for the killer.
- But no?

34:08.295 --> 34:11.822
Not unless Gene is the killer.
It wasn't human, it was bovine.

34:11.998 --> 34:16.094
- You said cow blood?
- Yeah, and some plastic polymers.

34:16.270 --> 34:19.706
How would someone get cow's blood
on their fingers in Boston?

34:19.873 --> 34:23.105
Astrid, could you contact
the Bureau of Animal Health?

34:23.277 --> 34:25.802
Start pulling livestock licenses
around Boston.

34:25.980 --> 34:29.143
Petting farms,
research facilities, anything.

34:29.317 --> 34:31.978
- Yeah, got you.
- She's a bad mama jama. Ha.

34:32.186 --> 34:36.554
Alpha, beta, theta and gamma.
She's a bad mama jama.

34:36.757 --> 34:40.455
Signal, amplification, bifurcation,
modulation, juxtaposition.

34:40.628 --> 34:41.993
You hanging in there, kiddo?

34:42.163 --> 34:44.996
Translating motor-linguistic
impulses into language!

34:45.166 --> 34:48.397
- Yeah, me too.
- Peter, get me the red wires.

34:49.203 --> 34:52.502
- Peter?
- Here's a thought.

34:53.206 --> 34:56.904
Couple years ago, I was working as
a floor sweeper at a meat-packing plant.

34:57.078 --> 34:59.911
- Sounds awesome.
- You have no idea.

35:00.081 --> 35:04.484
My point is, we had these
big rolls of industrial-grade plastic...

35:04.652 --> 35:08.179
...to wrap their meat in before we would
send them to the grocery stores.

35:08.356 --> 35:10.722
- Cow's blood and plastic.
- Yeah.

35:37.618 --> 35:39.051
Okay.

35:39.220 --> 35:41.347
I believe we're ready.

35:41.522 --> 35:43.387
- Peter.
- Yeah.

35:50.898 --> 35:52.195
Yes.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.095
Listen to that.

35:54.268 --> 35:56.259
Listen to what?
That's just random noise.

35:56.437 --> 36:00.533
No, that's just the computer
calibrating the signal-to-noise ratio.

36:00.708 --> 36:04.735
Adjust the attenuator setting
to 70 decibels.

36:09.217 --> 36:11.082
That sounds a little more like a voice.

36:11.252 --> 36:14.380
Yes. And now
the sound-pressure level.

36:14.555 --> 36:18.787
Dial the audio meter to 1500 hertz.

36:18.960 --> 36:21.554
- Go slower.
- If you wanna do this yourself, feel free.

36:21.729 --> 36:22.991
There.

36:25.166 --> 36:29.262
Astrid, quickly.
Get me a tape recorder.

36:39.180 --> 36:40.772
Turn the machine off right now.

36:40.948 --> 36:43.508
Turn it off. He's freezing.
Help me get this off him.

36:43.684 --> 36:46.585
Hey, Astrid, can you grab us a blanket?
Free in the front.

36:46.754 --> 36:48.187
Here.

36:49.390 --> 36:53.087
- We're gonna get you warmed up.
- Doesn't make any sense.

36:53.261 --> 36:55.991
If anything,
brain activity should generate heat.

36:56.163 --> 36:59.826
We're trying to track down
a suspect in a murder investigation.

37:00.635 --> 37:03.661
What, you mean the guy in the news
who killed those girls?

37:03.838 --> 37:05.271
We're not sure. Maybe.

37:05.439 --> 37:08.135
But any past or present employees
that stick out to you?

37:08.309 --> 37:12.268
Like, antisocial behavior or a history
of violent incidences here at work?

37:12.446 --> 37:15.609
No. They're good men. Hard workers.

37:15.783 --> 37:18.445
Well, I'm gonna need a copy
of your employee records.

37:18.619 --> 37:22.680
- Okay.
- And a sample of your shipping plastic.

37:22.857 --> 37:24.722
Plastic? Why?

37:25.126 --> 37:27.424
It could be an element
in our investigation.

37:29.463 --> 37:33.229
- Will that be a problem?
- No, but...

37:33.434 --> 37:34.560
Mr. Wu?

37:36.671 --> 37:39.367
A man came in here yesterday...

37:39.540 --> 37:42.509
...and I sold him some plastic.

37:52.586 --> 37:53.814
Allow me.

37:53.988 --> 37:59.392
Oh, thank you.
Your mother raised you well.

38:01.762 --> 38:03.821
Hey, Peter, it's me. I'm just leaving.

38:03.998 --> 38:06.694
So how's the boy?
Has Walter made any progress?

38:06.867 --> 38:08.562
Hard to say. We heard something...

38:08.736 --> 38:11.227
...but I don't know
if it was the kid trying to talk.

38:11.405 --> 38:14.397
I don't want you to get upset
about this, because he is fine...

38:14.575 --> 38:16.702
...but something kind of weird
did happen.

38:16.877 --> 38:19.345
- Weird how?
- He started shivering all of a sudden.

38:19.513 --> 38:21.504
Like the temperature dropped.
It didn't.

38:21.682 --> 38:23.513
- Is he sick?
- No, he seems fine.

38:23.684 --> 38:27.120
We got him wrapped up in a blanket.
He's doing okay. You find anything?

38:27.288 --> 38:30.917
Yeah. Looks like the Artist bought
some plastic from a slaughterhouse.

38:31.092 --> 38:32.923
I got a sketch, all thanks to you.

38:33.527 --> 38:36.087
- Hey, guys, we got good news.
- What's that?

38:36.263 --> 38:39.790
The plastic did come from a
meat-packing plant. Olivia got a sketch.

38:40.001 --> 38:41.935
What about you?
Gonna go back to the FBI?

38:42.103 --> 38:44.571
- Ask her if it was refrigerated.
- Hold on a second.

38:44.739 --> 38:46.570
Ask her if the plant was refrigerated.

38:46.741 --> 38:49.266
It's a meat-packing plant.
Let's go out on a limb...

38:49.443 --> 38:52.139
...and say that it's refrigerated.
What does that matter?

38:52.313 --> 38:54.975
Because that explains everything.

38:55.149 --> 38:56.946
Walter, you're not making any sense.

38:57.118 --> 38:58.142
Of course I am.

38:58.319 --> 39:02.221
The boy, our strange little friend,
is an empath.

39:02.390 --> 39:05.086
He senses other people's
emotions. You already said that.

39:05.259 --> 39:06.385
Did I?

39:06.560 --> 39:08.289
Go on, Walter. What are you saying?

39:08.462 --> 39:11.454
That he's capable of making
connections. Emotional connections.

39:11.632 --> 39:15.568
To a construction worker who found
him, the killer, but most importantly...

39:15.736 --> 39:19.263
...he's emotionally bonded to you,
Agent Dunham.

39:21.442 --> 39:24.969
That's why he's telling you
about the crimes.

39:25.146 --> 39:29.549
Because he knows that
the information is important to you.

39:29.817 --> 39:32.115
He's trying to help you.

39:56.577 --> 39:58.442
Are you trying to help me?

40:16.864 --> 40:20.061
That man who's been hurting people
is going to hurt someone else...

40:20.234 --> 40:22.498
...unless I stop him.

40:23.737 --> 40:25.204
Do you know who he is?

40:26.340 --> 40:29.002
Can you tell me anything about him?

40:30.377 --> 40:32.140
Maybe he doesn't know.

40:32.313 --> 40:35.476
Or he can't control the ability
all the time.

40:36.217 --> 40:40.176
Perhaps a small electric shock
to kick-start things.

40:42.022 --> 40:43.046
No.

40:44.825 --> 40:47.123
It's something different.

40:48.762 --> 40:50.525
It's like he's mad at me.

40:51.565 --> 40:54.762
- Because he doesn't wanna leave.
- What?

40:54.935 --> 40:58.063
You told Michaels that once the boy
helped you stop the Artist...

40:58.239 --> 41:00.264
...you'd turn him over to him.

41:00.441 --> 41:02.068
He heard you.

41:02.409 --> 41:04.900
Or more accurately, felt you.

41:14.421 --> 41:15.547
I'm sorry.

41:15.723 --> 41:17.714
I've been so caught up
in what I needed...

41:17.892 --> 41:22.920
...that I forgot how strange
this must seem to you.

41:23.097 --> 41:27.056
And I know how scared you must be,
but I need your help again.

41:27.234 --> 41:30.465
I can't even stop them
from taking you...

41:31.872 --> 41:34.432
...even though I wish I could.

41:37.211 --> 41:40.578
And if you really can feel
what I'm thinking...

41:43.484 --> 41:45.782
...you know how much I mean that.

42:12.313 --> 42:14.008
Thank you.

42:26.527 --> 42:29.928
Nice car, sir. Where you headed?

42:30.097 --> 42:34.158
- Home. I was out to dinner.
- Open the trunk, please.

42:37.338 --> 42:39.169
It's clear.

42:40.874 --> 42:44.503
Okay, thank you.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.678
What's going on, officer?

42:50.851 --> 42:52.682
What are you doing
in the neighborhood?

42:52.853 --> 42:57.483
I... Just coming home from work.
Haven't had anything to drink.

43:00.527 --> 43:02.995
Look, do you mind if I ask
what you're looking for?

43:03.163 --> 43:05.154
I'm sorry. We're not allowed to say.

43:18.879 --> 43:22.007
Sir, we need to check
the back of your vehicle.

43:35.796 --> 43:37.661
Charlie, check the back of the van.

43:55.916 --> 43:58.612
Liv, it's him.

43:58.819 --> 44:01.253
We found a victim. She's alive.

44:39.226 --> 44:41.285
- You all right?
- Yeah.

44:45.799 --> 44:46.857
Oh, God.

44:49.269 --> 44:51.897
This is Francis.
We need EMS at the cemetery...

44:52.072 --> 44:54.939
...behind the 1600 block of York.

44:59.947 --> 45:02.347
- Broyles.
- It's Olivia.

45:02.516 --> 45:04.780
I need you to help me with something.

45:13.160 --> 45:15.993
Here. And then we just do
the blood work, okay?

45:16.163 --> 45:17.790
Okay.

45:17.965 --> 45:20.263
- Excuse me, Dr. Winick?
- Yes.

45:20.434 --> 45:22.925
I was wondering
if I could talk to you for a moment.

45:23.103 --> 45:24.764
Sure.

45:28.442 --> 45:30.034
Hi.

45:31.011 --> 45:34.845
Hi. I think you'll find
he's doing much better.

45:35.983 --> 45:39.146
Hi. Oh, thank you.

45:41.155 --> 45:43.487
You remember Dr. Winick.

45:49.530 --> 45:52.658
She's gonna take you now,
but not to a facility.

45:52.833 --> 45:55.165
She's going to take you to a home...

45:55.335 --> 45:58.236
...with a very nice family
that are gonna take care of you...

45:58.939 --> 46:00.998
...and keep you safe.

46:05.579 --> 46:06.876
We should go now.

46:09.583 --> 46:11.175
Ah...

46:25.966 --> 46:27.490
Bye.

46:55.295 --> 46:57.058
What do you mean, he's gone?

46:57.231 --> 46:59.222
I'm sorry, Mr. Michaels.

46:59.566 --> 47:03.764
- Gone where?
- That's what we can't figure out.

47:03.937 --> 47:07.429
He disappeared from right
under the noses of a protective detail.

47:07.608 --> 47:12.068
- How's that possible? He's just a kid.
- Yes.

47:12.246 --> 47:15.113
A kid who, as you said,
lived his entire life underground...

47:15.282 --> 47:18.740
...which still begs the question
how he got there in the first place.

47:20.554 --> 47:25.048
I'm beginning to suspect there's a lot
about him we don't understand...

47:25.225 --> 47:26.954
...and apparently, we never will.

47:41.174 --> 47:45.440
- No, I didn't! I didn't say it!
- Yes, you did.

47:46.914 --> 47:48.677
- Hi, Liv.
- Yeah.

47:48.849 --> 47:52.785
Mommy is so bad at Simon Says.
She won't even do what I say.

47:52.953 --> 47:55.012
Four years old,
and she's drunk with power.

47:55.188 --> 47:57.952
I have created a monster!

47:58.125 --> 48:01.583
- Do you wanna play with us?
- Oh, don't do that. Let Aunt Liv rest.

48:01.762 --> 48:02.786
Sure.

48:04.698 --> 48:06.825
- I'm Simon.
- Okay.

48:07.000 --> 48:09.696
- Simon says, "Put your hands in the air."
- Okay.

48:09.870 --> 48:11.462
Touch your nose.

48:13.340 --> 48:14.830
You lost.

48:15.008 --> 48:19.001
- Okay. Again, again.
- Simon says, "Touch your nose."

48:19.179 --> 48:22.080
You lose again!
