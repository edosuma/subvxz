00:01.134 --> 00:04.102
Does everybody know
what time it is?
<i>Tool time!</i>

00:04.103 --> 00:06.037
That's right. Binford tools
is proud to present

00:06.038 --> 00:08.273
Tim "the tool man" taylor.
Whoo-hoo!

00:08.274 --> 00:10.042
<i>(applause)</i>

00:16.181 --> 00:17.883
Thank you.

00:17.884 --> 00:19.651
Thank you, heidi.

00:19.652 --> 00:22.521
Thank you, everybody.
Welcome to <i>tool time.</i>

00:22.522 --> 00:24.756
I am tim "the tool man" taylor,

00:24.757 --> 00:29.360
And you all know my assistant
al "next time light a match"
borland.

00:29.361 --> 00:33.431
Today we're introducing
a brand-new segment
right here on <i>tool time.</i>

00:33.432 --> 00:37.068
That's right, it's called
"the unsung heroes
of the job site."

00:37.069 --> 00:40.271
<i>(men singing)</i>
<i>♪ he gets no thanks,</i>
<i>and that ain't right</i>

00:40.272 --> 00:43.608
<i>♪ he's an unsung hero</i>
<i>of the job site ♪</i>

00:48.281 --> 00:50.282
When people think
about construction,

00:50.283 --> 00:53.785
They always think
about the glory jobs.

00:53.786 --> 00:56.854
Yeah, your dry wallers,
your backhoers,
your trench diggers.

00:56.855 --> 01:00.024
What about the guys
that work hard
that don't get any glory?

01:00.025 --> 01:02.060
Yeah. What about us?

01:02.061 --> 01:06.130
I said "unsung heroes,"
not "unsung zeroes."

01:07.500 --> 01:10.301
Today we're gonna meet the man
who services these bad boys.

01:10.302 --> 01:14.005
If you think your job stinks,
wait till you meet this guy.

01:14.006 --> 01:16.107
Premier porta-potti pumper
frank dugan.

01:16.108 --> 01:17.575
Come on out, frank.

01:17.576 --> 01:19.677
<i>(applause)</i>

01:23.682 --> 01:28.420
How you doin', tim?

01:28.421 --> 01:32.957
I get that a lot,
you know.
Aw, man. Aw, thanks.

01:32.958 --> 01:35.226
Frank, how did you get
in the porta-potti business?

01:35.227 --> 01:38.362
Well, you know,
I just kind of fell into it.

01:40.366 --> 01:42.734
Wanna tell us how
you keep these maintained?

01:42.735 --> 01:44.235
You betcha, al.

01:44.236 --> 01:47.706
You know, what I got is,
I got me a big old
20-foot suction hose,

01:47.707 --> 01:50.341
And I got that sucker
hooked up to my pumper truck,

01:50.342 --> 01:53.011
And on the back
I got an 800-gallon tank.

01:53.012 --> 01:54.179
800?
Yeah.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.681
<i>(grunts)</i>

01:56.682 --> 02:00.919
You got it made, boy.
Good job, huge hose
and a big truck.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.320
Well, that's true, tim,

02:02.321 --> 02:06.123
But, you know,
there's one thing
I don't get.

02:06.124 --> 02:07.992
Respect.

02:07.993 --> 02:11.196
People walk up
to one of these porta-potties,
and they look at it,

02:11.197 --> 02:15.933
And they stand there
and they say, "I'll wait."

02:20.873 --> 02:23.275
That's gotta hurt, too.

02:23.276 --> 02:25.376
I like porta-potties.
I like these things.

02:25.377 --> 02:28.213
I wish I had one
next to my couch
in the living room.

02:28.214 --> 02:32.117
During football season,
I'd never have to leave
the room.

02:32.118 --> 02:35.554
'course, everyone else would.

02:35.555 --> 02:39.323
Why don't you tell us
all about this 35-gallon
polyurethane bad boy?

02:39.324 --> 02:41.759
Oh, you bet.

02:41.760 --> 02:46.664
Well, tim, as you can see,
it's very spacious,
totally clean.

02:46.665 --> 02:49.968
It will accommodate
either one of your sexes.

02:49.969 --> 02:53.538
Most importantly of all,
perfectly private.

02:56.208 --> 02:59.343
There's a man
who takes pride in his work,
glorifies his job.

02:59.344 --> 03:02.113
Truly the unsung hero
of the job site.

03:02.114 --> 03:05.683
Come on out and show us
how you move these
job site to job site.

03:05.684 --> 03:10.221
Frank?
Uh, tim, it's gonna be
about another minute.

03:16.495 --> 03:19.464

Hey, mom. Hey, dad.
Hey, brad.

04:17.856 --> 04:20.357
You were supposed
to be back from school
an hour ago.

04:20.358 --> 04:23.795
I stayed late.
I just wanted to soak up
some extra knowledge.

04:26.899 --> 04:29.901
By any chance,
were you soaking up
that extra knowledge

04:29.902 --> 04:31.536
In detention?

04:31.537 --> 04:35.173
Hey, knowledge
is knowledge.

04:35.174 --> 04:37.175
I can't believe you, brad.

04:37.176 --> 04:40.244
It's not that big a deal.
I've had detention before.

04:40.245 --> 04:42.646
It's the first day
of school!

04:44.850 --> 04:48.320
No one ever gets detention
on the first day of school.

04:48.321 --> 04:50.688
I wouldn't say no one.

04:51.756 --> 04:53.458
What did you do?

04:53.459 --> 04:55.693
Nothing! Bruce tyler
was throwing spit wads at me.

04:55.694 --> 04:57.662
I had to do something.

04:57.663 --> 05:00.531
I meant brad.
What did you do
to get detention?

05:00.532 --> 05:01.800
Nothing.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.601
So this is one of those

05:03.602 --> 05:07.438
"come and get to know
the other delinquents"
sort of thing?

05:07.439 --> 05:11.009
Look, I told you, ok?
I didn't do anything.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.777
You believe that?

05:12.778 --> 05:14.178
It's terrible.

05:14.179 --> 05:17.916
Teachers are still
giving detention for nothing.

05:17.917 --> 05:19.951
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

05:21.387 --> 05:23.254
Hi!
Oh, hi, al.

05:23.255 --> 05:24.989
Sorry to barge in on you.

05:24.990 --> 05:28.093
I've been trying
to call for two hours.
The phone's busy.

05:28.094 --> 05:30.395
Randy, get off the phone.

05:30.396 --> 05:34.732
So did you hear the news?
Binford has officially
been sold.

05:34.733 --> 05:36.834
All right.
Who was the mystery buyer?

05:36.835 --> 05:40.037
Some guy by the name
of bud harper.

05:40.038 --> 05:42.207
Why do I know that name?

05:42.208 --> 05:44.843
When I was working
at the magazine, we did
a cover story on him.

05:44.844 --> 05:47.112
No, I never read
the magazine.

05:47.113 --> 05:49.814
He owns that chain
of tire stores,

05:49.815 --> 05:52.517
A software company,
the commuter airline.

05:52.518 --> 05:55.887
That's right. Wait a minute,
this guy's got a lot of money.
That could help <i>tool time.</i>

05:55.888 --> 05:58.390
Or it could be
the worst thing to happen.

05:58.391 --> 06:01.893
You know how these big
conglomerate guys work.
They're ruthless.

06:01.894 --> 06:05.430
They come in,
they cut out all the fat.
No wonder you're worried.

06:07.099 --> 06:10.101
They already
fired the president.
What if we're next?

06:10.102 --> 06:13.104
What if they fire us?
What if they get rid
of <i>tool time?</i>

06:13.105 --> 06:16.374
Would you quit spitting
on the back of my neck?
Well?

06:16.375 --> 06:18.910
They're not gonna
get rid of <i>tool time.</i>

06:18.911 --> 06:21.413
We're the crown jewel
of the binford empire.

06:21.414 --> 06:25.216
The crown jewel? I had no idea
I was married to royalty.

06:25.217 --> 06:28.653
Well, you know it now.

06:28.654 --> 06:31.222
<i>(phone rings)</i>

06:31.223 --> 06:34.426
Hello.
Yeah, just a minute please.

06:34.427 --> 06:37.962
Your highness.
Bud harper's office
calling.

06:37.963 --> 06:41.098
Oh, no. It's always worse
when they call you at home.

06:41.099 --> 06:42.400
Al.

06:42.401 --> 06:44.402
It's over. We're history.
Sayonara!

06:44.403 --> 06:46.237
Al, chill.

06:46.238 --> 06:47.738
Yes. Uh-huh.

06:47.739 --> 06:50.941
Sure, breakfast would be fine.
I get up pretty -

06:50.942 --> 06:53.044
He wants to have breakfast
at 6am?

06:53.045 --> 06:55.846
Sure, I'll just move my lunch
to 9:30.

06:57.817 --> 07:00.117
Yes, I know where it is.
I'll be there.

07:00.118 --> 07:02.286
Thank you very much.
Goodbye.

07:02.287 --> 07:05.155
Have a little breakfast meeting
with bud harper. No problem.

07:05.156 --> 07:06.657
Thank goodness.

07:06.658 --> 07:09.327
A guy doesn't take you
out to breakfast
to fire you.

07:09.328 --> 07:11.495
Actually,
sometimes he does.
<i>(both)</i> huh?

07:11.496 --> 07:16.034
Oh, I knew breakfast
was a bad idea!

07:16.035 --> 07:18.202
It's not always bad.
It depends on what he orders.

07:18.203 --> 07:20.004
If he orders breakfast,
you're fine.

07:20.005 --> 07:23.808
If he just orders coffee,
he wants to get out fast,
and you're history.

07:23.809 --> 07:27.478
Where did you come up
with that theory?

07:27.479 --> 07:31.249
When I worked
as a cashier in high school,
I got fired over coffee.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.250
When I was fired
from the bookstore, coffee.

07:33.251 --> 07:35.553
When I was fired
from the diner,
coffee to go.

07:37.489 --> 07:39.724
Have you ever kept a job?

07:51.503 --> 07:54.404
There's gotta be
a way out of this thing.

07:58.677 --> 08:00.478
Tim?
What?!

08:00.479 --> 08:02.313
Bud harper.
Oh, bud harper.

08:02.314 --> 08:04.949
Good to see you.
Good to see you.

08:04.950 --> 08:08.553
Heard a lot about you.
Thank you. Sit down.
Sorry I'm late.

08:08.554 --> 08:11.121
That's ok.
I was working.
What can I get you guys?

08:11.122 --> 08:14.959
Big breakfast.
Have a big one,
a big breakfast.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.728
Eggs and pancakes, toast,
some breakfast meats -

08:17.729 --> 08:20.397
The whole left side
of the menu. Same for you?

08:20.398 --> 08:22.901
Oh, no, no.
Just coffee for me.

08:22.902 --> 08:25.670
Oh, no. Oh, no.
You gotta have breakfast.

08:25.671 --> 08:28.139
It is the foundation meal
of the whole day.

08:28.140 --> 08:29.774
Just coffee.

08:29.775 --> 08:31.542
A lot of coffee.

08:31.543 --> 08:34.078
Bring a whole bunch
of coffee.

08:34.078 --> 08:37.715
Uh, now, tim,
I need to talk to you
about your show.

08:37.716 --> 08:39.817
I had my people
study the ratings,

08:39.818 --> 08:41.953
And I don't like
what they told me.

08:41.953 --> 08:43.754
Can I call you bud?
Absolutely.

08:43.755 --> 08:46.290
You shouldn't listen
to what your people say.

08:46.291 --> 08:48.826
My people give me
the wrong information
all the time.

08:48.827 --> 08:52.563
According to my people,
you don't have people.

08:53.966 --> 08:56.633
Thank you.

08:56.634 --> 09:01.605
Now, uh, tim,
I'm not gonna blow a lot
of sunshine up your butt.

09:03.976 --> 09:08.179
Good, 'cause it sounds
like it might be
kind of painful.

09:08.180 --> 09:10.814
I've always loved
binford tools.

09:10.815 --> 09:12.283
Yeah?
Yeah.

09:12.284 --> 09:14.785
I think <i>tool time</i>
is a great show.

09:14.786 --> 09:16.187
You do?
That's right.

09:16.188 --> 09:18.689
Together we can break
out of the local market

09:18.690 --> 09:20.692
And take this show
national.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.194
You mean, like,
all over michigan?

09:24.663 --> 09:27.599
No, no, no, no.
Like, all over the country.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.702
I plan to sink major dollars
into this show, build new sets.

09:30.703 --> 09:33.037
We'll start out
at ten new markets...
Yes!

09:33.038 --> 09:35.206
...And as the show
becomes more profitable,

09:35.207 --> 09:37.475
Your salary
will be commensurate.

09:37.476 --> 09:40.511
Oh, boy.

09:40.512 --> 09:43.181
There's always a catch,
isn't there?

09:43.182 --> 09:44.983
You'll make more money.

09:44.984 --> 09:48.586
Oh, that commensurate.
Yeah!

09:50.222 --> 09:53.424
Now...

09:53.425 --> 09:57.395
Tim, there's an aspect
of <i>tool time</i> I need
to talk to you about.

09:57.396 --> 10:00.398
Shoot.
Well, when I was watching
the show,

10:00.399 --> 10:02.967
There was one thing
that, I don't know,

10:02.968 --> 10:04.969
Just rubbed me
the wrong way.

10:04.970 --> 10:08.439
Ah, yeah. You didn't like
our salute to lubricants.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.808
Oh, lubricants?
No, no. Lubricants
is great television.

10:10.809 --> 10:13.777
No, I'm talking
about something I feel

10:13.778 --> 10:17.148
Is keeping the show
from really taking off.

10:17.149 --> 10:20.718
Gadget corner.
We can dump it.
I don't like it.

10:20.719 --> 10:22.987
Oh, no.
I love gadget corner.

10:22.988 --> 10:26.958
Yeah...
So do I. I love that.
That's good, too.

10:26.959 --> 10:30.762
No, no, no, I'm...
I'm talking about al.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.196
What about al?

10:32.197 --> 10:35.266
I know you guys
have been together
a long time, and I -

10:35.267 --> 10:36.901
Six years?
Yeah.

10:36.902 --> 10:38.268
Oh, well, good.

10:38.269 --> 10:41.305
Well... I'm gonna put this
as delicately as possible.

10:41.306 --> 10:43.107
Go ahead.

10:43.108 --> 10:44.909
You gotta dump him.

10:50.348 --> 10:54.251
Bud, I-I can't do <i>tool time</i>
without al.

10:54.252 --> 10:56.987
Everybody loves al.
Oh, no, no, no,
not everybody.

10:56.988 --> 10:59.056
Now, we did
some audience testing,

10:59.057 --> 11:02.159
And the numbers show
that al is a big dud
with the younger viewers.

11:02.160 --> 11:04.896
I don't put much stock
in audience testing.

11:04.897 --> 11:06.631
Well, now, you tested
through the roof.

11:06.632 --> 11:09.967
On the other hand,
it's quite a valuable tool.

11:09.968 --> 11:12.169
Oh, audiences love you.

11:12.170 --> 11:15.206
Of course, they don't love you
as much as they love heidi.

11:15.207 --> 11:16.707
Yeah, that's funny.

11:16.708 --> 11:19.444
You're not kidding?
Heidi tested better than me?

11:19.445 --> 11:22.013
Heidi tested better
than santa claus.

11:22.014 --> 11:26.150
Ok, here are
your egg dishes.
Oh, it's great, dolores.

11:26.151 --> 11:28.753
Your hot cereals
and breakfast meats
will be out in a minute.

11:28.754 --> 11:31.522
I'm really adamant
about this with al.
I have to -

11:31.523 --> 11:35.092
Your get your choice
of bacon, ham or sausage.
Sausage. The reason...

11:35.093 --> 11:37.495
Links or patties?
I'll take the links,
please.

11:37.496 --> 11:40.197
Mild or spicy?
Just surprise me!

11:46.772 --> 11:49.273
I don't care much
about your testing, really,

11:49.274 --> 11:52.643
Because al is a big hit
with the seniors, ok?

11:52.644 --> 11:55.446
You go to any
early-bird special
in this city,

11:55.447 --> 11:58.116
You can hear people talking
about al borland.

11:58.117 --> 11:59.951
Yeah, but that's the problem.

11:59.952 --> 12:02.954
The senior crowd has already
bought their tools.

12:02.955 --> 12:04.989
We need new viewers
who are hip,

12:04.990 --> 12:07.859
Not viewers
who need a new hip.

12:11.396 --> 12:14.498
I... I've been together
with al for six years,
though.

12:14.499 --> 12:18.435
Ok, you've got 14 plates
of potatoes coming.

12:18.436 --> 12:21.105
That's...
That's just great, dolores.

12:21.106 --> 12:24.875
Ok, I've got hash browns,
home fries or o'briens.

12:24.876 --> 12:27.878
Am I your only customer?

12:27.879 --> 12:30.014
No, but you're my favorite.

12:33.118 --> 12:34.618
Tim, listen to me.

12:34.619 --> 12:37.121
I'm giving you
the chance of a lifetime.

12:37.122 --> 12:39.824
You can make a lot more money
and be a star.

12:39.825 --> 12:44.061
Look, I want you to go
toe-to-toe with bob vila
and crush him like a bug.

12:44.062 --> 12:46.597
Crush him like a bug.
More coffee!
Yeah.

12:48.333 --> 12:51.335
You like that, don't you?
Yeah, crush him
like a bug.

12:51.336 --> 12:52.803
Yeah.
Yeah!

12:52.804 --> 12:55.640
Then you know
what you gotta do?
Yeah! What?

12:55.641 --> 12:58.943
Fire al.
You want me to fire al?

12:58.944 --> 13:01.912
Well, I can't do it.
My grandmother loves al.

13:03.748 --> 13:06.017
Brad,
what's detention like?

13:06.018 --> 13:09.520
It's a drag.
They sit you in a room,
then they yell at you,

13:09.521 --> 13:12.356
And finally,
they make you
do your homework.

13:12.357 --> 13:15.459
It's just like being at home.

13:16.795 --> 13:19.596
Except I can't get you
to do your homework.

13:19.597 --> 13:22.766
Neither could they.
That's why brad will be
a little late today, too.

13:22.767 --> 13:24.768
Would you shut up?

13:24.769 --> 13:27.538
You got detention
in detention?

13:27.539 --> 13:29.540
Yeah, but it wasn't
my fault.

13:29.541 --> 13:31.309
It's never your fault.

13:31.310 --> 13:33.244
Hey, thanks
for understanding.

13:34.546 --> 13:36.813
We're gonna
talk about this later!

13:36.814 --> 13:40.318
You better not get
any more detention!

13:40.319 --> 13:42.820
<i>(♪ flute)</i>

13:44.355 --> 13:45.756
Hey, wilson.

13:45.757 --> 13:48.693
Well, hi-de-ho,
neighborette.

13:48.694 --> 13:51.696
How'd you like
an obnoxious teenaged son
for the next few years?

13:51.697 --> 13:53.731
It wouldn't be first
on my wish list.

13:53.732 --> 13:56.366
It's not first on mine, either,
but I don't have a choice.

13:56.367 --> 13:58.703
And I got two more
hot on his heels.

13:58.704 --> 14:01.706
<i>(chuckles)</i>
well, brad is a good kid.
I'm sure it's just a phase.

14:01.707 --> 14:03.708
I hope so.
He's driving me crazy.

14:03.709 --> 14:05.710
It's the first day
of high school,

14:05.711 --> 14:07.712
And he's mouthing off
and getting in trouble.

14:07.713 --> 14:10.481
Ah, mm-hmm,
mm-hmm, mm-hmm. Hmm.

14:11.617 --> 14:14.585
What happened
to my sweet little boy?

14:14.586 --> 14:16.553
Jill, if it's any consolation
to you,

14:16.554 --> 14:18.555
I myself
was quite the rapscallion

14:18.556 --> 14:20.424
When I was brad's age.

14:20.425 --> 14:22.793
That's hard to believe.

14:22.794 --> 14:25.629
Oh, yes, indeedy.
I was a holy terror.

14:25.630 --> 14:27.698
What could you
possibly have done?

14:27.699 --> 14:31.168
Well, I'm afraid to admit it,
but when I was in high school,

14:31.169 --> 14:34.038
I was playing chess
with my father,

14:34.039 --> 14:36.774
And he had me
hopelessly cornered,

14:36.775 --> 14:39.744
And I, being
the incorrigible rebel,

14:39.745 --> 14:43.413
Refused to concede defeat.

14:47.753 --> 14:51.155
And I thought brad was bad.

14:51.156 --> 14:52.990
It gets worse.

14:52.991 --> 14:55.493
So for punishment,
he sent me up to my room,

14:55.494 --> 14:58.796
And instead,
I snuck out a window,
crossed the state line

14:58.797 --> 15:02.366
And went to a monet exhibit.

15:02.367 --> 15:04.568
You were a wild one.

15:04.569 --> 15:08.272
Oh, yes, I was.
And look how normal
I turned out.

15:15.113 --> 15:18.682
Hi, honey.
Hi. What's in the bags?

15:18.683 --> 15:23.887
Oh, about 300
different kinds of sausage.

15:23.888 --> 15:26.223
800 pounds of potatoes.

15:26.224 --> 15:28.258
What happened
with bud harper?

15:28.259 --> 15:32.964
Well, he'd like to sink
more money into the show
and take <i>tool time</i> national.

15:32.965 --> 15:38.269
What? National?
That's terrific!

15:38.270 --> 15:41.905
That's going to be great
for you and al.
Well...

15:41.906 --> 15:44.908
It's going to be
a lot greater for me
than it will be for al.

15:44.909 --> 15:46.910
What do you mean by that?

15:46.911 --> 15:49.447
If we make
the move to national,
I'll make more money,

15:49.448 --> 15:53.451
And al will make,
before taxes... Nothing.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.287
He's going to fire al?

15:56.288 --> 15:58.756
No, no, no.
He wants me to fire al.

15:58.757 --> 16:02.760
That's terrible.
I can't believe they'd
put you in that position.

16:02.761 --> 16:04.561
Me neither.
I can't fire al.

16:04.562 --> 16:07.064
Of course you can't.

16:07.065 --> 16:09.966
If I don't fire al,
they're not gonna put money
into <i>tool time,</i>

16:09.967 --> 16:13.003
And there goes my dream -
taking the show national,
making more money,

16:13.004 --> 16:15.272
Buying that vacation home
we've been thinking about.

16:15.273 --> 16:18.943
The one on the lake
with the screened-in porch
all the way around.

16:18.944 --> 16:21.645
10,000-square foot garage.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.852
Tell me why
I'm giving this up again.

16:27.853 --> 16:30.221
'cause it's
the right thing to do.

16:30.222 --> 16:33.257
What else you got?
Tim.

16:33.258 --> 16:36.761
This is an opportunity
of a lifetime.

16:36.762 --> 16:39.296
Don't I owe it to myself
just to consider it?

16:39.297 --> 16:41.465
I mean, al is
a good friend of mine,

16:41.466 --> 16:43.667
But how loyal
do I have to be?

16:43.668 --> 16:45.702
Depends on how good
a friend you are.

16:45.703 --> 16:48.739
Look at it this way.
Maybe by firing al,
it would help his career.

16:48.740 --> 16:50.674
How do you figure that?

16:50.675 --> 16:52.576
When bob vila
and norm broke up,

16:52.577 --> 16:54.578
No one thought norm
would do anything.

16:54.579 --> 16:57.514
Now he's got
that whittling thing
on channel 15.

16:57.515 --> 17:00.351
Al would be devastated.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.353
<i>Tool time</i> is everything
to him.

17:02.354 --> 17:06.290
That's sick. What kind of guy
dedicates his whole life
to a local cable show?

17:06.290 --> 17:08.159
Hello.

17:08.160 --> 17:09.359
Hello!

17:09.361 --> 17:11.362
Hey, al.
Look, it's al.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.196
So, how did
breakfast go?

17:13.198 --> 17:15.499
Is the rumor true?
What rumor is that, al?

17:15.500 --> 17:18.902
Well, heidi heard
that harper wants to
take the show national.

17:18.903 --> 17:21.438
He might have
mentioned something
about going national.

17:21.439 --> 17:23.440
That is our dream
come true!

17:23.441 --> 17:25.942
Dreams die, al.
What are you
talking about?

17:25.943 --> 17:28.444
I told him
I wasn't interested.
Why would you say that?

17:28.445 --> 17:31.448
I don't know. I thought
it was the right thing to do,

17:31.449 --> 17:33.950
And I don't want
to talk about it.

17:33.951 --> 17:37.888
How could you possibly make
a decision like that

17:37.889 --> 17:40.391
Without thinking
how it affects me?

17:40.392 --> 17:42.926
Al...
You're just -
you're so selfish.

17:42.927 --> 17:46.664
It's always tim, tim, tim.
Just once, what about al?

17:46.665 --> 17:48.965
What about breakfast?
I got pancakes, waffles...

17:48.966 --> 17:50.467
I don't want breakfast!

17:50.468 --> 17:53.404
I want to know
why you're trying
to ruin my career.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.207
You wanna know why I don't
want to go national?
I'll tell you...

17:56.208 --> 17:59.643
Potatoes.
I got o'brien potatoes,
hash browns...

17:59.644 --> 18:01.678
I thought
I could count on you,

18:01.679 --> 18:04.147
But all you can think about
is yourself.

18:04.148 --> 18:09.319
I guess you just forgot
about a little word
called "loyalty."

18:13.959 --> 18:16.994
Would you remind me
one more time...

18:16.995 --> 18:19.997
Why I'm giving up my dream
for that man?

18:19.998 --> 18:22.933
Ok, ok, ok.

18:22.934 --> 18:24.768
Nothing's coming.
Yeah.

18:24.769 --> 18:27.004
So you're saying
I should fire al?
I'm not saying that.

18:27.005 --> 18:29.206
You're implying it.
I'm not implying that.

18:29.207 --> 18:31.942
Would you imply it,
please, please, please?

18:31.943 --> 18:33.944
I mean,
how could you fire al?

18:33.945 --> 18:36.280
He's like part of our family.

18:36.281 --> 18:39.383
Well, I just could treat him
like a member of your side.

18:42.587 --> 18:45.722
Hey, hey, there's my man tim.
Tim, how you doin'?

18:45.723 --> 18:47.724
Pretty good, bud.
Good to see you.

18:47.725 --> 18:50.060
Heard you drive up.
Sounds like a big block.

18:50.061 --> 18:52.262
Good ear.
I need to talk to you.

18:52.263 --> 18:54.865
I want to set up interviews
with new assistants.

18:54.866 --> 18:56.600
Don't bother.
I've thought about it.

18:56.601 --> 18:58.602
I'm not doing the show
without al.

18:58.603 --> 19:01.972
What are you talking about?
Even if it means staying
right where I am.

19:01.973 --> 19:05.542
I don't understand you.
Why are you going to the mat
for this guy?

19:05.543 --> 19:08.545
The only thing al borland's
ever done for you
is drag you down.

19:08.546 --> 19:10.681
No, I'm not doing the show
without al.

19:10.682 --> 19:12.983
He's a great tool man,
he can fix anything,

19:12.984 --> 19:15.186
And besides that,
he's my friend.

19:15.187 --> 19:19.323
You're making a really bad
business decision.
I don't see it that way.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.224
My gut tells me
your tests are wrong.

19:21.225 --> 19:24.028
America would love al
because al loves america.

19:24.029 --> 19:25.229
I do.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.233
Al, we were just talking
about you.

19:29.234 --> 19:30.968
I heard.

19:30.969 --> 19:32.502
Al, it's nothing personal.

19:32.503 --> 19:35.472
I just don't think
your style is right
for the show.

19:35.473 --> 19:38.075
W-wait a minute.
I think you're wrong.

19:38.076 --> 19:41.945
I mean,
is this man boring? Yes.

19:41.946 --> 19:45.515
Is he dull beyond belief?
You bet.

19:45.516 --> 19:49.820
A fashion nightmare?
Tell me somethin'
I don't know.

19:49.821 --> 19:54.324
Anybody can be hip or exciting.
One man dares to be dull.

19:54.325 --> 19:58.628
One man has the courage
to be monotonous, tedious
and uninteresting.

20:00.231 --> 20:02.465
That man is al borland.

20:04.169 --> 20:06.369
Thank you, tim.

20:06.370 --> 20:09.607
It's the interplay between us
that makes this show popular.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.408
Well, tim,
I respect your opinion,

20:11.409 --> 20:13.811
But it's just your opinion,
and it's my money.

20:13.812 --> 20:17.180
Well, tim is not interested
in your money.
Shut up, al.

20:19.117 --> 20:22.719
Give me time to prove we have
what it takes to go national.
Put me in ten cities.

20:22.720 --> 20:24.321
No way.
Eight cities.

20:24.322 --> 20:27.858
No, forget it.
Five cities, bud.

20:27.859 --> 20:31.361
Tim, you know,
you're a loyal guy.

20:31.362 --> 20:34.864
You went to bat for a friend,
and I respect that.

20:34.865 --> 20:37.134
I'll put you
in two new markets.

20:37.135 --> 20:39.002
We'll take it.
It's not up to you.

20:39.003 --> 20:41.471
Well, of course not.

20:41.472 --> 20:43.840
Done deal.
All right. Good luck.

20:43.841 --> 20:46.643
Now you got six months
to prove yourself.

20:46.644 --> 20:49.112
We won't
let you down, bud.
All right.

20:56.988 --> 20:59.823
I feel like the biggest jerk
in the world.

20:59.824 --> 21:02.092
Here I said
all those horrible things,

21:02.093 --> 21:04.261
And you were
just standing up for me.

21:04.262 --> 21:06.096
Don't give it
another thought.

21:06.097 --> 21:08.232
You would have done
the same for me.

21:08.233 --> 21:11.435
No, I am lucky
to have a friend like you.
You're as big as they come.

21:11.436 --> 21:14.638
Ohh...

21:14.639 --> 21:17.774
You're getting that
"I'm gonna hug you" look,
and I don't like that, al.

21:17.775 --> 21:20.344
Just a little one.
No, al...

21:20.345 --> 21:21.411
Aah!

21:24.682 --> 21:27.450
You're pushing me.

21:27.451 --> 21:28.652
You're fired!

21:28.653 --> 21:31.121
I am not,
you big friend, you.

21:40.432 --> 21:43.934
I want to show you something.
Unless you want to change.

21:43.935 --> 21:48.072
No, we've got an hour.
I'll stay casual.

21:48.073 --> 21:50.907
All right, I've been thinking
about going national.

21:50.908 --> 21:52.909
I've got something big
in mind.

21:52.910 --> 21:54.911
We've already done
a porta-potti show.

21:54.912 --> 21:57.147
No. I made some adjustments.

21:57.148 --> 21:59.883
A few modifications, ok?
All right.

21:59.884 --> 22:02.553
You know how those guys eat
on the job site?

22:02.554 --> 22:04.854
I got a man-size...

22:04.855 --> 22:06.923
Air freshener.

22:09.294 --> 22:11.128
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

22:11.129 --> 22:13.130
I'm gonna
take this porta-potti

22:13.131 --> 22:15.132
Where it's never been
before, ok?

22:15.133 --> 22:18.135
I'm gonna make it easier
to move from job site
to job site.

22:18.136 --> 22:20.637
And how are you
gonna do that?
Small motor.

22:20.638 --> 22:22.872
<i>(motor whirring)</i>

22:40.124 --> 22:42.626
And they were gonna
fire <i>me.</i>

22:45.296 --> 22:48.165
You're getting that
"I'm gonna hug you" look,
and I don't like that, al.

22:48.166 --> 22:51.001
Just a little one.
No, al...

22:51.002 --> 22:52.469
Aah!

22:55.006 --> 22:57.774
You're pushing me.

22:57.775 --> 22:59.075
You're fired!

22:59.076 --> 23:01.678
I am not,
you big friend, you.
