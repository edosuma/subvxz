HEY, JENNY--

25:20.152 --> 25:22.622
HOW'S EVERYTHING WORKING OUT
WITH HER, ANYWAY?

25:22.655 --> 25:23.623
GREAT.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.257
SHE'S SO GOOD.

25:25.291 --> 25:26.358
I MEAN, I JUST DON'T--

25:26.392 --> 25:29.328
IMAGINE WHAT LIFE WOULD HAVE
BEEN LIKE WITHOUT HER.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.898
BECAUSE I HAVE TO SAY,
YOU KNOW,

25:31.931 --> 25:34.100
SOMETHING WASN'T QUITE
SITTING RIGHT WITH ME ABOUT HER,

25:34.133 --> 25:36.268
SO I, UM, DID A LITTLE
BACKGROUND CHECK ON HER.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.705
OKAY. SO?

25:38.738 --> 25:40.106
REMEMBER HOW
SHE SAID HER MOM

25:40.139 --> 25:41.708
WAS HOSPITALIZED
FROM '86 TO '92?

25:41.741 --> 25:43.242
MM-HMM.

25:43.275 --> 25:45.144
AND THAT HER DAD
WAS A TRAVELLING SALESMAN?

25:45.177 --> 25:47.013
RIGHT.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.715
WELL, OKAY, SHE SAID
HE WAS OUT ON THE ROAD

25:48.748 --> 25:49.716
THE WHOLE TIME

25:49.749 --> 25:51.050
SHE WAS IN
THE HOSPITAL, RIGHT?

25:51.083 --> 25:52.051
YEAH?

25:52.084 --> 25:53.185
THEN SHE SAID

25:53.219 --> 25:55.221
HE HURT HIS BACK
IN A FACTORY ACCIDENT.

25:55.254 --> 25:57.223
I MEAN, I DON'T GET IT.

25:57.256 --> 26:01.694
MAX, I DON'T NEED TO KNOW
THIS SHIT

26:01.728 --> 26:04.664
BEFORE FESTIVITIES BEGIN.

26:04.697 --> 26:05.832
I GOT TO SAY,
I LIKE ADELE.

26:05.865 --> 26:06.966
I JUST THINK
SHE'S A SWEETHEART.

26:06.999 --> 26:08.100
YEAH, I KNOW.

26:08.134 --> 26:11.237
IT'S JUST I JUST CHECKED OUT
HER STORY A LITTLE BIT,

26:11.270 --> 26:14.641
AND, UM, THE HOSPITAL SHE SAID
HER MOM WAS IN FROM '86 TO '92--

26:14.674 --> 26:16.375
THE BIRDWELL SANITARIUM--

26:16.408 --> 26:17.944
IT CLOSED IN '87.

26:17.977 --> 26:19.011
WELL,
I'M GOING TO ASSUME

26:19.045 --> 26:20.146
THAT'S BECAUSE

26:20.179 --> 26:21.648
IT WAS A TROUBLING TIME
IN HER LIFE

26:21.681 --> 26:23.082
AND HER MEMORY'S
NOT THAT CLEAR ON IT.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.951
YEAH, MAX.

26:24.984 --> 26:26.886
MAYBE.
ADELE!

26:26.919 --> 26:28.688
ADELE, COME HERE.
JENNY, DON'T TELL HER.

26:28.721 --> 26:29.789
DON'T. COME ON!

26:29.822 --> 26:31.658
ADELE!
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH?

26:31.691 --> 26:33.125
WHAT IS IT?

26:33.159 --> 26:35.294
MAX THINKS THAT
THERE'S SOMETHING

26:35.327 --> 26:36.729
REALLY SUSPICIOUS
ABOUT YOU,

26:36.763 --> 26:38.030
BECAUSE HE SAID
THAT THE SANITARIUM

26:38.064 --> 26:39.832
THAT YOU SAID
YOUR MOTHER WAS IN

26:39.866 --> 26:41.267
WHILE SHE WAS SICK

26:41.300 --> 26:43.369
WAS ACTUALLY CLOSED.

26:43.402 --> 26:44.704
ADELE, IT'S NOT LIKE

26:44.737 --> 26:46.038
I WAS CHECKING UP ON YOU
OR ANYTHING.

26:46.072 --> 26:47.740
I WAS RESEARCHING
SOMETHING FOR ALICE,

26:47.774 --> 26:48.741
AND I RAN ACROSS THIS THING--

26:48.775 --> 26:49.976
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

26:50.009 --> 26:51.243
I WANTED TO CLEAR THE AIR,
YOU KNOW?

26:51.277 --> 26:52.945
YEAH, THAT'S TOTALLY FINE.

26:52.979 --> 26:55.181
I MEAN, I GET WHY
IT WOULD BE CONFUSING.

26:55.214 --> 26:57.984
UM...

26:58.017 --> 27:01.320
MY MOM WAS--
SHE WAS AT BIRDWELL,

27:01.353 --> 27:05.191
BUT SHE--
WHEN SHE TRIED TO--

27:09.729 --> 27:12.064
SORRY.

27:12.098 --> 27:13.299
OH...

27:13.332 --> 27:16.268
SHE...

27:16.302 --> 27:19.706
WE HAD TO TAKE HER
TO A HIGH-SECURITY INSTITUTION,

27:19.739 --> 27:20.707
DOWN IN WINTER PARK.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.041
SO, I DON'T KNOW,

27:22.074 --> 27:23.409
MAYBE BIRDWELL
CLOSED DOWN AFTER THAT.

27:23.442 --> 27:25.778
I DON'T KNOW.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.747
OKAY.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.281
I'M GOING TO GO FINISH.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.752
JUST GO FINISH
HANGING THE LIGHTS.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.855
NOW THAT
WAS SOME GOOD THINKING.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.694
[MALE DIRECTOR]:
OKAY, EVERYBODY SETTLE.

27:41.728 --> 27:48.267
WE'RE BACK IN FIVE, FOUR,
THREE, TWO...

27:48.300 --> 27:50.737
MS. PIESZECKI, WHY
DID YOU FEEL COMPELLED

27:50.770 --> 27:52.739
TO POST THE FOOTAGE
YOU SHOT OF DARYL BREWER

27:52.772 --> 27:53.740
ON THE INTERNET?

27:53.773 --> 27:57.476
OH, WELL, ORIGINALLY,
I DIDN'T VIDEOTAPE HIM

27:57.509 --> 27:59.445
WITH THE INTENTION
OF OUTTING HIM,

27:59.478 --> 28:00.947
IT WAS MORE OF A PERSONAL--
NOW, IT'S HARD
TO BELIEVE

28:00.980 --> 28:02.381
THAT YOU WEREN'T SEEKING
NOTORIETY

28:02.414 --> 28:03.549
BY FILMING HIM

28:03.582 --> 28:05.885
AND THEN POSTING THE FOOTAGE
ON YOUR WEBSITE.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.119
NO, I-- NO.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.155
I JUST THOUGHT
IT WAS VERY MEAN,

28:09.188 --> 28:10.757
WHAT HE SAID ABOUT GAY PEOPLE--

28:10.790 --> 28:12.291
THAT'S FREEDOM
OF SPEECH.

28:12.324 --> 28:15.094
THAT'S HIS PREROGATIVE,
TO SAY WHATEVER HE WANTS TO,

28:15.127 --> 28:16.162
BUT IT'S A VIOLATION

28:16.195 --> 28:17.964
OF HIS PRIVACY

28:17.997 --> 28:19.131
IF YOU'RE GOING TO
VIDEOTAPE HIM

28:19.165 --> 28:21.067
WHEN HE DOESN'T THINK
HE'S BEING WATCHED,

28:21.100 --> 28:23.202
AND THEN HAVE IT PUT UP
ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB!

28:23.235 --> 28:25.337
NO, I-- I DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD GET SO BIG.

28:25.371 --> 28:26.773
YOU NEVER THOUGHT
IT WOULD GET SO BIG?

28:26.806 --> 28:27.974
YOU'RE AN INTERNET JOURNALIST,

28:28.007 --> 28:30.342
AND YOU DIDN'T REALIZE
THE POWER OF THE NET?

28:30.376 --> 28:31.477
COME ON!

28:31.510 --> 28:33.145
I MEAN, THESE THINGS
GO VIRAL IN AN INSTANT.

28:33.179 --> 28:34.914
IT DESTROYS CAREERS!

28:34.947 --> 28:38.751
IMUS, ISAIAH WASHINGTON,
YOU KNOW, THE LIST GOES ON!

28:38.785 --> 28:39.685
YEAH, BUT IT WASN'T LIKE THAT--

28:39.718 --> 28:40.753
DO YOU REGRET
WHAT YOU DID,

28:40.787 --> 28:41.921
MS. PIESZECKI?

28:41.954 --> 28:42.989
DO YOU CARE
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE DESTROYED

28:43.022 --> 28:44.824
THIS MAN'S FAMILY?
I DON'T BUY THAT--

28:44.857 --> 28:45.825
WAIT A MINUTE!

28:45.858 --> 28:47.927
WHY SHOULD I FEEL BAD
FOR HURTING THIS GUY?

28:47.960 --> 28:50.763
I MEAN, WHEN HE'S HURTING ME
AND MILLIONS OF OTHER GAY PEOPLE

28:50.797 --> 28:52.198
BY SAYING SUCH HATEFUL COMMENTS?

28:52.231 --> 28:54.366
YEAH, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS--

28:54.400 --> 28:55.534
HE STARTED THIS

28:55.567 --> 28:57.536
BY SAYING AWFUL THINGS
IN THE FIRST PLACE!

28:57.569 --> 28:58.905
SO, YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE IT
UPON YOURSELF

28:58.938 --> 29:00.306
TO GO AFTER--
NO, I'M TALKING!

29:00.339 --> 29:01.340
I'M NOT FINISHED!

29:01.373 --> 29:02.842
LISTEN.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.243
GAY PEOPLE ARE BASHED

29:04.276 --> 29:06.112
AND-- AND HARASSED

29:06.145 --> 29:07.914
AND KILLED EVERY DAY,

29:07.947 --> 29:10.149
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THIS GUY,
WHO'S GAY HIMSELF,

29:10.182 --> 29:12.518
AND HE'S SAYING
THIS GARBAGE?

29:12.551 --> 29:14.854
IT'S DISGUSTING!

29:14.887 --> 29:17.123
I TOTALLY RESPECT

29:17.156 --> 29:19.558
SOMEONE'S CHOICE
TO STAY IN THE CLOSET, I DO.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.527
IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO DO,
I GET IT,

29:21.560 --> 29:22.862
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S OKAY

29:22.895 --> 29:24.496
TO KISS YOUR BOYFRIEND ONE DAY

29:24.530 --> 29:26.532
AND THEN GO OUT
AND TRASH GAY PEOPLE THE NEXT--

29:26.565 --> 29:29.902
ESPECIALLY IF
YOU'RE A PUBLIC FIGURE

29:29.936 --> 29:31.871
AND YOU HAVE PEOPLE
LOOKING UP TO YOU!

29:31.904 --> 29:33.405
SO, NO, I DON'T FEEL BAD.

29:33.439 --> 29:35.274
I DO NOT FEEL BAD
ABOUT WHAT I DID.

29:35.307 --> 29:37.977
WELL, SHE'S GOT
A GOOD POINT, PAT.

29:38.010 --> 29:38.911
UH, I'D LIKE TO ACTUALLY
GO BACK

29:38.945 --> 29:40.179

WE SPOKE ABOUT EARLIER,

29:47.553 --> 29:49.288

29:50.322 --> 29:51.090
YEAH.

29:51.123 --> 29:54.526
WHY DON'T WE
JUST SKIP THE PARTY?

29:54.560 --> 29:57.163
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO GIVE
JENNY THE SATISFACTION.

29:57.196 --> 29:58.998
NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.900
I'M LETTING THAT GO.

30:03.502 --> 30:07.539
JENNY CAN DO WHATEVER SHE WANTS
WITH HER SILLY MOVIE.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.909
I'M COMPLETELY DETACHED
FROM THE NOTION

30:09.942 --> 30:11.577
THAT IT HAS ANYTHING TO DO
WITH MY LIFE.

30:11.610 --> 30:12.912
IT IS FICTION.

30:12.945 --> 30:13.913

30:15.915 --> 30:18.317

STAY HERE WITH YOU.

30:18.350 --> 30:22.021
I'VE BEEN MISSING YOU...

30:22.054 --> 30:26.058

30:28.327 --> 30:30.396
I THINK WE NEED TO RECONNECT.

35:08.374 --> 35:10.842

THAT JENNY'S IDIOTIC DRIVEL

36:02.994 --> 36:05.331

SHE'S NICE AND INTERESTING.

36:57.483 --> 36:59.251
SHE'S ALL OVER YOU.

36:59.285 --> 37:01.620
YOU'RE INSANE.

37:01.653 --> 37:03.889
SHE'S THE STRAIGHTEST PERSON
I'VE EVER MET.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.558
I WAS TRYING TO EXPLAIN TO HER
HOW LESBIAN SEX WORKS.

37:06.592 --> 37:09.628

[EXHALING DEEPLY]

54:22.727 --> 54:24.629
I COULDN'T LET HER DRIVE.

54:24.662 --> 54:26.030
* AND THEY STRETCH OUT
TO THE SEA *

54:26.063 --> 54:29.266
I'M GOING TO GET HER A PILLOW.

54:30.668 --> 54:35.406
* AS FAR AS YOU FROM ME

54:38.676 --> 54:44.048
* AND THE RED ROSE
FOR STARLETS *

54:47.718 --> 54:51.055
* AND THE WHITE ROSE
FOR WISDOM *

54:55.460 --> 54:59.630
* AND GOD ONLY ASKED
FOR FRIENDS *

55:03.868 --> 55:10.341
* AND GOD
ONLY ASKED FOR SYMPATHY *

55:12.543 --> 55:16.681
* BUT HE'S JUST AS BORED
AS ANYONE *

55:20.951 --> 55:25.089
* AS FRANTIC FOR SECURITY

55:29.560 --> 55:33.698
* AND THE RED ROSE
FOR STARLETS *

55:37.935 --> 55:42.072
* AND THE WHITE ROSE
FOR WISDOM *

55:46.110 --> 55:48.679
* GIVE ME NAKED FLESH

55:48.713 --> 55:50.080
