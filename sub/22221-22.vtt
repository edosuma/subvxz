WEBVTT

00:08.342 --> 00:10.298
Ah, there you are.

00:10.386 --> 00:12.672
We're dividing spoils
from the depository.

00:12.763 --> 00:16.631
These were set aside for you
to choose from and I
understand that...

00:16.726 --> 00:18.591
(groaning)
She is burnt.

00:18.686 --> 00:21.393
She's badly crippled because
of our desires.

00:21.480 --> 00:22.856
Let go!

00:22.940 --> 00:25.352
Was all this wealth worth it?

00:25.443 --> 00:29.152
Course not you blue bitch,
but what's done is done.

00:29.238 --> 00:31.194
Just as long as we're
wealthy, huh?

00:31.282 --> 00:33.238
May as well put it to good use.

00:33.326 --> 00:36.568
Crais and Talyn have located
some kind of surgeon.

00:36.662 --> 00:38.163
A healer species.

00:38.247 --> 00:40.078
We're almost there.

00:40.166 --> 00:42.373
We're all choosing one or
two items we want.

00:42.460 --> 00:46.169
The rest is to pay any fee
for Moya's remedy.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.959
I'm sorry Rygel,
l misjudged you.

00:50.051 --> 00:52.508
Hal It's becoming your career.

00:52.595 --> 00:55.177
(whooshing )

01:01.103 --> 01:05.187
Scorpius:
Now listen, John. Be smart.

01:05.274 --> 01:07.310
See the situation for
what it is.

01:07.401 --> 01:08.652
Screw you!

01:09.695 --> 01:12.653
No, John. Not this time.

01:12.740 --> 01:16.073
We've reached the end of the
old. The beginning of the new.

01:16.160 --> 01:17.149
I am in control.

01:17.245 --> 01:19.406
lam in control of me!

01:20.206 --> 01:21.696
No more, John.

01:21.791 --> 01:23.907
Screw you!

01:24.001 --> 01:26.253
The reverse is more likely.

01:26.337 --> 01:28.293
(Crichton yelling )

01:29.674 --> 01:31.335
Stop it! Stop it!

01:31.425 --> 01:33.256
Stop it!

01:33.344 --> 01:34.629
I can't, I can't!

01:34.720 --> 01:37.553
There's no one here, John.
You made yourself bleed.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.505
Scorpius! Scorpius! Scorpius!

01:39.600 --> 01:41.932
Yes. Listen! He put a
neurotracer chip in your brain.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.555
You know this. You know
he isn't really here.

01:43.646 --> 01:45.887
| see him! I see him!
-Well, fight it.

01:45.982 --> 01:47.188
Listen to me.

01:47.275 --> 01:49.641
We've reached the
surgical facility.

01:49.735 --> 01:52.522
We're going to see if they
can remove the chip.

01:55.074 --> 01:56.280
l have to smash him.

01:56.367 --> 01:58.358
No. Scorpius isn't
really there.

01:58.452 --> 02:01.819
John, I need you to face
reality as it is.

02:01.914 --> 02:04.200
It's ridiculous, I know.

02:04.292 --> 02:06.328
She cannot see us, John.

02:08.212 --> 02:10.077
What's happening to me?

02:10.172 --> 02:11.958
You know what's
happening to you.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.791
Scorpius put that frelling
chip in your brain.

02:15.678 --> 02:17.464
Aeryn,

02:18.306 --> 02:22.470
what do you see, in the mirror?

02:23.394 --> 02:24.224
What do you see?

02:24.312 --> 02:26.268
There is no mirror.

02:26.355 --> 02:28.311
There is no Scorpius.

02:29.108 --> 02:30.348
Look.

02:32.862 --> 02:36.901
You must confront your
fears with strength.

02:40.119 --> 02:43.156
You're right, Aeryn.

02:45.583 --> 02:48.290
There's no Scorpius here.

02:49.712 --> 02:51.373
Mmm...

02:52.298 --> 02:54.459
There's only me.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.424
Yeah.

03:00.931 --> 03:03.092
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

03:03.184 --> 03:06.347
A radiation wave hit and I got
shot through a wormhole.

03:06.437 --> 03:09.144
Now I'm lost in some distant
part of the universe on a ship,

03:09.231 --> 03:12.815
a living ship, full of strange
alien life-forms.

03:12.902 --> 03:13.641
Help me.

03:13.736 --> 03:15.192
Listen, please.

03:15.279 --> 03:17.065
Is there anybody out there
who can hear me?

03:17.156 --> 03:21.195
I'm being hunted by an insane
military commander.

03:21.285 --> 03:23.651
I'm doing everything I can.

03:23.746 --> 03:26.579
I'm just looking for
a way home.

03:50.064 --> 03:52.271
(speaks alien language)

03:52.358 --> 03:56.692
Grunchlk:
If it wasn't serious, they
wouldn't have called us, would they?

03:56.779 --> 04:00.442
Now when you're done,
the big picture.
-I don't like him.

04:00.533 --> 04:03.741
D'Argo:
He's rumored to be one of
the best healers in the Uncharted Territories.

04:03.828 --> 04:07.741
No, not him. His sleazy
confederate Gunsik.

04:07.832 --> 04:10.198
Grun-chlk.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.283
Splendid hearing.

04:12.378 --> 04:13.788
Doc fixed it.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.380
Can he save Moya?

04:15.464 --> 04:17.045
Oh, looks good.

04:17.133 --> 04:18.964
He's splendid with infections.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.258
(speaks alien language)

04:21.345 --> 04:25.258
He'll make up a mixture that
will be absorbed through these
scarred areas,

04:25.349 --> 04:27.214
and then a couple of
applications,

04:27.309 --> 04:29.766
keep the patient sedated,
you're laughing.

04:29.854 --> 04:31.060
How much?

04:31.147 --> 04:35.891
Oh, by my calculations,
let's say, ah,

04:35.985 --> 04:40.024
exchange equivalent with the
meter and all of that,
12,000 kretmers.

04:40.114 --> 04:41.103
Outrageous!

04:41.198 --> 04:42.529
(speaks alien language)

04:42.616 --> 04:45.528
Uh, just a microt.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.701
Listen, britchka...

04:47.788 --> 04:49.995
(Chiana whispering ):
I don't know. What do you think?

04:50.082 --> 04:52.073
I don't know that we have any
choice.

04:52.168 --> 04:53.658
She's got to get fixed,
but this is crazy.

04:53.752 --> 04:56.004
Grunchlk:
Or you think you can run that
facility without me?

04:57.465 --> 04:58.705
Shh.

05:00.301 --> 05:03.338
He always thinks I undercharge.

05:03.429 --> 05:06.546
He's a greedy bastard.
It's a species trade.

05:06.640 --> 05:10.178
Now I'm sorry to have to do
this to you, but he insists.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.759
That's 15,000 kretmers.

05:11.854 --> 05:14.061
I could buy a whole
new ship for that.

05:14.148 --> 05:18.733
Yeah. I had to let an aunt die
once because we couldn't
afford to fix her.

05:23.991 --> 05:27.028
I'm going to go and
assess our funds.

05:27.119 --> 05:29.952
Chiana:
If you don't make her better,
we're going to get you!

05:30.039 --> 05:31.119
Grunchlk:
Let me introduce you...

05:31.207 --> 05:32.822
D'Argo:
Chiana!

05:34.502 --> 05:36.288
Leave him alone.

05:38.214 --> 05:39.203
(speaks alien language)

05:39.298 --> 05:40.879
Why do you wear that mask?

05:40.966 --> 05:46.802
Dr. Diagnosan intuits disease
through inhalation, here.

05:46.889 --> 05:49.175
Very, very sensitive.

05:49.266 --> 05:50.346
( sneezes )

05:52.686 --> 05:57.350
Even the siljot bacteria in your
beautiful hair would kill him

05:57.441 --> 06:00.774
if he got it in his nose and
his mouth at the same time.

06:10.246 --> 06:12.828
Ah, Crichton, a word if I may.

06:12.915 --> 06:14.121
Not now, Rygel.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.120
Now works for me. So, if you
haven't chosen a bauble yet...

06:17.211 --> 06:18.121
Rygel, shut up.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.168
(yells and chokes)

06:20.256 --> 06:21.712
(coughing)

06:21.799 --> 06:24.336
(sighs)

06:24.426 --> 06:26.712
If I take you to him...
-I don't want to have
them repaired.

06:26.804 --> 06:29.261
He's a surgeon.
We have currency.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.464
I'm sure that we...
-Father, you're not
listening to me.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.299
Aeryn:
All right Rygel, I'll
take care of it.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.555
Well, he just tried to force
this jinka stone down my throat.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.136
What'd | just say?
-Ohh!

06:37.231 --> 06:39.187
I can't see why you wouldn't
want your tankas restored.

06:39.275 --> 06:41.140
I mean, as a Luxan....

06:41.235 --> 06:43.851
I'm only half Luxan.

06:43.946 --> 06:46.483
And for many cycles, I didn't
even want to be that.

06:48.409 --> 06:50.274
You out yourself.

06:51.328 --> 06:55.367
You mutilated your own tenkas.

06:56.625 --> 06:58.832
You hate me that much?

07:01.630 --> 07:03.586
It's okay.

07:06.594 --> 07:09.176
It doesn't hurt anymore, Father.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.014
(yelling):
What?!

07:18.314 --> 07:20.680
Sorry, Chiana, l, uh...

07:23.319 --> 07:25.776
A moment ago, you said 17,500.

07:25.863 --> 07:29.321
Expenses, experience, expertise.
The meter is still running.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.273
20,000 is the rate.

07:31.368 --> 07:33.654
I'll pay 18 and not
a kretmer more.

07:33.746 --> 07:35.407
Got it? Oh!

07:36.457 --> 07:39.164
I hate to negotiate like this,

07:39.251 --> 07:42.118
but I do find it cuts
through the critada.

07:42.212 --> 07:44.373
Put him down, Greenchalk.

07:44.465 --> 07:47.172
Grun-chlk.

07:47.259 --> 07:49.170
This is business.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.297
l have the supply.

07:51.388 --> 07:53.925
| make the demand.

07:54.016 --> 07:55.381
(speaks alien language)

07:55.476 --> 07:57.216
It's all right, Doctor.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.552
The family are in denial.

07:59.647 --> 08:02.059
lwon't let them
hurt each other.

08:03.400 --> 08:08.144
Take the 20,000,
before it goes up.

08:12.534 --> 08:15.071
Crichton?

08:15.162 --> 08:19.872
Um, Pilot says you're
reconfiguring a Comms signal
outside his control.

08:19.958 --> 08:24.201
I want to eavesdrop on Crais'
radio traffic without him
knowing about it.

08:24.296 --> 08:25.456
I still don't trust him here.

08:25.547 --> 08:28.209
Crais and Talyn saved our lives.
They saved yours.

08:28.300 --> 08:29.506
Look, Aeryn, if you're
worried about the...

08:29.593 --> 08:32.835
(whistles )
inside my head, don't.

08:32.930 --> 08:34.295
He's under house arrest.

08:34.390 --> 08:36.551
Remember what you said?
Strength.

08:36.642 --> 08:39.554
That's great, John, but you
need to stop what you're doing.

08:39.645 --> 08:43.308
Aeryn, as long as | stay busy,

08:44.274 --> 08:46.310
he leaves me alone.

08:46.402 --> 08:48.438
Sometimes if! sing,
he leaves me alone.

08:48.529 --> 08:51.441
Dun, da-da, da, da, dun,
da-da, da, da...

08:51.532 --> 08:54.148
Dun, da-da, da, da...

08:54.618 --> 08:56.233
Dun, da-da, da.

08:56.328 --> 09:00.947
Look, once the Diagnosan's
finished with Moya,

09:01.041 --> 09:03.373
he's going to take a
look at you.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.575
It won't help.

09:04.670 --> 09:07.332
Hmm...

09:07.423 --> 09:16.172
lam reminded at this point of
a word that you actually
brought to this vessel.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.096
Hope.

09:25.649 --> 09:29.892
I would be lost without you.

09:33.282 --> 09:35.614
Then you'll never be lost.

09:39.204 --> 09:42.241
No matter what happens,

09:42.332 --> 09:49.204
you have worked your way
into my heart.

09:53.427 --> 09:56.385
You've shown me that l have one.

10:01.310 --> 10:03.301
I love you.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.560
I love you, too.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.280
Mmm...

10:18.327 --> 10:23.412
You are so my girl.

10:29.838 --> 10:31.214
Crais:
Now, listen to me.

10:31.298 --> 10:35.667
Officer Sun cannot be
blackmailed or enticed.

10:35.761 --> 10:39.299
If she is tojoin us, it would
have to be of her own volition.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.220
( beeping )

10:41.308 --> 10:42.764
Agreed.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.012
If she joins us freely,
we will tell her the truth.

10:45.103 --> 10:47.355
( beeping )

10:47.439 --> 10:48.895
What's that coming through?

10:48.982 --> 10:51.359
Identify the source
of the signal!

10:51.443 --> 10:52.683
Play it loud!

10:52.778 --> 10:54.769
D'Argo:
It's a Peacekeeper signal.

10:54.863 --> 10:59.323
Pilot:
Crais says it's a special
pulse code, known only to Captain's rank and above.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.660
He's never been a Peacekeeper.

11:00.744 --> 11:02.530
Must be the neuro-circuit that
Scorpius implanted in his brain.

11:02.621 --> 11:04.486
What are we going to do
when we find it?
-You? Nothing. It's too dangerous.

11:04.581 --> 11:05.445
Dad...

11:05.541 --> 11:06.781
No!

11:25.435 --> 11:27.391
Stop what you're doing.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.428
Relax, boy.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.559
You're not in any danger.

11:31.650 --> 11:34.187
Scorpius only wants me.

11:34.278 --> 11:36.519
My father says you're in no
condition to make that decision.

11:36.613 --> 11:38.569
And you're in no condition
to stop me.

11:38.657 --> 11:41.148
Step back!

11:42.286 --> 11:43.901
Oh, my.

11:43.996 --> 11:46.954
You really should have
brought a pulse rifle.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.246
(hiss)

11:51.003 --> 11:52.413
(sighs)

11:52.504 --> 11:54.916
Like father, like son.

11:55.007 --> 11:56.042
(loud whip)

11:56.133 --> 11:58.089
(grunts)

11:59.011 --> 12:00.751
Hardly.

12:12.316 --> 12:14.227
How do you feel?

12:14.318 --> 12:16.229
Like a popsicle.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.232
Gotta love this sphincter end
of the universe.

12:19.323 --> 12:23.111
They're just going to have a
look. An examination.

12:23.201 --> 12:25.738
Make sure he puts the
KY on the glove.

12:28.916 --> 12:31.328
What the hell are
you doing here?

12:31.418 --> 12:33.283
A meagre gesture of support,

12:33.378 --> 12:36.120
while the others attend
to Aeryn and Jothee.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.715
Is there any permanent damage?

12:37.799 --> 12:39.460
Just their pride.

12:40.719 --> 12:43.552
You seem remarkably lucid.

12:43.639 --> 12:45.254
Don't get too close.

12:45.349 --> 12:46.509
I could turn any second.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.181
Stark:
We'll fix it, Crichton.

12:48.268 --> 12:50.224
Everyone's pledged to give
whatever it takes to...

12:50.312 --> 12:53.349
(speaks alien language)

12:54.316 --> 12:55.647
(grunts)

12:58.528 --> 13:00.814
( high-pitched whine)

13:09.331 --> 13:11.697
I thought he couldn't inhale
our contaminants.

13:11.792 --> 13:13.157
You see the green light?

13:13.251 --> 13:15.037
That's a biological
neutralizer, that is.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.120
You could have the Caritonga
plague in here, wouldn't
touch him.

13:18.215 --> 13:21.799
Outside, pick your nose,
and he's dead.

13:21.885 --> 13:24.217
No... pain.

13:25.389 --> 13:28.131
Re... lax.

13:44.616 --> 13:48.154
Grunchlk:
Phoar, frelling critada!

13:48.245 --> 13:52.204
(speaks alien language)

13:52.290 --> 13:55.248
You're going to tell me
my health plan doesn't
cover this, right?

13:57.337 --> 14:01.376
(speaks alien language)

14:03.635 --> 14:06.422
Doctor doesn't often say this.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.471
There's nothin' he can do.

14:10.267 --> 14:11.973
That thing in his head, he...

14:12.060 --> 14:14.551
he can't get it out without
killing him.

14:16.690 --> 14:19.557
(chuckling)

14:26.366 --> 14:29.574
D'Argo, the surgeon said it's a
numbing anesthetic, okay?

14:29.661 --> 14:31.777
So... so don't breathe
too much, all right?

14:31.872 --> 14:33.533
And shake the canister
every couple of...
-All right, already.

14:33.623 --> 14:35.159
I remember.

14:35.250 --> 14:37.366
What's the matter with you?
-What's the matter with you?

14:39.421 --> 14:40.410
I'm just, I...

14:40.505 --> 14:42.166
I'm trying to have
a relationship.

14:42.257 --> 14:44.339
And you think I'm not?

14:46.386 --> 14:48.126
(sighs)

14:50.307 --> 14:53.140
Listen Chiana, you have
to understand.

14:53.226 --> 14:57.185
It has been so long since
I've seen my son.
-D'Argo, I know how long it is.

14:57.272 --> 15:02.312
There is no one, no one who has
lived this dream of finding
your son more than me.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.313
You going to help, D'Argo?

15:04.404 --> 15:06.690
Couldn't you wait a couple
of microts, Stark?

15:06.782 --> 15:09.364
l was talking to Chiana.

15:10.827 --> 15:14.740
Tocot says we got to put down
another layer of Dowlandium...

15:14.831 --> 15:17.368
Frell you.
-after the first has
been absorbed.

15:17.459 --> 15:20.121
Oh, you understand him.

15:20.212 --> 15:22.669
Crichton:
How many bodies did he
say were in here?

15:22.756 --> 15:26.169
Aeryn:
I believe he said
frelling millions.

15:28.470 --> 15:32.338
Aeryn, ah, did I...

15:32.432 --> 15:37.051
say or do anything to
piss you off?

15:37.145 --> 15:40.433
I mean other than caving in
the side of your head?

15:41.233 --> 15:43.440
Are you serious?

15:44.653 --> 15:46.359
Do you not remember?

15:50.784 --> 15:52.900
Splendid news for the patient.

15:52.994 --> 15:56.407
I think I found a
biological match.

15:56.498 --> 15:58.113
What? You found a human?

15:58.208 --> 16:00.290
Well, it's called an lnterion.

16:00.377 --> 16:06.247
It's bipedal, central spine,
organs internal.

16:06.341 --> 16:09.174
Oh, single heart circulation
and small head.

16:09.261 --> 16:11.752
I've got three specimens.
That's the best I can do.

16:11.847 --> 16:15.180
There are over 5,000 different
species frozen here.

16:15.267 --> 16:17.303
This is an abomination
against nature.

16:17.394 --> 16:19.931
It's not as though they're
suffering, love, is it?

16:20.021 --> 16:21.272
Yeah.

16:21.356 --> 16:23.813
I mean, they're already
dead anyway.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.561
No Aeryn, they're still alive.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.153
That's a technicality.

16:27.237 --> 16:30.024
No, I'm not accepting anything
from someone who's alive.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.855
They're all accident victims
and the like.

16:31.950 --> 16:34.316
Hey, I mean we freeze them a
microt before their death,

16:34.411 --> 16:36.197
'cause the parts last
longer that way.

16:36.288 --> 16:38.244
You have interrupted the
course of nature.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.162
None of 'em would survive
restoration.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.538
That is the Doc's rules for
accepting a donor.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.539
And you've got three like me?

16:45.630 --> 16:47.666
Well, similar.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.464
I mean it's probably a species
offshoot from the same stuff.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.259
Is that possible?

16:56.349 --> 16:58.305
We're somewhere near Earth?

16:58.393 --> 16:59.894
I don't know.

17:06.860 --> 17:07.895
I want this chip out.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.317
Splendid.

17:09.404 --> 17:14.364
'Course, if it ah, don't work,
we get to keep your body.

17:17.245 --> 17:18.701
That's it, D'Argo.

17:18.788 --> 17:20.119
I can't feel my tongue.

17:20.207 --> 17:22.289
Whose fault is that?

17:22.375 --> 17:24.411
Oh, frell you.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.754
Ah... naa... tha... aa....

17:29.841 --> 17:33.333
You know what my dad wants to
do with his share of the money?

17:34.304 --> 17:36.135
Buy a farm.

17:36.223 --> 17:37.303
Really?

17:37.390 --> 17:41.679
Mmm. He wants to grow prowsa
fruit and make wine.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.556
I don't want to live on a farm.

17:43.647 --> 17:45.433
I've been a slave.

17:45.523 --> 17:47.900
Been chained to the mine.

17:47.984 --> 17:50.566
He wants to live the quiet life.

17:50.654 --> 17:52.235
I want to live loudly.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.279
Well I didn't know that.

17:58.370 --> 18:01.487
I, um... I guess it was going
to be just you two.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.789
(slurring ):
Oh, you, too, Chiana.

18:04.876 --> 18:07.333
Pilot, you're high, okay?

18:07.420 --> 18:12.005
I am no higher or lower
than I've ever been.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.208
My position is fixed.

18:14.302 --> 18:18.636
No, no, I mean the drug in Moya,
it's messing with your brain.

18:18.723 --> 18:24.309
He's been using my
DRDs to practice.

18:24.396 --> 18:27.388
Wanna see? Secret.

18:27.482 --> 18:30.440
Chiana...

18:30.527 --> 18:33.519
you know that l have to spend a
lot more time with Jothee

18:33.613 --> 18:39.904
so I was hoping we could all
find a quiet place and, uh...

18:41.329 --> 18:43.445
settle down together.

18:45.333 --> 18:49.201
I was hoping you would
consent to be my wife.

18:51.006 --> 18:52.212
Huh.

18:54.718 --> 18:56.379
(exhales loudly)

18:57.095 --> 18:58.460
What?

18:59.889 --> 19:02.722
What a surprise to
find you eating.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.224
So, Gunshock,

19:05.312 --> 19:08.179
how long will it be before the
surgeon can operate on Crichton?

19:08.273 --> 19:09.729
What, seven or eight arns.

19:09.816 --> 19:12.398
He wants to finish supervising
the medication of your ship.

19:12.485 --> 19:17.980
He's ah, splendidly
conscientious.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.781
Well, we'll just keep Crichton
restrained until you're ready.

19:20.869 --> 19:22.484
Yeah.
-Good.

19:22.579 --> 19:24.285
Anything else?

19:24.372 --> 19:25.532
What are you up to?

19:25.623 --> 19:28.080
Higher level reasoning, Aeryn.

19:28.168 --> 19:31.660
If a simple thought occurs,
I'll call you.

19:36.384 --> 19:37.999
As I was saying,

19:38.094 --> 19:42.212
you must know your way around
this backwater part
of the galaxy.

19:44.476 --> 19:47.263
I know who I need to know.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.686
That's a very small stone.

19:49.773 --> 19:56.315
Your savant surgeon says Moya
won't be able to Starburst
for some time.

19:56.404 --> 20:02.274
I'm, uh... interested in
securing other passage.

20:04.996 --> 20:07.783
There are some excellent
choices available.

20:07.874 --> 20:13.210
It depends whether you require
speed, stealth or strength.

20:13.296 --> 20:15.412
That's another very small stone.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.800
All three.

20:20.512 --> 20:23.174
That's not impossible.

20:23.264 --> 20:26.301
That's ah, three very
small stones.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.106
Oh.

20:39.197 --> 20:41.153
Splendid.

20:41.241 --> 20:42.777
Zhaan, what's happening?

20:42.867 --> 20:47.156
They're treating one more tier,
then the Diagnosan wants you.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.783
Great.

20:49.457 --> 20:51.243
Zhaan, listen.

20:51.334 --> 20:52.494
Yes, John.

20:52.585 --> 20:56.123
Odds are that I'm not
going to make it.

20:56.214 --> 20:59.331
Positive spirits.
I pray to the goddess.

20:59.426 --> 21:02.884
Yes, but reality tells me...

21:03.888 --> 21:06.174
Your soul is troubled.

21:07.434 --> 21:10.016
When the chip's not
controlling me,

21:10.103 --> 21:14.062
my thoughts are lucid.

21:14.149 --> 21:20.145
There are so many things that
I want to say to my family
and friends.

21:23.283 --> 21:26.946
If you could absorb
these thoughts.

21:27.036 --> 21:31.655
We could find a way to get a
message back to Earth.

21:31.749 --> 21:34.456
You want me to join
with you in Unity?

21:36.629 --> 21:39.166
I just want my dad to know.

21:47.599 --> 21:49.885
Concentrate on me.

21:57.108 --> 21:59.690
Hello, Delvian.

21:59.777 --> 22:02.154
Tenth Level Pa'u?

22:02.238 --> 22:03.489
Pity.

22:03.573 --> 22:06.485
A Twelfth could break
this bond.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.651
Time to pray.

22:12.290 --> 22:16.203
( screams )

22:16.294 --> 22:21.129
Crais:
Unlike your institutional
upbringing, my parents were compassionate.

22:21.216 --> 22:23.252
Moral, emotional.

22:23.343 --> 22:24.708
I value those traits.

22:24.802 --> 22:27.544
They're beginning to
emerge in you.

22:27.639 --> 22:30.756
Crichton may not survive.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.262
Moya may be permanently
crippled.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.969
The others are contemplating
their next move.

22:36.064 --> 22:38.225
You're an officer
and a strategist.

22:38.316 --> 22:41.149
Have you not planned yours?

22:41.236 --> 22:43.693
Sounds like you have
a suggestion.

22:43.780 --> 22:50.572
This ship, this emotional ship,
needs guidance.

22:51.329 --> 22:54.287
Talyn has chosen you.

22:55.375 --> 22:58.833
And I agree with his choice.

22:58.920 --> 23:02.287
There is much that you can
learn that will surprise you.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.964
( beeping )
What?

23:05.051 --> 23:06.837
How?
( beeping )

23:06.928 --> 23:10.295
It's Crichton.
Relay us to Pilot.

23:10.390 --> 23:12.847
Crichton, why won't you
frelling answer?

23:12.934 --> 23:15.016
Aeryn, don't come after
me, I'm not in...

23:15.103 --> 23:16.092
control.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.178
You will not shoot
him down, Talyn.

23:18.273 --> 23:20.764
Crichton is broadcasting our
location to Scorpius again.

23:20.858 --> 23:23.190
He must be stopped.

23:23.278 --> 23:24.518
Track me.

23:25.446 --> 23:26.982
Oh, and Crais...

23:28.533 --> 23:30.444
Thank you.

23:31.995 --> 23:34.361
Yee-haw!

23:40.295 --> 23:42.081
Shielded message for Scorpius.

23:42.171 --> 23:45.163
Coordinates on
specified frequency.

23:45.258 --> 23:47.214
Request immediate extraction.

23:47.302 --> 23:51.511
Crais:
Talyn, block and fragment
his transmission as best as possible.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.804
Buy her some time.

23:52.890 --> 23:55.017
John Crichton to Scorpius.

23:55.101 --> 23:57.843
Limited flight capabilities due
to the nature of this craft.

23:57.937 --> 24:01.771
Repeat, request immediate
extraction.

24:01.858 --> 24:03.974
You just called yourself
John Crichton.

24:04.068 --> 24:05.649
Are you really John anymore?

24:05.737 --> 24:09.275
Ah, little lady.

24:09.365 --> 24:10.741
How's the skull fracture?

24:10.825 --> 24:13.191
Well, if I'm not addressing
Crichton

24:13.286 --> 24:16.028
then I address the neuro-chip
in his head.

24:16.122 --> 24:17.111
At your service.

24:17.206 --> 24:19.197
You're in an unarmed vessel.

24:19.292 --> 24:22.329
I believe Scorpius's mandate is
for Crichton to remain alive.

24:22.420 --> 24:24.456
And I intend to see
that he does.

24:24.547 --> 24:27.209
You've given no other choices.
I will shoot you down.

24:27.300 --> 24:29.291
Oh, I doubt it.

24:29.385 --> 24:30.465
Make no mistake.

24:30.553 --> 24:33.135
I believe you'll
pull the trigger.

24:33.222 --> 24:34.803
I just don't believe...

24:34.891 --> 24:36.722
you'll hit anything.

24:41.439 --> 24:45.432
Focus. Regain your place.
Purge the memory.
-No... Crichton...

24:45.526 --> 24:47.232
Stark, he is no more.

24:47.320 --> 24:50.107
His body shelters some
horrific evil.

24:50.198 --> 24:52.689
Crichton... Crichton's gone.

24:58.956 --> 25:01.242
Now, this is flying!

25:02.877 --> 25:04.993
How's the ride back there, hmm?

25:05.088 --> 25:06.168
A little bumpy?

25:06.255 --> 25:08.337
Weapons locked to your exhaust.

25:08.424 --> 25:11.291
I give you one last chance
to stand down.

25:11.386 --> 25:13.502
Ah, the radiant Miss Officious.

25:13.596 --> 25:15.006
So sure.

25:15.098 --> 25:17.134
So confident in the
void of space.

25:17.225 --> 25:21.559
Crichton was trained to fly in
atmosphere, against gravity.

25:21.646 --> 25:24.308
Welcome to our world, baby!

25:28.444 --> 25:32.983
Aeryn, Crichton has often said
he'd rather die than
fall to Scorpius.

25:33.074 --> 25:36.362
If you've got the opportunity,
don't hesitate.

25:36.452 --> 25:37.953
What makes you think I would?

25:38.037 --> 25:41.154
Because if our positions
were reversed,

25:41.249 --> 25:42.580
I would.

25:44.335 --> 25:46.496
As Crichton might say...

25:46.587 --> 25:50.125
Yee-ha!!!

25:55.054 --> 25:58.421
Where the frell am I?

26:05.523 --> 26:07.354
(other ship's engine roaring)

26:09.736 --> 26:12.068
Lose your dance partner?

26:18.369 --> 26:21.953
You don't have enough fuel to
last until Scorpius gets here.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.166
Depends on how close he is.

26:24.250 --> 26:27.742
Look, John, if you're even
in there anymore,

26:27.837 --> 26:29.168
look at what you're doing.

26:29.255 --> 26:34.670
You fail to understand the
extent of your friend's misery.

26:34.761 --> 26:37.218
He wants Scorpius to find us.

26:37.305 --> 26:39.341
He wants to end his pain.

26:39.432 --> 26:41.297
No.

26:41.392 --> 26:43.348
I'll never believe that.

26:44.896 --> 26:46.432
Look, Crichton,

26:46.522 --> 26:49.229
Scorpius, whatever you are,

26:49.317 --> 26:53.401
recognize, atmosphere included,
I am the superior combat pilot.

26:53.488 --> 26:55.228
Darling, uncontested.

26:55.323 --> 26:57.279
So land your craft now

26:57.366 --> 27:00.153
or I shall be forced to
demonstrate that skill.

27:00.244 --> 27:03.077
You really would shoot your
friend down, wouldn't you?

27:03.164 --> 27:04.199
You know the answer.

27:04.290 --> 27:07.202
Well then, I shall comply.

27:07.960 --> 27:10.167
Lowering landing gear.

27:11.088 --> 27:12.669
Officer Sun, trust nothing.

27:12.757 --> 27:14.213
Oh, hush Crais.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.837
She doesn't need you
to tell her that.

27:16.928 --> 27:18.384
Descending now.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.300
Terribly sorry.

27:22.391 --> 27:25.258
Didn't see you there.

27:25.353 --> 27:29.062
Aeryn:
I am under attack! I repeat,
I am under attack!

27:29.148 --> 27:30.308
Aeryn.

27:30.399 --> 27:33.687
Aeryn!
-Attempting to gain
ejection altitude.

27:33.778 --> 27:36.520
I take it our encounter is
terminated, Officer Sun.

27:36.614 --> 27:39.447
All options depleted.
Requesting position track.

27:39.534 --> 27:41.820
Climb! Eject!
-Requesting position track.

27:41.911 --> 27:44.493
Ejecting now!

27:47.542 --> 27:48.577
(gasping)

27:50.378 --> 27:53.245
Well done, Officer Sun!

27:53.339 --> 27:54.624
(chuckling)

27:54.715 --> 27:56.091
Are you still conscious?

27:56.175 --> 27:57.460
Frell you.

28:00.012 --> 28:02.970
Ooh. Fireworks.

28:03.057 --> 28:04.558
Aeryn.

28:04.642 --> 28:05.973
Aeryn!

28:06.060 --> 28:07.140
Aeryn:
It's all right, D'Argo.

28:07.228 --> 28:10.265
The descent brakes
auto-ignited. I'm all right.

28:10.356 --> 28:15.146
Crichton:
Officer Sun, in deference to
that part of Crichton which still cares,

28:15.236 --> 28:20.151
I inform you that you descend
not over solid ground,

28:20.241 --> 28:22.323
but a frozen lake.

28:24.871 --> 28:26.077
He's right.

28:26.163 --> 28:27.664
D'Argo, Crais, do you
have my position?

28:27.748 --> 28:30.330
Affirmative.
-|'ve got you, Aeryn.
Can you avoid it?

28:30.418 --> 28:33.160
Negative. I go down where this
chair takes me down.

28:33.254 --> 28:34.585
Crais:
Yourjets will weaken the ice.

28:34.672 --> 28:37.004
I suggest separate
before touchdown.

28:37.091 --> 28:39.127
I repeat, separate
before touchdown!

28:39.218 --> 28:41.675
Officer Sun...

28:41.762 --> 28:45.254
(vocal pattern breaking up )

28:45.349 --> 28:46.600
( screaming )

28:46.684 --> 28:48.470
Aeryn, can you comply?

28:48.561 --> 28:51.223
Negative.
The harness is jammed.

28:51.314 --> 28:54.021
Your frelling tire must have
damaged the mechanism.

28:54.108 --> 28:55.473
Aeryn, listen to me.
This is John. It's John.

28:55.568 --> 28:57.684
Yeah, is it really you, John?
-Yes, listen to me.

28:57.778 --> 29:00.235
You do not want to be in that
chair when you set down.

29:00.323 --> 29:03.565
Well, this harness
won't release.

29:03.659 --> 29:05.320
I don't have anything
to break it.

29:05.411 --> 29:08.323
Aeryn, you have to get out
of the damn chair.

29:08.414 --> 29:10.120
I don't have any choice.

29:10.207 --> 29:12.368
Come on, please. Do something.
Do something.

29:15.046 --> 29:17.162
I don't have any options.

29:18.382 --> 29:19.758
Baby, you're not gonna
die like this.

29:19.842 --> 29:21.548
You are not going to
die like this.

29:24.805 --> 29:28.468
I hope you meant what you said
in the neural cluster.

29:30.269 --> 29:31.384
ldid.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.024
No!!!

29:43.115 --> 29:44.366
( screaming )

29:44.450 --> 29:46.611
Aeryn!

29:57.838 --> 29:59.248
Crichton!

29:59.340 --> 30:00.375
Cri...

30:26.409 --> 30:29.321
Oh... God.

30:32.289 --> 30:34.746
What have I done?

30:43.801 --> 30:47.293
The goddess graciously
receives to her bosom

30:47.388 --> 30:50.505
all those who pass from
this existence

30:50.599 --> 30:54.808
regardless of faith or belief.

30:54.895 --> 30:59.138
She holds, however,
a special place

30:59.233 --> 31:04.227
for those who travel this
life as a journey.

31:04.864 --> 31:07.321
Aeryn Sun...

31:08.325 --> 31:11.408
will surely harvest a favor.

31:13.330 --> 31:18.620
Her life was a series of
strides toward enlightenment.

31:20.337 --> 31:26.674
Casting off the chains of
prejudice and hatred...

31:28.345 --> 31:34.011
reaching beyond violence
and bigotry

31:35.394 --> 31:40.605
she sought a balance of
lasting inner peace.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.438
In her name.

32:12.473 --> 32:16.136
You are more worthy of this.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.773
At peace, Aeryn.

32:36.664 --> 32:39.280
Zhaan:
May the goddess receive
you with charity.

32:41.544 --> 32:44.206
May the goddess sanctify
your spirit.

32:44.296 --> 32:46.378
Ament.

32:47.091 --> 32:49.207
Ament.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.259
Zhaan:
May the goddess purify
yoursoul

32:54.723 --> 32:59.057
May the goddess recite your
name in the whispers
of the wind.

32:59.145 --> 33:01.227
Group:
Amet.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.816
Amet.

33:27.840 --> 33:30.297
D'Argo, give me your knife.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.890
Give me...

33:36.974 --> 33:38.384
your knife.

33:47.276 --> 33:48.891
(knife clinks)

34:08.422 --> 34:12.131
Aeryn, forgive me.

34:13.427 --> 34:15.213
I love you.

34:43.540 --> 34:45.451
I'm ready.

34:46.001 --> 34:48.037
( exhales )

34:49.213 --> 34:51.249
( instrument beeps and twangs)

34:57.346 --> 34:59.211
( instrument squeals)

35:07.940 --> 35:10.431
Are you sure you don't want
your friends here?

35:11.652 --> 35:13.438
No, I don't want 'em here.

35:13.529 --> 35:16.692
(speaks alien language)

35:18.284 --> 35:20.275
The Doc says, 'cause of that
thing in your brain,

35:20.369 --> 35:24.783
there's no way that you are
responsible for what happened
to that Sebacean.

35:24.873 --> 35:26.158
Yes, lam.

35:26.250 --> 35:30.414
(speaks alien language)

35:30.504 --> 35:32.119
Right.

35:34.842 --> 35:39.302
After the Doc's cut the tendrils
that have hijacked your brain,

35:39.388 --> 35:42.926
he's going to try and take out
the neuro-chip completely.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.224
But he needs your help.

35:47.104 --> 35:48.594
What do I got to do?

35:48.689 --> 35:52.807
Because there is no template
of your brain pattern on
our database,

35:52.901 --> 35:57.144
he doesn't what bits
of gray do what.

35:57.239 --> 36:01.232
So, when he probes,
you tell him.

36:02.244 --> 36:04.485
Right.

36:04.580 --> 36:06.286
Where will you be?

36:06.373 --> 36:08.580
Anywhere else.

36:08.667 --> 36:11.079
I vomit when things get messy.

36:13.714 --> 36:15.295
( beeping )

36:15.382 --> 36:17.293
Yes, Talyn.

36:17.384 --> 36:26.725
I, too would have liked to have
shown Aeryn what we learned
from this chip.

36:30.314 --> 36:32.430
lthink...

36:34.693 --> 36:40.814
I think it could have made her
the happiest soul among us.

36:48.582 --> 36:51.949
Everyone else is
preparing to move on.

36:53.045 --> 36:56.879
I know. Tragedy often
heralds flight.

36:57.966 --> 37:00.378
What are you going
to do, Zhaan?

37:00.469 --> 37:03.927
My concern, now, is for
Moya and Pilot.

37:06.517 --> 37:10.180
If you are in agreement,
Pa'u Zotoh Zhann,

37:10.270 --> 37:16.891
it would be honor and a
pleasure to share the
future with you.

37:18.654 --> 37:20.190
( exhales )

37:20.280 --> 37:22.942
( instrument buzzes )

37:23.033 --> 37:26.150
This is what?

37:29.039 --> 37:30.199
Critters.

37:30.290 --> 37:32.417
More close encounters.

37:34.253 --> 37:36.335
And this?

37:37.923 --> 37:40.756
American politics,
Nixon to Clinton.

37:41.593 --> 37:42.969
Lose it.

37:46.014 --> 37:47.345
Here?

37:49.560 --> 37:51.801
All of my dogs.

37:51.895 --> 37:54.147
Necessary?

37:54.231 --> 37:58.270
No, but keep it if you can.

37:58.360 --> 38:02.194
The ship that you want, it'll
be on its way here shortly.

38:02.281 --> 38:03.942
Thank you.

38:04.032 --> 38:07.775
( sighs )
Service paid, service
rendered, I guess.

38:07.870 --> 38:09.861
( chuckles )

38:11.415 --> 38:13.076
Too bad, eh?

38:13.709 --> 38:17.122
Yes, but that's life.

38:18.088 --> 38:19.669
Yeah.

38:23.760 --> 38:26.251
This... section?

38:37.274 --> 38:40.311
Keep this?

38:45.574 --> 38:49.283
Jothee:
It's too bad we don't get to
spend more time together.

38:51.079 --> 38:52.785
Yeah.

38:52.873 --> 38:56.786
My whole life, I never stayed
in one place long enough to

38:56.877 --> 38:59.084
build any real relationships.

39:01.381 --> 39:03.758
And I always stayed too long.

39:20.317 --> 39:21.898
D'Argo:
Jothee.

39:22.236 --> 39:23.726
Chiana.

39:28.450 --> 39:31.192
Let's stay close.

39:31.286 --> 39:34.403
Once we find out about John we
should discuss our future.

39:35.415 --> 39:36.621
Sure, Dad.

39:43.549 --> 39:44.880
Whoa!

39:44.967 --> 39:46.923
Worm holes. That's it.

39:47.010 --> 39:48.716
Good job...

39:48.804 --> 39:50.590
...from you.

39:50.681 --> 39:52.717
( laughs )

39:52.808 --> 39:55.800
I should desist?

39:55.894 --> 39:58.135
No frellin' way.

40:01.567 --> 40:03.057
Braca:
Here!

40:03.694 --> 40:04.774
Down there!

40:04.861 --> 40:07.318
(speaking gibberish )

40:10.742 --> 40:12.698
What the frell was that?!

40:15.664 --> 40:17.200
Return to the Marauder.

40:17.291 --> 40:20.749
Inform Scorpius we have
successfully maintained our
zero presence profile.

40:20.836 --> 40:22.246
Now!

40:23.922 --> 40:26.334
Very bad...

40:26.425 --> 40:31.419
speech close to neural implant.

40:31.513 --> 40:35.347
You're gonna take my
memories and I'm gonna
talk gibberish?

40:35.434 --> 40:38.892
Why not just take my mojo
while you're at it?

40:38.979 --> 40:41.220
Remove chip...

40:41.315 --> 40:45.183
then attempt replace...

40:45.277 --> 40:48.565
you normal.

40:48.655 --> 40:50.191
What the hell.

40:51.617 --> 40:55.326
( Crichton sighs)
There's no one I really
want to talk to.

40:55.412 --> 40:57.152
Not much worth remembering.

40:57.247 --> 40:59.624
(device whines)

41:02.419 --> 41:04.410
Take the damn thing out.

41:26.485 --> 41:29.773
(speaking gibberish )

41:30.405 --> 41:33.738
I remove...

41:33.825 --> 41:37.488
then restore you.

41:37.579 --> 41:42.118
( laughs )

42:13.115 --> 42:15.356
Very clever, Greenschlick.

42:22.499 --> 42:28.460
Accomplished... chip... removal.

42:28.547 --> 42:32.210
Now... replace... brain.

42:32.300 --> 42:36.213
(humming Star
Spangled Banner)

42:40.517 --> 42:42.553
Hello, Doctor.

42:42.644 --> 42:44.145
So good to see you again.

42:44.229 --> 42:45.560
(speaking gibberish )

42:45.647 --> 42:47.228
(speaking alien language)

42:47.315 --> 42:49.306
Oh, no, quite the
contrary, really.

42:49.401 --> 42:55.146
Uh, my, uh, cooling apparatus
is just as functional as the
day you installed it.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.231
Eternal thanks.

42:57.325 --> 43:02.240
Oh, I am so sorry to disturb
the, uh sterility of your
theater, but, uh...

43:02.330 --> 43:03.240
(gasping)

43:03.331 --> 43:04.662
You no longer serve a purpose.

43:04.750 --> 43:06.536
( exhales )

43:13.425 --> 43:15.507
(moaning)

43:16.178 --> 43:18.294
What irony.

43:18.388 --> 43:20.800
Sensitivity to heal anything.

43:22.309 --> 43:24.345
But oneself.

43:25.437 --> 43:28.304
(speaking gibberish )

43:29.149 --> 43:30.889
Well, Crichton,

43:32.235 --> 43:34.317
so much to say.

43:34.404 --> 43:36.781
(speaking gibberish )

43:36.865 --> 43:41.234
And yet such little capacity.

43:41.328 --> 43:45.446
(speaking gibberish )

43:47.250 --> 43:49.787
I only hope...

43:49.878 --> 43:53.541
the wormhole technology I
waited so patiently for
makes more sense.

43:53.632 --> 43:57.466
(speaking gibberish )

43:57.552 --> 44:00.043
Don't need a translator microbe
for that one, do we?

44:02.182 --> 44:03.922
(sighs)

44:09.105 --> 44:11.938
You've cost me much.

44:12.025 --> 44:14.732
And I do not suffer
disappointment well.

44:17.447 --> 44:20.234
I condemn you, John Crichton...

44:21.034 --> 44:23.525
to live.

44:23.620 --> 44:28.284
So that your thirst for
unfulfilled revenge

44:28.375 --> 44:30.457
will consume you.

44:47.561 --> 44:49.347
Goodbye.

44:52.732 --> 44:55.439
( screaming )
