00:18.943 --> 00:21.069
Liam Foxwell, welcome.

00:21.081 --> 00:22.387
Thank you.

00:22.401 --> 00:23.906
OK, little speech time.

00:23.963 --> 00:26.637
I've mentioned this to
everyone about their appraisals,

00:26.762 --> 00:30.383
and I just want you to know that this
isn't a witch-hunt for the deadwood.

00:30.443 --> 00:32.023
It is much more of a...

00:33.483 --> 00:35.477
treasure hunt for the gold?

00:36.337 --> 00:37.655
Shit sinks.

00:38.040 --> 00:39.437
But also, cream floats.

00:39.562 --> 00:41.199
Yes, yes, I see that.

00:41.243 --> 00:44.014
A new the area we're
getting lots of play in ...

00:44.027 --> 00:46.438
and your office could
be at the centre for ...

00:46.463 --> 00:49.877
is litigation in
retrospective parenting cases.

00:50.002 --> 00:51.164
Retrospective...

00:51.189 --> 00:53.990
Bobby sues Mum and Dad
for insufficient attention

00:54.002 --> 00:57.803
leading to lack of confidence,
leading to damages against earnings.

00:57.828 --> 01:01.716
Right, and we're OK,
the firm's OK with that, ethically?

01:01.841 --> 01:03.237
And morally?

01:06.763 --> 01:07.971
Yep.

01:07.983 --> 01:09.018
Mm-hmm.

01:09.031 --> 01:10.077
Sure.

01:10.483 --> 01:11.889
Yeah, yeah, right.

01:12.483 --> 01:13.550
Are you?

01:14.259 --> 01:15.590
Totally, yeah.

01:17.281 --> 01:18.637
Yes.

01:19.851 --> 01:21.454
OK, Liam, look,

01:21.455 --> 01:25.091
so if we invite you to stay with
the firm in the new environment,

01:25.862 --> 01:28.274
what we'd have you do is
pull an exhaustive redo

01:28.275 --> 01:30.346
with personnel, maybe... next week.

01:30.620 --> 01:33.797
Oh, well, I was ready to do
a big redo right now, but...

01:33.922 --> 01:35.977
No, it's fine, next week's fine.

01:36.102 --> 01:39.822
But I have to ask you this ...
they're not going to hit anything

01:39.847 --> 01:41.787
to freak us out, are they?

01:42.412 --> 01:44.663
There's no major
deletions this quarter?

01:44.687 --> 01:47.647
No, no, everything's
well within... parameters.

01:48.523 --> 01:51.419
Great, OK, Liam,
this has been really great.

01:51.544 --> 01:52.588
Um...

01:53.123 --> 01:58.247
Look, really hope to... look
forward to seeing you again.

02:02.883 --> 02:04.194
OK, thank you.

Sorry!

03:43.360 --> 03:44.361
BLEEP

03:47.184 --> 03:48.564
Mr Foxwell.

03:48.689 --> 03:52.353
Could you just rewind me
your last 24 hours for me, please?

04:01.360 --> 04:04.509
Great, and back that up for me
times 64 for the week.

04:10.827 --> 04:12.159
That's great.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.886
Enjoy your flight, Mr Foxwell.

04:17.723 --> 04:20.027
I'm not being funny,
right, but look at that.

04:21.183 --> 04:22.589
Look at what?

04:22.600 --> 04:23.899
That!

04:23.900 --> 04:26.436
Frayed carpet, there, you see?

04:26.437 --> 04:27.743
Seriously?

04:27.767 --> 04:29.357
Yes, seriously!

04:29.807 --> 04:31.519
This is a five-star suite.

04:32.211 --> 04:34.375
I pay good money
to have perfect details.

04:34.803 --> 04:38.479
Now I've got that shitty
carpet for the rest of my life.

04:38.480 --> 04:40.559
Only if you keep looking at it,
mate.

04:40.956 --> 04:42.460
Oh, thanks, Jonas!

04:42.871 --> 04:43.928
Fuck off.

04:45.084 --> 04:49.534
All right, now, you thought the
carpet was bad, have a look at this.

04:54.014 --> 04:57.557
You've met Lucy, my wife,
at the Dublin wedding?

04:57.682 --> 04:59.573
Oh, that's right, yes, hi, Liam.

04:59.958 --> 05:01.525
Hi... Hi again.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.434
(Lucy, Dublin.)

05:06.174 --> 05:07.492
Hello.

05:07.617 --> 05:10.029
Lucy ... Liam,
we met at the Dublin wedding.

05:10.303 --> 05:11.599
Liam!

05:11.600 --> 05:12.905
Oh, great.

05:13.204 --> 05:14.479
Liam, yes.

05:14.759 --> 05:16.239
Come in.
Thank you.

05:18.228 --> 05:20.693
- Great to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.119
Where's Fi been hiding you?

05:24.120 --> 05:26.037
Oh, you know, in our house.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.065
(LAUGHS)

05:27.078 --> 05:30.262
We didn't know ... well, she didn't
know if you would make it.

05:30.275 --> 05:32.115
It was over quicker than I thought.

05:33.032 --> 05:34.860
Oh, sorry, hello.

05:34.885 --> 05:37.829
Let's get you a drink.
Um, beer OK?

05:37.954 --> 05:39.533
Lovely, thank you.

05:41.680 --> 05:45.694
Everyone's through there,
so I'll be in in a minute, OK?

05:45.719 --> 05:46.814
OK, thank you.

05:58.110 --> 05:59.119
Hi.

06:00.763 --> 06:03.743
You're back early, then,
I didn't think you'd make it.

06:03.868 --> 06:07.424
Yeah, I didn't stay over and I
caught an early flight back, so...

06:07.549 --> 06:08.833
- Hi.
- Hello.

06:10.195 --> 06:11.755
So, how was the appraisal?

06:11.777 --> 06:15.319
Well, they said they'd let me do
a redo sometime next week, so...

06:15.580 --> 06:17.047
Oh.
But good?

06:17.508 --> 06:18.521
Well...

06:19.278 --> 06:20.585
- Later?
- Later.

06:20.598 --> 06:21.606
OK.

06:21.874 --> 06:24.734
- How's Jody?
- At home, Gina's babysitting.

06:24.859 --> 06:26.166
Hey.

06:26.291 --> 06:27.434
Jonas, this is...

06:27.459 --> 06:29.457
- Liam ...
- Jonas.

06:29.458 --> 06:31.479
Dude, it's really nice to meet you.

06:31.480 --> 06:33.679
- You all right?
- Good, thank you.

06:33.680 --> 06:35.351
- And you know Jeff?
- Yes.

06:35.376 --> 06:38.484
Yeah, you remember meeting Jeff,
because he'd have shown you,

06:38.497 --> 06:41.478
I don't know, a redo
of the side of his fridge.

06:41.603 --> 06:43.494
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
piss off, Jonas.

06:43.518 --> 06:44.824
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:44.825 --> 06:46.976
Your wife's being
very mean to me tonight.

06:47.001 --> 06:48.199
Oh, well she's like that.

06:48.200 --> 06:49.606
Yeah, tell me about it.

06:50.079 --> 06:53.113
- You all right for a drink?
- I'm fine, thank you, Jonas.

06:54.021 --> 06:57.325
Lynn, come and meet Liam, he's, um...

06:58.842 --> 07:01.639
A soon-to-be
unemployed/unemployable lawyer.

07:01.640 --> 07:02.683
(LAUGHS)

07:04.284 --> 07:05.625
And Jeff.

07:06.328 --> 07:07.963
Jeff and Fi...

07:08.200 --> 07:11.439
used to run the parties down
the Fraser Road with Paul and me.

07:11.907 --> 07:13.225
Mad old days.

07:14.262 --> 07:15.917
Before we started up the Kings.

07:17.321 --> 07:18.837
So, yeah...

07:20.722 --> 07:24.635
So, Liam, what was it you had,
an assessment?

07:24.652 --> 07:25.962
Appraisal.

07:25.963 --> 07:27.239
How'd it go?

07:27.240 --> 07:28.637
Good.

07:28.762 --> 07:32.873
Well, it was a disaster,
but you know, I don't know.

07:32.890 --> 07:34.232
- Hard to gauge?
- Yeah

07:34.240 --> 07:35.525
Let's have a look.

07:35.604 --> 07:37.740
Redo, we can
appraise the appraisal.

07:38.963 --> 07:40.277
Yeah, great.

07:40.402 --> 07:42.411
Throw it up there
and we can grade you.

07:42.747 --> 07:44.550
- Come on.
- Um...

07:44.575 --> 07:46.677
It could be fun, we could, um...

07:46.695 --> 07:47.727
vote!

07:48.520 --> 07:49.885
- Paul?
- Yeah?

07:49.963 --> 07:52.995
I work in recruitment,
so it might be quite useful for you.

07:52.998 --> 07:53.601
Right, OK.

07:53.602 --> 07:56.275
Liam's redoing his
appraisal so we can give him marks.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.397
- Notes.
- Pointers, you know.

07:58.415 --> 08:00.679
- I think Liam would probably...
- Yes, do you know what...

08:00.680 --> 08:03.843
Guys, no, come on,
seriously, that's not cool,

08:03.855 --> 08:06.319
I mean Liam's
obviously uncomfortable,

08:06.320 --> 08:08.599
so let's just drop it, yeah?

08:09.609 --> 08:10.940
Have a cool time.

08:12.805 --> 08:14.119
Time to eat!

08:14.120 --> 08:15.566
Oh, it's ready.

08:19.387 --> 08:21.824
Thank you so much
for inviting us this evening.

08:21.849 --> 08:24.672
It's been too long, too long.

08:25.175 --> 08:26.518
Fi.

08:28.643 --> 08:31.309
I haven't met him before, have I?
Jonas, is it?

08:31.434 --> 08:33.039
He's one of the old crowd.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.631
I think I said.

08:36.071 --> 08:37.578
- You OK?
- Yeah, yeah.

08:37.583 --> 08:40.880
- You know, if you're not in the mood,
we can go. - No, no, I'm fine.

08:40.905 --> 08:41.913
Sure?

08:56.800 --> 09:00.799
QUIETLY TALKING AND LAUGHING

09:01.600 --> 09:02.618
Hey!

09:02.643 --> 09:04.643
Sync and corrected by APOLLO
www.addic7ed.com

09:09.049 --> 09:11.888
Yeah! I brought enough
for others to share.

09:11.890 --> 09:13.049
Thank you.

09:13.050 --> 09:16.209
I've, er, been cooking a lot
since the break-up.

09:16.210 --> 09:18.129
Jonas has had a tough one.

09:18.130 --> 09:19.369
DOORBELL RINGS

09:19.370 --> 09:20.609
Was it bad?

09:20.610 --> 09:22.850
Er, yeah.

09:22.883 --> 09:25.685
Yeah, erm, we were in the middle
of planning is all

09:25.710 --> 09:29.863
and I suddenly realised that
the less the relationship means

09:29.881 --> 09:31.883
the more you spend
on the wedding, you know!

09:31.908 --> 09:32.929
(LAUGHS)

09:32.930 --> 09:35.449
You actually start obsessing over
the tiniest little details,

09:35.450 --> 09:38.489
like the thickness
of the wedding invitation paper

09:38.490 --> 09:42.750
because, I mean, God knows you need
something to fucking talk about!

09:42.803 --> 09:45.627
So, everybody, this is Helen.

09:46.274 --> 09:48.002
Helen, Jonas.

09:48.127 --> 09:49.525
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.611
And everyone!

09:52.349 --> 09:54.285
(ALL) - Hi!
- Help yourself.

09:54.311 --> 09:57.209
Jonas was just explaining why
relationships are a sham.

09:57.210 --> 09:58.809
Are they? Shit!

09:59.561 --> 10:01.912
They're like going
to the theatre, OK?

10:02.037 --> 10:06.169
You pay loads to go and ultimately
you are wasting your entire night,

10:06.170 --> 10:09.289
so, when someone asks you,
"Did you have a good time?",

10:09.290 --> 10:13.289
you both say,
"Yeah! Yeah, it was great."

10:13.307 --> 10:15.437
The problem is the
more that you pay

10:15.445 --> 10:19.649
and the longer it goes on, the more
you're, "Oh, yeah, we loved it!",

10:19.690 --> 10:23.449
you know, "We love being together
and never fucking anyone else"

10:23.450 --> 10:25.527
"and only just having
one other person"

10:25.530 --> 10:30.845
"to share our real thoughts with for
our entire lives, yeah, it's great!"

10:30.868 --> 10:32.962
Would you say you loved her, though?

10:36.148 --> 10:40.835
I just think we just really fancied
each other and that was what it was.

10:40.847 --> 10:42.273
You know what it's like early on.

10:42.290 --> 10:44.409
You know, we were just,
I don't know,

10:44.410 --> 10:46.569
we were just two tools
in the tool shed

10:46.570 --> 10:48.289
that just fit together
really fucking well.

10:48.290 --> 10:52.925
I mean, still, by the end, I'd
be like, "Go on, honey, you go up,"

10:52.926 --> 10:55.129
"I'm just going to watch
a little bit more of the news"

10:55.130 --> 10:57.728
and I'd find myself, you know,
watching redos of, like,

10:57.730 --> 10:59.849
hot times in earlier relationships!

10:59.850 --> 11:01.162
Easy!

11:01.883 --> 11:04.578
I'm just saying, there's
a beautiful woman upstairs,

11:04.603 --> 11:05.974
you know, waiting
to have sex with me.

11:05.949 --> 11:07.236
What, right now?

11:07.250 --> 11:10.725
(THEY LAUGH)

11:10.746 --> 11:13.889
She's upstairs, you know,
waiting to have sex with me

11:13.890 --> 11:17.889
and I'm sat downstairs watching
redos of, like, some hot times

11:18.169 --> 11:21.762
with some hot girl that I just
picked up in some place

11:21.763 --> 11:25.680
and I'm fucking pulling
myself off. I mean, seriously?

11:28.403 --> 11:29.741
Oh, come on...

11:30.290 --> 11:32.409
Come on, guys.

11:32.410 --> 11:34.169
I mean, we all scroll
through the Grain

11:34.170 --> 11:35.769
rifling through our greatest hits

11:35.770 --> 11:38.845
for a little bit of filth
now and then, surely?

11:38.970 --> 11:40.271
Not me.

11:42.347 --> 11:44.312
Helen doesn't have a Grain!

11:45.403 --> 11:47.205
- Oh, wow!
- Wow!

11:47.477 --> 11:48.869
No shit!

11:49.130 --> 11:51.169
Was that a political thing?

11:51.170 --> 11:53.689
No, no, I was gouged
about 12 months ago.

11:53.690 --> 11:56.169
Jesus, was that painful?

11:56.170 --> 11:58.409
Total agony.

11:58.410 --> 12:01.209
But on the plus of that, I don't
remember it that clearly.

12:01.210 --> 12:02.729
There's a scar on here.

12:03.385 --> 12:05.164
Yeah, can I, er...?

12:17.330 --> 12:18.569
Yeah, that feels quite nice.

12:18.570 --> 12:20.129
Yeah, that feels quite nice.
(THEY CHUCKLE)

12:20.130 --> 12:22.929
Yeah, no brain damage, clearly!

12:22.930 --> 12:26.187
Well, my sight held on fine, so...

12:26.312 --> 12:28.009
So, who took it then?

12:28.010 --> 12:30.329
Stolen to order,
as far as they could tell,

12:30.330 --> 12:33.689
probably to some millionaire
Chinese perve.

12:33.690 --> 12:35.289
Really?! Yeah.

12:35.290 --> 12:36.969
Is that for real?

12:36.970 --> 12:39.049
Yeah, and none of
it was encrypted, so...

12:39.050 --> 12:41.049
So, they saw the lot!

12:41.050 --> 12:44.318
The thing is, after I was gouged
I didn't have one for a few days

12:44.443 --> 12:46.300
and then just kind of, liked it.

12:50.293 --> 12:51.529
It's cool.

12:51.530 --> 12:52.609
That's cool.

12:52.610 --> 12:54.769
I mean, because more people are...

12:54.770 --> 12:57.449
I mean, now, right?
Like, going Grainless?

12:57.450 --> 12:58.889
I believe it's huge with hookers.

12:58.890 --> 13:00.569
I mean, no offence!

13:00.570 --> 13:01.689
(THEY LAUGH)

13:01.690 --> 13:04.409
No, no, it's OK. Sure, I...

13:04.410 --> 13:06.627
Well, I'm pretty boring.
One man is a time.

13:06.752 --> 13:07.783
Boo!

13:09.126 --> 13:11.569
Serial monogamist.

13:11.570 --> 13:13.387
I'm a serial monogamist.

13:13.930 --> 13:16.129
I'm staying faithful
to my cornflakes right now!

13:16.130 --> 13:18.237
(LAUGHS)

13:20.261 --> 13:23.249
Well, I think it's an interesting
choice, going Grainless.

13:23.250 --> 13:24.409
It's a brave choice.

13:24.410 --> 13:26.167
I'm sorry, but I...

13:28.650 --> 13:30.169
I couldn't do it.

13:30.170 --> 13:31.653
Uh-huh.

13:34.210 --> 13:38.209
OK, I was going to play some redos
from the Fraser O days.

13:38.570 --> 13:39.649
(ALL) Yay!

13:39.650 --> 13:42.049
Stuff from last night,
depressing and fun.

13:42.785 --> 13:45.944
You know half the organic
memories you have a junk,

13:46.243 --> 13:47.565
just not trustworthy.

13:47.583 --> 13:49.329
Colleen works in Grain development.

13:49.330 --> 13:52.406
With half the population you can
implant false memories,

13:52.418 --> 13:54.756
just by asking leading
questions in therapy.

13:54.881 --> 13:57.280
You can make people
remember getting lost

13:57.293 --> 13:59.169
in shopping malls they
never visited,

13:59.170 --> 14:02.182
getting bothered by paedophile
babysitters they never had.

14:04.097 --> 14:06.175
I'm just happier now.

14:07.945 --> 14:09.104
TAPE REWINDING

14:09.410 --> 14:13.249
'OK, great, Liam, this has been,
this has been really great, erm...

14:13.250 --> 14:15.968
'we really hope to look
forward to seeing you again.'

14:15.976 --> 14:17.937
He looks forward to seeing
you again, that's good.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.369
"Hopes" to look forward.

14:19.370 --> 14:20.849
TAPE REWINDING

14:20.850 --> 14:24.009
'We really hope to look
forward to seeing you again.'

14:24.010 --> 14:25.314
It's phoney.

14:26.594 --> 14:27.974
Hang on.

14:27.975 --> 14:29.237
Pause it.

14:29.362 --> 14:30.772
Now backup.

14:31.610 --> 14:32.999
Zoom in there.

14:33.730 --> 14:35.289
Come on, that's a tick.

14:35.290 --> 14:36.849
That could be a V or an L.

14:36.850 --> 14:39.245
- It's a tick!
- Or the start of the swastika.

14:39.255 --> 14:42.661
It's probably the start of the
swastika, they were such pricks!

14:47.532 --> 14:50.205
- Did you have fun with the old gang?
- Yeah.

14:52.410 --> 14:54.089
D'you speak to that Jonas much?

14:54.090 --> 14:55.946
No, no, not really.

15:00.164 --> 15:01.880
He's a bit of a knob, ain't he?

15:01.893 --> 15:03.569
Bit of a dick?

15:03.570 --> 15:04.609
Jonas.

15:04.610 --> 15:08.169
Pulling himself off to his own
relationship theories.

15:08.170 --> 15:11.489
Oh, it must be such a drag,
Jonas, putting it about!

15:11.490 --> 15:14.209
And when he protected me
from those arseholes,

15:14.210 --> 15:16.049
"Hey, come on, guys,"

15:16.050 --> 15:18.729
"it's really not cool to redo
another man's appraisals, dudes."

15:18.730 --> 15:20.569
Then why invite him over?

15:20.570 --> 15:21.876
I like him.

15:27.850 --> 15:30.249
You wanted me to invite him.

15:30.250 --> 15:31.929
I didn't say anything.

15:31.930 --> 15:34.489
You were laughing
at everything he said.

15:34.490 --> 15:37.009
You invited him!

15:37.010 --> 15:39.348
It was obvious
I didn't want him to come.

15:41.569 --> 15:44.769
'Wow, it's only, it's early
to call it a night.'

15:44.771 --> 15:46.485
'Do fancy a quick one down the pub?'

15:46.496 --> 15:47.809
'Oh, we've got to get back,

15:47.810 --> 15:50.369
'rescue Jodie from
the paedophile babysitter!

15:50.370 --> 15:51.929
'(LAUGHS)'

15:51.942 --> 15:53.248
'Yeah.'

15:55.170 --> 15:59.009
'But why don't you come back to
ours, for a nightcap if you want?'

15:59.010 --> 16:00.049
See?

16:00.050 --> 16:04.306
It was obvious I didn't want him to
come, I was being polite to a moron.

16:04.431 --> 16:07.277
If you really don't want to come,
you can get rid of him.

16:19.280 --> 16:20.359
Hey, hey!

16:20.368 --> 16:21.432
Hey.

16:23.063 --> 16:25.262
Well, actually, what time is it?

16:25.301 --> 16:26.780
It's midnight.

16:26.797 --> 16:28.876
Shit, it's quite late,
time's gone on.

16:28.894 --> 16:30.893
(LAUGHS) Yeah, time does that.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.129
15 minutes.

16:32.130 --> 16:33.289
Yeah.

16:33.290 --> 16:36.317
But we've got the babysitter
inside, so...

16:36.442 --> 16:38.289
So, is that new info?

16:38.290 --> 16:42.289
No, it's just that we, I mean,
we thought, right, Fi?

16:42.570 --> 16:44.369
Yeah. Yeah.

16:44.370 --> 16:45.729
OK, no, I get it.

16:45.730 --> 16:47.849
No, it's just that, actually,
it turns out we're tired

16:47.850 --> 16:50.889
and I guess we forgot,
but now we've remembered, so...

16:50.890 --> 16:51.929
Sorry.

16:51.930 --> 16:52.769
No, it's fine, really.

16:52.770 --> 16:53.809
I'm sorry.

16:53.810 --> 16:56.369
Oh, it's cool, no worries.

16:56.370 --> 16:58.249
I've got a back-up plan, so...

16:58.250 --> 17:00.009
Oh, cool, well, we vote the back-up.

17:00.010 --> 17:01.449
Yeah, I will do.

17:01.450 --> 17:03.209
Er, see you later, Fi.

17:03.210 --> 17:04.368
It was good to meet you, man.

17:04.369 --> 17:05.381
Yeah.

17:05.810 --> 17:06.848
Nice one.

17:06.849 --> 17:08.270
Brilliant. Brilliant.

17:10.450 --> 17:11.759
OK, cool.

17:15.604 --> 17:16.922
Good to meet you, man.

17:17.047 --> 17:18.059
Yeah.

17:20.396 --> 17:24.128
Listen, Gina, it's a 40-minute
wait for a cab, but if you want,

17:24.250 --> 17:26.423
I have the bed made up in my office.

17:26.548 --> 17:27.865
Er... OK, thanks, Fi.

17:29.532 --> 17:33.529
Hey, there's just, you know, use
anything. There's T-shirts and...

17:33.654 --> 17:35.537
Yeah, thanks, I'll show myself out.

17:35.549 --> 17:36.569
All right, night.

17:36.570 --> 17:37.609
Night, guys.

17:37.610 --> 17:38.923
Night, Gina.

17:46.170 --> 17:47.544
Thank you.

17:49.029 --> 17:50.135
'Bye-bye.

17:50.160 --> 17:52.049
'OK.

17:52.050 --> 17:54.317
'Love you, love you.'

18:13.521 --> 18:15.489
Was he a big part of the gang?

18:15.490 --> 18:16.878
Who? Jonas?

18:18.890 --> 18:20.774
I don't know, yeah?

18:21.992 --> 18:24.889
Let me guess, he'd spent his time
oozing round the girls,

18:24.890 --> 18:25.969
offering backrubs.

18:25.970 --> 18:27.249
Not really.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.997
Circling for an orifice.

18:31.210 --> 18:32.689
Was he always that oily or...

18:32.690 --> 18:33.996
OK, look.

18:36.110 --> 18:37.369
What?

18:37.370 --> 18:38.679
It's nothing, but...

18:41.450 --> 18:45.449
You may have noticed a bit
of an atmosphere because...

18:47.161 --> 18:50.689
me and Jonas, years ago,
had a bit of a thing.

18:50.690 --> 18:52.849
You had a thing with oily dude man?

18:52.850 --> 18:53.929
It was just a little thing

18:53.930 --> 18:55.449
and I didn't even know
you back then, so...

18:55.450 --> 18:57.106
You slept with oily dude man?

18:57.977 --> 18:59.249
That's hilarious!

18:59.250 --> 19:01.929
We've all got our skeletons,
how about you and Gemma?

19:01.930 --> 19:03.529
What, I told you about Gemma.

19:03.530 --> 19:04.873
Gemma was a nutcase...

19:05.880 --> 19:07.911
But you never mentioned Jonas.

19:07.936 --> 19:10.805
I did, I told you I hooked up
with someone in Marrakech.

19:10.814 --> 19:12.002
Jonas is Mr Marrakesh?!

19:12.010 --> 19:13.249
It was a stupid thing...

19:13.258 --> 19:17.289
I thought Mr Marrakech was some
sort of super cool...

19:17.290 --> 19:18.329
Not him.

19:18.330 --> 19:20.489
It was years ago and...

19:20.490 --> 19:22.889
Are you embarrassed by that?

19:22.890 --> 19:24.866
Cos it's embarrassing.

19:25.515 --> 19:28.659
I'm sorry, but, Christ,
are you not embarrassed?

19:28.660 --> 19:30.139
It was years ago.

19:30.140 --> 19:31.899
But you dated him for a month?

19:31.900 --> 19:33.099
That's what I said.

19:33.100 --> 19:37.099
Cos when you told me about
Mr Marrakech, it was a week.

19:37.900 --> 19:38.957
No, I didn't.

19:40.020 --> 19:41.092
Pah!

19:42.940 --> 19:44.420
TAPE WINDING

19:44.731 --> 19:45.939
'What about you?'

19:45.940 --> 19:48.219
I don't want to see our
first time right now.

19:48.220 --> 19:49.299
Shh, you're about to talk.

19:49.300 --> 19:52.459
'I went away and had a little thing
that did my head in for a while

19:52.460 --> 19:55.579
'with this, sort of...

19:55.580 --> 19:59.139
'..this, sort of, headfuck
that I met in Marrakech.'

19:59.140 --> 20:00.459
'Mr Marrakech?'

20:00.460 --> 20:01.779
'(LAUGHS) Yeah.'

20:01.780 --> 20:05.179
'I'm imagining a chillum
and a big knob.'

20:05.180 --> 20:09.179
'(LAUGHS) No, it was like dormouse.'

20:09.260 --> 20:12.099
'Big deal, big heart-breaker?'

20:12.100 --> 20:14.539
'No, it was just a week.

20:14.540 --> 20:16.859
'It was a weird week.'

20:16.860 --> 20:18.179
So, a weird week or a month?

20:18.180 --> 20:20.019
The point is, it wasn't a big deal.

20:20.020 --> 20:21.779
Well, it was big enough
to do your head in.

20:22.618 --> 20:26.013
Jonas, King Dormouse-Dick
of Marrakech did your head in!

20:28.780 --> 20:31.259
That was a nice night, used to be.

20:31.260 --> 20:32.756
You're getting obsessed.

20:33.620 --> 20:34.699
I'm not.

20:34.700 --> 20:37.179
We had all this with Dan, I don't
want you going like that again.

20:37.180 --> 20:39.979
He had little creepy beady eyes
and he was always...

20:39.980 --> 20:41.979
What? Acting like
he was interested?

20:41.980 --> 20:44.139
And you know what, I think
he probably did fancy me

20:44.140 --> 20:46.219
and actually he wasn't
completely hideous,

20:46.220 --> 20:50.157
so in another life I don't know,
but nothing happened!

20:51.220 --> 20:53.859
And Jonas...

20:53.860 --> 20:57.859
he's an old fling.
So what? Don't go all fucked up!

20:58.220 --> 20:59.499
What, I'm fucked up, am I?

20:59.500 --> 21:00.739
No, I mean, just...

21:00.740 --> 21:04.739
No, no, no, that's brilliant,
sometimes you're a bitch.

21:08.109 --> 21:09.825
I didn't mean that.

21:11.300 --> 21:12.579
'You're a bitch!'

21:12.580 --> 21:14.739
I'd like you to erase that.

21:14.740 --> 21:15.819
'You're a bitch!'

21:15.820 --> 21:17.699
Also, "sometimes".

21:17.700 --> 21:20.874
You can't just edit off
the word, "sometimes"!

22:02.140 --> 22:06.483
I'm sorry, Fi, I know I go a bit
weird and wonky sometimes.

22:16.260 --> 22:18.299
- I love you, you know?
- I know.

Come here a second.
I just want your opinion.

It's just a silly game.

24:53.001 --> 24:55.102

There's no need to be nice,
the man's a prick.

25:00.240 --> 25:03.999
Is that funny, in your opinion?

Morning.

25:18.156 --> 25:19.443
What's this?

25:19.444 --> 25:21.849
I'm just getting Gina's
opinion on something.

25:21.874 --> 25:23.546
I'm a serial monogamist.

25:24.031 --> 25:26.639
I'm staying faithful
to my corn flakes right now.

25:26.640 --> 25:28.638
LAUGHTER

25:28.763 --> 25:31.638
I was just wondering because you
found it funny, but it isn't,

25:31.763 --> 25:33.080
and Gina agrees.

25:33.205 --> 25:34.660
I don't really want to get involved.

25:34.673 --> 25:36.799
Let me get you a cab.
My dad's on his way.

25:36.800 --> 25:38.279
Just one other thing.

25:39.464 --> 25:44.127
We both want him to come back,
but who wants him to come back more?

25:44.252 --> 25:47.397
Off the top of your head,
who wants him to come back more?

25:47.522 --> 25:49.078
OK, well, bye.

25:49.203 --> 25:50.249
Yeah, bye.

25:50.821 --> 25:53.606
Wow, it's early. It's early
to call it a night.

25:53.631 --> 25:55.686
Fancy a quick one down the pub?

25:55.811 --> 25:58.802
Got to get back, rescue Jodie
from the paedophile baby-sitter.

25:58.803 --> 25:59.999
That's just a...

26:00.000 --> 26:02.084
That's a joke.

26:02.433 --> 26:03.452
Sorry.

26:03.920 --> 26:07.393
Jonas, why don't you come back to
ours for a nightcap, if you want?

26:08.360 --> 26:09.646
Yeah.

26:09.659 --> 26:10.905
KNOCKING AT DOOR

26:11.030 --> 26:14.623
Now, ignore the joke. Who's
more keen for him to come back?

26:14.646 --> 26:16.076
I don't know.

26:16.078 --> 26:17.334
You do know, Gina.

26:17.562 --> 26:19.489
I'm so sorry, he's really hungover.

26:19.490 --> 26:20.883
That's OK.

26:34.483 --> 26:37.025
I'm staying faithful to
my corn flakes right now.

26:37.050 --> 26:38.479
LAUGHTER

26:39.123 --> 26:40.958
That is just objectively not funny.

26:40.982 --> 26:42.957
Anyone would say,
"That's not funny."

26:43.032 --> 26:44.709
That was fucking embarrassing.

26:47.880 --> 26:50.399
Whatever you're queuing up, stop it.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.908
Sit down, please.

27:01.563 --> 27:02.919
You see that?

27:03.563 --> 27:05.472
You know Geoff?

27:05.496 --> 27:08.439
Yeah, you remember me and Geoff,
because he would have shown you

27:08.816 --> 27:12.439
a re-do of the side of his fridge,
something like that.

27:13.097 --> 27:15.158
- Spot the difference.
- You're drunk.

27:15.283 --> 27:18.239
I'm the difference.
He's the greatest guy in the world

27:18.240 --> 27:20.599
and then I arrived and... you clam.

27:21.349 --> 27:22.655
For clarity.

27:24.853 --> 27:26.719
We're just talking!

27:27.278 --> 27:30.197
But moments later, you're so stiff.

27:30.322 --> 27:31.847
I don't know, a re-do...

27:31.862 --> 27:33.988
You don't know how
to stand around him.

27:34.001 --> 27:36.439
Your gauges are all over the place,
hot and cold.

27:36.440 --> 27:37.879
This is just stupid!

27:37.880 --> 27:39.964
You can't hide it.
Not completely.

27:40.989 --> 27:42.569
See how you look at him.

27:43.040 --> 27:46.839
The less the relationship means,
the more you spend on the wedding.

27:46.840 --> 27:50.119
Really, you start obsessing
about these tiny little details

27:50.120 --> 27:52.919
like the thickness
of the wedding invitation paper.

27:52.920 --> 27:55.639
Now, how you look at me.

27:55.640 --> 27:58.159
I think it's an interesting choice,
going grainless.

27:58.160 --> 27:59.519
It's a brave choice.

27:59.520 --> 28:03.039
I'm sorry, but...

28:03.040 --> 28:06.119
Tell me you look at me nice
like you look at him. You can't.

28:06.120 --> 28:08.719
And how am I looking
at you now, Liam?

28:08.720 --> 28:10.719
How long did you go out
with him for?

28:10.720 --> 28:12.736
Does it matter?

28:14.664 --> 28:17.559
FILM REWINDING

28:17.800 --> 28:21.359
You know, half the organic
memories you have are junk.

28:21.360 --> 28:24.151
Just not trustworthy.
When it comes to little things.

28:24.176 --> 28:25.519
And big ones.

28:26.280 --> 28:27.801
Is that Marrakesh?

28:29.523 --> 28:31.942
Does that look like Marrakesh?

28:35.280 --> 28:36.359
No.

28:36.360 --> 28:38.359
It's not Marrakesh.

28:38.360 --> 28:42.359
So, how long did you
go out with him for?

28:44.560 --> 28:47.157
All right, about six months.

28:50.671 --> 28:53.435
So not a week or a month.
Six months.

28:53.768 --> 28:55.931
The ever-inflating romance.

28:55.932 --> 28:57.879
You're probably still
going out with him.

28:57.880 --> 28:59.477
Why am I on trial here?

29:00.124 --> 29:01.559
What's been going on?

29:01.560 --> 29:03.639
Nothing has been going on.

29:03.640 --> 29:08.074
It was... Christ, you know how it
is when you first get with someone

29:08.075 --> 29:11.395
and then previous
boyfriends come up.

29:11.396 --> 29:13.688
He was never a boyfriend,
he was always a weird week.

29:13.702 --> 29:16.163
I downplayed it.
I fudged it, it was...

29:16.167 --> 29:17.038
You lied.

29:17.050 --> 29:19.997
Not everything that
isn't true is a lie, Liam.

29:22.040 --> 29:23.599
Hello?

29:23.600 --> 29:26.783
So he was a bigger thing than I made
out and, yeah, he's sort of a dick.

29:26.843 --> 29:28.225
Sort of? He's a massive...

29:28.238 --> 29:30.039
I liked him then.

29:30.040 --> 29:33.712
And I don't like him,
not like that, not now.

29:34.960 --> 29:37.257
So, just to get this clear.

29:37.382 --> 29:40.179
He fucks you, gets footage
for his redo wank file,

29:40.192 --> 29:41.135
but you're still pally.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.117
This is sad!

29:42.153 --> 29:44.135
- Cos if he was...
- This is just sad!

29:44.136 --> 29:45.977
He probably sits there
and tosses himself

29:45.978 --> 29:47.512
off all over his
cashmere blanket.

29:47.537 --> 29:48.781
It was years ago!

29:49.843 --> 29:51.156
Not for him.

29:52.363 --> 29:55.817
I'd find myself watching
redos of really hot times

29:55.830 --> 29:57.645
early in relationships.

29:57.770 --> 29:58.919
'Easy.'

29:59.794 --> 30:02.118
Sober up.
Make yourself puke.

30:02.243 --> 30:04.797
Whatever, I don't care.
Just sort this out.

30:05.787 --> 30:06.863
Fuck.

30:07.480 --> 30:11.972
I'd find myself watching
redos of really hot times

30:11.985 --> 30:14.136
early in relationships.

30:14.158 --> 30:15.464
Easy.

30:18.200 --> 30:21.799
And I'm downstairs watching
some redo of some night

30:21.800 --> 30:24.959
I've picked up somebody else and...

30:24.960 --> 30:28.439
Yeah, nice, Geoff. She's upstairs
waiting to have sex with me

30:28.440 --> 30:31.119
and I'm downstairs watching
some redo

30:31.120 --> 30:33.279
of some night I've picked
up somebody else.

30:33.280 --> 30:34.879
Easy.

30:34.880 --> 30:37.797
And I'm fucking pulling myself off.
I'm just saying.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.627
'Green warning.

30:42.643 --> 30:45.388

30:54.455 --> 30:55.785
Thank you.

31:07.102 --> 31:08.855
BUZZER

31:11.354 --> 31:13.194
- 'Who's that?'
- It's Liam.

31:15.110 --> 31:16.550
Liam from last night.

31:17.446 --> 31:20.357
'Liam. Is Fi with you?'

31:20.482 --> 31:22.078
She's not, no.

31:22.763 --> 31:25.610
'Sorry, Liam, mate,
is there something that you want?'

31:25.622 --> 31:28.034
Yeah, I just want to
come in and talk to you.

31:28.035 --> 31:29.240
Can you open the gate?

31:29.241 --> 31:32.734
(CLEARS THROAT) Yeah, sure.
I'll let you in.

31:32.859 --> 31:34.537
Nice one, nice one.

31:49.218 --> 31:51.456
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:51.480 --> 31:52.879
What do you want?

31:52.880 --> 31:55.213
I just want to come in
for a bit, dude.

31:56.840 --> 31:59.397
That looks expensive.
Is that expensive?

31:59.414 --> 32:01.279
Look, Liam, it's morning, mate.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.557
Fucking hell. Liam.

32:10.072 --> 32:13.666
Jonas, this is a nice place!

32:16.828 --> 32:21.342
Hey. Seriously, man, it's not cool
you just walking in like this.

32:21.357 --> 32:23.795
To be honest with you,
it's a little bit weird.

32:23.820 --> 32:25.616
Is that a Marrakeshian lamp?

32:31.480 --> 32:33.717
Liam, do I have to call Fi?

32:34.504 --> 32:36.842
Did you guys have a row
or something like that?

32:36.843 --> 32:38.744
- Sit down.
- No, I'm all right.

32:38.993 --> 32:42.079
Go on, sit down. It's not
a bear trap, it's a chair.

32:47.065 --> 32:49.957
Do you want me to bounce this
off your fucking head?

32:53.602 --> 32:54.734
(LAUGHS)

32:55.206 --> 32:57.245
I'm joking, Jonas.

32:57.370 --> 33:00.039
Bloody hell, I thought you were
supposed to be cool, man.

33:00.040 --> 33:02.798
I thought you were meant
to be fucking brilliant.

33:02.923 --> 33:04.633
What's going on?

33:08.626 --> 33:09.957
Yeah, figures.

33:10.470 --> 33:13.037
Get some good stuff
for the scrapbook?

33:14.508 --> 33:15.814
I think you should go.

33:16.162 --> 33:17.959
I don't blame you.
I would have.

33:18.795 --> 33:20.648
Tell you what, let's have a look.

33:20.983 --> 33:23.559
Go on, chuck it
on the screen, don't be shy!

33:23.855 --> 33:25.161
Come on!

33:25.723 --> 33:28.532
I'm fucking joking again, Jonas!

33:28.818 --> 33:32.313
For goodness' sake,
you need to grow a sense of humour.

33:32.550 --> 33:34.577
- He's uptight, isn't he?
- OK, Liam.

33:37.604 --> 33:39.681
- It's a lovely room, this.
- Thank you.

33:40.862 --> 33:43.710
Is this where you masturbate
to images of my wife?

33:44.803 --> 33:48.646
- Or do you do it in that room?
- OK, Liam, I want you to leave now.

33:48.771 --> 33:51.479
Do you sometimes start in here
and then finish in there?

33:51.480 --> 33:53.786
The world's pretty much your oyster,
isn't it?

33:53.798 --> 33:55.216
I want you to leave.

34:00.263 --> 34:02.099
Well, that's a pity.

34:02.163 --> 34:04.796
- Come on, mate.
- All right, now, what are you doing?

34:04.806 --> 34:07.115
Don't do that.
Come on now!

34:07.495 --> 34:09.612
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

34:09.616 --> 34:13.355
- Jesus! Get out!
- Stand up, Jonas, come on!

34:54.159 --> 34:55.167
Hey.

34:56.179 --> 34:57.332
What do you want?

34:59.020 --> 35:03.575
INDECIPHERABLE GIBBERISH

35:03.960 --> 35:05.415
Don't do that.

35:05.439 --> 35:06.874
Come on, Danny!

35:06.898 --> 35:08.664
- 'What are you doing?
- 'What are you doing?

35:08.676 --> 35:11.901
'Jesus! Get out, you fucking prick.

35:11.925 --> 35:13.293
'Tell you what... '

35:17.140 --> 35:18.685
Stop it!

35:21.122 --> 35:22.979
I tell you what you're going to do.

35:22.980 --> 35:25.659
You're going to get every bit
of Fion you've got in there

35:25.660 --> 35:28.699
and you're going to select it
all and you're going to wipe it!

35:28.700 --> 35:31.425
Hello, police, I'm witnessing
a serious assault at five...

35:32.258 --> 35:33.402
'Wipe it!

35:33.527 --> 35:34.615
'Fuck off.

35:34.616 --> 35:36.739
'I don't have a brain chip
to show you.'

35:36.740 --> 35:38.899
This is a bottle, right?

35:38.900 --> 35:42.121
Either you wipe it or
I will fucking gouge you myself.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.166
Jesus!

35:43.191 --> 35:44.223
OK.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.317
Just do what he says.

35:47.300 --> 35:49.675
Not on your eye, in there.

35:49.700 --> 35:51.219
On there!

35:51.220 --> 35:52.479
He's doing it!

35:55.477 --> 35:57.566
Now, delete it all.
The lot!

35:58.484 --> 36:02.625
Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.

36:02.750 --> 36:04.064
I'm doing it.

36:12.812 --> 36:14.901
Stay away from my house!

36:26.460 --> 36:28.859
'Now, delete it all.
The lot!

36:29.261 --> 36:33.613
'Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.

36:33.638 --> 36:35.018
'I'm doing it.'

37:21.754 --> 37:23.060
Liam?

37:24.415 --> 37:25.771
Where did you go?

37:30.793 --> 37:32.136
What happened?

37:33.380 --> 37:34.539
Liam, what happened?

37:34.540 --> 37:36.309
Did you use a condom or not?

37:40.060 --> 37:41.076
Just say.

37:43.500 --> 37:45.299
Liam, whatever you think...

37:45.300 --> 37:46.632
Am I Jodie's father?

37:47.780 --> 37:49.259
- Liam!
- Am I?

37:49.260 --> 37:50.339
Yes, of course.

37:50.766 --> 37:53.219
- You sure about that?
- Yes!

37:53.882 --> 37:55.287
That's nice.

37:59.780 --> 38:01.905
I always liked that picture,
didn't you?

38:02.589 --> 38:04.243
It's why I bought it for you.

38:05.101 --> 38:07.899
I never liked it.
Thought it was pretentious shit.

38:21.608 --> 38:23.200
'I'll tell you what you're
going to do.

38:23.225 --> 38:25.219
'You're going to get every
bit of Fion... '

38:25.220 --> 38:26.579
' Christ, what have you done?

38:26.580 --> 38:27.659
'Select it all... '

38:27.660 --> 38:29.139
We're getting to the good bit.

38:29.140 --> 38:32.202
'Hello, police, I'm witnessing
a serious assault at... '

38:38.660 --> 38:41.339
'Now, delete it all.
The lot!

38:41.340 --> 38:45.969
'Or I will crack your skull
and I will gouge your fucking neck.'

38:55.522 --> 38:57.238
18 months ago in this room.

39:08.561 --> 39:10.675
You know when you suspect something,

39:11.162 --> 39:13.877
it's always better
when it turns out to be true.

39:15.820 --> 39:19.339
It's like I've had a bad tooth
for years and I'm just finally

39:19.340 --> 39:22.957
getting my tongue in there and I'm
digging out all the rotten shit.

39:25.260 --> 39:26.739
That's not what it looks like.

39:26.740 --> 39:28.539
Oh, this did Jonas come round
to read you a story?

39:28.540 --> 39:29.579
No, it was...

39:29.580 --> 39:30.739
A story about fucking?

39:30.740 --> 39:32.339
It was...

39:32.340 --> 39:35.415
When all the Dan stuff was going on
and you'd walked out.

39:38.460 --> 39:39.619
For like ten minutes.

39:39.620 --> 39:41.455
For five days, Liam.

39:42.260 --> 39:43.992
No call, no nothing.

39:46.529 --> 39:48.939
So you fucked him after four days?

39:48.940 --> 39:50.419
That's heroic.

39:50.420 --> 39:54.259
I mean, three days,
that's admirable, but four days?

39:54.260 --> 39:56.059
I mean, you must have been gagging.

39:56.060 --> 39:57.581
I was so upset.

39:59.865 --> 40:02.527
We went for a drink, I got drunk.

40:02.974 --> 40:04.765
It shouldn't have happened.

40:05.972 --> 40:07.477
I'm sorry.

40:09.624 --> 40:12.939
I'm so sorry,
I can't say anything else.

40:12.940 --> 40:14.212
I love you.

40:17.820 --> 40:19.459
Did you use a condom?

40:19.460 --> 40:20.619
Yes.

40:20.620 --> 40:23.384
Cos we didn't have any here.
We were trying.

40:24.780 --> 40:26.019
He had some.

40:26.020 --> 40:27.779
In his pocket?

40:27.780 --> 40:29.162
In his car.

40:30.877 --> 40:33.397
Was it his decision,
or did you make him wear one?

40:33.522 --> 40:34.823
I made him.

40:35.690 --> 40:37.866
- And you saw him put it on?
- Yes.

40:38.314 --> 40:39.632
Show me, then.

40:41.323 --> 40:42.900
Show me on there.

40:48.940 --> 40:50.773
I need to see it, Fi.

40:52.899 --> 40:54.255
I deleted it.

40:54.900 --> 40:57.859
I wanted it to go away,
I wiped the whole thing.

40:57.984 --> 40:59.435
- Did you?
- Yeah.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.704
So there's just a blank
gap in your timeline?

41:01.829 --> 41:03.277
Yeah.

41:04.254 --> 41:05.658
Show me that, then.

41:09.660 --> 41:11.479
Yeah, OK.

41:12.337 --> 41:13.841
I have to find it.

41:20.325 --> 41:22.315
No! No deleting it, not now.

41:22.440 --> 41:24.379
No, no.

41:27.464 --> 41:28.857
It's still on there, is it?

41:31.700 --> 41:33.037
I'm sorry.

41:35.316 --> 41:37.059
You have to show it to me, Fi.

41:37.060 --> 41:38.259
Why?

41:38.260 --> 41:39.655
Cos I want to see it.

41:42.174 --> 41:43.890
I love you.

41:44.580 --> 41:45.987
Show it to me.

41:46.857 --> 41:48.499
No.

41:48.500 --> 41:49.739
- Show it to me.
- No.

41:49.740 --> 41:50.979
- Show it to me!
- No!

41:50.980 --> 41:54.544
Show it to me! I want to see!
I want to see what he looks like!

41:56.660 --> 41:59.395
This isn't me!
Look what you're doing to me!

42:00.180 --> 42:02.085
Fi, I need to see it!

42:03.055 --> 42:04.398
Please.

42:13.620 --> 42:17.619
I need to see it, Fi.

42:50.244 --> 42:52.109
