00:07.520 --> 00:11.600
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:12.560 --> 00:15.640
How far would you go to be popular?

00:16.440 --> 00:17.480
<i>This is</i> The Circle.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.760
<i>A game where you can be</i>
<i>whoever you want to be</i>

00:19.840 --> 00:22.520
<i>to get a 67,000 dollar prize.</i>

00:24.120 --> 00:28.120
<i>Nine players will start the competition</i>
<i>by moving into the same building.</i>

00:29.320 --> 00:32.400
<i>They will live a few meters away</i>
<i>from each other</i>

00:32.480 --> 00:35.120
<i>without seeing or hearing one another.</i>

00:39.240 --> 00:42.800
<i>They have no idea who's on the other side.</i>

00:42.880 --> 00:44.000
<i>But who does?</i>

00:48.040 --> 00:49.720
Because they can only communicate

00:49.800 --> 00:53.640
through a smart, voice-activated platform:

00:53.720 --> 00:54.880
The Circle.

00:58.520 --> 01:02.640
<i>The key is to draw attention</i>
<i>through a social media profile.</i>

01:03.200 --> 01:06.680
<i>Imagine having to impress someone</i>
<i>using only photo and text.</i>

01:08.680 --> 01:11.400
Which means, everything is allowed.

01:14.600 --> 01:17.160
Even a fake profile.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.160
#ImScared.

01:21.280 --> 01:24.640
<i>If a player isn't interesting enough,</i>
<i>they will be blocked</i>

01:24.840 --> 01:26.920
<i>and replaced by a new one.</i>

01:28.400 --> 01:30.640
At the end, the remaining contestant,

01:30.720 --> 01:33.720
after being selected as most popular
by the other players,

01:33.800 --> 01:35.160
will take the grand prize.

01:35.240 --> 01:37.960
Welcome to <i>The Circle Brazil.</i>

01:57.120 --> 01:58.760
<i>With the rules laid out,</i>

01:58.840 --> 02:02.920
<i>who will be the first player to arrive</i>
<i>at The Circle apartment?</i>

02:06.280 --> 02:08.600
Holy mother of God.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.640
No way! I love it already!

02:11.920 --> 02:13.560
It looks so hip.

02:16.160 --> 02:17.040
My goodness.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.880
It's my home.

02:19.960 --> 02:22.520
Plants, vegetation... Wow.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.520
I feel relaxed. Everything's fine.
I was feeling tense.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.520
My name is João Akel.
I'm 20, from Araxá, Minas Gerais.

02:35.600 --> 02:37.560
People have a hard time talking to me.

02:37.640 --> 02:40.520
I speak and think too fast,
nobody understands what I say.

02:40.600 --> 02:42.960
So they only nod and smile.

02:45.560 --> 02:46.640
I love to party.

02:46.720 --> 02:49.600
I tried to settle down,
but it's not for me.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.200
Where I'm from, people like to gossip.

02:53.280 --> 02:55.920
Even I gossip, whether I like it or not.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.080
It's an exchange.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.720
You offer information to people,
and vice versa.

02:59.800 --> 03:01.600
You always win in the end.

03:03.280 --> 03:06.120
I'm a 20-year-old business student,

03:06.200 --> 03:09.600
but in the game, I will be
a 30-year-old dietician.

03:11.720 --> 03:15.400
My character, the doctor,
has already been tested in real life.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.040
I dated a girl for five months
pretending to be a doctor.

03:18.120 --> 03:19.800
She has yet to find out.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.840
One day, she wasn't feeling that well.

03:23.920 --> 03:27.360
Everybody looked at me.
She said I was a doctor.

03:28.480 --> 03:32.720
If I pretend to be a doctor and older,
I can show some credibility.

03:32.800 --> 03:35.840
There's a huge difference
between a 20-year-old and a 30-year-old.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.920
I went way back to the 90s,

03:38.000 --> 03:40.400
watched the movies
they watched back then, <i>Titanic...</i>

03:40.480 --> 03:41.480
I love that movie.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.320
So my character is a pro in this already.

03:45.120 --> 03:46.920
It'll be a big hit in Brazil.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.640
Let me take a look in here.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.320
Very homey. Wine glasses.

03:54.400 --> 03:56.520
I will sip some delicious wine.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.600
I broke it already.

04:01.400 --> 04:03.120
<i>One player breaks wine glasses.</i>

04:03.200 --> 04:05.400
Will the next one break the Internet?

04:08.200 --> 04:11.560
Oh, my God!

04:12.120 --> 04:15.200
This is fabulous!

04:18.520 --> 04:21.000
<i>The Circle Brazil!</i>

04:21.800 --> 04:26.000
This is my chance to shine, honey.

04:26.560 --> 04:29.640
My name is Dumaresq,
I'm 24 years old and I'm an artist.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.280
I'm from Natal, Rio Grande do Norte.
I'm not discreet at all.

04:34.800 --> 04:35.960
Look at this face,

04:36.040 --> 04:38.160
at these eyes, at this outfit.

04:38.240 --> 04:40.280
I'm honest. That's the way I am.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.760
Do you want to talk to me? Do it.
Otherwise, scram.

04:42.840 --> 04:45.520
If I'm a bother,
if I make people talk, wonderful.

04:48.840 --> 04:51.760
I love to expose myself on social media.

04:51.840 --> 04:54.800
You'll see me eating, pooping,
showering, kissing.

04:54.880 --> 04:57.360
I have a lot of nudes out there.

04:57.440 --> 05:00.080
Men ask me for nudes,
I go, "Here, take all of them."

05:01.560 --> 05:04.320
We get to know people through intimacy.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.480
I love to talk about poop and B.O.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.920
I will be myself in The Circle,

05:11.000 --> 05:12.680
but a bit more dramatic.

05:13.680 --> 05:17.800
I'll get into a lot of fights
because I'm nosy and love to argue.

05:19.040 --> 05:21.720
I'll definitely be the spice in this game.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.360
When I notice people chatting,
I will throw in some spice.

05:26.520 --> 05:29.560
Fame, money, and social media.
I'm in my habitat.

05:32.440 --> 05:35.240
Look at this. My God.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.760
I'm in my element.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.160
<i>Totally!</i>

05:42.240 --> 05:45.880
<i>Your outfit even matches the sofa</i>
<i>because, here in </i>The Circle,

05:45.960 --> 05:48.960
<i>all players deserve a spot</i>
<i>that suits them.</i>

05:49.920 --> 05:51.720
Girl!

05:55.840 --> 05:56.840
This is gorgeous!

05:59.000 --> 06:01.920
I am my butt, my butt is me.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.280
My name is Marina.
I'm 25, from Rio de Janeiro.

06:07.360 --> 06:09.480
I live in Méier. It can't get any better.

06:09.560 --> 06:13.200
I just got certified.
I'm a flight attendant now.

06:13.280 --> 06:15.240
Because I love to fly, that's it.

06:16.680 --> 06:19.600
I'll be an alter ego,
but I'll use my personality.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.000
I love to sing in the shower
since I was little,

06:22.080 --> 06:24.000
so I'll be an amateur singer.

06:24.080 --> 06:28.120
I had this idea because I believe
music brings people together.

06:28.200 --> 06:30.480
What's the catch? The catch is...

06:30.560 --> 06:33.000
I don't know how to sing, but I sing.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.400
Wanna hear me sing? No can do.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.440
It'll work out in the end.

06:42.360 --> 06:45.320
I'll flirt with anyone if necessary.

06:45.400 --> 06:46.440
Men, women.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.080
An uncle. A grandpa. A granny.

06:50.840 --> 06:51.680
Anyway...

06:52.760 --> 06:55.040
There's money on the line, let's do this.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.480
Do you want me to feed your ego?
Leave it to me.

06:58.520 --> 06:59.880
But bring some milk.

07:02.200 --> 07:04.840
I rarely apologize, like...

07:05.320 --> 07:08.480
"I've already...
I've already apologized for that."

07:08.560 --> 07:10.960
Get it? Like,
"It was the first thing I did."

07:12.160 --> 07:14.000
The more you envy me,

07:14.560 --> 07:15.960
the bigger my butt gets.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.640
<i>Marina, hold your horses.</i>

07:28.720 --> 07:30.320
<i>People are still arriving.</i>

07:32.800 --> 07:34.360
<i>Hey there! What's up?</i>

07:34.440 --> 07:35.760
<i>I'm Julia.</i>

07:36.240 --> 07:39.040
<i>Sometimes people judge me</i>
<i>because my style is different.</i>

07:39.120 --> 07:41.520
<i>But I am joining </i>The Circle

07:41.600 --> 07:44.080
<i>to prove that looks can be deceiving.</i>

07:44.160 --> 07:45.440
<i>Because...</i>

07:46.560 --> 07:47.400
Julia is...

07:48.800 --> 07:50.120
this beast right here.

07:52.920 --> 07:54.880
My name is Rob. I'm 34 years old.

07:54.960 --> 07:57.280
I'm a cutler from Sorocaba, São Paulo.

07:58.360 --> 08:02.640
People perceive me
as this savage guy, kind of a brute.

08:02.720 --> 08:05.400
They see a wild bear from the outside,

08:05.480 --> 08:08.280
then they realize
I'm a Care Bear on the inside.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.640
I know the real Julia.

08:12.720 --> 08:14.080
She's a cutler too.

08:14.160 --> 08:18.360
In terms of personality,
Julia will be like me.

08:19.480 --> 08:24.400
But I want her to be bisexual and single,
while I'm straight and married.

08:25.080 --> 08:29.040
I can hardly see a disadvantage
in being a woman in the show.

08:29.120 --> 08:32.680
I was raised by women.
My mom is my biggest idol.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.360
To me, women are badass.

08:36.520 --> 08:40.200
I like when people think I'm impolite,
kind of aggressive.

08:40.280 --> 08:43.360
I can show that you can't judge a book
by its cover.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.560
If you're competing against me,
be careful.

08:47.640 --> 08:51.400
I'm compelling, charismatic,
and I'll win you over.

08:55.800 --> 08:57.440
Wow. Incredible, man.

08:57.520 --> 08:59.080
I even want to sleep now.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.360
Shit! Son of a bitch!

09:05.440 --> 09:06.480
I screwed up.

09:08.600 --> 09:10.280
I hope I didn't break the bed.

09:10.920 --> 09:12.840
<i>Yeah, that was heavy.</i>

09:12.920 --> 09:15.360
<i>Let's hope the next player takes it easy.</i>

09:15.440 --> 09:18.440
How beautiful! Wow.

09:19.160 --> 09:21.840
My God, this place is awesome.

09:22.800 --> 09:25.360
Do I wait for an "Action"
or may I start already?

09:27.240 --> 09:29.720
My name is Lorayne. I'm 22 years old.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.880
I'm from Realeza, Paraná,

09:31.960 --> 09:34.640
a very small town.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.720
I like to move, I'm hyperactive.

09:37.800 --> 09:40.640
It's sheer torture
not to spin on this stool.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.640
I'll miss my cellphone.

09:45.240 --> 09:46.880
In social media stories, we see,

09:46.960 --> 09:49.920
"My breakfast was perfect today.

09:50.000 --> 09:53.320
My maid cooked omelet and cranberry."

09:53.400 --> 09:54.760
F... you!

09:55.880 --> 09:57.960
I don't wanna be that kind of girl.

09:58.640 --> 10:01.080
Lo is going single to <i>The Circle.</i>

10:01.160 --> 10:02.640
No...

10:02.720 --> 10:04.720
If it's a pretty girl, I go...

10:05.640 --> 10:08.560
But women are not my only option.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.040
I'm into men too.

10:11.120 --> 10:12.840
#StayWild.

10:12.920 --> 10:17.000
I'm not going to make a sign
because only old people do this.

10:18.440 --> 10:22.000
I know I'm beautiful.
I'm not doing this for you, but for me.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.160
So yeah, I'm hot.

10:24.240 --> 10:27.280
I don't wanna lie about anything.

10:27.360 --> 10:30.480
I wanna be exactly who I am out there.

10:31.400 --> 10:34.120
This way, I have a better chance
of winning.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.040
Circle? Are you there?

10:41.640 --> 10:42.920
Can you hear me?

10:45.160 --> 10:46.600
I don't know how to interact.

10:46.680 --> 10:48.720
-Is there a button?
-Circle.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.520
Activate.

10:51.320 --> 10:54.480
-Circle?
-What's up, Circle? Where are you at?

10:54.560 --> 10:55.960
Can it see me?

10:56.040 --> 10:59.520
Is there a remote control for it
in this box? Can I open it?

11:00.480 --> 11:01.480
There isn't one.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.920
"Welcome to <i>The Circle."</i>

11:07.000 --> 11:10.520
Hey, girl, thanks!
I have to start getting into...

11:11.080 --> 11:12.160
character.

11:13.360 --> 11:15.960
-"This is a voice-activated..."
-"...system."

11:17.320 --> 11:18.920
"Set up your profile."

11:19.000 --> 11:22.440
Wow, this is a very stressful moment.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.520
Time for a <i>brigadeiro.</i>

11:25.480 --> 11:29.160
"Select an image from your gallery
to become your first profile picture."

11:30.240 --> 11:31.720
How do I open my gallery?

11:31.800 --> 11:33.480
Open my gallery, Circle.

11:35.760 --> 11:36.720
It worked.

11:38.720 --> 11:40.880
<i>Each player has a photo gallery.</i>

11:40.960 --> 11:45.600
<i>The hardest part is selecting one</i>
<i>to make a good first impression.</i>

11:46.360 --> 11:50.040
<i>After all, this is the only photo</i>
<i>the other players will see.</i>

11:54.040 --> 11:56.160
That photo is so me!

11:56.240 --> 11:58.480
The one with the cats is great, too.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.840
Circle, open the "Health" album.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.040
Whoa, what a handsome doctor.

12:04.120 --> 12:06.640
But I'm not starting with these.

12:06.720 --> 12:09.240
People might get suspicious.

12:09.320 --> 12:11.960
Circle, honey, go to the second photo.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.720
The orange one.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.720
Very esoteric, very hippie.

12:16.800 --> 12:18.040
Where are the photos?

12:19.960 --> 12:21.000
All lies.

12:22.080 --> 12:26.040
Circle, go to my photo in the pool.
The shirtless one.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.400
That one turned out great.

12:29.480 --> 12:31.600
That one represents me a lot.

12:31.680 --> 12:33.280
So Circle,

12:33.680 --> 12:36.080
add this profile picture.

12:36.160 --> 12:40.040
People are going to like me
because of this photo. I hope so.

12:43.680 --> 12:46.040
Girl, it's perfect.

12:47.080 --> 12:48.480
That photo...

12:48.560 --> 12:50.600
with the pool table.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.040
Awesome. I like it.

12:53.120 --> 12:57.520
It's simple, it shows her delicate side,
she shows some tattoos...

12:57.600 --> 12:59.760
Circle, add to my profile.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.320
Add to my profile, Circle.

13:04.480 --> 13:07.400
I love it.

13:07.480 --> 13:09.920
Name, photo: check. Now, my age.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.400
Thirty years old.

13:11.520 --> 13:14.360
A 20-year-old doesn't show credibility.

13:14.440 --> 13:17.480
I'm 25 years old, but how about 22?

13:18.040 --> 13:20.280
They'll want to talk to me, I know it.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.720
"Relationship status."

13:22.800 --> 13:24.360
Single, of course.

13:24.440 --> 13:26.080
Ready to party.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.120
Circle, put down single.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.000
I'm starting out smoothly.

13:30.080 --> 13:33.080
I'm here, but not really.

13:33.160 --> 13:34.520
Looking for love.

13:34.600 --> 13:36.040
No, single.

13:36.560 --> 13:39.040
In an open relationship.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.720
It's a conversation starter.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.560
Julia will draw more attention
if she's single, right?

13:44.600 --> 13:46.720
Circle, add "about me."

13:46.800 --> 13:49.120
The hardest part. Damn.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.800
I can't mess this up.
It's gotta be something cool.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.120
Circle, put down the following...

13:54.200 --> 13:55.480
Artist,

13:56.120 --> 13:58.040
Northeasterner,

13:58.440 --> 14:02.360
fem gay, and full of life.

14:02.440 --> 14:04.960
It's a general view of who I am.

14:05.040 --> 14:08.920
I love Japanese food... and astrology.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.160
I study signs.

14:10.240 --> 14:12.000
Virgo countryside girl,

14:12.080 --> 14:13.320
wannabe model,

14:13.400 --> 14:16.480
small-town, chatty princess.

14:16.560 --> 14:21.680
I am a doctor specialized in nutrition.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.240
It gives a lot of oomph.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.080
I'm a singer.

14:25.640 --> 14:29.800
One day, you will hear about me.

14:29.880 --> 14:34.600
Fire turns scrap metal into art.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.120
#StayWild.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.920
I think it looks good.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.920
-Circle, post my profile.
-Post my profile.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.160
It turned out really great.

14:45.160 --> 14:47.720
<i>Five profiles created: check!</i>

14:48.240 --> 14:50.800
<i>Whoa. Here comes more people.</i>

14:51.480 --> 14:53.760
Wow, there's a pleasant little garden.

14:54.400 --> 14:57.000
I love it. The sofa is amazing.

14:59.320 --> 15:01.800
Ouch, I bumped my head.

15:03.080 --> 15:06.440
My name is Gabriel. I'm 26 years old.
I'm also known as Gaybol.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.960
I'm a video game content creator.

15:10.040 --> 15:12.160
In other words, I'm a professional gamer.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.040
Video games aren't only
for children anymore.

15:18.120 --> 15:21.280
There are millions of people
in this industry, serious people.

15:21.360 --> 15:22.640
It's what I do for a living.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.520
I'll say I have a girlfriend.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.480
I'm only here to win the game.

15:28.840 --> 15:32.840
I'm more into slaying dragons
than French kissing, dude.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.240
Such a nerd.

15:38.440 --> 15:41.800
I'm hyperactive.
I can't stop moving, I can't shut up.

15:44.680 --> 15:46.880
I'm going to be myself.

15:46.960 --> 15:49.520
I'm really great with strategies.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.000
I'll be that guy
who waits for the right moment

15:55.080 --> 15:57.320
to stab in the back.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.040
Watch out, dude.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.840
I'm going to beat <i>The Circle.</i>

16:05.840 --> 16:07.760
Circle, good morning.
Circle, good afternoon.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.040
Circle, hello.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.440
Circle, what's up, bro?

16:12.520 --> 16:14.400
<i>Circle, what's good?</i>

16:15.320 --> 16:19.280
<i>While Gaybol tries to figure things out,</i>
<i>shall we peek into another apartment?</i>

16:23.160 --> 16:25.160
I'm in<i> The Circle!</i>

16:31.000 --> 16:34.920
Have you heard stories about
the fearless girls from the Northeast?

16:36.080 --> 16:39.280
So yeah, I am brave,
and I'm very proud of that.

16:40.280 --> 16:42.920
I'm bullied because of my accent,

16:43.000 --> 16:47.360
and, due to my stereotype,
people don't believe I'm a northeasterner.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.280
You don't want to hear my accent?

16:52.920 --> 16:54.200
No? <i>Non?</i>

16:54.280 --> 16:55.600
Too bad.

16:57.560 --> 17:00.280
I'm here to break all the stereotypes

17:00.360 --> 17:02.160
you can possibly imagine.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.040
I'm a DJ. Yes, women can be DJs too.

17:06.920 --> 17:08.800
I was Miss Paraíba 2018.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.560
It was an honor to represent my state.

17:11.640 --> 17:14.480
It'll be a good opportunity for me to show

17:14.560 --> 17:16.320
I'm more than just a pretty face.

17:16.960 --> 17:19.280
Because I competed
in the Miss Brazil Pageant,

17:19.360 --> 17:21.040
I have an advantage.

17:21.120 --> 17:24.200
I have experience in competitions,

17:24.280 --> 17:26.680
especially when it comes down
to popularity.

17:26.760 --> 17:30.040
So I'll be myself.
I can't pretend to be somebody else.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.040
With my originality,

17:34.120 --> 17:37.720
the winner of <i>The Circle</i>
will be from Paraíba.

17:37.800 --> 17:39.080
You will see.

17:41.920 --> 17:45.880
I feel crazy talking to myself,
but it's okay. It is what it is.

17:45.960 --> 17:47.680
There's a box here for me.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.080
I hope it's alcohol.

17:50.640 --> 17:54.880
Wow, there's so much food.
I thought I wouldn't mess up my diet.

17:55.600 --> 17:59.760
<i>Some people can't control their hunger,</i>
<i>some can't control their excitement.</i>

18:01.920 --> 18:04.200
Oh, my God! I have a bathtub!

18:04.560 --> 18:06.240
<i>I have a bathtub</i>

18:08.120 --> 18:10.440
Dad, do you see this?

18:10.520 --> 18:13.280
<i>I have an apartment, all to myself</i>

18:15.520 --> 18:17.480
I'm Paloma. You can call me Loma.

18:17.560 --> 18:18.800
I'm 26 years old.

18:18.880 --> 18:21.360
I'm the meme queen.
I joke about everything.

18:22.160 --> 18:24.240
This princess deserves a thousand likes.

18:24.320 --> 18:26.360
My smile is beautiful, after all.

18:26.640 --> 18:28.320
I like to define myself....

18:29.480 --> 18:31.240
as a trucker gay.

18:32.440 --> 18:34.360
I'm very persuasive.

18:34.440 --> 18:37.120
I've had several flings.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.360
I had two relationships at the same time.

18:40.440 --> 18:41.440
They didn't know.

18:42.040 --> 18:42.920
My bad.

18:43.360 --> 18:46.840
I'm single now, thanks to a divine energy.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.800
I've figured out the ideal profile.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.680
In <i>The Circle,</i> I will be Lucas.

18:53.040 --> 18:56.040
A 25-year-old straight man,
with a man bun.

18:56.120 --> 18:58.840
I only wear a bun if my hair is dirty.

18:59.920 --> 19:01.720
I borrowed my friend Lucas's photos.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.960
We tell the same silly jokes,

19:04.040 --> 19:05.920
we have the same outrageous laughter.

19:06.000 --> 19:07.320
He's persuasive too.

19:08.360 --> 19:11.200
A heterosexual, white male,
with straight hair,

19:11.280 --> 19:14.080
is automatically the most popular.

19:14.360 --> 19:17.080
I might be the best catfish of all time.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.400
Yes!

19:19.520 --> 19:24.000
To enter the game,
I did some research into male behavior.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.640
I'm prepared. I have a few pick-up lines.

19:26.720 --> 19:28.320
I believe I'm irresistible.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.000
I almost feel like a TV actress.

19:32.520 --> 19:34.000
Mom, I'm on TV!

19:37.880 --> 19:39.160
What's this?

19:39.240 --> 19:40.200
Is it edible?

19:41.160 --> 19:42.200
I hope so.

19:44.120 --> 19:45.440
Oh, it's <i>paçoca!</i>

19:46.560 --> 19:48.840
Oh, my God! It's so delicious!

19:48.920 --> 19:50.440
Paçoca<i> changes lives.</i>

19:50.520 --> 19:53.000
<i>And our last player saves lives.</i>

19:53.280 --> 19:54.240
<i>What an awful joke.</i>

19:54.840 --> 19:56.280
Let me kneel here.

19:57.080 --> 20:00.120
Hello, smart Brazilian people!

20:00.200 --> 20:02.520
Smart people from the whole world!

20:02.600 --> 20:04.880
I have arrived in <i>The Circle!</i>

20:07.200 --> 20:08.840
My name is João Paulo Gadelha.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.880
You can call me JP or Gadelha.

20:11.760 --> 20:12.920
I'm a true northeasterner.

20:14.400 --> 20:15.560
#Northeasterner.

20:16.760 --> 20:18.000
I'm a military firefighter.

20:18.080 --> 20:22.160
I like saving lives,
rescuing people, animals.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.080
This is what I'll show to people.

20:26.160 --> 20:28.800
I'm not just a shallow, good-looking guy.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.680
I have much more to offer than a body.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.920
I get hit on all the time,
I get harassed all the time.

20:38.840 --> 20:41.120
I receive a lot of nudes.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.320
Some of them make you wonder

20:43.400 --> 20:45.880
how they managed
to get a certain angle in a photo.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.000
I lose my temper easily.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.640
Joe Balloon is my nickname.

20:53.720 --> 20:55.680
Because I burst easily.

20:57.360 --> 20:59.760
You don't want to mess with me.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.840
My military experience
will help me in <i>The Circle,</i> for sure.

21:04.920 --> 21:08.160
I'm very picky and meticulous.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.760
Willpower, bravery.

21:10.840 --> 21:12.440
These are my strategies.

21:12.520 --> 21:16.440
So in <i>The Circle,</i> I want to fight
until the very end and win.

21:20.440 --> 21:22.120
Exfoliating scrub.

21:22.200 --> 21:25.800
This one is a facial cleanser.

21:25.880 --> 21:27.640
I have to take care of my skin,

21:27.720 --> 21:30.200
so I don't end up with a wrinkled face.

21:30.760 --> 21:33.120
<i>Don't worry. Nobody will see you.</i>

21:33.200 --> 21:34.720
<i>Enough chit-chat.</i>

21:34.800 --> 21:37.640
<i>Shall we put together a profile</i>
<i>so we can get some compliments?</i>

21:38.640 --> 21:40.160
WELCOME TO THE CIRCLE

21:42.200 --> 21:43.480
It's time, my dude!

21:43.560 --> 21:46.600
<i>To the left, to the right</i>
<i>Now do a circle</i>

21:48.360 --> 21:50.960
Circle, open my photo album.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.160
I like it. Hold on, let me see.

21:55.240 --> 21:56.640
Circle, open "Hobbies."

21:59.640 --> 22:01.480
There are some nice photos in there.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.600
My eyes are really intense there,
they draw attention.

22:04.680 --> 22:06.680
And I'm not wearing a lot of makeup.

22:06.760 --> 22:09.200
Circle, I want to add this photo
to my profile.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.440
It's bad. Terrible first impression.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.280
Circle, add this photo to my profile.

22:17.240 --> 22:18.280
Very nice.

22:18.360 --> 22:20.840
Circle, add this photo to my profile.

22:20.920 --> 22:24.040
I would kiss this dude on the lips.
Too bad we're just friends.

22:24.120 --> 22:25.920
And I'm not into men.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.000
I'm going to say I'm 28 years old.

22:28.560 --> 22:30.400
I'm actually 31, but...

22:30.480 --> 22:31.960
I think it's a good age.

22:32.480 --> 22:34.840
It's not quite 30, it's close to 30.

22:35.160 --> 22:36.440
He's an experienced man.

22:36.520 --> 22:38.080
"Relationship status."

22:38.160 --> 22:41.480
Single, since I'm actually single.

22:41.560 --> 22:43.360
Circle, put down "in a relationship."

22:44.160 --> 22:45.720
Lucas is single.

22:45.800 --> 22:48.000
I'm single too because...

22:48.080 --> 22:51.280
Well, there's plenty of fish in the sea.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.600
We can't stop.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.560
Sassy northeasterner.

22:56.640 --> 22:58.800
Wait, not sassy.

22:58.880 --> 23:01.760
People will keep saying, "Oh, he's sassy."

23:01.840 --> 23:04.760
I started modeling
when I was 15 years old.

23:04.840 --> 23:07.360
I also work as a DJ.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.880
I like to spend time with my family.

23:10.440 --> 23:15.320
Family shows this cool homebody vibe.

23:15.400 --> 23:18.960
I like anything that allows me
to stay at home.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.880
Physical effort is also not my thing.

23:21.960 --> 23:23.880
#Nerd.

23:23.960 --> 23:25.280
And a heart emoji.

23:26.160 --> 23:27.000
Done.

23:27.080 --> 23:28.800
It's great, I love it.

23:28.880 --> 23:31.160
Circle, post my profile.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.320
Dude, we're perfect.

23:33.720 --> 23:34.680
No flaws at all.

23:34.760 --> 23:37.080
If you see a fire, just hit me up.

23:37.160 --> 23:39.400
Circle, you may post my profile.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.920
Man, I can't wait to meet
my fellow players.

23:49.320 --> 23:53.520
<i>Nine players perfectly settled</i>
<i>into </i>The Circle<i> apartments.</i>

23:56.520 --> 23:58.360
ALERT!

23:58.440 --> 23:59.720
<i>The time has come.</i>

23:59.800 --> 24:00.720
"Alert."

24:00.800 --> 24:02.400
Shit. What happened?

24:03.280 --> 24:04.480
Jesus.

24:04.560 --> 24:06.360
Holy shit!

24:06.440 --> 24:07.520
What's this?

24:07.600 --> 24:09.320
Earthquake? Tsunami?

24:09.400 --> 24:12.520
Oh, my God!

24:14.760 --> 24:17.720
"All players must rate one another

24:17.800 --> 24:20.320
based on first impressions."

24:21.680 --> 24:23.160
Before I talk to any of them?

24:23.240 --> 24:25.400
Lord have mercy.

24:26.480 --> 24:31.280
"Open the profiles and rate the players

24:31.360 --> 24:33.240
from first to eighth place."

24:33.840 --> 24:36.520
This is so messed up, Mouse.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.520
Hold on. Are they going to rate me too?

24:39.600 --> 24:42.480
I'm ready, Circle. I'm ready.

24:43.600 --> 24:46.760
"First place is your favorite player,

24:46.840 --> 24:49.040
and eighth place is your least favorite."

24:49.120 --> 24:52.880
It's a lot of pressure to rate everybody
just like that, out of nowhere.

24:52.960 --> 24:54.280
Oh, no.

24:55.440 --> 24:57.440
Time to judge a book by its cover.

24:58.640 --> 25:03.200
"The top two players
will become influencers...

25:05.600 --> 25:07.200
and will hold great power."

25:08.280 --> 25:10.160
My goodness.

25:10.240 --> 25:12.160
Who wouldn't want it from the start?

25:12.240 --> 25:14.720
With great power
comes great responsibility.

25:14.800 --> 25:17.880
This will literally start a... bang, bang!

25:18.760 --> 25:20.680
"All other players

25:20.760 --> 25:23.240
-will be at risk of being blocked."
-Blocked?

25:23.320 --> 25:25.240
Oh, my God! No!

25:25.320 --> 25:27.320
Blocked right off the bat?

25:28.240 --> 25:29.520
Brace yourselves.

25:32.800 --> 25:33.880
I'm shocked.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.800
Open the profiles, Circle.

25:35.880 --> 25:38.760
It's time to meet this crazy bunch.

25:44.600 --> 25:47.800
I'm already regretting my photo. Crap.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.600
They'll think I'm a catfish.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.720
Hot, hot,

25:51.800 --> 25:53.720
I'd date him, hot...

25:54.360 --> 25:56.160
Hot. Oh, my God.

25:56.240 --> 25:58.320
Circle, open Ana Carla's profile.

25:59.720 --> 26:02.400
"Ana Carla. Age: 22.

26:02.480 --> 26:04.320
Relationship status: single."

26:04.400 --> 26:07.320
I don't know, that photo looks kinda fake.

26:07.880 --> 26:09.200
She's so beautiful.

26:09.760 --> 26:11.040
My competition.

26:11.120 --> 26:14.200
"I'm from Campina Grande, Paraíba."
Another northeasterner?

26:14.280 --> 26:16.400
The bit about being Miss Paraíba is...

26:17.600 --> 26:18.800
unnecessary.

26:18.880 --> 26:21.000
Circle, open Dumaresq's profile.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.640
It's a peculiar name.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.480
His mom shuffled letters at random
to give him his name.

26:26.560 --> 26:29.640
But that is a fierce queen!

26:29.720 --> 26:32.280
"In an open relationship." Naughty.

26:32.360 --> 26:34.680
"Artist, northeasterner...

26:35.440 --> 26:37.360
Fem gay."

26:37.920 --> 26:40.440
"Media student. In my free time,

26:40.520 --> 26:42.720
I go out and slay."

26:42.800 --> 26:44.640
I like it. I slay too.

26:44.720 --> 26:48.120
We have to see who is better at this.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.360
I'm so mad I didn't think about that!

26:50.440 --> 26:51.720
Circle...

26:52.360 --> 26:53.960
open Lorayne's profile.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.560
Lorayne, girl!

26:57.640 --> 27:00.400
She's wearing a coconut ring. Is she...

27:00.720 --> 27:02.160
a lesbian?

27:02.240 --> 27:03.920
We have something in common.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.080
I said I love astrology.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.800
and like to party.

27:08.080 --> 27:11.880
I love it. "Party."
Just the word I was looking for.

27:11.960 --> 27:13.000
We're gonna get along.

27:17.120 --> 27:18.520
My English is bad.

27:18.600 --> 27:21.040
Circle, open JP's profile.

27:27.000 --> 27:29.120
He's so hot.

27:29.200 --> 27:30.160
Firefighter.

27:30.240 --> 27:35.320
One could say he's a porn star
dressed as a firefighter.

27:35.400 --> 27:38.040
"Relationship status: actively looking."

27:38.120 --> 27:41.320
"Actively looking," bro?
"Actively looking?"

27:41.400 --> 27:43.440
Stereotypical male, you know?

27:43.520 --> 27:46.680
He's going to flirt with everybody.
I can already tell.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.320
I ship him with Ana Carla.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.640
He's going to hit on me.
I'll encourage him.

27:50.720 --> 27:52.960
I'll use my seduction game.

27:53.040 --> 27:54.480
I think it'll help me.

27:54.560 --> 27:56.880
"If you see a fire, just hit me up."

27:59.720 --> 28:02.600
I'm on fire, JP. Come and get me.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.040
Circle, open Lucas's profile.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.840
All right. Lucas is 25 years old.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.640
"Relationship status: single."

28:10.720 --> 28:12.720
Everybody is single, man.

28:12.800 --> 28:14.720
He looks like a surfer dude.

28:14.800 --> 28:16.720
He could shave the armpits

28:16.800 --> 28:19.520
and let the beard grow some more.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.640
"I'm a fun guy."

28:21.720 --> 28:24.320
Everybody says that, honey.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.560
Nobody would say, "I'm boring."

28:26.640 --> 28:30.760
"I like to spend time with my family,
work and drink. I'm only human, after all.

28:30.840 --> 28:32.640
That's true. We're only human.

28:32.720 --> 28:36.080
A typical boozer.
"Water eater," as people say in Bahia.

28:36.160 --> 28:39.560
He took a photo in his backyard.
He's a homebody.

28:39.640 --> 28:41.520
We can see the rug airing behind him.

28:41.600 --> 28:43.920
But who knows if Lucas is really Lucas.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
Circle, open Akel's profile.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.680
He looks like me.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.320
At least, the photo does.

28:50.400 --> 28:54.400
"I love Japanese food and astrology."
We can exchange some ideas.

28:54.480 --> 28:58.600
He loves astrology?
He probably doesn't know his rising sign.

28:58.680 --> 29:02.040
"I am a doctor."
This is exactly what I need.

29:02.120 --> 29:05.520
I feel a bit weak.
I need treatment, you know?

29:05.600 --> 29:11.360
Usually, doctors don't believe
in signs or astrology.

29:11.440 --> 29:13.520
Why are you lying, baby?

29:13.600 --> 29:15.240
Circle, open Julia's profile.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.000
She's got tattoos. I like her already.

29:19.080 --> 29:21.320
She looks gayer than Lorayne.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.280
Much gayer.

29:23.360 --> 29:26.760
Julia is older. A cougar.

29:26.840 --> 29:29.840
"Fire turns scrap metal into art

29:29.920 --> 29:32.280
and art into scrap metal.

29:32.360 --> 29:35.640
It all depends on you."

29:36.200 --> 29:37.640
Awful.

29:38.520 --> 29:40.560
Circle, open Marina's.

29:41.960 --> 29:44.440
I like her already. She's exciting.

29:44.520 --> 29:48.080
I love her hair.
I love when they have lots of hair.

29:48.160 --> 29:51.320
"I'm an adventurer.
I love meeting people, hip hop..."

29:51.400 --> 29:52.720
We'll get along.

29:53.480 --> 29:56.040
"A true <i>carioca,</i> I'm everywhere.

29:56.120 --> 29:58.960
I'm a singer.
One day, you will hear about me."

29:59.040 --> 30:01.840
Can you imagine
if she's a male singer instead?

30:01.920 --> 30:05.240
Circle, open Gaybol's profile.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.480
Gaybol? Is he gay?

30:09.000 --> 30:11.440
He is 26 years old. Wow, he looks younger!

30:12.960 --> 30:15.520
"In a relationship." Are you sure, dude?

30:15.600 --> 30:18.280
Nerd and relationships don't go together.

30:18.360 --> 30:20.080
I hope his girlfriend isn't a video game.

30:20.160 --> 30:25.080
"I love video games.
I have the best player two by my side."

30:26.680 --> 30:30.040
He looks crazy,
like those nerds who shout,

30:30.120 --> 30:32.040
"Shoot!"

30:33.160 --> 30:35.440
<i>They screened the profiles.</i>

30:35.520 --> 30:38.120
<i>Who are the most popular</i>
<i>among the players?</i>

30:38.200 --> 30:41.640
The moment of truth!

30:43.240 --> 30:45.320
I'm almost pulling out my nails.
I'm so nervous.

30:45.400 --> 30:47.560
Now I wonder. I have to think about it.

30:47.640 --> 30:52.080
People who are very different from me,
I have to rate them lower.

30:52.160 --> 30:55.080
Circle, start ratings.

30:55.160 --> 30:56.800
Let me start from the beginning.

30:56.880 --> 31:00.000
Circle, rate Marina as first place.

31:01.640 --> 31:04.120
Circle, Marina in fourth place.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.480
I didn't like Marina.
Maybe everybody liked her?

31:07.880 --> 31:10.800
Ana Carla in fourth place.

31:11.840 --> 31:14.440
I think she might like my profile.

31:14.520 --> 31:18.480
She's looking at me in such a way.
Anywhere I go, she's staring.

31:19.520 --> 31:23.360
The eighth place, unfortunately...
goes to Ana Carla.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.800
Her profile is very shallow.

31:26.880 --> 31:28.640
Gaybol in first place.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.200
Circle, let's put Gaybol in sixth place.

31:33.280 --> 31:35.480
He doesn't like to leave the house,
he looks crazy.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.320
Fourth place goes to Lucas.

31:37.400 --> 31:40.880
I don't think he's lying, I don't know.

31:40.960 --> 31:44.720
Put Lorayne in first... in the ratings.

31:44.800 --> 31:46.760
Beach girl, likes partying...

31:46.840 --> 31:48.080
We're soul mates.

31:48.160 --> 31:50.880
In first place, I'm gonna put Dumaresq.

31:50.960 --> 31:53.600
I think he's very authentic.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.640
In eighth place, Circle,

31:56.480 --> 31:59.240
please put JP.

31:59.600 --> 32:03.200
I think JP needs to go back home
and get some rest.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.320
And in last place...

32:05.400 --> 32:08.480
Julia. Who are you, Julia?

32:08.880 --> 32:10.360
Who are you, girl?

I don't like thirsty people.

That will be my strategy.

36:49.640 --> 36:51.200
Maybe after the game,

36:51.280 --> 36:54.360
if that's really her,
we'll get to know each other,

36:54.440 --> 36:56.040
and something will happen.

36:56.120 --> 36:58.040
Nice guy. I'm into him for real.

36:58.120 --> 37:02.160
I mean it. I'm up for it.
It's not a strategy.

37:02.240 --> 37:04.520
<i>Oh, I ship this couple.</i>

37:04.600 --> 37:07.400
<i>What should we name them?</i>
<i>AnaP or JCarla?</i>

37:09.840 --> 37:12.800
<i>The first day is over,</i>
<i>and they can get some rest.</i>

37:18.960 --> 37:21.240
Send the cattle back to the corral.

37:23.440 --> 37:26.840
Miss Paraíba's secret is being revealed.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.480
Good night, Circle.

37:38.400 --> 37:41.320
I always wanted
to clap my lights off. Maybe...

37:46.520 --> 37:47.840
Nice!

38:01.080 --> 38:03.040
Good morning, Circle.

38:03.120 --> 38:05.240
Good morning, Circle!

38:05.960 --> 38:07.240
We're awake!

38:07.320 --> 38:09.120
Another day, another dollar.

38:10.040 --> 38:12.240
I hope I don't get eliminated today!

38:16.040 --> 38:18.080
My strategy today is to approach

38:19.080 --> 38:21.960
one of the players
that stood out yesterday.

38:22.040 --> 38:24.720
I think it's a good strategy.

38:26.680 --> 38:29.640
-Wow, so warm.
-This place is so cute!

38:38.240 --> 38:41.360
Dumaresq sent a headtag
in the chat yesterday.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.280
It was "#GoodVibes."

38:43.360 --> 38:45.920
<i>-"Headtag?" You mean, hashtag.</i>
-Let's talk to him.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.280
"Hey, Dumaresq. What do you think
about the Carnival in Bahia?"

38:49.360 --> 38:53.000
Circle, create a group chat with Dumaresq,

38:53.080 --> 38:55.920
Lorayne, JP, and Marina.

38:59.640 --> 39:02.720
"Carnival Social."
No way, we have a group.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.680
AKEL HAS INVITED YOU
TO THE "CARNIVAL SOCIAL" CHAT

39:05.760 --> 39:09.080
Akel has invited me...
"Carnival Social."

39:11.600 --> 39:15.320
I'm shocked! I was just relaxing here.

39:15.400 --> 39:18.720
I accept it, though.
I want to join the group, Circle.

39:18.800 --> 39:20.280
"Carnival Social."

39:20.360 --> 39:22.320
So many emotions this early in the day.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.600
Circle, open chat with Akel.

39:24.680 --> 39:25.920
Good morning, guys.

39:26.000 --> 39:29.400
I saw that you love a party
and to socialize.

39:29.480 --> 39:32.560
Circle, send. Wow, it turned out perfect.

39:32.640 --> 39:36.000
Party is my middle name.

39:36.360 --> 39:37.640
Circle, message.

39:37.720 --> 39:40.760
I'm already excited. Hahaha.

39:40.840 --> 39:43.240
I'm even twerking in the ofuro tub.

39:45.120 --> 39:46.040
Send.

39:47.280 --> 39:50.640
She's even... tweerk?

39:51.440 --> 39:55.400
What is that? I need a dictionary, please.

39:55.480 --> 39:58.800
For Christ's sake.
I don't know what a toerk is.

39:58.880 --> 40:00.880
What is a tweerk?

40:03.400 --> 40:04.640
Circle, message.

40:04.720 --> 40:07.600
I created this group
so we can plan for the next Carnival.

40:07.680 --> 40:10.240
What do you think? Question mark.

40:10.320 --> 40:11.360
Yes!

40:11.440 --> 40:12.560
Send.

40:13.640 --> 40:16.600
It's my favorite time of the year.
Circle, message.

40:16.680 --> 40:22.040
Akel, I've been thinking about
the next Carnival since the last one.

40:22.120 --> 40:25.960
I can wear a different costume everyday.
I love it so much.

40:26.040 --> 40:28.000
Send!

40:29.120 --> 40:30.400
Circle, message.

40:30.480 --> 40:34.400
Girl, you can help me with outfits, then.

40:35.200 --> 40:39.920
Introduce me to some of your girlfriends.
LMAO. Sassy emoji.

40:40.000 --> 40:41.280
Circle, send.

40:42.280 --> 40:45.680
I'm really curious about something.

40:45.760 --> 40:47.920
Circle, message.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.880
Lorayne, what do you mean

40:50.960 --> 40:54.320
by me introducing you
to some of my girlfriends?

40:54.400 --> 40:55.920
Circle, message.

40:56.000 --> 41:00.320
Dumaresq, honey,
at a barbecue, I eat salad...

41:00.400 --> 41:01.600
"...and sausage."

41:03.440 --> 41:04.560
She's bi!

41:05.520 --> 41:06.720
Bi!

41:07.840 --> 41:10.480
"I eat salad and sausage?" Wow!

41:10.560 --> 41:12.000
Circle, message.

41:12.080 --> 41:16.000
The party is on. #DontGoAwayChat.

41:17.520 --> 41:20.480
I loved this morning chat.

41:20.560 --> 41:21.960
It warms things up.

41:22.040 --> 41:24.360
I would have added Ana Carla.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.320
She's a DJ, loves parties and music.

41:26.400 --> 41:30.440
But I'm not sure about her,
about some things in her profile.

41:30.520 --> 41:32.040
And she loves electronic music.

41:32.120 --> 41:34.920
I don't know if she'd have liked
the Bahia Carnival,

41:35.000 --> 41:38.040
with a bunch of sweaty people
and all that.

41:39.760 --> 41:43.920
<i>They'll gradually get to know each other,</i>
<i>forming bonds and severing ties.</i>

41:44.000 --> 41:46.520
<i>But the truth is,</i>
<i>no one is here to make friends.</i>

41:46.600 --> 41:50.720
<i>They are here to be popular</i>
<i>and take home the 67,000 dollars.</i>

41:53.920 --> 41:55.120
"Ice Breaker."

41:55.200 --> 41:56.880
Whoa, we're gonna play a game.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.520
I'm great with games.

41:58.600 --> 42:02.360
I will use my Northeastern heat
to melt this ice. Let's go.

42:02.440 --> 42:03.680
I'm ready.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.680
I love that question!

42:06.760 --> 42:08.960
"Do you know how to dance <i>quadradinho?"</i>

42:09.040 --> 42:10.480
No!

42:10.560 --> 42:14.040
Everybody will say yes,
and I'll be the only one who will say no.

42:14.120 --> 42:16.080
What? Of course.

42:16.160 --> 42:17.160
Check it out.

42:20.000 --> 42:21.200
I'm gonna try.

42:27.120 --> 42:28.040
No.

42:28.120 --> 42:29.640
YES
NO

42:29.720 --> 42:31.520
Let's see who knows how to do it.

42:31.600 --> 42:33.120
All the girls but me.

42:33.200 --> 42:34.360
I'm so mad!

42:34.440 --> 42:36.480
Julia said yes!

42:41.000 --> 42:43.080
"Have you ever revealed
someone else's secret?"

42:43.640 --> 42:44.720
Oh, shit.

42:44.800 --> 42:45.960
Circle, no.

42:47.320 --> 42:48.160
I hold my tongue.

42:50.000 --> 42:53.680
We're putting the cards on the table.

42:55.920 --> 42:57.960
Only three people said yes.

42:58.480 --> 43:00.600
Akel, Dumaresq, and Lorayne.

43:00.680 --> 43:02.720
Dumaresq is so honest, dude.

43:02.800 --> 43:04.360
I knew he wouldn't hide anything.

43:06.600 --> 43:08.240
Circle, message.

43:08.320 --> 43:10.840
In a conversation,

43:10.920 --> 43:13.520
everybody has let out
a secret or two unintentionally.

43:14.880 --> 43:18.360
Akel, this story about letting out
a secret unintentionally

43:18.440 --> 43:20.960
does not have me convinced, young man.

43:21.040 --> 43:24.440
Magnifying glass emoji.

43:25.440 --> 43:29.400
Look at her, playing detective.

43:29.480 --> 43:31.280
Little Miss Perfect.

43:31.360 --> 43:32.920
Hey, I'm being honest.

43:33.000 --> 43:36.120
If honesty serves any purpose in life,

43:36.760 --> 43:37.640
more power to me.

43:37.720 --> 43:41.200
<i>Are you being honest?</i>
<i>How old are you again, doctor?</i>

43:42.000 --> 43:43.800
Look, another question.

43:43.880 --> 43:46.160
"Have you ever sent nudes?"

43:48.040 --> 43:51.680
There we go.
I love talking about dirty stuff.

43:51.760 --> 43:55.280
Your biggest mistake is saying
you're gonna take a shower.

43:55.360 --> 43:57.560
Circle, my answer is "yes."

43:57.640 --> 44:00.960
Julia loves to send nudes to people.

44:01.040 --> 44:03.720
I'm too old for this,

44:03.800 --> 44:06.080
so I don't do this stuff, man.

44:06.640 --> 44:08.240
Whoever says no is a liar.

44:08.320 --> 44:11.440
People who haven't sent any nudes
can cast the first stone.

44:12.960 --> 44:15.400
Everybody has sent nudes.

44:16.400 --> 44:18.960
-Of course.
-You're all crazy.

44:19.040 --> 44:20.960
You can't withhold your nudes.

44:21.040 --> 44:22.040
Circle, message.

44:22.120 --> 44:27.080
In long-distance relationships,
nudes are an essential tool.

44:27.160 --> 44:28.240
Send.

44:28.320 --> 44:31.960
Look, we have a new information:
Akel had a long-distance relationship.

44:32.040 --> 44:34.120
I have many friends in medical school.

44:34.800 --> 44:38.400
At some point, they all have
a long-distance relationship.

44:38.480 --> 44:42.440
Akel is turning out to be a real guy.

44:42.520 --> 44:45.640
Circle, message. I'm floored!

44:45.720 --> 44:48.440
"They put a bunch of pervs in this game.

44:48.520 --> 44:50.800
#SendNudes. #AuntieWillTakeThem."

44:51.440 --> 44:53.240
I love that woman.

44:53.320 --> 44:58.120
Julia is too much, dude.
She's so awesome.

44:58.200 --> 45:00.000
"AuntieWillTakeThem."

45:05.000 --> 45:06.800
"Auntie" again.

45:06.880 --> 45:09.520
I bet people are getting tired
of this Auntie thing.

45:10.080 --> 45:13.320
Dude, "Auntie" is her trademark already.

45:15.280 --> 45:17.440
-"Congratulations, you broke the ice."
-"You broke the ice."

45:17.520 --> 45:20.240
Awesome. We totally broke the ice today.

45:20.320 --> 45:22.440
Cool, I loved it.

45:22.520 --> 45:25.240
These people are crazy. I love it.

45:26.120 --> 45:30.040
<i>The game is warming up, and people</i>
<i>are already planning strategies.</i>

45:30.120 --> 45:31.160
<i>Who am I to judge?</i>

45:37.440 --> 45:41.880
Once again, Dumaresq stole the scene
when we played the game.

45:41.960 --> 45:44.360
He's a very strong player.

45:44.920 --> 45:47.800
I need to try chatting with him privately.

45:47.880 --> 45:51.280
Circle, open private chat with Dumaresq.

45:51.840 --> 45:53.840
AKEL HAS INVITED YOU TO A PRIVATE CHAT

45:53.920 --> 45:55.240
Oh, my God.

45:55.320 --> 45:58.640
Circle, open private chat with Akel.

45:59.760 --> 46:02.200
He accepted it! Nice!

46:02.480 --> 46:05.200
Let's see what you're gonna say.
I'm curious.

46:05.280 --> 46:06.720
Circle, message.

46:06.800 --> 46:09.960
Dude, it's great having you here!
Two exclamation marks.

46:10.040 --> 46:12.680
One of my best friends is a lot like you.

46:12.760 --> 46:15.120
Your profile was very reassuring to me.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.800
Circle, send.

46:17.560 --> 46:20.160
That's so cute.

46:20.520 --> 46:22.200
The two of us.

46:23.840 --> 46:25.440
Circle, message.

46:25.880 --> 46:28.320
That's so cool!

46:28.400 --> 46:30.440
You can be my best friend too.

46:32.520 --> 46:33.880
Nice.

46:34.320 --> 46:35.800
Circle, message.

46:35.880 --> 46:40.440
Akel, why didn't you add more players
to the Carnival Social Chat?

46:40.520 --> 46:43.960
#Julia. #Ana. Only those.

46:44.040 --> 46:46.040
I don't care about the rest.

46:46.120 --> 46:46.960
Send.

46:47.720 --> 46:50.920
I like them both. Especially Ana Carla.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.560
Devil emoji.

46:52.640 --> 46:56.280
But I don't know if she's a catfish.
What do you think about her?

46:56.360 --> 46:57.480
Circle, send.

47:00.080 --> 47:04.400
I think Akel wants to be careful,

47:04.480 --> 47:09.040
and that's great
because we have some catfish here.

47:09.120 --> 47:11.160
Circle, message.

47:11.240 --> 47:13.280
I was thinking about that.

47:13.360 --> 47:18.400
I reckon a catfish, "in theory,"
doesn't want to draw attention.

47:18.480 --> 47:20.120
If you were a catfish,

47:20.200 --> 47:23.240
would you have used
that fabulous photo Ana Carla added?

47:23.320 --> 47:25.480
Question mark. Send.

47:26.080 --> 47:27.960
I couldn't have said it better.

47:28.040 --> 47:30.960
I wouldn't have used
a fabulous photo like that one.

47:31.040 --> 47:33.960
That photo is really fabulous.
Circle, message.

47:34.040 --> 47:37.520
How about this? If we find something out,
we can inform each other.

47:37.600 --> 47:40.280
Do we have a deal? Send.

47:40.360 --> 47:43.360
Look at that! Nice, I'm in.

47:43.920 --> 47:46.120
Circle, message. Akel,

47:46.200 --> 47:48.760
I'll keep my eyes peeled. Period.

47:48.840 --> 47:50.720
Hugs. See you soon.

47:51.080 --> 47:52.560
#GoodVibes.

47:53.400 --> 47:57.080
If I have this guy on my side,
it'll be great.

47:57.160 --> 47:59.440
Now I know he's suspicious of Ana.

48:01.800 --> 48:04.560
We have a target. A two-in-one target.

48:04.640 --> 48:06.560
This is an advantage for me
at this moment.

48:06.640 --> 48:07.640
At this moment.

48:13.320 --> 48:14.600
<i>After a few chats,</i>

48:14.680 --> 48:17.720
<i>I can't wait to see</i>
<i>who are the most popular in the game.</i>

48:20.960 --> 48:22.120
-Alert!
-Alert.

48:22.200 --> 48:24.400
I just got butterflies in my stomach.

48:24.480 --> 48:25.520
Oh, God.

48:26.040 --> 48:27.960
Oh, my God!

48:29.880 --> 48:31.640
THE RATING RESULTS ARE IN

48:31.720 --> 48:32.920
Jesus Christ!

48:33.000 --> 48:35.320
"The rating results are in."

48:35.400 --> 48:37.480
I've got goosebumps.

48:37.560 --> 48:38.600
It's time.

48:40.120 --> 48:41.440
I'm fine.

48:48.640 --> 48:50.600
Let's go, hurry!

48:53.760 --> 48:56.520
Shit. They crushed us.

48:56.600 --> 48:58.280
What? I'm ninth?

48:58.360 --> 49:00.920
What? And JP is eighth!

49:01.000 --> 49:03.200
Bunch of intolerant people!

49:03.640 --> 49:05.960
Yeah. They are all cruel.

49:06.760 --> 49:10.680
Ana, with her impossibly
turquoise blue eyes,

49:10.760 --> 49:11.760
is kinda suspicious.

49:11.840 --> 49:15.560
Nobody posts perfect photos
right off the bat. It's always like that.

49:15.640 --> 49:18.320
This always happens to me. People...

49:18.400 --> 49:20.400
judge me without even knowing me.

49:22.480 --> 49:23.480
I'm so mad!

49:23.560 --> 49:26.680
I knew it. JP must be thinking, "Fuck.

49:26.760 --> 49:28.440
They know the truth."

49:28.520 --> 49:30.320
Do they think I'm a catfish?

49:30.400 --> 49:33.280
Dude, I doubt you're a man.
I bet you're a woman.

49:35.160 --> 49:37.400
I was so happy to have gotten in here.

49:41.400 --> 49:43.160
I don't want to leave!

49:46.160 --> 49:48.240
I think I'm probably third or fourth.

49:48.320 --> 49:49.720
I'm being optimistic.

49:50.880 --> 49:54.360
I haven't felt this nervous
since I got my driver's license.

49:55.680 --> 49:56.640
Oh, God!

50:00.640 --> 50:01.520
Shit!

50:01.960 --> 50:04.400
Let's not panic. No reason to panic.

50:04.480 --> 50:07.320
Gaybol. Honey, I told you.

50:07.400 --> 50:10.560
You admit you like to play,
while in a competition?

50:10.640 --> 50:12.200
Gaybol in seventh place?

50:12.760 --> 50:14.240
Better you than me.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.560
I have to talk more,

50:16.640 --> 50:18.160
use more slang,

50:18.240 --> 50:21.640
and bond with everybody
because this rating is too low.

50:21.720 --> 50:22.960
This is crazy!

50:23.040 --> 50:26.040
I'm drinking champagne tonight
to celebrate being in the game.

50:27.520 --> 50:29.080
Julia must be fifth place.

50:29.160 --> 50:32.160
Unbelievable. What did people see in her?

50:32.240 --> 50:35.720
Wow, Mouse! We are doing really well!

50:35.800 --> 50:37.640
I think it'll be Lorayne and Julia.

50:37.720 --> 50:39.400
Akel is in this one for sure.

50:39.480 --> 50:41.400
He couldn't be in a better place.

50:44.240 --> 50:47.440
Wow, Mouse. I am relieved.
This is actually great.

50:47.520 --> 50:48.680
Fourth place!

50:48.760 --> 50:51.320
Cool! It could've been better.

50:52.680 --> 50:54.800
I'm top three!

50:54.880 --> 50:56.120
I'm gonna cry, girl.

50:56.480 --> 50:59.080
I'm nervous. I want to laugh and cry
at the same time.

51:02.520 --> 51:05.880
I'm in the top three!

51:08.040 --> 51:11.440
<i>Marina, Lorayne, and Dumaresq</i>
<i>are the top three.</i>

51:13.360 --> 51:17.400
I am shaking, girl!

51:17.480 --> 51:20.920
Brace yourselves, everybody!

51:21.000 --> 51:24.040
<i>But only two of them</i>
<i>can become influencers.</i>

51:24.120 --> 51:26.160
Oh, my God!

51:30.640 --> 51:32.400
Fuck yeah!

51:32.480 --> 51:33.720
I feel like dancing.

51:36.960 --> 51:40.440
<i>I'm one of the two</i>

51:40.520 --> 51:42.440
<i>Best rated players</i>

51:42.520 --> 51:43.600
Take that!

51:45.560 --> 51:46.920
That split.

51:47.640 --> 51:49.400
I knew it!

51:49.480 --> 51:51.600
I knew it!

51:51.680 --> 51:54.000
Well done, baby girl!

52:10.920 --> 52:12.280
Am I seeing things?

52:18.800 --> 52:21.120
First place!

52:27.360 --> 52:28.240
I was right.

52:29.240 --> 52:31.720
Dumaresq, first. Marina, second.

52:31.800 --> 52:35.880
They're like twins,
their vibes are identical.

52:35.960 --> 52:39.120
All the girls are up there, and I am last.

52:40.240 --> 52:41.960
<i>The Circle Brazil!</i>

52:42.040 --> 52:44.720
<i>From now on,</i>
<i>it's best to use your brains, princess.</i>

52:44.800 --> 52:46.280
<i>Otherwise, the crown will fall.</i>

52:48.080 --> 52:49.760
Alert!

52:49.840 --> 52:51.640
Shit, alert!

52:51.720 --> 52:54.040
When that comes up on the screen,

52:54.120 --> 52:56.440
you better brace yourselves!

52:58.680 --> 53:00.440
"As the most popular players,

53:00.520 --> 53:04.600
Dumaresq and Marina
are now <i>The Circle</i> influencers."

53:04.680 --> 53:07.240
Yes, bitches. Did you hear that?

53:07.320 --> 53:08.680
Congratulations to both of you.

53:10.640 --> 53:13.480
"All other players failed

53:13.560 --> 53:15.640
and are at risk of being blocked."

53:15.720 --> 53:18.720
I thought only the bottom two
could be blocked, dude.

53:18.800 --> 53:21.920
That was my fear, Mouse.

53:23.480 --> 53:26.640
"The influencers must decide
who they will block."

53:27.240 --> 53:29.320
What do you mean, we must decide?

53:31.200 --> 53:34.560
"Dumaresq and Marina, please go
to the Blue Room to make your decision."

53:35.400 --> 53:38.960
Marina, dude.
We got along. Help me out.

53:40.120 --> 53:44.000
"All other players must go
to the At Risk Chat."

53:45.400 --> 53:46.440
They'll run their mouths.

53:46.520 --> 53:51.680
Holy crap. Talking to them right now
is going to be stressful.

53:51.760 --> 53:54.200
Relax, everything will be fine.

53:54.280 --> 53:56.080
Everything will be fine!

53:56.160 --> 53:58.360
Whatever will be will be.

53:59.040 --> 54:02.160
That is my new hashtag. Excuse me.

54:02.240 --> 54:05.400
I have to dress for the occasion.

54:05.480 --> 54:08.120
Let's do this. It's time.

54:10.920 --> 54:13.120
Did you think I was kidding?

54:13.720 --> 54:17.080
You better respect me. Check it out.

54:25.520 --> 54:29.280
<i>I wouldn't want to be in Marina</i>
<i>and Dumaresq's place right now.</i>

54:29.360 --> 54:32.240
<i>I also wouldn't want to be the player</i>
<i>they're gonna block.</i>

54:37.080 --> 54:39.680
My crown fell off. I'm excited!

54:39.760 --> 54:42.040
Calm down, Marina!

54:42.120 --> 54:43.720
This place is fancy.

54:49.720 --> 54:53.840
It looks like a fortune teller's table.
This green tablecloth...

54:55.120 --> 54:57.160
This is actually almost the case.

54:57.240 --> 55:00.520
Somebody's fate will be decided here.

55:03.880 --> 55:05.640
Shit, it's about to go down.

55:06.240 --> 55:09.080
Circle, message.

55:09.800 --> 55:12.880

55:13.680 --> 55:17.040
I'm very happy that you are here with me.

55:17.120 --> 55:18.200
Send.

55:18.720 --> 55:20.080
I love it!

55:20.760 --> 55:22.280
This is incredible.

Circle, message.

55:24.360 --> 55:25.920
How about...

55:26.000 --> 55:29.720
we analyze every single player,

55:29.800 --> 55:32.480
so we can come to a decision?

55:32.560 --> 55:35.720
Great idea, girlfriend. I'm gonna start.

55:35.800 --> 55:39.960
Lucas got a terrible rating

55:40.040 --> 55:43.400
but I think it's a result

55:43.480 --> 55:45.960
of his bad communication skills.

55:46.960 --> 55:49.720
What do you think about him?
Question mark.

55:49.800 --> 55:51.000
Send.

55:52.040 --> 55:54.960
Nice. Circle, message.

55:55.040 --> 55:57.480

55:57.560 --> 56:00.040

Period. Send.

Circle, message.

56:05.360 --> 56:10.280
Do you know who I don't trust? Gaybol.

56:10.840 --> 56:14.920
He declared himself a player,
and I'm scared of him.

56:15.000 --> 56:16.320
Send!

56:16.400 --> 56:19.560
I think Gaybol is a cutie, but...

56:21.360 --> 56:23.800
maybe Gaybol isn't Gaybol.

56:24.560 --> 56:26.600
Crap.

56:28.800 --> 56:30.440
Circle, message.

56:31.080 --> 56:34.280
What about Ana Carla? She's adorable,

56:34.960 --> 56:37.560
but too perfect.

56:37.640 --> 56:38.760
Send.

56:39.720 --> 56:42.480
I don't know, but I also think the same.

56:43.040 --> 56:45.000
She doesn't have a lot of depth.

56:45.080 --> 56:49.320
There is not a lot of intricacy either
in Ana Carla.

56:49.400 --> 56:51.440
What do you think about Julia?

56:51.800 --> 56:55.040
The only thing I know
is that she makes...

56:56.240 --> 56:57.320
knives.

56:57.680 --> 57:01.040
"And she's hitting on everybody."
I've noticed that too.

57:01.120 --> 57:03.600
"#MysteriousAuntie."

57:03.680 --> 57:04.960
Exactly.

57:05.560 --> 57:07.800
I'm tired of this Auntie thing.

57:09.400 --> 57:10.840
This is stressful.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.920
<i>There are some people missing</i>
<i>from this conversation.</i>

57:15.480 --> 57:17.520
<i>Could they be the protégés?</i>

57:21.800 --> 57:24.960
"At Risk Chat is now open."

57:25.600 --> 57:27.080
What a harsh name.

57:27.160 --> 57:29.320

Exclamation mark.

57:53.200 --> 57:55.680

58:03.280 --> 58:06.280
If you're not a catfish,
your biggest problem

58:06.360 --> 58:09.200
is that you're too pretty.
It intimidates people.

58:09.280 --> 58:12.680
On social media, people don't accept you
because you might be a catfish.

58:12.760 --> 58:14.480
Circle, message.

58:14.560 --> 58:17.640
I'm still hoping they say that was a joke,

58:17.720 --> 58:19.320
that no one is leaving yet.

58:19.400 --> 58:22.280
#Faith. Circle, send.

58:23.600 --> 58:26.480
Is this going to be my day
to pack up and leave?

58:26.560 --> 58:28.120
Better someone else than me.

58:28.200 --> 58:29.360
I'm crossing my fingers...

58:31.320 --> 58:32.320
and...

58:32.920 --> 58:34.840
praying I won't get blocked.

58:37.880 --> 58:41.680

59:06.800 --> 59:08.480
Whatever happens, happens.

59:17.360 --> 59:19.720
Alert. Oh, my God.

59:19.800 --> 59:21.560

59:21.640 --> 59:23.920
Who got blocked, who didn't?

59:24.000 --> 59:25.320
It could be us, man.

59:27.800 --> 59:31.200
"The influencers
have made their decision."

59:32.280 --> 59:34.840
Everybody must be freaking out.

"All players must go to the Circle Chat."

Circle, message.

59:49.680 --> 59:51.800
Dumaresq is messaging something.

59:52.200 --> 59:54.360
They're dropping the bomb right now.

59:56.760 --> 59:59.600
Whatever will be, will be, dude.

1:00:01.040 --> 1:00:04.200
As influencers,
it was hard to make a decision.

1:00:04.760 --> 1:00:06.960
"Not only because
it's the first rating..."

1:00:07.040 --> 1:00:09.960
"...but also because
this is a dream for some."

1:00:10.040 --> 1:00:12.400
I agree, dude. Oh, my God.

1:00:12.480 --> 1:00:14.320
Please.

1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:16.800
Yeah, this is a dream
for a bunch of people.

1:00:17.360 --> 1:00:19.160
Due to lack of dialogue

1:00:19.240 --> 1:00:23.680
and suspicions of catfishing...

1:00:24.240 --> 1:00:25.520
Fuck me!

1:00:27.080 --> 1:00:28.720
Oh no, Mouse.

1:00:30.440 --> 1:00:31.360
I don't want to look.

1:00:33.760 --> 1:00:35.880
The blocked person is...

1:00:37.040 --> 1:00:38.120
Please.

1:00:38.200 --> 1:00:40.040
I'm closing my eyes.
I don't want to look.
