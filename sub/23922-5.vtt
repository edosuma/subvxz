00:16.972 --> 00:19.082
Evening.

00:19.085 --> 00:21.554
All right.

00:21.557 --> 00:24.605
Eh, we're getting reports
some mutt is casing residences

00:24.606 --> 00:26.070
by, uh, McKinley Park.

00:26.073 --> 00:28.336
Now, we got our numbers
on break-ins down

00:28.339 --> 00:31.204
last month, so special
attention there, all right?

00:31.205 --> 00:33.338
Uh... some complaints

00:33.339 --> 00:36.132
regarding RMPs double-parked
in front of Portillo's.

00:36.135 --> 00:39.207
If you're there on dinner break,
find someplace else to park.

00:39.210 --> 00:40.937
Well, what if it's not
on our dinner break?

00:40.938 --> 00:42.571
Moving on.

00:42.572 --> 00:45.971
Uh... All right, listen up.

00:45.972 --> 00:47.867
"Pursuant to a consent decree

00:47.870 --> 00:49.653
between the City and various plaintiffs

00:49.656 --> 00:52.101
suing for actions alleged
to have been taken by members

00:52.104 --> 00:53.820
of the Chicago Police Department,

00:53.823 --> 00:57.369
attorneys from firms so
designated by a magistrate

00:57.372 --> 01:01.703
will be granted access to
CPD operations in the field."

01:01.706 --> 01:03.692
And that means?

01:03.695 --> 01:06.138
We got company. There's
some lawyers here

01:06.139 --> 01:08.338
who'll be doing ride-alongs tonight.

01:08.339 --> 01:11.138
Uh... as the chief of
patrol has directed,

01:11.139 --> 01:13.171
the department will
be in full compliance

01:13.172 --> 01:15.668
with the terms of said consent decree.

01:15.671 --> 01:17.140
The following units

01:17.143 --> 01:19.942
will have one such attorney
riding along with them:

01:19.945 --> 01:22.962
uh... Sector Charlie.

01:22.965 --> 01:25.460
And Sector David.

01:26.585 --> 01:28.184
Come on, let's remember,

01:28.187 --> 01:31.038
we're on the same side
with this. All right?

01:31.039 --> 01:32.445
That's it.

01:32.448 --> 01:34.981
Be safe.

01:36.472 --> 01:37.914
Here we go.

01:37.917 --> 01:41.325
There's one for you and one for you.

01:41.328 --> 01:42.757
Liability waiver?

01:42.760 --> 01:44.770
It's for our lawyers.
I'm sure you understand.

01:44.773 --> 01:45.637
"The undersigned

01:45.640 --> 01:48.338
hereby agrees to assume the
risk of death, personal injury,

01:48.339 --> 01:49.914
and/or property damage."

01:49.917 --> 01:52.286
I wouldn't worry too much
about that with Charlie Sector.

01:52.289 --> 01:53.904
What about David Sector?

01:53.905 --> 01:56.372
Make sure you sign all the pages.

01:59.406 --> 02:01.168
- We can always change sectors.
- No.

02:01.171 --> 02:03.062
No, no, no. I'm up for it.

02:03.065 --> 02:04.731
- Maia Rindell. Let's go.
- Yes.

02:04.734 --> 02:06.904
- Put this on.
- Wh... is this a bulletproof vest?

02:06.905 --> 02:09.204
No, it's a stab-proof vest.

02:09.205 --> 02:12.605
Protects against knives
and, uh, thrown acid.

02:12.606 --> 02:15.439
- Oh. Fun times.
- Yeah.

02:17.150 --> 02:19.706
- Lucca Quinn? This way.
- Yeah.

02:19.709 --> 02:21.576
Okay.

02:32.570 --> 02:36.789
_

02:38.087 --> 02:39.653
The move has provoked

02:39.656 --> 02:41.942
widespread protests
throughout the Middle East,

02:41.945 --> 02:44.538
with Hezbollah leader,
Hassan Nasrallah, calling it

02:44.539 --> 02:46.505
"undisguised American aggression."

02:46.506 --> 02:48.856
In response, President Trump tweeted,

02:48.859 --> 02:50.271
"Mr. Nasrallah looks like

02:50.272 --> 02:52.371
a stupid fat Santa in a turban..."

02:52.372 --> 02:53.405
German Chancellor Merkel

02:53.406 --> 02:55.473
called the comment by
the American president:

02:55.476 --> 02:56.371
"Unhelpful..."

02:56.372 --> 02:58.051
I do the most

02:58.054 --> 03:00.234
least amount of bragging...

03:00.237 --> 03:02.465
word "house" instead of "hole."

03:02.468 --> 03:03.605
As in, "shit house..."

03:03.606 --> 03:05.438
tropical storm Don Jr.

03:05.439 --> 03:07.778
About to make landfall
in Cuba, and on the...

03:07.781 --> 03:10.438
new species of fungus
named covfefe originalis,

03:10.439 --> 03:11.812
after the president's...

03:11.815 --> 03:14.309
piece from the Ivanka Trump collection.

03:14.312 --> 03:16.481
And here's a really
nice piece from the...

03:16.484 --> 03:19.204
Now let's see how our
friends on the farm are doing.

03:19.205 --> 03:20.536
I'm tired.

03:20.539 --> 03:22.405
I can't sleep either.

03:22.406 --> 03:24.610
We'll have to count
little boys and girls.

03:24.613 --> 03:27.278
How can you sleep when
Donald Trump is president?

03:27.281 --> 03:28.971
Just look at North Korea.

03:28.972 --> 03:31.171
They've got their missiles
pointed right at us, and...

03:31.172 --> 03:33.933
Are you tired of being
tired? Sick of being sick?

03:37.726 --> 03:40.937
- Hello?
- Hey, invite me over right now.

03:40.938 --> 03:42.304
Tully?

03:42.305 --> 03:45.038
Yeah. Come on. Let's
have a glass of wine.

03:45.039 --> 03:46.904
Tully, I'm in bed.

03:46.905 --> 03:49.904
Ooh. What're you wearing?

03:49.905 --> 03:52.871
We said it was a one-night thing, Tully.

03:52.872 --> 03:55.153
Where are you? It sounds
like someone's being killed.

03:55.156 --> 03:57.359
I'm downtown.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.408
The police are overreacting.

03:59.411 --> 04:01.043
Hey, guys, keep it down.

04:01.046 --> 04:02.171
I'm on the phone.

04:02.172 --> 04:03.715
What are you protesting now?

04:03.718 --> 04:06.817
Come on down and find out.
It's, uh, very exciting.

04:06.820 --> 04:09.971
No. I think I'm in for the night.

04:09.972 --> 04:12.020
- Um, stay safe.
- Diane.

04:12.023 --> 04:15.778
Now wait. You know we-we had
something great going, right?

04:17.139 --> 04:20.978
That's my call-waiting. Good night.

04:20.982 --> 04:22.981
- Who is that, your other lover?
- Good night.

04:22.984 --> 04:24.403
Don't kill anyone.

04:24.406 --> 04:26.271
Hello?

04:26.272 --> 04:28.957
Still me. See, I think
subconsciously you wanted it

04:28.960 --> 04:30.325
to be me...

04:30.328 --> 04:31.904
- Hello?
- Diane.

04:31.905 --> 04:33.138
Sorry to call you at home.

04:33.139 --> 04:34.723
Oh, no, I'm awake.

04:34.726 --> 04:37.171
The network wants to broadcast
something on its morning show,

04:37.172 --> 04:38.937
and they're getting some pushback.

04:38.938 --> 04:40.238
We're outside counsel

04:40.239 --> 04:42.138
and we only have eight
hours to sort this out.

04:42.139 --> 04:44.171
Well, who's the pushback coming from?

04:44.172 --> 04:46.528
Old friend of yours.

04:49.500 --> 04:51.731
- Mr. Burl Preston.
- Yes, it's me.

04:51.734 --> 04:53.799
And I've forgotten your name.

04:53.800 --> 04:55.566
- Diane Lockhart.
- Diane.

04:55.567 --> 04:58.148
And this is my partner
in crime, Adrian Boseman.

04:58.151 --> 04:59.483
Mr. Preston.

04:59.486 --> 05:01.117
I heard your house burned down.

05:01.120 --> 05:03.553
I'm sorry. Dangers of canyon living.

05:03.556 --> 05:05.499
Don't cry for me, I have two more.

05:05.500 --> 05:08.899
And I heard clients are
killing lawyers in Chicago.

05:08.900 --> 05:10.466
Yes, one or two.

05:10.467 --> 05:11.733
Well, you're taking it well.

05:11.734 --> 05:13.772
Well, Chicago. We're used to worse.

05:13.775 --> 05:16.200
Uh, we're just in with our
clients right now, Mr. Preston.

05:16.203 --> 05:17.632
We'll be out to get
you in a few minutes.

05:17.633 --> 05:18.817
Sure, I'll just sit here.

05:18.820 --> 05:21.833
After four hours jetting
into a snowstorm, why not?

05:21.834 --> 05:23.382
I got all the time in the world.

05:23.385 --> 05:25.084
You're the ones who are in such a hurry

05:25.087 --> 05:26.201
to air this nonsense.

05:26.204 --> 05:28.536
It's not a black and
white situation, Greg.

05:28.539 --> 05:30.666
There are photos of the
woman arm-in-arm with him.

05:30.667 --> 05:31.933
- Is he here?
- Yeah.

05:31.934 --> 05:33.299
Is he mad?

05:33.300 --> 05:34.804
What?

05:34.807 --> 05:36.599
Is it gonna be a testy negotiation?

05:36.600 --> 05:39.343
I don't think it's going
to be a negotiation at all.

05:39.346 --> 05:41.309
This is a First Amendment issue.

05:41.312 --> 05:44.000
You have a news story. It's
yours to broadcast or not.

05:44.003 --> 05:45.109
Unless it's defamatory.

05:45.112 --> 05:46.631
- Well, there's no reason...
- Well, let's not get

05:46.633 --> 05:47.666
ahead of ourselves, okay?

05:48.800 --> 05:52.629
Okay, okay, okay, wait.
Carter is our in-house counsel.

05:52.632 --> 05:54.499
He keeps us from doing anything stupid.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.833
Reddick/Boseman,

05:55.834 --> 05:58.165
you defend us if we end
up doing anything stupid.

05:58.166 --> 06:00.833
So we all have a role here.

06:00.834 --> 06:02.566
And we have seven hours to figure out

06:02.567 --> 06:04.466
whether to broadcast this story.

06:04.467 --> 06:06.267
So let's start.

06:19.633 --> 06:20.899
So what's this about?

06:20.900 --> 06:24.046
You stay with us, and
give us a report card?

06:24.049 --> 06:26.532
Yeah. And offer suggestions on the law

06:26.533 --> 06:28.799
and how it can be obeyed.

06:28.800 --> 06:30.833
And, what, we get, like,
a grade on our windshield?

06:30.834 --> 06:32.733
- Like those restaurants?
- And everybody avoids

06:32.734 --> 06:34.859
getting arrested by a car with a "C."

06:36.467 --> 06:38.532
So you do this every night?

06:38.533 --> 06:41.199
No, once a month.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.382
And other lawyers from other
firms follow other cops.

06:44.385 --> 06:46.918
Aren't you guys dodging
bullets these days?

06:46.921 --> 06:48.653
That's right. People hate you lawyers.

06:48.656 --> 06:49.968
I thought we were hated.

06:49.971 --> 06:52.604
It's overblown. It
was just a few lawyers.

06:52.607 --> 06:54.835
What about that lawyer that
hanged himself yesterday?

06:54.838 --> 06:56.570
You know, people aren't
thinking he did it,

06:56.573 --> 06:57.739
it was done to him.

06:57.742 --> 06:59.632
Who was that?

06:59.633 --> 07:01.699
I don't know his name.

07:01.700 --> 07:03.173
It was over in Highland Park,

07:03.176 --> 07:04.914
- I think.
- Hey.

07:04.917 --> 07:07.082
Here comes the big action for the night.

07:07.085 --> 07:08.789
Get ready.

07:18.330 --> 07:19.663
There it is!

07:19.664 --> 07:22.930
- Every single night.
- Readjusting the package.

07:28.101 --> 07:33.075
_

07:33.078 --> 07:34.928
RMP Eleven-Thirty-Nine.

07:34.931 --> 07:36.530
Code Three pursuit of a white,

07:36.531 --> 07:38.663
late-model Camaro, Tennessee tags,

07:38.664 --> 07:41.075
"Three, Six, Tom, Victor, David."

07:43.064 --> 07:44.463
vicinity of Code Five.

08:11.633 --> 08:12.664
Aah.

08:54.026 --> 08:56.058
The list of prominent men accused

08:56.061 --> 08:57.760
of sexual harassment continues to grow

08:57.763 --> 08:59.820
even six months after Harvey Weinstein.

08:59.823 --> 09:01.166
Now the biggest

09:01.169 --> 09:02.895
and potentially most explosive name

09:02.898 --> 09:05.363
has been added to the
list. Kip Dunning...

09:05.364 --> 09:07.985
- Pause here.
- "Please."

09:07.988 --> 09:09.856
Please.

09:09.859 --> 09:11.934
We obviously object to the story

09:11.937 --> 09:13.496
top to bottom, and will immediately

09:13.497 --> 09:15.796
sue for damages, but I want to point out

09:15.797 --> 09:19.396
how sloppy this story is. "Alleged."

09:19.397 --> 09:20.730
Where is the word "alleged"?

09:20.731 --> 09:22.181
- So you'd like that added to the copy?
- No.

09:22.183 --> 09:23.438
As I already stated,

09:23.441 --> 09:25.895
this whole story is
defamatory and should be cut.

09:25.898 --> 09:27.730
So can we move on, please?

09:27.738 --> 09:29.771
Certainly. Play.

09:32.131 --> 09:33.763
Please.

09:33.766 --> 09:35.496
Kip Dunning

09:35.497 --> 09:37.630
is an actor with a
reputation rarely matched

09:37.631 --> 09:39.789
- in the Hollywood firmament...
- Oh, come on.

09:39.792 --> 09:43.469
Talk about cynical. You use
a still... Pause, please.

09:43.472 --> 09:45.618
And notice "please."

09:45.621 --> 09:47.287
You use a still

09:47.290 --> 09:50.552
from an action movie to suggest
Kip is aggressive to women.

09:50.555 --> 09:51.891
This is the nicest actor

09:51.894 --> 09:52.926
on the face of the earth,

09:52.929 --> 09:54.669
and you place him in
a defamatory light...

09:54.672 --> 09:56.763
You want us to change
out the photo? Great.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.765
- I'm sure we can do that.
- My individual issues

09:58.768 --> 10:00.883
in no way undercut the main point:

10:00.886 --> 10:03.665
this report is defamatory.

10:03.668 --> 10:07.141
Please, if you'd be so kind, play.

10:09.117 --> 10:12.584
And now two women have come
forward to accuse Dunning

10:12.587 --> 10:15.730
of both sexual assault and rape.

10:15.731 --> 10:17.763
He told me I'd have a career.

10:17.766 --> 10:19.365
He said everybody did it.

10:19.368 --> 10:20.877
- This was my idol...
- Okay, here it is.

10:20.879 --> 10:21.912
Stop, please.

10:21.915 --> 10:23.963
You use an anonymous woman,

10:23.964 --> 10:25.668
someone Kip can't confront,

10:25.671 --> 10:27.930
to charge him with forced oral rape.

10:27.931 --> 10:31.262
That, to put it simply, is bullshit.

10:31.265 --> 10:32.696
The reporter did a thorough check...

10:32.697 --> 10:35.598
We all know that these
days, even the whisper

10:35.601 --> 10:37.348
of a sexual harassment charge

10:37.351 --> 10:39.597
ruins a career for life.

10:39.600 --> 10:41.571
Yes, and that's why this story was sent

10:41.574 --> 10:43.257
to Kip, so he or his representatives

10:43.260 --> 10:44.259
could comment on it.

10:44.262 --> 10:46.097
We're willing to put
his comment in the story.

10:46.098 --> 10:47.496
And we're willing to
address your objections

10:47.497 --> 10:48.863
by re-editing the story.

10:53.919 --> 10:57.173
My objection is you're being used.

10:57.176 --> 10:59.429
Sexual harassment is
no longer the province

10:59.430 --> 11:02.316
of "MeToo" hashtags. It's
being used politically.

11:02.319 --> 11:05.009
And Kip has made so many
enemies among the alt-right,

11:05.012 --> 11:07.963
this is a hack job from them.

11:07.964 --> 11:09.663
We've invited the reporter in

11:09.664 --> 11:12.063
to defend her report, so please
stick around, Mr. Preston.

11:12.064 --> 11:15.032
Sure. I'm still on L.A. time.

11:15.035 --> 11:17.354
It's only 9:00 p.m. to me.

11:17.357 --> 11:20.189
Thank you.

11:20.192 --> 11:22.192
You're welcome.

11:30.129 --> 11:32.097
Mr. Bloom.

11:32.098 --> 11:33.630
Don't do that.

11:33.631 --> 11:35.410
Do what?

11:35.413 --> 11:37.630
Show him that we're not a united front.

11:37.631 --> 11:39.782
Give him any hope
whatsoever that we will cave.

11:39.785 --> 11:40.763
I didn't do that.

11:40.764 --> 11:42.363
- That is bullshit.
- I didn't do that.

11:42.364 --> 11:43.363
Yes, you did.

11:44.937 --> 11:46.767
You're insulting my
intelligence right now...

11:46.770 --> 11:47.930
Wait, wait.

11:47.931 --> 11:51.063
I want in-house counsel
and out-house counsel.

11:51.064 --> 11:53.576
Excuse me, outside counsel,

11:53.579 --> 11:54.978
to work together.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.587
So let's discuss what
we'll say before we say it.

11:57.590 --> 11:59.363
Agreed.

11:59.364 --> 12:02.824
Uh, uh, Diane. Marissa, come.

12:09.397 --> 12:12.329
Diane.

12:12.330 --> 12:14.663
I don't trust their in-house counsel.

12:14.664 --> 12:17.212
Well, he gets paid
if there are no suits.

12:17.215 --> 12:18.821
We get paid if we win suits.

12:18.824 --> 12:19.926
Makes him cowardly.

12:19.929 --> 12:21.241
Well, what do you want from us?

12:21.244 --> 12:22.326
We only have a few more hours,

12:22.328 --> 12:24.301
so I need you to look
into the two accusers.

12:24.304 --> 12:26.041
Marissa, you take the anonymous accuser.

12:26.044 --> 12:27.110
Jay, you take the other.

12:27.113 --> 12:28.791
They're not gonna be
happy about being woken up.

12:28.793 --> 12:30.657
My guess is that these stories stand up,

12:30.660 --> 12:32.923
but Preston makes a good
point about the alt-right.

12:32.926 --> 12:35.429
Find out if this is a setup.

12:35.430 --> 12:37.658
Don't believe the women? It's not that.

12:37.661 --> 12:40.694
We're in the second wave of
these harassment charges, Diane.

12:40.695 --> 12:43.760
Certain people are using
it for political advantage.

12:43.761 --> 12:45.259
Let's just be sure

12:45.262 --> 12:48.860
our charges stand up. All right?

12:48.861 --> 12:51.794
- Okay, we're on it.
- Good.

12:51.795 --> 12:55.061
Should I call Lucca?

12:55.062 --> 12:57.902
No. She and Maia are
on consent decree duty.

12:57.905 --> 12:59.195
Oh, oh, right.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.626
Hey, did you see another
lawyer got killed?

13:03.629 --> 13:06.407
- What? Who?
- Wilk Hobson.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.376
Oh.

13:08.379 --> 13:10.199
- You know him?
- Yes.

13:10.202 --> 13:12.375
He and my late partner, Will Gardner,

13:12.378 --> 13:14.694
once got in a fistfight. My God.

13:14.695 --> 13:16.194
What happened?

13:16.195 --> 13:18.863
He was found hanged
in his vacation home.

13:18.866 --> 13:21.231
He was found hanged? So...

13:21.234 --> 13:22.727
Wait, was he killed, or...

13:22.728 --> 13:24.094
Police don't know.

13:24.095 --> 13:26.261
He had sued somebody
on a slip-and-fall,

13:26.262 --> 13:28.527
and the other client had threatened him.

13:28.528 --> 13:31.161
Wow.

13:31.162 --> 13:34.940
The year of living dangerously.

13:47.860 --> 13:50.259
How long do these
pursuits usually go on for?

13:50.262 --> 13:51.794
We can let you out.

13:51.795 --> 13:54.418
No, no, I... I was just wondering.

14:04.494 --> 14:05.926
Put your fucking hands up!

14:05.929 --> 14:07.681
Don't move, motherfucker, don't move!

14:07.684 --> 14:08.794
Stay here.

14:08.795 --> 14:10.794
Don't move, motherfucker, do not move!

14:10.795 --> 14:14.080
Yeah, put your hands
where I can see them.

14:14.083 --> 14:15.616
Do not move your hands!

15:59.501 --> 16:01.134
Hey!

16:02.922 --> 16:04.521
Stay here.

16:04.524 --> 16:05.852
Put your hands...

16:05.855 --> 16:07.523
Put your hands where I can see them.

16:07.526 --> 16:09.546
Don't shoot, don't shoot!

16:09.549 --> 16:11.031
Hands where I can fucking see them!

16:11.034 --> 16:12.365
Get back in the car, ma'am.

16:12.368 --> 16:13.656
Don't move, motherfucker!

16:13.659 --> 16:14.850
- Stay down, motherfucker!
- Hey, hey.

16:14.852 --> 16:16.973
Take it easy, Bobby.
We've got eyes on us.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.375
Get down, get down.

16:18.376 --> 16:19.342
- What the fuck?
- Shit.

16:19.343 --> 16:21.242
- Say his name!
- Where'd that come from?

16:21.243 --> 16:22.741
Philando Castile!

16:22.742 --> 16:25.309
Say his name!

16:25.310 --> 16:27.142
Philando Castile!

16:27.143 --> 16:28.405
Say his name!

16:28.408 --> 16:30.824
- You see where it came from?
- Yeah, north corner. Eighth floor.

16:30.826 --> 16:32.648
- I'm going in.
- Yo, Officer, say his name!

16:32.650 --> 16:34.179
Why you still got your gun out?

16:34.182 --> 16:34.866
Who said that?

16:34.869 --> 16:36.872
- They always got their gun out.
- What's it matter to you?

16:36.874 --> 16:37.997
'Cause I say it matters.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.386
- Whatever.
- You see who threw that bottle?

16:40.389 --> 16:41.303
Huh?

16:41.306 --> 16:43.253
- Any of you.
- Not us, Officers.

16:43.255 --> 16:45.409
Yeah, I know your name. Raymond, right?

16:45.410 --> 16:47.692
- When'd you get out, Raymond?
- January 19.

16:47.695 --> 16:50.028
- And who's your parole officer?
- You should be back in the car.

16:50.030 --> 16:52.030
- No, I'm all right, thank you.
- No, don't look at her.

16:52.032 --> 16:54.732
Look at me. When's the last
time you saw your parole officer?

16:54.735 --> 16:57.443
- Tuesday before last.
- You smoking marijuana, Raymond?

16:57.445 --> 16:58.575
Your name Maia?

16:58.578 --> 17:00.849
Yeah. Chantal, right?

17:00.852 --> 17:02.591
Yeah. You're bleeding.

17:02.594 --> 17:03.660
Oh, it's fine.

17:03.663 --> 17:04.648
It's flying glass.

17:04.652 --> 17:07.185
- You two know each other?
- What you doing around here?

17:07.188 --> 17:09.036
I'm just here to observe.

17:09.039 --> 17:11.638
Make sure the officers are
doing things by the book.

17:11.642 --> 17:12.935
She a client?

17:12.938 --> 17:14.865
No, actually, we were
locked up together.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.067
What?

17:17.069 --> 17:20.203
_

17:27.108 --> 17:29.013
What's this?

17:29.016 --> 17:30.341
Looks like a DUI.

17:30.344 --> 17:31.713
You're in luck.

17:31.716 --> 17:33.276
Action tonight.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.409
Oh!

17:51.410 --> 17:53.067
You scared me. Hello.

17:53.070 --> 17:55.307
Evening. License and
registration, please.

17:55.310 --> 17:57.505
Of course.

17:57.508 --> 17:59.640
Have you had anything
to drink this evening?

17:59.643 --> 18:02.876
Well, it was a celebration,
so I had to have something.

18:02.879 --> 18:05.583
I see, and how much have you
had to drink tonight, ma'am?

18:05.586 --> 18:07.478
Just one mai tai, that's all.

18:07.481 --> 18:09.875
And mostly, it was pineapple juice.

18:09.876 --> 18:14.309
You know, I know the officer
that usually works here.

18:14.310 --> 18:16.415
You know, the one that
looks like Jim Nabors?

18:16.418 --> 18:17.517
Oh, wasn't that sad

18:17.520 --> 18:19.356
about him dying?

18:21.809 --> 18:23.142
Lucca?

18:23.143 --> 18:25.567
Oh, my God.

18:25.570 --> 18:26.969
Mrs. Lovatelli?

18:26.972 --> 18:28.804
Oh, please. Francesca.

18:28.807 --> 18:30.677
I was almost your mother-in-law,

18:30.680 --> 18:31.661
for Christ's sake.

18:31.664 --> 18:33.307
What are you doing here?

18:33.310 --> 18:35.224
Are you in trouble?

18:35.227 --> 18:37.940
Oh, no. No, I-I'm doing a
ride-along with the police

18:37.943 --> 18:39.641
on a consent decree.

18:39.642 --> 18:41.424
I'm sorry, I just tuned out.

18:41.427 --> 18:42.342
Ma'am.

18:42.343 --> 18:44.067
I need to see your driver's license

18:44.070 --> 18:45.835
- and registration, please.
- "Ma'am."

18:45.838 --> 18:47.450
Do I look like a "ma'am" to you?

18:47.453 --> 18:50.169
I'll have you know I do Pilates, daily.

18:50.172 --> 18:52.450
Please follow instructions.
Step out of the car.

18:52.453 --> 18:54.380
Oh! Here's a tough one.

18:55.888 --> 18:59.060
Well, is he the "bad cop"?

18:59.063 --> 19:02.872
Now, look, I have a card here
that Jim Nabors gave to me,

19:02.875 --> 19:06.096
because I'm a good
citizen, and I also give

19:06.099 --> 19:08.353
to the police department fund.

19:08.356 --> 19:10.342
Ma'am, that doesn't matter.

19:10.343 --> 19:12.177
We treat each citizen equally.

19:12.180 --> 19:13.945
Well, that's what they
say at Saks before you

19:13.948 --> 19:15.763
show them the gold card.

19:15.766 --> 19:17.864
Where is Lucca?

19:17.867 --> 19:20.498
There you are. Why did you
and Colin break up, anyway?

19:20.501 --> 19:22.307
Okay, ma'am, I need
you to pay attention.

19:22.310 --> 19:24.242
Please, step over here, out of traffic.

19:24.243 --> 19:26.856
- I can do that.
- Now, I need you to take nine steps.

19:26.859 --> 19:28.986
- All right.
- Heel to toe in a straight line.

19:28.989 --> 19:31.458
You know, it's not because
you're black, Lucca.

19:31.461 --> 19:34.006
I liked you. So many of his girlfriends

19:34.009 --> 19:36.520
have big tits, and they
have nothing to say.

19:36.523 --> 19:39.713
Ma'am, ma'am. You're clearly inebriated.

19:39.716 --> 19:43.142
We'll need you to place
your hands behind your back.

19:43.143 --> 19:45.599
Oh, come on, I've had one mai tai.

19:45.602 --> 19:47.478
Francesca, I don't
think it's a-a good idea

19:47.481 --> 19:49.880
to say anything more,
for the moment, legally.

19:49.883 --> 19:52.240
- You are so adorable.
- Okay.

19:52.243 --> 19:54.209
Okay, hands on the
vehicle, please, ma'am.

19:54.210 --> 19:55.375
Which one?

19:55.376 --> 19:56.530
This one, right over here.

19:56.532 --> 19:57.599
This is ridiculous.

19:57.601 --> 19:59.927
I've had one mai tai.

19:59.930 --> 20:01.526
Might I have a mai tai?

20:01.529 --> 20:03.236
I know what a mai tai is, ma'am.

20:03.239 --> 20:05.733
- Please, hands on the car.
- I bet you do.

20:10.452 --> 20:12.785
What are you doing?

20:12.788 --> 20:15.386
Sorry, it's just a-a
ringtone I have to get.

20:15.389 --> 20:16.722
- Hey.
- Yeah, Colin?

20:16.725 --> 20:18.407
I'm sorry for calling so late.

20:18.410 --> 20:20.338
It's all good. W-What's up?

20:20.341 --> 20:21.741
Uh, actually, I'm on

20:21.742 --> 20:24.971
a consent decree ride-along with
some cops in Lake View, and...

20:24.974 --> 20:26.375
Who is that?

20:26.376 --> 20:28.209
- Your mother is being arrested.
- Can't she call you back?

20:28.210 --> 20:30.653
Uh... sorry, what was that?

20:30.656 --> 20:32.942
Your mother is being arrested.

20:32.943 --> 20:34.908
She... she what?

20:34.909 --> 20:36.842
Your mother? Francesca?

20:36.843 --> 20:39.375
She's being taken in for a DUI.

20:39.376 --> 20:40.708
How...

20:40.709 --> 20:42.330
W-Wait. Uh, uh...

20:42.333 --> 20:44.142
W-What are you doing there?

20:44.143 --> 20:45.700
- H-Hold on, stop.
- I am holding on.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.340
You know who should drive?

20:47.343 --> 20:48.924
- You're a little busy.
- Not me.

20:48.927 --> 20:50.641
Let me, uh, call you back

20:50.642 --> 20:52.675
when I find out what
station's she been taken to.

20:52.676 --> 20:54.708
No, no, no. I'm not. It... hey...

20:57.076 --> 20:59.247
So, are you done with your business?

20:59.250 --> 21:02.545
Like everyone else, I didn't
want to believe it at first.

21:02.548 --> 21:04.395
I mean, who'd want to? It's Kip Dunning.

21:04.398 --> 21:06.058
He was supposed to be
one of the good ones.

21:06.060 --> 21:07.226
He is one of the good ones.

21:07.229 --> 21:08.460
Mr. Preston, please.

21:08.463 --> 21:10.142
Let Ms. Nivola continue.

21:10.143 --> 21:13.036
Thank you. You can call me Naomi.

21:15.693 --> 21:17.359
Look, I stand by my sources.

21:17.362 --> 21:19.361
I don't know what else to say.

21:19.364 --> 21:21.926
- And how long you been working on this story?
- Two months.

21:21.929 --> 21:23.756
And how'd you approach these two women?

21:23.759 --> 21:26.207
I didn't. I saw their stories on #MeToo.

21:26.210 --> 21:29.075
I wrote them, and asked if they
would be willing to comment.

21:29.076 --> 21:31.046
They were hesitant, but
they agreed to have lunch.

21:31.049 --> 21:33.200
So you were trolling #MeToo for stories.

21:33.203 --> 21:35.042
- Mr. Preston, come on.
- It's a fair question.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.741
- Let her answer.
- No.

21:36.742 --> 21:38.780
I was writing my own account on #MeToo,

21:38.783 --> 21:40.257
and that's how I saw their stories.

21:40.260 --> 21:43.068
Your own account? So
you're pursuing this story

21:43.071 --> 21:44.293
as a vendetta?

21:45.809 --> 21:47.275
You know, I-I don't find

21:47.276 --> 21:48.708
this funny, ma'am, do you?

21:48.709 --> 21:50.718
- Hmm.
- The destruction of a man's life?

21:50.721 --> 21:53.307
No, I don't find that funny,
I find your question funny.

21:53.310 --> 21:56.014
Uh-huh. Sure, I've
been sexually harassed

21:56.017 --> 21:59.411
at work, as have 80% of women.

21:59.414 --> 22:01.879
I wrote a story about
taking a glass of water

22:01.882 --> 22:05.075
and pouring it down the
front of my harasser's pants.

22:05.076 --> 22:09.242
So I don't think my
story has any connection

22:09.243 --> 22:13.536
to the rapes and sexual
assaults mentioned in my piece.

22:13.539 --> 22:18.004
Is there any chance that the two
victims have a political bias?

22:18.007 --> 22:19.042
You mean, are they

22:19.043 --> 22:20.741
- O'Keefe plants?
- Yes.

22:20.742 --> 22:23.275
I checked their backgrounds,
and they held up.

22:23.276 --> 22:27.075
And not that it matters, but
both women did not vote in 2016.

22:27.076 --> 22:28.472
And one was a Bernie supporter.

22:28.475 --> 22:30.546
Who might be angry at
Kip's support for Hillary.

22:30.549 --> 22:33.049
Mm, sure.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.775
But why don't you ask them?

22:34.776 --> 22:36.647
Why don't you check my sources?

22:36.650 --> 22:38.375
Uh, we are.

22:38.376 --> 22:40.093
Good.

22:45.109 --> 22:46.375
Are you Jay?

22:46.376 --> 22:47.875
Yes. Beth Lygard?

22:47.876 --> 22:49.176
Yeah. Hang on.

22:51.041 --> 22:53.340
I'm e-mailing this photo
to a friend of mine.

22:53.343 --> 22:54.541
Just so you know, if you try anything,

22:54.543 --> 22:55.667
there's a record you were here.

22:55.669 --> 22:57.725
I'm still happy to go to a coffee shop.

22:57.728 --> 22:59.042
I mean, there are all-night
diners we can go to.

22:59.043 --> 23:00.375
Oh, I don't like crowds.

23:00.376 --> 23:01.708
E-mailing now.

23:01.709 --> 23:03.775
How do you spell "Dipersia"?

23:03.776 --> 23:05.075
Uh...

23:12.257 --> 23:14.209
Do you want me to get that?

23:14.210 --> 23:15.741
No, I like the sound.

23:17.276 --> 23:18.675
He doesn't.

23:22.290 --> 23:24.035
Didn't you get what you need from Naomi?

23:24.038 --> 23:26.191
I-I told Naomi the whole story.

23:26.194 --> 23:28.496
I'm just checking to make
sure she got it right.

23:28.499 --> 23:30.142
I don't like to talk about it.

23:30.143 --> 23:31.875
No offense.

23:31.876 --> 23:33.675
I've had some issues since,

23:33.676 --> 23:36.006
you know, nothing major.

23:36.009 --> 23:37.242
Paranoia.

23:37.245 --> 23:39.129
Now I keep the TV on all night.

23:39.132 --> 23:41.108
The light is comforting.

23:41.109 --> 23:43.007
- Celebrity news?
- Always.

23:43.010 --> 23:45.609
I like when they expose the big stars.

23:45.612 --> 23:47.407
I started out working for TMZ.

23:47.410 --> 23:49.808
You're kidding.

23:49.809 --> 23:51.409
No. I did the scoop

23:51.410 --> 23:53.243
on Lawrence Mitchell and the babysitter.

23:54.710 --> 23:56.875
Seriously?

23:56.876 --> 23:58.818
Well, you can do a story on-on how

23:58.821 --> 24:00.386
they're trying to shut me up.

24:00.389 --> 24:02.209
Kip Dunning has
investigators everywhere.

24:02.210 --> 24:04.238
They're like Black Cube, you know?

24:04.241 --> 24:05.609
Jews.

24:06.642 --> 24:07.928
Hmm.

24:12.780 --> 24:15.733
Thank you.

24:15.742 --> 24:17.433
So, what'd we do wrong?

24:17.436 --> 24:18.850
Excuse me?

24:18.853 --> 24:20.242
Well, you had your
iPhone out, and you were

24:20.243 --> 24:21.675
writing us up. What was it?

24:21.676 --> 24:23.340
Oh, I was just wondering what the basis

24:23.343 --> 24:25.309
for questioning Raymond was.

24:25.310 --> 24:27.095
We were investigating an incident.

24:27.098 --> 24:29.097
The bottles being thrown?

24:29.100 --> 24:31.775
Yeah.

24:31.776 --> 24:34.708
Yeah, see, the bottles
were thrown from above.

24:34.709 --> 24:37.708
We were looking for witnesses.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.764
Part of what we do is make

24:39.767 --> 24:41.707
our presence known, and
if you lived in this area,

24:41.709 --> 24:43.105
that's what you'd want us to do.

24:43.108 --> 24:44.741
Okay.

24:44.742 --> 24:46.342
Thanks.

24:46.343 --> 24:47.528
Okay.

24:47.531 --> 24:50.430
Everything by the book, right?

24:50.433 --> 24:52.660
Come on, Vince, let's go.

24:52.663 --> 24:54.008
Put your hands behind your back.

24:54.009 --> 24:55.741
- What? What'd I do?
- Turn around, put your hands on the fence.

24:55.742 --> 24:57.116
- Hey.
- Spread your legs.

24:57.119 --> 24:58.308
- This is bullshit.
- Spread your legs.

24:58.310 --> 24:59.551
You got a problem, miss?

24:59.554 --> 25:01.019
You back the fuck up.

25:01.022 --> 25:02.409
Now,

25:02.410 --> 25:03.942
you want it by the book?

25:03.943 --> 25:05.342
He said that he hadn't talked

25:05.343 --> 25:07.379
to his parole officer
in more than a week.

25:07.382 --> 25:09.962
Sir, I told my parole officer
I wasn't able to see him.

25:09.965 --> 25:11.879
- Please, sir.
- Tell it to the lawyer, right?

25:11.882 --> 25:14.238
Because we were gonna let
you go, but she-she says

25:14.241 --> 25:17.473
there's got to be a legal basis
for every fucking thing we do.

25:17.476 --> 25:18.875
Language, Officer.

25:18.878 --> 25:21.165
Hey, Vince, we got a 10-54 nearby.

25:21.168 --> 25:22.494
You want to kick him?

25:22.497 --> 25:24.342
No. Request a prisoner transport.

25:24.345 --> 25:27.176
I think our ride-along
might enjoy a 10-54.

25:33.736 --> 25:36.167
I can't tell if it's anti-Semitism

25:36.179 --> 25:37.480
- or if there's something...
- Or what?

25:37.482 --> 25:39.347
Justified hatred of Jews?

25:39.350 --> 25:40.970
No.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.675
She brought up Black Cube,

25:42.676 --> 25:44.689
the same investigators
hired by Weinstein.

25:44.692 --> 25:46.556
Right. Ex-Mossad.

25:46.559 --> 25:48.650
I don't know. Maybe this is venturing

25:48.653 --> 25:50.843
over into political hit territory.

25:50.846 --> 25:52.837
Let's ask her.

25:52.840 --> 25:56.369
What, did she take the
victim's paranoia into account?

25:56.372 --> 25:58.215
Yeah, actually.

26:04.540 --> 26:05.972
What do you think?

26:05.973 --> 26:08.439
About the victim?

26:08.440 --> 26:10.839
Boseman.

26:12.906 --> 26:15.407
Is he losing perspective?

26:17.440 --> 26:19.440
Ah, sit.

26:21.613 --> 26:22.978
Like some pizza?

26:22.981 --> 26:25.106
No, thank you.

26:25.107 --> 26:29.306
So, you're worried that
Beth is a bit high-strung?

26:29.307 --> 26:34.083
Yeah, she was going on
about being pursued by Jews.

26:34.086 --> 26:38.872
Mm-hmm. She-she was
worried about Black Cube.

26:38.873 --> 26:40.872
Is she anti-Semitic?

26:40.873 --> 26:44.439
My guess, she probably is.

26:44.440 --> 26:46.400
You don't think that matters?

26:46.403 --> 26:50.106
I think that anti-Semites
can be harassed, too.

26:50.109 --> 26:51.438
Then, maybe that should be included

26:51.440 --> 26:53.240
in your news story, also.

26:54.934 --> 26:56.507
Maybe it should.

27:00.187 --> 27:02.376
All right, I guess I've seen you on TV.

27:02.379 --> 27:03.573
Mm-hmm.

27:03.574 --> 27:05.809
I feel like I know you.

27:05.812 --> 27:08.206
Mm-hmm. Probably.

27:08.207 --> 27:11.626
- This is not the right time for this.
- What?

27:11.629 --> 27:14.020
1:00 in the morning over cold pizza?

27:14.023 --> 27:16.189
Yeah.

27:16.192 --> 27:18.506
Maybe we could...

27:18.507 --> 27:21.073
go for coffee sometime?

27:23.932 --> 27:25.931
You don't recognize me.

27:25.934 --> 27:29.039
- That's the thing, I-I think I do.
- No.

27:29.040 --> 27:31.139
No. Uh...

27:31.140 --> 27:34.410
you were a guest lecturer
in criminal defense

27:34.413 --> 27:36.546
at University of Chicago.

27:38.075 --> 27:39.872
I was your student.

27:39.873 --> 27:42.406
- Ah, my God.
- Hmm.

27:42.407 --> 27:44.962
What class?

27:44.965 --> 27:47.311
- Criminal Evidence.
- Oh, wow.

27:48.450 --> 27:50.106
Naomi, Naomi, Naomi...

27:50.107 --> 27:51.939
I sat in the front.

27:51.940 --> 27:53.339
My hair was different.

27:53.340 --> 27:56.039
But you never became a lawyer?

27:56.040 --> 27:57.406
No.

27:57.407 --> 27:59.239
Why not?

27:59.240 --> 28:01.072
Because of you.

28:01.073 --> 28:02.678
- 'Cause of...
- Yes.

28:02.681 --> 28:04.814
I wasn't pretty enough for you.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.439
Excuse me?

28:06.440 --> 28:09.307
I was in the same class as Liz Reddick.

28:11.253 --> 28:13.509
You only had time for her.

28:15.374 --> 28:16.673
So...

28:16.676 --> 28:19.140
I think I'll skip the coffee.

28:35.685 --> 28:38.250
I don't usually drink.

28:38.253 --> 28:39.908
I don't like drunks.

28:39.911 --> 28:41.719
My grandfather was a drunk.

28:41.720 --> 28:44.586
I think it's in the genes. Alcoholism.

28:44.587 --> 28:46.586
Well, Colin doesn't drink.

28:46.587 --> 28:48.586
I mean... not a lot.

28:48.587 --> 28:51.486
Yeah, well, I think
it skips a generation.

28:51.487 --> 28:54.452
So when Colin has kids, watch out.

28:54.453 --> 28:56.686
Do you have any other...

28:56.687 --> 28:58.700
issues in your family?

28:58.703 --> 29:01.452
How much time do you have?

29:03.253 --> 29:04.553
Aw,

29:04.554 --> 29:07.345
you're such a good, adorable girl.

29:07.348 --> 29:09.825
Oh, I wish I had your skin.

29:09.828 --> 29:11.352
And your hair.

29:11.353 --> 29:13.736
I can't believe I'm being arrested.

29:13.739 --> 29:15.504
I wasn't even drinking

29:15.507 --> 29:17.206
that much.

29:23.255 --> 29:25.717
_

29:25.720 --> 29:28.489
You called about the
bachelor, no one in or out?

29:28.492 --> 29:30.372
_

29:30.880 --> 29:33.465
_

29:50.247 --> 29:51.730
I'll take the bedroom.

29:51.733 --> 29:53.165
All right.

29:55.729 --> 29:58.095
Got lights in the bedroom.

29:58.098 --> 29:59.728
There anything in there?

29:59.731 --> 30:01.619
Not yet.

30:13.262 --> 30:14.953
Huh.

30:21.838 --> 30:23.717
Ugh.

30:25.945 --> 30:28.184
- Hey, think I found the problem.
- The body?

30:28.187 --> 30:30.877
No, no. It's food.

30:30.880 --> 30:33.620
Maybe there is no body.

30:50.637 --> 30:52.953
Hey! She found it!

30:56.075 --> 30:57.699
You all right?

30:59.453 --> 31:01.319
Come on.

31:01.320 --> 31:03.942
It's all right. You can go out

31:03.945 --> 31:05.465
into the hall.

31:08.849 --> 31:10.715
Better get the examiner.

31:12.587 --> 31:14.247
Ugh.

31:22.859 --> 31:24.459
Here.

31:25.784 --> 31:27.818
- Go on.
- Thank you.

31:37.669 --> 31:40.086
First time seeing a dead body?

31:42.946 --> 31:44.845
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

31:44.848 --> 31:47.220
It's all right to step outside.

31:48.353 --> 31:49.753
No, I'm okay.

31:51.554 --> 31:53.801
Hey, Vince?

31:53.804 --> 31:55.387
You got a minute?

32:26.371 --> 32:28.537
Yeesh, guy had terrible taste in...

32:28.540 --> 32:29.939
Oh, God, no.

32:29.942 --> 32:32.319
No, that's...

32:34.184 --> 32:36.978
Look, this is becoming
a bit of a hassle.

32:36.981 --> 32:38.111
I'm sorry.

32:38.114 --> 32:39.673
I know this is difficult.

32:39.676 --> 32:41.419
Do you? Really?

32:41.420 --> 32:42.519
How?

32:42.520 --> 32:43.985
I don't know

32:43.986 --> 32:46.252
from personal experience, but...

32:46.253 --> 32:48.603
honestly, this story won't run

32:48.606 --> 32:50.369
without you dropping the anonymity.

32:50.372 --> 32:52.553
And if this story doesn't run,

32:52.554 --> 32:55.019
Kip Dunning will keep
victimizing other women.

32:55.020 --> 32:58.119
Were you in a sorority in college?

32:58.120 --> 33:00.653
- Me? God, no.
- I was.

33:00.654 --> 33:02.653
I'll let you in on a little secret.

33:02.654 --> 33:05.220
There is no sisterhood.

33:07.378 --> 33:09.845
Are you a Bernie supporter?

33:09.848 --> 33:11.634
Excuse me?

33:11.637 --> 33:15.019
Or Nancy Pelosi? Joe Biden?

33:15.020 --> 33:16.541
What are you talking about?

33:16.544 --> 33:18.512
That's what my bosses think.

33:18.515 --> 33:20.413
That that's why you're
not helping us anymore.

33:20.414 --> 33:22.014
Because you realized it would bring down

33:22.015 --> 33:23.714
a liberal supporter like Kip.

33:23.715 --> 33:26.533
That you're doing it
for political reasons.

33:26.536 --> 33:28.122
- That's crazy.
- I know.

33:28.125 --> 33:31.157
Except... here we are.

33:31.160 --> 33:35.526
You are protecting a liberal
icon with your anonymity.

33:44.381 --> 33:46.313
What is that, pictures?

33:46.316 --> 33:47.850
Better.

33:49.481 --> 33:51.380
You can use this.

33:51.381 --> 33:53.448
But I'm staying anonymous.

33:56.847 --> 33:58.313
Naomi.

33:58.316 --> 33:59.788
- Hmm?
- Can we talk about this?

33:59.791 --> 34:02.634
It's not a big deal. I'm
sorry I brought it up.

34:02.637 --> 34:05.313
Yeah, but I was just thinking back.

34:05.314 --> 34:07.480
I never played favorites.

34:07.481 --> 34:09.347
- I never...
- Oh, come on, Adrian.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.228
Come on, at least be honest.

34:11.231 --> 34:13.330
Who got the coveted internship?

34:13.333 --> 34:16.121
Who got the glowing
recommendation letters?

34:17.243 --> 34:19.020
Can we talk downstairs?

34:21.565 --> 34:24.978
I wasn't in charge of the
internship program, Naomi.

34:24.982 --> 34:27.880
No, but your words carried weight.

34:27.882 --> 34:29.583
Why are we doing this?

34:29.585 --> 34:31.647
Because I don't think
I did anything wrong.

34:31.648 --> 34:33.679
Liz Reddick was a good student.

34:33.681 --> 34:36.491
- Who you started dating two months later.
- After the class was over.

34:36.494 --> 34:38.126
And that had nothing to do

34:38.129 --> 34:41.012
- with where I directed my attention.
- Okay.

34:41.014 --> 34:43.313
You're faultless.

34:43.313 --> 34:45.580
I wasn't saying that.

34:45.581 --> 34:48.801
You spent the whole class
smothering Liz with attention.

34:48.804 --> 34:50.503
And I get it.

34:50.505 --> 34:52.072
You had a crush.

34:52.074 --> 34:54.679
But there were a lot
of women in that class

34:54.681 --> 34:56.047
who were smart...

34:56.047 --> 34:57.681
and capable.

35:00.958 --> 35:03.781
And they left the lesser.

35:11.948 --> 35:13.480
Naomi.

35:13.481 --> 35:14.847
It's Liz.

35:14.848 --> 35:16.680
- Liz Reddick.
- Yeah!

35:16.681 --> 35:18.791
- How are you?
- I'm good, good.

35:18.794 --> 35:19.947
I'm-I'm sorry I'm late.

35:19.948 --> 35:22.845
I-I just got the call for
this case. Hey, Adrian.

35:22.848 --> 35:24.947
You remember Naomi from college?

35:24.950 --> 35:27.509
Yeah. She looks really different.

35:28.681 --> 35:31.395
Really? I-I don't
think she's aged a day.

35:31.398 --> 35:33.183
Thank you. We were, uh,

35:33.186 --> 35:35.378
- just discussing Criminal Evidence.
- Oh.

35:35.381 --> 35:37.580
Yes. That was a good class.

35:37.583 --> 35:40.880
You... you decided
against becoming a lawyer?

35:41.813 --> 35:44.378
- Yeah.
- That's too bad.

35:44.381 --> 35:46.715
You would've made a great one.

35:47.848 --> 35:49.381
Thanks.

35:51.948 --> 35:53.413
Oh.

35:53.414 --> 35:55.614
Uh, you should see this, Liz.

35:55.615 --> 35:57.380
You're such a beautiful girl.

35:57.381 --> 35:59.400
Don't. Get your hands off me.

35:59.403 --> 36:02.369
Come on. We've got something
going on between us.

36:02.372 --> 36:04.767
I want you to leave now. Please.

36:04.770 --> 36:07.348
I don't think you do.
If you walk out that...

36:09.915 --> 36:11.714
First of all, we can't be sure

36:11.715 --> 36:13.387
of the validity of that recording.

36:13.390 --> 36:16.047
- What? Yes, we can.
- Oh, come on, Burl, that is Kip Dunning

36:16.048 --> 36:17.647
harassing a young woman.

36:17.648 --> 36:19.075
All I hear is a flirtation.

36:19.078 --> 36:20.614
- Oh, that's bullshit.
- No.

36:20.615 --> 36:21.705
You know what's bullshit?

36:21.708 --> 36:23.056
There's no consent here.

36:23.059 --> 36:24.745
Exactly. That's why it's assault.

36:24.748 --> 36:27.547
No. Mr. Bloom, you know what I'm saying.

36:27.548 --> 36:29.666
No two-party consent to
record the conversation.

36:29.669 --> 36:31.580
- Listen to your in-house counsel.
- The recording

36:31.581 --> 36:33.347
wasn't made to prosecute him.

36:33.348 --> 36:34.864
It's about exposing him.

36:34.867 --> 36:36.578
Then why is this witness
staying anonymous?

36:36.581 --> 36:38.580
No, she's not.

36:38.581 --> 36:41.212
That's not what Mrs.
Please-and-Thank-You said.

36:41.215 --> 36:42.281
Miss.

36:42.284 --> 36:45.476
- Miss Please-and-Thank-You.
- It's being used

36:45.479 --> 36:47.380
- to prove the fact.
- Not if she won't let you

36:47.381 --> 36:49.410
use it in a court of law.

36:49.413 --> 36:50.945
Mr. Bloom?

36:50.948 --> 36:53.447
I-I can't advise running a story

36:53.448 --> 36:56.644
based on an ambiguous recording
made under dubious circumstances.

37:04.515 --> 37:05.847
Do me a favor, you two...

37:05.848 --> 37:08.747
Find out about their in-house counsel.

37:08.748 --> 37:10.896
Why? What are we looking for?

37:10.899 --> 37:12.610
Why he's working against us.

37:15.982 --> 37:17.547
Hello?

37:17.548 --> 37:19.947
Okay, I think I know what your deal is.

37:19.948 --> 37:21.185
Tully?

37:21.188 --> 37:23.014
Yeah.

37:23.015 --> 37:25.821
What are you doing? It's 3:00 a.m.

37:25.824 --> 37:27.123
What do you need, Tully?

37:27.126 --> 37:29.310
Uh, we'll get to that in a second.

37:29.313 --> 37:32.647
But first... I had
this insight into you.

37:32.648 --> 37:34.818
- Me?
- Yes, yes... you think

37:34.821 --> 37:36.614
the institutions will work.

37:36.615 --> 37:39.413
You think they will save
us from the barbarians.

37:39.414 --> 37:40.514
But...

37:40.515 --> 37:43.302
they... they won't.

37:43.305 --> 37:46.459
The only way to beat back the barbarians

37:46.462 --> 37:49.842
is by fighting them in the
streets every single day.

37:49.845 --> 37:52.115
And that is what I'm doing.

37:52.118 --> 37:54.740
Okay. Good to know. I gotta go.

37:54.743 --> 37:57.347
- So, can you bail me out?
- What?

37:57.348 --> 37:59.171
Well, they're taking
us in. I'm the leader.

37:59.174 --> 38:01.006
And-and they-they won't let me go

38:01.009 --> 38:03.490
on an I-bond unless somebody
puts down the 200 bucks.

38:03.493 --> 38:05.209
No. Tully, I'm sorry.

38:05.210 --> 38:07.110
I'll call you and
tell you which station.

38:07.113 --> 38:08.907
No, Tully. I am not doing this.

38:08.910 --> 38:10.144
Bye. I'll call you.

38:32.346 --> 38:34.055
Wait, no, no, no. Let's do it again.

38:34.058 --> 38:35.656
I wasn't ready. Here we go.

38:35.659 --> 38:37.925
One, two, three.

38:37.928 --> 38:39.594
Okay, I'll take this.

38:39.597 --> 38:41.414
- No. Wait, wait, go back there.
- All right,

38:41.417 --> 38:43.449
but would you like to
take a Breathalyzer test?

38:43.452 --> 38:46.571
- You may refuse.
- Oh, I think I'll refuse.

38:46.574 --> 38:47.840
Oh.

38:47.843 --> 38:49.042
- Hello.
- Hello.

38:49.045 --> 38:50.577
- Ah.
- Left thumb, please.

38:50.580 --> 38:52.775
Okay. You know, this isn't my fault.

38:52.776 --> 38:55.396
I've been going through
a really rough time

38:55.399 --> 38:57.708
- in my marriage.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

38:57.709 --> 39:01.341
Yeah, and I have a long history
of depression in my family.

39:01.344 --> 39:04.091
All that stuff's genetic...
You know, it gets passed down.

39:04.094 --> 39:05.042
Mom.

39:05.043 --> 39:07.209
Colin, what are you doing here?

39:07.210 --> 39:09.675
Oh, this is so embarrassing.

39:09.676 --> 39:11.775
Uh, what are you talking
about? Lucca called me.

39:11.776 --> 39:14.942
Oh... oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

39:14.943 --> 39:16.775
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm glad she did.

39:16.776 --> 39:17.875
Hey, officers,

39:17.876 --> 39:19.908
uh, Colin Morrello, A.U.S.A.

39:19.909 --> 39:22.708
This is my... my mother.

39:22.709 --> 39:26.755
Uh, guys, is there any way
we could handle this privately

39:26.758 --> 39:29.724
- to everyone's satisfaction?
- Oh, thank you, thank you, sweetheart.

39:29.727 --> 39:31.477
You are such a good son.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.713
I don't think that's such a good idea.

39:33.716 --> 39:35.477
Uh, well, yeah.

39:35.480 --> 39:37.071
I'm not paying attention anymore.

39:37.074 --> 39:40.490
Look, this is her first
offense and no one was hurt.

39:40.493 --> 39:42.782
I'm not sure if she-she mentioned this,

39:42.785 --> 39:45.310
but, uh, she's going through a
bit of a tough time right now.

39:45.313 --> 39:47.309
- She mentioned it.
- Oh, she did? Okay.

39:47.310 --> 39:48.469
So we, uh, we...

39:48.472 --> 39:51.938
This may be a little bit
of a medication switch.

39:51.941 --> 39:53.985
So that might be having
a little bit of an effect,

39:53.988 --> 39:56.773
so I'm sure that we'll
be able to make sure

39:56.776 --> 39:58.342
that doesn't happen in the future.

40:03.943 --> 40:06.075
Are you serious?

40:06.076 --> 40:07.641
Absolutely.

40:07.642 --> 40:10.309
Naomi was quiet back then.

40:10.310 --> 40:12.352
Right?

40:12.355 --> 40:14.075
In school?

40:14.076 --> 40:16.775
No, no. She spoke up all the time.

40:16.776 --> 40:18.242
She was great.

40:18.243 --> 40:20.675
But not a great student.

40:20.676 --> 40:22.242
She made law review.

40:22.243 --> 40:24.975
Yeah, she sat in the back of
the lecture hall. I mean...

40:24.976 --> 40:26.828
It was seminar, Adrian.

40:26.831 --> 40:29.463
There was, what, 12 to 15 people?

40:29.466 --> 40:31.340
No, she sat up right in the front.

40:31.343 --> 40:33.042
She raised her hand every day.

40:33.043 --> 40:34.513
How do you not remember this?

40:34.516 --> 40:37.908
It was a lot of years ago, Liz.

40:37.911 --> 40:39.911
So? I remember her.

40:43.899 --> 40:45.843
She thinks I ignored her.

40:46.874 --> 40:49.310
That I was biased toward you.

40:49.313 --> 40:51.342
Well, you were.

40:51.343 --> 40:53.633
- Ah.
- Hey, you wanted into my pants.

40:53.636 --> 40:54.908
No, I didn't.

40:54.909 --> 40:57.055
Okay, yes,

40:57.058 --> 40:58.563
but it wasn't so obvious.

40:58.566 --> 41:00.806
Okay.

41:00.809 --> 41:03.875
Come on.

41:07.676 --> 41:10.042
She decided against becoming a lawyer.

41:10.043 --> 41:12.547
Because you didn't pay
enough attention to her?

41:12.550 --> 41:13.916
I know, right? Crazy.

41:13.919 --> 41:15.419
I mean, if she wanted
to become a lawyer,

41:15.421 --> 41:17.000
it wouldn't have mattered what I did.

41:17.003 --> 41:18.736
I guess. I...

41:20.243 --> 41:22.039
Teachers matter.

41:22.042 --> 41:23.607
She's making me feel like a shit.

41:23.610 --> 41:24.896
Well, you can be a shit.

41:24.899 --> 41:27.286
Thanks.

41:27.289 --> 41:29.622
Come here.

41:29.625 --> 41:30.908
What?

41:30.909 --> 41:32.180
Come here.

41:32.183 --> 41:34.307
Will you please just come over here?

41:34.310 --> 41:37.342
Dear God. Come here.

41:37.343 --> 41:40.157
Turn around.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.990
You must have leaned against something.

41:41.993 --> 41:43.555
It's been there for hours.

41:52.410 --> 41:54.243
Thanks.

42:06.086 --> 42:08.342
Thank you, by the way.

42:08.343 --> 42:10.075
Hey, it's the least I can do.

42:10.076 --> 42:12.842
Yeah. Family.

42:12.843 --> 42:14.776
They make you crazy.

42:18.219 --> 42:20.775
Hey, um...

42:20.776 --> 42:22.232
Hey, Officer.

42:22.235 --> 42:24.075
So, uh...

42:24.076 --> 42:25.242
are you charging her?

42:25.243 --> 42:26.641
Reckless driving.

42:26.642 --> 42:27.587
Okay.

42:27.590 --> 42:29.338
We didn't think a DUI was necessary

42:29.341 --> 42:31.706
under the circumstances,
and we got a wagon

42:31.709 --> 42:34.375
full of protesters to process, so...

42:34.376 --> 42:36.075
I don't suppose you got a problem

42:36.076 --> 42:37.342
with us exercising discretion

42:37.343 --> 42:39.055
- in this case?
- No.

42:39.058 --> 42:40.808
That's the thing about
those report cards.

42:40.811 --> 42:42.505
They don't allow for the human element.

42:42.508 --> 42:44.638
Don't have a rule for every case.

42:44.641 --> 42:47.180
Thank you, Officer.

42:47.183 --> 42:48.930
Thank you very much.

42:48.933 --> 42:50.175
All right.

42:50.176 --> 42:51.409
Mom, how we doing?

42:51.410 --> 42:53.203
Oh, just lovely, dear.

42:53.206 --> 42:54.872
People here couldn't have been nicer.

42:54.875 --> 42:57.704
- Five-star treatment all the way.
- Good.

42:57.707 --> 42:59.563
Oh, there he is. Jim Nabors.

42:59.566 --> 43:02.319
- Okay, Ma, let's get you home. Come on.
- Good night.

43:02.322 --> 43:04.906
- I'll drive.
- Colin.

43:04.909 --> 43:06.908
Yeah? Oh, uh, hold...

43:06.909 --> 43:08.309
I'll meet you outside, all right?

43:08.310 --> 43:11.675
- I'll be right there.
- Okay.

43:11.676 --> 43:13.413
Thanks again, by the way.

43:13.416 --> 43:15.749
- I owe you one.
- I'm pregnant.

43:18.430 --> 43:20.524
And it's your baby.

43:27.741 --> 43:30.240
What?

43:30.243 --> 43:33.078
I'm three months' pregnant.

43:33.081 --> 43:35.209
And I'm not asking for anything.

43:35.210 --> 43:38.828
I just think you should know.

43:40.800 --> 43:42.919
Three months? W-We...

43:42.922 --> 43:45.808
After the Rindell case.

43:45.811 --> 43:48.816
Rin... the one time?

43:48.819 --> 43:51.093
- Yes.
- Yeah.

43:51.096 --> 43:52.561
But you were, you said you were...

43:52.562 --> 43:54.561
No, we didn't and I said...

43:54.562 --> 43:56.506
Okay. Right. Um...

43:56.517 --> 44:00.916
A-Again, I just thought you should know.

44:00.919 --> 44:03.160
Wait. W-W-Wait, wait.

44:03.163 --> 44:04.878
Wait. Hold on. Wait. Just wait.

44:04.881 --> 44:09.162
Uh, okay, let's... uh, um...

44:09.163 --> 44:11.073
You should go to your mother.

44:11.076 --> 44:12.662
What? No.

44:12.663 --> 44:14.355
Colin, where are you?

44:14.358 --> 44:16.095
Okay, Ma, give me a minute.

44:16.096 --> 44:18.136
Oh, tell Lucca you'll
talk to her tomorrow.

44:18.139 --> 44:19.909
Ma. Just need a minute.

44:19.912 --> 44:21.623
Ugh.

44:21.626 --> 44:24.659
Okay, so...

44:24.660 --> 44:26.290
you're gonna have the baby?

44:26.293 --> 44:29.292
- Yes.
- Right.

44:29.295 --> 44:33.378
Okay. A-And d-do you know the sex?

44:33.381 --> 44:34.967
No.

44:34.970 --> 44:38.284
When-when will you know the sex?

44:38.287 --> 44:41.859
I don't know if I want to know.

44:41.860 --> 44:44.026
Uh, um, yeah.

44:44.027 --> 44:46.058
Are you all right?

44:46.061 --> 44:47.759
How are you feeling?

44:47.760 --> 44:51.508
I have some morning sickness
and some food issues,

44:51.511 --> 44:52.826
but other than that...

44:52.827 --> 44:54.725
Wait a minute, you were
just on a-a ride-along.

44:54.726 --> 44:56.214
You shouldn't be doing that.

44:56.217 --> 44:58.692
Okay.

44:58.693 --> 45:00.159
Good-bye, Colin.

45:00.160 --> 45:01.659
What? Hold on.

45:01.660 --> 45:03.582
Seriously. It's 4:00 in the morning.

45:03.585 --> 45:04.617
What are you doing?

45:04.620 --> 45:06.112
Lucca.

45:27.971 --> 45:29.733
You're right.

45:31.269 --> 45:35.827
I chose Liz for the internship
because she was a Reddick.

45:37.726 --> 45:41.826
That I remember.

45:41.827 --> 45:44.126
Adrian, please, it's okay.

45:44.127 --> 45:47.359
If you want to apologize,
you are forgiven.

45:47.360 --> 45:49.352
Naomi, I'm trying to explain

45:49.355 --> 45:51.726
it wasn't the bias that you thought.

45:54.542 --> 45:56.542
It was starfucking?

46:00.660 --> 46:02.660
Yeah.

46:04.125 --> 46:06.057
Good.

46:06.060 --> 46:07.992
There.

46:07.993 --> 46:11.359
Absolution.

46:11.360 --> 46:15.726
Not sexual bias. Starfucking.

46:18.409 --> 46:21.363
Adrian, would you please join us?

46:21.366 --> 46:23.132
Yeah.

46:25.294 --> 46:28.227
- Excuse me.
- Mm-hmm.

46:33.847 --> 46:36.092
Carter.

46:36.093 --> 46:38.079
What's One Night in Nashville?

46:38.082 --> 46:40.414
Excuse me?

46:40.417 --> 46:41.550
One Night in Nashville,

46:41.552 --> 46:43.291
a romantic comedy about a young lawyer

46:43.294 --> 46:44.938
who dreams of a recording contract.

46:44.941 --> 46:45.992
I don't understand this.

46:45.993 --> 46:47.259
That has nothing to do with this.

46:47.260 --> 46:48.326
Actually, it does.

46:48.327 --> 46:49.598
You sent it to Kip Dunning,

46:49.601 --> 46:51.611
telling him he would
be the perfect lead.

46:51.614 --> 46:53.061
- Oh.
- You didn't think it was worth

46:53.063 --> 46:54.483
telling your boss that
you'd asked Kip Dunning

46:54.485 --> 46:55.944
to play the lead?

46:55.947 --> 46:58.026
Carter?

46:58.027 --> 47:00.792
I've never spoken to Kip Dunning.

47:00.793 --> 47:02.159
Yes, just his manager.

47:02.160 --> 47:03.570
Okay, I'm not sure
what you're insinuating,

47:03.572 --> 47:04.859
but I can still do my job regardless...

47:04.860 --> 47:07.342
No, no. Uh, actually, you can't.

47:07.345 --> 47:08.926
Carter, let's step out.

47:08.927 --> 47:10.511
This shouldn't matter.

47:10.514 --> 47:11.882
His point still stands.

47:11.885 --> 47:13.619
This is defamation.

47:16.186 --> 47:18.155
I give this five minutes.

47:18.158 --> 47:19.525
Two tops.

47:24.319 --> 47:25.851
Mm-hmm.

47:25.852 --> 47:27.928
I win.

47:27.931 --> 47:30.413
It doesn't matter. It's a mistake

47:30.416 --> 47:32.048
to run this story.

47:32.051 --> 47:33.318
We're running it.

47:37.183 --> 47:39.382
And you wonder why people
are killing lawyers.

47:39.385 --> 47:40.593
Here.

47:40.596 --> 47:41.962
There you go.

47:44.385 --> 47:45.751
What's this?

47:45.752 --> 47:47.928
It's our lawsuit. See you in court.

47:55.352 --> 47:57.518
Yeah.

47:57.519 --> 47:59.460
We'll see him in court.

48:03.139 --> 48:06.350
_

48:09.297 --> 48:10.730
Well, you're pretty quiet.

48:10.733 --> 48:12.351
You all right?

48:12.352 --> 48:14.022
Fine.

48:14.025 --> 48:15.957
Put your clothes in the wash right away

48:15.960 --> 48:19.201
or the smell stays forever.

48:19.204 --> 48:20.538
Good luck.

48:47.319 --> 48:49.796
Officer Torino, do you have a second?

48:53.481 --> 48:55.480
Yeah?

48:55.483 --> 48:59.808
Uh, I don't want to
put this on my report,

48:59.811 --> 49:02.751
so if you just put the stuff you stole

49:02.752 --> 49:05.518
into evidence, I won't say anything.

49:05.519 --> 49:07.218
What are you talking about?

49:11.816 --> 49:13.316
Put the stuff into evidence

49:13.319 --> 49:15.218
and I will erase this.

49:22.497 --> 49:24.288
This is Tommy and this is Crystal.

49:24.291 --> 49:25.590
Who's Tommy?

49:25.593 --> 49:27.186
The dead man in the apartment.

49:27.189 --> 49:28.647
He's a retired cop.

49:28.650 --> 49:30.115
You knew him?

49:30.118 --> 49:32.117
No. He was in another district.

49:32.120 --> 49:34.113
So why did you take his things?

49:34.116 --> 49:37.549
This is Crystal.

49:37.552 --> 49:39.351
His wife's name is Patricia.

49:39.352 --> 49:40.694
They were separated,

49:40.697 --> 49:43.562
but that apartment was
where he met his girlfriend.

49:43.565 --> 49:45.231
Now, cops have a rule:

49:45.234 --> 49:48.022
don't let any guy's
wife find out anything

49:48.025 --> 49:49.824
you wouldn't want your
own wife finding out,

49:49.827 --> 49:51.215
so I took the picture

49:51.218 --> 49:52.928
of Tommy and his girlfriend

49:52.931 --> 49:55.983
'cause I didn't want it to be
Patricia's last memory of him.

49:55.986 --> 49:58.115
And I took the jewelry
that he was giving Crystal

49:58.118 --> 50:00.318
so that I could send it to his wife,

50:00.319 --> 50:03.118
saying it was his last
wish that she get it.

50:05.400 --> 50:08.599
Is there anything else, Maia?

50:08.602 --> 50:10.035
No.

50:10.038 --> 50:13.652
I hope you enjoyed the ride-along.

50:18.627 --> 50:22.004
Hi. There is a protester here

50:22.007 --> 50:24.318
who wasn't allowed to sign an I-bond

50:24.319 --> 50:27.217
- and he needs $200.
- Name?

50:27.218 --> 50:29.885
Tully.

50:29.886 --> 50:32.482
I actually don't know his last name.

50:32.485 --> 50:36.624
Um, can I just leave,
uh, bail for him and go?

50:36.627 --> 50:38.584
I-I guess he's the leader.

50:38.585 --> 50:40.761
Sure, I know him. Talks a lot?

50:40.764 --> 50:42.007
That's right.

50:42.010 --> 50:44.749
Uh, can I just, you know, leave it here?

50:44.752 --> 50:46.384
Want a receipt?

50:46.385 --> 50:47.885
No. That's okay.

50:59.077 --> 51:01.851
You all right, Captain Quinn?

51:01.852 --> 51:04.651
Just a bit of car
sickness, Officer Rindell.

51:04.652 --> 51:06.491
- Ouch.
- I know.

51:06.494 --> 51:08.020
Car sickness?

51:08.023 --> 51:09.988
Yours must've been intense.

51:09.991 --> 51:11.957
Yeah, it, it had moments.

51:11.960 --> 51:13.326
Yours?

51:13.329 --> 51:15.061
Same.

51:22.686 --> 51:24.251
You want to grab some breakfast?

51:24.252 --> 51:25.484
Uh, yeah.

51:25.485 --> 51:27.484
Yeah, that'd be really...

51:27.485 --> 51:30.552
You may have something
else to tend to first.

51:32.886 --> 51:34.171
See you tomorrow?

51:34.174 --> 51:36.468
Yeah. Go home and get some sleep.

51:51.884 --> 51:54.050
Did you make sure Francesca drank water?

51:54.053 --> 51:56.358
I did, I did.

51:56.361 --> 51:58.816
She, uh, will have dry mouth for a week.

51:58.819 --> 52:00.384
But...

52:00.385 --> 52:03.284
- listen, about what you said earlier...
- Colin.

52:03.285 --> 52:06.699
Seriously... I just supplied
you with information, that...

52:06.702 --> 52:07.751
Marry me.

52:15.752 --> 52:19.551
I'm walking away.

52:19.552 --> 52:22.284
This is your car.

52:22.285 --> 52:24.484
That's right.

52:24.485 --> 52:26.384
I'm driving away.

52:26.385 --> 52:28.818
It's not a dumb idea.

52:28.819 --> 52:32.284
Colin Morrello...

52:32.285 --> 52:34.386
no fucking way.

52:34.389 --> 52:36.284
- Why not?
- Three hours ago,

52:36.285 --> 52:37.663
you were fucking another woman.

52:37.666 --> 52:39.147
Yeah, well, I'm a tad more informed

52:39.150 --> 52:40.483
than I was three hours ago.

52:40.486 --> 52:42.685
- That doesn't change shit.
- It changes everything.

52:42.688 --> 52:45.527
Pregnancy is not a good
enough reason to get married.

52:45.530 --> 52:49.217
Yeah, well, it's a start.

52:51.852 --> 52:54.475
Seriously? Colin.

52:59.652 --> 53:01.397
No.
