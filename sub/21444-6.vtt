this is an observational exercise only.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.313
He's around, guys.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.550
We have knowledge now
that he has gun experience.

16:47.960 --> 16:49.393
He may be. What we do know

16:49.480 --> 16:51.277
is he's used a sawn-off automatic shotgun.

16:51.360 --> 16:55.273
Most probably a Remington 870
Express Magnum, cut down.

16:55.400 --> 16:56.435
So look out for that.

16:56.520 --> 16:59.193
He's also holding an 18-year-old female hostage.

16:59.720 --> 17:00.869

17:04.040 --> 17:05.598
No, if he feels like me,

17:05.680 --> 17:07.636
he's sleeping, which is the point.

46:29.360 --> 46:30.634
GIRL: Mary!

46:35.800 --> 46:37.358
Get in the plane!

46:50.160 --> 46:51.593
Good evening.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.238
Please sit down, be comfortable.

46:53.320 --> 46:55.629
I will be your host.

46:55.720 --> 46:57.392
My name is not important.

46:57.480 --> 47:00.597
And neither, of course, is yours.

47:00.680 --> 47:03.672
Every second, 4.3 babies arrive

47:03.680 --> 47:04.829
Every second, 4.3 babies arrive

47:04.920 --> 47:07.912
through a vagina onto this planet.

47:08.000 --> 47:11.515
Soon your babies will be arriving,

47:11.600 --> 47:14.592
but not through your vaginas.

47:14.680 --> 47:18.275
For too long the West has exploited the poor

47:18.360 --> 47:20.794
and impoverished women of Asia.

47:20.880 --> 47:23.792
Girls as young as 12 years old

47:23.880 --> 47:25.711
are sold as virgins

47:25.800 --> 47:27.836
-to gratify the appetite...
-l'm going to the airport.

47:27.920 --> 47:31.595
...of the wealthy.
But what sort of life is that, huh?

47:31.680 --> 47:34.911
Fucked to feed? Come on.

47:35.000 --> 47:38.709
And now you all want to grow your vile

47:38.800 --> 47:41.872
DNAs, your precious little babies

47:41.960 --> 47:45.111
inside the slave wombs

47:45.200 --> 47:47.430
of enslaved women,

47:47.520 --> 47:50.990
too poor to choose, but...

47:51.080 --> 47:54.072
Just one of these little bundles of happiness

47:54.080 --> 47:55.672
Just one of these little bundles of happiness

47:55.760 --> 47:57.955
will bring enough money

47:58.040 --> 48:00.349
to support a whole village

48:00.440 --> 48:04.274
in the Third World for years and years to come.

48:06.240 --> 48:10.153
Now the shoe is on the other foot.

48:11.240 --> 48:13.470
The tide has turned.

48:15.600 --> 48:18.319
Your babies have flown away

48:18.400 --> 48:21.312
and now it's your turn to cry.

48:26.840 --> 48:29.115
WOMAN: Is he saying they've left?

48:29.200 --> 48:32.158
Mate, stop this. This is theft.

48:32.240 --> 48:33.309
These are our babies.

48:33.400 --> 48:35.960
Dan, what's the legal
situation with the sergeant gone AWOL?

48:36.040 --> 48:37.268
-MAN: It's... It's our DNA.
-Yeah, yeah.

48:37.360 --> 48:41.069
You're the police.
Call the airport and detain them.

48:41.320 --> 48:44.278
This is kidnapping. They're our babies.

48:44.360 --> 48:46.112
No.

48:46.200 --> 48:48.873
No, actually, legally, the babies belong to them.

48:49.680 --> 48:52.717
(TEARFULLY) How, how is that possible?

48:54.040 --> 48:55.519
Their bodies, their wombs.

48:56.720 --> 48:58.312
What's inside them belongs to them.

48:59.360 --> 49:00.509
It's the law.

49:48.040 --> 49:49.393
Hey, it's me.

49:49.480 --> 49:50.469
Good news.

49:51.800 --> 49:53.279
l have Mary.

49:54.400 --> 49:55.753
(EXHALES)

49:56.280 --> 49:57.633
-Really?
-Yeah.

49:57.720 --> 50:00.188
Hey, um, we're just
driving back from the airport now.

50:00.280 --> 50:02.191
Why don 't you drop on by?

50:03.120 --> 50:04.235
May I?

50:04.320 --> 50:06.390
Yeah. (WHISPERS) Is that okay?

50:06.480 --> 50:07.959
She's very tired, Pyke.

50:09.960 --> 50:11.757
Yeah, yeah, we'll be there in 10 minutes, just...

50:11.840 --> 50:12.829
Come on by.

50:13.960 --> 50:16.997
Okay, thanks. Bye.

50:26.440 --> 50:27.429
(SIGHS)

51:11.960 --> 51:13.678
So you did come.

51:13.760 --> 51:15.034
She's asleep.

51:17.960 --> 51:19.393
She actuallyjust nodded off.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.149
Hey.

51:23.360 --> 51:24.349
Come in.

51:25.720 --> 51:27.756
You want a drink or something?

51:27.840 --> 51:29.478
-No, thanks.
-You sure?

51:29.560 --> 51:30.993
Water? Tea?

51:32.640 --> 51:34.392
I want to see Mary.

51:34.480 --> 51:36.914
-But if I'm disturbing her...
-No, no, no, come on.

51:37.000 --> 51:37.989
Come on, have a look in.

51:39.120 --> 51:40.997
Yeah, I'll, um, I'll take you through.

51:41.920 --> 51:43.194
Get her some water, Pyke.

52:00.680 --> 52:03.114
She gave me the biggest hug at the airport.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.555
She said, um,

52:05.640 --> 52:07.358
"You're my mum,

52:08.680 --> 52:10.910
"and I really need you."

52:15.320 --> 52:17.550
(WHISPERS) I think
it's unlocked something in me, you know.

52:19.080 --> 52:20.069
In us.

52:25.880 --> 52:27.233
Now I'm crying again.

52:45.560 --> 52:46.959
JULIA: Um,

52:47.040 --> 52:50.669
you, really stepped up
during our troubles and I want to thank you.

52:52.680 --> 52:54.477
Thank you.

52:54.560 --> 52:55.959
Really, thank you.

52:57.400 --> 52:59.152
You, uh, you helped us

52:59.240 --> 53:01.708
get some balance back again, into our family.

53:03.280 --> 53:04.269
(SIGHS)

53:06.560 --> 53:08.755
-Um...
-What?

53:09.760 --> 53:13.389
I've asked Pyke to give me two months.

53:15.360 --> 53:17.351
We've been through hell this last year

53:17.440 --> 53:19.271
and I think we owe it to ourselves.

53:22.920 --> 53:25.195
Oh, no. No, thanks.

53:26.040 --> 53:27.473
l have an appointment.

53:29.120 --> 53:33.113
There is one thing I wanted
to borrow. The birthday DVD of little Mary.

53:34.120 --> 53:35.439
-Yeah.
-Okay.

53:38.600 --> 53:41.353
Oh, that's our only copy, isn't it? (CHUCKLES)

53:43.800 --> 53:45.791
You know what, I'll...

53:45.880 --> 53:47.871
I'll pick it up as soon as she's finished.

53:48.920 --> 53:49.909
When are you watching it?

53:53.080 --> 53:54.069
Tonight.
