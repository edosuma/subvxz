HANK: All right, Bobby. Why don't you
read that Sunday-school report to me...

00:37.380 --> 00:40.781
like I'm a customer, and
you're trying to win my business?

00:40.917 --> 00:42.043
Okay.

00:42.652 --> 00:45.917
"The man I admire most
is my dad, Hank Hill.

00:46.256 --> 00:49.919
"He sells propane
and propane accessories."

00:50.159 --> 00:51.683
I like it already, son.

00:52.128 --> 00:55.495
You've grabbed my attention,
and got me eager for more.

00:55.632 --> 00:58.294
STRICKLAND: Howdy, Hank!
HANK: Mr. Strickland.

00:59.435 --> 01:01.562
STRICKLAND:
What ya got there, old chap?

01:01.671 --> 01:04.071
"The man I most admire, my daddy."

01:04.373 --> 01:06.399
Oh, you got that right, Bobby.

01:06.809 --> 01:11.439
15 years, I promoted him 15 times,
all the way to Assistant Manager.

01:12.148 --> 01:15.083
You should be proud, son. You're his seed.

01:16.486 --> 01:18.386
"I'm my daddy's seed."

01:18.555 --> 01:20.352
Hank, I gotta grunt.

01:20.623 --> 01:22.921
Let's take a little meeting in the back.

01:23.059 --> 01:26.859
Bobby, here's the key
to the March of Dimes gumball machine.

01:27.063 --> 01:28.655
All you can eat.

01:31.701 --> 01:34.534
Hank, you ever heard of
Holloway Hollows?

01:34.771 --> 01:37.171
Isn't that that new development
that promises:

01:37.240 --> 01:40.038
"Country-club living at Price Club prices"?

01:40.109 --> 01:43.875
STRICKLAND: Yeah, that's the one.
They're gonna need a propane supplier.

01:43.947 --> 01:47.849
Holloway himself has come down here
from Boston to check us out.

01:47.984 --> 01:50.043
This one is big, Hank.

01:50.453 --> 01:51.977
Here's your sales kit.

01:54.123 --> 01:57.286
- Rental-car keys?
- Big old Caddy!

01:57.794 --> 02:01.491
Yankees eat that stuff up
like a baby at his mama's malt shop.

02:03.266 --> 02:04.790
What the heck is this?

02:04.867 --> 02:08.860
That's one of them new counterfeit-proof
Benny Franklin hundred-dollar bills.

02:08.937 --> 02:11.634
Sir, this is Hank Hill you're talking to.

02:11.708 --> 02:15.337
I'm not gonna need all that
James Bond stuff to make the deal.

02:15.478 --> 02:18.811
Well, Hank, I don't want to sneeze
during your backswing.

02:18.881 --> 02:22.647
But we got some competition.
M.F. Thatherton.

02:24.153 --> 02:25.518
Thatherton?

02:30.126 --> 02:33.027
STRICKLAND: Sorry to call a meeting
in the skunk works, boys.

02:33.396 --> 02:35.762
Now, I promise not to make a habit of it.

02:36.532 --> 02:37.521
[Turns tap off]

02:39.969 --> 02:43.803
Boy, Thatherton, those are some
pretty tough sales quotas, I tell you what.

02:43.906 --> 02:45.339
You wanna meet the quota?

02:45.408 --> 02:48.707
Take some propane to an old-age home.
Tell them it's oxygen.

02:48.878 --> 02:50.709
You can't do that to old people.

02:51.648 --> 02:53.616
Aren't you the company man!

02:53.883 --> 02:57.478
You see, that's the difference between us.
You're a worker bee...

02:57.553 --> 02:59.783
- and I'm a queen.
- Say, huh?

02:59.856 --> 03:02.984
I'm going out on my own.
Thatherton Fuels.

03:03.526 --> 03:06.120
I already signed
Strickland's top three accounts.

03:06.195 --> 03:08.186
Well, you've got one heck of a nerve.

03:08.264 --> 03:11.062
Plotting against a man
while his seat's still warm!

03:11.134 --> 03:14.797
Take a good look around, Hank,
'cause you ain't going nowhere.

03:14.904 --> 03:16.462
That's where you're wrong.

03:17.674 --> 03:19.141
You can count on me, sir.

03:19.208 --> 03:22.041
I appreciate your vote of confidence,
and I just want to...

03:22.111 --> 03:24.477
STRICKLAND: Hank?
A little privacy, do you mind?

03:27.884 --> 03:30.910
[Rock 'n' roll music playing]

03:39.195 --> 03:41.220
BILL: Look at this! It's long!

03:42.231 --> 03:44.631
It's like... It's so... It's big.

03:45.668 --> 03:48.603
Look at the size of old Ben Franklin's head.

03:48.738 --> 03:50.638
He truly was the Homely Genius.

03:50.707 --> 03:54.040
Well, take a good look. 'Cause it's
going back to Strickland on Monday.

03:54.110 --> 03:56.635
PEGGY: Aren't you supposed to spend it
on your big client?

03:56.713 --> 04:00.012
When have I ever needed a three-figure
entertainment budget...

04:00.083 --> 04:01.414
to sell propane?

04:01.517 --> 04:04.543
I'm gonna close this deal
the same way I always do.

04:04.721 --> 04:08.213
A cup of coffee, a slice of pie
and a handshake.

04:08.624 --> 04:11.684
And if I hit a snag, pie à la mode.

04:13.596 --> 04:15.621
[Musical honk]

04:15.698 --> 04:19.827
HANK: Would you stop that? That horn
is for highway emergency use only!

04:19.902 --> 04:24.839
And you two, get off! I've gotta return
this pimpmobile in the same condition.

04:27.110 --> 04:29.271
Why you have silly cow car, Hank?

04:29.345 --> 04:33.577
Hank's entertaining a business prospect
from the East, Mr. Kahn.

04:33.716 --> 04:36.241
Oh, I see, Hank suck up to make sale.

04:36.319 --> 04:40.585
Kahn, I have never had to suck up
to make a sale, and I never will.

04:43.459 --> 04:45.654
What do you suppose
the Holloways look like?

04:45.728 --> 04:47.593
You know those Boston types.

04:47.663 --> 04:50.723
Probably small, pale,
and wearing penny loafers.

04:51.801 --> 04:55.066
- Put 'er there, partner!
- Mr. Holloway?

04:55.138 --> 04:57.868
Is a prom dress tight after a six-pack?

04:58.875 --> 05:00.900
Which way to your Cadillac?

05:00.977 --> 05:02.604
This one is in the bag.

05:05.181 --> 05:07.706
How'd you like to freshen up
with a nice hot towel?

05:08.785 --> 05:10.309
And here's one for you.

05:10.386 --> 05:13.116
Dang, these are Texas-size hot towels!

05:13.189 --> 05:15.089
You know, Peggy heated these towels...

05:15.158 --> 05:18.389
on our propane-powered Hotpoint range.

05:18.461 --> 05:20.520
Did a great job, I'll tell you what.

05:20.696 --> 05:22.493
"I'll tell you what."

05:22.565 --> 05:25.625
I like that. I'm gonna say it while I'm here.

05:26.102 --> 05:29.765
Well, I'd like to tell you what
Strickland can do...

05:29.839 --> 05:31.306
to meet your energy needs.

05:31.707 --> 05:35.108
You see, at Strickland,
the customer comes first.

05:35.178 --> 05:39.171
It's kinda interesting,
the word "customer" begins with "C.U."

05:39.549 --> 05:42.609
Well, we don't "see you"
as just another sale...

05:42.685 --> 05:44.812
but as a member of our team.

05:49.659 --> 05:51.593
[Whispering] Pie.

05:54.230 --> 05:56.562
HANK: Do you like pie?
BOBBY: I do!

05:59.402 --> 06:02.496
HANK: They got the best pie in town here,
Mr. Holloway.

06:02.572 --> 06:05.541
And it's cooked
with Strickland propane, too.

06:05.975 --> 06:09.035
Hey, look! There's a real
old Texas jukebox.

06:09.111 --> 06:11.136
Just like in The Last Picture Show!

06:11.380 --> 06:14.144
What'll you have, Hank? Salesman special?

06:14.283 --> 06:18.549
Yes, ma'am. Three slices of pecan pie
and two cups of coffee.

06:18.855 --> 06:22.291
- And three scoops of ice cream.
- Now, hold on, son.

06:22.592 --> 06:25.117
Let me let you in on a little salesman trick.

06:25.695 --> 06:28.391
Don't start off with ice cream right away.

06:28.497 --> 06:31.625
'Cause if you run into a hitch,
you got no place to go.

06:31.701 --> 06:34.727
HOLLOWAY: What kind of Texas jukebox
is that, for crying out loud?

06:34.804 --> 06:36.738
It doesn't even have the theme
from Dallas.

06:36.806 --> 06:39.468
HANK: Mr. Holloway,
I won't beat around the bush.

06:39.542 --> 06:43.069
There's 14 reasons
to go with Strickland Propane.

06:43.145 --> 06:44.669
[Holloway humming]

06:46.849 --> 06:50.046
14 very compelling reasons.

06:50.253 --> 06:54.314
[Singing] J.R., J.R., he's a really bad guy

06:54.523 --> 06:57.720
who lives on a ranch with his mom

06:58.194 --> 07:02.062
Say, I'm gonna call you "J.R."
From now on!

07:02.999 --> 07:04.762
Well, howdy, Hank.

07:05.434 --> 07:09.097
Ain't you gonna introduce me
to your golden-throated friend, here?

07:09.705 --> 07:12.503
Sure, I'll introduce you. Mr. Holloway...

07:12.675 --> 07:15.235
this is the only man ever censured...

07:15.311 --> 07:17.871
by the Texas Propane Association...

07:17.947 --> 07:21.644
for lewdness and conduct
unbecoming a propane salesman.

07:21.851 --> 07:24.615
M.F. Thatherton. Thatherton Fuels.

07:24.820 --> 07:27.084
Dang glad to meet you, M.F.

07:27.156 --> 07:29.420
- The M.F. Stands for...
- "My friend"!

07:29.558 --> 07:32.254
'Cause at Thatherton Fuels,
we're everybody's friend.

07:32.328 --> 07:35.422
And we want to be your friend, too,
Mr. Holloway.

07:35.498 --> 07:37.998
Who's this, Hank?
Your district sales manager?

07:38.131 --> 07:41.623
I'm his son, Bobby. I'm waiting for my pie.

07:41.935 --> 07:44.733
I can see you get your sense of humor
from your daddy.

07:44.805 --> 07:48.172
He gets his sense of humor from
both his parents, thank you very much.

07:48.375 --> 07:50.434
Pleasure meeting you, Holloway.

07:50.544 --> 07:54.480
I'll let old Hank
get on with his "14 reasons" speech.

07:55.382 --> 07:58.249
Bobby, you can tell
your Sunday-school class...

07:58.318 --> 08:02.015
that you met a real Texan today,
M.F. Thatherton.

08:05.325 --> 08:08.761
Jo Tiffany, you better make that
pie à la mode.

08:14.835 --> 08:17.326
HANK: Under your very feet,
Mr. Holloway...

08:17.404 --> 08:20.168
is what's called the propane crossroads.

08:20.407 --> 08:25.140
It's the only place in the world you can
straddle the East and West pipelines.

08:25.779 --> 08:29.215
You want Texas, Mr. Holloway?
This is Texas.

08:29.816 --> 08:32.477
HOLLOWAY: Where are the oil wells?
Where are the rattlers?

08:32.552 --> 08:34.746
J.R., I want to buy a six-shooter.

08:38.892 --> 08:42.885
PEGGY: Careful now, this Frito pie
is spicy, spicy, spicy.

08:43.730 --> 08:45.664
Oh. Oh.

08:45.765 --> 08:46.754
Mmm.

08:46.867 --> 08:49.028
That's yummy. Yes, it's wonderful.

08:49.102 --> 08:51.696
But, Peggy, you shouldn't make
such a fuss over me.

08:51.771 --> 08:54.137
I just want you to be yourself
while I'm here.

08:54.207 --> 08:56.641
That is the only gal I know how to be.

08:57.677 --> 09:00.009
I told you nicely to buy me a gun.

09:00.113 --> 09:02.980
Well, I know it's always fun
to take home a keepsake...

09:03.049 --> 09:05.279
but your time is so valuable.

09:05.919 --> 09:06.943
[Sighing]

09:07.020 --> 09:10.421
Look at all this nothing!
What's the suicide rate out here?

09:10.957 --> 09:12.447
Do you mean right here?

09:12.526 --> 09:15.654
'Cause this is where
Holloway Hollows is going up.

09:17.030 --> 09:18.019
Something's wrong.

09:18.098 --> 09:20.726
Yeah, it's the darn unions.
Come on, boys...

09:20.800 --> 09:23.291
finish up them Little Debbies
and get back to work.

09:23.370 --> 09:25.702
No, no. Something's wrong with you.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.898
HOLLOWAY: Where's your cowboy boots?
HANK: I don't have cowboy boots.

09:31.177 --> 09:35.705
You know, Mr. Holloway,
Texas has changed a lot since the 1850s.

09:35.916 --> 09:40.250
Jeez. I just wanted to see some boots
or spurs, or anything.

09:40.487 --> 09:42.717
I come all the way from Boston
to see Texas.

09:42.789 --> 09:45.280
And you don't have real boots,
or guns, or nothing.

09:47.160 --> 09:48.525
Thatherton!

09:49.195 --> 09:52.028
You know, Mr. Holloway,
I once had a pair of boots.

09:52.699 --> 09:53.688
And...

09:53.767 --> 09:57.863
And then, one day,
my Uncle Fess lost his in a tornado.

09:57.938 --> 10:00.372
HOLLOWAY: Oh, you mean a twister?
HANK: Yep.

10:00.440 --> 10:04.308
A big Texas-sized twister, I tell you what.

10:04.678 --> 10:08.774
Well, that dang twister
sucked his boots plumb off.

10:09.149 --> 10:12.016
Well, you can't bury a man
in his stocking feet.

10:12.085 --> 10:15.782
It's the Cowboy Code.
So I gave him my boots.

10:15.855 --> 10:18.915
And that's the story
of what happened to my boots.

10:18.992 --> 10:21.051
This is great, J. R!

10:21.127 --> 10:24.654
I always thought you were afraid
to wear boots 'cause your toes are fat.

10:25.065 --> 10:27.533
In the summer of 1953...

10:27.601 --> 10:30.695
something that I treasure
happened right there in that pink house.

10:30.770 --> 10:31.737
What, Peggy?

10:31.805 --> 10:35.366
The noted poet Ogden Nash
wrote his poem, The Cow.

10:35.508 --> 10:37.635
"The cow is of the bovine ilk

10:38.011 --> 10:40.571
"One end is moo, the other, milk"

10:45.785 --> 10:46.911
[Grunting]

10:47.020 --> 10:48.180
Sir...

10:48.755 --> 10:53.283
I don't really recommend a cowboy boot
for a chubby-toed customer like yourself.

10:53.560 --> 10:56.154
You might want to try
a Birkenstock sandal.

10:56.329 --> 10:57.956
Shut the hell up.

10:59.432 --> 11:02.629
- Here's your spurs, J. R!
- I helped pick 'em out.

11:03.503 --> 11:05.767
Well, that sure would complete the outfit.

11:05.839 --> 11:08.034
But I don't want to scar the carpet.

11:08.108 --> 11:11.100
Who cares about the carpet?
You hurt my feelings.

11:11.911 --> 11:14.402
You know what else he needs? A hat.

11:14.814 --> 11:17.783
Yeah. Yeah! A big old cowboy hat!

11:17.851 --> 11:21.014
I want to see Texas
with a guy in a big cowboy hat like mine!

11:21.087 --> 11:23.146
I'm not wearing a dumb hat!

11:23.289 --> 11:24.415
[Sighs angrily]

11:24.491 --> 11:29.428
I thought you were a real Texan, like that
Thatherton fellow from the coffee shop.

11:30.363 --> 11:34.356
I'm only not wearing the hat
because of my solemn vow...

11:34.434 --> 11:37.426
I made to President
Lyndon Baines Johnson...

11:37.937 --> 11:41.532
on the occasion
of the birth of his daughter, Lynda Bird.

11:43.009 --> 11:45.443
Lyndon Johnson killed our Kennedy.

11:50.350 --> 11:51.612
HOLLOWAY: And this!

11:52.986 --> 11:55.978
BOOHMHAUER: Hey, man! Look at that
rhinestone cowboy, man!

11:57.357 --> 11:59.257
Oh, Lord. Not now!

11:59.325 --> 12:02.055
Look, J.R., an Injun! And a hillbilly!

12:02.395 --> 12:03.953
Hey, man!

12:04.030 --> 12:07.431
You might wanna call
Dr. Scholl's, man, 911!

12:07.734 --> 12:10.066
Y'all look like that
dang old Hoss Cartwright...

12:10.136 --> 12:11.467
with that old crap, man, yo.

12:12.605 --> 12:14.698
[Holloway laughing]

12:18.845 --> 12:20.142
[Hank screaming]

12:20.213 --> 12:22.704
Toe cramp! Toe cramp! Hurry!

12:23.450 --> 12:26.385
All right. What is going on, Hank?

12:26.453 --> 12:28.819
The way Bobby tells it,
you bought my freedom...

12:28.888 --> 12:31.049
from the Comanches
with your rodeo winnings?

12:31.124 --> 12:33.354
And you were worth every penny.

12:35.128 --> 12:36.152
[Hesitates]

12:36.229 --> 12:39.665
Look, Peggy, being a salesman
is a little like being an actor.

12:39.733 --> 12:41.963
I'm just playing a role, you know...

12:42.035 --> 12:44.936
like that fella at the dinner theater
you liked so much.

12:45.305 --> 12:48.900
This is not Camelot,
and you are not Jason Alexander.

12:49.242 --> 12:50.266
[Hesitates]

12:50.343 --> 12:52.436
You're not wearing that
to dinner, are you?

12:52.512 --> 12:55.538
What? You don't like it?
I got this pantsuit special for tonight.

12:55.615 --> 12:56.775
It's from Frumpy's.

12:56.850 --> 12:59.648
HANK: Yeah. Don't you still have
that bridesmaid outfit...

12:59.719 --> 13:02.051
you wore to one of Luanne's
mama's weddings?

13:02.489 --> 13:03.956
Oh, here!

13:04.124 --> 13:07.093
You know, I'd forgotten
just how pretty this is.

13:11.097 --> 13:15.261
Hey, Dad? I was going over the stuff
you told Mr. Holloway.

13:15.368 --> 13:19.805
How could Mom get pregnant with me
if you spent the '80s...

13:19.873 --> 13:21.773
in a Mexican POW camp?

13:21.908 --> 13:25.309
Look, Bobby, some of that stuff...

13:25.445 --> 13:27.379
The details aren't so important.

13:27.447 --> 13:29.938
I gotta get my facts straight, Dad!

13:30.016 --> 13:32.541
There's a Q and A
after my speech tomorrow.

13:32.619 --> 13:34.849
And these Sunday-school kids are tough!

13:34.921 --> 13:36.684
I'll help you, son. I promise.

13:36.756 --> 13:38.917
When I get home tonight, we'll sit down...

13:38.992 --> 13:42.484
and go over anything
you might have taken out of context.

13:47.767 --> 13:51.362
Oh, I am so sorry Mrs. Holloway
didn't feel well enough to join us.

13:51.437 --> 13:54.201
Maybe what she ate on the plane
didn't agree with her.

13:55.108 --> 13:58.635
LUANNE: Hi, Mrs. Holloway.
Want some cold Frito pie?

14:00.280 --> 14:01.804
She'll be fine.

14:01.881 --> 14:05.544
Besides, every man needs to be cut
from his ball and chain, now and again.

14:05.618 --> 14:07.552
Ain't that right, J. R?

14:10.857 --> 14:13.223
WOMAN: Mr. Hill, your table is ready.

14:13.560 --> 14:16.028
The 4-top at 39 needs more iced tea, hon.

14:16.095 --> 14:18.723
86, the jalapeño corn bread.

14:22.936 --> 14:25.837
Howdy, partners.
Welcome to the Panhandler.

14:25.972 --> 14:29.738
Home of the world's longest salad bar,
and second-longest sneezeguard.

14:30.109 --> 14:33.772
Would you cowboys care to take on
our 72-ounce Lonestar Steak?

14:33.847 --> 14:37.374
- Finish it and it's free.
- How much if you can't finish it?

14:37.450 --> 14:39.816
Well, sir, like my daddy always said:

14:39.886 --> 14:42.218
"If you have to ask, you can't afford it."

14:42.418 --> 14:44.318
That's what I'm having.

14:55.031 --> 14:58.933
Lord, no, Mr. Holloway!
You're gonna fill up on free stuff.

14:59.402 --> 15:02.599
DALE: Hey, Roy Rogers,
Halloween was last year.

15:03.572 --> 15:07.872
Mr. Holloway, these are my neighbors,
Dale and Nancy Gribble.

15:08.044 --> 15:10.638
Mr. Holloway
came all the way from Boston.

15:10.880 --> 15:14.247
Yeah, I know the place.
That's in Tax-achusetts, ain't it?

15:14.417 --> 15:17.318
Say hello to Willie Horton for me
when you get home.

15:17.386 --> 15:19.513
He's teaching at your kindergarten.

15:19.588 --> 15:21.215
I'm sorry, Mr. Gribble.

15:21.290 --> 15:25.192
But a cowboy don't talk politics
at the chow wagon. Happy trails.

15:25.528 --> 15:27.996
I haven't got my croutons yet.

15:30.166 --> 15:31.997
[People cheering]

15:40.242 --> 15:42.506
Oh, stick a fork in me. I'm done.

15:42.578 --> 15:43.772
[People booing]

15:43.846 --> 15:46.747
- No! You're not.
- Give me a quarter, J.R.

15:46.849 --> 15:48.874
I'm gonna go test my grip.

15:51.087 --> 15:55.046
I thought so. You've got something
right there on your back, honey.

15:55.124 --> 15:57.058
- What?
- Footprints.

15:57.393 --> 16:00.419
Break time's over, darling.
The kitchen's backed up.

16:00.496 --> 16:03.863
I have had just about all I can swallow.

16:03.933 --> 16:06.265
How about you, "J.R."?

16:06.435 --> 16:08.926
Peggy, I'm making progress here.

16:09.004 --> 16:12.565
I can always tell
when a customer's ready for the close.

16:12.641 --> 16:15.201
P.A. SYSTEM: Mr. Thatherton,
your table is ready.

16:15.845 --> 16:19.281
Thatherton! And his table is ready!
I gotta go!

16:22.118 --> 16:23.847
[Laughing]

16:26.388 --> 16:29.687
J.R., my friend Thatherton
is taking me to that club...

16:29.759 --> 16:33.217
where all the waitresses
are former Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders.

16:33.295 --> 16:34.557
Too late, Thatherton.

16:34.630 --> 16:37.656
If anyone's taking Holloway
to a gentleman's club, it's me!

16:37.933 --> 16:40.561
Well, then I'll see you over there, then.

16:41.403 --> 16:43.268
I like that guy.

16:43.672 --> 16:47.733
- Holloway, don't move a muscle.
- Get me some protection, too!

16:54.683 --> 16:58.346
BOBBY: [Flashback] The man
I admire most is my dad, Hank Hill.

17:05.294 --> 17:07.660
Okay, have fun, boys.

17:09.431 --> 17:11.523
I thought you might be mad.

17:14.403 --> 17:17.634
'Cause I was suppose to help Bobby,
and instead...

17:18.040 --> 17:21.441
we're going to Jug Store Cowboys...

17:23.279 --> 17:27.443
as part of my work-required
sales excursion.

17:28.517 --> 17:32.647
That, as I said, keeps you
in pretty dresses like that one.

17:32.855 --> 17:33.879
Get out.

17:36.292 --> 17:37.316
[Sighing]

17:37.393 --> 17:39.486
HANK: Peggy, could you loan me...

17:40.496 --> 17:42.430
$50 ought to cover it.

17:42.598 --> 17:45.795
And can I have ones, you know...

17:45.868 --> 17:48.132
for the G-strings?

17:49.538 --> 17:51.130
[Tires screeching]

17:53.175 --> 17:55.439
HANK: How versatile is propane?

17:55.511 --> 17:57.502
Well, propane will do everything...

17:57.580 --> 18:00.572
that natural gas will do, and more.

18:01.183 --> 18:04.016
Please, ma'am!
I'm trying to carry on a conversation!

18:04.086 --> 18:06.554
Yeah, yeah, I see your rear, very nice.

18:06.622 --> 18:10.023
Okay, there's some people over there
that want to look, too.

18:10.392 --> 18:12.360
Now, how about it, Mr. Holloway?

18:12.428 --> 18:15.659
Will you say yes to Strickland Propane?

18:15.731 --> 18:19.360
- Buy me a mint julep.
- Heck, that's not a Texas drink.

18:19.435 --> 18:22.165
You can't even
keep your stereotypes straight.

18:22.238 --> 18:26.868
Hey, come on, buy me a mint julep.
Then I'll talk to you about propane.

18:27.076 --> 18:28.270
[Sighing]

18:29.445 --> 18:31.106
Mint julep, please.

18:31.280 --> 18:35.410
- Mint julep?
- It's not for me. I got a Yankee client.

18:36.785 --> 18:38.946
- He make you wear that hat?
- Yep.

18:39.021 --> 18:41.080
Oh, honey, I know exactly how you feel.

18:41.156 --> 18:44.182
Every night, my boss makes me
put on this humiliating outfit...

18:44.260 --> 18:46.854
to seduce some drunk out of his money.

18:47.196 --> 18:48.857
We're a lot alike.

18:51.166 --> 18:52.963
Why do we do it...

18:54.470 --> 18:55.698
Chiffon?

18:55.838 --> 18:57.772
We do it for the money, cowboy.

18:57.940 --> 19:01.034
I never made six figures a year
at the Potato Hut.

19:01.644 --> 19:03.771
- Six figures?
- Oh, yeah.

19:04.146 --> 19:07.547
Soon, I'll have enough to stay home
with my granddaughter and her baby.

19:07.616 --> 19:09.106
I should be home, too...

19:09.184 --> 19:12.153
helping my boy
with his Sunday-school report.

19:13.022 --> 19:15.456
Hey, how about a lap dance?

19:17.293 --> 19:20.387
- Honey, what are you still doing up?
- I don't get it.

19:20.462 --> 19:23.158
How could he have fought
in the Spanish-American War...

19:23.232 --> 19:27.601
the same year he invented the world's
first pressure-cooking chicken fryer?

19:27.970 --> 19:31.667
Oh, Bobby, your father
never fought in any war.

19:31.740 --> 19:34.208
Oh, I know. I've given up on Dad.

19:34.543 --> 19:38.502
The man I most admire now
is Col. Sanders.

19:39.081 --> 19:43.017
Here's your julep, Holloway.
Let's talk propane.

19:46.722 --> 19:48.349
You call this a mint julep?

19:48.424 --> 19:51.188
Where's the vodka?
Where's the tomato juice?

19:51.260 --> 19:54.593
Maybe I ought to let Thatherton
buy my drinks from now on.

19:54.663 --> 19:56.290
I tell you what!

19:58.701 --> 20:01.101
Mister, I'll tell you what!

20:01.170 --> 20:03.832
I don't want your business! Not this way!

20:03.906 --> 20:06.170
You wanna go with Thatherton? Go!

20:06.241 --> 20:10.337
But one of these days, when your
propane mixture's only 89 percent...

20:10.512 --> 20:13.913
and you have a smelly
condo development full of crying babies...

20:13.983 --> 20:16.247
whose bottles
haven't been properly heated...

20:16.318 --> 20:19.754
you give me a call. My name is Hank Hill.

20:19.855 --> 20:22.847
And I sell propane
and propane accessories...

20:23.058 --> 20:24.992
with honor and dignity!

20:25.461 --> 20:28.259
Them's fighting words, J.R.

20:28.530 --> 20:31.966
This isn't a John Wayne movie, Holloway!

20:32.034 --> 20:36.027
- I'm not gonna fight you.
- I'll fight you, pilgrim!

20:36.538 --> 20:38.472
Yee-haw!

20:43.946 --> 20:45.709
BOBBY: He doesn't have an oil well.

20:46.081 --> 20:48.208
He doesn't own a Cadillac.

20:48.350 --> 20:52.480
And he doesn't wear cowboy boots,
because he's not a cowboy.

20:52.888 --> 20:55.618
And on account of they squish his toes.

20:55.691 --> 20:59.058
But the man I admire most is a real Texan.

20:59.528 --> 21:02.588
He is my daddy, Hank Hill.

21:05.100 --> 21:07.500
That's my boy! Yeah!

21:08.170 --> 21:09.865
Thank you. Thank you.

21:10.305 --> 21:13.035
And I want to thank my dad...

21:13.108 --> 21:17.704
specially for accepting me
and raising me as his own...

21:17.980 --> 21:20.414
even though I was fathered
by another man...

21:20.482 --> 21:24.578
while Mr. Hank Hill
was in a Mexican POW Camp.

21:25.087 --> 21:26.349
Thank you.

21:30.159 --> 21:31.768
