00:15.383 --> 00:16.415
( cheering )

00:16.417 --> 00:18.283
Oh! Hey everybody!

00:18.285 --> 00:20.853
Welcome back to johnny nim...

00:20.855 --> 00:21.954
Bus-ta-move's,

00:21.956 --> 00:23.389
Dancing new year's eve.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.424
We are here live

00:25.426 --> 00:26.959
From the cultural mecca

00:26.961 --> 00:30.329
Of steven's point,
clancy's dairy farm.

00:31.265 --> 00:35.234
Oh, and our famous
sparkly onion
is on the rise

00:35.236 --> 00:37.703
Cause we're a mere
four hours away
from midnight!

00:37.705 --> 00:39.872
And with me is
hometown celebrity

00:39.874 --> 00:42.474
- Liv rooney!
- ( cheering )

00:44.345 --> 00:45.611
Well, thank you,
johnny.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.246
You just watched
the top five
cat interviews

00:47.248 --> 00:48.647
That johnny
did this year.

00:48.649 --> 00:49.815
Meow-za.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.984
( laughs )
all gems.

00:51.986 --> 00:53.986
Hey, and speaking
of cool cats,

00:53.988 --> 00:56.955
Let's welcome
our favorite
novelty dancer,

00:56.957 --> 00:58.590
The clogmaster!

00:59.527 --> 01:01.026
( whooping )

01:09.236 --> 01:11.336
Clog on,
clogmaster.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.540
Oh.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.241
Look at you.

01:16.243 --> 01:19.244
You should be down
at clancy's whooping it up
with your sister.

01:19.246 --> 01:20.646
By the way,
i can drive you if you want.

01:20.648 --> 01:21.880
( laughs )
nice try, mom,

01:21.882 --> 01:23.415
But i know liv
banned you from going.

01:23.417 --> 01:25.918
Oh, no no.
She was just teasing.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.620
As if i'd jump up on stage
and start playing the flute.

01:28.622 --> 01:30.022
By the way,
have you seen my flute?

01:30.024 --> 01:31.690
Did she hide it?

01:33.527 --> 01:35.561
Mom, no one
hid your flute.

01:35.563 --> 01:37.329
I totally
hid her flute...

01:38.365 --> 01:39.998
And tied it
like a pretzel.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.267
( chuckles )

01:42.269 --> 01:43.502
( plays flute poorly )

01:46.040 --> 01:48.740
So you're sure you're fine
just staying in on new year's?

01:48.742 --> 01:50.943
Yeah.
Just, you know.

01:50.945 --> 01:52.311
Getting my clog on.

01:53.047 --> 01:54.580
I'm not even
a little bit upset

01:54.582 --> 01:56.582
At the fact
that i finally
have a boyfriend,

01:56.584 --> 01:58.283
That it's
new year's eve,

01:58.285 --> 01:59.751
And he's
a million miles away

01:59.753 --> 02:02.121
In the icy wasteland
that is tundrabania

02:02.123 --> 02:04.656
Instead of here
hanging out with me.

02:04.658 --> 02:05.958
And why did
he go, mom?

02:05.960 --> 02:08.327
( sobbing )
why, why, why did he go?

02:10.598 --> 02:12.598
Yeah, you don't seem
upset at all, honey.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.966
Pete:
<i>Hey, maddie!</i>

02:13.968 --> 02:17.603
<i>Got a special delivery</i>
<i>all the way from tundrabania!</i>

02:17.605 --> 02:19.738
( gasps )
it's diggie!

02:19.740 --> 02:22.407
I told him that i really, really
wanted to be together
on new year's eve,

02:22.409 --> 02:23.709
And now he's here
to surprise me!

02:23.711 --> 02:24.810
He's here.
It's diggie!

02:30.751 --> 02:32.451
You're not diggie.

02:33.521 --> 02:35.254
No.

02:35.255 --> 02:36.988
I'm just the guy who lugged
this heavy box all the way
up the stairs

02:36.991 --> 02:38.090
Just for you.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.859
You're welcome.

02:43.030 --> 02:44.696
I sent maddie
everything she needs

02:44.698 --> 02:47.065
To celebrate a traditional
tundrabanian new year's eve.

02:47.067 --> 02:48.567
We're gonna
facegab at midnight.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.636
Internet's hard
to come by in tundrabania,

02:50.638 --> 02:51.670
But i bought time...

02:51.672 --> 02:53.539
By selling my pet walrus.

02:55.609 --> 02:57.643
You know what?
Doesn't even matter.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.645
Because diggie
is so romantic

02:59.647 --> 03:00.946
That i'm sure
whatever's in this box

03:00.948 --> 03:02.481
Is gonna be
really cool.

03:02.483 --> 03:05.517
So... Ah!

03:12.059 --> 03:13.692
Or...

03:13.694 --> 03:15.093

the clown!

04:18.092 --> 04:20.092
Two turntables
and a rainbow wig.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.795
You spin those
wheels of steel, terry!

04:23.797 --> 04:25.764
I love it. Give me some of that.
All right.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.667
And stay tuned folks,
because just after midnight

04:28.669 --> 04:30.936
I will be debuting
my brand new single

04:30.938 --> 04:32.537
"you and me,
and the beat."

04:32.539 --> 04:36.141
Oh, i can't wait.
Hey, the word around
the hayloft is

04:36.143 --> 04:39.111
You're here to talk about
an exciting new gizmo.

04:39.113 --> 04:41.613
That's right, johnny. This is
actually the very first time

04:41.615 --> 04:42.948
That i have ever
endorsed a product.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.050
Oh!
This is exciting!

04:45.052 --> 04:47.619
It's the dry by liv
hair dryer.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.589
Wanna be flyer?
Buy this dryer.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.793
In an attempt to support our
young celebrity entrepreneur,

04:54.795 --> 04:56.128
We let her use
our credit card

04:56.130 --> 04:58.530
To order her initial
shipment of 100.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.866
1-0-0.

05:01.835 --> 05:04.903
Yeah, except there was
a sticky zero key,

05:04.905 --> 05:08.106
And i accidentally
ordered 10,000.

05:09.076 --> 05:12.110
1-0-0-0-0.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.181
Isn't that hilarious?

05:17.117 --> 05:18.650
The dry by liv is
the most powerful

05:18.652 --> 05:19.918
Hair dryer
in the world.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.120
So to demonstrate,
terry the clown
is gonna

05:22.122 --> 05:24.189
Help me show
just how powerful
it really is.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.757
Okay.

05:25.759 --> 05:27.959
( dryer blowing )

05:34.201 --> 05:37.169
And that, folks,
was on the low
setting. Okay.

05:38.238 --> 05:40.572
All right,
steven's point!

05:40.574 --> 05:43.909
Now it is time
for johnny versus
dairy farm dave

05:43.911 --> 05:46.044
In a high-stakes
new year's eve
milk-off.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.579
- ( cow moos )
- sleeves up, dave.

05:47.581 --> 05:49.147
You're about to
get pasteurized.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.215
Come on.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.986
We're missing
the milk off.

05:54.988 --> 05:59.057
I can't believe you
and your stupid flute
got us banned.

05:59.059 --> 06:03.128
Oh, and i'm sure your
funky fresh dance moves
had nothing to do with it.

06:04.798 --> 06:06.198
Boys, stop.

06:07.634 --> 06:10.836
Why are you dragging
a dirty gutter
inside the house?

06:10.838 --> 06:13.805
'cause it's too cold
to clean it outside.

06:15.109 --> 06:17.843
And it's on our
new year's chore list.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.178
No time to talk.
We've gotta get it done
before midnight.

06:22.649 --> 06:26.685
Mom and dad said that
if we finish this crazy
long list of chores

06:26.687 --> 06:27.986
By the end
of this year,

06:27.988 --> 06:31.556
They would buy us
anything we wanted.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.993
We picked a two-man
swan paddle boat.

06:34.995 --> 06:36.828
How cool is that?

06:36.830 --> 06:39.798
Would you look at the joy
on these people's faces?

06:43.637 --> 06:45.270
The list!

06:45.272 --> 06:47.139
They weren't
supposed to finish.

06:47.141 --> 06:50.108
You said they'd do
a few chores in january,
forget it by spring,

06:50.110 --> 06:52.043
And we'd
owe them nothing.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.078
Relax.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.646
They never
finish anything.

06:54.648 --> 06:57.015
Parker doesn't even
flush when he's done.

06:57.951 --> 06:59.651
<i>( toilet flushing )</i>

07:01.889 --> 07:04.022
Flushed and polished.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.091
So clean you could
serve soup in it.

07:08.195 --> 07:10.896
Mmm.
Man, this soup
is delicious.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.038
Why do you
hate romance,

07:20.040 --> 07:22.240
You stupid
block of ice!

07:23.977 --> 07:25.343
Use the dry by liv.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.980
It's not just for hair.
This thing does everything.

07:28.982 --> 07:31.183
I just reheated
a pork chop.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.122
( dryer blowing )

07:40.093 --> 07:41.193
Whoa.

07:42.362 --> 07:43.728
Amazing.

07:43.730 --> 07:44.763
Yeah.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.331
It's one heck
of a dryer.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.134
Now tell your friends,
cause we need to move
10,000 of those.

07:50.337 --> 07:52.137
Oh, yes!

07:52.139 --> 07:54.039
Diggie left me a note.

07:54.041 --> 07:55.740
"hey, rooney."
( laughs )

07:55.742 --> 07:58.109
That's me.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.845
"enclosed is
everything you'll need

07:59.847 --> 08:02.414
For our tundrabanian
new year's eve celebration."

08:02.416 --> 08:05.650
( gasps )
so you guys are gonna
facegab at midnight?

08:05.652 --> 08:07.819
Sounds fun.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.056
"we'll make the cry
of a pregnant narwhal,

08:11.058 --> 08:14.125
Drink yak milk
from a chalice,

08:14.127 --> 08:17.062
And do a traditional
tundrabanian tribal dance

08:17.064 --> 08:18.396
In fake fur."

08:19.333 --> 08:22.000
Sounds more weird
than fun now.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.019
Oh, yeah?

08:24.020 --> 08:26.037
When was the last time
dad brought you yak milk?

08:27.140 --> 08:29.040
You're not actually
gonna wear that,
are you?

08:31.044 --> 08:33.011
♪ tundra,
tundrabania ♪

08:33.013 --> 08:34.846
♪ tundra,

08:34.848 --> 08:36.147
♪ tundra,

08:40.120 --> 08:42.187
Would it kill you to
send me yak milk
just once?!

08:47.127 --> 08:48.927
All right,
steven's point.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.962
It looks like
it is just about
two hours

08:50.964 --> 08:52.063
Until midnight,

08:52.065 --> 08:54.099
So buy your
dry by liv now.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.269
Okay.
Really, though,
please buy.

08:58.205 --> 08:59.704
Two hours left
on the clock,

08:59.706 --> 09:02.240
And out of the 10,000
i have sold six.

09:02.242 --> 09:03.808
( chuckles )

09:03.810 --> 09:06.811
Hey, kids, are mom
and dad asleep?

09:06.813 --> 09:08.880
Do you know
where their
credit card is?

09:10.751 --> 09:13.318
Buy one
for yourself.
Hey! Buy two.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.488
You know what?
Hey, if you call
right now,

09:16.490 --> 09:19.090
I will come to
your house and dry
your hair for you.

09:27.501 --> 09:29.801
All righty,
tarp is up.

09:29.802 --> 09:32.102
Let's check the next chore
off our swan paddle boat list.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.773
"clean chimney."

09:34.774 --> 09:37.442
Then we can move onto
"clear family of squirrels
from attic."

09:40.080 --> 09:41.746
Prepare blowers.

09:43.383 --> 09:45.817
Blowers on.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.852
( dryers blowing )

09:47.854 --> 09:49.120
Whoa.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.456
Okay.

09:51.458 --> 09:54.125
Well, if we do not get
our swan paddle boat,

09:54.127 --> 09:57.162
We can strap these
to the back of our innertubes
and zip across the lake.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.865
We're getting
the paddle boat.

10:00.867 --> 10:02.067
To the chimney!

10:05.472 --> 10:07.005
Blowers on!

10:07.007 --> 10:08.873
( dryers blowing )

10:13.246 --> 10:14.512
They're almost
finished.

10:14.514 --> 10:15.780
We're toast.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.082
Mama's got it
handled.

10:18.318 --> 10:19.784
What are you doing?

10:19.786 --> 10:21.486
I'm adding something
to their list.

10:21.488 --> 10:22.787
Something so
disgusting,

10:22.789 --> 10:25.123
So demeaning,
so soul crushing,

10:25.125 --> 10:26.825
They will
never do it.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.212
You're bad.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.397
I know. My new year's
resolution is to be
a better person.

10:32.399 --> 10:35.233
Luckily, that doesn't
start till tomorrow.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.805
All right.
Let's hear it
for ranger mike

10:40.807 --> 10:42.207
From steven's point
caverns

10:42.209 --> 10:44.009
- And his

"liv rooney,

11:55.182 --> 11:58.216
Do you like being

11:58.218 --> 11:59.884
Way to dig deep
there, clay.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.621
No, johnny,
i actually think that
is a great question.

12:03.623 --> 12:06.257
And clay, i have
a question for you.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.159
Do you have

12:09.596 --> 12:11.296
Would you like

12:13.366 --> 12:16.201
Okay, come on now,

Thank you.

Larrabee nimbus.

12:23.210 --> 12:25.076
Hey, lar. He asks,
"liv rooney,

12:25.078 --> 12:26.377
Is it true
that while shooting

12:26.379 --> 12:28.146
The 'froyo yolo'
video,

12:28.148 --> 12:30.548
That you kissed
your sister's
boyfriend diggie?"

12:30.550 --> 12:32.217
( spits )

12:33.220 --> 12:34.652
( chuckles )

12:34.654 --> 12:37.589
Oh, wow.

12:37.591 --> 12:39.691
That was just
such a long time
ago, johnny.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.593
- I can't even--
- oh, no no.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.495
I'm sure you would
remember that.
I've seen that guy.

12:43.497 --> 12:45.130
He's a tall drink
of hot water.

12:45.132 --> 12:47.465
I mean, i take it
your answer is no.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.034
Yes, johnny.

12:50.036 --> 12:52.337
I totally kissed
my sister's
boyfriend.

12:52.339 --> 12:53.538
( chuckles )

12:53.540 --> 12:55.240
Of course
my answer is no.

12:56.643 --> 12:59.144
Did she just do
sarcastic jazz hands?

12:59.146 --> 13:01.279
Okay, when liv
gets sarcastic

13:01.281 --> 13:02.797
And she makes
jazz hands,

13:02.798 --> 13:04.314
It means that
she is hiding something.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.286
Like the truth doesn't matter
if you have enough pizzazz.

13:09.656 --> 13:10.688
She kissed him.

13:10.690 --> 13:13.124
My sister
kissed my boyfriend.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.327
Larrabee,
it's garbage
like that

13:16.329 --> 13:18.530
That keeps you
from getting invited
to thanksgiving.

She asks, "hey,
what's with the
sarcastic jazz hands?

13:29.743 --> 13:31.476
Are you hiding
something?"

13:31.478 --> 13:32.677

13:32.679 --> 13:34.145
Yeah.

13:34.147 --> 13:35.613
I'm trying to
cover up the fact

13:35.615 --> 13:38.049
That i totally kissed
her boyfriend.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.151
You really did
kiss him!

13:47.294 --> 13:48.993
Oh, this one's not
a question, though.

13:48.995 --> 13:50.562
It just says,
"i'm destroying

Why did you do
the sarcastic jazz hand thing?

I was being sarcastic
because it wasn't
really a kiss.

jazz hands.

First rule of sales,

21:44.937 --> 21:47.538
Nothing makes you want
to buy a hair dryer

21:47.540 --> 21:49.857
Like a hit song,

21:49.858 --> 21:52.175
So i created a deal
that no one could pass up:

21:52.178 --> 21:54.011
Buy a dry by liv,

21:54.013 --> 21:55.946
Get a free download.

21:55.948 --> 21:58.215
We sold out in literally
seven minutes.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.719
Happy new year,
everyone!

22:09.095 --> 22:11.062
Another chore list?
Are you crazy?

22:11.064 --> 22:13.931
We cheated,
and they still beat us.

22:13.933 --> 22:17.201
Well, i have a feeling
the boys won't be
quite as motivated

22:17.203 --> 22:19.170
Now that their
dream came true.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.809
Oh, man.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.110
I can't feel
my feet.

22:26.112 --> 22:28.245
I think they're
frozen to the pedals.

22:28.247 --> 22:30.915
But as soon as
the lake unfreezes,

22:30.917 --> 22:33.117
We'll be the coolest
guys on the water.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.920
( mimicking swans )

22:35.922 --> 22:38.055
( whimpering )

22:39.092 --> 22:40.958
This is--
this is cool, right?

22:40.960 --> 22:43.828
Oh, man. I was really following
your lead on this one.
