WEBVTT

00:25.942 --> 00:26.985
Yeah!

00:52.135 --> 00:53.261
Servodriver.

00:54.429 --> 00:55.764
Hydrospanner.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.310
Done! Thanks, RJ.

01:00.310 --> 01:04.564
The <i>Crimson Bolt</i> is ready to roll...
er, sail.

01:04.564 --> 01:08.735
The point is, we're gonna win
the Kublop Classic for sure this year.

01:09.819 --> 01:11.279
I'm so excited!

01:12.322 --> 01:15.658
We're gonna race other kids
across the rivers of Kublop Springs.

01:15.658 --> 01:18.328
Yep. It's one of my favorite traditions.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.913
We do it every year.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.707
And we get to race
with the best pilot we know.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.466
Your racing skiff looks great.

01:31.466 --> 01:34.427
Nash designed it,
and we helped build it.

01:34.427 --> 01:37.680
Master Zia, thanks for letting
these three join my crew today.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.975
I've never had a team
to help me race the Kublop Classic before.

01:40.975 --> 01:43.269
Nubs, show Master Zia the sail.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.401
Oh, no!
Oops.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.462
I'll help you, Nubs.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.722
Well done, younglings.

02:19.722 --> 02:21.558
Nice trick.

02:21.558 --> 02:24.853
Everyone, this is Raena Zess.

02:24.853 --> 02:27.355
Oh, you mean the girl
who you told us about?

02:27.480 --> 02:31.025
The one who always wins the races
'cause she has a better ship than you

02:31.025 --> 02:33.027
and you never ever, ever beat her?

02:33.027 --> 02:34.988
B-But this year's gonna be different.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.951
Oh?
Check out my brand-new racing skiff.

02:39.951 --> 02:42.120
The best my uncle's credits can buy.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.664
- Wow, that looks fast.
- Whoa.

02:44.664 --> 02:47.250
And you even got droids to help?

02:49.502 --> 02:52.839
Yep, well,
I've got the best crew in the galaxy.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.257
My friends are Jedi.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.676
- They've got Force powers.

02:57.260 --> 02:58.678
We're definitely gonna win.

02:58.678 --> 03:00.597
We'll see about that.

03:03.391 --> 03:07.520
Nash, Jedi train in the Force
to help people, not to win races.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.856
Not all racers are trained like we are.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.066
It would be unfair
for us to use the Force.

03:12.066 --> 03:13.151
Oh.

03:13.151 --> 03:16.070
So, no Jedi stuff during the race then?

03:16.070 --> 03:17.405
It would be cheating.

03:21.701 --> 03:25.038
I'm sure the five of you working together
will be more than enough to win.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.372
And win fairly.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.458
You're a very talented pilot.

03:28.458 --> 03:30.752
Yeah, and we'll be right there with you.

03:30.752 --> 03:33.338
We'll do everything we can
to help you win.

03:34.505 --> 03:39.594
Racers, please take your places
for the Kublop Classic!

03:40.220 --> 03:42.180
Everyone knows what to do, right?

03:42.180 --> 03:45.266
Kai, you're on speed control
with the engine and the brakes.

03:45.266 --> 03:48.311
Nubs, your strength will help us
with sharp turns on the sail.

03:48.311 --> 03:50.230
Lys, you look out for obstacles.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.190
- RJ, you're with me.

03:52.190 --> 03:54.234
And I, of course, will be the pilot.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.946
We love you, Nash!

03:57.946 --> 04:00.240
- Hi, Mom! Hi, Mama!

04:09.540 --> 04:11.292
On your marks.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.378
Get set.

04:14.587 --> 04:15.672
Go!

04:19.676 --> 04:21.094
Kai, we need more speed!

04:22.387 --> 04:23.805
Yes! Just like that.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.807
Big tree root, straight ahead!

04:26.724 --> 04:28.268
Uh-oh. Thanks, Lys!

04:28.268 --> 04:30.520
Nubs, sharp turn. Now!

04:35.733 --> 04:37.151
No!

04:37.151 --> 04:39.487
Whoa! That was close.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.197
- Nice job, Nubs.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.789
- I can't see.
- Where are we?

04:53.084 --> 04:55.336
- That's not allowed. Raena's cheating!

04:57.422 --> 04:59.090
But that's not gonna stop us.

05:06.514 --> 05:07.932
Nice move, Nash.

05:07.932 --> 05:09.767
It's just us and Raena now.

05:13.521 --> 05:15.106
- Hang on!

05:15.106 --> 05:17.025
Whoa!

05:21.154 --> 05:24.532
Those Jedi must be using
their powers to help Nash.

05:24.532 --> 05:25.616
No fair!

05:25.616 --> 05:29.287
Well, I've still got a few more tricks
of my own.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.957
Turbo-boosters? That's not allowed.

05:32.957 --> 05:35.168
- She's cheating again.

05:35.168 --> 05:36.753
Nash! The waterfall!

05:38.463 --> 05:40.256
We're going down that?

05:40.256 --> 05:43.301
Of course.
The <i>Crimson Bolt</i> was built for anything.

05:45.219 --> 05:48.056
Okay, when I say "now," Nubs,
turn the sail.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.557
Kai, give us some speed.

05:49.557 --> 05:51.642
And RJ, open up those flaps.

05:51.642 --> 05:52.769
Now!

05:59.484 --> 06:00.860
Whoa!

06:09.202 --> 06:10.203
Huh?

06:12.789 --> 06:14.499
Oh, no! Raena's winning.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.876
No, no, no. I can't lose to her again!

06:18.961 --> 06:20.713
Nash!

06:22.298 --> 06:24.467
Nash, we're almost at the bottom!

06:27.178 --> 06:28.388
Nubs, the sail!

06:44.529 --> 06:46.280
Oh, gasket-thrusters!

06:46.280 --> 06:48.783
I let Raena distract me,
and now we're stuck.

06:48.783 --> 06:51.411
Raena's stuck too.

06:51.411 --> 06:53.037
That means we can still win.

06:53.037 --> 06:56.833
We just gotta pull the <i>Crimson Bolt</i> out of
the mud so we can finish the race.

06:56.833 --> 06:58.251
Come on!

07:07.760 --> 07:09.762
- We're not strong enough.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.140
I know I shouldn't ask,

07:12.140 --> 07:16.644
but can't you just, you know,
use your Jedi powers?

07:16.644 --> 07:20.606
Nash, remember what Master Zia said
about using the Force?

07:20.606 --> 07:23.776
It's for helping others, not for cheating.

07:23.776 --> 07:25.445
We'll figure something out.

07:25.445 --> 07:28.698
I just-- Raena always
makes me feel bad when she wins.

07:28.698 --> 07:32.535
She brags and walks around town
like she's the best racer ever.

07:33.369 --> 07:35.538
Just once I wanted to beat her.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.291
I guess I'm not good enough.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.293
Not good enough?

07:40.293 --> 07:44.630
Nash, we just went down a waterfall
on a skiff you designed.

07:44.630 --> 07:48.468
And you did all that
because you're Nash Durango,

07:48.468 --> 07:50.928
the best pilot in the Outer Rim.

07:50.928 --> 07:54.724
And you're not the best because of some
fancy skiff or Force powers.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.561
You're the best because you're you.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.317
- Thanks, buddy.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.569
Together to the end.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.238
Together.

08:10.156 --> 08:11.866
- Hurry up!

08:12.783 --> 08:13.784
Hey, Raena!

08:13.784 --> 08:16.871
I bet if we work together,
we can free both our skiffs.

08:16.871 --> 08:21.334
Can't those Jedi just use
their special powers to get you out?

08:22.793 --> 08:25.671
That's right.
Using the Force would be cheating.

08:25.671 --> 08:27.131
Jedi don't cheat.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.466
But I-I-I thought--

08:28.466 --> 08:31.427
W-Wait, you weren't using
your powers before?

08:32.178 --> 08:33.179
Nope.

08:34.096 --> 08:38.309
Oh. Well, I only cheated
because I thought you were cheating,

08:38.309 --> 08:40.561
but I guess I was wrong.

08:40.561 --> 08:44.440
Look, Raena, you can either sit here
stuck in the mud for the rest of the day,

08:45.399 --> 08:49.111
or I can throw you this tow cable,
and we can get both our skiffs free.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.280
Fine.

09:15.012 --> 09:17.098
- We did it! Yes!

09:19.850 --> 09:22.812
There's one last part of the race.
What do you say?

09:22.812 --> 09:25.356
First through the geyser field
is the winner?

09:25.356 --> 09:27.942
You're on. But no tricks.

09:27.942 --> 09:29.235
- No tricks.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.740
On your mark. Get set.

09:34.740 --> 09:35.825
Go!

09:40.580 --> 09:43.291
And here comes Team Crimson Bolt
and Raena Zess

09:43.291 --> 09:46.252
- on the last leg of the race!

09:53.259 --> 09:55.720
Nash! We're not gonna catch her.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.769
- Oh, yes we are.

10:03.769 --> 10:06.230
Lys, find us a geyser
that's ready to blow.

10:10.026 --> 10:11.360
There! The big one.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.993
- Nash!
- What are you doing?

10:18.993 --> 10:22.413
It's okay.
The <i>Crimson Bolt</i> is ready for anything.

10:25.249 --> 10:26.375
Here we go!

10:29.170 --> 10:32.048
Yeah!

10:32.048 --> 10:34.842
- Kai, punch it!

10:44.518 --> 10:47.146
- And Team Crimson Bolt wins!

10:56.697 --> 10:58.115
- Whoo-hoo!
- We did it!

10:58.115 --> 10:59.200
- We did it.

11:12.463 --> 11:13.756
Good race, Raena.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.466
That was fun, I guess.

11:15.466 --> 11:17.385
- Even though we lost.

11:17.385 --> 11:18.969
You're a pretty great racer.

11:18.969 --> 11:21.180
You know, when-- when you're not cheating.

11:21.180 --> 11:23.974
- I'll beat ya next time.

11:23.974 --> 11:25.893
- No tricks?
- No tricks.

11:27.603 --> 11:32.316
The winners of this year's
Kublop Classic are

11:32.316 --> 11:34.860
Team Crimson Bolt!

11:34.860 --> 11:35.986
- Yeah!

11:35.986 --> 11:37.530
- Nice one!

11:37.530 --> 11:39.490
- Yeah!

11:39.490 --> 11:41.701
Good job, sweetie.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.077
Thanks, Mom.

11:43.077 --> 11:44.662
Yeah!

11:44.662 --> 11:46.706
Congratulations, everyone.

11:46.706 --> 11:51.001
I'm proud of you for playing fairly
and for all your great teamwork today.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.586
Let's hear it for our pilot!

11:52.586 --> 11:54.004
- Whoa!

11:54.004 --> 11:56.132
All right!
- Yay, Nash! Whoo-hoo!

11:56.132 --> 11:57.883
We did it! Whoo!

12:05.099 --> 12:06.767
This way, younglings.

12:06.767 --> 12:10.312
Today, we'll be visiting
the Temple library.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.940
The Temple library!

12:12.940 --> 12:17.069
I heard they might have holobooks
on ancient Jedi from the Old Republic.

12:17.069 --> 12:18.571
I'm gonna read them all.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.573
Here we are.

12:20.573 --> 12:24.827
Remember, this is a very old temple,
and the library is being fixed up.

12:24.827 --> 12:28.247
We're still finding ancient rooms
that have been long forgotten,

12:28.831 --> 12:30.875
so please be careful.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.960
Wow!

12:32.960 --> 12:35.212
Ooh!
Whoa!

12:35.212 --> 12:37.673
I'm gonna check out
the section on Jedi history.

12:40.384 --> 12:43.220
I'm gonna find holobooks
on creatures from Tenoo.

12:46.056 --> 12:48.434
This one's about
the kyber crystals on Ilum?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.561
I'm definitely reading this.

12:52.855 --> 12:53.856
Whoa!

12:58.486 --> 12:59.862
Huh?

13:05.201 --> 13:07.411
What's that? Hmm.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.246
- What you doing, Kai?
- Whoa!

13:10.372 --> 13:13.501
- We were wondering where you went.

13:16.587 --> 13:18.839
I don't know what's behind
those old rocks, Nubs.

13:18.839 --> 13:21.091
But it could be a hidden room.

13:21.091 --> 13:24.637
Looks like it hasn't
been touched in forever.

13:29.475 --> 13:32.394
- You thinking what I'm thinking?

13:43.405 --> 13:47.576
Focus.

13:52.581 --> 13:53.666
Come on.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.878
I think this might be
an old Jedi storeroom.

13:57.878 --> 13:59.421
A place to keep things.

13:59.421 --> 14:02.091
I read about this.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.592
It's a krayt dragon tooth.

14:05.511 --> 14:08.389
- Look at all this old stuff.

14:09.265 --> 14:12.893
That symbol looks familiar.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.774
Whoa!

14:18.774 --> 14:21.193
- Whoa.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.570
A star map.

14:24.446 --> 14:26.615
I think it's a signal to something.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.660
Maybe Master Zia knows?

14:32.246 --> 14:33.622
Where did you get this?

14:33.622 --> 14:36.458
We found it in one of those ancient rooms
you talked about.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.335
I've read about these.

14:38.335 --> 14:40.421
It's an old starship tracker.

14:40.421 --> 14:44.758
Pilots would leave them behind so people
could find their ship if it ever got lost.

14:44.758 --> 14:47.261
The <i>Star Seeker.</i>

14:47.261 --> 14:49.221
This tracker leads to the <i>Star Seeker</i>!

14:49.221 --> 14:50.389
- The what?

14:50.389 --> 14:51.515
I read about this.

14:51.515 --> 14:54.351
The pilot of the ship
was a brave adventurer.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.644
That's right, Kai.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.021
Hundreds of years ago,

14:57.021 --> 14:59.982
he explored a big part of this sector
for the Jedi.

14:59.982 --> 15:02.902
He brought back countless artifacts
from his adventures,

15:02.902 --> 15:06.113
but he and the ship
went missing a long time ago.

15:06.113 --> 15:09.533
But that light means the ship
might still be out there.

15:09.533 --> 15:12.578
Looks like it's on a planet
not too far away.

15:12.578 --> 15:15.456
Can we go find out?
I gotta know what happened to it.

15:15.456 --> 15:20.920
Well, Master Yoda did send you here
to learn and explore the galaxy.

15:21.712 --> 15:23.589
So, I say go!

15:23.589 --> 15:24.965
- Explore!
Yes!

15:24.965 --> 15:27.551
I will be very eager to hear
what you find.

15:28.093 --> 15:30.554
- Let's call Nash to pick us up.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.681
We have a lost ship to find.

15:34.099 --> 15:36.018
So, let me get this straight.

15:36.018 --> 15:40.481
You found this weird old star map
in a dusty room at your temple,

15:40.481 --> 15:44.068
and you think it leads
to some kind of long-lost Jedi ship?

15:44.068 --> 15:45.819
- Yep, exactly.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.280
- This is amazing!

15:48.280 --> 15:50.658
<i>♪ Going on adventures
With my Jedi friends ♪</i>

15:50.658 --> 15:53.702
-<i>♪ Hope this fun never ends ♪</i>

15:55.496 --> 15:57.957
What?
It's my new Jedi-friend-adventure song.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.625
Well, I like it.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.254
- RJ says we're here.

16:04.254 --> 16:07.049
- Coming out of hyperspace now.

16:09.927 --> 16:14.390
Whoa! Well, we found the planet,
but we also found an asteroid field.

16:17.309 --> 16:18.978
Yeah, it's scary, Nubs.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.064
But we're with the greatest pilot
in the Outer Rim.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.732
- Right, Nash?

16:24.316 --> 16:27.111
Right. Of course. The greatest.

16:27.861 --> 16:29.780
Whoa! Whoo!

16:32.366 --> 16:34.576
But this is a little scary.

16:34.576 --> 16:35.995
I could use some help.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.997
Kai, Lys, watch out for asteroids.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.165
- Nubs, if any big ones get too close...

16:40.165 --> 16:42.710
...use the ship's cannon
to blast 'em to pieces.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.922
All right, everyone. Hang on.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.298
Whoo-hoo.

16:48.298 --> 16:50.592
- Asteroids! Coming in fast!

16:50.592 --> 16:52.428
On it. Evasive maneuvers.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.974
Nubs, incoming asteroid!

17:08.569 --> 17:09.778
Phew.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.823
Got a bit scary, but we made it through.

17:12.823 --> 17:14.825
Way to go, everyone.

17:14.825 --> 17:17.494
Now, let's land
and find the <i>Star Seeker</i>.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.005
Wow.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.424
This place is completely deserted.

17:30.424 --> 17:32.176
No wonder the ship got lost here.

17:32.176 --> 17:34.219
- The signal's nearby.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.514
Hmm. That way.

17:40.434 --> 17:42.478
You go on ahead.
The <i>Firehawk</i> got banged up.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.521
RJ and I will stay behind to make repairs.

17:44.521 --> 17:46.523
- We'll call if we need any help.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.615
Aw, don't worry. They'll be fine.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.871
It's okay, Nubs.

18:00.871 --> 18:03.040
We'll be fine if we stick together.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.875
I think we're really close.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.753
- If only we could see through this fog.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.594
What was that?

18:16.095 --> 18:18.138
I d-d-d-don't want any visitors.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.306
Go away!

18:19.306 --> 18:21.391
I can't see anything.

18:21.391 --> 18:22.559
We'll fix that.

18:22.559 --> 18:25.896
Let's focus together,
use the Force, and move the fog.

18:36.365 --> 18:39.868
We... [whimpers] ...found the <i>Star Seeker</i>!

18:40.953 --> 18:42.579
Are you Jedi?

18:42.579 --> 18:44.540
Yes, we're Jedi.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.125
I don't believe my sensors.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.085
What in the galaxy are you doing here?

18:48.085 --> 18:49.795
We followed this starship tracker.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.256
I remember this tracker.

18:52.256 --> 18:54.424
Oh, t-t-t-thank the Force you're here.

18:54.424 --> 18:55.509
Oh!

18:56.093 --> 18:57.719
Oh, what's my name again?

18:57.719 --> 18:59.721
Ah, yes. I am OG-LC.

18:59.721 --> 19:02.808
It has been a long time
since I've seen anyone else.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.393
But where are my manners?

19:04.393 --> 19:06.436
Come. Let me show you the ship.

19:08.856 --> 19:12.693
And... [buzzes] ...here's where I kept
everything I found during my last trip.

19:12.693 --> 19:15.112
OG, what happened to the pilot?

19:15.112 --> 19:16.530
What-What-What happened?

19:16.530 --> 19:18.699
It's me. I'm the pilot.

19:18.699 --> 19:19.908
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:19.908 --> 19:22.411
You're the brave adventurer I read about?

19:23.954 --> 19:26.790
I used to explore the Outer Rim
for the Jedi.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.626
My mission was to bring b-b-back
what I learned.

19:29.626 --> 19:31.753
How did you end up on this planet?

19:31.753 --> 19:33.881
I didn't make it through
that asteroid field.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.675
Two big asteroids
almost destroyed my ship.

19:37.634 --> 19:41.096
I crash-landed here before I could return
to the Jedi Temple on Tenoo.

19:41.096 --> 19:43.891
- Tenoo?
- Our temple's on the planet Tenoo.

19:43.891 --> 19:47.227
And we can help fix your ship
and complete your mission, OG.

19:47.227 --> 19:51.315
Huh. Actually, I fixed the ship years ago.

19:51.315 --> 19:53.692
Then how come you haven't flown
back to Tenoo?

19:54.651 --> 19:56.445
I'm too afraid to try again.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.906
I-- I'm not a brave adventurer.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.365
Not anymore.

20:04.786 --> 20:06.580
- Poor OG.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.583
There's gotta be something we could do
to help him feel better.

20:09.583 --> 20:11.501
He was a brave adventurer once.

20:11.501 --> 20:13.921
Maybe he just needs some encouragement.

20:14.421 --> 20:15.631
- Come on!

20:27.893 --> 20:33.065
Hey, OG, everyone feels afraid sometimes,
even Jedi.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.735
I was scared
when we went through the asteroid field.

20:37.903 --> 20:39.196
I was.

20:39.196 --> 20:43.200
But then I remembered, Master Zia says
that being brave means facing your fears.

20:43.200 --> 20:47.663
Plus, I have my friends by my side,
and now you have friends by your side.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.666
I am afraid to fly again.

20:50.666 --> 20:55.003
But I will face my fears and be brave,
just like you Jedi.

20:56.088 --> 20:59.424
I will complete my mission
and return to Tenoo.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.550
- Yes!

21:00.550 --> 21:03.011
We'll be there with you the whole way, OG.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.763
Let's tell Nash to meet us here.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.892
So, what's the plan
for getting out of here?

21:08.892 --> 21:10.769
Us three will help OG pilot his ship.

21:10.769 --> 21:15.148
Nash, you fly ahead of us and find
a safe path through the asteroid field.

21:15.148 --> 21:16.233
We'll follow you.

21:19.236 --> 21:22.322
Oh, I am scared to go back
into the asteroid field.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.324
We're here, OG. We'll help you.

21:24.324 --> 21:26.118
And Nash is leading the way.

21:26.118 --> 21:29.955
Stay behind me and RJ,
and we'll get through, no problem.

21:29.955 --> 21:31.373
You got this!

21:34.209 --> 21:35.919
RJ, blast that one.

21:37.212 --> 21:38.422
Oh, thanks, RJ!

21:38.922 --> 21:40.424
Way to fly, OG!

21:42.926 --> 21:43.969
Two asteroids!

21:43.969 --> 21:46.638
This is exactly how I crashed last time.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.141
OG, you've come so far already.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.600
You really are brave.

21:50.600 --> 21:52.352
There has to be a way through there.

21:52.352 --> 21:53.812
You can do it!

21:53.812 --> 21:56.982
Be brave. Be brave.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.859
Be-- [gasps] There!

21:58.859 --> 21:59.943
A way through!

22:00.610 --> 22:02.321
Everybody, hold on to your bolts.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.199
- Whoo-hoo!

22:06.199 --> 22:07.367
Yeah!

22:16.835 --> 22:18.545
You did it!
- Yes!

22:18.545 --> 22:20.088
- Way to go! Yes!

22:20.088 --> 22:22.716
I did it!

22:22.716 --> 22:25.010
I did it! I was brave!

22:30.557 --> 22:34.561
Th-Th-Th-This is the last of the things
I found on my t-t-t-travels.

22:34.561 --> 22:38.065
Jedi will be studying these artifacts
for a long time.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.816
I am delighted to hear that.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.986
Now that I am not afraid to fly,
I must continue my mission.

22:42.986 --> 22:47.282
I visited over 100 worlds,
but the galaxy contains many, many more.

22:47.949 --> 22:52.412
We'll miss you, OG-LC,
but we'll always know where you are.

22:54.498 --> 22:55.957
Come back and visit, will ya?

22:55.957 --> 22:57.709
I would like that very much.

22:59.461 --> 23:00.921
Goodbye, my new Jedi friends.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.881
May the Force be with you.
