BINCKLEYI Brandi!

01:47.482 --> 01:49.943
- He did it again.
- He did?

01:49.985 --> 01:52.487
I tried helping,
but he keeps asking for you.

01:52.571 --> 01:54.740
- Yeah, he does that.
- I want Brandi!

01:55.449 --> 01:56.742
Brandi!

01:58.410 --> 02:00.245
I'm here, Mr. Binckley.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.040
I'm here.

02:03.999 --> 02:06.084
Have we been bad again?

02:07.586 --> 02:09.963
All right. You know what to do.

02:10.505 --> 02:11.798
BINCKLEYI Brandi!

02:13.091 --> 02:15.510
Oh, Mr. Binckley!

02:14.509 --> 02:16.970
- He did it again.
- He did?

02:15.552 --> 02:19.139
- I want Brandi!
- I'm right here, Mr. Binckley.

02:17.012 --> 02:19.514
I tried helping,
but he keeps asking for you.

02:19.181 --> 02:23.018
I'm Brandi. You know I'm Brandi.
I'm right here.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.767
- Yeah, he does that.
- I want Brandi!

02:22.476 --> 02:23.769
Brandi!

02:25.437 --> 02:27.272
I'm here, Mr. Binckley.

02:28.649 --> 02:30.067
I'm here.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.694
- Mr. Binckley's all cleaned up?
- Yes, he's fine.

02:31.026 --> 02:33.111
Have we been bad again?

02:32.778 --> 02:34.780
We're gonna have to talk to his family.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.990
All right. You know what to do.

02:34.863 --> 02:37.282
He is really becoming chronic.

02:37.366 --> 02:40.452
No, you don't have to do that.
I'm more than happy to take care of him.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.537
Oh, Mr. Binckley!

02:40.535 --> 02:41.787
I know you are, Brandi,

02:41.870 --> 02:43.413
but you may not have much time

02:42.579 --> 02:46.166
- I want Brandi!
- I'm right here, Mr. Binckley.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.333
to be spending on cases
like Mr. Binckley anymore.

02:46.208 --> 02:50.045
I'm Brandi. You know I'm Brandi.
I'm right here.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.752
What do you mean, Mrs. Petersen?

02:48.835 --> 02:52.089
I'm considering making you
the new NA Captain.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.383
- The captain of the NAs?
- Yes.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.927
- Would you be interested?
- Yes. Very much.

02:56.551 --> 02:59.721
- Mr. Binckley's all cleaned up?
- Yes, he's fine.

02:57.010 --> 03:00.180
I've watched you with the residents
and with the other nursing assistants

02:59.805 --> 03:01.807
We're gonna have to talk to his family.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.057
and I like what I see.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.309
He is really becoming chronic.

03:03.225 --> 03:05.852
Of course, this is not an official offer,

03:04.393 --> 03:07.479
No, you don't have to do that.
I'm more than happy to take care of him.

03:05.894 --> 03:10.399
but I wanted you to be aware you
are high on my list of possible captains.

03:07.562 --> 03:08.814
I know you are, Brandi,

03:08.897 --> 03:10.440
but you may not have much time

03:10.482 --> 03:13.819
Thank you, Mrs. Petersen.
I'll really try to do my best.

03:10.524 --> 03:13.360
to be spending on cases
like Mr. Binckley anymore.

03:13.652 --> 03:15.779
What do you mean, Mrs. Petersen?

03:13.902 --> 03:15.237
I know you will.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.823
Then I can count on you
coming in tomorrow?

03:15.862 --> 03:19.116
I'm considering making you
the new NA Captain.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.827
- Uh, Saturday?
- I know what day it is, Brandi.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.410
- The captain of the NAs?
- Yes.

03:21.451 --> 03:23.954
- Would you be interested?
- Yes. Very much.

03:21.952 --> 03:24.037
Yes, of course, I know you do,

03:24.037 --> 03:27.207
I've watched you with the residents
and with the other nursing assistants

03:24.079 --> 03:27.207
but I came in last Saturday.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.084
and I like what I see.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.334
Oh, I see.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.879
Of course, this is not an official offer,

03:30.252 --> 03:34.423
But, no, no, no. I can come in. It's fine.
It's no problem.

03:32.921 --> 03:37.426
but I wanted you to be aware you
are high on my list of possible captains.

03:35.590 --> 03:38.552
Good, that's what I'm looking for.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.846
Thank you, Mrs. Petersen.
I'll really try to do my best.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.805
Now, don't let me keep you.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.264
I know you will.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.850
Then I can count on you
coming in tomorrow?

03:42.597 --> 03:45.726
Thank you, Mrs. Petersen. Thank you a lot.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.854
- Uh, Saturday?
- I know what day it is, Brandi.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.064
Yes, of course, I know you do,

03:50.981 --> 03:52.774
I'm just doing my job.

03:51.106 --> 03:54.234
but I came in last Saturday.

03:52.816 --> 03:56.611
And I'm just asking for another week.
A couple of days even?

03:54.276 --> 03:56.361
Oh, I see.

03:56.695 --> 03:58.447
This ain't a charity ward.

03:57.279 --> 04:01.450
But, no, no, no. I can come in. It's fine.
It's no problem.

03:58.488 --> 04:01.158
Just another day. I've got a job interview.

04:01.241 --> 04:03.827
You vacate or I call the cops. Your choice.

04:02.617 --> 04:05.579
Good, that's what I'm looking for.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.287
My choice?

04:05.620 --> 04:08.832
Now, don't let me keep you.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.500
What are you doing?

04:09.624 --> 04:12.753
Thank you, Mrs. Petersen. Thank you a lot.

04:10.959 --> 04:12.252
Making my choice.

04:12.294 --> 04:14.337
Uh-uh. You don't take anything.

04:15.464 --> 04:16.505
What?

04:16.589 --> 04:18.675
You pay or your stuff stays.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.801
I'm just doing my job.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.970
Listen, I've got a job interview.

04:19.843 --> 04:23.638
And I'm just asking for another week.
A couple of days even?

04:22.053 --> 04:24.306
Can't I at least get my good clothes?

04:23.722 --> 04:25.474
This ain't a charity ward.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.185
Just another day. I've got a job interview.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.934
All right, all right, go ahead. I'll wait.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.978
- You'll wait?
- I'll wait.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.854
You vacate or I call the cops. Your choice.

04:30.937 --> 04:32.314
My choice?

04:36.067 --> 04:37.527
What are you doing?

04:37.986 --> 04:39.279
Making my choice.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.364
Uh-uh. You don't take anything.

04:42.491 --> 04:43.533
What?

04:43.617 --> 04:45.702
You pay or your stuff stays.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.997
Listen, I've got a job interview.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.333
Can't I at least get my good clothes?

04:52.834 --> 04:54.961
All right, all right, go ahead. I'll wait.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.005
- You'll wait?
- I'll wait.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.637
I'll be right back.

05:03.678 --> 05:04.805

06:17.252 --> 06:20.589
Why don't you watch
where the fuck you're going, you asshole?

06:20.338 --> 06:21.673
Fuck it.

06:33.935 --> 06:34.936
Hi.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.940
Please, spare change?

06:37.939 --> 06:41.484
Sorry about this. Couldn't get my suitcase
and get here on time.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.195
Jesus!

06:43.945 --> 06:47.365
I'm Thomas Bardo.
I have a 1:00 appointment.

06:44.279 --> 06:47.616
Why don't you watch
where the fuck you're going, you asshole?

06:47.449 --> 06:50.201
Take a seat. Keep all that on your person.

06:51.703 --> 06:52.954
A seat?

06:53.914 --> 06:56.917
- But I have an appointment.
- Take a seat.

06:56.958 --> 07:01.588
But I have a 1:00 appointment
and it's 1:00 now. I was almost late.

07:00.962 --> 07:01.963
Hi.

07:01.630 --> 07:05.300
Sir, I don't want to have to
tell you again. Take a seat.

07:04.966 --> 07:08.511
Sorry about this. Couldn't get my suitcase

07:08.011 --> 07:09.846
- But I have...
- Sir?

07:10.972 --> 07:14.392
I'm Thomas Bardo.
I have a 1:00 appointment.

07:12.641 --> 07:16.311
All right, thank you. I'll take a seat.
Thank you.

07:14.476 --> 07:17.228
Take a seat. Keep all that on your person.

07:16.394 --> 07:18.021
Keep all that on your person.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.440
I will, of course. Thank you.

07:18.730 --> 07:19.981
A seat?

07:20.941 --> 07:23.944
- But I have an appointment.
- Take a seat.

07:23.985 --> 07:28.615
But I have a 1:00 appointment
and it's 1:00 now. I was almost late.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.467
I will, of course. Thank you.

08:05.443 --> 08:08.613
Bradeau. Thomas Bradeau?

08:08.697 --> 08:11.408
<i>Bards. Thomas Bards.</i>

08:12.575 --> 08:13.785
This way.

08:20.250 --> 08:21.459
Take a seat.

08:21.543 --> 08:25.964
Hi, I'm Thomas Bardo.
Sorry about the clothes.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.799
And how do you spell your name?

08:27.882 --> 08:29.759
B-A-R-D-O.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.640
Bradeau. Thomas Bradeau?

08:33.221 --> 08:36.683
Yeah, you'll probably see
that I was a project manager.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.434
<i>Bards. Thomas Bards.</i>

08:36.725 --> 08:38.809
Very challenging job,

08:38.893 --> 08:42.230
but my company decided to downsize
just before my benefits kicked in.

08:39.602 --> 08:40.812
This way.

08:42.313 --> 08:44.065
You know how that is.

08:44.107 --> 08:45.942
Then the unemployment ran out.

08:46.026 --> 08:50.989
I thought I might have better luck in
the city, but... You know how that goes.

08:47.277 --> 08:48.486
Take a seat.

08:48.570 --> 08:52.991
Hi, I'm Thomas Bardo.
Sorry about the clothes.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.326
You know,
I can't seem to find you in the computer.

08:53.074 --> 08:54.826
And how do you spell your name?

08:54.909 --> 08:56.786
B-A-R-D-O.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.746
Oh?

08:59.247 --> 09:02.250
All right, you take that, fill it out,
and mail it in.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.710
Yeah, you'll probably see
that I was a project manager.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.837
Very challenging job,

09:04.544 --> 09:06.421
I've already filled this out.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.257
but my company decided to downsize
just before my benefits kicked in.

09:07.088 --> 09:10.550
Well, you can't be in the computer
until you fill it out and mail it in.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.092
You know how that is.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.969
Then the unemployment ran out.

09:11.134 --> 09:14.846
But I've already mailed this in.
That's how I got the appointment.

09:13.053 --> 09:18.016
I thought I might have better luck in
the city, but... You know how that goes.

09:14.929 --> 09:18.183
Well, you can't have an appointment
until you're in the computer.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.310
But I have an appointment, it was at 1:00,

09:19.100 --> 09:22.353
You know,
I can't seem to find you in the computer.

09:20.393 --> 09:23.605
and I've been waiting
for three and a half hours.

09:23.605 --> 09:24.773
Oh?

09:24.981 --> 09:26.983
But you're not in the computer.

09:26.274 --> 09:29.277
All right, you take that, fill it out,
and mail it in.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.195
-Butâ€œ
-You're not in the computer.

09:30.278 --> 09:35.116
So you fill out the 976,
you mail it in to me

09:31.571 --> 09:33.448
I've already filled this out.

09:34.115 --> 09:37.577
Well, you can't be in the computer
until you fill it out and mail it in.

09:35.950 --> 09:37.702
and I will make sure
you get an appointment.

09:38.161 --> 09:41.873
But I've already mailed this in.
That's how I got the appointment.

09:38.286 --> 09:43.124
Look, Mr. Lieber, this hasn't been
a good day for me, you know.

09:41.956 --> 09:45.210
Well, you can't have an appointment
until you're in the computer.

09:43.458 --> 09:48.379
Can't you just take my word that I've
already sent this in or put me in now...

09:45.293 --> 09:47.337
But I have an appointment, it was at 1:00,

09:47.420 --> 09:50.632
and I've been waiting
for three and a half hours.

09:48.463 --> 09:52.550
Sir, look, if you're willing
to follow procedures, we can work with you.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.010
But you're not in the computer.

09:52.634 --> 09:53.885
If not...

09:54.427 --> 09:57.222
-Butâ€œ
-You're not in the computer.

09:55.386 --> 09:57.138
It's your choice.

09:57.305 --> 10:02.143
So you fill out the 976,
you mail it in to me

10:00.308 --> 10:02.852
Well,
I guess I'd better fill this out, huh?

10:02.977 --> 10:04.729
and I will make sure
you get an appointment.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.064
That's the procedure.

10:05.313 --> 10:10.151
Look, Mr. Lieber, this hasn't been
a good day for me, you know.

10:10.485 --> 10:15.406
Can't you just take my word that I've
already sent this in or put me in now...

10:15.490 --> 10:19.577
Sir, look, if you're willing
to follow procedures, we can work with you.

10:19.661 --> 10:20.912
If not...

10:22.413 --> 10:24.165
It's your choice.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.879
Well,
I guess I'd better fill this out, huh?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.713
Hey, girl.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.091
That's the procedure.

10:32.423 --> 10:33.925
Hey.

10:34.008 --> 10:36.511
- What are you so happy about?
- HAPPY?

10:36.553 --> 10:39.472
Yeah, you look like the cat
that got the canary.

10:39.514 --> 10:41.182
I got some possible good news.

10:41.266 --> 10:44.060
Oh, yeah? What?
I could use some right about now.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.856
- I don't want to say.
- Why not?

10:47.897 --> 10:49.190
I don't want to jinx it.

10:49.274 --> 10:50.775
- Jinx it?
- Yeah.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.197
I'll let you know.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.740
Hey, girl.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.509
Whatever, girl.
You going to HighLow tonight?

10:58.533 --> 11:01.703
- Yeah, of course.
- That's what I'm talking about. T.G.I.F.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.952
Hey.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.538
- What are you so happy about?
- HAPPY?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.788
- Except I've got to work tomorrow.
- You do?

11:03.580 --> 11:06.499
Yeah, you look like the cat
that got the canary.

11:03.872 --> 11:04.873
- Yeah.
- Why?

11:04.914 --> 11:06.374
Petersen needed someone.

11:06.457 --> 11:09.377
Oh, my God. Christ, girl,
you're gonna make us all look bad.

11:06.541 --> 11:08.209
I got some possible good news.

11:08.293 --> 11:11.087
Oh, yeah? What?
I could use some right about now.

11:09.460 --> 11:13.423
You should just tell Petersen that she needs
to get her fat ass in here and she needs...

11:11.880 --> 11:14.883
- I don't want to say.
- Why not?

11:13.506 --> 11:14.549
Oh, my...

11:14.924 --> 11:16.217
I don't want to jinx it.

11:15.967 --> 11:18.553
- See you tomorrow, then?
- Yes. Yes.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.802
- Jinx it?
- Yeah.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.722
And, um, Tanya?

11:20.763 --> 11:22.974
I will be coming in on Saturday.

11:21.806 --> 11:23.224
I'll let you know.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.475
Oh! Um...

11:23.808 --> 11:25.536
Whatever, girl.
You going to HighLow tonight?

11:25.059 --> 11:27.228
Are you needing anyone to work tomorrow?

11:25.560 --> 11:28.730
- Yeah, of course.
- That's what I'm talking about. T.G.I.F.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.022
As a matter of fact, I do.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.815
- Except I've got to work tomorrow.
- You do?

11:29.063 --> 11:32.233
- Should I put you down for tomorrow?
- Sure.

11:30.899 --> 11:31.900
- Yeah.
- Why?

11:31.941 --> 11:33.401
Petersen needed someone.

11:32.984 --> 11:36.321
Fine. We'll see you both tomorrow, then.

11:33.484 --> 11:36.404
Oh, my God. Christ, girl,
you're gonna make us all look bad.

11:36.487 --> 11:40.450
You should just tell Petersen that she needs
to get her fat ass in here and she needs...

11:37.989 --> 11:42.076
- Oh, my God.
- You're busted. You're busted.

11:40.533 --> 11:41.576
Oh, my...

11:42.160 --> 11:43.786
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Mmm-hmm.

11:42.994 --> 11:45.580
- See you tomorrow, then?
- Yes. Yes.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.749
And, um, Tanya?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.708
She's like a fucking ghost!

11:47.790 --> 11:50.001
I will be coming in on Saturday.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.252
- I can't believe you said that.
- Oh, my God.

11:50.084 --> 11:51.502
Oh! Um...

11:51.294 --> 11:52.587
Shit, man.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.255
Are you needing anyone to work tomorrow?

11:53.838 --> 11:56.317
- You think Rashid's gonna be there tonight?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:54.297 --> 11:56.049
As a matter of fact, I do.

11:56.090 --> 11:59.260
- Should I put you down for tomorrow?
- Sure.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.635
Do you think he's gonna have any good X?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.553
He's Rashid.

12:00.011 --> 12:03.348
Fine. We'll see you both tomorrow, then.

12:00.595 --> 12:05.141
Cool, man, because I could really use
some tonight, girl. I really, really could.

12:05.016 --> 12:09.103
- Oh, my God.
- You're busted. You're busted.

12:09.187 --> 12:10.813
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Mmm-hmm.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.735
She's like a fucking ghost!

12:15.777 --> 12:18.279
- I can't believe you said that.
- Oh, my God.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.614
Shit, man.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.344
- You think Rashid's gonna be there tonight?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.662
Do you think he's gonna have any good X?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.580
He's Rashid.

12:27.622 --> 12:32.168
Cool, man, because I could really use
some tonight, girl. I really, really could.

13:40.403 --> 13:43.948
Don't know whether to ask you for money
or give you some.

13:45.408 --> 13:48.870
After the day I've had,
I'll take whatever I can get.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.374
I got just what you need.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.845
- What is it?
- Hey.

14:05.887 --> 14:09.349
You letting the spirits escape.
Drink it. Drink it.

14:07.430 --> 14:10.975
Don't know whether to ask you for money
or give you some.

14:12.435 --> 14:15.897
After the day I've had,
I'll take whatever I can get.

14:14.562 --> 14:17.815
- Jesus.
- Drink some more. Drink some more.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.401
I got just what you need.

14:20.401 --> 14:22.487
Yeah, that's the way.

14:22.570 --> 14:24.572
Show the spirits you mean it!

14:25.406 --> 14:26.574
That's some stuff.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.159
That's what she said.

14:31.287 --> 14:32.872
- What is it?
- Hey.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.708
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.

14:32.914 --> 14:36.376
You letting the spirits escape.
Drink it. Drink it.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.251
And thank you.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.461

14:38.961 --> 14:40.797
The man's called Sam.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.842
- Jesus.

14:41.964 --> 14:45.802

You, too.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.514
Yeah, that's the way.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.599
Show the spirits you mean it!

14:49.597 --> 14:52.141
Are you thinking about
staying here tonight?

14:52.433 --> 14:53.601
That's some stuff.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.352
Well, thinking about it.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.186
That's what she said.

14:54.435 --> 14:59.023
Be careful because a lot of cops come here.
There's a donut shop down there.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.735
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.360
Hey, I ain't shitting you, man.

15:02.443 --> 15:05.613
Fatboys Donuts

And thank you.

15:04.445 --> 15:05.488
Sam.

15:05.655 --> 15:08.282
Forget about your kiss-ass creams
and all that shit.

15:05.988 --> 15:07.824
The man's called Sam.

15:08.366 --> 15:12.036
Fatboys is the place for the best,
and cops know it.

15:08.991 --> 15:12.829
- Tom.
- Good to know you. Good to know you.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.288
You, too.

15:12.954 --> 15:15.289
Okay, Sam, thanks for the info.

15:15.373 --> 15:18.042
- Another drink?
- No, thanks. No, thanks.

15:16.624 --> 15:19.168
Are you thinking about
staying here tonight?

15:18.126 --> 15:19.502
Hey, nice lining.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.379
Well, thinking about it.

15:20.837 --> 15:22.630
- Pardon me?
- Lining.

15:21.462 --> 15:26.050
Be careful because a lot of cops come here.
There's a donut shop down there.

15:24.966 --> 15:26.801
Plaid's my favorite color.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.387
Hey, I ain't shitting you, man.

Fatboys is the place for the best,
and cops know it.

15:37.228 --> 15:39.689
- You need wheels.
- Wheels?

15:39.981 --> 15:42.316
Okay, Sam, thanks for the info.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.825
- All yours.
- You don't have to.

15:50.867 --> 15:54.954
One thing I've learned is never say no
to something free,

15:51.993 --> 15:53.828
Plaid's my favorite color.

15:54.996 --> 16:00.084
which ain't all that hard
because nothing's ever really free, right?

15:58.666 --> 15:59.834
Yeah.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.256
- I'll see you later.

- You don't have to.

16:17.518 --> 16:18.728
Okay.

16:17.894 --> 16:21.981
One thing I've learned is never say no
to something free,

16:22.023 --> 16:27.111
which ain't all that hard
because nothing's ever really free, right?

16:29.697 --> 16:32.283
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

16:35.328 --> 16:36.996
- You have a good time.

Excuse me, baby.
I need to talk to your guy. Yeah.

Listen, where's my money? My money?

16:56.182 --> 16:58.392
Rashid! Over here.

17:00.895 --> 17:03.397

Thank you.

Cheers.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.276
Look at you.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.156
Hello.

17:12.198 --> 17:14.659
Hey, how you doing? Everything all right?

17:13.907 --> 17:16.243
Hey, Tanya. How are you doing?

17:16.117 --> 17:19.079
Excuse me, baby.
I need to talk to your guy. Yeah.

17:16.327 --> 17:18.246
I could be doing a lot better.

17:18.746 --> 17:20.455
That's what I'm here for.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.707
Listen, where's my money? My money?

17:22.833 --> 17:25.586
I think I'm gonna be doing a lot better
in a little while.

17:23.209 --> 17:25.419
Rashid! Over here.

17:25.670 --> 17:28.256
Baby, open wide and trust me.

17:27.922 --> 17:30.424
You better make sure you're easy to find.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.303
Look at you.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.514
Park's closed.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.393
- You can't sleep here.
- Yeah.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.184
Hello.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.271
Hey, Tanya. How are you doing?

17:43.312 --> 17:46.023
There's nobody around here.

17:43.354 --> 17:45.273
I could be doing a lot better.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.483
That's what I'm here for.

17:46.983 --> 17:49.277
I'm not doing anybody any harm.

17:49.360 --> 17:52.196
- Try the Mission.
- The Mission?

17:49.860 --> 17:52.613
I think I'm gonna be doing a lot better
in a little while.

17:52.280 --> 17:53.781
On Hope Street.

17:52.697 --> 17:55.283
Baby, open wide and trust me.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.867
Hope Street? But that's far.

17:56.951 --> 17:59.912
That's right. Come on.

17:59.954 --> 18:02.957
Either that or I take you in, your choice.

18:02.290 --> 18:03.541
Park's closed.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.420
- You can't sleep here.
- Yeah.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.050
There's nobody around here.

18:14.010 --> 18:16.304
I'm not doing anybody any harm.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.596
Hey, don't forget your cart.

18:16.387 --> 18:19.223
- Try the Mission.
- The Mission?

18:19.307 --> 18:20.808
On Hope Street.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.894
Hope Street? But that's far.

18:23.978 --> 18:26.939
That's right. Come on.

18:26.981 --> 18:29.984
Either that or I take you in, your choice.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.371

18:41.621 --> 18:43.623
Hey, don't forget your cart.

18:42.455 --> 18:45.416
- You want to ride with me?
- No.

18:46.167 --> 18:48.502
This cold air is waking me up.

18:50.046 --> 18:52.423
Let's just get back to my place.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.884
- You got anything to drink at your place?
- Mmm...

18:55.760 --> 18:57.261
I got a couple of beers.

18:58.721 --> 19:01.349
I'm gonna stop
and pick something up. Okay?

19:01.432 --> 19:02.850
All right.

19:07.188 --> 19:09.398
- You okay?
- Yeah.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.443
- You want to ride with me?
- No.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.529
This cold air is waking me up.

19:17.073 --> 19:19.450
Let's just get back to my place.

19:19.533 --> 19:21.911

- Mmm...

19:22.787 --> 19:24.288
I got a couple of beers.

19:25.748 --> 19:28.376
I'm gonna stop
and pick something up. Okay?

19:28.459 --> 19:29.877
All right.

19:30.336 --> 19:31.671
Come on, start.

19:50.981 --> 19:52.191
Hey!

19:52.233 --> 19:53.818
- Sorry!
- Hey, what's your problem?

19:53.901 --> 19:55.111
Oh, baby.

19:57.363 --> 19:58.698
Come on, start.

20:05.121 --> 20:06.288
Shit.

20:07.498 --> 20:09.667
Should have let him take me in.

20:10.501 --> 20:13.003
Be some place to fucking stay.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.218
Hey!

20:19.260 --> 20:20.845
- Sorry!
- Hey, what's your problem?

20:20.928 --> 20:22.138
Oh, baby.

So, where do you work again?

40:11.701 --> 40:13.119
- I want Brandi.
- I'm right here.

40:13.161 --> 40:15.121
Do we have to go potty?

40:15.204 --> 40:17.081
- Brandi?
- Brandi.

40:17.123 --> 40:19.125
Gloria will take Mr. Binckley.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.252
- But...
- I'd like to talk to you.

40:23.046 --> 40:24.130
Brandi?

40:24.213 --> 40:27.300
Brandi is busy. Do we have to go poo-poo?

40:27.383 --> 40:28.843
Walk with me.

40:31.220 --> 40:32.472
Mr. Binckley.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.474
- This just won't do.
- I'm sorry?

40:33.723 --> 40:35.642
Come on. I got you.

40:34.557 --> 40:36.100
You know I'd like to promote you.

40:35.725 --> 40:38.645
- Where's Brandi?
- I'm right here. I'm Brandi.

40:36.142 --> 40:38.454
- I'd like to give you more responsibilities.
- I want Brandi!

40:38.478 --> 40:43.066
Yes, of course, and I look forward to it. I
really do, Mrs. Petersen. I'm grateful for it.

40:38.728 --> 40:40.146
- I want Brandi.
- I'm right here.

40:40.188 --> 40:42.148
Do we have to go potty?

40:42.231 --> 40:44.108
- Brandi?
- Brandi.

40:43.149 --> 40:46.319
- Then this just won't do, will it?
- I'm sorry.

40:44.150 --> 40:46.152
Gloria will take Mr. Binckley.

40:46.235 --> 40:48.279
- But...
- I'd like to talk to you.

40:46.402 --> 40:51.157
I can't have my NA captain coming in late,
even on the weekends. It just won't do.

40:50.073 --> 40:51.157
Brandi?

40:51.240 --> 40:54.327
Brandi is busy. Do we have to go poo-poo?

40:51.282 --> 40:53.826
- I agree. I agree.
- You agree?

40:53.910 --> 40:56.287
- Yes.
- But you were almost an hour late.

40:54.410 --> 40:55.870
Walk with me.

40:56.913 --> 40:59.082
Well, because of my car. Um...

40:59.666 --> 41:01.501
- This just won't do.
- I'm sorry?

41:00.083 --> 41:02.043
- I'm having problems with my car.
- Your car?

41:01.584 --> 41:03.127
You know I'd like to promote you.

41:02.126 --> 41:05.755
Yeah, it's been acting up lately
and I had to take a cab.

41:03.169 --> 41:05.481
- I'd like to give you more responsibilities.
- I want Brandi!

41:05.505 --> 41:10.093
Yes, of course, and I look forward to it. I
really do, Mrs. Petersen. I'm grateful for it.

41:05.838 --> 41:08.238
- I'm really not near any bus stops.
- You could have called.

41:08.299 --> 41:11.636
If you want more responsibilities,
you need to stay on top of things.

41:10.176 --> 41:13.346
- Then this just won't do, will it?
- I'm sorry.

41:11.678 --> 41:13.179
Yes, I agree.

41:13.429 --> 41:18.184
I can't have my NA captain coming in late,
even on the weekends. It just won't do.

41:14.347 --> 41:15.723
But you didn't.

41:15.848 --> 41:17.725
- I didn't?
- Call.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.394
You didn't call.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.853
- I agree. I agree.
- You agree?

41:20.144 --> 41:21.688
Are you all right?

41:20.937 --> 41:23.314
- Yes.
- But you were almost an hour late.

41:21.771 --> 41:24.023
Yes! Yes, I'm fine.

41:23.940 --> 41:26.109
Well, because of my car. Um...

41:24.065 --> 41:26.734
I had to wait outside for a cab.

41:26.818 --> 41:29.570
- I know that's really not an excuse...
- Don't you have a cell?

41:27.110 --> 41:29.070
- I'm having problems with my car.
- Your car?

41:29.153 --> 41:32.782
Yeah, it's been acting up lately
and I had to take a cab.

41:30.655 --> 41:33.032
- A cell phone?
- Yes, of course.

41:32.865 --> 41:35.265
- I'm really not near any bus stops.
- You could have called.

41:33.116 --> 41:36.327
If you have a cell phone,
why didn't you use it?

41:35.326 --> 41:38.663
If you want more responsibilities,
you need to stay on top of things.

41:36.411 --> 41:37.620
Um...

41:38.705 --> 41:40.206
Yes, I agree.

41:39.872 --> 41:41.874
My God, I left it in my car.

41:41.374 --> 41:42.750
But you didn't.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.752
- I didn't?
- Call.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.421
You didn't call.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.715
Are you all right?

41:48.798 --> 41:51.050
Yes! Yes, I'm fine.

41:51.092 --> 41:53.761
I had to wait outside for a cab.

41:53.845 --> 41:56.597
- I know that's really not an excuse...
- Don't you have a cell?

41:57.682 --> 42:00.059
- A cell phone?
- Yes, of course.

42:00.143 --> 42:03.354
If you have a cell phone,
why didn't you use it?

42:03.438 --> 42:04.647
Um...

42:06.899 --> 42:08.901
My God, I left it in my car.

42:07.025 --> 42:08.985
- Gloria, have you seen Tanya?
- Tanya?

42:09.068 --> 42:11.529
- Yeah, I need to see her.
- Yeah, I just saw her.

42:11.571 --> 42:13.239
I think she's with Mrs. Pashkowitz.

42:13.322 --> 42:15.033
- Mrs. Pashkowitz?
- Yeah.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.284
Where?

42:17.285 --> 42:20.663
- Are you okay?
- Of course, yes.

42:20.747 --> 42:24.167
- You don't look good.
- No. It, um...

42:24.250 --> 42:26.294
Mrs. Petersen wanted me
to tell Tanya something

42:26.377 --> 42:28.504
and I forgot and it's important.

42:28.588 --> 42:31.007
Well, like I said,
I think she's with Mrs. Pashkowitz.

42:31.090 --> 42:33.217
- In her room?
- Yeah.

42:33.259 --> 42:35.053
- Where is that again?
- Upstairs.

42:34.052 --> 42:36.012
- Gloria, have you seen Tanya?
- Tanya?

42:35.094 --> 42:36.262
Thanks.

42:36.095 --> 42:38.556
- Yeah, I need to see her.
- Yeah, I just saw her.

42:38.598 --> 42:40.266
I think she's with Mrs. Pashkowitz.

42:40.349 --> 42:42.060
- Mrs. Pashkowitz?
- Yeah.

42:42.101 --> 42:43.311
Where?

42:44.312 --> 42:47.690
- Are you okay?
- Of course, yes.

42:47.774 --> 42:51.194
- You don't look good.
- No. It, um...

42:51.277 --> 42:53.321
Mrs. Petersen wanted me
to tell Tanya something

42:53.404 --> 42:55.531
and I forgot and it's important.

42:55.615 --> 42:58.034
Well, like I said,
I think she's with Mrs. Pashkowitz.

42:58.117 --> 43:00.244
- In her room?
- Yeah.

43:00.286 --> 43:02.080
- Where is that again?
- Upstairs.

43:02.121 --> 43:03.289
Thanks.

43:27.396 --> 43:28.815
Oh, God.

43:54.423 --> 43:55.842
Oh, God.

44:30.209 --> 44:32.211
Now this should stop
that sock ripping incident

44:32.295 --> 44:33.921
shouldn't it, Mrs. Pashkowitz? Huh?

44:34.005 --> 44:35.006
Tanya!

44:36.132 --> 44:38.134
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ, Brandi!

44:38.217 --> 44:39.343
Mrs. Pashkowitz.

44:39.385 --> 44:41.554
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.

44:41.596 --> 44:42.722
Are you okay?

44:42.763 --> 44:46.475
No, I'm not okay.
You just cut me, you silly stupid girl.

44:46.559 --> 44:48.394
I'm really, really sorry.

44:48.477 --> 44:49.687
Oh, you're really sorry.

44:49.729 --> 44:52.064
Sorry is not going to stop the bleeding,
is it?

44:52.106 --> 44:56.068
I could get an infection. I could
lose my toe. People my age lose toes.

44:56.152 --> 44:58.905
No, no, no, you're not gonna lose your toe.
It's just a little nick.

44:57.236 --> 44:59.238
Now this should stop
that sock ripping incident

44:58.988 --> 45:01.866
Look, missy,
whose toe are we talking about?

44:59.322 --> 45:00.948
shouldn't it, Mrs. Pashkowitz? Huh?

45:01.032 --> 45:02.033
Tanya!

45:02.241 --> 45:04.386
I'm gonna go get a band-aid
and something to clean it up.

45:03.159 --> 45:05.161
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ, Brandi!

45:04.410 --> 45:06.579
You just stay right there.

45:05.244 --> 45:06.370
Mrs. Pashkowitz.

45:06.412 --> 45:08.581
- Is she okay?
- I don't know.

45:06.662 --> 45:09.081
Be sure to take your sweet time about it.

45:08.623 --> 45:09.749
Are you okay?

45:09.123 --> 45:12.251
Don't worry about me
bleeding to death in here!

45:09.790 --> 45:13.502
No, I'm not okay.
You just cut me, you silly stupid girl.

45:12.293 --> 45:14.086
Where do they get these people?

45:13.586 --> 45:15.421
I'm really, really sorry.

45:14.795 --> 45:16.481
Why the hell
did you sneak up on me like that?

45:15.504 --> 45:16.714
Oh, you're really sorry.

45:16.505 --> 45:17.924
I didn't mean to.

45:16.756 --> 45:19.091
Sorry is not going to stop the bleeding,
is it?

45:17.965 --> 45:19.926
- I need a favor.
- A favor?

45:19.133 --> 45:23.095
I could get an infection. I could
lose my toe. People my age lose toes.

45:20.009 --> 45:22.720
Yeah. Can you cover for me?
I gotta take care of something.

45:22.762 --> 45:24.680
- What?
- It's at home.

45:23.179 --> 45:25.932
No, no, no, you're not gonna lose your toe.
It's just a little nick.

45:24.764 --> 45:27.516
- So tell Petersen.
- I can't. I'm already in hot water with her.

45:26.015 --> 45:28.893
Look, missy,
whose toe are we talking about?

45:27.600 --> 45:28.809
Yeah, and I'm not?

45:28.893 --> 45:31.604
Come on, just cover for me, all right?
I'll be right back.

45:29.268 --> 45:31.413
I'm gonna go get a band-aid
and something to clean it up.

45:31.437 --> 45:33.606
You just stay right there.

45:31.687 --> 45:33.606
Okay, what do you mean by "cover for you"?

45:33.689 --> 45:36.108
Be sure to take your sweet time about it.

45:33.689 --> 45:35.942
You know, if Petersen asks about me...

45:35.983 --> 45:37.526
Oh, Brandi.

45:36.150 --> 45:39.278
Don't worry about me
bleeding to death in here!

45:38.194 --> 45:39.320
Okay.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.113
Where do they get these people?

45:40.279 --> 45:42.823
- Okay, fine, on one condition.
- What?

45:41.822 --> 45:43.508
Why the hell
did you sneak up on me like that?

45:42.907 --> 45:44.408
- You lend me your car.
- My car?

45:43.532 --> 45:44.951
I didn't mean to.

45:44.450 --> 45:46.619
Jeez, don't shit your pants about it.

45:44.992 --> 45:46.953
- I need a favor.
- A favor?

45:46.661 --> 45:49.622
Yeah, it's just that
my car is not running right now.

45:47.036 --> 45:49.747
Yeah. Can you cover for me?
I gotta take care of something.

45:49.705 --> 45:51.374
- There's something wrong with it.
- Oh.

45:49.789 --> 45:51.707
- What?

Okay, okay, baby. Okay, calm down.

Nobody?

58:16.535 --> 58:18.704
Yeah, sure. Sure, baby. Sure, baby.

58:16.868 --> 58:18.078
A customer needed a hit.

58:18.161 --> 58:19.246
- A customer?
- Yeah.

58:19.329 --> 58:21.516
So your customer is fucking you
or are you fucking them?

58:20.163 --> 58:21.873
Help you with what?

58:21.540 --> 58:24.418

58:22.290 --> 58:23.959
It's in my garage.

58:25.127 --> 58:27.063
Why would you even say that?
You know it's only you.

It's in my garage.

59:53.423 --> 59:55.050
What the fuck?

59:56.635 --> 59:58.136
He's the guy I hit.

59:58.637 --> 01:00:00.680
- The homeless guy.
- Yeah.

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:04.601
I thought you said you hit a guy.

01:00:04.643 --> 01:00:06.103
Yeah, he's the guy.

01:00:06.144 --> 01:00:08.748
Yeah, but you didn't say you hit a guy
and brought him home with you.

01:00:08.772 --> 01:00:10.065
Help me.

01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:13.652
Dude, you're still alive?

01:00:13.693 --> 01:00:15.112
Help me.

01:00:15.153 --> 01:00:16.738
This is why I need your help.

01:00:16.822 --> 01:00:18.156
Help me.

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:21.535
This is bullshit, man. Bullshit!

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.077

Get rid of people.

I thought you said you hit a guy.

01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:32.170
Oh, yeah, right.

01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:33.130
Yeah, he's the guy.

01:00:33.171 --> 01:00:35.775
Yeah, but you didn't say you hit a guy
and brought him home with you.

01:00:34.673 --> 01:00:38.802
Here's an idea.
You ever thought of calling 911?

01:00:35.799 --> 01:00:37.092
Help me.

01:00:38.510 --> 01:00:40.679

Look, I don't know what to do with him.
This is why I need your help.

01:00:50.105 --> 01:00:52.941
Look, you said
you could get rid of him, right?

Oh, yeah, right.

I don't do that kind of thing for free,
you know?

01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:05.829
Here's an idea.
You ever thought of calling 911?

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:05.495
- That shit costs.
- Costs?

01:01:05.537 --> 01:01:07.581
Yeah, it's gonna cost big time.

01:01:05.871 --> 01:01:07.706
I can't do that, okay?

01:01:07.664 --> 01:01:08.915
You want me to pay you?

01:01:07.747 --> 01:01:09.916
- They'll know I hit him.
- Yeah.

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:12.586
Hey, baby, I know where you live,
you know what I'm saying?

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.043
I can't do that. This wasn't even my fault.

01:01:12.127 --> 01:01:13.628
- It wasn't?
- No!

01:01:12.669 --> 01:01:15.005
Yeah. Yeah, babe.

01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:18.008
And I know where you live,

You said you could do it.
You said it would be easy.

All the shit you got at your place.
One phone call.

Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's easy. Easy as shit.

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:26.933
What is this, kindergarten?
You gonna tell on me?

01:01:27.017 --> 01:01:28.143
Yeah.

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:30.228
I don't do that kind of thing for free,
you know?

01:01:28.226 --> 01:01:32.272
Yeah, I will. I swear to God I will.
If you don't help me with this, I will.

01:01:30.312 --> 01:01:32.522
- That shit costs.
- Costs?

01:01:32.564 --> 01:01:34.608
Yeah, it's gonna cost big time.

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:34.941
Fuck, man!

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:35.942
You want me to pay you?

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:39.613
Hey, baby, I know where you live,
you know what I'm saying?

01:01:39.029 --> 01:01:41.573
Did he get out of the car?

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:42.032
Yeah. Yeah, babe.

01:01:42.616 --> 01:01:45.035
And I know where you live,
know what I'm saying?

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:44.743
Yeah, I don't know how.

01:01:45.035 --> 01:01:46.328
Oh, shit.

01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:47.078
- Huh?
- Come on, Rashid!

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:49.998
- We'd better tie him up.
- Tie him up?

01:01:47.162 --> 01:01:50.373
All the shit you got at your place.
One phone call.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.960
What is this, kindergarten?
You gonna tell on me?

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:53.501
You don't want him
crawling around everywhere.

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:56.379
- No.
- Then I guess we tie him up! Huh?

01:01:54.044 --> 01:01:55.170
Yeah.

01:01:55.253 --> 01:01:59.299
Yeah, I will. I swear to God I will.
If you don't help me with this, I will.

01:02:00.634 --> 01:02:01.968
Fuck, man!

01:02:02.302 --> 01:02:04.179
I think he passed out.

01:02:05.931 --> 01:02:08.975
Man, this guy is covered with blood
and dirt and crap.

01:02:06.056 --> 01:02:08.600
Did he get out of the car?

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:11.770
Yeah, I don't know how.

01:02:10.477 --> 01:02:11.728
Um...

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:13.355
Oh, shit.

01:02:12.646 --> 01:02:15.065
You got something we can wrap him up in?

01:02:14.064 --> 01:02:17.025
- We'd better tie him up.
- Tie him up?

01:02:15.815 --> 01:02:17.901
I don't know. What?

01:02:17.943 --> 01:02:20.111
I don't know, plastic?

01:02:18.610 --> 01:02:20.528
You don't want him
crawling around everywhere.

01:02:20.612 --> 01:02:23.406
- No.
- Then I guess we tie him up! Huh?

01:02:26.660 --> 01:02:28.119
This guy ain't going nowhere.

01:02:29.287 --> 01:02:31.081
- Oh, shit!
- Are you guys in there?

01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:31.206
I think he passed out.

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:36.002
Man, this guy is covered with blood
and dirt and crap.

01:02:33.124 --> 01:02:34.584
Oh, fuck.

01:02:35.168 --> 01:02:38.463
Oh, my God. Holy shit, man.
What the hell happened?

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:38.755
Um...

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:40.257
- I was in kind of an accident.
- Kind of?

01:02:39.673 --> 01:02:42.092
You got something we can wrap him up in?

01:02:40.298 --> 01:02:41.424
Yeah.

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:42.818
Look, why don't we go in the house, huh?

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:44.928
I don't know. What?

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:44.803
Dude, this looks real bad.

01:02:44.844 --> 01:02:46.280
Yeah, it's kind of fucked up, right?

01:02:44.970 --> 01:02:47.138
I don't know, plastic?

01:02:46.304 --> 01:02:48.640
- Major.
- Come on, let's go in the house.

01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:52.477
Your car, what happened to it?

01:02:53.645 --> 01:02:56.564
- It was an accident.
- I got that. What happened?

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:55.146
This guy ain't going nowhere.

01:02:56.314 --> 01:02:58.108
- Oh, shit!
- Are you guys in there?

01:02:56.648 --> 01:02:58.149
You know what it was?

01:02:59.985 --> 01:03:03.530
What's going on with you two?
What the hell happened to your car?

01:03:00.151 --> 01:03:01.611
Oh, fuck.

01:03:02.195 --> 01:03:05.490
Oh, my God. Holy shit, man.
What the hell happened?

01:03:04.155 --> 01:03:05.407
It was weird.

01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:06.908
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:07.284
- I was in kind of an accident.
- Kind of?

01:03:06.992 --> 01:03:08.803
Just wait inside. Everything is...
Just go inside.

01:03:07.325 --> 01:03:08.451
Yeah.

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:09.845
Look, why don't we go in the house, huh?

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:10.036
Okay.

01:03:09.869 --> 01:03:11.830
Dude, this looks real bad.

01:03:11.871 --> 01:03:13.307
Yeah, it's kind of fucked up, right?

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:15.667
- Major.

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:18.628
So what happened?

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:19.504
Your car, what happened to it?

01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:19.796
Uh...

01:03:20.338 --> 01:03:23.300
- Brandi, you didn't tell her?
- No, I didn't tell her.

01:03:20.672 --> 01:03:23.591
- It was an accident.
- I got that. What happened?

01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:25.176
You know what it was?

01:03:24.509 --> 01:03:25.635
Brandi hit something.

01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:28.013
Well, what? I mean,
there's blood all over the windshield.

01:03:27.012 --> 01:03:30.557
What's going on with you two?
What the hell happened to your car?

01:03:28.096 --> 01:03:29.681
Yeah, I hit something.

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:30.849
A deer.

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:32.434
It was weird.

01:03:31.182 --> 01:03:32.767
A deer?

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:33.935
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:35.478
Yeah, it just came out of nowhere,
didn't it?

01:03:34.019 --> 01:03:35.830
Just wait inside. Everything is...
Just go inside.

01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:37.063
Okay.

01:03:36.521 --> 01:03:39.774
Yeah, it did. Out of nowhere.
Suddenly there it was.

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:41.776
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

01:03:42.444 --> 01:03:45.363
Oh, my God, those goddamn fucking deer.

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:45.655
So what happened?

01:03:45.447 --> 01:03:47.127
- Crazy thing, ain't it?
- Oh, my goodness.

01:03:45.697 --> 01:03:46.823
Uh...

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:51.036
You know, my aunt hit one once,
you know, God.

01:03:47.365 --> 01:03:50.327
- Brandi, you didn't tell her?
- No, I didn't tell her.

01:03:51.119 --> 01:03:53.538
Thank you.
Brandi, you could have been killed.

01:03:51.536 --> 01:03:52.662
Brandi hit something.

01:03:52.704 --> 01:03:55.040
Well, what? I mean,
there's blood all over the windshield.

01:03:53.621 --> 01:03:55.957
- Yeah, it's true.
- Yeah, yeah, I could have.

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:56.708
Yeah, I hit something.

01:03:56.041 --> 01:03:58.001
So why didn't you tell me?

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:57.876
A deer.

01:03:58.209 --> 01:03:59.794
A deer?

01:03:58.501 --> 01:04:01.254
- You mean about the accident?
- Of course.

01:03:59.878 --> 01:04:02.505
Yeah, it just came out of nowhere,
didn't it?

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:03.757
I don't know.
I was just too freaked.

01:04:03.548 --> 01:04:06.801
Yeah, it did. Out of nowhere.
Suddenly there it was.

01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.761
Oh, hon, yeah. I can just imagine.

01:04:06.885 --> 01:04:08.803
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:13.350
I mean, something like this that happens
to you and it's not even your fault.

01:04:09.471 --> 01:04:12.390
Oh, my God, those goddamn fucking deer.

01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:14.154
- Crazy thing, ain't it?
- Oh, my goodness.

01:04:13.391 --> 01:04:15.810
- And you could have been killed.
- Yeah.

01:04:14.225 --> 01:04:18.063
You know, my aunt hit one once,
you know, God.

01:04:16.811 --> 01:04:18.063
You know,

01:04:18.146 --> 01:04:20.565
Thank you.
Brandi, you could have been killed.

01:04:19.064 --> 01:04:20.815
this is some bullshit.

01:04:20.648 --> 01:04:22.984
- Yeah, it's true.
- Yeah, yeah, I could have.

01:04:23.068 --> 01:04:25.028
So why didn't you tell me?

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:28.281
- You mean about the accident?
- Of course.

01:04:28.365 --> 01:04:30.784
I don't know.
I was just too freaked.

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:30.950
So, did you kill him?

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:34.788
Oh, hon, yeah. I can just imagine.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:33.495
- Kill him?
- Yeah, the deer.

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:34.746
Uh...

01:04:35.497 --> 01:04:40.377
I mean, something like this that happens
to you and it's not even your fault.

01:04:37.332 --> 01:04:40.335
She doesn't know.
It kind of crawled away, didn't it?

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:42.837
- And you could have been killed.
- Yeah.

01:04:40.418 --> 01:04:41.920
Yeah, it did.

01:04:42.003 --> 01:04:43.588
Deer can crawl?

01:04:43.838 --> 01:04:45.090
You know,

01:04:44.756 --> 01:04:46.508
Tanya, why are you here?

01:04:46.091 --> 01:04:47.842
this is some bullshit.

01:04:46.591 --> 01:04:47.926
Oh, right.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:52.889
Okay, look, you never came back to work.

01:04:53.431 --> 01:04:56.393
And I tried calling your home
and I tried calling your cell

01:04:56.184 --> 01:04:57.977
So, did you kill him?

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.436
and there was no answer.

01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:00.522
- Kill him?
- Yeah, the deer.

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:03.358
- Petersen knows that you split.
- She does?

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:01.773
Uh...

01:05:03.441 --> 01:05:04.835
Look, I thought you were covering for me.

01:05:04.359 --> 01:05:07.362
She doesn't know.
It kind of crawled away, didn't it?

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:07.237
I tried, but Mr. Binckley
started asking for you

01:05:07.278 --> 01:05:09.256
and then Petersen,
she starts looking around for you,

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:08.947
Yeah, it did.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:10.615
Deer can crawl?

01:05:09.280 --> 01:05:11.366
then she starts asking me and...

01:05:11.449 --> 01:05:12.659
- You know what?
- Fuck.

01:05:11.783 --> 01:05:13.535
Tanya, why are you here?

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.702
- She's really pissed off.
- Fuck.

01:05:13.618 --> 01:05:14.953
Oh, right.

01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:17.747
- But I didn't tell her that you went home.
- Shit!

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:19.916
Okay, look, you never came back to work.

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:20.792
She just knows that you're gone. Sorry.

01:05:20.458 --> 01:05:23.420
And I tried calling your home
and I tried calling your cell

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.796
Yo, Rashid, can you give me a lift?

01:05:23.461 --> 01:05:25.463
and there was no answer.

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:26.631
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:27.882
- Well...
- Come on, man.

01:05:27.465 --> 01:05:30.385
- Petersen knows that you split.
- She does?

01:05:27.966 --> 01:05:30.468
I had to take the fucking bus to get here.
It took me an hour.

01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:31.862
Look, I thought you were covering for me.

01:05:30.552 --> 01:05:33.179
Yeah, but, you know,
we're kind of in the middle of something.

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:34.264
I tried, but Mr. Binckley
started asking for you

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:35.265
You know what I'm saying?

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:36.283
and then Petersen,
she starts looking around for you,

01:05:35.765 --> 01:05:37.058
Oh. Ew.

01:05:36.307 --> 01:05:38.393
then she starts asking me and...

01:05:37.142 --> 01:05:39.644
Okay. Well, do you have any things on you?

01:05:38.476 --> 01:05:39.686
- You know what?
- Fuck.

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:41.729
- She's really pissed off.
- Fuck.

01:05:40.478 --> 01:05:42.105
Yeah, always.

01:05:41.813 --> 01:05:44.774
- But I didn't tell her that you went home.
- Shit!

01:05:44.816 --> 01:05:47.819
She just knows that you're gone. Sorry.

01:05:47.110 --> 01:05:48.611
- Here.
- Whoa.

01:05:48.987 --> 01:05:51.823
Yo, Rashid, can you give me a lift?

01:05:49.487 --> 01:05:51.322
Thank you.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:53.658
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:54.909
- Well...
- Come on, man.

01:05:54.826 --> 01:05:59.330
But, you know,
I don't get paid until next week.

01:05:54.993 --> 01:05:57.495
I had to take the fucking bus to get here.
It took me an hour.

01:05:57.579 --> 01:06:00.206
Yeah, but, you know,
we're kind of in the middle of something.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:02.125
- So you owe me.
- Yeah, I owe you.

01:06:00.290 --> 01:06:02.292
You know what I'm saying?

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.085
Oh. Ew.

01:06:04.169 --> 01:06:06.671
Okay. Well, do you have any things on you?

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:06.671
- Tanya.
- Hmm?

01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:08.298
Bye.

01:06:07.505 --> 01:06:09.132
Yeah, always.

01:06:09.132 --> 01:06:10.175
Oh.

01:06:10.216 --> 01:06:11.676
Okay. Okay.

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:15.638
- Here.
- Whoa.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:18.349
Thank you.

01:06:21.853 --> 01:06:26.357
But, you know,
I don't get paid until next week.

01:06:22.103 --> 01:06:24.481
- Yo, Brandi, you going to work tomorrow?
- No.

01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:27.066
You better come up with something good
for Petersen on Monday.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:29.152
- So you owe me.
- Yeah, I owe you.

01:06:27.150 --> 01:06:29.569
- That bitch is pissed.
- Yeah, you said.

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:33.031
You know what? I just can't
believe that thing about the deer.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:33.698
- Tanya.
- Hmm?

01:06:34.199 --> 01:06:35.325
Bye.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:37.243
What do you mean?

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:37.202
Oh.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:38.703
Okay. Okay.

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:40.747
Oh, man, you are so lucky.
I mean, you really could have been killed.

01:06:40.830 --> 01:06:42.540
- I am lucky.
- Yeah.

01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:44.626
Okay. I'll see you later.

01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:46.377
- All right.
- Bye.

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:51.549
- Fuck! Fuck! God damn it!
- Be cool, baby. Be cool.

01:06:49.130 --> 01:06:51.508
- Yo, Brandi, you going to work tomorrow?
- No.

01:06:51.549 --> 01:06:54.093
You better come up with something good
for Petersen on Monday.

01:06:51.633 --> 01:06:53.051
What the hell are we gonna do?

01:06:53.134 --> 01:06:54.844
- She fucking saw.
- She saw the car.

01:06:54.177 --> 01:06:56.596
- That bitch is pissed.
- Yeah, you said.

01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:57.388
- She didn't see the body, she saw the car.
- Yeah.

01:06:56.679 --> 01:07:00.058
You know what? I just can't
believe that thing about the deer.

01:06:57.472 --> 01:06:59.724
All you have to do is
fix the fucking window.

01:06:59.766 --> 01:07:03.061
Wait a minute.
There's blood on the seats in the car.

01:07:02.936 --> 01:07:04.270
What do you mean?

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:06.022
- Seat covers.
- Seat covers?

01:07:04.354 --> 01:07:07.774
Oh, man, you are so lucky.
I mean, you really could have been killed.

01:07:06.064 --> 01:07:08.191
All we have to do is get rid of him, right?

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.567
- I am lucky.
- Yeah.

01:07:08.233 --> 01:07:09.359
Yeah.

01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:11.903
So we wait till dark,
dump his ass in the park.

01:07:09.609 --> 01:07:11.653
Okay. I'll see you later.

01:07:11.736 --> 01:07:13.404
- All right.
- Bye.

01:07:11.945 --> 01:07:13.255
- What, and that's it?
- That's it.

01:07:13.279 --> 01:07:15.365
Out of sight, out of mind.

01:07:15.406 --> 01:07:18.576
- Fuck! Fuck! God damn it!
- Be cool, baby. Be cool.

01:07:16.032 --> 01:07:19.244
Baby, I've done shit like this
a thousand times. It's no big deal.

01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.078
What the hell are we gonna do?

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:20.703
A thousand times?

01:07:20.161 --> 01:07:21.871
- She fucking saw.
- She saw the car.

01:07:20.745 --> 01:07:24.332
Well, not really a thousand times.
Come on, you know what I mean.

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:24.415
- She didn't see the body, she saw the car.
- Yeah.

01:07:24.499 --> 01:07:26.751
All you have to do is
fix the fucking window.

01:07:24.749 --> 01:07:25.750
Look.

01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:30.964
We chill out for a few hours,
wait till dark, go and do the deed.

01:07:26.793 --> 01:07:30.088
Wait a minute.
There's blood on the seats in the car.

01:07:30.129 --> 01:07:33.049
- Seat covers.
- Seat covers?

01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:34.133
You know what I mean?

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:35.218
All we have to do is get rid of him, right?

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.386
Yeah.

01:07:35.635 --> 01:07:36.761
Okay.

01:07:36.427 --> 01:07:38.930
So we wait till dark,
dump his ass in the park.

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:39.764
Good girl.

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:40.282
- What, and that's it?
- That's it.

01:07:40.306 --> 01:07:42.392
Out of sight, out of mind.

01:07:43.059 --> 01:07:46.271
Baby, I've done shit like this
a thousand times. It's no big deal.

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:46.938
Where are you going, baby girl?

01:07:46.312 --> 01:07:47.730
A thousand times?

01:07:46.980 --> 01:07:49.399
Dog, dog. Princess!

01:07:47.772 --> 01:07:51.359
Well, not really a thousand times.
Come on, you know what I mean.

01:07:51.776 --> 01:07:52.777
Look.

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:53.069
Princess, where are you?

01:07:53.111 --> 01:07:54.612
Princess! Princess!

01:07:53.653 --> 01:07:57.991
We chill out for a few hours,
wait till dark, go and do the deed.

01:07:55.863 --> 01:07:57.156
Princess!

01:07:59.367 --> 01:08:01.160
You know what I mean?

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:03.329
Princess, you come here right now.

01:08:02.662 --> 01:08:03.788
Okay.

01:08:05.456 --> 01:08:06.791
Good girl.

01:08:11.629 --> 01:08:13.965
Where are you going, baby girl?

01:08:14.007 --> 01:08:16.426
Dog, dog. Princess!

01:08:18.886 --> 01:08:20.095
Princess, where are you?

01:08:20.138 --> 01:08:21.639
Princess! Princess!

01:08:22.890 --> 01:08:24.183
Princess!

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:30.356
Princess, you come here right now.

01:08:40.825 --> 01:08:42.118
Princess?

01:08:42.993 --> 01:08:44.287
Princess?

01:08:44.996 --> 01:08:47.122
Princess, where are you? Princess?

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:49.917
Princess, you come here. Princess?

01:08:50.877 --> 01:08:52.377
Princess?

01:08:52.462 --> 01:08:55.631
Princess? There you are.
You naughty, naughty thing, you.

01:08:55.923 --> 01:08:59.719
You're a naughty little baby dog,
aren't you? Aren't you? Yes, you are.

01:09:01.595 --> 01:09:03.930
Help me! Help me, please!

01:09:04.015 --> 01:09:07.602
Yes, you are. You're a naughty little girl.
What's got into you?

01:09:07.852 --> 01:09:09.145
Princess?

01:09:09.354 --> 01:09:10.563
Oh, my God.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:11.314
Princess?

01:09:12.023 --> 01:09:14.149
Princess, where are you? Princess?

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:14.024
Where have you been?

01:09:14.108 --> 01:09:16.694
You've been in the garbage again,
haven't you?

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:16.944
Princess, you come here. Princess?

01:09:16.736 --> 01:09:19.279
Look. Now Daddy's got to go
get us all cleaned up,

01:09:17.904 --> 01:09:19.404
Princess?

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:21.658
you naughty, naughty thing, you.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:22.658
Princess? There you are.
You naughty, naughty thing, you.

01:09:22.450 --> 01:09:26.537
Help me. I need help. Please! Fuck!

01:09:22.950 --> 01:09:26.746
You're a naughty little baby dog,

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:30.957
Help me! Help me, please!

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:34.629
Yes, you are. You're a naughty little girl.
What's got into you?

01:09:35.712 --> 01:09:38.424
- So how are you gonna do it?
- Do what?

01:09:36.381 --> 01:09:37.590
Oh, my God.

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:39.801
Get rid of him.

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:41.051
Where have you been?

01:09:40.635 --> 01:09:42.636
Listen, the guy's not Superman, is he?

01:09:41.135 --> 01:09:43.720
You've been in the garbage again,
haven't you?

01:09:42.720 --> 01:09:44.490
I mean, how much longer
do you think he's gonna live?

01:09:43.763 --> 01:09:46.307
Look. Now Daddy's got to go
get us all cleaned up,

01:09:44.514 --> 01:09:46.474
You fucked him up pretty bad, babe.

01:09:46.390 --> 01:09:48.685
you naughty, naughty thing, you.

01:09:46.557 --> 01:09:47.892
You said you could do it.

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:49.935
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.

01:09:49.477 --> 01:09:53.564
Help me. I need help. Please! Fuck!

01:09:50.019 --> 01:09:52.229
- So then how?
- How?

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:54.541
Yeah, you said you could get rid of him,

01:09:54.565 --> 01:09:56.859
so why can't you tell me
how you're gonna get rid of him?

01:09:56.901 --> 01:09:58.736
You really want to know
how I'm gonna do it?

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.988
- Yes.
- You really want to know?

01:10:01.072 --> 01:10:02.281
That's what I asked you!

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:05.576
