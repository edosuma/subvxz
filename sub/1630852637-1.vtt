WEBVTT

00:49.967 --> 00:54.972
London Bridge is falling down
Falling down

00:55.055 --> 00:57.516
Please don't leave me alone with her.
I want to stay with the Turners.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.686
I will unite this child's soul.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.751
You can't. It's criminal.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.545
It betrays everything you believe in.

03:31.628 --> 03:33.255
He has two teeth, Julian.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.465
He can't chew with two teeth.
This isn't a conversation.

03:35.549 --> 03:38.093
Tell that to the toothless woman
who sleeps outside my office.

03:38.177 --> 03:39.928
I saw her eat a shoe once.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.806
All I'm saying is
we don't wanna limit his potential.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.642
I think I feel a third coming in.

03:45.726 --> 03:48.645
Is someone gonna be fussy today? Yes.

03:48.729 --> 03:51.148
Leanne, tell Julian
how easily babies choke.

03:51.231 --> 03:53.734
When was the last time
you were actually in the office?

03:53.817 --> 03:55.027
Why is the door open?

03:56.069 --> 03:59.198
Sean, no. Stop with the noise.
You're gonna scare him.

03:59.281 --> 04:00.782
What's wrong with your face?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.620
I've been waiting a long time for this.

04:04.703 --> 04:08.290
I think a lot of men feel inadequate
because they can't breastfeed.

04:08.373 --> 04:11.919
Yeah well, at some point, Sean,
you need to do personal inventory. Okay?

04:12.002 --> 04:13.795
Ask yourself,
"Who am I really cooking for?

04:14.421 --> 04:15.672
Jericho or myself?"

04:15.756 --> 04:18.007
You've been to one fucking NA meeting.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.510
I can't stand this much more.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.512
You ready for food, buddy? Nom nom time.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.388
It's a lot,
but we said we'd be supportive…

04:23.472 --> 04:24.473
I can hear you.

04:24.556 --> 04:25.891
Why is the door open?

04:25.974 --> 04:27.226
Everybody, shut up!

04:27.893 --> 04:28.894
It's time.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.567
Oh, Sean.

04:35.651 --> 04:37.694
Look at his lips smacking.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.531
-Like a little Italian baby.
-He loves it.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.866
I knew he had an excellent palette.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.618
-Here you go.
-Quick. Give him another bite.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.245
Look, look, he wants more.

04:49.248 --> 04:50.499
Do you like that?

04:50.582 --> 04:52.960
We can have dinner
on the Shore together tomorrow.

05:01.552 --> 05:02.553
Leanne.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.098
No one is out there.

05:07.474 --> 05:08.600
We looked.

05:09.268 --> 05:10.686
You wouldn't know what to look for.

05:10.769 --> 05:12.479
Those Midwest dead eyes.

05:13.689 --> 05:15.691
It's not my fault all cults look the same.

05:16.191 --> 05:18.819
Put on a pair of sunglasses or something.
Spice it up.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.281
They can slip into your life
without you even noticing.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.408
We should've kept the door closed.

05:24.491 --> 05:27.786
It's been three months
since Aunt Josephine,

05:27.870 --> 05:29.580
who you said isn't coming back.

05:30.831 --> 05:34.334
If the rest were going to come for you,
wouldn't they have done so already?

05:35.669 --> 05:36.837
They're patient.

05:37.421 --> 05:39.173
Maybe we should cancel
the trip to the Shore.

05:39.256 --> 05:40.591
It's gonna be cold anyway.

05:40.674 --> 05:41.967
No. We need air.

05:42.050 --> 05:46.013
We need sunshine.
We need to feel the sand in our shoes.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.556
What if I can't?

05:50.058 --> 05:51.560
Look at Jericho.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.229
He's got a new tooth coming in.

05:55.063 --> 05:56.273
Feel it.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.614
It's sharp.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.577
You're safe, Leanne.

06:09.203 --> 06:11.288
Because if anyone comes for you,

06:11.830 --> 06:14.208
they're gonna have to come
through us first.

06:14.917 --> 06:16.543
Baby teeth and all.

06:19.129 --> 06:20.506
I've never seen the ocean before.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.132
You're gonna love it.

06:22.216 --> 06:23.550
It's Jersey.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.762
When you three go on your walk
this afternoon,

06:26.845 --> 06:29.014
try and really make it
to the park this time.

06:29.556 --> 06:30.807
It's for her own good.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.228
Bet if I left a trail of soup cans,
she'd follow it there.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.812
She'd follow you.

06:35.896 --> 06:38.148
I've seen the little connection
you two have.

06:38.232 --> 06:40.025
Can make a lot of wives jealous.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.109
But not you?

06:41.902 --> 06:42.903
You're too strong.

06:42.986 --> 06:44.863
Jealousy looks ugly on you.

06:44.947 --> 06:46.114
Please, darling.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.367
Nothing looks ugly on me.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.789
Do you remember
the first meal I ever cooked for you?

06:54.706 --> 06:57.626
Bucatini with bottarga.

07:00.838 --> 07:02.548
I'm gonna bring some to the beach.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.174
For Jericho.

07:05.676 --> 07:07.970
Fatherhood's turned you into such a pussy.

07:09.555 --> 07:11.139
I've always been a pussy.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.144
Is Veera coming over tomorrow?

07:16.228 --> 07:17.563
Yeah.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.356
She loves the Shore.

07:19.982 --> 07:22.526
Says it's like being drunk
while staying sober.

07:23.110 --> 07:24.570
Great. I like her.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.530
Yeah, better than Natalie?

07:26.613 --> 07:29.950
Yeah, her popularity took a hit
while dumping me while I was in rehab.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.494
To be fair,
she stuck with you the first two times.

07:32.578 --> 07:33.871
-Yeah.
-Hey, I gotta head out.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.915
So maybe you could take
Jericho and Leanne on their walk?

07:36.999 --> 07:39.585
See if you could get her to the park.
But don't force it, you know?

07:40.961 --> 07:43.088
I was gonna make this a surprise…

07:43.589 --> 07:45.048
but I got you and Dorothy a gift.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.758
You're welcome.

07:46.842 --> 07:49.595
Thank you.
So, can you take them on their walk?

07:50.554 --> 07:51.763
It's a very nice gift, Sean.

07:52.514 --> 07:55.475
Julian, it's essentially
what you're doing right now but outside,

07:55.559 --> 07:57.311
less annoying and actually helpful.

07:57.394 --> 07:59.730
You know it's unhealthy
for me to be around fragile people.

07:59.813 --> 08:02.816
Trust me, if there was anyone else,
I would've asked them first.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.403
-What are you doing that's so precious?
-I've got errands!

08:06.486 --> 08:07.487
Errands?

08:08.071 --> 08:09.364
You cryptic dog.

08:09.448 --> 08:11.200
You're shopping
for a new espresso machine.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.284
Take me with you!

08:35.682 --> 08:36.975
Hi.

08:37.058 --> 08:41.063
So I'm gonna be your companion… escort.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.191
Fuck! I'm gonna go on the walk with you.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.151
Both of you.

08:46.235 --> 08:47.319
Outside.

08:47.402 --> 08:48.445
Yay.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.531
I'll be downstairs.

09:29.528 --> 09:30.779
This is good.

09:30.863 --> 09:32.239
Being outside.

09:32.322 --> 09:33.323
Real people.

09:33.991 --> 09:37.744
So, Leanne, I-- I asked Sean
if I could take you on this walk.

09:37.828 --> 09:43.125
I thought it would be emotionally--
Well, whatever. This walk is bad enough.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.793
Hear this sick puppy out.

09:44.877 --> 09:46.962
We've been having…

09:47.045 --> 09:48.046
Sex?

09:48.130 --> 09:50.674
Yes. And I like that. I like that a lot.

09:51.175 --> 09:55.762
You may have noticed I'm trying
to do things a little bit differently now.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.472
You're trying to be a good person.

09:58.140 --> 10:00.809
Well, I've always tried
to be a good person.

10:00.893 --> 10:02.644
I like it better when you don't try.

10:02.728 --> 10:04.104
Let me clarify.

10:04.188 --> 10:05.647
I feel like the creepy old fuck

10:05.731 --> 10:08.817
who's secretly sleeping with
his sister's traumatized nanny. Yes?

10:08.901 --> 10:10.944
You should be sleeping with
someone your own age.

10:11.028 --> 10:15.782
Someone with abs, defined hairline,
a sparkle in his eye,

10:15.866 --> 10:18.619
that isn't soured
by reality or intelligence.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.913
Your father sees younger women.

10:20.996 --> 10:22.414
My point exactly.

10:22.497 --> 10:25.083
Okay, we found each other
in a dark place--

10:25.876 --> 10:29.505
Two flies fucking
on a sad flaming ball of shit.

10:29.588 --> 10:31.590
-And now it's time I think we--
-No!

10:32.674 --> 10:35.177
I like our sex. It feels good to me.

10:36.136 --> 10:39.056
And I want you to stop trying
to be something that you're not.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.810
Veera's coming to the Shore
with us tomorrow.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.234
Leanne!

10:52.569 --> 10:53.654
Oh, my God.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.449
I'm sorry.

10:58.659 --> 10:59.660
Here.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.232
You know what I am?

11:30.315 --> 11:32.776
I'm not a bear. I'm not a bull.

11:32.860 --> 11:33.902
I'm an eagle.

11:33.986 --> 11:37.573
Flying high, looking for some fresh meat!

11:37.656 --> 11:42.369
So, when they tell me that pork bellies
are down, I don't care!

11:42.452 --> 11:43.662
When they tell me beef is down…

11:43.745 --> 11:46.331
Whatever he says, do the opposite.

11:48.834 --> 11:51.461
You know your dad's gonna
pressure you to be a chef.

11:51.545 --> 11:54.381
And I'm not saying
you shouldn't learn to cook or enjoy it.

11:55.174 --> 11:57.676
Just don't live your life
in his shade, okay?

11:58.260 --> 12:00.971
$75,000 a year!

12:01.555 --> 12:05.475
-What the hell is this?
-Thirty minutes, every day.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.312
Imagine the calves on this family.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.646
Dorothy's gonna kill you.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.107
Where's Leanne?
Did you make it to the park?

12:12.191 --> 12:13.442
Not even close.

12:26.330 --> 12:29.166
After the last contractor
couldn't fill it, I contacted the city.

12:30.334 --> 12:31.793
They're gonna send out a guy.

12:32.419 --> 12:33.670
A geologist or something.

12:34.505 --> 12:37.966
Who knows when that'll happen,
but we're still trying.

12:42.387 --> 12:45.516
I still can't believe we're here.
On the other side of it.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.070
You're gonna see the ocean tomorrow.

12:59.196 --> 13:00.781
You're gonna play in the sand.

13:01.406 --> 13:02.950
Feel it between your toes.

13:03.617 --> 13:04.785
There you go.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.259
I'm sorry. I just put him down.

13:20.342 --> 13:22.010
I'm actually here to see you.

13:28.267 --> 13:31.061
I guessed your size, you twig.

13:31.144 --> 13:35.315
But if it doesn't fit or if you don't
like it, we can always take it back.

13:35.399 --> 13:37.276
Whatever makes you comfortable.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.153
It's not for tomorrow.
It will be far too cold.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.448
But consider it aspirational.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.161
I just thought, maybe you didn't have one.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.165
Thank you, Dorothy.

13:55.419 --> 13:58.172
My mother wouldn't let me
wear a two-piece till I was 15.

13:58.255 --> 14:01.049
As if a yard of spandex
was gonna protect me from the world.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.929
How's the journal coming?

14:09.391 --> 14:10.392
Just stick with it.

14:11.435 --> 14:15.522
Putting your feelings down on paper,
it makes them real.

14:15.606 --> 14:17.441
Which can be terrifying.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.443
But that will give you power over them.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.781
And get some sleep.

14:24.865 --> 14:27.326
It's a big day tomorrow.

16:04.882 --> 16:06.258
Square-cut Torys…

16:07.509 --> 16:08.719
or cat-eye Miu Mius?

16:09.720 --> 16:10.721
Cat-eye.

16:20.480 --> 16:28.655
Oh, we'll be all right
If the wind is in our sails

16:29.281 --> 16:31.241
I'm excited to see where this is going.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.285
Forgive me.

16:33.368 --> 16:37.122
-And the storm will soon pass by
-And the storm will soon pass by

16:37.206 --> 16:38.916
It's a vacation tradition. Be over soon.

16:38.999 --> 16:42.002
And we'll stand fast
And steady as she goes

16:42.085 --> 16:50.260
We'll stand fast
And steady as she goes

16:50.344 --> 16:54.056
-And the storm will soon pass by
-And the storm will soon pass by

16:58.727 --> 17:00.771
I bet you didn't know
your mommy was a pirate.

17:00.854 --> 17:03.357
Storm. Once the cooler's done,
we're ready to go.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.652
Now, I know you're from Wisconsin, Leanne,

17:06.733 --> 17:09.319
but you're gonna want
warmer footwear. Trust me.

17:11.448 --> 17:13.575
I think it's just best
if you guys go without me.

17:15.536 --> 17:20.457
Absolutely not.
No, it wouldn't be right without you.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.794
No. I don't wanna ruin it for you.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.337
Well, that's why you need to come.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.339
I told you she wasn't ready.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.510
-It was gonna be a tight squeeze anyway.
-Julian.

17:31.593 --> 17:37.349
It's better this way for Jericho.
Just, you know, please avoid strangers.

17:40.644 --> 17:43.105
Traffic's getting worse by the second.

17:43.188 --> 17:44.690
We'll be home after dinner.

17:45.691 --> 17:46.692
Sure.

17:53.198 --> 17:54.199
Bye.

20:43.202 --> 20:45.120
Sean? Is everything okay?

20:45.204 --> 20:47.539
Yeah. Everything's great.
Just calling to check on you.

20:47.623 --> 20:48.624
You weren't followed?

20:49.750 --> 20:51.001
I don't think so.

20:51.585 --> 20:53.795
There's a couple of meatheads behind us,
but it's to be expected.

20:53.879 --> 20:54.880
We're in their country.

20:55.464 --> 20:56.632
Show me them.

21:01.762 --> 21:04.139
They pray to a different god.
Totally harmless.

21:05.599 --> 21:07.017
I think you're right.

21:08.060 --> 21:09.144
Is it nice there?

21:09.228 --> 21:11.104
Yeah. It's all right.

21:11.188 --> 21:15.776
I mean, Dorothy's radioactive with joy
any chance she gets to show off Jericho.

21:17.819 --> 21:20.405
Julian nearly sued the parking attendant.

21:20.489 --> 21:21.907
But look at him now!

21:24.326 --> 21:25.953
They look happy together.

21:26.036 --> 21:27.913
I wouldn't have thought rehab was
a place to hook up,

21:27.996 --> 21:30.582
but hell, who knows,
maybe this one will stick.

21:32.209 --> 21:33.710
You in the basement again?

21:37.798 --> 21:41.969
Right behind you. Third row down.
Six bottles in from the right.

21:42.052 --> 21:43.679
It's a '96 Petrus.

21:43.762 --> 21:45.472
It's vivacious but it's got a smooth floor

21:45.556 --> 21:48.225
that's gonna pair really nicely
with a bowl of tomato soup.

21:49.226 --> 21:52.729
So try to relax, and enjoy it.
You deserve it.

21:55.983 --> 21:56.984
Bye.

24:11.994 --> 24:13.745
Hey, Leanne. How are you?

24:13.829 --> 24:19.668
Tobe. You wanna come over?
There's nobody home.

24:22.796 --> 24:26.675
I'm wearing a swimsuit. It's two pieces.

24:27.718 --> 24:28.802
That sounds cold.

24:30.512 --> 24:33.348
I'm actually helping a friend move
to West Philly right now,

24:33.432 --> 24:35.058
but I can come over around 10:00.

24:58.081 --> 24:59.958
Dorothy? Is everything okay?

25:01.126 --> 25:02.586
I thought you'd wanna see this.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.507
Look at--

25:07.257 --> 25:09.176
He likes it.

25:11.386 --> 25:12.846
I thought you'd wanna see this too.

25:23.398 --> 25:24.399
It's freezing here.

25:24.483 --> 25:27.236
So, viewing from the comfort of home was
a wise choice.

25:29.571 --> 25:30.864
Thank you, Dorothy.

25:32.449 --> 25:33.784
Next time.

25:33.867 --> 25:35.452
We're headed home soon.

25:36.245 --> 25:37.538
You're not gonna believe this,

25:37.621 --> 25:41.083
but Julian was attacked
by a flock of rabid seagulls.

25:41.166 --> 25:44.545
I mean, they thought he was a crab cake.

25:44.628 --> 25:48.090
I don't blame them,
but they did cut up his face. Poor thing.

25:48.173 --> 25:50.592
But he'll be fine
after a couple booster shots or something.

25:50.676 --> 25:52.135
I don't know.

25:52.219 --> 25:54.805
We all need to be humbled
every once in a while.

25:54.888 --> 25:55.889
Don't tell him I said that.

25:57.057 --> 25:58.225
Okay. See ya soon. Ciao.

26:35.387 --> 26:36.805
Birds.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.811
And there was
another drive-by shooting today downtown.

27:24.895 --> 27:28.232
It appears to have been gang-related,
but there are no suspects yet.

27:49.336 --> 27:51.171
Hey, we're still trying to get outta here.

27:53.465 --> 27:54.466
Where are you?

27:55.342 --> 27:57.135
There's somebody in the house.

27:58.303 --> 27:59.304
Are you serious?

28:00.764 --> 28:01.765
What's going on?

28:02.891 --> 28:06.311
Then hide. Or-- Or get outta there.
I'll call the police.

28:06.895 --> 28:08.105
There's someone in the house.

28:23.161 --> 28:25.747
And there are three suspects now wanted

28:25.831 --> 28:29.543
in the murder of that Victoria girl
found last week in the river.

28:29.626 --> 28:31.628
And more coming up later.

28:31.712 --> 28:37.551
A man who exposed himself to police
officers in a doughnut shop claims that--

30:29.538 --> 30:33.208
Who sent you? Who's in charge now?

30:34.835 --> 30:36.044
I was like you.

30:37.129 --> 30:39.047
We weren't reborn just to follow.

30:41.258 --> 30:42.593
We have our own light.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.012
We have a choice.

30:46.180 --> 31:00.235
Police!

31:02.487 --> 31:04.031
Is anyone home?

31:13.415 --> 31:15.751
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

31:16.502 --> 31:18.170
Is she okay?

31:18.253 --> 31:19.421
I'm okay, Dorothy.

31:20.839 --> 31:22.799
I'm so sorry we left you.

31:23.967 --> 31:26.428
We shouldn't have left you.
It was a mistake.

31:28.388 --> 31:29.556
What happened?

31:30.724 --> 31:32.351
I just need to use the restroom.

31:34.937 --> 31:36.146
What happened?

31:36.230 --> 31:38.190
Evening, Mrs. Turner.

31:38.273 --> 31:40.359
From what your nanny,
Miss Grayson, tells us,

31:40.442 --> 31:42.778
and a preliminary look through the house,

31:42.861 --> 31:46.573
this break-in is consistent with
a string of burglaries in Society Hill.

31:47.157 --> 31:50.661
The intruder waits until families leave
for the weekend, like you,

31:50.744 --> 31:52.329
then he enters the home.

31:52.412 --> 31:55.707
He was able to gain access
through a skylight in your attic.

31:55.791 --> 31:59.545
Unfortunately, Miss Grayson
happened to be here at the time.

31:59.628 --> 32:03.048
And it appears he may have taken
several items from throughout the house.

32:18.230 --> 32:23.110
We're gonna get security cameras.
Cover the entire house.

32:23.193 --> 32:26.947
They are convinced
it's a run-of-the-mill burglary.

32:29.700 --> 32:32.035
Oh, look.

32:32.119 --> 32:35.372
It's the problem with being
a pattern-seeking creature.

32:36.623 --> 32:38.458
It all must make sense.

32:38.542 --> 32:43.547
There has to be a reason.
Things don't just happen, right?

32:45.048 --> 32:48.468
I don't know what's more cruel, really.

32:50.220 --> 32:55.934
To live in an indifferent world
or one that's constantly testing us.

33:01.773 --> 33:04.193
Either which way,
we're here for you, Leanne.
