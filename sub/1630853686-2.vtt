WEBVTT

00:06.840 --> 00:08.133
Erika?

00:09.551 --> 00:10.885
Erika?

00:12.012 --> 00:14.848
-Erika, are you okay?
-Holy shit show.

00:14.931 --> 00:17.600
I had a freaky death dream,
and I saw my own dead body.

00:17.684 --> 00:20.478
I was squish-squashed
like Spam jam under a moose,

00:20.562 --> 00:21.896
but all I could see were my feet.

00:21.980 --> 00:25.025
And in the dream, I vaguely remember
a truck that hit the moose

00:25.108 --> 00:27.902
that I guess hit me. God, it felt so real.

00:27.986 --> 00:30.864
You know, maybe I should go on Wellbutrin.

00:30.947 --> 00:33.450
Not sure Wellbutrin will help anymore.

00:34.909 --> 00:36.494
You are under a moose.

00:39.831 --> 00:42.208
Oh God! Oh God, what happened?

00:42.292 --> 00:43.752
-You passed out.
-No.

00:43.835 --> 00:45.795
What happened under the moose?

00:46.963 --> 00:48.465
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

00:48.548 --> 00:51.885
-It looks like you're, uh… you're, uh…

00:56.306 --> 01:00.268
This is just a dream.
This is just a really bad dream.

01:00.351 --> 01:01.895
It's… It's not real.

01:01.978 --> 01:04.773
It's an aftereffect
of all the shit that we did last night.

01:04.856 --> 01:07.525
-We're having a shared hallucination.
-Ooh! Yeah, that's fun.

01:08.109 --> 01:10.028
No. No, it's you. I checked.

01:10.111 --> 01:10.987
Shit.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.406
This is real?

01:17.577 --> 01:20.121
How… How am I there

01:20.705 --> 01:21.873
and still here?

01:22.373 --> 01:23.583
What am I?

01:24.626 --> 01:25.877
Am I a ghost?

01:25.960 --> 01:28.379
Or a highly visible apparition?

01:28.463 --> 01:30.006
I… I'm not an expert.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.010
I feel like I can't breathe… but I can.

01:34.844 --> 01:36.596
And really I need to pee. Do ghosts pee?

01:38.473 --> 01:39.808
Okay.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.146
I'm peeing and my head is throbbing.
I feel so strange.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.066
You are hungover.
You've never been hungover before.

01:48.149 --> 01:50.193
-From the party or the death?
-Probably both.

01:50.276 --> 01:53.113
This doesn't make sense.
How could I be dead and still peeing?

01:53.196 --> 01:55.031
And when did it get so cold?

01:58.785 --> 02:01.871
-Dying is a lot.
-Gia, I must be a ghost.

02:01.955 --> 02:02.956
Wait.

02:04.874 --> 02:05.875
Oh my God.

02:06.751 --> 02:09.337
I can feel you, and you can feel me.

02:10.755 --> 02:12.841
-And I can pee.
-And you can pee.

02:13.675 --> 02:15.093
Which has to mean…

02:17.720 --> 02:18.596
No idea.

02:24.519 --> 02:28.022
How did I end up in my bed this morning?
Okay, did I die and then morph home?

02:28.523 --> 02:30.275
-How did you get home?
-Dunno.

02:30.358 --> 02:33.862
All I know is that one minute we were
high on life, walking home from the party,

02:33.945 --> 02:36.322
and the next
I was spooning a jar of Nutella.

02:36.406 --> 02:38.283
-Watch where you're going!

02:38.366 --> 02:39.409
That asshole!

02:40.535 --> 02:41.744
Can see me!

02:41.828 --> 02:44.122
So you can see me,
and that guy can see me,

02:44.205 --> 02:47.876
so how can I be dead, walking and talking,
and still getting yelled at by idiots?

02:47.959 --> 02:49.919
-It's confounding.
-And overwhelming.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.589
-Dying is really traumatic.
-Yeah. It is.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.299
My brain hurts.

02:54.799 --> 02:56.134
Mochaccino time.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.895
They know.

03:07.937 --> 03:09.480
I'm gonna walk through it.

03:10.231 --> 03:11.065
Oh.

03:11.566 --> 03:15.445
-Do I have to be invited in?
-You're not a vampire. Pull, don't push.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.449
Don't just say
you don't notice, Terrine.

03:19.532 --> 03:22.660
It's like 30 degrees in here,
and my nips are on full display. What?

03:22.744 --> 03:24.537
-What?

03:24.621 --> 03:26.539
What… do… you… want?

03:26.623 --> 03:28.416
-Two mochaccinos.
-One without whip.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.127
-Did you get that?
-Yeah, I got it.

03:31.211 --> 03:34.464
Two mochaccinos,
and can someone turn down the air?

03:34.547 --> 03:36.007
That'll be $9.85.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.886
-How much do you have?
-I didn't bring my purse.

03:39.969 --> 03:42.639
We have no money. Shit.
I still have two bodies,

03:42.722 --> 03:45.683
and one of them is dead,
so I need my frickin' mochaccino now!

03:49.103 --> 03:52.232
-Register down. The system crashed.
-What?

03:53.900 --> 03:56.319
Until it's resolved, drinks are free.

03:56.402 --> 03:58.446
-Oh my gosh.
-All right, next.

03:58.529 --> 04:00.198
No. All the drinks are free.

04:01.157 --> 04:03.534
-I think I just did that.
-I think you did.

04:05.411 --> 04:06.579
I didn't want whip!

04:09.832 --> 04:10.833
Dick.

04:11.334 --> 04:13.461
-So what else can you do?
-Not sure.

04:13.544 --> 04:17.340
But my grandma used to say that my grandpa
would sometimes cross over through the TV

04:17.423 --> 04:20.051
and another small appliance
in the bedroom.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.053
-Vibrator.
-Vibrators have batteries.

04:22.136 --> 04:25.807
Not the old-fashioned kind. But, right,
ghosts communicate through electricity.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.726
And maybe sometimes control it,
which is how I took down the machine.

04:28.810 --> 04:32.438
-What? Is it me? Do I look freaky?

04:32.522 --> 04:36.067
Uh, can you watch my computer
while I go to the bathroom?

04:36.609 --> 04:37.610
Thanks.

04:44.867 --> 04:46.619
-Did I do that?

04:46.703 --> 04:48.496
Turn it off! Turn it off!

04:51.082 --> 04:53.251
-Man, that was crazy.

04:54.335 --> 04:55.461
And impressive.

04:55.545 --> 04:57.505
-Hey, put on a better song.
-Okay.

05:03.594 --> 05:04.721
It's working!

05:14.439 --> 05:16.316
What the hell are you doing?

05:30.121 --> 05:32.373
-Do you need another sweater?
-No, I'm good.

05:32.457 --> 05:35.126
Well, from everything
we've gathered,

05:35.209 --> 05:37.545
we know, A, your dad
needs to upgrade his technology,

05:37.628 --> 05:41.299
because, unlike you,
DVDs are not coming back to life, and B--

05:41.382 --> 05:43.718
There's nothing to work with.
How am I to know what to do

05:43.801 --> 05:46.846
if every movie, TV show, and website
makes up their own rules about ghosts?

05:46.929 --> 05:50.266
What are the facts?
What are the hard cold facts--

05:50.350 --> 05:53.019
Hey. Settle. Breathe.

05:53.936 --> 05:54.979
If you can.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.648
I know you're stressed
and anxious for concrete answers,

05:57.732 --> 05:59.233
but we do have something to work with.

05:59.317 --> 06:02.653
There are a few common denominators,
like ghosts can lower the temperature.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.030
And mess with electricity.

06:04.113 --> 06:05.948
-Blow out candles.
-Be sensed by animals.

06:06.032 --> 06:08.826
And sometimes give sexy massages
on pottery wheels.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.537
-That wasn't a common denominator.
-It was incredibly informative.

06:11.621 --> 06:14.540
True. That scene was filled
with highly analytical paranormal data.

06:14.624 --> 06:16.334
Maybe we should rewatch it.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.961
Yes. I can't believe I'm dead.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.589
Well, that's what happens
when you get wasted.

06:21.672 --> 06:25.635
Blackouts are real. Which is why
you need to stay hydrated when you drink,

06:25.718 --> 06:28.471
and make sure you get home
with your panties on and in one piece.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.974
No. You know what? I don't need to hear
about my daughter's missing panties.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.395
-Did you come in for a reason?
-We're taking Oliver to his game.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.856
And the liquor cabinet is unlocked,
so help yourself to some hair of the dog.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.608
Looks like you need it.

06:40.691 --> 06:42.860
-And I'm the line-crosser?
-Come on.

06:42.944 --> 06:43.945
-Wifey.
-Mm-mm.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.530
Fine, be like that.

06:45.613 --> 06:48.533
But does your cold heart
really need such a cold house?

06:48.616 --> 06:52.078
I mean, it's not even summer yet.
It's like we're living inside a glacier.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.247
-So weird.
-So weird.

06:54.330 --> 06:57.375
They're acting so normal. You'd think
people who birthed me would know I'm dead.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.292
One would think.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.962
-Know what I need to know?
-Why you're dead and still in human form?

07:01.045 --> 07:03.381
Yes. And why do I still have to pee?

07:04.966 --> 07:07.510
-Isn't it odd that I can pee?
-I dunno.

07:07.593 --> 07:10.847
If a ghost in <i>Ghostbusters</i> can give a BJ,
then it makes sense for you to pee.

07:12.640 --> 07:16.060
-Why? Why bother?
-Because it's gross.

07:16.144 --> 07:19.230
And if you can still touch me,
then you need to be ghost pee-free.

07:20.565 --> 07:24.485
Hey. I'm sorry. You can still touch me
with your ghost pee.

07:24.569 --> 07:27.029
-How long?
-For as long as you shall pee.

07:27.113 --> 07:27.947
No.

07:29.323 --> 07:30.867
How long do I have left?

07:31.409 --> 07:33.828
I'm in this weird limbo, but for how long?

07:33.911 --> 07:36.205
And, aside from the night I died,

07:36.289 --> 07:39.167
I really blew it lifewise.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.421
And what I wouldn't give for a do-over.

07:44.172 --> 07:47.800
To give myself a chance
to really let myself live.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.553
Erika, you lived. You lived.

07:50.636 --> 07:53.890
It was quietly with your inside voice,
but it was still a life.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.308
No, it wasn't.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.228
It was meaningless and uneventful.

07:59.854 --> 08:03.191
It was like a bad memory.
Or worse, no memory at all.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.568
And now I'm stuck in this weird in-between

08:05.651 --> 08:08.613
because I was probably too hungover
to walk towards the light.

08:13.117 --> 08:15.870
-I need a nap.
-Great! Big spoon or little spoon?

08:15.953 --> 08:18.122
No. I wanna be alone.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.208
Sorry.

08:20.958 --> 08:22.210
I'll call you later.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.462
If I can.

08:33.971 --> 08:36.390
-It's not just pee.

08:36.474 --> 08:39.143
All my fluids
are oozing from multiple holes.

08:39.227 --> 08:41.229
<i>So you barely made it</i>
<i>through last night too?</i>

08:43.523 --> 08:44.565
Hi!

08:44.649 --> 08:46.400
Yeah, just barely.

08:46.484 --> 08:49.278
<i>Well, get better soon,</i>
<i>because I'm having a hangover hang.</i>

08:49.362 --> 08:51.572
We're gonna have pizza, beer, hot tubbing.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.575
Wow! Party on a Sunday.
That sounds fun and all, but I--

08:54.659 --> 08:55.993
-Yes!
-Gah!

08:56.077 --> 08:58.246
<i>-Are you okay?</i>
-Gimme one sec.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.914
What are you doing?

08:59.997 --> 09:02.917
I was worried you might cross over.
I didn't want you to go alone.

09:03.000 --> 09:05.211
Do you remember that time
you packed extra backup pants--

09:05.294 --> 09:07.255
I do, yeah, but you are still on the call.

09:10.925 --> 09:13.469
Hi!
So is it cool if I bring Gia?

09:14.095 --> 09:14.971
<i>Bring her.</i>

09:15.054 --> 09:15.972
Okay.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.559
And I will see you in the hot tub.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.019
Actually,

09:23.020 --> 09:24.480
hold on. Sorry.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.776
-Can I go into a hot tub?
-I don't know. Research was inconclusive.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.486
At least I can't get pregnant.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.406
Oh, wait. Can I? Are ghost babies a thing?

09:33.489 --> 09:34.740
<i>-Uh, ghost babies?</i>
-Oh!

09:35.533 --> 09:38.077
Sorry. I thought you were muted.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.871
<i>And there I go, ruining my surprise.</i>
<i>Surprise!</i>

09:40.955 --> 09:43.791
<i>Ghost babies are a drink that I make.</i>

09:43.874 --> 09:46.377
It's like the Ambassador,
but with dry ice.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.630
-Do you have dry ice?
<i>-Uh… you know, I don't.</i>

09:49.714 --> 09:53.301
But I will by the time I see you next,
which should be soon.

09:53.384 --> 09:55.136
<i>I hope. Um…</i>

09:55.219 --> 09:58.055
<i>Looking forward</i>
<i>to drinking your ghost baby.</i>

09:58.139 --> 09:59.557
Me too!

10:01.684 --> 10:03.644
I can't actually have a ghost baby, right?

10:03.728 --> 10:06.147
Does it matter?
We're going to two parties in a row!

10:07.815 --> 10:10.192
Wait. We have to figure out
what's going on with me.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.652
Maybe I'm on borrowed time.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.154
Or, think of it this way,

10:13.237 --> 10:16.032
you're making the most out of
the little bit of life you have left.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.034
UYDDYGLL.

10:21.203 --> 10:22.371
Okay, yes!

10:22.455 --> 10:23.581
Let's go!

10:25.333 --> 10:27.043
Bye, dead body!

10:46.145 --> 10:48.397
The only face that's getting eaten tonight
is Jake C's.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.484
I don't know. You really think
this hot sauce is gonna deter the critters

10:51.567 --> 10:52.652
from this amazing feast?

10:52.735 --> 10:54.779
Animals don't have sophisticated palates.

10:54.862 --> 10:57.114
-Once the fire hits, they'll quit.
-What if you taste good?

10:57.198 --> 11:01.285
'Cause we don't have enough to cover
all of it. I mean-- I mean "her." Sorry.

11:01.369 --> 11:03.704
How should I ascend?
With my face or my ass?

11:03.788 --> 11:06.666
-Ooh. That is a toss-up.
-Well, I was born with this face…

11:06.749 --> 11:07.958
Which is gorgeous.

11:08.042 --> 11:10.753
…but this ass took work. Lose the face.

11:14.965 --> 11:18.094
-All right, let's live!
-Hold up. It's not even eight.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.888
-Good point. We show up at nine.
-Which means 10:30.

11:20.971 --> 11:23.557
But he said that they're starting early,
so ten?

11:24.225 --> 11:25.101
Ten.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.190
So what do you want to do
for the next two hours?

11:31.273 --> 11:34.110
Uh, we get to the bottom
of whatever the hell is going on.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.986
What's the point? It's not gonna explain

11:36.070 --> 11:38.489
why I'm walking, talking,
and peeing in bushes.

11:38.572 --> 11:39.865
If what I am is a ghost,

11:39.949 --> 11:42.284
I got screwed because there's zero perks
in this situation.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.787
True. You can't even walk through walls.

11:44.870 --> 11:46.831
Or become invisible to peep on Jake C.

11:46.914 --> 11:51.043
Yeah. I'm human adjacent with rando
temp control and Wi-Fi wavering.

11:51.585 --> 11:52.920
What a waste.

11:54.171 --> 11:55.548
-Was that you or Jake C?
-Hmm?

11:59.301 --> 12:02.847
Neither. It's the senior text chain.
I need to turn off the notifications.

12:02.930 --> 12:05.516
Hold up. There's a post
about a spirit sighting.

12:05.599 --> 12:07.685
Wait, what? Somebody knows about me?

12:10.438 --> 12:11.689
You can see it, right?

12:12.898 --> 12:14.316
I can kinda see it.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.317
Where?

12:15.901 --> 12:16.986
I think those are his eyes,

12:17.069 --> 12:19.947
and I'm pretty sure
that's, like, his weak chin.

12:20.030 --> 12:23.826
Totally. I see it. I think.
So you guys know a lot about spirits?

12:23.909 --> 12:27.329
I wouldn't say we know it all, but He's
always teaching and showing Himself

12:27.413 --> 12:29.415
in ways we never thought possible.

12:29.498 --> 12:30.332
The pizza guy?

12:30.416 --> 12:33.127
This manifestation is a learning
if we're open to the lesson.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.628
-I'm open.
-I'm open.

12:34.712 --> 12:35.755
I'm open.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.592
Are you following? I'm totally confused.

12:39.675 --> 12:41.552
Who are they seeing,
and what are they learning?

12:41.635 --> 12:43.012
Check your twelve o'clock.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.098
Checked. I think his name's Brett.

12:46.182 --> 12:48.851
Brad. Remember? He did
all that magic in freshman homeroom.

12:48.934 --> 12:52.188
-Oh, like with the cards?
-Yeah, but the spooky-ooky shit too.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.648
Oh, snap. I think
this is the Afterlifer's club.

12:54.732 --> 12:58.611
Yep. These kids know all about the occult.
I bet they have answers.

12:58.694 --> 13:02.323
Maybe they can tell me why I still pee.
And I have to. Again.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.992
Wait. Let's take a pic. Come on.

13:06.285 --> 13:07.703
<i>Isn't it a little soon?</i>

13:09.121 --> 13:12.166
-For what?
-To be two feet in with Sporty?

13:12.249 --> 13:14.877
Her name's Erika.
And no, it's not too soon.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.588
High school's almost over,
and I've wasted enough time as it is.

13:17.671 --> 13:20.132
-It's time to YOLO and go.
-YOLO? Bro, no.

13:20.216 --> 13:22.218
Don't you want our last few weeks

13:22.301 --> 13:24.053
to be drama-free?

13:24.136 --> 13:26.722
Okay, this isn't drama. Riley's drama.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.934
-Dude. You're about to be on a two-on-one.

13:30.017 --> 13:33.062
-What?
-That's when the nutjobs go head-to-head.

13:34.355 --> 13:36.065
-Wait. You don't watch <i>The Bachelor?</i>
-No.

13:36.148 --> 13:40.069
And this isn't a two-on-one sitch,
because Riley and I are done.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.487
But are you? Really?

13:41.570 --> 13:45.199
You are still in your 48-hour window
of fake break.

13:45.282 --> 13:48.536
-I'm not the only one that sees it. right?
-Guys, I like Erika.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.538
Cool, man. Cool.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.122
Feeling good for you.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.958
-Me too.
-Thanks, guys.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.377
Appreciate the support.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.254
Just what girls do for each other.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.674
Like, they might be all competing
to sit on the same dude's jock,

14:01.757 --> 14:04.552
but when shit really hits the fan,
they're there for each other.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.470
-Are you still talking about <i>The Bachelor?</i>
-Yep.

14:06.554 --> 14:10.224
Look, Jake. I really hope
someday we can be friends again.

14:10.307 --> 14:12.977
-Come on. Now you're drama.
-Riley is besties with Lea.

14:13.060 --> 14:15.437
If you break up with Riley,
I can't be friends with you.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.939
-That's just bullshit.
-It's not.

14:17.022 --> 14:20.109
And Jake W's my best friend,
so, if I can't roll, neither can he.

14:20.192 --> 14:21.777
-Sorry, dude.
-And Archer's weak.

14:21.861 --> 14:23.320
He'll do whatever we tell him.

14:23.404 --> 14:26.156
Yeah, uh, also happy
to slide into your sloppy seconds.

14:26.240 --> 14:28.033
-Hey, Jake.
-Yeah.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.540
So, from what you know,

14:34.623 --> 14:37.918
if you die and you don't go directly
to heaven, what are your other options?

14:38.002 --> 14:39.336
-Hell.
-Besides hell.

14:39.420 --> 14:40.880
-Yeah. Like what else?
-Hell.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.047
Just hell.

14:42.131 --> 14:43.299
Okay. Um…

14:44.133 --> 14:48.846
What if you die, but your body is still
living and breathing and eating pizza?

14:48.929 --> 14:50.139
Oh. You mean demons.

14:50.222 --> 14:53.309
-I think it's called purgatory.
-Purgatory! What about purgatory?

14:53.392 --> 14:55.060
That's just a road to hell.

14:55.144 --> 14:59.398
Only Catholics believe in that, and,
well… You know Catholics.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.984
Okay, so then how do you explain ghosts?

15:02.067 --> 15:03.694
-They don't exist.
-Dyl…

15:03.777 --> 15:06.071
Not true. There's one. The Holy Ghost.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.157
Can a person become the Holy Ghost?

15:09.658 --> 15:10.743
Jesus.

15:10.826 --> 15:13.621
-I'm not talking about Jesus.
-No, you're eating him!

15:14.663 --> 15:16.165
Huh.

15:16.665 --> 15:17.917
It's okay.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.919
It was just his beard.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.713
-I think.
-We've let him down. Let us pray.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.652
You're not gonna find
the answers you're looking for here.

15:44.735 --> 15:45.569
Why?

15:45.653 --> 15:47.529
They don't have answers.
They only have faith.

15:48.113 --> 15:50.366
If you really want answers,
you want my crew.

15:51.533 --> 15:52.701
The Afterlifers.

15:52.785 --> 15:56.413
-This isn't the Afterlifers?
-No. Newlifers. AKA Prayer Warriors.

15:56.497 --> 15:57.873
AKA Christ Comrades.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.668
I only come for the snacks.
We don't do snacks.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.837
Too many dietary restrictions.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.423
-So, how do I meet up with your crew--
-Sure you want to?

16:07.424 --> 16:09.134
'Cause what we do is no joke.

16:09.218 --> 16:13.138
And if you're not careful,
you may enter some crazy, dark shit.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.557
Crazier than Jesus Crust?

16:15.641 --> 16:16.892
I'm not being funny!

16:16.976 --> 16:18.477
This is serious!

16:18.560 --> 16:21.689
There are demons lying in wait

16:21.772 --> 16:24.316
to take over your body and eat your soul

16:24.400 --> 16:27.319
if you're not totally freakin' careful!

16:28.070 --> 16:29.113
-Okay.
-Message received.

16:29.196 --> 16:31.907
You'll need the bones of a mourning dove
and a packet of hemlock.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.287
Or Capri Suns.

16:38.664 --> 16:39.957
Get the variety pack.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.085
Let's go!

16:45.879 --> 16:46.755
Lea,

16:47.339 --> 16:48.549
your thing.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.802
Oh, right.

16:54.722 --> 16:57.558
I'm, uh, gonna be right back.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.402
Uh-uh. Stay.

17:09.737 --> 17:13.032
Wooh. So cold.

17:14.616 --> 17:16.368
It's 108 degrees in here.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.453
Listen.

17:18.245 --> 17:21.373
-I didn't know you were gonna be here.
-It's my house.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.334
I know, but…

17:26.045 --> 17:27.004
You know.

17:28.630 --> 17:31.925
Look, I can leave if you want.
It's no big deal.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.803
You know what?
Uh, that would be great, actually.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.430
Thank you. Yeah.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.682
Riley, I could take you home.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.061
Okay. Thanks.

17:52.279 --> 17:53.197
Jake.

17:54.865 --> 17:56.075
Are you okay?

17:57.993 --> 17:59.578
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:59.661 --> 18:00.996
You're not.

18:01.080 --> 18:04.333
And I'm not gonna leave
until I know you're okay.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.376
So,

18:07.044 --> 18:08.462
tell me what's going on.

18:08.545 --> 18:10.130
I… I can't tell you.

18:10.214 --> 18:13.133
Jake, I'm serious.
You don't have to protect me.

18:13.217 --> 18:16.011
I'm relieved we're not together anymore.

18:17.179 --> 18:19.056
I was tired of the drama.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.016
Really?

18:21.600 --> 18:22.559
Weren't you?

18:24.686 --> 18:27.106
So tell me. What's up?

18:29.066 --> 18:30.025
Okay.

18:31.902 --> 18:36.115
Well, I invited Erika over,
and she hasn't shown up yet.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.874
All phones are off, right?

18:45.958 --> 18:48.627
-Sorry. My mom.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.088
This isn't gonna work
unless you respect the process.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.090
Phones screw with the monitor,
along with moms.

18:53.173 --> 18:55.634
It's not our cells.
Mercury's in retrograde.

18:55.717 --> 18:58.220
FFS. Mercury's always in retrograde.

18:58.303 --> 19:01.348
I've been setting an intention
to have a ghost sighting for three weeks.

19:01.431 --> 19:04.726
-Ghosts are here. I know it.
-Uh, duh. It's a frickin' cemetery.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.687
-Bitch.
-No, enough.

19:06.770 --> 19:10.149
Maybe if you'd shut up a little, I can get
back in flow and communicate with some.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.609
I can't sense any goddamn spirits
unless I'm trancing,

19:12.693 --> 19:14.695
and I can't trance
unless you stop being assholes.

19:20.284 --> 19:22.870
-What do you want?
-Uh, info on the undead.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.456
Psychic vampire, right? You sure?

19:26.540 --> 19:28.625
'Cause I feel like
you're sucking my energy right now,

19:28.709 --> 19:30.294
and I didn't give you my consent.

19:30.377 --> 19:32.713
That's because I'm dead.

19:32.796 --> 19:34.673
So what are you all exactly?

19:34.756 --> 19:36.842
Um, excuse me? What are we?

19:36.925 --> 19:39.469
Sorry. How do you work with the dead?

19:39.553 --> 19:40.429
Nice reframe.

19:40.512 --> 19:43.557
Well, Brad's an aspiring
ceremonial magician,

19:43.640 --> 19:45.392
currently practicing low magic.

19:45.475 --> 19:47.060
Along with getting high.

19:47.144 --> 19:50.397
And Gavin's a medium
working through a spirit block.

19:50.480 --> 19:52.733
Because everyone's
always harshing my flow.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.944
Right. And, uh, Raven…
…is a star witch,

19:56.028 --> 19:59.615
which is basically a glorified astrologist
and something you can learn out of a book.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.868
Dude, you serious? All you can do
is hide a stupid quarter in my ear.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.786
You couldn't manifest
a hand job with yourself.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.872
All right, you witch bitch,
I fucking hex you.

20:06.955 --> 20:08.498
-I bind you, Brad.
-Okay. Whoa!

20:08.582 --> 20:09.708
-I hex you!
-Bind!

20:10.918 --> 20:13.587
Hey, come on, guys. You know the rules.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.714
No hexing, no cursing, and no poxing.

20:15.797 --> 20:17.507
And no doves, Brad.

20:17.591 --> 20:20.844
It was literally one dove
out of, what, 600?

20:22.679 --> 20:23.847
We don't do offensive magic.

20:23.931 --> 20:27.226
So I have been recently
on what I would call a, um…

20:27.809 --> 20:29.978
-A spiritual journey.
-Exactly.

20:30.062 --> 20:33.690
I have been on a spiritual journey,
and I've seen some stuff

20:33.774 --> 20:36.360
that one might call a ghost.

20:37.194 --> 20:40.656
So I was just wondering
your expert opinion on the rules.

20:41.323 --> 20:42.658
Who wants to take it?

20:42.741 --> 20:45.535
-Obviously you, you broomstick narcissist.
-Enough. Stop.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.247
Sometimes spirits can be
seen and heard by the living

20:48.330 --> 20:50.540
until their dead bodies are put to rest.

20:50.624 --> 20:51.792
Interesting.

20:51.875 --> 20:55.963
Uh, could a ghost still be seen
in their normal body in this phase?

20:56.546 --> 20:58.632
You mean like an embodied ghost?

20:58.715 --> 21:01.843
Sure. What would make a ghost embodied?

21:03.053 --> 21:04.596
Brad, you wanna explain?

21:04.680 --> 21:06.765
I totally boned a super hot ghost.

21:06.848 --> 21:10.143
Look, I didn't know she was a ghost
until she disappeared after the boning.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.562
Up until that point,
she was just a flicker of lights.

21:12.646 --> 21:15.440
I think she was once a girl
who lived in my house

21:15.524 --> 21:17.985
who died before she lost her virginity.

21:18.068 --> 21:21.154
So her unfinished business was to bone.

21:22.155 --> 21:25.492
To clarify. She needed her body
to finish her business.

21:25.575 --> 21:28.328
So he says. His house was built in 2011.

21:28.412 --> 21:31.581
-I think it was his cousin.
-Do you really want another hex?

21:31.665 --> 21:33.959
Before you do, one more quickie.

21:34.042 --> 21:37.713
So having an embodied body
is about unfinished business?

21:37.796 --> 21:38.880
Always.

21:38.964 --> 21:42.467
Ghosts are ghosts because they always have
unfinished business in their mortal life.

21:42.551 --> 21:43.385
Like what?

21:43.468 --> 21:45.012
Like something very personal

21:45.095 --> 21:47.347
which may be considered
unimportant and lame to others.

21:47.431 --> 21:48.974
And how do you know about all this?

21:50.600 --> 21:52.144
'Cause it's what we do.

21:53.103 --> 21:55.564
-Ghosts are what we do.
-We're paranormal experts.

21:55.647 --> 21:57.149
-Oh.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.735
Oh, I'm getting
a crazy strong vibe right now.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.653
Yeah, I'm feeling it.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.488
There's something.

22:03.572 --> 22:04.531
-Oh!

22:06.450 --> 22:07.659
-It's okay.

22:07.743 --> 22:08.744
-I bind.
-Get it out.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.078
-Mm-mm.
-Get it out.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.456
-They don't know anything.
-We don't know anything.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.791
I think that unfinished business stuff
makes sense.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.710
Really? My whole life
is unfinished business.

22:16.793 --> 22:19.004
What exactly is the one specific thing
keeping me here?

22:19.087 --> 22:21.173
What do I need my body to finish?

22:21.256 --> 22:23.717
I haven't ever started anything.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.345
Shit. It's almost midnight. We're so late.

22:26.428 --> 22:28.055
No, it's a kickback. It goes late.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.057
There's still time
to finish what we started.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.059
Wait. What did you just say?

22:32.851 --> 22:35.937
-There's still time to--
-To finish what we started!

22:36.605 --> 22:40.317
Can I get your number,
so we can finish what we started?

22:43.278 --> 22:46.573
I do have unfinished business.
Like Brad's girlfriend ghost.

22:46.656 --> 22:49.117
It is not what I have left to do.
It is who!

22:49.743 --> 22:51.411
I have to kiss Jake C.

22:51.495 --> 22:52.996
And the time is now. We gotta go!

23:02.005 --> 23:02.839
Well,

23:03.382 --> 23:05.092
maybe she had an accident.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.176
Doubtful.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.970
-Or maybe she's dead.

23:09.054 --> 23:11.681
-Nah. She ghosted me.

23:11.765 --> 23:12.891
I'm sorry.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.560
You deserve someone
who'll show up for you.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.979
Sorry she ruined your night.

23:18.063 --> 23:20.941
I appreciate that, but, you know,
my night wasn't completely ruined.

23:21.858 --> 23:23.527
You know, in some weird way,

23:23.610 --> 23:26.780
this conversation was
the most connected to you I've ever felt.

23:28.281 --> 23:30.909
It's almost a shame things are over.

23:30.992 --> 23:33.161
Yeah, what a bummer it's too late.

23:34.371 --> 23:35.956
-Yeah.
-Well.

23:37.165 --> 23:38.375
Good night, friend.
