NARRATOR:
Three weeks ago,

00:03.962 --> 00:06.374
an invisible dome crashed down
on Chesterâ€™s Mill,

00:06.548 --> 00:08.459
cutting us off
from the rest of the world.

00:09.176 --> 00:10.507
The dome has tested our limits,

00:11.178 --> 00:14.136
forcing each of us to confront
our own personal demons:

00:14.806 --> 00:15.932
rage,

00:17.100 --> 00:18.715
grief,

00:19.144 --> 00:20.429
fear.

00:20.604 --> 00:21.639
My God.

00:23.315 --> 00:24.430
Now, in order to survive,

00:24.608 --> 00:27.566
we must battle
our most dangerous adversary:

00:28.028 --> 00:30.144
The enemy within.

With What?

00:43.877 --> 00:45.663
This fluid is finite and precious.

00:46.672 --> 00:49.505
Whatever the leader does,
the group will follow.

Sometimes it's a relief
to admit who you really are.

HUNTER: I asked Norrie to go with me

00:57.307 --> 00:58.513

Christine Price is the experiment,
and you, Mr. Rennie, are the control.

01:24.960 --> 01:28.043
I brought you here
to show you something.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.083
You see?

Right there is where Christine Price
became something else.

01:40.934 --> 01:45.519
And that's Eva Sinclair,
her assistant.

01:52.154 --> 01:54.611
There you have it.
The dome came down,

01:56.116 --> 01:59.779
and a mini-dome came down
over the egg.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.784
Why are you showing me this?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.321
On a cellular level,

02:04.499 --> 02:08.458
the person you know as Christine
is not of this Earth.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.875
But she is something very foreign.

Well, I could have told you that
without your fancy equipment.

Mr. Rennie, we are only hours away

02:37.991 --> 02:40.528
from isolating the inhuman properties

02:40.952 --> 02:44.911
The effect that, that has
when injected into an uninfected host

02:45.082 --> 02:47.664

we could help the world.

to find fragments of meteors

that if you knew the truth,

30:49.139 --> 30:51.596
This first one's gonna
put you to sleep,

30:52.976 --> 30:55.183
the second one will stop your heart.

30:58.315 --> 31:00.306
Just look at me.

31:01.318 --> 31:03.354
Just look at me.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.191
There you go.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.153
No.

31:14.331 --> 31:15.867
No! Stop, I want this!

31:16.041 --> 31:18.157
- What?
HUNTER: I don't wanna be a burden.

31:19.086 --> 31:20.166
He wants this.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.047
You'll understand one day.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.254
Let's get him the hell out of here.

31:31.556 --> 31:33.467
- Come on, Hunter. Come on.
- Come on.

31:33.642 --> 31:34.722
- Come on.
- Come on.

31:40.607 --> 31:43.565
All right, Junior, why don't you
run up ahead? Get the boat ready.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.316
Sure.

31:52.994 --> 31:55.451
So we have a conversation
that we need to finish.

31:55.789 --> 31:58.246
IbeHeve
the outstanding question was

31:58.834 --> 32:00.540
who are you?

32:03.588 --> 32:07.672
I worked for Aktaion
and was tasked with finding the egg.

32:08.218 --> 32:10.425
And what did Aktaion tell you
the egg was?

32:10.595 --> 32:14.804
They said it had the potential
to be the next great energy source.

32:14.975 --> 32:20.060
And they saw that we wanted
to be a part of something great, and...

32:22.274 --> 32:23.354
What is it?

32:25.026 --> 32:28.769
When I made contact with the egg,
it triggered the dome.

32:29.239 --> 32:30.900
I trapped all of us inside it.

32:31.074 --> 32:34.658
Every death,
every family that was separated,

32:35.287 --> 32:36.447
it's my fault.

32:36.621 --> 32:39.658
Well, Aktaion used a lot
of really good people

32:40.083 --> 32:42.119
for a lot of terrible things.

32:43.378 --> 32:46.620
My guess is that they knew they were
sending you into something dangerous.

32:49.176 --> 32:51.007
It's not your fault.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.589
JULIA:
Barbie, get away from her.

32:53.763 --> 32:55.139
BARBIE:
Julia, what are you doing?

32:55.307 --> 32:57.013
She's not who she says she is.

32:57.184 --> 32:58.720
I know what you really are.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.384
Julia's the one
who gave me to them.

33:02.063 --> 33:05.647
She held me at gunpoint
and handed me over to Aktaion.

33:05.817 --> 33:06.932
And I'd do it again.

33:07.527 --> 33:09.563
Aktaion was only trying to help.

33:09.738 --> 33:11.069
Barbie, she is dangerous.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.231
Then let's talk, all right?
Just you and me,

33:14.409 --> 33:15.569
no guns.

33:17.913 --> 33:20.905
- Julia, come on. Lower the gun.
- Not a chance.

33:22.209 --> 33:24.541
All right, then I'm coming to you.

33:37.349 --> 33:39.806
Come here. I'm right here.

33:44.773 --> 33:47.230
It's just you and me, all right?

33:50.445 --> 33:51.901
So, what's going on?

33:53.198 --> 33:56.315
Christine and Eva work for Aktaion.
I have proof.

34:00.497 --> 34:01.577
I know.

34:01.748 --> 34:05.206
- They told me. Julia, they used them.
- There's more.

34:06.002 --> 34:09.290
I know how this is gonna sound,
so I need you to trust me.

34:10.298 --> 34:14.507
Yes, Christine works for Aktaion,
but that's not the real Christine.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.260
When Melanie placed the egg
on her cocoon,

34:17.430 --> 34:21.594
something from inside it
went into the others, and now it is--

34:21.810 --> 34:25.098
It's growing inside of everyone
like an infection.

34:25.981 --> 34:28.267
- I feel fine.
- I know you feel fine,

34:28.817 --> 34:31.183
- but you're different.
- Julia, do you even hear yourself?

34:31.361 --> 34:34.273
Barbie, think about it.
You were manipulated into killing Pete.

34:34.447 --> 34:35.903
No, it was self-defense.

34:36.074 --> 34:40.408
Christine and Eva are not themselves,
and they are using you.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.911
- They want you to become like them.
- Eva.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.787
Again, let's just be honest here,
all right?

34:45.000 --> 34:48.413
- That's what this is about.
- You're not listening to me.

34:49.754 --> 34:52.006
Look, I know you.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.961
I love you.

34:56.511 --> 35:00.629
But you're sick,
and they want you to stay that way.

35:01.266 --> 35:05.054
You can't bring her
back to Chester's Mill.

35:05.854 --> 35:08.766
You tell me that I'm not myself.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.273
You just handed over
an innocent woman

35:16.448 --> 35:21.238
to be experimented on
and tortured by Aktaion.

35:21.411 --> 35:23.527
- Barbie, you are not hearing me.
- No, no, no.

35:23.705 --> 35:26.993
The only person that's changed here
is you.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.579
Now, Christine has been nothing
but great for this town.

35:30.754 --> 35:32.790
If you can't accept that,

35:32.964 --> 35:37.503
you need to stay here
and never come back.

35:53.401 --> 35:57.110
It was Joe and Norrie
who let Julia out and freed Hunter.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.941
I'll worry about them now.

35:59.115 --> 36:02.403
I have plans for Joe. He's gonna be
instrumental in an upcoming project.

36:02.577 --> 36:03.942
You focus on Barbie.

36:04.120 --> 36:07.829
He took a big step today,
but there's still progress to make.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.990
The trauma that he suffered
in his military service

36:10.168 --> 36:12.329
has made him more resistant
than most.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.119
At least he finally trusts you.

36:15.465 --> 36:17.547
I became what he needed me to be.

36:17.717 --> 36:20.333
A victim for him to save.

36:21.221 --> 36:23.633
I need to ask you
a personal question.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.973
Have the two of you slept together
since being in Chester's Mill?

36:28.186 --> 36:29.266
Not yet.

36:30.105 --> 36:31.515
Well, the sooner
you become his mate,

36:31.731 --> 36:34.143
the sooner he'll be
what I need him to be.

36:34.567 --> 36:36.068
Our protector.

36:37.153 --> 36:38.654
I can do that.

37:03.346 --> 37:05.177
I was just thinking about you.

37:06.141 --> 37:07.551
You look good.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.466
SobeL

37:09.728 --> 37:11.218
I cleaned myself up.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.272
Why the change of heart?

37:16.151 --> 37:21.145
I saw a glimpse of my future
if I continued along the path I was on.

37:24.159 --> 37:26.650
When I left yesterday,
I went to Abby's.

37:27.287 --> 37:30.575
She didn't answer
when I called out for her.

37:30.999 --> 37:32.364
I found her in the tub.

37:33.251 --> 37:35.583
I have a feeling
I know where this story goes.

37:37.839 --> 37:39.579
I'm sorry I strayed.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.382
We all get lost.

37:46.681 --> 37:49.923
The important thing
is that you're here now.

37:52.103 --> 37:54.139
You did it for me, didn't you?

37:54.898 --> 37:56.308
Abby couldn't have gotten the pills.

37:56.483 --> 37:59.725
She already tried to kill herself once,
but I saved her.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.735
This time, I was too late.

38:04.824 --> 38:06.815
But you saved me.

38:07.994 --> 38:09.905
You pulled me out of the quicksand.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.407
Thank you.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.248
It needed to be done.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.834
You mean the world to all of us.

38:22.425 --> 38:23.881
[KNIFE PIERCING FLESH]

38:26.971 --> 38:29.007
You shouldn't have done that
to Abby.

[CHRISTINE GRUNTING]

38:32.101 --> 38:33.602
I'm sorry,

38:33.770 --> 38:35.806
but I'll never be able
to be who you want.

38:43.238 --> 38:45.274
Thank you, everyone.

38:46.241 --> 38:48.277
Done a good job today.

38:48.451 --> 38:50.658
Christine will be proud.

38:53.289 --> 38:55.029
Christine?

38:57.168 --> 39:01.411
People are all moved in. I wanted
to ask you about these designs.

39:05.051 --> 39:06.131
What happened?

39:06.511 --> 39:07.591
What do I do?

39:07.887 --> 39:09.673
Get me to the caves.

39:14.394 --> 39:17.136
NORRIE: Who's there?
- Norrie, it's just me.

39:17.313 --> 39:19.269
Is there anything we can do for him?

39:19.983 --> 39:21.644
I don't think so.

39:21.818 --> 39:24.025
When he wakes up,
he's gonna be in a lot of pain.

39:24.195 --> 39:28.029
He said he didn't wanna be a burden,
but what does that even mean?

39:28.199 --> 39:31.066
Julia said they were gonna kill him
because he couldn't use his legs.

39:31.244 --> 39:32.359
That's so messed up.

39:32.537 --> 39:35.199
Well, if they're willing to kill him
just because of that,

39:35.373 --> 39:37.455
then we need to do
exactly what Julia said

39:37.625 --> 39:39.741
and keep our heads down.

39:47.635 --> 39:50.342
I've been looking for you everywhere.

We can go in one
of these abandoned tents.

40:07.322 --> 40:10.109
It'll be just like old times.

40:13.536 --> 40:15.447
Sorry.

Everything that happened today
with Julia,

40:21.169 --> 40:23.626
what she did to Christine.

40:26.633 --> 40:29.170
Maybe she was never the person
you thought she was.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.634
Maybe.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.803
I'm gonna go for a walk.

Yeah, same goes for you.

You find your action hero?

Tell him something
from another planet's

42:11.070 --> 42:14.358
Much as I hate to admit it,
you were right.

42:15.074 --> 42:16.234
Barbie's not the same.

42:16.409 --> 42:18.821
And Aktaion's all dead.

So much for them helping me
get out of here.
