WEBVTT

00:03.500 --> 00:04.792
Isn't this nice?

00:04.875 --> 00:06.709
We're all here together
sharing family time.

00:06.792 --> 00:09.750
Mom, please. Celebrity Pet Castle is on.

00:10.083 --> 00:12.000
Who would have thought
a show about celebrity pets

00:12.083 --> 00:14.625
living together in a castle
would be so great?

00:14.709 --> 00:16.917
Last week, Howie Mandel's cat

00:17.000 --> 00:18.917
- ate one of Jack Black's guppies.
- Oh, cool.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.583
Well, I was thinking
we could turn the TV off.

00:20.667 --> 00:22.000
Wait, wait, wait! Not now. Not now.

00:22.083 --> 00:23.834
- They're starting with an elimination!
- Ooh.

00:23.917 --> 00:25.792
- I'll get the popcorn.
- Okay.

00:26.625 --> 00:28.208
I would not want to be

00:28.291 --> 00:29.959
Beyoncé's hamster right now.

00:32.041 --> 00:33.333
- What?
- What?

00:34.667 --> 00:37.500
Mouse! I saw a mouse!

00:37.583 --> 00:39.166
It was like this big.

00:39.625 --> 00:42.667
Oh, and your high-pitched girl scream
scared it away.

00:42.750 --> 00:44.834
Hey, hey, look at this.

00:45.834 --> 00:47.625
- Mouse droppings.
- Oh.

00:47.709 --> 00:48.667
Teddy: Oh.

00:49.834 --> 00:51.542
That's a Rocky Mountain Grey...

00:52.166 --> 00:54.750
Female.

00:57.583 --> 00:59.208
About to be a mother.

00:59.875 --> 01:01.250
That is just gross, okay?

01:01.333 --> 01:03.959
I do not want a mouse
or mouse babies in this house.

01:04.041 --> 01:06.083
Aw, mouse babies.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.166
Ew! Oh!

01:08.625 --> 01:11.250
All right, don't worry about it.
It's not a problem.

01:11.333 --> 01:12.709
You know what? Have a seat.

01:12.792 --> 01:14.750
Watch a master exterminator in action.

01:14.834 --> 01:16.458
Or we could get back to the show.

01:16.542 --> 01:18.834
Simon Cowell's turtle
is coming out of his shell.

02:19.542 --> 02:21.375
- Dad, can I get a new phone?
- Nope.

02:22.834 --> 02:24.625
Daddy. Hmm.

02:24.709 --> 02:27.542
Can I please get a new phone, please?

02:27.625 --> 02:30.583
Well, since you put it like that...

02:31.375 --> 02:32.333
No.

02:32.834 --> 02:34.750
What? But this old phone is useless.

02:34.834 --> 02:38.333
I can't... I can't download apps,
I can't post status updates.

02:38.417 --> 02:40.583
The only thing I can do on it is talk.

02:40.667 --> 02:42.500
Nobody does that anymore.

02:42.583 --> 02:44.834
Okay. All right. You want...
You want a new phone?

02:44.917 --> 02:45.875
Yes.

02:46.834 --> 02:49.208
- There you go. New phone.
- Hmm.

02:49.291 --> 02:51.375
Unlimited minutes. And it squeaks.

02:52.875 --> 02:53.875
Good for you, Dad.

02:53.959 --> 02:55.583
Tell the princess "no" for once.

02:55.667 --> 02:57.375
Um, excuse me, but this princess

02:57.458 --> 02:59.417
spends a lot less time
on her hair than you do.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.000
What's your problem, anyway?

03:03.125 --> 03:05.542
My problem is everything
gets handed to you.

03:05.625 --> 03:08.208
This is like the first time in history
something didn't go your way.

03:08.291 --> 03:11.208
Look, honey, if you want a phone,
get a job.

03:11.291 --> 03:14.083
I'm only 15.
What, what kind of job could I get?

03:14.166 --> 03:15.083
All right, you know what?

03:15.166 --> 03:16.750
There's all sorts of dogs
in the neighborhood.

03:16.834 --> 03:18.000
You could walk dogs.

03:18.834 --> 03:19.917
Or...

03:20.000 --> 03:22.583
Or not get a new phone.

03:23.583 --> 03:26.083
Teddy, a job isn't just about money.

03:26.375 --> 03:29.041
It's also about self-worth and dignity.

03:31.583 --> 03:32.625
Wow.

03:34.709 --> 03:37.500
Okay, everybody, we are off
to our music class.

03:37.583 --> 03:39.250
You look so cute.

03:39.375 --> 03:42.250
Aww, Charlie, did you hear
what your big sister said about you?

03:42.333 --> 03:44.375
I was talking to you, Mom.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.709
Oh, you're so sweet.

03:46.792 --> 03:48.125
And you're not getting a phone.

03:52.792 --> 03:56.250
Okay, people, the fried chicken business
has taken a hit.

03:56.333 --> 04:00.834
Apparently, fried is now bad
for your health.

04:01.458 --> 04:04.792
So we need to think of ways
of increasing our sales.

04:04.875 --> 04:06.709
Dazzle me! You.

04:06.792 --> 04:09.083
How about we introduce tacos to our menu?

04:09.166 --> 04:11.709
Too easy, too expected. Push it, people.

04:11.792 --> 04:13.709
Punch it! Yeah?

04:13.792 --> 04:16.333
How about we fry up other
cheaper kinds of meat

04:16.417 --> 04:19.792
and tell people it's chicken,
only it's not chicken?

04:21.417 --> 04:24.250
Yeah, we're already doing that.
You had number three lately?

04:25.125 --> 04:26.792
Work with me, minimum wagers.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.458
Give me something! What do you got, JP?

04:29.542 --> 04:31.208
- Uh, it's PJ.
- Whatever. Go.

04:31.625 --> 04:35.083
Well, what if we give the business a face?

04:35.166 --> 04:37.709
Someone who is Kwikki Chikki.

04:37.792 --> 04:40.458
Someone to put on posters
and bags and buckets.

04:40.542 --> 04:43.208
- Like Bobby Burger.
- I like Bobby Burger.

04:43.291 --> 04:45.250
He always eats all the burgers.

04:47.583 --> 04:50.041
See? That is what we're missing.

04:50.125 --> 04:53.291
We don't have a Mr. Kwik!

04:53.375 --> 04:56.667
Mr. Kwik? Mr. Kwik. Tell me more.

04:56.750 --> 04:59.166
Well, he should be an employee.

04:59.250 --> 05:03.083
Probably young, good looking, healthy.

05:03.166 --> 05:04.542
You're thinking me, right?

05:04.917 --> 05:09.333
Or someone young, good looking, healthy.

05:11.166 --> 05:12.875
Mr. Kwik.

05:12.959 --> 05:14.500
I'm gonna sleep on it, all right?

05:14.583 --> 05:17.625
All right, people, doors open
in ten, so look lively.

05:18.250 --> 05:20.500
Oh, and what is that smell?

05:20.583 --> 05:22.166
- That's our chicken.
- Oh.

05:22.709 --> 05:25.500
Twenty years in the business.
You never get used to it.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.083
What are you doing, Dad?

05:33.166 --> 05:36.834
I am loading the mouse trap
with a tasty little snack

05:36.917 --> 05:38.959
of peanut butter and horror.

05:41.041 --> 05:43.208
What? You, you haven't caught
that thing yet?

05:43.333 --> 05:45.417
Kids, let me explain something to you.

05:45.500 --> 05:48.000
Now I'm not just a guy who catches things.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.083
Clearly.

05:50.583 --> 05:53.250
I am also an expert in animal behavior.

05:53.625 --> 05:55.834
Now the Rocky Mountain Grey
feeds at night.

05:55.917 --> 05:57.959
So by tomorrow morning,

05:58.041 --> 06:00.750
this trap is going to have a mouse in it.

06:01.208 --> 06:04.625
And that, my friend, is a guarantee.

06:05.834 --> 06:07.166
One hundred percent.

06:12.500 --> 06:15.250
Somebody needs to take him down a peg.

06:16.083 --> 06:17.291
Are you gonna mess with Dad?

06:17.375 --> 06:19.917
I'm Gabe. It's what I do.

06:21.625 --> 06:23.709
Women: ♪ That's the way the money goes ♪

06:23.792 --> 06:25.625
♪ Pop goes the weasel. ♪

06:25.709 --> 06:27.458
Good job.

06:27.542 --> 06:29.959
Great job, everybody.

06:30.250 --> 06:31.959
Okay, we're gonna take
a little juice break,

06:32.041 --> 06:34.625
then we will come back
for dance-a-lance-a-ling-long!

06:38.583 --> 06:39.583
Oh.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.166
I'm Elaine, by the way.

06:41.250 --> 06:42.834
Oh, nice to meet you.

06:42.917 --> 06:45.542
I'm Amy, and this is my daughter Charlie.

06:45.625 --> 06:46.542
Charlie?

06:46.625 --> 06:49.166
Like, Charlie Brown?

06:49.917 --> 06:51.709
No, not like Charlie Brown.

06:51.792 --> 06:53.750
Charlie, like, short for Charlotte.

06:53.834 --> 06:57.834
Oh, well, as long as it
makes sense to you.

06:59.291 --> 07:02.250
- And who is this?
- This is Brittany.

07:02.375 --> 07:03.834
Yes, you are.

07:03.917 --> 07:06.834
- Oh, that's so adorable.
- Yeah.

07:06.917 --> 07:09.208
You named her after a troubled pop star.

07:11.875 --> 07:14.792
I, uh, I noticed Charlie
was very good at clapping.

07:15.250 --> 07:17.166
Oh, yes, it's one of her many talents.

07:17.250 --> 07:20.792
Aww, Brittany was clapping
at six months, so...

07:21.834 --> 07:24.542
Charlie makes animal sounds.

07:24.625 --> 07:26.083
Charlie, what does a cow say?

07:26.667 --> 07:27.834
Woof.

07:28.709 --> 07:29.917
Very impressive.

07:32.041 --> 07:33.750
Oh, uh, just so you know,

07:33.834 --> 07:36.417
uh, next class, we're asking
every mom and child

07:36.500 --> 07:39.792
- to perform a song together.
- Oh! Well, that sounds fun.

07:39.875 --> 07:42.583
And just so you know,
it's not a competition.

07:43.208 --> 07:45.542
It wouldn't be fair
with my musical theater background.

07:45.625 --> 07:47.834
I was on Broadway.

07:48.083 --> 07:50.792
Oh, and now you're here,

07:50.875 --> 07:52.750
so we see how that turned out.

08:01.917 --> 08:03.125
What happened to you?

08:03.208 --> 08:05.500
I took your suggestion
and became a dog walker.

08:07.667 --> 08:12.333
A, uh, Great Dane and a Labradoodle
took turns dragging me through a puddle.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.583
So, thanks.

08:15.834 --> 08:16.917
You're welcome.

08:18.417 --> 08:19.583
What's in the bag?

08:19.667 --> 08:21.542
Um, mostly Great Dane.

08:25.041 --> 08:27.250
- Where should I put it?
- Trash can.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.959
Mrs. Dabney's trash can.

08:32.959 --> 08:34.250
Hey, Dad, guess what.

08:34.333 --> 08:36.083
You washed the car like I asked?

08:36.792 --> 08:38.166
You are really bad at guessing.

08:39.000 --> 08:42.458
No, I had an idea at work
and my boss loved it.

08:42.542 --> 08:45.166
- Hey, good for you.
- Yeah, it was a great moment.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.834
And who knows?

08:46.917 --> 08:49.041
Mr. Kwik could be the start
of something big.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.000
This is amazing.

08:55.083 --> 08:58.291
Ever since you became Mr. Kwik,
business is booming.

08:58.375 --> 09:00.875
I just want to say, thank you, PJ.

09:04.375 --> 09:06.125
How am I gonna get all that money home?

09:06.208 --> 09:07.500
You could put it in the trunk

09:07.583 --> 09:10.250
of your brand new car!

09:26.792 --> 09:28.542
Can I have your autograph, Mr. Kwik?

09:28.625 --> 09:29.875
Absolutely.

09:32.125 --> 09:34.083
And who am I making this out to?

09:34.166 --> 09:36.000
Mrs. Kwik.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.875
Nice car.

09:41.417 --> 09:42.917
When are you gonna wash mine?

09:43.834 --> 09:45.375
Dad, get out of my fantasy.

09:54.458 --> 09:56.250
Oh, hello, little mouse.

09:56.709 --> 09:58.417
Wanna help me mess with Dad?

10:05.667 --> 10:07.125
Dad!

10:13.000 --> 10:14.125
We have a mouse?

10:14.208 --> 10:17.125
No. But the bait is gone.

10:17.208 --> 10:18.250
What?

10:19.083 --> 10:20.709
Oh, come on. That's impossible.

10:20.792 --> 10:23.417
- How could a mouse do that?
- I don't know.

10:23.500 --> 10:25.000
It's almost like he's mocking you.

10:29.166 --> 10:32.083
Okay, mouse wants to dance,

10:34.000 --> 10:35.375
we're gonna dance.

10:39.542 --> 10:42.250
I wonder what kids
with smart Dads do for fun.

10:46.125 --> 10:49.667
Okay. Guys, I'm going inside
for just a minute.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.792
And while I'm gone no sniffing,

10:51.875 --> 10:53.917
no biting, and no scooching.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.250
And Brutus, come here, buddy.

10:56.333 --> 10:59.750
Remember, Fifi is not a chew toy. Okay?

11:02.625 --> 11:05.875
Uh, so, Mitch, did you have a chance
to think about my Mr. Kwik idea?

11:05.959 --> 11:07.125
Yes, I did, JP.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.291
Or should I say... Mr. Kwik!

11:09.375 --> 11:10.750
- Really? Me?
- Uh-huh.

11:10.834 --> 11:13.000
Yup, you're the new face of Kwikki Chikki.

11:13.083 --> 11:16.333
I see great things ahead for you.
The future is bright.

11:16.417 --> 11:18.208
Does the future include a bump in pay?

11:18.250 --> 11:19.542
No, it does not.

11:20.166 --> 11:21.834
Well, doesn't matter.

11:21.917 --> 11:23.792
Being Mr. Kwik is reward enough.

11:24.959 --> 11:26.375
- Free soft drinks? Hmm.
- Nope.

11:27.625 --> 11:28.709
But you were right, kid.

11:28.792 --> 11:30.792
The face of Kwikki Chikki
needs to be young,

11:30.875 --> 11:32.375
healthy, good looking.

11:32.458 --> 11:33.709
Like that!

11:34.959 --> 11:36.000
You mean this?

11:36.083 --> 11:37.875
Oh, no, no, no. This, ain't that.

11:37.959 --> 11:41.208
This is good, but that is great.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.291
She can't be Mr. Kwik. She's a girl.

11:43.375 --> 11:44.834
Then forget about Mr. Kwik.

11:44.917 --> 11:47.083
She'll be our Kwikki Chick!

11:47.166 --> 11:49.125
Are you ready to be the face
of Kwikki Chikki?

11:50.375 --> 11:52.166
I just wanted to use the bathroom.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.750
I just don't understand
why you're mad at me.

12:03.834 --> 12:06.500
Okay. I'm mad at you because
you did it again.

12:06.583 --> 12:09.166
You walked right in there
and got the job handed to you.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.208
My job.

12:10.291 --> 12:11.834
I didn't do it on purpose.

12:11.917 --> 12:14.583
Do you know how long I was Mr. Kwik?

12:14.667 --> 12:16.041
Thirty-seven seconds.

12:16.125 --> 12:17.458
That's too quick.

12:19.000 --> 12:20.834
What do you want me to do?

12:20.917 --> 12:22.375
Quit. You already have a job.

12:22.458 --> 12:24.750
Yeah, walking dogs? It's disgusting.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.083
No offense, guys.

12:27.166 --> 12:29.959
PJ, I'm sorry you didn't get the job,

12:30.041 --> 12:32.250
but I'm not sorry I did.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.500
Of course you're not, princess.

12:34.583 --> 12:37.458
- Stop calling me that!
- Stop being that!

12:40.041 --> 12:42.917
Oh, Brutus, again? Really?

12:45.333 --> 12:47.041
I'm gonna miss you least of all.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.500
Night vision goggles? Check.

13:04.333 --> 13:07.000
- What are you doing?
- I'm catching a mouse.

13:07.083 --> 13:09.458
With night vision goggles? Really?

13:09.542 --> 13:11.083
Whatever it takes.

13:11.625 --> 13:13.583
Nobody makes a fool of Bob Duncan.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.834
No.

13:15.291 --> 13:16.792
He does that all by himself.

13:19.250 --> 13:22.709
Go back upstairs to bed
and let the expert do his job.

13:32.125 --> 13:33.375

There's our Kwikki Chick!

15:18.000 --> 15:21.333
All right, so all you have to do
is sit here,

15:21.375 --> 15:24.041
- sign autographs and eat chicken.
- I can do that.

15:24.125 --> 15:26.041
- JP, get over here.
- It's PJ.

15:26.125 --> 15:29.250
Wrong. From now on your name is assistant.

15:29.375 --> 15:31.250
As in assistant to the Kwikki Chick.

15:31.375 --> 15:34.208
If she needs anything,
and I mean anything,

15:34.250 --> 15:35.417
you get it for her.

15:35.500 --> 15:38.750
Now, um, Mitch, he...
PJ doesn't have to wait on me.

15:38.834 --> 15:42.000
Oh, yes, he does.
Because in our little kingdom,

15:42.083 --> 15:43.500
you're the princess.

15:46.417 --> 15:47.875
It's warm in here. Are you warm?

15:47.959 --> 15:50.417
I do not want you perspiring. Fan her.

15:57.625 --> 15:58.959
Okay. Um...

16:00.291 --> 16:02.959
Mitch, he's not doing it right.
I want you to fan me.

16:03.041 --> 16:04.125
Oh, actually--

16:04.208 --> 16:06.375
I'm the princess. Fan me, rich.

16:06.458 --> 16:09.083
- It's Mitch.
- Wrong! Now fan me.

16:11.583 --> 16:14.041
- How's this?
- Don't look at me.

16:15.625 --> 16:17.542
- Teddy, what are you doing?
- Silence.

16:19.083 --> 16:21.000
Um, can you just eat the chicken now?

16:21.083 --> 16:22.333
Fine!

16:24.041 --> 16:26.458
Mmm! Oh, that's awful!

16:29.291 --> 16:32.500
She means awful good.

16:34.709 --> 16:35.750
Ugh!

16:36.125 --> 16:37.875
How can you people eat this stuff?

16:37.959 --> 16:40.083
They should call this place "Icky-Chikki."

16:42.208 --> 16:43.750
Get out! You're fired!

16:45.500 --> 16:49.458
Oh, oh, oh, oh!
And FYI, number three is horse meat.

16:49.542 --> 16:50.542
Okay, buddy?

16:51.709 --> 16:53.250
And delicious.

16:54.959 --> 16:56.542
And half off.

17:02.041 --> 17:03.291
Hey, Dad.

17:04.166 --> 17:05.709
You're still in your bathrobe.

17:05.792 --> 17:08.709
- Why aren't you dressed?
- What's the point?

17:09.834 --> 17:11.208
Shouldn't you be at work?

17:11.291 --> 17:14.291
There is no work. I quit my job.

17:14.375 --> 17:15.542
Wait, what?

17:15.625 --> 17:17.875
Look, if I can't catch a little mouse,

17:17.959 --> 17:21.458
then I don't deserve
to call myself an exterminator.

17:26.291 --> 17:27.709
I'm sorry.

17:29.250 --> 17:30.750
I'm a failure.

17:32.166 --> 17:34.000
No, Dad. You're not a failure.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.250
You caught the mouse the first night.

17:36.375 --> 17:39.417
I was pranking you. I'm so sorry.

17:40.875 --> 17:42.792
I didn't mean for you to quit your job.

17:50.542 --> 17:51.959
I got ya!

17:53.458 --> 17:56.208
- What?
- I've been pranking you.

17:56.792 --> 17:58.792
- No way.
- Yeah, way.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.041
How'd you figure it out?

18:02.125 --> 18:04.709
I told you, I'm an expert
at animal behavior.

18:05.625 --> 18:07.458
All right, I saw you let the mouse go.

18:09.458 --> 18:11.917
So that thing you did
with the mouse traps,

18:12.000 --> 18:13.125
you did that on purpose?

18:14.542 --> 18:17.041
Yes, I did that on purpose.

18:20.792 --> 18:23.250
You can't prank me, I prank you.

18:23.375 --> 18:25.208
- That's how it works.
- Oh, no.

18:25.291 --> 18:26.959
That's how it used to work.

18:28.417 --> 18:31.208
Hey, how does it feel to be
on the other side?

18:34.875 --> 18:36.625
I don't know who I am anymore.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.333
Walking dogs again?

18:46.458 --> 18:48.083
Uh, yeah.

18:48.166 --> 18:50.333
Well, I gotta get that phone somehow.

18:50.375 --> 18:52.750
And it beats working
at Kwikki Chikki, so...

18:52.834 --> 18:55.125
By the way, thanks.

18:55.208 --> 18:56.250
For what?

18:56.667 --> 18:58.875
For going all diva
and getting fired on purpose.

18:59.500 --> 19:00.709
It meant a lot to me.

19:00.792 --> 19:02.709
I don't know what you're talking about?

19:03.166 --> 19:05.083
Come on. Didn't you throw
that tantrum just to help me?

19:05.667 --> 19:07.000
Doesn't sound like me.

19:08.834 --> 19:12.166
Okay, well, however you want to play it,

19:12.250 --> 19:13.333
I owe you a solid.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.125
Here.

19:15.208 --> 19:16.709
This is mostly solid.

19:18.875 --> 19:20.542
Oh, look at that.

19:20.625 --> 19:22.500
Your brother and sister are sharing.

19:25.667 --> 19:28.125
Hey, how was "Music and Me"?

19:28.917 --> 19:30.083
Fine.

19:31.709 --> 19:34.417
Listen, could you take Charlie
to class next time?

19:34.500 --> 19:36.709
And all the other times after that?

19:38.250 --> 19:39.542
What happened?

19:40.000 --> 19:41.417
There was a little misunderstanding.

19:42.417 --> 19:45.250
Apparently, the "Me" in "Music and Me"

19:45.333 --> 19:47.500
isn't... me.

19:54.709 --> 19:56.834
Hey, Charlie. It's me, PJ.

19:56.917 --> 19:59.458
I'm taking over Teddy's video diary
to tell you that,

19:59.542 --> 20:01.250
even though she didn't want to admit it,

20:01.333 --> 20:03.583
she did something really
nice for me today.

20:04.542 --> 20:07.375
I guess sometimes we really
do care about each other.

20:07.458 --> 20:10.000
Who knows, maybe this is
the start of a whole new--

20:10.083 --> 20:11.500
PJ, what are you doing with my camera?

20:11.583 --> 20:13.375
- I'm talking to Charlie.
- Give me that.

20:13.458 --> 20:15.959
- No, I'm not, I'm not done yet!
- Oh, yes you are.

20:16.041 --> 20:19.000
Wait. Here. With a sister like this...
good luck, Charlie.

20:19.083 --> 20:20.959
Hey, I say that!

20:21.709 --> 20:23.125
Good luck, Charlie.

20:34.291 --> 20:36.625
Oh. Hi.

20:37.041 --> 20:38.041
Hello.

20:38.667 --> 20:41.291
Look, Elaine, I probably
owe you an apology.

20:42.208 --> 20:44.709
I mean, making a competition
out of singing nursery rhymes,

20:44.792 --> 20:46.041
that's, that's ridiculous.

20:46.125 --> 20:49.041
Well, no apology necessary.
I can be very competitive.

20:49.125 --> 20:51.166
Oh, believe me, no one's more
competitive than me.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.709
I was voted most competitive
at competition school.

20:55.333 --> 20:56.917
- May I take your order?
- Yes.
