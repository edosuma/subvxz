13:28.850 --> 13:30.057
what I find interesting

13:34.439 --> 13:36.431

Hey.
- Hey.

15:34.475 --> 15:36.717
You OK?
- Mm.

15:36.769 --> 15:37.976
Hm.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.930
I was just thinking about my dad.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.848
You know, erm,
what you said.

15:43.693 --> 15:46.060
How can I not have known, you know?
- Mm.

15:47.155 --> 15:49.192
The thing is, with my dad

15:49.240 --> 15:52.529
he's always had
such an easy presence.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.613
I mean, always.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.204
You know, the only time
I've ever seen him upset

16:00.084 --> 16:02.076
was when my sister Puli
got married.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.587
And everyone cries at weddings,
don't they?

16:07.592 --> 16:09.333
As you will very soon find out.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.094
Oh, come on.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.598
Don't you try and back out now.

16:16.642 --> 16:19.009
'Cause you said yes.
You're stuck with me now.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.688

- Good.

16:23.733 --> 16:26.316
'Cause as soon as my parents
are back from India

16:26.360 --> 16:27.692
there's no waiting for
the right moment.

16:27.737 --> 16:29.603
I'm just... I'm just gonna say to Mum

16:29.655 --> 16:32.773
'We're getting married and that's it.'
- Right.

16:37.955 --> 16:39.162
Go on.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.199
This thing with your dad.

16:43.127 --> 16:44.584
It's a big deal...

16:44.629 --> 16:46.336

- So...

16:49.008 --> 16:50.590
Give it its due.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.543
Deal with one thing at a time.

16:56.390 --> 16:59.224
And just a question.
- Mm-hmm?

17:00.102 --> 17:03.516
When you do tell them, do you really
want to hit them

17:03.564 --> 17:05.896
straight off with,
'We're getting married'?

17:06.733 --> 17:10.522
Maybe just introduce
the idea of me first.

17:11.614 --> 17:12.730
Yeah?

17:20.540 --> 17:21.701
Can I just say that

17:21.749 --> 17:23.490
that's why you're going
to get that promotion.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.413
Hm?
- Yeah.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.874

I've got a meeting.

- Just popping round the shop.

20:52.126 --> 20:53.082
Laura.

20:53.127 --> 20:54.868
You just told someone
I don't exist.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.502
No...
- What do you mean, no?

20:56.547 --> 20:58.334
It was my auntie.
I was ambushed.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.214
I had to say that.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.467
Otherwise it'd spread like wildfire

21:02.511 --> 21:05.800

that way.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.931
It just can't.

- Not to me.

I'm gonna tell my mum and I am.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.483

21:19.987 --> 21:23.856

- And you didn't tell me?

21:25.075 --> 21:27.533
It's delicate. That's all.

21:27.578 --> 21:30.286
It's about doing it right. Yeah?

21:30.331 --> 21:34.120
I have 54 first cousins

I know this.

21:36.420 --> 21:39.003
Yeah, and I'm the one
who's going to break ranks.

I'll be the first, Laura.

21:41.592 --> 21:45.051
I mean, it's possible and probable
I'll be disowned.

21:45.095 --> 21:48.133
What, so, you'll never tell them
about me because...

21:48.933 --> 21:50.219
you can't.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.268
You'll just live two separate lives.

I have not seen you before.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.222
Your sisters and brother, yes,
but not you.

28:08.270 --> 28:09.431
I live in London.

28:09.479 --> 28:13.439
I just wanted to know a bit more
about my father's, erm, condition.

28:13.483 --> 28:15.475
Yes, no problem, no problem.

28:24.995 --> 28:29.490

28:29.541 --> 28:32.158
Ah, and these are for
his mental health problems.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.669
Your father is on Quetiapine.

28:34.713 --> 28:37.922
And a monthly injection
of Modecate.

28:37.966 --> 28:40.128
Injections?
- DOCTOR CHUCKLES

28:40.177 --> 28:42.794
Your father is not so reliable
when it comes to taking his medicines

28:42.846 --> 28:47.011
so it's just a backup to ensure he doesn't
deteriorate beyond a certain point.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.175
Jagjit...

29:07.579 --> 29:10.242
And, erm, I can make the sun rise

and both the countries are friends,
I know that.

29:12.376 --> 29:13.742
Thank you very much.

29:16.463 --> 29:17.920
DOCTOR:
Are you alright?

29:19.967 --> 29:21.799
Yeah.

29:21.843 --> 29:24.586
I've just never seen him
so animated.

29:24.638 --> 29:27.221
At home, he just, you know,
reads the newspaper

29:27.266 --> 29:31.510
or watches the Shopping Channel,
I mean, obsessively.

29:31.561 --> 29:34.304
He may think it's talking to him
or about him.

29:34.815 --> 29:37.102
But if he's becoming delusional,
let's nip it in the bud.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.688
We'll increase his dose.
- Don't... don't do it on my say-so.

29:39.736 --> 29:41.853
Ah, please, I've been monitoring
him for some time.

29:41.905 --> 29:43.897
I think it'll be good to
increase a little.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.191

29:57.296 --> 29:58.912
but we'll just double the dosage.

30:06.013 --> 30:07.470
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

30:08.598 --> 30:12.012
You should know that your father
is only doing as well as he is

30:12.060 --> 30:13.096
because of your mother.

30:13.145 --> 30:16.138
She enables him to remain at home.

30:16.189 --> 30:18.226
Although, and I say this
with some pride

30:18.275 --> 30:21.689
Indian families cope because
the entire family rallies around.

30:21.737 --> 30:26.107
I promise you, 95 out of 100
people like your father

30:26.158 --> 30:29.617
would be in a nursing home by now,
and a closed unit, at that.

30:30.871 --> 30:32.453
Try not to worry.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.204
Continuity is everything.

30:34.249 --> 30:36.241
It's change that causes the problems.

30:36.293 --> 30:38.330
Change can throw him off balance.

30:38.378 --> 30:42.167
But, well, since we have seen
no aggression for many years and...

30:42.215 --> 30:45.458
What, aggression?
What do you mean, aggression?

30:45.510 --> 30:49.003
No, I mean, he's...
- Please, remember what I said.

30:49.848 --> 30:53.216
Let us not be at loggerheads.
- Oh, he's used to people arguing.

30:53.268 --> 30:54.975
But not you with me.

30:56.063 --> 30:57.395
So...

31:01.902 --> 31:03.814
DOCTOR: Jagjit...
- Not to worry.

31:04.404 --> 31:05.895

Yes, he was different.

And, of course, he takes it out

It was, er, around then
that some people

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.657
started saying he'd gone mad.

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:09.658
SHARANJIT:
Who said that?

01:03:09.703 --> 01:03:11.740
We never said that and
we never would.

01:03:11.788 --> 01:03:13.279

They were right, though, weren't they?

01:03:13.331 --> 01:03:14.538

What do you mean?

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:16.032
SATHNAM:
Auntie, something went wrong with his mind.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:17.291
He became ill.

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:19.327
SHARANJIT: Yes, well, everything
got better when you arrived.

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:21.166
SATHNAM:
No, it was nothing to do with me.

01:03:21.214 --> 01:03:22.750
SHARANJIT:
Yes, when you were born.

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:24.711
When you arrived,
from then he got better.

01:03:24.759 --> 01:03:26.671
You changed everything.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:28.928
SATHNAM:
It was the medicine that made him better.

01:03:28.972 --> 01:03:31.134
The medication he was on.
It was nothing to do with me.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:34.808
Well, you should also know...

01:03:34.853 --> 01:03:37.311
a lot of people think maybe
your mum does something.

01:03:38.773 --> 01:03:39.809
No, I have to say this.

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:41.770
SATHNAM: Does something?
- SHARANJIT: Yes.

01:03:41.818 --> 01:03:43.605

Mum is the only reason my dad survived.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.751
Why do Indians always need
to blame someone?

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:04.835
It's an illness. Just an illness.

01:04:17.979 --> 01:04:21.689
This illness you speak of...
- SATHNAM: Schizophrenia.

01:04:21.733 --> 01:04:25.818
Ah, yes, er, it affects
young people?

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:27.899
That's when it often sets in, yes.

01:04:27.947 --> 01:04:31.031
And it runs in the family?
- It can, yes.

01:04:32.118 --> 01:04:35.282
So, is that what your sister has?

01:04:37.665 --> 01:04:39.406
Is that what Puli has, too?

01:04:46.383 --> 01:04:47.794
It is, yeah.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:10.566
Hi.
- Sathnam.

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:13.732
Yeah, good.
- You never come in!

01:05:13.785 --> 01:05:16.528
Hey, shush!
- Oh, hello.

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.161
How are you?
- OK.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.498
Is Puli in?
- Yes, of course.

01:05:21.543 --> 01:05:22.784
Oh, Puli!

01:05:29.467 --> 01:05:30.708
Can we talk?

01:05:53.116 --> 01:05:54.448
Sorry.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.618
I find it easier to write things down.

01:06:00.540 --> 01:06:01.781
Here.

01:06:03.585 --> 01:06:05.167
Do you want me to read it?

01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:11.841
'Sathnam's been asking Mum
the same questions I asked once.

01:06:14.095 --> 01:06:15.927
He wants to know what happened.

01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:18.597
He's like me, very like me.

01:06:18.641 --> 01:06:21.258
We might've been the same
if things were different.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:25.104
I was clever, too, but as soon
as I started to get ill

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.559
I slowed down.

01:06:26.608 --> 01:06:29.772
And once I was on medication, I...'
- No.

01:06:29.819 --> 01:06:31.902
Just the first bit.
- No, it's so true.

01:06:33.281 --> 01:06:34.897
Yeah.
- I was cleverer than you.

01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:36.190
SATHNAM CHUCKLES
You are cleverer.

01:06:47.128 --> 01:06:48.664
HE SIGHS

01:06:53.468 --> 01:06:55.710
Er, I've been, er...

01:06:56.804 --> 01:07:00.297
very wrapped up in myself.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:06.221
Er, in my work and in
my life in London.

01:07:06.272 --> 01:07:08.434
Too... too wrapped up in...

01:07:10.735 --> 01:07:13.569
And I want to be a better brother.

01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:17.864
Uh, yeah.

01:07:21.663 --> 01:07:28.411
You know how
spice capsules separate

01:07:29.087 --> 01:07:31.044
and are on their own?

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:36.796
I'm apart.

01:07:40.640 --> 01:07:42.927
I punch pillows sometimes.

01:07:44.894 --> 01:07:48.934
I can't help thinking my life
could've gone a different way.

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:50.598
Yeah, it could have.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.892
And I still try. I'm not lazy.

01:07:52.944 --> 01:07:55.106
I've never stopped having goals.

01:08:01.035 --> 01:08:02.196
WOMAN HUMS

01:08:02.245 --> 01:08:04.703
PULI:
Do you know when I knew how ill I was?

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:10.785
It was when I was first sectioned.

01:08:18.136 --> 01:08:19.752
You looked disgusted.

01:08:31.274 --> 01:08:32.560
AMBULANCE DOORS SHUT

01:08:34.359 --> 01:08:35.942
AMBULANCE ENGINE STARTS

01:08:39.948 --> 01:08:42.157
PULI:
Mum says that was the day

01:08:42.201 --> 01:08:43.908
you went and had your
topknot cut off.

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:48.615
She said that was the day
she knew you would leave us.

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:19.353
Puli...

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:26.238
I'm so sorry.

01:09:28.456 --> 01:09:31.493
I don't know why, but I need you
to know how I feel.

01:09:33.544 --> 01:09:36.127
You more than anyone, I think

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:39.832
because we are almost the same.

01:09:40.426 --> 01:09:41.667
It's like...

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:43.176

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:54.939

CAROL: And why would you ask that?
- Have you?

01:13:07.258 --> 01:13:09.545
Would you like to tell us...
- Yes, just show it off.

01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:12.462
INDISTINCT CHATTER

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:18.099
OK.

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:23.939
Laura.

01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:27.143
Sathnam.

01:13:27.194 --> 01:13:29.151
I just want to say congratulations.

01:13:29.196 --> 01:13:31.404
I mean, I assume you got
that promotion.

01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:34.613
Sathnam, don't let Greg see you.
Where's the Ferrari?

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:35.821
It's... it's outside.

01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:37.987
They've reported it stolen.

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:40.531
And you've been sacked.

01:13:43.961 --> 01:13:46.328
Congratulations again.
You deserve it.

01:14:19.872 --> 01:14:21.363
Hello. Alright?

01:14:21.415 --> 01:14:23.077

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:27.418
SATHNAM:
Sit down, sit down.

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.582
Press play and watch the DVD.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:34.463
Because I'm asking you to.

You understand?

01:18:04.180 --> 01:18:06.012
Mum, have you watched it?

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:10.009
Yes, watched enough.
- No, no, no.

01:18:10.060 --> 01:18:12.302
Yes.
- No, watch it all.

01:18:12.354 --> 01:18:13.936
Watch all of it.

01:18:13.939 --> 01:18:16.147
Come on, this is important.
I made this for you.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.524
Sit down.

01:18:18.861 --> 01:18:23.356
And how much... it cost,
this translate?

01:18:23.407 --> 01:18:25.273
If you must know, £300.

01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:31.196
Watch it. Watch it.

01:18:35.836 --> 01:18:37.418
Waste of money.

THUNDER RUMBLES

01:19:53.872 --> 01:19:57.491
You've seen it all now, right?
- Hm. Yes.

01:19:58.585 --> 01:20:00.451
So my girlfriend's name was...?

01:20:02.214 --> 01:20:03.830
Mum, what was her name?

01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:05.168
Laura.

01:20:05.926 --> 01:20:07.508
Thank you.

01:20:11.598 --> 01:20:13.931
<i>But you have now split, huna?</i>

01:20:22.735 --> 01:20:24.727
No, no, no, Mum, Mum, listen...

01:20:25.612 --> 01:20:26.693
Look at me.

01:20:27.489 --> 01:20:28.730
Look at me.

01:20:33.787 --> 01:20:36.951
I love you, Mum.
I love you.

01:20:38.709 --> 01:20:40.371
And I loved Laura.

01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:42.411
I still do, I love her.

01:20:46.216 --> 01:20:48.424
We were going to get married
and have children.

01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.052
But she's gone.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:57.176
And she's gone because
I wanted your blessing, Mum.

01:20:58.479 --> 01:21:00.721
<i>I needed your blessing.</i>

01:21:01.065 --> 01:21:02.351
We both did.

01:21:04.693 --> 01:21:07.777
I just... I couldn't ask,
I was too scared.

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.363
You know, I want to have

01:21:14.411 --> 01:21:18.325
one joined-up life with no fear
and no more lies.

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:20.991
I need you to be a part of that.
Do you understand?

01:21:32.805 --> 01:21:34.137
Yes.

01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:41.595
SHE SIGHS

01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:51.112
She's a dentist.

01:21:51.615 --> 01:21:53.322
She's so pretty.

01:21:54.701 --> 01:21:58.160
She looks just like Kylie Minogue.
- Right, I'm off.

01:22:06.797 --> 01:22:10.541
Right, Dedi, I'm going.

01:23:15.908 --> 01:23:21.074
Well, I'm... I'm up in Wolves
and, erm...

01:23:27.294 --> 01:23:29.627
I just... I just told my mum
everything

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:31.663
and it was, erm...

HE CHUCKLES

01:23:37.721 --> 01:23:39.303
I did it.

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:42.097
I actually did it.

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:47.304

brave enough sooner.

Sathnam.

01:24:02.746 --> 01:24:06.740
I, erm, found this in the office

01:24:06.792 --> 01:24:10.502
and I saw my name.

01:24:12.506 --> 01:24:13.963
Five times.

01:24:15.384 --> 01:24:17.967
So, eventually guessed.

01:24:18.011 --> 01:24:22.096
But it... it's all in Punjabi.
- Oh, yeah, no.

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:25.266
I put it into Google Translate.

01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:27.017
Which gives the gist.

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:31.227
Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:24:34.695 --> 01:24:36.357
I as, er...

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:41.275
I as good as run away,
you know?

01:24:42.619 --> 01:24:44.781
Cut my topknot off and left.

01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:47.447
You were right. I was hiding.

01:24:48.584 --> 01:24:50.075
You're back now, though.

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:53.832
I told my mum I'd wanted to marry you.

01:25:13.775 --> 01:25:16.233
And I also said I wish she'd met you.

01:25:17.821 --> 01:25:21.405
And since you're here,
you know, maybe...

01:25:21.450 --> 01:25:23.191
Do you fancy it?
