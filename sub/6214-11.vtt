00:04.872 --> 00:07.534
Whoa, did you just sigh,
or are you sitting on an accordion?

00:07.708 --> 00:10.643
- I think I see a gray hair.
- What?

00:10.811 --> 00:12.745
Darn, you know,
I knew this job would age me.

00:12.913 --> 00:15.575
You know, I am two weeks away
from a blue rinse and bunion pads.

00:15.749 --> 00:18.183
The gray hair is on me.

00:18.352 --> 00:20.650
Don't you think of anyone
besides yourself?

00:20.821 --> 00:23.722
Of course I do. Right now,
I'm thinking of Daniel Bedingfield.

00:23.891 --> 00:26.724
<i>I'm doing the cover story on him
for this issue of Scorch magazine.</i>

00:26.894 --> 00:29.021
Do you know
what a big responsibility this is?

00:29.196 --> 00:31.391
Wow, you've never had
a cover before.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.966
<i>Except for that phony Time Magazine
one you got at the county fair.</i>

00:35.136 --> 00:39.095
Hey, I learned to ride a two-wheeler.
I totally deserved woman of the year.

00:39.707 --> 00:42.107
- Hey.
- Sorry, I'm in a rush.

00:42.276 --> 00:44.244
The radio station's general manager
is in town.

00:44.411 --> 00:47.608
Okay, this time no matter how good
the toupee looks, do not ask if it's new.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.846
Hey, I was doing him a favor.
There was a price tag hanging off of it.

00:51.519 --> 00:53.953
Sabrina,
will you open my mail for me?

00:54.121 --> 00:56.146
<i>I sent my fashion portfolio
to LaRue magazine,</i>

00:56.323 --> 00:58.848
and I am too nervous
to read their response.

00:59.026 --> 01:00.050
Look at these stamps.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.525
I don't think they'd spend
three 97 on a rejection letter.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.288
Yes. Goody, goody, goody.

01:04.465 --> 01:06.194
Unless they're sending back
your portfolio.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.358
Baddy, baddy, baddy.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.936
Hey, Morgan, these are really good.

01:11.105 --> 01:14.165
Okay, it says here
that they like your stuff,

01:14.341 --> 01:17.105
they just want you come back
when you've had more experience.

01:17.278 --> 01:18.870
That's why I hate careers.

01:19.046 --> 01:21.879
It was so much easier
getting experience with boys.

01:22.049 --> 01:23.573
See you, guys.

01:24.952 --> 01:27.716
Seriously, Morgan,
you're gonna find work soon. I know it.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.890
Thanks. Okay, I feel better.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.918
It is so great to have roommates
who think I'm talented.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.188
- You are.
- And beautiful.

01:37.364 --> 01:39.924
- Absolutely.
- And smart.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.697
Oh, is that a gray hair on Salem?

01:42.870 --> 01:43.996
Oh.

01:45.000 --> 01:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.781 --> 02:28.180
What are you so happy about?

02:28.349 --> 02:30.442
Well, let's see. I got here early.

02:30.618 --> 02:31.812
I found a great parking spot.

02:31.986 --> 02:34.386
And the guy at the coffee stand
didn't call me, "Peaches. "

02:34.556 --> 02:36.888
So it has nothing to do with you
getting the cover story?

02:37.058 --> 02:39.083
Oh, are you upset about that?

02:39.260 --> 02:40.352
No, of course not.

02:40.528 --> 02:43.258
It's just, you know,
doing a cover's a big responsibility.

02:43.665 --> 02:46.759
I should know,
I've written too many to count. Ha, ha.

02:46.935 --> 02:48.994
Nine of the last 13.

02:49.604 --> 02:51.265
Well, I got this cover.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.737
- Sabrina, you lost the cover.
- What?

02:54.409 --> 02:57.003
Well, make that ten of, uh, 14.

02:57.178 --> 02:58.805
But I'll let you proof read it, Peaches.

02:58.980 --> 03:01.972
Unh, Annie, Annie,
you can't take this story from me.

03:02.150 --> 03:03.549
I already told my cat.

03:03.718 --> 03:05.345
I'm sorry.
I just heard from the designer.

03:05.520 --> 03:07.454
He refuses
to dress Daniel Bedingfield.

03:07.622 --> 03:09.112
- Why?
- I don't know.

03:09.290 --> 03:11.383
- Maybe he doesn't like the British.
- Who doesn't?

03:11.559 --> 03:14.494
You know, sure, they used to have
a Navy and attack people all the time.

03:14.662 --> 03:17.426
But now they just make tea and jam
and long boring movies.

03:17.599 --> 03:18.930
I'm sorry. No designer, no cover.

03:19.100 --> 03:22.433
You see, the problem is, Boston's
not really known for its designers.

03:22.604 --> 03:24.595
Except for the dude who invented
the tri-corner hat.

03:25.039 --> 03:27.132
Wait, wait,
what about Morgan Cavenaugh?

03:27.308 --> 03:28.832
- Who?
- Morgan Cavanaugh, my friend.

03:29.010 --> 03:31.274
Oh, well, in that case, no.

03:31.446 --> 03:33.243
But you haven't even
seen her portfolio.

03:44.826 --> 03:48.557
Maybe I shouldn't inhale
when I use that hairspray.

03:48.763 --> 03:53.223
I just happen to have
Morgan's portfolio right here. Ha, ha.

03:53.401 --> 03:56.495
I'm telling you,
she is hot, hot, hot right now.

03:56.671 --> 03:59.834
<i>I mean,
LaRue magazine just contacted her.</i>

04:00.575 --> 04:03.669
It's not bad, but I hate to give the cover
to someone I've never heard of.

04:03.845 --> 04:05.472
Come on, you never heard of me.

04:05.647 --> 04:07.774
Well, that's not your best argument.

04:08.850 --> 04:10.613
Annie, I tell you, she's really good.

04:10.785 --> 04:13.015
Hmm, guess I don't have much
of a choice. I'm desperate.

04:13.187 --> 04:15.121
Oh, she's gonna be so happy
to hear that.

04:15.590 --> 04:17.750
Well, I might edit it a little.

04:22.397 --> 04:24.524
Salem. You're dying your hair?

04:24.699 --> 04:26.929
I'm just putting in some low-lights.

04:27.101 --> 04:29.501
Oh, I had no idea
they made a "Just for Cats. "

04:29.671 --> 04:32.196
I had no idea
how many shades of black there were.

04:32.373 --> 04:34.773
I finally went with ultimate goulet.

04:35.877 --> 04:37.242
Hi, Sabrina.

04:37.412 --> 04:39.437
Oh, what is going on with the cat?

04:39.614 --> 04:44.677
Oh, that, well, uh, I am not gonna color
my hair without practicing first.

04:45.186 --> 04:47.086
Oh, great idea.

04:47.755 --> 04:50.280
Later, I think I'll try my new home
bikini waxer on him.

04:53.227 --> 04:54.717
Listen, Morgan, I've got great news.

04:54.896 --> 04:56.295
Oh, you found my briefcase.

04:56.464 --> 04:59.592
Yeah, uh, when I took it to work
by mistake, lucky for you,

04:59.767 --> 05:01.359
guess what Bedingfield's
gonna be wearing

05:01.536 --> 05:02.969
<i>on the cover of Scorch magazine?</i>

05:03.404 --> 05:06.396
Well, he's British so...

05:06.574 --> 05:07.871
Oh, Lederhosen.

05:08.042 --> 05:10.237
No, he's wearing Morganwear.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.709
I showed Annie your portfolio
and got you the job.

05:12.880 --> 05:13.938
You're kidding?

05:14.115 --> 05:16.174
Annie really wants me
to style the cover?

05:16.618 --> 05:17.949
Wants? She said it herself.

05:18.119 --> 05:19.245
She's desperate.

05:19.420 --> 05:23.151
Oh, my God, Sabrina, thank you
so much for doing this for me.

05:23.324 --> 05:25.554
- What's going on?
- Roxie, great news.

05:25.727 --> 05:27.661
I am going to be styling
Daniel Bedingfield

05:27.829 --> 05:29.922
<i>for the cover of Scorch magazine.</i>

05:30.098 --> 05:32.726
Good for you, at least things
are going well for you guys.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.731
Oh, they really are, thanks.

05:35.169 --> 05:37.694
Hold it, Morgan.
Roxie, what happened?

05:38.339 --> 05:40.432
My station manager
isn't happy with my show.

05:40.608 --> 05:42.235
He said he's tired of girl talk.

05:42.944 --> 05:45.037
Whoa, that's awful.

05:45.213 --> 05:46.510
Here I get this great news

05:46.681 --> 05:48.672
and then you come in
and just bring us down.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.782
Morgan.
Look, it's not the end of the world.

05:51.953 --> 05:54.421
You could just change
the format of your show.

05:54.589 --> 05:57.057
You know, instead of girl talk,
it could be guy talk.

05:57.225 --> 05:59.750
You know like, uh,
"That's a big one, Mark. "

05:59.927 --> 06:02.225
"Yeah, you totally blew that carburetor,
Pete. "

06:03.331 --> 06:06.027
I thought people loved my show.
You guys like it, right?

06:06.200 --> 06:07.997
Of course we do.
We listen to it every night.

06:08.169 --> 06:11.764
Well, sure, but mostly with the sound
turned down so I can hear Conan.

06:12.473 --> 06:14.532
Don't listen to her. We're huge fans.

06:14.709 --> 06:17.269
What would you have told that woman
last night from Framingham?

06:17.779 --> 06:23.718
Oh, well, I would have told her
to dump that loser.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.415
Her husband just died.

06:26.187 --> 06:29.679
Oh, well,
then all the more reason to let go.

06:30.725 --> 06:33.922
There are things you could do with
the radio show. You could do music...

06:34.095 --> 06:35.357
I want my show to remain a place

06:35.530 --> 06:37.088
where women
can express themselves.

06:37.265 --> 06:40.166
Then you better get some
good-looking guys on your show.

06:40.334 --> 06:41.596
Why don't you go wax the cat?

06:41.769 --> 06:43.327
<i>Oh, yes.</i>

06:43.938 --> 06:46.338
I don't know, maybe I should think
about doing something else.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.771
No, Roxie, your show is great.

06:48.943 --> 06:51.377
You know, but maybe
there's something to that music idea.

06:51.546 --> 06:54.379
You know, maybe you could
mix your message with live music.

06:54.549 --> 06:58.280
Live music, that's a great idea.
Thanks, Sabrina.

07:00.688 --> 07:01.916
What was that?

07:02.090 --> 07:04.285
The sound of a cat
who's gonna look good in a bikini.

07:07.295 --> 07:10.696
Oh, I'm sure Morgan
will be here any minute now.

07:10.865 --> 07:15.268
She's in the fashion business,
so she's fashionably late. Ha, ha.

07:17.171 --> 07:18.866
Any minute now.

07:19.373 --> 07:21.705
- I don't like waiting.
Me, neither.

07:21.876 --> 07:23.776
I once dumped a girl
for making me wait.

07:23.945 --> 07:25.674
After two hours,
I just paid the minister,

07:25.847 --> 07:28.748
sent the guests home and took
the maid of honor on a honeymoon.

07:29.751 --> 07:32.549
Annie, you know if you need it, you
can use, uh, my story as the cover.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.211
Whoa, back in your tree limb, vulture,
this one isn't dead yet.

07:35.389 --> 07:38.381
No, seriously, I'm doing that interview
with Ozzy Osbourne tomorrow.

07:38.559 --> 07:43.326
The only thing is, I gotta figure out
what time, uh... o'clock is.

07:44.098 --> 07:47.158
If I know Morgan, she's just taking
a few extra seconds to...

07:47.335 --> 07:50.702
You know, prepare herself
for a professional presentation.

07:55.643 --> 07:58.703
Hey, quit your honking,
we're not going anywhere.

08:06.621 --> 08:07.952
Hello?

08:08.122 --> 08:10.090
You were to be here 20 minutes ago.
Where are you?

08:10.258 --> 08:11.919
Duh, shopping.

08:12.093 --> 08:13.651
I wanted to look good
for this meeting.

08:13.828 --> 08:15.159
Well, get here now.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.559
I can't go any faster.

08:17.999 --> 08:19.762
Oh, yes, you can.

08:22.403 --> 08:24.871
Whoa, this car goes fast.

08:25.039 --> 08:28.702
Look, I can't wait any longer.
Cole, let's run your story.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.508
Wait, she's here.

08:35.917 --> 08:37.407
Hi.

08:38.486 --> 08:41.614
- Am I late?
- Whoa, rad do.

08:41.789 --> 08:44.622
Thanks. Rad do to you too.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.986
Don't worry, she won't be doing hair.

08:49.664 --> 08:52.360
Okay, I have so many great ideas
for this cover.

08:52.533 --> 08:55.696
I want to put Daniel in something
that makes a bold statement.

08:55.870 --> 08:57.895
You want something bold?
Try showing up on time.

08:58.072 --> 08:59.664
Unh, that is so done.

09:00.074 --> 09:01.939
Okay, I gotta go get started
on this article.

09:02.109 --> 09:04.304
You know, this cover
is a big break for me too.

09:04.478 --> 09:06.810
If I do well,
Annie might stop calling me the temp.

09:08.416 --> 09:11.351
Hey,
does Salem look different to you?

09:14.755 --> 09:18.088
No, he looks exactly the same.

09:18.259 --> 09:20.227
Maybe he's facing a different way.

09:22.663 --> 09:23.857
What have you done?

09:24.031 --> 09:27.159
I figured the dye job wasn't enough
to make me look younger,

09:27.335 --> 09:30.031
so for 5 bucks they threw in
a little collagen.

09:30.204 --> 09:31.228
A little?

09:31.405 --> 09:34.238
It looks like you made out
with a beehive.

09:37.178 --> 09:39.976
Roxie, if you don't mind, I'm gonna
borrow your Daniel Bedingfield CD.

09:40.147 --> 09:43.173
Sure. You have a minute? I'm working
on a song and like to run it by you.

09:43.351 --> 09:45.512
Oh, well, okay.

09:45.987 --> 09:47.978
<i>Boston ladies sing this song</i>

09:48.155 --> 09:49.679
<i>Doo-dah, doo-dah</i>

09:49.857 --> 09:51.984
<i>We get paid less for the same job</i>

09:52.593 --> 09:54.925
- You think this is good?
- Well, no, but I think...

09:55.096 --> 09:56.654
So, what do you think?

09:56.831 --> 09:57.923
Oh, it's great.

09:58.766 --> 10:02.463
Roxie, they say that everyone
is given a special gift.

10:02.637 --> 10:06.437
If music is yours,
I hope you saved the receipt.

10:06.607 --> 10:09.940
Oh, Rox, don't listen to her, uh.
What does she know about music?

10:10.111 --> 10:11.772
She thought B flat was a bra size.

10:12.213 --> 10:13.578
So you really like it?

10:13.748 --> 10:15.739
Yeah, it's fantastic.

10:15.917 --> 10:18.943
I wish I could listen to the rest,
but I gotta go prepare for this interview.

10:19.120 --> 10:20.519
But keep it up.

10:20.821 --> 10:22.652
<i>Healthy people don't eat meat</i>

10:24.692 --> 10:26.717
Daniel's only gonna give me
a little bit of time.

10:26.894 --> 10:29.260
I have to boil this down
to the best 75 questions.

10:29.430 --> 10:31.591
Now, do you think it's possible
to be over-prepared?

10:31.766 --> 10:33.791
Oh, good one. Seventy-six.

10:34.235 --> 10:37.864
All right, I figured we would set up
with the bakery in the background.

10:38.039 --> 10:40.200
- That cool with you?
- I see what you're going for.

10:40.374 --> 10:42.899
Interesting light,
kind of a European feel?

10:43.077 --> 10:44.772
No. There's an outlet there.

10:46.147 --> 10:47.944
Hey, is Daniel here yet?

10:48.115 --> 10:50.948
Yeah, he's in your office with Morgan.
She's putting together his look.

10:51.118 --> 10:53.780
There is a naked rock star in my office
and I'm not there?

10:53.955 --> 10:55.013
I hate what I've become.

10:56.724 --> 10:59.625
Oh, Annie, I know that this cover story
is an awesome opportunity,

10:59.794 --> 11:02.024
I hope it'll inspire you to give me
more responsibility...

11:02.196 --> 11:06.030
Did you hear me?
There is a naked rock star in my office.

11:06.200 --> 11:12.161
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present Daniel Bedingfield.

11:16.077 --> 11:18.910
- Well, what do you think?
- Oh, my gosh, it's awful.

11:19.080 --> 11:20.570
- What do we do?
- We do nothing.

11:20.982 --> 11:23.382
You want more responsibility,
fire your friend.

11:33.728 --> 11:35.923
- Listen, Morgan.
- Did you see those people?

11:36.097 --> 11:37.587
I stunned them.

11:38.933 --> 11:41.197
I totally get what you mean
about Annie.

11:41.369 --> 11:43.667
I am too important
to give a compliment.

11:43.838 --> 11:47.330
I mean, you think somebody
is maybe a little intimidated

11:47.508 --> 11:49.476
by something called talent?

11:50.044 --> 11:51.068
You know, you're right.

11:51.245 --> 11:54.237
And that's probably why
she's insisting on

11:54.415 --> 11:55.882
going a different way with the cover.

11:56.050 --> 11:58.746
Really, well, which way
does she want me to go?

11:59.420 --> 12:02.480
- Uh, that way.
- What?

12:02.656 --> 12:04.351
You lost the job, Morgan.

12:04.525 --> 12:06.152
Annie doesn't wanna use
your design.

12:06.961 --> 12:08.326
Why not?

12:08.496 --> 12:10.896
I mean, that is a great look.

12:11.065 --> 12:13.898
- You liked it, right?
- Me?

12:14.068 --> 12:17.060
Well, I thought it was great.

12:17.238 --> 12:19.672
I mean, I told Annie
she's making a big mistake.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.966
I should go talk to her.

12:21.142 --> 12:22.632
No, no, no. You know, it's pointless.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.210
Once Annie makes her decision,
there's no swaying her.

12:25.379 --> 12:27.711
I mean, she still holds on
to her Enron stock.

12:28.115 --> 12:29.139
What about Daniel?

12:29.316 --> 12:31.307
I mean, doesn't he have a say
in any of this?

12:31.485 --> 12:33.316
Freaking crazy chick.

12:33.487 --> 12:35.421
Got me decked out like a showgirl.

12:35.589 --> 12:37.056
Oh, Daniel, where are you going?

12:37.224 --> 12:38.248
To find a pub.

12:38.426 --> 12:40.018
I need a pint
to wash down these feathers.

12:40.194 --> 12:41.684
Daniel, please wait. Oh, Morgan...

12:41.862 --> 12:44.194
Who do you think you are
to judge my fashion?

12:44.365 --> 12:47.596
Okay, wait, wait, first of all, let's not
confuse fashion with poultry, okay?

12:47.768 --> 12:49.531
And second, it isn't just me.

12:49.703 --> 12:52.194
Even Sabrina said your outfit stunk.

12:52.373 --> 12:53.931
You said that?

12:54.108 --> 12:55.837
You told me you liked it.

12:56.010 --> 12:57.739
Well, I...

12:58.279 --> 13:00.372
- Oh!
- Morgan.

13:00.548 --> 13:02.140
I can't believe you told that
to her face.

13:02.316 --> 13:04.648
At least I had the decency
to trash her behind her back.

13:08.756 --> 13:10.883
Daniel, I know this is
the tenth message I've left you,

13:11.058 --> 13:13.219
but your voice mail only gives me
15 seconds to talk.

13:13.394 --> 13:17.421
I want to do the interview with you
and I think you looked cute in the fea...

13:19.100 --> 13:21.091
Ers, feathers.
Okay, all right, call me back.

13:21.268 --> 13:24.237
My number is on second
and third message.

13:24.939 --> 13:27.066
What happened to you?
You get stuck in a bicycle chain?

13:27.241 --> 13:28.469
Nothing happened.

13:28.642 --> 13:31.304
I'm just being the young,
hip cat that I am.

13:31.479 --> 13:33.538
Oh, speaking of which,
how is your hip?

13:33.714 --> 13:36.205
Uh, I have my good days
and my bad days.

13:39.920 --> 13:41.683
Morgan, wait. I can explain.

13:41.856 --> 13:42.948
Oh, really?

13:43.124 --> 13:45.456
I wouldn't know
which of your two faces to listen to.

13:45.626 --> 13:47.184
What do you mean?

13:47.361 --> 13:49.659
You told me that you liked my design
for Daniel Bedingfield

13:49.830 --> 13:51.388
and you told Annie that you don't.

13:51.565 --> 13:55.194
You told Roxie you liked her song,
and you told me that you didn't.

13:55.369 --> 13:56.563
That makes you two-faced.

13:56.737 --> 13:58.762
So you better face it.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.406
Twice.

14:00.574 --> 14:02.565
I am not two-faced.

14:02.743 --> 14:04.540
Yeah, right.

14:08.449 --> 14:10.007
Salem, are you talking to someone?

14:10.885 --> 14:13.183
What are you asking
the geezer for? He can't hear anything.

14:13.354 --> 14:14.912
What the?

14:15.990 --> 14:18.117
- Howdy.
- What's going on?

14:18.292 --> 14:20.783
You're a witch.
You should know about this.

14:20.961 --> 14:23.896
If a witch denies the truth,
she's forced to confront it.

14:24.064 --> 14:28.091
What? But, I was just trying
to spare Morgan and Roxie's feelings.

14:28.269 --> 14:29.668
That doesn't make me two-faced.

14:30.271 --> 14:33.104
No, I make you two-faced.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.034
Hey,
don't make me come back there.

14:38.612 --> 14:41.638
Morgan, open the door.
I really wanna talk to you.

14:41.815 --> 14:43.874
Well, I don't wanna talk to you.

14:44.051 --> 14:46.542
I like your design for Daniel.
I really do.

14:46.720 --> 14:47.744
Please.

14:47.922 --> 14:51.187
That outfit looked like something
San Diego Chicken wore to the prom.

14:53.327 --> 14:56.057
Hello? Oh, hi, Daniel.

14:56.230 --> 14:57.356
Oh, don't worry about Morgan.

14:57.531 --> 14:59.431
She's a professional,
she completely understands.

14:59.600 --> 15:03.559
Yeah, she's sobbing because
the bathroom light is so unflattering.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.134
Uh, thanks for calling.

15:07.508 --> 15:09.840
Um, really. That's great.

15:10.010 --> 15:12.672
Okay, yeah,
I'll meet you back at the office.

15:12.846 --> 15:14.837
I know, I know, five minutes
is all it's gonna take.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.880
Oh, thank you, you are the best.

15:18.352 --> 15:19.376
You're the best,

15:19.553 --> 15:22.420
oh, if I ever sound that phony,
just run backwards into the wall.

15:25.693 --> 15:27.923
- Who's that?
Her name's Friskie.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.222
And believe me, she is.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.763
Oh, Salem. Come on, a trophy kitty?

15:33.167 --> 15:34.327
That's right.

15:34.501 --> 15:38.904
And by the way, don't come a-knocking
if the trash can's a-rocking.

15:39.073 --> 15:40.734
Gotta go. Be sure to catch my show.

15:40.908 --> 15:42.603
Oh, what's with the guitar?

15:43.244 --> 15:45.474
Well, you came up
with that great idea for live music,

15:45.646 --> 15:46.670
so I taught myself guitar.

15:46.847 --> 15:48.542
I'm gonna sing my own songs.

15:48.716 --> 15:49.978
Oh, dear God.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.050
Uh, oh, you're gonna sing
on the radio?

15:52.586 --> 15:54.577
Thanks to you.
You probably saved my show.

15:54.755 --> 15:55.983
You're a true friend.

15:56.724 --> 15:58.191
Uh, Roxie, wait.

15:58.359 --> 15:59.656
Ow.

15:59.827 --> 16:02.762
Hey, no biting.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.125
Daniel, thanks so much
for coming back for this interview.

16:07.301 --> 16:10.031
I've got about five minutes.
I'm going to a gig.

16:10.204 --> 16:12.365
- Oh, you're performing tonight?
- Not me.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.598
This friend of mine.
He's got a one-man show.

16:14.775 --> 16:17.539
And I've seen him act.
It's gonna be a one-man audience too.

16:17.711 --> 16:19.269
So, what are you gonna say to him?

16:19.446 --> 16:22.108
Hmm, the same thing I say
every single time I see him act.

16:22.283 --> 16:23.682
"Nigel, you're dreadful. "

16:23.851 --> 16:26.149
- You say that to him?
- Yeah, he's my best friend.

16:26.320 --> 16:28.720
What good would I be
if I didn't tell him the truth?

16:28.889 --> 16:31.153
- Not good at all.
- Hmm, so interview?

16:31.558 --> 16:33.458
Actually, instead of the interview,

16:33.627 --> 16:35.288
would you sing
on my friend's radio show?

16:35.729 --> 16:37.060
- I can't...
- You don't understand.

16:37.231 --> 16:39.222
If you don't, she's gonna sing
one of her originals.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.129
And the truth is, as a singer,

16:41.302 --> 16:43.270
she's a musical version
of your friend Nigel.

16:44.204 --> 16:47.071
- Horrible, huh?
- Well, I wouldn't say horrible...

16:47.241 --> 16:48.606
I would.

16:48.776 --> 16:51.745
- So will you do it?
- I just don't know if I have time.

16:51.912 --> 16:55.245
Sure you do.
The radio station is, uh, right upstairs.

16:55.416 --> 16:56.781
- Come on.
- Oh.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.212
Oh, uh, hey, Cole?

16:58.385 --> 17:01.286
- Can you still do that cover story?
- Really?

17:01.455 --> 17:03.286
I have more important things
to take care of.

17:03.457 --> 17:06.118
Yeah, sure. I'll give Ozzy a call.

17:08.494 --> 17:11.224
You know,
I can swear that was a bakery.

17:11.397 --> 17:14.094
Oh, and tomorrow it'll be a butcher
and then a candlestick maker.

17:14.268 --> 17:15.359
Hey, that's America.

17:24.078 --> 17:25.375
How long has the elevator
been there?

17:25.546 --> 17:27.275
Oh, save the chitchat
for the beauty salon.

17:27.448 --> 17:28.608
Now, move along.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.945
And then she stabbed me
in the back.

17:33.120 --> 17:35.611
- You would never lie, would you?
- No.

17:35.789 --> 17:39.156
Morgan, I'm really sorry about this
but I'm on the air in 30 seconds.

17:39.326 --> 17:41.260
<i>Roxie, babe,
you're on in one minute.</i>

17:42.162 --> 17:44.357
You lied to me too.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.398
Morgan, we're all friends.
You, me, Sabrina.

17:47.568 --> 17:51.470
Sabrina is not your friend, my friend.
Not like me.

17:51.638 --> 17:53.970
I told you right up front
that your song sucks.

17:54.408 --> 17:57.400
Okay, I know you don't get my song,
but Sabrina said she liked it.

17:57.578 --> 18:00.308
And she's in the music business.
I think I can trust her.

18:00.481 --> 18:03.075
- Roxie, don't sing, your song sucks.
- What?

18:03.250 --> 18:05.013
I'm sorry,
I don't wanna hurt your feelings,

18:05.185 --> 18:07.119
but isn't it worse if I lie to you?

18:07.287 --> 18:09.187
Not at this point. We're on the air.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.914
Hey, we got a show to do, all right?

18:11.091 --> 18:13.992
If you girls wanna fight,
you can do it in my van later.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.493
I appreciate your honesty,
but you've ruined my show.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.426
I promised my listeners live music.

18:18.599 --> 18:20.658
They'll get it.
I brought Daniel Bedingfield with me.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.062
Daniel.

18:23.570 --> 18:26.198
Oh, my God.
You brought Daniel Bedingfield.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.500
And he doesn't have a lot of time.
So move.

18:28.675 --> 18:33.271
And now, live from Roxie's show,
here's Daniel Bedingfield.

19:01.750 --> 19:02.978
This is a really nice gesture,

19:03.151 --> 19:06.279
but we still have something to discuss,
like, my song sucks?

19:06.454 --> 19:09.423
Roxie, I only said I liked your song
because I was trying to be your friend.

19:09.591 --> 19:12.617
But a true friend wouldn't do that.
I want you to be my Nigel.

19:13.028 --> 19:14.655
Okay, who's Nigel?

19:14.829 --> 19:17.525
It's a long British story, the point is,
if we're gonna be friends,

19:17.699 --> 19:20.190
then we always have to be honest
with each other, right?

19:21.536 --> 19:22.594
Right?

19:23.104 --> 19:24.366
I guess you're right.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.063
And, Morgan,
I owe you an apology too.

19:26.241 --> 19:27.265
Yes, you do.

19:27.642 --> 19:30.167
There was nothing wrong
with Daniel's outfit.

19:30.345 --> 19:33.644
It just takes a certain kind of person
to pull off feathers.

19:33.815 --> 19:36.181
Yeah, a chicken plucker.
Look, Morgan, I'm sorry.

19:36.351 --> 19:37.750
I think you're a great designer,

19:37.919 --> 19:39.443
but I should have been
upfront with you.

19:39.621 --> 19:41.452
Daniel's outfit was awful.

19:41.890 --> 19:44.916
Whew, you know,
it feels good to be honest.

19:45.093 --> 19:46.788
Well, as long as we're being honest,

19:46.962 --> 19:48.691
you know
that carrot cake you made last week,

19:48.863 --> 19:50.763
that Roxie and I were raving about?

19:50.932 --> 19:52.331
Stinko.

19:52.701 --> 19:53.861
Great, good.

19:54.035 --> 19:55.627
And your pecan sandies?

19:55.804 --> 19:58.102
They taste like you actually
make them with sand.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.870
- Okay. Glad you told me.
- I see what you're saying.

20:01.042 --> 20:04.375
In the long run, being honest
is gonna make our friendship stronger.

20:04.546 --> 20:08.539
And, Sabrina, sometimes you go
a little heavy on the eyeliner.

20:09.451 --> 20:11.180
Oh, and that blue shirt
with the silver...

20:11.353 --> 20:12.752
Okay, enough.

20:12.921 --> 20:15.412
Friends don't let friends
get too friendly.

20:33.063 --> 20:35.088
Hey. Where's Friskie?

20:35.265 --> 20:37.358
Uh, she was just using me.

20:37.534 --> 20:38.899
Typical gold digger.

20:39.069 --> 20:40.502
She wanted a Tiffany collar.

20:40.670 --> 20:42.570
She would only eat
out of the best bowls.

20:42.739 --> 20:44.969
You know, with that age difference,
it's a matter of time

20:45.142 --> 20:46.973
before you're sleeping
on separate windowsills,

20:47.144 --> 20:48.475
each in your own ray of sunlight.

20:48.645 --> 20:52.945
Hey, I don't need a little sex kitten
around to make me feel young.

20:53.116 --> 20:55.243
Good for you.
You wanna watch some TV?

20:55.719 --> 20:58.552
What, are you crazy? It's 8:30.

20:58.722 --> 21:00.212
I'm going to bed.

21:03.126 --> 21:04.753
Night, pops.
