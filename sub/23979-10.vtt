00:01.160 --> 00:02.958
Stella: Previously
on "Life Sentence"...

00:03.000 --> 00:04.957
You know I'm not here
'cause I wanna be, right?

00:05.000 --> 00:07.082
I didn't come here because
I wanted to be, either,

00:07.130 --> 00:09.121
but then helping people,
it was helping me, too.

00:09.170 --> 00:11.161
Gina, Diego's new boss.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.177
-I am.

00:13.220 --> 00:15.040
I'm a history
professor.

00:15.090 --> 00:17.252
Why don't you put your number in
here, and I'll give you a call.

00:17.300 --> 00:18.882
I don't date guys
who try to game me.

00:18.930 --> 00:20.056
I'm not gaming you.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.226
-No.

00:21.270 --> 00:22.556
Can we be friends?

00:22.600 --> 00:24.227
I really like hanging
out with you.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.475
What was that for?

00:27.520 --> 00:29.227
Don't ask questions.
Women are confusing.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.066
You told me that you and Wes
were having problems.

00:31.110 --> 00:33.351
No, I-I said that things
were complicated

00:33.400 --> 00:35.198
because of Dr. Grant
and Pippa.

00:35.240 --> 00:36.480
When other people
come into the mix,

00:36.530 --> 00:38.157
it is a symptom
of a bigger issue.

00:38.200 --> 00:40.749
Every conversation that we have
is about your wants

00:40.790 --> 00:42.781
and your needs
and your feelings.

00:42.830 --> 00:44.958
So when are we gonna talk
about what I want?

00:45.000 --> 00:46.536
I'm gonna stay
at Diego's tonight.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.491
I'm just not sure if
we're gonna last forever.

00:48.540 --> 00:50.497
-So much.

00:50.550 --> 00:51.585
Then you don't give up.

00:51.630 --> 00:53.416
You work on it.

01:01.100 --> 01:04.980
Watching as the world
all passes by

01:07.150 --> 01:09.107
Stella: Every marriage goes
through tough times...

01:09.150 --> 01:13.735
Pulling fast like sand
against the tide

01:13.780 --> 01:16.021
...but no matter
how tough things get,

01:16.070 --> 01:17.777
you have to come to the table.

01:17.820 --> 01:22.781
With all your will,
you reach out to hold on

01:22.830 --> 01:23.820
Hi.

01:23.870 --> 01:26.783
Hi.

01:26.830 --> 01:29.629
So, did you call to see
if you could still

01:29.670 --> 01:31.456
take that job
in San Francisco?

01:31.500 --> 01:32.831
- I did.
-Great!

01:32.880 --> 01:35.008
And I hope the guy
that they already hired

01:35.050 --> 01:37.087
will be very happy
in it.

01:37.130 --> 01:38.586
Oh, Wes...

01:38.640 --> 01:40.677
I...

01:40.720 --> 01:42.677
really messed up
your future, haven't I?

01:42.720 --> 01:45.633
That's just it.
It isn't my future.

01:45.680 --> 01:48.843
It's our future.

01:48.900 --> 01:49.970
You're right.

01:50.020 --> 01:52.102
It is.

01:52.150 --> 01:54.437
And we are going to start
making decisions

01:54.490 --> 01:55.560
about it together.

01:57.910 --> 02:01.574
So will you just come home,
and we'll talk about it?

02:01.620 --> 02:03.577
Of course.

02:05.160 --> 02:07.959
I'll see you tonight.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.287
Yeah.

02:10.330 --> 02:13.493
Don't look back

02:13.550 --> 02:16.622
Breathe in slowly

02:16.670 --> 02:18.468
Feel your heartbeat

02:18.510 --> 02:21.252
I knew I had my work
cut out for me with Wes...

02:21.300 --> 02:22.677
Every moment

02:22.720 --> 02:25.428
...which made me
miss the early days

02:25.470 --> 02:26.847
when things were
easy and playful...

02:28.560 --> 02:30.221
...when we were super hot
for each other...

02:32.060 --> 02:35.030
Oh!
I'll come back later.

02:35.070 --> 02:36.890
...and we couldn't bear
to be apart.

02:36.940 --> 02:39.409
Oh, my God!
Diego, stop!

02:39.450 --> 02:40.861
You can't say stuff
like that to me

02:40.910 --> 02:43.402
when I'm not gonna
see you for two days.

02:43.450 --> 02:46.033
The worst was that
everyone else was so happy.

02:46.080 --> 02:48.788
Oh, hey, honey.
Are you here to see me?

02:48.830 --> 02:52.949
'Cause I got nothing going on
and I am miserable.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.627
Why are you smiling?

02:54.670 --> 02:57.128
Sorry, it's just so nice
to not be the only miserable

02:57.170 --> 02:58.831
Abbott in town today.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.507
Does this have anything to do
with the 6-foot British guy

03:00.550 --> 03:02.848
I saw sleeping on
the couch last night?

03:02.890 --> 03:04.380
Yeah.

03:04.430 --> 03:07.218
But he's home now,
and we're gonna work on us.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.011
Which is why
I'm gonna read

03:09.060 --> 03:10.971
all of Lizzie's
marriage books

03:11.020 --> 03:12.761
and figure out exactly
how to do that.

03:12.810 --> 03:15.188
Oh, can I make
a suggestion?

03:15.230 --> 03:16.527
Please.

03:16.570 --> 03:19.062
While you guys
are working on stuff,

03:19.110 --> 03:21.602
don't ignore what's good
between you two.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.617
You've got
great chemistry,

03:23.660 --> 03:26.231
and sex can get you
through the tough times.

03:26.290 --> 03:27.826
I'm telling you,
your father and I --

03:27.870 --> 03:29.156
And I'm out!

03:29.200 --> 03:31.919
Okay, honey.
Well, I love you!

03:31.960 --> 03:34.622
Have good sex!
-I'm not listening!

03:34.670 --> 03:36.798
Don't worry about a thing

03:36.840 --> 03:40.799
You'll learn to live again

03:40.840 --> 03:42.968
You're gonna learn
to live again

03:43.010 --> 03:47.675
Oh, oh, oh

03:47.720 --> 03:49.267
This place is closed
for good,

03:49.310 --> 03:52.940
so it does not look like
they are hiring waiters.

03:52.980 --> 03:54.937
You're gonna find
a job soon.

03:56.980 --> 03:58.391
It looks like they were
in the middle of a remodel

03:58.440 --> 03:59.817
and just walked out.

03:59.860 --> 04:01.442
Someone should convert
this into a bar.

04:01.490 --> 04:03.447
That's what Main Street
really needs.

04:03.490 --> 04:04.980
It does have great bones.

04:05.030 --> 04:06.520
Hey, why don't I do that?

04:08.450 --> 04:10.111
I would be
a great bar owner.

04:10.160 --> 04:11.742
It's like throwing
a party every night.

04:11.790 --> 04:13.747
Plus, you've seen
my carpentry skills.

04:13.790 --> 04:15.667
I'm pretty great with
a pneumatic nail gun.

04:15.710 --> 04:16.950
No, you are not.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.707
Still...

04:18.750 --> 04:20.752
I've always wanted
to own my own bar.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.871
When I was 9,
I ran a side hustle

04:22.930 --> 04:24.887
out of Lizzie's
Lemonade Stand.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.671
Spiked all the moms'
drinks with vodka.

04:26.720 --> 04:28.757
How did you get vodka
when you were 9?

04:28.810 --> 04:30.847
Found it in the bushes.

04:30.890 --> 04:32.767
You haven't met my mom.
She's fun.

04:32.810 --> 04:33.936
Well...

04:33.980 --> 04:36.358
I think it's a great idea.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.562
Me too.

04:38.610 --> 04:39.930
Hey, look at me.

04:39.980 --> 04:41.311
I'm a man with a plan.

04:41.360 --> 04:43.692
Yeah, you are!

04:43.740 --> 04:46.562
Nope.
Mnh-mnh.

04:46.620 --> 04:48.156
I thought
we had a moment.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.611
I thought
we were friends.

04:49.660 --> 04:51.401
But you kissed me
the other day, and...

04:54.080 --> 04:55.991
...we are not talking
about that.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.088
Good to know.

05:07.090 --> 05:09.422
-Hi.

05:09.470 --> 05:11.928
Step one -- research.

05:11.970 --> 05:14.849
So, it turns out we are not
the first people in the world

05:14.890 --> 05:17.018
<i>to have
marital problems.</i>

05:17.060 --> 05:19.688
So, high five.

05:23.070 --> 05:26.813
The We Factor,
Crisis Immersion,

05:26.860 --> 05:29.363
Emotional Stress
Fracture Theory.

05:29.410 --> 05:31.037
Kinda sounds like
the line-up of Coachella.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.243
By the way, I also invited
Lizzie over tomorrow

05:34.290 --> 05:37.703
to talk about
couples counseling.

05:37.750 --> 05:40.208
It really helped her
and Diego.

05:40.250 --> 05:42.412
Counseling.
Okay.

05:42.460 --> 05:44.918
I just thought we might
need someone to help us

05:44.970 --> 05:46.426
sort through
our specific problems,

05:46.470 --> 05:48.962
like you hating your job
and my super-invasive family

05:49.010 --> 05:50.387
and Dr. Grant
and Pippa and --

05:50.430 --> 05:51.886
We do have
a lot to sort through.

05:53.180 --> 05:56.389
Hey,
but in the meantime...

05:56.440 --> 05:59.728
why don't we focus on
what's good between us?

06:05.150 --> 06:08.233
I could get into this...

06:08.280 --> 06:13.696
Say that you're the one
who's taking me home

06:13.740 --> 06:15.947
"Cause I want you
on my skin and my bones

06:16.000 --> 06:17.490
My mom was right.

06:17.540 --> 06:19.076
No matter what, Wes and I

06:19.120 --> 06:21.498
always had one thing
to fall back on.

06:21.540 --> 06:26.876
We had great chemistry,
but that night we did not.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.252
And we've never had
that problem before.

06:29.300 --> 06:30.290
We just
were not connecting.

06:30.340 --> 06:31.922
Okay.

06:31.970 --> 06:34.883
I know how sisters talk,
but I'm a modest Brit,

06:34.930 --> 06:37.228
and if you could pretend
to talk about anything

06:37.270 --> 06:38.476
other than our disaster sex,

06:38.520 --> 06:40.056
I would appreciate it.

06:40.100 --> 06:42.102
-So bad.

06:42.150 --> 06:44.642
-Hey, it's totally normal.

06:44.690 --> 06:46.852
Bad sex happens when
you're in crisis mode.

06:46.900 --> 06:48.106
Don't freak out.

06:48.150 --> 06:49.390
You guys will discuss it
in therapy.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.111
Ooh-hoo, cannot wait.

06:51.160 --> 06:54.152
We're ready to set up a session
like yesterday, so...

06:54.200 --> 06:56.111
number, please?
-Yeah, about that...

06:56.160 --> 06:57.992
My therapist rates
have...

06:58.040 --> 07:01.874
gone up since Diego
and I saw her last.

07:01.920 --> 07:03.331
She's
$300 an hour now.

07:03.380 --> 07:04.745
Good God.
Is she a wizard?

07:04.800 --> 07:06.666
There are a million
other therapists.

07:06.710 --> 07:08.917
Okay, so we just need to find
one that works with our budget.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.210
Which is?

07:10.260 --> 07:12.422
Somewhere in the
neighborhood of free?

07:12.470 --> 07:13.710
You know what?

07:13.760 --> 07:15.091
I can check at
the hospital later.

07:15.140 --> 07:16.926
Maybe I can get
a volunteer discount.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.519
-It is not.

07:22.100 --> 07:23.602
I needed to talk
to the one person

07:23.650 --> 07:25.470
who always made me
feel better...

07:25.520 --> 07:28.239
Hey, there's my girl!
How you doing?

07:28.280 --> 07:30.146
...but he seemed so happy

07:30.200 --> 07:32.942
that I didn't want to make him
feel worse, so...

07:32.990 --> 07:35.231
I'm great!
You ready to do this?

07:35.280 --> 07:37.578
I cannot believe that you
signed up for a 5K.

07:37.620 --> 07:39.998
Gina signed us up, and she
wants to train together,

07:40.040 --> 07:41.781
but I don't want to look
stupid and out of breath,

07:41.830 --> 07:43.707
so I'm going to
pre-train with you,

07:43.750 --> 07:45.627
and then when
I'm less embarrassing,

07:45.670 --> 07:47.331
I will train with her.

07:47.380 --> 07:49.121
You really like her,
don't you?

07:49.170 --> 07:50.752
I really do.

07:50.800 --> 07:53.087
I could see us having
something really special...

07:53.140 --> 07:54.960
like what you
and Wes have.

07:55.010 --> 07:56.500
Yeah, I want that
for you, too, Dad.

07:56.560 --> 07:57.959
Come on.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.215
But I think our family

07:59.270 --> 08:01.011
may be a little complicated
for her.

08:01.060 --> 08:02.266
It is...

08:02.310 --> 08:04.096
but you can keep her away
from all that.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.970
Just try
and focus on her.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.647
Will do.

08:07.690 --> 08:09.431
Hey, let's go left up here
so we can get a milkshake.

08:09.480 --> 08:11.391
-Dad, we're in training.
-Oh, come on!

08:11.450 --> 08:13.691
Father-daughter dates
always include milkshakes.

08:13.740 --> 08:15.196
Nope, not today.

08:15.240 --> 08:17.572
You have got a girlfriend
to impress.

08:17.620 --> 08:19.907
I do, don't I?

08:19.950 --> 08:21.907
I may have screwed up
my relationship,

08:21.960 --> 08:24.201
but I was gonna be nothing
but helpful to Dad's.

08:24.250 --> 08:28.835
I took you out of the fund
because you were a class B.

08:28.880 --> 08:31.793
It wasn't really enough
of a return.

08:31.840 --> 08:33.422
I like the core
strategy for you,

08:33.470 --> 08:35.586
so I say we keep moving
the portfolio

08:35.640 --> 08:36.674
in that direction.

08:36.720 --> 08:39.178
Great, thanks.

08:39.220 --> 08:43.554
Now that Stella's
not sick,

08:43.600 --> 08:45.728
mind if I have my key back?
-Sure.

08:47.770 --> 08:50.228
Full disclosure --
I have copies.

08:50.280 --> 08:54.148
Alright, well,
one key at a time.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.816
So you're just here
to mainline jam, or...

08:55.860 --> 08:57.521
Oh, no, I'm here to talk
to you about the bar.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.731
You're going
to law school?

08:58.780 --> 09:00.157
No, I'm talking
about a real bar.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.656
The important kind where
people get drunk.

09:01.700 --> 09:03.532
Oh, of course.
How silly of me.

09:03.580 --> 09:05.070
See, I wanna buy one.

09:05.120 --> 09:08.875
That way, I can hire myself,
which means I can come

09:08.920 --> 09:10.706
and go to the bar
after my curfew

09:10.750 --> 09:13.378
because it's also
my workplace.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.922
Boom! Bonus.

09:14.970 --> 09:17.086
You want to buy a bar?

09:17.140 --> 09:18.175
It's brilliant, right?

09:18.220 --> 09:20.928
Uh...

09:20.970 --> 09:22.301
Where's the money
coming from?

09:22.350 --> 09:23.920
I'm gonna get
a small business loan.

09:23.980 --> 09:25.630
-I don't have one of those.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.146
-Got nothing.

09:27.190 --> 09:29.181
And you're a convicted
felon, right?

09:29.230 --> 09:31.278
No offense, but why
do you think a bank

09:31.320 --> 09:33.607
is gonna hand you
money to open a bar?

09:33.650 --> 09:36.950
Because I have a friend
who knows all the ins and outs

09:36.990 --> 09:38.810
on the financial stuff,
and he's gonna coach me.

09:38.870 --> 09:40.736
I mean, your friend's only gonna
be able to get you far...

09:40.780 --> 09:44.444
Oh, this is gonna turn out
to be me, isn't it?

09:44.500 --> 09:46.070
-Hi.

09:46.120 --> 09:48.282
-So glad I caught you.
-Just running to class.

09:48.330 --> 09:49.832
Uh, I don't know
if I'd call it "running".

09:49.880 --> 09:51.541
I'm a little sore
from training.

09:51.590 --> 09:53.627
Gina has me doing a 5K.

09:53.670 --> 09:55.661
Oow!
I like this Gina.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.040
Me, too.

09:57.090 --> 09:59.138
So, what's going on?

09:59.180 --> 10:01.046
Well, I've been writing
a children's book,

10:01.100 --> 10:03.592
and I sent it to
a small publisher, and...

10:03.640 --> 10:05.381
they don't hate it!
-That's great news!

10:05.430 --> 10:06.807
I know.

10:06.850 --> 10:08.477
And now they want to see
some mockups of the art,

10:08.520 --> 10:11.148
so I was thinking you might
know an art student

10:11.190 --> 10:13.602
who might be
interested in helping.

10:13.650 --> 10:16.108
I think
I do know one person.

10:22.530 --> 10:25.079
I'm gonna kill you.

10:27.080 --> 10:30.323
Really? That is amazing!
Thank you!

10:32.170 --> 10:34.298
Guess who just got
free marriage therapy.

10:34.340 --> 10:36.581
Oh, that's great.
How did you do it?

10:36.630 --> 10:38.212
You know
that social-worker guy

10:38.260 --> 10:39.796
Miles-something who comes
around here to do counseling?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.296
Well, he needed
a bunch more hours

10:41.350 --> 10:42.545
to complete his Master's,

10:42.600 --> 10:44.170
and I convinced him
to take us on.

10:44.220 --> 10:45.426
And the sooner the better,

10:45.470 --> 10:46.972
because lately
it feels like Wes

10:47.020 --> 10:49.182
and I have the only
wonky relationship in town.

10:49.230 --> 10:51.301
I swear, if I see
another happy couple,

10:51.360 --> 10:53.260
I'm literally gonna vomit.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.357
Uh...
then don't look.

11:07.370 --> 11:08.781
Stella: The weird thing

11:08.830 --> 11:09.911
about watching Dr. Grant
and Dr. Russo

11:09.960 --> 11:11.871
micro-grope each other

11:11.920 --> 11:15.333
was that seeing this happy
couple actually made me happy.

11:15.380 --> 11:17.121
One of the problems
in my marriage had been solved

11:17.170 --> 11:20.629
without any work at all.

11:20.680 --> 11:23.889
Hi.

11:23.930 --> 11:25.637
I'm sorry.
I was just --

11:25.680 --> 11:29.014
Trying to swallow
Dr. Russo's face?

11:29.060 --> 11:32.189
So, you and Dr. Russo.

11:32.230 --> 11:33.470
Um...yeah.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.067
Dr. Russo's amazing.

11:35.110 --> 11:37.397
I am really happy
for you.

11:37.440 --> 11:38.566
And I meant it...

11:38.610 --> 11:40.351
Cool.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.402
...even though things
were still really awkward.

11:42.450 --> 11:44.566
So, what can we do
for you?

11:44.620 --> 11:47.408
The first round of the new
trial went very well,

11:47.450 --> 11:50.499
but I do need someone to take
the file to Hematology.

11:50.540 --> 11:53.749
File Transport just happens
to be my specialty.

11:53.790 --> 11:56.339
Okay.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.466
Seriously?
Mom?

12:00.510 --> 12:02.831
Your mom's a great
artist, Lizzie.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.212
She stopped pursuing it
to raise you guys.

12:05.260 --> 12:07.467
I always thought she
should get back to it.

12:07.510 --> 12:09.808
And she needs
her own thing.

12:09.850 --> 12:13.093
I get that, but I don't get
why it has to be on me.

12:13.150 --> 12:14.345
When your mom
and I split up,

12:14.400 --> 12:16.641
Aiden helped me
get back on my feet.

12:16.690 --> 12:18.522
It brought us closer.

12:18.570 --> 12:20.607
I just think
that your mom

12:20.650 --> 12:23.358
could use your help
in that same way.

12:27.910 --> 12:29.116
So...

12:29.160 --> 12:30.867
what is up?

12:33.500 --> 12:36.162
I was hoping you would
read my book.

12:36.210 --> 12:38.622
And if you like it,
maybe you would be interested

12:38.670 --> 12:40.877
in doing some mock-ups
of the artwork.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.547
-Yeah.

12:42.590 --> 12:44.627
Wow!
Of course, Lizzie!

12:44.680 --> 12:46.921
I can't wait to read it.

12:46.970 --> 12:49.803
And thank you for thinking
of me for this.

12:49.850 --> 12:51.636
Oh, honey,
I am so touched.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.011
Oh, Mom.

12:55.690 --> 12:58.011
Wes: The loan officer
that I set you up with

12:58.060 --> 12:59.471
is open to risk,

12:59.520 --> 13:01.488
but she needs to believe
that you're a good bet.

13:01.530 --> 13:04.318
So you need to be prepared
for questions like --

13:04.360 --> 13:06.738
What experience do you
have running a bar?

13:06.780 --> 13:10.489
None, but I do have experience
running out of a bar.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.610
Why?

13:11.660 --> 13:12.900
-Bartender's husband.
-Got it.

13:12.950 --> 13:16.113
Hi. Okay, I have
some really good news.

13:16.170 --> 13:19.162
Oh!
What...is...all this?

13:19.210 --> 13:20.416
Aiden's future!

13:20.460 --> 13:22.918
He's buying a bar.

13:25.380 --> 13:27.678
Oh.
My God, you're serious.

13:27.720 --> 13:29.427
That's so great!

13:29.470 --> 13:31.632
Yeah, I'm helping Aiden
prepare for his bank interview.

13:31.680 --> 13:33.842
By the way, we still got to
go over your five-year plan.

13:33.890 --> 13:35.130
Pretty sure
the five-year plan

13:35.190 --> 13:36.726
is to sell as much
alcohol as possible.

13:36.770 --> 13:38.090
Nailed it.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.061
I'm so sorry, Stells.
What is your good news?

13:40.110 --> 13:41.851
Well,
I managed to get us

13:41.900 --> 13:43.686
free marriage
therapy at the hospital...

13:43.740 --> 13:45.640
-Oh, that's great!
-...in 20 minutes.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.849
Okay.

13:46.910 --> 13:50.198
Aiden,
you think you got this?

13:50.240 --> 13:52.789
I'm gold.

13:55.580 --> 13:57.537
Right, don't show off
the bling.

13:57.580 --> 14:00.083
Got it.

14:02.960 --> 14:04.917
So you're our
couples counselor?

14:04.970 --> 14:08.338
Yes. I'm...yes.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.540
Right.
Are you old enough to --

14:10.600 --> 14:13.217
I'm 24, Master's student,
still training,

14:13.270 --> 14:16.342
but I assure you,
I am qualified.

14:16.390 --> 14:19.599
And he's free, so let's
jump in, shall we?

14:19.650 --> 14:21.300
Headline -- The two of us
are having trouble

14:21.360 --> 14:22.759
operating as a "we"

14:22.820 --> 14:25.232
because we didn't plan
on having a future.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.486
I thought you said
you were married.

14:26.530 --> 14:28.988
We are, but I was
planning on dying.

14:29.030 --> 14:31.067
O...kay.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.077
Let's unpack that.

14:33.120 --> 14:36.078
Wes and I filled Miles in
on all the details.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.781
We got married
on a whim.

14:37.830 --> 14:40.413
I left my family and my job
in London to move here.

14:40.460 --> 14:42.588
The INS thought that
we were faking our marriage.

14:42.630 --> 14:44.086
I lied about everything.

14:44.130 --> 14:46.087
There's this doctor
that I work with.

14:46.130 --> 14:47.757
And my ex-fiance
turned up.

14:47.800 --> 14:49.211
I thought
I wanted a baby.

14:49.260 --> 14:51.592
I'm exhausted from this job
that I hate.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.507
And then
we had trash-fire sex.

14:54.560 --> 14:57.268
I'm sorry,
is that good or bad?

14:57.310 --> 14:59.301
Not good, Miles.
Not good.

14:59.350 --> 15:01.728
Okay, well, this...

15:01.770 --> 15:05.024
is not something I've seen
in my training...

15:06.650 --> 15:12.191
...but it seems to me like
the core issue is that...

15:12.240 --> 15:14.527
From the moment Wes maxed
out his credit card

15:14.580 --> 15:18.460
to buy you an engagement
ring a week after you met,

15:18.500 --> 15:21.959
he's been trying to make you
happy at his own expense.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.628
Right, but, to be fair,
I didn't know

15:24.670 --> 15:26.456
that he had maxed out
his credit card

15:26.500 --> 15:29.299
to buy this ring
until like 30 seconds ago.

15:29.340 --> 15:32.332
"Cause I would never,
ever ask him to do that.

15:32.390 --> 15:36.509
But I did it anyway.

15:36.560 --> 15:38.676
I mean, I would've been happy
with rubber bands

15:38.730 --> 15:40.630
on our fingers, but...

15:40.690 --> 15:43.057
when we went past
that shop in Paris...

15:49.650 --> 15:50.731
...I saw your eyes
light up,

15:50.780 --> 15:54.023
and I...

15:54.070 --> 15:58.405
I just couldn't
help myself.

15:58.450 --> 16:00.157
Exactly.

16:00.210 --> 16:01.996
And you still can't.

16:02.040 --> 16:06.159
You're still functioning as
though Stella's time is limited.

16:06.210 --> 16:09.999
Your dynamic is built
around making her life

16:10.050 --> 16:12.838
as happy as possible.

16:12.880 --> 16:15.212
I don't want that.

16:15.260 --> 16:16.341
Good.

16:16.390 --> 16:19.052
Then, Wes, you have to change.

16:19.100 --> 16:21.341
You can't be the only one
making sacrifices.

16:21.390 --> 16:22.801
Well...

16:22.850 --> 16:26.013
Wes isn't the one
making all the sacrifices.

16:26.060 --> 16:27.562
I'm sorry, I...

16:27.610 --> 16:32.559
Okay, what sacrifices
have you made for Wes?

16:32.610 --> 16:35.693
Um...

16:35.740 --> 16:38.198
Oh!
I buy 1% milk.

16:38.240 --> 16:40.698
It's basically water.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.427
I think we need
a hew counselor.

16:57.470 --> 16:58.710
100%.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.138
Clearly Miles
is on your side.

17:01.180 --> 17:02.727
Wait, what?

17:02.770 --> 17:05.432
Clearly he said that all of
our problems are my fault

17:05.480 --> 17:06.766
because I'm selfish.

17:06.810 --> 17:08.972
Uh, he said all our problems
are my fault

17:09.020 --> 17:10.476
because I don't
stand up for myself.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.099
Well, it is not fair for you
to resent me for things

17:12.150 --> 17:14.448
I didn't ask you to do.
-I don't resent you!

17:14.490 --> 17:16.196
I just wish that
I wasn't the one

17:16.240 --> 17:17.480
making all the sacrifices.

17:17.530 --> 17:20.157
I will make sacrifices.

17:20.200 --> 17:23.249
But Miles is
on probation.

17:23.290 --> 17:26.248
So many copies!

17:26.290 --> 17:29.248
Why are you not
wearing pants?

17:29.290 --> 17:31.122
- Because
I'm in my own home.

17:31.170 --> 17:33.662
Well, we got a meeting with
the loan officer in 10 minutes.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.427
No, you don't need me.
You got this.

17:35.470 --> 17:37.507
I do need you.
You know this banker,

17:37.550 --> 17:39.427
and we practiced with you
on my left side.

17:39.470 --> 17:41.962
I need my left-hand man.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.387
Please?

17:44.430 --> 17:47.058
-It's okay.
Okay.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.852
Give me three minutes.
-Two minutes!

17:48.900 --> 17:50.766
We've got a banker
to dazzle.

17:53.940 --> 17:55.317
Paul:
You want to grab lunch?

17:55.360 --> 17:58.022
There's a TexMex place
across the street.

17:58.070 --> 18:00.983
Perfect, 'cause I could use
a stiff margarita.

18:01.030 --> 18:02.657
My girlfriend's
insisting that I come

18:02.700 --> 18:04.111
to her engagement party
tomorrow night.

18:04.160 --> 18:05.787
-It's fun.
-Nightmare.

18:05.830 --> 18:07.491
I'm the last of my
single friends, so they gather

18:07.540 --> 18:09.781
around me at these things
like I'm a unicorn --

18:09.830 --> 18:12.049
sad, spinster unicorn.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.956
Well...
what if I come with you?

18:14.010 --> 18:15.796
I would never ask you
to do that.

18:15.840 --> 18:17.422
Why not?

18:17.470 --> 18:18.631
Because the new boyfriend
always gets grilled,

18:18.680 --> 18:20.045
and it's really far.

18:20.090 --> 18:22.468
I'd drive to Nebraska
if you ask me to.

18:22.510 --> 18:26.265
I'm serious about the offer
and about you.

18:26.310 --> 18:27.846
You are my priority.

18:27.890 --> 18:28.971
That means a lot.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.351
You have a big family,

18:30.400 --> 18:31.470
and I've been down
that road before, so --

18:31.520 --> 18:33.522
Hey, my kids are grown.

18:33.570 --> 18:36.483
You have
my full attention.

18:36.530 --> 18:38.396
And you have mine.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.906
Hmm.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.327
-I feel like I got punched

18:43.370 --> 18:44.610
in the face
with a stuffed sock.

18:44.660 --> 18:46.492
I remember that feeling.
Good times.

18:46.540 --> 18:47.996
How are things going
with Mom?

18:48.040 --> 18:49.201
I'm waiting for her
to finish reading my book,

18:49.250 --> 18:51.207
but I don't expect much.

18:51.250 --> 18:53.548
You know how Mom criticizes
everything I do.

18:53.590 --> 18:56.207
That is not true.

18:56.260 --> 18:57.659
Is that true?

18:57.720 --> 19:00.883
Hi, Lizzie!
Hi.

19:02.510 --> 19:04.000
I finished your book.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.848
-I loved it!

19:06.890 --> 19:09.382
Hmm.
-Thanks, Mom.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.010
I'm glad you liked it.

19:11.060 --> 19:12.971
So did you feel inspired
to do any

19:13.020 --> 19:14.852
"Kitty Loses Her Meow"
sketches?

19:14.900 --> 19:16.811
-Let me show you.
-Okay.

19:16.860 --> 19:19.192
Okay.

19:19.240 --> 19:22.312
Okay.

19:22.370 --> 19:24.771
Is this a cat?

19:24.830 --> 19:25.900
It's a pineapple.

19:25.950 --> 19:28.999
A pineapple
is not a cat.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.327
No, honey.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.701
It's a fruit.

19:32.750 --> 19:34.582
But I didn't write a book
about a fruit.

19:34.630 --> 19:36.496
The way you wrote it
was so literal,

19:36.550 --> 19:38.541
but if the cat
couldn't meow

19:38.590 --> 19:41.469
because it's a pineapple,
that would be fun!

19:41.510 --> 19:45.299
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

19:45.350 --> 19:50.720
The publisher kinda thinks
it's fun as it is.

19:50.770 --> 19:53.762
Well, if that's what they want,
I will take the note,

19:53.810 --> 19:55.016
and I will show you

19:55.060 --> 19:58.064
some more sketches
at home later.

19:58.110 --> 19:59.987
Excellent! Whoo!
-Okay. Thanks, Mom.

20:00.030 --> 20:02.317
-Got it.
-Yeah.

20:02.360 --> 20:04.818
Okay.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.520
And we have a lease

20:06.580 --> 20:09.368
that over three years
will allow us to amortize...

20:09.410 --> 20:13.916
fixed costs to offset
operating expenses.

20:13.960 --> 20:15.416
Now, I know what
you're thinking --

20:15.460 --> 20:18.589
A bar is a risk,
but the numbers are solid.

20:18.630 --> 20:20.587
So what do you say?

20:20.630 --> 20:22.928
I love it.

20:22.970 --> 20:25.712
I like betting on new ideas.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.639
-No.

20:28.680 --> 20:29.761
Why not?

20:29.810 --> 20:31.426
He's got
no employment history,

20:31.480 --> 20:33.130
he's wearing
an ankle monitor --

20:33.190 --> 20:34.589
yes, I saw it --

20:34.650 --> 20:36.436
plus he's got the credit
score of a potted plant.

20:36.480 --> 20:38.391
Please,
I'm vouching for Aiden.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.182
He's a smart guy,
he's very hard-working,

20:41.240 --> 20:42.947
or he can be
when he wants to be.

20:42.990 --> 20:45.106
Aiden just needs someone
to take a chance on him.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.400
I just can't do it.

20:46.450 --> 20:47.940
Now, if it were
someone like you,

20:47.990 --> 20:49.947
Wes, you don't have a ton
of savings or collateral,

20:49.990 --> 20:51.617
but you've got
a finance background

20:51.660 --> 20:53.116
and employment history.

20:53.160 --> 20:56.664
Well, I have great news.

20:56.710 --> 20:58.792
We're partners.

21:07.390 --> 21:09.461
Hey, bro, it was not cool of you
to reject me outright

21:09.510 --> 21:10.636
in front of that banker.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.091
I'm sorry.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.881
I do feel like this
is a great idea for you.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.260
It's just...

21:15.310 --> 21:16.641
it's not for me.

21:16.690 --> 21:18.351
So what I'm hearing
you say is that

21:18.400 --> 21:19.856
you'd like
to see the space,

21:19.900 --> 21:21.527
so I'm gonna grab the keys
from the leasing office.

21:21.570 --> 21:23.481
-Aiden.
-Please, Wes.

21:23.530 --> 21:25.601
I've never asked you
for anything before.

21:25.660 --> 21:28.027
That's literally
all you've done.

21:28.070 --> 21:30.027
I'll see you there
in 10!

21:38.920 --> 21:40.376
Aiden?

21:42.710 --> 21:44.838
Sorry about the dust.

21:44.880 --> 21:47.588
So, this is the space.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.678
It is rough, but it has
got great bones, right?

21:50.720 --> 21:51.846
Yeah, it does.

21:51.890 --> 21:53.517
So, I'm thinking...

21:53.560 --> 21:57.019
a projector over there
playing old movies,

21:57.060 --> 21:59.438
a couple
of game tables here.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.266
Yeah, I can see that.

22:01.320 --> 22:04.358
And the projector works,
but I might put it over here

22:04.400 --> 22:06.528
<i>for a cooler
visual backdrop.</i>

22:06.570 --> 22:08.607
I like it.

22:08.660 --> 22:11.197
Hey, Stella!

22:11.240 --> 22:12.981
What's going on?
Is this an ambush?

22:13.040 --> 22:15.077
No, I just thought you might
want to talk to your wife

22:15.120 --> 22:17.168
before you make some
kind of big investment.

22:17.210 --> 22:19.872
Alright, check it out.
Huh, what do you think, sis?

22:19.920 --> 22:21.991
I think...

22:22.050 --> 22:23.620
this layout is amazing.
-Yeah!

22:23.670 --> 22:25.377
And the location's
pretty ideal.

22:25.420 --> 22:26.751
What --
What's gonna go over here?

22:26.800 --> 22:28.256
Oh.

22:28.300 --> 22:32.089
This area is reserved
for the classy beer pong.

22:32.140 --> 22:33.505
How is beer pong classy?

22:33.560 --> 22:36.882
Custom table,
no plastic cups.

22:36.930 --> 22:38.432
No.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.515
Wait.

22:39.560 --> 22:41.471
Maybe.

22:41.520 --> 22:43.318
-Ooh! He's feeling it!
-You are.

22:43.360 --> 22:45.146
You are feeling it.

22:45.190 --> 22:46.851
Alright, quick,
just, um...

22:46.900 --> 22:48.106
come up with an idea.

22:48.150 --> 22:49.402
Just -- Sky's the limit.
Go, go, go.

22:49.450 --> 22:50.565
Uh...okay.

22:50.620 --> 22:53.021
Uh...uh...

22:53.080 --> 22:57.574
this is bonkers, but what if
we got a British phone booth,

22:57.620 --> 23:00.999
we put it over here, and made
a sort of speakeasy entrance.

23:01.040 --> 23:02.781
That is cool.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.126
Come on, bro!

23:04.170 --> 23:06.002
Let's do this!

23:06.050 --> 23:07.415
What do you got
to lose?

23:07.470 --> 23:09.256
Literally everything.

23:09.300 --> 23:11.632
But you also have
so much to gain.

23:11.680 --> 23:16.095
You hate your job, and this
could make you so happy.

23:16.140 --> 23:19.474
This could be the new adventure
you've been looking for.

23:19.520 --> 23:21.397
And we'll have a blast.

23:21.440 --> 23:24.182
My out-of-the-box
thinking with your...

23:24.230 --> 23:26.392
everything else.

23:26.440 --> 23:28.397
What do you think?

23:32.240 --> 23:34.481
I'll think about it.

23:34.530 --> 23:36.112
-Yes!
-High five.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.446
Dude,
"I'll think about it"

23:37.500 --> 23:39.150
is not really
a high-five opportunity.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.451
-Or a low five.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.377
Got it.
He'll think about it.

23:46.000 --> 23:49.129
-Oh, hey, sweetie.
-Hey.

23:49.170 --> 23:50.968
Oh.

23:51.010 --> 23:53.968
Are -- I hope this
isn't for my book.

23:54.010 --> 23:55.000
It definitely is.

23:55.050 --> 23:56.381
See the cat there?

23:56.430 --> 23:58.808
Barely,
but I do see a snail.

23:58.850 --> 24:00.591
The cat has a pet snail.

24:00.640 --> 24:04.304
It joins in on the journey,
so it's not so predictable.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.101
Mom, there are no snails
in my book.

24:06.150 --> 24:07.436
I just thought I'd add

24:07.480 --> 24:09.482
a little bit
of creativity, sweetie.

24:09.530 --> 24:12.693
Okay, so now my book
is neither fun nor creative.

24:12.740 --> 24:14.276
-I didn't say that.
-This is ridiculous.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.527
I never should have
agreed to this.

24:16.580 --> 24:18.230
What do you mean
by "agree to this"?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.440
You asked me to help you.
-No, I didn't!

24:20.500 --> 24:22.207
I let you in on it as a favor
because Dad feels bad

24:22.250 --> 24:23.706
that you've got nothing
going on in your life.

24:28.210 --> 24:31.510
M-- Mom, I --

24:38.470 --> 24:41.223
Hey, hey,
I'm so sorry I'm late.

24:41.270 --> 24:43.011
Got stuck at the bar.
-Right.

24:43.060 --> 24:45.688
Stella mentioned you're opening
a bar with her brother?

24:45.730 --> 24:47.767
I'm thinking about it.

24:47.820 --> 24:49.185
It would make you happy.

24:49.230 --> 24:52.313
I can tell.
He -- He's nervous.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.566
Understandably.

24:53.610 --> 24:56.693
My brother has had
a colorful history.

24:56.740 --> 24:58.572
Why are you hesitating on this?

24:58.620 --> 25:01.612
It's not Aiden, Stella.

25:04.330 --> 25:05.991
Wes?

25:06.040 --> 25:08.031
Okay, if I'm gonna
be honest, it just --

25:08.090 --> 25:11.299
it does feel a little hard
to make plans

25:11.340 --> 25:15.789
to start a business
with her brother when we...

25:15.840 --> 25:17.797
When we what?

25:20.100 --> 25:22.592
When we don't know
how it's gonna turn out.

25:25.100 --> 25:26.932
What are you saying?

25:29.230 --> 25:32.188
We don't know how our
marriage will turn out?

25:34.650 --> 25:36.982
Well, isn't that what we're
questioning right now?

25:37.030 --> 25:38.441
Isn't that
why we're in therapy?

25:38.490 --> 25:40.401
No, we're in therapy
to work on it,

25:40.450 --> 25:42.908
to make it better,

25:42.950 --> 25:45.829
not to decide if we want
to be in it or not.

25:49.130 --> 25:50.950
Unless -- Is that why
you're here?

26:01.140 --> 26:03.848
Stella: When all else fails,
you call the one person

26:03.890 --> 26:06.097
who always makes
you feel better,

26:06.140 --> 26:08.939
even when you swore
you wouldn't bother him.

26:10.310 --> 26:11.971
-Hi, Stella.
-Hi, Daddy.

26:12.020 --> 26:14.432
If you're too busy to deal
with Abbott chaos right now,

26:14.490 --> 26:16.106
just say so, okay?

26:16.150 --> 26:19.063
Not busy at all.
What's going on?

26:19.120 --> 26:20.610
I think my marriage
is imploding.

26:20.660 --> 26:23.231
Can I come over?

26:23.290 --> 26:26.863
Of course.
I'll see you in a few.

26:41.390 --> 26:43.757
Facing the problems
in your marriage is hard.

26:43.810 --> 26:46.268
Your mom and I
couldn't hack it.

26:46.310 --> 26:48.438
Never even acknowledged
we had problems.

26:48.480 --> 26:51.643
So you're way ahead
of us.

26:51.690 --> 26:54.478
I've just spent all this time
thinking that I was the one

26:54.530 --> 26:57.101
that had to figure out
what I wanted.

26:57.150 --> 26:58.140
And now?

27:00.200 --> 27:03.738
Now I'm worried that
all the sacrifices

27:03.780 --> 27:05.362
he's made to move
our relationship forward

27:05.410 --> 27:08.072
have just moved him
further away

27:08.120 --> 27:11.499
from everything
he wants in life.

27:11.540 --> 27:13.201
And...

27:13.250 --> 27:15.161
I'm so scared
he's gonna quit on us.

27:19.550 --> 27:20.620
Is that Gina?

27:20.680 --> 27:22.466
Yeah, but it's okay.

27:22.510 --> 27:24.638
What? No, Dad.
You have to answer her.

27:24.680 --> 27:26.057
Nah, it could wait.

27:26.100 --> 27:27.090
Why?
What's going on?

27:27.140 --> 27:28.596
Nothing.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.347
Dad.

27:30.390 --> 27:32.722
I was...

27:32.770 --> 27:33.976
I was supposed to go

27:34.020 --> 27:35.647
to this thing
with her tonight,

27:35.690 --> 27:38.273
but I texted her and let her
know that something came up.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.857
Dad, no.

27:40.910 --> 27:43.368
You're -- You're doing
exactly what Wes does.

27:43.410 --> 27:45.196
You're still treating me
like I'm sick,

27:45.240 --> 27:46.696
and you're making
sacrifices

27:46.740 --> 27:48.322
that I know
you're gonna regret.

27:48.370 --> 27:50.452
I will never regret
being there for you.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.286
Will you please
just answer your phone?

27:53.330 --> 27:55.662
-Answer it.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.769
See?
No point.

28:07.810 --> 28:10.051
She broke up with you,
didn't she?

28:10.100 --> 28:11.886
Yep.

28:17.230 --> 28:19.437
Hi, Lizzie.

28:19.490 --> 28:21.640
I'm so sorry for the things
that I said.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.067
I got carried away and --

28:24.120 --> 28:26.191
No, no.
I'm sorry.

28:26.240 --> 28:28.618
Your book is great
the way it is.

28:28.660 --> 28:31.823
Come here.
Look.

28:33.870 --> 28:35.247
Wow.

28:35.290 --> 28:38.339
Mom, this is...

28:39.630 --> 28:42.167
This is exactly it.

28:42.220 --> 28:44.427
You saw what I was imagining
and you made it better.

28:44.470 --> 28:45.540
Really?
You like it?

28:45.590 --> 28:47.046
Mom, I love it.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.467
It's fantastic.

28:49.520 --> 28:50.669
Thank you, Lizzie.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.848
I really needed this.

28:52.890 --> 28:54.346
Hey, don't thank me.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.641
You're really talented.

28:56.690 --> 29:00.149
I don't mean about work.

29:00.190 --> 29:03.740
I mean...this.

29:03.780 --> 29:06.943
Hey, do you remember
when you were 12

29:06.990 --> 29:08.617
and you were just
a little bit too old

29:08.660 --> 29:11.903
to snuggle up
with me in bed?

29:11.950 --> 29:14.829
So you started bringing a book,
and you'd climb in

29:14.870 --> 29:16.747
and we called it
"Reading Club".

29:16.790 --> 29:18.918
Yeah, of course
I remember.

29:18.960 --> 29:23.124
And you'd lie on my shoulder,
reading to yourself,

29:23.170 --> 29:25.298
I had a book, too,

29:25.340 --> 29:29.220
but I didn't read
a word.

29:29.260 --> 29:30.750
I just sat there

29:30.810 --> 29:34.019
soaking in the last moments
of your childhood.

29:34.060 --> 29:36.893
Oh, honey.

29:36.940 --> 29:40.604
I miss that connection.

29:40.650 --> 29:43.312
Me, too, Mom.
Me, too.

29:43.360 --> 29:46.819
Oh, my baby.

29:56.370 --> 29:58.247
Hey, man.

29:58.290 --> 29:59.780
Sorry to bother you.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.128
No bother.
So, make a decision yet?

30:12.680 --> 30:16.799
You know, when Stella
and I got married,

30:16.850 --> 30:20.229
I kept my lease in London.

30:20.270 --> 30:24.389
I had every intention
of going back to my old life.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.351
Just didn't think there'd be
anything here for me

30:26.400 --> 30:28.698
after Stella.

30:28.740 --> 30:30.868
It's okay.

30:30.910 --> 30:34.289
None of us thought
that she'd make it.

30:34.330 --> 30:36.037
But then
she got her cure,

30:36.080 --> 30:38.117
and my whole future
was different.

30:38.170 --> 30:40.707
I was here...

30:40.750 --> 30:42.878
with Stella in Asheville,

30:42.920 --> 30:45.582
with all of you
insane people.

30:45.630 --> 30:46.916
Right?

30:46.970 --> 30:49.883
So let's do this.

30:49.930 --> 30:51.170
I'm sorry, Aiden.

30:51.220 --> 30:53.552
I really wish I could,
but...

30:56.230 --> 30:59.894
...I just don't know if my
marriage is gonna last.

31:02.060 --> 31:06.679
Look, whatever happens
between you and Stella,

31:06.740 --> 31:08.060
we're brothers.

31:08.110 --> 31:10.568
I still want to do this bar
with you, man.

31:10.610 --> 31:12.192
-Yeah!

31:12.240 --> 31:13.480
But for what it's worth,

31:13.530 --> 31:14.827
I think you guys
are gonna make it.

31:18.750 --> 31:20.821
Wish I felt the same way.

31:22.840 --> 31:25.491
I'm sorry, man.
I just...

31:25.550 --> 31:27.507
I can't do this.

31:50.490 --> 31:52.106
Hi, Stell-Belle.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.776
I don't think I'm gonna be
running anymore,

31:53.820 --> 31:55.367
unless someone's
chasing me, so...

31:55.410 --> 31:58.323
-I figured.
-Ahh.

31:58.370 --> 32:01.419
Thank you.

32:06.380 --> 32:08.838
Dad, I'm so sorry
about Gina.

32:08.880 --> 32:11.929
It's not your fault.
It's mine.

32:11.970 --> 32:14.428
I still treat you like you're
the most important thing

32:14.470 --> 32:16.097
in the world.

32:16.140 --> 32:17.676
It's not _
because you're sick.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.223
It's because...

32:20.270 --> 32:23.808
it's true.

32:23.850 --> 32:25.727
How'd things turn out
with you and Wes?

32:25.770 --> 32:26.896
Unh-unh.

32:26.940 --> 32:28.066
We are not talking
about me.

32:28.110 --> 32:29.271
I came here
to check on you.

32:29.320 --> 32:30.481
I'm fine.

32:30.530 --> 32:32.487
I promise.

32:32.530 --> 32:34.988
Gina's probably not
right for me anyway.

32:35.030 --> 32:36.828
She doesn't have kids,
she'll never understand

32:36.870 --> 32:38.690
that part of me,

32:38.740 --> 32:40.697
and anyone who breaks
up over text --

32:40.750 --> 32:43.788
Dad, I know you
really liked her.

32:43.830 --> 32:47.334
I know.
I did.

32:47.380 --> 32:49.371
I do.

32:49.420 --> 32:51.969
Then you have to let her know
that you're in this with her.

32:52.010 --> 32:55.674
You can't just give up.

32:55.720 --> 32:58.257
Neither can you.

33:00.390 --> 33:01.846
Stella: My dad was right.

33:01.890 --> 33:04.473
The problem was...

33:04.520 --> 33:07.148
I wasn't sure what
I really wanted...

33:37.970 --> 33:40.007
...until I was.

33:55.650 --> 33:58.233
Aiden?

33:58.280 --> 33:59.987
I already told you
I can't do --

34:00.030 --> 34:02.579
Hello, Mr. Charles.

34:02.620 --> 34:04.702
Thank you for meeting me.
Please take a seat.

34:04.750 --> 34:06.320
What's going on?

34:06.370 --> 34:09.670
This is a presentation.

34:09.710 --> 34:13.340
So, what this column shows
is how much love I have for you,

34:13.380 --> 34:15.166
which is very high.

34:15.219 --> 34:17.791
Now, compare that with how much
work I am willing to put in,

34:17.840 --> 34:20.047
and I think you can see
how much our relationship

34:20.100 --> 34:21.920
will amortize over five years,

34:21.969 --> 34:24.098
and I think you'll agree
that our marriage

34:24.139 --> 34:26.268
is a pretty solid investment.

34:26.310 --> 34:28.096
That's not
how amortizing works.

34:28.150 --> 34:30.050
On this chart it is.
See, right here.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.397
But let's get down
to the specifics.

34:34.650 --> 34:38.438
I see a fantastic business
opportunity for you here.

34:38.489 --> 34:41.027
A place where your creativity,
your happiness,

34:41.070 --> 34:45.610
and your own-boss-ness shows
potential for tremendous growth.

34:45.659 --> 34:47.071
I'm intrigued.

34:47.120 --> 34:48.952
And...

34:49.000 --> 34:51.958
on this chart you can see
just a small portion

34:52.000 --> 34:53.456
of the proposed sacrifices

34:53.500 --> 34:56.128
I'm willing to make
to enhance that growth,

34:56.170 --> 34:58.298
including getting
a better-paying job

34:58.340 --> 34:59.637
so that I can support
the both of us

34:59.680 --> 35:02.547
in case things go south
with this place.

35:02.600 --> 35:07.674
And selling personal possessions
to invest in what you want.

35:07.730 --> 35:10.267
Like...

35:14.730 --> 35:16.937
Stella, you did not!

35:16.990 --> 35:18.139
I did.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.020
I bought you
a phone booth.

35:20.070 --> 35:21.868
How did you pay
for this?

35:24.700 --> 35:26.657
You sold your ring?!
Stella...

35:26.700 --> 35:28.532
That was
my old wedding ring.

35:35.880 --> 35:38.008
His and her
rubber bands.

35:39.880 --> 35:42.884
Are you sure?

35:42.930 --> 35:46.002
Yes, _
It was never about a ring.

35:46.060 --> 35:49.132
Wes, it was about you.

35:49.180 --> 35:50.386
And I want
a future with you,

35:50.440 --> 35:51.760
and I want
to build it together,

35:51.810 --> 35:53.300
so if you want
to do this bar,

35:53.360 --> 35:57.228
I will do whatever it takes
to show you that I am in.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.523
So, in summation,
Mr. Charles,

36:00.570 --> 36:02.231
let me reiterate

36:02.280 --> 36:06.160
that I see potential
for life-long happiness

36:06.200 --> 36:09.955
and mutually beneficial --
Mm.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.037
Wait, is this how you end
all of your business meetings?

36:12.080 --> 36:15.459
-They were very good charts.

36:15.500 --> 36:18.049
Yeah, you liked those?

36:19.800 --> 36:22.883
I love you,
Stella Abbott.

36:22.930 --> 36:25.092
I love you,
Wes Charles.

36:38.570 --> 36:41.449
Ever feel like
you can't breathe

36:41.490 --> 36:44.448
Does the water feel too deep

36:44.490 --> 36:50.497
Lie awake 'cause
you can't sleep without it

36:50.540 --> 36:53.419
Ever feel like you're alone

36:53.460 --> 36:56.418
When you're lost
but you're already home

36:56.460 --> 37:02.126
Lie awake 'cause
you can't dream without it

37:02.170 --> 37:04.218
It's gonna be alright

37:04.260 --> 37:08.094
Never gonna leave your side

37:08.140 --> 37:12.509
It's gonna be alright

37:12.560 --> 37:14.722
Everybody falls down

37:14.770 --> 37:15.931
All the way down

37:15.980 --> 37:18.267
You just gotta hold on tight

37:18.320 --> 37:19.890
You gotta get up

37:19.940 --> 37:21.897
Gotta get up

37:21.940 --> 37:24.739
Gonna make it
through this time

37:24.780 --> 37:26.771
Everybody falls down

37:26.820 --> 37:28.026
All the way down

37:28.080 --> 37:29.980
You just gotta hold on tight

37:30.040 --> 37:32.361
The next day, Wes and Aiden
officially became partners.

37:32.410 --> 37:33.900
Gotta get up

37:33.960 --> 37:36.452
Gonna make it
through this time

37:41.590 --> 37:43.001
I'm impressed, Aiden.

37:43.050 --> 37:45.758
I've told a lot of guys
to get their act together.

37:45.800 --> 37:48.633
You're the first one
who actually did.

37:48.680 --> 37:50.057
So...

37:50.100 --> 37:52.216
you think you might
eventually be into a guy

37:52.270 --> 37:53.886
who's getting
his life together?

37:53.930 --> 37:57.093
I already am.

37:57.150 --> 38:00.438
Wait, what?

38:00.480 --> 38:02.608
I like you, Aiden.

38:02.650 --> 38:04.277
As more than friends?

38:04.320 --> 38:06.140
Way more than.

38:06.200 --> 38:08.737
That's -- Okay.

38:08.780 --> 38:11.533
So, I've never made
the transition from friend

38:11.580 --> 38:14.993
to more-than, so I'm not sure
what we should do next.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.702
What should we do next?

38:17.750 --> 38:19.536
We say goodbye.

38:19.580 --> 38:21.662
See, we're already having
our first disagreement

38:21.710 --> 38:23.166
because that does not
sound like

38:23.210 --> 38:25.338
a way-more-than
thing to do.

38:27.380 --> 38:29.792
Wait, you're serious.

38:29.850 --> 38:31.420
Project Build + Better
offered me a job

38:31.470 --> 38:34.349
in management
in South America.

38:34.390 --> 38:35.767
It's a chance to give back

38:35.810 --> 38:37.630
in a way
I thought I never could.

38:45.940 --> 38:47.522
You have to go.

38:47.570 --> 38:49.982
You have to.

38:50.030 --> 38:51.486
Thanks
for understanding.

38:59.580 --> 39:01.127
Bye, Aiden.

39:01.170 --> 39:03.047
Everybody falls down,
all the way down

39:03.090 --> 39:04.080
You just gotta
hold on tight

39:04.130 --> 39:06.713
Bye?
That's it?

39:06.760 --> 39:09.081
I'm just supposed
to forget about you?

39:09.130 --> 39:10.507
You're not gonna
forget me.

39:10.550 --> 39:12.177
Gonna make it
through this time

39:12.220 --> 39:15.053
Everybody falls down,
all the way down

39:15.100 --> 39:17.728
You just gotta hold on tight

39:17.770 --> 39:20.933
You gotta get up,
gotta get up

39:20.980 --> 39:24.473
Gonna make it
through this time

39:33.830 --> 39:36.071
Now you won't forget
about me either.

39:42.000 --> 39:44.412
Well?
Did they like it?

39:44.460 --> 39:46.918
They're gonna
publish my book!

39:46.960 --> 39:50.794
Oh, Lizzie!
I'm so proud of you!

39:50.840 --> 39:52.422
Honey!

39:52.470 --> 39:54.461
And they had some ideas
of amazing illustrators

39:54.510 --> 39:55.500
that they want
to pair me with.

39:55.560 --> 39:56.925
That's wonderful!

39:56.970 --> 39:58.631
But I told them there's
only one illustrator

39:58.680 --> 40:00.262
who really gets my voice.

40:00.310 --> 40:02.688
Who is it?

40:02.730 --> 40:04.607
You, dummy!

40:04.650 --> 40:06.061
Shut your mouth.

40:06.110 --> 40:08.681
You're officially a
children's book illustrator.

40:11.530 --> 40:12.986
Please don't shut
the door.

40:13.030 --> 40:15.522
-I actually want --
-'Cause I think that --

40:18.700 --> 40:20.657
I'm sorry.

40:20.710 --> 40:22.530
She's your daughter,
and I should've at least --

40:22.580 --> 40:24.321
No, you were right.

40:24.380 --> 40:28.089
I think maybe I was hiding
behind my family because...

40:28.130 --> 40:30.872
this could be
something real.

40:30.920 --> 40:33.298
The last real thing
I had...

40:33.340 --> 40:35.968
I screwed up.

40:36.010 --> 40:38.763
Well, if you want
to screw this up...

40:38.810 --> 40:41.472
you're gonna have to try
a lot harder than that.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.608
So there we were,
putting in the work.

40:50.650 --> 40:53.028
You just gotta hold on tight

40:53.070 --> 40:54.902
You gotta get up

40:54.950 --> 40:56.657
Gotta get up

40:56.700 --> 40:58.987
Gonna make it
through this time

40:59.040 --> 41:00.906
Everybody falls down,
all the way down

41:00.950 --> 41:05.456
It wasn't going to be easy, but
nothing worth doing ever is.

41:05.500 --> 41:07.286
You gotta get up

41:07.340 --> 41:08.705
Gotta get up

41:08.750 --> 41:11.503
Gonna make it
through this time

41:11.550 --> 41:13.086
Time

41:13.130 --> 41:14.507
Time

41:14.550 --> 41:17.508
Gonna make it through
this time

41:17.550 --> 41:19.177
Time

41:19.220 --> 41:20.631
Time

41:20.680 --> 41:23.513
Gonna make it through
this time

41:23.560 --> 41:25.346
Time

41:25.400 --> 41:26.765
Time

41:26.810 --> 41:29.859
Gonna make it through
this time

41:29.900 --> 41:31.811
And the best part was

41:31.860 --> 41:35.353
we were all looking
towards our future...

41:35.410 --> 41:36.730
together.
