00:02.520 --> 00:04.320
TARA NARRATING: Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.360 --> 00:06.320
-Uh, third years, I'd like
to introduce Marcus Kane,

00:06.360 --> 00:08.359
artistic director of
the Austin Ballet.

00:08.400 --> 00:10.400
-You crazy kids are in love?

00:10.439 --> 00:12.720
-So you just bat those sleepy
lashes, and the academy begs

00:12.759 --> 00:13.640
you to come back?

00:13.679 --> 00:15.160
-I have friends in
high places.

00:15.199 --> 00:17.800
-Well, Christian and I could
do one-on-one classes.

00:17.839 --> 00:19.640
It'd only be, what, an extra
10 or 12 hour a week?

00:19.679 --> 00:21.839
-Have you stopped to think about
why Saskia wants to help

00:21.879 --> 00:23.239
you?

00:23.280 --> 00:24.600
-Look, Saskia sees something
in me, something special.

00:24.640 --> 00:26.640
But you clearly don't, do you?

00:26.679 --> 00:28.640
[theme music]

01:11.680 --> 01:13.079
[music playing]

01:13.120 --> 01:13.599
-[singing]

01:13.640 --> 01:14.879
See me, see you.

01:14.920 --> 01:16.480
I think you might be God,
but I'm coming through.

01:16.519 --> 01:17.920
TARA NARRATING: Patterns--

01:17.959 --> 01:20.480
when you look hard enough, you
realize they're absolutely

01:20.519 --> 01:21.040
everywhere.

01:21.079 --> 01:22.079
-[singing]

01:22.120 --> 01:23.159
So you wanna roll with
the chief, huh?

01:23.200 --> 01:24.640
Well, we could just
roll like Caesar.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.120
TARA NARRATING: In every song.

01:26.159 --> 01:27.120
[audience applauding]

01:27.159 --> 01:30.519
TARA NARRATING: In every bow.

01:30.560 --> 01:33.480
-OK, ladies, your bourees
were generally lazy

01:33.519 --> 01:34.879
in the second act.

01:34.920 --> 01:36.560
And I want to reiterate that
absolutely no one is to be

01:36.599 --> 01:37.760
even a millimeter
out of alignment

01:37.799 --> 01:39.560
for the gala matinee.

01:39.599 --> 01:42.200
Tara, your arabesques are still
two inches lower than

01:42.239 --> 01:44.079
everybody else.

01:44.120 --> 01:45.480
-And Grace?

01:45.519 --> 01:47.079
Sir Jeffrey has requested
that you become

01:47.120 --> 01:48.319
familiar with ellipses.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.799
-Does that I what I
think it means?

01:52.840 --> 01:53.719
-Congrats, babe.

01:53.760 --> 01:55.640
-I'm coming on tour!

01:55.680 --> 01:57.000
-Yay!

01:57.040 --> 01:58.640
TARA NARRATING: Then there are
our negative patterns.

01:58.680 --> 01:59.799
-Show me.

01:59.840 --> 02:01.159
TARA NARRATING: Those
pesky spin cycles we

02:01.200 --> 02:03.120
find ourselves in.

02:03.159 --> 02:05.040
-You're a smart boy, making
yourself indispensable.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.560
I wouldn't keep Saskia
waiting.

02:09.598 --> 02:11.199
She gets cranky when
you do that.

02:14.080 --> 02:15.759
TARA NARRATING: By now, I have
a fairly good idea of my

02:15.800 --> 02:17.159
trademarked patterns of
self-destruction.

02:23.400 --> 02:26.199
For instance, how I never
appreciate what I've

02:26.240 --> 02:28.159
got until it's gone.

02:28.199 --> 02:32.400
And then I miss it so much I
can hardly see straight.

02:32.439 --> 02:34.520
-I'm booking a breakfast
tomorrow.

02:34.560 --> 02:35.840
You, me, Sir Jeffrey.

02:35.879 --> 02:38.800
We need to talk about
your future.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.159
TARA NARRATING: Unfortunately,
being aware of our negative

02:41.199 --> 02:44.080
patterns doesn't mean we have
the slightest idea how to

02:44.120 --> 02:44.599
break them.

02:44.639 --> 02:45.159
[music playing]

02:45.199 --> 02:45.919
-[singing]

02:45.960 --> 02:47.080
You think you got it, boy.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.479
You think you know it all.

02:48.520 --> 02:50.159
This world is big and bad.

02:50.199 --> 02:52.800
You don't know what
it's got in store.

02:52.840 --> 02:56.680
You gotta fight so--

02:56.719 --> 02:58.000
-Well, good.

02:58.039 --> 02:59.039
I'm sure we'll get it next time,
as long as we're not

02:59.080 --> 03:00.439
interrupted.

03:00.479 --> 03:03.560
-You're a real team player
these days, Beyonce.

03:03.599 --> 03:05.120
-We're making a music video.

03:05.159 --> 03:06.479
-Ah.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.800
-We'll leave it on.

03:07.840 --> 03:09.360
-[laughs]

03:09.400 --> 03:10.319
-Darling.

03:10.360 --> 03:11.280
-(DELIGHTEDLY) Oh.

03:11.319 --> 03:12.240
[both making kissing sounds]

03:12.280 --> 03:13.280
-Benjamin.

03:13.319 --> 03:14.319
Oh.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.840
Now what's this I hear
about you, uh,

03:15.879 --> 03:17.719
being the next Nijinsky?

03:17.759 --> 03:19.120
-Really?

03:22.280 --> 03:23.240
[chuckles]

03:23.280 --> 03:25.479
-Oh, stuff is like chili
on steroids.

03:25.520 --> 03:26.680
-Yeah, my back's used to it.

03:26.719 --> 03:29.240
But make sure you
wash your hands.

03:29.280 --> 03:32.639
Now the literature says that
we have to replace your

03:32.680 --> 03:34.159
trigger points with
fun distractions.

03:34.199 --> 03:35.759
What are your thoughts
on archery?

03:35.800 --> 03:36.840
-[sighs]

03:36.879 --> 03:39.319
T, I appreciate your
unbridled support.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.800
But you have a gala focus on.

03:40.840 --> 03:41.479
-No, this is--

03:41.520 --> 03:42.840
-I'm serious.

03:42.879 --> 03:44.560
If I see your pretty face
between now and then, I'm

03:44.599 --> 03:47.159
going to vomit, just
on principle.

03:47.199 --> 03:48.039
-Bulimia humor.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.400
LOL.

03:49.439 --> 03:52.759
-Funny, yet deflective.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.719
-No, mom, no.

03:53.759 --> 03:55.080
That's exceptional.

03:55.120 --> 03:58.240
Um, the film crew is booked for
tomorrow, so I need your

03:58.280 --> 03:59.599
help recruiting dancers.

03:59.639 --> 04:01.439
We're gonna step this up.

04:01.479 --> 04:02.719
-Whoo!

04:02.759 --> 04:04.800
Fun distractions, you say?

04:04.840 --> 04:07.479
Tara, I believe it's time to
leave her with the babysitter.

04:07.520 --> 04:08.319
-Yay.

04:08.360 --> 04:09.400
This is perfect.

04:09.439 --> 04:10.319
-Yay.

04:10.360 --> 04:11.439
-People, please.

04:11.479 --> 04:13.439
Can we just take a stab
at normality?

04:13.479 --> 04:15.520
Give me some boy problems
to ponder.

04:15.560 --> 04:17.720
-I've got nothing.

04:17.759 --> 04:19.040
-What?

04:19.079 --> 04:22.199
Not even those sordid rumors
about Saskia and Ben?

04:22.240 --> 04:25.160
-I had a gorgeous guy with a
heart the size of Sydney

04:25.199 --> 04:27.240
Harbour, who I absolutely didn't
deserve, and I stuffed

04:27.279 --> 04:28.600
it up again.

04:28.639 --> 04:30.639
-Usually this is where you break
the land speed record to

04:30.680 --> 04:31.920
stalk your way back in.

04:31.959 --> 04:34.600
-This time, I am accepting
that he's gone and doing

04:34.639 --> 04:36.319
absolutely nothing.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.519
Breaking the pattern.

04:50.759 --> 04:52.720
-Such an irresponsible
present.

04:52.759 --> 04:54.800
I told Marcus I didn't have
time to take care of an

04:54.839 --> 04:55.480
animal.

04:55.519 --> 04:57.319
-I say get rid of him.

04:57.360 --> 04:58.639
The kitten, not Marcus.

05:02.079 --> 05:03.160
How's that?

05:03.199 --> 05:03.920
-Good.

05:03.959 --> 05:04.839
Release from your center.

05:04.879 --> 05:06.279
[kitten mews]

05:06.319 --> 05:09.160
-Isabelle says that Eloise, you
know the girl whose place

05:09.199 --> 05:10.199
I'm taking on the tour--

05:10.240 --> 05:11.839
-Whose place you're
probably taking.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.480
They say it isn't confirmed.

05:13.519 --> 05:14.519
-Right.

05:14.560 --> 05:16.639
Well, her dad is, like,
on a respirator.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.399
So unlikely she'll
make it back.

05:19.439 --> 05:21.439
How sad is that?

05:21.480 --> 05:22.639
-I think you missed
the sissonne.

05:25.439 --> 05:26.560
-Doesn't it feel like
everything's

05:26.600 --> 05:28.639
working out for us?

05:28.680 --> 05:31.480
You have Marcus and
the furball.

05:31.519 --> 05:32.759
And I have the company.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.399
Girls there are so much
more on my level.

05:35.439 --> 05:37.399
-I'm proud.

05:37.439 --> 05:38.839
How far you've come this year.

05:38.879 --> 05:39.639
-[chuckles]

05:39.680 --> 05:42.639
Thanks, Lucy.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.600
-And that hack from "The Herald"
has the nerve to call

05:45.639 --> 05:48.680
us dated, as if respecting
the classics is

05:48.720 --> 05:50.839
akin to being lazy.

05:50.879 --> 05:54.040
What do you think of the
repertoire, Ben?

05:54.079 --> 05:57.160
-Oh, I like the classics,
sir, yeah.

05:57.199 --> 05:58.680
-That's an understatement.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.600
We've been working on the
Black Swan pas de deux.

06:00.639 --> 06:03.160
And someone needs to explain to
me why he isn't a full-time

06:03.199 --> 06:03.720
member of the company--

06:03.759 --> 06:04.839
-[coughs]

06:04.879 --> 06:05.759
---given he's at soloist
standard already.

06:05.800 --> 06:06.439
-[coughing]

06:06.480 --> 06:07.879
-He's still a student.

06:07.920 --> 06:10.319
-Well, is that an excuse to
deprive the dance world any

06:10.360 --> 06:11.759
longer?

06:11.800 --> 06:13.519
-Darling, I have no problem
arranging and early audition

06:13.560 --> 06:17.279
after the gala madness
is over.

06:17.319 --> 06:19.519
You'll keep that on
the down low?

06:19.560 --> 06:20.199
-Of course.

06:20.240 --> 06:20.879
Yes.

06:20.920 --> 06:21.519
Thank you, Sir Jeffrey.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.279
-[clears throat]

06:24.319 --> 06:25.560
Walk me back.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.319
-Will do.

06:26.360 --> 06:26.839
I'll catch you later.

06:26.879 --> 06:27.560
-Yeah, thanks.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.120
Ta.

06:29.160 --> 06:32.040
-Now, speaking of partners,
have you noticed Hugo's

06:32.079 --> 06:34.399
looking a little disheveled
lately?

06:34.439 --> 06:36.360
-You don't have to audition
early, if you decide

06:36.399 --> 06:37.560
you don't want to.

06:37.600 --> 06:38.839
-It's the company.

06:38.879 --> 06:40.839
-First impressions count
with Sir Jeffrey.

06:40.879 --> 06:43.319
If he's underwhelmed now, it
could affect your chances at

06:43.360 --> 06:45.560
the end of the year.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.199
-I'll just have to
be awesome then.

06:48.240 --> 06:52.079
[chuckles]

06:52.120 --> 06:53.680
-Ah, congratulations,
gentleman.

06:53.720 --> 06:55.120
Only 40 minutes late.

06:55.160 --> 06:58.199
-I had a breakfast meeting.

06:58.240 --> 07:00.120
-Hence the lipstick
on your cheek?

07:00.160 --> 07:01.800
-Saskia dance me close.

07:01.839 --> 07:04.399
-I don't even want to know
what that means.

07:04.439 --> 07:06.040
-What about you, Christian?

07:06.079 --> 07:08.800
-Oh, snooze button hates me.

07:08.839 --> 07:11.240
-That's fine, but, uh, do us
all a favor and pull your

07:11.279 --> 07:12.360
tights up, huh?

07:12.399 --> 07:14.519
-Do you have any feedback
for us, Zach?

07:14.560 --> 07:15.759
You know, the ones who were
actually dancing?

07:15.800 --> 07:16.399
-Come on.

07:16.439 --> 07:17.079
Don't be needy.

07:17.120 --> 07:18.160
Ladies, travel it.

07:18.199 --> 07:20.279
And--

07:20.319 --> 07:21.439
-Hey, wonderboy.

07:21.480 --> 07:23.680
I can continue on you
tomorrow, yeah?

07:23.720 --> 07:26.439
I mean it's not interrupting
any special time with Zach?

07:32.680 --> 07:33.680
-Hey, Zach.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.480
Um, about my next couple
of sessions--

07:36.519 --> 07:37.680
-Yeah.

07:37.720 --> 07:38.319
I was thinking maybe you
could help me workshop

07:38.360 --> 07:39.600
the third year tour.

07:39.639 --> 07:41.040
We're doing "Romeo
and Juliet," but

07:41.079 --> 07:42.480
a more modern version.

07:42.519 --> 07:44.680
How would you feel
about Romeo?

07:44.720 --> 07:46.079
-Wouldn't that be
sort of a lead?

07:46.120 --> 07:47.360
-Well, it's not an offer.

07:47.399 --> 07:49.399
You'd still need to get those
classes caught up.

07:49.439 --> 07:52.399
-The thing is, Ollie's planning
this film clip, asked

07:52.439 --> 07:53.480
me to help.

07:53.519 --> 07:54.480
Directing that could
count towards some

07:54.519 --> 07:56.839
of my catch-up hours.

07:56.879 --> 07:58.199
-Second group, ready to go.

08:02.360 --> 08:05.519
-Sorry, I guess it's not like
dancing with a principal.

08:05.560 --> 08:07.360
-Nope.

08:07.399 --> 08:09.199
-[sighs]

08:09.240 --> 08:10.680
I don't want to encroach
on your space.

08:10.720 --> 08:13.600
But if it helps, I know I was
totally self-absorbed to say

08:13.639 --> 08:14.120
that--

08:14.160 --> 08:15.639
-What?

08:15.680 --> 08:16.560
That Saskia would fake believe
in me as a weird revenge plot

08:16.600 --> 08:18.399
just to get back at you?

08:18.439 --> 08:19.439
-Yeah.

08:19.480 --> 08:20.639
Plus, she's seriously
beautiful, and--

08:20.680 --> 08:22.839
-You people and your
sick minds.

08:22.879 --> 08:24.560
You think I'm dating
Saskia too?

08:24.600 --> 08:25.800
-Not to get ahead
in the company.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.560
I, I would never listen to
any of those rumors.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.079
But [sighs]

08:29.120 --> 08:31.079
you can date her,
if you want to.

08:31.120 --> 08:32.440
-Thanks heaps for
your permission.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.440
-Don't you have a home to

is a huge concession.

Definitely not what Miss Raine
had in mind when we said we'd

08:51.759 --> 08:53.200
make up your class.

Um, thank you all for giving
your time today.

up, just go back to makeup.

-Kat's the only one here with
professional music video

09:32.240 --> 09:33.320

09:33.360 --> 09:34.799
-Maybe it's the choreo
that's awkward.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.799
Maybe instead of a freeze, it
should be a elbow stand.

09:40.679 --> 09:42.600
-I don't hate that.

-You're overruled.

It doesn't go as well
with the lyrics.

Christian's move in the

the call then.

18:29.440 --> 18:31.400
And the thing is you
always come back.

18:31.440 --> 18:34.319
Because the real problem I don't
think has anything to do

18:34.359 --> 18:36.160
with dance.

18:36.200 --> 18:38.680
-Tell me, Zach, what's
my real problem?

18:38.720 --> 18:40.160
-You don't respect yourself.

18:40.200 --> 18:41.640
You don't respect your talent.

18:41.680 --> 18:44.759
And you hate people who do,
because deep down, I don't

18:44.799 --> 18:47.400
know, maybe you hate yourself.

18:47.440 --> 18:50.759
Whatever it is, it started
way before Sammy, so

18:50.799 --> 18:52.759
don't you blame him.

18:52.799 --> 18:53.599
Right?

18:53.640 --> 18:54.880
And you need to sort this out.

18:54.920 --> 18:59.279
Otherwise it will dictate
the rest of your life.

18:59.319 --> 19:00.680
-Is that it?

19:00.720 --> 19:02.640
You done?

19:02.680 --> 19:04.039
-Yeah.

19:07.240 --> 19:08.400
Good luck, Christian.

19:46.480 --> 19:47.799
-Consider this your
company audition.

19:53.440 --> 20:06.359
[audience applauding]

20:06.400 --> 20:08.359
[music playing]

20:41.759 --> 20:48.279

20:48.319 --> 20:50.279

21:33.240 --> 21:35.160

-[groans]

21:38.319 --> 21:40.200
[audience murmuring]

21:43.240 --> 21:44.400
-No.

22:00.160 --> 22:01.759
TARA NARRATING: Maybe breaking
your pattern is a bit like one

22:01.799 --> 22:03.559
of those Magic Eye paintings.

22:03.599 --> 22:05.640
You have to look at things
from the right angle.

22:08.519 --> 22:09.720
-No.

22:12.440 --> 22:13.799
-What are you doing?

22:21.240 --> 22:24.119
TARA NARRATING: I'm forever
fixating on how I feel, what I

22:24.160 --> 22:27.119
need to do when I could be
focusing on what someone else

22:27.160 --> 22:29.799
might need from me.

22:29.839 --> 22:31.759
-[laughs]

22:38.720 --> 22:42.200
-[laughs]

22:42.240 --> 22:43.200
-(QUIETLY) Drop the curtain.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.200
Drop it now!

22:45.240 --> 22:47.559
TARA NARRATING: Passions
are so ingrained in us.

22:47.599 --> 22:49.200
It's like they're in control,
and we don't even know it.

22:55.279 --> 22:56.599
-[gasps]

22:56.640 --> 22:58.200
-I just heard about the tour.

22:58.240 --> 23:00.279
-And you blew off a night
of happy families

23:00.319 --> 23:01.759
to pretend you care?

23:01.799 --> 23:04.640
What you don't get is that I
don't need the company, and I

23:04.680 --> 23:05.799
don't need you.

23:05.839 --> 23:07.640
I don't need anyone.

23:07.680 --> 23:10.279
-Grace, what happened?

23:13.319 --> 23:15.640
-[crying]

23:15.680 --> 23:17.480
TARA NARRATING: If we could just
find the circuit breaker,

23:17.519 --> 23:18.799
we could stop the
slightest tremor

23:18.839 --> 23:22.160
from becoming a landslide.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.640
[music playing]

23:23.680 --> 23:25.480
TARA NARRATING: Let go of
the need to be a star.

23:34.759 --> 23:36.599
Go back and face our demons.

23:43.319 --> 23:44.279
-[sighs]

23:44.319 --> 23:47.480
-This is not some school
production.

23:47.519 --> 23:50.839
In my professional career, I
have never been so humiliated.

23:50.880 --> 23:53.799
It is abundantly clear that
neither of you is ready to be

23:53.839 --> 23:55.799
part of this company.

23:55.839 --> 23:56.759
TARA NARRATING: Breaking
a pattern might

23:56.799 --> 23:58.279
get a little messy.

23:58.319 --> 24:01.720
But it could also create room
for a new one to form, one you

24:01.759 --> 24:03.119
definitely want to hold onto.

24:05.519 --> 24:07.319
