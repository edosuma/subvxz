<i>Since then, most of the continents
have sunk into the sea,</i>

00:45.503 --> 00:49.007
<i>and the Korean Peninsula
has turned into a desert.</i>

00:54.554 --> 00:57.223
<i>Only 1% of the population survived.</i>

00:59.059 --> 01:02.937
<i>These survivors needed
new technology and a new social order.</i>

01:07.108 --> 01:09.069
<i>To deal with the polluted atmosphere,</i>

01:09.069 --> 01:13.031
<i>a gigantic Air Core was built
to convert oxyanium into oxygen.</i>

01:17.077 --> 01:20.830
<i>And the scarcity of resources
led to a division of the population,</i>

01:20.830 --> 01:26.419

<i>labeled as refugees.</i>

01:40.475 --> 01:41.976
<i>Some of these refugees,</i>

01:41.976 --> 01:45.438
<i>tired of the discrimination,
starvation, and lack of oxygen</i>,

01:45.438 --> 01:48.399
<i>became hunters

01:50.944 --> 01:52.070

<i>We deliver the oxygen and necessities

and their attacks,</i>

<i>and arrive on time
at the designated place without fail.</i>

02:17.428 --> 02:18.930
<i>Deliverymen have to be strong.</i>

02:18.930 --> 02:21.141
<i>Deliverymen have to keep cool
under pressure.</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:24.435
<i>They have to risk their lives
to protect their cargo from hunters.</i>

02:36.489 --> 02:41.077
<i>This is the reason people dream
of becoming deliverymen.</i>

02:44.914 --> 02:48.293
<i>Especially for the refugees
who don't have QR codes,</i>

02:49.377 --> 02:51.921

03:40.428 --> 03:41.512
- What?
- Yeah?

We just might be the cowards.

03:43.056 --> 03:45.350
We're not even fighting them,
we're just watching.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.562

- Don't nag me, son.

08:10.198 --> 08:11.866
Hey, man. We have to make a living too.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.035

11:06.707 --> 11:08.542
- No!
- Please, let him go!

11:09.418 --> 11:11.379

11:11.379 --> 11:13.381

12:02.346 --> 12:03.931

12:03.931 --> 12:05.182
I was trying.

12:09.186 --> 12:12.690
There are two people wrecking the place,
and I'm the only person cleaning.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.318
Ow, my back.

12:22.116 --> 12:24.785
I warned you
that it's refugee crackdown period,

12:24.785 --> 12:27.705
and you've been out there wandering about
using up our supplies.

12:32.334 --> 12:34.295
I mean, I do win, at least,

12:34.295 --> 12:36.797
and then I win again,
and then, oh my God, I win some more.

12:36.797 --> 12:39.425
And now, you know,
there's no one to challenge me.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.094
You see, all of this
is just part of the train--

12:42.094 --> 12:45.598
Challenge you? Training?
As a deliveryman, huh?

12:47.099 --> 12:49.643
But, Unni, uh,
I actually think he could do it.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.021
I've seen him fight
a few times.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.273
He's definitely much stronger than he was.

12:55.733 --> 12:57.735
So you've been going out there
as well, huh?

12:57.735 --> 13:00.237
You should've stopped him.
You're better than that!

13:01.197 --> 13:02.239
Drop down, now.

13:04.408 --> 13:05.242
Me too?

13:05.242 --> 13:06.869
No, don't do that, Noona.

13:07.536 --> 13:09.622
It's all my fault. She did nothing wrong.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.123
Just punish me. Just me. Yeah.

13:11.123 --> 13:12.041
Here.

13:14.627 --> 13:16.670
You think anybody can be a deliveryman?

13:17.171 --> 13:19.048
You think being immature
and fighting everyone

13:19.048 --> 13:20.549
makes you a general citizen?

13:21.050 --> 13:22.843
I promised you I'll find a way.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.053
You promise me?

13:24.845 --> 13:26.722
- You promise me, seriously?
- What?

13:26.722 --> 13:28.974
You got another code implant lying around?

13:30.893 --> 13:34.104
I'm sure you're worried about harboring a
refugee Ms. Major at Defense Intelligence.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.022
So, what?

13:35.940 --> 13:38.442
- Gonna go buy me someone's hand?
-<i>Oppa</i>!

13:38.442 --> 13:40.736
And not just a few days,
it's been ten years.

13:42.071 --> 13:44.532
This way you've been referring to
isn't even possible.

13:44.532 --> 13:46.742
So don't do anything anymore.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.911
I don't wanna put you in danger.

13:49.453 --> 13:50.412
Either of you.

13:50.412 --> 13:52.665
I don't wanna put myself in danger either.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.917
So, don't be making dumb choices
and just stay inside.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.794

is if I get lost.

13:56.794 --> 13:57.837

14:06.679 --> 14:08.389
So what about your bright future?

14:11.183 --> 14:12.268
You let me down.

14:12.268 --> 14:13.352
What?

14:13.352 --> 14:14.436
"What?"

14:18.774 --> 14:20.734
You won't be a deliveryman

14:29.493 --> 14:30.744

14:30.744 --> 14:33.414
Look here, Major Jung Seol-ah,
you're being so unfair.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.957
Aww.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.334
- Fifteen days.
- Fifteen, yeah.

14:37.918 --> 14:41.005
Fifteen days, starting tomorrow.
I'll keep him right in line.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.381

14:43.883 --> 14:44.800
Okay, I'll do a week.

14:44.800 --> 14:45.968

Madam President,

17:56.742 --> 17:59.745
how bad is the situation
in the Special District?

17:59.745 --> 18:01.288
Population's out of control.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.040
Can't see the forests or the sky,

18:03.040 --> 18:05.667

18:08.420 --> 18:09.713
It's inevitable, though.

18:09.713 --> 18:13.884
That's why this relocation plan

18:21.433 --> 18:23.310
There have been so many issues.

18:23.894 --> 18:27.147
I guess I really screwed up
when I was designing the place.

18:28.273 --> 18:31.068
It's only been 40 years
since you made all of this here.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.071
You dug five kilometers below ground

18:34.071 --> 18:36.740
and built this world
in such a short period of time.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.827
And then once District A's been finished,

18:39.827 --> 18:43.956
you will have created a new environment

18:43.956 --> 18:45.833
Thank you for saying that.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.460
I'm old and fear I'm losing my confidence.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.670
I'm so full of regret.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.713
What are you saying?

18:51.713 --> 18:53.590
You're still strong and healthy.

18:54.174 --> 18:57.261
Don't let those bad thoughts in,
just focus on the relocation.

18:59.471 --> 19:03.892
It sounds to me like maybe you want me
to finish the plan and then die.

19:06.979 --> 19:09.481
I didn't know you were here,
Madam President.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.024
Is this private?

19:11.024 --> 19:12.651
No, we were waiting for you.

I apologize.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.649
So when should I expect it?

19:59.072 --> 20:00.866

isn't helping us. Listen to me.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.283

that Cheonmyeong is yours now?

20:44.660 --> 20:46.828
I don't, Father. You are Cheonmyeong.

20:46.828 --> 20:49.331

21:27.119 --> 21:28.036
Where are you?

21:29.621 --> 21:30.580
Grandpa!

21:31.164 --> 21:33.000
Jeez, you're so loud!

21:33.000 --> 21:33.917
Hey!

21:34.751 --> 21:35.919
So you're still kicking, huh?

21:35.919 --> 21:36.920
You little punk.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.131
I'll have you know
that I have no plans of dying

21:39.131 --> 21:41.258
until I fix that rude mouth of yours.

21:41.258 --> 21:43.218
You got that, kid? Huh, huh?

21:43.218 --> 21:44.553
That pinches!

21:45.095 --> 21:47.514
I was never properly educated,
that's why I speak like that.

21:47.514 --> 21:50.309
Hey, unschooled Sa-wol,
some of us are trying to learn.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.227
Grandpa told us it makes us all better.

21:52.227 --> 21:55.480
Oh, he told you that?
Well, I think better is too freakin' hard.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.773
Let's go out, get better later.

21:56.773 --> 21:57.858
- Out?
- Out where?

21:57.858 --> 21:59.443
I'm grounded starting tomorrow.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.569
Let's get in trouble today.

22:13.874 --> 22:16.168
SLOW

22:21.548 --> 22:23.467
<i>Air pollution level rising.</i>

22:27.346 --> 22:28.180
Let's go.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.607
<i>30 km/hour speed limit zone.
Automatically decelerating.</i>

22:38.607 --> 22:39.983

22:51.161 --> 22:53.246
Useless! Run faster, hurry!

23:03.590 --> 23:04.758
You go up first.

23:27.697 --> 23:30.200
Kids go bonkers
when the world goes to hell.

23:32.202 --> 23:34.663
We're going to crash! Get down!

24:14.786 --> 24:16.288
See ya.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.205
ELECTRICITY

24:34.514 --> 24:35.849
Your friends all fell off.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.726
Are you...

24:39.144 --> 24:40.645
Are you the legendary 5-8?

24:41.396 --> 24:42.481
You're rude.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.524
You must wanna know who I am.

24:44.524 --> 24:46.860
I'm Sa-wol. Yoon Sa-wol.

24:46.860 --> 24:48.195
I don't want to know,

24:48.195 --> 24:49.613
and never asked.

24:49.613 --> 24:50.989
Shut your mouth and fight.

25:07.923 --> 25:09.174
What the heck?

25:09.174 --> 25:10.967
He's so freaking strong.

25:16.389 --> 25:18.141
Got no manners or fear.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.672
It's here.

25:49.297 --> 25:50.966
And it's a huge one.

27:13.632 --> 27:15.508
DISTRICT A

27:16.009 --> 27:18.261
It's even uglier than I remember.

27:20.597 --> 27:23.808
UNKNOWN SENDER
GATE 8, 5 P.M.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.021
Mission failed?

27:46.373 --> 27:47.749
The Air Core.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.543
It's sooner than I expected.

28:11.898 --> 28:14.192
Has the armed protest been
completely suppressed?

28:14.192 --> 28:17.112
Yes, the guard force
dealt with it. It's over.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.489
I should have called you earlier...

28:19.989 --> 28:22.200
Anyway, thank you
for coming all the way here.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.286
Since I have, I'd like to meet
the head of the guard force.

28:27.288 --> 28:30.542
Even you can't go in there
without authorization beforehand, Major.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.795
I understand secrecy is important,
but it's ridiculous to restrict access

28:33.795 --> 28:35.797
to a major
of the Defense Intelligence Command.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.882
I've told you time and time again,

28:38.341 --> 28:40.385
Cheonmyeong is leading
the construction of District A.

28:40.969 --> 28:44.013
Please don't take this the wrong way.
I ask for your understanding.

28:52.397 --> 28:53.606
Where are they going?

28:53.606 --> 28:55.608
They are Cheonmyeong's assets,

28:55.608 --> 28:59.404
and that being the case,
they're not of your purview either, Major.

29:10.290 --> 29:13.918
It's strange they're going this far
to stop people from seeing District A.

29:14.627 --> 29:17.046
Actually, yeah.
I was also wondering about that.

29:18.673 --> 29:21.468
That jackass head guard disappears
whenever I show up,

29:22.093 --> 29:24.888
and that Oh guy always brings up
Cheonmyeong, Cheonmyeong. God!

29:26.055 --> 29:27.474
The head guard's pretty old.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.976
I think calling him a jackass
is a little, um...

29:33.480 --> 29:34.564
Yeah, no, you're correct.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.609
Whoa!

29:39.819 --> 29:41.321
Oh shit.

29:41.946 --> 29:44.365
Hey, watch out, you damn idiot!

29:44.365 --> 29:45.784
Yes, sir, uh...

29:45.784 --> 29:47.327
I was trying to be careful.

29:56.085 --> 29:56.920
Stay alert!

30:08.890 --> 30:09.724
Open the door.

30:14.938 --> 30:16.689
Stop, hands in the air!

30:19.192 --> 30:20.318
What's going on?

30:21.778 --> 30:23.363
I hate having guns aimed at me.

30:23.363 --> 30:25.615
Major Jung Seol-ah,
Defense Intelligence Command.

30:25.615 --> 30:27.158
Is this your vehicle?

30:27.158 --> 30:28.743
The Cheonmyeong Group owns it.

30:28.743 --> 30:29.911
I know that.

30:30.411 --> 30:31.955
Please answer the question I asked.

30:34.249 --> 30:37.293
Yes, I drive this vehicle. Major.

30:37.877 --> 30:40.171
The area near District A
is off-limits.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.465
Why is your delivery vehicle
this far off-route?

30:42.465 --> 30:45.635
I got lost because of the tornado
and saw another path.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.220
Where did you go?

30:47.220 --> 30:48.763
Does that matter?

30:48.763 --> 30:50.390
I asked you where you went.

31:05.655 --> 31:06.489
I

31:07.198 --> 31:08.116
was

31:08.908 --> 31:09.742
uri...

31:10.493 --> 31:11.452
...nating.

31:12.036 --> 31:13.621
Let me check your ID.

31:23.798 --> 31:24.632
IDENTITY CONFIRMED

31:27.969 --> 31:29.721
Please leave right away.

31:44.277 --> 31:45.361
Get in the car.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.046
Little angry.

32:23.858 --> 32:24.692
I'm back.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.842
So did you have fun today?

32:51.302 --> 32:52.136
Huh?

32:53.763 --> 32:54.597
Mm-hmm.

32:55.348 --> 32:56.766
Go to your room, now.

32:56.766 --> 32:57.684
Now?

33:02.647 --> 33:04.273
What do we got here?

33:05.692 --> 33:07.568
Should be plenty, okay?

33:07.568 --> 33:08.945
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

inside for one day<i>.</i>

33:17.412 --> 33:19.580
-<i>What else can I do?</i>
- You serious? Um...

33:19.580 --> 33:21.124
Something went down today. Really.

33:21.124 --> 33:23.292
Just open the door.
I'll tell you everything.

33:23.292 --> 33:24.794
<i>Okay, then just say it.</i>

33:24.794 --> 33:26.838
<i>You can say everything just right here.</i>

33:26.838 --> 33:29.382
<i>How about we, uh,
eat something and chat?</i>

33:31.134 --> 33:34.012
Those boxes have enough food
to last 15 days.

33:34.012 --> 33:35.138
Ugh!

33:36.514 --> 33:39.392
<i>Okay look, I promise after tomorrow
I'll be inside every day.</i>

33:39.392 --> 33:42.145
<i>- I promise, I promise, okay?</i>
- You promise?

33:43.062 --> 33:44.939
'Cause I was thinking about it today.

33:45.648 --> 33:47.734
How many times
have you actually kept your word

33:47.734 --> 33:49.569
in the ten years you've lived here?

33:50.820 --> 33:51.654
How many? Uh...

33:52.321 --> 33:53.197
Not once.

33:53.781 --> 33:54.741
Zero times.

33:54.741 --> 33:55.658
Hey!

33:56.200 --> 33:57.952
That doesn't mean you can lock me in here.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.996
<i>Listen to Seol-ah and me
just this once.</i>

34:00.997 --> 34:02.623

35:15.279 --> 35:16.614
Are you on your own?

35:17.698 --> 35:18.533
No.

35:19.742 --> 35:20.743
My dad,

35:21.661 --> 35:23.454
he went to go get oxygen.

35:25.790 --> 35:26.833
Hmm.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.169
I GAVE MY ALL TO BECOME A DELIVERYMAN

35:30.169 --> 35:31.295
What's that book?

35:34.549 --> 35:35.550
It's mine.

35:36.175 --> 35:38.719
I'm gonna become a deliveryman.

35:40.888 --> 35:42.181
Oh, is that right?

35:42.181 --> 35:45.184
Yes, I really, really want to.

35:45.935 --> 35:47.645
I'll help the refugees,

35:48.896 --> 35:50.940
like 5-8 does,

35:50.940 --> 35:53.234
and give them oxygen and food.

35:53.818 --> 35:57.155
That way I'll become
the refugees beacon of hope,

35:58.406 --> 36:00.074
just like 5-8.

36:08.791 --> 36:09.959
Hey, old man.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.716
They suppressed
the armed protest at District A,

36:16.716 --> 36:19.177
so the mission
to delay the construction failed.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.220
Our informant is out of contact too.

36:22.221 --> 36:24.265
The idiot. Wonder if he died.

36:26.851 --> 36:28.436
The Air Core's in District A now.

36:29.770 --> 36:31.480
I'm gonna need you to go.

36:33.107 --> 36:33.941
Okay.

36:46.579 --> 36:48.497
PROCESSED FOOD

36:48.497 --> 36:50.499

36:50.499 --> 36:52.210
I'll be by again soon.

36:52.210 --> 36:53.628
Thank you so much.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.464
Just when we're about to die,
that's when you guys show up.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.384
I know I say this every time
but split it fairly.

37:00.384 --> 37:01.761
- Okay.
- Here.

37:13.564 --> 37:15.983
Heartbeat and blood pressure
are all normal.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.277
I'll come by again before the delivery.

37:18.277 --> 37:19.487
Thank you.

37:20.738 --> 37:21.572

<i>Why do you have to be gross?</i>

39:13.142 --> 39:14.643
It's the rebellion of youth.

You sound like a child,
not some kind of rebel.

No, he's busy, so I'm here today.

Are you the famous 5-8?

39:45.758 --> 39:48.260
- Yes.
- No way!

39:48.260 --> 39:49.261
Wow.

39:50.096 --> 39:51.430
Wow, that's totally...

39:51.430 --> 39:53.724
