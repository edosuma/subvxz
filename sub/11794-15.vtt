00:02.635 --> 00:04.237
( bell rings )

00:04.270 --> 00:06.806
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:09.943
   <i>* I don't think</i>
   <i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.976 --> 00:12.612
 <i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
 <i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.645 --> 00:16.483
 <i>* I'm at the corner</i>
 <i>just in time</i>
 <i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.516 --> 00:21.988
  <i>* It's all right</i>
  <i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:22.022 --> 00:25.025
  <i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
  <i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:25.058 --> 00:27.660
   <i>* And my dog ate</i>
   <i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.694 --> 00:31.031

00:34.701 --> 00:39.039
 <i>* It's all right</i>

00:52.852 --> 00:55.789

<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:15.075 --> 01:17.577
 Zack:
 <i>I'll never forget the day</i>
 <i>Slater showed up.</i>

01:17.610 --> 01:20.246
   ( phone ringing )

01:24.651 --> 01:28.955
 <i>Good morning, Zack.</i>
 <i>This is Cindy,</i>
 <i>your wake-up caller.</i>

01:28.988 --> 01:33.093
 <i>It's 7:00, tiger.</i>
 <i>Time to roar.</i>

01:35.862 --> 01:39.232
 It's the first day of school,
 and I can't wait to get there.

01:39.265 --> 01:40.700
 Why?

01:46.272 --> 01:47.974
Kelly Kapowski.

01:48.008 --> 01:51.511
 Loves volleyball, windsurfing,
 and soon, me.

01:51.544 --> 01:54.180
 This is the year
 that I make my move.

01:56.816 --> 02:00.620
   Do you mind?
   Mingle among yourselves.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.592
How do I look?

02:18.605 --> 02:21.074
 I'm so jazzed.
 I got all the best teachers.

02:21.107 --> 02:25.078
 The best teachers
 are the ones who call in sick.

02:25.078 --> 02:26.980
   - How's your schedule?
   - It's the worst.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.115
 I only have one lunch period.

02:29.149 --> 02:32.085
  Zack, this may come
  as a shock to you,

02:32.085 --> 02:35.088
 but education is more than
 just French
 fries and tuna melts.

02:35.121 --> 02:38.224
   That's right, Jessie.
   You forgot cheeseburgers.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.260
 Belding: Welcome back, Tracy.

02:40.293 --> 02:43.163
  - Hi, Mr. Belding.
  - Great to see you, Jessie.

02:43.196 --> 02:47.100
 Morris.
 The thorn in my paw.

02:47.100 --> 02:49.703
Mr. Belding, sir.
You look great.

02:49.736 --> 02:50.970
  Oh, really?

02:51.004 --> 02:55.608
You've lost at least
10 pounds. You must have
been working out.

02:55.642 --> 02:58.111
Mrs. B and I did take up
synchronized swimming.

02:59.713 --> 03:03.717
You haven't seen <i>Dirty Dancing</i>
till you've
seen us underwater.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.920
  I can't wait, sir.

03:06.953 --> 03:09.489
 And you'll probably
 be a better principal for it.

03:09.522 --> 03:10.757
   Thank you, Zack.

03:10.790 --> 03:13.526
And may I add that you have
not lost your
ability to suck up?

03:13.560 --> 03:15.061
Thank you, sir.

03:18.098 --> 03:21.501
   This is a disaster.
   My entire year has
just been ruined.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.170
 What, did Revlon
 discontinue your lipstick,
 Lisa?

03:24.204 --> 03:26.239
That's not funny, Zack.

03:26.272 --> 03:28.775
 They gave me a locker
 surrounded by nerds.

03:30.677 --> 03:32.879
 Zack, you've got to get me
 another locker.

03:32.912 --> 03:34.481
I'll owe you a big one.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.083
 Define "big."

03:37.117 --> 03:39.252
 I'll do your Spanish
 homework for a week.

03:39.285 --> 03:43.523
- You're on.
I'll see what I can do.
- Thanks, Zack.

03:43.556 --> 03:46.092
  Lockers.
  The key to my plan.

03:46.092 --> 03:47.994
 Kelly was
 assigned this locker,

03:48.094 --> 03:52.232
 which means the one next to it
 will soon be mine.

03:52.265 --> 03:54.567
   Hi, you're new here.
   I'm Zack Morris.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.836
  And I'm Roger Rabbit,
  so what?

03:56.870 --> 03:59.839
   - Come on, what's your name?
   - Slater.

03:59.873 --> 04:03.476
 Well, Slater, too bad
 you got stuck
 with the bum locker.

04:03.510 --> 04:05.745
  Hey, why don't you take mine?
  It's next to
  the girls' bathroom.

04:05.779 --> 04:08.948
  Unless it's in
  the girls' bathroom,
  forget it.

04:09.049 --> 04:12.085
You don't understand,
I'm letting you
have my locker.

04:12.118 --> 04:13.586
   Hi, Zack.

04:14.754 --> 04:15.855
  No thanks.

04:18.257 --> 04:21.795
 - I'm Kelly, who are you?
 - Whoever you want me to be.

04:21.827 --> 04:25.699
  He's funny.
  See you guys later.

04:25.732 --> 04:29.669
   - Does she always
   smell that good?
   - Kelly Kapowski?

04:29.703 --> 04:31.237
You don't want anything
to do with her.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.674
  - Why not?
  - She's...

04:34.708 --> 04:37.177
   she has leprosy.

04:37.210 --> 04:39.479
 Hey, we all have
 skin problems, right?

04:40.680 --> 04:43.083
   Okay, okay. Look, look...

04:43.083 --> 04:46.486
  give me your locker,
  I'll give you
  a genuine hall pass

04:46.519 --> 04:48.888
  with
  the principal's signature.

04:48.922 --> 04:52.125
 That ain't Belding's
 signature. ( scoffs )

04:52.158 --> 04:54.194
 This is Belding's signature.

04:56.830 --> 04:59.799
   This is Belding's signature.
   How'd you get this?

04:59.833 --> 05:03.703
   Look kid,
   I've been in 14 schools
   in the last three years.

05:03.737 --> 05:05.739
  I've got hall passes
  in five languages.

05:05.772 --> 05:09.142
- Awesome.
- <i>Bonjour,</i> pal.

05:09.175 --> 05:11.211
   I don't like him already.

05:13.580 --> 05:16.182
 Hey, there he is,
 my main man.

05:19.252 --> 05:20.787
 I'm talking to you, Screech.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.056
Oh, wow!
Thanks.

05:23.056 --> 05:26.126
 Screech, buddy,
 if you could share your locker

05:26.159 --> 05:29.129
   with anybody in
   this whole school,
   who would it be?

05:29.162 --> 05:32.799
- You, Zack, of course.
- Great,
because I'm moving in.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.869
Wow!
You and me, roommates.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.737
   Thanks for letting me
   share my locker.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.073
 Hey, we're buddies, aren't we?

05:42.208 --> 05:46.079
   Say,
   buddy, do you mind putting
   your books on the bottom?

05:46.079 --> 05:48.081
 There's some kind
 of jelly down there.

05:48.081 --> 05:49.949
  We can't have that.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.219
   Let me tidy up our place.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.957
  ( vacuum whirring )

06:06.666 --> 06:08.034
  After your locker,

06:08.034 --> 06:10.103
  the most important thing
  is where you sit in class.

06:10.136 --> 06:12.939
 That's why I've got to sit
 next to Kelly.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.475
 Lucky for me,
 Jessie is sitting there now.

06:15.508 --> 06:17.444
 We're like brother and sister.

06:17.477 --> 06:20.080
- No way, Zack.
- Jessie!
You're my best friend.

06:20.113 --> 06:21.247
   How can you turn me down?

06:21.281 --> 06:24.551
 Because I don't want to sit
 in the back. I want to learn.

06:24.584 --> 06:28.855
 So do l.
 This year I want to study.
 Honest.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.491
All you want to
study is Kelly...
honest.

06:31.524 --> 06:35.729
( scoffs ) Are you kidding?
That bow-wow?

06:35.762 --> 06:38.498
 Come on, everyone knows
 you've got the hots for her.

06:39.966 --> 06:41.901
  They do now, thanks to you.

06:44.804 --> 06:46.740
   Look, can I have
   your seat or not?

06:46.773 --> 06:49.576
Sorry. Find yourself
another pigeon.

06:51.111 --> 06:52.145
   Oh, Lisa?

06:54.147 --> 06:55.915
   Can I talk to
   you for a second?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.183
 Sure.

06:59.652 --> 07:02.489
  - I got you a new locker.
  - Zack, you're incredible.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.024
  - Where is it?
  - It's 118.

07:04.024 --> 07:06.659
  118!
  Right by the boys bathroom

07:06.693 --> 07:09.062
 where every guy
 will walk by me
 at least once a day?

07:09.095 --> 07:11.664
- Sometimes twice.
- I owe you one, Zack.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.667
  I'll do your Spanish homework
  for three weeks.

07:13.700 --> 07:17.470
 Tell you what, you give me
 your desk and
 we'll call it even.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.639
- It's yours.
- Thanks, Lisa.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.078
 - Hi, Zack.
 - Hi, Kelly.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.079
Lisa asked me to switch

07:26.112 --> 07:29.549
so I guess we'll be sitting
next to each other.

07:31.718 --> 07:33.687
  I saved you a seat.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.588
 I'm touched.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.869
  ( whining monotone )
  Okay, people, settle down.

07:49.903 --> 07:52.672
 I'm Mr. Dewey...
 how was everyone's summer...

07:52.706 --> 07:54.941
  mine stunk...
  let's get started.

07:57.243 --> 08:00.013
  We're about to embark
  on an exhilarating journey

08:00.046 --> 08:02.515
   into the exciting
   world of algebra.

08:04.884 --> 08:07.854
 I'll wait till your hearts
 stop pounding.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.858
  Yes, you there in the back.

08:11.891 --> 08:16.096
 Mr. Dewey, sir, well,
 this is a little embarrassing,

08:16.129 --> 08:19.766
   I'm legally blind in one eye
   and I really got
   to sit up close.

08:19.799 --> 08:23.203
 By all means, young man.
 l can relate to that.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.205
   That's why I am up here.

08:27.741 --> 08:30.043
   - Any volunteers?
   - Sure, he can have mine.

08:30.076 --> 08:33.546
 No! Not you.
 I mean, that's not necessary.

08:33.580 --> 08:36.049
   I take it then,
   that you're volunteering?

08:36.049 --> 08:37.951
Me? ( scoffs )

08:38.051 --> 08:40.553
  First he offers me his locker
  and now his seat.

08:40.587 --> 08:43.155
   I'm telling you,
he's a regular
   "Brother Teresa."

08:51.264 --> 08:55.201
  Great, Zack, you and me
  sitting together all year!

08:59.072 --> 09:01.741
 Oh! About sharing lockers...
 I can't, for health reasons.

09:01.775 --> 09:04.110
   What do you mean,
   "health reasons"?

09:04.144 --> 09:06.413
   Slater said he'd kill me.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.692
 Both.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.727
   This beats eating
   in the school cafeteria.

09:20.760 --> 09:24.864
   It's nice to see a hamburger
   you don't have to comb.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.634
Okay.
Lunch is here.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.737
 Burgers, fries, and perhaps...

09:30.770 --> 09:32.172
  a surprise.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.607
  - Max, how'd you do that?
  - Easy.

09:34.641 --> 09:37.677
   My rabbit handed them to me.
   Boing!

09:43.049 --> 09:45.218
  I see your future squeeze.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.288
  - Have you asked her out yet?
  - Technically, not yet.

09:48.321 --> 09:51.091
   But in my mind,
   we already have children.

09:53.226 --> 09:56.062
   Could you take
   this Coke over to Kelly?

09:56.062 --> 09:58.098
   I'm a little shorthanded.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.067
   - Sure.
   - Thanks.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.638
  - Hi.
  - Hi, Zack.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.774
  Max asked me
  to bring your Coke.

10:07.807 --> 10:09.042
Thanks,
but I didn't order one.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.811
 ( mouthing )

10:15.115 --> 10:18.084
   - Kelly,
   can I ask you something?
   - Sure, go ahead.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.652
Well...

10:21.721 --> 10:23.790
- how was your summer?
- It was great.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.859
 My parents sent me
 to volleyball camp in Florida.

10:25.892 --> 10:28.862
   - We played on
   the beach every day.
   - It must have been hot.

10:28.895 --> 10:30.830
 It wasn't the heat,
 it was the humidity.

10:30.864 --> 10:34.801
 You wouldn't believe how
 your T-shirt
 clings to your body.

10:34.834 --> 10:37.404
   "Clings"? "Body"?

10:37.437 --> 10:38.938
  Do you mind if I have
  some of that Coke?

10:38.972 --> 10:42.942
 Go ahead. What was it
 you wanted to ask me?

10:42.976 --> 10:44.944
  - Do you think
  you might like to...
  - Yes... ?

10:44.978 --> 10:47.247
 So, what's happening?
 You guys want an onion ring?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.715
 Sure.

10:51.484 --> 10:54.387
   - I think we're engaged.
   - I think I'm gonna cry.

10:56.122 --> 10:57.857
 That makes two of us.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.799
 Hey, I'm not really a bad guy.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.767
 So,
 please forgive me in advance,

11:07.801 --> 11:11.304
but what you are about
to witness is the act of
a very desperate man.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.972
( bell rings )

11:14.240 --> 11:15.408
 ( coughing )

11:15.442 --> 11:17.911
Screech, what's wrong?

11:17.944 --> 11:19.713
   Are you all right?
   You don't sound so good.

11:19.746 --> 11:23.383
 Yeah, my cat made those noises
 before he coughed up a mouse.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.788
 Bone.

11:28.822 --> 11:32.092
   Oh, no! He swallowed a bone.
   Somebody quick, help!

11:32.092 --> 11:34.327
  Here, I can handle this.
  I was a lifeguard.

11:34.361 --> 11:36.229
 I knew that.

11:36.262 --> 11:38.264
   Screech, don't panic.
   I'm gonna put my
   arms around you,

11:38.298 --> 11:41.401
 and try to force that bone
 out of your throat.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.772
 - How did that feel?
 - More, more.

11:45.805 --> 11:47.807
 - Screech!
 - ( grunts )

11:47.841 --> 11:49.309
 Did I get it?

11:49.342 --> 11:51.678
 It was wonderful.
 Was it good for you?

11:54.114 --> 11:57.384
  I got it.
  The bone flew out.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.352
 What'd you have for lunch,
 a coyote?

12:00.487 --> 12:02.389
Hey, great work, Kelly.

12:02.422 --> 12:04.224
 Thanks, but now
 I'm gonna be late for class.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.659
 Mr. Minavich is gonna kill me.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.731
   - How'd I do, Zack?
   - You did great. Perfect.

12:11.765 --> 12:14.734
 Go save me
 a seat in study hall.
 I'll be right there, thanks.

12:14.768 --> 12:17.337
  Teacher: <i>Miss Kapowski,</i>
  <i>you've been with me before,</i>
  <i>you know the rules.</i>

12:17.370 --> 12:20.840
<i>If you're not in your seat</i>
<i>when the bell rings,</i>
<i>it's detention.</i>

12:22.876 --> 12:24.310
 What a shame.

12:24.344 --> 12:26.913
   Poor Kelly will be sitting
   all alone after school...

12:26.946 --> 12:30.750
 unless someone
 can get in detention
 to keep her company.

12:30.784 --> 12:33.086
( bell rings )

12:37.290 --> 12:40.727
  We'll begin as soon
  as the bell rings.

12:46.433 --> 12:50.170
  It's the first day.
  They must have
  forgotten the bell.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.407
  ( loudly )
  We'll start anyway.

12:56.109 --> 13:01.047
Now, "To be or not to be,
that is the question."

13:01.047 --> 13:04.250
- Who said that?
- You just did, ma'am.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.920
 Right, it was Hamlet.

13:06.953 --> 13:10.290
 But who was the author
 of <i>Hamlet?</i>

13:10.323 --> 13:12.959
- Anyone?
- William Shakespeare.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.262
 No one knows?

13:18.098 --> 13:22.135
Then I'll have to tell you.
William Shakespeare.

13:22.168 --> 13:24.304
  No kidding.

13:24.337 --> 13:28.641
 No, no, not Kipling,
 Shakespeare.

13:28.675 --> 13:31.945
 - Zack, you'll get in trouble.
 - I'm trying, I'm trying.

13:31.978 --> 13:34.214
  Excuse me?
  You there.

13:34.247 --> 13:37.951
 - Yes.
 - No, not you.
 The girl behind you.

13:37.984 --> 13:42.222
 Any more
 whispering and I shall
 have to send you to detention.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.890
- Me?
- Her?

13:43.923 --> 13:45.225
 What?

13:47.694 --> 13:51.131
   This term we
   are going to cover
   <i>Macbeth,</i>

13:51.164 --> 13:54.668
   <i>The Merchant of Venice,</i>
   <i>Romeo and Juliet,</i>

13:54.701 --> 13:57.003
and of course, <i>Macbeth.</i>

14:00.040 --> 14:02.242
Which shall we choose
to start with?

14:02.275 --> 14:05.078
 How about <i>McMuffin</i>
 and <i>McNugget?</i>

14:06.046 --> 14:07.814
  Both good choices.

14:10.283 --> 14:15.055
 Now does anyone
 know how Romeo died?

14:15.055 --> 14:18.058
  Yes.
  He took your class.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.359
Right.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.929
  Poison in a glass.

14:22.962 --> 14:25.231
   - What?
   - ( book thumps )

14:25.932 --> 14:27.400
  Young man,

14:27.434 --> 14:31.805
 you have just
 dropped the works
 of Shakespeare on the floor.

14:31.838 --> 14:36.843
  That lack of respect will not
  be tolerated in my class.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.112
 Get thee to Belding.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.950
   Yes, Miss Simpson.
   I goeth.

14:48.088 --> 14:49.956
I don't like that boy.

14:55.495 --> 15:00.033
 The principal's office.
 It's been like
 a second home to me.

15:00.033 --> 15:04.170
 Look around.
 Everything's in perfect order.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.373
 Mr.
 Belding's a real neat freak.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.108
  Watch this.

15:16.149 --> 15:18.518
  It's the first day of school,
  and you're in detention.

15:18.551 --> 15:22.122
  What is it this time, Morris?
  Aliens take over
  your body again?

15:22.155 --> 15:24.958
   No, sir.
   They flew home
   for the holidays.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.262
  - You moved that, didn't you?
  - I'm sorry, sir.

15:29.295 --> 15:31.064
Please don't
touch my things.

15:31.064 --> 15:32.399
I guess
I couldn't help myself.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.967
That's not good enough,
Morris.

15:34.067 --> 15:36.936
   You have a complete lack
   of self-control.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.538
I can't fool you, sir.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.974
  Question is, what are we
  gonna do about it?

15:41.074 --> 15:44.310
- I guess I'm
looking at detention.
- Guess again.

15:44.344 --> 15:47.313
   I'm taking a different
   approach with you, Zack.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.116
  You're gonna be Mr. Rogers?

15:52.118 --> 15:54.220
  You're in the neighborhood.

15:55.321 --> 15:57.624
 Have a seat.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.426
 This year,
 besides being your principal,

15:59.459 --> 16:02.228
  I'm also going to try to give
  the students guidance.

16:02.262 --> 16:05.031
  And you are the first lad
  I'm going to guide.

16:05.031 --> 16:08.301
I want to help you,
understand you.

16:08.335 --> 16:11.938
What's to understand?
I'm bad. A rotten kid!

16:12.038 --> 16:13.673
  ( mumbles )

16:13.707 --> 16:18.044
 There are no bad boys.
 Only boys that
 haven't been reached.

16:18.044 --> 16:21.548
   Mr. Belding, you got to
   send the right message to
   the student body.

16:21.581 --> 16:23.416
 I deserve detention.

16:24.718 --> 16:26.453
   You may not realize this,

16:26.486 --> 16:29.923
 but deep down might you
 be seeking detention?

16:32.058 --> 16:33.493
  What makes you think that?

16:33.526 --> 16:36.262
 I don't question the gift,
 I just go with it.

16:37.597 --> 16:40.233
Sir, look
I really need detention.

16:40.266 --> 16:42.068
 I'll determine
 what you need.

16:42.068 --> 16:43.937
  ( tapping )

16:43.970 --> 16:46.206
 Would you
 please put that back?

16:46.239 --> 16:49.209
   - You mean this bothers you?
   - Yes it does.

16:51.511 --> 16:54.481
Then I'll put it
back right now.

16:54.514 --> 16:58.485
 - Oh! I'm sorry.
 - Please, I'll put those back.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.420
 I know where they go.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.292
  You know, Zack,
  this summer I
  attended a seminar

17:07.327 --> 17:10.195
 on how to handle
 "the problem child."

17:10.230 --> 17:13.266
Above all,
you must have patience.

17:13.299 --> 17:16.670
  Don't touch my
  "Principal of
  the Month" trophy.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.204
 - You mean this?
 - Yes, that.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.041
 Where was l?

17:22.041 --> 17:24.411
  You were talking about having
  patience with
  "the problem child."

17:25.111 --> 17:26.212
 Right, right.

17:26.246 --> 17:30.250
Zack,
we must try and understand
each other's position.

17:30.283 --> 17:33.186
 Now what they say
 is that you kids have a need

17:33.219 --> 17:36.623
and we have to
figure out exactly...
put Mrs. Belding down.

17:39.325 --> 17:43.096
I am positive that together
we can work out...

17:45.198 --> 17:47.233
Look what you've done!

17:47.267 --> 17:50.170
   Okay, mister,
   you've pushed me too far.

17:50.203 --> 17:52.539
   I hope you'll be
   very happy in detention.

17:52.572 --> 17:55.175
 I'll try to make
 the best of it, sir.

18:02.182 --> 18:05.085
  Detention.
  Just Kelly and me.

18:05.118 --> 18:07.020
  A dream come true.

18:15.595 --> 18:19.065
  Hello, Zack.
  I've been waiting for you.

18:31.044 --> 18:35.281
   It was so clever of you
   to arrange for us to be in
   detention together.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.317
   I hope I've pleased you.

18:38.952 --> 18:40.420
   What does that tell you?

18:43.056 --> 18:44.958
   Oh, boy.

18:45.058 --> 18:47.227
 Please, make yourself
 comfortable.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.562
   - Oh, no, after you.
   - No, no.

18:49.596 --> 18:52.499
You must be tired
from all that scheming.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.300
Rest, my love.

18:55.402 --> 18:58.204
   I was cunning, wasn't I?

18:58.238 --> 19:02.042
  Yes, your mind turns me on.

19:02.075 --> 19:03.410
  I love you, master.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.651
  Why keep my love
  waiting any longer?

19:19.492 --> 19:20.794
   What are you doing here?

19:20.827 --> 19:24.164
 Well, I liked your act
 so much, I decided to
 pull one of my own.

19:24.197 --> 19:25.632
What'd you do?

19:25.665 --> 19:28.368
 You know Mr. Warren,
 the science teacher?

19:28.401 --> 19:30.036
 I mooned him.

19:32.072 --> 19:34.541
No kidding.
I'm impressed.

19:34.574 --> 19:37.310
 Doesn't matter.
 We're both a couple of jerks.

19:37.344 --> 19:40.647
 - ( scoffs ) What do you mean?
 - Kelly's not coming.

19:43.116 --> 19:47.253
Belding found out she saved
Screech's life
and he excused her.

19:47.287 --> 19:50.256
  So after all this,
  it's... you and me?

19:51.358 --> 19:53.460
   Ain't love grand?

19:54.527 --> 19:56.062
  None of this
  would have happened

19:56.096 --> 19:57.697
if you hadn't tried
to move in on my girl.

19:57.731 --> 20:01.067
 Your girl? I didn't see a sign
 on her saying, "Zack's chick."

20:01.101 --> 20:03.970
  Slater, I've waited for Kelly
  for two years.

20:04.004 --> 20:06.072
   I've lived through
   her last six boyfriends.

20:06.106 --> 20:07.574
 Think of the man-hours
 I've put in.

20:07.607 --> 20:09.609
  ( scoffs )
  Wimp-hours is more like it.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.045
   ( scoffs ) You're
   calling me names?

20:12.078 --> 20:15.048
 You're the one who's been
 in 14 schools in three years.

20:15.081 --> 20:17.050
   What are you,
   some sort of delinquent?

20:17.083 --> 20:21.154
 Hey, look, "Preppie,"
 my father's in the Army, okay?

20:21.187 --> 20:23.189
While he's trying to be
all he can be,

20:23.223 --> 20:24.724
 I get shipped
 along with his boots.

20:24.758 --> 20:27.060
 - You got a problem with that?
 - What if I do?

20:27.093 --> 20:29.729
 Pushing, shoving, menacing,
 and roughhousing of any kind

20:29.763 --> 20:33.533
   are prohibited
   on school grounds
   and/or buildings.

20:33.566 --> 20:35.435
  That's what
  your homes are for.

20:36.636 --> 20:38.204
  We weren't arguing.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.607
   We were just discussing
   a math problem...

20:40.640 --> 20:42.709
  how two into one won't go.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.245
   I don't' believe it
   and I don't care.

20:45.278 --> 20:49.349
 I'm tired, I have a toothache,
 and I have to go
 home and pump iron.

20:52.652 --> 20:55.088
  Hey, is your dad
  really in the Army?

20:55.121 --> 20:59.092
  lf he's not, this is a really
  dirty trick he's
  been playing on us.

20:59.125 --> 21:01.761
What's it like going
from school to school?

21:01.795 --> 21:04.397
   It's not so bad.

21:04.431 --> 21:07.634
   Slater,
   if you and I joined forces,
   we could own this school.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.704
- Sorry, kid, I work alone.
- Who's asking?

21:10.737 --> 21:15.141
 You were.
 I scare you, don't I, Morris?

21:15.175 --> 21:17.410
  This was your turf
  until I showed up.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.546
It was, it is,
and it always will be.

21:19.579 --> 21:22.082
You want to make
a friendly bet on that?

21:22.082 --> 21:24.117
  Count on it, buddy.

21:33.093 --> 21:36.129
 All right, maybe the first day
 didn't turn out as I planned.

21:36.162 --> 21:38.365
 But hey, I'm just warming up.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.100
   I love school...

21:40.100 --> 21:42.335
too bad classes
get in the way.

21:46.439 --> 21:49.275
 ( instrumental music plays )
