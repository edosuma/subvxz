01:30.883 --> 01:33.344
INTERVIEWER: Do you feel
like the U.S. government

01:33.427 --> 01:37.681
has told you
the full truth about what
really happened and why?

01:37.765 --> 01:42.937
I don't think they've
told anybody the whole truth.

01:43.020 --> 01:48.859
The whole truth lies with
the people that were there.

01:48.943 --> 01:50.861
They hold the truth.

02:10.798 --> 02:14.218
NARRATOR:
The killing of
Kiki Camarena in 1985

02:14.301 --> 02:16.929
sent shockwaves
through the DEA.

02:17.012 --> 02:21.684
In the immediate aftermath,
the agency launched its own
investigation into the murder.

02:21.767 --> 02:24.186
It was called
Operation Leyenda.

02:24.270 --> 02:27.398
Prior to his death,
Kiki's investigations

02:27.481 --> 02:31.277
had cost the Guadalajara cartel
hundreds of millions of dollars.

02:31.360 --> 02:35.114
The cartel's role in Kiki's
murder was an open secret.

02:35.197 --> 02:38.826
But the DEA suspected that
high ranking Mexican officials

02:38.909 --> 02:40.953
were also involved.

02:41.036 --> 02:44.206
However, four years after
Operation Leyenda began,

02:44.290 --> 02:48.502
the DEA still had no
eye witnesses with
firsthand knowledge

02:48.586 --> 02:51.463
of Kiki's abduction,
torture, and murder.

02:51.547 --> 02:55.259
That changed when
Hector Berrellez
took over the investigation

02:55.342 --> 02:58.512
and began using his vast network
of Mexican informants

02:58.596 --> 03:03.142
to uncover the truth
about what happened
to Kiki in Guadalajara.

03:22.077 --> 03:24.079
BERRELLEZ:
Shortly after being assigned

03:24.163 --> 03:26.790
as head of the Camarena
murder investigation,

03:26.874 --> 03:29.835
my main focus and mission was:

03:29.919 --> 03:34.798
find out who was there
that could tell me

03:34.882 --> 03:36.258
everything that happened
to Kiki.

03:48.437 --> 03:50.564
MIKA: The last time that
I saw Kiki

03:50.648 --> 03:53.651
was when he left to work
that morning.

03:53.734 --> 03:57.237
We were laughing
because he had a new truck

03:57.321 --> 04:00.199
and he wanted to put the--

04:00.282 --> 04:03.619
the gray on the windows,
the protector.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.330
And I said, "Just have
somebody do it professionally

04:06.413 --> 04:08.165
and it'll look nice."

04:08.248 --> 04:10.709
"Oh, no, no, no, no,
I can do it, I'll do it,
I'll do it."

04:10.793 --> 04:14.588
When I went out that morning,
the whole back window
was bubbled.

04:14.672 --> 04:19.093
And I was--
I was making fun of him.

04:19.176 --> 04:22.137
So, it was--
it was a cheerful morning,

04:22.221 --> 04:23.389
it was a happy morning.

04:25.099 --> 04:27.434
He calls me about noon
and he says,

04:27.518 --> 04:31.522
"Hey, you want to go to
our favorite restaurant
to have lunch?"

04:31.605 --> 04:33.732
And I said, "Yes, well,
what time? What time?"

04:33.816 --> 04:35.818
I would never say no.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.736
I don't care what time it was,

04:37.820 --> 04:41.073
I don't care if I had
already had the table

04:41.156 --> 04:43.659
set up for dinner,
I would never say no.

04:47.579 --> 04:50.165
LIRA:
At dawn on February 7th,

04:50.249 --> 04:52.126
the day of the kidnapping.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.961
That day in the morning,

04:54.044 --> 04:57.172
Fonseca told me,
"Stay with me,

04:57.256 --> 05:00.551
because we are
going to do a job."

05:00.634 --> 05:05.514
LOPEZ:
Rene Verdugo arrived
and told Ernesto Fonseca,

05:05.597 --> 05:08.642
"Sir,

05:08.726 --> 05:11.770
"the person

05:11.854 --> 05:13.605
"will come out at noon,

05:13.689 --> 05:15.774
and we have to be there
before then."

05:19.153 --> 05:21.947
I was in Samuel's group.

05:24.908 --> 05:29.705
Ernesto Fonseca went
with Ramon Lira in one group.

05:29.788 --> 05:32.374
Caro Quintero
was with another.

05:32.458 --> 05:35.586
BERRELLEZ:
Six, seven cars,

05:35.669 --> 05:39.423
four to five men in each car
all carrying AK-47s.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.633
He's very well armed.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.560
LIRA:
We arrived there
and we parked

05:54.104 --> 05:56.106
at the intersection of

05:56.190 --> 05:58.984
Prisciliano Sanchez
and Lopez Cotilla,

05:59.068 --> 06:04.364
one or two blocks away
from the U.S. consulate.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.494
LOPEZ:
When Kiki comes out of
the consulate,

06:08.577 --> 06:12.372
Rene Verdugo says,
"That's him."

06:12.456 --> 06:17.211
When Kiki was in
the middle of the street,

06:17.294 --> 06:20.005
Samuel gets out of the car
and tells me, "Come on."

06:22.007 --> 06:23.592
When Kiki gets on
the sidewalk,

06:23.675 --> 06:25.886
as soon as he got on
the sidewalk, Samuel told him...

06:25.969 --> 06:27.846
"DFS," shows him
his credentials.

06:27.930 --> 06:30.641
"The comandante
wants to talk to you."

06:30.724 --> 06:33.727
Kiki very calmly turns around
and he says, "Esta bien,

06:33.811 --> 06:37.523
that's okay, let me notify
my office via radio,"

06:37.606 --> 06:41.110
and he reaches for his
walkie-talkie in his DEA truck,

06:41.193 --> 06:43.904
and that's when Sammy
pulled a gun on him, "No."

06:43.987 --> 06:45.614
Samuel told him,

06:45.697 --> 06:48.659
"Don't resist, or I'll
finish you right here."

06:50.661 --> 06:52.079
"Alright," Kiki said.

06:52.162 --> 06:55.833
I thought he was going to
react differently.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.672
Samuel said, "Let's walk."

07:01.755 --> 07:04.967
And Kiki walked, he was calm.

07:05.050 --> 07:08.637
We put him in the back seat.

07:08.720 --> 07:12.516
In between us.

07:13.851 --> 07:16.436
Samuel said, "Lean him over,

07:16.520 --> 07:18.313
and put a jacket
over his head."

07:19.815 --> 07:22.276
So we leaned him over
and put a jacket on him.

07:24.278 --> 07:27.489
Well, when we started
driving away,

07:27.573 --> 07:29.825
Samuel spoke on the radio.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.286
"We are taking the package
to the office."

07:32.369 --> 07:35.122
Those were the words he used.

07:37.875 --> 07:41.044
BERRELLEZ:
He says then we drove him to
the Lope de Vega house

07:41.128 --> 07:42.921
where Caro Quintero was,

07:43.005 --> 07:46.258
and all the military guys
and other DFS bosses were.

07:59.229 --> 08:03.275
MIKA: I go meet him
at the restaurant

08:03.358 --> 08:07.112
and he's not there,
which is fine because,

08:07.196 --> 08:09.740
you know, they- they--
it was a known fact

08:09.823 --> 08:11.825
they get delayed
for one reason or another,

08:11.909 --> 08:14.703
whatever's happening
at the office.

08:14.786 --> 08:17.122
But this time,
it was too long.

08:19.917 --> 08:23.503
I was hungry,
so I decided to eat.

08:23.587 --> 08:25.797
And I thought, I bet you
he was called back to work

08:25.881 --> 08:28.467
and that's why
he didn't show up.

08:35.098 --> 08:38.268
LOPEZ:
And the celebration began.

08:38.352 --> 08:40.479
When we all got out of
the cars and everything,

08:40.562 --> 08:42.064
they began to embrace.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.399
And they were excited,
you know?

08:44.483 --> 08:46.235
So they celebrated.

08:47.694 --> 08:51.490
And Samuel gave orders,
"Bring some bandages

08:51.573 --> 08:53.033
from the kitchen."

08:53.116 --> 08:56.119
Torres Lepe bandaged Kiki.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.371
He covered his eyes.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.665
And we got him out of the car,

08:59.748 --> 09:03.126
and we brought him to--
to the room that--

09:03.210 --> 09:07.464
that they have for servants.
It was a big house.

09:15.138 --> 09:17.140
INTERVIEWER:
And where was he?

09:17.224 --> 09:18.850
Show me the room.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.435
I want to know exactly
the layout of the room.

09:20.519 --> 09:24.022
The room more or less
was like this one.

09:24.106 --> 09:27.776
The pool was
right next to it.

09:29.027 --> 09:31.989
You go in and
here was the bed.

09:32.072 --> 09:35.742
A window there
and a bathroom here.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.831
When we got there,
Fonseca went directly

09:40.914 --> 09:44.418
to the room where
they had Camarena.

09:44.501 --> 09:46.795
And at that moment,

09:46.878 --> 09:50.173
I saw Camarena there,
blindfolded.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.802
Then I started noticing
all the politicians...

09:53.885 --> 09:58.223
It was kind of like a party.

09:58.307 --> 10:00.225
I think there were about...

10:00.309 --> 10:03.854
50, 60 people in the house.

10:03.937 --> 10:09.484
Government officials,
politicians, narcos...

10:09.568 --> 10:12.237
the cream of the crop.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.409
LIRA:
It's no birthday party.

10:17.492 --> 10:19.703
It's a macabre party,

10:19.786 --> 10:23.999
because a few steps away,
someone is being tortured.

10:39.639 --> 10:43.226
"And who told you about
the Bufalo plantation?"

10:45.228 --> 10:47.773
Kiki told him, "No, wait,"
he says.

10:47.856 --> 10:52.319
"I know I'm here
because of Caro Quintero.

10:52.402 --> 10:55.280
"I would like to talk to him.

10:55.364 --> 10:58.575
I'm of more use to Caro

10:58.658 --> 11:00.452
alive than dead."

11:03.955 --> 11:05.832
The first interrogator leaves,

11:05.916 --> 11:07.459
and Caro Quintero enters.

11:08.919 --> 11:11.088
When Caro Quintero enters,

11:11.171 --> 11:13.465
he grabs Kiki by the hair,

11:13.548 --> 11:16.343
and he throws him
to the ground.

11:16.426 --> 11:19.304
He told him, "Look,
you son a fucking bitch!

11:19.388 --> 11:21.973
"I sent you money, fucker.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.351
Yet you raided and
destroyed my plantation."

11:26.144 --> 11:29.439
"We were just doing
our job," Kiki answered.

11:29.523 --> 11:33.485
"Son of a bitch,
you took our money!

11:33.568 --> 11:36.822
We sent you money."

11:36.905 --> 11:40.992
"No," Kiki said,
"You're wrong.

11:41.076 --> 11:44.121
I've never taken
any money from you."

11:47.916 --> 11:50.168
"Now I want you to tell me,

11:50.252 --> 11:53.422
"who do you know
of the politicians

11:53.505 --> 11:55.966
who are involved in
drug trafficking?"

11:58.343 --> 12:00.095
Kiki said,
"No, you know what?

12:00.178 --> 12:03.807
"I don't know which politicians
you're talking about.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.725
"I don't know any
politicians that -

12:05.809 --> 12:08.603
are involved in
drug trafficking."

12:08.687 --> 12:11.690
"Don't play stupid,
you son of a bitch."

12:11.773 --> 12:14.734
So Caro laid him out
with a blow.

12:16.611 --> 12:20.282
Basically our job was

12:20.365 --> 12:22.784
to stand Kiki up
again and again.

12:22.868 --> 12:25.745
And Caro said,
"Tie this bastard up for me!"

12:27.289 --> 12:31.084
And they cut the cords
from the curtains.

12:31.168 --> 12:34.546
And with those cords,
they bound his feet and hands.

12:34.629 --> 12:37.215
No shirt, no pants.

12:37.299 --> 12:39.009
Just underpants.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.679
They took off all his clothes,
just his underwear.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.476
INTERVIEWER: What kind of
torture did they do?

12:47.559 --> 12:51.897
LIRA:
Blows, burns with cigarettes,

12:51.980 --> 12:55.859
jumping on his chest, kicks.

12:58.320 --> 13:00.322
BERRELLEZ:
And at one point they put
powder on his face

13:00.405 --> 13:04.910
from an AK47 cartridge
and lit it up.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.120
His jaw had been broken,
his teeth knocked out,

13:07.204 --> 13:10.207
his, you know, his skull
was all cracked

13:10.290 --> 13:12.751
from all the beatings
that he had on his head.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.795
He was violated through
the anal cavity.

13:17.214 --> 13:19.174
His ribs were all broken.

13:19.257 --> 13:21.968
So he's been
tortured severely.

13:39.694 --> 13:42.697
LOPEZ:
Two hours after
we brought Kiki,

13:42.781 --> 13:45.033
Felix Gallardo's
group arrived.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.536
Felix Gallardo.

13:49.621 --> 13:55.377
El Chapo and "Los Dormidos"
were bringing the pilot,

13:55.460 --> 13:58.838
they had kidnapped him too.

13:58.922 --> 14:00.715
And they started
torturing him as well.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.133
Same thing.

14:07.806 --> 14:11.017
BERRELLEZ: Rene tells us
that one of the interrogators

14:11.101 --> 14:15.564
was a comandante of the DFS

14:15.647 --> 14:18.483
who asked him
a lot of questions.

14:34.249 --> 14:38.336
And also, he says,
that this Cuban guy,

14:38.420 --> 14:41.715
Cubano was also
interrogating Kiki.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.759
And I'm very curious,
"Who is this Cubano, Rene?"

14:44.843 --> 14:45.927
I says, "Who is this Cubano?"

14:46.011 --> 14:47.929
He says, "I don't know."

14:48.013 --> 14:51.391
LOPEZ: I even asked
Samuel Ramirez once.

14:51.474 --> 14:55.645
"Who's this dude?
He looks Cuban."

14:55.729 --> 14:57.314
"Well, he's also DFS."

14:57.397 --> 14:59.190
That's what Samuel told me.

14:59.274 --> 15:02.485
BERRELLEZ: And the Cubano,
he's the one that brings in

15:02.569 --> 15:06.573
tape recording machines to
tape record the whole thing.

15:06.656 --> 15:09.242
They were tape recording
everything they were
asking him.

15:09.326 --> 15:13.747
It was a tape recorder -
black color, double cassette.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.750
BERRELLEZ: And I ask him,

15:16.833 --> 15:18.335
"What were they asking Kiki?"

15:18.418 --> 15:20.879
"They were asking him
about ,

15:20.962 --> 15:24.215
what he knew about
the politicos protecting
the drug lords."

15:24.299 --> 15:25.925
"And what would he answer?"

15:26.009 --> 15:30.221
Kiki would say...
"I know nothing about that."

15:30.305 --> 15:32.265
They would also ask him about

15:32.349 --> 15:35.143
the Contras in Nicaragua.

15:35.226 --> 15:39.731
And Kiki kept answering,
"I know nothing, sir."

15:39.814 --> 15:42.442
LIRA:
They would not stop
asking him the same questions.

15:42.525 --> 15:45.862
what had he found out
about the CIA,

15:45.945 --> 15:48.573
what investigations
he had into the CIA,

15:48.657 --> 15:52.535
the nexus of the CIA
with drug trafficking,

15:52.619 --> 15:55.205
and what he knew about
the relationship

15:55.288 --> 15:59.167
between the Mexican government,
CIA and the Narcos.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.212
INTERVIEWER: And was he
screaming, or begging?

16:02.295 --> 16:05.674
Well, the last time
I saw him, he couldn't...

16:05.757 --> 16:07.050
he couldn't talk anymore.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.928
He could hardly speak, then.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.097
But he did beg them -

16:12.180 --> 16:14.683
to not hurt him anymore,
because he didn't know anything.

17:04.149 --> 17:06.234
BERRELLEZ: Fonseca's not happy
with the way it's going.

17:06.317 --> 17:09.571
Kiki's in real bad shape.

17:09.654 --> 17:12.866
He sees him and he gets mad
at Caro Quintero

17:12.949 --> 17:14.701
and he says .

17:14.784 --> 17:16.745
"This wasn't supposed to happen.
The guy's not in good shape,

17:16.828 --> 17:17.954
get a doctor over here."

17:18.037 --> 17:20.623
They sent for the doctor,

17:20.707 --> 17:23.251
who was Ernesto Fonseca's
chief doctor,

17:23.334 --> 17:26.838
Humberto Alvarez Machain.

17:26.921 --> 17:29.549
BERRELLEZ:
And he looks at Camarena
and he says,

17:29.632 --> 17:31.176
"He's not in good shape.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.136
I've got to get him
to a hospital

17:33.219 --> 17:36.097
or this guy's
not gonna make it."

17:36.181 --> 17:40.018
And Fonseca says,
"Okay, get him, let's
take him to a hospital."

17:40.101 --> 17:42.270
And Caro Quintero says,
"No, you can't take
this guy to a hospital.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.314
Are you kidding me?
This guy's DEA."

17:44.397 --> 17:46.775
Fonseca didn't agree.

17:46.858 --> 17:48.943
He wanted to release him,

17:49.027 --> 17:52.322
Fonseca wanted to take him
to a hospital to be saved.

17:55.992 --> 17:58.995
LOPEZ:
We left the Lope de Vega house,

17:59.078 --> 18:02.624
at like 7:00 or 8:00 PM.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.959
We left with Ernesto Fonseca.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.339
BERRELLEZ: After he leaves,

18:09.422 --> 18:12.801
Dr. Machain starts taking
orders from Caro Quintero.

18:12.884 --> 18:14.427
He says, "We want to
keep interrogating him,

18:14.511 --> 18:16.805
the guy keeps-- keeps
going unconscious."

18:16.888 --> 18:19.140
The body can only take so much.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.684
So Humberto Alvarez Machain
was brought in

18:21.768 --> 18:25.855
and he would administer
medication to Camarena

18:25.939 --> 18:29.359
to revive him so
the torture could continue.

18:37.992 --> 18:40.203
MIKA: Many a night
I went to bed by myself.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.330
But when Kiki was home,

18:42.413 --> 18:43.915
I would wake up in
the middle of the night

18:43.998 --> 18:46.042
and kinda try to
feel him with my leg,

18:46.125 --> 18:48.795
and just feel
the relief that he's home.

18:51.673 --> 18:56.928
But that night,
I did not wake up at all.

18:57.011 --> 18:59.764
And when I woke up
and saw that he was--

18:59.848 --> 19:02.684
he had not come home,
I panicked.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.650
Then I called his partner
and I said,

19:10.733 --> 19:14.070
"Kiki didn't come home."

19:14.153 --> 19:16.948
He said, "Didn't he
meet you for lunch?"

19:17.031 --> 19:19.909
And my heart
just dropped again,

19:19.993 --> 19:23.121
I knew that they did not know
he was missing.

19:35.884 --> 19:38.678
When I got to the Consulate,
Kiki's vehicle was still there.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.350
At that point in time,
it became very obvious...

19:44.434 --> 19:47.353
well, it was probable
that he had been

19:47.437 --> 19:49.898
kidnapped by
drug traffickers

19:49.981 --> 19:52.275
and we began
to try to find him.

19:52.358 --> 19:53.860
The secretaries
came to the office,

19:53.943 --> 19:57.363
made phone calls
to the hospitals,

19:57.447 --> 20:01.075
the city morgue,
things like that, to no avail.

20:01.159 --> 20:04.954
I notified my superiors
in Mexico City,

20:05.038 --> 20:06.497
I notified
the Consul General.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.791
Those people started
the wheels moving

20:08.875 --> 20:11.336
to inform the United States
government in Washington DC

20:11.419 --> 20:14.464
that we had a federal agent
missing in Mexico.

20:16.174 --> 20:18.551
MIKA:
I knew, without a doubt,

20:18.635 --> 20:19.886
that someone had taken him.

20:19.969 --> 20:22.513
It was not gonna be good.

20:22.597 --> 20:25.808
And all I could think of
doing is praying

20:25.892 --> 20:29.687
that they would return him,
that they would not kill him.

20:36.444 --> 20:40.907
MEDRANO: Kiki Camarena
is tortured for 36 hours.

20:40.990 --> 20:42.617
And at this time
in the interrogation,

20:42.700 --> 20:44.953
you can tell
from his responses,

20:45.036 --> 20:49.582
he's a beaten man already,
he's barely hanging on.

20:49.666 --> 20:52.669
So, his answers
are very low key

20:52.752 --> 20:55.880
and in a very low volume.

20:55.964 --> 20:57.340
And then,
every once in a while,

20:57.423 --> 20:59.217
interspersed with,

20:59.300 --> 21:02.512
"Please don't hit me anymore."

21:07.767 --> 21:09.394
MIKA: The first day
that he was gone,

21:09.477 --> 21:12.230
I worried
whether he had eaten,

21:12.313 --> 21:14.983
I worried whether he was cold.

21:15.066 --> 21:19.320
Because, unconsciously
I did not want to think

21:19.404 --> 21:22.991
that he was, no,
he was not coming back.

21:23.074 --> 21:25.785
That I would never
see him again.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.793
After he was gone two days,

21:33.876 --> 21:36.921
I got a...

21:37.005 --> 21:40.133
a horrible pain
in my stomach

21:40.216 --> 21:45.388
and it was like
I just wanted to scream.

21:45.471 --> 21:49.308
My gut was telling me
he was gone.

21:57.358 --> 21:59.902
LOPEZ: Early the next morning,
Fonseca receives a phone call,

21:59.986 --> 22:01.779
telling him that
there was trouble,

22:01.863 --> 22:06.701
that the gringo was dying.

22:06.784 --> 22:10.705
It was around 6:00, 7:00 AM,

22:10.788 --> 22:13.124
when we arrived at
Lope de Vega.

22:38.399 --> 22:40.276
When we arrived
with Ernesto Fonseca,

22:40.359 --> 22:42.361
Caro Quintero was sitting
there under an umbrella.

22:42.445 --> 22:44.864
Fonseca said,
"What happened, buddy?"

22:44.947 --> 22:47.992
Caro said, "What happened
is what had to happen."

22:48.076 --> 22:51.496
"But that was
not the agreement."

22:51.579 --> 22:52.663
"Well, it was
not the agreement,

22:52.747 --> 22:54.916
but that's how things went."

22:54.999 --> 22:57.585
Fonseca said,
"You son of a bitch,

22:57.668 --> 22:59.128
this has totally
gone to shit."

22:59.212 --> 23:01.339
"We are going to
end up fucked."

23:01.422 --> 23:03.633
Ernesto Fonseca told Caro.

23:06.886 --> 23:10.431
"This mess is yours
to fix, asshole!"

23:10.515 --> 23:13.184
And Caro said,
"We have done worse things

23:13.267 --> 23:14.811
"and what has happened to us?

23:14.894 --> 23:19.690
You know very well that
here in Mexico, we rule."

23:19.774 --> 23:21.859
"No fucking way,

23:21.943 --> 23:25.029
the devil will take us
with this fight."

23:25.113 --> 23:28.825
And Caro said, "Leave this
fucking situation to me,

23:28.908 --> 23:31.119
I will resolve it."

23:31.202 --> 23:32.995
Fonseca says, "No, you're
not going to resolve shit.

23:33.079 --> 23:36.415
This fucking shit
cannot be resolved."

23:36.499 --> 23:40.044
Fonseca slapped Caro Quintero.

23:40.128 --> 23:43.089
Because I was
protecting Fonseca,

23:43.172 --> 23:47.218
I had to be watching
Caro Quintero's bodyguards

23:47.301 --> 23:50.429
to make sure they were not
going to kill us.

23:50.513 --> 23:53.182
Caro's men all
put
rounds into the rifles,

23:53.266 --> 23:54.642
and of course,
Fonseca has more men,

23:54.725 --> 23:56.853
and they all point
at Caro's men.

23:56.936 --> 24:01.524
And Fonseca then says,

24:01.607 --> 24:03.234
"You're doing this,
you're gonna pay for this."

24:03.317 --> 24:06.154
LIRA:
I escorted Fonseca to his house.

24:06.237 --> 24:07.989
And he arrived very angry.

24:08.072 --> 24:11.951
He grabbed his AK-47 and
fired off a whole magazine.

24:12.034 --> 24:15.079
I think it was 60 bullets.

24:15.163 --> 24:17.498
He emptied it all.

24:17.582 --> 24:19.625
And he wouldn't stop drinking.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.627
Drinking, and drinking.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.423
He's going crazy mad.

24:25.506 --> 24:28.426
"We are in deep shit!

24:28.509 --> 24:31.804
We are all gonna pay for
Caro's fucking mistake."

24:33.181 --> 24:34.891
From there on out,

24:34.974 --> 24:38.227
Ernesto Fonseca was fucked.

24:42.648 --> 24:47.111
That night they went to
bury the bodies.

24:47.195 --> 24:48.279
INTERVIEWER:
Who buried the bodies?

24:48.362 --> 24:49.864
"Los Dormidos."

24:49.947 --> 24:52.700
Because they were
in charge of burials.

24:52.783 --> 24:55.620
Of killing people
and burying them there.

24:55.703 --> 24:58.206
At La Primavera forest,

24:58.289 --> 24:59.999
that was basically
their graveyard.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.126
Those lands belonged to
Ruben Zuno Arce.

25:04.337 --> 25:08.132
All the La Primavera lands,
those were Zuno's lands.

25:08.216 --> 25:11.010
Same as the house at
Lope de Vega.

25:14.347 --> 25:17.141
BERRELLEZ:
And they have Zavala,
Kiki's pilot, the informant,

25:17.225 --> 25:18.976
and he's alive.

25:19.060 --> 25:20.895
And the pilot was thrown in
the same hole with Kiki

25:20.978 --> 25:23.773
and he was buried alive.

25:31.030 --> 25:34.116
The U.S. government is
mounting an unprecedented
effort this weekend

25:34.200 --> 25:37.078
to find a kidnapped
American narcotics agent
and his captors.

25:38.579 --> 25:41.123
JORDAN:
Every office was working 24/7.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.459
Kiki was the number
one priority.

25:44.752 --> 25:46.796
We have to send
a clear message

25:46.879 --> 25:49.340
to all parties concerned:
traffickers, law enforcement,

25:49.423 --> 25:52.343
businessmen alike
that we want something
done about it,

25:52.426 --> 25:53.594
we want our agent back.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.641
NARRATOR:
When U.S. authorities
ordered the crackdown,

25:58.724 --> 26:01.060
they knew chances were slim
they'd find any trace

26:01.143 --> 26:03.896
of kidnapped Agent
Enrique Camarena.

26:03.980 --> 26:07.316
MEDRANO: We told
the Mexican government,
"give us our guy back."

26:07.400 --> 26:09.360
They took their time,
they obstructed.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.529
But what got the job done,

26:11.612 --> 26:13.030
and this was unprecedented

26:13.114 --> 26:15.491
and never to be repeated
to this day,

26:15.574 --> 26:18.577
the Mexican border
was shut down.

26:21.372 --> 26:25.251
And as that pressure grew,
the Mexican government

26:25.334 --> 26:28.504
and the drug dealers
had to scramble.

26:28.587 --> 26:30.840
What were they gonna say,
what were they gonna do,

26:30.923 --> 26:32.466
who were they gonna turn over?

26:45.313 --> 26:48.316
REPORTER: The man being hunted
is Rafael Caro Quintero,

26:48.399 --> 26:49.984
a major cocaine trafficker.

26:50.067 --> 26:53.112
This is the man in charge
of finding Caro Quintero,

26:53.195 --> 26:55.323
Commander Armando Pavon,

26:55.406 --> 26:58.117
the head of a Mexican
federal task force.

26:58.200 --> 27:01.662
Pavon Reyes was a Mexican
federal judicial police agent.

27:01.746 --> 27:03.998
He was sent from Mexico City

27:04.081 --> 27:08.627
to be the supervisor/comandante
of the group

27:08.711 --> 27:10.254
that was sent up
to help us look for Kiki.

27:34.987 --> 27:39.617
We escorted Caro Quintero
to the airport.

27:42.453 --> 27:43.704
When we arrived
at the airport,

27:43.788 --> 27:46.540
there was a group
of DEA agents

27:46.624 --> 27:48.626
and a group of the DFS.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.628
Everybody's got,
pointing guns at each other,

27:50.711 --> 27:52.088
the DEA agents are there,

27:52.171 --> 27:54.715
and the comandante
that's working with him,

27:54.799 --> 27:57.176
Armando Pavon Reyes
was with the DEA agents.

27:57.259 --> 28:00.596
He talks to Caro Quintero,
he hugs him,

28:00.679 --> 28:03.057
and then lets him go.

28:04.892 --> 28:07.645
And Caro Quintero
gets on the plane,

28:07.728 --> 28:09.980
and right before
the plane takes off,

28:10.064 --> 28:12.024
he gets a bottle of champagne,
and he tells them,

28:12.108 --> 28:17.279
"My children, next time,
bring better weapons,
ha, ha, ha, ha, ha."

28:17.363 --> 28:19.448
And the plane takes off.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.286
The agents ask
Pavon Reyes, the comandante
who hugged Caro Quintero,

28:24.370 --> 28:25.871
they said, "Why did you
hug him and let him go?"

28:25.955 --> 28:27.665
And he says,
"That wasn't Caro Quintero,

28:27.748 --> 28:29.291
"you guys don't even know
who Caro Quintero is.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.877
"That was a DFS comandante
friend of mine.

28:31.961 --> 28:35.506
And all those guys that were
there protecting him,
they're all DFS."

28:37.675 --> 28:39.885
LOPEZ:
Caro got on the plane and

28:39.969 --> 28:43.722
gave an envelope to
Pavon Reyes.

28:43.806 --> 28:46.976
Supposedly it contained
60 million pesos.

28:47.059 --> 28:49.603
But we didn't see the amount.
We just saw the envelope.

29:04.785 --> 29:07.037
They dug up the bodies,

29:07.121 --> 29:09.999
because the fight was now
on their doorstep.

29:10.082 --> 29:13.043
They decided to take
the bodies out of Jalisco,

29:13.127 --> 29:16.130
to move the problem
to another state.

29:16.213 --> 29:19.049
They decided to
move them to Michoacan.

29:22.219 --> 29:25.931
When we arrived
at La Primavera forest,

29:26.015 --> 29:27.391
El Chapo and "Los Dormidos"

29:27.475 --> 29:30.144
came out with
the bodies in bags.

29:30.227 --> 29:33.772
They threw the bodies
in the truck.

29:33.856 --> 29:36.192
And we drove to Michoacan.

29:50.080 --> 29:53.209
When we arrived,
Pavon Reyes was there.

29:53.292 --> 29:55.419
He assigned one of his agents

29:55.503 --> 29:58.881
to show us where
to dump the bodies.

30:01.217 --> 30:04.803
Outside of town
there was a ditch,

30:04.887 --> 30:06.889
he said, "Throw them here."

30:06.972 --> 30:09.058
They grabbed the bags,

30:09.141 --> 30:10.476
out of the van

30:10.559 --> 30:11.852
and threw the bodies
in a ditch,

30:11.936 --> 30:13.896
and covered them
with branches.

32:05.215 --> 32:07.384
MIKA: The children didn't
have the privacy.

32:10.095 --> 32:13.390
I remember Danny
coming home one day

32:13.474 --> 32:14.808
with a TIME Magazine
and asking me,

32:14.892 --> 32:17.728
"Mom is this true?"

32:21.148 --> 32:24.234
I had to tell him...

32:24.318 --> 32:27.029
that he had been tortured.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.116
He was six years old.

32:48.759 --> 32:51.387
LOPEZ:
After all that had happened,

32:51.470 --> 32:53.347
Fonseca was going from
one place to another.

32:56.350 --> 32:58.811
LIRA:
One day Fonseca was driving,

32:58.894 --> 33:01.480
Samuel in the front,
me in the back seat.

33:01.563 --> 33:05.401
And Fonseca
told Samuel Ramirez,

33:05.484 --> 33:06.902
"This has gone to hell,

33:06.985 --> 33:08.445
the politicians
have abandoned us."

33:08.529 --> 33:09.738
That's what he said.

33:11.115 --> 33:14.618
So we changed houses
every night.

33:14.702 --> 33:17.204
We would arrive at six o'clock
in the afternoon,

33:17.287 --> 33:20.457
and by midnight, we were
already in another house.

33:20.541 --> 33:22.876
By four in the morning,
we were in another one.

33:22.960 --> 33:25.212
We never knew where
we were going next.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.759
GODOY:
It was a dark night.

33:30.843 --> 33:34.972
You could feel
the devil's presence.

33:35.055 --> 33:37.975
A storm with
thunder, lightning.

33:38.058 --> 33:40.978
The fucking horse from
the devil, neighing.

33:42.438 --> 33:44.606
LIRA:
The lights went out,

33:44.690 --> 33:47.651
so I told Fonseca,
"I'm going to buy a fuse.

33:47.735 --> 33:50.612
And I'm going to take the
opportunity to go to roll call."

33:50.696 --> 33:52.448
"Ah, it's okay, you can go,"
Fonseca said.

33:52.531 --> 33:55.743
That's when I went to
the precinct and stayed there.

33:55.826 --> 33:58.787
But the truth was,
when I heard

33:58.871 --> 34:00.372
that the politicians...

34:00.456 --> 34:01.832
had abandoned him,

34:01.915 --> 34:06.754
I knew the whole thing
was fucked.

34:08.088 --> 34:09.631
I was carrying my AK-47,

34:09.715 --> 34:11.759
a 9-millimeter
and two grenades.

34:11.842 --> 34:14.094
I wasn't going to
let them catch me.

34:15.554 --> 34:17.347
That was the moment
I abandoned everything,

34:17.431 --> 34:19.725
and from then on,
always running.

34:32.279 --> 34:33.864
REPORTER:
The man said to
be at the center

34:33.947 --> 34:35.866
of much of the illicit
drug traffic in Mexico

34:35.949 --> 34:37.618
was captured today.

34:37.701 --> 34:40.954
Rafael Caro Quintero
was arrested in Costa Rica.

34:41.038 --> 34:43.290
He's considered
the prime suspect

34:43.373 --> 34:46.418
in the kidnap and murder
of American drug agent
Enrique Camarena.

34:48.462 --> 34:51.173
In a Mexican prison,
at a news conference,

34:51.256 --> 34:54.092
he laughs and jokes
with local reporters.

34:54.176 --> 34:56.136
REPORTER:
Why did you want to
visit Costa Rica?

34:56.220 --> 34:57.429
I was told
it's a quiet country,

34:57.513 --> 35:01.433
but as far as I've seen,
it's not.

35:01.517 --> 35:04.603
Hey, Rafa, do you consider
yourself a bad guy?

35:04.686 --> 35:06.688
- No. No.
- Why?

35:06.772 --> 35:11.235
If there's anything I have,
it's love for everybody.

35:11.318 --> 35:13.529
- You've never hurt anyone?
- Of course not.

35:13.612 --> 35:14.988
And I don't plan on it either.

35:15.072 --> 35:17.741
Rafael, did you have
anything to do

35:17.825 --> 35:19.952
with the death
of Enrique Camarena?

35:20.035 --> 35:23.872
Negative. I never saw
or met him.

35:23.956 --> 35:27.334
- Zavala, the pilot, neither?
- No. Nobody.

35:27.417 --> 35:30.754
I have nothing to do with...

35:30.838 --> 35:32.714
What was the name of
the murdered guy?

35:32.798 --> 35:35.175
- Enrique Camarena.
- It has nothing to do with me.

35:35.259 --> 35:37.052
Or Mr. Ernesto Fonseca either.

35:37.135 --> 35:39.137
Did you know there were
DEA agents working in Mexico?

35:39.221 --> 35:41.181
No, I never knew that.

35:41.265 --> 35:45.227
They knew about your houses
and your ranches.

35:45.310 --> 35:47.145
Maybe so.

35:47.229 --> 35:50.023
Maybe Camarena went there for
a stroll sometime before.

35:50.107 --> 35:52.568
Do you think the gringos
are meddlesome?

35:52.651 --> 35:54.695
No, because
I don't know them.

35:54.778 --> 35:57.155
They want you to be extradited
to the United States.

35:57.239 --> 35:59.825
What else do they want?

35:59.908 --> 36:01.743
I'd like many things too,
but you can't have it all.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.495
I have no pending business
with the United States.

36:03.579 --> 36:04.580
So there's no reason
to extradite you?

36:04.663 --> 36:06.665
None. That's negative.

36:09.167 --> 36:12.504
Rafael, what's your real
relationship with Fonseca?

36:12.588 --> 36:14.089
How did you meet him?

36:14.172 --> 36:17.843
I've known him
since I was born.

36:23.557 --> 36:26.518
LOPEZ:
When they told Ernesto Fonseca

36:26.602 --> 36:29.354
that Caro was caught,

36:29.438 --> 36:32.149
then he felt more desperate.

36:33.400 --> 36:34.651
He was thinking about escaping

36:34.735 --> 36:37.195
to El Salvador or Guatemala.

36:37.279 --> 36:39.072
But finally one morning,

36:39.156 --> 36:42.075
he decided we should hide
in Puerto Vallarta.

36:53.629 --> 36:57.925
We were guarding
Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo...

36:59.593 --> 37:04.640
and we had seen in the news

37:04.723 --> 37:08.352
that Rafael Caro Quintero
had been caught

37:08.435 --> 37:09.603
in Costa Rica.

37:09.686 --> 37:13.023
Then, Ernesto Fonseca realized

37:13.106 --> 37:15.359
he was going down, too.

37:15.442 --> 37:20.280
He would call the DFS,
but they all ignored him.

37:20.364 --> 37:22.741
Nobody answered him.

37:28.622 --> 37:31.500
GODOY:
Fonseca was very drunk.

37:31.583 --> 37:35.295
He was alone in his bedroom,

37:35.379 --> 37:38.757
listening to one tape
over and over,

37:38.840 --> 37:40.592
a cassette tape.

37:43.178 --> 37:46.098
He listened to the tape
again and again.

37:46.181 --> 37:48.558
On it I heard strange grunts.

37:50.310 --> 37:53.105
"Enough.
Leave me.

37:53.188 --> 37:55.148
Don't torture me anymore."

37:55.232 --> 37:56.441
"Hey" (with Cuban accent).

37:56.525 --> 37:59.027
And I heard another voice,

37:59.111 --> 38:01.738
Caribbean, like Cuban.

38:01.822 --> 38:05.325
"Hey, brother, you have
to tell us what you did.

38:05.409 --> 38:07.619
What did you report
to Washington?"

38:07.703 --> 38:09.371
"Nothing, I didn't
report anything.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.498
"I didn't get any money.

38:11.581 --> 38:14.418
Let me go, please.
Don't torture me anymore."

38:14.501 --> 38:18.422
"What the fuck, you have
to tell us, bastard!

38:18.505 --> 38:20.507
Who are you reporting to
in Washington?"

38:21.883 --> 38:23.260
"To no one.

38:23.343 --> 38:26.304
"I didn't report to nobody.

38:26.388 --> 38:28.473
No one."

38:28.557 --> 38:33.270
LOPEZ:
When Fonseca was listening to
the tape in his bedroom,

38:33.353 --> 38:37.190
I heard the voice of
the Governor of Jalisco,

38:37.274 --> 38:40.360
also the voice of
a federal comandante.

38:40.444 --> 38:42.654
You could hear those voices.

38:42.738 --> 38:45.282
INTERVIEWER: But why was he
listening to the recording?

38:46.616 --> 38:48.285
GODOY:
He wouldn't stop listening to it

38:48.368 --> 38:50.287
because Don Ernesto knew

38:50.370 --> 38:53.999
he was doomed,
that they would follow us

38:54.082 --> 38:55.709
to the end of the earth.

39:12.392 --> 39:14.895
The sun was setting...

39:14.978 --> 39:18.607
the night was approaching...

39:18.690 --> 39:20.734
They surrounded us,

39:20.817 --> 39:22.569
lots of manpower.

39:22.652 --> 39:25.113
I was told,
"Surrender your badge."

39:25.197 --> 39:28.450
I said, "No fucking way,
you come and get me."

39:28.533 --> 39:31.078
"Come out with your hands up!"

39:31.161 --> 39:33.914
yelled the rural cop
in charge of the raid.

39:33.997 --> 39:37.459
And then the shooting began.

39:37.542 --> 39:40.670
Against the soldiers,
and the rural cops.

39:40.754 --> 39:43.215
We were being careful
to not hit our partners,

39:43.298 --> 39:46.009
who they were using
as human shields.

39:46.093 --> 39:49.638
Ernesto Fonseca was
coming down the stairs,

39:49.721 --> 39:51.973
and I told him, "Hey boss,

39:52.057 --> 39:54.309
the armored cars are
over there, let's use them.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.186
Let's go!"

39:56.269 --> 39:59.523
"No, no, wait. I'll fix this
right now," Fonseca said.

39:59.606 --> 40:02.526
And Fonseca said,
"Don't shoot.

40:02.609 --> 40:04.736
"Don't shoot,
everything's arranged.

40:04.820 --> 40:05.862
We'll surrender."

40:05.946 --> 40:08.240
"What are you saying, sir?

40:08.323 --> 40:10.826
Are we turning ourselves in?"

40:10.909 --> 40:12.911
"Yes, everything's arranged."

40:16.957 --> 40:20.377
I was walking behind Fonseca,
and I stopped abruptly,

40:20.460 --> 40:22.337
because Samuel yanked me back.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.840
That's what saved me.

40:29.386 --> 40:30.971
And I told Godoy,
"Let's fucking run, Godoy."

40:31.054 --> 40:32.848
"No, wait,
let's see what happens."

40:32.931 --> 40:34.933
"Dude, they're gonna
cuff your ass.

40:35.016 --> 40:37.102
Let's get the hell
out of here."

40:37.185 --> 40:38.854
"No, no," he said.

40:38.937 --> 40:42.440
And I said, "Well,
I'm out of here."

40:45.110 --> 40:50.031
Then, Don Ernesto Fonseca
and I were handcuffed.

40:50.115 --> 40:53.410
Handcuffed to each other.

40:53.493 --> 40:58.373
I had my AR-15 and my .45.

40:58.456 --> 41:00.125
If they followed me,

41:00.208 --> 41:03.128
I was ready to shoot
the fuck out of them.

41:03.211 --> 41:05.463
And I escaped to the beach.

41:05.547 --> 41:08.216
The beach was
right in front of me.

41:12.053 --> 41:15.307
It was already
beginning to get dark.

41:16.433 --> 41:19.686
When I got to the beach,

41:19.769 --> 41:23.481
I dug a hole in the sand
and hid the weapons.

41:24.858 --> 41:27.194
I can't tell you
any more because

41:27.277 --> 41:30.947
I can't remember
what happened that night,

41:31.031 --> 41:33.033
until the sun woke me up.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.955
REPORTER: Mexican police
have arrested the man

41:39.039 --> 41:41.833
they describe as the Godfather
of Mexican drug smugglers,

41:41.917 --> 41:46.213
Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo,
and his associates.

41:46.296 --> 41:48.590
Wearing borrowed sunglasses
and a smile,

41:48.673 --> 41:51.760
crime boss Ernesto Fonseca
was arraigned today in
Mexican federal court.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.471
He is charged with
kidnapping and murder
in connection with

41:54.554 --> 41:56.848
the killing of U.S. Drug Agent
Enrique Camarena.

41:56.932 --> 41:59.643
Also charged is one of
his men, Samuel Ramirez.

41:59.726 --> 42:03.688
Fonseca and his gang
were picked up Monday
in Puerto Vallarta

42:03.772 --> 42:06.858
after a gun battle
with Mexican authorities.

42:15.575 --> 42:18.119
GODOY:
We were just fucking soldiers,

42:18.203 --> 42:20.288
pure slag, pure police waste,

42:20.372 --> 42:22.999
we were simply being used.

42:23.083 --> 42:26.419
We were 26 bastards.

42:58.952 --> 43:00.996
He had a Cuban accent.

43:01.079 --> 43:03.832
One time I even asked Samuel,

43:03.915 --> 43:07.002
"Who is this dude
who looks Cuban?"

43:07.085 --> 43:08.878
"Well, he's also DFS."

43:08.962 --> 43:10.880
That's what he told me.

43:10.964 --> 43:13.800
LIRA:
Max Gomez, yes, Max Gomez.

43:13.883 --> 43:16.177
GODOY:
I saw him at some of
the safe houses,

43:16.261 --> 43:18.847
taking bags of money,

43:18.930 --> 43:21.266
of narco dollars.

43:21.349 --> 43:23.310
And I kept wondering,
what's a Cuban doing

43:23.393 --> 43:26.563
running around with all
these Mexicans and stuff?

43:26.646 --> 43:29.566
And I'm being told that
he's there interrogating
Kiki Camarena.

43:29.649 --> 43:35.322
Who is this...
this unknown Max Gomez?

43:35.405 --> 43:37.198
LIRA:
Yes, Max Gomez.

43:37.282 --> 43:42.203
He tried to hide under

43:42.287 --> 43:43.955
a pseudonym,

43:44.039 --> 43:46.666
but later on,
we learned his real name.

43:46.750 --> 43:49.169
Felix Rodriguez.

43:49.252 --> 43:52.088
Right away, I go to
all my people

43:52.172 --> 43:53.673
and I says,
"Run this guy all over."

43:55.842 --> 43:57.761
And he lit up
like a Christmas tree.

43:57.844 --> 44:01.139
I mean, this guy
is all over the place.

44:01.222 --> 44:04.017
This guy is CIA.
