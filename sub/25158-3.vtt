WEBVTT

00:00.008 --> 00:01.909
<i>Previously on "Dietland"...</i>

00:01.911 --> 00:03.244
I can't authorize this surgery

00:03.246 --> 00:04.745
unless you lose another 15 pounds.

00:04.747 --> 00:06.763
Doesn't my insurance cover most of this?

00:06.774 --> 00:08.387
You need to pay in full for your visits.

00:08.398 --> 00:11.502
- Any word back from Malleck Ferguson?
- I've tried everywhere. Nothing.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.521
He's probably on a shoot.

00:15.525 --> 00:16.590
Oh! Hey!

00:16.911 --> 00:18.678
I want you to go see someone.

00:18.680 --> 00:21.848
I think that you could do great,
meaningful work

00:21.850 --> 00:23.349
that could help a lot of women.

00:23.351 --> 00:24.715
And when you complete the program,

00:24.725 --> 00:27.420
I will write you a check for $20,000.

00:27.422 --> 00:29.789
The first step
would be getting off the Y.

00:37.223 --> 00:39.324
I asked for dressing on the side.

00:39.334 --> 00:41.760
But the chef didn't dress it, ma'am.

00:41.770 --> 00:43.395
Where's my warm lemon vinaigrette?

00:47.175 --> 00:49.167
<i>Jennifer was dropping men from the sky,</i>

00:49.177 --> 00:51.269
<i>but none of us knew that yet.</i>

00:51.279 --> 00:54.873
<i>All I knew was, I had a date
with Verena Baptist.</i>

00:54.883 --> 00:57.008
Nothing is off-limits, Plum.

00:57.018 --> 00:59.744
<i>No food, no thought.</i>

00:59.754 --> 01:03.748
The New Baptist Plan actually
isn't about deprivation,

01:03.758 --> 01:06.851
it's about being kinder to yourself.

01:06.861 --> 01:09.187
OK. <i>Sounds</i> good.

01:09.197 --> 01:12.524
<i> It sounded like a woo-woo
version of Waist Watchers.</i>

01:12.534 --> 01:15.226
As we discussed, for this to
work, you need to go off the Y.

01:15.236 --> 01:17.962
That's all the first phase consists of.

01:17.972 --> 01:20.359
When your body's gotten used
to a drug like that, detox

01:20.370 --> 01:23.805
can be... an adventure.

01:24.152 --> 01:25.585
Well, done.

01:26.648 --> 01:28.714
I flushed 'em yesterday.

01:30.385 --> 01:33.645
How long have you been taking Y again?

01:33.655 --> 01:36.314
Nine years... give or take?

01:36.324 --> 01:41.619
OK. So when you've been taking
antidepressants for that long,

01:41.629 --> 01:44.722
the way to go off them is to taper
slowly over several months.

01:44.732 --> 01:47.892
Going cold turkey's not
safe, or pleasant.

01:47.902 --> 01:50.829
I need you call your doctor,
get a new prescription.

01:50.839 --> 01:54.232
We want to start by cutting your
usual dose maybe by a quarter,

01:54.242 --> 01:55.741
see how you tolerate it.

01:57.971 --> 02:00.230
OK. Absolutely, I'll do that.

02:00.241 --> 02:02.471
In the meantime, let's
brainstorm some things...

02:02.482 --> 02:04.342
Verena, can I steal you for two seconds?

02:04.353 --> 02:06.970
It's about you-know-what.

02:07.581 --> 02:09.447
Excuse me.

02:12.293 --> 02:14.018
- Hey.
- Hi.

02:14.028 --> 02:16.616
I see you signed on
for Verena's torture sessions.

02:16.627 --> 02:19.324
Good for you. She saved my ass,

02:19.334 --> 02:21.192
and I came in here...

02:21.202 --> 02:23.962
Barbara, let's not scare Plum off.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.299
<i>You know that line,
"I'd never want to belong</i>

02:28.309 --> 02:30.635
<i>to a club that would have me
as a member"?</i>

02:30.645 --> 02:33.505
<i>That's how I felt about Calliope House.</i>

02:33.515 --> 02:35.773
<i>Verena may have been well-meaning,</i>

02:35.783 --> 02:38.843
<i>but she was also the poster
child for skinny entitlement.</i>

02:38.853 --> 02:44.123
<i>She thinks she gets it, but she's
never been in my extra-wide shoes.</i>

02:46.294 --> 02:48.953
Thank you for your patience.

02:48.963 --> 02:52.357
I know you have no reason to trust me.

02:52.367 --> 02:53.649
So...

02:54.981 --> 02:57.315
here is proof that I am for real.

03:00.408 --> 03:03.801
If you want, call the bank, see that
the funds are there. Be my guest.

03:03.818 --> 03:08.388
All I ask is that you wait to
cash it till you finish the plan.

03:10.084 --> 03:12.143
<i>Alicia.</i>

03:12.153 --> 03:14.554
<i>This was my golden ticket.</i>

03:16.688 --> 03:18.788
Is there a problem?

03:20.895 --> 03:23.321
Should I have made it out to Plum?

03:23.331 --> 03:26.658
No. No, it's...

03:26.668 --> 03:29.093
perfect.

03:29.103 --> 03:32.230
<i>Calliope House was changing my routine.</i>

03:32.240 --> 03:34.499
<i>And while I desperately
needed the money,</i>

03:34.509 --> 03:37.504
<i>I still wasn't sold
on the New Baptist Plan.</i>

03:46.777 --> 03:49.712
You know, I like it better when you
come in with a good-lookin' detective

03:49.723 --> 03:51.883
- who buys cake.
- Right? Me too.

03:51.893 --> 03:53.885
You should call him.

03:53.895 --> 03:56.688
<i>No.</i> Again, he's just working me.

03:56.698 --> 04:00.458
So? Everybody's working
everybody until they're not.

04:00.468 --> 04:01.893
No, I saw something, Plum...

04:01.903 --> 04:03.561
The way Dominic was lookin' at you.

04:03.571 --> 04:05.029
It was clear, Plum, that man is...

04:05.039 --> 04:07.865
Whatever! He's not even my type.

04:07.875 --> 04:10.902
Dude, you've dated
only one person. Singular.

04:10.912 --> 04:13.104
You have no idea what your type is.

04:13.114 --> 04:15.573
<i>Dude,</i> this is a pointless conversation.

04:15.583 --> 04:18.543
- Even if I did like him...
- You do. I can tell.

04:18.553 --> 04:20.978
Even if I did...

04:20.988 --> 04:23.448
he's just... he just wants me
to talk about the case.

04:23.458 --> 04:25.283
That's called an opening.

04:25.293 --> 04:27.051
Do I have to do
all the work around here?

04:30.498 --> 04:33.992
Return of the Glamazons.

04:34.002 --> 04:35.960
It's awful for business,

04:35.970 --> 04:38.997
but I gotta say, this year,
I'm kinda into Fashion Week.

04:39.007 --> 04:44.002
If you are suddenly straight,
I'm gonna die of confusion.

04:44.012 --> 04:46.170
You're safe.

04:46.180 --> 04:47.839
No, I'm happy for <i> you.</i>

04:47.849 --> 04:50.341
You're doing that article
on the runway show.

04:50.351 --> 04:52.410
This is a good thing.
So when is it again?

04:52.420 --> 04:54.512
And... what are you gonna wear?

04:54.522 --> 04:58.283
I'm not. I am watching it online.

04:58.293 --> 05:00.918
Kitty's assistant gave me a link.

05:00.928 --> 05:03.354
Oh, you're watching it now? Lemme see.

05:03.364 --> 05:05.156
What do we got here?

05:05.166 --> 05:08.359
- What is this?
- I quit Y.

05:08.369 --> 05:13.031
It's phase one
of Verena's New Baptist Plan.

05:13.041 --> 05:15.967
"Side effects include
headaches, nausea, fatigue"...

05:15.977 --> 05:18.169
Well, that's Sunday
morning at my house...

05:18.179 --> 05:20.104
"heart palpitations, brain zaps"...

05:20.114 --> 05:23.141
- What the hell is a brain zap?
- Beats me.

05:23.151 --> 05:27.658
"Obsessive thoughts, paranoia,
hallucinations. Suicidal ideations"?

05:27.669 --> 05:28.670
Ok.

05:28.681 --> 05:30.982
No, no, no, you need
to stay on your meds.

05:30.992 --> 05:32.632
Forget Verena.

05:32.643 --> 05:34.952
You can go through insurance
and get your stomach stapled.

05:34.962 --> 05:38.856
Actually, I can't. I have to pay
out-of-pocket and get reimbursed.

05:38.866 --> 05:42.026
And I need more surgery after
the fact for my excess skin,

05:42.036 --> 05:44.262
which is considered cosmetic,
so they won't pay.

05:44.273 --> 05:45.563
Definitely can't afford that.

05:45.573 --> 05:47.665
I don't know about this, Plum.

05:47.675 --> 05:49.334
Have you vetted this woman?

05:49.344 --> 05:51.077
Yeah. Totally.

05:52.413 --> 05:54.172
I Googled her.

05:54.182 --> 05:57.041
She's given boatloads of money
to all kinds of lefty causes.

05:57.051 --> 05:58.910
OK, fine. Whatever.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.045
At least let me stay with you
till you get off the Y.

06:01.055 --> 06:02.847
It looks like it could be scary.

06:02.857 --> 06:05.416
Come on. I'm the girl
who never gets sick, remember?

06:05.426 --> 06:07.251
This isn't germ warfare.
These are chemicals

06:07.261 --> 06:09.520
that were helping your brain
and now are not.

06:09.530 --> 06:12.090
This is serious, Plum,
you can't take this lightly.

06:12.100 --> 06:15.426
Stop! I'm gonna hole up,
I'll relax, write my piece.

06:15.436 --> 06:18.596
It'll be like a withdrawal-cation...

06:18.606 --> 06:20.398
with some work on the side.

06:20.408 --> 06:23.534
Mm-hm. So you're not just
gonna lay up on the couch

06:23.544 --> 06:25.737
and binge-watch
those stupid nature shows?

06:25.747 --> 06:28.339
No. Working.

06:28.349 --> 06:30.583
The whole time. One hundred percent.

06:38.960 --> 06:40.784
Anyway, I'm going off the grid
for a few days.

06:40.795 --> 06:42.186
I just want to let you know.

06:42.196 --> 06:43.855
To write. I'll call you when I'm done.

06:43.865 --> 06:45.731
All right. Love you, Ma.

07:06.487 --> 07:07.645
<i> Hello.</i>

07:07.655 --> 07:09.080
Oh, hey. Hi.

07:09.090 --> 07:10.548
<i>This is Plum.</i>

07:10.558 --> 07:12.650
<i>Sorry to call instead of text.</i>

07:12.660 --> 07:14.452
No, I'm glad you did. What's up?

07:14.462 --> 07:15.987
Are you... busy?

07:15.997 --> 07:17.655
<i>No, no. Today's my day off.</i>

07:17.665 --> 07:20.224
It's nice to hear your voice.

07:20.234 --> 07:25.963
Um, I just wanted to let you
know that......

07:25.973 --> 07:28.900
- Is everything OK?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

07:28.910 --> 07:31.736
I was gonna call your phone
message and just say,

07:31.746 --> 07:33.271
"Hello, Detective,"

07:33.281 --> 07:35.226
I'm going out of town for a few days

07:35.237 --> 07:36.840
"in case you need
your beauty informant."

07:36.851 --> 07:38.943
And then just, like, hang up.

07:39.476 --> 07:40.875
My what?

07:42.132 --> 07:43.824
Beauty informant.

07:43.858 --> 07:47.418
Like a criminal informant,
but... beautiful.

07:47.428 --> 07:50.588
Oh. Yeah, yeah. Got it.

07:50.598 --> 07:52.523
<i>Hey, while I got you,</i>

07:52.533 --> 07:55.259
<i>do you know someone named Leeta?</i>

07:55.269 --> 07:58.629
You mean that, uh, weird girl
who works in the beauty closet?

07:58.639 --> 07:59.972
Yeah. You know her?

08:01.809 --> 08:03.943
Not really.

08:06.547 --> 08:08.840
Ahh, it's all right.
Don't worry about it.

08:12.520 --> 08:16.147
S... Yeah, so, you know, listen,
have a nice trip, and, uh,

08:16.157 --> 08:18.716
<i>don't be a hero, OK? When
it comes to helping me out.</i>

08:18.733 --> 08:21.514
We still don't know if these hackers
are connected to this homicide.

08:22.830 --> 08:25.623
- W-What homicide?
- <i>All I can say,</i>

08:25.633 --> 08:28.133
somebody in the Austen
Media family was murdered.

08:30.071 --> 08:32.697
Missing fashion photographer
Malleck Ferguson

08:32.707 --> 08:34.065
was found dead today.

08:34.075 --> 08:35.832
A surreal twist?

08:35.842 --> 08:38.836
Witnesses say his body
fell out of the sky.

08:38.846 --> 08:41.339
<i>So far, authorities have no leads,</i>

08:41.349 --> 08:44.041
but the FAA confirms that several planes

08:44.051 --> 08:46.477
were in the area before Ferguson's body

08:46.487 --> 08:48.913
hit a Lower East Side restaurant patio.

08:48.923 --> 08:51.415
More as this wild story develops.

08:51.425 --> 08:53.985
<i> All right, we're clear.</i>

08:53.995 --> 08:56.187
Send regrets to Jason Wu.

08:56.197 --> 08:58.689
I'm absolutely not going
to Yeezy this season.

08:58.699 --> 09:00.858
And find out what time
Victoria's show starts.

09:00.868 --> 09:03.594
I don't want to be sitting there
like some fool, waiting, again.

09:03.604 --> 09:05.897
- If I could go back in time...
- You can't. I just wish

09:05.907 --> 09:08.232
you were capable of learning
from your mistakes.

09:08.242 --> 09:10.768
Confirm my re-see with Rodarte,

09:10.778 --> 09:12.534
and then make sure
the helicopter is there

09:12.545 --> 09:14.211
to take me to the Open. I want...

09:15.349 --> 09:17.608
God! I know we joked about this, but...

09:17.618 --> 09:19.844
- The timing isn't a coincidence.
- Of course not.

09:19.854 --> 09:21.913
And dropping his body out of a plane?

09:21.923 --> 09:25.182
It's Fashion Week. They're already
calling this the Runway Murder.

09:25.192 --> 09:26.884
Focus. Please?

09:26.894 --> 09:29.353
This is bad. It could come back on us.

09:29.363 --> 09:32.023
We stood behind Malleck during
the first few rape allegations

09:32.033 --> 09:33.591
<i>and</i> that media boycott.

09:33.601 --> 09:35.793
How he got that girl
to recant, I'll never...

09:35.803 --> 09:38.537
Green tea, loose leaf,
not in some awful paper cup.

09:41.943 --> 09:44.702
- Not on the record.
- Mm-hm.

09:44.712 --> 09:49.874
We still paid for Malleck's legal
defense and... and his PR team.

09:49.884 --> 09:53.044
I'm sure there's something in all
our leaked information about it.

09:53.054 --> 09:56.247
Well, why would Austen Media
pay for Malleck's legal team?

09:56.257 --> 09:58.716
Because Malleck is...

09:58.726 --> 10:01.085
Was part of the family.

10:01.095 --> 10:02.887
If you, I don't know,

10:02.897 --> 10:05.156
liked to diddle golden retrievers,

10:05.166 --> 10:06.424
we'd do the same thing for you.

10:06.434 --> 10:08.659
Well, fortunately for both of us,

10:08.669 --> 10:09.961
I broke it off with Rover.

10:09.971 --> 10:12.463
Funny.

10:12.473 --> 10:15.766
If you get any Intel on
who's behind this, tell me.

10:15.776 --> 10:17.802
If the monsters who killed Malleck

10:17.812 --> 10:20.137
are the same ones who hacked us,

10:20.155 --> 10:22.823
Stanley, and his family,
could be targets.

10:24.352 --> 10:26.452
I could be a target.

10:28.456 --> 10:30.122
Or me.

10:31.659 --> 10:33.517
Yes. Also that.

10:33.527 --> 10:35.127
Just get on it, will you?

10:37.590 --> 10:39.616
<i>When the body dropped,
I thought it was fake.</i>

10:39.634 --> 10:41.258
<i>Like a Fashion Week stunt?</i>

10:41.268 --> 10:43.194
<i>Or that SVU show was filming.</i>

10:43.204 --> 10:45.696
<i>They're always coming up
with crazy ways to kill people.</i>

10:45.706 --> 10:47.031
<i>That show's been on forever.</i>

10:54.949 --> 10:58.442
<i>♪</i>- <i> So,</i> one bad guy murdered,

10:58.452 --> 11:01.812
<i>one brain zap, and some
remote fashion show viewing...</i>

11:01.822 --> 11:05.349
<i>So far, my withdrawal-cation
didn't seem so bad.</i>

11:05.359 --> 11:09.820
<i>But as some drunken</i> tailgaters and I

11:09.830 --> 11:12.490
<i>were about to find out,
it was just getting started.</i>

11:49.618 --> 11:51.985
<i>The two victims shown
here, French soccer players,</i>

11:51.996 --> 11:53.753
<i>were recently reported missing
from Paris,</i>

11:53.763 --> 11:57.256
<i>and appear to be the latest
victims of the Runway Murders.</i>

11:57.267 --> 11:58.725
I can't watch.

11:58.736 --> 12:00.295
Put it back on, jackass.

12:00.305 --> 12:02.471
Don't talk to him like that, jackass.

12:04.442 --> 12:06.558
<i>... unconfirmed reports of four more men</i>

12:06.569 --> 12:09.037

<i>bringing the possible total
to seven victims.</i>

12:11.916 --> 12:14.208
- It's Jennifer! It has to be.
- Who's Jennifer?

12:14.218 --> 12:16.411
Stay current or you're fired, Ben.

12:16.421 --> 12:18.246
Not really.

12:18.256 --> 12:20.615
Oh, it just makes me sick.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.483
Hey, is Plum working today?

12:22.493 --> 12:24.552
Her singing, it calms me down, you know?

12:24.562 --> 12:26.754
It's like angels humming.

12:26.764 --> 12:28.122
She is not.

12:28.132 --> 12:31.292
Calm yourself by serving my customers.

12:31.302 --> 12:33.394
Absolutely, sir.

12:44.849 --> 12:46.841
Hey, there you are.

12:46.851 --> 12:49.077
- Hi.
- Well, you don't look suicidal to me.

12:49.087 --> 12:51.779
Thanks. I try. What's up?

12:51.789 --> 12:53.981
Listen, why don't you, um,

12:53.991 --> 12:55.483
why don't you stay on your meds

12:55.493 --> 12:56.784
and let Ben be your boyfriend?

12:56.794 --> 12:58.753
- Ugh.
- What? He's adorable.

12:58.763 --> 13:00.621
And your total disinterest in him

13:00.631 --> 13:02.156
got him beggin' like Rolo.

13:02.166 --> 13:03.791
No offense.

13:03.801 --> 13:05.860
He is adorable,
but I can't have sex thoughts

13:05.870 --> 13:08.363
about somebody who thinks
that Greenland is a continent.

13:08.373 --> 13:10.431
Yeah, that is pretty sad.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.133
He has no stomach for the news,

13:12.143 --> 13:14.335
much less my conspiracy theories.

13:14.345 --> 13:16.504
Speaking of which,
these Runway Murders...

13:16.514 --> 13:18.473
- La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!
- What? What?

13:18.483 --> 13:21.109
No. Total media blackout.
I have to work.

13:21.119 --> 13:23.277
I want no negative vibes
while I withdraw.

13:23.287 --> 13:24.458
- Oh, come on...
- I promise,

13:24.469 --> 13:26.180
I will juice with you about everything

13:26.190 --> 13:29.200
- as soon as I'm back on the grid.
- OK, but the soup, right? It's lo-cal...

13:29.211 --> 13:31.052
- I'll talk to you soon.
- Plum...

13:31.062 --> 13:32.720
- Call me, all right?
- Thank you.

13:32.730 --> 13:34.188
<i>Call me!</i>

13:36.534 --> 13:39.727
<i> The withdrawals?
Yeah, they were no joke.</i>

13:39.737 --> 13:41.629
<i>I started</i> seeing <i> things.</i>

13:48.246 --> 13:50.738
<i>I started answering
Kitty's Girls emails...</i>

13:50.748 --> 13:52.840
<i>Inappropriately.</i>

13:52.850 --> 13:55.076
<i>"Before I can answer your question,"</i>

13:55.086 --> 13:57.145
<i>I'd like to ask if you get pleasure</i>

13:57.155 --> 13:59.480
<i>from inserting tampons into your vagina?</i>

13:59.490 --> 14:01.516
<i>Because I don't. But if you do,</i>

14:01.526 --> 14:03.684
<i>"then that's no one's damn business."</i>

14:05.563 --> 14:07.655
<i>At least I was safe in my apartment</i>

14:07.665 --> 14:09.891
<i>with my nature documentaries.</i>

14:09.901 --> 14:12.493
<i>Except there is no safe place</i>

14:12.503 --> 14:14.538
<i>when you're going through withdrawal.</i>

14:14.549 --> 14:16.097
<i>the smaller gazelle.</i>

14:16.107 --> 14:18.099
<i>He makes his approach.</i>

14:18.109 --> 14:20.668
<i>And now, the hunt is on.</i>

14:22.213 --> 14:23.771
<i>Ohh. I have a corn.</i>

14:23.781 --> 14:26.107
It really hurts.

14:26.117 --> 14:27.917
Do you see anything?

14:33.257 --> 14:36.517
You look like hell.

14:36.527 --> 14:38.427
I'm starving.

14:40.231 --> 14:41.797
I don't have any cereal.

14:44.602 --> 14:46.594
Cereal?

14:46.604 --> 14:48.296
I'm a damn animal.

14:48.306 --> 14:51.232
I eat meat, Plum.

14:51.242 --> 14:53.367
Where the hell's the real food?

14:53.377 --> 14:55.970
- That is my <i> real</i> food.
- No it's not.

14:55.980 --> 14:58.406
You ever been to Mauritania?

14:58.416 --> 15:00.608
Isn't that in West Africa?

15:00.618 --> 15:03.911
Men in Mauritania
love big women so much.

15:03.921 --> 15:07.081
In fact, they encourage girls to eat.
It's called <i> leblouh.</i>

15:07.091 --> 15:08.783
I think they force-feed those girls

15:08.793 --> 15:10.585
so that men want to marry them.

15:10.595 --> 15:12.286
Those girls are tortured.

15:12.296 --> 15:14.055
They eat their own vomit.

15:14.065 --> 15:17.225
Well, there's no winnin' for the ladies.

15:17.235 --> 15:19.994
Remember that song "Been A Son"?

15:20.004 --> 15:21.262
Yeah, Nirvana.

15:21.272 --> 15:23.564
You know, Cobain was a feminist.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.433
Frank L. Baum, too.

15:25.443 --> 15:28.569
Trivia. Tigers love it.

15:31.949 --> 15:33.941
Things are no picnic
for you guys, either.

15:33.951 --> 15:36.511
People hunt you, skin you,

15:36.521 --> 15:38.980
hang you on their walls.

15:38.990 --> 15:42.950
I mean, not me, per Se,
but it's a fair point.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.619
You got any lemon?

15:47.498 --> 15:49.865
How can you not know Nirvana?

15:51.602 --> 15:54.095
Hang on. What?

15:54.105 --> 15:56.130
Water's gone...

15:56.140 --> 15:57.698
but I'm still thirsty.

15:57.708 --> 15:59.634
You drank all the water in New York?

15:59.644 --> 16:00.835
Kinda.

16:00.845 --> 16:02.370
That's impossible.

16:05.449 --> 16:08.442
You know, you smell delicious.

16:08.452 --> 16:11.546
Slow your roll, Big T.
I'm not on the menu.

16:11.556 --> 16:13.681
- Should we order in?
- Yeah.

16:13.691 --> 16:15.950
What do you want?

16:15.960 --> 16:18.119
I want a big,

16:18.129 --> 16:20.521
juicy...

16:20.531 --> 16:22.189
corned beef sandwich,

16:22.199 --> 16:24.358
five pepperoni pizzas, extra cheese,

16:24.368 --> 16:26.827
lobster rolls, a tub of
artisanal cookie dough,

16:26.837 --> 16:29.138
and two liters of Coke. Regular Coke.

16:32.176 --> 16:33.976
It'll be here in 41 minutes.

16:38.716 --> 16:40.816
So what do you wanna do now?

16:42.486 --> 16:45.546
I have to work.

16:45.556 --> 16:47.315
You're a writer.

16:47.325 --> 16:50.318
Why aren't you working
on something more muscular?

16:50.328 --> 16:52.820
I was. I am.

16:52.830 --> 16:55.656
This is my real job, and I'm way behind.

16:55.666 --> 16:57.558
You look exhausted.

16:57.568 --> 16:59.760
Why don't you let me
take over for a while?

16:59.770 --> 17:01.362
Come on.

17:01.372 --> 17:03.230
There you go.

17:03.240 --> 17:07.535
See, tigers are intuitives.
We give excellent advice.

17:07.545 --> 17:09.036
You're the best.

17:26.585 --> 17:27.810
<i>Back in the jungle,</i>

17:27.819 --> 17:29.564
<i>things were just swell.</i>

17:29.582 --> 17:32.783
- It's nice, isn't it?
- Maybe.

17:35.202 --> 17:38.696
I don't think I want to feel
anything until I'm Alicia.

17:38.706 --> 17:40.706
But feelings are great.

17:42.677 --> 17:44.001
Like how?

17:44.011 --> 17:46.404
Can you be more specific?

17:51.919 --> 17:54.011
- You promised.
- I'm sorry.

17:54.021 --> 17:55.854
I didn't know it was on.

17:59.560 --> 18:02.127
Can you tell me more about feelings?

18:06.467 --> 18:08.092
Well...

18:08.102 --> 18:10.961
when I'm on the hunt,

18:10.971 --> 18:14.432
every fiber of my body vibrates.

18:14.442 --> 18:17.535
My mind is quiet, but alert.

18:17.545 --> 18:21.539
And my eyes go from brown...

18:21.549 --> 18:23.808
to green.

18:23.818 --> 18:27.144
- That's <i> awesome.</i>
- Yeah.

18:27.154 --> 18:29.755
It's second only to mating.

18:32.159 --> 18:34.452
These eyes of yours, Plum...

18:34.462 --> 18:37.996
You don't have a little
tiger in you, do you?

18:40.134 --> 18:42.460
I don't think so.

18:42.470 --> 18:45.104
You want some?

19:08.763 --> 19:11.288
Hey. What's with the daffodils?

19:11.298 --> 19:12.757
<i>So does anyone know</i>

19:12.767 --> 19:14.358
if we paid Malleck's legal fees?

19:14.368 --> 19:16.160
That better be hot. Anything else?

19:16.170 --> 19:17.762
The florist can't find enough daisies

19:17.772 --> 19:19.296
to spell out "Daisy Chain."

19:19.306 --> 19:21.532
Is it OK if she tastefully
mixes in daffodils?

19:21.542 --> 19:23.221
It is not. What else?

19:23.232 --> 19:25.471
The printer asked if you
wanted to crop Malleck's name

19:25.482 --> 19:28.105
out of his photographs or reprint
them the same size without...

19:28.115 --> 19:30.508
Hold, please. What were <i> you</i>
going to say?

19:30.518 --> 19:32.510
Oh, uh, as far as we can tell,

19:32.520 --> 19:34.879
the information about Austen
and Malleck wasn't leaked.

19:34.889 --> 19:37.681
As far as I can tell,
that's not very reassuring.

19:37.691 --> 19:40.684
Can you give me a percentage?

19:40.694 --> 19:43.362
Like eighty-three percent.

19:45.065 --> 19:46.724
Good enough.

19:46.734 --> 19:49.894
Why the hell were you using
Malleck's photographs?

19:49.904 --> 19:52.463
I didn't. You said... I thought that...

19:52.473 --> 19:55.299
No one but me thinks.
That's exactly the problem.

19:55.309 --> 19:57.968
I want the same theme,
the same color scheme,

19:57.978 --> 20:01.205
only use photographs
taken by diverse <i> women.</i>

20:01.215 --> 20:03.374
- OK, but we don't have any...
- We're done.

20:03.384 --> 20:04.508
Thank you.

20:04.518 --> 20:07.812
What about Plum? She useful?

20:07.822 --> 20:11.182
Well, she lied to me about knowing a
beauty closet intern named Leeta.

20:11.192 --> 20:13.884
Leeta ghosted after the last hack.

20:13.894 --> 20:16.520
Could be coincidence. I'm telling you,

20:16.530 --> 20:18.923
Plum is the one with a <i> giant</i> red flag.

20:18.933 --> 20:20.558
I even gave her a special assignment

20:20.568 --> 20:23.494
so she didn't suspect
that we had our eye on her.

20:23.504 --> 20:26.397
I'm doing my bit. You do yours.

20:26.407 --> 20:29.033
OK, yes, Plum technically had access,

20:29.043 --> 20:30.774
but I been spending
a lot of time with her,

20:30.785 --> 20:32.272
and she does not fit the profile.

20:32.283 --> 20:34.980
Wrong. She absolutely does.

20:36.620 --> 20:39.816
Her answers to my Kitty letters
have gotten a little...

20:40.187 --> 20:42.079
political recently.

20:42.089 --> 20:45.416
I shouldn't have let it slide,
but I liked sounding worldly.

20:45.426 --> 20:47.618
I'm lost.

20:47.628 --> 20:51.789
Large girls pretend
to be joyful and harmless...

20:51.799 --> 20:55.092
but really, they're jealous
of people like me.

20:55.102 --> 20:58.262
No matter how well you
treat them, they fester.

20:58.272 --> 21:00.364
Understood. I'll stay on her.

21:00.374 --> 21:02.855
So what do I need to know
about these Runway Murders?

21:02.866 --> 21:04.561
Besides Malleck and the soccer players,

21:04.572 --> 21:07.438
they ID'd a lawyer,
some artsy film director,

21:07.448 --> 21:10.616
a pro football player,
and that guy Hal Jizz.

21:12.953 --> 21:14.945
He created those websites...

21:14.955 --> 21:18.415
RevengeHer, VietCooch.

21:18.425 --> 21:21.085
God. He sounds foul.

21:21.095 --> 21:22.753
Are we safe?

21:22.763 --> 21:24.083
Look, the feds are all over this,

21:24.094 --> 21:26.208
but my guys on the squad, they're
saying no one knows who Jennifer is...

21:26.219 --> 21:28.325
Why do I get a novella
when all I want is an answer?

21:28.335 --> 21:30.208
Are. We. Safe.

21:30.219 --> 21:32.629
You're probably OK to keep
working on this thing here...

21:32.640 --> 21:35.466
<i>Probably?</i> I took a risk hiring you.

21:35.476 --> 21:38.602
This isn't the time to be lazy and coy.

21:38.612 --> 21:40.070
OK, the way I see it,

21:40.080 --> 21:42.439
whoever orchestrated something this big

21:42.449 --> 21:46.477
is not wasting their time
hacking into Austen's computers.

21:46.487 --> 21:50.180
They're extremists targeting men.

21:52.660 --> 21:54.485
<i>It had been a wild night,</i>

21:54.495 --> 21:57.755
<i>but I was feeling more like myself.</i>

21:57.765 --> 21:59.164
<i>Or not.</i>

22:19.653 --> 22:22.454
Tiger time. Brave like that.

22:25.859 --> 22:27.551
Brave like that.

22:30.464 --> 22:31.797
<i>Brave like that.</i>

23:20.781 --> 23:23.915
Brave like that.

23:25.252 --> 23:28.012
Brave like that.

23:28.022 --> 23:30.589
Brave like that.

23:31.692 --> 23:33.225
Brave like that.

23:45.248 --> 23:47.698
Hello? 911 over here.

23:47.709 --> 23:49.676
Plum? What's wrong?

23:49.686 --> 23:52.479
I think I'm allergic to tiger fur.

23:52.489 --> 23:54.314
- Look at my cheeks.
- Your cheeks?

23:54.324 --> 23:55.548
Whatever. I had this epiphany,

23:55.558 --> 23:57.417
and I needed to tell you about it.

23:57.427 --> 24:00.386
I think that this job
is not good for me.

24:01.898 --> 24:04.090
So I'm covering a fashion show, right?

24:04.100 --> 24:06.059
But I'm not invited to the fashion show.

24:06.069 --> 24:08.428
So, you know, why do I not
want a man to touch me?

24:08.438 --> 24:10.230
Because even if I could accept my...

24:10.240 --> 24:12.332
Please... and if I wanted
to go to a fashion show,

24:12.342 --> 24:15.068
- Plum, did you take something?
- Do you think Kitty cares?

24:15.078 --> 24:16.836
Do you think she respects me or my...

24:16.846 --> 24:20.673
Dear... did you take something?

24:20.683 --> 24:23.910
No. That's the point.

24:23.920 --> 24:25.920
I'm not taking anything.

24:27.357 --> 24:30.216
Calliope House. Shit.

24:30.226 --> 24:33.219
Is Verena having you wean
off pharmaceuticals?

24:33.229 --> 24:34.787
Yeah. Why?

24:34.797 --> 24:37.023
She told me not to go cold turkey,

24:37.033 --> 24:39.893
but I thought, how bad
could it possibly be?

24:39.903 --> 24:42.228
Bad. Super bad.

24:42.238 --> 24:45.064
Look at my skin.

24:45.074 --> 24:47.634
Pretty Plum, I wish
I could stay with you,

24:47.644 --> 24:51.271
but I can't miss that damn,
stupid Daisy Chain party.

24:51.281 --> 24:54.073
I'll have the car drop you at home,

24:54.083 --> 24:57.143
but first I want you to call
a friend to be with you, OK?

24:57.153 --> 24:58.945
Oh, my battery's dead.

24:58.955 --> 25:01.047
Benny was on Spotify
when we were making out.

25:01.057 --> 25:03.149
- Benny?
- The tiger.

25:03.159 --> 25:04.984
That's how I got this rash.

25:04.994 --> 25:08.721
Maybe I could just stay here with Leeta.
She's my friend.

25:08.731 --> 25:10.323
Leeta quit.

25:10.333 --> 25:12.325
New York wasn't for her.

25:12.335 --> 25:14.494
It's hard to keep good interns.

25:14.504 --> 25:17.330
How come you didn't tell Dominic?

25:17.340 --> 25:21.267
The detective? I did.

25:21.277 --> 25:24.137
He called and asked for her.
I was <i> very</i> clear.

25:24.147 --> 25:26.105
He doesn't believe you.

25:26.115 --> 25:28.074
Oh? What did he say?

25:28.084 --> 25:29.742
I miss Leeta.

25:29.752 --> 25:32.779
Do you think she misses me?

25:32.789 --> 25:35.448
I wonder if she was in love with me.

25:35.458 --> 25:37.684
She said I was special, which is funny,

25:37.695 --> 25:40.702
but does it mean that she <i> likes
me</i> likes me, the way that you do?

25:45.301 --> 25:47.994
It's lavender oil. Inhale.

25:50.873 --> 25:52.966
- That's nice.
- Mm-hmm.

25:52.976 --> 25:55.376
Let's get you home.

26:03.720 --> 26:07.313
<i> So while I headed home</i>
<i>to lounge in my PJs,</i>

26:07.323 --> 26:09.449
<i>all the women of Austen Media</i>

26:09.459 --> 26:11.317
<i>were stuffing themselves into Spandex</i>

26:11.327 --> 26:13.720
<i>and smiling their way through
Fashion Week.</i>

26:20.403 --> 26:21.728
You look well, Abra.

26:21.738 --> 26:23.129
Did you sleep the whole plane ride?

26:23.139 --> 26:24.697
Ohh. Not a wink.

26:24.707 --> 26:26.699
But I had to get out of the house.

26:26.709 --> 26:28.735
Stanley was being unbearable.

26:28.745 --> 26:32.338
And then our plane got re-routed
<i>twice</i> because of the murders.

26:32.348 --> 26:35.541
You know, nobody even
called him about Malleck.

26:35.551 --> 26:37.877
Maybe the police didn't know
how close they were.

26:37.887 --> 26:40.513
Ha! Stanley <i> despised</i> Malleck.

26:40.523 --> 26:42.682
He just hates being the last to know.

26:42.692 --> 26:44.517
Somebody should have called, that's all.

26:44.527 --> 26:48.254
Did you consider canceling
the party tonight?

26:48.264 --> 26:50.089
You know, for fear that Austen Media

26:50.099 --> 26:51.758
might come across as tone-deaf?

26:51.768 --> 26:53.226
I did consider it.

26:53.236 --> 26:55.762
But that's what the terrorists want.

26:55.772 --> 26:58.765
To scare us. To destroy our way of life.

26:58.775 --> 27:02.568
We can't let them win, can we?

27:02.578 --> 27:04.679
You know, it's strange,
I was just thinking

27:04.690 --> 27:06.571
about Malleck when we were in Dubrovnik.

27:06.582 --> 27:10.043
The women there barely bother to dress.

27:10.053 --> 27:12.586
His kind of hunting ground.

27:14.957 --> 27:18.017
Do you think it's just part of nature

27:18.027 --> 27:22.221
that people want to dominate
and humiliate others?

27:22.231 --> 27:24.457
Mostly men.

27:24.467 --> 27:27.760
It's OK, you can say it.
Just us chickens here.

27:27.770 --> 27:30.463
- Just us old hens.
- We don't show it.

27:30.473 --> 27:32.065
You're goddamn right we don't.

27:32.075 --> 27:34.867
We can't age, or we become invisible.

27:34.877 --> 27:37.603
But men, nobody cares
what they look like,

27:37.613 --> 27:39.539
as long as they have money.

27:39.549 --> 27:42.775
And when they do fail,
so many of them fail <i> up.</i>

27:42.785 --> 27:45.211
Not Malleck.

27:45.221 --> 27:49.882
You know, Kitty, I think
we might like each other.

27:49.892 --> 27:51.992
That could be useful, yes?

27:59.001 --> 28:01.969
Oh God, not another bomb threat.

28:04.065 --> 28:06.979
Party's canceled, ladies. Please get
back in your car and clear the area.

28:06.990 --> 28:08.878
It's my event inside, officer.

28:08.889 --> 28:11.070
Yeah? Well, the mayor's
declared a state of emergency

28:11.081 --> 28:12.932
and canceled Fashion Week
until further notice.

28:12.943 --> 28:14.018
Why would he do that?

28:14.029 --> 28:15.878
Because we got bodies
falling out of the sky.

28:15.889 --> 28:18.444
But if you cancel Fashion Week,
then <i> they</i> win.

28:18.454 --> 28:20.179
Stanley said we should shut it down.

28:20.189 --> 28:21.614
What?!

28:21.624 --> 28:22.849
Why didn't you tell me?

28:22.859 --> 28:24.239
Why did you make me pick you up?

28:24.250 --> 28:25.952
I said I needed to get out of the house.

28:25.962 --> 28:27.687
Time to get movin', ladies.

28:27.697 --> 28:30.825
Officer, I appreciate that
you're trying to follow orders,

28:30.836 --> 28:33.152
- but I really need to get inside.
- Leave or get arrested.

28:33.163 --> 28:35.297
Be smart, like your friend.

28:37.774 --> 28:40.600
- Excuse me.
- I'll just call our corporate counsel...

28:40.610 --> 28:42.835
There you are! I have a car waiting.

28:42.845 --> 28:45.846
Eladio's already speaking
with the mayor's office.

28:49.285 --> 28:50.810
I don't envy Abra.

28:50.820 --> 28:52.278
Being a member of the idle rich

28:52.288 --> 28:54.280
is a fate worse than poverty.

28:54.290 --> 28:57.984
Did you know she graduated
<i>summa</i> from Kellogg?

28:57.994 --> 29:00.186
- You're kidding.
- Not kidding.

29:00.196 --> 29:01.788
She had dozens of offers.

29:01.798 --> 29:05.224
She chose Stanley... And his rules.

29:05.234 --> 29:08.628
Rules? Like what?

29:08.638 --> 29:10.630
He doesn't want his women to work.

29:10.640 --> 29:14.033
Stanley wants them available to...

29:14.043 --> 29:15.902
run the home and suck the dick.

29:15.912 --> 29:19.005
That's why he and Stella
Cross were doomed.

29:19.015 --> 29:23.376
She had no home, so it was <i> all</i> dick.

29:23.386 --> 29:26.245
Stanley and that porn star?

29:26.255 --> 29:28.514
No. Tell me everything.

29:28.524 --> 29:30.183
No. I've already said too much.

29:32.195 --> 29:33.719
That intern of yours.

29:33.729 --> 29:36.430
The Hot Topic reject?

29:38.234 --> 29:40.560
She's a little off, you know?

29:40.570 --> 29:44.263
Well, I encourage eccentricity,

29:44.273 --> 29:47.541
but refuse to tolerate chaos,
so I fired her.

29:48.945 --> 29:50.770
People underestimate you, Julia.

29:50.780 --> 29:53.105
Is that so?

29:53.115 --> 29:56.509
Where they see
a basement-dwelling eccentric,

29:56.519 --> 29:58.077
I see a...

29:58.087 --> 30:01.021
Somebody's taking our picture.

30:06.028 --> 30:07.954
Shit!

30:07.964 --> 30:09.856
Those tabloid scum got us.

30:09.866 --> 30:12.225
No. It's too loud in here.

30:12.235 --> 30:14.093
There's no way he overheard us.

30:14.103 --> 30:16.062
Who cares what he heard? We're <i> eating.</i>

30:16.072 --> 30:18.731
Optics, Julia.

30:18.741 --> 30:20.474
Optics.

30:51.874 --> 30:54.200
I am so proud of you, Plummy.

30:54.210 --> 30:56.802
Who cares what those mean boys say?

30:56.812 --> 30:59.105
You just keep shakin' it, girl.

30:59.115 --> 31:01.974
I will. At this rate,

31:01.984 --> 31:04.944
Kitty's not going
to be alpha cat much longer.

31:04.954 --> 31:07.280
You look great.

31:07.290 --> 31:09.148
Did you bring any meat?

31:09.158 --> 31:11.050
No. You want me to get some?

31:11.060 --> 31:13.486
I want you to stalk the beast

31:13.496 --> 31:16.622
and rip open its flesh before we mate.

31:41.090 --> 31:43.190
<i>I've never been so hot.</i>

31:44.827 --> 31:47.653
Yeah. You're burnin' up.

31:47.663 --> 31:51.691
Mm. But my skin is so soft.

31:51.701 --> 31:53.334
Feel it.

31:54.470 --> 31:55.628
I know, right?

31:55.638 --> 31:58.497
- Hmm?
- It's very soft.

31:58.507 --> 32:02.268
Sensuous. And there's so much of it.

32:02.278 --> 32:05.271
Don't you just wanna get lost in me

32:05.281 --> 32:07.373
and stay there forever?

32:07.383 --> 32:09.542
I think something's burning.

32:09.552 --> 32:12.178
Dominic, how did you get here?

32:12.188 --> 32:14.547
You called me. You remember?

32:14.557 --> 32:17.683
Oh, yeah. And you came.

32:17.693 --> 32:20.527
I'm gonna go check on the stove.

33:17.649 --> 33:20.645
<i>That's Marlowe... Former sitcom star</i>

33:20.656 --> 33:24.067
<i>turned author, activist,
and earth mother.</i>

33:24.078 --> 33:26.170
I never wanted children.

33:26.180 --> 33:27.805
But you have so many.

33:27.815 --> 33:30.108
How's your newest?

33:30.118 --> 33:32.677
I don't know if she's ready for this.

33:32.687 --> 33:34.579
I just want to be careful.

33:34.589 --> 33:36.414
I... I...

33:36.424 --> 33:39.484
I think Plum is one who could
go in the wrong direction.

33:39.494 --> 33:43.788
She's so bright, but she's impulsive.

33:43.798 --> 33:47.425
What'd she do, drop a few
bastards out of a plane, or...

33:47.435 --> 33:50.995
<i>There were over 3 million hits
on VietCooch.</i>

33:51.005 --> 33:53.131
<i>None of the Vietnamese girls were aware</i>

33:53.141 --> 33:55.767
<i>they were being live-streamed.</i>

33:55.777 --> 33:58.336
<i>My name is Hal Jizz...</i>

33:58.346 --> 34:00.171
<i>and I deserve to die.</i>

34:00.181 --> 34:03.141
<i>We lied under oath and
claimed she was a prostitute</i>

34:03.151 --> 34:05.343
<i>who said she was 19.</i>

34:05.353 --> 34:06.544
<i>We knew she was 13.</i>

34:13.995 --> 34:16.219
<i>My name is Malleck F-Ferguson.</i>

34:16.230 --> 34:19.724
<i>I drugged and sexually
assaulted 31 women and girls,</i>

34:19.734 --> 34:22.694
<i>some as... as young as...</i>

34:22.704 --> 34:24.362
<i>As young as 14.</i>

34:24.371 --> 34:26.496
<i>I denied committing these crimes</i>

34:26.507 --> 34:28.232
<i>and hired lawyers</i>

34:28.242 --> 34:30.234
<i>to intimidate and harass my victims.</i>

34:30.244 --> 34:32.969
<i>My name is Malleck Ferguson
and I deserve to die.</i>

34:32.980 --> 34:35.072
<i>In a UNN exclusive,</i>

34:35.083 --> 34:36.841
<i>Jennifer claimed responsibility</i>

34:36.851 --> 34:39.143
<i>for killing 12 men
they call the Dirty Dozen.</i>

34:39.152 --> 34:40.545
<i>They wanted me to make clear</i>

34:40.554 --> 34:43.585
<i>that they chose Fashion Week to
deliver their protest message</i>

34:43.597 --> 34:45.716
because, and I quote,

34:45.726 --> 34:48.351
"The fashion industry dehumanizes women

34:48.362 --> 34:50.221
and fosters rape culture."

34:50.231 --> 34:51.989
<i>The question</i>

34:51.998 --> 34:55.525
is not longer who is Jennifer,

34:55.536 --> 34:58.663
but <i> what</i> is Jennifer?

34:58.673 --> 35:00.598
You don't feel good, Plum?

35:00.608 --> 35:02.066
I was sick.

35:02.076 --> 35:04.235
I'm just tired now.

35:04.245 --> 35:06.104
Seven-fifty, please.

35:06.114 --> 35:07.179
Nice.

35:09.183 --> 35:10.894
You're in such good shape.

35:11.519 --> 35:13.169
What do you do to keep
such a nice shape?

35:13.209 --> 35:14.433
Leave her alone.

35:15.709 --> 35:18.616
You want me to leave you alone, you
probably shouldn't dress like that.

35:18.633 --> 35:20.596
- Your ass is hangin' out.
- Got you on video.

35:25.700 --> 35:28.090
Mind your own business, cow.
No one's lookin' at you.

35:28.101 --> 35:30.450
- Look who's talking, jerk!
- Crawl back under your rock!

35:30.605 --> 35:33.564
He was here last week doing the
same thing. This has to stop.

35:33.574 --> 35:36.234
- It's not OK.
- Jerk.

35:36.244 --> 35:38.870
I just can't decide

35:38.880 --> 35:41.873
do I call Stanley or text Abra?

35:41.883 --> 35:44.442
If Jennifer would threaten anyone at UNN

35:44.452 --> 35:46.878
or Austen Media, you know
I would have called you.

35:46.888 --> 35:48.746
<i>And</i> the police.

35:48.756 --> 35:50.414
Unless it made a better story not to.

35:50.424 --> 35:52.825
Please don't.

35:55.062 --> 35:57.221
Fine. Have me fired.

35:57.231 --> 35:59.657
Have Stanley shut down
the whole station.

35:59.667 --> 36:01.125
Jeremiah, it's Ms. Montgomery.

36:01.135 --> 36:02.960
Please wake Stanley for me.

36:02.970 --> 36:05.237
- There's...
- I'm sorry.

36:06.440 --> 36:09.241
I was wrong. OK?

36:14.982 --> 36:17.108
Excuse me, false alarm.

36:17.118 --> 36:19.485
Tell Stanley we can speak tomorrow.

36:21.189 --> 36:23.022
I want your source.

36:25.960 --> 36:27.952
Kitty, if... if I do that...

36:27.962 --> 36:30.288
You might save thousands of lives.

36:30.298 --> 36:33.758
Jennifer's done. It's old news already.

36:33.768 --> 36:35.860
Oh, really?

36:35.870 --> 36:38.529
Jennifer will be yesterday
before tomorrow.

36:38.539 --> 36:40.698
Nothing ever sticks anymore.

36:40.708 --> 36:42.834
You get five minutes of outrage,

36:42.844 --> 36:44.202
three minutes of fear,

36:44.212 --> 36:45.870
and then everyone switches over

36:45.880 --> 36:47.939
to some cute goat video

36:47.949 --> 36:49.996
and it's "What were we talking about?"

36:51.019 --> 36:52.677
Jennifer's different.

36:52.687 --> 36:54.879
Mark my words.

36:54.889 --> 36:57.215
They won't stop until

36:57.225 --> 36:59.684
they believe they've freed
women from oppression

36:59.694 --> 37:00.893
once and for all.

37:02.396 --> 37:04.355
And that's never gonna happen.

37:04.365 --> 37:07.733
Men would rather destroy the
world than let us rule it.

37:15.631 --> 37:17.935
I'm glad you're not a cop anymore, Dad.

37:17.946 --> 37:19.576
It's too dangerous.

37:21.193 --> 37:23.894
She's worried about Jennifer.

37:28.867 --> 37:30.567
So what did you guys see?

37:32.104 --> 37:34.571
See the video of the guys confessing?

37:38.143 --> 37:40.969
What if Jennifer makes a mistake...

37:40.979 --> 37:43.572
and she kills somebody good? Like <i> you.</i>

37:43.582 --> 37:46.375
Nothin' is gonna happen to me.

37:46.385 --> 37:48.143
Do you still have a gun?

37:50.289 --> 37:51.446
Mama!

37:51.456 --> 37:53.382
What are we celebrating?

37:53.392 --> 37:55.592
- I needed a little sugar.
- Mmm.

37:57.229 --> 37:59.596
Mmm. Caramel. Yum.

38:00.799 --> 38:02.791
Go wash up.

38:02.801 --> 38:06.136
Only Harry Potter.
No computer before bed.

38:17.649 --> 38:20.075
- What's wrong?
- I know money's tight,

38:20.085 --> 38:21.677
but I don't like you workin' doubles.

38:21.687 --> 38:24.313
Well, it isn't forever, baby.

38:24.323 --> 38:26.356
I'm better when I'm busy.

38:27.826 --> 38:30.160
It charges me up. Ya know?

38:45.310 --> 38:47.177
What the hell, Nicky?

38:48.973 --> 38:51.068
- I'm sorry.
- What if somebody sees it?

38:51.079 --> 38:53.580
These women won't open up to you
if they think you're married.

38:53.591 --> 38:57.946
You know I'm superstitious.
You're right. I'm sorry.

38:57.956 --> 39:00.373
How come you always
make me feel like a bully?

39:00.384 --> 39:02.350
Marissa, can we not do this tonight?

39:06.939 --> 39:08.072
Whatever.

39:15.796 --> 39:19.056
So... how's the case going?

39:19.066 --> 39:23.160
It's good. I might have
found an informant.

39:23.170 --> 39:26.096
Yeah? What's her name?

39:26.106 --> 39:27.998
<i>Her name was Plum.</i>

39:28.008 --> 39:31.068
<i>And while she'd been away
on a quick hallucination,</i>

39:31.078 --> 39:33.671
<i>the whole world seemed
to have lost its mind.</i>

39:35.950 --> 39:38.642
- I'm calling the cops!
<i>- It's us, honey!</i>

39:38.652 --> 39:40.752
<i>Open the door, Plum.</i>

39:42.656 --> 39:45.282
- Mom?
- Ohh!

39:45.292 --> 39:47.751
Oh, thank God you're OK!

39:47.761 --> 39:50.654
- What are you doing here?
- She drove all night from St. Louis.

39:50.664 --> 39:52.690
What were you doing in St. Louis?

39:52.700 --> 39:55.092
My plane was grounded,
then I got a rental.

39:55.102 --> 39:57.528
Steven told me about
your withdrawal drama.

39:57.538 --> 39:59.964
It was the only way
to stop her from calling 911.

39:59.974 --> 40:03.267
- Why?
- The phone calls, baby.

40:03.277 --> 40:05.135
You said you started modeling,

40:05.145 --> 40:07.471
that Benny the Bengal Tiger
was a good kisser...

40:07.481 --> 40:09.306
I thought you were
having a psychotic break.

40:09.316 --> 40:10.449
I didn't want you to worry.

40:10.460 --> 40:13.449
- You could have died.
- Please don't exaggerate, Mom.

40:13.460 --> 40:15.878
Shit, shit, shit, shit!

40:15.889 --> 40:18.949
This Verena woman, what's that about?

40:18.959 --> 40:20.951
Who pays somebody that kind of money...

40:20.961 --> 40:23.053
- You told her about Verena.
- Can you blame me?

40:23.063 --> 40:24.722
- This is so typical...
- Enough. Enough.

40:24.732 --> 40:26.357
We all did what we did,

40:26.367 --> 40:28.792
but it sounds like you're
joining a cult or something.

40:28.802 --> 40:30.527
- I mean...
- Damnit!

40:30.537 --> 40:31.974
What kind of therapist bribes you

40:31.985 --> 40:34.339
and then forces you to go off
doctor-prescribed medication?

40:34.350 --> 40:36.699
She didn't! Verena wanted
me to get <i> more</i> pills.

40:36.710 --> 40:38.849
- She feels guilty because her mother was...
- Steven told me.

40:38.860 --> 40:39.931
That's not the point.

40:39.942 --> 40:41.904
You shouldn't be getting
the surgery anyway.

40:41.915 --> 40:44.975
There's no reason to let Verena
torture you for money.

40:44.985 --> 40:46.644
You're beautiful the way you are,

40:46.654 --> 40:48.646
and you have a good life, Plum.

40:48.656 --> 40:50.914
Things at work are finally
starting to work out...

40:50.924 --> 40:53.158
Stop. Just stop. Please.

40:55.095 --> 40:58.255
I get it. You love me, you were scared.

40:58.265 --> 41:00.991
I get it, I'm sorry.
But I'm not a child.

41:01.001 --> 41:03.093
And I'm not a moron.

41:03.103 --> 41:05.062
We don't think that.

41:05.072 --> 41:07.398
I don't want to be a glamazon.

41:07.408 --> 41:09.166
I just want to get on an airplane

41:09.176 --> 41:11.902
and not have to apologize
to the person I sit next to.

41:11.912 --> 41:15.039
I want to go to a bar and get
hit on by some bald guy,

41:15.049 --> 41:18.509
and I want us to argue about whether
said bald guy is actually into me

41:18.519 --> 41:20.177
or whether he just wants to get laid.

41:20.187 --> 41:23.447
- I know.
- You don't, Steven!

41:23.457 --> 41:24.890
You can't!

41:31.532 --> 41:33.724
Going off Y, I got my feelings back,

41:33.734 --> 41:35.793
and it made me remember why
I wanted 'em gone.

41:35.803 --> 41:37.361
Don't say that, honey.

41:37.371 --> 41:40.130
No, no. What I realized was,

41:40.140 --> 41:44.068
I don't hate myself...
The <i> world</i> hates me.

41:44.078 --> 41:45.703
For being like this.

41:45.713 --> 41:48.072
Every day I walk around in this skin,

41:48.082 --> 41:50.441
people look at me
like I have the plague.

41:50.451 --> 41:52.417
They act like I'm a <i> stain.</i>

41:53.487 --> 41:56.714
They stare and laugh and yell,

41:56.724 --> 42:00.884
and worst of all, they tell me
I have such a pretty face...

42:00.894 --> 42:03.954
and then they lecture me
on how I can fix my body,

42:03.964 --> 42:05.823
because how I am is wrong.

42:05.833 --> 42:08.158
- That's not true.
- It <i> is</i> true.

42:08.168 --> 42:10.602
You can't see it because you love me.

42:12.106 --> 42:14.072
But if this is it,

42:14.091 --> 42:16.417
if this is my life,

42:16.428 --> 42:18.666
if this is my body...

42:19.246 --> 42:21.279
I'd rather be dead.
