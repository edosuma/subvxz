00:02.902 --> 00:04.003
{\an5}(Nina Parker)
Coming up on "Love &amp; Hip Hop:
The Reunion"...

00:04.070 --> 00:05.205
Give it to us.

00:05.271 --> 00:06.439
It's the triumphant return
of the OGs

00:06.506 --> 00:08.708
and the cast is ready to get it.

00:08.775 --> 00:10.377
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the stage...

00:10.443 --> 00:11.644
{\an1}Watch your tone,
you bitch-ass (bleep).

00:11.711 --> 00:13.413
(Nina)
Motives will be questioned...

00:13.480 --> 00:15.915
{\an5}What do you mean,
you hope I'm doing it
for the right reasons?

00:15.982 --> 00:17.117
Honestly...

00:17.183 --> 00:18.685
(Nina)
...patience will be tested...

00:18.752 --> 00:20.620
Y'all need to stop barking up
the wrong mother(bleep) tree

00:20.687 --> 00:21.921
and go with the Chihuahuas

00:21.988 --> 00:23.690
and stop coming
to my (bleep).

00:23.757 --> 00:26.259
I'm a grown-ass
mother(bleep) bitch.

00:26.326 --> 00:28.094
(Nina)
...and bombs will be dropped...

00:28.161 --> 00:30.363
There also have been
talking about a baby.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.631
Can you guys fill me in?

00:31.698 --> 00:32.698
I love Rich very much.

00:32.766 --> 00:33.900
That's not
what happened!

00:33.967 --> 00:35.034
(Nina)
...leaving some speechless...

00:35.101 --> 00:36.436
{\an1}(bleep).

00:36.503 --> 00:38.438
Say something, please.

00:38.505 --> 00:40.573
♪ En-entertain
ta-ta-ta ♪

00:40.640 --> 00:42.809
{\an5}(Nina)
...and others ready
to spring into action.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.310
{\an1}They gonna dog-walk
your ass, bitch.

00:44.377 --> 00:47.013
{\an1}This bitch is ten feet tall
like a Jolly Green Giant.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.749
{\an5}Yo, yo, yo, yo...

00:47.080 --> 00:49.749
(screaming)

00:49.816 --> 00:52.886
{\an8}(Nina)
And tonight on part one
of "The Reunion"...

00:52.952 --> 00:54.254
{\an8}(man)
Get ready to go here.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.157
{\an8}"Love &amp; Hip Hop: New York,
Season 9: Reunion."

00:57.223 --> 00:58.191
{\an8}We here.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.560
{\an8}(overlapping chatter)

01:00.627 --> 01:02.462
{\an8}(Nina)
After becoming the center
of controversy,

01:02.529 --> 01:05.165
{\an8}Safaree is nowhere
to be found.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.666
{\an8}Anyone have eyes on Safaree?

01:06.733 --> 01:08.334
{\an8}Anyone have eyes
on Safaree?

01:08.401 --> 01:10.403
{\an7}He didn't check
into the hotel yesterday.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.572
{\an7}He said he wasn't
gonna come.

01:12.639 --> 01:14.140
{\an7}I'm starting
to believe him.

01:14.207 --> 01:15.942
{\an8}I don't know anything
about Safaree.

01:16.009 --> 01:17.577
{\an8}I'm here and that's
all that matters.

01:17.644 --> 01:18.778
Why do I need to know
where he's at?

01:18.845 --> 01:20.046
It's going
straight to voicemail.

01:20.113 --> 01:22.081
Practicing patience
today.

01:22.148 --> 01:23.116
{\an1}He's not part
of the crew anymore?

01:23.183 --> 01:24.484
{\an8}Straight!

01:24.551 --> 01:27.053
{\an8}♪♪

01:27.120 --> 01:28.354
{\an8}We all grown-ups here,

01:28.421 --> 01:30.023
{\an8}and if he chose not to be here
for the reunion,

01:30.089 --> 01:31.458
{\an8}then God bless him.

01:31.524 --> 01:33.226
Okay, so is Safaree coming?
Am I saying he's here?

01:33.293 --> 01:34.360
Is he not here?

01:34.427 --> 01:36.162
Three, two...

01:36.229 --> 01:37.764
(cheering and applause)

01:37.831 --> 01:41.701
Welcome to "Love &amp; Hip Hop:
Season 9 Reunion."

01:41.768 --> 01:43.369
{\an8}I'm your host, Nina Parker.

01:43.436 --> 01:45.772
{\an8}Now, listen, this season
was all about adulting,

01:45.839 --> 01:47.941
as a few OGs made
their return

01:48.007 --> 01:51.811
and the entire cast dealt
with real-life issues.

01:51.878 --> 01:55.482
A Harlem legend had to take
responsibility for past actions

01:55.548 --> 01:57.951
and deal with the impact
of his absence.

01:58.017 --> 02:01.421
A fiery couple's tale of love
became a coming-of-age story

02:01.488 --> 02:04.624
when it was buttoned up
with a surprise proposal.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.860
Best friends saw
their friendship expire

02:06.926 --> 02:09.461
when one was accused
of holding old grudges

02:09.529 --> 02:11.598
and the other was accused
of chasing clout.

02:11.664 --> 02:14.467
And a "Love &amp; Hip Hop"
power couple provided counsel

02:14.534 --> 02:15.735
on love and relationships

02:15.802 --> 02:18.771
while anxiously preparing
for the arrival

02:18.838 --> 02:20.173
of the Golden Child.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.042
Please help me welcome the cast
of "Love &amp; Hip Hop."

02:23.109 --> 02:25.645
(cheering and applause)

02:25.712 --> 02:26.746
Joe and Cyn.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.581
(cheering and applause)

02:28.648 --> 02:31.384
Juelz and Kimbella.

02:31.451 --> 02:34.754
{\an5}Yandy!

02:31.451 --> 02:34.754
(cheering and applause)

02:34.821 --> 02:36.256
Papoose and Remy.

02:36.322 --> 02:37.824
(loud cheering and applause)

02:37.891 --> 02:40.493
Rich Dollaz.

02:40.560 --> 02:42.929
Maino and Maggie.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.265
{\an5}Juju.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.265
(cheering)

02:45.331 --> 02:48.201
Alexis Skyy.

02:48.268 --> 02:50.870
Nya.

02:50.937 --> 02:52.171
Mariahlynn.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.706
(cheering and applause)

02:53.773 --> 02:56.442
Jonathan.

02:56.509 --> 02:57.844
And Sidney Starr.

02:57.911 --> 03:01.147
(cheering and applause)

03:03.917 --> 03:05.552
Okay, now you guys have
probably noticed

03:05.618 --> 03:08.154
that one of the main
cast members is missing.

03:08.221 --> 03:10.490
For whatever reason,
Safaree has decided

03:10.557 --> 03:11.891
not to join us.

03:11.958 --> 03:13.560
(audience groaning)

03:13.626 --> 03:15.295
Oh...

03:15.361 --> 03:18.031
{\an8}Well, in the absence
of Safaree, straight!

03:18.097 --> 03:19.499
{\an8}Straight!

03:21.301 --> 03:23.069
Rich, no idea why
he might not come?

03:23.136 --> 03:25.171
Isn't that part of being
nonconfrontational?

03:25.238 --> 03:29.842
{\an8}Is that in the moment,
you don't want smoke.

03:29.909 --> 03:31.411
But that's his character trait

03:31.477 --> 03:33.680
{\an1}and once you assess that,
everybody got (bleep) with him.

03:33.746 --> 03:35.582
{\an7}I didn't know that
we really cared

03:35.648 --> 03:36.716
{\an7}that much
that he not here.

03:36.783 --> 03:37.917
{\an7}Maybe he got
something to do.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.218
{\an7}Maybe he hurt his elbow,
like we don't know.

03:39.285 --> 03:41.254
{\an1}Like, you know, maybe
sipping on tea or something.

03:41.321 --> 03:42.555
We don't know, like...

03:42.622 --> 03:44.257
He gotta come
and face his (bleep).

03:44.324 --> 03:47.160
{\an8}Like everybody in here
has gone through (bleeps)

03:47.226 --> 03:49.262
{\an8}and good (bleep),
so he should be here

03:49.329 --> 03:50.830
{\an8}to defend his self,
and that's it.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.131
Yes.

03:52.198 --> 03:54.367
(audience agreeing)

03:54.434 --> 03:56.069
{\an5}Can I end this?

03:54.434 --> 03:56.069
Sure.

03:56.135 --> 03:59.005
{\an8}I think that we should
let people be.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.173
{\an8}Live and let live.

04:00.239 --> 04:01.741
And we shall continue
the reunion.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.142
Right, thank you.

04:03.209 --> 04:04.811
(cheering and applause)

04:04.877 --> 04:06.479
Now, you guys, as always,
we want you

04:06.546 --> 04:08.414
to join the conversation
on social media.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.551
{\an8}So remember to use
#LHHREUNION.

04:11.618 --> 04:13.987
{\an8}And you can chime in about all
the craziness of tonight's show

04:14.053 --> 04:15.955
and even give your thoughts
on Safaree's no-show.

04:16.022 --> 04:17.589
So you guys can be
included as well.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.959
{\an5}Also, head over to
the "Love &amp; Hip Hop"
Instagram story

04:20.026 --> 04:23.196
right now to weigh in on all
of tonight's wildest moments.

04:23.262 --> 04:24.998
And now, before we get
things moving,

04:25.064 --> 04:27.600
I want to talk to the people
who are here.

04:27.667 --> 04:29.602
Now, Kimbella and Juelz,
congratulations.

04:29.669 --> 04:30.803
{\an5}You guys is married now.

04:29.669 --> 04:30.803
{\an3}Thank you.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.839
{\an5}(cheering and applause)

04:30.870 --> 04:32.839
(Nina laughs)

04:32.905 --> 04:34.974
Yes, there's a glow about you,
I wanna say.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.175
You look beautiful.

04:36.242 --> 04:37.744
{\an8}Is it just the bling?

04:37.810 --> 04:39.379
{\an8}I mean, amongst
other things.

04:39.445 --> 04:41.314
(scattered "oh"s)

04:41.381 --> 04:44.250
(Mariahlynn)
Come on, girl. Come on.

04:44.317 --> 04:46.419
{\an5}Give it to us.

04:44.317 --> 04:46.419
(Kimbella giggling)

04:46.486 --> 04:48.955
{\an7}She decided to stop
taking birth control.

04:49.022 --> 04:51.324
(cheering)

04:51.391 --> 04:52.825
{\an1}And you know me,
I'm...

04:52.892 --> 04:55.495
{\an1}My joints
is ready to go.

04:55.561 --> 04:57.463
{\an5}You know what I mean?

04:55.561 --> 04:57.463
Yeah.

04:59.666 --> 05:01.200
{\an5}He...

04:59.666 --> 05:01.200
{\an3}It's a boy?

05:01.267 --> 05:02.902
{\an5}It is...

05:01.267 --> 05:02.902
Oh, my gosh!

05:02.969 --> 05:04.671
You already know what it is?

05:04.737 --> 05:06.673
{\an5}Congratulations.

05:04.737 --> 05:06.673
Thank you.

05:06.739 --> 05:08.541
Keep all positive vibes
for you guys.

05:08.608 --> 05:09.609
{\an3}Thank you.

05:09.676 --> 05:11.210
{\an6}Okay?

05:09.676 --> 05:11.210
Thank you.

05:11.277 --> 05:13.780
So Joe and Cyn,
we haven't seen you guys,

05:13.846 --> 05:15.248
I think it was like
season four.

05:15.314 --> 05:18.184
How was it coming back
this season together

05:18.251 --> 05:19.385
with a new baby?

05:19.452 --> 05:20.820
How was it different
for you?

05:20.887 --> 05:23.156
It was exciting, 'cause
Joe's like my best friend.

05:23.222 --> 05:25.525
But it was also like
really heavy

05:25.591 --> 05:27.360
because of the things
I was dealing with at home

05:27.427 --> 05:29.429
with the baby
and being a new mother.

05:29.495 --> 05:32.565
But Joey is such a great
support system.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.500
So I feel ready
for whatever

05:34.567 --> 05:35.835
with this man
on my side.

05:35.902 --> 05:36.936
(applause)

05:37.003 --> 05:38.504
(Nina)
Okay, okay.

05:38.571 --> 05:40.873
Now, are y'all ready to get
the rest of the show started?

05:40.940 --> 05:43.843
(cheering and applause)

05:43.910 --> 05:46.179
Now, after Yandy opened her home
to become a foster mother,

05:46.245 --> 05:47.747
many wondered
if she had bitten off

05:47.814 --> 05:49.015
more than she could chew.

05:49.082 --> 05:51.451
But Yandy felt she was more
than capable

05:51.517 --> 05:53.019
of dealing
with Infinity's issues,

05:53.086 --> 05:54.687
both now and beyond.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.055
Let's take a look.

05:56.122 --> 05:58.758
{\an8}Infinity is a very special
young lady

05:58.825 --> 06:01.094
{\an8}that I met through
my mentorship program.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.096
{\an8}So I invited her
to stay with me

06:03.162 --> 06:06.632
{\an8}until we got her foster
situation sorted out.

06:06.699 --> 06:09.736
{\an7}If I keep you here,
I could be breaking the law.

06:11.437 --> 06:13.473
{\an8}So, until this is
an approved place

06:13.539 --> 06:15.007
{\an8}for you to be,

06:15.074 --> 06:18.111
{\an8}I might have to bring you
back to your foster home.

06:20.012 --> 06:22.682
So what is the status
of Infinity now?

06:22.749 --> 06:24.450
{\an5}She's still with you?

06:22.749 --> 06:24.450
Absolutely.

06:24.517 --> 06:25.785
I know you're fostering her.

06:25.852 --> 06:27.520
Are you thinking about
adopting her as well?

06:27.587 --> 06:30.156
{\an7}It has not been easy
trying to make this happen.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.091
{\an1}So, when I finally got
in touch with her attorney,

06:32.158 --> 06:34.227
{\an5}he was like,
"We have to have
an emergency court date

06:34.293 --> 06:37.163
"because what you're doing
is very different

06:37.230 --> 06:38.264
than what the rules are."

06:38.331 --> 06:40.466
And Infinity pleaded
for herself.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.001
{\an5}You had spoken to her mother.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.001
{\an3}Yes.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.003
And her mother had a bit of
a different story than she had.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.605
{\an5}Yes, yes.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.605
{\an1}So which--

06:45.671 --> 06:46.773
Did you find that was true?

06:46.839 --> 06:48.040
Did she grow up
in the foster system?

06:48.107 --> 06:50.510
{\an5}Did she not?

06:48.107 --> 06:50.510
I know what the truth is,

06:50.576 --> 06:53.012
and this girl did not ask
to be where she is.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.947
I took her in my home.

06:55.014 --> 06:56.783
{\an1}She did not say,
"Yandy, can I stay with you?

06:56.849 --> 06:58.684
Yandy, can I...?"
This girl needed me.

06:58.751 --> 07:00.353
This girl needed what I had,

07:00.419 --> 07:01.888
and I have an abundance
of stuff

07:01.954 --> 07:03.022
that God has blessed me with.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.091
So I said,
"I'm not letting you

07:05.158 --> 07:08.127
{\an1}do anything but stay right here
until you feel safe."

07:08.194 --> 07:09.962
And I think that is the role

07:10.029 --> 07:11.998
that God put me in
in this young lady's life.

07:12.064 --> 07:13.332
(applause)

07:13.399 --> 07:14.867
(Nina)
Now, Maggie, I know on the show,

07:14.934 --> 07:17.770
I heard you say that you also
were a foster child.

07:17.837 --> 07:19.205
So can you kind of understand

07:19.272 --> 07:20.773
what she was kind of
going through at that moment?

07:20.840 --> 07:24.377
{\an8}It's hard for me
to talk about this stuff.

07:24.443 --> 07:26.579
Infinity, she's amazing.

07:26.646 --> 07:29.081
{\an5}(sobbing)
Like she's an amazing
little girl.

07:29.148 --> 07:32.218
{\an1}And it's so sad to watch...
(sobbing)

07:32.285 --> 07:35.855
to watch all of that stuff
and just think about

07:35.922 --> 07:37.990
an innocent child
having to go through that.

07:38.057 --> 07:40.126
Maggie, stop.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.961
I'm sorry.
I'm like emotional.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.129
No, you're okay.

07:43.196 --> 07:44.730
And she didn't deserve
any of that.

07:44.797 --> 07:46.699
I went through
the same exact thing

07:46.766 --> 07:48.000
Infinity went through,

07:48.067 --> 07:50.536
and I had my friends'
mothers take me in.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.705
{\an4}Mm-hmm.

07:50.603 --> 07:52.705
And I-- I still ran away.

07:52.772 --> 07:54.674
They coulda just threw me
back in the system.

07:54.740 --> 07:57.009
So, for things to be
working out between them

07:57.076 --> 07:59.111
and to see it and to see
how happy she is,

07:59.178 --> 08:00.112
it makes me happy.

08:00.179 --> 08:01.948
(applause)

08:02.014 --> 08:04.116
Now, no good deed
goes unpunished.

08:04.183 --> 08:05.651
But in Yandy's case,

08:05.718 --> 08:07.854
no good deed posted
on social media

08:07.920 --> 08:09.188
goes unscrutinized.

08:09.255 --> 08:11.390
Let's see what happened
when Kim and Mariahlynn

08:11.457 --> 08:13.726
accused her of not doing it
for the love,

08:13.793 --> 08:15.928
but doing it for the Gram.

08:15.995 --> 08:19.232
{\an1}I see on social media
she adopted, um,

08:19.298 --> 08:20.733
a little girl.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.535
{\an1}But is it
for the right reasons?

08:22.602 --> 08:24.904
{\an7}Because she likes to like
portray her, you know,

08:24.971 --> 08:28.174
{\an7}her life to be this
holier than thou.

08:28.241 --> 08:30.176
{\an8}I know her better
than a lot of people.

08:30.243 --> 08:32.378
{\an8}And for sure, listen,

08:32.445 --> 08:33.913
{\an8}she's doing something
for something.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.849
{\an8}I think that you should take
Yandy with a salt of grain.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.251
{\an8}Like I don't think
that you should--

08:38.317 --> 08:39.619
{\an8}You don't like Yandy either?

08:39.684 --> 08:41.419
{\an7}I question whether
the bitch is genuine or not.

08:41.486 --> 08:44.056
{\an8}Between me and you,
we all know

08:44.123 --> 08:47.193
{\an8}Yandy does things for a look,
like taking that child in.

08:47.260 --> 08:48.661
{\an8}That (bleep) is fake
as (bleep).

08:48.728 --> 08:51.130
{\an8}Okay? All right?

08:48.728 --> 08:51.130
{\an8}Mmm.

08:51.197 --> 08:54.333
You had a conversation
about my kids.

08:54.400 --> 08:55.735
{\an1}Let's clarify something,
I've never had

08:55.801 --> 08:56.836
{\an1}a conversation
about your kids.

08:56.903 --> 08:58.337
About Infinity?

08:58.404 --> 09:02.642
{\an8}You didn't tell Mariahlynn
that this whole thing

09:02.708 --> 09:04.176
{\an8}was a paparazzi stunt?

09:02.708 --> 09:04.176
{\an7}No.

09:04.243 --> 09:06.279
{\an8}What I did say was,

09:06.345 --> 09:08.948
{\an7}I hope that you did
foster her

09:09.015 --> 09:10.516
{\an7}for the right reasons,
that's all I said.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.084
{\an8}What the (bleep)
does that mean?

09:12.151 --> 09:13.519
And what it--
what I mean.

09:13.586 --> 09:16.088
(applause)

09:16.155 --> 09:17.924
{\an5}(Nina)
Kimbella, I'm gonna
start with you.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.959
I see you're already
tearing up.

09:20.026 --> 09:21.661
{\an5}It's hormones, you know.

09:20.026 --> 09:21.661
(Nina laughing)

09:21.727 --> 09:24.830
What's the current status
of you and Yandy's friendship?

09:24.897 --> 09:26.032
Lord, where do I begin?

09:26.098 --> 09:28.167
{\an1}Yandy was in my wedding,
and that was because

09:28.234 --> 09:29.835
I felt like we were
in a better place.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.938
{\an1}Today, she feels
as though

09:32.004 --> 09:34.507
I'm speaking on all her kids.

09:34.573 --> 09:38.544
{\an1}And me as a woman,
loving my kids,

09:38.611 --> 09:40.212
not even just my kids,

09:40.279 --> 09:41.681
our kids grew up together.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.549
We had kids together.

09:43.616 --> 09:47.086
So I will never accept
the fact that anybody

09:47.153 --> 09:48.621
(bleep) everybody else.

09:48.688 --> 09:50.790
{\an1}Especially her
to feel like

09:50.856 --> 09:52.992
{\an1}I'm speaking
on her children.

09:53.059 --> 09:56.495
{\an1}I hated that I had
to resee that scene.

09:56.562 --> 09:57.763
And I'm sure for you, too.

09:57.830 --> 09:59.999
But I felt like we spoke
about it in Costa Rica.

10:01.634 --> 10:04.904
{\an1}All these things conjured up
because I'm angry.

10:04.971 --> 10:06.138
I'm upset at you.

10:06.205 --> 10:08.174
And I do wanna
apologize to you.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.345
{\an1}I told you exactly
what I said, but then--

10:12.411 --> 10:14.180
{\an5}No, you didn't, Kim.

10:12.411 --> 10:14.180
{\an1}I didn't even know
she was upset

10:14.246 --> 10:16.949
{\an1}until I text her five days
after the episode aired.

10:17.016 --> 10:19.352
{\an4}She never called me.
She never text me.

10:17.016 --> 10:19.352
I did, yes.

10:19.418 --> 10:21.721
{\an1}So I'm thinking, all right,
so now I see you have a problem.

10:21.787 --> 10:23.422
{\an1}Why didn't you call me
and let me know

10:23.489 --> 10:24.757
{\an1}that you're feeling
this type of way?

10:24.824 --> 10:27.126
So, Yandy, where did it
go left for you?

10:27.193 --> 10:28.728
Because you were
in the wedding.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.496
{\an5}You guys hashed it out.
We thought you were okay.

10:28.794 --> 10:30.496
{\an3}Yeah.

10:30.563 --> 10:33.332
Now, you saw it and you feel
like you saw a different story?

10:33.399 --> 10:36.736
{\an1}So, in Costa Rica,
I said, "I just wanna know.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.437
Did you speak on my child?"

10:38.504 --> 10:40.506
She said,
"I hope you're doing this

10:40.573 --> 10:41.807
for the right reason."
I was offended.

10:41.874 --> 10:44.377
'Cause like I said,
what do you mean,

10:44.443 --> 10:46.178
you hope I'm doing it
for the right reasons?

10:46.245 --> 10:47.480
I was offended
with just that.

10:47.546 --> 10:49.882
The minute somebody
mentions any child,

10:49.949 --> 10:52.251
{\an1}what you say is,
"I don't speak on children."

10:52.318 --> 10:54.020
Period.
Kids are off-limits.

10:54.086 --> 10:55.621
I don't care about
nothing we do,

10:55.688 --> 10:57.323
this TV (bleep),
people get extra for TV.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.859
{\an1}I've done it. I've done
a lot of (bleep) in my life.

10:59.925 --> 11:02.661
{\an1}I done a lot of mother(bleep)
great (bleep).

11:02.728 --> 11:04.830
But one thing I do
the best in my life

11:04.897 --> 11:06.298
is be a mother(bleep)
mother.

11:06.365 --> 11:09.301
(cheering and applause)

11:12.038 --> 11:15.941
And if you sit across
from somebody and say,

11:16.008 --> 11:18.344
me bringing a human being
into my house

11:18.411 --> 11:20.379
is fake as (bleep),

11:20.446 --> 11:23.182
{\an1}you disrespecting my mothering
to my (bleep) kid.

11:23.249 --> 11:24.750
That's not what happened!

11:24.817 --> 11:26.385
And you not gonna
insinuate

11:26.452 --> 11:29.188
that I will ever speak
on any child, period!

11:29.255 --> 11:31.424
{\an1}(Juelz)
She spoke about you,

11:31.490 --> 11:33.626
{\an1}and it was wrong
what she said,

11:33.692 --> 11:35.661
{\an1}but she did not
speak about Infinity.

11:35.728 --> 11:37.029
Did y'all see what I saw?

11:37.096 --> 11:38.164
(women)
Yeah, yeah.

11:38.230 --> 11:39.298
Did anybody here see
somebody say--

11:39.365 --> 11:40.599
We all see what you said.

11:40.666 --> 11:42.568
{\an5}I-- I (bleep)...

11:40.666 --> 11:42.568
Did anybody?

11:42.635 --> 11:44.170
Clap if you heard her say...

11:44.236 --> 11:45.871
(overlapping shouting)

11:45.938 --> 11:48.574
(Yandy)
I'm not buggin'.

11:48.641 --> 11:49.875
{\an1}(Kimbella)
Now you the victim.

11:49.942 --> 11:51.744
No, I'm not a victim.
Stop saying that.

11:51.811 --> 11:54.346
Know that this is
a 16-year-old girl

11:54.413 --> 11:57.383
that has to sit there
and possibly be bullied

11:57.450 --> 11:59.952
{\an5}by people saying,
"Oh, your mother
don't really want you.

12:00.019 --> 12:01.487
She doing it
for Instagram."

12:01.554 --> 12:03.722
When I've come to your house
3:00 in the morning for you,

12:03.789 --> 12:05.024
did I put it on Instagram?

12:05.091 --> 12:06.926
When I opened my doors
for you and my kids,

12:06.992 --> 12:09.028
{\an5}was that on Instagram?

12:06.992 --> 12:09.028
What are you talking about?

12:09.095 --> 12:10.830
{\an1}When I sat in the hospital
with you for different things,

12:10.896 --> 12:12.665
{\an5}was that on Instagram?

12:10.896 --> 12:12.665
The same thing for you!

12:12.731 --> 12:14.166
{\an5}Don't talk about Instagram.

12:12.731 --> 12:14.166
What about...

12:14.233 --> 12:15.401
(bleep) on Instagram
that got to do with you.

12:15.468 --> 12:16.702
{\an1}I would never do that
to you...

12:16.769 --> 12:20.239
(overlapping shouting
and bleeps)

12:20.306 --> 12:21.474
{\an5}Exactly, exactly.

12:20.306 --> 12:21.474
And I've never...

12:21.540 --> 12:23.709
Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Y'all doing this too much.

12:23.776 --> 12:26.579
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,
yo, yo, yo, yo.

12:26.645 --> 12:29.748
{\an8}There also have been blogs
talking about a baby.

12:29.815 --> 12:31.250
{\an8}Can you guys fill me in?

12:29.815 --> 12:31.250
{\an7}What?

12:31.317 --> 12:32.785
{\an8}(woman)
Huh? What?

12:32.852 --> 12:34.286
{\an7}Mother(bleep), I don't
(bleep) about you.

12:34.353 --> 12:35.588
{\an7}They gonna dog-walk
your ass, bitch,

12:35.654 --> 12:37.556
{\an7}so you gotta get
broken at home first.

12:37.623 --> 12:38.924
{\an8}You can sit here,
yell, curse,

12:38.991 --> 12:40.092
{\an8}and do all that (bleep)
that you want.

12:40.159 --> 12:41.494
{\an8}(audience "whoo"ing)

12:47.133 --> 12:48.434
{\an8}Exactly, exactly.

12:47.133 --> 12:48.434
{\an8}And I've never...

12:48.501 --> 12:50.736
{\an8}Yo, yo, yo, yo.
Y'all doing this too much.

12:50.803 --> 12:53.506
{\an8}Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo,
yo, yo, yo, yo.

12:53.572 --> 12:55.007
{\an8}We need to nip (bleep)
in the bud,

12:55.074 --> 12:56.175
{\an8}and if y'all not
gonna be friends,

12:56.242 --> 12:57.877
{\an1}just leave it at that,
nobody say nothing,

12:57.943 --> 12:59.044
and that's it.

12:59.111 --> 13:00.412
(applause)

13:00.479 --> 13:01.780
{\an8}I completely agree.

13:03.082 --> 13:04.650
I again apologize to you.

13:04.717 --> 13:06.819
{\an1}I called Infinity,
and I explained to Infinity,

13:06.886 --> 13:08.320
I know
what it feels like

13:08.387 --> 13:09.955
to have a person
wanna take you

13:10.022 --> 13:12.091
and they send you back
once things get hard.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.560
What happened was,
before I even got home,

13:14.627 --> 13:16.662
this girl right here
was on my line.

13:16.729 --> 13:18.964
I just wanna say
I am sorry.

13:19.031 --> 13:22.535
I don't know you well,
but I am so sorry,

13:22.601 --> 13:26.105
because I see for myself
how much you love this girl.

13:26.172 --> 13:27.773
I'm sorry.
And ever since then,

13:27.840 --> 13:30.543
that lady has called
and checked on me, Infinity,

13:30.609 --> 13:31.810
every other day.

13:31.877 --> 13:34.013
Let me hear from Remy.
Go ahead, Remi.

13:34.079 --> 13:35.381
{\an1}Yandy, you can sit here,
yell, curse,

13:35.447 --> 13:36.782
{\an7}and do all that (bleep)
that you want.

13:36.849 --> 13:38.751
{\an8}When you got the call
about their wedding,

13:38.817 --> 13:41.587
{\an7}you was practically
in (bleep) tears.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.289
{\an1}You not gonna get that mad
at a mother(bleep)

13:43.355 --> 13:45.191
{\an4}if you don't got
feelings for them.

13:43.355 --> 13:45.191
{\an3}(Nina)
Right.

13:45.257 --> 13:47.193
{\an1}(Remy)
I saw how happy she was

13:47.259 --> 13:50.496
{\an4}with y'all standing there
looking like the damn
Pointer Sisters.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.398
Dressed-- the same hair.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.099
{\an1}The foulest (bleep) that's
ever been said to me

13:54.166 --> 13:57.169
{\an1}has been said to me by people
that I consider family.

13:57.236 --> 14:00.272
{\an1}I apologized to Yandy,
and that was for everything.

14:00.339 --> 14:01.907
Mind you, I didn't--

14:01.974 --> 14:04.543
You don't do an overall
apology for that, okay?

14:04.610 --> 14:06.545
{\an5}That's very specific.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.545
Okay, so let me finish.

14:06.612 --> 14:09.181
{\an1}Yandy and I have been
friends for almost ten years.

14:09.248 --> 14:11.750
{\an1}There's (bleep) that I didn't
like in our relationship,

14:11.817 --> 14:13.419
{\an1}and there's (bleep) that
I loved in our relationship.

14:13.485 --> 14:15.454
{\an1}So I know her like
the back of my hand.

14:15.521 --> 14:19.992
{\an1}Now, seeing and knowing
and Infinity coming to my house,

14:20.059 --> 14:22.695
and me meeting her, yes,
I take back what I said.

14:22.761 --> 14:26.198
{\an1}Like, I have
no bad vibes over here

14:26.265 --> 14:28.934
{\an1}for what you doin'--
it's beautiful.

14:29.001 --> 14:30.769
{\an1}But I felt like--
I'm sorry, all right?

14:30.836 --> 14:32.238
{\an1}I'm sorry-- let me--
let me--

14:32.304 --> 14:35.841
{\an5}(cheering and applause)

14:32.304 --> 14:35.841
{\an1}I'm sorry for saying
what I said.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.077
Truthfully.

14:38.143 --> 14:40.846
So, Yandy, do you feel like
your friendship is over,

14:40.913 --> 14:43.449
or do you think that this is
something you guys can work on?

14:43.515 --> 14:45.517
{\an5}(Yandy)
I don't wanna answer
that question right now.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.887
Because I have a lot of emotions
about the situation.

14:48.954 --> 14:50.656
(Nina)
I can only respect that.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.659
Listen, we have to end it,
but you guys have a long history

14:53.726 --> 14:55.594
and I can see the love
between you.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.162
And I hope that time
heals all wounds,

14:57.229 --> 14:59.131
and you guys can move forward
with your families together,

14:59.198 --> 15:01.367
'cause we know you both
need each other's support.

15:01.433 --> 15:03.435
(applause)

15:03.502 --> 15:04.637
(Nina)
Just as Juelz got clean

15:04.703 --> 15:06.372
and started finding
his way back,

15:06.438 --> 15:08.407
Kimbella had to face
the prospect

15:08.474 --> 15:09.942
of losing him all over again.

15:10.009 --> 15:11.944
But this time,
to the system.

15:12.011 --> 15:13.712
{\an5}(Juelz)
The lawyer,
at first he thought

15:13.779 --> 15:15.781
18, 24 months.

15:15.848 --> 15:18.784
{\an8}But now he's saying
27 to 37 months.

15:18.851 --> 15:21.053
{\an8}And that's with a plea.
If we go to trial

15:21.120 --> 15:22.988
{\an8}and get a guilty verdict,
the time will be

15:23.055 --> 15:25.190
{\an8}47 to 57 months.

15:25.257 --> 15:27.660
{\an8}(Juelz)
I might have to go to jail.

15:28.794 --> 15:30.162
{\an7}(Kimbella)
Juelz...

15:30.229 --> 15:33.299
{\an8}I don't want you
to go away.

15:33.365 --> 15:35.634
{\an8}I want you to stay.

15:35.701 --> 15:37.903
{\an7}I wanna stay, too,
Juelz.

15:37.970 --> 15:40.272
(audience "awws")

15:40.339 --> 15:42.808
{\an5}(Nina)
I know this has been
very stressful for you.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.277
How has it affected
the family?

15:45.344 --> 15:47.079
{\an1}You know, I have
a six-year-old daughter,

15:47.146 --> 15:49.715
a seven-year-old son,
and a 16-year-old son.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.684
{\an1}And we about to have--
She's pregnant.

15:51.750 --> 15:53.719
{\an1}Which is kind of
a bittersweet for me

15:53.786 --> 15:55.587
{\an1}'cause I won't be here
to, you know,

15:55.654 --> 15:57.756
see my-- my child born.

15:57.823 --> 15:59.625
{\an1}And it kinda made me
think twice

15:59.692 --> 16:01.293
{\an1}about the decision
that was made,

16:01.360 --> 16:03.762
{\an1}whether we were
even gonna move forward

16:03.829 --> 16:05.264
{\an5}with having the baby.

16:03.829 --> 16:05.264
Mm-hmm.

16:05.331 --> 16:07.566
The thing is,
is they're not used to him

16:07.633 --> 16:10.602
taking time away
and being gone, so.

16:10.669 --> 16:12.538
{\an1}The longest time I've spent
away from them

16:12.604 --> 16:14.473
{\an1}is the month
that I spent in jail

16:14.540 --> 16:16.742
{\an1}when I got locked up,
you know,

16:16.809 --> 16:18.644
{\an1}for this incident
in the first place.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.879
And you know,
I love my kids

16:20.946 --> 16:22.314
{\an1}and my kids love me
to death.

16:22.381 --> 16:24.583
{\an1}And it's definitely
gonna be hard for them.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.452
{\an5}You know, prison,
it is what it is.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.452
Yeah.

16:26.518 --> 16:27.686
I'm gonna adapt.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.688
{\an1}But just being away
from my family and my kids

16:29.755 --> 16:31.924
{\an1}is, that's what hurts
the most for me.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.826
They were actually
trying to take me

16:33.892 --> 16:36.295
a week and a half ago,

16:36.362 --> 16:38.130
{\an1}and my lawyer
got a 30-day extension.

16:38.197 --> 16:40.299
{\an1}So I got about
another two weeks.

16:40.366 --> 16:42.668
{\an5}Two more weeks?

16:40.366 --> 16:42.668
Two weeks left.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.937
{\an8}You being locked up,
that's not gonna stop

16:45.003 --> 16:46.238
{\an8}your influence
on your family.

16:46.305 --> 16:48.173
{\an1}That's not gonna stop
your impact.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.808
{\an5}That's not gonna
stop your mental.

16:49.875 --> 16:51.944
{\an1}So they can lock your body, man,
they can't lock your mind.

16:52.010 --> 16:53.112
You know what I'm saying?

16:53.178 --> 16:54.179
{\an5}(applause)

16:53.178 --> 16:54.179
That's it, bro.

16:54.246 --> 16:55.214
That's right.

16:56.415 --> 16:57.516
(Nina)
Now, Yandy, you're nodding.

16:57.583 --> 16:58.951
And I know that you guys
are family,

16:59.017 --> 17:00.552
even though
you have differences.

17:00.619 --> 17:02.187
Is there any advice
you can give about

17:02.254 --> 17:05.089
telling young children
about their dad going away?

17:05.156 --> 17:07.459
Well, we weren't
as courageous

17:07.526 --> 17:09.428
and as strong
as you guys are

17:09.494 --> 17:11.696
when we had to tell
little Mendeecees,

17:11.763 --> 17:14.433
{\an1}we told him that his dad
was going away to the Army.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.567
And then,
what my babies think

17:15.634 --> 17:17.002
they go to their dad's job.

17:17.069 --> 17:20.071
I didn't want them
to feel singled out

17:20.138 --> 17:21.973
or super different
than their peers.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.476
So I have yet to tell them.

17:24.542 --> 17:25.810
{\an5}(Mariahlynn)
But don't feel bad
'cause I thought

17:25.877 --> 17:27.780
my father was in school
for ten years

17:27.846 --> 17:29.081
{\an5}that he was away, okay?

17:27.846 --> 17:29.081
(audience laughing)

17:29.148 --> 17:31.483
{\an4}(Juelz)
Honestly, it's nothing
wrong with that.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.286
{\an4}Everybody, everybody parents
different.

17:31.550 --> 17:34.286
{\an3}Right.

17:34.353 --> 17:36.054
{\an1}That doesn't make you
better or...

17:36.121 --> 17:37.723
{\an5}And y'all strong
'cause y'all a unit.

17:36.121 --> 17:37.723
...or not better.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.025
{\an1}There's things that
you're gonna do

17:40.092 --> 17:41.927
{\an1}that we may not be
courageous enough to do.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.996
(applause)

17:44.062 --> 17:45.230
{\an5}(Nina)
Yandy, I know
it's a difficult time,

17:45.297 --> 17:46.999
but Juelz's saying
it's gonna be two weeks

17:47.065 --> 17:49.101
really makes reality
hit you quickly.

17:49.168 --> 17:50.836
Do you feel like
you will be able to be

17:50.903 --> 17:52.738
a support system for Kimbella
and the kids?

17:52.805 --> 17:54.273
I've always loved this family

17:54.339 --> 17:56.074
and I've cried
those same tears.

17:56.141 --> 17:58.076
It is a hard road.

17:58.143 --> 17:59.545
And you know,
this whole season,

17:59.611 --> 18:01.814
what I kept saying was,
"I know she's mad at whatever."

18:01.880 --> 18:04.450
But I just wanna be there
because I know what's to come.

18:04.516 --> 18:06.685
The times when I've gone
and slept over at your house,

18:06.752 --> 18:08.353
the times when I've called
'cause I had nobody else

18:08.420 --> 18:09.621
to watch the kids,
you've been there.

18:09.688 --> 18:11.790
And I would, of course,
extend the same courtesy

18:11.857 --> 18:13.125
to you guys, of course.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.127
{\an8}And you know that.
I've told you guys that.

18:13.192 --> 18:15.127
{\an4}Right.

18:15.194 --> 18:16.728
Even through all of this
that we've been through,

18:16.795 --> 18:19.965
my biggest thing was,
why are you separating our kids?

18:20.032 --> 18:21.300
You don't got to like me,

18:21.366 --> 18:22.668
but these kids believe
that they're cousins.

18:22.734 --> 18:25.471
{\an4}I mean, right now,
our kids are together.

18:22.734 --> 18:25.471
Right.

18:25.537 --> 18:26.872
{\an1}You know, we brought
our kids out here.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.074
{\an1}Yandy has her kids
out here.

18:29.141 --> 18:30.742
My mom is back
at the hotel.

18:30.809 --> 18:32.110
Her mom is there, too.

18:32.177 --> 18:34.179
{\an1}And the kids are playing
at the pool right now.

18:34.246 --> 18:35.280
Right now,
as they should.

18:35.347 --> 18:36.448
{\an1}You know what I'm saying?
As we speak.

18:36.515 --> 18:38.884
Well, let's talk about
a happier time.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.052
Let's talk about this wedding

18:40.118 --> 18:41.820
because this is
gonna be something

18:41.887 --> 18:44.022
that supersedes jail time.

18:44.089 --> 18:45.524
This is gonna be something
that you guys think about

18:45.591 --> 18:46.758
for the rest of your lives.

18:46.825 --> 18:48.060
And I was really happy
to see this.

18:48.126 --> 18:50.195
You guys were together
for a long time.

18:50.262 --> 18:53.499
Now, did the sentence
really, Juelz, for you,

18:53.565 --> 18:55.067
make you feel like
you had to propose?

18:55.133 --> 18:57.035
Did it give you
a reality check?

18:57.102 --> 18:58.103
Not at all.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.671
{\an1}I wanna get this clear
and out there.

18:59.738 --> 19:02.808
She's been there for me.
She's been riding for me.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.776
{\an1}And you know, I've been
dragging my feet.

19:04.843 --> 19:07.880
{\an1}She been the girl that
I-I-I I wanted to marry,

19:07.946 --> 19:10.048
{\an1}I knew I was spending
the rest of my life with.

19:10.115 --> 19:12.017
I just was never
big on marriage.

19:12.084 --> 19:15.220
{\an1}I wasn't always the-- felt like
I was the marrying type

19:15.287 --> 19:17.456
{\an1}coming up as a--
You know, I'm a Harlem guy.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.057
{\an1}I'm like, you know,
you know what I'm saying?

19:19.124 --> 19:20.526
{\an5}I don't know.

19:19.124 --> 19:20.526
(laughter)

19:20.592 --> 19:21.860
(Nina)
Kimbella, were you surprised?

19:21.927 --> 19:24.196
Because usually with proposals
it's so happy.

19:24.263 --> 19:25.597
But you guys got
a lot of criticism.

19:25.664 --> 19:26.932
Were you surprised by it?

19:26.999 --> 19:29.568
People always got
something to say negative.

19:29.635 --> 19:32.604
People feed off that
negative energy

19:32.671 --> 19:35.941
and anything negative
people kinda like squirm to.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.676
So, no, it's to be expected.

19:37.743 --> 19:38.977
(Nya)
He's a New York (bleep),

19:39.044 --> 19:42.381
{\an8}and he crease the timbs
to propose to her.

19:42.447 --> 19:45.050
{\an5}So that means something.

19:42.447 --> 19:45.050
(laughter)

19:45.117 --> 19:46.118
(Nina)
You guys seem happy.

19:46.184 --> 19:47.519
{\an5}You've got a baby coming.

19:46.184 --> 19:47.519
Yes.

19:47.586 --> 19:49.588
So, you know, you guys will
get through these trials

19:49.655 --> 19:50.856
{\an5}and you have a support system.

19:49.655 --> 19:50.856
(Juelz) That's a fact.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.457
(Nina)
So we are rooting for you guys.

19:52.524 --> 19:53.892
{\an5}Thank you, Nina. Thank you.

19:52.524 --> 19:53.892
{\an3}Okay?

19:53.959 --> 19:55.694
(Nina)
All right, we wish you the best.

19:55.761 --> 19:57.229
And we will be here for you
when you're gone

19:57.296 --> 19:58.830
{\an5}and when you get back, okay?

19:57.296 --> 19:58.830
Yes.

19:58.897 --> 20:01.733
Next up, Sidney Starr struggles
to break into the music industry

20:01.800 --> 20:04.403
and realizes that this
may be her toughest transition

20:04.469 --> 20:05.771
of them all.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.205
We'll see how things went
for this hopeful rapper

20:07.272 --> 20:09.408
when "Love &amp; Hip Hop:
The Reunion" returns.

20:09.474 --> 20:11.777
(applause)

20:11.843 --> 20:14.146
{\an8}I think we have
a photo of you.

20:14.212 --> 20:17.849
{\an8}How old were you in this photo?

20:14.212 --> 20:17.849
{\an8}(excited screaming)

20:17.916 --> 20:20.419
{\an8}See, this is why I don't
wanna start crying.

20:20.485 --> 20:23.255
{\an7}That's crazy that you left me
on that stage like that!

20:23.322 --> 20:25.257
{\an8}'Cause you know how much
I care about you

20:25.324 --> 20:26.725
{\an8}that you don't back me up
a little bit.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.961
{\an8}You let this bitch tell me
that I embarrassed myself?

20:34.433 --> 20:37.369
(cheering and applause)

20:39.071 --> 20:41.807
{\an5}(Nina)
Welcome back to "Love &amp; Hip Hop:
The Reunion."

20:41.873 --> 20:44.343
{\an8}I want to welcome
to the stage Jaquae.

20:44.409 --> 20:46.311
{\an8}(applause)

20:44.409 --> 20:46.311
{\an8}All right, guys,

20:46.378 --> 20:48.680
now, Sidney Starr joined
"Love &amp; Hip Hop" this season

20:48.747 --> 20:51.283
and became our first
transgender woman

20:51.350 --> 20:54.152
{\an5}to join the cast.

20:51.350 --> 20:54.152
(applause)

20:54.219 --> 20:55.687
So, Sidney, how old were you

20:55.754 --> 20:57.389
when you first
knew you were a woman?

20:57.456 --> 20:59.825
{\an8}I really knew when I was
about eight years old.

20:59.891 --> 21:03.261
Putting on my mom's heels
when she left out.

21:03.328 --> 21:05.530
Throwing her wig on
that she wears

21:05.597 --> 21:06.999
when she goes swimming.

21:07.065 --> 21:08.233
{\an4}And--

21:07.065 --> 21:08.233
Swim in a wig?

21:08.300 --> 21:09.334
Not the swimming wig.

21:09.401 --> 21:12.638
(laughter, overlapping chatter)

21:12.704 --> 21:15.374
I think we have a photo of you
at a young age.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.376
I wanna see!

21:17.442 --> 21:19.211
(Nina)
How old were you in this photo?

21:19.277 --> 21:20.712
(excited screaming)

21:22.414 --> 21:24.583
{\an8}No! You are a bad bitch.

21:22.414 --> 21:24.583
{\an9}Yes.

21:24.650 --> 21:26.284
I was 14.

21:26.351 --> 21:28.353
I transitioned
two years after that.

21:28.420 --> 21:29.588
{\an5}Two years after this?

21:28.420 --> 21:29.588
{\an3}Yes.

21:29.655 --> 21:32.124
See, this is why I don't
wanna start crying

21:32.190 --> 21:34.393
because, like, I know
what I am.

21:34.459 --> 21:36.461
I know I'm a woman,
but I look like that.

21:36.528 --> 21:39.598
{\an1}Unfortunately, I still have
the shrimp down there.

21:39.665 --> 21:40.666
Oh.

21:40.732 --> 21:43.168
{\an6}So...

21:40.732 --> 21:43.168
(laughter)

21:43.235 --> 21:44.269
'Cause it's little.

21:44.336 --> 21:45.437
{\an5}(scattered laughter)

21:44.336 --> 21:45.437
It's like a...

21:45.504 --> 21:46.638
Sidney, you're right.

21:46.705 --> 21:48.206
{\an1}(Sidney)
Okay, all right.

21:48.273 --> 21:49.408
I'm sorry.

21:49.474 --> 21:50.308
(Nina)
It wasn't just a journey here

21:50.375 --> 21:51.610
when you were young,

21:51.677 --> 21:52.944
but also your journey
on "Love &amp; Hip Hop."

21:53.011 --> 21:54.646
So let's talk a little bit
about that, okay?

21:54.713 --> 21:57.482
Now, the new-and-improved
Nya Lee agreed

21:57.549 --> 21:59.651
to take Sidney Starr
under her wing

21:59.718 --> 22:02.220
even after getting off
to a bumpy start.

22:02.287 --> 22:04.723
But every time they seem
to be moving forward,

22:04.790 --> 22:07.526
Sidney's actions would
put things in reverse.

22:07.592 --> 22:08.927
{\an8}You wanna hear
a freestyle?

22:08.994 --> 22:10.028
{\an8}All right, cool.

22:10.095 --> 22:11.496
{\an8}♪ When I walk up in the room ♪

22:11.563 --> 22:12.998
{\an8}♪ These people staring
like I'm taking stuff ♪

22:13.065 --> 22:14.433
{\an7}♪ Just so you could feel me
'cause your (bleep) ♪

22:14.499 --> 22:16.468
{\an8}♪ Call me Venus 'cause
I got a nice penis ♪

22:16.535 --> 22:18.437
{\an8}Not only does she need
help with her bars,

22:18.503 --> 22:20.505
{\an8}she needs help
with her look,

22:20.572 --> 22:22.808
{\an8}she needs help with
her mother(bleep) wig.

22:22.874 --> 22:25.544
{\an8}Ain't nobody wanna wear
this (bleep) right there.

22:25.610 --> 22:28.447
{\an8}Bitch, that's disrespectful.
That's super disrespectful.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.482
{\an8}You ain't gonna get
nowhere in this business

22:30.549 --> 22:31.783
{\an8}doing (bleep) like that.

22:31.850 --> 22:32.918
{\an8}Look at this!

22:32.984 --> 22:35.120
{\an8}This is your dress.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.955
{\an8}But you changed
out the sleeves.

22:37.022 --> 22:39.357
{\an7}Sweetheart, I had to--
Look, no shade,

22:39.424 --> 22:43.261
{\an7}but your taste...
it wasn't happening for me.

22:43.328 --> 22:44.930
You're wasting
my mother(bleep) time.

22:44.996 --> 22:46.698
First off, Miss Skittles--

22:46.765 --> 22:48.133
No!

22:48.200 --> 22:50.001
{\an8}She is so (bleep) lucky
that this is the new Nya,

22:50.068 --> 22:51.470
{\an8}because if this was
the old Nya, I would

22:51.536 --> 22:53.238
{\an8}smack the (bleep) out
this bitch right now.

22:53.305 --> 22:54.573
{\an7}Yeah. What are you--
What are you clockin' for?

22:54.639 --> 22:55.607
{\an8}You don't wanna do that.

22:55.674 --> 22:58.744
(cheering and applause)

22:58.810 --> 23:01.346
{\an5}(Nina)
Okay, so Rich,
let me ask you first,

23:01.413 --> 23:03.315
why did you decide
that it was a good idea

23:03.381 --> 23:06.451
for Nya to kind of take on
Sydney as a mentee?

23:06.518 --> 23:09.020
{\an7}This whole situation
was new to me.

23:09.087 --> 23:12.257
{\an1}So, you being a rapper,
and you having style

23:12.324 --> 23:15.127
{\an1}and all the things that Nya
possesses, help her!

23:15.193 --> 23:17.662
{\an1}I couldn't do it,
because I'm not familiar

23:17.729 --> 23:19.064
with that terrain.

23:19.131 --> 23:21.399
{\an1}So let me find somebody
who could possibly step in

23:21.466 --> 23:22.400
and make this thing better.

23:22.467 --> 23:23.769
Okay.

23:23.835 --> 23:26.004
{\an8}I genuinely, really
wanted to help her.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.606
It's not that I hate you!

23:27.672 --> 23:29.641
{\an1}But you don't show
that you really wanna rap.

23:29.708 --> 23:31.309
{\an1}You wanna be recognized
for so much other (bleep),

23:31.376 --> 23:33.945
{\an1}You're talking to a girl
who's very passionate about rap.

23:34.012 --> 23:35.213
This industry is tough.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.782
{\an1}So if you can't take it
from people who,

23:36.848 --> 23:38.583
like me and Jaquae
and Rich over here,

23:38.650 --> 23:41.686
{\an4}genuinely care for you,
mother(bleep), they don't
give a (bleep) about you.

23:41.753 --> 23:42.921
{\an1}They gonna dog-walk
your ass, bitch,

23:42.988 --> 23:44.990
{\an1}so you gotta get
broke in at home first.

23:45.056 --> 23:46.658
{\an5}(Nina)
Let me go to Remy
really quick.

23:46.725 --> 23:48.360
Is there advice that you
can off to how

23:48.426 --> 23:50.562
she had been moving
into the studio?

23:50.629 --> 23:53.031
Honestly...

23:53.098 --> 23:55.066
{\an8}I didn't-- I didn't like it.

23:55.133 --> 23:57.102
And I think it's content.

23:57.169 --> 23:59.704
{\an4}Sometimes people think you
have to say things
for shock value.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.774
{\an4}Or, "If I say this,
it's gonna catch their ear,
they're gonna pay attention."

24:02.841 --> 24:04.709
{\an1}If it's dope music,
it's good music,

24:04.776 --> 24:06.077
and people gonna like it.

24:06.144 --> 24:09.314
{\an1}She can talk about being
the first transgender rapper--

24:09.381 --> 24:10.515
Dig deeper, you're saying.

24:10.582 --> 24:12.117
{\an1}And finally say it in a way
to where people

24:12.184 --> 24:13.552
that have been through
what she went through

24:13.618 --> 24:15.053
{\an1}will be like, "Damn,
I (bleep) with Sidney."

24:15.120 --> 24:16.555
Can I give you a hug
for that advice?

24:16.621 --> 24:18.290
{\an5}Yes, you may.

24:16.621 --> 24:18.290
{\an3}Thank you.

24:18.356 --> 24:19.925
{\an4}I think...

24:18.356 --> 24:19.925
(applause)

24:19.991 --> 24:22.194
Just tone it down a bit.

24:22.260 --> 24:24.229
That means a lot to me,
coming from you.

24:24.296 --> 24:26.031
{\an5}(Jonathan)
I don't have an issue
with her talking about

24:26.097 --> 24:28.166
sucking (bleep),
and, "I have a (bleep)."

24:28.233 --> 24:31.603
{\an8}That's actually the only part
of her music that I enjoy.

24:31.670 --> 24:32.771
{\an6}Because...

24:31.670 --> 24:32.771
(laughter)

24:32.838 --> 24:34.673
Hear me out.
Her me out.

24:34.739 --> 24:37.309
It is not fair to tell her,

24:37.375 --> 24:40.545
"Tone down that,
that is so you,"

24:40.612 --> 24:42.214
when we as people of color
would not like it

24:42.280 --> 24:45.483
{\an1}if white people told us,
"Tone down your colorfulness."

24:45.550 --> 24:47.452
{\an5}I'm not telling her
to tone down what
she's saying.

24:47.519 --> 24:49.955
I'm talking tone her
in general down.

24:50.021 --> 24:51.489
(audience murmuring)

24:51.556 --> 24:54.259
So, Sidney, what about Rich
made you want to work with him?

24:54.326 --> 24:56.361
Rich makes dreams
come true.

24:56.428 --> 24:57.963
I wouldn't be here today

24:58.029 --> 24:59.931
on this stage
if it wasn't for Rich.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.132
And I thank you so much.

25:01.199 --> 25:03.101
{\an1}(Rich)
I felt it necessary

25:03.168 --> 25:06.504
{\an4}to give somebody who
I felt deserving of
an opportunity

25:06.571 --> 25:09.341
{\an1}in spite of some of
the things that she had done.

25:09.407 --> 25:12.210
{\an4}Not to mention the fact
that she would come
to my hostings,

25:12.277 --> 25:13.678
she would pop up on me.

25:13.745 --> 25:16.214
{\an1}She would tell her fans,
"Hey, guys...

25:16.281 --> 25:17.916
tell Rich Dollaz
I need a chance."

25:17.983 --> 25:19.885
So I'd have hundreds
of people hitting me.

25:19.951 --> 25:21.319
{\an4}And I'd be like,
"Where the (bleep)
is this coming from?"

25:21.386 --> 25:22.554
{\an3}(Nina)
Mm-hmm.

25:22.621 --> 25:24.155
And this originates
with Sidney Starr.

25:24.222 --> 25:27.359
{\an4}(Jaquae)
I thought Rich was on
his Richie D, like,

25:27.425 --> 25:29.194
"Listen, I got me a--
you know what I mean?

25:29.261 --> 25:30.829
{\an1}"An artist, you know
what I'm saying?

25:30.896 --> 25:32.697
You know what I'm saying?"

25:32.764 --> 25:35.367
{\an1}But honestly,
there's no, I must say

25:35.433 --> 25:38.436
{\an4}that especially when
Sidney was like, "Yo,
I'm really hungry for this..."

25:38.503 --> 25:39.571
{\an5}Yeah.

25:38.503 --> 25:39.571
You feel me?

25:39.638 --> 25:41.039
Like, the drive
the dedication.

25:41.106 --> 25:43.842
I respect how Sidney move.

25:43.909 --> 25:45.677
Did you think she had
the talent to back it up?

25:45.744 --> 25:47.579
At that time, hell no.

25:47.646 --> 25:49.381
(Nina)
Okay.

25:49.447 --> 25:51.549
♪ I'ma ent-entertain,
da da da, da da-- ♪

25:51.616 --> 25:53.585
{\an5}I was not with none of that.

25:51.616 --> 25:53.585
(laughter)

25:53.652 --> 25:55.954
{\an5}I just wanna say,
when we got in
the studio, though,

25:56.021 --> 25:58.189
and when I heard Sidney,
and she was rapping,

25:58.256 --> 26:00.358
at first I said,
"Oh, my (bleep) goodness.

26:00.425 --> 26:03.194
{\an5}"Jesus Christ, no way
in the 40 (bleep)
nights and days.

26:03.261 --> 26:04.696
What is going on here?"

26:04.763 --> 26:06.531
Let me ask you, who's done more
for your career currently?

26:06.598 --> 26:09.134
Is it Mariah,
is it Rich, or is it Nya?

26:09.200 --> 26:11.202
Nya taught me
a valuable lesson.

26:11.269 --> 26:13.905
"Don't take friendships
for granted."

26:13.972 --> 26:16.007
Jaquae came in
to help me.

26:16.074 --> 26:19.644
Rich, uh, he's number one
at the top of the list,

26:19.711 --> 26:23.481
{\an4}because it wasn't for Rich,
I wouldn't have met
any of y'all.

26:23.548 --> 26:26.418
{\an1}And Mariah,
I love her dearly

26:26.484 --> 26:29.788
{\an5}because she stepped in
after everybody turned
their backs on me.

26:29.854 --> 26:32.190
That's actually good, because
I did want to talk about that,

26:32.257 --> 26:34.693
because, Mariah, you did
kind of get involved

26:34.759 --> 26:36.127
with Sidney's career.

26:36.194 --> 26:39.397
{\an8}You said she wasn't
prepared, so I came in,

26:39.464 --> 26:41.866
{\an8}and I made her prepared,
and I got her in
a studio session

26:41.933 --> 26:42.934
{\an8}and I gave her a bop.

26:43.001 --> 26:44.803
{\an8}I don't understand why

26:44.869 --> 26:46.504
{\an8}it's a problem for me
to be in this meeting,

26:46.571 --> 26:50.108
{\an7}because it's never a problem
for me to be in your bed.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.143
(audience murmuring)

26:52.210 --> 26:55.246
So, Rich, when we
kind of saw Mariah come in,

26:55.313 --> 26:57.182
and she played this song,

26:57.248 --> 27:00.418
why were you so upset
that she met up with Sidney

27:00.485 --> 27:01.686
and helped her
with the song?

27:01.753 --> 27:03.555
{\an1}It wasn't Mariah.
It was "insert person."

27:03.621 --> 27:05.724
{\an1}Anybody, I would have been
frustrated, like, oh, (bleep),

27:05.790 --> 27:09.728
{\an1}I'm sitting here, wanting to
talk to you because I'm unhappy

27:09.794 --> 27:11.463
and you're bringing
people to a meeting

27:11.529 --> 27:13.164
{\an1}that makes me not even
be able to really convey

27:13.231 --> 27:15.333
{\an1}what I want to convey
without trying to come off

27:15.400 --> 27:16.868
{\an1}like a bad guy
or embarrass you.

27:16.935 --> 27:19.270
The thing is is that not only
did that happen on camera,

27:19.337 --> 27:22.540
but there also have been blogs
talking about a baby.

27:22.607 --> 27:24.175
{\an5}Can you guys fill me in?

27:22.607 --> 27:24.175
{\an1}What?

27:22.607 --> 27:24.175
{\an3}Huh?

27:24.242 --> 27:27.379
Okay, I am...

27:24.242 --> 27:27.379
{\an1}What?

27:27.445 --> 27:28.446
What?

27:28.513 --> 27:29.881
{\an8}Just say what you feel.

27:29.948 --> 27:31.583
{\an8}I don't need coaching.

27:29.948 --> 27:31.583
{\an8}It's that simple.

27:31.649 --> 27:34.152
{\an8}Shut the (bleep) up
and let me speak.

27:31.649 --> 27:34.152
{\an5}Don't disrespect me either!

27:34.219 --> 27:37.789
{\an8}That was actually the
first time that I've ever
said that out loud.

27:37.856 --> 27:41.393
{\an7}I saw a communication issue
between my partner and I.

27:48.133 --> 27:50.635
There also have been blogs
talking about a baby.

27:50.702 --> 27:52.537
{\an5}Can you guys fill me in?

27:50.702 --> 27:52.537
{\an1}What?

27:50.702 --> 27:52.537
{\an3}Huh?

27:52.604 --> 27:54.639
Okay. I am...

27:54.706 --> 27:56.041
(all gasping)

27:56.107 --> 27:57.108
{\an1}What?

27:56.107 --> 27:57.108
What?

27:57.175 --> 28:00.245
{\an8}I am not pregnant.

27:57.175 --> 28:00.245
{\an8}Oh, (bleep)!

28:00.311 --> 28:03.248
Unfortunately, when he found out
that he had diabetes,

28:03.314 --> 28:08.386
{\an5}he got a vasectomy and we
have been talking about
kids for a while,

28:08.453 --> 28:11.589
so we're trying to see

28:11.656 --> 28:14.492
about this reverse thing
when he's ready,

28:14.559 --> 28:17.429
but I would one day
like to be.

28:17.495 --> 28:19.531
If I was gonna
be pregnant by anybody,

28:19.597 --> 28:21.800
it would be with a man that
I've been with for eight years

28:21.866 --> 28:24.469
who knows my situation,
who knows my mother,

28:24.536 --> 28:27.806
who accepts me, flaws and all.
I love Rich very much.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.041
{\an5}I am very much
in love with him.

28:27.872 --> 28:30.041
(all gasping)

28:30.108 --> 28:31.876
So, don't make the face.

28:31.943 --> 28:35.313
{\an5}(Nina)
I had no idea that it was this
deep. Rich, are you in love?

28:35.380 --> 28:37.882
{\an6}Ooh!

28:35.380 --> 28:37.882
{\an1}Ooh!

28:35.380 --> 28:37.882
(chatter)

28:37.949 --> 28:40.385
{\an5}Mm-mm.

28:37.949 --> 28:40.385
Say something, please.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.088
{\an5}It really makes me
look bad when you
make faces like that.

28:43.154 --> 28:44.589
{\an5}She put her heart
on the line.

28:43.154 --> 28:44.589
{\an1}She did.

28:44.656 --> 28:46.858
{\an1}You don't have no right
to sit on this stage

28:46.925 --> 28:50.195
{\an7}and talk about my... my...
my disease, my diabetes.

28:50.261 --> 28:52.297
What are you talking about?
I'm about to walk off-stage

28:52.363 --> 28:54.199
because I'm not doing
this with him.

28:54.265 --> 28:57.702
Just say what you feel.
Like, it's that simple.

28:57.769 --> 28:59.137
{\an1}Shut the (bleep) up
and let me speak.

28:59.204 --> 29:00.472
Don't (bleep)
disrespect me either.

29:00.538 --> 29:02.140
{\an8}Come on, guys, come on.

29:02.207 --> 29:03.274
{\an8}Don't talk to each
other like that.

29:03.341 --> 29:04.409
{\an8}You really gonna
disrespect me right now?

29:04.476 --> 29:05.510
All right, I'm gonna
let y'all have this.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.078
No, we're gonna have it.

29:07.145 --> 29:08.646
{\an5}Rich, Rich, Rich,
come on. Rich,
Rich, Rich, Rich!

29:08.713 --> 29:10.515
{\an5}(Mariah)
I'm not gonna hit him.
Are y'all crazy?

29:10.582 --> 29:13.084
(Jonathan)
Guys! Just come sit down.

29:13.151 --> 29:15.653
{\an5}(Mariah)
First and foremost, I been with
Rich on and off for eight years.

29:15.720 --> 29:18.423
{\an5}I was pregnant by Rich.
Yes, I've been all that.

29:15.720 --> 29:18.423
{\an3}Mariah!

29:18.490 --> 29:20.592
{\an6}Mariah!

29:18.490 --> 29:20.592
{\an5}Like, we know all that.
No, 'cause I'm tired of
this (bleep).

29:20.658 --> 29:22.160
Like, what the (bleep)?
I want to clarify

29:22.227 --> 29:25.597
that I could be with any person
that I want to be with,

29:25.663 --> 29:27.699
but when I lay next to Rich
and I'm with Rich,

29:27.765 --> 29:30.835
I feel like I can be myself,
and I didn't set myself up

29:30.902 --> 29:32.704
and I'm not embarrassed.
You know why?

29:32.770 --> 29:34.372
'Cause at the end of the day,
when we go home,

29:34.439 --> 29:35.707
we're still gonna,
"I love you,"

29:35.773 --> 29:37.308
and "I love you too,"
and it's gonna go on.

29:37.375 --> 29:39.844
{\an7}That's why she gonna keep going
through this (bleep). Derrr!

29:39.911 --> 29:41.412
(applause and laughter)

29:41.479 --> 29:44.382
{\an4}Come on! She's not
backing up. Just stop
embarrassing yourself.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.117
{\an5}I'm not embarrassing myself.

29:44.449 --> 29:46.117
{\an1}Can't you see
he's trying to play you?

29:46.184 --> 29:48.319
{\an5}I'm not embarrassing
myself.

29:46.184 --> 29:48.319
{\an1}Like,
you are! You just said,

29:48.386 --> 29:50.622
"And then when we go home, we
gonna say, 'I love you' again,

29:50.688 --> 29:53.591
{\an1}and then the next reunion,
then we'll be right back here.

29:53.658 --> 29:56.161
Listen, I don't talk on other
people's personal business.

29:56.227 --> 29:57.629
{\an5}That's why...

29:56.227 --> 29:57.629
(audience reacts)

29:57.695 --> 29:59.597
{\an1}What?

29:59.664 --> 30:01.933
First of all, Cyn, I'm talking
about relationships, okay?

30:02.000 --> 30:03.201
I'm talking about
relationships, okay?

30:03.268 --> 30:04.269
{\an1}You can have relationships,
Mariahlynn.

30:04.335 --> 30:05.770
Okay, well, then,
slow down.

30:05.837 --> 30:07.005
Tone it down 'cause you don't
need to talk to her like that.

30:07.071 --> 30:08.540
{\an1}We can have a conversation,
but cool it down.

30:08.606 --> 30:09.941
{\an1}Cool it.

30:10.008 --> 30:13.478
Let me walk offstage.
Let me walk offstage.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.514
And I'll be damned if I be the
last bitch to be embarrassed.

30:16.581 --> 30:17.916
What the (bleep)
is you talking about?

30:17.982 --> 30:19.517
Get the (bleep) out of here.

30:19.584 --> 30:22.987
Where's Rich? I want to
talk to Rich right now.

30:23.054 --> 30:25.390
Move.

30:25.456 --> 30:27.125
You see what you did?

30:27.192 --> 30:30.461
You don't back me up time
after (bleep) time, yo!

30:30.528 --> 30:32.430
You told me you was
comfortable with that.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.966
{\an5}I would have never
brought it up and
you disrespected me

30:35.033 --> 30:37.869
{\an5}and embarrassed me
in front of this
half-assed bitch.

30:37.936 --> 30:39.470
Why would you
do that to me?

30:39.537 --> 30:40.905
{\an4}Half-assed bitch?
Who's the half-assed bitch?

30:39.537 --> 30:40.905
Yes! My enemy!

30:40.972 --> 30:42.373
She just said
I embarrassed myself.

30:42.440 --> 30:44.108
{\an5}Why do I keep playing
myself with you?

30:42.440 --> 30:44.108
{\an1}Who?

30:44.175 --> 30:47.612
{\an5}Nya. That's crazy
that you left me on
that stage like that,

30:47.679 --> 30:50.615
{\an5}'cause you know how much
I care about you that you
don't back me up a little

30:50.682 --> 30:53.585
{\an5}but you let this
bitch tell me that I
embarrassed myself.

30:53.651 --> 30:55.053
{\an4}We didn't hear
any of that.

30:53.651 --> 30:55.053
{\an3}(bleep)!

30:55.119 --> 30:57.355
{\an5}Are you gonna go out
there and back me up
for once, my --?

30:57.422 --> 31:01.259
{\an8}For once, have my back!

31:01.326 --> 31:04.729
{\an8}This (bleep)'s crazy.
Yes or no?

31:04.796 --> 31:07.732
(quiet chatter)

31:12.770 --> 31:14.105
Okay, listen, listen.

31:14.172 --> 31:15.273
{\an1}Is he gonna
back me up or what?

31:15.340 --> 31:20.979
Listen, relax, okay?
Relax. Relax. Relax.

31:21.045 --> 31:23.147
{\an5}Breathe, breathe, breathe.

31:21.045 --> 31:23.147
{\an1}You don't know what I went
through all these years.

31:23.214 --> 31:26.184
I know, but breathe.
But breathe, okay?

31:26.251 --> 31:29.954
{\an8}Cyn, you were very courageous
in coming out about your past
sexual abuse.

31:30.021 --> 31:33.358
{\an8}How did your family respond?

31:33.424 --> 31:35.426
{\an7}So, I was like, "Hello,
I said it was a girls' trip."

31:35.493 --> 31:36.828
{\an8}The guys made the trip.

31:36.894 --> 31:38.730
{\an8}Y'all didn't make the trip.
Don't get ahead of yourself.

31:38.796 --> 31:39.897
{\an9}No, we did.

31:45.637 --> 31:48.773
(cheers and applause)

31:48.840 --> 31:51.442
Welcome back to
"Love &amp; Hip Hop: The Reunion."

31:51.509 --> 31:55.647
Now, before we get started,
Rich, thank you for coming back.

31:55.713 --> 31:57.348
Can you just clear up
to me what was going on?

31:57.415 --> 31:59.851
{\an7}Let's be clear.
I love Mariah to death.

31:57.415 --> 31:59.851
{\an9}Okay.

31:59.917 --> 32:02.587
{\an4}She's a good person.
It was not my intent
to embarrass her,

32:02.654 --> 32:04.922
{\an1}denounce her,
or anything of that nature.

32:04.989 --> 32:07.392
{\an4}I was taken aback by the things
that she was saying...

32:04.989 --> 32:07.392
{\an3}Okay.

32:07.458 --> 32:10.695
{\an4}in order to get me to a place
where she couldn't get me.

32:07.458 --> 32:10.695
{\an3}Right.

32:10.762 --> 32:13.698
{\an5}I think she was just a little
nervous and may have said some
things out of being nervous,

32:13.765 --> 32:17.035
{\an5}so I hope you guys can
mend it. All right,
we're gonna shift gears.

32:17.101 --> 32:21.906
{\an5}Post-partum Cyn was feeling
neglected by Joe and his
lack of sexual appetite.

32:21.973 --> 32:25.310
The pair ultimately decided to
seek help outside,

32:25.376 --> 32:29.047
{\an5}but was it enough to get Joe
in the mood for a little
"MILF and cookies"?

32:29.113 --> 32:31.683
{\an5}Let's check it out.

32:29.113 --> 32:31.683
(laughter)

32:31.749 --> 32:34.986
{\an8}I want someone who's gonna
listen to me and make me
feel like I'm important.

32:35.053 --> 32:36.287
{\an8}You don't make me feel
like that.

32:36.354 --> 32:38.056
{\an8}I've been depressed
for a few months now.

32:38.122 --> 32:41.326
{\an8}You can't even see
that 'cause all you
do is (bleep) work!

32:41.392 --> 32:43.695
And she got pregnant,

32:43.761 --> 32:47.598
{\an1}and I was super excited
because, you know...

32:47.665 --> 32:49.901
{\an5}You wanted another
chance to be a dad
and do it right.

32:49.967 --> 32:52.904
{\an7}(crying)

32:52.970 --> 32:55.973
{\an8}Can I ask what happened?

32:56.040 --> 33:00.211
{\an8}When I was five, I was raped.

33:00.278 --> 33:02.013
{\an8}But I was raped by a woman.

33:04.182 --> 33:06.050
{\an7}(crying)

33:06.117 --> 33:08.619
You guys clearly
love each other

33:08.686 --> 33:10.521
and you actually both
want the same thing.

33:10.588 --> 33:13.925
{\an7}The proper advice for y'all,
y'all need to get married.

33:13.991 --> 33:16.894
{\an8}Once y'all get married,
everything will be
more smooth for y'all.

33:16.961 --> 33:18.696
{\an7}Wow!

33:16.961 --> 33:18.696
{\an9}Check!

33:18.763 --> 33:21.966
{\an8}(laughter)

33:22.033 --> 33:27.872
{\an8}Listen, literally, last night
was completely unacceptable.

33:27.939 --> 33:31.376
{\an8}I'm trying to crack this
intolerance, impatience,
and certain (bleep).

33:31.442 --> 33:34.479
{\an8}Like, you ain't gonna work
with me? I'm supposed to just
go do it like this for life?

33:34.545 --> 33:38.649
{\an8}We never address my (bleep).

33:38.716 --> 33:42.253
{\an5}(Nina)
We have a lot to unpack
here, you guys, so let's dig
a little bit deeper, Cyn,

33:42.320 --> 33:45.523
{\an5}because you really were
vulnerable and talked about
your post-partum depression.

33:45.590 --> 33:47.258
What made you want to share
that with the world?

33:47.325 --> 33:50.728
{\an7}I said it to somebody one time
and they said to me,

33:50.795 --> 33:54.332
{\an5}"Girl, us women of color
or us Latinas, we don't
deal with that."

33:54.399 --> 33:58.569
{\an5}I was very dismissed,
so I was afraid to say
that out loud on television.

33:58.636 --> 34:01.773
{\an5}I was lost. I was afraid of
being judged a little bit.

33:58.636 --> 34:01.773
{\an1}Okay.

34:01.839 --> 34:04.575
{\an5}'Cause I'm like, I don't
know. Is-- Is that wrong
to, like, deal with?

34:04.642 --> 34:06.043
{\an5}I've never... This
is my first child.

34:04.642 --> 34:06.043
Right.

34:06.110 --> 34:08.513
{\an5}I spoke to Nya about it.

34:06.110 --> 34:08.513
You went through
the same thing?

34:08.579 --> 34:11.482
{\an8}Yeah. So when she came,
I said, "Girl, it's not
a white thing."

34:11.549 --> 34:15.420
{\an5}That's how I felt. Like,
everything was fine and
I just was so sad,

34:15.485 --> 34:17.288
so I'm like, "This is what
you're going through."

34:17.355 --> 34:19.657
Yandy, did you deal with any
type of post-partum?

34:19.724 --> 34:21.626
{\an8}I went through
a horrible depression.

34:21.692 --> 34:24.128
Like, I couldn't cut
the lights on at times.

34:24.195 --> 34:27.532
{\an5}I couldn't... I got so
depressed that I couldn't
even create milk.

34:27.598 --> 34:29.801
{\an5}I couldn't feed my baby.

34:27.598 --> 34:29.801
So, we saw that you guys

34:29.867 --> 34:33.137
sat down with Dr. Jenn.
Joe, what made you so emotional?

34:33.204 --> 34:35.572
Seeing how it was like a
full-circle thing for me,

34:35.639 --> 34:39.310
{\an8}'cause she really was
instrumental in me and my
oldest son's relationship,

34:39.377 --> 34:44.482
{\an4}so I would have never
thought back then that I
would be seeing her again

34:44.549 --> 34:48.518
{\an4}to deal with some of
the feelings that I had
with my newborn.

34:48.585 --> 34:51.121
Okay. All right. So, Cyn,
you were very courageous

34:51.188 --> 34:53.791
in coming out about
your past sexual abuse.

34:53.858 --> 34:55.659
How did your family respond,
hearing it on national TV?

34:55.726 --> 34:59.430
(takes deep breath)

34:59.497 --> 35:02.934
{\an5}That was actually the
first time that I've
ever said that out loud.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.636
My mom was like, "(bleep)!"
Like, I have to be honest,

35:05.703 --> 35:08.739
{\an5}'cause that's the only
way that we're gonna get
the help that we need,

35:08.806 --> 35:11.909
and I actually ended up
telling my mother

35:11.976 --> 35:14.178
the night before
the episode aired.

35:14.245 --> 35:15.680
It was a little
difficult for her.

35:15.746 --> 35:18.983
{\an1}She was like, "When? Where?
How did this happen?"

35:19.050 --> 35:20.918
I wanted her to know
that I was fine.

35:20.985 --> 35:23.321
Like, I went through
something. Nobody knew.

35:23.387 --> 35:24.989
You didn't know.
It's not your fault.

35:25.056 --> 35:28.125
I'm fine. Like, I don't
want you to worry.

35:28.192 --> 35:30.528
The good thing is, you do have
a good support system, so...

35:30.595 --> 35:34.198
{\an5}I'm happy that
you shared this.

35:30.595 --> 35:34.198
I have a great support
system. Thank you.

35:34.265 --> 35:38.302
All right. I want to lighten
this up a little bit.

35:38.369 --> 35:41.138
{\an5}Are you getting a nanny,
Cyn? I know you have been
dead set against it.

35:41.205 --> 35:43.841
{\an5}Mm, we got a nanny!

35:41.205 --> 35:43.841
Okay.

35:43.908 --> 35:46.410
She came to me in tears
and she was like,

35:46.477 --> 35:49.547
"I will never,
ever hurt your child.

35:49.614 --> 35:51.949
Like, you never have to
worry about that with me,"

35:52.016 --> 35:55.486
{\an5}and that made me feel
so secure, 'cause
that's the only reason

35:55.553 --> 35:57.655
{\an1}why I don't even want people
changing my baby's diaper.

35:57.722 --> 36:00.324
{\an5}Like, I don't want
nobody even looking
at my (bleep) kid

36:00.391 --> 36:03.828
{\an5}and thinking of
anything, 'cause
I went through that.

36:03.895 --> 36:06.731
So, lighten up.
The nanny's amazing.

36:06.797 --> 36:08.966
{\an5}(Nina)
So, we're watching the trip to
Costa Rica, and I'm like,

36:09.033 --> 36:11.335
{\an4}okay, this is gonna
be a great moment for
them to get together,

36:11.402 --> 36:15.373
{\an4}and then, I feel like
it kind of went left.
What happened?

36:15.439 --> 36:18.009
Sometimes I just want to be
(bleep). I'm 26 and, like,

36:18.075 --> 36:20.545
{\an5}I just want to (bleep)
have a drink with
the girls and...

36:18.075 --> 36:20.545
{\an1}Right.

36:20.611 --> 36:22.580
twerk with the girls
and do girl (bleep).

36:22.647 --> 36:26.484
{\an5}(Nina)
What was it exactly that
made you upset that made
everything go left?

36:26.551 --> 36:30.555
{\an5}I... I saw a communication issue
between my partner and I.

36:26.551 --> 36:30.555
{\an1}Okay.

36:30.621 --> 36:34.458
{\an5}He's asking me, in my
ear, like, was it me
twerking? Like...

36:34.525 --> 36:37.962
{\an5}(laughter)

36:34.525 --> 36:37.962
Oh, my God!
Like, what?

36:38.029 --> 36:40.631
{\an7}I understand where Joe
coming from 'cause he don't
want to feel like his...

36:40.698 --> 36:43.334
{\an8}his (bleep) is getting lost.

36:40.698 --> 36:43.334
{\an8}You always have to remember

36:43.401 --> 36:45.369
{\an8}that you're still
a part of a bigger whole.

36:45.436 --> 36:49.640
{\an5}I have my moments where I want
to do crazy (bleep), like,
because that is just me.

36:49.707 --> 36:53.144
Like, oh, what happened?
Oh, all right, I see how...

36:53.210 --> 36:56.080
{\an5}And he's like, "Really, babe?
That's what we doing now? We
going back to that?"

36:56.147 --> 36:58.182
{\an5}So (bleep) me,
(bleep) the baby,
and I'm like...

36:58.249 --> 37:00.251
All right, you guys made it
through the worst.

37:00.318 --> 37:03.454
Now let's talk about the moments
when you were at your best.

37:03.521 --> 37:06.924
Following Pap's advice, Joe
felt it was time to step up

37:06.991 --> 37:10.227
and lock down Cyn from three
years to life.

37:10.294 --> 37:15.399
{\an5}Let's see how the grumpy
old man sealed the deal
with his dream girl.

37:15.466 --> 37:18.069
Cynthia Pacheco...

37:18.135 --> 37:19.337
will you marry me?

37:19.403 --> 37:20.671
{\an8}(cheers and applause)

37:20.738 --> 37:21.939
{\an8}Yes!

37:22.006 --> 37:25.276
{\an8}(cheers and applause)

37:27.478 --> 37:30.648
(cheers and applause)

37:30.715 --> 37:33.250
All right, guys, so I need to
know, is there a date set?

37:33.317 --> 37:36.587
{\an5}He wants to focus
a little more, because
we want a big wedding.

37:36.654 --> 37:39.123
{\an1}We do?

37:36.654 --> 37:39.123
Yeah. Don't we?

37:39.190 --> 37:42.126
{\an1}No. We said intimate
wedding, big reception.

37:42.193 --> 37:43.995
Okay. Excuse me.
I don't know yet.

37:44.061 --> 37:47.098
{\an5}I want that day to be
absolutely magical.

37:44.061 --> 37:47.098
Right.

37:47.164 --> 37:49.667
Ultimately, you did decide to
propose at your podcast.

37:49.734 --> 37:51.469
What made you decide
to do it there?

37:51.535 --> 37:53.971
{\an4}Just about the timing.
I thought that if
I did it early,

37:54.038 --> 37:56.374
{\an1}I wouldn't have to
get a Christmas gift.

37:56.440 --> 37:58.509
{\an5}(laughter)

37:56.440 --> 37:58.509
He thought wrong,
though.

37:58.576 --> 38:00.711
We wish you guys the best.
I can't wait to see

38:00.778 --> 38:03.414
more babies, more proposals,
more weddings, all that.

38:03.481 --> 38:07.618
Next up, a girls' trip to Costa
Rica, it goes co-ed, all right?

38:07.685 --> 38:10.421
{\an5}Will "beaches" start
trippin' and start making
trouble in paradise?

38:10.488 --> 38:13.591
{\an5}We'll see more when
"Love &amp; Hip Hop: The Reunion"
returns after this.

38:13.658 --> 38:17.728
(cheers and applause)

38:17.795 --> 38:19.630
{\an8}Double our security
at the front entrance.

38:19.697 --> 38:22.566
{\an8}I'm walking out.
I'm walking out.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.335
{\an8}(Nina)
Please welcome to the stage...

38:24.402 --> 38:27.138
{\an8}♪♪

38:32.009 --> 38:34.779
(cheers and applause)

38:38.449 --> 38:43.521
{\an5}Welcome back. Juju and
the crew invaded Costa Rica and
had the time of their lives.

38:43.587 --> 38:45.289
Let's chat about how they
managed to have fun

38:45.356 --> 38:47.692
without creating
an international incident.

38:47.758 --> 38:53.197
{\an5}Okay, so, Juju, let's talk
about this girls' trip that
turned into a co-ed trip.

38:47.758 --> 38:53.197
{\an1}Right.

38:53.264 --> 38:56.200
{\an5}How do you feel about
it kind of transforming
into something else?

38:56.267 --> 38:59.070
{\an7}Um, at first, I was
like, "Hello, I said
it was a girls' trip,"

38:59.136 --> 39:01.539
{\an1}but it was so fun and
it was very therapeutic.

39:01.605 --> 39:03.207
{\an5}It was... It was fun.

39:01.605 --> 39:03.207
The guys made the trip.

39:03.274 --> 39:04.742
{\an1}Well, wait, wait,
wait, wait.

39:04.809 --> 39:06.677
{\an4}Don't-- Don't--
Don't--

39:04.809 --> 39:06.677
No.

39:06.744 --> 39:08.679
{\an1}No, no, no, no.
Y'all didn't make the trip.

39:08.746 --> 39:10.548
{\an5}Don't get ahead
of yourselves.

39:08.746 --> 39:10.548
No, we did, we did.

39:10.614 --> 39:11.816
You guys did look like you guys
had a lot of fun.

39:11.882 --> 39:14.385
{\an5}Oh, we had a lot of fun.

39:11.882 --> 39:14.385
You guys went ziplining.

39:14.452 --> 39:15.653
{\an8}Okay, was this scary
for anybody?

39:15.720 --> 39:17.021
{\an7}Yes!

39:15.720 --> 39:17.021
{\an9}Hell yeah!

39:17.088 --> 39:18.622
{\an8}Like, was anybody scared?
Were you all terrified?

39:18.689 --> 39:20.658
{\an8}Yeah, listen, I was
scared a little bit.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.658
{\an5}You were scared, Maino?

39:20.725 --> 39:23.160
{\an4}I did every zipline, though,
and it was, like, what,
four or five of 'em?

39:23.227 --> 39:24.628
There were four
different kinds?

39:24.695 --> 39:25.996
{\an5}I went all the way
to the end.

39:24.695 --> 39:25.996
Okay.

39:26.063 --> 39:27.264
{\an5}Yes, you did.

39:26.063 --> 39:27.264
Cyn punked out on me.

39:27.331 --> 39:29.400
{\an8}Not me. I punked out.

39:29.467 --> 39:32.269
{\an8}I... I actually was afraid
at first. I did it.

39:32.336 --> 39:34.338
They said you gotta do
the Superman move to go down.

39:34.405 --> 39:35.873
I said, "I'm not doing
none of that."

39:35.940 --> 39:38.275
Can we talk about this, uh,
surf lesson that also happened?

39:38.342 --> 39:39.710
{\an7}That was...
That was cool.

39:39.777 --> 39:40.978
{\an7}But I'm the only one
that did it!

39:41.045 --> 39:43.380
{\an8}Right. I'm like, wait,
is he gonna do it?

39:43.447 --> 39:46.417
{\an5}(Cyn)
Joe not getting
in the water.

39:43.447 --> 39:46.417
You don't know how to swim?

39:46.484 --> 39:47.785
I can get from point A
to point B.

39:47.852 --> 39:49.920
{\an5}Okay.

39:47.852 --> 39:49.920
(laughter)

39:49.987 --> 39:52.056
{\an5}You can get from point A
to point B.

39:49.987 --> 39:52.056
Wait a minute.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.558
How I do it,
I wouldn't call it swimming.

39:54.625 --> 39:55.726
{\an3}Wait.

39:54.625 --> 39:55.726
Okay.

39:55.793 --> 39:59.430
(laughter)

39:59.497 --> 40:02.166
Joe, that's the time to learn.
Hello.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.768
{\an4}Nah, they left me
out there to go...
to do the surf lesson.

40:03.834 --> 40:05.436
Yeah, you did a good job.

40:05.503 --> 40:07.204
{\an5}I tried, man.

40:05.503 --> 40:07.204
Maino, you might...

40:07.271 --> 40:08.606
you might have, like,
a hood nature show going on...

40:08.672 --> 40:09.874
{\an4}Yes.

40:08.672 --> 40:09.874
You're very adventurous.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.542
{\an4}I might be able
to do that.

40:09.940 --> 40:11.542
Yeah.

40:11.609 --> 40:14.078
All I needed was,
like, one more hour.

40:14.145 --> 40:15.646
Okay. So, we might see more
surfing in your future.

40:15.713 --> 40:16.814
Yeah, you might,
you might, you might.

40:16.881 --> 40:18.215
All right, all right.

40:18.282 --> 40:20.384
Now, it wasn't just fun
in the sun in Costa Rica.

40:20.451 --> 40:23.754
{\an5}There was also
some drama courtesy
of our friend Safaree...

40:23.821 --> 40:25.790
Double our security
at the front entrance.

40:25.856 --> 40:27.691
{\an5}I'm walking out.

40:25.856 --> 40:27.691
...who has decided
to join us,

40:27.758 --> 40:30.294
so we want to welcome Safaree.

40:30.361 --> 40:34.098
(cheers and applause)

40:34.165 --> 40:35.533
(groans)
Oh!

40:39.170 --> 40:40.671
{\an7}(Cyn)
Whatever's between you and Joe
is between me, you, and Joe.

40:40.738 --> 40:42.606
{\an8}I'm a grown-ass
mother(bleep) bitch!

40:42.673 --> 40:46.477
{\an8}You a clown.

40:42.673 --> 40:46.477
{\an7}Watch your (bleep) tone,
you bitch-ass (bleep).

40:46.544 --> 40:48.212
{\an8}(mockingly)
"I was an Internet celebrity."

40:48.279 --> 40:50.481
{\an8}Internet celebrity for what?
You were goofing men.

40:50.548 --> 40:51.615
{\an8}Everybody (bleep).

40:51.682 --> 40:54.351
{\an8}Let's be honest,
you are messy.

40:54.418 --> 40:55.653
{\an8}You're a (bleep) clown.

40:55.719 --> 40:57.087
{\an8}You're the whole
circus, bitch,

40:57.154 --> 40:59.590
{\an8}and I'm the ringleader.
Welcome to my show, bitch.

40:59.657 --> 41:02.092
{\an8}I didn't mock her
(bleep) mama!

41:02.159 --> 41:05.696
{\an8}I'm getting emotional
because I don't know
who this person is here.

41:05.763 --> 41:07.198
{\an8}It breaks my heart.

41:07.264 --> 41:11.502
{\an8}I'm 5'1". This bitch is 10 feet
tall like a Jolly Green Giant!

41:11.569 --> 41:13.871
{\an7}I'ma run you over
with a vehicle, bitch!

41:13.938 --> 41:16.540
{\an7}...(bleep) is however many
(bleep) you can move from me.

41:16.607 --> 41:18.108
{\an8}Don't be disrespectful.
Don't be disrespectful.

41:16.607 --> 41:18.108
{\an5}Are we doing that?

41:18.175 --> 41:20.077
{\an8}Are we doing that?

41:18.175 --> 41:20.077
{\an8}Don't talk about
somebody like that.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.245
{\an8}She's not here.

41:20.144 --> 41:21.245
{\an8}Are we doing that?

41:21.312 --> 41:22.613
{\an8}Mother(bleep)...

41:21.312 --> 41:22.613
{\an8}(screams and chatter)

41:38.696 --> 41:41.665
{\an8}♪♪
