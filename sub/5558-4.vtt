08:23.166 --> 08:26.333
without having any
of the responsibilities.

08:26.333 --> 08:28.208
I don’t understand.

08:28.208 --> 08:30.583
Just let-let Jen...

08:30.583 --> 08:33.709
you know, uh, mother
the...the baby.

08:33.709 --> 08:37.000
And just enjoy
your granddaughter.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.333
Oh, I see.

08:39.333 --> 08:41.291
Did Jen ask you to speak to me?

08:41.291 --> 08:42.792
-No.
-No.

08:42.792 --> 08:46.959
-This is coming from you?
-No! Uh...

08:46.959 --> 08:50.000
I...
agree with her.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.250
-You do?
-But I agree with you, too.

08:52.250 --> 08:53.875
I agree

08:53.875 --> 08:56.792
with everyone

08:56.792 --> 08:58.500
about everything.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.458
I mean, I’m just really happy,

09:00.458 --> 09:03.875
you know, with the situation,

09:03.875 --> 09:07.250
with parenthood,

09:07.250 --> 09:08.208
with...

09:15.083 --> 09:16.125
Just, you know...

09:17.417 --> 09:18.250
(sighs)

09:20.750 --> 09:22.417
Hey, Mom said you yelled at her.

09:22.417 --> 09:24.125
What? I didn’t yell at her.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.583
Okay, listen, I’m coming over.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.041
GREG:<i> No, no, no.</i>
-Yes, yes, yes.

09:27.041 --> 09:29.333
(cork pops, whooping)
HEATHER: This is huge.

09:29.333 --> 09:32.291
You finally picked
another woman over Mom.

09:32.291 --> 09:33.875
MATT:
I came as soon as I heard.

09:33.875 --> 09:35.875
GREG: Heard what?
-You screamed at Mom?

09:35.875 --> 09:37.792
I am so proud of you.

09:37.792 --> 09:39.458
Yeah, and I didn’t
even tell him to do it.

09:39.458 --> 09:41.291
It’s kind of like
you read my mind, though.

09:41.291 --> 09:43.875
-I didn’t scream at Mom.
-We are so proud of you.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.291
Yeah, really, it’s about time.

09:45.291 --> 09:47.834
Hey, don’t let our mom fool you
with that voice of caramel.

09:47.834 --> 09:49.375
-She will gut a bitch.
-Oh, I know.

09:49.375 --> 09:50.959
It’s like she tries
to hypnotize you

09:50.959 --> 09:53.917
(softly): with that sweet music
coming from her mouth,

09:53.917 --> 09:55.458
when what
she’s really saying is,

09:55.458 --> 09:57.291
(growling):
"You are a disappointment."

09:57.291 --> 09:59.125
Oh, well, hey, don’t
let her throw you, Jen.

09:59.125 --> 10:01.208
-You are an awesome mom.
-Yep.

10:01.208 --> 10:02.458
Thank you.

10:02.458 --> 10:04.750
HEATHER: Okay, I’m just gonna
get you a smaller blanket

10:04.750 --> 10:06.792
so you don’t wrap this
around your little neck,

10:06.792 --> 10:10.667
and let’s get that
choking hazard out of there.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.083
Oh, my God.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.583
-You’re doing it, too.
-What?

10:14.583 --> 10:18.208
Is this, like,
a thing in your family?

10:18.208 --> 10:19.417
What are you looking at him for?

10:21.750 --> 10:24.375
I agree with all of you.

10:24.375 --> 10:26.792
Oh, that’s good.
You’re killing this.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.709
ANNOUNCER (over TV):
<i>Quarterback sneak...</i>

10:28.709 --> 10:30.417
Hey.

10:30.417 --> 10:32.792
Next time you want to get tough
with one of your parents,

10:32.792 --> 10:35.208
come at me, not your mom.

10:35.208 --> 10:36.792
What is happening?

10:36.792 --> 10:39.208
John, it’s fine.

10:39.208 --> 10:40.875
He was right to speak up.

10:40.875 --> 10:43.667
He’s supporting his wife.

10:43.667 --> 10:45.709
-Thanks, Mom.
-I still feel like a good fight.

10:45.709 --> 10:47.625
-Tim!
-Yeah.

10:47.625 --> 10:50.709
Oh, she’s so beautiful.

10:50.709 --> 10:52.333
And...? (chuckles)

10:52.333 --> 10:53.792
Just like her mom.

10:56.166 --> 10:57.750
Agree with your mother.

11:00.583 --> 11:01.709
GREG:
Pretty cute, huh?

11:01.709 --> 11:03.959
You think you’re gonna want
to babysit her one day?

11:03.959 --> 11:05.834
Mm-hmm.

11:05.834 --> 11:07.500
Not to change the subject,

11:07.500 --> 11:10.417
but I’ve noticed she’s not
getting a lot of tummy time,

11:10.417 --> 11:11.875
which is crucial
at this stage

11:11.875 --> 11:13.834
for neck
and head development.

11:19.291 --> 11:20.834
HEATHER: I think it’s emotional.

11:20.834 --> 11:23.125
Like when I was a kid
and I killed all those turtles.

11:23.125 --> 11:23.875
What?

11:28.917 --> 11:30.875
SAMANTHA:<i> Get out of my room!</i>
SOPHIA:<i> Stop!</i>

11:32.750 --> 11:33.750
(all shouting)

11:33.750 --> 11:35.125
Get out!

11:35.125 --> 11:38.083
Okay, okay, which one of
you do I need to yell at?

11:38.083 --> 11:39.750
She’s trying to sleep in my bed.

11:39.750 --> 11:41.000
Well, sweetie, calm down.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.041
It’s just, it’s a new house.
She’s not used to it.

11:43.041 --> 11:44.875
You have your own
room now, honey.

11:44.875 --> 11:47.041
Yeah, if you don’t want it,
I’ll turn it into a gym.

11:47.041 --> 11:49.125
I got that Bowflex we’re
still making payments on.

11:50.750 --> 11:53.125
But the walls have eyes.

11:53.125 --> 11:55.667
HEATHER: Honey, no,
it’s just an air vent.

11:55.667 --> 11:57.125
I want to sleep in here.

11:57.125 --> 11:58.959
No way. She picks her nose.

11:58.959 --> 12:01.291
I’ve seen her get
two knuckles deep.

12:01.291 --> 12:02.583
-Oh, God.
-I hate you.

12:02.583 --> 12:04.166
TIM: Hey! Come on.
-Leave!

12:04.166 --> 12:05.792
You know your mom
hates booger talk.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.667
All right, how long’s
she been doing this?

12:07.667 --> 12:09.542
-A few weeks.
-And does she eat it?

12:09.542 --> 12:11.375
Does she pick her
nose and then...

12:11.375 --> 12:12.291
No, no.

12:12.291 --> 12:13.458
Thank you, God.

12:13.458 --> 12:15.083
She wipes it on the sheets.

12:15.083 --> 12:16.542
(groans)
I think I might be sick.

12:16.542 --> 12:18.250
Why can’t she just
roll it into a ball

12:18.250 --> 12:20.417
and flick it across the room
like everybody else?

12:20.417 --> 12:22.250
Okay, so we need to be
careful about this.

12:22.250 --> 12:23.834
Yeah, we make too big
a deal out of it,

12:23.834 --> 12:25.792
then it’s fetishized
and next thing you know,

12:25.792 --> 12:27.542
she’s 35, buying boogers
on Craigslist.

12:27.542 --> 12:28.875
Okay, I think
it’s emotional.

12:28.875 --> 12:31.083
Like when I was a kid
and I killed all those turtles.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.166
-What?
-Nothing.

12:33.166 --> 12:35.375
-One of us has to talk to her.
-Fine, I’ll go.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.542
Okay, but talk to her
like you’re her father,

12:37.542 --> 12:39.291
not an ear,
nose and throat doctor.

12:39.291 --> 12:40.917
Well, that confuses me
because I talk

12:40.917 --> 12:42.709
to all my patients
like I’m their father.

12:42.709 --> 12:45.375
TYLER: Mom?
-Go, go, go.

12:45.375 --> 12:47.667
She won’t leave and you told me
I can’t smack her.

12:47.667 --> 12:50.041
Sophia, honey, you have
to sleep in your own bed.

12:50.041 --> 12:52.166
I hate my bed.

12:52.166 --> 12:54.000
I want to move
back to our old house.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.000
-All right, I’m going in.
-Yeah.

12:57.000 --> 12:58.166
She can’t sleep in my bed.

12:58.166 --> 13:01.625
I know, and you don’t have to
be embarrassed about it.

13:01.625 --> 13:02.834
-What?
-Morning wood

13:02.834 --> 13:03.750
is not a big deal.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.291
There’s a reason
why that happens.

13:05.291 --> 13:06.375
-Mom, no.
-What?!

13:06.375 --> 13:09.083
What? Why? Hey, why are you
making this weird?

13:12.000 --> 13:13.959
Hey, kiddo.

13:13.959 --> 13:15.875
Listen, um,
I get it.

13:15.875 --> 13:17.792
You’ve always shared a room
with your sister

13:17.792 --> 13:19.417
and now you have to sleep
by yourself,

13:19.417 --> 13:21.875
and that can be
very scary.

13:21.875 --> 13:25.375
(sniffles)

13:25.375 --> 13:27.834
Wow, it’s like sleeping
on a gravel road.

13:27.834 --> 13:30.834
I’m not picking my nose
because I’m scared.

13:30.834 --> 13:34.291
-Then why?
-It’s a peanut.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.125
I stuck it up there
two weeks ago

13:36.125 --> 13:37.333
and I can’t get it out.

13:37.333 --> 13:39.500
What are you doing sticking
a peanut up your nose?

13:39.500 --> 13:42.583
You always say try everything.

13:42.583 --> 13:45.041
Yeah.

13:45.041 --> 13:46.583
That’s why I got
the Bowflex.

13:47.625 --> 13:49.500
Ah.

13:49.500 --> 13:51.166
(groans)

13:51.166 --> 13:53.250
Hey, why didn’t you just
tell us about this?

13:53.250 --> 13:55.834
I didn’t want you to think
I was a stupid little kid.

13:55.834 --> 13:58.875
Hey, there’s nothing stupid
about sticking a...

13:58.875 --> 14:00.875
You-You’re not stupid.

14:00.875 --> 14:02.417
You know what I think?

14:02.417 --> 14:04.208
I think you telling
us about this--

14:04.208 --> 14:05.375
very grown-up thing to do.

14:05.375 --> 14:07.875
And that’s how I know you’re
ready to sleep in your own bed.

14:07.875 --> 14:09.291
I don’t know.

Okay, we can never
tell him about that.

17:37.750 --> 17:38.750
She’ll be here in 15.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.125
Nice.

17:40.125 --> 17:41.417
Yeah, I guess I’m the only one

17:41.417 --> 17:43.542
who hasn’t been running
off to the trees.

17:43.542 --> 17:44.542
(laughs)

17:44.542 --> 17:46.000
(yelps)
What are you...?

17:46.000 --> 17:47.000
God.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.333
Beating my dad?
What, do you have heatstroke?

17:49.333 --> 17:51.291
-Honey, it’s okay.
-No. No, it’s not.

17:51.291 --> 17:53.500
It never will be again
if you don’t pull back.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.917
I am having the
round of my life.

17:54.917 --> 17:56.917
And your dad is an adult--
he can handle losing.

17:56.917 --> 17:58.709
No, not to you--
he’s had an issue with you

17:58.709 --> 18:01.000
ever since you refused
to ask for my hand in marriage.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.834
I didn’t refuse to
ask him; I asked him.

18:02.834 --> 18:04.417
-He said no.
-Okay, well, whatever.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.208
You have worked very hard
to get to a place

18:06.208 --> 18:08.542
where he tolerates you,
so don’t screw that up.

18:08.542 --> 18:10.166
I’m not screwing it up.

18:10.166 --> 18:12.417
Did you ever think maybe he
wants me to challenge him?

18:12.417 --> 18:15.458
Show him that maybe I’m as
much of a man as he is?

18:15.458 --> 18:18.667
No, I never thought that because
I don’t have dumb thoughts.

18:20.166 --> 18:22.125
I’m going back out there.

18:22.125 --> 18:23.041
Hey, hey.

18:23.041 --> 18:25.000
This is like the time
you thought you could eat

18:25.000 --> 18:27.959
an entire 42-ounce
porterhouse steak by yourself.

18:27.959 --> 18:29.417
My mistake was eating the fat.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.959
Okay, you are eating
the fat right now.

18:31.959 --> 18:34.208
Hey, what took you
so long?

18:34.208 --> 18:36.625
-It’s hot out here.
-Not as hot as I am.

18:36.625 --> 18:38.709
Look at this. I thought
she was gonna talk to him.

18:38.709 --> 18:40.583
Whatever she said to him,
it didn’t work.

18:40.583 --> 18:42.458
This is like when he
tried to eat that steak.

18:42.458 --> 18:43.375
Yeah.

18:43.375 --> 18:45.500
Hey, did you guys know these
are your sister’s clubs?

18:48.834 --> 18:49.917
You’re up, Chi-Chi Blanco.

18:55.375 --> 18:56.792
It’s with God now.

19:00.375 --> 19:03.125
(laughs)
Is that mine?

19:03.125 --> 19:05.208
Ah, the old
birdie tap-in.

19:05.208 --> 19:06.500
Congratulations.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.000
Oh, well, you
guys, too, really.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.417
Hell of a round,
hell of a round.

19:09.417 --> 19:11.375
I mean, you, that
drive on seven.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.792
You take away the wind,
and you are on the fairway.

19:13.792 --> 19:16.709
And you, you play every
shot out of the sand

19:16.709 --> 19:18.125
and you’d own this course.

19:18.125 --> 19:19.375
And this guy.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.959
Hey, most improved.

19:23.917 --> 19:26.000
JOHN: Yeah, and you had
a great round, too.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.458
And you should be
proud of that.

19:27.458 --> 19:29.166
You finish strong,
like I do.

19:29.166 --> 19:32.583
Wow, thanks, Dad.

19:32.583 --> 19:34.417
I love you, son.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.458
Losing to Tim.

Ugh.
Uh, it’s no big deal.

We each take a par
