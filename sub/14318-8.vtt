WEBVTT

00:00.042 --> 00:02.127
[Narrator] Previously on
X-Men...

00:02.211 --> 00:05.088
The Leader has promised that
you mutants will be released

00:05.172 --> 00:07.174
once this dam is built.

00:07.257 --> 00:10.344
But if you try to escape,
you will never leave Genosha.

00:10.427 --> 00:14.056
This mutant apprehended
while attempting to escape.

00:14.473 --> 00:15.474
[Jubilee] Storm!

00:15.557 --> 00:16.850
We'll have our own power grid

00:16.934 --> 00:18.143
once the dam is finished.

00:18.227 --> 00:19.520
Then Mastermold's children

00:19.603 --> 00:21.313
will be able
to track down mutants

00:21.396 --> 00:22.648
anywhere on the planet.

00:22.898 --> 00:25.943
[Leader] I understand
there was a revolt
by the slaves.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.569
[Trask] We allowed it
to happen

00:27.653 --> 00:29.238
to break their spirit.

00:29.321 --> 00:30.906
You should have
seen their faces

00:30.989 --> 00:32.616
when I showed them
who had betrayed them.

00:32.699 --> 00:34.952
He calls himself Gambit.

00:35.577 --> 00:37.287
[groans]

00:37.371 --> 00:38.580
Quickly, cherie!

00:38.664 --> 00:40.541
I knew you would rescue us.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.751
Imminent danger.

00:43.377 --> 00:48.048
I summon the full power
of the storm!

00:52.469 --> 00:53.929
[Cyclops] Come in, Professor.

00:54.471 --> 00:55.806
I'm getting a visual on the...

00:55.889 --> 00:56.890
The school!

00:56.974 --> 00:58.225
[Rogue] It can't be!

02:12.299 --> 02:15.552
There's still no answer.
That's odd.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.013
Maybe the Prof's
taking a snooze.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.974
You think you can land
this tub by yourself?

02:21.808 --> 02:22.976
Touchdown in two minutes.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.395
I'm getting a visual on the...

02:25.479 --> 02:26.480
the school!

02:26.563 --> 02:27.648
It can't be!

02:34.404 --> 02:36.406
What if
the Professor's in there?

02:37.032 --> 02:38.158
We're gonna find out.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.496
[Storm] Begin searching
the ruins, but take care.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.540
Professor Xavier
may be among them.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.209
People don't
know we live here.

02:47.292 --> 02:49.044
Who'd do this to a school?

02:49.670 --> 02:53.048
Come on, Professor.
Stop playing around.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.216
Tell us you're all right.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.561
Wind, aid my hands!

03:08.146 --> 03:10.148
[Cyclops on radio] Storm,
any sign of the Professor?

03:11.191 --> 03:12.276
None.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.027
No damage to the hangar area.

03:14.111 --> 03:15.445
We're on our way
to the War Room.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.574
[Jean] Professor,
wherever you are,

03:18.657 --> 03:20.450
you must answer me now.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.744
Please.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.497
There's no response.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.082
That means he's gone

03:27.791 --> 03:29.126
or unconscious

03:30.127 --> 03:31.128
or...

03:31.211 --> 03:33.255
[Cyclops on radio] Jean? Jean!

03:33.505 --> 03:35.883
Uh... Yes, Cyclops?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.302
Have everyone come down
to the War Room.

03:38.385 --> 03:39.761
We've found something.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.558
Cerebro has a message
from the Professor. Jubilee.

03:44.641 --> 03:45.642
[beeps]

03:46.768 --> 03:47.978
Greetings, X-Men.

03:48.061 --> 03:49.938
I'm taking a journey

03:50.022 --> 03:52.691
whose results may change
our lives forever.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.986
I cannot tell you anything
more now. Farewell.

03:56.320 --> 03:59.573
Well, we've done a fine job
looking after the school.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.534
This message was left before
the mansion was destroyed.

04:02.618 --> 04:04.661
I just hope the Professor
made it out in time.

04:07.414 --> 04:08.415
Find any clues?

04:08.665 --> 04:09.833
[Wolverine] Maybe.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.586
Don't take off.
We have to plan
our next move.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.505
Do whatever
you want, pal.

04:14.588 --> 04:17.382
Something tells me
the Professor wants
to be found

04:17.466 --> 04:19.134
while he's still breathing.

04:19.218 --> 04:21.970
The Professor wants us
to work as a team.

04:22.054 --> 04:23.347
Where's Wolverine going?

04:23.430 --> 04:25.432
His own way,
like he always does.

04:25.516 --> 04:27.392
I just hope his keen senses

04:27.476 --> 04:29.311
tell him not to take
this thing on alone.

04:29.645 --> 04:32.189
Whoa! Bigfoot time.

04:32.481 --> 04:34.441
Are you sure we wanna
find this guy?

04:34.525 --> 04:36.735
Storm, take Rogue
and Jubilee.

04:36.818 --> 04:39.071
Track Wolverine down
and stay close to him.

04:39.321 --> 04:41.406
I don't care what he says,
he's gonna need you.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.158
We shall leave at once.

04:45.327 --> 04:48.247
Why must Wolverine
always rush off in this way?

04:48.497 --> 04:50.457
Come on, Storm.
It's 'cause he's worried

04:50.541 --> 04:52.084
about the Professor,
that's all.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.253
It's more like he wants
to kick some butt.

04:54.545 --> 04:55.963
Whatever the reason,

04:56.046 --> 04:59.258
Professor Xavier's first rule
is to work as a team.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.426
Look, there's his Jeep.

05:01.510 --> 05:02.719
[breaks screech]

05:07.432 --> 05:10.394
We shall find Wolverine
more quickly if we separate.

05:10.477 --> 05:13.313
Remember to keep in touch
at all times.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.358
I hope I find him first.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.402
Me and Wolverine
can take on anything.

05:19.236 --> 05:21.113
[workers grumbling]

05:23.490 --> 05:25.075
What's eating the hard hats?

05:25.158 --> 05:27.870
Looks like they got replaced
by some foreign guy.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.413
They think he's a mutant.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.915
Is he, like, real big?

05:32.124 --> 05:33.792
Hey, Mike.
You better make sure

05:33.876 --> 05:35.586
Super Russki
doesn't malfunction.

05:35.669 --> 05:37.421
[laughter]

05:37.838 --> 05:39.214
[energy buzzes]

05:42.301 --> 05:43.886
That's gotta be him.

05:45.387 --> 05:46.430
Huh?

05:46.513 --> 05:48.015
[screams]

05:54.813 --> 05:56.023
What the--

06:00.485 --> 06:02.446
[Russian accent]
Your building is crushed.

06:07.492 --> 06:08.994
Any more today?

06:09.411 --> 06:11.830
Great job. What'd you say
your name was again?

06:12.039 --> 06:13.916
I am Colossus, from Russia.

06:13.999 --> 06:17.169
His name is mutant scab,
and that's our money!

06:17.252 --> 06:19.838
That's gotta be the guy
that totaled the mansion.

06:20.172 --> 06:21.757
[angry grunts]

06:22.007 --> 06:23.258
Let's get him.

06:23.675 --> 06:24.676
Huh?

06:24.760 --> 06:26.553
Not so fast, little Jubilee.

06:26.762 --> 06:29.097
Let's see how he
handles these guys.

06:29.723 --> 06:31.308
Go back to Russia, scab.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.560
Leave him alone.
He got the job done.

06:33.727 --> 06:34.853
You guys can clean up.

06:35.103 --> 06:37.272
We're not working
for any mutant lover.

06:37.523 --> 06:40.192
What's wrong?
Was my job no good?

06:40.442 --> 06:45.405
No, no.
They wanted to crush...
Knock over the building.

06:45.489 --> 06:48.492
[Colossus] Comrades, let us
all work together.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.162
[workers shouting]

06:56.208 --> 06:57.376
Look out!

07:00.379 --> 07:01.880
Did you see that?

07:01.964 --> 07:03.257
Didn't even phase him.

07:03.340 --> 07:04.758
Let me go!

07:06.134 --> 07:09.513
Now you run away.
What I have done wrong?

07:09.721 --> 07:10.973
[Wolverine]
The first thing was

07:11.056 --> 07:13.141
crushing the Professor's
mansion.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.520
Oh!

07:23.360 --> 07:25.237
Guy's got a great arm.

07:25.612 --> 07:27.573
You Americans are all crazy.

07:27.656 --> 07:28.740
Leave him alone!

07:34.538 --> 07:35.747
[screams]

07:37.541 --> 07:39.543
Put me down, you big ox!

07:40.043 --> 07:42.796
Why do you fight Colossus,
little one?

07:43.547 --> 07:45.674
Just let me get
a good shot at you.

07:45.841 --> 07:47.843
You must stop this,
little one!

07:48.218 --> 07:49.469
[grunts in anger]

07:54.433 --> 07:57.936
What do you want?
I do not know of
any mansion.

07:58.020 --> 07:59.563
It is a mistake.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.814
[sniffs]

08:00.898 --> 08:02.191
You're right, Ivan.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.483
Whoa!

08:03.567 --> 08:05.944
What is it
with these Americans?

08:06.028 --> 08:08.113
They are very strange people.

08:10.908 --> 08:12.201
Wolverine.

08:14.203 --> 08:16.163
Come on. He's getting away!

08:16.538 --> 08:17.539
He's not the guy.

08:17.789 --> 08:19.291
Get a clue.

08:19.374 --> 08:21.543
You think he's not the guy
just 'cause he said so?

08:21.960 --> 08:24.296
No, 'cause I said so.

08:24.379 --> 08:26.423
He ain't what I smelled
at the mansion,

08:26.507 --> 08:29.593
and he could've wasted us both
just now, but he didn't.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.011
[cell phone rings]

08:32.095 --> 08:34.473
[Rogue] Jubilee? If you got
a hold of Wolverine,

08:34.556 --> 08:37.142
kindly invite him to join us
at the First National Bank.

08:37.226 --> 08:40.729
Police radio says it's being
robbed by somebody big.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.731
[police siren wailing]

08:44.858 --> 08:46.944
Glad you all decided
to join the party.

08:47.236 --> 08:49.279
So who busted the piggy bank?

08:49.363 --> 08:50.948
The police have
captured him.

08:51.031 --> 08:52.866
[Colossus] I was in the bank
to open an account.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.660
I tried to stop the robber.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.873
This guy's always
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

08:59.957 --> 09:01.500
He is not the one?

09:03.919 --> 09:05.629
Now that is a shame,

09:05.712 --> 09:08.757
locking up a big, good-looking
hunk-o-mutant like that.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.719
[police siren wailing]

09:16.765 --> 09:18.851
He said he confronted
the bank robber.

09:18.934 --> 09:20.310
Someone should talk to him.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.396
Twist my arm, Storm.

09:22.479 --> 09:24.439
Come on. Let's play
welcome wagon

09:24.523 --> 09:26.191
to tall, dark and Russian.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.110
[car engine starts]

09:30.320 --> 09:31.780
[Wolverine sniffs]

09:32.573 --> 09:35.033
[Wolverine] Same scent
that was at the mansion.

09:35.701 --> 09:36.827
We're close, Jubilee.

09:37.119 --> 09:40.163
All right! I think.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.456
Let's go.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.046
Now remember, Rogue,
no scenes.

09:48.422 --> 09:52.092
No scenes, sugar.
Just a little
down-home charm.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.889
You look a little
on the weary side, honey.

09:56.972 --> 09:58.432
Been a long shift?

09:58.515 --> 10:01.185
It was till you showed up.

10:01.268 --> 10:04.188
Ooh, it's a tad chilly
in here, don't you think?

10:04.563 --> 10:06.940
Like they say, cold hands...

10:08.567 --> 10:10.152
[screams]

10:11.111 --> 10:12.905
[Rogue] Out cold.
[chuckles]

10:17.784 --> 10:18.994
Your turn.

10:24.917 --> 10:28.086
[Colossus] I guess the police
think I must be the thief.

10:28.170 --> 10:29.630
[Beast speaking Russian]

10:29.713 --> 10:30.714
There he is.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.093
Dang! Wrong key.

10:36.803 --> 10:39.306
Hightail it, handsome.
We don't have much time.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.475
What? Who are you?

10:41.892 --> 10:44.061
[Beast] Angels of mercy,
my friend,

10:44.144 --> 10:47.064
known to those who love them
as Rogue and Storm.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.148
[both] Beast!

10:48.232 --> 10:50.943
[Beast] Eagerly awaiting
my day in court.

10:52.027 --> 10:54.613
By the way, our over-sized
Slavic friend

10:54.696 --> 10:56.240
is named Colossus.

10:56.782 --> 11:00.160
He swears he is innocent
of the crime for which
he stands accused.

11:00.244 --> 11:01.453
We believe him.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.706
We will need him to help us
find the real criminal.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.960
That's right. Care to join
the jail break, Beast?

11:08.043 --> 11:09.503
[alarm sounds]

11:09.586 --> 11:12.631
Thanks, no. But come back
during regular visiting hours,

11:12.714 --> 11:14.258
and we'll catch up on gossip.

11:14.341 --> 11:16.718
And tell Jean thanks
for the delicious cookies.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.888
Come on, big and pretty.
Let's make tracks.

11:19.972 --> 11:22.057
I cannot.
It is not permitted.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.142
[Beast speaking Russian]

11:24.226 --> 11:27.354
Trust my friends. They will
prove your innocence.

11:27.604 --> 11:28.814
Agreed, Beast.

11:28.897 --> 11:30.023
[Colossus speaking Russian]

11:30.107 --> 11:32.150
[Storm] Rogue, our way
is blocked.

11:32.401 --> 11:34.570
Give the boys
some air, Storm.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.366
[guards cry]

11:41.535 --> 11:44.121
Dear, dear, no back door.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.128
Now there's a back door.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.922
I just love it
when he does that.

11:55.632 --> 11:57.551
Hurry, Rogue,
they are coming.

12:01.555 --> 12:04.808
Arctic winds, make ice!

12:09.605 --> 12:11.148
[guards exclaiming]

12:15.319 --> 12:17.362
[alarm ringing]

12:26.330 --> 12:28.290
[people screaming]

12:30.334 --> 12:31.793
[sighs]

12:31.877 --> 12:35.297
The cool, refreshing smell
of mint.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.382
[laughing]

12:37.841 --> 12:40.677
[Wolverine] Storm? Rogue?
What's taking you so long?

12:41.053 --> 12:43.263
The guy's taking out
another bank.

12:43.347 --> 12:44.973
[Rogue] Be there
quick as a whip, hon.

12:45.057 --> 12:46.433
He's in there, isn't he?

12:46.517 --> 12:48.393
So what's taking this
big shot so long?

12:51.188 --> 12:52.523
Who's that?

12:52.856 --> 12:54.191
The Juggernaut.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.777
Stop or we'll shoot.

12:56.860 --> 13:00.197
Ooh, I'm scared.
I better run.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.823
[Juggernaut laughing]

13:01.907 --> 13:03.367
Open fire!

13:07.621 --> 13:09.289
Cease fire!

13:11.750 --> 13:14.795
Sticks and stones
will break my bones,

13:14.878 --> 13:17.214
but tanks will never hurt me.

13:17.631 --> 13:19.633
Now get out of my way.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.177
You're violating
my personal space.

13:23.762 --> 13:24.888
[Policeman] What the...

13:27.850 --> 13:29.351
[laughing]

13:31.103 --> 13:32.521
[grunting]

13:33.772 --> 13:35.858
I'm starting to get the idea.

13:36.108 --> 13:38.610
You wanted to fight the guy.
Come on.

13:42.573 --> 13:43.574
[whispers] Watch.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.040
My hand is quicker
than his eye.

13:56.128 --> 13:57.421
The rest is in the alley.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.423
Sorry, I can't explain.
Gotta run.

14:02.968 --> 14:07.055
Like they say, a fool
and his money are soon parted.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.267
[grunts angrily]

14:10.976 --> 14:12.853
So where's Xavier?

14:13.061 --> 14:14.104
[Juggernaut laughing]

14:14.188 --> 14:15.647
[growling]

14:16.940 --> 14:20.569
I knocked on his door,
but I don't think he was home.

14:24.489 --> 14:25.991
[groaning]

14:26.366 --> 14:28.911
So I decided to do
a little banking

14:28.994 --> 14:30.537
to get his attention.

14:32.623 --> 14:33.790
What's this?

14:33.999 --> 14:35.751
The 4th of July?

14:35.834 --> 14:37.628
No one told me.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.379
Leave him alone!

14:39.838 --> 14:41.882
[weakly] Jubilee, don't.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.134
[laughing]

14:44.301 --> 14:47.179
What's she gonna do,
hit me with her diaper?

14:47.554 --> 14:51.016
I'll show you,
you overgrown trash can!

14:53.936 --> 14:57.272
Somebody's getting too big
for her britches.

15:00.442 --> 15:01.902
Come out, come out,

15:01.985 --> 15:04.988
wherever you are.
 
What's going on? [screams]

15:08.784 --> 15:10.244
[laughs]

15:10.327 --> 15:13.205
You shouldn't have been
such a pest, girlie.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.289
No!

15:14.373 --> 15:16.542
[Rogue] Picking on kids,
big boy?

15:19.336 --> 15:24.216
How thoughtful.
The Professor sent me
more mutants to mangle.

15:24.675 --> 15:28.220
You! You robbed the bank
and left me to get the blame.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.639
How could you do this
to a fellow mutant?

15:31.682 --> 15:36.103
I'm not a mutant, tin-head.
My powers are magical,

15:36.186 --> 15:39.022
and none of you mutant wimps
can handle them.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.732
We will see.

15:45.737 --> 15:46.905
Come on.

15:54.872 --> 15:55.956
[grunts]

16:02.796 --> 16:06.633
I always crush my cans
before I throw them away.

16:10.262 --> 16:11.430
"Tank" you!

16:11.722 --> 16:15.142
Hmm, I wonder
if he's recyclable.

16:17.227 --> 16:18.645
Now what?

16:20.522 --> 16:21.690
Storm.

16:21.773 --> 16:25.277
Didn't my worthless brother
tell you it's no use?

16:36.955 --> 16:38.248
You killed him.

16:38.332 --> 16:40.626
Nothing we know of
can kill him.

16:40.709 --> 16:45.214
I'm trying to attack his mind,
but I can't get through.

16:45.589 --> 16:48.300
His helmet protects his mind
from probes.

16:49.051 --> 16:50.677
I've got an idea.

16:50.761 --> 16:54.765
It'll take all of us working
together for a change,

16:55.098 --> 16:56.308
but it just might work.

17:01.146 --> 17:03.232
[Juggernaut] Quit hiding,
you chickens.

17:05.192 --> 17:08.320
What's this,
baby cuddles again?

17:12.908 --> 17:15.118
Give me more. That tickles.

17:18.080 --> 17:20.582
Come on, you know
you can't hurt me.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.251
Give it a rest.

17:27.256 --> 17:28.841
Who turned out the lights?

17:35.889 --> 17:37.432
[Rogue grunting]

17:38.559 --> 17:40.894
What is this, tag team?

17:48.402 --> 17:49.444
Whoa!

17:52.614 --> 17:53.991
Nighty-night, big boy.

17:54.283 --> 17:55.742
I feel a tingle.

17:56.285 --> 17:58.036
Is this supposed to hurt?

17:58.120 --> 18:00.789
Just wait. You'll feel it
soon enough.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.336
And I think
Little Miss Cornpone

18:06.420 --> 18:08.172
is getting a taste
of what it's like

18:08.255 --> 18:11.216
to try to absorb my powers.

18:11.300 --> 18:15.220
Charles, you had it easy.
You were the good one!

18:15.762 --> 18:17.431
But now I'm the strongest,

18:17.514 --> 18:20.934
and I will destroy you
and your pathetic X-Men!

18:22.186 --> 18:24.271
[screaming]

18:24.354 --> 18:25.522
[Storm] Rogue!

18:27.024 --> 18:28.066
I have you.

18:28.150 --> 18:32.654
[Rogue screams]
 
Rogue, let it go! Let it go!

18:32.738 --> 18:34.198
[groaning]

18:34.281 --> 18:36.700
I gotta watch those
late night parties.

18:37.242 --> 18:42.748
[Jean] Juggernaut, mine
is the only voice you hear.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.667
[screams]

18:45.751 --> 18:49.755
Get away! Stop it!
I can't stand it!

18:53.091 --> 18:54.176
Stop it.

18:54.259 --> 18:56.428
[Jean groans]
[Cyclops] Jean.

18:58.222 --> 19:02.559
Agony. Evil thoughts.
They love my brother, not me.

19:02.643 --> 19:05.312
They love my brother.
Must destroy.

19:05.395 --> 19:08.232
Must... [screaming]

19:21.745 --> 19:22.746
What?

19:22.829 --> 19:26.166
You American girls,
strange girls.

19:29.086 --> 19:33.924
What are you staring at, kid?
Where the heck am I?

19:36.385 --> 19:38.846
Jean, please tell me
you're all right.

19:38.929 --> 19:41.181
As well as can be expected.

19:41.265 --> 19:42.724
[sighs]

19:42.808 --> 19:44.601
What did you do
to the Juggernaut?

19:44.685 --> 19:47.229
[Jean] I gave him
a hypnotic suggestion.

19:47.813 --> 19:50.858
He won't remember who he is
or what he was doing.

19:51.275 --> 19:52.860
[Jubilee] Totally excellent!

19:52.943 --> 19:54.653
The only problem is that
we don't know

19:54.736 --> 19:56.071
when it will wear off.

19:56.488 --> 19:58.073
[Wolverine] We'll be waiting
when it does.

19:58.156 --> 19:59.449
Maybe there's something

19:59.533 --> 20:03.287
to that wimpy "teamwork"
garbage of yours after all.

20:09.877 --> 20:12.045
Why don't you hang out
around here for a while?

20:12.129 --> 20:14.256
The Professor ain't here
to make it official,

20:14.339 --> 20:17.134
but take it from me,
you're always welcome.

20:17.217 --> 20:20.596
It is a great honor,
but I cannot do this now.

20:20.679 --> 20:25.017
I must first find my sister
and maybe see more of America.

20:25.100 --> 20:27.936
After I fix your house.

20:30.355 --> 20:32.900
I never realized how much
this dump meant to me

20:32.983 --> 20:34.943
till somebody wiped it out.

20:35.027 --> 20:38.405
Yeah, it's the first place
that ever really felt
like home.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.074
I know the Professor'd
like to hear you say that.

20:41.325 --> 20:44.661
[Jubilee] Don't worry,
Wolverine. We'll find him.
