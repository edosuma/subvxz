WEBVTT

00:21.422 --> 00:23.491
Emma.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.726
What are you doing?
Luca's asking for you.

00:25.726 --> 00:28.629
Sorry.
I just--I needed a break.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.698
This isn't an office job.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.368
Come on.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.446
Where the hell
have you been, huh?

00:45.446 --> 00:47.581
I've got a group of
financiers who want

00:47.581 --> 00:48.982
to meet my new American girl.

00:48.982 --> 00:51.352
Mr. Rossi, I'm not
really feeling well.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.653
Just relax, Emma.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.523
Drink, smile, flirt,
laugh at all their jokes.

00:57.024 --> 00:58.726
Make the right man happy,
and there is no limit

00:58.726 --> 01:00.861
on how successful
you can be in this business.

01:05.433 --> 01:06.534
Are you ready?

01:06.534 --> 01:07.735
Not really.

01:20.581 --> 01:23.884
Have another, my dear.

01:23.884 --> 01:27.421
<i>Bevi, bevi!</i>

01:27.421 --> 01:28.922
I'll be right back.

01:45.406 --> 01:47.141
Absolutely no way.

01:49.310 --> 01:50.511
You'd like that,
wouldn't you, huh?

01:54.348 --> 01:55.549
I despise you.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.494
Hey, Raffaella.

02:09.963 --> 02:10.798
I don't care.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.901
Tell him I got a headache.

02:13.901 --> 02:17.205
'Cause his breath smelled
like garlic and cigarettes.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.127
Uh, hey, what's going on?

02:42.896 --> 02:44.265
What is Dandridge doing here?

02:44.265 --> 02:45.466
He wants to talk to you.

02:45.466 --> 02:47.501
About what?
Wait, where's Forrester?

02:49.703 --> 02:51.004
Supervisor
in-service training.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.673
He was supposed
to be back today.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.007
Change of plans.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.476
We're extending
Agent Forrester's stay

02:55.476 --> 02:57.511
in Quantico for another
couple of weeks.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.947
You'll stay acting lead
until he returns.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.283
Would have appreciated
more of a heads up, but okay.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.884
One more thing.

03:03.884 --> 03:06.354
I want visibility
on all major decisions.

03:06.354 --> 03:09.557
All due respect, that's not
really how we operate.

03:09.557 --> 03:12.226
And I'm asking you to adjust.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.661
I want us all on the same page.

03:13.661 --> 03:15.663
We weren't before?

03:17.431 --> 03:18.599
Keep me looped in.

03:20.067 --> 03:22.202
Supervisor
in-service training?

03:22.202 --> 03:25.038
That sounds made up and boring.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.308
Forrester must be bouncing
off the walls over there.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.942
You think Dandridge
is trying to bench him?

03:28.942 --> 03:30.944
- I'd like to see him try.
- We caught something.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.881
Call just came in from
the U.S. consulate in Milan.

03:33.881 --> 03:36.817
Jocelyn Bell, 30,
American fashion model.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.686
Two nights ago
at an industry after-party,

03:38.686 --> 03:40.621
she took a header
off a penthouse balcony,

03:40.621 --> 03:42.089
eight stories high.

03:42.089 --> 03:43.991
The Italian police are
calling it a suicide,

03:43.991 --> 03:46.727
but there's another American
model who says different.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.962
Emma Staley, 20, Iowa girl.

03:48.962 --> 03:50.931
We've got a signed witness
statement from Emma

03:50.931 --> 03:52.766
saying she saw Jocelyn arguing

03:52.766 --> 03:54.402
with an unidentified
Italian man

03:54.402 --> 03:56.203
just a couple hours
before she died.

03:56.203 --> 03:57.571
- CCTV?
- Negative.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.773
CCTV cams were shut off
for the party.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.809
Still trying to find out why.
- What about social media?

04:01.809 --> 04:03.277
Plenty to comb through.

04:03.277 --> 04:05.379
Jocelyn's phone wasn't
recovered at the site, though.

04:05.379 --> 04:06.780
Well, that's a red flag.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.816
The venue was booked
by Luca Rossi,

04:08.816 --> 04:11.118
head of Ultima Models,
the agency that reps Emma.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.487
He also owns the penthouse
suite that Jocelyn was in

04:13.487 --> 04:14.655
right before the incident.

04:14.655 --> 04:16.223
I've heard of Rossi.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.191
Wild parties,
disreputable investors.

04:18.191 --> 04:19.927
He's had several
former clients come forward

04:19.927 --> 04:21.795
with allegations of abuse.

04:21.795 --> 04:23.931
Rumors are Rossi brokers dates

04:23.931 --> 04:26.133
between his models
and wealthy men.

04:26.133 --> 04:27.435
Nothing stuck, though.

04:27.435 --> 04:28.369
Everything's settled
out of court.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.837
Sounds like a charmer.

04:29.837 --> 04:32.172
Can you see about getting
our witness some protection?

04:32.172 --> 04:33.441
I'll make the call.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.942
You've all worked cases
in Italy?

04:34.942 --> 04:36.276
I haven't.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.245
You should know,
the Italian justice system

04:38.245 --> 04:40.147
is a bit baroque.

04:40.147 --> 04:41.482
It's inquisitorial.

04:41.482 --> 04:43.651
Public prosecutors lead
criminal investigations,

04:43.651 --> 04:44.685
not the police.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.019
Isn't that backwards?

04:46.019 --> 04:48.055
Like putting on shoes
before trousers.

04:48.055 --> 04:50.324
But when in Rome.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.273
Captain Ennio Sindona.

05:06.273 --> 05:07.908
Megan Garretson, Europol.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.944
These are Agents Kellett,
Vo, and Raines, FBI.

05:10.944 --> 05:12.380
Is the public prosecutor here?

05:12.380 --> 05:14.214
She'll meet you at the scene
of the incident.

05:14.214 --> 05:17.551
Also, your witness is
under protection, as asked.

05:17.551 --> 05:19.019
Thank you
for your cooperation.

05:19.019 --> 05:20.421
We'd like to speak with
Emma Staley as soon as po--

05:20.421 --> 05:21.622
Before that...

05:23.223 --> 05:25.125
May I have a word?
- Of course.

05:31.131 --> 05:34.334
I just want to make sure
you understand our position.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.504
This was a suicide.
- You're sure about that?

05:36.504 --> 05:40.140
Yeah, I've seen this before
with American girls.

05:40.140 --> 05:42.710
They come here
with big eyes, big dreams,

05:42.710 --> 05:45.446
and they end up
on the wrong path.

05:45.446 --> 05:48.048
It's tragic, but it happens.

05:48.048 --> 05:50.183
Emma Staley doesn't
think it was a suicide.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.085
Yes, your witness.

05:52.085 --> 05:55.623
About her, when my men
questioned Miss Staley,

05:55.623 --> 05:58.992
she was a bit unstable.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.261
What's that supposed to mean?

06:01.261 --> 06:03.096
Emma was... brillo.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.033
She had been drinking.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.469
Okay.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.503
Anything else?

06:13.941 --> 06:17.445
Captain, if Jocelyn Bell
was the victim of a crime,

06:17.445 --> 06:19.012
then she deserves justice.

06:19.012 --> 06:20.681
As police, we owe her that,

06:20.681 --> 06:22.683
regardless of what path
she was on.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.763
Emma's protection detail.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.600
She was crying.
She wasn't sad.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.401
She looked angry.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.471
Like she was having a fight
with her boyfriend.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.338
You think Jocelyn and
the man you saw her with

06:45.338 --> 06:46.406
were in a relationship?

06:47.841 --> 06:49.810
He called her stellina.

06:49.810 --> 06:52.513
It means "little star,"
a term of endearment.

06:52.513 --> 06:53.781
Did he grab her?

06:53.781 --> 06:55.082
Was he rough
with her in any way?

06:55.082 --> 06:56.316
No.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.118
No, they just went back
into the room.

06:58.118 --> 07:02.122
But--ah, it just doesn't
make any sense.

07:02.122 --> 07:04.157
I don't know what Jojo
was going through,

07:04.157 --> 07:07.094
but she didn't look suicidal.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.462
How long have you
been in Milan?

07:08.462 --> 07:10.030
Two months.

07:10.030 --> 07:13.000
I was back home in Des Moines
just posting on Instagram.

07:13.000 --> 07:17.304
Scout found me,
and now I'm here.

07:17.304 --> 07:20.273
Was being a model not
exactly how you pictured it?

07:20.273 --> 07:24.111
It's just--
there are parts of the job

07:24.111 --> 07:25.679
I didn't really know about.

07:25.679 --> 07:29.617
In Milan, the fashion houses,
magazines, designers,

07:29.617 --> 07:30.784
they don't matter.

07:30.784 --> 07:31.785
If you want to walk
the best shows

07:31.785 --> 07:33.086
and get the best spreads,

07:33.086 --> 07:35.255
you have to go
to these parties,

07:35.255 --> 07:36.790
make the moneymen happy.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.661
Bankers, investors, the VIPs.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.329
Luca calls it
"paying the bills."

07:42.329 --> 07:44.064
Luca Rossi, your agent?

07:46.867 --> 07:48.201
Emma, I know this is hard,

07:48.201 --> 07:49.970
but I have to ask you something.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.139
Has Rossi or anyone
at the agency

07:52.139 --> 07:55.943
ever forced you to do something
you didn't want to do?

07:55.943 --> 07:57.177
You mean like sex?

07:58.679 --> 07:59.780
No.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.314
What about Jocelyn?

08:01.314 --> 08:03.016
I don't know.
I didn't know her that well.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.586
Can you describe the man
you saw her with?

08:05.586 --> 08:08.556
He was tall, gray hair.

08:08.556 --> 08:09.990
He looked rich.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.826
What about his face?
Any distinguishing features?

08:12.826 --> 08:16.296
I don't know, um,
I think he had glasses.

08:18.666 --> 08:19.767
Actually, no.

08:19.767 --> 08:23.270
Um--let me think, I just--

08:27.641 --> 08:30.811
Emma, the night of the party,
did you have anything to drink?

08:30.811 --> 08:33.881
Um, just half a glass
of champagne.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.483
The Italian police say that
when they arrived on the scene,

08:36.483 --> 08:37.450
you were drunk.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.553
What?

08:39.553 --> 08:41.021
That's not true.

08:41.021 --> 08:43.390
They say
you were being erratic.

08:43.390 --> 08:46.827
A body hit a car literally
right in front of me.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.562
I mean, I was scared.

08:48.562 --> 08:51.131
I was kind of losing it,
but I was not drunk, okay?

08:51.131 --> 08:52.733
You have to believe me.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.035
We're just trying to gather
as much information as we can.

08:55.035 --> 08:57.537
Would you recognize
the man you saw Jocelyn with

08:57.537 --> 09:00.340
if we showed you some pictures,
faces of different men?

09:00.340 --> 09:01.341
Yeah.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.012
Do you think he pushed her?

09:05.012 --> 09:06.814
That's what we're
trying to find out.

09:06.814 --> 09:08.782
And while we do,
I think it'd be best

09:08.782 --> 09:10.517
if you stay here
in your apartment.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.319
I'm not going anywhere.

09:17.791 --> 09:19.092
Are you the Americans?

09:19.092 --> 09:20.994
Special Agent
Andre Raines, FBI.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.495
This is Megan Garretson, Europol.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.697
Brit.

09:23.697 --> 09:26.466
Nunzia Linari.
Public prosecutor.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.303
Luca Rossi's here,
per your request.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.740
He also brought his lawyer.
- Wait, you brought him here?

09:32.740 --> 09:34.675
Isn't this a crime scene?

09:34.675 --> 09:36.176
Crime scene?

09:36.176 --> 09:37.210
No.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.412
I haven't opened
an investigation.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.314
We don't see any evidence
of a criminal act.

09:41.314 --> 09:43.483
Hard to see what
you're not looking for.

09:45.418 --> 09:46.586
This way.

09:50.290 --> 09:51.759
Yes, I own it, but I don't
actually live here.

09:51.759 --> 09:52.993
Not full-time, anyway.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.195
I got a villa in Basiglio.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.731
Did you come down to the
suite during the party?

09:57.731 --> 09:59.366
No, I was playing host.

09:59.366 --> 10:01.234
Did you see anyone else
come down?

10:01.234 --> 10:05.906
I was attending to my guests,
not monitoring them.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.374
We'll need to see
that guest list.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.544
What was Jocelyn Bell
doing in your suite?

10:11.544 --> 10:14.081
I have no
earthly idea, you know?

10:14.081 --> 10:16.583
I gave up on accounting
for Jojo ages ago.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.285
She was spiraling.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.287
Becoming a liability,
drinking, drugs,

10:20.287 --> 10:22.122
racking up debts, boyfriends.

10:22.122 --> 10:23.991
Boyfriends you
set her up with?

10:23.991 --> 10:25.425
No charges have ever
been brought

10:25.425 --> 10:26.794
against Ultima Models
or Luca Rossi.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.161
Oh, I'm aware.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.763
And I remind you,
my client has agreed

10:29.763 --> 10:31.198
to this interview
as a courtesy.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.366
If you slander him,
that courtesy will be revoked.

10:33.366 --> 10:34.802
Understood?

10:34.802 --> 10:38.438
Why are you so sure that
Jocelyn killed herself?

10:39.773 --> 10:40.908
Two weeks ago, I told her

10:40.908 --> 10:42.042
I was gonna drop her
from my roster.

10:43.844 --> 10:47.480
Looking back, that was probably
what pushed her over the edge.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.150
My apologies.
Poor choice of words.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.552
We have a witness who doesn't
think it is suicide.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.187
Who?

10:54.187 --> 10:55.789
I'm not at liberty to say.

10:55.789 --> 10:56.790
Are you talking
about Emma Staley?

10:56.790 --> 10:58.191
Was she on her meds that night?

10:58.191 --> 10:59.927
- All right, that's enough.
- Hold on, I just have--

10:59.927 --> 11:01.528
If you have
any further questions,

11:01.528 --> 11:03.563
contact me directly.

11:03.563 --> 11:04.597
Luca.

11:08.635 --> 11:11.304
- You get anything?
- Not much. How about you?

11:11.304 --> 11:13.841
Housekeeping says the suite
was never sealed off

11:13.841 --> 11:15.208
after the body was discovered.

11:15.208 --> 11:17.210
At least a dozen people
came down from the party

11:17.210 --> 11:19.612
and passed through,
which means they probably

11:19.612 --> 11:21.081
walked out on the balcony.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.250
Which means the whole scene
is contaminated.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.218
Bang-up policework.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.820
Any word on Jocelyn's phone?

11:26.820 --> 11:28.989
They found a purse
in the suite, but no phone.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.758
Also, her service
was disconnected

11:30.758 --> 11:31.959
an hour after she died.

11:31.959 --> 11:33.460
What about security cams?

11:33.460 --> 11:36.429
No cameras in the suite,
but the rooftop CCTV system

11:36.429 --> 11:40.333
was switched off at the
express request of Luca Rossi.

11:40.333 --> 11:43.536
- Of course it was.
- One more thing.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.806
The sidewalk below
is about 10 feet wide.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.809
Jocelyn's body cleared it
and landed on the taxi.

11:48.809 --> 11:52.045
Just eyeballing it, but for
her to have landed there,

11:52.045 --> 11:53.246
a simple jump
wouldn't have cut it.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.815
She would have
needed a running start.

11:54.815 --> 11:59.286
Or someone launching her off.

11:59.286 --> 12:03.056
I don't think
this was a suicide.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.792
But without a witness...

12:09.696 --> 12:11.064
What about that renovation?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.800
What time do they
close up shop for the day?

12:12.800 --> 12:14.367
Checked that. 6:00 p.m.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.636
The workers were all gone
by the time the party started.

12:39.192 --> 12:42.062
- What do you want?
- Ah, splendid.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.331
My name is Megan Garretson,
I'm with Europol.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.066
I'm looking into the death
of an American girl.

12:46.066 --> 12:47.767
This was two nights ago.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.469
I didn't see anything.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.638
The thing is,
this incident happened

12:51.638 --> 12:52.705
across from your balcony.

12:52.705 --> 12:55.375
I said I did not see it.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.344
I don't have anything to say.

13:02.582 --> 13:04.818
My number is on
this card, Signora.

13:07.454 --> 13:09.189
In case you want to talk.

13:13.226 --> 13:15.495
Finally got the
autopsy results.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.664
The contusions on Jocelyn's
arms and shoulders

13:17.664 --> 13:19.566
are consistent
with a physical encounter.

13:19.566 --> 13:21.601
Could that have resulted
from the impact of the fall?

13:21.601 --> 13:23.236
Technically, yes.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.805
She's got defensive injuries on
her hands and fingers as well,

13:25.805 --> 13:28.708
but we can't tell whether
they happened at the party

13:28.708 --> 13:29.977
or sometime before.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.979
There's another issue.
Luca Rossi wasn't lying.

13:31.979 --> 13:34.447
Emma was diagnosed with bipolar
disorder seven years ago.

13:34.447 --> 13:36.383
She's talked about it
on social media.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.318
Unclear if she's currently
on any meds though.

13:38.318 --> 13:39.853
Without medication,
bipolar disorder

13:39.853 --> 13:42.956
can cause breaks in reality,
but that doesn't make

13:42.956 --> 13:44.324
Emma an unreliable witness.

13:44.324 --> 13:46.894
I don't know if
an Italian jury would agree.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.483
Emma.

14:20.593 --> 14:21.561
Emma?

14:24.331 --> 14:26.033
Are you in here?

14:47.921 --> 14:49.656
Any sign of her?

14:49.656 --> 14:51.491
She's gone.

14:59.799 --> 15:01.134
Emma didn't leave a note.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.570
She didn't take any of
her clothes or her meds.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.837
And her phone's disconnected.

15:04.837 --> 15:07.740
Just like Jocelyn's.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.109
You want to tell me
what happened here?

15:09.109 --> 15:11.244
We left and came back.
It was just a few minutes.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.613
You left?
Why the hell would you do that?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.448
Lunch break.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.649
I'm sure she's fine.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.218
She probably just
ran off somewhere.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.653
American girls in Italy
are like wild horses.

15:20.653 --> 15:21.754
Are you kidding?

15:21.754 --> 15:23.390
Calm down, please.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.691
You just lost our witness.

15:24.691 --> 15:25.892
She was nervous, scared.

15:25.892 --> 15:27.427
We told her to stay here.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.229
There is no way
she would have just run off.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.164
I think you are overreacting.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.299
It's only been
a couple of hours.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.034
She could come back
at any time.

15:34.034 --> 15:35.902
Just spoke to the shopkeeper
across the street.

15:35.902 --> 15:38.505
He said he saw Emma leave
with two men in dark suits.

15:38.505 --> 15:40.207
They were driving a black SUV.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.476
Let me guess,
this was around lunchtime?

15:45.478 --> 15:47.981
If I find out
this is anything more

15:47.981 --> 15:49.649
than you just being incompetent,

15:49.649 --> 15:51.484
you're gonna see
what overreacting

15:51.484 --> 15:53.420
actually looks like.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.094
No, I haven't heard from her.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.962
You don't seem too concerned.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.331
I'm not her babysitter.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.335
You're going
to another party?

16:08.335 --> 16:10.237
Luca wants us
working again tonight.

16:10.237 --> 16:13.006
It's part of the job,
and Luca always says,

16:13.006 --> 16:14.874
"Make the right man happy
and there's no limit

16:14.874 --> 16:16.443
to how successful you can be."

16:16.443 --> 16:19.546
Didn't seem to be working
for Jocelyn.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.349
Rossi was about to drop her
from his roster, wasn't he?

16:22.349 --> 16:24.417
It's a tough business.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.785
Not every girl makes it.

16:27.054 --> 16:29.189
You don't have a problem
with that?

16:29.189 --> 16:31.291
I'm from the south,
by Napoli.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.326
If you knew Italy,
you would know what that means.

16:35.162 --> 16:38.931
And believe me,
I'm not going back, ever.

16:38.931 --> 16:41.934
So if I have to go
to these parties and flirt

16:41.934 --> 16:44.371
and laugh with these old,
rich men, I'll do it.

16:44.371 --> 16:45.738
Is that it?

16:45.738 --> 16:47.340
Excuse me?

16:47.340 --> 16:50.009
Is that all Luca Rossi ever
made you do, flirt and laugh?

16:54.747 --> 16:56.083
What about Emma?

16:56.083 --> 16:57.817
Was she popular with the men
at these parties?

16:57.817 --> 16:59.919
Anyone specifically?

16:59.919 --> 17:02.489
Jojo was the one
everyone wanted.

17:02.489 --> 17:03.556
<i>La bella figura.</i>

17:03.556 --> 17:05.292
She got all the attention.

17:05.292 --> 17:06.793
She had a lot of boyfriends?

17:06.793 --> 17:08.461
Just one.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.164
It was his big secret,
so she never said his name,

17:11.164 --> 17:14.801
and he would take her
to places, buy her gifts.

17:14.801 --> 17:17.537
What kind of gifts?

17:17.537 --> 17:19.639
This is from an Ultima Model
social media page.

17:19.639 --> 17:23.310
Timestamp 1 hour and 36 minutes
before Jocelyn's death.

17:23.310 --> 17:25.512
Now, Raffaella said that
Jocelyn's secret boyfriend

17:25.512 --> 17:27.547
bought her this necklace.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.416
Makes sense because
it's a bespoke piece

17:29.416 --> 17:32.452
from an artisanal jeweler
on Via Monte Napoleone.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.721
Yellow gold and diamonds.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.823
Sticker price, 82,000 euros.

17:38.024 --> 17:39.626
It didn't get bagged
at the scene.

17:39.626 --> 17:42.929
Which means it must have come
off before she hit the taxi.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.331
Who's the gift giver?

17:44.331 --> 17:46.566
Walter Maldini,
an Italian hedge fund CEO.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.101
Purchased the necklace
six months ago.

17:48.101 --> 17:50.937
Maldini, really?

17:50.937 --> 17:53.206
- You know this guy?
- Europol knows him.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.007
He's one of the guys
who manages about 1 billion

17:55.007 --> 17:56.409
of the Vatican's assets.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.278
They call him
"The Holy Banker."

17:58.278 --> 18:00.513
We've been looking into him
for fraud and embezzlement.

18:00.513 --> 18:01.914
Well, it gets worse.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.783
Maldini has a history
of violence against women.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.518
I found seven
reported accusations

18:05.518 --> 18:06.819
of abuse and assault.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.221
Yeah, it all
bounces off, though.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.890
He always finds a way
to run out the clock,

18:10.890 --> 18:14.894
game the system, and he's still
widely respected in Italy.

18:14.894 --> 18:16.363
There's something else.

18:16.363 --> 18:18.965
Maldini ordered an engraving
on the necklace.

18:18.965 --> 18:21.534
<i>Per la mia stellina.</i>

18:21.534 --> 18:23.102
Little star.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.604
What Emma heard him
call Jocelyn.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.939
Right before he pushed her
off the balcony?

18:26.939 --> 18:28.675
Which I know we
cannot prove yet.

18:28.675 --> 18:30.843
But if Maldini
did kill Jocelyn

18:30.843 --> 18:32.612
and Emma can place him
at the scene,

18:32.612 --> 18:35.882
she's a threat, so we need
to find her, fast.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.317
Interesting.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.853
You Americans have a
strange understanding

18:40.853 --> 18:42.355
of the word "evidence."

18:42.355 --> 18:44.224
Maldini is a clear suspect.

18:44.224 --> 18:46.493
We have more than enough reason
to investigate him.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.027
For what?

18:48.027 --> 18:49.996
There are many ways to explain
what happened to that girl

18:49.996 --> 18:51.564
that don't involve foul play.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.300
He's a violent abuser,
and Jocelyn

18:53.300 --> 18:55.468
was in the same room with him
right before she died.

18:55.468 --> 18:57.270
I won't authorize
an investigation

18:57.270 --> 19:00.207
until I see real evidence that
a crime has been committed.

19:00.207 --> 19:03.109
Sometimes our job
is to uncover crimes,

19:03.109 --> 19:05.812
not just solve the ones
handed to us on a plate.

19:05.812 --> 19:07.514
You should give seminars.

19:11.017 --> 19:13.653
Something on your mind,
Captain?

19:13.653 --> 19:16.155
This isn't the first time
Maldini's name

19:16.155 --> 19:18.791
has come across my desk.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.561
I still think Jocelyn Bell
probably killed herself,

19:21.561 --> 19:26.633
but if Maldini was involved,
that complicates things.

19:26.633 --> 19:27.900
Unbelievable.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.669
It took some arm twisting,
but Luca Rossi

19:29.669 --> 19:31.604
sent over the guest list
for the party tonight.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.406
Maldini is on it.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.342
This guy thinks
he's untouchable.

19:35.342 --> 19:37.043
And that's how we find Emma.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.346
We'll get close,
we gain his confidence,

19:39.346 --> 19:40.680
and we get him talking.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.415
- How do we do that?
- I've got an idea.

19:45.885 --> 19:47.354
Hey.

19:48.755 --> 19:50.823
Can you print out copies
of the autopsy photos for me

19:50.823 --> 19:53.593
and put them in an envelope?
- Sure thing. What for?

19:53.593 --> 19:55.462
Just playing a hunch.

20:11.978 --> 20:14.681
Hello.

20:14.681 --> 20:15.682
<i>Signora.</i>

20:18.585 --> 20:20.553
I thought you might
want to see this.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.337
- We need your help, Raffaella.
- Please just leave me alone.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.639
I can't do that.
Emma is in trouble.

20:39.639 --> 20:41.508
She isn't just missing.
She was taken.

20:41.508 --> 20:43.343
I don't want to be involved.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.546
You already are involved.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.348
This isn't just about
Emma or Jocelyn,

20:48.348 --> 20:50.383
this is about every girl
who's been victimized here.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.684
You can't stand in the storm

20:51.684 --> 20:53.119
and pretend
you're not getting wet. -

20:53.119 --> 20:55.254
I said I don't want--
- Villagio Coppola.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.756
That's the village
you come from, right?

20:56.756 --> 20:59.191
10,000 people, tiny, poor?

21:00.393 --> 21:02.895
I know nothing
has been easy for you.

21:02.895 --> 21:03.963
You said you were just a girl

21:03.963 --> 21:04.897
when you first came here, right?

21:04.897 --> 21:06.899
Do you remember that girl?

21:06.899 --> 21:11.137
Don't you wish you could
go back and watch out for her?

21:11.137 --> 21:13.205
Protect her?

21:13.205 --> 21:15.608
That is what I'm asking you
to do right now.

21:15.608 --> 21:16.843
For Emma.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.684
What do you want?

21:24.684 --> 21:27.019
I know you need another
American girl for tonight,

21:27.019 --> 21:28.254
since Emma ran off.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.858
And?

21:31.858 --> 21:33.560
I've got a friend who just
moved here from New York.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.463
She's a model and she's
looking for representation.

21:38.765 --> 21:40.299
Hello, Mr. Rossi.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.645
- I'm in. Rossi bought it.
- Great.

21:52.645 --> 21:54.180
Raines, let's get
surveillance set up.

21:54.180 --> 21:56.449
Eyes and ears.

21:56.449 --> 21:59.552
We may have a problem.

21:59.552 --> 22:02.088
We have a problem.

22:02.088 --> 22:04.323
<i>Linari was livid
when I talked to her,</i>

22:04.323 --> 22:05.792
<i>and I don't blame her.</i>

22:05.792 --> 22:06.993
<i>You're circumventing
a public prosecutor</i>

22:06.993 --> 22:08.327
<i>who happens to be your host.</i>

22:08.327 --> 22:09.696
Things are moving fast.

22:09.696 --> 22:12.632
Also, circumventing
is a tad strong.

22:12.632 --> 22:15.468
We've been
intermittently sidestepping.

22:15.468 --> 22:17.470
<i>You're investigating
a highly prominent</i>

22:17.470 --> 22:20.773
<i>Italian citizen without having
checked the proper channels.</i>

22:20.773 --> 22:22.842
An American girl is missing,
another is dead,

22:22.842 --> 22:24.377
and we think
Maldini killed her.

22:24.377 --> 22:25.712
We have to investigate this.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.246
<i>I agree.</i>

22:27.246 --> 22:28.615
<i>Which is why I've
asked the Italians</i>

22:28.615 --> 22:30.149
<i>to give you more time.</i>

22:30.149 --> 22:31.784
<i>Linari has come around,
but whatever you need to do,</i>

22:31.784 --> 22:34.721
<i>I would do it fast because
her patience is running out.</i>

22:34.721 --> 22:35.888
<i>Now, why don't you
walk me through</i>

22:35.888 --> 22:37.356
<i>your next investigative steps?</i>

22:37.356 --> 22:38.758
We're still working
through our options.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.292
Nothing's imminent.

22:40.292 --> 22:42.294
<i>Whatever you decide on,
run it by me first.</i>

22:42.294 --> 22:43.430
Understood.

22:45.565 --> 22:46.933
Is it just me or--

22:46.933 --> 22:49.268
He's up to something.

22:49.268 --> 22:51.237
Let's finish
getting Vo prepped.

22:51.237 --> 22:53.840
I thought you said
nothing was imminent.

22:53.840 --> 22:56.042
I also said things
are moving fast.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.491
Can you hear me, Raines?

23:11.491 --> 23:13.159
Loud and clear.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.423
I've got eyes on Rossi.

23:46.459 --> 23:47.927
<i>Still blind on Maldini.</i>

23:51.631 --> 23:53.933
I've got eyes.
Your 10 o'clock.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.206
Stay close, okay?

24:02.709 --> 24:03.810
<i>I'm going in.</i>

24:08.280 --> 24:09.315
Mr. Maldini?

24:11.117 --> 24:12.919
- And who might you be?
- Alex.

24:12.919 --> 24:14.821
Mr. Rossi said I should
come talk to you.

24:14.821 --> 24:16.723
I'm one of his new girls.

24:16.723 --> 24:18.758
Why, yes, you are.

24:18.758 --> 24:20.026
New and fresh
like a pink spring lily.

24:20.026 --> 24:23.462
Thank you.

24:23.462 --> 24:24.797
First time in Milano?

24:24.797 --> 24:27.834
Yeah, I just arrived,
like, a week ago?

24:27.834 --> 24:30.469
And I don't really know
what I'm doing.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.071
Well, it's a big city.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.341
I'd be very happy
to show you around.

24:35.341 --> 24:37.777
If you like.
- Oh, that would be wonderful.

24:37.777 --> 24:39.478
Thank you so much, Mr. Maldini.

24:40.747 --> 24:42.314
Mm.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.717
It's just, I was supposed to be
staying with this girl Jojo.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.719
She's a model too.

24:46.719 --> 24:49.121
I mean, she was a model.

24:49.121 --> 24:52.424
I don't know if you heard,
but she killed herself.

24:52.424 --> 24:56.996
It's really sad, obviously,
but I don't feel like

24:56.996 --> 25:00.466
she was going to, you know.

25:00.466 --> 25:02.835
She seemed fine.

25:02.835 --> 25:05.004
Except for--

25:05.004 --> 25:07.574
Except for?

25:07.574 --> 25:08.741
What?

25:08.741 --> 25:09.942
I don't know if I should say.

25:14.380 --> 25:15.682
Signora.

25:15.682 --> 25:16.883
I'm sure her family
would appreciate

25:16.883 --> 25:19.552
any information
you could give them.

25:19.552 --> 25:21.788
Yes?

25:21.788 --> 25:24.090
She tell you something?

25:24.090 --> 25:25.491
Start reeling him in, Vo.

25:25.491 --> 25:26.626
<i>She was scared.</i>

25:26.626 --> 25:28.561
She had this boyfriend,

25:28.561 --> 25:30.863
and they were fighting,
like, all the time.

25:32.665 --> 25:34.433
I see.

25:34.433 --> 25:36.435
Does this boyfriend
have a name?

25:36.435 --> 25:37.904
Not that she told me,

25:37.904 --> 25:40.306
but I think
he was being abusive.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.542
And Jojo had proof.

25:45.912 --> 25:47.213
Proof?

25:48.881 --> 25:50.349
What proof?

25:50.349 --> 25:51.884
Recordings.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.886
I mean, he didn't know it,
but she recorded their fights.

25:53.886 --> 25:57.089
Him yelling at her,
hitting her.

25:57.089 --> 25:58.691
Perhaps we
should discuss this

25:58.691 --> 26:01.160
in a more private setting.

26:03.129 --> 26:05.231
Excuse me for a moment.

26:08.701 --> 26:10.169
<i>Good work.</i>

26:14.106 --> 26:15.875
Let's pull Raffaella now.

26:15.875 --> 26:16.776
Tell her to meet
Raines outside.

26:16.776 --> 26:17.810
On it.

26:22.248 --> 26:23.850
Let's go.

26:23.850 --> 26:25.417
Agent Cameron Vo.

26:27.053 --> 26:28.655
Welcome to the party.

26:28.655 --> 26:29.889
Thanks.

26:29.889 --> 26:32.524
I always wanted to meet
an FBI agent.

26:32.524 --> 26:36.228
Oh, you see my attorney
gave me the full lineup.

26:36.228 --> 26:38.530
He seems to be well informed.

26:38.530 --> 26:39.966
It's one of the perks
of having the GDP of Barbados

26:39.966 --> 26:41.000
in your bank account.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.569
That and Caspian Sea caviar.

26:43.569 --> 26:45.537
I am not here
for the fish eggs.

26:45.537 --> 26:50.276
I am here because you can't
seem to stop hurting women.

26:50.276 --> 26:53.913
If that were true,
I would not be meeting the Pope

26:53.913 --> 26:55.314
for breakfast on Tuesday.

26:55.314 --> 26:56.849
Well, why don't
we tell him about how

26:56.849 --> 26:58.985
you threw Jocelyn Bell
off a balcony

26:58.985 --> 27:00.920
and then see how he feels
about that?

27:03.690 --> 27:06.192
- Should we pull her out?
- No. She can handle this guy.

27:06.192 --> 27:07.459
<i>You American girls.</i>

27:10.362 --> 27:14.100
You got pretty mouth, but no
idea when to keep them shut.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.208
Where is Emma Staley?

27:22.208 --> 27:23.943
I know you took her.

27:29.916 --> 27:31.784
Emma Staley.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.319
Is that why you're here?

27:33.319 --> 27:35.221
What did you do with her?

27:35.221 --> 27:37.857
Oh, I showed her a good time.

27:50.669 --> 27:51.637
Emma.

28:02.281 --> 28:03.215
What are you doing here?

28:07.419 --> 28:09.488
- Are you okay?
- She's fine.

28:09.488 --> 28:11.223
She's here as my guest.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.892
Isn't that right, Emma?

28:18.097 --> 28:19.331
Vo, you've gotta get her out.

28:19.331 --> 28:20.733
<i>Bring her in.</i>

28:22.869 --> 28:25.537
- We're leaving. Let's go.
- No, I'm staying. I'm fine.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.638
Hey.

28:26.638 --> 28:28.808
Tell me what is going on.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.843
Are they hurting you?
Are they threatening you?

28:33.846 --> 28:35.748
I'm Mr. Maldini's guest.

28:35.748 --> 28:37.884
He came to pick me up
at my place.

28:37.884 --> 28:39.718
He said I need to get out
and have some fun.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.287
Maldini was with Jocelyn
that night.

28:41.287 --> 28:42.822
He's the man you saw, isn't he?

28:42.822 --> 28:44.857
No. I was mistaken.

28:44.857 --> 28:46.158
I didn't see anything.

28:46.158 --> 28:48.160
- Emma, you told--
- Just leave me alone.

28:48.160 --> 28:49.695
Agent Vo.

28:49.695 --> 28:51.831
I'm Robert Baldwin,

28:51.831 --> 28:54.700
Miss Staley's
legal representative.

28:54.700 --> 28:56.235
Why do you need a lawyer?

28:56.235 --> 28:58.237
Well, Ms. Staley is concerned
about her involvement--

28:58.237 --> 28:59.605
I wasn't talking to you.

28:59.605 --> 29:00.907
From now on,
please direct any questions

29:00.907 --> 29:02.842
you have for my client to me.

29:02.842 --> 29:05.044
So you can control
everything she says.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.413
Emma,
if they are controlling you,

29:07.413 --> 29:09.315
if they are hurting you,
we can--

29:09.315 --> 29:10.783
What's all the commotion?

29:10.783 --> 29:16.422
Agent Vo, meet my wife,
Chiara Maldini.

29:20.292 --> 29:22.394
<i>Just an unfortunate misunderstanding.</i>

29:22.394 --> 29:24.130
Is that what I think it is?

29:24.130 --> 29:25.464
Zoom in on it.

29:25.464 --> 29:26.765
<i>We'll get this
all cleared up.</i>

29:26.765 --> 29:28.801
<i>You'll see, amore.</i>

29:28.801 --> 29:30.937
Jocelyn's necklace.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.372
Unreal.

29:33.372 --> 29:38.310
The FBI is investigating
suicide, isn't it?

29:40.112 --> 29:42.514
Oh, the American girl
who jumped off the building?

29:42.514 --> 29:45.751
Jocelyn, that was her name.

29:45.751 --> 29:47.954
But your husband
called her stellina.

29:47.954 --> 29:49.956
It's inscribed on that necklace
you're wearing,

29:49.956 --> 29:52.859
because he bought it
for her first.

29:52.859 --> 29:58.464
The, um, agent here seems
to think I knew this girl?

29:58.464 --> 30:00.066
I was with her at the party.

30:00.066 --> 30:02.068
How odd.

30:02.068 --> 30:04.103
I can assure you
that this necklace

30:04.103 --> 30:06.973
has never touched
another woman's skin.

30:06.973 --> 30:09.675
And Walter,
he didn't go to that party.

30:09.675 --> 30:13.045
He was with me
at home all night.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.317
Anyway, the poor thing.

30:19.919 --> 30:24.023
As Dante wrote, "O human race,
born to fly upward,

30:24.023 --> 30:29.395
wherefore at a little wind
dost thou so fall?"

30:34.566 --> 30:36.368
Try some caviar
before you leave.

30:40.472 --> 30:41.707
Emma.

30:44.911 --> 30:46.745
The public prosecutor
is on her way.

30:46.745 --> 30:47.880
She's going to send you home.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.115
Maldini called her.

30:49.115 --> 30:50.616
He is lodging a
formal complaint

30:50.616 --> 30:52.218
against me and the FBI.

30:52.218 --> 30:53.119
He did it.

30:53.119 --> 30:54.486
I mean, he killed Jocelyn.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.222
I saw it in his eyes.

30:56.222 --> 30:57.890
Are we just gonna
let him get away with it?

30:57.890 --> 30:59.791
Unless you can show Linari
direct evidence

30:59.791 --> 31:01.360
that a crime
has been committed,

31:01.360 --> 31:02.895
I don't see what we can do.

31:10.469 --> 31:11.537
We bring Emma in.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.405
Are you serious?

31:13.405 --> 31:15.074
She's already recanted.

31:15.074 --> 31:16.308
She signed a
witness statement.

31:16.308 --> 31:17.910
Let's bring her in
and hold her to it.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.078
Do you realize what
you're asking of me?

31:19.078 --> 31:20.379
It could end my career.

31:20.379 --> 31:24.583
Captain, you know
Maldini did this.

31:24.583 --> 31:28.387
So be a moral cop right now.

31:28.387 --> 31:31.757
Do your job
and let's take this guy down.

31:36.862 --> 31:39.731
Signora, I need
to talk with you.

31:42.601 --> 31:44.770
I know you saw what happened
to that girl.

31:44.770 --> 31:48.307
You might be the only person
who saw it.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.509
The man who did it
is gonna keep hurting girls.

31:50.509 --> 31:51.978
I need your help.

31:53.879 --> 31:56.915
Signora, please open the door.

32:26.778 --> 32:28.014
Where you been?

32:28.014 --> 32:30.182
I believe you Yanks
call it a Hail Mary.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.584
- Any luck?
- No. What's going on?

32:34.586 --> 32:35.988
We brought Emma back in.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.923
Vo is with her now,
trying to flip her back,

32:37.923 --> 32:40.192
get her to place Maldini
at the scene.

32:40.192 --> 32:41.660
What if she doesn't?

32:48.500 --> 32:53.339
Like I said, Mr. Maldini
sent a car to pick me up.

32:53.339 --> 32:56.408
He's taken an interest
in my career,

32:56.408 --> 32:57.709
and he's putting me up
at his house

32:57.709 --> 33:00.879
while we discuss opportunities
beyond modeling.

33:00.879 --> 33:03.082
If that's true,
then why can't you look at me?

33:05.284 --> 33:08.654
Emma, look at me.

33:13.159 --> 33:14.326
Please.

33:15.761 --> 33:17.829
I'm telling you the truth.

33:24.070 --> 33:25.871
All right, enough.

33:25.871 --> 33:27.639
You signed a witness statement
saying that

33:27.639 --> 33:30.709
you saw Jocelyn Bell
arguing with a man

33:30.709 --> 33:32.611
just minutes before she died.

33:32.611 --> 33:34.046
Is this the man you saw?

33:34.046 --> 33:35.214
She already told you
she was mistaken--

33:35.214 --> 33:36.415
I'm not talking
to you right now.

33:36.415 --> 33:37.683
Actually, you are.
As her lawyer--

33:37.683 --> 33:40.352
Jocelyn had a family, Emma,

33:40.352 --> 33:42.588
and they're never gonna
see her again.

33:42.588 --> 33:44.056
And you know what
the worst part is?

33:44.056 --> 33:45.391
Not knowing.

33:45.391 --> 33:47.459
Not knowing what
really happened.

33:47.459 --> 33:50.996
And if you don't do
the right thing right now,

33:50.996 --> 33:56.001
they're never gonna know that
she was murdered by this man.

33:57.903 --> 34:01.807
Tell me what
you saw that night.

34:05.844 --> 34:07.646
Doesn't matter what I saw.

34:09.348 --> 34:11.717
That night,
the night of the party...

34:15.554 --> 34:17.356
I wasn't on my medication.

34:26.598 --> 34:27.999
It's not true, obviously.

34:27.999 --> 34:29.601
Maldini has to be
threatening her somehow.

34:29.601 --> 34:30.969
That's not the point.

34:30.969 --> 34:32.504
She just admitted
to not being on her meds

34:32.504 --> 34:33.905
in front of witnesses.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.607
Even if we can convince her
to tell the truth,

34:35.607 --> 34:37.843
a defense lawyer will rip
her apart on the stand now.

34:37.843 --> 34:39.745
It would never get that far.

34:39.745 --> 34:42.114
Linari would throw the
statement out first thing.

34:42.114 --> 34:45.517
What then? Maldini walks?

34:45.517 --> 34:47.519
Hold on.
There must be something else.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.658
Who is it?

34:52.658 --> 34:54.526
My Hail Mary.

34:57.296 --> 34:58.630
Signora?

35:02.634 --> 35:04.136
You're gonna
come in or not?

35:11.410 --> 35:13.979
I see you got
my final package.

35:15.547 --> 35:18.717
I have been alone
for a long time.

35:18.717 --> 35:21.187
At this age,
you don't need much.

35:21.187 --> 35:24.623
A nice view, good chair.

35:24.623 --> 35:30.729
Most nights I sit
and I watch the world go by.

35:30.729 --> 35:33.965
It doesn't sound very exciting,

35:33.965 --> 35:38.003
but you would be surprised
at the things I have seen.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.542
Why haven't you wanted
to talk with me before?

35:43.542 --> 35:45.711
You are not from here.

35:46.812 --> 35:48.814
It's hard to explain.

35:51.116 --> 35:54.420
When I was a girl,
my older sister

35:54.420 --> 35:57.323
wanted to leave her husband.

35:57.323 --> 36:02.794
Before she could do it,
my father found out.

36:02.794 --> 36:08.467
He said that my sister
had disgraced his name.

36:08.467 --> 36:12.971
Papa hit her so many times,

36:12.971 --> 36:16.342
she was in the hospital
for two months.

36:16.342 --> 36:20.479
Was this when honor killings
were still legal?

36:20.479 --> 36:21.813
Nothing happened to him.

36:21.813 --> 36:25.050
We went to mass the next day.

36:25.050 --> 36:28.220
This is how it has
always been here.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.822
And nothing will change

36:30.822 --> 36:32.724
unless you do something
about it.

36:36.127 --> 36:37.629
Is this his wife?

36:41.132 --> 36:46.204
He put that girl's necklace
on his own wife?

36:46.204 --> 36:47.839
Yes, he did.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.040
After he killed her.

36:50.976 --> 36:54.880
Signora, I know it's difficult,
but the way this world is,

36:54.880 --> 36:58.517
sometimes we have to do more
than just sit and watch.

37:04.256 --> 37:07.626
They have been working
on this building for months.

37:09.461 --> 37:13.799
An old place like this
needs repair all the time.

37:13.799 --> 37:17.168
The men keep taking
their breaks on my balcony,

37:17.168 --> 37:18.737
smoking their cigarettes.

37:18.737 --> 37:23.409
I tried to make them stop,
but they wouldn't.

37:23.409 --> 37:28.347
So the landlord,

37:28.347 --> 37:30.416
he put this here.

37:36.855 --> 37:38.757
And this was recording
the night of the party?

37:38.757 --> 37:40.826
Everything it records.

37:40.826 --> 37:43.762
Goes straight to the clouds,
he said.

38:03.014 --> 38:04.550
I know we have a
different understanding

38:04.550 --> 38:06.385
of the word "evidence, but...

38:22.100 --> 38:24.403
You know what else
Dante wrote?

38:24.403 --> 38:26.338
"Hope not ever to see heaven.

38:26.338 --> 38:31.242
"I have come to lead you
to the other shore

38:31.242 --> 38:33.679
into eternal darkness."

38:45.857 --> 38:48.760
Thank you for everything.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.629
I really thought
he was gonna hurt me.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.230
You're safe now.

38:53.499 --> 38:54.833
I'm going home.

38:54.833 --> 38:56.535
Going back to school.

38:56.535 --> 38:59.371
I think I'm gonna take a break
from the fashion world.

38:59.371 --> 39:00.906
For a while, at least.

39:02.374 --> 39:04.142
How about you?

39:04.142 --> 39:06.378
I'm testifying
against Luca Rossi.

39:06.378 --> 39:09.415
I won't him hurt me again,
or anyone else.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.751
I'm glad to hear that.

39:12.751 --> 39:15.887
I don't know what's going to
happen, but you were right.

39:15.887 --> 39:18.089
It's time to face the storm.

39:20.091 --> 39:21.059
Ready?

39:31.002 --> 39:32.971
The public prosecutor
has opened

39:32.971 --> 39:35.106
a criminal investigation
against Maldini.

39:35.106 --> 39:36.642
Good.

39:36.642 --> 39:38.444
I hear you're looking into
Luca Rossi and Ultima Models?

39:38.444 --> 39:41.312
That's right.
Trafficking and prostitution.

39:41.312 --> 39:43.882
Should be a simple case.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.017
You know, you're actually
pretty good at it.

39:46.017 --> 39:48.554
- At what?
- Being a cop.

40:16.482 --> 40:18.584
It is a nice view.

40:18.584 --> 40:20.118
What do you think we'll see?

40:22.988 --> 40:25.991
Usually,
when I sit here at night,

40:25.991 --> 40:28.393
there is less talking.

40:28.393 --> 40:30.496
Oh.

40:30.496 --> 40:31.497
Understood.

40:33.331 --> 40:34.533
<i>Salute.</i>

40:36.768 --> 40:39.270
<i>Per lei, Signora.</i>
