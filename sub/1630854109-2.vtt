WEBVTT

00:17.318 --> 00:18.952
Swipe right on your break.

00:19.053 --> 00:21.889
If you go faster, we may
actually get to take one.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.738
Hey.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.341
Stop, stop, stop!

00:50.884 --> 00:53.187
You were supposed
to drain all the fluids.

00:53.287 --> 00:55.589
The car was prepped. I swear.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.079
Coffee?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.417
Looks like you need it
more than I do.

01:23.517 --> 01:26.520
Just need to get
my day going.

01:27.355 --> 01:29.056
You sound like your dad.

01:29.157 --> 01:30.358
I am his son.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.993
He's also middle-aged.

01:34.995 --> 01:37.165
Okay, why are you
so worn-out?

01:37.265 --> 01:39.032
I'm middle-aged, apparently.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.434
Seriously, Alex,
what is it?

01:40.534 --> 01:43.103
College apps?
SAT prep? Homework?

01:43.204 --> 01:45.873
Oh, I'm getting tired
just hearing all of it.

01:45.973 --> 01:48.075
Fall semester
of senior year is tough.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.012
I'm glad you feel
that way.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.518
Mrs. Allen wants you
to sign it.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.754
And acknowledge
that you got a "C"

02:00.854 --> 02:02.190
in a subject you usually ace?

02:02.290 --> 02:03.491
C-plus.

02:03.591 --> 02:04.492
Okay, what happened?

02:04.592 --> 02:05.959
Mom, it's one paper.

02:06.059 --> 02:08.162
It's not like I'm on drugs
or getting arrested.

02:08.262 --> 02:10.564
So, can you just
sign it, please?

02:12.566 --> 02:15.236
You sure nothing else
is going on?

02:15.336 --> 02:18.939
Because <i>Jane Eyre</i>
is a classic.

02:19.740 --> 02:22.310
It's a gothic coming-of-age
story about a young woman,

02:22.410 --> 02:23.977
like, finding herself.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.546
And you didn't see
any parallels?

02:25.646 --> 02:28.081
Clearly not.

02:28.182 --> 02:29.550
Won't happen again.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.922
Hey, boss.
Hey.

02:35.022 --> 02:37.991
Our victim is Marine
Staff Sergeant Travis Cobb.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.394
Workers found him
in the back of a sedan

02:40.494 --> 02:41.629
as they were crushing it.

02:41.729 --> 02:43.030
Would've been tough
to I.D. him,

02:43.130 --> 02:45.466
except he had his dog
tags tucked in his boot.

02:45.566 --> 02:47.501
It's a Marine thing.

02:47.601 --> 02:48.636
Is that the car?

02:48.736 --> 02:50.170
Yeah.
A few more seconds

02:50.271 --> 02:52.406
and Cobb would've been crushed
and missing forever.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.741
Anyone report him missing?

02:53.841 --> 02:55.008
His C.O. put him on

02:55.108 --> 02:57.077
unauthorized absence
status yesterday.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.646
And he ended up here?

02:58.746 --> 03:00.414
Car was empty when it
was prepped for disposal,

03:00.514 --> 03:02.115
two days ago, so our theory is

03:02.216 --> 03:05.553
he was killed and dumped
at night during off-hours.

03:05.653 --> 03:06.954
Do we know the cause of death?

03:07.054 --> 03:08.389
No, not yet.

03:08.489 --> 03:10.391
But we're really hoping
it wasn't from the crushing.

03:10.491 --> 03:12.192
Talk about
nightmare fuel.

03:12.293 --> 03:13.961
All right, Kai,
when we're finished here,

03:14.061 --> 03:15.796
follow up with Chase
for an answer.

03:15.896 --> 03:17.431
Yeah, yeah,
I got it, boss.

03:17.531 --> 03:18.866
:
Thank you.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.335
Doesn't look like they're
running any CCTV.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.937
We have any other leads on
who might have dumped the body?

03:24.037 --> 03:25.105
This place is on

03:25.205 --> 03:27.275
a suburban
home security package.

03:27.375 --> 03:29.410
Spare key in a fake rock,

03:29.510 --> 03:30.944
"Beware of Dog" sign
with no dog,

03:31.044 --> 03:33.747
and all the employees
have alibis.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.284
What would a young
marine be doing

03:36.384 --> 03:38.018
to get dumped
in a junkyard?

03:38.118 --> 03:40.053
It's the stuff you see
with mobsters and criminals.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.522
According to his C.O.,

03:41.622 --> 03:43.524
he couldn't be further
from either.

03:43.624 --> 03:46.860
Said he was a good marine
with a good heart.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.497
Maybe his C.O. didn't
really know him.

03:52.666 --> 03:54.902
Thank you so much, Annie.

03:58.772 --> 04:01.609
Oh, I think word's gotten
out about this place.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.978
But, hey, waiting
can be fun. Right?

04:05.078 --> 04:06.880
Yeah. Totally.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.183
I'm sorry,
I just thought

04:10.284 --> 04:13.387
supplying our respective
teams with caffeine fixes

04:13.487 --> 04:15.823
is sort of
our thing now.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.726
I want to tell my boss
we're dating.

04:20.694 --> 04:22.496
Say something.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.632
I'm just, we, uh...

04:24.732 --> 04:26.099
We were, we were on coffee,

04:26.199 --> 04:28.135
and now we're-we're on-on
talks with bosses.

04:28.235 --> 04:29.870
Well, there's
an FBI barbecue coming up,

04:29.970 --> 04:32.205
and I want you
to come with me.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.876
Okay. Yeah, same page now.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.611
I-I think you should
totally tell your boss

04:37.711 --> 04:40.348
so... I can meet your team.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.049
This is great.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.252
Yeah, it is.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.789
Okay, so then why does it
seem like you're worried?

04:49.990 --> 04:53.694
He could take me off
as NCIS liaison.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.097
No, he wouldn't do that.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.500
Would he?

05:00.300 --> 05:03.637
Uh, if he felt like there was
a conflict of interest.

05:09.977 --> 05:13.614
Shoot. I, um, I-I have
to run to K-Bay.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.718
I think you're doing
the right thing.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.756
It's gonna be okay. Really.

05:35.703 --> 05:37.738
Oh, yes, you're done.

05:42.610 --> 05:43.877
Okay, never mind.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.279
Sometimes it can be
a sobering reminder:

05:46.380 --> 05:48.482
how fragile
our physical forms are.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.251
Don't get me wrong,
I-I've seen many physical forms.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.252
I'm just...

05:52.352 --> 05:54.655
Crushed in a car is new.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.457
You never forget your firsts.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.725
Like the time I went to examine

05:57.825 --> 05:59.593
a body flattened by
a plane wheel.

05:59.693 --> 06:02.095
Quite literally, like a pancake.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.297
Couldn't eat breakfast
for a week.

06:05.566 --> 06:06.967
Right.

06:07.067 --> 06:09.670
So, uh, given the state
of this physical form,

06:09.770 --> 06:12.940
were you able to learn...

06:13.040 --> 06:14.642
just... well, anything?

06:14.742 --> 06:17.210
Postmortem examination can be
revealing in any circumstance.

06:17.310 --> 06:18.779
For example,

06:18.879 --> 06:21.749
the liquid oozing from the car
wasn't all blood, per se,

06:21.849 --> 06:23.584
since our marine
bled quite a bit

06:23.684 --> 06:25.786
before his body
was dumped.

06:25.886 --> 06:28.021
So, what was it?
Organs.

06:28.121 --> 06:31.058
Decomposing and crushed
in the vehicle.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.528
I was also able to
identify time of death

06:34.628 --> 06:36.329
as roughly 33 to 35 hours ago.

06:36.430 --> 06:39.166
And then there's the evidence
of how he died.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.168
May have been
crushed and broken,

06:41.268 --> 06:42.836
but the pieces
were there.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.138
Well, most of them.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.840
Part of the back
of the skull is missing.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.976
As well as
the incisors.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.377
This, unfortunately,

06:50.478 --> 06:52.379
is not my first
gunshot wound to the face.

06:52.480 --> 06:55.082
Any other
signs of struggle?
That's harder to tell.

06:55.182 --> 06:56.917
But there was something else.

06:57.017 --> 06:59.687
I found trace evidence
of a unique chemical compound

06:59.787 --> 07:01.755
in his sinuses and lungs.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.023
Do you know what it is?

07:03.123 --> 07:05.693
Not something I'm familiar with.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.996
Sorry. It's cold.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.031
It's all right.
Doing your job.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.033
Are the leads warm, at least?

07:13.133 --> 07:15.068
Nobody I talked to at K-Bay
knew where Cobb went

07:15.168 --> 07:16.637
the night he was murdered,
who he was with,

07:16.737 --> 07:19.239
or why he had a weird
chemical in his lungs. Okay.

07:19.339 --> 07:20.974
Did they have anything else
to say about him?

07:21.074 --> 07:22.810
I did learn he was from Daytona.

07:22.910 --> 07:25.212
Had no nonjudicial punishment.

07:25.312 --> 07:26.880
And he also brought
doughnuts to work

07:26.980 --> 07:28.516
at the motor pool
every Monday.

07:28.616 --> 07:30.951
So the leads are colder
than the coffee. Except...

07:31.051 --> 07:33.286
in spite of a bright future
with the Marine Corps,

07:33.386 --> 07:34.788
he was getting out.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.791
Any word on
where he was going?
Never submitted

07:37.891 --> 07:39.326
for travel orders
back to the mainland.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.829
Maybe he was staying here.
I mean, it makes sense.

07:41.929 --> 07:43.664
Everybody I talked to
assumed Cobb had

07:43.764 --> 07:47.601
an entire life outside of K-Bay
that he just never talked about.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.770
A life that led
to his murder.

07:49.870 --> 07:53.440
But do we have any ideas on what
he might have been mixed up in?

07:53.541 --> 07:55.909
Drugs, reckless behavior?

07:56.009 --> 07:57.645
Never popped positive
or arrested.

07:57.745 --> 07:59.079
He was squeaky clean.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.481
But, yeah, he had to have been
staying for something.

08:01.582 --> 08:02.783
Can't just be the palm trees.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.885
Maybe it was for someone.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.794
Hey, Ernie,
any update on the... Shh.

08:13.894 --> 08:15.829
Representative.

08:16.897 --> 08:19.432
:
Representative.

08:22.202 --> 08:23.671
Trying to get Cobb's
cell phone records?

08:23.771 --> 08:25.238
Sorry about that.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.474
I got his call log,
but I've been in automated hell

08:27.575 --> 08:28.976
trying to access more.

08:29.076 --> 08:30.944
You should've seen when I tried
to dispute a hidden fee.

08:31.044 --> 08:32.345
They broke me
like a bad habit.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.081
Well, usually I'd be
dealing with Caroline,

08:34.181 --> 08:35.783
but she went on her honeymoon
in Turks and Caicos.

08:35.883 --> 08:38.085
Anyway, here's what
else I got on Cobb.

08:38.185 --> 08:40.954
He didn't post much
on social media,

08:41.054 --> 08:43.591
but he was following
412 car accounts, literally.

08:43.691 --> 08:44.992
And bank records show

08:45.092 --> 08:47.294
a bunch of transactions
at auto retailers.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.162
It's not surprising
he was into cars.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.831
He worked
in the motor pool.

08:50.931 --> 08:52.232
But what about
a significant other?

08:52.332 --> 08:54.768
There's one 808 number
that comes up a lot.

08:54.868 --> 08:56.169
And if I could
just get off hold,

08:56.269 --> 08:58.005
I'll be able to find out
who it belongs to.

08:58.105 --> 08:59.539
Thank you for waiting.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.410
Hi, this is Ernie Malik
from NCIS.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.246
No, no, I usually speak
with Caroline.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.116
Oh, I know.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.019
I know. She's so much
better off with Dan.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.855
I got her the griddler.
The stand mixer was taken.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.890
You?

09:16.990 --> 09:19.059
Oh, my. Sneaky.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.361
I know. Caroline is the best.

09:21.461 --> 09:24.698
So if you could just
unlock those records.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.333
Mahalo.

09:26.433 --> 09:27.701
Yes!

09:27.801 --> 09:30.503
Dude, the griddler?
It was on her registry.

09:30.604 --> 09:31.705
Oh, look.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.506
808 number belongs
to a Lani Jones.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.842
Girlfriend theory tracks.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.176
All right.
Can you get me her address?

09:36.276 --> 09:38.511
Of course, but I can
do you one better.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.016
Lani's phone pinged there
moments ago.

09:43.116 --> 09:44.151
Nice.

09:44.251 --> 09:46.754
Griddler for the win. Bruddah.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.172
You sure this is
the right place?

10:05.272 --> 10:08.141
I mean, uh,
give or take.

10:08.241 --> 10:09.910
There's not much else
around here.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.544
Not much here.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.947
Looks like an old airfield.

10:14.047 --> 10:15.749
Place like this is
supposed to be off-limits.

10:15.849 --> 10:19.152
Yeah, well, according to
the records Ernie forwarded,

10:19.252 --> 10:21.054
both Cobb and his girlfriend's
phones have pinged

10:21.154 --> 10:23.490
in this location a bunch
of times in the recent past.

10:23.590 --> 10:24.658
Why, though?

10:24.758 --> 10:26.359
I mean, if they
were teenagers,

10:26.459 --> 10:28.662
this could be like
some make out spot.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.397
Oh, yeah? You and your
high school sweetheart

10:30.497 --> 10:32.232
make out at a lot of airfields?

10:32.332 --> 10:35.869
Great Falls Overlook
on the Potomac, actually.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.038
Yeah, that's romantic.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.546
You hear that?

11:00.994 --> 11:02.162
So which one are you
gonna follow?

11:02.262 --> 11:03.596
The Challenger has 800 horses

11:03.697 --> 11:06.466
and a finely tuned 350Z
maybe 500, 600?

11:08.736 --> 11:10.003
All right, 350Z?
What?

11:10.103 --> 11:11.104
No, the Challenger.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.439
It may have
more horsepower,

11:12.539 --> 11:14.041
but it's also like
800 pounds heavier.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.946
Guess we're going with
the 350Z after all.

11:24.885 --> 11:25.853
What's the plan?

11:25.953 --> 11:27.454
Not really sure. Improvising.

11:27.554 --> 11:29.957
Yeah, says the guy driving
straight toward another car!

11:33.026 --> 11:34.561
Ooh.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.244
Pretty reckless,
don't you think?
Yeah.

11:51.344 --> 11:55.182
How'd you do that J-turn
at that speed, anyway?

11:55.282 --> 11:56.649
Fast hands.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.952
So loosen your grip
and trust you won't crash.

11:59.052 --> 12:00.287
Cool.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.688
Hey.
What?

12:01.789 --> 12:03.456
You do know it's illegal

12:03.556 --> 12:05.092
to street race
on the island, right?

12:05.192 --> 12:07.627
First off all,
not technically on a street.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.696
Okay? And secondly,
cops tend to ignore us.

12:09.797 --> 12:11.631
Long as we're not
bothering anybody.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.334
We're not the cops. We're NCIS.

12:14.434 --> 12:16.036
We're looking for Lani Jones.

12:16.136 --> 12:18.038
You found her.

12:18.972 --> 12:21.608
When was the last time
you saw Travis Cobb?

12:31.384 --> 12:34.154
I-I thought he got
called into training.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.958
Sometimes he can't talk
for a couple days.

12:40.127 --> 12:42.062
How'd you two meet?

12:42.162 --> 12:43.897
On the track.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.399
My family's
been involved

12:46.499 --> 12:48.101
with racing...

12:48.201 --> 12:51.171
pretty much since the first
car landed on the island.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.040
And Cobb?

12:54.942 --> 12:56.944
Thought he was just another
military kine guy

12:57.044 --> 13:00.047
with his chest all puffed up.

13:00.147 --> 13:03.316
Then he beat the best car
on the strip in a stock Mustang.

13:04.751 --> 13:06.820
He was getting out
of the Marine Corps.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.488
Was that to be with you?

13:09.289 --> 13:11.024
Nobody else in the unit
knew about you.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.626
Is there a reason you two kept
the relationship a secret?

13:13.726 --> 13:15.028
Marines couldn't know
he was racing.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.530
Any of the other racers
know about you two?

13:17.630 --> 13:19.632
Better they did.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.534
As long as Travis was with me,

13:21.634 --> 13:23.636
they knew to keep
their distance.

13:24.571 --> 13:25.906
So you're saying
he needed protection.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.441
People don't like losing.

13:28.541 --> 13:30.210
And especially to outsiders.

13:30.310 --> 13:35.148
Maybe somebody lost bad enough
to ignore that protection.

13:35.248 --> 13:37.350
People ever put money

13:37.450 --> 13:39.452
or even their cars
on the line?

13:39.552 --> 13:41.654
Some do. Yeah.

13:41.754 --> 13:44.157
How often did Cobb
roll those dice?

13:45.692 --> 13:47.260
Every time.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.868
Boom.

13:54.968 --> 13:57.370
Wow. Going hearty.

13:57.470 --> 14:00.507
Well, feel like I'm about
to earn the extra calories.

14:00.607 --> 14:04.544
So, you think
Alex's bad grade

14:04.644 --> 14:07.280
is symptomatic
of something worse?

14:07.380 --> 14:08.448
Maybe.

14:08.548 --> 14:10.017
He's got on his plate, okay?

14:10.117 --> 14:11.919
Things can snowball.
I know.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.820
I stress about all the things
he has ahead of him, too.

14:13.921 --> 14:16.689
I feel like
there's a "but" coming.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.691
I just...
This doesn't sound like

14:18.791 --> 14:20.793
a problem yet. That's all.

14:20.894 --> 14:22.795
So you're saying
I'm overreacting. No.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.664
I would never say that.

14:24.764 --> 14:26.799
He is hiding something.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.836
All right? He's just
not around as much anymore.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.238
Stashes his phone
every time he sees me.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.173
And you haven't
figured it out yet?

14:34.574 --> 14:36.343
He met a girl, Jane.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.245
He doesn't hide them from me.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.713
Naomi, Tess...

14:40.813 --> 14:42.182
even Carly.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.251
No one liked Carly,
not even Alex.

14:44.351 --> 14:46.153
Which means he must
really like this one.

14:46.253 --> 14:48.421
I mean, you remember how I was
when we first started dating.

14:48.521 --> 14:52.225
Every moment outside of work,
I was focused on you.

14:52.325 --> 14:54.694
But I still held down a job,
made a life for ourselves.

14:54.794 --> 14:56.296
Remember?

14:56.396 --> 14:58.765
I'd page you to meet me for
a little late night movie?

14:58.865 --> 15:00.000
Oh, my gosh.

15:00.100 --> 15:02.069
You're really dating us now.

15:06.173 --> 15:09.509
<i>We're talking
$60,000 to $100,000 cars</i>

15:09.609 --> 15:11.344
with tens of thousands of
dollars in modifications.

15:11.444 --> 15:16.016
Cam shafts, headers,
carbon fiber paneling.

15:16.116 --> 15:17.584
Are you hearing
what I'm saying?

15:17.684 --> 15:20.587
I am hearing a lot of words
that I understand individually

15:20.687 --> 15:22.289
but not together.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.723
Okay, what's up?

15:23.823 --> 15:25.758
Nothing.

15:25.858 --> 15:27.427
I'm just-- I'm thinking
about barbecue

15:27.527 --> 15:30.830
and full transparency,
and it's freaking me out.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.899
So, Whistler.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.267
:
Yeah.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.269
I thought everything
was smiles and sunshine

15:36.369 --> 15:37.770
since you guys
got back together.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.339
Yeah, I know.
It's been amazing.

15:39.439 --> 15:43.676
So amazing that she wants
to tell her boss about us.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.645
It's a big deal.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.147
Good.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.416
Good, because then it's not
weird that I'm freaking out.

15:49.516 --> 15:51.751
That's a big deal for her.
Why are you freaking out?

15:51.851 --> 15:53.720
'Cause she's our FBI liaison.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.922
What happens if
her boss changes his mind

15:56.023 --> 15:57.857
after he finds out about us?

15:57.957 --> 16:00.827
And then, and then
we-we no longer work together,

16:00.927 --> 16:02.429
and then we start
to grow apart and...

16:02.529 --> 16:07.300
If that even happens,
you'll roll with it.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.470
Well, it's not just me.
She's worried about it, too.
Of course she is.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.339
I mean, Whistler might
have gone full Adele

16:12.439 --> 16:15.342
in front of our entire team, but
she wasn't always that person.

16:15.442 --> 16:17.044
I'm just saying.

16:18.445 --> 16:19.646
Hey.

16:19.746 --> 16:21.714
We got any more info
about the illegal races?

16:21.814 --> 16:23.750
Uh, ask the
resident expert.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.452
Wouldn't say
I'm an expert.

16:25.552 --> 16:27.820
Oh, you do know
a lot about cars.

16:27.920 --> 16:29.489
And you were fanboying
over that maneuver

16:29.589 --> 16:30.757
Lani pulled at the track.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.325
I don't know.
I got into cars

16:32.425 --> 16:33.860
and street racing
a long time ago.

16:33.960 --> 16:35.828
Oh, I feel like there's a story.

16:35.928 --> 16:39.899
Well, it started when I watched
<i>The Fast and the Furious.</i>

16:40.700 --> 16:41.868
I was wrong.

16:41.968 --> 16:43.036
Wait, I'm sorry.

16:43.136 --> 16:44.871
The movie about cars?

16:44.971 --> 16:47.774
Uh, first off,
it's a movie about family.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.509
And are you serious, dude?

16:49.609 --> 16:51.078
You haven't watch it?

16:52.011 --> 16:54.514
Oh, right.
It's not part of the Nora Ephron

16:54.614 --> 16:56.249
cinematic universe. Oh.

16:56.349 --> 16:57.984
Okay, listen, maybe you two can
have a movie night, all right?

16:58.085 --> 16:59.286
But for now,
how about pointing me

16:59.386 --> 17:00.953
to any leads
regarding Cobb?

17:01.054 --> 17:03.056
Yeah.
Yeah.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.258
We have been trying
to build a list

17:05.358 --> 17:08.095
of who Cobb
has raced in the past.

17:08.195 --> 17:10.197
People he might have crossed

17:10.297 --> 17:12.732
and who might've had
reason to kill him.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.234
Lani couldn't
tell us everybody,

17:14.334 --> 17:17.036
so we started just tracking
the cars themselves.

17:17.137 --> 17:18.671
Cobb's had several cars
registered under his name

17:18.771 --> 17:19.972
over the years.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.375
Yeah, all cars
you could see on a track.

17:22.475 --> 17:24.677
But he never seemed
to hang onto them for very long.

17:24.777 --> 17:26.813
Not if he was rolling the dice
every time he went out there.

17:26.913 --> 17:30.049
The latest is a Toyota Supra
that he registered last week.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.051
No records of him
purchasing it, either.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.253
Then who did?

17:33.353 --> 17:34.787
The car was so new
it didn't even have

17:34.887 --> 17:36.323
a title in the system yet.

17:36.423 --> 17:38.458
So we're in the process
of tracking the purchase.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.860
That's got to sting,
losing a car you just bought.

17:40.960 --> 17:42.395
Yeah, especially
to somebody

17:42.495 --> 17:43.996
you already think
doesn't belong.

17:44.097 --> 17:45.432
Well, where's the car now?

17:45.532 --> 17:48.235
We can't find it.

17:48.335 --> 17:50.937
It's not at Cobb's house
or at K-Bay.

17:51.037 --> 17:52.339
So put out a BOLO.

17:52.439 --> 17:55.342
Find the car,
maybe we find the murderer.

18:00.947 --> 18:03.850
Ernie, any luck
finding the Supra?

18:03.950 --> 18:06.153
I sent HPD
everything I had.

18:06.253 --> 18:09.021
They pulled over a vehicle
matching the description.

18:10.190 --> 18:12.024
Then why aren't you
more like...

18:12.125 --> 18:14.661
"Yeah, bro, I just
solved the case"?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.863
Mostly because I would
never say that.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.132
But also this.

18:21.468 --> 18:24.771
Footage of HPD pulling
over the Supra.

18:27.073 --> 18:29.442
We're looking for a racer
and murderer, and, uh,

18:29.542 --> 18:32.545
that guy looks like he says,
"It's mai tai o'clock."

18:32.645 --> 18:34.147
He said he purchased
the vehicle yesterday

18:34.247 --> 18:35.648
through an online ad.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.651
According to the VIN and
title, it's not Cobb's car.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.887
Yeah, but it's the same make,
same model,

18:40.987 --> 18:42.389
and it matches the description.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.023
And what, we're just
supposed to believe

18:44.123 --> 18:45.892
that it's not Cobb's car?

18:47.260 --> 18:48.928
That is why
you're not done. Okay.

18:49.028 --> 18:51.764
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.167
It's called VIN cloning.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.303
You take the VIN number
from a clean car,

18:56.403 --> 18:58.805
put it on a stolen car
to mask the theft.

18:58.905 --> 19:00.907
Cobb's car was stolen...

19:01.007 --> 19:03.510
and ended up in a chop shop.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.378
Can you, can you
figure out which one?

19:05.478 --> 19:08.581
Using details from
the images of the ad,

19:08.681 --> 19:11.684
signage, proximity to landmarks,

19:11.784 --> 19:13.119
I may be able to I.D.

19:13.220 --> 19:16.456
the location of
potential chop shops nearby.

19:16.556 --> 19:18.458
That's Kaka'ako.

19:18.558 --> 19:21.294
Right around the street
from an auto repair shop.

19:21.394 --> 19:23.796
Oh, it's a great place
to operate a chop shop.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.598
You did solve the case.

19:31.671 --> 19:33.540
NCIS!
Hands up!

19:33.640 --> 19:35.242
Whoa, whoa!
Let's go, let's go!

19:35.342 --> 19:37.043
Back against the car!
Hands where I can see them!

19:37.143 --> 19:39.479
Federal agency. Keep your hands
where I can see them.

19:39.579 --> 19:40.980
Hey, NCIS! Hands up!

19:41.080 --> 19:42.749
On your knees!

19:53.159 --> 19:55.362
Clear.
Clear.

20:00.132 --> 20:02.168
VIN number is being scratched.

20:05.572 --> 20:06.806
Blank titles.

20:07.940 --> 20:11.110
Hey, guys, you might want
to come in here.

20:12.979 --> 20:14.481
What you got, Luce?

20:14.581 --> 20:17.216
That's a bullet hole.

20:26.993 --> 20:28.261
Thank you.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.130
Hey, Kai, get the lights. Yeah.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.072
Oh, yeah.

20:40.172 --> 20:41.874
That is a bullet hole.

20:41.974 --> 20:44.544
And a whole lot of blood
to go with it.

20:52.852 --> 20:54.321
MCRT found
a nine-millimeter slug,

20:54.421 --> 20:56.656
and we're collecting DNA
and pulling chemical samples

20:56.756 --> 20:58.791
to see if we can
match those found

20:58.891 --> 21:00.860
in Staff Sergeant Cobb's
airways.

21:00.960 --> 21:03.563
But all signs point to him
being murdered in a paint booth.

21:03.663 --> 21:04.864
What else have you found?

21:04.964 --> 21:06.399
It's a crime haven here.

21:06.499 --> 21:08.601
We're talking stolen vehicles,
drug paraphernalia,

21:08.701 --> 21:10.236
fraudulent documentation,

21:10.337 --> 21:11.971
but also racing gear.

21:12.071 --> 21:13.940
So someone here
is tied to that world.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.376
And killed Cobb. Anyone talking?

21:16.476 --> 21:18.978
We're trying to squeeze them,
but they're staying quiet.

21:19.078 --> 21:20.680
All right, well, do we know
who runs this place?

21:20.780 --> 21:21.781
The business is registered

21:21.881 --> 21:23.350
under an LLC, not a person.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.917
And if they're good,

21:25.017 --> 21:26.953
it'll take us a beat to unpack
who the real owner is.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.556
We're pulling prints
in the meantime, but honestly,

21:29.656 --> 21:30.890
no telling how many come back.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.625
All right, well,
see if any of those prints

21:32.725 --> 21:34.260
point to investigations
in other agencies.

21:34.361 --> 21:36.663
Maybe someone already did
the legwork for us.

21:40.467 --> 21:42.234
Thank you.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.137
FBI coming in with the assist.

21:45.237 --> 21:48.508
Everything we have on the people
working in that chop shop.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.042
Thank you.

21:50.142 --> 21:52.144
Take it this means
nothing changed.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.948
Oh, Lucy was worried
that you weren't gonna be

21:56.048 --> 21:57.984
the NCIS liaison anymore.

21:58.084 --> 22:00.520
Oh, that.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.255
Sorry.
She talks to me about stuff.

22:03.356 --> 22:05.458
Trust me, I know.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.827
So, how'd it go?

22:09.496 --> 22:12.064
You're asking me to talk about
things outside of work?

22:12.164 --> 22:15.334
Happy to talk about
criminals, too.

22:17.604 --> 22:19.372
Uh, yeah, it was fine.

22:20.373 --> 22:21.808
But...?

22:22.809 --> 22:25.177
Well, it was awkward.

22:25.277 --> 22:28.280
I mean, first, I-I-I walk in,
and he's playing with

22:28.381 --> 22:29.682
some fancy new tongs.

22:29.782 --> 22:31.418
Weird.

22:31.518 --> 22:32.819
He's really into barbecue.

22:32.919 --> 22:34.120
Then I had this whole speech
prepared about

22:34.220 --> 22:35.855
how I'm dating
an NCIS special agent

22:35.955 --> 22:37.790
and how I won't let it interfere
with my responsibilities,

22:37.890 --> 22:39.426
and he stops me.

22:39.526 --> 22:42.729
Apparently, it's... it's just
a form I have to fill out.

22:42.829 --> 22:44.664
Sounds easy enough.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.198
But then he said,

22:46.298 --> 22:49.402
"Can't wait to meet him
at the barbecue."

22:50.403 --> 22:52.171
Oh.
And I said,

22:52.271 --> 22:54.607
"Same. Thanks."

22:54.707 --> 22:57.143
"Thanks"?
Now he's gonna

22:57.243 --> 23:00.379
expect me to show up with,
like, someone like Kai.

23:00.480 --> 23:03.816
Well, that's on him, not you.

23:03.916 --> 23:05.585
What do I tell Lucy?

23:05.685 --> 23:07.253
She'll be fine.

23:07.353 --> 23:08.888
I don't know
if you know this or not,

23:08.988 --> 23:11.424
but she's pretty crazy
about you.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.770
Hey, it's almost
time to eat.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.272
I'll eat later.
I have a lot of work to do.

23:28.374 --> 23:30.710
Alex.
Yeah?

23:30.810 --> 23:32.211
Come here a sec.

23:36.282 --> 23:37.383
What's up?

23:38.417 --> 23:39.819
Are you dating someone?

23:42.021 --> 23:44.957
Like, it's fine
if you are.
I know it's fine.

23:45.057 --> 23:47.727
How long?
Two months.

23:48.895 --> 23:50.497
Why does it matter?
Don't you trust me?

23:50.597 --> 23:51.698
Of course I do.

23:51.798 --> 23:54.166
So we're fine, then. Totally.

23:54.266 --> 23:58.170
Except you
usually tell me.

23:58.270 --> 24:01.273
Which suggests there's
a reason you aren't now.

24:01.373 --> 24:04.577
Or it suggests you need me
to tell you everything

24:04.677 --> 24:05.978
in order to trust me.

24:06.078 --> 24:07.680
Look, if I see my son
acting differently,

24:07.780 --> 24:09.982
I have a right to know
what's happening in his life.

24:10.082 --> 24:11.784
This is all because
of that English assignment.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.620
No, it's because
you're keeping secrets.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.121
It was one bad grade.

24:15.221 --> 24:16.756
Look, I can't be
there for you

24:16.856 --> 24:18.324
if I don't know
where "there" is.

24:18.424 --> 24:20.426
I don't need you
to be there for me.

24:24.864 --> 24:27.166
I'm sorry. I...
Maybe you don't.

24:27.967 --> 24:31.137
But I'm still the parent,
and you're still the kid.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.675
I'll save some food for you.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.254
<i>Whistler came through.</i>

24:48.354 --> 24:51.457
FBI sent over profiles,
dossiers, rap sheets.

24:51.558 --> 24:52.825
It's a good thing, too,

24:52.925 --> 24:54.961
'cause we tracked
the purchase of the Supra.

24:55.061 --> 24:56.563
Guy who lost it's been
off-island.

24:56.663 --> 24:57.930
Couldn't have killed Cobb.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.632
All right, who else do we have?

24:59.732 --> 25:03.002
I narrowed it down to
six potential suspects.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.738
We are looking at
things like motive,

25:05.838 --> 25:07.473
opportunity, history.

25:07.574 --> 25:10.910
Yeah, David Kang spent time in
Halawa for aggravated assault,

25:11.010 --> 25:13.312
Andrew Ray for armed robbery
and grand theft.

25:13.412 --> 25:14.647
Tell me about him.

25:14.747 --> 25:17.116
Solomon "Sol" de la Cruz.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.851
Did three years for
second-degree assault.

25:18.951 --> 25:21.754
Which he pleaded down from
attempted second-degree murder.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.189
Yeah, as well as

25:23.289 --> 25:26.392
auto theft and violating
Hawai'i statute 286-43:

25:26.492 --> 25:28.895
altering the identification
mark of a vehicle.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.697
FBI's building
a drug case against him,

25:30.797 --> 25:34.567
but the man has all the
experience to work a chop shop.

25:34.667 --> 25:35.902
Maybe even run it.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.269
Does he have
a connection to Cobb?

25:37.369 --> 25:40.206
Other than they both
like cars, no.

25:40.306 --> 25:42.408
Do any of the other guys?

25:42.508 --> 25:44.210
They all have the capacity
to pull the trigger,

25:44.310 --> 25:46.112
but finding the motive's
been the tricky part.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.414
Ooh, found it.

25:48.514 --> 25:50.617
Sol's connection to Cobb.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.223
That's Lani Jones.

25:58.024 --> 25:59.992
Cobb's girlfriend.

26:01.628 --> 26:03.162
We dated years ago.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.632
We were practically kids.

26:05.732 --> 26:09.168
Well, old enough for him
to get a tattoo of you.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.638
He surprised me with it.

26:11.738 --> 26:13.205
Heck of a surprise.

26:13.305 --> 26:16.375
Um, you do stupid things
when you're young and in love.

26:17.476 --> 26:19.345
You do.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.582
So, what changed?

26:23.683 --> 26:25.284
He did.

26:25.384 --> 26:28.020
Started getting
into shady stuff.

26:28.988 --> 26:30.556
I couldn't be a part of it.

26:30.657 --> 26:33.926
And how'd he feel when
you started dating other guys?

26:34.026 --> 26:36.495
You think he killed Travis?

26:36.595 --> 26:39.832
I'm just asking
if there's reason to believe

26:39.932 --> 26:42.034
that Sol would.

26:44.436 --> 26:45.705
Yes.

26:45.805 --> 26:48.641
But I told him to stay away.

26:48.741 --> 26:51.277
Apparently, he didn't listen.

26:52.311 --> 26:55.281
So, do you have any idea
where Sol might be?

27:00.186 --> 27:01.888
What time is it?

27:17.704 --> 27:19.706
There he is.

27:22.474 --> 27:23.943
There's a lot
of bystanders.

27:24.043 --> 27:27.013
Let's try to do this
quietly, then. Okay.

27:27.113 --> 27:29.749
Maybe he'll give up easy.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.818
Don't jinx it.

27:31.918 --> 27:33.385
Federal agents.

27:33.485 --> 27:35.955
Hands where I can see them.
We need you to come with us.

27:42.929 --> 27:44.663
You had to jinx it!

27:46.899 --> 27:48.467
Ah!

28:00.146 --> 28:01.613
You picked the wrong car, brah.

28:01.714 --> 28:03.315
Hey, Sol.

28:11.257 --> 28:13.259
Didn't want to tackle him?

28:14.393 --> 28:16.362
And risk hitting
one of these cars?

28:17.363 --> 28:18.564
No.

28:25.838 --> 28:29.641
It's pretty bold to be
hanging out at an auto show

28:29.742 --> 28:31.944
after we just raided
your chop shop.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.213
I like cars.
And it's not my chop shop.

28:34.313 --> 28:35.982
Yeah? Well, you're there a lot

28:36.082 --> 28:39.085
and, uh, you know,
your prints are all over it.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.787
I like cars.

28:40.887 --> 28:42.521
Were you there three nights ago?

28:42.621 --> 28:43.856
I know this game.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.491
I didn't do
whatever you think I did.

28:45.591 --> 28:47.659
Look, with your history

28:47.760 --> 28:49.161
and the heat that
you're facing now,

28:49.261 --> 28:51.530
I would say cooperating
is your best option.

28:51.630 --> 28:52.865
I work at an auto repair shop.

28:52.965 --> 28:54.200
That's all you know.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.035
Everything else
has reasonable doubt.

28:56.135 --> 28:58.304
You know who
doesn't use terms

28:58.404 --> 29:00.206
like "reasonable doubt"?

29:00.306 --> 29:01.707
Innocent people.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.876
Got to know about crime
when you're a criminal.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.945
So, you admit to being
a criminal?

29:06.045 --> 29:08.848
Got that stamped on me
a long time ago.

29:08.948 --> 29:10.549
Kind of like that?

29:10.649 --> 29:12.618
Yeah.

29:12.718 --> 29:14.453
We talked to your
ex-girlfriend.

29:14.553 --> 29:16.488
Hell of a driver.

29:16.588 --> 29:18.157
Oh, yeah.

29:18.257 --> 29:20.692
We also heard
you're the jealous type.

29:20.793 --> 29:21.994
Was it hard

29:22.094 --> 29:23.695
seeing her with other guys?

29:23.796 --> 29:26.165
And especially after
this last one, right?

29:26.265 --> 29:30.569
Just a clean-cut
marine in his day job

29:30.669 --> 29:32.138
and a hell of a racer
in his off-hours.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.773
And even though he was
an outsider, he just seemed...

29:34.874 --> 29:38.444
just seemed perfect for her.

29:38.544 --> 29:40.079
Unlike you.

29:40.179 --> 29:42.815
You think I killed this guy
'cause he hurt my feelings?

29:44.150 --> 29:46.919
Our medical examiner
found trace evidence

29:47.019 --> 29:49.721
of a unique chemical in
Travis Cobb's airways.

29:49.822 --> 29:52.024
At first, she wasn't
sure what it was,

29:52.124 --> 29:55.194
but after a visit to
where he was murdered,

29:55.294 --> 29:57.296
it all made sense.

29:57.396 --> 29:58.898
Isocyanate.

29:58.998 --> 29:59.999
Found in high-performance
car paint,

30:00.099 --> 30:01.467
in Travis Cobb's lungs,

30:01.567 --> 30:03.735
and in the paint booth
where you murdered him.

30:05.604 --> 30:07.673
Hey.
Get a medic.

30:07.773 --> 30:09.308
Medic!

30:09.408 --> 30:10.709
Hey.

30:10.809 --> 30:12.178
Get a medic!

30:12.278 --> 30:14.513
<i>Hypersensitivity pneumonitis.</i>

30:14.613 --> 30:17.516
Sol is deathly allergic
to car paint.

30:17.616 --> 30:21.020
Okay, well, that makes shooting
Cobb in a paint booth difficult.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.621
Well, impossible, actually.

30:22.721 --> 30:24.056
MCRT did another sweep.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.692
Sol's prints are literally
everywhere but the booth.

30:27.559 --> 30:29.962
All right, maybe we're thinking
about this all wrong.

30:30.062 --> 30:31.898
Maybe Cobb wasn't there
even about his car

30:31.998 --> 30:33.732
or to confront somebody.

30:33.832 --> 30:35.501
You think he was
meeting someone?

30:35.601 --> 30:37.403
Or someone brought him in.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.372
What's a guy like Cobb
doing at a chop shop, though?

30:40.472 --> 30:42.108
I don't know-- he was getting
out of the Marine Corps

30:42.208 --> 30:43.910
to settle into
the racing world, you know?

30:44.010 --> 30:46.445
He had skills from working
in a motor pool.

30:46.545 --> 30:48.314
I mean, he'd be useful
at a place like that.

30:48.414 --> 30:50.582
Someone was trying
to read him in.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.251
Guys, I broke through!

30:52.351 --> 30:54.853
The LLC that owns the repair
shop is owned by another LLC,

30:54.954 --> 30:57.924
which is owned by another LLC.

30:58.024 --> 30:59.158
Well, uh, you get the point?

30:59.258 --> 31:00.859
For a bunch of gearheads,
they're good.

31:00.960 --> 31:03.395
But even Michael Schumacher
made mistakes.

31:03.495 --> 31:04.730
Like when he was disqualified

31:04.830 --> 31:06.065
for turning in
on Villeneuve on lap 48

31:06.165 --> 31:08.434
of the 1997 Final Grand Prix. Ernie.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.737
Sorry. Research led me down
very specific rabbit holes.

31:11.837 --> 31:13.872
And irrelevant
though they may seem,

31:13.973 --> 31:16.375
it made me realize...

31:16.475 --> 31:18.077
look for the mistakes.

31:20.012 --> 31:22.548
A few years ago,
someone failed to file

31:22.648 --> 31:23.916
proper documentation.

31:24.016 --> 31:25.517
And when the IRS
audit showed up,

31:25.617 --> 31:28.354
so did the owner,
Myron Chan.

31:28.454 --> 31:30.589
Not a lot on him as of late.

31:30.689 --> 31:32.424
Sort of been M.I.A.

31:33.292 --> 31:35.061
Okay, well, did he have
any connections to Cobb?

31:35.161 --> 31:37.063
I'm still looking,
but I can link him to both

31:37.163 --> 31:39.932
the auto shop and the junkyard
where Cobb was dumped.

31:40.032 --> 31:42.701
So, when you say M.I.A...

31:42.801 --> 31:45.237
Please.
I'll text you his address.

31:53.279 --> 31:55.881
There's no way
this guy killed Cobb.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.684
He may know who did it.
He owns the place.

31:58.784 --> 32:00.919
Mr. Chan.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.355
I'm Special Agent Lucy Tara

32:03.455 --> 32:04.523
from NCIS.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.258
I have some questions for you.

32:08.260 --> 32:11.063
You're the registered owner
of Surfrider Auto Repair.

32:11.163 --> 32:13.532
We know it's a front
for a chop shop.

32:15.167 --> 32:17.836
A marine was killed
in your facility.

32:19.438 --> 32:24.510
Mr. Chan, if you're here,
who's running the operation?

32:26.478 --> 32:28.047
Hey.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.916
Someone's been visiting.

32:49.068 --> 32:51.137
Lani Jones.

32:55.774 --> 32:57.709
<i>What else do we have
on Lani Jones?</i>

32:57.809 --> 32:59.878
All right,
though her family

32:59.978 --> 33:01.947
is racing royalty,
it turns out they got

33:02.048 --> 33:04.183
into serious financial trouble
about a decade ago.

33:04.283 --> 33:06.552
They had taken out massive loans
to build a racetrack.

33:06.652 --> 33:09.488
Except that's when all racing
on the island became illegal.

33:09.588 --> 33:11.623
So they turned
to a life of crime.

33:11.723 --> 33:13.025
Cue "Uncle" Myron.

33:13.125 --> 33:15.527
He had the infrastructure
and a cancer diagnosis.

33:15.627 --> 33:18.730
It makes sense he let
the chop shop operate there

33:18.830 --> 33:20.332
in exchange for
early retirement.

33:20.432 --> 33:21.967
Lani's dad was running it
before he passed,

33:22.068 --> 33:22.968
and now she's in charge.

33:23.069 --> 33:24.403
And it turns out

33:24.503 --> 33:27.506
our devastated girlfriend
is quite ruthless.

33:27.606 --> 33:29.341
I dug into her past.

33:29.441 --> 33:31.310
She has a history
of violent behavior.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.513
Cobb was ready to give up
everything for her,

33:34.613 --> 33:36.782
and she killed him? Why?

33:36.882 --> 33:38.417
Maybe he changed his mind?

33:38.517 --> 33:40.819
There's only one person
who knows the answer.

33:46.225 --> 33:47.659
Jesse, take the front.

33:47.759 --> 33:51.397
Kai, take the opposite side.
Lucy, you're with me.

33:57.336 --> 33:59.071
Lani's been
cooperating so far.

33:59.171 --> 34:00.506
You think
she's gonna resist?

34:00.606 --> 34:03.209
The second she realizes
she's a suspect.

34:07.579 --> 34:09.481
Lani's fleeing!

34:09.581 --> 34:11.317
Jump!

34:26.732 --> 34:28.167
This is Special Agent
in Charge Tennant

34:28.267 --> 34:30.035
requesting air support
for suspect fleeing

34:30.136 --> 34:32.003
eastbound toward Farrington
Highway in a red Nissan 350Z.

34:32.104 --> 34:34.173
I got to sign you guys up
for my dodgeball team.

34:34.273 --> 34:35.607
Y'all go after her.

34:35.707 --> 34:36.908
I'll stay back
and clear the house with Kai.

34:37.008 --> 34:38.610
Where's Kai?

34:56.228 --> 34:58.597
<i>Ernie,</i>

34:58.697 --> 35:00.166
tell me you have eyes on Lani.

35:00.266 --> 35:01.433
Working on it.

35:01.533 --> 35:03.769
HPD helo is arriving
on station...

35:03.869 --> 35:05.137
now.

35:05.237 --> 35:06.538
Is Kai okay?

35:06.638 --> 35:08.607
He's better than okay.
He's gaining on her.

35:14.045 --> 35:15.547
Ernie, how far back are we?

35:15.647 --> 35:16.782
You wouldn't happen to have

35:16.882 --> 35:18.250
nitrous on that thing,
would you?

35:24.723 --> 35:26.124
All right, how much road
do we have left?

35:26.225 --> 35:28.594
HPD's setting a roadblock
about a half a mile ahead.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.196
All right. Go, go, go, go.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.159
That curve's our chance.

36:01.260 --> 36:02.994
You trust me?

36:07.633 --> 36:09.368
What are you doing?

36:09.468 --> 36:11.903
Loosening my grip.

36:28.920 --> 36:30.322
It's the end of the road.

36:31.122 --> 36:32.624
<i>Lani's in the process</i>

36:32.724 --> 36:35.126
of making a full confession
to Cobb's murder.

36:35.227 --> 36:37.729
And turning state's evidence
about the chop shop's dealings.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.498
It's probably the only hope
she ever has

36:39.598 --> 36:41.267
of seeing the outside
of a prison again.

36:41.367 --> 36:43.702
Should help the FBI
close up a few cases, too.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.804
Aren't you glad
you trusted me not to crash?

36:45.904 --> 36:48.139
It was like I was
watching <i>Bullitt.</i>

36:48.240 --> 36:49.308
No, <i>Fury Road.</i>

36:49.408 --> 36:51.243
Or <i>Fast and the Furious?</i>

36:51.343 --> 36:53.011
Kai cutting through traffic
like butter.

36:53.111 --> 36:54.746
And that PIT maneuver.
Oh! It was a thing of beauty.

36:54.846 --> 36:56.147
Okay, it was, but it was

36:56.248 --> 36:57.816
way more intense
in the passenger seat.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.117
Well, that's just because
you weren't in control.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.153
Me, on the other hand,
total control.

37:02.254 --> 37:04.856
Aw, all this because she almost
ran over your friends.

37:04.956 --> 37:06.792
I don't have friends.

37:08.260 --> 37:09.561
I got 'ohana.

37:09.661 --> 37:11.697
Bro!

37:11.797 --> 37:13.332
I watched it last night.
It's good.

37:13.432 --> 37:14.766
No way.
Aw.

37:14.866 --> 37:16.568
Tell me a time and a place,

37:16.668 --> 37:18.704
and I'll watch the rest
of them with you. Um...

37:18.804 --> 37:20.339
How many are there?

37:21.607 --> 37:23.342
There's many.
Mm-hmm.

37:23.442 --> 37:24.476
So, so many.

37:24.576 --> 37:25.611
Yeah?
And they're awesome.

37:25.711 --> 37:27.178
It's a lot of them.

37:27.279 --> 37:29.715
It's like a trilogy, right?
Way better.

37:30.816 --> 37:32.284
So, just a form, huh?

37:32.384 --> 37:33.885
Yeah, looks like I'll still be

37:33.985 --> 37:36.054
dropping in as
NCIS's FBI liaison.

37:36.154 --> 37:37.989
I can't believe
we were so worried about it.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.592
I went to some
pretty dark places.

37:40.692 --> 37:43.028
Uh, there is something
else, though.

37:43.128 --> 37:46.698
My-my boss kind of
assumes you're a guy.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.267
Oh.

37:50.302 --> 37:52.671
I mean, Lucy's not really
a masculine name.

37:52.771 --> 37:54.139
No, it-it's my fault.

37:54.239 --> 37:55.507
I mean, he said, "Looking
forward to meeting him,"

37:55.607 --> 37:56.575
and I should've
just said "her."

37:56.675 --> 37:57.776
Hey, hey. It's fine.
It's fine.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.711
No, it's not,
it's not fine, Lucy.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.615
I...

38:03.715 --> 38:05.884
I haven't done this before.

38:09.555 --> 38:13.892
Have you ever introduced
a girlfriend to your coworkers?

38:15.160 --> 38:17.363
You make it look so easy.

38:17.463 --> 38:19.865
You know, we don't have
to do this today.
No, no.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.800
I-I want to. I just...

38:24.370 --> 38:26.104
It's a lot for me.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.074
Well, you won't be alone.

38:29.174 --> 38:31.810
I'll be right here with ya.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.113
Always.

38:35.947 --> 38:37.649

38:37.749 --> 38:39.284

terrible on the phone.

39:54.225 --> 39:55.527
That's right.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.362
You were more of
a pager guy.

39:58.664 --> 40:00.932
Want a drink?
Yes.

40:01.032 --> 40:05.103
So, Alex has
a girlfriend.

40:05.203 --> 40:06.538
Yes.

40:06.638 --> 40:09.575
Not sure it was worth
the trouble of finding out.

40:09.675 --> 40:12.478
Well, at least it's all
out in the open now.

40:16.381 --> 40:17.849
I just...

40:19.150 --> 40:21.119
I needed to know
what was going on with him.

40:24.089 --> 40:26.157
When, uh, Alex was
five years old,

40:26.257 --> 40:28.527
he came into the living room--
You were running late from work.

40:28.627 --> 40:30.862
Uh, something was
going on with him,

40:30.962 --> 40:34.365
and he asked me, um...

40:34.466 --> 40:36.301
"How much longer
until Mommy gets home?"

40:36.401 --> 40:40.038
And I said, "Uh, an hour or so.
But maybe I can help you out."

40:40.138 --> 40:42.273
And you know what he told me?

40:43.074 --> 40:44.476
"It's okay.

40:44.576 --> 40:47.345
I'll wait till Mommy gets home.
She'll fix it."

40:48.680 --> 40:51.983
Then you got home,
and you fixed it.

40:53.752 --> 40:55.521
He was sad that day

40:55.621 --> 40:59.658
because the kids didn't like
his show-and-tell about beetles.

41:04.796 --> 41:06.031
And he grew up.

41:06.131 --> 41:08.800
Was kind of hoping
you could fix that, too.

41:10.636 --> 41:13.238
You know, I think about
all the decisions

41:13.338 --> 41:15.741
he's gonna have to make
this year.

41:15.841 --> 41:17.175
What's gonna happen...

41:17.275 --> 41:18.910
It's not just
his life, Janey.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.478
It's ours, too.

41:20.579 --> 41:23.248
Every day,
I struggle

41:23.348 --> 41:25.584
to stop myself from trying
to keep him on the track

41:25.684 --> 41:27.252
I think is right for him.

41:27.352 --> 41:29.755
Maybe we just need
to loosen our grip a bit.

41:32.591 --> 41:35.326
Trust Alex not to crash.

41:35.426 --> 41:36.995
Fair enough.
