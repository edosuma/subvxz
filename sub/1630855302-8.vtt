WEBVTT

00:14.515 --> 00:16.517
Um, so, where's
the big surprise?

00:16.517 --> 00:18.853
Patience,
my little chicky nuggets.

00:18.853 --> 00:20.563
Captain Barnes here
is gonna explain

00:20.563 --> 00:22.857
why you've all been invited
on our mystery cruise.

00:23.607 --> 00:24.775
Floor's yours, captain!

00:25.693 --> 00:26.527
Thank you.

00:27.111 --> 00:28.446
Good news, everybody.

00:28.446 --> 00:29.655
I am the new...

00:29.655 --> 00:31.449
Oh, my God,
the engine's been cut!

00:31.449 --> 00:32.950
Justin,
you just shut it off.

00:32.950 --> 00:35.536
You're really
killin' my drama here.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.830
You gotta pause for effect,
then reel 'em in.

00:37.830 --> 00:40.458
You know, what kills the drama is
you giving me notes in the middle of it!

00:40.458 --> 00:42.209
I know, but this is just
a really big moment for you, and

00:42.209 --> 00:44.795
- I really want you to land it.
- What are we landing, exactly?

00:44.795 --> 00:46.046
Billie found a new home
for the Boathouse.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.590
- Oh, my God, Justin!
- Oh!

00:47.590 --> 00:49.425
Have you been talking
to Clementine Farnsworth?

00:49.425 --> 00:50.843
Is she getting
secret listings?

00:50.843 --> 00:52.636
The tree planters have
been leasing some shoreline

00:52.636 --> 00:54.472
for their base camp,
and the owners wanna sell.

00:54.472 --> 00:56.223
If we get in first,
we could break ground

00:56.223 --> 00:57.975
on a new Boathouse
by Labour Day.

00:57.975 --> 00:59.935
Turn your heads around,
my little sweet potatoes,

00:59.935 --> 01:01.812
and feast your eyes!

01:03.230 --> 01:04.732
We buildin' on water, bub?

01:04.732 --> 01:07.860
Oh, his father's eyes
went at the same age.

01:07.860 --> 01:11.280
- But Derrick had
a jawline for glasses.
- My jawline is fine.

01:11.280 --> 01:14.700
If we have to wait for rescue,
I vote we eat Justin first.

01:14.700 --> 01:18.245
No, no one is going anywhere
or cannibalizing anybody.

01:18.788 --> 01:21.040
After being treated
all summer

01:21.040 --> 01:22.625
like the world's
cuddliest war criminal,

01:22.625 --> 01:24.376
I am gonna have justice!

01:24.376 --> 01:26.128
So we made sure
that no one can escape,

01:26.128 --> 01:27.505
- because I...
- We. We.

01:27.505 --> 01:28.839
We...
Sorry, sorry.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.883
...solved the mystery
of the Boathouse fire.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.551
Oh, yeah.

01:33.135 --> 01:35.638
And there is
an arsonist among us.

01:38.140 --> 01:39.600
And they're
on this very boat.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.700
Why'd we stop?

01:56.700 --> 01:58.994
Did the unicorn
run out of gas?

01:58.994 --> 02:01.080
Justin turned off the engine.

02:01.080 --> 02:02.331
How do you know?

02:02.331 --> 02:04.083
Claire's live podcasting
from the boat.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.752
- That makes me sad.
- Justin and Billie think

02:06.752 --> 02:08.629
someone on board
torched the Boathouse.

02:08.629 --> 02:11.006
They're doing, like,
a whole <i>Downton Shabby</i> reveal.

02:11.006 --> 02:12.216
Does it have subtitles?

02:12.216 --> 02:15.094
Whoever burned down
the Boathouse was a guest

02:15.094 --> 02:17.555
at the "Wedding that Wasn't."

02:17.555 --> 02:18.889
Good title.

02:18.889 --> 02:21.100
- Yes, thank you.
- What about Riley?

02:21.100 --> 02:23.561
- He was there too.
- Yeah, so, Riley's been asked

02:23.561 --> 02:25.563
- to exhibit in Brussels.
- Ontario?

02:25.563 --> 02:27.147
The European-Canadian
art corridor

02:27.147 --> 02:29.108
is a smaller circuit,
but it's no less prestigious.

02:29.108 --> 02:31.402
Oh, did he turn you down?

02:31.402 --> 02:34.446
Riley was actually in Paris
when Jayne's tires blew.

02:34.446 --> 02:36.991
But the rest of you
each had the means,

02:36.991 --> 02:39.702
motive, and opportunity
to bring down the Boathouse.

02:39.702 --> 02:43.414
No more so than the most
hated person on the lake:

02:43.414 --> 02:44.748
Maisy-May.

02:44.748 --> 02:46.834
I think you poll higher.

02:48.878 --> 02:50.546
Maisy's always
wanted what's mine!

02:50.546 --> 02:52.089
My cottage, my father.

02:52.089 --> 02:54.133
My uncanny ability
to relate to teen girls.

02:54.133 --> 02:55.634
From '90s comedies.

02:55.634 --> 02:56.886
And the jealousy.

02:56.886 --> 02:58.762
Oh!

02:58.762 --> 03:02.308
The jealousy ate Maisy up!

03:02.308 --> 03:05.060
Or, furious that her mom
had taken her cottage,

03:05.060 --> 03:06.353
Maisy decided
to get it back.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.563
By burning Mimsy alive.

03:08.105 --> 03:10.482
Yes, but we all know
the depraved lengths

03:10.482 --> 03:13.944
Maisy will go to when it comes
to keeping her stolen cottage.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.071
<i>Rigging an election.</i>

03:16.071 --> 03:17.740
<i>Ruining Prank Day.</i>

03:17.740 --> 03:20.534
<i>Oh, God, what the hell, Maisy?</i>

03:20.534 --> 03:22.036
<i>Drowning me.</i>

03:22.036 --> 03:23.913
<i>The cottage is mine!</i>

03:23.913 --> 03:25.623
<i>And physical assault.</i>

03:25.623 --> 03:27.082
- <i>Once!</i>
- <i>Ugh!</i>

03:28.083 --> 03:30.210
No one wants my mom gone
more than I do,

03:30.210 --> 03:32.296
but why kill
an already dying woman?

03:32.296 --> 03:33.631
Unless she asked.

03:33.631 --> 03:34.840
My mother
couldn't have done it.

03:35.382 --> 03:36.884
You're describing
a crime of passion,

03:36.884 --> 03:38.761
and my mom is
100% premeditated.

03:38.761 --> 03:40.346
Yes, that's true!

03:40.346 --> 03:42.014
Crimes of passion are
typically committed by

03:42.014 --> 03:44.350
people who can experience
actual human emotion.

03:44.350 --> 03:47.061
And the human who burned down
the Boathouse hated it so much,

03:47.061 --> 03:48.979
they sabotaged
every effort to bring it back.

03:48.979 --> 03:51.565
Like nailing my tires
and stealing my spares

03:51.565 --> 03:53.609
so I'd never become
the Cabin Flip Bitch!

03:54.193 --> 03:56.654
Or prank a ghost
to tank the sale, right?

03:56.654 --> 03:58.155
But Maisy
couldn't have done it,

03:58.155 --> 03:59.657
because she was with me
when Phoebe...

03:59.657 --> 04:00.824
Fo-ee-bee.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.619
...Fo-ee-bee got
the prank call.

04:03.619 --> 04:07.456
Which brings us to
the widdle demon child

04:07.456 --> 04:09.249
from her burning bush.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.918
Bring it, old man.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.962
Mocked for his
New Wave movie nights

04:12.962 --> 04:14.672
and banished from
the Talent Show committee,

04:14.672 --> 04:17.383
Opal hated the Boathouse's
antiquated traditions.

04:17.383 --> 04:19.218
<i>That's why
there's a sign-up sheet.</i>

04:19.218 --> 04:20.970
<i>He's still a bit upset
over getting booted off</i>

04:20.970 --> 04:22.137
<i>the Talent Show committee.</i>

04:22.137 --> 04:23.931
<i>The lake just isn't
ready for</i> Moulin Rouge!

04:23.931 --> 04:26.141
<i>So he became
our wedding planner</i>

04:26.141 --> 04:27.685
<i>so that his origami-themed decor</i>

04:27.685 --> 04:29.895
<i>would turn the Boathouse
into a tinderbox!</i>

04:29.895 --> 04:31.355
We talked about this, Justin.

04:31.355 --> 04:33.190
Opal couldn't have
stolen Jayne's spare

04:33.190 --> 04:34.984
because Jayne was driving
Tegan and Sara,

04:34.984 --> 04:36.527
and he didn't know that
until after she'd gone!

04:36.527 --> 04:38.028
I know, but if we're
doing <i>Death on the Nile,</i>

04:38.028 --> 04:39.780
then I have to go through
all the suspects!

04:39.780 --> 04:41.365
- Okay, okay, fine.
- Did you guys watch

04:41.365 --> 04:43.409
the reboot
or the 1978 classic?

04:43.409 --> 04:45.327
- How dare you!
- Do me, do me!

04:46.370 --> 04:49.498
Oh. Oh, you're...
you're not on the list.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.500
Yeah, you know, everyone
kind of loves you, Victor.

04:51.500 --> 04:55.212
Mm-hmm. Yes, you have
wakeboard abs and zero motive.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.548
And zero purpose now that
you're retired, eh, bud?

04:58.048 --> 04:59.800
And Maisy
would never let you.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.843
But I would.

05:00.843 --> 05:01.969
- Ugh.
- Gross, Mom.

05:01.969 --> 05:04.430
Aw, thanks, guys.
You're the best!

05:04.430 --> 05:07.599
But Ulrika's presidency
was the worst.

05:07.599 --> 05:09.727
Years of fighting
over dock sizes

05:09.727 --> 05:11.353
and boating hours
took their toll.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.063
<i>No matter how hard she tried,</i>

05:13.063 --> 05:15.107
<i>docks got bigger,
boats got louder.</i>

05:15.107 --> 05:17.109
<i>It is all moot
without quorum.</i>

05:17.109 --> 05:18.235
<i>Shorelines receded faster.</i>

05:19.153 --> 05:20.487
And her Swedish tradition

05:20.487 --> 05:23.073
of Walpurgis,
if that's a word,

05:23.073 --> 05:25.200
was the perfect cover
for a controlled burn

05:25.200 --> 05:28.120
to reclaim the land
for Mother Gaia.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.040
I am sorry,
old and young Wallander,

05:31.040 --> 05:32.750
but you are Swede
out of luck.

05:35.711 --> 05:37.880
And I do not know
who this Fo-ee-bee is.

05:37.880 --> 05:40.132
Oh, but I do.

05:40.132 --> 05:43.135
And I was there when Jayne
came looking for Maisy,

05:43.135 --> 05:45.512
and I hate
the Boathouse the most,

05:45.512 --> 05:47.598
and I'm the only
femme fatale on the lake.

05:47.598 --> 05:49.183
But we did her already.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.018
- Yeah, I feel like
we did this already.
- I'm confused.

05:51.018 --> 05:52.311
Yeah, we did it, yeah.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.897
Maybe Billie burned down the
Boathouse to get with Riley.

05:54.897 --> 05:57.066
She has been drawn
to family figures.

05:57.066 --> 05:58.692
She did almost
bang her cousin.

05:58.692 --> 05:59.985
- Yeah.
- Step-cousin!

05:59.985 --> 06:01.445
That's why they
look so alike.

06:01.445 --> 06:03.614
Okay, guys, think.
Billie burns down the Boathouse

06:03.614 --> 06:06.075
because she knows that Riley
would never forgive Justin.

06:06.075 --> 06:07.618
And then, bam!

06:07.618 --> 06:08.952
The path is cleared.

06:09.495 --> 06:11.538
- That is so fucked.
- Tweet it.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.581
Oh!

06:12.581 --> 06:15.918
But there was
an even more obvious suspect.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.503
- Oh, yes.
- Four, in fact.

06:17.503 --> 06:20.672
And their mom was covering
for them the whole time.

06:20.672 --> 06:22.674
The Quadspawn knew
Jayne was driving

06:22.674 --> 06:24.593
Tegan and Sara,
and about the bidding war.

06:24.593 --> 06:25.969
And as the only ones
at the wedding

06:25.969 --> 06:27.930
who know how to use their phone,
they could've faceswapped

06:27.930 --> 06:29.807
- and framed anyone.
- That is true.

06:29.807 --> 06:31.225
- Yeah, we have done that.
- I could've done it.

06:31.225 --> 06:33.936
Or those baby plastics did it
just to feel something.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.063
- Just to feel anything at all.
- Hmm.

06:36.063 --> 06:38.774
I think we've heard enough
from Rizzoli and Isles!

06:38.774 --> 06:40.651
- Our show.
- You listen.

06:40.651 --> 06:43.153
There is no way
that my Anna Del-threes

06:43.153 --> 06:44.363
would've done this.

06:44.363 --> 06:46.156
There's four of us, Dad.

06:46.156 --> 06:47.658
- Hey!
- Or maybe...

06:47.658 --> 06:50.285
- maybe it was you, Wayne.
- No.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.162
Oh, yeah.
You're lookin' mean, sir.

06:52.162 --> 06:53.914
You had a motive.
You had the opportunity, too,

06:53.914 --> 06:55.207
- didn't you?
- Why?

06:55.207 --> 06:56.959
What motive
could Wayner have?

06:56.959 --> 06:58.377
Oh!

06:58.377 --> 07:00.796
As long as Jayne's
presidency was a mess,

07:00.796 --> 07:03.465
Wayne still had an opportunity
to win her back.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.967
I mean, he was there
for the wedding.

07:04.967 --> 07:06.510
<i>He was there
for the blown tires.</i>

07:06.510 --> 07:08.428
<i>He was there
for the phone call.</i>

07:08.428 --> 07:09.763
<i>Pow, pow!</i>

07:09.763 --> 07:12.015
- Yeah...
- Now,
all of that compulsive,

07:12.015 --> 07:13.433
excessive day drinking, well,

07:13.433 --> 07:15.394
<i>that just meant he wouldn't
remember a goddamn thing,</i>

07:15.394 --> 07:16.770
<i>wouldn't it, Wayne?</i>

07:18.063 --> 07:19.064
It's true.

07:20.649 --> 07:22.234
I don't remember anything.

07:22.234 --> 07:25.404
I will not let you
<i>Inception</i> my husband!

07:25.988 --> 07:26.989
She did it!

07:27.531 --> 07:30.993
Claire burned down the Boathouse
when Wayne turned her down.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.246
We all do crazy things
for the sex falcon.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.789
All right.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.542
Aww! Daddy defended us.

07:38.542 --> 07:42.087
No, guys,
Mom called Daddy "husband."

07:44.339 --> 07:45.465
What's wrong?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.593
Mom and Dad are totally
getting back together.

07:47.593 --> 07:50.137
I can't believe Olive's
going to jail!

07:50.137 --> 07:52.598
Claire Henderson!

07:54.892 --> 07:57.686
All comes down to you,
Claire Bear.

07:58.353 --> 08:01.273
A woman who hated
her stepmother so much

08:01.273 --> 08:04.735
that she would do anything
to avenge her jilted mom.

08:04.735 --> 08:06.153
<i>You had
a games night without us?</i>

08:06.153 --> 08:07.446
<i>Because the last one
you went to,</i>

08:07.446 --> 08:09.072
<i>you fucked Whoreen
and broke Mummy's heart.</i>

08:09.072 --> 08:11.033
By trying to
frame the one person

08:11.033 --> 08:12.993
she hates most
in this world.

08:12.993 --> 08:15.662
A sweet but
cringily horny woman, yes.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.831
My little girl's
not a firebug!

08:17.831 --> 08:20.667
She's a blunt instrument,
just like your mom.

08:20.667 --> 08:23.837
Hmm. What that woman could do
with a sock full of pennies.

08:24.630 --> 08:26.715
- What?
- I didn't frame Whoreen.

08:26.715 --> 08:29.259
Because she did it.
It's in my podcast.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.929
Come on, Claire. Whoreen could
never burn down the Boathouse.

08:31.929 --> 08:33.305
She's been
on the Board for years!

08:33.305 --> 08:34.932
Whoreen does
whatever we say.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.309
- No, she does
whatever you say.
- Well...

08:37.309 --> 08:39.770
- Whoreen collects
kitten sweatshirts.
- Really?

08:39.770 --> 08:42.147
Whoreen gets freaky
to Gordon Lightfoot.

08:43.398 --> 08:45.067
Whoreen makes
her own dessert wine!

08:47.319 --> 08:48.987
Maureen...

08:48.987 --> 08:50.822
- Zip it, Maureen.
- Not now, Whoreen!

08:50.822 --> 08:54.284
My name is Maureen!

08:56.370 --> 08:58.330
Twenty years.

08:58.330 --> 09:02.584
Twenty years you've called me
by that horrible name,

09:02.584 --> 09:06.630
all for loving a man
with a pendulous sack.

09:06.630 --> 09:07.839
- Ugh.
- Oh, God.

09:08.423 --> 09:11.760
Did you burn down
the Boathouse, Whoreen?

09:11.760 --> 09:15.138
I did.

09:15.138 --> 09:18.392
And made sure
it never came back!

09:18.934 --> 09:21.186
<i>- It's fine, they're not...
- Take it outside!</i>

09:21.186 --> 09:23.939
<i>I was just so miffed</i>

09:23.939 --> 09:27.359
<i>when my Canasta tournament
was bumped for Justin's wedding.</i>

09:27.359 --> 09:30.904
<i>Years of supporting everyone
on the Board,</i>

09:30.904 --> 09:34.574
<i>and as thanks,
that name on my seat!</i>

09:36.952 --> 09:39.788
<i>Watching everyone come together
for the boys' wedding,</i>

09:39.788 --> 09:41.790
<i>it was so unfair.</i>

09:42.833 --> 09:44.751
<i>Nobody came to our wedding.</i>

09:46.253 --> 09:48.964
<i>Even after Claire's mother
gave us her blessing.</i>

09:48.964 --> 09:53.802
Lou had just become too much
for her. She had tiny hands.

09:53.802 --> 09:55.012
Ugh!

09:55.012 --> 09:56.138
- Oh, God.
- Oh, my God.

09:56.138 --> 09:59.850
<i>As long as
there was a Boathouse,</i>

09:59.850 --> 10:02.728
<i>that name would never die.</i>

10:05.230 --> 10:10.110
<i>I would always be just a horny
homewrecker to you people!</i>

10:10.694 --> 10:13.655
<i>Well, this Niagara peach</i>

10:13.655 --> 10:16.616
<i>has been fucked
for the last time!</i>

10:21.705 --> 10:26.293
You will call me
by my name!

10:26.293 --> 10:27.210
Wow.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.888
So, yeah.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.681
- So I think this one's on us.
- Mm-hmm.

10:39.681 --> 10:41.933
We burnt down the Boathouse.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.310
All of us.

10:43.310 --> 10:46.146
Not me. I've always been
very sex-positive.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.939
And me.
Never called her that.

10:47.939 --> 10:49.900
I've been calling her Whoreen
since I was a kid.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.860
I never knew
your name was Kathleen.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.987
I called her Whoreen
at the Gas Go this morning.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.239
She's saved as Whoreen
in my phone.

10:56.239 --> 10:58.575
I call her Whoreen
at cards.

10:58.575 --> 11:01.286
- Sometimes in bed, I...
- That's allowed.

11:03.246 --> 11:04.873
We really should've
done better.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.959
Can you ever
forgive us, Maureen?

11:07.959 --> 11:10.796
You are not buying
any of this horseshit, are you?

11:10.796 --> 11:12.631
Yeah. I mean...

11:12.631 --> 11:14.091
- I think that's
what's happening.
- Sounds good to me.

11:14.091 --> 11:15.425
Unbelievable.

11:18.220 --> 11:21.515
<i>♪ A little lonely
but legit now ♪</i>

11:22.474 --> 11:25.977
<i>♪ You shine the light
I know I'm getting out ♪</i>

11:26.895 --> 11:31.858
<i>♪ I will remember your name
Your name, your name ♪</i>

11:31.858 --> 11:34.486
Oh, well, this would be a good
spot for the new Boathouse.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.655
Or there.
Better water access.

11:36.655 --> 11:37.739
Bush Prom.

11:39.074 --> 11:40.325
Is this why you were
rushing the drama?

11:40.325 --> 11:41.952
- Maybe.
- Folks!

11:41.952 --> 11:45.080
This is still
tree planter land till sunrise,

11:45.080 --> 11:48.333
so that is
a no good on the tour.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.253
But, if you're down to clown
on our last night here,

11:51.253 --> 11:54.172
let me be the first
to officially welcome you...

11:54.172 --> 11:55.507
to Bush Prom.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.300
Is there anything
he can't pull off?

11:57.300 --> 11:58.260
All right, y'all.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.762
We've got a couple of
ground rules to get through

12:00.762 --> 12:02.139
before the band plays.

12:02.139 --> 12:04.891
Rule number one:
no dance battles.

12:04.891 --> 12:06.977
Why are you looking at me?
Why is he looking at me?

12:06.977 --> 12:10.105
And as per
Bush Prom tradition,

12:10.105 --> 12:11.982
guys wear dresses,

12:11.982 --> 12:14.234
ladies wear tuxes.

12:16.945 --> 12:20.282
It's better if I pick for them.
Not everyone can work a ruffle.

12:22.576 --> 12:25.454
<i>♪ No doubts, no fears
Just confidence...</i>

12:25.454 --> 12:29.040
Okay, okay.
You guys look dope.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.126
Welcome to the party.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.132
Beer's this way!
Over here!

12:40.677 --> 12:42.512
So, uh, friend,

12:42.512 --> 12:45.432
um, there's nothing in here
that's my size.

12:45.432 --> 12:47.392
Is there, like,
another friend

12:47.392 --> 12:48.894
that I could swap with,
you know?

12:48.894 --> 12:50.187
I'm just asking...
just asking,

12:50.187 --> 12:51.354
- you know, as like, a...
- Friend.

12:52.022 --> 12:52.939
Got it.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.067
You breakin' up with me,
Kombuch?

12:56.067 --> 12:59.237
I think. I don't know.
I've never done it before.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.740
- How am I doing?
- Oh, you're crushin' it.

13:01.740 --> 13:04.743
But you and Ivy
are the only ones left to swap.

13:05.368 --> 13:07.662
Yeah, I don't think
that would go well.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.540
It is the last day
of camp.

13:11.249 --> 13:13.293
Puts people
in a forgiving mood.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.297
Friends?

13:23.553 --> 13:24.429
Definitely.

13:26.223 --> 13:27.349
You got this.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.017
She's by the mess tent.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.227
Thanks.

13:31.561 --> 13:32.395
It's the other...

13:34.314 --> 13:36.483
- She'll figure it out.
- Victor, honey?

13:36.483 --> 13:38.652
Hey, Maisies.
In here.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.280
- Oh, God.
- This is Krusty Jake.

13:42.280 --> 13:44.157
Oh, my friends
call me KJ.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.700
That'll never happen.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.285
Have you lost your mind?

13:47.285 --> 13:48.787
Why are you
getting a tattoo

13:48.787 --> 13:50.705
from a dirty hippie
in a sarong?

13:50.705 --> 13:53.041
This is actually good
for air circulation, so...

13:53.041 --> 13:55.335
Finally found my tattoo
for the year, hon.

13:55.335 --> 13:58.338
"Most Victor Player."

13:59.214 --> 14:01.967
I told you to come to me
when Daddy has ideas.

14:01.967 --> 14:03.635
I was looking so hard
for a symbol

14:03.635 --> 14:05.762
to mark my year
that I lost myself!

14:05.762 --> 14:07.472
Happens all the time, dude.

14:07.973 --> 14:09.558
I'm a three-time
hockey champ,

14:09.558 --> 14:11.393
bangin' husband,
kickass dad.

14:11.393 --> 14:13.061
I could have gotten away
with the Boathouse fire

14:13.061 --> 14:14.729
because everyone loves me!

14:14.729 --> 14:16.439
Next time
I forget how amazing I am,

14:16.439 --> 14:19.276
I'll just give myself a little
pat on the back to remember!

14:19.276 --> 14:20.443
You wanna take a look?

14:20.443 --> 14:21.861
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay.

14:23.029 --> 14:24.573
Where's MVP?

14:24.573 --> 14:26.199
Daddy got a tramp stamp.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.578
After what happened to Maureen,
it felt right to reclaim it.

14:29.578 --> 14:30.996
So we never forget.

14:31.830 --> 14:32.664
Hmm.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.127
Small sips or you'll barf.

14:38.461 --> 14:39.713
Okay, more for me.

14:40.755 --> 14:42.340
Gonna need it
for this next bit anyways.

14:46.386 --> 14:48.513
Ivy, I'm really sorry.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.850
I've never had feelings for a
girl before, and half the time,

14:51.850 --> 14:53.643
I didn't know if I wanted
to kiss you or fight you.

14:53.643 --> 14:55.103
You don't have to
give a whole PSA.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.563
You're not into girls,
I get it.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.148
I'm still
figuring out what I'm into.

14:58.148 --> 15:00.066
But I know I like you,

15:00.066 --> 15:02.777
and I know I still wanna
make an impact like you.

15:02.777 --> 15:05.530
You and Forrest just made tree
planting look so cool, I got...

15:05.530 --> 15:08.199
- It is.
- And I'm not, clearly.

15:08.867 --> 15:11.870
But... spending the summer
outside with you

15:11.870 --> 15:13.580
made me less scared of it.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.374
In my family, nature's kind of
something you enjoy inside.

15:16.374 --> 15:18.543
Mine told me I was
allergic to pollen

15:18.543 --> 15:20.670
my entire childhood, so...

15:22.130 --> 15:23.715
Ivy, I never meant
to hurt you.

15:23.715 --> 15:26.301
I know.
I was just bummed.

15:26.301 --> 15:28.928
I know I can be super intense,
like, 24/7,

15:28.928 --> 15:31.973
but I can be fun, too.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.142
I can get wild.

15:34.142 --> 15:35.185
Sort of.

15:36.561 --> 15:37.854
Then dance with me.

15:53.203 --> 15:54.245
Oh.

15:56.873 --> 16:00.418
Don't worry, she'll be catnip
for the ladies in the clink.

16:01.211 --> 16:03.338
Or you could always
take the fall for her.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.549
Actually, the Board
decided not to press charges.

16:06.549 --> 16:08.301
Oh. Well, that's too bad.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.553
I still think prison
would be good for you.

16:10.553 --> 16:13.014
What else does your lonely heart
have to look forward to?

16:13.014 --> 16:15.642
Same as you:
just the sweet release of death.

16:18.144 --> 16:21.690
Aww. I always
did admire your fire.

16:21.690 --> 16:24.025
So glad
you passed it to Billie.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.902
She channels it
so much better.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.905
Oh! If you'll excuse me,

16:28.905 --> 16:32.158
a Parisian smoke show
is about to ask me to dance.

the waffles were shit.

17:07.318 --> 17:08.319
You look good.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.281
I trimmed.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.158
But you stopped
below the neck.

17:13.158 --> 17:14.868
No, the 'stache stays.

17:15.535 --> 17:18.371
How about the earring?
Is that a phase, or a bird trap?

17:18.371 --> 17:20.790

18:43.331 --> 18:44.958
Call me bush crazy,

18:44.958 --> 18:46.876
but this season was the shit!

18:49.671 --> 18:53.299
I wanna see all of your asses
back next season.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.928
- All right!
- Not you, Krusty.
We've seen enough of yours.

18:56.928 --> 18:59.597
Thank you so much
for pounding so hard.

18:59.597 --> 19:01.850
Happy Bush Prom,
highballers!

19:04.143 --> 19:06.062
Can I steal
the mic a sec?

19:06.938 --> 19:08.356
Hello, hi.

19:08.356 --> 19:11.317
I'd like to make a toast
to the new Boathouse,

19:11.317 --> 19:13.736
and restorative justice
for Maureen!

19:16.447 --> 19:18.741
I know, I know.
You're probably thinking,

19:18.741 --> 19:22.036
"How can there be justice
after one horny woman's

19:22.036 --> 19:23.788
criminally desperate
attempt at validation

19:23.788 --> 19:25.248
cost us the Boathouse?"

19:25.915 --> 19:28.084
But sometimes,

19:28.084 --> 19:30.837
we don't realize
the part we play in

19:30.837 --> 19:32.547
making somebody else
the villain,

19:32.547 --> 19:34.757
and how we become
a villain ourselves.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.885
To new beginnings!

19:44.976 --> 19:48.021
That apology was
wasted on Whoreen.

19:48.813 --> 19:50.231
You really are a monster.

19:50.231 --> 19:53.234
I know I wasn't
the mother you needed.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.612
But I led
the life I wanted,

19:55.612 --> 19:56.946
and you do too.

19:56.946 --> 19:58.072
So you're welcome.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.620
As promised.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.837
Oh, heads up.
Without the Boathouse payout,

20:12.837 --> 20:15.465
I needed a bigger cushion
for my farewell tour,

20:15.465 --> 20:18.843
so I took out
a teensy $950k equity

20:18.843 --> 20:21.054
- from the cottage.
- You did what?

20:21.054 --> 20:24.015
Well, Devanté wasn't

20:24.015 --> 20:25.224
But don't freak out!

20:25.892 --> 20:29.228
You're not an only child
anymore, remember?

20:34.317 --> 20:36.986
Don't play with
your food too long.

20:38.488 --> 20:40.114
Now, if you'll excuse me,

20:40.114 --> 20:42.784
I hear there's
a promising tattoo artist

20:42.784 --> 20:44.577
that gives good stick.

20:44.577 --> 20:46.371
And poke.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.414
Oh, my God.

20:49.457 --> 20:50.750
So much fun!

20:57.215 --> 20:58.716
Did you just have a stroke,

20:58.716 --> 21:00.385
or did I see you
hug your mother?

21:00.385 --> 21:04.847
Seemed only fair,
because she gave me this.

21:07.684 --> 21:08.768
You finally did it.

21:09.477 --> 21:11.771
You finally
got my family cottage.

21:12.522 --> 21:13.523
Maisy wins.

21:13.982 --> 21:17.026
She always, always wins.

21:17.568 --> 21:21.656
My mom's dying wish is
for me to share it with you.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.533
Oh, my God, is that a joke?
Are you joking?

21:23.533 --> 21:26.828
I guess there really is a human
under that lizard skin.

21:26.828 --> 21:28.705
Well, can you handle
a 50/50 split?

21:28.705 --> 21:30.665
60/40. There's four of us
and two of you.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.417
Okay. Yes!
That's fine.

21:32.417 --> 21:34.002
Shake on it, little bro.

21:35.378 --> 21:37.630
Psych!
No, I'm serious.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.966
That grip!

21:39.966 --> 21:42.885
It's like a python
wrapped around my hand.

21:47.724 --> 21:49.892

21:59.902 --> 22:02.572
Oh, but isn't
going back to your dad,

22:02.572 --> 22:03.865

22:03.865 --> 22:05.992
No, you're not

about you
in the last newsletter.

22:27.388 --> 22:29.515
Well,
I checked your sources,

22:29.515 --> 22:31.559
and I thought
it was pretty fair.

22:34.979 --> 22:35.980
I'm sorry, too.

22:36.981 --> 22:38.441

23:19.607 --> 23:21.484
I mean, I got my mom
to pee in the woods,

23:21.484 --> 23:23.861
and CEO of my own startup
would look pretty killer

23:23.861 --> 23:25.154
