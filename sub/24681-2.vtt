00:01.815 --> 00:04.340
<i>In New York City's
war on crime,</i>

00:04.418 --> 00:06.477
<i>the worst criminal offenders
are pursued</i>

00:06.553 --> 00:09.283
<i>by the detectives
of the Major Case Squad.</i>

00:09.423 --> 00:11.414
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:13.060 --> 00:14.960
Taking the photographs
made me understand

00:15.028 --> 00:17.462
how my mother
helped these people.

00:17.731 --> 00:19.198
I was always
afraid of hospitals,

00:19.266 --> 00:22.167
but now I want
to be a trauma doctor.

00:22.436 --> 00:24.199
Very good,
Nichelle.

00:24.538 --> 00:28.030
Photography can make us
more sensitive to our fears.

00:28.975 --> 00:31.773
That's how we heal
the scars of the past.

00:31.978 --> 00:34.446
Mr. Heltman, considering
your photos exploit women,

00:34.514 --> 00:37.074
do you believe you're the best
role model for young people?

00:37.150 --> 00:40.085
Nichelle, this is what
you say to critics.

00:41.088 --> 00:45.286
Art demands no explanation.

00:47.728 --> 00:52.256
Gretta, I need you
to stop feeling so much.

00:52.332 --> 00:55.631
Somebody powder her off.
Five minutes!

00:56.370 --> 00:58.565
Martin, can I get some...

00:58.638 --> 01:00.196
I found this on top of your bag.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:13.186 --> 01:14.448
Please call my wife.

01:14.521 --> 01:17.718
Tell her I can't be at
Pavel's opening tonight.

01:18.258 --> 01:22.251
Now let's get this shot
before we all die of old age!

01:22.329 --> 01:23.956
Everyone else,
get out!

01:35.275 --> 01:36.572
I'm fine!

01:36.977 --> 01:39.172
Just give me a moment!

01:43.417 --> 01:44.975
You look tired.

01:45.919 --> 01:47.614
Haven't you slept?

01:47.954 --> 01:49.922
You want some
breakfast?

01:50.757 --> 01:52.816
Hannah, I want
to go home.

01:53.493 --> 01:55.791
Home? This is our home.

01:59.199 --> 02:01.099
You mean to Germany?

02:02.235 --> 02:03.634
When?
Now.

02:04.271 --> 02:07.798
Today. It's finished for me here.

02:08.475 --> 02:11.535
But I was looking...
Hannah, please. Please.

02:18.452 --> 02:19.646
Why do you
put up with him?

02:19.719 --> 02:22.187
Your father is an artist.

02:22.756 --> 02:24.587
That's just
his pretext.

02:25.759 --> 02:27.818
He owes us
an explanation.

02:30.464 --> 02:32.295
And I'll get one.

02:34.067 --> 02:37.798
Absolutely not! I refuse
to become involved with...

02:38.405 --> 02:40.339
Ugh! You wouldn't do that.

02:44.411 --> 02:46.311
Okay, yes. I'll come.

02:48.548 --> 02:51.745
Are you sure you want to
give these to the museum?

02:53.653 --> 02:55.780
It's time to let them go.

02:56.990 --> 03:00.653
I have to pick up something
from the studio. I'll be back.

03:01.661 --> 03:04.721
<i>Central, we got a vehicle
accident with a 10-54,</i>

03:04.798 --> 03:06.789
southbound on the
West Side Highway.

03:06.867 --> 03:08.391
At 23rd Street. This
guy flew right past me

03:08.468 --> 03:09.662
weaving all
over the place.

03:09.736 --> 03:13.035
I saw the whole thing.
He never even hit his brakes.

04:11.331 --> 04:14.630
We estimate his rate
of speed at 60 miles per hour.

04:14.701 --> 04:16.225
No skid marks.

04:16.303 --> 04:19.829
One of my guys said that Mr.
Heltman was some kind of shutterbug?

04:19.906 --> 04:21.702
Famous one.
Fashion magazines.

04:21.774 --> 04:24.335
Women in leather
bikinis and stilettos.

04:26.980 --> 04:30.143
He should've been able to
steer, even in handcuffs,

04:30.216 --> 04:32.343
if he wasn't
drunk or stoned.

04:33.486 --> 04:35.420
I don't smell alcohol.

04:37.057 --> 04:39.218
He didn't get that
from hitting the door.

04:39.292 --> 04:40.884
There's blood
on the headrest.

04:40.961 --> 04:43.794
He might have been injured
before the accident.

04:44.598 --> 04:47.465
There's some kind
of foam residue on this.

04:48.401 --> 04:50.801
Piece of wood was wedged
against the accelerator.

04:50.870 --> 04:51.996
His engine was racing.

04:52.072 --> 04:54.233
Popped the emergency brake
and off he went.

04:54.307 --> 04:58.141
With that head wound, he might
have been barely conscious.

04:58.211 --> 05:00.475
As murders go,
it's pretty flashy.

05:00.547 --> 05:02.276
Could be the point.

05:07.253 --> 05:11.087
Did your husband do that often,
go out at night to his studio?

05:11.157 --> 05:14.456
Yes, he went out maybe
two or three times

05:14.527 --> 05:16.495
a week to work
in the darkroom.

05:16.696 --> 05:19.494
What difference does it make?
He had a car accident.

05:19.566 --> 05:22.763
We think that there
was another party involved.

05:22.836 --> 05:24.770
He was handcuffed.

05:25.872 --> 05:28.363
And someone had
tampered with the car.

05:28.541 --> 05:30.031
Handcuffed?

05:31.611 --> 05:34.546
Who would do that?
Who would hurt Gerhardt?

05:35.048 --> 05:39.951
We're sorry to ask, but could he
have been involved with someone?

05:40.487 --> 05:42.717
My father lived
like he had no family.

05:42.789 --> 05:44.757
Daniel, that's not true.

05:46.026 --> 05:48.517
I understood
my husband's needs,

05:48.595 --> 05:52.929
but his work was
his only mistress.

05:53.433 --> 05:58.132
His photography
celebrates strong women.

05:58.204 --> 06:00.035
He wasn't tolerant of weakness,

06:00.106 --> 06:03.007
of people who let
themselves be victimized.

06:06.813 --> 06:08.007
You're moving?

06:08.081 --> 06:11.380
My father was taking
my mother back to Germany.

06:11.451 --> 06:13.043
This decision was recent?

06:13.119 --> 06:14.609
Two nights ago.

06:14.988 --> 06:17.616
He came home late and
said he was finished here.

06:17.691 --> 06:19.625
With what,
his work?

06:19.693 --> 06:22.184
He didn't explain.

06:22.262 --> 06:25.425
Maybe it was the city.
He was never comfortable.

06:25.498 --> 06:27.125
These uniforms...

06:29.069 --> 06:31.765
They're from
concentration camps?

06:32.372 --> 06:34.499
Gerhardt's parents
were survivors.

06:34.574 --> 06:38.408
When he talked about people who
let themselves be victimized,

06:39.245 --> 06:41.873
he didn't include
his parents, did he?

06:42.415 --> 06:46.977
He was very angry that people would
let such a thing happen to them.

06:49.089 --> 06:52.149
This box, it's marked
"Holocaust Museum. "

06:52.959 --> 06:54.688
He was giving these away?

06:54.828 --> 06:56.728
I'm keeping them now.

06:58.965 --> 07:05.393
I want to hold onto
as much of him as I can.

07:09.743 --> 07:13.907
I'm pretty sure he wasn't here that
night. He usually leaves a mess.

07:15.248 --> 07:16.374
What about
this cot?

07:16.449 --> 07:18.144
It was like that
when I came in.

07:18.218 --> 07:20.118
Did it
get much use?

07:20.186 --> 07:23.178
Gerhardt had his flings,
but he was not a romantic.

07:23.256 --> 07:26.123
That's my desk. When can
I get my stuff out of here?

07:26.192 --> 07:28.422
We'll be done
by tomorrow.

07:28.495 --> 07:31.259
He told his wife he wanted
to move back to Germany.

07:31.331 --> 07:32.821
Did he talk
to you about that?

07:32.899 --> 07:33.991
Briefly.

07:34.067 --> 07:36.627
You expected it.
Your résumé?

07:37.537 --> 07:39.437
Gerhardt was
losing his edge.

07:39.506 --> 07:41.337
His work had
become mechanical.

07:43.343 --> 07:46.710
Sounds like he got bored,
maybe needed a little jolt.

07:47.147 --> 07:49.741
Two nights ago, when he decided
to move, do you know where he was?

07:49.816 --> 07:53.274
They were supposed to go to an
opening, but he got a note and bailed.

07:53.353 --> 07:55.583
We were doing a shoot
in Cooper Square.

07:55.655 --> 07:58.488
Somebody left a note
on his shooting bag.

07:58.858 --> 08:00.189
What was in the note?

08:00.260 --> 08:02.854
I don't know. He never let me see them.

08:05.365 --> 08:07.925
Them? It happened before?

08:08.434 --> 08:10.834
Three times over
the last five months.

08:10.904 --> 08:12.303
I've never seen
who leaves them.

08:13.273 --> 08:14.501
No note.

08:21.614 --> 08:23.844
Looks like ash
from a fire.

08:25.218 --> 08:27.448
Any chance you picked
this up on the shoot?

08:27.520 --> 08:31.320
No. The bag was on his chair.
It never touched the ground.

08:31.391 --> 08:33.416
There's drive-in
access to his studio

08:33.493 --> 08:35.154
all the way up
to the 11th floor.

08:35.227 --> 08:36.660
Heltman always
drove his car up,

08:36.729 --> 08:39.596
but there's no record he
used his keycard that night.

08:39.666 --> 08:41.190
There's a lot of leather
in Mr. Heltman's photos.

08:41.267 --> 08:43.097
He into anything rough?
Not according to his wife.

08:43.169 --> 08:44.500
And there were no
marks on his body,

08:44.571 --> 08:46.505
just the wounds
from the accident.

08:46.573 --> 08:49.474
And this, on the
left side of his head.

08:49.542 --> 08:50.839
This cross-hatching, he got whacked

08:50.910 --> 08:53.003
by somebody swinging
a piece of rebar.

08:53.079 --> 08:56.014
You check any other angles?
Money problems?

08:56.082 --> 08:57.674
Maybe somebody got
offended by his photos?

08:57.750 --> 08:59.741
His finances
are spotless.

08:59.819 --> 09:03.516
And the last angry letter
he got was five years ago.

09:03.590 --> 09:07.117
That was the problem.
He stopped being provocative.

09:07.193 --> 09:11.857
He came to a creative dead end,
started making life-changing decisions.

09:12.398 --> 09:16.892
The foam on the two-by-four
is fire-suppression foam

09:16.970 --> 09:18.995
used by the
fire department.

09:19.572 --> 09:22.370
The two-by-four came
from the scene of a fire,

09:22.442 --> 09:25.741
same as the ash on the bag
he had the night before.

09:25.812 --> 09:28.178
He might've been at the
same place both nights.

09:28.248 --> 09:30.182
The ash was found
to contain cobalt.

09:30.250 --> 09:33.845
Now, cobalt is used as a
drying catalyst in printing.

09:34.721 --> 09:35.915
Printing company?

09:35.989 --> 09:38.184
Check with the
fire department.

09:38.258 --> 09:41.056
Start with fires this
year in all five boroughs.

09:43.563 --> 09:45.292
Detective,
we've got tire prints.

09:45.365 --> 09:48.766
Same make and model as on
Mr. Heltman's SUV over here.

09:48.835 --> 09:51.360
We got some blood
mixed with ash here.

09:51.437 --> 09:55.373
Someone made an effort to
cover it up. And there's this.

09:57.043 --> 09:59.603
There's blood
and hair on this end.

09:59.679 --> 10:01.476
All right,
good work.

10:01.814 --> 10:03.338
We're going to need
a work-up in here.

10:03.416 --> 10:05.850
Somebody got sick
in the bathroom.

10:05.919 --> 10:09.787
They found a piece of rebar
with blood and hair on it.

10:11.925 --> 10:14.052
He was attacked

10:16.095 --> 10:17.687
and put back
in his car.

10:17.764 --> 10:20.995
And they drove him to the
city for the big finale.

10:21.067 --> 10:22.534
Whatever the attraction was here,

10:22.602 --> 10:25.332
I hope he thought
it was worth it.

10:28.875 --> 10:30.206
Makeup.

10:34.314 --> 10:35.576
Putrane.

10:37.717 --> 10:40.584
Decomp.
We need a cadaver dog.

10:46.559 --> 10:48.584
There was definitely
a body on this couch.

10:48.661 --> 10:51.721
Homer gave a strong alert, so I'd
say the decomp was well underway.

10:51.798 --> 10:52.890
Twelve hours,
at least.

10:52.966 --> 10:54.934
How recently
was the body here?

10:55.001 --> 10:57.162
The fact that you picked
up the smell off the scarf,

10:57.236 --> 10:58.260
I'd say pretty recent.

10:58.338 --> 11:00.431
Thank you.
You, too, Homer.

11:00.740 --> 11:04.301
A body. No wonder Gerhardt
wanted to get out of Dodge.

11:04.377 --> 11:07.642
The scarf was worn by the
victim, probably a woman.

11:08.581 --> 11:12.540
Maybe she died partying with
Gerhardt and one of his buddies.

11:12.618 --> 11:14.677
He came back the next night
to get rid of the body,

11:14.754 --> 11:16.813
they got into
an argument...

11:16.889 --> 11:20.416
The note that Gerhardt
received, it was the fourth one.

11:20.626 --> 11:22.150
Other parties?

11:22.228 --> 11:26.130
Let's hope with happier
endings. Somebody bake a potato?

11:30.403 --> 11:33.099
It's residue,
I don't know what it is.

11:34.007 --> 11:36.339
A smell you can't identify.

11:39.012 --> 11:43.346
Flash powder? No, no, no, Gerhardt
used electronic flash, strobe lights.

11:43.416 --> 11:45.316
He was a technophile.

11:45.385 --> 11:51.722
We found this tinfoil with residue
of magnesium and potassium chlorate.

11:52.625 --> 11:57.085
Maybe he was experimenting with it
to get a special lighting effect.

11:57.163 --> 11:59.791
It was found in an abandoned
building in Brooklyn,

11:59.866 --> 12:03.358
along with evidence that your husband
was there before he was killed.

12:03.436 --> 12:08.066
We also found a woman's
scarf, photographic makeup.

12:08.141 --> 12:10.109
There might've been a model,
you know, a photo shoot.

12:10.176 --> 12:14.408
No, no, no, Gerhardt would have told
me if he was working on something new.

12:14.480 --> 12:15.708
Well, there might
have been other sessions.

12:15.782 --> 12:18.649
We'll need to look at his
negatives and prints.

12:18.718 --> 12:19.776
What about
the refrigerator?

12:19.852 --> 12:23.288
I mean, don't photographers
keep film in the refrigerator?

12:23.356 --> 12:25.950
Unexposed
film, not negatives.

12:26.826 --> 12:31.627
Well, your father was using
unusual lighting techniques,

12:31.731 --> 12:35.098
maybe he used
unusual film.

12:49.115 --> 12:51.879
Does this look
unusual to you?

13:03.763 --> 13:06.527
Um... Made in Germany.
You recognize these?

13:06.599 --> 13:10.467
I never saw them. It's not
even a format Gerhardt used.

13:10.536 --> 13:12.834
Well, I don't know
the manufacturer.

13:12.905 --> 13:14.202
Have you ever
seen them before?

13:14.273 --> 13:15.297
They went out of business.

13:15.374 --> 13:18.605
They made photographic
supplies for the Nazis.

13:18.678 --> 13:21.203
They used Jewish slaves
in their factories.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.271
To make this film.

13:23.916 --> 13:28.512
Well, sometimes artists use materials
with symbolic value, isn't that true?

13:29.122 --> 13:30.214
Yeah, it's true.

13:30.289 --> 13:34.350
Well, your father, he shot
in a burned-out building,

13:34.427 --> 13:39.524
he used old lighting
techniques, maybe this film.

13:39.699 --> 13:40.996
You can't think of what he photographed?

13:41.067 --> 13:42.295
I have no idea.

13:42.368 --> 13:45.201
Could it have something to do with
his parents in the concentration camps?

13:45.271 --> 13:47.569
No! I never heard
of such a project.

13:47.640 --> 13:50.973
I don't want to think about
this. You talk to them.

13:51.043 --> 13:55.070
We don't know what my father was
doing. He kept so many secrets.

13:57.450 --> 14:00.283
Excuse me, I'm going to
make sure she's all right.

14:02.155 --> 14:05.613
And whatever he shot,
he'd keep it in a safe place.

14:05.691 --> 14:09.525
This is old film, it's
probably very unstable.

14:10.463 --> 14:14.627
The negative would be kept in a
climate-controlled environment.

14:14.734 --> 14:16.326
Mmm. An archival
storage vault.

14:16.402 --> 14:21.032
Got to be at least one in the city that
meets Gerhardt's exacting standards.

14:24.377 --> 14:27.608
It's the
wrong size film.

14:28.214 --> 14:30.546
Whose photos are these?

14:30.683 --> 14:32.878
That's Kissel.
Andreas Kissel.

14:36.088 --> 14:37.885
I think I found them.

15:00.746 --> 15:04.238
The couch from the printing
company and the scarf.

15:04.450 --> 15:07.647
Gerhardt hid them under
another name for a reason.

15:09.855 --> 15:12.050
We're just not seeing why.

15:15.761 --> 15:18.389
The assignment is to find
an exhibit of an artist

15:18.464 --> 15:22.730
whose work you think will be
important 100 years from now.

15:23.903 --> 15:26.394
Go. Have a nice weekend.

15:30.676 --> 15:34.112
Excuse me? You're Gerhardt
Heltman's son, aren't you?

15:35.448 --> 15:38.178
I just want to tell you how sorry I am.

15:38.251 --> 15:39.309
Thank you.

15:39.385 --> 15:40.545
I was wondering,

15:40.620 --> 15:41.780
do you know when
we can expect

15:41.854 --> 15:44.220
his latest work
to be exhibited?

15:44.290 --> 15:46.383
I hear it's controversial.

15:47.994 --> 15:50.360
I don't know anything
about it. Excuse me.

15:50.429 --> 15:52.454
But you would be involved
in any exhibition.

15:52.531 --> 15:53.520
I mean, you would
have an obligation

15:53.599 --> 15:55.931
as an art historian,
as his son...

15:56.002 --> 15:59.335
I told you, I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:01.240 --> 16:03.902
The girl on the couch
is Marla Kelly.

16:03.976 --> 16:08.037
Her parents reported her missing
the same day Gerhardt died.

16:09.782 --> 16:10.908
It's a close match.

16:10.983 --> 16:12.348
She's
a pretty girl.

16:12.418 --> 16:14.443
None of these girls look
like professional models,

16:14.520 --> 16:16.954
but Gerhardt knew how
to photograph them.

16:17.023 --> 16:19.583
Unlike the women
in his other work,

16:20.293 --> 16:25.492
here we have a sense
of vulnerability.

16:38.778 --> 16:40.769
What's the matter?
You okay?

16:40.846 --> 16:42.313
The eyes.

16:45.985 --> 16:48.749
At first I thought
it was a lighting trick.

16:48.821 --> 16:50.550
Discoloration.

16:51.691 --> 16:53.090
Tache noire.

16:53.459 --> 16:56.451
That's the whites of their eyes
turning brown from exposure to the air.

16:56.529 --> 16:58.656
And they all have it.

16:58.731 --> 17:00.358
They're all dead.

17:05.671 --> 17:08.571
He killed them and then
took photos of them.

17:09.308 --> 17:12.471
Can hold a pose for
hours and not complain.

17:12.811 --> 17:14.643
The perfect models.

17:21.454 --> 17:25.515
No. I don't know
any of these girls.

17:25.590 --> 17:27.991
Gerhardt had nothing
to do with these photos.

17:28.060 --> 17:30.790
The photos were stored under
the name Andreas Kissel.

17:30.863 --> 17:32.592
Wasn't that
his grandfather?

17:32.665 --> 17:35.759
But these poor
women are all wrong.

17:35.835 --> 17:40.295
They're insubstantial.
This is not Gerhardt's work.

17:40.473 --> 17:42.668
Maybe they're different because
the person who killed him

17:42.742 --> 17:44.175
helped him take
these pictures.

17:44.243 --> 17:47.770
They might have left a mark.
It might help us find him.

17:48.714 --> 17:51.274
These marbles
in each photo.

17:51.350 --> 17:54.615
The ones on the tile floor
here and in her hand,

17:55.788 --> 17:59.690
you ever seen anything like
this in his work before?

18:00.259 --> 18:02.352
Keep looking
at the photos.

18:04.063 --> 18:06.088
You're remembering something?

18:11.303 --> 18:16.502
People were always sending Gerhardt
samples of their work for his comments,

18:16.575 --> 18:22.309
and there was a letter
he received last fall

18:22.381 --> 18:26.875
with some sketches and a
proposal for a photo essay.

18:26.952 --> 18:29.785
Uh... Just set them down
on the desk, please.

18:40.533 --> 18:41.557
I don't see a letter.

18:41.634 --> 18:42.760
It should be
with the sketches.

18:42.835 --> 18:44.200
I don't understand.

18:44.270 --> 18:47.137
Do you remember a name or
where the letter came from?

18:47.206 --> 18:49.538
No. I would just show
Gerhardt the letters

18:49.608 --> 18:52.873
and then he'd tell me if
he wanted to make contact.

18:52.945 --> 18:54.936
That's how
it was with us.

19:03.756 --> 19:05.690
You find
them inspiring?

19:05.758 --> 19:07.749
No, no, not inspiring.

19:08.561 --> 19:09.892
Familiar.

19:13.332 --> 19:15.095
Detective magazines.

19:15.968 --> 19:18.095
I remember my old man
having these when I was a kid.

19:18.170 --> 19:21.435
Damsels in distress.
Popular theme.

19:21.507 --> 19:24.340
And most men want
to rescue the damsel.

19:25.945 --> 19:28.470
And then there are those who
don't want her rescued at all.

19:28.547 --> 19:33.951
Sexual sadists who enjoy
depictions of captive women.

19:35.621 --> 19:36.986
Somewhere in there,

19:37.056 --> 19:38.990
Heltman and this other guy
had a meeting of the minds.

19:39.058 --> 19:42.858
Except there's nothing to suggest
Heltman was a sexual sadist.

19:42.928 --> 19:44.725
And in his photos,

19:45.931 --> 19:49.697
he portrays women
sympathetically.

19:50.803 --> 19:52.498
You feel for them.

19:52.571 --> 19:54.471
In this guy's sketches,

19:55.474 --> 19:58.272
the victims are objects of pleasure.

19:59.078 --> 20:02.377
And judging by his style, he's young.

20:03.182 --> 20:04.911
He's still forging his identity.

20:04.984 --> 20:07.282
Any idea of where his victims
might have intersected with him?

20:07.353 --> 20:08.411
Bars? Clubs?

20:08.487 --> 20:12.924
All we know is all four women
were new in town, lived alone,

20:13.492 --> 20:16.461
and all were reported
missing by a parent.

20:19.565 --> 20:21.829
She was a shy girl.

20:21.901 --> 20:24.802
But she didn't mind
doing things on her own.

20:25.504 --> 20:27.563
Like going
to the opera?

20:27.873 --> 20:31.536
She went to Lincoln Center two
days before she disappeared.

20:31.944 --> 20:33.241
A Sunday matinee.

20:33.312 --> 20:34.472
She loved it.

20:34.547 --> 20:38.108
She was always telling me about
the different museums she'd been to,

20:38.183 --> 20:40.151
the plays...

20:41.153 --> 20:42.552
She was happy here.

20:42.621 --> 20:43.986
She loved the arts.

20:46.692 --> 20:49.684
Did she know any
artists or photographers?

20:49.762 --> 20:50.956
No.

20:52.998 --> 20:54.397
Excuse me.

20:57.570 --> 20:59.834
One of the other
victims went to dance classes

20:59.905 --> 21:02.339
two blocks from
Lincoln Center.

21:03.876 --> 21:07.676
Here. Ellen Welpton, she took
a class Saturday afternoon,

21:07.746 --> 21:09.373
three days before
she disappeared.

21:09.448 --> 21:11.973
Well, Melissa Wiley, the
weekend before she disappeared,

21:12.051 --> 21:14.611
she bought CDs from
a store on Columbus.

21:14.687 --> 21:16.086
And Janet McBride.

21:16.255 --> 21:19.418
She bought a movie ticket at
Lincoln Plaza on a Sunday afternoon.

21:19.491 --> 21:22.619
So four victims were in the
same area of Columbus Avenue

21:22.695 --> 21:25.823
on a weekend afternoon
before they disappeared.

21:26.365 --> 21:28.265
No restaurant
or bar charges.

21:28.534 --> 21:30.297
They might have met
him on the street.

21:30.369 --> 21:32.098
Well, he would have needed
time to talk to them,

21:32.171 --> 21:34.571
to gain their trust.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.438
Columbus Avenue,
there are street vendors.

21:40.713 --> 21:42.078
Mrs. Kelly.

21:43.782 --> 21:44.874
Um...

21:45.184 --> 21:47.049
What's in that tube?

21:47.953 --> 21:50.945
A sketch of Marla.

21:51.023 --> 21:52.957
I found it on her desk.

21:54.660 --> 21:57.629
Two of the victims sent similar
sketches to their parents.

21:57.696 --> 21:59.664
Another one had hers
out to be framed.

21:59.732 --> 22:01.825
These portraits,
they take up to an half hour.

22:01.900 --> 22:04.733
That's plenty of time
to chat up the victims,

22:04.803 --> 22:06.430
find out if they're
single, live alone.

22:06.505 --> 22:07.870
And once he had
one on the hook, he what?

22:07.940 --> 22:09.635
Got in touch with Heltman,
set up a play date?

22:09.708 --> 22:12.006
Two days later,
the women disappeared.

22:12.478 --> 22:13.911
Latent and Forensics
have a look at these yet?

22:13.979 --> 22:17.312
Still looking, but they're
all done by the same guy.

22:17.383 --> 22:20.546
You can tell by the eyes, the
pie-shaped slices of light,

22:20.653 --> 22:23.679
same size and placement
in all the sketches.

22:24.089 --> 22:27.684
Well, then I know where to find
the two of you this weekend.

22:27.760 --> 22:30.752
Tomorrow night? I might
be able to fit you in.

22:31.764 --> 22:33.698
A photo exhibit? Sure.

22:35.334 --> 22:38.303
You're pulling my leg,
all the way to the roof?

22:38.370 --> 22:41.271
No. No, it sounds like
fun. I'll dress up.

22:42.174 --> 22:43.368
Bye.

22:44.443 --> 22:48.243
Guess what? You're eating
alone tomorrow night.

22:56.388 --> 22:59.016
Hi. Are you busy?

22:59.091 --> 23:01.491
No. Hey, have a seat.

23:06.231 --> 23:08.859
Hi, I'm Jerry.

23:10.135 --> 23:12.660
And because you're my first customer
after lunch, you get a discount.

23:12.738 --> 23:14.638
Really? That's the
first nice thing

23:14.707 --> 23:17.608
that's happened since
I've been in the city.

23:19.144 --> 23:20.805
So you're visiting?

23:20.879 --> 23:23.473
I just moved here
two weeks ago.

23:24.016 --> 23:26.416
Is this for a husband
or a boyfriend?

23:26.518 --> 23:30.545
No, no. No husband, no boyfriend.

23:31.724 --> 23:34.989
It's for my mom
back in Boston.

23:35.627 --> 23:38.027
So we make it nice
for Mom, then.

23:40.299 --> 23:42.529
Hey, I hope your friends
don't mind waiting.

23:42.601 --> 23:44.694
No one's waiting.

23:44.870 --> 23:47.464
I just went to the
movies by myself.

23:49.341 --> 23:54.074
So hard to meet people,
everybody's rushing around.

23:55.380 --> 23:56.506
What?

23:57.916 --> 24:00.544
Do I remind you of
somebody or something?

24:00.919 --> 24:02.614
Somebody nice.

24:08.427 --> 24:11.021
This portrait's off
to a great start.

24:11.697 --> 24:14.598
Hey, do you mind
if I hang on to this

24:14.666 --> 24:17.134
and take a photo
of it for my portfolio?

24:17.202 --> 24:21.639
I could, you know, send it to you
later or just drop it by, or...

24:24.409 --> 24:26.934
Hi. I really like
what you're doing.

24:28.380 --> 24:30.541
It's very nice.
It's your eyes.

24:30.616 --> 24:33.016
You know, it's like he has these,

24:33.685 --> 24:36.085
you know, like,
slices of light.

24:37.890 --> 24:38.879
Hey... Um...

24:38.957 --> 24:41.050
It's almost as pretty
as the real thing.

24:45.798 --> 24:47.026
I like that work
over there.

24:47.099 --> 24:49.659
It's like those detective
magazines, you know?

24:49.735 --> 24:52.898
The hand-drawn covers.

24:53.372 --> 24:57.035
There's an illustrator,
Rudolph Belarski.

24:57.409 --> 24:59.240
Yeah, I wouldn't know.

24:59.311 --> 25:03.873
He wouldn't know, but he's
actually having an exhibit

25:03.949 --> 25:06.042
at the museum
in Brooklyn.

25:06.385 --> 25:08.512
That sounds interesting.

25:08.587 --> 25:10.020
It's worth seeing.

25:11.623 --> 25:15.354
You know, actually, your stuff
reminds me of another artist.

25:16.128 --> 25:17.925
Margaret Brundage.

25:19.731 --> 25:21.756
I always found
it strange, because

25:21.834 --> 25:25.895
this woman would depict
other women as being

25:27.139 --> 25:29.835
weak and defenseless.

25:29.908 --> 25:35.346
That wasn't her style at all. Her
women were all vicious man-haters.

25:35.981 --> 25:40.884
She never captured them with the
delicacy of a Belarski or a de Soto.

25:42.087 --> 25:45.318
They portrayed the
female as she should be.

25:45.390 --> 25:47.051
You mean dead?

25:47.125 --> 25:50.185
Is that how you wanted
to portray me, Jerry?

25:54.066 --> 25:58.059
So what is this? My
license expire or something?

25:58.170 --> 25:59.228
We hope so.

25:59.304 --> 26:01.465
We're going to need
to see some ID.

26:02.641 --> 26:05.576
The license is issued
to a Jerry Summers.

26:05.677 --> 26:07.167
I've got a Spencer Farnell.

26:07.246 --> 26:09.908
And guess what?
You're both under arrest.

26:15.921 --> 26:18.719
Jerry Summers is a street
artist I knew from art school.

26:18.790 --> 26:20.257
He moved to
Santa Fe last year.

26:20.325 --> 26:22.486
He already paid for his
license, so he gave it to me.

26:22.561 --> 26:24.893
So now can he just get
arraigned and pay his fine?

26:24.963 --> 26:27.454
You know how slowly
things move on the weekend.

26:27.532 --> 26:30.057
We found these
in your wallet.

26:30.135 --> 26:33.229
The McNab Institute
of Mortuary Science.

26:33.305 --> 26:35.102
Sorry.

26:35.173 --> 26:38.438
Phipps College
of Criminal Studies,

26:38.510 --> 26:43.140
and a New York
Art Students Guild.

26:43.215 --> 26:48.175
I had such an array of interests,
I had a hard time finding myself.

26:48.387 --> 26:50.514
Have you found
yourself now?

26:50.689 --> 26:52.554
I suppose not.

26:53.158 --> 26:56.650
But, you know, I don't plan
on doing this work forever.

26:56.728 --> 26:59.162
You're going to play
to your other strength,

26:59.231 --> 27:01.290
picking up lonely women?

27:01.433 --> 27:03.663
A man has to
nourish his soul.

27:04.403 --> 27:08.032
What are these? Food?

27:09.708 --> 27:13.337
Your fellow artists on Columbus
Avenue said you were there

27:13.412 --> 27:16.074
the weekends before these
four girls disappeared.

27:16.148 --> 27:17.706
Well, that means
they were there, too.

27:17.783 --> 27:19.978
Any of them could have
drawn these sketches.

27:20.052 --> 27:22.179
How do you feel about
photography, Spencer?

27:22.254 --> 27:24.154
It's not my medium.

27:24.222 --> 27:28.283
Because we thought
that these showed promise.

27:32.998 --> 27:37.162
But to be fair, I mean, you did
have help from Gerhardt Heltman.

27:40.372 --> 27:42.101
Find them exciting?

27:42.207 --> 27:46.473
Or maybe Gerhardt
never let you see them.

27:48.814 --> 27:50.645
This is the first time.

27:51.316 --> 27:52.715
What?

27:53.452 --> 27:55.716
Of course it's the first time.

27:56.021 --> 27:58.717
I had nothing to do
with these photos.

27:58.924 --> 28:01.119
I never met Gerhardt Heltman.

28:06.732 --> 28:08.927
Spencer
did his homework.

28:09.001 --> 28:11.526
He highlighted where Gerhardt
wrote about his parents

28:11.603 --> 28:15.562
in the concentration camps
being the ultimate victims.

28:15.640 --> 28:19.167
That and a murder confession
might get us an indictment.

28:19.711 --> 28:21.645
Here's his inspiration.

28:26.918 --> 28:31.116
They're well-thumbed, and he might have
gotten them from the original owner.

28:31.189 --> 28:34.784
I hope this isn't his wish
list for future victims.

28:35.594 --> 28:38.392
He's got them
arranged in groups.

28:38.463 --> 28:40.658
Three blondes
with long hair,

28:40.966 --> 28:44.424
two with short hair,
four brunettes

28:44.736 --> 28:47.227
and three
gray-haired ladies.

28:47.806 --> 28:49.797
He picked
specific types,

28:50.108 --> 28:53.043
maybe corresponding
to people that he knows.

28:54.946 --> 28:57.107
Spencer and his father?

28:58.150 --> 29:00.983
He might be the
magazines' original owner.

29:08.960 --> 29:10.621
Broken marbles.

29:14.099 --> 29:18.536
Spencer told his artist buddies that
he worked part-time for a mortician.

29:20.672 --> 29:22.640
Maybe he told Heltman
he could supply him

29:22.707 --> 29:25.699
with bodies from
a mortuary to photograph.

29:27.112 --> 29:30.172
Even if Heltman didn't know
the girls were being murdered,

29:30.248 --> 29:33.183
why would he want to take pictures
of bodies in the first place?

29:33.251 --> 29:34.513
You know,
his wife said that

29:34.586 --> 29:38.386
he was intolerant of people who
let themselves be victimized.

29:40.459 --> 29:42.723
This project might
have been a way of,

29:43.829 --> 29:46.263
you know,
re-sensitizing himself.

29:47.632 --> 29:49.998
Reconnecting to his parents.

29:52.671 --> 29:55.504
I need the lab to
reprint these negatives.

29:56.007 --> 29:58.840
I got Spencer's file
from Family Services.

29:59.411 --> 30:02.380
He and his three sisters were
in and out of foster homes.

30:02.447 --> 30:05.974
Parents were alcoholics,
left the kids on their own.

30:06.051 --> 30:08.042
Three sisters,
older than Spencer?

30:08.120 --> 30:10.554
One of them, present
whereabouts are unknown,

30:10.622 --> 30:13.853
one's got multiple drug beefs,
currently living in Seattle,

30:13.925 --> 30:17.986
and the third one's in Bedford
Hills, 6- to-18 for manslaughter.

30:18.096 --> 30:19.620
What happened to his father?

30:19.698 --> 30:22.929
Mother died four years
ago, liver disease.

30:23.468 --> 30:27.029
Father was in a drunk-driving
accident almost 20 years ago.

30:27.105 --> 30:29.801
We need to see
the rest of his family.

30:32.944 --> 30:35.936
Spence was a good kid. Girls
used to give him a hard time.

30:36.014 --> 30:39.381
We'd dog-pile on top of him.
His face would turn red.

30:39.651 --> 30:41.209
It was funny.

30:42.020 --> 30:44.784
Ma said he was a boy,
he could take it.

30:44.856 --> 30:46.881
You like your brother,
we can tell.

30:46.958 --> 30:50.485
Yeah, he wasn't like us.
He could hold a straight job,

30:51.730 --> 30:53.925
talk to strangers
without getting in a fight.

30:53.999 --> 30:56.934
You think that's
your dad's influence?

30:57.002 --> 30:58.526
They were close, right?

30:58.603 --> 31:01.595
Spence was like him.
You know, sensitive.

31:01.973 --> 31:03.838
He was
good to Spence.

31:04.209 --> 31:08.270
Bought him toys,
like marbles...

31:11.950 --> 31:13.713
Yeah, like marbles.

31:14.452 --> 31:18.252
You're smiling. Did you do
something to his marbles?

31:18.857 --> 31:22.258
When Dad died, Spence wouldn't
stop crying like a baby,

31:22.327 --> 31:24.955
so we got a hammer
and we smashed his marbles.

31:25.030 --> 31:26.292
Shut him up.

31:26.364 --> 31:29.231
We noticed some medical
records in his file.

31:29.301 --> 31:32.828
When he was nine, he went
to the emergency room.

31:32.904 --> 31:35.065
Somebody set
his hair on fire.

31:35.140 --> 31:38.667
Oh, yeah, that was Sandy.
She threw matches at him.

31:38.743 --> 31:41.541
And then he spent a week in the
hospital with food poisoning?

31:41.613 --> 31:43.103
Oh, yeah, Patty.

31:43.181 --> 31:45.581
Fried up bad meat
and made him eat it.

31:45.650 --> 31:48.050
Another time he was brought in
with burns all over his body.

31:48.119 --> 31:51.987
Grandma. She threw him in the
shower and turned on the hot water.

31:52.057 --> 31:56.460
Oh, yeah? Doris, what
did you do to Spencer?

31:57.562 --> 31:59.860
I used to play Bad Nurse.

32:02.500 --> 32:07.528
Tie him down on Grandma's smelly
bed, put on my ma's nurse hat,

32:07.872 --> 32:10.500
and then I'd beat
the crap out of him.

32:10.942 --> 32:13.274
But, you know, like Ma
said, he could take it.

32:14.446 --> 32:16.573
Hey, look, I got
to get back to work.

32:16.648 --> 32:18.741
You see him, you tell
him hi for me, okay?

32:18.817 --> 32:21.115
We will. Thanks, Doris.

32:24.356 --> 32:27.154
Four photos. Five women.

32:28.627 --> 32:29.889
Fire.

32:31.229 --> 32:32.526
Poison.

32:32.731 --> 32:34.562
Scalding hot water.

32:34.966 --> 32:36.263
And Mom.

32:37.502 --> 32:39.732
The only one
missing is Doris.

32:40.905 --> 32:45.933
The sketches in his apartment,
one of them looked like her.

32:50.215 --> 32:52.115
His next victim?

32:52.183 --> 32:53.241
If he has her sketch,

32:53.318 --> 32:56.685
then he has a way to get in
touch with her to return it.

32:57.622 --> 32:59.055
He did this
last weekend.

32:59.124 --> 33:01.718
Is he all right? We were
supposed to go out last night,

33:01.793 --> 33:02.782
but he never
showed up.

33:02.861 --> 33:04.658
He got very busy.

33:04.996 --> 33:06.520
Where was he
taking you, Maisie?

33:06.598 --> 33:09.362
An art gallery,
to see some photos.

33:09.801 --> 33:11.359
He say anything about
this art gallery?

33:11.436 --> 33:12.425
Where it was...

33:12.504 --> 33:14.734
Somewhere in the city,
this big building.

33:14.806 --> 33:18.105
He said you could drive
all the way up to the roof.

33:18.310 --> 33:22.906
All right. Thank you, Maisie. The
officer will show you back downstairs.

33:22.981 --> 33:26.212
I thought it'd be fun
to know somebody with a car.

33:30.255 --> 33:32.382
Lab sent these back.
Anything from the girl?
