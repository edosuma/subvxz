Gossip Girl here,
your one and only source

00:04.004 --> 00:05.570
into the scandalous life
of Manhattan's elite.

00:05.657 --> 00:07.355
This is my boyfriend,
Dan Humphrey.

00:07.442 --> 00:09.748
Dan, this is Miss Carr,
she's my favorite new teacher.

00:09.835 --> 00:11.011
What are you doin' here?

00:11.098 --> 00:12.316
I'm taking your advice

00:12.403 --> 00:13.404
to come out
to Brooklyn sometime.

00:13.491 --> 00:14.579
Why would she turn down Yale?

00:14.666 --> 00:16.059
Why-why would you do that?

00:16.146 --> 00:17.800
Brown is a just
a better fit for me, Dan.

00:17.887 --> 00:19.454
Do we still fit?

00:19.541 --> 00:22.413
This is a "b". A second semester
seniors get a free pass.

00:22.500 --> 00:24.372
You wanna get Rachel back
for the grade she gave you?

00:24.459 --> 00:25.895
I can't risk
not getting into Yale.

00:25.982 --> 00:27.897
I just wanted
to teach you a lesson.

00:27.984 --> 00:29.899
Inviting me to a
closed restaurant for dinner?

00:29.986 --> 00:31.901
Miss Carr told me what you did.

00:31.988 --> 00:35.339
If you complete detention
to mysatisfaction

00:35.426 --> 00:37.167
'Yale will still be possible.'

00:37.254 --> 00:38.995
- Is it war?
- Yes.

00:39.082 --> 00:40.605
But this one
will be different.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.347
[theme music]

00:43.434 --> 00:44.783
And who am I?

00:44.870 --> 00:46.655
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

00:48.004 --> 00:50.180
You know you love me.

00:50.267 --> 00:51.834
XOXO.

00:51.921 --> 00:53.009

00:55.577 --> 00:58.406
While Upper East siders
are hitting the snooze button

00:58.493 --> 01:00.625
Blair Waldorf,
had a rude awakening

01:00.712 --> 01:03.019
when the rooster
crowed at dawn this morning.

01:03.106 --> 01:04.151
Never.

01:04.238 --> 01:07.676
In my 16,982 hours of schooling

01:07.763 --> 01:09.982
have I ever been sentenced
to detention.

01:10.070 --> 01:12.898
I can't believe you added up all
the hours of class we've had.

01:12.985 --> 01:14.552

to do with that.'

Ring a bell?

01:28.784 --> 01:30.655
'Look, all I know is'

01:30.742 --> 01:32.831
I've never had a teacher who's
actually taken me seriously.

01:32.918 --> 01:36.139
It feels like she really
gets me. Is-is that weird?

01:36.226 --> 01:38.098
Looks like Humphrey
has some competition.

01:38.185 --> 01:40.187
Well, Dan and I
have barely spoken all week.

01:40.274 --> 01:42.754
They say conversation
is the first thing to go.

01:42.841 --> 01:45.192
We will talk. There's just
a lot of going on right now.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.628
'Look, B, I gotta go.'

01:46.715 --> 01:48.369
I know where
Rachel eats breakfast

01:48.456 --> 01:50.284
and I have to drop off
my extra credit essay

01:50.371 --> 01:52.199
before I go to school.
I'll see you there.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.986
Serena's sympathetic
to the enemy.

01:57.073 --> 01:58.944
I have to cross her off
my list of recruits.

02:01.469 --> 02:03.993
Give me that, quick!
Come on! Quick!

02:05.995 --> 02:07.301
Yeah? Daddy!

02:07.388 --> 02:09.041
What a nice surprise!

02:09.129 --> 02:11.000
Handsome and I thought
we'd bring you some breakfast.

02:12.436 --> 02:15.352
Thank you.

02:15.439 --> 02:18.573
Ahh. You know Blair Bear,
I'm proud of you.

02:18.660 --> 02:20.836
You're handling your punishment
with such grace.

02:20.923 --> 02:24.274
Well, we Waldorfs' are nothing
if not graceful.

02:24.361 --> 02:26.102
I wish you'd let me
speak to the school.

02:26.189 --> 02:28.539
It sounds like this teacher's
been after you from the start.

02:28.626 --> 02:31.629
Thank you. But I wanted to
handle this on my own.

02:31.716 --> 02:32.935
That speaks volumes

02:33.022 --> 02:35.677
of the mature young lady
you've become.

02:35.764 --> 02:38.375
I wish everyone could
see me through your eyes.

02:40.464 --> 02:41.770
You keep your chin up.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.905
I'll see you after school.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.432
Bye-bye.

02:51.519 --> 02:54.043
Miss Blair,
your martyr act..

02:54.130 --> 02:55.523
...no good.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.396
Pick up the pace,
shall we?

03:03.487 --> 03:05.533
I have to say Dan,
I like this story

03:05.620 --> 03:06.925
even more than
the last one you showed me.

03:07.012 --> 03:10.538
I can totally relate
to the sense of isolation..

03:10.625 --> 03:12.192
Feeling like an outsider..

03:12.279 --> 03:14.542
An outsider? You?

03:14.629 --> 03:16.631
Well, you know what?
It took me ten years to master

03:16.718 --> 03:18.546
the local-express-
local-switchback.

03:18.633 --> 03:21.288
And this morning? Gotta say you
rode the subway like a native.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.768
Do any other
Constance St. Jude's students

03:23.855 --> 03:25.117
ever take the subway?

03:25.205 --> 03:27.381
Uh, no. Most of them
have limos with drivers.

03:27.468 --> 03:29.774
And overbearing parents,
overbooked schedules..

03:29.861 --> 03:31.167
And overflowing bank accounts.

03:31.254 --> 03:33.822
And a distracting sense
of self-absorption.

03:33.909 --> 03:35.519
School is the last thing
on their minds

03:35.606 --> 03:37.129
which is why
I've been talking

03:37.217 --> 03:39.001
to headmistress Queller
about some ideas I have

03:39.088 --> 03:40.698
to get the students
more focused on learning.

03:40.785 --> 03:42.526
[Dan]
'Oh, really?
What do you have planned?'

03:44.441 --> 03:46.095

03:46.182 --> 03:47.836
Hi, Serena.

03:47.923 --> 03:50.447
You guys are...hanging out?

03:50.534 --> 03:52.232
Yeah, well, Rachel has been
givin' me, uh..

03:52.319 --> 03:54.190
some feedback on my stories.

03:54.277 --> 03:56.323

And by "feedback",
he means "a wall of praise."

03:56.410 --> 03:59.108
- Dan is a really good writer.
- Trust me, I know.

03:59.195 --> 04:01.719

Cordelia reference

04:16.212 --> 04:17.518
in one of his stories.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.956
Oh, um, I was wondering

04:21.043 --> 04:23.088
can I have
a little bit more time?

'Uh, no.
Why? What's up?'

05:15.532 --> 05:18.753
I'm not sure.
But I think last night

05:18.840 --> 05:20.450
may have been the greatest
night of my life.

05:20.537 --> 05:22.539
- 'Really?'

05:37.598 --> 05:40.296
I hope the experience
was educational.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.124
I made friends
with a family of squirrels

05:42.211 --> 05:43.952

11:19.809 --> 11:21.115
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

11:21.202 --> 11:22.682
It's just a file folder.
It's not a brick wall.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.596
I meant before that.
You didn't even notice me

11:24.684 --> 11:25.641
until you
nearly knocked me over.

11:25.728 --> 11:27.338
No, no, no.
No, I-I noticed you.

11:27.425 --> 11:29.950
I was just actually thinking
how much I like your sweater.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.562
Thanks.

11:33.649 --> 11:35.477
Not that I didn't like what
you were wearing yesterday

11:35.564 --> 11:38.306
or that I even remember...well
it was a yellow sweater

11:38.393 --> 11:40.264
and, uh,
those shoe/boot things.

11:40.351 --> 11:41.657
- Dan?
- Yeah.

11:41.744 --> 11:43.964
Breathe.

11:44.051 --> 11:45.835
Right.

11:45.922 --> 11:48.229
'Oxygen it's good
for the brain.'

11:48.316 --> 11:51.928
Ladies, you can give
your tiny brains a rest.

11:52.015 --> 11:54.888
Once again, the world
has proven anything you can do

11:54.975 --> 11:56.541
I can do better.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.284
I'm sorry about that.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.503
I'm sure you're
on your way to class or--

12:01.590 --> 12:03.157
[Rachel]
'No, I'm just..'

12:03.244 --> 12:06.116
- Ms. Carr and Dan Humphrey?
- Are they really?

12:06.203 --> 12:09.250
Who cares? But I have
a friend in cyberspace

12:09.337 --> 12:10.947
who'll know just what to do.

12:14.472 --> 12:16.387
[beeping]

12:20.957 --> 12:21.958
[beep]

12:22.045 --> 12:23.438
XOXO.

12:29.531 --> 12:31.185
Oh, good job, man.

12:31.272 --> 12:33.056
Way to go.

12:33.143 --> 12:35.189
- What?
- Yeah, dude.

12:41.456 --> 12:42.805
[clears throat]

12:42.892 --> 12:46.678
Hey, this day is
getting weirder by the minute.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.376
Anything you
want to tell me?

12:48.463 --> 12:50.465
Uh, besides I'm glad

12:50.552 --> 12:52.380
you're not wearing
that raccoon makeup anymore?

12:52.467 --> 12:53.947
'cause you looked like
one of "The Incredibles."

12:54.034 --> 12:55.644
Oh, thanks a lot.

12:55.731 --> 12:58.516
And I thought Iwas
the bad seed in the family.

12:59.822 --> 13:01.911
What? What? Alright,
what's going on?

13:04.696 --> 13:08.048
"Is-is lonely boy giving
a certain new teacher

13:08.135 --> 13:10.485
more than just an apple?"
What does that mean?

13:10.572 --> 13:12.139
And-and why is it written
on your hand?

13:12.226 --> 13:13.749
'Cause Nelly Yuki wouldn't

13:13.836 --> 13:15.316
give me her contraband
phone to show you myself.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.144
I mean, this
is just the headline.

13:17.231 --> 13:19.059
And the whole post would've
gone all the way up my arm.

13:19.146 --> 13:21.191
It was quite detailed
about you and Ms. Carr

13:21.278 --> 13:22.889
and your forbidden love.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.021
- M-me and Ms. Carr?
- Mm-hmm.

13:25.108 --> 13:28.895
What? No. That's absurd.
That is absurd.

13:28.982 --> 13:31.158
Well, I'm not the one
you need to convince.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.769
I will see you later.

13:33.856 --> 13:36.424
- Dan, tell me this is not true.
- Do you really need to ask?

13:36.511 --> 13:38.513
If there's something you
need to say, then say it now.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.123
No, there's not.
There's not, I swear.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.864
I have no idea who
sent that text or why.

13:44.084 --> 13:46.260
Okay.

13:46.347 --> 13:48.218
I'm sorry I doubted you.

13:48.305 --> 13:50.699
Just...things were so
weird between us this morning

13:50.786 --> 13:52.744
and then this..
I-I don't know.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.007
I-I guess
I was just confused.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.617
Yeah, I'm right
there with you.

13:57.532 --> 13:58.925
Who-why would someone
want to do this?

13:59.012 --> 14:02.493
I mean, I thought
everyone loved Rachel.

14:02.580 --> 14:07.672
Well, I do know someone who's
not exactly her biggest fan.

14:07.759 --> 14:10.066
Blair got trash duty
in Central Park because of her.

14:10.153 --> 14:12.242
If Blair did
this to Rachel, this..

14:12.329 --> 14:14.636
I mean, she's
gone way too far.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.945
[piano music]

14:26.300 --> 14:28.693
So the ultimate
gentlemen's club was here?

14:28.780 --> 14:30.826
Because this place
reminds me of my aunt's house.

14:30.913 --> 14:34.003
This was the place.
I know it.

14:34.090 --> 14:37.615
There were velvet curtains
blocking this hallway.

14:42.272 --> 14:45.972
There were women
wearing masks

14:46.059 --> 14:48.148
lying on a divan
right where this piano is.

14:48.235 --> 14:50.367
Alright, listen, maybe
you should get some rest.

14:50.454 --> 14:51.586
[Nate]
'It could help
jog your memory.'

14:51.673 --> 14:53.327
Or warm ginger ale.

14:53.414 --> 14:54.763
It's a miracle hangover cure.

14:54.850 --> 14:57.026
This is her.
This is the woman.

14:58.288 --> 14:59.246
Let me see.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.465
[scoffs]

15:01.552 --> 15:03.554
[Vanessa]
'No way. The mom?'

15:03.641 --> 15:05.295
This must be her house.

15:05.382 --> 15:08.168
Well, there's
only one way to find out.

15:25.402 --> 15:27.100
The ladies room?

15:27.187 --> 15:29.580
I knew you and Serena
were having problems.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.408
I had no clue
they were anatomical.

15:31.495 --> 15:33.758
The only reason
I'm trespassing on sacred ground

15:33.845 --> 15:36.283
is 'cause I know you sent
that rumor to "Gossip Girl."

15:36.370 --> 15:40.026
Sorry. No idea what you're
talking about. You can go now.

15:40.113 --> 15:41.679
Look, whatever issues
you have with Rachel..

15:41.766 --> 15:44.291
She cares about people.
She cares about her job.

15:44.378 --> 15:47.729
Oh...that is so sweet.

15:47.816 --> 15:49.905
[Blair]
'Maybe you should write
a short story about it'

15:49.992 --> 15:52.603
and have Rachel
give you notes...naked.

16:00.133 --> 16:01.308
[giggles]

16:01.395 --> 16:03.614
I'm just..
alright, okay. Alright.

16:05.312 --> 16:06.704
Hey.

16:06.791 --> 16:08.968
I'm-I'm sorry I didn't
give this to you earlier.

16:09.055 --> 16:13.102
I know it's silly,
but the reason is, um..

16:13.189 --> 16:15.148
Well, Dan..

16:15.235 --> 16:17.454
..he's so confident
in his writing that I..

16:17.541 --> 16:19.717
I don't know. I was just
a little intimidated.

16:19.804 --> 16:22.894
Dan's talented,
but his confidence comes

16:22.982 --> 16:25.810
from a lifetime
of encouragement and praise.

16:25.897 --> 16:28.726
I'm guessing, for you,
birthdays rarely meant new pens

16:28.813 --> 16:30.554
and a notebook
to fill with your ideas.

16:30.641 --> 16:33.035
Yeah, more like a Chanel wallet
and a credit card

16:33.122 --> 16:35.255
to get me out of the house.

16:35.342 --> 16:36.560
Thank you.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.869
Oh, my God,
that's Miss Carr.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.219
It's like I have spinach
in my teeth or something.

16:43.306 --> 16:44.699
And I don't. I even went
to the bathroom to check.

16:44.786 --> 16:47.615
Mm-hmm, yeah,
it's actually not spinach.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.530
Um, it's a rumor.

16:49.617 --> 16:51.793
A pretty ugly one
about you and Dan.

16:51.880 --> 16:56.145
- But I-I know it's not true.
- A rumor about me and Dan.

16:56.232 --> 16:57.886
I've been at this school long
enough to know what that means.

16:57.973 --> 17:00.236
- Unbelievable.
- Yeah, well, don't worry.

17:00.323 --> 17:02.021
I've been on
"Gossip girl" plenty of times

17:02.108 --> 17:03.631
and for the worst things.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.720
Some of them were true,
some of them weren't.

17:05.807 --> 17:07.722
But eventually,
everyone forgets.

17:07.809 --> 17:09.158
The best thing
to do with these things

17:09.245 --> 17:11.421
is just nothing at all.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.119
"Gossip Girl?"

17:13.206 --> 17:15.512
Oh, yeah, it's,
um, it's a web site

17:15.599 --> 17:18.080
where a girl posts gossip.

17:18.167 --> 17:19.690
Well, at least
we think it's a girl.

17:19.777 --> 17:22.606
And where does
she get her tips?

17:22.693 --> 17:25.305
Um, it's anonymous,
so no one really knows.

17:25.392 --> 17:27.263
But I gotta get to class.

17:28.960 --> 17:30.614
[sighs]
Hey, Rachel.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.790
You got a minute?

17:32.877 --> 17:35.097
Yeah.

17:35.184 --> 17:37.621
[Chuck]
'It is a great
piece of property.'

17:37.708 --> 17:40.059
I'm surprised anyone
would want to sell.

17:40.146 --> 17:42.713
The husband finally caved,
agreed to a Greenwich commute.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.672
- Husband.
- Mm-hmm.

17:44.759 --> 17:46.891
The woman with the baby
in the picture..

17:46.978 --> 17:49.329
- I just assumed.
- The nanny.

17:49.416 --> 17:51.461
I thought prospective buyers
would like that photo.

17:51.548 --> 17:54.247
The nanny. Of course.

17:54.334 --> 17:56.553
Look, there's
some, uh, questions

17:56.640 --> 17:58.381
I'd like to ask
the owners.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.035
Nothing serious.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.777
Noise, neighbors,
that sort of thing.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.431
I'll do my best
to answer them

18:04.518 --> 18:07.608
but I can't give out
a client's personal information.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.131
It's policy.

18:09.218 --> 18:11.655
Of course. I understand.

18:11.742 --> 18:13.614
But I'm sure you know
what the Bass name means

18:13.701 --> 18:15.311
in real estate.

18:15.398 --> 18:18.053
If you were to help me,
maybe you'd allow me

18:18.140 --> 18:19.402
to extend the same professional

18:19.489 --> 18:22.101
courtesy to you in the future?

18:22.188 --> 18:24.190
Well, I could never do
anything unprofessional.

18:25.974 --> 18:27.889
But sometimes I do
leave a file unattended

18:27.976 --> 18:30.370
when I go to get a drink.

18:30.457 --> 18:32.546
There's some bottled
water in the fridge.

18:32.633 --> 18:33.547
Are you thirsty?

18:33.634 --> 18:35.723
Parched.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.079
[cell phone dial clicking]

18:46.473 --> 18:47.735
[male #1]
'Hello?'

18:47.822 --> 18:49.345
Yes, is this
the Philips residence?

18:49.432 --> 18:50.651
[Philips]
'Yes.'

18:50.738 --> 18:52.522
I hope I'm
not disturbing you.

18:52.609 --> 18:54.742
I was wondering if I could
speak with your nanny, please.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.961
'I'm sorry. Elle's with
the children at the park.'

18:57.048 --> 18:58.485
'Can I take a message?'

18:58.572 --> 19:00.051
Elle.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.662
We met last night in Manhattan.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.925
I just wanted to thank her
for a lovely evening.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.319
'That's impossible, Elle was
here in Greenwich last night'

19:06.406 --> 19:07.842
'watching the children.'

19:07.929 --> 19:09.800
- You sure?
- 'Absolutely.'

19:12.847 --> 19:15.589
Could I leave
a message, please?

19:15.676 --> 19:16.981
Can you tell her
Chuck Bass called?

19:17.068 --> 19:19.680
My number is 646..

19:19.767 --> 19:22.813
I was told you wanted
to see me, headmistress Queller?

19:22.900 --> 19:25.512
Miss Waldorf,
please have a seat.

19:30.821 --> 19:33.694
This school has been aware
of the "Gossip Girl"

19:33.781 --> 19:35.957
web site for some time.

19:36.044 --> 19:38.655
Up until now, the content
has focused on the students.

19:38.742 --> 19:41.789
The students haven't complained,
so we've turned a blind eye.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.399
However, now that a teacher

19:43.486 --> 19:45.096
'has become involved'

19:45.184 --> 19:48.012
I have no choice
but to deal with it.

19:48.099 --> 19:50.885
I'm sorry. I have no idea
what you're talking about.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.365
Blair.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.149
I know you posted
the rumor about me.

19:55.455 --> 19:57.500
Whatever rumor
you're talking about

19:57.587 --> 19:58.936
I had nothing
to do with it.

19:59.023 --> 20:02.288
I...find this accusation
preposterous.

20:04.942 --> 20:08.032
Miss Temmel, would you please
send the student in? Thank you.

20:08.119 --> 20:11.035
Someone came forward and
identified you as the source.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.646
Let me guess,
Dan Humphrey?

20:12.733 --> 20:15.126
This information was
then confirmed by a witness.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.128
[door opens]

20:20.958 --> 20:23.874
If I don't go ivy league,
my dad will kill me.

20:23.961 --> 20:25.876
[Nelly]
'It was my record or yours.'

20:25.963 --> 20:27.356
We tried to tell you
something like this would happen

20:27.443 --> 20:29.010
but you just wouldn't listen.

20:29.097 --> 20:30.490
I'm sorry, Blair.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.883
Blair, your actions
threatened the reputation

20:32.970 --> 20:35.625
of the entire teaching
staff and this school.

20:35.712 --> 20:37.018
You give me no choice
but to ask you

20:37.105 --> 20:38.672
to leave Constance Billard.

20:39.934 --> 20:41.065
You're expelling me?

20:52.425 --> 20:56.298
[sighs]
Headmistress Queller is
standing firm on the expulsion.

20:56.385 --> 20:58.561
Yale will revoke
my acceptance

20:58.648 --> 21:00.128
as soon as
they receive word.

21:02.652 --> 21:04.219
This is my darkest hour.

21:04.306 --> 21:06.830
Blair, if you started
that rumor

21:06.917 --> 21:08.179
about Dan Humphrey
and the teacher

21:08.267 --> 21:10.356
she has a legitimate
case for slander.

21:12.880 --> 21:14.664
I need to know.

21:14.751 --> 21:16.840
Did you?

21:16.927 --> 21:19.887
I might've posted something
on "Gossip Girl."

21:19.974 --> 21:22.237
all the girls do it.

21:22.324 --> 21:23.804
It's how we communicate.

21:25.327 --> 21:27.938
But anything I
wrote was the truth.

21:30.201 --> 21:31.899
I didn't lie.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.857
I promise, daddy.

21:33.944 --> 21:35.903
[sighs]

21:35.990 --> 21:38.209
You should've been honest with
the headmistress about that.

21:40.386 --> 21:43.171
But the real issue here is not
teenagers gossiping online.

21:44.738 --> 21:45.782
It's not?

21:45.869 --> 21:47.610
No, it's that
a teacher is having

21:47.697 --> 21:50.265
an inappropriate
relationship with a student.

21:50.352 --> 21:52.267
I'm gonna contact my lawyers.

21:52.354 --> 21:53.877
We're gonna fight this.

21:53.964 --> 21:55.531
Fight it? Oh, I don't--

21:55.618 --> 21:57.620
You will not be punished
for telling the truth.

22:02.103 --> 22:04.148
Thank you, daddy.

22:04.235 --> 22:06.847
So you ratted on Blair?
You Templeton.

22:06.934 --> 22:08.762
A charlotte's web-sult?
That's very cute.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.154
And, no, technically,
I did not rat on Blair.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.373
I just told Rachel
to put the squeeze

22:11.460 --> 22:13.723
on the weakest
of her kilted cronies.

22:13.810 --> 22:14.855
And what does
Serena think of you getting

22:14.942 --> 22:16.944
her best friend expelled?

22:17.031 --> 22:18.989
The moment Blair involves me
in her schemes

22:19.076 --> 22:20.339
the "Boyfriend of the BFF."
clause

22:20.426 --> 22:21.383
is officially null and void.

22:21.470 --> 22:22.645
So she brought it on herself.

22:22.732 --> 22:25.213
The alleged
online slander incident?

22:25.300 --> 22:28.085
What? You, um..
You heard about the rumor?

22:28.172 --> 22:29.348
You gave it a name?

22:29.435 --> 22:30.436
Well, the parents'
council called an

22:30.523 --> 22:31.872
emergency meeting tonight.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.352
Apparently, my son
is the object of the slander

22:33.439 --> 22:35.919
assuming that it is slander.

22:36.006 --> 22:36.964
You and Ms. Carr.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.661
[knock on door]

22:38.748 --> 22:40.576
A package for Vanessa Abrams.

22:40.663 --> 22:42.273
Saved by the bell.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.145
[sighs]
Dan, if I'm
gonna walk into a room

22:44.232 --> 22:46.016
full of fired-up parents,
I need to know.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.714
Is there something
we need to talk about?

22:51.674 --> 22:54.111
I'm gonna go file this.

22:54.198 --> 22:55.722
No, there's-no,
there's nothing to talk about.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.767
My tea is getting cold.

23:01.467 --> 23:04.165
Hey, thanks for meeting me.
I brought these to keep us warm.

23:04.252 --> 23:05.775
Oh, thanks.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.864
After everything
that's gone on this week

23:07.951 --> 23:09.605
I feel safer
meeting outside.

23:09.692 --> 23:10.867
We can talk freely.

23:10.954 --> 23:13.261
I swept
the perimeter for bugs.

23:13.348 --> 23:17.047
[sighs]
Ms. Carr, I-I understand
that you're upset with Blair.

23:17.134 --> 23:19.310
What she did was wrong.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.138
But does her punishment
have to be expulsion?

23:21.225 --> 23:22.705
It means she'll lose Yale.

23:22.792 --> 23:25.142
Do you think this
is a step I wanted to take?

23:25.229 --> 23:26.579
I feel terrible

23:26.666 --> 23:28.842
but Blair posted a rumor
that threatened

23:28.929 --> 23:30.844
to destroy
my career, my future.

23:30.931 --> 23:33.629
And getting expelled
destroys Blair's future.

23:33.716 --> 23:35.762
Please just talk
to Headmistress Queller

23:35.849 --> 23:37.154
and ask her to reconsider.

23:37.241 --> 23:39.243
"Gossip Girl"
is just a stupid web site.

23:39.330 --> 23:41.681
How can you say that,
when its sole purpose is

23:41.768 --> 23:44.335
to allow people to post terrible
things about each other?

23:44.423 --> 23:47.382
I'm not defending "Gossip Girl."
I'm defending my best friend.

23:47.469 --> 23:50.472
[sighs]
Believe me, Serena,
I'm sorry this all happened.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.998
But I have to go.

23:55.085 --> 23:57.479
I have an appointment
before the parents' meeting.

23:57.566 --> 23:59.525
I do hope
we can still be friends.

24:12.668 --> 24:14.583
[ringing]

24:14.670 --> 24:17.194
- 'Hello?'
- Hey.

24:17.281 --> 24:20.937
Hey, I-I-I really thought that
Rachel would come around, but..

24:21.024 --> 24:22.199
[Serena]
'I'm sorry, B'.

24:22.286 --> 24:23.897
Dorota.

24:23.984 --> 24:26.943
'Blair? Blair?'

24:27.030 --> 24:30.338
Give Handsome
to a homeless man.

24:30.425 --> 24:32.383
Make sure
he has kind eyes.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.995
I'm not going to Yale.

24:35.082 --> 24:36.866
I don't deserve you.

24:37.911 --> 24:38.912
[sighs]

24:38.999 --> 24:40.609
'Okay, I'm back.'

24:40.696 --> 24:42.742
Just hang in there, okay?

24:42.829 --> 24:44.657
'We'll figure something out.'

24:44.744 --> 24:47.616
[instrumental music]

25:02.326 --> 25:04.764
I can't believe we're all
here on a Saturday night.

25:04.851 --> 25:07.331
That's a lot of canceled
restaurant reservations.

25:07.418 --> 25:08.898
Well, you expel
one Yale-bound senior

25:08.985 --> 25:10.160
it gets people's attention.

25:10.247 --> 25:13.163
- Harold, how are you?
- Lily.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.339
I'm hoping that I can count
on your support tonight.

25:15.426 --> 25:16.906
Blair is being
horribly scapegoated.

25:16.993 --> 25:18.604
I thought the
meeting was to discuss

25:18.691 --> 25:20.344
the school's
new online honor codes.

25:20.431 --> 25:22.825
Yes, well, I'm crashing it
to advocate for my daughter.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.653
Harold Waldorf.

25:24.740 --> 25:26.525
Well, I'm here to make
sure no other students are

25:26.612 --> 25:29.658
slandered the way my son was by
your daughter. Rufus Humphrey.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.442
Okay, we'll see you
inside, Harold.

25:34.968 --> 25:36.709
- 'Nathaniel.'
- Hey, what's going on?

25:36.796 --> 25:38.624
Now you're not still thinking
about that girl, are you?

25:38.711 --> 25:40.800
Her name is Elle.

25:40.887 --> 25:42.062
And if you must know.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.325
I'm late for my chiropractor.

25:44.412 --> 25:45.979
'She's double-jointed.'

25:46.066 --> 25:48.808
Makes the "Kama Sutra"
feel new again.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.244
Nice to see
you're moving on.

25:50.331 --> 25:52.507
'Call me tomorrow, alright?'

25:52.594 --> 25:54.857
[beep]

25:54.944 --> 25:56.032
[instrumental music]

26:05.564 --> 26:08.784
I just wanted
to thank you for yesterday.

26:08.871 --> 26:10.438
I don't have
any friends in the city

26:10.525 --> 26:11.961
and telling me about Blair

26:12.048 --> 26:13.528
you really acted like one.

26:13.615 --> 26:16.009
Oh, anytime and,
you know, if you ever need

26:16.096 --> 26:19.578
a-a character witness to
vouch for how fantastic you are

26:19.665 --> 26:22.058
uh, I'm your guy.

26:22.145 --> 26:23.756
That's sweet. Thank you.

26:26.236 --> 26:28.891
A character witness.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.763
Do you know
it may have come to that?

26:30.850 --> 26:32.591
I'm sorry. I didn't-I didn't
mean to upset you.

26:32.678 --> 26:35.202
No, I'm sorry, I'm..

26:35.289 --> 26:37.160
...overwhelmed.

26:37.247 --> 26:40.686
And this rumor
is just...so insulting.

26:40.773 --> 26:42.296
An affair with a student?
Me and you?

26:42.383 --> 26:44.559
I would n-never do that.

26:44.646 --> 26:47.867
Never? W-wow,
that's...definitive.

26:47.954 --> 26:50.478
Please, don't...
take it personally.

26:50.565 --> 26:51.784
- I mean..
- No, no.

26:51.871 --> 26:53.873
If you were older or..

26:53.960 --> 26:57.311
...not a student
at the brother school.

26:57.398 --> 26:59.618
You can call me
in five years.

27:05.928 --> 27:07.060
Here.

27:07.147 --> 27:08.670
Here.

27:15.068 --> 27:17.940
[instrumental music]

27:25.208 --> 27:26.514
[camera shuttering]

27:29.256 --> 27:31.562
- Uh, Dan.
- No, I'm-I'm sorry.

27:31.650 --> 27:32.868
- No, I-I..
- I just..

27:32.955 --> 27:35.828
I know. Um, it's..

27:37.003 --> 27:39.005
...not appropriate.

27:39.092 --> 27:41.703
Uh, I-I'm late.

27:41.790 --> 27:44.967
[female narrator]
Spotted, lonely boy
going from teacher's pet

27:45.054 --> 27:46.577
to persona non grata

27:46.665 --> 27:48.667
in the pitter-patter
of a heartbeat.

27:52.975 --> 27:55.325
That invitation
wasn't for you.

27:55.412 --> 27:57.545
You were never supposed
to be at that party.

27:57.632 --> 28:00.026
- What do you remember?
- All I remember is you.

28:03.638 --> 28:06.467
That's...not what
I was referring to.

28:06.554 --> 28:09.122
I can't remember anything else.

28:09.209 --> 28:11.124
Why don't you fill me in?

28:11.211 --> 28:14.257
I wasn't at that
party to meet you.

28:14.344 --> 28:16.216
- I was there for another man.
- Who?

28:18.218 --> 28:20.263
Your father.

28:20.350 --> 28:22.657
My father?
My father is--

28:22.744 --> 28:24.877
I know that...now.

28:26.617 --> 28:29.011
I took over
a girl's client list.

28:29.098 --> 28:31.710
I sent the invitation
without realizing.

28:31.797 --> 28:34.103
When you told me
your name was Chuck

28:34.190 --> 28:36.671
I realized that I had
the wrong Mr. Bass.

28:38.717 --> 28:40.153
I had to get you
out of there.

28:40.240 --> 28:41.415
I-I had to make
sure that you didn't

28:41.502 --> 28:42.590
remember anything
that you saw.

28:42.677 --> 28:47.421
The drink...so you drugged me..

28:47.508 --> 28:49.510
...and then snuck back
to Connecticut?

28:49.597 --> 28:51.120
What matters
is that I left you

28:51.207 --> 28:53.079
at that hotel to keep you safe.

28:53.166 --> 28:54.733
Safe from what?

28:57.823 --> 28:59.302
Hey, look..

28:59.389 --> 29:03.132
...the whole "eyes wide shut"
mystery has been fun.

29:03.219 --> 29:06.135
But if my father
was part of this group

29:06.222 --> 29:08.181
I have a right
to know who they are.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.052
Turn on CNN.

29:10.139 --> 29:12.925
Walk down wall street.
Go to Washington.

29:13.012 --> 29:14.535
That's who they are.

29:14.622 --> 29:17.973
And if they find out
that I let an outsider in..

29:18.060 --> 29:20.106
...lose the card, the stamp
on your arm will fade

29:20.193 --> 29:21.977
and stop asking questions.
Stop looking.

29:22.064 --> 29:24.545
- I'll protect you.
- How?

29:24.632 --> 29:26.590
Your own father
was one of them

29:26.677 --> 29:28.201
and you didn't
even know it.

29:30.072 --> 29:32.553
Don't contact me again.

29:46.480 --> 29:48.264
[laughs]

29:48.351 --> 29:50.571
A courier delivered this
to me this morning.

29:50.658 --> 29:53.400
Do I need a password?

29:53.487 --> 29:55.968
- The password...is Newport.
- Mm.

29:56.055 --> 29:58.013
'Cause that's where
my mom is tonight.

29:58.100 --> 30:00.102
Mm.

30:00.189 --> 30:02.931
[both laugh]

30:03.018 --> 30:05.978
Turns out I can still
apply to Oberlin.

30:06.065 --> 30:07.631
The face, Serena.

30:07.718 --> 30:09.895
Try to pretend
it's not totally tragic.

30:09.982 --> 30:11.897
You were right
about Dan and Rachel.

30:11.984 --> 30:15.683
Seriously?

30:15.770 --> 30:18.468
I must've picked
up on something.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.122
We need proof.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.823
You have proof?
Give it to me.

30:24.910 --> 30:26.520
Dan said that
nothing was going on

30:26.607 --> 30:28.261
so I should probably
just talk to him first.

30:28.348 --> 30:30.741
And give him another
opportunity to lie to you?

30:42.449 --> 30:43.885
[scoffs]
How awful.

30:45.669 --> 30:48.629
I'm so sorry, S.

30:48.716 --> 30:50.413
But this is the smoking gun
I've been waiting for.

30:50.500 --> 30:51.675
Blair.

30:51.762 --> 30:52.851
We have to get
to that meeting.

30:54.548 --> 30:56.376
- Dorota!
- Yes, miss Blair.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.421
Go get my dog back!

31:02.295 --> 31:04.950
Come on.

31:05.037 --> 31:07.866
This is a freedom
of speech issue.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.215
The school cannot
control what our

31:09.302 --> 31:11.130
children write
on a public site.

31:11.217 --> 31:12.653
[indistinct chattering]

31:12.740 --> 31:14.829
What your daughter
posted was slander.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.091
[Rufus]
'She should be
held accountable.'

31:16.178 --> 31:18.050
If slander's
the issue we can seek

31:18.137 --> 31:19.747
an injunction
against "Gossip Girl."

31:19.834 --> 31:21.531
Shut the site down.

31:21.618 --> 31:23.794
Shut it down?

31:23.882 --> 31:25.579
Yes, and a hundred others

31:25.666 --> 31:27.581
will pop up in its place.

31:27.668 --> 31:29.191
[indistinct chattering]

31:29.278 --> 31:31.019
This isn't some note
on the bathroom wall, Lil.

31:31.106 --> 31:32.238
It's on the internet that Dan

31:32.325 --> 31:33.413
slept with
a teacher, that's wrong.

31:33.500 --> 31:34.718
I agree.

31:34.805 --> 31:37.547
But should Blair
lose Yale over this?

31:37.634 --> 31:38.897
It's her whole future, Rufus.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.246
Well, what
about Dan's future?

31:40.333 --> 31:41.377
How long is this
gonna follow him?

31:41.464 --> 31:43.858
[indistinct conversations]

31:45.686 --> 31:48.776
Miss Waldorf, this meeting
is closed to students.

31:48.863 --> 31:50.560
I'm sorry for the interruption.

31:52.214 --> 31:55.217
But I have something
I think almosteveryone

31:55.304 --> 31:57.089
'here would wanna see.'

31:57.176 --> 31:59.787
Headmistress, if you'd
like to check your e-mail?

31:59.874 --> 32:02.268
[instrumental music]

32:16.804 --> 32:18.545
I believe it's called
exculpatory evidence.

32:20.242 --> 32:23.028
I love "damages."

32:23.115 --> 32:25.378
Hey. I-I'm here.
What's going on?

32:25.465 --> 32:26.553
If you wanted
to break up with me

32:26.640 --> 32:28.294
you could've just said so.

32:28.381 --> 32:30.383
I trusted you, and you
lied to me, both of you.

32:30.470 --> 32:31.775
Whoa. Wh-what?

32:31.862 --> 32:34.865
No, I saw you and Rachel
in the coffee shop.

32:34.953 --> 32:38.043
Well, yeah, Rachel was upset,
and I-I comforted her.

32:38.130 --> 32:40.610
I probably shouldn't have,
because she pulled away, but..

32:40.697 --> 32:42.917
Wait. Y-you didn't
kiss her?

32:43.004 --> 32:45.180
