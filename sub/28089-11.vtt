RITA: Cliff?

39:07.617 --> 39:09.341
Are you okay?

39:11.355 --> 39:12.355
Cliff?

39:22.232 --> 39:26.137
Oh, my God, you've fried
your brain, you stupid idiot!

39:26.170 --> 39:28.927
[CRYING] How are we gonna
get you out of here, now?

39:30.380 --> 39:32.005
[SQUEALS]

39:32.589 --> 39:35.685
[EXHALES]

39:36.081 --> 39:39.215
I didn't survive <i>Forbidden
Congo</i> just to die

39:39.250 --> 39:41.958
in some goddamn swamp!

39:42.952 --> 39:44.990
[SHOUTING] Cliff!

39:47.458 --> 39:48.630
CLIFF: I'm here.

39:53.589 --> 39:55.091
Let's go home.

39:55.699 --> 39:57.365
[CHUCKLES] Let's!

40:06.677 --> 40:08.326
Are you coming?

40:08.872 --> 40:11.382
CLIFF: No, you...  You go ahead.

40:11.414 --> 40:12.537
RITA: Okay.

40:13.284 --> 40:14.634
[SIGHING]

40:27.632 --> 40:30.032
[SIGHING DEEPLY]

40:35.306 --> 40:36.956
[SPLASHING]

40:41.911 --> 40:43.411
[GROWLING]

40:49.586 --> 40:53.056
[CLIFF SCREAMING]

40:53.090 --> 40:54.279
Now,

40:55.626 --> 40:57.951
tell me all about you.

40:58.329 --> 40:59.831
LARRY: There's nothing to tell.

40:59.864 --> 41:03.263
There must be something. You have
the strength of a 20-year-old.

41:04.255 --> 41:07.438
What do you do to stay so virile?
And please don't tell me yoga.

41:07.472 --> 41:08.839
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

41:08.870 --> 41:10.885
I can't tell if you're
laughing under that gauze.

41:10.909 --> 41:12.622
It's fucking yoga. I knew it.

41:13.263 --> 41:14.945
LARRY: No. More like RHIP.

41:14.978 --> 41:17.130
I haven't heard that since the service.

41:17.537 --> 41:19.016
"Rank Has Its Privileges"?

41:19.050 --> 41:21.044
LARRY: No, "Radiation Has Its Perks."

41:21.351 --> 41:22.771
I'll be damned.

41:24.088 --> 41:25.380
[SIGHS]

41:26.556 --> 41:28.833
Guess there's always
a silver lining, Lar.

41:29.404 --> 41:35.138
So there's been no one special in
your life for 60 years? Come on.

41:35.498 --> 41:38.232
What about your wife, Sheryl?

41:38.902 --> 41:40.724
LARRY: She died of cancer in '89.

41:41.201 --> 41:43.007
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

41:43.041 --> 41:45.443
LARRY: We weren't close, but thank you.

41:45.476 --> 41:47.115
And the boys?

41:55.191 --> 41:56.935
LARRY: Why put this on them?

41:58.322 --> 41:59.638
What good would it do?

42:00.592 --> 42:05.592
The truth is, I haven't really
lived much since the accident.

42:08.032 --> 42:10.177
You were my last real thing.

42:11.668 --> 42:14.537
And I still feel bad
about sending you away.

42:19.143 --> 42:20.435
It wasn't easy.

42:22.112 --> 42:23.287
But...

42:24.815 --> 42:26.404
I got over you.

42:28.271 --> 42:29.865
[SIGHS] Eventually.

42:33.423 --> 42:34.638
And I moved on.

42:39.429 --> 42:41.287
You should too.

42:49.115 --> 42:52.663
LARRY: You know, when I told
you I loved you, at the motel,

42:55.696 --> 42:57.255
I meant it.

42:59.247 --> 43:00.591
I wanted you to know that.

43:00.885 --> 43:03.599
In case I don't get
another chance to tell you.

43:09.659 --> 43:11.091
[SCOFFS]

43:12.163 --> 43:14.783
- I'm not dead, yet, for Christ's sake!
- [LARRY CHUCKLES]

43:19.271 --> 43:22.840
You really haven't
fucked anyone since JFK?

43:22.873 --> 43:24.708
My God, Larry!

43:24.742 --> 43:27.814
[BOTH LAUGHING]

43:31.115 --> 43:32.572
LARRY: Now that I think of it,

43:34.000 --> 43:36.806
there is a relationship
I want to tell you about.

43:38.655 --> 43:40.619
Go on. Go on.

43:41.693 --> 43:45.017
LARRY: It's not a traditional
relationship, per se, but...

43:48.632 --> 43:50.861
There's something inside me.

43:52.637 --> 43:54.423
I wouldn't say we're friends.

43:54.704 --> 43:55.884
But...

43:58.291 --> 44:00.259
there's definitely a connection there.

44:02.378 --> 44:04.431
For years, I didn't know

44:06.064 --> 44:08.838
what it was, or what it wanted.

44:10.492 --> 44:12.041
But now, I think I might.

44:20.164 --> 44:21.252
Hey...

44:23.333 --> 44:26.634
["MOON RIVER" PLAYING]

44:36.079 --> 44:38.033
Sleep well, my friend.

45:28.164 --> 45:29.664
Thank you.

46:13.244 --> 46:15.501
I'll be with you in a sec.

46:58.521 --> 46:59.572
[SIGHS]

47:12.202 --> 47:13.905
DARREN: Hello, Victor.

47:13.938 --> 47:15.507
Darren Jones.

47:15.955 --> 47:18.068
I greatly enjoyed our
meeting on Danny the Street,

47:18.108 --> 47:21.486
but I thought this time,
we'd get together on my turf.

47:22.612 --> 47:24.280
Welcome to the Ant Farm.
