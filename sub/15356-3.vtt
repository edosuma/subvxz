00:50.229 --> 00:52.179
I’m going to the restroom.

00:52.209 --> 00:53.799
Okay.

01:29.889 --> 01:31.289
What is this?

01:31.309 --> 01:32.559
It’s fire! Fire!

01:32.579 --> 01:36.769
Fire! Hurry!

01:46.079 --> 01:47.479
What is that?...

01:47.499 --> 01:51.259
Call the fire department!
Get everyone out safely!

Hey.

02:49.949 --> 02:51.819
You startled me!

02:51.849 --> 02:54.899
Wow! You're showing your true character!

02:54.949 --> 02:57.549
You ran off to save yourself
without even bothering to look for me?

02:57.569 --> 03:00.099
How can a man go into a women’s restroom?

03:00.149 --> 03:02.939
We all got out okay.
Isn’t that enough?

03:02.989 --> 03:04.019
Let’s go.

03:04.049 --> 03:06.329
But, what’s the bag for?

03:06.359 --> 03:08.759
Ah, to block out the smoke.

03:08.789 --> 03:11.269
Did everyone get out?

04:03.339 --> 04:06.836
Mi Jin and Do Jin are in this record book,

04:09.200 --> 04:11.230
but not in the government record.

04:11.319 --> 04:14.329
There are many kids like them.

04:19.869 --> 04:24.969
The kids went hungry, while somebody
embezzled the funds allocated for them.

04:29.969 --> 04:32.839
That's why the papers were shredded.

<i>Thank you. I'll immediately make a call to
the Vice-Superintendent to promote you.</i>

05:01.659 --> 05:03.539
Thank you, Assemblyman.

05:03.589 --> 05:07.545
Since there's an unlimited supply of tax
money, surely the district government

05:07.546 --> 05:11.679
can divert some money
from the funds for other purposes.

Don’t!

<i>If you look at the account books of Haewon
Construction, everything is perfectly clear.</i>

06:12.669 --> 06:14.890
The promissory notes and land deeds
that Lee Kyung Wan wrote

06:14.891 --> 06:16.953
don't match this ledger at all!

06:16.999 --> 06:19.919
These were all forged
to obstruct our investigation, that's all!

06:19.959 --> 06:22.617
Do you think we can issue
an arrest warrant just based on this?

06:22.618 --> 06:24.218
Are the judges all stupid or crazy?!

06:24.219 --> 06:27.269
Hey, you better stop doing dumb things.

06:27.434 --> 06:30.134
Who will believe a lowly prosecutor
from the Public Prosecutor's Office, Kid?!

06:30.215 --> 06:30.935
Chief!

06:36.609 --> 06:39.115
Is this power
that exists within true power?

06:39.116 --> 06:43.004
If he can't help, then forget it,
but he had to insult me.

06:43.059 --> 06:46.309
Prosecutor, there’s a package for you.

07:02.139 --> 07:03.379
This...

07:06.709 --> 07:09.349
<i>The 2 billion won taken out of
the Hunger Prevention Fund,</i>

07:09.723 --> 07:11.323

Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan.

07:26.529 --> 07:28.319
<i>Now, to carry out the investigation of
Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan,</i>

07:28.349 --> 07:31.195
<i>Prosecutor Kim Young Joo from

<i>By not publicly disclosing his crime, but

07:35.329 --> 07:37.969
<i>the law necessitates that all
Assemblymen agree to his arrest.</i>

07:38.119 --> 07:44.669
Just based on evidence that cannot be
trusted, and issuing an arrest warrant,

07:44.865 --> 07:49.365
that appears to be unfairly
targeting me in an investigation, everybody.

07:50.019 --> 07:55.769
This goes against the Constitution
when it comes to laws on arrests.

07:56.689 --> 08:02.489
It defies all the principles that dictate
lawful detention during any investigation!

08:03.250 --> 08:04.500

I have never, ever received
a cent of unclean money.

08:20.769 --> 08:22.729
That I solemnly declare!

08:23.499 --> 08:26.049
He's never taken a cent, I see.

08:28.189 --> 08:30.489
The cent that you're referring to,
I wonder how much it amounts to.

08:31.149 --> 08:34.328
<i>I sincerely plead with everyone.</i>

08:34.909 --> 08:39.039
<i>The assemblyman's self-defense

I ask members of the Assembly
to please be true to your beliefs,

and reach a decision
concerning the motion to arrest.

Hurray!

that law and justice still prevail in Korea.

- How do you feel now?
- What are your plans for the future?

10:45.419 --> 10:48.198
Aigoo. What do we do about this?

10:48.199 --> 10:50.083
You brought this all the way to the National
Assembly,

10:50.084 --> 10:51.673
but failed to reach your objective.

10:51.674 --> 10:55.594
Stop wasting your time going after
those who work so hard to establish the law,

10:55.614 --> 10:57.464
and go catch criminals instead.

10:57.548 --> 10:59.859
Isn't that what prosecutors get paid to do?

10:59.879 --> 11:05.149
And you gathering documents
illegally will not be forgotten.

11:05.969 --> 11:07.589
Get ready to resign for that.

11:07.629 --> 11:10.039
That wasn’t our doing!

11:11.989 --> 11:14.029
Move out of the way please.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.809
I wouldn’t dislike him so much
if his mouth wasn't so foul!

11:22.429 --> 11:24.959
What was the reason for not making
the evidence open to the public?

11:24.979 --> 11:26.519
What is your next plan?

11:26.539 --> 11:30.715
- Say something!
- One comment please! Comment please!

11:30.716 --> 11:32.759
Comment please!

11:38.719 --> 11:40.949
Something is strange...

11:41.039 --> 11:44.939
You're saying the bag with the bank cards
and the anonymous account books,

11:45.026 --> 11:48.576
were taken by a tall, skinny person, right?

11:48.659 --> 11:54.069
It happened so fast
that I didn’t get a good look at him...

11:55.129 --> 12:00.849
Do you remember seeing him before?
Maybe lingering nearby?

12:02.609 --> 12:04.349
Maybe?

12:05.069 --> 12:08.769
Me?
I don't like kids starving.

12:08.799 --> 12:13.592
Citizens are paying a lot of taxes, so
I want to know why kids are still starving.

12:14.609 --> 12:18.879
Yes, a while ago a man came
and said he didn't understand

12:18.912 --> 12:23.512
why two children from the lowest
income bracket were starving.

13:05.579 --> 13:07.849
Hey, check...

13:10.689 --> 13:12.059
I got five shots in.

13:12.079 --> 13:13.909
I got seven shots.

13:13.929 --> 13:17.639
You all need to improve; I got nine shots.

13:17.659 --> 13:20.819
When I’m in good condition,
I can get nine in too.

13:22.719 --> 13:25.099
How many shots did Professor Lee get?

13:27.617 --> 13:30.799
Really! Just one bullet!
What is that?

13:30.829 --> 13:33.349
He's making our team look bad!

13:33.759 --> 13:35.689
Don’t they shoot guns in the U.S.?

13:35.709 --> 13:38.302
Do I need to teach him
when I’m in a better condition?

13:41.579 --> 13:43.309
What?

13:44.279 --> 13:47.259
Hello? Hello?

13:47.289 --> 13:53.009
This is Mi Jin’s.
Now this is Do Jin’s.

13:55.469 --> 13:57.749
Now this is Mi Jin's!

13:59.079 --> 14:00.899
- Ouch!
- So bad!

14:00.929 --> 14:02.099
Why did you hit me?

14:02.129 --> 14:05.739
You’re eating all the good sushi
and giving kids plain rice.

14:05.789 --> 14:09.759
No, Unni. We can’t eat raw fish,
so Oppa is eating for us.

14:09.779 --> 14:11.419
Really?

14:11.439 --> 14:14.519
Your problem is
your fist always goes first.

14:14.549 --> 14:17.559
Are you a gangster?
Why does your fist always go first?

14:17.579 --> 14:19.359
Kids, let’s eat kimchi stew!

14:19.379 --> 14:21.549
It’s been fermented for a long time,
so it’s really good!

14:21.569 --> 14:23.859
Eat the rolled eggs too.

14:24.099 --> 14:25.569
This kimchi stew is really delicious!

14:25.589 --> 14:27.299
Really?

14:27.569 --> 14:30.089
It is good!
Did you really make it yourself?

14:30.139 --> 14:34.349
Delicious. Delicious, right?
Just like Mom’s fresh cooking?

14:37.959 --> 14:40.061
Why?
You said it was good.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.999
Ah! So delicious!

14:55.019 --> 15:00.699
Would someone like Lee Kyung Wan
know this kind of feeling? Probably not.

15:00.719 --> 15:01.859
It's because he doesn't understand,

15:01.881 --> 15:04.531
that's why he's suspected of embezzling
the Hunger Prevention Fund.

15:05.829 --> 15:06.979
What do you mean by that?

15:06.999 --> 15:11.289
Don’t you watch the news?
It was all over the news today.

15:13.069 --> 15:14.989
I’ll get going first.

15:20.489 --> 15:22.802
I didn’t even get to say goodbye.

15:56.399 --> 15:58.979
How can you fall apart
over a minor setback like this?

15:58.999 --> 16:01.239
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

16:02.159 --> 16:04.149
Who’s falling apart?

16:04.179 --> 16:07.019
I just wanted to be with someone
who understands how I feel.

16:07.179 --> 16:09.539
You were the one I thought of.

16:09.779 --> 16:12.529
We broke up because
I couldn’t understand you.

16:12.549 --> 16:14.549
So why did you come?

16:16.669 --> 16:20.229
By the way, you’re getting news
about Na Na, right?

16:20.249 --> 16:23.979
Yes, Na Na's aunt is my investigator.

16:23.999 --> 16:26.839
You really are keeping her on your radar.

16:27.249 --> 16:31.629
Kim Young Joo, I’m worried
that you’re too soft-hearted.

16:51.239 --> 16:53.839
Ahh. I’m full.

17:01.829 --> 17:02.789

Ahh...

17:36.379 --> 17:38.289
Ahjussi?

17:39.369 --> 17:41.409
Are you doing well?

17:41.439 --> 17:45.769
Of course I’m doing well.
Loving and receiving love...

17:45.819 --> 17:49.463
Ahjussi, what is repossession?
And auction?

17:49.498 --> 17:50.932
Did you borrow money from a bank?

17:50.967 --> 17:52.361
Why would I do that?

17:52.396 --> 17:55.999
I think Na Na did,
the girl you asked me to look after.

17:57.099 --> 17:58.949
Is she living a very difficult life?

17:58.999 --> 18:01.309
Yeah, it seems so.

18:01.339 --> 18:06.559
Whatever it is, please help her.
Seriously, I’m begging you, Yoon Sung.

18:06.579 --> 18:09.539
Ahjussi, have you ever experienced hunger?

18:09.569 --> 18:15.549
Yes, it’s the saddest thing in the world.

18:16.399 --> 18:21.309
It makes you wonder why you were born.

18:22.459 --> 18:25.979
It makes you want
to set this hateful world on fire.

18:25.999 --> 18:29.489
And it makes you want to die.
Why?

18:29.509 --> 18:33.649
Someone who lets a child starve,
must be a bad person, right?

18:33.679 --> 18:35.069
If you put it like that...

18:35.099 --> 18:36.809
Bas...

18:37.479 --> 18:41.089
Ay, I can't even express it in words.

18:41.139 --> 18:43.979
Someone like that should be dragged to the
gathering point in front of Gwanghuamun,

18:43.999 --> 18:47.299
and be torn apart by horses, ay.

18:47.319 --> 18:50.909
Ah, I suddenly want to eat the fake jambbong
and mixed vegetables that Ahjussi makes.

18:50.929 --> 18:53.599
I miss the food you make,
more than a mother's cooking.

18:54.679 --> 18:55.809
I'm hanging up.

18:55.839 --> 18:57.569
Take care of yourself.

19:12.099 --> 19:14.799
- This is from the Japanese.
- Okay.

19:25.219 --> 19:27.289
How is Huay Ni?

19:28.149 --> 19:30.579
Watching her cry from the pain
was heart wrenching at times.

19:30.629 --> 19:33.829
But I could take care of her,
which was a relief.

19:34.429 --> 19:36.409
After you send her off,

19:36.429 --> 19:37.729
go back to Korea,

19:37.759 --> 19:38.819
and go to Yoon Sung.

19:38.889 --> 19:40.019
What about you, Boss?

19:40.039 --> 19:41.989
Am I going by myself?

19:46.609 --> 19:48.269
That...

19:50.509 --> 19:52.389
That revenge...

19:52.459 --> 19:54.819
can you give it up?

20:07.499 --> 20:10.359
Isn't that the woman in Yoon Sung's photo?

20:14.809 --> 20:17.269
So this is the mother who abandoned you?

20:17.629 --> 20:18.999
She doesn't seem like
someone who could do that.

20:19.019 --> 20:21.329
How could she abandon
her own flesh and blood?

20:27.259 --> 20:29.779
Then, I'll go out first.

20:36.159 --> 20:39.329
I've been in politics for over 20 years,
so what occurred yesterday,

20:39.359 --> 20:42.529
of course I've been through
things like that before.

20:42.579 --> 20:44.579
It appears that he's a young prosecutor,

20:44.599 --> 20:47.459
and his youth and energy
are the cause of this misunderstanding.

20:47.489 --> 20:50.789
He's already a grown man,
I don't feel right ordering him around.

20:50.829 --> 20:53.219
I will try and talk to him.

20:53.259 --> 20:55.239
I'm deeply apologetic.

20:55.309 --> 20:58.029
No, you don't have to do that.

20:58.239 --> 21:01.539
If the prosecution issued an arrest warrant,

21:01.569 --> 21:05.319
then, doesn't that mean
there's a real cause for suspicion?

21:05.369 --> 21:07.729
What suspicion?

21:07.769 --> 21:09.819
I'm completely innocent!

21:09.839 --> 21:11.259
Are you really innocent?

21:11.289 --> 21:13.279
Of course!

21:13.449 --> 21:15.259
Good.

21:15.349 --> 21:18.259
Among all of us who are seated here,

21:18.289 --> 21:20.819
if there really is someone
involved in corruption and bribery,

21:20.859 --> 21:24.589
then, I feel that person should
be severely punished according to the law.

21:24.639 --> 21:30.029
It doesn't matter if it's me or my family,
there will be no exception.

21:30.059 --> 21:31.229
Everybody,

21:31.259 --> 21:34.029
please remember the goals we had
in our hearts when we first started.

21:40.809 --> 21:42.499
Did he become president all by himself?

21:42.519 --> 21:44.339
He hasn't even assumed the position
for a year,

21:44.359 --> 21:48.269
and there are rumors of a lame duck*. (*an
elected official who might not run again)

21:48.289 --> 21:51.619
I assume he doesn't want people to gossip.
People who don't bend, will be broken.

21:51.659 --> 21:53.469
If anyone stands in the way of our path,

21:53.489 --> 21:56.569
we can only step over him,
no matter who it is.

21:57.289 --> 21:59.289
I have a prior appointment.

22:00.209 --> 22:01.379
That...

22:01.409 --> 22:04.609
Can you postpone
the date of the book launch?

22:04.629 --> 22:06.007
Of course not.

22:06.008 --> 22:10.909
Especially at this juncture,
we have to be more aggressive than ever.

22:10.939 --> 22:13.339
I want to crush those
who think they can defeat us!

22:18.999 --> 22:21.259
Shim Jae Dong just called.

22:21.279 --> 22:24.529
He said he found out the tall guy
is trying to get close with those kids.

22:24.559 --> 22:26.339
Is that so?

22:26.769 --> 22:29.609
As long as we find those kids,

22:29.629 --> 22:33.599
we can catch the big guy, right?

22:35.509 --> 22:37.819
At the book launch,

22:37.859 --> 22:39.689
get those kids to be flower children.

22:39.719 --> 22:41.379
Yes, Assemblyman.

22:57.449 --> 23:00.309
Dad, did something happen again?

23:00.429 --> 23:02.819
You're back.
What about school?

23:02.839 --> 23:04.599
Of course I went and came back.

23:04.619 --> 23:08.009
It's just I had things to worry about, like
Dad, so I took a little break in the middle.

23:09.669 --> 23:13.759
For Dad, as long as I smell the scent of
wood, my worries disappear like smoke.

23:13.789 --> 23:14.699
For Dad...

23:14.729 --> 23:16.839
Is wood a remedy?

23:16.869 --> 23:19.369
No matter who it is, I really hope
he won't make Dad worry again.

23:19.399 --> 23:20.809
He's giving you more and more wrinkles.

23:20.839 --> 23:22.039
Aigoo.

23:22.069 --> 23:24.689
The leader in creating wrinkles
on my face is you, Girl.

23:24.709 --> 23:27.669
Ah, yes.

23:28.639 --> 23:29.619
Dad!

23:29.649 --> 23:32.439
Can I... change my tutor?

23:32.459 --> 23:33.279
Again?!

23:33.299 --> 23:35.639
There's someone who's really smart,

23:35.659 --> 23:37.779
and it's someone
who works at the Blue House.

23:37.799 --> 23:39.489
Therefore, his background
won't have to be investigated,

23:39.509 --> 23:40.979
and what time I go out
and come home can be regulated too.

23:40.999 --> 23:43.099
Isn't that killing three
or four birds with one stone?

23:43.139 --> 23:44.659
Even so...

23:44.709 --> 23:48.289
If the people here all find out
that my daughter is not good at academics,

23:48.319 --> 23:49.379
then where can I show my face?

23:49.399 --> 23:52.239
It's something everyone knows, anyway.

23:52.259 --> 23:55.969
I'll just pick a tutor who's really smart.
All right, Dad?

23:56.039 --> 23:59.239
Hey, hey, you should at least
discuss it with your mom!

23:59.509 --> 24:01.989
Ah... That girl...

24:18.879 --> 24:20.779
Are you late?

24:21.979 --> 24:24.529
This is great.
Give me a ride!

24:24.969 --> 24:26.769
Why should I?

24:26.789 --> 24:28.669
Don't you have a car?

24:28.719 --> 24:31.129
If we go in together,
people will misunderstand.

24:31.149 --> 24:32.789
Run like the wind.

24:33.099 --> 24:35.049
Really...

24:36.879 --> 24:40.609
Ah...
That irritating guy is really frustrating!

24:40.749 --> 24:43.329
Even if there's a misunderstanding,
it's I who stands to lose!

24:48.909 --> 24:50.299
Hurry and say it!

24:50.349 --> 24:52.829
Hurry and say yes!
Hurry!

24:52.849 --> 24:55.569
I asked you to answer me quickly!

24:58.939 --> 25:00.099
Hey...

25:00.119 --> 25:02.529
- Can you move so I can get out of the car?
- Answer me first.

25:02.549 --> 25:04.479
I told you I wouldn't do it.

25:05.799 --> 25:07.769
Are you all right?

25:11.619 --> 25:12.989
Professor Lee...

25:13.019 --> 25:15.709
You're really rough towards women.

25:15.739 --> 25:16.959
Women?

25:17.009 --> 25:18.499
Who, you?

25:18.529 --> 25:19.949
Then, am I a man?

25:19.969 --> 25:20.839
You...

25:20.859 --> 25:21.869
are a girl.

25:21.899 --> 25:23.889
The day after tomorrow
is my coming-of-age day!

25:23.919 --> 25:24.639
I...

25:24.689 --> 25:26.849
My English and math skills are really bad.

25:26.879 --> 25:29.719
If you raise my grades
so I can enter university,

25:29.769 --> 25:32.029
my father might give you a really big...

25:32.629 --> 25:34.149
reward, you never know.

25:34.189 --> 25:35.399
Good for you.

25:35.419 --> 25:36.979
Tutor?

25:37.129 --> 25:40.349
Which subject? Calculus? That's easy.
Algebra? Statistics?

25:40.379 --> 25:41.319
For English...

25:41.339 --> 25:42.709
The active voice? Or the tenses?

25:42.739 --> 25:46.140
When I started in university,
they called me the king of all trades.

25:46.141 --> 25:47.341
Are you going to do it or not?

25:47.879 --> 25:49.669
Didn't I say I wouldn't already?

25:49.689 --> 25:52.429
Not only is your brain bad,
but do your ears not work either?

25:52.479 --> 25:55.299
How many times do I have to tell you?

25:57.319 --> 25:58.759
If you don't want to tutor me,

25:58.789 --> 26:00.489
then date me!

26:01.119 --> 26:02.729
I will...

26:03.309 --> 26:04.629
Hey, Kid.

26:04.679 --> 26:06.559
I said I wasn't a kid already!

26:06.579 --> 26:10.179
I know Little Da Hye
has really high standards,

26:10.309 --> 26:12.669
but you're not my type.

26:12.689 --> 26:15.599
Should I buy you a full-length mirror?

26:18.589 --> 26:20.469
Yes, Chief.

26:20.659 --> 26:21.569
What?

26:21.599 --> 26:22.939
Hacking?

26:22.969 --> 26:24.529
I understand.

26:24.559 --> 26:26.749
Go sunbae, run.

26:28.649 --> 26:31.219
I will make him do it!

26:32.539 --> 26:34.639
Da Hye, let's find another tutor.

26:34.659 --> 26:36.349
That guy is dangerous.

26:36.369 --> 26:39.399
How would Unni know
if he's dangerous or not?

26:39.929 --> 26:41.949
Chief, you want to sit at the side, right?

26:41.979 --> 26:44.289
- Change my seat.
- Yes!

26:46.139 --> 26:46.839
Lee Yoon Sung.

26:46.840 --> 26:49.228
- Lee Yoon Sung!
- What?

26:49.289 --> 26:51.319
Why aren't you using formal speech
in the workplace?

26:51.359 --> 26:53.259
So what?!

26:53.529 --> 26:56.079
The first lady says she wants to see you.

26:56.129 --> 26:57.979
The first lady?

26:59.039 --> 27:02.169
I have a lunch date.
I'm just on my way out.

27:02.189 --> 27:03.259
A lunch date?

27:03.299 --> 27:04.379
Yeah.

27:04.399 --> 27:08.249
I will simply go crazy
if I don't see this person every single day.

27:08.279 --> 27:09.819
Bye!

27:12.869 --> 27:16.269
He rations every minute and second to date.

27:16.679 --> 27:18.039
That's great, really.

27:18.069 --> 27:20.309
Dad!

27:33.709 --> 27:34.669
Aigoo...

27:34.719 --> 27:36.019
How am I going to survive?

27:36.049 --> 27:38.259
You should have lived
so we could come back together.

27:38.279 --> 27:41.819
How am I going to live by myself?

27:42.979 --> 27:44.489
Aigoo, I'm so scared.

27:44.519 --> 27:46.339
Ahjussi!

27:48.339 --> 27:49.879
Yoon Sung!

27:50.069 --> 27:52.579
Yoon Sung!

27:52.789 --> 27:56.759
Huay Ni is gone!

27:59.189 --> 28:00.709
Bury it in your heart.

28:00.729 --> 28:02.969
We'll live a good life together.

28:03.909 --> 28:05.659
Wow, you look great.

28:05.679 --> 28:06.771
How do I look?
Like a different person, right?

28:06.772 --> 28:08.272
Oh, yes.

28:08.769 --> 28:10.459
Aigoo, my wife...

28:10.499 --> 28:12.689
- My wife.
- I missed you, Ahjussi.

28:12.719 --> 28:14.399
Me too.

28:14.519 --> 28:16.489
Have you eaten?

28:18.949 --> 28:21.019
Wow!

28:21.979 --> 28:24.239
Is this a house, or a palace?

28:24.269 --> 28:26.069
You know I don't like mess
in my house, right?

28:26.099 --> 28:27.149
Yes.

28:27.179 --> 28:28.499
Bring in your luggage and unpack first,

28:28.529 --> 28:30.639
I'll come back after work.

28:32.929 --> 28:37.309
Wow... The heating of this house
must cost a good amount of money.

28:57.229 --> 28:59.999
<i>Why aren't you using
your driver or errand girl?</i>

29:16.149 --> 29:19.299
<i>Have you gone money-crazy?
Go to sleep.</i>

29:19.469 --> 29:21.439
Money-crazy?

29:21.459 --> 29:23.149
Look at the way he talks.

29:23.169 --> 29:24.979
What an irritating fellow.

29:24.999 --> 29:26.539
What?

29:27.239 --> 29:29.069
No, nothing.

29:29.639 --> 29:33.829
Mi Jin and Do Jin have been selected to be
flower children at tomorrow's book launch.

29:33.859 --> 29:36.959
They are making paper flowers,
don't even try looking for me.

29:36.979 --> 29:39.509
Unni, what did you say?

29:40.709 --> 29:42.279
Hurry and make them.

29:42.299 --> 29:45.289
Unni is getting faster and faster.

29:46.269 --> 29:47.999
Flower children?

29:49.019 --> 29:51.829
Why does he need flower children
for the book launch?

30:00.759 --> 30:03.719
Mr. Yoon Sung, drink some coffee
before continuing with your work.

30:03.739 --> 30:06.339
This is your favorite Thai coffee.

30:06.359 --> 30:08.869
Ahjussi, your coffee-brewing skills
are also first-rate.

30:11.299 --> 30:12.689
Ah, it's so bitter.

30:12.719 --> 30:14.259
Was it always so bitter?

30:14.279 --> 30:15.509
Oh, your taste has changed.

30:15.529 --> 30:18.489
Ah, these few days I've been drinking
the coffee that person makes for me.

30:18.539 --> 30:20.099
Makes coffee for you?

30:20.149 --> 30:20.969
Oh...

30:20.989 --> 30:22.819
There's just someone.

30:23.469 --> 30:25.009
Work hard.

30:25.059 --> 30:26.379
Ahjussi.

30:26.409 --> 30:28.259
There's something
I need you to help me with tomorrow.

30:28.289 --> 30:29.099
I'm counting on you.

30:29.149 --> 30:31.916
If you say you need help,
I will definitely help!

30:38.609 --> 30:41.109
Public opinion has been getting really loud
over your issue.

30:41.129 --> 30:44.739
The law might bend to your will, but the
public might not necessarily do the same.

30:45.179 --> 30:47.079
I'm Lee Kyung Wan.

30:47.099 --> 30:48.779
I won't be beaten down
because of such a small matter.

30:48.809 --> 30:49.688
Don't worry.

30:49.689 --> 30:50.689
Do you...

30:51.209 --> 30:53.669
think I'm worrying about you?

30:53.699 --> 30:55.859
I've even forged the loan documents for you.

30:55.879 --> 30:57.499
That...

30:57.519 --> 30:59.949
They say the flower children are here.

31:01.589 --> 31:06.419
Could I... borrow that guy over there?

31:06.449 --> 31:07.819
Once I settle this,

31:07.869 --> 31:11.809
I should be able to find the guy
who put me in this troublesome situation.

31:16.839 --> 31:18.719
Hello.

31:21.439 --> 31:23.319
Ah, Assemblyman!

31:23.649 --> 31:25.339
I'm Reporter Lee Young Joo,
from Korea Daily.

31:25.359 --> 31:27.259
Regarding the bribery case involving Haewon
Construction and Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan,

31:27.289 --> 31:30.509
- The lowering of construction standards...
- I apologize.

31:30.529 --> 31:31.469
Let's go.

31:31.499 --> 31:33.469
Hold on...

31:36.769 --> 31:38.139
I don't think this is going to work.

31:38.159 --> 31:40.159
Make sure Lee Kyung Wan is more careful.

31:40.179 --> 31:42.569
You follow Lee Kyung Wan.
Watch him well.

31:42.589 --> 31:44.269
Yes.

31:44.659 --> 31:47.789
Hurry, come over.

31:48.799 --> 31:50.799
Is everything all right?

31:52.579 --> 31:54.309
You've arrived?

31:54.839 --> 31:56.109
You've come too.

31:56.139 --> 31:58.109
This time,
what evidence are you looking for?

31:58.159 --> 32:00.659
If you want to stir up something,
you better leave.

32:00.689 --> 32:03.669
Didn't you teach me to know my enemies?

32:03.689 --> 32:04.779
Of course I have to do so.

32:04.799 --> 32:05.949
Enemies?

32:05.979 --> 32:06.687
I would like to find out

32:06.688 --> 32:09.488
who’s using the citizens’ tens of thousands
of dollars just to buy a nail.

32:09.489 --> 32:11.319
I have to find out what's going on too.

32:12.669 --> 32:14.759
I'll see you later.

32:19.189 --> 32:20.729
He really has some guts.

32:20.749 --> 32:22.369
I'm sorry.

32:22.389 --> 32:23.949
That child still has a lot to learn.

32:23.979 --> 32:24.911
Having gone through turmoil

32:24.912 --> 32:27.717
in the political circle, he has become
very politically-driven as well.

32:27.779 --> 32:30.349
Only having tasted the perils of the world,

32:30.379 --> 32:32.569
will he come around.

33:18.839 --> 33:20.359
What did you bring these for?

33:20.379 --> 33:23.849
The assemblyman is over there, go greet him.

33:26.369 --> 33:28.589
Go wait at the entrance.

33:30.009 --> 33:31.809
Kim Na Na!

33:32.149 --> 33:34.219
Oh, Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

33:34.239 --> 33:36.689
But, Kim Na Na, why are you here?

33:36.739 --> 33:40.759
I had to bring the children
who have been chosen as flower children.

33:41.149 --> 33:45.039
Oh, I saw on TV, what you were investigating
at the club the other time.

33:45.069 --> 33:47.139
That was your work, right?

33:47.229 --> 33:48.579
Yes.

33:48.629 --> 33:50.599
You must protect the law.

33:50.629 --> 33:53.029
The justice of the nation is still alive.

33:55.389 --> 33:57.409
This is all a sham put up
by Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan.

33:57.439 --> 33:58.689
I know that too.

33:58.739 --> 34:03.599
No matter how he lies to the people,
he can't cheat my conscience, can he?

34:04.989 --> 34:07.489
It's good you can be so strong, Na Na.

34:08.579 --> 34:09.639
Let's go.

34:09.659 --> 34:11.059
All right.

34:14.759 --> 34:15.679
<i>Hello.</i>

34:15.699 --> 34:18.079
Today is the book launch for
Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan's 6th book,

34:18.109 --> 34:21.069
"The Day the Citizens' Tears Fall
is the Time I Weep."

34:21.089 --> 34:22.119
Thank you for coming.

34:22.149 --> 34:23.418
To kick start the event,

34:23.449 --> 34:26.649
Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan, who has recently
been feeling some political pressure,

34:26.668 --> 34:28.309
the defender of democracy,

34:28.329 --> 34:30.399
his journey so far,

34:30.429 --> 34:32.569
let's discover it through the big screen!

34:33.429 --> 34:35.739
<i>May 1st, 1948.</i>

34:35.768 --> 34:40.029
<i>Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan, born in
Gyeonggi-do, the second son of his family...</i>

34:40.049 --> 34:40.889
You...

34:40.938 --> 34:44.719
You can't believe everything
you heard on the news.

34:45.099 --> 34:46.279
Those are...

34:46.309 --> 34:51.668
fake images that people
who want to topple Grandfather created.

34:53.309 --> 34:54.918
All right, all right.

34:56.049 --> 34:57.379
It's these children.

34:57.399 --> 34:59.079
Oh, Do Jin.

34:59.129 --> 35:00.819
Min Jun.

35:00.869 --> 35:01.619
You...

35:01.659 --> 35:02.909
You know these children?

35:02.929 --> 35:04.639
They're from my class.

35:04.689 --> 35:06.709
The beggars from my class...

35:06.739 --> 35:07.959
Hey!

35:08.009 --> 35:11.359
Didn't you get all the coupons last time?

35:11.399 --> 35:15.009
Only children with empty stomachs
will do that kind of thing.

35:15.059 --> 35:15.759
All right, all right.

35:15.809 --> 35:16.579
Hey.

35:16.599 --> 35:19.369
All right, all right, Min Jun,
go to your mother.

35:19.389 --> 35:21.029
Yes.

35:23.029 --> 35:26.999
Oh, all right.
You guys are so cute.

35:27.019 --> 35:28.629
All right, what are your names?

35:28.659 --> 35:30.679
Soon Mi Jin.

35:30.699 --> 35:32.819
All right, Mi Jin.

35:32.839 --> 35:33.899
How about you?

35:33.929 --> 35:35.439
Soon Do Jin.

35:35.469 --> 35:36.619
Do Jin.

35:36.649 --> 35:38.959
All right, all right, Do Jin.

35:38.979 --> 35:39.889
You...

35:39.919 --> 35:41.509
That...

35:41.529 --> 35:43.089
You know that tall man?

35:43.119 --> 35:44.419
The ahjussi who looks dopey?

35:44.439 --> 35:45.689
How could you say that about...

35:45.719 --> 35:47.519
Hyung?

35:48.529 --> 35:50.629
Ah, all right, all right.

35:50.769 --> 35:52.289
You know him!

35:52.309 --> 35:54.889
All right.
Where's that hyung right now?

36:03.309 --> 36:04.559
Hello?

36:04.609 --> 36:06.959
<i>It seems you're looking for me right now.</i>

36:08.459 --> 36:10.689
No matter what, they're
from the same class as your grandson,

36:10.719 --> 36:12.139
that's going a little too far.

36:12.159 --> 36:13.439
You...

36:13.459 --> 36:14.789
Where are you?

36:14.829 --> 36:16.469
Where are you hiding right now?

36:16.489 --> 36:19.019
Stop keeping those frowning kids,

36:19.069 --> 36:20.699
just let them go right now.

36:20.729 --> 36:22.239
I will personally come to you.

36:22.269 --> 36:23.829
All right.

36:24.359 --> 36:27.269
If you don't keep your promise
to appear obediently,

36:27.299 --> 36:29.819
I can't guarantee the children's safety.

36:34.369 --> 36:36.029
Let's go.

36:52.439 --> 36:54.299
Take him in!

37:14.029 --> 37:15.809
You actually slithered all the way here.

37:15.829 --> 37:17.929
You're not too bad, I see.

37:17.999 --> 37:19.779
Who are you?

37:19.899 --> 37:21.319
Me?

37:22.059 --> 37:25.429
I'm just someone who hates people
who let poor children starve,

37:25.459 --> 37:26.709
a jobless guy.

37:26.729 --> 37:28.659
A jobless guy?

37:29.959 --> 37:31.299
Who are you?

37:31.329 --> 37:33.419
The fellow who stole my money.

37:33.449 --> 37:34.579
What?

37:34.599 --> 37:36.279
"My money"?

37:38.209 --> 37:40.779
How could taxes become your money?

37:40.829 --> 37:42.659
Isn't this just daylight robbery?

37:42.709 --> 37:43.719
What?

37:43.769 --> 37:45.599
Robbery?

37:47.399 --> 37:49.499
Do you think the nation is an orphanage?

37:49.539 --> 37:51.159
For someone whose parents
don't even know of their existence,

37:51.179 --> 37:53.709
why should the nation
bear that responsibility?

37:53.729 --> 37:55.524
The taxes of the nation,

37:56.487 --> 37:58.194
so what if I took a little?

37:58.279 --> 38:01.119
Even if I don't take it, someone else
would have done the same and taken it.

38:01.169 --> 38:03.814
Even so, for the nation and its citizens,

38:03.849 --> 38:06.169
it would go to much better use
if I use this money.

38:06.189 --> 38:09.899
That's how I become the warrior who uses
his body and mind to defend democracy!

38:09.919 --> 38:12.689
Mm, your body and mind?

38:12.739 --> 38:16.129
With just a little power,
your entire body and mind rotted with it.

38:16.179 --> 38:20.199
At such a young age, you already want
to become a hero, and do battle with me.

38:20.249 --> 38:24.339
Even so, the law will be on my side.

38:24.359 --> 38:25.639
Why?

38:25.659 --> 38:28.069
Because I have power
that you will never have.

38:28.089 --> 38:29.409
That's what power is like.

38:29.439 --> 38:31.799
That's why people all fight for power.

38:31.819 --> 38:33.669
People like you,

38:33.719 --> 38:35.239
I eat you for food.

38:35.289 --> 38:36.849
Food.

38:37.549 --> 38:38.579
Assemblyman.

38:38.629 --> 38:41.829
Just leave everything here to my men
and leave first.

38:47.409 --> 38:49.819
That should do it.

39:05.269 --> 39:06.879
I...

39:06.899 --> 39:10.709
at 13, I welcomed the 419 Movement*.
(*student-led movement, fought for citizens)

39:11.039 --> 39:13.019
But I...

39:13.139 --> 39:15.999
in the end,
saw the true meaning of democracy!

39:16.019 --> 39:20.479
<i>So what if I took
a little of the nation's taxes?</i>

39:20.499 --> 39:23.599
<i>Even if I don't take it, someone else
would have done the same and taken it.</i>

39:23.629 --> 39:25.670
<i>Even so, for the nation and its citizens,</i>

39:25.705 --> 39:28.876
<i>it would go to much better use
if I use this money.</i>

39:28.899 --> 39:32.519
<i>That's how I become the warrior who uses
his body and mind to defend democracy!</i>

39:32.549 --> 39:33.249
What is going on?!

39:33.250 --> 39:34.549
- Turn it off! Now!
- You want to become a hero,

39:34.550 --> 39:35.250
<i>and do battle with me.</i>

39:35.251 --> 39:36.649
Hurry, turn it off!

39:36.669 --> 39:40.519
<i>Even so, the law will be on my side.</i>

39:40.659 --> 39:42.249
<i>Why?</i>

39:42.759 --> 39:45.909
<i>Because I have power
that you will never have.</i>

39:45.929 --> 39:47.949
<i>People like you,</i>

39:48.339 --> 39:49.899
<i>I eat you for food.</i>

39:49.929 --> 39:51.539
<i>Food.</i>

39:56.589 --> 39:59.189
<i>Do you think the nation is an orphanage?</i>

39:59.219 --> 40:00.589
<i>For someone whose parents
don't even know of their existence,</i>

40:00.609 --> 40:03.719
<i>why should the nation
bear that responsibility?</i>

40:04.439 --> 40:06.389
<i>The taxes of the nation,</i>

40:06.409 --> 40:08.849
- so what if I took a little?
- That person, what is his name?

40:08.859 --> 40:09.559
He's that...

40:09.560 --> 40:11.299
- Lee Kyung Wan, Lee Kyung Wan.
- That's right!

40:11.339 --> 40:12.881
<i>for the nation and its citizens,</i>

40:12.882 --> 40:15.572
<i>it would go to much better use
if I use this money.</i>

40:15.573 --> 40:20.034
<i>That's how I become the warrior who uses
his body and mind to defend democracy!</i>

40:21.739 --> 40:22.849
Investigator Jang.

40:22.869 --> 40:25.979
Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan just described how
he committed his crimes at his book launch.

40:26.019 --> 40:28.588
Please issue an arrest warrant right away.
I'm heading over right now.

40:28.639 --> 40:30.739
I'm going to leave first.

40:32.899 --> 40:34.399
In Yong, take care of this.

40:34.419 --> 40:36.779
Either take him abroad to avoid backlash,
if not, send him to meet the Grim Reaper.

40:36.799 --> 40:39.829
- Don't let things worsen. Hurry!
- Yes.

40:42.599 --> 40:43.299
Let's go.

40:43.300 --> 40:44.929
<i>I eat you for food.</i>

40:44.959 --> 40:46.189
- Food.
- Where is the Assemblyman going?

40:46.209 --> 40:48.299
Where is the Assemblyman going?

44:02.700 --> 44:06.800
[To: Prosecutor Kim Young Joo,
Seoul District Prosecutor's Office]

44:12.519 --> 44:14.349
Ah, really...
What is this?

44:14.369 --> 44:17.359
To Prosecutor Kim Young Joo?

44:17.379 --> 44:18.199
Go!

44:18.219 --> 44:19.839
Contact Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

44:19.859 --> 44:21.299
All right.

44:28.429 --> 44:30.379
- That's right, it's this.
- It's this?

44:30.419 --> 44:31.279
Yes, this is right.

44:31.309 --> 44:32.009
What?

44:32.010 --> 44:33.939
This says it's for Prosecutor Kim Young Joo,
what is all this?

44:33.959 --> 44:36.659
- What is this?
- Who sent it here?

44:36.679 --> 44:38.559
What is all this?

44:38.609 --> 44:40.049
Someone contacted our news agency,

44:40.099 --> 44:41.449
and said if we went to
the Public Prosecutor's Office in Seoul,

44:41.519 --> 44:43.389
we would be able to see
something interesting.

44:43.439 --> 44:45.819
He said to go look
for Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

44:45.849 --> 44:48.109
This is something that
was mailed to you, Prosecutor.

44:48.159 --> 44:49.529
But this thing moves!

44:49.549 --> 44:51.499
Would you like to open it?

44:54.289 --> 44:55.789
What is this?

44:56.179 --> 44:57.489
[I Believe in the Republic of S. Korea]

44:57.490 --> 44:58.909
Hurry and take photos,
hurry and take photos!

44:58.939 --> 45:00.329
- Reporter Lee!
- Hurry and take photos!

45:00.359 --> 45:03.049
Hurry and take photos,
hurry and take photos!

45:17.249 --> 45:18.499
This!

45:18.529 --> 45:20.189
This is illegal!

45:20.209 --> 45:23.979
With regard to my arrest,
the National Assembly ruled against it!

45:24.009 --> 45:25.939
If it's an ongoing crime,
the situation is different.

45:25.959 --> 45:29.089
Didn't you reveal everything
at the book launch?

45:29.109 --> 45:31.689
You said you embezzled tax money.

45:31.779 --> 45:32.599
That...

45:32.629 --> 45:34.309
That...!

45:35.849 --> 45:38.929
I've you see
that Korea isn't a dead country yet, right?

45:42.539 --> 45:43.859
These are military dog tags.

45:43.889 --> 45:44.799
These...

45:44.849 --> 45:46.249
These aren't mine!

45:46.269 --> 45:48.559
I didn't even go to the army...!

46:02.099 --> 46:03.759
Yes, this is Kim Young Joo.

46:03.789 --> 46:05.949
Lee Kyung Wan, that piece of trash,

46:05.999 --> 46:07.879
I'll give him to you to handle.

46:07.899 --> 46:09.489
Hold on...

46:14.899 --> 46:16.999
No wonder you're the team leader.

46:17.019 --> 46:20.819
I was still wondering why we were
rolling in the dirt in the Golden Triangle.

46:20.849 --> 46:24.529
Ah, it's really as simple
as a small side dish, a small side dish.

46:24.549 --> 46:25.639
You were almost flying.

46:25.659 --> 46:27.779
Swoosh swoosh...

46:33.409 --> 46:34.609
What are you doing?

46:34.639 --> 46:37.309
I don't want to leave evidence,
so I have to throw it away.

46:37.379 --> 46:38.939
But,

46:38.989 --> 46:42.239
did you get the boss's permission
to do this?

46:42.289 --> 46:44.519
I don't think he'll let you off easily.

46:44.549 --> 46:46.909
Killing him isn't my method.

46:46.959 --> 46:49.069
Destroying him completely,

46:49.099 --> 46:50.999
that's my method.

46:59.079 --> 47:00.669
Where are you?

47:00.739 --> 47:03.269
The view by the river is nice,

47:03.289 --> 47:05.269
and the kids looked a little bored too,

47:05.309 --> 47:07.169
so we came to the park by the Han River.

47:07.189 --> 47:08.149
Why?

47:08.179 --> 47:09.409
Did you want me to run errands
and drive you again?

47:09.429 --> 47:10.249
Make me a cup of coffee.

47:10.269 --> 47:11.229
I'll give you two stamps.

47:11.259 --> 47:12.579
Hey, Lee Yoon Sung!

47:12.629 --> 47:14.349
- What do you...
- I'll give you the stamps once I get there.

47:14.389 --> 47:15.899
If not, nothing.

47:15.949 --> 47:18.769
The musical fountain at the Han River Park.
Come over and see for yourself.

47:20.619 --> 47:22.659
Ahjussi, you go first.

47:22.689 --> 47:25.189
Just take me to where the car is parked.

47:25.239 --> 47:26.319
Why?

47:26.369 --> 47:29.089
We should at least
have a party to celebrate.

47:29.689 --> 47:31.619
We'll have the party later.

47:31.689 --> 47:34.309
I don't know why, I want some sweet coffee.

48:09.559 --> 48:11.529
Kids!

48:13.439 --> 48:15.289
Kids, come here!

48:15.309 --> 48:16.709
Let's play together, it will be fun!

48:16.729 --> 48:20.079
I'm not in the mood to play right now.

48:20.989 --> 48:23.229
When I grow up, I'm going to leave Korea.

48:23.249 --> 48:24.499
It's all fake.

48:24.529 --> 48:26.549
There are no adults whom I can trust.

48:26.569 --> 48:29.769
I say, Little Miss,
were you lied to growing up?

48:32.009 --> 48:33.529
Don't be mad.

48:33.549 --> 48:34.779
Think about it from her standpoint.

48:34.799 --> 48:36.559
She really isn't in the mood today.

48:36.579 --> 48:38.219
Really?

48:38.269 --> 48:39.809
Ah, but there are no such fountains
in America.

48:39.829 --> 48:42.289
I thought it was really fun and cool.

48:42.309 --> 48:46.789
Ah, it's great for washing off the horrible
feelings after being rejected by a woman.

48:49.669 --> 48:50.469
Let's go!

48:50.489 --> 48:52.799
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

49:48.579 --> 49:50.739
Didn't you ask me to make coffee?

49:54.709 --> 49:56.619
This isn't bad.

49:59.019 --> 50:01.279
Ah, that's delicious.

50:02.369 --> 50:04.389
At first,
I wasn't really feeling great today.

50:04.409 --> 50:06.259
But seeing the kids cheer up,

50:06.289 --> 50:08.569
I've cheered up too.

50:25.419 --> 50:28.839
Why were these military dog tags,
hanging around your neck, Assemblyman?

50:28.859 --> 50:30.659
That...

50:30.689 --> 50:33.579
How would I know that?

50:34.469 --> 50:38.559
Listen to me,
if you were really a prosecutor,

50:38.579 --> 50:42.289
you would catch the guy
who turned me into this.

50:42.739 --> 50:44.984
In Korea...!
What's the system coming to,

50:44.985 --> 50:48.006
if an assemblyman
can be brought to this state?!

50:48.109 --> 50:49.909
Of course we will catch him.

50:49.929 --> 50:50.881
But why would he kidnap

50:50.882 --> 50:53.892
the assemblyman, and bring him
to the Public Prosecutor's Office,

50:53.909 --> 50:55.139
I'm more curious about that.

50:55.159 --> 50:59.349
Only that fellow would know about that,
how would I know?

50:59.369 --> 51:01.059
If you still don't know,

51:01.079 --> 51:04.069
I will tell you personally in court.

51:04.549 --> 51:06.379
Look here.

51:06.979 --> 51:09.219
Your father,

51:09.259 --> 51:11.499
could end up the way I did too,

51:11.529 --> 51:13.479
you know?

51:14.029 --> 51:16.939
Please do not insult my father.

51:17.349 --> 51:19.879
All right, all right, all right.

51:20.139 --> 51:22.089
Let's see.

51:22.109 --> 51:24.949
- Investigator Jang Pil Jae.
- Yes.

51:32.699 --> 51:34.049
Investigator Kim Mi Ok.

51:34.099 --> 51:35.369
Yes, Prosecutor.

51:35.399 --> 51:37.829
Please try and find some information
on these military dog tags.

51:37.849 --> 51:39.049
I already did.

51:39.099 --> 51:41.889
There was no information
on all three of them.

51:48.319 --> 51:50.799
Ah, he has drooled all over me again!

51:50.819 --> 51:53.479
Ah, children drooling when they're asleep
is very normal, why are you so harsh?

51:53.509 --> 51:55.869
In any case, it's wet already,
it has to be washed sooner or later!

51:55.899 --> 51:58.349
- This has to be dry-cleaned.
- Sheesh...

51:58.619 --> 51:59.529
Do Jin,

51:59.549 --> 52:02.389
wake up, let's go home and sleep.

52:02.799 --> 52:04.509
Noona,

52:04.579 --> 52:05.619
are we home?

52:05.659 --> 52:06.409
Yes.

52:06.439 --> 52:07.929
Goodbye.

52:07.979 --> 52:09.809
Thank you.

52:09.849 --> 52:11.829
Goodnight!

52:14.059 --> 52:16.129
Ah, it's cold.
Let's go.

52:16.159 --> 52:17.839
Where?

52:17.869 --> 52:19.619
Your house!

52:20.099 --> 52:21.759
Why are you going into a girl's house?

52:21.809 --> 52:23.349
Who's a girl?

52:23.399 --> 52:25.879
You, who flips me over her shoulder
every day?

52:26.599 --> 52:27.829
I say...!

52:27.849 --> 52:29.659
It's cold!

52:31.819 --> 52:33.509
<i>Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan,
who has been officially arrested by</i>

52:33.529 --> 52:36.179
<i>Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
of the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office...</i>

52:36.539 --> 52:39.569
What is that boy Yoon Sung doing?!

52:39.589 --> 52:43.129
<i>has expressed that he
will act according to the law...</i>

52:57.389 --> 52:58.559
[Father]

53:03.079 --> 53:04.959
You're not picking it up?

53:05.679 --> 53:08.519
<i>We're unable to connect you at this time
and are transferring you to voicemail.</i>

53:08.539 --> 53:11.789
<i>Please leave a message after the beep.</i>

53:12.489 --> 53:14.199
Is it a woman again?

53:14.239 --> 53:16.839
Which woman is it this time?

53:22.839 --> 53:24.179
Does that woman know?

53:24.209 --> 53:26.589
That you are a man who picks
out his vegetables and doesn't eat them?

53:26.609 --> 53:28.849
What kind of japchae has no meat?

53:28.869 --> 53:30.199
I did a lot of things today.

53:30.219 --> 53:32.969
Oh, you act like
you accomplished something huge.

53:32.989 --> 53:35.109
If there's no meat,
at least give me some tofu!

53:35.129 --> 53:36.289
The beans are the tofu!

53:36.309 --> 53:38.328
The meat that grows out of the ground.

53:38.329 --> 53:39.029
I...

53:39.030 --> 53:41.149
I don't eat beans.

53:41.839 --> 53:42.899
Oh!

53:42.929 --> 53:45.139
It's Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

53:46.219 --> 53:49.979
Wow, some people do such huge things.

53:49.999 --> 53:52.909
Some people only know
how to look down on side dishes.

53:53.029 --> 53:54.181
Do you not see
how some people run around

53:54.182 --> 53:56.423
trying to catch
corrupt government officials?

53:56.469 --> 53:58.089
Reflect a little, reflect.

53:58.109 --> 53:59.479
Is that something so great?

53:59.529 --> 54:01.239
Of course.

54:01.259 --> 54:03.499
With such people like
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo around,

54:03.519 --> 54:06.339
you have no idea how secure it feels.

54:09.779 --> 54:11.749
<i>The assemblymen are all rotten and corrupt.</i>

54:11.779 --> 54:13.629
<i>This is all a trick that they've discussed.</i>

54:13.659 --> 54:17.309
<i>The fact that the government
will protect these thieves...</i>

54:17.339 --> 54:19.919
<i>I think they should just get rid
of the government, it would be better.</i>

54:19.979 --> 54:23.179
<i>Who in the world should the citizens trust?</i>

54:23.209 --> 54:27.389
<i>A city hunter who hunts criminals
like Lee Kyung Wan...</i>

54:27.419 --> 54:31.149
- The city hunter should be given a medal.
- City hunter?

54:31.169 --> 54:33.479
That's pretty accurate, City Hunter.

54:33.509 --> 54:37.209
The City Hunter who sends all the bad
people to the Public Prosecutor's Office.

54:38.299 --> 54:40.029
Who is it?

54:40.079 --> 54:41.899
Who could it be?

54:42.749 --> 54:44.889
Who could it be?

54:47.129 --> 54:48.759
Hey, do you really have no tofu?

54:48.789 --> 54:50.079
Do you want me to go out and buy it?!

54:50.109 --> 54:52.519
Why do you have nothing else to eat
but kimchi?

54:52.539 --> 54:55.549
Then why in the world
do you want to eat here?

54:56.919 --> 54:58.119
Ah, sorry.

54:58.149 --> 55:00.169
Yoon Sung!

55:05.489 --> 55:06.859
This is for you.

55:06.879 --> 55:09.049
I saw you enjoyed the kimchi.

55:09.259 --> 55:10.949
Forget it.
You eat it.

55:10.969 --> 55:12.949
My aunt always sends me some.

55:12.989 --> 55:13.959
When I give it to you, take it.

55:13.979 --> 55:16.359
Next time, even if you demand it from me,
I won't give it.

55:17.849 --> 55:19.799
Ah, it will make the car smell.

55:19.829 --> 55:22.759
This doesn't smell.

55:22.809 --> 55:24.859
Thank you for playing with the kids today.

55:24.899 --> 55:26.709
Goodbye.

55:34.349 --> 55:35.419
[Father]

55:39.989 --> 55:41.389
Yes.

55:44.709 --> 55:45.909
Is that all?

55:45.959 --> 55:48.169
The method you said you had
for destroying him?

55:48.199 --> 55:49.999
How could you believe
the prosecutors and send him there?

55:50.029 --> 55:51.299
The inability to do anything
in the face of power,

55:51.319 --> 55:53.999
that is the definition
of the prosecutors of Korea.

55:54.019 --> 55:55.729
But I still wanted to believe in him once.

55:55.749 --> 55:57.169
That belief has no use.

55:57.199 --> 55:59.649
You will be defeated
by these weird ideas you have.

55:59.669 --> 56:01.309
You should have killed that fellow.

56:01.329 --> 56:04.869
The method where people
will never be able to forgive him,

56:04.899 --> 56:06.869
there's only this.

56:20.029 --> 56:21.139
What is all this?

56:21.159 --> 56:22.749
Kitchenware.

56:22.769 --> 56:24.629
Yoon Sung, Korea is really a heaven.

56:24.649 --> 56:27.129
One phone call and they deliver everything.

56:27.229 --> 56:28.189
This frying dish,

56:28.239 --> 56:31.289
it won't burn even if you don't add oil.

56:31.679 --> 56:32.759
This pot!

56:32.779 --> 56:35.769
Even if it doesn't have water,
you can cook radishes and pumpkins.

56:35.789 --> 56:36.829
This is a free gift.

56:36.849 --> 56:39.349
Where is there a heaven like this?

56:39.399 --> 56:42.289
Huay Ni should have enjoyed
good days like these too...

56:42.309 --> 56:44.379
What should I do about this poor person?

56:44.859 --> 56:45.849
Ah, Huay Ni...

56:45.869 --> 56:47.659
Ah, my head...

56:47.819 --> 56:48.669
How about the bill?

56:48.739 --> 56:50.449
Whose card is it?

56:50.809 --> 56:52.269
Of course it isn't mine,
I just got here.

56:52.299 --> 56:53.599
Ahjussi, are you crazy?

56:53.619 --> 56:55.379
Did I buy this for myself? Of course
I bought this to make food for you!

56:55.399 --> 56:56.869
Did you marry me?

56:56.899 --> 56:58.409
- Is this a dowry?
- Hey, Kid!

56:58.439 --> 56:59.661
I planned to cook food for you
with a maternal heart,

56:59.662 --> 57:02.211
why are you spouting so much rubbish?

57:05.589 --> 57:06.609
Have you tried looking for your mother?

57:07.149 --> 57:08.949
I heard she's alive.

57:11.669 --> 57:12.969
What use is there looking for her?

57:12.989 --> 57:15.039
Someone who abandoned me
to live a good life...

57:15.059 --> 57:16.109
But she's still your mother!

57:16.149 --> 57:18.049
Blood is thicker than water!

57:18.069 --> 57:19.779
Ah, enough...
Stop.

57:19.799 --> 57:20.859
Yoon Sung...

57:20.979 --> 57:22.709
Yoon Sung!

57:24.179 --> 57:26.159
This kid, really...

57:28.339 --> 57:30.219
I have to pack...

57:30.249 --> 57:32.049
I have to pack.

57:36.979 --> 57:40.449
Ah, that kid... His mouth is so hard,
but he has a heart as soft as tofu.

57:40.469 --> 57:42.449
He is old beyond his years.

57:44.609 --> 57:46.199
Pal Pan Gab?

57:46.249 --> 57:48.049
It's a guy who is like a ghost.

57:48.099 --> 57:52.599
No matter what, we can't track his IP,
and even if we find it, it's the Blue House.

57:52.619 --> 57:55.539
It seems someone is hacking into our system
and playing around.

57:55.559 --> 57:58.879
He's making a mockery of our
country's reputation for being strong in IT.

57:58.899 --> 58:00.039
Why don't...

58:00.079 --> 58:01.669
you kill me, Mr. President?

58:01.699 --> 58:02.869
No, Chief.

58:02.899 --> 58:06.479
We suffered a hacking attack while
I wasn't paying attention, it's my fault.

58:06.749 --> 58:07.759
Mr. President!

58:07.779 --> 58:09.559
I'm willing to die in place of the Chief!

58:09.589 --> 58:11.009
Ah, to tackle this,

58:11.029 --> 58:15.359
just strengthen the security of our
technology systems, don't worry too much.

58:16.039 --> 58:18.913
The important thing
is the embezzlement of the taxes,

58:18.948 --> 58:20.657
and furthermore,
it was carried out by an assemblyman.

58:20.679 --> 58:23.259
Allowing the kids whose lives
are already difficult to starve...

58:23.279 --> 58:26.169
The fury of the public is to be expected.

58:26.239 --> 58:27.659
Director.

58:27.709 --> 58:29.079
Using this incident as an example,

58:29.129 --> 58:31.439
we must make every public servant aware,

58:31.479 --> 58:34.179
and Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan must
be punished severely as the law dictates.

58:34.199 --> 58:35.669
Yes.

58:42.509 --> 58:44.329
Also...

58:45.179 --> 58:47.129
there were three sets of military dog tags

58:47.169 --> 58:49.699
hanging from
Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan's neck.

58:49.749 --> 58:51.069
Military dog tags?

58:51.099 --> 58:52.029
Yes.

58:52.079 --> 58:53.379
I don't know why,

58:53.429 --> 58:55.879
but in October 1983,

58:55.959 --> 58:58.509
there were people
with secret identities,

58:58.529 --> 59:01.849
who went missing on the same day.

59:01.949 --> 59:07.769
Although they shared the
similarity of being special agents...

59:08.349 --> 59:13.259
No matter what, we'll temporarily stop
further investigations.

59:39.439 --> 59:40.689
Elders,

59:40.709 --> 59:46.027
I'm sorry to bother you,
but do you know where this building is?

59:46.339 --> 59:49.779
Isn't this Pal Pang Gab?

59:49.809 --> 59:51.249
Is there...

59:51.279 --> 59:55.339
anyone who is familiar with Pal Pang Gab?

59:55.989 --> 59:57.889
Isn't this Kyung Hee?

59:57.919 --> 59:59.819
That's right, this is Kyung Hee.

59:59.869 --> 01:00:01.959
She was a pretty famous ahgassi then.

01:00:01.979 --> 01:00:03.719
Ah, is that so?

01:00:03.739 --> 01:00:05.139
Then...

01:00:05.159 --> 01:00:07.370
Do you know where she is right now?

01:00:08.119 --> 01:00:09.149
Yoon Sung!

01:00:09.179 --> 01:00:11.369
Yoon Sung, Yoon Sung, Boy...

01:00:12.209 --> 01:00:13.289
What is it this time?

01:00:13.319 --> 01:00:14.789
An iron?

01:00:14.829 --> 01:00:16.469
An entire kitchen set?

01:00:16.489 --> 01:00:19.689
You are casually swiping my card everywhere,
but a little bill will come soon.

01:00:19.719 --> 01:00:21.449
No, it's not that.

01:00:21.469 --> 01:00:23.329
I seem to have found it.

01:00:23.379 --> 01:00:25.039
What did you find?

01:00:25.079 --> 01:00:26.479
Your mother!

01:00:26.529 --> 01:00:29.219
I found out where she is.

01:00:29.269 --> 01:00:30.059
You're happy, right?

01:00:30.109 --> 01:00:32.369
You feel blessed, right?

01:00:32.739 --> 01:00:35.019
I've said this many times before, Kid, at
times like this, you're supposed to smile!

01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:36.869
Who did you find?

01:00:37.329 --> 01:00:38.099
Mother?

01:00:38.129 --> 01:00:39.929
Whose mother?

01:00:41.209 --> 01:00:43.179
When did I have a mother?

01:00:43.199 --> 01:00:44.959
Kid...

01:00:45.419 --> 01:00:47.579
Don't ever do anything like that again.

01:00:47.629 --> 01:00:49.889
I don't have the time...

01:00:49.959 --> 01:00:51.939
to look for someone who abandoned me.

01:00:55.449 --> 01:00:58.149
I'm busy.
Go out first.

01:01:05.699 --> 01:01:07.939
It's here, it's here.
This is the address.

01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:11.069
When you feel better, go take a look.

01:01:18.489 --> 01:01:20.789
[Seoul City Northeast Neighborhood Song
Ji Dong 77-9, Delicious Snacks Food Store]

01:01:36.959 --> 01:01:38.669
Here, enjoy it.

01:01:38.719 --> 01:01:41.629
- If it's not enough, let me know.
- Yes.

01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:12.689
- Here, take it.
- Yes.

01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:36.989
Welcome.

01:02:37.039 --> 01:02:39.139
You are Madam Lee Kyung Hee, right?

01:02:39.999 --> 01:02:41.049
Yes, how can I help you?

01:02:41.079 --> 01:02:43.709
There's someone who would like to see you.

01:02:43.729 --> 01:02:45.419
Who?

01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:52.469
<i>You're asking me
to capture the City Hunter, is that it?</i>

01:04:52.489 --> 01:04:53.779
<i>It seems you're following me.</i>

01:04:53.799 --> 01:04:56.389
I told you to kill them, not turn them over
to the Public Prosecutor's Office!

01:04:56.409 --> 01:04:59.019
<i>Don't feel anything for them anymore.</i>

01:04:59.049 --> 01:05:00.889
<i>The court says they want to sell the house.</i>

01:05:00.909 --> 01:05:03.139
<i>Once I leave that house,
I have nowhere else to go!</i>

01:05:03.159 --> 01:05:07.179
<i>Trying to do this by myself,
is really scary and tiring.</i>

01:05:07.209 --> 01:05:08.229
<i>Do you want to turn me in too?</i>

01:05:08.259 --> 01:05:11.859
Even more so between father and son,
there can be no forgiveness.

01:05:11.899 --> 01:05:13.699
<i>You will die in my hands.</i>

01:05:13.719 --> 01:05:15.134
<i>Ahjussi, it's Father.</i>
