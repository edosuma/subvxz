WEBVTT

00:08.375 --> 00:12.444
<i>I WAS NAMED AFTER
MY DEAD SISTER, AUDRINA.</i>

00:12.545 --> 00:17.850
<i>EVERY SUNDAY OF MY CHILDHOOD,
WE HAD TO VISIT HER GRAVE.</i>

00:17.951 --> 00:19.911
<i>MY FATHER AND MOTHER
ONLY HOPED</i>

00:19.986 --> 00:22.254
<i>THAT I MIGHT ONE DAY
BE AS LOVELY AND SPECIAL</i>

00:22.355 --> 00:24.289
<i>AS SHE HAD BEEN.</i>

00:24.391 --> 00:28.727
<i>MY AUNT ELLSBETH,
MY MOTHER'S OLDER SISTER,</i>

00:28.828 --> 00:31.030
<i>ALWAYS CAME WITH US
TO THE CEMETERY.</i>

00:31.131 --> 00:32.398
<i>SHE AND MY COUSIN VERA</i>

00:32.499 --> 00:33.632
<i>HAD LIVED IN THE HOUSE</i>

00:33.733 --> 00:36.368
<i>FOR AS LONG
AS I COULD REMEMBER.</i>

00:43.309 --> 00:44.610
THE FIRST AUDRINA

00:44.711 --> 00:47.579
WILL ALWAYS BE
THE BEST AUDRINA.

00:47.680 --> 00:50.416
<i>MY COUSIN VERA
DIDN'T HAVE A FATHER,</i>

00:50.517 --> 00:53.552
<i>SO SHE WAS ALWAYS TRYING
TO STEAL MINE.</i>

00:53.653 --> 00:55.087
<i>SHE KNEW HE LOVED
THE FIRST AUDRINA</i>

00:55.188 --> 00:57.456
<i>MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE
IN HIS LIFE.</i>

00:57.557 --> 01:01.026
I'LL TRY HARDER TO BE
MORE LIKE HER, PAPA.

01:01.127 --> 01:03.128
THANK YOU,
MY DARLING.

01:03.229 --> 01:06.598
<i>THE FIRST AUDRINA DIED
JUST BEFORE I WAS BORN.</i>

01:06.699 --> 01:08.434
<i>SHE WAS NINE YEARS OLD.</i>

01:08.501 --> 01:09.635
<i>NO ONE WOULD TELL ME</i>

01:09.736 --> 01:10.869
<i>EXACTLY
WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HER,</i>

01:10.970 --> 01:12.271
<i>BUT BECAUSE OF HER,</i>

01:12.372 --> 01:13.572
<i>I WAS NEVER ALLOWED
TO ENTER THE WOODS,</i>

01:13.673 --> 01:15.340
<i>OR EVEN GO TO SCHOOL.</i>

01:15.442 --> 01:17.009
<i>AND I CERTAINLY
WAS NOT ALLOWED</i>

01:17.110 --> 01:18.343
<i>TO TALK TO BOYS</i>

01:18.445 --> 01:20.045
<i>EVEN THOUGH,
ON THE RARE OCCASIONS</i>

01:20.146 --> 01:22.848
<i>THAT I SAW
OUR CARETAKER'S SON, ARDEN,</i>

01:22.949 --> 01:24.616
<i>HE ALWAYS HAD A SMILE.</i>

01:24.717 --> 01:26.585
AUDRINA,
LOOK STRAIGHT AHEAD.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.723
<i>SO I SPENT MY DAYS
A VIRTUAL PRISONER</i>

01:31.825 --> 01:35.027
<i>IN THE HOUSE
WHERE I GREW UP...</i>

01:36.563 --> 01:38.997
<i>WHITEFERN.</i>

01:40.300 --> 01:45.204
<i>THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE
ABOUT THE HOUSE.</i>

01:45.271 --> 01:48.674
<i>THERE WERE NO CALENDARS.</i>

01:48.775 --> 01:52.711
<i>NEWSPAPERS NEVER CAME
ON THE DAY THEY WERE DUE.</i>

01:54.247 --> 01:58.317

SOMEONE NEW IS COMING

03:06.986 --> 03:09.821
TO TAKE AWAY YOUR LONELINESS.

03:13.326 --> 03:15.093
MAYBE, ONCE

03:15.161 --> 03:16.328
YOU'LL LET ME
OUT OF THE HOUSE,

03:16.429 --> 03:18.909

03:37.984 --> 03:39.718
YOU'RE WONDERFUL, MOTHER.

03:41.254 --> 03:43.322
I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW TO PLAY.

03:43.389 --> 03:45.357
COULD YOU TEACH ME?

03:45.458 --> 03:46.625
SIT.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.501
YOU'RE A NATURAL,
MY DARLING.

03:58.838 --> 04:00.918
DID THE FIRST AUDRINA
KNOW HOW TO PLAY?

04:03.710 --> 04:05.744
THAT IS NOT
POLITE CONVERSATION.

04:05.845 --> 04:06.945
SORRY, MAMA.

04:07.046 --> 04:09.114
I DON'T FEEL WELL.

04:10.883 --> 04:13.018
I NEED TO LIE DOWN.

04:41.881 --> 04:43.515
AUDRINA?

04:43.583 --> 04:47.352
ARE YOU THINKING
ABOUT ME, AUDRINA?

04:51.024 --> 04:54.159
ARE YOU LISTENING
TO ME, AUDRINA?

04:55.628 --> 04:59.131
HOW CAN YOU JUST SIT THERE
AND NOT RESPOND?

04:59.232 --> 05:00.465
HAVE YOU LOST
YOUR VOCAL CORDS

05:00.533 --> 05:02.901
AS WELL AS YOUR MEMORY?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.872
YOU CAN'T REMEMBER
ANYTHING FROM THE PAST,

05:06.939 --> 05:09.074
CAN YOU?

05:09.142 --> 05:12.044
NOT EVEN FROM
A WEEK AGO

05:12.145 --> 05:14.746
OR A DAY BEFORE?

05:16.716 --> 05:19.217
LEAVE ME ALONE.

05:25.258 --> 05:27.526
WHEN THE NEW BABY COMES,

05:27.593 --> 05:31.263
PAPA WILL
GIVE UP ON YOU.

05:31.331 --> 05:32.831
DON'T CALL HIM PAPA.

05:32.932 --> 05:33.972
HE'S NOT YOUR PAPA.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.401
WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

05:37.303 --> 05:38.503
DO YOU EVEN KNOW

05:38.604 --> 05:39.838
WHAT DAY OF THE WEEK
IT IS?

05:41.307 --> 05:45.110
MY, YOU REALLY ARE STUPID.

05:45.211 --> 05:47.412
HOLES IN THE BELFRY
WITH BATS FLYING 'ROUND,

05:47.480 --> 05:50.449
THAT'S PAPA'S
SWEET AUDRINA.

05:50.550 --> 05:51.950
VERA, PLEASE...

05:53.252 --> 05:55.020
DON'T BE MEAN TO ME.

05:55.121 --> 05:58.657
YOU'RE THE ONLY
FRIEND I HAVE.

05:58.725 --> 06:00.859
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TELL YOU, THEN.

06:02.528 --> 06:04.129
TODAY

06:04.230 --> 06:06.732
IS VALENTINE'S DAY.

06:10.403 --> 06:11.570
WHOA.

06:12.939 --> 06:14.306
MM.

06:14.407 --> 06:17.642
FROM THE BOY AT SCHOOL
WHO LOVES ME THE MOST.

06:18.511 --> 06:19.511
CAN I HAVE ONE?

06:20.446 --> 06:21.546
NO!

06:21.647 --> 06:23.648
HE GAVE THEM TO ME.

06:27.553 --> 06:29.154
HE LOVES ME.

06:29.255 --> 06:30.789
I KNOW HE LOVES ME.

06:30.857 --> 06:34.326
I CAN SEE IT IN HIS EYES.

06:35.928 --> 06:38.830
MIRROR, MIRROR ON THE WALL,

06:38.898 --> 06:41.833
WHO IS THE FAIREST
AUDRINA OF ALL?

06:41.934 --> 06:43.735
"YOU ARE, VERA,

06:43.836 --> 06:45.070
YOU ARE."

06:46.239 --> 06:47.239
YOU'RE CRAZY.

06:48.908 --> 06:51.042
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S CRAZY.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.044
ALL THE PEOPLE
IN THE VILLAGE KNOW IT.

06:53.146 --> 06:54.980
YOU'LL NEVER
HAVE A BOYFRIEND,

06:55.081 --> 06:56.648
OR EVEN A FRIEND.

06:56.716 --> 06:58.116
THE VILLAGERS
NEVER EVEN MET ME.

06:58.217 --> 06:59.618
OH, I TELL THEM
ALL ABOUT YOU,

06:59.719 --> 07:01.019
THE HOME-SCHOOLED FREAK

07:01.120 --> 07:03.655
WHO CRIES AT NIGHT,
AND WETS HER BED, AND...

07:03.756 --> 07:04.856
I DON'T!

07:04.957 --> 07:06.091
AND WHO'S
SO SPECIAL

07:06.159 --> 07:07.559
THAT NO ONE,

07:07.660 --> 07:09.060
ABSOLUTELY NO ONE...

07:10.830 --> 07:14.733
WOULD WANT TO
BE AROUND YOU.

07:17.870 --> 07:19.371
PAPA?

07:19.472 --> 07:20.472
MM-HMM?

07:21.507 --> 07:23.074
WHY CAN'T I REMEMBER

07:23.176 --> 07:24.476
EXACTLY WHAT I DID
LAST YEAR

07:24.577 --> 07:25.644
AND THE YEAR BEFORE?

07:25.745 --> 07:28.947
WELL, YOU'RE
A VERY SPECIAL GIRL,

07:29.015 --> 07:30.415
WITH SOME
EXTRAORDINARY TALENTS,

07:30.516 --> 07:33.618
THAT YOU DON'T REALIZE
THE PASSING OF TIME.

07:33.719 --> 07:34.953
YOU WALK ALONE

07:35.054 --> 07:37.122
IN YOUR OWN SPACE.

07:37.990 --> 07:40.058
I DON'T LIKE
MY OWN SPACE, PAPA.

07:41.627 --> 07:43.628
IT'S LONELY
WHERE I WALK.

07:43.696 --> 07:45.797
I WANT TO HAVE FRIENDS.

07:45.898 --> 07:48.218
I CAN'T EVEN REMEMBER
EVER HAVING A BIRTHDAY PARTY.

07:51.471 --> 07:54.306
WILL YOU DO
THE BACK OF MY NECK FOR ME?

08:02.014 --> 08:04.082
DON'T YOU THINK I COULD...

08:04.150 --> 08:05.350
GO TO THE VILLAGE SOMETIME?

08:06.519 --> 08:08.019
VERA GETS TO GO OUT
AND MEET KIDS HER OWN AGE.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.120
MAYBE I COULD.

08:09.188 --> 08:10.355
AUDRINA, PLEASE UNDERSTAND

08:10.423 --> 08:11.790
THAT I LOST A DAUGHTER
ONCE ALREADY

08:11.891 --> 08:14.259
BECAUSE I DIDN'T KEEP
A CLOSE ENOUGH EYE ON HER.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.628
I WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN.

08:16.729 --> 08:17.996
I SHOULDN'T BE PUNISHED

08:18.097 --> 08:19.397
FOR WHATEVER IT WAS
THAT HAPPENED TO HER.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.132
STOP IT.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.400
I AM YOUR FATHER.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.303
IT'S MY RESPONSIBILITY
IS TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

08:26.439 --> 08:28.106
AND I ONLY DO THAT

08:28.174 --> 08:31.910
BECAUSE YOU ARE
SO IMPORTANT TO ME.

08:33.412 --> 08:35.145
YOU KNOW THAT,
RIGHT?

08:35.214 --> 08:36.214
ATTAGIRL.

08:37.316 --> 08:39.951
YOU KNOW WHAT
MIGHT HELP US RIGHT NOW?

08:55.701 --> 08:57.269
COME HERE.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.909
COME ON.

09:20.860 --> 09:24.362
LET HER COME BACK TO ME

09:24.463 --> 09:27.332
THROUGH YOU.

09:30.536 --> 09:31.536
JUST ROCK...

09:36.943 --> 09:40.312
CONNECT WITH THE ESSENCE
OF THE FIRST AUDRINA.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.815
YOU'RE GOING TO
BE SWEET,

09:43.883 --> 09:45.917
JUST LIKE
YOUR SISTER ONCE WAS.

09:47.019 --> 09:49.054
OKAY?

09:53.459 --> 09:56.194
BUT I ONLY SEE AWFUL THINGS
HAPPENING TO HER, PAPA.

09:56.295 --> 09:59.264
THAT'S BECAUSE...

09:59.332 --> 10:02.033
THAT IS BECAUSE
YOU MUST CONNECT WITH HER

10:02.134 --> 10:03.868
BEFORE
THE DAY SHE DIED.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.250
OKAY?

10:05.338 --> 10:06.838
EMPTY YOURSELF.

10:06.939 --> 10:10.842
LET THE SWEETNESS
OF YOUR NAMESAKE FILL YOU.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.183
CAN YOU
DO THAT FOR ME?

10:15.114 --> 10:17.782
THANK YOU, DARLING.

10:17.850 --> 10:19.517
I MISS HER SO MUCH.

10:20.753 --> 10:23.254
HEAR THE FLOORBOARDS
CREAK...

10:49.582 --> 10:50.815
<i> AUDRINA!</i>

10:53.285 --> 10:54.452
NO! NO! NO!

10:54.553 --> 10:57.889
NO! NO!

11:12.538 --> 11:15.407
I NEED YOU TO SEE
MUCH FURTHER BACK,

11:15.508 --> 11:17.776
BEFORE THAT
TERRIBLE DAY,

11:17.843 --> 11:22.681
TO A TIME WHEN SHE WAS
A LOVELY, HAPPY GIRL.

11:29.422 --> 11:30.889
HMM?

11:38.898 --> 11:42.033
THAT'S ALL DADDY WANTS.

12:03.222 --> 12:05.290
HAVE A GOOD DAY.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.458
SEE YOU LATER.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.726
BYE.

12:11.864 --> 12:15.800
AUDRINA,
IT'S TIME TO EAT.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.136
I'M BORED, MAMA.

12:18.237 --> 12:20.739
CAN WE PLAY PIANO?

12:22.174 --> 12:23.675
NOT RIGHT NOW, HONEY.

12:23.776 --> 12:25.677
MAYBE LATER, HMM?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.378
EAT.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.688
HELLO?

13:13.459 --> 13:14.826
HELLO?

13:14.927 --> 13:16.528
ARE YOU THERE?

13:21.500 --> 13:22.500
HEY!

13:23.502 --> 13:24.803
I'M ARDEN LOWE.

13:24.904 --> 13:28.373
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO
TALK TO BOYS.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.874
I'M IN VERA'S CLASS.

13:29.975 --> 13:31.910
I ASKED HER WHY
YOU DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL,

13:32.011 --> 13:33.378
AND SHE TOLD ME
YOU WERE CRAZY,

13:33.479 --> 13:35.313
BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

13:35.414 --> 13:37.215
THAT'S WHY
I WENT AND BOUGHT

13:37.316 --> 13:39.517
THE PRETTIEST RED SATIN HEART
CANDY BOX I COULD FIND,

13:39.618 --> 13:41.186
AND ASKED HER
TO GIVE IT TO YOU.

13:41.287 --> 13:43.354
THE BOX OF CANDY?

13:44.857 --> 13:46.391
BUT VERA SAID
YOU GAVE IT TO HER.

13:46.492 --> 13:47.725
I WAS WONDERING

13:47.827 --> 13:49.627
WHY YOU DIDN'T WRITE ME
A THANK YOU NOTE.

13:49.728 --> 13:51.896
MYSTERY SOLVED.

13:51.997 --> 13:53.231
I HOPE SHE AT LEAST
GAVE YOU ONE PIECE

13:53.332 --> 13:55.233
SINCE IT WAS ALL YOURS.

13:56.268 --> 13:57.202
WHY DID YOU
GIVE THEM TO ME?

13:57.269 --> 13:59.804
I GUESS SOMETIMES, AUDRINA,

13:59.905 --> 14:01.472
YOU CAN LOOK AT A GIRL
AND TELL RIGHT AWAY

14:01.540 --> 14:03.374
THAT YOU
LIKE HER A LOT.

14:03.475 --> 14:04.309
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT TO DO
SOMETHING DRASTIC

14:04.410 --> 14:05.743
TO GET HER ATTENTION.

14:05.845 --> 14:06.978
DON'T COME ANY CLOSER.

14:07.079 --> 14:08.513
IF YOU DO, I'LL RUN.

14:08.614 --> 14:09.347
AUDRINA...

14:09.415 --> 14:11.549
- AUDRINA!
- NO!

14:12.618 --> 14:13.651
AUDRINA!

14:22.862 --> 14:26.231
AUDRINA!
AUDRINA, WHERE ARE YOU?

14:30.603 --> 14:31.669
THE BABY'S
COMING TOO SOON.

14:31.770 --> 14:32.971
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

14:33.072 --> 14:35.273
I SAW YOU.

14:35.374 --> 14:39.711
I SAW YOU
GO INTO THE WOODS.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.080
WHY DID YOU DO THAT,
AUDRINA?

14:42.181 --> 14:43.381
I'M SORRY, MAMA, I'M SORRY.

15:06.939 --> 15:08.239
THE BABY?

15:10.542 --> 15:11.242
NO.

15:11.343 --> 15:12.911
MAMA?

15:18.250 --> 15:19.550
NO!

15:22.121 --> 15:24.722
YOU'RE ALL THAT
I HAVE LEFT NOW, AUDRINA.

15:47.546 --> 15:50.315
YOU LOOK SO MUCH
LIKE HER.

15:50.416 --> 15:53.217
OH, HELLO, PAPA.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.890
YOU LOOK SO MUCH
LIKE YOUR MOTHER...

15:58.991 --> 16:01.225
PLAYING THE PIANO THERE.

16:05.064 --> 16:07.732
I USED TO LOVE
SITTING HERE WITH HER.

16:07.833 --> 16:11.069
SHE PLAYED SO BEAUTIFULLY.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.838
I HEARD...

16:15.874 --> 16:17.241
WHAT?

16:17.309 --> 16:19.577
I HEARD THERE'S
A NEW PIANO TEACHER IN TOWN.

16:21.513 --> 16:23.114
NO.

16:23.215 --> 16:24.248
I'D LIKE TO LEARN
TO PLAY PROPERLY...

16:24.316 --> 16:25.683
I WANT YOU TO CONCENTRATE

16:25.751 --> 16:26.851
ON BEING MORE LIKE
THE FIRST AUDRINA.

16:26.952 --> 16:28.953
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING OF YOU.

16:29.021 --> 16:30.822
I UNDERSTAND, PAPA.

16:32.591 --> 16:34.292
I DO, BUT...

16:37.463 --> 16:41.499
I WANT TO BE LOVED
FOR WHO I AM, AS WELL...

16:41.600 --> 16:44.068
MY OWN MERITS.

17:05.656 --> 17:08.393
I'VE MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES
IN RAISING MY OWN DAUGHTER.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.996
THERE'S NO QUESTION THERE.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.967
AUDRINA IS A KIND GIRL.

17:16.068 --> 17:18.069
AT HEART, I BELIEVE
YOU WANT HER TO BE HAPPY.

17:18.170 --> 17:20.238
OF COURSE I DO.

17:20.305 --> 17:21.672
SHE'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
IN THE WORLD TO ME.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.473
BEING COOPED UP
IN THIS MAUSOLEUM

17:23.541 --> 17:24.582
ISN'T GOOD FOR HER.

17:25.778 --> 17:26.676
I'M AFRAID

17:26.744 --> 17:27.944
IF YOU DON'T
RELAX YOUR GRIP,

17:28.047 --> 17:31.949
YOU'LL LOSE HER.

17:37.656 --> 17:38.656
AUDRINA!

17:43.495 --> 17:45.063
BE SURE
TO STAY ON THE ROAD.

17:45.164 --> 17:47.165
AND, UM...

17:47.232 --> 17:48.699
YOU'LL COME STRAIGHT HOME
AFTER THE LESSON,

17:48.767 --> 17:49.667
DO YOU HEAR?

17:49.768 --> 17:51.402
YES, PAPA.

17:51.503 --> 17:52.804
I PROMISE.

18:18.730 --> 18:19.730
MR. RENSDALE?

18:19.832 --> 18:21.432
I'M AUDRINA.

18:21.533 --> 18:22.834
PLEASE, CALL ME LAMAR.

18:22.935 --> 18:23.968
COME IN, COME IN.

18:58.971 --> 18:59.871
THAT'S IT.

18:59.938 --> 19:01.239
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

19:02.474 --> 19:03.908
MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME
A LONG TIME AGO.

19:04.009 --> 19:05.510
YOUR MOTHER IS A PIANIST?

19:05.611 --> 19:06.844
SHE WAS.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.280
BUT SHE PASSED ON.

19:09.381 --> 19:11.249
I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.417
SHE WAS AN AMAZING PIANIST.

19:15.120 --> 19:16.954
IN FACT, SHE WAS
ACCEPTED AT JUILLIARD.

19:17.055 --> 19:18.289
AH.

19:18.390 --> 19:19.790
I WENT TO JUILLIARD.

19:20.659 --> 19:21.559
YOU DID?

19:21.660 --> 19:22.560
MM.

19:22.628 --> 19:23.628
IN NEW YORK?

19:24.730 --> 19:26.297
I'LL GET
BACK THERE ONE DAY,

19:26.398 --> 19:27.365
BUT FOR NOW,

19:27.466 --> 19:29.666
I PREFER
THE COUNTRY LIFE.

19:31.570 --> 19:33.404
I WOULD LOVE TO GO
TO NEW YORK.

19:33.472 --> 19:34.338
LUCKILY,

19:34.439 --> 19:36.474
THE CITY HAS COME TO YOU.

19:57.563 --> 19:59.330
IS SOMEONE THERE?

20:02.301 --> 20:03.501
ARDEN.

20:03.602 --> 20:05.369
YOU... YOU SCARED ME.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.605
HELLO, AUDRINA.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.574
LOOK AT YOU WITH A BIKE.

20:09.675 --> 20:11.576
MOVING UP.

20:11.677 --> 20:13.411
I'M TAKING PIANO
LESSONS IN TOWN NOW.

20:13.512 --> 20:14.378
THAT'S GREAT.

20:14.479 --> 20:16.180
YEAH, ONCE A WEEK.

20:16.281 --> 20:18.182
WOW, I'D LOVE TO
HEAR YOU PLAY SOMETIME.

20:18.283 --> 20:19.850
OH, I'M NOT NEARLY GOOD ENOUGH.

20:19.952 --> 20:20.952
I BET YOU ARE.

20:24.856 --> 20:26.257
I WAS WONDERING...

20:26.325 --> 20:28.565
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE
A PICNIC WITH ME SOMETIME

20:28.594 --> 20:29.660
DOWN BY THE RIVER?

20:29.761 --> 20:30.761
WE COULD GO SWIMMING.

20:30.829 --> 20:33.598
I COULD TEACH YOU
HOW TO FISH.

20:33.699 --> 20:36.300
YEAH, I'D LIKE THAT.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.836
I'M NOT SURE
I CAN GET AWAY, THOUGH.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.439
HOW ABOUT THIS SATURDAY?

20:43.308 --> 20:44.375
YEAH, I'LL TRY.

20:47.512 --> 20:48.613
I'D BETTER GET BACK.

20:48.714 --> 20:50.381
PAPA'S WAITING FOR ME.

20:50.449 --> 20:51.582
I'LL SEE YOU ON SATURDAY,
THEN.

20:51.683 --> 20:52.750
SEE YOU SATURDAY.

21:10.035 --> 21:12.003
WHO SAID YOU COULD
RIDE MY BICYCLE?

21:12.104 --> 21:13.437
UM...

21:13.538 --> 21:15.273
PAPA DID.

21:15.340 --> 21:16.540
I HAD TO GO INTO TOWN.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.609
OH, RIGHT.

21:18.677 --> 21:20.478
I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR NEW LESSONS.

21:20.545 --> 21:23.314
YOU SURE ARE WRAPPED UP
IN MUSIC ALL OF A SUDDEN.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.822
WHAT'S HE LIKE,
YOUR MR. RENSDALE?

21:25.851 --> 21:26.951
HE'S NICE.

21:27.019 --> 21:29.020
THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT, STUPID.

21:29.087 --> 21:31.355
THE GIRLS IN TOWN SAY

21:31.423 --> 21:33.291
HE IS SEXY AND HANDSOME,

21:33.358 --> 21:35.493
AND A BACHELOR.

21:35.594 --> 21:36.827
YOU KNOW, I THINK

21:36.928 --> 21:39.497
I MIGHT LIKE TO TAKE
SOME PIANO LESSONS, TOO.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.113
WHOOPS.

21:57.416 --> 21:58.316
HEY, MAYBE

21:58.417 --> 22:00.318
YOU COULD GUIDE MY FINGERS?

22:00.419 --> 22:02.953
YOU KNOW, PUT YOUR HANDS
OVER MINE, AND GUIDE THEM.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.356
LIKE WE'RE DANCING.

22:05.457 --> 22:06.590
I'M NOT SURE
HOW THAT WOULD WORK.

22:06.692 --> 22:07.892
UM...

22:07.959 --> 22:09.427
WE COULD JUST TRY IT.

22:11.630 --> 22:12.830
OKAY.

22:16.968 --> 22:18.269
HERE.

22:19.438 --> 22:21.706
TRY IT LIKE THIS.

22:30.649 --> 22:33.150
AUDRINA, YOU REALLY
MUST TRY THIS TECHNIQUE.

22:33.218 --> 22:34.251
IT IS WONDERFUL.

23:05.684 --> 23:07.084
HMM.

23:18.029 --> 23:19.597
READY TO CATCH LUNCH?

23:21.133 --> 23:22.566
I THOUGHT WE HAD A PICNIC.

23:22.667 --> 23:24.702
MY MOM MADE SANDWICHES

23:24.770 --> 23:26.337
IN CASE WE DON'T
CATCH THE BIG ONE.

23:26.438 --> 23:28.906
YOU LOOK NICE.

23:29.007 --> 23:30.441
THANKS.

23:30.542 --> 23:31.842
SO DO YOU.

23:39.551 --> 23:41.619
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL HERE.

23:41.720 --> 23:43.854
SO PEACEFUL.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.790
I KNEW
YOU'D LIKE IT.

23:45.891 --> 23:49.827
I COME HERE WHENEVER
I HAVE TO CLEAR MY HEAD.

23:49.928 --> 23:51.262
IT'S A WONDERFUL DAY.

23:51.363 --> 23:54.365
WE SHOULD DO IT
EVERY SATURDAY.

23:54.466 --> 23:55.746
THAT'D BE NICE.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.970
YOU'RE MY FIRST
FRIEND, ARDEN.

24:00.071 --> 24:02.506
I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU
FOR THAT.

24:07.312 --> 24:10.414
AUDRINA...

24:11.950 --> 24:14.685
I HAVE TO TELL YOU
SOMETHING ABOUT ME ONE DAY,

24:14.786 --> 24:17.721
AND YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO LIKE ME AFTER I DO.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.857
THEN DON'T TELL ME, THEN.

24:20.926 --> 24:23.406
I DON'T WANT TO STOP
LIKING YOU, ARDEN.

24:26.498 --> 24:28.699
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL DAY!

24:28.800 --> 24:30.334
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

24:31.470 --> 24:33.204
WELL, YOU DON'T OWN THE LAKE.

24:35.006 --> 24:36.674
OH, IT IS A HOT ONE.

24:45.484 --> 24:46.617
ARDEN,

24:46.718 --> 24:47.998
WOULD YOU MIND

24:48.086 --> 24:49.820
HELPING ME SMOOTH ON
SOME OF MY SUNSCREEN?

24:49.921 --> 24:51.255
WITH MY
LIGHT-SENSITIVE SKIN,

24:51.323 --> 24:54.458
I GET A TERRIBLE BURN
IF I'M NOT CAREFUL.

24:54.559 --> 24:56.393
GO AHEAD.

24:56.495 --> 24:57.495
I'LL PACK UP.

25:09.774 --> 25:11.108
VERA...

25:12.277 --> 25:13.277
WHAT?

25:13.311 --> 25:14.578
I DON'T WANT PALE STRAP MARKS,

25:14.679 --> 25:16.146
AND BESIDES,

25:16.248 --> 25:18.215
IT'S NOT LIKE ARDEN
HASN'T SEEN BARE BOOBS BEFORE,

25:18.316 --> 25:20.017
RIGHT?

25:26.725 --> 25:28.959
VERA, DID YOU TAKE MY CLOTHES?

25:39.437 --> 25:41.071
WHERE IS MY DAUGHTER?

25:41.172 --> 25:42.606
SHE WAS HERE A MOMENT AGO...

25:42.707 --> 25:43.807
IF THAT WERE TRUE,
I'D HAVE SEEN HER ON THE WAY IN.

25:43.909 --> 25:45.676
WHERE'S MY DAUGHTER!

25:46.845 --> 25:47.745
WHERE IS SHE?

25:47.846 --> 25:49.480
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO HER?

25:50.448 --> 25:51.448
WHERE IS MY DAUGHTER?

25:51.550 --> 25:52.583
I'M RIGHT HERE!

25:52.684 --> 25:53.584
HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING!

25:53.685 --> 25:55.586
WHAT?

25:55.687 --> 25:56.854
WHAT...

25:56.922 --> 25:58.889
WHERE ARE YOUR CLOTHES?

25:58.990 --> 26:00.090
VERA HID THEM.

26:00.191 --> 26:01.511
AS IF I'M GOING TO
BELIEVE THAT?

26:01.593 --> 26:02.593
IT'S TRUE.

26:02.627 --> 26:03.928
STAY AWAY FROM HER!

26:04.029 --> 26:06.664
BUT VERA'S THE ONE
WHO HID MY CLOTHES!

26:06.765 --> 26:09.333
- NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THAT!
- PAPA, STOP!

26:09.434 --> 26:10.534
PAPA, PLEASE STOP.

26:10.635 --> 26:12.570
I'M SORRY!

26:12.671 --> 26:14.872
PAPA, PLEASE, NO!

26:17.909 --> 26:19.843
LOOK.

26:19.945 --> 26:20.978
LOOK...

26:21.079 --> 26:23.781
THIS IS WHERE...

26:23.882 --> 26:30.321
THIS IS WHERE WE FOUND
SWEET AUDRINA.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.257
HER DEAD BODY
WAS SPRAWLED OUT THERE.

26:33.358 --> 26:34.525
FIRST WE THOUGHT

26:34.626 --> 26:36.026
THAT SHE'D BEEN
STRUCK BY LIGHTNING.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.761
BUT THEN...

26:37.862 --> 26:40.364
THERE WAS EVIDENCE

26:40.465 --> 26:42.766
THAT IT WAS NOT
THE WORK OF GOD.

26:42.867 --> 26:43.867
I'M SORRY.

26:43.935 --> 26:44.835
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

26:44.936 --> 26:45.976
YES. YES, I'M SORRY.

26:46.004 --> 26:47.104
SHE WAS ONLY NINE YEARS OLD.

26:47.205 --> 26:49.045
I KNOW, I'M SORRY!

26:49.140 --> 26:50.874
WHY CAN'T YOU BE SWEET

26:50.976 --> 26:52.910
AND PURE...

26:53.011 --> 26:55.045
OBEDIENT,

26:55.146 --> 26:56.513
LIKE THE FIRST AUDRINA?

26:56.615 --> 26:59.016
I'M TRYING! I'M SORRY!

27:02.654 --> 27:04.021
I'M SO SORRY...

27:04.122 --> 27:06.590
OKAY. OKAY.

27:10.595 --> 27:12.630
THIS IS YOUR FAULT, VERA.

27:12.697 --> 27:13.797
YOU LED PAPA TO US.

27:13.865 --> 27:16.433
YOU HID MY CLOTHES.

27:16.534 --> 27:17.568
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.

27:17.669 --> 27:19.036
JUST LEAVE
ME AND ARDEN ALONE.

27:19.137 --> 27:20.471
OH, PLEASE, I WANT
A MAN, NOT A BOY.

27:20.572 --> 27:22.106
QUIET, GIRLS.

27:22.173 --> 27:24.441
YOU'VE ALREADY UPSET PAPA
ENOUGH.

27:38.823 --> 27:41.291
SIR, I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE

27:41.393 --> 27:42.626
FOR NOT COMING
TO ASK PERMISSION

27:42.694 --> 27:43.560
BEFORE TAKING YOUR DAUGHTER
ON A DATE.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.395
I WAS WRONG.

27:44.496 --> 27:45.496
LISTEN.

27:45.597 --> 27:46.664
I THOUGHT I MADE MYSELF CLEAR

27:46.765 --> 27:47.698
WHEN I SAID
DON'T COME HERE.

27:47.799 --> 27:48.839
NO, NO, NO, ARE YOU CRAZY?

27:48.933 --> 27:50.234
YOU WILL JUST
MAKE IT WORSE.

27:50.301 --> 27:51.301
BUT HE CAME
HERE FOR ME.

27:51.369 --> 27:53.729
I MEAN YOU
NO DISRESPECT...

27:55.607 --> 27:57.727
I'M SORRY, AUDRINA!

27:58.043 --> 27:59.109
I'M SORRY.

28:01.212 --> 28:03.247
YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE
ANOTHER WORD I SAY,

28:03.314 --> 28:04.415
BUT YOU BELIEVE THIS...

28:04.516 --> 28:05.449
YOU ARE NOT RUNNING AWAY

28:05.550 --> 28:06.750
WITH THAT BOY.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.085
I'LL FOLLOW YOU
TO THE END OF THE EARTH

28:08.153 --> 28:09.353
TO BRING YOU BACK HERE
WHERE YOU BELONG.

28:09.421 --> 28:10.521
THERE'S ONE PLACE
YOU CAN'T FOLLOW ME.

28:10.622 --> 28:11.488
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

28:11.589 --> 28:12.923
I'M NOT AFRAID OF DYING!

28:12.991 --> 28:14.391
NO. AUDRINA...
AUDRINA, PLEASE.

28:14.492 --> 28:16.226
IT'S LIKE
I'M ALREADY DEAD!

28:16.327 --> 28:17.828
THIS HOUSE IS MY COFFIN!

28:37.982 --> 28:40.651
WHEN YOU AND LUCIETTA
FIRST TOLD ME

28:40.752 --> 28:42.232
WHAT YOU PLANNED TO DO
ABOUT AUDRINA...

28:42.287 --> 28:44.847
WOULD YOU
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN?

28:45.390 --> 28:47.291
WELL, I THOUGHT
THE TWO OF YOU WERE MAD.

28:47.358 --> 28:49.059
BUT I SAT BACK,
AND I SAID NOTHING,

28:49.127 --> 28:50.494
HOPING IT WOULD WORK.

28:50.595 --> 28:52.635
I DID WHAT I COULD
TO PROTECT AUDRINA.

28:52.697 --> 28:54.998
YOU HEARD WHAT SHE SAID
ABOUT DYING.

28:56.668 --> 28:58.068
MM.

28:58.136 --> 29:00.370
FORBIDDEN LOVE
IS IRRESISTIBLE.

29:00.472 --> 29:01.371
IT CAN BE
ALL-CONSUMING,

29:01.439 --> 29:04.274
NO DIFFERENT THAN MADNESS.

29:04.375 --> 29:05.476
YOU'LL ONLY MAKE HIM

29:05.577 --> 29:06.810
ALL THE MORE
IRRESISTIBLE

29:06.911 --> 29:10.714
IF YOU
DENY HER ACCESS.

29:11.816 --> 29:13.383
I'M AFRAID
YOU'LL LOSE HER ALTOGETHER

29:13.485 --> 29:15.919
IF YOU'RE NOT CAREFUL.

29:34.105 --> 29:38.208
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL,
IT MAKES MY HEART HURT.

29:39.277 --> 29:41.197
THAT'S SUCH
A NICE THING TO SAY.

29:43.348 --> 29:45.649
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

29:48.553 --> 29:49.820
I REALLY LIKE YOU, AUDRINA.

29:57.695 --> 29:58.996
I'M SORRY.

30:00.999 --> 30:01.865
NO, I'M...

30:01.933 --> 30:04.001
I'M SORRY, ARDEN.

30:04.068 --> 30:07.304
DON'T YOU WANT
TO KISS ME?

30:07.405 --> 30:08.138
I DO.

30:08.239 --> 30:09.239
I JUST...

30:12.644 --> 30:16.446
YOU SHOULD DATE NORMAL GIRLS.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.582
I'M...

30:18.683 --> 30:20.117
NOT NORMAL.

30:20.218 --> 30:23.420
I LOVE THAT
YOU'RE DIFFERENT.

30:23.488 --> 30:24.988
PURE AND SWEET
AND KIND

30:25.056 --> 30:26.657
IN A WAY
THAT'S VERY RARE.

30:26.724 --> 30:28.725
VERY PRECIOUS.

30:28.793 --> 30:31.395
DO YOU HONESTLY
BELIEVE THAT?

30:33.164 --> 30:34.698
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

30:34.799 --> 30:35.966
I KNOW YOU,

30:36.067 --> 30:37.987
AND I KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING, YES.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.210
I PROMISE, ARDEN...

30:47.312 --> 30:49.713
WHEN I'M READY,

30:49.814 --> 30:51.281
IT WILL BE YOU.

30:53.751 --> 30:55.118
CAN YOU WAIT?

30:57.322 --> 30:59.156
FOR YOU,
I CAN WAIT A LONG TIME.

30:59.257 --> 31:00.557
HEY,

31:00.625 --> 31:03.360
MAYBE WE COULD GO
FOR ANOTHER DRIVE TOMORROW.

31:03.428 --> 31:05.668
I COULD TAKE YOU INTO TOWN
FOR YOUR PIANO LESSON?

31:06.064 --> 31:07.664
I'D LIKE THAT.

31:17.876 --> 31:18.742
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU.

31:18.843 --> 31:20.010
ARDEN, YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

31:20.078 --> 31:21.178
I'VE GOT PLENTY
OF READING TO DO.

31:21.279 --> 31:22.312
I'VE GOT A PAPER TO WRITE

31:22.413 --> 31:24.915
FOR MY ARCHITECTURAL
DESIGN CLASS.

31:25.016 --> 31:26.149
GO, YOU'LL BE LATE.

31:26.251 --> 31:28.018
I'VE GOT SO MUCH WORK
TO GET THROUGH.

31:28.119 --> 31:29.119
THANKS.

32:39.557 --> 32:42.392
MM...

33:08.586 --> 33:09.953
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
WHAT HAPPENED?

33:10.054 --> 33:11.154
ARDEN, CAN YOU
TAKE ME HOME, PLEASE?

33:11.222 --> 33:12.356
WHAT ABOUT
YOUR PIANO LESSON?

33:12.457 --> 33:13.223
CAN YOU TAKE ME HOME NOW!

33:13.324 --> 33:14.691
OKAY.

33:14.792 --> 33:15.959
OKAY.

33:25.370 --> 33:26.737
STOP THE CAR.

33:26.838 --> 33:27.971
STOP THE CAR.

33:31.809 --> 33:33.443
AUDRINA?

33:33.544 --> 33:34.678
AUDRINA!

33:36.347 --> 33:37.547
AUDRINA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

33:38.649 --> 33:39.950
I DON'T KNOW.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.752
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING,
I DON'T KNOW...

33:41.853 --> 33:42.986
CALM DOWN.

33:43.087 --> 33:44.321
CALM, DOWN,
IT'S OKAY, IT'S OKAY.

33:44.422 --> 33:46.690
IT'S ALL RIGHT, I'M HERE.

33:49.060 --> 33:50.900
I WANT YOU TO KISS ME,
ARDEN.

33:51.262 --> 33:52.329
I DON'T KNOW
IF THAT'S A GOOD IDEA,

33:52.430 --> 33:53.497
AUDRINA...

33:53.598 --> 33:54.398
NO, I WANTED YOU TO
YESTERDAY,

33:54.499 --> 33:57.367
BUT I WAS AFRAID.

34:05.309 --> 34:06.910
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
I'M SORRY.

34:07.011 --> 34:09.545
SORRY, I'M JUST...

34:09.614 --> 34:11.614
YOU'RE TREMBLING,
AUDRINA.

34:11.716 --> 34:12.716
I'M A FREAK!

34:12.784 --> 34:13.850
DON'T SAY THAT.

34:13.951 --> 34:14.985
I AM.

34:15.053 --> 34:17.213
I AM.
I'M NOT NORMAL.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.121
I'M NOT NORMAL.

34:19.190 --> 34:20.524
I'M NOT NORMAL.

34:20.591 --> 34:22.059
I'M NOT NORMAL!

34:22.159 --> 34:23.460
OKAY, THEN.

34:26.197 --> 34:27.264
YOU NEED TO FORGET
ABOUT ME, ARDEN.

34:27.364 --> 34:28.998
NO.

34:30.001 --> 34:32.601
FORGET ABOUT ME.

34:54.292 --> 34:56.726
DID YOU GET A GOOD LOOK
TODAY?

34:56.793 --> 34:58.962
DID YOU ENJOY SPYING
ON ME AND LAMAR?

34:59.063 --> 35:00.597
JUST STOP IT, VERA.

35:00.698 --> 35:02.199
LEAVE ME ALONE.

35:02.300 --> 35:03.900
YOU KNOW,
IT'S WONDERFUL

35:04.001 --> 35:05.836
HAVING ALL THOSE NINE INCHES
STABBING INTO ME.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.938
STOP, I DON'T
WANT TO HEAR IT.

35:08.005 --> 35:09.272
OH, NO, NO, NO,
I WANT YOU TO HEAR MORE.

35:09.373 --> 35:11.007
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.

35:11.075 --> 35:13.410
WHAT WITH YOUR MOTHER DEAD,
SOMEONE HAS TO EDUCATE YOU.

35:13.478 --> 35:14.578
VERA, IF YOU CARE
FOR ME AT ALL,

35:14.679 --> 35:16.346
THEN YOU'LL LEAVE
MY ROOM RIGHT NOW.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.728
HERE.

35:18.783 --> 35:20.650
LEARN SOMETHING.

35:20.751 --> 35:22.352
YOU'D BETTER STUDY UP

35:22.453 --> 35:23.286
IF YOU WANT TO PLEASE
YOUR LOVER BOY.

35:23.387 --> 35:24.621
STOP IT, VERA...

35:24.722 --> 35:26.123
DON'T YOU WANT ARDEN
TO LIKE YOU?

35:26.190 --> 35:27.390
THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT
YOU HAVE TO DO WITH BOYS.

35:27.492 --> 35:29.292
HONESTLY, AUDRINA,

35:29.393 --> 35:31.593
I AM TRYING TO HELP YOU
UNDERSTAND THE WORLD.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.576
AUDRINA?

35:39.937 --> 35:41.872
AUDRINA?

35:41.973 --> 35:43.907
AUDRINA...

35:44.008 --> 35:45.288
WHAT?

35:50.214 --> 35:52.782
WHAT IS THIS FILTH?

36:04.962 --> 36:05.996
VERA.

36:06.097 --> 36:07.998
NO! NO, IT WAS HER!
IT WAS HER!

36:08.099 --> 36:09.199
YOUR SWEET AUDRINA
IS A REAL PERV, PAPA!

36:09.300 --> 36:10.400
YOU ARE DOING THIS!

36:10.501 --> 36:11.935
NO!

36:12.036 --> 36:12.903
THIS IS YOUR DOING.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.171
EAT IT.

36:14.272 --> 36:15.472
- WHAT?
- EAT THEM!

36:15.573 --> 36:17.974
- NO!
- PAPA, DON'T DO THAT TO HER!

36:18.075 --> 36:19.142
- EAT IT!
- PAPA, DON'T!

36:19.243 --> 36:20.343
- STOP IT, PLEASE!
- EAT IT!

36:20.444 --> 36:21.545
PLEASE STOP!

36:24.515 --> 36:25.448
VERA?

36:25.550 --> 36:27.083
MOM...

36:27.185 --> 36:28.465
WHAT DID YOU DO?

36:28.553 --> 36:31.221
YOUR DAUGHTER IS NOT
WELCOME IN MY HOUSE

36:31.289 --> 36:32.889
SO LONG AS SHE IS
ABUSING MINE!

36:32.990 --> 36:34.624
SORRY.
I'M SORRY.

36:34.725 --> 36:37.594
I DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE WOULD DO SUCH A THING.

36:37.695 --> 36:39.396
HOW COULD YOU, VERA?

36:39.497 --> 36:40.764
KNOWING EVERYTHING
YOU KNOW,

36:40.865 --> 36:42.299
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS
TO POOR AUDRINA?

36:42.366 --> 36:45.535
- ANSWER HER!
- APOLOGIZE!

36:45.636 --> 36:46.803
WHAT ABOUT POOR ME?

36:48.072 --> 36:49.005
I SHOULD'VE NEVER LET YOU

36:49.106 --> 36:50.840
RAISE HER IN MY HOUSE!

36:50.942 --> 36:52.375
DAMMIT!

36:55.279 --> 36:56.146
DAMIAN...

36:56.247 --> 36:57.527
DAMIAN!

37:07.225 --> 37:09.059
ARE YOU OKAY?

37:11.195 --> 37:13.530
YOU'VE NO IDEA WHAT GOES ON
IN HERE, LITTLE SISTER.

37:15.566 --> 37:18.086
THE THINGS HE IS
CAPABLE OF DOING.

37:19.537 --> 37:22.138
HE IS A LIAR
THROUGH AND THROUGH,

37:22.240 --> 37:24.674
BUT ONE DAY...

37:24.775 --> 37:26.943
ONE DAY,
ALL OF THE SECRETS OF THIS HOUSE

37:27.044 --> 37:28.144
WILL BE REVEALED,

37:28.246 --> 37:29.913
AND EVERYBODY WHO MADE ME CRY

37:30.014 --> 37:33.917
IS GOING TO CRY 10 TIMES MORE
THAN I EVER DID.

37:47.331 --> 37:48.531
I'M SO SORRY, AUNT ELLSBETH.

37:50.768 --> 37:54.070
I FEEL LIKE SOME WAFFLES
THIS MORNING.

37:57.875 --> 38:00.210
COULD YOU MAKE SOME FOR ME,
PLEASE, ELLSBETH?

38:11.088 --> 38:12.122
VERA'S GONE.

38:13.024 --> 38:14.424
MY DAUGHTER IS GONE.

38:14.492 --> 38:16.993
SHE WENT TO NEW YORK CITY
WITH THAT PIANO TEACHER.

38:18.195 --> 38:20.730
THAT EXPLAINS WHY THE MONEY
IS MISSING FROM MY WALLET.

38:20.798 --> 38:23.633
WOULD SOME KINDNESS
AND A LITTLE LOVE

38:23.734 --> 38:25.468
HAVE BEEN TOO MUCH
TO GIVE HER?

38:26.871 --> 38:28.004
I DID MORE THAN RIGHT
BY THAT GIRL.

38:28.105 --> 38:30.540
I PAID FOR
HER EDUCATION,

38:30.641 --> 38:32.075
SHE NEVER WENT HUNGRY,

38:32.143 --> 38:35.245
AND I PUT A ROOF OVER HER HEAD
FOR 21 YEARS.

38:36.247 --> 38:38.648
ALL OF THOSE BAD THINGS SHE DID
TO GET YOUR ATTENTION.

38:40.351 --> 38:41.351
SHE THOUGHT
YOU WERE HER FATHER.

38:41.452 --> 38:42.532
SHE WAS YOURS, DAMIAN.

38:42.586 --> 38:44.154
THAT'S ENOUGH!

38:44.221 --> 38:46.723
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

38:48.693 --> 38:50.360
AUDRINA, COULD YOU EXCUSE US
FOR A MOMENT?

38:50.428 --> 38:52.862
COULD YOU GO
TO YOUR BEDROOM?

39:04.675 --> 39:06.309
AS I RECALL,

39:06.410 --> 39:09.012
YOU HAD MULTIPLE
SUITORS BACK THEN.

39:09.113 --> 39:11.448
AND WASN'T THAT
EXACTLY AT THE TIME

39:11.515 --> 39:15.385
THAT I WAS ENGAGED
TO YOUR SISTER?

39:21.025 --> 39:22.792
I'M WORRIED ABOUT VERA.

39:22.893 --> 39:23.893
WELL, DON'T BE.

39:23.994 --> 39:25.128
GIRLS LIKE THAT,

39:25.229 --> 39:27.897
THEY ALWAYS FIND A WAY
TO GET THROUGH IT.

39:27.998 --> 39:29.866
I WANT TO BELIEVE YOU.

39:29.967 --> 39:32.535
BUT BELIEVING YOU

39:32.636 --> 39:35.638
HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY WEAKNESS.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.167
MAMA, WHEN I DIE,

40:04.268 --> 40:06.703
WILL I JUST GO IN THERE
WITH THE OTHER AUDRINA?

40:06.771 --> 40:09.131
I DON'T EVEN HAVE
MY OWN LIFE,

40:09.206 --> 40:10.173
WHY SHOULD I HAVE
MY OWN GRAVE?

40:10.241 --> 40:12.208
AUDRINA...

40:14.879 --> 40:16.946
I SAW YOU PASS ON THE ROAD.

40:18.682 --> 40:20.562
I WANTED TO TALK
TO MY MOTHER.

40:21.685 --> 40:22.685
VERA RAN AWAY.

40:22.753 --> 40:24.387
WHAT HAPPENED?

40:24.488 --> 40:28.258
MY FATHER, HE, UM...

40:28.359 --> 40:32.128
HE GETS VERY ANGRY
SOMETIMES.

40:32.196 --> 40:35.565
THAT'S JUST 'CAUSE
HE'S HAD A HARD LIFE.

40:35.666 --> 40:38.968
EVERYTHING HE DOES
IS OUT OF PAIN.

40:39.069 --> 40:40.537
FIRST MY SISTER DIED,

40:40.638 --> 40:42.138
AND THEN MY MOTHER...

40:42.239 --> 40:43.239
AUDRINA...

40:44.608 --> 40:46.943
YOU'VE HAD IT
HARD, TOO.

40:55.619 --> 40:58.154
BUT SOMEDAY,

40:58.255 --> 41:02.025
I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE HAPPY.

41:04.428 --> 41:05.762
I HAVE TO PINCH MYSELF

41:05.830 --> 41:08.731
THAT YOU'D LIKE ME ENOUGH
TO SAY SUCH THINGS.

41:08.833 --> 41:09.933
IT'S MORE THAN LIKE.

41:20.211 --> 41:22.378
I REFUSE TO
TALK ABOUT THIS ANY LONGER.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.246
BUT JUST
BE QUIET ABOUT IT.

41:23.347 --> 41:24.714
BUT IT'S TRUE.

41:24.782 --> 41:25.949
YOU KNOW IT'S TRUE!

41:26.050 --> 41:26.816
YOU NEED
TO SUPPORT YOURSELF.

41:26.917 --> 41:27.984
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND...

41:28.085 --> 41:29.118
THIS IS WHERE I AM,

41:29.186 --> 41:29.953
THIS IS WHERE
I'LL ALWAYS BE.

41:30.054 --> 41:31.221
TO HELL WITH YOU.

41:31.288 --> 41:32.522
I'M SICK OF BEING
YOUR HOUSEKEEPER.

41:32.623 --> 41:34.858
I'M SICK OF BEING
YOUR COOK, YOUR CLEANER,

41:34.959 --> 41:36.493
AND MOST OF ALL,

41:36.594 --> 41:38.834
I'M SICK OF BEING
YOUR NOW-AND-THEN BED PARTNER.

41:44.134 --> 41:45.435
NO, I'VE HAD ENOUGH!

41:46.837 --> 41:47.704
NO, DAMIAN!

41:47.805 --> 41:48.925
NO, STOP, DON'T HIT HER!

41:49.974 --> 41:50.840
AUDRINA...

41:50.941 --> 41:53.343
NO, IT'S PRIVATE.

41:53.444 --> 41:54.477
GET OUT!

41:54.578 --> 41:56.579
GET OUT!

42:01.852 --> 42:03.686
<i>AUDRINA...</i>

42:03.787 --> 42:06.189
<i>AUDRINA...</i>

42:06.257 --> 42:08.391
<i>AUDRINA...</i>

42:08.492 --> 42:09.559
<i>AUDRINA...</i>

42:40.824 --> 42:41.824
OH... OH...

42:42.693 --> 42:45.028
PAPA?

42:45.129 --> 42:46.529
OH!

42:47.565 --> 42:50.366
SOMEONE PLEASE HELP! PLEASE!

42:50.467 --> 42:52.068
PLEASE, SOMEONE HELP!
PLEASE!

42:52.169 --> 42:53.169
OH...

42:57.141 --> 42:59.375
I NEVER
HURT YOUR AUNT PHYSICALLY...

43:00.811 --> 43:05.214
YET I AM TO BLAME
FOR HER DEATH.

43:05.316 --> 43:08.151
THE CORONER RULED IT
AN ACCIDENT,

43:08.252 --> 43:09.819
NOT A SUICIDE.

43:11.889 --> 43:13.849
ALL THE WOMEN IN MY LIFE
LEAVE ME.

43:18.696 --> 43:20.563
PLEASE...

43:20.664 --> 43:22.332
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME.

43:23.500 --> 43:25.268
SWEET AUDRINA.

43:27.204 --> 43:28.371
PLEASE.

43:45.990 --> 43:47.657
AUDRINA?

43:47.725 --> 43:49.559
AUDRINA!

43:50.561 --> 43:52.295
WHERE ARE YOU?

43:53.897 --> 43:54.897
AUDRINA...

43:54.932 --> 43:58.067
WHERE ARE YOU?

44:02.773 --> 44:04.440
AUDRINA?

44:06.143 --> 44:07.844
WHAT'S WRONG, PAPA?

44:09.680 --> 44:10.780
WHERE WERE YOU?

44:10.848 --> 44:12.882
I WAS CALLING YOU
AND CALLING YOU.

44:12.983 --> 44:15.183
I WAS JUST DOING
SOME GROCERY SHOPPING IN TOWN.

44:15.686 --> 44:16.726
YOU WEREN'T IN TOWN.

44:16.787 --> 44:18.988
YOU WENT TO SEE ARDEN.

44:19.089 --> 44:20.129
I SAW HIM, TOO, YES.

44:21.125 --> 44:22.225
WE WERE DOWN BY THE RIVER.

44:22.292 --> 44:23.493
WELL, I NEEDED YOU HERE.

44:23.594 --> 44:24.627
YOU DIDN'T ASK ME.

44:28.565 --> 44:30.800
I'M GOING MARRY ARDEN
ONE DAY, PAPA...

44:30.901 --> 44:32.368
YOU MAY NOT.

44:32.469 --> 44:33.536
YOU DON'T HAVE MY PERMISSION.

44:33.637 --> 44:34.370
AND HE DOESN'T HAVE
MY PERMISSION.

44:34.471 --> 44:35.672
DINNER'S AT 7:00.

44:35.773 --> 44:37.040
- SO YOU MAY NOT MARRY HIM!
- NO, PAPA!

44:37.141 --> 44:38.474
NO! NO!

44:38.575 --> 44:39.442
NO!

44:39.543 --> 44:40.943
NO, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

44:41.045 --> 44:42.045
YES.

44:42.112 --> 44:44.113
NO. NO. STOP!

44:44.214 --> 44:45.214
NO...

44:45.249 --> 44:46.649
NO, PAPA, PLEASE STOP.

44:46.750 --> 44:47.750
NO!

44:49.119 --> 44:51.421
PAPA, PLEASE!

44:51.522 --> 44:53.356
NOT THIS TIME!

44:53.457 --> 44:54.757
NO!

44:55.659 --> 44:56.659
NO!

45:03.901 --> 45:05.468
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

45:13.510 --> 45:15.078
HOW DARE YOU.

45:17.981 --> 45:20.283
AUDRINA!

45:22.953 --> 45:24.287
YOU HAVE NO RIGHT
TO DO THAT!

45:24.388 --> 45:25.488
OPEN THE DOOR!

45:25.589 --> 45:27.290
OPEN THIS DOOR!

45:27.391 --> 45:29.092
AUDRINA!

46:05.562 --> 46:06.696
I WANT TO BE WITH YOU, ARDEN,

46:06.797 --> 46:09.599
AND MAKE A LIFE
WITH YOU.

46:11.702 --> 46:12.702
I...

46:12.803 --> 46:14.070
I MAY NOT
BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU

46:14.171 --> 46:16.452
ALL THE SPLENDOR
YOU'VE GROWN UP WITH...

46:16.807 --> 46:19.127
BUT ALL MY LIFE WILL BE DEVOTED
TO MAKING YOU HAPPY.

46:21.044 --> 46:23.146
LET'S NOT WAIT.

46:23.247 --> 46:24.447
LET'S NOT WAIT ANOTHER DAY.

47:19.469 --> 47:21.037
IT WOULD HAVE
BEEN MY JOY

47:21.138 --> 47:23.406
AND MY PLEASURE

47:23.507 --> 47:25.508
TO WALK YOU DOWN THE AISLE.

47:25.609 --> 47:28.211
I'VE ONLY COME
TO PICK UP SOME THINGS.

47:28.312 --> 47:29.679
CONGRATULATIONS.

47:39.156 --> 47:40.256
YOU...

47:40.357 --> 47:43.526
YOU MARRIED MY DAUGHTER TODAY.

47:48.031 --> 47:49.265
YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.

47:51.034 --> 47:52.535
LET'S ALL, UH..

47:52.636 --> 47:55.238
GO INSIDE, SHALL WE,
AND BE CIVILIZED?

47:55.339 --> 47:57.306
I HAVE AN APPOINTMENT
SHORTLY IN THE CITY

47:57.407 --> 47:59.041
BUT, UM...

47:59.142 --> 48:00.243
THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT'S IMPORTANT

48:00.344 --> 48:01.544
THAT I WANT TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT,

48:01.645 --> 48:04.347
BOTH OF YOU.

48:06.516 --> 48:08.217
HE'S GOT NO POWER
OVER YOU ANYMORE.

48:08.318 --> 48:09.385
WE'RE ONLY
GOING TO BE HERE

48:09.486 --> 48:11.846
FOR A COUPLE
OF MINUTES, OKAY?

48:13.657 --> 48:15.697
YOU'RE PLANNING ON
BEING AN ARCHITECT?

48:16.627 --> 48:18.060
YES.

48:18.128 --> 48:20.596
DAMN HARD BUSINESS
TO BREAK INTO.

48:22.199 --> 48:23.933
I'VE MADE
SOME APPLICATIONS.

48:24.001 --> 48:25.468
I'M WAITING TO HEAR.

48:25.569 --> 48:27.270
YEAH.

48:27.337 --> 48:29.805
A THIRD-RATE JOB
AT A SECOND-RATE FIRM.

48:29.907 --> 48:32.541
WHY NOT ACCEPT THE COMMISSION
TO REDESIGN WHITEFERN?

48:35.379 --> 48:36.279
EXCUSE ME?

48:36.380 --> 48:37.613
YEAH.

48:37.714 --> 48:38.874
IT WOULD BE A GREAT START

48:38.949 --> 48:39.916
FOR AN UP-AND-COMING
YOUNG ARCHITECT.

48:40.017 --> 48:43.085
TO UPDATE THIS...

48:43.186 --> 48:45.254
GRAND OLD DAME.

48:46.356 --> 48:47.823
SHE'S GOT GREAT BONES.

48:49.293 --> 48:50.693
ANY FIRM WOULD KILL
FOR THIS COMMISSION.

48:50.794 --> 48:54.764
LET ARDEN WALK IN THE DOOR
WITH THAT.

48:54.865 --> 48:56.933
I MEAN...

48:57.034 --> 48:58.901
THAT IS KIND.

48:59.002 --> 49:00.436
AND, UM...

49:00.537 --> 49:03.639
YOU KNOW, WHILE THE WORK
WAS BEING DONE,

49:03.740 --> 49:07.543
IT WOULD BE NICE
IF YOU LIVED HERE.

49:09.112 --> 49:10.112
I HATE BEING ALONE.

49:10.213 --> 49:11.314
PAPA...

49:11.381 --> 49:13.783
YOU DESERVE HAPPINESS,
AUDRINA.

49:13.850 --> 49:15.217
THAT'S ALL I'VE EVER WANTED.

49:15.319 --> 49:16.419
WHAT BETTER WAY
THAN TO GIVE YOUR NEW HUSBAND

49:16.486 --> 49:17.386
THE BEST POSSIBLE START
HE COULD HAVE

49:17.487 --> 49:18.821
AS A BUDDING
YOUNG ARCHITECT.

49:18.922 --> 49:20.082
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE, ARDEN?

49:21.658 --> 49:22.892
YUP.

49:24.394 --> 49:26.128
SHE'LL INHERIT
WHITEFERN ONE DAY,

49:26.229 --> 49:28.164
START YOUR FAMILY HERE.

49:28.265 --> 49:29.899
I WANT A...

49:30.000 --> 49:32.735
A CHANCE TO MAKE UP
FOR MY, UH...

49:32.836 --> 49:34.337
PAST MISTAKES.

49:39.609 --> 49:41.010
HERE WE ARE.

49:42.145 --> 49:43.079
ONE, TWO...

49:43.146 --> 49:44.313
THREE.

49:55.792 --> 49:57.593
UM...

49:57.694 --> 49:59.328
THAT'S OKAY,
IT'S OKAY.

50:03.734 --> 50:05.134
UM...

50:07.270 --> 50:09.472
I'M GLAD I KEPT UP
WITH THE DUSTING.

50:12.142 --> 50:13.309
IT'S A LOT NICER
THAN THE CRUMMY MOTEL

50:13.410 --> 50:15.410
I HAD PLANNED
FOR OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

50:20.417 --> 50:23.319
PLEASE BE HAPPY,
AUDRINA.

50:25.255 --> 50:28.557
YOU... YOU KNOW
THAT I'M...

50:28.658 --> 50:31.260
OF COURSE.

50:31.328 --> 50:34.530
YOU THINK I DON'T HAVE
WEDDING NIGHT JITTERS?

50:35.665 --> 50:38.100
I LOVE YOU, AUDRINA.

50:38.201 --> 50:40.302
WE'LL TAKE IT EASY,

50:40.404 --> 50:41.570
GO SLOW.

50:41.671 --> 50:42.705
YOU'LL BE SURPRISED

50:42.806 --> 50:45.541
AT HOW NATURALLY
THINGS COME ABOUT.

50:45.642 --> 50:47.376
OKAY.

50:49.413 --> 50:51.453
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU LOOK
SO BEAUTIFUL.

51:07.064 --> 51:08.697
UH...

51:08.799 --> 51:11.200
HEY, UH, ENOUGH
OF THAT MUSHY STUFF.

51:11.268 --> 51:13.069
LET'S HAVE SOME CHAMPAGNE.

51:14.571 --> 51:15.838
SURE, UM...

51:15.939 --> 51:18.908
OKAY, JUST, UH,
LET ME FRESHEN UP A BIT,

51:19.009 --> 51:20.576
AND I'LL BE OUT
IN A FEW MINUTES.

51:20.677 --> 51:21.944
WHATEVER
YOU WANT, MY LOVE.

51:22.045 --> 51:24.046
OKAY.

51:44.334 --> 51:46.235
EVERYTHING OKAY,
AUDRINA?

51:46.336 --> 51:48.337
YUP, I'M FINE.

51:48.438 --> 51:51.540
JUST, UM, GIVE ME
FIVE MORE MINUTES, OKAY?

51:51.641 --> 51:53.042
OF COURSE, HONEY.

51:53.143 --> 51:54.877
TAKE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE.

51:54.978 --> 51:56.178
OKAY. THANKS.

51:56.279 --> 51:58.747
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

52:45.295 --> 52:47.096
AUDRINA?

52:48.298 --> 52:49.665
AUDRINA!

52:49.733 --> 52:51.100
<i>AUDRINA...</i>

52:51.201 --> 52:52.468
<i>AUDRINA!</i>

52:52.536 --> 52:53.702
AUDRINA!

52:53.803 --> 52:55.437
<i>AUDRINA!</i>

52:55.539 --> 52:57.072
AUDRINA?

52:57.174 --> 52:58.174
AUDRINA!

53:01.311 --> 53:02.845
ARE YOU OKAY,
MY LOVE?

53:02.946 --> 53:05.514
YES, I'M... I'M FINE.

53:05.582 --> 53:06.862
I'M HERE WITH YOU.

53:14.324 --> 53:16.564
I KNOW WHY IT'S SO HARD
FOR YOU TO BE INTIMATE.

53:20.030 --> 53:22.198
I GET VISIONS

53:22.265 --> 53:23.866
OF WHAT HAPPENED TO MY SISTER.

53:23.967 --> 53:25.234
I'D NEVER HURT YOU,
AUDRINA.

53:25.335 --> 53:27.436
NO. I KNOW THAT.

53:27.504 --> 53:28.784
I'VE LOVED YOU SINCE...

53:30.440 --> 53:32.508
SINCE BEFORE I KNEW YOU.

53:33.977 --> 53:35.945
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

53:36.046 --> 53:37.479
YOU KNOW, UM...

53:37.547 --> 53:41.750
THEY SAY TRUE LOVERS
NEVER MEET FOR THE FIRST TIME...

53:42.986 --> 53:45.267
THEY'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
IN THEIR HEARTS ALL ALONG.

53:46.489 --> 53:49.625
THAT'S THE MOST ROMANTIC THING
I'VE EVER HEARD.

53:51.461 --> 53:53.128
AND, UM,

53:53.230 --> 53:54.964
I DO KNOW EXACTLY WHAT YOU MEAN.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.902
BECAUSE I FEEL
THE SAME WAY ABOUT YOU.

54:02.772 --> 54:03.872
WHAT?

54:03.974 --> 54:05.241
NOTHING.

54:26.563 --> 54:28.264
THIS IS OKAY?

54:28.365 --> 54:30.733
YES. IT'S FINE.

54:33.336 --> 54:34.637
IT'S FINE.

54:50.287 --> 54:51.487
NO, STOP, STOP.

54:53.623 --> 54:54.556
IT'S OKAY, AUDRINA.

54:54.658 --> 54:56.759
IT'S OKAY.

54:56.860 --> 54:57.926
I WOULD NEVER MAKE YOU
DO ANYTHING

54:58.028 --> 55:00.262
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO.

55:03.366 --> 55:04.433
I'M SO SORRY, ARDEN.

55:50.413 --> 55:51.453
HAPPY THANKSGIVING.

55:54.617 --> 55:56.577
AREN'T YOU GONNA
INVITE ME IN, SIS?

56:12.936 --> 56:14.870
I SHOULD HAVE COME BACK
FOR MY MOTHER'S FUNERAL,

56:14.971 --> 56:16.004
I KNOW THAT.

56:17.440 --> 56:19.541
BUT I WAS STILL TOO ANGRY.

56:20.710 --> 56:22.478
I HEARD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

56:24.414 --> 56:25.614
YEAH.

56:25.715 --> 56:27.216
WELL, TURNS OUT

56:27.283 --> 56:29.651
LAMAR RENSDALE WAS A COWARD
WHEN THE CHIPS WERE DOWN.

56:31.054 --> 56:32.788
I'M SORRY.

56:33.957 --> 56:36.157
IT TOOK A LOT OF GUTS
FOR ME TO TURN UP HERE.

56:37.193 --> 56:39.153
I WASN'T SURE
I'D BE WELCOME BACK.

56:40.296 --> 56:41.997
WELL, PAPA'S NOT AS ANGRY
AS HE USED TO BE.

56:42.065 --> 56:44.833
I WASN'T TALKING ABOUT DAMIAN.

56:44.901 --> 56:46.502
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU.

56:48.471 --> 56:49.972
YOU KNOW, DESPITE ALL THAT
WE WENT THROUGH

56:50.073 --> 56:52.841
GROWING UP IN THIS MADHOUSE,

56:52.909 --> 56:54.076
YOU HATED ME.

56:56.346 --> 56:57.679
WHEN ALL I EVER WANTED
WAS TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

56:57.747 --> 57:00.349
BUT THAT'S ALL I EVER WANTED.

57:00.417 --> 57:01.550
IT WAS YOU WHO HATED ME.

57:01.618 --> 57:02.818
IS THAT HOW YOU REMEMBER IT?

57:05.422 --> 57:06.488
LOOK,

57:06.589 --> 57:09.057
WHO REALLY KNOWS
IF WE ARE SISTERS

57:09.159 --> 57:10.159
OR COUSINS,

57:10.193 --> 57:11.693
BUT LET'S AT LEAST BE FRIENDS?

57:13.196 --> 57:14.229
START AFRESH?

57:24.808 --> 57:25.741
PLEASE, GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

57:25.842 --> 57:26.975
YOU'RE NOT WELCOME HERE.

57:27.043 --> 57:28.177
PAPA, YOU SAID
YOU WANTED A CHANCE

57:28.278 --> 57:29.778
TO MAKE UP FOR
YOUR PAST MISTAKES.

57:29.846 --> 57:32.781
NOW, YOU SHOULD AGREE
THAT VERA SHOULD HAVE ONE, TOO.

57:32.882 --> 57:34.249
SHE'S HAD A REALLY
TOUGH TIME

57:34.350 --> 57:35.317
SINCE SHE LEFT WHITEFERN.

57:35.385 --> 57:36.385
EVERY BAD BREAK

57:36.486 --> 57:37.386
SHE'S BROUGHT
UPON HERSELF.

57:37.487 --> 57:38.720
NONETHELESS, SHE'S FAMILY,

57:38.788 --> 57:41.457
COUSIN OR SISTER,
DAUGHTER OR NIECE...

57:41.558 --> 57:43.392
NOW, SHE'LL BE STAYING WITH US
FOR A FEW DAYS

57:43.493 --> 57:44.693
SO SHE CAN VISIT
HER MOTHER'S GRAVE,

57:44.794 --> 57:47.830
AND GO THROUGH
SOME OF ELLSBETH'S THINGS.

57:47.931 --> 57:49.011
I'VE MADE UP MY MIND.

58:00.577 --> 58:02.177
I APPRECIATE YOU
LETTING ME STAY

58:02.278 --> 58:03.078
FOR THANKSGIVING.

58:03.179 --> 58:04.446
AH, MM...

58:04.547 --> 58:07.249
WE ALL DESERVE
SECOND CHANCES.

58:09.786 --> 58:10.919
WOW, AUDRINA,

58:11.020 --> 58:12.087
THIS IS AMAZING.

58:12.188 --> 58:14.068
DID YOU DO THIS
ALL YOURSELF?

58:14.858 --> 58:16.758
AUDRINA'S REALLY TURNED INTO
A WONDERFUL COOK.

58:16.826 --> 58:17.693
SHE TAKES CARE OF US
BEAUTIFULLY

58:17.794 --> 58:19.161
EVERY DAY.

58:19.262 --> 58:20.195
IT'S REALLY
DELICIOUS, MY LOVE.

58:20.263 --> 58:21.363
YOU OUTDID YOURSELF.

58:21.464 --> 58:22.464
IT MUST BE SO HARD,

58:22.532 --> 58:23.692
TAKING CARE OF THESE TWO.

58:24.400 --> 58:26.034
I LIKE COOKING.

58:26.135 --> 58:27.202
AND ALL THE HOUSEWORK?

58:27.303 --> 58:28.871
I MEAN, THIS PLACE
IS MASSIVE.

58:28.972 --> 58:30.706
BUT HEY, IF I STICK AROUND,
I COULD PITCH IN.

58:30.807 --> 58:32.207
LORD KNOWS

58:32.308 --> 58:34.910
MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME
A THING OR TWO ABOUT HOUSEWORK.

58:34.978 --> 58:36.278
POOR WOMAN.

58:39.315 --> 58:40.349
I'D LIKE TO RAISE A TOAST.

58:40.450 --> 58:42.251
TO AUDRINA
AND ARDEN,

58:42.352 --> 58:44.286
THE HAPPY COUPLE.

58:44.387 --> 58:46.121
THANK YOU.

58:47.156 --> 58:48.056
TO YOU.

58:48.157 --> 58:49.591
THANK YOU.

58:49.692 --> 58:51.393
NOW, WHEN ARE YOU TWO GOING TO
START MAKING BABIES

58:51.494 --> 58:53.534
TO FILL THIS PLACE
WITH LAUGHTER, HUH?

58:56.833 --> 58:59.067
WELL, ALL IN GOOD TIME.

59:04.440 --> 59:05.974
YOU KNOW, I THINK

59:06.075 --> 59:07.910
THERE'S SOMETHING DEEPLY EROTIC
ABOUT BABIES.

59:10.713 --> 59:13.148
THAT'S A PECULIAR THING
TO SAY, VERA.

59:14.417 --> 59:15.817
PERHAPS
YOU SHOULDN'T SAY ANY MORE.

59:15.885 --> 59:19.087
THEY SUCK ON YOUR BOOBS
ALL DAY LONG.

59:19.155 --> 59:21.290
IF THAT'S NOT EROTIC,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS.

59:21.391 --> 59:22.558
THAT'S ENOUGH.

59:45.248 --> 59:48.517
SO, LOOK AT YOU,
TAKING ON WHITEFERN.

59:48.618 --> 59:49.918
SUCH A BIG JOB.

59:50.019 --> 59:53.322
DAMIAN HAS GIVEN YOU
A GARGANTUAN TASK.

59:53.423 --> 59:56.491
IT HAS BEEN
A CHALLENGING ASSIGNMENT.

59:56.559 --> 59:57.659
I CAN'T IMAGINE

59:57.760 --> 59:59.200
HOW MUCH PRESSURE
YOU MUST BE UNDER.

59:59.262 --> 01:00:00.028
IS IT AWFULLY HARD?

01:00:00.129 --> 01:00:01.563
IT'S A LOT,

01:00:01.664 --> 01:00:03.231
SOMETIMES TOO MUCH.

01:00:03.299 --> 01:00:05.200
FEELS LIKE EVERY RENOVATION PLAN
I COME UP WITH

01:00:05.301 --> 01:00:07.336
REVEALS ANOTHER DESIGN FLAW

01:00:07.403 --> 01:00:09.523
THAT I'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO FIX.

01:00:10.373 --> 01:00:12.741
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT JUST
TALKING ABOUT WHITEFERN,

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:15.410
BUT MAYBE
SOMEONE LIVING IN IT?

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:17.913
IT CAN'T BE EASY
BEING MARRIED

01:00:17.981 --> 01:00:19.848
TO SOMEONE SO...

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:27.322
AUDRINA IS WONDERFUL,

01:00:27.423 --> 01:00:30.559
AND SO, SO BEAUTIFUL,

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:34.162
BUT DON'T TELL ME
SHE ISN'T FLAWED.

01:00:34.263 --> 01:00:36.598
DEEPLY, DEEPLY SCARRED

01:00:36.666 --> 01:00:40.435
BY WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE FIRST AUDRINA.

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:42.604
I THINK YOU'RE A HERO
FOR TAKING IT ALL ON.

01:00:42.705 --> 01:00:44.473
I'M NOT A HERO.

01:00:44.574 --> 01:00:45.907
I'M THE OPPOSITE OF A HERO.

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:47.275
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:48.443
I DON'T WANT TO DISCUSS IT.

01:00:48.544 --> 01:00:50.479
OKAY.

01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:51.813
HAVE IT YOUR WAY.

01:00:53.349 --> 01:00:55.117
BUT IN MY EYES,
YOU'RE A HERO,

01:00:55.218 --> 01:00:57.986
AND A VERY HANDSOME ONE.

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:03.945
I'VE GOT TO CALL
THE CONTRACTOR.

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:30.050
IT'S JUST LIKE
OLD TIMES.

01:01:31.254 --> 01:01:32.254
WHAT?

01:01:35.124 --> 01:01:37.726
WELL, THAT'S THE BEST
DARNED PICKLE I EVER TASTED.

01:01:43.232 --> 01:01:45.133
I GUESS YOU HAVEN'T GROWN UP
VERY MUCH.

01:01:45.201 --> 01:01:47.235
SORRY,
MISS MATURE MARRIED LADY.

01:01:49.472 --> 01:01:52.107
SO, GO ON, TELL ME,
WHAT'S ARDEN LIKE IN BED?

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:54.109
IS HE A TOTAL
HOT ROD?

01:01:54.177 --> 01:01:55.177
VERA...

01:01:55.244 --> 01:01:56.378
OH, NO,

01:01:56.479 --> 01:01:57.345
YOU HAVE A LIMP NOODLE,

01:01:57.447 --> 01:01:58.413
DON'T YOU?

01:01:58.514 --> 01:01:59.448
POOR YOU.

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:01.483
IT'S NOTHING
LIKE THAT.

01:02:01.584 --> 01:02:03.018
WELL, WHAT'S HIS PROBLEM?

01:02:03.119 --> 01:02:04.286
I BET I CAN
HELP YOU FIX IT.

01:02:04.387 --> 01:02:05.887
WHOA.

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:13.161
THE PROBLEM ISN'T HIS.

01:02:13.229 --> 01:02:15.630
IT'S MINE.

01:02:15.732 --> 01:02:18.266
YOU WANT SOME TIPS?

01:02:20.970 --> 01:02:23.238
LOOK, AUDRINA,
SEX IS WONDERFUL.

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:24.372
IT'S SO FUN,

01:02:24.474 --> 01:02:26.308
SO FREEING,

01:02:26.375 --> 01:02:28.935
AND THE PHYSICAL
PLEASURE, IT...

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:32.581
OKAY...

01:02:32.648 --> 01:02:34.049
SO WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU TWO DID IT?

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:36.451
NONE OF YOUR DAMNED BUSINESS.

01:02:56.939 --> 01:02:58.774
YOU LOOK TIRED.

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:00.641
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE
SUCH A RESTLESS SLEEPER.

01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:02.477
I CAN'T CATCH A WINK.

01:03:02.545 --> 01:03:04.713
WELL, YES.

01:03:04.814 --> 01:03:06.615
AND YOU SNORE.

01:03:06.716 --> 01:03:08.150
I DO NOT.

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:09.951
YEAH, YOU DO.

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:11.653
I DO NOT.

01:03:11.754 --> 01:03:13.188
YOU DO.

01:03:13.289 --> 01:03:15.557
I DO NOT.

01:03:15.658 --> 01:03:16.792
YEAH, YOU DO.

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:19.060
I DO NOT.

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:31.573
IT'S OKAY.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.408
IT HURTS, IT HURTS.

01:03:33.476 --> 01:03:34.943
STOP! STOP...

01:03:35.011 --> 01:03:36.545
IT'S ALL RIGHT,
IT'S OKAY.

01:03:36.646 --> 01:03:38.113
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.851
ALL RIGHT,
COME ALONG SLOWLY.

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:43.952
THERE YOU GO.

01:03:44.053 --> 01:03:45.053
EASY, TAKE IT EASY.

01:03:45.154 --> 01:03:46.521
IT HURTS.

01:03:46.622 --> 01:03:47.622
OKAY...

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:49.938
HERE YOU GO.

01:03:54.130 --> 01:03:55.597
THANK YOU.

01:03:58.668 --> 01:04:01.303
UM, I'M SUPPOSED TO
KEEP MY LEG ELEVATED.

01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:03.071
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD
PUT A PILLOW UNDER IT?

01:04:03.172 --> 01:04:04.452
YEAH, SURE.

01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:09.678
THANK YOU.

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.350
CAN I GET YOU
ANYTHING ELSE?

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:18.353
COULD YOU MAYBE GET ME
A CUP OF HERBAL TEA?

01:04:18.454 --> 01:04:20.121
OF COURSE.

01:04:20.156 --> 01:04:21.723
THANK YOU.

01:04:22.725 --> 01:04:24.893
AUDRINA, COULD YOU
RUN TO TOWN

01:04:24.994 --> 01:04:27.229
AND GET MY PAIN
PRESCRIPTION FILLED?

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:28.964
I'M JUST IN SO,
SO MUCH PAIN.

01:04:29.031 --> 01:04:30.532
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE
REALLY SHOULD HAVE THROWN AWAY

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.734
THAT DECREPIT OLD STOOL,
DON'T YOU THINK?

01:04:38.274 --> 01:04:41.009
I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE
DONE IT ON PURPOSE.

01:04:41.110 --> 01:04:42.944
BROKE HER LEG?

01:04:43.012 --> 01:04:45.280
COME ON, AUDRINA,
THAT'S SO UNGENEROUS OF YOU.

01:04:45.381 --> 01:04:47.749
NO ONE'S THAT SICK.

01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:07.641
POUR ME ONE OF THOSE,
WILL YA?

01:05:16.245 --> 01:05:17.279
I THOUGHT
YOU AND AUDRINA

01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:19.820
HAD GONE UP
FOR THE NIGHT.

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:22.751
YOU'RE SO TENSE.

01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:25.720
IT MUST BE VERY,
VERY FRUSTRATING

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:29.424
NOT TO BE ABLE TO SLEEP
WITH YOUR OWN WIFE.

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:32.127
ISN'T IT?

01:06:05.628 --> 01:06:07.909
MY LOVE...

01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:11.900
WOULD YOU LIKE
A GLASS OF WINE, AUDRINA?

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:24.946
HEY...

01:06:26.482 --> 01:06:29.417
HEY... LISTEN, THAT WAS...

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:32.354
THAT WAS NOTHING, OKAY?

01:06:32.455 --> 01:06:33.321
LISTEN TO ME.

01:06:33.389 --> 01:06:35.890
I'M RELEASING YOU, ARDEN.

01:06:35.958 --> 01:06:38.827
I'M LETTING YOU GO.

01:06:38.894 --> 01:06:42.297
EXCUSE ME?

01:06:42.365 --> 01:06:43.732
YOU SHOULD BE
WITH SOMEONE

01:06:43.833 --> 01:06:45.433
WHO CAN SHARE
THEMSELVES IN EVERY WAY

01:06:45.501 --> 01:06:47.569
A HUSBAND AND WIFE
SHOULD EXPERIENCE LOVE.

01:06:47.670 --> 01:06:50.238
YOU DESERVE TO BE HAPPY.

01:06:52.475 --> 01:06:56.244
I CAN'T GIVE YOU
WHAT YOU WANT, ARDEN,

01:06:56.312 --> 01:06:57.479
SO WHY SHOULDN'T YOU GET IT

01:06:57.546 --> 01:07:00.248
FROM SOMEONE
WHO'S OFFERING IT UP?

01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:01.583
ARE YOU SERIOUS RIGHT NOW?

01:07:03.586 --> 01:07:05.653
YES, I AM.

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:08.036
DON'T YOU
LOVE ME ANYMORE?

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:11.292
STOP BEING SO NICE
TO ME!

01:07:12.294 --> 01:07:13.862
STOP BEING SO PATIENT!

01:07:13.963 --> 01:07:15.730
ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE
FORCED THINGS BY NOW,

01:07:15.831 --> 01:07:17.111
OR LEFT ME, AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:19.467
I'M A FRIGID FREAK!

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:20.268
DON'T SAY THAT.

01:07:20.369 --> 01:07:21.403
JUST...

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:23.671
WHY DO YOU
STAY WITH ME, THEN?

01:07:23.773 --> 01:07:25.407
WHY DID YOU MARRY ME
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:29.711
SOME WEIRD SHUT-AWAY GIRL
YOU HARDLY EVEN KNEW.

01:07:29.779 --> 01:07:32.247
WHAT ON EARTH
DID YOU SEE IN ME?

01:07:32.348 --> 01:07:33.348
I FELT A BOND.

01:07:35.484 --> 01:07:36.484
I FEEL BOUND TO YOU.

01:07:36.585 --> 01:07:38.353
WHY?

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:39.754
WHAT BOND?

01:07:41.924 --> 01:07:44.426
IF I TELL YOU,
YOU WOULDN'T LOVE ME ANYMORE.

01:07:45.394 --> 01:07:46.434
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN LIKE ME.

01:07:54.603 --> 01:07:56.871
IS THIS TO DO
WITH THE FIRST AUDRINA?

01:07:59.475 --> 01:08:01.676
IS IT TO DO
WITH WHAT HAPPENED TO HER?

01:08:04.180 --> 01:08:06.047
YES.

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:12.053
OH, GOD.

01:08:14.423 --> 01:08:17.292
OH, GOD...

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:18.827
WERE YOU ONE OF THOSE BOYS?

01:08:18.928 --> 01:08:19.727
NO, I WASN'T!

01:08:19.795 --> 01:08:20.962
AUDRINA, NO. I WASN'T.

01:08:21.063 --> 01:08:21.863
OH, MY GOD!

01:08:21.930 --> 01:08:22.964
AUDRINA, STOP.

01:08:23.064 --> 01:08:24.165
LOOK, I KNEW HER.

01:08:25.401 --> 01:08:27.935
I KNEW
THE FIRST AUDRINA.

01:08:30.005 --> 01:08:31.538
I WAS IN THE WOODS ON THAT DAY.

01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:32.841
I SAW THEM
CHASING HER.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:34.408
I TRIED TO STOP IT,

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:35.844
BUT THEY WERE
OLDER THAN ME,

01:08:35.944 --> 01:08:37.377
MUCH BIGGER, AND THERE
WERE THREE OF THEM.

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:39.214
I TRIED TO HELP HER,
BUT I WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH.

01:08:39.314 --> 01:08:40.314
I...

01:08:43.385 --> 01:08:44.285
I'M SORRY.

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:45.687
SO, WHAT, ARE YOU...

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:46.955
ARE YOU ATTRACTED TO ME

01:08:47.055 --> 01:08:48.656
OUT OF SOME TWISTED
SENSE OF GUILT?

01:08:48.756 --> 01:08:50.325
SOME SICK TIE

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:52.026
TO THE FIRST AUDRINA?

01:08:52.127 --> 01:08:53.995
THERE IS SO MUCH MORE TO THIS

01:08:54.095 --> 01:08:57.899
THAN I CAN
OR HAVE A RIGHT TO TELL.

01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.560
HOW COULD YOU
KEEP THIS FROM ME?

01:09:00.469 --> 01:09:01.549
I'M SORRY.

01:09:13.048 --> 01:09:14.482
WHAT?

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:17.118
WHAT IS IT
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL ME?

01:09:20.488 --> 01:09:22.756
PLEASE,
I CAN'T TAKE IT ANYMORE.

01:09:22.858 --> 01:09:24.225
PLEASE...

01:09:28.796 --> 01:09:30.064
DAMIAN...

01:09:30.166 --> 01:09:31.332
YOU'VE GOT TO TELL HER THE TRUTH
RIGHT NOW.

01:09:31.433 --> 01:09:33.353
- WHAT...
- IT'S GONE ON TOO LONG.

01:09:33.402 --> 01:09:34.602
IF YOU DON'T TELL HER,
I WILL.

01:09:34.670 --> 01:09:35.937
NOW, DAMIAN.

01:09:36.037 --> 01:09:37.404
DAMIAN, NOW!

01:09:58.661 --> 01:10:00.061
AUDRINA!

01:10:00.162 --> 01:10:01.396
AUDRINA!

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:02.617
COME AWAY FROM THE EDGE.

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:04.966
STOP!

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:07.154
TELL ME THE TRUTH
ABOUT THE FIRST AUDRINA.

01:10:08.637 --> 01:10:10.038
TELL ME.

01:10:13.909 --> 01:10:15.476
<i>THEY COULD HAVE
GONE TO THE POLICE,</i>

01:10:15.544 --> 01:10:17.011
<i>BUT LUCIETTA</i>

01:10:17.079 --> 01:10:18.213
<i>DIDN'T WANT HER DAUGHTER
HUMILIATED.</i>

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:19.881
<i>IT WAS DEGRADATION</i>

01:10:19.949 --> 01:10:21.649
<i>THAT YOUR MOTHER
WAS TRYING TO REMOVE.</i>

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:30.825
<i>SHE... SHE WANTED TO DIE,</i>

01:10:30.926 --> 01:10:32.026
<i>AND SHE TRIED...</i>

01:10:32.094 --> 01:10:34.395
<i>SHE TRIED.</i>

01:10:34.463 --> 01:10:35.897
<i>I COULDN'T LET HER DIE.</i>

01:10:35.998 --> 01:10:37.532
SO...

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:40.134
I SAVED HER.

01:10:40.202 --> 01:10:41.369
I SAVED HER
THE ONLY WAY I KNEW HOW.

01:10:41.437 --> 01:10:44.672
WHAT DID YOU DO, PAPA?

01:10:46.575 --> 01:10:48.343
<i>THE PSYCHIATRIST SAID
SHOCK THERAPY</i>

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:49.978
<i>WAS THE ONLY THING
THAT WOULD WORK.</i>

01:10:50.045 --> 01:10:51.179
<i>I WOULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING</i>

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:52.580
<i>TO REMOVE THAT DAY
IN THE WOODS</i>

01:10:52.681 --> 01:10:54.382
<i>FROM MY LITTLE GIRL'S
MEMORY.</i>

01:10:54.450 --> 01:10:57.619
<i>DAY AFTER DAY,
OVER AND OVER, I TOLD HER,</i>

01:10:57.686 --> 01:10:59.621
<i>IT WASN'T HER,
THAT IT WAS HER OLDER SISTER,</i>

01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:01.389
<i>THAT THEY'D KILLED
THE FIRST AUDRINA,</i>

01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:02.523
<i>AND LEFT HER IN THE WOODS.</i>

01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:04.525
BUT THE FIRST AUDRINA IS DEAD.

01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:05.927
NO, SHE'S NOT.

01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:09.397
BECAUSE YOU'RE ALIVE.

01:11:09.465 --> 01:11:10.932
SHE'S BURIED
IN THE FAMILY CEMETERY.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.100
WE WENT THERE EVERY SUNDAY...

01:11:12.167 --> 01:11:13.301
THERE IS NO
FIRST AUDRINA,

01:11:13.369 --> 01:11:15.803
YOU ARE MY ONE AND ONLY AUDRINA.

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.372
WHAT?

01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:24.345
LET GO OF ME.

01:11:25.281 --> 01:11:26.080
AUDRINA, STOP!

01:11:59.114 --> 01:12:00.748
NO, STOP.

01:12:00.849 --> 01:12:01.683
GET AWAY FROM ME.

01:12:01.784 --> 01:12:02.817
I BEG YOU, STOP.

01:12:02.885 --> 01:12:04.218
DON'T TOUCH ME!

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:05.553
STOP, I BEG YOU.
I'M SORRY!

01:12:05.621 --> 01:12:06.654
I'M SORRY!

01:12:06.755 --> 01:12:09.190
NO! DON'T TOUCH ME!

01:12:09.291 --> 01:12:10.958
STOP.

01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.460
I'VE ALWAYS LOVED YOU,
SINCE WE WERE KIDS.

01:12:12.528 --> 01:12:13.961
YOU WERE
RIPPED AWAY FROM ME.

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:15.496
EVERYBODY HAD TO KEEP UP
THE CHARADE TO PROTECT YOU.

01:12:15.564 --> 01:12:17.165
I VOWED NEVER
TO LEAVE YOU ALONE AGAIN,

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:18.466
NEVER TO LET YOU SUFFER!

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:20.268
I TOLD MY MOTHER
TO MOVE US TO THE COTTAGE

01:12:20.369 --> 01:12:21.602
SO I COULD BE
CLOSE TO YOU.

01:12:21.704 --> 01:12:23.004
I LOVE YOU,

01:12:23.072 --> 01:12:25.506
I HAVE ALWAYS, ALWAYS
LOVED YOU, SWEET AUDRINA.

01:14:35.604 --> 01:14:38.840
<i>AUDRINA...</i>

01:14:41.076 --> 01:14:44.812
<i>AUDRINA...</i>

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:50.151
ARDEN, DID YOU HEAR THAT?

01:14:56.658 --> 01:14:59.861
IS MY HEAD
EVER GOING TO BE NORMAL?

01:15:05.300 --> 01:15:08.169
OKAY, I'VE HAD
ENOUGH OF THIS.

01:16:16.405 --> 01:16:19.840
PLEASE WAKE UP
AND COME BACK TO ME.

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:22.343
START OVER.

01:16:22.444 --> 01:16:25.279
I'M SO SORRY.

01:17:02.918 --> 01:17:03.985
THANK YOU.

01:17:06.154 --> 01:17:08.234
THANK YOU
FOR LETTING ME STAY AND HELP.

01:17:11.860 --> 01:17:13.995
DAMIAN...

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:16.731
YOU DID EVERYTHING
YOU EVER COULD FOR AUDRINA,

01:17:16.798 --> 01:17:20.935
EXCEPT FOR ONE THING...

01:17:21.003 --> 01:17:24.405
YOU NEVER LET HER GO.

01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:52.767
YOU NEED
TO GET SOME REST.

01:17:56.805 --> 01:17:58.673
STOP.

01:18:01.943 --> 01:18:04.578
YOU HAVEN'T RESTED
IN DAYS.

01:18:06.515 --> 01:18:08.449
TEA?

01:18:08.517 --> 01:18:11.419
I KNOW YOU LIKE IT SWEET.

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:31.105
YOU NEED TO STAY HYDRATED.

01:19:07.242 --> 01:19:09.143
SLEEP WELL, HANDSOME.

01:19:33.301 --> 01:19:37.037
YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN
THE LOOK IN YOUR EYES

01:19:37.105 --> 01:19:38.606
RIGHT BEFORE
YOU HIT THE FLOOR.

01:19:38.673 --> 01:19:41.776
IT WAS THE EXACT
SAME LOOK

01:19:41.843 --> 01:19:43.577
THAT MY MOTHER HAD.

01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:46.614
DIDN'T I SWEAR REVENGE

01:19:46.681 --> 01:19:49.416
ON ALL THOSE
WHO MADE ME CRY, AUDRINA?

01:19:50.585 --> 01:19:53.254
YOU KNOW, I PRAY THAT
YOU CAN HEAR ME RIGHT NOW,

01:19:53.355 --> 01:19:54.688
AND THAT
YOU CAN REMEMBER

01:19:54.756 --> 01:19:56.157
THE VERY SPECIAL
BIRTHDAY PRESENT

01:19:56.224 --> 01:19:58.425
THAT I GAVE TO YOU.

01:19:58.527 --> 01:19:59.827
<i>SWEET AUDRINA...</i>

01:19:59.928 --> 01:20:01.495
OUCH! STOP THAT.

01:20:01.563 --> 01:20:03.230
AND STOP SAYING
MY NAME LIKE THAT.

01:20:03.331 --> 01:20:04.732
YOU KNOW I DON'T LIKE IT.

01:20:04.800 --> 01:20:06.200
I'M SORRY.

01:20:06.301 --> 01:20:07.668
AUD-REE-NA.

01:20:10.238 --> 01:20:11.872
HERE'S YOUR LOVELY
BIRTHDAY DRESS.

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:14.842
LET ME HELP.

01:20:22.984 --> 01:20:24.285
OH.

01:20:24.352 --> 01:20:26.854
DON'T YOU
LOOK A PICTURE.

01:20:26.922 --> 01:20:29.223
WELL, YOU'RE GOING TO GET
A BIG, BIG SURPRISE

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:31.091
ON YOUR WAY HOME
FROM SCHOOL TODAY.

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:32.459
BUT DON'T YOU WORRY,

01:20:32.527 --> 01:20:34.328
I'VE GOT IT ALL
PERFECTLY PLANNED.

01:20:34.429 --> 01:20:36.564
YOU'LL LOVE IT.

01:20:36.665 --> 01:20:40.067
AUD-REE-NA...

01:20:45.173 --> 01:20:49.276
GOODBYE, SWEET AUDRINA.

01:20:51.513 --> 01:20:53.380
SWEET DREAMS.

01:21:33.421 --> 01:21:35.322
AUDRINA...

01:21:51.273 --> 01:21:52.706
<i>AUDRINA!</i>

01:21:57.279 --> 01:21:59.780
<i>ARDEN!</i>

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:02.616
<i>GET OFF OF HER!</i>

01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:05.386
<i>AUDRINA!</i>

01:22:11.826 --> 01:22:12.927
<i>ARDEN!</i>

01:22:13.028 --> 01:22:14.094
<i>AUDRINA!</i>

01:22:38.687 --> 01:22:39.967
AUDRINA...

01:22:40.889 --> 01:22:42.222
AUDRINA.

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:43.324
AUDRINA!

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:44.558
AUDRINA...

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:45.893
ARDEN. ARDEN!

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:47.528
ARDEN, COME QUICKLY!

01:22:50.198 --> 01:22:51.478
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:22:55.537 --> 01:22:56.437
AUDRINA...

01:22:57.939 --> 01:22:59.039
ARDEN!

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:00.341
AUDRINA!

01:23:05.113 --> 01:23:06.547
WHAT? NO!

01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:09.650
YOU PUSHED ME.

01:23:10.952 --> 01:23:11.952
NO, I DIDN'T.

01:23:12.020 --> 01:23:13.153
YES, YOU DID.

01:23:13.254 --> 01:23:14.488
NO, I DIDN'T.

01:23:14.589 --> 01:23:16.090
YOU PLANNED THE WHOLE THING.

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:17.091
YOU WERE IN THE WOODS.

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:18.192
NO...

01:23:18.293 --> 01:23:19.093
IT WAS YOU.

01:23:19.194 --> 01:23:20.127
IT WASN'T MY FAULT.

01:23:20.228 --> 01:23:21.996
IT'S NOT
MY FAULT, OKAY?

01:23:22.097 --> 01:23:23.797
ALL I EVER WANTED
WAS FOR YOU TO LOVE ME,

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:25.766
BUT YOU NEVER
GAVE ME A CHANCE!

01:23:25.867 --> 01:23:27.601
YOU NEVER GAVE ME A HUG,
YOU NEVER GAVE ME A SMILE,

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:29.036
YOU NEVER
GAVE ME ANYTHING!

01:23:29.137 --> 01:23:30.004
NOTHING!

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:31.372
YOU PLANNED IT?

01:23:31.473 --> 01:23:33.107
I THOUGHT MAYBE
IF AUDRINA WASN'T PERFECT...

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:35.342
YOU BROUGHT
THOSE BOYS TO THE WOODS

01:23:35.443 --> 01:23:36.977
TO TRY TO DESTROY HER?

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:38.512
NOTICE ME,
THAT YOU MIGHT WANT ME TOO...

01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:40.547
SHUT UP! MAY YOUR SOUL ROT
IN EVERLASTING HELL.

01:23:40.648 --> 01:23:41.548
YOU!

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:42.850
NO! NO, NO!

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:44.551
NO, NO, NO,
IT WASN'T ME!

01:23:44.652 --> 01:23:46.532
OH, MY GOD...
NO! IT WAS HER.

01:23:47.322 --> 01:23:48.856
NO. NO!

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:50.557
NO...

01:24:33.935 --> 01:24:38.572
REST WELL, UNHAPPY SOUL.

01:24:51.719 --> 01:24:54.188
<i>AND SO I VOWED</i>
<i>TO BURY MY GRIEF</i>,

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:56.523
<i>LEAVING IT TO ROT,</i>

<i>CHOOSING HOPE,</i>

01:25:04.899 --> 01:25:06.900
<i>CHOOSING LOVE.</i>
