00:12.712 --> 00:15.648
Hello, I'm Jimmy Carr
and welcome to Drunk History,

00:15.648 --> 00:18.251
the show that brings you
genuine stories...

00:18.251 --> 00:21.488
"You've been staying bad stuff."
"Actually, I haven't."

00:21.488 --> 00:22.555
(laughs)

00:22.555 --> 00:24.991
...as told by blind drunk comedians.

00:24.991 --> 00:27.394
The way they partied is
they just did that.

00:27.394 --> 00:30.830
We've mined the depths of time
for our historical tales.

00:30.830 --> 00:32.598
They bop down there.

00:32.598 --> 00:36.469
But we're not going back
to the Jurassic, just the paralytic.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.004
Whoa!

00:38.004 --> 00:39.439
"Oh, for fuck's sake."

00:39.439 --> 00:42.709
I'll just hold a match
really close to this fuse.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.877
(laughs)

00:43.877 --> 00:47.213
Don't use that. You're gonna have
to use that, aren't you?

00:58.158 --> 01:01.694
We start the show with a story
from the Swinging Sixties.

01:01.694 --> 01:05.265
The Beatles were on the radio,
Harold Wilson was in Number Ten

01:05.265 --> 01:08.968
and your nana was in a mini-skirt,
fucking anything in trousers.

01:10.470 --> 01:11.838
(whoops)

01:11.838 --> 01:14.307
After sinking four glasses
of Prosecco,

01:14.307 --> 01:16.743
a bottle of champagne
and a shot of sambuca,

01:16.743 --> 01:19.012
here's a delightfully drunk
Joe Lycett

01:19.012 --> 01:20.747
to tell us about the Kray twins.

01:20.747 --> 01:22.048
God, that's dog shit.

01:23.316 --> 01:28.154
Hello. I'm going to tell you a story
about how one man brought down

01:28.154 --> 01:34.227
two of arguably the worst criminals
in English history, the Kray twins.

01:34.227 --> 01:36.196
Are you sitting comfortably?

01:36.196 --> 01:38.565
Well, then I'll begin.

01:40.266 --> 01:44.103
It's 1964.
It's the Swinging Sixties.

01:44.103 --> 01:45.572
It's a new era of,

01:45.572 --> 01:49.676
"Hey, I'm going to go over here
and I'm going to do some gay things."

01:49.676 --> 01:51.311
"What? That's not allowed."

01:51.311 --> 01:56.049
"No, it's the Sixties. I'm going to
wank off an old man. Why not?"

01:56.049 --> 02:00.553
So underneath all of that,
two people are making the most of it.

02:00.553 --> 02:04.491
They're called the Kray twins.
Ronnie and Reggie, their names are.

02:04.491 --> 02:07.994
Brilliant names.
They are a couple of mobsters.

02:07.994 --> 02:10.229
Couple of right old geezers.

02:10.229 --> 02:13.867
Couple of silly twats,
you might call them.

02:13.867 --> 02:18.771
The Kray twins were renowned
for having a wall of silence.

02:18.771 --> 02:21.908
Nobody would say anything,
because they were terrified.

02:21.908 --> 02:26.112
I'm terrified of them now.
They've been dead for ages.

02:26.112 --> 02:29.549
They would have friends
who would sit like that in bars.

02:29.549 --> 02:32.585
And if they heard anyone say,
"The Krays",

02:32.585 --> 02:36.256
they'd go, "Someone over there
said something about the Krays."

02:36.256 --> 02:38.691
They'd make a note of them.
Grey hair,

02:38.691 --> 02:42.095
and a small cat
that follows him around.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.730
He's the person to take out.

02:44.797 --> 02:48.668
So the Krays go into the pub
and they'd see the guy with the cat.

02:48.668 --> 02:52.472
They'd walk up and they'd go, "You've
been saying bad stuff about us.

02:52.472 --> 02:55.508
The guy would be like,
"No, no, I haven't."

02:55.508 --> 02:57.710
"Actually, I haven't."

02:57.710 --> 02:59.646
(laughs)

03:01.247 --> 03:02.348
No.

03:02.348 --> 03:05.885
"I didn't say anything
about you guys. I love your work."

03:05.885 --> 03:10.924
"Actually, if you could not hurt me,
that would be really helpful."

03:10.924 --> 03:14.394
And Reggie would go,
"I'm not sure I believe you."

03:14.394 --> 03:19.165
And then he would...
he would sort of thumb his eyes out.

03:20.667 --> 03:22.468
On the other hand,

03:22.468 --> 03:26.472
there's a gentleman called
Thomas "Nipper"... Read.

03:26.472 --> 03:27.774
(man) Leonard.

03:28.708 --> 03:33.746
Leonard Read, Nipper,
is a pretty bad-ass cop.

03:33.746 --> 03:35.515
His boss comes to him and says,

03:35.515 --> 03:40.453
"Could we use your skills
to go and get the Kray twins?"

03:40.453 --> 03:43.623
"Who are a right couple
of nincompoops."

03:43.623 --> 03:46.626
"They're really causing some bother."
(laughs)

03:48.962 --> 03:52.432
So, Nipper Read. Every time...

03:52.432 --> 03:56.035
Every time Nipper says something
to anybody, wall of silence.

03:56.035 --> 03:59.105
Nothing.
People just not giving him anything.

03:59.105 --> 04:02.875
He went up to cat-man
after he'd had his eyes taken out.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.611
He's got no eyes.

04:04.611 --> 04:07.947
And he's like,
"What do you think of the Krays?"

04:07.947 --> 04:11.117
Because this guy has been
really attacked by them,

04:11.117 --> 04:14.520
he's going,
"Erm... fine. Great guys."

04:15.488 --> 04:16.956
"Buh-bye."

04:16.956 --> 04:19.158
That's all you get from everyone.

04:19.158 --> 04:24.364
Nipper was like, "I just wish someone
would say, 'They killed my wife.'"

04:24.364 --> 04:25.965
But nobody would say that.

04:25.965 --> 04:29.969
So, Nipper sort of thinks,
"No-one's gonna tell me anything."

04:29.969 --> 04:33.406
"I'm gonna go and just try
and have a little look,

04:33.406 --> 04:34.807
do a bit of espionage."

04:34.807 --> 04:38.011
"See if I can maybe
look through a window."

04:39.412 --> 04:41.914
And Ronnie goes, "Are you Nipper?"

04:41.914 --> 04:43.116
And he goes...

04:43.950 --> 04:45.351
"No."

04:45.351 --> 04:48.554
He goes, "I know you're hanging out.
Do you want to come in?"

04:48.554 --> 04:50.356
"Have a drink?"

04:50.356 --> 04:55.128
And Nipper goes, "Do you know what?
Actually, yeah, I am Nipper."

04:55.128 --> 04:58.598
"I'll come in. Why not?
Do you do WKDs?"

04:58.598 --> 05:00.800
He says, "We'll work something out."

05:00.800 --> 05:04.170
So he goes into the party
and he has a great time.

05:05.304 --> 05:08.174
He's poured a WKD by Ronnie.
He meets Reggie.

05:08.174 --> 05:10.843
Reggie's like,
"What's your name? Nipper."

05:10.843 --> 05:12.845
"Nice to meet you. What do you do?"

05:12.845 --> 05:15.214
Nipper's like,
"I'll be careful here."

05:15.214 --> 05:17.050
"I'm... a..."

05:17.050 --> 05:20.720
"I work nearby a police station."

05:20.720 --> 05:23.456
"In a... just nearby."

05:23.456 --> 05:27.193
The thing is, Reggie's really off
his tits, so he doesn't notice.

05:27.193 --> 05:30.096
Nipper has a great time.
Lots of LOLs.

05:37.036 --> 05:39.472
Nipper's feeling pretty good
about this.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.307
He's thinking, "I'm in there."

05:41.307 --> 05:43.476
He goes to the boss and he goes,

05:43.476 --> 05:45.812
"Boss, you're going to lose your shit

05:45.812 --> 05:48.147
when you find out
what's just happened."

05:48.147 --> 05:51.150
"Last night, I was watching the Krays
have a party."

05:51.150 --> 05:53.886
"They invited me in.
I'm now friends with them."

05:53.886 --> 05:58.324
And the boss is like,
"I sort of know this, actually."

05:58.324 --> 06:00.993
"Because the phone's been going
all night."

06:00.993 --> 06:03.162
"It was lots of people complaining

06:03.162 --> 06:06.199
about you fraternising
with criminals."

06:06.199 --> 06:12.171
"You have let me down. I am, for want
of a better word, livid with you."

06:12.171 --> 06:14.006
Nipper's devastated.

06:14.006 --> 06:17.276
He's like, "I suppose that looks
really bad, doesn't it?"

06:17.276 --> 06:19.545
"I'm in trouble now, aren't I?
Oh, dear."

06:19.545 --> 06:23.082
So was it. Nipper was off the case.

06:23.082 --> 06:25.585
The Krays, the next morning,
are delighted.

06:25.585 --> 06:29.388
"We took out the police officer.
We're pretty cool."

06:29.388 --> 06:31.290
"Let's have a party."

06:31.290 --> 06:33.192
Then they have another party.

06:33.192 --> 06:35.428
The way they partied
is they just did that.

06:39.999 --> 06:42.602
(laughs)

06:42.602 --> 06:46.472
So, let's speed through
the next few years.

06:46.472 --> 06:51.677
The Krays are getting really good
at being criminals.

06:51.677 --> 06:52.745
On the other hand,

06:52.745 --> 06:56.849
Nipper is basically solving crimes
left, right and centre.

06:56.849 --> 07:02.488
And the boss of the murder squad came
to him and said, "OK, first job."

07:02.488 --> 07:04.757
"Brace yourself.
You're gonna love it."

07:04.757 --> 07:08.327
"It's finding the Kray twins
and getting them sorted out."

07:08.327 --> 07:13.733
Nipper's like, "Oh, for fuck's sake.
This again."

07:13.733 --> 07:17.870
So Nipper realises he's not gonna get
the Krays for any of the big stuff.

07:17.870 --> 07:21.007
The Krays knew. The Krays had
upped the wall of silence.

07:21.007 --> 07:22.575
He goes about

07:22.575 --> 07:27.146
and he sees if he can find out
about a few of the littler crimes.

07:27.146 --> 07:30.883
Little bits that he could then
create a beautiful tapestry of crime

07:30.883 --> 07:35.288
that he could put together
to then put them into jail.

07:35.288 --> 07:37.924
No-one else has been drinking this,
have they?

07:37.924 --> 07:39.091
(man) No.

07:39.091 --> 07:42.328
So, Nipper's compiled his evidence.

07:42.328 --> 07:46.632
He gets all of the lads together
from the police station.

07:46.632 --> 07:51.704
He says, "Right, lads.
Have yourselves a nice espresso,

07:51.704 --> 07:57.076
because you're not going to bed until
we arrest all 26 of these people,"

07:57.076 --> 08:00.112
that he's got written down
on a napkin,

08:00.112 --> 08:01.948
cos he just did it in a rush.

08:01.948 --> 08:07.787
The top two names on that napkin
were Ronnie and Reggie Kray.

08:09.121 --> 08:10.890
The Kray twins.

08:10.890 --> 08:15.494
The people we have been
talking about all along.

08:15.494 --> 08:18.598
And somebody goes,
"Excuse me, Nipper."

08:19.432 --> 08:22.535
"Erm... Who's actually
going to arrest the Krays?"

08:22.535 --> 08:26.172
He goes, "Big news.
Bobby Big Potatoes,

08:26.172 --> 08:29.475
me, Nipper,
is going to get the Krays."

08:31.110 --> 08:33.880
So, they're all outside the house.

08:33.880 --> 08:36.448
Everyone's being very quiet.

08:36.448 --> 08:38.317
Nipper's saying to his team,

08:38.317 --> 08:41.988
"We only have one shot at this.
If we get this wrong..."

08:43.489 --> 08:47.326
"...we'll never get them.
Please, don't let me down."

08:48.394 --> 08:51.364
"This has been
a big part of my life."

08:51.364 --> 08:54.567
"And if we can't get this right..."

08:55.568 --> 08:58.237
"I don't know
if I could live with myself."

08:58.237 --> 08:59.305
Somebody farts.

08:59.305 --> 09:01.040
(farts)
And...

09:03.209 --> 09:04.744
(laughs)

09:04.744 --> 09:08.614
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

09:08.614 --> 09:10.549
(laughs)

09:18.391 --> 09:20.493
Please don't use that.

09:20.493 --> 09:23.329
You're gonna have to use that,
aren't you?

09:23.329 --> 09:26.832
Erm...
So, they smash through the door.

09:26.832 --> 09:31.037
They run up the stairs.
There's a huge building in tension.

09:31.037 --> 09:34.907
Everyone's like, "This is it."
They smash through the bedroom door.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.809
Then they hear...

09:36.809 --> 09:38.444
(hums Grieg's Morning Mood)

09:41.547 --> 09:45.151
And they're all...
They're all just sleeping.

09:45.151 --> 09:46.919
They're all snug.

09:46.919 --> 09:50.256
They go,
"We brought far too many men."

09:50.256 --> 09:54.193
Pop some handcuffs on and they go,
"That's it. You're nicked."

09:54.193 --> 09:58.264
"We've got all the evidence we need.
We win."

09:58.264 --> 09:59.532
LOL!

10:00.266 --> 10:02.068
And that's how Nipper...

10:02.068 --> 10:05.805
...Nipper Nips got the Krays.

10:05.805 --> 10:11.010
Here's to you, Nipper,
you brill chap.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.452
Nipper and I have a lot in common.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.253
I've also wasted years of my life

10:21.253 --> 10:23.589
trying to get handcuffs
on a pair of twins.

10:23.589 --> 10:25.591
That's it for part one.

10:25.591 --> 10:29.295
Join us after the break for our
drunkest storyteller of the series.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.796
Can I go to the toilet?

10:30.796 --> 10:32.131
I feel rough.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.834
You are not going to want
to miss this one.

10:34.834 --> 10:36.869
Before you jizz, we're gonna stop.

10:42.875 --> 10:46.645
Welcome back. If you like hearing
obscure historical facts

10:46.645 --> 10:49.949
recounted by comedians too pissed
to tie their shoelaces

10:49.949 --> 10:51.283
then you are in luck.

10:51.283 --> 10:53.586
Somebody farts.
(farts)

10:54.353 --> 10:58.958
(laughs) I'm so sorry.

10:58.958 --> 11:02.028
Now we have the story
of how Bonfire Night came to be.

11:02.028 --> 11:04.430
It's one of my favourite times
of the year.

11:04.430 --> 11:07.266
Explosions, raging fires,
frightened children.

11:07.266 --> 11:09.435
Like a cheeky weekend break
in Syria.

11:09.435 --> 11:13.472
Ben Ashenden drank five beers
and three double vodka-Red Bulls

11:13.472 --> 11:15.408
before telling us
how it started.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.710
I was in a drinking society
at university.

11:17.710 --> 11:22.548
In that respect, I should be
better... better... prepared.

11:24.450 --> 11:28.954
I'm going to tell you about
who's responsible for 5th November,

11:28.954 --> 11:31.924
why we're always out there,
watching the fireworks.

11:31.924 --> 11:34.226
The shit fireworks.

11:34.226 --> 11:35.961
And it's not who you think.

11:35.961 --> 11:38.564
You're looking at me
and saying, "Guy Fawkes."

11:38.564 --> 11:42.001
It's not. It's another fella.
You're gonna find out who.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.771
Lot of booze in that.

11:46.906 --> 11:48.407
That is strong.

11:48.407 --> 11:51.610
We're talking May.
We're talking 1604.

11:51.610 --> 11:56.816
King James I, Protestant. Shouldn't
be a problem, unless you're Catholic.

11:56.816 --> 12:00.086
He's not nice to the Catholics.
He's very nasty.

12:00.086 --> 12:02.788
The Catholics are...
Basically, they're livid.

12:02.788 --> 12:08.761
None more so
than a young Robert Catesby.

12:08.761 --> 12:11.130
"Who's Robert Catesby?"
you're asking.

12:11.130 --> 12:14.200
Catholic lad. Intelligent.
Charismatic.

12:14.200 --> 12:17.169
His view was, "I'm dead against
this James I figure."

12:17.169 --> 12:21.240
"I want to take action. It's gotta be
serious. It's gotta be covert."

12:22.308 --> 12:25.878
"I'm gonna set up a meeting
with my lads."

12:25.878 --> 12:28.314
Meet at this pub
called the Duck and Drake.

12:28.314 --> 12:32.451
He says to the lads,
"Boys, boys, boys, boys."

12:32.451 --> 12:35.921
"Us Catholics are
getting done in every day."

12:35.921 --> 12:40.526
"James is smashing us up."
We've got to do something about it."

12:40.526 --> 12:43.095
The lads are going,
"Yeah. Just a fucking bit."

12:43.095 --> 12:45.931
Catesby's saying,
"I've got a little idea."

12:45.931 --> 12:47.566
He can't wait to tell them.

12:47.566 --> 12:50.903
They're going, "What?
Should we petition for government?"

12:50.903 --> 12:54.573
"Should we educate the people
as to the Catholic plight?"

12:54.573 --> 12:56.809
He's going, "Well,

12:56.809 --> 13:00.312
my idea is we blow up the Houses
of Parliament and kill everyone."

13:03.048 --> 13:05.918
They're going, "What? Kill everyone?"

13:05.918 --> 13:09.688
He's going, "Yeah.
Why, what were you guys thinking?"

13:09.688 --> 13:13.425
"To be perfectly honest, Robert,
that's fucking mental, man."

13:13.425 --> 13:16.395
"You're talking about blowing up
the... What?"

13:16.395 --> 13:20.766
Catesby's like,
"Boys, boys... boys."

13:20.766 --> 13:24.436
"I've checked out all the other
systems. The other routes."

13:24.436 --> 13:25.971
"And it's no go."

13:25.971 --> 13:29.175
"We've gotta blow the shit up.
All of it."

13:29.175 --> 13:31.277
Next step.

13:31.277 --> 13:33.546
"I've got a lad.
He's called Guy Fawkes."

13:33.546 --> 13:36.248
"Trust me,
he's the boy for the deal."

13:36.248 --> 13:39.852
"A, he's from Yorkshire.
B, he's well up for it."

13:39.852 --> 13:44.290
"C... To be perfectly honest,
he's mental."

13:45.824 --> 13:47.760
(burps)

13:49.161 --> 13:50.529
That's a deep burp.

13:51.931 --> 13:53.832
Guy Fawkes walks in.

13:53.832 --> 13:57.903
He says, "All right, lads?
Can I be honest with y'all?"

13:57.903 --> 14:01.173
"I am dead against
this King James the fella."

14:01.173 --> 14:03.309
"I'm gonna wipe him out."

14:03.309 --> 14:06.078
"I am going to A,

14:06.078 --> 14:10.049
rent a basement
underneath the Houses of Parliament."

14:10.049 --> 14:12.585
"B, I'm going to fill it
with gunpowder."

14:12.585 --> 14:14.853
"C, gonna blow it up."

14:15.754 --> 14:16.989
(laughs)

14:16.989 --> 14:19.024
So, they've got the cellar.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.427
They come in there
with their gunpowder,

14:21.427 --> 14:24.230
barrels and barrels
of the fucking shit.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.966
The Catholics are
shitting themselves.

14:26.966 --> 14:31.303
They're thinking, "Oh, hang on.
I've got a couple of mates up there."

14:31.303 --> 14:33.706
One of them writes
to his brother-in-law

14:33.706 --> 14:35.574
to warn him about not turning up.

14:35.574 --> 14:37.443
So he gets this letter.

14:37.443 --> 14:40.946
He's thinking, "Oh, my God.
I've gotta do something about this."

14:40.946 --> 14:44.316
The king's mates have a look at it.
They can't work it out.

14:44.316 --> 14:47.753
The king goes, "Oi, oi, oi! Boys!
Let me have a look at that."

14:47.753 --> 14:49.989
He goes, "Let's have a look at this."

14:49.989 --> 14:51.590
"Whoa!"

14:51.590 --> 14:56.996
"That says 'a terrible surprise'
and 'a massive blow'."

14:57.863 --> 15:01.133
"Guys, they're going to blow up
the Houses of Parliament."

15:01.133 --> 15:04.303
"How have you not...
How have you not..."

15:05.638 --> 15:10.843
"I pay you guys fucking loads.
And you're just letting me down."

15:12.911 --> 15:14.813
So, King James has worked it out.

15:14.813 --> 15:17.116
He's worked out
that they're gonna pounce

15:17.116 --> 15:19.051
on the first night of Parliament.

15:19.051 --> 15:22.788
So he said, "All right, lads.
Let's not be hasty."

15:22.788 --> 15:26.425
"We'll let them get into position
and then we..."

15:28.027 --> 15:32.131
"...get them. Right red-handed."

15:35.034 --> 15:36.368
(clanking)

15:40.005 --> 15:43.575
Meanwhile, the Catholics are getting
a bit nervous,

15:43.575 --> 15:46.812
because Catholic sympathisers
have said,

15:46.812 --> 15:52.051
"Oi, I've heard the king
and his mates know about the plan."

15:52.051 --> 15:56.188
They've said,
"Oh, shit. We are done here."

15:56.188 --> 15:59.625
One Catholic decides, "No."

15:59.625 --> 16:03.162
"I've got it under control.
Don't worry about it."

16:03.162 --> 16:05.264
"My name is Guy Fawkes."

16:08.200 --> 16:11.603
So Guy Fawkes stays in the cellar.

16:11.603 --> 16:14.573
The others... go away.

16:14.573 --> 16:17.476
He's thinking,
"What are you worried about?"

16:19.111 --> 16:23.916
"If you come down here, I will blow
this... I will blow this..."

16:23.916 --> 16:25.851
"I will blow this place up."

16:29.555 --> 16:30.789
"If you..."

16:31.890 --> 16:33.926
So, king's on it.

16:33.926 --> 16:39.164
He says, "Find out if there's anyone
down there who is suspicious."

16:39.164 --> 16:42.201
"Or any Catholics."

16:42.201 --> 16:45.871
The King's men, they bop down there.

16:45.871 --> 16:49.308
They find a certain someone.

16:49.308 --> 16:51.543
He's chilling. He's going...

16:52.811 --> 16:57.049
"You all right?" The guards are like,
"All right, mate? Who are you?"

16:57.049 --> 17:00.452
Guy Fawkes is like,
"Er... my name is..."

17:01.487 --> 17:05.357
"...John... Johns... Johnson."

17:06.290 --> 17:08.359
He gives the name John Johnson.

17:08.359 --> 17:11.230
He's a fucking cretin.

17:11.230 --> 17:15.867
They go, "OK. Well, obviously
fake name. What are you doing here?"

17:15.867 --> 17:21.473
He goes, "What am I doing here?
I'm looking after the barrels of..."

17:22.974 --> 17:24.076
"...gunpowder."

17:24.076 --> 17:26.811
Whoa!

17:26.811 --> 17:31.350
"Whoa! That's a lot of gunpowder."

17:31.350 --> 17:33.118
He goes, "It's not that much."

17:33.118 --> 17:35.254
"Well, 36 barrels, mate."

17:35.254 --> 17:37.189
"What's 36 barrels for?"

17:37.189 --> 17:38.323
(burps)

17:39.591 --> 17:42.995
Oh, man. Can I go to the toilet?

17:43.829 --> 17:45.197
I feel rough.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.134
(man) Go to the toilet.

18:03.215 --> 18:07.052
In a Drunk History first, Ben was
genuinely unable to continue.

18:07.052 --> 18:11.056
After he'd chugged his guts up,
we safely put him to bed

18:11.056 --> 18:14.359
and asked Russell Kane if he fancied
necking a vodka martini,

18:14.359 --> 18:17.329
two double Southern Comforts
and a vodka and Coke

18:17.329 --> 18:21.834
before finishing the story. He
generously accepted. What a hero.

18:21.834 --> 18:25.103
So, Fawkes is taken to the king.

18:25.103 --> 18:26.839
Totally sprung.

18:26.839 --> 18:30.275
The king says to him,
"Dude, do you know what I mean?"

18:30.275 --> 18:34.746
"You definitely... You're definitely
nicked. What's your name?"

18:34.746 --> 18:36.615
He says, "It's John Johnson."

18:36.615 --> 18:40.118
The king was like, "That's
convincing. My name's King Kingly."

18:40.118 --> 18:41.487
They had a bit of banter.

18:41.487 --> 18:43.355
He was like, "Tell you what."

18:43.355 --> 18:46.925
"I'll let you off lightly if you
tell us who you're working with."

18:46.925 --> 18:49.194
Guy was like,
"I was working on my own."

18:49.194 --> 18:52.431
He was like,
"There's 36 barrels there."

18:52.431 --> 18:56.401
"There's no way you've tugged 36
barrels on your own. You liar."

18:56.401 --> 19:00.305
"Fucking Pinocchio mug.
Right. We're gonna torture you."

19:00.305 --> 19:03.275
So they did mild torture methods.

19:03.275 --> 19:06.011
Stuff like,
"We're gonna give you a hand shandy."

19:06.011 --> 19:08.313
"Just before you jizz,
we're gonna stop."

19:08.313 --> 19:12.718
Then they started doing proper stuff.
One of them did a Chinese burn.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.353
He's like, "I can't take it!"

19:14.353 --> 19:16.755
Guy Fawkes held out
for as long as he could.

19:16.755 --> 19:19.992
He lets little pathetic details
slip out, like,

19:19.992 --> 19:22.361
"I wanted to kill the king."

19:22.361 --> 19:25.364
The king's like, "Right.
We've got the information."

19:25.364 --> 19:27.065
"Let's go and find Catesby."

19:27.065 --> 19:29.334
Catesby's like, "The king's coming."

19:29.334 --> 19:33.071
"We'd better check the weapons are
cool, cos we're in a damp house."

19:33.071 --> 19:35.507
"Mildew could have got
into the weapons."

19:35.507 --> 19:37.509
A guy's like, "They look good to me."

19:37.509 --> 19:40.679
"I'll just hold a match
really close to this fuse."

19:40.679 --> 19:42.915
"If it's fucked, it won't explode."

19:44.016 --> 19:45.984
(explosion)

19:45.984 --> 19:49.154
Some of them were blinded.
Some had third-degree burns.

19:49.154 --> 19:52.224
Some knew what to do
and put Clingfilm around the burn.

19:52.224 --> 19:55.794
So the King's thinking,
"I'm not looking forward to this."

19:55.794 --> 19:58.730
He's built it up in his head.

19:58.730 --> 20:01.833
They were going to bring down
the Houses of Parliament.

20:01.833 --> 20:04.069
Kick the door open
with his king foot,

20:04.069 --> 20:06.838
expecting them
to be these ultimate assassins.

20:06.838 --> 20:10.509
Inside is a bunch of fucking
dickheads who'd exploded themselves.

20:10.509 --> 20:13.912
They nick them.
King's like, "You're coming with me."

20:13.912 --> 20:16.815
"I've got nothing to cuff.
There's just a stump."

20:16.815 --> 20:18.383
That's how they found them.

20:18.383 --> 20:21.053
So, King James, to celebrate the day

20:21.053 --> 20:23.956
that Guy Fawkes and his evil plot
was defeated,

20:23.956 --> 20:27.559
he created 5th November
as an event we can celebrate.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.394
Or, as I like to remember it,

20:29.394 --> 20:31.863
when my cousin stuck a sparkler
in his urethra.

20:32.831 --> 20:33.932
Erm...

20:36.134 --> 20:37.603
(laughs)

20:42.074 --> 20:43.875
That's the story of Guy Fawkes.

20:43.875 --> 20:47.713
If you hadn't vomited on the floor,
you'd have finished it yourself.

20:51.049 --> 20:54.086
Get well soon, Ben.
Let that be a lesson to you viewers.

20:54.086 --> 20:57.656
Don't get too drunk, or Russell Kane
will steal your thunder.

20:57.656 --> 21:00.292
That's all for tonight.
This was Drunk History.

21:00.292 --> 21:03.295
I've been Jimmy Carter. Goodnight.
Who fancies a kebab?
