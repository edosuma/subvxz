WEBVTT

03:28.317 --> 03:29.745
Let me take that.

03:29.780 --> 03:32.913
No way, I already told
you, I can carry my one bag.

03:33.682 --> 03:35.454
Sorry I dragged you
all the way out here.

03:35.923 --> 03:37.852
Give me a couple of days.
I'll take care of things,

03:38.254 --> 03:39.425
and we go back home, okay?

03:40.461 --> 03:43.055
I'm actually really happy
I came out with you.

03:43.090 --> 03:44.727
That's nice to be
out of the city and

03:45.334 --> 03:46.432
unplug and

03:46.967 --> 03:50.568
be in a place
where time has kind of stopped.

03:51.404 --> 03:53.307
Time passes in its
own way out here.

03:54.076 --> 03:55.738
Nothing has changed
since I was a kid.

03:56.140 --> 04:02.448
Oh my goodness.
Not even the goats?

04:02.650 --> 04:05.319
They're so cute! Ah!

04:06.155 --> 04:08.586
Yeah, they used to drive
me nuts when I was a kid.

04:10.959 --> 04:14.427
That is awesome.
I bet you were such a cute kid.

04:15.129 --> 04:17.364
Yeah, I was crazy.
Like a tornado.

04:18.100 --> 04:21.500
Well, I guess,
not much has changed.

04:21.869 --> 04:24.030
Yeah, so you better
not mess with me.

04:24.065 --> 04:25.064
Hey!

04:26.067 --> 04:28.441
Good, my shoulder hurts anyway.

04:28.476 --> 04:33.644
Hey! Hello!
Welcome! Vivien!

04:34.013 --> 04:37.450
-So nice to meet you!
-So nice to meet you, finally!

04:39.520 --> 04:41.784
-So good to see you.
-Oh, good to see you!

04:41.819 --> 04:43.852
Come in, come in!
Lunch is ready!

04:43.887 --> 04:45.656
-You must be starving!
-Yeah.

05:17.591 --> 05:18.854
-What? Really?
-Yeah.

05:18.889 --> 05:20.526
I like so much here.

05:20.561 --> 05:23.562
-Oh. Here you are.
-This house is so beautiful.

05:23.597 --> 05:26.895
Oh. Thank you. May I introduce
you to Roy's other aunt?

05:27.330 --> 05:28.369
-Concetta.
-Vivien.

05:34.036 --> 05:35.574
They don't speak English very
well, be patient.

05:52.692 --> 05:54.153
So. Uhm. Are you guys engaged?

05:57.532 --> 05:58.696
Why don't you tell her?

06:03.230 --> 06:04.537
So what did he say?

06:05.039 --> 06:06.869
Oh, it's a secret.

06:06.904 --> 06:09.201
No fair, secrets
don't make friends.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.675
Mmm. No, they don't.

06:11.244 --> 06:13.843
Uh, Roy. Did you go
see the farmhouse?

06:14.615 --> 06:16.010
Not yet.

06:16.045 --> 06:19.783
Oh, it's in bad shape. Every
time I go there, I get mad.

06:20.051 --> 06:21.785
It's best for everyone
if we sell it.

06:26.220 --> 06:27.593
How's school going?

06:28.629 --> 06:30.464
It's over. I lost
my scholarship.

06:31.500 --> 06:32.697
What happened?

06:32.732 --> 06:35.062
I got it because
I was on the swim team.

06:35.097 --> 06:36.965
And I'm not on the team anymore.

06:37.267 --> 06:40.034
Couldn't you find a
job and pay for it?

06:40.069 --> 06:42.036
You could work with your dad
at the garage.

06:42.071 --> 06:43.576
College is too expensive.

06:44.011 --> 06:45.644
That's why I wanna sell the
farmhouse,

06:46.079 --> 06:48.042
so I can pay the tuition fees.

06:49.584 --> 06:52.486
Whatever you want, Roy.
Grandma left it to you.

07:17.810 --> 07:18.941
What happened here?

07:20.912 --> 07:21.911
There was a fire.

07:22.346 --> 07:24.551
It spread to the house
and destroyed it.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.146
How old is this place?

07:26.448 --> 07:29.523
It's been in the family
for generations.

08:26.241 --> 08:29.011
I'm actually a bit sad
about selling it.

08:30.344 --> 08:31.310
So many memories.

08:33.050 --> 08:34.049
You grew up here.

08:34.584 --> 08:36.590
Yeah, and I chose to leave.

08:40.090 --> 08:42.222
Uhm Hey! You made it.

08:42.895 --> 08:43.894
Are you okay?

08:44.666 --> 08:45.665
Yeah.

08:46.034 --> 08:47.667
-What are you?
-Oh

08:48.637 --> 08:49.834
-Are you an object?
-Yeah.

08:49.869 --> 08:55.576
Oh! This is my favorite.
Okay, uhm Can I use you?

08:56.843 --> 08:58.007
Yes, you can.

08:58.676 --> 09:02.077
Okay. Uhm Can Does
everyone use you?

09:02.479 --> 09:05.718
-A lot of people, not everyone.
-Are you a household appliance?

09:06.919 --> 09:08.754
-Not only.
-Are you a kitchen appliance?

09:09.218 --> 09:10.316
No.

09:10.351 --> 09:12.923
You're
not a hose, are you?

09:15.961 --> 09:18.896
Are you colorful?

10:59.130 --> 11:01.031
Come on

11:28.929 --> 11:29.928
Hello?

11:34.528 --> 11:35.494
Hey!

11:39.236 --> 11:42.402
I'm so sorry, I don't speak
Italian. Do you speak English?

11:42.637 --> 11:45.240
Yeah, I Uhm I didn't
mean to scare you.

11:45.275 --> 11:46.340
-Get up here.
-Thank you.

11:46.375 --> 11:48.507
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

11:49.378 --> 11:50.377
Fine.

11:50.912 --> 11:57.054
Uh That is very heavy.
How do you ride this thing?

11:57.790 --> 12:00.057
-Haven't you seen my muscles?

12:00.961 --> 12:02.488
I'm Vivien. Hi.

12:02.523 --> 12:03.322
Anna, nice to meet you.

12:03.357 --> 12:05.524
That
actually does look kind of bad.

12:05.559 --> 12:08.263
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Let's get you inside and

12:08.298 --> 12:10.199
We'll clean that up
so that doesn't get infected.

12:11.565 --> 12:14.071
I'm fine, really, I don't
I don't wanna bother you.

12:14.106 --> 12:16.370
No!
Do not be ridiculous, come on!

12:16.405 --> 12:18.372
-Are you sure?
-Yes, of course!

12:20.607 --> 12:22.079
Your English is so good!

12:22.114 --> 12:24.279
I I studied in
America for a while.

12:32.861 --> 12:33.387
What are we doing here?

12:33.422 --> 12:35.158
Come with me!

12:35.193 --> 12:36.522
I'm sorry Sir,
there's nothing I can do,

12:36.557 --> 12:38.524
that reservation was
definitely canceled.

12:38.559 --> 12:39.558
Oh God

12:42.497 --> 12:47.434
Hey. Did something happen?

12:47.469 --> 12:50.140
Yeah, one of the artists can't
come. It's a major disaster.

12:50.175 --> 12:51.977
He supposed to check
in this morning,

12:52.012 --> 12:53.946
he didn't show up and now the
whole show is falling apart.

12:53.981 --> 12:54.914
I'm so sorry.

12:55.616 --> 12:56.883
-Love, this is
-Roy, right?

12:56.918 --> 12:57.984
Yes.

12:58.019 --> 12:59.479
Roy, I couldn't wait for
you to get here. I'm Thomas.

12:59.514 --> 13:01.283
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

13:01.318 --> 13:02.451
Oh

13:02.486 --> 13:04.990
I'm so sorry, I have to go
and take care of this mess.

13:05.025 --> 13:06.255
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay. Go fix it. Love you.

13:06.290 --> 13:07.289
Love you too.

13:07.824 --> 13:10.457
-So where did he come from?

13:10.792 --> 13:12.998
I met him in London
at an exhibition.

13:13.200 --> 13:17.266
And Vivien's been putting up
with you for what Six months?

13:17.301 --> 13:18.366
Give or take.

13:19.035 --> 13:21.138
She ain't exactly low
maintenance either.

13:21.173 --> 13:23.943
So you're made for
each other.

13:24.638 --> 13:28.442
Well This was your mother's.

13:29.011 --> 13:33.150
We used to dream about meeting
our true loves, getting married

13:33.647 --> 13:34.987
and Vivien

13:35.689 --> 13:40.223
I have a feeling she can't wait
to get a ring on her finger. So

13:44.493 --> 13:47.296
-Thank you.
-Oh Don't make me cry.

13:49.069 --> 13:51.630
Hey listen, I used up my film.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.500
Is there anywhere
I can develop it?

13:53.535 --> 13:55.975
Sure! Thomas has a dark room
at the gallery, let's go!

13:56.670 --> 13:58.472
Thank you, you saved me.

14:00.047 --> 14:02.245
No, trust me, you saved me.

14:02.577 --> 14:04.049
My uhm

14:04.418 --> 14:07.646
My boyfriend and I came to visit
his relatives and

14:08.882 --> 14:13.685
It's just really not been easy
to find someone to talk to.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.027
Yeah, I'm sorry, it's

14:15.763 --> 14:18.195
A lot of Italians
don't speak great English.

14:18.230 --> 14:20.494
Yeah, but you're pretty fluent.
Where did you go to school?

14:21.029 --> 14:23.904
Oh, this place in In New Jersey.

14:24.773 --> 14:27.171
New Jersey, really?
That's where we're from.

14:27.840 --> 14:33.375
-So, do you study Medicine?
-Ah No. Physics.

14:34.147 --> 14:35.377
That's really cool.

14:35.912 --> 14:38.380
It always fascinated me,
but I never thought I could

14:39.251 --> 14:40.052
understand it.

14:42.254 --> 14:43.352
So

14:43.387 --> 14:44.958
How do you manage it
while you're here?

14:45.593 --> 14:49.523
I don't. Uhm, but I'll
go back really soon

14:50.025 --> 14:51.459
And I'm so excited

14:51.494 --> 14:53.263
because my school got me

14:53.298 --> 14:55.694
this internship
with a big company.

14:55.729 --> 14:59.236
-So, I'm happy!
-Yeah, sounds cool.

15:00.602 --> 15:04.571
-What do you do?
-Oh I I do a bunch of things.

15:04.806 --> 15:07.211
Right now I'm here
for the<i> vendemmia</i> .

15:07.642 --> 15:08.707
The grape

15:09.578 --> 15:10.610
-Harvest.
-Oh, cool.

15:10.912 --> 15:12.249
And it starts tomorrow,

15:12.284 --> 15:14.284
you really really have to come.

15:14.619 --> 15:16.990
I can't tomorrow.
I leave tomorrow morning.

15:18.719 --> 15:20.059
You know, I've got an idea

15:23.130 --> 15:25.295
-You're coming with me.
-What?

15:25.330 --> 15:27.297
Oh, it's your last
day here and you

15:27.632 --> 15:30.234
can't spend it
cooped up in here all alone.

15:34.504 --> 15:35.503
So, do you like it?

15:36.239 --> 15:40.013
Oh "I like it"
is an understatement.

15:40.609 --> 15:42.015
It's beautiful.

15:42.479 --> 15:43.577
Good, I'm happy.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.284
It's one of my favorite places.

15:47.853 --> 15:51.585
-It's just so nice to just walk.
-Yeah.

15:52.192 --> 15:53.191
Thinking

15:56.064 --> 15:57.129
So serene

15:57.659 --> 15:59.098
It is, it's quiet.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.165
No people.

16:02.201 --> 16:04.136
-Yeah.
-Just the two of us.

16:19.681 --> 16:20.680
What are you doing?

16:21.485 --> 16:24.057
I'm gonna go for a swim.

16:25.192 --> 16:26.488
-What?
-Yeah.

16:27.457 --> 16:31.328
You're gonna go swimming right
now Isn't it like too cold?

16:31.697 --> 16:34.661
Oh, it's never too cold in
Sicily, believe me.

16:34.696 --> 16:36.333
The water is great!

16:39.701 --> 16:41.767
Oh my Goodness, it's
gonna be so cold!

16:45.212 --> 16:46.574
Oh, I'm good about that!

16:59.457 --> 17:01.820
Oh yes! Freedom!

18:40.228 --> 18:43.163
This is, honestly, breathtaking.

18:43.865 --> 18:47.299
I told you. I knew you
were gonna love it.

18:47.334 --> 18:49.928
Uh How did that happen?

18:52.240 --> 18:55.472
-Uhm Shark attack.
-What?

18:57.245 --> 19:01.610
Oh, you
had me. You had me!

19:01.645 --> 19:05.383
I got burned when I was a kid.

19:06.319 --> 19:12.951
And I guess you really
shouldn't play with fire.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.197
Well

19:17.999 --> 19:23.302
I think scars are kind
of really beautiful.

19:24.602 --> 19:28.208
They like tell a person's story.

19:29.010 --> 19:31.970
Well, maybe one day
I'll tell you mine.

19:33.677 --> 19:34.841
-Deal.
-Yeah.

19:36.713 --> 19:42.255
I have to tell you, I think your
boyfriend is a really lucky man.

19:43.720 --> 19:45.423
Have you guys been together
for a long time?

19:48.824 --> 19:49.955
No.

19:49.990 --> 19:55.829
But Roy was there for me in
like, a really

19:58.306 --> 20:00.570
bad time in my life.

20:00.605 --> 20:01.604
Uhm

20:02.673 --> 20:03.672
And so I feel like

20:04.906 --> 20:07.280
I don't know, like
he knows who I am.

20:08.877 --> 20:09.843
Yeah.

20:10.111 --> 20:12.615
What about you? Do you
have someone

20:12.650 --> 20:14.782
special enough
to appreciate all this beauty?

20:15.884 --> 20:17.752
Actually Yeah, I do.

20:18.121 --> 20:19.721
His name is Tony and I've

20:20.356 --> 20:23.461
I've known him for a
really really long time and

20:25.663 --> 20:26.464
It's just that

20:27.896 --> 20:30.930
I think you never
really know people.

20:39.644 --> 20:41.611
Where were you?
I called you all afternoon.

20:42.746 --> 20:44.614
Uhm I made a friend.

20:44.649 --> 20:47.749
The reception was bad
and then my battery died.

20:47.784 --> 20:49.289
This is
Anna, by the way.

20:49.758 --> 20:53.722
Nice to meet you. Vivien
told me so much about you.

20:58.091 --> 20:59.464
You had me so fucking worried.

21:00.764 --> 21:02.093
I'm sorry, baby.

21:02.128 --> 21:04.337
I thought you were going
to be back way later.

21:04.672 --> 21:07.571
And then Anna showed me this
amazing place, so beautiful.

21:07.606 --> 21:08.407
Yeah.

21:08.909 --> 21:11.443
I really have to go, so

21:12.078 --> 21:14.578
I hope I'll get to
see you again. Yeah?

21:14.613 --> 21:18.417
-Yes, very nice to meet you!
-Yeah, for me too! Bye!

21:18.452 --> 21:19.682
-Bye!
-Bye bye!

21:26.460 --> 21:27.690
Who was that? Mm?

21:30.057 --> 21:32.024
I told you, this
girl I met today.

21:32.326 --> 21:36.369
Uhm, she fell off her motorcycle
and I helped her out.

21:38.472 --> 21:40.472
Then she took you on
some sort of adventure

21:40.507 --> 21:42.441
just because she liked you?

21:42.806 --> 21:43.673
Yeah.

21:45.138 --> 21:48.645
I'm sorry, are you like, jealous
or What's happening here?

21:49.945 --> 21:51.010
No, I'm just curious.

21:54.015 --> 21:55.014
Okay.

21:56.556 --> 21:57.555
Are you packed?

21:59.526 --> 22:01.856
Yeah, I have
a couple of things left to grab.

22:03.024 --> 22:04.023
Okay, we should hurry up.

22:04.658 --> 22:06.630
We're leaving
at the crack of dawn tomorrow.

22:41.700 --> 22:42.699
Oh my God!

22:43.801 --> 22:44.536
What happened?

22:45.902 --> 22:48.540
A volcano erupted and they
canceled all the flights.

22:49.142 --> 22:52.577
I guess you already know.
Our volcano is a female.

22:53.481 --> 22:55.580
Unpredictable and restless.

22:55.782 --> 22:57.417
We need to get the
hell out of here.

22:57.819 --> 22:59.881
But they don't know when the
flights are gonna resume.

23:00.583 --> 23:02.114
You're not stuck here forever.

23:02.416 --> 23:04.050
You can make it a vacation.

23:04.085 --> 23:05.491
I could use some extra hands.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.724
-What for?
-What do you mean "what for"?

23:08.359 --> 23:10.892
The grape harvest!
You guys can help!

23:11.594 --> 23:15.798
A grape harvest doesn't sound
that bad. I've never been.

23:17.868 --> 23:18.801
It's so annoying.

23:24.941 --> 23:27.073
No need to run!

23:37.283 --> 23:39.085
This is my boyfriend Tony.

23:39.287 --> 23:40.252
-Hi!
-Hi!

23:40.288 --> 23:42.660
-Vivien. Nice to meet you!
-Nice to meet you.

23:42.695 --> 23:43.427
He's a singer.

23:43.463 --> 23:44.926
Do you
play the guitar?

23:44.961 --> 23:47.764
-I can drink wine also.

23:48.099 --> 23:50.063
Yeah!
That's a great answer!

23:50.098 --> 23:51.064
Yeah.

23:51.099 --> 23:54.133
-I like that.
-Just need a bit of red courage.

25:03.710 --> 25:04.709
Hey!

26:17.784 --> 26:18.915
You, wait there.

26:20.083 --> 26:21.082
Wait.

26:49.343 --> 26:50.408
That was fun.

26:52.082 --> 26:53.081
Yeah.

26:53.985 --> 26:55.413
Do you mean now or today?

26:55.748 --> 26:59.318
Both

27:00.959 --> 27:01.958
Yeah.

27:06.426 --> 27:08.800
Anna and Tony are
so cute together.

27:09.462 --> 27:10.670
I guess.

27:12.003 --> 27:13.805
You don't like Anna, do you?

27:15.204 --> 27:16.434
I don't know, like

27:17.003 --> 27:19.338
She's always hanging around you,
haven't you noticed?

27:21.177 --> 27:22.176
I mean

27:23.377 --> 27:25.883
We like each other, that's all.

27:28.756 --> 27:30.954
She showed up at the house
when you were all alone.

27:31.517 --> 27:32.450
Out of the blue.

27:33.354 --> 27:34.727
Don't you think it's weird?

27:36.027 --> 27:38.995
No, I told you. She
fell off her bike.

27:39.330 --> 27:40.326
Did you see her fall?

27:40.528 --> 27:43.164
No, but

27:43.199 --> 27:49.302
Why would she do that,
like, who would fake that?

27:49.337 --> 27:50.743
She was bleeding.

27:51.405 --> 27:52.404
I don't know.

27:52.706 --> 27:54.307
I'm just telling you
what I think, but

27:55.882 --> 27:57.013
I'm sorry if I upset you.

27:58.346 --> 27:59.818
No, I'm not upset.

28:01.855 --> 28:02.854
I just

28:05.925 --> 28:07.826
I just think she needs friends.

28:09.225 --> 28:10.224
You just met her.

28:12.426 --> 28:13.766
You never really know people.

28:25.208 --> 28:26.207
Roy?

29:19.328 --> 29:23.429
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten,

29:23.464 --> 29:26.168
eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,

29:26.203 --> 29:27.906
seventeen, eighteen,
nineteen, twenty,

29:27.941 --> 29:29.303
-twenty-one
-You're amazing!

29:32.242 --> 29:33.141
Yes!

29:33.177 --> 29:35.012
-Hey, you two!
-Hey, babe.

29:35.047 --> 29:36.849
-Good morning!
-Good morning.

29:36.884 --> 29:37.916
Good morning, April.

29:39.117 --> 29:40.116
Hi.

29:42.516 --> 29:43.988
-What's going on?

29:45.321 --> 29:47.827
The school called.
They're moving up my internship.

29:48.588 --> 29:50.830
-When do you start?
-A week.

29:52.229 --> 29:53.459
Don't worry. We'll
be home by then.

29:53.994 --> 29:56.297
What if they don't
reschedule the flight?

29:57.333 --> 29:58.970
Don't worry, we'll
figure it out.

30:58.493 --> 30:59.492
Do you like it?

31:00.594 --> 31:02.198
Yes, looks like a sketch.

31:03.034 --> 31:04.563
It's all in the eye
of the beholder.

31:07.106 --> 31:08.941
This artist has an amazing eye.

31:10.208 --> 31:12.670
You do too. That's
why I called you.

31:14.311 --> 31:16.949
Now, the thing that really
struck me about you, Roy,

31:16.984 --> 31:18.676
is there's something

31:20.086 --> 31:21.349
uneasy, you know?

31:21.884 --> 31:24.352
Something restless
in your landscapes.

31:24.620 --> 31:25.650
Take a sit.

31:29.755 --> 31:32.558
Each shot conveys
something different,

31:32.927 --> 31:36.067
and yet they all have
something in common.

31:36.597 --> 31:37.596
Your gaze.

31:38.731 --> 31:40.269
I'm not sure what
you're getting at.

31:40.771 --> 31:43.404
One of the artists just
backed out the show I'm doing.

31:44.273 --> 31:46.440
I've been looking
for a new talent.

31:46.775 --> 31:50.246
Somebody who's got something
truly original to contribute.

31:50.581 --> 31:51.814
I was getting desperate

31:51.849 --> 31:54.954
because you know how hard that
is to find on such short notice.

31:55.323 --> 31:58.089
And Laura brought
me your photos.

32:00.456 --> 32:02.555
I'd like to show these
if that's all right with you.

32:04.097 --> 32:05.965
Are you kidding
me? That's amazing!

32:06.634 --> 32:09.760
I have to talk to Vivien but
Yes, thank you so much!

32:09.795 --> 32:11.003
No, no. Thank you.

32:11.872 --> 32:16.305
So, I'll start working on this
and I plan to see you tomorrow

32:16.340 --> 32:17.273
What time?

32:17.308 --> 32:18.538
Yeah, I can't wait to start.

32:18.573 --> 32:19.473
At- 30pm?

32:19.508 --> 32:20.507
-Yeah.
-Great.

32:22.577 --> 32:24.181
-Hey!
-Hey!

32:24.216 --> 32:25.446
Thomas wants my photos!

32:26.284 --> 32:28.086
-What?
-Yes!

32:28.121 --> 32:30.022
He wants to do a show
in his art gallery!

32:30.858 --> 32:32.585
I'm so excited, I
can't believe it!

32:32.620 --> 32:35.522
That's awesome! Congrats, baby!

32:35.557 --> 32:37.623
-When is the show?
-I still don't know.

32:38.494 --> 32:39.658
Well

32:39.693 --> 32:41.132
We should probably
figure that out,

32:41.167 --> 32:43.002
because I have to leave soon
for my internship.

32:45.204 --> 32:47.336
What? What did I
say? What's wrong?

32:49.142 --> 32:50.768
I thought you would
be happy for me.

32:51.737 --> 32:55.212
Of course I'm happy for you
I'm so happy for you!

32:55.247 --> 32:57.049
Yeah, so happy you
can't wait to leave!

32:58.481 --> 33:02.450
Uh I have to actually get back,
this is about my future.

33:03.119 --> 33:04.782
Do you still give a
shit about my future?

33:04.817 --> 33:06.091
That's why we're here!

33:06.560 --> 33:08.819
For your future,
that's why we came,

33:08.854 --> 33:10.194
so that you could
sell the farmhouse

33:10.229 --> 33:11.360
and have money for school.

33:17.698 --> 33:18.697
What?

33:19.499 --> 33:21.799
I don't think school is the
right path for me anymore.

33:24.837 --> 33:26.210
What?

33:26.712 --> 33:27.640
What are you talking about?

33:28.342 --> 33:29.807
Are you coming with me or not?

33:31.217 --> 33:32.315
Hi, uhm

33:32.850 --> 33:35.648
-Bad timing?
-No No, not at all.

33:37.355 --> 33:40.422
-Guys! What are you up to today?
-Nothing!

33:41.425 --> 33:43.821
Wonderful, then come with us,
we're going for a walk.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.527
No, man. I don't feel like it.
I'm not in the mood.

33:47.029 --> 33:49.233
I do! Sounds like a great idea.

33:50.896 --> 33:52.203
Great. Let's go.

34:00.642 --> 34:02.279
You're so quiet today,
something wrong?

34:04.448 --> 34:05.612
Oh

34:08.188 --> 34:12.685
I have to go back to the States,
but I think Roy wants to stay.

34:14.260 --> 34:15.259
You guys had a fight?

34:18.495 --> 34:21.826
It's more like I'm learning
things about him

34:21.861 --> 34:23.630
that I didn't know before.

34:24.270 --> 34:25.369
Mm

34:25.405 --> 34:27.733
Well, I guess that's quite
normal when a relationship

34:27.768 --> 34:29.240
starts to get more serious.

34:29.275 --> 34:30.439
Do you still trust him, right?

34:32.641 --> 34:33.640
Yeah.

34:35.941 --> 34:38.249
Hey, where are you going?
Aren't we going to the top?

34:38.944 --> 34:39.877
Yeah but

34:40.880 --> 34:42.253
That way is way more difficult.

34:43.817 --> 34:45.421
It's way faster.

34:45.456 --> 34:47.390
I don't think so.
It's not faster.

34:47.425 --> 34:48.754
Why don't we have a race?

34:49.089 --> 34:50.822
It's gonna be boys against girls

34:50.857 --> 34:53.264
-Race, race, race, race.
-Okay.

34:53.926 --> 34:55.134
That's a stupid idea.

34:55.369 --> 34:57.499
Well, I think the boys
are just scared

34:57.534 --> 34:59.732
that we're gonna kick
their asses.

35:00.434 --> 35:02.768
Okay then. Remember,
no running allowed.

35:03.270 --> 35:05.408
And I'll know if you cheat,
so don't even try.

35:05.443 --> 35:07.806
All right, I'm gonna send you
a postcard from there.

35:07.841 --> 35:09.643
-Yeah. I'll send you one too.
-Signed it.

35:09.678 --> 35:10.677
Yeah.

35:20.359 --> 35:22.293
Is it gonna be like
this the whole way?

35:23.494 --> 35:24.493
Pretty much.

35:26.233 --> 35:27.265
I need help.

35:38.872 --> 35:40.311
At the end of the month

35:40.346 --> 35:41.279
I'm doing a gig
with my band in Catania.

35:42.513 --> 35:43.710
I would have invited you guys.

35:45.384 --> 35:46.812
Is that what you do?
Are you a musician?

35:47.815 --> 35:49.221
Is that your thing?

35:49.949 --> 35:50.948
Yeah.

35:50.983 --> 35:52.785
After ten years of school. Yeah.

35:53.154 --> 35:54.490
But it's fine, it's my thing.

35:56.593 --> 35:58.395
What about you?
Are you studying at school?

36:00.531 --> 36:03.532
I'm still
looking for my thing.

36:23.554 --> 36:28.260
Anna! What are these trees
called? They're so beautiful!

36:37.865 --> 36:38.864
Anna!

36:45.675 --> 36:46.674
Anna!

36:54.046 --> 36:55.012
Oh shit!

36:59.854 --> 37:00.853
Anna!

37:05.057 --> 37:07.365
Can anyone hear me?

37:17.102 --> 37:18.607
Your girlfriend seems amazing.

37:19.309 --> 37:21.544
Anna was telling me
she studies incredible things.

37:22.910 --> 37:24.448
Yeah, she's very determined,

37:24.983 --> 37:27.451
and unlike me,
she always knows what she wants.

37:27.686 --> 37:30.047
Anna
is like that too.

37:48.639 --> 37:50.672
So, have you guys been together
for a long time?

37:51.274 --> 37:52.641
We've known each
other for years.

37:53.611 --> 37:56.315
But she never saw me that way.

38:00.079 --> 38:01.078
So what changed?

38:01.447 --> 38:03.355
A few weeks ago she
came looking for me,

38:03.990 --> 38:07.326
and she suggested
I go with her on this trip.

38:08.153 --> 38:09.319
So it hasn't been
that long then.

38:09.354 --> 38:13.090
Like, you basically hooked up
right before we got here.

38:14.159 --> 38:15.367
Yeah.

38:21.705 --> 38:22.704
Fuck!

38:56.542 --> 39:00.005
I'm sorry!

39:00.340 --> 39:01.677
Where's Vivien?

39:02.479 --> 39:05.142
I don't know, I turned around
and she just wasn't there.

39:05.377 --> 39:08.178
Hey, hold on. Breathe!
Tell us what happened.

39:08.213 --> 39:11.390
We got lost.

39:11.854 --> 39:13.150
Okay I I

39:15.055 --> 39:16.890
I don't know what happened,
I turned around

39:17.225 --> 39:18.991
and I looked everywhere
and I called her,

39:19.026 --> 39:20.157
and she just wasn't there.

39:20.192 --> 39:22.060
I felt the best thing
that I could do

39:22.095 --> 39:22.894
was to come and tell you guys

39:22.929 --> 39:24.700
so we could look
for her together.

39:24.735 --> 39:26.768
-It was you, wasn't it?

39:26.803 --> 39:28.002
Why are you sayi--

39:28.038 --> 39:31.608
I should have never left her
with you. It's all your fault!

39:31.643 --> 39:34.039
Dude! Calm down! Anna
didn't do anything!

39:36.043 --> 39:37.944
Of course she did. It was her!

39:40.982 --> 39:46.425
I get it. You're afraid.
But we have to go find her.

39:47.626 --> 39:48.525
Now.

39:48.561 --> 39:51.727
I think I lost her
somewhere over there.

39:51.762 --> 39:53.465
You think or you're sure?

39:53.500 --> 39:55.731
I don't know, I think!
I'm pretty sure, I don't know!

39:57.570 --> 39:58.436
Take this.

39:58.471 --> 40:00.571
I'm going alone,
you guys go that way,

40:00.606 --> 40:02.573
just in case you got it wrong.

40:04.577 --> 40:05.576
Vivien!

40:42.274 --> 40:43.240
Vivien!

40:46.817 --> 40:48.784
Baby, baby wake up, wake up.

40:50.557 --> 40:51.589
Are you okay?

40:52.658 --> 40:53.789
-Yeah.
-What happened?

40:54.319 --> 40:56.693
I

40:59.291 --> 41:02.633
Can you move your leg?

41:02.668 --> 41:03.634
Yeah.

41:04.604 --> 41:05.603
Okay.

41:10.335 --> 41:11.972
-What happened?
-I

41:13.712 --> 41:16.273
Uh Ouch, okay, okay, thank you.

41:16.308 --> 41:17.780
Are you sure?

41:17.815 --> 41:21.146
Yeah, I don't know, I got lost.

41:21.181 --> 41:23.687
I was looking for Anna.

41:36.702 --> 41:37.701
Are you actually okay?

41:40.365 --> 41:43.135
I'm okay. I just miss home.

41:48.945 --> 41:52.584
-I don't need to do the show.
-No, you should

41:54.181 --> 41:55.312
I miss our lives.

41:56.348 --> 41:57.589
I think it's time to go back.

42:02.387 --> 42:03.826
Today you really scared me.

42:06.127 --> 42:09.194
I almost lost you once.
I won't let that happen again.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.251
Thomas just got here.

42:35.662 --> 42:37.354
I I think I better
go and talk to him.

42:39.358 --> 42:40.764
It's gonna be hard to tell him

42:40.799 --> 42:42.634
I changed idea about doing
the show.

42:44.231 --> 42:45.230
I'll see you at home, okay?

42:45.903 --> 42:46.902
Okay.

44:01.440 --> 44:02.439
Wow!

44:04.146 --> 44:05.783
So beautiful.

44:07.985 --> 44:09.985
Wait. Where is everyone?

44:10.654 --> 44:12.757
There's a flower festival
in town.

44:13.025 --> 44:14.924
And they couldn't wait to go.

44:15.259 --> 44:18.158
And I couldn't wait to have
some time alone with you.

44:19.194 --> 44:21.898
Oh, is this all for me?

44:28.005 --> 44:29.466
So did you this all by yourself?

44:30.942 --> 44:32.139
Nicola gave me a hand.

44:34.506 --> 44:38.211
To us. To our future together,
and to going back home.

44:38.846 --> 44:40.818
Finally they opened up the
flights again.

44:41.315 --> 44:42.215
To us!

44:51.160 --> 44:52.192
What's wrong?

44:54.526 --> 44:56.328
You can't pass up that show.

44:57.903 --> 44:59.232
But you need to get back home!

45:00.070 --> 45:01.069
What will you do?

45:03.040 --> 45:04.237
I don't know,

45:04.906 --> 45:08.208
I'll call the university,
ask for an extension.

45:08.243 --> 45:09.781
I'll figure it out.

45:10.817 --> 45:12.047
Isn't it gonna be hard on you?

45:12.883 --> 45:15.952
They chose me, and
Thomas chose you,

45:17.252 --> 45:20.022
and your photos are
so beautiful. It's

45:21.025 --> 45:22.024
It's worth it.

45:23.225 --> 45:24.158
You give me strength,

45:24.193 --> 45:26.094
like no one else
has ever given me before.

45:29.561 --> 45:31.066
I have a lot of doubts in life.

45:33.598 --> 45:35.070
But there is one
thing I'm sure about.

45:36.469 --> 45:38.205
I wanna spend
the rest of my life with you.

45:40.407 --> 45:41.406
Would you marry me?

46:07.401 --> 46:10.006
-Are you okay?

46:10.041 --> 46:11.909
Me and Tony had
a really big fight.

46:12.406 --> 46:17.310
Oh It's okay.

46:17.345 --> 46:19.279
It's just a fight, you guys
will get past it, right?

46:22.218 --> 46:23.822
Well, where is he right now?

46:24.191 --> 46:26.286
At a party in Noto.

46:30.490 --> 46:32.193
Do you wanna go celebrate?

46:33.130 --> 46:34.129
Wherever you want.

46:36.628 --> 46:37.869
Let's go track him down.

46:37.904 --> 46:39.365
-Okay.
-Let's see what he's doing!

46:40.269 --> 46:41.035
I'll be right back.

46:41.370 --> 46:44.271
Okay, we can
have a drink.

46:55.983 --> 46:59.451
Oh Wow! Oh!

46:59.486 --> 47:01.618
Hi guys, it's a theme party.

47:01.653 --> 47:04.995
So girls change in here
and boys over there.

47:06.460 --> 47:07.558
Do you want a drink?

47:07.593 --> 47:09.329
Okay, let's go!

47:09.364 --> 47:13.069
Oh wow!
Oh! This is amazing.

47:13.905 --> 47:17.403
-Uh, drinks! Perfect!
-So pretty!

47:19.374 --> 47:23.640
-Okay, what about
-It's too much!

47:23.675 --> 47:26.148
-Okay.
-Here! Drink.

47:29.549 --> 47:31.351
I'm really bad at drinking.

47:31.886 --> 47:35.355
-Come on, it's a party.
-I'm such a lightweight Like

47:35.390 --> 47:37.291
I know, but I can't
be the only drunk one.

47:37.760 --> 47:42.164
And I'll take care of you
if you get too drunk, I swear!

47:46.038 --> 47:48.665
Uh, good. Wow, oh

47:48.700 --> 47:51.272
-Another one.
-Okay.

47:53.243 --> 47:56.915
-Oh my God, Anna!
-What?

47:58.083 --> 48:02.921
-This one!
-Is that for you?

48:03.590 --> 48:08.553
-No, what?
-Come on, I can't wear that!

48:08.588 --> 48:10.225
Why not?

48:11.261 --> 48:13.063
It's not for me, you know?

48:13.098 --> 48:15.725
-Oh Okay, is it too much?
-I'm not sexy

48:15.760 --> 48:17.595
-You are.
-And I don't think

48:17.630 --> 48:19.102
that's my color anyway.

48:24.637 --> 48:26.978
Okay

48:31.314 --> 48:32.412
It is now.

48:34.020 --> 48:35.448
Well, I guess it
could be for tonight.

48:35.917 --> 48:37.989
-Come on!

48:38.524 --> 48:41.619
I'm still the only one that's
getting drunk. It's not right!

48:41.654 --> 48:45.128
Okay Cheers.

48:58.044 --> 49:01.441
-Wow!
-Wow!

52:55.578 --> 52:57.677
Babe, don't.

53:07.557 --> 53:08.556
It's okay.

53:09.790 --> 53:13.495
Should I I feel like
Should I go after him?

53:14.058 --> 53:15.266
No, it's

53:16.533 --> 53:18.269
I think you should talk
about it tomorrow

53:18.304 --> 53:19.600
-when you're rested.

53:20.202 --> 53:23.571
-It's all right. It's all right!
-Sorry! I

53:24.240 --> 53:27.542
-That's all right.
-I agree. I'm also

53:27.577 --> 53:28.609
like, a little bit drunk.

53:28.911 --> 53:31.975
So I feel like I shouldn't
talk about it tonight.

53:32.615 --> 53:33.614
Yeah.

53:34.383 --> 53:36.914
Let's just. lay down
for a bit, alright?

53:49.764 --> 53:50.763
It's okay.

54:43.389 --> 54:45.015
Stay away from me.

54:45.450 --> 54:47.490
Are you
sure that's what you want?

55:47.046 --> 55:48.419
Hey.

55:48.854 --> 55:49.849
Had too much to drink?

55:53.118 --> 55:55.756
I saw you guys dancing in there.
But I didn't say hello.

55:56.858 --> 55:58.121
I didn't wanna talk to Anna.

56:00.224 --> 56:01.828
Anna seems like the coolest,

56:01.863 --> 56:04.402
funniest, sexiest person
in the world.

56:05.669 --> 56:06.668
And she is.

56:08.573 --> 56:09.572
But behind all that

56:11.873 --> 56:13.708
she's hiding what
she really wants.

56:16.911 --> 56:18.581
She used me without
a second thought.

56:22.983 --> 56:23.882
You kill the relationship

56:23.918 --> 56:25.951
when you lie to someone
you say you love.

56:30.760 --> 56:31.726
You better watch it, Roy.

56:34.126 --> 56:36.731
But you already know
exactly what she's like.

56:39.571 --> 56:40.900
You know her better than anyone.

56:52.078 --> 56:53.748
I really
shouldn't have drunk.

56:56.885 --> 56:57.983
I completely overdid it.

57:04.629 --> 57:05.760
How come you left last night?

57:08.226 --> 57:09.225
What?

57:10.635 --> 57:11.601
How come you left me?

57:14.298 --> 57:16.199
Seems to me you were doing
just fine without me.

57:24.814 --> 57:25.945
Well, nothing happened.

57:34.120 --> 57:35.493
Would you please look at me?

57:41.226 --> 57:43.666
Why does Anna have a tattoo
exactly like yours?

57:44.867 --> 57:45.866
Why's that?

57:46.134 --> 57:47.637
-How the hell should I know
-Uh.

57:49.135 --> 57:50.266
Why are you bullshitting me?

57:52.908 --> 57:54.611
What is going on
between you guys?

57:54.646 --> 57:56.877
There's nothing going on, okay?

57:57.679 --> 57:59.781
-Clearly something is--
-What are you stressing about?

58:02.115 --> 58:03.719
Why won't you tell me the truth?

58:05.019 --> 58:06.722
There's something I don't know.

58:06.757 --> 58:09.318
It's you, her, me in the middle
and what's going on?

58:09.353 --> 58:10.693
No, listen to me.
There's me and you.

58:12.059 --> 58:13.894
You invited Anna in our life.

58:14.696 --> 58:16.633
I don't wanna have anything
to do with her.

58:18.868 --> 58:20.571
You're not telling me something.

58:24.874 --> 58:28.073
What aren't you telling me?
Is it really that bad?

58:31.947 --> 58:33.078
You don't trust me anymore.

58:33.547 --> 58:35.817
We're supposed to be
getting married now.

58:35.852 --> 58:37.016
Yes, we are getting married.

58:37.485 --> 58:39.854
I'm not fighting about this,
but you're lying!

58:40.056 --> 58:42.560
Have you changed because a
random girl has my tattoo, uh?

58:42.962 --> 58:44.320
I have a million tattoos
on my skin.

58:44.355 --> 58:46.993
Because I know there's
something else.

58:50.801 --> 58:52.196
I don't know what
you're talking about.

58:52.498 --> 58:54.198
-Uh
-You're stressing about nothing.

58:57.236 --> 58:58.235
Oh, hey!

58:59.371 --> 59:03.779
Roy, someone made an offer on
the farm. We have to go to Noto.

59:04.248 --> 59:06.177
Okay, I I'll be out shortly,
just give me a second.

59:06.212 --> 59:07.211
Yeah. Okay.

59:12.416 --> 59:14.185
We support each
other, always. Okay?

59:15.188 --> 59:16.187
Tonight I'll explain.

59:17.762 --> 59:18.761
Trust me.

59:20.963 --> 59:22.633
Things have been weird lately.

59:23.068 --> 59:24.063
But I love you.

59:25.770 --> 59:26.769
Hey.

59:28.234 --> 59:29.640
We made a promise.

59:32.073 --> 59:33.072
See you later, okay?

59:45.416 --> 59:46.822
Thanks for coming.

59:46.857 --> 59:47.889
No problem.

59:48.591 --> 59:50.320
I just wanted to see
it one more time,

59:50.355 --> 59:52.663
although this place really
grabbed me from the get-go.

59:53.996 --> 59:55.666
It's gonna need a lot of work.

59:56.295 --> 59:57.294
Right. Sure.

59:57.763 --> 59:59.835
It's got loads of charm
but it's falling apart.

1:00:00.604 --> 1:00:02.937
Still, this is the
right time to invest.

1:00:03.940 --> 1:00:05.269
We'll put up a terrific resort.

1:00:05.671 --> 1:00:07.876
There's plenty of space,
the location is great.

1:00:08.144 --> 1:00:10.175
We'll tear all this down
and build it from scratch.

1:00:12.113 --> 1:00:14.410
I brought you this.
Just to start with.

1:00:17.481 --> 1:00:18.755
It's quite a number.

1:00:20.451 --> 1:00:21.824
Can we think it over?

1:00:22.453 --> 1:00:23.419
What's going on?

1:00:24.054 --> 1:00:25.421
I already gave you an advance.

1:00:26.193 --> 1:00:27.192
It's not about that.

1:00:28.734 --> 1:00:30.800
Okay. Okay, okay, well.

1:00:32.100 --> 1:00:33.198
I can raise the offer.

1:00:33.800 --> 1:00:35.101
I need time to think it over.

1:00:35.603 --> 1:00:37.807
Until I'll hear otherwise,
this place is still mine.

1:00:41.043 --> 1:00:42.306
You're
wasting my time.

1:00:42.675 --> 1:00:44.847
-What just happened?
-Oh, I'm sorry.

1:00:45.349 --> 1:00:47.410
I'm gonna call you soon,
in the next few days.

1:00:47.445 --> 1:00:48.785
Fucking asshole!

1:01:03.901 --> 1:01:06.033
You don't wanna
sell? What happened?

1:01:06.402 --> 1:01:08.200
I wanted to, but things change.

1:01:09.500 --> 1:01:10.807
Part of me wants to stay now.

1:01:11.376 --> 1:01:12.809
I feel like I'm finding my way.

1:01:13.311 --> 1:01:14.712
You couldn't wait to go home!

1:01:16.881 --> 1:01:18.012
This is where I feel at home.

1:01:20.247 --> 1:01:21.246
But she doesn't.

1:01:26.792 --> 1:01:27.725
What if I lose her?

1:01:28.893 --> 1:01:31.157
If you lose her going after what
you want,

1:01:31.192 --> 1:01:33.225
you would have lost her anyway.

1:01:34.525 --> 1:01:35.766
Think about it.

1:02:00.859 --> 1:02:01.858
Viv!

1:02:42.263 --> 1:02:43.328
Why are we here?

1:02:46.564 --> 1:02:47.970
So you can see for yourself.

1:02:51.602 --> 1:02:53.844
We used to sit here
together and draw.

1:02:58.477 --> 1:03:01.115
<i> He was way better</i>
<i>than me, always was.</i>

1:03:05.352 --> 1:03:07.990
<i>This was the kitchen.</i>

1:03:08.960 --> 1:03:10.322
<i>We used to have snacks here.</i>

1:03:13.492 --> 1:03:16.427
<i>We would measure each other,</i>
<i>kept track of our progress.</i>

1:03:17.628 --> 1:03:19.133
<i>He was green and I was purple.</i>

1:03:21.071 --> 1:03:22.103
<i>This was his bedroom.</i>

1:03:22.672 --> 1:03:24.908
<i>I used to love</i>
<i>playing hide and seek.</i>

1:03:25.510 --> 1:03:28.373
<i>I always hid under the</i>
<i>bed, hoping he'd find me.</i>

1:03:32.511 --> 1:03:34.445
I remember one time, we laid
together for hours

1:03:34.480 --> 1:03:35.886
without saying a word.

1:03:35.921 --> 1:03:38.119
Just looking at each other.

1:03:49.231 --> 1:03:50.362
This is where the fire came up.

1:03:55.171 --> 1:03:56.170
Roy was there.

1:03:57.074 --> 1:03:58.073
He saved me.

1:03:59.340 --> 1:04:00.669
He's always been there for me

1:04:00.704 --> 1:04:02.913
and I've always
been there for him.

1:04:04.642 --> 1:04:06.609
So was everything
you told me a lie?

1:04:07.579 --> 1:04:09.546
Did you even fall off your bike?

1:04:11.220 --> 1:04:13.319
New Jersey? Matching tattoos?

1:04:14.520 --> 1:04:17.422
So what, you You
did all this because

1:04:20.064 --> 1:04:22.526
you're still in love with him
and he's still in love with you?

1:06:08.832 --> 1:06:10.469
I've been looking
for you everywhere.

1:06:14.805 --> 1:06:16.013
I just

1:06:16.515 --> 1:06:17.740
I needed some time to think.

1:06:20.514 --> 1:06:22.118
I got a feeling
it's not about me.

1:06:25.321 --> 1:06:26.485
It's complicated, you know?

1:06:27.785 --> 1:06:28.784
No.

1:06:29.655 --> 1:06:30.654
It's not.

1:06:33.560 --> 1:06:34.559
You don't see me.

1:06:38.103 --> 1:06:39.135
You don't see me anymore.

1:06:42.569 --> 1:06:43.568
Cause you see me?

1:06:44.835 --> 1:06:46.043
Yes.

1:06:47.343 --> 1:06:48.342
I do.

1:06:51.512 --> 1:06:52.511
What do you see?

1:06:53.844 --> 1:06:55.151
A girl who's not happy.

1:06:57.716 --> 1:06:59.353
Because her happiness
is somewhere else.

1:07:13.864 --> 1:07:15.072
Where have you been?

1:07:17.571 --> 1:07:18.570
What's going on, Vivien?

1:07:22.411 --> 1:07:24.444
Can we please talk about it?
Tell me what's going on!

1:07:24.879 --> 1:07:26.182
Please, just talk to me!

1:07:26.877 --> 1:07:28.844
Viv! What did she tell you?

1:07:31.255 --> 1:07:32.188
You lied to me.

1:07:32.223 --> 1:07:34.586
You acted like
she was a complete stranger,

1:07:34.621 --> 1:07:37.292
you acted like you
didn't know her at all!

1:07:37.327 --> 1:07:39.228
She was acting like
she didn't know me!

1:07:39.263 --> 1:07:40.592
I was just trying to avoid her!

1:07:40.627 --> 1:07:42.396
I figured out it was the best
thing to do!

1:07:42.965 --> 1:07:44.398
Did you fuck her at that party?

1:07:44.433 --> 1:07:46.103
No! I would never fuck her!

1:07:46.338 --> 1:07:48.105
Whatever happened between us,
we were just kids!

1:07:48.707 --> 1:07:49.766
-Right.
-It was years ago!

1:07:50.435 --> 1:07:54.276
New Jersey and getting
matching tattoos together,

1:07:54.311 --> 1:07:56.608
that all happened
a really long time ago, right?

1:07:56.910 --> 1:07:58.577
Viv. We grew up together.

1:07:58.612 --> 1:08:00.612
She's obsessed with me,
she cannot let it go!

1:08:01.147 --> 1:08:02.845
But I already told her
a thousand times.

1:08:02.880 --> 1:08:05.320
I don't care about her,
I don't care!

1:08:06.521 --> 1:08:07.850
Please. Just give me some time.

1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:13.328
Just give me a moment, like
Let's talk about it.

1:08:13.930 --> 1:08:16.166
You had plenty of
time to talk about it.

1:08:17.268 --> 1:08:18.267
Let me go.

1:08:18.599 --> 1:08:19.664
Why?

1:08:20.469 --> 1:08:21.568
Why what?

1:08:21.604 --> 1:08:24.339
Why would you rather believe
a total stranger than me?

1:08:26.343 --> 1:08:29.608
-Maybe there's something else!
-Oh! Like what?

1:08:31.480 --> 1:08:33.447
Like you don't care
that much about me.

1:08:33.482 --> 1:08:35.185
You just wanna go home.

1:08:35.654 --> 1:08:37.649
First you tell me that I have to
follow my dreams,

1:08:37.684 --> 1:08:39.519
that I have to do the show.

1:08:39.554 --> 1:08:42.621
And now you're finding any
excuse to go back to New Jersey!

1:08:44.823 --> 1:08:46.790
And where is your home, Roy?

1:08:53.766 --> 1:08:54.831
You gave up on us.

1:08:55.801 --> 1:08:57.306
The moment you lied to me.

1:09:05.778 --> 1:09:07.349
Viv Viv, Viv, Viv, Viv!

1:09:08.814 --> 1:09:10.451
I meant it when I
asked you to marry me.

1:09:11.652 --> 1:09:13.223
I love you so much.

1:09:15.887 --> 1:09:16.919
Please don't go.

1:11:30.153 --> 1:11:31.526
I did it to save her.

1:11:32.628 --> 1:11:33.660
I never told anyone.

1:11:35.499 --> 1:11:36.795
So, that girl was Anna.

1:11:39.800 --> 1:11:40.799
Yes.

1:11:41.201 --> 1:11:43.802
It's all my fault. I
destroyed the barn.

1:11:44.137 --> 1:11:45.342
Stop it!

1:11:45.711 --> 1:11:48.103
You didn't destroy anything.
You saved her life.

1:11:48.638 --> 1:11:50.611
And that's the best thing
you could have done.

1:11:59.116 --> 1:12:00.654
What What are you doing?

1:12:00.689 --> 1:12:01.820
You helped me with the show.

1:12:02.289 --> 1:12:05.120
And I wanna try to
rebuild something.

1:12:06.530 --> 1:12:07.694
Starting with the old house.

1:12:09.434 --> 1:12:10.499
If that's okay with you.

1:12:10.534 --> 1:12:13.502
Okay. Oh

1:12:21.171 --> 1:12:23.138
You want her here,
with you, don't you?

1:12:25.043 --> 1:12:27.142
-Yeah.
-Then why did you let her go?

1:12:34.558 --> 1:12:35.755
I don't wanna stand in her way.

1:12:37.220 --> 1:12:38.758
How about getting
out of your own way?

1:12:39.527 --> 1:12:42.663
This pain you're feeling,
do something with it.

1:12:47.703 --> 1:12:48.735
Thank you.

1:14:03.009 --> 1:14:04.976
Hey. What's up?

1:14:05.847 --> 1:14:06.846
What are you doing here?

1:14:07.415 --> 1:14:09.211
I can't show these
pictures anymore.

1:14:10.819 --> 1:14:12.984
Come on, man. What do you mean?

1:14:13.186 --> 1:14:15.525
Everything's ready,
the opening is tomorrow!

1:14:16.461 --> 1:14:18.858
I just can't! These photos
don't represent me!

1:14:19.564 --> 1:14:20.596
They're not me!

1:14:20.631 --> 1:14:22.191
Look, you're just nervous.

1:14:22.493 --> 1:14:23.962
Everything will be fine.

1:14:24.965 --> 1:14:26.536
These are the wrong pictures.

1:14:26.571 --> 1:14:28.263
Roy, we're all set to go.

1:14:29.101 --> 1:14:30.232
We don't have the time.

1:14:32.203 --> 1:14:33.235
We have all night.

1:14:34.810 --> 1:14:35.809
Please.

1:14:45.315 --> 1:14:47.183
Hey. Do you want some coffee?

1:14:48.120 --> 1:14:49.823
No I'm I'm fine, thank you.

1:14:50.225 --> 1:14:51.286
Are you sure? That's fresh.

1:14:52.190 --> 1:14:53.189
Yeah, really. I'm fine.

1:14:58.163 --> 1:14:59.569
I remember you.

1:15:01.232 --> 1:15:03.738
You wouldn't remember me.
You were too young.

1:15:08.712 --> 1:15:11.746
I'm I'm looking
for Roy, is he here?

1:15:13.343 --> 1:15:15.585
No. He's at the gallery.

1:15:16.321 --> 1:15:18.016
He and Thomas haven't
come back yet.

1:15:18.051 --> 1:15:20.590
It happens a lot
the night before an opening.

1:15:24.354 --> 1:15:25.562
Must be really hard.

1:15:29.865 --> 1:15:30.765
What?

1:15:31.262 --> 1:15:32.294
Letting him go.

1:15:36.707 --> 1:15:37.904
Yeah.

1:15:38.806 --> 1:15:42.579
Sometimes, we have to suffer
for the good of other people.

1:15:44.275 --> 1:15:48.849
In the long run maybe we
realize it's better for us too.

1:18:55.565 --> 1:18:56.971
What are you doing here?

1:18:59.173 --> 1:18:59.974
Waiting for you.

1:19:04.882 --> 1:19:05.881
I'm

1:19:06.583 --> 1:19:08.378
I'm sorry, I just
didn't realize.

1:19:09.579 --> 1:19:10.787
What?

1:19:11.614 --> 1:19:12.954
How much you care about her.

1:19:14.254 --> 1:19:15.253
Now I know.

1:19:16.487 --> 1:19:17.519
It's too late for that.

1:19:19.490 --> 1:19:21.325
It's never too late
for someone you love.

1:19:21.894 --> 1:19:23.294
Look, Anna, I haven't slept.

1:19:23.329 --> 1:19:25.131
I still have to choose
the last photos and

1:19:25.933 --> 1:19:27.969
I turned everything upside down
last night.

1:19:29.434 --> 1:19:30.840
Why did you do all this?

1:19:32.470 --> 1:19:34.140
I'll tell you why,
you did it for her.

1:19:36.474 --> 1:19:38.474
But it won't do you any good
if she can't see it.

1:19:41.446 --> 1:19:42.852
Why don't you go to her?

1:19:45.516 --> 1:19:46.823
She doesn't want me anymore.

1:19:48.651 --> 1:19:50.959
Well, did you try everything
you could to get her back?

1:19:53.458 --> 1:19:54.457
No, you didn't.

1:19:55.159 --> 1:19:57.933
You'll never forgive yourself
if you don't get her back.

1:19:59.266 --> 1:20:00.562
I know this because

1:20:00.597 --> 1:20:03.037
I did everything I could
to get you back.

1:20:04.667 --> 1:20:06.106
And it's your turn now.

1:20:08.308 --> 1:20:09.604
We just have to learn to fly.

1:20:11.982 --> 1:20:13.344
I mean, you taught
me that, remember?

1:20:18.186 --> 1:20:19.218
She'll never forgive me.

1:20:20.650 --> 1:20:22.023
Roy, if you forgave me,

1:20:22.058 --> 1:20:24.058
I don't see why
she wouldn't forgive you.

1:20:33.168 --> 1:20:34.200
Now go.

1:20:36.666 --> 1:20:37.874
Go!

1:21:38.167 --> 1:21:39.100
You can't leave now.

1:21:39.135 --> 1:21:41.399
My flight leaves in
an hour, I have to go.

1:21:45.174 --> 1:21:47.273
You don't have to go,
you can stay here with me.

1:21:47.608 --> 1:21:48.703
I can't stay here with you.

1:21:50.443 --> 1:21:53.279
I have things to do, I have
something important to me.

1:21:53.781 --> 1:21:54.984
Does that matter?

1:21:55.646 --> 1:21:56.986
Obviously matters.

1:22:00.156 --> 1:22:01.254
I don't think it does!

1:22:04.754 --> 1:22:06.226
I came here for you!

1:22:09.297 --> 1:22:12.100
So you could sell the farmhouse,
money for school

1:22:12.135 --> 1:22:13.431
and now you change
your all mind!

1:22:13.933 --> 1:22:15.400
Now you want
something different!

1:22:15.835 --> 1:22:18.106
Every single time you want
something different,

1:22:18.141 --> 1:22:19.107
I never know!

1:22:20.638 --> 1:22:21.736
One minute you want one thing,

1:22:21.771 --> 1:22:24.112
the next minute something else.

1:22:24.147 --> 1:22:25.740
I'm always here
trying to play catch up!

1:22:35.752 --> 1:22:37.356
-Vivien, wait, wait, wait.

1:22:37.624 --> 1:22:39.358
-Listen to me.
-Why would I wait?

1:22:39.793 --> 1:22:40.726
Why would I listen?

1:22:40.761 --> 1:22:43.593
Every single time I
listen, you lie to me!

1:22:43.628 --> 1:22:45.496
Every single time!

1:22:48.798 --> 1:22:50.006
Look into my eyes.

1:22:52.637 --> 1:22:53.636
I know I lied to you.

1:22:55.673 --> 1:22:59.147
I didn't want to hurt you
and I've messed that up so bad.

1:23:00.480 --> 1:23:01.545
I messed up everything.

1:23:03.813 --> 1:23:04.779
This time, I won't.

1:23:09.522 --> 1:23:12.160
Just give me one hour.
I need one hour of your time.
