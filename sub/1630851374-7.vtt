12:47.183 --> 12:50.644
I-I really didn't expect it
to get that much traction. I...

12:50.686 --> 12:52.396
I seriously have, like,
12 followers.

12:52.438 --> 12:56.692
Actually, I wanted to discuss
something else with you.

12:56.734 --> 12:58.152
What's that?

12:58.194 --> 12:59.945
I'm sure you saw
Keith resigned.

12:59.987 --> 13:03.574
Which means I need to find
a new chief of detectives.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.576
I've been racking my brain
trying to figure out

13:05.618 --> 13:09.580
who the best person
for the job would be, and, uh...

13:09.622 --> 13:12.958
(laughs)
this might sound crazy,
but I think it's you.

13:14.168 --> 13:16.128
Me?

13:16.170 --> 13:18.130
Mm.

13:21.717 --> 13:24.470
Okay, I got it.
Excuse me?

13:24.512 --> 13:26.806
I've been watching
the news all morning.

13:26.847 --> 13:29.016
The department is under heat,
and you're trying to do

13:29.058 --> 13:31.393
damage control by promoting
your one Black detective.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.646
That's not true.
Come on.

13:33.687 --> 13:37.066
I am insanely underqualified,
and you know it.

13:37.107 --> 13:39.109
You're the best man for the job.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.403
That's all there is to it.

13:45.241 --> 13:50.204
Look, you really want me
to run things,

13:50.246 --> 13:53.749
then I can't give Keith
a paid vacation for what he did.

13:53.791 --> 13:56.126
He needs to be behind bars.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.420
He's already been
publicly humiliated.

13:58.462 --> 14:00.631
I think that's enough.
No, it's not.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.716
And I need you to know
that if I accept this position,

14:02.758 --> 14:06.095
the first thing I'm going to do
is put him on trial.

14:15.604 --> 14:18.023
Do what you like.
It's your department.

14:20.442 --> 14:23.445
If you want it.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.367
I want it.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.793
Hey, you got a minute?

14:37.835 --> 14:40.462
Sure, anything for the
Internet star Gene Clemens.

14:40.504 --> 14:44.133
Ah, some say Internet star,
some say chief of detectives.

14:44.174 --> 14:47.344
Shut up.
(laughs)
I know, right?

14:47.386 --> 14:49.263
Well, congratulations.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.681
Thank you. Thank you.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.224
Wow.

14:52.266 --> 14:55.227
So, um...
you like working here?

14:55.269 --> 14:57.187
Yeah, I love it.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.565
The uniform, the scenery.
Yeah.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.358
Going to bed
every night knowing

15:01.400 --> 15:03.360
I'm making a difference
in the world.
It's too bad.

15:03.402 --> 15:05.529
Because I want you to come back.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.824
Are you serious?

15:16.665 --> 15:19.877
You okay?

15:19.919 --> 15:22.838
Yeah, I just, um...

15:22.880 --> 15:26.425
I never thought
I'd hold one of these again.

15:30.679 --> 15:33.140
Oh, actually, uh,
that one's mine.

15:33.182 --> 15:35.851
I didn't get you one yet. I just
did that for the theatrics.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.353
No, I'm messing with you.
That's yours. I'm playing.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.730
(laughs)
Let's go.

15:39.772 --> 15:41.523
Let's go?

15:41.565 --> 15:42.816
You're just gonna leave now?
Don't you have to quit?

15:42.858 --> 15:44.735
My shift is pretty much over.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.695
Oh.
I can quit over the phone.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.239
I have a feeling you're gonna
like your first assignment.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.492
Yeah?

15:51.533 --> 15:53.118
(overlapping chatter)

15:53.160 --> 15:55.079
Hey, Chief.
Good to see you.
Yeah.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.580
You remember Detective Barnes?

15:57.539 --> 15:59.875
You fired me
for police misconduct?

15:59.917 --> 16:02.878
Yeah, look, I, uh, just got
to grab my stuff, all right?

16:02.920 --> 16:04.838
Not gonna be needing 'em.
You're under arrest

16:04.880 --> 16:06.799
for obstruction of justice
and evidence tampering.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.051
Seriously?
You have the right

16:09.093 --> 16:10.719
to remain silent.
Seriously? You're
gonna arrest me?

16:10.761 --> 16:12.388
Anything you say can
and will be used

16:12.429 --> 16:14.223
against you
in a court of law.

16:14.264 --> 16:16.183
You have the right
to have an attorney.

16:16.225 --> 16:18.143
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

16:18.185 --> 16:20.729
we will appoint you one.

16:20.771 --> 16:22.481
Why would he be
keeping her alive?

16:22.523 --> 16:25.192
MURPHY:
I don't know,
but we have to figure out

16:25.234 --> 16:26.777
where his guys
took Jess, so

16:26.819 --> 16:28.487
tell us where he lives.

16:28.529 --> 16:31.156
Oh, yeah,
that's a great idea.

16:31.198 --> 16:32.825
Ambush him at his house.

16:32.866 --> 16:34.952
Trey, what other choices
do I have? He's not answering

16:34.994 --> 16:37.746
his phone, the arcade
burned to the ground.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.999
I-I don't know
how else to talk to him.
Hey, you okay?

16:40.040 --> 16:42.376
LESLEY: Yeah.
MURPHY:
I need to talk to him.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.629
Uh, give me a second, guys.

16:45.671 --> 16:46.922
MURPHY:
If you hadn't told
that kid about our plan,

16:46.964 --> 16:48.340
Jess wouldn't even
be missing right now.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.300
You know that?

16:50.342 --> 16:53.053
So the least you can do
is tell us where Josiah lives.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.432
Fine. You can't go alone.
I'll come with you,

16:56.473 --> 16:58.475
but not if I'm not packing.

16:58.517 --> 17:03.230
Okay, um, my sister
has a gun, but...

17:03.272 --> 17:05.482
But what? Go get that.
Uh...

17:05.524 --> 17:07.234
No because what if you use it?

17:07.276 --> 17:08.736
Her...
It's registered in her name.

17:08.777 --> 17:11.030
If one of Josiah's boys
does have Jess,

17:11.071 --> 17:13.699
she doesn't have that much time.
Go get the gun.

17:13.741 --> 17:15.784
Yeah? Okay. Yeah.

17:15.826 --> 17:18.662
Okay.
Sorry. He's... high.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.630
Hey, listen,

17:28.672 --> 17:30.758
I'm really sorry
about what I did.

17:34.053 --> 17:38.766
I guess I just thought
that you were playing me,

17:38.807 --> 17:42.019
and I needed
to look out for myself.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.313
I wasn't.

17:44.354 --> 17:48.233
I wasn't playing you.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.362
I'm gonna make this right.

17:52.404 --> 17:54.948
Thanks.

17:56.533 --> 17:58.619
Here you go.

17:58.660 --> 18:01.330
Sorry. Here.

18:01.371 --> 18:03.457
Here.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.125
Um, don't tell Max
I gave it to you

18:05.167 --> 18:07.753
'cause I don't want him
to tell my sister, okay?

18:07.795 --> 18:10.422
All right, let's go.

18:10.464 --> 18:11.965
Come on.
(groans)

18:12.007 --> 18:13.759
MURPHY:
Max, we're leaving.
Oh, let's go.

18:13.801 --> 18:15.219
Pause. You're not coming.

18:15.260 --> 18:16.762
Why?

18:16.804 --> 18:18.472
Why do you think, skippy?

18:18.514 --> 18:20.265
Skippy? I'm not skippy.
What do you mean?

18:20.307 --> 18:21.767
Skippy? Do I seem skippy?

18:21.809 --> 18:23.018
I'm not skippy.
I'm chilly. I'm chillin'.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.978
I'm absolutely chilling.
Yeah.

18:25.020 --> 18:29.608
I'm ju... I'm perfectly ch...
uh, relaxed and fine. Guys.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.235
You're a disaster.

18:31.276 --> 18:34.279
Just stay here while
we go get Jess, dork.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.326
MURPHY:
Thanks.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.832
(doorbell rings)

18:49.753 --> 18:53.382
Hey... um...

18:54.508 --> 18:56.593
...is your dad home?

19:01.181 --> 19:04.017
My dad's not home, and I'm not
allowed to let strangers inside.

19:04.059 --> 19:06.145
We're not strangers.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.071
GIRL:
Mom? Mommy?

19:16.113 --> 19:17.489
Annie, come here, honey.

19:17.531 --> 19:18.824
There's no need
to panic.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.450
We just need to
talk to Josiah.

19:20.492 --> 19:21.493
Yeah, he's not home.

19:21.535 --> 19:23.036
I'll go look for him.

19:23.078 --> 19:24.288
We're the only ones here.

19:24.329 --> 19:25.956
Going somewhere?
Um...

19:25.998 --> 19:27.624
You said
we're meeting Daddy.

19:27.666 --> 19:29.877
Where are you meeting him?
LAUREN: I'm not.

19:29.918 --> 19:31.378
We just want to talk.
Call him now.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.172
Tell him
you're with Murphy Mason.

19:34.131 --> 19:37.885
Fine. Come on.

19:37.926 --> 19:39.970
Go. Go, go, go, go.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.140
Come on, Murphy.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.648
Stop! What the hell
are you doing?
(garbage disposal whirring)

19:51.690 --> 19:53.233
MURPHY:
What's that noise?

19:56.320 --> 19:58.322
He's not here.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.824
Yeah, I told you he isn't here.
Now get out of my house.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.951
Max, take the kids upstairs
and don't let them leave.

20:02.993 --> 20:04.578
No. Wait, wait.
Please don't. Please.

20:04.620 --> 20:05.746
No, guys, I think
we should just...
Just do it,

20:05.787 --> 20:07.289
Max.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.002
LAUREN:
D-Don't hurt them.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.587
I would never.

20:14.504 --> 20:17.216
It's okay. It's all right.
It's okay. It's fine.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.593
We're just gonna go
upstairs for a little bit.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.720
It's okay. Come on.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.016
Listen,

20:26.058 --> 20:28.101
my husband's a good man. I don't
know what you think he did,

20:28.143 --> 20:30.854
but...
He kidnapped my best friend,
and he's about to kill her.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.856
That's insane.
He wouldn't do that.
TREY: He's short

20:32.898 --> 20:34.149
on heroin.
That's how he operates.

20:34.191 --> 20:35.609
Now you just tell us
where he is,

20:35.651 --> 20:37.402
and we'll leave you alone.
I'm sorry, heroin?

20:37.444 --> 20:39.071
Yes, heroin. Surprise.

20:39.112 --> 20:40.822
He sells heroin for a living.
LAUREN:
No.

20:40.864 --> 20:42.616
He...
Your husband

20:42.658 --> 20:45.327
is the biggest drug dealer
in Chicago.

20:46.703 --> 20:48.747
Everything's okay,
you guys.

20:48.789 --> 20:52.209
We're just gonna hang out
in here for, like, ten minutes.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.127
Okay? While my friends

20:54.169 --> 20:55.671
talk to your mom.

20:59.800 --> 21:02.844
It's a cool room. Um...

21:04.763 --> 21:06.974
How does this work? Huh?

21:07.015 --> 21:09.601
Does it go on your head
like this? No.

21:09.643 --> 21:11.895
What about a shield?
(exhales sharply)

21:11.937 --> 21:14.898
No? Does it go
on the floor like this?

21:14.940 --> 21:16.275
Huh?

21:16.316 --> 21:18.360
Whoa! Whoa!

21:18.402 --> 21:20.654
(chuckles)
(laughing):
Oh, come on, I asked you

21:20.696 --> 21:23.073
how it worked. Come on, you got
to show me how to do it.

21:23.115 --> 21:26.201
Like this.
Okay.

21:30.831 --> 21:33.583
Uh, you don't have
to do that!

21:33.625 --> 21:35.544
I have a guy that comes.

21:35.585 --> 21:38.672
Well, can't just
sit inside, so...

21:40.757 --> 21:42.342
I can't believe I'm
stuck here with you.

21:42.384 --> 21:43.760
You're stuck here
because you OD'd

21:43.802 --> 21:46.221
on ADD meds.
You are such a moron.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.931
Why are you being so mean to me?

21:47.973 --> 21:50.100
I'm obviously
in a fragile state here.
You know what?

21:50.142 --> 21:52.060
You guys need to find somewhere
else to hide out. I'm done.
Cool.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.855
Thanks. You're unbelievable.
You know, yesterday,

21:54.896 --> 21:56.481
it was like, "Yeah, come in.
I'd love to help you out."

21:56.523 --> 21:59.651
Now...
(chuckles): Oh, my God.

22:00.610 --> 22:02.195
What?

22:02.237 --> 22:03.947
This is about Max.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.283
(scoffs)
What? No, it isn't.
Yeah.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.910
You were fine helping me when
you thought you could bone Max,

22:08.952 --> 22:10.996
but now that he
rejected you,

22:11.038 --> 22:12.247
you don't really want
to help me anymore.

22:12.289 --> 22:13.540
He didn't reject me.
(chuckles)

22:13.582 --> 22:14.958
Let me help you out here,

22:15.000 --> 22:17.753
Les, okay?
Max is in love with Murphy.

22:17.794 --> 22:19.671
Murphy is in love with Max.

22:19.713 --> 22:22.174
And there's nothing
either of us can do about it.

22:23.133 --> 22:24.259
"Either of us"?

22:24.301 --> 22:26.303
You. There's nothing you can do

22:26.345 --> 22:27.721
about it.

22:28.638 --> 22:29.639
Shut up. Shut up!

22:29.681 --> 22:31.141
No. That's... I...

22:31.183 --> 22:33.143
Seriously, I just said...
It doesn't...

22:33.185 --> 22:35.520
So, you were obviously
going to see Josiah.

22:35.562 --> 22:37.731
Just tell us where he is.
LAUREN:
I told you.

22:37.773 --> 22:40.359
I'm not letting you monsters
anywhere near my husband.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.486
(kids laughing, chattering)

22:44.946 --> 22:46.990
See?

22:47.032 --> 22:48.784
We're not monsters.

22:48.825 --> 22:51.203
Okay?

22:51.244 --> 22:52.662
We literally just need
an address

22:52.704 --> 22:54.414
before he kills another person.

22:54.456 --> 22:56.792
My husband's not a murderer.
I personally witnessed him

22:56.833 --> 22:57.876
kill at least ten people.

22:57.918 --> 22:59.503
I'm gonna ask you
a question.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.254
Are your kids allowed
at the arcade?

23:01.296 --> 23:02.923
No, right?

23:02.964 --> 23:04.674
And why-- why--

23:04.716 --> 23:07.386
wouldn't kids be allowed
at an arcade?

23:07.427 --> 23:10.347
I bet he doesn't
even want you there, huh?

23:10.389 --> 23:12.099
He says he's too busy,

23:12.140 --> 23:14.101

coming into the city.

23:14.142 --> 23:15.811
Yeah, well...

23:15.852 --> 23:18.230
Are you guys
struggling financially?

23:19.189 --> 23:21.691
Yeah, that's a no.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.151
I don't know,
how much do you think

23:23.193 --> 23:25.445
a crappy arcade makes?

23:25.487 --> 23:28.407
Ignorance is bliss, right?

23:29.366 --> 23:31.076
(chuckles softly)

23:31.118 --> 23:32.577
Come on.

23:32.619 --> 23:33.703
You're not gonna stab us.
LAUREN:
I will.

23:33.745 --> 23:35.247
Oh, she pulled a knife?

23:35.288 --> 23:36.540
A small one, too.
Not even the, uh...

23:36.581 --> 23:37.999
We don't have time
for this. Just tell us

23:38.041 --> 23:39.751
where he is.
I need the address.

23:39.793 --> 23:41.253
Just give us the address.

23:41.294 --> 23:42.379
Listen, lady,

23:42.421 --> 23:44.423
you heard my friend.

23:44.464 --> 23:47.217
We don't really have the time
for all this right now.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.344
Okay? So...

23:51.805 --> 23:53.723
We're gonna have to speed up
this process a little bit.

23:53.765 --> 23:56.351

Okay, it's been ten minutes.

I'm hungry.

24:18.206 --> 24:19.791
You know, when I was a kid,

24:19.833 --> 24:21.793
I had to spend a lot of time
in my room.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.129
Were you in trouble a lot?
No.

24:24.171 --> 24:26.047
It was just...

24:26.089 --> 24:27.841
My mom would send me
to my room a bunch.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.759
Why?

24:29.801 --> 24:31.261
Doesn't matter.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.055
Point is, is that I
learned to love it.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.892
Being in my room.
And you guys got all these toys,

24:36.933 --> 24:38.768
these video games.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.812
What's so bad?

Sometimes she just

24:45.150 --> 24:47.110
needed time without me.

24:47.152 --> 24:48.403
And when she did,

24:48.445 --> 24:49.988
she would just send me
to my room

24:50.030 --> 24:53.241
and tell me not to come
out till she said so.

24:56.161 --> 24:58.997
Kind of like now, I guess.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.019

want me to do?

That's what I'm doing.

34:09.756 --> 34:11.674
hiding out in a hotel,

34:11.716 --> 34:13.551
without even the decency

I have to get to her first.

I'm actually gonna murder her.

Can you just show me?

35:00.973 --> 35:03.142
He wants to talk to you
without me around.

35:11.150 --> 35:13.528
You know what I love?

35:13.569 --> 35:16.155
Having your ex-girlfriend
around to decode you.

35:16.197 --> 35:18.616
From now on,
can we just, like...

35:29.961 --> 35:32.755
Look, I'm really messed up.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.799
Oh. Okay...

35:34.841 --> 35:38.845
I have all of these
issues because my mom...

35:38.886 --> 35:41.764
Whoa, we're just diving
right into the deep end.

35:41.806 --> 35:43.891
(chuckles):
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.726
I guess we are.

35:45.768 --> 35:49.814
Anyway, I-I tend to go
after these, uh...

35:49.856 --> 35:52.024
these women that cause chaos,

35:52.066 --> 35:55.319
like she did.

35:55.361 --> 35:57.780
Like, I was sitting
in this room

35:57.822 --> 36:01.492
with these innocent kids who
were scared out of their minds

36:01.534 --> 36:03.119
because of Murphy.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.289
Just made me feel like
how I felt around my mom,

36:06.330 --> 36:07.999
I guess.

36:10.334 --> 36:12.503
I don't feel that way
around you.

36:12.545 --> 36:15.006
Thanks?

36:15.047 --> 36:16.924
I'm just trying to say that

36:16.966 --> 36:20.636
I like you.

36:20.678 --> 36:22.346
Well, you could have
just said that

36:22.388 --> 36:23.514
without the depressing
backstory.

36:23.556 --> 36:24.640
Oh, God.

36:41.282 --> 36:42.533
Can I help you?

36:44.368 --> 36:47.038
Uh, I'm looking
for Jessica Damon.

36:47.079 --> 36:49.624
Uh, I'm Jessica Damon.

36:49.665 --> 36:51.876
(scoffs)

36:51.918 --> 36:53.377
No, you're not.

36:58.925 --> 37:01.093
GENE:
This way, room 205.
Right here.

37:11.020 --> 37:14.815
Jessica Damon, come out
with your hands up!

37:18.903 --> 37:20.947
Who the hell are you?

37:20.988 --> 37:22.531
Jessica Damon.

37:22.573 --> 37:25.326
Oh, God.
Just bring her in.

37:25.368 --> 37:26.953
Go.

37:32.083 --> 37:36.212
(sighs):
Okay, let's try this
one more time.

37:36.254 --> 37:40.341
Just tell me where
you got this passport.

37:41.550 --> 37:43.970
This one, right here.

37:45.346 --> 37:46.305
Going once.

37:46.347 --> 37:48.849
Going twice.

37:48.891 --> 37:51.477
Nothing?
You sure?

37:53.145 --> 37:55.856
Fine.

38:05.658 --> 38:07.451
I promise I'm better
than that.

38:07.493 --> 38:10.454
Well, she's clearly terrified.

38:10.496 --> 38:13.791
How the hell did she
get Jess's information?

38:13.833 --> 38:18.045
MAX:
Wait, so Cindy is just
recycling our identities?

38:18.087 --> 38:20.381
We did not sign up for that.

38:20.423 --> 38:22.091
FELIX:
I can't think of
any other explanation.

38:22.133 --> 38:24.010
I mean, the police
arrested this girl,

38:24.051 --> 38:25.594
thinking it was Jess;
they wouldn't have done that

38:25.636 --> 38:28.055
if it was just
the same name.

38:28.097 --> 38:29.932
Wait, what if what happened
to that girl at the hotel

38:29.974 --> 38:31.475
is happening to Jess?

38:31.517 --> 38:33.269
Like, to our Jess.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.812
What?

38:34.854 --> 38:37.064
MURPHY:
That girl got Jess's
identity from Cindy.

38:37.106 --> 38:40.401
Jess got an identity
from Cindy, Jennifer Walker.

38:40.443 --> 38:42.820
We know Josiah didn't take her,
Sam is in prison.

38:42.862 --> 38:45.156
And Darnell called off
all-all of Nia's people.

38:45.197 --> 38:46.866
Maybe someone's
mistaking Jess

38:46.907 --> 38:48.075
for Jennifer Walker.

38:48.117 --> 38:51.537
(panting)

38:51.579 --> 38:54.623
She was obviously
in some sort of trouble

38:54.665 --> 38:56.667
if she needed a new identity.

38:58.586 --> 39:00.796
Think about it.

39:00.838 --> 39:04.342
Jess checked into the hospital
as Jennifer Walker.

39:04.383 --> 39:06.510
No, please don't.
I take it back.

39:06.552 --> 39:08.304
I won't say anything.
I won't...

39:08.346 --> 39:09.805
MURPHY:
And that's where
she was taken from.

39:09.847 --> 39:11.557
(screaming):
Please stop.

39:11.599 --> 39:13.267
You guys, I don't think
we're looking for someone

39:13.309 --> 39:16.103
who wants Jess.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.939
I think we might be
looking for someone

39:18.981 --> 39:20.775
who wants Jennifer Walker.
