Hey!

01:32.025 --> 01:34.289
Hi!
How are you?

01:51.444 --> 01:55.676
Welcome to "Bring Your Daughter To Work
Day" here at STARKe Pharmaceutical.

01:55.748 --> 01:59.240
[Man] Very nice.
Home movies and family photos.

01:59.319 --> 02:01.719
That's.... nice.
It's novel.

02:01.788 --> 02:05.155
Pat, this is just a first cut,
of course. It's--

02:05.225 --> 02:09.252
I was wondering how next month's
Good Chemistry video is coming along.

02:09.329 --> 02:13.493
- I can have it by Thursday.
- Pagel wants a look by Wednesday.

02:13.566 --> 02:16.501
- Gee, Wednesday would be--
- Perfect! Gotta run!

02:16.569 --> 02:20.903
This might be a good time to talk
about that promotion of mine.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.067
Or those
basketball tickets?

02:23.143 --> 02:25.577
All right.
We'll do it some other time.

02:27.247 --> 02:30.011
Okay, then.

03:05.118 --> 03:07.052
No.

03:18.131 --> 03:21.464
Hey, let me give you a hand.
Just hand me your staple gun.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.661
- The... what?
- The staple gun.

03:23.736 --> 03:29.072
- It's right behind you.
- Oh! Staple gun.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.940
Thank you.
You are really saving me here.

03:32.011 --> 03:34.809
You're welcome. I love this whole
"Choose Happiness" thing.

03:34.881 --> 03:38.715
Yeah. It's based on the
classic philosophical concept...

03:38.785 --> 03:42.016
that happiness is a choice,
not a condition.

03:46.192 --> 03:48.990
Maybe they're getting it
on a subliminal level.

03:52.532 --> 03:55.968
It's Joe, isn't it?
Joe... Scheffer.

03:56.035 --> 03:58.435
- Yeah.
- Meg Harper.

03:58.504 --> 04:01.996
You did that great video
for my department last summer.

04:02.075 --> 04:04.703
I know--

04:06.779 --> 04:09.873
[Laughs]
It actually, um-- It made me cry.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.975
Why?
'Cause it was so--

04:13.052 --> 04:15.816
[Clattering]

04:15.888 --> 04:19.846
- Bad?
- Not at all. Because it was so good!

04:19.926 --> 04:22.120
Thanks.

04:22.195 --> 04:26.325
- How have you been, Joe?
- I got a divorce, actually.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.890
Oh. Oh!

04:28.968 --> 04:32.495
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no. That's okay.

04:32.572 --> 04:36.599
- You all right?
- Yeah. You know, it's weird.

04:36.676 --> 04:38.871
No, but I'm doin' great.
I stay busy.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.039
During the week, it's all about
my daughter Natalie. She's 12.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.743
On the weekends, schedule's totally
whacked. I work out all the time.

04:44.817 --> 04:47.945
- Me too!
- I got concerts, plays.

04:48.021 --> 04:50.182
I hike now.
Got some Vibram sole boots.

04:50.256 --> 04:52.724
I do a little trekkin'.
I travel extensively.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.625
- Sounds like you win.
- I dance! Yeah.

04:55.695 --> 04:59.324
Not professionally, mind you, but
I do go to clubs with other-- others.

04:59.399 --> 05:01.663
Geez, Joe, get off your ass
and do something!

05:01.734 --> 05:04.498
- I'm thinking about
getting a pilot's license.
- I was kidding.

05:04.570 --> 05:06.663
- Oh! [Laughs]
- [Laughing]

05:06.739 --> 05:10.835
I'm not gonna take lessons.
Not gonna fly. I was joking too.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.845
Hey, I should buy you
an almond-spiced latte.

05:13.913 --> 05:16.541
It's the least I can do
for helping me with this--

05:16.616 --> 05:21.519
this whole--
with the banner.

05:21.587 --> 05:25.045
I got this work to do.
I should just finish my lunch.

05:25.124 --> 05:27.251
I understand completely.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.761
- Okay?
- Okay.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.261
[TV Announcer] Volomin,
from STARKe Pharmaceuticals.

05:44.243 --> 05:46.438
headaches, blurred or distorted
vision, loss of balance,

05:46.512 --> 05:48.844
dry mouth, numbness,
periodontal disease, lockjaw,

05:48.915 --> 05:50.883

and in extremely
rare cases... death.

06:00.326 --> 06:04.387
Volomin. Making you better
than you really are.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.976
[Natalie]
Daddy!

06:18.044 --> 06:19.978
Hey, Nat!

06:21.381 --> 06:23.611
Hi, Dad!

06:26.252 --> 06:29.346
- Yea!
- Oh! Mmm.

06:29.422 --> 06:31.583
Did you have fun?

06:31.657 --> 06:33.625
Weekend from hell.

06:33.693 --> 06:38.460
They took me to another
silly-ass hippie restaurant.

06:38.531 --> 06:41.625
- With the most absurd
one-man play ever produced.
- "Silly-ass"?

06:41.701 --> 06:44.329
- Dad!
-Just find an alternative.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.338
Geez.

06:47.840 --> 06:50.172
Everything on the menu
was made with curd.

06:50.243 --> 06:53.007
Curd this, curd that.
I ordered a hamburger,

06:53.079 --> 06:55.309
and I got a ten-minute lecture
on animal rights from the waitress.

06:55.381 --> 06:57.315
And the guy in the play
was half naked.

06:57.383 --> 07:00.216
- What? Which half?
- Dad!

07:00.286 --> 07:03.050
Did you get the T'wolves tickets?

07:03.122 --> 07:07.889
No, I didn't this time. The list
for company tickets is real long.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.224
- You know, I'm gonna get a promotion--
- Dad!

07:10.296 --> 07:12.856
The best view
is on TV anyway.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.833
- [Man Doing Voice Exercises]
- Rick's here.

07:15.902 --> 07:19.030
Mah, mah, mah, hah-mah.
Hah-mah, may, mee, mo, moo.

07:19.105 --> 07:22.802
Hey! There he is.
Hah-mah.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.776
You become a farmer?

07:25.845 --> 07:29.804
No, Joe, I'm an actor
dressed as a farmer for an audition.

07:29.882 --> 07:32.248
- Sorry.
- Come on, Nat, let's go.

07:32.318 --> 07:34.650
Hah, yah, yah, yah.

07:34.720 --> 07:37.883
- Hey, Joe.
- Hi, Callie.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.391
We had a great weekend.
Did she tell you about the play?

07:40.460 --> 07:42.394
Yeah.
The actors were naked.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.521
- So were the ushers.
- They were not!

07:44.597 --> 07:47.225
Callie, Beauty and the Beast is in town.
What's the matter with that?

07:47.300 --> 07:51.236
We're just trying to expose
Natalie to serious theater.

07:51.304 --> 07:55.206
- Bye, sweetie. Here's for lunch today.
- [Rick] Ooh-ahh.

07:55.274 --> 07:57.902
Thanks, Mom.

07:59.011 --> 08:00.876
Oops.

08:03.149 --> 08:05.811
[Rick]
I love your hair down. So sexy.

08:05.885 --> 08:10.254
- Stop. Really?
- So soft.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.848
We should probably get going.

08:12.925 --> 08:15.359
- Come on, Dad.
- Bye, Joe.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.760
- Bye.
- See you next weekend, sweetie.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.264
We're gonna see an authentic
Indonesian dance troupe.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.427
It's a dream come true, Mom.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.701
Dad.

08:30.810 --> 08:33.870
Why do I have to spend
weekends with them?

08:33.946 --> 08:37.039
Can't we just drive by
every Saturday and wave?

08:37.116 --> 08:41.746
Your mom's a little eccentric.
Think of her as an exotic flower.

08:41.821 --> 08:45.951
- And that made you what? Dirt?
- Nat, she's your mom.

08:46.025 --> 08:51.895
[Natalie] Let's get started on this
"Take Your Daughter to Work"thing.

08:51.964 --> 08:54.455
I'm supposed to interview you,
and then write a report for school.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.798
All right, let her rip.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.894
Okay. Ah--

08:58.971 --> 09:02.065
Did you always know you wanted to be
a video communications specialist?

09:02.141 --> 09:04.575
Actually, at first
I wanted to be Batman.

09:04.644 --> 09:07.169
But he had no powers.
AndAquaman-- I don't like water.

09:07.246 --> 09:09.908
So Spider-Man--
That's what I always wanted to be.

09:09.982 --> 09:13.816
- Dad, this is supposed to be serious.
- I really don't know what to say.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.354
I have a really great job.

09:16.422 --> 09:19.823
But to be honest, it's not the job
I've always dreamt about having.

09:19.892 --> 09:23.157
- I thought you wanted to be a writer.
- You're the writer, okay?

09:23.229 --> 09:27.689
I've read your play ten times. It's
amazing! How come you only wrote one?

09:27.767 --> 09:31.703
Writing was a dream I had
when I was a kid. And then I grew up.

09:33.339 --> 09:36.365
But dreams are important
to hold on to! Come on!

09:36.442 --> 09:39.969
You're gonna be a great writer.
You have that special spark.

09:40.046 --> 09:44.506
I knowthat, but that spark is gonna
go out unless you write. Now write this.

10:00.099 --> 10:03.694
- [Horn Honking]
- Hey, watch it, ass... guy.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.845
Nice save.

10:05.978 --> 10:08.776
- [Joe] You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

10:08.848 --> 10:11.646
- What's his hurry?
- He's just a lunatic.

10:13.886 --> 10:18.448
- It's so crowded.
- I think they manufacture people here.

10:18.524 --> 10:20.617
Below, in the basement,
they make people.

10:20.693 --> 10:24.424
- Look, look.
- Oh, wait, she's pulling out.

10:28.868 --> 10:31.837
[Horn Honking,
Brakes Squealing]

10:31.904 --> 10:34.702
- Hey! That guy's an ass-wipe!
- Natalie.

10:34.773 --> 10:37.765
Sorry.
I meant "ass-guy."

10:37.843 --> 10:39.868
That's Mark McKinney.

10:39.945 --> 10:42.106
He's a seven-year employee.

10:42.181 --> 10:44.115
What's he doing
in the ten-year lot?

10:44.183 --> 10:47.584
Maybe he's gonna stand around
for another three years.

10:47.653 --> 10:50.918
No, he's not.
I'll be right back.

10:52.458 --> 10:55.894
- Excuse me. Mark?
- Yeah?

10:55.961 --> 10:59.158
Yeah, this is a ten-year lot.

10:59.231 --> 11:02.223
And you're not a
ten-year associate, are you?

11:02.301 --> 11:04.701
- [Laughs] You're kiddin', right?
- No.

11:04.770 --> 11:06.931
No, this is actually
the ten-year lot.

11:07.006 --> 11:09.600
And this is the last space,
and if I don't park here...

11:09.675 --> 11:13.270
my daughter and I will have
to come way over from the west lot.

11:13.345 --> 11:16.075
- You actually brought
your daughter to work?
- Yeah.

11:16.148 --> 11:19.379
I thought only the mothers
were doin' that.

11:19.451 --> 11:23.251
I'd just appreciate it
if you'd park someplace else.

11:23.322 --> 11:25.552
You know
what I think, um--

11:25.624 --> 11:29.116
- What's your name again?
-Joe Scheffer. I work--

11:29.194 --> 11:31.924
Joe, I think walking
from the west lot...

11:31.997 --> 11:35.524
is probably better than getting your ass
kicked in front of your little girl.

11:35.601 --> 11:39.560
Wait a minute!
Are you like threatening to hit me?

11:41.774 --> 11:43.799
Tell you what, Joe.

11:43.876 --> 11:46.401
Uh-huh?

11:46.478 --> 11:48.139
I'm gonna give you to five
to get back in your car.

11:48.213 --> 11:49.703
No. I'm not gonna-- No.

11:49.782 --> 11:53.081
- No, this is the ten-year lot.
- One.

11:53.152 --> 11:57.054
- Two.
- Do you have any idea
of the crap I've been through--

11:57.122 --> 12:00.182
- Daddy!
- Stay in the car!

12:00.259 --> 12:03.092
Turn around,
and get back in your car.

12:03.162 --> 12:05.926
- That's my space!
- Daddy!

12:08.600 --> 12:11.433
Daddy! Daddy!

12:11.503 --> 12:14.666
- Leave him alone, dirtbag!
- Don't call anyone a dirtbag.

12:14.740 --> 12:17.937
- Daddy, you okay? You're bleeding.
- I'm good. I just tripped.

12:18.010 --> 12:20.877
I'm okay. Let's go.

13:15.868 --> 13:19.736
I think maybe I'm just
gonna take you to school.

13:30.682 --> 13:33.674
- [Phone Ringing]
- [Glass Falls To Floor]

13:33.752 --> 13:35.743
[Coughs]

13:35.821 --> 13:38.255
[Joe OnAnswering Machine]
You've reached the Scheffers.

13:38.323 --> 13:41.053
[Natalie On Answering Machine]
Wait for the beep.

13:41.126 --> 13:43.754
[Natalie]
Dad, pick up.

13:43.829 --> 13:46.195
Dad, it's been two days.

13:47.933 --> 13:49.867
- Hey!
- Dad?

13:49.935 --> 13:51.527
Are you okay?

13:51.603 --> 13:55.198
- Yeah, I'm great.
- You don't sound great.

13:55.274 --> 13:57.538
Mom and Rick have friends
over for yoga.

13:57.609 --> 14:01.170
So I can sneak out
and be home in no time.

14:01.246 --> 14:05.046
No, Nat.
Um, I got, um--

14:05.117 --> 14:07.381
Friends from--
We got a bunch--

14:07.453 --> 14:11.048
- We're gonna edit--
- Dad, just tell me something.

14:11.123 --> 14:14.286
Is it you don't wanna see me?
Or is it you don't want me to see you?

14:16.695 --> 14:18.629
Yes, to the second one.

14:18.697 --> 14:20.688
Dad, please just let me
come over,

14:20.766 --> 14:23.633
-just for a little while.
- It's okay. Everything's all right.

14:23.702 --> 14:27.160
I'm just sittin' here
drowning my sorrows in a--

14:27.239 --> 14:29.969
a quart of Ben and Jerry's
Chunky Monkey.

14:30.042 --> 14:32.704
So, let's see.

14:32.778 --> 14:36.077
Either you're lying
or you've grown an ovary.

14:36.148 --> 14:39.584
How old are you again?

14:39.651 --> 14:42.518
Dad, I'm scared.

14:42.588 --> 14:45.887
What are you scared of?

14:45.958 --> 14:49.860
I'm not sure.
I just miss you.

14:49.928 --> 14:54.160
It's gonna be okay, Natalie,
I promise. It's gonna be fine.

14:56.568 --> 15:00.265
Okay.
Your turn.

15:00.339 --> 15:03.433
What are you scared of?

15:05.477 --> 15:07.479
Disappearing, I think.

15:07.479 --> 15:08.173
Disappearing, I think.

15:16.655 --> 15:19.021
- [Knock On Door]
- [Gasps] Hang on a second!

15:19.091 --> 15:21.059
Hang on!

15:22.594 --> 15:24.528
Hi.

15:24.596 --> 15:26.621
[Sniffing]
Are you smoking?

15:26.698 --> 15:31.397
Please. Like the coordinator of the
company wellness program would smoke!

15:31.470 --> 15:33.199
Right!

15:33.272 --> 15:36.400
You should've come with me
to the Human Resources Conference.

15:36.475 --> 15:41.708
Hawaii... was amazing.
I brought you a little... something.

15:41.780 --> 15:45.739
"George Kahumoku, Jr.
Sings Hawaiian Love Songs."

15:45.817 --> 15:48.615
- You don't have it, do you?
- No!

15:48.687 --> 15:52.589
I'm gone for three days and employees
are fighting like schoolkids in the lot.

15:52.658 --> 15:56.253
This McKinney, I know everybody hates
that big jerk. But this Joe "Shepherd"--

15:56.328 --> 15:58.990
- Scheffer.Joe Scheffer.
- Scheffer.

15:59.064 --> 16:01.794
He did the video
for the wellness program last year.

16:01.867 --> 16:03.926
- Remember?
- Oh, he's the A-V guy.

16:04.002 --> 16:07.836
- Video communications specialist.
- Ooh! That's very different then.

16:07.906 --> 16:12.104
Actually, Jeremy,
he's a good guy.

16:12.177 --> 16:16.273
I ran into him the other day.
He's quiet, hard-working.

16:16.348 --> 16:18.908
Maybe a little shaky right now.
He's going through a divorce.

16:18.984 --> 16:22.442
It's really sad.
He kept telling me how great--

16:22.521 --> 16:25.354
Any work-related problems
prior to the incident?

16:25.424 --> 16:28.416
He was promised a promotion
almost a year ago, and never happened.

16:28.493 --> 16:31.360
So, basically,
he's a schmuck.

16:31.430 --> 16:34.024
The guy's a devoted father,

16:34.099 --> 16:35.760
a hard worker
with nothing but positive reviews.

16:35.834 --> 16:37.768
That makes him a schmuck?

16:37.836 --> 16:40.396
His wife left him.
He was passed over for a promotion...

16:40.472 --> 16:42.463
and he just got bitch-slapped
in the company parking lot.

16:42.541 --> 16:45.704
I'm gonna go with...
yeah!

16:47.012 --> 16:49.276
So, what are we doin' about it?

16:49.348 --> 16:52.784
Well, "we" have left him several
messages. I'm waiting to hear back--

16:52.851 --> 16:55.376
Whoa. That's not enough.
It's been three days.

16:55.454 --> 16:58.150
We're under review.
The efficiency Nazis are all over us.

16:58.223 --> 17:01.351
Employees fighting in the
parking lot sort of undercuts...

17:01.426 --> 17:03.860
the company wellness program,
if you know what I mean.

17:03.929 --> 17:07.830
-Do you think I'm not doing my job?
-It doesn't matter what I think.

17:07.898 --> 17:10.628
But what if he decides to sue?
What if he sues the living daylights...

17:10.702 --> 17:13.829
out of the company for failure
to create a safe work environment,

17:13.905 --> 17:17.396
or, uh, uh, emotional distress?

17:17.476 --> 17:21.640
But you and me, Meg...
Megs, we're on the same page.

17:21.713 --> 17:24.011
We're the "A" team. We can
make this go away. I know we can.

17:24.082 --> 17:26.642
- I'll call him again.
- Nope. That time has passed.

17:26.718 --> 17:28.845
- You go get Joe "Schlepper."
-Joe Scheffer.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.650
- Go get him? At his house? Go--
- Go get him. At his house.

17:31.723 --> 17:35.181
Go get him at his house and bring him
back to work. I know you can do it.

17:36.928 --> 17:39.920
- Megs? Yeah, go get him.
- Yeah? Yeah.

17:39.998 --> 17:42.228
Bye-bye.

18:09.594 --> 18:11.619
[Fly Buzzing]

18:14.533 --> 18:16.057
Hi, Joe.

18:16.134 --> 18:19.433
Have you, uh, left the house at all
in the past three days?

18:19.504 --> 18:23.065
- I had some cleaning to do.
- Mm-hmm. I can see that.

18:23.141 --> 18:25.939
Is that--
It's bleach, huh?

18:26.011 --> 18:28.411
It's the only thing
that really gets the stains out.

18:28.480 --> 18:33.577
- Would you hold that for a minute?
- Sure. Um, Joe.

18:33.652 --> 18:36.416
We'd really like for you
to come back to work.

18:36.488 --> 18:38.547
You and I can work through
this thing together.

18:38.623 --> 18:41.319
Do you think this will dry
darker than the rest of the ceiling?

18:41.393 --> 18:45.090
If this drys darker,
then I'm gonna notice this stain.

18:45.163 --> 18:47.097
I'm always gonna look at this stain.

18:47.165 --> 18:49.895
I'd have to paint the whole ceiling.
I might as well do that right now.

18:49.968 --> 18:53.734
Joe, could you please
slow down for a minute?

18:53.805 --> 18:57.332
I would really like
to talk to you about this.

18:57.409 --> 19:00.344
- What's in the bag? Is that bottles?
- No!

19:03.715 --> 19:06.081
Oh!
I'm gonna need more bleach.

19:06.151 --> 19:09.279
- [Vacuum Whirring]
- I would really like to help you.

19:17.162 --> 19:19.460
Please...Joe.

19:24.302 --> 19:27.032
He took something from me.

19:27.105 --> 19:30.268
Your parking space.

19:30.342 --> 19:35.837
But it's not exactly your parking
space that he took, is it, Joe?

19:35.914 --> 19:39.680
Yes, it's exactly that.
It's my parking space.

19:39.751 --> 19:43.346
How 'bout when you come back to work,
we give you an assigned space, huh?

19:43.422 --> 19:45.788
- I can't go back.
- Why not, Joe?

19:45.857 --> 19:48.189
Would you mind not saying
my name so much?

19:48.260 --> 19:50.251
Maybe you could just come in
for a couple of hours--

19:50.328 --> 19:52.762
I'm sorry... I can't.

19:52.831 --> 19:56.198
- McKinney's been suspended, Joe.
- You said my name again.

19:56.268 --> 20:01.365
Fine! Okay, fine. I will never
say your name again... ever.

20:01.440 --> 20:05.308
Look, McKinney's not coming
back for a few weeks, Joe.

20:05.377 --> 20:09.507
Then he has to attend my five-step anger
diffusion workshop called"RELAX."

20:09.640 --> 20:11.904
- That stands for Releasing--
- It doesn't matter.

20:11.976 --> 20:17.039
No. Regulating Emotional
Levels And-- "X." What the hell is "X"?

20:17.115 --> 20:20.414
- I'm not comin' back.
- Do you think--

20:20.485 --> 20:24.114
-It doesn't matter what you say.
-Oh, geez! What do you want?

20:24.188 --> 20:26.520
Oh.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.926
I'm sorry.

20:33.698 --> 20:36.496
Did you say,
"What do you want?"

20:36.567 --> 20:39.900
I'm taking this too personally.

20:39.971 --> 20:45.102
Things have been really difficult
in our department, and I need--

20:45.176 --> 20:48.577
What do I want?
[Muttering]

20:48.646 --> 20:51.479
I need you to come back.

20:51.549 --> 20:54.074
- [Panting]
- Joe?

20:56.487 --> 20:59.684
- [Hyperventilating]
-Joe?

20:59.757 --> 21:02.282
You're having a panic attack.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.523
Joe, do you know
what that means?

21:05.596 --> 21:08.497
It... sounds...
pretty self-explanatory.

21:08.566 --> 21:13.003
Okay. It's just--
It's a chemical misfire.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.772
You're not dying, Joe.

21:17.842 --> 21:20.037
Ten years in
a goddamn cubicle.

21:20.111 --> 21:23.205
Then you wake up one day,
and then--

21:23.281 --> 21:27.217
And I don't have
a place to park.

21:30.721 --> 21:33.383
What can I do for you, Joe?

21:39.597 --> 21:41.827
Nothing.

21:44.635 --> 21:47.399
[Announcer] Zylol--
From STARKe Pharmaceuticals.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.463
For the best you can be.

21:49.540 --> 21:54.341
Possible side effects
may include nausea, drowsiness,

21:54.412 --> 21:59.372
dry throat, cough,
unexpected gas--

22:03.754 --> 22:07.383
What do you want?

22:09.760 --> 22:12.627
[Vomiting]

22:17.135 --> 22:20.536
Okay, now what do you want?

22:21.973 --> 22:24.168
Aah.

22:38.456 --> 22:41.357
God, tell me
you didn't bleach yourself.

22:41.425 --> 22:43.723
Just the shirt.
Coffee?

22:43.794 --> 22:46.854
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:56.841 --> 22:59.674
Joe, have you ever heard
of manic depression?

22:59.744 --> 23:03.475
Yeah.
[Laughing Hysterically]

23:05.183 --> 23:06.946
Whoo-ooo-ooo!

23:07.018 --> 23:11.045
See, this--
This is way out of my league.

23:11.122 --> 23:14.956
And what I do have
is the number of a great psychiatrist.

23:15.026 --> 23:18.962
No, I'm cured!

23:19.030 --> 23:21.828
Okay, right. She's probably
in the office this morning--

23:21.899 --> 23:27.303
- Meg! Oh, this is-- You cured me!
- I cured you?

23:27.371 --> 23:31.239
Yes! When you asked me that
question that scared me so much
that I almost passed out.

23:31.309 --> 23:36.679
For the first time since I can remember,
I have an answer. I know what I want!

23:36.747 --> 23:39.238
- And it's all thanks to you.
- Excellent.

23:42.787 --> 23:48.020
[Exhales] I am gonna kick
Mark McKinney's ass! Yeah!

23:50.561 --> 23:54.088
- [Jeremy] You gotta be kidding.
- [Meg] But he wants to do it.

23:54.165 --> 23:56.099
[Jeremy] Scheffer's gonna
come back for seconds?

23:56.167 --> 23:58.397
McKinney smacked him all over
the lot, for Christ's sake.

23:58.469 --> 24:00.733
- Well, that's sensitive.
- I'm sensitive.

24:00.805 --> 24:04.332
I like herbal tea and Deepak Chopra
and people who come back to work.

24:06.110 --> 24:10.274
He's gonna come to his senses,
right, Meg? He's not gonna fight.

24:10.348 --> 24:14.614
Meg! Besides, it's not like
he knows where McKinney lives.

24:17.555 --> 24:19.216
Aah! Aah!

24:23.928 --> 24:26.795
Damn it!

24:26.864 --> 24:28.855
You don't have a gun, do you?

24:28.933 --> 24:32.801
I didn't come over here to shoot you.

24:32.870 --> 24:35.065
If you're here to threaten a lawsuit,
my attorney tells me...

24:35.139 --> 24:37.471
I can keep you tied up--
I'm not here to sue ya.

24:37.541 --> 24:40.704
You took something of mine.
I want it back.

24:40.778 --> 24:45.010
When your suspension's over,
I wanna fight you again.

24:45.082 --> 24:47.346
You're all hopped up
on samples, aren't ya?

24:47.418 --> 24:49.909
What are you on?
Zylol? Volomin?

24:49.987 --> 24:52.012
I'm not on anything!
I just know what I want.

Don't you have school today?

took it easy on you, right?

What makes you think he
won't kill you this time?

- Dad!
- You made your point.

26:08.466 --> 26:11.128
- Good.
- It's my turn.

26:11.202 --> 26:12.897
I don't want you
skipping school anymore.

26:12.970 --> 26:16.804
- Just biology lab. I can make it up.
- It's not just a biology lab.

26:16.874 --> 26:18.808
It's a choice that'll affect
the rest of your life.

26:18.876 --> 26:21.071
First you skip biology.

26:21.145 --> 26:22.908
Then you don't get in the
right college, then you end up--

26:22.980 --> 26:26.643
Then you're a middle-aged guy
fighting in the parking lot at work?

26:39.764 --> 26:43.393
Miss Scheffer,
you missed fourth period again.

26:43.467 --> 26:45.697
Funny thing.

26:45.770 --> 26:49.262
You might have gotten away with it
if not for these little disappearances.

26:49.340 --> 26:52.867
- Gotten away with?
- Blending in.

26:52.943 --> 26:56.379

- Could you sit up?

26:56.447 --> 26:59.143
Go on!

26:59.216 --> 27:02.344
Hiding in the back of the classroom,
not speaking up. What, just skating by?

27:02.420 --> 27:05.048
- Is this about my grades?
- Yes, it is.

27:05.122 --> 27:08.558
I just pulled your elementary
school records. What did I find?

27:08.626 --> 27:11.459
StraightA's
right down the line, baby girl.

27:11.529 --> 27:14.555
Advanced courses
in math and English.

Still trying to find the art fair,

27:16.267 --> 27:19.202
spelling bee or writing
competition you didn't win?

27:19.270 --> 27:23.206
I was an overachiever. I'm settling
into my natural groove now.

27:23.274 --> 27:26.243
But you just couldn't "vanilla down"
the writing, could you?

27:26.310 --> 27:28.642
In my 15 years as a counselor,

27:28.712 --> 27:31.408
I have never seen writing
like yours from a 12-year-old.

27:31.482 --> 27:34.417
Look at me.

27:34.485 --> 27:37.318
I understand you were invited to write
for the theater club and you said no.

27:39.156 --> 27:44.219
- What are you afraid of?
- Dogs. Not all dogs--

27:44.295 --> 27:46.388
How are things at home, Natalie?

27:54.805 --> 27:57.273
- See you, Meg.
- Bye.

- Hey, Neva. Who's in there? Really.
-Joe Scheffer.

28:04.782 --> 28:06.579
Everybody is talking about this.

- It is all over campus.
- Thanks.

[Jeremy] There are plenty of people
I'd like to slap around.

28:11.622 --> 28:13.647
We all have those feelings,
but we suppress them.

28:13.724 --> 28:15.954
Then we go home and we drink.
That's what separates us from animals.

28:28.105 --> 28:31.905
Joe here issued a physical
challenge to Mark McKinney.

28:31.976 --> 28:35.241
But now, now he's come
to his senses. Right, Joe?

28:35.312 --> 28:37.746
Joe?

28:38.983 --> 28:41.713
I can see how goin' to his house
was a mistake.

28:41.785 --> 28:44.879
- Whoa.
- I stepped over the line.

28:44.955 --> 28:47.480
How do I know he didn't
go easy on me the first time?

28:47.558 --> 28:50.527
That's right.
We can fix this, Joe.

28:50.594 --> 28:53.586
Let's get Mark on the phone and put
an end to this nonsense right now.

28:53.664 --> 28:56.064

28:57.134 --> 28:59.068
- You okay?
- Yeah, I--

28:59.136 --> 29:01.001
I could use a drink actually.

29:01.071 --> 29:03.665

- Scotch and water.

Just water.

30:02.739 --> 30:04.673
All right,
look out now.

30:04.741 --> 30:06.766
- Cade Raymond.
- Cade, how are you doing?

30:06.843 --> 30:08.333
Good, good. You know what?

30:08.412 --> 30:10.880
I'm calling your fight
"The Thrilla in Vanilla."

30:10.947 --> 30:12.915
Vanilla?
[Laughing]

30:12.983 --> 30:15.747
- Get it?
- No.

30:15.819 --> 30:17.878
Couple suburban white guys.

30:17.954 --> 30:22.687
- Huh?
- Oh, yeah.

30:22.759 --> 30:25.091
Hey, Joe?

30:25.162 --> 30:27.892
- You like squash?
- With butter and brown sugar? You bet!

30:27.964 --> 30:31.092
Because I need a partner
tomorrow at 5:00.

30:31.168 --> 30:34.604
- Oh, squash squash!
- You know. Up at Club 13.

30:34.671 --> 30:37.196
- Club 13.
- You never been up there.

30:37.274 --> 30:39.572
- You know, I get busy downstairs.
-Joe, my man.

30:39.643 --> 30:42.237
We've got to fix that. Huh?

30:42.312 --> 30:44.246
- You're kidding.
- You can play, right?

30:44.314 --> 30:46.680
- Yeah.
- Cool, cool. 5:00.

30:46.750 --> 30:48.684
You the man.

30:48.752 --> 30:52.415
- You the man!
- Yeah.

30:52.489 --> 30:55.652
I've got my money
on Joe Scheffer.

31:01.264 --> 31:04.665
Man.

31:10.774 --> 31:13.038
Great. Uh, Mark,
Joe's here now.

31:13.110 --> 31:14.873
Oh, all right, I get it.

31:14.945 --> 31:17.539
You wanna back out.
Probably wanna be best friends.

31:17.614 --> 31:22.210
Mark, what I want
is for you to remember the fight.

31:22.285 --> 31:26.984
Right? Three weeks,
the ten-year parking lot at 8:00 a.m.

31:27.057 --> 31:29.355
- You got it?
- [Mark] Bring it on.

31:29.426 --> 31:33.294
No, no, M-Mark?
Mark? Wow.

31:37.100 --> 31:39.796
[Horn Honking]

32:17.741 --> 32:19.834
You comin' or goin', dude?

32:19.910 --> 32:25.348
I was just driving by to take--
you know-- To find out more--

32:25.415 --> 32:28.043
- Somethin' bad happen to ya?
- No, no, no, no, no.

32:28.118 --> 32:32.919
I thought it just is a great time
for me to take a self-defense class.

32:32.989 --> 32:35.685
- You got your ass kicked, huh?
- Who told you?

32:35.759 --> 32:37.818
- You didn't read about it in the paper?
- What?

32:37.894 --> 32:40.761
Front page.
Daily Wuss.

32:40.830 --> 32:44.095
Come on. Guys who get their asses
kicked, that's 90%of my business.

32:44.167 --> 32:46.362
Come on in.
Come on.

32:52.609 --> 32:54.907
- Is this you?
- Yeah.

32:54.978 --> 32:57.503
Maximum Punishment.

32:57.581 --> 32:59.913
- That looks good.
- No,

32:59.983 --> 33:02.645
maximum punishment
was watching the damn thing.

33:08.458 --> 33:11.154
- Tom Sawyer?
- Loose adaptation.

33:11.228 --> 33:14.425
Tom played a rival ninja.
I killed him.

33:14.497 --> 33:17.295
- What happened?
- I don't know.

33:17.367 --> 33:20.302
The producer had foreign distribution--
35% he'd charge:

33:20.370 --> 33:22.895
"Oh, I need the money for my wife!
I have a house in Las Brisas."

33:22.973 --> 33:25.339
No, no, I mean, you know.
What happened?

33:25.408 --> 33:27.569
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

33:29.346 --> 33:33.077
Come on, I wanna hear
a really sad story.

33:33.149 --> 33:35.083
Yours.

33:35.151 --> 33:38.052
I, um-- I got beat up...

33:38.121 --> 33:41.648
in front of my 12-year-old daughter
and a bunch of coworkers.

33:43.593 --> 33:45.527
[Sighs]
Damn.

33:45.595 --> 33:49.156
- Yeah.
- I was really hoping to give a shit.

33:49.232 --> 33:51.996
Yeah.

33:52.068 --> 33:54.002
- What?
- You got your ass kicked.

33:54.070 --> 33:58.598
Now you wanna get all Bruce Lee
and stuff. You're losin' me.

33:58.675 --> 34:01.610
Hey, I didn't come over here
to have my angst reviewed...

34:01.678 --> 34:03.612
by some has-been movie star.

34:03.680 --> 34:07.343
Ooh! 'Angst reviewed, "
"movie star"in the same sentence.

34:07.417 --> 34:09.476
You must be very proud
of yourself...

34:09.552 --> 34:12.112
for a man who just got made
into a wimp in front of his daughter.

34:12.188 --> 34:15.783
Why don't you
just shut up?

34:15.859 --> 34:18.327
Why don't you
come over here and make me?

34:18.395 --> 34:20.989
[Sighs]

34:21.063 --> 34:22.827
Huh?

34:25.368 --> 34:27.233
Come on.

34:30.473 --> 34:34.034
- I figure I got it comin'.
- You don't think I'll do it, do you?

34:36.379 --> 34:38.313
- [Yells]
- [Groans]

34:38.380 --> 34:40.576
- Geez, I'm sorry.
- [Gagging]

34:40.650 --> 34:43.983
I'm really torqued, man.
I didn't mean that to hurt.

34:44.054 --> 34:46.648
Are you all right?
Take a deep one, man.

34:46.723 --> 34:50.284
That's it.Just draw it in, dude.
You'll be all right.

34:50.360 --> 34:55.263
- [Coughing]
-Jesus. I'm really sorry, man.

34:55.331 --> 34:56.764
Let me give you a free lesson.

34:56.833 --> 34:58.733
My way of saying,
"Don't press charges."

35:20.423 --> 35:22.789
Mr. Scheffer?
Welcome to Club 13.

35:22.859 --> 35:24.622
Follow me.

35:24.694 --> 35:27.219
- Did you bring your own equipment?
- Was I supposed to?

35:27.297 --> 35:29.595
No, not a problem.
We've got everything you need.

35:29.666 --> 35:32.328
[Joe]
Great. Load me up.

35:41.778 --> 35:44.872
Holy crap! Dude,
the hockey rink's next door.

35:44.948 --> 35:47.746
Yet somehow
it works for ya.

35:47.817 --> 35:50.877
- Hey, it's my partner you're
talking about. Joe Scheffer.
- Hey, Cade.

35:50.954 --> 35:52.888
- I'm Peter.
- Hello, Peter.

35:52.956 --> 35:54.890
- I'm Peter too.
- Two Peters.

35:54.958 --> 35:58.291
- Actually it'd be four peters.
- [Men Laugh]

35:58.361 --> 36:00.886
- All right, Joe. We're serving.
- Good, okay.

36:00.964 --> 36:03.956
- Over here.
- Right. From here in the red thing.

36:13.643 --> 36:16.339
I haven't played
since, you know...yesterday.

36:30.427 --> 36:33.123
- [Shouts]
- You okay?

36:33.196 --> 36:35.994
Yeah. It's a little longer
than I'm used to.

36:36.065 --> 36:38.761
All right.

36:41.871 --> 36:44.032
- I think it's dead.
- That's pretty funny.

36:44.107 --> 36:46.200
Maybe I should serve first.

36:46.276 --> 36:49.268
All right, gentlemen,
here we go. Let's get it on.

36:57.353 --> 37:00.117
Okay, that's six-one.

37:00.190 --> 37:02.055
Your Zen approach
is really workin'.

37:02.125 --> 37:06.323
Don't be fooled now. First he gets
inside your head, then it's all action.

37:08.131 --> 37:11.066
Ow! Ow! Oh!

37:11.134 --> 37:13.500
##Give the past the slip ##

37:13.570 --> 37:17.870
Ooh! Nice stop, Joe.

37:17.941 --> 37:21.877
- You must have balls of steel.
- [Clinking Sound]

37:23.546 --> 37:26.743
##Now whip it
into shape ##

37:26.816 --> 37:28.647
##Shape it up ##

37:28.718 --> 37:31.516
##Get straight
Go forward ##

37:31.588 --> 37:34.421
##It's not too late
to whip it ##

37:34.491 --> 37:36.982
## Whip it good ##

37:42.098 --> 37:44.259
Looks like you need some
work on your forehand.

37:44.334 --> 37:49.067
But I do have that "balls of steel"
thing goin' on, right?

37:49.138 --> 37:51.197
Scheffer,
you are one funny guy.

37:51.274 --> 37:54.266
You think that's funny? Wait till
they bill us for that display case.

37:54.344 --> 37:57.177
- [Everyone Laughing]
- Come on, let's play.

37:59.282 --> 38:01.716
##I say whip it ##

38:01.784 --> 38:04.753
## Whip it good ##

38:06.856 --> 38:10.952
- They're killin' us.
-Joe, game point. Let's do this.

38:32.448 --> 38:34.313
Yeah!

38:34.384 --> 38:37.410
Did you see that?

38:41.324 --> 38:45.784
- Great shot!
- That was amazing! Good save.

38:45.862 --> 38:47.796
We gotta do this again.

39:03.112 --> 39:05.307
- [Cade] Abby Manheim.
- Yeah.

39:05.381 --> 39:08.350
- I'll be seein' you Friday night.
- Friday night?

39:08.418 --> 39:10.978
Yeah, we're celebrating Abby's
five-year anniversary with the company.

39:11.054 --> 39:13.852
A little karaoke thing.
Countin' on you bein' there.

39:13.923 --> 39:17.654
- You are?
- You kiddin' me? You're Joe Scheffer.

39:21.230 --> 39:23.198
And finally, how does it feel...

39:23.266 --> 39:26.702
to have created one of the most
vibrant theaters in Minnesota?

39:26.769 --> 39:29.465
Suffice it to say,

39:29.598 --> 39:33.728
the first time I sawthat
118-year-old curtain go up,

39:33.803 --> 39:35.998
a curtain went up
in my heart.

39:36.072 --> 39:38.336
- Thank you so much.
- Amy, thanks.

39:38.407 --> 39:40.341
- Great to meet you.
- Thanks.

39:46.215 --> 39:49.378
- Hey. What's goin' on?
- Hey.

39:49.452 --> 39:53.047
I got a call from Natalie's counselor.
Seems our gifted child...

39:53.122 --> 39:55.613
has been hiding her light
under a bushel.

39:55.691 --> 39:59.286
She was asked by the theater club
to write a play, and she declined.

39:59.362 --> 40:01.455
What?
Wait, wait.

40:01.530 --> 40:04.624
- Natalie, what's this about?
- It's so nothing.

40:04.700 --> 40:07.464
It's so something.
And you're gonna do it.

40:07.536 --> 40:09.731
- Says who?
- Says me.

40:09.805 --> 40:12.899
How was I?

40:12.975 --> 40:15.603
[Rick] When you said the curtain
went up in your heart, it was so sexy.

40:15.678 --> 40:18.442
- What a line!
- Was I okay?

40:18.514 --> 40:22.541
Hey, Rick, do you mind not doin' that
in front of me? Huh?

40:22.618 --> 40:25.917
Callie, could we talk outside?

40:25.988 --> 40:29.116
[Callie]
So what is it?

40:29.191 --> 40:32.683
Could you please keep Natalie
a little while longer?

40:32.762 --> 40:35.697
- Sure.
- Thanks.

40:35.765 --> 40:38.063
Hey, have you been
working out?

40:38.134 --> 40:43.231
Um, I played squash
with some of the executives at work.

40:43.305 --> 40:45.933
Squash at work!

40:46.008 --> 40:47.600
- You?
- Yeah, me.

40:47.676 --> 40:49.735
Huh.

40:49.812 --> 40:52.110
Bye.

40:56.986 --> 40:58.954
Hmm.

41:02.224 --> 41:05.193
I'm ready.
I'm very excited.

41:05.261 --> 41:07.126
I've given it a lot of thought,

41:07.196 --> 41:09.164
and I know exactly what I want
to do to that guy.

41:09.231 --> 41:11.358
New gi?

41:11.434 --> 41:13.197
- Yeah.
- Cool.

41:13.269 --> 41:17.638
- Okay. I wanna psyche the guy out.
- Okay.

41:17.706 --> 41:20.869
- This is like half mental, right?
- Yeah.

41:20.943 --> 41:23.969
So we go with Clint Eastwood.
That stare of his.

41:25.381 --> 41:27.110
Okay?

41:27.183 --> 41:31.517
- "You talkin' to me?" I won't say that.
- I gotcha, I'm followin' ya.

41:31.587 --> 41:35.648
Okay, okay.
Then I cut loose. A lot of moves.

41:35.724 --> 41:40.184
You teach me that Crouching
Dragon, Hidden Tiger stuff.

41:40.262 --> 41:43.629
I'm sure the run across the buildings
is a bit advanced, but we can get to it.

41:43.699 --> 41:46.293
Then go to the Matrix stuff.
A lot of movement.

41:46.368 --> 41:49.394
This stuff's
gotta be unsettling.

41:49.472 --> 41:51.804
Then you go into a pose.
Hah!

41:51.874 --> 41:53.967
What do you think?

41:54.043 --> 41:56.409
- Well, not good.
- Why not?

41:58.447 --> 42:01.041
That's why. Okay?

42:01.117 --> 42:04.985
- Okay.
- All right. Let's go.

42:05.054 --> 42:07.181
Look!
There's one of my balls.

42:07.256 --> 42:10.191
Feelin'better?

42:10.259 --> 42:12.489
Yeah!

42:12.561 --> 42:14.222
We only got two weeks.

42:14.296 --> 42:17.424
So we're not gonna
train you to be a warrior,

42:17.500 --> 42:21.129
'cause, well--
let's face it.

42:21.203 --> 42:24.001
- Come on. Let's keep it simple.
- [Groans]

42:24.073 --> 42:26.507
- Got it? You all right?
- Uh-huh.

42:26.575 --> 42:31.137
Now, I want you to show me
what this guy did to you.

42:31.213 --> 42:35.547
Okay. Um, let's say you're me.
That's where I work. I drove in there.

42:35.618 --> 42:39.054
Said, "Hey, you can't park there."
He said, "Yes, I can."

42:39.121 --> 42:43.057
Silent movies, okay, Joe?

42:43.125 --> 42:45.059
Let's get right
to the action.

42:45.127 --> 42:49.564
Come on. Show me exactly
what he did. Here.

42:49.632 --> 42:52.795
Stand there.
I'm you. Okay?

42:52.868 --> 42:56.497
- You want me to hit you?
- I want you to try, Beavis.

42:56.572 --> 42:59.200
You're going to kick me
in the nuts again.

43:00.209 --> 43:02.769
That's it.
There you go.

43:02.845 --> 43:05.643
- He just-- Was a quick slap.
- Okay.

43:05.714 --> 43:08.979
I could've done that, but it was fast.
I could hardly see it comin'.

43:09.952 --> 43:13.149
- Okay.
- Look over there.

43:13.222 --> 43:15.247
Wow!
I like that!

43:15.324 --> 43:17.292
So it's just hands.
Just show me the--

43:17.359 --> 43:20.487
Okay, okay,
easy, windmill.

43:20.563 --> 43:23.361
Okay.

43:23.432 --> 43:25.662
Okay. All right.
Try to hit me in the face.

43:25.734 --> 43:27.793
- Ready?
- Yeah.

43:27.870 --> 43:30.338
- Okay, okay.
- Good.

43:30.406 --> 43:34.467
Crosses and jabs.
Mix it up a little bit. Crosses, jabs.

43:34.543 --> 43:37.910
Now, really try to hit me.
Come on.

43:42.918 --> 43:46.251
- Ow! That hurt.
- Cover your face!
Always keep your hand up.

43:47.389 --> 43:49.653
- That hurt!
- I know it hurt. Let's go!

43:55.764 --> 43:59.632
- Okay, let's do it again.
- Does anybody ever come back here?

44:09.311 --> 44:13.907
##Don't be shive
by the tone of my voice ##

44:13.983 --> 44:18.977
##Just got my new weapon
The weapon of choice ##

44:19.054 --> 44:21.147
##Don't be shive--##

44:21.223 --> 44:23.157
I could wear that.

44:26.262 --> 44:29.720
That is a ten-year
associate's suit.

44:31.300 --> 44:33.359
But you're not
a ten-year associate.

44:33.435 --> 44:37.838
You shouldn't be wearing
a suit like this. No, I'm not kidding.

44:37.906 --> 44:42.138
I'd just appreciate it
if you'd wear another suit.

How long were you
standing there anyway?

01:00:51.715 --> 01:00:54.980
I got there right before
you did that little victory dance.

- Oh, oh, no, no.

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:03.621
like throwing
myself down these steps.

01:01:03.694 --> 01:01:07.687
Okay. I'll be flat out amazed...

01:01:07.764 --> 01:01:11.723

for at least a week.

What the hell is that?
That position doesn't even exist.

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.814

Uh, read your manual.
Meg, if Joe Scheffer stays home...

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:35.756
and pours bourbon on his cereal,
he can sue us for negligence,

01:06:35.825 --> 01:06:38.089
but if he comes back to work,
we make him happy.

01:06:38.161 --> 01:06:41.460
A reasonable period of time
passes, we're free and clear.

01:06:41.531 --> 01:06:45.126
He can't sue.
That is presidential compliance.

01:06:45.202 --> 01:06:47.466
And what happens after
that reasonable period?

01:06:47.537 --> 01:06:50.472
- What happens to his job, to him?
- I don't know! Who cares?

- Stop for a second, Meg.

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:14.017
- You remember why your little

- I am here to help--

To keep corporate objectives.
That's the only reason you're here.

01:08:16.859 --> 01:08:19.953
You're here to make
people believe we care.

- Yeah. You're a propagandist.

You tell anyone about our conversation,

01:08:28.470 --> 01:08:31.167
and you can start
sending out your resume.

01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:33.970
- We were never under review, were we?
- Oh, yeah!

01:08:34.044 --> 01:08:36.376
We're under review, Meg.
We're all under review all the time.

01:08:36.446 --> 01:08:39.813
And that includes, uh,
your boyfriend, Scheffer.

01:08:39.883 --> 01:08:43.979
-What the hell is that supposed to mean?
-You'll see.

01:08:47.057 --> 01:08:49.719

haven't you, Joe?

Just look at this.
This is great.

- Great, so here's the deal.

so your big day is almost here.

01:09:09.245 --> 01:09:12.772
- A small problem, though.
- What's the small problem?

01:09:12.849 --> 01:09:16.444
The company is posting
security guards in the parking lot
for the foreseeable future...

01:09:16.519 --> 01:09:19.044
so that fight is not
gonna happen here, Joe.

01:09:19.122 --> 01:09:23.286
- But it has to.
- I know. This is your
15 minutes of fame.

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:25.520
What do you mean,
15 minutes?

01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:27.859

Ah, here.

01:09:45.314 --> 01:09:47.249
Thank you.

01:09:48.752 --> 01:09:52.448
What if somebody could
change the venue?

01:09:52.522 --> 01:09:56.049
What if the fight actually
happened in a schoolyard?

01:09:56.126 --> 01:09:59.395
- How cool would that be?
- Could you do that?

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:03.226
No, I couldn't, uh, officially...

01:10:03.299 --> 01:10:05.233
do anything.

01:10:07.170 --> 01:10:11.470
Well, why would you,
not officially, do this?

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:14.669
Because I know how you feel, Joe.

01:10:14.744 --> 01:10:16.974
I was nobody too.

Guys like McKinney used me
to limber up for real fights.

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:24.584
If I had a shot at a guy
like that now, I would--

- Thanks, Joe.

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:43.201
You're Randy Moss today,
buddy!

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:47.231
Wow. Is it hot in here,
or is it that outfit, Linda?

01:10:47.310 --> 01:10:52.111
- How about some fresh grapefruit?
- Thank you, Joe.

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:54.115
Meg, you never saw
my new office.

01:10:54.183 --> 01:10:56.117
Oh, yeah, you know,
I've been really busy.

01:10:56.185 --> 01:10:57.948
- You want some fruit?
- Uh--

01:10:58.021 --> 01:11:00.012
Joe, squash tomorrow?

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:02.284
Yeah, but let's find some players
that can actually play.

01:11:02.358 --> 01:11:05.486
- I hear that.
- I've gotta get going.

I don't know who that was.

01:11:30.253 --> 01:11:33.848
I'm glad to see you so happy,
Joe. Really.

01:11:33.923 --> 01:11:35.254
Are you mad at me?

01:11:35.324 --> 01:11:39.385
This is my problem.
I'm gonna work it out.

01:11:39.462 --> 01:11:41.225
Wait a minute.
Meg, come on.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:43.891
When I had a problem,
you helped me work it out.

01:11:43.966 --> 01:11:45.991
- Did I?
- Yeah.

01:11:46.069 --> 01:11:49.129
Now that there's a problem
with you, I wanna be here for you.

01:11:52.408 --> 01:11:56.242
- I wanted to be a guidance counselor.
- Okay.

01:11:56.312 --> 01:12:00.248
I wanted to help girls
like me.

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:04.343
Girls who were too busy
cleaning the house or paying bills...

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:07.321
to do homework
or join the pep squad.

01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:11.190
But I thought I should
make a little money first, right?

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.421

Before I knew it, I was
waking up in a better apartment.

- And you can adjust the--
- I gotta go.

01:12:36.753 --> 01:12:39.153
Seriously, Meg.
If you need to talk again,

01:12:39.222 --> 01:12:41.816
you know where I live.

01:12:41.891 --> 01:12:43.825
Thanks, Joe.

For what? I don't think
I helped you very much.

I helped you that much either.

What I really want to do...

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:48.005
is put on a teddy and an overcoat
and chew some gum.

01:15:49.078 --> 01:15:51.012
It didn't really come to me
like that.

01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:55.813

and I got cold, so I, uh--

- Natalie, just give me the key.
- Not a chance.

in the mood for this, okay?

breakdown. She was smoking.

I was gettin'uncomfortable.

sexual tension between us.

breakdown and quit.

01:18:38.948 --> 01:18:41.382
Nervous breakdown?

01:18:41.450 --> 01:18:44.112
Do we need to review
who the psycho is here?

01:18:44.186 --> 01:18:46.677
Oh. I need more bleach.
I need more bleach.

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:50.088
- Gotta have more bleach.
- That's what Jeremy said.

01:18:50.159 --> 01:18:54.255
He also said that...
you slept with him.

01:18:54.330 --> 01:18:57.163
Oh! Does that bother you?

01:18:59.602 --> 01:19:02.969
Yeah.

01:19:03.038 --> 01:19:05.438
Never happened.
If Jeremy chained me to a bed,

01:19:05.508 --> 01:19:08.102
I'd set myself on fire.

at Pembroke High School.

01:19:20.823 --> 01:19:23.223
I know. It's kind of
a huge cut in pay.

01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:27.228
I think I may have to give them
money, actually, but--

01:19:27.296 --> 01:19:30.891
This is wonderful.
You're great with kids.

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:33.366
And you'll have an opportunity
to show them that victory dance.

they can fire you.

Jeremy moved the fight.
We're not fighting in the parking lot.

01:19:50.052 --> 01:19:52.043
He wants to see you
get your ass kicked.

01:19:52.121 --> 01:19:54.521
- Nobody's gonna get their ass kicked.
- Let it go.

01:19:54.590 --> 01:19:57.582
And no one is gonna get fired.
Everybody loves me over there.

01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:00.823
Uh-huh. Then where
were they before?

01:20:03.599 --> 01:20:06.124
If I back out,
I will never know who I am.

01:20:06.202 --> 01:20:10.263
You are the guy that admitted to me
that your ex-wife put a hole in you...

01:20:10.339 --> 01:20:13.831
so big that it still burns
when the wind blows through.

01:20:13.909 --> 01:20:15.911
The guy who kept helping me
even after he had stapled his sleeve...

01:20:15.911 --> 01:20:18.971
The guy who kept helping me
even after he had stapled his sleeve...

to a "Choose Happiness" banner.

01:20:21.049 --> 01:20:23.017
You mean the guy that got his ass
kicked in the parking lot?

01:20:23.085 --> 01:20:26.714
No, no. I mean the guy that
kept getting up every morning,

01:20:26.788 --> 01:20:30.349
being a father to his daughter--
that's the guy that you are.

01:20:30.425 --> 01:20:34.486
I was nobody. You have no idea
what I'd be giving up if I don't fight.

01:20:34.563 --> 01:20:37.555
I know what you would be
giving up if you do.

01:20:41.403 --> 01:20:44.998
I'm sorry, Meg.
I have to fight.

01:20:46.808 --> 01:20:50.266
Yeah? Because
you're afraid not to.

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:08.258
Okay, okay, okay!
You... are winded!

01:21:08.330 --> 01:21:12.130

-Water?

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.634

01:21:20.475 --> 01:21:22.409
How come you got out
of doing movies?

01:21:23.679 --> 01:21:25.772
I guess I kind of turned into
an unbearable shit.

01:21:25.847 --> 01:21:28.509
Aren't there a lot of people
like that in this business?

01:21:28.583 --> 01:21:32.576
Yeah. But it helps if you've got
something that nobody can live without.

01:21:42.597 --> 01:21:46.499
You know something funny?
When my first picture became a hit,

01:21:46.568 --> 01:21:51.471
there were a whole lot of people
just lined up waiting to kiss my ass.

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:56.239
Then when the movies
started to tank, well--

01:21:56.311 --> 01:21:59.542
you know, they lined up
behind somebody else's ass.

01:22:01.416 --> 01:22:03.350
Well--

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:09.320
You gotta have people in your life
who are there for you.

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:13.527
Whether you're somebody or not.

01:22:15.230 --> 01:22:17.164
Did you find somebody like that?

taken McKinney?
