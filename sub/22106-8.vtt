01:04.529 --> 01:05.696
Hey!

01:05.697 --> 01:06.665
Geez.

01:06.666 --> 01:08.966
You want to look before you
come at someone?

01:08.967 --> 01:10.334
Shouldn't you be
with your squad?

01:10.335 --> 01:12.303
Rowyn will have your hide
if you ditched your post.

01:12.304 --> 01:13.337
I came to get you.

01:13.338 --> 01:14.638
What's wrong?

01:14.639 --> 01:15.373
Skin Riders.

01:15.373 --> 01:16.007
What?

01:16.007 --> 01:16.508
How many?

01:16.509 --> 01:18.042
Relax.

01:18.043 --> 01:18.477
All right?

01:18.477 --> 01:18.910
There was two.

01:18.911 --> 01:20.077
They're dead.

01:20.078 --> 01:21.645
I got one, Thomas got the
other back at Green Valley.

01:21.646 --> 01:22.980
And you left your squad?

01:22.981 --> 01:25.116
There's somethin' else.

01:25.117 --> 01:26.117
The Skin Riders weren't alone.

01:26.118 --> 01:28.519
They were following reborns.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.720
Sparks are making people again,

01:29.721 --> 01:31.255
people we know.

01:31.256 --> 01:34.191
Who?

01:34.192 --> 01:36.560
Who is it, Nico?

01:36.561 --> 01:41.466
It's your parents, Kylie.

02:27.379 --> 02:29.647
My companion has been
calling to Silas all morning,

02:29.648 --> 02:32.082
and getting no response.

02:32.083 --> 02:37.154
Are you sure you programmed
that drone right?

02:37.155 --> 02:38.455
Maybe you didn't program
the drone right

02:38.456 --> 02:40.991
and that was your
plan all along.

02:40.992 --> 02:44.995
To kill Silas like
you tried to kill me.

02:44.996 --> 02:48.532
I tied you to a tree, Duncan.

02:48.533 --> 02:49.467
If I meant to kill you

02:49.468 --> 02:52.536
I would've used a more
enjoyable method.

02:52.537 --> 02:58.976
Like programming
a drone to kill me?

02:58.977 --> 03:01.278
My knowledge comes
from the Ancestor.

03:01.279 --> 03:09.279
Have you lost your faith?

03:14.693 --> 03:15.627
Well?

03:15.628 --> 03:16.894
Escape will be difficult.

03:16.895 --> 03:19.230
The entire camp is watching us.

03:19.231 --> 03:22.499
If Jax finds out you did the
opposite of what he intended,

03:22.500 --> 03:23.500
he'll kill us both.

03:23.501 --> 03:25.603
I freed you
of the parasite, Silas.

03:25.604 --> 03:28.906
If that costs me my
life, then so be it.

03:28.907 --> 03:31.308
Why are you being kind to me?

03:31.309 --> 03:33.177
If you knew what I've
done as a Skin Rider,

03:33.178 --> 03:34.945
you wouldn't be
so eager to help.

03:34.946 --> 03:40.050
No one is so far gone that they
are undeserving of kindness.

03:40.051 --> 03:40.785
If you can cure me,

03:40.786 --> 03:42.386
why not cure the others?

03:42.387 --> 03:43.988
You are not cured.

03:43.989 --> 03:47.191
I've merely severed the
parasite's control over you,

03:47.192 --> 03:49.627
but it will try and retake you.

03:49.628 --> 03:51.862
Rapid growth, organ seizure,

03:51.863 --> 03:53.497
you will not survive.

03:53.498 --> 03:56.467
So I'll die here?

03:56.468 --> 03:58.402
AAlone?

03:58.403 --> 04:03.874
Escape is difficult,
not impossible.

04:03.875 --> 04:11.875
If you've got a
plan, let's hear it.

04:13.652 --> 04:16.320
Manipulating Silas' neural
pathways has caused swelling

04:16.321 --> 04:17.688
in his frontal lobe,

04:17.689 --> 04:20.925
he must be kept in an induced
sleep while he recovers.

04:20.926 --> 04:23.527
Should've thought
this through, Jax.

04:23.528 --> 04:27.531
Killing our priest won't exactly
endear you to the Ancestor.

04:27.532 --> 04:29.700
Or to our people.

04:29.701 --> 04:30.268
When Silas wakes,

04:30.269 --> 04:32.703
tell him I went north.

04:32.704 --> 04:33.672
Two of our brothers were killed,

04:33.673 --> 04:35.339
we'll find who's responsible.

04:35.340 --> 04:41.679
I will relay your message.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.047
You trust that thing?

04:43.048 --> 04:44.581
Stay here.

04:44.582 --> 04:45.550
Post two guards
outside the tent.

04:45.551 --> 04:48.085
No one leaves.

04:48.086 --> 04:51.822
Especially not the drone.

04:51.823 --> 04:52.824
Let's go.

05:30.829 --> 05:36.567
Show me their necks.

05:36.568 --> 05:37.634
They already checked.

05:37.635 --> 05:39.269
We're not Skin Riders.

05:39.270 --> 05:41.305
We're looking for survivors
from a settlement.

05:41.306 --> 05:42.973
Don't talk.

05:42.974 --> 05:43.974
Don't move.

05:48.046 --> 05:49.046
They're clean.

05:53.418 --> 05:54.285
That's a warm reception.

05:54.286 --> 05:56.653
You brought Riders
into my territory.

05:56.654 --> 05:58.422
Don't expect a red carpet.

05:58.423 --> 05:59.290
Bury the bodies.

05:59.290 --> 06:00.258
Hide the Graves.

06:00.259 --> 06:03.560
Thomas!

06:03.561 --> 06:05.763
Take Raven and signal
to the other scouts.

06:05.764 --> 06:10.734
Everyone back to Pine Lake,
all tracks covered.

06:10.735 --> 06:12.202
You used that
little girl to draw us

06:12.203 --> 06:14.471
and the Skin Riders here so
you could ambush them.

06:14.472 --> 06:15.806
Raven did what had to be done.

06:15.807 --> 06:16.907
She's a child!

06:16.908 --> 06:18.842
Who was smart enough
to end a threat to her people.

06:18.843 --> 06:20.210
A threat that you
brought, by the way.

06:20.211 --> 06:22.012
We didn't know they
were tailing us,

06:22.013 --> 06:22.981
or that you were here.

06:22.982 --> 06:24.515
So you're ignorant and foolish.

06:24.516 --> 06:26.550
And grateful.

06:26.551 --> 06:27.785
Why did you scan us?

06:27.786 --> 06:29.119
To check for the parasite?

06:29.120 --> 06:30.088
Diseases.

06:30.089 --> 06:31.955
Glad to know we have
a clean bill of health.

06:31.956 --> 06:33.524
I'm Ezra, this is Ly...

06:33.525 --> 06:34.492
Lynn.

06:34.493 --> 06:36.093
Yeah, I know who you are.

06:36.094 --> 06:37.528
You're from the
original Settlement?

06:37.529 --> 06:39.563
I can't say if it was the
original Settlement or not.

06:39.564 --> 06:40.731
But yeah.

06:40.732 --> 06:41.765
That's how I know you.

06:41.766 --> 06:43.567
Name's Rowyn.

06:43.568 --> 06:45.402
We're looking for
our daughter, Kylie.

06:45.403 --> 06:46.537
Is she here?

06:46.538 --> 06:49.773
You answer my questions
and then maybe I answer yours.

06:49.774 --> 06:51.542
How many people are
at the Settlement?

06:51.543 --> 06:52.477
There are four of us.

06:52.478 --> 06:53.577
Two stayed behind.

06:53.578 --> 06:54.245
Names?

06:54.246 --> 06:55.679
A man and a woman.

06:55.680 --> 06:56.914
Abram and Feena.

06:56.915 --> 06:58.115
Feena I like.

06:58.116 --> 07:00.918
Abram I'll kill on sight.

07:00.919 --> 07:03.287
Well... Why would you kill Abram?

07:03.288 --> 07:04.055
Unresolved issue.

07:04.055 --> 07:04.789
Stay out of the mud!

07:04.789 --> 07:05.323
Sorry.

07:05.324 --> 07:10.794
You'll leave tracks.

07:10.795 --> 07:12.062
It's a miracle you two have
survived this long

07:12.063 --> 07:14.698
considering how
careless you are.

07:14.699 --> 07:17.768
Is Kylie here?

07:17.769 --> 07:20.704
What's your last
memory of Kylie?

07:20.705 --> 07:22.072
Her death.

07:22.073 --> 07:23.140
During the invasion.

07:23.141 --> 07:25.375
So you have no memory
of her in the Settlement?

07:25.376 --> 07:26.844
No recollection
of her growing up?

07:26.845 --> 07:29.012
Nothing of the last
12 years of her life?

07:29.013 --> 07:31.048
So she is alive?

07:31.049 --> 07:32.916
She's alive.

07:32.917 --> 07:35.252
But she's not your
little girl anymore.

07:35.253 --> 07:37.121
Technically, she was
never your girl at all.

07:37.122 --> 07:38.355
You're just copies.

07:38.356 --> 07:39.923
Keep that in mind.

07:39.924 --> 07:41.191
Are you taking us to her?

07:41.192 --> 07:43.594
I'm not taking you
anywhere, you're following.

07:43.595 --> 07:44.695
But know this:

07:44.696 --> 07:46.463
If you come with me,
you can never leave.

07:46.464 --> 07:47.598
Why not?

07:47.599 --> 07:49.566
Because if the Riders get you
they'll know your mind.

07:49.567 --> 07:51.435
And in your mind will be the
location of Pine Lake,

07:51.436 --> 07:53.437
and then everyone I know
and love will be dead

07:53.438 --> 07:54.838
because you led them to us.

07:54.839 --> 07:57.307
So, come or go, I don't care.

07:57.308 --> 08:02.146
But if you're coming,
you're staying.

08:02.147 --> 08:03.380
Kylie, wait!

08:03.381 --> 08:04.282
My parents returned
from the dead

08:04.283 --> 08:05.415
and you're going
to tell me to wait?

08:05.416 --> 08:07.784
We all returned from the dead.

08:07.785 --> 08:09.453
Can we talk about this?

08:09.454 --> 08:11.021
You can't go running
back into their arms.

08:11.022 --> 08:11.856
They're my parents.

08:11.857 --> 08:13.123
They looked like your parents.

08:13.124 --> 08:14.324
Maybe they're not.

08:14.325 --> 08:15.193
Maybe it's your parents bodies

08:15.194 --> 08:16.360
with other people's
brain states,

08:16.361 --> 08:17.628
we don't know yet.

08:17.629 --> 08:19.763
Abram said that the Sparks and
the drones would never do that.

08:19.764 --> 08:21.733
Well, Abram was wrong
about a lot of things.

08:25.403 --> 08:26.703
And if they are your parents,

08:26.704 --> 08:27.704
maybe you want to think

08:27.705 --> 08:30.073
about what you're going
to say to them about us?

08:30.074 --> 08:31.475
They're going to tell you
you're too young to get married.

08:31.476 --> 08:31.976
You don't know that.

08:31.976 --> 08:32.544
Yes I do,

08:32.544 --> 08:33.077
that's what parents do,

08:33.078 --> 08:34.344
they object.

08:34.345 --> 08:37.214
Well it's none of
their business.

08:37.215 --> 08:38.082
All right.

08:38.082 --> 08:39.582
Well, good luck
convincing them of that.

08:39.583 --> 08:40.784
My parents liked you.

08:40.784 --> 08:42.385
Yeah, as a nice kid
around the Settlement,

08:42.386 --> 08:44.521
not as a soninlaw.

08:44.522 --> 08:46.690
Besides, they looked at me
like they didn't even know me.

08:46.691 --> 08:47.958
How could they not know you?

08:47.959 --> 08:50.327
What if they were reborn with
their original brain states?

08:50.328 --> 08:52.829
We recorded brain states
at the Settlement all the time.

08:52.830 --> 08:54.231
Yeah I know, but what if?

08:54.232 --> 08:55.232
Hey, they looked younger, Kylie,

08:55.233 --> 08:57.834
ten years at least.

08:57.835 --> 08:59.670
You need to accept the
possibility that these people

08:59.671 --> 09:07.671
aren't the parents you remember.

09:12.217 --> 09:15.519
There are no Skin Riders
within a onemile radius.

09:15.520 --> 09:16.753
You sure?

09:16.754 --> 09:18.689
My scans are thorough.

09:18.690 --> 09:19.823
Keep a look out.

09:19.824 --> 09:23.361
If you see anything,
come get us.

09:32.870 --> 09:35.105
If this buried drone is smashed
to pieces like Yellow says,

09:35.106 --> 09:36.907
it's not salvageable.

09:36.908 --> 09:39.343
We don't need the parts,
just the data.

09:39.344 --> 09:42.279
Anything that can tell us
more about the Settlement.

09:42.280 --> 09:45.115
It's been in the ground
awhile, Abram.

09:45.116 --> 09:48.252
Water damage, dirt,
decomposition.

09:48.253 --> 09:50.387
We won't recover any data.

09:50.388 --> 09:52.090
We won't know if we don't try.

10:10.675 --> 10:11.742
If the drone's buried here,

10:11.743 --> 10:13.910
then why does it look like
the grave of an adult?

10:13.911 --> 10:16.713
Maybe the settlers didn't
want to draw attention to it.

10:16.714 --> 10:18.682
Maybe, we shouldn't
be digging it up.

10:18.683 --> 10:21.785
Aren't you curious to know
what's stored on the drone?

10:21.786 --> 10:23.320
Maybe it knows
where the Ancestor is,

10:23.321 --> 10:25.956
or how Duncan became infected.

10:25.957 --> 10:27.758
Or nothing at all.

10:27.759 --> 10:29.726
They buried it, Feena.

10:29.727 --> 10:33.964
And they showed it the same
respect they showed each other.

10:33.965 --> 10:36.600
If they thought
it that valuable,

10:36.601 --> 10:38.403
maybe we will too.

10:56.387 --> 10:57.521
There may be more Riders.

10:57.522 --> 10:58.588
Move everyone deeper
into the caves

10:58.589 --> 11:02.125
and try not to frighten
the children.

11:02.126 --> 11:04.461
I thought you said you
lived at Pine Lake?

11:04.462 --> 11:05.529
Where's the lake?

11:05.530 --> 11:06.630
There isn't one.

11:06.631 --> 11:07.764
That's the point.

11:07.765 --> 11:09.633
If the Riders catch
wind of Pine Lake,

11:09.634 --> 11:12.637
this is the last
place they'll look.

11:34.025 --> 11:37.094
They look at you and see ghosts.

11:37.095 --> 11:39.029
Both of us are dead?

11:39.030 --> 11:42.199
We were told that I
came off with Kylie.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.534
You did.

11:44.535 --> 11:46.470
What happened to me?

11:46.471 --> 11:50.073
Before coming here,
we lived in trees to the west.

11:50.074 --> 11:53.744
Hidden well, or so we thought.

11:53.745 --> 11:55.912
Riders attacked in the night.

11:55.913 --> 11:58.782
Only 19 of us escaped.

11:58.783 --> 12:04.821
We all would have
died if not for you.

12:04.822 --> 12:06.123
How did I die?

12:06.124 --> 12:07.424
Silas killed you.

12:07.425 --> 12:08.393
Silas?

12:08.394 --> 12:11.228
Yes, your brother.

12:11.229 --> 12:14.064
We'd all still be in the
Settlement if not for him.

12:14.065 --> 12:16.099
And Kylie wouldn't be an orphan.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.568
She's not an orphan anymore.

12:18.569 --> 12:22.305
We'll see.

12:22.306 --> 12:25.909
If you're one of us,
you fight with us.

12:25.910 --> 12:27.544
I'm not much of a fighter.

12:27.545 --> 12:29.414
Then you're not the Lynn I knew.

12:38.756 --> 12:40.524
There.

12:40.525 --> 12:43.927
You realize this makes
us grave robbers?

12:43.928 --> 12:46.763
Looks worse than I thought.

12:46.764 --> 12:49.599
Yellow?

12:49.600 --> 12:51.401
The core is badly damaged,

12:51.402 --> 12:53.703
but some of the data
may be salvageable.

12:53.704 --> 12:54.971
Any brain states?

12:54.972 --> 12:57.607
I won't know until I'm
hardwired to the core.

12:57.608 --> 12:59.844
Feena, I will require
your assistance.

13:27.472 --> 13:29.539
That's the best I can do.

13:29.540 --> 13:30.540
Sloppy work but...

13:30.541 --> 13:32.008
Sufficient. Thank you.

13:32.009 --> 13:35.412
Can you access anything?

13:35.413 --> 13:38.315
I have downloaded 78
percent of Blue's database.

13:38.316 --> 13:41.084
The remaining 22
percent is corrupted.

13:41.085 --> 13:42.252
What'd you learn?

13:42.253 --> 13:44.788
The Settlers recorded
their brain states often.

13:44.789 --> 13:46.623
I have their memories.

13:46.624 --> 13:48.859
Then you can tell us what
happened to the settlers.

13:48.860 --> 13:50.093
Better if I show you.

13:50.094 --> 13:52.262
Show us?

13:52.263 --> 13:53.730
You mean, deep recall?

13:53.731 --> 13:56.233
You will not like it, Abram.

13:56.234 --> 13:58.435
Because I suffered
when they died?

13:58.436 --> 14:06.142
Because it's your
fault they died.

14:06.143 --> 14:08.211
You'll sleep here.

14:08.212 --> 14:09.379
It's not as comfortable
as the Settlement,

14:09.380 --> 14:13.783
but it'll do.

14:13.784 --> 14:15.485
Will the Skin Riders
find us here?

14:15.486 --> 14:16.786
Let's hope not.

14:16.787 --> 14:18.955
There aren't many of us left.

14:18.956 --> 14:19.990
If we couldn't stop them before,

14:19.991 --> 14:24.361
I doubt we could stop them now.

14:24.362 --> 14:26.730
We've endangered them.

14:26.731 --> 14:27.598
There's plenty of distance

14:27.599 --> 14:29.132
between where they
found us and here.

14:29.133 --> 14:30.500
Not enough.

14:30.501 --> 14:31.635
Rowyn's smart.

14:31.636 --> 14:34.771
Her soldiers are
disciplined, they...

14:34.772 --> 14:36.573
Their soldiers are
practically children.

14:36.574 --> 14:38.175
Children who can take
care of themselves.

14:41.913 --> 14:45.249
Kylie?

14:48.452 --> 14:50.921
Kylie?

14:50.922 --> 14:52.856
You have to ask if it's me?

14:52.857 --> 14:55.458
You were six years old
when we saw you last.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.327
So you don't know me?

14:57.328 --> 14:59.195
We want to.

14:59.196 --> 15:01.264
If you let us.

15:01.265 --> 15:03.700
My mother cut her hair short
when we came north.

15:03.701 --> 15:05.368
You're younger than she was,
too.

15:05.369 --> 15:07.003
Not much older than I am.

15:07.004 --> 15:09.873
II know that I look different,

15:09.874 --> 15:12.075
but I'm the same person.

15:12.076 --> 15:13.343
And so is your father.

15:13.344 --> 15:14.644
And those aren't your clothes.

15:14.645 --> 15:16.546
They belong to Isabelle
and Anish, I know.

15:16.547 --> 15:18.281
I helped make them.

15:18.282 --> 15:20.283
We found them in the Settlement.

15:20.284 --> 15:22.052
Did you find the virus too?

15:22.053 --> 15:23.053
Why aren't you sick?

15:23.054 --> 15:24.921
The Sparks made a cure.

15:24.922 --> 15:26.656
When your mother was reborn,

15:26.657 --> 15:29.926
the Sparks found a way
to vaccinate against it.

15:29.927 --> 15:32.329
I was engineered
with an immunity.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.798
That's what they do.

15:34.799 --> 15:36.366
They engineer.

15:36.367 --> 15:38.535
They shape us into whatever
they want us to be.

15:38.536 --> 15:39.736
They make a duplicate,

15:39.737 --> 15:41.938
only it isn't a duplicate
because it's been tinkered with,

15:41.939 --> 15:43.974
it's been changed.

15:43.975 --> 15:46.776
It only looks like the original.

15:46.777 --> 15:48.678
Look, I...

15:48.679 --> 15:51.615
I came here to see
if you were my parents.

15:51.616 --> 15:53.917
I want you to be.

15:53.918 --> 15:59.356
I'm just not sure
if you are yet.

15:59.357 --> 16:02.193
I hope you can understand that.

16:04.929 --> 16:06.463
Let her go.

16:06.464 --> 16:08.231
What just happened?

16:08.232 --> 16:10.800
We need to look at this
from her perspective.

16:10.801 --> 16:11.669
I am!

16:11.670 --> 16:14.270
ShShe's alone
and we're her parents.

16:14.271 --> 16:15.672
Are we?

16:15.673 --> 16:17.340
The previous versions of us,

16:17.341 --> 16:20.176
they were more her parents
than we were.

16:20.177 --> 16:23.213
We raised her until she was six.

16:23.214 --> 16:25.615
She probably doesn't
remember that.

16:25.616 --> 16:29.586
Look, our memories of her are
not her memories of us.

16:29.587 --> 16:31.354
What do we do then?

16:31.355 --> 16:33.290
We prove to her who we are.

17:29.513 --> 17:30.114
How is he?

17:30.115 --> 17:31.882
Sleeping.

17:36.053 --> 17:37.921
Solar panels?

17:37.922 --> 17:42.560
Heh, need a bit of a recharge?

17:44.528 --> 17:47.530
You know, I like having
a drone around.

17:47.531 --> 17:50.533
Reminds me of the good old days.

17:50.534 --> 17:52.569
Come on now.

17:52.570 --> 17:54.637
You have my memories.

17:54.638 --> 17:56.740
You know I helped
with the project.

17:56.741 --> 17:58.475
You were familiar
with the drones.

17:58.476 --> 17:59.542
You were no expert.

17:59.543 --> 18:01.678
I knew enough to be dangerous.

18:01.679 --> 18:03.713
I turned Yellow off easy enough.

18:03.714 --> 18:05.181
I manipulated you.

18:05.182 --> 18:06.983
Something you will not repeat,

18:06.984 --> 18:08.051
I assure you.

18:08.052 --> 18:10.153
Really?

18:10.154 --> 18:12.756
TOUCH THAT DRONE and
it will be your last act!

18:12.757 --> 18:13.591
What happened to you?

18:13.591 --> 18:14.558
Ambush.

18:14.559 --> 18:16.159
The reborns have found
the other settlers.

18:16.160 --> 18:18.561
Why didn't you call?

18:18.562 --> 18:20.263
My Companion is injured.

18:20.264 --> 18:21.264
Let me see th...

18:22.166 --> 18:24.067
Take the squad of men
to Crow's Creek!

18:24.068 --> 18:25.402
My men will meet you there!

18:29.840 --> 18:30.840
Are you deaf?!

18:43.454 --> 18:44.789
They're gone.

18:48.726 --> 18:50.326
That was smart.

18:50.327 --> 18:52.462
They'll discover it was
a trick soon enough.

18:52.463 --> 18:53.463
This way.

19:14.485 --> 19:16.119
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

19:16.120 --> 19:17.387
Nicholas.

19:17.388 --> 19:19.255
We all have to learn.

19:19.256 --> 19:23.193
Protecting the community
is everyone's responsibility.

19:23.194 --> 19:25.628
I wish that wasn't the case.

19:25.629 --> 19:28.498
I mean, I wish you
didn't feel threatened.

19:28.499 --> 19:30.968
Yeah, well, that's life.

19:32.970 --> 19:34.470
You look the same.

19:34.471 --> 19:40.510
Older of course,
but same features.

19:40.511 --> 19:43.379
This is really strange for you,
I know.

19:43.380 --> 19:45.114
It's strange for me
and your mom, too.

19:45.115 --> 19:47.917
She's not my mom.

19:47.918 --> 19:50.954
My mom died protecting
this community.

19:50.955 --> 19:52.255
Protecting me.

19:52.256 --> 19:53.523
You're right.

19:53.524 --> 19:57.527
She's not the same person
who raised you.

19:57.528 --> 20:00.230
She wasn't there for you
in the Settlement.

20:00.231 --> 20:02.765
But she is the same human being.

20:02.766 --> 20:05.468
Just as you're the same
Kylie that we remember.

20:05.469 --> 20:08.638
I'm not the same Kylie
you remember.

20:08.639 --> 20:11.241
I'm not six years old anymore!

20:11.242 --> 20:12.842
I don't need the parents
of my childhood.

20:12.843 --> 20:16.746
I need the parents
of who I am now!

20:16.747 --> 20:18.081
And they're already gone.

20:18.082 --> 20:20.316
It's me, Kylie.

20:20.317 --> 20:21.517
I'm the same man.

20:21.518 --> 20:25.355
Same man who left us?

20:25.356 --> 20:30.126
Same man who never came back?

20:30.127 --> 20:34.063
Do you have any idea
what that did to my mother?

20:34.064 --> 20:36.066
What that did to me?

20:38.435 --> 20:41.204
Look, you're someone
from a different time,

20:41.205 --> 20:43.673
and so am I.

20:43.674 --> 20:46.043
Maybe we should
just accept that.

21:32.556 --> 21:34.123
Spread out.

21:34.124 --> 21:35.159
Look for tracks.

21:46.503 --> 21:50.206
Why is it my fault
the settlers died?

21:50.207 --> 21:51.274
I will show you.

21:51.275 --> 21:52.275
Be very still.

22:14.732 --> 22:15.932
What is this?

22:15.933 --> 22:17.967
This is the previous settlement.

22:17.968 --> 22:19.302
No forcefield.

22:19.303 --> 22:21.070
There was no need for one...

22:21.071 --> 22:22.438
Not yet.

22:22.439 --> 22:23.473
Whose memory is this?

22:23.474 --> 22:26.310
They should've been back by now.

22:28.445 --> 22:30.213
Ezra!

22:30.214 --> 22:31.748
They can't hear or see us.

22:31.749 --> 22:32.916
Hey!

22:33.917 --> 22:35.518
They're coming.

22:35.519 --> 22:37.221
That's me.

22:41.625 --> 22:44.160
Find anything?

22:44.161 --> 22:45.728
Is that Silas's?

22:45.729 --> 22:47.398
I made it for him.

22:48.032 --> 22:48.999
Hey, hey.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.034
You should not be climbing up
that ladder.

22:51.035 --> 22:53.270
I tell her that all the time,
but she doesn't listen.

22:53.904 --> 22:55.138
Where did you get this?

22:55.139 --> 22:56.372
On Silas.

22:56.373 --> 22:58.941
Now don't misunderstand,
he's alive.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.076
He attacked us.

23:00.077 --> 23:02.245
Attacked you?

23:02.246 --> 23:03.446
Something's wrong.

23:03.447 --> 23:06.749
There was a growth on his neck.

23:06.750 --> 23:08.651
It glowed.

23:08.652 --> 23:10.553
He spoke to us,
but it was like...

23:10.554 --> 23:12.955
Someone else was speaking.

23:12.956 --> 23:14.157
Where was this?

23:14.158 --> 23:15.925
Near the old Karik warship
to the south.

23:15.926 --> 23:17.727
There's no way you're
going out there this late

23:17.728 --> 23:19.128
with the temperature dropping.

23:19.129 --> 23:20.997
I'm not leaving my brother
out there alone.

23:20.998 --> 23:23.067
Trust me, you should.

23:30.641 --> 23:32.508
Silas was the first Skin Rider.

23:32.509 --> 23:34.944
He went hunting
and did not return.

23:34.945 --> 23:36.179
How was he infected?

23:36.180 --> 23:38.347
The parasite creates a
multicellular structure

23:38.348 --> 23:41.717
much like a fungal fruiting
body that disperses spores

23:41.718 --> 23:43.486
on contact.

23:43.487 --> 23:45.021
Silas breathed in a spore?

23:45.022 --> 23:46.589
Or ate an animal that had.

23:46.590 --> 23:49.625
But where did this parasite
come from?

23:49.626 --> 23:52.395
Why haven't humans ever dealt
with it before?

23:52.396 --> 23:54.464
The parasite came
with the Karik.

23:54.465 --> 23:56.599
It's been on earth
since the invasion.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.733
It came in their ships?

23:57.734 --> 23:59.235
It came in them.

23:59.236 --> 24:01.437
The Karik are a largely
peaceful species.

24:01.438 --> 24:04.173
The ones who attacked earth
were controlled by parasites.

24:04.174 --> 24:05.641
They were Skin Riders?

24:05.642 --> 24:07.911
Same parasite, different host.

24:27.197 --> 24:29.433
I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

24:32.569 --> 24:34.403
What?

24:34.404 --> 24:37.074
Didn't occur to you I'd use
my own men as bait?

24:47.784 --> 24:49.452
Just because they are younger
than your parents

24:49.453 --> 24:51.787
doesn't mean they
aren't your parents.

24:51.788 --> 24:54.757
Everything that is my relationsh
with my parents,

24:54.758 --> 24:56.660
isn't them.

24:57.394 --> 25:00.263
Memories, moments.

25:00.264 --> 25:01.264
They're just strangers.

25:01.265 --> 25:03.332
Strangers who desparately
want to know you.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.867
You hate the Sparks
and the drones!

25:04.868 --> 25:06.537
Why are you supporting this?

25:10.240 --> 25:16.312
Because I would give anything to
have one hour with my parents,

25:16.313 --> 25:21.284
or my husband, or my son.

25:21.285 --> 25:23.486
Even if they didn't know me.

25:23.487 --> 25:24.820
Even if...

25:24.821 --> 25:28.057
I could only watch them
from far off,

25:28.058 --> 25:29.760
I would take that hour.

25:31.028 --> 25:33.696
I'm not saying this is easy,
Kylie.

25:33.697 --> 25:36.199
I'm saying you've been
given something.

25:36.200 --> 25:38.601
And I think you should at
least find out what it is

25:38.602 --> 25:40.504
before you give it up.

25:59.189 --> 26:00.556
Your blood pressure is dropping.

26:00.557 --> 26:02.124
Breathing's slowing.

26:02.125 --> 26:05.094
The parasite is pressing
on your organs and nerves.

26:05.095 --> 26:07.197
Can't you do something?

26:22.813 --> 26:24.447
Is this a dream?

26:24.448 --> 26:26.682
A controlled state
of consciousness,

26:26.683 --> 26:28.151
not unlike hypnosis.

26:31.288 --> 26:32.989
My parents' cabin.

26:32.990 --> 26:36.460
Where you felt most at peace,
before the invasion.

26:39.997 --> 26:42.164
You've blocked the pain?

26:42.165 --> 26:45.636
Sadly, I can only do so while
I keep you in this state.

26:49.906 --> 26:52.075
Parasite's gone, Silas.

26:53.844 --> 26:55.345
This is a safe place.

26:56.179 --> 26:57.381
Grape soda?

27:01.618 --> 27:04.086
We used to drink these all
the time when we were kids.

27:04.087 --> 27:06.389
Mom kept them in the fridge
in the basement.

27:06.390 --> 27:08.725
Where do you think I got these?

27:20.771 --> 27:23.072
You're not the real Ezra,
are you?

27:23.073 --> 27:24.974
We're playing pretend here.

27:24.975 --> 27:27.343
I'm Ezra's brain state.

27:27.344 --> 27:29.712
The drone is helping
because this isn't a memory,

27:29.713 --> 27:33.583
but I'm 92 percent Ezra.

27:35.085 --> 27:37.853
I'm dying.

27:37.854 --> 27:40.723
There isn't anything
to do about it.

27:40.724 --> 27:45.161
Your body's dying,
but you aren't.

27:45.162 --> 27:47.930
Because the drone will
preserve my brain state?

27:47.931 --> 27:50.066
Because I don't think we die.

27:50.067 --> 27:52.402
Not us, not who we are.

27:54.638 --> 27:56.318
You're getting a little
metaphysical on me.

27:57.841 --> 28:00.409
It's not metaphysics, Silas.

28:00.410 --> 28:02.745
It's hope.

28:02.746 --> 28:04.914
I like to think that the
universe isn't so cruel

28:04.915 --> 28:06.615
that we exist,

28:06.616 --> 28:08.618
and then we're forgotten.

28:09.953 --> 28:12.222
It's best that I'm forgotten.

28:12.923 --> 28:15.024
What I've done as a Skin Rider...

28:15.025 --> 28:16.026
Wasn't you.

28:18.328 --> 28:19.963
Some of it was.

28:22.866 --> 28:23.866
Someone's coming.

28:29.039 --> 28:30.639
Hurry!

28:30.640 --> 28:31.640
This way.

28:58.635 --> 29:00.469
Duncan's moving toward
the Settlement.

29:00.470 --> 29:02.938
To block our way.

29:02.939 --> 29:05.574
He knows we fooled him.

29:05.575 --> 29:07.009
Why not shoot him with a dart?

29:07.010 --> 29:09.212
Jax removed all of my defenses.

29:09.813 --> 29:10.880
Of course he did.

29:10.881 --> 29:13.482
He also removed my ability
to project brain states,

29:13.483 --> 29:16.685
but he reinstalled that once
he thought me under his control.

29:16.686 --> 29:18.354
I don't think that trick
will work twice.

29:18.355 --> 29:21.591
I will get you inside
the Settlement, Silas.

29:22.459 --> 29:23.659
Because you pity me?

29:23.660 --> 29:26.530
Because it's not too late
for you to set everything right.

29:28.265 --> 29:29.265
Stay close.

29:48.452 --> 29:50.887
You're a brave boy.

29:55.225 --> 29:57.761
Thomas, isn't it?

30:00.263 --> 30:01.765
Do you remember me, Thomas?

30:04.668 --> 30:10.272
I'm willing to bet that if we
asked you where your people are,

30:10.273 --> 30:12.508
you wouldn't tell us.

30:12.509 --> 30:15.578
Even if we tortured you.

30:15.579 --> 30:17.646
Am I right?

30:17.647 --> 30:21.016
But you see,

30:21.017 --> 30:23.419
we won't have to torture you.

30:23.420 --> 30:26.655
By midday tomorrow,
you'll tell us everything,

30:26.656 --> 30:28.325
without me even asking.

30:40.504 --> 30:41.770
Rowyn!

30:41.771 --> 30:43.272
Thomas hasn't checked in yet.

30:43.273 --> 30:46.109
And several of the lookouts
spotted a campfire to the south.

30:46.877 --> 30:48.578
What do we do?

30:50.313 --> 30:51.814
You're asking for our advice?

30:51.815 --> 30:53.249
We had a council
in the Settlement.

30:53.250 --> 30:55.218
We made these
decisions together.

30:55.852 --> 30:57.486
Any chance Thomas
made that fire?

30:57.487 --> 30:58.221
No way.

30:58.222 --> 30:59.321
He wouldn't miss checkin either.

30:59.322 --> 31:00.723
Especially when
we're on lockdown.

31:00.724 --> 31:02.491
Maybe the campfire's
from your people.

31:02.492 --> 31:04.760
Feena and Abram were safe
where they are,

31:04.761 --> 31:06.795
and they wouldn't risk
a fire anyway.

31:06.796 --> 31:09.098
We should assume the worst
as a precaution.

31:09.099 --> 31:10.366
That it's Skin Riders?

31:10.367 --> 31:13.703
That Thomas has been taken,
and infected.

31:15.038 --> 31:16.438
How much time would
that give us?

31:16.439 --> 31:17.640
Before the parasite takes him?

31:17.641 --> 31:18.741
A day, maybe less.

31:18.742 --> 31:21.043
If you don't think you can
defend these caves,

31:21.044 --> 31:22.211
you have two options.

31:22.212 --> 31:23.546
Either leave,

31:23.547 --> 31:25.414
or stay and hope that
I'm wrong about Thomas.

31:25.415 --> 31:27.416
If we leave,
we expose ourselves.

31:27.417 --> 31:29.485
You lose your
defensive position, yes.

31:29.486 --> 31:30.420
There's no cover outside.

31:30.421 --> 31:32.154
We can't move quickly
with the children.

31:32.155 --> 31:34.390
Which is why you want
to leave immediately.

31:34.391 --> 31:36.725
Give yourselves as much
lead time as possible.

31:36.726 --> 31:37.594
In the dark?

31:37.595 --> 31:38.827
You said it yourself...

31:38.828 --> 31:40.763
There's not much cover
in daylight.

31:40.764 --> 31:43.832
You know this terrain better
than they do.

31:43.833 --> 31:44.734
I assume you've scouted?

31:44.734 --> 31:45.669
Of course we have,

31:45.670 --> 31:47.236
but you're asking us
to abandon our home,

31:47.237 --> 31:49.238
the safest place we know.

31:49.239 --> 31:51.307
And when it might not
even be necessary.

31:51.308 --> 31:53.375
If Thomas reveals this location,

31:53.376 --> 31:55.511
this isn't a safe place anymore.

31:55.512 --> 31:56.712
Yeah, no thanks to you.

31:56.713 --> 31:57.280
Nico!

31:57.281 --> 31:58.380
We can defend the caves!

31:58.381 --> 32:01.484
I'm not sure we can.

32:05.956 --> 32:07.489
Forgive Nicholas.

32:07.490 --> 32:10.326
He and Thomas were close.

32:10.327 --> 32:12.328
I'd say he and Kylie
are close, too.

32:12.329 --> 32:13.829
They're engaged.

32:13.830 --> 32:15.431
I'm probably not supposed
to tell you that,

32:15.432 --> 32:17.833
but you are her parents.

32:17.834 --> 32:19.636
Or so you tell me.

32:26.242 --> 32:27.843
You still haven't told us
why I'm responsible

32:27.844 --> 32:29.445
for what happened
to the settlers.

32:29.446 --> 32:30.946
It wasn't only you.

32:30.947 --> 32:33.717
The Obelisk bears
some responsibility.

32:34.718 --> 32:36.318
You want to make a virus?

32:36.319 --> 32:39.622
Our immune systems can't
handle the Skin Rider parasite.

32:39.623 --> 32:42.791
Every person who is
infected is lost.

32:42.792 --> 32:46.395
But if we make a genetic change
in the nucleus of our cells,

32:46.396 --> 32:48.330
we could starve the
Skin Rider parasite.

32:48.331 --> 32:49.765
Make us resistant to infection.

32:49.766 --> 32:51.767
How many of our people
are we going to lose

32:51.768 --> 32:52.669
before we do something?

32:52.670 --> 32:54.570
You're talking
about changing DNA.

32:54.571 --> 32:56.105
I'm not saying there isn't risk.

32:56.106 --> 32:57.673
Well, nobody's touching my DNA.

32:57.674 --> 32:58.774
Or mine.

32:58.775 --> 33:01.110
This isn't my idea.

33:01.111 --> 33:03.012
It came from the Obelisk.

33:03.013 --> 33:04.313
But you think it's worth doing?

33:04.314 --> 33:06.048
I trust the Obelisk,

33:06.049 --> 33:07.349
and I trust the Sparks.

33:07.350 --> 33:10.252
They'd make the virus.

33:10.253 --> 33:13.088
I say virus and you think "bad,"

33:13.089 --> 33:15.290
but we have millions
of them in us already,

33:15.291 --> 33:16.726
and some of them are good!

33:19.329 --> 33:20.896
Lynn?

33:20.897 --> 33:25.634
You're the medical professional.

33:25.635 --> 33:28.137
We've all lost someone
to the parasite.

33:28.138 --> 33:31.840
A friend, a spouse, a parent.

33:31.841 --> 33:33.509
We're all afraid.

33:33.510 --> 33:36.478
But what you're describing,
Abram...

33:36.479 --> 33:38.847
sounds like gene therapy.

33:38.848 --> 33:41.216
Transferred genes
could be overexpressed,

33:41.217 --> 33:42.985
altered DNA could
cause mutations,

33:42.986 --> 33:44.086
a lot could go wrong.

33:44.087 --> 33:45.287
The Sparks know
what they're doing.

33:45.288 --> 33:47.990
The Sparks have made mistakes.

33:47.991 --> 33:49.625
We can't impose this on anyone.

33:49.626 --> 33:51.226
People have to choose
to do this,

33:51.227 --> 33:53.128
and understand the risks.

33:53.129 --> 33:55.197
It has to be all of us.

33:55.198 --> 33:56.532
Otherwise those who
take the virus

33:56.533 --> 33:58.834
might infect those who don't.

33:58.835 --> 34:00.302
Then we separate.

34:00.303 --> 34:02.504
Those who want to take the
virus and those who don't.

34:02.505 --> 34:04.006
Leave the Settlement?

34:04.007 --> 34:05.808
Until we know if the virus
works or not.

34:05.809 --> 34:07.776
Those who take
the virus should leave.

34:07.777 --> 34:09.344
I'm not going anywhere.

34:09.344 --> 34:11.480
The virus would likely weaken
them temporarily,

34:11.481 --> 34:12.981
even if it works.

34:12.982 --> 34:14.384
They'd need rest;
They should stay.

34:16.753 --> 34:18.254
This is stupid.

34:26.529 --> 34:28.996
It is my fault.

34:28.998 --> 34:32.469
I killed them all.

42:02.785 --> 42:04.953
I wish there was more
we could do.

42:04.954 --> 42:06.421
You're leaving your home
because of us.

42:06.422 --> 42:08.557
We're leaving our home
because of them.

42:08.558 --> 42:10.458
It was time for us
to move on anyway.

42:10.459 --> 42:11.360
We'll find you,

42:11.361 --> 42:13.128
and we'll bring Thomas with us.

42:13.129 --> 42:14.863
I hope so.

42:14.864 --> 42:16.097
Where's Kylie?

42:16.098 --> 42:17.566
She's inside.

42:17.567 --> 42:22.171
And refusing to leave.

42:22.638 --> 42:23.172
She can't stay.

42:23.173 --> 42:24.839
I can't make her go.

42:24.840 --> 42:32.840
If you can convince her,
she can catch up.

42:34.884 --> 42:42.884
If you can convince her,
she can catch up.

42:47.630 --> 42:47.897
Hey.

42:47.897 --> 42:48.564
Hey!

42:48.564 --> 42:49.465
Are you out of your mind?

42:49.466 --> 42:50.732
You need another bow.

42:50.733 --> 42:52.067
And I'm a better shot
than you are.

42:52.068 --> 42:52.935
And no.

42:52.936 --> 42:53.936
Rowyn needs you
protecting the others.

42:53.937 --> 42:55.403
If the Skin Riders
don't get by us,

42:55.404 --> 42:57.505
then the other people won't
need protection.

42:57.506 --> 42:58.007
No.

42:58.008 --> 42:59.107
I won't allow it.

42:59.108 --> 43:00.575
So you command me now?

43:00.576 --> 43:01.377
Of course not!

43:01.378 --> 43:02.544
I'm trying to protect you,
Kylie.

43:02.545 --> 43:06.248
What do you think I'm doing?

43:06.249 --> 43:07.749
If I had would have known you
were going to act this way,

43:07.750 --> 43:09.017
I wouldn't have stayed.

43:09.018 --> 43:11.086
Well, if you had consulted with
me before you made a decision,

43:11.087 --> 43:13.088
then maybe you would have known.

43:13.089 --> 43:16.591
That's how marriage works.

43:16.592 --> 43:19.294
We're not married yet.

43:19.295 --> 43:23.098
Or ready to act like it
apparently.

43:23.099 --> 43:25.100
I'm not giving up on my parents.

43:25.101 --> 43:26.468
So they're your parents now?

43:26.469 --> 43:29.337
They risked their lives
to find me.

43:29.338 --> 43:31.273
They don't know me,
but they love me.

43:31.274 --> 43:32.507
How can you tell?

43:32.508 --> 43:34.009
The way they look at me.

43:34.010 --> 43:36.811
It's the way they've always
looked at me.

43:36.812 --> 43:44.812
I don't want to risk
losing that again.

43:53.062 --> 43:54.195
I'm here to help you!

43:54.196 --> 43:55.498
Like you helped Lynn?

43:56.432 --> 43:57.333
That's not me now.

43:57.334 --> 43:59.334
You expect us to believe that?

43:59.335 --> 44:00.568
Ask the drone.

44:00.569 --> 44:02.804
You need Silas, Abram.

44:02.805 --> 44:04.139
Why?

44:04.140 --> 44:09.945
We can't destroy
the Ancestor without him.

44:13.716 --> 44:14.749
What's wrong with him?

44:14.750 --> 44:17.819
The parasite is killing him.

44:17.820 --> 44:18.754
What do we do?

44:18.755 --> 44:26.755
Bring him inside.

44:28.798 --> 44:36.798
Bring him inside.

44:38.841 --> 44:46.448
Bring him inside.

44:46.449 --> 44:50.485
It's a good lookout spot.

44:50.486 --> 44:53.421
Yup.

44:53.422 --> 44:56.191
Have you seen anything?

44:56.192 --> 45:03.398
I would've told everybody
if I had.

45:03.399 --> 45:05.367
Have you been an archer
a long time?

45:05.368 --> 45:12.340
We learned how to hunt
at an early age.

45:12.341 --> 45:16.044
How long have you and Kylie
been interested in each other?

45:16.045 --> 45:18.580
A while.

45:18.581 --> 45:20.949
That's a vague answer, Nico.

45:20.950 --> 45:22.317
A month?

45:22.318 --> 45:24.686
A year?

45:24.687 --> 45:25.854
These are the easy questions.

45:25.855 --> 45:27.655
Is that why you came
all the way out here?

45:27.656 --> 45:28.257
Was to...

45:28.258 --> 45:30.825
To interview me?

45:30.826 --> 45:34.462
To get to know you.

45:34.463 --> 45:39.534
So far I'd say
it's going poorly.

45:39.535 --> 45:42.537
Yeah, I'm sorry.

45:42.538 --> 45:44.806
I don't mean to come off
as defensive.

45:44.807 --> 45:48.176
I can understand why you
might be.

45:48.177 --> 45:50.979
Your girlfriend's parents show
up when you least expect it.

45:50.980 --> 45:53.548
She's my fiancÃ©e.

45:53.549 --> 46:01.189
She's not my girlfriend.

46:01.190 --> 46:04.259
What about your parents?

46:04.260 --> 46:06.394
My mother...

46:06.395 --> 46:09.130
was never reborn.

46:09.131 --> 46:13.802
And my father, he -

46:13.803 --> 46:19.240
He's a Skin Rider.

46:19.241 --> 46:22.177
I'm sorry.

46:22.178 --> 46:24.512
I take care of myself.

46:24.513 --> 46:29.317
And Kylie does, too.

46:29.318 --> 46:31.586
What was our relationship?

46:31.587 --> 46:33.054
You and I?

46:33.055 --> 46:35.991
Before the other me died?

46:37.159 --> 46:38.159
It was this.

46:38.160 --> 46:38.727
It was you,

46:38.728 --> 46:40.161
wary of Kylie and me.

46:40.162 --> 46:41.830
You didn't much like the idea.

46:41.831 --> 46:43.097
Why not?

46:43.098 --> 46:47.635
Because you thought that she was
too young to be with anybody.

46:47.636 --> 46:52.006
You disagree?

46:52.007 --> 46:54.175
Well, this is a different
world, Lynn.

46:54.176 --> 46:57.045
This isn't suburbia anymore.

46:57.046 --> 47:00.381
We either build the human race
or we die out.

47:00.382 --> 47:01.850
I love Kylie.

47:01.851 --> 47:06.521
And I would die before I let
anything happen to her.

47:06.522 --> 47:09.691
I may not be what you
had hoped for for her.

47:09.692 --> 47:12.694
But I am something.

47:12.695 --> 47:14.462
Nico!

47:14.463 --> 47:22.463
It's Thomas.

47:23.405 --> 47:24.939
Thomas!

47:24.940 --> 47:27.243
Where were you?

47:29.044 --> 47:32.147
Nico!

48:12.254 --> 48:13.254
It's all right.

48:13.689 --> 48:17.392
It's going to be all right.

48:17.393 --> 48:19.494
There's something in the tip
of the arrow.

48:19.495 --> 48:21.931
The parasite?

48:32.575 --> 48:35.877
That's four of my brothers
you've killed.

48:35.878 --> 48:43.878
This ends now!

48:45.321 --> 48:46.454
How is he?

48:46.455 --> 48:50.124
Red is keping him
in an induced coma.

48:50.125 --> 48:51.426
Why?

48:51.427 --> 48:53.127
To make him comfortable.

48:53.128 --> 48:56.831
The parasite continues to grow
and strangle his brain stem.

48:56.832 --> 49:00.234
If Silas regains consciousness,

49:00.235 --> 49:08.235
he will die.
