24:51.192 --> 24:52.442
[Goofy] Gosh!

24:52.733 --> 24:54.942
We might be in for a real storm.

24:55.025 --> 24:56.733
You think it could be trouble?

24:56.817 --> 24:58.483
I know it is.

24:58.608 --> 25:01.567
We need to blow away these stormy clouds.

25:01.692 --> 25:04.192
And that means we need a Mouseketool.

25:04.317 --> 25:05.692
Everybody say,

25:05.900 --> 25:08.483
[sing-song] "Oh, Toodles!"

It's me to the rescue!

25:19.650 --> 25:23.192
[Goofy] Gosh. All that's left
is the Mystery Mouseketool.

25:24.025 --> 25:25.525
[Mickey] Everybody say...

25:25.650 --> 25:28.775
[all] Mystery Mouseketool!

25:29.233 --> 25:32.067
[Mickey]
What's today's Mystery Mouseketool?

25:33.108 --> 25:35.233
Whoa! Pete's windmill!

25:35.358 --> 25:36.900
[Goofy] Pete's windmill?

25:37.025 --> 25:39.900
But that's what blew all the animals away!

25:40.025 --> 25:43.192
[Mickey] Yeah, but now we can use it
to blow all the clouds away.

25:44.067 --> 25:46.192
We picked all our Mouseketools.

25:55.817 --> 25:57.525
Goofy, Donald.

25:57.608 --> 26:00.233
Pull the lever that makes the windmill go.

26:00.358 --> 26:01.983
Hmm. Let's see now.

26:02.567 --> 26:04.233
Red means "stop."

26:04.317 --> 26:06.108
So it's not the red lever.

26:06.233 --> 26:08.775
But what color means "go"?

26:10.733 --> 26:12.442
[Donald] I know, I know!

26:12.567 --> 26:14.483
Green means "go!"

26:14.733 --> 26:18.150
That's right, Donald.
Let's try the green lever!
