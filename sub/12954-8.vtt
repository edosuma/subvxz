01:52.735 --> 01:56.297
- Did you crack Dean's encryption?
- Well, I was working on it, but...

01:56.298 --> 01:57.732
I got a little sidetracked.

01:57.733 --> 02:00.110
I intercepted a strong of MI-6 transmissions.

02:00.111 --> 02:03.420
They're all about the testing and sale of a prototype M.P.B.

02:03.421 --> 02:05.484
- That's impossible.
- Yeah, I thought so, too.

02:05.485 --> 02:06.547
What's an M.P.B.?

02:06.607 --> 02:10.994
Sorry, it's a Micro-Pulse Bomb. These things... super nasty.

02:11.044 --> 02:14.172
Incinerate the people, leave everything else intact.

02:14.173 --> 02:16.984
There was an incident aboard a train in Siberia two days ago.

02:16.985 --> 02:18.732
Information's leaking out slowly, but...

02:18.733 --> 02:20.358
You think that's the test?

02:20.795 --> 02:22.715
There's no way the Brits are pursuing an M.P.B.

02:22.716 --> 02:24.483
That breaks every arms treaty own to man.

02:24.484 --> 02:26.551
Well, have you notified the Director General?

02:26.552 --> 02:28.169
Until we know who we can trust,

02:28.170 --> 02:30.295
we can't approach MI-6 officially.

02:31.049 --> 02:33.693
Jack and Sydney are in England trying to find out more.

02:33.694 --> 02:37.045
In the meantime, we're going to go over every single transmission

02:37.046 --> 02:40.858
Marshall pulled off the server to see if we missed something.

02:41.233 --> 02:42.798
- I'm working on these.
- Okay.

02:42.799 --> 02:43.799
I'll take these.

02:57.609 --> 03:00.484
You should see my youngest grandchild Daisy...

03:00.986 --> 03:04.648
Four years old and already a master of the computer.

03:05.858 --> 03:07.295
Have you chosen a name?

03:07.674 --> 03:10.696
I myself have always been partial to "Rupert"...

03:10.697 --> 03:12.361
such a distinguished name.

03:13.423 --> 03:16.985
A shame it's fallen out of favor. Wouldn't you agree, dear?

03:17.653 --> 03:20.352
- Rupert... it's classic.
- Excuse me.

03:20.894 --> 03:23.287
Can't seem to get enough of that Devonshire clotted cream.

03:23.288 --> 03:25.838
We don't have it in the States. If you'll just pardon me?

03:25.839 --> 03:27.714
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

03:29.275 --> 03:33.425
I prefer the cinnamon, but the blackberry is also very good.

03:36.274 --> 03:38.649
Excuse me, ma'am, you forgot a napkin.

03:40.269 --> 03:42.718
Oh, thank you.

03:42.818 --> 03:44.094
You're welcome.

03:58.458 --> 03:59.583
Do you still play?

04:00.270 --> 04:01.832
No, gave it up years ago.

04:04.833 --> 04:06.955
You shouldn't have approached me here.

04:06.956 --> 04:10.519
I take it Joseph still doesn't know what you do for a living.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.850
How would it look for the French Ambassador

04:12.851 --> 04:14.332
to have a spook for a wife?

04:14.333 --> 04:17.456
Besides, this is where I get my best intelligence.

04:17.457 --> 04:20.894
I already talked with the Minister of Finance. He's a dimwit.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.395
What's this about, Jack?

04:23.521 --> 04:25.768
We believe someone operating within MI-6

04:25.769 --> 04:28.456
is attempting to acquire a Micro-Pulse Bomb.

04:29.705 --> 04:31.205
Well, that's outrageous.

04:31.208 --> 04:32.728
MI-6 would never sanction...

04:32.729 --> 04:33.630
I agree.

04:33.665 --> 04:37.268
More likely, whoever it is represents some corrupt element.

04:37.270 --> 04:39.142
Are you suggesting we have a double agent?

04:39.143 --> 04:41.931
Yes, but it goes much deeper than that.

04:42.895 --> 04:45.145
Have you ever heard of Prophet Five?

04:45.895 --> 04:46.836
Have you seen Elizabeth?

04:46.837 --> 04:47.859
No. Sorry.

04:49.082 --> 04:50.644
Excuse me!

04:52.458 --> 04:54.771
Are you Joseph Vachon, the French Ambassador?

04:54.772 --> 04:55.772
Why, yes, I am.

04:56.082 --> 04:59.080
I knew it. Hey, I've been taking French classes at night,

04:59.081 --> 05:03.019
'cause little ones are supposed to pick up so quickly, you know?

05:03.020 --> 05:07.145
I was just wondering if I could just practice a little bit on you.

05:07.581 --> 05:10.518
- I suppose so, yeah.
- Great. Okay. All right.

05:28.673 --> 05:30.923
The network behind Prophet Five is far-reaching.

05:30.924 --> 05:32.764
They appear to have infiltrated

05:32.765 --> 05:35.613
multiple intelligence agencies, not just MI-6.

05:35.614 --> 05:37.425
And you think that following this weapon

05:37.426 --> 05:39.988
will give us the key to finding out more?

05:40.738 --> 05:44.050
You want me to investigate my agency from the inside?

05:44.677 --> 05:47.612
I wouldn't be coming to you if it didn't also involve Sydney.

05:47.613 --> 05:50.075
Sydney? Is she all right?

05:50.174 --> 05:51.174
She's fine.

05:52.300 --> 05:54.525
You just met her, in fact.

05:54.924 --> 05:56.324
Oh, my goodness!

05:56.400 --> 05:57.800
It has been a long time.

05:58.362 --> 06:01.048
And unless she's wearing a very convincing disguise...

06:01.049 --> 06:02.736
I'm going to be a grandfather...

06:02.737 --> 06:04.999
A very young grandfather.

06:05.302 --> 06:06.302
Jack...

06:07.926 --> 06:08.926
She's lovely.

06:09.364 --> 06:12.676
She is. The agent I told you about, Michael Vaughn...

06:13.237 --> 06:14.341
He was her fiancÃ©.

06:14.342 --> 06:15.794
Oh. I'm sorry.

06:17.802 --> 06:21.552
What you're asking me to do, to investigate my own agency...

06:21.927 --> 06:22.927
That's treason.

06:24.739 --> 06:27.489
What's a little treason between old friends?

06:33.678 --> 06:36.802
My source got back to me. She confirmed what we suspected.

06:36.803 --> 06:39.612
The acquisition of the M.P.B. weapon is strictly off-book.

06:39.613 --> 06:41.300
MI-6 has not sanctioned it.

06:41.612 --> 06:43.426
Could she identify the double agent?

06:43.427 --> 06:46.924
No, but she was able to identify the engineer who designed the weapon...

06:46.925 --> 06:48.550
this man... Lukas Basarov.

06:49.549 --> 06:52.424
Tenured faculty, University of St. Petersburg.

06:52.425 --> 06:55.801
Holds advanced degrees in physics and thermonuclear engineering.

06:55.802 --> 06:57.798
Apparently, he has a side business.

06:57.799 --> 07:00.347
Basarov is currently en route to a conference

07:00.348 --> 07:02.175
being held in Sao Paolo, Brazil.

07:02.176 --> 07:05.237
He's scheduled to give a talk on theoretical microdynamics.

07:05.238 --> 07:07.488
Sounds awesome.

07:09.927 --> 07:14.364
Well, Brazil. Isn't that, you know, the place where they have string...

07:14.365 --> 07:16.498
what are they called? Not bikinis, but...

07:16.499 --> 07:17.882
Thongs.

07:17.883 --> 07:18.809
Yes.

07:20.051 --> 07:22.174
My source found evidence which indicates that

07:22.175 --> 07:25.676
within approximately 48 hours, Basarov will receive a transmission

07:25.677 --> 07:28.675
regarding where and when the sale is taking place.

07:28.676 --> 07:30.946
We can presume he'll be receiving this one

07:30.947 --> 07:32.740
at the conference via his laptop.

07:32.741 --> 07:34.678
Well, that's easy. We just access the laptop,

07:34.679 --> 07:36.799
upload the bugging software... piece of cake.

07:36.800 --> 07:37.861
I could definitely do it.

07:37.862 --> 07:40.425
You need to be here to decrypt the transmission.

07:40.426 --> 07:43.549
Rachel's perfectly equipped to do the work in the field.

07:43.550 --> 07:44.987
Wheels up in two hours.

07:53.113 --> 07:54.513
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.050
Here's your program. It's a Flinkman special.

07:57.051 --> 07:58.051
Thanks.

07:58.741 --> 08:00.362
You're sure you're okay with this?

08:00.363 --> 08:02.676
Yeah. I'm actually glad that I'm going...

08:02.677 --> 08:05.300
Anything to keep the investigation moving.

08:05.301 --> 08:08.426
When's the last time you did something just for fun?

08:08.480 --> 08:10.995
Hitting Gordon Dean on the head with a shovel, that was fun.

08:10.996 --> 08:12.177
Okay.

08:12.178 --> 08:15.365
Okay, it hasn't been high on my list of priorities.

08:15.742 --> 08:18.492
But you have to have a life.

08:19.614 --> 08:21.114
I know. Okay.

08:21.739 --> 08:23.551
I'll work on it, I promise...

08:24.115 --> 08:25.115
after Brazil.

08:38.554 --> 08:41.155
Hi, I'm checking in. Lydia Sand.

08:44.144 --> 08:46.632
The room you requested is available.

08:46.634 --> 08:48.320
I see you're here for the conference?

08:48.321 --> 08:48.953
Yes

08:48.954 --> 08:50.739
Let me get your information packet.

08:50.740 --> 08:53.175
I don't care what sort of geek convention you have here.

08:53.176 --> 08:55.676
I was told an upgrade wouldn't be a problem.

08:57.264 --> 08:58.264
Americans.

09:19.826 --> 09:21.826
So, Lydia, you here on business?

09:23.638 --> 09:24.638
Yes.

09:25.577 --> 09:26.827
The geek conference.

09:29.263 --> 09:30.513
You heard that, huh?

09:30.641 --> 09:31.641
I did.

10:00.304 --> 10:02.141
What are the odds, huh?

10:33.126 --> 10:34.326
I'm in place.

10:35.452 --> 10:37.575
Yes, I'm looking at him right now.

10:37.576 --> 10:40.513
I'll have the details of the trade by tomorrow.

10:40.954 --> 10:42.329
Don't worry, Benjamin.

10:43.077 --> 10:44.641
For what you're paying me,

10:44.642 --> 10:47.954
I won't let anything stand in my way.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.641
Dr. Basarov? Hi. Sorry to interrupt.

11:27.267 --> 11:31.142
I was just reading your article, and, well, I was wondering...

11:31.327 --> 11:32.952
would you mind signing it?

11:35.091 --> 11:40.328
Look. I have... what do you call them? Groupie.

11:41.640 --> 11:42.791
Thank you.

11:42.792 --> 11:44.349
You're welcome.

12:09.517 --> 12:11.015
I would like the shrimp stew,

12:11.016 --> 12:12.878
the pork and beef skewers

12:14.078 --> 12:17.765
and also the tomato salad. I'm trying to lay off the carbs.

12:22.703 --> 12:26.265
Get it here in ten minutes, and I'll triple the gratuity.

13:00.846 --> 13:01.846
Room service.

14:59.720 --> 15:00.608
Agent Grace.

15:00.609 --> 15:02.159
Hi, it's me.

15:02.160 --> 15:02.901
How'd it go?

15:02.902 --> 15:05.660
It went fine... great.

15:05.661 --> 15:07.911
Good. I'll notify Jack and Marshall.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.733
So what do I do now?

15:12.222 --> 15:13.594
Keep your P.D.A. with you.

15:13.595 --> 15:16.593
It'll alert you as soon as it intercepts Basarov's transmission.

15:16.594 --> 15:18.910
Then go ahead and send it to Marshall.

15:18.911 --> 15:21.783
Till then, it looks like you got the night off.

15:21.784 --> 15:22.784
Just relax.

15:23.535 --> 15:24.535
All right.

15:42.845 --> 15:43.845
Lydia?

15:45.036 --> 15:46.036
Right?

15:47.411 --> 15:50.036
I'm sorry about that crack I made earlier.

15:50.412 --> 15:53.308
12 hours on a plane next to a screaming toddler.

15:53.309 --> 15:54.845
You know how that can be.

15:54.846 --> 15:56.078
Of course, that's no excuse.

15:56.178 --> 15:58.372
Don't worry about it.

15:59.786 --> 16:02.161
Whatever beer you have on tap, please.

16:04.971 --> 16:06.221
My name's Bob Brown.

16:08.346 --> 16:11.008
Lydia. But you already knew that.

16:13.409 --> 16:14.409
Thank you.

16:16.473 --> 16:17.723
Conference that bad?

16:18.911 --> 16:22.498
No. It's just, you know, tough day.

16:24.345 --> 16:28.097
Sometimes at these work events, I feel like I'm in over my head.

16:28.098 --> 16:30.160
I just started in a new division.

16:30.973 --> 16:33.785
It's a lot more responsibilities, more risks.

16:36.409 --> 16:40.284
Sounds like you need to rethink your perspective a little bit.

16:40.723 --> 16:45.573
Anything in life worth doing has an element of risk.

16:46.412 --> 16:47.974
It's what makes life interesting.

16:50.784 --> 16:54.546
I can definitely say my life has been interesting lately.

16:56.285 --> 16:59.285
And I did manage to do what I came here for, so...

16:59.286 --> 17:00.723
Well, then good for you.

17:00.724 --> 17:02.911
As you say, cheers!

17:03.972 --> 17:04.972
Cheers.

17:11.223 --> 17:15.748
So, Bob, are you here on business as well?

17:15.847 --> 17:16.847
Yep.

17:18.099 --> 17:19.787
I'm in international trade.

17:20.348 --> 17:22.173
What do you trade?

17:22.846 --> 17:25.096
Whatever my clients pay me to trade.

17:25.848 --> 17:26.848
Do you like it?

17:27.347 --> 17:28.347
Hell, yeah.

17:29.413 --> 17:31.596
I work freelance, so I get to travel,

17:31.597 --> 17:33.909
meet all sorts of fascinating people,

17:34.160 --> 17:35.722
present company included.

17:37.349 --> 17:40.474
Last year, I tried something a little different...

17:42.161 --> 17:44.411
something more conventional, stable.

17:45.601 --> 17:46.851
How'd that work out?

17:47.913 --> 17:49.913
It didn't. I was terrible at it.

17:51.350 --> 17:54.337
I was so bored that I wanted to blow my brains out.

17:54.975 --> 17:58.662
So I decided to take less drastic measures and do something

17:59.163 --> 18:00.763
I know best.

18:04.724 --> 18:05.724
I just moved.

18:06.725 --> 18:09.037
Left my entire life behind, actually.

18:10.348 --> 18:12.410
Well, new starts are good, right?

18:13.475 --> 18:16.037
And the new people I work with are great.

18:17.162 --> 18:18.535
You don't sound too convinced.

18:18.536 --> 18:21.998
No, they are. That's part of the problem.

18:23.350 --> 18:25.350
They're so good at what they do.

18:26.599 --> 18:28.038
I mean, there's this one woman...

18:28.039 --> 18:30.914
she's amazing, and she's about to have a baby.

18:31.973 --> 18:34.786
I'm not sure I could manage work and a goldfish.

18:34.787 --> 18:36.662
Well, aquariums are overrated.

18:37.974 --> 18:38.974
Remember that.

18:39.787 --> 18:40.787
Okay.

18:42.039 --> 18:43.089
You want another one?

18:44.350 --> 18:46.060
I would love one.

18:48.914 --> 18:52.601
So, um... thank you for keeping me company.

18:54.538 --> 18:56.025
It was my pleasure.

19:01.036 --> 19:02.723
- Good night.
- Good night.

19:13.100 --> 19:14.104
Do you have your key?

19:14.105 --> 19:16.930
Oh, no, we can't go in my room. There are clothes all over the place.

19:16.931 --> 19:18.036
Can't we go into yours?

19:19.349 --> 19:20.411
- Uh...
- Please?

19:22.037 --> 19:23.037
Please.

19:26.226 --> 19:27.476
What the hell. Yeah.

19:45.398 --> 19:48.523
Just so you know, I don't usually do this.

19:50.145 --> 19:52.895
Well, I appreciate you making the exception.

19:53.898 --> 19:55.148
You should know that

19:55.897 --> 19:59.270
gorgeous engineers have a way of throwing themselves at me, so...

19:59.271 --> 20:01.146
I did not throw myself at you.

20:01.462 --> 20:04.399
Okay, okay. If that's what you need to believe.

20:11.584 --> 20:12.833
Want something to drink?

20:12.834 --> 20:14.834
- Yes, that'd be lovely.
- Okay.

20:53.611 --> 20:56.361
We're in the tropics, so how about some rum?

20:57.547 --> 21:00.122
Okay, so you hate rum.

21:00.736 --> 21:03.236
Sorry, I forgot how early my flight was.

21:03.397 --> 21:05.800
What are you talking about? We got a couple hours, right?

21:05.801 --> 21:09.110
Seriously, I've got to meet with my boss and I'm completely unprepared.

21:09.111 --> 21:12.548
Well, I'd hate to be the one to make you lose your job.

21:14.360 --> 21:16.547
- Bob, it's been...
- Yeah, it has.

21:37.665 --> 21:40.398
Carrie, honey, In, I'm into something really huge right now, okay?

21:40.399 --> 21:43.548
No, no, no, Marshall. It's Rachel. The transmission's coming in early.

21:43.549 --> 21:46.263
Okay. Uh, give me a sec.

21:47.587 --> 21:50.274
- Transferring now.
- I'll get right on it.

21:56.900 --> 21:58.575
Rachel, you did great.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.961
Marshall's almost done analyzing the transmission.

22:01.962 --> 22:03.185
It won't be much longer.

22:03.186 --> 22:04.832
I'm glad.

22:07.649 --> 22:11.024
You're in a good mood. Anything you're not telling me?

22:11.460 --> 22:14.647
I... nothing. Just... The trip was really relaxing.

22:15.337 --> 22:16.962
What did you do? Spill it out.

22:18.150 --> 22:20.412
I met a guy at the hotel.

22:21.336 --> 22:24.273
Some business guy, which is not at all my type.

22:25.152 --> 22:28.151
We were just talking at the bar, and, well, one thing led to...

22:28.152 --> 22:31.339
Another, obviously. Are you going to see him again?

22:32.461 --> 22:34.961
He thinks I'm Lydia, a British engineer.

22:35.651 --> 22:36.651
Oh, rats. Yeah.

22:36.900 --> 22:37.900
So no, I guess.

22:39.214 --> 22:42.026
Guess what happens in Brazil stays in Brazil.

22:43.462 --> 22:45.262
What happened in Brazil?

22:45.337 --> 22:47.212
Oh, Rachel got food poisoning.

22:48.149 --> 22:49.149
Sorry.

22:49.336 --> 22:50.836
Marshall decrypted the transmission.

22:50.837 --> 22:54.524
The double agent is due to meet Basarov in Spain in 14 hours.

22:54.525 --> 22:56.336
I'm leaving now to surveil the exchange.

22:56.337 --> 22:58.274
Are you taking anyone with you?

22:58.964 --> 23:01.439
My MI-6 contact is joining me.

23:04.339 --> 23:05.651
You'll coordinate from here?

23:05.652 --> 23:06.596
Yeah.

23:07.194 --> 23:08.150
 Good.

23:17.712 --> 23:19.149
Well, this is charming.

23:20.337 --> 23:21.649
I knew you'd like it.

23:22.524 --> 23:25.338
I could have spared you the trip, handled this alone.

23:25.339 --> 23:26.999
Someone from my agency is involved,

23:27.000 --> 23:29.275
you can't expect me to stand in the sidelines.

23:29.276 --> 23:30.401
I figured as much.

23:31.462 --> 23:33.320
Why don't we start with the cameras?

23:39.778 --> 23:41.374
This is Phoenix. How are you doing?

23:41.775 --> 23:43.025
We're almost set up.

23:44.028 --> 23:45.153
Connection's good.

23:46.278 --> 23:48.278
Okay, should be getting visuals.

23:50.028 --> 23:51.653
Got it. We're standing by.

23:55.089 --> 23:58.464
We can tag the weapon with this tracker. Once they...

24:01.528 --> 24:02.528
Joseph.

24:03.213 --> 24:04.963
Where does he think you are?

24:05.276 --> 24:06.901
Developing Nations Summit.

24:09.715 --> 24:10.715
You were saying?

24:11.651 --> 24:14.213
Once the weapon's in transport, we'll notify the C.N.A.

24:14.214 --> 24:17.014
so they can recover it without tipping the double agent.

24:17.777 --> 24:18.777
Sounds good.

24:20.528 --> 24:22.840
Looks like they're ahead of schedule.

24:35.964 --> 24:36.964
Do you see that?

24:37.403 --> 24:39.500
Yeah. Given the size, I'm assuming

24:39.501 --> 24:42.153
it's got at least a 20-mile blast radius.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.026
I thought he was showing up alone.

24:48.027 --> 24:49.027
So did I.

24:53.715 --> 24:56.252
That man... can you get a better image?

24:56.464 --> 24:57.964
Yeah. I'm on it.

25:00.840 --> 25:02.465
Oh, my God. That's Masari.

25:02.779 --> 25:03.779
Who?

25:04.215 --> 25:06.152
Dad, those are not MI-6 agents.

25:06.214 --> 25:09.462
Repeat... those are not MI-6 agents. That is Benjamin Masari.

25:09.463 --> 25:10.588
Wait, who's Masari?

25:10.589 --> 25:12.026
Sudanese head of the R.L.F.

25:12.027 --> 25:15.901
Terrorist squad responsible for bombing western targets in Africa.

25:15.902 --> 25:17.027
This is an ambush.

25:19.902 --> 25:20.902
The bomb!

25:27.153 --> 25:28.465
Dad, can you hear me?

25:32.463 --> 25:34.464
It's no good, Syd. They're jamming our signal.

25:34.465 --> 25:36.151
Oh, God, dad. Dad, do you copy?

25:36.466 --> 25:37.778
Dad, can you hear me?

25:38.652 --> 25:41.590
I want intel from anybody who's ever done business with Masari.

25:41.591 --> 25:43.757
I don't care if they crossed the street next to him,

25:43.758 --> 25:44.965
find out what they know.

25:45.151 --> 25:46.151
Anything yet?

25:46.779 --> 25:49.963
Well, I'm indexing passenger manifests to and from Malaga.

25:49.964 --> 25:52.214
- So far, nothing.
- Find something.

25:54.589 --> 25:56.029
The head of Interpol is on the line.

25:56.030 --> 25:57.116
Any trace from the signal?

25:57.117 --> 25:58.905
No. They must have disabled the tracker.

25:58.906 --> 26:00.715
I want everything we have on the R.L.F.

26:00.716 --> 26:01.716
Right away.

26:04.155 --> 26:05.329
I came as soon as I heard.

26:05.330 --> 26:06.902
I'm sorry to pull you away from Nadia.

26:06.903 --> 26:07.906
How did it happen?

26:07.907 --> 26:09.438
They were surveilling a weapons trade.

26:09.439 --> 26:12.330
An M.P.B. was supposed to be delivered to a double agent within MI-6.

26:12.331 --> 26:14.403
Masari and his men showed up instead.

26:15.089 --> 26:17.089
I've been reviewing the footage.

26:18.715 --> 26:19.869
What time was the meet set?

26:19.870 --> 26:21.242
2:30am, local time.

26:21.243 --> 26:23.868
- Masari and his men?
- Showed up at 2:17.

26:24.805 --> 26:27.366
The double agent never had a chance. They beat him to it.

26:27.367 --> 26:28.929
You think it's unrelated?

26:31.055 --> 26:32.180
Micro-Pulse Bomb...

26:33.431 --> 26:36.806
it's the kind of weapon that would be coveted by most criminal organizations.

26:36.807 --> 26:37.992
Masari must have found out.

26:37.993 --> 26:38.993
How?

26:39.680 --> 26:41.867
How did you get your intel, Sydney?

26:42.182 --> 26:43.807
Rachel intercepted a transmission.

26:43.808 --> 26:46.058
Well, maybe she wasn't the only one.

26:47.368 --> 26:49.305
Someone else was in that hotel.

26:53.495 --> 26:56.820
Say hello to an old friend... Julian Sark.

26:57.868 --> 26:59.931
Footage places him at the hotel in Sao Paolo

26:59.932 --> 27:02.995
at the same time that Rachel intercepted the message,

27:02.996 --> 27:05.620
which makes it likely that he did the same.

27:05.621 --> 27:06.992
I thought he was out of the game.

27:06.993 --> 27:07.993
Apparently not.

27:08.556 --> 27:10.087
He must have been working for Masari.

27:10.088 --> 27:11.867
He was probably paid for the information.

27:11.868 --> 27:12.868
Who is this guy?

27:13.181 --> 27:16.057
Kidnapper, extortionist, murderer, the list goes on.

27:16.058 --> 27:20.308
Formerly tied to SD-6 and the Covenant. He mostly works for himself.

27:20.558 --> 27:21.558
Freelance.

27:26.993 --> 27:28.867
I had no idea. I will do anything.

27:28.868 --> 27:31.868
I have to ask... did he use you for information?

27:31.931 --> 27:35.543
No. There's no way. We were never in my room.

27:35.932 --> 27:39.493
He never even had access to the transmission. I can find him.

27:39.494 --> 27:41.413
He's probably halfway around the world by now.

27:41.414 --> 27:44.368
No, when I was in his room, I saw a plane ticket.

27:44.369 --> 27:45.994
He's going to the Bahamas.

28:01.559 --> 28:02.559
Lydia.

28:02.745 --> 28:04.807
How nice. You remembered my name.

28:07.745 --> 28:08.932
Do you remember me?

28:11.868 --> 28:12.868
Sydney.

28:13.598 --> 28:16.057
I suppose a congratulations is in order.

28:17.382 --> 28:19.531
I'm warning you, if you're planning on arresting me,

28:19.532 --> 28:21.926
I'm not gonna make it easy on you, people could be hurt.

28:21.927 --> 28:25.251
My father and another agent have been taken captive

28:25.252 --> 28:26.529
by Benjamin Masari.

28:27.429 --> 28:29.866
We need to find his base of operations.

28:30.928 --> 28:34.178
My clients pay handsomely for their privacy.

28:35.025 --> 28:39.240
It would be unprofessional of me to give that information to you.

28:39.493 --> 28:41.865
Which is why we aren't here to arrest you.

28:41.866 --> 28:43.303
We're here to hire you.

29:05.341 --> 29:08.716
I was beginning to wonder if you'd forgotten about us.

29:08.842 --> 29:13.805
I imagine for you this cell seems somewhat inhuman.

29:15.407 --> 29:19.400
You westerners, so accustomed to your indulgences.

29:20.344 --> 29:21.344
Why are we here?

29:23.846 --> 29:27.560
You were transmitting a video feed when you were found.

29:28.532 --> 29:29.719
Where was it going?

29:36.971 --> 29:38.222
Holiday photos.

29:39.100 --> 29:40.719
Costa Del Sol in winter.

29:41.594 --> 29:44.469
As you say, we do like our little indulgences.

29:46.429 --> 29:47.594
Do not touch her!

29:48.223 --> 29:50.593
If you want to spare her, answer me.

29:51.258 --> 29:53.404
Where was the transmission going?

29:54.657 --> 29:55.657
Take me.

29:58.391 --> 30:00.092
I'm not easily frightened.

30:00.093 --> 30:01.093
You should be.

30:10.345 --> 30:11.345
The right one.

30:16.346 --> 30:17.908
If you want to spare her,

30:19.718 --> 30:20.718
answer me.

30:24.771 --> 30:27.648
Perhaps we should try this again.

30:28.782 --> 30:30.182
Who do you work for?

30:30.534 --> 30:32.172
- Wait.
- Don't tell him!

30:33.281 --> 30:36.554
Clearly, you don't work with your hands, huh?

30:49.220 --> 30:50.220
What is it?

30:51.282 --> 30:54.034
My sources tell me things got complicated in Spain.

30:54.035 --> 30:55.343
What do you know about it?

30:55.344 --> 30:57.844
Everything. You've kidnapped two agents.

30:58.034 --> 31:00.909
One's C.I.A. The other's British intelligence.

31:01.094 --> 31:03.656
There's an international search underway.

31:03.719 --> 31:05.823
I appreciate the information.

31:06.407 --> 31:09.157
You've saved me some time and a few bullets.

31:11.220 --> 31:14.095
Perhaps I could do more. I have a proposition.

31:14.785 --> 31:16.222
Always the businessman.

31:16.285 --> 31:19.656
Well, those agents you've kidnapped are quite valuable.

31:19.657 --> 31:22.222
I know some people that would pay an exorbitant amount of money

31:22.223 --> 31:23.344
to get their hands on them.

31:23.345 --> 31:25.532
Best kill them and be done with it.

31:26.783 --> 31:28.095
Do whatever it takes.

31:29.536 --> 31:31.536
Benjamin, you have many enemies.

31:32.470 --> 31:35.185
Given what I know, I imagine I could broker

31:35.186 --> 31:37.407
a pretty lucrative deal for myself.

31:37.535 --> 31:38.972
Are you threatening me?

31:39.157 --> 31:42.909
As you said, I'm simply a businessman. When opportunity knocks...

31:42.910 --> 31:46.117
I'll expect you within the next 24 hours.

31:46.535 --> 31:48.660
Where should we make the exchange?

31:48.782 --> 31:51.552
Tunisia. My compound.

31:51.970 --> 31:53.032
Can we trust him?

31:53.284 --> 31:54.784
He is telling the truth.

31:55.095 --> 31:56.468
I'll arrange for transport.

31:56.469 --> 31:59.094
Sydney, getting your father from Masari...

32:02.533 --> 32:04.283
We need to go in tactically.

32:07.285 --> 32:10.097
How am I supposed to sit here and do nothing?

32:10.470 --> 32:11.470
It's my dad.

32:11.783 --> 32:14.283
We both know he wouldn't want you to go.

32:18.097 --> 32:19.159
I can't lose him.

32:21.535 --> 32:22.535
You won't.

32:39.036 --> 32:40.511
- A gift?
- A locator.

32:40.659 --> 32:42.855
We need to know exactly where Masari's holding them.

32:42.856 --> 32:44.534
We can't risk tipping him off.

32:46.096 --> 32:48.533
You haven't done this before, have you?

32:48.970 --> 32:50.194
Look, I imagine you feel

32:50.195 --> 32:52.845
somewhat to blame for all of this, but you're not.

32:52.846 --> 32:54.095
I'm very good at what I do.

32:54.096 --> 32:56.910
When you're with them, press the winding stem on the watch.

32:56.911 --> 32:58.036
We'll do the rest.

32:58.569 --> 33:00.483
I must admit, you're quite fetching in black.

33:00.484 --> 33:01.489
I will gag you.

33:09.533 --> 33:11.720
Does this mean we can't be friends?

33:15.348 --> 33:16.371
Time to switch.

33:16.371 --> 33:18.080
Thank God.

33:27.472 --> 33:29.597
Hey. Heard the phone ring.

33:30.158 --> 33:31.158
Wasn't them.

33:34.348 --> 33:36.228
Um, you want some company?

33:37.285 --> 33:38.785
You know, while we wait?

33:41.034 --> 33:42.034
I'd like that.

34:00.064 --> 34:01.785
Masari's expecting me.

34:15.264 --> 34:18.577
I'm sure Colonel Masari will be very pleased to see you.

34:18.849 --> 34:19.920
If you expect to be paid,

34:19.922 --> 34:23.284
have this wreck fixed before I'm done with my business.

34:41.585 --> 34:42.647
How was the trip?

34:43.145 --> 34:44.764
Exhausting, as usual.

34:45.708 --> 34:49.205
Have you ever thought about moving somewhere more accessible?

34:49.206 --> 34:50.934
Remoteness is a virtue.

34:51.585 --> 34:53.710
Yes, and it's also time-consuming.

34:55.272 --> 34:59.109
So I'm afraid we're gonna have to cut this visit short.

35:05.210 --> 35:08.835
If you could take me to the prisoners, I can be on my way.

35:08.957 --> 35:09.957
Why the rush?

35:10.523 --> 35:12.710
I need to be in Tunis by nightfall.

35:14.021 --> 35:18.190
I'm afraid that, uh... won't be possible.

35:56.633 --> 35:58.383
Cover the entrance. Come on!

36:12.339 --> 36:14.088
She needs medical attention.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.717
You don't look so good yourself.

36:15.718 --> 36:16.841
- You okay?
- Yeah.

36:16.842 --> 36:20.217
An extraction team is standing by. I'll call for them.

36:20.277 --> 36:21.839
- Yeah.
- We've got them.

36:22.402 --> 36:23.402
And Masari?

36:23.779 --> 36:25.654
He and Sark are still missing.

36:46.403 --> 36:47.963
- Yeah?
- Sydney, it's me.

36:47.964 --> 36:49.653
Oh, thank God. How's my father?

36:49.654 --> 36:52.279
He's alive, but we've got another problem.

37:04.715 --> 37:05.715
Can we evacuate?

37:05.848 --> 37:08.110
No, there's not enough time. They won't get very far.

37:08.111 --> 37:10.777
Rachel, we're going to talk you through this.

37:14.225 --> 37:17.091
Okay, Rachel, there should be a front panel.

37:17.340 --> 37:18.340
Do you see that?

37:20.153 --> 37:21.841
Uh... yeah. It's screwed in.

37:21.842 --> 37:25.214
- Okay, great. Just unscrew it.
- Unscrew it? With what?

37:25.215 --> 37:27.215
Might I suggest something sharp?

37:28.781 --> 37:29.781
Hold on.

37:34.529 --> 37:36.563
So what happened?

37:36.906 --> 37:39.593
I overestimated my friendship with Masari.

37:40.342 --> 37:43.905
He assumed I was betraying him, and he took the money and he left.

37:43.906 --> 37:46.218
Oh. So then he knows you pretty well.

37:51.530 --> 37:53.465
Okay, I unscrewed the front panel. Now what?

37:53.466 --> 37:55.527
Okay. If this bomb works on microwave energy,

37:55.528 --> 37:59.031
it should have a coaxial capacitor bank. Do you see that?

37:59.032 --> 38:00.639
Uh, maybe. I don't know.

38:01.093 --> 38:03.593
It should be attached to a power source.

38:04.655 --> 38:05.717
Okay, I found it.

38:05.760 --> 38:07.451
Okay, great. You need to jam the pulse.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.454
How?

38:08.455 --> 38:10.591
Reroute the wires to a neutral bank.

38:22.285 --> 38:24.077
- Okay.
- Wait.

38:25.646 --> 38:28.086
- If that's the wrong wire...
- I thought you liked risks.

38:28.087 --> 38:29.093
I also like my body.

38:29.782 --> 38:31.491
As I recall, you do, too.

38:37.495 --> 38:38.593
It's still armed.

38:38.594 --> 38:42.216
That's okay. You just need to disable the compression generator.

38:42.217 --> 38:45.654
Look for a wire running to the microwave antenna. Okay?

38:45.968 --> 38:47.718
Don't you want to get Dixon?

38:47.969 --> 38:51.531
No offense, but you haven't had the best judgment lately.

38:51.532 --> 38:52.948
Okay, I got it.

38:53.281 --> 38:55.239
Cut that. That should work.

38:56.094 --> 38:57.781
- Should or will?
- Should.

39:02.534 --> 39:04.032
Just so we're clear...

39:05.216 --> 39:06.341
you approached me.

39:06.906 --> 39:09.604
You were the one that was stupid enough to let me into your room.

39:09.605 --> 39:12.531
And afterwards, you were the one that wanted to cuddle.

39:17.106 --> 39:18.106
It's disarmed.

39:20.044 --> 39:21.856
That was spectacular, Rachel.

39:22.732 --> 39:23.732
Thank you.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.636
About what you just heard...

39:28.637 --> 39:30.916
Don't need to know, don't want to know.

39:36.420 --> 39:39.667
I've spoken with the driver. There's a plane waiting in Tunis.

39:39.668 --> 39:42.418
You'll be in a London hospital by nightfall.

39:42.481 --> 39:43.981
Wish Sydney well for me.

39:46.230 --> 39:47.542
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

39:49.546 --> 39:50.546
Don't be.

40:01.918 --> 40:03.230
About your payment...

40:03.730 --> 40:06.730
You'd love to arrest me right now, wouldn't you?

40:07.230 --> 40:08.230
Next time.

40:08.855 --> 40:12.105
Give us the account number. We'll wire you your fee.

40:16.484 --> 40:17.484
Don't bother.

40:18.482 --> 40:19.794
This one's a freebie.

40:33.921 --> 40:37.168
You sure you don't need anything? I could stop by on my way home.

40:37.169 --> 40:41.131
- I'm fine, just exhausted.
- That's understandable.

40:41.732 --> 40:44.355
Why don't we meet for breakfast? I'll come by and pick you up.

40:44.356 --> 40:45.356
That'd be great.

40:49.480 --> 40:50.480
Dad...

40:52.859 --> 40:55.921
If anything had happened, and I couldn't have been there...

40:55.922 --> 40:59.684
Sydney, you did exactly what I would have wanted.

41:00.420 --> 41:02.795
You and the baby are all that matters.

41:05.172 --> 41:06.172
I love you, dad.

41:08.046 --> 41:09.046
Sleep well.

41:10.305 --> 41:16.506
