00:30.730 --> 00:31.698
Always.

Nobody said anything
about any disappearances.

DARKENING: <i>You crossed</i>
<i>my threshold</i>
<i>of your own free will</i>

00:59.359 --> 01:01.961
<i>and now by my will</i>
<i>you shall stay.</i>

01:16.142 --> 01:18.178
You will never
leave this place.

01:20.146 --> 01:22.415
You will be with
me for eternity.

01:22.482 --> 01:24.651
Mr... Darkening?

01:24.717 --> 01:26.553
Good to meet you.
You're a legend. Really.

01:26.619 --> 01:29.222
But this is
a 'one night only' appearance.

01:29.289 --> 01:31.057
It's not like
we're not tempted,

01:31.124 --> 01:33.026
but we've got
school on Monday...
so, uh...

01:33.092 --> 01:34.694
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

01:35.962 --> 01:38.231
You crossed my threshold.

01:38.298 --> 01:40.133
In a single step
you left choice behind.

01:41.201 --> 01:43.336
Now you are in my world.

01:43.403 --> 01:46.239
Your world?
You need to get
out more, mate.

01:46.306 --> 01:48.808
Er, sorry, you can't,
I forgot. You're a ghost.

01:49.242 --> 01:50.677
A ghost?

01:50.743 --> 01:52.779
Is that what you think I am?

01:52.846 --> 01:56.349
Child, there's no such thing
as ghosts.

01:56.416 --> 01:59.319
Oh, boy, this is worse
than <i>The Sixth Sense</i> .

01:59.385 --> 02:00.687

You will not have them.

harm me, Marchwood.

cannot hurt me again.

What on earth are you doing
in the fire place?

04:05.378 --> 04:08.915
We found Erasmus Darkening!
He seemed pretty
lively for a ghost.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.651
He's not a ghost.
I've seen him, too.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.119
Whatever is going on
in this house,

04:13.186 --> 04:15.455
it is far more dangerous
than a haunting.

04:15.521 --> 04:17.824
There's this technology
down there, it's ancient,

04:17.890 --> 04:20.660
but it didn't look like it
had any business being here
340 years ago!

04:20.726 --> 04:23.930
-Show me.
-There's a secret passageway
in the control room.

LORD MARCHWOOD:
You must leave this place.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.435
SARAH JANE: Lord Marchwood!

04:29.502 --> 04:30.970
Hey, your lordship.

04:32.138 --> 04:33.706
Thanks for earlier.

04:33.773 --> 04:35.742
He helped us
escape from Darkening.

04:35.808 --> 04:37.744
Yes, he saved me, too.

04:37.810 --> 04:40.580
Whatever you do,
don't go into the grounds.
There's something out there.

04:40.647 --> 04:42.115
LORD MARCHWOOD: There is still
time if you leave now.

04:42.181 --> 04:44.417
The creature that attacked you
needs time to reassemble.

04:44.484 --> 04:46.853
No, we can't leave.
Not without our friend.

04:46.919 --> 04:48.187
Your friend is
lost to Darkening.

04:48.388 --> 04:50.556
As is everyone who comes here.
As am I.

04:52.158 --> 04:53.493
As are my children.

04:53.559 --> 04:56.062
Your children helped us escape
out of the tunnel.

04:57.664 --> 05:00.533
-You've seen
Elizabeth and Joseph?
-So have I.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.135
They're here? In this house?

05:02.201 --> 05:03.569
They're looking for you.

05:05.371 --> 05:08.508
I have searched
for over 300 years.

05:08.574 --> 05:10.810
Darkening says you exist
at different frequencies.

05:12.211 --> 05:15.214
So that's how he separated you
from your children.

05:15.281 --> 05:17.750
He is a curse upon my house.
Upon my family.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.318
He has taken
the very land of my

05:19.385 --> 05:21.154
ancestors and
turned it against us.

05:24.223 --> 05:26.426
And I am responsible.

05:26.492 --> 05:30.963
You didn't die here, did you?
Neither did your children.
No one died here, did they?

05:32.398 --> 05:34.600
His curse is more
than death itself.

disappeared in the house.

06:09.902 --> 06:11.637
SARAH JANE: Poor, poor souls.

06:14.407 --> 06:17.744
Still say
there's no such thing
as ghosts, Miss Smith?

06:19.445 --> 06:21.814
-You said you
wanted to help us.
-I do.

06:24.617 --> 06:25.618
You're all trapped here?

06:25.685 --> 06:27.220
He trapped us.

06:27.286 --> 06:28.855
Erasmus Darkening?

06:28.921 --> 06:31.958
He's as much
a part of this house
as the bricks and mortar.

06:32.024 --> 06:34.427
He took my whole family away.

<i>Can anybody help me?</i>

06:37.396 --> 06:40.466
-What about Professor Rivers?
-She hasn't been
fully absorbed yet.

06:40.533 --> 06:41.901
Absorbed?

06:41.968 --> 06:43.636
By the house.

06:43.703 --> 06:44.771
Then that means there's still
time to get her back.

06:44.837 --> 06:47.406
Please. Help us all.

06:47.473 --> 06:51.277
Joseph and I,
we miss our father,
we want him back.

06:51.344 --> 06:52.478
He's okay, we've seen him.

06:53.446 --> 06:55.148
Release us from
this purgatory.

I am lord of this place

07:23.209 --> 07:25.344

cross its threshold,

07:25.411 --> 07:27.213
and step into my dominion.

07:28.581 --> 07:31.584
I am Erasmus Darkening,
lord of magic!

07:31.651 --> 07:34.253
You really shouldn't believe
your own press, you know.

07:34.320 --> 07:35.588
Maybe people believed in magic

07:35.655 --> 07:36.956
when you were
conning Lord Marchwood

07:37.023 --> 07:39.492
that you could
make gold from lead,

07:39.559 --> 07:40.927
but not any more.

07:41.527 --> 07:43.629
Hm.

07:43.696 --> 07:48.034
The passage of 340 years
has bequeathed humankind

07:48.100 --> 07:49.969
with a little
more wisdom, I see.

07:51.604 --> 07:53.906
Are you saying
you're not human?

07:55.474 --> 07:57.310
You're an alien?

07:57.376 --> 08:00.980
Alien? What are you
talking about?
These are ghosts, not aliens.

08:01.047 --> 08:04.016
This is an
emissary of the afterlife.

08:04.083 --> 08:06.152
Call me what you will.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.254
Know only that
this is my world,

08:08.321 --> 08:10.957
that I rule all
who cross its threshold,

08:12.725 --> 08:14.560
and that this night,

08:15.795 --> 08:17.997
I will come for you all.

(CRACKLING)

08:23.402 --> 08:24.170
(BUZZING OVERHEAD)

08:28.374 --> 08:30.810
Well, he knows how to
leave you wanting more,

08:30.877 --> 08:32.311
I'll give him that.

08:32.378 --> 08:35.982
So, if he's responsible
for the Professor vanishing,

08:36.048 --> 08:38.818
why didn't he take us when
he had the chance?

08:38.885 --> 08:42.855
Because he's playing with us,
trying to scare us.

08:42.922 --> 08:44.924
We don't scare that easily.

08:45.858 --> 08:47.960
Listen to me, Darkening!

08:48.160 --> 08:50.897
I have fought
the worst things from

08:50.963 --> 08:53.633
the darkest
corners of the universe.

08:53.699 --> 08:56.535
You don't stand
a ghost of a chance!

08:56.602 --> 08:58.504
DARKENING: <i>Ha, ha, ha, ha!</i>

09:00.973 --> 09:03.376
I'm not sure that
was entirely wise.

09:03.442 --> 09:06.479
Come on. Show me how to get
to Darkening's chamber.

09:12.451 --> 09:15.488
Well, can't say
I'm looking forward to this.

09:15.554 --> 09:18.357
Hold on. If Darkening
catches us all in his lab,

09:18.424 --> 09:20.259
-we're gonna be in
real trouble.
-She's got a point.

09:20.326 --> 09:22.128
When he found us
down there before,

09:22.194 --> 09:24.664
it wasn't exactly
what you'd call
a magical moment.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.465
You need someone
to keep him busy.

09:26.532 --> 09:29.068
No. It's out of the question.
It's far too dangerous.

09:29.135 --> 09:31.637
And all of us piling into
Darkening's lab isn't?

09:31.704 --> 09:33.306
Even a ghost
can't be in two places

09:33.372 --> 09:36.175
at one time.
Not even an alien ghost!

09:36.242 --> 09:38.177
Which means, if me and Clyde
are keeping him busy,

09:38.244 --> 09:39.812
there's no way he can stop you
taking a look at that
thing down there.

09:41.480 --> 09:43.416
The logic is undeniable.

09:43.482 --> 09:44.650
All right. But stay together.

09:44.717 --> 09:46.786
And, whatever you do,
don't go outside!

09:46.852 --> 09:48.354
Okay.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.655
You be careful.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.357
Don't worry about me.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.925
I've got Toby here.

09:54.961 --> 09:56.095
Come on.

10:05.204 --> 10:08.174
So, uh, how do you
distract a ghost?

10:08.240 --> 10:11.944
You find him
a pretty ghoulfriend?

10:16.816 --> 10:18.651
SARAH JANE: Tell me,
why are you so determined

10:18.718 --> 10:20.419
to believe in
the supernatural?

10:20.486 --> 10:21.954
You're a scientist.

10:22.021 --> 10:23.756
Your father was
nominated for the
Nobel Prize for Physics.

10:23.823 --> 10:25.825
You must know it's nonsense.

10:25.891 --> 10:29.862
TOBY: When I was six years
old, something used to
come into my room.

10:29.929 --> 10:30.963
Something?

10:31.964 --> 10:34.967
Something grey, with no face.

10:37.903 --> 10:42.942
It stood and watched me,
all night.

10:43.009 --> 10:46.579
And don't try to tell me
it was a dream,
like my father did.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.317
I pleaded with him
to let me sleep
in another room.

10:51.384 --> 10:53.753
I begged him

10:53.819 --> 10:55.087
and I cried,

10:55.287 --> 10:56.922
but he wouldn't let me.

10:59.492 --> 11:00.926
I've never
forgiven him for that.

11:01.660 --> 11:02.795
It's okay.

11:06.198 --> 11:07.933
Shh!
Hey, Darkening!

11:10.369 --> 11:11.937
Where are you hiding?

11:13.205 --> 11:14.974
We've come to...

11:15.041 --> 11:16.742
Bust you!

11:16.809 --> 11:18.377
Yeah, well, I'd feel
a whole lot better

11:18.444 --> 11:21.247
if I was wearing
a Ghostbusters
proton pack right now.

11:21.313 --> 11:24.150
Yeah. I know what you mean.

11:24.216 --> 11:27.987
They even made
boiler suits look cool.

11:28.054 --> 11:31.590
Talking of which,
is it getting cold in here?

11:31.657 --> 11:33.893
I thought that was just me.

11:33.959 --> 11:36.595
Sarah Jane would say
it's psychological.

11:36.662 --> 11:40.199
I suppose she's right,
isn't she? About ghosts.

11:40.266 --> 11:44.503
If Darkening's an alien,
I mean, he looks just like us.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.440
Some aliens are like us.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.009
The Doctor looked human.

11:50.076 --> 11:51.177
(EXPLOSION)

11:51.243 --> 11:52.778
What was that?

11:55.047 --> 11:56.515
I don't know.

11:56.582 --> 11:58.517
Noisy neighbours?

11:58.584 --> 11:59.819
(EXPLOSIONS CONTINUE)

11:59.885 --> 12:01.053
It's getting closer!

12:01.120 --> 12:01.954
Come on!

12:07.460 --> 12:09.462
I think it's following us!

12:23.742 --> 12:25.010
(SQUEAKING)

12:36.021 --> 12:37.923
Something tells me
we're not alone in here.

12:47.733 --> 12:49.735
I think Darkening's got us
right where he wanted us.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.075
Yeah,
we're snookered all right.

12:57.977 --> 12:59.011
Get down!

13:05.384 --> 13:06.619
We have to get out of here.

13:06.685 --> 13:08.254
No, no, wait! Not that way!

13:08.320 --> 13:11.223
Whatever chased us in here
is still out there!

13:11.290 --> 13:13.926
Oh, it's stuck!
Come on, come on!

13:17.396 --> 13:18.931
Clyde?
Got it!

13:20.933 --> 13:22.034
Look out!

13:24.970 --> 13:27.473
I'm never playing pool again!

13:30.809 --> 13:33.812
What was it Sarah Jane
said we shouldn't do?

13:33.879 --> 13:35.514
Whatever happened?

13:36.615 --> 13:38.017
Don't go outside.

13:43.255 --> 13:44.156
(GROWLING)

13:46.292 --> 13:47.660
It's locked!

13:48.561 --> 13:50.329
Hey! Let us in!

13:50.396 --> 13:52.298
Sarah Jane's in the tunnels,
she can't hear you.

13:52.364 --> 13:53.666
What was that?
(SCREECHING)

13:54.200 --> 13:55.267
(GROWLING)

13:55.334 --> 13:57.236
Could just be a fox.

13:57.303 --> 13:58.837
Or whatever Sarah Jane
said was out here.

13:59.772 --> 14:02.541
(GROWLING)

14:02.608 --> 14:03.842
Come on!
There's got to
be another way in.

14:06.245 --> 14:07.680
Nobody home.

14:08.814 --> 14:10.382
That's a good start.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.218
It's freezing.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.853
We're underground.

14:32.838 --> 14:34.907
What is that?

14:34.974 --> 14:38.377
Exactly what I expected,
alien technology.

14:38.444 --> 14:41.947
It's like a computer
built from brass and iron.

14:42.014 --> 14:43.182
I don't think it's a computer.

14:43.249 --> 14:44.817
I've seen
something like it before.

14:44.883 --> 14:46.619
I think it's some sort of
trans-dimensional accelerator.

14:48.454 --> 14:50.055
I don't understand.

14:50.122 --> 14:51.457
This entire
house has been turned

14:51.523 --> 14:53.759
into a portal to
another galaxy.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.467
-We're locked out!
-With whatever
attacked Sarah Jane.

15:01.533 --> 15:02.868
This is not good, Clyde.

15:02.935 --> 15:03.936
(GROWLING)

15:05.838 --> 15:08.841
No. That's not good.

15:09.275 --> 15:10.676
Come on!

15:10.743 --> 15:12.044
The pavilion!

15:13.545 --> 15:14.847
It all makes sense.

15:14.913 --> 15:16.548
Erasmus Darkening is an alien.

15:16.615 --> 15:19.618
And over 300 years ago,
he was trapped here on Earth.

15:19.685 --> 15:21.687
So he pretended
to be an alchemist,

15:21.754 --> 15:23.822
finding the secret of turning
the lead into gold?

15:23.889 --> 15:27.393
And all the time he
was really building this,
a way to get home.

15:27.459 --> 15:29.895
It works by bending
one dimension over another

15:29.962 --> 15:31.063
and opening a doorway through.

15:31.130 --> 15:32.665
A portal.

15:32.731 --> 15:36.235
Professor Rivers has what...
Gone through it?

15:36.302 --> 15:38.937
I think something went wrong
300 years ago,

15:39.004 --> 15:41.707
it's been malfunctioning
ever since.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.277
And Darkening's
somehow manipulating
the accelerator's powers.

15:45.344 --> 15:47.713
He's channelling it.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.848
You're saying
all these ghosts...

15:52.584 --> 15:53.686
Are living people?

15:57.489 --> 15:59.558
Trapped between dimensions.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.595
What happens if
we turn it off?

16:03.662 --> 16:04.963
The disappearances
will stop, but

16:05.164 --> 16:06.799
those people will
be lost for ever.

16:07.766 --> 16:09.535
Including Celeste Rivers.

16:13.339 --> 16:14.940
Quickly, Clyde!

16:19.611 --> 16:20.913
(GROWLING)

16:24.650 --> 16:27.619
-It's not exactly the Alamo.
-I hope not.
They got into the Alamo.

16:27.686 --> 16:29.688
Yeah. Well, it'll have to do.

16:29.755 --> 16:31.824
There was
something in those bushes,
I'm sure of it.

16:31.890 --> 16:34.393
The trouble with tonight is,
it doesn't matter
what you shut out,

16:34.460 --> 16:36.528
you never know what you're
locking yourself in with.

16:36.595 --> 16:37.863
Great.

16:37.930 --> 16:40.399
I'm sorry.
Thanks for that thought.

16:40.466 --> 16:42.368
I just hope we gave Sarah Jane
a chance to fix

16:42.434 --> 16:45.070
whatever's going on here.

16:45.137 --> 16:47.539
Is there some way
of reversing it?

16:47.606 --> 16:49.141
Possibly.

16:49.208 --> 16:52.311
I've seen trans-dimensional
accelerators before.

16:52.378 --> 16:55.381
I travelled in
something that used
the same principle for years.

16:55.447 --> 16:56.915
You did what?

16:56.982 --> 16:59.451
Oh, there are so many things
out there more exciting

16:59.518 --> 17:01.587
than ghost hunting, Toby.

17:01.653 --> 17:02.955
Who exactly are you?

17:03.922 --> 17:05.124
Nobody special.

17:06.157 --> 17:06.959
Wherever he is now,

17:07.159 --> 17:08.660
Erasmus Darkening
must once have

17:08.727 --> 17:11.497
been a very,
very clever scientist.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.732
My mind is a colossus,
Miss Smith.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.970
Time is meaningless to me.

17:18.170 --> 17:23.509
I have
contemplated the mysteries,
the physics of the universe,

17:23.575 --> 17:27.378
of time, of life itself.

17:27.445 --> 17:30.249
Every being that
has become part

17:30.315 --> 17:34.286
of my dominion
feeds my existence.

17:34.353 --> 17:35.654
You mean
the accelerator is powered

17:35.854 --> 17:37.689
by the lives of
the people it takes.

17:37.756 --> 17:41.126
No one dies here.
I thought you understood that.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.896
The accelerator's malfunction
transformed this house

17:43.962 --> 17:46.131
into a gateway to eternity.

17:46.198 --> 17:48.734
It's not a gateway,
it's a trap!

17:48.801 --> 17:51.570
You're using the accelerator
to steal life energy

17:51.637 --> 17:53.238
to give you immortality.

17:53.305 --> 17:58.477
And soon, you too
shall be taken unto me.

17:58.544 --> 18:00.913
No one can escape the house.

18:02.581 --> 18:04.316
And it is
a better fate than that

18:04.383 --> 18:07.019
faced by your young friends.

18:07.085 --> 18:09.655
Clyde and Rani?
Where are they?

18:09.721 --> 18:12.724
The accelerator was not
entirely successful,

18:14.092 --> 18:17.162
but it did open a gateway
for something.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.235
The creature outside!

18:23.302 --> 18:24.970
Oh no, in the grounds!

18:27.639 --> 18:30.375
Well, if there was
anything out there,

18:30.442 --> 18:32.010
I think it's gone.

18:32.077 --> 18:33.912
Maybe we should
make a break for it?

18:33.979 --> 18:35.547
Yeah.
Sarah Jane might need us.

18:35.614 --> 18:36.615
(GROWLING)

18:38.484 --> 18:39.451
What was that?

18:41.453 --> 18:42.955
There's something up there.

18:43.755 --> 18:44.923
(GROWLING)

18:50.529 --> 18:51.730
(GROWLING)

18:51.797 --> 18:53.432
Oh, that's it,
we're getting out of here!

18:53.499 --> 18:54.433
(DOOR BANGING)

18:55.634 --> 18:57.936
(TAPPING)

18:59.037 --> 19:00.105
(DOOR RATTLING)

19:00.172 --> 19:01.874
(GROWLING)

19:01.940 --> 19:03.609
I reckon that's what
Sarah Jane
was talking about.

19:03.675 --> 19:04.943
(TAPPING)

19:06.478 --> 19:07.913
Well, at least it's polite.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.914
(GROWLING)

19:09.815 --> 19:11.583
What is it?

19:11.650 --> 19:13.218
(DOOR RATTLES)

19:13.285 --> 19:14.353
I don't know.
But I'm pretty sure

19:14.419 --> 19:16.154
it's not from around here.

19:17.022 --> 19:18.690
(DOOR RATTLES)

19:18.757 --> 19:19.958
Clyde,
it's gonna get in any minute.

19:20.158 --> 19:21.193
We need a plan.

19:21.260 --> 19:22.160
No, no, no, not a plan.

19:22.227 --> 19:24.129
What we need are
a couple of oars.

19:27.966 --> 19:29.968
Right. Whatever's out there,
it's not

19:30.168 --> 19:34.206
exactly bright, is it?
I mean, it could get through
that door, no problem.

19:34.273 --> 19:36.041
You're right, we can take it.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.343
(RATTLING)

19:38.410 --> 19:39.411
Whatever it is.

19:39.478 --> 19:41.313
Wherever it's from.

19:41.380 --> 19:42.514
(GROWLING)

19:42.581 --> 19:45.083
It's him 'oar' us.

19:47.252 --> 19:48.287
(GROWLING)

19:48.353 --> 19:49.254
Are you ready?

19:50.622 --> 19:51.924
Bring it on.

19:52.858 --> 19:53.926
(CREATURE SCREAMING)

19:54.927 --> 19:56.595
What's going on?

20:10.275 --> 20:11.944
Time runs short.

20:15.414 --> 20:19.117
-Oh, Sarah Jane.
-Oh, Rani! Thank heavens
you're all right.

20:19.184 --> 20:22.154
Lord Marchwood saved us,
and brought us
back into the house.

20:23.622 --> 20:26.458
You are Lord Marchwood?

20:26.525 --> 20:28.126
Nothing dies in
Darkening's dominion

20:28.193 --> 20:31.029
and nothing lives.
I have done what
I could to save

20:31.096 --> 20:33.899
people from this cursed house
and from Darkening's power.

20:33.966 --> 20:37.035
You tried to save us
by scaring us away?

20:37.102 --> 20:39.504
The poltergeist activity.
It was you?

20:39.571 --> 20:41.673
Look at these EMF readings.

20:41.740 --> 20:44.309
Wow, your lordship,
you are smoking!

20:44.376 --> 20:46.945
If this was a seismometer
and you were a volcano,

20:47.012 --> 20:48.947
we'd all be running away
with our hair on fire.

20:49.014 --> 20:52.718
Let me look at that.
That's extraordinary.

20:52.784 --> 20:54.586
What is this sorcerer's box?

20:54.653 --> 20:58.357
Oh, this isn't sorcery,
this is science.

20:58.423 --> 21:00.559
That's right. And I think
it's given me an idea

21:00.626 --> 21:04.429
how we can defeat Darkening.
But Lord Marchwood,
we're going to need your help.

21:04.496 --> 21:08.367
I have brought this curse
upon my house, and my family.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.769
I would do
anything to lift it.

21:10.836 --> 21:13.805
Toby, how much electrical
cabling do you have?

21:17.643 --> 21:19.211
Darkening!

21:19.277 --> 21:22.147
Hear me, magician!

21:22.214 --> 21:26.385
The curse you have cast
upon this house ends tonight.

21:26.451 --> 21:29.187
For over 300 years
I have sought my children

21:29.388 --> 21:31.590
and watched you take
soul after soul.

21:31.657 --> 21:33.025
But no more!

21:34.159 --> 21:36.628
And you will stop me?

21:36.695 --> 21:38.797
Was it not you,
Marchwood, that

21:38.864 --> 21:40.966
brought all this
upon your house?

21:41.166 --> 21:43.335
It was your hand that took
innocent people

21:43.402 --> 21:47.806
from the village, Darkening,
and cast them into whatever
infernal place they went,

21:47.873 --> 21:49.608
your hand that took
Elizabeth and Joseph.

21:52.244 --> 21:54.246
My children!

21:54.312 --> 21:56.848
It was your hand
that sought to strike me

21:56.915 --> 22:00.886
and take my life
and founded my dominion.

22:07.325 --> 22:10.796
DARKENING: <i>You attacked me,</i>
<i>you damaged my device.</i>

22:10.862 --> 22:14.366
<i>You caused all</i>
<i>that has happened here.</i>

22:14.433 --> 22:15.934
You took my children.

22:17.636 --> 22:20.605
I wanted only to return home.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.842
But you stopped
my experiments.

22:25.477 --> 22:26.812
Lord Marchwood
has to get Darkening

22:26.878 --> 22:28.914
to step into
the electro-magnetic field.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.148
You took innocent people

22:30.215 --> 22:31.450
and dispatched
their living souls

22:31.516 --> 22:33.118
to the netherworld.

22:36.488 --> 22:39.658
But tonight I end this curse.

22:39.725 --> 22:42.861
Energy can neither be created
or destroyed, only changed.

22:42.928 --> 22:44.229
Every time Lord
Marchwood attacked

22:44.296 --> 22:46.531
that creature outside
he absorbed its energy.

22:46.598 --> 22:48.433
That's why
the EMF meter spiked.

22:48.500 --> 22:50.969
The electricity creates
its own magnetic field.

22:51.036 --> 22:52.537
It will trap
Darkening and absorb him.

22:52.604 --> 22:54.306
And just turn him
into electricity?

22:54.372 --> 22:56.074
But he has to
step into our trap.

22:56.141 --> 22:59.811
-What about Marchwood?
-If he's in it,
he'll be destroyed.

23:05.684 --> 23:06.618
Meet me, Darkening.

23:07.552 --> 23:09.955
You cannot harm me, Marchwood.

23:11.256 --> 23:12.124
Then meet me.

23:14.292 --> 23:16.428
I know that you are not a man.

23:16.495 --> 23:18.930
But perhaps just this once,
act like one.

23:24.836 --> 23:27.939
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

23:32.144 --> 23:38.917
Did you think I would be
so easily vanquished,
Miss Smith?

23:40.919 --> 23:44.122
I told you,
my intellect is a colossus.

23:45.957 --> 23:47.893
How could you
think I would not see

23:47.959 --> 23:51.129
through so
transparent a stratagem?

23:53.131 --> 23:56.935
You disappoint me,
Sarah Jane Smith.

23:58.403 --> 24:00.505
I never like to disappoint.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.114
Get back!

24:17.155 --> 24:19.491
Eternity!

24:21.293 --> 24:25.063
I have lost
eternity!

24:30.435 --> 24:31.203
(TOBY YELLING)

24:45.116 --> 24:46.251
Are you all right?

24:46.318 --> 24:48.086
I'm fine, thank you.

24:49.487 --> 24:50.755
Darkening, has he gone?

24:50.822 --> 24:52.023
I think so.

24:52.090 --> 24:55.460
The magnetic
field blew his fuse.

24:55.527 --> 24:56.962
That's the trouble with having
a colossal intellect,

24:57.162 --> 24:59.531
you think you're so much
cleverer than everyone else,

24:59.598 --> 25:00.699
never consider
what other people

25:00.765 --> 25:03.301
might be hiding
up their sleeves.

25:03.368 --> 25:04.502
And Lord Marchwood
and his children,

25:04.569 --> 25:06.504
And Professor Rivers?
have they gone?

25:06.571 --> 25:09.808
Professor Rivers: <i>What have</i>
<i>you done with my equipment?</i>

25:09.875 --> 25:12.777
Do you have any idea how much
this equipment is worth?

25:12.844 --> 25:14.179
Yes, I know, Professor.
I'm sorry.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.447
We have just
witnessed the most

25:15.513 --> 25:17.716
amazing phenomena
in this house

25:17.782 --> 25:19.517
and do we have
any record of it?

25:19.584 --> 25:22.220
No. But, on the other hand
Professor,
it wasn't paranormal,

25:22.287 --> 25:23.788
it was alien.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.657
I give up. I give up.

25:27.659 --> 25:30.395
The accelerator
was synchronised
with Darkening's energies.

25:30.462 --> 25:32.864
When the magnetic field
destroyed him,
it must of overloaded,

25:32.931 --> 25:34.933
sending Professor Rivers back.

25:36.167 --> 25:39.938
But what about all the others?

25:40.005 --> 25:43.742
They wanted to be released.
At least their nightmare
is over.

25:43.808 --> 25:46.378
Well, I can't leave
Darkening's device as it is.

25:46.444 --> 25:47.913
I have to take care of it.

25:48.780 --> 25:49.915
Permanently.

25:55.287 --> 25:58.223
What about Lord Marchwood
and his children?

25:58.290 --> 26:00.492
Do you think they
found each other?

26:00.558 --> 26:01.893
I don't know.

26:04.129 --> 26:05.096
Come on.

26:08.700 --> 26:11.303
Well,
I'm not sure that exercise

26:11.369 --> 26:14.606
proved or disproved anything
as regards the paranormal.

26:14.673 --> 26:17.208
But it certainly
was interesting.

26:17.275 --> 26:19.477
I'll look forward
to the next time.

26:19.544 --> 26:21.980
Me, too.

26:22.047 --> 26:23.915
I just wanted to thank you,
Miss Smith.

26:23.982 --> 26:25.417
What for?

26:25.483 --> 26:28.019
Well, let's say you've
broadened my horizons.

26:28.086 --> 26:30.388
Maybe I shouldn't
be looking for ghosts,

26:30.455 --> 26:32.991
I should be looking
to the stars instead.

26:33.058 --> 26:34.859
It's a wonderful universe,
Toby,

26:34.926 --> 26:36.294
and no matter how much
you think you know,

26:36.361 --> 26:38.697
it will always have
one more surprise for us.

26:38.763 --> 26:39.731
Don't ever forget that.

26:40.565 --> 26:41.700
I won't.

26:41.766 --> 26:42.968
(ENGINE STARTS)

26:54.846 --> 26:57.749
So that's it, then?
No more haunted house.

26:57.816 --> 26:59.351
Weren't you paying attention?

26:59.417 --> 27:01.753
There never was
a haunted house.

27:01.820 --> 27:03.221
It was just an alien

27:03.288 --> 27:07.058
with a trans-dimensional
accelerator on the blink.

27:07.125 --> 27:09.961
So, no such thing as
ghosts then, Sarah Jane?

27:13.732 --> 27:14.933
That's right.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.936
No such thing as ghosts.

27:38.156 --> 27:42.260
Tomorrow morning,
this entire class
will be the first to see...

27:42.327 --> 27:43.795
The Mona Lisa.

27:45.363 --> 27:46.431
Ha, ha, ha, ha!

27:46.498 --> 27:48.266
The Mona Lisa has been stolen!

27:48.333 --> 27:50.769
When I act like a real
teenager you want me
to be perfect again,

27:50.835 --> 27:53.238
the way the Bane made me!

27:53.304 --> 27:55.507
LUKE: <i>Whatever we're dealing</i>
<i>with, it's more than</i>
<i>just an art thing.</i>

27:55.573 --> 27:57.208
Mum!
Sarah Jane!

27:57.275 --> 27:58.209
Aah!
