22:38.661 --> 22:41.577
Eucalyptus is in the ICU.
I have to go.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.015
[door opens]

22:45.189 --> 22:46.756
[sighs]

22:46.887 --> 22:49.237
[door closes]

22:49.411 --> 22:51.152
[monitor beeping rapidly]

22:52.588 --> 22:53.676
Status update?

22:53.850 --> 22:55.678
He's getting harder
to ventilate.

22:57.071 --> 22:59.116
Pressure is reading
artificially high.

22:59.247 --> 23:00.683
Let's increase the PEEP to 16

23:00.814 --> 23:03.120
and set the driving
pressure alarm to 60.

23:03.251 --> 23:05.253
-How's his urine output?
-Not good.

23:05.340 --> 23:07.516
He needs more fluids
and more blood.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.475
Uh, let's prep his neck
for another line.

23:13.261 --> 23:15.132
The bullet destroyed his kidney,

23:15.263 --> 23:17.134
so if he wants to survive
the next 48 hours,

23:17.308 --> 23:19.920
he'll need dialysis
pretty much around the clock.

23:20.050 --> 23:21.661
Page renal, Juliet.

23:21.791 --> 23:23.793
You'll have to give up
your other patients today.

23:23.924 --> 23:25.360
You're on Eucalyptus watch

23:25.491 --> 23:27.928
-for the rest of your shift.
-Yes, Dr. Sullivan.

23:28.058 --> 23:29.582
You're putting him on

23:29.712 --> 23:31.366
a "one nurse to one patient"
ratio?

23:31.497 --> 23:33.499
We're short on nurses
to begin with.

23:33.629 --> 23:34.717
He needs real-time monitoring.

23:34.891 --> 23:36.153
And dialysis as well?

23:36.327 --> 23:37.590
[stammers] Do we even have
a machine available?

23:37.720 --> 23:39.418
We do, but it's our last one.

23:41.463 --> 23:43.944
Look, I will try
to manage his care

23:44.118 --> 23:45.815
and keep costs low, but if we
don't throw everything at him

23:45.946 --> 23:48.035
right now, he dies.

23:49.863 --> 23:51.517
Of course.

23:51.647 --> 23:52.996
Do what you have to do,

23:53.083 --> 23:55.216
and-and thank you.

24:02.049 --> 24:03.746
Hey.

24:05.269 --> 24:07.968
Sorry it took so long.

24:08.098 --> 24:10.318
Devon's been an angel,
but I am glad you're back.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.189
How we doing?

24:12.363 --> 24:14.975
Vitals are good. We're having
some small contractions.

24:15.149 --> 24:16.846
Maybe I don't need a caesarean.

24:18.282 --> 24:20.154
I can give birth naturally.

24:20.284 --> 24:21.547
I'm afraid that's not
in the cards.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.418
Cervix is still only
at one centimeter,

24:23.549 --> 24:25.638
and these contractions aren't
coming at regular intervals,

24:25.812 --> 24:27.553
so I'm fairly certain
they're Braxton Hicks.

24:27.727 --> 24:29.206
It's a false labor, Padma.

24:29.380 --> 24:32.209
But the good news is,
our OR schedule has opened up,

24:32.383 --> 24:33.559
so your C-section
is back on the board.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.212
Oh, thank God.

24:35.386 --> 24:36.518
GABBI:
I'm gonna go get ready.

24:36.649 --> 24:38.302
Someone will bring you down
very soon.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.696
-PADMA: Okay.
-Those twins will be here
any minute now.

24:44.004 --> 24:45.527
You ready?

24:46.528 --> 24:47.877
-Yeah.
-Okay.

24:51.098 --> 24:52.795
[monitor beeping rapidly]

24:52.926 --> 24:54.449
What's going on?

24:54.580 --> 24:55.972
His pressure was soft,
but it just tanked.

24:56.103 --> 24:57.321
Look at his abdomen.

24:57.452 --> 24:58.671
[sighs] Damn it.

25:00.107 --> 25:01.674
Dialysis isn't working?

25:01.848 --> 25:03.371
No, he doesn't have enough blood
to make it through the circuit.

25:03.545 --> 25:05.460
It's pooling in his abdomen.

25:05.634 --> 25:07.593
Let's pause dialysis
and return what we can.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.682
Get two more units
of blood up now.

25:09.856 --> 25:11.248
I'm having trouble again
with the ventilation.

25:11.422 --> 25:13.424
Got bloody secretions
from the ET tube.

25:13.555 --> 25:15.470
Looks like he's bleeding
around the line. Guy's a mess.

25:15.601 --> 25:17.472
CADE:
We can get him back to normal.
Let's get two

25:17.646 --> 25:20.083
-of FFP, some platelets, and...
-Dr. Sullivan,

25:20.170 --> 25:22.695
the wound vac.

25:22.869 --> 25:25.611
Canister's full. The blood's
backing up into his abdomen.

25:25.698 --> 25:27.787
His internal bleeding is
out of control.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.702
He needs the OR.

25:29.832 --> 25:31.399
Page AJ.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.748
Tell him we're coming in hot.

25:34.271 --> 25:35.795
Again.

25:46.980 --> 25:48.198
LEELA:
In. Out.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.026
In. Out. You're gonna see

25:50.157 --> 25:51.375
your babies soon--
just focus on that.

25:51.506 --> 25:52.812
My baby boys.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.291
Hold up, guys.

25:54.422 --> 25:56.511
I am so sorry, but I'm afraid

25:56.642 --> 25:58.774
the twins are gonna have to stay
in there a little longer.

25:58.861 --> 26:00.297
-What?
-Why?

26:00.428 --> 26:02.430
We got bumped out of the OR.
Another emergency.

26:02.517 --> 26:05.041
Something to do with
the GSW again.

26:05.172 --> 26:07.653
[pagers ringing]

26:08.654 --> 26:09.872
Eucalyptus.

26:10.003 --> 26:10.786
OR One.

26:12.092 --> 26:13.093
What?

26:14.529 --> 26:16.879
I'm so sorry. I have to go,
but I will be back, okay?

26:17.053 --> 26:18.011
Wh-When?

26:18.141 --> 26:19.665
Soon.

26:20.317 --> 26:21.797
Soon?

26:21.884 --> 26:25.105
Go. We can handle this.
We'll take care of it.

26:25.279 --> 26:27.237
I will let you know the second
we're back on the schedule.

26:27.368 --> 26:29.196
[whimpers]

26:29.326 --> 26:31.285
Hey, don't worry,

26:31.415 --> 26:32.765
I will not leave you again.

26:36.290 --> 26:38.335
What do you mean "delayed"?

26:38.509 --> 26:40.294
I've been waiting months
for a new hip.

26:40.424 --> 26:43.079
I'm so sorry, Mr. Garret,
but unexpected emergencies

26:43.210 --> 26:45.342
can have a ripple effect
on scheduled surgeries.

26:45.516 --> 26:47.997
-Will it even be today?
-You will get your new hip,

26:48.171 --> 26:49.999
I promise, but we have to give
life-threatening cases priority.

26:50.130 --> 26:52.741
No. Cancel it.

26:52.872 --> 26:54.569
We need that room
five minutes ago.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.571
We're shifting things around.

26:56.745 --> 26:58.486
I'm sorry.
We're doing the best that we...

26:58.660 --> 27:00.270
Wait, Dr. Sutton.

27:00.357 --> 27:01.663
I've got to scrub in on the GSW.

27:01.794 --> 27:03.143
The bullet is lodged
in his spine.

27:03.317 --> 27:05.275
Dr. Miller says his myomectomy
needs to go.

27:08.017 --> 27:10.367
Everything that can push
is pushing.

27:10.498 --> 27:11.891
We've got no choice.

27:16.852 --> 27:19.289
How'd we get this low
on AB negative?

27:19.376 --> 27:21.074
We were low to start, then
the GSW went through 50 units.

27:21.204 --> 27:22.728
50?

27:22.902 --> 27:24.599
[mutters softly]

27:24.730 --> 27:27.384
Call scheduling, see if they can
bump the coronary bypass

27:27.515 --> 27:29.517
-in OR Three.
-Bump a bypass?

27:29.604 --> 27:32.563
That'll free up four units,
minimum.

27:32.694 --> 27:35.044
COORDINATOR:
This is Kay down in blood bank.
I need to bump a bypass.

27:41.094 --> 27:42.269
I'm worried about Padma.

27:42.399 --> 27:44.184
Same here, but she'll be okay.

27:44.358 --> 27:47.274
Flights get delayed,
you still make your destination.

27:47.404 --> 27:48.797
Eventually.

27:48.928 --> 27:51.060
After sitting at O'Hare
for ten miserable hours,

27:51.191 --> 27:52.845
and sometimes they say,
"Get a hotel room,"

27:53.019 --> 27:54.324
-but then all the
hotels are booked.
-AUSTIN: Jessica.

27:59.068 --> 28:00.983
All right.

28:01.114 --> 28:03.072
Removing the wound vac.

28:05.509 --> 28:07.337
[sighs] Damn,
that's a lot of blood.

28:07.424 --> 28:09.731
All right, set up extra suction.
Laps to me.

28:13.953 --> 28:16.172
And massive transfusion
protocol, now.

28:16.303 --> 28:17.739
[monitors beeping rapidly]

28:19.654 --> 28:21.221
Where's he bleeding from
this time?

28:21.308 --> 28:22.875
AUSTIN:
Like I said, the bullet
went everywhere.

28:23.005 --> 28:24.485
We have to approach this
systematically.

28:24.572 --> 28:26.008
Okay, you lead, I'll follow.

28:26.139 --> 28:28.315
Okay, repack every quadrant,

28:28.445 --> 28:31.666
-and then remove them clockwise
until we find it.
-Okay.

28:41.458 --> 28:42.938
You're doing great.

28:46.637 --> 28:49.205
I was really hoping to never
have to see this room again.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.381
Honestly, same here.

28:53.383 --> 28:55.821
[gasping]

28:55.995 --> 28:57.431
Devon.

28:57.561 --> 29:00.042
Something's happening.
[pained gasp]

29:00.173 --> 29:01.478
[monitor beeping rapidly]

29:01.652 --> 29:04.525
Oh, it hurts under my belly--
a lot.

29:04.612 --> 29:05.961
Dr. Johnson!

29:06.048 --> 29:08.050
Oh, God!

29:08.224 --> 29:10.270
I've got you.
It's gonna be okay.

29:10.357 --> 29:12.620
-What's happening?
-Fetal heart rates are dropping.

29:12.707 --> 29:14.709
She has lower left
abdominal pain.

29:15.797 --> 29:19.192
[crying, groaning]

29:19.279 --> 29:20.410
She's bleeding from her uterus.

29:20.584 --> 29:21.847
-An abruption?
-Yes.

29:22.021 --> 29:23.674
Placenta's detached
from the uterine wall.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.633
She needs an OR right away, but,
Devon, there's none available.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.287
I'll make one available.

29:27.417 --> 29:28.723
[yells in pain]

29:31.857 --> 29:33.946
Hey, we need an OR right away.

29:34.076 --> 29:35.251
I'm sorry, Devon.
Every room's booked solid.

29:35.382 --> 29:37.079
Padma is having an abruption.
If we don't get

29:37.253 --> 29:39.647
those babies out now, they die,
maybe she does, too.

29:41.910 --> 29:43.825
Cancel the appendectomy
in OR Two.

29:43.956 --> 29:45.871
Prep it for a C-section.

29:46.001 --> 29:47.133
Thank you.

29:48.438 --> 29:49.309
NURSE:
Cancel OR Two.

29:49.439 --> 29:51.615
Need for C-section.

29:52.834 --> 29:55.054
[crying]:
Oh, God!

29:55.184 --> 29:57.056
It hurts!

29:57.186 --> 29:58.579
We're almost there, okay?

29:59.623 --> 30:01.060
She's going into shock.

30:01.190 --> 30:02.365
Padma, I'm here. I got you.

30:11.461 --> 30:12.767
Ten blade.

30:38.010 --> 30:39.228
Give me fundal pressure.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.935
[baby crying]

30:53.939 --> 30:56.724
Baby number one is out.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.258
Reach.

31:09.389 --> 31:11.391
Baby number two.

31:11.565 --> 31:13.306
[baby crying]

31:21.401 --> 31:23.969
Okay, now, Padma, she's bleeding
heavily from the abruption.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.535
Get me four units of blood
to catch up.

31:25.666 --> 31:28.190
We're out of AB negative.

31:28.321 --> 31:29.539
In the entire hospital?

31:29.626 --> 31:31.977
Yes, it was used up
from the gunshot wound.

31:32.151 --> 31:32.978
Oh, my God.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.980
Let's try uncrossmatched blood.

31:35.110 --> 31:36.851
Okay, but we need it now.

31:38.635 --> 31:41.856
Add TXA, more oxytocin.

31:41.987 --> 31:43.162
I need help. Page trauma now.

31:50.517 --> 31:52.301
I need four units
of uncrossmatched right now.

31:57.002 --> 31:59.004
Two units are all we have left.

32:04.748 --> 32:07.490
[monitor alarms chiming]

32:12.408 --> 32:15.585
OB is paging trauma to OR Two.
Padma's had an abruption.

32:15.672 --> 32:17.457
-An abruption?
-She's bleeding out.

32:19.546 --> 32:23.158
-[sighs] She could die.
-Go. I'll finish here
and join you as soon as I can.

32:25.726 --> 32:27.989
-What can I do?
-Help me keep this
son of a bitch alive.

32:28.120 --> 32:29.034
It's not his fault he got shot.

32:29.164 --> 32:30.818
Are you certain of that?
Because I'm not.

32:30.905 --> 32:33.255
[monitor alarms blaring]

32:33.386 --> 32:35.214
His pressures are tanking.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.042
AUSTIN:
All right, it's coming
from the liver.

32:37.129 --> 32:38.782
We need to do a hepatectomy
to control the bleeding.

32:38.913 --> 32:40.784
Clamps to Dr. Sutton.

32:46.747 --> 32:49.228
[gasps] Padma.

32:53.449 --> 32:55.625
-Two units of uncrossmatched.
-That's it?

32:55.756 --> 32:57.453
It's all they had.

32:57.584 --> 32:59.020
Have you found the source?

32:59.151 --> 33:01.109
Uh, not yet.
She had an abruption.

33:01.240 --> 33:02.719
I treated her for atony.
I'm looking for the laceration.

33:02.850 --> 33:04.808
CHU:
Now she's bleeding
uncontrollably.

33:04.939 --> 33:06.723
These two units won't last long.

33:06.854 --> 33:08.638
[monitors beeping]

33:13.426 --> 33:15.080
Leela.

33:15.254 --> 33:16.646
You've done this
a hundred times.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.520
Here's what we're gonna do.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.043
Get better exposure.
Laps, suction.

33:22.174 --> 33:24.350
-Retractors to me.
-Ring forceps here.

33:26.613 --> 33:29.398
Tear at the uterine artery with
an extension of a hysterotomy.

33:29.529 --> 33:31.313
It's in a tough spot.
Rotate more superiorly.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.185
-This is as much as I can give.
-You're gonna have to
give me more.

33:33.315 --> 33:35.317
-I can't find the tear.
-Okay, if this doesn't work...

33:35.404 --> 33:36.536
-It will work.
-Her pressure's tanking again.

33:36.666 --> 33:38.668
-She's on two pressors.
-Leela, she's gonna code.

33:38.755 --> 33:39.887
More suction. I know where I am.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.324
I've isolated the vessel.

33:42.498 --> 33:44.109
Adding a third pressor.

33:44.283 --> 33:46.154
Get the crash cart.

33:46.285 --> 33:48.243
Wait, hang on, hang on.
Almost there, almost there.

33:53.248 --> 33:56.077
[monitors beeping]
