00:02.000 --> 00:03.800
Previously on
Witches of East End...
It's our family's Grimoire.

00:03.833 --> 00:05.466
A spell book.
We should try one.

00:05.500 --> 00:07.666
(moaning)

00:07.700 --> 00:09.366
You gonna introduce me?
Yeah.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.833
This is Freya. Freya,
this is Eva, my wife.

00:15.600 --> 00:17.033
Oh, my God.

00:18.100 --> 00:19.200
What happened?

00:19.233 --> 00:22.900
I'm losing pieces of time.

00:22.933 --> 00:24.300
I need your help.

00:24.333 --> 00:25.900
Just go.

00:27.500 --> 00:29.666
(explosion)

00:31.000 --> 00:33.033
(snaps fingers)

00:36.433 --> 00:40.800
Spirit of ashes and rebirth.

00:40.833 --> 00:43.600
Give hope for what is to come.

00:46.600 --> 00:50.500
Give honor
for that which has passed.

00:53.900 --> 00:57.333
And give always
for what is the here and now.

01:00.666 --> 01:03.633
Ex cineribus resurge.

01:03.666 --> 01:05.000
(wind whooshing)

01:16.366 --> 01:18.366
Good‐bye, Victor.

01:20.900 --> 01:22.900
(wind whooshing)

01:28.733 --> 01:30.766
Mandragora.

01:39.166 --> 01:41.933

INGRID:
Freya.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.333
Freya.

04:06.366 --> 04:08.533
Freya. Hey.

04:08.566 --> 04:09.900
(sighs)

04:09.933 --> 04:11.566
Why did you do that?

04:11.600 --> 04:13.066
What is going on?

04:13.100 --> 04:14.500
(sighs)

04:14.533 --> 04:15.800
You haven't answered
your phone in days.

04:15.833 --> 04:16.900
Are you sick
or something?

04:16.933 --> 04:19.000
No, I'm fine.

04:19.033 --> 04:20.400
I'm great.

04:20.433 --> 04:23.366
At least I was
until you just woke me up.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.900
What are you
talking about?

04:24.933 --> 04:27.700
Do you remember
that brownie recipe

04:27.733 --> 04:29.633
you used to remember
your past life?

04:29.666 --> 04:31.700
Yeah.

04:31.733 --> 04:34.733
Well, I made
my own version of it.

04:34.766 --> 04:36.566
Super concentrated.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.700
It's even stronger.

04:38.733 --> 04:40.566
Three drops on the tongue,
simple chant,

04:40.600 --> 04:42.066
think of a year, and boom.

04:42.100 --> 04:44.533
You can revisit any life
you've ever lived.

04:44.566 --> 04:47.133
So far, I've been to the '20s,
I've been to the '50s,

04:47.166 --> 04:48.966
I've been to the '70s.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.200
Well, at least, I was in the
'70s until you just woke me up.

04:52.233 --> 04:53.866
Yeah, I don't think
this is a good idea.

04:53.900 --> 04:55.633
Are you kidding me?
It's the best!

04:55.666 --> 04:57.366
You have to try it.
I already have.

04:57.400 --> 04:58.833
And it was awful.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.533
I discovered I
was in a cult.

05:00.566 --> 05:02.866
I experienced my own
death, which hurt a lot.

05:02.900 --> 05:05.500
This is dangerous, Freya.
No good can come from this.

05:05.533 --> 05:07.333
Ingrid, it already has.

05:07.366 --> 05:10.966
I have known Killian in every
life I've been to so far.

05:11.000 --> 05:13.666
He always has a different name,
sometimes Dash is there,

05:13.700 --> 05:16.400
sometimes he's not,
and they're not always brothers.

05:16.433 --> 05:18.366
But still, it's him.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.966
And every time, we fall in love.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.233
I knew he was
my soul mate.

05:23.266 --> 05:26.333
Which is why
it doesn't make sense

05:26.366 --> 05:27.566
that we're not
together now.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.366
Maybe I can use the past

05:29.400 --> 05:32.033
to figure out what that
roadblock is in the present.

05:32.066 --> 05:34.300
Is it that,
or are you using the past

05:34.333 --> 05:37.066
to hide the problems
from the here and now?

05:37.100 --> 05:39.233
(sighs)
It's both.

05:40.566 --> 05:43.033
The here and now hurts.

05:43.066 --> 05:45.200
And the past feels so good.

05:45.233 --> 05:47.966
Trust me, it's not all good.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.700
Now, will you
promise me

05:49.733 --> 05:51.633
you will throw this stuff away
before you find out

05:51.666 --> 05:53.066
something you wish
you didn't know?

05:53.100 --> 05:55.066
Yes.

05:55.100 --> 05:56.500
Good.

05:56.533 --> 05:58.533
Now get out of bed
and get to work.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.133
(sighs)
I love you.

06:00.166 --> 06:02.366
I love you, too, hard‐ass.

06:02.400 --> 06:05.633
(both laugh)

06:05.666 --> 06:08.000
(siren wailing)

06:08.033 --> 06:09.833
There's my
favorite patient.

06:09.866 --> 06:11.666
Hey, Dr. Gardiner.
Hey.

06:11.700 --> 06:13.666
Ready for this?
I guess.

06:13.700 --> 06:16.066
I mean, all I have to do
is stay asleep, right?

06:16.100 --> 06:18.333
Yeah. Just think of it
like math class.

06:18.366 --> 06:20.466
(laughs)
Exactly.

06:20.500 --> 06:23.400
But seriously,
you a little scared?

06:24.600 --> 06:26.233
All right,
well, don't be.

06:26.266 --> 06:28.900
Dr. Benson is the best surgical
oncologist we have here.

06:28.933 --> 06:30.800
(whispers): But don't
tell her I said that;

06:30.833 --> 06:32.233
her head will explode.

06:32.266 --> 06:33.700
And don't worry,

06:33.733 --> 06:35.566
Dr. Benson and I
will both be right here

06:35.600 --> 06:37.033
waiting for you
when you wake up.

06:37.066 --> 06:38.533
Okay?

06:38.566 --> 06:40.666
Thank you,
Dr. Gardiner.
Yeah.

06:40.700 --> 06:42.700
(makes explosion noise)

06:45.500 --> 06:47.966
JOANNA:
Well, now we know for sure

06:48.000 --> 06:50.466
what's been killing people
in the town.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.400
It's a Mandragora.

06:52.433 --> 06:54.466
But why would it even
come here from Asgard?

06:54.500 --> 06:55.466
They're feral creatures.

06:55.500 --> 06:57.166
Not anymore.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.400
Grandfather figured out a way
to capture and control them.

06:59.433 --> 07:01.833
He built an entire army
to do his bidding.

07:01.866 --> 07:04.500
He must've sent this one
through the portal after me.

07:04.533 --> 07:06.533
So you're saying
this Mandragora

07:06.566 --> 07:08.866
who came after you
is also going around town

07:08.900 --> 07:11.566
killing people, carving the
king's symbol into their chests.

07:11.600 --> 07:13.133
Why?

07:13.166 --> 07:15.066
They hunt and they kill;
that's what they do.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.566
That doesn't mean
it's not here for me.

07:16.600 --> 07:18.200
Doesn't prove
that it is, either.

07:18.233 --> 07:19.966
JOANNA: It doesn't
matter why it's here.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.466
We just need to find it
and get rid of it,

07:21.500 --> 07:23.033
once and for all.
We can't.

07:23.066 --> 07:25.033
Why not?
You can't just
kill a Mandragora.

07:25.066 --> 07:26.733
They're too powerful.

07:26.766 --> 07:28.900
That's why
Grandfather uses them.

07:28.933 --> 07:32.200
No one's ever fought one
and lived to tell about it.

07:32.233 --> 07:34.233
Actually, I know
someone who has.

07:44.566 --> 07:46.300
Excuse me, sir.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.900
Only employees are
allowed behind the bar.

07:48.933 --> 07:52.366
Actually, Eva and I plan to stay
in East End, so I needed a job.

07:54.066 --> 07:55.900
You're good with me
working here again, right?

07:55.933 --> 07:57.900
It won't be... awkward?

07:57.933 --> 07:59.166
Of course not.

07:59.200 --> 08:00.900
Why would it be awkward?

08:00.933 --> 08:04.700
Because we kissed and you were
almost my brother‐in‐law?

08:04.733 --> 08:06.533
Ancient history.

08:06.566 --> 08:09.866
I think you know that's not
what I'm talking about.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.366
Dash told me, Freya.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.133
About everything.

08:13.166 --> 08:15.066
What do you mean?

08:19.233 --> 08:21.466
I know you're a witch.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.900
You do?

08:22.933 --> 08:25.466
I was really angry
when I first found out.

08:25.500 --> 08:28.233
I felt like you lied to
me about who you were.

08:28.266 --> 08:31.833
So then do you know
that you're...

08:31.866 --> 08:34.133
A warlock?
Yeah, I know.

08:34.166 --> 08:36.400
And I have just
one question.

08:36.433 --> 08:37.733
Of course.
Ask me anything.

08:37.766 --> 08:39.066
When'd you
figure it out?

08:39.100 --> 08:41.366
What do you mean?

08:41.400 --> 08:43.500
When you came to see
me in Santo Domingo,

08:43.533 --> 08:45.966
did you know
about my powers?

08:46.000 --> 08:48.033
Yes.

08:48.066 --> 08:50.733
But I wasn't sure
if you knew yet.

08:50.766 --> 08:53.500
So why didn't you tell me?
That's not against the code.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.966
I know.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.466
Everything just
happened so fast.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.633
I mean, I got there,
and you were married.

08:58.666 --> 09:00.133
So you would've told me
if I wasn't married?

09:00.166 --> 09:02.500
No, no.
That's not what I meant.

09:02.533 --> 09:06.466
I just... I just wasn't sure
how to say it, I guess.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.066
Seems pretty
simple to me.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.366
You just look
me in the eye,

09:10.400 --> 09:12.866
and tell me the truth.

09:17.166 --> 09:19.133
You know what?
You're right.

09:19.166 --> 09:22.133
I should have
done that all along.

09:22.166 --> 09:24.766
From now on, I'm just
gonna tell you the truth.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.833
The truth is, I'm still...

09:28.866 --> 09:30.133
Hey, guys.

09:30.166 --> 09:31.866
KILLIAN:
Hey. What's up?

09:33.900 --> 09:35.500
We need a fold‐out couch.

09:35.533 --> 09:38.300
Pick one.
I can't decide.

09:38.333 --> 09:41.533
My family is enormous and loud.

09:41.566 --> 09:42.833
They're threatening to visit.

09:42.866 --> 09:44.733
Pero yo los
quiero mucho,

09:44.766 --> 09:46.800
porque ellos me
dieron plátanos.

09:46.833 --> 09:47.866
You speak Spanish?

09:47.900 --> 09:49.833
He's learning. For me.

09:49.866 --> 09:51.966
Except, you just said

09:52.000 --> 09:53.666
that you love them

09:53.700 --> 09:55.566
because they
gave you bananas?

09:55.600 --> 09:57.066
That's what I
meant to say.

09:57.100 --> 09:59.733
You're so adorable.

10:04.100 --> 10:05.300
Wow.

10:05.333 --> 10:06.833
We are dangerously low
on olives.

10:06.866 --> 10:09.633
I'm gonna go back
to the storeroom and grab some.

10:09.666 --> 10:11.566
It was nice to see you, Eva.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.633
Nice seeing you.

10:13.666 --> 10:16.166
I mean, that's all right.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.200
(whispers):
Come on, come on.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
Yes!

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
No.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.200
Okay.

10:39.833 --> 10:41.833
(sighs)

10:44.566 --> 10:47.233
(panting)

10:47.266 --> 10:48.466
BENSON:
Let's go again. Clear!

10:48.500 --> 10:50.033
I just got the page.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.966
I heard the surgery went okay.
What's going on?

10:52.000 --> 10:53.233
He crashed.

10:53.266 --> 10:54.333
BENSON:
Okay, let's go again.

10:54.366 --> 10:55.633
Clear!

10:55.666 --> 10:56.800
(paddles thump)

10:56.833 --> 10:57.966
DASH:
How long's he been down?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.200
BENSON:
16 minutes.

10:59.233 --> 11:01.166
16 minutes.

11:04.400 --> 11:05.800
I'm calling it.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.900
Stop compressions.

11:10.766 --> 11:13.233
Time of death 11:28.

11:18.333 --> 11:20.000
We have to speak to his mother.

11:20.033 --> 11:21.700
(sniffs)

11:21.733 --> 11:23.733
Yeah, just... give me a sec.

11:39.600 --> 11:42.200
Remotio...

11:42.233 --> 11:43.466
A Morte.

11:43.500 --> 11:48.200
Remotio A Morte.

11:51.166 --> 11:54.066
Remotio A Morte.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.466
(gasping)

11:56.500 --> 11:58.900
Dr. Benson, get over here.

12:00.866 --> 12:02.066
How did you
resuscitate him?

12:02.100 --> 12:03.333
I don't know.

12:03.366 --> 12:06.000
I was standing here,
he just woke up.

12:10.066 --> 12:11.533
BENSON (quietly):
Can you tell me your name?

12:11.566 --> 12:13.233
SAM:
Sam Jacobs.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.300
BENSON:
Do you know where you are?

12:15.333 --> 12:17.500
SAM:
The hospital.

12:23.366 --> 12:25.666
♪ ♪

12:31.626 --> 12:34.292
Where are we going?

12:34.326 --> 12:35.559
Right here.

12:37.626 --> 12:39.659
What? Is this... mystery man

12:39.692 --> 12:41.692
who fought a Mandragora
and lived to tell the tale

12:41.726 --> 12:42.959
a hot dog
vendor?

12:42.992 --> 12:44.226
(chuckles)

12:46.526 --> 12:47.692
Joanna!

12:53.859 --> 12:55.092
JOANNA:
Alex.

12:55.126 --> 12:57.126
Hi.
This is my sister, Wendy.

12:57.159 --> 12:58.492
Hi, nice to meet you.

12:58.526 --> 12:59.492
What do you want?

12:59.526 --> 13:00.359
Wha... okay.

13:00.392 --> 13:02.192
We have a problem

13:02.226 --> 13:04.959
and you're the only one I could
think of who could help us.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.692
I wouldn't come
if it wasn't a matter
of life or death.

13:07.726 --> 13:09.092
You have 15 seconds.

13:09.126 --> 13:10.626
The portal opened.

13:10.659 --> 13:12.192
A Mandragora
came through.

13:12.226 --> 13:14.292
Are you serious?

13:14.326 --> 13:16.492
It's already killed
two people in East End.

13:16.526 --> 13:18.926
You know more
about them

13:18.959 --> 13:20.492
than anyone else
I've ever met.

13:20.526 --> 13:22.692
I didn't know where else to go.

13:22.726 --> 13:25.026
I just don't want
more innocent people to die.

13:25.059 --> 13:26.926
I almost admire the fact

13:26.959 --> 13:28.692
that after all this time

13:28.726 --> 13:30.926
you have the gall
to come here

13:30.959 --> 13:32.726
and ask me for help.

13:35.992 --> 13:38.492
But you can still
go to hell, Joanna.

13:47.826 --> 13:49.026
I take it

13:49.059 --> 13:50.326
that's a "no"?

13:54.292 --> 13:55.526
Take a deep breath.

13:55.559 --> 13:57.359
(inhales)

13:57.392 --> 13:59.359
Okay, look, I know this
is a little awkward.

13:59.392 --> 14:00.692
All right?

14:00.726 --> 14:01.926
But right now
I'm Dr. Gardiner.

14:01.959 --> 14:03.792
Okay? Don't think of me as Dash.

14:03.826 --> 14:05.659
Dr. Gardiner.

14:05.692 --> 14:07.126
(both chuckle)

14:07.159 --> 14:09.126
Okay, so, uh...

14:09.159 --> 14:10.526
tell me what's
been going on.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.859
Uh, well, you've seen
the cuts on my back.

14:12.892 --> 14:15.692
I've been sleepwalking
and losing track of time.

14:15.726 --> 14:17.592
And I know my mom
can heal my injuries,

14:17.626 --> 14:19.792
but I'm worried
about why it keeps happening.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.326
Okay, well,

14:21.359 --> 14:22.959
I'll order a full blood panel.

14:22.992 --> 14:25.259
We can start there.
If there's a medical reason,

14:25.292 --> 14:26.526
we'll find it.
Thank you, Dash.

14:26.559 --> 14:29.126
I mean,
Dr. Gardiner.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.792
(both chuckle)

14:34.126 --> 14:35.359
Dash.

14:35.392 --> 14:36.192
DASH:
What's wrong?

14:36.226 --> 14:37.992
Your hands...

14:40.126 --> 14:41.326
That looks like

14:41.359 --> 14:43.326
the side effects of a spell.

14:45.326 --> 14:46.526
My...

14:46.559 --> 14:48.359
my cancer
patient...

14:48.392 --> 14:51.026
Sam, he was dying
and I started saying some words,

14:51.059 --> 14:52.959
but it wasn't even a spell
and it revived him.

14:52.992 --> 14:55.626
Wait... was he dying,

14:55.659 --> 14:57.059
or dead?

14:58.126 --> 14:59.259
Dead.

14:59.292 --> 15:02.192
Oh, shit.

15:04.726 --> 15:07.026
So why does she hate
you so much, anyway?

15:07.059 --> 15:09.426
Oh! Did you sleep
with her husband?

15:09.459 --> 15:11.126
'Cause in my experience,
chicks don't like that.

15:11.159 --> 15:13.326
It doesn't matter;
it was a long time ago.

15:14.359 --> 15:15.626
Wait, you're back?

15:15.659 --> 15:16.926
Where's the
Mandragora expert?

15:16.959 --> 15:18.626
Good question.
We don't need her.

15:18.659 --> 15:20.292
We can do this
on our own.

15:20.326 --> 15:22.026
I don't know if we can.
Are you sure
about that?

15:22.059 --> 15:23.492
We don't have a choice.

15:23.526 --> 15:24.926
(knocking at door)

15:24.959 --> 15:27.026
I'll get it.

15:28.659 --> 15:30.659
Hello?

15:30.692 --> 15:32.626
ALEX:
Where's Joanna?
Alex?

15:32.659 --> 15:35.492
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much for coming.

15:35.526 --> 15:37.659
Save it.
I'm not here for you.

15:37.692 --> 15:39.359
I just don't want
anyone else to die.

15:39.392 --> 15:42.159
Oh. You redecorated.

15:42.192 --> 15:44.092
Yeah, a few times.
It's been 35 years.

15:44.126 --> 15:45.359
I'll have
an iced tea.

15:45.392 --> 15:47.426
(snorts)
I'm not a waitress;

15:47.459 --> 15:49.459
get it yourself.
Frederick,
would you mind?

15:49.492 --> 15:52.626
So, have you found
the Mandragora's mate?

15:52.659 --> 15:54.126
What do you mean?

15:54.159 --> 15:55.426
A Mandragora
can only

15:55.459 --> 15:56.992
survive on a
parasitic diet.

15:57.026 --> 15:58.659
That's...
how it feeds.

15:58.692 --> 16:00.659
It takes in the energy
of its partner during coitus.

16:00.692 --> 16:01.959
Wait.

16:01.992 --> 16:02.992
It feeds

16:03.026 --> 16:04.259
by having sex?

16:04.292 --> 16:06.159
Oh, man, I wish I could do that.

16:06.192 --> 16:07.859
Uh, focus.
Sorry.

16:07.892 --> 16:10.092
ALEX:
They have a permanent
symbiotic relationship.

16:10.126 --> 16:11.459
A Mandragora and its
mate are connected

16:11.492 --> 16:12.692
even when they're
not together.

16:12.726 --> 16:13.959
So if you kill one...

16:13.992 --> 16:15.459
Exactly.
The other one dies, too.

16:15.492 --> 16:16.692
FREDERICK:
So maybe we should try

16:16.726 --> 16:18.192
to find
its mate.

16:18.226 --> 16:19.592
Kill them, and just
let the Mandragora die.

16:19.626 --> 16:20.826
No.

16:20.859 --> 16:22.626
We don't kill
innocents.

16:22.659 --> 16:24.026
The mate's not innocent.

16:24.059 --> 16:25.426
They're collateral damage.

16:25.459 --> 16:26.792
We'd be
saving lives,

16:26.826 --> 16:28.192
and it could take weeks,

16:28.226 --> 16:29.792
tracking them down.

16:29.826 --> 16:31.326
We don't have that kind of time.
Look, just...

16:31.359 --> 16:33.526
tell me where you
saw the Mandragora.

16:33.559 --> 16:34.792
I didn't.

16:34.826 --> 16:36.159
Well...

16:36.192 --> 16:37.759
no, not exactly.

16:37.792 --> 16:39.959
I found...

16:39.992 --> 16:42.026
one of its scales

16:42.059 --> 16:43.526
in the woods.

16:43.559 --> 16:44.959
Wow.
Yeah.

16:44.992 --> 16:47.026
I can't believe
you have this.

16:47.059 --> 16:49.092
We'll lay some
veneno linea

16:49.126 --> 16:51.159
in a perimeter around the
woods where you saw him.

16:51.192 --> 16:52.192
What is that?

16:52.226 --> 16:53.459
It's an energy field.

16:53.492 --> 16:55.092
It's like a tripwire.

16:55.126 --> 16:57.159
Once he activates it,
we can use it to track him.

16:57.192 --> 16:58.426
Follow his trail.

16:58.459 --> 16:59.692
Okay.
Let's go.

16:59.726 --> 17:00.959
All right.

17:00.992 --> 17:02.992
Let's go lay the trap.

17:03.026 --> 17:04.492
And that iced tea?

17:04.526 --> 17:06.526
Is terrible.

17:07.826 --> 17:09.559
Charming woman.

17:12.159 --> 17:14.126
Freya?

17:14.159 --> 17:15.159
You come in here?

17:37.492 --> 17:39.859
(disco music playing)

17:59.126 --> 18:00.759
I don't like the way
people are looking at you.

18:00.792 --> 18:02.026
(laughing):
Yes, you do.

18:02.059 --> 18:03.359
That's why you
bought this club:

18:03.392 --> 18:04.592
to show me off.

18:04.626 --> 18:06.826
We need some
more product.

18:06.859 --> 18:09.226
You've outdone yourself
with this batch, baby.

18:10.492 --> 18:11.326
(laughs)
(exhales)

18:11.359 --> 18:12.792
I am good.

18:12.826 --> 18:14.526
Who would have thought a witch

18:14.559 --> 18:15.792
could brew up the best coke

18:15.826 --> 18:17.492
on the Eastern Seaboard?

18:17.526 --> 18:19.192
We can barely keep up
with demand.

18:19.226 --> 18:21.459
You don't actually
need me, you know.

18:21.492 --> 18:22.692
You've got powers.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.026
I could teach you
my secret recipe,

18:24.059 --> 18:25.292
if you want.

18:25.326 --> 18:27.092
I couldn't do it like you

18:27.126 --> 18:28.326
even if I tried.

18:28.359 --> 18:30.759
You got the gift, baby.

18:30.792 --> 18:32.426
Besides, we make
a perfect team.

18:32.459 --> 18:34.359
I want to give
you the world.

18:34.392 --> 18:36.192
Anything you want.

18:36.226 --> 18:37.126
Anything
at all...

18:37.159 --> 18:38.659
it's yours.

18:40.059 --> 18:41.692
I'll be right back.

18:41.726 --> 18:43.726
♪ ♪

18:58.059 --> 19:00.692
(whoops)

19:03.659 --> 19:05.192
I thought you were
gonna tell him.
I am.

19:05.226 --> 19:06.692
You just have
to let me figure out

19:06.726 --> 19:08.192
the right way.
It's not that
difficult, Freya.

19:08.226 --> 19:09.826
Just look him in the eye
and tell him the truth:

19:09.859 --> 19:11.259
you're in love with me,
you're done with him.

19:11.292 --> 19:13.259
It's not that simple.

19:13.292 --> 19:15.026
Because you're in love
with the drugs, too.

19:15.059 --> 19:16.826
No, that's not what it is.

19:16.859 --> 19:18.792
You think I don't know?
You guys are
legends around here.

19:18.826 --> 19:20.626
Your coke's like magic.
No one can get enough.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.126
Especially you.

19:22.159 --> 19:24.359
You know, you've got
a lot of nerve.

19:24.392 --> 19:25.792
Listen to me.

19:25.826 --> 19:27.526
You are so much
better than this.

19:27.559 --> 19:28.792
You know you are.

19:28.826 --> 19:30.759
I love you.

19:30.792 --> 19:32.292
Walk away from
him, tonight.

19:32.326 --> 19:35.026
I love you, too, Bobby.

19:35.059 --> 19:38.092
I've never felt
this way about anyone.

19:38.126 --> 19:39.959
Good.

19:39.992 --> 19:42.192
Let's stop
sneaking around.

19:42.226 --> 19:44.426
Leave him
and be with me.

19:44.459 --> 19:46.859
I can't just... leave him.

19:46.892 --> 19:48.292
He's dangerous

19:48.326 --> 19:49.626
in ways you
can't understand.

19:49.659 --> 19:50.959
I'm not
scared of him.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.459
You should be.

20:08.159 --> 20:11.026
DASH:
Look, it's not like I had
a spell memorized or anything.

20:11.059 --> 20:12.659
I just started speaking Latin.

20:12.692 --> 20:14.359
You are a warlock, Dash.

20:14.392 --> 20:15.592
You start chanting in Latin,

20:15.626 --> 20:16.692
something's gonna happen.

20:16.726 --> 20:17.959
Do you remember the words?

20:17.992 --> 20:19.426
Yeah. Remotio
A Morte.

20:19.459 --> 20:21.626
It means
"banishment of death."
No.

20:21.659 --> 20:23.359
No, it means "removal

20:23.392 --> 20:24.526
of death."

20:24.559 --> 20:25.692
So? Isn't that the same thing?

20:25.726 --> 20:27.759
You can't just remove

20:27.792 --> 20:29.426
someone's death, Dash.

20:29.459 --> 20:30.692
It has to go somewhere.

20:30.726 --> 20:32.492
And this one went...

20:32.526 --> 20:35.526
Inside me.

20:35.559 --> 20:38.292
Sam's death is now
inside your body.

20:38.326 --> 20:39.859
And if we don't
get it out,

20:39.892 --> 20:41.492
you're going to die.

20:54.526 --> 20:57.192
(gasping)

20:57.226 --> 20:59.659
This batch just
came in from Miami.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.426
After you do
your thing,

21:01.459 --> 21:02.692
we're gonna be able
to charge double.

21:13.826 --> 21:16.326
Ut excelso excelsior.

21:16.359 --> 21:18.726
Ut fortis fortior.

21:21.159 --> 21:22.559
It's done.

21:27.892 --> 21:29.459
(whoops)

21:29.492 --> 21:31.159
(sniffs)

21:31.192 --> 21:34.126
(laughs)

21:34.159 --> 21:36.626
Did I say double?

21:36.659 --> 21:39.592
We're gonna charge triple
for this shit, baby.

21:39.626 --> 21:43.292
I don't want to use
my gifts like this anymore.

21:46.526 --> 21:50.192
Using your gifts
was your idea, remember?

21:50.226 --> 21:52.459
I know, and it was fun
for a while.

21:52.492 --> 21:54.926
But now it just feels
cheap and seedy.

21:54.959 --> 21:56.926
(laughing):
Oh, baby!

21:56.959 --> 21:58.659
None of this is cheap!

21:58.692 --> 22:00.359
I don't care about the money!

22:00.392 --> 22:03.692
This isn't the life
I want to live.

22:03.726 --> 22:07.659
It's that bartender you used
to work with, isn't it?

22:07.692 --> 22:10.859
What's his name? Bobby?

22:10.892 --> 22:12.826
Talk about cheap and seedy.

22:12.859 --> 22:14.692
This has nothing to do with him.

22:14.726 --> 22:17.259
You lying bitch!

22:17.292 --> 22:19.159
I know what you're
doing with him!

22:19.192 --> 22:21.992
I know what you do
with him‐‐ I saw you!

22:22.026 --> 22:24.259
Come on, baby, aren't you gonna
fight back? Gonna fight back?

22:24.292 --> 22:25.992
I'm done.
I'm leaving.

22:26.026 --> 22:27.692
Get your ass over here, now!
Come here!

22:27.726 --> 22:29.859
(yells)

22:31.226 --> 22:33.659
You think you can
get away from me?!

22:33.692 --> 22:35.092
This isn't over!

22:35.126 --> 22:36.126
I'll find you!

22:36.159 --> 22:37.792
You're dead!

22:37.826 --> 22:40.292
You hear me?! You're dead!

22:48.492 --> 22:50.959
Dash, the longer you wait,
the worse it's gonna get.

22:50.992 --> 22:52.359
No. I don't understand.

22:52.392 --> 22:54.426
Ingrid, look,
death isn't a thing.

22:54.459 --> 22:56.092
You know, it‐it's
a biological process.

22:56.126 --> 22:58.092
This isn't about biology.

22:58.126 --> 23:01.292
There is a natural cosmic
balance in the universe.

23:01.326 --> 23:02.659
Nothing ever
disappears completely.

23:02.692 --> 23:04.026
And nothing goes to waste.

23:04.059 --> 23:05.592
It's like what happened

23:05.626 --> 23:06.992
with you and Killian.

23:07.026 --> 23:09.626
A transfer of energy.
Yeah, I know.

23:09.659 --> 23:12.259
There's a lot we can do, Dash.

23:12.292 --> 23:14.192
We have incredible power.

23:14.226 --> 23:16.326
But when it comes
to life and death,

23:16.359 --> 23:18.259
there's always a price.

23:18.292 --> 23:22.126
When I first found
out I was a witch,

23:22.159 --> 23:25.626
I brought my Aunt Wendy
back from the dead.

23:25.659 --> 23:27.792
It was impulsive.

23:27.826 --> 23:30.792
And I did it for all the
right reasons just like you.

23:30.826 --> 23:33.659
But what I didn't know
was that by doing it,

23:33.692 --> 23:36.426
someone I loved had to die.

23:36.459 --> 23:37.526
And they did.

23:37.559 --> 23:40.192
Balance has to be restored.

23:40.226 --> 23:42.326
And what am I supposed to do?

23:42.359 --> 23:44.692
Just kill a 13‐year‐old kid?

23:44.726 --> 23:46.692
No, not kill him.

23:46.726 --> 23:49.226
Return his death to him.

23:51.659 --> 23:53.192
"Munere Mortis."

23:53.226 --> 23:56.592
"The Gift of Death."

23:56.626 --> 23:58.626
You have to put Sam's death

23:58.659 --> 24:01.526
back into Sam's body.

24:01.559 --> 24:04.826
As horrible as that sounds,
it was his time to die.

24:04.859 --> 24:07.292
Not yours.

24:11.326 --> 24:14.526
Once the Mandragora activates
the veneno linea,

24:14.559 --> 24:16.492
the bowl will shatter.

24:16.526 --> 24:17.626
And then?

24:17.659 --> 24:19.126
He'll leave a trail.

24:19.159 --> 24:21.826
And we can trace his steps
back to his home.

24:21.859 --> 24:23.292
So, that's it?

24:23.326 --> 24:24.792
We just stand here until then,

24:24.826 --> 24:26.692
staring at the bowl?
Mm‐hmm.

24:26.726 --> 24:29.992
Come get me when something
actually happens.

24:30.026 --> 24:32.159
(grunts)

24:32.192 --> 24:33.959
There's a new man in your life.

24:33.992 --> 24:35.592
What are you‐‐
some kind of seer?

24:35.626 --> 24:37.992
I run one of the most successful

24:38.026 --> 24:39.292
hedge funds in the world.

24:39.326 --> 24:40.992
I didn't end up there
accidentally.

24:41.026 --> 24:43.092
Yes.

24:43.126 --> 24:44.759
I'm "some kind of seer."

24:44.792 --> 24:46.192
Oh, cool.

24:46.226 --> 24:47.259
I read tarot.

24:47.292 --> 24:49.026
Cute. Tarot.

24:49.059 --> 24:51.459
It's like a kid's game.

24:51.492 --> 24:53.692
So, what happened between
you and my sister?

24:53.726 --> 24:55.192
Why do you hate her so much?

24:55.226 --> 24:56.692
She didn't tell you?

24:56.726 --> 24:57.626
No.

24:57.659 --> 24:59.126
Why am I not surprised?

24:59.159 --> 25:03.092
This man in your life,

25:03.126 --> 25:04.259
he wears a uniform.

25:04.292 --> 25:06.092
Mm‐hmm. Yes, he does.

25:06.126 --> 25:07.759
Mmm.

25:07.792 --> 25:08.792
He brings out your fire.

25:08.826 --> 25:10.459
Uh‐huh.

25:10.492 --> 25:13.026
But you're keeping him
at arm's length.

25:13.059 --> 25:15.459
You're scared.
No, I'm not.

25:15.492 --> 25:17.126
No, it's‐it's okay.
It makes sense.

25:17.159 --> 25:19.592
You've been hurt... a lot.

25:19.626 --> 25:21.426
Do you want to know

25:21.459 --> 25:23.126
how this turns out?
No, she doesn't.

25:23.159 --> 25:25.459
Yes, I do!
I can see your future, Wendy.

25:25.492 --> 25:28.426
Very clearly.
JOANNA: I just told you.

25:28.459 --> 25:30.192
Wendy doesn't want
to know her future.

25:30.226 --> 25:33.859
Don't speak for me.
I want to know.

25:33.892 --> 25:35.659
Whoa!
I'm heading to the woods.

25:35.692 --> 25:36.659
What is that?

25:36.692 --> 25:38.126
This dart contains a poison

25:38.159 --> 25:39.459
called discidium.

25:39.492 --> 25:41.426
Enough to kill
even a Mandragora.

25:41.459 --> 25:43.359
I'm coming with you.
I am, too.

25:43.392 --> 25:45.326
No, I need you to stay
here with Frederick.

25:45.359 --> 25:47.592
Neither one of you are coming.
We've already discussed this.

25:47.626 --> 25:49.526
You're staying here.
It's way too dangerous.

25:49.559 --> 25:51.992
He's after my son!

25:52.026 --> 25:54.659
Come on, Alex, I'm not gonna
let you fight him alone.

25:54.692 --> 25:56.259
That's what makes it dangerous.

25:56.292 --> 25:58.826
Why are you always
so damn stubborn?

25:58.859 --> 26:02.226
Says the stubbornest
woman I've ever met.

26:04.392 --> 26:06.792
(monitor beeping steadily)

26:12.692 --> 26:13.992
Dr. Gardiner?

26:14.026 --> 26:16.292
Hey.

26:16.326 --> 26:19.359
He's looking good, isn't he?

26:19.392 --> 26:21.026
Yes.

26:21.059 --> 26:22.626
Yeah, he is.

26:22.659 --> 26:24.759
Dr. Benson told me
what you did.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.992
How you saved Sammy after
everyone else had given up.

26:31.326 --> 26:33.759
I don't know
how to thank you.

26:33.792 --> 26:35.626
The thought of living
without him, it's just...

26:35.659 --> 26:38.026
There‐there were
a lot of other factors.

26:38.059 --> 26:39.959
I can't take all the credit.

26:39.992 --> 26:41.292
Well, whatever you did,

26:41.326 --> 26:42.959
it was a miracle.

26:42.992 --> 26:44.926
What do you mean?

26:44.959 --> 26:46.792
He's in total remission.

26:46.826 --> 26:48.926
He is?

26:48.959 --> 26:50.492
The test results
came back clean

26:50.526 --> 26:52.326
for the first time

26:52.359 --> 26:54.526
in three years.

26:54.559 --> 26:56.192
There's no sign of the cancer

26:56.226 --> 26:59.126
anywhere in his body.

26:59.159 --> 27:02.492
Well, that's the best
news I've heard all day.

27:02.526 --> 27:04.959
If‐if you'll excuse me,
Mrs. Jacobs.

27:04.992 --> 27:06.826
Of course, of course.

27:27.016 --> 27:28.916
(indistinct radio transmission)

27:30.534 --> 27:32.667
Move, move! Out of the way!

27:32.701 --> 27:34.101
What happened?

27:34.134 --> 27:37.267
Male, 34, gunshot wound
to the upper torso.

27:37.301 --> 27:38.601
He tried to rob a liquor store.

27:38.634 --> 27:41.101
Killed the owner,
took a shot at the cops.

27:41.134 --> 27:43.034
They took him down.
This freakin' hurts!

27:43.067 --> 27:45.501
Yeah, well, lucky for you the
bullet went through and through.

27:45.534 --> 27:46.934
Looks like he's gonna make it?

27:46.967 --> 27:48.234
Yeah.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.567
Seems like the wrong ones
always survive.

28:04.767 --> 28:07.234
(gasps)

28:23.601 --> 28:26.334
Okay. After he crossed
the veneno linea,

28:26.367 --> 28:28.234
he headed this way.

28:28.267 --> 28:31.834
And if we do end up
fighting him, just,

28:31.867 --> 28:34.534
whatever you do, stay
away from his tentacles.

28:34.567 --> 28:35.601
Why?

28:35.634 --> 28:37.834
When a Mandragora attacks,

28:37.867 --> 28:40.834
it uses its tentacles
to inject a neurotoxin

28:40.867 --> 28:42.167
into the brain of its victim.

28:42.201 --> 28:43.667
It's not only very painful,

28:43.701 --> 28:46.434
it results in psychosis,
and eventually death.

28:46.467 --> 28:49.034
Yeah, that sounds like something

28:49.067 --> 28:50.434
we should try to avoid.

28:50.467 --> 28:52.001
Oh, yeah.

28:52.034 --> 28:54.267
I got your back.

28:59.134 --> 29:01.667
(knocking)
Freya!

29:01.701 --> 29:04.367
You didn't tell me you were
coming in from the city!

29:04.401 --> 29:06.401
I would've cooked.
I wanted to surprise you.

29:06.434 --> 29:08.267
I've missed you, Mom.
Aw!

29:08.301 --> 29:09.267
You look so good.

29:09.301 --> 29:10.501
Thanks.

29:10.534 --> 29:11.901
You look awful.

29:11.934 --> 29:13.234
Are you okay?

29:13.267 --> 29:14.734
Yeah. Yeah. I'm getting there.

29:14.767 --> 29:15.934
Oh.

29:15.967 --> 29:17.601
Wow, I didn't know
you had company.

29:17.634 --> 29:20.234
Oh, honey, this is my friend.

29:20.267 --> 29:22.234
Alex.

29:22.267 --> 29:23.934
Freya, ooh!

29:23.967 --> 29:25.667
I've heard so
much about you.

29:25.701 --> 29:26.901
We were about to make fondue.

29:26.934 --> 29:29.201
Please, join us.
Yeah.

29:31.134 --> 29:33.434
So, come on.

29:33.467 --> 29:35.901
So, tell me.

29:35.934 --> 29:38.167
What's going on?

29:38.201 --> 29:40.134
I just ditched Dan.

29:41.134 --> 29:44.267
I am so proud of you, baby.

29:44.301 --> 29:46.201
Finally.
But I met someone else, Mom.

29:47.301 --> 29:48.534
I'm in love.

29:48.567 --> 29:50.034
For real this time.

29:50.067 --> 29:51.567
And we're moving to California.

29:51.601 --> 29:54.734
What?! Why, why so far away?!

29:54.767 --> 29:56.167
We want to be near the beach.

29:56.201 --> 29:57.567
There are beaches literally

29:57.601 --> 29:59.501
two blocks from here.

29:59.534 --> 30:02.601
I need to be as far away
from Dan as possible.

30:02.634 --> 30:05.434
But you can come visit
whenever you want.

30:05.467 --> 30:08.434
Maybe even play with grandkids.

30:08.467 --> 30:10.501
Wait, are you...?
No.

30:10.534 --> 30:14.167
No. No, no, no.
But I'm hoping, maybe,

30:14.201 --> 30:15.501
someday soon.

30:15.534 --> 30:16.934
Well, this calls

30:16.967 --> 30:19.734
for some champagne

30:19.767 --> 30:21.334
for a proper toast.

30:21.367 --> 30:22.734
(chuckles)

30:22.767 --> 30:24.201
Hmm.

30:24.234 --> 30:27.034
This man
you love,

30:27.067 --> 30:30.001
ooh, he's been waiting
for you for a long time.

30:30.034 --> 30:33.001
He'd walk through fire for you.

30:33.034 --> 30:34.734
Oh. I want to know everything.

30:34.767 --> 30:36.934
Tell me it all.
Where are we getting married?

30:36.967 --> 30:38.701
How many babies
are we gonna have?

30:38.734 --> 30:40.567
(sighs)

30:40.601 --> 30:42.234
What's wrong?

30:42.267 --> 30:45.734
This man you're about to marry,

30:45.767 --> 30:47.667
you've known him before.

30:47.701 --> 30:50.234
By many names,
over many lives.

30:50.267 --> 30:51.901
I have?

30:51.934 --> 30:54.401
It doesn't end well.

30:54.434 --> 30:56.834
It never has.

30:56.867 --> 30:59.067
The two of you are star‐crossed.

30:59.101 --> 31:00.901
I'm sorry.

31:00.934 --> 31:02.667
Wait, what does that mean?

31:02.701 --> 31:05.001
As long as the stars
are in opposition,

31:05.034 --> 31:07.334
it doesn't matter how much
in love you are with each other.

31:07.367 --> 31:09.534
You have
to let him go. Now.

31:09.567 --> 31:11.501
Break this cycle
of pain

31:11.534 --> 31:13.567
and death before it's too late.

31:13.601 --> 31:15.034
You're wrong.

31:15.067 --> 31:17.534
I wish I was.

31:17.567 --> 31:19.201
I have visions, too.

31:19.234 --> 31:20.834
I have the gift
of premonition,

31:20.867 --> 31:23.334
and I've never seen
anything bad happen to us.

31:23.367 --> 31:26.734
Well, maybe the drugs
are clouding your vision.

31:27.767 --> 31:29.901
Tell my mom I had to go.

31:31.234 --> 31:32.767
(sighs)

31:36.301 --> 31:38.301
Where's Freya?

31:59.467 --> 32:00.834
(whispering):
No.

32:00.867 --> 32:02.867
(gasps)
Not again.

32:02.901 --> 32:06.201
What the hell
is happening to me?

32:08.567 --> 32:10.567
(machines beeping)

32:18.601 --> 32:20.401
It's about time, man.

32:20.434 --> 32:23.767
I‐I need something for the pain.

32:25.367 --> 32:27.767
Asshole, I said
I'm in pain.

32:29.467 --> 32:31.467
Let me take care
of that for you.

32:35.701 --> 32:37.767
Munere Mortis.

32:37.801 --> 32:39.701
Wait, what are you...
what are you saying?

32:39.734 --> 32:41.734
Munere Mortis.

32:41.767 --> 32:45.167
W‐What the hell
are you doing, man?

32:45.201 --> 32:48.201
Munere Mortis.
I said I'm in pain.

32:54.767 --> 32:56.834
Hey!

32:56.867 --> 32:58.367
Hey, hey, where are
you going...? (groans)

32:58.401 --> 33:00.367
(beeping increases)

33:00.401 --> 33:01.401
He's not breathing.

33:10.234 --> 33:12.234
(knocking)

33:18.634 --> 33:19.801
Hey.

33:21.934 --> 33:24.534
Dash, thank God you're alive.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.567
Did you do it?

33:28.301 --> 33:30.767
Yes. Yeah.

33:30.801 --> 33:33.667
Look, I know how hard
that must've been.

33:33.701 --> 33:35.767
It is heartbreaking
and tragic,

33:35.801 --> 33:37.534
and I wish there was
some other answer,

33:37.567 --> 33:40.201
but once someone's gone,
you can't mess with that.

33:40.234 --> 33:42.201
You did the right thing.

33:42.234 --> 33:44.067
Yeah.

33:44.101 --> 33:46.067
Uh, Ingrid,

33:46.101 --> 33:48.101
I got your test results back.

33:48.134 --> 33:50.234
Look, everything checked out;
there's no red flags.

33:50.267 --> 33:52.267
There's nothing
physically wrong with you.

33:52.301 --> 33:53.767
You're fine.

33:53.801 --> 33:55.167
What's wrong?

33:55.201 --> 33:56.534
I'm not fine, Dash.

33:56.567 --> 33:58.767
I know I'm not fine.

33:58.801 --> 34:00.067
I can run some more tests.

34:00.101 --> 34:01.201
I don't want any more tests.

34:01.234 --> 34:02.767
Something is happening to me

34:02.801 --> 34:04.234
when I sleepwalk.

34:04.267 --> 34:06.834
Dash, I want you
to do something for me.

34:06.867 --> 34:08.834
What?

34:08.867 --> 34:12.267
I want you to watch me sleep.

34:31.467 --> 34:33.667
(groaning)

34:33.701 --> 34:34.901
Frederick!

34:34.934 --> 34:37.601
Curavi

34:37.634 --> 34:40.034
conrepito.

34:42.401 --> 34:44.734
(gasping)

34:48.601 --> 34:50.401
What happened?

34:50.434 --> 34:52.567
You were having a seizure.

34:53.767 --> 34:55.401
Oh.

34:55.434 --> 34:57.501
"Oh"? That's all you got for me?

34:57.534 --> 34:58.901
Has this happened before?

34:58.934 --> 35:00.534
Ever since I came
through the portal,

35:00.567 --> 35:01.767
it's been happening
periodically.

35:01.801 --> 35:03.167
I don't know why.

35:03.201 --> 35:05.034
Okay, we need to tell
your mother about this.

35:05.067 --> 35:06.201
No, not now!

35:06.234 --> 35:07.667
She has enough on her plate.

35:07.701 --> 35:09.701
(grunts)

35:09.734 --> 35:12.734
I know that you have
a lot of doubts about me,

35:12.767 --> 35:15.101
and I don't blame you.

35:15.134 --> 35:16.501
I have to earn your trust.

35:16.534 --> 35:18.534
But I don't want to worry her.

35:18.567 --> 35:19.867
But maybe she can stop
the seizures.

35:19.901 --> 35:20.901
No, wait, please.

35:20.934 --> 35:22.434
Just...

35:22.467 --> 35:23.901
promise me you won't
say anything

35:23.934 --> 35:25.634
until after they kill
the Mandragora.

35:28.567 --> 35:30.167
ALEX:
Look for an opening.

35:30.201 --> 35:32.601
Like a‐a cave.
Okay, got it.

35:32.634 --> 35:35.201
So, why were you so adamant

35:35.234 --> 35:37.567
about me not giving
Wendy a reading?

35:37.601 --> 35:39.401
(scoffs) Because I
believe it's dangerous

35:39.434 --> 35:41.534
to know too much
about your future.

35:41.567 --> 35:44.867
Besides, it didn't
exactly work out so well

35:44.901 --> 35:46.901
when you read Freya.

35:46.934 --> 35:49.034
Is that why you shut me out?

35:50.367 --> 35:52.367
Alex, I'm so sorry.

35:52.401 --> 35:54.867
I just, I...

35:54.901 --> 35:56.401
I guess I got scared.

35:56.434 --> 35:59.201
I‐I couldn't handle it.
You're so intense.

35:59.234 --> 36:02.234
(chuckles) That's what I thought
you liked about me.

36:03.734 --> 36:05.434
Alex.

36:20.634 --> 36:23.534
Passion was never an issue
with us, was it?

36:50.034 --> 36:52.534
(rustling)

37:22.434 --> 37:24.867
Alex?

37:28.134 --> 37:29.001
No!

37:29.034 --> 37:30.067
(gunshot)

37:30.101 --> 37:31.334
(screams)

37:31.367 --> 37:33.167
(gasping)

37:33.201 --> 37:34.401
What happened?

37:34.434 --> 37:35.634
I have no idea.

37:37.801 --> 37:40.501
What the hell
is wrong with you?!

37:40.534 --> 37:41.901
I had him; he should be dead

37:41.934 --> 37:43.234
right now.
It's Ingrid!

37:43.267 --> 37:44.867
If he dies, so does Ingrid.

37:44.901 --> 37:46.101
She's his mate.

37:58.452 --> 38:01.519
(panting)

38:01.552 --> 38:03.552
(disco music playing)

38:31.910 --> 38:33.843
Let's get the hell out of here.

38:41.110 --> 38:42.477
(screams, gunshots)

38:42.510 --> 38:43.943
(crowd screaming)

38:45.843 --> 38:47.143
Oh, my God!

38:47.177 --> 38:48.910
This is your fault!

38:48.943 --> 38:51.843
That's what you get.

38:58.710 --> 39:00.710
(gasps)

39:03.610 --> 39:05.677
Oh, my God.

39:05.710 --> 39:08.643
So you've never seen

39:08.677 --> 39:10.210
anything like this
happen before?

39:10.243 --> 39:11.810
Ever?

39:11.843 --> 39:13.377
No.

39:13.410 --> 39:17.310
And I've seen a lot.

39:17.343 --> 39:20.477
Look, Ingrid, I think
this might be a situation

39:20.510 --> 39:22.477
where we should consult
your family.

39:22.510 --> 39:24.043
You know, in fact,
I'm surprised

39:24.077 --> 39:25.743
you haven't talked to them
about this already.

39:25.777 --> 39:27.743
Why is that?

39:29.843 --> 39:31.343
Ingrid?

39:32.577 --> 39:34.310
Ingrid, is everything okay?

39:34.343 --> 39:37.343
(bellowing)
Ingrid!
Ingrid!

39:39.577 --> 39:40.777
Stop.

39:43.243 --> 39:45.110
Stop! Settle down!

39:47.243 --> 39:48.377
Ingrid...

39:48.410 --> 39:50.110
(screaming)

39:57.843 --> 39:58.910
KILLIAN:
Hey.

39:58.943 --> 40:00.143
You're still here?

40:00.177 --> 40:02.243
I thought you left hours ago.

40:06.010 --> 40:07.143
Are you okay?

40:07.177 --> 40:09.410
Actually, I'm great.

40:09.443 --> 40:11.210
I mean, I've had

40:11.243 --> 40:13.210
a hell of a day, but I'm...

40:13.243 --> 40:14.877
I have learned a few things.

40:16.677 --> 40:18.877
Just because you want something,

40:18.910 --> 40:21.177
and it feels really good,

40:21.210 --> 40:24.177
doesn't mean it's good for you.

40:24.210 --> 40:26.510
So, I...

40:26.543 --> 40:28.810
just want to say, despite all

40:28.843 --> 40:31.343
of our history, that
I'm glad you're safe.

40:31.377 --> 40:35.210
And you're happy with Eva.

40:37.010 --> 40:38.810
I think you guys
are meant to be.

40:38.843 --> 40:40.410
Thanks.

40:40.443 --> 40:42.577
So do I.

40:42.610 --> 40:44.310
So, we good?

40:44.343 --> 40:46.043
Of course.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.543
Always.

40:47.577 --> 40:48.643
(chuckles)
Hi.

40:48.677 --> 40:50.310
Hey.
Mi amor.

40:50.343 --> 40:52.343
Long day.

40:52.377 --> 40:54.410
Thought you could use a drink.

40:54.443 --> 40:55.977
Thank you.

40:56.010 --> 40:57.810
I'll see you guys later.

40:57.843 --> 40:59.343
Mmm.

40:59.377 --> 41:01.310
That is delicious.

41:01.343 --> 41:02.643
Thank you.

41:02.677 --> 41:03.810
I'm glad you like it.

41:03.843 --> 41:05.410
Drink up.

41:22.177 --> 41:23.877
Dash!

41:23.910 --> 41:26.743
Ingrid!

41:35.210 --> 41:37.143
Are you sure she's here?

41:37.177 --> 41:38.477
This is where
the tracks led us.

41:38.510 --> 41:40.110
It's the best chance
we've got.

41:42.877 --> 41:44.177
JOANNA:
Ingrid, stop!

41:44.210 --> 41:46.510
Don't go with him!

41:46.543 --> 41:48.510
Ingrid. Ingrid.
No. No!

41:48.543 --> 41:50.110
