02:29.656 --> 02:32.121
Hello?

02:32.154 --> 02:34.651
Is somebody there?

02:34.714 --> 02:37.595
Who is this?

02:37.818 --> 02:40.219
- Cut! Cut!
- Did I do something wrong?

02:40.282 --> 02:42.355
No, you were fine. Zeke, what
are you doing back there?

02:42.395 --> 02:44.092
Sorry, I didn't know
I was in the shot.

02:44.154 --> 02:45.722
Detroit?

02:45.786 --> 02:47.326
Yeah, go ahead.

02:47.388 --> 02:49.116
Tell Harry there's somebody
in the lobby to see him.

02:49.179 --> 02:51.644
All right, I'm on it.

02:52.669 --> 02:56.802
Yeah, I think that eye shadow
looked really really great.

02:56.862 --> 02:59.103
Hey, Harry? Sorry.

02:59.165 --> 03:00.831
You have a visitor
down in the lobby.

03:00.892 --> 03:03.775
Yeah, right, I'll be right down.

03:29.088 --> 03:32.002
We will be watching you.

03:32.577 --> 03:34.179
It's pretty twisted, isn't it?

03:34.241 --> 03:35.905
Especially for this place.

03:35.968 --> 03:38.596
So how's my favorite writer doing?

03:38.658 --> 03:41.987
- Still can't believe this is happening.
- I know. Well, believe it.

03:42.049 --> 03:44.836
Come on, I'll give
you a quick tour.

03:52.451 --> 03:55.493
This building's
almost 100 years old.

03:55.555 --> 03:58.311
It was the state's first
psychiatric teaching hospital.

03:58.371 --> 04:00.292
Shut its doors about six years ago.

04:00.355 --> 04:02.726
Only six years? Looks more like 20.

04:02.789 --> 04:05.927
Yeah, when they shut the place down,
they forgot to blow out the pipes.

04:05.989 --> 04:10.374
The first freeze, all the plumbing burst.
There was water everywhere.

04:10.439 --> 04:14.056
We're the first ones in here since
they let all the loonies out.

04:30.408 --> 04:33.927
Hey, Mitch, do you read me?

04:33.961 --> 04:36.201
Mitch, where the
hell are those PAs?

04:36.264 --> 04:38.187
We're 15 minutes away
from wrapping this shot.

04:38.251 --> 04:41.227
That basement needs to be ready.

04:43.082 --> 04:45.962
- Watch the ball.
- Shut up, shut up!

04:53.321 --> 04:55.212
Jurgen, come on, man.

04:55.274 --> 04:56.875
- She's really fast, man.
- All right.

04:56.938 --> 04:59.341
And you're 6'3". Next time,
stuff her ass, dude.

04:59.405 --> 05:01.774
Listen, it is not
polite to stuff a lady.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.308
- Don't make excuses, okay?
- Okay?

05:03.371 --> 05:05.037
- Play like a winner.
- Okay, guys.

05:05.100 --> 05:07.310
That's game. I win.

05:08.845 --> 05:10.800
What the fuck are you guys doing?

05:10.862 --> 05:13.423
What? We're on 15.

05:13.485 --> 05:15.983
Did you not hear my radio?
The break is over.

05:16.045 --> 05:18.126
Get back to work.

05:18.189 --> 05:20.944
Beth, I need some light stands.
The rest of you, downstairs.

05:23.086 --> 05:24.719
Gimme that call sheet.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.393
Whoa! Hey, baby, next time you're
gonna reach your hand in my pocket,

05:27.406 --> 05:30.513
- why don't you let me know?
- Yeah, all right, Darrell.

05:30.575 --> 05:32.400
By the way, your boyfriend
is a total douche.

05:32.462 --> 05:34.961
Oh, no no no no! Ex-boyfriend.

05:35.023 --> 05:36.753
I don't believe it.

05:36.817 --> 05:38.641
You guys are totally
still doing it.

05:38.704 --> 05:42.355
Oh my God! No, long
and over, my friend.

05:42.416 --> 05:44.946
Or should I say short and over?

05:45.008 --> 05:46.482
Oh, nice.

05:46.545 --> 05:48.274
All right, I'll see you guys later.

05:48.337 --> 05:49.618
Yeah.

05:49.681 --> 05:51.827
So this is the pool.

05:54.259 --> 05:56.499
What kind of pool is this?

05:56.561 --> 06:00.951
This is where the doctor performed some
of his more controversial therapies.

06:01.010 --> 06:03.347
This pool has a bit of a history.

06:03.411 --> 06:06.647
So, um...

06:06.707 --> 06:09.335
we decided to change
your ending a bit.

06:09.398 --> 06:12.501
We're gonna have the nurse and the
detective confront the killer in here.

06:12.563 --> 06:14.583
Oh.

06:14.645 --> 06:17.944
Um, yeah. That could work.

06:18.005 --> 06:19.381
Good.

06:19.444 --> 06:21.622
Come on, I'll show
you the main set.

06:26.101 --> 06:28.568
Oh! What's that smell?

06:28.631 --> 06:31.641
Ugh. They don't call it the bowels
of a building for nothing, huh?

08:28.035 --> 08:31.175
All right, here we go. This
is sort of our holding area.

08:31.238 --> 08:33.798
And here it is...
our apartment set.

08:33.860 --> 08:36.390
This is, uh, Detroit.

08:36.452 --> 08:38.373
- Nice to meet you. Chris.
- Nice to meet you.

08:38.437 --> 08:40.006
Nice to meet you.

08:40.070 --> 08:42.344
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, hi.

08:44.518 --> 08:47.530
- This looks great.
- Yeah, not bad, huh?

08:47.592 --> 08:49.288
Does this stuff work?

08:49.351 --> 08:52.170
Uh, it's all real, but
none of it's operational.

08:52.231 --> 08:54.568
Whatever you do, don't use the
toilet in here. It's not hooked up.

08:54.631 --> 08:56.972
- Gotcha.
- But it looks pretty good, huh?

08:57.033 --> 08:58.891
We did it under budget.
We did it on the cheap.

08:58.953 --> 09:00.393
Looks better than my place.

09:00.455 --> 09:02.153
This is where she kills him, right?

09:02.216 --> 09:03.787
- Yeah, you bet it is.
- Nice.

09:03.850 --> 09:05.162
- Yeah.
- Everybody stand by.

09:07.049 --> 09:10.220
The actors' dressing
rooms are up here.

09:14.824 --> 09:16.427
Sorry to interrupt.

09:16.490 --> 09:18.893
Just wanted to introduce
our writer Chris.

09:18.955 --> 09:22.766
Hey. Great damn script,
man. Fucking genius.

09:22.828 --> 09:25.260
I really love what you've written.

09:25.322 --> 09:26.733
Thanks.

09:28.331 --> 09:31.821
Uh, well, we'll let you get back
to what you were doing.

09:31.883 --> 09:33.485
Take it easy.

09:57.745 --> 09:59.377
What's with the boxing ring?

09:59.440 --> 10:01.361
Oh, another actor's demand.

10:01.424 --> 10:04.466
They're a bunch of prima donnas.
They wanted their own trailers.

10:04.527 --> 10:07.218
I told them we had a whole
hospital, they threatened to walk.

10:07.280 --> 10:09.330
I had to build them these
fancy dressing rooms.

10:09.393 --> 10:11.668
What are you gonna do, you know?

10:11.729 --> 10:13.521
- Ah.
- Oh, hey.

10:13.585 --> 10:16.146
This is Jess, our
production manager.

10:16.208 --> 10:18.899
And still photographer
and set dresser.

10:18.962 --> 10:21.043
Yeah yeah yeah yeah. I'm just
getting my money's worth.

10:21.104 --> 10:22.802
He's a pain in the ass.

10:22.866 --> 10:24.440
You can thank Jess for
finding this place.

10:24.467 --> 10:26.259
- This is Chris.
- Oh, the writer.

10:26.322 --> 10:27.730
Cool, nice to meet you.

10:27.795 --> 10:30.805
I really really like the script.

10:30.867 --> 10:32.788
Thanks.

10:32.853 --> 10:35.541
Yeah? What?

10:35.603 --> 10:37.300
Well, how much is
that going to cost?

10:37.364 --> 10:38.389
Wait...

10:38.452 --> 10:40.438
Hold on, you're
breaking up. Hold on.

10:40.500 --> 10:42.677
Guys, I gotta take this.
I'll be outside.

10:42.739 --> 10:44.213
What the hell happened?

10:44.278 --> 10:45.973
I left you 10 minutes ago.
What's going on?

10:46.035 --> 10:47.957
So are you ready for a long night?

10:48.022 --> 10:50.007
How late are you guys shooting?

10:50.069 --> 10:52.406
Uh, 5:30 A.M.

10:53.654 --> 10:55.607
It's just like pulling an
all-nighter in college.

10:55.669 --> 10:56.790
Well, that was a while ago.

10:56.854 --> 10:58.618
Cute dog.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.825
Yeah, he's the director's.

11:00.887 --> 11:02.167
His name's Rusty.

11:02.230 --> 11:04.665
- I get to babysit.
- Fun.

11:08.440 --> 11:10.072
Oh, hey. I didn't know
you were still here.

11:10.135 --> 11:12.505
Yeah, I'm just finishing up.

11:12.567 --> 11:15.611
- See you in the morning.
- Okay. Good night.

11:15.673 --> 11:17.689
Good night.

11:17.751 --> 11:20.955
That's Marissa. She's the editor.

11:21.018 --> 11:23.900
She actually cut together
some footage today.

11:23.961 --> 11:25.979
- You want to take a look?
- Yeah, sure.

11:26.041 --> 11:28.025
- Yeah?
- Okay.

11:36.410 --> 11:38.524
All right, there you go.

11:39.548 --> 11:41.919
Oh, that dog is making me mental.

11:41.980 --> 11:43.967
I'd better go check on him.

11:44.028 --> 11:46.204
Do you want anything
to drink or anything?

11:46.268 --> 11:47.868
- No, I'm fine.
- Okay.

11:47.930 --> 11:49.470
I'll be back in a minute.

11:53.052 --> 11:54.655
What took you so long?

11:54.717 --> 11:56.606
I was painting my nails.

11:58.780 --> 12:02.465
I had an accident, okay?
The fucking ceiling collapsed.

12:02.526 --> 12:04.096
Don't believe me, Mitch?

12:05.246 --> 12:07.904
Why don't you have a
look for yourself?

12:10.496 --> 12:11.936
So...

12:13.182 --> 12:14.691
what do we do now?

12:14.751 --> 12:17.761
Well, I was gonna take a shower.

12:18.976 --> 12:21.954
But I don't know about you.

12:22.018 --> 12:24.580
A shower sounds good to me.

12:24.641 --> 12:25.794
Is there...

12:26.785 --> 12:28.674
room for two?

12:28.739 --> 12:30.178
Hey.

12:30.241 --> 12:33.027
Uh, they're setting
up a shot downstairs.

12:33.088 --> 12:34.596
I can take you down there.

12:34.658 --> 12:36.387
Yeah.

12:42.371 --> 12:45.190
So here I'm supposed to
say, "Mono grammed."

12:45.252 --> 12:46.788
- I don't understand what that means.
- "Monogrammed."

12:46.851 --> 12:49.126
You're not supposed to say that.
That's a stage direction.

12:49.187 --> 12:50.629
Why are you asking me
about "monogrammed"?

12:50.692 --> 12:52.389
That's not even... this
part has been cut.

12:52.452 --> 12:55.015
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.
- It's okay.

12:55.076 --> 12:56.806
- Do you have any other questions?
- But how do you pronounce it?

12:56.867 --> 12:59.398
Don't worry about how you
pronounce it. You don't say it.

12:59.461 --> 13:00.999
Oh.

13:01.062 --> 13:02.827
So this is where we're
shooting the next scene,

13:02.885 --> 13:04.487
in these stacks over here.

13:04.548 --> 13:07.336
And it looks like they're
about ready to start.

13:07.396 --> 13:08.741
Am I gonna be in the way?

13:08.806 --> 13:12.073
Uh, no, you'll be fine.
Just stay there for a second.

13:12.134 --> 13:15.499
- Hey.
- Hey, Jess, how you doin'?

13:15.558 --> 13:17.352
Good good. I brought
the writer down.

13:18.791 --> 13:21.289
Oh, hey. So how's it going?

13:22.822 --> 13:26.058
I'm Chris. We met during the
table reading, remember?

13:26.120 --> 13:28.713
Oh, right.

13:46.986 --> 13:50.029
- Ah! Fuck!
- I'm sorry. Are you okay?

13:53.323 --> 13:56.494
- I'm sorry. I-I didn't see it.
- Chris, let's...

13:56.555 --> 13:58.766
"Is that how you want
the brains, director?

13:58.829 --> 14:00.300
That's how you want it?"
"That's how I want it.

14:00.363 --> 14:03.118
'Cause I want my motherfuckin'
brains on the wall."

14:03.180 --> 14:05.230
Okay, why don't you just
stay here for a minute?

14:05.292 --> 14:08.431
- I'll be back in a bit.
- That's what I'm talking about.

14:08.493 --> 14:11.182
Yeah. Very nice.

14:11.247 --> 14:15.827
Fucking brains on the wall
is my favorite thing to do.

14:22.446 --> 14:24.976
Sneak up on me.

14:27.023 --> 14:29.682
Oh ho ho! No way!

14:29.743 --> 14:32.978
Those brains are so fucking cool.

14:33.040 --> 14:35.569
Damn right, they're
so fucking cool.

14:35.631 --> 14:37.298
Ho!

14:48.690 --> 14:52.502
Will you excuse me for one second?

14:53.745 --> 14:54.929
Hey.

14:55.953 --> 14:57.203
Hey.

14:59.091 --> 15:00.659
Brian?

15:00.721 --> 15:01.972
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:02.037 --> 15:03.604
What are...

15:03.668 --> 15:06.488
please keep that fucking
mike away from that wall.

15:06.549 --> 15:08.694
Sorry, I... I heard
something back there.

15:08.757 --> 15:10.967
I don't care.

15:11.028 --> 15:13.110
We're filming in the hallway...

15:13.172 --> 15:14.933
- Yeah.
- ...not behind that wall.

15:14.995 --> 15:16.728
- Yeah.
- Good?

15:18.325 --> 15:19.510
Bye.

15:30.294 --> 15:33.049
Do we need some more black magic
marker, though, on the gun?

15:33.111 --> 15:34.186
No, no one's gonna see that.

15:34.231 --> 15:35.545
- Okay. Okay.
- It's way too far away.

15:35.608 --> 15:37.016
You're just going to walk down
from up here with Rachel.

15:37.078 --> 15:38.615
She has the flashlight.
You have the gun.

15:38.616 --> 15:40.313
Okay, let's get the
actors into place.

15:40.377 --> 15:42.330
- Okay, so just go over here.
- Yep.

15:45.401 --> 15:47.964
All right, last looks, everybody.

15:48.027 --> 15:50.684
Hold on.

15:50.745 --> 15:53.244
I'm picking up some footsteps.

15:53.306 --> 15:57.791
Can you have Detroit tell them
to stop moving around up there?

16:01.018 --> 16:02.430
Hey!

16:02.493 --> 16:04.381
We need you to stop moving.

16:04.444 --> 16:06.652
We weren't.

16:06.714 --> 16:08.478
Yeah.

16:10.843 --> 16:12.252
Douche.

16:14.844 --> 16:16.733
And action.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.328
Cut! Cut!

16:39.391 --> 16:42.049
What's your problem, Rachel?
Can't you walk in those shoes?

16:42.111 --> 16:44.547
Okay, let's try it again.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.669
Darrell, you've got
to check this out.

17:13.732 --> 17:15.846
Oh, dude, what is that?

17:15.906 --> 17:17.252
It's like a head shot!

17:18.819 --> 17:20.676
- Blah!
- Dude, I'm fucked!

17:21.891 --> 17:23.621
Oh, what do you think
they made it out of?

17:23.685 --> 17:26.631
I think he said it was a cinnamon-raisin
bagel or something like that.

17:26.693 --> 17:28.518
Really? I don't know, dude.

17:28.581 --> 17:31.304
The raisins are important because
it looks like brain matter.

17:31.365 --> 17:33.738
Mm. That was a doughnut.

17:36.486 --> 17:38.952
- Can I help?
- No, you shouldn't.

17:39.013 --> 17:42.664
- Union rules.
- I just feel kind of useless.

17:42.726 --> 17:45.098
You could steer clear
of those cables.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.240
Hey!

17:50.728 --> 17:52.393
You sure you don't need help?

17:52.455 --> 17:55.883
Yeah, no, it's really okay.

17:55.944 --> 17:57.801
I'm Chris, by the way.

17:57.863 --> 18:00.683
Oh, I know. You're the
screenwriter. Jess told me.

18:04.010 --> 18:06.827
- Nice to meet you.
- I'm Beth.

18:06.889 --> 18:09.165
So you wrote this thing, huh?

18:09.226 --> 18:11.435
Yeah. Please don't
say it's brilliant.

18:11.499 --> 18:13.967
- If one more person tells me that...
- I haven't read it.

18:14.026 --> 18:17.325
Sorry. I mean yet. I was
literally just brought on today

18:17.386 --> 18:19.468
as, like, a last-minute
replacement.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.646
I guess some girl got
sick or something.

18:21.707 --> 18:23.948
Beth, you're up. We need
you for a stand-in.

18:24.012 --> 18:26.797
Okay. Well, looks like I gotta go.

18:26.860 --> 18:29.391
But it was really nice to meet you.
I'm sure I'll see you around.

18:37.870 --> 18:40.656
Hey, sweetheart, can you
move a little to the left?

18:40.717 --> 18:42.798
Yeah, that's better.

18:42.861 --> 18:44.656
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:44.717 --> 18:48.048
So... he's pretty cute.

18:48.109 --> 18:50.226
- Who?
- The writer.

18:51.599 --> 18:53.266
Like you didn't notice.

18:53.327 --> 18:55.442
Okay.

18:55.505 --> 18:57.554
He's single.

18:57.615 --> 18:59.666
- Jess!
- I'm just saying.

19:01.169 --> 19:03.475
- I'll talk to you later.
- Okay, bye.

19:05.105 --> 19:06.802
Hey.

19:06.865 --> 19:08.722
Mr. Screenwriter, how are you?

19:08.785 --> 19:12.309
Whoa. Hey, man, you're
a little tight there.

19:12.369 --> 19:14.545
Just a... what?

19:14.609 --> 19:16.372
A guy can't give
another guy a massage?

19:16.434 --> 19:17.458
Well, hey...

19:17.522 --> 19:18.578
Don't worry about it.
Don't worry about it.

19:18.642 --> 19:21.014
I'm good at this.
I know what I'm doing.

19:21.075 --> 19:23.348
Hey, what do you think?

19:24.467 --> 19:26.774
You think those puppies are real?

19:26.836 --> 19:30.007
Man, I have some serious doubts.

19:31.251 --> 19:34.326
Well, there's only
one way to find out.

19:36.310 --> 19:37.909
Hey, no charge on that massage.

19:37.972 --> 19:40.599
Just make sure you got a part for
me in your next script, all right?

19:45.078 --> 19:47.223
- What's going on?
- Oh!

19:47.285 --> 19:50.138
God. What the fuck, dude?

19:53.943 --> 19:56.120
Oh, did you see that, dude?

19:56.183 --> 19:57.975
That guy just grabbed my balls.

19:58.039 --> 19:59.607
You should get those autographed.

19:59.671 --> 20:01.721
Whatever, dude.
That guy's a giant tool.

20:01.784 --> 20:04.890
I don't know, maybe he was just
trying to get into character.

20:04.950 --> 20:06.680
I heard he's method.

20:06.745 --> 20:09.978
I don't think his character is
an oversexed Hollywood actor.

20:10.039 --> 20:12.732
I don't know, but Harry said
he slept here last night...

20:12.793 --> 20:14.490
just trying to get the
vibe of the place.

20:14.552 --> 20:15.737
Weird.

20:15.801 --> 20:18.524
What's the "method"?

20:18.586 --> 20:20.509
Really?

20:21.722 --> 20:23.675
Let's get Rachel in place.

20:35.162 --> 20:36.411
Okay.

20:37.628 --> 20:39.550
Wait for us to call it down.

21:13.568 --> 21:15.521
Hey!

21:16.641 --> 21:18.819
Somebody open the doors.

21:46.051 --> 21:47.589
Open the doors!

21:49.027 --> 21:50.629
Please open the doors!

21:52.198 --> 21:53.127
Roll camera.

21:53.191 --> 21:55.335
- I'm rolling.
- Action.

22:04.583 --> 22:08.715
Cut. What, did she get off on
the wrong floor or something?

22:08.775 --> 22:10.919
Well, someone go find her.

22:10.982 --> 22:13.864
- I'll go.
- No no, send what's-her-face.

22:13.927 --> 22:17.418
We have to handle this one with
kid gloves. She's very fragile.

22:19.592 --> 22:21.512
Come on, let's go.

22:31.144 --> 22:34.059
This place is so disgusting.

22:48.331 --> 22:49.997
Rachel?

23:15.791 --> 23:17.776
- Rachel?
- Don't!

23:18.958 --> 23:21.039
- Are you okay?
- Someone was in there.

23:21.102 --> 23:22.417
In where?

23:22.479 --> 23:24.560
In the elevator.

23:24.623 --> 23:27.409
- I can't go back in there.
- Okay. Okay.

23:27.472 --> 23:30.355
I won't do it.

23:30.415 --> 23:32.530
Hey, Jess?

23:34.899 --> 23:38.004
Yeah, we'll just have to
figure something out.

23:38.064 --> 23:40.307
What the hell is going on?

23:40.369 --> 23:43.733
She is, like, pretty shaken up.

23:43.794 --> 23:46.132
Beth's taking her back
to her dressing room.

23:46.195 --> 23:48.693
And I think we should

23:48.754 --> 23:51.157
just give her a minute.

23:51.220 --> 23:53.334
All right, all right.

23:53.396 --> 23:56.213
I'll go talk to her.
What time is it?

23:56.275 --> 23:58.324
Uh, like 10:00.

23:58.388 --> 24:01.142
All right, it's as good a time
as any to break for lunch, okay?

24:01.203 --> 24:02.741
- All right.
- All right.

24:19.574 --> 24:22.425
Thanks. Do you have any water?

24:22.487 --> 24:25.050
Just the juice.

24:26.551 --> 24:28.985
This is the native food
of Denmark, by the way.

24:29.047 --> 24:30.329
- No, it's not.
- Frozen lasagna.

24:30.392 --> 24:33.146
Did you guys put corn in my coffee?

24:33.208 --> 24:35.355
- Ja, Jurgen. Zat was me.
- Oh, ja, ja.

24:35.416 --> 24:37.562
Zat's how zey drink
it in Copenhagen.

24:37.623 --> 24:39.609
- This seat taken?
- Oh, no, go ahead.

24:39.672 --> 24:40.986
Thanks.

24:42.073 --> 24:43.996
- What's up, man?
- Hey.

24:44.057 --> 24:46.716
- You with camera?
- No, I'm, uh...

24:46.778 --> 24:49.437
- He's the writer.
- No shit.

24:49.498 --> 24:51.953
You know we're just a bunch of
below-the-line grunts here, right?

24:51.961 --> 24:54.334
Yeah, the creatives
are at that table,

24:54.396 --> 24:55.899
over there.

24:55.962 --> 24:58.459
Hey, just ignore that.

24:58.523 --> 25:01.407
Oh, by the way, don't tell him
how much you like his script.

25:01.469 --> 25:03.293
He hates hearing that.

25:06.427 --> 25:09.440
Hey, did you guys check out that weird
filtration system in the basement?

25:09.502 --> 25:12.063
Jurgen thinks that's how they
administered the wacky juice.

25:12.124 --> 25:13.565
- In the water?
- Yeah.

25:13.629 --> 25:16.127
It's like they did with
fluoride in the '60s.

25:16.188 --> 25:19.039
The government just slipped
it into the water supply

25:19.103 --> 25:20.574
without anybody noticing.

25:20.638 --> 25:22.783
What do you know about that?
You're, like, 16

25:22.845 --> 25:25.792
- and from Denmark. Ja. Oh, ja.
- Ja, ja.

25:25.855 --> 25:28.511
Jurgen's like our
resident conspiracist.

25:28.573 --> 25:31.778
Hey, Jurgen, how'd you
get this job anyway?

25:31.839 --> 25:33.728
My dad's a friend of Harry's.

25:33.791 --> 25:35.104
They used to be business partners.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.735
Let me get this straight.

25:36.799 --> 25:39.266
You gave up your entire summer
break, flew over here from Denmark

25:39.327 --> 25:41.634
just to work on this low-budget
piece-of-shit movie?

25:41.696 --> 25:43.426
No offense, dude.

25:43.489 --> 25:46.370
Hell yeah, man. I love the movies.

25:46.433 --> 25:48.674
Oh.

25:49.986 --> 25:53.059
Dude, tell them about that snake
they found in the basement.

25:53.121 --> 25:56.036
Yeah, okay, so when they
were building this set,

25:56.098 --> 25:58.275
they found this snake
in the basement.

25:58.337 --> 26:01.284
Yeah, and it was all coiled up,
trying to swallow its own tail, man.

26:01.347 --> 26:02.948
How screwed up is that?

26:03.011 --> 26:05.701
Oh, you only wish that you
could do that, Darrell.

26:05.764 --> 26:07.044
Yeah, I do.

26:07.108 --> 26:08.516
- Yes, all day.
- That would be awesome.

26:08.578 --> 26:10.439
- Just...
- Sit there on my couch.

26:10.501 --> 26:12.101
- Ouroboros.
- What?

26:12.164 --> 26:14.693
Ouroboros... the snake
devouring its tail.

26:14.756 --> 26:17.350
It's an ancient symbol,
a Jungian archetype.

26:17.412 --> 26:20.424
It represents cyclicality...
the sense that something

26:20.486 --> 26:23.815
can constantly regenerate itself.

26:25.383 --> 26:28.361
Yeah, like I said, you might want
to sit at that table over there.

26:28.423 --> 26:30.568
Hey, don't be such a dick.

26:30.631 --> 26:32.424
Whatever, man.

26:32.486 --> 26:34.696
That basement creeps me out.

26:34.758 --> 26:37.225
Have you been down there,
dude? It's fucked up, man.

26:37.287 --> 26:39.561
So's this lasagna.

26:52.553 --> 26:55.498
She's not getting
back in the elevator.

26:55.561 --> 26:56.908
What are we gonna do?

26:56.970 --> 26:58.987
We can move back
into the apartment,

26:59.050 --> 27:01.163
pick up some of the shots
with Jack and Rachel.

27:01.226 --> 27:03.629
The DP's gonna need some
time to relight it, though.

27:03.690 --> 27:04.938
Okay.

27:05.001 --> 27:06.956
Andrei, what do you think?

27:07.946 --> 27:09.645
Andrei?

27:09.706 --> 27:12.718
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- All right, I'll go talk to her

27:12.779 --> 27:14.956
and see if I can't
whip her into shape.

27:18.956 --> 27:21.007
- Hey, can I talk to you?
- Yeah, what's up?

27:21.069 --> 27:23.663
It's the writer. I don't want him
getting in the way, you know?

27:23.725 --> 27:25.388
- Distracting the crew.
- Okay.

27:25.452 --> 27:27.791
He can watch the video feed.
I just don't want him on set.

27:27.853 --> 27:29.807
That's fine. I'll take care of it.

27:31.757 --> 27:34.959
- How's the hand?
- It's all right.

27:35.021 --> 27:37.265
Fucking playwright, whatever he is.

27:37.326 --> 27:39.535
Yeah.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.375
You okay?

27:43.438 --> 27:45.423
It's the air in this place.

27:45.486 --> 27:47.121
Yeah, it's probably the mold.

27:47.183 --> 27:49.456
It cannot be healthy
inhaling this shit.

27:50.639 --> 27:54.130
- Can I bum a smoke?
- Yeah.

27:55.248 --> 27:56.531
Hey, Jess?

27:56.594 --> 27:58.834
- I need you to do me a favor.
- Yeah?

27:58.897 --> 28:02.677
Babysit Chris for a while.
Andrei is acting funny.

28:02.738 --> 28:05.683
Besides, I need more photos anyway.
Go explore. Take him with you.

28:05.745 --> 28:06.770
- All right?
- Okay.

28:06.834 --> 28:08.402
All right. Thanks, babe.

28:31.701 --> 28:34.358
Yes. Okay, let's go.

28:34.419 --> 28:37.014
Yes, it's all under control.
Not an issue.

28:38.389 --> 28:40.918
Yes, I completely understand.
When can I start?

28:40.981 --> 28:43.832
Don't worry about anything.
Everything is completely under control.

28:43.894 --> 28:47.033
Yes. Don't worry about me.
Oh, okay.

28:47.096 --> 28:48.185
Oh, hey.

28:48.248 --> 28:50.392
I didn't know you were down here.

28:50.455 --> 28:53.562
What are you doing, following me?

28:53.624 --> 28:55.769
No. Sorry, I got lost.

28:55.831 --> 28:58.073
Who are you talking to?

29:07.705 --> 29:09.275
Chris?

29:09.337 --> 29:11.769
Beth and I are gonna take a
walk around the building,

29:11.832 --> 29:14.460
if you want to come...
just explore a little bit.

29:14.521 --> 29:16.410
- Sure.
- Okay.

29:23.675 --> 29:25.661
Wait. Hold up.

29:25.723 --> 29:28.478
Dude, check that out.

29:28.539 --> 29:32.799
- Oh, dude.
- Yeah, what! Whoa.

29:32.860 --> 29:34.526
Shit, dude.

29:34.588 --> 29:36.509
What is this?

29:37.531 --> 29:38.684
What is all this?

29:38.749 --> 29:40.703
- Whoa!
- Where are we?

29:40.766 --> 29:42.558
I don't know.

29:45.085 --> 29:47.713
How many people do
you think died here?

29:47.774 --> 29:49.440
I don't know. People
die everywhere.

29:49.503 --> 29:52.226
They don't just come to
the morgue and keel over.

29:52.286 --> 29:56.001
No, I mean how many people do you
think died in this hospital?

29:56.064 --> 29:57.888
A lot.

29:57.951 --> 30:01.122
Look at all this stuff.

30:01.182 --> 30:03.104
Hey, look at this thing.

30:03.166 --> 30:04.320
What is that?

30:04.383 --> 30:06.721
I think it's like an
ice-cream scooper,

30:06.785 --> 30:08.643
but for brains.

30:11.199 --> 30:13.002
Give me that, dude. I'm
gonna scoop your brains.

30:13.055 --> 30:15.171
I'm gonna scoop yours.
Blah blah blood!

30:16.387 --> 30:18.342
Hey hey hey.

30:18.402 --> 30:20.483
Check out that thing.

30:20.546 --> 30:23.013
What do you think that's for?

30:23.074 --> 30:25.476
They probably put something
in here, you know?

30:25.538 --> 30:27.235
What if that's where they
keep the bodies, man?

30:27.298 --> 30:29.734
Do you think there's
bodies in here?

30:29.796 --> 30:31.941
I don't know, dude. I hope so.

30:32.002 --> 30:35.238
- Open it up.
- No, I'm not gonna open it up!

30:35.299 --> 30:37.123
I'll give you 10 bucks.

30:38.723 --> 30:40.358
20.

30:40.421 --> 30:41.892
Deal.

30:41.955 --> 30:44.614
- Okay, ready?
- Yeah yeah yeah.

30:44.676 --> 30:46.662
- All right, three...
- Two...

30:46.724 --> 30:48.645
One.

30:49.798 --> 30:53.447
Oh ho ho! Nasty. Nasty.

30:53.509 --> 30:55.006
Look at that tunnel.
Where does that go?

30:55.012 --> 30:57.511
I don't know. Hello!

30:57.574 --> 30:59.177
Is there anybody alive down there?

30:59.239 --> 31:01.193
Is anybody alive in there?

31:04.840 --> 31:06.921
Dude, what the fuck was that, man?

31:06.984 --> 31:08.679
Did you... you heard that, right?

31:08.742 --> 31:10.215
Yeah, dude. Let's get
out of here, man.

31:10.279 --> 31:12.328
- Okay.
- This place is really creepy.

31:12.391 --> 31:13.864
Come on.

31:19.880 --> 31:21.834
I have to admit, you're
not what I expected.

31:21.896 --> 31:23.370
Oh? And what's that?

31:23.434 --> 31:26.349
I don't know. The writer type...

31:26.410 --> 31:29.614
dark, moody and complex.

31:29.673 --> 31:32.363
You're just so...

31:32.425 --> 31:33.641
Simple?

31:33.705 --> 31:35.339
I was gonna say "nice."

31:35.402 --> 31:38.926
Ah, the nice-guy curse. Yeah,
I've been trying to shake that.

31:38.986 --> 31:41.292
That's not what I meant.

31:47.469 --> 31:49.359
This must be the
water-filtration system

31:49.421 --> 31:51.342
that Jurgen was talking about.

31:51.405 --> 31:53.071
Do you think that's
true, what he said?

31:53.134 --> 31:55.279
That the doctor slipped
something into the water?

31:55.341 --> 31:56.847
I don't know.

31:56.910 --> 32:00.947
But I did find this casebook
upstairs in the library,

32:01.006 --> 32:03.183
and it had pictures of the doctor

32:03.246 --> 32:06.449
forcing the patients to drink
this vile-looking liquid.

32:07.471 --> 32:09.585
Pretty scary stuff.

32:13.487 --> 32:14.736
It's creepy.

32:14.798 --> 32:17.393
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah, let's go.

32:34.096 --> 32:36.563
What a mess.

32:38.641 --> 32:40.660
What do you think
these files are for?

32:40.723 --> 32:43.125
Old patient files, I think.

32:47.219 --> 32:49.782
- I love this.
- What?

32:49.844 --> 32:52.375
The doctors, they cover these
girls' eyes with black bars,

32:52.437 --> 32:55.511
but it hardly conceals
their identity.

32:55.573 --> 32:58.102
Plus all their information
is right here.

33:06.453 --> 33:09.881
- What's up?
- I thought someone was just...

33:11.702 --> 33:14.392
Is it Jess?

33:16.279 --> 33:18.522
Oh! Whoa, whoa!

33:20.440 --> 33:22.489
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. Are you okay?

33:22.552 --> 33:23.962
- Yeah.
- Oh, shit.

33:24.024 --> 33:25.495
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah.

33:25.558 --> 33:28.249
Somebody needs to fix the hole.

33:31.961 --> 33:33.627
What's the holdup now?

33:33.689 --> 33:35.451
The union says we need seven guys.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.499
- Seven guys? How many do we have?
- We've got five.

33:37.562 --> 33:39.033
Five? Well, where
are the other two?

33:39.097 --> 33:40.443
- They're coming.
- When?

33:40.506 --> 33:42.555
- I called them and...
- We need them here now.

33:42.618 --> 33:44.666
We only have an hour before...

33:44.731 --> 33:47.102
Oh, Jesus Christ, what's that?

33:47.162 --> 33:50.877
Shit. I got it.

35:09.891 --> 35:11.140
- Oh!
- You okay?

35:11.203 --> 35:14.183
- Yeah.
- Ha! Don't fall.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.359
Why was this place shut down?

35:21.349 --> 35:23.207
Funding, mostly.

35:24.518 --> 35:28.265
And the fact that the hospital
director killed himself

35:28.326 --> 35:31.240
after he...

35:31.302 --> 35:34.123
drowned his wife and kids
in the pool downstairs.

35:34.184 --> 35:35.498
Jeez.

35:35.560 --> 35:38.602
Apparently, he blew his
brains out in my office.

35:38.663 --> 35:40.394
Oh.

35:40.456 --> 35:41.705
That's comforting.

35:41.768 --> 35:43.275
This is it.

35:43.336 --> 35:45.546
This is the end of the line.

35:50.761 --> 35:54.092
What is this place? Some
sort of observation deck?

36:02.027 --> 36:03.660
I saw a bat in here the other day.

36:03.722 --> 36:07.086
I know. If anything comes
out, I am going to freak out.

36:07.147 --> 36:09.933
I really don't like
furry flying animals.

36:14.155 --> 36:17.037
Yep, that's the apartment
set right through there.

36:17.100 --> 36:18.862
Oh.

36:20.685 --> 36:22.543
Beth, they need you over
here as a stand-in.

36:22.604 --> 36:25.393
That is if you and Jess are
done babysitting that writer.

36:25.453 --> 36:27.599
Yeah, okay. I'll be right down.

36:27.661 --> 36:30.481
All right, well, I guess
they're ready for my close-up,

36:30.542 --> 36:32.719
so I'll see you guys later.

36:32.782 --> 36:34.351
- See ya.
- Bye.

36:38.383 --> 36:40.562
"Babysit"?

36:42.095 --> 36:45.204
If it's any consolation, you're
better trained than the dog.

37:06.770 --> 37:08.180
Yeah?

37:14.547 --> 37:16.789
Yeah, hello?

37:26.965 --> 37:28.757
Hello?

37:37.174 --> 37:40.154
Oh! Fuck!

37:42.934 --> 37:44.472
Ha! Got you.

37:44.535 --> 37:47.288
- Was that you on the radio?
- Yes. What took you so long?

37:47.350 --> 37:49.435
I've been back there squatting
for like half an hour.

37:49.498 --> 37:52.412
- I got lost a little bit.
- I think my ass is asleep.

37:52.472 --> 37:53.969
- That is so unfortunate.
- Work it out.

37:54.007 --> 37:57.531
- Totally worth it. Back to work?
- Yeah.

37:57.593 --> 38:00.252
Hey, Jurgen?
Yeah, I totally got her, dude.

38:00.312 --> 38:02.204
Ha ha! Did she wet her pants?

38:02.265 --> 38:03.834
I don't know if she peed.
Let me check.

38:03.898 --> 38:05.211
- Shut up!
- Yeah, she peed.

38:05.273 --> 38:06.963
You are such a son of
a bitch. You know that?

38:18.460 --> 38:20.700
Oh, yes!

38:20.763 --> 38:23.134
Oh, so cool! So cool!

38:23.195 --> 38:25.181
Awesome! I mean it.

38:25.243 --> 38:26.203
Oh.

38:28.379 --> 38:30.717
Ha! This is so cool.

38:30.781 --> 38:32.543
What is this?

38:33.788 --> 38:35.455
What is this?

38:35.518 --> 38:38.688
Oh, it's the fake blood. Oh, man!

38:38.748 --> 38:40.512
Oh, man, oh!

38:43.071 --> 38:45.889
Ha ha ha! This is so cool.

38:45.952 --> 38:48.288
Ha! What is this?

38:48.349 --> 38:50.306
Oh!

38:50.368 --> 38:53.666
Oh, nasty! Nasty.

38:53.729 --> 38:56.930
Oh! Oh, man.

39:00.671 --> 39:02.143
Hi.

39:03.360 --> 39:05.698
Is there something I
can help you with?

39:05.760 --> 39:09.284
Um, no, I just... I was
just looking around.

39:09.344 --> 39:11.395
Oh.

39:11.456 --> 39:12.994
Hey, um...

39:13.058 --> 39:16.196
you're the one who did those
head shots from before, right?

39:16.257 --> 39:18.115
- The ones with the blood on the wall?
- Oh, yeah, I know.

39:18.177 --> 39:20.354
Yeah, those were
fucking awesome, man.

39:20.420 --> 39:22.115
Yeah, you like that shit?

39:22.178 --> 39:25.094
- Yeah, I like that shit.
- I love that shit.

39:25.155 --> 39:27.526
- Yeah.
- Want me to show you how that works?

39:27.588 --> 39:29.701
- Could you?
- Absolutely.

39:29.763 --> 39:32.423
- I'd love that.
- Yeah, just go sit down over there.

39:32.484 --> 39:34.855
- Awesome.
- Yeah yeah, go ahead.

39:34.917 --> 39:37.094
- Um...
- Right there, get a bench.

39:37.155 --> 39:38.854
Okay.

39:38.917 --> 39:42.537
Close your eyes, just like that.

39:42.599 --> 39:43.974
Okay, so what's it gonna be?

39:44.037 --> 39:45.733
- Just sit tight.
- Come on, man.

39:45.796 --> 39:47.173
All right.

39:47.238 --> 39:48.903
Oh!

39:50.021 --> 39:52.137
- This is so cool.
- Now...

39:52.199 --> 39:53.831
don't look.

39:53.894 --> 39:55.815
Right. Not looking... got it.

40:01.126 --> 40:02.472
That's kind of cold.

40:02.535 --> 40:05.002
- It sort of tickles.
- Shh.

40:07.784 --> 40:10.795
Jesus. Hey, you hear that?

40:10.855 --> 40:12.554
What?

40:20.842 --> 40:22.411
Who the fuck said you
could listen to music?

40:22.473 --> 40:24.748
- We're holding.
- Ah! I don't care.

40:24.810 --> 40:26.956
- You understand me? I don't care.
- "I don't care."

40:27.019 --> 40:28.333
- Yeah.
- I hear you.

40:28.394 --> 40:29.834
We're supposed to be working here.

40:29.898 --> 40:31.885
We're not supposed to be
listening to fucking music.

40:31.947 --> 40:34.445
We're not supposed to be giving
the wall a boom-mike rubdown.

40:34.507 --> 40:37.423
- Well...
- We're supposed to be working.

40:37.483 --> 40:38.990
- You understand.
- Yeah, yeah.

40:39.053 --> 40:41.774
- Get rid of these fucking things.
- Okay.

40:41.835 --> 40:42.699
Jesus fucking...

40:47.982 --> 40:52.627
So this is where the good
doctor killed himself.

40:54.447 --> 40:56.047
You're serious?

40:56.109 --> 40:59.921
I mean, there's probably a couple
splatters left behind there, but...

40:59.982 --> 41:02.385
That is messed up.

41:02.447 --> 41:05.810
Okay, let's get you to where
you need to be going.

41:05.872 --> 41:09.075
- So this is where we are now.
- Right.

41:09.136 --> 41:12.082
- This is where you need to go.
- Right.

41:12.145 --> 41:14.963
And this is the elevator
to the third floor.

41:15.024 --> 41:16.562
- Third floor.
- Third floor.

41:16.625 --> 41:18.802
- Think you can find your way?
- I think I can handle it.

41:18.864 --> 41:22.327
Besides, I wouldn't want you to babysit
me any longer than you have to.

41:24.593 --> 41:26.996
- Bye.
- Bye.

41:29.234 --> 41:31.027
- Oh, Chris?
- Yeah?

41:31.090 --> 41:33.492
- The elevator's that way.
- Right.

41:52.244 --> 41:54.326
You have a little accident there?

41:56.628 --> 41:58.327
Get the fuck out of here!

41:58.389 --> 41:59.639
Do you need some help?

42:01.814 --> 42:03.352
Okay.

43:12.765 --> 43:14.816
Hey, you made it. Grab a seat.

43:19.808 --> 43:21.569
Yikes, what happened
to our lead actress?

43:21.631 --> 43:24.225
Somebody better get makeup
down there and quick.

43:58.979 --> 44:02.504
I did not sign up to
pick up your crap.

44:48.777 --> 44:50.667
Wait, did you see that?

44:55.723 --> 44:57.805
You want some coffee?

44:57.867 --> 44:59.757
Um, no.

44:59.818 --> 45:01.838
No, I'm gonna go down to
the offices, I think,

45:01.900 --> 45:04.045
and lay down for a little while.

45:04.107 --> 45:07.727
Okay. I'll let you know if
anything interesting happens.

45:19.212 --> 45:21.101
Hey, Darrell.

45:22.477 --> 45:24.303
Is anybody listening to me?

45:24.364 --> 45:25.840
For God's sake, am I the only one

45:25.902 --> 45:27.983
who's going to do work around
here right now or what?

45:31.919 --> 45:34.642
Cut. Rachel, can you hit
your fucking mark, please?

45:34.703 --> 45:37.489
What? Do you want me
to act or hit my mark?

45:37.550 --> 45:39.345
- I want you to do both, okay?
- Okay, well, I can't.

45:39.408 --> 45:41.106
- Do you see this? This is ridiculous.
- You can't?

45:41.169 --> 45:43.892
- How do I look?
- You look good.

45:43.953 --> 45:45.874
Thanks.

45:49.072 --> 45:50.962
Action.

45:53.585 --> 45:56.340
God. I'm sorry.

45:56.402 --> 45:57.746
On the floor... you see that?

45:57.810 --> 45:59.252
How was the rest of your tour?

45:59.315 --> 46:00.723
It's pretty creepy over there.

46:00.786 --> 46:02.707
Yeah, I can imagine.

46:02.771 --> 46:05.750
- I have to pee.
- Can I get a fucking TA?

46:05.812 --> 46:09.430
Beth, Rachel needs a 10-1.

46:09.491 --> 46:12.086
All right, I'm on my way over.

46:12.149 --> 46:13.302
10-1?

46:13.365 --> 46:15.797
Yeah, it's a bathroom break.

46:15.860 --> 46:19.032
I don't really know why they give it
a code. Everyone knows what it means.

46:19.093 --> 46:21.208
Is there a 10-2?

46:23.509 --> 46:25.238
Mitch, I need you to start

46:25.300 --> 46:26.999
cleaning out that pool
for the next shot.

46:27.064 --> 46:29.144
Yeah, I'm on it.

46:29.205 --> 46:31.223
God damn it, Darrell.

46:33.398 --> 46:35.481
A six-year-old leaves
less of a mess.

46:35.544 --> 46:37.977
Can't you have done
something right for once?

46:47.226 --> 46:49.115
I'm putting that kid on fire duty.

47:02.777 --> 47:05.693
Rusty, you just went out.

47:47.039 --> 47:48.864
Hello?

48:35.045 --> 48:36.613
Hello?

48:42.341 --> 48:44.009
Hey, are you okay?

48:58.311 --> 49:01.162
- You married?
- No.

49:02.185 --> 49:03.594
Boyfriend?

49:03.656 --> 49:05.449
No.

49:05.511 --> 49:07.305
Lesbo?

49:07.369 --> 49:09.578
You are unbelievable.

49:09.640 --> 49:11.690
Do you want to go make out?

49:11.753 --> 49:14.091
Are you for real?

49:14.154 --> 49:16.812
I guess you'll never find out.

49:16.874 --> 49:18.542
I guess I won't.

49:21.484 --> 49:24.398
Did I just interrupt something?

49:24.460 --> 49:26.254
Not hardly.

49:26.315 --> 49:29.390
Oh, Jack, you need to be
stubble-free for the next scene.

49:29.452 --> 49:31.150
- Go and shave. Okay.
- You got it.

50:12.978 --> 50:14.513
Hello?

50:17.105 --> 50:18.739
Quit fucking around up there.

50:18.803 --> 50:20.660
This place is creepy
enough as it is.

51:00.311 --> 51:01.945
Yeah, we need a
little more up here.

51:02.008 --> 51:03.256
Okay.

51:06.007 --> 51:08.376
- Whop! Wham.
- Great, yep.

51:08.438 --> 51:10.553
- Some up here.
- Face? All right.

51:10.616 --> 51:12.441
- Oh, yeah.
- Perfect.

51:12.504 --> 51:15.324
- That was a good one.
- Yeah.

53:02.246 --> 53:04.488
Yes. More, more.

53:04.552 --> 53:06.279
Harder! Cut.

53:06.342 --> 53:08.362
Rachel, that was perfect.

53:08.422 --> 53:10.887
- Can I go clean up now?
- Yeah, go wash up.

53:10.950 --> 53:13.000
Thank God.

53:55.404 --> 53:57.678
So are you guarding the food table?

53:57.739 --> 54:00.142
No, it's just not much
seems to be happening.

54:00.205 --> 54:02.191
They're still setting up the shot.

54:02.253 --> 54:05.168
So where have you been hiding?

54:05.228 --> 54:06.669
Nowhere.

54:06.732 --> 54:09.937
I've been moving things
from one place to the next.

54:09.997 --> 54:12.942
That seems to be what my job is...

54:13.005 --> 54:14.927
just lugging stuff.

54:14.990 --> 54:17.039
Why?

54:17.101 --> 54:18.768
You been looking for me?

54:28.528 --> 54:30.001
Shit.

54:31.566 --> 54:33.684
- Do you want one of these?
- Thanks.

54:36.975 --> 54:38.769
I used to work in the
corporate world...

54:39.824 --> 54:42.065
as an office manager.

54:42.127 --> 54:43.602
Really?

54:43.665 --> 54:45.810
Yeah.

54:45.872 --> 54:49.814
Like, it wasn't fulfilling at all.

54:49.874 --> 54:53.815
And now you lug gear around
and you find that fulfilling.

54:53.875 --> 54:57.591
Actually, yes, I do.

54:57.651 --> 54:58.932
Beth?

55:01.747 --> 55:03.509
Yeah?

55:03.572 --> 55:05.301
I need you down in the basement.

55:05.364 --> 55:06.932
We got a major clusterfuck
on our hands.

55:06.994 --> 55:09.974
- It's all flooded.
- Shit. All right.

55:10.036 --> 55:12.214
All right, I'll be right there.

55:12.276 --> 55:14.486
Well, duty calls.

55:14.548 --> 55:16.662
Catch you later.

55:16.726 --> 55:18.008
Don't get lost.

55:34.807 --> 55:38.266
All right, Darrell,

55:38.327 --> 55:40.568
let's get as much stuff
up to the lobby as we can

55:40.632 --> 55:42.457
and then we can account
for it up there.

55:42.520 --> 55:44.121
Okay, you got it.

55:44.183 --> 55:45.786
Hey, Mitch?

55:53.752 --> 55:55.291
Mitch?

56:00.602 --> 56:03.774
That's weird. Where the hell is he?

56:03.837 --> 56:06.237
Mitch.

56:06.298 --> 56:08.927
Oh, God, water everywhere.

56:24.285 --> 56:28.641
Argh, matey! We're sinking!

56:28.701 --> 56:31.391
Darrell, will you please
stop screwing around?

56:33.309 --> 56:34.624
Okay.

56:37.086 --> 56:38.784
What the hell was that?

57:36.968 --> 57:38.951
Darrell?

57:41.769 --> 57:44.041
Come on, that's not funny.

57:49.927 --> 57:51.881
Darrell?

58:21.356 --> 58:22.605
Darrell?

01:00:04.024 --> 01:00:06.650
Let's get you out of that skin.

01:01:02.816 --> 01:01:04.543
Does anyone have eyes on Zeke?

01:01:06.942 --> 01:01:08.000
Zeke?

01:01:08.063 --> 01:01:09.760
He's not answering.

01:01:09.823 --> 01:01:11.392
And where the hell is Jack?

01:01:12.414 --> 01:01:14.944
Okay, 10 minutes, everyone.

01:01:22.559 --> 01:01:24.996
- Where's Bruce?
- What?

01:01:25.057 --> 01:01:28.261
- Where's Bruce?
- I don't know.

01:01:28.322 --> 01:01:29.859
Everybody's fucking AWOL.

01:01:29.921 --> 01:01:31.395
All right, we're taking 10.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.502
It was the worst movie
I ever worked on.

01:01:54.565 --> 01:01:56.069
The whole thing was
a waste of time.

01:01:56.132 --> 01:01:58.280
- The whole thing was a waste of time!
- Mm, yeah.

01:01:58.342 --> 01:02:01.576
- You say that every time, Mark.
- Hey, sweetheart.

01:02:01.637 --> 01:02:05.609
Could you whip me up one of those
protein smoothies of yours?

01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:06.887
Sure.

01:02:06.951 --> 01:02:08.295
Thanks, doll.

01:02:08.359 --> 01:02:11.433
You're a peach! Love you.

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:14.185
Mmm.

01:03:07.181 --> 01:03:09.584
I mean, we're jammed
up through September

01:03:09.646 --> 01:03:11.088
and then squat, nothing.

01:03:11.151 --> 01:03:13.169
- You always say that and then...
- Yeah.

01:03:13.231 --> 01:03:16.851
- I know. Thanks.
- Looks like your smoothie is here, bud.

01:03:19.952 --> 01:03:23.827
Oh! This thing tastes like shit.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:51.092
Hey, Detroit?

01:03:51.156 --> 01:03:52.310
What is it?

01:03:52.373 --> 01:03:54.293
Yeah, have you seen Mitch
or Darrell anywhere?

01:03:54.355 --> 01:03:57.335
No, I can't find anybody.
Everybody's missing.

01:03:57.396 --> 01:03:59.221
Un-fucking-believable.

01:04:11.956 --> 01:04:14.037
Bruce?

01:04:16.407 --> 01:04:19.416
Bruce? Jesus Christ, Bruce,
what the hell are you doing?

01:04:21.143 --> 01:04:22.583
Stop!

01:04:26.391 --> 01:04:27.544
Bruce, stop.

01:05:59.490 --> 01:06:01.122
Hello?

01:06:05.540 --> 01:06:07.107
Hello?

01:06:29.349 --> 01:06:30.982
God damn it!

01:06:32.678 --> 01:06:34.792
This is a closed set!

01:07:25.899 --> 01:07:27.245
Rachel?

01:07:31.405 --> 01:07:33.584
I told you they were fake.

01:07:48.975 --> 01:07:50.415
What?

01:07:50.480 --> 01:07:53.459
It is not every day that
you get to rub your nose

01:07:53.519 --> 01:07:55.891
in some young starlet's hoo-has!

01:08:08.403 --> 01:08:09.490
Yeah.

01:08:11.729 --> 01:08:13.460
What do you think?

01:08:13.523 --> 01:08:15.766
I think that you've

01:08:15.827 --> 01:08:17.685
lost your fucking mind.

01:08:17.747 --> 01:08:21.238
I know that, silly.
I mean, how do I look?

01:08:22.578 --> 01:08:25.558
Like you need some serious help.

01:08:25.621 --> 01:08:26.899
Help?

01:08:28.627 --> 01:08:29.908
Have you...

01:08:29.971 --> 01:08:33.176
looked around this place lately?

01:08:33.236 --> 01:08:36.407
You're the one that
needs to join the club.

01:08:36.468 --> 01:08:38.745
There's something
about this place...

01:08:38.805 --> 01:08:41.111
something about it.

01:08:49.335 --> 01:08:51.416
What are you doing?

01:08:55.064 --> 01:08:59.165
See, we've been breathing
this shitty air in for days

01:08:59.224 --> 01:09:02.203
and you just got here. That's...

01:09:02.265 --> 01:09:04.154
that's not fair.

01:09:16.124 --> 01:09:18.044
You want to be difficult.

01:09:18.107 --> 01:09:19.581
I like that.

01:09:35.964 --> 01:09:37.981
Where are you going?

01:09:57.631 --> 01:10:00.768
Stay right there.

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:31.525
Ha!

01:10:38.820 --> 01:10:40.933
The doctor will see you now.

01:11:10.983 --> 01:11:14.027
Zeke? Zeke, don't come any closer.

01:11:14.088 --> 01:11:16.587
- Oh, it itches.
- No!

01:11:16.650 --> 01:11:19.530
Ah! It itches.

01:11:24.554 --> 01:11:28.557
Darrell! Zeke was just back
there and I don't know what...

01:11:35.083 --> 01:11:37.613
Darrell, is this your blood?

01:11:37.676 --> 01:11:39.693
What happened?

01:11:56.877 --> 01:11:58.158
Beth!

01:11:58.222 --> 01:12:00.623
- We need to get out of here.
- What happened to you?

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:03.025
There... there was
an accident. Jack's dead.

01:12:03.088 --> 01:12:04.432
What?

01:12:04.494 --> 01:12:07.825
He attacked me! Listen, we
can talk about this later.

01:12:07.887 --> 01:12:09.840
Come on!

01:12:15.537 --> 01:12:17.042
Chris!

01:12:17.103 --> 01:12:19.152
Harry?

01:12:20.272 --> 01:12:23.603
Hold on a sec. Where
are you guys going?

01:12:23.663 --> 01:12:25.361
Give me the phone.

01:12:25.424 --> 01:12:28.115
But I'm on a call with somebody.

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:31.315
Give me your phone!

01:12:34.161 --> 01:12:37.333
Come on, this place is
making us very sick, okay?

01:12:37.394 --> 01:12:40.147
- We need to get out.
- I don't feel good.

01:12:40.209 --> 01:12:42.356
I know. We need to get out.

01:12:42.419 --> 01:12:44.755
- What about the movie?
- Come on, we need to get outside.

01:12:44.818 --> 01:12:47.798
- I lost my shoe!
- Get it later.

01:12:58.836 --> 01:13:00.886
- Hey.
- Harry.

01:13:00.948 --> 01:13:04.119
- My shoe.
- Harry!

01:13:09.909 --> 01:13:12.724
Hey, going somewhere?

01:13:13.686 --> 01:13:15.959
Mitch.

01:13:40.794 --> 01:13:43.614
Beth! Beth, where are you going?

01:13:43.675 --> 01:13:45.532
Come on, you can't leave now.

01:13:45.594 --> 01:13:48.286
I'm just starting to
have a good time.

01:13:48.348 --> 01:13:50.268
Mitch, no!

01:13:53.914 --> 01:13:56.604
Come on. Give me my
girlfriend back!

01:13:56.667 --> 01:13:58.461
No!

01:14:04.411 --> 01:14:07.100
- It's not working! What do I do?
- I know!

01:14:07.132 --> 01:14:08.734
Chris.

01:14:08.797 --> 01:14:11.068
Here, lift me up.

01:14:21.279 --> 01:14:23.841
Here, give me your hand.

01:14:23.904 --> 01:14:24.992
Yeah.

01:14:25.055 --> 01:14:26.527
- Got it?
- Yup.

01:14:26.591 --> 01:14:28.256
Okay.

01:14:39.456 --> 01:14:42.914
How does this thing open?

01:14:43.137 --> 01:14:46.305
You're not getting
away that easy, bitch.

01:14:56.291 --> 01:14:59.234
Is he dead?

01:15:10.405 --> 01:15:12.742
Chris, hurry!

01:15:53.034 --> 01:15:55.466
Go!

01:16:02.218 --> 01:16:04.970
Let's go!

01:16:13.451 --> 01:16:15.404
Jeez.

01:16:45.776 --> 01:16:48.910
The door doesn't lock!

01:16:57.137 --> 01:16:59.378
Help!

01:17:00.658 --> 01:17:03.060
Help! Help us!

01:17:03.122 --> 01:17:06.227
Somebody help us!

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:13.811
No! No!

01:17:13.873 --> 01:17:15.891
No! Ah, no!

01:17:19.922 --> 01:17:23.510
No!

01:18:28.636 --> 01:18:31.322
