WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.530
You were his sexual
partner for eight months.

00:03.580 --> 00:06.689
He never mentioned sadism,
never asked you to participate?

00:06.740 --> 00:09.050
Well, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

00:09.100 --> 00:11.210
'I don't think anything
did go on up there.

00:11.260 --> 00:13.810
'I never saw him use those items.'

00:13.860 --> 00:18.610
Alistair was... as precocious
sexually as he was intellectually.

00:18.660 --> 00:22.620
Danger, pain, submission, domination.

00:23.820 --> 00:27.250
Is it possible that you enjoyed
extreme sexual encounters

00:27.300 --> 00:30.850
with someone who didn't
want you to know their name?

00:30.900 --> 00:33.210
I don't know what went on in that attic...

00:33.260 --> 00:36.000
and the truth is neither do you.

00:37.860 --> 00:40.960
'I have to buy a battery for my laptop.'

00:46.300 --> 00:49.410
Lots of people think they
have nothing to lose.

00:49.460 --> 00:51.690
But in my professional experience,

00:51.740 --> 00:53.930
they just haven't thought it through.

00:53.980 --> 00:55.980
You threatening me?

00:59.900 --> 01:02.810
Once in a while, someone unexpected

01:02.860 --> 01:06.460
tells you something that
might save your life.

PANTING

01:50.860 --> 01:55.380
Armed police! Police! Stay where
you are! Show us your hands!

02:03.140 --> 02:05.050
Danny?

02:05.100 --> 02:07.300
Danny, what's going on?

02:08.220 --> 02:12.260
Let me go! Get your hands off him. Danny!

02:13.700 --> 02:16.740
SIRENS WAIL

03:05.940 --> 03:07.480
The trunk.

03:09.380 --> 03:14.860
An antique. Wood. Leather.
Steel frame. Very strong.

03:16.580 --> 03:18.890
You claim it was used
to store hiking boots

03:18.940 --> 03:22.640
and other outdoor equipment
in the back of his car?

03:25.020 --> 03:29.530
With a man inside, oxygen levels drop 17%.

03:29.580 --> 03:33.530
The temperature jumps ten degrees.
You become breathless. Sweaty.

03:33.580 --> 03:36.650
- There's a moment of euphoria.
- Euphoria?

03:36.700 --> 03:40.500
Have you ever experimented
with erotic asphyxiation?

03:43.940 --> 03:45.970
"When the brain is deprived of oxygen,

03:46.020 --> 03:49.330
"it induces a semi-hallucinogenic
state called hypoxia.

03:49.380 --> 03:52.880
- "Combined with orgasm..."
- I know what it is.

03:53.420 --> 03:56.170
".. the rush is said to be
no less powerful than cocaine,

03:56.220 --> 03:58.420
"and highly addictive."

03:58.660 --> 04:01.960
You know what it is,
because you've tried it?

04:03.820 --> 04:06.620
- There was a guy.
- A man...

04:08.140 --> 04:10.010
.. Steve Fields.

04:10.820 --> 04:13.490
Did the two of you use a trunk?

04:15.300 --> 04:17.100
We used a belt.

04:20.740 --> 04:23.410
I didn't particularly enjoy
it. I've never done it again.

04:23.460 --> 04:25.610
We were told you engaged
in the practice repeatedly.

04:25.660 --> 04:28.820
It was... three or four times.

04:30.780 --> 04:32.450
With one man.

04:34.740 --> 04:37.480
How close did you come to death?

04:40.340 --> 04:43.210
Erm, we were...

04:43.260 --> 04:44.730
careful.

04:44.780 --> 04:46.290
Because?

04:46.340 --> 04:48.970
Because he was watching. Or I was.

04:49.020 --> 04:52.620
Danny, have you ever passed
out from taking too much G?

04:54.540 --> 04:57.090
Yeah. When I first started using it.

04:57.140 --> 04:58.890
What would you say was a typical dose?

04:58.940 --> 05:00.810
1.5 millilitres?

05:02.540 --> 05:04.410
5.2 millilitres.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.840
Enough for three.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.050
That was the moment

05:12.100 --> 05:15.500
you were supposed to open
the trunk, wasn't it?

05:22.300 --> 05:24.690
What happened that night, Danny?

05:24.740 --> 05:27.740
He asked you to lock him inside the trunk.

05:27.820 --> 05:32.660
You obliged. You sat on the
bed waiting for his high.

05:34.260 --> 05:36.460
Only yours came first.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.040
It came stronger.

05:41.020 --> 05:44.450
You pass out. Nothing could wake you.

05:44.500 --> 05:47.660
Not his cries for help,
the movement of the trunk.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.300
You sat up.

05:52.780 --> 05:56.890
You saw the trunk. On its
side. Halfway across the attic.

05:56.940 --> 05:58.250
Now you're panicking.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.450
You open the locks.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.640
You touch his cheeks.

06:03.940 --> 06:05.730
He's still warm.

06:05.780 --> 06:08.410
You consider calling an ambulance...

06:08.460 --> 06:10.400
of course you do.

06:11.500 --> 06:13.210
But it's too late.

06:13.260 --> 06:15.890
You look around at the
remnants of your night.

06:15.940 --> 06:17.540
The drugs.

06:19.020 --> 06:20.770
The kink.

06:20.820 --> 06:25.290
A jury's going to hate you. You
close the trunk and you leave.

06:25.340 --> 06:28.340
After all, the guy slept around.
You didn't even know his name.

06:30.140 --> 06:33.130
There were others. Maybe we'd
think it was one of them.

06:33.180 --> 06:37.450
Why would I have told you that
there WERE no other people?

06:37.500 --> 06:40.100
There are always other people.

06:46.580 --> 06:49.690
Exclusive. Discreet.

06:49.740 --> 06:52.330
A specialist escort
agency, for the very rich.

06:52.380 --> 06:56.810
- Alex didn't use escorts.
- Could we at least use his real name?

06:56.860 --> 06:58.570
Alistair didn't use escorts.

06:58.620 --> 07:02.720
You both enjoyed the company
of strangers, it would seem.

07:02.940 --> 07:07.420
'I was numb and I posted an ad online...'

07:08.580 --> 07:13.490
'.. saying that anyone could
come round. I mean, anyone.'

07:13.540 --> 07:15.410
How do you have that?

07:15.460 --> 07:17.850
You told him that story over the phone.

07:17.900 --> 07:20.250
No, that was a private conversation!

07:20.300 --> 07:23.850
The apartment belongs to
the security services.

07:23.900 --> 07:26.620
All calls... were recorded.

07:30.420 --> 07:33.520
That conversation took
place in my bedroom.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.450
We were face-to-face!

07:36.500 --> 07:39.370
We've just searched your apartment.

07:39.740 --> 07:42.680
No surveillance equipment was found.

07:52.780 --> 07:57.060
Alex... didn't give me these keys.

07:58.060 --> 08:01.050
He never... He never gave...

08:01.100 --> 08:04.200
He never did give me a... a set of keys.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.140
These... were left!

08:10.980 --> 08:12.920
At the warehouse.

08:14.140 --> 08:18.410
I don't know... I don't know... by who,

08:18.460 --> 08:20.970
'I don't know how they but they were.

08:21.020 --> 08:23.610
'You say that it can't be done, like...'

08:23.660 --> 08:25.330
it's a fact. But it was done!

08:25.380 --> 08:28.250
They were left... They left them...

08:29.420 --> 08:30.810
.. so that I could go to the attic,

08:30.860 --> 08:32.690
so that you would believe all of this,

08:32.740 --> 08:35.340
except it's all a fucking lie!

08:41.340 --> 08:44.440
I'm not the one running
out of time, Danny.

08:45.060 --> 08:47.290
We both know those attic bed sheets,

08:47.340 --> 08:49.570
stained with semen...

08:49.620 --> 08:52.730
and shit... and blood...

08:52.780 --> 08:56.180
are going to come back
as a match for your DNA.

08:56.940 --> 08:59.330
And when they do...

08:59.380 --> 09:01.380
we will charge you.

10:08.220 --> 10:10.220
Have you got a pen?

10:17.220 --> 10:19.490
What did the lawyer say?

10:20.180 --> 10:22.650
He said you should confess.

10:25.380 --> 10:28.480
They built that attic... out of my past.

10:30.660 --> 10:33.400
All the stupid things I've done.

10:35.740 --> 10:37.410
What is that?

10:39.420 --> 10:41.090
Another lie.

11:24.860 --> 11:26.780
HE SHOUTS

11:53.140 --> 11:54.610
Saturday?

11:56.020 --> 11:57.420
Sunday.

11:59.060 --> 12:01.400
You should eat something.

12:08.220 --> 12:10.160
The bed sheets...

12:11.460 --> 12:13.330
.. in the attic.

12:16.140 --> 12:19.440
They're going to come
back a match for my DNA.

12:20.660 --> 12:22.730
How's that possible?

12:24.740 --> 12:26.770
Alex dry-cleaned everything.

12:26.820 --> 12:29.360
That's when they were stolen.

12:34.660 --> 12:37.760
They've been working on this for months.

12:40.860 --> 12:45.060
- And I'll prove it.
- You can't even prove it wasn't you.

12:45.500 --> 12:49.600
You're talking about spies
and conspiracies. Look at you.

13:44.140 --> 13:46.210
- INTERCOM CHIMES
- 'Hello.'

13:46.260 --> 13:47.450
It's me.

13:47.500 --> 13:49.300
INTERCOM BUZZES

14:44.780 --> 14:48.220
Danny! The one that got away.

14:50.700 --> 14:51.980
Rich.

14:54.180 --> 14:56.120
Been a long time.

15:17.500 --> 15:20.700
You don't smoke it,
it's going to be wasted.

15:21.340 --> 15:23.700
Look -- it's getting away.

15:43.820 --> 15:46.340
I'm good. Thanks.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.380
You're not a man who usually says no.

16:08.460 --> 16:11.460
- I need information.
- Information?

16:12.780 --> 16:16.820
How grown up you've become. What
information could you possibly want?

16:27.980 --> 16:31.080
- Who gave you this?
- I was shown it.

16:31.780 --> 16:34.780
- Who showed you it?
- Could you help me?

16:36.540 --> 16:38.880
You know them, don't you?

16:39.420 --> 16:42.980
I need to... I need to
speak to those people.

16:45.140 --> 16:47.880
- Impossible.
- It's important.

16:50.620 --> 16:52.020
Come on.

17:02.180 --> 17:04.130
Closer.

17:04.180 --> 17:05.579
Closer.

17:07.940 --> 17:09.339
Closer.

17:58.580 --> 17:59.920
Danny?

18:08.740 --> 18:12.100
You have the very particular
stink of a man out of his depth.

18:18.380 --> 18:20.250
Can you help me?

18:28.380 --> 18:31.130
For important information
there's a price, Danny.

18:31.180 --> 18:34.810
You have any idea how
upset these people would be

18:34.860 --> 18:38.360
if I shared their secrets
with the likes of you?

18:39.220 --> 18:42.320
Why don't you take a moment, freshen up?

18:43.820 --> 18:46.090
And then ask yourself...

18:47.540 --> 18:52.140
.."How badly do I want this?" Hmm?

19:30.780 --> 19:33.320
I'm going to die in this tub.

19:35.260 --> 19:37.600
Heart attack or a stroke.

19:40.380 --> 19:44.820
They'll find me here...
tongue hanging out...

19:46.980 --> 19:50.140
.. my little dick bobbing
about in the bubble bath.

19:53.660 --> 19:56.460
Four strong men will heave me out.

19:57.180 --> 20:02.340
My flesh will... slosh and
slop on the marble floor.

20:05.100 --> 20:07.640
And they'll write about me...

20:09.140 --> 20:12.540
.."He was a man who always
got what he wanted".

20:15.100 --> 20:16.500
I can't.

20:17.420 --> 20:19.160
Then fuck off!

20:54.900 --> 20:56.570
What's wrong?

21:02.260 --> 21:04.460
Why didn't you tell me?

21:06.300 --> 21:08.040
Tell you what?

21:21.820 --> 21:23.760
Danny, I found it.

21:24.260 --> 21:25.860
Found what?

21:26.940 --> 21:28.810
Your medication.

21:30.340 --> 21:32.610
Sara, what did you find?

21:59.820 --> 22:01.160
Danny?

22:03.700 --> 22:05.040
Danny?

22:08.420 --> 22:12.810
'Last test was eight months ago,
since then one sexual partner.'

22:12.860 --> 22:15.600
- You're always safe?
- Always.

22:16.540 --> 22:19.770
- Do you use a condom
during oral sex? - No.

22:19.820 --> 22:22.860
Well, it's low-risk but not no-risk.

22:24.060 --> 22:27.060
We're going to do a finger prick test.

22:27.660 --> 22:30.730
It's not a test for the HIV virus

22:30.780 --> 22:34.340
but for the antibodies produced
in response to the infection.

22:35.900 --> 22:38.930
It'll detect infection
six weeks after exposure.

22:38.980 --> 22:42.930
I haven't had sexual contact
of any kind for over six weeks.

22:42.980 --> 22:45.920
Then this result will be up to date.

22:46.900 --> 22:49.640
I need to ask, before the test...

22:50.500 --> 22:53.600
.. if the results come back positive...

22:54.700 --> 22:57.500
.. is there someone you can phone?

23:00.660 --> 23:02.690
We have a support network.

23:02.740 --> 23:05.940
So no-one's ever alone. Just so you know.

23:15.940 --> 23:18.610
Going to feel a slight scratch.

23:35.220 --> 23:37.960
This'll just take a few minutes.

24:51.020 --> 24:53.220
The result is reactive.

24:54.140 --> 24:58.650
We use the word reactive
because 7 out of a 1,000 results

24:58.700 --> 25:01.860
come back as a false
reactive result. So...

25:09.660 --> 25:11.690
Danny?

25:11.740 --> 25:14.820
Danny, why don't you take a seat for me?

25:20.220 --> 25:21.820
Danny?

25:33.260 --> 25:40.010
Two dots indicate the presence
of antibodies to the HIV virus.

25:40.060 --> 25:44.450
So I need to take a second
sample, run a second test

25:44.500 --> 25:48.900
- so that I can rule out the chance of
a false result. - It's not... possible.

25:52.140 --> 25:54.540
Let's run the second test.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.960
- Would you like someone
to wait with you? - No.

28:51.540 --> 28:52.880
Danny?

28:58.940 --> 29:01.940
- I know how they did it!
- Danny...

29:02.620 --> 29:06.210
- I know! - Danny. - I know! - Danny.

29:06.260 --> 29:07.660
I know!

29:09.020 --> 29:12.120
Danny, why don't you take a seat for me?

29:18.180 --> 29:21.580
Danny... can you give me the needle?

29:23.780 --> 29:25.450
Danny?

29:25.500 --> 29:27.500
Give me the needle.

29:27.940 --> 29:30.180
(OK. OK.)

29:41.460 --> 29:44.000
Is there someone we can call?

29:49.860 --> 29:52.810
When they took... my blood
at the police station,

29:52.860 --> 29:56.060
they must have injected
me at the same time.

30:01.420 --> 30:04.780
The... The virus can't...
can't survive outside the body.

30:06.740 --> 30:08.980
They must have, um...

30:10.460 --> 30:13.060
They must have kept it heated?

30:17.980 --> 30:20.450
And I, I, I, I know that...

30:21.700 --> 30:25.890
.. it takes more than six weeks for
it to show up on the test and...

30:25.940 --> 30:29.240
it wasn't that long ago
but they must have...

30:32.020 --> 30:35.520
I don't know, I don't
know how they did it. I...

30:36.260 --> 30:38.730
[HE SIGHS] But they did it!

30:42.220 --> 30:44.490
They did it. [HE SNIFFS]

30:46.460 --> 30:49.500
HE SOBS

30:56.940 --> 31:00.660
Scottie... you have to believe me!

31:03.780 --> 31:05.340
Please.

31:06.700 --> 31:08.250
Please!

31:08.300 --> 31:13.180
I remember taking you to
hospital... all those years ago.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.600
There was a chance you'd been infected.

31:20.660 --> 31:23.060
We barely knew each other.

31:23.860 --> 31:25.800
You were so young.

31:26.820 --> 31:29.020
More child than adult.

31:29.620 --> 31:32.650
I made you promise never to
take a risk like that again.

31:32.700 --> 31:36.010
- Scottie, I swear!
- You promised. You promised me.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.530
I never broke that promise.

31:39.580 --> 31:41.380
I swear to you!

31:42.620 --> 31:45.330
If you don't believe me,
I don't have anyone else,

31:45.380 --> 31:48.180
Scottie, I don't have anyone else!

31:49.820 --> 31:51.890
You have to believe.

31:55.020 --> 31:56.760
I believe you.

32:00.420 --> 32:04.130
I knew you were a young man
who'd make a lot of mistakes.

32:04.180 --> 32:06.490
But never the same one twice.

32:06.540 --> 32:08.280
I believe you.

32:09.660 --> 32:12.860
I believe they deliberately infected you.

32:13.780 --> 32:16.250
Not to kill you, obviously.

32:16.820 --> 32:19.940
With medication, you'll
live a long and normal life.

32:21.540 --> 32:24.080
They did it to discredit you.

32:24.940 --> 32:27.810
They'll say you took risks
with your own health.

32:27.860 --> 32:30.960
You were reckless... and irresponsible.

32:33.780 --> 32:36.170
Perhaps they'll even say
that you infected Alex.

32:36.220 --> 32:39.320
- No. He, he was...
- He was negative.

32:40.780 --> 32:43.250
But what will the test say?

32:45.020 --> 32:47.690
The story of you two has been written.

32:47.740 --> 32:50.170
It was written many months ago.

32:50.220 --> 32:52.090
A sordid tale...

32:53.620 --> 32:57.060
.. the details of which will
leak out into the public sphere.

32:59.020 --> 33:01.020
People will recoil.

33:02.020 --> 33:05.020
Many will think you got what you deserved.

33:06.260 --> 33:10.220
No-one will campaign for answers.
No-one will demand justice.

33:12.740 --> 33:15.080
- These people...
- Yes.

33:19.020 --> 33:21.220
.. they'd do anything.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.260
Yes.

33:28.500 --> 33:30.500
- I can't...
- No.

33:31.820 --> 33:33.490
I loved him.

33:34.020 --> 33:36.220
I loved him very much.

33:37.420 --> 33:39.420
I can't fight them.

34:00.100 --> 34:05.730
A long time ago, I had a lover.
He was an aspiring artist.

34:05.780 --> 34:07.650
Quite promising.

34:08.060 --> 34:10.460
Extraordinarily beautiful.

34:11.260 --> 34:12.530
1983.

34:14.500 --> 34:17.800
He was one of the first
in London to fall ill.

34:19.020 --> 34:22.020
Back then, it didn't even have a name.

34:22.420 --> 34:23.850
There was no information.

34:23.900 --> 34:27.460
No leaflets. No warnings. No answers.

34:29.300 --> 34:32.300
You'd watch the news and
hear no mention of it.

34:33.820 --> 34:35.690
A secret plague.

34:37.739 --> 34:39.810
I'd visit him as often as I could,

34:39.860 --> 34:43.260
with as much fresh fruit and
vegetables as I could carry.

34:45.060 --> 34:48.260
He'd been given a book on colour therapy.

34:49.100 --> 34:54.100
In it, blue was described as
having healing properties.

34:56.580 --> 34:58.300
Blue...

34:59.940 --> 35:03.140
.. blue alone, was able
to fight infections.

35:06.300 --> 35:09.580
Blue... blue alone, could save him.

35:11.740 --> 35:13.010
Blue.

35:17.660 --> 35:21.180
No doubt the idea appealed
to his artistic sensibilities.

35:24.060 --> 35:28.610
Back then, mysticism and
magic stood in for medicine.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.050
He wouldn't accept the
fresh fruit and vegetables

35:31.100 --> 35:33.500
because they weren't blue.

35:34.740 --> 35:38.500
But, since water was blue, he
eventually agreed to take a bath.

35:44.700 --> 35:47.420
I told him that he'd given up.

35:48.820 --> 35:50.560
He must fight.

35:51.380 --> 35:52.980
He refused.

35:53.820 --> 35:58.330
He said that I'd never faced
the inevitability of defeat.

35:58.380 --> 36:02.450
He was going to die. He was
going to suffer, suffer terribly.

36:02.500 --> 36:07.200
There was nothing he could do.
There was nothing anyone could do.

36:09.140 --> 36:11.680
He was right. On both counts.

36:13.780 --> 36:15.980
He did suffer terribly.

36:17.460 --> 36:21.160
And I have never faced the
inevitability of defeat.

36:36.580 --> 36:38.520
It is impossible.

36:40.660 --> 36:42.330
We will lose.

36:43.660 --> 36:45.600
But we will fight.

38:36.740 --> 38:39.090
I'm ready.

38:39.140 --> 38:40.540
Are you?

38:41.780 --> 38:43.570
Yes.

38:43.620 --> 38:46.220
When are you going to tell me?

38:47.660 --> 38:50.330
The secret you've been keeping.

38:52.020 --> 38:54.220
You knew all the time?

38:56.700 --> 38:58.840
Not here. Downstairs.

39:15.460 --> 39:17.600
- Tell me.
- I lied.

39:19.060 --> 39:20.400
About?

39:21.700 --> 39:25.060
I stole something... from the attic.

39:26.660 --> 39:28.400
You lied well.

39:29.100 --> 39:31.300
It's a locked cylinder.

39:36.900 --> 39:40.140
- You lied wisely.
- It needs a code.

39:42.660 --> 39:45.260
- Which you don't know?
- No.

39:46.340 --> 39:48.810
Did Alex intend it for you?

39:50.980 --> 39:53.320
He told me where to look.

39:53.980 --> 39:57.020
Then he must have believed
you capable of opening it.

40:00.740 --> 40:04.780
- I've gone over every conversation,
every word. - Go over them again.

40:06.820 --> 40:11.580
Remember... he would have been aware
that you were under surveillance.

40:13.540 --> 40:16.540
Danny, you've got to figure it
out. You're the only one who can.

40:21.060 --> 40:24.660
Where is it now? You
haven't kept it at the flat?

40:26.860 --> 40:29.460
You were right to be cautious.

40:29.660 --> 40:32.400
If they knew that you had this...

40:34.820 --> 40:38.570
.. they'd have behaved quite differently.

40:38.620 --> 40:40.570
Secrets have changed.

40:40.620 --> 40:44.610
It used to be typed documents,
stashed inside manila files.

40:44.660 --> 40:50.410
Pages of paper stamped
"Confidential". Rolls of microfilm.

40:50.460 --> 40:53.000
Now it's numbers. Algorithms.

40:54.940 --> 40:59.140
The contents of that cylinder are
almost certainly incomprehensible.

41:00.340 --> 41:01.730
At least to us.

41:01.780 --> 41:03.650
We need an ally.

41:06.260 --> 41:07.930
A great mind.

41:18.980 --> 41:22.330
Some of the people we need to speak to...

41:22.380 --> 41:25.120
care very much about appearances.

41:26.700 --> 41:30.940
They look at the cut of your suit
before they listen to what you say.

41:33.300 --> 41:35.500
It's not about wealth.

41:37.180 --> 41:39.650
It's about a set of signals.

41:40.500 --> 41:44.220
They require a lifetime of study,
which is precisely the point.

41:47.500 --> 41:50.500
Wealth can be acquired in an instant.

41:51.140 --> 41:54.080
Tonight we must play by their rules.

41:54.820 --> 41:57.160
- Fits.
- SCOTTIE SCOFFS

41:59.220 --> 42:02.860
What sort of spy would I be if I
couldn't guess a man's shirt size?

42:20.300 --> 42:22.090
So who is she?

42:22.140 --> 42:24.170
She's the President and Provost Professor

42:24.220 --> 42:26.690
of the University of London.

42:27.660 --> 42:29.210
Can we trust her?

42:29.260 --> 42:32.060
There's no art in trusting nobody.

42:32.380 --> 42:37.380
The craft of a spy has always been
to choose the right people to trust.

42:39.180 --> 42:42.140
- You're friends?
- Friends, yes.

43:15.980 --> 43:17.690
They'll be aware of my connection to her.

43:17.740 --> 43:20.050
They'll have anticipated this meeting.

43:20.100 --> 43:23.200
Her office will almost
certainly be bugged.

43:29.420 --> 43:31.890
Empty your pockets, please.

43:40.860 --> 43:42.330
This way.

43:53.100 --> 43:54.640
Thank you.

44:05.020 --> 44:07.330
You haven't lost your
taste for theatricality.

44:07.380 --> 44:09.650
For once it's justified.

44:10.380 --> 44:13.930
So what's this about? Why
couldn't you tell me on the phone?

44:13.980 --> 44:17.700
A former student of your
university. A prodigy.

44:19.220 --> 44:21.490
You might know him as Alistair Turner.

44:21.540 --> 44:24.210
But he preferred the name Alex.

44:25.820 --> 44:27.450
Let's walk.

44:27.500 --> 44:30.980
I didn't know Alex well
personally. Mainly by reputation.

44:32.180 --> 44:33.570
There aren't many students

44:33.620 --> 44:37.220
- who start their degree at 15.
- He was murdered.

44:38.660 --> 44:40.930
He WAS murdered, Claire.

44:45.180 --> 44:48.680
So I take it you want to
speak to his professor?

44:48.930 --> 44:49.930
Marcus Shaw.

44:49.980 --> 44:53.080
- What do you know about him?
- Brilliant.

44:53.180 --> 44:55.650
- Difficult.
- And his relationship with Alex?

44:55.700 --> 44:58.460
- They were close.
- Sexual?

44:59.940 --> 45:03.420
I'm confident that their
intimacy was purely intellectual.

45:07.340 --> 45:11.610
- Will he talk to us?
- Marcus is precise. He won't "chat".

45:11.660 --> 45:13.450
Unless you're talking about mathematics,

45:13.500 --> 45:15.930
the discussion will be a waste of time.

45:15.980 --> 45:19.860
Is it possible that Alex
would have confided in him?

45:23.780 --> 45:27.100
- That's a very serious allegation.
- I'm just thinking aloud.

45:29.660 --> 45:31.730
Marcus admired Alex.

45:32.620 --> 45:36.020
On some level, he might
have envied him, but...

45:37.220 --> 45:38.970
.. I can't believe he'd want to harm him.

45:39.020 --> 45:41.010
Could you arrange a meeting?

45:41.060 --> 45:44.450
So you do have something specific
you're going to speak to him about?

45:44.500 --> 45:48.210
- We will. - Don't send
e-mails. Don't make calls.

45:48.260 --> 45:52.050
They'll have access to your
computer, your office, your phone.

45:52.100 --> 45:56.400
- Claire, I should warn you...
- He was my student, Scottie.

46:00.060 --> 46:02.860
- Where now?
- A club, I thought.

46:10.660 --> 46:12.970
Don't admire your surroundings.

46:13.020 --> 46:16.050
Affect an air of mild
boredom. Don't take it too far.

46:16.100 --> 46:19.370
It needs to feel effortless. Making
an effort is the surest giveaway.

46:19.420 --> 46:21.570
I don't think this is going to work.

46:21.620 --> 46:25.650
All we need is enough uncertainty
for them to let you inside.

46:25.700 --> 46:29.700
The advantage is with us. More
than anything they despise a scene.

46:37.100 --> 46:40.700
- Good evening. - Good
evening, sir. - One guest.

47:18.260 --> 47:22.420
- How do you know what anything costs?
- Everything goes on account.

47:23.620 --> 47:25.450
It's assumed members can pay their way.

47:25.500 --> 47:28.600
Money's never mentioned,
seen or discussed.

47:41.860 --> 47:44.730
There are more women in a gay club.

47:45.460 --> 47:47.600
Women aren't allowed.

47:48.140 --> 47:49.690
(Is that legal?)

47:49.740 --> 47:52.210
How many do you think apply?

47:56.180 --> 47:58.050
Good to see you.

47:58.340 --> 48:01.280
You look fantastic as always, James.

48:01.860 --> 48:03.970
Danny.

48:04.020 --> 48:07.220
James and I have worked
together for over 30 years.

48:08.540 --> 48:11.730
Not really "together", Scottie.

48:11.780 --> 48:14.320
CHUCKLING: No, I suppose not.

48:16.340 --> 48:17.740
James...

48:18.860 --> 48:21.090
I'm afraid I need to ask a favour.

48:21.140 --> 48:23.780
- A favour?
- I'm afraid so.

48:27.100 --> 48:31.060
- Scottie, this is unlike you.
- The situation is exceptional.

48:33.380 --> 48:34.920
Very well.

48:36.180 --> 48:39.780
What can you tell me about
the murder of Alistair Turner?

48:42.860 --> 48:44.930
Have you lost your mind?

48:44.980 --> 48:47.930
I'm asking you to be indiscreet.

48:47.980 --> 48:51.020
The quid pro quo is that I will not be.

48:52.780 --> 48:56.020
You've been hanging around too
many street corners, old friend.

48:57.460 --> 49:00.210
Your acquaintance is
beginning to rub off on you.

49:00.260 --> 49:01.850
Oh, no.

49:01.900 --> 49:04.770
I learnt these tricks from the top.

49:08.100 --> 49:11.340
- You sure you want to continue
down this road? - Quite sure.

49:13.780 --> 49:15.980
That's an awful shame.

49:17.980 --> 49:20.980
I'll tell you a joke. How about that?

49:21.700 --> 49:23.810
It would depend on how funny I found it.

49:23.860 --> 49:25.980
It's hysterical.

49:27.740 --> 49:30.650
An Englishman, a Chinaman...

49:30.700 --> 49:33.730
a Frenchman, an American,

49:33.780 --> 49:38.570
a Russian... an Israeli and a Saudi...

49:38.620 --> 49:40.560
walk into a bar...

49:43.580 --> 49:45.780
.. and they all agree.

49:57.340 --> 50:00.540
You'd better explain it to
your boy at a later stage.

50:04.620 --> 50:07.620
Like I said, old friend, an awful shame.

50:12.500 --> 50:14.100
Time to go.

50:29.900 --> 50:32.900
If I could ask you to settle up, Sir?

50:33.100 --> 50:35.170
Yes, of course, yes.

50:44.260 --> 50:46.210
What did it mean?

50:46.260 --> 50:49.930
That my membership has been
cancelled with immediate effect.

50:49.980 --> 50:52.290
A pity. They do a
marvellous Eggs Benedict.

50:52.340 --> 50:54.810
The joke, Scottie, the joke?

50:54.860 --> 50:58.050
- I thought that was
perfectly clear. - No.

50:58.100 --> 51:01.610
Substitute the nationality
for the security agency.

51:01.660 --> 51:03.250
British MI6.

51:03.300 --> 51:05.330
The Chinese Ministry for State Security.

51:05.380 --> 51:08.850
American CIA. Israeli Mossad.

51:08.900 --> 51:12.300
Russian FSB. The Saudi GIP.

51:14.220 --> 51:15.970
OK?

51:16.020 --> 51:18.890
The punchline was that they all agree.

51:18.940 --> 51:22.050
Danny, they've never
agreed about anything.

51:22.100 --> 51:24.420
Until now... it seems.

51:25.460 --> 51:28.210
Whatever Alex discovered --
whatever it was, whatever it is --

51:28.260 --> 51:30.600
no-one wants in the open.

51:31.380 --> 51:34.250
We're not up against
one intelligence agency.

51:34.300 --> 51:36.700
We're up against them all.

51:37.220 --> 51:39.160
What does it mean?

51:40.540 --> 51:43.010
It means we are quite alone.

52:10.700 --> 52:12.330
- Get in the car.
- What?

52:12.380 --> 52:14.580
Get in the fucking car!

52:19.780 --> 52:22.290
RICH TUTS

52:22.340 --> 52:25.540
Found yourself a rich
Daddy, my fun-loving-friend?

52:28.860 --> 52:33.530
Or is it fun no more, Danny?
Have you fallen out of love?

52:33.580 --> 52:35.050
With fun?

52:36.660 --> 52:41.980
You have. Some people call that
growing up. I call it growing old.

52:43.500 --> 52:46.600
Once you let fun go,
you never get it back.

52:49.900 --> 52:53.000
Over and above everything and anybody...

52:55.380 --> 52:57.250
.. I choose fun.

53:01.580 --> 53:03.250
It's for you.

53:05.260 --> 53:06.730
Not here!

53:10.060 --> 53:13.140
- What is it?
- It's the impossible.

53:15.620 --> 53:18.290
What made you change your mind?

53:20.740 --> 53:22.210
I didn't.

53:24.820 --> 53:26.820
I don't understand.

53:28.020 --> 53:30.020
I'm sure you don't.

53:35.220 --> 53:37.010
Get out.

53:37.060 --> 53:38.930
Get out the car.

53:40.220 --> 53:42.140
Oh, Danny?

53:43.820 --> 53:45.290
Have fun.

54:21.460 --> 54:23.980
PHONE RINGS

55:09.580 --> 55:11.650
I can do this alone.

55:24.460 --> 55:27.330
I would like to finish this
particular adventure with you,

55:27.380 --> 55:28.490
Daniel Edward Holt.

55:28.540 --> 55:29.970
Can it be opened?

55:30.020 --> 55:32.160
If you know the code.

55:38.900 --> 55:41.010
We did it for me.

55:41.060 --> 55:42.250
Where is it?

55:42.300 --> 55:46.370
I was sure that he was going
to change the world in some way.

55:46.420 --> 55:50.020
I just didn't tell him
how dangerous it would be.

55:50.580 --> 55:55.130
But those systems of oppression
never hold, never last,

55:55.180 --> 55:59.540
never survive, for we
will not live in fear.
