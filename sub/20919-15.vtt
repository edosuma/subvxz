00:11.487 --> 00:13.722
- Nothing here.
- Keep looking.

00:28.504 --> 00:30.471
Hand me your scanner.

00:30.506 --> 00:32.106
Are you even listening to me?

00:32.131 --> 00:33.918
- Huh?
- Hi, my name's Hawkeye.

00:33.953 --> 00:37.345
I would ask you your name,
but, honestly, I don't care.

00:39.382 --> 00:42.484
I think they know we're here.

00:50.193 --> 00:51.960
Heads-up, Captain Marvel.

00:51.995 --> 00:53.495
Gonna go ahead and assume

00:53.496 --> 00:55.496
there's something important
they want in here.

00:55.531 --> 00:57.576
Bizarre energy readings off
the boxes when we came in.

00:57.600 --> 01:00.442
I'm guessing supernatural.

01:00.603 --> 01:04.305
Great. Hydra's trading
high tech for hocus-pocus.

01:04.340 --> 01:07.275
Uh, Falcon, can you move your
head a little to the left?

01:10.830 --> 01:11.972
Huh?

01:12.007 --> 01:15.350
So SHIELD has a secret warehouse
filled with magic wands and stuff?

01:15.385 --> 01:17.485
Yeah, something like that.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.988
- I hate magic.
- Hydra wizards.

01:20.023 --> 01:21.923
That's not a nightmare
waiting to happen.

01:21.958 --> 01:23.025
Huh?

01:24.694 --> 01:29.981
It's not gonna happen.
Not on our watch.

01:42.478 --> 01:44.512
Greetings.

01:44.547 --> 01:48.416
This is the Black Panther.
What is it?

01:48.451 --> 01:50.596
You are correct. I am out of
the kingdom at the moment.

01:50.620 --> 01:53.888
I will send instructions
as soon as I can.

01:53.923 --> 01:56.190
Oh, I'm sorry. Are
we boring you?

01:58.728 --> 02:03.698
- There it is!
- You two, drop the crate!

02:08.838 --> 02:12.658
- The talisman is ours.
- Hail Hydra!

02:23.686 --> 02:27.422
I hate magic!

02:31.597 --> 02:34.412
<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by
f1nc0 ~ Addic7ed.com ~</font> </i>

03:03.389 --> 03:06.190
We need to close that chest!

03:08.394 --> 03:11.496
- Captain Marvel!
- Got it!

03:18.404 --> 03:22.373
Whoa, whoa!

03:22.408 --> 03:26.474
- I got you, Hawkeye.
- They're gone.

03:26.509 --> 03:28.813
They covered their getaway
with that distraction.

03:30.249 --> 03:33.318
Um, if this was a distraction,

03:33.353 --> 03:36.387
then what did Hydra
actually steal?

03:36.422 --> 03:38.389
<i>I don't care what Hydra stole.</i>

03:38.424 --> 03:41.793
<i>Big brother, you promised
me you'd send the files.</i>

03:41.828 --> 03:44.696
<i>I came back from Oxford
early and find our</i>

03:44.697 --> 03:47.565
<i>country in disarray
because you're not here.</i>

03:47.600 --> 03:50.401
<i>You're off fighting a Red Skull...
whatever that is.</i>

03:50.436 --> 03:53.571
Shuri, I am King of Wakanda,

03:53.606 --> 03:56.240
but I have responsibilities
to the Avengers as well.

03:56.275 --> 04:00.611
<i>And what should Wakanda do while
you run around playing superhero?</i>

04:00.646 --> 04:04.115
<i>No one can do everything.
Not even you.</i>

04:04.150 --> 04:06.484
<i>If you would just
give me authority,</i>

04:06.519 --> 04:09.420
<i>I could handle things
here while you...</i>

04:09.455 --> 04:12.090
I understand our
country needs me.

04:12.125 --> 04:15.526
I will make sure to give it my
full attention when I get back.

04:15.561 --> 04:17.528
Come on. We have
a lead on Hydra.

04:17.563 --> 04:19.262
<i>See? This is what
I'm talking about.</i>

04:19.298 --> 04:21.499
<i>How can you do anything here</i>

04:21.534 --> 04:23.868
<i>when there's always another
emergency to take care of?</i>

04:23.903 --> 04:28.639
- I must go now. Say hi to everyone for me.
- What? T'Challa!

04:28.674 --> 04:33.811
Is everything... Okay then.

04:33.846 --> 04:36.014
We dug through the
confiscated gear.

04:36.049 --> 04:38.150
Turns out one of the
Hydra dummies used their

04:38.151 --> 04:40.252
communicator to take
pictures of his food.

04:40.253 --> 04:43.945
- We were able to extract GPS locations.
- These are the potential

04:43.980 --> 04:46.057
hideouts where Hydra
could've taken the artifact.

04:46.092 --> 04:48.459
Do we know what it was they
took from the warehouse?

04:48.494 --> 04:50.728
Nope. Thanks to Hurricane Hydra,

04:50.763 --> 04:53.464
they're having a hard time
cataloging all the artifacts.

04:53.499 --> 04:55.333
They don't know yet
what got taken.

04:55.368 --> 04:57.468
Whatever it was, it
was something magic.

04:57.503 --> 05:01.707
- Have I mentioned that I hate...
- Yes. You have.

05:01.708 --> 05:03.141
Several times.

05:03.176 --> 05:05.143
We'll split into teams
to cover more ground.

05:05.178 --> 05:08.579
Captain Marvel, you're with Falcon.
Hawkeye, with Ant-Man.

05:08.614 --> 05:12.583
- Black Panther, you're with me.
- I will be fine on my own.

05:12.618 --> 05:15.420
And you'll even be
better with backup.

05:21.727 --> 05:23.539
<i>I couldn't help overhearing
your conversation.</i>

05:23.563 --> 05:26.597
I appreciate the concern,
Captain America,

05:26.632 --> 05:29.400
but as King of Wakanda,
there are demands on me.

05:29.435 --> 05:31.402
I do not expect you
to understand.

05:31.437 --> 05:33.204
I don't know much
about being a king,

05:33.239 --> 05:35.440
but I know a little bit
about being a symbol.

05:35.475 --> 05:38.009
Sometimes people can forget
there's just a guy in there.

05:38.044 --> 05:40.611
And as impressive a guy
as you are, Panther,

05:40.646 --> 05:42.847
you can't be in two
places at once.

05:42.882 --> 05:47.051
- Your sister has a point.
- She has valid concerns.

05:47.086 --> 05:50.054
But the good of Wakanda
is my responsibility.

05:50.089 --> 05:55.340
I cannot force my burden on another.
Especially my baby sister.

05:55.928 --> 05:59.430
<i>We are here. Hong Kong.</i>

05:59.465 --> 06:04.268
<i>We are approaching our destination.
The building is heavily fortified.</i>

06:04.303 --> 06:06.104
Sensors and weapons
on every floor.

06:06.139 --> 06:08.239
Sounds like a Hydra base to me.

06:09.742 --> 06:13.744
Your jet's camouflaged. Wouldn't
it be easier just to land?

06:13.779 --> 06:16.181
It could hover.

06:18.778 --> 06:21.431
But where is the fun in that?

06:22.588 --> 06:26.925
This is definitely a Hydra base.
But why is it so empty?

06:30.796 --> 06:33.081
Hold on, Captain America!

07:04.864 --> 07:06.597
More fun than running
a country, huh?

07:06.632 --> 07:11.236
- This is not fun. It is duty.
- Right.

07:15.626 --> 07:17.879
Not now.

07:25.151 --> 07:27.118
Captain America, your shield!

07:31.591 --> 07:34.825
Was that your sister
calling again?

07:34.860 --> 07:38.496
She will be most upset when
she reaches my voice mail.

07:41.067 --> 07:43.101
_

07:48.507 --> 07:50.841
An unusual-looking Hydra agent.

07:50.876 --> 07:54.626
Baron Mordo, master
of dark magic.

07:54.661 --> 07:57.150
He's known to take on
contract work for Hydra.

07:57.185 --> 08:00.124
Black Panther and
Captain America.

08:01.754 --> 08:05.756
You've come to pay respects
to the Talisman of Kaluu?

08:05.791 --> 08:09.594
Alas, I was not
expecting guests.

08:09.629 --> 08:11.596
We didn't mean to
crash your party.

08:11.631 --> 08:14.865
Oh, but I am the only one here.

08:14.900 --> 08:20.465
It's not really a party until...
there are more guests.

08:33.259 --> 08:37.328
Mindless ones, I command thee.

08:37.363 --> 08:39.864
Destroy the Avengers!

09:31.116 --> 09:33.083
We won't last long
if they keep coming.

09:33.118 --> 09:36.320
Ignore them. Go for Baron Mordo!

09:38.824 --> 09:42.960
The talisman will usher in
a new era of dark magic...

09:45.197 --> 09:47.898
an era ruled by me.

09:47.933 --> 09:51.101
Pity you won't be
alive to witness it.

09:51.136 --> 09:54.271
_

09:56.008 --> 09:57.608
Incoming magic!

10:10.322 --> 10:12.690
I told you my jet could hover.

10:12.725 --> 10:16.360
Good thing, too. He's gone.

10:16.395 --> 10:19.497
<i>Baron Mordo's magic leaves
a distinct signature.</i>

10:19.532 --> 10:22.299
It should lead us to him
and the stolen talisman.

10:22.334 --> 10:25.703
Still amazes me that Wakandan
tech can track magic.

10:25.738 --> 10:28.639
Magic is just science we
do not understand yet.

10:28.674 --> 10:31.442
<i>That doesn't make Hawkeye
hate it any less,</i>

10:31.477 --> 10:33.370
<i>or me trust it.</i>

10:34.547 --> 10:37.014
Scanners are showing an
area below the island.

10:37.049 --> 10:40.218
That is where we will
find Baron Mordo.

10:44.256 --> 10:47.858
Hmm. If I was Baron Mordo
with all that dark magic,

10:47.893 --> 10:50.428
I wouldn't hide behind a door.

10:51.897 --> 10:53.998
I would hide behind an illusion.

11:01.574 --> 11:03.207
We are being followed.

11:05.344 --> 11:10.147
- Shuri!
- No one sends me to voice mail.

11:10.182 --> 11:12.917
What are you doing here?
And how did you find me?

11:12.952 --> 11:15.603
You aren't the only one
who knows how to use

11:15.604 --> 11:18.255
- Wakandan tech, big brother.
- Go home.

11:18.290 --> 11:20.424
This is not the
time or the place.

11:20.459 --> 11:22.426
What about your place?

11:22.461 --> 11:24.862
You should be in
Wakanda being king,

11:24.897 --> 11:27.231
not running around
playing superhero.

11:27.266 --> 11:30.768
If you're staying, I'm staying...
Your Majesty.

11:31.971 --> 11:36.440
Apologies, Captain America.
Allow me to introduce Shuri.

11:36.475 --> 11:39.176
Multiple PhDs in science
and philosophy,

11:39.211 --> 11:42.112
expert statesman, a
respected academic,

11:42.147 --> 11:44.381
leader in Wakandan
technology advancement...

11:44.416 --> 11:46.763
- It's an honor...
- head of the Wakandan School

11:46.837 --> 11:49.908
of Alternative Studies,
Princess of Wakanda, and...

11:49.909 --> 11:53.420
- my little baby sister.
- It's an honor to meet you.

11:53.455 --> 11:55.092
Your brother hasn't
mentioned you before,

11:55.127 --> 11:57.728
but then... he
doesn't talk much.

11:57.763 --> 12:01.532
Oh? We thought he just
acted that way in Wakanda.

12:01.567 --> 12:04.635
We need to find Baron
Mordo and the talisman.

12:04.670 --> 12:06.804
Do not get in our way.

12:08.641 --> 12:12.109
You tracked us all the way here.
That's pretty impressive.

12:12.144 --> 12:15.613
My brother, T'Challa, isn't as
stealthy as he thinks he is.

12:15.648 --> 12:19.249
- Well, he's clearly very proud of you.
- No, he's not.

12:19.284 --> 12:21.885
No matter how many degrees
and awards I earn,

12:21.920 --> 12:26.890
- he only ever sees me as his baby sister.
- Careful.

12:28.293 --> 12:30.661
This is surely not
the only trap.

12:30.696 --> 12:34.064
We must be cautious.
Stay behind me.

12:34.099 --> 12:36.100
I have a better solution.

12:41.140 --> 12:43.341
The latest in
Wakandan technology.

12:46.345 --> 12:50.314
Honestly, big brother, if all of your
Avengers missions are this easy,

12:50.349 --> 12:53.283
you should've made it back
to Wakanda weeks ago.

12:53.318 --> 12:57.121
A fancy bracelet is no
substitute for experience.

12:57.156 --> 13:00.124
You're only saying that
because you don't have one.

13:00.159 --> 13:02.660
I can definitely see the
family resemblance.

13:02.695 --> 13:06.030
Why does she not listen? She is
going to get herself killed.

13:06.065 --> 13:08.198
<i>Found another one!</i>

13:08.233 --> 13:10.300
I somehow doubt that.

13:25.684 --> 13:31.055
- The energy readings are highest here.
- Well, I should hope so.

13:31.090 --> 13:34.158
Welcome to my inner sanctum.

13:34.193 --> 13:36.794
We didn't want to keep you
waiting, Baron Mordo.

13:36.829 --> 13:42.576
On the contrary. You're just in
time to witness the main event.

13:55.214 --> 13:59.016
I have fully unlocked
the Talisman of Kaluu,

13:59.051 --> 14:01.018
allowing me to tap into energies

14:01.053 --> 14:04.088
across all dimensions
of light and darkness.

14:04.123 --> 14:08.058
In my hands, it will
do wonderful things.

14:08.093 --> 14:11.195
Wonderful, terrible things.

14:18.971 --> 14:21.205
But why tell you about its power

14:21.240 --> 14:24.775
when I can demonstrate?

14:35.220 --> 14:39.123
I am the master of
dark magic unlea...

14:55.007 --> 14:56.507
Shuri!

15:00.445 --> 15:04.540
I wonder... what would you be

15:04.575 --> 15:07.251
without that legendary
strength and agility?

15:07.286 --> 15:10.085
Black Panther!

15:10.255 --> 15:13.123
Captain!

15:16.328 --> 15:17.928
Oh, no!

15:27.539 --> 15:29.940
Baron Mordo,

15:29.975 --> 15:33.144
the most powerful dark
magician in the universe.

15:42.054 --> 15:46.484
And now I have the
body to match.

15:53.638 --> 15:56.440
Not nearly as impressive
without this body,

15:56.475 --> 15:58.608
are you, Captain America?

15:58.643 --> 16:01.445
Baron Mordo drained the
strength right out of him.

16:14.159 --> 16:17.160
I am sorry, Captain.
This is my fault.

16:17.195 --> 16:18.812
I think it's safe to go ahead

16:18.813 --> 16:22.432
and blame the guy with the
staff, and my muscles.

16:22.467 --> 16:26.220
Shuri, stay with
Captain America.

16:26.405 --> 16:28.372
Mordo is mine.

16:28.407 --> 16:31.008
I could wipe you off
the face of the planet

16:31.043 --> 16:34.311
with a bare touch
of my dark magic.

16:34.346 --> 16:36.680
But I have this new body.

16:36.715 --> 16:39.649
I should give it a
good, thorough test.

16:39.684 --> 16:43.353
The only thing you'll be getting
is a good, thorough thrashing!

16:57.869 --> 17:01.671
Some people spend a lifetime
to gain a body like this.

17:01.706 --> 17:04.473
I merely had to steal it.

17:04.509 --> 17:07.877
- Much nicer.
- You hit my brother.

17:07.913 --> 17:10.680
Nobody hits my
brother except me!

17:10.714 --> 17:13.050
You'll share his fate!

17:18.690 --> 17:22.692
- Up and at 'em, soldier.
- Baron Mordo's too strong.

17:22.727 --> 17:25.228
I'm not sure how I can stop him.

17:25.262 --> 17:28.893
You can't defeat him.
But we can.

17:47.719 --> 17:49.637
- Shuri...
- No, I'm not going to let

17:49.638 --> 17:53.215
- you fight him yourself.
- That is good,

17:53.250 --> 17:55.570
because I need you to figure out
a way to stop the talisman.

17:55.594 --> 17:57.561
How am I supposed to do that?

17:57.596 --> 18:01.634
If anyone can do it, you can.

18:06.571 --> 18:10.607
Pathetic. Why even try
to fight, Captain?

18:12.444 --> 18:15.412
Your strength belongs to me.

18:15.447 --> 18:17.614
It's not about
having the muscles.

18:17.649 --> 18:20.845
It's about knowing
how to use them.

18:24.189 --> 18:27.390
Pull up all research materials
on magical energies,

18:27.425 --> 18:30.594
magical frequencies, and the
science behind sorcery.

18:30.629 --> 18:34.330
Only the hard stuff. None
of that easy beginner junk.

18:34.365 --> 18:37.573
Enough!

18:39.538 --> 18:42.005
You Avengers may be
able to take a punch,

18:42.040 --> 18:45.642
but no one can withstand
the full fury

18:45.677 --> 18:49.772
of the dimensions of
light and darkness!

18:59.958 --> 19:01.492
Come on.

19:04.296 --> 19:06.129
By the Vishanti,

19:06.164 --> 19:10.234
your time on this plane
of existence is over!

19:13.538 --> 19:15.739
Huh?

19:18.009 --> 19:21.778
- What?
- Pretty great, right?

19:21.813 --> 19:25.382
I hacked into the talisman
and rewrote the code.

19:25.417 --> 19:27.651
See, all magic is,

19:27.686 --> 19:30.654
is just science we don't
understand yet...

19:30.743 --> 19:33.123
- until we do.
- Huh?

19:33.158 --> 19:34.958
Impossible!

19:36.761 --> 19:41.631
This is for trying to end
our time on the plane of...

19:41.666 --> 19:43.700
whatever.

19:56.581 --> 20:01.051
By the power of Kaluu!
What have you done?

20:01.086 --> 20:03.019
No!

20:03.054 --> 20:04.988
Not like this.

20:05.023 --> 20:07.794
Not like this!

20:17.435 --> 20:19.669
It's good to be back.

20:19.704 --> 20:22.205
I could not defeat
Baron Mordo myself.

20:22.240 --> 20:25.775
No man can do everything alone.
You were right.

20:25.810 --> 20:29.046
Did King T'Challa, the mighty
Black Panther and know-it-all

20:29.047 --> 20:32.282
big brother, just admit
that his sister was right?

20:32.317 --> 20:35.285
And next, you'll tell me you're
coming home to rule Wakanda.

20:35.320 --> 20:39.022
No. I am not coming home.
I am not needed.

20:39.057 --> 20:41.024
You have more than
proven yourself capable

20:41.059 --> 20:45.462
- of making decisions in my absence.
- You're serious?

20:45.497 --> 20:47.864
I don't have to wait around for
you to approve everything?

20:47.899 --> 20:49.866
I cannot do it all.

20:49.901 --> 20:52.035
Now I see that I do not have to.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.808
And I can see that the
world needs Black Panther.

20:58.843 --> 21:01.444
I'll take care of Wakanda.
I'll leave the magic,

21:01.479 --> 21:05.249
sorcery, and
supervillains to you.

21:07.519 --> 21:11.221
<i>This isn't over!</i>

21:19.197 --> 21:21.331
I need your help.

21:21.366 --> 21:24.968
You must take me to
the one called...

21:25.003 --> 21:27.004
Doctor Strange.

21:37.134 --> 21:40.703
