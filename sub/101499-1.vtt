WEBVTT

00:11.243 --> 00:12.211
You don't,

00:12.243 --> 00:13.612
you don't have enough fun.

00:13.646 --> 00:14.547
You know?

00:14.580 --> 00:15.480
I have fun.

00:15.513 --> 00:16.782
I mean, real fun.

00:16.815 --> 00:17.783
The kind of fun where
you're just like

00:17.817 --> 00:19.085
lovin' what you're doin'

00:19.117 --> 00:20.552
and you're not givin' a fuck

00:20.585 --> 00:21.753
about anything else.

00:21.786 --> 00:22.754
I always give
a fuck about everything else.

00:22.788 --> 00:24.457
Mm-hm.

00:24.489 --> 00:25.457
Yeah.

00:25.490 --> 00:26.458
That's your problem.

00:26.492 --> 00:27.460
Come on.

00:28.661 --> 00:29.562
You would love
letting yourself go.

00:29.594 --> 00:30.495
I'd have to read a manual

00:30.528 --> 00:31.496
on how to do that first.

00:37.402 --> 00:38.204
What is that?

00:38.237 --> 00:39.105
It's Oxy.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.245
What does it do?

00:46.277 --> 00:47.679
It makes all your worries

00:47.713 --> 00:49.481
and all your problems just...

00:49.515 --> 00:50.549
disappear.

00:51.783 --> 00:52.717
It got me through last season

00:52.750 --> 00:53.552
when I had that torn hamstring.

00:53.585 --> 00:54.420
You remember that?

00:54.453 --> 00:55.254
Yeah.

00:55.286 --> 00:56.088
Mm-hm.

00:56.755 --> 00:57.590
Best ride of your life.

00:57.622 --> 00:58.590
I guarantee.

01:08.733 --> 01:09.734
Okay.

01:12.537 --> 01:14.506
You're not so boring after all.

01:22.447 --> 01:23.682
Watch your step.

01:24.683 --> 01:25.651
Watch your step.

01:26.685 --> 01:27.653
Careful, watch your step.

01:27.686 --> 01:28.654
Watch your step.

01:28.686 --> 01:29.888
Tell them how you're spending

01:29.921 --> 01:31.224
your Saturdays, Kristen.

01:31.257 --> 01:31.858
Hannah, shut up!

01:31.891 --> 01:33.559
How?

01:33.591 --> 01:34.527
Oh my God.

01:34.560 --> 01:35.760
Your mom enrolled you
in another flute class.

01:35.793 --> 01:36.596
Didn't she?

01:37.662 --> 01:38.597
It's worse!

01:38.631 --> 01:39.632
What the hell

01:39.665 --> 01:40.633
could be worse than...

01:40.665 --> 01:42.468
It's an SAT prep course

01:42.501 --> 01:43.769
with Valerie the bitch!

01:43.802 --> 01:44.770
Oh my god!

01:44.802 --> 01:45.605
Oh my god!

01:45.638 --> 01:46.639
Are you joking?

01:46.671 --> 01:48.640
You're in AP calculus.

01:48.674 --> 01:51.577
You shouldn't need a
stupid SAT prep course.

01:51.609 --> 01:53.712
You can get in just
about anywhere you want...

01:53.745 --> 01:55.414
That's what I tell her.

01:55.447 --> 01:56.615
My mom thinks I can
get into Princeton so I...

01:56.649 --> 01:57.650
You can!

01:57.683 --> 01:58.484
Definitely can.

01:58.516 --> 01:59.551
Boring!

01:59.584 --> 02:00.819
I'm following my
boo to Penn State.

02:02.287 --> 02:03.655
Yeah, Jeffrey parties nonstop

02:03.688 --> 02:05.190
and he still has a two two.

02:05.224 --> 02:06.392
What is a two two?

02:06.424 --> 02:07.659
Whatever, you and
your AP calculus

02:07.692 --> 02:09.328
will be at lame-ass
Princeton in Boston.

02:09.360 --> 02:10.362
What?

02:10.395 --> 02:11.363
Hannah?

02:11.396 --> 02:12.465
It's New Jersey!

02:12.497 --> 02:13.298
No, is she joking?

02:13.966 --> 02:14.867
Are you actually joking?

02:14.900 --> 02:16.301
It's Princeton New Jersey,

02:16.335 --> 02:17.637
Princeton is in
New Jersey Hannah!

02:17.669 --> 02:19.237
I'm gonna have
to fact check this.

02:21.774 --> 02:22.574
Whatever!

02:22.608 --> 02:23.408
Whatever.

02:24.676 --> 02:26.179
What are we gettin'
into tonight bitches?

02:26.211 --> 02:27.479
Party!

03:14.460 --> 03:16.629
What you

03:16.662 --> 03:17.930
Whatchu gon' do with it?

03:23.335 --> 03:24.937
Whatchu gon' do with it?

03:24.969 --> 03:26.639
Whatchu gon' do with it?

03:31.676 --> 03:34.013
Whatchu gon' do with it?

03:34.045 --> 03:36.816
Whatchu gon' do with it?

03:55.800 --> 03:58.370
Oh, that feels like my boo!

03:59.837 --> 04:00.772
There's a snowing forecast,

04:00.806 --> 04:03.409
for all good lil sno-babies.

04:04.075 --> 04:04.876
Yes.

04:04.909 --> 04:06.044
Thank you baby!

04:09.615 --> 04:10.750
Oh, Hannah, Kristen,

04:10.782 --> 04:11.616
This is my boy Mike Stelini.

04:11.651 --> 04:13.886
Mike's our head
runnin' back this year.

04:13.919 --> 04:14.954
Hi Mike.

04:14.986 --> 04:16.721
I know who you are.

04:17.790 --> 04:18.724
Guessing you are,

04:18.757 --> 04:19.625
you Irish?

04:20.759 --> 04:22.395
Kristen...

04:22.427 --> 04:23.862
McBride?

04:23.896 --> 04:24.730
McDougle?

04:25.730 --> 04:27.500
I'm gonna get it.

04:27.533 --> 04:28.367
Monihan?

04:30.401 --> 04:31.670
McKusker.

04:31.704 --> 04:32.672
I knew it...

04:32.704 --> 04:33.605
Kristen McKusker.

04:33.639 --> 04:34.874
Knew it why did you stop me.

04:36.007 --> 04:37.476
I'll be honest.

04:38.644 --> 04:40.646
I've been wanting
to do something

04:40.678 --> 04:41.646
since I saw you ten minutes ago.

04:41.680 --> 04:42.581

How does she not fall?

06:30.055 --> 06:31.723
Aw.

06:31.757 --> 06:32.824
Emily's dancin' to a Chris
Brown song in her head.

06:34.026 --> 06:34.994
You are drunk.

06:35.860 --> 06:36.695
Bye!

06:37.995 --> 06:41.500
Why'd you say she
was white trash?

06:41.533 --> 06:43.134
'Cause she comes from
a white trash family.

06:43.168 --> 06:44.170
Yeah.

06:44.202 --> 06:45.503
Mm=hm.

06:45.536 --> 06:46.838
Her sister got pregnant
when she was 15

06:46.872 --> 06:49.108
dropped out of school
and had the baby.

06:49.141 --> 06:50.543
Can you believe that?

06:50.576 --> 06:52.711
She actually had the baby.

06:52.744 --> 06:54.013
That's crazy.

06:54.045 --> 06:55.447
They're like, so ghetto.

06:56.814 --> 06:57.949
Blur her face if
you post that shit.

07:16.668 --> 07:19.672
You know, your room
hasn't really changed

07:19.704 --> 07:20.906
since your mom left.

07:20.939 --> 07:23.542
what's up with that?

07:28.514 --> 07:31.617
Die Hard Nine's
potent, Kristen.

07:31.649 --> 07:33.718
So open wide

07:33.752 --> 07:35.254
and be prepared.

08:13.091 --> 08:14.627
Come on!

08:16.127 --> 08:17.062
Don't be scared.

08:17.995 --> 08:19.031
Okay.

08:22.199 --> 08:23.235
Don't move.

08:24.769 --> 08:25.937
The vain

08:25.971 --> 08:26.771
is right

08:28.173 --> 08:29.841
there.

08:55.033 --> 08:57.068
Tiny puked again.

08:57.101 --> 08:59.137
You're freakin' kidding me!

09:12.049 --> 09:13.217
He is so disgusting.

09:13.250 --> 09:14.752
Ugh.

09:14.785 --> 09:16.588
Asshole never lasts past ten.

09:47.284 --> 09:48.386
Where were you?

09:50.889 --> 09:52.091
You weren't with her, were you?

09:55.126 --> 09:56.094
Wait.

11:02.126 --> 11:03.161

12:56.374 --> 12:59.444
Are you going to pay any

13:03.347 --> 13:05.317
So the Reynolds
brothers called again.

13:05.350 --> 13:06.552
Oh yeah?

13:06.585 --> 13:08.019
Mm-hm.

13:08.052 --> 13:09.187
What're you talkin'
to those assholes for?

13:09.221 --> 13:10.455
They're serious about
buying this place.

13:11.423 --> 13:12.857
Look, I know dad's dream

13:12.890 --> 13:14.458
was to have us carry
out what he started,

13:14.491 --> 13:15.593
but now that we own this place,

13:15.626 --> 13:17.261
that dream's a nightmare, Matt.

13:17.294 --> 13:20.198
This place is
hemorrhaging money.

13:26.504 --> 13:29.140
I made a promise, Mary.

13:32.543 --> 13:33.946
I think we just
need to consider

13:33.979 --> 13:34.879
the Reynolds brothers' offer...

13:38.182 --> 13:39.585
Thanks.

13:52.663 --> 13:53.865
Kristen!

13:53.899 --> 13:54.866
Where is it?

14:05.576 --> 14:07.312
You know, if you
touch my iPad again,

14:07.345 --> 14:09.348
you're not going to make
it to your 10th birthday.

14:10.414 --> 14:12.450
You are so gross.

14:13.618 --> 14:14.586
The check was on the counter.

14:14.619 --> 14:16.254
Where did you put it Kristen?

14:16.288 --> 14:17.188
Can't believe you're making
me do this on a Saturday.

14:17.221 --> 14:18.423
You need to raise your score

14:18.456 --> 14:20.459
another 300 points to
get into Princeton.

14:20.491 --> 14:21.926
I'll get up 300.

14:21.960 --> 14:23.562
The fine print in life

14:23.595 --> 14:24.963
applies to you,
Kristen McKusker.

14:24.995 --> 14:25.963
When are you gonna realize that?

14:25.996 --> 14:27.431
When it's too late?

14:27.465 --> 14:29.334
You're not going to
make today's game, daddy?

14:29.366 --> 14:30.368
Client, sweetie.

14:30.402 --> 14:31.603
I wish I could,

14:31.635 --> 14:35.339
but I will be back for
the game on Tuesday.

14:35.373 --> 14:36.208
How much

14:37.341 --> 14:38.677
is the SAT course?

14:41.446 --> 14:42.281
Okay.

14:42.313 --> 14:43.414
Honey.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.317
Who put this in here?

14:45.350 --> 14:46.350
Maddie.

14:47.418 --> 14:48.319
Hurry up, Maddie.

14:48.352 --> 14:49.053
We have got to get going.

14:49.086 --> 14:49.687
Let's go.

14:49.721 --> 14:51.123
Bill.

14:51.155 --> 14:52.156
I'll drop you off
at the airport.

14:52.191 --> 14:54.059
Then I'll drop off Maddie
at the soccer game.

14:54.091 --> 14:54.992
Then I'll drop off Kristen
at Valerie's apartment.

14:55.025 --> 14:56.227
Then I had got to swing by

14:56.260 --> 14:57.495
the office to pick
up the brochures

14:57.528 --> 14:58.463
for the angel road listing.

14:58.496 --> 15:00.298
Then I'll get Maddie
after her soccer game.

15:00.331 --> 15:01.265
We'll scoop you up, Kristen,

15:01.298 --> 15:02.333
bring you both back home.

15:03.634 --> 15:04.436
I'm going to be showing houses

15:04.469 --> 15:05.337
for the rest of the day.

15:05.370 --> 15:06.437
You got Maddie.

15:07.405 --> 15:08.205
That sounds like a
nice little Saturday.

15:09.506 --> 15:11.175
Promise you'll make
Tuesday's game, daddy?

15:11.208 --> 15:12.343
Absolutely.

15:13.410 --> 15:14.612
You know what mom?

15:14.645 --> 15:16.014
I'll just have Hannah
take me to Valerie's

15:16.047 --> 15:17.449
and then you can stay
at Maddie's game.

15:18.716 --> 15:19.518
Sure?

15:19.551 --> 15:20.953
Yeah!

15:20.985 --> 15:21.687
You're gonna stay and
watch me play, mommy?

15:21.720 --> 15:22.586
You sure Hannah can take you?

15:22.620 --> 15:24.022
Yes.

15:24.054 --> 15:25.456
And then she'll drop
me back off here.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.392
Thanks Kiki.

15:27.424 --> 15:28.526
You better not
slack, Little Bit.

15:30.562 --> 15:32.730
Come on Maddie.

15:32.764 --> 15:33.666
Here we go.

15:37.168 --> 15:38.070
Kristen.

15:38.102 --> 15:39.570
You didn't do any of the work

15:39.604 --> 15:42.040
I emailed you last
night, did ya?

15:42.072 --> 15:45.244
You want to get
accepted at Princeton?

15:46.644 --> 15:48.245
I guess.

15:49.279 --> 15:50.247
You guess?

15:50.280 --> 15:51.248
You either do or you don't.

15:51.282 --> 15:52.283
We don't have the time

15:52.317 --> 15:54.352
and I am not in the mood.

15:55.386 --> 15:56.354
Okay, okay.

15:56.388 --> 15:57.489
Yeah.

15:57.522 --> 16:00.592
I do want to get
accepted into Princeton.

16:01.493 --> 16:02.728
Geez, Valerie.

16:02.760 --> 16:05.163
Your hormones are raging today.

16:05.196 --> 16:06.665
Remind me to never get pregnant.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.168
When you due?

16:10.201 --> 16:11.570
Not soon enough.

16:13.238 --> 16:16.575
I want the world to
meet my baby Sophia.

16:20.577 --> 16:21.545
Baby baby!

16:21.578 --> 16:23.080
Hi.

16:23.114 --> 16:24.081
Talk to me, baby.

16:24.115 --> 16:25.082
So.

16:25.115 --> 16:27.519
My personal fertility doctor,

16:27.552 --> 16:31.523
WebMD, says that I need to
track my biophasic pattern.

16:31.556 --> 16:33.557
Oh, what the hell is that?

16:33.591 --> 16:35.659
It means I take my
temperature a bunch

16:35.692 --> 16:37.528
to estimate when I'm ovulating.

16:37.562 --> 16:38.629
And?

16:38.663 --> 16:40.065
The good news is

16:40.097 --> 16:42.033
my peak ovulation
is tomorrow at noon.

16:42.067 --> 16:43.567
And there's bad news?

16:43.600 --> 16:44.503
Yeah.

16:44.535 --> 16:45.603
Brandon won't give me off

16:45.636 --> 16:46.771
and Lisa's out with the flu

16:46.804 --> 16:48.472
and the new girl's a ditz.

16:48.505 --> 16:49.774
Well, I'll just have
to come down there

16:49.807 --> 16:51.242
and knock you up in the kitchen.

16:51.275 --> 16:52.543
Behind the pizza boxes.

16:53.778 --> 16:55.747
Sorry, pepperoni pizza lovers.

16:55.779 --> 16:57.548
You'll have to get
your slices to go

16:57.581 --> 17:00.085
because your desperate,
barren waitress

17:00.118 --> 17:02.521
is making another futile
attempt to get pregnant.

17:02.553 --> 17:04.623
You're not desperate, Anna.

17:07.558 --> 17:09.493
Okay, baby.

17:09.527 --> 17:10.429
I gotta go.

17:11.628 --> 17:13.564
You know I can't be late.

17:13.597 --> 17:15.332
Brandon's on a war path.

17:15.365 --> 17:16.567
Yeah?

17:16.601 --> 17:19.404
Well you tell that
Dallas-Cowboys-loving Irish pizza maker

17:19.436 --> 17:21.605
I'll come down there
and stuff his ass

17:21.638 --> 17:22.840
into a sausage grinder.

17:22.874 --> 17:23.708
Huh?

17:23.740 --> 17:24.542
Okay.

17:25.643 --> 17:26.778
Go Eagles.

17:26.810 --> 17:27.778
Damn right.

17:27.811 --> 17:29.713
Eagles, baby.

17:29.747 --> 17:31.416
I love you.

17:31.449 --> 17:33.185
I love you more.

17:38.589 --> 17:39.790
Oh!

17:39.824 --> 17:40.725
I have something
funny to tell you.

17:40.758 --> 17:41.660
Please tell.

17:41.692 --> 17:44.128
Cruella de Vil is pregnant.

17:44.162 --> 17:45.230
You're lying.

17:45.262 --> 17:46.230
Nope.

17:46.263 --> 17:47.164
Oh my God.

17:47.198 --> 17:48.400
They've known for two months.

17:48.432 --> 17:50.402
Dude, the bitch
isn't even showing

17:50.434 --> 17:51.435
and she's wearing
maternity clothes.

17:51.469 --> 17:52.437
So typical.

17:52.470 --> 17:53.572
Yeah.

17:53.605 --> 17:54.506
She insists on traveling
with my dad now

17:54.538 --> 17:55.673
to all his business trips.

17:55.707 --> 17:56.708
So.

17:56.740 --> 17:59.310
They're never home.

17:59.344 --> 18:01.113
You should see my dad.

18:02.180 --> 18:02.781
All happy.

18:02.814 --> 18:03.748
Rubbing her belly,

18:03.780 --> 18:05.383
feeding her tapioca pudding.

18:06.317 --> 18:07.118
Ew.

18:07.152 --> 18:08.220
So gross.

18:08.252 --> 18:09.487
They're picking Irish names,

18:09.520 --> 18:10.489
Connor for a boy.

18:10.521 --> 18:12.223
Delaney for a girl.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.692
Those are the worst names

18:14.726 --> 18:15.727
I have ever heard.

18:15.759 --> 18:17.162
I know.

18:17.194 --> 18:19.730
How's your mom
handling the baby?

18:19.763 --> 18:21.365
Like usual.

18:21.398 --> 18:23.667
This time his name's Hank.

18:23.701 --> 18:25.903
They're in a threesome.

18:26.770 --> 18:27.571
Oh my God.

18:27.605 --> 18:28.606
You're lying!

18:29.507 --> 18:30.775
With who?

18:30.807 --> 18:32.477
Her, Hank,

18:32.509 --> 18:33.677
and Jack Daniels.

18:33.711 --> 18:35.380
I'm sorry dude.

18:35.413 --> 18:37.582
At least he's so fine.

18:37.615 --> 18:39.317
Actually?

18:39.349 --> 18:41.318
Oh, except for his
gut and hairpiece.

18:42.452 --> 18:45.923
I told my mom that she
should buy him a chin strap.

18:45.957 --> 18:46.792
Gross.

19:28.799 --> 19:29.600
Kiki!

19:29.634 --> 19:30.634
I scored a goal!

19:31.603 --> 19:32.403
Mom has the video on her phone!

19:32.436 --> 19:35.173
Can't you knock,
you little brat?

19:37.808 --> 19:39.677
Why are you bleeding?

20:03.867 --> 20:05.903
What, what's it this time?

20:08.940 --> 20:10.808
A vampire was chasing me.

20:10.842 --> 20:12.310
Oh my gosh!

20:20.484 --> 20:21.919
It was scary, Kiki.

20:23.755 --> 20:26.291
Well there's no
reason to be scared

20:26.324 --> 20:28.759
because Kiki would never

20:28.792 --> 20:29.994
let a vampire chase you.

20:37.734 --> 20:38.702
On the day before,

20:38.736 --> 20:39.738
he was to suffer.

20:39.770 --> 20:40.704
He took bread

20:40.738 --> 20:42.974
in his holy and venerable hands

20:43.007 --> 20:45.744
with his eyes raised to heaven.

20:45.777 --> 20:47.711
To you, oh God.

20:47.744 --> 20:48.846
Almighty father.

20:49.980 --> 20:51.549
Giving you thanks

20:52.650 --> 20:53.718
saying the blessing.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.287
He broke the bread

20:55.319 --> 20:57.955
and he gave it to
his disciples saying

20:57.989 --> 20:59.824
take this all of you,

20:59.856 --> 21:00.959
and eat of it

21:00.991 --> 21:02.726
for this is my body,

21:02.759 --> 21:05.730
which will be given up for you.

21:07.999 --> 21:09.000
In a similar way,

21:09.032 --> 21:10.032
when supper was ended,

21:10.034 --> 21:11.336
he took this precious chalice,

21:11.368 --> 21:13.672
in his holy and venerable hands.

21:13.704 --> 21:15.339
And once more,
giving you thanks,

21:15.373 --> 21:17.308
he said the blessing.

21:17.342 --> 21:18.843
And gave the chalice
to his disciples.

21:18.875 --> 21:21.779
Saying take this, all of you.

Hi!

23:15.727 --> 23:17.896
I'm Clare McKusker,
Banatee Realty.

23:17.929 --> 23:18.897
Matt.

23:18.930 --> 23:19.931
Matt, nice to meet you.

23:19.963 --> 23:20.764
Anna.

23:20.798 --> 23:21.732
Hi Anna.

23:21.766 --> 23:22.667
Thank you guys for calling.

23:22.700 --> 23:23.867
You're going to love this house.

23:23.901 --> 23:25.068
Great school district.

23:25.102 --> 23:26.504
Beautiful neighborhood.

23:26.537 --> 23:27.739
Ready to see it?

23:27.771 --> 23:28.639
Yeah.

23:28.673 --> 23:29.840
Alright, come on in.

23:31.875 --> 23:33.010
This is one of the first houses

23:33.044 --> 23:34.179
built by the Reynolds Brothers.

23:36.614 --> 23:37.949
Nice area.

23:54.598 --> 23:55.433
Matty?

23:56.800 --> 23:58.168
I love the house!

23:59.670 --> 24:00.572
It's perfect.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.507
We can build our life there.

24:02.539 --> 24:03.942
I know you love it, Anna.

24:03.974 --> 24:05.976
And I know it's perfect.

24:07.979 --> 24:10.782
I also know we can't afford it.

24:46.217 --> 24:47.052
Hey.

24:49.586 --> 24:52.223
Doesn't happen
soon, we can adopt.

25:37.867 --> 25:38.702
Kristen.

25:48.078 --> 25:49.713
I'm pregnant.

26:01.157 --> 26:03.193
What's wrong, honey?

26:06.196 --> 26:07.764
When does dad get home?

26:07.798 --> 26:09.366
He's not, he is
golfing with clients

26:09.400 --> 26:10.835
in Hilton Head.

26:12.202 --> 26:13.837
Hey, are you okay?

26:13.871 --> 26:15.774
You don't look so good.

26:19.210 --> 26:20.812
Actually.

26:22.145 --> 26:22.946
I'm sorry.

26:22.980 --> 26:24.082
Hold on.

26:24.115 --> 26:25.048
Hello.

26:28.352 --> 26:32.023
Can we wait until
tomorrow, Gill?

26:32.056 --> 26:33.124
Okay.

26:33.156 --> 26:34.125
Alright.

26:34.157 --> 26:35.826
I'll be right there.

26:39.163 --> 26:41.164
I need to go to the office.

26:41.198 --> 26:42.834
We will talk as
soon as I get back,

26:42.866 --> 26:43.835
I promise.

26:45.102 --> 26:46.004
Okay.

26:49.306 --> 26:50.674
I'll make it quick.

26:58.148 --> 26:59.716
Hey!

26:59.750 --> 27:01.184
There's the hardest working
girl in real estate!

27:01.218 --> 27:02.821
Have a seat, Clare.

27:04.221 --> 27:05.722
So how you doing?

27:05.756 --> 27:06.891
I'm good, how are you, Gill?

27:06.923 --> 27:07.892
Never better, never better.

27:07.924 --> 27:10.127
How are your little guys?

27:10.161 --> 27:11.195
You got two, right?

27:11.228 --> 27:12.363
Yeah, Kristen and Maddie.

27:12.395 --> 27:13.664
They're great.

27:13.698 --> 27:14.332
Thanks!

27:16.366 --> 27:18.068
Clare.

27:18.102 --> 27:20.238
You are being considered for
the relocation listing agent

27:20.270 --> 27:21.071
for this office.

27:21.105 --> 27:22.073
What?

27:23.106 --> 27:24.075
That's amazing!

27:24.107 --> 27:25.076
Yes!

27:25.108 --> 27:26.210
Could be an extra 30,

27:26.242 --> 27:29.146
$35,000 a year in your pocket.

27:29.180 --> 27:30.914
It's between you

27:30.948 --> 27:33.084
and John Delorenzo.

27:33.116 --> 27:34.085
Yeah.

27:34.117 --> 27:35.252
John's aggressive.

27:35.286 --> 27:36.988
Well, my decision
will be based

27:37.020 --> 27:40.124
on who has the best numbers
at the end of this quarter.

27:46.262 --> 27:47.898
Shit.

27:52.202 --> 27:53.437
Hello?

27:53.471 --> 27:54.872
Hi Matt.

27:54.904 --> 27:55.940
Clare McKusker at
Banatee Realty.

27:55.972 --> 27:57.274
I'd like to stop by

27:57.307 --> 27:59.176
and let you know

27:59.210 --> 28:00.411
how you can buy my
angel rose estate

28:00.443 --> 28:01.846
with very little money down.

28:24.234 --> 28:25.202
Hello?

28:25.236 --> 28:26.070
Brandon, hey,

28:26.104 --> 28:29.473
I need to talk to
you about something.

28:31.407 --> 28:32.809
Brandon, I'm...

28:45.221 --> 28:47.224
Yo it's Brandon,
say whatcha gotta say.

30:02.932 --> 30:03.534
Ow!

30:03.567 --> 30:04.434
Fuck.

31:02.926 --> 31:03.627
Matty,

31:03.661 --> 31:05.162
Aveleen reproductive medicine

31:05.194 --> 31:07.999
has an in vitro program
that you can finance.

31:08.031 --> 31:09.399
Finance?

31:09.432 --> 31:10.667
Like a mortgage?

31:10.701 --> 31:12.303
Sort of.

31:12.336 --> 31:13.403
How much?

31:15.204 --> 31:16.941
$14,692.

31:18.107 --> 31:19.277
But you can finance it

31:19.309 --> 31:21.311
over four years.

31:21.345 --> 31:22.512
No interest.

31:22.546 --> 31:24.015
How much are the
monthly payments?

31:24.048 --> 31:24.883
$306.

31:27.351 --> 31:28.619
Babe.

31:28.652 --> 31:30.121
I'll work more shifts...

31:30.153 --> 31:31.221
We can't afford it.

31:31.255 --> 31:32.223
I'll work more shifts.

31:33.490 --> 31:35.960
And is it guaranteed
you'd get pregnant?

31:35.992 --> 31:36.627
No.

31:39.630 --> 31:41.365
Still gotta pay
if it doesn't work?

31:41.397 --> 31:42.500
Yes.

32:05.556 --> 32:06.490
Hey, what are you,

32:06.522 --> 32:07.524
what are you doing here?

32:07.557 --> 32:08.992
It's raining.

32:09.026 --> 32:09.693
I thought I'd pick
you up for change.

32:09.727 --> 32:11.095
Oh my god.

32:11.127 --> 32:12.362
Are dad and Maddie okay?

32:12.395 --> 32:13.364
Yes, yes!

32:13.396 --> 32:14.197
Everyone's fine.

32:14.230 --> 32:15.132
Yes.

32:16.733 --> 32:18.401
I know I've been
distracted with work.

32:18.434 --> 32:20.370
It's been crazy.

32:20.403 --> 32:21.239
And...

32:23.240 --> 32:25.009
Thought I'd check in.

32:30.748 --> 32:32.750
Kristen, are you okay?

32:32.782 --> 32:35.552
'Cause you haven't
been yourself.

32:36.619 --> 32:37.687
Kristen?

32:37.721 --> 32:39.022
Yeah.

32:39.056 --> 32:40.024
Sorry.

32:41.057 --> 32:42.425
I'm fine.

32:42.459 --> 32:44.195
I'm just like tired

32:44.228 --> 32:45.429
and stressed out, you know,

32:45.461 --> 32:46.763
with SATs and whatever.

32:46.797 --> 32:48.365
It's just been like an insane

32:48.398 --> 32:49.466
year for me.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.335
So.

32:51.367 --> 32:52.569
Can I help you?

32:54.270 --> 32:55.172
And whatever it is,

32:55.204 --> 32:56.374
you can talk to me.

32:56.406 --> 32:58.375
Just between me and you.

33:00.443 --> 33:01.444
Kristen.

33:03.079 --> 33:03.681
Mom...

33:06.215 --> 33:07.617
That scared me.

33:08.451 --> 33:10.320
Yeah me too.

33:12.256 --> 33:13.524
Okay, go,

33:13.557 --> 33:14.392
go on.

33:19.262 --> 33:20.530
You know what mom?

33:20.564 --> 33:21.532
I'm fine.

33:23.232 --> 33:24.534
You sure?

33:24.567 --> 33:25.568
Yeah.

33:25.602 --> 33:26.403
No, I'm good.

33:26.436 --> 33:27.337
Like I said,

33:27.371 --> 33:28.139
it's just like lack of sleep

33:28.172 --> 33:29.140
and it's like, stress,

33:29.173 --> 33:30.473
I just don't feel good.

33:33.509 --> 33:34.744
Okay.

33:41.351 --> 33:43.521
So I called planned Parenthood

33:43.554 --> 33:45.489
and they said that I
can get an abortion.

33:47.124 --> 33:48.291
But.

33:48.325 --> 33:49.593
I need parental consent.

33:49.625 --> 33:51.162
You need me to come
talk to your mom?

33:51.194 --> 33:52.462
No.

33:53.329 --> 33:54.397
I want you to consent.

33:54.431 --> 33:55.365
What do you mean?

33:55.398 --> 33:57.534
I want you to be my parent.

33:57.567 --> 33:58.368
What?

33:58.402 --> 33:59.636
It'll be simple, okay?

33:59.670 --> 34:00.571
Kristen

34:00.604 --> 34:02.073
I'll Photoshop us fake IDs.

34:02.105 --> 34:02.705
It's not that simple.

34:02.739 --> 34:03.641
Yes it is!

34:03.673 --> 34:04.575
I know this girl that's 14

34:04.607 --> 34:06.277
and her sister posed as her mom.

34:06.309 --> 34:07.310
I'm not going to do that.

34:07.344 --> 34:08.345
What else can I do?

34:08.378 --> 34:09.580
Talk to your parents.

34:09.612 --> 34:10.380
Involve them, figure
it out with them.

34:10.414 --> 34:11.482
I can come with you.

34:11.514 --> 34:12.382
I can't.

34:12.416 --> 34:13.451
You have to.

34:13.483 --> 34:14.617
Not if you help me.

34:14.650 --> 34:15.485
You said that you
would help me, Valerie!

34:15.518 --> 34:16.319
I wanna help you,

34:16.353 --> 34:17.488
but this would not
be helping you.

34:17.521 --> 34:18.422
Yes it is!

34:18.454 --> 34:19.489
What is the problem with this?

34:19.523 --> 34:20.490
There are other complications

34:20.523 --> 34:21.491
that you are

34:21.525 --> 34:22.492
not thinking about.

34:22.525 --> 34:23.493
For one thing it's illegal

34:23.527 --> 34:24.494
and I could go to jail.

34:24.527 --> 34:25.495
No, you won't

34:25.528 --> 34:26.496
because no one would know...

34:26.530 --> 34:27.531
I would know.

34:27.563 --> 34:28.531
And if anyone ever found out,

34:28.565 --> 34:29.767
then everybody would know.

34:29.800 --> 34:31.202
And then I would be in
really deep trouble.

34:31.235 --> 34:31.669
I'm sorry, but you are
thinking about this

34:31.702 --> 34:32.670
like a child.

34:46.483 --> 34:47.451
Hey.

34:47.483 --> 34:50.653
The Reynolds Brothers
put an offer in writing.

34:53.657 --> 34:54.825
Wow.

34:54.858 --> 34:56.193
Exactly.

34:56.226 --> 34:57.428
Cash too.

34:57.460 --> 35:00.263
No financing, no
rezoning, nothing.

35:00.297 --> 35:04.400
This could be an answer to all
of our money problems, Matt.

35:04.434 --> 35:05.836
I could finally divorce

35:05.869 --> 35:07.671
that underemployed loser

35:07.704 --> 35:10.708
who snores next
to me every night.

35:10.740 --> 35:13.911
You and Anna could buy a house.

35:16.445 --> 35:17.413
What do you want to do?

35:18.648 --> 35:19.549
Jesus Christ.

35:19.583 --> 35:21.251
I need to think about it.

35:21.284 --> 35:22.286
What is there to think about?

35:22.318 --> 35:23.554
Just sign the goddamn papers.

35:23.586 --> 35:24.688
I need more time.

35:24.721 --> 35:25.755
More time.

35:25.789 --> 35:26.757
All right?

35:26.789 --> 35:27.757
Fine.

35:29.693 --> 35:31.228
Your contracts.

35:31.260 --> 35:32.228
Just keep it.

35:41.938 --> 35:44.474
Okay we need to
split this one.

35:44.507 --> 35:46.342
I'm out until Jeff
gets back tomorrow.

35:46.376 --> 35:47.545
Okay.

35:47.577 --> 35:48.545
Let's do it.

35:50.880 --> 35:51.882
Oh my God.

35:51.914 --> 35:54.585
Kristen, that is so disturbing.

35:54.617 --> 35:56.886
Your toes are literally
going to fall off.

35:56.920 --> 35:57.887
They're so infected.

35:57.920 --> 35:59.256
Shut up, Hannah.

36:00.456 --> 36:01.659
Okay.

36:01.692 --> 36:02.525
Let me show you
the big girl way.

36:02.559 --> 36:03.760
I can't do the
tongue thing, Hannah.

36:03.793 --> 36:04.427
That's not what I mean.

36:04.460 --> 36:05.261
Come here.

36:16.505 --> 36:17.407
Hannah.

36:17.440 --> 36:18.908
You're not wearing underwear.

36:18.942 --> 36:20.510
You're shaved down there...

36:20.543 --> 36:21.711
Waxed.

36:21.744 --> 36:23.380
Shaving leaves
little skank bumps.

36:23.413 --> 36:24.481
Okay whatever just...

36:24.514 --> 36:25.983
please do it, show me...

36:26.016 --> 36:27.851
Pay attention, Princeton girl.

36:27.884 --> 36:29.253
You gotta be careful

36:29.286 --> 36:30.820
and get the femoral
vein just right,

36:30.853 --> 36:32.589
because it's real close

36:32.623 --> 36:34.291
to the holiest of holies.

36:37.360 --> 36:38.728
Okay.

36:52.809 --> 36:53.811
Hannah.

36:54.945 --> 36:56.914
Hannah, you shot all of it.

36:59.650 --> 37:00.784
Fuck, Hannah!

37:01.818 --> 37:02.786
Hey, come on in.

37:02.818 --> 37:03.820
Shut the door.

37:03.853 --> 37:04.821
Come on, come on, come on.

37:06.722 --> 37:08.558
More good news.

37:08.592 --> 37:09.793
I cornered Jim O'Hara,

37:09.826 --> 37:10.793
VP of marketing and sales

37:10.827 --> 37:12.263
at the bar after the outing,

37:12.295 --> 37:13.963
he hinted that I was
on the short list

37:13.996 --> 37:16.000
for the regional manager's job!

37:16.032 --> 37:17.835
That is great Gill!

37:17.867 --> 37:18.835
You'd be so good at that!

37:18.869 --> 37:19.937
Congratulations.

37:19.969 --> 37:21.871
Oh, thank you.

37:21.905 --> 37:23.841
But that's not all.

37:23.873 --> 37:24.841
I told him about you.

37:24.875 --> 37:26.510
That you're my rising star.

37:26.543 --> 37:27.711
You did?

37:27.744 --> 37:28.577
Yeah.

37:28.612 --> 37:29.713
I told him you're
definitely in line

37:29.746 --> 37:30.713
for the relo job

37:30.746 --> 37:31.914
and that you'd be a natural

37:31.947 --> 37:34.484
to fill my position as office
manager when I get promoted.

37:34.518 --> 37:35.885
You said that?

37:35.918 --> 37:36.886
Hell yeah, I did!

37:36.920 --> 37:38.289
That's so sweet of you.

37:38.322 --> 37:39.757
Guess what, he's
coming in next month.

37:39.789 --> 37:41.724
He wants to take us to lunch.

37:41.757 --> 37:42.859
What the fuck!

37:42.893 --> 37:44.728
I don't even know what to say.

37:44.760 --> 37:45.762
Yeah!

37:45.795 --> 37:46.829
Thank you.

41:08.731 --> 41:09.733
I panicked!

41:16.539 --> 41:17.875
We're so fucked.

41:25.849 --> 41:27.585
Step outta the car.

41:42.998 --> 41:44.968
Jesus Christ, Kristen.

41:47.836 --> 41:48.838
Get up to bed.

41:56.980 --> 41:59.248
What happens now?

41:59.282 --> 42:00.617
Kristen and Hannah,

42:00.650 --> 42:02.052
have to take a
urine test tomorrow

42:02.085 --> 42:03.253
at the clinic.

42:03.286 --> 42:05.722
And if they test
positive for heroin,

42:05.755 --> 42:07.023
they'll be charged

42:07.056 --> 42:09.926
with possession of a
controlled substance.

42:09.960 --> 42:10.894
My God.

42:12.061 --> 42:13.230
But.

42:13.262 --> 42:16.032
If what Kristen says is true,

42:16.065 --> 42:19.569
and they were buying
the heroin for a friend,

42:19.603 --> 42:22.972
it will be reduced to a
minor in possession charge,

42:23.005 --> 42:24.074
which,

42:24.106 --> 42:25.842
is not permanent, but,

42:25.875 --> 42:27.911
it'll stay in her
file until she's 18.

42:37.887 --> 42:39.755
Can't you just shoot this
freaking thing already?

42:39.789 --> 42:40.857
Oh, shucks.

42:40.889 --> 42:42.025
What a great idea.

42:42.057 --> 42:43.793
Shoot the coyote

42:43.827 --> 42:45.095
that's been
terrorizing this place

42:45.128 --> 42:46.363
the last two fucking years.

42:46.396 --> 42:47.731
Why didn't I think of that?

42:47.764 --> 42:48.765
Don't be a wise ass.

42:48.797 --> 42:49.799
Shoot it, Mary?

42:49.833 --> 42:51.902
This coyote is so slippery,

42:51.934 --> 42:53.135
I barely got a look at it,

42:53.168 --> 42:54.670
let alone a shot.

42:54.704 --> 42:55.939
Well if you would sell it
to the Reynolds Brothers,

42:55.972 --> 42:57.140
they would deal with
this cagey coyote.

42:57.172 --> 42:59.208
And every other headache that
comes along with this place,

42:59.242 --> 43:02.012
but more importantly,
you and I would be rich.

43:02.045 --> 43:03.246
Look.

43:03.278 --> 43:05.114
Dad already sold all
his other property

43:05.148 --> 43:07.150
to those pencil
necks before he died.

43:07.182 --> 43:09.052
He wanted to keep
this place pure.

43:11.021 --> 43:12.155
Yeah well dad also wanted more

43:12.188 --> 43:13.323
than a real estate tax bills

43:13.356 --> 43:15.325
and a rogue coyote.

43:15.358 --> 43:16.326
Damn it.

43:16.358 --> 43:17.960
I'm going to go get the tractor.

43:17.994 --> 43:21.198
I can't even get a burger
out of that beauty.

43:22.699 --> 43:23.900
God damn coyotes
ruined the meat.

43:51.460 --> 43:52.862
Jeffy.

43:52.896 --> 43:55.865
He had one of his
boys drop it to me.

43:55.898 --> 43:57.266
He said at this clinic,

43:57.300 --> 43:58.301
they strip search you

43:58.333 --> 44:00.236
and they look everywhere.

44:00.269 --> 44:02.204
I mean everywhere.

44:02.237 --> 44:03.973
Just slip it in like a tampon

44:04.007 --> 44:04.974
before you leave your house.

44:05.007 --> 44:06.143
When they ask for the sample,

44:06.175 --> 44:07.443
unscrew the cap,

44:07.476 --> 44:08.878
fill the cup

44:08.911 --> 44:10.947
and put the empty
one back inside you.

44:12.181 --> 44:13.683
I don't know Hannah.

44:13.717 --> 44:15.117

Kristen McKusker.

45:49.211 --> 45:51.981
Aren't you Kristen McKusker?

46:18.141 --> 46:19.242
This way.

46:32.054 --> 46:35.525
I need you to turn
around and face the wall.

46:38.360 --> 46:41.297
Place your hands on the wall.

46:41.331 --> 46:44.134
Keep them flush
against the wall.

46:44.166 --> 46:46.502
Do not move your hands from
the wall until I tell you to.

46:46.536 --> 46:48.238
Do you understand?

47:01.416 --> 47:03.420
What's in your pocket?

47:03.452 --> 47:05.989
I think my chap stick.

47:06.021 --> 47:07.556
Do you have anything illegal

47:07.590 --> 47:09.893
or any drug
paraphernalia on you?

47:09.925 --> 47:12.328
Is there anything that's
going to stick me?

47:12.362 --> 47:13.329
No.

47:13.362 --> 47:14.330
Poke me, injure me?

47:15.931 --> 47:16.899
No.

47:19.469 --> 47:21.570
Leave your hands on the wall.

47:23.472 --> 47:24.474
Spread your legs.

47:29.512 --> 47:31.147
Okay.

47:31.179 --> 47:32.315
You can remove your hands
from the wall and turn around.

47:37.019 --> 47:38.454
Remove all of your
clothing, Kristen,

47:38.487 --> 47:40.422
including underwear.

48:09.552 --> 48:11.355
Everything Kristen.

48:20.496 --> 48:21.463
Okay.

48:21.496 --> 48:25.467
Turn around and face the wall.

48:28.538 --> 48:29.472
Bend forward, Kristen.

48:31.340 --> 48:33.175
Bend forward, Kristen.

48:35.510 --> 48:36.646
Now reach around

48:36.679 --> 48:39.316
and spread your cheeks.

48:50.525 --> 48:52.127
Stand up.

48:52.161 --> 48:54.264
You can turn back around,

48:55.465 --> 48:58.969
see the nurse and
give me a sample.

49:00.469 --> 49:02.705
Right over there.

49:03.773 --> 49:05.675
I think I'm addicted.

49:06.641 --> 49:08.444
What did you say?

49:11.414 --> 49:12.215
Kristen?

49:12.248 --> 49:13.150
Look at me.

49:17.152 --> 49:18.387
I'm addicted.

49:20.489 --> 49:22.358
What do you mean?

49:22.391 --> 49:23.527
You're addicted?

49:24.460 --> 49:25.427
To heroin.

49:25.460 --> 49:26.495
What?

49:29.297 --> 49:30.500
Oh my god.

49:30.532 --> 49:31.701
The baby.

49:38.608 --> 49:39.443
How?

49:40.376 --> 49:41.578
How did it start?

49:41.610 --> 49:43.446
How everyone starts.

49:44.547 --> 49:45.581
Oxy.

49:45.614 --> 49:47.984
Oxycontin the pain pill?

49:49.351 --> 49:50.552
Yeah.

49:52.621 --> 49:55.057
Yeah the pain pill.

49:56.492 --> 49:57.393
How can one pill...

49:57.427 --> 50:01.197
It's like nothing
I've ever felt before.

50:01.230 --> 50:02.132
Ever.

50:03.331 --> 50:04.400
I don't even know
how to explain it

50:04.434 --> 50:05.535
it's like if you take

50:05.568 --> 50:10.105
like all the good things
that have ever happened to me

50:10.139 --> 50:13.376
and you like combine
it into one thing.

50:14.476 --> 50:16.145
Valerie, I swear to you,

50:16.179 --> 50:18.347
it would not even compare

50:18.380 --> 50:20.382
to that Oxy high I
felt with Brandon.

50:20.416 --> 50:23.686
How did it go from
Oxycontin to heroin?

50:23.719 --> 50:25.387
Oxy is

50:25.420 --> 50:27.322
$80 a pill.

50:27.356 --> 50:29.626
It's really hard to find.

50:32.094 --> 50:34.230
Heroin's $10 for a bag.

50:34.262 --> 50:36.199
And it's a better high.

50:37.365 --> 50:39.436
Just do the math.

50:39.469 --> 50:41.336
It doesn't make any sense.

50:41.369 --> 50:44.239
Not with the
Kristen that I know.

50:47.510 --> 50:49.479
The Kristen that you know

50:49.512 --> 50:52.082
is not the Kristen that I know.

50:56.318 --> 50:59.456
Heroin makes me
who I wish I was.

52:01.684 --> 52:03.320
Vampires again.

52:14.697 --> 52:16.733
Kiki?

52:16.766 --> 52:17.666
Are you okay?

52:22.905 --> 52:24.941
Should I get mommy?

52:36.952 --> 52:39.655
I don't want you sick Kiki.

52:46.762 --> 52:48.198
I love you, Kiki.

53:05.514 --> 53:06.516
I'm dope sick.

53:07.750 --> 53:08.617
I need to stay here just
for a couple of days

53:08.650 --> 53:09.652
until I get clean.

53:09.684 --> 53:10.552
What?

53:10.585 --> 53:11.653
I started cold turkey
like two days ago,

53:11.686 --> 53:12.922
and I take the Suboxone,

53:12.954 --> 53:14.324
and it's taking off the edge,

53:14.356 --> 53:15.358
I just need a couple more days...

53:15.391 --> 53:16.626
What about your parents?

53:16.659 --> 53:17.961
My dad's going to be
away on business trip.

53:17.994 --> 53:20.563
I wish I could quit my job.

53:20.596 --> 53:21.664
And?

53:21.697 --> 53:23.865
My mom's going to some,
like, realtor convention

53:23.898 --> 53:24.933
in New Orleans.

53:24.967 --> 53:25.934
What do you mean, and?

53:25.967 --> 53:26.935
Your mom is,

53:26.969 --> 53:28.605
is still going to go to that?

53:28.637 --> 53:29.438
Even, everything that
happened with the police?

53:29.472 --> 53:30.740
Yeah.

53:30.773 --> 53:31.641
It's like,

53:31.673 --> 53:32.608
I think it's, it's
paid for by her boss.

53:32.641 --> 53:34.777
She's on some kind of
promotion or something.

53:34.809 --> 53:36.813
Just say what you
really want to say, Clare.

53:36.846 --> 53:37.713
What are you talking...

53:37.746 --> 53:40.349
Just say, Bill, if
you made more money,

53:40.382 --> 53:41.884
I wouldn't have to work,

53:41.916 --> 53:42.884
and everything would be perfect.

53:42.918 --> 53:44.287
My parents talked it over.

53:44.320 --> 53:45.955
And they're gonna go
with the original plan.

53:45.987 --> 53:48.257
Maddie's gonna stay at her
friend Mackenzie's house

53:48.291 --> 53:50.026
and I already talked my mom
that I could stay with you.

53:50.059 --> 53:51.261
What?

53:51.293 --> 53:52.795
Kristen.

53:52.827 --> 53:54.329
That's not what I meant.

53:54.362 --> 53:55.697
Yes.

53:55.731 --> 53:56.666
It was.

53:56.699 --> 53:57.599
She trusts you

53:57.634 --> 53:59.501
you've been babysitting
me since I was four.

53:59.534 --> 54:00.603
And it's the only way
that she's going to go,

54:00.635 --> 54:02.471
and it's the only way that
I'm going to get better.

54:06.675 --> 54:07.476
What about school?

54:07.510 --> 54:08.711
= I'm off school today

54:08.744 --> 54:09.778
and Friday because
of a teacher thing.

54:09.811 --> 54:12.648
And then it's the weekend,
so it'll be four days.

54:12.681 --> 54:13.949
It's just four days...

54:13.983 --> 54:15.485
I don't know, Kristen.

54:15.518 --> 54:17.387
I'm sorry.

54:17.420 --> 54:18.688
Valerie, please.

54:18.721 --> 54:19.956
Please, I swear that

54:19.989 --> 54:21.557
I'll tell my
parents I'm pregnant

54:21.590 --> 54:22.725
right after I get clean.

54:24.592 --> 54:26.663
Please, help me.

54:35.371 --> 54:36.939
Like, I don't think
I can do this.

54:38.740 --> 54:39.909
Everything hurts.

54:41.476 --> 54:43.045
Do you want me to
get you anything?

54:43.079 --> 54:44.047
No, ow!

54:44.079 --> 54:45.081
No.

54:45.114 --> 54:46.481
Okay sorry.

54:53.489 --> 54:55.590
I'm just so uncomfortable!

54:55.623 --> 54:56.925
I know.

54:56.958 --> 54:58.860
I have to go again.

55:00.730 --> 55:02.764
All right why don't
you have a sip of water,

55:02.797 --> 55:03.799
why don't you sit down...

55:03.833 --> 55:04.767
I don't want a sip of water.

55:04.800 --> 55:05.802
Okay.

55:05.835 --> 55:06.869
I need it really bad.

55:08.637 --> 55:09.639
I know.

55:09.672 --> 55:10.639
I need it.

55:11.673 --> 55:12.675
I need it.

55:12.708 --> 55:13.675
You just gotta get through it

55:13.708 --> 55:14.676
there's nothing else you can do.

55:14.710 --> 55:15.677
It's just time, okay?

55:15.710 --> 55:16.678
How much time?

55:16.711 --> 55:17.545
I don't know, okay?

55:17.579 --> 55:18.748
I do not know how
much fucking time!

55:18.780 --> 55:19.715
Don't yell at me.

55:20.583 --> 55:21.884
I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry.

55:21.916 --> 55:22.719
I just really don't feel good.

55:23.985 --> 55:24.953
Kristen, your
mom's calling again.

55:25.987 --> 55:26.955
Come on, get it together.

55:26.989 --> 55:27.956
You got to pick it up.

55:27.989 --> 55:28.990
Come on, get it together

55:29.023 --> 55:29.958
and pick up the phone.

55:29.992 --> 55:30.993
Your mom's calling.

55:31.025 --> 55:32.461
You need to drink this water.

55:32.494 --> 55:33.695
You are the one who
made yourself sick.

55:33.728 --> 55:34.396
So then you have to
make yourself better.

55:34.429 --> 55:35.498
Okay?

55:35.530 --> 55:36.498
Okay, I'll drink it.

55:36.532 --> 55:37.500
I'll drink the water.

55:37.532 --> 55:38.934
Thank you.

55:41.637 --> 55:42.772
Can you drink the
whole thing please?

55:47.909 --> 55:49.878
I'm gonna throw
up now, so thanks.

55:49.911 --> 55:51.012
All right.

55:51.045 --> 55:52.013
I don't need that attitude.

55:53.047 --> 55:54.015
Kristen.

55:55.818 --> 55:56.919
Why are you crying?

55:58.954 --> 56:00.456
I don't know.

56:00.489 --> 56:01.724
I can't stop crying.

57:01.951 --> 57:05.054
I appreciate you
doing this for me.

57:05.086 --> 57:06.956
Yeah, you're welcome.

57:08.257 --> 57:09.224
You'd do the same for me?

57:10.259 --> 57:11.461
Always.

57:11.494 --> 57:12.528
Hopefully that never happens.

57:18.666 --> 57:20.603
Good new product, baby.

57:20.635 --> 57:21.637
Lucifer.

57:21.670 --> 57:22.905
Laced with fentanyl

57:22.938 --> 57:24.673
tell all your friends

57:24.706 --> 57:25.740
it's a million times better

57:25.773 --> 57:26.842
than Die Hard Nine.

57:26.876 --> 57:28.744
For you Catholic girls,

57:28.777 --> 57:30.679
it's like having an
orgasm in heaven.

57:30.713 --> 57:32.548
I'll tell them boo!

57:32.581 --> 57:34.550
And stay away
from serial killer.

57:34.583 --> 57:37.519
That scumbag Mazio is
givin' it away for free.

57:37.552 --> 57:40.056
Cut with carfentanyl,

57:40.088 --> 57:41.824
fucking elephant tranquilizer.

57:41.856 --> 57:45.027

58:12.121 --> 58:13.956
Course I remembered.

58:27.202 --> 58:29.205
What's your wish, baby?

58:41.983 --> 58:43.286
Really?

58:43.318 --> 58:44.686
You love me.

58:45.588 --> 58:47.123
Right boo?

58:47.155 --> 58:47.989
I mean,

58:48.023 --> 58:49.559
really love me?

58:51.126 --> 58:52.161
Always.

59:07.141 --> 59:08.143
Kristen!

59:08.177 --> 59:09.345
Come on, let's get coffee!

59:09.378 --> 59:10.613
Hey Hannah,

59:10.646 --> 59:11.614
I can't today.

59:11.646 --> 59:12.614
I have,

59:12.648 --> 59:13.615
I have a paper due.

59:13.648 --> 59:14.650
Dude wait.

59:19.121 --> 59:21.057
Dude, finish it later.

59:21.090 --> 59:22.124
Let's hang out.

59:22.157 --> 59:23.125
I can't.

59:23.157 --> 59:25.929
I'm trying to get my grades up.

59:27.161 --> 59:28.663
Alright.

59:28.697 --> 59:30.599
What's going on?

59:30.632 --> 59:31.600
What do you mean?

59:31.634 --> 59:32.601
You avoid me all day?

59:32.635 --> 59:33.636
No, not really.

59:33.668 --> 59:34.903
Yeah, you do.

59:36.338 --> 59:38.074
You don't return my calls.

59:38.106 --> 59:39.307
You leave my texts on read.

59:39.340 --> 59:41.844
You haven't liked one
of my Instagram pictures

59:41.876 --> 59:43.012
in like a month.

59:43.045 --> 59:47.115
Actually I don't remember the
last time that we hung out.

59:48.282 --> 59:51.186
I have to tell you
about me and Jeffy.

59:52.054 --> 59:53.088
We did it.

59:54.056 --> 59:55.724
It was amazing...

59:55.757 --> 59:57.726
I'm busy, Hannah.

59:59.193 --> 1:00:00.896
Too busy for me?

1:00:04.032 --> 1:00:04.933
What is it?

1:00:05.934 --> 1:00:06.769
What?

1:00:11.306 --> 1:00:15.811
Hannah, I can't shoot that
poison inside me anymore.

1:00:17.846 --> 1:00:19.315
I got clean, Hannah.

1:00:21.215 --> 1:00:22.050
How?

1:00:22.885 --> 1:00:24.186
I just did.

1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:26.922
I mean.

1:00:26.954 --> 1:00:27.922
Good for you.

1:00:29.056 --> 1:00:30.959
But what does that have
to do with us hanging out?

1:00:30.992 --> 1:00:32.260
It's hard for me
not to do that shit

1:00:32.293 --> 1:00:33.795
when I'm with you,

1:00:33.829 --> 1:00:36.198
you make me want to do it, okay?

1:00:38.132 --> 1:00:39.768
You're too good for me now?

1:00:39.802 --> 1:00:41.204
Princeton girl?

1:00:42.103 --> 1:00:45.006
I'm dealing with something.

1:00:45.039 --> 1:00:47.342
What are you dealing with?

1:00:47.376 --> 1:00:49.245
You can tell me.

1:00:49.277 --> 1:00:50.245
I'll help you.

1:00:50.278 --> 1:00:52.014
We're best friends.

1:00:52.914 --> 1:00:54.215
Kristen.

1:00:54.248 --> 1:00:55.817
You coming?

1:00:55.851 --> 1:00:56.786
Yeah, just, yeah.

1:00:56.818 --> 1:00:58.253
Hold on.

1:01:00.722 --> 1:01:03.726
We're best friends, right?

1:01:09.030 --> 1:01:09.865
Okay.

1:01:38.226 --> 1:01:39.228
Why?

1:01:39.260 --> 1:01:40.228
He's always off leash.

1:01:40.262 --> 1:01:41.230

1:02:19.400 --> 1:02:21.336
It's been six weeks,

1:02:22.471 --> 1:02:23.306
six weeks.

1:02:25.273 --> 1:02:26.875
I had to score

1:02:26.909 --> 1:02:27.977
from Nick Mazio.

1:02:28.010 --> 1:02:28.845
Aww.

1:02:30.344 --> 1:02:31.312
Look at you.

1:02:33.114 --> 1:02:34.149
I wanted to talk about

1:02:34.182 --> 1:02:35.150
what we did.

1:02:37.418 --> 1:02:38.920
It was so special, wasn't it?

1:02:41.489 --> 1:02:43.091
It was special, right?

1:03:32.641 --> 1:03:33.442
Hey.

1:03:33.474 --> 1:03:34.409
Hey.

1:03:34.443 --> 1:03:35.444
Who's this?

1:03:35.476 --> 1:03:36.444
This is Hudson.

1:03:36.478 --> 1:03:37.445
Can you say hi?

1:03:37.478 --> 1:03:38.446
Hey Hudson!

1:03:38.480 --> 1:03:39.481
Hi!

1:03:40.514 --> 1:03:41.516
He loves the scones here.

1:03:41.550 --> 1:03:43.252
Aw, he's really cute.

1:03:43.284 --> 1:03:44.420
Is that your brother?

1:03:44.452 --> 1:03:45.286
Uh, no, I'm
actually his nanny.

1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:47.222
It's a great gig.

1:03:47.255 --> 1:03:48.324
It's like 20 hours a week

1:03:48.356 --> 1:03:49.358
every day after school

1:03:49.391 --> 1:03:50.358
until his mom gets home.

1:03:50.391 --> 1:03:51.359
15 bucks an hour cash.

1:03:51.393 --> 1:03:53.161
Dude, that's awesome.

1:03:53.195 --> 1:03:54.163
Yeah.

1:03:54.195 --> 1:03:55.331
Yeah.

1:03:55.364 --> 1:03:56.532
Do you need any

1:03:56.565 --> 1:03:58.267
lucifer?

1:03:58.300 --> 1:03:59.936
That stuff's insane.

1:04:02.204 --> 1:04:03.172
No, I'm good.

1:04:03.204 --> 1:04:04.440
Are you sure?

1:04:04.472 --> 1:04:07.275
It's so much better
than DH nine.

1:04:07.309 --> 1:04:08.978
Yeah.

1:04:09.010 --> 1:04:09.978
I'm good.

1:04:10.012 --> 1:04:11.046
Okay.

1:04:11.079 --> 1:04:12.047
Say bye!

1:04:12.079 --> 1:04:13.148
Bye Kristen.

1:04:13.181 --> 1:04:14.282
Bye.

1:04:14.315 --> 1:04:15.384
Bye Hudson.

1:04:17.219 --> 1:04:18.220
Hi baby.

1:04:46.213 --> 1:04:47.048
Kristen.

1:04:49.384 --> 1:04:52.454
You need to tell your
parents about the baby.

1:04:54.056 --> 1:04:54.891
It's time.

1:04:56.724 --> 1:04:59.094
You can't wait any longer.

1:05:02.331 --> 1:05:03.164
Look, I,

1:05:03.197 --> 1:05:04.500
I'll go with you.

1:05:04.532 --> 1:05:06.402
We can do it together.

1:05:06.434 --> 1:05:08.436
If that's what you want.

1:05:10.005 --> 1:05:10.640
Okay?

1:05:19.347 --> 1:05:21.382
When was the last
time we did this?

1:05:21.416 --> 1:05:22.618
Too busy.

1:05:22.650 --> 1:05:24.485
Have to make more
time for each other.

1:05:24.518 --> 1:05:25.620
Yeah.

1:05:32.728 --> 1:05:34.030
Actually mom.

1:05:36.565 --> 1:05:38.666
There's something that I
want to tell you about.

1:05:38.699 --> 1:05:40.001
Yeah?

1:05:40.034 --> 1:05:41.002
Yeah.

1:05:41.036 --> 1:05:42.471
What?

1:06:02.257 --> 1:06:04.025
Hey, there's Hannah.

1:06:04.059 --> 1:06:05.527
Hannah!

1:06:05.559 --> 1:06:06.594
Hey!

1:06:17.639 --> 1:06:19.742
What's going on with her?

1:06:20.608 --> 1:06:22.610
She looks terrible.

1:06:25.579 --> 1:06:27.181
Those drugs were for her.

1:06:27.215 --> 1:06:28.217
That night, right?

1:06:28.250 --> 1:06:29.451
You're protecting her?

1:06:31.820 --> 1:06:35.224
Her dad has given
her everything.

1:06:35.257 --> 1:06:36.325
Everything.

1:06:36.358 --> 1:06:37.559
I really...

1:06:37.592 --> 1:06:38.594
Let me...

1:06:38.626 --> 1:06:39.594
Mom, I really need...

1:06:39.628 --> 1:06:40.596
I just wanted to,

1:06:40.628 --> 1:06:42.364
wait, just wait,

1:06:42.396 --> 1:06:43.398
I just wanna let you know,

1:06:43.431 --> 1:06:46.434
that I'm really proud of you.

1:06:48.302 --> 1:06:49.471
And I don't say it enough

1:06:49.503 --> 1:06:50.505
and that's my fault,

1:06:50.539 --> 1:06:51.473
but just know

1:06:51.505 --> 1:06:52.708
that I'm proud.

1:06:52.740 --> 1:06:54.143
And I love you.

1:07:03.452 --> 1:07:04.553
Thanks mom.

1:07:12.860 --> 1:07:14.496
I have to go to the bathroom.

1:07:33.380 --> 1:07:34.449
Hey Matt!

1:07:34.483 --> 1:07:35.451
Yes, how are you?

1:07:35.483 --> 1:07:37.585
Good, how have you been?

1:07:37.619 --> 1:07:38.687
Pretty good.

1:07:38.719 --> 1:07:39.687
Yeah.

1:07:39.721 --> 1:07:40.521
How about you?

1:07:40.554 --> 1:07:41.556
Good.

1:07:41.590 --> 1:07:42.557
How's Anna?

1:07:42.590 --> 1:07:43.391
She's great.

1:07:43.425 --> 1:07:44.860
She's actually in
the ladies room.

1:07:44.893 --> 1:07:46.095
I'm sure she'll be
happy to see you.

1:07:59.807 --> 1:08:01.210
I'm here with my daughter,

1:08:01.242 --> 1:08:01.710
which you'll finally
get to meet actually...

1:08:03.177 --> 1:08:03.846
Kristen.

1:08:03.878 --> 1:08:04.679
Kristen.

1:08:04.713 --> 1:08:05.714
Yeah.

1:08:06.748 --> 1:08:08.516
There's Kristen right now,

1:08:08.550 --> 1:08:09.518
Kristen, this is Matt.

1:08:09.550 --> 1:08:10.518
Matt, this is Kristen.

1:08:10.552 --> 1:08:11.519
Heard a lot about you.

1:08:17.626 --> 1:08:18.627
Jesus Christ.

1:08:18.659 --> 1:08:20.496
Honey, what happened?

1:08:20.529 --> 1:08:21.530
Hannah?

1:08:21.563 --> 1:08:22.530
Hannah?

1:08:22.564 --> 1:08:23.565
Hannah!

1:08:23.597 --> 1:08:24.600
Hannah, wake up!

1:08:24.632 --> 1:08:25.733
Call nine one one.

1:08:25.766 --> 1:08:26.734
Just relax.

1:08:26.768 --> 1:08:27.569
Give her some air.

1:08:27.601 --> 1:08:28.737
Hannah.

1:08:28.770 --> 1:08:29.671
Hannah!

1:08:29.703 --> 1:08:30.605
Hannah, that's her name?

1:08:30.639 --> 1:08:31.440
Hannah?

1:08:31.472 --> 1:08:32.373
Yeah.

1:08:32.407 --> 1:08:33.175
Come on, breathe, Hannah.

1:08:33.207 --> 1:08:34.342
Hannah, oh my god.

1:08:34.376 --> 1:08:35.144
Jesus Christ,
there's a needle here!

1:08:35.176 --> 1:08:35.743
Some kind of overdose.

1:08:35.777 --> 1:08:36.744
Honey.

1:08:36.778 --> 1:08:38.380
Tell dispatch it's an overdose.

1:08:40.314 --> 1:08:40.915
Hey, hey!

1:08:40.948 --> 1:08:41.916
Hannah!

1:08:41.949 --> 1:08:44.586
Put this under her head.

1:08:44.618 --> 1:08:45.420
Get her head right up.

1:08:45.453 --> 1:08:46.321
Thank you.

1:08:46.354 --> 1:08:47.289
Okay.

1:08:48.689 --> 1:08:49.724
She was just laying there.

1:08:52.194 --> 1:08:53.262
Turning blue.

1:08:54.695 --> 1:08:55.663
She's a kid.

1:08:58.832 --> 1:08:59.768
Hannah?

1:08:59.801 --> 1:09:00.736
Hannah.

1:09:00.769 --> 1:09:01.737
Come on, come on.

1:09:01.770 --> 1:09:03.438
She's not breathing.

1:09:03.470 --> 1:09:04.438
What!

1:09:04.471 --> 1:09:05.474
Let me do compressions.

1:09:05.506 --> 1:09:06.440
Okay.

1:09:06.474 --> 1:09:07.476
Hannah, breathe.

1:09:07.509 --> 1:09:09.677
Breathe, breathe, breathe!

1:09:10.744 --> 1:09:12.180
Oh my god

1:09:12.213 --> 1:09:13.282
breathe!

1:09:15.550 --> 1:09:16.652
Hannah.

1:09:16.685 --> 1:09:17.653

1:09:17.685 --> 1:09:18.653
Come on!

1:09:18.686 --> 1:09:19.688
So cold.

1:09:19.720 --> 1:09:20.755
Come on, dammit!

1:09:24.826 --> 1:09:26.761
Don't believe in hell,

1:09:29.363 --> 1:09:30.831
look deep into the eyes

1:09:30.864 --> 1:09:33.668
of a 16 year old heroin addict.

1:09:35.970 --> 1:09:37.205
Please, everyone.

1:09:37.238 --> 1:09:38.206
Step aside,

1:09:38.239 --> 1:09:39.207
step aside.

1:09:39.240 --> 1:09:40.208
Back please.

1:09:40.242 --> 1:09:41.243
How long has she been down?

1:09:41.275 --> 1:09:43.412
Like five minutes.

1:09:45.814 --> 1:09:46.981
She's got a pulse,
she's not breathing.

1:09:49.283 --> 1:09:51.552
Let's get the Narcan ready.

1:09:55.489 --> 1:09:56.625
Is she breathing?

1:09:56.658 --> 1:09:58.227
I'm breathing for her.

1:09:59.461 --> 1:10:00.295
Did she hit her
head when she fell?

1:10:00.328 --> 1:10:01.296
I don't know.

1:10:01.328 --> 1:10:02.331
We didn't see her fall.

1:10:02.363 --> 1:10:03.364
Here's the Narcan.

1:10:05.699 --> 1:10:07.802
Give her some room.

1:10:08.837 --> 1:10:09.738
Hannah?

1:10:14.809 --> 1:10:16.345
Come on, Hannah.

1:10:17.645 --> 1:10:18.947
Come on.

1:10:18.979 --> 1:10:20.815
Come on Hannah.

1:10:20.849 --> 1:10:21.850
Hannah, come on.

1:10:21.882 --> 1:10:22.984
She's still not breathing.

1:10:23.018 --> 1:10:24.252
Come on, Hannah.

1:10:24.286 --> 1:10:25.386
Come on, come on.

1:10:26.488 --> 1:10:27.489
Let's get a second dose.

1:10:31.393 --> 1:10:32.761
Give her some room.

1:10:39.567 --> 1:10:41.770
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:10:44.005 --> 1:10:45.774
Hannah, lay back.

1:10:45.806 --> 1:10:46.774
No!

1:10:46.807 --> 1:10:47.708
Hannah, Hannah, Hannah.

1:10:47.742 --> 1:10:48.777
Hannah.

1:10:48.810 --> 1:10:49.811
Lay back.

1:10:49.844 --> 1:10:51.546
Get off!

1:10:51.578 --> 1:10:52.947
Lay back for me.

1:10:52.980 --> 1:10:54.048
Hannah, Hannah, Hannah.

1:11:48.069 --> 1:11:49.538
Clare never mentioned a thing

1:11:49.570 --> 1:11:50.838
about her daughter
being pregnant.

1:11:50.872 --> 1:11:52.740
All she ever talks
about is her kid

1:11:52.774 --> 1:11:53.875
going to Princeton.

1:11:53.908 --> 1:11:55.711
Think she even knows?

1:11:55.743 --> 1:11:58.012
How could a mother not know?

1:12:01.515 --> 1:12:02.583
Matty?

1:12:02.617 --> 1:12:03.585
Yeah.

1:12:03.618 --> 1:12:05.020
Do you think that her Daughter

1:12:05.052 --> 1:12:08.657
might be giving the
baby up for adoption?

1:12:40.654 --> 1:12:41.889
Kiki, open the door.

1:12:41.922 --> 1:12:43.091
I had a dream.

1:12:45.859 --> 1:12:46.693
Go away, Maddie.

1:12:46.728 --> 1:12:50.065
It was Pennywise
from IT this time.

1:12:52.900 --> 1:12:53.868
Please Maddie just

1:12:54.969 --> 1:12:55.936
not tonight.

1:13:05.846 --> 1:13:07.148
Kiki?

1:13:07.181 --> 1:13:08.617
I'm scared.

1:13:09.516 --> 1:13:10.885
Go away.

1:14:02.904 --> 1:14:04.039
Help!

1:14:04.072 --> 1:14:05.806
Someone help!

1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:08.043
I just want to
confirm with your office

1:14:08.076 --> 1:14:10.744
that I have the right
to kill this thing

1:14:10.778 --> 1:14:12.514
and you're not
going to send some,

1:14:12.546 --> 1:14:14.181
Barney Fife game warden guy

1:14:14.215 --> 1:14:17.552
down here and hit
me with a big fine.

1:14:17.585 --> 1:14:18.819
It came out of nowhere.

1:14:20.054 --> 1:14:21.690
And started attacking.

1:14:21.722 --> 1:14:23.524
I understand the
humane Disposition

1:14:23.557 --> 1:14:25.060
of the problem.

1:14:25.092 --> 1:14:26.694
Did you come near you guys?

1:14:30.832 --> 1:14:32.634
It's killing innocent things.

1:14:32.667 --> 1:14:35.237
And I'm really concerned
about what it will do next.

1:14:44.279 --> 1:14:45.580
Yeah, well, guess what?

1:14:45.613 --> 1:14:48.048
It's not your
fucking property pal.

1:14:48.082 --> 1:14:49.217
It's my property.

1:14:49.250 --> 1:14:51.086
And I want to know
that I have the right

1:14:51.118 --> 1:14:52.920
to kill this thing.

1:14:53.587 --> 1:14:55.289
Yeah, that's what I thought.

1:14:55.323 --> 1:14:56.525
All right.

1:14:56.557 --> 1:14:57.525
Thank you sir.

1:14:57.559 --> 1:14:58.527
You have a nice day.

1:14:58.560 --> 1:14:59.928
Fuckin' a, man.

1:14:59.961 --> 1:15:01.096
Hannah.

1:15:01.128 --> 1:15:02.296
What?

1:15:02.329 --> 1:15:03.998
Hey, I miss you.

1:15:04.032 --> 1:15:05.900
How are you feeling?

1:15:07.868 --> 1:15:10.905
Dude that was really scary
at the Bistro, right?

1:15:10.939 --> 1:15:14.009
Kristen, why did you call me?

1:15:14.042 --> 1:15:16.811
Do you wanna come over?

1:15:16.844 --> 1:15:18.680
That's not an option.

1:15:18.712 --> 1:15:20.715
Hannah, look,

1:15:20.747 --> 1:15:22.783
I was going through
some stuff, okay?

1:15:22.817 --> 1:15:24.051
We're cool now.

1:15:25.118 --> 1:15:26.820
Hannah?

1:15:26.854 --> 1:15:28.088
I need something really bad.

1:15:28.122 --> 1:15:29.090
Okay?

1:15:29.122 --> 1:15:30.024
Really bad.

1:15:31.125 --> 1:15:32.895
Like a best friend?

1:15:35.662 --> 1:15:37.131
Hannah, I need to get well

1:15:37.164 --> 1:15:38.132
right now.

1:15:38.166 --> 1:15:39.001
Seriously.

1:15:42.737 --> 1:15:43.805

of the deposit.

1:21:14.001 --> 1:21:15.503
There's your half.

1:21:17.438 --> 1:21:20.175
Put a down payment

1:21:21.442 --> 1:21:23.444
Do the in vitro.

1:21:23.476 --> 1:21:26.381

Cheers.

1:22:00.981 --> 1:22:01.582
Thank you.

1:22:01.614 --> 1:22:03.350
That's good.

1:22:39.153 --> 1:22:42.289
I sold my angels road listing.

1:22:42.323 --> 1:22:43.758
To a cute young couple

1:22:43.791 --> 1:22:45.327
that reminded me

1:22:46.426 --> 1:22:47.261
of us.

1:23:02.643 --> 1:23:04.145
You've reached Clare McKusker.

1:23:04.177 --> 1:23:05.613
To us.

1:23:05.645 --> 1:23:07.215
To us.

1:23:25.565 --> 1:23:26.733
Hi, you've reached Valerie.

1:23:26.766 --> 1:23:28.469
Sorry I missed your call.

1:23:28.502 --> 1:23:30.605
Leave a message, and I'll
give you a call back.

1:23:31.671 --> 1:23:32.672
You need to help me.

1:23:58.298 --> 1:23:59.266
Hey babe.

1:23:59.300 --> 1:24:00.068
Hey.

1:24:01.868 --> 1:24:03.570
How's my hero?

1:24:03.604 --> 1:24:04.672
Hero?

1:24:04.704 --> 1:24:06.407
Yeah right.

1:24:07.707 --> 1:24:09.210
You are my hero.

1:24:09.243 --> 1:24:11.679
We're finally getting
our dream home, Matty.

1:24:11.712 --> 1:24:13.381
And I can do the in vitro.

1:24:13.413 --> 1:24:15.416
I mean could the timing of
the nature preserve sale

1:24:15.448 --> 1:24:16.416
be more perfect?

1:24:16.449 --> 1:24:17.551
Yeah.

1:24:19.353 --> 1:24:21.288
Perfect timing.

1:24:21.322 --> 1:24:22.523
What's the matter?

1:24:22.555 --> 1:24:23.657
You're quiet.

1:24:25.859 --> 1:24:27.094
Matty?

1:24:27.127 --> 1:24:28.095
Yeah, babe?

1:24:28.128 --> 1:24:29.596
I left a message with Clare

1:24:29.630 --> 1:24:31.498
and told her that I'd drop
off the second deposit check

1:24:31.532 --> 1:24:33.167
at her house tomorrow morning.

1:24:37.203 --> 1:24:38.171
I was thinking that
when I'm there,

1:24:38.204 --> 1:24:39.606
I could ask her

1:24:39.640 --> 1:24:42.677
if she's considering adoption
for her daughter's baby.

1:24:44.578 --> 1:24:45.546
And if she is,

1:24:45.578 --> 1:24:46.581
would she consider us.

1:24:48.748 --> 1:24:49.716
Matty?

1:24:49.750 --> 1:24:50.885
Yeah.

1:24:50.917 --> 1:24:52.719
Well don't you
think that it's fate?

1:24:52.752 --> 1:24:55.555
Us getting our dream home,

1:24:55.588 --> 1:24:58.693
meeting Clare, her daughter
being pregnant at 16,

1:24:58.725 --> 1:25:01.394
that baby's meant to be with us.

1:25:03.631 --> 1:25:04.666
Matty?

1:25:06.466 --> 1:25:08.135
Matty, are you there?

1:25:11.905 --> 1:25:12.873
Matty?

1:25:21.381 --> 1:25:23.150
I got you, you fucker.

1:25:26.654 --> 1:25:28.189
What was that?

1:25:29.756 --> 1:25:30.824
Are you okay?

1:25:35.695 --> 1:25:36.530
Matty?

1:25:37.497 --> 1:25:39.399
I had a shot, Anna.

1:25:39.432 --> 1:25:40.400
Shot at what?

1:25:44.337 --> 1:25:45.372
Just come home.

1:27:18.698 --> 1:27:19.666
Hello?

1:27:19.699 --> 1:27:20.701
Hi, Hannah, I'm Valerie,

1:27:20.734 --> 1:27:21.702
I'm looking for Kristen.

1:27:21.734 --> 1:27:22.869
I'm just

1:27:22.903 --> 1:27:24.505
worried about her.

1:27:24.537 --> 1:27:28.041
Do you have any idea
where she might be?

1:27:28.074 --> 1:27:30.043
No, I haven't seen her.

1:27:30.077 --> 1:27:31.445
I think she's using again.

1:27:55.802 --> 1:27:57.738
Kristen, Valerie's
looking for you.

1:27:57.770 --> 1:28:00.675
She said you're using again.

1:28:00.707 --> 1:28:01.942
Dude.

1:28:01.975 --> 1:28:03.944
What the hell is
going on with you?

1:28:03.976 --> 1:28:05.578
I thought you were clean.

1:28:22.395 --> 1:28:23.496
Call me back, okay?

1:28:24.931 --> 1:28:26.367
I really miss you.

1:28:28.034 --> 1:28:32.405
I'm getting help right
now and you should too,

1:28:32.439 --> 1:28:33.740
before it's too late.

1:28:38.045 --> 1:28:39.880
Okay love you.

1:28:39.912 --> 1:28:40.880
Bye.

1:30:33.627 --> 1:30:34.962
Kristen, I tried
calling you back.

1:30:34.994 --> 1:30:36.096
Where are you?

1:30:37.163 --> 1:30:39.533
I know you're using again.

1:30:40.833 --> 1:30:42.202
I know it's hard.

1:30:42.235 --> 1:30:44.671
And I'm going to come
talk to your mom tomorrow

1:30:44.704 --> 1:30:46.907
and we're going to get you help

1:30:46.939 --> 1:30:49.175
before something
really bad happens.

1:31:54.640 --> 1:31:55.608
Help me!

1:31:56.777 --> 1:31:57.578
It hurts!

1:32:00.247 --> 1:32:01.215
Kristen!

1:32:01.247 --> 1:32:02.082
Kristen!

1:32:05.252 --> 1:32:07.988
Liberty 285, code six.

1:32:08.020 --> 1:32:08.988
105 North Avenue and 52.

1:32:09.021 --> 1:32:11.125
Kristen, where is it?

1:32:11.891 --> 1:32:15.261
Where's
the baby, Kristen?

1:32:15.295 --> 1:32:17.064
Kristen,
can you hear me?

1:32:19.099 --> 1:32:20.067
Yeah.

1:32:20.100 --> 1:32:21.802
Gonna get your blood pressure.

1:32:33.613 --> 1:32:36.583
Kristen, I'm gonna
start an IV, okay?

1:32:38.618 --> 1:32:41.854
Gonna feel a tight band
and then a little poke.

1:32:41.887 --> 1:32:43.623
Okay tight band.

1:32:43.657 --> 1:32:45.159
Why didn't she tell us?

1:32:45.192 --> 1:32:46.159
All right Kristen you're
gonna feel a little pinch.

1:32:47.394 --> 1:32:49.997
I want Kristen to get better.

1:32:50.029 --> 1:32:51.164
It'll be okay.

1:33:02.676 --> 1:33:04.778
Where's
the baby, Kristen?

1:33:04.810 --> 1:33:06.813
You need to back away.

1:33:09.282 --> 1:33:10.117
Kristen.

1:33:11.051 --> 1:33:13.053
Hang in there for us, baby,

1:33:13.086 --> 1:33:14.088
come on, baby you can do it.

1:33:14.121 --> 1:33:15.088
Okay.

1:33:15.122 --> 1:33:16.090
Slow deep breaths.

1:33:16.122 --> 1:33:17.123
Hang in there, baby.

1:33:18.225 --> 1:33:19.660
Mommy?

1:33:37.210 --> 1:33:38.746
457.

1:33:38.779 --> 1:33:40.881
It's gonna be all right.

1:33:40.913 --> 1:33:42.282
Okay?

1:33:42.314 --> 1:33:44.751
Your big sister's gonna be okay.

1:33:44.784 --> 1:33:46.119
Let's get her
hooked to the monitor.

1:33:46.153 --> 1:33:47.954
How did she have a baby?

1:33:47.988 --> 1:33:50.057
I didn't know, I didn't know.

1:33:52.091 --> 1:33:53.092
Excuse me.

1:33:53.126 --> 1:33:54.094
Where is her room?

1:33:54.127 --> 1:33:55.095
Upstairs, to the right.

1:33:55.127 --> 1:33:55.929
First room on the right.

1:33:55.962 --> 1:33:58.265
We can cycle her
blood pressure.

1:34:01.234 --> 1:34:03.771
Kristen, open your eyes.

1:34:03.804 --> 1:34:05.239
Kristen.

1:34:05.271 --> 1:34:07.173
Open your eyes.

1:34:09.775 --> 1:34:10.810
Matty.

1:34:10.844 --> 1:34:12.746
Yeah, what's wrong?

1:34:15.047 --> 1:34:16.215
Where was she last night?

1:34:16.248 --> 1:34:17.083
Here.

1:34:17.117 --> 1:34:18.185
I think.

1:34:18.217 --> 1:34:20.319
What do you mean, you think?

1:34:35.268 --> 1:34:37.003
I didn't
help, I didn't know.

1:34:42.442 --> 1:34:43.810
I didn't know.

1:34:45.177 --> 1:34:47.180
I'm sorry.

1:34:52.284 --> 1:34:53.252
Kristen.

1:34:53.286 --> 1:34:54.354
Where's the baby?

1:34:54.386 --> 1:34:55.889
There's no baby.

1:34:55.921 --> 1:34:57.123
Where's the baby?

1:34:59.225 --> 1:35:00.359
Tell them, Kiki!

1:35:00.393 --> 1:35:02.229
I don't have a baby.

1:35:02.261 --> 1:35:04.230
Where's
the baby, kristen?

Clear.

1:37:42.555 --> 1:37:43.523
Shocking!

1:37:46.559 --> 1:37:49.162

1:38:00.273 --> 1:38:01.341

1:38:01.373 --> 1:38:03.443
Kristen!

1:38:03.475 --> 1:38:04.443
No!

1:38:10.182 --> 1:38:11.150
Kristen.

1:38:11.184 --> 1:38:12.152
Baby.

1:38:12.185 --> 1:38:13.387
Can you hear me?

1:38:13.420 --> 1:38:14.654
Mom, I need
you to step back.

1:38:14.688 --> 1:38:16.222
Clear the bed again,
I'm shocking please.

1:38:18.257 --> 1:38:19.259
Shocking!

1:40:23.582 --> 1:40:26.719
I want this eulogy to matter.

1:40:35.360 --> 1:40:36.462
That should've been me.

1:40:39.298 --> 1:40:40.466
I did this.

1:40:47.372 --> 1:40:48.708
I taught Kristen

1:40:50.109 --> 1:40:52.578
how to shoot heroin
under her tongue.

1:40:52.612 --> 1:40:55.782
And I showed her
where to shoot up.

1:40:55.814 --> 1:40:58.518
To hide the needle marks.

1:40:58.551 --> 1:41:00.620
And I am so sorry.

1:41:03.823 --> 1:41:05.525
The truth is

1:41:05.557 --> 1:41:07.194
that you can be blessed
with a great family,

1:41:07.226 --> 1:41:09.563
and go to a great school,

1:41:09.595 --> 1:41:12.565
and have a lot of
friends and money

1:41:12.599 --> 1:41:15.435
and all these things that
make your life seem perfect.

1:41:15.467 --> 1:41:16.869
But on the inside,

1:41:16.903 --> 1:41:19.239
things can be ugly

1:41:19.271 --> 1:41:20.573
and they can feel

1:41:20.606 --> 1:41:22.676
terrifying and hopeless.

1:41:24.676 --> 1:41:25.511
And it.

1:41:26.445 --> 1:41:27.881
It breaks my heart

1:41:30.182 --> 1:41:32.519
to think that that's
how Kristen felt.

1:41:38.625 --> 1:41:39.693
Like it or not.

1:41:40.859 --> 1:41:43.830
I'm going to tell
you Kristen's story.

1:41:53.640 --> 1:41:56.810
I know Kristen's story
wasn't easy to hear.

1:41:56.842 --> 1:41:58.644
It's a cautionary tale

1:41:59.746 --> 1:42:00.913
like success,

1:42:00.947 --> 1:42:03.516
tragedy leaves clues.

1:42:06.552 --> 1:42:07.386
Some of you

1:42:07.421 --> 1:42:10.624
will see parts of
yourself in Kristen,

1:42:13.458 --> 1:42:15.662
some parents will see
parts of themselves

1:42:15.694 --> 1:42:17.396
in the McKusker Family.

1:42:17.430 --> 1:42:19.298
She's so strong.

1:42:19.332 --> 1:42:22.503
And that awareness
can bring change.

1:42:26.573 --> 1:42:28.240
But help and success

1:42:28.274 --> 1:42:29.676
starts with acceptance

1:42:29.708 --> 1:42:30.711
and talking.

1:42:33.779 --> 1:42:36.282
We can't lose another Kristen.

1:42:36.983 --> 1:42:39.452
And we cannot lose the future.

1:42:39.484 --> 1:42:40.621
Like baby Amari.

1:42:41.854 --> 1:42:44.557
Her name means miracle of God.

1:42:45.692 --> 1:42:47.961
And it's truly a miracle

1:42:47.993 --> 1:42:49.762
that she survived that night

1:42:49.796 --> 1:42:51.731
in the nature preserve.

1:42:52.599 --> 1:42:53.667
If we can save

1:42:53.699 --> 1:42:55.402
just one life

1:42:55.435 --> 1:42:58.371
by telling Kristen's story,

1:43:00.239 --> 1:43:02.708
