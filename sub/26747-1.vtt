a nice girl like you.

18:17.203 --> 18:18.403
Farrokh?

18:18.405 --> 18:20.938
Did Farrokh not tell you
he was born in Zanzibar?

18:20.940 --> 18:23.207
- No, he did not.
- ROGER: I used to know a girl

18:23.209 --> 18:24.575

was born in London.

from Persia...

18:42.694 --> 18:44.327
to escape Muslim persecution.

18:44.329 --> 18:46.529
BRIAN: Really?
That's terrible.

18:46.531 --> 18:48.065

leave Zanzibar?

30:19.058 --> 30:20.958
Ray, this is the

30:20.960 --> 30:22.026
Hello.

30:22.028 --> 30:23.426
You must stop
calling him that.

30:23.428 --> 30:24.327
That's his name.

30:24.329 --> 30:27.163
No, we cannot keep
calling him "Jim Beach."

30:27.165 --> 30:30.703
No, that's absurd, not to
mention, unspeakably boring.

- Do you?
- I do.

FREDDIE: No, don't
misunderstand, darling.

32:17.908 --> 32:19.843
It's a rock and roll record...

32:19.845 --> 32:21.144
with the scale of opera...

32:21.146 --> 32:23.180
the pathos of Greek tragedy...

32:23.182 --> 32:25.449
the wit of Shakespeare...

32:25.451 --> 32:29.486
the unbridled joy
of musical theater.

32:29.488 --> 32:31.888
- It's a musical experience.
- Yeah.

32:31.890 --> 32:33.990
Rather than just
another record.

something...

32:38.496 --> 32:39.563
Hmm.

32:39.565 --> 32:42.231
Something that will make
people feel belongs to them.

We'll mix genres,
we'll cross boundaries...

32:46.638 --> 32:49.538
we'll speak in bloody tongues
if we want to.

There's no musical ghetto
that can contain us.

32:51.609 --> 32:53.410
- That's it.
- No one knows what Queen means

32:53.412 --> 32:55.681
because it doesn't mean
one thing.

What do you think, John?

33:00.586 --> 33:01.687

33:02.288 --> 33:03.586

Of course you do.

Oh, Jesus.

45:00.872 --> 45:02.705
I love it.

45:02.707 --> 45:04.107
Well,
that's the kind of song...

45:04.109 --> 45:06.642

the volume in their car...

45:06.644 --> 45:08.343

45:08.345 --> 45:12.113
<i>Bohemian Rhapsody</i>

45:12.115 --> 45:14.816
It's a band decision,

in the music industry, but...

Say the name Queen,
on the other hand...
