00:35.335 --> 00:36.502
Good morning.
I'm Tom Tucker.

00:36.504 --> 00:38.937
Coming up, we talk
to a man on the street

00:38.939 --> 00:41.373
while a man further back
on the street flips you off.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.109
But first, Quahog was hit by
a major blizzard last night.

00:44.111 --> 00:45.644
Here with more details
on the snowstorm

00:45.646 --> 00:47.479
is Asian correspondent
Tricia Nakahoma.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.415
That's wrong.
That's wrong.

00:49.417 --> 00:51.283
You're not doing
good so far.

00:51.285 --> 00:54.787
I'm standing here surrounded
by snowdrifts, stalled cars,

00:54.789 --> 00:56.922
and the one douchebag
who wears a tank top

00:56.924 --> 00:58.791
every time there's a blizzard.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.025
Yeah, this is nothin'.

01:00.027 --> 01:02.261
Guy at work drank a
quart of motor oil once

01:02.263 --> 01:03.796
and didn't even
die from it.

01:03.798 --> 01:05.697
Put that on the
news, but you won't.

01:05.699 --> 01:07.833
(laughter and excited chatter)

01:08.701 --> 01:10.002
Hey, guys, check it out.

01:10.004 --> 01:12.037
I peed my name in the snow.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.774
Geez, Joe.
That's normal.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.943
Wow, looks like the whole
neighborhood's out here.

01:17.945 --> 01:19.445
Yeah, I just hope
that weird albino

01:19.447 --> 01:21.013
up the street doesn't show up.

01:21.015 --> 01:22.014
That guy creeps me out.

01:22.016 --> 01:23.649
Hello, Peter.
Dah! Dah!

01:23.651 --> 01:25.250
H-Hey. Hey, Bill.

01:25.252 --> 01:27.486
What are you doing out
here in all this snow?

01:27.488 --> 01:29.555
Just taking my rabbit
to the vet.

01:31.591 --> 01:34.093
Well, I'm all done shoveling
your walk, Mr. Herbert.

01:34.095 --> 01:37.963
Thanks, Chris, but
there's some in here, too.

01:37.965 --> 01:39.998
BRIAN: Hey, check
it out-- lemon snow.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.934
What?
Yeah, that stuff's
delicious.

01:41.936 --> 01:44.870
Lemon snow? You mean it just
falls from the sky like that?

01:44.872 --> 01:46.171
You bet. One of nature's treats.

01:46.173 --> 01:48.107
You gonna have some?
Nah, I'm already full.

01:48.109 --> 01:51.143
But you should have some before
the other kids get to it.

01:51.145 --> 01:52.344
What is it?
Like Italian ice?

01:52.346 --> 01:54.446
Yeah, exactly,
like a sorbet.

01:55.782 --> 01:56.982
Ugh! That's not lemon!

01:56.984 --> 01:58.851
No, it's not.
You bastard!

01:58.853 --> 02:01.954
I was having fun playing in the
snow, and now you've ruined it,

02:01.956 --> 02:03.655
like a pizza place
ruins a salad.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.023
Okay, four pizzas
and a salad.

02:05.025 --> 02:06.859
Salad? How do
you make a salad?

02:06.861 --> 02:09.128
First, you throw in
the whole head of lettuce.

02:09.130 --> 02:11.029
Even the hard-to-eat
white part at the bottom?

02:11.031 --> 02:12.865
That's what the people want!
Now, what else?

02:12.867 --> 02:14.700
I got a can of
whole black olives.

02:14.702 --> 02:15.968
Should I slice them up?

02:15.970 --> 02:18.103
What are you, crazy?
No, you keep 'em whole.

02:18.105 --> 02:20.506
You're gonna want to know you've
got an olive in your mouth.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.374
What about this tomato?
Cut it
into thirds.

02:22.376 --> 02:25.144
It should be big enough
to pretend you've got red teeth.

02:25.146 --> 02:26.979
How about this carrot?
Should I cut it up?

02:26.981 --> 02:28.347
Yes, but very thin lengthwise.

02:28.349 --> 02:29.915
The whole length
of the carrot.

02:29.917 --> 02:31.917
One thin slice.
Okay, what else do we got?

02:31.919 --> 02:34.920
Well, we got these hot peppers,
but you can't really eat them.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.188
No problem. Dump 'em all in.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.990
Now, should we
put it in a bowl?

02:37.992 --> 02:40.092
No, let's put it
in a lasagna tray.

02:40.094 --> 02:43.829
Oh, and make sure to stick it
right on top of the pizzas

02:43.831 --> 02:45.531
so it stays nice and warm.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.532
(phone ringing)

02:46.534 --> 02:48.066
Hello, every pizza place.

02:51.004 --> 02:53.539
All right, Stewie, you
all set to spend the day

02:53.541 --> 02:54.806
with Grandma and Grandpa?

02:54.808 --> 02:56.475
Ugh, I hate being around
old people.

02:56.477 --> 02:58.977
They've always got weird stuff
in their refrigerator.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.979
Ah, I'm hungry.
What do we got?

03:00.981 --> 03:04.082
Let's see. Eye drops,
baking soda and some film.

03:04.084 --> 03:05.417
OLD MAN:
Close the door.

03:05.419 --> 03:08.086
You're running up
long distance charges!

03:08.088 --> 03:09.988
(doorbell rings)

03:09.990 --> 03:11.823
Ah, sorry.
Thought I had more time.

03:11.825 --> 03:13.425
Hi, Daddy.
Stewie's all ready.

03:13.427 --> 03:14.927
You boys have fun.

03:14.929 --> 03:16.495

Hey, just so you know, we're not
listening to a radio station.

03:37.017 --> 03:40.018
We're listening to the hiss
between two radio stations.

03:40.020 --> 03:41.853
(tires squealing)

03:41.855 --> 03:43.989
Whoa. Watch your driving!

03:45.425 --> 03:47.492
Is he... Is he sleeping?

03:47.494 --> 03:49.928
Hey! Hey, wake up! Wake up!

03:49.930 --> 03:51.029
You, lady, wake him up!

03:51.031 --> 03:53.498
You like the <i>Tom and Jerry,</i>

03:53.500 --> 03:55.801
Well, we'll dial them up
when we get home.

03:55.803 --> 03:58.170
What the hell are you talking
about?! We're about to...

03:59.939 --> 04:01.173
(groans)

04:01.175 --> 04:02.474
What happened?

04:02.476 --> 04:04.443
Where are my
knitting needles?

04:06.679 --> 04:09.014
(gasps)
Goodness, dear, I'm so sorry.

04:09.016 --> 04:11.250
No worries.
Now I can work at Hot Topic

04:11.252 --> 04:13.685
and make people sick
as I ring up their purchases.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.821

04:21.761 --> 04:24.029
Oh, damn it.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.530
Dude, bad news.

04:25.532 --> 04:26.932
You're dead.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.500
What? But I'm Death!

04:28.502 --> 04:30.135
Sorry, dude.
Super Death.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.536
You're done.

04:31.538 --> 04:33.171
So what now?
I go to Heaven?

04:33.173 --> 04:35.507
Nope, when a Death dies,
he gets reincarnated.

04:35.509 --> 04:39.711
You're being reincarnated as
a Chinese baby right... now!

04:39.713 --> 04:41.980
(whirring)

04:41.982 --> 04:44.016
Girl?
Girl.

04:44.984 --> 04:46.585
Oh, no!

04:46.587 --> 04:49.087
The egg that I was supposed
to take care of

04:49.089 --> 04:50.756
for my high school project!

04:50.758 --> 04:52.157
Mr. Burke was right.

04:52.159 --> 04:54.293
I'm not ready to be a parent.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.661
Wait a minute.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.162
I'm not in high school anymore.

04:57.164 --> 04:59.531
Maybe this is all a dream.

04:59.533 --> 05:01.933
Aah! It <i>was</i> a dream!

05:01.935 --> 05:03.935
I need a glass of water.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.270
Wait a minute.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.706
I moved out of the desert
years ago.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.608
Maybe <i>this</i> is a dream!

05:09.610 --> 05:11.443
Aah!

05:11.445 --> 05:12.878
Phew.

05:12.880 --> 05:15.747
I  <i>am</i>ready
to be a parent, Mr. Burke.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.520
Daddy, I'm so happy
you're all right.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.355
We're lucky
it wasn't more serious.

05:23.357 --> 05:25.590
Hey, how's
the old guy doing?

05:25.592 --> 05:26.925
Ugh, now here's Joe.

05:26.927 --> 05:28.927
Why is everybody
we know depressing?

05:28.929 --> 05:31.830
Mr. Pewterschmidt, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.965
I'm gonna have to revoke
your driver's license.

05:33.967 --> 05:35.200
What?!

05:35.202 --> 05:37.636
It's obvious your advanced age
has impaired your ability

05:37.638 --> 05:38.870
to drive safely.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.939
Please, Joe,
I know he had

05:40.941 --> 05:42.808
but can't
you look the
other way

05:42.810 --> 05:44.309

as a friend?

05:44.311 --> 05:46.411
Yeah, you know, Joe,
you owe this family.

Joe, open the garage.

06:14.007 --> 06:16.641
I've earned this private time!

06:16.643 --> 06:18.176
Listen, I don't
have time for this.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.645
I'm late for a hostile
takeover of a jelly factory.

06:20.647 --> 06:22.347
I'll show those Smuckers.

06:22.349 --> 06:24.750
That's fine,
but you can't drive.

Oh, don't be
ridiculous!

06:25.953 --> 06:27.686
Driver Pete at
your service, sir.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.488
Peter, we're not
doing that.
Aw.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.590
Carter, you work
too much as it is.

06:31.592 --> 06:33.458
You're not a young
man anymore.

06:33.460 --> 06:34.860
You need to slow down.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.862
Slow down?! I
can't slow down.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.497
I'm running a six-billion-
dollar company.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.799
If I slow down, the
company goes under.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.501
It just seems
to me that perhaps

06:42.503 --> 06:45.170
it's time to think
about retirement.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.038
Never! Retirement's
for old people.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.840
I can work till I die.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.008
Maybe even after that.

06:50.010 --> 06:51.676
Mr. Pewterschmidt, the
gentlemen from Zurich

06:51.678 --> 06:53.745
are here for your 10:00.

06:55.982 --> 06:58.116
Will you need
anything else?

06:58.118 --> 07:00.152
Mr. Pewterschmidt!

07:00.154 --> 07:02.587
But, dear, we <i>are</i> old.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.990
We can't keep pretending
that nothing's changed.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.793
I mean, we almost injured
our grandchild today.

07:07.795 --> 07:09.528
Besides, you're always
complaining

07:09.530 --> 07:12.130
that you don't have
enough time to play polo

07:12.132 --> 07:14.866
or sit in a chair
and moisten your mouth.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.134
That is true.

07:16.136 --> 07:19.104
It does sometimes take me
a while to moisten my mouth.

07:25.912 --> 07:27.979
There we go, all moist.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.181
You see, dear?

07:29.183 --> 07:30.615
And that's only
the beginning.

07:30.617 --> 07:33.118
Retirement will be
a wonderful adventure,

07:33.120 --> 07:34.186
and we'll do it together.

07:34.188 --> 07:35.620
You're gonna retire?

07:35.622 --> 07:36.822
From what?

07:36.824 --> 07:38.623
There, isn't it fun already?

07:38.625 --> 07:39.958
(sighs)

07:39.960 --> 07:42.461
Okay. I'll retire.

07:42.463 --> 07:45.030
Oh, Daddy, I think
that's for the best.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.899
I need a doctor!
Is there a doctor?!

07:54.040 --> 07:56.875
ANNOUNCER: We now return to
<i>The Superfriends' Accountant.</i>

07:56.877 --> 07:58.510
Look, you guys
are hemorrhaging money.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.812
This Hall of Justice is sitting
on five acres

08:00.814 --> 08:02.013
of commercial real estate.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.081
How do you afford this?

08:03.083 --> 08:04.316
We're the Superfriends.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.151
Yeah, but you guys
have no income.

08:06.153 --> 08:08.587
You owe four million dollars
in back property taxes.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.355
We fight evil
wherever we find it.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.123
Well, that's not
gonna be enough.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.758
Look, you may
need to reach out

08:13.760 --> 08:15.994
to some wealthy benefactors
for financial backing.

08:15.996 --> 08:17.963
Do any of you know
billionaire Bruce Wayne?

08:17.965 --> 08:19.164
No. None of us do.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.000
And he wouldn't want to lend
us money anyway... I hear.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.335
Hey, hey, hey!

08:23.337 --> 08:25.971
What's up, Ginas...
'g-'ginas... vaginas?

08:25.973 --> 08:26.938
What's up,
vaginas?!

08:26.940 --> 08:28.173
Ah-ha, gotcha!

08:28.175 --> 08:30.008
Mr. Pewterschmidt,
what are you doing here?

08:30.010 --> 08:32.677
I'm retired now. Got
a lot of free time.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.446
So what do
you guys
do here?

08:34.448 --> 08:37.015
Well, we usually just sit here
and complain about our lives.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.451
Like this morning, Lois was such
a pain in the ass...

08:39.453 --> 08:41.620
Hey! That's my daughter
you're talking about!

08:41.622 --> 08:44.489
Oh. I mean this, um,
redheaded lady

08:44.491 --> 08:48.026
who lives in my bed was a real
pain in the ass this morning.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.794
Oh, she sounds like a bitch.

08:49.796 --> 08:50.962
Yeah, what a bitch.

08:50.964 --> 08:51.997
Bitchazoid, right, guys?

08:51.999 --> 08:53.698
Yeah. I hope you're doing her.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.599
Oh, big time.

08:54.601 --> 08:56.134
Yeah, that's hot.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.769
That's hot. I'm gonna think
about that tonight.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.804
Oh, we do all kinds
of crazy stuff.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.506
Sometimes
we even have phone sax.

09:01.508 --> 09:03.008
Don't you mean
phone <i>sex?</i>

09:03.010 --> 09:04.576
No, Joe.
Phone <i>sax.</i>

09:04.578 --> 09:05.977
Are you ready?

09:05.979 --> 09:07.812
You better believe it.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.915
(playing "Baker Street")

09:15.688 --> 09:17.422
Oh, Peter!

09:17.424 --> 09:19.658
Yeah. Now your turn.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.259
And do it how I like.

09:21.261 --> 09:23.628
(giggles)
Okay.

09:23.630 --> 09:25.864
(playing intro to
"You Can Call Me Al")

09:30.870 --> 09:34.105
Yeah. Don't wash
the mouthpiece.

09:36.976 --> 09:38.743
Good news, guys.

09:38.745 --> 09:39.945
Now that Grandpa's retired,

09:39.947 --> 09:42.113
he's gonna have more time
to spend with us.

09:42.115 --> 09:43.281
ALL:
Oh!

09:43.283 --> 09:44.849
We don't want to do that, Mom.

09:44.851 --> 09:46.985
Yeah, all he ever does is
ask you what you want to do

09:46.987 --> 09:49.087
so he can shoot it down and
tell you what he wants to do.

09:49.089 --> 09:50.322
Hey, there's
my family!

09:50.324 --> 09:52.591
So, what do you guys
want to do today?

09:52.593 --> 09:54.426
I'd like to go
to the mall, Grandpa.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.594
No parking at the mall.

09:55.596 --> 09:57.095
It's a terrible place.
What else?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.096
Um, how about
the zoo?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.531
Too much walking.
Too much noise.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.099
You can't have
any good conversation.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.200
Not like at Chili's.
Where else?

10:02.202 --> 10:03.468
Well, there's always the beach.

10:03.470 --> 10:05.704
No, you got to sit
on the ground to eat.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.939
I need a cushioned chair with
back support like at Chili's.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.575
Okay, well...
how about Chili's?

10:10.577 --> 10:12.077
Maybe, maybe.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.812
Let's get in the car
and see where it takes us.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.982
(rings doorbell)

10:16.984 --> 10:18.583
Hey, Carter.

10:18.585 --> 10:19.851
Hello, Quandary.

10:19.853 --> 10:20.919
It's, uh...
It's Quagmire.

10:20.921 --> 10:22.454
You looking for Peter?

10:22.456 --> 10:23.788
No, he's at work. Lame.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.290
Oh. Well, what
do you want?

10:25.292 --> 10:27.092
I hear you're kind of
a cool guy.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.827
Thought maybe
we could hang out.

10:28.829 --> 10:29.961
Uh... okay.

10:29.963 --> 10:32.030
Okay! Carter and Quandary,
hanging out.

10:32.032 --> 10:35.266
All right, I just got to go take
a misty, stop-and-go piss

10:35.268 --> 10:37.769
in your bathroom,
then we'll be good to go.

10:42.508 --> 10:45.777
Lois, how the hell much
longer is your dad gonna
be hanging around here?

10:45.779 --> 10:48.113
He's starting
to drive me crazy.
(sighs)
I know, Peter,

10:48.115 --> 10:50.782
but he's my father and I
don't know what else to do.

10:50.784 --> 10:52.851
Well, I don't know how
much more I can take.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.853
I can't even get
any sleep with him here.

10:56.455 --> 10:57.856
Hey.

10:57.858 --> 11:00.025
Hey.
Wha-Wha-Wha-Wha-
What is it?

11:00.027 --> 11:02.494
I can't sleep.
I'm scared of ghosts.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.696
Carter, there's
no such thing as ghosts.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.131
Are you sure?

11:06.133 --> 11:08.600
Well, <i>now</i> I'm not.
Come on, get in here!

11:09.535 --> 11:10.835
It's safe under
here, right?

11:10.837 --> 11:12.437
I think so,
but I'm not sure.

11:12.439 --> 11:15.073
I just recently started
believing in ghosts.

11:17.677 --> 11:19.477
Hi, Mom. Hi, Daddy.

11:19.479 --> 11:22.080
Lois! What are
you two doing here?

11:22.082 --> 11:24.349
Well, we wanted to talk
to you about something.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.650
Hmm. What's that?

11:25.652 --> 11:26.918
Well, we were just thinking,

11:26.920 --> 11:29.921
now that Daddy's retired
that you and he might be happier

11:29.923 --> 11:32.991
in a place where you can be
with people your own age.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.093
You know, make some new friends.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.996
What are you talking about?
Well, we actually
brought you a few brochures

11:37.998 --> 11:40.532
of some lovely retirement
communities in Florida.

11:40.534 --> 11:42.133
And I helped.

11:42.135 --> 11:45.203
Florida?!
Mm, this one's even
got the word "sunset"

11:45.205 --> 11:47.105
four times in
the name of it.

11:47.107 --> 11:49.674
Huh. These people are
biking without helmets.

11:49.676 --> 11:51.676
Must be a pretty
kick-back place.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.411
These actually
look quite nice,

11:53.413 --> 11:56.781
and we could finally get away
from these dreadful winters.

11:56.783 --> 11:58.950
Yeah. We'll even help you
move in and get settled.

11:58.952 --> 12:01.186
Wait a minute, why would
I want to live in Florida?

12:01.188 --> 12:02.987
Black people's votes go
right in the garbage.

12:02.989 --> 12:04.622
All right!
We're moving to Florida!

12:04.624 --> 12:06.925
Oh, Carter,
this is wonderful!

12:06.927 --> 12:08.860
Aw, look at
that smile, Lois.

12:08.862 --> 12:12.464
Reminds of that guy
who was way too happy he
didn't get killed on 9/11.

12:12.466 --> 12:15.100
(gasping):
I'm ten minutes
late for work!

12:15.102 --> 12:17.035
Look at that!
I stayed up late

12:17.037 --> 12:19.671
watching <i>Monday Night Football</i>
<i>and that saved my life, huh?</i>

12:19.673 --> 12:20.972
Isn't that awesome?

12:20.974 --> 12:23.174
Oh, but oh...

12:30.783 --> 12:31.950
Hi there. Welcome.

12:31.952 --> 12:34.085
I'm Ryan, the manager
here at Oceanside,

12:34.087 --> 12:35.954
and I'll be showing
you around today.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.355
First question, though:

12:37.357 --> 12:39.791
are you two old enough
to be here?

12:39.793 --> 12:40.992
(giggles):
Oh, dear!

12:40.994 --> 12:42.961
(laughs)
I like you, Ryan.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.028
You're cool.

12:48.134 --> 12:51.169
Over there is our statue

too hot and too cold,

I'll tell you what, Babs,
let me have a talk with him.

14:31.804 --> 14:32.937
Hey there, buddy.

14:32.939 --> 14:34.239
Go away!

14:34.241 --> 14:37.108
You know, you remind
me of a guy I know.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.944
This guy worked and worked
and never wanted to retire,

14:39.946 --> 14:42.914
even though it would've been
the best thing for him.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.983
You know what that
man's name was?

14:44.985 --> 14:47.051
Jon Benet Ramsey.

14:47.987 --> 14:49.354
I-I-I think.

14:49.356 --> 14:50.822
I think that's the guy.

14:50.824 --> 14:52.790
What?
You're darn
right what.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.592
Now, let's get
back in there.

14:54.594 --> 14:57.161
Peter, get lost!
I'm not gonna retire,

Come on, Carter, everybody's
got to retire at some point.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.200

with Alzheimer's.

15:03.135 --> 15:04.869
Looks like we got
a joker here.

What's your
name, soldier?

15:06.406 --> 15:07.972
Sir, McArdle, sir!

15:07.974 --> 15:08.907
Well, no (bleep)!

15:08.909 --> 15:11.576

15:49.416 --> 15:50.515
Eh, that's a sucker's bet.

15:50.517 --> 15:52.250
There's only one way
to win this game--

wait for someone else to win

Yeah, I hated that.

very own thermostat

glad you finally came
around about this place.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.766
Peter, I got to admit,
it's not bad at all.

17:14.768 --> 17:16.601
Never thought I'd get
used to the idea

17:16.603 --> 17:19.337

devoting my life to leisure.

17:27.981 --> 17:29.914
You don't want
to meet those people.

17:29.916 --> 17:31.015
(doorbell rings)

17:31.017 --> 17:33.017
Hi. I just moved
into the neighborhood,

17:33.019 --> 17:36.788
and I'm required by
law to inform you that
I am a sex offender.

17:36.790 --> 17:38.656
Oh, don't worry
about it-- so am I.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.191
This whole block
is S.O.'s.

17:40.193 --> 17:43.194
We use the abbreviation "S.O's"
because it saves a lot of time

17:43.196 --> 17:45.930
over saying "Sex
Offender," because
that's all we talk about.

17:45.932 --> 17:47.932
Well, I'm also into football.
Don't care.

17:47.934 --> 17:50.802
No time for F.B.
All about S.O.

17:50.804 --> 17:54.138
Make no mistake, Florida
is the South's trash can.

17:58.310 --> 18:00.278
Boy, these eggs
are delicious.

18:00.280 --> 18:01.746
Good job, Lois.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.314
Good job, local hen.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.183
Aw, bucka bucka baw.

18:05.185 --> 18:07.118
(phone rings)

18:07.120 --> 18:08.820
Hello?

18:08.822 --> 18:10.154
Hi, Mom.

18:10.156 --> 18:11.355
What?

18:11.357 --> 18:13.091
Oh, my God!

18:13.093 --> 18:16.160
Oh, my God, o-okay, we'll be
down there as soon as we can.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.462
Mom, what's wrong?

18:17.464 --> 18:19.030
We're going
to Florida.

18:19.032 --> 18:22.700
There's something horribly wrong
with your grandpa.

18:28.307 --> 18:29.674
Oh, Lois!

18:29.676 --> 18:31.776
I'm so glad
you made it.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.011
He's been like this for days.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.613
Oh, my God!

18:35.615 --> 18:36.814
(grumbling)

18:36.816 --> 18:38.182
...cream of wheat.

18:38.184 --> 18:39.484
(mumbling)

18:39.486 --> 18:40.651
<i>...Jeopardy.</i>

18:40.653 --> 18:42.120
(mumbling)

18:42.122 --> 18:43.855
...butterscotch pudding.

18:43.857 --> 18:44.956
This is awful!

18:44.958 --> 18:46.290
What's happened to him?

18:46.292 --> 18:48.025
I don't know, dear.

18:48.027 --> 18:51.095
He sleeps 18 hours a day,
he refuses to bathe,

18:51.097 --> 18:53.164
and he's stopped
making any sense.

18:53.166 --> 18:56.767
Aw, that sounds like
the sad little fat girl
who lives in all of us

18:56.769 --> 18:58.002
and is struggling
to get out.

18:58.004 --> 18:59.837
(muffled grunts)

18:59.839 --> 19:01.739
Did my parents
call yet?

19:01.741 --> 19:03.641
Nobody's looking for you!
Now, stay in there!

19:03.643 --> 19:05.843
Sometimes she tries
to get out the other way.

19:05.845 --> 19:08.012
That's why I keep
a cork in my bum.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.447
Daddy?

19:09.449 --> 19:11.415
Daddy, can you hear me?

19:11.417 --> 19:14.085
Oh, God, we should never
have brought him here.

19:14.087 --> 19:14.986
You're right, dear.

19:14.988 --> 19:17.455
I can't stand
to see him like this.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.956
Well, we got
to do something.

19:18.958 --> 19:21.826
Don't worry, you guys, I think
I might know how to fix this.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.929
But first look-- I turned
him into Groucho Marx.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.498
That's hilarious.

19:30.569 --> 19:32.970
Peter, what is this
supposed to accomplish?

19:32.972 --> 19:34.939
Don't you see, Lois?
When we forced him to retire,

19:34.941 --> 19:36.908
we took all the challenge
out of his life.

19:36.910 --> 19:39.677
Perhaps some people aren't
meant to retire at all.

19:39.679 --> 19:43.014
Exactly! Now, let's see if we
can put some fire back into him.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.917
Margot, it's time to take this
company in a new direction--

19:45.919 --> 19:48.853
starting with being honest with
the IRS about our profits.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.922
(mumbling)

19:50.924 --> 19:53.457
We're also gonna stop
reading employee e-mails.

19:53.459 --> 19:56.093
(mumbling)
...our servers.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.929
And from now on it's
against the rules

19:57.931 --> 19:59.964
to pat female employees
on the fanny.

19:59.966 --> 20:02.733
(mumbling):
...like touching butts!

20:02.735 --> 20:04.936
And tell the
African-American
elevator attendant

20:04.938 --> 20:06.837
he no longer has to
wear white gloves.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.840
Why don't you just tell him
he can sleep with my wife, too?!

20:09.842 --> 20:10.908
Daddy!

20:10.910 --> 20:12.510
Oh, Carter!
You're back!

20:12.512 --> 20:14.078
You're damn
right I am!

20:14.080 --> 20:18.082
Don't you ever try to
stick me in one of those
retirement places again!

20:18.084 --> 20:21.652
I plan on sitting
behind this desk
until the day I die.

20:21.654 --> 20:23.688
Getting old is right
for some people,

20:23.690 --> 20:25.856
but not for me.
I know, Daddy.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.125
You were right,
and we're sorry.

20:28.127 --> 20:30.127
(phone rings)

20:30.129 --> 20:31.629
Hey, Mom.

20:31.631 --> 20:33.998
No, Mom, you're staying
in the nursing home.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.133
I... I don't care.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.735
I-I don't care.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.471
M-Mom, believe me, no one
is touching you in your sleep.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.006
'Cause you're gross.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.674
And even if they are, so what,
who are you saving yourself for?

20:43.676 --> 20:45.009
Hey, look, I-I got to go.
I don't know if we're coming

20:45.011 --> 20:45.943
to Thanksgiving.
Because I don't know!

20:45.945 --> 20:47.912
She's staying in there.
I know.
