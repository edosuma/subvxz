00:04.134 --> 00:06.571
MEI-LI:

00:06.571 --> 00:08.878
NO! XIAO! UH!

00:08.878 --> 00:10.053
NO!

00:11.098 --> 00:12.577
HUH UH! HUH UH!

00:12.577 --> 00:14.840
MEI-LI: UHH!

00:14.840 --> 00:16.494
UH!

00:16.494 --> 00:18.888
AGH...OH...

00:18.888 --> 00:20.324
MAMA--

00:20.324 --> 00:21.847
MAMA, PUT
SOME PRESSURE--

00:21.847 --> 00:23.110
OHH!

00:23.110 --> 00:25.025
I CALLED RYAN.
HE'S ON HIS WAY.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.243
MAMA?

00:26.243 --> 00:27.853
YOUR PAPA.
YOUR PAPA.

00:27.853 --> 00:28.985
I'LL GET SOME ICE.
HOLD ON.

00:28.985 --> 00:29.986
YEAH. I'M OK.
I'M STANDING.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.118
SEE? I'M OK.

00:31.118 --> 00:34.164
YAH! HAH! UH!
HUH! UH!

00:34.164 --> 00:37.254
OH, MY GOD. MOM. MAMA.

00:37.254 --> 00:38.734
MEI-LI: RYAN...

00:38.734 --> 00:40.475
NOT TOO DEEP,
BUT YOU'LL NEED STITCHES.

00:40.475 --> 00:41.954
ONE MOMENT,
SHE WAS PEI-LING,

00:41.954 --> 00:43.434
AND THEN
ALL OF A SUDDEN...

00:43.434 --> 00:44.870
HOW'D XIAO GET OUT?

00:44.870 --> 00:47.569
WE TRAPPED HER
IN THE HARVESTER'S BLADE.

00:49.049 --> 00:51.747
I'LL HIDE IT,
PROTECT IT.

00:51.747 --> 00:55.359
NICKY,
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:55.359 --> 00:58.058
I THINK
HE DID THIS.

00:58.841 --> 01:01.496
BO?

01:03.933 --> 01:05.239
WATCH THEM.

01:05.239 --> 01:08.329
KEEP THEM SAFE
IN CASE XIAO COMES BACK.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.042
SHIFU.

01:26.042 --> 01:28.827
HEH. MY SON.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.655
IT'S YOUR TRUE FACE.

01:30.655 --> 01:33.484
HOW? I THOUGHT
YOU'D BE IN PEI-LING.

01:33.484 --> 01:36.096
I AM.
I'M NOT REALLY HERE.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.054
MY SPIRIT IS FREE
FROM THE CELL

01:38.054 --> 01:39.795
TRAPPED
IN PEI-LING'S MIND.

01:39.795 --> 01:43.451
NOW WE CAN COMMUNICATE
LIKE WE USED TO--

01:43.451 --> 01:46.018
TRAVELER
TO TRAVELER.

01:46.018 --> 01:49.718
WE'LL MEET IN PERSON
SOON ENOUGH,

01:49.718 --> 01:52.242
BUT I HAVE ONE
FINAL TASK FOR YOU.

01:52.242 --> 01:55.550
WHAT? I FREED YOU
FROM THE BLADE.

01:55.550 --> 01:58.248
I BETRAYED EVERYONE.
I CAN'T STICK AROUND.

01:58.248 --> 02:00.250
YOU SAID ONCE YOU TOOK
PEI-LING, WE'D BE DONE,

02:00.250 --> 02:01.817
WE'D RELEASE THE SOULS
THAT I REAPED.

02:01.817 --> 02:04.689
I CANNOT RELEASE THEM
UNTIL I AM FREE,

02:04.689 --> 02:06.822
FREE TO TRAVEL.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.433
YOUR HU SHEN FU--

02:09.433 --> 02:10.608
HMM.

02:10.608 --> 02:12.654
I'VE NOT HAD IT
SINCE MY DEATH,

02:12.654 --> 02:14.221
BUT I CAN
FEEL ITS PULL.

02:14.221 --> 02:15.657
I KNOW IT'S CLOSE.

02:15.657 --> 02:17.441
UNTIL I CAN
TRAVEL AGAIN,

02:17.441 --> 02:19.095
I'M VULNERABLE
TO THOSE

02:19.095 --> 02:20.923
WHO WISH TO TRAP
MY SPIRIT.

02:20.923 --> 02:22.794
YOU MEAN NICKY.

02:22.794 --> 02:25.928
BETRAYING HER
WAS HARD FOR YOU,

02:25.928 --> 02:27.582
BUT I TOLD YOU,

02:27.582 --> 02:30.802
NICKY DESTROYED
THE SOURCE REALM.

02:30.802 --> 02:32.500
SHE IS THE REASON
WHY ALL THOSE SOULS

02:32.500 --> 02:35.111
WERE LOST, BANISHED
TO THE WASTELAND.

02:35.111 --> 02:37.157
WHEN NICKY REALIZES
WHAT I DID,

02:37.157 --> 02:38.767
SHE'S GOING
TO COME FOR ME.

02:38.767 --> 02:43.206
THEN MOVE
QUICKLY, HMM?

02:43.206 --> 02:44.773
TSK TSK. TSK TSK.

02:44.773 --> 02:48.994
WHEN YOU WERE LOST,
SCARED, ALONE,

02:48.994 --> 02:50.953
I FOUND YOU.

02:50.953 --> 02:53.216
I SAVED YOU.

02:53.216 --> 02:58.178
DO NOT FORGET
WHAT YOU OWE ME.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.745
I WILL NOT
FAIL YOU.

03:10.451 --> 03:11.930
MEI-LI: OK.
ONE SECOND NOW.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.150
MAMA, JUST PUT
SOME PRESSURE ON IT.

03:14.150 --> 03:15.891
MEI-LI:
AH! AH! AH!

03:15.891 --> 03:17.849
ALL RIGHT. SEE? I'M OK.
SEE? I'M STANDING UP STRAIGHT.

03:17.849 --> 03:20.112
YOU THINK NICKY WILL
BE ABLE TO FIND HER?

03:20.112 --> 03:21.505
HOW?

03:21.505 --> 03:22.680
XIAO COULD JUST
TRAVEL AWAY, RIGHT?

03:22.680 --> 03:24.943
SHE'S PROBABLY
LONG GONE.

03:27.250 --> 03:29.861
WHERE'S MY SISTER?

03:38.261 --> 03:40.220
I'M SORRY.

03:40.220 --> 03:42.744
I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY SHE WENT AFTER YOU.

03:42.744 --> 03:45.225
JUST BECAUSE...
XIAO'S EVIL.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.574
IT WAS SOMETHING ELSE.

03:46.574 --> 03:49.316
WHEN SHE CUT ME,
SHE TASTED MY BLOOD.

03:49.316 --> 03:50.882
- SHE WHAT?
- YEAH.

03:50.882 --> 03:54.538
SHE SAID THERE WAS
SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT ME.

04:00.588 --> 04:02.154
DO YOU
REALLY THINK BO

04:02.154 --> 04:03.721
WAS HELPING XIAO
THIS WHOLE TIME?

04:03.721 --> 04:07.638
I HAD MY DOUBTS,
BUT HE FOOLED ME.

04:07.638 --> 04:09.336
HE FOOLED
ALL OF US.

04:09.336 --> 04:11.686
HEY, WHERE'S ZHILAN?

04:51.334 --> 04:52.988
UGH!

04:52.988 --> 04:54.294
UH!

05:29.851 --> 05:31.940
HEY.

05:31.940 --> 05:33.333
HENRY.
MY PARENTS--

05:33.333 --> 05:34.638
THEY'RE FINE.

05:34.638 --> 05:36.161
NO. XIAO. SHE'S
STILL OUT THERE.

05:36.161 --> 05:39.208
EVAN HAD NADIA REACTIVATE
THE BOLO ON PEI-LING.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.384
COPS CAUGHT XIAO
ON CAMERA

05:41.384 --> 05:43.865
LEAVING THE CITY
ON A FREIGHT TRAIN.

05:43.865 --> 05:48.348
SHE'S IN THE WIND, BUT
AT LEAST SHE'S OUT OF TOWN.

05:49.436 --> 05:50.741
YOU OK?

05:53.004 --> 05:54.528
NICKY, WHAT
HAPPENED LAST NIGHT,

05:54.528 --> 05:56.007
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

05:56.007 --> 05:58.445
NO. I LET BO IN.
I GAVE HIM THE BLADE.

05:58.445 --> 06:01.622
I WAS THERE, TOO.
WE BOTH DID.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.453
FOUND THAT.

06:13.416 --> 06:14.678
BO'S A HARVESTER.

06:14.678 --> 06:16.506
CAN YOU USE
YOUR COMPASS POWER,

06:16.506 --> 06:18.378
TRACK HIM SOMEHOW?

06:18.378 --> 06:20.554
I ALREADY TRIED.
I GOT NOTHING ON HIM.

06:20.554 --> 06:23.513
OK. THEN WE FIND HIM
THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY.

06:23.513 --> 06:26.473
THIS IS EVERYTHING BO
USED TO BUILD HIS COVER.

06:26.473 --> 06:27.865
AND WHEN
WE FIND HIM?

06:27.865 --> 06:30.955
WE USE HIM
TO GET PEI-LING BACK.

06:35.482 --> 06:38.789
MEI-LI, NICE
TO HAVE YOU BACK.

06:38.789 --> 06:40.922
YOUR ARM.
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:40.922 --> 06:44.578
OH. IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S JUST A CUT.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.884
DID YOU NEED
SOMETHING?

06:46.884 --> 06:48.408
MY PLATE'S BEEN
PRETTY FULL

06:48.408 --> 06:49.931
NOW THAT
I'M DOWN A CHEF.

06:49.931 --> 06:52.760
HMM. WELL, WE ARE
RUNNING OUT OF TIME

06:52.760 --> 06:54.544
ON THOSE
PACKAGING AGREEMENTS.

06:54.544 --> 06:55.545
NO. THEY'RE SIGNED.

06:55.545 --> 06:56.938
THEY'RE ON YOUR DESK,

06:56.938 --> 06:58.592
BUT I STILL NEED
TO APPROVE THE DUMPLINGS.

06:58.592 --> 07:00.724
THEY CAME IN 3 DAYS AGO.
YOU WEREN'T HERE.

07:00.724 --> 07:03.988
NO. I HAVEN'T
TASTED THEM YET.

07:03.988 --> 07:05.729
THE DEAL WITH
THE GROCERY CHAINS

07:05.729 --> 07:07.296
WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE SIGNED

07:07.296 --> 07:08.906
AND PROCESSED ALREADY.

07:08.906 --> 07:10.691
YOUR COMPANY IS NOT
ALLOWED TO MARKET

07:10.691 --> 07:12.649
ANY PRODUCT FROM THE
HARMONY DUMPLINGS BRAND

07:12.649 --> 07:14.564
WITHOUT
MY SIGN-OFF.

07:14.564 --> 07:17.915
SAMPLES ARE
IN THE FREEZER.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.703
FAKE I.D.s,
FORGED EMPLOYMENT HISTORIES,

07:22.703 --> 07:24.487
NEW BANK ACCOUNTS--

07:24.487 --> 07:25.619
HIS FIRST NAME
WAS THE ONLY THING

07:25.619 --> 07:27.098
HE WASN'T
LYING ABOUT.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.578
WE HAVE TO FIND XIAO,
AND RIGHT NOW,

07:28.578 --> 07:29.797
FINDING BO
IS OUR BEST SHOT.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.189
APARTMENT
BUILDINGS?

07:31.189 --> 07:32.756
FROM WHEN HE FIRST
GOT TO OAKLAND.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.977
THESE PHOTOS WERE
TAKEN WITH A zPHONE 8.

07:35.977 --> 07:38.588
UH, SEE THESE
TINY, WHITE DOTS?

07:38.588 --> 07:39.937
DEAD PIXELS.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.504
ZINDLE RUSHED THE RELEASE
OF THE zPHONE 8,

07:41.504 --> 07:42.984
RESULTING
IN THIS GLITCH.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.855
YEAH. I REMEMBER.
THEY RECALLED THOSE FAST.

07:44.855 --> 07:46.640
WHICH MADE
THEM RARE.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.032
ONLY A FEW PEOPLE
STILL HAVE THESE.

07:48.032 --> 07:49.904
BUT BO DOESN'T
HAVE A zPHONE

07:49.904 --> 07:51.340
UNLESS HE USED
A BURNER.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.733
MM-HMM, AND IF
HE'S STILL USING IT,

07:52.733 --> 07:54.343
I CAN SEE
IF ANY zPHONE 8S

07:54.343 --> 07:56.867
PINGED OFF LOCAL TOWERS,
USE THAT TO I.D. HIS PHONE.

07:56.867 --> 07:58.782
OH, IF I CAN DO THAT,
I PROBABLY CAN FIND

07:58.782 --> 08:00.523
BO'S CURRENT LOCATION.

08:00.523 --> 08:02.699
UH, ALTHEA...

08:02.699 --> 08:05.963
RIGHT. SORRY.
GOT EXCITED.

08:05.963 --> 08:07.835
I'LL WALK YOU
THROUGH IT.

08:17.018 --> 08:18.236
WELL?

08:18.236 --> 08:19.977
YOU CANNOT
SELL THESE,

08:19.977 --> 08:22.023
NOT WITH
MY NAME ON THEM.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.851
ERIC MILLER SAID
OUR TEST KITCHEN

08:23.851 --> 08:25.853
SPENT WEEKS
ON THOSE.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.942
HE'S THE HEAD OF
OUR RETAIL DIVISION.

08:27.942 --> 08:29.552
HE'S OVERSEEING
THE LAUNCH.

08:29.552 --> 08:31.685
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT
TO MR. MILLER,

08:31.685 --> 08:33.817
THIS IS NOT
MY COOKING.

08:33.817 --> 08:36.211
WELL, THEY DID
THE BEST THEY COULD.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.647
KEEP IN MIND
THAT WE HAVE

08:37.647 --> 08:40.215
A 10-CENT-APIECE
MANUFACTURING TARGET.

08:40.215 --> 08:42.347
I CAN DO BETTER.

08:42.347 --> 08:44.262
- AT COST?
- AT COST.

08:46.961 --> 08:49.180
FINE, BUT WE'RE ALREADY
BEHIND SCHEDULE,

08:49.180 --> 08:50.617
AND I'M NOT GONNA
JEOPARDIZE OUR DEAL

08:50.617 --> 08:51.879
WITH THE
GROCERY STORES,

08:51.879 --> 08:54.011
SO YOU HAVE
TILL END OF DAY

08:54.011 --> 08:56.013
TO COME UP WITH
THIS BETTER DUMPLING,

08:56.013 --> 08:58.102
OR WE HAVE TO MOVE ON
WITH WHAT WE'VE GOT.

09:04.892 --> 09:07.677
- HEY, GREAT TO SEE YOU.
- AND YOU.

09:07.677 --> 09:10.201
HEY, EVERYONE, THANK YOU
SO MUCH FOR COMING.

09:10.201 --> 09:12.029
HI, HI. HEY, HARPER.

09:12.029 --> 09:14.118
MAN, GREAT
TURNOUT, RIGHT?

09:14.118 --> 09:15.685
OOH, YEP.

09:15.685 --> 09:18.035
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT MUDSLINGING,

09:18.035 --> 09:20.560
BUT I'VE GOT SOME
DIRT ON ANTHONY.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.865
IT'S BIG.

09:21.865 --> 09:23.780
AN EYEWITNESS SAW HIM
MAKING AN EXCHANGE

09:23.780 --> 09:26.609
WITH A LOCAL
DRUG DEALER.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.917
WORD IS, HIS
BROTHER'S AN ADDICT.

09:29.917 --> 09:31.396
ANTHONY WAS
BAILING HIM OUT,

09:31.396 --> 09:34.574
BUT DIRT IS DIRT.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.053
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

09:36.053 --> 09:37.577
IT SOUNDS LIKE HE'S JUST
TRYING TO HELP HIS FAMILY.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.143
JIN, ANTHONY'S
WHOLE PLATFORM

09:39.143 --> 09:40.623
IS BEING
TOUGH ON CRIME.

09:40.623 --> 09:42.364
THIS PROVES
HE'S A HYPOCRITE.

09:42.364 --> 09:45.759
WE LEAK THIS, IT'LL
TANK HIS CAMPAIGN.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.674
YOU'RE ALREADY
A LONGSHOT, JIN.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.763
WE NEED TO USE EVERY
ADVANTAGE WE'VE GOT.

09:49.763 --> 09:53.201
I'M SORRY, HARPER.
I CAN'T GO THERE.

09:56.639 --> 09:59.468
- OK.
- YEAH.

09:59.468 --> 10:00.904
OK. GREAT.

10:00.904 --> 10:02.602
NOW INPUT THE LOCATION
REQUEST PROTOCOL.

10:04.342 --> 10:06.518
HIT "ENTER."

10:11.306 --> 10:14.091
DID YOU FIND HIM?

10:15.440 --> 10:18.182
UH, HE'S
AT THE LIBRARY...

10:18.182 --> 10:19.662
OUR LIBRARY.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.055
WHAT THE HELL
IS HE DOING THERE?

10:21.055 --> 10:22.665
DOESN'T MATTER.
I KNOW WHERE HE IS.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.798
WAIT.
DON'T YOU WANT...

10:25.625 --> 10:26.669
BACKUP?

10:46.210 --> 10:47.472
PSHYOO!

10:47.472 --> 10:49.736

11:43.006 --> 11:46.096
DO YOU KNOW WHO
BROUGHT YOU HERE?

11:46.096 --> 11:47.402
YOU DID.

11:47.402 --> 11:49.970
YOU IMAGINED A PLACE
SIMILAR TO THIS REALM,

11:49.970 --> 11:53.016
SO YOUR TRAVELER GIFT
SENT YOU HERE.

11:53.016 --> 11:55.192
SO THIS PLACE IS
IN MY IMAGINATION?

11:55.192 --> 11:57.847
THIS REALM
IS VERY REAL.

11:57.847 --> 12:00.763
YOU'RE A TRAVELER BORN
WITH UNIQUE ABILITY.

12:00.763 --> 12:02.896
IT CAN SEND YOU ANYWHERE.

12:02.896 --> 12:04.811
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

12:04.811 --> 12:08.031
I'M NOT.
I'M A TRAVELER, TOO.

12:08.031 --> 12:10.294
MY POWERS
ARE LIMITED NOW,

12:10.294 --> 12:12.557
BUT THIS GIFT
CONNECTS US.

12:12.557 --> 12:16.039
I COULD HEAR YOU
CALLING OUT FOR HELP.

12:16.039 --> 12:19.826
WE COMMUNICATE NOW
FROM A DISTANCE.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.785
I WANT TO GO HOME.

12:22.785 --> 12:24.700
MM, I KNOW, CHILD,

12:24.700 --> 12:27.703
BUT GETTING BACK
WILL TAKE TIME.

12:27.703 --> 12:29.531
SO I'M STUCK HERE?

12:29.531 --> 12:34.405
YES, UNTIL YOU LEARN
HOW TO MASTER YOUR GIFT.

12:34.405 --> 12:37.408
I WILL TEACH YOU.

13:08.831 --> 13:11.965
RUSSELL TAN?

13:19.755 --> 13:21.104
UH, WHAT
AM I LOOKING AT?

13:21.104 --> 13:23.106
YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT
RUSSELL TAN THAN ANYONE.

13:23.106 --> 13:25.282
WE THOUGHT MAYBE YOU KNOW
WHAT BO'S LOOKING FOR.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.937
I WANT TO FIND
PEI-LING.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.852
I'M SORRY YOUR NEW
BOYFRIEND FLIPPED ON YOU,

13:29.852 --> 13:31.332
BUT FINDING HIM
IS NOT--

13:31.332 --> 13:33.638
HE DIDN'T FLIP.

13:35.249 --> 13:39.514
HE'S BEEN WORKING WITH
XIAO THIS ENTIRE TIME.

13:39.514 --> 13:42.169
BO IS THE HARVESTER.

13:42.169 --> 13:44.824
HUH...

13:44.824 --> 13:47.478
AND YOU LED HIM
RIGHT TO OUR DOOR.

13:47.478 --> 13:49.089
YOU GAVE THEM EVERYTHING.

13:49.089 --> 13:50.525
YES.

13:50.525 --> 13:52.962
IT'S MY FAULT
XIAO HAS PEI-LING.

13:55.922 --> 13:58.533
BO COULD BE LOOKING
FOR ANYTHING--

13:58.533 --> 14:00.622
TAN'S BUSINESS HOLDING,
HIS UNDERWORLD CONNECTIONS,

14:00.622 --> 14:01.753
MYSTICAL ARTIFACTS.

14:01.753 --> 14:03.668
WELL, WE NEED
TO KNOW WHAT,

14:03.668 --> 14:05.757
FIGURE OUT
BO'S NEXT MOVE.

14:05.757 --> 14:07.803
FINDING HIM,
SHAKING HIM DOWN,

14:07.803 --> 14:09.544
IT'S OUR BEST SHOT
AT FINDING XIAO

14:09.544 --> 14:10.937
AND SAVING
YOUR SISTER.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.982
I'VE SEEN YOUR IDEA
OF A SHAKEDOWN.

14:12.982 --> 14:16.029
THIS IS NO TIME
FOR KID GLOVES.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.682
WHEN WE GET
OUR HANDS ON BO,

14:17.682 --> 14:18.858
I WON'T HOLD BACK.

14:18.858 --> 14:22.296
GOOD. WE'RE GONNA
MAKE HIM PAY.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.517
OK. THAT ONE
IS PRETTY CLOSE.

14:26.517 --> 14:28.519
THAT'S THE ONE
I CHEATED WITH,

14:28.519 --> 14:29.912
MORE EXPENSIVE INGREDIENTS.

14:29.912 --> 14:31.783
PRODUCING THOSE
AT SCALE WOULD COST

14:31.783 --> 14:34.612
13 CENTS EACH
AT MINIMUM,

14:34.612 --> 14:36.005
AND, OF COURSE,
IT'S THE ONLY ONE

14:36.005 --> 14:38.094
THAT PASSES
OUR TASTE TEST.

14:38.094 --> 14:40.183
THANKS, LEWIS.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.058
HMM.

14:48.104 --> 14:51.020
RYAN, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

14:51.020 --> 14:53.283
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE XIAO COULD BE,

14:53.283 --> 14:54.894
NOT HAVING
MUCH LUCK.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.113
WHY AREN'T YOU AT THE
HOUSE WITH THE OTHERS?

14:57.113 --> 14:59.811
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S
GETTING KIND OF CROWDED.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.075
AND YOUR APARTMENT?

15:02.075 --> 15:04.468
WHAT'S WITH
THE THIRD DEGREE?

15:04.468 --> 15:06.557
CAN'T YOUR SON
GET IN SOME WORK

15:06.557 --> 15:09.125
AT THE FAMILY
RESTAURANT?

15:09.125 --> 15:11.823
RYAN?

15:15.871 --> 15:19.788
ALL RIGHT. FINE.
IT'S BEEN KIND OF HARD.

15:19.788 --> 15:22.312
SEBASTIAN LEFT.

15:22.312 --> 15:25.576
HE'S BEEN STRUGGLING SINCE
HE LEFT THE RESTAURANT,

15:25.576 --> 15:27.970
AND SOME STUFF
WENT DOWN WITH XIAO.

15:27.970 --> 15:30.755
GETTING POSSESSED
BY A VIOLENT WITCH

15:30.755 --> 15:33.019
DREDGED UP
SOME STUFF FOR HIM.

15:33.019 --> 15:36.152
HE SAID HE NEEDED
TIME TO PROCESS.

15:36.152 --> 15:38.894
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
SEBASTIAN IS GOING THROUGH,

15:38.894 --> 15:42.245
BUT I DO KNOW THIS.

15:42.245 --> 15:45.988
HE LOVES YOU DEEPLY.

15:48.251 --> 15:52.125
UH, HOW HAVE YOU
BEEN WITHOUT HIM?

15:52.125 --> 15:54.779
I COULD DO WITH SOME
OF HIS FIGHT RIGHT NOW.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.607
HE WERE HERE,

15:56.607 --> 15:58.131
HE'D WORK ALL
SORTS OF TROUBLE.

15:58.131 --> 16:01.482
OH, YEAH. MM-HMM.
HA HA HA!

16:01.482 --> 16:03.658
HA!

16:05.138 --> 16:06.835
OH.

16:06.835 --> 16:09.533
WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

16:09.533 --> 16:14.886
I AM GOING
TO MAKE SOME TROUBLE.

16:16.845 --> 16:19.021
I AM NO EXPERT,

16:19.021 --> 16:21.458
BUT I TOO
HAVE ENCOUNTERED

16:21.458 --> 16:24.809
THIS ANCIENT
ALCHEMIST TRAVELER,

16:24.809 --> 16:27.856
AND IT WAS TERRIFYING,

16:27.856 --> 16:31.120
BUT THAT IS NOT
GOING TO STOP ME.

16:31.120 --> 16:34.732
SEBASTIAN WILL
WORK THIS THROUGH,

16:34.732 --> 16:37.083
AND HE'LL
COME BACK.

16:46.396 --> 16:49.704
ANCIENT ALCHEMIST...

16:51.532 --> 16:52.968
TRAVELER.

16:52.968 --> 16:55.101
XIAO'S SOME KIND
OF MYSTICAL TRAVELER, RIGHT,

16:55.101 --> 16:57.103
ABLE TO GO ANYWHERE
IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE...

16:57.103 --> 16:58.017
UH-HUH?

16:58.017 --> 16:59.322
SO I STARTED THINKING.

16:59.322 --> 17:00.497
WHY WOULD SHE SNEAK
ONTO A FREIGHT TRAIN

17:00.497 --> 17:01.846
TO GET OUT OF TOWN?

17:01.846 --> 17:03.718
WHY NOT JUST
BLINK AWAY UNLESS--

17:03.718 --> 17:05.328
- SHE CAN'T TRAVEL.
- EXACTLY.

17:05.328 --> 17:06.547
WHAT'S
STOPPING HER?

17:06.547 --> 17:08.070
AH, THAT'S
WHAT I WONDERED,

17:08.070 --> 17:09.724
SO I STARTED GOING
THROUGH MY OLD RESEARCH

17:09.724 --> 17:11.334
AND FOUND THIS.

17:11.334 --> 17:13.162
ACCORDING TO XIAO,
EVERY TRAVELER

17:13.162 --> 17:14.685
MUST POSSESS
A HU SHEN FU

17:14.685 --> 17:16.122
TO TRULY CONTROL
THEIR ABILITY.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.688
UH, WHAT'S
A HU SHEN FU?

17:17.688 --> 17:19.516
LIKE A TALISMAN
OR A TOTEM,

17:19.516 --> 17:22.954
A TOOL TO ANCHOR THEMSELVES
TO THEIR ORIGINAL REALM.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.869
A TRAVELER'S TOTEM
KEEPS THEM

17:24.869 --> 17:26.262
FROM GETTING TRAPPED
IN THE ETHER

17:26.262 --> 17:28.569
AS THEY TRAVEL
BETWEEN REALMS.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.179
NOW...

17:30.179 --> 17:32.181
WHAT IF XIAO
LOST HERS?

17:32.181 --> 17:34.096
SHE DIED THOUSANDS
OF YEARS AGO,

17:34.096 --> 17:35.880
COULD BE ANYWHERE.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.274
NOT JUST ANYWHERE.

17:38.274 --> 17:40.189
I CAN THINK OF ONE
RECENTLY DECEASED

17:40.189 --> 17:42.104
XIAO-OBSESSED COLLECTOR
OF ANCIENT ARTIFACTS

17:42.104 --> 17:44.367
WHO MIGHT HAVE GOTTEN
HIS HANDS ON THIS TOTEM.

17:44.367 --> 17:45.760
RUSSELL.

17:45.760 --> 17:47.196
THAT MUST BE WHY BO
WAS LOOKING INTO HIM.

17:47.196 --> 17:48.763
HE'S TRYING TO FIND
XIAO'S LOST TOTEM.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.373
SO WE JUST NEED TO
FIND IT BEFORE BO DOES.

17:50.373 --> 17:51.983
HOW? IT'S NOT LIKE WE
KNOW WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

17:53.594 --> 17:55.117
TO CREATE
A HU SHEN FU,

17:55.117 --> 17:56.945
A TRAVELER MUST IMBUE
A PERSONAL OBJECT

17:56.945 --> 17:58.599
WITH THEIR
TRAVELER MAGIC.

17:58.599 --> 17:59.948
EACH ONE IS UNIQUE
TO ITS OWNER,

17:59.948 --> 18:01.558
AND, ACCORDING
TO XIAO'S JOURNALS,

18:01.558 --> 18:04.126
THIS ONE'S HERS.

18:04.126 --> 18:06.041
AN IMPERIAL SEAL.

18:06.041 --> 18:07.695
EMPERORS WOULD
GIVE THEM OUT

18:07.695 --> 18:10.176
TO MOST TRUSTED ADVISORS.

18:10.176 --> 18:12.917
XIAO'S FATHER WAS
AN IMPERIAL ADVISOR.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.919
MAYBE THAT'S HOW SHE
GOT HER HANDS ON ONE.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.747
ALL RIGHT, SO WE KNOW
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE

18:16.747 --> 18:18.140
AND WHO PROBABLY
HAD IT LAST,

18:18.140 --> 18:19.881
BUT RUSSELL'S DEAD.

18:19.881 --> 18:21.143
POLICE SEIZED
HIS PROPERTY.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.579
IT COULD BE
SOLD OFF BY NOW.

18:22.579 --> 18:24.929
NO. LAST I HEARD
FROM MY BOSS,

18:24.929 --> 18:27.018
THE POLICE ARE STILL
UNWINDING HIS ASSETS.

18:27.018 --> 18:29.282
EVERYTHING THAT WAS SEIZED
IS STILL IN EVIDENCE.

18:29.282 --> 18:31.022
ALTHEA, CAN WE
HACK INTO SFPD

18:31.022 --> 18:32.894
AND FIND OUT WHERE THEY'RE
STORING RUSSELL'S STUFF?

18:32.894 --> 18:34.461
OH, THEY REDID
THEIR ENTIRE SYSTEM.

18:34.461 --> 18:36.811
EVEN IF I BROKE MY DEAL
AND DID IT MYSELF,

18:36.811 --> 18:38.247
IT WOULD
TAKE ME DAYS.

18:38.247 --> 18:39.901
THE CITY KEEP
HARD-COPY BACKUPS

18:39.901 --> 18:41.816
OF EVERYTHING,
INCLUDING RECORDS

18:41.816 --> 18:44.123
OF ALL MAJOR SFPD
PROPERTY SEIZURES.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.907
THEY'D LIST WHICH
EVIDENCE FACILITY

18:45.907 --> 18:47.561
TAN'S ASSETS
ENDED UP IN.

18:47.561 --> 18:49.215
THERE SHOULD BE COPIES
IN A FEW GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS,

18:49.215 --> 18:51.042
INCLUDING
THE COURTHOUSE

18:51.042 --> 18:52.479
ACROSS THE STREET
FROM MY OFFICE.

18:52.479 --> 18:53.610
NADIA, NO.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.438
MY D.A. BADGE
CAN GET ME IN.

18:55.438 --> 18:57.701
I'LL BE CAREFUL.

18:57.701 --> 18:59.442
OK. WE HAVE A PLAN.

18:59.442 --> 19:01.575
ASSUMING WE CAN
MOVE FASTER THAN BO.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.054
WE HAVE TO.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.708
IF WE DON'T GET TO XIAO'S
TOTEM BEFORE BO DOES,

19:04.708 --> 19:07.407
SHE'LL BE FREE
TO GO ANYWHERE,

19:07.407 --> 19:09.148
DISAPPEAR COMPLETELY.

19:09.148 --> 19:12.020
PEI-LING WILL BE GONE.

19:26.730 --> 19:29.255
UH! UH!

19:29.255 --> 19:31.518
GET UP.

19:31.518 --> 19:33.302
IT DIDN'T WORK.

19:33.302 --> 19:34.912
IT IS ONLY
THROUGH PRACTICE

19:34.912 --> 19:36.262
THAT YOU WILL
DEVELOP YOUR GIFT

19:36.262 --> 19:38.089
AND BECOME
A TRUE TRAVELER.

19:38.089 --> 19:40.309
I JUST END UP
IN THE SAME PLACE.

19:40.309 --> 19:43.182
- SHIFU, I'M TRYING--
- TRY HARDER.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.532
IN TIME, YOUR BOND
WITH YOUR HU SHEN FU

19:45.532 --> 19:47.316
WILL STRENGTHEN.

19:47.316 --> 19:50.754
YOU WANT TO GET HOME,
DON'T YOU?

19:50.754 --> 19:52.365
IF YOU REJECT
MY GUIDANCE,

19:52.365 --> 19:54.280
I CAN ALWAYS
STOP COMING HERE.

19:54.280 --> 19:55.716
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT,

19:55.716 --> 19:57.196
TO BE ALONE
IN THIS WORLD?

19:57.196 --> 19:59.763
I ACCEPT
YOUR GUIDANCE.

19:59.763 --> 20:03.506
GOOD.
THEN TRY AGAIN.

20:17.085 --> 20:18.391
THE POTHOLES
ON OUR STREET

20:18.391 --> 20:20.523
HAVE BEEN THERE SO LONG,
OUR KIDS NAMED THEM.

20:20.523 --> 20:23.178
OOH, GRACE, OH, MY. LISTEN.

20:23.178 --> 20:25.267
WHEN I TAKE OFFICE,
I WILL MAKE SURE

20:25.267 --> 20:27.051
THEY'RE
TAKEN CARE OF.

20:27.051 --> 20:29.706
WE CAN DEFINITELY
GET RID OF THEM.

20:29.706 --> 20:33.841
HEY, ANTHONY.
NICE TO SEE YOU.

20:33.841 --> 20:35.538
WHAT A GREAT EVENT.

20:35.538 --> 20:36.887
MM-HMM.

20:36.887 --> 20:38.237
DON'T BE
SUSPICIOUS, JIN.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.500
I JUST STOPPED BY
TO WISH YOU LUCK, OK?

20:40.500 --> 20:42.066
THANK YOU.

20:42.066 --> 20:44.155
OH, ALSO WANTED
TO PICK YOUR BRAIN.

20:44.155 --> 20:46.723
I JUST GOT OFF
THE PHONE WITH MY STAFF.

20:46.723 --> 20:48.290
WE'RE TRYING
TO PUT AN END

20:48.290 --> 20:51.119
TO ALL THE ILLEGAL EVICTIONS.

20:51.119 --> 20:54.078
I GOT SOME IDEAS,
BUT--I'M CURIOUS--

20:54.078 --> 20:56.559
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
ABOUT THAT?

20:56.559 --> 20:59.258
AH, YOU WANT TO HEAR
MY THOUGHTS, HUH?

20:59.258 --> 21:00.563
WELL, I THINK
THIS SHOULD BE

21:00.563 --> 21:02.391
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION,
DON'T YOU?

21:02.391 --> 21:05.394
WHY? THESE ARE
MY CONSTITUENTS,

21:05.394 --> 21:07.483
THE PEOPLE YOU SEEK
TO REPRESENT.

21:07.483 --> 21:09.006
AH.

21:09.006 --> 21:11.444
SHOULDN'T THEY
HEAR THIS?

21:11.444 --> 21:14.011
WELL, I HAVE MY OFFICE
REACH OUT TO THE LANDLORDS

21:14.011 --> 21:15.752
AND ATTEMPT
TO NEGOTIATE--

21:15.752 --> 21:18.189
BUT THAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL,
USING YOUR POSITION

21:18.189 --> 21:20.322
TO PUT PRESSURE
ON THE LANDLORD.

21:20.322 --> 21:22.585
THESE THINGS NEED TO GO
THROUGH THE RENT BOARD.

21:22.585 --> 21:25.458
- I GOT ANOTHER ONE FOR YOU.
- OK.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.938
I'M SURE YOU'VE READ
THE SFMTA's PROPOSAL

21:27.938 --> 21:30.289
TO REVAMP MUNI ROUTES
IN OUR DISTRICT.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.379
IT'S PRETTY CONTROVERSIAL,

21:33.379 --> 21:38.253
AND, WELL, I'M DYING
TO HEAR YOUR POSITION.

21:44.955 --> 21:46.653
NADIA, YOU IN?

21:46.653 --> 21:48.829
NADIA, ON PHONE:
NOT YET, BIT CROWDED HERE,

21:48.829 --> 21:51.179
JUST WAITING
FOR MY MOMENT.

21:51.179 --> 21:54.051
SO, UH,
HOW YOU DOING?

21:54.051 --> 21:55.705
I'LL FEEL BETTER
ONCE NADIA GETS THE FILE

21:55.705 --> 21:57.272
AND GETS OUT.

21:57.272 --> 22:00.493
YEAH. YOU KNOW THAT'S
NOT WHAT I MEANT. BO?

22:00.493 --> 22:02.321
THAT'S ON ME,

22:02.321 --> 22:04.105
SHOULD'VE SEEN
THROUGH HIM.

22:04.105 --> 22:06.150
HOW COULD YOU?

22:06.150 --> 22:08.414
IF IT'S ANYONE'S
FAULT, IT'S MINE.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.764
I'M THE ONE WHO
SHOVED HIM ON YOU.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.854
I JUST KEEP THINKING
THERE'S MORE TO THE STORY,

22:13.854 --> 22:15.638
LIKE MAYBE XIAO
MANIPULATED HIM.

22:15.638 --> 22:17.858
I CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW YOU MUST FEEL.

22:17.858 --> 22:20.382
BECAUSE I SLEPT
WITH HIM?

22:21.383 --> 22:23.167
BO SLAUGHTERED
DOZENS OF WARRIOR

22:23.167 --> 22:24.647
AND GUARDIAN
SPIRITS, OK?

22:24.647 --> 22:27.128
HE HELPED XIAO
STEAL PEI-LING'S BODY,

22:27.128 --> 22:28.999
SO WHAT HE DID
TO ME PERSONALLY

22:28.999 --> 22:31.262
HARDLY EVEN RANKS.

22:31.262 --> 22:33.352
NADIA, ON PHONE:
OK. I'M IN.

22:42.056 --> 22:43.666
I DON'T SEE IT
IN THE CASE FILES.

22:43.666 --> 22:45.189
EVAN, ON PHONE:
MAYBE SOMEONE FILED IT

22:45.189 --> 22:47.627
WITH
THE SEARCH WARRANTS.

22:51.805 --> 22:54.460
HEH. GOT IT.

22:54.460 --> 22:57.332
XIAO'S TOTEM
IS LOCKED UP

22:57.332 --> 22:59.856
IN THE HARRISON
STREET FACILITY.

22:59.856 --> 23:02.163
IT'S POLICE EVIDENCE STORAGE.
IT'S IN THE MISSION.

23:02.163 --> 23:03.382
THANKS, NADIA.

23:03.382 --> 23:07.081
GOT TO GET THERE
BEFORE BO DOES.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.396
UH!

23:34.500 --> 23:37.285
ALTHEA GAVE ME
HER LOCK PICK CODE.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.682
WHAT IS TAKING
SO LONG?

23:42.682 --> 23:44.074
GIVE ME A SECOND.

23:44.074 --> 23:45.554
THERE'S GOT TO BE
ANOTHER WAY IN.

23:45.554 --> 23:47.251
EVAN AND NADIA SAID THIS
IS THE SAFEST ENTRANCE.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.427
I DON'T CARE. BO COULD
ALREADY BE INSIDE.

23:49.819 --> 23:52.387
LET'S JUST STICK WITH
THE PLAN JUST FOR FUN.

24:19.806 --> 24:21.590
WAIT.

24:21.590 --> 24:22.765
WHAT'S WRONG?

24:22.765 --> 24:24.071
I FELT SOMETHING.

24:24.071 --> 24:25.551
SOMETHING MAGICKY?
THE COMPASS?

24:25.551 --> 24:26.639
YEAH.

24:26.639 --> 24:27.944
YOUR POWER
WORKS LIKE THAT?

24:27.944 --> 24:29.555
I GUESS SO.

24:29.555 --> 24:31.121
IT'S GOT
TO BE BO.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.994
IF IT IS,
HE'S CLOSE.

24:33.994 --> 24:36.387
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
TO REDUCE CRIME

24:36.387 --> 24:39.434
BESIDES LOCKING
MORE PEOPLE UP.

24:39.434 --> 24:44.308
YOU KNOW, WE INCARCERATE
TO PUNISH,

24:44.308 --> 24:47.094
BUT WE DON'T
REHABILITATE,

24:47.094 --> 24:49.749
AND THAT MAKES
THE PROBLEM EVEN WORSE.

24:49.749 --> 24:53.317
THEN WE HAND OUR MONEY
AND OUR SAFETY

24:53.317 --> 24:55.494
TO A PRIVATE
SECURITY FIRM,

24:55.494 --> 24:56.625
AND THAT'S
AN ANSWER?

24:56.625 --> 24:57.974
YESTERDAY'S
NEWS, JIN.

24:57.974 --> 24:59.628
ORDINANCE 11
HAS ALREADY PASSED.

24:59.628 --> 25:01.325
IT GOES INTO
EFFECT TOMORROW.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.502
I ADMIRE
YOUR IDEALISM,

25:03.502 --> 25:06.940
BUT CRIMINALS MUST
FACE CONSEQUENCES.

25:06.940 --> 25:08.507
I DIDN'T SAY
THEY DIDN'T.

25:08.507 --> 25:10.596
THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT
THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES

25:10.596 --> 25:12.423
FOR CROSSING
THE LINE.

25:12.423 --> 25:15.165
LIKE PAYING OFF
A DRUG DEALER?

25:22.216 --> 25:24.261
LOOK. I MAY NOT HAVE
ALL THE ANSWERS,

25:24.261 --> 25:27.395
BUT I CAN MAKE
A DIFFERENCE.

25:27.395 --> 25:30.050
NICE WORDS, JIN,
BUT THIS DISTRICT

25:30.050 --> 25:32.269
NEEDS
MORE THAN WORDS.

25:32.269 --> 25:36.360
WE NEED SOMEONE WHO KNOWS
HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS...

25:37.623 --> 25:41.365
REAL CHANGE,
NOT TALK.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.024
THAT WAS IT.
THAT WAS YOUR CHANCE.

25:48.024 --> 25:49.373
CAN'T DO IT.

25:49.373 --> 25:51.593
FAMILY
IS OFF LIMITS.

25:51.593 --> 25:53.726
MAYBE,
BUT IN POLITICS,

25:53.726 --> 25:56.424
YOU PULL PUNCHES,
YOU GET HIT.

26:05.476 --> 26:07.653
I'LL ADMIT, THOSE
ARE MUCH BETTER--

26:07.653 --> 26:08.871
HEH.

26:08.871 --> 26:11.439
GOOD FLAVOR,
GREAT CHEW.

26:11.439 --> 26:13.702
HOW'D YOU GET THEM
DOWN TO COST?

26:13.702 --> 26:15.225
I DIDN'T.

26:15.225 --> 26:16.836
BY MY ESTIMATES,
THESE WOULD COST

26:16.836 --> 26:18.315
13 CENTS TO PRODUCE.

26:18.315 --> 26:19.621
THAT'S AS LOW
AS I COULD GO

26:19.621 --> 26:21.405
WITHOUT SERVING FOOD
I'D BE ASHAMED OF.

26:21.405 --> 26:24.017
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
THE IMPACT

26:24.017 --> 26:26.236
3 CENTS WOULD
HAVE AT SCALE,

26:26.236 --> 26:27.760
WHAT THAT WOULD
DO TO OUR PROFITS?

26:27.760 --> 26:29.413
YES.
I RESEARCHED THAT.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.415
IT WOULD TIGHTEN
OUR MARGINS,

26:31.415 --> 26:33.461
BUT BY CORPORATE
SALES PROJECTIONS,

26:33.461 --> 26:35.855
THESE WOULD STILL
TURN IN A HEALTHY PROFIT.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.291
BELOW TARGET.

26:37.291 --> 26:40.294
MY BOSSES'LL
NEVER AGREE TO IT.

26:40.294 --> 26:43.732
ACTUALLY,
THEY ALREADY HAVE.

26:43.732 --> 26:46.039
I HAD A LOVELY CONVERSATION

26:46.039 --> 26:49.433
WITH MR. MILLER,
OUR HEAD OF RETAIL,

26:49.433 --> 26:50.913
WHEN I SENT
SOME OF THESE

26:50.913 --> 26:52.654
OVER TO HIS OFFICE
FOR LUNCH.

26:52.654 --> 26:55.439
WE CAME TO THE AGREEMENT
THAT BETTING ON QUALITY

26:55.439 --> 26:57.528
WOULD PAY OFF FOR US
IN THE LONG TERM,

26:57.528 --> 27:01.837
AND HE HAS ACCEPTED
THE ADJUSTMENT IN COST.

27:01.837 --> 27:03.709
HE'S JUST WAITING
FOR YOUR AGREEMENT

27:03.709 --> 27:05.754
ON THE ASSESSMENT
OF TASTE,

27:05.754 --> 27:07.800
AND I BELIEVE
YOUR WORDS WERE

27:07.800 --> 27:11.238
"GOOD FLAVOR,
GREAT CHEW."

27:14.937 --> 27:17.984
OK, THEN.
NICE WORK.

27:36.176 --> 27:39.048
OK. YOU GOT THIS, BO.
YOU'RE AMAZING. OK.

27:43.923 --> 27:46.142
UH!

27:46.142 --> 27:47.274
I DID IT.

27:47.274 --> 27:49.276
YOU STILL HAVE
MUCH TO LEARN,

27:49.276 --> 27:51.321
BUT A GOOD START.

27:51.321 --> 27:53.149
WE'LL RESUME YOUR
TRAINING TOMORROW.

27:53.149 --> 27:54.237
WAIT. DON'T
LEAVE ME ALONE.

27:54.237 --> 27:55.238
PLEASE. DON'T GO.

27:55.238 --> 27:56.413
I CAN'T STAY.

27:56.413 --> 27:58.111
I AM TRAPPED
IN ANOTHER WORLD

27:58.111 --> 28:00.113
BETWEEN LIFE
AND DEATH,

28:00.113 --> 28:02.768
DEPRIVED OF MY
ABILITIES, OF A BODY.

28:04.117 --> 28:05.292
PLEASE.

28:05.292 --> 28:07.990
YOU FEAR
THE SHADOW CREATURES.

28:07.990 --> 28:10.253
I COULD HELP,

28:10.253 --> 28:13.692
TEACH YOU TO FIGHT,
MAKE YOU STRONG.

28:13.692 --> 28:14.954
WOULD YOU
LIKE THAT?

28:14.954 --> 28:16.999
I NEED TO KNOW
I CAN TRUST YOU.

28:16.999 --> 28:19.523
OF COURSE.
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.

28:19.523 --> 28:21.351
I MUST KNOW
YOU WILL BE LOYAL

28:21.351 --> 28:24.615
AND THAT YOU WILL
ALWAYS DO AS YOU'RE TOLD.

28:24.615 --> 28:27.096
SOME THINGS I'LL ASK
MAY CONFUSE YOU.

28:27.096 --> 28:30.012
THEY MAY EVEN
SEEM BAD.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.407
YOU WANT ME
TO DO BAD THINGS?

28:33.407 --> 28:34.887
MY MISTAKE, CHILD.
I THOUGHT YOU WERE READY.

28:34.887 --> 28:36.671
NO, NO, NO. I'M SORRY.
SORRY. WAIT. PLEASE.

28:36.671 --> 28:38.499
PLEASE.

28:38.499 --> 28:41.241
DON'T LEAVE ME ALONE.

28:41.241 --> 28:42.851
HEY, I'M SORRY.

28:42.851 --> 28:44.374
I PROMISE I'M READY.

28:44.374 --> 28:45.985
IF YOU TEACH ME
TO FIGHT,

28:45.985 --> 28:49.031
I WILL DO
WHAT YOU ASK.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.772
HMM.

28:50.772 --> 28:52.948
ALWAYS?

28:52.948 --> 28:55.081
ALWAYS.

29:24.850 --> 29:27.548
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

29:29.985 --> 29:31.247
HEY, LOOK, OFFICER.

29:31.247 --> 29:33.075
THIS IS JUST A HUGE MISUNDERSTANDING.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.512
- WE CAN EXPLAIN.
- WE CAN?

29:35.512 --> 29:37.863
BACKUP REQUESTED
AT STORAGE ROOM 6.

29:37.863 --> 29:40.735
WE'VE GOT A BREAK-IN.

30:28.522 --> 30:31.090
WHERE IS IT,
XIAO'S TOTEM?

30:31.090 --> 30:32.656
I KNOW YOU
CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

30:32.656 --> 30:34.136
YOU THINK THAT
XIAO'S A MONSTER.

30:34.136 --> 30:35.485
SHE IS A MONSTER.

30:35.485 --> 30:36.530
NO.

30:36.530 --> 30:38.662
SHE ATTACKED
MY PARENTS, BO.

30:38.662 --> 30:41.143
SHE TRIED TO KILL
MY MOTHER.

30:41.143 --> 30:42.623
WHAT SHE DID
TO PEI-LING,

30:42.623 --> 30:44.364
TO ALL THE WARRIOR
AND GUARDIAN SPIRITS,

30:44.364 --> 30:46.148
THE ONES THAT YOU
HUNTED FOR HER--

30:46.148 --> 30:48.020
SHE WAS TRYING
TO SAVE THEM.

30:48.020 --> 30:49.848
YOU REALLY
ARE A FOOL.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.852
DON'T.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.505
DON'T GIVE IT TO HER.

30:55.505 --> 30:58.682
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
SHE'LL DO WITH THAT POWER.

31:01.207 --> 31:03.470
SHE'S MY SHIFU.

31:06.299 --> 31:08.388
NO!

31:13.393 --> 31:15.047
HE HAS
XIAO'S TOTEM.

31:15.047 --> 31:16.570
WE HAVE TO FIND HIM
BEFORE HE GETS IT TO HER.

31:16.570 --> 31:18.006
HE COULD BE ON THE OTHER
SIDE OF THE WORLD BY NOW,

31:18.006 --> 31:19.399
ANOTHER WORLD ALTOGETHER.

31:19.399 --> 31:20.748
THIS PLACE IS
CRAWLING WITH COPS.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.141
WE HAVE
TO GO NOW.

31:22.141 --> 31:24.143
I FEEL SOMETHING.

31:24.143 --> 31:26.145
HIS TOTEM,
IT WAS IN HIS HAND.

31:26.145 --> 31:29.626
WHEN HE LEFT,
IT'S LIKE I HELD ON TO IT.

31:30.976 --> 31:33.369
I KNOW WHERE HE IS.

31:57.350 --> 31:59.221
BO, VOICE-OVER:
I KNOW YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

31:59.221 --> 32:00.570
YOU THINK THAT XIAO'S A MONSTER.

32:00.570 --> 32:02.355
NICKY, VOICE-OVER:
SHE IS A MONSTER.

32:02.355 --> 32:05.924
SHE ATTACKED MY PARENTS.
SHE TRIED TO KILL MY MOTHER.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.013
MAN, VOICE-OVER: AAGH!

32:08.013 --> 32:11.755
AAGH! AAGH!

32:11.755 --> 32:14.019
AAH!

32:14.933 --> 32:17.413
MY SON.

32:19.024 --> 32:20.373
WHY DID YOU
CALL ME BACK HERE?

32:20.373 --> 32:21.983
THIS IS
WHERE WE MET,

32:21.983 --> 32:23.942
WHERE YOUR
TRAINING BEGAN.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.683
YOU WERE JUST
A SCARED, LITTLE BOY

32:26.683 --> 32:28.772
TRAPPED HERE.

32:28.772 --> 32:31.079
YOU'VE GROWN
SO MUCH.

32:31.079 --> 32:33.386
THANKS TO YOU.

32:33.386 --> 32:36.258
YEARS AGO,
YOU MADE A VOW

32:36.258 --> 32:39.348
TO HELP ME RECLAIM
WHAT WAS TAKEN FROM ME,

32:39.348 --> 32:41.698
TO MAKE ME
FLESH AGAIN.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.570
YOU FOUND A WAY?

32:43.570 --> 32:45.093
YES.

32:45.093 --> 32:48.270
NOW YOUR WORK BEGINS.

32:48.270 --> 32:50.185
I NEED YOU
TO RETRIEVE SOMETHING,

32:50.185 --> 32:52.448
WEAPONS OF
ENORMOUS POWER--

32:52.448 --> 32:53.972
TWIN SWORDS.

32:53.972 --> 32:55.451
THERE'S
A WORLD FILLED

32:55.451 --> 32:57.366
WITH LOST
AND BROKEN SOULS.

32:57.366 --> 32:59.194
I NEED YOU TO GO
TO THAT WORLD

32:59.194 --> 33:02.458
AND BRING
THE SOULS TO ME.

33:02.458 --> 33:04.547
HOW?

33:04.547 --> 33:07.159
USE THE SWORDS.

33:08.073 --> 33:10.249
I NEED THE SOULS
TO REGAIN MY POWER,

33:10.249 --> 33:13.643
TO CLAIM MY NEW FORM,
BUT WHEN I AM DONE,

33:13.643 --> 33:17.256
WE'LL RELEASE THEM
FROM THEIR SUFFERING.

33:18.735 --> 33:21.347
THEY'LL BE FREE.

33:25.655 --> 33:27.570
DO YOU HAVE IT?

33:31.009 --> 33:32.880
SHIFU, IS THAT YOU?

33:32.880 --> 33:35.578
MY SON.

33:35.578 --> 33:39.017
WAS IT ALL A LIE?

33:39.017 --> 33:42.368
YOU HAVE YOUR VESSEL,
THE SOULS I TOOK.

33:43.456 --> 33:45.414
YOU SAID YOU
WOULD FREE THEM,

33:45.414 --> 33:48.548
BUT YOU
STILL HAVE THEM.

33:50.202 --> 33:51.812
TELL ME I'M WRONG.

33:51.812 --> 33:55.729
HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN
WHO SAVED YOU...

33:56.643 --> 34:00.038
WHO TAUGHT YOU
HOW TO SURVIVE?

34:00.038 --> 34:02.257
NO.

34:02.257 --> 34:05.739
THAT'S WHY IT KILLS ME
TO DOUBT YOU,

34:05.739 --> 34:07.784
TO WONDER.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.221
THE SOULS...

34:11.223 --> 34:12.876
YOU'RE GOING
TO KEEP THEM.

34:12.876 --> 34:14.530
THOSE SOULS
WERE BOUND TO ME

34:14.530 --> 34:17.359
THE MOMENT I CREATED
THE BLOODLINES.

34:17.359 --> 34:20.580
THEY BELONG TO ME.

34:23.322 --> 34:26.934
I WOULD HAVE DONE
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

34:26.934 --> 34:30.372
I DID
HORRIBLE THINGS.

34:30.372 --> 34:33.854
THIS WHOLE TIME,
WAS I JUST A PAWN?

34:36.117 --> 34:37.771
YES.

34:42.080 --> 34:43.559
WAIT.

34:43.559 --> 34:46.301
- I SHOULD GO ALONE.
- WHAT?

34:46.301 --> 34:47.998
WE ALL CHARGE IN,
WE'LL SPOOK HIM.

34:47.998 --> 34:49.478
HE'LL BE GONE.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.089
NO OFFENSE, BUT YOU'RE
ZERO FOR TWO THERE.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.220
HOW WILL THIS BE
ANY DIFFERENT?

34:52.220 --> 34:55.441
I NEED TO
FACE HIM ALONE.

35:03.449 --> 35:06.495
SO NICKY,
PUSHING US TOGETHER,

35:06.495 --> 35:08.236
FORCING ME
TO BETRAY HER--

35:08.236 --> 35:10.804
I TOLD YOU
TO WATCH HER.

35:10.804 --> 35:14.155
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO GOT INVOLVED,

35:14.155 --> 35:17.550
LEAPING IN
TO SAVE HER.

35:17.550 --> 35:21.119
I MERELY WANTED
EYES ON THE GIRL,

35:21.119 --> 35:23.599
BUT ONCE YOU
GOT INVOLVED,

35:23.599 --> 35:26.080
FALLING
FOR THE GIRL,

35:26.080 --> 35:28.387
I SENSED
HER TRUST IN YOU

35:28.387 --> 35:31.303
COULD BE USEFUL.

35:31.303 --> 35:34.175
IF NICKY
STOOD IN MY WAY,

35:34.175 --> 35:37.483
IF SHE TRIED
TO PROTECT PEI-LING,

35:37.483 --> 35:42.488
PERHAPS YOU COULD
BE THERE TO STOP HER.

35:43.837 --> 35:45.491
I WAS RIGHT.

35:45.491 --> 35:49.147
NOW...
MY HU SHEN FU.

35:53.890 --> 35:56.850
COME ON. UH! UH! BO?

HUH UH! UH!

36:32.494 --> 36:35.584
UH! WHERE'D SHE GO?
WHAT IS SHE PLANNING?

36:35.584 --> 36:37.804
I DON'T KNOW,
I SWEAR.

36:37.804 --> 36:40.154

HE'S ALIVE... BARELY.

37:46.960 --> 37:48.744
XIAO?

UH...

37:50.833 --> 37:53.619

37:59.320 --> 38:00.930
YOU SAID YOU WERE
GONNA BE CAREFUL.

38:00.930 --> 38:02.367
WE'RE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT

38:02.367 --> 38:03.803
WHAT DELTA SECURITY
ENDEAVORS IS UP TO,

38:03.803 --> 38:05.283
AND I WAS
ALREADY THERE.

38:05.283 --> 38:07.676
STILL NO WORD
FROM NICKY?

38:07.676 --> 38:09.504
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

38:09.504 --> 38:11.158
ITS GONNA TAKE A WHILE
TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS,

38:11.158 --> 38:13.421
BUT FROM WHAT
I CAN GATHER,

38:13.421 --> 38:15.031
CRIME ZERO
ISN'T JUST A NAME.

38:15.031 --> 38:16.903
IT'S A PROMISE--
MASS SURVEILLANCE,

38:16.903 --> 38:18.948
RAISING ARREST RATES
THROUGH THE ROOF,

38:18.948 --> 38:20.472
STOMPING ON
CIVIL LIBERTIES.

38:20.472 --> 38:22.778
DELTA'S PLAN TO ELIMINATE
CRIME IN THIS CITY

38:22.778 --> 38:24.780
IS TO TURN IT INTO SOME
KIND OF A POLICE STATE.

38:24.780 --> 38:26.956
GUESS ORDINANCE 11
WAS JUST THE BEGINNING.

38:29.655 --> 38:32.310
HENRY, HEY,
HOW'D IT GO?

38:59.032 --> 38:59.989
UH...

39:02.383 --> 39:03.210
HUH?

39:03.210 --> 39:05.517
AH, OK. OK.

39:07.823 --> 39:09.434
HEY, HARPER.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.131
HARPER, ON PHONE: I GOT A FRIEND
INSIDE ANTHONY'S CAMPAIGN

39:11.131 --> 39:13.394
THAT GAVE ME A LITTLE
COURTESY HEADS-UP.

39:13.394 --> 39:16.919
ANTHONY'S COMING
FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY.

39:16.919 --> 39:19.487
MY FAMILY?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

39:19.487 --> 39:22.360
THEY'RE ROLLING OUT
ATTACK ADS TOMORROW

39:22.360 --> 39:24.971
EXPOSING YOUR DAUGHTER,
SAYING SHE'S VIOLENT,

39:24.971 --> 39:27.539
SOME KIND OF
STREET-FIGHTING VIGILANTE.

39:27.539 --> 39:30.542
I MEAN, I SAID
THAT WAS CRAZY,

39:30.542 --> 39:33.240
BUT AFTER TODAY,
HE'S NOT GONNA BACK DOWN.

39:40.943 --> 39:43.250
NICKY,
ARE YOU IN THERE?

39:48.386 --> 39:50.257
NOW'S NOT
A GOOD TIME, PAPA.

39:50.257 --> 39:52.651
SWEETHEART, SORRY.
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

40:00.093 --> 40:03.531
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT--
NICKY, WAIT.

40:03.531 --> 40:06.012
I HAVE TO GO.
WE'LL TALK LATER.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.840
AH!

40:13.280 --> 40:14.499
NICKY, PLEASE.
LISTEN TO ME.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.892
I CAN'T. PLEASE
JUST LET ME GO.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.851
I JUST--
I CAN'T RIGHT NOW.

40:18.851 --> 40:22.724
OK. WHAT HAPPENED?

40:22.724 --> 40:26.685
OH...HMM?

40:27.903 --> 40:30.123
WHAT? I GOT YOU.
COME HERE.

40:30.123 --> 40:32.168
COME HERE,
BABY GIRL.

40:32.168 --> 40:35.171
HEY, NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENED,

40:35.171 --> 40:37.870
IT'LL BE OK.

40:37.870 --> 40:41.221
YOU WILL BE OK.

40:42.744 --> 40:44.398
I PROMISE.

41:10.990 --> 41:12.339
GREG,
MOVE YOUR HEAD.

41:12.339 --> 41:14.210
NICE SHOT, MOM.
