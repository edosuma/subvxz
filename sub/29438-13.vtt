09:43.398 --> 09:45.924
Son, I have a team of top
doctors from St. John's

09:45.926 --> 09:47.123
who take care of my players.

09:47.125 --> 09:49.610
I don't know who you are
or why you were on my field.

09:49.612 --> 09:52.255
Why exactly did you poach
a patient from St. John's

09:52.257 --> 09:53.749
- and bring him here?
- That's not what happened.

09:53.751 --> 09:54.758
I don't care.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.061
I want Dax transferred to
St. John's immediately.

09:57.063 --> 09:58.929
Well, that would be a bad idea.

09:58.931 --> 10:02.415
Dax has sustained significant
injuries to his chest

10:02.417 --> 10:04.843
and his abdomen, leading
to multiple broken ribs,

10:04.845 --> 10:07.295
lung contusions,
lacerations to his spleen.

10:07.297 --> 10:09.255
I trust that, when he stabilizes,

10:09.257 --> 10:11.399
you'll make that transfer
happen as soon as possible.

10:11.401 --> 10:12.592
Y-You have my word.

10:12.594 --> 10:16.245
And I apologize for the
inconvenience. I-I hope...

10:20.119 --> 10:22.894
Bill Landry is the
richest man in Georgia,

10:22.896 --> 10:25.646
and in one morning you have
him pissed off at Chastain.

10:25.648 --> 10:28.649
You shouldn't have been anywhere
near Dax Ramsey to begin with.

10:28.651 --> 10:30.683
He asked for a second
opinion, so I helped.

10:30.685 --> 10:34.781
He's at Chastain now, so your
services are no longer required.

10:34.783 --> 10:35.929
Treating a patient

10:35.931 --> 10:38.213
without hospital privileges
is against the law.

10:38.215 --> 10:40.161
I'm not treating him.

10:40.163 --> 10:41.363
I'm here as a friend.

10:41.365 --> 10:44.883
Which gives Dr. Hawkins
every right to stay.

10:44.885 --> 10:47.643
If you so much as lay
a finger on Dax Ramsey,

10:47.645 --> 10:49.813
I'll have you thrown out and sued.

11:05.539 --> 11:07.779
Wow. You guys already boarding
patients in the hallway?

11:07.781 --> 11:09.315
One of those days.

11:09.317 --> 11:11.859
- You here for my admit?
- First one of the day.

11:11.861 --> 11:15.203
Riley, this is Dr. Pravesh.
He's gonna do an assessment.

11:15.205 --> 11:17.248
Okay. (CLEARS THROAT)
Hey, can I do the thing?

11:17.250 --> 11:18.953
The floor is yours.

11:18.955 --> 11:21.419
Riley Jackson, 28-year-old female.

11:21.421 --> 11:24.992
Five hours of sudden
onset nausea and vomiting.

11:24.994 --> 11:27.258
- Did I get it right?
- Nailed it.

11:27.260 --> 11:29.335
And that's vomiting with a capital "V".

11:29.337 --> 11:31.429
I can't even keep crackers down.

11:31.431 --> 11:33.356
It's good to meet you, Riley.

11:33.358 --> 11:35.175
Uh, can you tell me
when all this started?

11:35.177 --> 11:36.434
Uh, this morning.

11:36.436 --> 11:39.178
I woke up fine, dropped
my daughter off at school.

11:39.180 --> 11:40.555
And then on the drive back home...

11:40.557 --> 11:41.889
- Capital "V"?
- Yeah.

11:41.891 --> 11:43.652
- Hmm.
- All over my steering wheel.

11:43.654 --> 11:44.890
It was not pretty.

11:44.892 --> 11:46.584
Okay. I'm gonna talk to
Dr. Feldman and figure out

11:46.586 --> 11:48.836
- the best way to take care of you, okay?
- Thank you so much.

11:48.838 --> 11:51.950
- All right. We'll be right back.
- Thanks.

11:51.952 --> 11:53.860
Hey, this looks like gastroenteritis.

11:53.862 --> 11:55.194
- This is a soft admit.
- Yeah...

11:55.196 --> 11:56.863
Got you there, Feldman.

11:56.865 --> 11:59.290
Give it a few more hours of
continuous fluids and meds.

11:59.292 --> 12:02.869
Are you seriously
blocking this admission?

12:02.871 --> 12:07.019
Wow, you've, uh, already
become one of them.

12:07.021 --> 12:09.717
(CHUCKLES) Stashing a patient
in the ER for a couple hours,

12:09.719 --> 12:11.136
hoping they somehow cure themselves?

12:11.138 --> 12:13.063
- Internal medicine's signature move.
- DEVON: Look,

12:13.065 --> 12:15.306
I can't give Riley a
bed that doesn't exist.

12:15.308 --> 12:17.298
Between surgical patients
and medical patients,

12:17.300 --> 12:18.891
- a bed isn't available.
- That's true.

12:18.893 --> 12:20.553
They got a lot of
surgical patients today.

12:20.555 --> 12:22.269
- You know, how about you just pick a side, man?
- Pick a side.

12:22.271 --> 12:24.891
Sorry. I like watching you two argue.

12:24.893 --> 12:28.728
My therapist says it's because
I envy your guys' relationship.

12:28.730 --> 12:29.871
Which I do not.

12:33.197 --> 12:35.135
Just because you're busy
upstairs doesn't mean

12:35.137 --> 12:36.661
you get to saddle us with your work.

12:36.663 --> 12:40.331
We don't exactly, uh, have
spare time down here either.

12:40.333 --> 12:43.743
Fine. I'll put in holding orders.

12:43.745 --> 12:46.189
But she will have to board in the ER

12:46.191 --> 12:47.672
until a bed is available.

12:47.674 --> 12:50.350
As long as she's not on my list,
you can do whatever you want.

12:54.130 --> 12:56.014
Look who's here.

12:56.016 --> 12:57.983
(CRYING): Hi.

13:00.428 --> 13:01.969

13:01.971 --> 13:04.856

13:58.762 --> 14:00.760
Oh, well, I want to
take a look at that cut.

14:00.762 --> 14:02.986
- It could get infected.
- I-I got bandages

14:02.988 --> 14:05.355
and all sorts of antiseptic stuff.

14:05.357 --> 14:06.993
I'll be fine.

14:06.995 --> 14:09.186
Okay, well, I thought we were
gonna spend the day together.

14:09.188 --> 14:10.922
You... still want to do that, or... ?

14:10.924 --> 14:12.757
Well, yeah. Sure, sure. Yeah, of course.

14:12.759 --> 14:15.260
I just, I'd like to clean up and...

14:15.262 --> 14:17.095
My place is a mess and, uh...

14:17.097 --> 14:20.598
Tell you what, why don't we
grab lunch a little later?

14:20.600 --> 14:22.776

15:02.545 --> 15:05.980
Were you at least gonna tell
me that you were leaving again?

15:08.765 --> 15:10.073
No.

15:12.935 --> 15:14.652
I thought you were in trouble.

15:14.654 --> 15:17.655
I told you I was fine.

15:17.657 --> 15:19.607
Things have been so good between us,

15:19.609 --> 15:22.234
and you want to throw it all away? Why?

15:22.236 --> 15:25.893
S-Settling down, volunteering
at Chastain, being an angel,

15:25.895 --> 15:29.000
trying to be a good dad
to you, it's exhausting.

15:29.002 --> 15:31.970
- I can't do it anymore.
- So you're just gonna take off again?

15:33.673 --> 15:38.009
Nicky, I burn down every good thing

15:38.011 --> 15:40.270
that's ever happened to me.

15:42.423 --> 15:44.065
That's who I am.

15:47.428 --> 15:51.138
I'm sorry I led you to believe
that, even for a second,

15:51.140 --> 15:52.932
that I had changed.

15:52.934 --> 15:55.360
I... Here.

15:55.362 --> 15:57.912
Here, I want you to have this.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.620
But his history is unremarkable.

16:31.622 --> 16:32.903
Nothing is jumping out at me.

16:32.905 --> 16:35.683
Whoa. If I knew it was you

16:35.685 --> 16:38.008
on the other end of the page,
I would've rallied the troops,

16:38.010 --> 16:39.741
signaled the alarm, called the band...

16:39.743 --> 16:42.133
Can you just say it's good to
see him and be done with it?

16:42.135 --> 16:44.575
- Thanks for coming down, Austin.
- No problem.

16:44.577 --> 16:47.361
I see we're hiding out
in the conference room.

16:47.363 --> 16:48.897
Avoiding Logan Kim, I take it?

16:48.899 --> 16:51.416
And the appearance that I'm
treating a patient in Chastain.

16:51.418 --> 16:53.048
A loophole. I dig it. What's up?

16:53.050 --> 16:55.661
Dax Ramsey. He has a chest
tube, a lacerated spleen,

16:55.663 --> 16:57.371
and multiple pulmonary
contusions with hemorrhage.

16:57.373 --> 16:59.028
Do you think he'll need surgery?

16:59.030 --> 17:02.543
His chest tube is only draining
a hundred mils per hour.

17:02.545 --> 17:04.429
So we have to wait and watch and hope

17:04.431 --> 17:06.276
that his lungs heal itself.

17:06.278 --> 17:08.766
If not, I will come in
and save the day, but...

putting on my trauma fedora...

- Bell, are you seeing what I'm seeing?
- BELL: Yeah.

17:14.189 --> 17:16.140
The injuries are severe
for the trauma he took.

17:16.142 --> 17:17.678
Uh, we were just getting to that.

17:17.680 --> 17:19.700
Is... Any idea why he
wanted a second opinion?

17:19.702 --> 17:21.125
Yeah, over the years, Dax has suffered

17:21.127 --> 17:22.204
more injuries than normal.

17:22.207 --> 17:24.898
He thought maybe his team
doctor missed something.

17:24.901 --> 17:26.890
Yeah, well, I think
Dax was onto something.

17:26.892 --> 17:29.249
- Mm-hmm.

17:47.807 --> 17:50.641
Do it. Abdomen's soft.

CONRAD: Let's go.

18:39.976 --> 18:43.328
I told you what would happen if
I caught you treating a patient.

18:45.182 --> 18:46.922
It was compressions.

18:46.924 --> 18:49.167
For a patient who would
have died otherwise.

18:49.169 --> 18:51.136
It's okay.

18:54.541 --> 18:56.925
- Take care of Dax.
- Yeah.

19:13.726 --> 19:16.727
Well, the lobectomy should keep
Dax's bleeding under control.

19:16.729 --> 19:19.346
We solved one issue, and
another keeps sprouting up.

19:19.348 --> 19:21.157
- You notice his legs were swollen?
- Yeah.

19:21.159 --> 19:24.643
I also saw what looked
like blood in his urine bag.

19:24.645 --> 19:26.996
- He's in rhabdo.
- But why exactly

19:26.998 --> 19:29.023
is his muscle tissue breaking down?

19:29.025 --> 19:31.668
His pH is normal. At
least he's not acidotic.

19:31.670 --> 19:33.670
You know, maybe it's a mixed picture.

19:33.672 --> 19:36.322
Metabolic acidosis plus
respiratory alkalosis.

19:36.324 --> 19:39.008
What is going on with this kid?

19:39.010 --> 19:40.898
You know, the only
thing I know for certain

19:40.900 --> 19:42.253
is we'll figure it out.

19:42.255 --> 19:45.756
No doubt. No, a theory
will come to us in a minute.

19:45.758 --> 19:47.141
We got this.

19:52.006 --> 19:54.340
So it's not coming to
us at-at this m-moment.

19:54.342 --> 19:56.675
Well, w-we... you know, Bell,
we have nothing to prove.

19:56.677 --> 19:58.769
You know, you have a
bomb-ass supplement line

19:58.771 --> 20:00.558
- taking off right now.
- You're a triple-board-certified surgeon.

20:00.560 --> 20:02.550
- Right?
- The reality is, we are out of our wheelhouse.

20:02.552 --> 20:05.392
- Well, that's fair.
- This is much less of a surgical case

20:05.394 --> 20:07.036
- and more of a medical...
- It, uh, is a mystery.

20:07.038 --> 20:08.871

20:13.620 --> 20:15.235

20:15.237 --> 20:17.696
Oh, go ahead, say it.

20:17.698 --> 20:19.698
One of us has to, Bell.

20:19.700 --> 20:22.918
- We might need Conrad Hawkins.
- Now, did that hurt much?

20:22.920 --> 20:25.037
- Yeah, a little.
- Okay.

20:25.039 --> 20:30.226
Look, he can't come here, so
we got to make a house call.

20:30.228 --> 20:33.471
So far, we've only been treating
the trauma-related injuries.

20:33.473 --> 20:35.565
Injuries exacerbated by an underlying,

20:35.567 --> 20:37.642
- undiagnosed condition.
- Right.

20:37.644 --> 20:39.551
CONRAD: We've seen his
records. What do we know?

20:39.553 --> 20:40.970
BELL: He typically experiences vomiting

20:40.972 --> 20:42.238
after strenuous workouts.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.649
And most recently, he's
been suffering a string

20:44.651 --> 20:47.827
of musculoskeletal
injuries and now has rhabdo.

20:51.157 --> 20:53.774
I know that look.

20:53.776 --> 20:55.567
You know, I dig that look.

20:58.114 --> 21:00.423
(EXHALES)

21:00.425 --> 21:03.409
He's not septic. And
while the rhabdo alone

21:03.411 --> 21:05.002
can cause some elevation in the lactate,

21:05.004 --> 21:06.304
it's more than I'd expect.

21:08.007 --> 21:11.017
I think we're seeing...

21:12.753 --> 21:15.421
Type B lactic acidosis.

21:15.423 --> 21:18.866

33:36.329 --> 33:37.346
(SNIFFLES)

33:37.348 --> 33:39.372
(EXHALES)

33:39.374 --> 33:43.427
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you this sooner, but...

33:43.429 --> 33:48.673
when I think about my
future... I see you in it.

33:48.675 --> 33:53.437
At my wedding, walking
me down the aisle.

33:53.439 --> 33:54.991
Birthdays, holidays,

33:54.993 --> 33:57.574
and every moment in
between, you are there.

33:59.703 --> 34:02.746
It would break my
heart if you were gone.

34:04.191 --> 34:05.666
So, no.

34:06.860 --> 34:08.585
I'm not leaving.

34:15.409 --> 34:17.594
Will you be honest with me?

34:20.632 --> 34:23.391
Can you tell me what you are planning?

34:24.710 --> 34:26.603
(CRYING)

34:29.141 --> 34:30.774
Dad.

34:34.387 --> 34:35.387
Okay.

34:36.407 --> 34:39.149
- Sorry.
- Okay. Okay.

34:39.150 --> 34:41.034
Will you give it to me, please?

34:42.228 --> 34:43.871
It's okay.

34:46.608 --> 34:48.324
- Okay.
- (CRYING)

34:48.327 --> 34:50.293
Okay.

34:55.283 --> 34:58.076
- I'm scared.
- It's okay. It's okay.

34:58.078 --> 35:00.012
(EXHALES)

35:06.660 --> 35:08.424
Bell, what happened?

35:08.426 --> 35:10.384
Well, I noticed his
abdomen was distended,

35:10.386 --> 35:12.015
and then his hemoglobin took a dive.

35:12.017 --> 35:13.668
What, you're thinking
it's his splenic lac?

35:13.670 --> 35:15.468
Well, yeah, that's what
I was worried about.

35:15.470 --> 35:16.470
(BEEPS)

35:17.749 --> 35:18.816
That's what's happened.

35:18.818 --> 35:20.098
That spleen's got to
come out immediately.

35:20.100 --> 35:21.355
Whatever is going on with Dax

35:21.357 --> 35:22.784
is causing him to become coagulopathic.

35:22.786 --> 35:25.120
Well, clotting issues aside...

35:25.122 --> 35:27.105
we got to get him to the OR stat.

35:27.107 --> 35:29.547
- I hope there's time to save his life.
- All right, let's go.

35:33.464 --> 35:35.806
Hey. Hey. What is this?

35:35.808 --> 35:37.397
Patients who have been
sitting in the ER hallways

35:37.399 --> 35:39.042
for hours, waiting for a
bed on the medicine floor.

35:39.044 --> 35:41.395
A hallway in the ER
versus a hallway here.

35:41.397 --> 35:43.870
- What's the difference?
- Proximity.

35:43.872 --> 35:45.999
Doctors tend to forget about
these patients even though,

35:46.001 --> 35:47.500
technically, they're on their lists.

35:47.502 --> 35:49.794
Out of sight, out of mind.
A patient almost died today

35:49.796 --> 35:51.170
because she fell through the cracks.

35:51.172 --> 35:52.981
Administration won't allow this.

35:52.983 --> 35:55.174
It'll go back to the
way it was tomorrow.

35:55.176 --> 35:56.634
Maybe.

35:56.636 --> 35:58.177
But at least today, these patients,

35:58.179 --> 35:59.363
they won't be forgotten.

36:07.314 --> 36:09.689
BELL: We're slightly off
the midline to the fascia,

36:09.691 --> 36:12.483
- 'cause I see rectus muscle.
- AUSTIN: Agreed.

36:12.485 --> 36:14.360
Wait. Hold up.

36:14.362 --> 36:16.029
Lac.

36:16.031 --> 36:18.590
Peep the color.

36:20.177 --> 36:22.327
That doesn't even look like muscle.

36:22.329 --> 36:23.828
It's more pale than usual.

36:23.830 --> 36:25.013
AUSTIN: And look at that.

36:25.015 --> 36:26.998
It barely twitched.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.335
Well, that's odd, given
Dax's athletic background.

36:30.337 --> 36:32.596
I think we've hit the part of
the story where we find answers.

36:32.598 --> 36:35.691
Conrad? You there?

36:35.693 --> 36:39.194
I am with you every step of the way.

36:39.196 --> 36:42.889
I know what's wrong with Dax.

36:42.891 --> 36:46.159
You'll need a muscle biopsy to confirm.

36:49.397 --> 36:52.449
Mr. Landry. Hey.

36:52.451 --> 36:56.694
So, it turns out that Dax has a
genetic mitochondrial disorder.

36:56.696 --> 36:58.327
BELL: And that occurs when mitochondria

36:58.329 --> 36:59.664
fails to produce enough energy

36:59.666 --> 37:02.533
for the body to function properly.

37:02.535 --> 37:05.387
When Dax went pro, he started
doing intermittent fasting.

37:05.389 --> 37:09.466
It triggered his disorder and it
exacerbated his trauma symptoms.

37:09.468 --> 37:10.967
Is it treatable?

37:10.969 --> 37:13.025
With a specialized diet and supplements,

37:13.027 --> 37:15.138
it's likely he'll be
able to continue to play.

37:15.140 --> 37:17.733
- I can't thank you both enough.
- AUSTIN: Uh,

37:17.735 --> 37:19.901
we aren't the only
ones you should thank.

37:19.903 --> 37:22.720
BELL: We didn't make
the diagnosis alone.

37:22.722 --> 37:25.198
Conrad Hawkins was an integral part.

37:26.197 --> 37:28.172
Really?

37:36.828 --> 37:38.903
Mr. Landry?

37:38.905 --> 37:41.331
I heard what you did for Dax.

37:41.333 --> 37:43.449
I owe you a debt of thanks.

37:43.451 --> 37:45.915
Oh. Glad I could help.

37:45.917 --> 37:48.685
I also heard that Dax brought you in

37:48.687 --> 37:51.791
because our team doctor
didn't address his concerns.

37:51.793 --> 37:53.176
That's unacceptable.

37:53.178 --> 37:56.179
My players are like family to me.

37:56.181 --> 37:59.441
And this has shown me that
my family needs a doctor.

37:59.443 --> 38:02.110
I'd like that doctor to be you.

38:02.112 --> 38:03.945
(LAUGHS)

38:05.140 --> 38:07.807
Is, is this is a real offer?

38:07.809 --> 38:10.452
It is. I don't think I'll have a problem

38:10.454 --> 38:12.262
getting you a position at St. John's.

38:14.107 --> 38:18.043
So, Dr. Hawkins, what do you say?

38:30.882 --> 38:34.976
Hawkins, what are you doing here?

38:34.978 --> 38:36.836
I thought you'd like to
know I've just been hired

38:36.838 --> 38:39.389
as the new team doctor for Georgia FC.

38:39.391 --> 38:43.176
Physical therapy, medical tests,
referrals, orthopedic surgery.

38:43.178 --> 38:47.564
It's the prestige and money

38:47.566 --> 38:50.158
of a partnership with
a major sports team.

38:50.160 --> 38:54.996
Now, all of this will
remain at St. John's,

38:54.998 --> 39:00.502
unless there's another
hospital I decide to call home.

39:00.504 --> 39:04.697
Do you want Chastain
to be that hospital?

39:04.699 --> 39:09.511
Or should I just let Red Rock know

39:09.513 --> 39:12.663
you let this golden goose
slip through your fingers?

39:12.665 --> 39:14.182
You're bluffing.

39:14.184 --> 39:17.529
Bill Landry has a
contract with St. John's.

39:17.531 --> 39:19.336
A contract his lawyers
say he can get out of

39:19.338 --> 39:20.838
with a few quick phone calls,

39:20.840 --> 39:23.674
given what happened to Dax Ramsey.

39:23.676 --> 39:27.512
If I were to agree to this,
what would be the terms,

39:27.514 --> 39:29.680
moving forward?

39:29.682 --> 39:31.908
Well, you and I hug it out...

39:34.187 --> 39:37.947
... and then I decide

39:37.949 --> 39:41.951
which physicians treat
and consult Georgia FC

39:41.953 --> 39:45.422
and I monitor every aspect of team care.

39:46.625 --> 39:49.217
I'm chief resident.

39:49.219 --> 39:51.869
And I'm gonna do
whatever I think is best

39:51.871 --> 39:54.639
for my patients here at Chastain.

39:55.875 --> 39:57.375
<i>(CORK POPS)</i>

39:57.377 --> 39:59.877
- I love it. Yes, yes.
- (LAUGHS)

39:59.879 --> 40:02.213
I can't believe you pulled this off.

40:02.215 --> 40:04.508
I wish I could've seen the
look on Logan Kim's face.

40:04.510 --> 40:06.810
Oh, if you were truly
our friend, you would have

40:06.812 --> 40:08.594
recorded it so we can play it on a loop.

40:08.596 --> 40:10.480
(LAUGHTER)

40:10.482 --> 40:12.088
I have to admit, it was pretty great,

40:12.090 --> 40:13.946
but this is just the beginning.

40:13.948 --> 40:17.064
He's right. We still
have a lot of work to do.

40:17.066 --> 40:19.122
Like ousting our corporate overlords.

40:19.124 --> 40:20.916
- Which won't be an easy task.
- True,

40:20.918 --> 40:24.402
but we will get it done, together.

40:24.404 --> 40:26.329
Agreed.

40:26.331 --> 40:31.551
But first, we need to do
something about your wardrobe.

40:34.435 --> 40:36.249
Welcome home, Conrad.

40:36.251 --> 40:39.634
(LAUGHTER)

40:39.636 --> 40:41.269
(SHOUTS)

40:41.271 --> 40:43.605
- Yeah! All right.
- (LAUGHTER)

40:45.183 --> 40:48.276
(LAUGHS, GRUNTS) Yeah!

40:49.521 --> 40:51.596
(WHOOPS)

40:51.598 --> 40:52.638
- Mwah.
- Thank you.

40:52.640 --> 40:53.782
Still looks good.

40:53.784 --> 40:55.992
A toast.

40:55.994 --> 40:58.644
Here's to another day in the trenches.

40:58.646 --> 41:00.479
- (HUNDLEY WHOOPS)
- I'll drink to that.

41:00.481 --> 41:01.862
- Cheers.
- HUNDLEY: Cheers.

41:01.864 --> 41:03.274
It's good to have you back.

41:03.276 --> 41:05.752
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

41:08.781 --> 41:10.615
(SIGHS)

41:10.617 --> 41:15.136
I'm sorry I wasn't there
to celebrate with you.

41:15.138 --> 41:17.330
After the day you've had,

41:17.332 --> 41:19.498
I'm the last person
you should think about.

41:19.500 --> 41:21.309
(EXHALES)

41:24.505 --> 41:25.705
Kyle has a long road ahead,

41:25.707 --> 41:27.148
but you don't have
to do this alone, Nic.

41:27.150 --> 41:28.775
Whatever happens, I'm here.

41:30.678 --> 41:33.488
Hey. What did I say?

41:33.490 --> 41:36.533
Exactly what I needed to hear.

41:38.570 --> 41:40.829
Oh. Oh, hey, sorry.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.330
Sorry, I just... (STAMMERS)

41:42.332 --> 41:44.614
Do you...? I-Is it
okay if I borrow this?

41:44.616 --> 41:46.167
- I kind of already stuck my...
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

41:46.169 --> 41:48.244
You can keep it. You
got everything you need?

41:48.246 --> 41:52.156
Uh, yeah, yeah. You got snacks,
you got tunes, you got road map.

41:52.158 --> 41:56.202
I think we are good to go.

41:56.204 --> 41:58.704
Well, if you need anything...

41:58.706 --> 42:00.265
(QUIETLY): Yeah.

42:02.335 --> 42:04.928
Hey, so... you-you think
this place in Savannah,

42:04.930 --> 42:07.171
you really, you really
think they can help me?

42:07.173 --> 42:08.523
NIC: It's one of the best

42:08.525 --> 42:10.549
inpatient centers in the country.

42:10.551 --> 42:12.510
It's a psych joint. I get it, but good.

42:12.512 --> 42:14.195
Whatever it takes.

42:16.942 --> 42:19.275
I really want to be there
for all those moments

42:19.277 --> 42:21.077
that you talked about.

42:22.188 --> 42:24.563
Me, too.

42:24.565 --> 42:25.665
Come on.

42:27.619 --> 42:29.360
(MUTTERS)

42:29.362 --> 42:30.462
Call me on the way?

42:52.593 --> 42:54.811
We can all help prevent suicide.

42:54.813 --> 42:57.409
The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline

of local crisis centers

43:00.312 --> 43:04.103

and emotional distress
