00:02.436 --> 00:03.371
Previously on <i>The Equalizer...</i>

00:03.471 --> 00:04.472
Marcus! It's gonna be okay.

00:04.572 --> 00:05.906
I'm here for you.

00:06.006 --> 00:07.741
Whenever you need me.

00:08.742 --> 00:09.843
You know I recently
went through something

00:09.943 --> 00:11.379
I didn't think
I'd make it back from.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.813
<i>And you know who
helped me do that?</i>

00:12.913 --> 00:14.082
<i>Your mom.</i>

00:14.182 --> 00:16.217
It's about me
and my mom.

00:16.317 --> 00:17.485
I asked her to train me.

00:17.585 --> 00:19.053
You know, how
to protect myself.

00:19.153 --> 00:20.754
I don't want you
to worry about that stuff.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.490
I had to grow up way faster
than I should've.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.058
And I don't
want that for you.

00:24.158 --> 00:25.193
And she said no?

00:25.293 --> 00:26.260
Which is why

00:26.360 --> 00:27.928
I came here to ask:

00:28.028 --> 00:29.097
will you train me?

00:29.197 --> 00:30.264
<i>She's going to do it</i>

00:30.364 --> 00:31.632
with or without me.

00:31.732 --> 00:32.833
If Delilah is not ready

00:32.933 --> 00:34.102
when the time comes,

00:34.202 --> 00:35.669
that will be my fault.

00:35.769 --> 00:38.139
As much as I
might regret it,

00:38.239 --> 00:39.373
I'd regret it more if I didn't.

00:39.473 --> 00:40.374
So...
You'll train me?

00:40.474 --> 00:42.310
Yeah.
Oh, my God.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.042
Taylor?

01:49.143 --> 01:50.378
Hey.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.995
Something smells good in here.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.730
Whoo.

02:10.664 --> 02:11.965
Don't even
think about it.

02:12.065 --> 02:15.469
It's a 12-hour bolognese
and you are four hours early.

02:15.569 --> 02:17.838
You'll have to wait till
dinner to taste it.

02:17.938 --> 02:20.140
The only question
to be answered is

02:20.241 --> 02:23.744
what do you want it over,
penne or rigatoni?

02:23.844 --> 02:25.246
You decide.
Pasta's pasta.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.781
It's just a vehicle
for this sauce.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.083
Pasta...

02:30.184 --> 02:33.621
is the foundation
for every respectable

02:33.721 --> 02:35.189
Italian dish.

02:35.289 --> 02:36.757
I don't disagree with you,

02:36.857 --> 02:39.527
but sometimes maybe the pasta
gets a little too much credit.

02:39.627 --> 02:41.495
The sauce is the one
doing all the work.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.198
You know what?
Let's ask Dee.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.866
I bet you
she's Team Sauce.

02:45.966 --> 02:48.336
And it's a good thing she left
early so she doesn't have to

02:48.436 --> 02:50.738
hear your crazy talk.

02:50.838 --> 02:52.973
School's not
for another hour.

02:53.073 --> 02:53.974
Where'd she go?

02:54.074 --> 02:56.009
I'm not sure.

02:56.109 --> 02:58.446
I didn't ask.

03:03.751 --> 03:05.219
She's gonna be Team Sauce.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.687
I know it.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.256
Hey, it's Dee.
Leave a message.

03:08.356 --> 03:09.290
Hmm.

03:09.390 --> 03:10.558
Went straight to voice mail.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.527
And her notifications
are silenced.

03:15.095 --> 03:16.497
She's a teen.

03:16.597 --> 03:19.600
I'm sure she just forgot
to turn them back on.

03:20.834 --> 03:22.570
Yeah, maybe you're right.

03:23.371 --> 03:24.938
I got to get to work.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.575
Listen, when you talk
to, uh, Delilah,

03:27.675 --> 03:29.377
can you just tell her

03:29.477 --> 03:30.544
to give me a call later,

03:30.644 --> 03:32.079
give me a shout?
Mm-hmm. I will.

03:32.179 --> 03:33.847
I'm sure she's gonna be
just fine, Mama Bear.

03:33.947 --> 03:34.848
Girl!

03:34.948 --> 03:36.917
Mm!
Get out of my pot.

03:37.017 --> 03:37.985
Mm.

03:38.085 --> 03:39.019
Lord.

03:39.119 --> 03:40.388
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

03:40.488 --> 03:41.755
No pasta needed.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.557
It's all about
that sauce.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.764
Taylor was 17.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.168
She had her whole life
ahead of her.

03:55.936 --> 03:58.739
You said she died
of an overdose?

03:59.673 --> 04:01.709
That's what
the autopsy said.

04:01.809 --> 04:05.045
They told me she took
a pill laced with fentanyl.

04:06.647 --> 04:08.081
Any history of drug use?

04:08.181 --> 04:10.050
Not that I know of.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.087
She was a good kid.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.723
Straight A student.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.958
Played varsity on
the tennis team.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.460
I mean...

04:19.560 --> 04:23.130
It's possible there were things
she was keeping from me.

04:24.498 --> 04:26.600
I mean, she was supposed to be
at a sleepover that night,

04:26.700 --> 04:28.001
not some club in Brooklyn.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.538
Any idea where she
might've gotten the pills?

04:31.372 --> 04:32.606
Her friend, Sienna,

04:32.706 --> 04:34.742
said some guy at the club
gave them the pills.

04:34.842 --> 04:37.445
We talked about the
dangers of drugs.

04:37.545 --> 04:39.380
She promised me that
she wouldn't do them

04:39.480 --> 04:40.381
and I believed her.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.882
I really thought

04:41.982 --> 04:43.884
she would make good choices,
you know?

04:46.019 --> 04:47.955
Hey, we do the best
we can as parents.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.526
What about the police?
What do they have so far?

04:52.626 --> 04:54.261
Not much.

04:54.362 --> 04:56.630
They claim they're looking for
the man who gave her the pill,

04:56.730 --> 04:58.098
but they're not optimistic.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.735
My younger daughter, Wendy...

05:01.835 --> 05:03.170
is a wreck.

05:05.172 --> 05:06.340
How old is she?

05:06.440 --> 05:07.375
She's 12.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.276
She's not sleeping.

05:09.377 --> 05:10.778
She's not eating.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.946
She misses her sister so much.

05:15.749 --> 05:18.218
I couldn't save Taylor.

05:19.353 --> 05:22.590
How do I make sure the same
thing doesn't happen to Wendy?

05:24.625 --> 05:25.526
Please find the man

05:25.626 --> 05:27.227
who killed my daughter.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.129
He needs to pay
for what he's done.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.931
Trust me,

05:31.031 --> 05:33.601
we're gonna get
justice for Taylor.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.670
So young.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.506
She was in a senior
in high school.

05:38.606 --> 05:40.508
It's becoming an epidemic.

05:40.608 --> 05:41.909
We know cartels
cut their drugs

05:42.009 --> 05:43.377
with something cheaper
to stretch their supply.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.745
It used to be aspirin,

05:44.845 --> 05:46.780
even baby powder,
and now it's fentanyl.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.549
50 times more powerful
than heroin.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.550
In a single batch of pills,

05:49.650 --> 05:50.951
there can be some pills

05:51.051 --> 05:52.486
that have no trace of fentanyl,

05:52.586 --> 05:54.555
and then still others
that are completely lethal.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.056
Which explains why Taylor died

05:56.156 --> 05:57.925
and her friend
Sienna didn't.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.192
Police interviewed
Sienna at the club.

05:59.292 --> 06:01.061
She said some guy
gave them the pills

06:01.161 --> 06:02.596
and they thought it
was just ecstasy.

06:02.696 --> 06:03.897
Club has surveillance,

06:03.997 --> 06:05.298
but it's conveniently
out of order.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.100
However, if there's
one thing I've learned

06:07.200 --> 06:08.836
from watching <i>Keeping Up
with the Kardashians,</i>

06:08.936 --> 06:11.204
if it wasn't posted to social
media, it didn't happen.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.673
So, I got some bots

06:12.773 --> 06:16.243
scanning #Club25Hours for
the night that Taylor died.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.978
Maybe something will come
up with her and Sienna

06:18.078 --> 06:19.713
and this mystery guy.

06:19.813 --> 06:21.849
And here I thought your reality
TV addiction was a bad thing.

06:21.949 --> 06:23.183
Don't be a hater.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.953
You could not pay me

06:26.053 --> 06:27.020
to be a teenager these days.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.889
The stuff we did

06:28.989 --> 06:30.858
as kids was crazy,

06:30.958 --> 06:32.059
but we didn't die over it.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.260
Yeah.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.528
When I think about Dee,

06:34.628 --> 06:35.863
I feel like
I've taught her everything

06:35.963 --> 06:37.731
she needs to know
to make a good decision.

06:37.831 --> 06:39.600
So did
Taylor's mom.

06:39.700 --> 06:40.901
Maybe it turns out
she was out here

06:41.001 --> 06:42.235
doing this all
behind her mother's back.

06:42.335 --> 06:43.437
Well, Dee has
a good head

06:43.537 --> 06:45.005
on her shoulders.

06:45.105 --> 06:46.206
You don't need
to worry about her.

06:48.208 --> 06:48.976
I got something.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.310
In the background there.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.181
Taylor and Sienna.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.018
Is that our guy?

06:58.118 --> 06:59.953
Run it through
the DMV database...

07:02.422 --> 07:03.390
Got him.

07:03.491 --> 07:04.492
Danilo Jimenez.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.026
I'll reach out
to Dante,

07:06.126 --> 07:07.861
see if he can
confirm with Sienna

07:07.961 --> 07:09.530
that this is the guy
who gave them the drugs.

07:09.630 --> 07:11.131
And while you do that,

07:11.231 --> 07:12.466
I'm gonna pay
this Danilo a visit.

08:21.201 --> 08:23.270
You call this in?

08:23.370 --> 08:24.404
No.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.839
But once I heard the sirens,

08:25.939 --> 08:27.641
I figured I'd better
get on out of there.

08:27.741 --> 08:29.242
So you think this
Danilo is your guy?

08:29.342 --> 08:30.778
At first.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.446
He only had a small
amount of drugs on him.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.116
Looks like
personal use.

08:36.216 --> 08:37.417
Probably to share with

08:37.517 --> 08:38.686
cute girls at the club.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.654
Man, we used to just
buy them a drink.

08:40.754 --> 08:41.989
Yeah, and they didn't die
from it.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.692
Looks like candy.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.427
No wonder they're so
enticing to kids.

08:48.862 --> 08:49.963
You reach out
to Sienna

08:50.063 --> 08:51.264
about Danilo's identity?

08:51.364 --> 08:53.100
Her family isn't
answering their phones.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.334
If we want
answers from her,

08:54.434 --> 08:55.836
we're gonna need
to pay them a visit.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.640
Well, this guy was beaten
and shot.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.174
Somebody wanted him to suffer.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.175
Drug deal gone wrong?

09:02.275 --> 09:03.310
Maybe.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.479
I found Danilo's
phone on a table.

09:09.482 --> 09:11.051
How'd you unlock it?

09:11.151 --> 09:12.119
Used his thumb.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.224
No obvious texts
about scoring drugs,

09:17.324 --> 09:18.291
but he did get one yesterday

09:18.391 --> 09:20.093
from someone named Blake.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.596
"Keep your mouth shut. Or else."

09:22.696 --> 09:24.064
Sounds like a threat.

09:24.164 --> 09:25.298
Could be his dealer.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.566
Maybe he
was worried

09:26.667 --> 09:28.235
Danilo was gonna
talk to the cops

09:28.335 --> 09:29.870
and didn't want to go down
for Taylor's death.

09:29.970 --> 09:32.139
Well, let's find him
and find out.

09:37.978 --> 09:39.146
Looks like
you didn't get out

09:39.246 --> 09:40.480
of that apartment
fast enough.

09:40.580 --> 09:41.715
A BOLO was just put out

09:41.815 --> 09:43.150
for a woman matching
your description

09:43.250 --> 09:45.185
as a person of interest
in Danilo's murder.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.488
Someone must've seen me
go into that apartment.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.590
You need to lie low until
we catch the real killer.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.860
Yeah, I'll try
to fly under the radar.

09:53.827 --> 09:55.929
But I need to keep working this.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.236
You get Jimenez?

10:03.336 --> 10:05.305
No, someone killed him
before I got here.

10:05.405 --> 10:06.439
Look, I'm here with Dante.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.676
I need you to run
a number for me.

10:08.776 --> 10:09.910
212-555-

10:10.010 --> 10:11.845
0198.

10:11.945 --> 10:13.847
Well, the bad news is
it's a burner.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.215
Good news is,

10:15.315 --> 10:16.784
they weren't smart enough
to turn off their GPS.

10:16.884 --> 10:19.352
Great. Send us the location.

10:22.756 --> 10:23.791
Blake.

10:24.758 --> 10:26.660
Who's asking?
NYPD.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.899
What do you want?

10:31.999 --> 10:35.235
You texted a man named
Danilo Jimenez yesterday.

10:35.335 --> 10:36.369
So?

10:36.469 --> 10:37.637
So, he was beaten

10:37.738 --> 10:39.639
and shot to death
this morning.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.274
Would you know
anything about that?

10:41.374 --> 10:42.876
Danilo's dead?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.078
We have reason to
believe he gave ecstasy pills

10:45.178 --> 10:47.647
laced with fentanyl to a girl
in this club a few days ago,

10:47.748 --> 10:48.749
and it killed her.

10:48.849 --> 10:50.517
That had nothing to do with me.

10:50.617 --> 10:52.052
I swear. I'm just
the bouncer.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.221
Then why'd you send him
a threatening text?

10:55.188 --> 10:57.524
Danilo used to slip me
some cash to sneak

10:57.624 --> 10:58.692
underage girls
in the club.

10:58.792 --> 10:59.993
Like Taylor Schwartz,

11:00.093 --> 11:01.594
the girl who died?

11:01.695 --> 11:03.396
I didn't want Danilo telling
the police that I let her in.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.965
I need this job.

11:05.065 --> 11:07.400
I take care of my mom,
she got dementia.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.435
It's why I hustle
here and there,

11:08.535 --> 11:10.170
for extra paper.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.571
Okay, so if you
didn't give him the drugs,

11:11.671 --> 11:13.540
where'd they come from?

11:13.640 --> 11:14.875
I don't know.

11:14.975 --> 11:16.309
I mean, he said
he bought them online.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.544
Where'd the handoff take
place? Inside the club?

11:17.644 --> 11:18.746
If it did, I didn't see it.

11:18.846 --> 11:20.113
I'm posted at
this door all night.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.414
Y'all can check.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.151
<i>Selling drugs
through social media</i>

11:24.251 --> 11:26.053
is a huge problem.

11:26.153 --> 11:28.789
It's almost impossible
to track the dealers.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.223
Just when you
shut one down,

11:30.323 --> 11:32.092
another one pops up
under a different name.

11:32.192 --> 11:34.061
Yeah, so many kids on there.
It just makes them easy prey.

11:34.161 --> 11:36.830
My oldest one's on
those sites all the time.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.365
I try to tell him
about the dangers,

11:38.465 --> 11:40.067
but I don't know if he hears me.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.234
Delilah, either.

11:41.902 --> 11:44.071
I swear, sometimes
I wish I could just

11:44.171 --> 11:46.573
take her somewhere in a tower
and lock her away.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.408
Take her phone away. Exactly.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.413
We got to find these pills
and get them off the street

11:53.513 --> 11:54.948
before anyone else dies.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.751
Department finally got ahold
of Taylor's friend, Sienna.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.286
I'll see if she
remembers anything else.

11:59.386 --> 12:00.620
Maybe she saw someone

12:00.720 --> 12:02.589
give Danilo drugs
at the club that night.

12:02.689 --> 12:04.858
And I'll have Harry check
the phone log and emails.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.060
There has to be
some record of the buy.

12:07.828 --> 12:09.496
<i>All right, so Danilo Jimenez</i>

12:09.596 --> 12:11.198
corresponded with
his drug dealer

12:11.298 --> 12:12.732
mostly through social media.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.134
It's a good way to do
these sorts of transactions.

12:14.234 --> 12:15.635
You know, you don't
have to give out

12:15.735 --> 12:17.070
any personal information,

12:17.170 --> 12:19.239
and, you know,
it feels relatively anonymous.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.174
But there's always a trail.

12:21.274 --> 12:22.675
Yeah, digital breadcrumbs.

12:22.776 --> 12:23.710
Exactly.

12:23.811 --> 12:25.345
So, I analyzed how much time

12:25.445 --> 12:26.780
Danilo spent on each app.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.615
And it looks like his
go-to was, uh, SnapBlink.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.884
That's probably where
he bought the drugs.

12:30.984 --> 12:32.385
It's all written in emoji,
it looks like some kind of code.

12:32.485 --> 12:34.888
Yeah, it's easy to deny
culpability, you know,

12:34.988 --> 12:36.756
if you don't actually say
the word "drugs."

12:36.857 --> 12:38.025
Look at all these DMs.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.727
If these are
drug transactions,

12:40.828 --> 12:42.996
it looks like he was buying
from multiple dealers.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.031
How will we know

12:44.131 --> 12:45.799
where he got the tainted pills?

12:45.899 --> 12:47.600
All we got to do is figure out
which one of these emojis

12:47.700 --> 12:49.102
means ecstasy.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.470
Okay.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.439
Well, don't look at me.
I don't speak emoji.

12:52.539 --> 12:54.741
Well, can't you look it up?
I mean, that's the thing.

12:54.842 --> 12:56.243
They're constantly changing.

12:56.343 --> 12:57.911
It's another way the dealers
cover their tracks.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.379
There's got to be some way
to figure this out.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.514
It's like we've reverted back
to some ancient

13:01.614 --> 13:02.615
form of hieroglyphics.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.051
So, everyday
kids can outwit

13:04.151 --> 13:06.386
the CIA's
most-wanted hacker?

13:06.486 --> 13:07.787
Sad, but true.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.556
Harry, send me
a copy of those DMs.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.391
I think I know
someone who can help.

13:15.395 --> 13:16.563
May I come in?

13:16.663 --> 13:18.731
Uh, yeah.

13:20.400 --> 13:21.634
You on the phone?

13:21.734 --> 13:24.071
I thought
I heard voices.

13:24.171 --> 13:25.705
Oh, uh, no.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.440
It was just, you know,
funny YouTube videos.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.808
But, uh, what's up?

13:28.909 --> 13:30.177
I need your help
on something.

13:30.277 --> 13:33.013
Can you tell me
what these emojis mean?

13:34.915 --> 13:36.016
Why are you asking?

13:36.116 --> 13:37.217
It's for a case.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.752
Some guy used them
to buy drugs online.

13:39.853 --> 13:42.122
I need to know which
one means ecstasy.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.757
That one.

13:47.227 --> 13:47.961
You sure?

13:48.061 --> 13:49.096
Yeah, E is a party drug.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.398
So, the star and
the lightning bolt

13:51.498 --> 13:52.866
shows a quick way to blast off.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.269
Should I be worried
that you know this?

13:57.404 --> 13:58.705
Mom...

13:59.572 --> 14:00.974
I'm not doing drugs, okay?

14:01.074 --> 14:03.877
Trust me, most kids at school
know what those emojis mean.

14:03.977 --> 14:06.313
Because they're using?

14:06.413 --> 14:09.016
No, not all of them.

14:09.816 --> 14:11.084
Okay, I have like two friends

14:11.184 --> 14:12.953
who bought Adderall
to help them study.

14:13.053 --> 14:14.787
I'm not giving you names,
so don't ask.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.290
Okay. Fine.

14:22.795 --> 14:24.131
Dee...

14:25.198 --> 14:29.569
Some of these... street drugs

14:29.669 --> 14:31.604
are laced with fentanyl.

14:32.772 --> 14:36.676
Now, you can't look at a pill
and tell if it's in there.

14:36.776 --> 14:39.346
But if there's a tiny amount,

14:39.446 --> 14:42.749
I'm talking about
two grains of sand,

14:42.849 --> 14:44.084
it can be fatal.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.420
I get it, Mom.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.757
I'm not doing drugs.

14:50.857 --> 14:53.160
Okay? I swear.
It's not my thing.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.462
Good.

14:56.463 --> 14:57.931
I hope so.

15:01.701 --> 15:03.303
Hey.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.773
Aunt Vi is cooking her
special bolognese for dinner,

15:06.873 --> 15:08.175
and we got into a debate.

15:08.275 --> 15:10.043
Now, which is
more important?

15:10.143 --> 15:12.345
The pasta or the sauce?

15:14.481 --> 15:15.715
Both.

15:17.084 --> 15:18.618
I mean, you can't have
one without the other.

15:18.718 --> 15:20.420
Diplomat.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.588
Dinner will be ready soon.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.392
Um, actually, Mom,
I was wondering if...

15:25.492 --> 15:27.227
I could go out to eat?

15:28.461 --> 15:29.362
With who?

15:29.462 --> 15:30.830
Just friends.

15:37.804 --> 15:39.372
Okay.

15:40.740 --> 15:41.774
Don't be home too late.

15:41.874 --> 15:44.144
I won't. I promise.

15:54.421 --> 15:55.722
According to McCall,

15:55.822 --> 15:58.058
this is the thread that
Danilo used to buy the drugs.

15:58.158 --> 15:59.492
Can you ID
the dealer?

16:01.694 --> 16:02.595
No.

16:02.695 --> 16:03.963
It's untraceable.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.833
There is one way
to draw him out.

16:06.933 --> 16:08.235
Set up a buy.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.370
Use the app
to order some drugs. Yeah.

16:10.470 --> 16:14.307
When the dealer comes
to deliver them, we grab him.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.512
Look at me,
scoring some E.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.082
How's it feel to be
married to a bad boy?

16:22.182 --> 16:24.051
I like you better
as a nerd.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.391
Well, it looks like
we've got some company.

16:31.491 --> 16:34.127
Aren't drug dealers supposed
to look, like, all dangerous?

16:34.227 --> 16:35.995
The guy's, like,
head to toe in spandex.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.834
Uh, Studmaster528?

16:41.934 --> 16:43.636
Studmaster528? Really?

16:43.736 --> 16:45.072
Yeah, that's me.

16:50.443 --> 16:51.978
Hey, uh, listen.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.580
Uh, we were
thinking about having

16:53.680 --> 16:55.348
a little, uh, party later on.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.117
And I wanted to, uh,

16:57.217 --> 16:58.385
see if I could score
a little extra for my homies.

16:58.485 --> 16:59.786
Sorry, I can't
help you with that.

16:59.886 --> 17:00.820
I'm just a messenger.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.490
I like that.
I like what you did,

17:03.590 --> 17:04.657
that little play on words.

17:04.757 --> 17:06.593
You a writer in
your spare time?

17:06.693 --> 17:08.428
No. I'm a bike messenger.

17:09.129 --> 17:11.030
Oh, right, right, yeah.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.899
Well, speaking of which,

17:12.999 --> 17:14.234
that is a dope bike.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.735
What is that thing?
That looks like--

17:15.835 --> 17:17.437
What is that, like a 20-speed?
Ten.

17:17.537 --> 17:20.307
Ten? Really? That?
Looks powerful.

17:20.407 --> 17:22.509
Wh-What's the top speed
you get on that bad boy?

17:22.609 --> 17:23.776
Dude, I got to go.

17:23.876 --> 17:24.944
Oh.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.479
I was wondering
what you were doing.

17:26.579 --> 17:28.815
You cloned his phone,
didn't you?

17:28.915 --> 17:30.783
Oh, hells yeah.

17:32.252 --> 17:33.320
Now we can follow him
wherever he goes,

17:33.420 --> 17:35.021
including back
to the dealer.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.524
I love it when you talk nerdy.

17:38.458 --> 17:39.292
Sugar?

17:39.392 --> 17:40.793
I'll give you
some sugar.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.395
Mm-hmm.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.998
Studmaster.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.535
Am I in trouble?

17:48.635 --> 17:50.170
No, no.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.871
I just have a few
questions for you

17:51.971 --> 17:54.006
about the night
Taylor died.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.176
Here, have a seat.

17:57.577 --> 17:58.978
I've already talked
to the police twice.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.148
I've told them
everything I know.

18:01.248 --> 18:02.849
Twice?

18:02.949 --> 18:04.884
At the club,
and then at my house.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.655
There's no record of a detective
coming to your house.

18:09.789 --> 18:10.823
Who was that guy?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.425
Let's figure that out.

18:12.525 --> 18:13.560
What did he ask you?

18:14.961 --> 18:16.296
He had a lot of questions

18:16.396 --> 18:18.831
about the guy who sold us
the pills at the club.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.066
His name,

18:20.167 --> 18:21.868
if we knew who he was...

18:21.968 --> 18:23.570
What did you tell him?

18:23.670 --> 18:25.672
I said that we met him.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.474
And then...

18:27.574 --> 18:29.409
Then he showed me a bunch
of pictures on his phone

18:29.509 --> 18:30.610
and asked if

18:30.710 --> 18:32.312
I saw the same guy
in any of them.

18:32.412 --> 18:33.446
Did you?

18:35.782 --> 18:36.816
Yeah.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.451
What else did he ask you?

18:40.220 --> 18:41.488
That was kind of it.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.690
Once I pointed the guy out,
he left.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.459
Can you tell me
what he looked like?

18:55.535 --> 18:56.736
He stopped again.

18:56.836 --> 18:57.737
That's the same
place as before.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.038
That's the fifth time today.

18:59.138 --> 18:59.939
That must be where
the dealer lives.

19:00.039 --> 19:01.073
Yeah.

19:01.641 --> 19:04.177
It's an apartment
in Hell's Kitchen.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.313
According to public records,
it's owned by...

19:06.413 --> 19:08.281
Kyle Howard.

19:08.381 --> 19:10.149
Now he looks dangerous.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.719
I'll tell Rob
we think we found him.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.349
Police! Don't move!

19:43.516 --> 19:44.717
Hands where
I can see them!

19:45.552 --> 19:47.654
You're
making a mistake.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.489
Put the gun down!

19:58.130 --> 20:00.032
Put the gun down!

20:00.132 --> 20:01.033
Now!

20:01.133 --> 20:02.101
Okay!

20:02.201 --> 20:04.136
The gun is down.

20:04.237 --> 20:05.472
But the real killer
is getting away.

20:05.572 --> 20:06.839
Yeah, right.

20:06.939 --> 20:08.775
Turn around and put
your hands behind your head.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.010
I got eyes on our female
vigilante suspect.

20:11.110 --> 20:12.545
Send back up
to my location now.

20:12.645 --> 20:13.946
This is not
what it looks like.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.214
I had nothing to do
with this man's death.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.349
You had nothing to do
with the guy

20:16.449 --> 20:17.517
this morning, either.

20:17.617 --> 20:18.718
Ahh!

20:18.818 --> 20:20.953
Sorry about this.

20:43.209 --> 20:44.311
Get in.

20:49.982 --> 20:52.552
This is what you call
flying under the radar?

20:52.652 --> 20:54.321
I had a chance to catch the guy.

20:54.421 --> 20:56.088
I had him dead to rights
until that cop showed up.

20:56.188 --> 20:58.257
How did he get there
so fast anyway?

20:58.358 --> 20:59.626
Someone saw an intruder

20:59.726 --> 21:00.793
entering the apartment
through a window.

21:00.893 --> 21:02.094
He was there
to investigate

21:02.194 --> 21:03.496
when he heard
gunshots and saw you,

21:03.596 --> 21:04.897
standing over a dead body.

21:04.997 --> 21:08.067
NYPD thinks you took out
Danilo and the dealer.

21:08.868 --> 21:10.437
Well, they're
wrong about me,

21:10.537 --> 21:11.638
right about the killer.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.506
Same MO as Danilo.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.041
Beaten and shot.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.743
But I think he's escalating.

21:16.843 --> 21:19.278
Blue-eyed white male,
six four, muscular build?

21:19.379 --> 21:20.447
How'd you know?

21:20.547 --> 21:21.748
Taylor's friend Sienna

21:21.848 --> 21:23.383
told me that a man posing
as a detective

21:23.483 --> 21:26.252
tried to get her to identify
the man who gave them the drugs.

21:26.353 --> 21:27.286
What is this?

21:27.387 --> 21:28.388
Some kind of vigilante

21:28.488 --> 21:29.822
waging their own war on drugs?

21:29.922 --> 21:31.157
Sure as hell
sounds like it.

21:32.258 --> 21:33.526
But all the NYPD

21:33.626 --> 21:35.094
is going to think is that
you're the vigilante.

21:35.194 --> 21:37.930
Especially after what
went down at the dealer's.

21:38.831 --> 21:40.500
Well, can the D.A.
do me a solid?

21:40.600 --> 21:43.336
Give you a pass on a double
homicide in an election year?

21:43.436 --> 21:45.037
Hell no.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.306
Well, I can't
just walk away.

21:47.407 --> 21:49.175
He needs to be stopped.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.778
Can't have someone out there

21:51.878 --> 21:53.580
taking the law
into their own hands.

21:53.680 --> 21:54.581
New York isn't
big enough

21:54.681 --> 21:56.015
for two Equalizers?

21:57.550 --> 21:59.919
He is nothing like me.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.721
He's murdering people
in cold blood.

22:01.821 --> 22:03.155
And the best way to show

22:03.255 --> 22:05.492
the NYPD that
I'm not the vigilante

22:05.592 --> 22:07.527
is by catching
the real one.

22:08.361 --> 22:10.863
Well, it looks like you and
this guy are on the same path.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.031
Well, if I can stop him

22:12.131 --> 22:13.700
and get these drugs
off the street,

22:13.800 --> 22:15.267
it's a win-win.

22:17.570 --> 22:19.005
The mask
is a nice touch.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.140
Maybe I should
make some changes.

22:21.240 --> 22:22.975
Do like a chambray
cape, perhaps.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.111
You're joking,
but this guy's no superhero.

22:25.211 --> 22:27.279
Getting rid of drug dealers is
kind of like a public service.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.981
Today he's taking out
drug dealers.

22:29.081 --> 22:30.983
Tomorrow, what? If somebody
cuts him off in traffic,

22:31.083 --> 22:33.319
he kills them, too?
The guy is unhinged.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.587
No, I know. You're right.

22:34.687 --> 22:35.722
I mean, he's obviously
super dangerous.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.123
So, how do we stop him?

22:37.223 --> 22:40.192
We stop him by finding
who he's targeting next.

22:40.292 --> 22:41.394
Right. So...

22:41.494 --> 22:44.731
Kyle Howard was arrested
for possession

22:44.831 --> 22:45.832
and for dealing, right?

22:45.932 --> 22:46.933
And he was bailed out by

22:47.033 --> 22:49.068
Josef Sidorov, right?

22:49.168 --> 22:51.137
Who's a member of the
Denisova cartel.

22:51.237 --> 22:54.106
Cartels operate like pyramids.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.909
So, at the bottom level
you have dealers

22:57.009 --> 22:58.578
like Kyle Howard.

22:58.678 --> 22:59.646
And then you
work your way

22:59.746 --> 23:00.913
towards the top
and you have

23:01.013 --> 23:03.182
distributors
and suppliers,

23:03.282 --> 23:04.517
until you get to the tippy-top,

23:04.617 --> 23:06.486
and you have
the big boss,

23:06.586 --> 23:07.820
Alexi Petrov.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.989
He looks like
a Bond villain.

23:10.490 --> 23:11.524
Yeah, well, he's ex-KGB.

23:11.624 --> 23:12.792
Dante says he's been

23:12.892 --> 23:14.561
selling stolen Russian goods

23:14.661 --> 23:16.028
on the black market.
Well, there's still
a lot of holes.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.697
We can't tell for sure

23:17.797 --> 23:19.466
who the vigilante
is going after next.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.100
No, I know. Dante's still
waiting for more intel

23:21.200 --> 23:22.702
from Narco to help
fill the holes.

23:22.802 --> 23:24.637
Okay, so, besides being a tall,

23:24.737 --> 23:28.074
blue-eyed white male who's
obviously a ruthless killer,

23:28.174 --> 23:29.976
what else do we know
about this guy?

23:30.076 --> 23:31.844
All right, well,
we know he paid a visit to

23:31.944 --> 23:33.713
Sienna Melvin, right?
So, maybe there were cameras

23:33.813 --> 23:35.414
in the area that caught
a glimpse of him.

23:36.215 --> 23:38.551
Can you pull up Danilo's
autopsy report?

23:38.651 --> 23:39.819
Yeah, what are you looking for?

23:39.919 --> 23:41.220
Wounds.

23:41.320 --> 23:43.122
You can tell a lot about
someone by how they kill.

23:43.222 --> 23:44.491
Okay.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.428
Wow.

23:49.529 --> 23:50.563
Beaten, stabbed.

23:50.663 --> 23:53.299
Shot. That's a lot of rage.

23:53.399 --> 23:54.701
Seems personal.

23:55.502 --> 23:57.236
He was stabbed
in the back through a lung.

23:57.336 --> 23:59.706
That's a Special Forces move.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.574
Danilo wouldn't have
been able to scream.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.442
This was an interrogation.

24:03.543 --> 24:04.777
Yeah.

24:07.179 --> 24:08.447
That explains the overkill.

24:08.548 --> 24:10.550
The vigilante wanted
to get information

24:10.650 --> 24:11.584
out of him before
killing him.

24:11.684 --> 24:12.685
We know he's on the trail

24:12.785 --> 24:14.086
of the drugs
that killed Taylor.

24:14.186 --> 24:15.421
Is it possible that
someone in her family

24:15.522 --> 24:17.123
is exacting
their own form of justice?

24:17.223 --> 24:18.691
Well, reach out to Taylor's mom.

24:18.791 --> 24:20.059
Find out if anybody
in the family

24:20.159 --> 24:21.427
had a military background.

24:22.562 --> 24:23.462
Hold on a sec.

24:23.563 --> 24:24.897
Hi, Aunt Vi.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.634
I'm out of fresh cream.

24:27.734 --> 24:29.268
Can you bring some home?

24:29.368 --> 24:32.438
Sure. Only if you can agree
that the sauce comes first.

24:32.539 --> 24:34.006
Forget it. I'll call Dee.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.341
Okay, yeah, all right,

24:35.441 --> 24:36.576
I'm just kidding.

24:36.676 --> 24:38.745
Hey, Aunt Vi.

24:38.845 --> 24:42.081
Dee mention anything to you
about being mad at me?

24:43.215 --> 24:45.151
No. What makes you think that?

24:45.251 --> 24:46.686
I don't know.
Something in my gut

24:46.786 --> 24:48.254
tells me she's hiding something.

24:48.354 --> 24:50.122
She's a teenager. Of course
she's not gonna tell you

24:50.222 --> 24:51.524
everything that's
going on with her.

24:51.624 --> 24:54.761
She's just trying
to become more independent.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.363
And I'm trying to respect that.

24:58.598 --> 24:59.966
Are you really?

25:00.933 --> 25:01.768
Well, what do you want me to do?

25:01.868 --> 25:02.769
Just leave her alone?

25:02.869 --> 25:03.770
Mm-hmm.

25:03.870 --> 25:06.505
One hundred percent.

25:06.606 --> 25:08.040
Honey, she's not the kind of kid

25:08.140 --> 25:10.610
who's gonna go sneaking around.

25:12.779 --> 25:14.513
Thanks, Auntie.

25:14.614 --> 25:15.682
I'll call you back.

25:15.782 --> 25:17.049
And tell Dee to get the cream.

25:17.850 --> 25:19.051
Hey, Harry.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.920
The bouncer at the club
said Danilo

25:21.020 --> 25:22.555
snuck girls in the all the time.

25:22.655 --> 25:25.157
I bet you that Sienna and Taylor

25:25.257 --> 25:28.060
weren't the only girls
he gave drugs to.

25:28.795 --> 25:30.329
Harry, run a list

25:30.429 --> 25:32.064
of all the fentanyl-related
deaths in the city

25:32.164 --> 25:33.933
over the past six months.

25:36.769 --> 25:38.237
Oh, my God.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.172
Unbelievable.

25:40.272 --> 25:41.608
Wow.

25:41.708 --> 25:44.176
Danilo worked at Club 25 Hours.

25:44.276 --> 25:47.113
Focus on that area.

25:48.581 --> 25:51.183
That dot, near the club.
Who's that?

25:51.283 --> 25:52.351
Hold on.

25:53.519 --> 25:54.386
Jessica Reid.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.488
Age 20. She died two months ago.

25:56.589 --> 25:58.257
Her body was found
a block away from the club.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.860
Was she at the club
the night she died?

26:00.960 --> 26:03.129
Let me check
her social media.

26:05.364 --> 26:06.465
Hold on.

26:06.565 --> 26:08.935
Yeah, she was at
Club 25 Hours that night.

26:09.035 --> 26:11.303
And there's Danilo.

26:12.071 --> 26:13.606
Any military
in Jessica's family?

26:15.975 --> 26:18.377
Her dad. Earl Reid.
Army Intelligence.

26:18.477 --> 26:21.513
Well, that explains how he's
been ahead of us the whole time.

26:21.614 --> 26:23.950
White, six four, blue eyes.
Could be our guy.

26:24.050 --> 26:25.952
Get this photo to Dante.

26:26.052 --> 26:27.286
See if Sienna Melvin
can identify him

26:27.386 --> 26:29.321
as the man who came to see her.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.663
Did Sienna make a positive ID?

26:36.763 --> 26:40.099
Yes. Earl Reid is definitely
our vigilante.

26:40.199 --> 26:41.701
Great. I'm on my way
to Reid's house now.

26:41.801 --> 26:42.702
Don't bother.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.170
I already went.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.472
Reid's not there, but I got
his accomplice in the box.

26:46.572 --> 26:47.840
Accomplice?

26:47.940 --> 26:50.810
Frank Metcalf. Ex-Army buddy.
They were a team.

26:50.910 --> 26:54.180
Sniper/spotter. We found weapons
and a breach plan in his car.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.816
Yeah, military bonds run deep.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.885
I think Frank's got
some skin in the game, too.

26:58.985 --> 27:01.120
He was married to
Earl Reid's ex-wife.

27:02.121 --> 27:04.223
So he's Jessica's stepfather?

27:04.991 --> 27:07.059
Damn it. Police checkpoint.

27:07.159 --> 27:08.895
Probably looking for you.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.096
Yeah, I'm sure.

27:10.196 --> 27:11.230
I'm turning around.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.431
Let me know what
you find out.

27:16.669 --> 27:19.171
I'm sorry about
what happened to Jessica.

27:19.271 --> 27:21.173
I loved her like
she was my own.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.642
But Earl? He took
it especially hard.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.211
He and Jessica
were close?

27:25.311 --> 27:27.013
After him and Debra
got divorced,

27:27.113 --> 27:29.148
he had custody
every weekend.

27:29.248 --> 27:31.150
Every Sunday was like
Daddy/Daughter Day.

27:31.250 --> 27:33.452
They'd do something special,
just the two of them.

27:34.453 --> 27:37.323
When Jessica died,
well, he fell apart.

27:37.423 --> 27:38.991
He lost his job,
he lost his apartment.

27:39.091 --> 27:40.927
All he could think about was
finding the people responsible

27:41.027 --> 27:42.829
and making them pay.

27:42.929 --> 27:44.563
I understand he's in pain,
but Earl is killing people

27:44.663 --> 27:46.699
in cold blood.
They're not people.

27:46.799 --> 27:48.134
They're scum.

27:49.802 --> 27:51.470
We found these in your trunk.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.007
You're clearly working with him.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.480
I was going to be his eyes
and ears on this mission.

28:01.580 --> 28:03.249
But now he's out there
flying blind.

28:03.349 --> 28:05.517
You can help him
by telling me where he's going.

28:07.053 --> 28:09.288
It'll all be over soon enough.

28:42.454 --> 28:45.391
You learn anything from
the breach plan Dante sent over?

28:45.491 --> 28:46.893
Kind of a crude drawing,

28:46.993 --> 28:49.228
but, uh, basically it looks like
a-a large building,

28:49.328 --> 28:51.197
uh, single story,
multiple points of entry.

28:51.297 --> 28:53.065
I mean, that's about
as much as I can tell.

28:53.165 --> 28:55.868
It could be an industrial
space, like a warehouse.

28:55.968 --> 28:57.403
Yeah, there's
plenty of those

28:57.503 --> 28:58.604
in the tri-state area.

28:58.704 --> 28:59.906
We're gonna have
to narrow it down.

29:00.006 --> 29:01.573
Well, Dante's contact
in Narcotics said

29:01.673 --> 29:03.075
the leader of the cartel,

29:03.175 --> 29:07.079
Alexi Petrov, came
into the States 48 hours ago.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.816
Flew into some private airport
near Hoboken.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.818
Well, that's who
Earl's going after.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.452
Yeah, cutting off the head
of the snake.

29:13.552 --> 29:16.088
His buddy Frank did say it
would all be over soon.

29:16.188 --> 29:18.991
Does Petrov own
any property in New Jersey?

29:19.792 --> 29:21.160
Um...

29:22.161 --> 29:24.430
There's nothing
registered under his name,

29:24.530 --> 29:25.965
but, you know, those oligarchs

29:26.065 --> 29:27.233
like to fly
under the radar.

29:27.333 --> 29:28.634
Okay, this is where
he flew into.

29:30.036 --> 29:32.771
Lots of warehouses near there
in Jersey City.

29:33.840 --> 29:36.275
Frank said he was going
to be a spotter for Earl.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.477
That means he would
need higher ground.

29:38.577 --> 29:39.778
Can you isolate the ones

29:39.879 --> 29:41.447
that are close
to multi-story buildings?

29:41.547 --> 29:42.614
Mm-hmm, yeah.

29:42.714 --> 29:44.150
Okay, uh, that
leaves us with

29:44.250 --> 29:45.117
these two.

29:45.217 --> 29:46.185
Who owns them?

29:46.285 --> 29:47.586
One is, uh,
owned by a trust.

29:47.686 --> 29:48.821
It's called
"White, Red and Blue."

29:48.921 --> 29:50.857
Colors of America and Russia. Yeah.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.458
Ironic, right?

29:52.558 --> 29:54.460
Uh, and the other one is owned
by a shell corporation.

29:54.560 --> 29:56.028
It's called Nasiliye Corp.

29:56.128 --> 29:59.031
<i>Nasiliye</i> is Russian
for "violence."

29:59.131 --> 30:00.299
Okay, so both could
be tied to Russia.

30:00.399 --> 30:01.467
Question is,
which one is Petrov's?

30:01.567 --> 30:02.969
Well, I'll take one.

30:03.069 --> 30:04.303
Mel, you take the other.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.038
Harry, you'll have to be
our eyes and ears.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.607
And whichever one it is,
it's gonna be heavily guarded.

30:08.707 --> 30:10.142
We'll be careful.

30:10.242 --> 30:14.113
Earl Reid is a dad
who lost a daughter.

30:14.213 --> 30:16.248
It's grief that's
driving this rampage.

30:16.348 --> 30:19.852
Let's find him before
any more lives are lost.

30:19.952 --> 30:22.088
Including his.

30:22.188 --> 30:23.589
Yeah.

30:23.689 --> 30:24.957
Okay.

30:31.563 --> 30:32.598
I got nothing. You?

30:37.904 --> 30:38.905
A lot of activity outside.

30:39.005 --> 30:41.340
This is definitely the place.

30:41.440 --> 30:43.042
But Earl is already here.

30:43.142 --> 30:44.776
Back door was jimmied open.

30:44.877 --> 30:48.180
I'm gonna see if I can stop him
before he gets hisself killed.

30:48.280 --> 30:49.781
All right,
don't get yourself killed.

30:49.882 --> 30:50.883
Copy that.

30:50.983 --> 30:52.218
Not planning to.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.921
Stop right there.
Who are you?

30:55.021 --> 30:56.788
Drop your weapon.

31:07.766 --> 31:09.401
Rob?

31:09.501 --> 31:10.736
Rob.

31:11.670 --> 31:13.072
Rob. What's going on?

31:32.891 --> 31:35.327
Who are you?

31:35.427 --> 31:36.562
What do you want?

31:37.629 --> 31:39.999
Well, I heard you guys
had a Russian Costco

31:40.099 --> 31:41.400
going on over here.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.602
So, where's the vodka?
Where's the caviar?

31:43.702 --> 31:45.071
You have a death wish?

31:45.171 --> 31:48.507
It's not my life
I would be worried about.

31:48.607 --> 31:49.875
It's yours.

31:49.976 --> 31:53.445
There's a man in this
building right now

31:53.545 --> 31:54.981
who's here to kill you.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.950
A man whose daughter died

31:58.050 --> 31:59.885
because of
tainted drugs

31:59.986 --> 32:01.887
you put on the streets.

32:03.789 --> 32:05.257
Ah.

32:06.792 --> 32:09.195
You came to save me?

32:15.201 --> 32:17.336
I don't give a damn about you.

32:18.104 --> 32:21.173
I'm just here to stop
a mistake from happening.

32:23.842 --> 32:25.344
Thank you for your concern.

32:25.444 --> 32:26.812
Shoot her.

32:27.346 --> 32:28.547
But do it outside.

32:28.647 --> 32:31.017
I don't want to get blood
on my Persian rug.

33:17.696 --> 33:18.597
Copy that.

33:18.697 --> 33:20.632
All clear so far.

33:39.151 --> 33:40.486
Please.

33:40.586 --> 33:43.622
Do you think
your pain matters to me?

33:46.258 --> 33:48.394
You're gonna pay
for all the pain and suffering

33:48.494 --> 33:49.861
you've caused.

33:49.961 --> 33:51.630
Please,
tell me what you want.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.465
I want you to suffer
like my daughter did.

33:53.565 --> 33:55.834
Earl, stop!

34:01.273 --> 34:02.674
Who are you? A cop?

34:02.774 --> 34:04.643
I'm someone you call
when you need justice.

34:04.743 --> 34:06.512
I'm getting my own justice.

34:06.612 --> 34:07.846
This is not the way.

34:09.047 --> 34:10.082
Red light!

34:11.717 --> 34:13.419
Bad sitrep.

34:13.519 --> 34:14.853
You're a soldier?

34:14.953 --> 34:15.987
Hoorah.

34:20.092 --> 34:22.928
This piece of trash
killed my daughter.

34:24.163 --> 34:26.498
He put those drugs on the street
and he needs to die.

34:26.598 --> 34:27.866
I know
you're hurting, Earl.

34:27.966 --> 34:29.435
You're living every parent's
worst nightmare.

34:29.535 --> 34:31.670
Then you know
he deserves no mercy.

34:31.770 --> 34:33.038
Enough bloodshed!

34:33.139 --> 34:38.144
Killing Danilo Jimenez
and Kyle Howard

34:38.244 --> 34:40.546
didn't bring your daughter back.

34:40.646 --> 34:42.013
Neither will this.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.916
I have to finish what I started.

34:46.051 --> 34:48.620
You know what he stole from me?

34:49.655 --> 34:51.757
She was gonna go to law school.

34:53.024 --> 34:55.527
Now I'll never get
to see her graduate.

34:57.396 --> 34:59.931
I'll never get
to walk her down the aisle.

35:00.899 --> 35:02.434
See her become a parent herself.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.270
He stole all that from me.
From her!

35:04.370 --> 35:06.805
Earl. Earl, I hear you.

35:06.905 --> 35:08.740
But this is not
how you get justice

35:08.840 --> 35:10.709
for your
daughter Jessica.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.612
You kill him

35:13.712 --> 35:15.747
and another snake will
replace him tomorrow.

35:15.847 --> 35:17.349
Send him to prison.

35:17.449 --> 35:18.884
We make an example out of him.

35:20.552 --> 35:21.787
Come on.

35:24.623 --> 35:25.857
You made your point.

35:34.433 --> 35:36.202
Now put the gun down.

35:46.412 --> 35:48.314
I'm sorry.

35:48.414 --> 35:49.781
It's okay.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.484
No!

35:53.852 --> 35:55.521
You don't get to die today!

36:00.726 --> 36:01.627
Hold on, Earl. Hang on.

36:01.727 --> 36:02.961
Hang on, brother.

36:03.061 --> 36:04.095
Hang on.

36:04.196 --> 36:04.963
Hold on, okay?

36:05.063 --> 36:08.667
Promise me he'll pay.

36:08.767 --> 36:11.803
No other kids will die
because of him.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.973
Hey. Hang on, Earl.

36:15.073 --> 36:17.243
It's okay.

36:17.343 --> 36:19.010
I want this.

36:20.111 --> 36:22.814
There's no life
without my little girl.

36:34.092 --> 36:36.295
Earl?

37:04.523 --> 37:06.057
You all right?

37:06.157 --> 37:08.093
Yeah.

37:08.193 --> 37:10.929
We found a mountain of evidence
in Petrov's office here.

37:11.029 --> 37:12.798
We'll be able to shut down
his organization for good.

37:12.898 --> 37:15.166
He'll be in prison
till the day he dies.

37:15.267 --> 37:16.535
Good.

37:16.635 --> 37:18.670
That man destroyed
a lot of lives.

37:18.770 --> 37:19.938
At least now
that Earl Reid's

37:20.038 --> 37:21.373
been identified
as the vigilante,

37:21.473 --> 37:24.743
you're back to flying
below NYPD's radar.

37:27.446 --> 37:29.281
Exactly where I want to be.

37:29.381 --> 37:31.182
You still knocked out
a cop, though.

37:32.784 --> 37:37.055
Cost me an expensive bottle
of Scotch to smooth that over.

37:37.923 --> 37:38.824
I owe you one.

37:38.924 --> 37:40.091
I'm keeping a tally.

37:40.191 --> 37:42.661
Oh, yeah? What's the score?

37:42.761 --> 37:45.897
I'd say letting me take you
to dinner might make us even.

37:50.536 --> 37:52.671
You a pasta or a sauce guy?

37:53.539 --> 37:54.773
That depends.

37:55.974 --> 37:58.076
I like pasta.

37:59.711 --> 38:01.813
But it's all about the sauce.

38:03.549 --> 38:05.216
Good to know.

38:06.452 --> 38:08.153

are a little safer.

39:02.774 --> 39:04.075
For now.

39:04.175 --> 39:05.611
It's only a matter of time

39:05.711 --> 39:07.579
before someone else

39:15.954 --> 39:17.155
I heard about Earl Reid

39:17.255 --> 39:20.025
and what happened
to his daughter.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.561
I thought maybe we could
light a candle

39:22.661 --> 39:23.862

Nice. It's jab, jab.

Right. Elbow. Elbow.

41:13.038 --> 41:14.405
Right. Aim this up.

41:14.506 --> 41:15.674
Elbow.

41:15.774 --> 41:17.142
Elbow.
Nice.

41:17.242 --> 41:18.309
Knee.

41:18.409 --> 41:19.310
Right. Higher.

41:19.410 --> 41:20.812
Harder.

41:20.912 --> 41:21.813

41:26.051 --> 41:27.686
Okay.
If somebody grabs you,

41:27.786 --> 41:29.487
don't think, just act.

41:31.657 --> 41:32.958
And then you pull.

41:33.058 --> 41:34.225
Ow.
Right, sorry.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.294
You got that, though?
Yeah.
