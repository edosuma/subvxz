<i>13 Bannerman Road is where</i>
<i>Sarah Jane Smith lives</i>

00:07.440 --> 00:10.744
<i>and it's home to things</i>
<i>way beyond your imagination.</i>

00:10.810 --> 00:14.180

-Ready?
-Always.

00:36.236 --> 00:37.804
(STATIC)

00:37.871 --> 00:39.773
<i>No, 'cause I had to do</i>
<i>this essay.</i>

00:39.839 --> 00:41.608
<i>Two thousand words</i>
<i>on pendulum physics.</i>

00:41.674 --> 00:43.209
<i>It was fascinating,</i>

00:43.276 --> 00:44.944
<i>but then everyone wanted</i>
<i>to go out for a burger</i>

00:45.011 --> 00:46.713
<i>and I thought, "Why not?"</i>

00:46.780 --> 00:48.648
<i>So we all went into town</i>
<i>and...</i>

00:48.715 --> 00:50.517
Well, I hope you finished
your work.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.786
<i>Oh, um... Sanjay owes me</i>
<i>5 quid, 'cause I bet him</i>
<i>you'd say that!</i>

00:52.852 --> 00:54.521
Right, and who's Sanjay?

00:54.587 --> 00:56.723
<i>Oh, he's just down the hall.</i>
<i>He's brilliant.</i>

00:56.790 --> 00:58.691
<i>We just clicked straight away.</i>

00:58.758 --> 01:00.126
<i>He's smart,</i>

01:00.193 --> 01:03.563
<i>he's cool and he keeps</i>
<i>making me laugh.</i>

01:03.630 --> 01:05.865

I'm not having soldiers on
my property.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.105
CHANDRA: Everything Okay?

01:46.172 --> 01:48.308
Yes, fine.
They're just leaving.

01:48.374 --> 01:51.277
Miss Smith,
my name is Colonel Tia Karim,

01:51.344 --> 01:54.113
representing the Unified
Intelligence Task Force.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.449
-If I could have
a word in private?
-No, no, no.

01:56.516 --> 01:59.352
You're not getting any closer.
Just tell me.
What do you want?

01:59.419 --> 02:02.922
I'm sorry, but it's my
solemn duty to inform you
that your friend,

02:02.989 --> 02:05.525
the Doctor, is dead.

02:05.592 --> 02:07.327
-Don't be stupid.
-He can't be.

02:07.393 --> 02:09.829
Last Sunday, at 1700 hours,

02:09.895 --> 02:12.532
the body of a Time Lord
was returned to the earth.

02:12.599 --> 02:16.870
UNIT scientists have
checked the DNA results,
and it's definitely him.

02:16.936 --> 02:19.472
I'm sorry, Miss Smith,
for your loss.

02:19.539 --> 02:22.876
Sorry for the whole
wide world, because he's gone.

02:24.410 --> 02:26.145
The Doctor's gone.

02:26.212 --> 02:27.514
He's dead.

02:29.148 --> 02:30.850
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:44.831 --> 02:47.166
The Doctor was found 10,000
light years away

02:47.233 --> 02:49.936
by a race called
the Shansheeth.

02:50.136 --> 02:53.773
They sent us this.
It's called an epitaph stone.

02:53.840 --> 02:56.910
It's a recording device,
the equivalent to
a death notice.

02:56.976 --> 02:59.679
The Shansheeth are
what you might call...

02:59.746 --> 03:01.347
Intergalactic undertakers.

03:01.414 --> 03:03.550
Oh, come on.
This is ridiculous!
There's no such thing!

03:03.616 --> 03:05.485
MR SMITH:
<i>Sarah Jane, I can confirm</i>

03:05.552 --> 03:07.554
<i>the Shansheeth are known</i>
<i>throughout the universe</i>

03:07.620 --> 03:09.489
<i>as the carers of the dead.</i>

03:09.556 --> 03:12.091
<i>It is said they trawl</i>
<i>the battlefields</i>
<i>of outer space,</i>

03:12.158 --> 03:13.993
<i>looking for heroes</i>
<i>to bring home.</i>

03:14.060 --> 03:16.729
Yeah? Well, that's quite
enough from you, thanks!
Just...

03:17.697 --> 03:19.866
Shut up. Play this thing.

03:25.138 --> 03:30.443
<i>I bring condolences</i>

Well...

03:34.447 --> 03:37.383
As if you'd trust that thing?
Just look at him!

03:37.450 --> 03:38.952
Hey, that's not fair.

03:39.018 --> 03:41.654
Since when did we judge
by appearances?

03:41.721 --> 03:43.856
Since this lot started lying!

03:44.791 --> 03:47.360
RANI: Okay. Look.

03:47.427 --> 03:50.830
I hope this is all
a big mistake, I really do.

03:50.897 --> 03:54.834
For the Doctor's sake
we've got to find the facts,
which means,

03:54.901 --> 03:56.869
we stop and we listen.

03:58.638 --> 04:00.373
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

04:01.574 --> 04:02.875
Mr Smith?

04:05.411 --> 04:09.549
<i>The Shansheeth did journey</i>
<i>to the wastelands</i>
<i>of the Crimson Heart,</i>

04:09.616 --> 04:14.721
<i>whereupon we found the body</i>
<i>of the last Time Lord.</i>

04:14.787 --> 04:19.926
<i>Witnesses say</i>
<i>that he perished saving</i>
<i>the lives of 500 children</i>

04:19.993 --> 04:22.462
<i>from the Scarlet Monstrosity.</i>

04:22.528 --> 04:23.963
Sounds like him.

04:24.030 --> 04:27.266
<i>The Doctor's home world</i>
<i>is long since lost.</i>

04:27.333 --> 04:31.170
<i>But legends talk</i>
<i>of his love for the earth.</i>

04:31.237 --> 04:36.009
<i>Therefore, the Shansheeth</i>
<i>will return the Doctor</i>
<i>to the human race.</i>

04:36.075 --> 04:39.746
<i>Oh, weep for him,</i>
<i>peoples of the earth.</i>

04:39.812 --> 04:45.118
<i>Mourn his loss,</i>
<i>for the universe feels</i>
<i>darker tonight.</i>

04:50.023 --> 04:52.325
So what do you think?

04:52.392 --> 04:53.926
COLONEL KARIM: UNIT will take
charge of the funeral

04:54.127 --> 04:56.529
in conjunction
with the Shansheeth.

04:56.596 --> 04:59.465
We'll be using UNIT Base 5,
situated inside Mount Snowdon.

04:59.532 --> 05:03.436
We can arrange transport and
accommodation for all of you.

05:03.503 --> 05:05.538
-SARAH JANE: Thank you.
-Then you'll come?

05:06.472 --> 05:08.307
Oh, yes.

05:08.374 --> 05:10.143
Nothing's going
to make me miss this.

05:10.743 --> 05:11.978
I'll be there.

05:15.014 --> 05:17.684
So what was that
all that about,
with the soldiers and stuff?

05:17.750 --> 05:20.720
She's weird, Sarah Jane,
there's always something
happening over...

05:20.787 --> 05:23.623
Hey, what's that for?

05:24.624 --> 05:26.693
Don't you ever go anywhere,
okay?

05:26.759 --> 05:28.394
(CHUCKLES)
Not even to the shops?

05:28.461 --> 05:29.962
Nope.

05:30.029 --> 05:31.397
Not anywhere.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.665
Promise?

05:33.533 --> 05:34.867
I promise.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.841
I always thought if ever
the Doctor dies, I'll know.

05:41.908 --> 05:45.278
Somehow I'll just feel it.

05:45.344 --> 05:50.049
Wherever he is,
if he's far away
on some distant star

05:50.116 --> 05:52.919
or lost in the depths
of dark ages,

05:53.553 --> 05:55.621
I'll know.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.391
But I didn't.
I didn't feel a thing!

05:58.458 --> 06:01.594
<i>I know, Mum, but it doesn't</i>
<i>actually mean anything.</i>

06:01.661 --> 06:04.931
No, maybe it does, though.
'Cause I don't think
he's dead.

06:04.997 --> 06:06.132
He can't be!

06:07.700 --> 06:09.836
Yeah, I'm going to go
to that funeral, Luke.

06:09.902 --> 06:12.105
But only to find out
what's going on.

06:12.171 --> 06:14.474
'Cause I think
the Doctor's still alive.

06:18.277 --> 06:20.446
Luke says
Sarah Jane's gone mad.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.315
-(WHISTLES)
-Don't be so rude.

06:22.381 --> 06:24.050
He wouldn't say "mad"
about his own mother.

06:24.117 --> 06:28.121
No. He said,
"Nutty, fruity, loop-the-loop,
tonto barmy bonkers."

06:28.187 --> 06:29.555
To be fair, though, sir,
he's worried.

06:29.622 --> 06:30.857
It's like your mum.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.592
-Remember when Grandad died?
-(GROANS)

06:32.658 --> 06:34.393
She washed everything.

06:34.460 --> 06:37.363

06:37.430 --> 06:40.800
She even washed the walls.
Who washes walls?

06:40.867 --> 06:43.903
It went on for days,
and then she just
started crying.

06:44.937 --> 06:46.305
It takes time.

06:46.372 --> 06:48.274
'Cause when someone dies
it's so massive,

06:48.341 --> 06:50.943
it's like you can't fit it all
inside your head.

06:51.010 --> 06:52.345
That's what
Sarah Jane's doing.

06:52.411 --> 06:54.280
She's denying it.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.516
So, what do we do?

06:56.582 --> 06:58.785
Wait. That's all you can do.

06:59.519 --> 07:00.853
Friends just wait.

07:07.593 --> 07:08.861
Bang on time.

07:09.729 --> 07:11.164
Oh.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.032
Don't worry, Haresh,
I'll look after them.

07:13.099 --> 07:14.867
Sorry to hear
about your bad news.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.636
There's no need. I'm fine.

08:11.357 --> 08:13.593
We've allocated bedrooms.

08:13.659 --> 08:16.729
The funeral will take place
at 0900 hours tomorrow,

08:16.796 --> 08:19.532
so that gives you time
to acclimatise.

08:19.599 --> 08:23.102
The doors to the funeral wing
will be sealed at 2100 hours.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.771
This is still
a working military base,

08:25.838 --> 08:28.541
so you'll only have access
to the specified areas.

08:28.608 --> 08:30.042
That's nice!

So who else is coming?

08:34.246 --> 08:35.982
Well, it's all been
a bit of a rush.

08:36.048 --> 08:37.783
The Brigadier's stranded
in Peru,

08:37.850 --> 08:41.153

can't make it back from
Moonbase until Sunday.

there was something going on.

08:53.933 --> 08:55.668
Sorry, what's the problem?

08:55.735 --> 08:58.471
We've met Graske before,
and believe me,
they're trouble!

08:58.537 --> 09:00.473
Oh, they're not Graske,

09:01.107 --> 09:02.475
they're Groske.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.076
Groske very different!

Groske are blue! Hate Graske!

09:06.312 --> 09:07.747
Graske make me stamp my feet!

their keep as workmen.

09:13.419 --> 09:15.821

09:15.888 --> 09:17.890
Come and see, come and see!

Rocket X-15 will take
the Doctor's body into space,

09:23.429 --> 09:26.232
sealed inside
a lead-lined coffin.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.834
Then he'll be set free.

-In death, as in life.
-Very poetic.

-What about the TARDIS?
-There was no sign of it.

09:38.611 --> 09:40.913
-The body was found all alone.

09:53.926 --> 09:56.862
Yeah, you smelly
bad smell boy.

You blue, bluey blueness.

Anyway, this area's about
to be sealed off
as part of the curfew.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.403
I can take you
to your bedrooms.

of remembrance.

He's coming!

10:27.226 --> 10:29.061
I'm so sorry for your loss.

10:31.230 --> 10:33.532
I'm so sorry for your loss.

CLYDE: (WHISPERS)
So who are all these people?

10:48.547 --> 10:49.915
Old soldiers.

10:49.982 --> 10:51.951
It's not easy to find friends
of the Doctor.

10:52.018 --> 10:55.588
He would come and go
without a trace.

10:55.654 --> 10:58.324
Think of all the lives
he touched.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.394
The whole planet should be
in mourning. But no one knows.

11:02.061 --> 11:03.596
Can I see him?

11:04.997 --> 11:07.833
I don't think you'd want to.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.935
That sounds to me like
you're hiding something.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.471
Sarah Jane, he...

11:12.538 --> 11:13.506
He was hurt.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.646
RANI: Hey!

11:20.713 --> 11:21.847
Hey, come on,
let's go sit down.

11:23.382 --> 11:24.450
I know.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.823
I don't even know what
he looks like.

11:31.457 --> 11:32.625
I'm sorry?

11:32.691 --> 11:34.660
I think he regenerated,

11:34.727 --> 11:36.595
'cause the last time I saw him

11:36.662 --> 11:40.199
he didn't say a word,
he just looked at me,
as though...

11:40.266 --> 11:42.368
That body could have
a different face,

11:42.435 --> 11:43.869
and I wouldn't even know
if it was him or not.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.944
Honoured guests
steeped in grief and misery,

11:52.011 --> 11:55.481
this is the cradle
of the lost chord.

11:55.548 --> 11:57.650
-Its bittersweet melody...
-If you don't mind,

11:57.716 --> 12:00.186
I just need to gather
my thoughts on my own.

12:00.252 --> 12:01.587
Yeah, sure.

12:02.988 --> 12:05.091
(HARP MUSIC PLAYING)

12:10.062 --> 12:11.630
Close your eyes.

12:12.865 --> 12:13.899
Remember.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.463
-Come on! Get in!
-(YELLS)

13:04.450 --> 13:06.018
-(GLASS SHATTERS)
-(GASPS)

13:06.919 --> 13:08.587
Oh, sorry, just ignore me.

13:08.654 --> 13:10.122
I brought flowers,
which was silly, really.

13:10.189 --> 13:11.223
I mean there's no need,
is there?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.192
But, well, I saw these lilies,

13:13.259 --> 13:14.994
and I thought
they were appropriate.

13:15.060 --> 13:17.796
Oh, and the vase
was so beautiful.

13:17.863 --> 13:21.167
It was hand-blown
by Asian-Argentines.

13:21.233 --> 13:23.636
Well, I don't suppose
it was actually hand-blown,

13:23.702 --> 13:25.671
because, well,
glass would get really,
really hot...

13:25.738 --> 13:27.840
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:27.907 --> 13:32.811
Oh, thank you.
Oh, aren't you lovely?

13:32.878 --> 13:34.647
I'm so sorry for your loss.

13:34.713 --> 13:36.649
I know, it's terrible,
isn't it?

13:36.715 --> 13:38.717
You are so gorgeous!

13:38.784 --> 13:41.120
Oh, I wish I had my glasses.

13:41.187 --> 13:42.855
You're like a vulture,

13:42.922 --> 13:45.824
a great, big alien vulture.

13:45.891 --> 13:48.327
Babe, aren't they wonderful?

13:48.394 --> 13:49.728
No, no, no, don't be afraid.

13:49.795 --> 13:50.996
It's just like I taught you.

13:53.399 --> 13:57.369
You know,
I've missed all this.

13:57.436 --> 13:59.505
Hey, listen, babe,
can you do something
with those for me?

13:59.572 --> 14:01.106
There's a good boy. Thanks.

14:02.141 --> 14:03.409
I'm sorry,

14:03.475 --> 14:06.545
I'm making an awful lot
of noise, aren't I?

14:06.612 --> 14:10.883
Although there is this tribe
called the Nambikwara.

14:10.950 --> 14:13.152
You know,
from the Mato Grosso.

14:13.219 --> 14:16.288
I lived there for about
six months in '83.

14:16.355 --> 14:18.991
When there's a funeral,
they sing all night.

14:19.058 --> 14:20.793
I mean, they sound like birds.

14:20.859 --> 14:23.395
Honestly, it is the most
astonishing sound
I've ever heard.

14:23.462 --> 14:25.264
(LAUGHS)

14:25.331 --> 14:27.800
Sorry, um, do I know you?

14:27.866 --> 14:29.935
We've never actually met,
but...

14:30.135 --> 14:31.870
It's Jo Grant, isn't it?

14:31.937 --> 14:34.807
Wow! It's a long time
since I've been called that.

14:34.873 --> 14:37.243
Actually it's Jo Jones
since I got married.

14:37.309 --> 14:38.811
I arrived just after you left.

14:38.877 --> 14:40.913
-You'd gone to live
on the Amazon.
-Oh.

14:40.980 --> 14:43.549
Oh, they told me about you!

14:43.616 --> 14:46.118
JO: You must be...
BOTH: Sarah Jane Smith.

14:46.185 --> 14:48.187
Oh, darling!

14:48.254 --> 14:51.023
-After all this time!
-Oh. (CHUCKLES)

14:51.090 --> 14:53.692
Oh, and look at you.

14:53.759 --> 14:55.594
Oh, you're so beautiful!

14:58.664 --> 15:00.466
Sorry. That's my gran.

15:00.532 --> 15:01.600
You'll get used to her.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.869
She looks fantastic. I'm Rani.

15:03.936 --> 15:05.037
Oh.

15:05.104 --> 15:06.438
And I'm Clyde, mate.
You all right?

15:06.505 --> 15:08.440
Yeah. My name's Santiago.

15:08.507 --> 15:10.709
-Wow, good name!
-Yeah, it's where I was born

15:10.776 --> 15:12.911
in a caravan at the foothills
of the Andes.

15:12.978 --> 15:14.346
They should've
called you Andy!

15:14.413 --> 15:15.881
(ALL CHUCKLE)

15:15.948 --> 15:19.385
With respect,
the cradle will continue.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.021
I think he's telling us
to behave.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.856
It's like being
at a school assembly.

15:23.922 --> 15:25.924
Wouldn't know.
Never been to school.

15:25.991 --> 15:27.993
What? How come?

15:28.060 --> 15:29.328
We're always
travelling the world.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.363
-What, are you rich?
-No, just the opposite.

15:31.430 --> 15:33.365
But Mum and Dad,
they got it from Gran.

15:33.432 --> 15:35.768
She's spent her life
going from country to country.

15:35.834 --> 15:37.369
-Doing what?
-Protesting.

15:37.436 --> 15:39.271
Like, um, that G8 summit...

15:39.338 --> 15:41.073
She chained herself
to the railings.

15:41.140 --> 15:42.608
And that
climate change conference...

15:42.675 --> 15:44.843
Dad got arrested. Twice.

15:44.910 --> 15:47.079
Mum's in Japan right now
trying to stop whaling ships.

15:47.146 --> 15:48.981
-Wow! Serious life.
-Yeah.

15:49.048 --> 15:50.516
Well, just to get here today,

15:50.582 --> 15:52.685
we were on
the southern plateau
of the Tierra del Fuego.

15:52.751 --> 15:54.353
So we had to hike
to Buenos Aires,

15:54.420 --> 15:55.821
get a boat to Las Malvinas

15:55.888 --> 15:58.824
and a cargo plane across
the Atlantic.

15:58.891 --> 15:59.858
Where are you guys from?

16:01.627 --> 16:03.996
BOTH: Ealing.

16:04.063 --> 16:07.166
Oh, they used to tell so many
stories about you at UNIT.

16:07.232 --> 16:08.567
Those soldier boys.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.669
Ooh, happy days! (CHUCKLES)

16:10.736 --> 16:13.605
-So, still married?
-Oh, yes.

16:13.672 --> 16:17.042
He's picketing an oil rig
in the Ascension Islands
at the moment.

16:17.109 --> 16:19.812
-And I've got seven children.
-Seven!

16:19.878 --> 16:22.915
And Santiago is one
of 12 grandchildren.

16:22.981 --> 16:25.984
Would you believe,
number 13 on its way?

16:26.919 --> 16:28.787
Oh, how about you, sweetie?

16:28.854 --> 16:31.223
Oh, I've got a son.
He's called Luke,
he's just gone to university.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.858
Oh, no. No dad on the picture.

16:32.925 --> 16:35.361
Ah, playing the field.
Good on you, girl!
(CHUCKLES)

16:35.427 --> 16:37.196
No, not exactly, but...

16:37.262 --> 16:40.199
Oh, it's funny,
all of this today,
'cause it got me thinking.

16:40.265 --> 16:43.435
'Cause the Doctor showed me
such a remarkable life

16:43.502 --> 16:46.105
and when he went,
it just took me a long while
to get over it.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.673
Me too.

16:47.740 --> 16:50.109
You know, sometimes I think
I've never stopped running.

16:50.175 --> 16:52.244
Then he came back,
and I realised

16:52.311 --> 16:55.514
the life I wanted
was right under my nose
all that time.

16:55.914 --> 16:56.849
Who...

16:57.983 --> 16:59.418
Who came back?

17:00.619 --> 17:02.087
The Doctor?

17:02.154 --> 17:04.156
-Yeah.
-Recently?

17:04.223 --> 17:06.558
Oh, about four years ago.

17:08.026 --> 17:09.627
I...

17:09.694 --> 17:11.630
I never saw him again.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.432
Oh, well,
it was just a coincidence.

17:13.499 --> 17:16.201
The first time, we were
both investigating this case.

17:16.268 --> 17:17.301
The first time?

17:17.368 --> 17:19.771
You mean
it was more than once?

17:21.173 --> 17:21.940
Yeah.

17:22.875 --> 17:23.876
Oh.

17:25.411 --> 17:26.645
(SIGHS)

17:26.712 --> 17:28.847
He must have really liked you.

17:31.250 --> 17:35.554
You know, it's funny,
but I have this notion.

17:35.621 --> 17:39.158
That if... If the Doctor
died one day, I mean,

17:39.224 --> 17:42.661
even if he was as far away
as Metebelis Three, that...

17:44.696 --> 17:46.098
Well, that I'd feel it.

17:47.299 --> 17:49.067
You know, in my heart.

17:50.035 --> 17:52.171
That's exactly what I thought.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.440
But I didn't feel a thing.

17:54.506 --> 17:56.074
Nor me.

17:56.141 --> 17:57.142
Not a peep.

17:57.209 --> 17:58.811
Do you think the same as me?

17:58.877 --> 18:01.280
What? Because I think...

18:01.346 --> 18:02.347
BOTH: He's still alive!

18:02.414 --> 18:03.849
Oh. Yes!

18:05.417 --> 18:06.752
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

18:08.754 --> 18:12.524
Right. We need to make a list,
because we need to work out

18:12.591 --> 18:14.393
who'd fake
the Doctor's death, and why.

18:14.460 --> 18:17.429
Ah, and these can help us
to think!

18:17.496 --> 18:19.665
They're scented
with jatamansi oil.

18:19.731 --> 18:22.000
It's a herb from the banks
of the Ganges.

18:22.067 --> 18:23.869
It helps to focus the mind.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.940
We'll just go and get
some tea.

18:28.006 --> 18:30.676
Oh, no, no, no, just hot water
for me, please, sweetheart.

18:30.742 --> 18:32.578
I've got some powdered
lapacho.

18:33.412 --> 18:34.847
You know,

18:34.913 --> 18:37.649
the Doctor took me
to this planet once,
called Peladon,

18:37.716 --> 18:39.518
and the smell of lapacho...

18:39.585 --> 18:42.821
Well, it reminds me of the...
of the Royal Palace.

18:42.888 --> 18:44.323
I went to Peladon!

18:44.389 --> 18:46.291
-You never did!
-With the great beast,
Aggedor?

18:46.358 --> 18:47.593
-Same planet!
-Oh.

18:47.659 --> 18:48.994
(LAUGHING)

18:49.928 --> 18:52.264
Okay. Laters.

18:52.331 --> 18:53.999

<i>Funeral wing now closing.</i>

18:54.066 --> 18:56.268
<i>Repeat, funeral wing</i>
<i>now closing.</i>

18:56.335 --> 18:59.905
It's tragic. He's dead,
but they just can't face it.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.441
I never met the Doctor.
I always wanted to, but...

19:02.508 --> 19:03.742
Too late.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.411
-I wish he was here right now.
-Yeah, me too.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.547
No, I really wish
he was here right now

19:08.614 --> 19:09.848
'cause then he could
explain this.

19:09.915 --> 19:11.583
Clyde, it's happening again!

19:11.650 --> 19:13.519
I know! But I can't say
anything, can I?

19:13.585 --> 19:14.953
Not inside UNIT...

19:15.020 --> 19:16.488
They'd lock me up
and dissect me!

19:16.555 --> 19:20.792
Hold on, what do you mean,
it's happening again?

19:20.859 --> 19:24.730
Well, last time we met
the Doctor, it was
at Sarah Jane's wedding,

19:24.796 --> 19:27.132
and we got stuck
in this time loop thing.

19:29.735 --> 19:31.937
And the TARDIS,
the Doctor's time machine,

19:32.137 --> 19:33.839
it was phasing
in and out of reality.

19:33.906 --> 19:36.875
I touched it, and got zapped
with this stuff.

19:36.942 --> 19:38.844
Artron energy,
the Doctor said.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.279
I think it was part
of the TARDIS.

19:40.345 --> 19:41.880
(SNIGGERS) Whoa!

19:41.947 --> 19:43.649
And you thought my life
was good?

19:43.715 --> 19:45.951
Smelly getting closer!

19:46.018 --> 19:47.352
What do you know
about this stuff?

19:47.419 --> 19:49.021
Closer and closer!

19:49.988 --> 19:51.490
Oi! Come back here, blue boy!

19:57.629 --> 19:59.631
He's like a mouse
in the skirting board!

19:59.698 --> 20:00.699
-You coming?
-Yeah.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.634
No. Honestly, you'll be fine.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.369
We do this kind of thing
all the time.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.371
Hey, my gran once
handcuffed herself
to Robert Mugabe.

20:06.438 --> 20:07.506
I'm loving it!

20:09.141 --> 20:10.008
Oi!

-Clyde!

Keep it down!
This is a top-secret
military base

20:18.350 --> 20:19.718

Oh, and I kind of promised
my dad

20:21.286 --> 20:23.755
I'd be in bed by 10:30 pm.

20:23.822 --> 20:27.125
Brothers of the wing,
I have filleted the cradle

20:27.192 --> 20:29.661
to find the most
powerful memories.

20:29.728 --> 20:32.130
-With what results?
-The women.

20:32.197 --> 20:34.466
The two wise women
of the tribe.

20:34.533 --> 20:38.170
They remember the late Doctor
most strongly of all.

20:38.236 --> 20:40.272
The cradle sings!

20:40.339 --> 20:43.075
Surround them with song!

20:43.141 --> 20:46.111
Tempt them with
days long past!

20:46.178 --> 20:49.181
The memories must grow
if we are to succeed.

to this planet once,

21:11.036 --> 21:13.038
called Karfel,

21:13.105 --> 21:17.676
and they had
a leisure garden,
and the plants could sing.

21:53.879 --> 21:56.381
-What have we stopped for?
-CLYDE: Hush a minute.

21:56.448 --> 21:58.350
Clyde, I'm staring
at your bum.

21:58.417 --> 22:01.086
No, seriously. (SHUSHES)

22:01.153 --> 22:04.823
The women are named Smith,
Sarah Jane,

22:04.890 --> 22:07.359
and Jones, Josephine.

22:07.426 --> 22:10.862
We must drain their minds.

22:10.929 --> 22:13.832
-What of their bodies?
-They will die.

22:13.899 --> 22:17.869
Fortunately, there are
excellent undertakers at hand.

22:18.470 --> 22:19.905
Guys, back up.

22:19.971 --> 22:22.340
We have to get out of here...

22:22.407 --> 22:23.875
No, no, no, no, no!

22:25.510 --> 22:28.080
Back up, back up, back up!

22:28.146 --> 22:29.948
-We are witnessed!
-There's no room
to turn round.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.783
Go backwards! Shuffle!

22:33.785 --> 22:36.021
(ROARS)

22:36.088 --> 22:37.989
Faster! Shuffle for your life!

22:38.056 --> 22:40.192
Fly fast, my brothers!

22:40.258 --> 22:42.527
Stop them! Stop the children!

22:47.866 --> 22:49.735
-Jo? Jo, wake up!
-What?

22:51.169 --> 22:54.639
-Rani? Clyde?
-Where is everyone?

22:54.706 --> 22:56.475
I think
there's something wrong.

22:56.541 --> 22:59.111
Wrong? As in...
You mean just like
the old days sort of wrong?

22:59.177 --> 23:00.545
Oh. Exactly like the old days.

23:00.612 --> 23:03.048
Oh, groovy!

23:03.115 --> 23:04.683
We've got
to get out of here, okay?

23:04.750 --> 23:05.817
Okay.

23:07.052 --> 23:08.787
-There you are!
-Sarah Jane.

23:08.854 --> 23:11.189
It's the Shansheeth.
They're lying
through their beaks.

23:11.256 --> 23:13.158
They want you and Jo.
This whole thing's a trap.

23:13.225 --> 23:14.993
-I knew it!
-Hold on! If they're lying,

23:15.060 --> 23:16.561
that means
the Doctor's still alive!

23:16.628 --> 23:17.929
BOTH: Yes!

23:17.996 --> 23:19.397
THE DOCTOR:
<i>Of course I'm still alive, Jo.</i>

23:19.464 --> 23:20.832
<i>I'd have thought</i>
<i>that was obvious. Catch up!</i>

23:20.899 --> 23:23.001
-What? I beg your pardon?
-Clyde? Is that you?

23:23.068 --> 23:24.636
<i>Course it's not, it's me!</i>

23:24.703 --> 23:26.371
<i>I'm using Clyde as a receiver.</i>

23:26.438 --> 23:28.540
<i>I've keyed into</i>
<i>his residual Artron energy</i>

23:28.607 --> 23:31.943
<i>so I can organize a very</i>
<i>complicated biological swap</i>
<i>across 10,000 light years.</i>

23:32.010 --> 23:33.145
<i>Hold on.</i>

23:33.211 --> 23:34.446
(YELLS)

23:36.848 --> 23:38.683
That wasn't me!

23:38.750 --> 23:40.919
That wasn't me speaking!

23:40.986 --> 23:42.387
I'm getting...

23:45.824 --> 23:47.592
That's not my hand.

23:47.659 --> 23:50.095
'Cause my hand's not white.

23:51.496 --> 23:54.633
-(ELECTRIC BUZZING)
-(SCREAMING)

23:54.699 --> 23:56.768
Sorry, Clyde, but...

23:56.835 --> 23:58.937
-This space...
-No!

23:59.137 --> 24:01.640
...is taken! (GRUNTS)

24:01.706 --> 24:02.574
Good.

24:04.009 --> 24:06.344
So, gosh! That was different.
Hello, everyone!

24:06.411 --> 24:07.445
Who are you?

24:08.814 --> 24:10.782
Where's Clyde?

24:10.849 --> 24:12.651
Oh, come on, Rani,
use your brain!
Clyde and I swapped places.

24:12.717 --> 24:14.319
Yes, I'm where he was,
so he's where I was.

24:14.386 --> 24:15.787
Which means, right now...
Ooh.

24:15.854 --> 24:17.756
He's in a lot of trouble.

24:17.823 --> 24:18.890
Doctor?

24:22.194 --> 24:23.829
Doctor!

24:23.895 --> 24:26.198
You bring him back,
whoever you are!

24:26.264 --> 24:28.033
No, no, no, no, no, Rani,
don't you see?

24:31.369 --> 24:33.271
It's you, isn't it?

24:33.338 --> 24:35.006
Ah, you've done it again.

24:35.073 --> 24:36.708
Hello, Sarah Jane.

24:37.776 --> 24:40.245
-Doctor?
-That's the Doctor?

24:40.312 --> 24:41.913
What Doctor? The Doctor?
My Doctor?

24:41.980 --> 24:43.481
Well, he can change his face.

24:43.548 --> 24:45.383
I know, but into a baby's?

24:45.450 --> 24:46.985
Oi, imagine it
from my point of view.

24:47.052 --> 24:50.155
Last time I saw you, Jo Grant,
you were, what, 21? 22?

24:50.222 --> 24:51.756
It's like someone baked you.

24:51.823 --> 24:54.326
-Oh.
-Hey, everyone! Meanwhile!

24:54.392 --> 24:57.829
Ah, yes, the Claw Shansheeth
of the 15th Funeral Fleet.

24:57.896 --> 24:58.997
I've been looking for you.

25:00.732 --> 25:03.235
Have you been telling people
I'm dead?

25:03.301 --> 25:05.036
I apologise.

25:05.103 --> 25:08.673
The death notice was released
a little too soon.

25:08.740 --> 25:10.876
Though I can rectify this,

25:11.509 --> 25:12.510
immediately!

25:13.879 --> 25:14.846
(GRUNTS)

25:16.648 --> 25:17.883
(DOCTOR GROANS)

25:17.949 --> 25:20.518
I'm so sorry for your loss,
Doctor.

25:21.987 --> 25:24.556
Rest in peace!

25:31.129 --> 25:32.797
Sounds like a countdown.

25:32.864 --> 25:33.865
Run!

25:33.932 --> 25:35.567
Clear this place, seal it off.

25:35.634 --> 25:37.269
Keep that lot trapped.

25:37.335 --> 25:39.271
The memory weave is ready.

25:39.337 --> 25:44.109
Not even the Doctor
will be able to stop
the crusade of the Shansheeth.

25:44.175 --> 25:45.543
Faster, faster, faster!

25:45.610 --> 25:46.645
They're trying to boil us!

25:46.711 --> 25:47.646
We're coming!

25:49.247 --> 25:50.916
That's what
this was all about.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.151
The TARDIS...

25:54.419 --> 25:55.587
And you.

25:55.654 --> 25:57.289
They've stopped.

25:57.355 --> 25:58.723
The key!

25:58.790 --> 26:01.426
-It takes shape...
-JO: <i>Sarah Jane!</i>

26:01.493 --> 26:02.761
Try to think
of something else!

26:02.827 --> 26:04.529
-I can't!
-Neither can I!
