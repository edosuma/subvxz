WEBVTT

00:02.836 --> 00:06.707
Maybe my best dessert ever.

00:07.675 --> 00:10.911
I call it "Mount St. Melons."

00:10.944 --> 00:13.013
See, the chocolate and
the strawberry sauce

00:13.047 --> 00:16.517
is supposed to be the lava
after the big explosion.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.087
I'm pretty sure people died
on Mount St. Helens.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.655
Duh. What do you think the
screaming gummy bears are for?

00:21.689 --> 00:23.357
This is a lot of work, Mom.

00:23.391 --> 00:24.825
You should have saved some
of this for your anniversary.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.327
Oh, yeah. Are you guys
gonna do anything big?

00:26.360 --> 00:28.028
Nah, we're just going
to do what we always do--

00:28.062 --> 00:30.098
give each other
homemade coupons.

00:39.240 --> 00:41.409
(indistinct male voice on TV)

00:47.315 --> 00:48.416
Ooh.

00:55.756 --> 00:56.857
That's it?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.392
But you could
do that any year.

00:58.426 --> 00:59.893
Come on, this is
your twenty-fifth.

00:59.927 --> 01:01.729
Yeah, don't you want to
do something special?

01:01.762 --> 01:03.197
You know
we're not flashy people.

01:03.231 --> 01:04.765
Okay, everybody stand back.

01:04.798 --> 01:08.436
It's time for the humungous
dessert explosion!

01:17.511 --> 01:19.547
(sighing)

01:19.580 --> 01:20.914
Huh.

01:21.849 --> 01:22.750
Must have put
the firecracker

01:22.783 --> 01:23.951
too close
to the gooey lava center.

01:23.984 --> 01:26.254
Well, in that case,
let's dig in.

01:28.122 --> 01:29.990
(laughs)
How is it,
Jimmy?

01:30.023 --> 01:33.227
Good. Thanks for asking.

01:33.261 --> 01:35.129
Whoo!

01:35.163 --> 01:36.597
* Here we go

01:36.630 --> 01:41.101
* Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:44.004 --> 01:46.607
BURT: So, what are we talking
about here?

01:46.640 --> 01:48.776
Six to one?
12 to one?

01:48.809 --> 01:52.079
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.348
Mm-hmm... Mm-hmm!

01:54.382 --> 01:58.986
Well, I wish I was looking
at better odds here.

01:59.019 --> 02:01.021
(quietly):
Okay.

02:01.054 --> 02:02.156
Who are you talking to?

02:02.190 --> 02:03.924
Wrong number.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.427
Plus, I was ordering a pizza
for next week.

02:06.460 --> 02:08.462
You ready for bed?
Me, too.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.997
Yawn!

02:16.170 --> 02:17.805
(snoring)

02:18.906 --> 02:21.209
VIRGINIA:
Jimmy,

02:21.242 --> 02:23.544
we got a problem.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.846
Your father's
gambling again.
What?

02:25.879 --> 02:27.881
He was hiding in the hot tub,

02:27.915 --> 02:30.518
and I heard him talking
on the phone about odds,

02:30.551 --> 02:33.721
and when I asked him about it,
he over-explained.

02:33.754 --> 02:35.223
He gave me the
double excuse.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.624
That doesn't mean he's gambling.

02:36.657 --> 02:38.125
You want to bet?

02:38.158 --> 02:40.194
Every time he's ever given me
the double excuse,

02:40.228 --> 02:41.795
it was to cover up his gambling.

02:41.829 --> 02:43.897
Oh, come on, just stay
within three points.

02:43.931 --> 02:46.234
Just stay within
three points!
Burt,

02:46.267 --> 02:48.402
are you betting on sports again?

02:48.436 --> 02:50.204
No.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.573
The remote just fell
under the coach.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.875
And... I'm trying out Islam.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.745
(chanting indistinctly)

02:57.778 --> 02:59.213
No, not for me.

02:59.247 --> 03:01.515
Too tough on the knees.

03:02.950 --> 03:05.453
(Burt and others
chatting indistinctly)

03:09.089 --> 03:11.158
Burt, are you playing poker?

03:11.191 --> 03:13.661
No. This is a friendly game
of Crazy Eights.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.863
And... we're a book club.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.566
RACE ANNOUNCER:
Mixed Whiskey and Toy...

03:18.599 --> 03:20.334
Run, Silver Charm! Run!

03:20.368 --> 03:22.703
What are you doing?
Nothing.

03:22.736 --> 03:24.071
Why do you have a racing form?

03:24.104 --> 03:26.540
I took this from a kid
on the playground...

03:26.574 --> 03:29.277
to stop him from gambling.

03:29.310 --> 03:31.545
And... I thought
it was a Chinese food menu.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.550
Uh, moo goo gai pain, por favor?

03:37.451 --> 03:39.453
Hey.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.188
Well, if he's gambling again,
we got to confront him.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.090
No. He's just gonna
deny it twice.

03:43.123 --> 03:47.027
We got to find someone really
smart to catch him in the act.

03:47.060 --> 03:49.363
I could set a trap for him
at Howdy's.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.898
Yeah, that's probably better.

03:50.931 --> 03:52.733
We don't have time
to find someone really smart.

04:00.408 --> 04:04.111
Price check on
"He just walked in."

04:04.978 --> 04:06.547
It's a new romance novel.

04:06.580 --> 04:09.182
It's about a guy
who just walked in.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.654
(sighs)

04:13.687 --> 04:15.389
Hey, Burt. Uh,
my lottery guy

04:15.423 --> 04:17.124
accidentally gave me
some extra scratchers.

04:17.157 --> 04:19.593
What do you say
I loan you a nickel,

04:19.627 --> 04:21.228
and we rub off some dreams?

04:21.261 --> 04:23.597
Oh, no, I gave up scratching
the silver squares, Barney.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.567
Come on. I'll do it for you.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.968
Oh, 25 bucks!

04:28.001 --> 04:29.603
(laughs):
Ah, keep the streak

04:29.637 --> 04:31.839
going, baby! Lady Luck's
your bitch right now!

04:31.872 --> 04:33.774
Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's
not call her any names.

04:33.807 --> 04:35.443
I might be facing
some long odds,

04:35.476 --> 04:37.311
and I kind of need Lady
Luck on my side right now.

04:37.345 --> 04:40.481
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just
so keyed up about your success.

04:40.514 --> 04:43.917
Maybe we should, uh, go
to my office and calm me down.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.653
Uh...

04:50.524 --> 04:53.761
Well, what
do we have here?

04:53.794 --> 04:56.930
Who wants to play
a little B-I... G-O?

04:56.964 --> 04:58.098
B-I...

04:58.131 --> 04:59.299
G-O.

04:59.333 --> 05:03.003
Oh, guys,
I'm too tired to... Aah.

05:03.036 --> 05:05.305
I understand
where you're coming from.

05:05.339 --> 05:07.140
I respect that.

05:07.174 --> 05:09.276
I... 21.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.678
Standard rules, boys.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.513
No blackouts.
Got to pay to play.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.848
I really don't
want to play.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.384
Hey, be cool. Be chill.

05:16.417 --> 05:17.885
B... five.

05:17.918 --> 05:19.387
Hey, I got that one!

05:19.420 --> 05:21.288
I knew it. You're
gambling again!

05:21.321 --> 05:23.156
What the hell?
What are you talking about?

05:23.190 --> 05:25.459
They dragged me in here
for a game of bingo.

05:25.493 --> 05:26.794
It's a gateway game.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.396
Admit it. You have a problem.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.164
Fine. I admit it.
I do have a problem.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.534
I have a lump on my testicle.

05:34.868 --> 05:36.036
Oh...

05:36.069 --> 05:37.204
Oh-ho...

05:37.237 --> 05:39.239
72.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.441
O, 72.

05:44.512 --> 05:47.381
Why didn't you call
the doctor right away?

05:47.415 --> 05:50.350
I did call...
Dr. Tim's radio show.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.653
Dr. Tim is a love
and relationship doctor.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.254
Well, I don't know about you,

05:54.287 --> 05:56.657
but I have a very loving
relationship with my testicles.

05:56.690 --> 05:57.758
But...

05:57.791 --> 05:59.159
your mother found me

05:59.192 --> 06:00.093
before Dr. Tim could
tell me what to do.

06:00.127 --> 06:01.094
I'm sure it's nothing.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.329
I found a lump once.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.564
Turned out to be
no big deal.

06:03.597 --> 06:04.665
Do you remember
what it felt like?

06:04.698 --> 06:05.733
I'll never forget.

06:05.766 --> 06:06.834
What do I need
a doctor for?

06:06.867 --> 06:08.536
I got Barney.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.538
You're an expert.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.406
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Burt, I'm not a doctor.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.674
It doesn't matter.

06:13.707 --> 06:14.675
You remember
what yours felt like.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.876
If mine feels the same,

06:15.909 --> 06:17.511
I know I got nothing
to worry about.

06:17.545 --> 06:20.548
I'm not qualified... and
you're definitely not Jewish.

06:20.581 --> 06:23.350
You're a grocer whose hands are
trained to handle ripe fruit.

06:23.383 --> 06:25.453
Come on, Barney. I'm desperate.

06:25.486 --> 06:27.387
Okay. Um...

06:27.421 --> 06:28.922
let me find some plastic gloves.

06:28.956 --> 06:31.091
Did you use gloves
when you felt yours?

06:31.124 --> 06:33.961
No, I did not.
Well, then you
shouldn't use 'em with Burt.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.362
It should be the same feeling.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.397
Thank you for that, Frank.

06:37.431 --> 06:40.734
Okay, um, uh, which one is it?

06:40.768 --> 06:42.570
Uh, Starsky.
And which one's Starsky?

06:42.603 --> 06:44.538
Obviously,
one on the driver's side.

06:44.572 --> 06:45.939
For accuracy's sake,
you're probably gonna want

06:45.973 --> 06:47.941
to be in the same position
you were in

06:47.975 --> 06:49.109
when you felt your lump.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.611
Why are you two here?

06:50.644 --> 06:52.045
Because if we weren't,

06:52.079 --> 06:53.814
you two would be doing
this totally wrong.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.517
I think they're right, Barney.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.587
Okay, um, let's...

07:00.788 --> 07:02.289
(whistling)

07:02.322 --> 07:04.558
Oh, this is definitely
bigger than mine.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.059
No, don't-don't
worry about that.

07:06.093 --> 07:07.394
I am taller than you...

07:07.427 --> 07:10.464
No, the lump is
slightly larger than mine

07:10.498 --> 07:11.932
and... rounder.

07:11.965 --> 07:14.201
Mine was oblong.
Yeah.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.771
Now, texture-wise...
Oh!

07:17.805 --> 07:18.972
Ooh, don't press it like that!

07:19.006 --> 07:20.240
You might dislodge it.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.842
Then we'll never find it
in my body.

07:21.875 --> 07:23.811
Burt, I don't think
that's the way the body works.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.479
What do you know?
You're just a grocer.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.481
Well, I wish
you would have had that attitude

07:27.515 --> 07:29.316
before you asked me
to fondle your giblets.

07:29.349 --> 07:31.418
Dad, you're going
to the doctor.

07:31.451 --> 07:36.189
Fine. I hate those guys,
but it's the right thing to do.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.025
Just don't tell your mother
about any of this.

07:38.058 --> 07:39.493
I don't want
to ruin our anniversary.

07:39.527 --> 07:41.294
While you're doing this, Barney,

07:41.328 --> 07:42.863
you ever get any hemorrhoids?

07:42.896 --> 07:44.297
(unzipping)

07:45.666 --> 07:47.701
When you said
homemade coupons,

07:47.735 --> 07:50.103
I didn't expect them to be
so elaborate and beautiful.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.438
Let me see.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.674
"Good for one toenail clipping."

07:53.707 --> 07:55.876
Bet you never saw that
written in calligraphy before.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.178
Shouldn't these be
for something romantic,

07:58.211 --> 08:00.781
like sex or back rubs?

08:00.814 --> 08:04.151
Coupons for sex?
What am I, a whore?

08:05.653 --> 08:07.655
(both laughing loudly)

08:09.489 --> 08:11.191
Good. You're back.

08:11.224 --> 08:12.392
How'd it go?

08:12.425 --> 08:15.228
Great. He's not gambling.

08:15.262 --> 08:16.530
Well, if he's not gambling,

08:16.564 --> 08:17.898
then what
took so long?

08:17.931 --> 08:19.867
Freak sandstorm.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.469
Plus, a family of ducks
were crossing the road.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.804
SABRINA:
What...?

08:23.837 --> 08:24.905
Mm-hmm.

08:24.938 --> 08:26.339
Either one of those

08:26.373 --> 08:28.576
excuses alone would have
been perfectly good.

08:28.609 --> 08:29.910
Mm-hmm.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.345
But together,
I smell something fishy.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.582
Oh, yeah. When Jimmy
uses a double excuse,

08:34.615 --> 08:36.550
it means he's lying
about something.

08:36.584 --> 08:38.819
I'm gonna find out
what's going on.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.387
Good. You two are married now.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.022
Lying and being deceitful

08:42.055 --> 08:44.625
to get information out of him
is your job, not mine.

08:46.694 --> 08:50.030
So, uh, you made that
appointment for the doctor yet?

08:50.063 --> 08:51.431
Oh, yeah, I called, but, uh,

08:51.464 --> 08:53.734
he's all booked up
for the next couple of weeks.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.368
And he's on vacation
in Bermuda.

08:55.402 --> 08:57.237
Interesting, because
I made you an appointment

08:57.270 --> 08:58.772
for Friday afternoon.

08:58.806 --> 09:00.841
You had no right
to make an appointment for me.

09:00.874 --> 09:02.342
Obviously, I had to.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.778
And why are you so afraid
of the doctor anyway?

09:04.812 --> 09:07.881
'Cause doctors always
give you bad news.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.117
Promise you'll go to
the doctor on Friday.

09:10.150 --> 09:13.253
Okay, fine...
I'll go.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.724
(loud buzzing,
indistinct shouting)

09:21.461 --> 09:23.931
Hey.

09:25.933 --> 09:27.534
What'd you hear?

09:27.567 --> 09:30.070
Okay, so, it was a little hard
to hear over all the noise,

09:30.103 --> 09:32.640
but I was able
to make out a few words.

09:32.673 --> 09:35.242
Anniversary, jewels,

09:35.275 --> 09:37.778
and something
about a dangling pair.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.312
Oh, my God.

09:39.346 --> 09:41.615
I'm getting diamond earrings
for my anniversary!

09:41.649 --> 09:44.351
(both screaming)

09:47.788 --> 09:49.322
(both screaming)

09:49.356 --> 09:52.559
You're getting earrings!
They're diamond earrings!

09:52.592 --> 09:55.495
(both laugh)

09:55.528 --> 09:58.231
I bet you they're not
just earrings, either.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.067
I bet they're nanny earrings.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.902
Nanny earrings? What nanny?

10:01.935 --> 10:05.105
America's nanny:
Fran Dress-cher?

10:05.138 --> 10:06.606
Burt must have
heard me saying

10:06.640 --> 10:08.508
how much I loved the
diamond-style earrings

10:08.541 --> 10:10.610
she was selling on the
TV shopping channel.

10:10.644 --> 10:12.112
Experts do actually say

10:12.145 --> 10:14.014
that even though diamonds
may lose their value,

10:14.047 --> 10:16.583
that diamond-style earrings
stay exactly the same

10:16.616 --> 10:18.786
for all of eternity.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.521
Man, Burt has really
upped the ante on this one.

10:21.554 --> 10:23.824
How am I supposed
to give him a coupon

10:23.857 --> 10:26.459
to clip his toenails after
he's just given me jewelry

10:26.493 --> 10:28.696
created by the world's
top diamond scientists.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.598
Well, what is something
that Burt has always wanted?

10:31.631 --> 10:34.167
To be on Circus
of the Stars.
Is that show
still on?

10:34.201 --> 10:35.936
No. Now, if you
want to see stars,

10:35.969 --> 10:37.437
you have to watch
'em dance, dive

10:37.470 --> 10:39.106
or go to rehab
with Dr. Drew.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.008
You know what?

10:41.041 --> 10:43.643
I think I have
a better idea.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.649
Frank, call the number!

10:49.683 --> 10:51.885
You really want
to keep playing?

10:51.919 --> 10:54.154
Yes.
I'm used to hearing this

10:54.187 --> 10:55.655
more than saying it,

10:55.689 --> 10:58.158
but this is getting
very uncomfortable for me.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.793
You may have won all my money,

10:59.827 --> 11:01.995
my grandmother's lucky keychain
and my burial plot,

11:02.029 --> 11:03.530
but my luck is about to change.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.665
Call the ball!

11:09.402 --> 11:10.670
I-18.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.172
Bingo.

11:12.205 --> 11:14.341
No! Impossible.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.576
One more game.

11:16.609 --> 11:19.046
You haven't got
anything left that I want.

11:20.881 --> 11:23.016
I bet there's one thing.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.654
I'm the new manager!

11:27.687 --> 11:30.523
Everyone's gonna get laid!

11:30.557 --> 11:32.525
(Frank laughs)

11:32.559 --> 11:34.361
I mean, sale on eggs.

11:38.065 --> 11:40.233
Whew, I got to say, Virginia...

11:40.267 --> 11:43.670
a long, bumpy blindfolded
drive around town?

11:43.703 --> 11:46.840
You really nailed
this anniversary gift.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.341
But I'm glad we're home.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.877
No, Burt.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.411
We are at...

11:51.444 --> 11:53.246
a dude ranch!

11:53.280 --> 11:55.182
Happy anniversary!

11:55.215 --> 11:57.450
Now you get
to finally be a cowboy.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.887
W... wow.

11:59.920 --> 12:01.121
Thanks, honey.

12:01.154 --> 12:02.522
(gunshots, Western music plays)

12:02.555 --> 12:04.124
MAN (on recording):
Cowboys and cowgirls,

12:04.157 --> 12:05.759
welcome to the Bar None Ranch

12:05.793 --> 12:08.061
and simulated
Western experience.

12:08.095 --> 12:09.596
Now here's your wagon master,

12:09.629 --> 12:12.699
the fastest gun north
of the Mississippi:

12:12.732 --> 12:13.934
Colt Palomino.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.168
(gunshot on recording)

12:15.969 --> 12:18.071
(gunshots on recording)

12:19.339 --> 12:21.474
(whinnying)
Whoa.

12:21.508 --> 12:23.944
(gunshots on recording)

12:23.977 --> 12:25.545
Howdy.

12:25.578 --> 12:27.380
Welcome to the Bar None.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.883
I'm Colt Palomino.

12:29.917 --> 12:31.384
Let's get you
city slickers

12:31.418 --> 12:33.153
into some authentic
Western wear

12:33.186 --> 12:35.622
so you can have a real
frontier experience,

12:35.655 --> 12:36.756
right after...

12:36.790 --> 12:38.325
you sign these...

12:38.358 --> 12:40.293
rootin' tootin'
disclaimer forms.

12:40.327 --> 12:42.029
There, there, and there.

12:44.664 --> 12:45.732
Yee-haw!

12:45.765 --> 12:46.967
Oops, uh...
initial there.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.602
Yee-haw!

12:49.636 --> 12:52.405
Let's do some dangerous crap.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.606
(chuckles)

12:58.979 --> 12:59.980
Sabrina!

13:00.013 --> 13:01.248
Huh?
Uh, can you
cover me

13:01.281 --> 13:02.515
for about an hour?

13:02.549 --> 13:04.417
I got to go do
something with my dad.

13:04.451 --> 13:05.785
Where are you
going, anyway?

13:05.819 --> 13:07.087
Ice-skating.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.989
And giving
myself a haircut.
Really?

13:09.022 --> 13:10.557
Don't double
excuse me.

13:11.224 --> 13:12.459
What's going on?

13:12.492 --> 13:13.526
My dad doesn't want
my mom to worry

13:13.560 --> 13:14.594
on their anniversary,

13:14.627 --> 13:16.429
but he found a lump

13:16.463 --> 13:17.931
on one of his
family jewels

13:17.965 --> 13:19.266
and he's supposed
to go to the doctor

13:19.299 --> 13:20.300
this afternoon.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.102
He's not going.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.636
Your mom took him
to some dude ranch.

13:23.670 --> 13:24.704
I got to go pick him up!

13:24.737 --> 13:26.273
No! You can't just
leave me here.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.175
Frank's gone crazy
with power.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.810
Wheel me to my condiment aisle.

13:30.844 --> 13:34.447
I need to see if my mustards
will pass muster.

13:34.481 --> 13:35.916
As you wish.

13:38.485 --> 13:40.653
JIMMY:
While Mom was hoping to have
the time of their lives,

13:40.687 --> 13:42.189
Dad's ball lump had him hoping

13:42.222 --> 13:44.491
there was still time
left in his life.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.658
Perfect.

13:47.060 --> 13:49.496
Okay... one, two, three:

13:49.529 --> 13:50.397
pork and beans.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.832
BOTH:
Pork and beans!

13:54.501 --> 13:56.836
Here's your souvenir photo.

13:57.837 --> 13:59.139
Here.
Oh, an instant photo.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.974
Oh, this is like getting
in a time machine

14:01.008 --> 14:02.475
and going all the way
back to 1983.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.576
Well, thanks
for everything.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.912
We'll tell our friends.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.379
Whoa, there, partner.
What's your hurry?

14:06.413 --> 14:07.814
You got a rattlesnake
in your boot?

14:07.847 --> 14:09.582
We got a whole lot more
cowboying to do.

14:09.616 --> 14:11.218
Yeah.
It's our anniversary,

14:11.251 --> 14:13.386
so I got us the Big
Buckaroo package.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.654
That's right.
A full day

14:14.687 --> 14:16.223
of ranch-workin', cow-pokin',

14:16.256 --> 14:18.391
hat-wearin', spur-janglin'
cowboy work,

14:18.425 --> 14:20.894
culminating with you birthing

14:20.928 --> 14:24.197
a realistic-lookin' calf
from a real cow.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.766
A full day, huh?

14:26.799 --> 14:28.168
All right,
What's next?

14:28.201 --> 14:30.003
First thing you got to learn

14:30.037 --> 14:31.838
before you go out on the range

14:31.871 --> 14:33.506
is how to handle...

14:33.540 --> 14:34.707
Holy hell!

14:35.909 --> 14:37.177
Where'd you learn
to shoot like that?

14:37.210 --> 14:38.912
Blasting weeds,
mi amigo.

14:38.946 --> 14:41.048
What's next?

14:47.054 --> 14:49.356
(playing tune)

14:49.389 --> 14:50.890
Okay, what's next?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.527
Whoo-hoo, I did it!

14:54.561 --> 14:56.363
98th time's a charm, huh?

14:56.396 --> 14:57.364
What an anniversary.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.231
Thank you,
Virginia.

14:58.265 --> 14:59.399
Thank you, Colt.

14:59.432 --> 15:00.934
Yippie-ki-yay.
Uh, happy trails.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.769
Hi-ho, Silver!
Bonjour.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.104
Hold your horses,
partner.

15:04.137 --> 15:05.738
The day ain't over.
Yeah, Burt.

15:05.772 --> 15:07.040
What's your hurry?

15:07.074 --> 15:08.075
We still haven't
done the best part...

15:08.108 --> 15:09.876
the trail ride.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.744
Yeah, you finished
the chores so quickly,

15:11.778 --> 15:14.247
we got an extra hour to ride all
the way to Ball Buster Canyon.

15:14.281 --> 15:15.382
Ooh...

15:15.415 --> 15:17.817
Name sounds nicer in Navajo.

15:17.850 --> 15:19.286
I would love to do
that with you, Colt,

15:19.319 --> 15:21.054
but we really got to leave.
Hey, Burt,

15:21.088 --> 15:22.555
what is going on?

15:22.589 --> 15:24.391
I planned
this whole day

15:24.424 --> 15:25.925
for our anniversary

15:25.959 --> 15:27.995
and it seems like
you're not into it at all.

15:28.028 --> 15:29.396
Where else do
we need to be?

15:29.429 --> 15:30.998
Well, I left a popsicle out.

15:31.031 --> 15:32.832
I forgot to set the VCR
to record Columbo.

15:32.865 --> 15:36.003
Stop it. You've been
in a hurry all day

15:36.036 --> 15:39.172
and we're here in the most
romantic spot on Earth:

15:39.206 --> 15:40.907
the Bar None Dude Ranch.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.575
Much obliged, little lady.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.745
I hope you'll share that review
on duderanchfinder.com.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.347
Virginia, I can't explain why.

15:47.380 --> 15:48.615
You just have to trust me.

15:48.648 --> 15:49.616
We got to leave right now.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.284
Okay.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.121
Nobody's going anywhere.

15:57.824 --> 15:59.826
Aw, balls!

16:04.364 --> 16:05.932
(horse whinnies)

16:05.965 --> 16:07.300
You stabbed our truck!

16:07.334 --> 16:08.801
Yeah...

16:08.835 --> 16:10.537
because I've been working
real hard on the finale.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.272
I poured my heart
into the campfire song

16:12.305 --> 16:14.007
and no one ever stays
to listen to it.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.342
Can you imagine anything worse?

16:15.375 --> 16:16.443
Yeah, I can.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.278
I got a lump in my testicle.

16:18.311 --> 16:20.113
Touché.
What?!

16:20.147 --> 16:22.849
Starsky
or Hutch?
I'm afraid
it's Starsky.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.951
Oh, my God,
he's my favorite.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.020
Yeah.
Are you gonna
be all right?

16:27.054 --> 16:28.155
You should really see a doctor.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.289
Well, I was trying to.

16:29.322 --> 16:30.723
Then you stabbed
our truck!

16:30.757 --> 16:32.359
I got a doctor's
appointment in
20 minutes.

16:32.392 --> 16:33.460
I didn't want
to worry you

16:33.493 --> 16:34.494
or ruin our
anniversary.

16:34.527 --> 16:35.562
Well, let's just
call Jimmy

16:35.595 --> 16:36.896
and have him
pick us up.

16:36.929 --> 16:38.498
Well, there's no
cell reception up here.

16:38.531 --> 16:40.233
That's why we call it
the Bar None.

16:40.267 --> 16:41.668
But don't you
fret, ma'am.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.002
We'll ride you into town

16:43.036 --> 16:44.237
and we'll make
that doctor's appointment

16:44.271 --> 16:45.805
with time to spare.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.840
I am not getting on a horse
named Wrecking Ball.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.076
There's always Nut Cracker,

16:49.109 --> 16:50.210
but she's a little feisty.

16:50.243 --> 16:51.144
(whimpers)

16:51.178 --> 16:52.512
Don't worry, Burt.

16:52.545 --> 16:53.813
We'll get you there.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.416
Hang on there, honey!

16:56.449 --> 16:59.086
Now I know why they call it
dead-man style.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.487
'Cause you wish you were dead.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.255
I had to ride that way
for an entire day

17:02.289 --> 17:03.723
on an episode of Bonanza.

17:03.756 --> 17:04.524
You're an actor?

17:04.557 --> 17:05.925
Yes, ma'am.

17:05.958 --> 17:07.060
Started when I was nine,

17:07.094 --> 17:08.861
on an episode of Bonanza.

17:08.895 --> 17:10.363
What else were you in?

17:10.397 --> 17:12.665
Did I mention I was on
an episode of Bonanza?

17:12.699 --> 17:14.000
I was nine.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.536
Been a bit of a dry
spell since then.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.538
But I just got new headshots.

17:18.571 --> 17:19.572
(groans)

17:19.606 --> 17:22.575
FRANK:
Give it up, Barney.

17:22.609 --> 17:24.177
I already won
everything you own.

17:24.211 --> 17:25.278
Not everything.

17:25.312 --> 17:27.013
You don't have my soul.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.548
Hmm.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.085
I've always wanted
to have two souls.

17:32.119 --> 17:34.154
Okay, you're on.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.390
Aha!

17:37.424 --> 17:38.225
I knew it!

17:38.258 --> 17:39.926
Oh, all right, fine.

17:39.959 --> 17:41.928
I'm wearing
a magnetized bracelet.

17:41.961 --> 17:43.930
But I did
this for you.

17:43.963 --> 17:45.265
What?!

17:45.298 --> 17:47.100
I know you've got
a gambling problem.

17:47.134 --> 17:49.769
I figured if I kept
you from winning,

17:49.802 --> 17:50.870
you wouldn't
start again.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.205
The only thing is,

17:52.239 --> 17:54.907
turns out I've got
a cheating problem.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.443
(chuckles) I love it.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.811
Ow!

17:58.845 --> 18:01.914
Burt, you were smart
not to ride this way.

18:01.948 --> 18:04.751
I don't even have testicles
and this is no picnic.

18:04.784 --> 18:06.085
Neither is this.

18:06.119 --> 18:08.588
Did you know horses poop
while they walk?

18:08.621 --> 18:09.922
Oh...

18:09.956 --> 18:10.923
We got company.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.292
Aw, don't worry.

18:12.325 --> 18:13.926
The Indians around
here are friendly.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.729
Mr. Patel,

18:16.763 --> 18:18.231
thanks for the vindaloo.

18:18.265 --> 18:20.500
It's hard to get those
cumin levels just right,

18:20.533 --> 18:22.569
but you nailed it.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.770
Swadisht.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.706
(Burt grunting in pain)

18:27.940 --> 18:29.642
COLT:
Ah, told you I'd get you here.

18:29.676 --> 18:30.677
Okay, we're just in time
for the appointment.

18:30.710 --> 18:32.179
Let's get inside.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.281
You know what, I don't
think I need to go in.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.848
The horse fixed my lump.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.650
And I just made the whole
thing up to get attention.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.118
No more double excuses

18:39.152 --> 18:40.287
and no chickening out.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.355
Come on,
let's get inside.

18:42.389 --> 18:44.090
Colt Palomino saves the day.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.358
You take your time.

18:45.392 --> 18:46.926
I'm going to mosey
across the street

18:46.959 --> 18:48.528
and get some water
for the horses

18:48.561 --> 18:50.663
and a double soy
half-caf macchiato

18:50.697 --> 18:52.299
with a touch of cinnamon for me.

18:52.332 --> 18:53.466
Come on, boys.

18:55.902 --> 18:57.136
This has to
be the place.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.805
It's kind of
giving me the creeps.

18:58.838 --> 18:59.806
Me, too.

18:59.839 --> 19:00.973
Doesn't even
seem like

19:01.007 --> 19:02.275
anybody's here.

19:02.309 --> 19:04.010
Hello?

19:04.043 --> 19:05.612
(recorded gunshots,
music playing)
(screams)

19:05.645 --> 19:07.347
COLT:
Cowboys and cowgirls...
(gunshot)

19:07.380 --> 19:08.648
...welcome to
the Bar None Ranch...

19:08.681 --> 19:10.049
What the hell is this place?

19:10.082 --> 19:12.452
Now here's your wagon master...
Jimmy...

19:12.485 --> 19:14.153
They murdered
your parents' tire.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.555
...north of the Mississippi:
We gotta get
out of here.

19:15.588 --> 19:17.224
Colt Palomino!
Come on!

19:17.257 --> 19:19.959
JIMMY: While we thought
we were about to die,

19:19.992 --> 19:22.295
my parents found out
that Starsky's lump

19:22.329 --> 19:24.063
was just a fatty deposit.

19:24.096 --> 19:26.233
To celebrate that Dad's
Big Buckaroo package was fine,

19:26.266 --> 19:29.569
they let Colt put
the finishing touches on his.

19:29.602 --> 19:31.904
* Some day

19:31.938 --> 19:34.474
* When I'm a TV cowboy

19:34.507 --> 19:37.176
* In the Hollywood Hills

19:37.210 --> 19:39.979
* I'll sleep under
the star...lets *

19:40.012 --> 19:41.714
* And take lots of pills

19:41.748 --> 19:45.652
* I'll wear alligator boots
and designer jeans *

19:45.685 --> 19:48.555
* Lasso through the roof
of my limousine *

19:48.588 --> 19:52.592
* I'll be the grandest cowboy
on the silver screen *

19:52.625 --> 19:54.694
* Yippie-ki-yo-ki-yay

19:54.727 --> 19:56.596
(yodeling quietly)

19:56.629 --> 19:58.164
I'm glad
Starsky's okay.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.233
I wonder how he got
that fatty deposit.

20:00.267 --> 20:02.502
I blame Hutch,
he's always been jealous.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.337
I wish you would've
told me sooner.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.339
I hope I didn't ruin
our anniversary.

20:06.373 --> 20:07.940
Of course not.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.342
Just knowing
you're okay,

20:09.376 --> 20:11.378
that's the greatest
gift I could get.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.681
* I'll find a special lady

20:14.714 --> 20:17.216
* And at night we'll ride

20:17.250 --> 20:19.719
* The only gun shootin' blanks

20:19.752 --> 20:22.455
* Will be at my side

20:22.489 --> 20:25.958
* Well, she'll be my Dale
and I'll be her Roy *

20:25.992 --> 20:28.528
* We'll ride together on
the trail to eternal joy *

20:28.561 --> 20:30.029
* 'Cause you have sex
with a partner *

20:30.062 --> 20:32.031
* When you're a TV cowboy

20:32.064 --> 20:34.634
* Yippie-ki-yo-ki-yay...

20:35.835 --> 20:37.770
(whistles)
HOPE:
Yee-haw!

20:37.804 --> 20:39.071
(Hope giggles)

20:44.577 --> 20:46.078
Thank you.

20:47.113 --> 20:49.449
A cowhand told me
you wanted this.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.617
I thought Sabrina told you.

20:50.650 --> 20:53.085
It's cowboy-speak.
Oh, right.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.087
Howdy, pilgrim.

20:55.121 --> 20:56.423
I like beans.

20:56.456 --> 20:57.790
(stops playing)

20:58.625 --> 21:00.560
(coyote howling)

21:00.593 --> 21:01.661
Yeah.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.463
(gasps) Oh, my God!
Mm-hmm.

21:03.496 --> 21:06.833
It's the Fran
Dress-cher earrings.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.768
The way the fire
reflects off them,

21:08.801 --> 21:11.338
they almost look
like real diamonds.

21:11.371 --> 21:12.939
Happy anniversary.

21:12.972 --> 21:15.074
Happy anniversary.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.277
* Well, she'll be my Dale
and I'll be her Roy *

21:18.311 --> 21:19.812
* We'll ride together
on the trail *

21:19.846 --> 21:21.013
* To eternal joy

21:21.047 --> 21:22.281
* 'Cause you're never lonely

21:22.315 --> 21:24.817
* When you're a TV cowboy

21:24.851 --> 21:27.754
* Yippie-ki-yo-ki-yay

21:27.787 --> 21:31.190
* Yippie-ki-yippie-ki-
yippie-ki-yo-ki-yay. *

21:31.223 --> 21:33.360
(horse snorts)

21:35.227 --> 21:36.629
(boat horn honks)

21:36.663 --> 21:38.598
MAN:
Jim-Jim, Jim-Jim, Jim.
