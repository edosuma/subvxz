MORE OF THAT ROLE PLAYING?

02:21.509 --> 02:23.411

MY MISGIVINGS ABOUT THIS...

IN YOUR TREATMENT.

02:31.585 --> 02:34.322
BUT, TARA, YOU SEEM VERY CLEAR
THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.257
>> MM-HMM. YEAH.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.491
IT IS.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.527
>> OKAY.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.395
I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO FACILITATE IT

02:41.429 --> 02:42.496
AND TO KEEP YOU SAFE.

02:42.530 --> 02:46.234
>> THANKS.

02:46.267 --> 02:48.536
I THINK I'M OKAY.
I ACTUALLY FEEL KIND OF CALM.

02:48.569 --> 02:51.805
I'M NOT EXPECTING ANY KIND
OF APOLOGY OR ANYTHING.

02:51.839 --> 02:53.541
>> [clears throat]

02:53.574 --> 02:55.543

SOME OF THAT

02:55.576 --> 03:00.248
FILTHY CAFETERIA STROGANOFF
DOWN THIS GUY'S FREAKIN' THROAT?

03:00.281 --> 03:01.915
ALL RIGHT.
PROBABLY NOT BEING HELPFUL.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.551
>> NO, IT'S OKAY.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.453
YOU HAVE EVERY REASON
TO WANNA FACE TRIP, MAX.

03:05.486 --> 03:06.887
BUT REMEMBER,

03:06.920 --> 03:08.589
JUST BECAUSE HE'S OPEN
TO A MEETING AND TALKING

03:08.622 --> 03:10.358
DOESN'T MEAN
THAT HIS FEELINGS WON'T CHANGE

03:10.391 --> 03:12.826
ONCE WE GET INTO THE ROOM.

03:12.860 --> 03:14.628
AND YOURS, TOO, TARA.

03:14.662 --> 03:16.864
>> I KNOW.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.700
I'M NOT LOOKING FOR A MIRACLE.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.502
AND I HEARD YOU YESTERDAY
WHEN YOU SAID

03:21.535 --> 03:23.771
EVEN IF IT GOES WELL,
IT MIGHT BE DISAPPOINTING.

03:23.804 --> 03:27.575
BUT I JUST...

03:27.608 --> 03:30.678
I WANNA GET BETTER.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.546
NOT KNOWING HAS GOTTA BE WORSE

03:32.580 --> 03:34.315
THAN ANYTHING THAT CAN
HAPPEN IN THAT ROOM.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.583
RIGHT?

03:35.616 --> 03:38.486
>> YEAH, RIGHT.

03:38.519 --> 03:42.523
>> SO...

03:42.556 --> 03:44.258

SO EVERYTHING TASTES SWEET.
>> FABULOUS.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.677
WELL, KEEP IT DOWN, OKAY?

04:03.711 --> 04:05.413
I'M CALLING YOUR MOM
AT THE HOSPITAL.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.881
>> HOW IS SHE?

04:07.915 --> 04:10.818
>> IT'S PRETTY INTENSE.
THERE'S A LOT GOIN' ON.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.653
ANY MESSAGES?

04:12.686 --> 04:14.655
>> YEAH, TELL HER I SAY HI.

04:14.688 --> 04:17.858
>> NOPE.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.462
>> YOU OKAY?
>> YEAH.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.797

GONNA TALK TO MOM?

04:23.831 --> 04:25.866
>> AND SAY WHAT?

04:25.899 --> 04:28.936
>> DUDE, YOU NEED TO FIGURE
THAT STUFF OUT.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.605
ANYWAY, I GOTTA GO.

04:31.639 --> 04:32.940
I HAVE A MEETING

04:32.973 --> 04:34.575
AT THE BARNABEEZ HEADQUARTERS
TOMORROW.

04:34.608 --> 04:35.609
HOPEFULLY, THEY WRITE ME
A BIG, FAT CHECK

04:35.643 --> 04:36.944
SO I CAN GET A VESPA.

04:36.977 --> 04:39.313
>> I GOTTA MAKE THIS CALL.
>> GOOD NIGHT.

04:39.347 --> 04:42.716

05:43.176 --> 05:45.846
>> STILL SMELLS LIKE
A PICKLE, BUT...

05:45.879 --> 05:49.116
>> IT DOESN'T TASTE
LIKE A PICKLE...I SWEAR.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.685
>> STILL DOES NOT TASTE GOOD.

05:57.825 --> 06:00.160

BUT I-I ALREADY TOLD YOU
THAT GENE...

06:13.507 --> 06:16.577

YOU WERE VERY QUIET.

16:56.283 --> 17:00.453
DIDN'T REALLY PARTY
WITH THE GROUP.

17:00.487 --> 17:03.756

WASN'T WHAT MADE TARA SPLIT.

20:53.486 --> 20:56.356
>> YOU'RE CUTE.
I WISH YOU WERE A GYNO.

20:56.389 --> 20:58.558
>> SHUT UP, T.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.926
>> THIS ISN'T UNCOMMON.

20:59.959 --> 21:02.629
THE IDEA THAT
THE BOARDING SCHOOL INCIDENT

21:02.662 --> 21:04.797
WAS ACTUALLY
A RE-TRAUMATIZATION

21:04.831 --> 21:06.499
MAKES GOOD SENSE, MAX.

21:06.533 --> 21:11.504
>> SHE'S HOT.

21:11.538 --> 21:13.840

21:21.681 --> 21:23.450
I MUST APOLOGIZE FOR HER.

21:23.483 --> 21:27.053
WHAT YOU MUST THINK OF US.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.822
T'S TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING,
BUT SHE CAN'T COME BACK OUT.

21:29.856 --> 21:32.058
N--NO, T.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.626
NO, YOU CAN'T.

21:33.660 --> 21:36.496
AND TARA--WELL...

21:36.529 --> 21:39.432
I DON'T KNOW WHERE
TARA'S GONE OFF TO.

21:39.466 --> 21:42.702
>> SO TARA'S NOT INSIDE
LISTENING.

21:42.735 --> 21:45.338
>> I DON'T KNOW WHERE
TARA'S GONE OFF TO.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.839
JUST AS WELL.

21:46.873 --> 21:49.442

21:57.817 --> 21:59.419
>> I THINK THERE IS,

21:59.452 --> 22:01.020
AND SHE'S STRONGER
THAN YOU THINK, ALICE.

22:01.053 --> 22:05.558
>> NO, SHE ISN'T.
SHE'S WEAK, AND SHE NEEDS ME.

22:05.592 --> 22:09.462
THAT YOU WOULD SUGGEST...

22:09.496 --> 22:12.532
THAT YOU WOULD DARE TO SUGGEST

22:12.565 --> 22:17.704
THAT YOU KNOW HER
BETTER THAN I DO.

22:17.737 --> 22:20.373
JUST...
