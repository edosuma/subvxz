00:02.171 --> 00:05.436
Touch that remote
and I'll use you for a scratching post.

00:06.409 --> 00:07.842
You threatening me, cat?

00:08.010 --> 00:10.410
Sounds like it, Kinkle.

00:18.721 --> 00:20.382
Sweet victory.

00:20.556 --> 00:23.491
No one.
No one is taking this away from me.

00:23.659 --> 00:24.683
Thanks, Harvey.

00:24.860 --> 00:26.794
<i>Hurry up.
It's time for National Superstars.</i>

00:26.962 --> 00:30.056
<i>Coming through.
National Superstars is about to start.</i>

00:30.232 --> 00:32.097
Did I miss anything?

00:35.604 --> 00:37.765
Does it matter
that I was just watching TV?

00:37.940 --> 00:39.635
<i>Were you gonna watch
National Superstars?</i>

00:39.809 --> 00:41.208
- No.
- Then it doesn't matter.

00:41.377 --> 00:43.538
This is the finale.
Clay's gonna sing against Tanya.

00:43.712 --> 00:47.978
Oh, I wouldn't mind making
a little dreidel out of Clay.

00:48.150 --> 00:50.084
I just love watching
someone's dreams coming true

00:50.252 --> 00:51.276
right before our eyes.

00:51.454 --> 00:53.081
I love the public humiliation.

00:53.255 --> 00:56.588
I love the fashion horror show.

01:34.131 --> 01:35.462
That's it?

01:35.633 --> 01:37.567
Nobody has a story idea?

01:37.735 --> 01:39.498
Well, Annie,
it's been kind of a slow week.

01:39.670 --> 01:42.969
I mean, no rappers got arrested,
no movie stars were hospitalized

01:43.140 --> 01:44.630
for "exhaustion. "

01:44.809 --> 01:47.141
Come on, a new trend, a new band.

01:47.311 --> 01:49.006
There must be a story
we haven't done.

01:49.180 --> 01:52.081
<i>Okay,
last night on National Superstars</i>

01:53.618 --> 01:55.813
which I only watched
because my roommates made me,

01:55.987 --> 01:58.251
they announced they're gonna do
their next show in Boston.

01:58.422 --> 01:59.912
Maybe we could do a story on that.

02:00.091 --> 02:01.490
- That show is so lame.
- Yeah.

02:01.659 --> 02:02.990
Come on.

02:03.394 --> 02:05.988
Seriously, I cannot believe
people watch that junk.

02:06.163 --> 02:08.154
There's no way
Clay should have won, okay?

02:08.332 --> 02:09.993
Tanya was so much better.

02:10.167 --> 02:11.464
Tanya is hot.

02:11.636 --> 02:13.103
Rosie O'Donnell hot.

02:13.270 --> 02:15.670
Okay, you all got to get a life,
all right?

02:15.840 --> 02:16.864
Clay rocks.

02:17.041 --> 02:20.477
Okay, great story idea, can't do it.
Absolutely no reporters allowed.

02:20.645 --> 02:23.978
Well, what if I hide my little hat
that says "press"?

02:24.148 --> 02:26.139
No reporters allowed?

02:26.317 --> 02:29.309
Uh, what's the big deal?
It's not like it's a crime scene.

02:29.487 --> 02:32.012
Well, except when Tanya murdered
"My Heart Will Go On. "

02:32.189 --> 02:33.679
Great story idea.

02:33.858 --> 02:37.191
<i>Between you and me, it's been a
dream to be on National Superstars.</i>

02:37.361 --> 02:39.386
I sing the hell
out of "Lady Marmalade. "

02:40.031 --> 02:41.293
That's it.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.626
I'll enter undercover as a contestant.

02:43.801 --> 02:46.292
That way there's nothing stopping me
from getting a great story.

02:46.470 --> 02:48.597
Well, except abject fear.

02:48.773 --> 02:50.331
Well, you probably
wouldn't be so afraid

02:50.508 --> 02:52.976
if you had a, uh, partner in crime?

02:53.144 --> 02:55.112
- I see where you're going, Leonard.
- Ha-ha-ha.

02:55.279 --> 02:57.645
Know what? I'll call Roxie and Morgan
and see if they wanna do it with me.

02:57.815 --> 02:59.715
Yeah, they'll get a kick out of it

02:59.884 --> 03:02.045
and I'll have two more contestants
to interview. Ha, ha.

03:02.219 --> 03:03.243
- Thanks, Leonard.
- Fine.

03:03.421 --> 03:06.288
You can have my dream,
but you're not getting my costume.

03:24.860 --> 03:27.226
<i>As we prepare for our
National Superstars audition,</i>

03:27.396 --> 03:31.594
the air is full of tension, excitement,
and cheap hairspray.

03:31.767 --> 03:34.998
Not to mention people who
aren't reporters talking into their hand.

03:35.170 --> 03:37.502
I know we're kind of being used
to further your career,

03:37.673 --> 03:40.506
but this is the best way
I have been used in years.

03:40.976 --> 03:43.501
- Yeah, thanks for forcing us to do this.
- No problem.

03:43.679 --> 03:45.772
You know, it really
means a lot to have you guys here.

03:45.948 --> 03:47.381
I don't think I could do this alone.

03:47.549 --> 03:49.380
You really are the best pals
a gal ever had.

03:49.551 --> 03:51.746
That's our name. Gal Palz.

03:51.920 --> 03:52.944
But with a Z.

03:53.355 --> 03:56.813
Okay, as long as I don't have
to change my name to Zabrina.

03:57.859 --> 04:01.886
I know we're not here to win,
but that guy's really good.

04:02.064 --> 04:03.122
Yeah, he's all right.

04:03.298 --> 04:05.129
You know, if you like rhythm
and perfect pitch.

04:05.300 --> 04:06.699
But does his name have a Z in it?

04:06.868 --> 04:08.392
<i>- Thank you, Zeke.
- Thank you.</i>

04:09.705 --> 04:12.105
All these people are really good.

04:12.274 --> 04:15.675
Usually, there's at least
one act that stinks.

04:15.978 --> 04:18.105
- Uh-oh.
- I didn't think this through.

04:18.279 --> 04:22.410
If we sing, people are gonna be
celebrating our public humiliation.

04:22.584 --> 04:25.815
And I've never won a contest
where I wasn't wearing a bikini.

04:25.988 --> 04:28.821
I got a lot of flak from the other kids
in the spelling bee for that.

04:28.991 --> 04:31.551
But, guys, guys, wait,
I mean, you can't back out now.

04:31.727 --> 04:34.321
But, I'm so nervous,
I think my throat's closing up.

04:34.496 --> 04:36.191
- I gotta get out of here.
- Me too.

04:36.365 --> 04:38.492
Oh, nothing's ever easy.

04:38.667 --> 04:40.430
<i>We're next to sing
No time to debate</i>

04:40.602 --> 04:43.400
<i>Send me magic lozenges
So our voices sound great</i>

04:43.572 --> 04:45.699
Wow,
"Aunt Lorraine's Talent Lozenges.

04:45.874 --> 04:47.808
Now with 25 percent more talent. "

04:48.310 --> 04:49.402
Guys, wait, look.

04:49.578 --> 04:51.978
Win or lose,
it'll be fun if we do it together.

04:52.147 --> 04:53.910
You know,
you just have pre-audition jitters.

04:54.082 --> 04:56.073
Why don't we all relax
and take a lozenge.

04:56.251 --> 04:59.311
I don't think a simple lozenge
is gonna...

04:59.488 --> 05:01.718
Whoa, this does feel good.

05:02.124 --> 05:03.853
Is this honey lemon,
because I don't really...

05:04.026 --> 05:05.687
Oh, eat it.

05:14.002 --> 05:15.629
And now,
welcome our next contestants

05:15.804 --> 05:18.136
<i>to the National Superstars
auditions.</i>

05:18.540 --> 05:20.167
Gal Palz.

05:21.543 --> 05:23.067
Ladies.

05:29.318 --> 05:30.683
<i>No, you're never gonna get it</i>

05:30.852 --> 05:31.876
Ow!

05:32.054 --> 05:33.078
<i>Never ever gonna get it</i>

05:33.255 --> 05:34.279
<i>No, not this time</i>

05:34.456 --> 05:35.582
<i>No, you're never gonna get it</i>

05:35.757 --> 05:36.781
<i>My love</i>

05:36.958 --> 05:38.220
<i>Never ever gonna get it</i>

05:38.393 --> 05:40.224
<i>Ah, ah, ah</i>

05:40.395 --> 05:44.695
<i>So maybe next time
You give your woman a little respect</i>

05:44.866 --> 05:48.893
<i>So you won't be hearing her say
No way</i>

05:49.071 --> 05:50.231
<i>No you're never gonna get it</i>

05:50.405 --> 05:51.667
<i>Sweet lovin'</i>

05:51.840 --> 05:54.172
<i>- Never ever gonna get it
- Sweet lovin'</i>

05:54.343 --> 05:56.311
<i>- No, you're never ever gonna get it
- My lovin'</i>

05:56.478 --> 05:58.036
<i>Never ever gonna get it</i>

05:58.213 --> 06:00.909
<i>Ooh, bop</i>

06:08.123 --> 06:10.785
Fantastic. Nice job.

06:10.959 --> 06:13.655
We're gonna take a quick break.
We'll be right back after this.

06:13.829 --> 06:15.421
Good job.

06:19.468 --> 06:21.698
Is it me,
or did we actually sound decent?

06:21.870 --> 06:23.269
Decent? We rocked.

06:23.438 --> 06:25.133
Wow, you guys sounded amazing.

06:25.307 --> 06:27.935
Which is weird, because I've heard
the three of you sing in the car.

06:28.110 --> 06:29.941
To be honest,
I thought it was engine trouble.

06:30.112 --> 06:33.878
Well, we practiced, and you know,
this place has really good acoustics.

06:34.049 --> 06:35.949
Plus, we may have taken
some magic lozenges.

06:36.118 --> 06:37.983
So you really thought
we were good?

06:38.153 --> 06:41.645
- Magic lozenges?
- Well, it was an emergency.

06:41.823 --> 06:43.688
You know, Roxie and Morgan
were gonna bail on me

06:43.859 --> 06:45.724
and I wouldn't have an article.

06:45.894 --> 06:47.225
Plus, I did have a little tickle.

06:48.330 --> 06:49.354
Here, you can have them.

06:49.531 --> 06:51.089
See, all through. No harm done.

06:51.266 --> 06:53.325
Sabrina, we're in.
We're semi-finalists.

06:53.502 --> 06:54.764
- What?
- They just announced it.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.904
- Come on.
- This wasn't supposed to happen.

06:57.072 --> 06:58.835
I have what I need for my article.

06:59.007 --> 07:00.565
How's my hair?

07:03.378 --> 07:04.436
"Warning.

07:04.613 --> 07:08.572
Excess exposure to limelight
may have adverse effects. "

07:08.750 --> 07:10.377
Adverse effects?

07:10.552 --> 07:12.076
<i>Thank you, thank you.</i>

07:12.254 --> 07:15.018
<i>Oh, without you people,
we're nothing. Ha, ha.</i>

07:15.190 --> 07:17.556
No, without these you're nothing.

07:17.726 --> 07:20.957
Can you believe that we have hair
and makeup appointments at 10?

07:21.129 --> 07:23.461
I didn't even call until last night.

07:23.632 --> 07:25.623
Well, being famous
means no waiting.

07:25.801 --> 07:27.769
You know, it's too bad
none of us needs a kidney.

07:29.204 --> 07:31.798
Hey, did you guys know there's
someone going through your trash?

07:31.973 --> 07:33.668
Well, Harvey,
we are kind of famous.

07:33.842 --> 07:36.333
I mean everybody wants
their Gal Palz souvenirs.

07:36.511 --> 07:38.376
Everything we touch turns to money.

07:39.448 --> 07:40.847
Hurry up. We're gonna be late.

07:41.716 --> 07:42.978
Aren't you guys going to work?

07:43.151 --> 07:44.584
I'm taking a leave of absence.

07:44.753 --> 07:45.879
They were very understanding.

07:46.054 --> 07:47.715
Of course,
when our record hits number one,

07:47.889 --> 07:50.790
I'll blow off that dead-end job
like a doublewide in Kansas.

07:51.560 --> 07:54.188
And if I had a job to quit,
I'd blow it off too.

07:54.629 --> 07:55.653
Ooh.

07:55.831 --> 07:58.800
Get job. Quit.

08:00.335 --> 08:02.098
And this is my job, remember?

08:02.270 --> 08:03.294
I'm doing a story here.

08:03.472 --> 08:05.337
This isn't about the fame or the glory,
or...

08:06.708 --> 08:07.732
Limo's here. Gotta go.

08:07.909 --> 08:08.933
Hey, wait, wait.

08:09.110 --> 08:11.305
We need to talk about you
and these lozenges

08:11.480 --> 08:13.277
and this little warning label.

08:13.448 --> 08:16.611
Look, just leave any of your concerns
on my machine, okay?

08:20.422 --> 08:22.219
Why are you just sitting there?

08:22.390 --> 08:24.017
Can't you see
that something's wrong?

08:24.192 --> 08:28.026
All I see is a couple of girls
enjoying their moment in the sun.

08:28.497 --> 08:31.125
And it being rained on
by some Harvey downer.

08:31.600 --> 08:35.160
Well, I guess a little fame
isn't such a bad thing.

08:35.337 --> 08:37.804
It gives them a little boost.
A little thrill.

08:37.972 --> 08:40.441
And gives us a lot of cash.

08:40.609 --> 08:42.042
Now, I'll hop on eBay,

08:42.210 --> 08:44.872
you go cut their sheets
into one inch squares.

09:48.677 --> 09:51.407
And now,
the moment all of America,

09:51.580 --> 09:55.016
including Puerto Rico and Guam,
has been waiting for.

09:55.183 --> 09:58.949
<i>Who will be
the two National Superstar finalists?</i>

09:59.120 --> 10:01.588
For some, the dream will end here.

10:01.756 --> 10:04.691
Morgan, wanna explain that shimmy
you did at the end of our number?

10:04.859 --> 10:05.883
Yeah, what was that?

10:06.061 --> 10:07.790
You looked like Tina Turner
having a seizure.

10:07.963 --> 10:09.430
And Roxie, what's with you standing
in front of me during my close-up?

10:09.598 --> 10:10.622
She had to.

10:10.799 --> 10:13.495
We thought you were
gonna French kiss the camera.

10:14.436 --> 10:16.370
Here it is.

10:17.272 --> 10:21.231
<i>Our National Superstar
finalists are...</i>

10:21.409 --> 10:22.433
Zeke Tyler.

10:23.812 --> 10:24.836
Thank you.

10:25.213 --> 10:26.441
Oh, please.

10:26.848 --> 10:29.316
- Pity vote.
- It's all about his hair.

10:31.152 --> 10:33.211
And our other finalist is...

10:35.824 --> 10:38.691
Or should I say are.

10:38.860 --> 10:40.418
Gal Palz.

10:43.999 --> 10:47.400
Ladies, congratulations.
We all know you're good friends.

10:47.569 --> 10:51.096
But did you ever dream
you would make it this far as singers?

10:51.272 --> 10:54.241
- No, actually, I just wanna say that...
- Not in a million years.

10:54.409 --> 10:56.468
Not unless it was as a solo act.

10:57.946 --> 10:59.709
Which might happen
sooner than you think.

10:59.881 --> 11:02.748
Mr. Colin, I always believed
I would make it in music.

11:02.917 --> 11:05.408
If I could just find the right singers
to back up my voice.

11:05.587 --> 11:07.782
Hello? They might wanna hear
what the blonde has to say.

11:07.956 --> 11:10.151
After all, I'm the one
who started this singing group.

11:10.325 --> 11:12.122
Well, let the blonde say
what she wants.

11:12.293 --> 11:15.353
- She always does.
- Yes, you always do.

11:15.530 --> 11:17.589
Even though, based on our fan mail,

11:17.766 --> 11:20.667
people seem to be a bit more
interested in the redhead

11:20.835 --> 11:22.962
then they are in the blonde.

11:23.138 --> 11:25.629
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't walk away from me.

11:25.807 --> 11:27.172
You can't do this without me.

11:27.342 --> 11:28.434
I pick the songs.

11:28.610 --> 11:31.977
I arrange them, and I drove.

11:34.685 --> 11:38.280
<i>And to the right is
the couch where the Gal Palz kick back</i>

11:38.455 --> 11:41.822
<i>and watch the tube
as they sip their favorite libation,</i>

11:41.992 --> 11:45.155
<i>strawberry smoothies,
available in the kitchen for 3.95.</i>

11:45.328 --> 11:46.556
What is all the racket?

11:46.730 --> 11:49.164
I mean, can't someone get a little
peace and quiet around here

11:49.332 --> 11:50.765
while they recharge their creative...

11:50.934 --> 11:52.196
For the love of crying out loud.

11:52.369 --> 11:54.269
I'm sorry,
the help enters through the back door.

11:54.438 --> 11:56.429
Need the bathroom?
There's a Chevron on the corner.

11:56.606 --> 11:59.439
<i>And there's some
of that sassy Sabrina spirit</i>

11:59.609 --> 12:02.271
<i>we've all come to love.</i>

12:05.382 --> 12:06.610
Salem, what are you doing?

12:06.783 --> 12:09.547
Cashing in, Your Diva-ness.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.312
These people aren't the help.

12:11.488 --> 12:15.151
They're paying customers,
tourists, your fans.

12:17.260 --> 12:19.820
The little people.
Oh, thank you all so much for coming.

12:19.996 --> 12:21.190
I love all of you like family.

12:21.364 --> 12:23.696
Now, exit through the kitchen
and try not to touch anything.

12:23.867 --> 12:25.858
Bye-bye.
I'm glad I can make your day.

12:26.036 --> 12:28.527
Oh, who am I kidding? Your life.

12:28.705 --> 12:31.071
Oh, and where do you two think
you're going?

12:31.241 --> 12:33.766
If you think that I'm spending
one more minute in this house

12:33.944 --> 12:37.402
after your scene-stealing tantrum
last night, think again.

12:37.581 --> 12:40.414
I am not
the wind beneath your wings.

12:40.584 --> 12:42.484
I am a star in my own right.

12:43.987 --> 12:45.477
In your own mind.

12:47.424 --> 12:50.723
This whole suburban granny's house
thing is so not Roxie King.

12:50.894 --> 12:55.957
It's frumpy, it's dated, it's drab,
but it works for you. Ciao.

12:56.133 --> 12:57.430
Fine. You know what?

12:57.601 --> 13:00.968
You two just saved me the trouble
of having to throw the two of you out.

13:01.138 --> 13:02.605
Thanks for getting the door.

13:02.773 --> 13:04.434
It's in your future. Get used to it.

13:05.809 --> 13:07.242
<i>I'm off to my photo shoot at Scorch.</i>

13:08.612 --> 13:10.273
Oh, look, there's my limo now.

13:10.447 --> 13:11.641
What do you mean your limo?

13:11.815 --> 13:13.282
And what do you mean
your photo shoot?

13:13.683 --> 13:15.344
Oh, it's the black limo.

13:15.519 --> 13:18.716
You take it, Roxie.
It's more slimming.

13:20.056 --> 13:22.820
Unh! I want a limo.

13:22.993 --> 13:26.190
Hey, what's going on?
I had to pay $15 to get in here.

13:26.363 --> 13:28.957
<i>For an extra 5, you can see the car</i>

13:29.132 --> 13:30.394
<i>and rub the cat's tummy.</i>

13:30.567 --> 13:31.591
Can it, Salem.

13:31.768 --> 13:33.065
I have to talk to you.

13:33.236 --> 13:36.967
I tried to catch you last night,
but I couldn't keep up with your limo.

13:37.140 --> 13:39.370
Oh, was that you
banging on the trunk?

13:39.543 --> 13:40.942
Look, Harvey, I have no time, okay?

13:41.111 --> 13:43.636
I have to volumize my hair
and launch a solo career before lunch.

13:43.814 --> 13:46.339
Ha, ha, ha. Like I eat lunch anymore.

13:46.516 --> 13:49.212
Would you quit the diva act
for two seconds and listen?

13:49.386 --> 13:51.581
Look, on the lozenge box it says:

13:51.755 --> 13:55.316
"Exposure to limelight
may have adverse effects. "

13:55.492 --> 13:58.154
What? It's not like I'm gonna be
operating heavy machinery.

13:58.328 --> 14:00.796
Don't you get it?
These are adverse effects.

14:00.964 --> 14:05.060
All this fame is making you act
like some kind of egotistical movie star.

14:05.235 --> 14:06.361
Really? Which one?

14:06.536 --> 14:08.401
Because I get Meg Ryan a lot.

14:08.805 --> 14:11.239
I didn't wanna have to do this,
but you leave me no choice.

14:13.343 --> 14:15.436
This is last night's show.

14:15.612 --> 14:17.705
<i>Don't walk away from me.
You can't do this without me.</i>

14:17.881 --> 14:18.905
<i>I pick the songs.</i>

14:19.082 --> 14:20.208
<i>I arrange...</i>

14:20.884 --> 14:23.284
Oh, my gosh. I was so ugly.

14:23.453 --> 14:26.217
Yeah.
You really did look like a witch.

14:26.623 --> 14:28.887
I am out of control.

14:29.059 --> 14:31.926
Did I really call Roxie and Morgan
no-talent hacks?

14:32.095 --> 14:33.995
If only you'd been that nice.

14:34.164 --> 14:37.725
Maybe I need to check you
into some kind of diva detox center.

14:37.901 --> 14:40.768
No, no, now that I know
what's going on, I can handle it.

14:40.937 --> 14:44.668
I just have to stay out of the limelight
and pull Roxie and Morgan out of it too

14:44.841 --> 14:47.309
before it completely destroys
our friendship.

14:47.477 --> 14:48.501
Come on, I'll drive.

14:50.046 --> 14:51.570
It can't always be a limo.

14:52.482 --> 14:55.417
You're right. Right.

14:55.585 --> 14:58.577
But I'm riding in the back
and you're wearing a hat.

15:00.156 --> 15:02.818
So, uh, how do you rate
your competition in the finals?

15:02.993 --> 15:04.324
Oh, please.

15:04.494 --> 15:08.430
Roxie has two left feet
and Sabrina you'd think had three.

15:08.598 --> 15:10.463
I meant the other finalists.

15:12.202 --> 15:13.726
All right, Roxie, I think we're done.

15:13.904 --> 15:15.769
Done? We haven't even started.

15:15.939 --> 15:19.136
We've only shot coy Roxie
and pouty Roxie.

15:19.309 --> 15:24.975
My fans deserve to see
serious Roxie and sporty Roxie.

15:25.849 --> 15:27.749
I got a Roxie I'd like to show them.

15:27.918 --> 15:29.112
Autopsy Roxie.

15:31.288 --> 15:34.052
Oh, finally, the last of our divas
has arrived.

15:34.224 --> 15:37.216
I'm assuming you'll want your own hair
and makeup people and bottled water.

15:37.394 --> 15:39.385
No, no, no.
It's just me, Sabrina.

15:39.562 --> 15:40.654
Lowly little Sabrina.

15:40.830 --> 15:42.764
I came to talk to my friends
and get out of here.

15:42.933 --> 15:44.525
Morgan, come on, we're leaving.

15:44.701 --> 15:46.726
First of all,
I am not even talking to you.

15:46.903 --> 15:49.303
Second of all, everything has to be
booked through my manager.

15:49.472 --> 15:52.532
And third of all, my manager
isn't talking to you either.

15:52.709 --> 15:53.767
Morgan, listen to me.

15:53.944 --> 15:57.107
We've got to get out of the limelight.
It's destroying us and our friendship.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.043
I mean, who cares about fame
and fortune

15:59.215 --> 16:01.183
and our faces pasted on billboards?

16:01.351 --> 16:03.717
Uh, let me see. I do.

16:03.887 --> 16:06.583
Excuse me. Can I take
a couple of pictures of you guys?

16:06.756 --> 16:09.316
No, no, no.
No pictures, no flashes, no fawning.

16:10.293 --> 16:12.090
Not until I finish my makeup.

16:12.262 --> 16:13.752
Oh, no. It's happening.

16:13.930 --> 16:15.864
Must resist the limelight.

16:16.032 --> 16:17.932
Stop. And you have to too, Morgan.

16:18.101 --> 16:20.001
Right, I've never resisted anything.

16:20.170 --> 16:21.330
Click away, shutterbug.

16:21.504 --> 16:23.062
Are you taking photos without me?

16:23.239 --> 16:24.399
I know what's going on.

16:24.574 --> 16:26.269
You're trying to force me
out of the group.

16:26.443 --> 16:28.468
No, no, no.
I'm trying to force you out the door.

16:28.645 --> 16:30.237
Okay, all this fame
has gone to our heads

16:30.413 --> 16:32.108
and we've become
awful ugly people.

16:32.282 --> 16:35.615
Speak for yourself, Spellman.
My photos turned out great.

16:35.785 --> 16:38.652
Guys, if you remember anything about
our friendship, you'll remember that

16:38.822 --> 16:41.382
I'm the one who started this group.

16:41.558 --> 16:43.253
Ooh. Oh. No.

16:43.426 --> 16:45.087
Must protect my friends.

16:45.261 --> 16:47.456
Friends are fleeting.
Fans are forever.

16:47.630 --> 16:49.723
No, no, must stop.

16:49.899 --> 16:51.264
Must be real person.

16:51.968 --> 16:53.765
As soon as I finish this roll.

16:53.937 --> 16:56.497
Love me, love me, love me.

16:56.673 --> 16:59.107
Sorry, Sabrina,
I finally found a parking...

16:59.275 --> 17:00.435
Oh, no.

17:00.944 --> 17:03.003
All right.
We gotta get you out of here.

17:03.179 --> 17:06.204
Apparently, you're not as strong
as you thought you were.

17:06.383 --> 17:08.544
Oh, neither am I.

17:09.819 --> 17:10.843
What am I gonna do?

17:11.021 --> 17:13.512
I mean, I can't spend the rest of my life
locked in this house.

17:13.690 --> 17:15.749
For one thing,
we're almost out of Fudgesicles.

17:15.925 --> 17:18.723
It's hard to believe that something
billed as cool and refreshing

17:18.895 --> 17:20.863
can be so dark and destructive.

17:21.031 --> 17:22.224
Well, you can throw those away.

17:22.398 --> 17:24.492
I mean, they're the reason
I got into this whole mess.

17:25.001 --> 17:26.695
I want to give Aunt Lorraine
a piece of my...

17:26.869 --> 17:28.098
Wait a minute. That's it.

17:28.271 --> 17:30.967
I gotta get to the source
of my problem.

17:32.308 --> 17:35.402
Aunt Lorraine,
when your throat's a pain.

17:35.578 --> 17:36.636
Listen, Lorraine.

17:36.813 --> 17:38.508
I've had a real problem
with your lozenges.

17:38.681 --> 17:42.173
Whatever your problem is,
there was a warning label.

17:42.352 --> 17:43.376
Here's a warning:

17:43.553 --> 17:45.453
If you don't help me,
I'll twist your bun off.

17:45.622 --> 17:50.059
Hey, you're Sabrina from Gal Palz.

17:50.226 --> 17:54.492
Listen, the guys in marketing say
I'm scaring off the kids.

17:54.664 --> 17:57.258
How would you like to be
our new spokesperson?

17:57.634 --> 17:58.658
Me?

17:58.835 --> 18:00.860
Well, I have always wanted to do
endorsements.

18:01.037 --> 18:02.527
And then, of course, directing.

18:02.705 --> 18:04.832
- Diva alert.
- Thanks.

18:05.008 --> 18:08.375
Look, Raspy, just give me the antidote
that will make this all go away.

18:08.545 --> 18:11.537
Sorry, kid.
I just gave you a little talent.

18:11.714 --> 18:14.877
The media and the public made you
what you are today.

18:15.051 --> 18:19.215
- Bitter, hateful, self-centered.
- Okay, we know what the problem is.

18:19.389 --> 18:21.983
And only they can tear you down.

18:23.393 --> 18:26.487
- What did she mean tear you down?
- Who knows?

18:26.663 --> 18:28.824
She probably meant that society loves
to build people up

18:28.998 --> 18:30.022
and then tear them down.

18:30.300 --> 18:32.962
That's it.
We just need to be torn down.

18:33.903 --> 18:34.927
Okay.

18:35.105 --> 18:37.903
Gal Palz needs a scandal.

18:41.077 --> 18:42.135
Zeke Tyler.

18:42.312 --> 18:43.802
Zeke, well done.

18:43.980 --> 18:47.711
And now,
let's welcome our last finalist.

18:47.884 --> 18:50.250
Gal Palz.

18:56.092 --> 18:57.787
Ladies, this is it.

18:57.961 --> 18:59.360
This is your big...

19:01.131 --> 19:04.259
Has someone come down
with a sudden case of stage fright?

19:04.801 --> 19:07.634
Nope, I'd just rather stay over here
out of the limelight.

19:07.804 --> 19:09.032
Out of the limelight?

19:09.205 --> 19:11.298
This is what it's all about.

19:11.474 --> 19:13.101
What is wrong with you?

19:13.610 --> 19:15.271
Colin, I have to come clean.

19:16.045 --> 19:18.309
I broke the rules of this contest.

19:18.481 --> 19:20.449
<i>I'm a reporter for Scorch Magazine.</i>

19:23.086 --> 19:26.988
I posed as a contestant to get a story
and I dragged my friends into it.

19:27.157 --> 19:28.419
I'm really sorry.

19:31.561 --> 19:32.585
Well, I'm sorry.

19:32.762 --> 19:36.858
Because that means
Gal Palz is disqualified.

19:40.270 --> 19:44.036
Which means the winner
is Zeke Tyler.

19:44.207 --> 19:45.265
Come on up here, Zeke.

19:51.047 --> 19:53.345
<i>Zeke, Zeke!</i>

19:53.850 --> 19:55.078
How could you?

19:55.251 --> 19:57.082
You've ruined everything.

19:57.253 --> 19:59.813
I didn't ruin everything.
I saved something.

19:59.989 --> 20:01.183
Our friendship?

20:02.358 --> 20:04.519
Look, I had to destroy Gal Palz
with a Z

20:04.694 --> 20:07.288
so that girlfriends with an S
could survive.

20:07.697 --> 20:10.393
Oh, my God. It's really over.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.569
It's like we don't matter anymore.

20:13.736 --> 20:15.465
But you guys matter to me.

20:15.638 --> 20:18.402
And believe me, there was a time
when I completely forgot that.

20:18.575 --> 20:22.011
You know, I got so wrapped up
in my solo act, my acting career,

20:22.178 --> 20:24.146
my fragrance.

20:24.314 --> 20:25.804
Now, stay on track.

20:25.982 --> 20:28.450
I'm not saying
it's bad to be a nobody.

20:28.618 --> 20:31.985
And actually it feels kind of good
to be a normal person.

20:32.155 --> 20:34.919
Oh, Roxie, you'll never be normal.

20:35.491 --> 20:36.685
So you guys are okay with this?

20:36.859 --> 20:38.554
Just going back to being
three regular girls

20:38.728 --> 20:40.252
living in a granny house
in the suburbs?

20:40.430 --> 20:44.196
- No limos, no adoring fans, no perks.
- Except for the best one of all.

20:46.035 --> 20:48.196
Morgan, are you okay with this?

20:48.471 --> 20:49.995
Yeah.

20:51.407 --> 20:53.534
Is the no-limos part negotiable?

20:59.850 --> 21:02.318
Oh, Suzanne
is definitely gonna get the rose.

21:02.486 --> 21:04.579
No way. Chad is so over her.

21:04.755 --> 21:06.154
He's giving the rose to Cindy.

21:06.323 --> 21:08.723
No, no, he's giving Cindy the boot.
It's gonna be Jennifer.

21:08.892 --> 21:10.826
Hey, you know what?

21:10.994 --> 21:13.053
I heard this show
is coming to Boston next week.

21:13.230 --> 21:16.597
- Maybe we should...
- Turn off the TV.

21:20.437 --> 21:22.405
Sabrina!
