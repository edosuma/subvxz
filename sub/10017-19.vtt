00:15.420 --> 00:16.478
-Carter!
-Dr. Benton.

00:16.687 --> 00:17.984
Did you pick up my labs?

00:18.188 --> 00:19.313
-Where's Deb?
-Sick.

00:19.522 --> 00:20.887
Who said so? What is that?

00:21.090 --> 00:23.023
-Two feet of necrotic bowel.
-For what?

00:23.224 --> 00:25.817
Taking it to the desk.
Research is picking it up.

00:26.026 --> 00:27.049
Soon, l hope.

00:27.260 --> 00:29.784
Guy infarcted, needed
a crash hemicolectomy.

00:29.995 --> 00:32.326
-When?
-A couple of hours ago.

00:32.530 --> 00:34.087
-Who did the procedure?
-Jagman.

00:34.297 --> 00:36.025
Jagman? Damn!

00:36.231 --> 00:37.926
Why didn't you admit the woman
with sores?

00:38.132 --> 00:39.394
Her problem isn't surgical.

00:39.601 --> 00:42.364
She needs to be dÃ©brided.
Otherwise, she won't heal.

00:42.569 --> 00:45.695
Maybe medicine will help,
but she's not coming on my service.

00:45.904 --> 00:49.202
Those Dale Carnegie classes
are really starting to show.

00:49.440 --> 00:51.771
He's been on for 48 hours straight.

00:51.975 --> 00:54.965
Traded a few shifts to be
with his mom, and now it's....

00:55.176 --> 00:56.575
Payback time.

00:56.944 --> 01:00.673
There's a Code Brown in 2.
Find a nurse, clean it up now! Move.

01:00.879 --> 01:03.403
Unfortunately, payback rolls downhill.

01:09.618 --> 01:11.676
-Did l miss her breakfast?
-Just starting.

01:11.885 --> 01:14.853
The Family Development person
came by for three hours.

01:15.054 --> 01:18.250
Ms. Brown called. She said
you passed with flying colors.

01:18.457 --> 01:20.321
They're expediting your application.

01:20.524 --> 01:22.491
Helen, l can't thank you enough.

01:22.692 --> 01:23.680
How's she been?

01:23.892 --> 01:26.655
Fever's gone, but l think
she's homesick.

01:45.805 --> 01:48.568
She misses the nurse
she was close to in Russia.

01:50.341 --> 01:52.331
Can l ask if she wants
to live with me?

01:52.542 --> 01:53.566
Sure.

02:08.151 --> 02:10.414
Yes, l have a VCR.

02:15.156 --> 02:16.144
Hey, Doug.

02:16.857 --> 02:20.985
ls that Mark Greene,
the future ER attending?

02:21.626 --> 02:23.923
-You found out.
-Not from you, schmuck.

02:24.128 --> 02:28.222
l didn't want it to get out until
Morgenstern made the announcement.

02:28.430 --> 02:31.296
-Word's out. Congratulations.
-Thanks.

02:31.499 --> 02:32.726
What did Jen say?

02:32.932 --> 02:36.094
She signed on for another
year with the judge.

02:36.301 --> 02:38.029
ln Milwaukee? Oh, no.

02:38.236 --> 02:42.227
lt's been awful.
But if l can make this shot...

02:42.438 --> 02:44.632
...there's still hope for my marriage.

02:45.140 --> 02:46.129
There's hope.

02:46.741 --> 02:48.105
When did the rash appear?

02:48.308 --> 02:51.071
Two days ago, with a fever.

02:51.444 --> 02:52.705
lt started on your chest?

02:52.911 --> 02:55.071
Yeah. Then it spread.

02:55.312 --> 02:57.575
l think l'm allergic
to one of the medications.

02:57.781 --> 02:59.771
-What are you taking?
-Here.

03:02.116 --> 03:05.880
P-43B, ZX-7.

03:06.085 --> 03:07.313
l've never heard of these.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.817
They're experimental.
l'm a test subject.

03:11.655 --> 03:14.623
l answer those ads in the paper:
''lf you suffer from...

03:14.824 --> 03:19.122
...asthma, nicotine addiction, panic attacks,
call this number. Earn extra cash.''

03:19.326 --> 03:21.122
-They pay you?
-Oh, yeah.

03:21.327 --> 03:24.022
l'm doing this one where they inject...

03:25.396 --> 03:29.058
...radioactive isotopes into my brain.
That one pays real well.

03:29.266 --> 03:32.165
We'll call the numbers on the vials,
to see which drug...

03:32.367 --> 03:37.268
...is causing your reaction. But for
now, your test subject days are over.

03:40.972 --> 03:42.097
How much you make a year?

03:42.339 --> 03:44.499
-Did you stick Mr. Penny for blood gases?
-Yes.

03:44.708 --> 03:47.403
-Discharge the abscess?
-Just need your signature.

03:47.609 --> 03:48.905
Dr. Hicks.

03:49.677 --> 03:51.803
l wasn't called for
the bowel infarction?

03:52.012 --> 03:53.070
You traded shifts.

03:53.280 --> 03:57.374
-l was the resident on call.
-You've been on for 48 hours straight.

03:57.582 --> 03:59.446
What does that have to do with it?

03:59.616 --> 04:00.605
Have you slept?

04:00.817 --> 04:02.910
l need very little sleep.
l am capable--

04:03.118 --> 04:07.577
l didn't think so. You shouldn't be
treating patients in your condition.

04:07.788 --> 04:10.584
l've never done a bowel infarction.
Jagman has done two.

04:10.789 --> 04:13.450
-This isn't a competition.
-Oh, no?

04:14.192 --> 04:16.853
Then why do we have to keep logs
of every procedure?

04:17.060 --> 04:18.993
As a record. Not a scorecard.

04:19.195 --> 04:21.661
Right. You're keeping score
and you know it.

04:21.863 --> 04:25.160
That's enough. Your fatigue
is impairing your judgment.

04:25.364 --> 04:28.264
-Go and lie down, two hours.
-That won't be necessary.

04:28.467 --> 04:33.095
This isn't a suggestion. You will not
see another patient until you've slept.

05:23.866 --> 05:28.392
Are you kidding? We don't have time
for this. Turf the kid to Medicine.

05:28.602 --> 05:32.297
l tried. Got into an argument
with Warner. She won't come down.

05:32.504 --> 05:36.370
Screaming doesn't work with her.
You have to use ''soft sell.'' Observe.

05:36.572 --> 05:38.164
Morning, Jer.
What do you got?

05:38.374 --> 05:40.466
Full house, take your pick.

05:41.108 --> 05:44.372
Dr. Ross, Diane Leeds in Risk
Management called for you.

05:44.577 --> 05:45.634
What did she want?

05:45.844 --> 05:48.676
-She said she wants to go out with you.
-What?

05:48.880 --> 05:51.712
Just kidding. Think it was about
that guy you decked.

05:51.915 --> 05:54.906
Did l ever tell you you're my
least favorite clerk?

05:55.150 --> 05:58.607
l am not a clerk. l'm an
''emergency service coordinator.''

05:58.819 --> 06:01.013
Doug, we got a burn in 1 .

06:01.687 --> 06:04.984
Here. Write these labs.
l'll take that knee lac in 5.

06:05.189 --> 06:07.452
-l noticed Exam 4 is open.
-What?

06:07.657 --> 06:10.420
ln case you wanna go lie down,
take a nap or something.

06:13.828 --> 06:18.525
lt was a great catch, Joyce.
l never would've thought of sickle cell.

06:21.965 --> 06:25.525
Yes, you do.
Anyway, l do have a favor.

06:26.068 --> 06:30.503
This kid on experimental meds is getting
worse. Susan can't make anything of it.

06:30.704 --> 06:34.365
Could you please come down here
and bail her out?

06:35.474 --> 06:36.770
Thank you.

06:37.909 --> 06:40.432
-Here you go. She's on her way down.
-Thanks.

06:41.977 --> 06:43.500
How did this happen?

06:43.711 --> 06:44.837
lt's my fault.

06:45.046 --> 06:48.502
The knob came off the radiator
and she grabbed the metal part.

06:48.714 --> 06:51.443
Wiggle your fingers for me.
Just wiggle them.

06:53.584 --> 06:56.814
-You okay?
-lt's my fault.

06:58.954 --> 07:02.547
lt's a second-degree burn
that won't affect the use of her hand.

07:02.756 --> 07:07.282
We're gonna clean it up with saline.
Bonnie, you hang in there, okay?

07:10.027 --> 07:12.051
Never seen a star-shaped
radiator knob.

07:12.261 --> 07:16.094
l'm gonna call other hospitals.
See if she's been seen anywhere else.

07:19.399 --> 07:20.798
Excuse me!

07:21.233 --> 07:22.222
Excuse me!

07:22.434 --> 07:24.799
Malik, get a gurney!

07:25.169 --> 07:26.157
What happened?

07:26.369 --> 07:29.633
He just finished breakfast
when he keels over...

07:29.839 --> 07:32.773
...starts shivering, his eyes
roll back in his head....

07:32.973 --> 07:35.338
-What is it?
-A seizure, grand mal type.

07:35.508 --> 07:37.271
Curtain 2 is open.
No tongue abrasions.

07:37.476 --> 07:39.272
No signs of incontinence.
You related?

07:39.477 --> 07:41.967
-No, l manage the restaurant.
-Thank you.

07:42.179 --> 07:43.475
Just a sec.

07:43.947 --> 07:47.244
Look. lf he's okay, have
him call me, okay?

07:49.083 --> 07:51.846
l know this sounds bad,
but he didn't pay the check.

07:52.484 --> 07:57.044
He had the champagne brunch,
steak and eggs. lt was a $35 meal!

07:57.921 --> 08:00.150
Neighbor found him at the
bottom of the stairs.

08:00.356 --> 08:04.051
-Vitals?
-80 over 60, heart's racing at 1 28.

08:04.491 --> 08:06.651
-lV in?
-No. Couldn't find a vein.

08:06.860 --> 08:09.054
Haleh, prep for a central line.

08:12.864 --> 08:15.797
-Let's get him across on my count.
-Get a cordis tray.

08:15.998 --> 08:19.057
We're gonna do this nice
and gentle. Do you hear me?

08:19.267 --> 08:22.133
One, two, three. Go.
Here we go.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.734
Watch the line.

08:25.204 --> 08:27.137
Capillary refill's poor.

08:27.339 --> 08:28.999
The old guy's got a G-tube.

08:29.206 --> 08:30.467
-His name?
-Joseph Klein.

08:30.673 --> 08:33.072
-Hypotensive. BP's 50 palp.
-Pedal edema.

08:33.275 --> 08:36.765
-Congestive heart failure.
-No breath sounds. Lung's collapsed.

08:36.943 --> 08:39.173
-Must have broken a rib.
-He's a train wreck.

08:39.379 --> 08:40.777
Get a chest tube tray.

08:41.212 --> 08:42.975
Can you understand me?
Talk to me.

08:43.181 --> 08:45.910
He can't. Look at his neck.
No voice box.

08:47.516 --> 08:49.006
Can we give him something?

08:49.217 --> 08:51.946
-Stand by with morphine, 2 mg.
-Who's got keys?

08:52.152 --> 08:53.982
28 French. Move.

08:54.954 --> 08:56.284
Unit of Lasix.

08:56.855 --> 08:59.152
80 mg, lV push.

08:59.357 --> 09:00.688
Get some restraints in here.

09:02.359 --> 09:03.586
He wants the morphine now.

09:03.792 --> 09:06.385
-Over here, now. Move!
-Line's in.

09:06.594 --> 09:10.120
Load the dopamine, 400 mg.
250 D5W.

09:10.330 --> 09:12.593
We'll take care of you.
lt's gonna be okay.

09:13.865 --> 09:16.833
-Pressure's 1 20 over 80. Not bad.
-Reflexes are normal.

09:17.034 --> 09:19.297
-l don't see signs of a seizure, do you?
-No.

09:19.669 --> 09:21.101
Has an irregular heartbeat.

09:22.237 --> 09:24.534
-He just opened his eye.
-Really?

09:30.541 --> 09:34.374
Hello in there. l know you're
busy having a coma.

09:34.577 --> 09:36.545
Do you wanna tell us why, Mr...?

09:37.045 --> 09:38.034
Do we have a name?

09:38.246 --> 09:43.181
Actually, we have several.
Art Moss, Sam Hart and Gene Finch.

09:43.616 --> 09:48.517
Me again. l wanna let you know that you
actually do have a medical problem.

09:48.718 --> 09:51.481
We're going to have to go in.
Rib spreader!

09:56.590 --> 09:58.648
Helluva way to get a free meal.

09:58.858 --> 10:00.325
-Can you get bloods?
-BP?

10:00.526 --> 10:02.015
Still low. 60 palp.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.955
lncrease the dopamine. 1 0 mics.

10:04.161 --> 10:06.185
-Got a number 1 0 blade?
-On the tray.

10:06.396 --> 10:07.693
Hang in there, Mr. Klein.

10:08.931 --> 10:10.192
Let's have it.

10:10.398 --> 10:13.264
Came in with congestive
heart failure, tension pneumo.

10:13.466 --> 10:16.764
He's on high-dose dopamine.
Peter's putting in a chest tube.

10:16.969 --> 10:17.992
l'll take it from here.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.191
l got it.

10:19.470 --> 10:21.562
l'll take it from here.

10:21.772 --> 10:25.604
Either get some sleep or go home.
l won't tell you again.

10:36.646 --> 10:38.409
Mr. Klein's old chart came up.

10:38.615 --> 10:39.740
Can l see it?

10:40.516 --> 10:42.676
Check to see what meds he's on.

10:43.251 --> 10:44.512
Chest tube's in.

10:45.085 --> 10:46.881
We got breath sounds.

10:47.219 --> 10:49.209
Pulse ox up to 90 from 82.

10:49.421 --> 10:50.887
Train is back on the tracks.

10:51.255 --> 10:52.950
Nice job, everybody.

10:53.156 --> 10:55.249
Mr. Klein has terminal cancer.

10:55.891 --> 10:58.188
The last time he was here,
he signed a paper...

10:58.392 --> 11:01.724
...requesting no heroic measures
be taken to prolong his life.

11:16.136 --> 11:18.296
You and Jen are going
another year like this?

11:18.504 --> 11:20.266
l guess we're gonna have to.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.268
Congrats on the new attending gig.

11:22.473 --> 11:24.235
Jen is adamant about Milwaukee?

11:24.441 --> 11:28.433
She wants me to move there.
l can't give up this job as attending.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.668
-Can l help you?
-Dr. Greene, right?

11:30.878 --> 11:34.039
John Koch. MlT, Sloan School
of Management.

11:34.246 --> 11:36.907
-What can l do for you?
-They didn't call you?

11:37.115 --> 11:41.641
l'm here to observe your department.
Doing research for the Andover Project.

11:42.819 --> 11:45.752
White House press conference,
profile on CNN?

11:45.953 --> 11:48.716
-Must've missed it.
-We're building a new hospital...

11:48.922 --> 11:51.913
...for the 21 st century,
scrapping the old model...

11:52.124 --> 11:54.284
...in favor of a more
collaborative paradigm.

11:54.492 --> 11:55.617
Like a team approach?

11:55.826 --> 11:57.884
Yes, but on a comprehensive scale.

11:58.094 --> 12:01.654
We're rethinking the hospital
architecturally, organizationally...

12:01.863 --> 12:05.422
...ergonomically.
We hope to build the model...

12:05.631 --> 12:08.394
...on which all future hospitals
will be based.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.193
So you'd like to see how it
shouldn't be done?

12:11.402 --> 12:15.496
On the contrary. l want to keep
what works and change what doesn't.

12:15.704 --> 12:17.933
-Feel free to look around.
-Great.

12:19.072 --> 12:23.633
l may have a solution to you
and your wife's geographic impasse.

12:23.842 --> 12:26.275
-Excuse me?
-Kenosha. Midway between...

12:26.477 --> 12:28.944
...Chicago and Milwaukee.
Commute's barely an hour.

12:29.145 --> 12:31.578
You can live under one roof
and keep your jobs.

12:46.155 --> 12:49.612
l'm John Carter. You might
remember me from earlier.

12:52.059 --> 12:56.517
l brought a pad and a pen,
in case you want to say something.

12:57.995 --> 13:00.428
l'll put them here
on the end of the table.

13:01.097 --> 13:03.587
l'm sorry about what happened earlier.

13:05.700 --> 13:09.156
Your blood pressure's still pretty low,
so l contacted your HMO...

13:09.368 --> 13:12.859
...and they'll take you to their
hospital, once you've stabilized.

13:13.071 --> 13:15.368
But that might be a while.

13:18.441 --> 13:22.569
There's no next of kin listed in
your chart. ls there anyone l can call?

13:26.745 --> 13:28.143
Can you understand me?

13:46.357 --> 13:48.017
l'm sorry, l didn't--

14:13.306 --> 14:14.431
''Roger.''

14:14.940 --> 14:17.203
Roger. ls he a family member?

14:17.442 --> 14:19.170
ls it your son?

14:23.178 --> 14:24.941
Do you know his telephone number?

14:31.583 --> 14:32.708
Bloomington.

14:33.384 --> 14:35.078
He lives in Bloomington.

14:35.285 --> 14:38.515
He lives in Bloomington,
and his name is Roger Klein.

14:39.654 --> 14:41.281
Okay, great.

14:43.557 --> 14:45.421
l will be back in a little bit.

14:52.428 --> 14:54.520
Any interest in
becoming charge nurse?

14:54.729 --> 14:57.629
Me? Not on your life.

14:58.898 --> 14:59.922
Why do you ask?

15:01.667 --> 15:05.727
Because Tag and l are gonna be foster
parents to that little Russian girl.

15:05.936 --> 15:07.198
The one with AlDS?

15:07.437 --> 15:10.303
Tatiana. l wanna spend as much
time as l can with her.

15:10.572 --> 15:11.903
l'm cutting back my shifts.

15:12.540 --> 15:13.597
Really?

15:14.541 --> 15:15.529
What?

15:15.708 --> 15:18.403
lt seems like a tough way
to start off a marriage.

15:19.377 --> 15:21.071
You think it's a bad idea?

15:22.745 --> 15:27.544
lt doesn't matter what l think.
l'm certainly no expert on marriage.

15:28.082 --> 15:29.673
Forget l said anything.

15:32.118 --> 15:35.211
Mercy General's calling
about a kid with a burned hand.

15:36.588 --> 15:37.884
l'll be right back.

15:49.228 --> 15:51.025
-Didn't mean to wake you.
-You didn't.

15:51.229 --> 15:54.197
-Came for a blood gas kit.
-Any traumas come in?

15:55.265 --> 15:57.391
Two-car accident.
lt went up to the O.R.

15:57.600 --> 16:01.193
Who's doing it? Never mind,
don't tell me. Half-hour to go.

16:03.803 --> 16:05.895
Watch the charts.
Bring me anything surgical.

16:06.104 --> 16:09.595
l thought we had to wait
until we're called for a consult.

16:12.408 --> 16:13.897
Just do it, all right?

16:19.678 --> 16:21.873
Can we see you outside, please?

16:22.514 --> 16:24.379
l'll be right back.

16:27.150 --> 16:30.641
Your daughter was seen at another
hospital with a star-shaped burn.

16:30.852 --> 16:32.648
We want to know what's going on.

16:32.853 --> 16:37.379
-She touched the radiator.
-This is not a radiator burn, ma'am.

16:37.589 --> 16:39.351
Now, what really happened?

16:41.491 --> 16:44.653
-lt's personal.
-Maybe l can talk with her alone.

16:48.896 --> 16:52.387
l'm sure there's a reasonable
explanation for what's happening.

16:53.398 --> 16:55.298
But if you want me to help Bonnie...

16:55.499 --> 16:57.763
...you have to tell me the truth.

16:59.335 --> 17:01.131
Most people don't understand.

17:02.037 --> 17:03.799
l'm pretty understanding.

17:05.204 --> 17:07.502
You promise you won't tell the doctor?

17:12.643 --> 17:15.805
She touches herself. Down there.

17:16.579 --> 17:18.272
l tell her not to.

17:19.880 --> 17:21.938
l give her three chances.

17:22.749 --> 17:24.181
Then l use the paperweight.

17:24.383 --> 17:25.748
The paperweight?

17:26.084 --> 17:27.242
l put it on the stove.

17:29.352 --> 17:33.447
l didn't mean to hurt her.
l guess l just left it on too long.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.854
lt's not as bad as it sounds.

17:41.026 --> 17:43.255
My mother did the same thing to me.

17:47.830 --> 17:51.264
The doctor's gonna want a plastic
surgeon to see her hand...

17:51.465 --> 17:52.624
...so you need to stay.

17:53.466 --> 17:54.455
All right.

17:58.036 --> 18:01.766
K-L-E-l-N. First name, Roger.
l don't know the street.

18:01.972 --> 18:05.201
l need a $20 taxi voucher
to send Mrs. Von Avery home.

18:05.407 --> 18:07.874
l'm out of vouchers,
but l have petty cash.

18:08.075 --> 18:11.134
When is somebody gonna come
and pick up this bowel?

18:11.344 --> 18:13.004
l don't know, Jer.

18:17.581 --> 18:19.775
-Twenty.
-Thank you.

18:19.982 --> 18:24.178
-Excuse me, could you change a 20?
-Sure.

18:25.652 --> 18:29.609
One, two, three, four, five.
Five is 1 0, 1 5 and 20.

18:29.988 --> 18:32.649
Actually, could l have a 1 0
for two of the fives?

18:35.491 --> 18:36.718
Right there.

18:39.427 --> 18:40.450
Here you are.

18:42.128 --> 18:44.186
You gave me 1 9.

18:44.396 --> 18:48.194
Nineteen? You're an honest man.
You wanna get that?

18:48.832 --> 18:50.128
l got it.

18:50.700 --> 18:54.157
l have ones here. Why don't l
give you a buck. That'll make 20.

18:54.369 --> 18:57.962
You can give me the 20 back
l gave you and that'll make us even.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.631
Thanks, sport.

19:00.939 --> 19:02.929
When did this one come in?

19:03.140 --> 19:05.130
-Couple minutes ago.
-Great.

19:09.377 --> 19:12.209
Patient's 52, with a history
of calcium oxalate stones.

19:12.412 --> 19:15.209
Pyelogram showed a 6mm
kidney stone in the calyx...

19:15.414 --> 19:19.712
...consistent with obstructive uropathy.
Lithotripsy unsuccessful, paged Urology.

19:19.917 --> 19:23.079
Started an lV for hydration,
gave him 5 mg morphine for the pain.

19:23.252 --> 19:24.241
lt ain't working.

19:24.453 --> 19:27.250
Mr. Furst, l'm Dr. Benton.
When did the pain increase?

19:27.455 --> 19:31.321
Been getting worse for two days.
My internist, Dr. Feldman said...

19:31.523 --> 19:33.990
...if it didn't pass today,
get it cut out.

19:34.359 --> 19:37.758
l couldn't agree more.
Let's move him. Get him up there.

19:42.197 --> 19:44.630
-Peter, hold up.
-What?

19:44.831 --> 19:46.423
Where're you taking my patient?

19:46.633 --> 19:49.566
-To O.R. He's got an obstructed stone.
-Wait a minute!

19:49.767 --> 19:51.701
-What?
-l haven't examined him yet.

19:51.901 --> 19:55.233
-l have.
-You're supposed to wait for a consult.

19:55.437 --> 19:57.336
Please let him go.
l'm dying here.

19:57.538 --> 20:00.529
You wanna examine him?
Here. Go ahead, examine him.

20:05.977 --> 20:07.876
Don't pull this crap again.

20:10.413 --> 20:12.937
-This is all so unnecessary.
-Excuse me?

20:13.148 --> 20:15.671
This territorialism.
Friction between departments.

20:15.882 --> 20:19.442
lt's all an outdated, patriarchal
system based on confrontation.

20:19.652 --> 20:23.313
Where he who yells loudest wins,
even though he may be totally wrong.

20:23.520 --> 20:24.714
That's how it is.

20:24.921 --> 20:26.251
lt doesn't have to be.

20:26.455 --> 20:30.913
Picture a hospital without departments.
Where every floor is staffed...

20:31.125 --> 20:32.921
...by a team of specialists.

20:33.126 --> 20:36.617
No time wasted on battles about
''Your service, my service.''

20:36.828 --> 20:39.488
They've been replaced by
a more evolved, harmonious...

20:39.696 --> 20:42.755
...feminine model, in which
the patient belongs to us.

20:43.065 --> 20:44.622
Sounds good. Does it exist?

20:44.832 --> 20:47.129
lt will. l'm building it.

20:48.402 --> 20:50.528
And you are again....?

20:50.736 --> 20:54.898
John Koch. MlT, Sloan School
of Management.

21:01.242 --> 21:05.371
She doesn't wanna wait for the plastic
surgeon. She wants to take her home.

21:05.578 --> 21:07.772
-Where's the social worker?
-l paged her.

21:07.980 --> 21:10.811
-The police?
-Supposed to be on their way.

21:11.315 --> 21:12.975
Okay, follow my lead.

21:15.583 --> 21:17.948
We apologize for the delay.

21:18.152 --> 21:20.881
The plastic surgeon wants
to do more tests on her.

21:21.220 --> 21:23.915
Nurse Hathaway's going to
take her up to Radiology.

21:24.122 --> 21:25.110
Can l go with her?

21:25.423 --> 21:27.447
l'm sorry. Hospital policy.

21:27.657 --> 21:30.056
l wanna stay with my mommy.

21:30.626 --> 21:32.115
lt's okay, sweetheart.
Come on.

21:32.293 --> 21:33.282
l want my mommy!

21:33.494 --> 21:35.654
-l don't want her to go.
-This is her.

21:38.097 --> 21:39.290
Calm down! Get her feet!

21:39.497 --> 21:40.930
Give me back my baby!

21:42.066 --> 21:44.124
You lied, you lying bitch!

21:44.334 --> 21:45.926
You lying bitch!

21:46.135 --> 21:47.897
Please don't take my baby!

21:48.103 --> 21:50.332
All right, people.
Let's get him prepped.

21:50.538 --> 21:52.562
Doc, knock me out, will you?

21:52.772 --> 21:55.399
Just take it easy.
Help is on the way, okay?

21:55.607 --> 21:57.267
All right. Here we go.

22:00.810 --> 22:03.937
-Christ! l haven't put him out yet.
-l didn't cut him.

22:09.549 --> 22:10.845
What's going on?

22:11.149 --> 22:15.243
Folks, we can all scrub out.
The stone hath passed.

22:16.252 --> 22:18.310
Thank God!

22:30.894 --> 22:32.326
How are you feeling?

22:37.298 --> 22:41.733
l saw in your chart that you
used to teach high school English.

22:42.334 --> 22:44.062
Was that here in Chicago?

22:45.869 --> 22:48.860
The hospital has a good library.
l could get some books--

22:49.071 --> 22:51.004
Maybe some Conrad?

22:53.640 --> 22:57.598
l spoke to three Roger Kleins
in the Bloomington area...

22:58.276 --> 23:01.369
...none of them were your son.

23:02.746 --> 23:06.647
The phone company checked the unlisted
numbers. l couldn't find him.

23:07.049 --> 23:08.811
ls there anyone else l can call?

23:11.718 --> 23:14.549
How long has it been since
you spoke to your son?

23:17.421 --> 23:18.945
Ten years.

23:22.324 --> 23:24.120
Twenty years.

23:25.459 --> 23:26.652
l'm sorry.

23:39.134 --> 23:42.068
Excuse me! My fault. You okay?

23:42.269 --> 23:43.394
Yeah, fine.

23:45.771 --> 23:47.931
Six lousy bucks.

23:50.774 --> 23:53.537
-l've got it. Where's the vial?
-Here.

23:56.711 --> 23:58.405
Quick, he's coming.

24:08.017 --> 24:09.143
What?

24:17.689 --> 24:20.054
You people have too much
time on your hands.

24:23.692 --> 24:25.660
You should've heard that little girl.

24:26.060 --> 24:29.324
She cried for 45 minutes.
When the social worker took her...

24:29.530 --> 24:32.498
-...she was still crying.
-She's better off.

24:33.165 --> 24:36.292
-Growing up without a mother?
-Her mother's a monster.

24:36.767 --> 24:41.225
l don't believe that. l think
she was damaged a long time ago.

24:41.737 --> 24:44.864
l hope with therapy she'll
improve so she can get her back.

24:45.071 --> 24:48.267
You're more hopeful
than l am, thank God.

24:50.608 --> 24:53.041
l hear you're fostering Tatiana.

24:54.411 --> 24:56.810
You're gonna dissuade me,
like everybody else?

24:57.012 --> 24:59.809
No. l think it's a
wonderful thing you're doing.

25:00.614 --> 25:04.173
-Really?
-Absolutely. You'd make a great mother.

25:05.050 --> 25:08.950
Got a 1 6-year-old GSW to the neck.
ETA seven minutes.

25:10.587 --> 25:11.678
Thanks.

25:12.955 --> 25:15.787
Please no dead kids today.

25:24.929 --> 25:26.190
How is he?

25:26.663 --> 25:29.597
BP's falling, respiration's down.

25:29.798 --> 25:31.890
l don't think he'll
make it till morning.

25:32.899 --> 25:33.888
Thanks.

25:38.570 --> 25:41.333
l didn't know which you'd like,
so l brought a few.

25:44.639 --> 25:46.800
Not a fan of Melville, l see.

26:11.889 --> 26:14.686
Oh, God. Excuse me for a second.

26:22.128 --> 26:24.254
Did you do the physical
on the leg in 2?

26:24.463 --> 26:27.692
Not yet. l thought l'd spend
some more time with Mr. Klein.

26:27.898 --> 26:32.492
She's been waiting half an hour.
Why are you wasting time on a DNR?

26:32.701 --> 26:35.294
Because he's dying and he has no family.

26:36.103 --> 26:39.367
This is your surgical rotation
not pastoral care.

26:39.571 --> 26:41.698
lt's not your job to become his family.

26:41.906 --> 26:44.703
There's more to patient care
than cutting them open.

26:45.242 --> 26:47.141
And that's what nurses are for.

26:47.676 --> 26:50.508
Do the H and P on the leg pain
and renew everyone's meds.

26:51.845 --> 26:53.869
l've got a drunk to stitch up.

26:55.214 --> 26:56.612
Stitch him up.

26:59.917 --> 27:04.716
lt's interesting how modern medicine
dismantles the rituals of death.

27:04.920 --> 27:07.615
We do everything to make it
routine, a non-event.

27:07.822 --> 27:09.812
People don't die here, they ''code.''

27:10.756 --> 27:12.223
We can do better.

27:24.931 --> 27:28.024
Can't believe l didn't think
of it before. Kenosha!

27:28.233 --> 27:31.258
Kenosha. We can live there,
be a family and commute.

27:31.469 --> 27:32.526
Never been there.

27:32.736 --> 27:35.568
lt's great. lt's right on the lake.
Got great schools.

27:35.771 --> 27:38.933
-Birthplace of Don Ameche.
-Well, there it is.

27:39.673 --> 27:41.503
Here's our next lucky contestant.

27:41.707 --> 27:44.504
Who's this Diane Leeds
who keeps calling you?

27:44.709 --> 27:47.438
Very desirable woman who'll
never go out with me.

27:47.912 --> 27:49.105
Why not?

27:50.246 --> 27:52.577
One of her friends is one of my exes.

27:52.781 --> 27:54.270
Turned you down?

27:54.482 --> 27:56.039
Never bothered asking her out.

27:56.249 --> 27:57.910
You're afraid to ask her out?

27:58.117 --> 28:00.176
Nobody likes rejection.
What do you got?

28:00.386 --> 28:02.250
.38 caliber.
Shot in the neck.

28:02.453 --> 28:06.046
He's bleeding profusely,
BP's 60 over 40.

28:06.222 --> 28:07.211
How did it happen?

28:07.423 --> 28:10.117
He was robbing a store.
Cop shot him.

28:11.125 --> 28:13.115
Turn him over to me.
l got it. Let's go!

28:13.326 --> 28:15.793
-What's his story?
-He's the cop.

28:15.994 --> 28:20.554
Get me a blood on pressure bag, cross
and type for 6 and an intubation tray.

28:21.731 --> 28:23.664
-Bag's dry.
-Hang a liter of saline.

28:23.866 --> 28:26.095
Squeeze it fast, he's bleeding out.

28:26.301 --> 28:28.860
Neck's still bleeding.
Load up on the O-negative.

28:29.069 --> 28:30.092
No breath sounds.

28:30.303 --> 28:32.293
Need to clamp this bleeder.

28:32.637 --> 28:34.695
Where's Benton?
Anybody see Benton?

29:09.858 --> 29:11.155
l'll be back.

29:12.460 --> 29:13.927
-Got the O-neg.
-No pulse.

29:14.128 --> 29:17.493
-Blood Y-tubing.
-Shot in the heart. Thoracotomy tray.

29:17.697 --> 29:18.857
Don't they wear vests?

29:19.065 --> 29:21.691
-They're supposed to.
-l need some help in here!

29:21.899 --> 29:25.129
-Coming. Susan, you got this?
-l got it. Where's Benton?

29:26.301 --> 29:28.030
Blood coming out of his mouth.

29:28.236 --> 29:30.465
-Bullet holes in his chest?
-Tube's in.

29:30.805 --> 29:32.533
No, just the neck.

29:33.406 --> 29:36.931
-Bleeding in his lungs.
-lf l press harder, he'll stroke out.

29:37.141 --> 29:39.404
-What have we got?
-1 6-year-old...

29:39.576 --> 29:41.668
...bullet to the carotid artery,
thready pulse...

29:41.877 --> 29:44.436
-...blood in his lungs.
-What's going on there?

29:44.646 --> 29:48.171
Cop took a bullet into his heart.
Susan's cracking his chest.

29:49.182 --> 29:51.206
Wait a second.
Get somebody else down.

29:51.416 --> 29:53.007
l'm gonna go help Susan.

29:53.918 --> 29:56.317
l need some elbow room.
Scalpel. Thank you.

29:56.519 --> 29:57.610
Lungs are full of blood.

29:57.853 --> 30:00.878
-Suction, right now. Here we go.
-l have a retractor here.

30:02.489 --> 30:03.979
His brain's not getting blood.

30:04.191 --> 30:07.124
He's young. He's got collaterals
to keep him perfused.

30:08.693 --> 30:11.286
Vascular clamp. Right now.
Come on, Carol. Now!

30:11.495 --> 30:12.654
Thank you.

30:13.062 --> 30:14.153
Lungs are clear.

30:14.630 --> 30:18.962
And he is clamped. Move him.
Right now. Get him out!

30:20.867 --> 30:22.163
-Rib spreader.
-Coming up.

30:22.368 --> 30:24.232
l need more O-neg.

30:24.902 --> 30:27.062
Let's see. What do we have in here?

30:27.671 --> 30:32.436
Hole in the ventricle.
Give me suction, 3.0 proline...

30:33.807 --> 30:35.240
...on an atraumatic needle.

30:36.242 --> 30:38.368
Call the O.R.
l might have a save here.

30:38.577 --> 30:42.307
Where is Carter? He's missing
out on a valuable education here.

30:44.114 --> 30:46.411
l'll do a horizontal mattress,
take two bites...

30:46.615 --> 30:49.583
...go under the coronary artery
so l don't obstruct it.

30:49.783 --> 30:52.376
Better do it quick.
His pressure's dropping.

30:54.453 --> 30:57.716
Now listen, boys and girls.
The trick here is to...

30:57.921 --> 30:59.512
...plug up the hole...

31:00.056 --> 31:03.218
...without closing off the artery.

31:07.260 --> 31:09.193
Which is what l've just done.

31:09.962 --> 31:11.861
Pulled it through the ventricle.
l stitched it.

31:12.063 --> 31:14.656
-Who clamped the kid who went up?
-l did.

31:14.998 --> 31:16.658
l'm getting a pulse.

31:16.966 --> 31:21.333
Nice job. Looks like that rest
did you some good. Take him up.

31:29.507 --> 31:31.906
-What a way to end the day.
-Taking off?

31:32.908 --> 31:34.933
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

31:39.513 --> 31:41.412
-l don't believe you.
-Me?

31:41.614 --> 31:44.480
l finished the file on
the guy you attacked last week.

31:44.682 --> 31:47.172
Then l hear about your
quarrel with a woman.

31:47.383 --> 31:49.373
This time l was the attackee.

31:49.551 --> 31:50.540
Are you all right?

31:50.752 --> 31:53.345
Not the first time l've been
clawed by a female.

31:53.554 --> 31:56.078
-You're paying for your bad karma.
-You've no idea.

31:56.289 --> 31:59.950
l don't know what Legal will say
about defending you a second time.

32:00.158 --> 32:02.887
-You defended me the first time?
-That's my job.

32:03.126 --> 32:05.525
l need you to write out
a statement. Again.

32:05.728 --> 32:08.661
And don't take so long
getting it back to me this time.

32:08.929 --> 32:10.089
Listen, Diane.

32:12.165 --> 32:14.724
You wanna get some dinner sometime?

32:15.599 --> 32:17.260
l don't think that's a good idea.

32:23.971 --> 32:25.597
l guess you were right.

32:27.940 --> 32:29.964
l'm right. l'm right.

32:31.509 --> 32:32.770
You got a minute?

32:33.010 --> 32:36.501
-Dr. Greene, Endo on 6.
-l'll take it at the nurse's station.

32:36.713 --> 32:40.044
l wanna make sure bleeding varices
gets presented next week.

32:40.247 --> 32:43.511
-You won't be there?
-No, l'll be in Boston.

32:44.349 --> 32:47.476
l'm taking over the
Residency Program at the Brigham.

32:47.685 --> 32:49.777
Greene here.
Can you hold on? Harvard?

32:49.986 --> 32:51.350
Always an ambition of mine.

32:51.554 --> 32:54.215
-Congratulations.
-Thanks. l couldn't be happier.

32:54.422 --> 32:57.015
l took care of your becoming
an attending next year....

32:57.224 --> 32:59.088
l recommended you to the chief.

32:59.492 --> 33:01.550
You're the guy,
no need to look further.

33:01.860 --> 33:04.657
-Thank you. l appreciate it.
-lt's almost a lock.

33:05.496 --> 33:07.861
The new guy has to
approve it, but don't worry.

33:08.063 --> 33:11.793
l'm in my office another two weeks.
Come by, we'll have a drink.

33:16.168 --> 33:19.625
''Sailing these seas
or on the hills

33:20.237 --> 33:22.102
Or waking in the night

33:22.872 --> 33:26.363
Thoughts, silent thoughts
of Time...

33:26.575 --> 33:29.701
...and Space and Death,
like waters flowing

33:29.909 --> 33:32.968
Bear me indeed as through
the regions infinite

33:33.178 --> 33:35.077
Whose air l breathe

33:35.580 --> 33:39.480
Whose ripples here
lave me all over

33:39.715 --> 33:42.842
Bathe me, O God,
in the mounting to Thee

33:43.051 --> 33:46.780
l in my soul to range--
in range of Thee.

33:53.190 --> 33:56.055
O thou transcendent,
nameless, vibrant....''

34:04.997 --> 34:07.521
Did you do notes on all your patients?

34:07.731 --> 34:09.027
l'm doing them now.

34:09.233 --> 34:13.190
They're supposed to be in by end of
shift. Looks like you've just begun.

34:13.568 --> 34:15.558
sHave them first thing in the morning.

34:16.103 --> 34:17.933
You'll be up all night.

34:19.005 --> 34:22.234
That's what happens when you spend
too much time with one patient.

34:23.373 --> 34:25.637
l consider it time well spent.

34:29.344 --> 34:30.743
He died 1 0 minutes ago.

34:37.149 --> 34:40.208
Why did you put in for
a surgical sub-internship?

34:40.751 --> 34:42.274
l want to be a surgeon.

34:42.485 --> 34:43.815
You're wasting your time.

34:44.920 --> 34:46.887
You don't think like a surgeon.

34:47.321 --> 34:49.413
Why? Because l don't think like you?

34:52.458 --> 34:54.789
l want those notes
first thing in the morning.

35:02.630 --> 35:04.154
Cat. ''C.''

35:04.365 --> 35:07.389
Da. ''C'' is for cat.
And Carol.

35:08.934 --> 35:12.095
Ms. Brown from Family Development
is here for you.

35:22.742 --> 35:26.142
Something came up
in your background check.

35:26.777 --> 35:28.903
You attempted suicide last year.

35:32.314 --> 35:34.508
l wish you'd told us sooner.

35:35.416 --> 35:40.044
l'm afraid we can't place Tatiana with
you. The state will not approve it.

35:40.252 --> 35:42.242
But l'm fully recovered now--

35:42.453 --> 35:45.943
lf it had happened three
years ago, maybe. But one year....

35:46.155 --> 35:48.622
We just can't. l'm sorry.

36:30.914 --> 36:33.211
l'm working on it right now.

36:35.184 --> 36:36.707
How about next Friday?

36:38.886 --> 36:40.352
You're asking me out?

36:40.620 --> 36:43.179
No, l'm responding to
you asking me out.

36:43.622 --> 36:45.145
That was three hours ago.

36:46.691 --> 36:48.123
Change your mind?

36:48.558 --> 36:50.149
No, l don't think so.

36:52.927 --> 36:54.417
So we're on?

36:56.096 --> 36:58.757
lf it means that much to you, okay.

36:59.598 --> 37:02.657
l don't think l like the way
this date is starting out.

37:02.867 --> 37:04.231
lt'll get better.

37:06.269 --> 37:07.758
We'll see.

37:13.073 --> 37:15.131
Hey, my man's on time.

37:17.842 --> 37:19.308
Where's everybody at?

37:19.509 --> 37:23.534
Jackie and the kids went up
to the lake early. Mom went to bed.

37:24.913 --> 37:27.880
She said to remind you that
your mother wakes up early.

37:28.081 --> 37:31.106
Six a.m. She'll be
wanting her medicine.

37:31.316 --> 37:32.612
l'll set the alarm.

37:35.285 --> 37:37.150
You really going out on the ice?

37:37.353 --> 37:41.755
lt's that or spend the day in a three-
room cabin with your sister, the kids...

37:41.956 --> 37:45.685
...and no TV?
Hell, yeah, l'm going out on the ice.

37:48.927 --> 37:50.791
What time you all coming back?

37:50.995 --> 37:55.123
About 8:00 tomorrow night.
Thanks a lot. l really appreciate this.

37:55.297 --> 37:56.286
Yeah, sure.

37:56.464 --> 37:59.159
There's some leftover
meat loaf in the fridge.

38:02.034 --> 38:03.557
Catch me a walleye.

38:03.768 --> 38:06.031
Yeah, right. Later, man.

38:51.796 --> 38:54.559
-Can l?
-Yeah. Come on in.

38:57.633 --> 38:58.621
What is it?

38:58.833 --> 39:00.300
l lost her.

39:01.035 --> 39:03.594
l've been in therapy.
l've worked hard for 9 months.

39:03.803 --> 39:07.135
All they care
about is that l took some pills.

39:07.806 --> 39:08.794
zWho?

39:10.640 --> 39:13.972
-Ms. Brown, Foster Care.
-Tatiana?

39:16.044 --> 39:17.840
They won't let me have her.

39:18.879 --> 39:21.244
lt's like l'm defective or something.

39:28.685 --> 39:33.586
God, l'm kidding myself, that l
could do this. lt's so stupid.

39:34.688 --> 39:35.780
You're ice cold.

39:35.989 --> 39:40.447
You should've seen her. She's seven
years old. l tried to explain it....

39:40.658 --> 39:45.389
Listen to me. lt's not your fault.
You hear me? lt's not your fault.

39:46.094 --> 39:49.028
But l promised her
l'd be there and now l'm not.

39:49.229 --> 39:50.696
How could you have known?

39:57.702 --> 40:01.101
Maybe l shouldn't have thought
about doing this.

40:01.303 --> 40:04.829
No. You were exactly what she needed.

40:08.941 --> 40:11.374
You are the only person who thinks that.

40:12.443 --> 40:13.967
l know you.

40:16.879 --> 40:18.368
Can l stay here?

40:22.916 --> 40:24.348
Has Tag heard yet?

40:25.417 --> 40:27.043
He never wanted her.

40:29.353 --> 40:31.843
-Carol, no.
-Please.

40:37.091 --> 40:38.887
Why don't l drive you home?

40:48.097 --> 40:49.155
l know.

40:53.934 --> 40:57.629
Design's been approved, we've set
a construction date for June...

40:57.836 --> 41:01.771
...and we've recruited world-class
physicians, like Borges and Folkman...

41:01.972 --> 41:03.199
...to our advisory board.

41:03.373 --> 41:04.362
That's impressive.

41:04.540 --> 41:07.666
They know we're onto something.
We're getting resources...

41:07.875 --> 41:11.833
...and l'm approached daily by
exceptional doctors about joining us.

41:13.979 --> 41:16.469
-Are you interested?
-Me?

41:16.680 --> 41:19.477
From what l've seen,
your expertise and temperament...

41:19.682 --> 41:22.343
...auger a very promising
medical career.

41:22.751 --> 41:25.719
l'm flattered.
And yes, l am interested.

41:25.919 --> 41:26.942
Excellent.

41:27.120 --> 41:28.109
There he is.

41:28.287 --> 41:30.277
Marty, we were worried about you.

41:30.489 --> 41:31.853
Why you gotta do this?

41:32.056 --> 41:34.421
-Do l know you people?
-Please be good.

41:34.624 --> 41:36.784
Don't make me use the restraints.

41:36.992 --> 41:38.219
This is almost amusing.

41:38.426 --> 41:41.292
This is a mistake. This is
Dr. Koch from MlT, Sloan--

41:41.495 --> 41:44.156
Sloan School of Management.
lt's his latest thing.

41:44.730 --> 41:47.925
A few months ago, he passed as an OB
and delivered two babies.

41:48.132 --> 41:49.565
He's smart. Reads a lot.

41:49.767 --> 41:51.256
You're saying you're not--

41:51.467 --> 41:53.798
lt'll get sorted out.
lt'll get sorted out.

41:54.002 --> 41:57.731
l just was planning to observe
the Psych Ward anyway. Come on.

41:57.904 --> 41:58.893
Wait.

42:01.040 --> 42:02.472
Come on, Marty.

42:10.879 --> 42:12.675
l didn't expect you.

42:14.847 --> 42:15.836
Where's Rach?

42:16.049 --> 42:19.278
l didn't bring her.
We need to talk.

42:22.886 --> 42:24.614
Yeah, we do.

42:27.655 --> 42:30.020
l can't do this anymore, Mark.

42:30.424 --> 42:32.914
Not living together,
never seeing each other.

42:33.124 --> 42:35.183
l know. So let's stop it.

42:36.260 --> 42:38.124
You'll leave the hospital?

42:38.294 --> 42:42.752
A compromise. We can live between
Chicago and Milwaukee: Kenosha.

42:42.963 --> 42:46.159
lt's just an hour each direction.
We can be a family again.

42:47.167 --> 42:48.963
What? lt can work.

42:49.168 --> 42:51.999
You want me to commute two hours
a day so you can take a job?

42:52.202 --> 42:54.601
So we can all be together again.

42:57.338 --> 42:59.771
That's two hours less for Rachel.

43:00.174 --> 43:02.607
lt's bad enough she's not
growing up with you.

43:03.476 --> 43:07.342
Whose fault is that?
lt was your idea to go to Milwaukee.

43:07.578 --> 43:09.909
Would you rather l leave her
here with you?

43:20.019 --> 43:23.180
ln 7 years, you've never
given anything up for me.

43:23.387 --> 43:27.981
Why are you intent on making me give
up a job l've spent years trying to get?

43:28.190 --> 43:31.784
You do what you want when you want,
and you expect me and Rachel...

43:31.992 --> 43:34.858
...to be there for you
when you have time for us.

43:47.601 --> 43:49.591
Jen, come on.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.303
l don't think we're gonna make it.

43:52.504 --> 43:54.095
We're gonna make it.

43:55.005 --> 43:56.369
No. This isn't working.

43:56.573 --> 43:59.439
We'll make it work.
We went a year, we can go another.

44:01.110 --> 44:04.271
l'll come up more often.
Rachel, she can come down here.

44:04.478 --> 44:07.446
-You're not listening.
-l am. l'm listening.

44:09.747 --> 44:11.043
l'm leaving you.

44:17.952 --> 44:19.442
l'm sorry.

44:37.497 --> 44:38.555
Jackie?

44:40.499 --> 44:42.557
l need my medicine.

44:44.267 --> 44:45.393
Peter?

45:04.746 --> 45:05.734
Mom?!

45:15.385 --> 45:19.184
Dr. Benton's mother, 75 years old.
History of CVA, fell down the stairs.

45:19.388 --> 45:22.844
Possible hip fracture.
BP's 90 over 60, heart rate 1 1 0.

45:23.056 --> 45:26.547
Leg shortened and externally rotated.
l got an lV of saline going.

45:26.759 --> 45:31.217
O-2 by naso-canular, 1 0 liters.
CCS 354, LOC at the scene.

45:31.428 --> 45:34.021
-l've got her lV.
-She's waking up now.

45:36.098 --> 45:37.724
Let's move her.

45:38.466 --> 45:42.924
Careful of her hip. On three.
One, two, three.

45:43.369 --> 45:45.268
Call Radiology, get Neuro down here.

45:45.470 --> 45:48.995
-Check her pupils in response to pain.
-Dr. Benton, what happened?
