00:35.189 --> 00:37.024
All right, Drunken
Clammers, this is it,

00:37.058 --> 00:38.825
the most important
game of the season.

00:38.860 --> 00:41.261
Now, is everybody drunk?
(others react affirmatively)

00:41.295 --> 00:42.729
Completely.
Okay, good.

00:42.764 --> 00:45.532
And did nobody warm up?
(others react affirmatively)

00:45.583 --> 00:48.368
Good. 'Cause there's nothing
an unstretched middle-aged body

00:48.403 --> 00:50.187
likes more than
explosive movements.

00:50.221 --> 00:52.172
Now remember, we're here
to impress the girlfriends

00:52.206 --> 00:53.523
of guys we barely know,

00:53.558 --> 00:55.676
so when you get the ball,
throw it like a cannon.

00:55.710 --> 00:58.028
You must throw your arm out
on every play.

00:58.062 --> 01:00.030
Any other softball-related
questions?

01:00.064 --> 01:01.148
Yeah, I got a question:

01:01.182 --> 01:02.983
Can we leave
our bad-for-the-environment

01:03.017 --> 01:05.352
Styrofoam coolers behind
when we leave?

01:05.385 --> 01:06.687
Yes, you must
leave them behind,

01:06.721 --> 01:08.422
and they must be
in a crumbly mess

01:08.456 --> 01:10.357
so that the city clean-up
workers have to chase

01:10.391 --> 01:12.242
the little bits
when the wind blows.

01:12.276 --> 01:13.827
You know, Stewie, this is
actually a good park.

01:13.861 --> 01:15.712
I've found a lot
of old tennis balls here.

01:15.747 --> 01:17.180
Eh, I don't care
for this place.

01:17.215 --> 01:18.448
Last time I was here,

01:18.483 --> 01:21.084
I accidentally walked
into a Spanish picnic.

01:21.119 --> 01:24.421
Excuse me, has anyone seen
a toy car around here?

01:24.455 --> 01:26.089
Ooh. <i>Es</i> baby.

01:26.124 --> 01:27.841
I make beautiful.

01:27.875 --> 01:29.126
(clippers buzzing)

01:34.565 --> 01:36.933
Don't get any ideas
about Julio.

01:36.968 --> 01:38.935
I'm his number one.

01:38.970 --> 01:41.438
Here comes
Goldman's Pharmacy.

01:43.141 --> 01:44.374
Hey, Goldman's Pharmacy!

01:44.409 --> 01:46.893
Can you fill out a prescription
for us for diarrhea?

01:46.928 --> 01:48.478
We're about to get the runs!

01:48.513 --> 01:50.764
(others laugh)

01:50.798 --> 01:52.365
Oh, yeah?
Well, speaking of things

01:52.400 --> 01:53.867
that are brown and can run,

01:53.901 --> 01:55.802
meet our new teammate!

01:58.172 --> 02:00.157
Holy crap.
They got a ringer.

02:00.191 --> 02:02.159
What the hell?
Jerome's on your team?

02:02.193 --> 02:04.027
That's right.
We got to know each other

02:04.061 --> 02:06.363
while I was following
him around my store.

02:06.397 --> 02:08.365
What's up, fools?
I'd like to dedicate

02:08.399 --> 02:11.268
my performance today
to Miss Whitney Houston.

02:11.302 --> 02:13.303
Oh, we are (bleep).

02:17.341 --> 02:18.308
Come on, Jerome!

02:18.342 --> 02:20.077
Get a hit so I can bring

02:20.111 --> 02:21.845
a sports trophy home
for my parents!

02:21.847 --> 02:24.714
Jeffrey Lipsitz
has two soccerals!ed

02:24.749 --> 02:27.584
I can't play soccer--
I have newborn-calf ankles!

02:27.618 --> 02:29.603
You know this, damn it!

02:30.671 --> 02:32.973
I'm gonna tear the cover
off this ball.

02:33.007 --> 02:36.026
But, hang on, first I got
to adjust myself.

02:41.549 --> 02:43.700
Are you having
a nice morning, dear?

02:43.734 --> 02:47.003
Oh, yes, I love living here,
in the next town over.

02:50.892 --> 02:51.875
All right, chick batter!

02:51.909 --> 02:52.859
Everyone bring it in!

02:52.894 --> 02:53.910
Bring it on in!

02:53.945 --> 02:55.212
Get a hit, babe!

02:55.246 --> 02:57.531
(deep voice):
You know it, babe.

02:57.565 --> 03:00.383
All right, move it back!
Move it back!

03:02.587 --> 03:04.204
Peter, why do you look
so nervous?

03:04.238 --> 03:07.874
I promised a kid in the hospital
I'd hit a home run for him.

03:11.362 --> 03:12.929
Sorry, I struck
out looking.

03:12.964 --> 03:14.931
Wait, you're not
the kid I promised.

03:14.966 --> 03:16.867
No, he died last night.

03:16.901 --> 03:18.552
Oh, phew.

03:22.190 --> 03:24.107
All right, guys, one more out
and the game is ours.

03:24.142 --> 03:25.675
Come on, Horace!
Strike him out!

03:33.284 --> 03:34.067
(crowd gasps)

03:34.101 --> 03:35.685
(gasps)

03:40.641 --> 03:41.858
Horace! You okay?

03:41.892 --> 03:42.909
Oh, my God!
He's really hurt bad!

03:42.944 --> 03:44.127
You're out of the baseline,
by the way.

03:44.162 --> 03:45.245
You're out. Game's over.

03:45.279 --> 03:47.514
But, oh, my God,
Horace is really hurt.

03:48.599 --> 03:50.033
He's dead.

03:50.067 --> 03:51.735
(all gasp, murmur)

03:51.769 --> 03:54.204
Let him rest in peace.

03:56.307 --> 03:58.391
(sighs) Let's put
some leaves on him

03:58.426 --> 04:00.260
and go get some ice cream.

04:06.734 --> 04:08.702
I can't believe Horace is dead.

04:08.736 --> 04:12.272
I can't believe we left Brian
in the car with the windows up.

04:13.307 --> 04:15.275
I'm gonna pee!

04:15.309 --> 04:17.944
Listen, I just
feel awful about this.

04:17.978 --> 04:20.480
Horace was a good bartender
and a good guy.

04:20.514 --> 04:22.499
I wish there was something
I could do.

04:22.533 --> 04:24.467
Well, we know you
didn't mean it, Jerome.

04:24.502 --> 04:26.069
It's just a
terrible situation.

04:26.103 --> 04:28.021
Like when you're the
only one at the table

04:28.055 --> 04:29.956
where the waiter doesn't
say, "Good order."

04:29.991 --> 04:32.292
I'll have the halibut.
Ah, great choice.

04:32.326 --> 04:34.461
One of the chef's specialties;
you'll love it.

04:34.495 --> 04:36.963
It was caught fresh less
than ten miles from here.

04:36.998 --> 04:38.632
I'll have the New York
strip steak.

04:38.666 --> 04:40.700
Mmm! My absolute
favorite dish here.

04:40.735 --> 04:43.370
It is a spectacular cut,
superbly seasoned

04:43.404 --> 04:46.206
and the marbling is some
of the best I've ever seen.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.474
And I'll have
the chicken.

04:47.508 --> 04:49.009
Mm-hmm.

04:50.711 --> 04:52.178
Good afternoon.

04:52.213 --> 04:53.847
I'd just like to say that...

04:53.881 --> 04:56.683
before today, I didn't know
the Munsters were driving around

04:56.717 --> 04:58.184
in a funeral car.

04:58.219 --> 05:00.587
I'm beginning to think
everything on that show

05:00.621 --> 05:02.622
was a big joke.

05:04.225 --> 05:06.192
(inhales deeply)

05:06.227 --> 05:09.362
(voice quavering):
I'd, um... I'd just like...

05:09.397 --> 05:11.731
(gasps)

05:11.766 --> 05:13.767
Whe... When you lose...

05:13.801 --> 05:15.702
(stifled sobs)

05:15.736 --> 05:17.704
(sniffles, exhales)

05:17.738 --> 05:20.840
(high-pitched): Um, there's
so... There's so mu...

05:20.875 --> 05:23.576
(exhales)
There's so much...

05:23.611 --> 05:26.997
(grunts)

05:27.031 --> 05:30.000
I... I...

05:30.034 --> 05:31.668
(sobbing)

05:31.686 --> 05:33.336
Thank you, Quagmire.

05:33.371 --> 05:36.973
Perhaps there are some <i>men</i> who
would like to say a few words.

05:37.008 --> 05:39.976
Horace owned the Clam
for over 30 years.

05:40.011 --> 05:42.946
During that time,
he touched all of our lives.

05:42.980 --> 05:45.615
He was a great bartender
and a great friend.

05:45.650 --> 05:48.134
And so let us take
a look back on his life

05:48.169 --> 05:51.020
through this video
commemorating all the DUI's

05:51.038 --> 05:53.406
that he was responsible for.

05:56.177 --> 06:03.216
♪ I will remember you

06:03.250 --> 06:09.506
♪ Will you remember me?

06:09.540 --> 06:13.226
♪ Don't let your life

06:13.260 --> 06:15.595
♪ Pass you by

06:15.646 --> 06:17.731
E.T.:
Ouch.

06:17.765 --> 06:19.899
Is there a bathroom in here?

06:19.934 --> 06:23.486
I've been yo-yoing a turd
for the last 20 minutes.

06:29.260 --> 06:30.160
(gasps)
Oh, sorry.

06:30.194 --> 06:31.561
I was looking
for the bathroom.

06:31.595 --> 06:33.396
I shouldn't have left
the door open.

06:33.431 --> 06:35.131
Sorry if you're grossed out
by this.

06:35.166 --> 06:36.566
No. No, no, I'm just...

06:36.600 --> 06:40.370
not used to seeing corpses
that big and not in a toilet.

06:40.404 --> 06:42.539
Oh, here, let me
help you with that.

06:42.573 --> 06:44.541
(grunts)

06:44.575 --> 06:45.925
There you go.

06:45.960 --> 06:47.844
Now you're all set
for your big day.

06:47.878 --> 06:50.997
Thanks. You know, I could use
some part-time help here

06:51.032 --> 06:52.832
preparing the bodies,
if you're interested.

06:52.867 --> 06:54.834
Really? Yeah,
that'd-that'd be great.

06:54.869 --> 06:56.069
I could use the money,

06:56.103 --> 06:58.421
and I'm getting kind of
tired of my old job.

06:58.456 --> 07:01.057
ANNOUNCER: Only a half a point divides
our top two competitors

07:01.092 --> 07:03.960
as we enter the last event,
the Meg Roll.

07:07.431 --> 07:08.982
You think it's cool
to go drinking

07:09.033 --> 07:10.200
right after Horace's funeral?

07:10.234 --> 07:12.369
Of course. It's what
he would've wanted.

07:12.403 --> 07:13.953
Listen, we all
got to move on.

07:13.988 --> 07:17.957
Like the Secret Service did
on November 23, 1963.

07:17.992 --> 07:19.809
All right, guys,
I know that yesterday

07:19.844 --> 07:21.144
was a rough one for us.

07:21.178 --> 07:22.445
But it's with great pride

07:22.480 --> 07:25.048
that I'm gonna turn this zero
into a one.

07:25.082 --> 07:26.249
All right!

07:26.283 --> 07:28.334
Nichols, you should
go home and change.

07:30.638 --> 07:32.038
What the hell?
Hey, pal, what're you doing?

07:32.073 --> 07:33.039
This is our bar.

07:33.074 --> 07:34.140
Not anymore.

07:34.175 --> 07:35.975
Horace owed more
than this place is worth,

07:36.010 --> 07:37.510
so it's the bank's now.

07:37.545 --> 07:40.513
I'm sorry but The Drunken Clam
is permanently closed.

07:40.548 --> 07:41.815
Closed?!

07:41.849 --> 07:43.817
PETER: <i>That was the start</i>
<i>of the dark times.</i>

07:43.851 --> 07:47.604
<i>The banks took our bars, our</i>
<i>businesses and then our homes.</i>

07:47.638 --> 07:49.105
<i>A change had to be made.</i>

07:49.139 --> 07:51.608
<i>A change only one man</i>
<i>could make.</i>

07:51.642 --> 07:53.626
<i>I am the Wind Maker...</i>

07:54.628 --> 07:56.496
<i>...and I shoot monkeys now.</i>

08:02.960 --> 08:06.296
ANNOUNCER: <i>We now return</i>
<i>to</i> Joanie Loves Chris Brown.

08:06.330 --> 08:07.297
(indistinct chatter)

08:07.331 --> 08:08.965
Joanie! Chris!

08:09.000 --> 08:11.518
Welcome to the party.
Can I offer you some punch?

08:11.552 --> 08:13.853
No, thanks. I had
some in the car.

08:13.888 --> 08:15.889
ANNOUNCER: Joanie Loves
Chris Brown <i>was taped in front</i>

08:15.923 --> 08:18.124
<i>of a very uncomfortable</i>
<i>studio audience.</i>

08:18.159 --> 08:20.627
Man, it really sucks
they closed down the Clam.

08:20.661 --> 08:22.195
Yeah, but I... I mean,
this is good, right?

08:22.229 --> 08:24.614
I mean, as long as we got a
place to drink and a restroom

08:24.649 --> 08:26.950
for businessmen to have
homosexual encounters.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.335
Hey, thanks for the sex.

08:28.369 --> 08:31.371
Thank you for notarizing
those documents.

08:31.422 --> 08:33.390
Peter, what's
going on down here?

08:33.424 --> 08:35.491
Why are there beer bottles
all over the floor?

08:35.525 --> 08:37.559
Well, we needed a new spot
to drink, Lois.

08:37.595 --> 08:38.979
Forget it, Peter.

08:39.013 --> 08:40.547
You're not turning our
living room into a bar.

08:40.581 --> 08:42.899
Oh, come on, Lois, we got
to have a place to drink.

08:42.933 --> 08:44.049
Drinking is the only thing

08:44.085 --> 08:45.185
holding this friendship
together.

08:45.219 --> 08:48.054
Everything we try to do sober
just ends badly.

08:48.089 --> 08:51.057
I just don't think a good way
to start a screenplay is,

08:51.092 --> 08:53.727
"400 years ago
in Bethesda, Maryland."

08:53.761 --> 08:55.962
Yeah, and don't you think it's
confusing that every character

08:55.997 --> 08:58.481
in the movie is named Movie Guy?
Come on, you guys.

08:58.516 --> 09:00.800
The Oscars are next week,
so let's get this done.

09:05.706 --> 09:08.274
Meg, I'm needed upstairs,
so I'll let you finish up.

09:08.309 --> 09:10.010
Just put some blush
here and here.

09:10.044 --> 09:13.363
It makes the eyes look
a little less dead and hollow.

09:13.381 --> 09:15.181
Wow, that really works.

09:15.216 --> 09:17.584
Hmm. Maybe I'll try
that on myself.

09:17.618 --> 09:21.955
Oh, uh... you have what we call
a "closed casket face."

09:23.240 --> 09:25.141
Hey, Meg,
who's your date?

09:25.176 --> 09:27.610
He looks like a real stiff.
(laughs)

09:27.645 --> 09:29.679
Chris, what the hell
are you doing here?

09:29.714 --> 09:31.681
I told you not to
bother me at work.

09:31.716 --> 09:34.317
I got locked out of the house,
and I need your key.

09:34.352 --> 09:38.321
No way! You get to work
with all these dead people?

09:38.356 --> 09:40.690
Hey, look,
this guy's picking his nose.

09:40.725 --> 09:41.925
(laughs)

09:41.959 --> 09:43.276
Look, now he's eating it!

09:43.327 --> 09:44.644
Chris! Knock it off!

09:44.678 --> 09:46.413
You're gonna get me
in trouble!

09:46.447 --> 09:47.731
Meg, they're dead.

09:47.765 --> 09:49.566
Would you stop being so uptight?

09:49.600 --> 09:51.301
You're like one
of those Asian-Americans

09:51.335 --> 09:52.969
who fought in Vietnam.

09:53.003 --> 09:54.304
(shouts)

09:54.338 --> 09:56.306
Oh, it's just me.

09:59.977 --> 10:02.095
Peter, I thought you were taking
us to a new drinking spot.

10:02.129 --> 10:03.797
What are we doing at the Clam?
Look, guys,

10:03.831 --> 10:06.249
we tried other bars,
we tried drinking at home,

10:06.283 --> 10:07.817
we even tried the big
end-of-the-year

10:07.852 --> 10:10.220
high school party
that will change everything.

10:10.254 --> 10:11.888
If we don't lose our
virginity tonight,

10:11.922 --> 10:13.556
we're never gonna
make it in college!

10:13.591 --> 10:14.991
Hey, where's Peter?

10:15.025 --> 10:18.244
Only talking to Amanda Small,
the hottest girl in school.

10:18.279 --> 10:20.413
But aren't you going out
with Joanne Fuller?

10:20.448 --> 10:23.349
JoJo? No, she's my neighbor.
I've known her forever.

10:23.384 --> 10:24.918
She works at her dad's garage.

10:24.952 --> 10:26.419
She's practically a guy.

10:26.454 --> 10:28.655
(gasps)
JoJo?!

10:28.689 --> 10:31.491
♪ Looking from
a window above... ♪

10:31.542 --> 10:33.009
Hi, Peter.

10:33.043 --> 10:35.945
But I thought you was workin'
on your garbage sculpture.

10:35.980 --> 10:38.681
There was someone
I had to see first.

10:38.716 --> 10:41.017
Sorry, Amanda.
By the law of '80s movies,

10:41.051 --> 10:42.786
a newly transformed tomboy

10:42.820 --> 10:45.455
supersedes your
long-standing hotness.

10:46.440 --> 10:50.410
♪ And all I ever knew

10:50.444 --> 10:52.145
♪ Only you...

10:52.179 --> 10:54.180
♪

10:56.283 --> 10:58.585
Let's face it-- there's only
one drinking spot for us,

10:58.619 --> 11:00.453
and it's the Clam.
But, Peter, it's closed.

11:00.488 --> 11:01.654
We can't go in there.

11:01.689 --> 11:03.369
Quagmire, when a girl
says she doesn't want

11:03.390 --> 11:05.909
to have sex with you,
do you take that as an answer?

11:07.144 --> 11:09.829
My lawyer has advised me
not to answer that question.

11:09.864 --> 11:12.198
Look, I bet you could squeeze
through that window.

11:12.967 --> 11:14.100
(garbage can clatters)

11:14.135 --> 11:15.235
(window creaks)

11:15.269 --> 11:16.369
It's not even locked.

11:16.403 --> 11:18.204
And all the booze
is still in there.

11:18.239 --> 11:19.906
Come on, guys,
this is trespassing

11:19.940 --> 11:21.174
and it's against the law.

11:21.208 --> 11:23.109
Maybe we should
just let the Clam go

11:23.144 --> 11:24.544
and, I don't know,
spend more time

11:24.578 --> 11:25.545
with our families.

11:25.579 --> 11:26.546
Yeah, I tried that.

11:26.580 --> 11:28.148
I just spend most of the time

11:28.182 --> 11:30.150
testing Chris to see
if he's autistic.

11:32.086 --> 11:33.052
(screams):
No!

11:33.103 --> 11:34.387
(groaning, whimpering)

11:34.438 --> 11:36.673
Not overly affectionate.

11:36.707 --> 11:39.075
Guys, this is where we belong.

11:39.109 --> 11:40.844
Yeah, no question
about that.

11:40.878 --> 11:42.011
Yeah, we got roots here.

11:42.046 --> 11:44.013
We've been coming
to this place for 15 years.

11:44.048 --> 11:45.598
Our roots go back
further than that.

11:45.633 --> 11:47.100
My grandfather
used to bring me here

11:47.134 --> 11:48.268
when I was a kid.

11:48.302 --> 11:50.136
And his grandfather
brought him here.

11:54.925 --> 11:56.559
Good day, gentlemen!

11:56.594 --> 11:57.877
Welcome to the Drunken Clam!

11:57.912 --> 11:59.913
Can I get you boys
a mug of stout?

11:59.947 --> 12:01.147
Why, certainly.

12:01.182 --> 12:02.749
This is a bully establishment
you've got here.

12:02.783 --> 12:03.943
The doors are a little short,

12:03.968 --> 12:04.934
but that's okay,

12:04.969 --> 12:07.036
because we're smaller back now.

12:08.756 --> 12:09.756
To the Clam!

12:09.807 --> 12:11.040
ALL:
Hear, hear!

12:11.075 --> 12:13.877
And to brain-damaging
venereal disease.

12:13.911 --> 12:15.962
I wake up with blood
on my penis pillow.

12:15.996 --> 12:16.963
I'm gonna go insane

12:16.997 --> 12:19.232
in a wheelchair,
staring at the sea.

12:22.236 --> 12:24.337
(slurring):
This is everything about..

12:24.371 --> 12:25.772
if it's the Clam, I love it.

12:25.806 --> 12:26.940
(sighs)

12:26.974 --> 12:28.541
(slurring): I was just
gonna... that's exactly.

12:28.576 --> 12:30.343
Hey, uh, remember...
remember-remember when...

12:30.377 --> 12:34.314
remember when... remember
when Quicktime here

12:34.348 --> 12:36.432
passed out in this...
in this booth...

12:36.467 --> 12:38.501
this booth,
and we did stuff to him

12:38.536 --> 12:41.454
that you do to ladies
and we-we promised

12:41.488 --> 12:42.722
we'd never tell you.

12:42.756 --> 12:43.890
Wha...?

12:43.924 --> 12:45.291
To the Clam!

12:45.326 --> 12:49.746
Joe, you-- wha...
your hair looks stupid.

12:49.780 --> 12:51.347
All... all the greatest...

12:51.382 --> 12:53.116
all the greatest
moments of my life,

12:53.150 --> 12:55.952
I spent right here
in-in this booth.

12:55.986 --> 12:57.554
Maggie's first word.

12:57.588 --> 12:59.656
Bart jumping that canyon.

12:59.690 --> 13:00.790
Mr. Plow.

13:00.824 --> 13:03.026
All the greatest
moments of my life.

13:03.060 --> 13:04.978
Why is... why is Label Guy

13:05.012 --> 13:06.779
trying to punch me?

13:06.814 --> 13:09.916
(grumbles)
Punch you first, Label Guy.

13:09.950 --> 13:11.100
I got to go pee.

13:11.135 --> 13:12.936
(mumbles):
I don't want to get up.

13:12.970 --> 13:14.470
Joe, where's the... that thing?

13:14.505 --> 13:16.406
Where's the thing?
Where's the catheter thing?

13:16.440 --> 13:17.874
No, it's mine,
it's private.

13:17.908 --> 13:20.243
Hey, what happens
if I blow in this end?

13:20.277 --> 13:21.611
Don't, I'll 'splode.

13:21.645 --> 13:23.513
I'm gonna.

13:25.316 --> 13:28.084
You do it better
than Bonnie.

13:28.118 --> 13:31.471
It takes a man
to know what a man likes.

13:35.843 --> 13:37.810
Meg, the Dougan family
called and they now want

13:37.845 --> 13:40.113
Mr. Dougan in a gray suit
for the wake tomorrow.

13:40.147 --> 13:41.547
'Cause it <i>so</i> matters.

13:41.582 --> 13:43.016
Could you change
his suit, please?

13:43.050 --> 13:45.985
Sure.
I'll be back in a bit.

13:47.271 --> 13:48.237
(casket lid creaks)

13:48.272 --> 13:51.541
Oh... my... God!

13:51.575 --> 13:53.509
All right, Chris,
where is it?

13:53.544 --> 13:55.178
And don't try to act like

13:55.212 --> 13:56.779
you don't know what
I'm talking about.

13:56.814 --> 13:58.448
Fine, you caught me.

13:58.482 --> 14:00.249
So I borrowed your bra.

14:00.267 --> 14:02.802
My boobs hurt when I
go down the stairs!

14:02.836 --> 14:04.203
No, not that, you idiot.

14:04.238 --> 14:05.738
Where is the dead body?

14:05.773 --> 14:07.273
I know you took it.

14:07.308 --> 14:09.142
And don't lie, or I'll
tell Jennifer Connelly

14:09.176 --> 14:10.816
that you're the one
who's been mailing her

14:10.844 --> 14:11.911
those dog heads.

14:11.945 --> 14:15.214
Uh, yes, I'd like
to mail this to a whore.

14:15.249 --> 14:16.849
Okay, fine, Meg!

14:16.884 --> 14:19.152
I used the body to get me
into R-rated movies.

14:19.186 --> 14:20.553
After that,
I took him swimming

14:20.587 --> 14:21.854
and he fell apart.

14:21.889 --> 14:24.123
Chris, Mr. Dougan's
wake is tomorrow,

14:24.158 --> 14:26.859
and there's going to be
a body in that casket.

14:26.894 --> 14:29.262
If it's not his,
it's going to be yours.

14:29.296 --> 14:31.114
Hey, guys,
what's goin' on?

14:31.148 --> 14:32.715
And no one says anything,

14:32.750 --> 14:35.201
which means they hate it.

14:39.490 --> 14:42.091
Oh, God.

14:42.126 --> 14:44.093
I am so hung over.

14:44.128 --> 14:45.261
(groans):
Me, too.

14:45.295 --> 14:46.829
But luckily,
when I'm hung over,

14:46.864 --> 14:48.765
I can just molt
into another Peter.

14:48.799 --> 14:51.834
(grunting)

14:51.869 --> 14:53.369
Wow, that's amazing.

14:53.404 --> 14:54.871
Yeah, but for the next
ten minutes,

14:54.905 --> 14:56.539
I'll be very vulnerable
to predators.

14:56.573 --> 14:57.540
(growling)

14:57.574 --> 14:58.541
(gasps)
Mountain lion.

14:58.575 --> 14:59.742
Make yourself look big!

14:59.777 --> 15:01.477
(growls)

15:03.347 --> 15:04.447
(engines rumbling)

15:04.481 --> 15:05.481
What the hell?

15:07.117 --> 15:08.985
There's a bunch
of bulldozers out there.

15:09.019 --> 15:11.003
(engines rumbling)

15:14.742 --> 15:16.626
Hold it, hold it!
What-what's going on?

15:16.660 --> 15:18.010
We're here to
demolish this building

15:18.045 --> 15:19.645
by order of the bank.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.013
Like hell you are!

15:21.048 --> 15:23.649
Wh-What are you
talking about, Peter?

15:23.684 --> 15:25.518
We ain't goin' nowhere.

15:25.552 --> 15:27.503
This bar belongs to us.

15:27.538 --> 15:29.305
(ice cream truck chiming)

15:29.339 --> 15:31.407
(gasps)
Ice cream truck!

15:33.177 --> 15:34.610
You didn't get any ice cream?

15:34.645 --> 15:36.312
The ice cream man
was handsome.

15:36.346 --> 15:37.613
I got nervous.

15:39.000 --> 15:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:46.719 --> 15:47.869
We interrupt this program

15:47.904 --> 15:50.005
for a Channel Five
breaking news report.

15:50.039 --> 15:52.641
Three local men
have barricaded themselves

15:52.675 --> 15:54.443
inside a Quahog bar,
and are currently

15:54.477 --> 15:56.111
in a standoff with authorities.

15:56.145 --> 15:57.846
We now go live to Joyce Kinney,

15:57.880 --> 16:00.215
who attended her sister's
wedding last night.

16:00.249 --> 16:01.216
Thanks, Tom.

16:01.250 --> 16:02.384
One of the suspects has been

16:02.418 --> 16:04.119
identified as Peter Griffin.

16:04.153 --> 16:05.454
But the real story is,

16:05.488 --> 16:06.638
I'd be married, too,

16:06.656 --> 16:08.607
if I were willing
to date a Persian.

16:08.641 --> 16:09.875
Guys, they found him.

16:09.909 --> 16:11.293
Don't bother
with the posters.

16:11.327 --> 16:12.828
My God,
what is Peter thinking?!

16:12.862 --> 16:15.197
Yes, he's crazy as
a serial killer.

16:15.231 --> 16:17.599
All right, what do you
want for your last meal?

16:17.633 --> 16:19.735
Uh, I think I'll
just have a salad.

16:19.769 --> 16:20.802
Dressing on the side.

16:20.837 --> 16:23.138
I had a <i>huge</i> last lunch.

16:26.309 --> 16:27.893
All right, listen up in there!

16:27.927 --> 16:30.495
Let's not make this
any harder than it has to be.

16:30.513 --> 16:32.547
We have a lot of dumb cops here.

16:32.582 --> 16:33.699
Guys, this is crazy.

16:33.733 --> 16:34.633
Plus, I'm a cop.

16:34.667 --> 16:36.068
I can't be a part of this.

16:36.102 --> 16:37.886
Come on, Joe, this is our bar.

16:37.920 --> 16:40.122
It's where the three of us
made that suicide pact

16:40.156 --> 16:42.791
that Quagmire and I are gonna
back out of at the last minute.

16:42.825 --> 16:44.960
I'm sorry, guys,
but it's my job.

16:44.994 --> 16:47.396
I got a family to support.

16:47.447 --> 16:48.447
That jerk!

16:48.481 --> 16:49.614
How could he desert us?

16:49.649 --> 16:51.416
Relax, Quagmire,
he's just doing his job.

16:51.451 --> 16:52.684
You'll forgive him.

16:52.719 --> 16:54.953
Just like Kathleen Turner
forgave her mirror.

16:54.987 --> 16:55.987
Sorry.

16:56.022 --> 16:58.156
Turns out you were
right about me.

17:00.560 --> 17:01.793
LOIS:
Officer, wait!

17:01.828 --> 17:04.529
I'm his wife;
give me that bullhorn.

17:04.564 --> 17:06.464
Peter, you get out here
right now,

17:06.499 --> 17:08.066
or else I'm throwing away

17:08.101 --> 17:11.169
all of your
Mr. Potato Heads, I swear.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.872
It's okay, she only knows
where the decoys are.

17:13.906 --> 17:15.824
Swanson, there you are.

17:15.858 --> 17:17.675
Listen, you hang out
at this dump.

17:17.710 --> 17:19.961
I want you to go in there
and end this thing.

17:19.996 --> 17:21.262
I'll do my best, sir.

17:26.218 --> 17:27.602
PETER:
<i>This is our bar.</i>

17:27.653 --> 17:30.071
<i>It's the cornerstone</i>
<i>of our friendship.</i>

17:30.106 --> 17:31.656
TIM GUNN:
<i>Joe, this is Tim Gunn.</i>

17:31.691 --> 17:33.158
<i>I agree with your friend.</i>

17:33.192 --> 17:36.144
I got to get that guy
out of my head.

17:36.179 --> 17:38.113
Look, they're sending Joe in.

17:38.147 --> 17:40.499
All right, listen up, fellas.

17:40.533 --> 17:42.768
Joe, wait, put your gun down.

17:42.802 --> 17:44.870
There's no point
in fighting anymore.

17:44.904 --> 17:46.838
We'll leave quietly.

17:46.873 --> 17:48.340
Like hell you will.

17:48.374 --> 17:49.608
This is our Clam,

17:49.642 --> 17:52.544
and we are <i>not</i>
gonna let them take it.

17:52.578 --> 17:55.046
Yay! All right!
All right! Yeah!

17:56.048 --> 17:58.066
We love Joe!

17:58.100 --> 18:00.786
Swanson, what the hell's
going on in here?

18:00.820 --> 18:02.070
I'm sorry, Chief.

18:02.104 --> 18:04.573
I just can't let them
bulldoze this building.

18:04.607 --> 18:06.208
Hey, Joe, is this
the same chief

18:06.242 --> 18:07.843
whose wife is a real hog?

18:07.877 --> 18:09.344
Swanson, don't be a fool.

18:09.378 --> 18:11.713
You really want to throw away
your career on this?

18:11.747 --> 18:13.482
Guys, your bar is gone.

18:13.516 --> 18:14.983
And since
it's bank property,

18:15.017 --> 18:18.270
I have no choice but to place
you all under arrest.

18:18.304 --> 18:20.739
JEROME: It ain't
bank property no more.

18:23.476 --> 18:25.510
Jerome?!
What are you doing here?

18:25.545 --> 18:27.212
Listen, it's kind of
all my fault

18:27.246 --> 18:28.680
this happened
in the first place.

18:28.714 --> 18:31.183
I'm responsible
for Horace's death.

18:31.217 --> 18:33.385
Plus, as a former athlete,
it's my responsibility

18:33.419 --> 18:36.822
to invest my earnings
in a restaurant, bar,

18:36.856 --> 18:37.989
or car dealership.

18:38.024 --> 18:39.324
What sport did you play?

18:39.358 --> 18:40.325
Lacrosse.

18:40.359 --> 18:42.360
Which is also
my brother's name.

18:42.395 --> 18:44.496
Look, I felt bad
about what I did to Horace.

18:44.530 --> 18:46.264
So, when I heard on the news

18:46.299 --> 18:47.732
that they were tearing down
his bar,

18:47.767 --> 18:51.036
I saw buying it as a way
to carry on Horace's legacy.

18:51.070 --> 18:53.471
So I own the Clam now.

18:53.506 --> 18:55.574
Chief, you can call
off your cops.

18:55.608 --> 18:58.476
And you can send those
bulldozers home.

18:58.511 --> 19:00.145
Yay, the Clam is saved!

19:00.179 --> 19:02.013
(cheering)
Yeah! All right.

19:02.048 --> 19:03.281
We pulled it off, guys.

19:03.316 --> 19:04.599
Oh, thank God.

19:04.634 --> 19:06.501
And all because
I believed in myself

19:06.536 --> 19:08.537
like Pop-Pop always said.

19:08.588 --> 19:10.622
Please give me rat poison,

19:10.656 --> 19:12.624
I want only to die.

19:12.658 --> 19:15.644
No, we did it, Pop-Pop.

19:18.848 --> 19:20.599
Meg, the family is here

19:20.633 --> 19:21.783
for Mr. Dougan's wake,

19:21.817 --> 19:24.169
so could you please
bring in the body?

19:24.203 --> 19:26.338
Meg, I'm not doing this.

19:26.372 --> 19:27.505
You have to, Chris.

19:27.540 --> 19:29.591
Siblings have to look
out for each other.

19:29.625 --> 19:30.959
Like the Mannings.

19:30.993 --> 19:33.428
Eli, you threw
for three touchdowns today,

19:33.462 --> 19:36.164
which isn't bad,
except Peyton had four.

19:36.198 --> 19:38.800
Well, Cooper got pre-approved
for a Visa card today.

19:38.834 --> 19:41.469
Come on, guys,
we all had a good day.

19:46.175 --> 19:47.475
Stop it.

19:47.510 --> 19:48.777
I have an itch.

19:48.811 --> 19:50.245
I don't care.

19:50.279 --> 19:52.080
Dead people don't
scratch their balls.

19:52.114 --> 19:53.331
Well, I can't help it.

19:53.366 --> 19:54.866
It's these damn wool pants.

19:54.901 --> 19:56.217
I'm going bananas.

19:56.252 --> 19:58.420
If I can't scratch them,
you have to.

19:58.454 --> 20:00.088
Shh!

20:02.558 --> 20:05.293
Just, uh, straightening out
his pants a little.

20:05.328 --> 20:07.562
CHRIS: Oh, yeah...
yeah, that's good.

20:07.597 --> 20:09.564
Scratch it. Scratch it.

20:09.599 --> 20:11.533
Oh, thank you.

20:11.567 --> 20:14.269
Hello, I'm Helen Dougan.

20:14.303 --> 20:16.388
My husband had filled out
an organ donor card

20:16.422 --> 20:17.589
before he passed away,

20:17.623 --> 20:21.326
and a woman just lost
her face in a freak accident.

20:24.830 --> 20:28.833
Meg, though you cannot tell,
I am frowning.

20:32.204 --> 20:33.872
Wow, Jerome, the
place looks great.

20:33.906 --> 20:35.907
Yeah, look at you,
owning a bar.

20:35.942 --> 20:37.542
You guys are doing
pretty good.

20:37.576 --> 20:39.477
First you get to run
Somalia, now this.

20:39.512 --> 20:40.612
Well, it sure is good

20:40.646 --> 20:42.180
to be back in the old Clam.

20:42.214 --> 20:44.516
Hey, there's some guys
sitting in our booth.

20:46.118 --> 20:48.119
Maybe we should tell them
it's our booth.

20:48.154 --> 20:50.523
Uh-huh. Or we could
just sit on the floor,

20:50.548 --> 20:51.838
next to these garbage cans.
