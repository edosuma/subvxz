WEBVTT

00:03.708 --> 00:07.000
Welcome
to Paris, mademoiselle.

00:07.000 --> 00:10.458
Would you like some bubbly
water with a wedge of lemon?

00:10.458 --> 00:12.750
Oh, Justin, it's
all so beautiful.

00:12.750 --> 00:14.583
The music, the food.

00:14.583 --> 00:17.333
Whatever that last thing
you just said was.

00:17.333 --> 00:19.458
Well, the fake French accent

00:19.458 --> 00:21.333
goes with the fake
French scenery.

00:21.333 --> 00:24.083
I got it from a travel agency
that went out of business.

00:24.083 --> 00:26.250
It was either this or
a volcano in Hawaii,

00:26.250 --> 00:29.458
and volcano food
is always burnt.

00:30.583 --> 00:33.375
So, you recycled?
That's good.

00:33.375 --> 00:35.000
Yeah, well, it's true.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.375
When you hang around angels,

00:36.375 --> 00:39.000
you're influenced
to do good things.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.083
And sometimes we do it
by sending mind messages.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.500
I like you.

00:43.500 --> 00:45.625
I heard it!

00:45.625 --> 00:47.958
Oh my gosh, it was
all echoey in my head.

00:47.958 --> 00:50.958
Like, "I like you, you, you."

00:50.958 --> 00:57.000
Aww. I like you too...
too, too, too.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.291
This is the best date ever.
Put some...

00:59.291 --> 01:00.625
Get out here, Max!

01:00.625 --> 01:03.708
I told you I don't want
all that sand in the house!

01:03.708 --> 01:06.083
Mom! I'm trying to have
a romantic dinner.

01:06.083 --> 01:09.000
Oh! You made it
look like Paris!

01:09.000 --> 01:11.375
And you must be Rosie.

01:11.375 --> 01:16.250
Jerry! Get out here.
Look what Justin did
for his girlfriend.

01:16.250 --> 01:19.500
Why are you
wearing all that stuff?

01:19.500 --> 01:21.583
I am not making two trips!

01:22.750 --> 01:25.000
You people think I'm
the family pack mule!

01:26.583 --> 01:28.750
Oh, hi.

01:28.750 --> 01:31.708
Could this date
get any worse?

01:31.708 --> 01:33.708
Can you hear me, Harper?

01:35.333 --> 01:38.458
Yes. No, I'm on
the terrace now.

01:38.458 --> 01:41.875
Forget the phone,
I can hear better when you yell!

01:45.708 --> 01:48.750
Ah! That's hot.
What was that?

01:48.750 --> 01:52.083
Ow! That's hot.
What was that?

01:53.125 --> 01:56.125
Sorry. Hey, my dad
brought everything up.

01:56.125 --> 01:58.583
So stop faking the cramp
and just come on up.

01:58.583 --> 02:01.125
You guys are
ruining everything!

02:02.166 --> 02:04.708
- Cool! We're in Paris!
- Oh, no.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.875
Buenos dias.

02:08.583 --> 02:10.708
Wait a minute.

02:10.708 --> 02:11.958
I know what's going on here.

02:11.958 --> 02:14.958
- We're being rude.
- Yes!

02:14.958 --> 02:17.208
Justin made us dinner
to introduce us to Rosie.

02:17.208 --> 02:18.458
Come on everybody, let's eat.

02:18.458 --> 02:21.416
How sweet!

02:21.416 --> 02:24.208
- Mmmm.
- Smile.

03:18.708 --> 03:21.208
You can always count
on them to embarrass me.

03:21.208 --> 03:22.958
Only thing missing was my dad

03:22.958 --> 03:25.583
sucking hot cheese
through a snorkel.

03:25.583 --> 03:27.375
He did do that.

03:27.375 --> 03:28.416
What?

03:28.416 --> 03:30.833
Listen, Justin,

03:30.833 --> 03:33.083
why don't we just have a
do-over date tomorrow night?

03:33.083 --> 03:34.833
We can forget tonight
ever happened.

03:34.833 --> 03:35.875
Alright.

03:35.875 --> 03:37.083
Hey.

03:39.000 --> 03:40.833
You know where you
guys should go?

03:42.208 --> 03:46.208
I've heard of this crazy, fun
angel club in Los Angeles.

03:46.208 --> 03:48.875
I'm not an angel.
Do you think they'd let me in?

03:48.875 --> 03:51.833
More importantly...
would they let me in?

03:52.875 --> 03:56.000
Well, it is angels only.

03:56.000 --> 03:57.458
I don't think
it's a good idea.

03:57.458 --> 03:59.000
Yeah, Alex,
it's not gonna happen.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.708
You always got some
kinda scam going on up there.

04:00.708 --> 04:03.833
Yeah, you're right.
I am bad.

04:03.833 --> 04:06.458
Maybe... maybe being
around all those angels

04:06.458 --> 04:08.125
would be a good
influence on me.

04:08.125 --> 04:10.000
So, if you take me,
you'll be doing a good thing.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
And if you don't take me,

04:12.000 --> 04:15.708
well, you'll be doing
the opposite of a good thing.

04:15.708 --> 04:18.583
You're manipulating an angel.
What kind of a person does that?

04:18.583 --> 04:21.375
The kind who wants to take
her best friend to an angel club

04:21.375 --> 04:22.833
for the best night
of her life.

04:22.833 --> 04:23.875
I get to go too?

04:25.166 --> 04:27.833
Now Rosie, you don't wanna
do the wrong thing here.

04:29.208 --> 04:31.000
It's true.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.458
I never do the wrong thing.

04:32.458 --> 04:34.000
Oh! Then it's settled.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.750
You're doing good by
taking us to the club.

04:35.750 --> 04:37.458
Uh-uh. Not good.
Nothing's settled.

04:37.458 --> 04:39.291
I'm not gonna let you
ruin something that we...

04:39.291 --> 04:41.625
I can't wait to dance with you
at the angel club.

04:41.625 --> 04:45.083
Another mind message.
I love those.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.458
We're going to the club.

04:46.458 --> 04:49.250
What just happened?

04:49.250 --> 04:50.458
I may pay for this later,

04:50.458 --> 04:53.083
but I think I just
manipulated an angel.

04:53.083 --> 04:55.250
OK. I'll see you guys tomorrow.

04:55.250 --> 04:56.375
Yes.

04:56.375 --> 04:59.875
This is gonna be awesome!

04:59.875 --> 05:02.583
I finally have an excuse
to make angel wings.

05:02.583 --> 05:05.416
Wow. This is the first time
one of your outfits is actually

05:05.416 --> 05:07.625
- gonna help you blend in.
- Kinda weird, right?

05:07.625 --> 05:11.583
Alex, I don't want you to
ruin my date with Rosie.

05:11.583 --> 05:13.291
I don't know
if you know this,

05:13.291 --> 05:14.625
but she's a little
outta my league.

05:14.625 --> 05:16.958
Well, if you wanna date someone
who's in your league,

05:16.958 --> 05:19.000
you should date Glenda,
from the hardware store.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.333
You know, the girl whose head
is shaped like a raindrop.

05:24.166 --> 05:27.458
Alex, I'm serious, alright?
I like Rosie.

05:27.458 --> 05:29.750
After Juliet, I thought I
might not ever meet someone

05:29.750 --> 05:31.708
that I felt this way about.

05:31.708 --> 05:35.083
OK, Jimmy Soap Opera,
I get it.

05:36.708 --> 05:39.000
Alright, you won't even
see me there.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.708
But, if it doesn't
work out with Rosie,

05:40.708 --> 05:43.083
I've been telling Glenda
about you for months now,

05:43.083 --> 05:46.750
and I think...
she's interested.

05:50.458 --> 05:51.458
So, Alex.

05:51.458 --> 05:53.291
Oh my gosh, Max.
You scared me.

05:53.291 --> 05:58.250
Actually, Mom and Dad are gonna
be the ones who are scared.

05:58.250 --> 06:01.333
When they find out that
you're going to Los Angeles
without telling them.

06:01.333 --> 06:04.333
And how would they find out?

06:04.333 --> 06:06.291
I don't know.

06:06.291 --> 06:09.166
Sometimes they hear things
from someone

06:09.166 --> 06:13.208
who could easily be quiet
if he had a souvenir
from Los Angeles.

06:13.208 --> 06:17.500
Alright, what kind of souvenir
does this someone want?

06:17.500 --> 06:20.083
This someone wants you
to bring him back

06:20.083 --> 06:23.458
Ozzy Osbourne's star,
from the Hollywood Walk-of-Fame.

06:24.750 --> 06:27.333
Fine.

06:29.583 --> 06:33.125
Oh, you know the someone we're
talking about is me, right?

06:33.125 --> 06:34.583
Oh my gosh! No way!

06:44.125 --> 06:47.416
Wow. Flashing in
is so awesome.

06:47.416 --> 06:49.083
So much faster than flying.

06:49.083 --> 06:50.958
And you don't have to worry
about those lazy birds

06:50.958 --> 06:52.083
trying to hitch a ride on you.

06:52.083 --> 06:53.458
Plus, Harper's homemade wings

06:53.458 --> 06:55.083
would have never
made the flight.

06:55.083 --> 06:57.458
They're uh... kinda floppy.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.750
Yeah, you don't wanna bend
a wing. You'll fly in a circle.

07:01.875 --> 07:05.000
Wow. The Hollywood sign.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.875
In person. This is amazing.

07:07.875 --> 07:09.458
It's like a dream.

07:09.458 --> 07:11.875
You dreamt of standing
in front of giant letters?

07:11.875 --> 07:15.375
Well, the dream part
was... you.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.458
Well, it's not a dream.

07:21.416 --> 07:23.250
I love Los Angeles.

07:23.250 --> 07:26.333
Nobody even noticed two
teenage girls wearing wings

07:26.333 --> 07:28.458
ripping a star out of
the Hollywood Walk-of-Fame.

07:28.458 --> 07:30.750
Yeah, they were all just
looking for celebrities.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.166
What a bunch of losers.

07:32.166 --> 07:34.125
I just bought a map that
showed me where they all live.

07:36.166 --> 07:38.833
Wait. Alex, isn't it
gonna be awkward dancing

07:38.833 --> 07:40.833
with a big piece of sidewalk
in your hands all night?

07:40.833 --> 07:43.250
Yeah, you're right.
Here, hold this.

07:47.500 --> 07:50.291
Key Largo, Key West,
keychain.

07:58.708 --> 08:00.458
Hey, what took you guys
so long?

08:00.458 --> 08:03.291
Oh, we, uh... we stopped
to get Max a souvenir.

08:03.291 --> 08:05.291
OK, you guys ready to go in?

08:05.291 --> 08:09.458
Gosh. In where? Is the club
behind the Hollywood sign?

08:09.458 --> 08:11.375
No, the secret entrance
is here.

08:11.375 --> 08:13.458
Inside the "H".

08:15.166 --> 08:17.000
OK guys, follow me.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.458
Oh! This is so exciting.

08:18.458 --> 08:19.708
Let's go in and pretend
like we're angels.

08:19.708 --> 08:21.875
- OK.
- That'll be tough for Alex.

08:21.875 --> 08:24.000
Hey! At least
my wing's not bent.

08:36.708 --> 08:39.250
OK guys, we just have to talk to
the manager and then we're in.

08:39.250 --> 08:41.625
What? They'll know
we're not angels.

08:41.625 --> 08:45.125
Stop! I haven't seen you guys
here before.

08:47.708 --> 08:50.458
So, let me tell you about
all the fun you're gonna have.

08:50.458 --> 08:53.583
It's OK. I've actually
been here before

08:53.583 --> 08:54.875
so I can kind of
show them around.

08:54.875 --> 08:56.291
Great! Great.

08:56.291 --> 08:59.250
I'm Zeedrik,
if you have any questions,
just let me know.

09:02.250 --> 09:06.083
Wait.
Where are you guys from?

09:06.083 --> 09:09.083
Angel-opolis... ville.

09:09.083 --> 09:11.583
I don't think so.

09:12.750 --> 09:16.000
Tonight, you live
on the dance floor.

09:18.458 --> 09:21.958
Hold on a second.

09:21.958 --> 09:23.958
Let me see those wings.

09:23.958 --> 09:27.083
Those aren't angel of darkness
wings, are they?

09:29.291 --> 09:32.250
No?

09:32.250 --> 09:35.875
Angels don't lie.
That's good enough for me.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.291
We made it in.

09:41.291 --> 09:43.750
What are angels of darkness?

09:43.750 --> 09:44.958
Oh, they're bad angels.

09:44.958 --> 09:46.583
If you get too close
to one, they can draw you

09:46.583 --> 09:48.458
to the dark side and
make you do bad things.

09:48.458 --> 09:50.375
We have one of those
in the wizard world.

09:50.375 --> 09:51.708
It's called Alex.

09:56.083 --> 09:59.000
Alright. Ready to have
some fun, Harper?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.750
Yeah. This place is pretty
high up on the list of things

10:01.750 --> 10:04.333
I'd love to be able
to tell someone about,
but can't. Come on!

10:14.583 --> 10:17.583
Max, where are Alex,
Justin and Harper?

10:17.583 --> 10:19.083
They didn't show up for work.

10:19.083 --> 10:20.583
I'm covering for their shifts.

10:20.583 --> 10:22.750
Right now, I'm
covering for Alex.

10:22.750 --> 10:26.333
See? I'm reading a magazine.

10:27.500 --> 10:30.250
Uh, where did they go?

10:30.250 --> 10:31.750
They all took a trip to...

10:33.583 --> 10:36.458
I don't know.
They're your kids.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.000
Trip?

10:38.000 --> 10:41.000
Max.

10:41.000 --> 10:42.416
Max, you tell us
where they went

10:42.416 --> 10:43.708
or I'll send you
to your room.

10:43.708 --> 10:46.708
Sweet. I love my room.

10:46.708 --> 10:49.291
Then you can never
go there again.

10:49.291 --> 10:50.958
I never liked my room anyway.

10:52.750 --> 10:55.625
Jerry, how are we supposed
to punish this thing?

10:55.625 --> 10:58.333
Sorry, but I'm not talking.

10:58.333 --> 11:00.458
I've got a lot riding on this.

11:02.458 --> 11:04.958
Wait, Max.
Did you see this?

11:04.958 --> 11:08.166
Look, it's the annual
Little Miss Waverly Place
Pageant.

11:08.166 --> 11:10.458
Tonight. And look, Jerry,
it's not too late

11:10.458 --> 11:13.833
to enter your seven
to twelve year-old girl.

11:13.833 --> 11:17.125
Yeah, but I'm a guy.

11:17.125 --> 11:19.416
Oh, you wouldn't.

11:19.416 --> 11:24.708
Have you met us?
Oh, yes we would.

11:24.708 --> 11:27.750
It's your choice. You can
answer some questions now,

11:27.750 --> 11:30.291
like, "Where are Alex,
Justin and Harper?",

11:30.291 --> 11:32.000
or you can answer
some questions later,

11:32.000 --> 11:33.875
like, "What will you be doing

11:33.875 --> 11:35.500
for the talent portion
of the competition?"

11:43.500 --> 11:45.875
Lean and step.
Lean and step.

11:45.875 --> 11:47.875
Check out the club.
Check out the club.

11:50.583 --> 11:53.125
I'm really getting the hang
of this angel slide thing.

11:53.125 --> 11:55.708
Yeah. It's not that hard
when they're saying
exactly what to do.

11:55.708 --> 11:58.875
Stop talking, so I can hear
what I'm supposed to do.

11:58.875 --> 11:59.875
Lean to the right.

11:59.875 --> 12:01.583
Go down.

12:01.583 --> 12:04.250
Now slide, angel slide.

12:04.250 --> 12:06.708
Slide, angel slide.
Come on!

12:06.708 --> 12:08.583
Slide, angel slide.
Come on!

12:08.583 --> 12:10.583
Slide, angel slide.
Yeah!

12:10.583 --> 12:12.416
Slide, angel slide.
Come on!

12:12.416 --> 12:13.875
Slide, angel slide.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.250
- Yeah!
- Smile.

12:18.125 --> 12:20.708
Ah, I blocked your face again.

12:20.708 --> 12:22.458
These stupid wings are
making it really hard for me

12:22.458 --> 12:24.000
to prove this is
the best date ever.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.291
- I'll prove it.
- Oh.

12:27.291 --> 12:29.083
Slide, angel slide.
Come on!

12:29.083 --> 12:30.250
Oh my gosh.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.250
What?

12:31.250 --> 12:33.875
Is it my breath?

12:33.875 --> 12:36.125
I've been on a no-stinky-food
diet since Thursday,

12:36.125 --> 12:37.583
just in case I got
the chance to kiss you.

12:37.583 --> 12:39.416
So, it's not my breath.

12:39.416 --> 12:42.291
Alex and Harper are doing
the angel slide.

12:42.291 --> 12:43.250
We have to stop them.

12:44.625 --> 12:47.416
Why?

12:47.416 --> 12:49.500
Wings up.
Wings down.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.416
Wings up.
Wings down.

12:51.416 --> 12:53.625
Now all the angels fly up!

12:53.625 --> 12:55.250
No!

12:58.708 --> 13:01.291
Oh, that's why.

13:11.416 --> 13:14.458
I said, "fly up",

13:14.458 --> 13:17.583
and two angels didn't "fly up."

13:21.500 --> 13:25.416
You know I would, but I just
sprained a wing jogging.

13:25.416 --> 13:28.583
So, it's like...
not working for me.

13:28.583 --> 13:30.708
And I don't know what
her excuse is.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.000
You're not angels.
Who are you?

13:37.000 --> 13:38.458
Rosie, let's get
out of here,

13:38.458 --> 13:39.625
before our date's
totally ruined.

13:39.625 --> 13:41.875
Whoa! You two stick around.

13:41.875 --> 13:44.416
No one's going anywhere.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.750
I knew I shouldn't have
let you come here, Alex.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.000
Relax, I can get us
out of this.

13:57.000 --> 13:59.750
Come on, Zeedrik.
Let us out of this.

13:59.750 --> 14:05.291
You're right. I should let you
out of this, but I won't.

14:05.291 --> 14:07.000
I don't think you're angels.

14:07.000 --> 14:10.375
We should run,
but I don't know where.

14:10.375 --> 14:12.583
And he's right there,
so he probably heard me.

14:12.583 --> 14:13.583
Never mind.

14:15.208 --> 14:19.583
Come on, Zeedrik.
We're angels, we've got wings.

14:19.583 --> 14:21.875
Don't look at them too closely.

14:21.875 --> 14:25.166
Then prove it. By flying.

14:25.166 --> 14:27.708
Nobody passes up that part
of the angel slide.

14:27.708 --> 14:29.458
It's literally
the only fun part.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.708
I'm just gonna
do the right thing

14:32.708 --> 14:34.291
and tell him
you're not angels.

14:34.291 --> 14:36.583
I brought you here.
I'll take the blame.

14:36.583 --> 14:39.416
No, I'm not letting you
take the blame for them.

14:39.416 --> 14:41.375
Alex, distract him.
I'll handle this.

14:41.375 --> 14:45.416
Say, Zeedrik,
I love this club.

14:45.416 --> 14:46.958
I'm digging the white.

14:46.958 --> 14:48.833
Tell me, tell me,
what is your secret

14:48.833 --> 14:51.166
for handling
grape juice stains?

14:53.583 --> 14:56.500
Zeedrik. This one can fly.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.208
No, I can't.

14:58.208 --> 14:59.875
Uh-oh.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.083
See? We're angels.

15:16.083 --> 15:17.708
Ta-da!

15:19.708 --> 15:22.500
There's more to being an angel
than just flying.

15:22.500 --> 15:24.250
I've got another test.

15:24.250 --> 15:30.083
All angels can play
the harp and sing.

15:32.500 --> 15:34.625
Well, here, you're Harper.

15:40.291 --> 15:42.625
I don't care what
you make me look like,

15:42.625 --> 15:44.958
I know that you guys
are just bluffing.

15:44.958 --> 15:48.458
And I'm not gonna tell you
where Alex and Justin went.

15:48.458 --> 15:51.083
Oh, really? How 'bout now?

15:53.750 --> 15:55.583
What have you done to me?

15:58.083 --> 16:00.333
Because I love it.

16:02.458 --> 16:04.291
Ya can't crack me.

16:04.291 --> 16:10.208
OK. I didn't think it
would come to this, but...

16:10.208 --> 16:14.416
...look what Mommy bought you.

16:16.333 --> 16:19.166
Get along, little doggy.

16:23.166 --> 16:25.958
Quit stalling,
suspicious angels.

16:25.958 --> 16:28.166
I want to see you play.

16:28.166 --> 16:30.291
OK, I'll go first.

16:34.875 --> 16:37.625
Pling ping-ping
ping ping-ping.

16:37.625 --> 16:40.000
- I'll play, you sing.
- OK.

16:41.625 --> 16:45.250
♪ Twinkle twinkle
little angels ♪

16:45.250 --> 16:46.958
- ♪ Angels
- ♪ If you wonder

16:46.958 --> 16:49.458
♪ We are angels ♪♪

16:51.208 --> 16:53.958
Harp solo!

17:03.000 --> 17:05.708
OK. Ta-da!

17:05.708 --> 17:08.166
Alright.
You're angels.

17:08.166 --> 17:11.833
Horribly awkward, untalented
flabby wing, tone deaf...

17:11.833 --> 17:14.583
OK, OK. So he said it,
we're angels.

17:14.583 --> 17:16.208
Alright, let's get back
to the slide.

17:16.208 --> 17:18.291
Crank up the slide.
Crank up the...

17:20.375 --> 17:22.250
Oh, no.

17:23.833 --> 17:27.750
What's that? A star from
the Hollywood Walk-of-Fame?

17:27.750 --> 17:31.583
Well, how did
that get in here?

17:31.583 --> 17:35.000
That belongs to Ozzy Osbourne,
not us. Right, angels?

17:35.000 --> 17:37.125
- Yeah, right.
- Right!

17:37.125 --> 17:40.333
You took that!
If you're angels...

17:40.333 --> 17:42.208
You're angels of darkness.

17:42.208 --> 17:45.000
Pull the alarm!
Everybody, get out!

17:47.875 --> 17:49.291
Rosie!

17:49.291 --> 17:51.583
Rosie!

17:54.875 --> 17:58.125
She's gone.
Nice going, Alex.

17:58.125 --> 17:59.875
This is exactly why I
didn't want you to come.

17:59.875 --> 18:01.458
I knew you'd ruin it.

18:01.458 --> 18:05.375
Justin, I'm sorry. I didn't mean
for all this to happen.

18:05.375 --> 18:08.750
You never mean for
things to happen.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.375
You just don't get it.

18:10.375 --> 18:13.166
This was my second chance
at love, and now she's gone.

18:20.583 --> 18:22.583
Way to go, Harper.

18:23.833 --> 18:25.416
Way to make a mess of things.

18:25.416 --> 18:26.708
- Me?
- I know.

18:26.708 --> 18:29.583
I just wanted to say it for once
instead of hearing it, OK?

18:30.958 --> 18:33.125
Alright, let's get this thing
back to Hollywood.

18:33.125 --> 18:35.416
Being around all
these angels is starting

18:35.416 --> 18:37.125
to make me feel like I
should do the right thing.

18:37.125 --> 18:39.125
I really hope that wears off.

18:46.125 --> 18:49.000
That was wonderful.

18:50.166 --> 18:52.875
Oh Max, honey,
I have to tell you,

18:52.875 --> 18:55.958
you are the cutest little
cowgirl I've ever seen.

18:55.958 --> 18:57.875
You did a really good
job on him.

18:59.166 --> 19:02.375
I think he's got a real chance
at winning this pageant.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.875
Come on. I mean, you're
not really gonna do this

19:04.875 --> 19:07.000
to your own son, are you?

19:07.000 --> 19:12.125
Next up is Waverly Place's
own Maxine Russo.

19:12.125 --> 19:14.625
- Oh!
- Oh, that's you, cutie.

19:14.625 --> 19:16.375
Get up there and
knock 'em dead.

19:16.375 --> 19:17.500
- Woo.
- Go up.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.583
OK, I'll tell you!

19:29.583 --> 19:32.583
Alex and Harper and Justin all
went to Los Angeles with Rosie

19:32.583 --> 19:34.708
to some angel club.

19:34.708 --> 19:39.333
Oh. Well, Rosie's an angel,
so, they're OK.

19:39.333 --> 19:40.583
OK.

19:40.583 --> 19:44.166
Now, get up there and
win this for Mommy!

19:45.291 --> 19:47.625
But I told you
where they went.

19:47.625 --> 19:49.291
Yes. Yes, yes you did.

19:49.291 --> 19:51.208
Um, but we don't care
about that right now.

19:51.208 --> 19:54.208
What's important is you
winning this competition.

19:54.208 --> 19:56.333
Go get our trophy!

19:56.333 --> 19:58.708
Come on, now!

20:02.166 --> 20:04.000
Uh, what the heck?

20:06.583 --> 20:07.583
Smile.

20:11.708 --> 20:13.458
The hat! The hat!

20:13.458 --> 20:17.458
Yeah!
Woo! Woo-hoo!

20:23.416 --> 20:25.833
Justin?

20:25.833 --> 20:28.875
Rosie. Uh...

20:28.875 --> 20:30.083
You're still here.

20:30.083 --> 20:32.083
I... I thought
that you took off.

20:32.083 --> 20:34.708
You thought I would take off
without you?

20:34.708 --> 20:38.250
No. I just lost you
in all that chaos.

20:38.250 --> 20:41.958
Look, I don't even know where
to begin to apologize.

20:41.958 --> 20:43.583
This was supposed to be
our do-over date.

20:43.583 --> 20:44.875
It was even worse
than the last one.

20:44.875 --> 20:47.750
Justin, it's not about
any one date.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.875
We're gonna have
lots of dates.

20:49.875 --> 20:51.875
We are?

20:53.875 --> 20:56.000
I don't know if it's
the fear of losing you,

20:56.000 --> 20:57.708
or the fact that
a coyote could come out

20:57.708 --> 20:59.166
of the woods
and eat us right now,

20:59.166 --> 21:01.583
but I'm just gonna...
just gonna lay it on out there.

21:03.291 --> 21:05.208
You mean a lot to me.

21:05.208 --> 21:09.958
And you mean a lot to me.
Why are you trying so hard?

21:12.583 --> 21:15.708
I was in love once.
And I lost her.

21:15.708 --> 21:20.250
And... now I've been given
this second chance.

21:20.250 --> 21:23.291
And who gets second chances?

21:23.291 --> 21:25.833
I just don't wanna mess it up.

21:25.833 --> 21:28.875
Justin, nothing is
going to mess this up.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.750
Are you just saying that
because you're an angel
and you're obligated to?

21:33.750 --> 21:36.625
Don't ruin the moment, Justin.

21:49.083 --> 21:50.583
Do you think Max
will be upset

21:50.583 --> 21:52.291
that we don't have
Ozzy Osbourne's star?

21:52.291 --> 21:53.583
Um.

21:55.750 --> 21:59.708
No, no, no, no. I think he has
much bigger problems.

22:03.458 --> 22:05.625
Mom and Dad entered me
in a beauty pageant.

22:05.625 --> 22:08.208
Oh gosh, that's awful.
And hilarious,

22:08.208 --> 22:11.000
but those are my favorite
combinations, so I like it.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.458
It gets worse.

22:13.458 --> 22:14.708
We won! Ha, ha!

22:15.875 --> 22:17.500
We won!

22:17.500 --> 22:20.708
There she is! Little Miss
Waverly Place!

22:20.708 --> 22:22.875
You got two weeks
to learn how to lasso.

22:22.875 --> 22:24.875
'Cause we're going
to regionals!
