01:27.400 --> 01:28.731
THE WOLF

01:41.000 --> 01:42.764
WORLD ACCORDING TO THE WOLF

01:44.200 --> 01:51.163
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, the one and
only Tomek "The Wolf" Wilczynski!</i>

01:57.400 --> 02:02.327
Good evening, I'm Tomek Wilczynski
and this is my co-host Angela!

02:03.880 --> 02:07.726
The most overhyped day of the year!
Everyone have a Happy Valentines!

02:10.160 --> 02:13.164
And a close-up on Tomek... now.

02:14.160 --> 02:20.805
<i>Who came up with these holidays symbols?
Were they high?</i>

02:20.920 --> 02:22.365
<i>Take Easter for example.</i>

02:22.440 --> 02:26.684
<i>A magical bunny... laying eggs...
made of chocolate?</i>

02:28.200 --> 02:30.009
<i>Valentine's Day is at least coherent.</i>

02:30.280 --> 02:33.648
<i>Flowers, hearts,
a romantic comedy at the cinema...</i>

02:33.760 --> 02:35.603
And then an awkward blow job.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.367
For you, I'd skip the movie.

02:43.400 --> 02:44.925
Shoot. My battery's at 5%.

02:45.000 --> 02:48.607
This is pointless.
Who goes on Internet dates?

02:48.880 --> 02:52.771
- Normal people don't meet on the web.
- So me and Bogdan, we're not normal?

02:52.920 --> 02:54.251
You're an exception.

02:54.560 --> 02:56.289
I want to meet someone in a normal way.

02:56.520 --> 03:00.650
Put on your white turtleneck,
brush your teeth, smile

03:00.840 --> 03:02.410
and go meet that...
what's his name?

03:02.800 --> 03:03.562
Ant_Man.

03:03.640 --> 03:05.449
- Yeah, but what's his name?
- See?

03:05.920 --> 03:09.003
- I don't even know his name.
- Darling, relax.

03:09.360 --> 03:12.523
It's a first date, not marriage counseling.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.042
You'll get the laptop
once you help your mother.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.000
And remember,

03:18.160 --> 03:21.403
you don't get a second shot
at making the first impression.

03:22.440 --> 03:27.002
Tomorrow you're going to help your
mother at the salon and that's final!

03:27.120 --> 03:29.885
She's not my mother!
Stop calling her that!

03:30.040 --> 03:32.771
My mother's a lawyer,
not some dumb hairdresser!

03:32.840 --> 03:34.001
She left us because of you.

03:34.120 --> 03:36.043
Pardon me, darling,
I'm on the phone.

03:36.440 --> 03:37.851
I hate you both!

03:38.440 --> 03:40.442
<i>I'll</i> call you later, ok?

03:42.000 --> 03:45.846
It's only temporary. She'll probably
be fired within a week, as usual.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.051
What did you say?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.126
<i>Now that was not funny.</i>

03:59.960 --> 04:01.246
Hi, morn.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.843
Here are your groceries and mail.

04:12.680 --> 04:17.048
Happy Valentine's Day.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.409
What's there to be happy about?

04:23.240 --> 04:24.401
Yeah, right.

04:25.560 --> 04:28.609
- Bye, morn. I'm off.
- Where to? In the middle of the night?

04:28.800 --> 04:31.167
- It's 9 p.m. I'm seeing someone.
- Whom?

04:31.720 --> 04:34.849
I have a right to know who
you're meeting at night!

04:35.040 --> 04:36.724
I'm almost thirty!

04:54.880 --> 04:56.689
Good evening.

04:57.080 --> 05:00.766
- How can I help you?
- I have a reservation for two.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.325
Name, please?

05:04.840 --> 05:05.966
Ant_Man.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.731
No such name.

05:10.640 --> 05:12.244
I'm sorry.

05:13.640 --> 05:17.281
Do you have many reservations for 9.30PM?

05:18.360 --> 05:21.091
- One.
- Well, that's ours.

05:23.080 --> 05:24.241
There you are.

05:25.080 --> 05:28.846
It's Women's Day in three weeks.
70% of your audience is women.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.047
Awesome

05:30.080 --> 05:31.161
<i>Got any plans?</i>

05:31.240 --> 05:33.129
So stop insulting them.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.127
<i>Not with you, asshole.</i>

05:34.160 --> 05:37.130
- Ls Beata angry?
- Which Beata?

05:39.520 --> 05:40.726
I'm not sure.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.685
You fucked her sister.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.881
See? You don't even realize...

05:48.640 --> 05:50.376
Should we start you off
with something to drink?

05:50.400 --> 05:52.004
I'm still waiting for someone.

05:52.200 --> 05:55.682
In that case <i>I'll</i> be waiting
with bated breath.

06:04.280 --> 06:08.444
<i>They're women. They're mothers.
Or they will be one day.</i>

06:08.720 --> 06:15.330
<i>Sisters, wives, daughters, grandmothers,
heads of networks,</i>

06:15.640 --> 06:19.611
<i>keep ridiculing them
or you'll lose your audience.</i>

06:22.520 --> 06:23.646
He's not coming.

06:23.720 --> 06:25.722
OK, just figure it out.

06:47.720 --> 06:48.767
Hi.

06:49.320 --> 06:51.641
Sorry I'm late. Heavy traffic.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.326
These are good.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.648
A little heavy on the garlic, though...

06:58.200 --> 06:59.440
Ant_Man?

07:00.400 --> 07:01.890
Ant_Man?

07:03.280 --> 07:05.169
Your first Internet date.

07:05.800 --> 07:06.642
Fifth.

07:06.720 --> 07:09.803
If it was your fifth, you'd say
it was your first.

07:10.600 --> 07:12.967
Because after the third, you realise
how embarrassing it is.

07:13.560 --> 07:15.324
- It's not embarrassing.
- It's not?

07:15.720 --> 07:19.042
You're not embarrassed that someone
stood you up on Valentine's Day?

07:21.760 --> 07:23.125
Listen, Kasia.

07:24.440 --> 07:25.930
<i>Ama.</i>

07:26.120 --> 07:29.647
What do you say
we go somewhere else?

07:30.840 --> 07:31.966
Now?

07:32.120 --> 07:35.567
I wanted to eat something first,
but if you're this eager...

07:36.040 --> 07:37.201
Funny.

07:38.080 --> 07:38.967
But no thanks.

07:39.040 --> 07:40.451
Tomek Wilczynski?

07:41.320 --> 07:43.004
God, I love your show.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.969
- Could I get a photo?
- Sure.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.404
Would you mind?

07:50.080 --> 07:51.605
Come here.

07:56.280 --> 07:57.691
Done.

08:00.160 --> 08:02.083
If you need anything,
we're over there.

08:02.360 --> 08:03.964
I've got my eyes on you.

08:04.760 --> 08:06.444
Work, work, work.
I need a vacation.

08:06.640 --> 08:08.051
What were we talking about?

08:11.040 --> 08:12.849
Ok, so chicks are fawning over you.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.286
I'm not.

08:14.640 --> 08:17.120
And my guy's just a bit late.
Something probably came up.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.163
You'd rather talk first? Okay.

08:19.920 --> 08:21.331
<i>So what do you do, Ann'?</i>

08:27.600 --> 08:29.682
- I teach.
- Seriously? Teach what?

08:30.320 --> 08:31.924
Music.

08:32.280 --> 08:35.010
- At the conservatory?
- No. At school.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.570
Elementary.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.722
Okay, it's starting to make sense now.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.441
Oh yeah?

08:41.679 --> 08:42.806
What is?

08:43.280 --> 08:47.330
You wanted to be a musician.
Maybe even a composer, or a conductor.

08:47.440 --> 08:49.841
You dreamed of conducting
the Berlin Philharmonic,

08:50.000 --> 08:52.526
with the German Chancellor
in the first row.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.961
But it didn't work out.

08:54.160 --> 08:56.447
You ended up in school.
Hating it.

08:56.800 --> 08:59.246
What musician would want to teach
some tone-deaf brats?

08:59.320 --> 09:01.846
Banged-up instruments,
stuffy classrooms...

09:01.920 --> 09:04.810
- Besides, you're what, 30?
- 27.

09:04.880 --> 09:08.327
Exactly! 37, with all these kids around,
and none of them yours.

09:08.400 --> 09:10.402
Why?
Because you have no kids.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.369
Why?
Well, who would you have them with?

09:12.440 --> 09:15.728
At work you're surrounded
by other frustrated losers.

09:15.920 --> 09:20.050
Your clock is ticking, you try to keep
your head up, but you're terrified

09:20.720 --> 09:22.449
that no one will ever love you

09:22.640 --> 09:25.007
and you're destined
to grow old and die alone.

09:25.880 --> 09:28.042
No, I need to change something.

09:28.160 --> 09:30.162
So you go on an Internet date.

09:30.520 --> 09:34.127
Because being alone
on Valentines - pathetic.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.047
And you know what?

09:37.160 --> 09:38.810
That guy actually did come here.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.727
Walked in that door, saw you,

09:41.920 --> 09:44.844
sensed your desperation and figured...

09:44.960 --> 09:48.885
he'd get more action at home with
a 6-pack and a good internet connection.

09:52.360 --> 09:54.408
Well? Did I get it right?

10:00.920 --> 10:02.763
So, off we go?

10:05.520 --> 10:07.170
- Listen, asshole.
- Tomek.

10:07.280 --> 10:10.762
You don't get shit.
You're like this to me.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.376
The only big thing
about you is your ego.

10:12.400 --> 10:15.370
Men used to have honor, principles,
they conquered the world for women

10:15.880 --> 10:18.804
they were chivalrous,
like knights on white horses.

10:18.920 --> 10:22.163
But what would you know about that?
All you know are stupid lines like:

10:22.320 --> 10:28.282
“Hey, I'm a celebrity, let's do a selfie
and go to my place, cause I'm awesome!”

10:29.520 --> 10:32.922
I'd rather die alone than
go home with a creep like you.

10:58.680 --> 11:00.170
Miss...

11:00.880 --> 11:03.121
- Miss Ania!
- Yes?

11:03.240 --> 11:04.366
Look.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.928
Let's imagine it's our G.

11:13.680 --> 11:14.761
<i>Hey-</i>

11:15.960 --> 11:18.850
That's all for today.
You did great.

11:19.160 --> 11:20.286
Wonderful.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.564
- Hello, principal.
- Hello, Ela.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.447
- Making progress, isn't she.
- We'd make more with a working piano.

11:28.600 --> 11:31.206
Sure, that's the first thing I'll get
when I win the lottery.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.282
That's not why I'm here.

11:35.960 --> 11:38.042
You're going to have to rehearse
in the gymnasium.

11:38.160 --> 11:43.803
- Work it out with the new PE teacher.
- You promised me a new room.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.929
How am I supposed
to prepare the concert there?

11:46.200 --> 11:49.966
I don't have a new room,
and I need this one.

11:50.120 --> 11:54.762
Besides, do you know how much it costs
to support your music program?

11:55.520 --> 11:57.522
- It costs a lot.
- I know.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.091
Could we at least just fix the piano?

12:01.200 --> 12:03.567
I already told you
we do not have the budget.

12:04.160 --> 12:08.006
I'd gladly buy you one
myself, if I could.

12:08.880 --> 12:12.009
But I can't. Get it?

12:12.360 --> 12:14.886
I don't have any money.

12:15.160 --> 12:17.447
Not a dime.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.007
What I do have is a wife,
and a daughter.

12:20.560 --> 12:24.326
One is glued to the Internet,
taking selfies all day,

12:24.400 --> 12:27.609
and the other can't hold down
a job for a month

12:27.680 --> 12:29.887
because she thinks
she's an artist!

12:30.040 --> 12:31.963
A fucking artist!

12:32.160 --> 12:35.084
And she thinks it's some incredible
work of art she's creating

12:35.240 --> 12:38.847
when it's really just a goddamn haircut!

12:38.920 --> 12:41.002
- Bogdan...
- What?!

12:47.720 --> 12:49.245
I'm sorry.

12:50.280 --> 12:53.921
Mr. Malinowski, Miss Kwiatkowska.
Get acquainted, I'm off.

12:54.760 --> 12:55.966
Good day.

13:02.040 --> 13:04.407
- Is he always like this?
- Problems at home.

13:04.840 --> 13:06.922
- Piotr.
- Ania.

13:08.440 --> 13:09.646
Nice one.

13:11.120 --> 13:13.521
I used to have a band, I wanted
to earn my living that way.

13:13.560 --> 13:16.006
- Life had other plans.
- You played the bass?

13:16.400 --> 13:18.721
- The saxophone.
- But that's a bass clef.

13:19.240 --> 13:20.969
Yeah, I realised the next morning.

13:26.040 --> 13:30.364
- So how do we deal with the gymnasium?
- We'll work something out.

13:33.200 --> 13:38.604
So you got stood up by some Ant_Man,
propositioned by the sexiest guy on TV,

13:38.680 --> 13:43.083
and made a complete ass out of yourself
all in the same night? Impressive.

13:43.240 --> 13:46.244
- Could you tone it down a bit?
- Yes, of course, pardon me.

13:48.200 --> 13:52.171
Is he as... sit still... as cute
in person as he is on TV?

13:52.240 --> 13:54.242
I'd totally bang him!

13:54.440 --> 13:56.442
- Pardon me?
- Grab the broom, Zoska.

13:56.560 --> 14:01.441
- He's the biggest jerk I've ever met.
- You haven't met my boss then.

14:02.240 --> 14:04.049
Now toss your head back...

14:04.640 --> 14:06.642
look at this volume.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.082
And voila!

14:10.520 --> 14:13.285
- The new, incredible you.
- Beautiful.

14:13.600 --> 14:15.045
What's this?!

14:16.400 --> 14:18.402
Well, the new incredible you?

14:18.760 --> 14:22.401
Where is my long black hair?

14:23.440 --> 14:24.851
In the trash?

14:25.520 --> 14:31.527
You really look much better now.
Brighter, younger, even thinner...

14:31.560 --> 14:39.560
Miss... I asked you to just trim
my split ends and refresh my color.

14:39.760 --> 14:44.641
Yes, and I refreshed that black.
Now it's a fresh, modern auburn.

14:44.720 --> 14:47.166
I didn't ask for a fresh, modern auburn.

14:47.240 --> 14:50.961
I told you no one wears their hair
like that anymore! It's out of style!

14:51.200 --> 14:53.248
Excuse me? What do you mean:
out of style?!

14:53.960 --> 14:57.282
She wanted to say that you now
have a future look.

14:57.440 --> 14:58.885
I didn't want that!

14:59.000 --> 15:03.642
I thought you liked the future, your
last hairdo was from Planet of the Apes!

15:04.240 --> 15:09.804
Amateurs! You don't deserve me!

15:09.880 --> 15:11.769
Fired me after three days?

15:11.960 --> 15:15.169
I'm the best damn
hairdresser they ever had!

15:15.560 --> 15:17.562
- I know, amateurs.
- Help us, Zosia.

15:17.680 --> 15:21.162
What now?
Bogdan will kill me when he finds out.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.926
And he probably will.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.722
- I won't say a thing.
- And what will I do tomorrow?

15:26.960 --> 15:29.691
I'll leave you my keys
under the doormat.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.963
Really? You're a lifesaver.

15:34.160 --> 15:35.446
WORLD ACCORDING TO THE WOLF

15:41.200 --> 15:43.726
Out of all the orgasms I had recently,

15:43.760 --> 15:46.570
the biggest one came today
when I saw the calendar.

15:46.800 --> 15:49.451
International Women's Day!

15:52.440 --> 15:56.161
<i>Modern world's greatest achievement.</i>

15:56.440 --> 15:58.090
<i>Congratulations!</i>

15:58.400 --> 15:59.811
Asshole.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.810
Women have everything.

16:02.040 --> 16:06.284
They're strong! Ambitious!
Unhappy and obviously single!

16:06.320 --> 16:07.890
<i>I'm terribly sorry. I can explain.</i>

16:07.920 --> 16:08.920
Too late.

16:09.200 --> 16:13.728
unhappy women scare men away!

16:14.200 --> 16:18.728
<i>I recently met an interesting
example of the modern woman</i>

16:18.840 --> 16:23.801
on her first Internet date in her
natural habitat - the singles bar.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.445
<i>Meet</i> Hania!

16:27.320 --> 16:32.451
<i>You broke the record by waiting
for 2 hours, here's your diploma.</i>

16:33.120 --> 16:35.521
<i>No, thank you.
I'm still waiting for someone.</i>

16:36.000 --> 16:37.729
<i>Yes, but do they know you are?</i>

16:38.560 --> 16:40.085
<i>Let me help you.
What will you have?</i>

16:41.080 --> 16:44.163
<i>A knight conquering the world for women.</i>

16:44.520 --> 16:46.807
- Are you watching this?
- He can't do that!

16:47.240 --> 16:50.801
- Well, he actually can...
- He can't abuse people like that!

16:51.000 --> 16:52.889
And he has a white horse...

16:54.640 --> 16:57.041
- Jesus. A white horse?
- Well... yeah, a white horse...

16:57.440 --> 16:59.761
Now... this is embarrassing.

17:00.400 --> 17:01.976
Pardon me, that dish is not on the menu.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.446
May I suggest a businessman
with no time for his family,

17:05.960 --> 17:08.645
<i>an artist without a horse or a penny</i>

17:08.720 --> 17:11.609
<i>or a smoking hot beefcake
with a horse's brains.</i>

17:11.720 --> 17:13.563
- Which one do you choose?
- None of them!

17:13.720 --> 17:16.246
We didn't fight for equal rights just so...

17:16.359 --> 17:21.002
- I'm not like that at all.
- Well... you kind of are.

17:21.160 --> 17:23.127
What do I do?
Everyone will laugh at me.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.801
Relax, no one will recognize you.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.049
Then... I don't know who would be right.

17:30.360 --> 17:33.364
I told you, you look great
in that turtleneck.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.725
Excuse me a moment.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.765
- Hi, Ania
- Hi.

17:57.880 --> 18:02.169
- So, about that gymnasium...
- What were you guys talking about?

18:02.440 --> 18:04.010
The Wolf's show.

18:04.280 --> 18:07.841
- Really. You watch that show as well?
- Sometimes.

18:07.960 --> 18:11.282
Yesterday he had this funny puppet,

18:12.320 --> 18:16.689
this helpless,
bespectacled... pathetic...

18:16.760 --> 18:19.411
Why pathetic?
Maybe she just had principles?

18:20.040 --> 18:21.451
So you watched it too?

18:22.400 --> 18:26.530
A bit. You can't fault a puppet
for having standards.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.442
But she talked like my grandmother.

18:30.640 --> 18:34.565
Maybe your grandma is smart! Too bad men
today aren't more like our grandfathers!

18:36.680 --> 18:39.251
But my grandfather was an asshole.

18:42.920 --> 18:44.922
- Marcel, relax.
- We're gonna get cancelled!

18:45.200 --> 18:47.202
Trust me, women love being insulted.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.362
- Not this woman.
- Which woman?

18:49.600 --> 18:52.968
The independent, consciously childless,

18:53.160 --> 18:57.927
professionally fulfilled, 59-year-old
feminist icon who heads our network.

18:57.960 --> 19:03.000
- Is the icon in?
- Yes, she is... she's with someone now.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.361
<i>We'll wait.</i>

19:05.320 --> 19:06.890
I warned you to tone it down.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.570
I'm not being paid to tone it down.

19:08.880 --> 19:11.804
Besides, it was so funny I was
still laughing when I got home.

19:12.080 --> 19:15.527
You and your Neanderthal followers.
She'll fire us, you'll see.

19:15.880 --> 19:17.882
Thank you very much,
that's fantastic news!

19:17.960 --> 19:22.329
Have fun doing your shit TV!

19:25.880 --> 19:27.211
Fucking puppets!

19:29.520 --> 19:30.601
Good bye!

19:32.520 --> 19:34.204
<i>Bring them in, please.</i>

19:34.320 --> 19:36.209
Of course.

19:37.040 --> 19:40.249
The Director will see you now.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.602
- Maybe we should wait a bit...
- Come on.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.162
Let me read you something:

19:59.920 --> 20:03.970
<i>“Your network has reached a new low.</i>

20:04.600 --> 20:10.050
<i>Wilczynski is a sexist
and a chauvinist pig.</i>

20:10.920 --> 20:17.087
<i>I hope you cancel his pathetic show."</i>

20:19.400 --> 20:23.928
- First, let me start by saying...
- We received two thousand e-mails

20:24.040 --> 20:26.930
and got five thousand comments
on our profile.

20:29.640 --> 20:32.007
Please don't pull the show.

20:36.360 --> 20:41.048
I've decided to move you to Prime Time.
On the main network, instead of Rafal.

20:43.320 --> 20:45.288
Of course you'll need
to make some changes.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.527
Bigger budgets mean more responsibility.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.202
Aneta, ask Jacek in.

20:51.040 --> 20:56.251
I hope you understand. We need a producer
at the helm with some real experience.

20:56.400 --> 20:58.402
But I am the producer...

20:59.400 --> 21:01.641
Hello, Tomek.
It's a pleasure.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.689
- Hello, Marcin.
- Marcel.

21:07.280 --> 21:11.330
And of course you need to give people
what they want, what they like.

21:11.840 --> 21:14.207
We actually have some great ideas...

21:14.280 --> 21:20.765
Hania, and the things you said about
love and romanticism, that was a hit!

21:20.920 --> 21:22.251
That's what we're after.

21:22.520 --> 21:28.084
Yeah, but it was more of
a one-off thing, she's too boring...

21:28.400 --> 21:30.243
Tomek...

21:30.400 --> 21:33.290
you'll think of something,
you're creative.

21:34.120 --> 21:35.565
Sure thing.

21:36.240 --> 21:38.811
Step it up now! Good!

21:38.880 --> 21:41.167
What are they doing here?

21:49.200 --> 21:51.123
Look at that four-eyed one.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.649
- Enough! What was that?!
- Everything ok?

21:58.440 --> 22:00.249
PE is over, hit the locker room!

22:00.600 --> 22:02.648
You're staying here.
Five push-ups.

22:06.080 --> 22:07.684
We're okay.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.610
Stand up, please.

22:33.040 --> 22:34.121
Great.

22:34.920 --> 22:37.969
Yes, mom.
I'll be there in an hour.

22:38.720 --> 22:41.610
I know. I was at work. Bye.

22:41.840 --> 22:43.126
Hey, Ania.

22:44.040 --> 22:46.691
You really are a music teacher.
How quaint.

22:46.840 --> 22:48.922
- Get lost.
- Wait up, I need to talk to you.

22:49.040 --> 22:51.327
I don't have time.
Not for you!

22:52.040 --> 22:55.328
- You made me a laughing stock!
- I did? Come on.

22:55.920 --> 22:58.400
You know what they're calling me?
Pathetic.

22:58.600 --> 23:01.683
I'm not pathetic.
Emphatic maybe, but not pathetic!

23:01.760 --> 23:04.411
I never said you were.
Of course you're not.

23:04.680 --> 23:05.920
Could we...

23:06.440 --> 23:08.442
Will you roll down the window?

23:08.800 --> 23:10.290
I know you can still hear me.

23:14.240 --> 23:16.925
You know what's pathetic?
That you actually listen to that crap.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.923
You're a role model to kids...

23:19.000 --> 23:21.002
It's not mine, it's the radio.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.802
You don't want to talk?
Fine, <i>I'll</i> wait right here.

23:36.520 --> 23:37.520
Shit!

23:41.000 --> 23:44.721
- Are you okay? Should I call a doctor?
- A bartender.

23:45.040 --> 23:46.451
Shut up.

23:57.240 --> 23:59.242
You could've killed me.

24:03.040 --> 24:04.405
Listen,

24:05.880 --> 24:07.882
I wanted to apologize.

24:09.200 --> 24:13.603
I don't know why you're so pissed,
the show was a hit.

24:17.360 --> 24:24.403
And I thought that maybe we could...

24:24.560 --> 24:27.245
I'm still waiting for that apology.

24:28.320 --> 24:29.924
- Haven't I apologized?
- No.

24:30.160 --> 24:33.164
You said you wanted to, but never did.

24:33.360 --> 24:37.968
Then I am sorry. And I think
we should continue our co-operation.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.882
The plan is you go on dates,

24:42.720 --> 24:45.724
then tell me about them,

24:46.200 --> 24:48.771
and we use that for my skits.

24:50.920 --> 24:52.160
Simple, right?

24:52.880 --> 24:55.167
Let me get this straight.

24:55.240 --> 24:56.844
So I go on dates...

24:58.160 --> 25:02.768
Then I tell you about them.
Whom I met, where we went...

25:03.240 --> 25:05.720
And then you turn me
into an idiot on national TV?

25:05.840 --> 25:09.845
What? Please.
That's not what my show is about...

25:14.040 --> 25:17.408
Listen, we have quite a budget,
you wouldn't be working for free.

25:17.520 --> 25:19.522
You want to buy me?!
Like some whore...

25:21.560 --> 25:23.289
Did I say that?

25:23.800 --> 25:26.963
Jesus, talking to you
is like reading Tolstoy.

25:27.080 --> 25:29.287
- Dude...
- Tomek.

25:32.840 --> 25:34.251
Tomek.

25:34.920 --> 25:42.327
There's absolutely nothing
you could offer to convince me.

25:43.400 --> 25:46.085
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

25:48.320 --> 25:50.322
That's a real pity.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.527
Marcel, the piano didn't
work out, send it back.

25:57.760 --> 26:00.570
Yes, I know it's Steinway.

26:00.960 --> 26:06.888
Yes, I tried.
I know, those poor kids...

26:10.960 --> 26:12.530
How did you know?

26:13.120 --> 26:15.122
I did my homework.

26:15.800 --> 26:18.121
Actually, Marcel did.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.882
He's been doing it since high school.

26:22.560 --> 26:26.690
Ok, so how does this work?

26:27.680 --> 26:29.444
You stay with us for the whole season.

26:29.680 --> 26:32.650
If you back out - no piano.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.922
And if I fall in love?

26:38.640 --> 26:40.642
If you fall in love, the piano is yours,

26:41.200 --> 26:42.964
and you can leave whenever you want.

26:43.120 --> 26:45.122
But I could always lie to you.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.722
Just say that I fell in love.

26:49.760 --> 26:52.923
Then I guess I'll have to trust you.

26:54.920 --> 26:55.893
What is it?

26:55.918 --> 26:58.835
Some dating app. He
said it would be easy.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.769
- Try clicking this.
- I can't.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.006
Dinosaurs.

27:03.680 --> 27:06.763
It's only the hottest dating app around.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.761
I hope you're not using it?

27:09.880 --> 27:15.171
Of course not. All I do is watch cartoons,
I don't even know what a penis is.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.810
Very funny.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.009
Better show us how it works.

27:25.400 --> 27:27.084
This is an app for searching people.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.282
Here's a list of who “liked” you.

27:29.640 --> 27:32.769
A list of who you “liked”.
This is the chat.

27:33.280 --> 27:35.442
Swipe right to “like”,

27:35.600 --> 27:37.682
swipe left to... well... not.

27:37.960 --> 27:38.960
That's it.

27:40.200 --> 27:41.565
- That's it?
- That's it.

27:42.920 --> 27:46.845
So you click here... And there.
Oh, look, he has a doggy.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.371
No. Move on.

27:50.200 --> 27:55.206
- This one's cute.
- Are you crazy? He looks like a rapist.

27:55.760 --> 27:58.650
- Move on.
- This one looks nice.

27:58.920 --> 28:03.005
Book publisher... Who buys
books anymore? Move on.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.886
- Maybe this one... or that one.
- Wait, go back.

28:11.880 --> 28:13.086
Oh no.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.962
Sexy Dad_107?

28:24.160 --> 28:25.685
Give me that.

28:26.640 --> 28:27.640
It's Bogdan.

28:31.680 --> 28:35.127
Oh God, I knew it. He's always
coming home late.

28:35.280 --> 28:40.525
- He's searching for a younger one!
- I'm sure that's just a mix up.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.164
Are we playing retards now?

28:48.560 --> 28:52.326
Ok, so help me pick one. This one?

28:52.640 --> 28:54.927
Yeah, he's great.
We have to go.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.402
What? Wait...

28:58.520 --> 29:01.410
Promise me something.
Look at me!

29:02.760 --> 29:04.762
Promise me you won't do anything stupid.

29:07.320 --> 29:08.924
I promise.

29:11.160 --> 29:15.643
Zosia... You know, I need to help
Ania find the right guy.

29:17.360 --> 29:19.727
Could you set up a profile for me?

29:21.040 --> 29:23.202
Like... a real one, under your name?

29:23.360 --> 29:28.810
No, make up a fake name!
Krystyna, Halina, something.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.291
Krystyna? Halina?

29:30.440 --> 29:35.401
In 21st century?
You need something modern, like...

29:36.920 --> 29:38.445
FlirtyGirl.

29:39.360 --> 29:42.091
FlirtyGirl. Great.

29:42.400 --> 29:44.164
FlirtyGirl_22.

29:44.320 --> 29:46.322
Or maybe... 46.

29:46.880 --> 29:48.530
I said 22.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.241
Okay, calm down...

29:50.400 --> 29:52.402
<i>Mikolaj invites to his planet. Accept?</i>

29:52.720 --> 29:53.926
<i>Together on the same planet.</i>

30:03.440 --> 30:05.442
What can I get you?

30:06.520 --> 30:08.409
I'm waiting for someone.

30:08.520 --> 30:09.806
Ania?

30:11.560 --> 30:12.322
Mikolaj?

30:12.440 --> 30:15.171
Yes. How are you doing?

30:16.400 --> 30:18.004
I'm... very surprised, actually.

30:18.160 --> 30:22.165
- Why?
- You're here. On time. And handsome.

30:24.160 --> 30:25.685
Did I say that out loud?

30:26.000 --> 30:27.525
Say what out loud?

30:29.000 --> 30:30.729
You're funny!

30:31.360 --> 30:34.409
We talked, had a good time.

30:35.240 --> 30:36.890
We had a drink,

30:37.040 --> 30:39.771
and it was very nice.

30:40.680 --> 30:42.250
And then what?

30:44.040 --> 30:45.280
Nothing.

30:46.200 --> 30:47.406
Each of us went home.

30:47.640 --> 30:52.009
Wow. Great! Viewers will
drop dead from excitement!

30:52.080 --> 30:54.082
Great idea, Marcel!

30:56.440 --> 30:58.920
Ania, we really need you
to be open with us...

30:59.040 --> 31:02.726
- I'm off to hang myself.
- Wait, wait.

31:07.880 --> 31:09.450
Well, OK.

31:10.680 --> 31:12.682
- Two vodkas.
- No, thank you.

31:13.320 --> 31:15.243
Just the two vodkas then.

31:15.360 --> 31:16.691
Sure you don't want anything?

31:17.680 --> 31:19.682
Maybe a glass of water.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.684
He was nice.

31:27.040 --> 31:28.565
And sweet.

31:29.600 --> 31:31.364
But a little nervous.

31:36.640 --> 31:38.005
Much better now.

31:38.120 --> 31:41.203
Your profile said you publish books.

31:41.360 --> 31:44.204
- That's great, I love reading.
- Blah, that's boring.

31:44.600 --> 31:46.967
What I really love is football.
Two more vodkas.

31:47.280 --> 31:48.691
Make them double.

31:50.600 --> 31:52.045
Do you like football?

31:52.640 --> 31:56.042
- Well, I guess....
- Great!

31:59.120 --> 32:01.851
He kept ordering vodkas until
he had a full football team,

32:01.920 --> 32:04.844
so he could explain
how offside works.

32:06.040 --> 32:09.647
Here are the strikers, here's the ball...

32:12.040 --> 32:13.929
So when they pass here...

32:22.520 --> 32:25.330
It's the salmon!
Avoid the salmon!

32:27.880 --> 32:30.406
I'm sorry, but it's our first date.

32:31.560 --> 32:37.806
<i>Aya ya yay, that poor little Hania</i>

32:38.000 --> 32:41.163
<i>So young and so pretty
Her dates are so shitty</i>

32:41.320 --> 32:44.130
<i>You feel like throwing up!</i>

32:45.120 --> 32:48.363
That's all for today,
ladies and gentlemen.

32:48.880 --> 32:52.123
It was an absolute pleasure for me.

32:52.320 --> 32:53.320
See you next week!

32:53.400 --> 32:55.528
And a double Absolute for me!

32:57.280 --> 33:01.569
- Would you like anything else?
- Two more doubles. On the <i>lady!</i>

33:02.840 --> 33:05.684
<i>So you're a publisher.
Are you familiar with "Faust"?</i>

33:05.840 --> 33:09.561
<i>Familiar? I've got two of them
floating in my toilet at home!</i>

33:12.880 --> 33:17.249
<i>Waiter, more double vodkas!
I need to chase the single ones.</i>

33:18.160 --> 33:19.605
<i>Hey, hot stuff.</i>

33:28.280 --> 33:30.282
<i>Hey... handsome...</i>

33:33.000 --> 33:34.684
Wanna meet up?

33:37.560 --> 33:43.442
<i>How about some sexy pics first?</i>

33:52.360 --> 33:53.600
Son of a bitch.

34:03.880 --> 34:08.841
<i>Ok, that was actually kind of funny.</i>

34:17.880 --> 34:18.960
Hi.

34:20.400 --> 34:23.051
- Dominik?
- Kasia.

34:23.840 --> 34:27.286
- Ania.
- Pardons. Ania.

34:30.920 --> 34:34.242
So here's the plan.
We call a cab,

34:35.000 --> 34:39.324
get some wine,
strawberries, whatever you like...

34:40.920 --> 34:43.685
and we'll go to my place... or yours?

34:44.600 --> 34:47.251
But... maybe we could talk first?

34:49.440 --> 34:50.601
Or something?

34:51.639 --> 34:55.850
The thing is, I'm on a tight schedule.

34:57.320 --> 34:58.606
But thanks.

35:03.280 --> 35:04.406
Kasia?

35:05.640 --> 35:06.640
Dominik.

35:07.200 --> 35:08.645
Here's the plan.

35:08.800 --> 35:12.168
We call a cab, get some strawberries...

35:12.200 --> 35:13.201
Ok.

35:14.440 --> 35:16.249
Well, good evening!

35:16.520 --> 35:18.090
I tell him there's no way.

35:18.240 --> 35:20.242
He says he's on a tight schedule.

35:20.440 --> 35:23.808
And she just left with him.
Incredible.

35:24.440 --> 35:26.010
They were complete strangers.

35:28.080 --> 35:32.404
- "Tight schedule", nice one.
- How is that funny?

35:32.560 --> 35:36.770
It is. And not just to me. Come
to the show tonight, and you'll see.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.404
I've got this.

35:40.360 --> 35:41.725
Gonna take it?

35:41.880 --> 35:44.360
Or do you want to get
to know him first, too?

35:46.000 --> 35:47.889
I'm just wondering if it's a good idea.

35:48.120 --> 35:51.806
Don't be so uptight.
Come over, it's your show too.

35:53.000 --> 35:55.446
- Can I bring a friend?
- Sure.

36:08.880 --> 36:12.965
<i>Wilk's show at 8. Wanna go with me?</i>

36:13.760 --> 36:15.569
<i>DEFINITELY.</i>

36:20.400 --> 36:21.845
Do you mind?

36:30.200 --> 36:31.645
What's up with her?

36:31.840 --> 36:34.081
You're asking me?
She's your wife.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.721
<i>Download Planet Single app
and find your soulmate.</i>

36:43.120 --> 36:44.201
Yeah, sure.

36:45.040 --> 36:46.040
Bullshit.

36:57.520 --> 37:01.206
<i>Swipe right and join the fun.</i>

37:06.840 --> 37:12.244
<i>Planet Single. End your lonely days.
And nights.</i>

37:29.360 --> 37:30.725
<i>Hey, baby.</i>

37:30.760 --> 37:33.001
<i>When will you send me some pics?</i>

37:33.040 --> 37:34.724
Sexy Dad?

37:36.080 --> 37:37.241
What the...

37:42.280 --> 37:45.966
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Just got a message.

37:46.880 --> 37:49.360
- Anything interesting?
- Oh yes, very.

37:53.680 --> 37:56.968
- So you're going out tonight?
- Yes, with Ania.

37:57.680 --> 38:01.651
- Great. Tell her I said “Hi”.
- Don't wait up.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.765
Zoska,

38:24.920 --> 38:26.126
here's the thing.

38:29.840 --> 38:31.842
The thing is...

38:32.640 --> 38:37.601
So I'm supposed to do
this talk with kids

38:38.200 --> 38:40.931
about the dangers of Internet dating.

38:42.840 --> 38:44.285
And...

38:48.000 --> 38:49.843
Do you know what that
Planet Single thing is?

38:50.160 --> 38:54.529
Naturally. It is an established
disease entity:

38:54.600 --> 38:56.523
nymphomania
and should be treated as such.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.604
Do you treat women as well?

38:58.840 --> 39:00.410
- Of course.
- What's the address?

39:02.200 --> 39:04.328
Dominik... where is he?

39:05.840 --> 39:07.410
Why fight it?

39:07.520 --> 39:10.763
Just follow your instincts.

39:11.160 --> 39:14.721
Are you Kasia? Or maybe you?
No, wait, not you.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.085
- Leave them alone!
- How about you? Kasia?

39:20.320 --> 39:22.891
Don't turn away from me.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.606
Give us a kiss.

39:25.880 --> 39:27.609
Leave them alone, please.

39:27.720 --> 39:29.370
Angela is available.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.803
I'm coming, Angela! I adore her!
Have you seen her tits?

39:34.840 --> 39:37.127
Angela, I'm coming!

39:37.560 --> 39:40.245
The DJ was our most complex puppet.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.044
You already know Marcel.

39:42.160 --> 39:44.447
And this is Tomek, but
we call him Forty Winks.

39:44.920 --> 39:48.163
- He once fell asleep during the show.
- He won't let it go.

39:48.360 --> 39:49.885
Hi.

39:52.280 --> 39:55.204
- Looks exactly like him.
- Like whom?

39:55.560 --> 39:58.404
This one guy I know.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.444
You know, you actually look a bit like...

40:04.280 --> 40:06.726
Go get some sleep.
Thanks.

40:10.240 --> 40:11.048
He knows?!

40:11.160 --> 40:14.403
Come on, his synapses last
made contact in October.

40:19.280 --> 40:22.250
Ania tells me you call yourself
a hair psychologist. ls that right?

40:23.640 --> 40:29.522
Ola and I are going to talk hair
and makeup. We might be a while.

40:33.360 --> 40:35.647
- Want to see something cool?
- Yes.

40:38.520 --> 40:40.522
You keep shoes next to the brushes?

40:41.720 --> 40:45.167
Interesting. No one minded it so far.

40:45.280 --> 40:47.282
It's terribly unhygienic.

40:49.200 --> 40:50.690
What's this?

40:51.040 --> 40:56.080
Public TV ordered it for some show, but
figured it was too risque', so we got it.

40:56.440 --> 40:58.124
Their loss, our gain.

40:58.640 --> 41:02.361
Marcel? Jacek needs you.
Something about the coffee machine.

41:04.520 --> 41:06.522
What would they do without me?

41:07.040 --> 41:08.530
Be good.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.686
Enjoy.

41:11.200 --> 41:13.851
<i>I'll</i> be down the hall.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.202
Incredible.

41:36.880 --> 41:38.291
You made them all yourself?

41:38.520 --> 41:40.124
The first few dozen.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.362
Now I have an entire
team to do it for me.

41:43.560 --> 41:44.721
It suits you.

41:52.840 --> 41:55.844
And this was my first puppet.

41:57.200 --> 42:00.044
- How long ago did you make it?
- I don't remember. Simon?

42:04.400 --> 42:06.004
Pardon me!

42:06.320 --> 42:09.210
Tomek? Geez!

42:09.320 --> 42:13.723
When I last saw you, the country
was on food rations.

42:15.720 --> 42:18.849
Oh, a princess.

42:20.320 --> 42:21.890
At your service...

42:25.200 --> 42:28.568
I get this bum started in the business.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.322
And what do I get in return?
A one-way ticket to storage town.

42:33.080 --> 42:36.004
Sorry, he loves pulling at heartstrings.

42:44.200 --> 42:46.089
How did you learn to make those voices?

42:46.240 --> 42:50.245
I never had any friends,
so I had to entertain myself.

42:50.720 --> 42:52.245
And now seriously?

42:52.840 --> 42:54.683
My parents were never home,

42:54.760 --> 42:58.890
and my grandfather was
a kids' show veteran.

42:59.280 --> 43:01.601
I've been playing with puppets
ever since I remember.

43:03.280 --> 43:04.805
Oh, so we're sharing?

43:05.880 --> 43:09.441
So how did you fall in love
with music, princess?

43:11.680 --> 43:14.763
Same old story;

43:15.440 --> 43:19.081
my dad was a composer, when I was
little he'd sit me at the piano

43:19.160 --> 43:20.924
and I could bang on the keys.

43:20.960 --> 43:22.849
The rest is history.

43:23.000 --> 43:27.642
- I even got into a conservatory in Paris.
- Really? Nice.

43:28.160 --> 43:32.085
Dad even bought me a dress
for my first recital.

43:33.560 --> 43:35.164
And? What happened?

43:35.440 --> 43:37.841
He died as I was about to leave.

43:38.520 --> 43:42.002
Mom fell apart. I had to stay.

43:42.360 --> 43:43.771
So stay I did.

43:44.320 --> 43:46.049
Started teaching.
At school.

43:49.120 --> 43:51.122
Sometimes that's just the way
the cookie crumbles.

44:05.440 --> 44:07.920
Sorry, I need to run.

44:11.760 --> 44:13.330
<i>I'll</i> talk to him.

44:20.000 --> 44:22.731
- Where's Marcel?
- In no. 3, I think.

44:23.360 --> 44:27.410
- You really think I'm uptight?
- What?

44:27.600 --> 44:29.602
You called me that.

44:29.920 --> 44:31.922
You make it sound like an insult.

44:32.080 --> 44:37.007
I just meant that perhaps you
could be more spontaneous.

44:42.400 --> 44:44.801
That heartless pervert!

44:45.000 --> 44:48.971
He thinks he can find
someone younger and hotter?

44:50.400 --> 44:55.122
He had such treasure at home,
that hairy lardass.

44:55.960 --> 44:57.962
I could've had anyone...

45:05.880 --> 45:07.609
See? Spontaneous.

45:16.560 --> 45:19.370
<i>I really am sorry. Can you forgive me?</i>

45:21.160 --> 45:24.084
<i>Bitter-Sweet invites for a chat. Accept?</i>

45:27.800 --> 45:29.165
<i>Ania and Bitter-Sweet are a match.</i>

45:33.640 --> 45:35.369
<i>What are you doing?</i>

45:36.400 --> 45:39.131
<i>Nothing. Watching TV.</i>

45:41.720 --> 45:43.768
<i>Most people</i>

45:43.840 --> 45:46.525
<i>would make up something fancy.</i>

45:48.240 --> 45:50.971
<i>Ok, what are you doing then?</i>

45:53.440 --> 45:56.842
<i>Talking to an attractive girl.</i>

45:57.320 --> 45:59.004
<i>Does she know</i>

45:59.040 --> 46:01.611
<i>you're also writing to me?</i>

46:08.400 --> 46:11.244
<i>Your turn. Better to know the date</i>

46:11.280 --> 46:13.726
<i>or the cause of your death?</i>

46:14.800 --> 46:16.165
<i>Cause, obviously.</i>

46:16.240 --> 46:17.651
<i>Would you rather have</i> a

46:17.680 --> 46:19.250
<i>PAUSE or</i> a <i>REWIND button?</i>

46:20.720 --> 46:24.406
<i>Someone already hit PAUSE in my life.</i>

46:26.400 --> 46:28.402
<i>Meaning?</i>

46:29.120 --> 46:31.122
<i>know, I feel stuck.</i>

46:31.160 --> 46:33.686
<i>Do you know what I mean?</i>

46:35.840 --> 46:37.126
<i>I do.</i>

46:37.320 --> 46:39.971
<i>I feel I should be doing something else.</i>

46:40.240 --> 46:42.527
<i>Like I've made a wrong turn.</i>

46:44.280 --> 46:48.001
<i>Do you want to meet?</i>

46:52.240 --> 46:54.242
<i>Maybe someday.</i>

46:54.280 --> 46:57.170
<i>It's good to talk for now.</i>

47:30.600 --> 47:34.161
Oh, sorry.
Would you like some coffee?

47:35.520 --> 47:36.520
Yes.

47:36.800 --> 47:40.043
What kind? Espresso, black, latte?

47:40.240 --> 47:42.083
Yeah, great.

47:48.360 --> 47:51.284
And... what kind do you drink?

47:51.400 --> 47:54.609
Black. Sweet.
Not too sweet, though.

47:55.520 --> 47:57.522
So a bit bitter.

47:59.080 --> 48:02.801
- Yeah, that's coffee for you.
- And life, right?

48:06.520 --> 48:08.204
I don't get it.

48:08.600 --> 48:12.047
I mean that coffee is like life.

48:15.280 --> 48:19.922
I know what you said, but
I don't know what you mean.

48:20.440 --> 48:23.011
That coffee, much like life,

48:23.280 --> 48:25.726
can be bitter and sweet.

48:30.000 --> 48:31.411
Sure.

48:32.000 --> 48:37.245
It's cool when it's sweet,
but sometimes it's bitter.

48:37.360 --> 48:38.885
Bittersweet.

48:39.920 --> 48:41.729
That's what I said.

48:44.080 --> 48:46.526
I have a date.
I need to run.

48:59.160 --> 49:02.801
<i>Olek_36 invites to his planet. Accept?</i>

49:16.720 --> 49:19.121
- Olek?
- No.

49:19.960 --> 49:21.530
Ania?

49:24.120 --> 49:25.565
Good evening.

49:26.240 --> 49:28.083
You look ravishing.

49:28.600 --> 49:31.171
Should we start you off
with an alcoholic beverage?

49:32.720 --> 49:34.131
Excuse me!

49:35.280 --> 49:38.329
- Could I see some ID?
- Certainly.

49:44.360 --> 49:47.364
I'm sorry, but we have a strict
policy against prostitution.

49:51.960 --> 49:54.361
He was this short.
Like that kid.

50:00.720 --> 50:02.051
You little sucker!

50:02.560 --> 50:04.961
<i>Headmaster_110 invites to his planet.</i>

50:07.160 --> 50:11.290
<i>Hey, handsome. Want some sexy pics?</i>

50:14.320 --> 50:19.167
I'm feeling so much pressure from them?
I don't know what to do.

50:19.280 --> 50:22.841
Why don't you simply
tell your parents you're gay?

50:22.920 --> 50:24.729
What? I'm so not gay!

50:29.920 --> 50:30.682
This game is dumb.

50:30.880 --> 50:34.726
Our heroine was rejected
by a beautiful man.

50:34.960 --> 50:39.648
A man with shiny muscles,

50:39.840 --> 50:43.083
sculpted with steel...

50:57.200 --> 50:58.964
<i>Happy Birthday to you...</i>

51:01.520 --> 51:03.921
But it's not my birthday.

51:04.200 --> 51:07.010
They serve free cake if you say it is.

51:19.920 --> 51:22.127
<i>Since I promised...</i>

51:26.400 --> 51:28.209
That bitch!

51:28.400 --> 51:30.880
- What did you call my daughter?
- No, I did not mean...

51:30.960 --> 51:32.291
You heard right.

51:33.640 --> 51:35.768
- Tell your wife to shut up.
- Or what?

51:50.640 --> 51:53.371
Maybe you should quit
while you're ahead.

51:54.000 --> 51:55.406
<i>Jesus. I had no idea</i>

51:55.407 --> 51:57.084
<i>Internet dating was such a minefield.</i>

51:58.880 --> 52:00.769
<i>You need to kiss a lot</i>

52:00.880 --> 52:02.564
<i>of frogs to find a prince. Best of luck.</i>

52:03.320 --> 52:05.322
<i>The day
after tomorrow at 7pm?</i>

52:06.960 --> 52:09.645
<i>The day
after tomorrow at 7pm?</i>

52:10.120 --> 52:11.963
<i>Yep. Rev
up your engine, stud.</i>

52:13.120 --> 52:15.043
<i>Yep. Rev up your engine, stud.</i>

52:15.240 --> 52:17.242
<i>HOW TO GET RID OF A WICKED STEPMOTHER</i>

52:17.280 --> 52:19.282
<i>Tune in tomorrow for more fun!</i>

52:32.880 --> 52:36.930
- I had a reservation, Malinowski.
- Piotr? Hey.

52:37.000 --> 52:42.166
Hey, Ania. Nice to see you.

52:43.040 --> 52:44.724
- This is Oscar.
- Piotr.

52:44.800 --> 52:48.122
- Piotr who?
- Ania's friend from work.

52:49.120 --> 52:50.610
A friend?

52:51.880 --> 52:53.689
You like my girlfriend?

52:53.760 --> 52:55.171
- You'd like to screw her?
- No...

52:55.240 --> 52:57.971
- No? So she's ugly?
- No, she's pretty...

52:58.200 --> 53:00.680
So you DO want to screw her!

53:22.880 --> 53:24.882
<i>Hey, are you there?</i>

53:26.640 --> 53:28.642
<i>Everything OK?</i>

53:32.040 --> 53:36.921
<i>Only the days yet to come
are still important.</i>

53:38.240 --> 53:41.164
<i>The moments we're waiting for
are all that matter.</i>

53:50.520 --> 53:56.163
<i>Hania could succumb to female hysteria
and vaginal redistinction.</i>

53:56.640 --> 53:58.449
What can we do, doctor?
How can we help her?

53:58.640 --> 54:02.087
In our time, when someone went
mad, we just cut their head off.

54:03.000 --> 54:04.684
<i>Or we gave them opium.</i>

54:04.800 --> 54:09.124
Drugs are an option,
but what could we give her?

54:09.200 --> 54:13.569
She's so picky

54:13.720 --> 54:17.884
that her best hope
would probably be a roofie...

54:18.160 --> 54:19.810
<i>lost hope.</i>

54:19.840 --> 54:24.801
<i>Best hope of not dying a virgin that is.</i>

54:25.760 --> 54:28.764
<i>Can you explain how a roofie works?</i>

54:29.000 --> 54:32.163
<i>You stood me up. I waited forever.</i>

54:33.080 --> 54:35.082
This one dulls your senses first.

54:35.320 --> 54:38.324
This one? Let's try it out.

54:39.840 --> 54:43.049
- Wait, that's irresponsible...
- How long before it starts?

54:43.320 --> 54:45.322
<i>And I'll make it up for you</i>

54:45.400 --> 54:46.765
<i>just as long.</i>

54:46.800 --> 54:48.802
<i>Give me a chance?</i>

54:53.920 --> 54:55.922
- What is it?
- What do you think it is?

54:56.120 --> 55:00.682
You should see yourself.
You're glued to all those gadgets.

55:00.760 --> 55:04.731
- I'm talking to someone.
- Oh, that's rich.

55:05.160 --> 55:07.288
That's not talking.
This is talking.

55:07.760 --> 55:10.286
Nowadays this is also talking.

55:10.440 --> 55:12.090
- So who is he?
- I don't know.

55:12.320 --> 55:15.085
You don't know who you're talking to?

55:15.280 --> 55:17.009
I'm trying to figure out.

55:19.200 --> 55:23.808
Ania, he should be trying to figure
you out. Not the other way around!

55:23.920 --> 55:27.163
You won't find anyone of substance
by chasing them.

55:27.360 --> 55:30.842
Your dad never gave up on wooing me
and it was the love of my life.

55:30.920 --> 55:33.241
The right person is someone
who will never give up on you.

55:33.920 --> 55:38.084
That's who you will find
happiness with, not...

55:51.280 --> 55:53.044
What is this trash?!

56:07.320 --> 56:11.120
<i>Dopamine. Tomorrow 8pm. Sharp!</i>

56:28.280 --> 56:30.282
Oh my, I'm late.

56:31.520 --> 56:32.851
Okay, I deserved that.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.810
- Ania.
- Antoni. Or Ant_Man.

56:36.280 --> 56:40.126
That's cleared up then.
But you're not exactly a superhero.

56:43.360 --> 56:46.921
Well, if I was I couldn't tell you.

56:49.360 --> 56:54.048
Maybe I should explain what
happened that evening.

56:55.400 --> 56:56.400
See,

56:56.800 --> 56:59.326
I had my whole day planned.
And then I got a call

56:59.440 --> 57:02.091
from school that my daughter...

57:03.680 --> 57:07.082
Yes, I have a daughter.
Matylda. She's 6.

57:08.280 --> 57:09.770
This is getting interesting.

57:11.000 --> 57:15.130
They called saying that... That she
left school and they can't find her.

57:15.200 --> 57:16.804
You're quite the storyteller.

57:18.400 --> 57:21.643
- You don't believe me.
- No... I do.

57:21.880 --> 57:25.441
I've seen some weird things lately.
Go on.

57:26.000 --> 57:29.721
I looked for her all over,
called everyone, turned out

57:30.640 --> 57:32.802
- she went to the Philharmonic.
- A 6-year-old.

57:33.600 --> 57:37.400
My wife used to sing in
a choir before she passed.

57:37.880 --> 57:40.850
Matylda hasn't been coping well
with her mom's death.

57:42.600 --> 57:44.602
She went to ask about her
mom's next performance.

57:44.680 --> 57:48.366
She doesn't quite understand
mom isn't coming back.

57:52.520 --> 57:54.124
You're not joking?

57:56.600 --> 57:59.126
- I'm so sorry.
- No, I am sorry.

58:01.280 --> 58:05.285
A widowed father... I didn't want
to drop that bombshell right away.

58:05.360 --> 58:09.126
I just wanted to explain
why I couldn't make our first date.

58:09.200 --> 58:11.202
I didn't have your number,
so I couldn't call.

58:11.840 --> 58:14.650
- I'm sorry.
- Come on, it's not...

58:17.560 --> 58:21.406
- How is your daughter now?
- Depends.

58:22.360 --> 58:25.091
The thing is, no one knows how much
she actually understands.

58:25.360 --> 58:27.966
- So her mom sang in a choir?
- Yes.

58:28.200 --> 58:33.331
That's uncanny, because
I teach music to...

58:33.520 --> 58:35.170
I know, I saw it on your profile.

58:35.360 --> 58:38.443
Music can help a lot.
You could sign her up.

58:41.080 --> 58:45.449
So, now that we've got first date
superficial banter out of the way...

58:48.240 --> 58:50.083
- How about...
- Your favorite food.

58:50.240 --> 58:51.605
Lasagne.

58:51.880 --> 58:54.690
Please don't tell me it's yours too.

58:54.840 --> 58:57.969
I didn't say that, because...

58:58.320 --> 59:00.641
my favorite food is kebab.

59:04.040 --> 59:07.931
- Excuse me. Two kebabs please.
- We don't serve kebabs.

59:11.720 --> 59:13.290
In that case we'll need a moment.

59:13.760 --> 59:15.444
And please take these away.

59:29.160 --> 59:31.891
<i>How's life?</i>

59:35.080 --> 59:40.086
<i>Hungry. I had only salad again.</i>

59:41.200 --> 59:43.202
<i>Cooking just now. Come on over.</i>

59:43.400 --> 59:46.006
<i>Isn't it a little late?</i>

59:46.080 --> 59:48.321
<i>10:30pm? How old are you?</i>

59:48.440 --> 59:50.169
- How about...
- Your favorite food.

59:56.680 --> 59:58.682
Seriously?

01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:02.242
<i>I'll</i> take this.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:07.923
- Come on in.
- Should I be scared?

01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:11.445
Would you like a drink?

01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:15.006
Thank you.

01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.603
- Wine.
- White? Red?

01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:22.288
White... red... white...

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:26.404
Just your average bachelor's pad.

01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:29.041
If you find the bathroom, let me know.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:43.722
I haven't listened to this in years.

01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:48.171
Shall we spin it?

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.245
<i>There were so many days
That drained our strength</i>

01:00:55.560 --> 01:01:00.441
<i>There were so many moments
That left us breathless...</i>

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:02.562
I used to play this for my parents.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.604
On the piano.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:08.527
As a child. Every Sunday.

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.842
I'd watch them dance.

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.885
Dying of boredom.

01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:15.562
I was sick of this song.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.725
After dad died, mom
stopped listening to it.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:25.411
And now I'd give anything
to play it for them again.

01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:34.601
- So... tell me about today.
- What about it?

01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:37.567
Your date with the no-show.

01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:43.164
- I don't want to talk about it.
- That bad?

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:45.245
That good.

01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:49.401
Seriously?

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.924
Tell me then.

01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:55.804
I don't want to.

01:01:56.920 --> 01:02:00.208
- Why not?
- Because you'll use it on the show.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.962
Isn't that the deal we made?

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.325
Well, this one might have potential.
I don't want to mess it up.

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.682
Why would I mess it up?

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.002
We're looking for
a boyfriend for you, right?

01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:23.361
- But promise this stays between us.
- Okay,

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:26.684
but you have some more wine.

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:30.844
He was...

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:36.808
charming, handsome, funny...

01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:39.651
- Excuse me...
- Cheerful...

01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:43.691
Isn't this the same guy who left you
waiting in a restaurant for two hours?

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.683
Turns out we have a lot in common.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:49.890
He also loves music and
lost someone close to him.

01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:51.320
Whom?

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:52.960
His wife.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.647
She died of cancer nine
months ago and... it's a sad story.

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.451
That's why he couldn't make it.

01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.801
His daughter ran away from school,
he was looking for her.

01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:08.845
What's with the face?

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.328
- Can't you hear how that sounds?
- How?

01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:15.122
His wife died of cancer.

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.283
And his daughter went missing.

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.522
He showed me pictures.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:21.803
Of his dead wife and escaping kid?

01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:23.928
If you'd lost someone,
you wouldn't be making fun.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.729
A pity I haven't then.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.964
That's not what I meant, I just...

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:33.444
He wasn't lying.

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:35.405
We had a terribly nice time.

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.324
So terrible or nice?

01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:44.528
- So when should I bring the piano?
- What piano?

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:47.241
You fell in love, we had a deal.

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.522
Fell in love? I just had a good time.

01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.920
Ok,

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.091
it's late, I have
a busy day tomorrow.

01:04:01.680 --> 01:04:04.331
But thanks, the food was delicious.

01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.284
<i>I'll</i> find the elevator myself.

01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:33.322
Your face looks like a dog's behind,
if you keep singing, I'll lose my mind!

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.407
Don't listen to him,
your face is beautiful.

01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:43.849
Count out loud.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.322
Five, six, seven...

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.451
- Everything ok?
- <i>It'll</i> heal.

01:04:58.440 --> 01:05:01.649
I'm sorry.
I didn't know he was a jerk.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:06.841
It's ok.
It's sweet that you care.

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.850
I can't imagine how you must have felt.

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:13.722
You're just sitting there, talking,
and suddenly I barge in...

01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:16.765
It must have been a shock.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.810
Hold that thought, <i>I'll</i> be right back
and you'll tell me everything.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:30.563
- Hello.
- We've decided to take your advice.

01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:32.006
I'm glad.

01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:34.122
You must be Matylda.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:36.891
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:40.364
- She's adorable.
- Definitely her mother's genes.

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:45.970
Children, this is our new friend.
Say hello.

01:05:46.120 --> 01:05:48.122
Hi!

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.642
She'll do great.

01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:54.844
- Thanks for bringing her.
- I should be thanking you.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.606
I had fun talking to you,
so I hoped...

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.886
That we could keep talking.

01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.085
Tonight.

01:06:06.840 --> 01:06:08.410
With pleasure.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:12.564
Quiet!

01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.811
- Then <i>I'll</i> see you.
- Good bye!

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.326
What are you doing?

01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:55.126
Go study, read something!

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:05.764
That idiot. <i>I'll</i> show him.
<i>I'll</i> meet someone. I'm still young.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.729
He'll beg me for forgiveness.

01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:16.046
“I'm so sorry, my dear...

01:07:16.240 --> 01:07:17.765
but go fuck yourself.”

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:40.121
<i>For the greatest guy in the world
Your Ola</i>

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.328
- Nice suit.
- Nice indeed.

01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:55.729
You look quite good yourself,
might I add.

01:07:57.200 --> 01:08:00.682
So... have fun with Ania.

01:08:02.040 --> 01:08:03.769
And you with the accountant.

01:08:03.880 --> 01:08:06.167
Oh, I will most definitely
have so much fun.

01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:10.842
Voila. After you.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:14.011
- Age before beauty.
- Ladies first.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.651
- You're in more of a hurry.
- I'll wait.

01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:39.921
I had no idea men could sing opera?

01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.805
Crazy, right?

01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.801
Shocking.

01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.162
I need to tweet about it.

01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:49.649
Something stronger.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.564
Make it a double.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.969
What were we talking about?

01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:01.242
I don't remember. I can't
think now, I have to tweet.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:16.841
- Where are you going?
- Take some selfies, <i>I'll</i> be right back.

01:09:28.720 --> 01:09:30.131
Ania?

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.286
Tomek?

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:36.328
What are you doing here?

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:39.920
You look great. Beautiful.

01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:42.089
You... too.

01:09:42.160 --> 01:09:43.844
- Shall we...?
- Ania!

01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:47.770
I didn't know it is so
hard to get into a club.

01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.727
- Antoni, this is Tomek, my...
- Colleague.

01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:54.601
Do you teach as well?

01:09:54.720 --> 01:09:56.927
- Pardon?
- I asked if you're a teacher.

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:02.084
- No. I'm on television.
- A producer?

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:07.281
Kind of. I have this
talk show with puppets.

01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:09.522
Cool. Sounds exciting.

01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.810
- Unfortunately, I don't watch too much TV.
- What do you do?

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.362
Boring stuff.

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.164
He's a doctor.

01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:19.402
A doctor. Wow.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:22.246
Just a gastroenterologist.
Nothing flashy.

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:25.967
Nothing flashy.
He just saves people's lives.

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.644
So we have something in common.

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:31.690
We both stick our hands
up asses for a living...

01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:36.762
That's true.

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:41.005
So, listen, maybe you could come
to the show the day after tomorrow.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.726
What? We can't.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:46.724
- Why not? Matylda loves puppets.
- Your daughter?

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:48.044
Yes.

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:51.129
Well in that case you must come.

01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.326
Definitely.

01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.762
Are you sure you're free?

01:10:55.840 --> 01:10:57.569
- Yeah. Tomorrow, right?
- The day after.

01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:01.651
The day after... I can't.
I have work.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:03.240
Too bad.

01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:10.760
I should take this. I'll be back
before you can say gastroenterology.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.202
- He's cute.
- What was that?

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.401
What?

01:11:15.520 --> 01:11:18.046
I invited him. To our show.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.966
- You told him about the show, right?
- Of course... not.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:24.724
You're lying to him?

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:27.207
I'm not, I just...

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:29.810
Oh, grow up.

01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.683
Ania, wait.

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:37.887
- Sorry!
- Ok, yeah, enough!

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:49.362
You need to speak up.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:53.884
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
I'm at a club with my friends.

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.042
I know, it's loud.

01:11:58.840 --> 01:12:02.208
No, <i>I'll</i> be very late tonight.
Don't wait up.

01:12:04.120 --> 01:12:06.600
Will you tell mom
good night from me?

01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:11.362
Kisses to you both.
Sleep well.

01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:26.724
Occupied.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.530
Are you gonna use that?

01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:01.329
Surprised, huh?

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:05.641
How could you do this to me, like some...

01:14:06.520 --> 01:14:07.965
whore!

01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:11.202
How could...

01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:14.285
Unbelievable.

01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:18.723
Surprised, huh?

01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.329
No, that's no good...

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:23.967
How could you do this to me?

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.645
You bitch you...

01:14:35.120 --> 01:14:37.122
Surprised?

01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:39.962
How could you do this to me?

01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.242
Like a damn whore.

01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.610
Here you go.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:59.564
- Do you feel like...
- Like murder!

01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:10.922
- Good evening...
- No, thank you.

01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.646
Surprised, huh?
How could you...

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.329
Surprised?! Were you
expecting someone else?

01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:23.691
How could you do this to me
you cheating bastard?!

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.360
Can't you watch porn on the internet
like any other guy?

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:28.289
You want whores to send
you perverted pics?

01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:32.001
- Perverted?
- That's what I'm saying!

01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:38.209
I had to lose my job to learn what
a lying cheating bastard you are.

01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:41.841
Wait a minute...?
You got fired again?!

01:15:43.280 --> 01:15:45.726
Yeah, I was.
Months ago! So what?

01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:49.890
I knew it! Why can't you keep a job?
You're completely irresponsible!

01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:56.242
And you didn't even notice!
You never had any respect for me!

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.004
Respect?!

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:02.241
I can't believe I ever thought you
could be a decent wife!

01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:04.601
Let alone a mother to my child!

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:08.651
You can't even hold onto a job,
let alone a family!

01:16:09.440 --> 01:16:12.364
- Great!
- Great...

01:16:13.640 --> 01:16:17.167
I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to...

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:20.367
- Maybe it's time for me to leave.
- Fine with me.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.245
There's the door.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.450
Welcome to my humble abode.

01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:05.964
Humble? It's cozy.

01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.762
Sorry, it's a bit messy.

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:12.403
You should see our place.

01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:19.524
This is the bathroom, the hall,
and the living room.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.960
Ola?

01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:26.203
I had nowhere to go.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:30.644
- Oh gosh.
- Sure thing, honey. It's no problem.

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:32.730
Bogdan is a pig.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:35.402
A pig.

01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:39.127
- I'm so sorry.
- All men are pigs. Ania!

01:17:39.720 --> 01:17:41.529
Move away from that pig!

01:17:41.720 --> 01:17:43.722
Back to the pigsty you pig!

01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.885
Good night.

01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:51.205
Probably going home to his wife!
Run away, you pig!

01:17:56.240 --> 01:17:59.369
I'm sorry.
Maybe he was a nice little piggy.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:05.930
- What happened?
- Bogdan...

01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:11.604
The man who used to be
so close to my heart...

01:18:13.200 --> 01:18:16.010
it's over.

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.285
Tomek?

01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:52.771
- Octavia.
- Walk with me.

01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:00.168
- Is something wrong?
- The ratings are down.

01:19:00.520 --> 01:19:02.966
- I know, I can expla...
- No, just fix it.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:04.081
Sure.

01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:08.366
Maybe we should reveal Hania's true
identity, while anyone still cares.

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:12.684
I promised her anonymity.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.442
How touching.

01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:28.164
- And?
- We need to boost the ratings.

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.844
Even more? How?

01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.604
I have an idea.

01:19:36.760 --> 01:19:38.250
Are you sure it's the right house?

01:19:38.320 --> 01:19:41.324
No. We spent 8 hours
staking out the wrong house.

01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:43.166
Here we go.

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:47.240
Got you!

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:49.530
- It's like Miami Vice.
- Hush.

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.804
Which one do you want to be?

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:55.682
- <i>I'll</i> be the black one.
- You're so annoying.

01:19:57.400 --> 01:20:02.088
Tell the guys to follow him and report.
Watch out.

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.162
You really want to do this?

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:09.410
Are you blind?
He's a fraud.

01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:16.369
- We're messing with people's lives...
- Ratings won't go up by themselves.

01:20:17.160 --> 01:20:19.891
Your car, your rules.

01:20:25.960 --> 01:20:28.964
I am afraid your husband
has been cheating on you.

01:20:38.440 --> 01:20:40.249
I can't believe this.

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.649
We have proof.

01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.167
I can't believe this.
Not again.

01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.731
So it's not the first time?

01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:54.249
How is it that all these women
fall for his weepy shtick?

01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.085
Who is that whore?

01:20:57.280 --> 01:20:59.647
It doesn't matter.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:06.204
I know! <i>I'll</i> call him...
No, <i>I'll</i> go to him and <i>I'll</i> kill him.

01:21:06.520 --> 01:21:09.842
- Calm down.
- You calm down! <i>I'll</i> cut his balls off!

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:16.130
Darling...

01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:20.727
Darling, go to your room,
I'll be right there.

01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:28.291
- Perhaps...
- You're gay, right?

01:21:28.720 --> 01:21:30.722
Can you rape him for me?

01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:34.080
Excuse me?!

01:21:34.200 --> 01:21:36.806
Here's what we'll do.
I cut his balls off,

01:21:36.960 --> 01:21:39.042
you rape him, and then we kill him.

01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:41.680
- I'm not raping anyone!
- Look,

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:45.324
I have a much better idea.

01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:49.526
- Ladies first.
- You're kidding.

01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:55.725
- Promise you won't murder me?
- And walk back in the dark alone?

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:00.802
- Damn it...
- What?!

01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:02.922
People are sleeping here!
We're sorry!

01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:06.647
- Let me sleep!
- The lady said she's sorry!

01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:11.044
- Do I bother you uninvited?!
- We're both sorry.

01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:29.930
Antoni!

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.087
Here.

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:39.686
- Missed me?
- Very much.

01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:43.923
It's beautiful.

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:49.209
Beautiful women should be
brought to beautiful places.

01:22:53.520 --> 01:22:57.605
- This is the amphitheater where...
- Yes, Joanna used to sing here.

01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:04.085
She used to stand almost exactly
where you are standing now.

01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.690
- Maybe we should leave...
- You don't like it?

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:14.764
No, I do.

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:19.610
It's beautiful, but I think...

01:23:23.560 --> 01:23:26.928
- Not again!
- What the hell...

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:29.122
Bravo, Antoni!

01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:31.970
An Oscar-worthy performance!

01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:37.209
We are here at the amphitheater
for the grand unmasking

01:23:37.440 --> 01:23:39.602
of not one, but two people!

01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:43.890
- The real Hania, and the real Antoni.
- What?!

01:23:43.960 --> 01:23:45.803
Meet Ania,

01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:50.010
the true inspiration for
Hania, and a very close friend of mine.

01:23:50.120 --> 01:23:52.282
- Who is Hania?
- She's a puppet.

01:23:52.560 --> 01:23:56.565
- What's this? Some sort of a show?
- Duh!

01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:58.722
Yes. No!
I don't know what this is.

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:02.640
Ania was brought here
by this man - Antoni Bienczycki

01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:06.402
who is also leading something
of a double life. Right?

01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:07.442
What?

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:14.284
He's the kind of guy who uses sympathy
and deceit to prey on helpless women.

01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:17.803
- What the hell?
- In a moment, my fearless assistant will

01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:24.565
bring out your wife, so she can see
what a lying, cheating asshole you are.

01:24:24.800 --> 01:24:26.723
- Marcel!
- Let me go.

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.120
You whore!

01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.764
Leave me alone!

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:41.130
<i>'</i> Marysia?
- Let go!

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.282
- Antoni? What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:50.607
- Who is this?
- My sister.

01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:55.081
- You married your own sister?
- No, you idiot. My wife is dead.

01:24:55.160 --> 01:24:58.209
You're sleeping with both
my husband and my brother?

01:24:58.880 --> 01:25:02.407
- You lying...
- I'm not sleeping with anyone!

01:25:02.520 --> 01:25:04.775
Just think, if you were
living another life,

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:06.754
you wouldn't get to
experience this...

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:12.765
- Calm her down. Do something!
- What can I do?

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.330
Stop! Quiet!

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:23.649
Thank you very much.

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.766
There's clearly probably been
a big misunderstanding.

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:32.086
Maria is not Antoni's wife,
she's his sister.

01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:35.531
His wife is dead. I'm sorry,
but that's just the way it is.

01:25:35.840 --> 01:25:37.842
This has all been a mistake.

01:25:39.360 --> 01:25:42.682
We didn't mean to cause you distress.

01:25:42.760 --> 01:25:45.206
We apologize, and we're leaving now.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:47.722
Let's go.

01:25:49.400 --> 01:25:51.846
I also am surprised.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.602
Antoni...

01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.680
You are all disgusting.

01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.724
At least it will be a great show!

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:06.202
I'm sorry, Antoni...

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:14.244
How could you?
He's a good man.

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:16.404
I wanted to help...

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.605
Help? You've been using me
all this time.

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:23.807
I was a fool to think
we had an understanding.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:30.121
- Ania wait...
- I don't want to see you again. Ever.

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:32.442
You can't just leave.

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:35.604
- What about the piano?
- I don't give a shit about your piano.

01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:46.202
An interesting evening, I have to say.

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:52.565
But that footage.
Awesome!

01:26:57.600 --> 01:27:02.049
Oh well, good riddance.
Let's go get a drink.

01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:04.722
We've been through some
shit together, eh?

01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:10.207
The community center
in Nidzica, remember?

01:27:11.080 --> 01:27:14.323
And look where we are now.

01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:17.642
Yeah, where are we now?

01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:21.807
This whole thing today

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:25.124
- that wasn't the guy I spent
the last 20 years with.

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.569
I just realized that guy is gone.

01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:37.845
You didn't even say a word
when she sidelined me.

01:27:58.640 --> 01:28:00.642
And he fucked it all up.

01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.890
<i>Doctor Bienczycki, please leave a message.</i>

01:29:11.640 --> 01:29:13.881
Do you wanna talk to mommy?

01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:22.122
Darling...

01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:25.686
When we talk to mommy
it's not exactly what you think.

01:29:25.720 --> 01:29:27.529
I know, daddy.

01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.925
What do you know?

01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:34.091
That mom isn't coming back.

01:30:51.120 --> 01:30:53.930
Ela, sing on, don't mind him.

01:30:55.120 --> 01:30:56.201
One, two, three...

01:30:58.640 --> 01:31:01.962
- I can't.
- Ela, don't run off...

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:09.202
Sounds like a cat being gassed,
oh thank God, silence at last.

01:31:09.240 --> 01:31:10.844
- Watch out!
- What?

01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:14.847
So you think it's funny? Humiliating
girls for the amusement of others?

01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:21.850
You think if you have a show,
an audience, anything goes?

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:24.283
You behave like a little punk.

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:26.402
And you know who likes
little punks? No one!

01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:31.448
If you make fun of my group
one more time, <i>I'll</i> shove this ball

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:35.127
so far up your ass, that before you
get it out, you'll die of constipation.

01:31:38.360 --> 01:31:39.725
Understand?

01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:44.522
What's going on?
Everything okay?

01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:47.921
Yes, everything's okay.
Right, Igor?

01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:51.122
Just peachy.

01:31:52.360 --> 01:31:54.931
Here are your invitations to the recital.

01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.290
Nice.

01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.564
What did you do this time?

01:32:08.680 --> 01:32:10.682
Should we start without him?

01:32:11.880 --> 01:32:13.803
- Play it.
- Good morning.

01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:18.522
- Almost on time.
- Where's Marcel?

01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:21.685
He didn't tell you?
He quit in the morning.

01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.762
Thank God for Jacek.

01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:28.761
This is just the first cut.

01:32:29.120 --> 01:32:30.406
<i>You whore!</i>

01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:40.920
<i>He's the kind of guy who uses sympathy
and deceit to prey on helpless women.</i>

01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:43.162
<i>You're sleeping with my husband?</i>

01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:51.009
<i>Meet Ania, the true inspiration for
Hania, and a very close friend of mine.</i>

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:55.403
<i>An Oscar-worthy performance!</i>

01:32:59.280 --> 01:33:04.650
- But she's not his wife.
- Great, but put in more Springer stuff.

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:08.851
And have the music build up
until the wife appears.

01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:12.003
- She's not his wife.
- Really?

01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.727
Okay. We'll tweak the music.

01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:22.241
Put “Antoni - cheating husband”
at the bottom.

01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:23.925
And send me a copy.

01:33:29.120 --> 01:33:31.122
Hello. Just the TV guide.

01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:35.807
WOLF TO UNMASK THE REAL HANIA

01:33:41.160 --> 01:33:42.571
Your change...

01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:54.000
- Hi, morn.
- Hi.

01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:02.729
And what's this?

01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:05.965
- An invitation.
- To what?

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:09.731
The recital I'm preparing
for the end of school year.

01:34:11.400 --> 01:34:13.129
And the TV guide?

01:34:14.840 --> 01:34:16.842
- What?
- The TV guide.

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.771
How am I supposed to know what's on?

01:34:21.040 --> 01:34:22.769
If you want the TV guide,

01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:27.207
then maybe go out and
buy one yourself.

01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:28.647
Watch your tone.

01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:31.684
Instead of sitting on your ass all day,
watching this drivel.

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:33.762
Is that how you talk to your mother?

01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.362
Mother? Since when?

01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:38.290
I'm the one taking care of you.

01:34:38.400 --> 01:34:42.530
Delivering your mail, buying groceries,
mornings and evenings.

01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:46.042
- I'm like your nursemaid.
- You think I have it easy?

01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:50.290
You think I'm having
the time of my life?!

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.807
Ania? Ania!

01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:04.651
<i>O
New comments: O</i>

01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:16.444
<i>Stop recording this, you brat!</i>

01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:19.603
<i>What did you call my daughter,
you readheaded trollop?!</i>

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:25.761
<i>- Get out! You don't work here anymore!
- That's because I quit! You fascists!</i>

01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:29.321
<i>Let's go, Zoska.</i>

01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:56.285
Dad?

01:35:58.160 --> 01:35:59.844
Are you home?

01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.722
Are you enjoying this?

01:37:08.600 --> 01:37:11.729
You're the most stubborn chick
I've ever met.

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:43.930
Beautiful.

01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:51.365
- We've missed you!
- Good morning, miss.

01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.045
Good morning.

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.723
I thought you wouldn't be back.

01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.450
I didn't really have a choice.

01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:05.166
She's been singing my ear off.

01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:08.762
She practically dragged me here.

01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:12.642
I'm so sorry about what happened...

01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:14.364
Don't be...

01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:19.002
- it woke me up. Your friend...
- He's not my friend.

01:38:19.280 --> 01:38:21.760
Okay, but he was right
about one thing.

01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:26.521
I am a liar.
I've been lying to myself.

01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:32.168
The truth is, I need to find closure
before I can move on.

01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:36.602
I know the feeling.

01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:04.881
- Is anyone working here?
- What will it be?

01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:07.925
- I'd like...
- Tomek Wilczynski?

01:40:08.320 --> 01:40:11.563
Yes. But no autographs today.

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:13.449
<i>I'll</i> show you Faust...

01:40:13.560 --> 01:40:16.211
Hey! The pukemeister!

01:40:48.560 --> 01:40:50.005
Marcel...

01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:55.601
Marcel!

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:03.331
Stop shouting.
What are you doing?

01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:06.410
I've no idea what I'm doing.

01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.843
I don't know what's going on.

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:13.841
Since high school, when you
used to let me copy your answers...

01:41:14.280 --> 01:41:17.409
I just don't know how I could...

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.090
Marcel!

01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:21.562
Don't close the...

01:41:22.720 --> 01:41:26.441
Don't leave me, please!
I won't make it on my own!

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:28.164
<i>Shut the fuck up!</i>

01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:36.128
Why aren't you in my life
when I need you so much!

01:41:36.200 --> 01:41:37.770
Stop yelling!

01:41:41.400 --> 01:41:43.164
Thank you for coming down.

01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:46.887
Ok, just get up, don't be silly.

01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:52.603
I'm so terribly sad.

01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:57.246
I love you so much.

01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:05.003
- I love you too.
- I'm sorry. I did it all wrong.

01:42:06.600 --> 01:42:11.447
- You've done nothing wrong.
- Please forgive me.

01:42:13.160 --> 01:42:14.650
I forgive you. Come on.

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:19.442
Is that Tomek Wilczynski?

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:21.725
I didn't know he was gay.

01:42:22.920 --> 01:42:25.605
Come on, everything will be fine.

01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:34.290
Ania...

01:42:35.120 --> 01:42:37.122
Ania...

01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:43.883
Someone's at the door.
Tell them to go away.

01:42:47.080 --> 01:42:48.844
Is there a fire?!

01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:54.967
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:42:57.800 --> 01:42:59.802
Is Ola here?

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:03.922
Wait, I still don't get it.

01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:07.164
You made two fake profiles
and convinced Ola and Bogdan

01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:11.086
they were talking to each other
when they were actually talking to you?

01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:19.011
I'm impressed. So much planning,
and secrecy... incredible.

01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:22.130
- How did you pull it off? It's...
- Ania...

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:27.049
I'm off to school.

01:43:31.200 --> 01:43:32.804
Good luck.

01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:47.011
So the joke's over. You can
come back home now, right?

01:43:50.840 --> 01:43:52.126
Not really.

01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:00.645
- But I'm sorry. I didn't want to...
- Stop it.

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.924
It's not your fault.

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:10.561
You just helped us realize that things
had been off for quite a while, and...

01:44:13.080 --> 01:44:16.323
- We're simply not a good match.
- But you are.

01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.884
We were happy.

01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:21.962
I'm not much of a mother anyway.

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:28.690
So you're just giving UP?

01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:33.089
Kids! Slight change of plans.

01:45:33.320 --> 01:45:34.970
Pass these around.

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.161
Piotr...

01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:44.321
- I need your help.
- Calm down.

01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:45.202
What's up?

01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:48.045
Are you still in that band?

01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.731
We jam sometimes.

01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:53.686
I need them, and you, and all of you.

01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:56.242
And most of all, you Igor.

01:45:56.440 --> 01:45:58.920
Come on.

01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:00.851
Let's go.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:02.968
Don't be scared.
Be a man.

01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:33.411
Marcel. I thought you quit.

01:46:33.520 --> 01:46:38.651
- I wouldn't miss the season finale.
- Yeah, It's going to be sensational.

01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:41.202
Octavia was looking for you.

01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:43.365
Again?

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:48.090
"Get me that bald-headed idiot".
Figured she meant you.

01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:56.682
We have these inside jokes, you know...

01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:01.127
But we're starting in a moment.

01:47:02.240 --> 01:47:04.288
I can run the intro for you.

01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:06.886
You'll be back by the end
of the monologue.

01:47:07.000 --> 01:47:09.207
Ok, I'll be right back.

01:47:23.560 --> 01:47:25.847
- How much time do we have?
- 30 seconds.

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:29.402
- Great. Here you go.
- What's this?

01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:30.846
A slight change of plans.

01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:35.362
Oh, how I missed this.

01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:41.646
The mixing chamber is empty.

01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:44.002
Releasing the lock...

01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:49.366
It is time to start in 3, 2, 1... applause!

01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:58.323
Tomek! Tomek!

01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:10.962
Hania! Hania!

01:48:12.520 --> 01:48:16.570
The season finale!
Incredible.

01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:20.162
I never thought I'd make it this far.

01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:23.722
I remember we started out
years ago with my friend,

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:27.208
doing puppet shows in
a local community center.

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:30.250
Who remembers what
a community center is?

01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:36.011
In our case, it was where drunk
plumbers yelled “show us your tits!”.

01:48:39.720 --> 01:48:41.722
Here I am.

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:44.082
Obviously.

01:48:45.920 --> 01:48:49.208
- You wanted to talk to me.
- No.

01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:52.844
Damn it.

01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:58.528
<i>Suddenly I get</i> a <i>call from
Rafa! Wolski.</i>

01:48:58.760 --> 01:49:00.967
<i>Rafal freaking Wolski!</i>

01:49:01.720 --> 01:49:06.442
He saw me perform and invited me
to his show. My first TV appearance.

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.204
Rafal. thanks for then,

01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:10.204
and sorry for now.

01:49:10.920 --> 01:49:13.446
Incredible.
That was 5 years ago.

01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:16.570
Now I'm standing in the same studio,

01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:21.285
and you could say I finally
have what I wanted.

01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:26.362
But not what I needed.

01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:35.449
- Ania, come see this.
- Yes. Thank you very <i>much.</i>

01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:38.564
<i>Yes, last night I got my ass kicked.</i>

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:40.684
And you know what?

01:49:41.920 --> 01:49:43.729
That's exactly what I needed.

01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:48.285
I made fun of real people who...

01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:53.371
Man...

01:49:55.120 --> 01:49:59.728
People who were braver than me,
because they weren't scared of failure...

01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:02.049
People who were looking for love,

01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:06.961
and the funny thing is -
some of them found it.

01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.650
See for yourselves.

01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:14.001
- My name is Mikolaj.
- Edyta.

01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:17.522
I came here with the real Hania once.

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:20.522
On an Internet date.

01:50:21.080 --> 01:50:23.924
The date was just awful.

01:50:24.320 --> 01:50:26.527
We didn't click.
She was too out of style.

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:27.801
But she was right.

01:50:27.880 --> 01:50:31.123
I went home and told my family I'm...

01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.531
Gay.

01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:36.328
But a moment later I met...

01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:38.889
my treasure.

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:44.522
<i>She was afraid to commit,
at first, but eventually...</i>

01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:45.840
Leave it.

01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:52.684
Karolina enchanted me with
her vitality, beauty, and personality...

01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:56.646
What are you staring at?!
He's my man!

01:50:57.240 --> 01:50:59.925
He says I relax him.

01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:03.846
- He likes visiting me at work.
- Because she makes great coffee.

01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:06.602
Later, I met Gertruda.

01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:10.209
When she stepped through the door,
her hair blowing in the breeze.

01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:12.322
- <i>So modern and stylish...</i>
- Ania!

01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:14.767
I cut that woman's hair!

01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:22.124
<i>I yelled at that hairdresser, but
because of her I met the love of my life.</i>

01:51:22.680 --> 01:51:25.604
- <i>I 'd like to thank her.</i>
- <i>Look, it's</i> mom's <i>client.</i>

01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:30.089
<i>Ola, you're a true artist.
Thank you.</i>

01:51:30.120 --> 01:51:33.169
<i>I was looking for you, but I guess
you only work with stars now.</i>

01:51:33.920 --> 01:51:35.763
Hugs and kisses.

01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:37.882
You just called her “mom”.

01:51:39.560 --> 01:51:41.562
No I didn't.

01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:48.404
It's cool. We care for each other,
trust each other...

01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:53.451
Stop it.

01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:13.121
Mother!

01:52:15.240 --> 01:52:19.529
- And you? Are you single?
- Not now, mom...

01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:24.008
Ask the nice man for his number...

01:52:34.360 --> 01:52:37.284
I didn't believe one could find love,
especially on the Internet.

01:52:37.760 --> 01:52:39.762
I still can't believe
what they just said.

01:52:40.280 --> 01:52:43.602
<i>But I realized my mistake.</i>

01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:47.683
I was always focused on
why things didn't work.

01:52:47.760 --> 01:52:51.048
Then I realized that instead
of looking for someone ideal,

01:52:51.680 --> 01:52:53.682
I should look for someone

01:52:55.560 --> 01:52:58.609
who makes up for my deficiencies.

01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:02.726
The thing about the real Hania is
she's not perfect either.

01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:07.090
<i>She's annoying, neurotic,
she talks way too much</i>

01:53:07.680 --> 01:53:10.604
<i>and she's the sloppiest
eater I have ever seen</i>...

01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:14.203
But she's not afraid to be herself.

01:53:15.160 --> 01:53:17.640
And she knows better than me
that in life you should fight

01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:19.682
not for what you want,

01:53:21.320 --> 01:53:22.731
but for what you need.

01:53:26.360 --> 01:53:30.570
If you had told me this 6 months ago,
I'd laugh at you.

01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:33.082
But now I'll say it from this stage:

01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:38.361
honesty takes guts.

01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:41.727
And not everyone
has what it takes.

01:53:42.400 --> 01:53:44.402
People like Hania do.

01:53:45.720 --> 01:53:49.122
to mock others.

01:53:50.160 --> 01:53:54.768
But I never had the courage
to stop pretending.

01:53:58.280 --> 01:53:59.964
And that's why I'm alone.

01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:06.283
So you want to know
who the real Hania is?

01:54:09.320 --> 01:54:10.560
She's right in front of you.

01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:14.603
You pass her on the subway,
in the hallway,

01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:18.127
maybe she works at your office,
maybe she lives next door.

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:22.161
It's someone you overlooked,
second-guessed, or mistreated.

01:54:22.520 --> 01:54:26.525
You will notice her once you
stop thinking only about yourself.

01:54:28.680 --> 01:54:33.163
So I want to ask you all.
You, my audience...

01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:36.524
Take a look around.

01:54:37.800 --> 01:54:39.802
Don't do what I did.

01:54:41.320 --> 01:54:42.924
Don't blow it.

01:54:44.320 --> 01:54:47.210
Because you may find yourself
in an empty house,

01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:49.691
all alone.

01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:56.969
So that was that.
Good luck.

01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:12.522
INVITATION

01:55:35.720 --> 01:55:39.930
<i>Headmaster_110 invites to his planet.</i>

01:56:08.240 --> 01:56:10.004
Beautiful, isn't it?

01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:15.170
Delivered this morning.
No sender.

01:56:16.720 --> 01:56:18.722
Probably some foundation, right?

01:56:23.800 --> 01:56:26.406
HAVE A GREAT PERFORMANCE

01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:02.123
- Hello, headmaster.
- Come on in...

01:57:10.760 --> 01:57:15.527
- I'm glad you came.
- Good evening. Headmaster, I presume?

01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:18.001
Uh...

01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:20.684
Headmaster_110?

01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:26.281
Yes. Yes, of course.

01:57:26.560 --> 01:57:29.291
And you must be FlirtyGirl.

01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:31.443
Nice to meet you.

01:57:31.600 --> 01:57:33.364
<i>I'll</i> tell you one thing.

01:57:33.600 --> 01:57:38.242
Your profile picture
doesn't do you justice.

01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:41.444
Dad, I need to...

01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:43.811
Oh, you have a daughter?

01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:47.242
Yes. This is my daughter...
Her name is...

01:57:48.240 --> 01:57:49.321
Zoska.

01:57:57.760 --> 01:57:59.285
<i>I'll</i> show you to your seats.

01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:02.125
Just so you know, you're
grounded for a year for this.

01:58:51.760 --> 01:58:54.411
There were so many <i>days</i>

01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:58.090
<i>That drained our strength</i>

01:58:59.720 --> 01:59:06.205
<i>There were so many moments
That left us breathless</i>

01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:10.051
<i>When you regret those</i>

01:59:10.400 --> 01:59:13.722
<i>That gave you nothing but grief</i>

01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:17.204
<i>Just realize this,</i>

01:59:18.120 --> 01:59:21.329
<i>Just remember that</i>

01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:29.203
<i>Only the days yet to come
are still important.</i>

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:37.564
<i>The moments we're waiting for
are all that matter.</i>

01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:45.128
<i>Only the days yet to come
are still important.</i>

01:59:47.040 --> 01:59:50.362
<i>The moments we're waiting for
are all that matter.</i>

01:59:54.520 --> 01:59:58.923
<i>The world can be a better place,
be brave - make up for your mistakes.</i>

01:59:59.160 --> 02:00:04.451
<i>There's still time in the universe.
change yourself first.</i>

02:00:05.080 --> 02:00:10.041
<i>There's no point weeping, no point crying
Think about it and stop denying</i>

02:00:10.200 --> 02:00:12.771
<i>Don't live in the past,
the future can be better</i>

02:00:12.840 --> 02:00:15.081
<i>Only the days ahead of us matter!</i>

02:00:15.560 --> 02:00:20.521
<i>There was a successful man
Who had everything he desired</i>

02:00:20.760 --> 02:00:26.005
<i>But one day lost his way
On the twisting road of life.</i>

02:00:26.160 --> 02:00:30.688
<i>Though his fortune was gone
He listened to his heart</i>

02:00:32.040 --> 02:00:37.922
<i>And never gave up hope, because...</i>

02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:50.125
<i>Only the days yet to come
are still important.</i>

02:00:51.520 --> 02:00:55.605
<i>The moments we're waiting for
are all that matter.</i>

02:00:56.920 --> 02:01:00.891
<i>Only the days yet to come

02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:06.205
<i>Only the days yet to come
are still important.</i>

02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:15.850
<i>How can you see those you know
with fresh eyes?</i>

02:01:16.520 --> 02:01:19.330
<i>How do you collect your thoughts</i>

02:01:20.040 --> 02:01:22.930
<i>when they've been scattered?</i>

02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:30.245
<i>How do you find in yourself
The strength to carry on?</i>

02:01:31.160 --> 02:01:34.243
Search for <i>the</i> answers

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.971
<i>There is always time, because...</i>

02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:46.810
<i>Only the days yet to come

02:01:48.120 --> 02:01:51.966
<i>The moments we're waiting for
are all that matter.</i>

02:02:40.680 --> 02:02:42.682
I liked your singing.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.002
Forgive me.

02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:32.883
- Thanks, bye.
- Bye.

02:03:37.840 --> 02:03:40.923
- Friend of yours?
- Mom...

02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:30.450
<i>Maybe it's time to meet?</i>

02:04:30.520 --> 02:04:31.885
<i>Hey, where'd you 99?</i>

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:33.684
<i>I hope I didn't scare you off?</i>

02:04:33.720 --> 02:04:35.006
<i>OK, I'll write for both of us</i>

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:36.610
<i>This is Ania, how's life.</i>

02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:37.766
<i>I'm missing you BitterSweet.</i>

02:04:37.800 --> 02:04:39.290
<i>You know BitterSweet, when I'm ready</i>

02:04:39.320 --> 02:04:40.845
<i>to meet I'll let you know right away.</i>

02:04:40.880 --> 02:04:42.291
<i>Three weeks since the last message.</i>

02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:48.282
<i>Tomorrow 8pm at Café Rynek.</i>

02:04:48.320 --> 02:04:50.322
<i>Hope I recognize you.</i>

02:05:13.640 --> 02:05:15.881
water and breadsticks?

02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:20.120
- Still waiting for someone.
- My breath is bated.

02:06:10.440 --> 02:06:11.930
Piotr?

02:06:14.080 --> 02:06:15.889
Who the fuck is Piotr?

02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:18.725
Jerk!

02:06:19.120 --> 02:06:21.168
You were pretending to be
BitterSweet all this time!

02:06:21.200 --> 02:06:23.168
- I wasn't pretending.
- A bas clef?!

02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:27.046
I thought you'd like it!
I thought it would be romant..

02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:30.521
Marcel!

02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:41.090
Coming, Your Lowness.

02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:44.082
What the hell are you doing?
Give me a hand!

02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:52.125
Mount up!

02:06:52.400 --> 02:06:55.165
- Help me up!
- Sure, Your Fierceness...

02:06:56.400 --> 02:06:57.731
Away!

02:06:58.880 --> 02:07:02.407
Minstrels!
Follow them! Romantically!

02:07:07.320 --> 02:07:14.204
How can you be such a stubborn,
annoying, stuck-up chick,

02:07:14.240 --> 02:07:16.766
- Me stubborn?
- And not understand that if

02:07:16.880 --> 02:07:22.444
I make a fool of myself in front of
all these people, trying to appologize

02:07:22.560 --> 02:07:29.330
it's not to make fun of you,
but to say that...

02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:31.602
I love you!

02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:33.401
You what?

02:07:44.560 --> 02:07:47.040
Did he just say that he loved me?
