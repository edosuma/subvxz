00:19.119 --> 00:21.019
It's alive!

00:35.702 --> 00:36.828
Aah!

00:39.439 --> 00:43.535
This is me, and this is Seth Green.

00:43.576 --> 00:45.237
We're married.

00:49.916 --> 00:51.577
Hey! Kool-aid!

00:51.618 --> 00:53.142
Oh, you... oh!

00:53.186 --> 00:54.915
Oh, no!

01:00.760 --> 01:02.625
We need Voltron!

01:02.662 --> 01:05.790
Right away. Voltron Force, assemble!

01:05.832 --> 01:07.197

- Voltron!

01:11.871 --> 01:13.964
Oh, shake it, baby!

01:14.007 --> 01:15.804
Oh, yeah!

01:18.144 --> 01:20.169
Keith, the enemy ships are falling back.

01:22.482 --> 01:23.574
Head's up, team.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.849
- Better form Voltron.
- Right!

01:35.562 --> 01:37.860
Pidge, get off!

01:42.402 --> 01:43.994
He's holding a weapon!

01:47.040 --> 01:48.302
Let me see you work it, work it

01:48.341 --> 01:49.467
- Huh?
- Huh?

01:49.509 --> 01:50.669
Watch you work it, work it

01:50.710 --> 01:52.371
Back again, it's the robobeast digger

01:52.412 --> 01:54.403
Can't stop bling, can't stop trigger finger

01:54.447 --> 01:56.244
Throw away the law,
no rhyme on his money spit

01:56.282 --> 01:58.307
Cristal bangin', and my paper
keep the honeys grinnin'

01:58.351 --> 02:00.148
We just got served, team.

02:00.186 --> 02:02.154
- Voltron, represent!
- Voltron, represent!

02:03.490 --> 02:07.324
Why are you gonna front like a punk
that's got that steel?

02:07.360 --> 02:10.852
You dat bitch stick your ass on the block
tryin' to pay those bills

02:10.896 --> 02:12.194
Now drop this bass

02:12.232 --> 02:14.530
Six hour force on to get work
like Heartbreak Ridge

02:14.567 --> 02:15.795
I'm-a punk yo face

02:15.835 --> 02:18.326
Wipin' up your blood with the panties

Work it out

02:32.152 --> 02:33.983
Back to yo ass, put a dent in a robot

02:34.020 --> 02:35.885
Want a wish, get a vacuum robot

02:35.922 --> 02:37.787
Shock to the dome,
put a block in a robot

02:37.824 --> 02:39.689
Six feet under in the grave
with a robot

02:39.726 --> 02:42.024
Ho ho ho ho ho

02:42.061 --> 02:43.153

Work it out

02:52.772 --> 02:54.330
Let me see you work it, work

02:54.374 --> 02:56.308
Get on the floor and work it, work it

02:56.342 --> 02:58.173
Are you ever gonna work it, work it?

02:58.211 --> 03:00.008
Come on, man, just work it out

03:00.046 --> 03:01.877
Let me see you work it, work it

03:01.915 --> 03:03.780
I wanna watch you work it, work it

03:03.816 --> 03:06.114
Here's a dollar, now work it, work it

03:06.152 --> 03:07.949
Just work it out

03:09.088 --> 03:11.056
Come on, man, just work it out

03:11.090 --> 03:12.717
We're out of moves!

03:12.759 --> 03:14.693
Time for a desperation measure, team.

03:22.268 --> 03:26.432
Served! Served!
Served! Served! Served! Served!

03:26.472 --> 03:29.202
Served! Served! Served! Served!

03:29.242 --> 03:31.472
Served! Served! Served!

03:35.014 --> 03:38.450
Hey, who's laughing now, bi-otch?
Huh? Huh?

03:38.484 --> 03:42.215
And in other news tonight,
Voltron got totally served.

03:43.356 --> 03:45.824
Damn!

03:53.967 --> 03:58.404
This is me, and this is Stalin.

03:58.438 --> 03:59.928
We're married.

04:01.140 --> 04:04.234
- I hope you brought protection.
- Yeah. You are so hot.

04:04.277 --> 04:05.369
Get in here.

04:11.284 --> 04:14.185
The mongoose may be small...

04:14.220 --> 04:17.451
but he's one of the fiercest killers
in the animal kingdom.

04:27.667 --> 04:30.864
When the mongoose
finally spots its target...

04:30.903 --> 04:34.669
the strike is precise and deadly.

04:39.379 --> 04:40.368
The president has been shot.

04:40.413 --> 04:43.075
Repeat.
The president has been shot.

04:52.125 --> 04:56.494
No animal is immune
from the tormenting cackle of the hyena.

05:07.006 --> 05:09.338
Look at him! He was so friggin' fat.

05:15.448 --> 05:16.642
Some king of the jungle.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.582
He needs a mouse to help.

05:21.521 --> 05:22.783
Uh-oh.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.017
Ow! Ow! OK!

05:25.058 --> 05:27.458
Ow! Ow! Aah!

05:29.495 --> 05:32.362
Uh, yes, hi.

05:32.398 --> 05:34.332
I'd like to report a domestic disturbance.

05:34.367 --> 05:36.198
But I didn't do anything!

05:36.235 --> 05:38.965
Officer, no!
He never laid a paw on me.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.303
I swear! You... You can't!

05:44.310 --> 05:46.710
So... single, huh?

06:00.526 --> 06:03.893
Truly, the lemming is nature's retard.

06:08.901 --> 06:10.835
To freedom!

06:11.838 --> 06:13.305
Let's go back to your place.

06:13.339 --> 06:14.601
Do you have any condoms?

06:14.640 --> 06:16.801
Who needs condoms?

06:21.981 --> 06:24.848
Patty cake, patty cake, baker's man.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.375
Ow! Ow! A little help?

06:28.588 --> 06:33.753
The year is 1966,
and Walt Disney is dead.

06:33.793 --> 06:38.287
The beloved cartoonist, movie maker,
and hero to the American family...

06:38.331 --> 06:41.767
left specific instructions
to be carried out upon his death.

06:41.801 --> 06:43.894
OK. Do it.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.840
Did he really say
this should be done with a chainsaw?

06:52.879 --> 06:55.040
Never question him.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.946
The public would never know...

06:56.983 --> 07:02.080
what mad experiments took place
under the Matterhorn that day.

07:06.793 --> 07:07.919
Did it work?

07:10.797 --> 07:15.131
I... hunger!

07:15.168 --> 07:18.501
Bring in the first Cuban child.

07:21.174 --> 07:24.143
Walt Disney must feed!

07:24.177 --> 07:25.769
No! No! No, no! No, no!

07:25.812 --> 07:28.576
Yes. Yes!

07:29.816 --> 07:30.976
Yes!

07:34.620 --> 07:38.420
As the years went by,
Disney's power would grow.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.256
He demanded a Disney park
be built in Florida...

07:41.294 --> 07:44.024
so he could be closer
to his Cuban food supply.

07:50.436 --> 07:52.666
Sir, I need your approval
on these expansion plans.

07:52.705 --> 07:54.536
Busy! Eating!

07:54.574 --> 07:57.202
You didn't see anything! You got that?

07:57.243 --> 07:59.040
God help me! Ohh!

07:59.078 --> 08:00.170
Aw...

08:01.314 --> 08:04.283
Walt Disney's lust
for the flesh of Cuban children...

08:04.317 --> 08:08.185
was kept under control
until one fateful day.

08:08.221 --> 08:12.988
The long journey of Elian Gonzales
has finally come to a close.

08:13.025 --> 08:17.655
After being taken by federal agents
from his temporary home in Miami...

08:17.697 --> 08:21.360
little Elian has been reunited
with his family in Cuba.

08:21.400 --> 08:24.699
Elian? Elian!

08:24.737 --> 08:26.830
No! No!

08:26.873 --> 08:28.841
- No! Stop, sir!
- Aah!

08:28.875 --> 08:30.740
Aah!

08:30.776 --> 08:34.268
Elian!

08:49.562 --> 08:52.156
<i>Andale! Andale! Arriba! Arriba!</i>

08:55.935 --> 08:57.527
Uhh!

08:57.570 --> 08:58.662
Unh!

09:04.210 --> 09:05.700
Ahh!

09:07.880 --> 09:10.610
Yaah!

09:12.852 --> 09:15.480
Elian!

09:25.331 --> 09:26.821
Here I am.

09:26.866 --> 09:28.333
Elian?

09:28.367 --> 09:33.600
If it will stop the devastation
on my beloved Cuban people...

09:33.639 --> 09:36.631
I will sacrifice myself to you.

09:36.676 --> 09:37.802
Ahh!

09:38.811 --> 09:40.540
Die, American beast!

09:40.580 --> 09:42.343
Aah!

09:45.885 --> 09:49.946
We must always remember
the sacrifices made today...

09:49.989 --> 09:51.854
by the brave Cuban soldiers...

09:51.891 --> 09:54.587
whose deaths
will not be known outside of Cuba...

09:54.627 --> 09:56.720
thanks to the American embargo.

09:58.331 --> 10:01.061
I love doing that.

10:05.004 --> 10:09.100
Trash. Trash. Not mine. Garbage.
Garbage. Not mine. Ooh! We'll take that.

10:12.478 --> 10:14.241
Huh.

10:22.755 --> 10:24.222
Eee!

10:24.256 --> 10:26.121
I got it! I got it! Ohh!

10:26.158 --> 10:28.183
Uhh!

10:28.227 --> 10:29.592
To be... ooh!

10:29.629 --> 10:31.358
Ohh!

10:31.397 --> 10:32.659
Unh!

10:32.698 --> 10:35.064
Ooh!

10:35.101 --> 10:36.659
Unh!

10:37.837 --> 10:39.532
Uhh!

10:41.474 --> 10:42.634
Ow!

10:42.675 --> 10:44.734
Hey!

10:44.777 --> 10:46.074
- Ow!
- Ooh!

10:46.112 --> 10:47.170
- Ahh!
- Uhh!

10:47.213 --> 10:50.114
Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!

10:52.151 --> 10:54.551
- Ooh!
- Aah!

10:58.691 --> 11:00.056
Unh!

11:03.562 --> 11:07.123
Thank you.
Thank you all so much... ohh!

11:07.166 --> 11:09.361
Oh-ho!

11:22.214 --> 11:24.307
- Ba-gawk!
- Bock.
