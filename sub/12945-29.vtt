10:34.967 --> 10:37.967
That's why I scheduled a snowboarding
lesson for us tomorrow.

10:38.633 --> 10:39.934
-Snowboarding?
-Mm-hmm.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.000
But we don't even live near snow.

10:42.066 --> 10:43.834
I know, that's why
we'll get an early start.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.100
I have school.

10:47.500 --> 10:50.033
[CHUCKLES] You know something?
When I was your age,

10:50.100 --> 10:52.700
I would have loved
an opportunity like this.

10:52.767 --> 10:56.200
It's adventuresome,
it's life-affirming, it's fun.

10:56.400 --> 10:58.433
Grandma, how can I put this? But, I...

10:59.233 --> 11:00.934
I have responsibilities.

11:01.033 --> 11:02.734
I could write you a little note.

11:05.266 --> 11:06.266
Sorry.

11:07.133 --> 11:11.333
Oh, well. Okay, let's eat.
Food's getting cold.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.300
Actually I'm not so hungry after all.

11:23.700 --> 11:24.767
Let me get this straight.

11:24.834 --> 11:26.433
You ate ice cream for dinner,

11:26.500 --> 11:28.000
stayed up way past your bedtime

11:28.100 --> 11:29.533
and then had pizza for breakfast?

11:29.633 --> 11:30.700
Mm-hmm.

11:31.200 --> 11:32.900
Yep, life is good.

11:33.066 --> 11:34.066
What about your grandma?

11:34.166 --> 11:35.867
I'm sure she's still at her
snowboarding lesson.

11:37.467 --> 11:39.533
Snowboarding?
Okay, your grandma's fearless.

11:39.633 --> 11:42.433
It's like she's doing all these things
that I wish I could do.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.667
Big difference, Miranda.
You're a teenager and she's old.

11:45.734 --> 11:47.834
Shouldn't she be knitting
and playing bingo

11:47.967 --> 11:49.800
instead of worrying about her "chi."

11:49.867 --> 11:51.333
Aren't you the guy
who thinks that we should

11:51.400 --> 11:53.500
all be individuals
and not follow the herd?

11:53.600 --> 11:55.734
Yeah, she's just making
life interesting.

11:55.834 --> 11:58.266
But it's like I'm the grownup
and she's the kid.

11:58.333 --> 12:00.266
Isn't she supposed to be
baby-sitting me?

12:01.033 --> 12:03.166
Well, since you are acting
like such a baby...

12:03.734 --> 12:05.233
So you actually want a baby-sitter?

12:05.333 --> 12:08.033
No. I just want to know
that she's there for me

12:08.100 --> 12:09.266
the way she used to be.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.834
[GULPS] Ah!

12:21.533 --> 12:24.333
It was good. So what was that, anyway?

12:24.467 --> 12:26.400
If I told you, then it wouldn't
be a surprise.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.600
And he'd probably crush me.

12:28.767 --> 12:31.133
I am the Leftover king!

12:31.200 --> 12:35.900
-Praise me or be doomed forever!
-[LIZZIE CHUCKLES]

12:37.433 --> 12:39.567
Okay, ready for Mom and Dad
to get better now.

12:41.734 --> 12:46.166
Now the world's fastest
roller-skating champion,

12:46.233 --> 12:50.066
[SCREAMS] Leftover King Matt McGuire!

12:51.667 --> 12:53.533
Whoa! [SCREAMS]

12:56.266 --> 12:58.100
-What was that?
-[SAM SNEEZES]

13:00.300 --> 13:01.567
I should go check on the kids.

13:03.400 --> 13:04.433
Kids?

13:06.100 --> 13:07.233
[GASPS]

13:07.600 --> 13:10.200
Maybe, just... just...

13:10.800 --> 13:12.233
...wait. [SNEEZES LOUDLY]

13:13.433 --> 13:14.467
Are you okay?

13:17.767 --> 13:20.266
Matt the Invincible is A-Okay!

13:20.600 --> 13:23.000
He's also getting kind of a-nnoying.

13:23.166 --> 13:26.066
Do you know what I need?
More cushions!

13:27.266 --> 13:28.934
-[WHEEL SCREECHES]
-[CRASHING]

13:30.667 --> 13:32.533
-[DOORBELL RINGING]
-I'll get it.

13:34.467 --> 13:35.533
Hey, come in.

13:35.633 --> 13:38.533
Hi, sweetheart. I'm looking
for Gordo. Have you seen him?

13:38.667 --> 13:41.000
Um, not since school.
I'm sure he's okay, though.

13:41.066 --> 13:43.233
Don't worry. He's probably
at the library studying or something.

13:43.367 --> 13:45.467
What, me worry? Oh, no, not me.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.533
-[LAUGHS] Come on in.
-Okay.

13:48.200 --> 13:49.533
Oh...

13:51.667 --> 13:54.300
What a nice home you have.

13:54.400 --> 13:56.000
Oh, um, I'd invite you to sit down

13:56.133 --> 13:58.834
but my little brother stole
all the cushions off the couch.

13:58.934 --> 14:00.967
And your parents don't mind?

14:01.367 --> 14:02.400
They don't know.

14:02.567 --> 14:05.300
Um, actually, they don't know.

14:06.333 --> 14:11.333
MATT: Incoming!
Whee! Whee!

14:11.467 --> 14:13.333
[CHUCKLES]

14:13.467 --> 14:15.100
He seems to be having fun.

14:15.200 --> 14:17.367
It's nice to be so young
and so carefree.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.700
-[CHUCKLES]
-That's one way to look at it.

14:20.367 --> 14:23.767
It's... It's funny.
Now that I'm all grown up,

14:23.834 --> 14:25.633
I'm finally getting
to be a kid myself.

14:25.767 --> 14:26.767
What do you mean?

14:26.834 --> 14:29.633
Well, I know Gordo thinks
I'm out on a limb these days.

14:30.467 --> 14:33.000
Ever since I was a little bit older
than you are,

14:33.066 --> 14:35.467
I had a list of things
I wanted to do...

14:35.567 --> 14:39.800
Like see the Sistine Chapel up close,
climb mountains,

14:39.867 --> 14:42.367
or learn to dance like Ginger Rogers.

14:43.533 --> 14:44.567
Ginger who?

14:44.767 --> 14:48.233
[CHUCKLES] Consider her the Britney
of my generation.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.667
Mm. [CHUCKLING]

14:49.734 --> 14:51.133
I've been very lucky in my life.

14:51.734 --> 14:55.133
I was blessed with a beautiful,
healthy family,

14:55.800 --> 14:57.834
but now that my children are grown

14:57.900 --> 15:01.367
and have families of their own,
I'm not needed much now.

15:01.800 --> 15:05.066
So I finally have the time
to do all the things on my list.

15:07.734 --> 15:08.934
It's funny, you know?

15:09.033 --> 15:11.200
My grandmother
likes to do crazy stuff, too.

15:11.734 --> 15:13.100
She loves to go windsurfing

15:13.166 --> 15:15.734
and she likes to go gambling
with her girlfriends

15:15.800 --> 15:17.367
but when it's just the two of us,

15:17.700 --> 15:19.300
she's still my Winnie Pooh Ba-ba.

15:19.834 --> 15:21.467
-Your Winnie, who-wa?
-[CHUCKLES]

15:21.834 --> 15:24.400
Fine, I was four years old.
Couldn't pronounce "Grandma."

15:24.467 --> 15:25.533
So sue me.

15:26.000 --> 15:28.734
She makes me the most delicious
grilled cheese sandwiches ever

15:28.867 --> 15:32.400
and she brushes my hair
and we watch game shows together.

15:32.467 --> 15:34.066
And even though I'm old enough

15:34.133 --> 15:35.800
to do all those things on my own,

15:35.867 --> 15:37.834
it means something special
when we do it together.

15:39.166 --> 15:41.233
Now I see why you and David
are so close.

15:43.734 --> 15:44.900
You called him David.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.500
He misses that.

15:48.767 --> 15:49.900
How do you know that?

15:50.834 --> 15:52.100
Did he say something?

15:52.900 --> 15:56.700
[CHUCKLES] Let's just say Gordo
still needs his Winnie Pooh Ba-ba.

15:59.700 --> 16:01.233
I had no idea.

16:02.133 --> 16:03.867
[BREATHES HEAVILY]
[SNEEZES LOUDLY]

16:03.967 --> 16:05.066
Oh!

16:05.934 --> 16:06.967
Hello.

16:07.033 --> 16:09.767
Oh, you must be Lizzie's mother.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.934
Well, I'm very glad to meet you,

16:12.000 --> 16:15.166
but I can see that you're sick
and you need your rest.

16:15.300 --> 16:16.300
I do.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.500
Who are you?

16:18.633 --> 16:20.533
Oh, Mom, this is Gordo's grandma.

16:21.433 --> 16:23.834
[LAUGHS] Don't you worry.

16:23.900 --> 16:25.734
Gorgeous is here
to take care of you.

16:25.800 --> 16:28.533
Now you get back upstairs
and let me get this place

16:28.600 --> 16:30.667
and you back to shape
before you know it.

16:30.734 --> 16:33.233
Um, my husband's not feeling
very well, either.

16:33.433 --> 16:37.600
There are two of you up there?
Well no wonder this place is chaos.

16:37.734 --> 16:41.100
Okay, I'll just... Thank you.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.567
Go, go back to bed.

16:42.734 --> 16:45.400
Okay, Lizzie, help me find a soup pot.

16:45.533 --> 16:47.834
-And what's your brother's name?
-Uh, Matt.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.900
Matt, you clean up this mess.

16:50.967 --> 16:53.200
Put those pillows back
and get that vacuum cleaner out

16:53.433 --> 16:55.166
and show your family some respect.

16:55.333 --> 16:58.133
Sure. And you are...

16:58.567 --> 16:59.867
She's my grandma.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.367
David, have you been there
the whole time?

17:03.667 --> 17:04.934
Long enough.

17:05.266 --> 17:07.800
Well, come over here
and give me some sugar.

17:09.667 --> 17:13.800
[LAUGHS] Oh, honey. Oh...

17:14.033 --> 17:15.066
She may be out on a limb,

17:15.133 --> 17:17.266
but at lease she knows
when to climb back down.

17:17.533 --> 17:20.166
All right, now, find some carrots
and start peeling.

17:20.367 --> 17:22.266
Come on. You, too. Hurry up.

17:25.900 --> 17:28.600
Grandma, I just wanted to tell you
that you weren't totally wrong

17:28.667 --> 17:30.133
about this eating on the floor thing.

17:30.333 --> 17:32.133
-It's fun, isn't it?
-Yeah.

17:32.266 --> 17:34.867
Although it is kind of hard
to eat brisket with chopsticks.

17:35.667 --> 17:38.734
-You're right. [CHUCKLES]
-[CRASHING]

17:38.934 --> 17:41.633
You know, I'm really going to miss you
when Mom and Dad get back.

17:43.033 --> 17:44.233
Well, here's a thought:

17:44.400 --> 17:47.600
there's a new adventure
on my list of things to do.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.000
Mm, what's that?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.600
A trip across America.

17:51.767 --> 17:53.367
I figured I've seen most of the world

17:53.433 --> 17:55.400
but not enough of my own backyard.

17:55.600 --> 17:56.934
Cool.

17:58.100 --> 17:59.700
We could do it together.

18:00.934 --> 18:02.734
We could go during
your summer vacation.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.433
Oh, hot-air ballooning in New Mexico

18:06.567 --> 18:10.400
horseback riding in Montana
and river rafting in Colorado.

18:11.133 --> 18:15.433
-Hot air ballooning, river rafting?
-Mm-hmm.

18:16.800 --> 18:19.000
-Sounds like an adventure.
-[CHUCKLES]

18:19.066 --> 18:21.100
Life affirming, fun even.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.900
[LAUGHS] Here, have some more kugel.

18:26.266 --> 18:27.800
So what you call this stuff again?

18:27.867 --> 18:31.100
Mm, it's kugel.
Some exotic noodle dish.

18:31.300 --> 18:33.266
-Hmm, not bad.
-Mm-hmm.

18:33.333 --> 18:35.100
-Hi, kids.
-Hey.

18:35.233 --> 18:39.233
Guess what? Your dad and I
are feeling so much better.

18:39.367 --> 18:41.633
-You guys feel okay, right?
-I feel great.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.934
Actually, now that you mention it,

18:44.000 --> 18:47.166
I am feeling kind of, you know,
throaty, kind of headachey.

18:47.266 --> 18:48.567
You know, that might have
worked this morning,

18:48.734 --> 18:50.800
but I do remember you have
a test coming up tomorrow,

18:50.867 --> 18:51.867
so it's not going to work now.

18:51.934 --> 18:55.700
Yes, they're feeling much better.

18:55.934 --> 18:59.734
Lizzie, I just want to tell you
how much I appreciate

18:59.800 --> 19:02.100
you taking care of everything
while we were sick.

19:03.100 --> 19:07.533
Although, I vaguely remember
this sweet, older woman

19:07.700 --> 19:12.500
barking at me to get back into bed,
and I thought she brought us the soup.

19:12.567 --> 19:14.934
You know, that does sound
kinda familiar.

19:15.133 --> 19:17.166
Oh, I think that's just
your fevers talking.

19:17.367 --> 19:18.767
Yeah, I guess you're right.

19:18.967 --> 19:21.467
Uh, why don't you guys go upstairs
and I'll bring you some tea

19:21.633 --> 19:23.166

you guys feel better.

please tell Gordo how nice
it was to meet his grandmother.
