<i>Well, the truth is there's not</i>
<i>a single person in this place</i>

00:28.920 --> 00:30.399
<i>worth remembering.</i>

00:32.000 --> 00:33.991
<i>See, the people here are fake.</i>

00:34.960 --> 00:37.428
<i>So they stick to their cliques to hide it.</i>

00:37.840 --> 00:41.674
<i>I mean, the stoners are medicated.</i>
<i>The honor students are afraid.</i>

00:41.760 --> 00:45.992
<i>The jocks... Well, they're jocks, man.</i>

00:46.840 --> 00:48.239
<i>They'll peak at 17.</i>

00:48.320 --> 00:52.791
<i>And their cheerleader girlfriends</i>
<i>will be fat and lonely by 21.</i>

00:54.120 --> 00:57.829
<i>Losers. Everyone here is a loser.</i>

00:58.800 --> 01:03.237
<i>And the truth is, every day</i>
<i>I have to come to this school,</i>

01:03.320 --> 01:05.834
<i>is one less day I have to come back.</i>

01:08.920 --> 01:10.194
Here we go.

01:36.800 --> 01:39.951
Hey, I heard what you said
on the time capsule.

01:40.040 --> 01:41.189
Look, Russ.

01:46.320 --> 01:47.799
Nice locker, loser.

02:24.320 --> 02:25.639
Call 911.

02:27.400 --> 02:30.358
Code Red, Code Red. This is not a drill.

02:30.440 --> 02:34.069
<i>All students to a designated</i>
<i>lockdown area. This is a Code Red.</i>

02:34.160 --> 02:37.755
<i>He puts a shot up and scores.</i>
<i>And the Ravens are down by one.</i>

02:37.880 --> 02:41.714
<i>Repeat. This is a Code Red.</i>
<i>Please go to a designated lockdown area</i>

02:41.840 --> 02:44.400
<i>or exit the school immediately.</i>

02:50.800 --> 02:52.028
Peyton!

02:52.320 --> 02:55.312
Peyton! Peyton!

02:57.920 --> 02:59.512
Hey, Jake. Let's go! Come on, man!

02:59.600 --> 03:00.919
What the hell?

03:03.200 --> 03:05.236
Somebody has a gun inside
and they're shooting.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.753
- Haley!
- My God!

03:06.840 --> 03:09.593
- Everybody back on the bus!
- I lost Peyton. I don't know where she is.

03:09.680 --> 03:10.954
I mean, she was right there
and then a shot went off

03:11.040 --> 03:12.109
and now she's gone.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.269
Brooke, wait! Peyton was shot?

03:13.360 --> 03:14.759
No, I don't know.
She was right behind me.

03:14.840 --> 03:17.229
- We were by the library.
- Haley's in the tutor center.

03:17.320 --> 03:21.199
All students on the bus! Code Red! Now!
Let's move! Come on!

03:21.840 --> 03:24.149
Nathan, get your ass on that bus.

03:25.840 --> 03:26.909
- I got him, Coach.
- Luke!

03:27.000 --> 03:28.592
Brooke, I'll be right back.

03:28.680 --> 03:29.749
Nathan!

03:30.120 --> 03:32.475
Boys! Boys!

03:34.200 --> 03:35.519
Get off me, man.

03:36.440 --> 03:37.668
Haley's inside.

03:39.360 --> 03:40.588
Nathan!

03:42.560 --> 03:44.915
Lucas! Lucas!

03:45.640 --> 03:48.757
Get on the bus. Jerry, drive. Go! Go!

04:03.680 --> 04:07.355
Okay, everybody just stay down
and stay calm. We're safe here.

04:31.520 --> 04:33.192
- You got a plan?
- Yeah.

04:33.280 --> 04:36.272
I'm going to the tutor center
and I'm gonna get Haley.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.391
- What are you doing?
- The plan sucks.

04:40.480 --> 04:41.469
- You got a better one?
- Yeah.

04:41.560 --> 04:43.152
We turn around
and let the police handle this.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.754
The police are gonna wait and game-plan.
They always do that.

04:45.840 --> 04:46.909
And what?

04:47.280 --> 04:49.794
You gonna stop a bullet
with a baseball bat?

04:49.880 --> 04:52.952
Hey, Nathan, Nathan.
Someone has a gun in here.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.759
Lucas, I know that.
Okay, I know this is stupid.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.479
But what if something happens
to Haley, huh?

04:57.560 --> 04:59.596
What if we walk away
and something happens to Haley?

04:59.680 --> 05:01.352
You gonna live with that?

05:01.800 --> 05:03.552
Most heroes are dead, Nate.

05:05.640 --> 05:07.517
It's Haley, Lucas.

05:10.160 --> 05:11.434
We need to get out of here.

05:11.520 --> 05:14.910
No, we need to stay put.
It's procedure, lockdown.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.314
We have to wait until it's safe.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.356
And I'm saying lockdown is crap.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.670
If whoever's out there is a student,
they know where we're at.

05:20.760 --> 05:24.036
What about the windows?
We could break the windows and get out.

05:24.120 --> 05:27.396
No, it just goes to a courtyard.
It's enclosed. It's just for light.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.710
Yeah. Besides, we get to breaking
all the windows,

05:29.800 --> 05:31.438
all we do is draw attention to ourselves.

05:31.520 --> 05:33.192
And you don't think
a locked door is gonna tell

05:33.280 --> 05:35.111
whatever psycho is out there
that we're in here?

05:35.200 --> 05:37.111
Why would you call him psycho?

05:40.640 --> 05:43.791
Something to do with them
trying to kill us all, fat ass.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.913
Look, there's blood.

05:52.480 --> 05:54.152
Nate, it could be Peyton.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.999
- You don't know that.
- Yeah, well, it's someone.

05:57.280 --> 05:59.157
The library doors don't lock. It's not safe.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.595
Lucas. I have to find Haley.

06:02.520 --> 06:03.509
I know.

06:04.640 --> 06:05.709
Okay.

06:08.080 --> 06:09.115
Nathan.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.958
Yeah. You, too, man.

07:16.720 --> 07:19.553
- Peyton. Hey! Hey, it's okay.
- Oh, my leg.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.111
I got cut by some glass.

07:22.680 --> 07:24.989
Lucas, I lost Brooke. I'm sorry.

07:25.080 --> 07:28.072
She's fine. She's fine.
But, okay, you're not.

07:28.760 --> 07:30.113
We gotta get you somewhere safe.
Come on.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.589
No, I can't. I can't walk. I tried.

07:33.720 --> 07:34.709
Okay.

07:37.080 --> 07:39.674
- Okay.
- No, don't leave me, please.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.749
- No, look, look, hey.
- Please?

07:40.840 --> 07:43.195
I'm gonna go block the entrance, all right.

07:43.280 --> 07:45.510
We'll just hide, all right?

07:45.600 --> 07:47.318
We'll wait this out, okay?

07:47.720 --> 07:49.233
Listen to me, okay?

07:50.440 --> 07:52.271
I'm not leaving you, Peyton.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.599
I won't.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.159
I won't, okay?

08:11.000 --> 08:12.399
Dude, what's happening?

08:12.480 --> 08:14.436
Mouth, what are you doing here?

08:14.600 --> 08:17.478
I was in the A/V room and I come out
and it's like <i>Dawn of the Dead.</i>

08:18.400 --> 08:21.472
Mouth, don't say "dead."
Someone's got a gun in the school.

08:21.360 --> 08:22.634
- What?
- Yeah.

08:24.520 --> 08:27.159
- We gotta get out of here.
- Yeah, you gotta get out of here.

08:26.280 --> 08:27.759
I gotta go get Haley.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.433
I'll stay with you.

08:34.600 --> 08:35.635
Let's go.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.753
"No signal. All circuits busy."

08:42.960 --> 08:44.757
- It's Nathan.
- No way.

08:56.240 --> 08:58.276
- We don't know it's him.
- No, it's his driver's license.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.519
So how do you know
that somebody didn't kill him

09:00.240 --> 09:01.468
and take his ID?

09:01.720 --> 09:04.314
Okay, you're the one that said
this is a lockdown. Every man for himself.

09:03.040 --> 09:05.679
- She can't leave him out there.
- Don't open it.

09:05.720 --> 09:07.836
- Do not open that door.
- Shut up. Shut up.

09:09.640 --> 09:10.834
Let me just...

09:11.840 --> 09:13.956
- Always.
- And forever.

09:15.320 --> 09:16.309
- It's him.
- No way.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.598
Get away from the door.

09:20.040 --> 09:22.918
Look, if she say it's him, it's him.
Open the door.

09:22.720 --> 09:25.757
- Thank God. Come here. You okay?
- Yeah. What's going on out there?

09:27.720 --> 09:29.711
I don't know.
We're getting out of here, okay? All of us.

09:30.840 --> 09:32.239
- Let's go.
- Don't.

09:32.920 --> 09:34.672
Nobody's going anywhere.

09:39.040 --> 09:40.678
Get away from the door.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.953
- Jimmy?
- Do it, Mouth!

09:54.480 --> 09:55.754
All right, all right, just chill out.

09:55.920 --> 09:57.911
Everyone get away from the door.

09:57.280 --> 09:59.589
- Oh, Jimmy, what did you do?
- Move back, Skills.

09:59.360 --> 10:02.079
Or what, you gonna shoot me?
We used to be friends, dog.

10:01.760 --> 10:04.035
- Yeah, used to be.
- So it's like that?

10:04.560 --> 10:06.790
- Yeah, all right.
- Jim, you can't do this.

10:07.160 --> 10:08.229
It's a little late for that, Mouth.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.515
I can't be here.

10:10.640 --> 10:12.870
Look, man, just let us go.
I'm sorry I called you "fat ass."

10:11.760 --> 10:13.830
It's a little late for that, too.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.559
How about you, hero?

10:17.360 --> 10:18.509
You scared?

10:19.640 --> 10:21.471
Yeah. I'm scared.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.955
Good. Welcome to my world.

10:23.920 --> 10:24.989
All right.

10:28.160 --> 10:29.832
All right, this is what we're gonna do.

10:33.240 --> 10:36.198
You're gonna tape a line
down the center of the room.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.194
Go on!

10:38.560 --> 10:40.152
Why are you doing this?

10:39.960 --> 10:41.632
You're Abby Brown, right?

10:42.000 --> 10:44.719
- What's my name?
- Jim.

10:44.120 --> 10:45.599
My full name.

10:46.960 --> 10:48.871
Come on, who am I?

10:48.680 --> 10:50.989
- I don't know.
- He's the guy from the time capsule.

10:50.800 --> 10:54.190
Jimmy Edwards. You're Jimmy Edwards.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.192
And you're a good guy.
And you are better than this.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.431
Just shut up, all of you.
Shut up and sit down.

11:00.280 --> 11:02.714
Jimmy, seven hostages
in the tutor center?

11:03.600 --> 11:04.635
That's not you.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.155
What are you doing?
What's in your pocket?

11:07.280 --> 11:08.269
- Nothing.
- What's in your pocket?

11:08.400 --> 11:09.628
Hey, okay, stop pointing
the gun at her, all right?

11:09.480 --> 11:12.631
- It's just my phone, okay?
- Give it to me. Throw it here.

11:10.800 --> 11:13.837
Haley, I used to like you.

11:17.760 --> 11:20.752
Hi, 911? Yeah, here's the thing.

11:21.680 --> 11:24.638
If anyone comes even
remotely close to this school,

11:24.800 --> 11:26.552
we start shooting students.

11:27.840 --> 11:29.034
You hear me?

11:30.040 --> 11:32.759
You come in here, your kids die.

11:31.400 --> 11:34.039
All right, I want everyone's cell phones.
Let's go!

11:36.280 --> 11:38.919
And you, Missy Pepper Spray.
Roll it over here.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.036
The baseball bat, too. Come on.

11:41.800 --> 11:44.758
- Where's your phone, Scott?
- I don't have it with me.

11:46.560 --> 11:48.437
You can check me if you want.

11:50.520 --> 11:52.078
Just tape the line.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.194
You're kidding me, right?

12:01.560 --> 12:04.393
How the hell can a kid just waltz
into a high school with a handgun?

12:02.840 --> 12:04.910
Where the hell is the security,
the metal detectors?

12:05.760 --> 12:09.355
Security guards carry nightsticks, Dan.
Handguns scare people.

12:07.920 --> 12:09.956
They need probable cause
to shake a kid down,

12:11.600 --> 12:13.556
because God forbid we violate their rights.

12:13.720 --> 12:15.790
And as far as metal detectors go,
the school board,

12:15.760 --> 12:17.751
which I believe you're on,
voted against them.

12:17.920 --> 12:19.353
Voted against them? Why?

12:20.000 --> 12:21.831
Because they make the school look unsafe.

12:21.520 --> 12:24.751
911's got a possible identification
on one of the shooters.

12:23.440 --> 12:24.668
Jimmy Edwards?

12:27.320 --> 12:30.596
- Phillip! Phillip Rich!
- My son Jeff, Jeff Brun.

12:28.760 --> 12:31.991
- Look, I just want to go home, okay?
- Not without a parent.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.031
But my parents don't live here.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.829
Then I guess you'll be here for a while.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.919
Come on, Lucas.

12:42.040 --> 12:43.075
Jimmy Edwards.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.750
- Mary Edwards?
- Yes.

12:44.720 --> 12:45.869
Could you come with me, please?

12:47.040 --> 12:50.919
- Is my son okay?
- Please just come with me, ma'am.

12:48.280 --> 12:49.474
God.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.468
You're bleeding pretty good.

13:02.720 --> 13:05.234
We're gonna have to put
some pressure on it.

13:04.040 --> 13:06.554
Luke. It was your friend.

13:07.400 --> 13:09.436
The one from the time capsule.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.354
He had the gun.

13:14.400 --> 13:16.595
But he didn't look evil or angry.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.352
He just looked scared.

13:21.280 --> 13:23.430
All right, nobody crosses that line.

13:30.680 --> 13:32.113
If anybody does...

13:32.920 --> 13:33.909
Just don't.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.793
Or what, Jim? Would you really do that?

13:36.200 --> 13:38.839
- Would you shoot us?
- Don't talk to me, Haley.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.638
'Cause I don't think that you would.

13:41.720 --> 13:44.109
Right. When's the last time we hung out?

13:43.440 --> 13:46.910
You're as bad as my best friend, Mouth,
who totally blew me off.

13:46.360 --> 13:47.873
You didn't want to do anything.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.038
Tell yourself that,
but you changed and you know it.

13:51.680 --> 13:53.750
You became just like the rest of them.

13:54.920 --> 13:56.273
Don't do that.

13:57.080 --> 13:59.310
Don't make him feel guilty
for living his life.

13:59.040 --> 14:01.998
This is not his fault. This is your fault.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.793
No. It's your fault.

14:04.400 --> 14:06.391
You think this is what I wanted?

14:06.560 --> 14:09.472
You think I got up today and wanted this?

14:09.160 --> 14:10.832
I just wanted it to stop.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.030
This is kind of screwed up, huh, Skills?

14:16.880 --> 14:18.632
It's more than kind of, dog.

14:19.120 --> 14:20.235
For real.

14:20.960 --> 14:22.871
We could charge you, you know?

14:22.160 --> 14:25.197
We all charge you at once,
no way you shoot us all.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.671
Yeah, you're probably right,

14:28.320 --> 14:29.992
but who's gonna be first?

14:31.560 --> 14:35.439
Besides, even if you get past me
the others will get you.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.955
- Are there others, Jim?
- No, no, no.

14:38.600 --> 14:40.875
I was out there. It's just you.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.274
You think so?

14:43.680 --> 14:45.910
You really think I'm the only one?

14:45.480 --> 14:47.072
Then ask yourself this.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.911
You ever treat someone like crap
in this school?

14:52.880 --> 14:54.313
Or left anyone out?

14:54.960 --> 14:56.313
You ever broken up with someone

14:57.000 --> 14:59.639
in the time it takes
to pass a note and disappear?

14:58.440 --> 15:00.510
Or talked trash behind their back?

15:01.160 --> 15:03.230
Or maybe you just ignored it all.

15:03.440 --> 15:07.035
You know, while you worry
about the big game or the prom

15:05.640 --> 15:07.790
or the bake sale for the pep club.

15:09.960 --> 15:11.234
You ask yourselves that,

15:12.640 --> 15:15.279
and then you tell me
is anyone else out there?

15:14.000 --> 15:16.833
- Whose phone is that?
- It's mine.

15:19.360 --> 15:22.670
- It's the ring tone for my mom.
- God, I hate that song.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.469
Yeah, open your eyes. Your son's a dick.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.073
Open your eyes!

15:31.200 --> 15:32.474
Open your eyes!

15:33.760 --> 15:35.239
Open your eyes!

15:36.040 --> 15:37.712
Think I'm playing around?

15:38.880 --> 15:39.995
Just chill out.

15:41.120 --> 15:42.997
- Jimmy, please.
- You're not gonna do it.

15:42.320 --> 15:45.357
- Shut up. Don't push me.
- Skills, help me out here.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.316
- Yo, Marcus, man.
- You better back him up.

15:47.400 --> 15:48.594
- Listen to him.
- He's not gonna do it!

15:49.520 --> 15:50.794
- Marcus!
- What?

15:50.800 --> 15:52.199
That help you out?

15:54.520 --> 15:57.557
Behind the line! Move, Skills!

15:56.640 --> 15:58.198
Get behind the line!

16:00.480 --> 16:02.755
Look, Reeves, with all due respect,

16:07.200 --> 16:08.474
you know where this Edwards kid is at.

16:09.560 --> 16:12.358
You need to get control of the situation
and get somebody into that school.

16:10.920 --> 16:12.558
We know where one kid's at.

16:13.800 --> 16:15.552
Now, can you guarantee me
that's the only kid

16:15.520 --> 16:18.239
who walked into that school
with a gun this morning?

16:17.360 --> 16:19.590
Look, Mayor, this is a static situation.

16:20.160 --> 16:22.549
If and when it becomes active,
we will intervene.

16:22.480 --> 16:25.438
But until then,
there's a mandated procedure.

16:24.960 --> 16:27.997
We secure the area,
we wait for the crisis negotiator

16:28.000 --> 16:31.390
and we pray to God that Tree Hill High
doesn't become just another catch phrase

16:31.120 --> 16:34.032
that people only whisper about
for the rest of time.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.477
Is it true? Is it Jimmy Edwards?

16:40.800 --> 16:41.915
One of them.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.830
I know him. He's not a bad kid.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.314
He is now.

16:48.360 --> 16:49.395
Hey.

16:56.080 --> 16:58.469
I don't even know what Lucas is wearing.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.513
The policeman asked

17:01.000 --> 17:03.719
and I couldn't even tell
what Lucas was wearing.

17:02.440 --> 17:05.272
I didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.

17:05.359 --> 17:07.031
You're not gonna have to.

17:08.280 --> 17:09.917
You're not gonna have to.

17:10.839 --> 17:14.833
<i>The truth is,</i>
<i>every day I have to come to this school,</i>

17:16.640 --> 17:18.949
<i>is one less day I have to come back.</i>

17:21.440 --> 17:23.954
That's excellent.
I want to air this with a live feed.

17:23.839 --> 17:27.195
I'll get student reactions, their emotions.
There's gold here.

17:26.440 --> 17:28.715
A little insensitive, don't you think?

17:32.040 --> 17:35.874
- And you might be?
- Brooke Davis, Student Council President.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.630
I'm here with Student Council President,
Brooke Davis.

17:43.520 --> 17:45.192
Brooke, can you put into words

17:45.680 --> 17:48.194
how you might be feeling
about this tragedy?

17:47.440 --> 17:49.510
You should be ashamed of yourself.

17:51.080 --> 17:52.752
Here comes the SWAT team.

18:11.360 --> 18:13.794
If you see any red dots on your forehead,

18:13.360 --> 18:14.873
you might wanna duck.

18:15.920 --> 18:19.196
No, it's just the reporters.
We all part of this circus now.

18:17.840 --> 18:21.037
Hey, can I ask you a question?
What do you want to happen?

18:21.600 --> 18:23.272
What do I want to happen?

18:25.640 --> 18:29.189
Yeah, I want to crap a million dollars
and a plane ticket to Bolivia.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.357
Maybe you could just give up.

18:32.200 --> 18:34.873
Oh, yeah, that's it. I'll just call a do-over.

18:34.080 --> 18:36.310
Why not? You didn't hurt anybody.

18:36.840 --> 18:37.875
Did you?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.831
Did you shoot anyone, Jimmy?

18:42.200 --> 18:43.474
I don't know.

18:46.120 --> 18:47.917
You don't have a record, Jim.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.956
You're a good student and you're a minor.

18:49.720 --> 18:52.837
Yeah, and maybe this isn't
as bad as you think.

18:51.920 --> 18:55.071
You're kidding, right?
The guy shot up a school.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.430
- Would you shut up, man?
- You shut up.

19:01.800 --> 19:03.279
I'm not lying for him.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.636
He pointed a gun at my head
and threatened to kill me.

19:06.160 --> 19:07.798
I hope they fry his ass.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.032
Hey, what's wrong with you?

19:10.320 --> 19:11.753
He's just a kid.

19:12.840 --> 19:16.150
We're all just kids
and we just have this life.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.474
And the things you say and do,
we feel that.

19:19.360 --> 19:21.874
How can you have so much hate
in your heart?

19:23.040 --> 19:26.589
How can you act like it doesn't matter?
It does matter.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.272
What happened to us, huh?

19:31.880 --> 19:35.429
We're just kids. We can't be like this.

19:33.960 --> 19:35.871
It's not possible.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.358
700 days.

19:42.120 --> 19:43.235
High school.

19:45.120 --> 19:49.318
Out of 20,000 or 30,000,
can't you see past that?

19:47.240 --> 19:49.151
It's only 700 days.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.595
Yeah? And how many of these days
do I get back?

19:55.800 --> 19:58.030
Do I get back the days I got spit on?

20:01.680 --> 20:05.150
Or the day I learned to look at the floor
when I walk the halls?

20:04.680 --> 20:06.955
Or how about the day
my dad came to pick me up

20:08.360 --> 20:10.635
and saw me getting my ass kicked
on the quad,

20:10.720 --> 20:12.790
and realized his son was a loser?

20:13.080 --> 20:16.675
You ever see the look in your father's eyes
when he realizes that?

20:17.560 --> 20:19.232
Do I get that day back?

20:22.560 --> 20:25.757
'Cause I saw that same look
the day he left me and my mom.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.399
That sucks, man.

20:31.800 --> 20:34.678
- I'm sorry.
- It's great you're sorry.

20:34.440 --> 20:36.078
Well, you can forget it.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.477
This ain't <i>Breakfast Club.</i>

20:41.400 --> 20:44.039
You know, we're not all gonna
fire up a joint and be pals.

20:43.360 --> 20:44.588
I mean, let's face it,

20:46.080 --> 20:49.277
this is the most any of us
have talked in four years.

20:47.400 --> 20:49.516
And we all know, if I don't have this gun,

20:51.000 --> 20:52.592
Look, people suck, okay?

20:53.200 --> 20:55.156
But it's just high school, man.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.630
Yeah. There's always college, right?

20:58.640 --> 21:01.393
MIT. Remember, Jim?

21:01.840 --> 21:03.273
They rejected me.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.959
And you know why?

21:09.960 --> 21:11.757
Not enough activities.

21:12.040 --> 21:14.793
Yeah, I guess
Tree Hill Fight Club doesn't count.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.753
You know, one school
is not the end of the world.

21:17.640 --> 21:19.073
Yeah, it is for me.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.752
That's the end of my world.

21:23.880 --> 21:25.074
So what?

21:25.560 --> 21:28.074
All this because you didn't
get into college?

21:27.680 --> 21:30.114
- All this because you're not popular?
- No.

21:29.280 --> 21:31.350
All this because I'm tired of it.

21:32.840 --> 21:35.991
I'm tired, Luke. Are you tired?

21:37.920 --> 21:40.639
Yeah. But you got to stay awake, all right?

21:51.240 --> 21:52.468
Talk to me.

21:55.760 --> 21:57.432
Tell me about a good day.

21:59.240 --> 22:03.153
We had a snow day, sixth grade.
Do you remember?

22:01.600 --> 22:06.196
It was like this whole other world
just came in overnight

22:06.560 --> 22:08.278
and took ours away.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.513
And Brooke, she came over

22:17.440 --> 22:20.591
and we made a snow fort with a tunnel.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.235
And we stayed inside there all day.

22:24.680 --> 22:27.069
And it seemed so safe.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.435
Like everything was okay.

22:35.680 --> 22:38.956
Like everything our world
was about to become,

22:38.200 --> 22:40.236
maybe we could just stop it

22:42.280 --> 22:44.999
and stay little kids for one more day.

22:46.600 --> 22:48.397
But then it got cold.

22:50.520 --> 22:52.033
Kind of like now.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.112
They're gonna come now.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.391
- Who?
- All of them.

23:04.680 --> 23:08.992
The reporters and the psychologists.

23:07.800 --> 23:12.555
Then the analysts
and the so-called experts.

23:11.640 --> 23:14.279
And they're gonna try
to make sense of this.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.389
But they're not gonna be able to.

23:21.800 --> 23:24.234
And even if we do make it out of here,

23:25.640 --> 23:27.790
we're always gonna carry it with us.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.676
It's never gonna be the same.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.678
It's not glass, is it?

23:36.840 --> 23:37.989
In my leg?

23:45.600 --> 23:46.635
No.

23:48.560 --> 23:49.754
It's a bullet.

23:52.400 --> 23:54.960
Now, I may have to get you
out of here, okay?

23:55.080 --> 23:56.991
But nothing will happen to you.

23:58.240 --> 23:59.309
I promise.

24:02.440 --> 24:04.510
You're always saving me.

24:05.160 --> 24:06.752
Somebody's got to.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.678
If I say,

24:11.880 --> 24:13.632
"I love you" right now,

24:17.400 --> 24:19.231
will you hold it against me?

24:20.520 --> 24:22.670
Because I've lost a lot of blood.

24:22.360 --> 24:23.509
Come here.

24:24.920 --> 24:27.309
Just in case you can't keep your promise.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.038
That warm your heart?

24:42.000 --> 24:44.389
You think America would tune in
for that every night?

24:57.120 --> 24:59.554
Have you seen the ratings for <i>7th Heaven?</i>

25:00.960 --> 25:03.758
We're a country
obsessed with tragedy, Brooke.

25:03.440 --> 25:06.113
So if examining tragedy makes me
part of the problem,

25:07.120 --> 25:08.553
then so be it.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.877
But let me ask you something.

25:13.760 --> 25:17.673
How much time have you spent with
Jimmy Edwards over the last four years?

25:15.840 --> 25:18.752
So maybe I'm not the only one
who should be ashamed.

25:17.840 --> 25:18.955
Brooke?

25:24.880 --> 25:28.077
Hi, I'm Glenda's mom.
I was wondering if you had seen her.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.355
I'm sorry. I don't know anyone...

25:38.880 --> 25:40.916
Glenda Farrell. She's in your class.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.198
She said you were friends.

25:45.760 --> 25:48.399
Glenda. I thought you said Brenda.

25:47.880 --> 25:49.757
I'm sorry. Sure.

25:52.240 --> 25:53.593
I'll find her.

25:54.960 --> 25:56.678
I need to get out of here.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.790
Yeah, me too. Can we get a hall pass?

26:27.200 --> 26:30.556
Has it only been an hour?
It seems like it's been longer than that.

26:29.800 --> 26:33.156
- I have Current Events this period.
- I think this counts.

26:32.720 --> 26:33.835
Edwards?

26:36.160 --> 26:38.469
Where are you supposed to be right now?

26:41.480 --> 26:44.438
I'm supposed to be in AP English,
but I stopped going.

26:43.000 --> 26:44.115
Why?

26:45.720 --> 26:48.678
Well, because I missed a couple of weeks
about three months ago

26:48.760 --> 26:50.398
and I couldn't catch up.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.871
You see, one day I spent
a whole day in this school

26:53.000 --> 26:56.390
without a single person
looking at me or talking to me.

26:56.800 --> 27:00.713
And I realized that was the best day
I'd had in a long time.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.075
The day that nobody noticed me at all.

27:02.840 --> 27:04.751
The day I stopped being there.

27:07.720 --> 27:09.278
That was the best day.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.433
Well, that was kind of depressing,

27:13.840 --> 27:16.912
so I went home
and took an anti-depressant.

27:17.520 --> 27:19.397
And then, I took another one.

27:19.120 --> 27:21.315
And then, for fun, I took 12 more.

27:23.320 --> 27:26.039
My mom and the doctors
called it an accident.

27:26.200 --> 27:29.112
And then two weeks later,
when I got back to school,

27:30.760 --> 27:32.432
nobody noticed.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.151
It was like I never left.

27:39.080 --> 27:42.914
I guess that's the upside
to not being there in the first place, right?

27:42.120 --> 27:44.236
Nobody misses you when you're gone.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.990
It's not supposed to be this way.

27:51.160 --> 27:53.594
The artists and the scientists and poets,

27:56.040 --> 27:57.951
none of them fit in at 17.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.836
You're supposed to get past it.

28:03.400 --> 28:06.312
Adults, they see kids killing kids,

28:07.960 --> 28:12.397
and they know it's a tragedy
because they used to be those kids.

28:10.960 --> 28:13.713
The bullies and the beaten and the loners.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.871
You're supposed to get past it.

28:18.880 --> 28:21.792
You're supposed to live long enough
to take it back.

28:26.080 --> 28:27.832
Just take it all back.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.109
Excuse me.

28:34.400 --> 28:36.630
- Yeah.
- Okay.

28:42.280 --> 28:43.554
Your mom's here.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.270
Oh, I know. I just...

28:47.600 --> 28:50.194
I thought I'd sit here a little while longer.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.395
Why?

28:52.560 --> 28:55.028
Sometimes I think
she takes me for granted.

28:55.840 --> 28:58.274
Like it wouldn't matter if I wasn't here.

29:01.200 --> 29:03.839
I guess I just wanted her
to be afraid of losing me.

29:03.640 --> 29:06.791
You know, feel it a little.

29:08.000 --> 29:10.639
I don't know.
That's pretty horrible, isn't it?

29:11.880 --> 29:13.108
Not really.

29:14.600 --> 29:16.431
Well, I guess I better go.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.475
Hey, Glenda.

29:24.360 --> 29:26.396
I'm really sorry I don't know you.

29:29.560 --> 29:32.393
That's okay. I know you.

29:34.280 --> 29:36.191
Hey, I'm really sorry to call.

29:38.720 --> 29:39.869
Okay.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.069
That was Brooke.

29:57.720 --> 29:59.517
They won't release her without an adult,
but I...

30:01.480 --> 30:03.311
It's okay. I'll wait here.

30:03.720 --> 30:06.359
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

30:04.880 --> 30:07.519
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to our boy.

30:06.760 --> 30:07.954
Come here.

30:10.120 --> 30:12.190
You shouldn't have come back for me.

30:13.720 --> 30:16.518
I love you for doing it,
but I wish you were safe.

30:18.040 --> 30:20.190
I don't want to be safe without you.

30:35.920 --> 30:37.797
I heard what you said, Scott.

30:38.080 --> 30:40.275
In the time capsule, about Haley.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.915
Guys like you can get away with it.

30:44.520 --> 30:45.919
Guys like me, huh?

30:47.000 --> 30:49.434
You can pass judgment
about "guys like me" all you want,

30:50.360 --> 30:52.555
but somebody stereotypes you
and there's gunplay?

30:53.720 --> 30:54.755
Whatever.

30:56.040 --> 30:58.873
Your worst day in this place
would be my best day.

30:58.560 --> 30:59.788
Okay, okay. Maybe so.

31:00.840 --> 31:03.070
All right, maybe it is easier
for me and my friends.

31:02.400 --> 31:05.073
But you know what? That doesn't make
what you're doing right, does it?

31:05.320 --> 31:07.470
This is wrong, man. All of this.

31:06.640 --> 31:08.358
And I think you know that.

31:08.960 --> 31:11.428
Abby, you okay?

31:11.720 --> 31:12.914
I'm fine.

31:13.960 --> 31:15.234
No, you're not.

31:16.360 --> 31:19.113
- You're diabetic? Where's your insulin?
- What's wrong with her?

31:19.440 --> 31:21.271
She's diabetic. Where is it?

31:27.160 --> 31:29.958
In my locker, across the quad. I'm sorry.

31:32.440 --> 31:35.352
Oh no, forget it. It's impossible.

31:35.280 --> 31:36.759
You could let her go.

31:37.240 --> 31:40.357
- Yeah, you got us, dog.
- Jimmy, she's really sick.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.395
- Let her go, Jim.
- Yeah, let her go.

31:43.120 --> 31:44.519
Unbelievable.

31:44.760 --> 31:47.911
- All right, just you. Come on.
- Come on, Abby.

31:48.120 --> 31:50.793
Hey, I'm sick, too. Seriously, I feel terrible.

31:51.040 --> 31:53.429
Stay behind the line! Come on.

31:54.560 --> 31:56.471
Go on, before I change my mind!

32:00.080 --> 32:02.469
- I'm scared.
- Of what?

32:03.000 --> 32:04.194
The others.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.958
Are there others, Jim?

32:17.720 --> 32:19.995
Does this feel well-planned to you?

32:21.240 --> 32:22.753
Go.

32:23.520 --> 32:26.239
Hey! What are you doing?
You said you didn't have a phone!

32:27.280 --> 32:28.633
Who did you call?

32:34.120 --> 32:36.076
They'd better not come in here.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.592
I just got a text message from Nathan.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.870
Is he in there? Is Lucas with him?

33:28.120 --> 33:31.396
He says this kid is the only one.
They're in the tutor center.

33:31.200 --> 33:33.031
And it's Jimmy Edwards, huh?

33:32.880 --> 33:35.599
Look, Danny, I know
we've had our differences lately,

33:35.640 --> 33:38.074
but you got to let me try to talk to him.

33:39.000 --> 33:42.151
I know this kid.
If they go in there, he's gonna get spooked

33:41.400 --> 33:43.550
and this thing's gonna turn out bad.

33:44.200 --> 33:46.714
- Please, just let me try.
- No way. It's too dangerous.

33:46.880 --> 33:47.915
Dan.

33:50.120 --> 33:51.235
Please.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.198
You can get me in there.

33:55.160 --> 33:56.559
Nobody has to know.

33:57.040 --> 33:58.758
I should have known
it was all about the gun.

33:58.880 --> 34:01.792
So what, do I have to pull the trigger
again for you to take me seriously?

34:00.960 --> 34:02.552
- No.
- Edwards, come on, man.

34:05.240 --> 34:06.275
I promise you.

34:07.040 --> 34:09.873
Whoever steps into that hallway
is gonna die.

34:10.040 --> 34:11.268
I got you.

34:11.719 --> 34:13.472
I guess that's my cue.

34:12.840 --> 34:13.955
Don't.

34:18.040 --> 34:20.679
Just stop. Change it.

34:28.440 --> 34:29.429
Don't do this.

34:32.600 --> 34:36.070
Please, Jim? Just turn yourself in.
I can go with you.

34:35.000 --> 34:36.672
This can't be happening.

34:39.560 --> 34:42.518
Yo, Edwards, man,
it don't have to be like this, dog.

34:40.639 --> 34:42.471
Yeah, I think it does.

34:44.920 --> 34:46.148
Jimmy.

34:46.679 --> 34:49.433
You know, they're gonna remember me
as a monster.

34:50.679 --> 34:53.114
I wonder how they'll remember all of you.

34:57.880 --> 35:00.110
Hey, where do you think you're going?

35:01.280 --> 35:04.511
- She's bleeding.
- The school's on lockdown!

35:06.320 --> 35:07.469
I know, Jim.

35:39.760 --> 35:42.672
But if I don't get her out of here,
she's gonna die.

35:44.320 --> 35:46.038
I didn't mean to hurt her.

35:48.280 --> 35:51.158
- We know that, Jimmy.
- What the hell is this?

35:50.520 --> 35:53.273
The school's on lockdown!

35:54.320 --> 35:57.517
Please, Jimmy, just...
Please, just let them go

35:57.880 --> 36:00.633
and you and I can talk about this.

36:00.960 --> 36:04.111
- She's hurt, Jimmy.
- I didn't mean it.

36:04.000 --> 36:05.069
I know.

36:07.280 --> 36:08.395
Go on, Luke.

36:11.160 --> 36:12.752
- Keith.
- Luke.

36:17.320 --> 36:18.833
I love you. Now go.

36:24.120 --> 36:26.680
Why don't you just hand me
that gun, Jimmy,

36:32.720 --> 36:34.153
and we can just follow them out of here.

36:36.080 --> 36:37.229
I can't.

36:48.240 --> 36:50.629
Well, I'm not gonna leave you here, son.

36:50.880 --> 36:53.474
I'm not gonna do that, and I'll tell you why.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.038
Because I've been there.

36:54.840 --> 36:58.150
I've bought the gun
and I planned on using it, okay?

36:59.120 --> 37:00.439
I've been there.

37:02.680 --> 37:04.750
And I want to tell you something.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.034
It gets better.

37:08.240 --> 37:11.789
- Not this. It can't.
- It does, Jimmy.

37:10.120 --> 37:13.715
That pain in your stomach,
that pain in your heart, it goes away.

37:13.640 --> 37:16.234
That voice in your head
that's saying there's no way out,

37:15.120 --> 37:16.633
it's wrong, Jimmy.

37:19.000 --> 37:22.151
Would you please, please just believe me?

37:22.960 --> 37:26.509
- It gets better.
- It won't. Not after this.

37:25.640 --> 37:29.349
I can't take this back! I can't erase this!

37:28.000 --> 37:29.433
She's gonna die.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.832
You don't know that.

37:34.880 --> 37:37.838
<i>I just... I wanted...</i>

37:40.880 --> 37:42.916
I wanted them to leave me alone.

37:43.480 --> 37:44.549
I just...

37:50.840 --> 37:52.592
I wanted them to like me.

37:54.520 --> 37:57.080
<i>I understand, son. It's what we all want.</i>

37:57.640 --> 37:59.392
<i>That's all any of us wants.</i>

37:59.480 --> 38:00.629
I'm not here.

38:03.040 --> 38:05.076
- I'm not here.
- Jimmy, please.

38:06.520 --> 38:09.671
It's gonna be okay, son. It's gonna be okay.

38:11.160 --> 38:12.832
But it hurts.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.238
It hurts. It always hurts!

38:20.640 --> 38:21.629
I know.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.594
Please.

38:26.360 --> 38:27.509
Please.

38:29.320 --> 38:30.833
I'm sorry.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.194
No!

38:36.800 --> 38:38.711
<i>Does this darkness have a name?</i>

38:40.240 --> 38:42.470
<i>This cruelty, this hatred.</i>

38:42.240 --> 38:43.753
<i>How did it find us?</i>

38:57.040 --> 38:59.270
<i>That we now send our children</i>
<i>into the world</i>

39:00.240 --> 39:02.595
<i>like we send young men to war,</i>

39:10.960 --> 39:12.916
<i>hoping for their safe return,</i>

39:14.120 --> 39:17.237
<i>but knowing that some</i>
<i>will be lost along the way.</i>

39:16.440 --> 39:18.396
<i>When did we lose our way?</i>

39:21.440 --> 39:25.194
<i>Consumed by the shadows,</i>
<i>swallowed whole by the darkness.</i>

39:24.640 --> 39:26.073
He's gone, Danny.

39:38.320 --> 39:39.435
He's gone.

39:42.320 --> 39:44.515
<i>Does this darkness have a name?</i>

39:48.240 --> 39:50.071
<i>Is it your name?</i>

39:51.200 --> 39:52.269
