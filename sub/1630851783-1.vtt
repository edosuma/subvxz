WEBVTT

00:11.310 --> 00:13.310
..in your name.

00:13.310 --> 00:15.990
Keep him safe with you always.

00:41.310 --> 00:43.310
Er...
Come here.

00:48.310 --> 00:51.310
Don't you dare take this off.

00:52.510 --> 00:53.830
OK?

00:55.310 --> 00:57.310
Yeah.

01:07.310 --> 01:09.310
Gaby!

01:10.310 --> 01:12.310
You know I'm dairy free.

01:12.310 --> 01:14.310
So, it's Simon nicking my cheese,
is it?

01:14.310 --> 01:16.310
Guess so.

01:16.310 --> 01:17.990
Simon!

01:17.990 --> 01:21.310
He's not in.
Conveniently for you.

01:23.310 --> 01:26.310
Thought he had the day off.
Went out first thing.

01:30.310 --> 01:32.310
Here you go, maid.

01:34.310 --> 01:37.150
Got to be in early. Art project.

01:37.150 --> 01:39.310
Give you a lift to the bus
if you like.

01:39.310 --> 01:41.310
I'll walk.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.310
Dunno what time I'll be back.

03:28.310 --> 03:31.310
Ben!

03:31.310 --> 03:33.310
Can you come give me a hand, please?

03:36.310 --> 03:38.310
I'll do it.
No, you won't, you've got exams.

03:38.310 --> 03:41.310
Shit! I'm late.
Seriously, Mum, I'll do it later.

03:41.310 --> 03:43.510
No girl of mine's gonna feel
responsible for other people's mess.

03:43.510 --> 03:46.310
Ben!

03:46.310 --> 03:50.310
I got another message from Dad,
on Facebook.

03:51.310 --> 03:53.310
Wants to meet up.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.310
Yeah?

04:05.310 --> 04:07.990
Right. Yeah, I can be there, yeah,
20 minutes.

04:09.310 --> 04:12.150
Do not let your heart be troubled.

04:13.350 --> 04:15.830
You believe in God.

04:15.830 --> 04:18.310
Believe also in me.

04:18.310 --> 04:22.310
My Father's house has many rooms.

04:23.310 --> 04:26.310
And if it were not so,
would I have told you

04:26.310 --> 04:30.150
that I am going there
to prepare a room for you?

04:30.150 --> 04:32.310
If I go, prepare a place for you,

04:32.310 --> 04:36.310
I will come back
and bring you to me,

04:36.310 --> 04:39.310
that you may also be where I am.

05:09.310 --> 05:12.310
You know the worldly
aren't supposed to mourn with us.

05:13.310 --> 05:16.510
You made your choice
when you left us, Matthew.

05:23.990 --> 05:26.310
I think he would've wanted me here.

05:26.310 --> 05:30.310
I know. About your secret visits
to the hospice.

05:30.310 --> 05:33.310
I'm sure you thought you were
so clever, keeping it from me.

05:33.310 --> 05:35.310
Is that why you took him home
to die?

05:35.310 --> 05:37.830
Your father deserved some peace
for his final days.

05:40.150 --> 05:42.830
God knows you've given
neither of us that.

05:46.670 --> 05:52.670
Matthew. Come on, Brother Dennis,
we mustn't be late.

06:32.830 --> 06:36.310
'Sorry to disturb you, sir.
We have found a body at Crow Point.'

06:36.310 --> 06:38.310
Yeah. Who's on scene?

06:44.310 --> 06:47.310
Dog walker found him. It was
called in as a possible drowning.

06:47.310 --> 06:50.310
Bit of a cold day for swimming.
Ah. He's fully clothed.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.990
They thought the blood
might have been a propeller injury.

06:52.990 --> 06:54.990
Are we sure it isn't?
Yeah.

06:54.990 --> 06:56.990
I wouldn't have called you
otherwise.

06:56.990 --> 07:00.310
I know you had the morning off.
Funeral, was it?

07:02.310 --> 07:05.310
Anyone close?
My father's.

07:15.670 --> 07:18.310
All right? How did anyone think
this was an accident?

07:18.310 --> 07:20.670
He was face down when she found him.

07:20.670 --> 07:22.830
Plod turned him over.

07:26.310 --> 07:29.830
Any ID?
No wallet, no phone.

07:31.310 --> 07:33.310
This was in his pocket, though.

07:36.310 --> 07:38.310
I'll get over now with Jen.

07:53.310 --> 07:55.310
Are you the owner of the property?
Tenant.

07:55.310 --> 07:57.310
Caroline's at work.

07:57.310 --> 08:00.310
Are either of you married,
or have a male partner?

08:00.310 --> 08:02.310
Caz has a boyfriend, Ed.

08:02.310 --> 08:05.310
She works with him.
What's this about?

08:05.310 --> 08:07.310
A man was found dead this morning,
at Crow Point.

08:07.310 --> 08:10.310
We believe he had a connection
to this address.

08:10.310 --> 08:12.310
Simon?

08:12.310 --> 08:13.830
Who's Simon?

08:13.830 --> 08:16.310
Our lodger, Simon Walton.

08:16.310 --> 08:18.310
Have you got a photo?

08:29.310 --> 08:30.350
It's him, isn't it?

08:33.310 --> 08:35.310
Did he kill himself?

08:35.310 --> 08:36.310
What makes you say that?

08:36.310 --> 08:40.670
Just... wouldn't surprise me.
He was kind of a loner.

08:40.670 --> 08:44.990
He came here for a job,
cheffing in a hotel I think,

08:44.990 --> 08:46.310
but he lost it.

08:46.310 --> 08:49.310
Caroline's a social worker,
she offered him a bed,

08:49.310 --> 08:53.310
sorted him out a volunteering thing
at the cafe at the Woodyard.

08:54.670 --> 08:57.310
The Woodyard?
The community centre.

08:57.310 --> 08:59.310
I'm artist in residence there.

08:59.310 --> 09:01.310
Caz's dad is on
the board of trustees.

09:03.150 --> 09:04.510
Right.

09:06.310 --> 09:08.310
Can we have a look at his bedroom?

09:12.310 --> 09:14.310
Thanks.

09:15.830 --> 09:18.310
It's a bit sparse, innit?

09:32.310 --> 09:34.310
Any personal papers, files?

09:34.310 --> 09:36.350
I dunno. Don't think so.

09:36.350 --> 09:38.310
What about previous addresses,

09:38.310 --> 09:40.310
when he was born,
do you know any of that?

09:40.310 --> 09:42.310
His birthday is Christmas Eve,

09:42.310 --> 09:44.350
and he said he was 40 last year.

09:44.350 --> 09:46.310
That's all I know.

09:55.670 --> 09:58.350
Right, Alfie, I'm gonna say
that'll probably be enough.

09:58.350 --> 10:00.310
I think so, yeah.

10:00.310 --> 10:04.310
Hey! All right, cheers, Alfie.
I'll leave you to it.

10:05.310 --> 10:07.310
Jen, this is Jonathan.

10:07.310 --> 10:08.310
Hi.
Hi.

10:08.310 --> 10:11.310
Er... how was the funeral?

10:11.310 --> 10:16.310
Er... we're here to ask you
about something, actually.

10:16.310 --> 10:18.310
Simon Walton volunteered here?

10:18.310 --> 10:21.150
In the cafe, yeah.

10:22.310 --> 10:24.310
"Volunteered"?
Yeah.

10:25.310 --> 10:27.310
Shall we...
Yeah.

10:35.310 --> 10:37.510
Simon Walton, 40 years old,

10:37.510 --> 10:40.310
ID confirmed by his housemate
Gaby Chadwell.

10:40.310 --> 10:42.310
Lived a quiet life,
no run-ins with us

10:42.310 --> 10:43.350
or anyone else that we know of yet.

10:43.350 --> 10:48.310
Arrived in Ilfracombe six months ago
for a job at the Atlantic hotel.

10:48.310 --> 10:51.310
I spoke to the manager.
Apparently, he worked there a week

10:51.310 --> 10:53.310
and then just stopped turning up.

10:54.310 --> 10:56.310
Any idea why he left the job?

10:56.310 --> 10:58.310
No. Apparently, he was a good chef.

10:58.310 --> 11:00.310
So, he comes to a town
where he knows no-one,

11:00.310 --> 11:03.150
for a new job,
and quits after a week.

11:03.150 --> 11:04.350
Any friends he'd made here?

11:04.350 --> 11:07.310
No-one, apart from the two women
that he was living with.

11:07.310 --> 11:10.310
They got him a job,
volunteering at the Woodyard.

11:10.310 --> 11:12.830
He went there, pub, home, that's it.

11:12.830 --> 11:15.310
We're checking CCTV
of the bus route.

11:15.310 --> 11:17.310
He had a phone
but we can't find it,

11:17.310 --> 11:18.310
it seems likely the killer took it.

11:18.310 --> 11:21.150
The attack itself,
anything from forensics?

11:21.150 --> 11:23.310
Confirmed that he died at the scene,
single stab wound to the chest,

11:23.310 --> 11:25.310
no DNA as yet.

11:25.310 --> 11:28.310
Oh, there was a partial footprint
about ten metres from the body.

11:28.310 --> 11:30.310
Size five, as yet unidentified.

11:30.310 --> 11:32.310
A dog-walker's?
No.

11:32.310 --> 11:34.510
And below the tideline, so made
within a few hours of the murder.

11:34.510 --> 11:39.310
6:00pm last night, finishes work
at the Woodyard, heads home.

11:39.310 --> 11:41.670
Gaby Chadwell says she hears him
leaving the house this morning,

11:41.670 --> 11:43.310
maybe 6:00am.

11:43.310 --> 11:46.990
Apparently goes of his own volition
to Crow Point.

11:46.990 --> 11:49.310
Yeah, the housemate said he'd never
mentioned going there before.

11:51.310 --> 11:53.310
By 8:00am, he's dead.

11:53.310 --> 11:56.310
No witnesses, no forensics,

11:56.310 --> 11:58.310
no motive.

11:58.310 --> 12:02.990
We might have a motive.
I went through the PNC again.

12:02.990 --> 12:06.310
Simon Walton doesn't have
a criminal record.

12:06.310 --> 12:09.310
Simon Walden does.
Same date of birth.

12:09.310 --> 12:11.310
The housemates got his name wrong?

12:11.310 --> 12:13.510
He never had any post, they just
went by what he told them.

12:13.510 --> 12:15.310
They must've heard it wrong.

12:16.310 --> 12:20.310
So, Simon Walden.

12:20.310 --> 12:23.670
Was involved in a traffic collision
in Bristol four years ago.

12:23.670 --> 12:26.670
A child was killed.
Walden was drunk.

12:26.670 --> 12:29.350
Bloody hell.
Right.

12:31.310 --> 12:34.990
OK, I want everything you can dig up
on the child's parents.

12:34.990 --> 12:37.310
Press, interviews,
where they are now.

12:38.310 --> 12:40.310
Let's find out if we're dealing with
a revenge killing.

12:50.830 --> 12:53.310
Tea'll be in half an hour.
Pie and chips.

12:54.310 --> 12:58.310
You'll spoil your tea!
Think what your mother'd say.

12:58.310 --> 13:02.310
Not around to say it, is she?
Wouldn't be so sure.

13:03.350 --> 13:06.310
I'm doing her peas too, love,
don't you worry!

13:06.310 --> 13:10.310
Heard about this murder, then?
Poor sod at Crow Point?

13:11.310 --> 13:14.310
Oh, yeah. They're saying
he worked in the centre.

13:14.310 --> 13:17.310
In the caff. You know him?
Seen him around.

13:31.310 --> 13:34.310
Right, guys, I'm off.
Sir!

13:34.310 --> 13:37.670
NHS records list a wife
as next of kin.

13:37.670 --> 13:41.310
Ex, presumably. I've left her
a couple of voicemails.

13:41.310 --> 13:43.990
And also spoke to the team
who investigated the RTC.

13:43.990 --> 13:46.310
Walden got four years, out in two.

13:46.310 --> 13:48.350
The child's father was cautioned
for assaulting him

13:48.350 --> 13:50.310
a month after his release.

13:50.310 --> 13:53.310
Assaulting Walden?
Punched him in a supermarket.

13:53.310 --> 13:55.310
Fair enough, really.

13:56.310 --> 13:59.310
Family are still living in Bristol.
Right.

13:59.310 --> 14:01.310
Let's be on their doorstep
at 8:00am.

14:16.310 --> 14:19.310
You know, today, they brought
my dad in Dennis's car?

14:19.310 --> 14:23.310
They won't sully themselves
with a worldly funeral director.

14:23.310 --> 14:26.310
Dennis is the preacher guy?

14:26.310 --> 14:28.310
The Church Elder.

14:32.310 --> 14:34.310
Sure we did the right thing,
moving back?

14:38.310 --> 14:41.310
You had time with your dad.
That's what matters.

14:45.310 --> 14:49.310
This place isn't just theirs,
Matthew. It's yours, too.

14:49.310 --> 14:52.310
Has the last six months
not told you anything?

14:52.310 --> 14:54.150
You don't belong anywhere else.

14:57.310 --> 14:58.510
We'll toast him now.

15:01.310 --> 15:04.310
Oh, I... I've got an early start.

15:04.310 --> 15:08.310
Oh, just drink the bloody whisky.

15:15.670 --> 15:16.990
Cheers.

15:52.310 --> 15:54.310
Working late, sir?

15:56.670 --> 16:00.310
Had you had much contact
with Simon Walden recently? No.

16:02.150 --> 16:03.310
What about your wife?

16:06.310 --> 16:10.310
Neither of us wanted to see
or speak to that man ever again.

16:13.310 --> 16:16.310
Can you tell us where you were
yesterday morning?

16:16.310 --> 16:18.310
Really?

16:20.310 --> 16:21.670
A serious crime's been committed.

16:21.670 --> 16:25.310
A serious crime WAS committed.

16:25.310 --> 16:27.350
He killed our daughter.

16:27.350 --> 16:31.310
Rich, who is it?
It's... no-one.

16:32.990 --> 16:34.310
I was with a client
yesterday morning.

16:34.310 --> 16:36.310
My wife was at a toddler group.

16:37.310 --> 16:40.310
Now please just fuck off
before you upset my wife.

16:40.310 --> 16:43.310
I realise how hard this must be.
No, you don't!

16:43.310 --> 16:45.310
You don't.

16:54.310 --> 16:57.310
How old was the child?
Ten.

16:57.310 --> 16:59.310
He never mentioned an accident?

17:03.350 --> 17:06.350
You sorted out his volunteering job
at the Woodyard?

17:06.350 --> 17:10.310
Ed and I volunteer there sometimes.
We're both social workers.

17:10.310 --> 17:14.310
Trainee. I'm a trainee.
She's my boss.

17:14.310 --> 17:16.310
Did anyone ever come here
looking for him?

17:16.310 --> 17:20.310
I don't think anyone knew
he was here. So, why was he?

17:20.310 --> 17:23.310
Other than a job
that he left after a week?

17:23.310 --> 17:25.310
Was he over the limit?

17:25.310 --> 17:27.310
When he hit the kid?

17:28.670 --> 17:30.310
He was, yeah.

17:43.310 --> 17:45.310
Was he a drinker, then?

17:45.310 --> 17:48.990
He was good at looking sober.
But yeah, he drank.

17:51.310 --> 17:52.310
At home? Pub?

17:52.310 --> 17:54.510
The Wheatsheaf, down the road.

17:54.510 --> 17:56.310
By himself?

17:56.310 --> 17:59.310
I saw him in there
with a woman once.

17:59.310 --> 18:01.310
Only time I saw him with someone.

18:01.310 --> 18:03.310
It looked intense.

18:05.310 --> 18:06.510
Would you recognise her?

18:06.510 --> 18:09.310
Only saw the back of her head.

18:11.310 --> 18:14.310
So, why did you ask if he was over
the limit when he hit the kid?

18:15.310 --> 18:16.350
The tattoo.

18:20.310 --> 18:22.990
An albatross around the neck.

18:27.150 --> 18:30.310
No offence, but you don't look like
a trainee social worker.

18:31.310 --> 18:36.310
Yeah. I... I used to work
in corporate accountancy.

18:36.310 --> 18:39.310
Gave it all up a year ago.
Why?

18:39.310 --> 18:42.310
Burn out.
Hated myself, hated my life.

18:42.310 --> 18:45.310
Simon probably came here
for the same reason I did.

18:45.310 --> 18:47.310
A different sort of life,

18:47.310 --> 18:49.310
where you don't wake up
every morning

18:49.310 --> 18:50.310
wanting to kill yourself.

18:55.990 --> 18:58.310
Let's make sure we speak to
the FLO of the dead child's family.

18:58.310 --> 18:59.830
Their alibis might hold up

18:59.830 --> 19:02.310
but it doesn't mean they didn't
solicit someone to attack him.

19:02.310 --> 19:05.350
Ross, yo!
Have we spoken to the ex-wife yet?

19:05.350 --> 19:07.310
Living in Spain
with her new partner.

19:07.310 --> 19:09.310
She hasn't seen or heard from Walden

19:09.310 --> 19:11.310
since she got divorced
when he was inside.

19:12.310 --> 19:15.310
OK. Jen,
Wheatsheaf pub in Ilfracombe,

19:15.310 --> 19:17.310
presuming you know it?

19:17.310 --> 19:19.310
Apparently,
Walden met with a woman there.

19:19.310 --> 19:21.310
I want you to head over there
and see what they know.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.670
"Presuming you know it"?

19:25.670 --> 19:27.310
It's just your vibe.

19:27.310 --> 19:31.310
Fuck off.
As if he's never set foot in a pub!

19:31.310 --> 19:33.310
Probably hasn't. Grew up in a cult.

19:33.310 --> 19:35.310
What? Did he?

19:36.310 --> 19:40.310
Oh, hey, did that bloke find you
this morning?

19:40.310 --> 19:42.310
What bloke?

19:42.310 --> 19:45.310
He was at the desk,
he was asking after you.

19:45.310 --> 19:47.310
But he... he didn't leave a name.

20:18.310 --> 20:20.310
Yeah, he comes in all the time.

20:22.310 --> 20:25.150
Was he ever with anyone?

20:25.150 --> 20:28.310
Nah, just sat in the corner
with his back turned.

20:29.510 --> 20:33.310
You never saw him with a woman?
I did once, actually.

20:33.310 --> 20:35.310
I think he was breaking up with her
or something.

20:35.310 --> 20:37.310
Can you tell me
what she looked like?

20:39.310 --> 20:42.350
Dark-haired,
thirties, forties, I guess.

20:43.350 --> 20:47.510
Right. If you remember any more,
give me call?

20:51.310 --> 20:53.310
Can I call you
if I don't remember?

21:16.150 --> 21:17.310
DS Rafferty?

21:17.310 --> 21:19.310
Did you follow me from the station?

21:19.310 --> 21:22.310
I'm sorry. I wanted to speak to you
in private.

21:22.310 --> 21:23.510
Christopher Reasley.

21:27.310 --> 21:29.310
Are you Caroline's father?

21:29.310 --> 21:31.350
Can I buy you a coffee?

21:31.350 --> 21:35.310
I went to see Walden
a few days before his death.

21:35.310 --> 21:37.310
Asked him to move out.

21:38.310 --> 21:41.150
Why? Would you want
some random homeless guy

21:41.150 --> 21:42.670
living with your daughter?

21:44.670 --> 21:47.310
How did he react?
Told me to piss off.

21:47.310 --> 21:50.310
That Caroline had prewarned him
about me.

21:50.310 --> 21:54.310
The thing about Caroline is,
she loves a lame duck.

21:55.310 --> 21:58.310
Couldn't you have just talked to her
about it?

21:58.310 --> 22:01.510
Her mum was ill.

22:01.510 --> 22:04.150
Depression.

22:04.150 --> 22:08.310
And then she died
when Caroline was six. Car accident.

22:09.310 --> 22:12.310
And Caroline blames you
for surviving?

22:16.510 --> 22:19.310
I checked the rotas at the Woodyard.

22:19.310 --> 22:22.310
Caroline used to volunteer there
quite regularly.

22:22.310 --> 22:25.310
And then Simon started,
she stopped.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.310
Any idea why?

22:28.310 --> 22:30.350
I asked them to take her
off the rota.

22:30.350 --> 22:34.310
I was trying to have her spend as
little time as possible with Simon.

22:34.310 --> 22:38.310
They were already housemates.
I was hoping not for much longer.

22:38.310 --> 22:42.310
Look, he was an odd guy. Secretive.

22:43.310 --> 22:46.310
You know that he gave the girls
a false name?

22:50.310 --> 22:51.830
Did you ask him about it?

22:51.830 --> 22:54.310
He said it was none of my business.

22:54.310 --> 22:56.310
I disagreed.

22:56.310 --> 23:00.310
It... it wasn't an argument, but...

23:00.310 --> 23:04.310
Given that he ended up dead
not long after...

23:06.310 --> 23:07.310
Right.

23:10.670 --> 23:14.310
I'd appreciate you not mentioning
any of this to Caroline.

23:16.310 --> 23:17.310
I won't if I don't have to.

23:41.310 --> 23:43.310
Matthew?

23:43.310 --> 23:46.310
Oh, I was... I was just...
Please, please.

23:48.510 --> 23:54.310
We noticed yesterday how sad some of
the Brethren graves were looking.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.510
Your father
would've wanted you there.

23:59.510 --> 24:02.310
Your mother knows it too.

24:03.310 --> 24:04.310
I have something for you.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.310
Come round tonight
and I'll give it to you.

24:06.310 --> 24:09.310
Seven o'clock sharp.

24:13.310 --> 24:17.310
Have you noticed anything
up with Lucy recently?

24:17.310 --> 24:19.310
She's hiding things, lying.

24:19.310 --> 24:22.310
Lying? About what?

24:22.310 --> 24:25.310
I don't know.

24:25.310 --> 24:26.310
It's probably nothing.

24:26.310 --> 24:29.310
Maurice, sit down.

24:31.310 --> 24:35.310
You know, it's not that long
since youse lost Helen.

24:35.310 --> 24:38.310
Lucy's doing better than me.

24:39.310 --> 24:41.310
Least, I thought she was.

24:42.310 --> 24:44.310
I don't know.

24:45.310 --> 24:47.310
You know what she's like.

24:47.310 --> 24:49.310
Confident.

24:49.310 --> 24:51.310
I'm worried about her judgement.

24:51.310 --> 24:53.310
People taking advantage.

24:54.310 --> 24:58.310
Have you thought any more about
what we talked about before?

24:58.310 --> 25:01.310
We're muddling along fine.

25:01.310 --> 25:04.310
There's great supported
accommodation in Ilfracombe,

25:04.310 --> 25:07.310
loads of young people Lucy's age...

25:07.310 --> 25:11.310
Like I said, we're fine.

25:12.310 --> 25:14.310
Thanks again for your time,
Mr Roberts.

25:25.310 --> 25:28.310
A single stab wound, made
with a sharp blade around 15cm long.

25:28.310 --> 25:29.990
No sign of a struggle.
What does that suggest?

25:31.310 --> 25:32.310
The attacker surprised him?

25:32.310 --> 25:36.310
Or that he was already with them,
talking, face-on.

25:36.310 --> 25:38.310
Entry point and force suggests
the attacker

25:38.310 --> 25:41.310
was shorter than Walden,
who was 6' 2".

25:43.310 --> 25:45.310
Footprint's size five.

25:45.310 --> 25:46.310
Whoever killed him was careful,

25:46.310 --> 25:48.310
took his phone and ID
to slow us down.

25:48.310 --> 25:49.510
They wouldn't leave a footprint.

25:49.510 --> 25:52.310
Whose is it then?

25:59.310 --> 26:01.310
Hey.

26:02.310 --> 26:04.830
No, no, you go ahead and eat.
I can get something here.

26:06.310 --> 26:09.310
You too. All right.

26:14.310 --> 26:18.510
Boss, tuna mayo?
If you want it, my hands are clean.

26:19.670 --> 26:24.310
You've got a baby, right?
Yeah. Emily. She's eight months.

26:24.310 --> 26:27.310
Go on. Go home to her.

26:47.310 --> 26:48.350
Hello, Matthew.

26:50.310 --> 26:51.310
Dennis.

27:05.310 --> 27:08.310
Always kept it by his bed.

27:10.310 --> 27:14.310
He told me that you'd been in
to see him in the hospice.

27:14.310 --> 27:17.310
At our meeting times,
to avoid seeing your mother.

27:18.350 --> 27:22.310
I know she hasn't made it easy.

27:28.310 --> 27:31.310
Do you remember
when you were a boy,

27:31.310 --> 27:35.310
and you went to see a film at
a friend's house, and she found out,

27:35.310 --> 27:38.310
and we made you stand up
at out next meeting and repent?

27:39.310 --> 27:43.310
Well, she was always worried
about my soul. And rightly so.

27:44.310 --> 27:49.310
You're living with your... friend?
Jonathan, is it?

27:50.670 --> 27:52.310
Er... yeah.

27:52.310 --> 27:54.510
He's the one who wanted
to move here.

27:54.510 --> 27:58.310
He found the house.
He's doing it up.

27:58.310 --> 28:01.310
He knew you were ready to come home.

28:02.310 --> 28:05.310
All adventurers do, in the end.

28:06.310 --> 28:08.310
Oh, I'd erm...

28:08.310 --> 28:10.310
I'd hardly call myself
an adventurer.

28:10.310 --> 28:13.350
No, no,
took courage to do what you did.

28:15.310 --> 28:17.310
Go out and make your own way.

28:18.310 --> 28:20.310
Well, I... I didn't have a choice.

28:20.310 --> 28:21.310
What?

28:23.310 --> 28:25.310
Well, I wasn't welcome here.

28:26.310 --> 28:32.310
When I stood up in the meeting
and I told you all I didn't believe,

28:32.310 --> 28:34.310
that I thought it was all...

28:34.310 --> 28:37.510
"Utter madness"
is the term I recall.

28:37.510 --> 28:41.310
Ah, you were young, confused.

28:42.830 --> 28:45.310
It's not a sin to doubt sometimes.

28:46.310 --> 28:51.310
I just wish you'd given us a chance.
to help you re-find the light.

28:53.310 --> 28:54.310
Wha...

28:56.310 --> 28:59.310
My mother said that there
was a church meeting.

28:59.310 --> 29:04.310
That... that you voted on it.
That I had to leave.

29:04.310 --> 29:06.990
You had to leave the church,
of course.

29:06.990 --> 29:10.670
Nobody ever said
you had to leave your family.

29:15.310 --> 29:18.310
Excuse me.

29:18.310 --> 29:20.310
Mine. Sorry.

29:30.310 --> 29:31.310
Hey.

29:31.310 --> 29:32.990
I've checked the bus CCTV,

29:32.990 --> 29:34.310
I've found Simon sitting
with a woman,

29:34.310 --> 29:36.310
he talks to her
on four separate occasions.

29:36.310 --> 29:39.150
Have we spoken to the driver?
Already done.

29:39.150 --> 29:42.310
Driver's ID'd her as a young woman
from Lovacott, Lucy Craddle.

29:42.310 --> 29:45.310
She's a student
at the Woodyard day centre.

29:51.310 --> 29:52.830
Caroline? It's Dad!

30:01.310 --> 30:03.310
I know you're in there!

30:06.310 --> 30:09.310
Caroline, please let me in.

30:20.310 --> 30:21.510
Ella?

30:23.310 --> 30:25.310
Ben?

30:26.510 --> 30:28.510
Where are you?

30:28.510 --> 30:31.310
Are you gonna eat there?

30:31.310 --> 30:33.310
Yeah, are you sure?

30:33.310 --> 30:36.350
OK, see you back here at ten then,
please...

30:36.350 --> 30:38.310
Oh.

31:13.310 --> 31:16.310
Do you ever wish
you hadn't left London?

31:17.310 --> 31:19.350
I didn't belong in London.

31:21.310 --> 31:23.350
Instead, I'm here with you.

31:25.510 --> 31:29.310
Living by the sea.
Waking up next to you.

31:31.310 --> 31:33.310
Can you stay tonight?

31:33.310 --> 31:35.310
Yeah.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.310
I'll have to turn my pants
inside-out for work.

31:37.310 --> 31:40.310
You should keep some stuff here.

31:42.310 --> 31:43.310
All your stuff.

31:45.310 --> 31:46.990
Are you asking me to move in?

31:46.990 --> 31:49.310
I think I might be.

31:57.350 --> 32:01.310
How was work?
I wasn't at work.

32:05.310 --> 32:06.510
I went to see Dennis Stephenson.

32:08.310 --> 32:09.990
The elder guy?

32:11.310 --> 32:13.310
He gave me this.

32:17.310 --> 32:19.310
It's my Dad's.

32:22.310 --> 32:24.310
I stayed for dinner.

32:26.310 --> 32:28.310
You know they're after your soul.
Too late.

32:28.310 --> 32:31.310
I'll burn in hell
with the rest of you.

32:33.310 --> 32:35.310
Thank God.

32:46.150 --> 32:47.990
Yeah, I'm coming.

32:50.310 --> 32:52.310
Mum, door for you.

32:58.510 --> 33:01.990
I know he's in there. It's Ross.

33:06.310 --> 33:08.990
Morning.
Hiya.

33:16.310 --> 33:18.310
Oi, oi.

33:40.350 --> 33:44.310
What did you and Simon talk about?
The Woodyard.

33:44.310 --> 33:46.310
Him moving down from Bristol.

33:47.990 --> 33:50.310
Did he say why he'd moved here?

33:50.310 --> 33:52.310
He said he'd done something bad.

33:52.310 --> 33:54.310
An accident, was it?

33:54.310 --> 33:55.310
Involving a child?

33:55.310 --> 33:59.310
He said the mum
been down to see him.

34:03.310 --> 34:05.150
Er... sorry, did he say why?

34:05.150 --> 34:07.310
Or what she'd wanted?

34:09.310 --> 34:13.150
No. OK, thanks.

34:15.310 --> 34:20.310
Erm... where were you on Tuesday,
between 6:00 and 8:00am?

34:20.310 --> 34:23.310
We just have to ask
for our records. Here.

34:23.310 --> 34:26.310
Digging spuds with your old man,
weren't you, maid?

34:26.310 --> 34:29.310
Maid?
Er... she's not from round here.

34:30.510 --> 34:32.310
Thank you very much for your time.

34:40.310 --> 34:42.310
Why did you say that?

34:42.310 --> 34:43.830
What?

34:43.830 --> 34:47.310
Tuesday was the morning
you left early.

34:47.310 --> 34:49.310
Said you had to be in class.

34:55.310 --> 34:58.310
You all right, Ross?
You wanna wait here? Yes, boss.

35:02.310 --> 35:05.310
'Hello?'
Mrs Chorley? It's DI Venn.

35:05.310 --> 35:07.350
'My husband already told you,
we're not interested.'

35:07.350 --> 35:09.310
We know you went to see Walden.

35:10.350 --> 35:14.830
He wrote to me a few months ago,
just after he'd moved there.

35:14.830 --> 35:20.310
He... said he thought he could find
some sort of peace there.

35:20.310 --> 35:22.310
Or at least escape.

35:22.310 --> 35:23.310
But he hadn't.

35:24.310 --> 35:28.310
What he did to Amy,
it followed him.

35:29.830 --> 35:32.310
Did your husband know
that you went to see Walden?

35:35.310 --> 35:37.670
Why did you?
It's hard to explain.

35:37.670 --> 35:41.310
I just needed to see him.

35:42.670 --> 35:45.310
We went for a drink.
In the Wheatsheaf pub?

35:49.310 --> 35:54.150
Losing your daughter, I can't...

35:54.150 --> 35:56.310
I can't imagine how hard
that must have been.

35:57.310 --> 36:01.310
I have a daughter,
and if anything happened to her,

36:01.310 --> 36:04.310
I swear to God I wouldn't be
responsible for my actions.

36:06.310 --> 36:07.310
What, you think I killed him?

36:07.310 --> 36:09.310
We're just following the evidence.

36:10.350 --> 36:13.310
To be honest, I felt bound to him.

36:14.310 --> 36:17.310
To Walden?
Everyone else had moved on.

36:17.310 --> 36:20.310
But he still felt
the same pain I did.

36:22.310 --> 36:26.310
You and Walden...
No, it wasn't like that.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.310
No, I just needed to see him.

36:29.310 --> 36:33.310
He said in his letter that he was
thinking about ending it all.

36:33.310 --> 36:35.310
Suppose I wanted to forgive him.

36:35.310 --> 36:38.310
Or for him to feel like I had.

36:38.310 --> 36:41.310
We'll need to see it, the letter.

37:00.310 --> 37:02.310
What's this about the money?

37:02.310 --> 37:04.310
From the house sale,
after his divorce.

37:04.310 --> 37:06.150
I didn't take it.

37:07.310 --> 37:10.310
How much did he want to give you?

37:10.310 --> 37:12.310
200 grand was transferred
into Walden's account.

37:12.310 --> 37:15.310
£200,000, and he was living
in destitution?

37:15.310 --> 37:17.310
Yeah. Through choice, it seems.

37:17.310 --> 37:19.310
This is where it gets interesting,
right.

37:19.310 --> 37:22.310
The night before his death,
the whole amount is transferred

37:22.310 --> 37:24.310
out of his current account
via an online payment service.

37:24.310 --> 37:26.310
We dunno where it's gone.
Need a court order

37:26.310 --> 37:28.310
before the payment site
will release details.

37:28.310 --> 37:30.310
Well, get on it.
Find out where the money went.

37:30.310 --> 37:34.310
And erm... try not to fuck any more
witnesses as well, yeah?

37:34.310 --> 37:38.310
Wasn't a bloody witness.

37:43.310 --> 37:45.310
Speak to a fellow officer
like that again,

37:45.310 --> 37:47.310
and you'll be logging evidence
for the remainder of this case.

37:48.350 --> 37:51.150
Understood?

37:51.150 --> 37:53.310
Yeah. Sorry.

37:58.310 --> 38:00.310
Boss? Your mum rang.

38:00.310 --> 38:01.310
Sorry?

38:01.310 --> 38:04.310
Her neighbour's daughter,
Rosa Shapland, 19 years old,

38:04.310 --> 38:06.310
hasn't been seen since this morning

38:06.310 --> 38:07.350
and the family
can't get hold of her.

38:07.350 --> 38:10.310
Your mum asked if you could go over.

38:19.310 --> 38:23.310
Is it a cult, then?
It's an Evangelical Church.

38:23.310 --> 38:26.310
The Barum Brethren. Is that the ones
that ban TV and that?

38:26.310 --> 38:31.310
TV's not banned as such, it's just
seen as a worldly temptation.

38:33.310 --> 38:34.310
OK.

38:34.310 --> 38:37.830
I mean, as a little kid,
it was... it was great.

38:37.830 --> 38:42.830
And then you remember
what they believe.

38:42.830 --> 38:45.150
Which is what?

38:45.150 --> 38:46.510
That on the day of rapture,

38:46.510 --> 38:49.310
God will sweep all of them
up to heaven

38:49.310 --> 38:52.310
and the rest of us
will burn in hell.

38:53.310 --> 38:54.510
Take it they're not keen
on the gays?

38:54.510 --> 38:59.310
Sodomy is definitely
on the banned list.

39:02.310 --> 39:05.310
So you... ran away?

39:05.310 --> 39:07.310
Mmm.

39:33.310 --> 39:37.830
The Woodyard said she never
came back after lunch.

39:37.830 --> 39:40.150
She's a good girl,

39:40.150 --> 39:43.150
it's not like her to skive.

39:43.150 --> 39:45.310
How long
has she been volunteering there?

39:45.310 --> 39:48.310
Three months.
Just one day a week.

39:48.310 --> 39:50.310
Has she got a phone?

39:50.310 --> 39:53.310
We got her one,
for the days she goes there.

39:55.990 --> 39:58.310
I've been trying it for hours.

40:02.670 --> 40:04.310
Is there anywhere else
that she might be?

40:04.310 --> 40:06.310
Relatives, hobbies?

40:08.310 --> 40:10.150
Not outside the church.

40:11.310 --> 40:15.510
She does her baking and her knitting
and whatnot.

40:17.990 --> 40:20.310
She does like going round
the charity shops,

40:20.310 --> 40:22.310
trying to find a bargain.

40:24.310 --> 40:27.310
She's probably there now,
and forgot the time.

40:27.310 --> 40:29.670
I shouldn't be wasting your time
like this,

40:29.670 --> 40:32.310
only Dorothy said we should call.

40:32.310 --> 40:35.310
Well, we'd heard about the murder
at Crow Point.

40:35.310 --> 40:37.670
He came to one of our meetings.

40:39.310 --> 40:41.310
Simon Walden
was at a church meeting?

40:42.310 --> 40:46.310
Rosa invited him.
She knew him from the centre.

40:46.310 --> 40:49.310
I think she was surprised
when he turned up.

40:49.310 --> 40:51.310
When was this?

40:51.310 --> 40:54.310
Erm... a month ago?
Yes.

40:54.310 --> 40:59.830
Maybe? I did see him
talking to Rosa after.

40:59.830 --> 41:02.310
Yes, it seemed odd.

41:02.310 --> 41:04.510
Now it seems worrying.

41:07.310 --> 41:10.150
It's likely she'll turn up
of her own accord.

41:10.150 --> 41:12.310
But we do need some recent photos,

41:12.310 --> 41:15.310
you know, just so we can start
routine enquiries.

41:15.310 --> 41:18.990
Erm... I'll see if I can find one.

41:22.310 --> 41:24.310
Can I take a look at her room?

42:14.310 --> 42:15.670
I spoke to Dennis, Mum.

42:18.310 --> 42:21.310
It wasn't the church that said
I had to leave my family, was it?

42:21.310 --> 42:22.310
It was just you.

42:25.990 --> 42:28.310
You chose your own path, Matthew.

42:29.310 --> 42:31.670
Now it's led you back to us.

42:34.310 --> 42:40.150
I wanted to remind my fellow
brothers and sisters

42:40.150 --> 42:42.830
of the importance of second chances.

42:42.830 --> 42:45.310
We are very quick,
in the Barum Brethren,

42:45.310 --> 42:47.310
to close ranks.

42:48.310 --> 42:53.310
But we must be equally ready
to open our arms in welcome,

42:53.310 --> 42:56.310
to greet newcomers,

42:56.310 --> 43:00.830
but also to embrace those
who have strayed,

43:00.830 --> 43:03.310
who now seek to come home.

43:20.310 --> 43:22.310
Hey!
Hey. Hope you're hungry.

43:22.310 --> 43:24.310
That was quick.
Yeah.

44:49.310 --> 44:52.150
Where are you going, my love?

44:57.150 --> 44:59.830
Take your coat off
and go back to bed.

45:03.310 --> 45:05.510
Right now.

45:12.310 --> 45:15.310
Sir, there's been a 999 call.

45:17.830 --> 45:20.310
'999, what's your emergency?'

45:25.310 --> 45:28.310
'Hello? Can you tell me
what service you require?

45:34.150 --> 45:35.310
'Hello?'

45:35.310 --> 45:38.310
'My name's Rosa.
I need to get home.'

45:38.310 --> 45:41.310
'OK. Can you tell me where you are?'

45:47.350 --> 45:49.310
'He's coming.'

45:50.310 --> 45:52.310
So, it's an abduction.

45:56.830 --> 45:59.310
