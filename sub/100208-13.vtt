11:41.222 --> 11:43.790
[exhales]
Let's see the juice.

11:43.833 --> 11:45.313
What?

11:45.356 --> 11:47.358
Okay.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.928
This is how Father
Shane used it.

11:57.804 --> 12:00.067
That is top-of-the-line
holy water.

12:06.160 --> 12:07.074
Nancy?

12:07.117 --> 12:09.337
Oh, my God, Nancy?

12:09.380 --> 12:10.599
Check her airway.

12:10.642 --> 12:12.383
She's breathing.
GEORGE: Nancy?

12:12.427 --> 12:14.429
Can you hear us?

12:14.472 --> 12:15.735
Nancy?

12:18.694 --> 12:20.174
Here.

12:20.217 --> 12:23.003
Nancy! Guys, we got to
get her out of here.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.744
Come on. Okay... Help me get her up.

12:24.787 --> 12:26.746
[grunts]
Okay. Here we go.

12:26.789 --> 12:30.140
Okay. On three. One, two, three.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.881
[grunts]

12:31.925 --> 12:33.404
[groans]
Oh!

12:33.448 --> 12:34.928
Oh, my God!

12:34.971 --> 12:36.799
I don't think the Whisper
Box wants her to leave.

12:36.843 --> 12:38.845
Put her back down!
Put her back down!

12:38.888 --> 12:39.976
GEORGE:
Okay, Bess, okay.

12:40.020 --> 12:41.021
[panting]:
Okay.

12:45.286 --> 12:46.548
[straining]

12:46.591 --> 12:49.464
Okay. This is ridiculous.

12:49.507 --> 12:50.900
You know what
we need? The key?

12:50.944 --> 12:52.946
Yeah.

12:52.989 --> 12:54.948
Who sold you this shoddy house

12:54.991 --> 12:56.471
with one completely
impregnable door?

12:56.514 --> 12:57.777
Oh.

12:57.820 --> 12:59.691
Ryan Hudson. Terrific guy.

12:59.735 --> 13:00.954
[laughs]

13:00.997 --> 13:03.652
Of course.

13:03.695 --> 13:06.524
Yeah, okay,
let's go meet fake Ryan Hudson.

13:10.311 --> 13:11.878
GEORGE:
Nancy!

13:11.921 --> 13:13.880
[all panting]

13:17.013 --> 13:18.710
Now what?

13:28.111 --> 13:30.679
Pulse is steady
but it's really weak.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.681
It's the room. It's killing her.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.161
Well, that's why
I wanted to get her out! Okay, Nick!

13:34.204 --> 13:36.163
You can't, okay? You
saw what happened.

13:36.206 --> 13:37.991
So if she stays here, she dies.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.862
We try to take her out,
she dies faster?

13:39.906 --> 13:41.037
What are we supposed to do? I don't know!

13:41.081 --> 13:42.169
Nick, hey! What are we supposed to do?

13:42.212 --> 13:43.474
Huh?
BESS: Hey!

13:43.518 --> 13:45.737
Hey! This is
up to Nancy!

13:45.781 --> 13:49.002
She's got to find her way out.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.315
RYAN:
Thinking we'll put a swing set

13:58.359 --> 13:59.621
right-right here.

13:59.664 --> 14:01.275
Kids love swing sets.
MAN: Okay.

14:01.318 --> 14:03.886
Nancy, did you move off to NYC

14:03.930 --> 14:06.628
and forget about how important
your hometown still is?

14:06.671 --> 14:08.108
[chuckles]
Hey.

14:08.151 --> 14:09.152
Can you give us a
second, please?

14:09.196 --> 14:10.893
Sure. Thank you.

14:10.937 --> 14:14.027
So, Tiffany and I are
breaking ground on a new center

14:14.070 --> 14:15.855
for at-risk youth.

14:15.898 --> 14:17.204
Congrats.
Thanks.

14:17.247 --> 14:18.988
NICK:
Uh, so, Ryan,

14:19.032 --> 14:20.990
well, w-we wanted
to ask you about,

14:21.034 --> 14:22.470
uh, the house you sold me.

14:22.513 --> 14:24.994
Oh, right, yeah, the
money pit, and I say that

14:25.038 --> 14:26.648
as a term of affection. You know that
door upstairs?

14:26.691 --> 14:28.215
The one with the
unopenable lock?

14:28.258 --> 14:29.477
It's really important that...

14:29.520 --> 14:31.958
NICK:
Oh, that I open it.

14:33.046 --> 14:35.004
So, do you have the key?

14:35.048 --> 14:38.007
Okay, is this a test?

14:38.051 --> 14:40.923
[laughing]:
You don't remember?

14:40.967 --> 14:42.664
The only one that has the key,

14:42.707 --> 14:44.231
Nancy, is you.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.059
You don't say.

14:46.102 --> 14:48.626
I do. Remember,
you solved the mystery

14:48.670 --> 14:50.890
of my grandparents' fake will
when you were 14?

14:50.933 --> 14:52.500
You found the real
will in that room,

14:52.543 --> 14:55.720
next to the bootlegger's
stash of dangerous chemicals.

14:55.764 --> 14:58.898
So Nancy hid the key?

14:58.941 --> 15:00.769
Why? Because I told her to.

15:00.812 --> 15:02.205
Yeah, that room was just...

15:02.249 --> 15:04.425
it was a shrine
to-to a criminal empire

15:04.468 --> 15:07.167
that my family
used to run, and I...

15:07.210 --> 15:08.951
I didn't want to see it again.

15:08.995 --> 15:10.997
But you did leave me
with a set of clues.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.043
Like a "break glass in case of emergency."

15:14.087 --> 15:15.871
Yeah, I did.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.613
Ryan, break the glass.

15:18.656 --> 15:21.616
"12 steps from the sweet angel,

15:21.659 --> 15:24.401
take a right at the farmer's wife.

15:24.445 --> 15:26.621
Under the shadow of both
devoted grandparents,

15:26.664 --> 15:29.798
find the belly

15:29.841 --> 15:32.192
of the hollow oak."

15:32.235 --> 15:34.194
NICK:
You don't know what
any of that means.

15:34.237 --> 15:35.630
Not yet.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.849
Hey, Ned.
Hey.

15:37.893 --> 15:40.852
[wind whistling]

16:03.136 --> 16:05.138
[sighing]

16:08.184 --> 16:10.056
[screams]

16:10.099 --> 16:12.928
Hey, what's-what's
wrong? What's wrong?

16:12.972 --> 16:14.669
[panting]

16:14.712 --> 16:16.323
You okay?

16:16.366 --> 16:18.107
Yeah.
Yeah.

16:22.198 --> 16:23.939
There's that symbol again.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.029
What does it mean?

16:27.073 --> 16:29.292
I don't know.

16:29.336 --> 16:31.947
Okay, here's the deal.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.601
None of you exist,
but I still need your help.

16:33.644 --> 16:34.906
So if anybody has
a problem with that,

16:34.950 --> 16:35.951
that's totally cool.
Oh.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.083
Ace.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.998
Are you gonna want
to order anything?

16:39.041 --> 16:40.129
Might I suggest dessert?

16:40.173 --> 16:41.522
Okay, yeah, sure.

16:41.565 --> 16:43.045
Since none of this
is real anyway,

16:43.089 --> 16:44.046
yes, let's order dessert.

16:44.090 --> 16:46.483
[whispers]:
On it.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.050
We are looking for the key

16:48.094 --> 16:50.009
to the mystery door
in Nick's house.

16:50.052 --> 16:52.011
Uh, Ryan Hudson
left us three clues.

16:52.054 --> 16:56.276
A sweet angel, farmer's wife,
and devoted grandparents.

16:56.319 --> 16:59.018
eBay usernames. Country music lyrics.

16:59.061 --> 17:00.149
Rejected names of drinks. Wrestling moves.

17:00.193 --> 17:01.977
Strippers.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.283
[music playing softly]

17:03.326 --> 17:04.936
Yes.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.721
Here you go.

17:06.764 --> 17:08.462
Death by dessert.
Next stop, cemetery.

17:08.505 --> 17:10.725
Oh, my God, that's it.

17:10.768 --> 17:12.944
You said you wanted dessert.

17:12.988 --> 17:14.207
No, no, no, no, no, no.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.730
Cemetery.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.514
Right. Right, right,
right, right.

17:17.558 --> 17:19.429
U-Uh, sweet angel, farmer's
wife, devoted grandparents.

17:19.473 --> 17:22.867
Phrases found on gravestones.

17:22.911 --> 17:25.131
I hid the key in the cemetery.

17:26.306 --> 17:29.178
Hey, has anyone seen my beanie?

17:35.532 --> 17:37.230
Are you okay?

17:37.273 --> 17:40.146
My doctor, uh...

17:40.189 --> 17:42.887
I just got a message from him.

17:42.931 --> 17:45.151
And he wants me to call back.

17:47.544 --> 17:49.285
Why?

17:50.808 --> 17:54.682
Um, last month,
during my physical,

17:54.725 --> 17:56.945
they found something suspicious.

17:56.988 --> 17:58.251
So I went,

17:58.294 --> 18:00.209
I went back for a
series of blood tests

18:00.253 --> 18:02.994
and now the results are in.

18:03.038 --> 18:05.997
Do you want me to sit with you
while you call?

18:14.223 --> 18:17.531
Hi. It's Kate Drew.

18:17.574 --> 18:19.315
I got your message.

18:19.359 --> 18:23.189
Um, you have the results?

18:23.232 --> 18:25.191
Uh-huh. Okay.

18:25.234 --> 18:26.453
Thank you.

18:26.496 --> 18:28.063

18:38.421 --> 18:41.381
Oh, sweetie, I was so scared.

18:41.424 --> 18:43.383

[sniffles]

18:43.426 --> 18:45.994
Yeah, yeah.

18:46.037 --> 18:47.561
Yeah, me, too.

18:47.604 --> 18:49.563
[laughs]

18:49.606 --> 18:51.391
Oh...

18:51.434 --> 18:54.394
CARSON:
All right, honey.
We got to get a move on.

18:56.396 --> 18:58.311
Oh, no.

18:58.354 --> 19:00.617
What am I missing?

19:00.661 --> 19:03.359
Nothing at all.
[laughs]

19:03.403 --> 19:04.795
Take me to dinner.

19:04.839 --> 19:07.146
I will tell you all
about it on the way.

19:10.497 --> 19:12.281
Ned.

19:12.325 --> 19:15.763
Oh, hi. Uh, Mr. Drew, Mrs. Drew.

19:15.806 --> 19:18.200
Are we expecting a power outage?

19:18.244 --> 19:21.290
Nick and I are-are
working on his case.

19:21.334 --> 19:24.511
Oh.
Well, come on, Counselor.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.513
The Historical Society's
not gonna honor itself.

19:26.556 --> 19:29.298
Your beanie is
in the living room.

[mouths]

19:33.607 --> 19:35.609
[thunder rumbling]

19:37.872 --> 19:40.135
It's really pouring out.

19:40.179 --> 19:42.181
So? We get a little wet.

19:44.444 --> 19:47.403
Oh. Or, uh,
or a lot of wet. Wow.

19:47.447 --> 19:50.450
So, here's a thought.

19:50.493 --> 19:52.016
We wait out the storm.

19:52.060 --> 19:54.018
A radical idea, I know.

19:54.062 --> 19:55.933
But pouring rain,

19:55.977 --> 19:59.546
muddy cemetery
versus warm living room.

20:02.244 --> 20:04.420
The key is out there, and
the quicker that I find it...

20:04.464 --> 20:06.727
The quicker you go home, I know.

20:06.770 --> 20:08.424
As soon as it stops, we'll go.

20:16.345 --> 20:18.826
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

20:18.869 --> 20:21.394
You don't believe any of this.

20:25.354 --> 20:29.140
I believe that you believe it.

20:30.403 --> 20:32.666
And that's good enough for me.

20:37.453 --> 20:39.542
I've missed you.

20:45.722 --> 20:48.247
What happened with us?

20:48.290 --> 20:50.858
In your reality?

20:53.469 --> 20:55.297
Uh, you broke up with me.

20:55.341 --> 20:57.299
Nah.
Mm-hmm.

20:57.343 --> 21:00.302
Nah, I don't believe
any version of me would do that.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.000
[laughs]

21:03.044 --> 21:05.699
Did you tell me I was making
the biggest mistake of my life?

21:08.136 --> 21:10.269
I wish I had.

21:12.271 --> 21:14.534
And were you wearing this...

21:16.187 --> 21:18.102
...wonderful beanie

21:18.146 --> 21:19.800
when we first met?

21:19.843 --> 21:21.845
No.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.805
But it was raining.

21:24.848 --> 21:29.679
We ran all the way back to
your... place above the garage.

21:29.723 --> 21:33.379
I live
above a garage? Yeah.

21:33.422 --> 21:35.990
It's nice.
Oh.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.513
So, I'm, I'm...

No. No.

on the block.

37:42.085 --> 37:44.827
[sighs]
I'm gonna solve Lucy's murder

37:44.871 --> 37:47.134
and clear your name, I promise.

37:47.177 --> 37:48.570
The real problem

37:48.614 --> 37:50.572
is gonna be filling my time.

37:50.616 --> 37:52.139
I can't just sit around
the house all day,

37:52.182 --> 37:54.533
working on my defense...
I'll go nuts, so...

37:54.576 --> 37:57.144
I was thinking about
maybe some volunteer work.

37:57.187 --> 37:58.580
The Horseshoe Bay
Historical Society

37:58.624 --> 38:00.103
sees him more than I do.

38:01.844 --> 38:04.325
How about
the Historical Society?

38:04.369 --> 38:06.501
I haven't thought
about that place in years.

38:06.545 --> 38:07.633
You used to love it.

38:07.676 --> 38:08.677
Yeah?

38:08.721 --> 38:09.939
Oh, yeah.

38:09.983 --> 38:12.812
Yeah, I had to do
some research there

38:12.855 --> 38:14.814
for a couple probate cases,

38:14.857 --> 38:17.860
and you came with me
every Saturday.

38:19.166 --> 38:21.647
You'd hide away in the library

38:21.690 --> 38:24.432
and play with the nice woman
who ran the place.

38:24.476 --> 38:26.478
[chuckles]

38:28.349 --> 38:32.179
NANCY:
An anchor, a square
and six horseshoes.

38:35.487 --> 38:38.185
That's it.

38:56.682 --> 38:58.597
[knocking]

39:00.642 --> 39:02.209
Can I help you, dear?
Hi.

39:02.252 --> 39:04.603
I'm Nancy Drew. I used to...

39:04.646 --> 39:06.387
I used to come here
when I was a little kid

39:06.431 --> 39:07.432
with my dad.

39:07.475 --> 39:09.477
Nancy. [chuckles]

39:09.521 --> 39:11.653
You've grown up.

39:11.697 --> 39:13.394
You probably don't remember me.

39:13.438 --> 39:14.569
I'm Hannah Gruen.

39:17.006 --> 39:19.182
[gasps]
Oh, my hands.

39:19.226 --> 39:20.314
I'm sorry, I usually
warn people...

39:20.358 --> 39:22.403
No, no, no, no, no, no, um...

39:22.447 --> 39:24.623
I-I'm so sorry...
that... it's not...

39:24.666 --> 39:26.276
It's not that.

39:26.320 --> 39:27.887
Would you believe me
if I told you that

39:27.930 --> 39:29.454
I've had this whole
experience before?

39:29.497 --> 39:32.282
Call it a...
a dream.

39:32.326 --> 39:33.588
But you were there.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.068
Because the last thing

39:35.111 --> 39:37.766
that I saw before
it all started was this.

39:37.810 --> 39:39.986
Do you, do you recognize this?

39:40.029 --> 39:43.685
Parts of this symbol are hidden
in the Historical Society crest.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.861
Still a smart girl, I see.

39:45.905 --> 39:48.429
This is a key to one
of our lockboxes.

39:50.083 --> 39:52.433
Patrice Dodd's?

39:52.477 --> 39:54.479
No.

39:56.176 --> 39:58.134
Tiffany Hudson's.

40:11.974 --> 40:13.715
Tiffany came to me for help

40:13.759 --> 40:15.108
before she died.

40:15.151 --> 40:17.023
She asked me to hold onto this.

40:17.066 --> 40:19.939
She hoped someone would
come for it someday.

40:21.331 --> 40:24.247
All those lockboxes...
are those...

40:24.291 --> 40:27.250
are those all people that
have come to you for help?

40:27.294 --> 40:29.514
At various times, yes.

40:30.776 --> 40:32.691
What are you?

40:32.734 --> 40:35.694
A keeper, of sorts.

40:35.737 --> 40:37.478
I should warn you.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.785
This isn't easy to watch.

40:43.919 --> 40:48.402
TIFFANY:
I can feel something
watching me in the night.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.709
I went to a local medium.

40:50.752 --> 40:52.667
She gave me this.

40:52.711 --> 40:54.103
But...

40:54.147 --> 40:58.847
it-it's not enough to stop her.

40:58.891 --> 41:01.371
[gasping]

41:07.769 --> 41:08.988
She's here.

41:09.031 --> 41:10.424
HANNAH:
Is there a reason why

41:10.468 --> 41:13.471
this presence
may be haunting you?

41:13.514 --> 41:16.996
TIFFANY:
She's haunting me
because of what I found.

41:18.084 --> 41:20.042
[screams]

41:24.656 --> 41:26.614
What did Tiffany find?

41:26.658 --> 41:29.095
She wouldn't tell me.

41:29.138 --> 41:31.663
She suspected someone
was coming after her

41:31.706 --> 41:33.578
and tracking her whereabouts.

41:33.621 --> 41:36.406
This was the last time
I ever saw her.

41:36.450 --> 41:38.583
Yeah, she was poisoned
three days later.

41:38.626 --> 41:41.629
I tried going to the police,
but by then it was too late.

41:41.673 --> 41:45.067
I believe Tiffany got
too close to the truth.

41:45.111 --> 41:47.243
The truth about what?

41:47.287 --> 41:50.682
Someone didn't want her to solve
Lucy Sable's murder.

42:18.797 --> 42:20.755
[woman screams, bell dings]

42:20.799 --> 42:22.801
[pencil scribbling]
