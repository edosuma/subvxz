The answer, Money Mutual.

07:55.224 --> 07:57.393
I was looking to borrow $500.

07:57.477 --> 08:00.897
<i>So I filled out the online forms</i>

08:00.980 --> 08:04.400

<i>a short-term loan.</i>

08:04.484 --> 08:08.863
<i>When I took the $500,</i>
<i>I was expecting to pay back $650.</i>

08:08.946 --> 08:12.408
<i>I knew $150 was a little</i>
<i>on the high scale,</i>

08:12.492 --> 08:14.827
but I wasn't too worried
about paying it back.

08:15.453 --> 08:19.916
<i>It was a relief to get the money.</i>
<i>I knew I could get everything paid.</i>

08:19.999 --> 08:22.668
<i>The kids, you know, </i>
<i>they'd still have heat.</i>

08:22.752 --> 08:25.963
<i>I knew that they wouldn't be</i>
<i>cold during the winter. </i>

08:26.923 --> 08:30.718
Every payday, they started taking out
their payments of $75,

08:30.801 --> 08:33.554
and I never argued
'cause I was expecting it.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.017
<i>The alarm bells started going off </i>

08:38.100 --> 08:41.145
<i>when I received a notice from the bank</i>
<i>that I was overdrawn.</i>

08:41.229 --> 08:44.899
<i>And when I started investigating,</i>
<i>I discovered that OneClickCash </i>

08:44.982 --> 08:50.571
had tried to take $950 out of my account
without my authorization.

08:52.740 --> 08:57.203
<i>I told them they had already received </i>
<i>several payments of $75, </i>

08:57.286 --> 08:59.580
<i>and it was then they started telling me, </i>

08:59.664 --> 09:02.250
<i>"No, those weren't payments </i>
<i>towards repaying the loan.</i>

09:02.333 --> 09:04.001
<i>Those were loan renewal fees,"</i>

09:04.085 --> 09:08.172
<i>which was something that I knew </i>
<i>nothing about until that phone call. </i>

09:08.256 --> 09:11.092
Apparently, if I don't get
the loan paid in full,

09:11.175 --> 09:14.720
they charge me $75 to roll the loan over
and renew it.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.975
<i>Those loan fees they were</i>
<i>taking out of my account,</i>

09:19.058 --> 09:21.143

A lot of reasons, Joe.

09:52.925 --> 09:55.886
Why don't you go to banks
or legal loan companies?

09:55.970 --> 10:00.725
They want collateral, credit references.
We're bum risk for legit outfits.

10:00.808 --> 10:04.186
Borrowing and lending money
has been around for a long time,

10:04.270 --> 10:07.356

a dicey endeavor, hasn't it?

10:08.941 --> 10:14.905
[Chessin] <i>Banks got out of the business</i>

10:14.989 --> 10:17.074
<i>Consumers needed small loans</i>

10:17.158 --> 10:20.578

<i>provided you have the right license.</i>

10:36.302 --> 10:38.054
But there were some states

15:09.700 --> 15:12.828
after Scott's second
straight SCCA championship.

15:12.912 --> 15:18.208
I am so happy.
I am the happiest mother in the whole...

15:18.292 --> 15:20.085
probably, United States right now.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.545
Have you enjoyed having your friends here?

15:21.629 --> 15:23.130
'Cause you got
a lot of support this weekend.

15:23.213 --> 15:25.382
Great. Yeah.
It's like a home track for us.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.301
Yeah, it's great. Right, Jia?

15:27.384 --> 15:29.345
-And this young lady here.
-Yeah?

15:29.428 --> 15:30.262
Um...

15:30.346 --> 15:32.389
-Have you had a good day watching Daddy?
-Yes.

15:32.473 --> 15:33.724
-You're impressed?
-Look at the camera.

15:33.807 --> 15:34.642
Yeah.

15:38.020 --> 15:40.314
[all cheering]

15:40.397 --> 15:43.859
[Heath] <i>It at some point dawned on me</i>
<i>there was this guy out there,</i>

15:43.943 --> 15:45.986
<i>who was doing everything </i>
<i>he could possibly do </i>

15:46.070 --> 15:48.656
<i>to become a sports celebrity.</i>

15:48.739 --> 15:53.118
But he had this secret world where he had
this business that nobody knew about.

15:53.202 --> 15:56.246
Nobody knew he was
associated with it. It was hidden...

15:56.330 --> 15:59.500
A shell company within a shell company
within a tribe

15:59.583 --> 16:04.797
and he had somehow managed for years
and years and years to get by undetected.

16:10.552 --> 16:13.514
<i>There was a woman in Colorado,</i>
<i>who, in late 2004,</i>

16:13.597 --> 16:17.184
had taken out over $500 in loans
from two payday lenders,

16:17.267 --> 16:18.769
and she figured out

16:18.852 --> 16:22.564
that they weren't really registered
to make loans in Colorado.

16:22.648 --> 16:24.817
<i>So she complained to the Attorney General.</i>

16:24.900 --> 16:29.655
<i>And the Attorney General sent a really</i>
<i>routine letter to the address on the loan,</i>

16:29.738 --> 16:34.660
<i>and the address was this strip mall </i>
<i>in Carson City, Nevada.</i>

16:35.619 --> 16:39.623
I enlisted the help
of the Nevada Attorney General

16:39.707 --> 16:42.167
and said, "What are these PO boxes?"

16:42.251 --> 16:46.547
<i>And so we found out that </i>
<i>the president officer of both companies </i>

16:46.630 --> 16:49.425
<i>was an individual </i>
<i>by the name of James Fontano.</i>

16:50.759 --> 16:52.928
At the height of our business

16:54.054 --> 17:00.019
we were managers, directors or officers
for about 785 companies.

17:00.102 --> 17:04.648
<i>A lot of them we didn't really know </i>
<i>because we were contacted by attorneys </i>

17:04.732 --> 17:07.901
<i>who did not always give us </i>
<i>the exact nature of the business,</i>

17:07.985 --> 17:11.488
just that they needed a certain level
of protection and anonymity,

17:11.572 --> 17:15.075
and so that's what we would provide.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.162
[Chessin] <i>We went back to court</i>
<i>with this information.</i>

17:18.245 --> 17:20.080
<i>We said we wanted contempt citations</i>

17:20.164 --> 17:23.500
<i>and contempt proceedings </i>
<i>brought against Mr. Fontano.</i>

17:25.210 --> 17:29.506
A month later, there's this document
filed from these two Indian tribes.

17:30.591 --> 17:35.471
<i>They say, "Oh, nobody in Carson City </i>
<i>owns these payday lenders. We own them."</i>

17:36.180 --> 17:38.182
[Chessin] <i>One tribe said,</i>
<i>"We are Cash Advance," </i>

17:38.265 --> 17:41.435
<i>and then a different tribe said,</i>
<i>"We are Preferred Cash."</i>

17:41.518 --> 17:44.730
<i>And you can't touch us </i>
<i>because we're Indian tribes. </i>

17:44.813 --> 17:48.400
Prior to then,
we had no indication whatsoever

17:48.484 --> 17:50.527
that Indian tribes were involved.

18:01.663 --> 18:05.834
[Heath] <i>I went to Oklahoma to meet</i>
<i>and talk to this Indian tribe. </i>

18:05.918 --> 18:08.837
To figure out, you know,
"What's going on here?"

18:11.340 --> 18:14.093
<i>It was totally a rural area.</i>

18:15.010 --> 18:17.638
There was, essentially,
weeds and a building.

18:19.556 --> 18:24.228
<i>I walked into the office that was supposed</i>
<i>to be this huge payday lending operation. </i>

18:25.062 --> 18:26.438
<i>It was totally dead.</i>
<i>There was nobody in there. </i>

18:26.522 --> 18:29.316
<i>It was a receptionist and maybe a guy.</i>

18:30.192 --> 18:33.028
<i>They were very friendly to me </i>
<i>and I explained</i>

18:33.112 --> 18:35.447
I was there to talk about
the payday lending business.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.783
They'd have somebody
get back to me. Nobody ever did.

18:39.034 --> 18:41.829
<i>I thought,</i>
<i>"There is something really wrong here,</i>

18:41.912 --> 18:44.540
and I just want to know
who's actually running this business

18:44.623 --> 18:45.916
and why are they lying about it?"

18:50.546 --> 18:53.298
[Peterson] <i>Indian tribes have something </i>
<i>called sovereign immunity,</i>

18:53.382 --> 18:58.011
<i>which is just to say that the state </i>
<i>government can't sue that Indian tribe. </i>

18:58.095 --> 19:00.430
<i>So a state government </i>
<i>doesn't have the right to bring</i>

19:00.514 --> 19:03.350
an Indian tribal government into court.

19:03.433 --> 19:06.145
The federal government can,
but state governments can't.

19:08.021 --> 19:11.733
<i>The loans were still illegal.</i>
<i>It's just that, for a technical reason, </i>

19:11.817 --> 19:13.277
<i>the sovereign immunity doctrine</i>

19:13.360 --> 19:17.072
<i>doesn't allow state governments </i>
<i>to actually enforce their law.</i>

19:17.156 --> 19:18.824
[Heath] <i>Somebody had come up with a way</i>

19:18.907 --> 19:23.203
of having a payday lending business
that wasn't subject to state law.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.594
[Scott] <i>I didn't have anybody</i>
<i>to fall back on.</i>

19:40.679 --> 19:45.392
No rich parents,
no big company, no safety net.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.147
So I just had to rely on myself,
make my own breaks.

19:54.943 --> 20:00.240
So no matter what, at the end of the day,
it's up to you.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.325
Nobody else.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.997
<i>There was no newsletter </i>
<i>that came out and said, </i>

20:07.080 --> 20:09.750
<i>"Hey, this is a great business." </i>
<i>Nothing like that.</i>

20:09.833 --> 20:13.045
We saw an opportunity
and my brother Blaine and I

20:14.129 --> 20:15.380
<i>decided we'd give it a try.</i>

20:17.299 --> 20:19.718
<i>This is where we started it.</i>

20:19.801 --> 20:23.180
A small office, down in the basement,
in a flood zone.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.269
<i>When you come and see this</i>
<i>and then look at the space</i>

20:29.353 --> 20:31.396
<i>where we were almost 20 years later,</i>

20:31.480 --> 20:34.191
<i>with 1,600 employees, </i>
<i>it kinda tells a story.</i>

20:36.068 --> 20:39.488
<i>There was a lot of risk </i>
<i>because a lot of it was unknown.</i>

20:39.571 --> 20:40.989
<i>No road maps.</i>

20:41.698 --> 20:43.742
<i>We had a trade name, called Mister Money.</i>

20:43.825 --> 20:46.286
<i>And we liked to use the word "fast cash," </i>

20:46.370 --> 20:49.331
<i>because it described what the product was </i>
<i>and people understood it.</i>

20:50.499 --> 20:54.086
[Muir] <i>These type of loans </i>
<i>were advertised by Yellow Pages</i>

20:54.169 --> 20:57.547
<i>or classified ads or radio spots.</i>

20:57.631 --> 20:58.882
Scott took it online.

21:01.551 --> 21:02.970
[Scott] <i>It didn't really take off </i>
<i>in the beginning.</i>

21:03.053 --> 21:06.890
<i>It was stable, but we weren't </i>
<i>setting any records, by any means. </i>

21:06.974 --> 21:08.850
<i>One of the paradigm shifts in the business</i>

21:08.934 --> 21:11.728
was being able to adapt it
to the Internet.

21:12.688 --> 21:16.692
<i>I was more involved in</i>
<i>the technology and marketing side of it. </i>

21:17.818 --> 21:23.448
<i>Blaine, he did more of the human resource,</i>
<i>management, employee things like that. </i>

21:23.532 --> 21:28.996
<i>He played a pivotal role in the growth</i>
<i>and, you know, I was lucky to have him.</i>

21:29.621 --> 21:33.709
[Muir] <i>When it was operating at its peak,</i>
<i>there was over 1,200 employees. </i>

21:33.792 --> 21:37.629
<i>Even with 1,200 people, it was a family.</i>
<i>And that's really what Blaine did.</i>

21:37.713 --> 21:40.132
<i>Blaine knew all 1,200 </i>
<i>and they all knew him.</i>

21:41.174 --> 21:44.803
At its zenith, it would have hit
a billion dollars in annual revenue.

21:49.308 --> 21:54.563
[Anita Finney] <i>It was the most loving,</i>
<i>energetic family that just grew.</i>

21:54.646 --> 21:57.441
<i>It was exciting to hear </i>
<i>people on the phone...</i>

21:57.524 --> 22:02.571
<i>You walk up and down the aisles</i>
<i>and hear people happy to do their job.</i>

22:02.654 --> 22:05.240
<i>Caring for each other.</i>

22:05.324 --> 22:12.164
It was the best place
that I have ever been in my life.

22:14.958 --> 22:16.918
[Scott] <i>I mean, I loved what we did. </i>

22:17.002 --> 22:21.131
Most people will say that's bullshit,
but we did a good job at it.

22:22.382 --> 22:26.344
If you would call one of the millions
of customers and say,

22:27.179 --> 22:30.140
"Why did you come back
and use this product and service?"

22:30.223 --> 22:32.350
And they said,
"Because it was fast, simple and easy,

22:32.434 --> 22:34.936
and the company did exactly
what they said they would."

22:35.020 --> 22:36.772
It doesn't get much better.

22:41.276 --> 22:44.321
<i>You know, the old saying.</i>

22:44.404 --> 22:47.074
Well, it's not,
"Careful what you wish for." That's one.

22:47.157 --> 22:49.826
"No good deed goes unpunished."

22:57.292 --> 22:59.252
[indistinct chatter]

23:08.553 --> 23:10.222
[Archer] <i>OneClickCash kept calling me. </i>

23:10.305 --> 23:13.475
<i>Their attitude was, "You owe us money,</i>

23:13.558 --> 23:17.479
and we're going to do anything and
everything we have to do to make you pay."

23:45.257 --> 23:48.802
<i>It was infuriating.</i>
<i>I was trying to reason with them.</i>

23:48.885 --> 23:51.096
<i>I wasn't trying to get out</i>
<i>of paying the loan.</i>

23:51.179 --> 23:53.473
<i>I borrowed the money,</i>
<i>I rightfully owe it back.</i>

23:53.557 --> 23:58.645
But, at the same time,
I was not willing to be taken advantage of

23:58.728 --> 24:05.652
and borrow $500 and end up paying
$1,000, $2,000, $3,000 back.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.028
I wasn't going to do it.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.655
Because why?

24:08.738 --> 24:12.742
<i>When I told them not to call back,</i>
<i>federal communication rules state </i>

24:12.826 --> 24:15.453
<i>if I tell you to stop calling me, </i>
<i>you have to stop.</i>

24:15.537 --> 24:17.622
It was at that point they said,

24:17.706 --> 24:21.001
"We're with the Indian tribe.
We can do what we want."

24:24.546 --> 24:27.215
<i>I don't care </i>
<i>if you're an Indian tribe or not. </i>

24:27.299 --> 24:32.053
<i>I don't care if you're Mexican, American, </i>
<i>Chinese, Japanese, Spanish. </i>

24:32.137 --> 24:33.471
Martian.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.308
<i>You need to abide by the laws </i>

24:36.391 --> 24:39.644
<i>regardless as to whether you are a nation </i>
<i>within a nation, </i>

24:39.728 --> 24:43.440
you're still in the United States
and you should follow United States law.

24:48.278 --> 24:49.362
[Chief Bill Follis] <i>I'll tell you a story.</i>

24:49.446 --> 24:53.158
<i>I was sitting at home one night,</i>
<i>phone rang and it's this lady.</i>

24:53.241 --> 24:56.119
My dad borrowed $300
or something like that...

24:56.203 --> 24:57.245
Blah, blah, blah.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.956
And he's getting charged
this interest rate.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.126
And I says, "Just a minute."

25:03.210 --> 25:06.755
I says, "How did you get my name?"

25:06.838 --> 25:10.467
She said, "I called the police department
and asked who is chief of the Modocs."

25:10.550 --> 25:12.719
[chuckling] And got my number.

25:13.720 --> 25:16.932
I didn't like it very well
and I told Scott about it.

25:21.311 --> 25:25.523
<i>We were shipped here</i>
<i>in the 1800s as prisoners of war.</i>

25:25.607 --> 25:28.693
In fact, 1873,
if you wanna get the dates right.

25:29.736 --> 25:33.657
<i>Oklahoma was a deposit area</i>
<i>for the tribes. </i>

25:33.740 --> 25:35.283
<i>From the east to the west.</i>

25:35.367 --> 25:37.077
I'm the only Northwest tribe.

25:38.745 --> 25:40.956
<i>Not only did they take our land,</i>

25:41.039 --> 25:44.668
<i>but our resources </i>
<i>and all for big business.</i>

25:46.920 --> 25:50.006
<i>We lost our language. </i>
<i>We lost our culture.</i>

25:50.090 --> 25:53.802
The accountability
has never been established

25:53.885 --> 25:56.263
in the United States government
as far as I'm concerned.

26:00.016 --> 26:04.229
The representative from Kansas
that I knew contacted me, said,

26:04.312 --> 26:10.110
"I have a person that wants to talk to you
about the loan business."

26:10.777 --> 26:14.990
<i>And I didn't know Scott,</i>
<i>but he vouched for Scott. </i>

26:15.073 --> 26:17.033
So that's good enough for me.

26:19.494 --> 26:23.415
<i>It was his idea and he conveyed it to us</i>
<i>and we accepted.</i>

26:23.498 --> 26:24.958
<i>It's just that simple.</i>

26:26.084 --> 26:32.340
<i>Idea was we use our sovereignty,</i>
<i>we set it up, we get so much money</i>

26:32.424 --> 26:34.426
and that satisfied me.

26:35.510 --> 26:39.472
<i>It was a business deal and it was </i>
<i>a very successful business deal. </i>

26:39.556 --> 26:43.435
I guess my confidence
in Scott Tucker made it work.

26:47.188 --> 26:48.940
Hi, how are you?

26:53.236 --> 26:56.698
I can say this,
it was just right up there with gaming.

27:02.120 --> 27:05.040
In profitability, gaming's here,

27:05.123 --> 27:07.500
loan business is here,
instead of down here.

27:10.337 --> 27:11.463
Hi, Sheriff.

27:12.714 --> 27:13.715
Okay.

27:13.798 --> 27:16.092
<i>We've deposited all our money</i>
<i>in the banks here</i>

27:16.176 --> 27:17.886
<i>and then it goes in funds.</i>

27:17.969 --> 27:21.181
<i>We buy land, we help people</i>
<i>with their home improvements.</i>

27:24.142 --> 27:27.937
<i>Our money goes right back to the people.</i>
<i>It's the people's money. </i>

27:28.021 --> 27:31.066
<i>It's not my money, </i>
<i>it's the tribal people's money. </i>

27:34.277 --> 27:36.237
<i>We loan to people. </i>

27:36.321 --> 27:40.241
<i>Sure, it's high interest rate. </i>
<i>A lot of people doesn't like that. </i>

27:40.325 --> 27:44.162
<i>But these are people </i>
<i>that could not get money anywhere else. </i>

27:44.245 --> 27:46.331
<i>Like I say, we operated legally. </i>

27:46.414 --> 27:51.753
We have not done anything illegal,
but we've been accused of it.

29:16.296 --> 29:19.424
[Gorecki] <i>Scott Tucker ran AMG Services, </i>
<i>undoubtedly. </i>

29:19.507 --> 29:24.012
He was the one who brought the business
to the tribes in proposals.

29:24.095 --> 29:25.722
He was the one who built up the company.

29:26.556 --> 29:29.225
<i>AMG's loan portfolios represented </i>

29:29.309 --> 29:32.812
<i>the highest volume payday lending </i>
<i>operation in the United States.</i>

29:32.896 --> 29:36.900
<i>They used loan documents and disclosures</i>
<i>that didn't seem to reflect</i>

29:36.983 --> 29:40.111
<i>what they were actually asking </i>
<i>consumers to pay back.</i>

29:40.195 --> 29:42.739
So after the tribal jurisdiction issue
was resolved,

29:42.822 --> 29:44.365
the next step was showing that

29:44.449 --> 29:46.409
the loan documents
were actually deceptive.

29:48.328 --> 29:52.582
<i>A lot of the consumer victims</i>
<i>we talked to were struggling individuals.</i>

29:52.665 --> 29:55.001
<i>They were living, usually,</i>
<i>paycheck to paycheck.</i>

29:55.084 --> 29:56.419
And a lot of times, in between paychecks

29:56.503 --> 30:00.215
they would find themselves short
maybe $200, $300.

30:00.298 --> 30:03.051
And so, many of them would go online
and they'd do a search.

30:03.134 --> 30:04.844
They'd search for a payday loan.

30:06.721 --> 30:08.348
<i>They would fill out the loan application.</i>

30:09.599 --> 30:13.269
<i>At the end, </i>
<i>they were asked to check four boxes</i>

30:13.353 --> 30:16.523
indicating they understood
all of the loan terms.

30:16.606 --> 30:20.527
<i>Each of those four boxes corresponded</i>
<i>to various hyperlinked documents</i>

30:20.610 --> 30:21.945
<i>they were supposed to have read.</i>

30:22.028 --> 30:26.366
The loan document that sets out
the terms of the loan has a box.

30:26.449 --> 30:27.909
We call it the TILA box.

30:28.868 --> 30:31.412
<i>It laid out</i>
<i>how much money you were taking out.</i>

30:31.496 --> 30:35.834
<i>So, let's take $300, for example,</i>
<i>which was the most common loan. </i>

30:35.917 --> 30:38.002
<i>That would be the amount you're borrowing.</i>

30:38.086 --> 30:42.632
<i>It would lay out a finance charge.</i>
<i>For $300, usually $90.</i>

30:42.715 --> 30:46.678
<i>And it would tell you </i>
<i>the total of payments, $390. </i>

30:46.761 --> 30:48.054
<i>Then you'd accept the loan.</i>

30:48.137 --> 30:50.014
<i>The reality was very different, though.</i>

30:51.933 --> 30:53.768
<i>After two weeks, on the payday,</i>

30:53.852 --> 30:57.105
<i>the consumer would see $90</i>
<i>come out of their account.</i>

30:57.188 --> 30:59.941
<i>And then in another two weeks, </i>
<i>they'd see another $90 come out.</i>

31:00.024 --> 31:02.527
<i>In another two weeks, another $90. </i>

31:02.610 --> 31:05.405
<i>At that point, they've paid off $360.</i>

31:05.488 --> 31:08.616
<i>And they figure, $30 more to $390.</i>

31:09.158 --> 31:12.954
<i>On the next pay period,</i>
<i>they'd see $140 come out.</i>

31:13.037 --> 31:15.874
<i>At which point, </i>
<i>the consumer becomes tipped off </i>

31:15.957 --> 31:19.043
<i>that something's wrong, not right.</i>
<i>And they call in.</i>

31:19.127 --> 31:22.088
And during that call,
they would be told that

31:22.171 --> 31:26.426
because they didn't act
to pay the loan off

31:26.509 --> 31:28.595
in full on their first pay period,

31:28.678 --> 31:31.180
something that they had to proactively do,

31:31.264 --> 31:35.810
the loan simply got renewed every
two weeks, every two weeks, over and over,

31:35.894 --> 31:39.230
and none of the $360
that they had already paid

31:39.314 --> 31:41.649
was applied to their principal at all.

31:42.400 --> 31:45.737
<i>If this process were to continue </i>
<i>to its resolution,</i>

31:45.820 --> 31:47.697
<i>the way it was structured to do,</i>

31:47.780 --> 31:52.827
<i>$300 would end up costing consumers </i>
<i>$975 in total.</i>

33:04.899 --> 33:07.360
You can hear the dismay in their voice

33:07.443 --> 33:10.029
when they realize
they've paid all this money

33:10.113 --> 33:14.993
and all of it has been in finance charges.
The principal is still there, untouched.

33:17.745 --> 33:20.581
[Nikhil Singhvi] <i>The money bag document</i>
<i>was one of several smoking guns </i>

33:20.665 --> 33:25.211
showing the employees knew
consumers were confused.

33:25.294 --> 33:26.671
That they were ripping consumers off.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.549
[Gorecki] <i>What it showed was </i>

33:29.632 --> 33:32.927
<i>AMG employees and managers</i>
<i>knew how the loan worked.</i>

33:33.011 --> 33:35.555
<i>They just weren't willing </i>
<i>to tell consumers that. </i>

33:37.557 --> 33:40.852
<i>We asked some consumers </i>
<i>to send us their loan documents,</i>

33:40.935 --> 33:42.603
<i>to see what they said.</i>

33:43.688 --> 33:45.606
<i>And it became very clear to us, </i>

33:45.690 --> 33:48.484
<i>just from a very brief reading </i>
<i>of the document,</i>

33:48.568 --> 33:53.197
<i>that a reasonable consumer would have </i>
<i>absolutely no idea how this loan worked.</i>

33:53.281 --> 33:54.615
<i>The language is confusing.</i>

33:54.699 --> 33:57.243
<i>It's full of sentences </i>
<i>that are interrupted </i>

33:57.326 --> 34:02.331
<i>by other information that's unrelated </i>
<i>and not relevant to the loan terms.</i>

34:02.415 --> 34:06.085
<i>In court, AMG challenged </i>
<i>our determination this was deceptive.</i>

34:06.169 --> 34:08.755
And, actually, in one of their filings,

34:08.838 --> 34:14.093
their attorneys pulled out
specific sentences from the fine print...

34:15.470 --> 34:19.390
<i>and sort of set 'em up one after another, </i>
<i>and then told the judge,</i>

34:19.474 --> 34:23.227
<i>"Look, judge, it's very clear.</i>
<i>The loan was clearly explained.</i>

34:23.311 --> 34:26.773
<i>Here are all the ways that we disclosed </i>
<i>to consumers how it worked."</i>

34:29.609 --> 34:32.862
<i>A reasonable consumer </i>
<i>wouldn't understand this language</i>

34:32.945 --> 34:34.822
and a reasonable consumer
shouldn't need an attorney

34:34.906 --> 34:36.908
standing there right next to them,

34:36.991 --> 34:40.244
pointing the different places
and the order of the sentences

34:40.328 --> 34:42.205
to help them understand
how the loan works.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.042
[Scott] <i>We didn't think the loan note </i>
<i>was confusing. </i>

34:46.125 --> 34:47.835
<i>It was a standard industry practice.</i>

34:47.919 --> 34:51.589
<i>It'd been in the business </i>
<i>for, you know, probably ten years.</i>

34:52.298 --> 34:55.176
Customers knew the process, the renewal.

34:55.259 --> 34:58.429
If they didn't pay off,
they would incur more finance charges.

34:59.013 --> 35:01.057
The FTC loved to talk about fine print

35:01.682 --> 35:05.436
and conveniently ignore
all of the other communications

35:05.520 --> 35:08.606
that the lenders took
to inform the consumers,

35:08.689 --> 35:11.275
"Here's what's gonna happen,"
and the consumers knew it.

35:12.068 --> 35:14.654
<i>There were multiple e-mails, </i>

35:14.737 --> 35:17.782
<i>confirmation e-mails, </i>
<i>payment reminder e-mails,</i>

35:17.865 --> 35:22.370
<i>explanation e-mails, </i>
<i>that went to the consumers that explained,</i>

35:22.453 --> 35:26.332
<i>"If you did nothing, </i>
<i>if you did not take any action, </i>

35:26.415 --> 35:28.459
<i>this loan would be renewed,</i>

35:28.543 --> 35:31.337
<i>and you would not make </i>
<i>any payment towards principal.</i>

35:31.420 --> 35:34.423
It would only pay your finance charge,
and we would renew it."

35:34.507 --> 35:39.637
And that model has been used
in the industry for...

35:40.638 --> 35:43.808
[stutters] as long as I can remember.

35:43.891 --> 35:46.686
What he's saying is that model,

35:46.769 --> 35:52.150
that was an industry standard model
used by over a hundred different lenders.

35:56.737 --> 35:59.907
Sure, no, I can give you some examples
on how that would work.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.911
When I started working there,
things started to take off for them.

36:03.995 --> 36:05.746
It turned into a big machine.

36:07.540 --> 36:13.004
<i>It went from a tight-knit family thing </i>
<i>to a full-on corporate atmosphere.</i>

36:13.087 --> 36:14.547
We do that four times, starting...

36:14.630 --> 36:16.966
[former employee]<i> Scott and Blaine kept </i>
<i>to themselves. </i>

36:17.049 --> 36:20.428
Eagles fly with eagles,

36:20.511 --> 36:27.351
so all the top brass,
they would be amongst themselves.

36:30.271 --> 36:35.693
I was always told that everything that
we were doing was legal. [chuckles]

36:35.776 --> 36:39.864
People need payday loans to get by,
so maybe I justified it that way.

36:41.282 --> 36:44.410
<i>It was toxic, at times.</i>

36:47.246 --> 36:48.080
[Ivan Valdivia] <i>All they said was... </i>

36:48.164 --> 36:51.876
"Our company's owned
by an Indian tribe in Oklahoma.

36:51.959 --> 36:57.548
And if anybody calls and asks you
where you are, where you're located,

36:57.632 --> 37:00.009
you're located here in Miami, Oklahoma."

37:00.092 --> 37:01.510
That was in training in day one.

37:02.470 --> 37:04.180
<i>You couldn't use your cell phone </i>
<i>in the building.</i>

37:04.263 --> 37:06.766
<i>You'd have to use your cell phone</i>
<i>in the parking lot.</i>

37:06.849 --> 37:08.059
<i>Now, looking back, </i>

37:08.142 --> 37:12.146
they didn't want to have pictures
of their facility taken at all,

37:12.230 --> 37:14.273
'cause we weren't supposed to be
in Kansas.

37:15.942 --> 37:18.194
<i>I didn't think </i>
<i>we were doing anything wrong.</i>

37:18.277 --> 37:21.405
I didn't think they were trying
to hide anything, but obviously they were.

37:55.314 --> 37:57.817
AMG Services tried very hard
to make it look

37:57.900 --> 38:00.027
like they were a tribally run business.

38:01.028 --> 38:03.698
<i>Really, nothing was happening </i>
<i>on tribal land.</i>

38:03.781 --> 38:06.200
<i>It was all done in Overland Park, Kansas.</i>

38:07.243 --> 38:09.370
<i>The three tribes</i>
<i>that they were working with </i>

38:09.453 --> 38:11.706
<i>were in Oklahoma and Nebraska. </i>

38:11.789 --> 38:14.750
And so when consumers called in
to talk about their loans,

38:15.334 --> 38:19.839
<i>representatives were told to pretend</i>
<i>that they were in Oklahoma or Nebraska.</i>

38:19.922 --> 38:21.924
<i>As a way of making small talk </i>
<i>with consumers,</i>

38:22.008 --> 38:26.345
<i>the managers would e-mail around </i>
<i>a daily weather report for the two states </i>

38:26.429 --> 38:27.513
<i>because they said, </i>

38:27.596 --> 38:30.099
"Let's make sure you have
the right weather to talk about."

38:34.478 --> 38:39.692
I mean, that was an operational decision
made by a manager.

38:39.775 --> 38:42.945
And there was only one of them
that did that.

38:43.029 --> 38:49.035
And we're not really familiar with
how many people they said that to,

38:49.118 --> 38:50.911
what the protocol on that was,

38:50.995 --> 38:53.914
but it was something
that we weren't aware of.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.292
They weren't my employees.

38:56.375 --> 38:59.587
The employees that work for me
work on the software program

38:59.670 --> 39:02.089
and the platform.

39:02.173 --> 39:08.012
But they were all employed,
for the most part,

39:08.095 --> 39:12.308
by one or more of the tribes.

39:12.391 --> 39:14.310
They worked for the tribes themselves.

39:14.393 --> 39:18.731
It was their business,
their power and their control.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.613
[Singhvi]<i> We had </i>
<i>so much other evidence that </i>

39:25.696 --> 39:28.199
this appearance of a tribal operation
was a façade.

39:41.837 --> 39:44.298
[Gorecki] <i>Carolyn Williams</i>
<i>used to be an employee </i>

39:44.382 --> 39:46.467
<i>of one of the tribes, the Miami tribe.</i>

39:46.550 --> 39:51.972
<i>She worked for Don Brady, who, on paper,</i>
<i>was listed as CEO of AMG Services.</i>

39:52.056 --> 39:55.309
In reality,
he really didn't do much at all.

39:56.018 --> 39:58.479
<i>Carolyn became increasingly uncomfortable </i>

39:58.562 --> 40:00.564
<i>with the types of things </i>
<i>they were talking about</i>

40:00.648 --> 40:05.361
and so she began to make a few recordings
of her conversations with Don Brady.

40:34.807 --> 40:38.060
[Gorecki] <i>Her recordings and testimony </i>
<i>were key in showing </i>

40:38.144 --> 40:41.397
<i>that, really, Scott Tucker </i>
<i>was the one who was in charge.</i>

40:41.480 --> 40:45.151
He was the one running the show.
Really, he was the key person,

40:45.234 --> 40:48.320
the key actor
in this entire business operation.

40:48.904 --> 40:52.283
[Singhvi] <i>Employees were quizzed </i>
<i>on the top management of the company, </i>

40:52.366 --> 40:55.453
<i>and the correct answers </i>
<i>were Scott Tucker and Blaine Tucker.</i>

40:55.536 --> 40:58.789
<i>Norma Tucker, their mother, </i>
<i>shows up on the payroll.</i>

40:58.873 --> 41:03.169
<i>Kim Tucker was also on the payroll,</i>
<i>but her involvement in our case </i>

41:03.252 --> 41:06.589
<i>was basically as the beneficiary </i>
<i>of $19 million in cash</i>

41:06.672 --> 41:10.259
<i>that Scott Tucker basically bundled </i>
<i>from the tribal accounts </i>

41:10.342 --> 41:12.761
<i>and sent over to her.</i>

41:12.845 --> 41:15.139
[Gorecki] <i>In fact,</i>
<i>the tribes were deriving </i>

41:15.222 --> 41:18.767
only 1% of gross collected revenue
from these companies.

41:18.851 --> 41:22.563
99% of those revenues were going
to Scott Tucker and his companies.

41:22.646 --> 41:25.816
The tribal accounts
were practically his piggy bank.

41:33.824 --> 41:36.118
[Zabinski] <i>I got a call from </i>
<i>one of Scott's assistants, who said, </i>

41:36.202 --> 41:38.787
<i>"Hey, my boss wants to go race cars.</i>

41:38.871 --> 41:40.831
He's ordered a car
and he's looking for a coach."

41:43.542 --> 41:46.045
And I said, "How much experience
does your boss have?"

41:46.128 --> 41:48.714
They said, "He doesn't have
any experience."

41:50.549 --> 41:53.969
<i>You look at it on the surface, </i>
<i>you've never driven a race car,</i>

41:54.053 --> 41:57.473
<i>you're gonna go buy a $300,000 car </i>
<i>with 500 horsepower</i>

41:58.265 --> 42:00.309
<i>and go figure it out.</i>

42:00.392 --> 42:01.560
And he wasn't a natural.

42:03.812 --> 42:05.397
<i>I love Scott, but he's not burdened </i>

42:05.481 --> 42:09.276
<i>with a great deal of natural ability </i>
<i>when it comes to driving race cars.</i>

42:09.360 --> 42:13.405
<i>He had to work harder, </i>
<i>I think, than anybody else.</i>

42:14.365 --> 42:18.452
And now he's a fantastic driver.
Really, really a top driver.

<i>Most guys that are determined </i>
<i>to race the Ferrari Challenge </i>

<i>that it's not a big deal for them</i>

<i>to afford to go racing,</i>
<i>'cause it's an expensive endeavor,</i>

42:28.546 --> 42:29.880
<i>as you might imagine.</i>

42:32.383 --> 42:35.386
<i>I honestly don't know </i>
<i>how many full-time employees there were.</i>

42:35.469 --> 42:37.721

42:57.783 --> 43:01.453
<i>As we started to move up in the sport, </i>
<i>and get to where we were racing</i>

43:01.537 --> 43:05.958
on television and more in the public eye,
it was a vulnerability for him.

43:08.544 --> 43:11.255
For endurance racing,
he was in fact a celebrity.

43:11.880 --> 43:14.091
<i>He was very conscious of his image.</i>

43:15.509 --> 43:18.554
<i>He had a reporter who followed him around</i>

43:18.637 --> 43:21.390
and asked him questions
and posted the videos on YouTube.

43:21.473 --> 43:23.809
Is it difficult to adjust
when that happens?

43:23.892 --> 43:28.147
You gotta get a couple laps in you to...
Yeah, you get acclimated to it.

43:28.230 --> 43:30.816

43:30.899 --> 43:32.568

43:33.277 --> 43:35.237
<i>He had a documentary made,</i>

43:35.321 --> 43:40.034

[Zabinski] <i>He is only guilty</i>

43:51.170 --> 43:55.424
Actually, you know what?
He's also guilty of being clever.

43:55.507 --> 43:57.301
And clever pisses people off.

<i>which is "race the rulebook."</i>

44:06.518 --> 44:08.270
<i>If I'm racing in a series,</i>

44:08.354 --> 44:12.816

for guys with Native American drivers,

44:17.363 --> 44:20.449
I'm gonna start hiring
Native American drivers, man.

44:20.532 --> 44:23.577

It's easier. It'll be simpler.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.245
[tires screeching]

44:27.206 --> 44:29.833
I don't think he was trying to
hide anything from the government.

<i>was an incredibly profitable business </i>
<i>for Scott Tucker.</i>

45:12.668 --> 45:16.922
<i>He made at least $400 million </i>
<i>from this business.</i>

45:18.590 --> 45:22.010
A lot of which was routed
to his racing business,

45:22.094 --> 45:24.054
to his shell corporations,

45:24.138 --> 45:27.891
<i>to buying expensive vehicles </i>
<i>like Ferraris and Porsches,</i>

45:27.975 --> 45:32.146
to the $8 million Aspen house
that he bought for himself and his wife.

45:32.229 --> 45:33.355
<i>He also had a private jet, </i>

45:33.439 --> 45:38.152
<i>so lots of money on jet travel, </i>
<i>vacations, you name it.</i>

45:39.445 --> 45:42.322
All of this was funded
with consumer funds, consumer money.

45:46.535 --> 45:48.537
[Singhvi]<i> This happened to </i>
<i>1.5 million people </i>

45:48.620 --> 45:52.624
<i>and it caused $1.3 billion dollars </i>
<i>in damage.</i>

45:52.708 --> 45:54.543
<i>Those are astronomical numbers, </i>

45:54.626 --> 45:56.962
but they cause you
to lose perspective sometimes.

45:57.045 --> 46:00.090
That those are
1.5 million individual stories

46:00.174 --> 46:02.843
of people who were living
paycheck to paycheck.

46:02.926 --> 46:03.760
They were struggling.

46:06.054 --> 46:09.892
[Gorecki] <i>It wasn't just about enforcing</i>
<i>the law, which we always want to do,</i>

46:09.975 --> 46:12.686
<i>but it was getting justice </i>
<i>for these consumers </i>

46:12.769 --> 46:14.521
<i>and getting refunds for them.</i>

46:14.605 --> 46:17.441
It's hard to read through
so many complaints

46:17.524 --> 46:19.610
and listen to so many consumer calls,

46:19.693 --> 46:24.323
and not be moved by the misery
and the hardship

46:24.406 --> 46:26.617
these companies imposed on consumers.

46:28.368 --> 46:29.870
[operator] <i>How can I help you today?</i>

46:29.953 --> 46:34.041
[consumer] <i>I owed $500 in October </i>

46:34.124 --> 46:37.419
<i>and my balance is $650, </i>

46:37.503 --> 46:41.840
<i>and they've been taking money </i>
<i>out of my account.</i>

46:43.800 --> 46:46.762
[operators and consumers
speaking indistinctly]

47:07.115 --> 47:10.536
[Gorecki] <i>The court agreed </i>
<i>with our 1.3 billion calculation</i>

47:10.619 --> 47:12.204
<i>and awarded that.</i>

47:13.497 --> 47:15.624
I believe the $1.3 billion

47:15.707 --> 47:19.670
was the largest litigated judgment
that the FTC has ever obtained.

47:27.719 --> 47:30.222
[Peterson] <i>The Federal Trade Commission </i>
<i>won a very large judgment,</i>

47:30.305 --> 47:31.807
<i>over a billion dollars.</i>

47:33.475 --> 47:37.813
<i>That strikes me as an appropriate measure </i>
<i>of the amount of harm</i>

47:37.896 --> 47:41.358
associated with the illegal practices
in these lending transactions.

47:46.321 --> 47:49.658
[Scott] Does it piss me off?
Fuck, yeah, it pisses me off.

47:53.870 --> 47:56.665
Fucking take it.
I don't give a fuck about it.

47:56.748 --> 47:59.084
I could give two... fuck it.
Two... fuck it.

47:59.167 --> 48:00.877
Sure, give it to 'em.

48:00.961 --> 48:02.629
Okay with that.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.965
Hey, we'll do that. Fucking take it.

48:05.048 --> 48:07.426
I don't give a fuck about that thing.

48:22.024 --> 48:25.193
[Heath] <i>It was clear</i>
<i>that the business was crashing down, </i>

48:25.277 --> 48:27.279
<i>and they would have to pay back </i>
<i>all this money.</i>

48:27.362 --> 48:32.784
And then Blaine Tucker
was found in a car in a shopping mall,

48:32.868 --> 48:37.831
I think in Kansas City or Overland Park,
and apparently he'd killed himself.

48:42.711 --> 48:45.005
[Zabinski] <i>Blaine's gone.</i>
<i>He doesn't exist anymore. </i>

48:45.088 --> 48:47.591
I loved Blaine.
I thought he was a terrific guy.

48:47.674 --> 48:49.092
I blame the government for that.

48:51.762 --> 48:55.932
<i>In a very real sense, the actions </i>
<i>of the government have caused a death.</i>

48:56.016 --> 48:59.061
<i>In my view, they've killed somebody.</i>

49:02.481 --> 49:07.277
[Scott] <i>Blaine was... You know, </i>
<i>this was devastating to him. </i>

49:07.361 --> 49:08.904
<i>All of this.</i>

49:08.987 --> 49:11.490
<i>We were proud of what we built, </i>

49:11.573 --> 49:16.328
<i>and we thought we did the best we could, </i>
<i>the right way we could.</i>

49:17.371 --> 49:23.502
The amount of pressure that these
government agencies can put on you,

49:23.585 --> 49:26.004
it's unfathomable.

49:27.089 --> 49:31.218
<i>For them to come in and just, </i>
<i>I mean, kneecap you.</i>

49:32.094 --> 49:36.515
<i>That's just starts.</i>
<i>I mean, it was devastating. </i>

49:37.307 --> 49:39.434
<i>He was my best friend.</i>

49:39.518 --> 49:41.353
[sniffling]

49:59.454 --> 50:03.625
And we worked together for so long.

50:03.709 --> 50:05.877
Um, yeah, it's...

50:06.670 --> 50:07.754
[clicks tongue]

50:11.049 --> 50:12.300
[sniffles]

50:12.384 --> 50:15.971
Tough time.
And, you know, how it happened.

50:22.185 --> 50:23.603
[sniffles]

50:27.858 --> 50:29.317
[clicks tongue and inhales sharply]

50:29.401 --> 50:33.113
You know, I'm the one
who had to go identify him.

50:33.196 --> 50:34.865
[breathing shakily]

50:44.708 --> 50:47.127
And I'm the one who had to go tell my mom.

50:58.764 --> 51:00.974
[sniffles and sighs]

51:24.331 --> 51:25.832
[Muir] <i>I find the FTC's playbook </i>

51:25.916 --> 51:29.920
<i>just fundamentally repulsive </i>
<i>and repugnant to due process of law.</i>

51:30.003 --> 51:32.214
And every businessperson in this country

51:32.297 --> 51:33.924
should be petrified by what happened.

51:37.427 --> 51:40.263
[Kim] <i>Because I'm married to Scott,</i>

51:40.347 --> 51:44.267
<i>in the government's eyes, </i>
<i>it seems to me I...</i>

51:45.602 --> 51:48.730
just might as well be him.

51:52.984 --> 51:59.407
<i>They can just say,</i>
<i>"Everything she has, we get."</i>

52:01.535 --> 52:06.081
<i>I'm not allowed to have a credit card. </i>
<i>I'm not allowed to use a debit card.</i>

52:06.164 --> 52:10.877
I'm not allowed to make a loan.
I couldn't buy a car if I want to.

52:14.714 --> 52:17.926
<i>Friends and family are paying our bills.</i>

52:18.802 --> 52:21.429
So it's... it's...

52:23.056 --> 52:24.683
it's rough.

52:26.268 --> 52:30.063
<i>Exactly how they go about </i>
<i>the process of taking a house,</i>

52:30.146 --> 52:32.816
<i>I don't know, but they do it all the time.</i>

52:35.443 --> 52:39.990
[Scott] <i>I'm not Wells Fargo.</i>
<i>I'm not Citibank. I'm not Deutsche Bank. </i>

52:40.073 --> 52:41.783
<i>I'm not Bank of America.</i>

52:41.867 --> 52:44.494
<i>I'm just a business guy from Kansas City.</i>

52:44.578 --> 52:48.623
<i>And I get hit </i>
<i>with a $1.266 billion judgment.</i>

52:50.166 --> 52:51.877
It's devastating.

52:52.586 --> 52:54.421
And that's what they wanted.

52:56.381 --> 53:00.635
<i>They liquidate everything you have </i>
<i>to try to pay the judgment.</i>

53:00.719 --> 53:03.430
<i>How do you live?</i>
<i>How do you support your family?</i>

53:03.513 --> 53:06.850
<i>And you don't have a bank account. </i>
<i>You don't have any businesses.</i>

53:06.933 --> 53:10.395
You don't have anything anymore.
Pretty tough situation.

53:25.619 --> 53:27.704
[Zabinski] <i>Yeah, I bet no one ever </i>
<i>in the history of America </i>

53:27.787 --> 53:30.999
<i>has ever been as aggressively prosecuted </i>
<i>as Scott Tucker</i>

53:31.082 --> 53:33.293
<i>for something that's legal.</i>

53:33.376 --> 53:35.378
And yet, still, it never stops.

53:38.465 --> 53:40.926
[Peterson] <i>Eventually,</i>
<i>the Justice Department started to notice </i>

53:41.009 --> 53:44.596
<i>that these lenders were violating </i>
<i>not just state-interstate limitations,</i>

53:44.679 --> 53:47.933
but also the federal government's
racketeering statute.

53:49.976 --> 53:52.687
<i>This statute was originally adopted </i>

53:52.771 --> 53:57.692
to try and deal with the Mafia,
loan sharks, and gambling rackets

53:57.776 --> 54:00.695
and, you know, extortion rackets.

54:04.324 --> 54:06.576
[Scott] <i>We figured the FTC</i>
<i>was our big battle. </i>

54:07.786 --> 54:12.457
<i>But on a Wednesday morning, </i>
<i>in February of '16,</i>

54:13.124 --> 54:19.798
a full FBI SWAT team came to my house
and basically stormed in.

54:20.382 --> 54:23.885
There's a big knock on the door
and I can see from here.

54:23.969 --> 54:26.179
So I rush over there and I look down,

54:26.805 --> 54:28.723
<i>and it's a man just folded arms, </i>

54:28.807 --> 54:30.850
<i>bulletproof vest, </i>
<i>and a pistol in his hand.</i>

54:30.934 --> 54:34.312
And I run back in my room because,

54:34.396 --> 54:37.941
"What's going on?
Please, God, no one get hurt."

54:39.651 --> 54:43.238
[Kim] <i>My understanding is that</i>
<i>the FBI doesn't come and get you </i>

54:43.321 --> 54:45.657
<i>unless they think you're going to flee</i>

54:45.740 --> 54:48.034
<i>or you're about to commit a crime.</i>

54:48.118 --> 54:52.288
<i>And Scott was on his exercise bike </i>
<i>in the basement,</i>

54:52.372 --> 54:55.625
<i>where he is every day, seven days a week.</i>

54:55.709 --> 54:58.294
<i>So that was all about the show, </i>

54:58.378 --> 55:02.048
and intimidation, and embarrassment
and humiliation.

55:02.132 --> 55:05.385
And that's part of their MO.

55:08.346 --> 55:12.434
[Scott] <i>They take me out of here</i>
<i>in handcuffs, put me in a car. </i>

55:12.517 --> 55:16.563
You would have thought
that El Chapo was here.

55:19.607 --> 55:21.568
[Muir] <i>Scott's wife had called me</i>

55:21.651 --> 55:24.738
<i>and said, "The FBI is here.</i>
<i>They've arrested Scott."</i>

55:24.821 --> 55:26.614
<i>I'm trying to assess the situation.</i>

55:26.698 --> 55:30.285
And while I was doing that,
bang on the door.

55:32.537 --> 55:34.622
<i>Twelve to fifteen agents,</i>

55:34.706 --> 55:38.668
<i>all dressed in tactical gear, </i>
<i>bulletproof vests on, guns drawn,</i>

55:38.752 --> 55:42.005
<i>and a tactical shotgun </i>
<i>put in my front window </i>

55:42.088 --> 55:43.173
<i>in front of my little girls.</i>

55:45.008 --> 55:47.969
Immediately, I tell my wife,
"Get the girls upstairs,"

55:48.053 --> 55:51.639
and walked outside and was arrested,
handcuffed and put in a car.

55:55.310 --> 55:59.355
<i>If you want to arrest me, fine.</i>
<i>I clearly can't stop you.</i>

55:59.439 --> 56:03.109
But do you need to come with a SWAT team
and tactical shotguns

56:03.193 --> 56:04.569
at 7:00 in the morning,

56:04.652 --> 56:09.240
when you know I have little girls
and we're on our way to school?

56:12.911 --> 56:15.288
[Follis] <i>We had eight or nine</i>
<i>real good years </i>

56:15.371 --> 56:19.584
<i>until the federal government steps in </i>
<i>and stops everything. </i>

56:19.667 --> 56:22.253
<i>If you want me to name the culprit, </i>
<i>I will.</i>

56:22.337 --> 56:24.297
Southern District of New York.

56:25.507 --> 56:29.052
<i>The Southern District </i>
<i>have got a world of power.</i>

56:29.636 --> 56:33.264
And they are like we are.
They're sovereign.

56:34.474 --> 56:37.519
They can't be touched by anybody.

56:39.562 --> 56:41.940
<i>They threatened to sue us. </i>

56:42.023 --> 56:45.568
<i>They threatened to indict us.</i>
<i>They've threatened everything.</i>

56:46.945 --> 56:50.740
<i>When you're threatened by </i>
<i>the federal government, you go to war.</i>

56:51.324 --> 56:55.703
Just like my tribe did in...
Back in the 1800s.

56:57.997 --> 57:01.126
<i>If you bow down to them, </i>
<i>they're gonna run over you.</i>

57:03.795 --> 57:07.340
<i>And I was advised by my attorneys </i>
<i>in New York to get out.</i>

57:07.423 --> 57:11.261
<i>Do not continue business.</i>
<i>But I didn't...</i>

57:12.178 --> 57:15.056
because we hadn't done anything wrong.

57:15.140 --> 57:18.893
It's a legal business.
If it was illegal, I wouldn't do it.

57:18.977 --> 57:20.562
Hello, folks.

57:20.645 --> 57:25.066
<i>The federal government knocked us out,</i>
<i>but we're still in the loan business. </i>

57:26.484 --> 57:30.321
<i>It's a small drop in the bucket,</i>
<i>what we got now,</i>

57:30.405 --> 57:32.323
but we're building it back.

57:34.117 --> 57:35.994
[Muir] <i>We are facing RICO, </i>

57:36.953 --> 57:40.540
a racketeering act that Congress
passed primarily for Mafia.

57:41.166 --> 57:42.917
<i>We have charges of wire fraud.</i>

57:43.001 --> 57:47.797
<i>We have charges of money laundering</i>
<i>and we have TILA criminal charges.</i>

57:47.881 --> 57:49.632
<i>It is a criminal indictment</i>

57:49.716 --> 57:54.012
and because of the financial harm
alleged in that indictment,

57:54.095 --> 57:57.432
that is effectively
a life sentence for us.

58:09.402 --> 58:11.863
[Scott] <i>I'm sure they wanted </i>
<i>to make an example of me. </i>

58:11.946 --> 58:14.741
<i>They wanted to destroy me financially.</i>

58:14.824 --> 58:18.161
<i>But it even gets better.</i>
<i>All of the money that I had </i>

58:18.244 --> 58:21.539
<i>in my attorney's trust accounts </i>
<i>for my criminal defense,</i>

58:21.623 --> 58:24.876
<i>they took that, too.</i>
<i>And would not release it.</i>

58:24.959 --> 58:30.840
And the judge in New York was forced
to give me a court-appointed attorney.

58:33.384 --> 58:36.888
<i>They said, "Come in and plea </i>
<i>to what we put on the table.</i>

58:36.971 --> 58:39.057
<i>If not,</i>
<i>we'll add these additional charges.</i>

58:39.140 --> 58:41.434
<i>You're going to prison </i>
<i>for the rest of your life."</i>

58:46.731 --> 58:50.860
[Muir] <i>I don't want an acquittal.</i>
<i>I don't want one holdout.</i>

58:50.944 --> 58:53.613
<i>I need to find a way </i>
<i>to explain to my little girls</i>

58:53.696 --> 58:57.450
<i>why those people came to our home, </i>
<i>handcuffed me and stuffed me in a car.</i>

58:58.326 --> 59:01.162
And the only way I get that
is a "Not guilty."

59:04.332 --> 59:08.419
<i>You want to have a policy debate </i>
<i>about payday lending? Let's have it.</i>

59:08.503 --> 59:11.005
<i>You want to discuss whether or not</i>

59:11.089 --> 59:13.424
<i>you think tribes </i>
<i>exercising their sovereignty </i>

59:13.508 --> 59:15.885

59:15.969 --> 59:17.345
<i>Let's have it.</i>

59:17.428 --> 59:21.766
<i>But when you want to legislate </i>
<i>through federal criminal prosecutions, </i>

59:21.849 --> 59:23.601
fuck you.

59:23.685 --> 59:26.854
That I'm not gonna tolerate.
Now I'm pissed.

59:27.522 --> 59:30.108
<i>And I will turn this around </i>
<i>and shove it up their ass.</i>

59:32.068 --> 59:33.987
[tires screeching]

59:34.070 --> 59:35.154
It's a rigged game.

59:44.122 --> 59:46.249
[Jia] "All of my Father.

59:46.332 --> 59:49.419
All of my father's problems
were solved by boxes.

59:49.502 --> 59:52.005
When the dog barked, he put it in a box.

59:52.088 --> 59:55.133
When he had something broken,
he put it in a box. And when his..."

59:55.216 --> 59:57.176
[clears throat] Sorry.

59:57.260 --> 59:59.971
"And when his brother jumped off
a six-story building,

1:00:00.054 --> 1:00:01.973
he ended up putting him in a box, too.

1:00:02.056 --> 1:00:03.891
That broke my heart.

1:00:03.975 --> 1:00:06.644
All of my father disappeared

1:00:06.728 --> 1:00:09.272
All of my father is in a box

1:00:09.355 --> 1:00:11.107
God, why won't he come out?

1:00:11.190 --> 1:00:12.358
I've not seen his face in a year,

1:00:12.442 --> 1:00:14.736
and yet the circles
under his sleepless eyes

1:00:14.819 --> 1:00:18.364
and his bone bare body I can see.

1:00:18.448 --> 1:00:19.574
He's a good man.

1:00:19.657 --> 1:00:23.453
I swear, he's a good man.
He's a good man."

1:00:26.205 --> 1:00:32.795
<i>He was a great businessman,</i>
<i>but reputation is everything.</i>

1:00:32.879 --> 1:00:35.673
<i>And so that's gone. His business is gone.</i>

1:00:35.757 --> 1:00:40.803
He'll be seen as a loser
in the eyes of everyone else.

1:00:40.887 --> 1:00:43.640
I mean, of course he'll still be my father

1:00:43.723 --> 1:00:48.269
and I'll still love him and be proud
of him, no matter what happens.

1:00:48.353 --> 1:00:49.812
'Cause he fought and I know he fought.

1:00:50.563 --> 1:00:54.108
<i>But they're not gonna be the same parents.</i>

1:00:54.192 --> 1:00:55.860
[Scott] I know when you're hungry,
you're hungry.

1:00:55.943 --> 1:00:56.778
Yeah.

1:00:56.861 --> 1:00:59.155
When you said you want
some meat to eat, I said...

1:00:59.238 --> 1:01:02.867
[Jia] <i>There'll be friends </i>
<i>who have read those one-sided stories </i>

1:01:02.950 --> 1:01:07.330
<i>and they'll say, "Oh, don't worry. </i>
<i>I know you're not like your father."</i>

1:01:07.413 --> 1:01:10.416
<i>I'll say, "Yeah, I'm like my father."</i>
<i>I'm gonna defend that.</i>

1:01:10.500 --> 1:01:13.419
Of course, there'll be some doubt
in your mind,

1:01:13.503 --> 1:01:18.716
but I don't think it's ever been
strong enough for me to believe it.

1:01:19.759 --> 1:01:20.843
Uh...

1:01:21.427 --> 1:01:25.723
I'm pretty confident
in my father's innocence.

1:01:25.807 --> 1:01:27.308
My testimony meant something.

1:01:28.851 --> 1:01:30.561
He's an innocent man.

1:01:39.946 --> 1:01:41.781
[Archer] <i>If I was in a room</i>
<i>with Scott Tucker, </i>

1:01:41.864 --> 1:01:47.662
<i>I would tell him that there are millions </i>
<i>that you probably put in a position</i>

1:01:47.745 --> 1:01:51.082
<i>where, at least temporarily, </i>
<i>they were homeless.</i>

1:01:52.875 --> 1:01:56.129
<i>Or they did without electricity.</i>

1:01:57.213 --> 1:02:01.676
<i>Or their water, sewage</i>
<i>or garbage was turned off.</i>

1:02:01.759 --> 1:02:05.555
Maybe they did without food
for a while so the kids could eat.

1:02:08.766 --> 1:02:13.855
<i>Your greed put them </i>
<i>in a very bad position.</i>

1:02:13.938 --> 1:02:15.189
[inaudible]

1:02:17.483 --> 1:02:21.362
<i>And you need to stand up </i>
<i>and take accountability </i>

1:02:21.446 --> 1:02:25.408
for what you have done
and publicly apologize.

1:02:27.076 --> 1:02:30.955
[Jesse Moss] So this is the FTC's
smoking gun. The money bag document.

1:02:32.165 --> 1:02:37.420
I don't even know what to say. This...
I wasn't involved in any of these things.

1:02:38.337 --> 1:02:41.215
Uh, somebody put a money bag on here.

1:02:41.299 --> 1:02:45.636
I mean, I don't even know
how to comment to it.

1:02:45.720 --> 1:02:51.058
I mean, you know, it was a training...
training document.

1:02:51.142 --> 1:02:52.393
And, uh...

1:02:54.145 --> 1:02:57.523
I mean...
That's what I guess the trainer does.

1:03:16.542 --> 1:03:18.252
[man] Get ready to stop. Easy, easy...

1:03:18.336 --> 1:03:21.631
[Chessin] <i>When it comes to</i>
<i>protecting consumers, </i>

1:03:21.714 --> 1:03:28.221
in certain aspects, the free market model
starts to break down.

1:03:30.181 --> 1:03:34.477
<i>And when you have people </i>
<i>who are so financially desperate</i>

1:03:35.353 --> 1:03:41.400
that they will suffer almost anything

1:03:41.484 --> 1:03:44.070
to be able to put food on their table,

1:03:44.862 --> 1:03:49.450
that is where
those who are less scrupulous

1:03:49.534 --> 1:03:52.119
can come in and take advantage.

1:03:55.373 --> 1:03:58.334
[Heath] <i>It was conceived to break the law.</i>

1:04:00.253 --> 1:04:02.713
<i>It was a $2 billion business, and they...</i>

1:04:02.797 --> 1:04:05.675
<i>It was set up </i>
<i>to get around state lending laws.</i>

1:04:08.219 --> 1:04:10.680
It's clear to me that he's a con man.

1:04:13.307 --> 1:04:16.394
<i>I don't know how a person lives with that.</i>

1:04:17.436 --> 1:04:22.441
<i>That they make money by essentially </i>
<i>taking money from poor people.</i>

1:04:23.401 --> 1:04:25.736
<i>And living the high life.</i>

1:04:26.904 --> 1:04:29.282
[Moss] Your critics throw around
this term, predatory lending.

1:04:29.365 --> 1:04:30.992
-Okay.
-[Moss] Are you a predator?

1:04:31.075 --> 1:04:32.368
Am I a predator?

1:04:33.828 --> 1:04:34.662
No.

1:04:36.497 --> 1:04:41.419
I mean, it's just a business.
There was a demand,

1:04:41.502 --> 1:04:47.174
consumer, and you know,
the business was built around that.

1:04:47.258 --> 1:04:49.552
Do you think you're a moral person?

1:04:52.430 --> 1:04:54.181
I'm a businessperson.

1:04:57.435 --> 1:05:02.773
If Scott Tucker were to be found guilty
in a criminal court and sent to prison,

1:05:02.857 --> 1:05:05.818
I don't think there's a prison term
long enough

1:05:05.902 --> 1:05:08.237
that would be suitable, in my opinion.

1:05:14.410 --> 1:05:17.872
[Peterson] <i>Is it gonna be the Wild West</i>
<i>where people can be deceived, </i>

1:05:17.955 --> 1:05:19.373

1:05:26.380 --> 1:05:30.843
<i>Or should we have somebody </i>

1:05:30.927 --> 1:05:33.554
