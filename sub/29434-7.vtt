WEBVTT

00:03.938 --> 00:07.106
GIRL:
Help me, please! No! (grunts)

00:07.174 --> 00:08.407
Somebody help!

00:08.476 --> 00:10.642
Hey. Hey! Look.

00:10.711 --> 00:12.711
Need a refill, man.
Fast as you can.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.713
Best Chop-Face I've
seen tonight, man.

00:14.782 --> 00:16.749
You a<i> Gravedigger's Revenge</i> fan?
Hell yeah.

00:16.817 --> 00:18.751
It's a total deconstruction
of the death industrial complex.

00:18.819 --> 00:19.752
It's great.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.086
Look, hurry up, man,

00:21.155 --> 00:22.087
I don't want to miss the part

00:22.156 --> 00:23.389
where the doctor's face
melts off.

00:23.457 --> 00:24.456
Right, right. Uh,
I got a fresh batch

00:24.525 --> 00:25.791
coming out now.

00:30.297 --> 00:32.798
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

00:32.867 --> 00:35.467
♪ Bang, bang, bang, bang ♪

00:35.536 --> 00:38.070
♪ Boom, boom, boom, boom ♪

00:38.139 --> 00:39.405
♪ How, how, how, how ♪

00:39.473 --> 00:41.573
♪ Hey, hey ♪

00:47.381 --> 00:48.847
♪ You gotta come on. ♪

00:51.685 --> 00:53.018
What does this even say?

00:53.087 --> 00:54.920
Dog? Doug?

00:54.989 --> 00:57.623
Can you look, please?
What's that?

00:57.691 --> 01:00.325
Uh, it says "goat."

01:00.394 --> 01:02.361
No way.
You can read that?

01:02.430 --> 01:03.762
Yeah. I'm actually a little
concerned that you can't.

01:03.831 --> 01:05.831
What does that refer to-- goat?

01:05.900 --> 01:07.766
Uh...

01:07.835 --> 01:11.036
looks like Lasalle was referring
to the victim's tattoo.

01:11.105 --> 01:13.105
Who the hell would
get a tattoo that says goat?

01:13.174 --> 01:15.974
Goat. You know,
Greatest Of All Time.

01:16.043 --> 01:18.177
It's a whole...
Okay,

01:18.245 --> 01:19.344
you know what,
you need this more than I do.

01:19.413 --> 01:20.579
You were up all night.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.181
The only way you would know
I was up all night

01:22.249 --> 01:23.715
is if you were up all night.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.318
Look, neither one of us
want to be

01:26.387 --> 01:27.719
going through Lasalle's files.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.988
So, the quicker it gets done,
the better, right?

01:30.057 --> 01:31.190
Right.
Right. So drink.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.558
Nah, you put Lactaid in it.

01:32.626 --> 01:33.826
Yeah, and my digestion's
never been sounder.

01:33.894 --> 01:35.894
Oh, Sebastian...

01:37.198 --> 01:39.798
...what are we gonna do?

01:39.867 --> 01:42.067
We're just gonna power through.
You know, wrap it up.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.970
No, I mean after that.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.047
SEBASTIAN: All right.

01:55.116 --> 01:56.882
Last of Chris' case file.

02:00.254 --> 02:03.522
I know this was, uh,
hard for you guys,

02:03.591 --> 02:04.723
but it really needed
to get done.

02:04.792 --> 02:08.293
Yeah, his handwriting wasn't
the easiest to decipher.

02:09.730 --> 02:11.730
I just can't believe he's gone.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.100
It's like we're missing a limb.

02:15.169 --> 02:16.602
HANNAH: It's only been
a couple of weeks.

02:16.670 --> 02:20.172
It takes time to accept a loss.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.406
Yeah.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.409
I just don't think
I'm ever going to accept it.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.514
We're gonna find
a new normal, eventually.

02:30.117 --> 02:31.783
Where's Pride?

02:31.852 --> 02:35.721
Uh, he's, uh,
meeting with Dr. Douglas.

02:35.789 --> 02:37.556
Oh. She clear us all?

02:37.625 --> 02:39.591
We'll find out soon enough.

02:42.696 --> 02:45.697
DOUGLAS:<i> You've all suffered</i>
<i> a traumatic loss, Dwayne.</i>

02:45.766 --> 02:47.733
Maybe you most of all.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.735
Well, I think I'm doing
as well as can be expected.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.737
Actually, I agree.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.706
But you need to know that the
grief is going to come in waves.

02:54.775 --> 02:56.475
Been down this road before.

02:56.544 --> 02:58.810
Then hopefully you now that you
have to take care of yourself,

02:58.879 --> 03:00.546
not just everyone around you.

03:02.283 --> 03:03.815
Where do things stand
with my team?

03:03.884 --> 03:07.119
Everyone's completed
the mandatory sessions.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.422
And you're clearing 'em all
for duty?

03:10.491 --> 03:11.790
Yes.

03:11.859 --> 03:13.592
Like you,
they're still grieving.

03:13.661 --> 03:16.795
But they've generally adopted
healthy coping mechanisms.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.731
One of them even discovered
a grief-centered video game.

03:19.800 --> 03:22.334
Gonna take a wild guess
that it's Sebastian.

03:22.403 --> 03:25.971
Overall, everyone's doing
as well as can be expected.

03:29.009 --> 03:30.676
Well, almost everyone.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.147
Fortunately,
for these two young men,

03:35.216 --> 03:36.949
they probably never knew
what hit them.

03:37.017 --> 03:38.684
Any idea which of these
is Trent Weiss?

03:38.752 --> 03:40.819
Not until I pull
the dental records.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.457
This must have been
one hell of an explosion.

03:45.526 --> 03:47.125
Just spoke to NOFD.

03:47.194 --> 03:48.927
Preliminary investigation
indicates

03:48.996 --> 03:50.829
a natural gas accident.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.699
All this destruction
because of a gas leak?

03:53.767 --> 03:55.968
Says she's seen it before.
Saltwater from the Gulf

03:56.036 --> 03:57.703
speeds up deterioration
of the pipes.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.972
They crack, and
natural gas pools.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.474
The slightest spark
could set off an explosion.

04:02.543 --> 04:03.942
But in that scenario,
the leak is caused

04:04.011 --> 04:05.010
by a corroded pipe.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.144
That's not what
I'm seeing here.

04:06.213 --> 04:07.312
What'd you find?

04:07.381 --> 04:09.381
Well, the machine room
is blown to pieces,

04:09.450 --> 04:10.849
but based on the blast pattern,

04:10.918 --> 04:13.118
I think this pipe burst
before the explosion.

04:13.187 --> 04:14.386
Any idea why?

04:14.455 --> 04:15.854
I mean, it's only
designed to handle,

04:15.923 --> 04:17.456
uh, low-pressure gas--
it's what we use

04:17.524 --> 04:18.523
in homes and businesses,

04:18.592 --> 04:20.959
but somehow
highly pressurized gas just got,

04:21.028 --> 04:22.561
like, pushed through it.

04:22.630 --> 04:23.629
A pipe bursting
like that

04:23.697 --> 04:25.564
would release tons
of natural gas.

04:25.633 --> 04:28.300
Then why didn't anyone smell it
and evacuate the building?

04:28.369 --> 04:30.902
She's right. We probably
would've smelled it, even now.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.170
So why aren't we?

04:32.239 --> 04:34.806
Gas company negligence?
Uh, NOLA Gas

04:34.875 --> 04:36.975
is automated. and they have
safeguards in place to make sure

04:37.044 --> 04:39.044
something like this
never happens.

04:39.113 --> 04:42.414
Unless someone manually
overrode those safeguards.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.349
So this is

04:44.418 --> 04:45.851
either epic incompetence...

04:45.919 --> 04:47.452
Or someone did it on purpose.

04:50.724 --> 04:52.257
PATTON:
Hey, boss,

04:52.326 --> 04:54.760
hold on to your seat,
'cause these deets ain't sweet.

04:54.828 --> 04:57.396
NOLA Gas has been hacked,
and they are offline.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.731
I thought city services
weren't connected

04:59.800 --> 05:01.199
to the Internet,

05:01.268 --> 05:02.734
strictly to avoid
that happening.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.237
Yeah, closed computer networks
are impossible to hack

05:05.306 --> 05:06.438
from the outside.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.706
But not from the inside.

05:07.775 --> 05:10.442
Bingo. I just talked to a friend
who works there,

05:10.511 --> 05:11.843
they are freaking out

05:11.912 --> 05:14.112
'cause they are completely
locked out of their network.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.380
When did they lose control?

05:15.449 --> 05:17.916
About an hour before the theater
exploded last night.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.385
They notify the FBI?
Not sure, but I know

05:20.454 --> 05:22.054
city management
has been looped in

05:22.122 --> 05:23.588
and they're directing
all inquiries to City Hall.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.190
Okay.

05:25.259 --> 05:27.459
Start running background checks

05:27.528 --> 05:29.695
on all gas company employees.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.229
I'm on it.
Where you going?

05:31.298 --> 05:32.731
Mayor Taylor's office.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.801
She's responsible for all
the city's municipal services.

05:35.869 --> 05:38.136
Have Gregorio and Sebastian
meet me there.

05:42.476 --> 05:45.077
Let the supervisor know I want
updates every 15 minutes.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.378
Dwayne.

05:46.447 --> 05:49.114
Why is it when trouble comes,
you're never far behind?

05:49.183 --> 05:50.349
Hoping we can help.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.384
One of our sailors was a victim
of the explosion.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.252
I heard. I'm so sorry.
And of course,

05:54.321 --> 05:56.254
we'd welcome any help
you could give.
Well, has

05:56.323 --> 05:58.757
the gas company been able to
regain control of their system?

05:58.826 --> 06:01.727
Not yet, but our I.T. department
is setting up a direct line

06:01.795 --> 06:03.328
from their network to our office

06:03.397 --> 06:05.464
so we can see everything
happening in real time.

06:05.532 --> 06:06.832
I can help out with that.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.500
Can you introduce him
to the guys?

06:08.569 --> 06:10.302
Come on in.
I was just discussing

06:10.371 --> 06:13.105
options with NOPD.
This is Commander Armand,

06:13.173 --> 06:14.773
head of the Special
Operations Division.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.641
Yeah, we go back.
Good to see you, Malcolm.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.510
Wish it was under
different circumstances.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.011
Special Agent
Tammy Gregorio.

06:20.080 --> 06:22.581
Nice to meet you, sir. Any idea
what we're dealing with here?

06:22.649 --> 06:23.982
Well, given the takeover
of the network,

06:24.051 --> 06:26.017
for the moment we're treating it
as a possible terrorist act.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.153
But nobody's claimed
responsibility?
No,

06:28.222 --> 06:30.422
and NSA informed us
they haven't heard any chatter.

06:30.491 --> 06:33.458
Our computer specialist
believes that whoever did this

06:33.527 --> 06:35.327
would've needed an inside man.
(phone ringing)

06:35.396 --> 06:36.962
We've already
looped in Homeland.

06:37.030 --> 06:38.530
I can have them run checks
on the employees,

06:38.599 --> 06:39.931
see if anyone pops up
on a watchlist.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.200
But until they regain control
of the system,

06:42.269 --> 06:44.503
the city's vulnerable
to another attack?

06:44.571 --> 06:45.604
We have to assume so.

06:45.672 --> 06:46.671
(ringing continues)

06:46.740 --> 06:49.307
You need to get that?

06:49.376 --> 06:51.009
Oh, it's okay,
it's just my private line.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.478
Considering what's going on,

06:53.547 --> 06:55.313
maybe you should
answer it, Zahra.

06:55.382 --> 06:57.115
Okay.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.887
Hello?

07:01.955 --> 07:03.155
MAN (distorted):
Do I have the pleasure

07:03.223 --> 07:06.124
of speaking with Mayor Taylor?

07:06.193 --> 07:07.692
Who is this?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.461
You can call me Spartacus.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.997
If you don't want
any more lives lost,

07:12.065 --> 07:13.732
I suggest you do as I say.

07:13.801 --> 07:14.866
(quietly):
Uh...

07:23.477 --> 07:25.844
Spartacus,
we're pretty sure

07:25.913 --> 07:28.213
the theater explosion
was an accident.

07:28.282 --> 07:29.981
You're not the mayor.

07:30.050 --> 07:33.318
No, I'm Special Agent
Gregorio of NCIS.

07:33.387 --> 07:35.554
Well, Special Agent,
we both know

07:35.622 --> 07:38.457
it was no accident.
You're trying to verify me.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.727
Well, can you blame me?

07:42.796 --> 07:46.064
I mean, any crazy can call
with a bogus claim, right?

07:46.133 --> 07:48.867
Can a crazy take control
of the gas company's network?

07:48.936 --> 07:52.504
Reroute highly pressurized gas
through low-pressure pipes,

07:52.573 --> 07:54.072
causing them to explode?

07:54.141 --> 07:58.043
Find the Mayor's
private phone number?
Hm. Probably not.

07:58.111 --> 08:01.847
That enough to verify, or do you
need more tangible proof?
Oh, no,

08:01.915 --> 08:03.181
you've done plenty.

08:03.250 --> 08:05.851
Couple of lives lost
in that explosion.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.252
I want five million dollars.

08:07.321 --> 08:10.255
You have seven hours to pay
or another location

08:10.324 --> 08:11.389
goes boom.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.791
I'll call with
transfer instructions.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.460
No, seven hours, that's not
enough time. We're gonna need...

08:15.529 --> 08:17.562
I'm sorry,
Special Agent Gregorio,

08:17.631 --> 08:19.431
were you under the illusion
we were negotiating?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.600
Five million, seven hours.

08:21.668 --> 08:22.901
Clock is ticking.

08:22.970 --> 08:24.970
(line disconnects)

08:33.600 --> 08:35.767
Same thing happened
in Baltimore, Atlanta,

08:35.836 --> 08:37.269
all across Texas.

08:37.337 --> 08:39.337
Ransomware attack
that crippled cities.

08:39.406 --> 08:41.907
This guy upped the ante.
He's willing to kill people.

08:41.975 --> 08:44.109
Well, so how do we stop that
from happening-- pay him?

08:44.178 --> 08:45.744
No. I wouldn't
advise that.

08:45.813 --> 08:47.412
Pay him, the demands
will never end.

08:47.481 --> 08:48.780
So what do we do?

08:48.849 --> 08:50.582
We find him and stop him.

08:50.651 --> 08:52.918
Need to coordinate
a phone trace

08:52.986 --> 08:54.553
for the next time
Spartacus calls.

08:54.621 --> 08:57.322
I'll loop in FBI and
DHS, get it set up.

08:58.659 --> 09:01.259
Zahra, does the city have
any accessible cash on hand?

09:01.328 --> 09:03.462
Not five million dollars.
Well, how much?

09:03.530 --> 09:05.130
We have a slush fund,
a little over

09:05.199 --> 09:07.299
a million.
Then we'll have to
make that work.

09:07.367 --> 09:08.467
But I thought
we weren't

09:08.535 --> 09:09.568
paying the ransom.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.737
We're not.
But we may need to buy time.

09:11.805 --> 09:13.905
Keep Spartacus talking
until we can find him.

09:13.974 --> 09:15.373
I'll get the city comptroller

09:15.442 --> 09:17.042
to make everything we have
available immediately.

09:17.111 --> 09:19.544
Good.

09:19.613 --> 09:21.279
You established
first contact.

09:21.348 --> 09:23.148
You good with being
point person moving forward?

09:23.217 --> 09:25.150
Of course. He's
organized, methodical.

09:25.219 --> 09:27.486
He knew immediately I was
trying to verify him.

09:27.554 --> 09:30.489
Yeah, so he studied
law enforcement tactics.
Yeah,

09:30.557 --> 09:32.724
sounds like it.
I'm gonna have to play this

09:32.793 --> 09:35.127
as straight as I can with him.
He's smart.

09:35.195 --> 09:36.628
Yeah.

09:38.665 --> 09:40.999
You're smarter.

09:41.068 --> 09:43.335
How's it coming?

09:43.403 --> 09:45.570
Almost there.
We got a direct line

09:45.639 --> 09:48.006
to the gas company's
local network.

09:48.075 --> 09:50.308
You should be able to display
everything they're seeing

09:50.377 --> 09:51.843
on monitors at
the gas company.

09:51.912 --> 09:53.779
Okay, I'd like
to bring Patton in,

09:53.847 --> 09:55.814
have him here
attacking this ransomware.

09:55.883 --> 09:58.183
Any progress, it's vital
that he and Gregorio

09:58.252 --> 09:59.785
are close enough
to quickly communicate.

09:59.853 --> 10:01.453
Yeah, can we get
a two-way terminal set up

10:01.522 --> 10:02.821
so we can get
input control here?

10:02.890 --> 10:06.124
Sure. Just give us
an extra 30 minutes. Marx,

10:06.193 --> 10:08.126
grab a couple more Cat 5s.
(phone chimes)

10:08.195 --> 10:09.427
It's Wade.

10:09.496 --> 10:11.363
Test results came back
on those bodies.

10:11.431 --> 10:12.931
I'll stop by the morgue.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.166
It's on the way.

10:14.234 --> 10:16.067
On the way where?

10:18.338 --> 10:19.538
Did he suffer?

10:19.606 --> 10:22.240
No. His death was
instantaneous.

10:23.377 --> 10:25.443
So, what happens now?

10:25.512 --> 10:28.713
I'll coordinate
transportation arrangements

10:28.782 --> 10:31.516
and the registration of
the death certificate

10:31.585 --> 10:32.918
at the funeral home.

10:34.621 --> 10:36.888
He-he was such a good boy.

10:36.957 --> 10:38.723
I'm sure he was.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.726
I just want you to know

10:41.795 --> 10:44.462
how truly sorry
I am for your loss.

10:45.799 --> 10:47.399
Would you...

10:50.637 --> 10:52.037
(sighs)

10:53.073 --> 10:54.472
Dwayne, what are you doing here?

10:54.541 --> 10:56.341
Oh, I-I...

10:56.410 --> 10:58.109
just wanted to see
how you were doing.

10:59.279 --> 11:00.879
Dr. Douglas talked to you,
didn't she?

11:02.583 --> 11:06.351
She... she did mention
a concern.

11:06.420 --> 11:08.553
Wondered if you felt like
talking about it.

11:08.622 --> 11:10.255
Not particularly.

11:11.458 --> 11:14.426
Loretta,
sometimes it helps.

11:14.494 --> 11:16.528
And I've been told
I'm a good listener.

11:16.597 --> 11:18.496
And I'm a medical examiner.

11:18.565 --> 11:20.198
If I got emotional

11:20.267 --> 11:22.734
every time I have to deal
with death,

11:22.803 --> 11:24.870
I wouldn't be
a very good one, would I?

11:24.938 --> 11:28.240
Yeah, well, we're not
talking about normal.

11:28.308 --> 11:30.008
We're talking about Christopher.

11:30.077 --> 11:32.777
There's nothing wrong.

11:32.846 --> 11:35.714
If there were, Dr. Douglas...

11:35.782 --> 11:37.082
never would have cleared me.

11:37.150 --> 11:38.483
I'm fine.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.354
But I did find something
that's interesting.

11:42.422 --> 11:44.689
The lab reports on our victims

11:44.758 --> 11:47.259
came back
with high concentrations

11:47.327 --> 11:49.861
of hydrocarbons
in their bloodstream.

11:49.930 --> 11:51.763
Natural gas poisoning?

11:51.832 --> 11:53.899
A by-product of it, yes.

11:53.967 --> 11:56.067
No surprise it's there.

11:56.136 --> 11:59.104
The bigger surprise
is what's not there.

11:59.172 --> 12:02.741
Mercaptan--
it's the sulfur compound

12:02.809 --> 12:05.243
added to natural gas
that gives off

12:05.312 --> 12:08.580
that distinctive odor
in case there's a leak.

12:08.649 --> 12:10.548
That's why they didn't
evacuate the theater.

12:10.617 --> 12:11.950
Nobody could smell the gas.

12:12.019 --> 12:14.119
Mercaptan should have
automatically

12:14.187 --> 12:16.655
been injected into the gas.

12:16.723 --> 12:18.323
Means Spartacus has control

12:18.392 --> 12:20.659
of more than just
the distribution system.

12:20.727 --> 12:22.127
If he's figured out a way

12:22.195 --> 12:23.995
to make the gas buildup
undetectable,

12:24.064 --> 12:25.997
he can...

12:26.066 --> 12:28.099
hit any target in the city.

12:28.168 --> 12:30.168
And no one would realize
they're in danger

12:30.237 --> 12:31.670
until it's too late.

12:33.140 --> 12:35.674
If we evacuate the city,
it'll cause a panic.

12:35.742 --> 12:37.575
Then let's try
to avoid having to.

12:37.644 --> 12:39.010
We're attempting to shut down

12:39.079 --> 12:41.079
the city's gas delivery systems
completely.

12:41.148 --> 12:42.447
How long's that take?

12:42.516 --> 12:43.848
At least 12 hours.

12:43.917 --> 12:46.351
(sighs)
That's too long.

12:46.420 --> 12:49.988
Could we implement the city's
hurricane protocols?

12:50.057 --> 12:52.290
I know they weren't meant for
this type of emergency, but...

12:52.359 --> 12:53.858
No, that's a good idea.

12:53.927 --> 12:55.760
We discover his next target,

12:55.829 --> 12:58.263
it'll be easier to
evacuate that area.

12:58.332 --> 13:00.265
I'll coordinate
with Emergency Preparedness.

13:00.334 --> 13:02.033
Thank you.

13:02.102 --> 13:04.336
GREGORIO:
Pride!

13:04.404 --> 13:07.539
Patton figured out how
the ransomware was introduced.

13:07.607 --> 13:09.174
I tracked it back
to when the program

13:09.242 --> 13:10.709
first began overwriting
system commands.

13:10.777 --> 13:12.544
I found the exact terminal
where it first started.

13:12.612 --> 13:14.346
The ransomware
was plugged in

13:14.414 --> 13:15.680
and fed directly
into the servers.

13:15.749 --> 13:17.849
I traced back
the log-in credentials

13:17.918 --> 13:19.117
to the guy
responsible.

13:19.186 --> 13:20.885
PRIDE:
Ronald Simmons.

13:20.954 --> 13:22.854
Computer tech-- worked
seven years in NOLA Gas.

13:22.923 --> 13:24.823
No priors, but according
to his HR file,

13:24.891 --> 13:26.324
he's been written up
several times.

13:26.393 --> 13:27.859
Think he's our Spartacus?

13:27.928 --> 13:30.595
Easy way to find out.
He's on duty right now.

13:35.736 --> 13:38.603
(phones ringing,
employees clamoring)

13:41.108 --> 13:43.408
If I wasn't panicking
before, I am now.

13:43.477 --> 13:44.976
This isn't
inspiring confidence.

13:45.045 --> 13:47.312
Simmons' station is
fourth row, center aisle.

13:52.452 --> 13:54.586
Ronald Simmons, federal agents.

13:54.654 --> 13:55.820
Hands in the air.

13:58.225 --> 13:59.924
(chuckling):
Dude.

13:59.993 --> 14:01.960
What'd you do?

14:05.065 --> 14:06.531
All right.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.534
See what you can get from him,
and let me know.

14:09.603 --> 14:11.736
Ronald Simmons
is in custody.

14:11.805 --> 14:14.339
That's great.
So, this is over?

14:15.409 --> 14:16.608
What?

14:16.676 --> 14:18.510
Isn't Simmons the one
who infected

14:18.578 --> 14:20.078
the gas company's network?

14:20.147 --> 14:21.513
He was.

14:21.581 --> 14:24.082
But finding him was too easy.

14:24.151 --> 14:25.617
Spartacus
is careful.

14:25.685 --> 14:27.452
Leaving an ID that can
be traced back to him--

14:27.521 --> 14:28.553
I'm not buying it.

14:28.622 --> 14:30.055
(phone rings)

14:30.123 --> 14:32.857
We're about to
find out for sure.

14:35.128 --> 14:36.694
Special Agent
Gregorio.

14:36.763 --> 14:38.363
SPARTACUS:
So, tell me,
when you caught Ronald,

14:38.432 --> 14:39.697
which did he do first--

14:39.766 --> 14:42.067
crap his shorts
or pee his pants?

14:42.135 --> 14:43.234
(mouthing)

14:43.303 --> 14:44.769
Try and keep him talking.

14:44.838 --> 14:47.272
Give the FBI time
to trace the call.

14:49.209 --> 14:50.975
You wanted us
to catch him.

14:51.044 --> 14:53.545
You're learning.
That's good.

14:53.613 --> 14:57.115
But you showed bad faith,
and now you have to be punished.

14:57.184 --> 14:58.383
What?

14:58.452 --> 15:00.285
I'm on your side, okay?

15:00.353 --> 15:03.154
My focus is strictly on you
and getting you what you want.

15:03.223 --> 15:05.056
Then stop wasting time
trying to catch me,

15:05.125 --> 15:07.225
and concentrate
on getting my money!

15:07.294 --> 15:09.127
I can't control
other law enforcement.

15:09.196 --> 15:11.262
You blew up a building
and took two lives.

15:11.331 --> 15:13.231
Of course they're gonna come
looking for you.

15:13.300 --> 15:15.100
Perhaps a demonstration
of the stakes

15:15.168 --> 15:16.568
might help them refocus.

15:17.537 --> 15:18.770
(mouthing)

15:18.839 --> 15:20.138
You do that, and you lose me.

15:20.207 --> 15:21.773
You lose me, and you lose
all of the money

15:21.842 --> 15:23.108
I've managed to raise this far.

15:23.176 --> 15:24.609
You work with me,
and I'll give you

15:24.678 --> 15:26.411
everything we have right now.

15:26.480 --> 15:27.745
How much?

15:27.814 --> 15:29.013
$500,000.

15:29.082 --> 15:31.249
That's not what I asked for.

15:31.318 --> 15:32.951
Oh, come on.
I'm still getting the rest.

15:33.019 --> 15:34.252
It's half a million dollars.

15:34.321 --> 15:36.354
Take it as a show of good faith.

15:40.727 --> 15:42.160
Okay.

15:42.229 --> 15:44.462
You've bought yourself
a reprieve.

15:44.531 --> 15:45.763
Check Mayor Taylor's e-mail,

15:45.832 --> 15:47.365
and you'll find a message

15:47.434 --> 15:49.601
with a Bitcoin account number.
I better see that money

15:49.669 --> 15:51.636
in the next 15 minutes.
You will.
You have my word.

15:51.705 --> 15:54.305
And maybe a little less time
will help you and your friends

15:54.374 --> 15:56.608
stop screwing with me and focus.

15:56.676 --> 15:58.943
I'm taking two hours
off the clock.

15:59.012 --> 16:00.645
Get me my money, or boom!

16:00.714 --> 16:02.280
Okay, ju... Damn it.
(line disconnects)

16:02.349 --> 16:03.715
Talk to me.

16:03.783 --> 16:05.550
Did they find him?

16:07.554 --> 16:08.953
No.

16:09.022 --> 16:10.722
Signal was
bouncing all over.

16:10.790 --> 16:12.557
(sighs)

16:13.927 --> 16:15.460
What is it?

16:15.529 --> 16:17.662
Um... No, nothing.

16:17.731 --> 16:20.298
Actually, I want to show
you something. Come here.

16:21.635 --> 16:23.201
(whispering):
Yeah.

16:24.804 --> 16:27.572
I need you to not react
to what I'm about to say.

16:27.641 --> 16:29.374
What's going on?

16:29.442 --> 16:31.009
Spartacus knew we
caught Ronald Simmons.

16:31.077 --> 16:33.545
He called us the moment
we got confirmation.

16:33.613 --> 16:36.681
So, unless he's got NSA-level
cell phone capabilities...

16:36.750 --> 16:38.183
He's got eyes on us.

16:38.251 --> 16:39.817
Somehow.

16:39.886 --> 16:42.220
City hall surveillance cams,
the mayor's computer--

16:42.289 --> 16:43.922
he could have hacked anything.

16:43.990 --> 16:47.659
Wait, so you're saying
he's spying on us,

16:47.727 --> 16:50.028
even here,
in my office?

16:50.096 --> 16:51.429
Yeah.

16:51.498 --> 16:54.098
And he's been watching us
the entire time.

17:05.143 --> 17:06.776
Gregorio was right.

17:06.845 --> 17:08.544
Mayor Taylor's computer
was compromised.

17:08.613 --> 17:10.313
Spartacus hacked in.

17:10.381 --> 17:12.281
Probably heard everything
going on in that other room.

17:12.350 --> 17:13.549
Safe to talk
in there now?

17:13.618 --> 17:14.750
Yeah, broke the mic.

17:14.819 --> 17:16.052
He'll assume it shorted out.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.987
What about here?
Clear.

17:18.056 --> 17:20.790
You think he got into
city hall's surveillance system?

17:20.859 --> 17:23.292
Not sure yet. You want me
to shut all the cameras down?

17:23.361 --> 17:25.661
No, let's leave 'em up.

17:25.730 --> 17:27.063
We'll work around 'em.

17:27.131 --> 17:28.598
Maybe we can use it
to our advantage.

17:28.666 --> 17:30.132
If he got into
the mayor's network,

17:30.201 --> 17:31.734
he's got to be close.

17:31.803 --> 17:33.436
Armand's been
running backgrounds

17:33.505 --> 17:35.104
on all the gas company
employees.

17:35.173 --> 17:37.273
We should have them include
everyone at city hall.

17:37.342 --> 17:39.609
I'll let them know.
Tell him to hurry,
too, all right?

17:39.677 --> 17:41.410
We're running out of time.

17:42.547 --> 17:44.180
Hey.

17:44.249 --> 17:47.750
Hey. Um, Hannah and Sebastian
get anything on Ronald Simmons?

17:47.819 --> 17:49.318
They're talking to him now.

17:49.387 --> 17:50.987
Okay, good.

17:51.055 --> 17:51.988
You all right?

17:52.056 --> 17:53.322
No, I'm pissed.

17:53.391 --> 17:54.924
I should've known
he was watching.

17:54.993 --> 17:56.125
Guy's a computer specialist.

17:56.194 --> 17:57.760
He micromanages
every detail.

17:57.829 --> 18:00.029
Part of his thrill
is seeing the fallout.

18:00.098 --> 18:01.964
No, don't-don't-don't
beat yourself up, okay?

18:02.033 --> 18:03.332
We all missed it.

18:03.401 --> 18:05.801
(sighing):
Oh, God, Pride, no. I...

18:05.870 --> 18:08.971
I just... I feel like
I'm off my game, man.

18:09.040 --> 18:11.340
Imagine we all feel that.

18:11.409 --> 18:12.675
We've been through a lot lately.

18:12.744 --> 18:15.177
Yeah, but I thought
I was doing okay.

18:16.848 --> 18:18.214
You're still grieving.

18:19.918 --> 18:21.551
We all are.

18:21.619 --> 18:23.786
Doesn't mean
you can't do your job.

18:23.855 --> 18:25.855
Even though I'm making mistakes?

18:25.924 --> 18:27.690
You made a misstep.

18:27.759 --> 18:29.525
Not a mistake.

18:29.594 --> 18:31.627
We're gonna get this guy.

18:31.696 --> 18:33.863
Just might take a little longer.

18:36.634 --> 18:38.534
RONALD:
<i> Those two guys dying--</i>

18:38.603 --> 18:40.069
it's my fault.

18:40.138 --> 18:41.537
(sighs)

18:41.606 --> 18:44.006
You could really
help yourself out

18:44.075 --> 18:46.642
by giving us the identity
of the man you work with.

18:48.112 --> 18:49.712
Work with? What are
you talking about?

18:49.781 --> 18:51.180
Who's Spartacus?

18:51.249 --> 18:52.648
How should I know?

18:52.717 --> 18:55.051
A-All I wanted was
some Saints tickets.

18:55.119 --> 18:56.152
Saints tickets?

18:56.220 --> 18:57.653
Yeah. I-I was doing

18:57.722 --> 18:59.722
some programming
on my work laptop,

18:59.791 --> 19:02.358
and I got an e-mail
offering cheap tickets.

19:02.427 --> 19:04.660
I know you're not supposed
to click on suspicious links.

19:04.729 --> 19:06.195
But you clicked on it anyway.

19:06.264 --> 19:07.496
Yeah.

19:07.565 --> 19:09.498
It must have uploaded
some type of

19:09.567 --> 19:11.701
Trojan horse malware
onto my laptop.

19:11.769 --> 19:13.102
Yeah, and then it infected

19:13.171 --> 19:14.937
the rest of the servers
when you plugged in.

19:15.006 --> 19:16.672
RONALD:
When I came in this
morning and heard

19:16.741 --> 19:18.174
that our network got hacked,
I got worried.

19:18.242 --> 19:19.375
So, you're saying
you have nothing

19:19.444 --> 19:20.710
to do with these attacks?

19:20.778 --> 19:22.345
Oh, my God, no.

19:22.413 --> 19:24.347
You guys think that I would do
something like this?

19:24.415 --> 19:25.615
I have kids.

19:25.683 --> 19:27.450
A-As soon as I heard
what was going on,

19:27.518 --> 19:30.086
I-I tried to fix
this, okay, but...

19:30.154 --> 19:32.588
Ronald, Ronald, y-you're
a programming specialist.

19:32.657 --> 19:34.423
You expect us to believe
that you did something

19:34.492 --> 19:36.092
as stupid as clicking
on a suspicious link?

19:36.160 --> 19:38.327
I'm such an idiot.

19:40.531 --> 19:42.098
Look...

19:42.166 --> 19:45.201
you guys, you-you-you have to
stop this guy

19:45.269 --> 19:46.936
before anyone else
gets hurt, okay?

19:47.005 --> 19:49.639
Isn't there... isn't there
any way that I can help?

19:51.476 --> 19:53.109
Actually, yeah.
You-you...

19:53.177 --> 19:55.745
you, uh, program a lot of
the maintenance systems, right?

19:55.813 --> 19:57.113
Yeah.
Does NOLA Gas have

19:57.181 --> 19:59.548
any kind of-of
pressure monitoring system?

19:59.617 --> 20:01.951
Uh, not specifically.
The system's really designed

20:02.020 --> 20:04.453
to monitor lines
for safety and detect leaks.

20:04.522 --> 20:06.122
Well, could it could be
reprogrammed to detect

20:06.190 --> 20:07.890
any areas with pressure spikes?

20:07.959 --> 20:09.725
I guess so.
I...

20:09.794 --> 20:11.160
No... Yes.

20:11.229 --> 20:12.928
Yes, it definitely could.

20:12.997 --> 20:14.096
What would that take?

20:14.165 --> 20:16.999
Honestly? Days.
Or some incredible

20:17.068 --> 20:18.968
programming genius.
Well, luckily,

20:19.037 --> 20:21.037
we know just the guy.

20:24.075 --> 20:26.008
(phone rings)

20:26.077 --> 20:27.510
This is Tammy.

20:27.578 --> 20:29.912
We're on a first name basis now?
Well, it's our

20:29.981 --> 20:32.181
third date.
Thought it was about time.

20:32.250 --> 20:33.649
Got the down payment.

20:33.718 --> 20:36.085
Now where's the rest?
Peed, by the way.

20:36.154 --> 20:38.020
Earlier, you asked me

20:38.089 --> 20:40.856
if Ronald Simmons crapped
his shorts or peed his pants

20:40.925 --> 20:41.991
when he saw the authorities.

20:42.060 --> 20:44.427
Well, he peed his pants.

20:44.495 --> 20:46.128
(chuckles)
Figures.

20:46.197 --> 20:48.698
You must really hate the guy
if you set him up like that.

20:48.766 --> 20:50.633
Trying to trick me
into revealing

20:50.702 --> 20:52.802
some personal information there,
Tammy?

20:52.870 --> 20:55.771
Nah, don't take it personally.
I'm just doing my job.

20:55.840 --> 20:58.607
This Spartacus-- I-I forget--
was he, um,

20:58.676 --> 21:01.510
he was some kind
of Roman slave, right?

21:01.579 --> 21:05.181
A rebel, actually, rising up
against his oppressors.

21:05.249 --> 21:06.982
That's right.
That's right.

21:07.051 --> 21:08.818
So is that what you're doing--

21:08.886 --> 21:10.786
rising up
against your oppressors?

21:10.855 --> 21:13.189
We're all just cogs
in someone else's system.

21:13.257 --> 21:15.725
Sounds like you have some
firsthand experience with that.

21:15.793 --> 21:19.528
I do. But every cog
has its breaking point.

21:19.597 --> 21:21.697
There is a silver lining,
though.

21:21.766 --> 21:23.332
Oh, yeah, what's that?

21:23.401 --> 21:27.002
A broken cog can bring down
an entire system.

21:27.071 --> 21:28.904
Where's my money, Tammy?

21:28.973 --> 21:30.740
It's coming.

21:30.808 --> 21:34.643
Being moved from several city
departments, which takes time.

21:34.712 --> 21:37.012
How much time?
Say, 12 hours, enough time

21:37.081 --> 21:38.714
to shut down
the city's gas system?

21:38.783 --> 21:40.549
Listen, I'm not stalling here.

21:40.618 --> 21:41.751
Shut up!

21:41.819 --> 21:44.086
I'm the one running
this show, not you.

21:44.155 --> 21:45.855
You obviously need motivation

21:45.923 --> 21:48.691
to move my money, and that,
I am more than happy to provide.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.092
Spartacus, listen to me.

21:50.161 --> 21:52.161
I am trying... Spart...
(line disconnects)

21:52.230 --> 21:53.896
Damn it.

21:53.965 --> 21:56.866
You hear all that? I think
he's gonna hit another target.

21:56.934 --> 21:58.067
You did everything you could.

21:58.136 --> 21:59.769
Not enough to stop him.

21:59.837 --> 22:00.770
Is it working?

22:00.838 --> 22:02.371
Yeah, we got it.

22:02.440 --> 22:03.906
These all the city's gas lines?

22:03.975 --> 22:05.775
Patton and Sebastian
worked with Ronald Simmons

22:05.843 --> 22:08.043
to rewrite the programming.
Instead of monitoring leaks,

22:08.112 --> 22:09.779
we're monitoring
pressure changes.

22:09.847 --> 22:12.681
That'll give us a warning to
where Spartacus is hitting next.

22:12.750 --> 22:13.916
What's that?

22:13.985 --> 22:15.251
PATTON:
Pressure changes.

22:15.319 --> 22:16.786
He's gonna blow something else.

22:16.854 --> 22:18.788
He's diverting gas to Gretna?

22:18.856 --> 22:21.190
Doesn't make sense. That part
of Gretna's barely populated.

22:21.259 --> 22:22.591
Spartacus is a
narcissist whose goal

22:22.660 --> 22:25.194
is to punish with
maximum impact.

22:25.263 --> 22:26.929
Whatever he's doing,
it's happening now.

22:26.998 --> 22:28.697
Pressure's
building up fast.

22:28.766 --> 22:30.800
Oh, my God.

22:30.868 --> 22:32.601
The 911 call center.

22:32.670 --> 22:34.737
911 call center's
in the Bywater.

22:34.806 --> 22:37.573
The main center is, but
it's closed for renovations.

22:37.642 --> 22:40.476
We moved everything to the old
emergency communications center

22:40.545 --> 22:41.911
in Gretna.

22:41.979 --> 22:44.547
How many people work there?
About 50.

22:44.615 --> 22:46.148
PRIDE:
All right. I'll alert Armand

22:46.217 --> 22:47.249
to start evacuations

22:47.318 --> 22:48.417
and divert 911 calls

22:48.486 --> 22:49.985
to the Jefferson Parish
dispatch.

22:50.054 --> 22:51.887
Hannah and Sebastian are close.

22:51.956 --> 22:54.557
Tell them to do what they can,
but to be careful.

22:57.061 --> 22:58.994
SEBASTIAN:
That's right, keep moving.

22:59.063 --> 23:00.696
How's it going in there?

23:02.633 --> 23:04.166
Getting the last
of the employees out now.

23:04.235 --> 23:05.601
Ma'am, out front.
Officers will show you

23:05.670 --> 23:07.770
You got to get out
of there right now.
where to go.

23:07.839 --> 23:09.672
All right? Patton says the
whole area's in the red zone.

23:09.740 --> 23:11.340
Heading out now.

23:12.476 --> 23:15.644
It's okay.
It's okay, I got you.

23:15.713 --> 23:17.146
I got you.

23:21.319 --> 23:22.852
All right, come on.
We got to get as far away as...

23:28.282 --> 23:29.415
Makes no sense at all.

23:29.484 --> 23:30.616
Rushing into

23:30.685 --> 23:32.084
a gas-filled building

23:32.153 --> 23:33.285
like maniacs.

23:33.354 --> 23:34.854
That's what the police are for.

23:34.922 --> 23:36.689
You know that we are
the police, right?

23:36.758 --> 23:39.058
Yeah, we're, like,
literally, the police.

23:39.127 --> 23:41.193
Sorry.

23:42.430 --> 23:43.963
There, you're all patched up.

23:44.032 --> 23:46.265
You'll be fine.

23:46.334 --> 23:47.533
Thank you, Loretta.

23:47.602 --> 23:49.201
Mm-hmm.

23:57.712 --> 24:01.447
You okay?
No, I'm annoyed.

24:01.516 --> 24:02.782
You know, people needed help.

24:02.850 --> 24:04.550
Oh, so you
had to rush into danger

24:04.619 --> 24:06.452
like you always do-- all of you?

24:06.521 --> 24:08.254
It's just...
it's part of the job.

24:08.322 --> 24:11.257
There were other officers
there, Sebastian.

24:11.325 --> 24:12.658
Why does it always
have to be you

24:12.727 --> 24:14.794
or Dwayne or any one of you?

24:15.897 --> 24:17.997
It's like you all
have a death wish.

24:18.066 --> 24:19.799
Look, I know you're
not really mad at me.

24:19.867 --> 24:21.133
Well...

24:21.869 --> 24:23.069
you're wrong.

24:25.139 --> 24:27.106
I promise you

24:27.175 --> 24:28.808
that I won't do
anything dangerous

24:28.876 --> 24:30.743
unless it's absolutely
necessary.

24:37.085 --> 24:40.319
There you are.

24:42.056 --> 24:43.989
Loretta's having
a tough time, huh?

24:44.058 --> 24:46.025
Mm.

24:46.094 --> 24:47.493
How about you?

24:49.397 --> 24:51.697
You know, she didn't mean it.

24:51.766 --> 24:53.699
She's just...
she's still hurting.

24:53.768 --> 24:56.836
She's right, actually.

24:56.904 --> 24:58.137
She is?

24:58.206 --> 25:00.639
I ran straight into that
building without thinking twice.

25:00.708 --> 25:03.476
Well, yeah, you know, that's,
that's, uh, that's what we do.

25:03.544 --> 25:06.045
I mean, how many times
have we...
Too many.

25:06.114 --> 25:07.713
And yeah. It's the job.

25:07.782 --> 25:09.682
And it worked out.
This time, yeah.

25:11.719 --> 25:14.887
It didn't work out
for Christopher.

25:24.799 --> 25:27.733
Ordinarily, when the adrenaline
rush disappears,

25:27.802 --> 25:32.638
I just forget about
all the crazy things that we do.

25:32.707 --> 25:35.307
But today?

25:35.376 --> 25:37.042
I thought about Naomi.

25:37.111 --> 25:39.078
What would she do

25:39.147 --> 25:40.846
if it didn't work out?

25:40.915 --> 25:43.082
Who would tell her

25:43.151 --> 25:44.316
that I wasn't coming back?

25:44.385 --> 25:46.786
How she would feel?

25:48.489 --> 25:51.423
Yeah, it's a lot.
Yeah. Um...

25:51.492 --> 25:54.660
I just, I never think about the
dangers of the job, you know?

25:54.729 --> 25:58.430
Just never consider it,
not even once.

25:58.499 --> 26:00.866
Is that a-a good thing
or a bad thing?

26:00.935 --> 26:02.835
It's just a thing, Sebastian.

26:05.339 --> 26:06.572
I know you want
to say something,

26:06.641 --> 26:08.140
but there's just really
just nothing to say.

26:10.645 --> 26:12.411
Thanks,

26:12.480 --> 26:14.747
for letting me
get it off my chest.

26:18.953 --> 26:20.953
Come on.

26:23.357 --> 26:25.691
Hey, what's up?

26:25.760 --> 26:28.694
Wait, what? You got
to be kidding me.

26:28.763 --> 26:30.729
When did this happen?
Wait, what's happening?

26:30.798 --> 26:33.566
Oh, man, I need that van
to get around in.

26:33.634 --> 26:36.068
This is terrible.
Patton!

26:36.137 --> 26:37.803
Patton.

26:37.872 --> 26:40.139
No, no, no.
Shut the door, shut the door.

26:40.208 --> 26:41.774
What's going on?

26:41.843 --> 26:43.442
Something about a van.
No, no, no.

26:43.511 --> 26:46.612
I made it up, assuming Spartacus
was still watching us.

26:46.681 --> 26:48.480
I had to make it
convincing.

26:48.549 --> 26:50.749
I got an idea
where to find Spartacus.
Good, because

26:50.818 --> 26:52.985
we're running out of time.
We've only got three hours left.

26:53.054 --> 26:54.453
Where?

26:54.522 --> 26:55.788
Right here in city hall.

26:55.857 --> 26:57.423
What?
I was analyzing

26:57.491 --> 27:00.125
the computer code
from the ransomware.

27:00.194 --> 27:02.995
I found bits of the same code
in the city's network.

27:03.064 --> 27:05.231
Somebody in the city's
I.T. department?

27:05.299 --> 27:07.066
Which means he wasn't
just using computers

27:07.134 --> 27:09.001
or surveillance
cameras to watch us.

27:09.070 --> 27:10.502
He's been right here
the whole time.

27:10.571 --> 27:13.339
There are over 30 people
in our I.T. department.

27:13.407 --> 27:15.407
How do we find out
which one it is?

27:15.476 --> 27:18.611
That department have
any personnel problems lately?

27:18.679 --> 27:21.480
Actually, there's some
restructuring going on.

27:21.549 --> 27:22.982
What kind of restructuring?

27:23.050 --> 27:25.017
All noncritical
municipal departments

27:25.086 --> 27:27.686
are being privatized
in an effort to save money.

27:27.755 --> 27:28.921
And those employees?

27:28.990 --> 27:31.090
Unfortunately,
they're being let go.

27:32.860 --> 27:35.027
Well, that's why he's angry.
He's being laid off.

27:35.096 --> 27:36.662
Not just about money.

27:36.731 --> 27:38.697
It's payback.
So what do we do?

27:38.766 --> 27:40.799
Patton's little performance
gave me an idea.

27:40.868 --> 27:42.001
We need to buy time

27:42.069 --> 27:43.702
to identify Spartacus,
throw him off his guard.

27:43.771 --> 27:46.505
So I think we need to give
this man what he wants.

27:51.245 --> 27:53.612
With all due respect, Dwayne,
I'm the mayor.

27:53.681 --> 27:55.014
This is my call.

27:55.082 --> 27:57.316
This is exactly
what Spartacus wants.

27:57.385 --> 27:59.218
You pay him,
who's to say he won't just

27:59.287 --> 28:01.153
blow something else up?
Why would he do that

28:01.222 --> 28:02.655
if he gets what he wants?

28:02.723 --> 28:05.124
We don't know what he'll do.
I'm paying the ransom.

28:05.192 --> 28:06.725
Just give us a little more time,
Mayor Taylor.

28:06.794 --> 28:08.961
I've given you plenty,
and you haven't delivered

28:09.030 --> 28:10.729
on anything promised.
At this point,

28:10.798 --> 28:12.798
I trust Spartacus
more than I trust you.

28:12.867 --> 28:14.266
Pay the man.

28:23.744 --> 28:24.810
(phone rings)

28:24.879 --> 28:26.745
This is Tammy.

28:26.814 --> 28:29.581
SPARTACUS:
I'm guessing my fireworks show
at the call center

28:29.650 --> 28:31.016
was sufficient motivation
to pay me.

28:31.085 --> 28:32.751
Or do I need to blow up
a school?

28:32.820 --> 28:34.186
No, no, no. You win.

28:34.255 --> 28:36.021
The city's decided to pay.

28:36.090 --> 28:37.723
She's got Spartacus on the line.

28:37.792 --> 28:39.725
Let's hope she keeps him talking
long enough for us to find him.

28:39.794 --> 28:42.928
How many of the employees being
laid off are working today?

28:42.997 --> 28:45.631
Five. But I've accounted
for all except one.

28:48.269 --> 28:49.601
Steven Marx?

28:50.805 --> 28:52.538
Hell, he was here.

28:52.606 --> 28:55.107
He helped set up
the command center.

28:55.176 --> 28:57.076
I'm looking for him now.

28:57.144 --> 28:59.745
Got him. He's coming up
from the basement,

28:59.814 --> 29:01.513
headed towards the
southeast stairwell.

29:01.582 --> 29:03.048
That exits to the alley.

29:03.117 --> 29:04.883
Send Marx's photo
to Hannah and Sebastian.

29:04.952 --> 29:07.553
Tell them to cut him off.

29:07.621 --> 29:10.756
Two million from the city's
emergency fund, in process now.

29:10.825 --> 29:12.257
You should have it
in 20 minutes.

29:12.326 --> 29:13.459
That's more like it.

29:13.527 --> 29:15.794
You should have taken me
seriously earlier.

29:15.863 --> 29:17.029
I've always taken you seriously.

29:17.098 --> 29:18.864
Things aren't always
my call, though.

29:18.933 --> 29:20.466
Well, you need to find a way
to make it your call.

29:20.534 --> 29:22.301
Yeah, well,
I'm doing everything I can.

29:22.370 --> 29:24.703
Well, I'm still owed
two and a half million dollars,

29:24.772 --> 29:28.607
and there are plenty of places
in New Orleans left to blow.

29:28.676 --> 29:30.709
It's coming, okay?
Piecemeal from every department

29:30.778 --> 29:32.611
in New Orleans, but it's coming.

29:33.714 --> 29:35.180
Excuse me.

29:37.518 --> 29:39.518
(beep)

29:44.859 --> 29:46.492
Son of a bitch.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.660
What is it?
He's doing it again.

29:48.729 --> 29:49.895
Pressure's building up fast.

29:49.964 --> 29:51.296
Where?
Right here.

29:51.365 --> 29:53.365
Spartacus is about
to blow up city hall.

30:08.116 --> 30:10.683
Whoa.

30:10.752 --> 30:12.385
Where's Marx?
We didn't see him.

30:12.454 --> 30:13.486
He can't be far.

30:13.555 --> 30:15.455
Marx doesn't care
about the money anymore.

30:15.524 --> 30:17.857
He's planning to blow city hall.

30:17.926 --> 30:19.826
There's not enough time
to get everybody out of there.
I know.

30:19.895 --> 30:21.661
Gregorio'll keep him talking
for as long as she can,

30:21.730 --> 30:23.329
but we need to find him
and stop him.

30:23.398 --> 30:25.365
We'll cover more ground if we
split up. I'll take the back.

30:25.434 --> 30:26.699
We got the front.
WADE:
<i> Come on, let's go,</i>

30:26.768 --> 30:29.202
hurry.
Let's go, let's go!

30:29.271 --> 30:31.805
Loretta? Loretta,
what are you doing here?

30:31.873 --> 30:33.740
Oh, just
helping friends.

30:33.809 --> 30:35.175
My friends ask to borrow sugar.

30:35.243 --> 30:37.243
Well, this is the kind of thing
that happens with this team.

30:37.312 --> 30:39.512
Come on, let's
get you out of here.

30:39.581 --> 30:40.713
Patton, where are you going?

30:40.782 --> 30:41.881
Get the mayor to safety.

30:41.950 --> 30:44.551
I'm going to get Gregorio
out of here.

30:44.619 --> 30:46.586
I just got a message
that we got the rest

30:46.655 --> 30:48.655
of the money ready to send now.
That's good, right?

30:48.723 --> 30:50.590
MARX:
How soon can you get it to me?

30:50.659 --> 30:52.425
Ten minutes, probably.
Maybe less.

30:52.494 --> 30:54.594
(phone beeps)
Hey, let's go.
We got to ditch this dive.

30:54.663 --> 30:56.396
No, I got to keep Marx talking.
No,

30:56.465 --> 30:58.865
what you got to do is get out of
here just like the rest of us.

30:58.934 --> 31:01.935
Ten minutes? You'll have
to do better than that.

31:02.003 --> 31:03.736
Look, I'm doing my best, okay?

31:03.805 --> 31:07.507
I got to keep him talking long
enough for Pride to find him.

31:07.576 --> 31:09.275
Your best isn't good enough
right now.

31:09.344 --> 31:11.611
You stay, I'm staying, too.
No, you're not.

31:11.680 --> 31:13.880
If the situation was reversed,
and I had to stay,

31:13.949 --> 31:16.282
would you leave me?
Patton, damn it.

31:18.153 --> 31:19.285
Any sign of him?

31:19.354 --> 31:21.354
Negative.

31:21.423 --> 31:24.257
He's not in the square either.

31:31.199 --> 31:33.366
Look, I get it. You're pissed
that you're being screwed over.

31:33.435 --> 31:35.068
You got that right.

31:35.137 --> 31:36.936
People like Mayor Taylor have
all this power and authority,

31:37.005 --> 31:38.805
yet they're
completely incompetent.

31:38.874 --> 31:42.475
Always taking credit,
but never accepting blame.

31:42.544 --> 31:45.545
Right? And then they have
the nerve to play favorites.

31:45.614 --> 31:47.213
What happened to good work
getting you rewarded?

31:47.282 --> 31:48.481
Not kicked to the curb.

31:48.550 --> 31:50.817
Well, power's wasted
on the wrong people, my friend.

31:52.621 --> 31:55.121
Maybe you actually do
understand.

32:01.897 --> 32:04.130
You lying bitch.

32:04.199 --> 32:07.066
What?
I thought we were doing okay.

32:07.135 --> 32:09.435
You've just been buying time
to evacuate the building.

32:09.504 --> 32:11.404
Evacuate?
What for?

32:11.473 --> 32:12.572
Stop lying. I just saw

32:12.641 --> 32:15.141
Zahra Taylor pass me
in a city vehicle.

32:15.210 --> 32:17.810
Patton.
Pride, find Mayor Taylor's car.

32:17.879 --> 32:20.580
She just passed Marx.

32:20.649 --> 32:21.948
Hey, I'm still getting you
your money.

32:22.017 --> 32:23.416
That's what you really want,
isn't it?

32:23.485 --> 32:25.318
Isn't it?

32:25.387 --> 32:26.419
Fine.

32:26.488 --> 32:27.787
You want to play hardball?

32:27.856 --> 32:30.490
I can, too.
Listen, don't do anything.

32:30.559 --> 32:32.926
No, you listen.

32:32.994 --> 32:34.961
You shouldn't have
screwed with me.

32:35.030 --> 32:37.163
Aren't you in
enough trouble, Steven?

32:38.200 --> 32:39.365
You know my name.

32:39.434 --> 32:41.501
Yes! Steven Marx. I do.

32:41.570 --> 32:44.003
I know your name, and I know
a lot more than that.

32:44.072 --> 32:45.471
You don't know
anything about me.

32:45.540 --> 32:47.106
I know that you're
really, really angry

32:47.175 --> 32:48.308
that you're getting laid off,

32:48.376 --> 32:49.542
and that you feel cheated.

32:49.611 --> 32:51.544
I<i> was...</i> cheated.

32:51.613 --> 32:53.179
GREGORIO:
And you have every right
to feel angry,

32:53.248 --> 32:55.515
but this isn't the way.

32:55.584 --> 32:56.549
MARX:
I'm tired of everyone's lies.

32:56.618 --> 32:58.184
You're just like all the rest.

32:58.253 --> 32:59.652
You deserve to die, too.

32:59.721 --> 33:01.821
Patton.
Pride, Marx's

33:01.890 --> 33:04.357
doing it now!

33:06.294 --> 33:09.662
Steven Marx.
Federal agent.

33:09.731 --> 33:11.064
Put your hands in the air.

33:11.132 --> 33:13.967
Turn around, slow.

33:14.035 --> 33:15.001
Easy!

33:15.070 --> 33:17.870
You're too late.

33:17.939 --> 33:19.339
You can't...

33:19.407 --> 33:22.242
(gunshot)

33:28.984 --> 33:30.216
What's happening, Sebastian?

33:33.822 --> 33:35.755
The pressure's going down.

33:35.824 --> 33:38.157
It's over.

33:38.226 --> 33:41.728
It's over? It's over.

33:41.796 --> 33:42.929
It's over.

33:43.965 --> 33:45.298
Thank you, Patton.

33:52.941 --> 33:55.008
(both sigh)

33:55.076 --> 33:58.278
I'll go put this box
in my van.

33:58.346 --> 34:00.113
Oh, oh.

34:02.150 --> 34:03.916
Didn't expect you all
to still be here.

34:03.985 --> 34:05.218
We're just packing
up, making sure

34:05.287 --> 34:07.353
we didn't leave anything behind.

34:07.422 --> 34:09.389
'Cause, no offense,
I never want to see

34:09.457 --> 34:11.224
the inside of
this office again.

34:11.293 --> 34:13.026
Fair enough.
(chuckles)

34:13.094 --> 34:15.194
Thanks for trusting in me today.

34:15.263 --> 34:16.863
If I'm being honest,

34:16.931 --> 34:19.365
there were a few times I didn't
think you'd pull it off.

34:19.434 --> 34:21.267
Yeah, well, if I'm being honest,
neither did I.

34:21.336 --> 34:22.735
Wasn't my best day.

34:22.804 --> 34:25.805
Sometimes getting through it
is the best we can hope for.

34:27.175 --> 34:29.742
But you saved lives today.

34:29.811 --> 34:30.943
And for that,

34:31.012 --> 34:33.012
thank you.

34:35.350 --> 34:37.950
Thank you.

34:43.792 --> 34:46.059
Hey, baby.
Hey.

34:48.963 --> 34:51.497
I want to talk to you
about what happened earlier.

34:51.566 --> 34:53.299
Ah, it's nothing
to talk about, man.

34:53.368 --> 34:55.101
Patton.

34:55.170 --> 34:57.737
Staying with me was one of the
dumbest things you've ever done.

34:57.806 --> 34:59.839
No, ma'am. The dumbest thing
I've ever done

34:59.908 --> 35:03.576
involves crazy glue, a fork,
and a sleeping Mike Tyson.

35:03.645 --> 35:06.245
What?
Long story.

35:06.314 --> 35:08.748
Why, are you mad?
No, I'm not mad.

35:08.817 --> 35:11.317
Well, you seemed like it
when it was happening.

35:11.386 --> 35:12.819
Yeah, maybe,
but I'm grateful now,

35:12.887 --> 35:15.421
because, um...

35:15.490 --> 35:17.090
these past couple of weeks
have been like...

35:17.158 --> 35:18.191
Crap.

35:18.259 --> 35:19.792
Yeah.
And, you know,

35:19.861 --> 35:22.095
we all think we can do it alone,
but we can't.

35:22.163 --> 35:24.297
We need each other.
(chuckles) Yeah.

35:24.366 --> 35:26.499
You know what else we need?
That good stuff?

35:26.568 --> 35:28.167
Nothing but the best.
Yes.

35:28.236 --> 35:29.969
My personal reserve.
Please.

35:30.038 --> 35:31.504
Let me grab it.
All right. I'll
grab some glasses.

35:31.573 --> 35:32.905
All right.

35:34.776 --> 35:36.709
No, I forgot.

35:36.778 --> 35:39.278
She'll have a blast.
(chuckles)

35:39.347 --> 35:40.880
Yeah, okay.

35:40.949 --> 35:42.815
Naomi?

35:42.884 --> 35:44.717
Yeah, she's, uh,

35:44.786 --> 35:47.120
off to a Girl Scout camp.

35:47.188 --> 35:50.923
Is that okay?
Yeah, it's good.
She'll be happy.

35:53.261 --> 35:55.228
You know, I still got
some boxes in the back.

35:55.296 --> 35:57.029
Should we pack up
the rest?

35:57.098 --> 35:58.664
Not tonight, Sebastian.

35:58.733 --> 36:00.299
P and I made
an executive decision.

36:00.368 --> 36:02.135
Oh?
Tonight we drink.

36:02.203 --> 36:03.703
I'm down with that.

36:03.772 --> 36:05.972
Little pre-drink,
and then we go to the bar.

36:06.040 --> 36:08.241
Oh, that is the best idea
I've heard all day.

36:08.309 --> 36:09.509
What about Pride and Loretta?

36:09.577 --> 36:12.145
Uh, they got something else
going on.

36:12.213 --> 36:13.913
Yeah.

36:13.982 --> 36:16.149
Oh, Patton was just about
to tell me his Mike Tyson story.

36:16.217 --> 36:17.550
Oh. All right, yeah.
Yeah.

36:17.619 --> 36:19.252
Settle in, it's a long one.

36:19.320 --> 36:21.754
In a good way.
(chuckles)

36:21.823 --> 36:23.256
So it was me and Mike,

36:23.324 --> 36:25.491
we was in Las Vegas.
Yo, his house is crazy.

36:25.560 --> 36:27.093
He got, like,
these Roman statues

36:27.162 --> 36:29.095
that stand over the pool.
What?

36:56.691 --> 36:58.691
Christopher's old church.

36:59.861 --> 37:01.127
(exhales)

37:01.196 --> 37:03.429
He brought me here once.

37:03.498 --> 37:05.531
Me too.

37:05.600 --> 37:07.800
I enjoyed it.

37:07.869 --> 37:10.603
I like thinking of him here.

37:10.672 --> 37:13.272
His eyes lifted up,
singing a hymn.

37:15.376 --> 37:17.210
He had a nice voice.

37:19.047 --> 37:23.416
Tried to get him to sing with me
at the bar once,

37:23.485 --> 37:24.884
but he-he wouldn't do it.

37:28.156 --> 37:30.089
How'd you know
I was here?

37:30.158 --> 37:31.824
Trade secret.

37:34.229 --> 37:37.330
You're a parish
employee, Loretta.
(sighs)

37:37.398 --> 37:39.932
I tracked your
municipal vehicle.

37:40.001 --> 37:42.635
(sighs) So you're
spying on me.

37:42.704 --> 37:44.270
I didn't see you after
we cleared City Hall,

37:44.339 --> 37:45.705
just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

37:47.742 --> 37:51.043
There goes that
word again: "okay."

37:52.413 --> 37:54.947
Suppose you'll respond
with your old favorite:

37:55.016 --> 37:56.315
"I'm fine."

37:56.384 --> 37:58.751
(chuckles)

37:58.820 --> 38:01.454
You just know me too
well, Dwayne Pride.

38:01.523 --> 38:05.191
I'm not sure how
I feel about that.
Well,

38:05.260 --> 38:07.426
doesn't matter how you feel.

38:07.495 --> 38:10.429
It's true and it's never
gonna change.

38:11.933 --> 38:13.032
Oh, boy.

38:13.101 --> 38:15.334
I tell people every day,

38:15.403 --> 38:17.370
"Sorry for your loss."

38:17.438 --> 38:19.171
Always wish I had more,

38:19.240 --> 38:21.874
something...

38:21.943 --> 38:23.943
more useful
to tell them.

38:25.280 --> 38:27.980
No easy answers.

38:28.049 --> 38:30.316
Well, I'm a
medical examiner,

38:30.385 --> 38:32.718
I ought to be able to
handle this better.

38:32.787 --> 38:35.354
It's just...

38:35.423 --> 38:38.391
Most of the time,
death is clinical.

38:38.459 --> 38:40.893
It's a puzzle
to be solved.

38:40.962 --> 38:43.896
But Christopher was a friend.

38:46.868 --> 38:49.235
I'm having a hard time, Dwayne.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.372
Just hurts.

38:56.077 --> 38:57.643
I know.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.680
Oh...

39:00.748 --> 39:02.915
Must be even harder for you.

39:02.984 --> 39:04.483
You two were so close.

39:07.055 --> 39:09.155
Hard for all of us.

39:10.558 --> 39:12.992
Keep telling myself...

39:13.061 --> 39:14.994
eventually,

39:15.063 --> 39:17.129
it's gonna be easier.

39:20.001 --> 39:23.269
Well, I'll keep telling
myself the same thing.

39:23.338 --> 39:26.238
Maybe one day we'll
actually believe it.
