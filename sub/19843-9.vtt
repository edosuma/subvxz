WEBVTT

03:18.490 --> 03:20.276
I don't like this at all, Danny.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.066
I don't understand
why we had to bring her here.

03:23.660 --> 03:25.901
Never let the enemy
choose the battlefield.

03:26.450 --> 03:28.748
Always work from
a position of strength.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.820
Why should we be enemies?

03:32.500 --> 03:34.957
And don't let the enemy
bait you into a trap.

03:36.130 --> 03:37.540
Let's just take her in.

03:38.960 --> 03:41.622
I'm not turning her over to the police
until I find out what I want to know.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.045
The police?

03:43.800 --> 03:46.553
Do you truly believe
that's where I will end up?

03:46.850 --> 03:49.637
Tell me about my father and the Hand.

03:50.140 --> 03:53.598
Why are you asking about
events that happened 15 years ago

03:53.770 --> 03:55.761
when you have more
pressing concerns?

03:55.940 --> 03:57.146
Tell me what I want to know.

03:58.110 --> 03:59.145
Or what?

04:01.360 --> 04:02.736
- Danny!
- Wait a minute.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.985
Can I talk to you for a minute?

04:22.050 --> 04:23.460
What are we doing here, Danny?

04:24.340 --> 04:25.716
She's with the Hand.

04:28.100 --> 04:30.386
- You want some ice for that?
- Look, I'm fine.

04:30.850 --> 04:32.169
I know what I'm doing.

04:32.430 --> 04:33.431
Do you?

04:33.810 --> 04:35.937
Because it looks like we're on
the fast track to waterboardlng here.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.188
If my father was involved
with the Hand, I need to know.

04:39.480 --> 04:40.469
Why?

04:41.150 --> 04:42.890
It won't change the way
you feel about him.

04:43.820 --> 04:45.356
You know she was responsible for
your parents' death.

04:45.530 --> 04:46.610
Isn't that enough?

04:47.200 --> 04:50.488
Nothing she says
will make you feel better about that.

04:50.950 --> 04:52.440
Let's just be done with this.

04:53.540 --> 04:54.780
So now you're
ganging up on me?

04:59.500 --> 05:02.207
We just don't want you doing
something that can't be undone.

05:06.260 --> 05:07.750
Rand has a lab, right?

05:08.800 --> 05:09.846
Yeah. 50?

05:10.470 --> 05:11.676
Sodium pentothal.

05:11.970 --> 05:13.050
Truth serum.

05:13.270 --> 05:16.091
- If you get it for me...
- ...we'll dose Gao.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.356
She'll tell you everything
that you want to know,

05:18.520 --> 05:19.646
and no one gets hurt.

05:21.980 --> 05:23.140
Hey...

05:25.400 --> 05:26.401
You okay?

05:27.320 --> 05:30.073
Yeah. Yeah, I'm just tired.

05:30.830 --> 05:31.819
What do you think?

05:39.170 --> 05:40.376
It's better than torture.

05:59.060 --> 06:00.300
Hey! What's your problem?

06:05.570 --> 06:08.027
Hey, I'm talking to you.
These kids are playing here.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.076
Is that your son?

06:15.950 --> 06:17.497
Yeah, so?

06:18.540 --> 06:20.121
I have a son.

06:21.460 --> 06:22.791
Okay, and?

06:47.740 --> 06:50.652
Ward, listen,
I don't know what's going on.

06:51.120 --> 06:52.769
I don't know if it's drugs
or whatever, but...

06:53.280 --> 06:55.032
I looked into
the building you took me to,

06:55.490 --> 06:57.902
and Dad bought it
the week before he died.

06:58.830 --> 07:00.707
Why didn't you tell me about this?

07:01.330 --> 07:03.457
Call me back,
tell me what's going on,

07:04.130 --> 07:07.008
or I'll find out on my own.
Your choice.

07:09.220 --> 07:10.209
Danny.

07:13.850 --> 07:14.885
Hey.

07:15.220 --> 07:16.551
I knew I'd find you here.

07:18.930 --> 07:21.012
There's a...
There's a lot going on right now.

07:21.190 --> 07:22.339
Yeah, no kidding.

07:22.520 --> 07:24.897
Yeah, we got ousted.
We lost Rand.

07:25.690 --> 07:26.679
What?

07:27.150 --> 07:28.230
The board fired us.

07:28.650 --> 07:30.390
You've been stripped of everything
but your shares.

07:30.780 --> 07:32.736
- We can't even enter the building anymore.
- Why?

07:33.200 --> 07:34.690
Maybe you should
ask yourself that.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.820
Everything fell apart
once you showed up.

07:37.240 --> 07:38.286
This is my fault?

07:40.370 --> 07:41.450
Yes.

07:41.710 --> 07:42.699
Mostly.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.786
I'm so sorry. I...

07:47.630 --> 07:49.962
And now I can't find Ward.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.120
He has totally disappeared.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.758
Look, I'm... I'm worried about him.
Any idea where he might be?

07:58.890 --> 08:00.221
Me and Ward, we're...

08:00.890 --> 08:02.380
we're not exactly good right now.

08:04.400 --> 08:05.719
He took me to this...

08:06.060 --> 08:07.937
this Art Deco building on 57th.

08:08.570 --> 08:09.980
Said he wanted to show me something.

08:11.530 --> 08:13.816
Then he freaked out,
and we left, and...

08:14.910 --> 08:16.150
Do you know anything
about that building?

08:16.740 --> 08:17.729
No.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.497
I don't believe you.
Why are you lying to me?

08:21.210 --> 08:22.325
Just stay away.

08:23.120 --> 08:24.451
Don't go anywhere
near there, okay?

08:24.710 --> 08:26.496
I'll call you tomorrow.
We'll get this all worked out.

08:26.790 --> 08:28.121
Look, I got to go.

08:32.670 --> 08:34.752
Hey! I'm walkin' here!

08:38.100 --> 08:39.215
Oh!

08:39.430 --> 08:40.590
Ah...

08:43.520 --> 08:47.684
He played knick—knack
on my thumb.

08:47.900 --> 08:51.392
With a knick—knack paddy...

08:52.950 --> 08:54.315
Give a dog a bone.

08:54.610 --> 08:56.521
This old man came...

09:00.790 --> 09:01.996
Oh!

09:03.540 --> 09:05.667
Smells good.

09:06.630 --> 09:07.870
It's a...

09:08.540 --> 09:10.701
Uh. What...
What is that?

09:11.170 --> 09:12.751
You've never seen
pretzels and hot dogs before?

09:13.170 --> 09:15.422
Smells... Smells so good.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.551
Hey! Whoa! Whoa! Wait!

09:20.930 --> 09:22.591
The hell are you doing?

09:29.770 --> 09:30.816
That is nasty.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.402
That's better.

09:37.320 --> 09:38.309
Yeah.

09:39.490 --> 09:41.321
Yeah. Much better.

09:56.220 --> 09:57.209
Are you uncomfortable?

09:58.260 --> 10:01.468
What difference would it make?
You will not untie me.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.675
You're right.

10:03.310 --> 10:06.347
I was just trying to be polite.
I won't make that mistake again.

10:08.690 --> 10:11.853
Regret hovers
around everything you do.

10:13.730 --> 10:14.776
Am I wrong?

10:14.940 --> 10:16.567
You don't know anything about me.

10:17.900 --> 10:21.358
You often find yourself fraternising
with people with gifts.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.784
Daredevil, Luke Cage,
Danny Rand.

10:26.580 --> 10:30.072
You secretly hope that
the thing that makes them special

10:30.250 --> 10:32.332
will rub off on you,
but it hasn't,

10:32.670 --> 10:36.208
and you have failed each
of them in different ways.

10:36.380 --> 10:37.369
Bullshit.

10:37.840 --> 10:39.125
I helped them all.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.131
When they were
beaten up and bleeding

10:42.300 --> 10:43.881
and looking for help,
they came to me.

10:44.350 --> 10:46.090
But where do they all end up?

10:46.850 --> 10:47.839
Ruined.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.181
And the only thing
they have in common is you.

10:51.400 --> 10:52.685
First, you wouldn't talk.

10:53.900 --> 10:55.106
Now, you won't shut up.

10:57.030 --> 10:59.988
You are looking for
who you want to be.

11:00.570 --> 11:02.117
Searching for your destiny.

11:03.490 --> 11:06.744
But it's selfish of you
to involve Danny in your quest.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.571
He has greater problems to deal with.

11:11.540 --> 11:15.795
If you were going to be special,
it would have already happened.

11:17.050 --> 11:19.678
The only thing that can
come out of this for you

11:19.840 --> 11:23.674
is sorrow, heartbreak, and pain.

11:25.760 --> 11:29.059
Sometimes the strongest thing
you can do is leave.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.438
Danny would understand that.

11:34.020 --> 11:36.102
I'm not abandoning Danny.

11:36.980 --> 11:38.811
Not even to save your mother?

11:40.110 --> 11:44.194
How do you know my men
aren't at her door right now?

11:46.620 --> 11:48.110
If anything happens
to my mother,

11:48.290 --> 11:49.655
- I swear to God--
- Claire?

11:50.040 --> 11:51.325
Why don't you take a break?

12:04.140 --> 12:05.710
Hello, Ms Wing.

12:06.050 --> 12:07.711
You don't look well.

13:04.110 --> 13:05.156
Mr Rand?

13:06.990 --> 13:09.652
Hey. How are you?

13:09.950 --> 13:11.861
Okay, uh...

13:12.500 --> 13:13.990
You're not allowed
here anymore.

13:14.620 --> 13:16.622
Yeah, I know. Ijust, um...

13:17.880 --> 13:18.869
I need your help.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.042
Oh, I don't know about that.

13:22.050 --> 13:24.962
I really like my job, Mr Rand.
I need this job.

13:25.130 --> 13:27.382
I'm sorry to put you in this position,
but it's really important.

13:27.550 --> 13:28.847
There's no one else I can turn to.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.632
If you get caught,
you never saw me.

13:35.810 --> 13:36.799
Of course.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.527
What's... What's this for?

13:44.400 --> 13:45.526
_ 1--
- Never mind.

13:45.700 --> 13:46.849
I don't want to know.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.200
It's exhausting, isn't it?

14:01.670 --> 14:03.911
You know, I'm not above
shoving a sweaty sock in your mouth

14:04.090 --> 14:05.125
to shut you up.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.757
I know the burden you carry.

14:08.800 --> 14:10.961
A woman in this world.

14:11.680 --> 14:13.716
You are consistently
underestimated.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.762
Last warning.

14:17.390 --> 14:21.474
Your grandfather was right
to train you the way he did.

14:25.110 --> 14:26.429
You didn't know my grandfather.

14:27.780 --> 14:28.849
This is what you do.

14:29.030 --> 14:31.066
You mess with people's heads.

14:41.920 --> 14:44.627
"The frog trapped in a well...

14:46.760 --> 14:48.466
does not understand the sea."

14:50.430 --> 14:51.465
So what?

14:52.140 --> 14:53.926
That's a saying
anyone in Japan would know.

14:55.100 --> 14:57.978
It was printed in his obituary.
You could have looked that up.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.472
He spoke it to you many times.

15:02.310 --> 15:07.987
Because you always saw the wider world,
understood what was at stake.

15:08.150 --> 15:09.481
Just as you do now.

15:10.320 --> 15:13.483
If you allow this charade to continue,

15:13.910 --> 15:15.116
all will be lost.

15:16.160 --> 15:21.450
Release me and I will allow you to proceed
with your life untouched.

15:22.670 --> 15:24.331
I can guarantee that.

15:25.460 --> 15:27.451
They are coming, Ms Wing.

15:28.170 --> 15:30.502
You know what they'll do
when they arrive.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.138
Get out now,
before it is too late.

15:35.510 --> 15:37.216
Stop talking.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.768
Do you know what he will do
when he finds out the truth?

15:42.520 --> 15:44.681
Danny Rand belongs
to someone else.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.476
He will never be yours.

15:48.190 --> 15:51.148
Your path leads in
a different direction.

15:52.950 --> 15:56.158
Honour the warrior
your grandfather created.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.077
Claire!

16:07.340 --> 16:08.455
You're sick.

16:09.050 --> 16:10.039
Come on.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.809
Rand.

16:33.990 --> 16:35.196
I'm Rand.

16:36.830 --> 16:39.822
No, I'm... I'm Meachum.

16:42.960 --> 16:44.359
Why isn't it my name?

17:16.950 --> 17:18.110
Harold.

17:20.120 --> 17:22.532
Harold Meachum.

17:30.130 --> 17:31.165
Yeah.

17:33.130 --> 17:34.256
Yes.

17:42.220 --> 17:44.723
Ward's birthday. Yeah.

18:35.030 --> 18:36.270
Wendell.

18:37.110 --> 18:38.691
Wendell Rand.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.050
This, uh...

19:06.390 --> 19:08.631
This is my son's office.

19:11.400 --> 19:12.549
Ward.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.279
Frank Robbins?

19:35.840 --> 19:37.796
Who the hell is Frank Robbins?

19:45.100 --> 19:46.135
Joy.

19:47.930 --> 19:49.886
Where is everyone?
What happened?

19:55.060 --> 19:56.357
I need to go home.

20:15.590 --> 20:17.239
I was relieved _
to hear from you, Sir.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.506
I'd really been quite worried.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.127
Especially after Ward and Joy
lost the company.

20:22.590 --> 20:25.002
You never went this long
without contacting me before.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.346
- Is everything okay?
- You talk a lot.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.589
I'm sorry, sir.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.385
No, everything is not okay.

20:32.770 --> 20:34.556
How could they lose the company?

20:35.060 --> 20:38.109
Well, it was the board.
Voted them all out.

20:38.780 --> 20:40.065
Joy, Danny...

20:40.650 --> 20:41.639
Danny?

20:43.110 --> 20:45.442
Uh... Do you know where Ward is?

20:45.910 --> 20:47.650
No, sir, I don't.

20:49.580 --> 20:51.866
Ugh. Hey, got
anything better than this?

20:53.000 --> 20:56.072
- Um. That's your normal drink, sir.
- Uh. You got any bourbon?

20:58.340 --> 21:00.456
In the... _
In the compartment to your rIght.

21:25.110 --> 21:26.850
Is everything
all right, sir? You...

21:28.030 --> 21:29.691
You seem different.

21:29.870 --> 21:32.361
What would you do
if you found out you could live forever?

21:32.540 --> 21:34.110
Oh, anything I want, I guess.

21:34.290 --> 21:35.496
No, be specific.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.160
What would you do?

21:39.000 --> 21:40.297
I'd eat ice cream for breakfast.

21:40.710 --> 21:41.699
Really?

21:42.170 --> 21:44.218
Well, and lunch. Yes, sir.

21:45.260 --> 21:46.375
Amazing.

21:46.630 --> 21:47.710
Thank you, sir.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.630
That wasn't a compliment.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.739
Orders around the front.

22:28.590 --> 22:29.830
Can I help you?

22:31.100 --> 22:33.842
If you don't get out of here,
I will bust your head wide open.

23:48.010 --> 23:50.046
Call me back, tell me whats going on,

23:50.800 --> 23:51.869
or [7/ find out on my own.

23:52.050 --> 23:53.756
Your Choice.

24:12.990 --> 24:14.025
Hello?

24:15.870 --> 24:16.939
Kyle?

24:19.870 --> 24:21.656
After your mother
delivered you...

24:23.880 --> 24:25.529
the nurse wrapped
you in a blanket...

24:27.210 --> 24:28.700
placed you in my arms.

24:32.510 --> 24:34.046
And I thought to myself...

24:36.260 --> 24:37.591
"This is my son.

24:39.220 --> 24:41.051
He'll only have
the best parts of me,

24:41.230 --> 24:43.266
not the broken pieces.
I'll make sure of it."

24:44.560 --> 24:45.891
Why aren't you dead?

24:46.190 --> 24:49.523
Oh, something about the, uh,

24:49.780 --> 24:52.738
treatment from the Hand
made it so if I die, I can come back.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.060
- You can't die?
- No.

24:56.570 --> 24:59.448
No, that's not right.
I did die. Twice.

24:59.620 --> 25:00.609
I was dead.

25:02.210 --> 25:03.916
I was just able to come back.

25:05.920 --> 25:06.909
Okay.

25:07.540 --> 25:09.622
Was everything I did terrible, Ward?

25:09.840 --> 25:11.046
Was any of it good?

25:13.260 --> 25:14.716
I guess. Maybe.

25:15.090 --> 25:16.887
Am I a monster, Ward?

25:18.510 --> 25:19.886
Is that what you really think?

25:20.640 --> 25:21.629
Yes.

25:22.520 --> 25:23.805
Definitely.

25:48.960 --> 25:50.450
I...

25:51.340 --> 25:53.797
I am so, so sorry, Ward.

25:56.130 --> 25:58.587
I've destroyed everything
that ever mattered to me.

25:59.050 --> 26:01.257
I'm sorry.
I never meant it.

26:01.810 --> 26:05.428
Please, please, please,
please, forgive me.

26:05.730 --> 26:08.893
I love you.
I love you so much.

26:09.270 --> 26:10.680
You know that, don't you?

26:11.730 --> 26:13.140
No, I don't know that.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.697
You're my son, and I love you.

26:17.490 --> 26:21.449
I died, and I came back again.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.743
Isn't that great?

26:35.510 --> 26:36.545
Colleen?

26:38.470 --> 26:39.926
It's all right.

26:41.510 --> 26:43.671
The flu... maybe.

26:44.520 --> 26:45.669
Her heartbeat's a little elevated.

26:45.850 --> 26:47.090
I'm fine.

26:48.770 --> 26:52.479
To China and back.
I caught something. It's no big deal.

26:53.860 --> 26:57.773
Just... get Gao.

27:00.530 --> 27:02.020
You're gonna run out of time.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.189
Did you get everything?

27:06.410 --> 27:07.741
Uh-huh.

27:17.590 --> 27:20.582
IfI give her too much,
she'll fall asleep.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.598
If I give her too little,
she'll resist you.

27:34.860 --> 27:36.179
Not afraid of needles,
are you?

27:36.780 --> 27:40.819
You are about to face something
you are completely unprepared for.

27:42.660 --> 27:45.447
You've got something scarier
than a dragon in a cave?

27:45.700 --> 27:48.328
Yes. Yes, I do.

27:51.080 --> 27:52.377
Tie her arm off.

28:16.610 --> 28:17.725
Okay.

28:29.620 --> 28:32.612
That's it? That's all?

28:33.290 --> 28:34.416
Just wait.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.620
What am I doing here?

28:43.380 --> 28:44.426
Get ready.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.096
How did you know my father?

28:49.640 --> 28:52.347
It was your mother that I knew.

28:53.560 --> 28:56.302
She introduced me to him.

28:57.820 --> 28:59.720
I set it up for months.

29:00.070 --> 29:02.857
She was easy to manipulate.

29:03.650 --> 29:04.730
That's not true.

29:04.950 --> 29:06.269
Claire, it's not working.

29:06.780 --> 29:11.444
But Wendell won't have
anything to do with us.

29:11.830 --> 29:14.412
He wasn't willing to make a deal.

29:14.960 --> 29:18.703
But Harold, now,
is a different story.

29:18.920 --> 29:23.584
He was more than willing to partner up.

29:24.010 --> 29:25.125
What?

29:25.300 --> 29:28.542
And when your father found out...

29:30.010 --> 29:31.011
Well...

29:33.230 --> 29:34.629
What are you talking about?

29:35.310 --> 29:36.390
Hey!

29:38.690 --> 29:40.976
That's it. It didn't work.

29:44.860 --> 29:45.906
Maybe it did.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.692
You know, she... she might not have
the answers you're looking for.

29:48.870 --> 29:49.859
Danny.

29:51.490 --> 29:52.787
Hey, hey, hey.

29:52.950 --> 29:54.747
Hey!

29:54.910 --> 29:56.707
My arm. The cut.

29:57.790 --> 29:59.246
It's the same poison from China.

29:59.460 --> 30:00.529
Can you help her?

30:01.250 --> 30:03.047
Not unless I know
what this poison is.

30:03.710 --> 30:06.679
We just put Gao to sleep.

30:06.840 --> 30:10.389
Did you really think
your drugs would affect me?

30:11.390 --> 30:14.882
I spent most of the 17th century
being interrogated.

30:15.060 --> 30:16.129
Bullshit.

30:16.890 --> 30:18.096
What poison did your men use?

30:18.310 --> 30:20.642
It's too late.
Her time has come.

30:20.860 --> 30:23.272
- Danny.
- Hey, I'm right here.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.523
I need you to call someone, okay?

30:26.700 --> 30:29.612
Grab my phone.
It's under "Sensei."

30:33.740 --> 30:35.037
Okay.

30:36.750 --> 30:40.868
Each second you waste,
she draws closer to her death.

30:41.040 --> 30:42.371
- Shut up!
- Voice mail.

30:42.550 --> 30:44.165
Hi, this is a friend of Colleen's. Uh...

30:44.380 --> 30:46.917
She's... She's been poisoned.
She's asking for you.

30:47.090 --> 30:48.216
We're at her dojo.

30:59.440 --> 31:01.351
Target Danny Rand
spotted at Chikara Dojo.

31:05.440 --> 31:06.600
Copy that.

31:09.740 --> 31:13.028
So... what do you want, Ward?

31:14.120 --> 31:16.111
I'll do anything you ask.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.956
I want you to leave me alone.

31:24.840 --> 31:26.831
I don't want any part of Rand...

31:29.130 --> 31:30.882
or any of this insanity.

31:31.800 --> 31:34.462
I want my own life away from you.

31:37.220 --> 31:38.471
I understand.

31:39.060 --> 31:40.436
So you'll let me go?

31:41.100 --> 31:45.139
I want my family back,
healthy and whole. I mean it.

31:46.650 --> 31:48.811
I'll do anything,
anything to make that happen.

31:51.570 --> 31:54.152
I was only trying to toughen you up
so you could...

31:55.450 --> 31:57.827
face this world and win.

31:59.540 --> 32:01.360
I hope someday you
can understand that.

32:02.290 --> 32:03.575
Then I can go?

32:04.420 --> 32:06.832
Well, if that's what it takes, yes.

32:18.310 --> 32:19.345
Thank you.

32:20.640 --> 32:23.518
Oh, I just want what's best
for you and your, uh, sister.

32:24.940 --> 32:27.932
You know, I hope
she'll be more forgiving.

32:29.030 --> 32:30.645
You can't bring Joy into this.

32:30.860 --> 32:33.192
I don't have any other option.
She's my only daughter.

32:35.030 --> 32:40.366
Dad, if you do that,
the Hand will kill her.

32:40.580 --> 32:43.538
Well, I've been working on something
that's going to put an end to all that.

32:43.960 --> 32:44.949
What?

32:45.130 --> 32:46.950
Ward...

32:47.840 --> 32:49.330
You wanted to leave.

32:50.170 --> 32:51.501
So leave.

32:54.220 --> 32:55.209
We'll be fine.

33:19.450 --> 33:21.327
We're gonna get out of here.

33:21.540 --> 33:22.655
Everything's gonna be okay.

33:22.870 --> 33:25.452
I don't know.

33:26.080 --> 33:27.206
Say it.

33:27.750 --> 33:29.240
We're gonna be okay.

33:31.380 --> 33:33.211
- We're gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

33:35.050 --> 33:36.790
You're such children.

33:36.970 --> 33:38.255
Ignore her.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.671
We're gonna get through this.
Right, Claire?

33:43.100 --> 33:44.089
Yep.

33:49.230 --> 33:51.858
Time is up, Danny Rand.

33:52.400 --> 33:56.109
Your friends are going to die
because of you.

33:56.450 --> 33:58.020
Don't panic. Breathe.

33:58.990 --> 34:00.526
Your eyes will get
adjusted to the dark.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.279
What was that?

34:11.460 --> 34:13.416
Camera.

34:14.090 --> 34:15.660
They're getting
the lay of the land.

34:20.970 --> 34:21.959
Shit!

34:35.400 --> 34:36.981
Danny!

34:37.280 --> 34:38.440
Surround Gao!

35:14.480 --> 35:16.232
Whoo!

35:21.910 --> 35:25.653
Claire, Colleen, you okay?

35:25.950 --> 35:27.247
Yeah.

35:27.540 --> 35:28.655
Yeah.

35:31.040 --> 35:32.496
We need to tie these guys up.

35:34.090 --> 35:36.957
This is not ninja shit.

35:38.630 --> 35:40.370
These guys are military.

35:43.720 --> 35:45.551
Don't move.

35:47.890 --> 35:49.721
Look to your girlfriend, Danny.

35:50.730 --> 35:52.971
She doesn't have
much longer to live.

35:54.730 --> 35:56.971
You escort me to my people,

35:57.190 --> 36:00.899
I will give Claire safe
passage to help young Colleen.

36:01.320 --> 36:04.232
I will have the antidote
ready and waiting outside.

36:04.450 --> 36:06.611
But you must decide now.

36:06.910 --> 36:10.289
She's lying. Don't do it.

36:19.420 --> 36:21.627
That you understand
what they can do.

36:22.760 --> 36:25.172
Name your price.

36:25.430 --> 36:29.799
No amount of money will buy the answer
you are looking for.

36:30.310 --> 36:31.880
There has to be a way to kill him.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.641
There is a legend about a shepherd...

36:39.360 --> 36:41.772
from the village of my great-grandfather.

36:43.570 --> 36:46.778
He made an arrangement
with the Hand, just like your father.

36:47.740 --> 36:49.196
He was killed on the battlefield.

36:49.950 --> 36:51.110
More than once.

36:52.290 --> 36:54.997
And every time he arrived
back at the village,

36:55.170 --> 36:56.956
his wife was overjoyed.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.958
It seemed like such a miraculous gift.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.835
But it wasn't.

37:04.640 --> 37:07.256
Each time he came back...

37:07.800 --> 37:09.051
he was worse.

37:11.810 --> 37:14.187
One night, without warning,

37:14.560 --> 37:16.937
he took two of his own children...

37:18.980 --> 37:20.641
and roasted them on a fire.

37:21.530 --> 37:22.940
When his wife discovered it,

37:23.240 --> 37:26.812
she fled with her only
remaining child in her arms.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.824
They destroy the ones
closest to them first.

37:36.960 --> 37:38.996
The only solution is to run.

38:37.140 --> 38:39.051
Finished for the day?

38:39.350 --> 38:41.477
Yes, sir. If... If that's all right?

38:41.730 --> 38:43.277
- Of course. Of course.
- Okay.

38:43.530 --> 38:46.897
Hey, before you go,
come up here.

38:49.280 --> 38:52.488
It's been a long, strange day.

38:56.580 --> 38:58.411
I thought we should celebrate.

38:59.420 --> 39:00.569
Wow!

39:00.880 --> 39:03.587
I didn't know which
was your favourite, so...

39:04.710 --> 39:06.416
- Mr Meachum, you didn't--
- Oh, please...

39:06.840 --> 39:07.909
call me Harold.

39:10.180 --> 39:11.545
Now, I think...

39:12.600 --> 39:15.808
I think I'm gonna have
this organic cornflakes one.

39:16.770 --> 39:17.919
Mm.

39:18.190 --> 39:19.430
In all the time I've worked for you,

39:19.520 --> 39:21.602
I don't think I've ever seen you
eat any dairy or sugar.

39:23.110 --> 39:24.680
Well, I'm a new man, Kyle.

39:25.110 --> 39:26.429
I'm a new man in every way.

39:27.490 --> 39:29.026
Hm. Yeah.

39:29.450 --> 39:30.439
Is there any vanilla?

39:36.540 --> 39:37.609
What?

39:39.460 --> 39:41.030
Well, I don't like
all these fancy flavours.

39:41.210 --> 39:42.700
Vanilla's fine for me.

39:48.300 --> 39:51.792
I go to all the trouble of, uh,
getting you all this ice cream,

39:51.970 --> 39:53.346
and all you can do is complain.

39:53.510 --> 39:56.092
Oh! No, no, no! I'm... I'm sorry.

39:56.260 --> 39:58.091
I didn't mean to complain.

39:58.270 --> 39:59.669
Uh. This is great, really.

39:59.850 --> 40:01.681
I can just eat this.

40:02.270 --> 40:05.512
You're not gonna eat anything,
you ungrateful little shit!

40:07.230 --> 40:08.777
Sorry. I'm sorry.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.231
No, you're not!

40:11.490 --> 40:14.982
Please stop. I'm sorry.

40:15.240 --> 40:16.446
Yeah, I'll give you sorry.

40:23.670 --> 40:24.876
Hey, what's that?

40:25.090 --> 40:26.876
It's just... It's just ice cream.

40:27.090 --> 40:28.375
Oh, shut up and die.

40:42.600 --> 40:43.806
It's okay.

40:46.610 --> 40:47.759
It's okay.

40:49.690 --> 40:51.237
I've been where you're going.

40:52.650 --> 40:53.856
It's not so bad.

40:54.870 --> 40:56.110
It's just...

40:59.120 --> 41:00.439
nothingness.

41:08.210 --> 41:09.290
Kyle?

41:12.170 --> 41:13.216
Kyle?

41:17.390 --> 41:18.379
Kyle?

41:25.940 --> 41:27.180
Jesus!

41:29.360 --> 41:31.100
Oh, what did I do?

41:51.210 --> 41:52.199
Hey!

41:52.920 --> 41:54.376
What are you doing?

41:55.340 --> 41:56.420
Ward Meachum?

41:56.640 --> 41:57.629
Yeah?

41:57.800 --> 41:58.846
Step over here, please.

41:59.470 --> 42:00.880
What is going on?

42:01.060 --> 42:02.425
Step over here, please.

42:08.060 --> 42:10.608
- This your car?
- I...

42:10.770 --> 42:11.816
This is...

42:18.110 --> 42:19.156
I want a lawyer.

42:19.620 --> 42:20.609
Already?

42:21.160 --> 42:25.039
This isn't mine. This is a set up.
Someone set me up!

42:25.790 --> 42:28.873
You cannot search
my car Without cause.

42:29.420 --> 42:32.048
It was on the seat. Cause.

42:33.460 --> 42:34.916
You think I'm that stupid?

42:36.220 --> 42:38.120
Turn to the car.
Hands on the hood.

42:54.150 --> 42:56.482
Oh, my God. Really?

42:58.070 --> 42:59.446
Are we really gonna do this?

42:59.660 --> 43:00.866
What is that?

43:01.240 --> 43:02.275
What are we gonna do?

43:03.580 --> 43:06.242
You sit there, take notes
about how screwed up I am,

43:06.410 --> 43:09.322
prescribe some meds,
send me back to some kind of cell.

43:09.670 --> 43:12.628
I know how the whole
72-hour-hold business works.

43:12.960 --> 43:14.791
Is that why you think you're here?

43:15.130 --> 43:20.329
I'm here because my dad
had drugs planted in my car.

43:21.390 --> 43:22.459
Your dad?

43:23.350 --> 43:24.635
Listen...

43:25.640 --> 43:28.438
this is way too complicated
for you to understand.

43:29.690 --> 43:30.679
Try me.

43:33.980 --> 43:37.529
You see, that's the trap.
And he knows it.

43:38.900 --> 43:41.778
IfI start talking about him,
then you'll say...

43:42.450 --> 43:43.986
He's been dead for 13 years.

43:44.200 --> 43:45.360
Exactly.

43:46.330 --> 43:50.243
So I'm damned ifI do
and damned if I don't.

43:51.330 --> 43:52.627
That's how he works.

43:56.670 --> 43:58.251
Then what do you suggest we do?

43:59.720 --> 44:02.336
You just let me out of here.
I will take you to him.

44:03.680 --> 44:04.669
End of story.

44:06.220 --> 44:08.051
But you see, Ward,
that's a risky proposition

44:08.220 --> 44:10.222
for a dual diagnosis patient.

44:10.600 --> 44:11.976
Dual diagnosis?

44:12.900 --> 44:15.357
You're an addict
and you have psychological disorders,

44:15.520 --> 44:18.603
- so we have to proceed very...
- I'm not an addict.

44:19.400 --> 44:22.699
The heroin that the cops found
in your car tells a different story.

44:25.830 --> 44:29.038
As does your father’s
very public death from cancer.

44:32.210 --> 44:36.032
So, where would you Me to begin?

46:34.250 --> 46:35.285
Daddy?

46:36.000 --> 46:37.160
Hello, Joy.

46:40.380 --> 46:41.995
I missed you so much.

46:43.130 --> 46:44.666
How are you still alive?

46:47.880 --> 46:49.336
You were in a casket.

46:50.550 --> 46:51.710
I know.

46:57.140 --> 46:59.517
I'm so sorry you saw me like that.

47:15.830 --> 47:17.741
You've grown up so much.

47:20.500 --> 47:21.535
What...

47:26.420 --> 47:27.409
Joy.

47:28.420 --> 47:29.421
It's okay.

47:32.510 --> 47:33.590
Dad?

47:39.190 --> 47:40.726
My Joy.

47:43.020 --> 47:44.260
My Joy.

47:47.440 --> 47:48.850
She is a fighter.

47:49.360 --> 47:52.067
But once the poison
reaches her brain...

47:54.870 --> 47:56.656
There has to be
something else we can do.

47:56.950 --> 47:58.440
This is beyond me, Danny.

48:02.750 --> 48:04.627
If she dies, you die.

48:10.720 --> 48:12.836
Colleen, it's me.

48:13.050 --> 48:15.632
- Sensei?
- Yes.

48:17.560 --> 48:18.629
Colleen?

48:18.850 --> 48:20.135
Open the door.

48:20.310 --> 48:23.017
Hey, hey,
hey, relax. Relax.

48:27.820 --> 48:30.641
How did you get up here?
There's soldiers everywhere.

48:31.490 --> 48:33.947
I've taken care _
of Madame Gao's mercenaries.

48:34.820 --> 48:36.822
How do we know
that this isn't another trap?

48:36.990 --> 48:38.480
Look out your window.

48:43.000 --> 48:43.989
Now...

48:44.750 --> 48:46.957
Please, open the door.

48:47.130 --> 48:49.951
You have no business here.
Leave!

49:11.320 --> 49:12.810
You should have
called me sooner.

49:13.820 --> 49:14.809
Who are you?

49:15.200 --> 49:17.236
My name is Bakuto.

49:18.530 --> 49:20.111
SenseL

49:21.660 --> 49:22.820
You came.

49:23.000 --> 49:24.911
Of course.

49:26.380 --> 49:27.529
She's dying.

49:29.300 --> 49:32.121
Help her.
We're running out of time.

49:32.300 --> 49:33.790
You are the Iron Fist, yes?

49:34.260 --> 49:35.249
Yes.

49:35.680 --> 49:36.965
Then heal her.

49:37.140 --> 49:38.459
What are you talking about?

49:38.640 --> 49:40.005
Danny, we're in trouble here.

49:43.690 --> 49:44.839
What are you waiting for?

49:45.020 --> 49:48.228
_ You are about to fall
Into a trap you cannot escape.

49:48.400 --> 49:50.470
I don't understand
what you're asking me to do.

49:52.820 --> 49:54.139
You weren't taught this.

49:56.070 --> 49:57.059
Come.

50:03.200 --> 50:04.861
You know how to centre your chi,

50:05.040 --> 50:06.701
and then move that
energy Into your hand?

50:08.000 --> 50:09.080
Of course.

50:09.250 --> 50:11.161
Then do it. Now.

50:22.430 --> 50:23.556
Good.

50:24.520 --> 50:27.512
Now, open your fist...

50:41.870 --> 50:45.192
Now, place your
hand over the poison...

50:54.130 --> 50:55.791
Focus on it.

51:00.470 --> 51:01.960
Do you sense the poison?

51:04.520 --> 51:05.509
Yes.

51:05.890 --> 51:07.596
And do you sense her life force?

51:08.310 --> 51:09.686
They should feel different.

51:10.230 --> 51:11.219
Yes.

51:12.980 --> 51:16.643
Use your chi to burn the poison away.

51:37.840 --> 51:38.920
Danny!

51:39.090 --> 51:40.637
Sweet Christmas, it worked!

51:41.140 --> 51:42.175
You're safe.

51:47.520 --> 51:50.432
Danny! You okay, there?

51:52.110 --> 51:53.099
Yeah.

51:54.820 --> 51:55.855
I'm fine.

51:57.280 --> 51:59.020
Danny!

51:59.990 --> 52:03.653
"The frog in the well
never understands the sea."

52:14.170 --> 52:15.876
Where are you taking him?

52:16.050 --> 52:17.369
Colleen, what's going on?

52:17.630 --> 52:19.507
We're helping him. Trust me.

52:20.510 --> 52:21.545
I'm going with you.

52:22.470 --> 52:25.132
No. Where we're going,
you're not allowed.

52:26.640 --> 52:27.629
Claire.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.187
Everything is gonna be okay.

52:34.060 --> 52:35.357
Wait a minute, goddamn it!
