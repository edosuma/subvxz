WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:02.765
Ah, you know what?
Just remind me.

00:02.799 --> 00:05.067
I got to write a thank-you note
to the guy who invented waffles.

00:05.244 --> 00:09.482
The recipe first appeared
in <i>Le Ménagier de Paris,</i> a book

00:09.483 --> 00:12.018
a husband wrote for his wife
in the 14th century.

00:12.052 --> 00:14.487
Since he's dead,
a note would be pointless.

00:14.521 --> 00:17.490
I pity the men who aren't
married to you, Bones.

00:17.524 --> 00:19.359
Booth, did you see
what Christine brought home

00:19.393 --> 00:20.593
from preschool?

00:20.627 --> 00:22.061
Hey, look at
that, huh?

00:22.096 --> 00:24.464
15th place winner
in an egg race. Huh.

00:24.498 --> 00:26.632
Our little girl's
a champion.

00:26.667 --> 00:29.135
Booth, there are only
15 children in the class.

00:29.169 --> 00:30.603
What do you want me to do?

00:30.637 --> 00:32.372
Get her a trainer
so we could work her harder?

00:32.406 --> 00:34.440
If she's 15th,
that means that she lost.

00:34.475 --> 00:36.976
Children need to understand
what losing means.

00:37.011 --> 00:38.911
It's an egg race.

00:38.946 --> 00:41.280
When I was a child,
I played blackjack with Max,

00:41.315 --> 00:42.682
and he never let me win.

00:42.716 --> 00:44.117
I lost my allowance,

00:44.151 --> 00:46.019
but I got a realistic view
of the world.

00:46.053 --> 00:47.453
Your dad took your allowance?

00:47.488 --> 00:49.856
Won it. Actually,
he won the marker he gave me

00:49.890 --> 00:52.392
that said he owed me the allowance.
I don't think

00:52.426 --> 00:54.394
we should use your father as
an example here. It's not...

00:54.428 --> 00:56.062
Oh. Brennan.

00:56.096 --> 00:58.498
Okay, I'm on my way.
Wait. Wait. Wait a second.

00:58.532 --> 01:00.700
What about the waffle I just made you?
Sorry.

01:00.734 --> 01:02.168
A body's on its way to the lab.

01:02.202 --> 01:03.836
More for you.
I'll call if it concerns you.

01:03.871 --> 01:07.040
I got waffles flying
all over the place here.

01:08.142 --> 01:10.743
That's hot. That's hot.

01:13.847 --> 01:16.049
The remains are
in the pig troughs?

01:16.083 --> 01:19.652
Yes. I am setting up
a filtration system

01:19.686 --> 01:22.755
that will allow us to separate
liquid in the pig slop

01:22.790 --> 01:25.191
from any human remains,

01:25.225 --> 01:28.428
such as tissue,
bones, organs...

01:28.462 --> 01:30.963
But you're not waiting.
I was told

01:30.998 --> 01:33.833
the body was dumped
on a pig farm in Virginia.

01:33.867 --> 01:35.368
Yeah.

01:35.402 --> 01:37.870
So the noise of the pigs feeding
woke up the farmer,

01:37.905 --> 01:39.639
so he was able to stop them

01:39.673 --> 01:41.641
before they finished eating
all the human remains.

01:41.675 --> 01:43.443
I need an intern.
Where's Oliver Wells?

01:43.477 --> 01:45.278
Out of town on family business.

01:45.312 --> 01:48.114
Dr. Brennan, Dr. Hodgins,
you remember Dr. Filmore?

01:48.148 --> 01:49.749
It's our favorite Canadian

01:49.783 --> 01:51.484
forensic podiatrist.

01:51.518 --> 01:53.119
Hello, Dr. Hodgins.

01:53.153 --> 01:54.787
Dr. Brennan, it's a pleasure
to be working with you again.

01:54.822 --> 01:57.457
I'm afraid there will be
no pleasure, Dr. Filmore.

01:57.491 --> 01:59.325
His field is forensic podiatry.

01:59.359 --> 02:02.061
Dr. Filmore is writing a report

02:02.096 --> 02:03.796
at the request
of the FBI

02:03.831 --> 02:05.431
and the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police

02:05.466 --> 02:08.101
on cooperation between
the United States and Canada

02:08.134 --> 02:09.936
in the field of
forensic sciences.

02:09.970 --> 02:12.038
It's the first trans-border
study in forensic cooperation

02:12.072 --> 02:13.739
between our two
great nations.

02:13.774 --> 02:15.141
No. I can't allow that.

02:15.175 --> 02:17.210
We're in the middle
of an investigation.

02:17.244 --> 02:19.278
Hmm.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.447
What are you doing?

02:21.482 --> 02:22.949
Notes for my report.

02:22.983 --> 02:25.318
"Check American definition
of 'cooperation.'"

02:25.352 --> 02:26.953
Dr. Filmore

02:26.987 --> 02:28.588
will be your intern so he can

02:28.622 --> 02:29.956
observe firsthand that

02:29.990 --> 02:32.425
our definition
of cooperation is the same

02:32.459 --> 02:33.759
as our neighbors to the north.

02:33.794 --> 02:35.261
By his own admission,

02:35.295 --> 02:37.263
he's familiar with only 25%

02:37.297 --> 02:39.398
of the bones in the human body.

02:39.433 --> 02:42.135
Actually, I just completed
my PhD in forensic anthropology,

02:42.169 --> 02:45.505
so I am now fully qualified
to work with you...

02:45.539 --> 02:47.340
as a peer.

02:48.976 --> 02:51.110
Then that settles it.

02:51.145 --> 02:53.045
Now, if you'll
excuse me.

02:53.080 --> 02:54.647
Put on some gloves.

02:54.681 --> 02:57.083
We're looking for human remains
in these troughs.

02:57.117 --> 02:58.851
We might not be able to recover

02:58.886 --> 03:00.286
a complete
skeleton because...

03:00.320 --> 03:02.221
Because pigs eat human bones.

03:02.256 --> 03:04.323
I grew up
on a farm in Manitoba.

03:11.665 --> 03:13.366
Angela...

03:13.400 --> 03:16.469
Oh, hey. I can't do anything
until I have a skull,

03:16.503 --> 03:18.738
so I thought I'd just
create something alive.

03:18.772 --> 03:20.339
Not why I'm here.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.742
It's, uh...

03:22.776 --> 03:24.544
<i>Science Monthly</i>
just contacted me

03:24.578 --> 03:27.180
about their Outstanding Women
of Science issue.

03:27.214 --> 03:28.981
Oh. Brennan again?

03:29.016 --> 03:31.851
No. Me.

03:32.886 --> 03:34.487
They want me this year.

03:34.521 --> 03:37.857
Oh, my God!
Cam, that's fantastic!

03:37.891 --> 03:39.759
Congratulations!

03:39.793 --> 03:42.228
I should be happy,
but I just feel uncomfortable.

03:43.664 --> 03:44.931
Brennan?

03:44.965 --> 03:48.501
Yeah. She can sometimes feel...

03:48.535 --> 03:50.503
I don't know how to say it.

03:50.537 --> 03:52.672
That all awards
should go to her?

03:52.706 --> 03:54.907
And I don't really care.

03:54.942 --> 03:56.542
I could just
tell the magazine no.

03:56.577 --> 03:58.444
Oh, no. Don't be ridiculous.

03:58.478 --> 04:00.846
This is...
this is a huge honor,

04:00.881 --> 04:02.915
and we're all going
to celebrate this,

04:02.950 --> 04:04.550
including Brennan.

04:04.585 --> 04:06.452
You have to
enjoy this.

04:06.486 --> 04:09.755
Smile. You deserve it.

04:15.028 --> 04:16.629
Aah. This will be easier.

04:16.663 --> 04:18.130
So, the pump
creates suction

04:18.165 --> 04:20.466
and delivers the contents
of the troughs into this

04:20.500 --> 04:22.535
sluice box,
which will separate liquid

04:22.569 --> 04:25.037
from particulates greater than
.03 millimeters.

04:25.072 --> 04:26.706
Quite the impressive
contrivance, Dr. Hodgins.

04:26.740 --> 04:28.407
Right? All right.

04:28.442 --> 04:29.575
Here we go.

04:32.012 --> 04:34.580
- Yeah!
- Oh!

04:34.615 --> 04:36.215
It appears to working.

04:36.250 --> 04:37.283
You know, this death

04:37.317 --> 04:38.751
might just be an accident.

04:38.785 --> 04:40.219
We had a farmhand

04:40.254 --> 04:41.520
who fell into the trough after

04:41.555 --> 04:43.256
drinking to excess.
The pigs must have

04:43.290 --> 04:45.491
thought he was delicious,
because there was nothing left.

04:45.525 --> 04:47.093
Well, considering
this person was

04:47.127 --> 04:49.662
dismembered, I would
rule out an accident.

04:49.696 --> 04:51.397
Yes.

04:53.867 --> 04:56.335
Oh. Ah.

04:56.370 --> 04:58.704
Dark brown hair.
Definitely human.

04:58.739 --> 05:00.439
Well, the greater

05:00.474 --> 05:02.575
sciatic notch indicates a male.

05:02.609 --> 05:05.011
The auricular surface indicates
an age range

05:05.045 --> 05:07.013
between 29 and 35.

05:07.047 --> 05:08.914
Huh. A central incisor.

05:08.949 --> 05:11.751
Not in any way connected
with the foot, of course.

05:11.785 --> 05:15.321
This spatula shape indicates
the victim was Caucasian.

05:15.355 --> 05:17.990
Told you it would work, huh?

05:20.894 --> 05:22.728
Well,

05:22.763 --> 05:24.330
it's not the filter.

05:24.364 --> 05:25.398
Can you hold that?
Yes.

05:25.432 --> 05:26.499
It's got to be

05:26.533 --> 05:28.768
the hose.

05:28.802 --> 05:30.403
Hey. Good news.

05:30.437 --> 05:32.638
Cam got a call from
<i>Science Monthly.</i>

05:32.673 --> 05:34.006
They announced this year's

05:34.041 --> 05:35.875
Outstanding Women
of Science award.

05:35.909 --> 05:37.243
Why did they call Cam?

05:37.277 --> 05:38.757
Why didn't they just
call me directly?

05:40.113 --> 05:42.948
Because Cam is getting
the award, sweetie.

05:42.983 --> 05:44.784
Wow!

05:44.818 --> 05:47.153
That's great.
Yes, I'm very happy for her.

05:47.187 --> 05:49.689
And you're happy
for her, too, Brennan.

05:49.723 --> 05:51.357
Very happy.

05:51.391 --> 05:52.992
Because she's your friend.

05:53.026 --> 05:54.760
Yes.

05:54.795 --> 05:57.830
Just the-the descriptor
is "outstanding."

05:57.864 --> 06:00.599
All right, we're all good to go.

06:00.634 --> 06:01.867
You know, <i>Science Monthly</i> is

06:01.902 --> 06:04.370
an exceptional mag...
Oh! My.

06:06.673 --> 06:07.907
Don't move,

06:07.941 --> 06:08.908
Dr. Filmore.

06:08.942 --> 06:10.343
You're covered in evidence.

06:10.377 --> 06:11.944
It's no problem.

06:11.978 --> 06:14.146
Just like being
back on the farm.

06:15.349 --> 06:16.849
Oh, here's a piece...

06:16.883 --> 06:19.151

A foot!

A foot is not necessarily

07:01.250 --> 07:03.851
the solution
to this forensic puzzle.

07:03.886 --> 07:05.553
I see you haven't
lost your conviction

07:05.587 --> 07:07.088
that you have
all the answers.

07:07.122 --> 07:10.358
Well, I am outstanding

07:10.392 --> 07:11.959
I assume that is why

07:11.994 --> 07:14.395
your government wanted
you to observe me.

07:16.865 --> 07:18.800
What are you
writing now?

07:18.834 --> 07:21.636
Oh, just an observation
that Americans are hubristic,

07:21.670 --> 07:23.604
and Canadians must deal
with this challenge

07:23.639 --> 07:24.939
in future cooperative ventures.

07:24.973 --> 07:27.709
Facts are not
hubris, Dr. Filmore.

07:28.495 --> 07:32.231
The left side of the frontal
bone, including the supraorbital

07:32.265 --> 07:34.333
foramen, as well as the maxilla,

07:34.367 --> 07:36.001
and the right zygomatic
are all missing.

07:36.036 --> 07:39.104
Facial reconstruction would
prove difficult for Angela.

07:39.139 --> 07:41.941
It appears there's a fracture
on the occipital,

07:41.975 --> 07:44.276
and avulsion fractures
on the left mastoid process.

07:44.311 --> 07:46.712
Confirming that
a hit and tear

07:46.746 --> 07:49.081
from the occipital
to the mastoid

07:49.115 --> 07:51.217
as a possible
cause of death.

07:51.251 --> 07:53.819
Hey. So, the hair sample
carried traces

07:53.854 --> 07:56.422
of beeswax and hempseed oil.

07:56.456 --> 07:58.824
Think our victim had dreadlocks.
Victim had blonde hair.

07:58.859 --> 08:01.327
That dark brown hair
could belong to the killer.

08:01.361 --> 08:02.728
All right, well,

08:02.762 --> 08:04.897
Cam's running a DNA
on both samples,

08:04.931 --> 08:07.233
but I also found traces
of chestnuts

08:07.267 --> 08:09.101
imbedded on
the victim's clothing.

08:09.135 --> 08:10.569
You know,

08:10.604 --> 08:12.638
at our farm,
when the pigs wouldn't eat,

08:12.672 --> 08:15.474
my father used to sweeten
the slop with chestnuts.

08:15.509 --> 08:18.444
So it's possible the killer
knew how to get the pigs

08:18.478 --> 08:20.179
to devour the victim.

08:20.213 --> 08:21.914
Yes.

08:21.948 --> 08:24.283
<i>Hey, Sweets,</i>

08:24.317 --> 08:26.252
got the DNA results
from the hair the squints found

08:26.286 --> 08:27.686
in the pig slop.

08:27.721 --> 08:29.088
Jarrick Henry.

08:29.122 --> 08:31.590
Who?
Jarrick Henry.

08:31.625 --> 08:34.360
Oh, right.
He's the guy who fed

08:34.394 --> 08:36.729
his victim to pigs,
right? Nice fella.

08:36.763 --> 08:38.831
Yeah, and with no body,
the lawyer got an acquittal.

08:38.865 --> 08:40.900
Didn't think
he'd pull that M.O. twice.

08:40.933 --> 08:43.102
You mean feed another
victim to pigs?

08:43.135 --> 08:44.603
He's a high-risk
repeat offender.

08:44.638 --> 08:46.105
He got away with it once.

08:46.139 --> 08:47.806
Probably figured he could
get away with it again.

08:47.841 --> 08:50.042
<i>You felt the honor</i>

08:50.076 --> 08:51.777
from <i>Science Monthly</i>
should go to you, eh?

08:51.811 --> 08:54.013
It's called "Outstanding
Women of Science."

08:54.047 --> 08:56.382
I have the utmost
respect for Dr. Saroyan.

08:56.416 --> 09:00.819
I can only surmise the editorial
staff consists of laymen.

09:00.854 --> 09:03.556
You know, in Canada,
we have a saying.

09:03.590 --> 09:05.491
"Wait your turn.

09:05.525 --> 09:07.226
"If you are truly deserving,

09:07.260 --> 09:09.094
an honor will eventually
come to you."

09:09.129 --> 09:12.298
That's why I don't
live in Canada.

09:12.332 --> 09:13.732
There are striations
that indicate

09:13.767 --> 09:15.134
a reciprocating saw was used

09:15.168 --> 09:16.969
to sever the head of the femur.

09:17.003 --> 09:18.537
And here,

09:18.572 --> 09:20.039
the same striations.

09:20.073 --> 09:21.473
There are false-start

09:21.508 --> 09:22.808
kerf marks on this radius.

09:22.842 --> 09:25.044
The blade broke.
And here,

09:25.078 --> 09:27.246
the striations
from the new blade.

09:27.280 --> 09:29.081
So the killer used
a reciprocating saw

09:29.115 --> 09:30.482
to cut up the body.

09:30.517 --> 09:31.817
You know, that moment there

09:31.851 --> 09:33.519
where we were working together
seamlessly

09:33.553 --> 09:35.220
in true harmony
and cooperation--

09:35.255 --> 09:38.524
it was... almost Canadian.

09:38.558 --> 09:41.827
You should write <i>that</i>
in your little book.

09:45.098 --> 09:47.566
<i>We found the saw</i>

09:47.601 --> 09:50.202
in your garage-- the one
you used to cut up the victim.

09:50.236 --> 09:52.504
Ballistic fingerprinting for
a saw blade? I don't think so.

09:52.539 --> 09:55.341
You also broke the blade
when you were cutting him up,

09:55.375 --> 09:57.409
smart guy.
See, that <i>does</i>

09:57.444 --> 09:59.078
leave a fingerprint on the bone.

09:59.112 --> 10:01.814
Look, okay, I'm being set up,
all right?

10:01.848 --> 10:05.117
Somebody tossed a dead guy
over the wall into my backyard.

10:05.151 --> 10:07.086
I didn't even know him.

10:07.120 --> 10:08.887
I'm confused.
Why didn't you call the cops

10:08.922 --> 10:10.322
when this dead body
showed up?

10:10.357 --> 10:12.124
Come on, man.
If I reported him to the cops,

10:12.158 --> 10:13.926
I'd be their number one suspect.
No, no, no, no, no.

10:13.960 --> 10:16.729
<i>Now</i> you're
the number one suspect.

10:16.763 --> 10:18.263
We have your DNA
on the victim.

10:18.298 --> 10:19.865
We also got you
for illegal disposal

10:19.899 --> 10:22.234
of human remains...
I didn't kill him.

10:22.268 --> 10:23.669
It's the dreads, baby.

10:23.703 --> 10:24.903
You're shedding
like a husky in the summer.

10:24.938 --> 10:26.639
You got away
with it last time.

10:26.673 --> 10:28.040
You're not getting away
with it this time.

10:28.074 --> 10:29.341
Wait, wait, wait.
You never mentioned

10:29.376 --> 10:30.743
the name of the dead guy.

10:33.146 --> 10:35.214
And I'm thinking
that's 'cause you don't know.

10:35.248 --> 10:37.549
Yeah.

10:37.584 --> 10:39.051
I got that right.

10:39.085 --> 10:41.020
Listen, all right,
I didn't kill him.

10:41.054 --> 10:43.622
All I did was feed
his body to the pigs.

10:43.657 --> 10:46.625
But I saw his face
before those pigs ate it.

10:46.660 --> 10:49.294
I can get you
a description.

10:51.598 --> 10:53.465
So...

10:53.500 --> 10:56.368
you ready to deal, G-Man?

11:01.107 --> 11:03.709
So, labs came back negative--
there was no blood found

11:03.743 --> 11:05.678
in Jarrick's trunk.
Well, he was meticulous.

11:05.712 --> 11:07.513
He was careful not to
bleach the saw blades,

11:07.547 --> 11:09.187
so he probably used
plastic sheets, right?

11:09.215 --> 11:11.583
No. Guy-- he's got no motive.
Forget him, okay?

11:11.618 --> 11:13.786
But Angela got an I.D.

11:13.820 --> 11:16.121
based on Jarrick Henry's
description.

11:16.156 --> 11:17.623
Oh, my God.

11:17.657 --> 11:19.992
You know him?
That's Albert Magnuson.

11:20.026 --> 11:21.393
The chess guy?

11:21.428 --> 11:23.262
Anyone who knows chess
knows Albert Magnuson.

11:23.296 --> 11:25.564
I used to be a serious
chess player, till college.

11:25.598 --> 11:28.233
Then I became a little obsessed,
had to give it up.

11:28.268 --> 11:31.103
But Albert's a genius,
brilliant.

11:31.137 --> 11:32.905
Turns out, Magnuson was
bringing in some serious cash.

11:32.939 --> 11:34.807
Angela found out
this information.

11:34.841 --> 11:36.709
Check out
the Web site here, huh?

11:36.743 --> 11:38.143
Your chess champion--

11:38.178 --> 11:40.446
he was bringing in
some serious merchandise.

11:40.480 --> 11:42.114
And there's some big
companies thought they could

11:42.148 --> 11:43.315
cash in if chess

11:43.349 --> 11:44.483
made it into the Olympics.

11:44.517 --> 11:46.251
They were buying the master.
Yeah.

11:46.286 --> 11:48.654
But all the names
and likeness of Albert Magnuson,

11:48.688 --> 11:50.889
all the merchandizing
and the sponsorship--

11:50.924 --> 11:53.625
that just goes
to Levitt Holdings.

11:53.660 --> 11:55.027
All right, so?

11:55.061 --> 11:57.563
There's only one chief officer

11:57.597 --> 12:00.299
of Levitt Holdings--
Suzanne Levitt.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.735
Oh, and with Magnuson gone, she
gets to keep all of his money.

12:02.769 --> 12:05.537
Right. I'm bringing her in.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.567
I can't believe this.

12:10.602 --> 12:12.808
Who would
murder Albert?

12:13.109 --> 12:15.182
Well, that's what
we're trying to find out.

12:15.183 --> 12:16.701
When was the last time
you saw him?

12:16.702 --> 12:18.135
Two days ago.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.171
We had lunch,
then he went to the chess club,

12:20.205 --> 12:22.106
and I-I didn't
see him after that.

12:22.140 --> 12:23.507
Your relationship with Albert

12:23.542 --> 12:25.509
wasn't just business
though, was it?

12:25.544 --> 12:28.612
He lived with me
and my son Tim.

12:28.647 --> 12:30.681
We were going to be married.

12:30.716 --> 12:33.918
In going over his life, we've
red-flagged a couple of issues

12:33.952 --> 12:35.619
regarding his finances;
you controlled

12:35.654 --> 12:37.822
all of the finances, right?
All of it.

12:37.856 --> 12:40.157
Well, all Albert wanted to do
was play chess.

12:40.192 --> 12:42.326
You're saying it was
out of concern for Albert

12:42.360 --> 12:44.361
that you controlled
all of his money?

12:44.396 --> 12:46.297
I didn't kill Albert.

12:46.331 --> 12:48.065
I loved him.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.034
And you made him
all of his money.

12:50.068 --> 12:51.235
Right. Magnuson
chess boards,

12:51.269 --> 12:53.904
TV appearances,
chess retreats...

12:53.939 --> 12:55.573
I had a background
in marketing;

12:55.607 --> 12:57.341
why shouldn't Albert
capitalize on his talent?

12:57.375 --> 12:58.876
And where were you
two nights ago?

12:58.910 --> 13:01.579
Home. Alone.

13:01.613 --> 13:03.814
And unless my cat can talk,

13:03.849 --> 13:05.783
I have no alibi.

13:05.817 --> 13:08.085
But you should really be talking
to Albert's ex-wife.

13:08.120 --> 13:09.854
She hated him.

13:09.888 --> 13:12.490
She burned down his apartment.

13:15.761 --> 13:18.395
<i>So, Magnuson's ex-wife Ingrid</i>

13:18.430 --> 13:20.865
is a member
of the Dutch Reformed Church.

13:20.899 --> 13:23.400
He wasn't; that caused
the couple to drift apart.

13:23.435 --> 13:25.703
Well, it's a very
strict religious sect.

13:25.737 --> 13:28.272
Right. Well, you know, she was
here on a visitor's visa.

13:28.306 --> 13:31.142
It expired and...
it was never surrendered.

13:31.176 --> 13:33.744
She's living under the radar;
she'll be hard to find.

13:33.779 --> 13:35.946
We'll find her.
We will find her.

13:35.981 --> 13:39.016
Booth, do you think
I'm being small-minded

13:39.050 --> 13:41.819
about Cam getting
the award and not me?

13:41.853 --> 13:43.788
Yes.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.089
What?

13:45.123 --> 13:46.323
You might want another answer,

13:46.358 --> 13:47.825
but I can't give that to you.

13:47.859 --> 13:50.261
But I'm clearly
the best scientist.

13:50.295 --> 13:52.930
And are you a worse scientist
because Cam's getting the award?

13:52.964 --> 13:54.331
Of course not.
See?

13:54.366 --> 13:55.666
Yeah. So you're just being petty

13:55.700 --> 13:56.934
because you want to win.

13:56.968 --> 13:59.303
I thought you would
take my side.

13:59.337 --> 14:01.105
I am on your side, okay?

14:01.139 --> 14:02.873
I'm on your better side.

14:02.908 --> 14:03.974
Huh?

14:04.009 --> 14:05.810
Much better side.
Oh, hey.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.077
Hey, guys.
Yeah.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.345
So, I called
the Mayfair Chess Club

14:08.380 --> 14:09.713
where Magnuson was last seen.

14:09.748 --> 14:11.982
I know some people there
from my chess days.

14:12.017 --> 14:15.119
Apparently, Magnuson had a lot
of enemies in the chess club.

14:15.153 --> 14:18.255
You think that the killer
could be a chess player?

14:18.290 --> 14:19.824
Yeah, I think
it's very possible.

14:19.858 --> 14:22.059
The killer did use Jarrick
to dispose of the body,

14:22.093 --> 14:24.261
basically sacrificing him
like a chess piece, right?

14:24.296 --> 14:26.630
There's a strong connection
between chess and the logic

14:26.665 --> 14:29.133
and forethought needed
to plan and execute a murder.

14:29.167 --> 14:30.734
Look, I'll tell you what,
why don't you go

14:30.769 --> 14:32.469
to the chess club
and see what you can dig up.

14:32.504 --> 14:34.405
So you're saying that
I'm the lead on the case?

14:34.439 --> 14:36.807
No. You're the...
chess nerd on the case.

14:36.842 --> 14:39.577
Lead chess nerd--
good enough for me.

14:41.000 --> 14:47.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:48.186 --> 14:49.854
Hey.

14:49.888 --> 14:52.089
Guess I shouldn't
be surprised to see you here.

14:52.123 --> 14:53.991
Dr. Sweets,
this is my son Tim.

14:54.025 --> 14:57.161
Y-You're investigating
Albert's murder, aren't you?

14:57.195 --> 14:59.830
Do me a favor,
keep it on the down low.

14:59.865 --> 15:02.299
- Sure.
- I have to go, Tim.

15:02.334 --> 15:03.701
Call me when you're done?

15:03.735 --> 15:05.369
Yeah.

15:10.075 --> 15:12.042
You don't drive?

15:12.077 --> 15:14.945
Uh, Mom's been trying
to spend more time with me.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.614
Especially since... you know.

15:16.648 --> 15:17.615
Mm-hmm.

15:17.649 --> 15:19.083
Were you and Albert close?

15:19.117 --> 15:20.851
My mom met Albert through me.

15:20.886 --> 15:22.853
He was kind of my mentor here.

15:22.888 --> 15:25.089
Like-like a second father to me.

15:25.123 --> 15:26.290
Right.

15:26.324 --> 15:27.491
Sweets!

15:27.525 --> 15:29.493
Hey, Romanov,
good to see you.

15:29.527 --> 15:31.395
You have been
conspicuously absent

15:31.429 --> 15:33.330
for the past decade.

15:33.365 --> 15:35.733
Whoa, Sweets! Hi, Lance!
Hey, guys.

15:37.335 --> 15:39.970
These-these guys know you?

15:40.005 --> 15:42.606
Ten years ago, Sweets was one
of the youngest chess masters

15:42.641 --> 15:43.874
in the federation.

15:43.909 --> 15:44.775
Brilliant.

15:44.809 --> 15:45.809
Yeah, I'm probably

15:45.844 --> 15:47.111
very rusty at this point.

15:47.145 --> 15:48.646
Ah, I think not.

15:48.680 --> 15:50.547
Remember the old Russian saying:

15:50.582 --> 15:52.616
"You cannot drink
your glass away."

15:52.651 --> 15:54.318
I look forward
to sitting

15:54.352 --> 15:56.120
opposite you again, Sweets.

15:56.154 --> 15:57.554
You want to
show me around?

15:57.589 --> 15:59.089
Sure.

15:59.124 --> 16:01.292
Um...

16:14.139 --> 16:15.339
You <i>are</i> good.

16:15.373 --> 16:17.041
Yeah, good and rusty.

16:17.075 --> 16:20.010
I'd like to be
as rusty as you are.

16:20.045 --> 16:21.745
Sorry about Magnuson, son.

16:21.780 --> 16:23.881
I hope he didn't misinterpret me
the last time we spoke.

16:23.915 --> 16:27.584
No, sir, it was very clear
how you felt.

16:27.619 --> 16:29.153
Seems like a lot
of people here

16:29.187 --> 16:30.654
had an issue with Mr. Magnuson.

16:30.689 --> 16:31.956
Sweets, right?

16:31.990 --> 16:34.024
Dimitri told me about you.

16:34.059 --> 16:35.559
Magnuson was

16:35.593 --> 16:37.094
a good player.

16:37.128 --> 16:38.495
Great, even.

16:38.530 --> 16:39.763
But?

16:39.798 --> 16:41.231
But nothing.

16:41.266 --> 16:42.566
Mr. Wakefield
used to be my teacher.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.269
And then you started
studying with Albert.

16:45.303 --> 16:46.804
Before you jump
to ugly conclusions,

16:46.838 --> 16:49.340
I never liked Albert, true,
but I was with Tim

16:49.374 --> 16:50.541
when it happened.

16:50.575 --> 16:52.209
At the deli.

16:52.243 --> 16:54.745
I wasn't accusing you
of anything.

16:54.779 --> 16:57.414
I'm sorry for your loss, Tim.

16:57.449 --> 16:59.316
If you need
my help again,

16:59.351 --> 17:01.552
just let me know.

17:09.327 --> 17:11.729
Magnuson was last
seen headed here.

17:11.762 --> 17:13.396
His parking's spot
somewhere over there.

17:13.431 --> 17:15.598
Where, in the dark?

17:17.635 --> 17:19.536
Lights are broken.

17:19.570 --> 17:20.838
Any suspects

17:20.872 --> 17:22.473
at the chess club?
Well,

17:22.507 --> 17:24.474
you know, like a lot
of brilliant people,

17:24.509 --> 17:27.744
Magnuson had a huge ego,
left little room for others.

17:27.779 --> 17:31.782
Ah. So no one was, uh,
mourning his loss.

17:31.816 --> 17:33.917
Oh... look at that.

17:33.952 --> 17:36.553
Broken glass.

17:36.588 --> 17:39.089
Ah.

17:39.124 --> 17:40.891
Light's broken.

17:40.925 --> 17:42.559
Hold up.

17:42.594 --> 17:44.461
Broken lights
all over the place.

17:44.496 --> 17:47.031
A good place
for an ambush.

17:47.065 --> 17:50.367
Lot of water on the ground here;
must be a busted pipe.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.835
Yep, there it is.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.510
Security camera--
hopefully it's infrared.

17:53.538 --> 17:54.972
Could be our lucky day.

17:55.006 --> 17:56.573
Get some
footage off it.

17:56.608 --> 17:59.243
Found his parking spot.

17:59.277 --> 18:02.446
Look at that.

18:02.480 --> 18:04.381
Blood.

18:04.416 --> 18:07.117
This is where Magnuson
was killed.

18:12.765 --> 18:14.832
I've got more blood

18:14.867 --> 18:16.934
over here.
Impact hit?

18:16.969 --> 18:18.436
Probably.

18:18.470 --> 18:20.905
Spatter pattern looks
like someone may have

18:20.939 --> 18:24.409
smashed the victim's head
against the wall.

18:24.443 --> 18:26.044
This may match
the skull fractures

18:26.078 --> 18:27.278
we found on the occipital.

18:27.312 --> 18:28.813
Looks like
water evaporated,

18:28.847 --> 18:30.748
- leaving rock salt.
- Excuse me, sir.

18:30.783 --> 18:32.283
Yeah?
I'm wondering how long

18:32.317 --> 18:34.118
you're gonna be tying up
our parking garage?

18:34.153 --> 18:35.553
As long as it takes, I'm afraid.

18:35.587 --> 18:37.488
Some of our members had
to park in the street,

18:37.523 --> 18:39.223
and my car is
blocked in over there.

18:39.258 --> 18:41.926
Yeah, murder's such
an inconvenience, right?

18:48.133 --> 18:50.268
<i>The hard drive</i>

18:50.302 --> 18:53.237
from the surveillance camera
is totally fried.

18:53.272 --> 18:54.872
Our killer was pretty thorough.

18:54.907 --> 18:57.842
I did manage to get the time
that it was fried though.

18:57.876 --> 19:01.245
2:30 a.m. on the night
that Magnuson was murdered.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.014
That syncs up
with Jarrick Henry's story.

19:03.048 --> 19:06.717
He said the body was dumped
at his place at 3:30 a.m.

19:06.752 --> 19:08.853
I'll tell Booth.

19:10.355 --> 19:13.925
I... called...
<i>Science Monthly.</i>

19:13.959 --> 19:16.794
Oh. You didn't
turn them down, did you?

19:16.829 --> 19:19.097
Not exactly.
But I did tell them

19:19.131 --> 19:22.500
that if they didn't honor
you and Dr. Brennan as well,

19:22.534 --> 19:24.302
that I couldn't
accept the award.

19:24.336 --> 19:27.338
You... you told
them to honor <i>me?</i>

19:28.507 --> 19:32.477
Oh, my gosh,
you're so sweet.

19:32.511 --> 19:34.045
Hey, we're nothing
without each other, Angela--

19:34.079 --> 19:36.180
that's a fact.
You're amazing.

19:36.215 --> 19:38.382
Wait till
I tell Brennan.

19:38.417 --> 19:42.286
I'd like to tell her myself--
if this all works out.

20:01.907 --> 20:02.940
Mate.

20:02.975 --> 20:04.308
Bravo.

20:04.343 --> 20:06.844
You have not lost
your edge, Mr. Sweets.

20:06.879 --> 20:09.046
Thank you, Dimitri.
It's my pleasure.

20:10.282 --> 20:13.551
Bishop's pair checkmate--
that is so cool.

20:13.585 --> 20:15.820
Yeah, I saw
Kasparov do that.

20:15.854 --> 20:18.523
Study the greats--
that's what Magnuson taught me.

20:18.557 --> 20:20.258
Well played.

20:20.292 --> 20:21.259
Well played.

20:21.293 --> 20:22.527
He's a master.

20:22.561 --> 20:24.128
Uh, this is An Ni.

20:24.163 --> 20:25.997
It's nice to
meet you, Annie.

20:26.031 --> 20:27.932
Not Annie. An Ni.

20:27.966 --> 20:30.501
An, first name; Ni, last.

20:30.536 --> 20:31.769
You guys'll
have to excuse me.

20:31.803 --> 20:33.638
I have a game starting.

20:33.672 --> 20:35.406
Is that you up
there, Annie--

20:35.440 --> 20:36.440
uh, An... An...

20:36.475 --> 20:37.508
Ni.
Ni.

20:37.543 --> 20:38.609
Yes.

20:39.545 --> 20:41.679
I had a good year.

20:41.713 --> 20:43.314
They let me hold the plaque.

20:43.348 --> 20:44.916
When was the
picture taken?

20:44.950 --> 20:46.784
A month or so ago,

20:46.818 --> 20:49.687
I think-- I'm not very good with time.
Oh.

20:49.721 --> 20:51.088
What happened
to Magnuson's hand there?

20:51.123 --> 20:52.557
Olin.

20:52.591 --> 20:56.060
Tiffin Olin.
He broke it with a clock timer.

20:56.094 --> 20:58.062
Is Olin in the photo?

20:58.096 --> 21:00.598
No. He got kicked out
of the club for that.

21:00.632 --> 21:01.966
Mm.

21:02.935 --> 21:05.203
That's him.

21:06.505 --> 21:08.839
When did you last see Olin?

21:08.874 --> 21:10.508
You ask so many questions,
curious guy.

21:11.810 --> 21:13.477
Weeks ago.

21:13.512 --> 21:15.947
Olin plays in the park now.

21:37.669 --> 21:39.370
Tiffin Olin.

21:39.404 --> 21:40.805
FBI. Special Agent
Seeley Booth.

21:40.839 --> 21:42.540
Need to ask you
a few questions

21:42.574 --> 21:43.841
about Albert Magnuson.
I'm playing.

21:43.875 --> 21:45.076
When I finish these games.

21:45.110 --> 21:46.944
Take a break.

21:46.979 --> 21:49.413
Albert Magnuson was murdered.

21:49.448 --> 21:51.449
We know you broke
his hand in the past.

21:51.483 --> 21:52.683
Why'd you break his hand?

21:52.718 --> 21:54.352
Oh, God.

21:54.386 --> 21:56.254
Oh, no.
Whoa, easy, easy!

21:56.288 --> 21:57.989
Hold it right there.

21:58.023 --> 21:59.123
Nice and slow.

21:59.157 --> 22:01.993
Don't do
anything stupid.

22:02.027 --> 22:05.463
On the table.

22:05.497 --> 22:06.931
Easy.

22:06.965 --> 22:08.165
What is that?

22:08.200 --> 22:09.533
A sandwich?

22:09.568 --> 22:10.968
When I get stressed, I eat.

22:11.003 --> 22:12.069
You're accusing me
of killing Albert,

22:12.104 --> 22:14.071
so I'm stressed, I want to eat.

22:14.106 --> 22:16.307
Okay, listen, you can
eat after we talk.

22:16.341 --> 22:17.975
Magnuson was crazy.

22:18.010 --> 22:21.145
He told everybody that my
cell phone gave off vibrations

22:21.179 --> 22:24.382
in Morse code a-and
that's how I was winning.

22:24.416 --> 22:25.583
Well, was it?

22:25.617 --> 22:27.318
Are <i>you</i> crazy?

22:27.352 --> 22:30.354
He just wanted me
out of the tournament

22:30.389 --> 22:32.223
because I was his only
serious competition.

22:32.257 --> 22:34.158
Where were you three nights ago?

22:35.360 --> 22:36.894
It's embarrassing.

22:36.928 --> 22:39.530
More embarrassing than
sitting in an FBI holding cell?

22:41.400 --> 22:42.667
I'm lonely.

22:42.701 --> 22:43.734
Okay.

22:43.769 --> 22:45.336
I got arrested
for propositioning

22:45.370 --> 22:48.339
a prostitute
who turned out to be a cop.

22:48.373 --> 22:50.074
I spent the night in jail.

22:50.108 --> 22:51.375
I-I'm sure you can
verify that.

22:51.410 --> 22:52.877
Booth.

22:52.911 --> 22:55.246
I found Magnuson's
ex-wife Ingrid

22:55.280 --> 22:56.747
through her church.

22:56.782 --> 22:59.450
She's in McLean, Virginia,

22:59.484 --> 23:01.585
working as a nanny
for a church family

23:01.620 --> 23:03.421
under her maiden name...

23:03.455 --> 23:06.057
Ingrid Vanderlube.

23:06.091 --> 23:08.025
C-Can I have my sandwich now?

23:08.060 --> 23:09.560
Yeah, you can have
your sandwich.

23:09.594 --> 23:11.529
Okay, I'll go bring her in.

23:18.690 --> 23:21.725
<i>I thought my life</i>
<i>with Albert was good.</i>

23:21.759 --> 23:24.862
But getting those
pictures in the mail...

23:24.896 --> 23:26.663
was a real <i>wekroep.</i>

23:26.698 --> 23:27.865
I'm sor... A real what?

23:27.899 --> 23:29.266
Wake-up call.

23:29.300 --> 23:30.734
It's Dutch.

23:33.071 --> 23:34.404
Right.

23:34.439 --> 23:36.540
Wow... whoa.

23:38.176 --> 23:41.111
What was going on in those
photos was unnatural.

23:41.145 --> 23:42.412
Evil.

23:42.447 --> 23:44.414
And this is Albert and...

23:44.449 --> 23:45.983
The hellhag.

23:46.017 --> 23:47.451
Suzanne Levitt.

23:47.485 --> 23:49.586
She sent them.

23:49.621 --> 23:51.388
The hellhag.

23:51.422 --> 23:53.023
Right, you saw
these photos, and, uh,

23:53.057 --> 23:56.193
you got upset and you...
burned down his place.

23:56.227 --> 23:58.762
Albert betrayed me.

23:58.796 --> 24:01.765
He became an unholy apostate.

24:01.799 --> 24:03.433
A phallacist.

24:03.468 --> 24:05.802
Right, that sounds dirty.

24:05.837 --> 24:08.805
His apartment needed
to be cleansed by fire.

24:08.840 --> 24:09.907
Right.

24:09.941 --> 24:11.375
So you got off the grid.

24:11.409 --> 24:13.210
Yes.

24:13.244 --> 24:15.379
Earthly laws shouldn't apply
in that situation.

24:15.413 --> 24:17.714
All right, well,
you live on Earth, Ingrid,

24:17.749 --> 24:19.783
and those laws
do apply to you, so...

24:19.817 --> 24:21.184
Where were you
three nights ago?

24:21.219 --> 24:22.786
At the house where I work.

24:22.820 --> 24:25.122
The family was out,
but I was there.

24:25.156 --> 24:27.391
Okay.

24:27.425 --> 24:29.826
Please, d-don't tell
them about this.

24:29.861 --> 24:31.695
I need that job.

24:31.729 --> 24:34.131
Well, I wouldn't
get your hopes up.

24:34.165 --> 24:37.634
I mean, um, your visa's expired
and you burn down apartments.

24:45.109 --> 24:47.144
DNA confirmed
that the burned flesh

24:47.178 --> 24:49.713
found in the pig slop
<i>was</i> from the victim.

24:49.747 --> 24:52.482
And take a look at this.

24:55.286 --> 24:57.821
There are microblisters in the
stratified squamous epithelium

24:57.855 --> 25:00.357
and the external
horny layer.

25:00.391 --> 25:03.126
And enlarged vacuoles
within the epidermal cells.

25:03.161 --> 25:05.028
The cells are flattened.

25:05.063 --> 25:07.164
What part of the body
was this tissue taken from?

25:07.198 --> 25:08.465
The feet.

25:10.668 --> 25:12.302
Ah. Now, see,

25:12.337 --> 25:14.004
these phalanges may show signs

25:14.038 --> 25:15.639
of avulsion fractures
due to subluxation.

25:15.673 --> 25:18.508
You're right, but
it's not subluxation.

25:18.543 --> 25:20.978
There's a complete
separation there.

25:21.012 --> 25:24.314
I think I know what happened!

25:24.349 --> 25:26.016
This is wonderful to see.

25:26.050 --> 25:27.718
Note the capsular ligaments

25:27.752 --> 25:30.654
and coracoacromial ligaments
show signs of stretching

25:30.688 --> 25:32.222
and abnormal position.

25:32.256 --> 25:35.559
If you add these findings
to the stress fractures

25:35.593 --> 25:37.633
and numerous avulsion fractures...
We will find that

25:37.662 --> 25:41.632
the answer to how our victim
was killed came from the feet.

25:42.667 --> 25:44.968
The feet.

25:46.504 --> 25:48.705
My, my, my.

25:48.740 --> 25:52.542
I'm surprised to see such
a patriotic Canadian gloating,

25:52.577 --> 25:54.144
Dr. Filmore.

25:54.178 --> 25:55.646
You're absolutely right.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.447
I'm sorry.

26:00.318 --> 26:03.186
A negative note about a
Canadian, Dr. Filmore?

26:03.221 --> 26:04.788
Oh, yes.

26:04.822 --> 26:06.723
A report without negative
comments about a Canadian

26:06.758 --> 26:09.760
would be unacceptable in Canada.

26:15.099 --> 26:16.633
Excuse me.

26:16.668 --> 26:18.735
What's going
on in here?

26:18.770 --> 26:21.038
Well, let's see
if you're as good

26:21.072 --> 26:23.306
as you want us all to think
you are, Sweets.

26:23.341 --> 26:24.441
There were actually
people who...

26:24.475 --> 26:25.976
I have seniority.

26:26.010 --> 26:27.711
You take white.

26:27.745 --> 26:29.546
I won't need the advantage.

Okay.

28:26.764 --> 28:28.064
You know my game play.

28:28.099 --> 28:29.800
I've been watching you.

28:29.834 --> 28:32.335
And I looked up your old games
on the federation database,

28:32.370 --> 28:34.905
just like Albert taught me.

28:42.713 --> 28:45.048
Hey, Hodgins found
clamp marks

28:45.082 --> 28:48.151
in the 480-volt main
in the parking garage

28:48.186 --> 28:49.920
where the killer
tied into the panel

28:49.954 --> 28:51.254
and created his own circuit.

28:51.289 --> 28:52.856
Because of Dr. Filmore,

28:52.890 --> 28:55.792
we know the killer planned
to electrocute Magnuson

28:55.827 --> 28:57.227
as he got into his car.

28:57.261 --> 28:58.595
No accolades, please;
they embarrass me.

28:58.629 --> 29:00.430
That was merely
a statement of fact.

29:00.464 --> 29:02.899
Hmm. So, uh, how did the killer

29:02.934 --> 29:05.302
connect the circuit
to the victim?

29:05.336 --> 29:06.903
According to Hodgins,
the killer

29:06.938 --> 29:09.773
poured water and rock salt
onto the garage floor.

29:09.807 --> 29:12.375
Creating an extremely conductive
electrical environment.

29:12.410 --> 29:13.710
Uh, this should be

29:13.744 --> 29:17.047
an accurate reconstruction
of the murder.

29:17.081 --> 29:18.615
As Magnuson
returned to his car,

29:18.649 --> 29:22.185
the killer placed
the live end

29:22.220 --> 29:26.089
of the circuit into the water
and fried him.

29:26.123 --> 29:29.059
And the shock was so traumatic,
it literally blew

29:29.093 --> 29:30.961
the victim's toes off.
And created stress

29:30.995 --> 29:33.230
and avulsion fractures
throughout the body.

29:33.264 --> 29:35.065
And launched him into the wall

29:35.099 --> 29:37.400
where we found
the bloodstains.

29:37.435 --> 29:41.037
Breaking bones of his left hand
when it hit first.

29:41.072 --> 29:44.341
The surge of power fried the
surveillance camera hard drive.

29:44.375 --> 29:46.276
And blew out
the jelly jar lights.

29:46.310 --> 29:48.712
The only problem is
that none of our suspects

29:48.746 --> 29:50.614
could have been there
when this happened.

29:50.648 --> 29:53.149
Except the woman
he was going to marry.

30:01.792 --> 30:04.594
Well, you-you had me there.

30:04.629 --> 30:06.863
Why didn't you
sacrifice your queen?

30:06.898 --> 30:09.633
I didn't see it.

30:09.667 --> 30:12.402
I don't believe that
for a second.

30:12.436 --> 30:14.204
What's he doing?

30:14.238 --> 30:16.506
Make your move.

30:30.521 --> 30:31.588
You want to take a nap?

30:31.622 --> 30:34.057
No, I'm fine.

31:08.192 --> 31:10.493
You're playing
way above your rating.

31:10.528 --> 31:12.329
Magnuson wasn't your mentor.

31:13.397 --> 31:16.032
He thought he was.

31:19.203 --> 31:21.638
All right.

31:21.672 --> 31:24.908
All right.

31:29.947 --> 31:32.582
Checkmate.

31:35.019 --> 31:36.386
Wow, nice.

31:36.420 --> 31:37.988
He did it.

31:38.022 --> 31:40.190
Tim Levitt, you're under arrest
for the murder

31:40.224 --> 31:41.858
of Albert Magnuson.

31:46.301 --> 31:47.512
<i>You arrested this kid</i>

31:47.513 --> 31:49.113
'cause he beat you at chess?

31:49.148 --> 31:50.548
Listen, he could've won
much earlier in the game,

31:50.583 --> 31:52.317
but he refused
to sacrifice his queen.

31:52.351 --> 31:54.919
His queen? Okay, do you know
how crazy you sound right now?

31:54.954 --> 31:56.955
It's symbolic of Tim not wanting
to sacrifice his mother.

31:56.989 --> 31:58.089
The two of them are too close.

31:58.123 --> 31:59.324
Plus, he didn't yawn when I did.

31:59.358 --> 32:01.025
That's not gonna hold up
in court.

32:01.060 --> 32:02.894
It's a test for sociopaths.
A normal person,

32:02.928 --> 32:04.762
when they see someone yawn,
they yawn.

32:04.797 --> 32:06.998
Sociopaths don't
'cause they don't have empathy.

32:07.032 --> 32:09.334
The kid has an alibi. He was
at a deli, but his mother...

32:09.368 --> 32:10.602
The mother was going
to marry Magnuson.

32:10.636 --> 32:12.370
To Tim, he was being replaced.

32:12.404 --> 32:13.538
He's guilty, Booth.

32:13.572 --> 32:15.240
He's guilty; I know it.

32:20.346 --> 32:21.980
Fine. Let me go
talk to him.

32:22.014 --> 32:24.015
No, no, no, let me.
No.

32:24.049 --> 32:25.283
We got him for six hours
before we have

32:25.317 --> 32:26.217
to release him; let me at him.

32:26.252 --> 32:27.318
No. You're a shrink;

32:27.353 --> 32:28.353
I'm a trained interrogator.

32:28.387 --> 32:29.554
But this isn't

32:29.588 --> 32:31.289
a normal interrogation, is it?

32:31.323 --> 32:32.423
To Tim, this is chess.

32:32.458 --> 32:33.725
And every move he's made so far

32:33.759 --> 32:35.493
has been a brilliant

32:35.528 --> 32:37.695
and careful calculation.

32:39.732 --> 32:41.866
Okay, one shot.
That's it.

32:41.901 --> 32:43.735
If I see you going south
with this,

32:43.769 --> 32:45.937
or you're screwing it up, I'm
gonna pull you from the room.

32:45.971 --> 32:47.705
Great.

32:49.308 --> 32:51.242
It's been two hours.

32:51.277 --> 32:52.644
Why are you keeping me here?

32:52.678 --> 32:54.279
I haven't done anything wrong.

32:54.313 --> 32:55.680
Sit down, Tim.

32:55.714 --> 32:58.249
Let me tell you
what we know so far.

32:58.284 --> 33:01.119
Is that the killer?
He's so young.

33:01.153 --> 33:02.687
Yeah, and very smart.

33:02.721 --> 33:04.489
You dumped the body
at Jarrick's house

33:04.523 --> 33:06.558
because you knew he'd
get rid of it for you.

33:06.592 --> 33:09.360
You introduced me to An Ni
'cause you knew

33:09.395 --> 33:10.862
she'd lead us to Tiffin Olin.

33:10.896 --> 33:13.064
You've been playing us all

33:13.098 --> 33:14.766
from the beginning,
like we're your chess pieces.

33:14.800 --> 33:18.069
Dr. Sweets,
I didn't do anything like this.

33:18.103 --> 33:20.104
- Let me tell you what I think.
<i>- See, that's good.</i>

33:20.139 --> 33:21.606
He's staying in control,

33:21.640 --> 33:23.041
not letting him say
that he's innocent.

33:23.075 --> 33:24.542
Take his coat off;
it says that,

33:24.577 --> 33:26.144
you know what, he
ain't going anywhere.

33:26.178 --> 33:27.979
Dr. Sweets,

33:28.013 --> 33:29.814
I loved Albert.
I would never do any...

33:29.848 --> 33:31.316
You didn't love Albert.

33:31.350 --> 33:32.850
Nobody did.

33:32.885 --> 33:35.086
Even your mom said
that he was volatile

33:35.120 --> 33:36.754
and had a temper.

33:36.789 --> 33:38.289
People would say

33:38.324 --> 33:40.658
that you did the world a
favor by taking him out.

33:40.693 --> 33:42.760
What Sweets is saying is absurd.

33:42.795 --> 33:44.028
It's called developing themes.

33:44.063 --> 33:45.263
He's giving him
alternative versions

33:45.297 --> 33:47.131
of the crime
so he might admit to it.

33:47.166 --> 33:48.333
But it's not working.

33:48.367 --> 33:49.767
Well, of course it's not.

33:49.802 --> 33:51.603
I mean, if he was guilty,
he'd be leaning back.

33:51.637 --> 33:53.004
Oh, right.

33:53.038 --> 33:54.639
Because kinesiology suggests
that he'd maintain

33:54.673 --> 33:56.808
as much distance
from his accuser as possible.

33:56.842 --> 33:58.076
Fascinating.

33:58.110 --> 33:59.911
<i>So, I managed</i>

33:59.945 --> 34:01.346
to retrieve a
partial image

34:01.380 --> 34:03.781
from the surveillance
camera hard drive.

34:03.816 --> 34:05.116
Now, this is the moment

34:05.150 --> 34:07.151
when Magnuson
was electrocuted.

34:07.186 --> 34:09.120
Take a look at this.

34:09.154 --> 34:12.422
On the left is Magnuson,
and on the right is the killer.

34:12.458 --> 34:14.525
But look at the time stamp.

34:16.328 --> 34:18.329
He was killed two hours
earlier than we thought.

34:18.364 --> 34:20.398
Wait. But your analysis
of the hard drive showed

34:20.431 --> 34:22.266
it was fried at 2:30 a.m.

34:22.301 --> 34:24.034
Because there were
two power surges.

34:24.069 --> 34:27.438
There was one at 12:30,
which killed Magnuson,

34:27.473 --> 34:30.507
and another at 2:30 which fried
the surveillance hard drive.

34:30.542 --> 34:32.210
How did he cause
the second power surge

34:32.244 --> 34:34.145
when he was at the deli?
My guess:

34:34.179 --> 34:36.447
he isolated the circuit
for the surveillance camera,

34:36.482 --> 34:37.982
put it on a timer,

34:38.016 --> 34:39.684
and came back later
and removed the evidence.

34:39.717 --> 34:41.452
Tim has no alibi.

34:41.487 --> 34:42.887
Unfortunately,
this is not enough evidence

34:42.920 --> 34:44.322
for a conviction.

34:44.356 --> 34:45.857
We need a confession.

34:52.197 --> 34:55.132
I'd like some more water,
please.

34:55.167 --> 34:57.168
You've had
enough water, Tim.

34:57.202 --> 34:59.337
Setting that trap
to electrocute Albert--

34:59.371 --> 35:02.106
now, that required
a lot of expertise.

35:02.141 --> 35:03.941
You could have
killed yourself.

35:03.976 --> 35:05.476
Lucky for you,

35:05.511 --> 35:07.345
you took that electrical
engineering course in school.

35:07.379 --> 35:10.314
Mr. Wakefield worked
as an electrician for years.

35:10.349 --> 35:12.817
Maybe you should talk to him.

35:12.851 --> 35:14.552
<i>He's countering</i>

35:14.586 --> 35:15.953
every move Sweets makes.

35:15.988 --> 35:17.689
This <i>is</i> like chess.

35:17.723 --> 35:19.190
He's playing this perfectly.

35:19.224 --> 35:21.225
Your mom had a couple of
boyfriends before Albert,

35:21.260 --> 35:23.327
and those ended
badly, too, huh?

35:23.362 --> 35:25.897
Too? My mom
and Albert were happy.

35:25.931 --> 35:29.867
His temper, the fighting,
his wanting you to move out.

35:29.902 --> 35:31.235
He didn't want that.

35:31.270 --> 35:32.937
We were close, all of us.

35:32.971 --> 35:34.539
That's not
what your mother said.

35:38.010 --> 35:40.311
You're really reaching,
Dr. Sweets.

35:40.345 --> 35:41.879
And you're leaning back, Tim.

35:41.914 --> 35:43.414
If I could hit the
timer now, I would.

35:43.449 --> 35:45.149
Boom. That was good.

35:45.184 --> 35:46.784
You're the only one
that your mother

35:46.819 --> 35:48.319
could count on, right?

35:48.353 --> 35:51.789
You're the only one
that can make her happy.

35:51.824 --> 35:54.192
Albert made her happy.

35:54.226 --> 35:55.727
Albert made...? Okay.

35:55.761 --> 35:58.329
Well, taking these photos
of Albert and your mom

35:58.363 --> 36:01.299
and sending them to his ex-wife
Ingrid-- that sounds like

36:01.333 --> 36:02.900
a happy family, right?

36:02.935 --> 36:04.502
I didn't take any photos,
Dr. Sweets.

36:04.536 --> 36:06.404
You would do anything
to protect your mom.

36:06.438 --> 36:08.239
That's why you refused
to sacrifice your queen.

36:08.273 --> 36:10.074
That's why you killed Albert,
isn't it?

36:10.109 --> 36:12.143
Sweets' logic
is quite manipulative

36:12.177 --> 36:14.779
and very impressive.

36:14.813 --> 36:17.582
You're inventing a motive based
off of a chess game we played?

36:17.616 --> 36:19.517
Really, Dr. Sweets?

36:19.551 --> 36:21.886
I thought
you were smarter than that.

36:21.920 --> 36:23.988
Game play mirrors
the personality of the player.

36:24.022 --> 36:26.057
Didn't Albert teach you that?

36:26.091 --> 36:28.126
All I can say is the same thing
I've been saying

36:28.160 --> 36:29.527
for the last three hours.

36:29.561 --> 36:31.529
I did not kill Albert Magnuson.

36:31.563 --> 36:33.931
Well, I'd advise you to
call your lawyer, Tim.

36:33.966 --> 36:36.934
Why? I haven't done
anything wrong.

36:38.170 --> 36:40.138
I really would like
that water now,

36:40.172 --> 36:41.572
please, if that's all right.

36:44.810 --> 36:46.811
I just need one more shot
with him.

36:46.845 --> 36:49.113
Trust me, Sweets,
this is gonna work, okay?

36:49.148 --> 36:51.516
Booth is right. It's
like the queen sacrifice

36:51.550 --> 36:53.934
Marshall used against
Levitsky in 1912.

36:53.959 --> 36:54.986
What?

36:54.987 --> 36:56.854
He wouldn't see that coming.
How'd you know about that?

36:56.889 --> 36:58.589
I play, too.
Not like you, of course.

36:58.624 --> 36:59.957
I've been trying

36:59.992 --> 37:01.659
to teach Booth, but
he keeps referring

37:01.693 --> 37:03.427
to the knights as "horsies."

37:03.462 --> 37:04.896
That's great.
Can we just move this along?

37:04.930 --> 37:06.297
Okay, chess is
a one-on-one game,

37:06.331 --> 37:08.499
but in a real war,
you need a platoon,

37:08.534 --> 37:10.168
and that's what
we are right now, okay?

37:10.202 --> 37:11.702
So let's move out.

37:18.076 --> 37:19.677
I'd like to apologize, Tim.

37:19.711 --> 37:21.212
You're free to go.

37:21.246 --> 37:22.547
We found the killer.

37:22.581 --> 37:24.682
What?

37:24.716 --> 37:28.286
I was mistaken,
and I'd like to offer my help,

37:28.320 --> 37:30.955
because this could be
very difficult for you.

37:30.989 --> 37:33.257
I don't understand.

37:33.292 --> 37:35.860
Your mother had access to your
electrical engineering books.

37:35.894 --> 37:37.595
That doesn't mean anything.

37:37.629 --> 37:39.497
There's more, Tim.

37:39.531 --> 37:42.266
We have a partial DNA match from
the trunk of the victim's car.

37:42.301 --> 37:43.901
It's either yours or your mom's.

37:43.936 --> 37:45.703
You have an alibi,
and she doesn't.

37:45.737 --> 37:47.705
My mom wouldn't do that.

37:47.739 --> 37:48.873
This is clearly painful for you.

37:48.907 --> 37:50.141
I-I misunderstood

37:50.175 --> 37:52.109
your relationship
with your mother.

37:52.144 --> 37:54.278
She was the one who'd do
anything to protect you.

37:54.313 --> 37:56.781
She felt that Albert
was taking you away from her.

37:56.815 --> 37:58.482
No, you've got it all wrong.

37:58.517 --> 37:59.584
No, Tim.

37:59.618 --> 38:01.385
She confessed.

38:01.420 --> 38:03.855
Confessed?

38:06.725 --> 38:07.892
Tim! Timmy!

38:07.926 --> 38:09.327
Mom.
Tim, call a lawyer.

38:09.361 --> 38:11.429
Hold him
back, Sweets.

38:11.463 --> 38:12.997
Timmy...
Hold him back! Hold him back!

38:13.031 --> 38:14.265
Call me a lawyer!

38:14.299 --> 38:15.433
You-you can't do this.

38:15.467 --> 38:17.401
It wasn't her!
I did it!

38:17.436 --> 38:20.605
I set a timer.
That's how I got my alibi.

38:20.639 --> 38:22.240
It wasn't her!

38:22.274 --> 38:24.275
I killed Albert!

38:24.309 --> 38:25.676
You did what?

38:25.711 --> 38:27.445
I did it!
That-that was my DNA!

38:27.479 --> 38:29.814
I... I'll-I'll tell you
everything!

38:29.848 --> 38:31.782
Just don't take my mom.
No.

38:31.817 --> 38:33.517
I had to.

38:34.853 --> 38:38.089
I had to protect you.

38:38.123 --> 38:40.424
I couldn't let another guy
take you away!

38:41.793 --> 38:42.960
Tim, what have you done?

38:45.297 --> 38:46.664
What have you done?

38:46.698 --> 38:48.032
You were right.

38:48.066 --> 38:50.134
He couldn't sacrifice
his own queen.

39:02.414 --> 39:03.814
Dr. Brennan,
I just thought

39:03.849 --> 39:05.583
I'd drop by your office
before I leave.

39:05.617 --> 39:08.119
You've finished cleaning
the bone room already?

39:08.153 --> 39:09.954
Well, actually, I won't be
cleaning the bone room,

39:09.988 --> 39:11.822
Dr. Brennan,
and I thank you for that.

39:11.857 --> 39:14.025
That makes no sense.

39:14.059 --> 39:16.827
I'm asserting myself--
something I learned from you,

39:16.862 --> 39:18.796
which I intend to share
with all my Canadian colleagues.

39:18.830 --> 39:22.266
I've decided, like you,
I'm too extraordinary to clean.

39:22.301 --> 39:24.435
But...
You've been

39:24.469 --> 39:26.270
an excellent example
to me, Dr. Brennan.

39:26.305 --> 39:28.139
Be confident, be stubborn,

39:28.173 --> 39:30.007
and shout down
the opposition, eh?

39:30.042 --> 39:31.609
Well, I...
I must go now.

39:31.643 --> 39:34.845
And you're welcome
for my outstanding expertise.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.981
Oh, you're
also welcome.

39:40.485 --> 39:41.719
What's this?

39:41.753 --> 39:44.155
This is from <i>Science Monthly.</i>

39:45.624 --> 39:49.193
Oh, Cam,
I'm actually very happy for you.

39:49.227 --> 39:51.028
Apologies are difficult for me.

39:51.063 --> 39:53.698
No. I appreciate that,
Dr. Brennan,

39:53.732 --> 39:56.534
but they actually want
to honor all three of us.

39:56.568 --> 39:58.169
Oh. Really?

39:58.203 --> 39:59.804
Because Cam insisted.

39:59.838 --> 40:01.238
We're nothing
without each other.

40:01.273 --> 40:03.274
Well, agreed,
but I've never heard

40:03.308 --> 40:05.876
of them honoring
three women before.

40:05.911 --> 40:09.513
Well, uh, this year,
there are 12.

40:09.548 --> 40:11.382
Twelve?

40:11.416 --> 40:16.454
They, uh... they sent us these
for a photo shoot.

40:16.488 --> 40:20.691
They're doing a calendar
this year.

40:20.726 --> 40:24.795
12 Outstanding Women of Science
showing a lot of skin.

40:24.830 --> 40:26.063
Magazine's having
budget problems,

40:26.098 --> 40:27.531
and they thought
this would help.

40:27.566 --> 40:29.567
I can tell them
to call three other scientists.

40:29.601 --> 40:31.702
Who are the nine scientists
who agreed to this?

40:31.737 --> 40:32.870
Um...

40:34.539 --> 40:36.607
Oh. Dr. Katherine Kasarinsky...

40:36.641 --> 40:40.211
Oh, she's a brilliant
quantum physicist.

40:40.245 --> 40:41.479
Dr. Jennifer Austin.

40:41.513 --> 40:42.580
She won the National
Medal of Science.

40:42.614 --> 40:43.948
Yes.

40:43.982 --> 40:45.182
Dr. Sun Yoon Chang...

40:45.217 --> 40:47.785
She's a Delta Science Fellow.

40:47.819 --> 40:50.521
So they actually are
outstanding women of science.

40:51.923 --> 40:53.391
I would hate to think of

40:53.425 --> 40:56.961
three <i>less</i> outstanding women
replacing us.

40:56.995 --> 40:58.996
But we'll be hanging in labs
all across the country.

40:59.031 --> 41:00.431
Exactly.

41:00.465 --> 41:03.701
We have a duty to show
the scientific community

41:03.735 --> 41:05.002
that the Jeffersonian

41:05.037 --> 41:06.504
is an institution
where pulchritude

41:06.538 --> 41:09.640
is as abundant
as brilliance.

41:09.674 --> 41:11.475
I never thought

41:11.510 --> 41:13.411
that I would be
honored in this way.

41:14.546 --> 41:16.514
Okay.

41:16.548 --> 41:18.849
Oh, my God.

41:18.884 --> 41:21.285
Dr. McClintock looks
wonderful on your breasts.

41:21.319 --> 41:22.486
Lookin' good.

41:22.521 --> 41:24.055
Oh, my God.

41:24.089 --> 41:25.556
I'm glad I got
Madame Curie.

41:25.590 --> 41:27.124
I can't...

41:38.737 --> 41:39.970
Ah!

41:40.005 --> 41:41.272
No...

41:41.306 --> 41:43.507
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
What?

41:43.542 --> 41:45.976
You can't make that move.
Why?

41:46.011 --> 41:48.145
Bishops can only move diagonally.
I thought that was the castle.

41:48.180 --> 41:50.681
That's a rook. It's called a rook.
Chess is like school.

41:50.715 --> 41:52.483
Why can't we just play checkers?

41:52.517 --> 41:55.252
No, there's no sophisticated
strategy in checkers.

41:55.287 --> 41:56.420
How about we have a game

41:56.455 --> 41:58.956
of Ready, Set, Fun?

41:58.990 --> 42:01.158
What? Christine's game?
Yeah.

42:01.193 --> 42:03.060
No, it's for children.

42:03.095 --> 42:04.829
What, you think I'm gonna kick
your ass in the Happy Hideaway?

42:04.863 --> 42:06.297
No, we're playing
chess, Booth.

42:06.331 --> 42:07.631
Right.
It's my move.

42:07.666 --> 42:08.799
Here we go!

42:08.834 --> 42:10.367
I'm not doing this, Booth.

42:10.402 --> 42:11.802
Come on.

42:11.837 --> 42:13.671
I'll be Tom Foolery...

42:13.705 --> 42:14.939
...and you can be

42:14.973 --> 42:16.640
Wendy Whoopee!

42:16.675 --> 42:18.109
No, no, no.

42:18.143 --> 42:20.344
I'm always
Hildy Highjinks.

42:20.378 --> 42:22.379
Hildy Highjinks, right.
You're getting into it, right?

42:22.414 --> 42:23.681
Okay, tell you what:

42:23.715 --> 42:26.083
if you pick a card
that says Two Giggles,

42:26.118 --> 42:27.184
you got to do a shot.

42:27.219 --> 42:28.385
One game.

42:28.420 --> 42:29.653
That's all it's gonna take.

42:29.688 --> 42:32.089
Ready, set, pick.

42:32.124 --> 42:33.524
Okay.

42:33.558 --> 42:35.326
I think I should come
to the photo shoot with you.

42:35.360 --> 42:36.560
Ooh...
I really do.

42:36.595 --> 42:38.329
Not going to happen.

42:38.363 --> 42:39.930
Right.

42:39.965 --> 42:42.366
Dah! Two Giggles! Drink!

42:42.400 --> 42:43.734
No, it's your card.
You drink.

42:43.768 --> 42:46.470
Hey... we both drink.

42:46.505 --> 42:47.705
Okay?

42:47.739 --> 42:49.340
There it is.

42:49.374 --> 42:50.541
Down the hatch.

42:50.575 --> 42:52.409
Mmm. You know what?

42:52.444 --> 42:53.577
I want to come
to the photo shoot with you.

42:53.612 --> 42:54.578
You know, for science.

42:54.613 --> 42:56.080
No.

42:56.114 --> 42:58.616
Look who's going to
Happy Hideaway.

42:58.650 --> 43:00.417
Who's giggling now?
Isn't this a lot better than chess?
