11:40.324 --> 11:41.951
Now, Mr. Lampwick,

11:42.034 --> 11:44.120
when Roger Myers stole
your character...

11:44.203 --> 11:46.330
-Objection.
-Sustained.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.290
If I hear "objection"
and "sustained"

11:48.374 --> 11:50.668
one more time today,
I think I'm going to scream.

11:50.751 --> 11:52.920
-Objection.
-Sustained.

11:53.003 --> 11:53.879
(screaming)

11:53.963 --> 11:55.756
Roger Myers didn't create
any of his characters.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.174
He stole them all.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.969
-He stole them all?
-(crowd murmuring)

12:00.052 --> 12:02.513
The only characters Myers
could ever come up with

12:02.596 --> 12:05.808
were pathetic stick figures
with the words "sarcastic horse"

12:05.891 --> 12:08.978
and "manic mailman" printed
on them, and they stank.

12:09.061 --> 12:12.064
So he started stealing
other people's characters.

12:12.148 --> 12:16.068
-That's a lie!
-Are you saying under oath, Mr. Myers,

12:16.152 --> 12:18.571
that your father didn't steal
any of the characters

12:18.654 --> 12:20.197
associated with your studio?

12:20.281 --> 12:22.199
Well, I don't think
I am under oath,

12:22.283 --> 12:24.618
but, yes,
my father created them all

12:24.702 --> 12:28.122
except for Flatulent Fox--
that was based on a true story--

12:28.205 --> 12:29.457
but he did create Itchy.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.333
That's one thing
I am sure of.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.878
Mr. Hutz, we've been in here
for four hours.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.838
Do you have any evidence at all?

12:35.921 --> 12:37.465
Well, Your Honor,

12:37.548 --> 12:39.341
we've got plenty
of hearsay and conjecture.

12:39.425 --> 12:41.177
Those are kinds of evidence.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.387
Your Honor,
I move for dismissal.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.560
I've got it!
Dad, give me $750.

12:49.643 --> 12:50.853
Okay.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.189
Keep the trial going.

12:53.272 --> 12:54.565
I'll be right back.

12:54.648 --> 12:55.941
Your Honor, I'd like to call

12:56.025 --> 12:58.235
all of my surprise
witnesses again.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.820
(crowd groaning)

13:07.244 --> 13:09.413
-(register rings)
-MERCHANT: Thank you.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.208
I knew I had seen this
exact scene somewhere else.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.752
It was in the movie
Mr. Lampwick showed me.

13:14.835 --> 13:18.589
Ladies and gentlemen,
this drawing was made in 1919,

13:18.672 --> 13:21.008
nine years before Roger Myers

13:21.091 --> 13:23.594
made his first
Itchy & Scratchy cartoon.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.347
That could have been drawn by
anyone at any time, Your Honor.

13:26.430 --> 13:29.308
There's no signature or date.

13:29.391 --> 13:31.268
Look under the frame, Brad.

13:31.352 --> 13:32.978
Careful...

13:33.062 --> 13:34.480
careful... whoops.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.607
It's there!

13:36.690 --> 13:37.691
Hmm...

13:37.775 --> 13:40.569
"To Roger Myers,
keep drawing.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.447
"Your moxie more than makes up
for your lack of talent.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.283
"Your pal, Chester J. Lampwick.

13:46.367 --> 13:48.202
September 3, 1919."

13:48.285 --> 13:51.163
(crowd clamoring)

13:51.247 --> 13:54.291
Okay, maybe my Dad
did steal Itchy,

13:54.375 --> 13:55.584
but so what?

13:55.668 --> 13:58.254
Animation is built
on plagiarism.

13:58.337 --> 14:01.048
If it weren't for someone
plagiarizing <i>The Honeymooners,</i>

14:01.131 --> 14:03.133
we wouldn't have
<i>The Flintstones.</i>

14:03.217 --> 14:05.386
If someone hadn't
ripped off <i>Sgt. Bilko,</i>

14:05.469 --> 14:07.221
there'd be no <i>Top Cat.</i>

14:07.304 --> 14:10.474
Huckleberry Hound,
Chief Wiggum, Yogi Bear. Hah!

14:10.558 --> 14:13.269
Andy Griffith,
Edward G. Robinson, Art Carney.

14:13.352 --> 14:16.647
Your Honor, you take away
our right to steal ideas,

14:16.730 --> 14:18.399
where are they going
to come from?

14:18.482 --> 14:19.900
Her?

14:19.984 --> 14:21.819
Uh... hmm.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.445
How about...

14:23.529 --> 14:24.947
Ghost Mutt?

14:25.030 --> 14:27.700
The court rules
in favor of Mr. Lampwick.

14:27.783 --> 14:29.660
Itchy & Scratchy Studios

14:29.743 --> 14:32.830
will pay a restitution
of $800 billion...

14:32.913 --> 14:35.749
though that amount will probably
come down a bit on appeal.

14:43.757 --> 14:47.928
I hope you're happy, kid.
The studio's bankrupt.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.598
You just killed
Itchy & Scratchy.

14:53.559 --> 14:56.729
-We killed Itchy & Scratchy?
-Good riddance.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.522
Want to go celebrate?

14:58.606 --> 15:00.900
I feel like
liver and onions.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.902
(smacking lips)
Mmm...

15:07.740 --> 15:09.408
(generator powering down)

15:13.287 --> 15:15.164
What are you going to do with
all your money, Mr. Lampwick?

15:15.247 --> 15:18.876
Well, first off,
here's your $1,000 back

15:18.959 --> 15:22.630
for hiring that lawyer,
and $750 for the drawing.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.798
And here's a couple of bucks
for your trouble.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.051
Whoo-hoo! Look, Marge,
a couple of bucks.

15:27.134 --> 15:30.262
As for the rest of it,
I'm going to buy the one thing

15:30.346 --> 15:33.307
I've been dreaming of all the
years I spent in the gutter--

15:33.390 --> 15:35.559
a solid-gold house.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.104
(whistling)

15:43.692 --> 15:45.986
Well, Itchy & Scratchy
are gone,

15:46.070 --> 15:49.365
but here's a cartoon that tries
to make learning fun.

15:49.448 --> 15:51.033
(unenthusiastic chuckle)

15:51.116 --> 15:52.576
Ohh.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.536
Sorry about this, kids,
but stay tuned.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.038
We got some real good
toy commercials

15:56.121 --> 15:57.498
coming right up, I swear.

15:59.708 --> 16:04.129
Hey! Who left all this garbage
on the steps of Congress?

16:04.213 --> 16:05.547
I'm not garbage.

16:05.631 --> 16:07.758

16:07.841 --> 16:09.927

But why can't we just make a law
against flag burning?

16:36.495 --> 16:39.456
AMENDMENT: Because that law
would be unconstitutional.

16:39.540 --> 16:42.084
But if we change
the constitution--

16:42.167 --> 16:44.294
Then we could make
all sorts of crazy laws!

16:44.378 --> 16:45.963
Now you're catching on.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.756
What the hell is this?

16:47.840 --> 16:49.591
It's one those campy
'70s throwbacks

16:49.675 --> 16:51.593
that appeals to
Generation Xers.

16:51.677 --> 16:54.013
We need another Vietnam to
thin out their ranks a little.

16:54.096 --> 16:55.723
What if people say
you're not good enough

16:55.806 --> 16:57.433

16:57.516 --> 17:01.061

Good news, amendment.

17:11.488 --> 17:14.658
You're in the U.S. Constitution.

17:14.742 --> 17:17.036
Oh, yeah!
Door's open, boys.

17:17.119 --> 17:20.622
-(loud yucking)
-(gunshots and laughter)

17:20.706 --> 17:23.667
(imitating Curly) Whoo-whoo-whoo-whoo,
whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.085
So it's true.

17:25.169 --> 17:28.005
Some cartoons do
encourage violence.

17:28.088 --> 17:30.758
Ow! We got to get
Itchy & Scratchy back.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.217
And soon!

17:32.301 --> 17:34.178
-Ow!
-Heh-heh.

17:36.972 --> 17:39.558
You've got to make more
Itchy & Scratchy cartoons.

17:39.641 --> 17:43.020
The judge says it's okay as long
as you pay Mr. Lampwick royalties.

17:43.103 --> 17:44.938
Royalties? Ha!

17:45.022 --> 17:47.566
I don't have the money
to produce the cartoons.

17:47.649 --> 17:50.235
I lost everything.
I can't even keep

17:50.319 --> 17:53.447
my Dad's head in the freaking
cryogenic center anymore.

17:53.530 --> 17:55.908
-(liquid dripping)
-(thud)

17:55.991 --> 17:57.326
You comfortable in there,
Daddy?

17:57.409 --> 17:59.286
Look, if money's
the only problem,

17:59.369 --> 18:00.871
I know a guy who
has lots of it.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.710
Shoe shine, sir?

18:06.794 --> 18:08.462
Comb your hair for you?

18:08.545 --> 18:09.463
-Sir?
-Hmm.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.673
Sir. Sir? Sir?

18:11.757 --> 18:13.884
Okay, catch you
on the way back.

18:13.967 --> 18:15.844
-Oh, hi, kids.
-Hi, Chester.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.304
Listen. Would you pay

18:17.387 --> 18:19.348
to make more Itchy
& Scratchy cartoons?

18:19.431 --> 18:22.017
-You'll get more royalties.
-I don't need any more money.

18:22.101 --> 18:26.021
I'm not greedy. As long as I've got
my health, and my millions of dollars,

18:26.105 --> 18:28.524
and my gold house,
and my rocket car,

18:28.607 --> 18:30.109
I don't need anything else.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.444
-Yes, but--
-Not interested.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.987
(snoring)

18:34.071 --> 18:38.867
-Dad, can we have $183,000?
-What for?

18:38.951 --> 18:41.495
Lisa and I want to finance
a series of animated cartoons.

18:41.578 --> 18:43.205
Oh, forget it.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.627
Oh... I give up.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.713
-There's nothing we can do.
-Yeah, I agree.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.716
You want to start on trying
to get Apu out of jail?

18:54.800 --> 18:56.343
Okay.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.764
Wait, kids! You can't give up
on Itchy & Scratchy.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.641
You're always so good
at these things.

19:02.724 --> 19:05.352
Why, together, you've reunited
Krusty with his father,

19:05.435 --> 19:07.146
gotten Principal Skinner's
job back,

19:07.229 --> 19:08.939
and helped Dr. Riviera

19:09.022 --> 19:11.400
perform open-heart surgery
on your father.

19:11.483 --> 19:13.443
You've even foiled
Sideshow Bob

19:13.527 --> 19:16.655
on five separate occasions,
and he's an evil genius.

19:16.738 --> 19:19.825
You're right, Mom.
I'm sure if we put our minds to it

19:19.908 --> 19:21.410
we can solve this one too.

19:25.539 --> 19:27.916
(gasps):
Bart, look at this.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.961
(panting)
What a perfect plan.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.380
Now, Roger Myers' hotel
is just--

19:33.463 --> 19:35.299
And so, when no one
could think

19:35.382 --> 19:37.843
of a plan to resurrect
Itchy & Scratchy,

19:37.926 --> 19:39.219
a young boy--

19:39.303 --> 19:42.014
a wonderful, irrepressible
young boy--

19:42.097 --> 19:45.017
took it on his own
to solve the problem.

19:45.100 --> 19:50.480
He discovered that the postal service's
"Mr. Zip" was just a rip-off

19:50.564 --> 19:55.402
of my father's stick figure
character "Manic Mailman."

19:55.485 --> 20:00.115
So the government gave me
a huge cash settlement

20:00.199 --> 20:03.911
and Itchy & Scratchy Studios
is back in business.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.162
(generator powering up)

20:05.245 --> 20:07.206
Thanks to you, Lester.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.794
-(both gasp)
-What the hell is going on?

20:12.878 --> 20:15.214
I don't know,
but it looks like

20:15.297 --> 20:18.008
you might have a little
competition all of a sudden.

20:18.091 --> 20:21.178
Thanks, everybody, but I
couldn't have done all this

20:21.261 --> 20:24.973
without the help of
my brainy sister Eliza.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.725
(gasps)

20:26.808 --> 20:30.520
I, too, owe many thanks
to Lester and Eliza.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.731
This is a great vindication
for anybody

20:32.814 --> 20:35.275
who was ever taking a bath,
went to get the paper,

20:35.359 --> 20:37.277
fell down, and had the door
slam behind them

20:37.361 --> 20:38.904
and the doorknob break off.

20:38.987 --> 20:40.864
And I'd like to thank Lester

20:40.948 --> 20:43.492
for reuniting me
with my estranged wife.

20:43.575 --> 20:45.702
(applause)

20:45.786 --> 20:48.664
-I never even heard about that.
-I don't understand it.

We're always the ones
who solve these problems.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.419
I guess you don't
need it now,

20:54.503 --> 20:56.255

20:56.338 --> 20:58.507
Hey, great.
