GREAT NEWS--

00:09.143 --> 00:10.444
I'VE GOT
TWO TICKETS

00:10.511 --> 00:13.147

CHICAGO ROCK

00:13.214 --> 00:17.785
I HEAR THEY HAVE
A FABULOUS GRAVEL
EXHIBIT THIS YEAR.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.287
THANKS, BUT I'M BUSY.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.889
I DIDN'T SAY
WHAT NIGHT IT IS.

00:21.955 --> 00:24.792
THANKS. I'M BUSY
EVERY NIGHT.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.361
I UNDERSTAND,

00:27.428 --> 00:29.063
THERE'S THE BOAT SHOW.

00:29.130 --> 00:34.135
EDDIE...MY BUDDY,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

00:34.202 --> 00:36.204
I CAN GET US
BACKSTAGE PASSES.

00:36.270 --> 00:41.142
THANKS, STEVE,
BUT I'M ALLERGIC
TO ROCKS.

00:41.209 --> 00:43.043
HEY, I'M ALLERGIC
TO EVERYTHING,

00:43.111 --> 00:46.580
AND I'M STILL GOING.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.949
JUDY!

00:49.016 --> 00:50.951
IT'S YOUR LUCKY NIGHT.

00:51.018 --> 00:51.952
PASS.

00:52.019 --> 00:53.121
OH, NO PROBLEM.

00:53.187 --> 00:55.689
I CAN BRING YOU BACK
A T-SHIRT.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.193
RICHIE!

01:11.339 --> 01:13.307

01:13.374 --> 01:14.808
* IN THIS DAY AND AGE *

ON THE NEWSPAPER PAGE *

01:18.579 --> 01:21.749
* AND LOVE AND TRADITION

03:27.508 --> 03:29.977
HOW WAS
BABYSITTING, HONEY?

03:30.043 --> 03:33.113
THOSE MURPHY TWINS
ARE A COUPLE
OF WILD ANIMALS.

03:33.180 --> 03:36.750
I'M GETTING TOO OLD
FOR THIS LINE OF WORK.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.387
LAURA, YOU'RE INVOLVED
IN TOO MANY ACTIVITIES.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.955
RIGHT. I'VE
THOUGHT IT OVER

03:42.022 --> 03:43.190
AND MADE A DECISION.

03:43.257 --> 03:45.025
TO CUT BACK
ON BABYSITTING?

03:45.092 --> 03:47.295
NO. I'M GOING TO EXPAND.

03:47.361 --> 03:50.130
CARL,
SHE'S DELIRIOUS.

03:50.197 --> 03:51.632
WHAT I MEAN IS,

03:51.699 --> 03:54.201
I'M STARTING MY OWN
BABYSITTING SERVICE.

03:54.268 --> 03:56.304
START YOUR
OWN BUSINESS?

03:56.370 --> 03:58.205
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

03:58.272 --> 04:00.974
SURE, I'LL HIRE A STAFF
OF BABYSITTERS,

04:01.041 --> 04:03.444
BOOK THE JOBS,
AND TAKE 10%.

04:03.511 --> 04:06.146
I'LL MAKE 50 BUCKS
A NIGHT STAYING HOME.

04:06.213 --> 04:08.349
I'M GOING TO MAKE
SOME BUSINESS CARDS.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.288
ALRIGHT.
THANKS A LOT.

04:14.355 --> 04:16.256
I HAD
A WONDERFUL TIME.

04:16.324 --> 04:17.691
YEAH. ME, TOO,
RACHEL.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.461
IT'S STILL EARLY.
MAYBE WE COULD
HAVE COFFEE?

04:20.528 --> 04:22.563
NO! NO, NO, NO, NO.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.365
WE DON'T DRINK
COFFEE.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.366
WE'RE ALL
TOO HIGH-STRUNG.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.734
GOODNIGHT.

04:32.540 --> 04:35.343
ANOTHER LOSER,
HUH, RACHEL?

04:35.409 --> 04:38.346
NO. I LIKE JEFF.

04:38.412 --> 04:40.648
WELL, THEN,
WHY DIDN'T YOU
INVITE HIM IN?

04:42.883 --> 04:45.052
MAYBE SHE'S EMBARRASSED
BY HER FAMILY.

04:48.155 --> 04:51.191
OH, CARL...NO.

04:51.258 --> 04:52.893
THE TRUTH IS,

04:52.960 --> 04:55.496
I HAVEN'T TOLD HIM
ABOUT LITTLE RICHIE YET.

04:55.563 --> 04:57.498
IF YOU LIKE
EACH OTHER,

04:57.565 --> 04:59.433
JUST TELL HIM
ABOUT RICHIE.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.569
I DON'T WANT
TO SCARE HIM.

05:01.635 --> 05:04.104
LAST TIME I TOLD
A DATE ABOUT RICHIE,

05:04.171 --> 05:07.107
I HAD TO TAKE
THE BUS HOME.

05:07.174 --> 05:08.876
WAIT TILL YOU'RE MY AGE.

05:08.942 --> 05:12.446
THE BUS RIDE
IS THE HIGHLIGHT
OF THE DATE.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.323
NO, SIR,
CAPTAIN DAVENPORT,

05:23.391 --> 05:25.859
THERE IS NOTHING
I LIKE MORE THAN FISHING.

05:25.926 --> 05:28.629
EXCEPT, OF COURSE,
WORKING FOR YOU.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.843
CARL, YOU WANT ME
TO FRY THAT

05:42.910 --> 05:45.379
OR THROW IT BACK?

05:45.446 --> 05:47.748
HARRIETTE, I FINALLY
FOUND OUT A WAY

05:47.815 --> 05:49.417
TO IMPRESS
CAPTAIN DAVENPORT.

05:49.483 --> 05:50.751
HE LIKES FISHING.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.686
I'LL TAKE HIM
TO THE LAKE,

05:52.753 --> 05:54.755
DO SOME FISHING,
SOME TALKING.

05:54.822 --> 05:55.656
WAIT, CARL.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.158
YOU'RE TAKING HIM
FISHING TO TALK?

05:58.225 --> 06:00.461
TALK TO HIM
AT THE STATION.

06:00.528 --> 06:02.730
HARRIETTE,
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW

06:02.796 --> 06:04.932
THE WAY THE WORLD
WORKS, DO YOU?

06:06.299 --> 06:08.402
GUIDE ME, O WISE ONE.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.407
I'LL GIVE YOU
A GUIDE.

06:14.341 --> 06:15.976
[TELEPHONE RINGS]

06:17.177 --> 06:18.446
IT'S FOR ME!

06:18.512 --> 06:21.214
IT'S REBECCA.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.450
WHAT'S HAPPENING, BABY?

06:24.685 --> 06:26.487
WHO?

06:26.554 --> 06:29.457
MAN...LAURA,
IT'S FOR YOU!

06:32.192 --> 06:33.461
I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.129
ANOTHER FRIDAY NIGHT,
AND I'M DATELESS.

06:36.196 --> 06:37.898
IS THERE SOMETHING
WRONG WITH ME?

06:42.102 --> 06:44.037
WINSLOW SITTING SERVICE.

06:44.104 --> 06:47.407
AM I AS HANDSOME
AS I WAS TWO WEEKS AGO?

06:47.475 --> 06:50.077
I STILL HAVE MY
KILLER EYES, DON'T I?

06:51.912 --> 06:53.080
MOM?

06:54.715 --> 06:55.549
JUDY?

06:55.616 --> 06:58.185
EDDIE, GET A LIFE.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.822
NO, NO. I'M SORRY.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.024
WE DON'T HAVE ANY
SITTERS AVAILABLE
THAT NIGHT.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.526
WE CAN ACCOMMODATE YOU

07:05.593 --> 07:07.861
IF YOU CHANGE THE DATE
OF THE FUNERAL.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.036
HARRIETTE, HARRIETTE.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.539
I WANT MY DATE WITH JEFF
TO BE PERFECT

07:18.606 --> 07:20.774
WHICH DRESS DO YOU LIKE?
PINK OR RED?

07:20.841 --> 07:22.910
I LOVE THAT RED DRESS
ON YOU, RACHEL.

07:22.976 --> 07:24.745
BUT ARE YOU
THINKING LIKE A MAN?

07:24.812 --> 07:26.213
WELL, IF I WERE A MAN,

07:26.279 --> 07:28.348
I'D LOVE THAT LOW-CUT
PINK DRESS ON YOU.

07:28.415 --> 07:31.218
SURE. YOU JUST WANT ME
FOR MY BODY.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.990
HARRIETTE!
HARRIETTE, I AM IN!

07:37.057 --> 07:38.692
I AM IN, HARRIETTE.

07:38.759 --> 07:40.060
I CAN SEE THAT.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.395
NOW SHUT THE DOOR.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.797
I FINALLY
GOT UP COURAGE

07:43.864 --> 07:46.066
TO SPEAK WITH
CAPTAIN DAVENPORT.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.668
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

07:47.735 --> 07:49.703
I REMEMBER
WORD-FOR-WORD.

07:49.770 --> 07:53.473
I SAID TO HIM,
"HEY, CAPTAIN,
HOW'S IT GOING?"

07:53.541 --> 07:57.177
HE LOOKED ME IN THE EYE
AND SAID, "WHO ARE YOU?"

07:59.613 --> 08:00.848
THIS IS TOO WEIRD.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.083
NOW DIANNE
IS CANCELING, TOO.

08:03.150 --> 08:06.153
I NEED SOMEBODY
FOR THE KRAMER BABY.
WHO'S LEFT?

08:06.219 --> 08:09.322
NOBODY.

08:09.389 --> 08:11.191
I GUESS I COULD CALL
STEVE URKEL.

08:13.026 --> 08:14.194
DID I SAY THAT?

08:17.531 --> 08:20.601
CAPTAIN DAVENPORT'S
GOING TO RECOMMEND YOU
FOR LIEUTENANT?

08:20.668 --> 08:23.303
I FIGURE I'D EASE
INTO IT TONIGHT.

08:23.370 --> 08:25.338
I INVITED HIM
FOR DINNER.

08:25.405 --> 08:26.373
TONIGHT?

08:26.439 --> 08:28.375
YEAH, HIS WIFE
WAS OUT OF TOWN.

08:28.441 --> 08:29.943
IT'S PERFECT.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.511
ISN'T IT?

08:31.579 --> 08:33.313
I'M WARNING YOU,
RENITA.

08:33.380 --> 08:34.782
IF YOU CANCEL ON ME,

08:34.848 --> 08:37.450
YOU'LL NEVER SIT
IN THIS TOWN AGAIN.

08:37.517 --> 08:38.786
RENITA.

08:38.852 --> 08:39.920
RENITA!

08:41.388 --> 08:42.990
THE KID IS BACK!

08:43.056 --> 08:45.959
IT'S FRIDAY NIGHT,
AND I'VE GOT A DATE.

08:46.026 --> 08:48.461
PARDON ME, BUT YOU
MUST HAVE MISTAKEN ME

08:48.528 --> 08:50.598
FOR SOMEBODY WHO CARES.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.967
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

08:54.034 --> 08:55.268
ALL MY SITTERS
HAVE CANCELED.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.037
WHY IS THIS
HAPPENING?

08:57.104 --> 08:58.305
THAT'S EASY.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.641
PAULA ABDUL'S IN TOWN
GIVING A SURPRISE CONCERT.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.109
EVERYONE'S GOING.

09:02.175 --> 09:05.579
HOW COULD ALL MY GIRLS GO?
IT'S LIMITED SEATING.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.180
WELL, IF YOU CALL

09:07.247 --> 09:10.751
THE 65,000 SEATS
AT SOLDIERS' FIELD
LIMITED, YEAH.

09:13.353 --> 09:15.288
ALRIGHT. DON'T PANIC.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.758
THERE'S NOTHING
GOING ON HERE TONIGHT,

09:17.825 --> 09:21.662
SO WE HAVE THE HOUSE
ALL TO OURSELVES.

09:21.729 --> 09:24.531
I'LL HAVE THE PARENTS
BRING THEIR KIDS HERE.

09:24.598 --> 09:26.233
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME,

09:26.299 --> 09:29.169
BUT WE CAN HANDLE
15 KIDS.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.203
WE?

09:30.270 --> 09:31.905
I'M OUT OF HERE.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.651
NO, NO THERE'S
NO PROBLEM,
MISS PRICE.

09:43.717 --> 09:46.019
IF YOU'LL JUST
DROP YOUR SON
AT MY HOUSE,

09:46.086 --> 09:48.922
MY SISTER AND I
WILL BE DELIGHTED
TO LOOK AFTER HIM.

09:50.357 --> 09:51.625
OKAY. BYE.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.795
OKAY...OKAY.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.730
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

09:56.797 --> 09:59.366
I DECIDED TO GO
WITH THE RED DRESS.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.234
IS THE RED DRESS OKAY?

10:01.301 --> 10:02.770
THAT'S BLACK.

10:02.836 --> 10:05.739
RIGHT. I WENT
WITH THE BLACK DRESS.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.507
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL,
AUNT RACHEL.

10:07.574 --> 10:08.709
OH, THANKS, SWEETHEART.

10:08.776 --> 10:11.378
LAURA, TONIGHT'S
THE NIGHT

10:11.444 --> 10:12.946
I TELL JEFF
ABOUT LITTLE RICHIE.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.716
SHOULD I TELL HIM
RIGHT AWAY,

10:15.783 --> 10:17.050
TELL HIM
AT INTERMISSION,

10:17.117 --> 10:20.020
WAIT UNTIL DINNER,
OR TELL HIM IN THE CAR?

10:20.087 --> 10:22.322
IT'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.
JUST WISH ME LUCK.

10:22.389 --> 10:23.390
AUNT RACHEL...

10:23.456 --> 10:24.825
YES?

10:24.892 --> 10:27.327
YOU WANT HIM TO KNOE ABOUT
YOUR KID RIGHT AWAY?

10:27.394 --> 10:28.796
DEFINITELY NOT.

10:28.862 --> 10:32.632
THEN YOU OUGHT TO LEAVE
LITTLE RICHIE HERE.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.867
GOOD POINT.

10:34.702 --> 10:36.169
BYE, BABY.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.109
WELL, HAVE
A GOOD EVENING.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.544
I KNOW I WILL.

10:44.611 --> 10:45.679
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

10:45.746 --> 10:47.715
YOU'RE TAKING CARE
OF RICHIE.

10:47.781 --> 10:50.350
OH. THAT WAS
BEFORE I HAD A DATE.

10:51.819 --> 10:53.954
I DON'T HAVE
LOTS OF TIME,

10:54.021 --> 10:56.323
SO I'LL TELL YOU
STRAIGHT.

10:56.389 --> 10:57.825
I'M GOING
TO THE CONCERT,

10:57.891 --> 10:59.760
AND YOU'VE GOT
THE MURPHY TWINS.

10:59.827 --> 11:02.863
PENNY...YOU CAN'T
DO THIS TO ME.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.765
I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND.

11:04.832 --> 11:08.135
THAT'S WHY I FEEL
SO TERRIBLE ABOUT THIS.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.302
BYE.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.805
I'M OUT OF HERE.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.207
IF YOU DON'T
HELP ME BABYSIT,

11:14.274 --> 11:17.144
I'LL TELL MOM AND DAD
ABOUT THAT LITTLE INCIDENT

11:17.210 --> 11:20.447
THAT OCCURRED
AT SCHOOL LAST WEEK.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.215
WHAT INCIDENT?

11:22.282 --> 11:24.952
DON'T PLAY DUMB WITH ME.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.820
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT

11:26.887 --> 11:28.421
YOU WOULDN'T.

11:28.488 --> 11:30.690
TRY ME.

11:31.859 --> 11:35.428
OKAY...YOU GOT ME.

11:35.495 --> 11:36.696
I'LL STAY.

11:39.499 --> 11:40.600
WHAT DID HE DO
AT SCHOOL?

11:40.667 --> 11:41.701
BEATS ME.

11:41.769 --> 11:43.837
KNOWING EDDIE,
I JUST TOOK A SHOT.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.952
HEY! GIVE ME BACK
MY WALLET.

11:59.019 --> 12:01.721
EDDIE. I THINK RICHIE
NEEDS CHANGING.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.025
YOU KNOW WHAT?

12:05.092 --> 12:06.894
I'VE BEEN THINKIN'
ABOUT THIS.

12:06.960 --> 12:11.164
I REALLY DON'T THINK
I DID ANYTHING AT
SCHOOL LAST WEEK.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.633
OH. ARE YOU FORGETTIN'
ABOUT THAT INCIDENT

12:13.700 --> 12:15.268
WITH RODNEY?

12:15.335 --> 12:17.304
OH.

12:22.342 --> 12:25.578
OH, LAURA,
I SEE YOU'RE
HAVING A PARTY.

12:25.645 --> 12:26.880
I WOULD HAVE
COME SOONER,

12:26.947 --> 12:28.816
