(Squawking)

00:55.764 --> 00:57.891
Two tickets
for the basketball final?

00:57.891 --> 01:03.522
Yep. My dad's playing and I can
take whoever I want, but who?

01:03.522 --> 01:05.566
Gee, I've got no idea.

01:06.692 --> 01:08.735
(Laughter)

01:08.735 --> 01:09.987
Well, you in, Andy?

01:11.029 --> 01:14.366
Yes, yes, a million times yes!

01:14.366 --> 01:16.118
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
Mike!

01:18.120 --> 01:21.665
Yo! How come Andy
gets to go to the finals?

01:21.999 --> 01:25.544
Uh, 'cause he's my bestie
and he's crazy about basketball?

01:25.544 --> 01:26.920
Too bad he stinks at it.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.381
You should take
the top player instead.

01:29.381 --> 01:32.134
Which is totally
what he's doing.

01:32.134 --> 01:36.763
Yeah, right! Bobby,
who won our last one‐on‐one?

01:36.763 --> 01:40.434
0Er, he did.
I mean you, er, crushed it.

01:40.434 --> 01:43.145
Whatever!
This time we play sudden death.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.689
First one
to miss a basket loses.

01:45.689 --> 01:46.815
It's the law of the jungle.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.026
The winner
goes to the finals with Mike.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.403
‐ What?
‐ Challenge accepted.

01:51.903 --> 01:53.905
Get ready to be destroyed.

01:57.159 --> 01:59.578
So, let me get this straight.

01:59.578 --> 02:02.664
You get front‐row tickets to see
your ultimate fanboy dream,

02:02.664 --> 02:05.876
‐ Michael Collins...
‐ Mmm‐hmm.

02:05.876 --> 02:09.087
Only to risk it all
in a stupid dare with Drake.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.298
Doesn't matter. I'll crush this.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.550
There can only be
one king of the jungle.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.803
Let's see
how awesome you are now!

03:00.889 --> 03:03.642
So, still gonna crush this?

03:03.642 --> 03:04.559
Let's do it!

03:18.824 --> 03:22.160
‐ Woohoo!
‐ Nothing but net. Ha, ha!

03:22.160 --> 03:24.705
Beat that basket, bozo!

03:24.996 --> 03:27.165
Can't. No ball. Sorry.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.292
‐ Here's one.
‐ ANDY: What?

03:29.709 --> 03:32.087
You just gonna give up,
right in front of everybody?

03:34.506 --> 03:37.134
Yo, Bobby! I'm thirsty!
Gimme some water!

03:37.134 --> 03:39.678
Who's got water?
Anybody got water?

03:39.678 --> 03:42.722
The MVP needs H20, ASAP!

03:45.225 --> 03:46.852
‐ Huh?
‐ Do you think he'll do it?

04:09.666 --> 04:10.917
Huh?

04:14.045 --> 04:17.591
So, you thirsty
or are you just chokin'?

04:17.591 --> 04:20.927
Bobs, what's the ETA on my H20?
I need it ASAP.

04:20.927 --> 04:23.680
Ghost coming!

04:31.730 --> 04:34.941
(Wild cry)

04:39.988 --> 04:43.200
‐ (Evil laugh)
‐ Let's go, Ghost Force!

04:43.617 --> 04:46.077
<i>Ghost Force!</i>
<i>Don't fear the glow!</i>

04:51.958 --> 04:53.460
Fury!

04:54.085 --> 04:55.504
Krush!

04:56.713 --> 04:58.465
Myst!

05:01.718 --> 05:02.969
Ghost Force!

05:12.229 --> 05:14.105
(Growls)

05:20.237 --> 05:23.114
(Wild cry)

05:23.114 --> 05:26.117
‐ Hey, bucketbrains! Ugh!
‐ Ow!

05:30.038 --> 05:31.873
(Wild cry)

05:35.126 --> 05:37.337
‐ You gotta be kidding me!
‐ It's building an army!

05:43.844 --> 05:44.636
Aaah!

05:51.059 --> 05:53.061
My Boo energy won't last long!

05:53.061 --> 05:55.397
You know the drill.
Protect and evacuate!

06:03.738 --> 06:06.366
Hold up, Drake!
This is way too risky!

06:06.366 --> 06:08.451
Whatever, man. Just need one try

06:08.451 --> 06:10.328
without
a whole audience staring.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.873
‐ What if the ghost comes back?
‐ It's all good.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.834
The Ghost Force are keeping the
bucketheads busy!

06:19.963 --> 06:21.548
‐ Aaah!
‐ Aaah!

06:25.010 --> 06:26.970
‐ Everyone's here?
‐ Yes!

06:26.970 --> 06:29.681
OK, take care of this tin can!
I'll get the citizens to safety!

06:35.729 --> 06:36.688
That was so scary!

06:45.906 --> 06:48.992
‐ They're too strong!
‐ Hey, Ms Jones, we need help!

06:48.992 --> 06:51.870
<i>Sorry, kids, I was watching</i>
<i>an animal documentary</i>

06:51.870 --> 06:53.246
<i>about Amazonian wolves.</i>

06:53.955 --> 06:56.833
It was fascinating!
Did you know they move in pack?

06:56.833 --> 06:58.960
<i>No time!</i>
<i>Ghosts multiply in waves!</i>

06:58.960 --> 07:02.255
I know!
Once it chooses a territory,

07:02.255 --> 07:04.466
its pack chases away
all the inhabitants

07:04.466 --> 07:07.177
so they can take over!
It's the law of the jungle!

07:07.177 --> 07:08.803
The urban jungle.

07:08.803 --> 07:09.846
(Howls)

07:19.397 --> 07:20.982
Myst!

07:26.279 --> 07:28.365
Ha, ha!

07:32.911 --> 07:33.953
‐ Aaah!
‐ Aaah!

07:36.873 --> 07:39.751
(Wild cry)

07:39.751 --> 07:41.461
<i>Stop working yourself up.</i>

07:42.170 --> 07:45.423
<i>You must eliminate the first</i>
<i>Mizuo to stop all the others!</i>

07:45.423 --> 07:47.967
You mean the leader?
I got this!

07:48.551 --> 07:50.261
Fury, wait!
You can't take it on alone!

07:58.186 --> 08:01.690
Yo, faucet‐face!
Time to close the floodgates!

08:13.827 --> 08:14.911
‐ (Battle cry)
‐ (Wild cry)

08:14.911 --> 08:16.287
Uh‐oh!

08:16.913 --> 08:18.665
‐ Aaah!
‐ Told ya that'd happen.

08:21.793 --> 08:25.296
Ugh!
That's one heavy‐duty hosing!

08:37.267 --> 08:38.184
Whoa...

08:40.228 --> 08:42.355
That gives me an idea!

08:42.772 --> 08:45.775
Yeah! See that, Bobby?
I knew I could do it!

08:45.775 --> 08:47.569
(Evil laugh)

08:52.490 --> 08:53.950
(Wild cry)

08:53.950 --> 08:55.368
Aaah!

08:57.746 --> 09:00.290
Aw, man, not the green one.
Why couldn't it be Myst?

09:01.124 --> 09:03.084
‐ Could you do that again?
‐ Do what?

09:03.084 --> 09:05.545
Sink that basket!
Can you do it or not?

09:05.545 --> 09:08.715
Oh, totally! I'm the real MVP!

09:08.715 --> 09:10.800
Oh,
then I'm gonna need your help!

09:13.178 --> 09:15.930
‐ There's too many of them.
‐ And I'm low on Boo power!

09:15.930 --> 09:18.892
It's cool.
I brought a substitute player.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.227
‐ Uh... Say that again?
‐ OK, Flake ‐‐

09:21.227 --> 09:23.313
‐ Drake.
‐ Whatever.

09:23.313 --> 09:25.523
We need you to sink a basket
like the one just did.

09:25.523 --> 09:27.317
But, this time,
that is your target.

09:28.109 --> 09:31.112
‐ (Wild cry)
‐ What? No way I can do that.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.239
You should ask Andy,
from my school.

09:33.239 --> 09:36.201
He sounds pretty cool.
But nobody's better than you,

09:36.201 --> 09:39.496
the real MVP, remember?
You can do this!

09:41.081 --> 09:41.873
OK.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.426
‐ You're up!
‐ Yoohoo! Over here!

09:56.888 --> 09:58.556
‐ Your turn, Flake!
‐ Aaah!

10:10.527 --> 10:13.071
Uh‐oh! Aaah!

10:16.241 --> 10:18.785
Aaah! Hey... How are you doing?

10:26.793 --> 10:27.877
(Evil laugh)

10:30.463 --> 10:33.133
‐ Aaah!
‐ Now it's my turn.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.011
Dragoyle!

10:42.100 --> 10:43.518
Roar!

10:47.480 --> 10:49.065
(Battle cry)

10:52.110 --> 10:52.819
Aaah!

10:55.029 --> 10:56.739
Aaah!

11:18.511 --> 11:21.139
I swear,
I sunk the ultimate basket!

11:21.139 --> 11:23.892
Just ask the Green Ghost dude.
He saw it all!

11:23.892 --> 11:26.144
You mean Fury? He's my fave.

11:26.144 --> 11:29.439
But how's lil ol' me supposed
to contact a big star like him?

11:29.439 --> 11:32.442
‐ Hmm.
‐ Listen, dude, take my ticket.

11:32.442 --> 11:36.905
I didn't see your shot with
my own eyes, but I believe you.

11:36.905 --> 11:38.615
‐ You win this time.
‐ Did that ghost

11:38.615 --> 11:40.742
smack you upside the head?

11:40.742 --> 11:43.661
Let's just call it a "thank you"
for helping us beat Mizuo.

11:43.661 --> 11:45.788
Oh, I'm proud of you, Andy.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.541
Here, take my ticket.
You and Drake can go together!

11:48.541 --> 11:50.501
Just don't fight
during the game, OK?

11:50.919 --> 11:53.546
I may know how to keep my cool,
but him...

11:53.546 --> 11:56.883
What? Are you
challenging me to a cool‐off?

11:56.883 --> 11:58.676
‐ How about we go together?
‐ Cool!

11:58.676 --> 12:01.262
Except I don't know anything
about basketball.

12:01.262 --> 12:03.556
No worries, neither do I.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.975
I can keep my cool
way harder than you!

12:05.975 --> 12:07.101
Oh, yeah? Bring it!

12:08.144 --> 12:09.854
(Laughter)

12:26.704 --> 12:28.081
Ugh!

12:31.125 --> 12:32.877
Huh?

12:36.506 --> 12:38.591
Whoa! Cool!

12:57.026 --> 12:58.611
What are you doing here?

12:58.611 --> 13:00.613
We were meant to meet out back!

13:00.613 --> 13:04.909
Out in the cold? You trusted me
to choose these flowers for you.

13:04.909 --> 13:09.080
Now trust me when I tell you to
keep 'em warm. They're delicate.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.873
Are you bonkers?

13:10.873 --> 13:14.085
If I get seen with these
my rep as Cool Marlo is over.

13:14.085 --> 13:16.379
More like "Cool Marlo" is over

13:16.379 --> 13:19.007
if anyone finds out
who those flowers are for.

13:20.008 --> 13:21.175
(Groans)

13:21.759 --> 13:23.761
(General chatter)

13:26.556 --> 13:28.808
You do realise
that's my locker, right?

13:28.808 --> 13:31.269
Yeah. And what did you
just put in there, Marlo?

13:34.439 --> 13:36.524
‐ These are... for me?
‐ Uh...

13:38.526 --> 13:41.571
Uh... that's super sweet...
and a surprise.

13:42.739 --> 13:45.533
My birthday was ages ago,
but flowers can be for whenever.

13:46.200 --> 13:48.036
(Gasps)

13:50.329 --> 13:55.293
Anyway, thanks, Marlo.
You're a... er, swell fella.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.462
See ya 'round!

13:57.462 --> 13:58.963
(Andy whistling casually)

14:00.339 --> 14:02.216
Aw, man!

14:10.433 --> 14:12.226
Yes!

14:15.188 --> 14:16.773
(Gasps)

14:26.199 --> 14:27.366
(Chuckles)

14:30.453 --> 14:33.206
What is just happened
with you and Cool Marlo?

14:33.206 --> 14:36.042
Is he, like, your boyfriend now?

14:36.042 --> 14:38.711
What're you talking about?
No way. He's after me.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.006
Ugh! Too bad, 'cause Liv‐Lo

14:42.006 --> 14:44.008
is catchy
as a celebrity couple name.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.594
You know,
blushing is a nervous reaction

14:46.594 --> 14:49.806
brought on by strong emotions,
like love.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.808
I blushed
'cause I was embarrassed.

14:51.808 --> 14:54.977
Marlo's just a friend.
I don't like him like that.

14:54.977 --> 14:57.814
Why didn't you
just tell him that?

14:57.814 --> 15:00.608
I dunno. I guess I didn't
want to hurt his feelings.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.986
Aha!
So you do have feelings for him!

15:03.986 --> 15:08.449
(Sniffs the air)
Er, anybody smell funky fish?

15:08.449 --> 15:11.452
Aaah! It smells!

15:15.206 --> 15:17.875
‐ (Evil laugh)
‐ Aaah!

15:22.463 --> 15:24.132
(Gasps)

15:25.466 --> 15:28.386
‐ Ugh!
‐ Aaah!

15:28.386 --> 15:29.804
Great. That's all we need!

15:29.804 --> 15:32.765
Not another ghost with B. O.

15:32.765 --> 15:34.725
There goes my appetite.

15:34.725 --> 15:36.435
Let's go, Ghost Force!

15:37.353 --> 15:39.981
<i>Ghost Force!</i>
<i>Don't fear the glow!</i>

15:45.403 --> 15:46.696
Fury!

15:47.530 --> 15:48.990
Krush!

15:50.366 --> 15:51.617
Myst!

15:55.413 --> 15:56.664
Ghost Force!

15:58.875 --> 16:01.669
‐ (Phone rings)
‐ Miss Jones? We got a problem.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.672
<i>I know. Upgrading Glow‐Boo</i>
<i>is a serious pain!</i>

16:04.672 --> 16:07.758
<i>‐ Or is it something else?</i>
‐ We've a ghost on the loose

16:07.758 --> 16:09.844
and school
stinks like a fish market.

16:09.844 --> 16:13.055
But Liv has a new boyfriend
so I guess things are on the up!

16:13.055 --> 16:18.519
‐ Drop it before I drop you!
‐ Ah, young love! How romantic!

16:18.519 --> 16:20.938
Reminds me of my first date
when I was 21.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.608
It's like it was just yesterday.

16:23.608 --> 16:25.902
KRUSH: <i>How about</i>
<i>we get back to the ghost?</i>

16:25.902 --> 16:30.072
Indeed. That's Sharkoak,
a level‐7 glutton phantom.

16:30.072 --> 16:32.617
I've caught one before,
but not in booster mode.

16:32.617 --> 16:36.537
Be on guard. I'll send Glowboo
as soon he's finished updating.

16:39.582 --> 16:41.292
Aaah!

16:41.709 --> 16:43.002
(Evil laugh)

16:46.464 --> 16:49.675
At it's current speed,
it'll soon go into booster mode.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.802
We got to divert it
away from the crowds.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.763
Sounds like your expertise,
Myst.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.184
(Evil laugh)

17:06.901 --> 17:09.570
Marlo? My bouquet?

17:09.570 --> 17:12.281
What're you waiting for,
Myst, a drumroll?

17:19.455 --> 17:21.123
Aaah!

17:24.585 --> 17:27.630
I said send it away
from the crowds, not into them!

17:27.630 --> 17:29.340
Oh, no! What have I done?

17:31.926 --> 17:33.469
(Evil laugh)

17:33.886 --> 17:35.429
(Evil laugh)

17:56.409 --> 17:57.743
Flexy beam!

18:05.835 --> 18:07.878
‐ Aaah!
‐ Fractal mace!

18:15.636 --> 18:16.804
Ha, ha, ha!

18:22.435 --> 18:23.436
Aaah!

18:24.937 --> 18:26.022
(Evil laugh)

18:27.106 --> 18:28.107
Hurry up!

18:29.942 --> 18:31.736
Watch out!

18:38.784 --> 18:40.202
Roar!

18:42.496 --> 18:44.665
Nice one, Glowboo,
that was getting way too hot!

18:45.499 --> 18:47.335
Hot? Error detected.

18:47.335 --> 18:49.629
My upgrade confirms
the temperature

18:49.629 --> 18:53.174
‐ is a cool 15 degrees Celsius.
‐ What were you thinking?

18:53.174 --> 18:55.885
Times Square is the most
crowded place in the city!

18:55.885 --> 18:59.055
I know. I'm sorry. This Marlo
thing is throwing me off.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.599
So you admit
you two have a thing!

19:01.599 --> 19:04.644
No way! It's just that
I saw him with the bouquet.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.020
Why would he take it back?

19:06.020 --> 19:07.938
We'll solve that later.

19:08.814 --> 19:12.109
For now you've gotta get him
out of your head. We need you.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.819
You're right. It's Boo time!

19:13.819 --> 19:16.864
46.00. Ghost incoming.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.908
Yeah, we're going shark fishing!

19:26.957 --> 19:28.793
(Wild laugh)

19:35.049 --> 19:36.592
MYST: No!

19:39.637 --> 19:40.846
(Sniffing)

19:40.846 --> 19:42.556
Ugh!

19:43.683 --> 19:46.644
That's it! Sharks have
a super‐strong sense of smell.

19:46.644 --> 19:48.896
The ghost
can't stand nice smells.

19:54.151 --> 19:56.362
Glowboo, you distract the shark!

19:56.362 --> 19:58.698
You guys go look
for some good smells.

19:58.698 --> 20:00.616
I'll take Marlo to safety!

20:00.616 --> 20:03.828
Myst! What happened to
our mission being top priority?

20:03.828 --> 20:06.997
See?
I told you she's gaga over him!

20:06.997 --> 20:09.166
Uh, you know that "she"
can hear your whisper

20:09.166 --> 20:11.001
over our comm system right?

20:11.001 --> 20:12.169
(Embarrassed chuckle)

20:16.632 --> 20:20.386
‐ (Growls)
‐ (Sounds fearful)

20:20.386 --> 20:21.804
Ah!

20:22.763 --> 20:23.931
Move along, young man.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.600
This area's
about to become a battle zone.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.979
I know,
but it's my mom's birthday.

20:29.979 --> 20:34.525
I gotta get these flowers to
her office. It's really close!

20:34.525 --> 20:36.944
You mean those flowers
are for your mom?

20:36.944 --> 20:40.531
Er, yeah. Why?

20:40.531 --> 20:41.615
Is that a problem?

20:42.158 --> 20:45.745
Uh... Ahem!
Not at all. Swell fella.

20:45.745 --> 20:47.747
Head through there
and you'll be safe.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.419
(Sigh of relief)

20:54.837 --> 20:56.922
Now, where am I going
to find a big bouquet?

21:01.969 --> 21:03.512
(Evil laugh)

21:22.490 --> 21:25.743
I can't find anything
to throw off its sense of smell.

21:25.743 --> 21:28.996
Me neither. But I did find
some ice cream. Want some?

21:30.122 --> 21:31.791
Seriously, not a good time!

21:32.958 --> 21:34.293
Error detected.

21:35.503 --> 21:36.587
(Evil laugh)

21:39.715 --> 21:42.009
Hey! Rotten sushi!

21:43.177 --> 21:44.553
(Wild cry)

21:54.647 --> 21:56.899
Hey, sis, I could use
some backup right about now!

21:57.650 --> 21:59.902
Deliveries are free
for bulk orders.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.487
Bulk orders of what?

22:14.750 --> 22:16.085
Yeah!

22:19.171 --> 22:20.631
Octocat!

22:35.771 --> 22:36.772
Oh!

22:38.774 --> 22:40.901
Aaah!

22:57.084 --> 23:00.254
So, you broke into my locker
to take back your flowers?

23:00.254 --> 23:03.674
And I'm so, so sorry.

23:03.674 --> 23:07.761
But, well, those flowers
weren't meant for you.

23:07.761 --> 23:10.180
I mean, I really like you,
as a friend...

23:10.598 --> 23:14.184
Oh! That's a relief.
For a second I thought...

23:14.184 --> 23:17.771
‐ Anyway, yeah, we're buds.
‐ Cool!

23:20.691 --> 23:23.986
Am I dreaming
or was that a total

23:23.986 --> 23:26.030
public display of affection?

23:26.030 --> 23:29.909
In your weird dreams!
That was a friendly high‐five.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.037
It was all just
a little misunderstanding.

23:33.037 --> 23:35.831
So, a misunderstanding
that threw you off your game

23:35.831 --> 23:38.626
‐ big time, huh?
‐ Yeah. My bad.

23:38.626 --> 23:40.920
Next time I'll
set things straight immediately.

23:40.920 --> 23:43.088
Yes! I knew it!

23:43.088 --> 23:46.300
"Next time" means there <i>is</i>
something between you two!

23:46.300 --> 23:50.846
‐ (Sighs)
‐ (Laughter)
