02:01.054 --> 02:03.056
Oh, my god.

02:03.056 --> 02:09.562
What'd you
freak out for?

02:09.562 --> 02:11.564
Holy shit.

02:24.577 --> 02:26.579
Hey fac',
how you doing?

02:26.579 --> 02:27.580
How's it goin'?

02:28.081 --> 02:29.582
How you doin'?

02:29.582 --> 02:33.586
Adriana, this is
my cousin gregory,
the ambulance chaser.

02:33.586 --> 02:35.088
Nice to meet you.

02:35.588 --> 02:37.090
This is my fiancee,
amy safir.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.592
Pleasure, christopher,
to finally meet you in person.

02:39.592 --> 02:42.095
Greg's always giving me updates
on his new york cousin.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.596
We're from
jersey.

02:43.596 --> 02:46.599
My apologies,
that's the red- eye talking.

02:46.599 --> 02:49.102
Your earrings
are so excellent.

02:49.102 --> 02:50.103
Thank you.

02:50.103 --> 02:52.105
How was
your flight?

02:52.105 --> 02:53.606
Fine, good.

02:53.606 --> 02:56.109
Drink, drink, drink!

02:56.109 --> 02:59.612
Morgan stanley's
night out.

02:59.612 --> 03:02.115
Christopher said you're
here shooting a movie.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.617
That must be
so interesting.

03:04.617 --> 03:06.619
This is the first project
i brought in to jon.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.121
Who's jon?

03:08.121 --> 03:10.123
Jon favreau, she's head
of his development.

03:10.623 --> 03:11.624
I told you that.

03:11.624 --> 03:12.625
You told me
tarrantino.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.628
I worked for quentin,
he's still a friend.

03:16.129 --> 03:18.131
Anyway, favreau
snapped her right up.

03:18.631 --> 03:20.633
That movie he did,
"swingers".

03:20.633 --> 03:23.136
Vince vaughn
is so cute.

03:23.136 --> 03:26.639
So christopher,
how goes the screenplay?

03:26.639 --> 03:31.144
It's one of the best
i've ever read.

03:31.144 --> 03:34.647
Hey, easy,
okay?

03:35.148 --> 03:37.150
What's he like
in person?

03:37.150 --> 03:38.651
Incredibly funny,
smart,

03:38.651 --> 03:40.153
jon's totally
accessible.

03:40.153 --> 03:41.654
You guys should come
visit the set.

03:41.654 --> 03:43.656
No, i meant
vince vaughn.

03:43.656 --> 03:45.658
Great, great,
a friend.

03:45.658 --> 03:47.660
So, when do we get
to read this opus?

03:48.161 --> 03:50.163
I flushed it
a long time ago.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.664
Remember what i told you
on the phone?

03:52.165 --> 03:53.666
Mob theme stories
are always hot.

03:53.666 --> 03:56.169
You should've learned
to keep your mouth shut.

03:56.169 --> 03:59.172
What do you do,
adriana?

03:59.172 --> 04:05.678
Right now i'm in
the food service industry.

04:05.678 --> 04:07.680
Christopher!

04:07.680 --> 04:09.182
You, get up.

04:09.682 --> 04:10.683
Who, me?

04:10.683 --> 04:14.187
Hey, bridge and tunnel boy,
chill out.

04:23.196 --> 04:25.698
Hey, guys, let's go
to tribeca grill.

04:25.698 --> 04:27.700
It's cooler,
it's better.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.202
Why are we leaving?

04:29.202 --> 04:33.206
Just do it.

04:33.706 --> 04:36.709
She seemed so down to earth
for a hollywood person.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.211
What's with
those clothes?

04:38.211 --> 04:40.213
She in the fucking
"addams family"?

04:40.213 --> 04:42.215
That's prada!

04:42.215 --> 04:45.218
If i was greg,
i wouldn't allow it.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.220
Look at you,
you look like a fucking woman,

04:47.720 --> 04:48.721
not a bellhop.

04:48.721 --> 04:50.723
Jon favreau,
he's great!

04:50.723 --> 04:53.726
He's also a writer,
you should show him
your script.

04:54.227 --> 04:55.228
"Swingers"?

04:55.228 --> 04:59.732
He can suck my dick,
that swings, too.

05:00.233 --> 05:03.736
That acting class really
rubbed you the wrong way.

05:03.736 --> 05:06.239
I love movies, but i just
want to be a player.

05:06.239 --> 05:08.741
I don't want to fuck around
with all this other shit.

05:08.741 --> 05:09.742
So?

05:10.243 --> 05:11.744
Be a player.

05:11.744 --> 05:13.746
We'll go to the set,
she invited us!

05:13.746 --> 05:15.248
Slip him your script.

05:15.248 --> 05:18.251
That's what they call it,
slipping the script.

05:18.751 --> 05:22.255
Who knows...
you know?

05:22.755 --> 05:26.259
Would it be
so friggin' horrible
to attend a premier?

05:26.259 --> 05:27.760
I don't even
have the thing.

05:27.760 --> 05:32.765
I threw it away.

05:32.765 --> 05:34.267
What?

05:34.267 --> 05:36.269
You have a copy?

05:36.269 --> 05:38.771
Adriana, i told you,
i'm not interested.

05:39.272 --> 05:40.773
I believe in you.

05:59.792 --> 06:00.793
It wasn't my fault!

06:00.793 --> 06:02.295
You stole my car.

06:02.295 --> 06:04.297
Where's the trust
in this house?

06:04.297 --> 06:06.299
When i get confirmed
i'm gonna be a man.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.800
So how come
i can't drive?

06:07.800 --> 06:09.302
You really want
to get into this?

06:09.802 --> 06:11.804
Who was that man
that we had to pick up
at camp last year

06:12.305 --> 06:13.306
for bed wetting?

06:13.306 --> 06:14.807
That was the year
before last.

06:14.807 --> 06:16.809
You could have
killed those girls.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.811
That would've
been interesting.

06:18.811 --> 06:19.812
What?

06:19.812 --> 06:21.314
What did
you just say?

06:21.314 --> 06:23.316
Death just shows the ultimate
absurdity of life.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.817
What is this?

06:24.817 --> 06:26.819
Are you trying to get me
to lose my temper?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.322
'Cause i'm about to put yo
u through that goddamn window.

06:29.822 --> 06:31.324
See?
That's what i mean.

06:31.324 --> 06:32.825
Life is absurd.

06:33.326 --> 06:34.327
Don't say that!

06:34.327 --> 06:35.828
God forgive you!

06:35.828 --> 06:37.830
There is no god.

06:37.830 --> 06:38.831
Hey!
Hey!

06:39.332 --> 06:40.833
Where is this
coming from?

06:40.833 --> 06:42.835
They teach you this crap
at school?

06:42.835 --> 06:45.338
Is this this new
english teacher, mr. Clark?

06:45.338 --> 06:47.340
Where is
he from?

06:47.840 --> 06:49.342
Answer me!

06:49.342 --> 06:50.343
Oberlin.

06:50.343 --> 06:52.845
Want him to read something
other than "hustler"?

06:52.845 --> 06:55.848
Hello, he got assigned
"the stranger".

06:55.848 --> 06:57.850
You want him to be
an educated person?

06:57.850 --> 06:59.852
What do you think
education is? You
just make more money?

07:00.353 --> 07:01.854
This is education.

07:01.854 --> 07:04.857
Do you ever think, like,
why were we born?

07:04.857 --> 07:06.359
Madame de stael said,

07:06.859 --> 07:09.862
"in life one must choose
before boredom and suffering."

07:09.862 --> 07:14.367
Go to your room.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.369
No, i'm serious.

07:16.369 --> 07:20.873
Why were we born?

07:20.873 --> 07:23.876
We were born because of
adam and eve, that's why.

07:23.876 --> 07:26.879
Now go upstairs
and do your math.

07:26.879 --> 07:28.881
Algebra?
That's the most boring.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.883
Your other choice
is suffering.

07:30.883 --> 07:33.886
You want t
o start now?

07:34.387 --> 07:35.888
Move your ass!

07:44.897 --> 07:46.899
Jesus christ,
let me think.

07:47.400 --> 07:49.902
You wake me up,
my head's all cobwebs.

07:49.902 --> 07:53.406
Wyczchuk, wyczchuk...

07:53.406 --> 07:54.907
waldemar wyczchuk.

07:54.907 --> 07:57.410
You had lobster fra diavolo
with him in atlantic city

07:57.410 --> 07:58.911
on the 14th
of this month.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.913
He got blown up?

08:00.913 --> 08:01.914
Fuck.

08:02.415 --> 08:03.916
We're not necessarily trying
to pin this on soprano

08:03.916 --> 08:05.418
or anybody
in your crew, sal.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.420
We're drawing
no conclusions.

08:07.420 --> 08:08.921
But what do you
got for me?

08:08.921 --> 08:09.922
If i had
some coffee--

08:09.922 --> 08:11.424
cut the the quips!

08:11.424 --> 08:12.925
Tell me about
the merger talks.

08:12.925 --> 08:14.427
What do you
want me to say?

08:14.427 --> 08:16.929
Philadelphia's been putting
pressure on the shy business?

08:16.929 --> 08:19.432
That's been going on since
moses wore short pants.

08:19.432 --> 08:22.435
Tony's still resisting
the philly overtures?

08:31.944 --> 08:33.946
Sometimes, puss',
you don't act like a guy

08:33.946 --> 08:36.448
that's facing 30 to life
for selling h.

08:36.448 --> 08:37.950
Don't get heavy
with me.

08:37.950 --> 08:40.453
You come to my house
because somebody's
leaning on your ass?

08:40.453 --> 08:42.455
8:00 in the morning
you come to my house?

08:42.955 --> 08:44.457
You know what
this looks like?

08:44.457 --> 08:50.963
I'm doing all i can
to help you guys.

08:50.963 --> 08:54.467
One time tony bought
a pool table from wyczchuk.

08:59.472 --> 09:01.474
So he's sitting there
and he asks me,

09:01.974 --> 09:04.477
"if there's no god,
why was i born?"

09:04.977 --> 09:06.479
He tells me
he's got no purpose.

09:06.479 --> 09:08.481
How'd you
answer him?

09:08.481 --> 09:10.983
I told him it cost
about 150 grand
to bring him up so far,

09:10.983 --> 09:13.486
so if he's got no purpose
i want a fucking refund.

09:13.986 --> 09:15.988
Are you angry with anthony jr.
About the car?

09:15.988 --> 09:17.990
You can't put shit
back on the donkey.

09:17.990 --> 09:19.492
Boys will be boys.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.494
It's this other crap,
that's not normal.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.997
Adolescent angst
is very normal.

09:24.997 --> 09:26.999
You never
went through it?

09:27.500 --> 09:30.002
You think my mother and father
are gonna stand for that shit?

09:30.002 --> 09:33.005
How is
your mother?

09:33.005 --> 09:39.011
She's dead to me.

09:39.011 --> 09:42.014
And how's anthony jr.
Been taking it?

09:42.014 --> 09:44.016
What?
About the family?

09:44.016 --> 09:47.019
About your nonrelationship
with his grandmother.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.522
How's he supposed to
understand that?

09:49.522 --> 09:51.023
And in general,

09:51.023 --> 09:54.026
the whole strain of
the current atmosphere
in your household?

09:54.026 --> 09:56.529
But that don't give him
the right to mouth off.

09:56.529 --> 09:59.031
Sounds to me like
anthony jr.

09:59.031 --> 10:02.034
May have stumbled
onto existentialism.

10:02.034 --> 10:03.536
Fucking internet.

10:03.536 --> 10:06.038
No, it's
a european philosophy.

10:06.038 --> 10:07.540
After world war ii,

10:08.040 --> 10:09.542
people were
disillusioned

10:10.042 --> 10:12.545
by the sheer weight
of the horrors.

10:12.545 --> 10:15.047
That's when
the whole idea took root

10:15.047 --> 10:18.050
that there were
no absolute truths.

10:18.050 --> 10:19.552
You believe that?

10:19.552 --> 10:21.053
In your family,

10:21.053 --> 10:23.556
even motherhood
is up for debate.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.057
No, it's not,

10:25.057 --> 10:27.059
i teach him to
love and respect
and appreciate his mother.

10:27.059 --> 10:31.564
What about
your mother?

10:31.564 --> 10:34.567
Anthony, i think it's important
we talk about your mother

10:35.067 --> 10:36.569
and what she tried
to do to you.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.070
Don't need to.

10:38.070 --> 10:45.077
She showed her true colors,
that's all.

10:45.077 --> 10:48.080
Has anthony jr. Heard you say
"she's dead to me"?

10:48.080 --> 10:49.582
I don't know.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.584
Don't you think
that kind of talk

10:52.084 --> 10:55.087
could lead a kid
to embrace these ideas?

10:55.087 --> 10:57.089
Oh, so, now
this is my fault.

10:57.089 --> 11:01.093
When some people first realize
that they're solely responsible

11:01.093 --> 11:04.597
for their decisions,
actions, and beliefs,

11:04.597 --> 11:07.600
and that death lies
at the end of every road,

11:07.600 --> 11:11.103
they can be overcome
with intense dread.

11:11.103 --> 11:13.105
"Intense dread."

11:13.105 --> 11:15.107
A dull, aching anger

11:15.107 --> 11:17.109
that leads them
to conclude

11:17.109 --> 11:21.113
that the only
absolute truth is death.

11:27.119 --> 11:29.121
I think the kid's
onto something.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.629
It's puttin' me off,
way off.

11:37.129 --> 11:38.631
Okay, ready?
Ready to go?

11:38.631 --> 11:40.633
Okay, picture's up,
lock it up!

11:40.633 --> 11:42.134
Ready to roll,
wait.

11:42.134 --> 11:44.637
Standby to roll,
quiet please!

11:44.637 --> 11:46.138
Roll sound!

11:46.138 --> 11:47.640
Camera!

11:47.640 --> 11:50.142
Smoke out,
camera's rolling!

11:50.142 --> 11:52.144
And, action!

11:52.144 --> 11:55.147
My leg,
i think it's broken.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.649
Okay, cut!

11:56.649 --> 11:58.150
Alright,
check the gate.

11:58.150 --> 12:01.153
Michele,
can i talk to you?

12:01.654 --> 12:03.155
C'mon.

12:03.155 --> 12:05.157
Holy shit,
that's...

12:05.157 --> 12:07.159
she was in
"kings of comedy".

12:07.660 --> 12:09.161
And the other one, too,
i seen her.

12:09.161 --> 12:11.664
That movie my girlfriend likes
with uma, what's her name?

12:11.664 --> 12:15.668
Jon,
this is christopher.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.169
Hey,
how's it going?

12:17.169 --> 12:18.671
It's a real treat
to meet you.

12:18.671 --> 12:19.672
"Swingers"
kicked ass.

12:20.172 --> 12:21.173
Thanks,
thank you.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.676
Thanks for coming out here,
i appreciate it, seriously.

12:24.176 --> 12:27.680
What were you doing
before you started
writing for "los angeles"?

12:27.680 --> 12:31.183
Jon, this is
christopher.

12:31.684 --> 12:33.686
Oh, oh, i'm sorry,
i thought you--

12:34.186 --> 12:36.689
there's a guy from
"los angeles" magazine
coming down here

12:36.689 --> 12:39.692
to do a story on
my favorite place
for breakfast.

12:39.692 --> 12:43.195
But you're the guy
from jersey, right?

12:43.696 --> 12:44.697
Yeah.

12:44.697 --> 12:45.698
Cool.

12:45.698 --> 12:47.199
Very, very cool.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.702
Michele foreman,
our director,

12:49.702 --> 12:52.204
she's from jersey,
you see her first picture?

12:52.705 --> 12:53.706
She's a director?

12:54.206 --> 12:55.708
Beautiful film,

12:55.708 --> 12:57.710
it won the audience award
at sundance.

12:57.710 --> 12:58.711
Madonn'.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.212
It was also
hilariously funny,

13:00.212 --> 13:02.214
this lesbian- romantic
screwball comedy she did.

13:02.214 --> 13:04.717
This one's much
more mainstream,
it's about spies.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.219
So, anyway, we're getting ready
to shoot the last scene.

13:07.219 --> 13:08.721
This is the one where

13:08.721 --> 13:11.223
the two lesbians,
the lovers, they die.

13:11.223 --> 13:13.225
Janeane,
her character's
zephyr--

13:13.726 --> 13:14.727
that's her
fucking name.

13:14.727 --> 13:16.228
Garofalo!
Janeane garofalo.

13:16.729 --> 13:20.232
Yeah, so she's been
chasing gina, sandra,

13:20.232 --> 13:21.233
all around
the country.

13:21.734 --> 13:22.735
Gina?

13:22.735 --> 13:24.737
Gina shecter from brooklyn,
that's the character.

13:25.237 --> 13:26.238
So they end up
here in soho

13:26.238 --> 13:28.240
where they just had a standoff,
they shot each other.

13:28.741 --> 13:30.242
Picture's up,
let's lock it up!

13:30.242 --> 13:31.744
Quiet please!

13:31.744 --> 13:32.745
Excuse me.

13:32.745 --> 13:34.246
And smoke!

13:34.246 --> 13:35.748
Standby, to roll,
quiet please!

13:36.248 --> 13:38.250
And roll sound!

13:38.250 --> 13:40.753
The silencers underscore their
voiceless place in society.

13:40.753 --> 13:44.757
We're rolling!

13:44.757 --> 13:47.259
We're rolling!

13:47.760 --> 13:49.762
Camera's rolling!

13:49.762 --> 13:51.764
Spin the wheel!

13:51.764 --> 13:57.770
And action!

13:57.770 --> 13:59.772
I never had
an eggcream.

14:00.272 --> 14:02.775
They're not coming
for either one of us.

14:02.775 --> 14:05.277
You live your
whole life in a place

14:05.277 --> 14:08.280
and never taste the thing
it's famous for.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.783
Couldn't hear the fucking shots
with this thing.

14:11.283 --> 14:13.285
There's a plac
e on st. Mark's--

14:13.285 --> 14:14.787
it's over,
you bitch.

14:15.287 --> 14:18.290
Don't do it.

14:18.290 --> 14:19.291
Michele!

14:19.792 --> 14:21.794
Cut, i'm sorry,
i'm sorry, sorry, sorry.

14:22.294 --> 14:23.295
Can we cut
for a second?

14:23.796 --> 14:25.798
Are we really
gonna say "bitch"?

14:25.798 --> 14:27.299
You don't like
"bitch"?

14:27.299 --> 14:29.301
We discussed this,
we're losing light.

14:29.301 --> 14:30.803
It's not that
i don't like it.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.805
It's just, it's the last thing
my lover says to me?

14:32.805 --> 14:34.306
I don't find it
particularly interesting.

14:34.306 --> 14:35.808
You're thinking you should
shoot her again?

14:36.308 --> 14:37.309
No, wait a minute--

14:37.309 --> 14:38.811
i don't think shooting's
right in this case.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.813
Your character's strength
is her passivity.

14:40.813 --> 14:41.814
Whose passivity?

14:41.814 --> 14:42.815
Zephyr.

14:42.815 --> 14:43.816
In this case.

14:43.816 --> 14:44.817
In this case.

14:45.317 --> 14:46.819
I think he's right,
janeane.

14:46.819 --> 14:48.320
Obviously, throughout
the rest of the piece,

14:48.320 --> 14:50.322
you got testes
to burn.

14:50.322 --> 14:52.825
Is there anything
other than "bitch"?

14:52.825 --> 14:55.327
Buchiach.

14:55.327 --> 14:57.329
What?

14:57.830 --> 15:01.834
Let that one call
that one "buchiach".

15:01.834 --> 15:03.836
That sounds
more interesting.

15:03.836 --> 15:07.840
Bu--
what?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.341
Buchiach.

15:09.341 --> 15:11.343
If she's
from brooklyn...

15:11.844 --> 15:13.846
that sounds okay.

15:14.346 --> 15:15.848
Okay,
let's roll.

15:15.848 --> 15:17.349
What does
it mean?

15:17.349 --> 15:18.350
Cunt.

15:18.350 --> 15:20.853
Cunt,
i like that.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.855
Okay, picture's up
, let's lock it up!

15:23.355 --> 15:24.356
Standby to roll!

15:24.356 --> 15:25.858
Roll sound!

15:25.858 --> 15:27.860
Camera's rolling!

15:27.860 --> 15:29.361
We are rolling!

15:29.862 --> 15:36.368
Smoke!

15:36.368 --> 15:37.369
We're rolling!

15:37.870 --> 15:39.371
Smoke out!

15:39.872 --> 15:47.880
And action!

15:47.880 --> 15:50.382
What's going on
with you?

15:50.382 --> 15:51.884
Nothing.

15:51.884 --> 15:53.385
"Nothing."

15:53.385 --> 15:55.387
You know,
that "no god" shit,

15:55.387 --> 15:57.389
that upset your mother
very much.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.392
It's not "no god",
it's just god is dead.

16:00.392 --> 16:01.894
Who said that?

16:01.894 --> 16:04.396
Nitch, he's a 19th century
philosopher from germany.

16:04.396 --> 16:07.900
Anyway, that's why
i'm not getting confirmed.

16:07.900 --> 16:08.901
Enough with that shit.

16:09.401 --> 16:10.903
Your confirmation's
this weekend

16:10.903 --> 16:12.404
and you are
getting confirmed.

16:12.905 --> 16:13.906
That sucks my nut.

16:13.906 --> 16:14.907
Hey!

16:15.407 --> 16:16.909
You got a lot of balls,
you know that?

16:16.909 --> 16:19.411
You go to catholic school
and your mother wants it.

16:19.411 --> 16:20.913
What does she know?

16:20.913 --> 16:22.414
She knows that
even if god is dead,

16:22.414 --> 16:25.417
you're still gonna
kiss his ass.

16:25.417 --> 16:30.923
Hey!

16:30.923 --> 16:32.424
Hey, joe.

16:32.424 --> 16:33.926
Hey, chris,
how's it going?

16:33.926 --> 16:34.927
Coke and a slice.

16:35.427 --> 16:36.929
It's the best pie
in north jersey.

16:36.929 --> 16:39.431
What do you guys want?
Anything, it's taken care of.

16:39.431 --> 16:40.933
Same thing,
coke and a slice.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.434
Coke and
a slice.

16:42.434 --> 16:43.936
You got it.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.437
That laundromat
across the street,

16:45.437 --> 16:47.940
that's where joe's
restaurant used to be.

16:47.940 --> 16:49.942
Willie moretti,
that's where he bought it.

16:49.942 --> 16:53.445
Moretti was sinatra's
guardian angel, right?

16:53.946 --> 16:55.948
Stuck his gun
in tommy dorsey's mouth

16:56.448 --> 16:58.951
and bought sinatra's contract
from him for a dollar.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.452
Fuck,
that's so cool.

17:00.452 --> 17:01.954
That's like the inspiration
for johnny fontaine

17:01.954 --> 17:03.455
and the studio bos
s in gf one, right?

17:03.956 --> 17:04.957
Right.

17:04.957 --> 17:07.459
That's the one beef
i had with "swingers".

17:07.459 --> 17:09.962
You guys patterned yourselves
after frank and dean,

17:10.462 --> 17:15.968
but there was like
a pussy- assness to it.

17:15.968 --> 17:19.471
I mean, it was kind of
the point of the piece--

17:19.471 --> 17:22.473
so, you brought us
your script.

17:22.473 --> 17:23.474
Yeah, but--

17:23.976 --> 17:24.977
c'mon,
let's see it.

17:24.977 --> 17:26.478
No, you're
jon favreau.

17:26.478 --> 17:28.981
Rocky marciano,
"deep impact",
"swingers".

17:29.481 --> 17:30.482
Here's the thing.

17:30.482 --> 17:31.984
Your script
is set in the world

17:31.984 --> 17:34.486
that i'm interested in
doing my next project on.

17:34.486 --> 17:36.488
A picture on the life
of crazy joe gallo.

17:36.488 --> 17:37.990
Joe gallo?

17:37.990 --> 17:40.492
They already did "the gang that
couldn't shoot straight".

17:40.492 --> 17:42.494
Yeah, but i see gallo
as this tragic figure.

17:42.494 --> 17:43.996
He was a flawed
and blinkered guy,

17:44.496 --> 17:46.498
but he wanted
to learn, to grow,

17:46.999 --> 17:48.500
to read, to paint.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.503
He had this yearning,
this hunger for--

17:51.503 --> 17:54.506
fuck your mother,
what's the word?

17:54.506 --> 17:58.510
You as joey gallo,
i don't see that.

17:59.011 --> 18:00.512
I'm part italian.

18:00.512 --> 18:04.516
Vince, maybe,
vaughn.

18:04.516 --> 18:08.020
This project happens to be
a personal passion of mine.

18:08.520 --> 18:09.521
I could play
joey gallo

18:09.521 --> 18:12.024
but i don't want to be an actor
unless i can play myself.

18:12.024 --> 18:14.526
Which is totally
understandable.

18:14.526 --> 18:16.028
Listen, ever since amy
told me about you,

18:16.028 --> 18:17.529
i thought maybe
we could work together.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.531
You could tell me
the way shit goes down,

18:19.531 --> 18:21.533
what makes sense,
what people really say,

18:21.533 --> 18:23.535
you know
what i mean?

18:23.535 --> 18:26.038
Joey gallo, i was
like three years old
when he got whacked.

18:26.538 --> 18:27.539
Yeah, but
speech patterns.

18:27.539 --> 18:29.041
You saw "swingers".

18:29.041 --> 18:30.542
Whatever you think
of that motherfucker, man,

18:30.542 --> 18:33.045
it's, like, you can tell
it's extremely important to me

18:33.545 --> 18:35.047
how people
really talk.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.548
Like that
"buchiach" thing.

18:36.548 --> 18:38.050
How could i forget
that fucking thing?

18:38.050 --> 18:40.052
I mean, i grew up
right in queens.

18:40.052 --> 18:42.554
I guess it is
a long time ago.

18:42.554 --> 18:47.059
You wouldn't be betraying
any oath thing.

18:47.059 --> 18:50.562
Holy fucking shit,
that thing is still alive?

18:51.063 --> 18:55.067
If i told you 15 years ago
that she was a piece of ass,

18:55.067 --> 18:57.069
would you
believe me?

18:57.069 --> 18:57.569
What?

18:58.070 --> 18:59.071
What happened?

18:59.071 --> 19:00.572
Forget it.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.575
C'mon, man,
we're just talking.

19:03.575 --> 19:07.079
Wise- guy friend of mine would
kill me if he knew i told you.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.086
This made guy, right?

19:14.086 --> 19:16.588
Had the most discriminating eye
when it comes to t&a.

19:17.089 --> 19:20.092
He's at a club one night,
this broad's all over him.

19:20.592 --> 19:22.094
And she's got
a really nice body,

19:22.594 --> 19:23.595
she's horny as hell.

19:24.096 --> 19:27.099
They step outside,
they walk over to this
picnic ground.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.601
She starts blowing him
next to this swing set.

19:30.102 --> 19:32.604
He's about
to shoot his load,

19:32.604 --> 19:34.606
he reaches down
to start fingering,

19:35.107 --> 19:37.109
undoes the skirt,
reaches in,

19:37.609 --> 19:39.611
grabs hold
of a goddamn prick.

19:39.611 --> 19:40.612
Jesus christ.

19:41.113 --> 19:42.114
"Crying game."

19:42.614 --> 19:45.117
This is
a true story.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.619
So my friend can't
let this story get out.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.622
He wants to humiliate the freak
as much as he was humiliated.

19:51.123 --> 19:54.126
So he gets this fucking acid,
you know, burns everything.

19:54.126 --> 19:57.629
He pours it on her arms,
on her face, everywhere,

19:57.629 --> 20:00.632
her prick.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.634
That's one
bad motherfucker.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.636
That's how good looking
this broad used to look,

20:05.137 --> 20:07.639
had this wise- guy friend
of mine totally fooled.

20:07.639 --> 20:09.141
She had to get
a glass eye.

20:18.650 --> 20:24.656
Hey, look
who's here.

20:24.656 --> 20:27.159
You can't say hello
to your uncle?

20:27.159 --> 20:28.660
Hey, uncle pussy.

20:28.660 --> 20:31.663
Look what my little friend
did to carmela's car.

20:31.663 --> 20:33.165
What were
you thinking?

20:33.665 --> 20:36.168
You got to learn to respect
the value of things.

20:36.168 --> 20:37.169
This is
your own property.

20:37.669 --> 20:43.175
Here,
go get a soda.

20:43.175 --> 20:45.677
The longest fuckin
g car ride of my life.

20:45.677 --> 20:47.179
What's the matter?

20:47.179 --> 20:49.681
It's the kid,
he used to be happy- go- lucky.

20:49.681 --> 20:51.183
Now he's moody,
he questions the universe.

20:51.183 --> 20:52.684
Like father,
like son.

20:52.684 --> 20:54.686
Fuck you,
i'm serious.

20:54.686 --> 20:56.688
You're his
confirmation sponsor.

20:57.189 --> 20:58.690
Do something
with him.

20:58.690 --> 21:00.192
Alright, alright.

21:00.192 --> 21:01.693
But 13, 14,
they start getting broody.

21:01.693 --> 21:04.196
It's getting so i don't
want to be with him.

21:04.196 --> 21:06.198
If you gotta use a belt,
go ahead.

21:06.198 --> 21:07.699
He's bombing out
in school.

21:07.699 --> 21:10.202
He got a "c",
three "ds" and an "f".

21:10.202 --> 21:12.204
Look at this kid.

21:12.704 --> 21:14.206
How you making out
in school?

21:14.206 --> 21:16.708
I got a "c",
three "ds" and an "f".

21:38.230 --> 21:39.731
Hey.

21:39.731 --> 21:41.733
Where you been?

21:41.733 --> 21:43.735
I was hanging out
with jon.

21:43.735 --> 21:44.736
Izzacupo?

21:44.736 --> 21:47.239
Favreau.

21:47.239 --> 21:50.242
You were?

21:50.242 --> 21:52.244
You went
to the set?

21:52.244 --> 21:53.745
Yeah.

21:53.745 --> 21:55.247
Why didn't
you call?

21:55.247 --> 21:57.249
We were only there
for like half an hour,

21:57.249 --> 21:58.750
then him and amy
wanted me to give them

21:59.251 --> 22:01.253
kind of like
a tour around jersey.

22:01.253 --> 22:06.758
They did?

22:07.259 --> 22:08.260
What?

22:08.760 --> 22:11.763
Vince vaughn didn't
come down there.

22:17.769 --> 22:20.272
Elbow up, matt,
keep it straight.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.274
Coach is having
me pull more.

22:22.274 --> 22:23.775
Fuck him.

22:23.775 --> 22:25.777
My son don't hit
sacrifice flies.

22:26.278 --> 22:27.279
You're up next.

22:27.779 --> 22:29.781
Nah, i just want
to want watch.

22:30.282 --> 22:32.284
You got to snap
out of this, anthony.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.286
C'mon, a. J. ,
it's fun.

22:34.286 --> 22:36.288
I know, i just
don't feel like it.

22:36.788 --> 22:39.791
Sometimes you got to do things
you don't want to.

22:39.791 --> 22:41.293
Why?

22:41.293 --> 22:43.295
'Cause your parents
say so.

22:43.295 --> 22:44.796
It's part
of your tradition.

22:45.297 --> 22:46.798
Baseball's not
part of my tradition.

22:46.798 --> 22:48.300
It ain't?

22:48.300 --> 22:49.801
Your dad,
in high school,

22:49.801 --> 22:51.303
was almost all- county
left field.

22:51.303 --> 22:54.306
I'm not talking about that,
i'm talking about
your confirmation here.

22:54.306 --> 22:55.807
I don't want
to get confirmed.

22:55.807 --> 22:57.309
Why not?

22:57.309 --> 22:58.810
Don't matter
why not.

22:58.810 --> 23:00.312
If you're looking
for a purpose in life,

23:00.312 --> 23:02.314
doing what's right
is your purpose.

23:02.314 --> 23:03.815
That's not what
nitch says.

23:04.316 --> 23:04.816
Who?

23:04.816 --> 23:05.817
Nietzsche.

23:05.817 --> 23:07.319
Let me tell you
something.

23:07.319 --> 23:10.822
Nietzsche wound up
talking to his horse.

23:10.822 --> 23:12.324
And i know what
you're gonna tell me.

23:12.324 --> 23:14.326
Sartre, right?

23:14.326 --> 23:16.828
Sartre was
a fucking fraud.

23:16.828 --> 23:19.331
He copped it all
from husserl and heidegger.

23:19.831 --> 23:24.336
Go on.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.838
You should start
at the beginning.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.841
Take a look
at kierkegaard.

23:29.841 --> 23:31.343
Whatever.

23:31.343 --> 23:36.348
Kierkegaard said,"every duty
is essentially duty to god."

23:36.348 --> 23:38.850
"Nigga be a leader,
not a follower."

23:38.850 --> 23:39.851
What?

23:39.851 --> 23:41.353
Master p said that.

23:41.353 --> 23:43.355
You still
listen to rap?

23:43.355 --> 23:44.356
Why?

23:44.356 --> 23:47.359
It's just all about
marketing now.

24:01.873 --> 24:03.875
Hi, welcome to
soho grand.

24:04.376 --> 24:05.877
I'm here to see
jon favreau.

24:06.378 --> 24:07.879
One moment, please.

24:07.879 --> 24:10.382
Whom may i say
is calling?

24:10.382 --> 24:12.884
Jerry from newark,
he's expecting me.

24:13.385 --> 24:16.888
I'm sorry, sir, mr. Favreau
requested not to be disturbed.

24:16.888 --> 24:18.890
Tell him his 2:00 pm
is waiting.

24:18.890 --> 24:22.894
He has his telephone programmed
so as to not be disturbed.

24:22.894 --> 24:24.896
It's 2:00 in
the fucking afternoon.

24:24.896 --> 24:29.401
Would you care
to leave a message?

24:29.401 --> 24:33.405
Would you you see if
amy safir is in?

24:33.405 --> 24:35.407
Hey.

24:35.407 --> 24:37.409
What you
doing here?

24:37.409 --> 24:39.411
I was supposed to be meeting
jon to discuss my script

24:39.911 --> 24:41.413
but now he's got
the "do not disturb" on.

24:41.913 --> 24:44.416
Yeah, shooting ran late,
we didn't wrap till 5:30.

24:44.416 --> 24:48.420
C'mon in.

24:48.420 --> 24:51.423
I brought him jersey's
best sangweech,

24:51.423 --> 24:52.924
fucking best
in the world.

24:53.425 --> 24:54.426
That was very nice.

24:54.926 --> 24:55.927
You want it?

24:55.927 --> 24:57.429
Oh, no thanks,
i brushed my teeth.

24:57.929 --> 24:59.931
Here,
have a seat.

24:59.931 --> 25:01.433
You want
some coffee?

25:01.433 --> 25:04.436
No, i can't stay,
i got business to take care of.

25:09.941 --> 25:12.444
If they ever knew
i was into this.

25:12.944 --> 25:14.946
What i'm saying is...

25:14.946 --> 25:17.449
this kind of thing
is unacceptable
where i come from.

25:17.449 --> 25:20.952
Do you know if he read
my script yet?

25:20.952 --> 25:21.953
I have your script.

25:22.454 --> 25:23.455
What?

25:23.455 --> 25:24.956
Jon asked me to give it
an official read.

25:25.457 --> 25:28.460
Don't take it personally,
it's his process.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.962
Billy bob wrote something
he wanted to do with jon

25:30.962 --> 25:32.464
and jon had me
read it first.

25:33.465 --> 25:34.466
Hello.

25:34.966 --> 25:36.968
Hey, honey,
your cousin's here.

25:36.968 --> 25:39.971
Yeah, that's right,
the screenwriter.

25:39.971 --> 25:41.973
Okay, i will.

25:41.973 --> 25:43.975
Gregory says,
"go fuck yourself".

25:43.975 --> 25:46.978
Union square cafe?
Okay.

25:46.978 --> 25:49.981
Alright, i'll
see you there, bye.

25:50.482 --> 25:53.485
What did you
think about it?

25:53.485 --> 25:54.986
About what?

25:54.986 --> 25:56.488
My script.

25:56.488 --> 25:58.990
I love movies,
i started with the dialogue,

25:58.990 --> 26:00.492
but then you gotta
find the conflict

26:00.992 --> 26:02.994
and tell the story
in picture arcs.

26:02.994 --> 26:06.998
I think it's--
it's got some real heart.

26:06.998 --> 26:09.000
Some good
raw emotion in it.

26:09.000 --> 26:10.502
You should probably
try and finish it.

26:10.502 --> 26:13.004
Yeah, i hit
a fucking wall.

26:13.004 --> 26:14.506
Third act shit.

26:14.506 --> 26:17.509
Vicki king, in "21 days
to how to write a movie in",

26:18.009 --> 26:19.511
she says that's
not uncommon.

26:19.511 --> 26:22.514
These aren't third
act problems, they're
in the second act.

26:22.514 --> 26:24.516
Get the fuck
out of here.

26:24.516 --> 26:30.021
See, you ended right here
in the middle of page 83.

26:30.021 --> 26:33.525
Yeah, this sentence
could've gone either way.

26:33.525 --> 26:36.528
See...
when frankie says,

26:36.528 --> 26:38.530
"i don't know whether
to shit or go blind",

26:38.530 --> 26:41.533
he's at a crossroads,
he doesn't know.

26:41.533 --> 26:43.535
That's an
expression, right?

26:43.535 --> 26:46.037
Like a joke,
"shit or go blind".

26:46.037 --> 26:48.540
Well, no,
'cause later on

26:48.540 --> 26:50.041
his father gets
that cancer of the eye.

26:50.542 --> 26:52.043
What do they call that,
glaucoma?

26:52.043 --> 26:53.545
Whatever the fuck,
runs in the family.

26:54.045 --> 26:55.547
They have to get him
a guide dog.

26:55.547 --> 26:57.549
Oh.

26:57.549 --> 27:02.053
But the third act
starts at page 90.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.556
I'm not in the third
fucking act yet.

27:04.556 --> 27:07.058
You're inciting incident
doesn't happen till page 12,

27:07.058 --> 27:09.060
it should be
on page three.

27:09.060 --> 27:11.062
I knew that arc shit
fucked me up.

27:11.062 --> 27:14.065
I tried making it
all these three dimensions
like she said.

27:14.065 --> 27:20.071
Here, sit,
i'll show you.

27:20.071 --> 27:21.072
Okay.

27:21.573 --> 27:23.575
See,
i was thinking...

27:23.575 --> 27:26.077
if you take the scene
where rocco

27:26.077 --> 27:28.079
is fucking the two
asian strippers.

27:28.079 --> 27:29.581
That's a plot point.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.082
I know, i know.

27:31.082 --> 27:32.584
But my question is,
what's at stake?

27:32.584 --> 27:34.586
The jeopardy's
unclear.

27:34.586 --> 27:35.587
What jeopardy?

27:35.587 --> 27:38.590
There's a seven part
hierarchy of human needs

27:38.590 --> 27:42.594
that explains and
clarifies what drives us.

27:43.094 --> 27:47.098
Starting with
the basic needs
like food

27:47.098 --> 27:48.600
and water.

27:48.600 --> 27:51.102
So you like
my script?

27:51.102 --> 27:53.605
It's very good,
christopher.

27:54.105 --> 27:58.109
You want me to tell you
what all seven are?

27:58.109 --> 27:59.611
Seven what?

27:59.611 --> 28:01.613
The human needs.

28:01.613 --> 28:03.114
Yeah.

28:03.114 --> 28:05.116
Survival.

28:05.116 --> 28:05.617
Yeah.

28:06.117 --> 28:08.119
Safety and security.

28:08.119 --> 28:09.621
Yeah.

28:09.621 --> 28:14.125
The need
to understand.

29:13.184 --> 29:19.190
Hi grandma.

29:19.190 --> 29:20.191
Grandma?

29:20.191 --> 29:21.192
Who is it?

29:21.192 --> 29:22.694
You woke me.

29:22.694 --> 29:25.196
It's me,
anthony jr.

29:25.196 --> 29:29.200
I didn't know
i had a grandson.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.202
I miss you.

29:31.202 --> 29:33.204
Yeah,
you should.

29:33.204 --> 29:35.206
You never
come see me.

29:35.206 --> 29:36.708
I've been busy.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.209
Everybody's busy.

29:38.209 --> 29:40.211
And don't lie to me.

29:40.211 --> 29:43.214
I know your father forbids
your coming down here.

29:43.214 --> 29:45.216
He doesn't,
honest.

29:45.216 --> 29:47.719
He just doesn't want us to
talk about you in the house.

29:47.719 --> 29:51.222
You can go
shit in his hat.

29:51.723 --> 29:54.726
He's mad at me
right now.

29:54.726 --> 29:57.228
I shouldn't use
that kind of talk.

29:57.228 --> 30:00.732
Don't let me ever catch you
talking that way.

30:01.232 --> 30:03.735
Now what did
you do bad?

30:03.735 --> 30:06.738
My dad doesn't
like my attitude.

30:06.738 --> 30:08.740
So uncle pussy said that
i should come talk to you

30:08.740 --> 30:13.244
because you're old and
have wisdom and stuff.

30:13.244 --> 30:15.747
His mother's
another one.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.749
Well, what'd
you do?

30:18.249 --> 30:21.252
I took mom's car out of
the garage and it got wrecked.

30:21.252 --> 30:23.254
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

30:23.254 --> 30:25.757
Was it bad?

30:25.757 --> 30:27.759
Uncle pussy
already fixed it.

30:27.759 --> 30:29.260
Did you wear
your safety belt?

30:29.260 --> 30:30.762
Yeah.

30:30.762 --> 30:33.264
Because there was an article
in the paper the other day

30:33.264 --> 30:35.266
about a bunch
of teen- agers

30:35.266 --> 30:37.268
from out near
the delaware water gap.

30:37.268 --> 30:40.772
They overcrowded their car,
it hit a tree,

30:40.772 --> 30:42.774
and it incinerated.

30:42.774 --> 30:44.776
And they got trapped.

30:45.276 --> 30:48.279
People could
hear'em screaming,
they couldn't get out.

30:48.279 --> 30:52.283
The safety belts did it,
buckled them in.

30:52.283 --> 30:53.785
See, that'
s what i mean.

30:53.785 --> 30:55.286
What's the purpose?

30:55.286 --> 30:56.788
Of what?

30:57.288 --> 30:59.791
Being...
here on our planet.

30:59.791 --> 31:02.293
Earth.

31:02.293 --> 31:04.295
Those kids
are dead meat.

31:04.295 --> 31:05.797
What's the use?

31:06.297 --> 31:07.298
What's the purpose?

31:07.799 --> 31:10.301
Why does everything
have to have a purpose?

31:10.301 --> 31:11.803
The world is a jungle.

31:11.803 --> 31:14.305
If you want my advice,
anthony,

31:14.806 --> 31:18.309
don't expect happiness,
you won't get it,

31:18.309 --> 31:20.311
people let you down.

31:20.311 --> 31:22.313
And i'm not
naming any names,

31:22.313 --> 31:30.822
but in the end,
you die in your own arms.

31:30.822 --> 31:34.325
You mean alone?

31:34.325 --> 31:36.327
It's all
a big nothing.

31:36.327 --> 31:39.330
What what makes you think
you're so special?

31:47.338 --> 31:52.844
Guess i won't order us
any espresso.

31:52.844 --> 31:54.846
I took an
acting class once.

31:54.846 --> 31:56.848
Oh, yeah?
How'd that go for you?

31:56.848 --> 31:58.850
But i didn't
need it.

31:58.850 --> 31:59.851
Oh, yeah.

32:00.351 --> 32:01.853
I figured out
as far as movies go,

32:02.353 --> 32:03.855
i want to be a player,
not an actor.

32:03.855 --> 32:05.356
Smart man,
like bugsy.

32:05.356 --> 32:07.859
That was another thing
that kind of blew
about "swingers".

32:07.859 --> 32:09.360
The acting?

32:09.360 --> 32:11.362
You know what's
good fucking acting?

32:11.362 --> 32:13.364
Hanks,
"private ryan".

32:13.364 --> 32:15.366
"Earn it."

32:15.366 --> 32:16.868
It's kind of unfai
r to compare the two.

32:16.868 --> 32:19.871
One's about young soldiers
dying on the beach
at normandy,

32:19.871 --> 32:22.874
the other one's about
young guy's lookin' for
blow jobs in vegas.

32:22.874 --> 32:26.377
Well, you made
the movie.

32:26.377 --> 32:28.379
So...

32:28.880 --> 32:30.882
listen...

32:31.382 --> 32:36.888
you mind if
i ask you something?

32:36.888 --> 32:42.894
You strapped
right now?

32:42.894 --> 32:45.396
Strapped, huh?

32:45.396 --> 32:48.399
Yeah.

32:48.399 --> 32:48.900
Fuck.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.402
Jesus fucking christ!

32:51.402 --> 32:52.904
Watch out, man.

32:52.904 --> 32:54.906
Holy fuck.

32:55.406 --> 32:58.910
Can i ask you
something else?

32:58.910 --> 33:00.411
That's what
i'm here for, jon.

33:00.411 --> 33:02.914
It will not leave this room,
i swear to you.

33:02.914 --> 33:04.916
Have you ever-- ?

33:05.416 --> 33:06.918
Have i ever what?

33:07.418 --> 33:08.419
C'mon, you know.

33:08.419 --> 33:09.921
No, what?

33:09.921 --> 33:12.423
I'm not gonna answer
unless you ask.

33:12.924 --> 33:15.927
That's cool, man,
i'm sorry.

33:15.927 --> 33:17.929
No, c'mon,
you can ask me.

33:17.929 --> 33:18.930
No, it's cool.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.431
Oh, c'mon.

33:20.431 --> 33:22.433
C'mon, rocky,
c'mon, rocky!

33:22.433 --> 33:23.935
C'mon, ask me.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.436
Did i what,
did i what?

33:25.937 --> 33:27.438
Have i
ever what?

33:27.438 --> 33:29.440
It's cool,
just take it back.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.442
What, this?

33:31.442 --> 33:32.944
I think
the safety's on.

33:33.444 --> 33:36.447
Here we go,
you're money.

33:36.447 --> 33:38.950
Did i ever what,
did i ever what?

33:38.950 --> 33:44.455
What?

33:44.455 --> 33:46.457
That's not cool, man.

33:46.457 --> 33:47.959
I got dialogue
tomorrow.

33:47.959 --> 33:51.963
If my voice gets scratchy,
it's not cool.

33:51.963 --> 33:58.469
What'd you think
of my script?

33:58.469 --> 33:58.970
Well...

33:59.470 --> 34:00.972
you know,
like, frankie?

34:00.972 --> 34:03.975
I know frankie,
he's my fucking
leading man.

34:03.975 --> 34:05.977
He's...

34:05.977 --> 34:12.984
he's kind of like
a contradictory character.

34:12.984 --> 34:19.489
In a good way,
you know, like complex.

34:19.489 --> 34:22.493
You think he should wear
those taps on his shoes?

34:22.493 --> 34:24.495
That's the questio
n i was gonna ask you.

34:24.495 --> 34:26.998
They sound cool,
they're his trademark.

34:26.998 --> 34:28.498
But in the hit
against rocco,

34:28.498 --> 34:30.501
somebody's gonna hear him
walking on the roof.

34:30.501 --> 34:32.003
That's a problem.

34:32.003 --> 34:33.504
What i was
thinking was,

34:33.504 --> 34:37.507
in this script,
in all scripts, really,

34:37.507 --> 34:42.013
it begs to show more
of the author in it.

34:42.013 --> 34:44.514
Your life,
your vision.

34:44.514 --> 34:51.022
The roof
is soft tar!

34:51.022 --> 34:52.023
That'll work.

34:52.023 --> 34:54.025
The roof
is soft tar!

34:54.025 --> 34:55.025
Okay.

35:04.535 --> 35:07.538
And the father could,
you know,

35:07.538 --> 35:10.541
go blind sooner
and then...

35:10.541 --> 35:13.544
then he could smell the tar
on frankie's shoes,

35:13.544 --> 35:16.547
then he knows that
his son's the killer.

35:16.547 --> 35:19.050
Holy fuck,
that's fucking great!

35:19.050 --> 35:22.553
Then frankie's gotta put one
in his old man's head!

35:22.553 --> 35:26.057
Blam,
then another one,
blam!

35:26.557 --> 35:27.558
Fucking brilliant.

35:36.567 --> 35:38.569
I spent all day with
my best friend anna

35:39.070 --> 35:41.072
picking out her
bridesmaids' dresses.

35:41.072 --> 35:43.574
I still haven't
found anything for
anthony's confirmation.

35:43.574 --> 35:45.576
With all the flowers
coming into bloom,

35:45.576 --> 35:47.578
i would love
to be a june bride.

35:47.578 --> 35:52.083
Here's your
june groom.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.585
C'mon.

35:54.585 --> 35:56.587
Sorry i'm late.

35:56.587 --> 35:58.589
Babe, i ordered you some
pasta fajioli to start.

35:59.090 --> 36:01.092
And we're gonna get a plate
of antipast to share.

36:01.092 --> 36:04.595
They got some
rare imported salami.

36:04.595 --> 36:06.597
You feel okay,
christopher?

36:06.597 --> 36:08.599
I'm fine.

36:08.599 --> 36:11.102
We were just discussing
anna's wedding.

36:11.102 --> 36:13.104
What about
you guys?

36:13.104 --> 36:14.105
What about
who guys?

36:14.105 --> 36:15.606
You should make it
a double wedding.

36:16.107 --> 36:18.109
First someone
has to propose.

36:26.117 --> 36:28.119
Has anna chosen
her caterer yet?

36:28.119 --> 36:29.620
She booked
villa de roma.

36:29.620 --> 36:32.123
'Cause if you ask me,
caravaggio's is slipping.

36:32.123 --> 36:33.624
I heard they fired
their produce guy.

36:33.624 --> 36:35.126
Enough!

36:35.126 --> 36:36.127
I'm so sick and tired
of hearing you people

36:36.627 --> 36:37.628
talk about
food, food, food!

36:38.129 --> 36:39.630
That's all anybody
ever talks about

36:39.630 --> 36:42.133
is proscuitto, cheese,
and fucking fava beans.

36:42.133 --> 36:43.134
I'm drowning here.

36:43.634 --> 36:44.635
Take it easy!

36:44.635 --> 36:46.137
We're not even
engaged yet!

36:46.137 --> 36:47.638
When you're married

36:47.638 --> 36:49.140
you'll understand
the importance
of fresh produce.

36:49.640 --> 36:50.641
Fuck the importance!

36:50.641 --> 36:51.642
Oh!

37:04.155 --> 37:05.656
He didn't
mean that.

37:06.157 --> 37:07.158
Fuck him.

37:07.158 --> 37:08.659
I tried so hard
to be supportive

37:08.659 --> 37:14.165
with his art and
getting his screenplay made.

37:14.665 --> 37:20.171
His screenplay?

37:20.171 --> 37:22.173
Any updates
on wyczchuk?

37:22.673 --> 37:25.176
I'm working on it,
i got my ear to the dirt.

37:25.176 --> 37:26.677
We're wiring you
for the confirmation.

37:27.178 --> 37:28.179
You fucking prick.

37:28.179 --> 37:30.181
You think i'm wearing a wire
in god's house?

37:30.181 --> 37:31.182
Actually, yes.

37:31.182 --> 37:32.683
We don't care so much
about the service

37:32.683 --> 37:34.685
as the party right after
at tony's house.

37:34.685 --> 37:36.687
You miserable motherfuck,
i'm the kid's sponsor!

37:36.687 --> 37:39.190
Who the fuck i
s sponsoring you
, motherfucker?

37:50.701 --> 37:53.204
Excuse me, sir,
i don't want to
have to tell you again

37:53.204 --> 37:55.706
this is
a smoke- free
environment.

38:05.716 --> 38:07.218
Yo, amy.

38:07.218 --> 38:09.220
Hey, you.

38:09.220 --> 38:11.722
What a nice
surprise.

38:11.722 --> 38:13.224
I was in
the neighborhood.

38:13.224 --> 38:15.726
Where were you?

38:15.726 --> 38:18.229
I was at the big
chloe party.

38:18.729 --> 38:21.232
I sat across
from alphonse d'amato.

38:21.732 --> 38:27.238
God, these things
are killing me.

38:27.238 --> 38:29.740
I was thinking we could
stop down at umberto's.

38:29.740 --> 38:32.743
Excellent, i'll just
change real quick.

38:44.755 --> 38:46.757
I like those.

38:46.757 --> 38:51.762
Manolo blahnik.

38:51.762 --> 38:53.764
Let me see.

38:53.764 --> 38:55.766
What, these?

38:55.766 --> 38:57.268
Come here.

38:57.268 --> 38:59.270
You want
to see these?

38:59.770 --> 39:00.771
Yeah.

39:00.771 --> 39:04.775
You want to
see my shoes?

39:04.775 --> 39:07.278
You can look,
but you can't touch.

39:07.278 --> 39:08.779
I can't touch?

39:22.793 --> 39:24.795
So, what'd your
father do?

39:24.795 --> 39:27.798
Was he
a movie producer?

39:27.798 --> 39:30.801
He's a neurosurgeon
at cedars- sinai.

39:30.801 --> 39:32.803
What is this,
question and answer hour?

39:32.803 --> 39:34.805
I want to
know about you.

39:34.805 --> 39:36.807
I'm not usually
an open person.

39:36.807 --> 39:38.809
How come your old man
didn't pressure you

39:38.809 --> 39:40.811
to become
a doctor like him?

39:40.811 --> 39:43.814
I was premed at yale
my freshman year.

39:43.814 --> 39:44.815
Fuckin' yale,
i swear to god,

39:45.316 --> 39:47.318
you jews have your own
cosa nostra

39:47.318 --> 39:50.821
hidden in that
ivy fucking league.

39:50.821 --> 39:52.823
That's very funny.

39:52.823 --> 39:54.825
Very imagistic.

39:54.825 --> 39:56.327
Thank you.

39:56.327 --> 39:58.329
So...

39:58.329 --> 40:02.333
that blond guy in the club
the other night,

40:02.333 --> 40:03.834
what'd you
say to him?

40:03.834 --> 40:05.336
That's for me
to know.

40:05.336 --> 40:07.838
You make him an offer
he couldn't refuse?

40:07.838 --> 40:08.839
What'd you say?

40:09.340 --> 40:09.840
Nothing.

40:09.840 --> 40:11.342
C'mon!

40:11.342 --> 40:12.843
I told him,
"be a good boy

40:12.843 --> 40:18.849
and i'll let this girl
blow you afterwards."

40:18.849 --> 40:21.852
You ever been with a member
of the tribe before?

40:21.852 --> 40:22.853
Yeah.

40:22.853 --> 40:23.854
Really?

40:24.355 --> 40:25.356
What do you think,
i discriminate?

40:25.356 --> 40:26.857
I'm p. C.

40:26.857 --> 40:28.359
No, you haven't.

40:28.859 --> 40:31.362
So why you gotta ask
if you think you know it all?

40:31.362 --> 40:32.363
When?

40:32.363 --> 40:33.864
I don't
fucking tell.

40:33.864 --> 40:35.366
When?

40:35.366 --> 40:42.373
Two nights ago.

40:42.373 --> 40:46.877
You ever shag another
skinny- ginny?

40:47.378 --> 40:52.383
Oh, fuck, fuck me!
My cousin.

40:52.383 --> 40:54.385
How are we
gonna tell him?

40:54.385 --> 40:55.886
Amy, don't
do this now.

40:56.387 --> 40:58.889
We'll figure
something out, c'mon.

40:58.889 --> 41:00.391
I'm not
a terrible person.

41:00.891 --> 41:02.893
Amy, get
back here.

41:38.429 --> 41:39.930
Shit.

41:40.431 --> 41:41.432
Amy...

41:41.432 --> 41:42.933
amy, listen.

41:42.933 --> 41:45.436
"Long shot,
a nightclub.

41:45.436 --> 41:46.937
"Not just any nightclub.

41:46.937 --> 41:51.442
Cut to closeup on letter "c",
then an "o", then a "p"."

41:51.442 --> 41:53.444
You're not supposed
to be reading that.

41:53.944 --> 41:56.947
It's a limited distribution,
numbered draft.

41:56.947 --> 41:59.950
"Pull back to reveal
this is the copacabana.

41:59.950 --> 42:01.952
"Inside it's
all fun and games

42:01.952 --> 42:04.955
as mobsters wine and dine
their beautiful goomahs."

42:04.955 --> 42:07.958
Jesus,
you can see it.

42:07.958 --> 42:09.960
You can see the movie
from the words.

42:09.960 --> 42:12.463
This is the way
you write a fucking script.

42:17.968 --> 42:20.971
Fucking shit!

42:20.971 --> 42:22.473
Hey!

42:22.473 --> 42:24.975
Hey, come out
of there!

42:24.975 --> 42:26.977
He used it.

42:26.977 --> 42:29.480
What, just'cause he gave me
that tar- smell idea?

42:29.480 --> 42:30.981
I could've
come up with that.

42:30.981 --> 42:31.982
What?

42:32.483 --> 42:33.984
The friend of mine,
stone wiseguy,

42:33.984 --> 42:35.986
jon used his
whole fucking story.

42:35.986 --> 42:37.988
The she- male and acid,
it's all here.

42:37.988 --> 42:39.990
This is joey cippolina's
fucking story!

42:40.491 --> 42:41.992
There's no character
named cippolini.

42:42.493 --> 42:43.994
Forget it,
he can't put that in there!

42:44.495 --> 42:45.996
It's not
the same at all.

42:45.996 --> 42:47.498
What the fuck
you talking about?

42:47.498 --> 42:49.500
You said your wiseguy friend
was at a swing set.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.502
This guy gets
his dick sucked at
the statue of liberty.

42:51.502 --> 42:53.003
Don't you understand
where i come from?

42:53.504 --> 42:55.005
I explained it
how many times?

42:55.005 --> 42:57.007
Where are
you going?

42:57.508 --> 42:59.510
We can't
take it out now.

42:59.510 --> 43:02.012
We faxed it to oliver,
who's agreed to be attached.

43:02.012 --> 43:03.514
It's his
favorite thing.

43:03.514 --> 43:06.016
Don't, don't, don't,
he's sleeping.

43:06.517 --> 43:08.018
How mad could
your friend get?

43:08.018 --> 43:10.020
12- 04 checked out.

43:10.020 --> 43:12.022
Where is he?

43:12.022 --> 43:15.025
This is so absurd of you
to get so bent out of shape.

43:22.032 --> 43:24.034
Can i see your
production pass?

43:24.535 --> 43:25.536
I've been on
the set before.

43:25.536 --> 43:27.037
I still need
to see your pass.

43:27.037 --> 43:28.038
I know jon.

43:28.038 --> 43:29.540
Look, sir,
this is a closed set.

43:29.540 --> 43:33.043
No visitors, no press,
no friends of jon.

43:33.043 --> 43:34.044
Hey!

43:34.545 --> 43:35.546
Hey, buchiachia!

43:35.546 --> 43:36.547
Hi.

43:36.547 --> 43:37.548
Where's jon?

43:37.548 --> 43:39.049
He left this morning
for l. A.

43:39.049 --> 43:41.552
That fucking cocksucking
mezzofinook!

43:42.052 --> 43:43.053
What does
that mean?

43:43.053 --> 43:49.059
You got more stuff
like that i could use?

43:49.059 --> 43:51.562
The confirmation
starts in an hour.

43:51.562 --> 44:00.070
Would you let me in, already?
I need to put my face on.

44:00.070 --> 44:02.072
You've been in there
all week.

44:02.072 --> 44:04.575
I'm shaving!

44:04.575 --> 44:08.078
I don't want you
coming in here
while i'm in here!

44:08.078 --> 44:12.583
The only goddamn mirror with
any good light is in there!

44:12.583 --> 44:15.085
Here's your
fucking mirror.

44:15.085 --> 44:16.587
Jesus!

44:37.608 --> 44:41.111
Don't open
that fucking door!

44:41.111 --> 44:42.112
Shit.

44:49.620 --> 44:50.621
Fuck!

44:50.621 --> 44:52.122
You fucking bitch!

44:52.623 --> 44:55.125
I'll kill you,
i'll kill you!

44:55.125 --> 44:56.627
Dad!

44:56.627 --> 45:02.633
Jesus christ,
what the fuck's with you?

45:02.633 --> 45:04.134
What are you,
bleeding?

45:15.646 --> 45:19.149

45:21.151 --> 45:22.152
No, thank you.

45:22.152 --> 45:24.154
Wow, robert rodriguez
has signed on

45:24.154 --> 45:28.659

with harvey and bob.

45:28.659 --> 45:29.660
What is this shit?

45:30.160 --> 45:31.662
You don't return
my fucking messages?

45:31.662 --> 45:33.163
Christopher,
this is so not cool.

45:33.163 --> 45:34.665
You listen to me,
you stupid bitch!

45:35.165 --> 45:36.166
You cannot
use that story.

45:36.667 --> 45:37.668
Okay,
alright.

45:37.668 --> 45:39.169
This is neither the time
nor the place.

45:39.169 --> 45:41.171
You want to
see me clipped?

45:41.171 --> 45:43.173
Have you
touched base with jon?

45:43.674 --> 45:44.675
What the fuck?

45:44.675 --> 45:47.177
I call, i spoke to
his jerk- off assistants,

45:47.177 --> 45:49.179
she said i should
take it up with you.

45:49.179 --> 45:50.681
I'm sorry i don't even know
who that would be,

45:51.181 --> 45:52.182
that assistant.

45:52.182 --> 45:54.184
Sir, are you here to see
david decamillo?

45:54.685 --> 45:56.186
Get the fuck

45:56.186 --> 45:57.688
Look, i'm flying
into l. A. This afternoon,

45:57.688 --> 45:58.689
we'll touch base.

45:58.689 --> 46:01.692
You were
just gonna leave?

46:01.692 --> 46:04.194
What are you
talking about?

46:04.194 --> 46:06.196
My script.

46:06.196 --> 46:10.200
Christopher, based on
"mickey blue eyes"
first- weekend foreign,

46:10.200 --> 46:13.203
there's a wait- and- see attitude
toward mafi- related projects.

46:13.203 --> 46:15.205
So we're gonna
have to pass.

46:15.205 --> 46:16.707
Did jon say that?
Are those his words?

46:16.707 --> 46:18.709
I speak for jon,
and if you'd let me finish,

46:18.709 --> 46:20.711
we want to assure you
that we'll certainly

46:20.711 --> 46:22.212
take a look at
anything else you write.

46:22.212 --> 46:23.714
You're good.

46:23.714 --> 46:24.715
Christopher--

46:25.215 --> 46:26.717
fuckin' walnuts
don't lie as good as you.

46:27.217 --> 46:28.218
Amy.

46:28.218 --> 46:30.220
David's ready
to see you.

46:30.220 --> 46:31.221
Right this way.

46:31.722 --> 46:36.727
Chris, it was
wrong with us and...

46:36.727 --> 46:41.732
and greg
and all that.

46:41.732 --> 46:43.734
I really
liked you.

46:49.740 --> 46:52.743
This is getting kind of
"william inge" here,
isn't it?

46:52.743 --> 46:54.244
I gotta go.

46:54.745 --> 46:56.747
Fucking d- girl!

46:56.747 --> 46:58.749
Excuse me?

46:58.749 --> 47:01.251
Excuse me,

47:01.251 --> 47:03.754
You fucking

47:13.764 --> 47:15.766
Ton',

47:16.266 --> 47:17.267
Thanks, thanks.

47:17.267 --> 47:19.269
Kid did real good up

47:19.269 --> 47:20.771
Sabenedic'.

47:22.272 --> 47:23.774
Were you
proud of him?

47:23.774 --> 47:24.775
Oh, yeah.

47:24.775 --> 47:25.776
Where's carm?

47:25.776 --> 47:27.277
In the kitchen.

47:27.277 --> 47:28.278

47:28.278 --> 47:30.280
Some place you got

47:30.280 --> 47:32.282
Hey, richie,

47:40.791 --> 47:45.796
Oh, and we count
the silverware.

47:45.796 --> 47:47.798
Hi, i'm
janice soprano.

47:47.798 --> 47:49.299
Janice now?

47:49.800 --> 47:51.301
I don't know.

47:51.301 --> 47:54.304
I heard we won't be
bothered anymore
from our neighbor wyczchuk.

47:54.805 --> 47:56.306
No neighbor
of mine.

47:56.306 --> 47:58.308
What'd you
hear on that?

47:58.308 --> 48:00.310
Tony, we're out of
ice in here.

48:00.310 --> 48:01.812
Alright.

48:23.834 --> 48:25.335
Oh, shit.

48:25.335 --> 48:30.340
You two,
get out of here.

48:30.841 --> 48:32.843
Tony, we also
need more cokes--

48:32.843 --> 48:36.346
what is
that smell?

48:36.346 --> 48:37.848
What kind of animal

48:37.848 --> 48:39.850
smokes marijuana
at his own confirmation?

48:40.350 --> 48:41.852
I don't know.

48:41.852 --> 48:44.354
Enough with th
e "i don't knows".

48:44.354 --> 48:45.355
What are you
yelling at me for?

48:45.355 --> 48:47.357
Even grandma says
the world has no purpose.

48:47.357 --> 48:49.359
Get inside right now
and join your guests.

48:49.359 --> 48:51.862
Be a good catholic
for 15 fucking minutes!

48:51.862 --> 48:53.864
Is that
so much to ask?

49:10.380 --> 49:11.882
What happened,
what's the matter?

49:11.882 --> 49:13.383
You don't
want to know.

49:13.884 --> 49:16.386
Fucking kid's down in
the garage getting high.

49:16.386 --> 49:18.388
Alright,
let me talk to him.

49:28.899 --> 49:30.400
Anthony?

49:30.400 --> 49:31.902
Would you
go away?

49:32.402 --> 49:34.404
No, i'm
your sponsor.

49:34.404 --> 49:37.908
We need to talk,
you need to listen.

49:45.415 --> 49:47.417
You know,
you see your parents

49:47.918 --> 49:50.420
as these great big dictators,
these disciplinarians.

49:50.420 --> 49:52.923
But i know your dad
from the time
he was younger than you.

49:53.423 --> 49:55.926
What difference
does it make?

49:56.426 --> 49:59.429
Listen to me, alright?
You listening?

49:59.429 --> 50:00.931
Yeah.

50:00.931 --> 50:04.935
I know him.

50:04.935 --> 50:07.938
I was 16 years old,
and my kid sister nucci,

50:07.938 --> 50:10.440
she had
the spinal meningitis,

50:10.440 --> 50:17.447
and she got a to a point
where she couldn't breathe.

50:17.447 --> 50:18.448
She was
real sick?

50:18.448 --> 50:19.950
Yeah.

50:19.950 --> 50:21.952
And she was
in the hospital.

50:22.452 --> 50:23.954
And your father,
he was the only one,

50:24.454 --> 50:25.956
he came with me
every day.

50:26.456 --> 50:28.959
He sat by her bed,
he looked at her drawings.

50:28.959 --> 50:31.962
He watched her for me
when i had to use the john

50:31.962 --> 50:35.966
or get something
to eat.

50:35.966 --> 50:37.968
I was down there waiting
in line for a hamburger

50:38.468 --> 50:39.469
when she passed away.

50:39.970 --> 50:42.472
She died?

50:42.472 --> 50:45.475
Yeah.

50:45.475 --> 50:48.478
You know what pisses
me off about my dad?

50:48.478 --> 50:50.480
He did all these
great things, then,

50:50.981 --> 50:53.483
before
he was my dad.

50:53.984 --> 50:56.987
Now he's just
an asshole.

50:56.987 --> 51:00.490
Hey, hey, hey,
listen to me.

51:00.490 --> 51:02.993
Your father would
catch a bullet for you.

51:02.993 --> 51:04.995
Don't you ever
forget that.

51:04.995 --> 51:07.497
He's a stand- up guy.

51:07.497 --> 51:09.499
I don't know.

51:09.499 --> 51:11.001
Not to me
he's not.

51:11.501 --> 51:12.502
Well, i do know.

51:12.502 --> 51:14.504
And i know what kind
of man he is.

51:14.504 --> 51:21.511
Don't ever forget it.

51:21.511 --> 51:24.514
Uncle pussy,
what's the matter?

51:24.514 --> 51:26.516
Nothing.

51:36.026 --> 51:38.528
Now go down and enjoy
your party.

51:38.528 --> 51:40.030
Make your
parents happy.

51:40.030 --> 51:41.531
You got your health,
your family.

51:42.032 --> 51:43.533
Enjoy it
while you can,

51:43.533 --> 51:46.536
while you got it
all in your hand.

51:46.536 --> 51:47.537
Come here.

51:48.038 --> 51:49.539
Give uncle pussy
a hug.

51:49.539 --> 51:52.042
And get
out of here.

52:03.053 --> 52:04.554
Hey.

52:04.554 --> 52:10.560
Hey, he's
down there.

52:10.560 --> 52:12.062
Where the fuck
you been?

52:12.062 --> 52:14.064
This is
for a. J.

52:14.564 --> 52:17.567
I got one son and you miss
his confirmation ceremony?

52:17.567 --> 52:19.569
I figured
with all my sins

52:19.569 --> 52:24.074
i don't want the church
caving in on everyone.

52:24.074 --> 52:29.079
Hey!

52:29.079 --> 52:31.081
On the fucking
rag again.

52:31.081 --> 52:32.582
No, i'm
on the rag.

52:32.582 --> 52:34.084
She's just wondering
who the fuck you are.

52:34.084 --> 52:36.586
No lectures, alright?
I'm not in the mood.

52:36.586 --> 52:38.088
I agree.

52:38.088 --> 52:41.091
I'm gonna go back in there
and be with my guests.

52:41.091 --> 52:43.093
Exactly ten minutes,
i'm gonna look up,

52:43.093 --> 52:45.095
if you're not here
i'm gonna assume

52:45.095 --> 52:47.097
that you went to look for
whatever the fuck it is

52:47.597 --> 52:48.598
that's calling you
out there.

52:49.099 --> 52:50.600
And that i will
never see you again.

52:51.101 --> 52:55.105
If you are still here,
then i'm gonna assume

52:55.105 --> 52:58.108
that you have no other
desire in the world
than to be with me.

52:58.108 --> 53:01.111
And your actions will
show me that every second
of every fucking day.

53:01.111 --> 53:05.115
You understand me?

53:05.115 --> 53:06.116
Don't answer me.

53:06.116 --> 53:14.124
Take the ten minutes,
you think about it.

53:14.124 --> 53:16.126
Hey you,
come here.

53:16.126 --> 53:19.629
C'mon, let's take
the picture.

54:07.677 --> 54:10.180
C'mon, let's
get the picture.

54:10.180 --> 54:12.682
A. J. , c'mon.

54:12.682 --> 54:14.184
