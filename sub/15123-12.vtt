WEBVTT

00:07.308 --> 00:09.110
JIMMY:
Why are these dogs wearing
suits?

00:09.143 --> 00:11.212
They have job
interviews today, huh?

00:11.245 --> 00:13.781
(laughter)
No. They're auditioning
for a play I wrote.

00:13.814 --> 00:16.584
(laughter)

00:16.617 --> 00:18.786
Oh. You're not kidding.

00:18.819 --> 00:19.553
You wrote a play?

00:19.587 --> 00:20.488
Oh, that's awesome!

00:20.521 --> 00:21.722
Yeah, it's called
Hillary Clinton:

00:21.755 --> 00:23.291
The Woman
Who Should Have Been President.

00:23.324 --> 00:25.293
It explores the inner angst
of a woman who, in order

00:25.326 --> 00:27.395
to succeed in a man's world,
is forced to wear a pantsuit.

00:27.428 --> 00:29.430
Hmm. What's going on over there?

00:29.463 --> 00:30.198
Oh.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.865
Shelley's auditioning
Janet Renos.

00:31.899 --> 00:32.833
SHELLEY:
Oh, yeah. Well,

00:32.866 --> 00:33.801
the wig fits,

00:33.834 --> 00:35.869
but you're gonna have
to get your voice lower.

00:35.903 --> 00:36.837
It's still too feminine.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.840
Hey, you think
there's a part for Hope?
Yeah.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.143
She's either gonna play Hillary
Clinton or Monica Lewinsky.

00:42.176 --> 00:43.577
Oh, I hope she
gets Hillary.

00:43.611 --> 00:44.778
I don't know.

00:44.812 --> 00:47.148
Monica Lewinsky has a
really successful handbag line.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.949
Hillary's just a secretary.

00:48.982 --> 00:49.983
SHELLEY:
Butchie, no!

00:50.017 --> 00:51.385
No, stop it!

00:51.419 --> 00:53.020
Stop it!
I think we found
our Bill Clinton.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.523
(laughs)
Yeah.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.195
* Whoo!

01:01.229 --> 01:04.932
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh

01:04.965 --> 01:08.169
* Daddy-o, oh, oh, oh

01:08.202 --> 01:10.938
* Birth control, no, no, no

01:10.971 --> 01:14.041
* Let it roll, oh, oh, oh

01:14.074 --> 01:16.844
* Oh

01:16.877 --> 01:18.612
* Oh...

01:18.646 --> 01:20.314
* Whoo

01:20.348 --> 01:25.553
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

01:29.823 --> 01:32.693
(entrance bells tinkling)

01:32.726 --> 01:35.196
(buzzer sounds)

01:35.229 --> 01:37.298
Hey, Floyd, Big Judy.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.300
I lost ten pounds.

01:39.333 --> 01:41.469
Hey, Not-as-big-as-you-have-been
in-the-past Judy.

01:41.502 --> 01:44.172
You all here to pawn something
or buy something back?

01:44.205 --> 01:45.673
We came
to get back our cooler scooter.

01:45.706 --> 01:48.876
Yup. We thought we couldn't live
without a motorized scooter

01:48.909 --> 01:53.080
that kept 36 beers cold,
but no, no, we cannot.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.216
I'll get it, and Floyd,
while I'm gone,

01:55.249 --> 01:57.251
it wouldn't be the end
of the world

01:57.285 --> 01:58.619
if you would use
your math skills

01:58.652 --> 02:01.689
to figure out where the hell
I went wrong with that Sudoku.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.624
I hate coming in
here and seeing all

02:03.657 --> 02:05.659
my old stuff that
I had to sell.

02:05.693 --> 02:06.727
My light-up Frisbee,

02:06.760 --> 02:07.728
my Garbage Pail Kids,

02:07.761 --> 02:09.663
my Dr. Shazaamo Magic Kit.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.865
How has no one bought
this stuff?

02:11.899 --> 02:14.435
It's not easy for me, either.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.670
Every cool piece of jewelry
I've ever owned

02:16.704 --> 02:19.106
is right here
in this glass case.

02:19.139 --> 02:20.107
MAN:
Oh, yeah, baby...

02:20.140 --> 02:21.709
(indistinct chatter)

02:21.742 --> 02:26.113
MAN (on TV):
it's Mary Jane by a nose...

02:26.146 --> 02:27.548
Oh, hey, look at this.
Doesn't Mom have one

02:27.581 --> 02:29.183
of these little pig statues?

02:29.217 --> 02:30.784
Yeah, yeah,
your mom has all kinds of crap.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.786
Number one's a big mover...

02:32.820 --> 02:35.223
(indistinct voice on TV)

02:35.256 --> 02:38.492
So, you're watching dog
racing on our old TV.

02:38.526 --> 02:40.261
You looking to make bets?

02:40.294 --> 02:41.429
(soft groan)

02:41.462 --> 02:44.131
No. No, I'm done
with all that.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.599
Here it is.

02:45.633 --> 02:49.770
Give me 85 bucks,
and it's all yours again.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.539
You mean 25 bucks.
No.

02:51.572 --> 02:54.208
$25 by last Friday,
but you didn't pay by then.

02:54.242 --> 02:55.576
But this is all I have.

02:55.609 --> 02:58.812
MAN (on TV):
And they're off.

02:58.846 --> 03:01.915
Next to number four Naberdeze,
moving to the inside lane...

03:01.949 --> 03:03.317
How long
till the next race?

03:03.351 --> 03:06.053
Welcome back,
old friend.

03:06.086 --> 03:08.589
Welcome back.

03:08.622 --> 03:09.857
BURT:
Ah, Home on the Mange.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.359
Home on the Mange!

03:11.392 --> 03:13.727
Home on the Mange.
Come on, come on!

03:13.761 --> 03:14.928
Yes! Yes!

03:14.962 --> 03:16.864
Winner, winner, kibble dinner!

03:16.897 --> 03:18.632
(cheering on TV)

03:20.534 --> 03:22.803
VIRGINIA:
Gambling?

03:22.836 --> 03:24.204
Are you kidding me?

03:24.238 --> 03:25.606
You know
you have a gambling problem.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.775
I got our scooter cooler back.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.677
If anything,
you should be thanking me.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.778
Maybe
you have a thanking problem.

03:30.811 --> 03:32.112
Look at you.

03:32.145 --> 03:34.415
You're acting
like a maniac.

03:34.448 --> 03:36.617
All twitchy
with that crazy tongue of yours

03:36.650 --> 03:37.785
sticking out
of your head.

03:37.818 --> 03:38.719
I hate you like this!

03:38.752 --> 03:39.953
JIMMY:
Ah, what's the big deal

03:39.987 --> 03:41.355
with a little
bit of gambling?

03:41.389 --> 03:43.223
Dad went in there
with nothing,

03:43.257 --> 03:44.858
and made it
into something.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.394
(gasps)

03:46.427 --> 03:47.461
Stop it, Jimmy.

03:47.495 --> 03:49.630
The only thing worse
than pigeons is magic.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.765
Creeps me out.
I'm sorry.

03:51.799 --> 03:54.635
Will this make
you feel better?
Oh!

03:54.668 --> 03:55.403
Stop it!

03:55.436 --> 03:57.671
This is a serious situation.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.607
Mr. Ants-in-his-pants over here

03:59.640 --> 04:01.174
has a serious
history

04:01.208 --> 04:02.310
with gambling.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.877
(mutters)

04:03.911 --> 04:06.747
VIRGINIA:
He went on his last
gambling binge

04:06.780 --> 04:10.651
the year I had completed
my Porkchester collection.

04:10.684 --> 04:12.286
Your father was
on a hot streak,

04:12.320 --> 04:16.290
(Burt whooping, whirring)
...so he came in feeling
like a thousand bucks.

04:16.324 --> 04:18.459
Who's your daddy?!

04:18.492 --> 04:20.861
Oh, not you. I know you don't
know who your daddy is.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.463
Who's your daddy?

04:24.532 --> 04:26.133
VIRGINIA:
He bet on anything he could,

04:26.166 --> 04:28.469
and everything was great
until he started to lose.

04:28.502 --> 04:30.671
No, no, no!
How does a guy with one ball

04:30.704 --> 04:33.707
win a bicycle race
three years in a row?!

04:33.741 --> 04:35.943
Oh, less drag!

04:35.976 --> 04:38.412
Less drag.

04:38.446 --> 04:39.713
VIRGINIA:
Your dad lost so much,

04:39.747 --> 04:42.350
he had to pawn all
of his valuables.

04:44.318 --> 04:47.555
Then, when he lost even more,

04:47.588 --> 04:50.624
he had to pawn my valuables.

04:59.066 --> 05:01.635
And when he hit rock bottom,

05:01.669 --> 05:04.772
he pawned all
of your valuables.

05:11.579 --> 05:13.881
You told me you took
all the money out my piggy bank

05:13.914 --> 05:15.649
and put it
in a retirement four-oh-wunk.

05:15.683 --> 05:18.386
I'm telling you, Jimmy,
he has a serious problem.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.020
Virginia, it's under control.

05:20.053 --> 05:21.955
I can quit anytime I want.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.223
Mm-hmm.

05:23.256 --> 05:24.825
And maybe you won't be so mad

05:24.858 --> 05:27.561
when you see these beautiful
earrings I got for you.

05:27.595 --> 05:28.729
Oh.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.765
These are cufflinks
that say "Burt" on them.

05:31.799 --> 05:34.902
It's so hard to shop for you.

05:34.935 --> 05:35.803
Wait a second.
Mm.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.605
You said we pawned
all those toys

05:37.638 --> 05:39.272
to help starving
kids in Africa.

05:39.306 --> 05:40.408
You're telling me

05:40.441 --> 05:42.710
no one's starving in Africa?

05:47.815 --> 05:49.683
* Dick Nixon had Watergate

05:49.717 --> 05:51.419
* Hoover's depression
was really great *

05:51.452 --> 05:54.955
* W. Bush was clearly
not a genius, genius *

05:54.988 --> 05:58.592
* LBJ took us to 'Nam,
Barack's economy is a sham *

05:58.626 --> 06:02.663
* And the thing
they have in common is a... *

06:02.696 --> 06:04.432
"Penis."

06:04.465 --> 06:05.999
That's where you're supposed
to say, "penis."

06:06.033 --> 06:08.636
Look, if I pick you for Hillary,
you have to say "penis."

06:08.669 --> 06:09.970
Can she learn "penis"
by next Tuesday?

06:10.003 --> 06:12.906
Maybe, but how about you write
another lyric by next Tuesday?

06:12.940 --> 06:14.041
(sneezes)

06:14.074 --> 06:16.910
Allow me.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.712
Will you stop
with that nonsense?

06:18.746 --> 06:20.814
Unless you can come up
with a magic trick

06:20.848 --> 06:22.916
that'll make your dad's
gambling habit disappear.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.785
Oh, he said
he's not gambling anymore.

06:24.818 --> 06:26.454
Oh, please.

06:28.055 --> 06:31.425
Yes, yes, yes!

06:31.459 --> 06:34.828
Garfield finally got
himself some lasagna.

06:36.597 --> 06:38.666
Once he starts gambling,
he can't stop.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.400
Wait. He stopped
once before, right?

06:40.434 --> 06:42.035
So, how did you get him
to stop then?

06:42.069 --> 06:44.638
Well...

06:44.672 --> 06:47.107
VIRGINIA:
The only way Burt
would stop gambling

06:47.140 --> 06:49.376
was if he hit rock bottom.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.579
Okay, one more time.

06:51.612 --> 06:53.080
Who tied us up?

06:53.113 --> 06:54.482
The boogey man.

06:54.515 --> 06:56.984
No, not the boogey man.

06:57.017 --> 06:58.519
The book man.

06:58.552 --> 07:00.721
(car door closes)
You know what?

07:00.754 --> 07:02.923
Let's just do this.

07:02.956 --> 07:04.057
Here goes.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.058
(grunts)

07:05.092 --> 07:06.960
Ready?

07:06.994 --> 07:09.129
(Virginia yelling)

07:09.162 --> 07:10.931
What-what happened? What...?

07:10.964 --> 07:14.768
The bookies came and demanded
money, but we didn't have any,

07:14.802 --> 07:18.138
so they beat the hell out of us
and took your stilts.

07:18.171 --> 07:19.907
They got my stilts?

07:19.940 --> 07:22.375
Oh, man, I was just starting
to get good at those.

07:22.409 --> 07:23.544
I'm sorry, baby.

07:23.577 --> 07:25.012
I'll never gamble again.

07:25.045 --> 07:26.113
I'll make it up to you.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.148
(moaning)

07:28.181 --> 07:32.119
No, no, no, no, no, no!

07:32.152 --> 07:34.622
(screams)

07:35.523 --> 07:37.625
Why don't you guys
just do that again?

07:37.658 --> 07:39.392
Because Burt's on a
winning streak now.

07:39.426 --> 07:41.161
There's no bookie
to owe this time.

07:41.194 --> 07:42.162
You know, I
think there's

07:42.195 --> 07:42.996
a gamblers support group

07:43.030 --> 07:44.331
that meets
in my church basement.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.165
They've also got one

07:45.198 --> 07:47.300
for drinkers,
overeaters, sex addicts,

07:47.334 --> 07:48.168
druggies.

07:48.201 --> 07:49.202
The only thing they can't

07:49.236 --> 07:50.303
get people to go to is church.

07:50.337 --> 07:53.440
Ugh.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.809
Maw Maw's been
in my magic tricks again.

08:03.450 --> 08:06.186
Hi. I'm Patty.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.789
Welcome to Gamblers Incognito.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.992
We're not affiliated
with that other organization.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.226
They have 12 steps.

08:13.260 --> 08:15.629
We only have one-- don't bet!

08:15.663 --> 08:20.167
Like, I said,
I am Patty, and I gamble.

08:20.200 --> 08:21.602
ALL:
Hi, Patty.

08:21.635 --> 08:22.870
Hi, guys.

08:22.903 --> 08:25.839
I live in Camden County,
but I come to meetings here

08:25.873 --> 08:27.307
because I work in the,
um, service industry...

08:27.340 --> 08:28.542
Oh, my. Oh!

08:28.576 --> 08:30.510
...and I prefer my clients not
know I have questionable morals.

08:30.544 --> 08:32.880
What are the odds
of seeing you two here?

08:32.913 --> 08:35.749
Uh, we try not to phrase things
that way in the meetings.

08:35.783 --> 08:37.785
PATTY: She has not gambled
for four years.
Oh, got it.

08:37.818 --> 08:39.553
Three years ago,
Barney bet me

08:39.587 --> 08:41.589
I couldn't fit ten
marshmallows in my mouth.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.991
Two weeks later, we
were selling our blood

08:44.024 --> 08:47.027
for some action
on women's bowling.

08:47.060 --> 08:50.230
Gambling is a
harsh mistress.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.431
I knew you were a gambler.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.600
I could tell

08:52.633 --> 08:54.167
by the quality of meat you buy.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.003
(quiet chuckle)

08:57.805 --> 09:00.874
Chicago won, which means
I'm taking back my pogo stick.

09:00.908 --> 09:03.243
And put me down
for 40 on Penn State.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.212
Nope. You're cut off.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.213
You're too hot.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.048
I'm losing too much money.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.884
Now take your pogo stick
and bounce out of here.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.854
Uh, at least let me win enough
to buy the other pogo stick.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.989
I'll look like an idiot
pogo-sticking alone.

09:16.023 --> 09:17.825
(quietly):
Maybe this can help you.

09:17.858 --> 09:20.027
What am I supposed to do
with your grocery receipt?

09:20.060 --> 09:22.830
And what are you doing buying
$200 worth of junk food?

09:22.863 --> 09:24.264
Your wife's
gonna get diabetes, man.

09:24.297 --> 09:25.799
She'll lose her foot, Floyd.

09:25.833 --> 09:28.235
You'll be painting nails
on the nub of a stub with this.

09:28.268 --> 09:29.837
No. Turn it over.

09:29.870 --> 09:31.471
There's an address
on the back.

09:31.504 --> 09:32.505
A place where you can gamble.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.541
Oh. Thanks, buddy.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.777
Good luck with the foot.

09:39.546 --> 09:42.082
Floyd, door!

09:46.186 --> 09:49.122
Hey, you're the guy
that takes bets?

09:49.156 --> 09:51.124
Come on. You a cop?

09:51.158 --> 09:52.125
Let me see your eyes.

09:52.159 --> 09:53.727
How do I know
you're not a cop?

09:53.761 --> 09:55.162
Let me see your eyes.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.264
Okay, count of three.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.800
One, two, three.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.736
How does this prove
neither of us are cops?

10:02.770 --> 10:05.172
I don't know.
It never went this far before.

10:05.205 --> 10:06.173
I guess you're okay.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.575
You're just in time
for the first race.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.843
(whistle blows)

10:11.578 --> 10:13.681
Dig, Robbie, dig!

10:14.181 --> 10:16.483
Yes! Yes! Oh!

10:16.516 --> 10:18.786
Yes! 20-to-one.

10:18.819 --> 10:21.154
Nothing more beautiful
than a fast fat kid!

10:21.188 --> 10:22.322
(clapping)

10:22.355 --> 10:23.691
Ah, Burt's not going to quit

10:23.724 --> 10:25.292
while he's winning.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.660
Nobody does.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.061
No man's going to quit gambling

10:28.095 --> 10:29.697
unless he hits a cold streak.

10:29.730 --> 10:33.033
Or-- and I don't want
to be out of bounds here--

10:33.066 --> 10:35.135
you could hope
he finds a substitute vice.

10:35.168 --> 10:39.306
Which I'd be happy to provide
at a special introductory rate.

10:39.339 --> 10:40.741
I'm a hooker.

10:40.774 --> 10:43.811
Yeah, that's a little
out of bounds.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.612
Just putting it out there.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.881
Some folks have an arrangement.

10:47.915 --> 10:50.183
The good news is,
Burt will start losing.

10:50.217 --> 10:51.651
Or he'll keep winning

10:51.685 --> 10:53.186
and get so rich,
he'll buy a hot,

10:53.220 --> 10:56.690
half-robotic wife who
doesn't yap, yap, yap
about his gambling.

10:56.724 --> 10:59.827
Either way, you won't
have a problem for long.

10:59.860 --> 11:03.096
Don't worry, we all hit cold
streaks sooner or later.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.966
Look, I wrote down who
I would have bet on yesterday

11:05.999 --> 11:08.001
just to remind myself
how unlucky I am.

11:08.035 --> 11:10.070
Check it out.
0-for-12.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.539
Every idiot gambler thinks
they have a system.

11:12.572 --> 11:16.009
I think the only real system
would be to wait for us

11:16.043 --> 11:18.245
to make a pick,
then choose the opposite.

11:18.278 --> 11:19.246
You'd make a fortune.

11:19.279 --> 11:22.950
A fortune? Really?

11:22.983 --> 11:24.985
BARNEY:
Perfect system.
For instance,

11:25.018 --> 11:25.753
I like Texas tonight.

11:25.786 --> 11:27.087
PATTY:
Me, too.

11:27.120 --> 11:31.058
You bet Oklahoma,
you got yourself free money.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.295
MAN (on radio):
It's a diving catch.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.297
Touchdown!
(laughs)

11:37.330 --> 11:38.565
And Oklahoma wins.

11:38.598 --> 11:41.168
Yes!

11:41.201 --> 11:42.635
Nice pick.

11:42.669 --> 11:43.937
I don't want any money.

11:43.971 --> 11:47.074
I'll take my winnings
in the form of a Porkchester.

11:49.843 --> 11:52.379
You're coming home, buddy.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.681
Don't worry.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.216
I'm coming back
for all of you.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.920
Mama's got a system.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.459
Hey.

12:06.493 --> 12:09.362
Good thing you didn't bet
on that Texas game, huh?

12:09.396 --> 12:10.463
They got killed.

12:10.497 --> 12:11.464
That's right,

12:11.498 --> 12:13.466
and since I didn't make a bet
I would have lost,

12:13.500 --> 12:15.502
I rewarded myself with a new
pair of skinny jeans.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.570
Oh, you really turned
a negative into a positive.

12:17.604 --> 12:20.307
You ever thought about sharing
that with the rest of the group?

12:20.340 --> 12:21.608
Maybe start by asking

12:21.641 --> 12:22.876
who everyone likes in the game

12:22.910 --> 12:24.111
tonight between, uh...

12:24.144 --> 12:26.513
Notre Dame or Ohio Street?

12:26.546 --> 12:28.081
Huh?

12:32.752 --> 12:35.488
Daniel France, AV Club.

12:35.522 --> 12:38.325
You got to have strong legs
to push that TV on a cart,

12:38.358 --> 12:40.994
and you got to be quick
to run from those bullies.

12:41.028 --> 12:42.462
You, sir, are a winner.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.432
(gasps)

12:45.465 --> 12:46.699
You're home early.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.735
I wasn't expecting you
to be home.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.171
I-I was just leaving.

12:51.204 --> 12:52.305
Okay, then.

13:01.481 --> 13:05.318
JIMMY:
You'll never guess
who's playing Hillary Clinton.

13:05.352 --> 13:08.521
VIRGINIA:
I'm guessing it's the
baby in the pantsuit.

13:08.555 --> 13:09.756
Yeah, she's the strongest actor.

13:09.789 --> 13:10.958
She's a lot better
at keeping her fingers

13:10.991 --> 13:12.125
out of her nose, and she doesn't

13:12.159 --> 13:13.526
change her expression
when she poops.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.195
I heard the same thing
about Renee Zellweger.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.763
Oh, I'm sure that's
funny, but I have no idea

13:16.796 --> 13:17.764
who that is.

13:17.797 --> 13:19.199
Who deserves a Popsicle?

13:19.232 --> 13:20.667
No!
Aah!

13:20.700 --> 13:22.569
What are you doing? Aah!

13:22.602 --> 13:24.437
(gasps)

13:24.471 --> 13:25.472
Patty.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.441
You were hiding a tiny pig
in your freezer.

13:29.509 --> 13:33.613
You're hiding 20 tiny pigs
in your freezer.

13:33.646 --> 13:37.584
I just didn't want Burt to know
I'd wagered on some games.

13:37.617 --> 13:38.185
Oh, no.

13:38.218 --> 13:39.219
Now you're gambling, too?

13:39.252 --> 13:40.820
What your father does
is gambling.

13:40.854 --> 13:42.755
This is completely different.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.024
Listen to this.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.458
MAN:
That's it.

13:45.492 --> 13:50.263
Tennessee has won in a blowout
that nobody, nobody saw coming!

13:50.297 --> 13:51.631
I saw it coming.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.400
I see them all coming.

13:53.433 --> 13:54.034
Whoa!

13:54.067 --> 13:55.368
So you know who wins games?

13:55.402 --> 13:57.237
Yes. I talk to losers.

13:57.270 --> 14:00.207
So, if eight of them would bet
one way, I just bet the other.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.309
And the Bruins upset
the USC Trojans!

14:02.342 --> 14:04.611
Who would have seen that
coming?!

14:04.644 --> 14:05.678
Me! Ha!

14:05.712 --> 14:07.014
Whoa.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.481
It's a math-mematical system.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.550
I got to get in on this;
I'm not sure it's a good idea,

14:10.583 --> 14:12.185
but I keep hearing the sound
of a cash register

14:12.219 --> 14:14.154
"ka-chinging" in my head,
so I feel like I have to.

14:14.187 --> 14:15.555
I've got money on a few games
at seven,

14:15.588 --> 14:17.324
but you're never going to
make it down there in time.

14:17.357 --> 14:18.992
But we have to;
I've got $80 in my pocket.

14:19.026 --> 14:20.894
If I don't bet a sure thing,
I'm down $80!

14:20.928 --> 14:22.595
I can't afford to lose
that kind of scratch.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.565
You're right.
I've got $20 in my purse.
Why aren't I betting it?

14:25.598 --> 14:27.634
What are you doing?
You're costing us money!

14:27.667 --> 14:30.303
There's something called
a parlay that pays six-to-one.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.139
$20 at six-to-one?!
Do you know what that would pay?

14:32.172 --> 14:34.207
No.
Well, we'll never know
if we don't get down there!

14:34.241 --> 14:35.909
Damn it, I can't find my keys
in my stupid purse!

14:35.943 --> 14:36.876
I'll drive!

14:36.910 --> 14:37.777
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

14:37.810 --> 14:38.811
(grunts)

14:38.845 --> 14:40.180
No worries.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.582
I'll just stay here
with your daughter.

14:43.316 --> 14:45.318
You may have a gambling gene

14:45.352 --> 14:47.787
you may need to look out for.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.756
Your family is cut off.

14:49.789 --> 14:50.857
What?

14:50.890 --> 14:52.392
Y'all are winning too much.

14:52.425 --> 14:54.661
I didn't get into the bookie
business to lose money.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.264
That's not fair;
we want to place a bet.
Yeah, well,

14:57.297 --> 14:59.499
I want to eat chocolate cake
without losing my eyesight,

14:59.532 --> 15:01.701
but that's not going
to happen either.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.403
Now, if you'll excuse me,

15:03.436 --> 15:06.506
I'm going to go get
some chocolate cake.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.680
Why do I need a prescription
for insulin?

15:13.713 --> 15:14.714
Turn it over.

15:14.747 --> 15:15.915
Address on back.

15:15.949 --> 15:17.750
A guy there will take your bets.

15:17.784 --> 15:19.152
Ah.

15:19.186 --> 15:21.154
ALL:
...three, four...

15:21.188 --> 15:22.855
COACH:
All right.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.491
What are you guys
doing here?

15:24.524 --> 15:26.193
What are you doing here?
I'm not gambling.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.327
I just like to look
at children.

15:27.360 --> 15:28.495
There's no law against that.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.297
Save it, Burt.
We're all gambling.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.464
Now let's make some money.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.500
Finally, something
we can do as a family.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.634
Where's our competition?

15:34.667 --> 15:35.835
Gone. I cleaned them all out.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.270
I'm up $200 and three nickels

15:37.304 --> 15:38.972
and a juice box I found
under the bleachers.

15:39.006 --> 15:40.507
Well, we can't just bet
against each other.

15:40.540 --> 15:41.308
No, no, just our luck.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.475
We finally turn
into winners

15:42.509 --> 15:43.943
and we can't find
any losers around.

15:43.977 --> 15:46.413
We know where
to find some losers.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.487
Hey, you guys want to gamble?

16:12.372 --> 16:15.408
* Darkest of night
with the moon shining bright *

16:15.442 --> 16:17.944
* There's a set goin' strong

16:17.977 --> 16:19.679
* Lot of thing's goin' on

16:19.712 --> 16:23.583
* The man of the hour
has an air of great power *

16:23.616 --> 16:25.818
* The dudes have envied him
for so long *

16:25.852 --> 16:27.254
(blows whistle)

16:27.287 --> 16:28.988
* Oh, superfly...

16:29.022 --> 16:30.657
JIMMY:
We were back on the ride.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.360
* You're gonna make your fortune
by and by *

16:33.393 --> 16:34.927
* But if you lose

16:34.961 --> 16:36.663
* Don't ask no questions why

16:36.696 --> 16:38.198
(whooping)

16:38.231 --> 16:39.232
Great job, Maria!

16:39.266 --> 16:40.700
JIMMY:
I could kiss you!

16:40.733 --> 16:41.834
* Ooh, superfly

16:41.868 --> 16:42.835
But I won't.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.271
Never would.

16:44.304 --> 16:45.805
JIMMY:
And it was beautiful.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.507
* But if you lose

16:47.540 --> 16:49.876
* Don't ask no questions why

16:49.909 --> 16:50.777
(blows whistle)

16:50.810 --> 16:52.845
* The only game you know
is do or die *

16:52.879 --> 16:54.681
VIRGINIA:
Go, Jeffrey, go, Jeffrey,
go, Jeffrey, go, go!

16:54.714 --> 16:55.682
Move!

16:55.715 --> 16:56.949
Yes, Jeffrey!

16:56.983 --> 16:58.885
You kicked their asses.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.987
I didn't mean to say "asses."

17:01.020 --> 17:03.356
"Asses" is a no-no word.

17:03.390 --> 17:05.758
JIMMY:
'Cause once again,
we couldn't lose.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.427
Hey, kid.

17:07.460 --> 17:10.230
You run like you've got
a dump in your pants.

17:10.263 --> 17:12.732
You should all
call him Dumpy Pants.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.535
(mocking laughter)

17:15.568 --> 17:18.771
JIMMY:
And even when all the scheduled
classes were done,

17:18.805 --> 17:20.740
Dad convinced the gym coach
to race all the kids

17:20.773 --> 17:24.877
who had showed up with
"get out of gym class" notes.

17:24.911 --> 17:26.079
(whistle blows)

17:26.113 --> 17:27.814
* Taking all
that he can take... *

17:27.847 --> 17:29.749
(blows whistle)

17:29.782 --> 17:30.750
Yes!

17:30.783 --> 17:33.420
* Gambling with the odds
of fate... *

17:33.453 --> 17:34.854
(wheezing)

17:34.887 --> 17:36.156
(inhaling)

17:36.189 --> 17:37.424
Yes! Two.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.326
* Tryin' to get over

17:39.359 --> 17:40.927
* Tryin' to get over...

17:40.960 --> 17:42.662
Yes!

17:42.695 --> 17:44.431
Three.

17:44.464 --> 17:47.667
* Tryin' to get over

17:48.468 --> 17:50.870
* Ooh, superfly...

17:50.903 --> 17:52.839
Yes! Yes!

17:52.872 --> 17:54.040
None of the above!

17:54.073 --> 17:57.076
None of
the above!

17:57.110 --> 18:01.281
All in all, we made a fortune.

18:01.314 --> 18:02.482
(sniffing)
Ah!

18:02.515 --> 18:04.284
Not only am I going to be able

18:04.317 --> 18:05.885
to finish
my Porkchesters collection,

18:05.918 --> 18:09.389
but I'm going to be able to
start my dead al-Qaeda leaders

18:09.422 --> 18:10.623
commemorative plate collection!

18:10.657 --> 18:12.125
Gamblers Incognito
is the greatest thing

18:12.159 --> 18:13.893
that ever happened
to this family.
Oh!

18:13.926 --> 18:14.994
(cell phone ringing)

18:15.027 --> 18:16.062
Hello?

18:16.095 --> 18:17.330
SABRINA:
Where are you?

18:17.364 --> 18:19.065
You're missing Hope's play.
Oh, my God.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.000
We're missing Hope's play!

18:21.033 --> 18:22.034
Whoops.

18:22.068 --> 18:23.703
BURT:
Sweet Adeline,

18:23.736 --> 18:25.372
we're missing Hope's play!

18:25.405 --> 18:26.973
Hey, where you guys going?

18:27.006 --> 18:28.641
It's time for the harness races.

18:41.288 --> 18:42.555
There you are.

18:42.589 --> 18:44.157
You missed a great performance.

18:44.191 --> 18:46.493
Well, except
for Vice President Biden.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.395
He scooted
across the Oval Office

18:48.428 --> 18:50.763
and kind of left his own
Presidential Seal.

18:50.797 --> 18:51.764
We missed it?

18:51.798 --> 18:52.632
Yeah.

18:52.665 --> 18:54.201
Where were you guys?
Gambling?

18:54.234 --> 18:56.669
Damn, I did it again!

18:56.703 --> 18:59.672
BURT:
And this time I dragged
my whole family into it.

18:59.706 --> 19:00.707
Damn!

19:00.740 --> 19:02.742
I hate theater, politics
and women's lib,

19:02.775 --> 19:06.413
but I still wanted to
see Hope dance around
in that little pantsuit.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.481
JIMMY:
In that moment, we all learned

19:08.515 --> 19:10.650
that when you get obsessed
with gambling,

19:10.683 --> 19:14.120
you can lose things that are
much more valuable than money.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.622
Things you can't get back.

19:15.655 --> 19:18.591
Maybe you guys could do
an encore performance.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.662
Uh, I can't make any promises.

19:22.695 --> 19:26.399
I think Bill Clinton's
getting neutered tomorrow.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.735
JIMMY:
We knew we had a problem,
so the next day,

19:28.768 --> 19:30.670
we all went
to Gamblers Incognito,

19:30.703 --> 19:32.138
which is a little less
incognito

19:32.171 --> 19:34.207
when you go
with your whole family.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.509
And that's when I looked
at this little lady

19:36.543 --> 19:41.548
and said to myself,
"Who's the real pig here?"

19:42.749 --> 19:44.884
JIMMY:
And after we begged her to,

19:44.917 --> 19:46.286
Shelley made a lot of calls

19:46.319 --> 19:48.521
and got the cast
to redo the show for us.

19:50.723 --> 19:53.260
(piano intro plays)

19:56.629 --> 19:58.331
ENTIRE CAST:
* Hillary

19:58.365 --> 20:01.401
* I'm talkin' about Hillary

20:01.434 --> 20:05.305
* Never run of the mill-ary

20:05.338 --> 20:08.575
* She taught us to stand

20:09.642 --> 20:13.280
* Fixed the economy,
so we're all rich *

20:13.313 --> 20:15.682
* You made Kim Jong-il
your bitch *

20:15.715 --> 20:19.686
* You took Afghanistan and made
it more like Disneyland *

20:19.719 --> 20:28.795
ENTIRE CAST:
* It's Hillary Rodham Clinton

20:28.828 --> 20:30.863
* "Bill" who?!

20:30.897 --> 20:31.898
(applause)

20:31.931 --> 20:33.333
(whooping)

20:33.366 --> 20:34.567
(whooping)

20:37.337 --> 20:41.341
Are you related to the
girl that played Hillary?

20:41.374 --> 20:42.842
That was my granddaughter.

20:42.875 --> 20:44.811
Which one's yours?

20:44.844 --> 20:46.779
My Butchie played Bill Clinton.
Oh!

20:46.813 --> 20:48.381
I haven't been this
proud of him

20:48.415 --> 20:50.249
since he stopped barking
at minorities.

20:50.283 --> 20:52.819
Well, he's quite the hound.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.254
How did this compare
with yesterday's show?

20:55.288 --> 20:56.789
There was no show yesterday.

20:56.823 --> 20:58.658
Ooh, Butchie!

20:58.691 --> 21:01.594
Yes, you're mama's special guy.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.229
Hey.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.397
We didn't miss that play.

21:04.431 --> 21:06.866
You lied to us
so we would stop gambling.

21:06.899 --> 21:07.967
You tricked us!

21:08.000 --> 21:09.736
Just like you tricked Burt.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.379
Thank you.

21:20.347 --> 21:21.814
You know, I was wondering
how you got people

21:21.848 --> 21:23.883
to sit through that awful play
twice.

21:23.916 --> 21:26.185
WOMAN:
Butchie, no!

21:26.218 --> 21:28.821
This is private behavior.

21:28.855 --> 21:32.825
That dog playing Bill Clinton
doesn't know the show's over.

21:32.859 --> 21:35.395
Oh, that's going
to leave a stain.

21:36.028 --> 21:37.530
CHILD:
Oh, well.
