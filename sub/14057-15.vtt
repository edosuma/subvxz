WEBVTT

00:01.067 --> 00:02.329
-I'm pregnant.
-What?

00:02.502 --> 00:04.834
-Previously on The O.C.:
-We're having a baby.

00:05.005 --> 00:07.564
-Find something you care about.
-I could be a critic.

00:07.741 --> 00:10.107
Spending your whole life
watching terrible movies?

00:10.276 --> 00:13.040
-Wanna rent An Inconvenient Truth?
-What'd you tell Frank?

00:13.213 --> 00:16.705
I told him that right now, I need to be
spending some time with my daughter.

00:16.883 --> 00:21.081
So let's put it all on the table.
I love you, and I don't wanna lose you.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.383
-Mom!
-It's okay, it's just-- Just an earthquake!

00:27.560 --> 00:28.925
Get in.

00:29.496 --> 00:31.327
Kirsten!

00:58.892 --> 01:02.157
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Ryan.
-It's okay, it's okay. It's all right.

01:02.328 --> 01:03.693
All right.

01:03.863 --> 01:07.128
Okay, I'm gonna count to three,
and you're gonna get out of here, okay?

01:07.300 --> 01:10.394
-No, you're gonna hurt yourself.
-Don't have a choice. One...

01:10.570 --> 01:15.064
-Okay, okay.
-...two, three. Now go, go, go.

01:17.677 --> 01:19.577
Ryan?

01:19.846 --> 01:22.041
Ryan, are you okay?

01:22.749 --> 01:25.240
Yeah, yeah.

01:26.286 --> 01:28.652
-You?
-Yeah.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.449
I'm fine, thanks to you.

01:34.394 --> 01:35.622
Hey, Ryan.

01:35.795 --> 01:39.287
Sorry I was all, "Oh, my God,"
because usually, I'm very good in a crisis.

01:39.466 --> 01:42.060
But I started thinking about
if anything happened to you.

01:42.235 --> 01:44.863
-I don't know what I'd do.
-It's okay. We're both okay.

01:45.038 --> 01:48.496
Grace under fire is important.
I don't want you to think I'm lacking in it.

01:48.675 --> 01:52.304
We might encounter all sorts of crises
when we're away together at college or--

01:52.479 --> 01:55.107
Oh, my God. Is that blood?
I faint at the sight of blood.

01:55.281 --> 01:58.580
-Oh, no, no, no. It's just glitter. Okay.
-Taylor. Taylor.

01:59.052 --> 02:02.044
All that stuff we put
on the table just now?

02:02.522 --> 02:03.989
Let's talk about it later, okay?

02:04.157 --> 02:06.125
Right, yeah.
That's probably a good idea.

02:06.292 --> 02:09.283
When the power's back on
and we're not sitting in rubble.

02:09.461 --> 02:13.159
I'm gonna call Kirsten and Sandy.
Where's my jacket?

02:13.433 --> 02:16.266
Gross. Sorry.

02:17.904 --> 02:20.805
You know, I've actually stockpiled
some rudimentary supplies...

02:20.974 --> 02:24.000
...in case of, you know,
the apocalypse or whatever.

02:24.177 --> 02:28.739
Got all sorts of stuff in there.
Got extra tennis shoes and flashlights...

02:28.915 --> 02:30.906
...and canned goods.

02:31.084 --> 02:33.348
A space heater.

02:34.888 --> 02:38.722
-And an extra pair of....
-I'm not--

02:39.192 --> 02:42.787
Hey, couldn't get reception in here.
I'm gonna step out in the hall.

02:42.962 --> 02:44.987
Okay. Okay.

02:55.942 --> 02:59.469
Yes, Orange County, as you've probably
figured out, that was an earthquake.

02:59.646 --> 03:01.238
So far, no reports of fatalities.

03:01.414 --> 03:03.439
But power is out, cell lines are jammed...

03:03.616 --> 03:06.016
...and the roads
are for emergency vehicles only.

03:06.186 --> 03:08.586
As more information comes in,
we 'll relay it to you.

03:08.755 --> 03:12.350
So if you're safe, stay calm and stay put.

03:12.525 --> 03:15.153
So we got our marching orders,
or our staying-put orders.

03:16.429 --> 03:18.954
So no one' s to leave the plaza
unless they have to.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.827
What are we gonna do with everyone?

03:21.367 --> 03:24.336
People are scared. They'll get hungry.

03:24.504 --> 03:27.098
-What about looters?
-We just have to get organized.

03:27.640 --> 03:30.768
So keep the radio on, gather up
anything you think might be useful.

03:30.944 --> 03:33.708
Flashlights, blankets, water, batteries.
You'll be fine.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.643
Yeah.

03:40.119 --> 03:43.020
-I can't reach either of the boys.
-Keep trying. How about you?

03:43.189 --> 03:47.285
-We should get you to the hospital.
-I'm fine. It's just a bump on the head.

03:47.460 --> 03:50.623
Mine. Not his or hers.

03:50.930 --> 03:54.195
Hello? Ryan, where are you?

03:54.667 --> 03:57.693
-They're at the Cooper house with Taylor.
-Tell him to stay there.

03:57.870 --> 03:58.928
Just stay there, okay?

04:02.709 --> 04:04.973
-Seth.
-Hey, Dad.

04:05.144 --> 04:09.012
Yeah, yeah. We're okay. I wish I could
say the same for Ryan's car, though.

04:09.182 --> 04:12.117
How's Mom? And Ryan?

04:12.652 --> 04:14.779
Ryan and Taylor are at your house.

04:14.954 --> 04:18.981
Yeah, it sounds good. We'll do that.
All right, take care.

04:19.759 --> 04:22.227
-Found a flashlight.
-I can see. Good. We can use it.

04:22.395 --> 04:25.523
We'll have to get back. My dad thinks
we should get off the streets.

04:25.698 --> 04:28.258
Why? He hear something?
About aftershocks or looters--?

04:28.434 --> 04:32.564
Zombies? That was my first thought too.
But, no, it's just a precaution.

04:39.679 --> 04:42.079
-It's Ryan.
-ls everyone okay?

04:42.248 --> 04:45.149
Yeah, we just have to make
a little change of plans.

05:42.008 --> 05:44.943
-Your dad said to go home.
-I think we should all be together.

05:46.746 --> 05:49.408
-This is a bad idea.
-We're almost there.

05:49.582 --> 05:51.447
-No, we're not.
-Just a few more minutes.

05:51.617 --> 05:56.020
Well, I know where my own house is, okay?
Look, I command you to stop this bike.

05:57.557 --> 05:59.684
I'm sorry, but I'm starting
to get creeped out.

05:59.859 --> 06:02.521
Not that I don't wanna play Pictionary
by candlelight...

06:02.695 --> 06:06.859
...and raid Taylor's apocalypse kit.
I think we should just go to your house.

06:07.467 --> 06:10.459
Okay, but I'm still awaiting news
on Pancakes.

06:10.636 --> 06:12.194
Pancakes?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.704
Ryan said everyone was fine.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.604
I know, but I don't know
that he included rodents.

06:17.810 --> 06:19.175
So I texted him to be sure.

06:19.345 --> 06:21.973
-And?
-And I am still waiting on the reply.

06:25.251 --> 06:27.515
Maybe I should pedal.
You look a little tired.

06:27.687 --> 06:30.554
-No.
-Fine.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.414
Go.

06:49.909 --> 06:54.972
Frank. Hi, it's Julie. I hope you're okay.
Kaitlin and I are fine.

06:55.148 --> 06:58.140
We're trapped at the ice cream store
on the pier, but we're fine.

06:58.317 --> 07:00.751
I guess help is probably on the way.

07:00.920 --> 07:05.016
Okay, well, take care. Bye.

07:05.725 --> 07:08.523
I understand why you keep on
calling Summer and the Cohens...

07:08.694 --> 07:10.025
...but why Frank?

07:10.196 --> 07:12.630
Weren't you guys
supposed to take it down a notch?

07:12.799 --> 07:16.530
We're pulling things back a bit. We haven't
stopped caring about each other.

07:16.702 --> 07:19.671
Wherever Frank is, he's worried about us,
like I am about him.

07:19.839 --> 07:23.935
And I am about myself,
because we're stuck here with him.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.977
The back door's stuck too.
Looks like there's no way out.

07:27.413 --> 07:29.244
-We're trapped.
-Figures.

07:29.415 --> 07:31.576
We can't just sit here,
waiting to be rescued.

07:31.751 --> 07:34.879
Totally. You know, we should start
eating all the melting ice cream.

07:35.054 --> 07:37.784
-I want a Gold Medal Ribbon on--
-Sugar cone? I know.

07:39.559 --> 07:43.222
Creepy but convenient.
Okay, ice-cream guy, start scooping.

07:43.396 --> 07:44.795
It's Gary, my name.

07:46.599 --> 07:47.964
Okay.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.796
I'm thinking the roof,
or where the roof used to be.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.302
Ice-cream guy, you got a ladder?

07:53.473 --> 07:56.931
-You can't climb up there.
-I'm not going to, you are.

07:58.711 --> 08:01.908
And this is my personal-safety device.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.879
It's a flashlight, it's a radio,
it's a cell-phone charger...

08:05.051 --> 08:07.076
...it's a siren and it's a compass.

08:08.454 --> 08:10.046
-North is that way.
-Handy.

08:10.223 --> 08:14.182
I've also got canned goods,
batteries, water, a gas mask...

08:14.360 --> 08:17.955
...and, that's right, North Korean currency,
because you just never know.

08:18.531 --> 08:21.989
Why are you wearing your jacket?
Are you cold? Let me get my space blanket.

08:22.235 --> 08:26.638
-lt preserves up to 80 percent body heat.
-A bit of bad news just in. Our first fatality.

08:26.806 --> 08:30.902
Not a lot of information.
A pedestrian hit by a downed power line--

08:36.948 --> 08:39.509
No reason to think it's anyone we know.

08:39.784 --> 08:41.980
Yeah, course not.

08:44.524 --> 08:48.722
Still, aren't families supposed to reach out
to each other in times of uncertainty?

08:48.895 --> 08:51.728
I know the phones are messed up,
but you got through to Sandy.

08:51.898 --> 08:54.332
And he was able to get through to Seth.

08:59.171 --> 09:01.298
Right, you're worried about your mom.

09:01.474 --> 09:04.500
Yeah. She gave birth to me.

09:04.677 --> 09:08.169
If I'm worried she may be hurt,
then shouldn't she be worried about me?

09:08.347 --> 09:09.780
We need to go there and check.

09:09.949 --> 09:11.610
-To her house?
-Yes, Ryan.

09:11.784 --> 09:14.912
I know my mom is a total bitch,
but she's still my mom.

09:15.087 --> 09:17.988
She doesn't drink a lot of milk,
so her bones are very brittle.

09:18.157 --> 09:19.886
She's always been scared of the dark.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.994
We can't go over there.
Seth and Summer are coming over here.

09:23.162 --> 09:24.857
What? Since when?

09:25.031 --> 09:27.192
Since Seth texted me
and said that they were.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.360
I thought Sandy said it was safest
to stay where we are.

09:30.536 --> 09:34.302
No, no, no. Sandy said that it's safer
for all of us to be together.

09:36.475 --> 09:39.808
All right, folks. We gotta remain calm,
and we gotta remain here.

09:39.979 --> 09:43.676
Anyone in need of medical attention,
please identify yourself to this gentleman.

09:44.383 --> 09:46.874
Everyone willing to help
anyone who might need it...

09:47.086 --> 09:48.986
...come over
and introduce yourself to me.

09:49.155 --> 09:51.385
The good news is,
we got everything we need here.

09:51.557 --> 09:54.048
We got shelter. We got food.
We got water.

09:54.226 --> 09:56.524
We got fine literature, chips and salsa.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.026
So if we all stay together...

09:59.198 --> 10:02.167
...we can get through this
no problem, all right?

10:02.335 --> 10:05.270
-Sure, that's good.
-All right.

10:05.438 --> 10:09.431
-This is like Berkeley, 1 989.
-You say that so warmly.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.770
Not that I'm fond of natural disasters...

10:11.944 --> 10:16.608
...but there is nothing sexier than
your husband calming an angry mob.

10:17.016 --> 10:18.813
Are you okay?

10:18.985 --> 10:21.647
I know I've been complaining
about Newport a lot lately...

10:21.821 --> 10:24.449
...but it just breaks my heart
to see it like this.

10:24.857 --> 10:27.621
-I'm gonna pass these out.
-All right.

10:29.729 --> 10:33.324
-Hello?
-Sandy, I'm glad I finally got ahold of you.

10:33.499 --> 10:35.558
-Are you with Ryan?
-Oh, no, Frank.

10:35.735 --> 10:38.863
But he's at the Cooper house with Taylor.
He's fine. We're all fine.

10:39.071 --> 10:42.529
That's great news. And Julie and Kaitlin,
they're at the house too, right?

10:42.708 --> 10:44.175
That I don't know.

10:44.343 --> 10:46.675
-Any idea where they might be?
-I'm sorry, I don't.

10:46.846 --> 10:49.406
But I'm sure they're gonna try
to get in touch with you.

10:49.582 --> 10:54.281
-And if I hear anything at all, I'll call you.
-Yeah. Yeah, thanks, Sandy.

10:55.554 --> 10:56.543
Great.

10:58.224 --> 11:00.749
Okay, Gary, how's it look up there?

11:00.926 --> 11:03.451
Can you climb down and get some help?

11:04.130 --> 11:06.030
Not really.

11:07.967 --> 11:10.629
Why not? What's going on?

11:10.970 --> 11:12.767
We're on an island, all alone.

11:13.272 --> 11:17.402
We appreciate the imagery and all that,
but this is no time for existential metaphors.

11:17.610 --> 11:19.942
No, really.

11:20.112 --> 11:22.307
The pier's been washed out.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.611
-Summer, you're okay.
-I'm so glad to see you.

11:27.820 --> 11:30.015
-Hey, where's Ryan?
-He's--

11:30.423 --> 11:31.913
Hey.

11:33.926 --> 11:36.895
-Hey, Atwood. I gotta look for Pancakes.
-I'm gonna go with you.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.531
Great. While you guys do that,
Ryan and I will....

11:39.699 --> 11:42.395
-Go.
-Yeah, we're gonna go.

11:42.568 --> 11:44.331
-Where you gonna go?
-We just got here.

11:44.503 --> 11:46.198
-We need supplies.
-I have supplies.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.170
No, I know, but who knows
how long those will last?

11:49.375 --> 11:52.401
Yeah, there'll be a run,
especially when the zombies come out.

11:52.611 --> 11:53.976
-Seth.
-Ryan.

11:54.146 --> 11:58.674
Look, guys, we'll be fine. Just stay here,
lock the doors, don't open them.

11:59.018 --> 12:01.612
Summer, Pancakes needs you right now.

12:03.856 --> 12:06.484
-Be careful.
-Okay, come back soon.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.217
-Okay.
-Later.

12:11.130 --> 12:12.461
What's up?

12:12.631 --> 12:14.531
Don't you think
the boys are acting weird?

12:14.700 --> 12:18.101
The shifty looks, finishing each other's
sentences like they're composing a lie?

12:18.270 --> 12:20.135
-Yes.
-Totally normal for them.

12:20.306 --> 12:23.742
I don't know.
I feel like they're hiding something.

12:24.343 --> 12:27.471
If it's not the location of Pancakes,
I'm not interested.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.772
Oh, no.

12:30.716 --> 12:33.150
He was in his cage. He's gone.

12:33.319 --> 12:35.014
Oh, no.

12:35.521 --> 12:37.148
-Pancakes.
-Pancakes.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.952
-Pancakes.
-I didn't wanna worry Taylor.

12:42.128 --> 12:44.528
She's pretty upset.
She's got this thing about blood.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.665
-Blood?
-Yeah. Don't freak, okay?

12:46.832 --> 12:50.529
-I need you to not freak.
-Okay. Why would I freak out?

13:01.380 --> 13:02.745
It's not that bad, is it?

13:06.719 --> 13:08.550
Dude, it's bad.

13:35.681 --> 13:37.615
Seth, the hospital's like a mile away.

13:37.783 --> 13:42.243
I know, which is why I'm taking a secret
back-roads way that's only a half mile.

13:42.488 --> 13:45.321
That was sarcasm.
I'm pretty sure my shortcut got us lost.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.016
Well, the ocean's on one side,
the land's on the other.

13:48.194 --> 13:50.162
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

13:50.729 --> 13:53.789
-That was sarcasm too. Sorry.
-No, hey, so you're a little on edge.

13:53.966 --> 13:56.434
A giant glass spear in the back
will do that to a guy.

13:56.602 --> 14:00.868
-It's not a spear.
-ls it more of a spike or a skewer?

14:01.040 --> 14:04.874
Dude, you're doing a terrible job
of trying to keep my mind off the pain.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.444
Talk about something else,
not the cause of the pain.

14:07.613 --> 14:08.807
The real question is:

14:08.981 --> 14:11.449
What are you doing to keep
my mind off of your pain?

14:11.617 --> 14:15.018
Because right now, you're not
looking too good. I'm starting to feel--

14:18.424 --> 14:20.551
-What was that?
-Sounds like we hit something.

14:20.726 --> 14:23.092
Oh, God, not a body.

14:23.762 --> 14:25.821
All right. Well, pull over or something.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.999
-All right, go out and check.
-With the zombies?

15:16.048 --> 15:18.642
You guys are amazing.

15:18.951 --> 15:21.784
-No, we're not. It's just something we do.
-No.

15:21.954 --> 15:25.014
I used to sing that to Kaitlin
when she was little and scared.

15:25.190 --> 15:29.251
Isn't that kind of inappropriate? I mean,
given the sexual content of the lyrics.

15:29.428 --> 15:31.589
It was the only song
she knew all the words to.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.494
That and "Pour Some Sugar On Me."

15:34.667 --> 15:35.895
Well, this is really fun.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.866
Staying up late,
eating sweets, singing songs.

15:39.038 --> 15:40.665
It's like summer camp.

15:40.839 --> 15:43.603
Co-ed summer camp,
with really hot camp counselors.

15:43.776 --> 15:47.143
No offense, Gary,
but this is barely entertaining me.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.645
Yeah, Gary. Young guy in Newport,
cool job.

15:49.815 --> 15:52.147
You must have a lot of fun.

15:52.351 --> 15:54.319
-Not really.
-No friends?

15:54.486 --> 15:56.545
No girls?

15:56.722 --> 15:59.122
Well, there is one girl.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.816
Well, you only need one,
as long as it's a good one.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.860
-She's an amazing one.
-Well, are you guys serious?

16:06.332 --> 16:09.859
Pretty serious. You know, thinking
about taking it to the next level.

16:10.035 --> 16:12.265
The next level? That's very serious.

16:12.438 --> 16:15.430
Yeah, and you haven't
asked her out yet, have you?

16:15.607 --> 16:17.006
Not yet, no.

16:17.176 --> 16:20.976
Well, what's the holdup?
I mean, if she's as hot as she sounds....

16:21.146 --> 16:23.614
It's not her, it's me.

16:23.782 --> 16:29.721
She's a great girl,
and I'm the ice-cream guy.

16:33.025 --> 16:35.152
What the hell?
We have nothing better to do.

16:35.327 --> 16:38.922
-Yep, today is your lucky day.
-Awesome.

16:39.131 --> 16:40.564
I mean, wait. What do you mean?

16:41.200 --> 16:43.691
Well, first, we have to get rid
of that dorky bow tie.

16:43.869 --> 16:45.860
Yeah, and an apron is friend to no man.

16:46.472 --> 16:48.906
Surely we can do something
with this hair.

16:49.074 --> 16:51.338
I think I have some nail scissors
in my purse.

16:53.178 --> 16:55.408
I can't get anyone on the phone.

16:55.581 --> 16:58.880
It's okay. I'll walk you through it.
Just open up the back door.

17:00.386 --> 17:01.819
It's easy. Don't worry.

17:01.987 --> 17:04.648
You're asking me to use tools
and exert myself physically.

17:04.823 --> 17:06.688
I think we both know
where this is going.

17:06.858 --> 17:10.260
Yeah, okay. Well, start by putting
the jack under the frame...

17:10.429 --> 17:12.420
...by the door there, yeah.

17:12.598 --> 17:15.192
-The jack's this thing with the handle, right?
-Yeah.

17:16.969 --> 17:21.406
Actually, wait. First, loosen the bolts
with that wrench.

17:24.009 --> 17:25.874
All right.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.983
There we go.

17:33.886 --> 17:35.751
Okay.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.648
You may find this hard to believe, Ryan...

17:40.826 --> 17:43.761
...but when I was younger,
I used to be a bit of a worrier.

17:43.962 --> 17:45.190
You don't say.

17:45.364 --> 17:49.266
To distract myself from worrying,
I would sometimes make lists.

17:49.468 --> 17:52.301
It didn't matter what the lists were of,
it could be anything.

17:52.471 --> 17:56.703
Every cereal I've ever eaten, or the names
of every planet mentioned in Star Wars.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.206
Whatever.

18:00.879 --> 18:04.315
-You wanna make a list, Seth?
-Oh, yeah. Whatever. Sure, if you want to.

18:04.483 --> 18:07.145
We could start with everyone
you've punched in the face...

18:07.319 --> 18:08.877
...since moving to Newport.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.648
First would be Luke
at Holly's beach house.

18:15.394 --> 18:18.363
-Yeah, and number two would be Luke.
-Right, at the diner.

18:18.530 --> 18:22.626
-Yeah, and again at the model home.
-What about Holly's dad at cotillion?

18:22.835 --> 18:25.429
-That was more of a tackle.
-Which takes us back to Luke.

18:25.604 --> 18:27.834
Yeah. TJ.

18:33.512 --> 18:37.004
Summer, do you really think
Pancakes is in the attic?

18:37.950 --> 18:42.649
Like he pulled down the ladder,
hopped up and then put it away?

18:42.821 --> 18:45.551
Well, we've checked everywhere else.

18:45.724 --> 18:46.952
Light.

18:47.392 --> 18:49.121
Be careful.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.366
Oh, gross.

19:01.006 --> 19:02.997
-It's okay.
-What is that?

19:03.709 --> 19:05.768
-That's Uncle Alistair.
-That's your uncle?

19:05.944 --> 19:08.640
Yeah. No. It's my dad's skeleton
from med school.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.009
He calls him Uncle Alistair.
I don't know why.

19:11.183 --> 19:13.310
I don't wanna meet
any of your other relatives.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.646
-Let's just find Pancakes and go.
-Okay.

19:15.821 --> 19:17.379
-Pancakes.
-Pancakes.

19:17.556 --> 19:19.786
-Pancakes.
-Pancakes.

19:19.958 --> 19:22.017
Don't be afraid. It's just me.

19:22.194 --> 19:24.526
-Summer, you are such a good mother.
-Thanks.

19:24.863 --> 19:28.697
When I think of the lengths that you're
going to to save your adopted rabbit son...

19:28.867 --> 19:31.028
...and my mother can't even
pick up the phone...

19:31.203 --> 19:33.467
...and send a message saying,
"Hi, are you alive? "

19:33.639 --> 19:35.300
It's okay. You have us now.

19:35.474 --> 19:38.705
Seth and I rode on a bicycle
just so we could be here together.

19:38.877 --> 19:41.846
Julie and Kaitlin left a message,
and the Cohens asked about you.

19:42.014 --> 19:43.242
Yeah, I know. You're right.

19:43.415 --> 19:47.112
If there's one thing I've learned over
the years, it's you make your own family.

19:47.286 --> 19:50.585
It seems to me that you've scraped together
quite an awesome one.

19:50.756 --> 19:53.190
-Wait, what? Where?
-You hear that?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.891
In the vent. It's Pancakes.

19:56.094 --> 19:57.527
-Pancakes.
-Pancakes.

19:57.696 --> 20:00.927
-Pancakes.
-Pancakes. Here. Stay there, Pancakes.

20:07.639 --> 20:09.004
-Pancakes.
-There he is.

20:10.242 --> 20:12.073
Come on. Good boy.

20:12.244 --> 20:13.677
Come on.

20:16.114 --> 20:18.275
It's just an aftershock.
It'll stop in a second.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.077
Pancakes!

20:20.686 --> 20:22.745
-Oh, my God. Mom!
-Stay down.

20:36.668 --> 20:38.158
Kirsten?

20:50.882 --> 20:52.247
Kirsten?

20:53.318 --> 20:56.754
-Kirsten?
-Over here, Mr. Cohen.

21:00.492 --> 21:02.687
Sandy.

21:05.597 --> 21:08.031
Something is not right.

21:56.715 --> 21:59.616
Nothing works.
It's like a information blackout.

21:59.785 --> 22:03.312
Well, the aftershock probably
took out a power line or something.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.624
So listen, I'm gonna go on foot
and get help, I think.

22:06.792 --> 22:08.157
-No.
-Well, we can't stay here.

22:08.327 --> 22:11.296
-I don't even know where here is.
-Well, I'm going with you.

22:12.164 --> 22:15.531
No. It's cool. Listen, I'm gonna come back
as soon as I can. Promise.

22:16.168 --> 22:18.193
What about the zombies?

22:20.872 --> 22:24.069
That's a really good point. Okay.

22:26.812 --> 22:30.179
All right, buddy, we have to
keep you alert and on your feet.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.408
Now, when last we checked the list--

22:32.818 --> 22:34.718
-Need some help?
-Yeah.

22:34.886 --> 22:36.911
--we were on Trey.

22:37.089 --> 22:40.115
Now, correct me if I'm wrong,
but I believe we went from Trey...

22:40.292 --> 22:43.227
...to a lengthy Volchok period.

22:43.662 --> 22:46.597
Yeah. Hey, thanks for this.

22:46.765 --> 22:49.233
Yeah. Now, unless you hit
the Chili guy or Johnny.

22:49.401 --> 22:51.062
I know people were rooting for that.

22:51.236 --> 22:55.468
Well, I did punch Johnny's dad,
or a bounty hunter who worked for him.

22:55.640 --> 22:58.939
-Johnny's dad was a bounty hunter?
-Oh, yeah. I never told you that?

23:09.921 --> 23:12.856
Any available IV nurse to the ER.

23:13.024 --> 23:16.016
Excuse me, doctor. My wife
needs to see someone right away.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.093
-What happened?
-I fell down some stairs.

23:18.263 --> 23:20.458
-You break anything?
-I don't think so, but--

23:20.632 --> 23:23.362
-She needs help.
-Everyone here needs help, sir.

23:23.535 --> 23:26.936
-Fill out this form and wait your turn.
-She's pregnant.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.670
-Any bleeding?
-No, but something isn't right.

23:30.842 --> 23:33.777
I'm sorry.
Try to make yourself comfortable.

23:34.679 --> 23:35.907
-Hang on a second.
-Sandy--

23:36.081 --> 23:39.676
Hang on one second, all right?
Be right back. Excuse me, doctor.

23:42.521 --> 23:45.922
My wife would never complain.
She'd never put her needs before anybody.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.786
But I'm not that proud and selfless.

23:47.959 --> 23:50.655
I'm begging you, please,
to give her and our baby priority.

23:50.829 --> 23:53.423
-I'd like to help, really. But--
-You can have my spot.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.964
-Richard Weitz.
-That's me. Go.

24:00.705 --> 24:02.730
Thank you. Honey.

24:03.475 --> 24:06.967
Well, great. We're out of candles,
and now all the ice cream's melted.

24:07.145 --> 24:08.373
Please, stop worrying.

24:08.547 --> 24:11.607
Stop worrying?
We're about to be washed out to sea.

24:12.217 --> 24:16.711
-I'm sorry. You're right.
-I'm right? I thought I was exaggerating.

24:17.722 --> 24:20.247
-I'm going up there.
-To do what?

24:20.425 --> 24:22.552
-To go swim out to shore?
-I don't know.

24:22.727 --> 24:24.661
Assess the situation. Figure it out.

24:25.363 --> 24:26.990
I'm your mother. It's my job.

24:28.700 --> 24:30.190
Wait!

24:30.602 --> 24:32.467
-You can't do that.
-Why not?

24:32.637 --> 24:37.438
Because I'm having
an asthma attack from the stress.

24:38.076 --> 24:41.603
-Oh, my God. Do you have an inhaler?
-Or, like, an EpiPen? I could stab you.

24:41.780 --> 24:44.578
Maybe we could just sing "Night Moves"?

24:45.951 --> 24:47.179
I think it might calm me.

24:47.352 --> 24:48.819
-Really?
-Please.

24:56.394 --> 24:59.158
That's good. That's good.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.732
I think he needs, like, CPR or something.

25:02.934 --> 25:05.528
I learned this when I was
in Junior Lifeguards, okay?

25:10.809 --> 25:13.403
Oh, gross.
What the heck was the tongue for?

25:13.578 --> 25:15.546
He tried to kiss me.

25:15.947 --> 25:19.246
-I'm sorry.
-Young man, what is going on?

25:23.221 --> 25:26.019
Oh, my-- The girl you like?

25:27.392 --> 25:29.690
Oh, you've gotta be kidding me.

25:29.861 --> 25:32.921
Pancakes.
I think I hear something this way.

25:33.098 --> 25:35.225
Summer, how can
we keep looking for Pancakes...

25:35.400 --> 25:37.425
...when there's a giant elephant
in the room?

25:37.602 --> 25:40.594
We walk around the elephant.
It may be big, but we are crafty.

25:40.772 --> 25:43.002
The boys should've been back.
Aren't you worried?

25:43.174 --> 25:46.405
No, I'm not. I'm terrified.
That's why I'm focusing on Pancakes...

25:46.578 --> 25:49.411
...not on the fact my boyfriend
could be ravaged by zombies.

25:49.581 --> 25:52.141
-Let's go look for them.
-ln what? They took the car.

25:52.317 --> 25:53.545
I already thought of that.

25:53.718 --> 25:56.186
Let's listen to the radio
and see if there's any news.

25:56.354 --> 25:58.788
The radio stopped working
with the aftershock.

25:58.957 --> 26:00.515
What was that?

26:00.692 --> 26:03.024
-Pancakes?
-Maybe it was Ryan and Seth.

26:03.194 --> 26:06.391
-Why would they need to break a window?
-I don't know. What do we do?

26:08.066 --> 26:09.397
Quick. Hide.

26:11.069 --> 26:13.299
No, no, no. Summer, wait.
I've got a better idea.

26:13.471 --> 26:15.302
Summer, come here!

26:16.141 --> 26:19.599
-You got a makeover under false pretenses.
-You lied about having asthma.

26:19.811 --> 26:22.712
-Do you even like Bob Seger?
-I'm sorry.

26:22.881 --> 26:24.405
I don't know why I did it.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.108
I mean, I do know, but I'm embarrassed.

26:28.420 --> 26:30.388
Kaitlin, you come in here all the time...

26:30.555 --> 26:33.456
...and you look right through me
like I don't even exist.

26:34.693 --> 26:36.524
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

26:36.695 --> 26:40.654
I mean, why would a girl like you
pay any attention to a guy like me?

26:42.200 --> 26:45.863
I know the only reason you'd ever
get to know me is if you had no choice.

26:46.905 --> 26:49.772
Tonight, that happened,
and it felt like fate.

26:52.644 --> 26:54.635
I didn't want it to end.

26:55.580 --> 26:57.639
I guess, I mean, that's understandable.

27:00.452 --> 27:02.750
But what do you mean,
you didn't want it to end?

27:04.155 --> 27:05.645
-What the--?
-Mom.

27:05.824 --> 27:07.621
It's okay.

27:11.830 --> 27:13.297
-Frank!
-Just got your message.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.296
-I was so worried.
-Oh, me too.

27:17.736 --> 27:20.728
Go for it.
There was a flipping earthquake.

27:24.242 --> 27:26.767
But wait. How did you get here?
What about the pier?

27:28.179 --> 27:30.079
What about it? The pier's fine.

27:35.920 --> 27:38.855
-There's a heartbeat.
-Thank God.

27:39.024 --> 27:42.516
The baby's under stress.
And after a fall, there can be a rupture.

27:44.696 --> 27:46.926
-Separation.
-Can you treat that?

27:50.735 --> 27:52.202
We still have some tests to run.

27:58.343 --> 27:59.867
Okay, I've always wondered this.

28:00.045 --> 28:04.482
In your opinion, who is a better
food-industry server, I guess?

28:04.649 --> 28:07.618
Chloe, the magical waitress
from Albuquerque...

28:07.786 --> 28:11.222
...or Donnie, the angry busboy
who shot Luke?

28:11.489 --> 28:14.390
-I'd go with Chloe on that one.
-Good. That's what I figured.

28:14.559 --> 28:15.890
Okay, desert island:

28:16.061 --> 28:18.529
Sadie, the tough-as-nails-yet-soulful
jewelry maker...

28:18.697 --> 28:22.133
...or Lindsay, my grandfather's
illegitimate love child.

28:22.300 --> 28:24.700
-I can't, Seth.
-Sure you can. It's very easy.

28:24.869 --> 28:26.632
Go on. Just go.

28:26.805 --> 28:29.069
I'm not gonna go alone.

28:29.974 --> 28:34.741
We need help, man. I need help.
Just lay me down, okay?

28:56.067 --> 29:00.231
-Okay, but I'm gonna come right back.
-I know.

29:19.858 --> 29:23.225
-Do you hear that?
-No.

29:23.394 --> 29:25.555
Exactly. It's quiet now.
Maybe they moved on.

29:25.730 --> 29:29.962
Or maybe they're just faking us out.

29:30.135 --> 29:32.933
There we go. Locked and loaded,
just how Mama likes it.

29:33.104 --> 29:35.504
Taylor, a gun? Where did you get that?
Are you crazy?

29:35.673 --> 29:39.541
It's Jimmy Cooper's flare gun. I found it
in the closet while looking for rain gear.

29:39.711 --> 29:41.679
-It's not raining.
-This was last November.

29:42.347 --> 29:44.247
What? Jimmy doesn't need it anymore.

29:44.415 --> 29:48.681
It's cold, and it's shiny, and it feels
so good in my-- Here, you try it.

29:48.853 --> 29:51.845
I'm not touching your pistol.
That is stupid and dangerous.

29:54.659 --> 29:56.354
Oh, my God.

29:56.995 --> 30:01.022
-Go 1 87 on that zombie ass.
-It's in the kitchen.

30:01.232 --> 30:03.257
Follow me.

30:04.936 --> 30:06.335
-Okay.
-Okay.

30:16.648 --> 30:17.706
Stop or I'll shoot!

30:23.888 --> 30:26.823
-Oh, my God! I've been hit!
-Mom?

30:27.892 --> 30:31.157
-What?
-Taylor, you shot me.

30:34.899 --> 30:35.888
Sorry.

30:51.616 --> 30:53.846
I came here
because I was worried about you.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.384
I know. It really means
a lot to me that you did.

30:56.554 --> 30:59.990
Save it. That's the last maternal instinct
I'll have, since you shot me.

31:00.191 --> 31:04.184
-lt was just a toe nick. You're totally fine.
-Until sandal season.

31:04.362 --> 31:06.421
I'm gonna have to see a plastic surgeon.

31:06.598 --> 31:11.092
There's no way to get you to the hospital.
You're just gonna have to tough it out.

31:11.669 --> 31:13.466
-Pancakes is hurt.
-What?

31:13.638 --> 31:15.663
-Oh, no.
-A rabbit?

31:15.874 --> 31:18.843
-I found him in the garage. He was limping.
-Let me see. Careful.

31:19.010 --> 31:21.274
Baby. Oh, come here.

31:22.814 --> 31:26.648
Let me see.
You know, he seems like he's okay.

31:26.818 --> 31:29.787
-Maybe it's a sprain.
-I can't take a chance. I have to get help.

31:29.954 --> 31:33.082
-You can't. It's too dangerous.
-I can't wait here any longer, okay?

31:33.258 --> 31:36.125
I have a missing boyfriend
and a sick rabbit.

31:36.294 --> 31:39.092
And I cannot listen to any more
of your mother's whining.

31:41.833 --> 31:44.427
Okay, I'll go with you.
We'll brave the zombies together.

31:44.602 --> 31:46.866
We're gonna need to take Pancakes
to the hospital.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.665
-This carrion gets help but not me?
-We don't have a car.

31:49.841 --> 31:52.071
You can't walk.
There's no way to get you there.

31:52.243 --> 31:54.734
I risked my life
and hoofed it from Emerald Bay.

31:54.913 --> 31:57.677
And you're just gonna
leave me here to rot?

31:58.483 --> 32:01.077
I have an idea,
but I don't think you're gonna like it.

32:10.461 --> 32:13.919
-This is not okay with me.
-Well, I told you you wouldn't like it.

32:14.098 --> 32:17.465
Mom, it's not that far to the hospital,
and it's kind of this or nothing.

32:18.536 --> 32:20.265
Fine, but I'm not holding the rabbit.

32:21.005 --> 32:23.496
Unless you promise
I can make a vest out of him.

32:23.675 --> 32:25.108
I'll carry Pancakes.

32:28.079 --> 32:29.808
Okay.

32:36.587 --> 32:40.546
-Kaitlin, if you'll just listen--
-I heard you. You're sorry. I get it.

32:40.725 --> 32:44.183
Truthfully? I'm not sorry.

32:44.362 --> 32:47.525
-Tonight was the best night of my life.
-Gary.

32:47.699 --> 32:50.463
Given the chance,
I'd do everything exactly the same.

32:51.669 --> 32:54.968
-Kaitlin, honey, you coming?
-Oh, yeah. Just give me one second.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.908
Okay. We'll wait for you in the car.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.173
Look, I should go.
But I am into ice cream...

33:02.347 --> 33:04.872
...and you're obviously hooked up
as far as that goes.

33:06.084 --> 33:08.848
And the makeover
was pretty successful.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.885
And the asthma attack had me fooled.

33:11.055 --> 33:12.920
Sweet.

33:14.459 --> 33:18.361
So I guess once you guys get this place
back up and running, I'll come stop by.

33:18.997 --> 33:21.431
Gold Medal Ribbon on the house.

33:28.206 --> 33:31.334
Best earthquake ever.

33:31.542 --> 33:34.568
Any cardiologists, please call 2 1 67.

33:34.746 --> 33:36.338
Any cardiologists, please call....

33:36.514 --> 33:38.607
Dr. Harris, are those my wife's tests?

33:38.783 --> 33:40.910
No. It'll be a while
before we get the results.

33:41.085 --> 33:44.953
Of course. It's a little bit too soon for that.
I know you have your hands full.

33:45.123 --> 33:46.920
Yes, we have a pretty full house.

33:47.458 --> 33:51.258
As soon as you know anything, good
or bad, if you could please let me know--

33:51.462 --> 33:55.558
-I will, of course.
-Let me know first, so I can prepare my wife.

33:56.834 --> 33:58.165
Of course. Thank you.

33:58.336 --> 34:02.796
It's kind of crazy in that we have two
other boys that are going off to college...

34:02.974 --> 34:05.101
...so we were expecting
to have an empty nest.

34:05.309 --> 34:09.609
You know, and then, all of a sudden,
this unplanned miraculous event....

34:09.781 --> 34:12.045
And, well, the fact of the matter is...

34:12.216 --> 34:14.980
...I can't imagine anything worse
than an empty nest, so....

34:18.089 --> 34:22.422
Anything you can do
for that little baby, please do it.

34:22.592 --> 34:24.322
I'll get out of your hair right now.

34:24.495 --> 34:27.726
-I'll come find you. Yes.
-I'll be right there, all right? Okay.

34:36.107 --> 34:38.074
Feel that?

34:42.679 --> 34:44.670
-Darryl?
-Hey, Seth.

34:44.849 --> 34:48.614
-How's the earthquake treating you?
-Not too well. I need to ask for your help.

34:48.786 --> 34:51.152
Sure, but how can I help you?

34:51.322 --> 34:53.813
Well, I'm guessing you don't have a--

34:53.991 --> 34:55.891
Like, a car or a walkie-talkie....

34:56.094 --> 34:59.996
This shopping cart's
my only worldly possession.

35:00.331 --> 35:05.132
-I'm afraid I'm gonna have to ask for it.
-Sorry. No way. I'll give you my pants.

35:05.303 --> 35:07.771
No, no. They look better on you. Listen.

35:09.574 --> 35:11.667
It has a flat tire
and possibly a broken axel.

35:11.843 --> 35:14.971
But it's a $70,000 car,
and it's all yours in exchange for the cart.

35:15.146 --> 35:16.909
Sweet.

35:21.219 --> 35:23.210
Stay here.
I'll come back to draw you a map.

35:26.891 --> 35:29.758
-Because it's a rabbit.
-It's a "he."

35:29.927 --> 35:33.294
And I'm aware of his species,
but that doesn't mean he doesn't feel pain.

35:33.498 --> 35:36.899
Please, if you have a shred of humanity
or animality in your body...

35:37.068 --> 35:41.266
...you won't deprive this poor little
adorable bunny of quality medical care.

35:44.208 --> 35:47.075
Well, I did do a year
at veterinarian school.

35:47.245 --> 35:49.008
Really?

35:49.680 --> 35:52.308
Maybe if there's
an x-ray machine free, I'll--

35:52.483 --> 35:55.316
Thank you. Thank you.

35:58.256 --> 36:01.350
I still can't believe that guy
kept us there for no reason.

36:01.526 --> 36:03.926
I don't know.
I think his reasons are pretty good.

36:04.095 --> 36:07.724
When a guy gets around a girl he's crazy
about, reason goes out the window.

36:07.899 --> 36:10.390
He forgets to take things slow.

36:11.702 --> 36:14.865
Sometimes when a girl gets around a guy
she's not too crazy about...

36:15.072 --> 36:17.700
...she does
some pretty stupid things too.

36:18.709 --> 36:22.907
I'm sorry for posting your mug shot up
in the ladies' room at Taylor's birthday.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.310
It showed a lot of creativity.

36:25.483 --> 36:28.509
Speaking of creativity, Kaitlin.
Clown porn?

36:28.686 --> 36:30.677
I'm not even gonna ask
where that came from.

36:30.855 --> 36:33.289
I found that in Dr. Roberts' study.

36:35.359 --> 36:38.260
You guys'll believe absolutely anything.

36:38.429 --> 36:40.954
Hey, Frank, have you ever
considered cutting your hair?

36:41.132 --> 36:42.997
Is that Seth?

36:50.675 --> 36:52.142
Oh, my God. Pull over.

36:53.678 --> 36:56.704
Mom, I'm really sorry I shot you.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.247
I know we don't always get along...

37:00.251 --> 37:02.378
...but I really love you.

37:12.496 --> 37:14.464
I love you too.

37:24.475 --> 37:27.638
I don't think I've ever
heard you say that before.

37:29.513 --> 37:32.448
Taylor, that's why I went to Julie's.

37:33.884 --> 37:36.785
After the earthquake happened,
all I could think about was you.

37:36.954 --> 37:38.080
Oh, my God, Mom. Me too.

37:40.791 --> 37:44.318
I was shot because I was such
a total failure as a mother...

37:45.663 --> 37:48.928
...it never even occurred to you
that I would come looking for you.

37:49.200 --> 37:52.328
But you did, so....

37:54.705 --> 37:58.505
-So....
-Mom.

38:19.297 --> 38:21.026
Hey.

38:21.232 --> 38:22.665
Hey.

38:25.036 --> 38:27.368
This is the point where
I'm supposed to tell you...

38:27.538 --> 38:30.996
...that you gave us all quite a scare.
Except I was never scared.

38:31.175 --> 38:33.643
Oh, yeah. I know that.
Me, on the other hand....

38:33.811 --> 38:35.608
The doctors say you're gonna be fine.

38:35.780 --> 38:38.374
Although you'll have to wrap
your head around the fact...

38:38.549 --> 38:40.414
...that we're really brothers now.

38:41.085 --> 38:42.643
We're blood brothers.

38:43.721 --> 38:45.188
You donated blood?

38:46.357 --> 38:48.791
I had an extra few pints flowing
through my veins.

38:48.959 --> 38:50.824
It was no big deal.

38:51.562 --> 38:54.531
-You're not a big fan of needles.
-Nor of fainting, it turns out.

38:54.699 --> 38:58.157
But the bank was a little low, and us
O-negative guys gotta stick together.

38:59.637 --> 39:00.865
That's weird.

39:01.038 --> 39:03.131
All of a sudden,
I have this strange urge...

39:03.307 --> 39:06.572
...to listen to Death Cab
and read comic books.

39:07.611 --> 39:08.976
-For real?
-No, I'm kidding.

39:09.146 --> 39:12.343
That's too bad. If we could've turned this
into a body-swap comedy...

39:12.516 --> 39:15.542
...we could've squeezed
another year or two out of this.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.518
So listen, I don't know
if I said this at all today, but--

39:18.723 --> 39:20.315
You did.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.960
But after all the times you've saved me,
I was up, so....

39:27.932 --> 39:29.160
All right.

39:29.834 --> 39:33.326
Where's everyone else?
How are the girls, Kirsten, Sandy?

39:33.504 --> 39:34.801
The girls are fine.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.905
Veronica Townsend and Pancakes,
however, have matching casts.

39:39.076 --> 39:44.309
And Frank is here with Julie and Kaitlin.
He gave me a ride, brought you here.

39:44.482 --> 39:48.043
But my mom and dad are doing some tests
with the doctor, because she fell.

39:49.019 --> 39:50.782
Is it bad?

39:52.590 --> 39:54.080
-Hey, boys.
-Mom.

39:54.258 --> 39:56.089
Hey, I'm so sorry.

39:57.027 --> 40:00.758
Everything's fine. The baby's okay.

40:01.298 --> 40:02.890
She's okay.

40:03.067 --> 40:05.399
-She?
-It's a girl.

41:50.241 --> 41:52.641
Sweet. Cool.

42:14.198 --> 42:16.325
It looks like the old girl
held up pretty good.

42:16.500 --> 42:19.560
I can't wait to have a hot shower
with the hot water we don't have.

42:19.737 --> 42:23.400
-I'll settle for sleeping in my own bed.
-Or sleeping anywhere.

42:23.574 --> 42:27.340
Come on, I'll fire up the grill.
We'll get the camp stove going. It'll be fun.

43:08.285 --> 43:09.684
Oh, my God.
