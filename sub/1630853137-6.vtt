10:17.958 --> 10:21.166
I accept the Scales

10:21.458 --> 10:24.375
They lack balance

protect the travelers of the night...

11:55.416 --> 11:57.125
Why would I ever sign up for that?

12:33.416 --> 12:34.416
How?

12:34.750 --> 12:37.083
KHONSHU: Only an Avatar can do it.

12:37.833 --> 12:39.791
I said "no."

12:42.250 --> 12:46.791
Let us purify the souls of Cairo
and then the world.

I cannot allow you to proceed.

but never had.

He's gone, Marc. The Duat has him.

13:48.958 --> 13:51.166
Please enjoy your peace.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.583
We need to go back for him.

14:06.666 --> 14:08.125
It doesn't work like that.

14:08.583 --> 14:10.833
Leave here, and you can't return.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.375
Anyway, you don't need him anymore, Marc.

14:15.541 --> 14:18.083

and he just...

14:18.916 --> 14:20.666

I survived because I knew I wasn't alone.

You were always there,
alive, full of hope.
