00:26.658 --> 00:27.826

00:27.826 --> 00:31.538
We've been assigned to pick up
Vice Admiral Christie from Outpost 35

00:31.538 --> 00:34.499
and then transport him
to rendezvous with a Krill vessel.

00:34.499 --> 00:37.002
Once there,
the Admiral will begin negotiations

00:37.002 --> 00:39.838
to allow Union access
to the Naklav Sector.

00:39.838 --> 00:41.882

00:41.882 --> 00:44.635

Union ships have never had a conduit.

00:44.635 --> 00:46.052
Until now.

00:46.052 --> 00:49.681
- Early indications are that,
with treaty negotiations going smoothly,

00:49.681 --> 00:53.101
the Krill may be willing
to permit passage, which means...

00:53.101 --> 00:56.647

are gonna be wide open.

00:56.647 --> 00:58.732
- Does he believe we can trust them?

00:58.732 --> 01:02.068
- That's the word.
Christie's one of the top Union diplomats.

01:02.068 --> 01:05.155
He was the guy who negotiated
the Din'jon Accords.

01:05.155 --> 01:07.699
- So if this all goes through,
will we be able to get in on it?

01:07.699 --> 01:10.661
- Well, we were the ones
who shepherded the Lock Vai pact,

01:10.661 --> 01:14.498
and we are an exploration vessel,
so I would say our odds are pretty good.

02:16.810 --> 02:20.230
- Whoa, at ease.
What's with the formality?

02:20.230 --> 02:23.943

or do I need to make an appointment?

02:27.487 --> 02:28.864

You always had the heart of an explorer.

It was only a matter of time before
you left the university for the universe.

behind a desk,

so whenever a mission like this
comes along, I jump at the chance.

03:14.827 --> 03:18.705
And I must admit, seeing your name
on the crew manifest

03:18.705 --> 03:21.207
gave me a little extra incentive.

I was a medical student at Union Point.
He was one of my professors.

Then, six months later, we got married.

The official story was that
we'd only been together a short time

09:37.418 --> 09:40.837

but I don't think anyone was fooled.

09:40.837 --> 09:42.965

I don't think he really wanted a wife.

He wanted someone young and smiling

after a long day's work.

The pain can be worse
when you're the one ending things.

dumped than be the dumper.

11:25.775 --> 11:27.403
and we are prepared to grant it.

11:27.403 --> 11:29.779
But there are certain conditions.

11:29.779 --> 11:31.448
- We're listening.

11:31.448 --> 11:35.035
- There is an uninhabited planet
in Union space

11:35.035 --> 11:36.537
that is rich in harcarium.

11:36.537 --> 11:38.914
We use it in our propulsion systems.

11:38.914 --> 11:41.291
We wish to secure extraction rights.

11:41.291 --> 11:45.003
- Where?
- The third planet in the Obrall system.

11:45.003 --> 11:46.796
- Well, I think that can be arranged.

11:46.796 --> 11:49.799
I'll need to get approval
from the Union Council, of course.

11:49.799 --> 11:52.469
- Passage will be allowed
for one vessel alone.

11:52.469 --> 11:53.803
If there are no...

11:53.803 --> 11:57.307

we will consider further allowances.

11:57.307 --> 12:00.936

object to getting the first solo crack

12:00.936 --> 12:02.563

12:02.563 --> 12:04.607
- No, sir, we would not.

follow this course to the Naklav Sector.

12:10.362 --> 12:12.948
Any deviation will be forbidden to you.

12:12.948 --> 12:15.825

to get there,

12:15.825 --> 12:17.494
but it shouldn't be a problem.

12:17.494 --> 12:18.537
Anything else?

12:18.537 --> 12:20.497
- Upon entry into our territory,

12:20.497 --> 12:22.999
a tracking beacon will be installed
on your ship

12:22.999 --> 12:26.086
so we can monitor
your coordinates at all times.

12:26.086 --> 12:28.714
- That would be a violation
of our security protocols.

12:28.714 --> 12:32.175
- I think it's all right, Commander.
We really don't have anything to hide.

12:32.175 --> 12:33.636

12:34.261 --> 12:37.640
- I'm sure we can find
a way to accommodate.

12:37.640 --> 12:41.017
- We have little to no information
about the regions beyond your space

12:41.017 --> 12:42.686
that we intend to explore.

12:42.686 --> 12:46.732
Anything your cartographers could share
with us would be greatly appreciated,

12:46.732 --> 12:49.443

12:51.236 --> 12:52.571

12:52.571 --> 12:55.782

12:55.782 --> 12:56.950
- Why wouldn't we?

12:56.950 --> 12:58.827
- It is a domain of evil.

12:59.495 --> 13:01.455
- What do you mean?

13:01.455 --> 13:04.667
- Demons dwell within the Expanse.

13:04.667 --> 13:06.543
- Could you be a little more specific?

13:06.543 --> 13:10.380
- The Anhkana warns of Shadow Realms.

13:10.380 --> 13:12.675
Gateways to the depths of the underworld,

13:12.675 --> 13:14.259
where demons lie in wait

13:14.259 --> 13:18.972
to possess the souls of those
who dare to stray within their reach.

13:19.556 --> 13:21.600
They corrupt all that is holy.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.520
Within their grasp,
even the most righteous

13:24.520 --> 13:29.316
can be forced to commit
unspeakable acts of depravity.

13:29.316 --> 13:34.070
- Do you have any direct evidence
that these "demons" really exist?

13:34.070 --> 13:38.116
- It is written in the Anhkana.
That is all the evidence we need.

13:38.116 --> 13:41.995
- We appreciate the warning,
and we'll take every precaution,

13:41.995 --> 13:45.207
but that area covers
more than half the sector.

13:45.207 --> 13:47.042
We are explorers.

13:47.042 --> 13:52.047
So if it's all the same to you, we'd like
to see for ourselves what's out there.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.427
- We will not stop you.

13:56.427 --> 13:59.597
But do not expect us to save you.

14:15.987 --> 14:18.031
- Consul, Ambassador.

14:18.031 --> 14:22.077
We wish you safe travels, and we want
to thank you again for your generosity.

47:52.879 --> 47:54.423

47:55.549 --> 47:57.926

to Admiral Christie.

48:00.053 --> 48:02.848
- Demonic possession.
- Huh?

48:02.848 --> 48:07.227
- The Krill warned us that
this part of space was inhabited by...

48:07.227 --> 48:10.689

take possession of your soul.

rewriting his DNA,

his transmutation was accelerating.

48:29.416 --> 48:31.293

48:37.508 --> 48:38.759

48:38.759 --> 48:42.513
It may be that their natural means
of procreation

48:42.513 --> 48:45.557
is to hijack the bodies
of other lifeforms.

48:45.557 --> 48:48.226
