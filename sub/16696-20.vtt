YOUR NAME
ON THE SIDE OF IT?

19:11.901 --> 19:13.133
YEAH.

19:13.200 --> 19:14.734
AND YOU DID IT.
YOU ACTUALLY
DID IT, MAN.

19:14.801 --> 19:15.968
I KNOW.

19:16.033 --> 19:17.767
AND THAT SAME GUY
IS NOW MARRIED

19:17.834 --> 19:19.434
WITH A WONDERFUL WIFE
AND THREE GREAT KIDS.

19:19.501 --> 19:20.968
IT JUST BLOWS MY MIND.

19:21.033 --> 19:23.300
ME? COME ON,
OUR JUNIOR YEAR
OF HIGH SCHOOL,

19:23.367 --> 19:25.434
YOU BROKE THE RECORD
FOR DETENTIONS,

19:25.501 --> 19:28.834
AND NOW YOU'RE
CARRYING A BADGE
AND GIVING OUT TICKETS.

19:28.901 --> 19:31.534
AT LEAST I'M STILL
GETTING SUSPENDED.

19:33.267 --> 19:35.367
THEY'RE NOT GONNA
FIRE YOU, ARE THEY?

19:35.434 --> 19:37.868
NAH, MY CAPTAIN
INTERVENED.

19:37.934 --> 19:39.501
THEY'LL PROBABLY
JUST SEND ME AROUND

19:39.567 --> 19:41.501
TO HIGH SCHOOLS
WITH A PUPPET.

19:47.434 --> 19:50.634
HEY, LOOK WHAT I FOUND
IN THE GARAGE.

19:50.701 --> 19:51.834
NEAT.

19:51.901 --> 19:53.334
YOU STILL PLAY,
DON'T YOU?

19:53.400 --> 19:54.534
IS THERE AN ENTIRE
FAMILY OF ALIENS

19:54.601 --> 19:55.734
BEING CROSSBRED
WITH HUMANS

19:55.801 --> 19:57.734
AT WRIGHT-PATTERSON
AIR FORCE BASE?

19:57.801 --> 19:59.300
WITH A LITTLE HELP
FROM ELVIS?

19:59.367 --> 20:00.701
OH, YOU GOT IT.

20:00.767 --> 20:01.901
HEY, COME ON.
I KNOW THE GUYS.

20:01.968 --> 20:03.133
THAT'S MY DRUMMER TONY.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.601
REALLY?
YEAH.

20:04.667 --> 20:06.701
WHY DON'T WE JUMP UP THERE,
SING A SONG?

20:06.767 --> 20:07.968
WOULD THEY LET US?

20:08.033 --> 20:09.167
YEAH, THEY'D LET US.
COME ON, FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

20:09.234 --> 20:10.400
YOU KNOW WHAT I LOVE
ABOUT THE BLUES?

20:10.467 --> 20:12.367
IN THAT WORLD,
WE'RE STILL
YOUNG BUCKS.

20:12.434 --> 20:15.234
COME ON, BUCK. LET'S GO.
LET'S SEE WHAT WE CAN DO.

20:15.300 --> 20:16.534
HEY, TONY.
CAN WE JUMP IN?

20:16.601 --> 20:17.901
YEAH, COME ON.
COME ON.

20:17.968 --> 20:19.601
YOU GUYS KNOW
"CADILLAC MAN"?

20:19.667 --> 20:20.701
YEAH, YOU REMEMBER
THE WORDS?

20:20.767 --> 20:23.033
I KNOW THE WORDS.
YOU TRY TO KEEP UP WITH ME.

20:23.100 --> 20:24.234
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

20:24.300 --> 20:26.000
1, 2, 3, 4.

20:32.267 --> 20:34.033
* I PULL A 40-HOUR WEEK *

20:34.100 --> 20:36.534
* FRIDAY GOT THE CHECK
IN MY HAND *

20:38.801 --> 20:43.033
* WELL, I CASH IT REAL QUICK,
SPEND IT AS FAST AS I CAN *

20:45.267 --> 20:49.968
* I ROLL IN WITH THE LADIES,
THEY CALL ME THE CADILLAC MAN *

20:51.868 --> 20:56.367
* I'M THE KING OF THE ROAD,
COUPE DE VILLE IS MY THRONE *

20:59.033 --> 21:00.400
* AND AS LONG AS
I GOT THE DOUGH *

21:00.467 --> 21:02.400
* I'LL BE GOING, GOING *

21:02.467 --> 21:05.901
* GOING, GOING, GONE, YEAH *

21:05.968 --> 21:07.234
ALL RIGHT, HERE WE GO.

21:08.305 --> 21:14.757
