01:33.280 --> 01:34.414
Check.

01:35.715 --> 01:37.317
Checkmate.

01:52.599 --> 01:54.734
Your father
wants to see you.

02:26.632 --> 02:28.099
Come.

02:38.611 --> 02:40.046
Lisbeth made it for me.

02:43.882 --> 02:46.516
You're such big girls now.

02:58.896 --> 03:01.934
Come, Camilla.
I want to play a game with you.

03:25.156 --> 03:26.659
Camilla!

03:27.860 --> 03:30.127
Come to your father.

03:30.129 --> 03:31.629
Both of you.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.537
Come.

05:35.885 --> 05:38.585
Sorry about
the things I said.

05:38.587 --> 05:40.122
It's all right.

05:47.797 --> 05:50.798
You know I've been
under a lot of pressure,

05:50.800 --> 05:53.233
with the trial and work.

05:53.235 --> 05:54.904
Yes, I know.

05:57.006 --> 05:58.641
Just forgive me.

06:03.179 --> 06:05.311
I get a little insecure
sometimes

06:05.313 --> 06:07.247
when you talk to me
like that.

06:16.558 --> 06:18.260
Come here, have a drink.

06:21.896 --> 06:23.729
You know how much I love you,
do you?

06:49.290 --> 06:50.390
Who the fuck are you?

07:05.372 --> 07:08.241
I'm a fan of yours.

07:08.243 --> 07:10.345
I watch you on the news.

07:11.511 --> 07:12.844
Peter Ahlgren:

07:12.846 --> 07:15.947
The CEO who beat up
two prostitutes

07:15.949 --> 07:18.185
but got acquitted
in court yesterday.

07:20.654 --> 07:21.822
Put me down!

07:25.026 --> 07:26.959
Hey, what are you doing?

07:26.961 --> 07:28.693
I'm accessing
your bank accounts.

07:28.695 --> 07:30.229
Call security!

07:30.231 --> 07:32.931
I'm transferring 20%
of your cash

07:32.933 --> 07:34.499
to these two girls.

07:34.501 --> 07:37.736
The rest, I'm transferring
to your wife.

07:37.738 --> 07:39.738
<i>Good evening. Security.</i>

07:39.740 --> 07:41.339
Account number.

07:41.341 --> 07:43.074
Don't.

07:43.076 --> 07:45.010
<i>Mrs. Ahlgren,
is everything okay?</i>

07:47.681 --> 07:50.749
51912.

07:50.751 --> 07:54.052
Take your child and leave.
He won't hurt you again.

07:57.423 --> 07:59.590
I can undo all this tomorrow.

07:59.592 --> 08:03.395
Mr. Chen has bankrolled
your company for years.

08:03.397 --> 08:04.997
Isn't this his wife?

08:07.700 --> 08:09.602
<i>Oh, my God,
you like that.</i>

08:17.677 --> 08:19.710
If you try to contact
your wife again,

08:19.712 --> 08:21.612
this video
will be sent to him.

08:21.614 --> 08:24.014
If anything unexpected
should happen to her,

08:24.016 --> 08:27.084
this video
will be sent to him.

08:27.086 --> 08:28.886
You fucking bitch!

08:36.063 --> 08:37.697
Who are you?!

08:39.433 --> 08:41.833
You should ask yourself
that question.

08:55.081 --> 08:57.647
<i>A string of vigilante
attacks has rocked Stockholm.</i>

08:57.649 --> 09:00.184
<i>I don't know her name.
I've never seen her before.</i>

09:00.186 --> 09:02.653
<i>The attacker's M.O.
matches that of Lisbeth Salander,</i>

09:02.655 --> 09:04.755
<i>a local hacker with a history
of aggravated assault.</i>

09:04.757 --> 09:07.391
<i>If my daughter and
I had a message for her...</i>

09:07.393 --> 09:10.930
<i>I just want to say,
whoever you are, thank you.</i>

10:29.373 --> 10:31.506
This is a new
era for <i>Millennium.</i>

10:31.508 --> 10:33.842
I want you all to realize
that the only thing

10:33.844 --> 10:36.878
- holding this magazine back is your mind.
- Shit.

10:36.880 --> 10:39.848
And people refuse to believe
that it's in your mind.

10:39.850 --> 10:42.684
And you can feel it
when you go into a room,

10:42.686 --> 10:45.956
and there are people there
who don't have this knowledge.

10:47.391 --> 10:48.857
Don't be a child.

10:48.859 --> 10:51.226
'Cause I don't wanna bend
the knee, kiss the ring?

10:51.228 --> 10:53.395
Is that too much for "the great
Mikael Blomkvist"?

10:53.397 --> 10:55.063
For what's left of him, yeah.

10:55.065 --> 10:56.797
Levin is head
of publications now,

10:56.799 --> 10:58.232
and he deserves
your respect.

10:58.234 --> 11:00.602
He bought my magazine,
not my respect.

11:00.604 --> 11:02.704
Plus, he's wearing a cap.

11:02.706 --> 11:04.639
And...

11:04.641 --> 11:06.975
he has over two million
followers online.

11:06.977 --> 11:08.212
How many do you have?

11:09.745 --> 11:11.315
What do you want from me?

11:12.382 --> 11:14.284
I want you to write again.

11:22.692 --> 11:23.794
Come by tonight.

11:26.662 --> 11:29.697
I'm having dinner
with my husband tonight.

11:29.699 --> 11:30.898
Erika.

11:30.900 --> 11:32.766
It's for you.

11:32.768 --> 11:34.869
She'll be
right with you.

11:52.922 --> 11:56.292
Lisbeth Salander has a pet.

12:00.762 --> 12:02.196
It's a lizard.

12:02.198 --> 12:05.201
I don't know if I'm happy
for you or sad for him.

12:13.342 --> 12:15.710
Are you throwing
all of this out?

12:18.014 --> 12:20.216
Yeah. It's trash.

12:22.117 --> 12:24.119
You have a sister.

12:28.523 --> 12:29.691
No.

12:33.461 --> 12:35.830
She killed herself
three years ago.

12:38.301 --> 12:41.335
I can't believe
you didn't tell me.

12:41.337 --> 12:44.170
That I had a sister
or that she killed herself?

12:44.172 --> 12:45.505
Both.

12:45.507 --> 12:49.244
When our loved ones die,
we tell our friends.

12:52.013 --> 12:54.647
There's an incorrect assumption
in that statement.

12:57.184 --> 12:59.251
Yo.

12:59.254 --> 13:02.355
<i>There is a client
asking for the impossible.</i>

13:02.357 --> 13:04.224
<i>Interested?</i>

13:04.226 --> 13:05.527
Text me.

13:11.366 --> 13:13.832
She worked for my father
for years.

13:16.170 --> 13:17.438
He was a psychopath.

13:19.641 --> 13:21.540
Turns out...

13:21.542 --> 13:23.278
she was the same.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.782
I'm glad they're both dead.

13:36.490 --> 13:38.857
You have to go now.
I need to work.

13:38.859 --> 13:42.160
If you have another girl coming,
you can tell me.

13:42.162 --> 13:43.497
I have to work.

14:29.710 --> 14:32.777
They say time is the fire
in which we burn.

14:32.779 --> 14:34.147
I'm running out of it.

14:37.217 --> 14:38.485
Yeah.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.219
So do you think
it can be done?

14:42.221 --> 14:44.656
It depends.
What am I looking for?

14:44.658 --> 14:46.590
The sum of all my sins.

14:46.592 --> 14:49.660
A 2725 byte piece of software.

14:49.662 --> 14:52.430
It's a single-incident file.
It can't be reproduced,

14:52.432 --> 14:54.500
copied, only moved.

14:56.001 --> 14:58.368
And you want me
to steal it for you.

14:58.370 --> 15:01.240
They told me I'd have control
over it. But they lied.

15:03.509 --> 15:04.875
I realized too late

15:04.877 --> 15:07.778
that I had created
an abomination.

15:07.780 --> 15:09.981
Please, help me.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.294
Drop-off?

15:23.296 --> 15:25.296
Tomorrow morning, 7:00 sharp.

15:25.298 --> 15:27.498
Meet me on the Centralbron,
south shore.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.667
<i>I'll be next to
the train station.</i>

15:29.669 --> 15:31.602
<i>I've provided two levels
of clearance.</i>

15:31.604 --> 15:33.238
<i>After that,
you're on your own.</i>

16:04.902 --> 16:07.704
<i>Take
military systems, for example.</i>

16:07.706 --> 16:10.439
<i>Since 9/11,
all global defense systems</i>

16:10.441 --> 16:12.575
<i>are controlled
by satellite networks,</i>

16:12.577 --> 16:14.944
<i>and such networks
are all protected</i>

16:14.946 --> 16:17.680
<i>by the same
quantum encryption protocol.</i>

16:17.682 --> 16:19.915
<i>A tool of the kind
we're discussing here</i>

16:19.917 --> 16:23.018
<i>could effortlessly access the
tactical and nuclear arsenals</i>

16:23.020 --> 16:25.555
<i>of most major world powers.</i>

16:25.557 --> 16:27.556
<i>Via his personal computer,</i>

16:27.558 --> 16:31.827
<i>a single user would be
imbued with God-like power.</i>

16:45.209 --> 16:46.942
What you're
looking at here is

16:46.944 --> 16:48.710
what the Russians
are claiming to be

16:48.712 --> 16:50.579
some kind of system
security breach.

16:50.581 --> 16:53.816
This is
a Russian Topol-M SS-27 missile.

16:53.818 --> 16:57.051
Cold-launched,
three-stage, solid-propellant.

16:57.053 --> 17:00.322
It was wrongly moved
into launch position a week ago.

17:00.324 --> 17:02.991
As Special Division heads,
we urge you to come forward

17:02.993 --> 17:05.060
if this security breach
is a result

17:05.061 --> 17:07.663
of any classified project
you may be working on.

17:07.665 --> 17:09.464
Now, obviously,
we respect the fact

17:09.467 --> 17:12.434
you don't want to jeopardize
the security of your projects.

17:12.435 --> 17:13.935
The State Department

17:13.938 --> 17:15.570
has requested we cooperate
any way we can...

17:15.573 --> 17:18.573
Oh, shit.

17:18.575 --> 17:21.476
Agent Needham?
Anything to share?

17:21.478 --> 17:23.212
Personal
emergency.

17:23.214 --> 17:25.914
Special Division doesn't mean
you're actually special.

17:25.915 --> 17:27.715
I think it does.

17:37.928 --> 17:39.928
Shit.

18:30.980 --> 18:31.914
Sorry.

19:14.388 --> 19:15.991
Come on, come on, come on.

19:18.559 --> 19:21.594
Boom.

19:21.596 --> 19:24.099
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

20:03.404 --> 20:04.872
<i>Program encrypted.</i>

20:11.746 --> 20:14.815

<i>To run Firefall,

22:07.258 --> 22:08.761
Help me!

22:33.551 --> 22:34.585
Aah!

24:26.229 --> 24:28.996
It's me, Balder.

24:28.998 --> 24:31.433
I think I made
a terrible mistake.

26:13.034 --> 26:14.702
Hey!

27:51.831 --> 27:54.731
You did the right
thing by calling me.

27:54.733 --> 27:58.971
I have a data-track
on my program.

28:00.239 --> 28:01.573
So I know she got to it.

28:01.575 --> 28:03.309
And she won't
give it back to you.

28:04.743 --> 28:06.510
Last week...

28:06.512 --> 28:10.914
she assaulted one of Stockholm's
most respected businessmen.

28:10.916 --> 28:13.050
Emptied his bank accounts.

28:13.052 --> 28:16.355
Just one of many men
she's targeted.

28:19.792 --> 28:21.925
I don't know why...

28:21.927 --> 28:24.627
but I thought
I could trust her.

28:24.629 --> 28:26.829
I promise you.

28:26.831 --> 28:30.001
I'll do everything in my power
to protect you.

29:14.579 --> 29:16.078
Lisbeth.

29:16.080 --> 29:17.382
Hey.

29:19.184 --> 29:20.385
You okay?

29:22.820 --> 29:24.523
I fucked up.

29:25.857 --> 29:27.690
I need your help.

29:33.864 --> 29:37.067
That's the first test
of Project Firefall.

29:38.336 --> 29:40.670
It's a tool designed...

29:40.672 --> 29:44.107
to breach and control
most online defense systems.

29:45.842 --> 29:49.778
Frans Balder developed it
for the Americans...

29:49.780 --> 29:52.281
and he hired me
to take it back from them.

29:52.283 --> 29:54.350
"Take" as in steal?

29:54.352 --> 29:57.185
I think he wanted
to destroy it.

29:59.524 --> 30:01.122
Who's that?

30:01.124 --> 30:03.158
<i>He's the man
who stole it from me</i>

30:03.160 --> 30:05.026
<i>before I could
give it back to Balder.</i>

30:05.028 --> 30:07.662
And if you find him...

30:07.664 --> 30:08.831
what are you gonna do?

30:11.134 --> 30:14.903
I'm gonna take back
what he stole from me.

30:14.905 --> 30:17.839
So you want me
to help you find a ghost?

30:17.841 --> 30:19.241
You're good at that.

30:21.411 --> 30:25.213
I couldn't even find you
for three years.

30:25.215 --> 30:28.015
You just vanished.

30:28.017 --> 30:29.286
And I...

30:41.231 --> 30:43.764
<i>Flight
825 from Washington Dulles</i>

30:43.766 --> 30:45.300
<i>arriving at Gate 47.</i>

30:53.175 --> 30:57.278
Mr. Needham. I'm afraid
you have to come with us.

30:57.280 --> 31:00.215
<i>NSA Special
Division Edwin Needham.</i>

31:00.217 --> 31:02.284
Former U.S. military.

31:02.286 --> 31:06.322
Field ops: Afghanistan,
Mexico, Ukraine.

31:08.224 --> 31:09.992
"Special Division."

31:11.694 --> 31:14.194
Is that
an American euphemism for

31:14.196 --> 31:16.030
"no accountability
and no oversight"?

31:16.032 --> 31:17.466
I don't know. Um...

31:19.100 --> 31:22.070
I mean, I'm feeling
pretty overseen right now.

31:25.007 --> 31:27.875
Look. I'm aware
that someone stole

31:27.877 --> 31:29.943
something
of high value to you.

31:29.945 --> 31:31.811
And I presume you're here
in Stockholm

31:31.813 --> 31:33.316
to find that someone?

31:36.285 --> 31:40.587
But I'm here to tell you
that that's my job, not yours.

31:40.589 --> 31:43.757
The NSA has no business
on Swedish soil.

31:43.759 --> 31:47.995
Funny part about that is
I'm not here on business.

31:47.997 --> 31:49.663
Pleasure.

31:49.665 --> 31:51.298
Is that so?

31:53.034 --> 31:55.935
Look,
am I being deported?

31:55.937 --> 31:58.273
No. No.

31:59.474 --> 32:03.009
For now,
you're just getting this.

32:03.011 --> 32:05.911
- A tourist guide?
- If you engage in any activities

32:05.913 --> 32:08.581
not listed in that book,
I'll have you arrested

32:08.583 --> 32:11.454
and put on the first plane
back to Washington.

32:13.088 --> 32:15.589
Now have a nice day.

32:15.591 --> 32:17.392
You, too.

32:41.982 --> 32:43.585
You have to take care of this.

32:45.185 --> 32:46.419
Okay.

32:46.421 --> 32:48.220
And I need to borrow
some gear.

32:48.222 --> 32:50.055
One day we'll talk about

32:50.057 --> 32:51.858
your interpretation
of that word.

32:51.860 --> 32:53.627
- "Gear"?
- "Borrow."

33:16.884 --> 33:19.453
- You need a hand?
- No.

33:31.465 --> 33:32.731
What about Balder?

33:32.733 --> 33:34.366
Checked out of his hotel.

33:34.368 --> 33:36.802
Cell phone disconnected.
But get this:

33:36.804 --> 33:38.202
Look who he went to.

33:38.204 --> 33:40.137
His last geotag showed him

33:40.139 --> 33:42.206
at SAPO Headquarters
this morning.

33:42.208 --> 33:44.575
I'm guessing he thinks
you stole this from him,

33:44.577 --> 33:46.814
since you missed
the drop-off.

33:49.249 --> 33:51.316
That means she moved him
to a safe house.

33:51.318 --> 33:52.751
Why?

33:52.753 --> 33:55.420
Balder's program had
a FREAK encryption.

33:55.422 --> 33:57.321
<i>He's the only one
who can open it.</i>

33:57.323 --> 34:00.326
That means these guys are going
after him next.

34:03.596 --> 34:05.398
I find Balder...

34:06.599 --> 34:08.299
...I find him.

35:11.162 --> 35:13.465
Hello, Lisbeth Salander.

35:20.505 --> 35:23.208
"Sofia Novak."

35:34.352 --> 35:36.253
The fuck happened here?

35:46.698 --> 35:48.199
Pow.

35:56.373 --> 35:57.907
You Vilma?

35:57.909 --> 36:01.543
200 crowns a night.
No pets. No drugs. No friends.

36:01.545 --> 36:03.147
I can show you
how the heating sy...

36:11.221 --> 36:13.890
<i>I got into the SAPO servers.</i>

36:13.892 --> 36:17.392
<i>They're keeping him
at 774 Birger Jarlsgatan.</i>

36:17.394 --> 36:19.895
<i>There are two plainclothes
officers in a car</i>

36:19.897 --> 36:22.766
<i>and several more uniformed
officers on the premises.</i>

36:23.734 --> 36:25.703
<i>Careful, Lisbeth.</i>

37:04.273 --> 37:06.942
August. Let's move away
from the window, please.

37:06.944 --> 37:10.311
August. August, hey. Hey.

37:10.313 --> 37:12.413
You said it would be
a couple of days

37:12.415 --> 37:14.882
and then I'll go
back home to Mom.

37:14.884 --> 37:16.584
"A couple" means two.

37:16.586 --> 37:18.119
No, I'll tell you what.

37:18.121 --> 37:19.620
When this is all over,

37:19.622 --> 37:22.556
I promise that I'll take you
back to San Francisco.

37:22.558 --> 37:24.325
And you'll stay with us.

37:24.327 --> 37:25.595
Yeah, of course.

37:28.564 --> 37:31.634
Why don't you go back
to your drawing, all right?

37:32.969 --> 37:34.604
All right?

37:59.461 --> 38:01.227
- Whiskey. Neat.
- Sure.

38:01.229 --> 38:03.463
I'll have the same.

38:03.465 --> 38:05.965
- Mikael Blomkvist.
- Deputy Grane.

38:05.967 --> 38:07.269
What a coincidence.

38:09.037 --> 38:11.841
This is the man you should
be after. Not Salander.

38:13.375 --> 38:17.677
Your friend Salander has
perpetrated a cyber attack

38:17.679 --> 38:21.614
on the most important security
agency in America.

38:21.616 --> 38:25.051
I don't really see how
this makes her any less guilty.

38:25.053 --> 38:27.721
She doesn't have
the monopoly on guilt.

38:27.723 --> 38:29.823
You should be looking
for this man, too.

38:29.825 --> 38:31.993
What makes you think I'm not?

38:42.337 --> 38:44.439
Now, if you will excuse me.

39:01.623 --> 39:05.624
Yeah?

39:05.626 --> 39:08.727
<i>It's Malin. I
got a hit on the spider tattoo.</i>

39:08.729 --> 39:10.130
Text it to me.

39:10.132 --> 39:11.599
<i>Sure, sending now.</i>

39:40.426 --> 39:42.096
You Milos?

39:44.165 --> 39:45.532
Do you know this man?

39:46.834 --> 39:49.303
He has a tattoo like yours.

40:06.486 --> 40:08.953
So are you a cop?

40:08.955 --> 40:10.354
No, worse.

40:10.356 --> 40:12.293
I'm a journalist.

40:16.396 --> 40:19.664
That guy, he's part
of this group.

40:19.666 --> 40:22.433
Heavy people.

40:22.435 --> 40:25.305
Pretty much the worst psychos
you can find in Stockholm.

40:27.607 --> 40:29.907
You used to work for them?

40:29.909 --> 40:32.076
What makes you think that?

40:32.078 --> 40:33.847
Your tattoo.

40:39.485 --> 40:41.986
This is a scar.

40:41.988 --> 40:44.724
- He cut it into me with a knife.
- Why?

40:47.359 --> 40:49.026
I used to do photo work.

40:49.028 --> 40:50.895
Tried to sell him
some good ones

40:50.897 --> 40:53.563
of a politician
they were blackmailing.

40:53.565 --> 40:56.566
I pushed the price too much.

40:56.568 --> 40:58.738
This is what I got
in return.

41:13.719 --> 41:15.719
You like it?

41:15.721 --> 41:17.356
I'm sorry.

41:24.529 --> 41:27.831
This is what you get when you
try to fuck with the Spiders.

41:27.833 --> 41:29.034
"The Spiders"?

41:31.003 --> 41:34.403
They call him the <i>"Otravitel."</i>
He's the worst of them.

41:34.405 --> 41:36.873
And if you wanna keep
that pretty face,

41:36.875 --> 41:38.944
I'd stop asking about him.

42:08.873 --> 42:10.609
No, thank you, no.

42:17.448 --> 42:19.715
Tell me not to worry.

42:19.717 --> 42:22.851
- What do you mean?
- I've seen this before.

42:22.853 --> 42:25.220
- Seen what?
- You obsessing over Lisbeth.

42:25.222 --> 42:26.791
This is not about Lisbeth.

42:29.592 --> 42:30.926
Mikael.

42:30.928 --> 42:32.527
There were two key stories

42:32.529 --> 42:35.065
that made your name
and built the magazine.

42:35.067 --> 42:37.800
The first you couldn't
have written without her,

42:37.802 --> 42:40.936
and the second was about her.

42:40.938 --> 42:42.304
I think you are scared

42:42.306 --> 42:44.206
what would become
of Mikael Blomkvist

42:44.208 --> 42:45.943
if there were no
Lisbeth Salander.

42:54.185 --> 42:56.117
I'm sorry.

42:56.119 --> 42:58.990
- Lisbeth.
- I haven't heard of The Spiders.

43:00.324 --> 43:02.523
They sound like
the last people on earth

43:02.525 --> 43:04.829
<i>you'd want
to have control of Firefall.</i>

43:06.863 --> 43:08.963
You alone?

43:08.965 --> 43:10.834
Do you want me to come over?

43:12.602 --> 43:15.805
<i>Lisbeth.
Tell me where you are.</i>

43:21.011 --> 43:22.313
No.

43:23.780 --> 43:26.317
I wouldn't want to ruin
your evening.

44:00.150 --> 44:02.419
Hey, who's this?

44:04.820 --> 44:05.954
The blonde there.

44:25.507 --> 44:27.074
Who the fuck are you?

44:27.076 --> 44:29.342
Ned the Bathroom Stalker.

44:29.344 --> 44:32.379
Listen, I need to get into
contact with somebody you know.

44:32.381 --> 44:34.217
You know
who I'm talkin' about.

44:35.518 --> 44:37.418
What did she give you?

44:37.420 --> 44:39.052
A phone?
Some kind of contact?

44:39.054 --> 44:41.321
Yeah, she did.

44:41.323 --> 44:43.225
Okay, good.

44:46.261 --> 44:48.261
Now, listen,
I know you think

44:48.263 --> 44:50.596
you're the only girl
she fucking in here.

44:50.598 --> 44:52.598
But I got about three
or four other girls

44:52.600 --> 44:55.435
I could be talkin' to.
And that's just in this place.

44:55.437 --> 44:58.205
All right? So while
I respect the loyalty,

44:58.207 --> 45:01.276
I gotta say it's a little bit
undeserved.

45:03.744 --> 45:05.445
Bitch.

45:05.447 --> 45:07.282
"Bitch" is right.

45:10.252 --> 45:11.650
She gave it to me.

45:11.652 --> 45:14.220
It's the only way
I have to contact her.

45:14.222 --> 45:15.621
Hope you find her.

45:15.623 --> 45:17.957
Boom.

45:17.959 --> 45:19.760
I will.

46:58.425 --> 46:59.759
Sal...!

47:16.242 --> 47:17.810
You fucked me.

47:34.860 --> 47:36.862
Fucking bitch!

47:53.112 --> 47:55.214
- Good morning.
- Hey.

47:56.515 --> 47:59.915
- Did you find your Russian?
- Russian?

47:59.917 --> 48:03.119
Maybe you misspelled it,
but isn't <i>otravitel</i>

48:03.121 --> 48:05.221
Russian crime slang
for "poisoner"?

48:05.223 --> 48:06.759
It's Russian?

48:16.635 --> 48:18.002
What are you doing?

48:33.818 --> 48:35.619
Here you go.
They're from Holtser.

48:35.621 --> 48:38.821
Thank God.
Freezing my balls off.

48:38.823 --> 48:41.390
- Who is Mr. Holtser?
- Me.

49:10.120 --> 49:11.520
Lisbeth's father.

49:11.522 --> 49:14.157
He was part
of a Russian crime ring.

50:09.679 --> 50:12.249
I'll come with you,
but leave him out of it.

51:30.058 --> 51:31.226
No.

55:46.577 --> 55:48.113
Come on.

55:57.454 --> 55:58.956
That's a good boy.

56:00.924 --> 56:02.226
Safety first.

56:08.065 --> 56:09.431
Stop the car!

56:40.998 --> 56:43.898
August.
You have to come with me.

56:43.900 --> 56:45.800
Don't.

56:45.802 --> 56:47.170
August.

56:50.273 --> 56:52.239
Go.

56:52.241 --> 56:53.943
Get in the car.

58:08.016 --> 58:09.252
Aw, fuck!

01:01:17.335 --> 01:01:20.872
I want to go back
to my mother, please.

01:01:28.914 --> 01:01:31.715
"The horses stand
silent in the field."

01:01:36.887 --> 01:01:39.323
"The snow comes early
this year."

01:01:42.426 --> 01:01:44.996
You know the answer
to those questions.

01:01:46.565 --> 01:01:48.697
You know how to open
your father's program.

01:01:48.699 --> 01:01:52.069
I want to go back
to my mother, please.

01:02:15.126 --> 01:02:17.893
<i>Police believe that the killer
has abducted the victim's</i>

01:02:17.895 --> 01:02:21.863
<i>young son and is still at
large. The suspect has been</i>

01:02:21.865 --> 01:02:24.966
<i>identified as Lisbeth Salander,
a Stockholm resident with</i>

01:02:24.968 --> 01:02:27.101
<i>a criminal history
ranging from cybercrimes</i>

01:02:27.103 --> 01:02:30.006
<i>to aggravated assault.</i>

01:02:34.512 --> 01:02:37.712
<i>She is believed to be armed
and highly dangerous.</i>

01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.656
Mr. Needham.

01:03:21.424 --> 01:03:23.958
Was this area part of
a walking tour in your guide?

01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:25.860
You know,
I always thought a safe house

01:03:25.862 --> 01:03:27.964
was supposed to be,
I don't know... safe?

01:03:30.799 --> 01:03:33.601
You're done crashing
around my city like a wild boar.

01:03:33.603 --> 01:03:37.272
Arrest him.
Send him back to Disneyland.

01:03:58.160 --> 01:03:59.928
You play whites.

01:04:31.158 --> 01:04:33.195
Your father taught you?

01:04:34.997 --> 01:04:37.197
He's dead now.

01:04:37.199 --> 01:04:39.668
Maybe I shouldn't
think of him anymore.

01:04:41.703 --> 01:04:43.771
- Why not?
- Because that's the past.

01:04:45.206 --> 01:04:48.574
He once said the past,

01:04:48.576 --> 01:04:50.511
sometimes,
can be like a black hole.

01:04:52.146 --> 01:04:55.247
If you get too close...

01:04:55.249 --> 01:04:57.384
it might pull you in.

01:04:57.386 --> 01:04:59.586
And you disappear.

01:05:02.123 --> 01:05:04.660
I don't want to disappear.

01:05:07.561 --> 01:05:08.863
You won't.

01:05:20.073 --> 01:05:22.410
Who was that woman
on the bridge?

01:05:26.881 --> 01:05:28.482
The past.

01:05:36.289 --> 01:05:39.324
Hey! Hey!

01:05:39.326 --> 01:05:40.894
You don't want
to finish the game?

01:05:42.128 --> 01:05:43.530
Oh.

01:05:44.665 --> 01:05:45.700
Checkmate.

01:06:12.693 --> 01:06:14.492
It's okay.

01:06:14.494 --> 01:06:17.697
- He's a friend.
- Hi, August. I'm Micke.

01:06:19.366 --> 01:06:20.997
It's her.

01:06:20.999 --> 01:06:23.536
I know. We need to talk.

01:06:34.647 --> 01:06:36.280
That's for you to keep.

01:06:36.282 --> 01:06:38.752
Until the rematch.

01:06:41.554 --> 01:06:44.589
1,780,099.

01:06:44.591 --> 01:06:45.692
What's that?

01:06:47.426 --> 01:06:52.229
It's the answer to "The snow
comes early this year."

01:06:52.231 --> 01:06:55.998
It's a number problem.
Each letter is a number.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:57.835
So I figure out
the big number,

01:06:57.837 --> 01:07:00.371
then I break it down
into prime factors.

01:07:00.373 --> 01:07:04.076
Father said he made his program
based on how I think.

01:07:08.013 --> 01:07:09.648
You think I'm a freak.

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:12.917
No, I don't.

01:07:16.889 --> 01:07:18.590
Get some sleep.

01:07:21.393 --> 01:07:24.361
When I realized that
the man that killed Balder

01:07:24.363 --> 01:07:26.396
worked for your father,

01:07:26.398 --> 01:07:29.733
I tracked all of
his ex-associates.

01:07:29.735 --> 01:07:31.501
And every one of them
seems to

01:07:31.503 --> 01:07:33.537
link back to
Camilla Salander.

01:07:33.539 --> 01:07:35.839
She's been picking up
your father's network

01:07:35.841 --> 01:07:37.173
where he left off.

01:07:37.175 --> 01:07:39.575
But now she calls them
the Spiders.

01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.817
She worshiped that pig.

01:07:46.318 --> 01:07:48.420
And now she's become him.

01:07:51.390 --> 01:07:52.591
Lisbeth, you're bleeding.

01:07:56.895 --> 01:07:58.296
I know.

01:08:12.977 --> 01:08:14.378
Do it.

01:08:32.263 --> 01:08:33.996
It's done.

01:09:00.323 --> 01:09:03.426
I bet you can't wait
to write a story about all this.

01:09:07.397 --> 01:09:09.397
About me...

01:09:09.399 --> 01:09:12.032
...and my psycho family.

01:09:12.033 --> 01:09:13.770
Just like you did last time.

01:09:29.286 --> 01:09:30.518
Lisbeth.

01:09:30.520 --> 01:09:32.152
They need August
to run Firefall.

01:09:32.154 --> 01:09:33.988
Without him,
they have nothing.

01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:36.189
We have to get him
out of the country.

01:09:36.191 --> 01:09:37.493
Out of her reach.

01:09:39.029 --> 01:09:40.595
His mother lives
in San Francisco.

01:09:42.497 --> 01:09:44.698
But even if we did
get him on a plane,

01:09:44.701 --> 01:09:46.435
that won't guarantee
his safety.

01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:48.738
No.

01:09:52.609 --> 01:09:53.877
But I know someone who can.

01:10:35.451 --> 01:10:40.354
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Stockholm Arlanda Airport.</i>

01:11:42.916 --> 01:11:45.186
What the fu...?

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:16.750
Wanted suspect in
Terminal 3.

01:12:19.586 --> 01:12:21.019
Follow me.

01:12:21.021 --> 01:12:24.256
Female.
Wearing a bright pink hat.

01:12:44.577 --> 01:12:47.145
Back in the room.
Back in the room.

01:12:47.147 --> 01:12:49.381
Lady, be quiet. Just relax.

01:12:59.693 --> 01:13:01.558
Hey, you.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:03.262
Stay in your cell!

01:13:24.717 --> 01:13:29.353
Passenger Needham, please
proceed to Gate 45 immediately.

01:13:29.355 --> 01:13:33.225
<i>Passenger Needham, please
proceed to Gate 45 immediately.</i>

01:13:50.042 --> 01:13:51.574
Salander.

01:13:51.576 --> 01:13:54.246
North end of the terminal.
Personnel-only door.

01:13:56.048 --> 01:13:58.081
Tell me you got the boy.

01:13:58.083 --> 01:13:59.649
For now.

01:13:59.651 --> 01:14:01.517
I need you to get him back
to the U.S.

01:14:01.519 --> 01:14:02.985
and make sure that he's safe.

01:14:02.987 --> 01:14:04.020
<i>No, no, no.</i>

01:14:04.022 --> 01:14:05.957
Not without Firefall.

01:14:08.593 --> 01:14:10.861
I have eyes on the American.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:13.462
Without August,
there is no Firefall.

01:14:13.464 --> 01:14:15.700
You have to let it go.
It's what Balder wanted.

01:14:18.170 --> 01:14:19.969
You don't understand
what this is.

01:14:19.971 --> 01:14:22.271
I've spent years waiting for
Balder to deliver Firefall.

01:14:22.273 --> 01:14:24.640
- I won't give it up now.
- Think you have a choice?

01:14:24.642 --> 01:14:26.876
What I have is a responsibility
to my country.

01:14:26.878 --> 01:14:29.180
Something somebody like you
wouldn't understand.

01:14:31.950 --> 01:14:33.749
I understand
how to open that door.

01:14:33.751 --> 01:14:35.453
Shit.

01:14:38.356 --> 01:14:40.089
- Freeze!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:14:40.091 --> 01:14:42.894
Agree to take the kid back
to the U.S. or it stays locked.

01:14:45.997 --> 01:14:47.529
<i>Or you could just jump.</i>

01:14:47.531 --> 01:14:49.499
- Fuck.
- <i>Up to you.</i>

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:57.506
You! Stop!

01:14:57.508 --> 01:14:59.642
<i>I'll get the kid out.</i>

01:14:59.644 --> 01:15:01.511
I have your word?

01:15:02.579 --> 01:15:03.678
You have my word.

01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.514
I said, on the floor! Now!

01:15:18.862 --> 01:15:20.930
Get in the van.

01:16:17.887 --> 01:16:19.455
Dad?

01:16:20.890 --> 01:16:22.489
<i>Hello?</i>

01:16:22.491 --> 01:16:23.525
<i>Hello?</i>

01:17:23.551 --> 01:17:25.887
Why do you make yourself
so ugly, Libby?

01:17:28.723 --> 01:17:31.726
I've imagined this moment
for so long.

01:17:33.028 --> 01:17:36.029
I had a whole speech
prepared.

01:17:36.031 --> 01:17:37.662
And now I'm nervous.

01:17:37.664 --> 01:17:40.133
I should've
written it down.

01:17:56.384 --> 01:17:57.519
The boy is secure.

01:18:02.322 --> 01:18:04.156
Listen, a client
is willing to pay us

01:18:04.158 --> 01:18:05.590
a lot of money
for this thing.

01:18:05.592 --> 01:18:06.894
I don't care.
Just shoot me.

01:18:09.630 --> 01:18:10.831
"Shoot you"?

01:18:11.966 --> 01:18:14.900
You're my sister.

01:18:14.902 --> 01:18:17.171
Besides,
I have so much to tell you.

01:18:22.643 --> 01:18:24.610
Mikael.

01:18:33.654 --> 01:18:37.255
Someone always has
to carry the pain, Libby.

01:18:37.257 --> 01:18:39.093
Well, now it's your turn.

01:18:43.663 --> 01:18:45.399
Bring her.
Kill the journalist.

01:18:52.271 --> 01:18:53.372
Move.

01:18:54.774 --> 01:18:56.710
Go!

01:19:31.577 --> 01:19:33.112
No!

01:20:20.425 --> 01:20:23.026
Hey, man,
you got some creamer?

01:20:23.028 --> 01:20:25.030
No, I do not.

01:20:31.970 --> 01:20:33.004
'Kay.

01:20:37.275 --> 01:20:39.377
Please don't touch that.
It's vintage.

01:20:40.545 --> 01:20:42.612
Yeah.

01:20:42.614 --> 01:20:44.780
Uh, when was it, '02?

01:20:44.782 --> 01:20:46.884
Took down Big Pharma
with this bad boy.

01:20:48.453 --> 01:20:51.021
The King Pharma crash was done
from a 7792.

01:20:53.290 --> 01:20:55.525
Actually, I
did it from a 7770.

01:20:55.527 --> 01:20:58.228
But who's counting?

01:20:58.230 --> 01:20:59.898
You're Warchild?

01:21:00.966 --> 01:21:02.500
<i>The</i> Warchild?

01:21:03.834 --> 01:21:07.337
Yeah, I was
for a little while.

01:21:07.339 --> 01:21:11.610
NSA pays way better.
Way motherfuckin' better.

01:21:14.378 --> 01:21:16.912
- Creamer?
- My boy.

01:21:25.022 --> 01:21:26.924
Heard that went well.

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:37.366
Is that August's location?

01:21:57.787 --> 01:21:59.623
Where's she takin' him?

01:22:02.959 --> 01:22:04.360
Home.

01:22:34.924 --> 01:22:36.593
Hello, August.

01:22:52.908 --> 01:22:56.277
You know, a little
birdie told me

01:22:56.279 --> 01:22:58.881
you know how to open
your daddy's work.

01:23:01.617 --> 01:23:04.320
I need you to do that
for me now.

01:23:13.195 --> 01:23:15.128
Hello?

01:23:15.130 --> 01:23:16.565
Anyone in there?

01:23:22.405 --> 01:23:24.538
You will help me.

01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:25.905
Soon.

01:23:25.907 --> 01:23:27.442
You'll see.

01:23:30.078 --> 01:23:31.848
Such a big boy.

01:23:54.001 --> 01:23:55.735
We need to share this
with Tactical.

01:23:55.737 --> 01:23:58.405
Put together a team. Fast.

01:23:58.407 --> 01:23:59.974
Get inside.

01:26:33.225 --> 01:26:34.493
Okay.

01:27:11.562 --> 01:27:12.597
<i>Camilla!</i>

01:27:24.375 --> 01:27:25.944
How did they know?

01:27:28.747 --> 01:27:31.814
How did the Spiders know
Balder's location?

01:27:31.816 --> 01:27:34.316
Your guess
is as good as mine.

01:27:44.495 --> 01:27:45.663
You're the client.

01:27:47.131 --> 01:27:49.101
You're buying Firefall
from her.

01:27:52.837 --> 01:27:58.007
Access by a single user
to online nuclear weapons...

01:27:58.009 --> 01:28:01.010
Would you rather have that
in the hands of the Americans,

01:28:01.012 --> 01:28:03.611
the nation that
never missed a war,

01:28:03.613 --> 01:28:06.914
or us, the nation
who never went to war?

01:28:06.916 --> 01:28:10.221
Now August and Lisbeth are
paying the price for all this.

01:28:11.489 --> 01:28:13.856
They'll hurt him.

01:28:13.858 --> 01:28:15.356
People have taken
the fall for

01:28:15.358 --> 01:28:18.029
far lesser causes,
Mr. Blomkvist.

01:28:40.017 --> 01:28:41.349
Do you see him?

01:28:41.351 --> 01:28:43.486
Tracker puts August
in the west wing.

01:28:55.799 --> 01:28:57.099
<i>Status?</i>

01:28:57.101 --> 01:28:59.202
24%.

01:29:57.458 --> 01:29:59.128
Get out of there!

01:30:12.074 --> 01:30:13.175
Lisbeth!

01:30:35.964 --> 01:30:36.999
Give up.

01:31:27.181 --> 01:31:29.148
Breathe, Lisbeth.

01:32:03.049 --> 01:32:05.916
Would you like
a glass of water?

01:32:05.918 --> 01:32:07.420
Please get her
a glass of water.

01:32:17.496 --> 01:32:20.133
He needs to open
the program for us.

01:32:21.767 --> 01:32:24.269
Would you please talk
some sense into him?

01:32:24.271 --> 01:32:26.105
Fuck you.

01:32:30.944 --> 01:32:33.577
I made these
just for him.

01:32:33.579 --> 01:32:35.447
I will start with this one,
the red one.

01:32:36.782 --> 01:32:38.082
It will not kill him,

01:32:38.084 --> 01:32:39.750
but it will blind him
permanently.

01:32:39.752 --> 01:32:42.052
The black one, though...

01:32:42.054 --> 01:32:43.887
he won't survive.

01:32:55.368 --> 01:32:56.969
August.

01:32:59.038 --> 01:33:00.739
You have to tell them.

01:33:08.513 --> 01:33:10.846
You have to trust me.

01:33:15.586 --> 01:33:18.120
<i>To run
Firefall, enter value for:</i>

01:33:18.122 --> 01:33:21.692
<i>"The trees fade in the mist."</i>

01:33:21.694 --> 01:33:24.460
13, 23, 31.

01:33:24.462 --> 01:33:27.397
115,751.

01:33:27.399 --> 01:33:32.034
1,943,629.

01:33:32.036 --> 01:33:33.938
"The trees fade in the mist."

01:33:40.411 --> 01:33:42.980
<i>Access granted.</i>

01:33:42.982 --> 01:33:44.680
<i>Firefall online.</i>

01:33:44.682 --> 01:33:45.817
It's done.

01:33:48.253 --> 01:33:50.054
I won't let them keep it.

01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:03.567
Is that really necessary?

01:34:13.543 --> 01:34:15.878
I'll transfer the funds
immediately.

01:34:15.880 --> 01:34:18.513
You don't have to.

01:34:18.515 --> 01:34:20.084
Why is that?

01:34:24.955 --> 01:34:27.022
It's okay. It's okay.

01:34:34.232 --> 01:34:35.199
You can't...

01:34:41.038 --> 01:34:43.408
Thanks for
all your help.

01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:47.044
But I think
we'll keep it.

01:35:42.331 --> 01:35:44.134
Calm down.

01:35:47.069 --> 01:35:48.904
You'll suffocate.

01:35:50.307 --> 01:35:52.108
Trust me, I know.

01:35:53.275 --> 01:35:55.111
You know where we are?

01:35:57.712 --> 01:35:59.647
This used to be
Father's bedroom.

01:36:02.184 --> 01:36:04.451
Until it became mine, too.

01:36:04.453 --> 01:36:06.755
But you know that.

01:36:15.064 --> 01:36:17.699
There is something
that you didn't know.

01:36:21.504 --> 01:36:23.171
When he died...

01:36:25.740 --> 01:36:27.809
an odd thing happened.

01:36:31.447 --> 01:36:33.715
It was like an awakening.

01:36:36.651 --> 01:36:39.888
I could finally see
our father's true face:

01:36:41.624 --> 01:36:43.358
A monster's face.

01:36:47.362 --> 01:36:49.330
And I was nothing.

01:37:00.241 --> 01:37:02.008
Do you remember
that morning

01:37:02.010 --> 01:37:04.712
that you jumped off the balcony
and left me behind?

01:37:07.182 --> 01:37:09.950
The things he did to me
that day.

01:37:11.519 --> 01:37:13.388
And the day after.

01:37:17.691 --> 01:37:19.827
And the day after that.

01:37:22.764 --> 01:37:24.831
For 16 years.

01:37:27.468 --> 01:37:29.404
And for that, Libby,
I blame you.

01:37:33.608 --> 01:37:36.043
And so now
the world will burn.

01:37:37.811 --> 01:37:40.814
And everyone will know
it was you who lit the match.

01:37:47.120 --> 01:37:48.889
Goodbye, Libby.

01:38:12.714 --> 01:38:14.047
Okay.

01:38:26.092 --> 01:38:27.260
Uh... there.

01:38:47.546 --> 01:38:48.481
There.

01:39:10.603 --> 01:39:12.303
Targets down.
Give me more.

01:39:12.305 --> 01:39:13.606
<i>I got you, Warchild.</i>

01:39:25.117 --> 01:39:26.185
I need
to get you out...

01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:34.159
I have her.
She's on the move.

01:39:57.649 --> 01:39:58.849
Where's the kid?

01:40:35.720 --> 01:40:37.018
Come on.

01:40:37.020 --> 01:40:38.723
Get up, Lisbeth.

01:40:40.825 --> 01:40:41.890
Yes!

01:40:41.892 --> 01:40:43.060
Move!

01:40:45.896 --> 01:40:47.429
Come on. There.

01:41:04.548 --> 01:41:06.047
Come on.

01:41:29.873 --> 01:41:31.642
<i>House is clear.
Where is she?</i>

01:41:34.010 --> 01:41:36.814
<i>She's on the other side
of the house. She's leaving.</i>

01:41:43.454 --> 01:41:44.388
Go.

01:41:47.290 --> 01:41:49.423
<i>You should have
visual on the car.</i>

01:41:49.425 --> 01:41:50.928
I see her!

01:41:53.963 --> 01:41:54.964
Got her.

01:41:59.635 --> 01:42:01.069
Shit.

01:42:11.747 --> 01:42:12.980
Shit!

01:42:15.117 --> 01:42:16.352
On the move.

01:42:20.823 --> 01:42:23.657
<i>She's on the main
road going around the lake.</i>

01:42:23.659 --> 01:42:26.061
<i>Cut through the woods
to intercept.</i>

01:42:51.486 --> 01:42:53.051
Well done.

01:42:53.053 --> 01:42:54.423
Yes, ma'am.

01:44:23.611 --> 01:44:26.245
You can't blame me
for leaving that day.

01:44:27.480 --> 01:44:29.246
"That day"?

01:44:32.152 --> 01:44:34.355
This is not about a day.

01:44:36.957 --> 01:44:38.826
It's about a lifetime.

01:44:41.895 --> 01:44:44.297
