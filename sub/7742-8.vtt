WEBVTT

00:01.794 --> 00:03.378
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:09.009 --> 00:13.429
Look, I've been in the States
for just over two weeks with someone else.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.723
I didn't want to have to
tell Ellie that I'd been here

00:15.808 --> 00:17.642
and not called her right away.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.395
I get it. I really do get it.

00:20.562 --> 00:23.981
Take your hands off me.

00:24.191 --> 00:27.360
I wish that I could.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.196
What is hospital policy
regarding lost or found drugs?

00:30.280 --> 00:31.989
Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it.

00:32.074 --> 00:33.491
Why so desperate?

00:33.575 --> 00:35.618
Do you want to get your ass kicked?

00:38.747 --> 00:40.707
You know this is pretend, right?

00:40.791 --> 00:42.625
How long do I get to keep it on?

00:42.751 --> 00:44.585
Don't run so fast.

00:46.588 --> 00:48.256
-Daddy!
-Mom!

00:49.258 --> 00:50.842
"Real blood."

00:53.929 --> 00:56.556
One of my nurses
needs a pediatric psych referral.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.016
-Which one?
-She'd rather not say.

00:59.101 --> 01:01.728
I don't make her anxious. I'm here.

01:02.146 --> 01:03.896
Of course you're here.
Where the hell else you gonna be?

01:03.981 --> 01:05.565
You're a fucking bartender!

01:05.733 --> 01:07.442
I just... I need to take a breath.

01:07.526 --> 01:09.485
Well, listen, take a couple.

01:09.570 --> 01:13.114
Just don't think I'm, you know,
sitting at home waiting by the phone.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.241
Yeah, where are you now?

01:16.827 --> 01:17.952
Home.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.275
Fiona, sweetheart,

02:31.360 --> 02:32.985
I just want you to know
you're not in any trouble

02:33.070 --> 02:34.362
and you haven't done anything wrong.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.615
-I know.
-And you're in a safe place.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.368
And you can tell me anything
and you'll still be in a safe place.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.954
-Do you understand?
-Like what?

02:43.038 --> 02:45.998
Well, what about your cast?

02:46.083 --> 02:47.959
It's my show and tell.

02:48.335 --> 02:52.380
It's got blood on it, "real blood."
It says so right there.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.382
Hey, you want to tell me about that?

02:54.842 --> 02:57.426
That's from my lip. I got stitches.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.303
See? Look.

03:00.222 --> 03:02.723
Whoa. Those are good stitches.

03:03.600 --> 03:05.893
Hey, what did they say
at the doctor's office?

03:05.978 --> 03:07.562
Did anybody talk to your mom and dad?

03:07.646 --> 03:10.982
We didn't go to the doctor's office.
We sewed it up in our kitchen.

03:12.234 --> 03:15.236
In your kitchen? Okay.

03:16.738 --> 03:21.242
Hey, Fiona, honey, who knows you got
hurt besides your mom and dad?

03:23.996 --> 03:25.496
Of course not!

03:26.248 --> 03:29.375
The arm's not broken! You know that, right?

03:29.459 --> 03:32.253
I mean, jeez, it's just a cast, okay?

03:32.921 --> 03:36.382
She wanted it for show and tell.
Her mother is a nurse.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.218
Yes.

03:39.303 --> 03:42.013
All right, yeah, of course. I understand.

03:43.265 --> 03:45.016
Look, listen. Listen.

03:45.100 --> 03:49.186
Let me talk to my wife, all right?
Before everybody goes nuts here.

03:49.271 --> 03:51.188
Okay. Yeah. Good, fine.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.649
Shit.

03:54.026 --> 03:55.985
What can I tell you, people?

03:56.069 --> 03:58.821
I'm working with one hand
tied behind my back here.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.616
The budget is the budget,
can't do anything about that.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.701
Be that as it may,

04:03.785 --> 04:07.204
it's my job to squeeze
every last bit out of my resources.

04:07.289 --> 04:11.042
To that end,
I'm assessing your performance

04:11.126 --> 04:13.294
and I'm not doing it privately.

04:15.005 --> 04:16.297
Zoey.

04:17.758 --> 04:18.841
Good.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.012
Thor. Improving.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.515
Sam, you need work.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.559
-Jackie...
-Don't even think about it.

04:28.644 --> 04:32.563
Wouldn't dream of it. Jackie,
Sam is gonna shadow you this morning.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.358
Watch and learn, young man.

04:35.442 --> 04:37.443
Always watching, always learning.

04:38.236 --> 04:41.238
Whatever it is, work it out.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.456
-I do not like that guy.
-I do not care.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.166
Take it up with HR.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.086
I'd be happy to go to HR.

04:55.170 --> 04:57.254
Shouldn't you be peeing
in a cup somewhere?

04:57.339 --> 04:58.839
Shouldn't you?

05:00.509 --> 05:04.387
-Hey, Kev, what's up?
-Spagnolo wants us to explain the cast.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.389
You've gotta be kidding me.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.473
Nope.

05:07.557 --> 05:09.850
You know, Spagnolo needs to mind
his own goddamn business.

05:09.935 --> 05:14.313
If every parent of every kid who showed up
with a black eye or a chipped tooth

05:14.398 --> 05:15.856
had to explain themselves
when we were kids,

05:15.941 --> 05:17.024
can you fucking imagine?

05:17.109 --> 05:18.442
I know, I'm with you.

05:18.527 --> 05:20.111
-Shit.
-What?

05:20.821 --> 05:23.322
I gotta take Grace to Dr. Bowen at 4:00.

05:23.407 --> 05:26.826
Fuck. The shrink. I forgot.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.621
All right, let me take her. I'll take Grace.

05:30.706 --> 05:33.582
Okay, great, yes.
You handle Grace, I'll handle Fiona.

05:33.667 --> 05:34.917
Jackie...

05:53.061 --> 05:56.605
-May I help you?
-I need a Town Car and a saw.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.566
You're a real little day brightener,
aren't you?

05:58.650 --> 06:00.234
-I try.
-Great.

06:02.112 --> 06:04.655
-Can you leave that on?
-Can I?

06:04.740 --> 06:07.825
And the lab coat and the badge.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.077
It just gets better and better.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.252
Did everybody see how carefully

06:18.336 --> 06:21.797
Dr. O'Hara used her saw
to free Fiona's arm?

06:21.882 --> 06:23.340
-Yes.
-Yes.

06:23.425 --> 06:26.260
The arm that was not actually broken.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.022
How does it feel, Miss Fiona?

06:38.106 --> 06:40.232
Itchy. Tingly.

06:41.777 --> 06:45.529
Now, children.
Had this been an actual broken bone,

06:45.614 --> 06:47.948
Fiona's arm would be quite bruised

06:48.033 --> 06:51.577
and she wouldn't
be able to wiggle her fingers like this.

06:52.079 --> 06:54.080
Wiggle your fingers, sweetheart.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.957
Are we satisfied?

06:57.834 --> 07:00.878
Real blood, fake cast.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.172
Here you go.

07:04.633 --> 07:07.218
Okay, everyone, happy show and tell!

07:08.053 --> 07:10.387
Lives to save. Shall we?

07:10.639 --> 07:12.723
-Bye.
-Bye.

07:12.808 --> 07:13.849
Bye.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.947
Is everything okay with you guys?

07:28.031 --> 07:31.117
Not really. And not now.

07:31.576 --> 07:32.660
Okay.

07:32.744 --> 07:36.080
It's not that I'm unwilling to discuss it,
but just not here.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.164
Of course.

07:37.249 --> 07:38.499
Jacks.

07:40.877 --> 07:43.003
What if I came to Queens tonight?

07:43.088 --> 07:45.089
And what if you and Kevin and I had

07:45.173 --> 07:49.009
a bottle of scotch
and a plate of those little monkey bits?

07:50.512 --> 07:52.179
-Buffalo wings?
-Yeah.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.349
-Fucking appalling.
-You got it.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.731
-You can stop laughing.
-You...

08:03.692 --> 08:06.193
You grabbed an old lady's breasts

08:06.278 --> 08:09.572
and she keeled over and died.
It's pretty funny.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.490
Wait, remember that time
in ninth grade when

08:11.575 --> 08:15.536
What's-her-face's mom waited up till, like,
4:00 in the morning, pissed,

08:15.620 --> 08:19.540
standing in the doorway
in her ratty old robe with a cup of coffee?

08:19.624 --> 08:24.086
And you kept reaching for her tits
and I kept having to hold your arm down.

08:28.717 --> 08:30.509
What about you?

08:30.594 --> 08:32.011
What about me?

08:32.095 --> 08:36.140
No, 'cause I know this guy, a little bit older,

08:36.224 --> 08:40.227
smart, likes all that indie crap you like.
Public radio.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.564
Might go to plays, I'm not sure.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.399
Really cool.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.153
Gunshot coming in.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.863
Hey, wait, wait, wait.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.991
All right, this guy, is he anything like you?

08:54.075 --> 08:55.242
Total opposite.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.244
Count me in.

08:58.413 --> 09:01.040
Great. I'll set you up.

09:01.416 --> 09:05.252
24-year-old female found down
Union Square, witnessed fall, came to.

09:05.337 --> 09:07.755
Not another skinny chick
from Vogue skipping breakfast

09:07.839 --> 09:09.131
and passing out on the subway.

09:09.257 --> 09:10.841
Pump her with fluids
and get her out of the way,

09:10.926 --> 09:12.968
-we've got a gunshot coming.
-I want the gunshot.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.429
Excuse me, I'm your gunshot.

09:16.097 --> 09:17.223
Assholes.

09:17.933 --> 09:21.477
And by the way, I'm at Allure, not Vogue.
So fucking bite me.

09:21.561 --> 09:23.103
I stand corrected.

09:23.271 --> 09:26.815
So there was, like, a pop on the platform,

09:27.108 --> 09:29.777
but I was halfway in the train,
so I couldn't really tell.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.403
-Which train?
-The Six.

09:31.488 --> 09:34.531
-So you live where, Union Square?
-Gramercy. Anyway...

09:34.616 --> 09:36.242
-Mind your business.
-Quit picking on me.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.035
Just her way of showing
how much she likes you.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.453
-Been there and done that.
-I'm sorry?

09:39.537 --> 09:42.831
Excuse me. The bullet in my head.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.960
-Where we at with CT?
-Neuro's on it.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.045
You need a CT to find the bullet?

09:48.296 --> 09:50.047
It's right here, frontal lobe.

09:50.131 --> 09:52.091
We need to know
exactly which vessels are affected.

09:52.175 --> 09:53.968
They were trying to avoid a bleed.

09:56.221 --> 09:57.554
Oh, my God.

09:58.598 --> 10:00.266
New York Mag, "If looks could cure."

10:01.726 --> 10:03.519
Took me till now.

10:04.312 --> 10:08.315
If I make it out of surgery,
you want to get a drink?

10:08.984 --> 10:10.859
Surgery's gonna be a breeze.

10:11.194 --> 10:12.236
Cool.

10:12.654 --> 10:14.947
Do not make promises you cannot keep.

10:15.031 --> 10:18.075
Dr. Cooper,
neuro's gonna meet you in the OR.

10:18.159 --> 10:21.328
-Is there anybody you want me to contact?
-My mom.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.419
I'm so scared.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.507
Lily, look at me. Do I look scared?

10:34.592 --> 10:35.884
No.

10:35.969 --> 10:39.013
If I'm not scared, you shouldn't be scared.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.890
There's a lot going on.

10:44.269 --> 10:46.687
I will be there when you wake up.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.981
-Okay.
-Okay?

10:49.065 --> 10:50.065
Thank you.

11:02.871 --> 11:04.538
Do you fucking mind?

11:08.710 --> 11:11.170
I don't think
he's a good candidate for tough love.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.006
-I didn't ask.
-Copy that.

11:21.056 --> 11:22.806
-Excuse me, sir. Sir...
-Can I help you?

11:22.891 --> 11:24.224
My husband's in respiratory failure

11:24.309 --> 11:26.101
and they wouldn't let me
ride in the ambulance.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.312
-I need to sit.
-Yes, you probably do. Yes.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.064
-Have you seen him?
-What's his name?

11:30.148 --> 11:32.733
-Markus Franke.
-Where's Markus Franke?

11:33.026 --> 11:35.361
-O'Hara. Trauma one.
-All right. Come with me.

11:36.154 --> 11:37.738
He was changing a light bulb.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.823
That's what he was doing,
changing a light bulb.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.701
-I'm John Decker.
-Jackie Peyton, nice to meet you.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.662
-You will thank me.
-I will not thank you.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.499
What on earth makes
you think I need an assist?

11:48.583 --> 11:51.502
No, no, no.
I'm doing it more for her than you.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.004
I'm telling you, you're right up her alley.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.715
Yeah, well, news flash.
I'm up a lot of girls' alleys.

11:57.967 --> 11:59.218
Did that come out wrong?

11:59.761 --> 12:03.680
Actually, it did.
But the point is, I'm good, Coop.

12:03.765 --> 12:05.265
-I'm good.
-Yeah.

12:05.350 --> 12:09.269
But the question is could you be better?

12:14.442 --> 12:16.402
The thing is, I am seeing someone.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.988
But to tell you the truth,
sometimes it doesn't feel like

12:20.073 --> 12:23.450
that much of a two-way street,
if you get my drift.

12:25.703 --> 12:27.329
Not sure that I do.

12:27.414 --> 12:29.081
Hey! What's up, All Saints?

12:29.165 --> 12:30.499
What's up?

12:31.626 --> 12:32.960
Do you believe that?

12:35.422 --> 12:37.089
Sadly, Coop, I do.

12:41.553 --> 12:44.888
See, that's Georgia. Just saying.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.641
When was that taken?

12:48.393 --> 12:50.602
This morning. Right?

12:53.648 --> 12:54.731
I'm in.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.358
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.904
That chair belongs in admitting.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.824
Leave him alone, Gloria.
He's not going anywhere.

13:03.908 --> 13:06.160
Did I ask him to go anywhere?

13:06.244 --> 13:07.703
Sir, did I ask you to go anywhere?

13:07.787 --> 13:09.329
No, ma'am, you did not.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.627
Excuse me.

13:15.712 --> 13:16.879
Zoey, go around.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.923
No, I meant "excuse me"
because I thought I might bump into him,

13:20.008 --> 13:22.593
not "excuse me"
because I want him to move.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.178
Excuse me, I'm right here.

13:24.262 --> 13:26.430
And I, for one, do not want you to move.

13:27.348 --> 13:32.227
Can I get you anything?
Diet Coke? Meal tray? Ensure?

13:32.770 --> 13:34.271
No, thank you.

13:39.527 --> 13:41.278
Hospital's got a new handyman?

13:41.613 --> 13:45.949
No, he is a paper hanger
and his husband's in respiratory failure.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.249
I'm Dr. Cooper.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.084
-Welcome to All Saints.
-John Decker.

13:56.878 --> 14:00.130
Ordinarily, I'd say, "Pleased to meet you,"

14:00.215 --> 14:01.798
but I'm not pleased
to meet anyone, right now.

14:01.883 --> 14:03.091
Got it.

14:08.598 --> 14:12.059
It might comfort you
to know that I have two moms.

14:13.394 --> 14:16.563
-Comfort me why?
-Because you're married

14:18.733 --> 14:20.025
to a guy.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.246
He's a mess.

14:33.414 --> 14:36.083
And thank you for paving the way.

14:37.502 --> 14:40.045
Can I not be gay right now?

14:40.129 --> 14:43.757
Can I just be a guy whose spouse is dying?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.677
Can I have that, please?

14:54.894 --> 14:57.062
-You're John?
-I am.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.356
Could we have a word in my office?

14:59.440 --> 15:01.024
What's wrong with right here?

15:01.818 --> 15:04.152
Blocking the hallway, not that it matters.

15:04.779 --> 15:08.907
I want to stay nearby.
Twenty-six years, we got this far, right?

15:09.826 --> 15:10.867
Jackie.

15:12.787 --> 15:16.415
Chest pains are not uncommon
with these particular meds, however,

15:16.499 --> 15:18.834
patient proceeded
to go into respiratory failure which...

15:18.918 --> 15:20.669
I'm sorry, you just...

15:20.753 --> 15:23.463
My stomach got a little...
when you called him "patient."

15:24.132 --> 15:27.301
How about he's Markus, until he's not?

15:31.764 --> 15:35.851
My concern at this stage of the game
is that the body's failing

15:35.977 --> 15:39.062
and the heart wants to follow suit,
but the defib won't let it.

15:40.690 --> 15:44.568
What I think is that you need to speak
with Dr. Hayes from cardiology,

15:44.652 --> 15:49.489
who may or may not broach the subject
of deactivating your husband's defibrillator.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.493
Well, Dr. Hayes is gonna have to
come to us. We're not going to him.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.162
-Her.
-Her.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.666
-What's he at?
-His sat's at 80.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.170
He's not in any pain, is he?

16:04.213 --> 16:05.380
-No.
-No.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.845
He has more brains asleep
than Einstein had awake.

16:12.847 --> 16:13.972
For the record.

16:17.518 --> 16:19.227
Lily's out of surgery.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.563
In a minute, Zoey.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.191
They saved the bullet. Yuck.

16:24.275 --> 16:26.902
Who takes the last glove
and leaves the box on the counter?

16:26.986 --> 16:29.946
My bad.
"When you are wrong, promptly admit it."

16:31.032 --> 16:32.532
That's from AA.

16:34.369 --> 16:36.203
You are deeply sober.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.222
How are you doing over there, Mr. Decker?

16:56.724 --> 16:58.475
How do you think?

17:04.691 --> 17:07.234
Who do you think made all these pictures?

17:08.903 --> 17:11.655
I think her patients probably made them.

17:14.617 --> 17:16.159
Am I a patient?

17:18.204 --> 17:20.622
Well, let's see if we like Dr. Bowen first.

17:25.545 --> 17:28.338
I think it would be good to be a patient.

17:33.428 --> 17:34.678
Those hard to change?

17:34.762 --> 17:36.304
Catheter? No. It's very easy.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.391
"Sing to him, each spring to him,

17:39.475 --> 17:42.436
"and worship the trousers
that cling to him."

17:43.396 --> 17:46.189
That's Rodgers and Hart.
You probably didn't know that.

17:46.274 --> 17:48.108
No, I probably didn't.

17:50.403 --> 17:53.613
Dr. Hayes is on her way, EKG in hand.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.870
He's quite elegant, isn't he?

17:59.954 --> 18:04.249
You think it's crazy that a guy like him
would spend his life with a guy like me?

18:04.959 --> 18:07.169
Don't think it's crazy at all.

18:11.132 --> 18:12.966
I think it's a little crazy.

18:16.596 --> 18:19.723
-Mr. Decker.
-Okay, I will leave you two alone.

18:19.807 --> 18:23.769
-There are three of us.
-Indeed there are. I'm sorry.

18:26.272 --> 18:27.689
How did it go with Dr. Bowen?

18:27.774 --> 18:29.399
I think she likes her.

18:29.484 --> 18:32.402
Well, that's good, right?
Can you put Gracie on?

18:32.487 --> 18:34.529
She doesn't want to talk to you, babe.

18:34.614 --> 18:38.825
I'm sorry. I don't know what to do.
Do you want me to ask her again?

18:39.410 --> 18:42.996
No, let her be. Bye.

18:53.925 --> 18:57.052
Do you ever suddenly hate
the way your hair stuff smells?

19:12.193 --> 19:14.110
That looks about right.

19:17.698 --> 19:22.244
So she's got other people in her life?
You know, what are you gonna do?

19:27.875 --> 19:30.001
For whatever it's worth,
it is possible to love

19:30.086 --> 19:32.379
more than one person at a time.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.174
I love Kevin. I love Eddie.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.595
I might love Eddie.

19:42.473 --> 19:45.433
I'd rather be dead than be Kevin or Eddie.

19:50.815 --> 19:54.401
Don't get me wrong, I liked Sarah,
but I'm glad she's gone.

19:58.573 --> 20:02.158
What can I say? I like being your girl.

20:09.250 --> 20:12.002
Jackie, I'm one short for half a shift.
I need you.

20:12.086 --> 20:14.254
You can't have me. What's going on?

20:15.172 --> 20:19.009
Guy was a lawyer, he's got a DNR,
husband signed for the deactivation

20:19.093 --> 20:21.511
-and now he's back-pedaling.
-So, he's not ready.

20:22.096 --> 20:25.682
I've got an eighth grade
cello recital in 45 minutes.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.934
Same thing happened
during the Christmas concert.

20:33.858 --> 20:35.567
I just wanted to say good night.

20:36.110 --> 20:38.320
-Can I ask you something?
-Sure.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.032
How do they,

20:42.116 --> 20:45.285
-you know, when...
-The cardiologist didn't tell you?

20:46.746 --> 20:48.038
I don't like her.

20:48.456 --> 20:51.333
Well, Dr. Hayes will

20:51.417 --> 20:54.502
wave a little device over his heart.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.296
It just takes a couple of seconds.

20:56.380 --> 21:01.259
And whatever he has in there,
pacemaker, defibrillator...

21:01.344 --> 21:03.345
Record players, sewing machines...

21:03.429 --> 21:04.804
Yes, it'll all be turned off.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.976
And what if we leave it on?

21:11.979 --> 21:14.564
Well, his body's failing.

21:14.815 --> 21:16.650
And eventually, his heart will stop beating,

21:16.734 --> 21:18.652
but the defibrillator
will shock it back to life.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.821
So the heart will just continue to beat.

21:21.906 --> 21:23.657
But the rest of him will be gone?

21:25.701 --> 21:27.452
It's a quality-of-life thing.

21:28.037 --> 21:30.080
My life's gonna suck either way.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.668
And if we deactivate it?

21:35.503 --> 21:37.462
Well, he will go back
to the heart he was born with.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.340
Which is a shitty heart,
you know what I mean?

21:41.342 --> 21:43.051
More than you know.

21:47.682 --> 21:49.724
Okay, we're getting there.

21:52.436 --> 21:55.814
Will it hurt when they turn it off?

21:58.150 --> 21:59.317
No.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.698
Just wondering how we're doing in here.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.826
What's the matter,
you got someplace else you gotta be?

22:07.910 --> 22:10.620
Am I keeping you?
Is he fucking with your schedule?

22:10.705 --> 22:13.790
Lucky for you,
this is going down on my timeline.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.333
My timeline.

22:16.043 --> 22:18.753
I say when, not you, not her,
not them assholes

22:18.838 --> 22:20.547
in the other room who still
want their fucking chair back.

22:20.631 --> 22:23.883
I say when. Me, John Decker.

22:25.219 --> 22:27.303
I have four hours of overtime.

22:27.388 --> 22:29.514
Going, going...

22:30.516 --> 22:32.183
Who has seniority?

22:34.895 --> 22:36.980
Zoey Barkow, you want the shift?

22:37.064 --> 22:39.274
Oh, my God, I'm so flattered.

22:39.358 --> 22:42.235
Don't be. All you did was get here first.

22:42.319 --> 22:44.070
I'm still flattered.

22:51.912 --> 22:54.372
The Jell-O and the broth
treating you all right?

22:55.750 --> 22:57.208
Fine, thanks.

22:59.920 --> 23:04.424
Hey, what'd I tell you?
Surgery was a breeze.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.301
Was I right or was I right?

23:09.430 --> 23:11.431
Jackie, thought you left.

23:12.600 --> 23:13.892
I heard you saved the bullet.

23:14.602 --> 23:15.685
Check it out.

23:18.773 --> 23:20.565
Are you afraid to touch it?

23:20.649 --> 23:21.691
A little.

23:22.777 --> 23:25.361
-You owe me a drink.
-Top of my list.

23:31.952 --> 23:33.119
May I?

23:39.293 --> 23:40.794
That was in my brain.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.047
Which is fine, by the way.

23:44.131 --> 23:45.632
Yes, I heard.

23:50.179 --> 23:54.182
You said you were going to be there
when I woke up.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.563
It was the only reason
I didn't completely lose my shit.

24:02.149 --> 24:06.194
I know, honey. And then the day
just sort of got away from me. I'm sorry.

24:09.615 --> 24:10.907
Do you want me to get rid of this for you?

24:10.991 --> 24:12.784
I want you to hang on to it.

24:15.996 --> 24:18.123
Keep your fucking promises.

24:26.215 --> 24:28.299
Monkey bits for the ladies.

24:28.759 --> 24:30.176
Welcome to the Red Owl.

24:30.678 --> 24:34.305
This may very well turn out
to be my favorite place on the planet.

24:34.640 --> 24:36.015
No Sarah tonight?

24:38.477 --> 24:40.186
What? I like her. She's great.

24:42.982 --> 24:45.066
Fuck. Sorry.

24:45.151 --> 24:48.194
No. Nonsense regarding apologies.

24:48.279 --> 24:50.697
And double nonsense
regarding putting that back on the shelf.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.282
That stays right here.

24:53.367 --> 24:55.076
No, no, come on. You're my guest.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.537
-I drink a lot.
-I have a lot.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.165
Okay, that... So, you both win.

25:00.958 --> 25:02.542
Here's to us.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.549
You were a big hit with the second grade.

25:10.467 --> 25:13.303
Probably helped us dodge a bullet
from Protective Services.

25:13.387 --> 25:14.470
Don't even kid.

25:16.223 --> 25:18.725
-Yo, Eddie, what's up?
-Hey.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.895
Oh, my God, he's completely mad.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.273
Kevin, Jackie, I want you to meet Georgia.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.567
-Hi.
-Hi.

25:27.651 --> 25:31.154
Hey, I'm Eddie. You look familiar.

25:31.238 --> 25:32.947
Isn’t that funny?

25:33.699 --> 25:36.951
She's a friend of mine from work.
There's no reason you would know her.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.912
No. No. I know I know you.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.456
I'm assuring you, you don't.

25:41.707 --> 25:43.833
He's just saying you look familiar.

25:44.293 --> 25:47.545
So what do we drink? Scotch.
Somebody means business.

25:47.630 --> 25:51.007
I'm not getting back on your bike
if you drink.

25:51.675 --> 25:54.594
Then I guess I'll have a Coke and a smoke.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.848
Can I have a large Coca-Cola
with a lot of ice

25:58.933 --> 26:01.267
and whatever the cutie is having?

26:03.270 --> 26:06.022
I hate making out with smokers.

26:06.190 --> 26:08.608
Well, no one's got a gun to your head.
Right?

26:08.817 --> 26:10.818
So, how did you guys meet?

26:11.528 --> 26:13.363
My buddy, Coop, introduced us.

26:13.447 --> 26:15.865
Hey, Jackie,
don't you work with a guy named Coop?

26:15.950 --> 26:20.411
God, Jacks, do you know what?
God, I completely forgot.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.664
-It's really important.
-What?

26:22.748 --> 26:25.416
-Kev, it's been delightful as always.
-Come on. You're leaving?

26:25.501 --> 26:28.336
You know what, honey? I should go
with her, okay? It's been a rough day.

26:29.338 --> 26:32.006
-And lovely to meet you, Georgia, is it?
-Yes, yes.

26:32.299 --> 26:33.841
Kev, your machine's broken.

26:34.468 --> 26:36.970
You know what?
It's only working with quarters.

26:39.807 --> 26:41.683
Thanks, honey, I'll see you later.

26:44.144 --> 26:45.311
Nice to meet you.

26:46.313 --> 26:50.400
Take your cigs, take your girl,
get the fuck out of my bar.

26:50.484 --> 26:52.235
Thanks, Jackie.
