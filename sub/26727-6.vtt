WEBVTT

00:01.501 --> 00:02.502
Mr. Anzai,

00:02.961 --> 00:04.379
drink my blood.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.675
I'll give you a little every day!

00:10.343 --> 00:14.431
The man who stabbed the weather forecaster
fell from a nearby apartment...

00:15.348 --> 00:17.350
What exactly did you tell Tsukasa?

00:17.851 --> 00:19.519
Hey, it's wrong to attack people.

00:19.978 --> 00:21.312
What did you tell him?

00:21.396 --> 00:23.481
Blood tolerance? Treatment? Lifespan?

00:26.234 --> 00:28.653
She looked a vampire in the eye
and asked it to drink her blood.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.363
Did you tell her to do that?

00:30.697 --> 00:32.949
I didn't make her do anything.

00:33.408 --> 00:37.996
But to think you would transform
just by hearing her say that,

00:38.455 --> 00:40.457
is something else happening to you?

00:42.333 --> 00:44.002
Whether it's fiction or religion,

00:44.085 --> 00:45.628
stop with this nonsense!

00:45.754 --> 00:47.005
They're not nonsense.

00:47.338 --> 00:48.882
There have been cases, right?

00:49.340 --> 00:52.218
Like when your cells begin to regenerate
after drinking blood.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.721
If I wasn't there to feed you blood,

00:54.971 --> 00:58.391
you would have died
from the holes in your lungs.

00:58.892 --> 01:00.477
Were you that close to dying
that you forgot?

01:00.560 --> 01:03.730
Or did you even listen
to the enemy's story?

01:04.064 --> 01:05.398
Her mother was killed by a vampire,

01:05.482 --> 01:08.193
and now she thinks all vampires
are bloodsucking rapists.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.738
Now, she has become a terrorist
who kills vampires brutally.

01:14.991 --> 01:16.743
The sniper from that time?

01:17.452 --> 01:21.039
Does it make you want to cry?
Don't tell me you feel sorry for her?

01:21.706 --> 01:25.877
Carrying around human blood
and talking nonsense,

01:26.336 --> 01:29.172
there's no way I would trust
someone like you!

01:29.422 --> 01:30.507
You're right.

01:31.090 --> 01:32.675
Promise to hide me for a while, okay?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.969
If you do, I'll introduce myself properly.

01:35.261 --> 01:38.932
Oh, I do have blood,
but I haven't killed anyone.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.893
And I'll tell you this much.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.563
Weaklings who are swayed by emotion

01:46.022 --> 01:47.607
can't protect anyone.

03:21.451 --> 03:24.954
I should have asked someone to bring this.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.416
He might not want to talk to me right now.

03:29.125 --> 03:30.585
Why should I cry?

03:31.127 --> 03:32.921
I bet Mr. Anzai feels like crying.

03:35.173 --> 03:38.676
Mr. Anzai, I'm leaving some ramen here.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.182
Did he really recover
after drinking blood?

03:44.641 --> 03:48.561
Well, Sawazaki said he would tell Anzai
that he was only shot in the shoulder

03:48.770 --> 03:52.273
and, even if he lost a lot of blood,
the wound wasn't serious and healed fast.

03:52.774 --> 03:54.484
You mean, he made a false report?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.154
I'll calm my thoughts on the roof.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.824
Mr. Anzai's red eyes,

04:02.367 --> 04:05.119
I saw them the first time we met.

04:05.954 --> 04:09.165
When we locked eyes on the train,
I thought he was scary.

04:09.624 --> 04:12.961
His red eyes seem to always be in pain.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.967
They seem kind, as if he were crying.

04:20.134 --> 04:22.136
He has protected me this far,

04:23.137 --> 04:25.473
from bad people and even bad dreams.

04:26.224 --> 04:29.560
But I haven't been able
to return the favor.

04:41.406 --> 04:42.490
That was unexpected!

04:42.740 --> 04:44.993
Maybe I shouldn't have run?

04:45.660 --> 04:50.498
Weaklings who are swayed by emotion
can't protect anyone.

04:51.165 --> 04:52.500
He's right.

04:54.585 --> 04:56.504
I need strength to protect her.

05:03.469 --> 05:04.887
I'm alive?

05:05.847 --> 05:08.599
I had a dream about my mom

05:10.143 --> 05:11.602
and the vampire that looked like a human.

05:13.187 --> 05:16.357
Kenichi Morisawa.
That's the vampire's name.

05:16.524 --> 05:17.692
Should you be getting up?

05:20.320 --> 05:23.740
The weather forecaster
is in the next room.

05:23.906 --> 05:25.658
She's alive. Isn't that great?

05:26.367 --> 05:27.952
A man like a vampire.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.997
Congratulations on your recovery.

05:31.622 --> 05:33.207
Why didn't you just kill me?

05:34.083 --> 05:36.919
You bit me, right?
Like you were a vampire?

05:38.421 --> 05:40.757
It was as if you turned into a vampire.
It was amazing.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.218
Shut up! When I'm questioned,
I'll tell them you're behind it!

05:44.510 --> 05:47.430
Whatever. Just know
that more people will die.

05:48.473 --> 05:51.142
More importantly,
I have to tell him you're okay.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.687
Your friend who said
we would be executing Plan B.

05:55.980 --> 05:57.482
Don't you lay a finger on Zero-Nine!

05:59.233 --> 06:01.486
You actually thought you could betray us!

06:07.575 --> 06:11.079
As a result of the Ikebukuro incident,
Tokyo had a total of 36 transformations.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.332
For human casualties, the weather reporter
is in critical condition,

06:14.415 --> 06:16.000
and the suspect died from his fall.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.711
Two others in Ikebukuro
got light injuries.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.172
One in the Shinjuku electronics store
got light injuries.

06:21.589 --> 06:23.925
One who works at an IT company
in Itabashi got light injuries.

06:24.675 --> 06:25.843
Any vampire casualties?

06:26.260 --> 06:31.516
A vampire at an electronics store
was beaten and then died at the hospital.

06:32.141 --> 06:36.229
A West Ikebukuro officer
shot and killed a female vampire.

06:36.896 --> 06:40.775
A report about a vampire in Nerima
got surrounded and beaten by a mob...

06:40.983 --> 06:45.446
Murder is murder, but do you really think
it's still a crime?

06:46.155 --> 06:48.324
People who see a vampire
for the first time and kill it

06:48.407 --> 06:50.743
can be charged with murder,
and I don't agree with that.

06:51.452 --> 06:54.122
What will happen to the privacy policy
of the vampires' personal information?

06:54.288 --> 06:56.207
Considering the restraints
on the press have ended.

06:56.707 --> 06:59.043
Do you plan to comment on the issue
at the press conference?

06:59.627 --> 07:02.797
We won't. To be exact, we can't.

07:03.297 --> 07:06.467
It's not within the Tokyo Metropolitan
Police Department's jurisdiction

07:06.551 --> 07:08.052
to publicize the existence of vampires.

07:08.594 --> 07:12.181
The issue of vampires is a national one.

07:12.473 --> 07:15.059
In addition, all vampire agents
in the Public Security Intelligence Agency

07:15.143 --> 07:16.978
are hereby suspended from duty.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.523
Wait a minute. Suspended from duty?

07:20.773 --> 07:24.527
We would be in trouble if the world knew
we were dealing with vampires.

07:28.656 --> 07:29.490
Here.

07:29.574 --> 07:32.076
Your princess brought you that, you know?

07:32.910 --> 07:36.330
Good timing. Carry her
to the guest room, Prince Charming.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.249
She was tired and fell asleep.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.377
She's not a bad girl, this one.

07:41.919 --> 07:43.504
Stay by her side.

07:47.550 --> 07:51.387
She won't wake up. She must be exhausted.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.569
How do I remove this?

08:16.162 --> 08:19.415
That's a deep scar.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.961
It won't happen again.

08:28.007 --> 08:29.842
This is the last of it.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.012
I have to call a donor and get more.

08:37.266 --> 08:40.645
So, they hid the fact that Anzai
drank human blood and recovered.

08:40.937 --> 08:42.772
I guess drinking blood is illegal.

08:43.272 --> 08:47.693
When I think about it, ONLO's laboratory
was operating outside the law,

08:48.319 --> 08:50.404
considering they conducted
bloodsucking experiments and all.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.241
Why is it illegal, anyway?

08:53.574 --> 08:57.411
As I thought, in all the bloodsucking
cases in the past 30 years,

08:57.703 --> 09:00.665
there's no report about a vampire
drinking blood and recovering.

09:02.250 --> 09:04.835
If it's the truth,
then why hasn't it been publicized?

09:06.879 --> 09:07.713
YUKI ANZAI
DEATH PENALTY

09:07.797 --> 09:08.965
Sawazaki.

09:09.465 --> 09:10.508
Hey.

09:11.259 --> 09:14.428
We got a call saying someone witnessed
the man falling from the building.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.138
It was too dark to see a face,

09:16.722 --> 09:19.475
but they said someone pushed him
over the railing.

09:20.226 --> 09:21.310
Who is the informant?

09:22.061 --> 09:23.896
An employee at the bar behind the scene.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.024
Ryunosuke Katagiri.

09:31.821 --> 09:34.991
What a nice day.
It's starting to look like spring.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.580
You don't need to do anything.

09:45.793 --> 09:48.379
It has started snowing.

09:52.174 --> 09:55.261
What was I dreaming about?

09:56.846 --> 09:59.515
I usually remember my dreams.

10:01.559 --> 10:03.728
Were you able to contact the informant?

10:04.895 --> 10:06.564
Yes. I'm heading to the bar now.

10:07.523 --> 10:10.276
I'll drive. Squad B has too many people.

10:10.776 --> 10:11.611
Thanks.

10:12.486 --> 10:13.487
MIWAKO TODA

10:14.155 --> 10:15.740
Miwako? It has been a long time.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.534
You finally picked up!
Tsukasa, are you okay?

10:19.535 --> 10:20.453
Why?

10:20.703 --> 10:21.621
"Why?"

10:21.829 --> 10:25.124
There are pictures and videos of
yesterday's incident in Ikebukuro online!

10:25.249 --> 10:29.837
One of those pictures had you in it!
You were running from a vampire.

10:31.380 --> 10:33.299
Vampires attacking humans.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.718
Humans beating vampires.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.471
Vampires flying around like ninjas.

10:38.679 --> 10:40.598
None of it seems real!

10:40.848 --> 10:43.184
It all looks like a made-up joke.

10:44.435 --> 10:48.105
Miwako, vampires are real.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.733
Normally, they're just like other people,

10:51.484 --> 10:53.402
but when they see blood,
they lose control,

10:53.861 --> 10:57.031
so they try to avoid the sight of blood.

10:57.531 --> 11:03.120
Sorry. I believe you,
but, Tsukasa, how do you know that?

11:03.954 --> 11:08.042
Hold on. Didn't you say the guy you like
could jump really high?

11:10.294 --> 11:13.214
He can jump from one telephone pole
to another.

11:15.257 --> 11:17.760
But I can trust him, so it's--

11:17.843 --> 11:19.929
You think trusting him
is the problem here?

11:20.805 --> 11:22.431
You said they lose control
when they see blood.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.851
It doesn't matter how much you trust him!

11:26.268 --> 11:29.271
Anyway, you only just met him, Tsukasa.

11:29.563 --> 11:31.816
How well do you even know him?

11:33.984 --> 11:34.902
Sorry.

11:35.069 --> 11:37.488
I'm just worried about you.

11:38.197 --> 11:39.365
Maybe you're right.

11:40.074 --> 11:41.826
I haven't known him that long.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.412
There are a lot of things
I don't know about him.

11:45.371 --> 11:48.624
Like how hard it is to be a vampire
or how it feels to lose control.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.001
I wouldn't be able to understand.

11:51.669 --> 11:52.503
But...

11:55.381 --> 11:58.134
He's a very precious person to me.

12:12.356 --> 12:15.025
Oh, I missed. I'm shocked.

12:16.068 --> 12:17.319
Oryo?

12:18.946 --> 12:21.031
There are other employees here.
What should I do?

12:21.323 --> 12:25.411
If there's an eyewitness account,
we're in trouble. Kill them if you can.

12:26.495 --> 12:30.166
Please don't hurt the people here!

12:30.291 --> 12:32.209
Such a charming show of empathy.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.337
I wouldn't think you're a beast
that sucks human blood.

12:40.968 --> 12:41.802
Watch out!

12:43.262 --> 12:44.513
Shit! After them!

12:46.515 --> 12:48.017
Hey! What the heck is going on?

12:48.392 --> 12:50.728
I'll stay here.
They might still be in danger.

12:51.103 --> 12:52.771
Thanks. I'm borrowing your car!

12:54.732 --> 12:56.484
SORRY ABOUT EARLIER.
IF YOU TRUST HIM, I TRUST YOU.

12:56.567 --> 12:57.401
STAY SAFE!

13:00.696 --> 13:01.614
What's that?

13:03.365 --> 13:06.076
Isn't that the guy
from the New Year's incident?

13:07.620 --> 13:08.704
Who's this guy?

13:09.288 --> 13:11.123
Sawazaki, this is Anzai.

13:11.582 --> 13:12.750
A vampire is being chased.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.002
It's outside our jurisdiction,
but it's an emergency.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.880
The target is the transsexual
from the incident on New Year's.

13:18.088 --> 13:20.174
That's the informant
on the Ikebukuro incident!

13:21.342 --> 13:22.343
Where is she?

13:23.260 --> 13:25.179
She's on the rooftop south of Bar Sakaki.

13:25.262 --> 13:26.430
I have a clear view!

13:26.764 --> 13:29.683
Officer Anzai, I give you permission
to act. Protect the target!

13:29.975 --> 13:32.645
That scruffy guy is a cameraman
for Toei TV.

13:33.062 --> 13:35.689
The vampire was drinking blood
during the incident

13:35.773 --> 13:37.942
until the moment I punched him.

13:38.192 --> 13:41.028
That guy insisted on filming everything,
even if I told him not to.

13:41.195 --> 13:43.781
He was screaming the whole time,
"Kill it already!"

13:45.616 --> 13:48.452
I will assist with the arrest,
Detective Anzai.

13:48.702 --> 13:52.122
That's some talk from a guy
who won't give us his real name.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.459
My name is Johannes Kleeman.

13:55.751 --> 13:59.421
Born as part of the Hybrid Birth Plan,
Term 15, White Group, Number 7.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.049
Raised under the supervision
of ONLO in Obihiro.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.885
You're one to talk, asking me who I am.

14:05.135 --> 14:07.555
What term were you?
What group? What number?

14:09.348 --> 14:12.017
Well, we can leave that for later.
Let's go.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.812
If you get out of control,
I'll just knock you out again.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.278
Lock yourself in and hide!

14:28.617 --> 14:30.327
Hybrid Birth Plan?

14:31.370 --> 14:34.456
Wasn't ONLO just an orphanage
for vampire children?

14:34.999 --> 14:37.376
Attention, Squad F.
Anzai is reporting for duty.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.336
It's an emergency, so I've authorized it.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.714
Jill, stay inside and standby.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.924
What again? Why?

14:44.174 --> 14:45.509
Anzai, you should listen to this, too.

14:45.759 --> 14:48.012
All vampire officers have been temporarily
removed from duty.

14:48.637 --> 14:51.307
However, the safety
of our target is a priority.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.601
So, make sure the higher-ups
don't find out?

14:55.895 --> 14:59.148
I'll just monitor Anzai's
body temperature and pulse.

15:00.024 --> 15:03.861
Hold on. What are you doing?
Nobody's ever done that to me.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.323
I don't really get it, either.
It's part of the health plan.

15:07.656 --> 15:09.491
Just doing what ONLO asked.

15:18.083 --> 15:20.169
In this game of tag,
it's the other way around, isn't it?

15:20.920 --> 15:23.547
Even as a child,
I've always thought it was weird.

15:24.131 --> 15:28.719
"Why don't the ones being chased
help each other and take out who's 'it'?"

15:29.470 --> 15:33.057
Vampires are savages once they transform.
But everyone figures it out!

15:33.557 --> 15:36.644
The difference between the number
of vampires and the number of humans.

15:37.019 --> 15:39.021
From now on,
humans will chase the vampires

15:39.396 --> 15:41.398
and start taking you all out!

15:41.649 --> 15:43.067
Power in numbers, right?

15:45.069 --> 15:47.029
Now it's three on one, isn't it?

15:48.322 --> 15:49.573
Don't draw blood!

15:50.074 --> 15:52.242
Really? Not even at the nosebleed level?

15:52.826 --> 15:55.913
Did you know that murderers
don't have human blood in their veins?

15:56.288 --> 15:57.623
I'm not speaking in metaphors.

15:58.540 --> 15:59.792
What are you trying to say?

16:00.167 --> 16:02.294
This is just ketchup!

16:03.337 --> 16:05.506
That wasn't even funny!

16:06.131 --> 16:09.635
Looks like I got your mind off it.
You stopped changing.

16:10.427 --> 16:15.182
I guess you only change
when you're lusting after Tsukasa.

16:27.611 --> 16:30.364
You even get excited when you see
my blood? I'm just an old man!

16:30.447 --> 16:32.282
Vampires really are pathetic!

16:32.408 --> 16:34.076
Shut up, Ketchup.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.496
You don't even have to listen to this guy.

16:39.373 --> 16:41.542
You have to do what you need to.

16:42.001 --> 16:43.043
What are you saying?

16:43.794 --> 16:45.170
A doctor once told me,

16:45.462 --> 16:49.717
"Sexual lust and bloodlust
come hand in hand. It's physiological.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.802
Rather than relying on sedatives,

16:51.885 --> 16:54.805
it's better to let it out
by masturbating."

16:55.597 --> 16:56.974
Anyway, do you have handcuffs?

16:57.266 --> 17:00.102
We're supposed to admit we have desires
that could drive us to murder?

17:00.769 --> 17:05.274
Whether you admit it or not,
bloodlust exists.

17:05.399 --> 17:07.985
What matters is how you manage it.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.821
He's right.

17:11.572 --> 17:12.448
But...

17:13.240 --> 17:14.908
Anzai! Where's Katagiri?

17:15.617 --> 17:16.827
I'm here.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.539
Hey, aren't you Tsukasa's...

17:21.248 --> 17:22.416
-Lee, you're here, too?
-Hey...

17:23.500 --> 17:25.836
Are the employees at the bar okay?

17:25.919 --> 17:28.714
This man said he would kill them.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.383
There's a detective
standing guard at the bar.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.678
You said she's the informant
from the Ikebukuro incident.

17:34.928 --> 17:36.764
Is that why he was after her?

17:39.183 --> 17:41.727
Anzai, hide Katagiri at Bar Sakaki.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.063
Don't respond to any inquiries
from headquarters.

17:45.147 --> 17:48.317
Katagiri's report hasn't been circulated.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.360
Only one group knows about it.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.613
There's a mole?

17:55.240 --> 17:57.159
You look like your father.

18:00.454 --> 18:02.164
Oh, I was surprised.

18:02.247 --> 18:06.168
The child of light
and a child of darkness together.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.554
You're hurt.

18:20.015 --> 18:21.767
Tsukasa...

18:22.684 --> 18:24.144
Oryo! What are you doing here?

18:24.812 --> 18:27.606
She's an important witness
from the Ikebukuro incident.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.483
What on earth did you see?

18:29.942 --> 18:34.029
They said on the news
that the suspect fell, but it's not true.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.574
I saw it.

18:37.866 --> 18:40.369
He was saying something as he fell.

18:43.038 --> 18:45.582
I think it was "traitor."

18:46.792 --> 18:48.627
Is this from when you were chased?

18:49.461 --> 18:50.295
This is...

18:51.255 --> 18:55.592
No. You did this to yourself,
to distract from your bloodlust, right?

18:56.510 --> 18:58.428
I saw the dead person's blood.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.472
Vampires do it all the time.

19:00.639 --> 19:03.809
One of the other bar employees
said he always does it.

19:04.852 --> 19:08.438
He would ask,
"What's going to happen to us?"

19:10.315 --> 19:12.109
Johannes, look after Oryo.

19:12.442 --> 19:15.070
I'll go in through the window
and come downstairs once I'm okay.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.781
Anzai, we have to bandage your wounds!

19:18.115 --> 19:20.742
I'm fine. Just go to your room.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.454
Don't worry about him.

19:25.414 --> 19:28.083
He's just trying to manage his bloodlust.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.589
Is Tsukasa angry?

19:34.089 --> 19:38.218
This bloodlust exists.
I can't change that.

19:38.927 --> 19:39.761
But,

19:40.679 --> 19:44.892
if I accept that this is normal,
then I'm practically...

19:46.393 --> 19:48.645
No, it's been like this since we met.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.982
I'm a vampire.

19:53.317 --> 19:56.320
You've lost a lot of blood.
We have to get you to the hospital.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.615
But that Sawazaki person said
we have to hide her.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.034
Her life's in danger!

20:02.242 --> 20:04.828
What hospitals around here treat vampires?

20:05.495 --> 20:06.872
Shirase Hospital.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.583
Jill, call Sawazaki.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.293
Ms. Taira, go back inside.

20:12.336 --> 20:13.170
Well...

20:18.425 --> 20:19.927
Hey. Where are you going?

20:20.719 --> 20:22.512
I'm taking Oryo to the hospital.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.515
There's no reason for you to go.
Stay here.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.100
It's dangerous out there.

20:29.394 --> 20:30.270
I don't want to.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.274
Makimura. Status report.

20:34.775 --> 20:35.609
Makimura!

20:37.402 --> 20:38.904
No abnormalities.

20:40.697 --> 20:41.782
What about you?

20:42.241 --> 20:45.452
The man is under arrest.
I'm searching for Katagiri.

20:46.036 --> 20:47.246
Don't move from your location.

20:48.288 --> 20:50.123
Understood. Be careful.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.337
Eleven, Zero-Four is under arrest.

20:55.712 --> 20:58.340
And there was a human among
the employees at Bar Cross.

20:58.632 --> 21:01.134
You said they were all vampires.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.136
I hate unreliable people.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.806
Next time you mess up, I'm sending you
to the bottom of the ocean.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.395
Zero-Seven!

21:12.479 --> 21:14.356
SHIRASE HOSPITAL

21:14.648 --> 21:17.067
Uno, do you recognize this woman?

21:17.359 --> 21:18.568
The sniper?

21:18.944 --> 21:19.778
Yes.

21:19.903 --> 21:23.699
I feel like I've seen this name before.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.369
OVERNIGHT EMERGENCY ENTRANCE

21:27.661 --> 21:29.746
Oryo, hang in there! Just a little longer!

21:29.830 --> 21:31.164
She escaped! Hey, stop!

21:33.875 --> 21:35.711
Who's that? A vampire?

21:40.924 --> 21:43.135
That's the woman who shot Mr. Anzai.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.809
Give me the car keys,
or I'll break her neck!

23:31.576 --> 23:32.536
Devil's Line.

23:33.078 --> 23:34.079
Line 7.

23:34.496 --> 23:35.497
Chaser.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.791
