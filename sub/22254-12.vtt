00:14.282 --> 00:16.908
Look alive, bright eyes.

00:16.909 --> 00:18.994
It's the morning and somebody loves you.

00:18.995 --> 00:20.555
Right back at you, buddy.

00:20.580 --> 00:22.331
- Oh, my God. He's here.
- There he is.

00:22.332 --> 00:26.043
- I love you, Mr. Peanutbutter.
- I love you, too.

00:26.044 --> 00:31.507
Idea for a new Pixar movie:
what are pizza boxes thinking about?

00:31.508 --> 00:34.343
- And Leland Stanford?
- Transcontinental Railroad.

00:34.344 --> 00:36.488
- Transcontinental Railroad?
- That is correct.

00:36.513 --> 00:40.765
Next question,
what is my favorite kind of berry?

00:40.766 --> 00:43.185
- Barry Bostwick.
- Raspberry?

00:43.186 --> 00:46.230
I'm so sorry, the correct answer,
of course, was Barry Bostwick.

00:46.231 --> 00:48.899
- How was I supposed to know?
- He also likes Franken Berry.

00:48.900 --> 00:51.235
- We would have accepted Franken Berry.
- What?

00:51.236 --> 00:53.571
- I'm sorry, you lose.
- What the...?

00:53.572 --> 00:56.865
That's our show, but before we go
I wanna send out a quick message.

00:56.866 --> 01:02.787
Diane, if you're watching this, I love you
and I know you're doing great things.

01:02.788 --> 01:08.460
Idea for a new app: an undo button
that could undo long amounts of time.

01:08.461 --> 01:15.133
- Hey, is everyone having a good time? Ha!
- Three months. A year. A life.

01:15.134 --> 01:20.239
Erica, where did that tooth come from?
All right, let's keep this party going.

01:20.265 --> 01:23.909
One click and everything could
just go back to the way it was.

01:28.773 --> 01:31.483
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:31.484 --> 01:36.464
- You're still here?
- Yup. Still here.

02:36.716 --> 02:39.217
- Stop it.
- Wake up, captain dumbshit.

02:39.218 --> 02:42.071
I've been trying to get in touch
with you for two months.

02:42.096 --> 02:44.865
Ow. Okay. I'm awake, I'm awake.

02:45.558 --> 02:47.142
Aah! What is it?

02:47.143 --> 02:52.230
If the studio wants to sue me, tell them
to take my house. I belong to the sea now.

02:52.231 --> 02:55.859
- Are you drunk?
- Only on adventure. And gin.

02:55.860 --> 02:57.486
And vodka. And gin.

02:57.487 --> 03:00.280
They're not gonna sue you.
They finished the movie.

03:00.281 --> 03:04.201
- What? How? Explain yourself, land wench.
- I don't know, ask Turteltaub.

03:04.202 --> 03:07.204
That's not why I'm here.
I thought you were in Cordovia.

03:07.205 --> 03:08.830
You've been here this whole time?

03:08.831 --> 03:13.585
Idea for a thing Princess Carolyn
should do... Shut up.

03:13.586 --> 03:15.379
Get dressed.
We're going to the orphanage.

03:15.380 --> 03:16.505
What orphanage?

03:16.506 --> 03:19.550
Remember at Herb's funeral,
I asked you what you wanted me to do

03:19.551 --> 03:22.862
- with your Horsin' Around residuals?
- I do... not remember that.

03:22.887 --> 03:25.263
You said, "Give it to an orphanage
or something."

03:25.264 --> 03:27.849
- What?
- It turns out you made enough money

03:27.850 --> 03:32.354
to build a brand new one.
So congratulations. You're a hero.

03:32.355 --> 03:33.914
A hero?

03:34.524 --> 03:36.816
That's right, a hero.

03:36.817 --> 03:39.277
Or is it pronounced "gyro?"
I just call them subs.

03:39.278 --> 03:42.531
Anyway, enjoy the sandwich,
you're a great man.

03:42.532 --> 03:45.701
Welcome to
The BoJack Horseman Orphanage.

03:45.702 --> 03:48.620
Or, as we call it,
The BoJack Horsephanage.

03:48.621 --> 03:50.121
You cannot call it that.

03:50.122 --> 03:54.918
A, because I am not a great man and B,
because that is a really stupid name.

03:54.919 --> 03:59.047
- The name was Molly's idea.
- Stop pissing off the orphans.

03:59.048 --> 04:01.759
A lot of them grow up
to be serial killers.

04:16.190 --> 04:19.777
Thank you for that lovely song.
But I'm not a good person.

04:19.778 --> 04:23.280
This is the only good thing I've ever done
and I did it by accident.

04:23.281 --> 04:26.199
And it just goes to show you
life is just... Ah, what am I saying?

04:26.200 --> 04:30.036
I don't have to tell you how hard life is.
You're the ones with the dead parents.

04:30.037 --> 04:32.997
- My parents are dead?
- No. No. Not necessarily.

04:32.998 --> 04:35.041
Maybe they just didn't want you.

04:35.042 --> 04:39.254
My point is,
I don't understand how people live.

04:39.255 --> 04:41.715
It's amazing to me that people
wake up every morning

04:41.716 --> 04:46.529
and say, "Yeah, another day, let's do it."
How do people do it?

04:46.554 --> 04:47.906
I don't know how.

04:48.473 --> 04:50.157
Yay.

04:57.231 --> 05:02.611
So you see, Todd, the nimble improviser
must navigate the most sensitive of areas.

05:02.612 --> 05:05.363
- And I'm not just talking about the butt.
- Ha.

05:05.364 --> 05:09.576
Copernicus, how do you always come
up with these amazing butt jokes?

05:09.577 --> 05:13.913
When you're a Level Nine, as I am,
you don't come up with butt jokes.

05:13.914 --> 05:18.084
You live truthfully in the moment
and the butt joke comes to you.

05:18.085 --> 05:20.170
So true. So wise.

05:20.171 --> 05:23.381
Listen, I need to "shove off,"
as we sailors say,

05:23.382 --> 05:27.260
on my comedy cruise line, the Giggleship.
I shan't be returning.

05:27.261 --> 05:28.696
- Shan't you?
- I shannot.

05:28.721 --> 05:32.390
I'd like you to join me on the high seas,
as my Number Two

05:32.391 --> 05:35.268
and I don't mean that kind of number two.

05:35.269 --> 05:38.414
What, number two, how do you do that?

05:40.817 --> 05:44.486
If it isn't the furshlugginer putz
who cost me 50 grand.

05:44.487 --> 05:47.781
I'm sorry I bailed in the middle of
production. If there's anything I can do.

05:47.782 --> 05:49.700
Do? What do? Movie's finished.

05:49.701 --> 05:51.910
- We fixed the whole thing in post.
- Really?

05:51.911 --> 05:55.372
Remember your first week, these nerds
made a computer scan of your head

05:55.373 --> 05:57.290
so we could finish
if something happened?

05:57.291 --> 05:58.876
Please don't call us nerds, sir.

05:58.877 --> 06:01.920
Something happened to you,
so these nerds finished the movie.

06:01.921 --> 06:04.464
Look what Computer BoJack can do.

06:04.465 --> 06:07.384
- Help you out of that tree, ma'am?
- Look at him save that cat.

06:07.385 --> 06:09.427
Now there's a protagonist
we can root for.

06:09.428 --> 06:11.823
- You did all that in the computer?
- Not just that.

06:11.848 --> 06:16.434
Computer BoJack had so much charisma
and screen presence we ended up going back

06:16.435 --> 06:19.563
- and replacing you in every scene.
- I'm not in the movie at all?

06:19.564 --> 06:23.316
Not technically, but computer you
is giving the performance of your career.

06:23.317 --> 06:25.360
When people see what you do in this movie,

06:25.361 --> 06:27.529
they are gonna storm
Daniel Day-Lewis's house,

06:27.530 --> 06:30.114
schlep him out into the street,
shoot him in the head.

06:30.115 --> 06:31.909
That's how good your performance is.

06:31.910 --> 06:34.160
It's gonna make Daniel Day-Lewis
look like shit.

06:34.161 --> 06:37.414
- They're gonna hate Daniel Day-Lewis.
- But it's not my performance.

06:37.415 --> 06:41.084
Explain that the widow Day-Lewis.
She'll be devastated. Kaput. Kapleshky.

06:41.085 --> 06:44.379
Are you Jewish? Because I feel
some of these you're just making up.

06:44.380 --> 06:46.423
We got a screening this weekend.

06:46.424 --> 06:49.551
Come see the movie,
we'll schmooze, we'll kibitz,

06:49.552 --> 06:51.946
schlemiel, schlimazel,
Hasenpfeffer Incorporated.

06:54.933 --> 06:58.309
Just think, Carolyn,
in one week, all of this will be ours.

06:58.310 --> 07:00.938
We should a put a social-media desk there.

07:00.939 --> 07:03.857
If we hire someone to micromanage
our clients' online personas

07:03.858 --> 07:06.985
and new media outreach, they'll seem
more grounded down to earth.

07:06.986 --> 07:09.905
Smiling poop emoji,
I love everything about that.

07:09.906 --> 07:13.617
I wanna make sure the couches
we get are really comfortable.

07:13.618 --> 07:17.704
- Just in case we have some late nights.
- Mr. Rabitowitz.

07:17.705 --> 07:20.206
This is a place of business.

07:20.207 --> 07:23.251
Ugh, can we just freeze in this moment
for a second?

07:23.252 --> 07:26.671
I just wanna remember this instant
where for once in my life,

07:26.672 --> 07:28.715
- everything was going...
- Hold that thought.

07:28.716 --> 07:29.758
What is it?

07:29.759 --> 07:31.927
Ugh. My wife and I are going
to the ballet tonight,

07:31.928 --> 07:33.821
there's a real ish
with the restaurant.

07:33.846 --> 07:36.932
- This is the wife you're divorcing, right?
- You know how it is.

07:36.933 --> 07:40.184
You say you want a divorce
and she says, "No, we can make this work."

07:40.185 --> 07:43.104
You go to counseling and
remember why you fell in love with her

07:43.105 --> 07:45.523
in the first place
and then, blah, blah, it's a whole thing.

07:45.524 --> 07:47.734
We've been sleeping together
for three months.

07:47.735 --> 07:51.488
- We're about to start a company together.
- None of that has to change.

07:51.489 --> 07:55.366
I am definitely going to divorce
her probably, it's just...

07:55.367 --> 07:58.202
Ugh. It's hard to explain to someone
who's never been married.

07:58.203 --> 07:59.579
- Listen, this is...
- Oh!

07:59.580 --> 08:01.665
Sorry, Katie just said something funny.

08:01.666 --> 08:04.810
- What?
- I gotta hop. I love you, though.

08:10.466 --> 08:14.361
Ha, ha. Okay, keep the engine running,
I'll be back in a... Oh.

08:14.846 --> 08:16.989
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:17.015 --> 08:20.851
Um, I'm just here to pick up some stuff.
I'm going away for a while.

08:20.852 --> 08:23.269
- Oh, where?
- The Giggleship.

08:23.270 --> 08:25.897
It's the comedy cruise line
People magazine

08:25.898 --> 08:30.109
- once called "a comedy cruise line."
- Comedy cruise line?

08:30.110 --> 08:34.405
Oh right, your improv thing.
How was your, uh, graduation show?

08:34.405 --> 08:38.076
- It was two months ago. You missed it.
- Sorry.

08:38.077 --> 08:39.452
- No, you're not.
- Well...

08:39.453 --> 08:44.123
Hey, do you remember the morning
after my first night here?

08:44.124 --> 08:47.377
I don't know why everyone keeps asking
if I remember things. I don't.

08:47.378 --> 08:50.463
Just as a general rule,
if your question begins, "Do you remember"

08:50.464 --> 08:53.967
and doesn't end with "how much you hated
Moulin Rouge," the answer's no.

08:53.968 --> 08:57.863
I was so happy to have a place
to stay that I made pancakes.

08:57.889 --> 09:00.223
And you kept eating them
so I kept making them.

09:00.224 --> 09:03.852
And then you got mad at me
for letting you eat so many pancakes.

09:03.853 --> 09:06.938
You tried to chase me around the pool,
but you were too hungover

09:06.939 --> 09:11.860
and also full from the pancakes
so instead... you took a nap.

09:11.861 --> 09:16.907
And when you woke up, you said,
"Thanks for the pancakes.

09:16.908 --> 09:20.493
- Now get out of my house."
- I don't remember any of that.

09:20.494 --> 09:25.040
Well, anyway, I'm finally moving out,
just like you wanted.

09:25.041 --> 09:28.585
Good. Honestly, you'll probably
be better off without me.

09:29.879 --> 09:33.590
Yeah. But we had some good times,
though, right?

09:33.591 --> 09:38.636
- Did we?
- Right. Well, um, take care.

09:38.637 --> 09:42.366
Hey, I hope you can find a way
to be happy, BoJack.

09:42.391 --> 09:45.911
- I really do.
- Yeah, okay.

09:46.812 --> 09:47.913
Hey, Todd?

09:50.858 --> 09:53.335
You need to get your shit together.

09:53.819 --> 09:57.321
- Ugh.
- Rutabaga and I are starting a new agency.

09:57.322 --> 10:00.825
I want you to come onboard
and write celebrity tweets.

10:00.826 --> 10:03.327
- I don't know how to do that.
- You're a ghost-writer.

10:03.328 --> 10:06.497
It's the same as writing a book,
they're just a lot shorter

10:06.498 --> 10:07.999
and more people read them.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.086
All right, but why are you helping me?

10:11.087 --> 10:14.631
Because my life is a mess right now and I
compulsively take care of other people

10:14.632 --> 10:16.507
when I don't know how
to take care of myself.

10:16.508 --> 10:19.803
Oh. I was hoping it was
because you believed in me.

10:19.804 --> 10:20.905
I don't.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.559
Welcome to my Giggleship.

10:26.560 --> 10:30.271
For us, it's a place to realize
our higher selves. For the paying public,

10:30.272 --> 10:34.358
it's a place to watch improv and drink
watered-down margaritas for 8.99.

10:34.359 --> 10:37.403
Wow, we must all make a lot of money.

10:37.404 --> 10:41.908
No, no, you just get paid
in experience and stage time.

10:41.909 --> 10:45.662
- Which in a way is even better than money.
- Say what?

10:45.663 --> 10:47.998
Look, We've arrived
at your living quarters.

10:47.999 --> 10:54.420
Wow. No more couch-sleeping for this guy.
He gets a mattress.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.505
That's the spirit.

10:55.506 --> 10:58.925
And you can use improv to make
this room anything you want it to be.

10:58.926 --> 11:02.738
My cabin is exactly like yours,
but when I use my imagination,

11:02.763 --> 11:06.349
it becomes a rich stateroom
with a treasure chest full of booty.

11:06.350 --> 11:10.228
I like a big booty, if you know what
I mean. And I don't mean a butt.

11:12.106 --> 11:16.501
You really are the master
of spontaneous witticisms.

11:20.739 --> 11:24.201
All right, you ready? This is go time.
There's no turning back now.

11:24.202 --> 11:25.994
- Oh, I am ready.
- Great.

11:25.995 --> 11:29.831
Now let's get out there and tell all those
garbage rat bastard sons of bastards

11:29.832 --> 11:32.416
what we really think of them,
once and for all.

11:32.417 --> 11:34.961
Everyone. We have an announcement.

11:34.962 --> 11:37.005
Guys, we have an announcement.

11:37.006 --> 11:40.299
- What's going on?
- Mr. Witherspoon's in the hospital.

11:40.300 --> 11:42.886
- He had a stroke.
- Oh.

11:42.887 --> 11:45.864
Well, you know what you rat bastards
can stroke?

11:45.890 --> 11:48.183
- Uh... Oh.
- My big, hairy...

11:49.393 --> 11:52.121
Well, we burned that bridge.

11:57.193 --> 12:01.988
Todd, you should be up a magician's
sleeve because you are a card.

12:03.532 --> 12:06.076
Hey, Bryan. What's going on here?

12:06.077 --> 12:09.246
- He refused to scrub the floors.
- Oh, Bryan.

12:09.247 --> 12:12.082
Please. My knees were cramping
so I needed to stand.

12:12.083 --> 12:16.253
But I'm real good at cleaning windows.
Look.

12:16.254 --> 12:20.257
That's solid space-work.
Bryan, don't worry.

12:20.258 --> 12:22.693
I'm gonna go to Copernicus
and get this sorted out.

12:23.594 --> 12:27.489
Copernicus? Uh, Copernicus?

12:27.681 --> 12:29.158
Huh?

12:31.018 --> 12:32.077
Huh.

12:34.563 --> 12:35.914
Whoa.

12:38.734 --> 12:42.570
One Hundred and One Butt Jokes?

12:42.571 --> 12:47.200
"No parking in the rear?"
Aah!

12:47.201 --> 12:51.454
- Copernicus is a fraud!
- A fraud? Me? Ow.

12:51.455 --> 12:54.099
- Aah.
- I had such high hopes for you, Todd.

12:54.125 --> 12:56.709
Normally, I'd make a perfectly
timed butt joke here,

12:56.710 --> 12:59.629
but as you can see,
I don't have my book.

12:59.630 --> 13:02.215
- Oh!
- Guards, take this subversive

13:02.216 --> 13:03.967
to the Yes And room.

13:03.968 --> 13:06.844
- No.
- Hey, what are you doing?

13:06.845 --> 13:11.616
No. Shame on all of you! Just wait
till you see my Trip Advisor review.

13:11.642 --> 13:14.060
This cruise is getting three stars.

13:14.061 --> 13:17.873
Because I have very
mixed feelings about it.

13:21.152 --> 13:24.362
- Carolyn, we are free.
- Yeah.

13:24.363 --> 13:26.530
Real quick, kiss me once.
Then kiss me twice.

13:26.531 --> 13:28.574
I don't want to do that anymore.

13:28.575 --> 13:31.911
- I told you, we can make this work...
- No. I don't want...

13:31.912 --> 13:34.473
Carolyn, you're a single woman
in your 40s.

13:34.498 --> 13:36.833
- Can you really afford to be picky?
- What?

13:36.834 --> 13:40.586
I'm just saying, what, you think you're
gonna find some perfect unattached guy

13:40.587 --> 13:42.380
who's gonna love you like I do?

13:42.381 --> 13:45.091
Who's gonna make you laugh
and feel good about yourself?

13:45.092 --> 13:47.135
This is it, Carolyn, this is what you get.

13:47.136 --> 13:49.220
If you're holding out
for something better,

13:49.221 --> 13:52.824
well, I hate to break it to you, but
you're gonna be alone for a long time.

13:52.850 --> 13:56.412
I'm not afraid of being alone.

13:56.979 --> 13:59.356
And you might wanna find
someplace else to work

13:59.357 --> 14:02.859
- because you're not coming with me.
- Wait, wait, wait, what?

14:02.860 --> 14:05.403
It's my company.
My name is on all the paperwork.

14:05.404 --> 14:08.031
I think I can do it without you.
Good luck.

14:08.032 --> 14:14.346
- Whoa, Carolyn, we just... Come... Carolyn.
- My name is Princess Carolyn.

14:16.415 --> 14:18.875
And as I held that baby in my arms,

14:18.876 --> 14:21.336
I knew I had been given a second chance.

14:21.337 --> 14:26.924
A chance to finally make things right.
And this time, I was gonna win...

14:26.925 --> 14:28.801
the race of life.

14:32.390 --> 14:37.810
- Whoa. That was actually good.
- We're doing a full awards push.

14:37.811 --> 14:40.146
You should clear your schedule
for the next year.

14:40.147 --> 14:42.523
Buckle up, buddy,
this is the year of Secretariat.

14:42.524 --> 14:46.569
But it wasn't Secretariat.
And it wasn't me. It was a computer.

14:46.570 --> 14:49.488
What difference does it make?
Smile and collect your trophies.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.907
- You know Ana Spanikopita?
- Hello.

14:50.908 --> 14:53.743
- Aah!
- They call her the Oscar whisperer.

14:53.744 --> 14:56.537
- Ana Spanikopita. Big fan.
- Thank you, it's...

14:56.538 --> 14:59.040
I meant you are going to be
a big fan of me

14:59.041 --> 15:01.459
because I am going
to win you an Oscar.

15:01.460 --> 15:02.710
Ana is the best there is.

15:02.711 --> 15:05.963
- You better start writing your speech.
- I don't have to thank my parents, do I?

15:05.964 --> 15:08.841
You're funny.
I am literally laughing out loud.

15:08.842 --> 15:10.551
- Uh...
- We gotta get you on a talk show.

15:10.552 --> 15:13.512
You have any weird history
with Kelly Ripa I should know about?

15:13.513 --> 15:17.034
- No. Well, define "weird."
- You look doughy. Do you run?

15:17.059 --> 15:19.727
- Cardio? Anything?
- I mean, occasionally.

15:19.728 --> 15:23.273
Excuse me?
That was such a beautiful performance.

15:23.274 --> 15:25.442
- So brave.
- Thank you.

15:25.443 --> 15:27.735
Everyone here loves you.
Do you feel that?

15:27.736 --> 15:29.612
- Feel that energy!
- They don't love me.

15:29.613 --> 15:32.031
- They don't know me.
- That's why they love you.

15:32.032 --> 15:35.868
He's right. Our research shows
America likes to think they know you,

15:35.869 --> 15:38.955
and then they like learning more
about you, but at a certain point

15:38.956 --> 15:43.418
they pass a threshold where they actually
know you and then they find you weird

15:43.419 --> 15:44.627
and off-putting.

15:44.628 --> 15:47.755
Are you saying that nobody who really
knows me could ever love me?

15:47.756 --> 15:50.401
- No, no, no. Not nobody. No.
- No.

15:51.302 --> 15:53.552
What am I doing here?

15:53.553 --> 15:56.407
I don't know where you're going,
but if you could run there.

16:08.402 --> 16:12.863
Sextina, hi. Thanks for meeting me here.
I'm really excited to be working with you.

16:12.864 --> 16:16.659
Listen, chitch, if you're going
to tweet for Sextina Aquafina,

16:16.660 --> 16:19.471
you need to capture the essence
of my personal brand, okay?

16:19.497 --> 16:23.458
All upper caps, no punctuation, lots
of cryptic bullshit about the Illuminati

16:23.459 --> 16:26.043
and make sure to mention
my preferred brands, okay?

16:26.044 --> 16:32.258
Beats by Dre, Abercrombie and Fitch
and  brand fin polish.

16:32.259 --> 16:35.928
- Can you spell that last one?
- No.

16:35.929 --> 16:38.282
I gotta go get my blowhole bleached.

16:39.057 --> 16:44.079
Hey, thank you so much.
You people are the real stars. Huh?

16:49.276 --> 16:51.402
Hi. I'm Sarah Koenig.

16:51.403 --> 16:54.989
This is one ringtone told over
the course of several rings.

16:54.990 --> 16:58.826
And the story it's telling you
is to answer your phone.

16:58.827 --> 17:01.662
- Hello?
- Hey, Diane.

17:01.663 --> 17:03.223
Hey. Uh...

17:04.165 --> 17:09.086
So... How's Cordovia?

17:09.087 --> 17:11.464
It's... hard.

17:11.464 --> 17:17.595
- Do you know where the batteries are?
- What?

17:17.596 --> 17:21.992
- The batteries in the remote died.
- Did you check the junk drawer?

17:22.017 --> 17:24.060
Yeah, I looked in the junk drawer.

17:24.060 --> 17:26.270
I'm gonna take them
out of the smoke detector.

17:26.271 --> 17:29.440
- No, don't do that.
- Well, I'm out of options.

17:29.441 --> 17:34.945
Listen, I know this sounds crazy, but I
think maybe you should get back here

17:34.946 --> 17:38.824
- so you can help me find the batteries.
- Yeah?

17:38.825 --> 17:42.161
I know you're doing important work
and it's a long way to travel,

17:42.162 --> 17:45.956
but I need you here
and I think you should come home.

17:45.957 --> 17:50.794
- Is that really what you want?
- Of course it is.

17:50.795 --> 17:56.842
Well, okay, I'm looking
at this website right now

17:56.843 --> 18:01.573
and it says if I leave immediately,
I can still make it home tonight.

18:01.599 --> 18:05.226
- That sounds great.
- I love you.

18:05.227 --> 18:09.397
I love you, too, Diane.
You know, it's the funniest thing.

18:09.398 --> 18:12.316
There is a woman in this restaurant
who looks just like you.

18:12.317 --> 18:16.171
I guess I just have one of those faces.

18:18.782 --> 18:23.077
Okay, party people,
we have time for one more suggestion.

18:23.078 --> 18:25.329
- Todd.
- Did someone say movie theater?

18:25.330 --> 18:26.872
I heard movie theater.

18:26.873 --> 18:30.793
I'm Abe Lincoln and I'm gonna wear
my giant hat to the movies.

18:30.794 --> 18:34.797
Who's this sitting behind me?
John Wilkes Booth. Uh-oh.

18:34.798 --> 18:38.635
- Todd, it's me, BoJack.
- BoJack?

18:38.636 --> 18:41.720
- Todd, I'm getting you out of here.
- I can't leave.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.156
I need to take suggestions.

18:43.181 --> 18:46.684
Okay, well, here's a suggestion,
your name is Todd.

18:46.685 --> 18:53.650
You're 24, you live on my couch and
you've always seen the good in me somehow.

18:53.651 --> 18:55.443
You've been brainwashed into thinking

18:55.444 --> 18:58.237
that you belong here, but you don't.
You belong back home.

18:58.238 --> 19:01.157
If you're any kind of improviser,
you'll take that suggestion

19:01.158 --> 19:02.533
and you'll run with it.

19:02.534 --> 19:03.719
Huh.

19:04.953 --> 19:06.870
Let's get out of here.

19:06.871 --> 19:10.416
I'm afraid that getting out of here
is not an option.

19:10.417 --> 19:13.836
- You've seen too much.
- What the hell are you gonna do about it?

19:13.837 --> 19:17.256
- Stop you. With these.
- Oh, no.

19:17.257 --> 19:19.883
- Don't do anything crazy, guys.
- You can't be serious.

19:19.884 --> 19:22.303
- Just get behind me, BoJack.
- No sudden moves.

19:22.304 --> 19:25.156
Be reasonable.
You wouldn't wanna puncture the hull.

19:25.182 --> 19:28.601
Especially not when I have this
smoke bomb. Ka-pow!

19:28.602 --> 19:30.978
- I've lost them. Where did they go?
- Seriously?

19:30.979 --> 19:34.874
Now feel the wrath of my flamethrower.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.027
Too bad we're wearing sunscreen

19:38.028 --> 19:41.947
with SPF a million which protects
against flamethrowers.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.449
Oh, no.

19:43.450 --> 19:46.369
Now we finish this
with our strangle machine.

19:46.370 --> 19:47.704
Beep, boop, boop. Machine?

19:47.705 --> 19:52.082
- Strangle those guys.
- Ugh!  BoJack, help.

19:53.711 --> 19:55.836
There is literally nothing
happening to you.

19:55.837 --> 20:01.050
You don't understand, if you die
in improv, you die in real life.

20:01.051 --> 20:04.721
So stupid. Fine.
I guess I have a guard killing machine?

20:04.722 --> 20:06.406
Beep, boop, beep.

20:06.431 --> 20:09.392
No. I have a wife and children.

20:09.393 --> 20:12.019
Well, they're improvised,
but they're real to me.

20:13.980 --> 20:19.210
- Can this be the end?
- This whole ship is full of idiots.

20:19.695 --> 20:21.045
Beep, boop.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.160
Come on, come on, come on.

20:28.161 --> 20:30.538
Come on, come on, Todd.
Almost there.

20:30.539 --> 20:32.540
Wait. Where are you going?

20:32.541 --> 20:35.418
Sorry, improv is fun
and great and everything,

20:35.419 --> 20:40.256
but you guys are really into improv.
I'm gonna go with my friend.

20:40.257 --> 20:42.966
Your friend?
I didn't realize this man was your friend.

20:42.967 --> 20:46.053
Well, then, by all means,
go with him, Todd.

20:46.054 --> 20:49.908
But, see, I thought this was the man
who sabotaged your rock opera.

20:50.684 --> 20:55.104
The one who constantly abuses you and
makes you shower with a hose in the yard.

20:55.105 --> 20:56.689
I invited him to.

20:56.690 --> 21:00.443
The one who's never said a kind word
to you the entire time you've known him.

21:00.444 --> 21:05.615
- Is this your friend, Todd?
- It's more complicated than that.

21:05.616 --> 21:10.035
- Is it? We're your friends, Todd.
- More than that, we're a family.

21:10.036 --> 21:13.891
- I, uh...
- Hash browns.

21:14.792 --> 21:16.208
- What?
- I heard hash browns.

21:16.209 --> 21:19.712
- Martha, did you see my hash browns?
- Oh, my God, do you ever turn it off?

21:19.713 --> 21:24.383
It was hash browns, not pancakes.
The first morning you stayed with me.

21:24.384 --> 21:27.970
You kept making them and I kept eating
them and then I threw up in the pool.

21:27.971 --> 21:32.033
That made you throw up in the pool. Then I
got mad at you for throwing up in my pool.

21:32.058 --> 21:35.436
- But, you said, "I'll clean it up."
- And did I clean it up?

21:35.437 --> 21:38.021
No. You didn't.
I had to call the pool cleaner.

21:38.022 --> 21:39.816
- Ha, ha.
- And you said,

21:39.817 --> 21:41.358
"Thank you for letting me stay here.

21:41.359 --> 21:45.070
I don't have anywhere else to go."
And I remember when you said that,

21:45.071 --> 21:49.116
"I don't have anywhere else to go,"
because I felt good about myself.

21:49.117 --> 21:51.661
And I don't feel that way a lot.

21:51.662 --> 21:55.205
Letting you stay with me
was the best thing I ever did on purpose.

21:55.206 --> 21:58.000
I don't think I ever told you that.
But I should have.

21:58.001 --> 22:00.854
Because you're my best friend, Todd.

22:01.630 --> 22:05.842
I'm not gonna lie, if you just made all
that up, that was some really good improv.

22:05.843 --> 22:08.027
Game recognize game.

22:10.930 --> 22:14.367
- Why do you have a boat?
- Uh, I don't remember.

22:17.437 --> 22:20.981
- Hello? Prince?
- Listen, bozo, I keep getting calls

22:20.982 --> 22:23.942
from this New York playwright,
she really wants to talk to you.

22:23.943 --> 22:26.987
- She says you know her, Jill Pill?
- Jill Pill?

22:26.988 --> 22:29.948
Ring any bells?
Apparently, she worked on your TV show.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.951
- Horsin' Around?
- No, actually. The other TV show.

22:32.952 --> 22:36.205
Other TV show? Oh, shit. Jill.

22:36.206 --> 22:39.333
I'm moving into the new office
and I got Herb's ashes here.

22:39.334 --> 22:41.711
I really don't know what
to do with this thing.

22:41.712 --> 22:43.671
- Do you want it?
- Yeah.

22:45.131 --> 22:47.400
Why did I take you with me?

22:50.303 --> 22:51.929
Herb loved orphans.

22:51.930 --> 22:54.825
Mostly as a delivery apparatus
for hackneyed punchlines

22:54.850 --> 22:56.642
and mawkish sentimentality, but still.

22:56.643 --> 22:59.603
And we will do our part
to honor his legacy.

22:59.604 --> 23:01.564
- Hey, who's Jerb?
- What?

23:01.565 --> 23:04.316
Jerb Ka... Why does it say "Jerb Kazzaz?"

23:04.317 --> 23:07.820
Your e-mail said "Jerb."
I forwarded it to the plaque guy.

23:07.821 --> 23:10.489
- Is it not...?
- No, obviously that was a typo.

23:10.490 --> 23:14.201
Why would I want to dedicate the orphanage
to the memory of Jerb Kazzaz?

23:14.202 --> 23:17.496
Kind of sounds like something you'd get
at a Mediterranean restaurant,

23:17.497 --> 23:18.622
but wouldn't finish.

23:18.623 --> 23:22.209
And the waiter would say, "You want me
to box up this jerb kazzaz for you?"

23:22.210 --> 23:24.962
- And you'd say, "No."
- You gotta fix this.

23:24.963 --> 23:28.382
Really? We spent a lot of money
on this plaque, you know?

23:28.383 --> 23:30.843
- And on the t-shirts.
- Jerb's kids?

23:30.844 --> 23:33.262
No, there's no Jerb. It's Herb.

23:33.263 --> 23:36.658
T-shirt's say Jerb
so I'm going by the t-shirts.

23:38.226 --> 23:42.354
You know, Herb would probably think
that this is pretty funny

23:42.355 --> 23:46.609
- that you couldn't even get this right.
- Yeah. He would.

23:46.610 --> 23:50.738
- So, in a way...
- Yeah.

23:50.739 --> 23:52.531
You wanna get some
Mediterranean food?

23:52.532 --> 23:55.593
You read my mind.

23:58.371 --> 24:01.474
Oh, God. Lungs on fire.

24:06.838 --> 24:11.258
Ow. Crap. I hate this.
Running is terrible.

24:11.259 --> 24:13.051
Everything is the worst.

24:18.516 --> 24:20.577
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

24:22.938 --> 24:25.105
- It gets easier.
- Huh?

24:25.106 --> 24:27.542
Every day, it gets a little easier.

24:28.234 --> 24:30.736
- Yeah?
- But you gotta do it every day.

24:30.737 --> 24:34.799
That's the hard part.
But it does get easier.

24:38.286 --> 24:39.846
Okay.

25:24.916 --> 25:28.061
Boxer versus raptor.
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na.
