11:52.336 --> 11:54.547
You know what? We're gonna need
a unit out here.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.673
Trey.

11:56.799 --> 11:58.718
You in?

11:58.759 --> 11:59.927
As a Ranger?

12:03.639 --> 12:06.016
Yes, sir.

12:07.601 --> 12:09.645
All right. You can't badge up
in the next five minutes--

12:09.687 --> 12:11.230
it's gonna be a process--

12:11.272 --> 12:13.190
but what you can do
is set up a base camp here

12:13.232 --> 12:14.775
-at the ranch,
head up the search.
-Yeah.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.402
-I'll be with him on that.
-Yes, sir. Perfect.

12:16.444 --> 12:17.945
You know the terrain. Abby.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.156
Oh, I put the word out,
and they're still going.

12:20.197 --> 12:21.407
-Okay.
-Could you...

12:21.449 --> 12:22.825
Hi.

12:28.164 --> 12:30.166
She's leaving
a message for Colton.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.710
They haven't talked since...

12:32.752 --> 12:34.670
Since graduation, yeah.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.173
He's been driving through the
mountains, I think, with Geri.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.924
Geri. We got to tell Geri.

12:38.966 --> 12:40.801
AUGUST:
They don't have a signal.

12:40.843 --> 12:43.471
I think he's figuring
something out

12:43.512 --> 12:46.515
with his mom or grandma,
I don't know.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.685
Right. That...
that just happened.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.189
Hey, we'll be checking in,
all right?

12:53.230 --> 12:56.692
Augie, you got my number.
Use it.

12:56.734 --> 12:57.943
Yes, sir.

13:00.696 --> 13:01.697
(sighs) Hey, Cass.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.199
Look, I know this is a lot,

13:03.240 --> 13:04.325
especially after what happened
with Miles,

13:04.366 --> 13:05.534
but we're gonna get through it.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.744
We're gonna find him.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.829
Yeah, no other option.

13:08.871 --> 13:11.499
It does feel horribly familiar.

13:11.540 --> 13:14.752
Just the way he disappeared
so suddenly and completely,

13:14.794 --> 13:16.670
and now the not knowing.

13:16.712 --> 13:18.881
Just tell him you're happy
to see him when he's back,

13:18.923 --> 13:20.174
all right?

13:23.135 --> 13:25.471
(sighs)

13:31.644 --> 13:34.146
(Stella speaking indistinctly)

13:34.855 --> 13:38.734

a call back, okay?

14:14.019 --> 14:16.605
Hello?

14:18.065 --> 14:20.609
-Hello?
-Hey, keep in mind

14:20.651 --> 14:22.152
they sent you a note
for a reason.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.154
Knots on a string, no less.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.782
-It's quiet.
-Yes, I-I know that.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.868
Well, I'm just saying that
if you get caught

14:28.909 --> 14:30.286
you blow it.

14:30.327 --> 14:33.247
Okay, okay, I know. Be quiet.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.125
Let me think, just-just...
let me think.

14:36.166 --> 14:40.170
Another prisoner above me,
but they chose to put me here.

14:40.212 --> 14:41.964
They could've put me anywhere.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.507
You don't even know
what kind of building you're in.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.759
I mean, is this even a building?

14:45.801 --> 14:47.469
-Maybe you're on a boat.
-No, no.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.430
-I-I-I'm not on the water.
-I didn't say

14:49.471 --> 14:51.599
you were on the water.
I said maybe you're on a boat.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.017
Okay, why are we even arguing?

14:53.058 --> 14:54.518
I'm just saying
what you're thinking.

14:54.560 --> 14:56.270
-WOMAN: Shh!
-Okay, yes, I know.

14:56.312 --> 14:58.063
I need to be quiet, but
it helps me to think out loud.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.065
-You know that.
-WOMAN: Be quiet.

15:01.317 --> 15:02.610
Hello?

15:04.445 --> 15:05.446
Calling for me?

15:05.487 --> 15:06.906
Oh, hey there.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.073
Neo.

15:08.115 --> 15:09.116
It's good to, uh,

15:09.158 --> 15:10.159
it's good to see you.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.744
Gentlemen.

15:13.203 --> 15:15.789
To what do I owe the, uh...
(grunts)

15:20.711 --> 15:22.296
(stammering):
Oh, okay, yeah.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.505
I'm sorry, you're not my type.

15:23.547 --> 15:25.299
-Hey, enough!
-(grunts)

15:25.341 --> 15:28.052
You know, Neo, your friends
aren't very nice.

15:31.055 --> 15:32.598
Oh, looky there.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.266
That's what it was, huh?
(sniffs)

15:34.308 --> 15:37.394
The antiseptic.
You're, uh... bullet?

15:37.436 --> 15:38.520
Graze you?

15:38.562 --> 15:39.939
Like you don't know.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.783
Sorry I, uh... Sorry I missed.

15:50.824 --> 15:53.953
You know, I got to admit you,
uh, got pretty good reflexes.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.871
Confused, Neo. I got a shot off,

15:55.913 --> 15:58.457
yet here I am, feeling good.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.875
So help me understand that.

15:59.917 --> 16:03.295
You, uh, need a new guy?
After Fenton?

16:03.337 --> 16:05.089
Yeah?

16:07.049 --> 16:09.051
(electrical crackling)

16:10.594 --> 16:12.846
(screams)

16:12.888 --> 16:15.057
-Ask about Jenny.
-(grunts)

16:15.099 --> 16:16.517
You want me to stop,
just let me know.

16:16.558 --> 16:18.185
EMILY:
Ask him.
He's got to pick her up.

16:18.227 --> 16:19.645
He's worried about missing it,

16:19.687 --> 16:21.188
enough to bring it up
to that other guy.

16:21.230 --> 16:23.649
-She means something. Ask him.
-Who's Jenny?

16:26.568 --> 16:28.028
Don't you play dead
like a champ?

16:28.070 --> 16:29.613
Who's Jenny?

16:29.655 --> 16:31.573
Daughter? I'm guessing
she's your daughter.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.702
Yeah, I got a daughter, too,
but you knew that, didn't you?

16:34.743 --> 16:36.537
You know today
is graduation day.

16:36.578 --> 16:38.122
You're making this harder than
it has to be, you know that?

16:38.163 --> 16:40.249
Yeah, I read
the same manual, Neo.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.834
-(electrical crackling)
-(grunting)

16:44.336 --> 16:47.631
End of the day, you and me,

16:47.673 --> 16:49.550
we're dads.

16:49.591 --> 16:52.594
I bet Jenny worries about you.
My daughter's worried about me,

16:52.636 --> 16:55.931
-I could tell you that.
-Shut up.

16:55.973 --> 16:58.142
What, are we taking a break?

17:03.522 --> 17:06.025
-(electrical crackling)
-(grunts)

17:07.109 --> 17:09.319
Get him out of here.

17:13.532 --> 17:14.992
Man.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.744
That is sad, Cordell.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.662
You lost your buddy.

17:18.704 --> 17:20.205
Listen, you can make a lot

17:20.247 --> 17:22.082

Well...

about this, but...

Hey, uh, we'll be tracing

I-I do, but, um...

18:52.881 --> 18:54.716

My sister.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.267
Cassie's a cautious person?

19:03.308 --> 19:04.643
More like a, uh, survivalist.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.770
-Hmm.
-We were runners up, you know,

19:06.812 --> 19:08.230
for one of those shows.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.107
We had a dance routine.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.654
Uh, and then,

19:15.696 --> 19:17.573
everything happened with Lucas,

19:17.614 --> 19:20.242
and I probably would've stranded
Cassie on a rope bridge,

19:20.284 --> 19:21.952
and I would've missed her
like hell

19:21.994 --> 19:23.579

19:23.620 --> 19:25.747
Uh, I-I'm sorry.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.337
Cordell used to do this thing
when we were kids

19:32.379 --> 19:34.131
and my mom would
leave him in charge.

19:34.173 --> 19:36.884
He'd pretend like something
really horrible happened to him.

19:36.925 --> 19:38.927
It was stupid.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.471
He'd act like he was
really hurt, or he'd hide,

19:41.513 --> 19:44.683
you know, just anything
to scare me.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.435
I knew. I knew every time

19:46.476 --> 19:48.395
that he was messing
with me, but...

19:50.480 --> 19:53.358
...I always took it seriously

19:53.400 --> 19:54.693
because...

19:56.612 --> 19:58.989
...you never know.

20:00.532 --> 20:02.534

20:02.576 --> 20:04.620

20:07.706 --> 20:09.833
He stopped it.

20:09.875 --> 20:11.543
Cordell stopped his watch.

20:11.585 --> 20:14.630
-Huh.
-Maybe when-when they took him,
or...

20:17.216 --> 20:19.009
Maybe it's nothing.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.969
Hey. You never know.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.890

I've tried. You know that.

22:10.495 --> 22:11.830
I do.

22:13.081 --> 22:15.000
Because I asked you before.

22:17.294 --> 22:18.795
Because I blamed you.

22:20.213 --> 22:22.883
When he left to go undercover,
I blamed you.

22:22.924 --> 22:25.093
You never told me that.

22:26.636 --> 22:27.888
Well, I didn't need to.

24:44.191 --> 24:45.775
which is good.

24:46.985 --> 24:48.695
I didn't even know
he was carrying.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.947
-(scoffs)
-But I guess
most Rangers always do.

24:50.989 --> 24:52.657
Ranchers, too.

24:54.159 --> 24:56.119
They found the casing.
They found the gun.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.829
They didn't find anything else.

24:59.080 --> 25:00.999
They don't think
he's out there, do they?

25:02.209 --> 25:03.960
All they know is that
anything that they find,

25:04.002 --> 25:06.755
and I mean anything,
could be useful.

25:07.756 --> 25:10.425
-That's the truth.
-I guess.

25:13.595 --> 25:16.056
I was thinking that I should
keep their morale up, though.

25:17.265 --> 25:18.683
What are you thinking?

25:19.768 --> 25:21.269
A pancake breakfast?

25:22.812 --> 25:24.147
Nah, I don't, I don't know, man.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.607
That was...
that was probably stupid.

25:25.649 --> 25:26.650
No, no.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.276
No, it's a good idea.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.486
Pancakes.

25:29.986 --> 25:32.072
You know what?
We'll get the family involved.

25:32.113 --> 25:34.157
It's good to keep them busy,
keep their morale up.

25:34.199 --> 25:36.201
Yeah. Yeah.

25:36.243 --> 25:38.662
I'll go let them know.

25:38.703 --> 25:40.497
Thank you, Trey.
I'll see you in a bit.

No. No, they'll do
a wake-up soon.

-I can't tell.

26:14.155 --> 26:16.241
Who are you? What's your name?

26:16.283 --> 26:19.244
Listen, they want you
to be the new guy.

26:21.246 --> 26:22.747
Well, who's the old guy?

26:22.789 --> 26:25.875
You know. Fenton.

26:25.917 --> 26:27.544

26:27.586 --> 26:29.963
I'm a reporter.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.548
Is that why they have you?

26:31.590 --> 26:32.966
Yes.

26:33.008 --> 26:35.343
Why are they letting us talk?

26:35.385 --> 26:36.970
They want you to have hope.

26:37.012 --> 26:38.722
They want you to have hope
so they can take it away.

30:13.686 --> 30:15.188
(exhales sharply)

30:16.439 --> 30:19.859
You know,
when he was gone before...

30:19.901 --> 30:22.487
with the rodeo stuff,

30:22.529 --> 30:24.113
every time uncle Liam left,

30:24.155 --> 30:26.449
I used to think
he was going to I.D. Dad's body

30:26.491 --> 30:27.784
or something.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.829
Same.

30:30.870 --> 30:32.247
And the, you know,
he'd come back,

30:32.288 --> 30:33.790
and he would look sad
or worried,

30:33.832 --> 30:35.333
but he never said
anything about Dad,

30:35.375 --> 30:37.836
so I just kind of figured
it was okay, and I...

30:37.877 --> 30:39.629
I was trying
not to think about it,

30:39.671 --> 30:41.923
but I was always...

30:41.965 --> 30:43.716
I was always kind of
thinking about it.

30:43.758 --> 30:45.468
Of course you were.

30:45.510 --> 30:48.096
Uncle Liam was gonna adopt us.

30:50.765 --> 30:53.101
Which is why
I have to do something.

30:53.142 --> 30:54.352
I need to. I can...

30:54.394 --> 30:56.437
I can call people.
I can drive.

30:56.479 --> 30:58.606
-I can...

31:01.442 --> 31:02.735

31:02.777 --> 31:04.529
while all this stuff
is happening.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.406

31:06.447 --> 31:07.907
Don't you get it?

31:07.949 --> 31:09.701
It is my job now
to keep you safe.

31:09.742 --> 31:11.411

you graduated high school

31:11.452 --> 31:13.538

31:15.540 --> 31:17.500
Oh, well, then what are you
going to do, exactly?

31:17.542 --> 31:20.169
Stella, you get one helicopter
ride from Search and Rescue,

31:20.211 --> 31:21.671
and suddenly you're an expert?

31:21.713 --> 31:23.214
You're acting like Dad,
you know?

in a good way.

31:25.675 --> 31:28.678

34:21.684 --> 34:24.687
SEAN:
You're pretty good
at driving people away.

34:24.729 --> 34:26.314
Don't worry.

34:26.355 --> 34:27.982
We'll find you someone else
to keep you company.

34:29.859 --> 34:31.069
No!

34:31.819 --> 34:33.404
(gasps)

34:34.739 --> 34:36.824
(yells)

34:46.042 --> 34:48.252
Hey, thanks for making
these cookies.

34:48.294 --> 34:49.796
I know you're just trying
to distract us,

34:49.837 --> 34:51.923
but it's... it's still nice.

34:51.964 --> 34:53.841
-Saw right through me, huh?
-(chuckles)

34:53.883 --> 34:55.593
Yep.

34:55.635 --> 34:58.137
I mean, everybody wants to
make us feel better, but...

34:59.138 --> 35:00.556
...why, you know?

35:00.598 --> 35:02.934
I get when we were kids
and all, but...

35:02.975 --> 35:05.853
Stella and I have seen
some stuff. We can handle it.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.021
I know you have.

35:07.063 --> 35:09.857
You two have seen a lot.

35:09.899 --> 35:12.485
I just don't think
any of us want to test

35:12.527 --> 35:14.153
how much you can handle.

35:18.199 --> 35:20.535
(takes deep breath)

35:20.576 --> 35:23.663
You know, the smell of
these cookies reminds me of...

35:23.704 --> 35:27.208
the best and the worst after...

35:27.250 --> 35:28.835
after Mom.

35:28.876 --> 35:30.545
Did I tell you
this was her recipe?

35:31.796 --> 35:34.090
-No.
-No.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.842
Probably didn't want to
make you sad.

35:35.883 --> 35:38.803
-Yeah. (chuckles)
-And look, Augie.

35:38.845 --> 35:43.057
Me being here,
making these damn cookies,

35:43.099 --> 35:44.809
this is me coping.

35:44.851 --> 35:46.686
You know?

35:46.727 --> 35:48.729
And I wish to God
that you didn't have to find

35:48.771 --> 35:50.439
your own favorite way
to deal, but...

35:52.483 --> 35:54.735
-I know you do.
-(door opens)

35:56.028 --> 35:58.698
Aw, sad cookies.

35:58.739 --> 36:00.032
Thank you.

36:00.074 --> 36:01.701
Of course.

36:01.742 --> 36:03.369
Hey, Colt, are you tired?

36:04.662 --> 36:06.289
-No.
-I mean, I can take you
back home.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.291
You can get some sleep.

36:08.332 --> 36:11.002
Uh, nah, I think
I'm just staying here.

36:12.211 --> 36:13.754
If that's cool.

36:13.796 --> 36:15.131
Y-Yeah. Here.

36:15.173 --> 36:16.966
Yeah. No, no, no. That's cool.

You don't have to stay.

36:40.823 --> 36:42.074
I'm fine.

I know.

I know that you're fine.

36:46.329 --> 36:47.663
But I'm not.

36:47.705 --> 36:50.416
I'm just not.

36:50.458 --> 36:52.877
So, if-if it's all the same,

36:52.919 --> 36:55.504
then, um, I think
I'm gonna stay, too.

36:57.256 --> 36:58.257
Okay.

36:58.299 --> 37:00.176

-(door closes)

37:16.525 --> 37:18.027
That's fair.

37:19.779 --> 37:22.865
-Oh. Is that Walker Ranch?
-Yeah.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.617
Just tracking the course
where they grabbed him

37:24.659 --> 37:26.244
and where we found the watch.

37:26.285 --> 37:28.454
-Mm.
-There's nothing new,
but I just...

37:28.496 --> 37:30.623
I have a feeling,
you know what I mean?

37:30.665 --> 37:32.041
I do.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.251
I mean, all signs point
to the connection

37:33.292 --> 37:34.794
to Miles and Fenton.

37:34.835 --> 37:37.046
To the shootout. We know that.

37:37.088 --> 37:40.383
The thing is, they didn't come
after you or James.

37:40.424 --> 37:42.134
And they definitely
didn't come after me.

37:42.176 --> 37:44.637
They went after Walker.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.847
They knew him.
They were watching him.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.142
Right? I mean, come on.
How else,

37:50.184 --> 37:51.519
how else are they gonna know
about the...

37:51.560 --> 37:53.062
the-the race
or the graduation party?

37:53.104 --> 37:54.480
Or the fact that
there were trucks

37:54.522 --> 37:56.524
coming in and out of there?

37:56.565 --> 37:59.443
They were targeting him,
specifically.

38:00.486 --> 38:02.446
These guys were smart.

38:05.491 --> 38:06.993
And you think I'm crazy.

38:07.034 --> 38:09.036
I absolutely do not.

38:09.078 --> 38:10.663
I think you're gonna be
a great Ranger.

38:10.705 --> 38:12.748
Hmm.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.001
Meaning you can't talk to me
about the case stuff

38:15.042 --> 38:16.585
-until it's official.
-I didn't say that.

38:16.627 --> 38:17.712
Did you hear me say that?

38:20.381 --> 38:22.133
