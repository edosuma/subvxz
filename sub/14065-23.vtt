00:14.348 --> 00:16.087
What are you doing?

00:18.731 --> 00:21.491
Stanley cup.
Oldest trophy in professional sports.

00:21.531 --> 00:24.577
Denny, please do not tell me
that you've stolen the Stanley cup.

00:24.617 --> 00:26.682
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I know people.

00:26.722 --> 00:28.855
I got it for the day.

00:30.936 --> 00:32.165
And what are you doing?

00:32.206 --> 00:33.741
I'm gonna put my name on it.

00:33.781 --> 00:36.354
Every player, coach, G.M.,

00:36.354 --> 00:38.873
anybody who's won the cup
has their name on it.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.971
–But you've never won it.
–I contributed.

00:42.596 --> 00:44.348
Watch this.

00:44.348 --> 00:46.305
1970 Boston Bruins.

00:46.305 --> 00:49.640
Bobby Orr scores the winning goal!

00:49.640 --> 00:51.594
Cut to…

00:52.759 --> 00:55.501
That's him, looking for
his dad in the stands,

00:55.541 --> 00:57.525
but he's not looking
for his dad, not really.

00:57.565 --> 00:58.789
He was looking for you?

00:58.829 --> 01:01.873
I loaned him my lucky jockstrap that day.

01:01.873 --> 01:03.312
I hope you washed it first.

01:03.352 --> 01:06.043
My name belongs on this cup.

01:06.043 --> 01:08.209
Denny, I don't think
this is a good idea.

01:08.249 --> 01:11.026
They'll never notice.
It's got so many dings on it already.

01:11.066 --> 01:13.129
I'll say I dropped it on my desk.

01:13.169 --> 01:17.053
You dropped it and left a ding
in the form of your name?

01:17.950 --> 01:20.564
It's the Holy Grail, man.

01:21.665 --> 01:24.280
Denny Crane's name belongs on it.

01:24.280 --> 01:27.844
Well, engrave it later.
We need to get to the wedding.

01:35.738 --> 01:38.152
Who are the jarheads
standing with Brad?

01:38.192 --> 01:41.574
Those are his groomsmen.
They're all reservists together.

01:41.614 --> 01:44.782
Could come in handy.
Denise looks like a runner.

01:45.239 --> 01:46.667
–Hello.
–Hello.

01:46.667 --> 01:50.754
Mr Shore, Nick McClinton.
My friends call me Father.

01:50.754 --> 01:51.796
I've heard a lot about you.

01:51.836 --> 01:54.203
Yes, I've been around
with some of the nuns.

01:54.243 --> 01:55.495
So have I.

01:55.495 --> 01:58.167
Uh, listen, there's a legal matter
I'd like to discuss with you.

01:58.207 --> 01:59.769
May I phone your office next week?

01:59.809 --> 02:02.324
Little trouble with one of the sisters?

02:02.364 --> 02:04.606
We should take our seats.

02:04.833 --> 02:06.554
–Well, hello there.
–Hello.

02:06.594 --> 02:08.822
I'm, uh…
I'm Nick McClinton.

02:08.822 --> 02:11.170
You here alone?
–No, I'm with the group.

02:11.210 --> 02:12.677
I'm the designated drinker.

02:12.717 --> 02:14.082
Well, excellent.

02:14.082 --> 02:16.210
That priest is a hound dog.
I like him.

02:16.250 --> 02:19.599
Father, I think you need
to perform a ceremony.

02:19.599 --> 02:22.680
Oh, indeed.
See you at the reception.

02:23.981 --> 02:26.024
Clergy love me.

03:25.039 --> 03:29.003
I love it when the bride's knocked up.
Everybody gossips.

03:34.332 --> 03:36.906
Father, they're coming!
They're coming!

03:38.170 --> 03:40.334
Mr Shore, that matter
I wanted to discuss,

03:40.374 --> 03:42.541
it's, it's happening now!
Please, please.

03:42.581 --> 03:44.353
Come with me, please.

03:44.749 --> 03:46.140
Please, in here.

03:46.140 --> 03:49.128
FBI! Everyone,
stay where you are!

03:49.520 --> 03:50.925
Where's the priest?
–Slow down.

03:50.965 --> 03:54.716
All you've got is the word of
a few young boys against a man of God!

03:54.756 --> 03:55.527
What's going on?

03:55.567 --> 03:58.793
We have evidence that Father McClinton
is harboring illegal aliens on the premises.

03:58.833 --> 04:00.502
Where'd he go?

04:00.502 --> 04:01.305
That door.

04:01.305 --> 04:03.046
Listen, we're marines.
What can we do to help?

04:03.086 --> 04:05.767
Seal the premises.
Nobody gets in or out without my say-so.

04:05.807 --> 04:07.592
Okay, Sal, you take the front.

04:07.632 --> 04:10.544
Eddie, secure the back alley.
I'll secure the altar.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.608
Everyone, remain calm.

04:12.608 --> 04:13.903
Let's move!

04:15.614 --> 04:16.749
What a wedding!

ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2007/05/15

04:48.618 --> 04:50.734
<i>Tranquilos</i>. In here.

04:51.770 --> 04:54.026
You have about a half a minute
to tell me what's going on

04:54.066 --> 04:56.360
before those agents knock this door down.

04:56.400 --> 04:59.161
This is Maria and her son Alberto.
Maria's undocumented.

04:59.201 --> 05:02.373
Immigration caught her in a sweep
of the clothing factory where she worked,

05:02.413 --> 05:03.896
and they want to deport her
back to Mexico.

05:03.936 --> 05:05.941
How did they end up
living in your church basement?

05:05.981 --> 05:07.363
The church offered them sanctuary.

05:07.403 --> 05:08.622
Well, that's very noble,

05:08.662 --> 05:11.271
but there's no legal right
to church sanctuary in this country.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.403
Of course. But Alberto was born here.
He's a citizen.

05:13.443 --> 05:15.873
If they send his mother back,
the government effectively deports him, too,

05:15.913 --> 05:19.928
so Maria has not set foot
outside this church for, well, three months.

05:19.968 --> 05:21.520
FBI, open the door!

05:21.520 --> 05:24.116
–She's protecting her son, Mr Shore.
–I'll do what I can for Maria.

05:24.156 --> 05:26.232
As for your impending arrest,
say nothing.

05:26.272 --> 05:28.204
I'll represent you.

05:31.408 --> 05:34.874
Nicholas McClinton, you're under arrest
for harboring an illegal alien.

05:34.914 --> 05:36.317
You have the right to remain silent.

05:36.357 --> 05:38.593
He's represented by counsel.
No interrogation.

05:38.633 --> 05:40.197
Should you choose to give up that right,

05:40.237 --> 05:43.410
anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

05:43.450 --> 05:46.420
You have the right to
speak with an attorney.

05:46.949 --> 05:48.448
Has anybody checked on Denise?

05:48.488 --> 05:50.320
Brad's with her.

05:51.710 --> 05:53.868
Father, say nothing.

06:05.497 --> 06:08.032
–What did I miss?
–No time to explain.

06:08.032 --> 06:10.950
If you catch the garter,
save me a whiff.

06:12.257 --> 06:15.534
Excuse me, everyone.
I have an announcement to make.

06:15.574 --> 06:17.449
There isn't going to be a wedding today,

06:17.489 --> 06:20.827
seeing as we have no priest
and now no bride.

06:20.827 --> 06:22.250
A runner. I knew it.

06:22.250 --> 06:23.786
Brad, where is Denise?

06:23.786 --> 06:25.350
She's in labor.

06:49.916 --> 06:51.631
You're effacing.

06:51.631 --> 06:52.453
Is the baby coming?

06:52.493 --> 06:53.951
Contractions are at seven minutes.

06:53.991 --> 06:57.238
Ideally, you want them to be
5 minutes and last 60 seconds.

06:57.278 --> 06:59.889
Well, should we stay or go home?

06:59.889 --> 07:00.992
You can stay.

07:00.992 --> 07:03.384
I'd lose the gown, though.
It could get messy.

07:03.424 --> 07:04.760
–Oh, my God!
–What?

07:04.760 --> 07:06.492
–He'll be a bastard.
–What?

07:06.532 --> 07:08.175
Denise, we're not married.
He'll be illegitimate.

07:08.215 --> 07:10.198
–You've got to be kidding me.
–We can't do this.

07:10.238 --> 07:12.013
We can't do…
did you not hear what she just said?

07:12.053 --> 07:13.949
This little bastard is effacing!

07:13.989 --> 07:15.643
Is there a chaplain in the hospital?

07:15.683 --> 07:16.778
Yes, but I…

07:16.778 --> 07:17.547
Get him up here!

07:17.587 --> 07:19.374
–I don't believe this.
–Hold on a second.

07:19.414 --> 07:22.277
Get the chaplain up here now!

07:32.988 --> 07:37.050
Oh, Shirley Schmidt promised
you'd take care of this.

07:37.456 --> 07:38.641
I see.

07:38.641 --> 07:40.017
And what exactly is the problem?

07:40.057 --> 07:42.935
My landlord's evicting me.
It's so unfair!

07:42.935 --> 07:44.608
Does it have anything to do
with the duck?

07:44.648 --> 07:47.827
Oh, I get that it's a no-pets building,
but Larry is not a pet.

07:47.867 --> 07:50.885
I have an anxiety disorder,
and Larry's my emotional support animal.

07:50.925 --> 07:52.970
I'm pretty sure I have rights.

07:52.970 --> 07:55.706
You want to touch his beak?
It's really smooth.

07:55.746 --> 07:57.807
Will you excuse me?

08:03.499 --> 08:06.818
I've handled multinational corporate bankruptcies,
high-profile murder cases

08:06.858 --> 08:10.421
and defended manufacturing giants
against product liability charges.

08:10.461 --> 08:11.266
Yes?

08:11.266 --> 08:13.382
And you assign me the duck lady.

08:13.382 --> 08:15.954
Is she just sitting alone in your office?

08:15.994 --> 08:18.061
She has the duck.

08:18.061 --> 08:19.493
I can only surmise you did this

08:19.533 --> 08:22.048
'cause, one, you're hazing me
since I'm the new guy again,

08:22.088 --> 08:25.633
or two, you think my Asperger's allows
me to relate to anyone colorful.

08:25.673 --> 08:28.359
Or three, you're having
second thoughts about rehiring me.

08:28.399 --> 08:29.341
It's four.

08:29.341 --> 08:30.497
I'm name partner and

08:30.537 --> 08:35.453
don't, underscore,
have to explain myself to you.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.215
Well, that's a conversation-stopper.

08:39.255 --> 08:40.892
It's like the cops say,

08:40.892 --> 08:44.015
a case came in,
and you were catching.

08:50.443 --> 08:56.233
Docket number 830294,
United States vs Nicholas McClinton.

08:56.858 --> 08:59.003
Let's see what the hell we got here.

08:59.043 --> 09:01.663
Alan Shore for the defense.
Waive reading.

09:01.703 --> 09:04.369
The defendant pleads not guilty
and asks for an immediate trial.

09:04.409 --> 09:05.834
–No objection.
–Bail?

09:05.834 --> 09:08.493
–Defense requests ROR.
–He's a flight risk, your honor.

09:08.533 --> 09:11.006
Father McClinton's contempt
for the law is well-known.

09:11.046 --> 09:14.210
He notoriously assisted draft dodgers
during the Vietnam war.

09:14.250 --> 09:15.566
This isn't a first for him.

09:15.606 --> 09:16.530
Objection.

09:16.530 --> 09:19.707
We like to forget Vietnam
and other past mistakes in this country.

09:19.747 --> 09:21.374
It makes it easier to repeat them.

09:21.414 --> 09:22.808
What are you, anti=war?

09:22.848 --> 09:25.349
Judge, even the Republicans
are against the war now.

09:25.389 --> 09:26.522
It's the “in thing” to be.

09:26.562 --> 09:31.253
All right. The defendant is released
on his own recognizance pending trial,

09:31.293 --> 09:35.792
which I will schedule,
uh, one hour from now.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.228
What?

09:37.549 --> 09:40.446
Hey, can't we get rid of this, please?

09:40.446 --> 09:44.469
I'm sick and tired of jailing priests.
It's not original.

09:44.469 --> 09:46.755
He doesn't fiddle with the aliens, does he?

09:46.795 --> 09:48.415
Only the nuns.

09:48.605 --> 09:50.798
One hour. See you.

09:51.306 --> 09:52.514
What do you mean there's no chaplain?

09:52.554 --> 09:54.514
There is one,
but he's currently occupied.

09:54.554 --> 09:55.358
With what?

09:55.358 --> 09:56.877
Well, a respirator,
if you must know.

09:56.917 --> 09:58.715
He's presiding over
a plug-pulling ceremony.

09:58.755 --> 09:59.897
Oh, for God's sake!

09:59.937 --> 10:02.089
Oh, the cell phone.

10:03.056 --> 10:06.238
Claire, Brad Chase.
Not well.

10:06.238 --> 10:08.746
Listen, I need you to get me a priest.

10:09.632 --> 10:11.626
She's still in labor,
but we don't have much time.

10:11.666 --> 10:15.709
I need you to get me a man of God
and haul his ass down here.

10:15.709 --> 10:16.767
I am calm!

10:16.767 --> 10:19.092
And stop arguing with me
and just do as I say.

10:19.132 --> 10:23.446
My fiancée is effacing with a bastard,
so get me a frigging priest!

10:23.486 --> 10:25.414
God almighty.

10:39.749 --> 10:41.325
Oh, my goodness.

10:41.325 --> 10:42.493
Thank God.

10:42.493 --> 10:43.744
We should make this quick.

10:43.784 --> 10:45.339
Denise, we're due back in court.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.574
Simple ceremony.
We're gonna skip communion.

10:47.614 --> 10:50.611
–Smart.
–We're at 6 centimeters.

10:51.002 --> 10:54.647
–If you could just give us a second…
–I think squatting would be better.

10:54.687 --> 10:56.717
Denise, would you like the epidural?

10:56.757 --> 10:58.288
No drugs. We're going natural.

10:58.328 --> 10:59.849
You're gonna be okay, sweetie.
Keep breathing.

10:59.889 --> 11:01.457
You breathe! I want the drugs!

11:01.497 --> 11:02.509
Hello, Denise.

11:02.509 --> 11:04.154
Get out of my face!

11:04.154 --> 11:05.722
I'm on a tight schedule here.

11:05.762 --> 11:08.314
Out! Now is not the time.

11:17.475 --> 11:20.906
He's your emotional support animal?

11:20.906 --> 11:23.306
A sort of service animal,
an assistive animal.

11:23.346 --> 11:25.398
Some dogs warn you
if you have a seizure coming.

11:25.438 --> 11:28.804
Some monkeys fold your laundry
if you have no arms.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.954
Why a duck?

11:30.954 --> 11:33.171
I'm from western Massachusetts,
farm country.

11:33.211 --> 11:35.798
There were ducks.
It was nice.

11:35.798 --> 11:41.387
But here in Boston,
everything's… insistent.

11:41.387 --> 11:45.705
I'd have panic attacks.
I'd shake, sweat.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.155
It's debilitating.

11:47.155 --> 11:49.400
It's like having a heart attack
all the time.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.963
I'm familiar with the phenomenon.

11:51.003 --> 11:53.580
My doctor talked about benzodiazepines

11:53.580 --> 11:56.940
and immersion-habituation
psycho-hypnotherapy.

11:56.940 --> 11:59.769
And then he said,
“how about an animal?”

12:00.366 --> 12:03.095
A positive association that…

12:03.369 --> 12:05.162
calms me.

12:06.504 --> 12:08.099
A duck.

12:08.099 --> 12:11.383
I need this duck
like a diabetic needs insulin,

12:11.383 --> 12:14.496
like a wheelchair guy needs a wheelchair.

12:15.590 --> 12:18.197
This is a service duck.

12:28.577 --> 12:33.514
There are between 10 to 20 million
undocumented aliens living within our borders,

12:33.554 --> 12:35.144
10 to 20 million.

12:35.144 --> 12:36.909
But you invaded a church.

12:36.909 --> 12:39.730
Look, do you know the cost
of illegal immigration?

12:39.770 --> 12:44.027
One study puts it at $30 billion
per year, $30 billion.

12:44.027 --> 12:46.054
This while we're trying to fight a war,

12:46.094 --> 12:48.123
feed the homeless,
provide health coverage.

12:48.163 --> 12:52.024
Objection. He's assuming facts
that are far from in evidence.

12:52.064 --> 12:53.625
We're trying to feed the homeless?

12:53.665 --> 12:55.162
Provide health coverage?

12:55.202 --> 12:56.782
Are we also trying
to save the environment?

12:56.822 --> 12:58.417
That would be a good lie to tell,
as long as you're—

12:58.457 --> 13:00.341
Hey, you!

13:00.341 --> 13:01.921
Did you just call me “you”?

13:01.961 --> 13:04.812
This room is not your political forum.

13:04.812 --> 13:06.201
Really?

13:06.201 --> 13:07.865
Sit!

13:08.605 --> 13:10.162
What else?

13:10.880 --> 13:13.319
Our hospitals are flooded with
illegal immigrants

13:13.359 --> 13:15.603
using our ERs as doctor's offices.

13:15.603 --> 13:20.111
We currently incarcerate more than
300,000 illegals for a variety of crimes,

13:20.151 --> 13:23.175
and our states provide
more than $12 billion per year

13:23.215 --> 13:25.074
for the public education of their children.

13:25.114 --> 13:28.249
I'm confused.
Is this now his political forum?

13:28.249 --> 13:30.812
Sit down!

13:31.036 --> 13:33.020
By flouting our immigration laws,

13:33.060 --> 13:36.323
Father McClinton is
perpetuating this crisis.

13:36.323 --> 13:40.994
The young woman Father McClinton took in
has no criminal record, correct?

13:41.034 --> 13:41.653
Yes, but—

13:41.653 --> 13:43.720
–She pays her taxes on time.
–It's not about that.

13:43.760 --> 13:47.597
–She contributes time at her son's school,
volunteers at the church. –Look—

13:47.637 --> 13:53.021
So contrary to your grossly inaccurate
characterization of undocumented workers

13:53.021 --> 13:54.997
as people who run over here,
commit crimes,

13:55.037 --> 13:56.770
then demand free care at the hospital,

13:56.810 --> 13:59.178
Ms Lopez is an upstanding
member of the community.

13:59.218 --> 14:01.083
In fact, she's a model citizen, isn't she?

14:01.123 --> 14:03.798
Hey, it's your buddy that's
on trial here today, not her.

14:03.838 --> 14:07.553
Yes, for aiding a woman who
happens to be the mother of someone

14:07.593 --> 14:09.463
who is an American citizen.

14:09.463 --> 14:11.205
Let's talk about her son Alberto.

14:11.245 --> 14:13.326
You mean her anchor baby?

14:14.273 --> 14:16.005
I mean her son.

14:16.005 --> 14:17.127
It's what they do.

14:17.167 --> 14:18.830
They come over here,
and they drop babies

14:18.870 --> 14:22.807
because anybody that's born on
American soil is automatically a US citizen.

14:22.847 --> 14:25.566
It's an abuse of our 14th Amendment.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.772
Mr Shore?

14:38.241 --> 14:42.302
I'm sorry. I was just taking a moment
to allow his racism to resonate.

14:42.342 --> 14:43.278
Objection!

14:43.278 --> 14:45.877
Let's focus on one of
these anchor babies.

14:45.917 --> 14:48.613
His name is Alberto.
He's 8 years old.

14:48.613 --> 14:51.013
He takes trumpet lessons
every Wednesday.

14:51.053 --> 14:55.401
He's the leading scorer of
the Blue Tornadoes soccer team.

14:55.401 --> 14:57.296
If you deport his mother,

14:57.296 --> 15:00.142
you're forcing him to either
abdicate his rights as a citizen

15:00.182 --> 15:02.340
or fend for himself alone
on the streets of Boston.

15:02.380 --> 15:04.638
Which is the more
acceptable choice to you?

15:04.678 --> 15:06.968
He can return when he's 18
and then, as a citizen,

15:07.008 --> 15:08.904
legally sponsor his mother's move here.

15:08.944 --> 15:10.023
It's why they do it.

15:10.063 --> 15:12.247
But for those intervening ten years,

15:12.287 --> 15:15.651
if he wants to stay with his mother,
he'll have to quit his school,

15:15.691 --> 15:19.007
abandon any access
to reliable health care

15:19.007 --> 15:22.510
and put his everyday
living conditions at real risk.

15:22.510 --> 15:25.178
Ms Lopez should have thought about that
before she broke the law.

15:25.218 --> 15:28.106
And he—
–You're preventing an American citizen

15:28.146 --> 15:32.014
from using the very services you
brag about to the rest of the world.

15:32.054 --> 15:33.410
If we let everybody in,

15:33.450 --> 15:34.465
do you know what would happen
to this country?

15:34.505 --> 15:36.273
My client didn't let anyone in.

15:36.313 --> 15:38.285
He simply provided safe harbor—

15:38.325 --> 15:40.290
For a fugitive,

15:40.290 --> 15:42.602
which makes him a criminal.

15:51.324 --> 15:53.456
No, Claire, he left.
He got called back into court.

15:53.496 --> 15:54.716
Breathe, honey.

15:54.716 --> 15:56.089
This is Boston, for God's sakes!

15:56.129 --> 15:58.178
What do you mean you can't find a priest?
The place is crawling with priests.

15:58.218 --> 16:00.176
You mean to tell me you can't find one?

16:00.216 --> 16:02.067
Breathe, honey!

16:02.067 --> 16:04.287
Look, um, get a minister
if you have to,

16:04.327 --> 16:07.838
a rabbi, captain of a ship,
anybody who can perform a ceremony.

16:07.878 --> 16:08.886
You're doing great.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.659
Look, just get Shirley in
on this if you have to.

16:11.699 --> 16:13.423
There's a judge down the hall with gout.

16:13.463 --> 16:16.009
A judge can perform
a civil service, can't he?

16:16.049 --> 16:18.877
–Get that judge in here.
–Well, I can't force him to—

16:18.917 --> 16:20.063
And there it is again.

16:20.103 --> 16:23.816
Claire, yeah, change in plans.
Get over here now, fast.

16:24.288 --> 16:26.913
If she was a cripple,
I'd put some handrails in her shower.

16:26.953 --> 16:30.493
–Mr Picker—
–If she's blind, I'll label her mailbox with the bumps.

16:30.533 --> 16:31.820
She's not, okay.

16:31.820 --> 16:35.256
The fair housing act prohibits
discrimination on the basis of disability.

16:35.296 --> 16:37.691
This includes a mental impairment,

16:37.691 --> 16:39.579
which limits an individual's
ability to function

16:39.619 --> 16:42.133
as does Ms Lovejoy's anxiety disorder.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.856
No pets.

16:44.551 --> 16:46.634
Okay, that was weird.

16:46.634 --> 16:48.038
Who's the duck hurting?

16:48.078 --> 16:50.602
He waddles around,
smelling up the place,

16:50.642 --> 16:51.987
quacking at people!

16:51.987 --> 16:54.957
He's a good duck.
He doesn't quack at people.

16:55.621 --> 16:58.217
If there's been any damage,
Ms Lovejoy's security deposit—

16:58.257 --> 17:01.191
Won't cover my ass if he bites
someone on my property.

17:01.231 --> 17:04.329
Then I'll really get drilled,
and they can be vicious.

17:04.368 --> 17:06.892
You're talking about swans.

17:08.183 --> 17:11.550
These animals decrease blood pressure,
alleviate depression—

17:11.589 --> 17:13.202
You know what eases my depression?

17:13.242 --> 17:15.127
Watching a stripper clean my gutters.

17:15.167 --> 17:16.614
Do I make people live with that?

17:16.654 --> 17:20.148
Now you're making fun,
and I don't like it!

17:20.148 --> 17:23.002
People like you are why we've
become a nation of coddlers.

17:23.042 --> 17:27.489
Yeah, making excuses for being
weak and having no discipline.

17:27.721 --> 17:28.955
What are you, a cat?

17:28.995 --> 17:31.463
The accommodation isn't reasonable.

17:31.463 --> 17:34.080
She's not handicapped,
and he ain't medicine.

17:34.120 --> 17:36.223
Fight me in court.
Think I can't take it?

17:36.263 --> 17:38.238
I'm a landlord.
–I can't afford to move.

17:38.278 --> 17:40.567
Two months in advance,
moving costs.

17:40.607 --> 17:42.349
He'll probably keep my deposit.

17:42.389 --> 17:45.447
I'll have an eviction on my record!
Oh, God! Oh, God!

17:45.487 --> 17:47.032
Can you shut him up?

17:47.032 --> 17:47.903
There it is.

17:47.903 --> 17:49.350
Mr Crane!

17:51.683 --> 17:53.514
Blanks. Just kidding.

17:53.514 --> 17:55.889
What, can't take a joke?

18:11.870 --> 18:13.739
They've offered Maria a deal.

18:13.779 --> 18:19.170
They're giving her a green card
in exchange for her testimony against you.

18:19.170 --> 18:21.145
Obviously, they're making
an example of you.

18:21.185 --> 18:22.639
Great.

18:23.138 --> 18:24.367
I can try to talk to her.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.609
No, no, no, no.

18:25.609 --> 18:27.673
If she has the opportunity
to stay here with Alberto,

18:27.713 --> 18:31.541
she should take it.
I've actually discussed that with her.

18:31.635 --> 18:34.114
That could turn out to be
quite a sacrifice on your part.

18:34.154 --> 18:36.676
They're seeking jail time.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.592
You know what I like to do
when things seem hopeless?

18:40.632 --> 18:41.574
Pray?

18:41.574 --> 18:44.587
Bribe. What do we know
about this judge?

18:44.587 --> 18:46.447
Bribery isn't an option.

18:46.447 --> 18:49.323
So let's pray then and fight.

18:49.323 --> 18:52.117
You a fighter, Alan?
–I like it better than praying.

18:52.157 --> 18:54.973
Well, come on then.
This is Boston.

18:58.681 --> 18:59.446
Hold on, honey!

18:59.486 --> 19:01.185
Stop telling me to hold on!

19:01.225 --> 19:03.417
What the hell is going on in here?

19:03.457 --> 19:05.189
Well, I told you.
She's having a baby,

19:05.229 --> 19:07.728
and you have to perform
the marriage ceremony before she does.

19:07.768 --> 19:10.921
This is Brad Chase, the groom,
Denise Bauer, the bride.

19:10.961 --> 19:12.497
And who's that in her vagina?

19:12.537 --> 19:14.698
That would be the doctor.

19:14.698 --> 19:16.643
Oh, she's awfully close.

19:17.763 --> 19:19.068
Okay, let's go.

19:25.294 --> 19:28.311
Ducks quacking,
lawyers shooting shotguns,

19:28.311 --> 19:30.498
this place is an asylum,
don't you think?

19:30.538 --> 19:32.314
And what's with all the hopping?

19:32.354 --> 19:33.780
I think I have a solution.

19:33.820 --> 19:35.820
If it's duck <i>à l' orange</i>,
count me in.

19:35.860 --> 19:39.200
I'll personally be financially
liable for any damages.

19:39.240 --> 19:41.994
And further, the duck
will agree to wear a diaper.

19:42.034 --> 19:44.398
I mean, Ms Lovejoy will agree
that he'll wear one.

19:44.438 --> 19:47.451
Oh, right, so that
the guy in 4B can tell me

19:47.451 --> 19:52.487
that he gets to keep a therapeutic
Vietnamese pig who helps him stutter less.

19:52.527 --> 19:54.460
Sorry. Duck lady is history.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.681
Mr Picker, please sit.

20:01.688 --> 20:02.766
I don't like you.

20:02.806 --> 20:05.257
What are you gonna do,
purr at me again?

20:05.297 --> 20:07.969
I am not going to purr.

20:11.620 --> 20:14.239
It seems I was wrong about that.

20:14.955 --> 20:17.265
See, while you were so kind
as to come in today,

20:17.305 --> 20:19.450
I took the liberty of
dispatching a paralegal,

20:19.490 --> 20:22.118
first to the executive office
of public safety

20:22.158 --> 20:24.955
and then to several of your properties.

20:24.955 --> 20:28.119
I wanted to be prepared
should things not work out.

20:28.159 --> 20:29.909
I'm prepared, Mr Picker.

20:29.909 --> 20:31.477
What are you talking about?

20:31.517 --> 20:36.389
I'm talking about the fire protection
system code 780, CMR 901.6.

20:36.389 --> 20:38.702
Evidently, you neglected
to have signage on equipment

20:38.742 --> 20:41.887
and sprinkler control valves of
the prescribed size and in contrasting colors.

20:41.927 --> 20:44.397
Addressing that,
a hassle, I know.

20:44.397 --> 20:46.247
You have a fence erected without a permit

20:46.287 --> 20:49.632
that exceeds the height allowed for erection
without a permit by an inch and a half.

20:49.672 --> 20:51.641
That will be fines, fees and a hassle.

20:51.681 --> 20:54.550
Noncompliance with
low-flush toilet mandates. Ouch.

20:54.590 --> 20:56.767
And let's not overlook the pruning
of a protected tree

20:56.807 --> 20:58.644
without the permission of the tree warden.

20:58.684 --> 20:59.772
Oh, here's a biggie.

20:59.812 --> 21:02.130
The penalty for use of
undocumented workers.

21:02.170 --> 21:04.948
Are we a little sloppy about
our employment records?

21:04.988 --> 21:06.317
This is blackmail!

21:06.317 --> 21:07.743
Maybe you should call the cops.

21:07.783 --> 21:10.063
I'm done purring, Picker.
The claws are coming out.

21:10.103 --> 21:13.828
You want to screw with me?
Go ahead, make my bed.

21:14.776 --> 21:16.719
Day.

21:24.065 --> 21:25.888
–Do you, Dennis—
–No, it's Denise!

21:25.928 --> 21:27.753
When's the last time
you saw a Dennis giving birth?

21:27.793 --> 21:29.763
Stop rushing me, you rusher!

21:29.763 --> 21:30.881
The head is crowning.

21:30.921 --> 21:36.220
–Hurry!
–Do you, Denise, take Brad to be your husband?

21:36.220 --> 21:37.563
–Hurry!
–Well done! Here he comes!

21:37.603 --> 21:38.395
Hey, you're not gonna make it!

21:38.435 --> 21:41.308
–Do you, Brad, take Denise to be your—
–I do.

21:41.348 --> 21:43.731
–By the power vested—
–Just say it!

21:43.731 --> 21:46.626
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

21:46.666 --> 21:48.661
Okay, we're married.

21:50.078 --> 21:51.935
–The head is coming!
–Oh, my God!

21:51.975 --> 21:54.182
What the hell is happening down there?

21:54.222 --> 21:56.382
Here he is, here he is!

21:56.382 --> 21:58.072
He's here.

21:58.337 --> 22:00.942
Oh, he is a beautiful baby.

22:00.942 --> 22:02.469
Girl.

22:02.469 --> 22:04.783
It's all pinched up and messy.

22:04.783 --> 22:06.729
We have a girl.
We have a baby girl.

22:06.769 --> 22:08.501
It isn't cute at all.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.964
–Is she healthy?
–Oh, she's perfect.

22:10.964 --> 22:13.610
I thought they always came out cute.

22:13.610 --> 22:15.881
Oh, God. It's a girl.

22:15.881 --> 22:17.897
–Do you want to cut the cord?
–Okay.

22:17.937 --> 22:21.511
You don't circumcise girls!

22:21.511 --> 22:23.332
–Um, judge.
–Yes?

22:23.332 --> 22:25.068
Let's, let's get you back
to your room.

22:25.108 --> 22:28.237
Did it look cute to you?
I don't…

22:31.680 --> 22:34.539
Did you ever pursue the idea of
entering the United States legally?

22:34.579 --> 22:35.480
Yes.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.909
But it would have taken a long time,
and the chances are very—

22:37.949 --> 22:40.763
So you wanted to skip the line
and take the fast track.

22:40.803 --> 22:42.897
And when you were caught
breaking the law,

22:42.937 --> 22:44.725
the defendant helped you?

22:44.725 --> 22:45.637
Yes.

22:45.637 --> 22:48.643
Who's idea was it to seek
sanctuary in the church?

22:48.683 --> 22:50.302
Father McClinton's.

22:50.302 --> 22:54.847
He said the church could provide protection
while we find another way for me to stay.

22:54.887 --> 22:58.476
Ms Lopez, why did you come
to the United States?

22:58.476 --> 23:00.189
There is no work in Mexico.

23:00.229 --> 23:04.852
My brothers have to travel far
to find jobs, construction, farming.

23:04.852 --> 23:07.545
It is very hard on them,
and they earn nothing.

23:07.585 --> 23:11.493
$13 each day, it's not enough
for my family to eat.

23:11.493 --> 23:14.481
So you broke the law
and snuck into our country?

23:14.521 --> 23:15.427
Yes.

23:15.427 --> 23:17.922
And now that you've been discovered,
you're being deported?

23:17.962 --> 23:20.084
No, I'm not going back.

23:20.084 --> 23:22.417
Is it true you made a deal
with the prosecutor

23:22.457 --> 23:24.490
that you got a green card
in exchange for your testimony?

23:24.530 --> 23:25.692
Objection. Relevance.

23:25.732 --> 23:27.036
It's perfectly relevant.

23:27.076 --> 23:30.780
Your entire case against Father McClinton
is based on the contention

23:30.820 --> 23:34.120
that illegal aliens such as Ms Lopez
are a parasite on our society.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.983
Yet when it suits
the government's purposes—

23:36.023 --> 23:38.919
We reserve the right to grant deals
to any witness we deem fit.

23:38.959 --> 23:43.346
This is just how our immigration
laws are applied in general.

23:43.346 --> 23:46.372
When it suits the government,
they look the other way.

23:46.412 --> 23:49.818
But when they want to make a point,
they tear innocent families apart

23:49.858 --> 23:51.968
and put a priest's head
on the chopping block.

23:52.008 --> 23:53.913
Mr Shore!

23:54.214 --> 23:57.495
Ms Lopez, why did you go
to Father McClinton?

23:57.495 --> 23:58.842
He's a good man.

23:58.842 --> 24:01.610
He helps everyone without
thinking about himself,

24:01.650 --> 24:05.295
and I thought maybe he could help me.

24:05.295 --> 24:06.819
And he did?

24:06.819 --> 24:08.416
Yes.

24:08.757 --> 24:10.626
I'm so sorry, Father.

24:10.626 --> 24:13.847
I wouldn't do this
if I didn't have to.

24:23.187 --> 24:26.572
This is the most beautiful girl
I've ever seen.

24:30.300 --> 24:32.345
Here you go, mom.

24:33.550 --> 24:34.572
Hi.

24:34.572 --> 24:36.777
Oh, look at her.

24:36.777 --> 24:39.072
Look at her, she's…

24:39.836 --> 24:43.812
Does she look just a little bit
like Jeffrey Coho to you?

24:43.812 --> 24:45.257
I'm kidding.

24:45.257 --> 24:48.153
–I love you.
–I love you.

24:48.153 --> 24:49.728
Look what we made.

24:49.728 --> 24:53.294
Hi. Hi, precious.

25:03.361 --> 25:05.032
This woman had a child.

25:05.032 --> 25:07.697
They faced a life of certain poverty
if she were deported,

25:07.737 --> 25:09.270
perhaps they might have starved.

25:09.310 --> 25:12.537
A priest has to act with mercy
when everyone else refuses to.

25:12.577 --> 25:17.011
But surely, Father,
you can appreciate if every church
started harboring illegal immigrants…

25:17.051 --> 25:18.654
Yes, yes, the big picture.

25:18.694 --> 25:20.143
Well, I couldn't look
at the big picture here.

25:20.183 --> 25:24.836
I was looking at one mother and her child
facing an unspeakable hardship.

25:24.876 --> 25:27.498
So it's your belief that priests
should get to break the law

25:27.538 --> 25:29.129
so long as they're being compassionate?

25:29.169 --> 25:31.086
I didn't state it in such simple terms.

25:31.126 --> 25:33.035
But it is that simple.
You harbored a fugitive

25:33.075 --> 25:35.232
because you felt badly for that fugitive.

25:35.272 --> 25:37.455
When's the last time
you starved, Mr Sciarra?

25:37.495 --> 25:39.262
There are many Americans
that are starving.

25:39.302 --> 25:41.893
And I do a lot to help those people,
as well. Does the government?

25:41.933 --> 25:43.707
If you don't mind,
I'll ask the questions.

25:43.747 --> 25:46.215
Yes, it's easy to ask the questions.
Have you got any answers?

25:46.255 --> 25:48.190
Well, one answer might be
“obey the law.”

25:48.230 --> 25:50.641
We can't even decide what the law
should be on this issue, and so I—

25:50.681 --> 25:53.680
It's clear on harboring fugitives.
What you did was illegal.

25:53.720 --> 25:55.535
That puts you in the company
of criminals, Father.

25:55.575 --> 25:57.933
Along with Martin Luther King
and other people of conscience.

25:57.973 --> 26:00.047
Oh, oh, you liken yourself
to reverend King, do you?

26:00.087 --> 26:02.995
Certainly not.
He wasn't Catholic.

26:09.615 --> 26:11.253
Jerry, I'm very impressed.

26:11.293 --> 26:13.871
You got a satisfactory result,
avoiding court,

26:13.911 --> 26:17.150
which, given the client's anxiety,
was essential.

26:17.150 --> 26:19.246
Excellent, excellent work.

26:19.246 --> 26:20.670
Thank you, Shirl.

26:20.670 --> 26:22.600
It felt good.

26:22.600 --> 26:24.794
Please, call me Shirley.

26:24.794 --> 26:27.513
Don't ever call me “Shirl.”

26:32.109 --> 26:33.315
What?

26:33.315 --> 26:34.741
–He's not breathing!
–What?

26:34.781 --> 26:36.376
–Do you know CPR?
–No, I don't…

26:36.416 --> 26:38.103
He's not breathing!
Help him!

26:38.143 --> 26:39.958
–Do you know CPR?
–It's a duck.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.912
–Help him! He's gonna die!
–I'm not about to—

26:41.952 --> 26:43.926
Shirley, if you know CPR…

26:43.926 --> 26:46.198
He's not breathing!
–It's a duck!

26:46.198 --> 26:48.511
What's wrong with you?
He's dying!

26:48.511 --> 26:50.780
Oh, for God's sake!

26:51.952 --> 26:54.141
It's, it's cold.

26:54.141 --> 26:55.856
It's dead.

26:55.856 --> 26:57.685
No!

26:57.685 --> 27:01.575
Oh, Larry! Larry!

27:03.106 --> 27:05.942
–What the…
–Dead duck.

27:11.474 --> 27:13.615
A burglar robs your house.

27:13.615 --> 27:16.103
His friend hides him from the police.

27:16.103 --> 27:18.288
They should both go to jail,
shouldn't they?

27:18.328 --> 27:20.672
That's exactly what happened here,

27:20.672 --> 27:22.729
only on a much larger scale.

27:22.729 --> 27:25.228
Our country is quickly
being robbed of its resources

27:25.268 --> 27:28.014
by those who illegally
infiltrate our borders.

27:28.054 --> 27:30.798
Welfare, public education,

27:30.798 --> 27:33.323
our prison system, American medicine,

27:33.323 --> 27:36.689
all are being drained by
the influx of illegal aliens.

27:36.729 --> 27:39.217
And remember,
under federal law,

27:39.217 --> 27:43.028
hospitals are required to treat anyone
who comes in with an emergency,

27:43.068 --> 27:47.257
whether or not they're insured,
documented or able to pay.

27:47.257 --> 27:51.870
In California alone,
84 hospitals are closing their doors

27:51.870 --> 27:54.064
because of the rising number
of illegal immigrants

27:54.104 --> 27:57.612
and their non-reimbursed tax
on our system.

27:57.612 --> 27:59.889
We are nearing the breaking point.

27:59.889 --> 28:02.491
This isn't about being heartless.

28:02.491 --> 28:05.568
It's about having to face
a crippling problem.

28:05.568 --> 28:07.364
It would be nice to help everybody,

28:07.404 --> 28:10.702
but we just can't do it anymore.

28:10.702 --> 28:13.182
And it's not compassionate to do it.

28:13.182 --> 28:14.609
Don't be fooled.

28:14.609 --> 28:18.637
Father McClinton is not
sparing suffering.

28:18.637 --> 28:21.452
He is simply transferring it,

28:21.452 --> 28:23.912
reallocating it to Americans,

28:23.912 --> 28:28.917
to you and me,
to our children.

28:28.917 --> 28:30.725
He is committing a crime,

28:30.725 --> 28:33.488
and he needs to be held accountable.

28:34.869 --> 28:37.504
Even if he is a priest.

28:53.701 --> 28:58.692
In 1903, my great-grandfather
came here from Scotland.

28:58.692 --> 29:01.051
He was 16 years old.

29:01.051 --> 29:03.814
I remember when I was about 7,

29:03.814 --> 29:10.578
him telling me that he had sailed
across the ocean to find his fortune.

29:10.578 --> 29:13.479
It was the happiest day
of his life, he said,

29:13.519 --> 29:18.172
the day he arrived here
in the United States of America.

29:18.172 --> 29:20.783
Our nation is so different today.

29:20.783 --> 29:22.852
It's crowded, too much traffic,

29:22.852 --> 29:25.887
not enough housing,
not enough jobs, not enough care.

29:25.927 --> 29:28.002
We're overcome.

29:28.002 --> 29:32.752
And recently, our sense of
national pride has shifted

29:32.752 --> 29:37.769
to a nationalistic institutionalized
paranoia and suspicion of foreigners.

29:37.769 --> 29:39.125
And within that shift,

29:39.165 --> 29:41.489
there's been an erosion
of our civil rights,

29:41.529 --> 29:44.468
our democracy has often
given way to autocracy,

29:44.508 --> 29:48.350
and we've systematically alienated
much of the rest of the world.

29:48.390 --> 29:52.989
But of all the ways
that America has lost sight

29:52.989 --> 29:57.556
of what it means to be America…
immigration…

29:57.556 --> 30:02.847
It's not just a part of
our heritage or landscape,

30:02.847 --> 30:05.824
it's how we were born as a country

30:05.824 --> 30:09.532
and then became the American dream.

30:09.748 --> 30:13.933
Understandably, we can't just
keep letting everybody in.

30:13.933 --> 30:18.953
We've got security issues,
limited resources and at some point…

30:20.647 --> 30:24.321
But what to do with those
who are already here

30:24.321 --> 30:26.216
and have been here for years

30:26.216 --> 30:29.989
as part of our communities,
our workforce, our families?

30:29.989 --> 30:34.444
Do we just throw them out
for being undocumented?

30:34.444 --> 30:37.066
Because as a nation,
we've cultivated them,

30:37.106 --> 30:38.794
wooed them to be here.

30:38.794 --> 30:41.453
And what exactly do we mean
by “undocumented”?

30:41.493 --> 30:44.049
Many of these people have documents
spilling out of their pockets.

30:44.089 --> 30:45.662
They file tax returns.

30:45.662 --> 30:48.847
They're issued driver's
licenses, library cards.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.675
The government actually paves the way

30:50.715 --> 30:52.613
for illegal immigrants
to open bank accounts here.

30:52.653 --> 30:56.481
Bank of America and Citigroup
offer them loans and mortgages.

30:56.521 --> 30:59.754
Wellpoint, the nation's largest
healthcare provider,

30:59.794 --> 31:01.104
sells insurance to them,

31:01.144 --> 31:03.952
while Sprint and Verizon
offer them cell phone contracts.

31:03.992 --> 31:06.493
Contrary to the popular myth

31:06.493 --> 31:09.523
that undocumented workers
are a drain on our economy,

31:09.563 --> 31:11.472
they are in truth, vital to it.

31:11.512 --> 31:14.430
That's why this issue is so complicated.

31:14.430 --> 31:16.804
In a very significant way,

31:16.804 --> 31:19.860
either you or a family member
or a friend,

31:19.860 --> 31:21.714
we all have at least one,

31:21.714 --> 31:25.240
if not many, undocumented immigrants
living in our lives.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.653
And if we just start whisking them away,

31:27.693 --> 31:30.949
every one of us will lose
people we care about, rely on,

31:30.989 --> 31:32.642
people we love.

31:32.642 --> 31:35.950
But with perhaps as many as 20 million

31:35.950 --> 31:38.944
undocumented immigrants
living in this country,

31:38.984 --> 31:43.113
do not think for a second this doesn't
affect you on a very personal level,

31:43.153 --> 31:44.557
as it affected my client.

31:44.597 --> 31:47.466
Father McClinton reached out
to help somebody he cared about,

31:47.506 --> 31:51.851
one of his parishioners who needed a bed
for her and her 8-year-old son to sleep on.

31:51.891 --> 31:53.338
Does that make him a criminal?

31:53.378 --> 31:55.123
The fact that we're in this courtroom

31:55.163 --> 31:58.411
to discuss anything other than what's
to be done for this woman and her child,

31:58.451 --> 32:01.132
the fact that we're here instead
to punish this priest,

32:01.172 --> 32:03.575
that's what's criminal.

32:04.192 --> 32:08.961
We can no longer be the land of dreams
to the rest of the world.

32:08.961 --> 32:13.537
But when I think of the look
in my great-grandfather's eyes

32:13.537 --> 32:18.052
as he would talk about how truly
blessed he felt to be an American,

32:18.052 --> 32:21.376
to be in a nation that prided itself

32:21.376 --> 32:25.127
on its compassion, its freedom,
its true sense of fairness,

32:25.167 --> 32:29.410
when I think about that,
I think how lucky we are

32:29.410 --> 32:34.790
that there are times when we
still get to believe that.

32:34.790 --> 32:36.726
Please, go back to that room

32:36.726 --> 32:40.689
and declare this day
to be one of those times.

33:11.612 --> 33:13.077
Denny Crane.

33:13.756 --> 33:15.176
Denny Crane bobblehead.

33:15.216 --> 33:16.639
Famous Boston icons.

33:16.639 --> 33:20.800
Ted Williams, Bobby Orr,
Larry Bird and me.

33:20.800 --> 33:23.463
The vet said the duck died
of an apparent coronary,

33:23.503 --> 33:27.769
most likely brought on by you blasting
a shotgun in its direction.

33:27.809 --> 33:32.542
Denny, for you to fire off
a shotgun in an office space,

33:32.542 --> 33:34.993
loaded or not…

33:35.841 --> 33:39.870
Last week you dropped your trousers
in a judge's chambers.

33:39.870 --> 33:43.162
It's getting old, Denny,
and it's getting embarrassing.

33:43.202 --> 33:44.917
Not to me.

33:53.639 --> 33:57.131
This behavior will not
be tolerated much longer.

33:57.131 --> 34:01.118
I don't mean by the other partners,
Denny. I mean by me.

34:01.118 --> 34:02.749
I will fire you.

34:02.749 --> 34:05.498
I won't want to,
but I will damn well do it.

34:05.538 --> 34:08.196
This is a warning.

34:13.456 --> 34:15.774
Could you tell me why?

34:15.774 --> 34:20.768
What would possess you
to get a shotgun?

34:25.252 --> 34:28.692
Shirley, there was a time
when there was a line at my door.

34:28.732 --> 34:31.705
People wanted me on their case.

34:33.350 --> 34:36.333
Now nobody wants me on their case.

34:40.388 --> 34:43.618
Brad and Denise had a little baby girl.
Did you hear?

34:43.658 --> 34:45.654
–I did.
–Fantastic.

34:45.654 --> 34:49.027
You look around.
Brad, Denise, Claire, Alan,

34:49.027 --> 34:53.161
it's all still in front of them, really.

34:53.161 --> 34:55.119
It's not in front of us
anymore, Shirley.

34:55.159 --> 34:59.087
It's almost over.
We're old.

34:59.087 --> 35:02.562
You can feel however you want
about yourself,

35:02.562 --> 35:04.917
and I'll choose how to feel about me.

35:04.957 --> 35:06.506
Shirley…

35:07.405 --> 35:11.658
you're a beautiful woman,
smart, still relevant, really.

35:11.658 --> 35:13.496
But you're old.

35:13.496 --> 35:15.975
You're closing in on the end.

35:15.975 --> 35:19.288
Not as fast as I am, but…

35:19.288 --> 35:22.414
eh, we're rich. We certainly don't
need to work, but we do so,

35:22.454 --> 35:24.485
not only because we love it,

35:24.485 --> 35:27.790
but because we're desperate
for distraction,

35:27.790 --> 35:31.141
like running around
shooting a shotgun.

35:31.141 --> 35:37.893
It can be more fun than sitting
in your office acting your age.

35:48.294 --> 35:51.214
Will the defendant please rise?

35:51.419 --> 35:54.849
Mr Foreman, has the jury
reached a unanimous verdict?

35:54.889 --> 35:55.939
We have, your honor.

35:55.979 --> 35:57.641
What say you?

35:58.430 --> 36:00.954
“On the count of harboring
an illegal alien,”

36:00.994 --> 36:04.699
“we find the defendant
Nicholas McClinton”

36:04.699 --> 36:05.757
“guilty.”

36:05.757 --> 36:08.178
Ask your honor to enter a judgment
notwithstanding the verdict.

36:08.218 --> 36:11.445
Denied.
ROR is granted until sentencing.

36:11.445 --> 36:13.127
–We will appeal this.
–Thank you.

36:13.167 --> 36:14.523
Please don't worry.

36:14.523 --> 36:16.103
That's the beauty of my job.

36:16.143 --> 36:18.064
I can do it anywhere.

36:39.445 --> 36:43.309
We're going to have another ceremony
as soon as Denise is feeling up to it, so…

36:43.349 --> 36:45.102
But you are officially married?

36:45.142 --> 36:47.460
Mr and Mrs Brad Chase.

36:48.052 --> 36:49.458
What's your daughter's name, Brad?

36:49.498 --> 36:51.280
–Bradley.
–Okay.

36:51.280 --> 36:53.056
A beautiful thing, having a baby.

36:53.096 --> 36:54.784
Think you got any eggs left, Shirl?

36:54.824 --> 36:58.255
Spit one out for old time's sake.
That'd be a hoot.

36:58.255 --> 37:00.365
Talk about your miracles.

37:00.812 --> 37:04.487
I was just making cocktail conversation.
I apologize.

37:04.487 --> 37:06.569
Hey! Oh, hey.

37:06.569 --> 37:08.337
A special cigar.

37:08.337 --> 37:10.099
I was saving it for your first son.

37:10.139 --> 37:12.093
But what the hell?
A daughter's not so bad.

37:12.133 --> 37:13.622
This isn't China.
–Thanks, Denny.

37:13.662 --> 37:15.569
Straight from Cuba.

37:15.569 --> 37:18.180
As legal as my gardener.

37:22.935 --> 37:26.221
Is that a cigar or what?
Denny Crane.

37:37.624 --> 37:39.016
Quiet tonight.

37:39.016 --> 37:41.071
Well, I lost.

37:41.349 --> 37:43.465
I don't like to lose.

37:44.245 --> 37:48.029
Well, I sympathized with the priest.

37:51.448 --> 37:53.805
But this immigration mess,
you know, it's…

37:53.845 --> 37:54.808
A mess.

37:54.808 --> 37:56.852
At any given moment in my house,

37:56.892 --> 38:00.863
I've got a cook and a maid
and a gardner and a car detailer

38:00.863 --> 38:03.723
and a pool man and a handyman
and a hooker,

38:03.723 --> 38:05.628
and I'd be the only one
that's documented,

38:05.668 --> 38:08.296
except maybe the hooker.

38:10.770 --> 38:14.672
You typically have an answer
for our most difficult problems, Denny.

38:14.712 --> 38:17.658
What's the Tom DeLay
part of you say about this?

38:17.698 --> 38:19.760
Ship them off to Iraq,
let them fight our war,

38:19.800 --> 38:21.289
and after, don't let them back in.

38:21.329 --> 38:22.863
Dig deeper.

38:23.173 --> 38:25.643
Medical research.
Test new drugs on them.

38:25.683 --> 38:27.685
What's your Dick Cheney say?

38:27.685 --> 38:30.446
–Shoot them.
–Problem solved.

38:31.863 --> 38:35.413
Shirley threatened to fire me today.

38:35.413 --> 38:37.705
–For what?
–I killed a duck.

38:37.705 --> 38:40.526
Accident.
It had a heart attack.

38:40.526 --> 38:42.234
Shirley was fond of the duck?

38:42.274 --> 38:44.302
I'm assuming.

38:45.211 --> 38:47.573
She's in denial.
–About the duck?

38:47.573 --> 38:49.730
About getting old.

38:50.827 --> 38:53.727
How is it the youth rule this country?

38:53.727 --> 38:55.615
I don't get it.
The old have all the money.

38:55.655 --> 39:01.001
Yes, but don't you think the real joy in life
lies in the promise of tomorrow?

39:01.001 --> 39:05.504
The young simply have more tomorrows
stacked up. That's all.

39:05.504 --> 39:07.784
Happiness…

39:08.255 --> 39:10.022
is right now, my friend.

39:10.022 --> 39:12.160
On this balcony, right now,
you and me.

39:12.200 --> 39:15.748
I love how you reduce
everything in life to…

39:15.748 --> 39:17.563
You and me.

39:22.772 --> 39:24.298
Alan…

39:24.665 --> 39:27.135
let's drink from the cup.

39:27.135 --> 39:29.422
That's gonna be a lot of scotch.

39:29.683 --> 39:31.972
It's the Holy Grail, man.

39:32.894 --> 39:35.852
Gordie Howe drank from this cup.

39:37.247 --> 39:40.595
Rocket Richard, Basil Pocklington.

39:40.595 --> 39:42.739
Here you go.

39:45.974 --> 39:48.749
Scotch actually breathes
rather well in trophies.

39:48.789 --> 39:53.756
Now we can say we drank
from Lord Stanley's cup.

39:56.133 --> 39:58.155
What a thing to be able
to tell our grandchildren.

39:58.195 --> 39:59.965
–Go get a camera.
–Denny, careful.

40:00.005 --> 40:02.975
No, no, don't worry.
Get a camera, and we'll—

40:05.328 --> 40:08.385
That will leave a significant ding.

40:10.979 --> 40:15.005
Killed a duck, dropped the grail,
all in the same day.

40:16.045 --> 40:18.592
