00:08.134 --> 00:09.885
<i>Previously on</i> Agent Carter...

00:09.969 --> 00:11.053
<i>A woman from your lab died,</i>

00:11.137 --> 00:12.930
and two of my men were killed
to hide the evidence.

00:13.055 --> 00:14.181
I had nothing to do with that.

00:14.432 --> 00:15.808
<i>Best way to explain is to show you.</i>

00:16.142 --> 00:18.978
<i>Only one thing was left behind,
Zero Matter.</i>

00:19.270 --> 00:21.605
Tonight, we'll clear out the laboratory.

00:23.399 --> 00:24.525
<i>We need to
get to your lab to retrieve</i>

00:24.608 --> 00:26.152
<i>the research and the Zero Matter.</i>

00:26.444 --> 00:27.987
- Whitney Frost?
- Now hand it over.

00:35.453 --> 00:37.455
<i>- Dr Wilkes?</i>
<i>- He didn't make it.</i>

00:51.761 --> 00:53.054
Is Dr Wilkes a suspect

00:53.137 --> 00:54.180
in the explosion at Isodyne?

00:54.430 --> 00:56.515
Why did
he do it? Was it a personal vendetta?

00:56.599 --> 00:58.184
What was Isodyne
working on in the lab?

00:58.267 --> 00:59.643
Is there
a danger of radiation?

00:59.727 --> 01:01.937
Vega, clear a perimeter.
No press for a hundred yards.

01:04.523 --> 01:06.150
- How you holding up?
- I'm fine.

01:06.650 --> 01:08.944
- How goes the search?
- Slow going.

01:10.071 --> 01:11.739
Dr Wilkes brought a lot of work home.

01:12.073 --> 01:14.116
Anything regarding Isodyne's
work on Zero Matter?

01:14.200 --> 01:15.659
Nothing that would explain
why a bunch of gorillas

01:15.743 --> 01:16.994
were shooting at you last night.

01:17.078 --> 01:19.580
They were shooting at Dr Wilkes.
They wanted him killed.

01:19.872 --> 01:21.165
I suppose I did that job for them.

01:22.041 --> 01:23.501
You know what happened
at the lab was an accident.

01:23.626 --> 01:25.044
Nevertheless, Dr Wilkes is dead,

01:25.169 --> 01:27.296
and the only lead
that we have in the case is a tie pin,

01:27.713 --> 01:29.840
the same kind that Dottie Underwood
tried to steal in New York.

01:30.091 --> 01:32.760
I called Thompson when I got back
into the office. Haven't heard back yet.

01:33.177 --> 01:35.638
I doubt he'd call
to report his lack of progress.

01:38.766 --> 01:40.101
Do you hear that?

01:40.601 --> 01:41.852
It's hollow.

01:56.283 --> 01:57.618
There must be 50 grand in here.

01:57.701 --> 01:59.411
Plane ticket
to Moscow, one way.

02:01.831 --> 02:03.082
And a Russian passport.

02:03.165 --> 02:04.792
Why would Wilkes have
a Russian passport?

02:04.875 --> 02:06.627
Maybe because he's a Russian spy.

02:07.962 --> 02:11.006
Do you have any evidence to support
that preposterous theory, Agent Baker?

02:11.465 --> 02:12.675
Found this under his mattress.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.301
Tokarev tt-33.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.596
Same gun that was used to kill
the agents moving Jane Scott's body.

02:18.264 --> 02:19.932
Your pal Wilkes wasn't just a spy.

02:20.558 --> 02:21.684
He killed two of our guys.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.436
A spy who hides every bit
of incriminating evidence

02:24.520 --> 02:26.021
in one easily discovered place?

02:26.188 --> 02:27.398
I don't believe it for one moment.

02:27.565 --> 02:28.858
You think someone planted all this?

02:29.275 --> 02:31.277
I think Isodyne is trying
to frame Dr Wilkes

02:31.360 --> 02:33.028
and they want us to do their dirty work.

02:49.795 --> 02:51.172
End of the line, Colt.

02:52.006 --> 02:53.632
Ain't nowhere else for you to hide.

02:54.300 --> 02:55.509
I own this town.

02:55.885 --> 02:57.428
Tough talk, Sheriff.

02:57.803 --> 02:59.221
Now draw!

02:59.471 --> 03:00.764
Hold it!

03:01.223 --> 03:02.433
You're in the shot!

03:07.146 --> 03:08.898
Still in the shot.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.276
Cut!

03:12.443 --> 03:13.569
That's lunch!

03:13.694 --> 03:15.237
One hour, everybody.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.489
Mr Stark, we have rushes
for you to look at.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.325
I always thought
you should be in pictures, Peg.

03:19.992 --> 03:21.911
What do you say?
Arlene French called in drunk.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.412
You want to play a sassy beer wench?

03:23.495 --> 03:25.581
- I'd rather be the cowboy.
- I like it.

03:25.789 --> 03:27.249
I don't think the audience is ready yet.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.460
But they're ready
for a movie based on a comic book?

03:29.668 --> 03:30.878
Sounds like a dreadful idea.

03:31.003 --> 03:32.796
I'll have you know,
this is a historical drama.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.673
Kid Colt was a real person.

03:35.925 --> 03:39.136
And if it fails, there will be
a substantial write-off come tax season.

03:40.846 --> 03:42.514
Sorry I missed you last night.
We wrapped late.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.808
And Irene Dunne
and I wrapped even later.

03:45.017 --> 03:47.102
Do you have time to talk
about the real world for a moment?

03:51.148 --> 03:52.524
Unbelievable.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.611
That rift snuffed out
an atomic explosion like a match.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.739
You got a blockbuster flick
on your hands, Peg.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.033
You have any idea what could do that?

04:01.116 --> 04:03.494
Zero Matter, or at least that's
what Dr Wilkes thought.

04:03.577 --> 04:04.745
I was hoping you'd have some answers.

04:04.870 --> 04:06.914
Well, that kind of power
doesn't exist in the natural world.

04:07.331 --> 04:09.041
This Zero Matter stuff...

04:09.667 --> 04:11.168
This could be
the greatest find of the century.

04:11.335 --> 04:13.879
Well, apparently, it's important enough
for Isodyne to fabricate a story

04:13.963 --> 04:15.631
about Dr Wilkes being a communist.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.007
You know,
that's an easy enough setup.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.968
He's already a target
'cause of the colour of his skin.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.095
I won't let them tarnish
Dr Wilkes' name like this.

04:23.347 --> 04:25.099
Wilkes was a member
of the Arena Club?

04:25.599 --> 04:27.059
- Is that what that pin is from?
- Yeah.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.811
And I'm amazed
they allowed him to be a member.

04:29.270 --> 04:31.188
They keep their ranks male and pale.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.899
Jarvis here isn't
even white enough for them.

04:34.984 --> 04:37.069
Please. I'm 1/16 Turkish.

04:37.403 --> 04:38.737
What kind of organisation is it?

04:38.988 --> 04:40.030
Social club.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.158
For LA's silver spoon crowd
since 1906.

04:43.701 --> 04:45.536
The influential, the powerful,

04:45.703 --> 04:47.204
the reptilia and the rodentia.

04:47.413 --> 04:49.415
The Arena Club is where
they all congregate.

04:49.832 --> 04:52.584
They've been trying unsuccessfully
to recruit Mr Stark for years.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.003
I'm not a joiner.

04:55.212 --> 04:57.548
- Women aren't allowed.
- Well, there's that, too.

04:58.382 --> 05:00.968
That pin belonged to one of the men
that tried to kill me last night,

05:01.093 --> 05:03.762
and Dottie Underwood tried to steal
one just like it back in New York.

05:04.138 --> 05:05.597
Who is Dottie Underwood?

05:06.640 --> 05:07.933
She kidnapped you.

05:10.019 --> 05:11.770
At gunpoint, not long ago.

05:14.106 --> 05:15.607
You were wearing
your brown mohair jacket.

05:15.691 --> 05:16.734
The Russian knockout

05:16.817 --> 05:17.901
with the killer backhand.

05:18.444 --> 05:20.696
A soviet spy in an old-boys club?

05:20.863 --> 05:22.656
What the hell
have you gotten yourself into, Peg?

05:22.865 --> 05:25.367
I don't know. But at least
I know where to start looking.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.518
You scared the life out of me.

05:51.602 --> 05:52.936
- Front page above the fold.
- Hmm?

05:54.063 --> 05:56.398
You were right,
the commie angle was perfect.

05:56.482 --> 05:58.067
Cops didn't doubt our story
for a minute.

05:58.317 --> 06:00.277
Well, you're the one that sold it.

06:00.819 --> 06:02.696
I'm not the only actor
in the house, hmm?

06:04.073 --> 06:05.199
Why aren't you at work?

06:06.075 --> 06:08.369
Oh, I was...
I wasn't feeling well this morning. I...

06:08.452 --> 06:10.371
- Oh. You okay?
- Oh, yes.

06:10.829 --> 06:12.539
- I'm better now.
- Good.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.209
I'm gonna pull the '39 MoÃ«t
out of the cellar.

06:15.959 --> 06:17.086
Cal.

06:19.171 --> 06:21.382
What if I told you
I wanted to retire from acting?

06:23.592 --> 06:25.135
You mean after the election, right?

06:26.595 --> 06:28.931
I'd hate for anything
to overshadow the campaign now.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.392
No.

06:31.809 --> 06:32.935
Of course.

06:33.352 --> 06:36.021
Of course.
It was just idle thoughts, and...

06:39.191 --> 06:41.485
We win this thing and move
to Washington,

06:41.568 --> 06:44.238
you can retire
and have all the babies you want.

06:46.448 --> 06:48.409
Mmm. That sounds wonderful.

06:53.705 --> 06:54.790
How did they get this?

06:54.957 --> 06:56.500
We haven't even released
a statement yet.

06:56.583 --> 06:58.043
Isodyne desperately wants
the world to believe

06:58.127 --> 06:59.795
that Jason Wilkes is a communist.

06:59.878 --> 07:01.672
And they have friends at the <i>Times.</i>

07:04.508 --> 07:05.759
Well...

07:06.093 --> 07:07.886
Look who finally decided
to show up for work.

07:07.970 --> 07:09.763
- Jack, what...
- An appalling surprise.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.223
I missed you too, Marge.

07:11.432 --> 07:13.308
- What are you doing here?
- Hey.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.477
I had some business in town.

07:15.602 --> 07:19.273
Figured I'd drop by and clean up
another one of your messes.

07:19.398 --> 07:20.649
Is that what you think you do?

07:21.108 --> 07:23.152
Your incident report
from the accident at Isodyne...

07:23.902 --> 07:25.279
I fixed a couple of details.

07:25.404 --> 07:27.614
"I chased the Russian spy into the lab

07:27.698 --> 07:29.783
"but couldn't apprehend him
before he set off an explosion."

07:29.867 --> 07:30.909
This is rubbish.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.704
This is covering your behind, Carter.

07:34.413 --> 07:37.166
I'm not filing a report about you running
around Hollywood with this guy.

07:38.417 --> 07:39.668
People might get the wrong idea.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.044
And what idea is that?

07:41.545 --> 07:42.713
That you're a communist.

07:42.838 --> 07:45.048
The only communist
I know is Dottie Underwood.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.843
Have you gotten one iota
of information out of her yet?

07:48.260 --> 07:51.054
Or is she still rearranging
the office furniture atop your sternum?

07:52.848 --> 07:54.892
Don't worry about things
that don't concern you, Carter.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.728
She was stealing from the very
organisation that we are investigating.

07:57.895 --> 08:00.147
And that investigation is concluded.

08:03.609 --> 08:06.111
- Your John Hancock, please.
- I'm not signing my name to that.

08:07.404 --> 08:08.447
Fine.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.990
You don't need to.

08:10.157 --> 08:12.910
You can't do that, Jack. She was acting
as a part of my investigation.

08:13.118 --> 08:15.120
On loan from my office.

08:15.245 --> 08:17.289
Isodyne is using Wilkes as a patsy.

08:17.372 --> 08:19.541
They found something so dangerous,
it destroyed their own lab.

08:19.625 --> 08:21.251
Now they're pretending
it never happened.

08:21.710 --> 08:23.962
- If only you could prove that.
- Watch the Isodyne film.

08:24.046 --> 08:25.506
See for yourself what they're hiding.

08:25.964 --> 08:28.717
I already read the book, and it stunk.

08:28.842 --> 08:30.427
The case is closed.

08:32.513 --> 08:34.473
I'd forgotten what a pleasure
it was to work with you.

08:50.989 --> 08:53.158
Can't believe this.
Absolutely ridiculous man.

08:53.242 --> 08:55.577
It's nearly 10:00. Does Howard know
that I'm waiting on him?

08:55.702 --> 08:57.246
Take a number, honey.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.581
And, um, who are these people, please?

08:59.790 --> 09:02.042
According to the accountants,
production assistants.

09:02.209 --> 09:05.170
I see. Well, they all look very... Useful.

09:05.462 --> 09:06.588
Not in the slightest.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.799
Somebody turn down the sun, please.

09:09.591 --> 09:11.385
Have you quite finished
fannying about?

09:11.760 --> 09:13.428
We have work to do.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.555
I am working.

09:14.680 --> 09:17.599
It's called thinking. They help me think.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.768
I need to find out more
about the Arena Club.

09:19.851 --> 09:21.395
Who's a member,
who's a friend, who's an enemy,

09:21.478 --> 09:22.980
and most important of all,

09:23.063 --> 09:24.898
what do they talk about
behind all those closed doors?

09:24.982 --> 09:27.693
I'll tell you what they talk about.
Buying low, selling high, and gout.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.111
I want to plant listening devices

09:29.194 --> 09:30.779
in the club and let them
incriminate themselves.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.489
Well, that sounds boring.

09:32.781 --> 09:34.116
You want something jazzier.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.827
Besides, that club is men only,
remember?

09:37.369 --> 09:38.954
And you'll have
complications pulling that off.

09:39.204 --> 09:42.624
My plan will have enough jazz
for your liking, and believe me,

09:43.000 --> 09:44.042
you won't be bored.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.128
Come on. Who's a good boy?

09:46.211 --> 09:47.588
- Hey.
- Howard's a good boy.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.006
Give that back.

10:05.606 --> 10:06.898
Uh, just a second.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.323
- Chief?
- Yeah.

10:14.615 --> 10:15.866
Someone here to see you.

10:17.743 --> 10:18.994
Vernon!

10:20.454 --> 10:21.496
It's good to see you.

10:22.039 --> 10:24.791
Thanks for coming out
to the coast on such short notice.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.835
How do you like it out here so far?

10:27.044 --> 10:28.545
I wish I'd packed my clubs.

10:28.629 --> 10:30.631
But I'm guessing
you didn't call me out here for golf.

10:31.882 --> 10:34.134
You've been briefed
on the situation at Isodyne?

10:35.010 --> 10:37.179
Just crossing the t's
on that report right now.

10:38.305 --> 10:40.307
It will be very uncontroversial.

10:42.684 --> 10:44.436
The spy, Wilkes...

10:45.103 --> 10:49.441
He stole some sensitive material from
the lab before he blew up the place.

10:50.108 --> 10:51.652
I'm gonna need your help recovering it.

10:52.069 --> 10:55.822
Well, as far as I know, we've recovered
everything Wilkes stole from Isodyne.

10:55.906 --> 10:58.116
What kind of sensitive materials
are we talking about?

10:58.408 --> 10:59.910
Oh, you'll know it when you see it.

11:02.287 --> 11:05.374
The SSR isn't typically in the business
of handing over key evidence.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.167
Come on, Jack.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.169
We talked about this.

11:09.503 --> 11:11.505
There are bigger fish than the SSR,
and right now,

11:11.588 --> 11:14.424
they're more concerned
with a breach of national security

11:14.758 --> 11:16.259
than evidence protocol.

11:17.386 --> 11:19.888
How is the accident at Isodyne
a breach of national security?

11:20.097 --> 11:24.101
If the material that Wilkes stole
falls into the wrong hands,

11:24.184 --> 11:27.521
it could be disastrous
for the United States.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.439
Well...

11:30.190 --> 11:33.610
If the SSR has it,
it's in the right hands.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.404
Don't be a boy scout, Jack.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.782
I know you understand what I'm saying.

11:42.160 --> 11:43.704
If I find anything...

11:45.747 --> 11:46.832
I'll let you know.

11:47.666 --> 11:50.085
You give me a call. We'll do lunch.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.880
Apparently, that's the sort of thing
that goes on out here.

12:02.013 --> 12:03.557
You'll find the majority
of our membership

12:03.640 --> 12:05.559
hails from the Ivy League, of course.

12:05.809 --> 12:07.894
Harvard, Yale, Princeton.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.939
Last month, we even admitted
a gentleman from Brown.

12:11.106 --> 12:12.274
Heaven help us.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.401
Brown... Heaven help us, indeed.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.695
Our members' median income
hovers around...

12:16.778 --> 12:18.029
Excuse me, Terry.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.198
- Torrance.
- Yeah. That martini...

12:20.866 --> 12:22.826
- It's been about five minutes.
- Yes.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.369
Well, how many more
minutes before I get it?

12:24.494 --> 12:26.788
Perhaps I could render
your busy bartender some assistance.

12:27.038 --> 12:28.665
I assure you, Leopold is quite capable...

12:28.749 --> 12:31.042
Listen, Torrance,
you got one hell of a building here.

12:31.460 --> 12:34.296
Unfortunately, what you got inside that
building is duller than Sunday mass.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.673
Take my word for it.
It can get quite raucous.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.675
Why, just yesterday we had

12:38.759 --> 12:41.219
the monthly rehearsal of
our very own barbershop quartet.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.639
I'm sure if you met some
of the gentlemen, you would have...

12:44.723 --> 12:46.558
That's the problem.
You've got a surplus of gentlemen.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.728
Women are not allowed
in the Arena Club.

12:49.978 --> 12:53.190
The great Eleanor Roosevelt herself
was turned away at our threshold.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.358
Well, I've seen old Ellie's threshold.

12:55.650 --> 12:57.068
I believe you've made the right choice.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.112
Nope. I've got something
different in mind.

12:59.488 --> 13:01.281
- Jarvis.
- Sir.

13:04.367 --> 13:06.077
Welcome to the Arena Club, ladies.

13:06.828 --> 13:10.248
And don't ever say Howard Stark didn't
get completely behind the suffragettes.

13:10.332 --> 13:13.251
You'll find the lounge through here,
and the pool table on the left.

13:13.335 --> 13:15.587
Anyone gives you any lip,
tell them to deal with Terry there.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.172
Mr Stark!

13:17.380 --> 13:20.675
- This way to the bar, ladies.
- No. No, no, no, no.

13:20.759 --> 13:22.844
You are not allowed in here.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.262
Come on in, don't be shy.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.507
You must be Leopold.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.009
Allow me to show you how to make
a martini in a timely fashion.

14:10.225 --> 14:13.019
Security, we have a code pink.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.314
Thank you.

14:42.299 --> 14:43.967
I'm sure it's hard to see right now,

14:44.259 --> 14:46.428
but you just helped safeguard
your country's future.

14:46.928 --> 14:48.930
And your own.

16:30.073 --> 16:31.282
Get me security.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.243
I need Warshauer in the chambers now.

16:35.245 --> 16:36.579
I think we might have a breach.

16:38.748 --> 16:41.209
I don't know. Just something ain't right.

16:49.384 --> 16:50.969
Just get him down here.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.172
Hey, you!

17:27.547 --> 17:29.215
You're not supposed to be in here.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.512
Miss Wendy!

17:35.889 --> 17:38.141
The powder room is that way.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.435
Oh! I'm so sorry.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.729
I get really confused around books.

17:46.733 --> 17:47.776
Hmm.

17:52.322 --> 17:53.406
You know what, Terry?

17:53.531 --> 17:55.617
I think I might've been
a little bit harsh on this place.

17:56.284 --> 17:58.536
- You're not half bad.
- Mr Stark, it's time to go.

17:59.704 --> 18:01.790
Actually, your club's terrible,
and I'm never coming back.

18:01.956 --> 18:02.999
Come on, girls.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.502
Let's go back to my pool
and play watergiggles.

18:08.630 --> 18:12.008
This is a private club. In America.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.636
You need a search warrant,
probable cause.

18:14.719 --> 18:18.139
What part of "this case is closed"
was unclear to you, Carter?

18:18.348 --> 18:20.141
I told you there was a conspiracy afoot.

18:20.517 --> 18:23.895
The Arena Club is fabricating the future
just the way that they fabricated

18:23.978 --> 18:25.146
the story about Dr Wilkes.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.689
The newspapers I found are proof.

18:27.190 --> 18:30.276
The headline read
"Anderson Ankles election."

18:30.985 --> 18:33.196
- What the hell does that even mean?
- It means he's stepping down.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.323
I speak Hollywood now.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.034
The date on the newspaper
is tomorrow's date.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.745
They were giving
Representative Anderson a warning.

18:40.829 --> 18:44.541
"Resign willingly and we'll play nice.
Refuse and we'll ruin your life."

18:44.791 --> 18:46.292
Either way, the results stay the same.

18:46.376 --> 18:48.419
Calvin Chadwick
wins a seat in the senate.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.338
The Arena Club knows
what's happening tomorrow

18:50.421 --> 18:51.840
because they're making it happen.

18:53.133 --> 18:55.468
Do you have any idea the can of worms
you're asking me to open?

18:56.261 --> 18:58.429
Rigging an election
is a serious accusation.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.348
All the more reason to listen to Peggy.

19:00.932 --> 19:02.225
Where are those newspapers?

19:02.725 --> 19:03.935
I... I had to leave them behind.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.604
Well, of course you did. God forbid
bringing me actual evidence.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.815
Hold on, Jack. If something
comes up on one of Peggy's bugs,

19:08.898 --> 19:11.317
- we have all the evidence that we need.
- The bugs were destroyed.

19:11.693 --> 19:13.236
The club must have had
some kind of countermeasure

19:13.361 --> 19:14.696
that shorted out all of Howard's devices.

19:14.779 --> 19:15.864
So you've got nothing?

19:15.947 --> 19:17.907
Why are we even having
this conversation?

19:17.991 --> 19:20.201
Because we need to
dig deeper into the Arena Club.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.579
- It ain't happening.
- They're colluding to throw an election.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.205
They've already smeared
a man they tried to kill.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.791
God, you are so hell bent
on clearing your pal Wilkes.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.877
I think your emotions
are clouding your judgement.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.336
You're being a coward!

19:30.670 --> 19:31.713
Peggy.

19:32.422 --> 19:34.632
You are so afraid
of ruffling powerful feathers

19:34.716 --> 19:36.134
that you're doing what you always do.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.679
Burying an ugly truth and hoping
someone will pin a medal on you.

19:47.228 --> 19:48.271
You're done here.

19:49.814 --> 19:51.232
Get on the next plane back to New York.

20:00.325 --> 20:02.202
- If he thinks I'm just gonna drop this...
- He's not wrong.

20:02.452 --> 20:03.953
Are you on his side?

20:05.538 --> 20:07.582
You know I'm on your side.
I believe you.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.918
But you're kicking yourself
so hard for what happened to Wilkes...

20:10.001 --> 20:11.252
I got him killed, Daniel.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.213
He went into that lab
of his own free will.

20:13.671 --> 20:16.090
He was a civilian, a rare bird
trying to do right in the world,

20:16.174 --> 20:17.383
and I treated him like a soldier.

20:18.009 --> 20:20.428
All I'm saying is, I think you're on
to something with the Arena Club,

20:20.511 --> 20:22.847
but if you keep acting like
the lone ranger, I cannot help you.

20:22.931 --> 20:24.057
I'm doing what needs to be done.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.642
If you are unwilling
and unable to help...

20:25.725 --> 20:27.435
Stop. Look.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.940
- Peggy...
- No, don't touch me.

20:32.023 --> 20:34.692
I've seen this before.
This is a side effect of Zero Matter.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.278
If I'm contaminated, then you mustn't
come anywhere near me.

20:37.487 --> 20:39.155
- Well, we got to do something.
- I agree.

20:45.745 --> 20:46.788
Wow.

20:47.664 --> 20:49.624
- That's wild.
- But treatable, I hope.

21:00.927 --> 21:01.970
Oh.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.973
Damn. Should've used the cheap stuff.

21:05.223 --> 21:07.225
We get it. Stuff floats around her. Why?

21:07.600 --> 21:09.560
And how? Is she okay?

21:09.727 --> 21:11.813
Everybody's so impatient.
You're missing the obvious.

21:12.397 --> 21:13.523
Anybody?

21:14.649 --> 21:17.527
The temperature around Peggy
is approximately seven degrees cooler

21:17.610 --> 21:19.028
than the rest of the room.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.780
Not unlike the lady in the lake.

21:21.406 --> 21:22.699
And the detective.

21:22.991 --> 21:25.076
- And the medical examiner.
- That's a constant.

21:25.660 --> 21:28.288
- A good thing to have in an equation.
- But they all froze to death.

21:29.998 --> 21:31.207
Relax.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.001
You're not freezing.

21:33.084 --> 21:35.086
You're not contaminated
with Zero Matter.

21:36.421 --> 21:37.797
Who can tell me how I know this?

21:38.214 --> 21:39.424
Are you teaching a class?

21:41.259 --> 21:42.969
Jarvis, you have a hypothesis?

21:43.344 --> 21:45.680
There's a disruption in
the gravitational field near Miss Carter.

21:46.180 --> 21:48.558
- Excellent.
- How do we get it to stop, Professor?

21:48.766 --> 21:49.892
I've got an idea.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.731
Film making isn't art.
It's more than that.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.942
It's science, which is why I'm gonna
beat these movie yahoos

21:58.026 --> 21:59.319
at their own game.

21:59.402 --> 22:00.987
Because of your boundless modesty?

22:01.529 --> 22:04.407
Photography is the science
of capturing light in its permanent form.

22:05.325 --> 22:07.535
When you capture that light,
the image is still invisible.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.787
And that's when
the developing process comes in.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.164
You're using silver nitrate.

22:11.581 --> 22:13.708
That's what photographers
use to bind images to celluloid.

22:16.627 --> 22:18.880
Come on.
It's the strategic scientific reserve.

22:19.672 --> 22:20.923
The silver nitrate...

22:21.507 --> 22:25.345
Creates a photosensitive coating which
re-creates the captured image onto film.

22:26.137 --> 22:28.723
But Jarvis and I have been working
on a new chemical solution.

22:29.974 --> 22:32.310
Mr Stark's process would make
all invisible wavelengths...

22:32.643 --> 22:34.562
Ultraviolet, x-ray, infrared...

22:34.645 --> 22:36.773
Not just visible but recordable.

22:36.898 --> 22:39.275
If I can pull that off,
I'll make a fortune.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.110
Another fortune.

22:41.235 --> 22:44.947
You think your formula can make,
well, this visible?

22:45.490 --> 22:46.741
It exists.

22:46.949 --> 22:49.077
By definition, it must be observable.

22:49.494 --> 22:50.787
Ready to give it a go?

22:57.752 --> 22:58.836
It's working.

23:03.841 --> 23:05.093
Dr Wilkes.

23:18.189 --> 23:19.524
Howard, what's happened?
Why can't I touch him?

23:19.732 --> 23:21.067
He's visible. He's just not tangible.

23:21.401 --> 23:22.527
You can't touch him any more
than you can touch

23:22.610 --> 23:23.694
a light out of a projector.

23:23.778 --> 23:24.946
Is he ultraviolet?

23:25.196 --> 23:26.614
He's somewhere outside
our visible spectrum.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.325
- Interesting.
- Why can't he talk?

23:30.618 --> 23:31.994
Say "ahh."

23:34.455 --> 23:35.832
I didn't coat his vocal cords.

23:36.165 --> 23:38.084
Now I have, may have enough mass

23:38.167 --> 23:40.378
to create an audible frequency
when they vibrate.

23:40.795 --> 23:43.131
- Are you all right?
- I think I'm gonna throw up.

23:44.257 --> 23:45.425
It's not that bad.

23:45.800 --> 23:46.843
Am I dead?

23:47.051 --> 23:48.428
We thought so, but apparently not.

23:48.761 --> 23:51.097
Oh. Good.

23:51.347 --> 23:52.515
Good.

23:53.850 --> 23:56.519
I've been shadowing you since last
night, trying to get you to notice me.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.481
Well, I was hoping my formula would
create more than a visible presence.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.276
- I must have fallen short.
- Can we make him whole again?

24:04.110 --> 24:05.153
I don't know.

24:08.156 --> 24:09.407
Thank you for getting me this far.

24:10.241 --> 24:12.493
Dr Wilkes, do you remember
what happened to you

24:12.577 --> 24:14.745
the other night at Isodyne Energy?

24:15.037 --> 24:16.414
Yeah. In the lab, I...

24:17.290 --> 24:19.041
I was going for the Zero Matter sample,

24:20.001 --> 24:21.335
and Whitney Frost showed up.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.837
Whitney Frost, the actress?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.338
And wife of Calvin Chadwick,

24:24.422 --> 24:26.632
senatorial candidate and owner
of Isodyne Energy.

24:26.716 --> 24:27.758
What was she doing there?

24:27.842 --> 24:30.011
The same thing I was doing.
She wanted Zero Matter.

24:30.178 --> 24:33.556
She had a gun. She said that she knew
more about Zero Matter than I did.

24:33.890 --> 24:35.391
She grabbed for it, and it fell.

24:35.600 --> 24:36.684
Boom!

24:36.767 --> 24:38.603
So she was caught up
in the explosion, as well.

24:38.811 --> 24:39.854
I was closer...

24:39.937 --> 24:41.606
So I took the brunt of the explosion.

24:43.941 --> 24:44.984
Howard!

24:45.359 --> 24:46.819
The emulsion must be wearing off.

24:47.028 --> 24:49.155
I didn't think he'd shed it so quick,
but the Brownian motion...

24:49.238 --> 24:50.531
Fix him!

24:55.203 --> 24:58.331
It's all right, Dr Wilkes. You stay
right there. We'll figure this out.

25:00.416 --> 25:01.959
From the pharmacy,
get me some saline solution

25:02.043 --> 25:03.503
and some sterilised water.

25:03.586 --> 25:07.048
From the lab, get me some silver halide
and some ammonium thiosulfate.

25:07.215 --> 25:09.091
And pick up any heavy metal
you can find, just in case.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.968
Oh, and from the market,
get me some of that cheese I like.

25:11.052 --> 25:12.678
You know, what is it?
That, uh, yellow one. Uh...

25:13.346 --> 25:15.056
- Velveeta.
- Velveeta.

25:15.973 --> 25:17.099
I'll get two bricks.

25:18.726 --> 25:20.311
That's quite a spring
in your step, Jarvis.

25:21.229 --> 25:22.688
You and Peggy make a great team.

25:23.439 --> 25:25.191
I'm happy to help out Miss Carter
in any way I can.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.527
You just make sure you let me
know if I'm gonna need

25:27.610 --> 25:29.195
to find myself a new butler.

25:30.738 --> 25:32.114
I'm more than happy in my position, sir.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.741
I know. I'm great.

25:34.700 --> 25:35.785
But so is she.

25:35.952 --> 25:37.036
Is there anything we can do to help?

25:37.119 --> 25:38.913
Not unless you can
improve on my formula

25:39.539 --> 25:41.165
or make it permanent, then,
no, you can't.

25:41.874 --> 25:44.085
I'm gonna stay up day and night
to figure this out for you, Peg.

25:44.168 --> 25:45.461
I know how important it is for you.

25:45.836 --> 25:47.838
Dr Wilkes is a crucial part
of my investigation.

25:48.005 --> 25:49.048
Of course.

25:49.131 --> 25:51.801
And he's a good man who's
in over his head because of me.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.302
He deserves a better fate than this.

25:56.764 --> 25:58.933
Well, then,
there's no time to lose. I'm off.

26:00.601 --> 26:01.936
Can I do fondue
with that cheese?

26:02.019 --> 26:03.104
You can't do anything.

26:03.354 --> 26:04.564
We should get back to work.

26:04.730 --> 26:06.524
I'm persona non grata
at the SSR at the moment.

26:06.607 --> 26:09.318
I could use your help finding out what
Whitney Frost wants with Zero Matter

26:09.402 --> 26:10.945
and how she purports
to know so much about it.

26:11.737 --> 26:13.281
You think she survived the explosion?

26:13.447 --> 26:14.490
I assume so.

26:14.699 --> 26:16.367
If a movie star had the sniffles,
we'd know about it,

26:16.450 --> 26:18.286
let alone being blown up
in a laboratory accident.

26:18.452 --> 26:19.745
I'll do some digging into her.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.164
- What are you gonna do?
- I'm going to poke the bear.

26:27.336 --> 26:30.172
Miss Frost? Peggy Carter.
Do you have a moment?

26:30.673 --> 26:31.716
Of course.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.843
And it's Agent Carter, isn't it?

26:34.176 --> 26:37.138
Yes, we met at the racetrack,
but we were never properly introduced.

26:37.305 --> 26:38.806
I must admit,
I was a little star struck.

26:38.889 --> 26:40.433
I've never met
a famous movie star before.

26:40.683 --> 26:42.393
Oh, please.
We're just like everybody else.

26:42.977 --> 26:45.021
We put our pearls on
one strand at a time.

26:46.647 --> 26:48.816
And they are just letting anyone

26:49.025 --> 26:50.735
waltz onto the studio lot these days.

26:51.068 --> 26:54.071
I find being polite
and asking nicely opens many doors.

26:54.155 --> 26:55.281
Oh, I'm sure it does.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.950
Actually, I wanted to ask you
about the incident at Isodyne.

26:59.827 --> 27:00.953
It was horrible.

27:01.871 --> 27:04.790
It's just horrible
what happened to, uh, Mr Wilson.

27:04.915 --> 27:06.959
Wilkes, Dr Wilkes.

27:08.836 --> 27:10.296
Did you know he was a communist?

27:10.463 --> 27:11.547
I can't say that I did.

27:12.340 --> 27:13.799
I guess he fooled all of us.

27:14.508 --> 27:16.135
Isn't it incredible to think one of them

27:16.218 --> 27:18.971
could just infiltrate a secure lab?

27:20.806 --> 27:23.392
- What do you know of Isodyne's work?
- Not a thing.

27:23.851 --> 27:24.935
Oh, please.

27:25.019 --> 27:28.481
The thought of my husband's work
gives me a terrible migraine.

27:29.148 --> 27:30.900
But you were there
the night of the explosion.

27:31.150 --> 27:33.611
A security guard saw you
at the lab just before the accident.

27:33.736 --> 27:35.196
Well, he made a mistake.

27:35.946 --> 27:39.408
Let's see. I left Cal's office at 9:00,
security goes home at 10:00.

27:39.575 --> 27:40.993
I think the newspaper
said the explosion happened

27:41.077 --> 27:42.203
sometime after midnight?

27:42.495 --> 27:44.246
Papers are in the business
of selling papers.

27:44.789 --> 27:46.874
Finding facts
isn't always their top priority.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.834
Truer words, Agent Carter.

27:49.377 --> 27:53.422
You know, last week, the press said that
I was involved in a torrid love affair

27:53.506 --> 27:54.632
with Cary Grant.

27:55.966 --> 27:57.218
I should be so lucky.

27:57.301 --> 27:58.803
Well, that's why I trust my instincts.

27:59.303 --> 28:01.180
They're more reliable
than what I'm told to believe.

28:02.765 --> 28:04.934
And what are your instincts
telling you now?

28:05.893 --> 28:07.228
That things aren't what they seem.

28:07.895 --> 28:09.605
Yes.

28:09.730 --> 28:12.149
Miss Frost, we're ready
for you, sweetheart.

28:12.775 --> 28:15.528
Okay. Well, duty calls, Agent Carter.

28:16.320 --> 28:17.446
If you'll excuse me.

28:18.114 --> 28:19.699
- You look great.
- Oh, thank you.

28:31.085 --> 28:32.586
This what you're looking for?

28:33.963 --> 28:35.089
Did you watch it?

28:35.214 --> 28:37.508
If Rita Hayworth's not in it,
I'm not interested.

28:43.639 --> 28:45.224
You're doing the right thing, Jack.

28:50.062 --> 28:51.522
I trust you.

28:54.483 --> 28:56.026
No one will remember this meeting

28:56.110 --> 28:58.320
when the history books
are written, but I will.

28:58.738 --> 29:01.157
If it was up to me,
you'd get a medal for this.

29:01.532 --> 29:04.034
You're doing a great service
for the United States.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.705
That's all I ever wanted to do.

29:16.005 --> 29:18.090
Lambda
is given by Planck's constant,

29:18.174 --> 29:19.341
divided by mc...

29:19.508 --> 29:20.634
Except
we can't calculate "m"

29:20.718 --> 29:22.511
without an accurate reading
of your mass.

29:22.762 --> 29:24.764
No mass, no wavelength.

29:25.389 --> 29:26.724
- Hey, Peg.
- You're back.

29:26.974 --> 29:28.559
Yeah, and he's good.

29:29.143 --> 29:31.061
- Stark Industries good.
- Excellent news.

29:31.187 --> 29:33.606
Chances are, he'll need a job
once he regains his corporeal self.

29:33.731 --> 29:35.566
If he regains his corporeal self.

29:35.649 --> 29:37.693
We'll get there.
I just need to stay alert.

29:37.985 --> 29:39.320
Coffee. Who wants a coffee?

29:39.487 --> 29:42.031
Maybe Irish coffee.
Jarvis, where's the coffee around here?

29:43.157 --> 29:44.950
"If he regains himself?"

29:45.534 --> 29:46.911
This is...

29:48.245 --> 29:50.873
I have no idea what this is,
and I don't know if I can fix it.

29:51.415 --> 29:52.833
You're in the best hands imaginable.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.336
You really think Stark can fix me?

29:55.836 --> 29:58.422
- I meant your hands.
- That's kind of you.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.549
In a very short space of time,

30:00.800 --> 30:02.718
you've managed to do
what very few have done.

30:03.844 --> 30:05.471
You've impressed Howard Stark.

30:06.555 --> 30:07.765
And you've impressed me.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.476
You don't even know me that well.

30:11.018 --> 30:12.645
I'm an excellent judge of character.

30:15.272 --> 30:16.482
Couldn't find any coffee.

30:22.071 --> 30:23.280
You're here late.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.368
Yeah, early bird's
got nothing on the night owl.

30:28.577 --> 30:29.745
Let's see what you have here.

30:33.666 --> 30:36.710
Agnes Cully, Broxton, Oklahoma...
Sounds interesting.

30:37.503 --> 30:40.756
Almost sorry I...
Pulled Carter away from all the fun.

30:41.382 --> 30:42.716
I'm sure you two have
plenty of excitement

30:42.800 --> 30:43.884
waiting for you back in New York.

30:43.968 --> 30:45.135
Yeah.

30:47.096 --> 30:48.222
She's still a pistol.

30:49.932 --> 30:51.684
You two seem to have
patched up whatever it was

30:51.767 --> 30:53.310
that sent you packing out west.

30:53.644 --> 30:55.938
The only thing that brought me out west
was a promotion, Jack.

30:57.356 --> 30:58.482
You sure it wasn't a broken heart?

31:00.693 --> 31:02.152
I don't know where you get your ideas.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.029
As a matter of fact, I'm getting engaged.

31:04.822 --> 31:06.991
- You're kidding me. Really?
- Yeah.

31:08.742 --> 31:10.244
- Good for you.
- Thank you.

31:12.121 --> 31:15.291
Why don't you wrap this up,
and I'll buy you a drink.

31:15.708 --> 31:16.750
You can tell me all about her.

31:16.917 --> 31:20.379
Uh, sorry, Jack. A chief's work
is never done. You know how it is.

31:20.880 --> 31:22.798
Come on. Oklahoma can wait.

31:23.549 --> 31:26.510
You can show me that frolic
room bar I keep hearing about.

31:28.804 --> 31:30.180
Next time.

31:31.473 --> 31:32.725
Yeah, uh...

31:32.850 --> 31:34.226
You're on.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.646
Next time it will be.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.192
- Take care of yourself, Sousa.
- Safe flight.

31:43.861 --> 31:45.279
Nice shirt.

31:46.906 --> 31:47.948
And then I thought
she was just gonna

31:48.032 --> 31:49.116
pull out a pair of handcuffs

31:49.199 --> 31:50.618
and arrest me on the spot.

31:52.202 --> 31:54.038
- Are you listening?
- No, I'm listening.

31:54.872 --> 31:58.083
Peggy Carter, who does
she think she is, handcuffs...

31:58.167 --> 32:01.629
We have to do something about her,
Cal. She's not gonna just go away.

32:01.837 --> 32:03.088
I got some friends
in the war department.

32:03.172 --> 32:05.841
I will call first thing and make sure
she doesn't bother us any more.

32:05.925 --> 32:08.052
No! No.

32:08.385 --> 32:10.346
Official channels are not gonna cut it.

32:12.264 --> 32:13.474
I know women like her.

32:14.016 --> 32:15.392
What do you want me to do?

32:16.977 --> 32:18.687
I want you to let
Mr Hunt take care of her.

32:20.397 --> 32:21.482
I can't do that.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.945
We've already had enough run-ins
with the feds to last us all year.

32:35.412 --> 32:36.622
She scares me.

32:38.082 --> 32:39.625
- Look, it's okay.
- No.

32:39.750 --> 32:41.418
- We'll think of something.
- No, it's not okay,

32:41.502 --> 32:42.753
'cause you weren't there.

32:42.962 --> 32:45.214
And you don't understand.
She threatened me.

32:45.381 --> 32:47.758
- What did she say?
- She said she knew about Wilkes,

32:47.841 --> 32:49.134
what we did.

32:49.510 --> 32:51.220
She is dangerous.

32:51.845 --> 32:54.598
- Sweetheart, calm down. It's okay.
- She's using me to get to you.

32:55.808 --> 32:58.102
And when she does, I can't...

33:02.314 --> 33:05.150
I would just hate if this
caught the council's attention.

33:12.825 --> 33:14.118
I'll take care of it.

33:14.910 --> 33:17.997
You'll call Mr Hunt.

33:19.415 --> 33:20.624
I'll do it right now.

33:42.479 --> 33:44.398
I'm turning in for the evening,
Miss Carter. Good night.

33:44.523 --> 33:46.525
Good night, Mr Jarvis.

33:47.651 --> 33:50.362
Are you certain it's such a good idea
to be exercising this late at night?

33:50.446 --> 33:52.614
I find an evening workout
is the best way

33:53.032 --> 33:55.576
to release the frustrations
of a given day.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.619
Yes, I see.

33:58.704 --> 34:00.497
I'm sorry you found
the day so disheartening.

34:02.041 --> 34:03.333
Is there anything I might do to help?

34:04.168 --> 34:05.544
Nothing...

34:05.711 --> 34:07.254
Comes to mind.

34:08.756 --> 34:10.090
If you need a sparring partner...

34:12.968 --> 34:15.304
I'm sure Mr Stark would be
more than happy to hire one for you.

34:15.387 --> 34:17.264
I'm fine, Mr Jarvis.

34:18.974 --> 34:20.225
Well...

34:20.976 --> 34:22.478
- Good night.
- Good night.

35:25.082 --> 35:27.459
Miss Carter, are you all right?

35:37.845 --> 35:39.096
Well, good morning, Mr Jarvis.

35:39.388 --> 35:40.556
Miss Carter.

35:40.931 --> 35:42.850
- How are you feeling this morning?
- Reinvigorated.

35:43.016 --> 35:44.101
How's the, um...

35:44.184 --> 35:46.436
Less painful when I remember
we're on the right track.

35:46.562 --> 35:49.231
Whitney Frost acted rashly,
and I will not make the same mistake.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.150
- What's all this?
- Oh! Um...

35:51.567 --> 35:52.776
Improved security measures.

35:52.860 --> 35:55.487
Mr Stark spent the wee small hours
bolstering the estate's alarms

35:55.571 --> 35:57.573
to ensure that we won't
be caught unawares again.

36:00.576 --> 36:01.827
Behold.

36:02.035 --> 36:05.372
<i>Warning. You are not
authorised to access this area.</i>

36:06.039 --> 36:08.375
- Terrifying.
- It's a temporary measure.

36:09.168 --> 36:11.920
I've no desire to spend the rest of time
as a disembodied voice.

36:12.462 --> 36:13.505
Run me through it one more time.

36:13.589 --> 36:14.631
Okay.

36:15.299 --> 36:17.926
- Why don't we take a break?
- Peg, you're up.

36:18.135 --> 36:19.303
- Have you slept?
- Nope.

36:19.428 --> 36:21.138
No sleep. Coffee.

36:21.388 --> 36:22.639
Perhaps a little nap.

36:22.764 --> 36:24.057
I'll do that on the plane to Peru.

36:24.224 --> 36:26.643
- Uh, you're what the where now?
- Peru. The country.

36:27.060 --> 36:31.064
Jason and I realised we need an expert
in subatomic and gravitational physics.

36:31.481 --> 36:32.858
And there's no greater expert
in the world

36:32.983 --> 36:35.694
than my old professor, Abner Brody.

36:35.903 --> 36:37.613
Unfortunately,
he took his brain with him

36:37.696 --> 36:39.740
when he relocated
to the Amazon last year.

36:40.157 --> 36:41.700
I've heard of Brody.
There's no one better.

36:41.783 --> 36:44.244
You crunch the math.
The lab is yours till I get back.

36:44.536 --> 36:45.746
Anything you need,
Jarvis is your man.

36:45.829 --> 36:47.206
I'll be back as soon as I can.

36:48.832 --> 36:50.125
Where's my passport?

36:54.421 --> 36:56.548
I take it you had an interesting night.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.009
That man is a menace.

36:59.092 --> 37:01.845
A genius, but no doubt
a danger to himself and others.

37:02.346 --> 37:05.015
As he's proven time and again,
but he's all right.

37:05.224 --> 37:06.725
He's more than all right.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.144
He invited me... A stranger...

37:09.228 --> 37:11.521
Into his home
without a second of equivocation.

37:12.356 --> 37:13.607
You know how many people
would do that?

37:13.857 --> 37:15.108
He's a good friend.

37:15.609 --> 37:18.237
I'm sorry you met
under such unpleasant circumstances.

37:18.820 --> 37:20.948
I shouldn't have asked you
to go into the lab in the first place.

37:21.448 --> 37:24.159
You mean my lab, to retrieve my work.

37:25.035 --> 37:26.245
Who else was supposed to do it?

37:26.411 --> 37:28.580
Well, nevertheless,
I am sorry you got hurt.

37:29.831 --> 37:31.083
I know.

37:31.333 --> 37:32.501
But better me than you.

37:34.544 --> 37:36.296
Which is why I can't stay here.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.006
"Can't stay here"? Are you mad?

37:38.173 --> 37:40.425
Someone tried to kill me,
and now they're trying to kill you.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.970
I'm removing myself from the equation
before anyone gets hurt.

37:43.053 --> 37:45.222
If you remove yourself
from the people trying to protect you,

37:45.305 --> 37:46.515
you're as good as dead.

37:46.598 --> 37:47.641
Do you think you
would've made it out

37:47.766 --> 37:49.142
of the Griffith Park observatory
without me?

37:49.393 --> 37:51.019
- I can hold my own.
- Oh, don't be a ninny.

37:51.103 --> 37:53.397
You need us. And we need you.

37:54.690 --> 37:57.943
If Whitney Frost is an expert
on Zero Matter, as she claims,

37:58.068 --> 37:59.820
you're our best asset against her.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.740
- Miss Carter...
- You're not going anywhere.

38:04.825 --> 38:06.410
And it's Peggy.

38:09.204 --> 38:12.249
Peggy, I'm not going anywhere.

38:14.084 --> 38:15.252
Good.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.963
- I'm glad you saw reason.
- No, I didn't see reason.

38:18.297 --> 38:20.382
I still think I'm putting
all of you in danger.

38:21.466 --> 38:22.843
But you don't want me to leave,

38:23.635 --> 38:25.304
so that's reason enough for me to stay.

38:28.098 --> 38:29.474
Very well.

38:32.894 --> 38:33.937
Wow.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.523
Usually got to go all the way to France
to get a hickey like that.

38:37.024 --> 38:38.275
- Does it hurt?
- Hopefully not as much

38:38.358 --> 38:40.277
as the bullet hole
I put in my assailant's hand.

38:40.444 --> 38:42.112
You sure you don't want
a security detail?

38:42.321 --> 38:43.697
I want to go back to work.

38:43.864 --> 38:46.450
I thought you were on your way back
to New York with Thompson today.

38:46.616 --> 38:48.035
I thought I'd miss that flight.

38:48.535 --> 38:49.619
Did you find anything in your research?

38:49.911 --> 38:52.956
Yeah, did some digging into Isodyne
and hit pay dirt on their secret weapon.

38:53.248 --> 38:56.626
An Okie named Agnes Cully,
kind of like the heartland's Marie Curie.

38:57.169 --> 38:58.837
These are patents.
She was an inventor?

38:58.962 --> 39:01.840
And then some. Her work put Isodyne
on the map during the war.

39:02.174 --> 39:03.800
You know
the radio frequency modulators

39:03.884 --> 39:06.678
the allies used to send
coded messages across enemy lines?

39:07.137 --> 39:08.930
Rotating the frequencies was her idea.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.223
What has she got to do with our case?

39:10.307 --> 39:13.060
Peggy Carter, meet Agnes Cully.

39:14.311 --> 39:15.979
"Whitney Frost" is her stage name.

39:16.605 --> 39:19.608
America's sweetheart is
the brains behind Isodyne Energy.

39:20.233 --> 39:23.904
Every eye in the country is on her,
and no one sees her.

39:26.114 --> 39:27.491
How much time do you have?

39:28.575 --> 39:31.536
Uh, plane leaves in a little bit
over an hour. Plenty of time.

39:32.245 --> 39:34.956
I know you had a tough call
to make yesterday,

39:35.916 --> 39:40.170
and I just want you to know how much
I appreciate the faith that you put in me.

39:40.921 --> 39:42.214
If you're happy, I'm happy.

39:42.589 --> 39:44.424
My pops will be glad
to hear we're working together.

39:44.508 --> 39:48.261
Great. And everybody's
happy, especially your new best friend.

39:48.470 --> 39:49.971
Jack Thompson,
meet Calvin Chadwick.

39:50.055 --> 39:51.765
Jack, it's great to meet you, pal.

39:51.932 --> 39:54.684
I can't tell you how much everyone
at Isodyne appreciates your help.

39:55.435 --> 39:56.645
It's been a hell of a week.

39:56.812 --> 39:58.480
Well, my pleasure, Mr Chadwick.

39:58.563 --> 39:59.981
Oh, you can call him Calvin.

40:00.357 --> 40:04.069
Although you might want to get used
to calling him Senator Chadwick.

40:09.282 --> 40:11.701
Here's to the youngest
member of the Arena Club,

40:12.077 --> 40:14.579
running for Senate unopposed.

40:14.830 --> 40:16.498
Who could've seen this coming?

40:19.793 --> 40:21.461
Congratulations.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.758
Miss Frost, you got a minute?

40:26.883 --> 40:28.677
Of course. Come in.

40:32.347 --> 40:34.724
Listen, I just got off
the phone with the studio.

40:36.351 --> 40:37.811
Is everything all right?

40:38.520 --> 40:40.021
There's no easy way to say this.

40:40.522 --> 40:41.815
They want to replace you.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.152
- What?
- They're looking for a fresh face.

40:48.238 --> 40:49.364
Someone younger?

40:49.448 --> 40:52.075
I told them I would
walk if they fired you.

40:52.159 --> 40:54.870
I told them nobody
treats my star that way.

40:57.581 --> 40:59.040
They folded.

41:01.084 --> 41:02.752
- Yes.
- Oh, my God.

41:03.545 --> 41:05.422
- Thank you.
- You're my girl.

41:06.006 --> 41:07.215
I'll always take care of you.

41:11.052 --> 41:12.429
Oh, Ken...

41:12.804 --> 41:13.889
Thank you.

41:13.972 --> 41:15.724
Truly, thank you so much.

41:30.322 --> 41:31.364
You are so beautiful.

41:31.740 --> 41:33.074
Ken... Ken, no.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.367
What is that?

41:35.202 --> 41:36.661
- Nothing.
- That is not nothing.

41:36.745 --> 41:38.705
- What happened to your face?
- It's nothing.

41:38.788 --> 41:40.081
- That is not nothing!
- Wait.

41:40.165 --> 41:41.333
Wait!

41:41.791 --> 41:43.168
Oh, my God!
