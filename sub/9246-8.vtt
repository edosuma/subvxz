to cook dinner for us.

it'll be but just put it

you're enjoying it.

Alright, ladies.
Hot meat coming at you.

00:18.235 --> 00:19.889
Oh, my God.

00:19.976 --> 00:24.415
It looks like the barn
caught fire and nobody got out.

00:24.502 --> 00:27.288
We got burgers, bratz and
I threw in a couple of rib eyes

00:27.375 --> 00:31.118
for you gals that like your meat
straight-up.

00:31.205 --> 00:33.903
Are you going to say it
or am I?

00:33.990 --> 00:36.775
I've been biting my tongue
since "hot meat coming at you."

00:38.864 --> 00:40.431
Sweetie are you planning
on serving

00:40.518 --> 00:42.738
any kind of vegetables or,
uh, does everything come

00:42.825 --> 00:44.827
from the petting zoo?

00:44.914 --> 00:46.742
No, hey,
there's vegetables.

00:46.829 --> 00:49.701
Pickles for the burgers,
kraut for the dogs

00:49.788 --> 00:53.357
and farm-fresh tomatoes served
in an easy-to-squeeze bottle.

00:55.055 --> 00:57.883
This, this looks
heart-stoppingly good.

00:57.970 --> 00:59.624
Well, you ladies
are always cooking for me

00:59.711 --> 01:01.365
and I figured a little
payback was in order.

01:01.452 --> 01:02.975
- Thank you.
- Very sweet.

Mrs. Biggs.
What a surprise.

01:27.870 --> 01:32.744
We love it when you drop
by so very unexpectedly.

01:32.831 --> 01:35.443
Let's be honest, if I hadn't put
my finger over that peephole

01:35.530 --> 01:39.490
we wouldn't be having this
conversation.

01:39.577 --> 01:40.970
We've, we've been
meaning to come visit you

01:41.057 --> 01:42.406

01:42.493 --> 01:43.973
and with all the,
the wedding planning..

01:44.060 --> 01:46.410
- Mike!
- I get it.

01:46.497 --> 01:48.064
People get busy,
and some relationships

01:48.151 --> 01:49.370
don't make the cut.

01:49.457 --> 01:50.675
And it's usually
the groom's mother

01:50.762 --> 01:53.243
that gets the brown end
of the stick.

01:55.854 --> 01:57.726
If that means
what I think it means

01:57.813 --> 02:01.469
that's certainly
not a good thing.

02:01.556 --> 02:03.166
Would you, would you like
to sit down?

02:03.253 --> 02:06.126
I would, but my hemorrhoids
are telling me to stand.

Mike!

02:12.088 --> 02:13.481
Mom, what are you doing here?

02:13.568 --> 02:15.787
I just came by
to bring you a little treat.

02:15.874 --> 02:18.312
You always loved your mommy's
seven-layer cookies.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.052
Oh, boy.
Hey, you want to come in?

02:20.140 --> 02:22.011
I was just getting ready
to fire up some baby back ribs.

02:22.098 --> 02:24.535
No, thanks, I drank
a cold can of chicken

02:24.622 --> 02:28.148
and stars before I came over.

02:28.235 --> 02:30.454
Oh, that reminds me,
I got to flip the drumsticks.

02:30.541 --> 02:33.109
Mike, for the love of God,
no more meat!

02:33.196 --> 02:35.981
Oh, God, he's grilling
everything in sight.

in from the yard

I'm on the guest list.

a passing glance

out of my cold, dead hand.

Well, thank you.

I'd never be able to make
these the way that you do.

03:11.930 --> 03:14.237
That's true.

Yeah, right next
to my two best friends

10:44.992 --> 10:46.907
the TV and the toilet.

10:50.084 --> 10:51.302
And now
you're letting Jim just eat

10:51.389 --> 10:53.783
from a 50-pound bag
of dog food?

10:55.698 --> 10:58.483
Hey, if I die in my sleep,
I figure that buys me

10:58.570 --> 11:01.965
about a week before he starts
gnawing at my sweetbreads.

11:05.403 --> 11:08.145
Geez, he's like
a ham in a dog suit.

11:09.581 --> 11:11.845
You should see
the size of his stools.

11:11.932 --> 11:14.804
The other day he had to lay
on his side to finish.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.243
Alright, mom,
listen to me.

11:19.330 --> 11:21.942
I realize I've been
very remiss as a son lately.

11:22.029 --> 11:25.119
I don't blame you, boy,
I understand you got a woman now

11:25.206 --> 11:28.209
and she's dragging you around
by your tickle stick.

11:34.650 --> 11:37.435
Okay.

11:37.522 --> 11:39.220
I promise
I'll come around more.

11:39.307 --> 11:41.222
But you gotta meet me halfway.

11:41.309 --> 11:44.791
- The Arby's on Cicero?
- No!

11:44.878 --> 11:46.401
I mean you gotta
pull yourself together.

11:46.488 --> 11:48.664
You can't just mope around
the house all the time.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.492
Pretty soon Jim's legs
won't be long enough

11:50.579 --> 11:51.841
to keep his wiener
off the ground.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.452
'Oh..'

11:54.539 --> 11:57.847
Hush, now, he's very
self-conscious about his weight.

12:06.464 --> 12:08.640
The point is, you're a strong
woman, a survivor

12:08.728 --> 12:11.948
and it breaks my heart to see
you wallowing in self-pity.

12:12.035 --> 12:14.472
That's because you don't know
what it's like to wake up

12:14.559 --> 12:16.910
and feel so all alone.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.478
You're right, I don't.

12:20.565 --> 12:23.699
I've always had an amazing woman
in my life taking care of me.

12:23.786 --> 12:25.527
And nobody's ever
going to replace her.

12:25.614 --> 12:28.530
[sighs]
Aw, I'm just an old,
tired broad

12:28.617 --> 12:30.227
ready for the scrap heap.

12:30.314 --> 12:31.925
Don't talk that way.

12:32.012 --> 12:34.579
You didn't roll over
and give up when dad left.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.277
Maybe you should think
about getting a job again.

12:36.364 --> 12:37.757
Meet new people.

12:37.844 --> 12:39.584
You know, have someplace
to go every day?

12:39.671 --> 12:43.763
And do what?
Sweep hair at the Supercuts?

12:43.850 --> 12:46.722
Read to the geezers
at the old folks' home?

12:46.809 --> 12:48.985
Hand out samples
of summer sausage

12:49.072 --> 12:52.597
to the moochers
at the grocery store?

12:52.684 --> 12:55.644
All I'm saying is,
you still got a lot to offer.

12:56.514 --> 12:58.952
I am good with people.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.610
You do have a gift.

13:05.697 --> 13:08.091
Hey, do you need any help
around the police station?

13:08.178 --> 13:09.876
No! We do not.

13:11.355 --> 13:13.096
But I'm sure, somewhere,
there's a place

13:13.183 --> 13:14.315
that you'd fit right in.

13:14.402 --> 13:16.360
Hmm.

13:16.447 --> 13:18.710
What's in the chef's stew?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.495
Oh.

13:21.975 --> 13:23.890
So far, I've fished out
two cigarette butts

13:23.977 --> 13:25.587
and a shoelace.
What do you think?

13:25.674 --> 13:27.502
You want to roll the dice?

13:35.292 --> 13:36.424
I think it's a great idea
for your mom

13:36.511 --> 13:38.165
to start working again.

13:38.252 --> 13:40.515
That's why I let my grandma
do little odd jobs for me.

13:40.602 --> 13:42.647
It keeps her young.

13:43.953 --> 13:45.650
Well, she must feel
like a teenager

13:45.737 --> 13:49.263
when she's laying under
your truck changing the oil.

13:49.350 --> 13:51.221
Yeah, it's worth the 20 bucks
I give her

13:51.308 --> 13:53.745
just to see that happy,
greasy smile on her face.

13:55.182 --> 13:57.227
[cell phone ringing]

13:57.314 --> 13:59.099
Oh, it's Molly.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.971
Hey, sweetie, what's going on?

14:02.058 --> 14:03.320
Really?

14:03.407 --> 14:04.974
My mom got a job
at Molly's school.

14:05.061 --> 14:07.585
- That's great!
- That's great.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.413
It's not?

14:09.500 --> 14:12.286
It's not great.

14:12.373 --> 14:13.635
Meatball sub.

14:13.722 --> 14:15.158
Bacon double cheeseburger.

14:15.245 --> 14:17.073
Uh, no, no.
Those are for Carl.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.509
I only eat meat
on the weekends.

14:18.596 --> 14:21.077
I'm having cottage cheese
and sliced peaches.

14:24.820 --> 14:26.343
I can't be a part of this.

14:29.172 --> 14:30.130
Well, look,
you're the one that told me

14:30.217 --> 14:31.958
to go spend time with my mom.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.481
If it's followed
by something horrible

14:33.568 --> 14:36.745
then that's on you, isn't it?

14:36.832 --> 14:40.140
Samuel, can I get an iced
tea with one Splenda?

14:40.227 --> 14:42.664
Order me a chocolate milkshake,
this is gonna take a while.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.364
Really, so you have no idea

14:47.451 --> 14:49.366
why I wasn't invited
to that faculty meeting?

14:49.453 --> 14:52.587
None. The e-mail should have
gone out to everybody.

14:52.674 --> 14:54.981
But you're the one that
sends the e-mails out.

14:55.068 --> 14:57.026
Everyone else got it.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.159
Do you know
how to work your e-mail?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.205
Yes, I do.

15:02.292 --> 15:06.340
And your address
is still jollymolly77?

15:06.427 --> 15:10.910
Close. "Cubfan4."

15:10.997 --> 15:12.215
My bad.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.782
It will not happen again.

15:13.869 --> 15:15.871
Thank you.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.919
- Cafeteria's downstairs.
- I know where it is.

15:20.006 --> 15:24.097
I got sloppy Joe in my hair.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.751
You missed out
on my fresh brownies today.

15:26.838 --> 15:28.188
You ran out of that cafeteria

15:28.275 --> 15:31.365
like a Mexican chasing
a soccer ball.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.802
No, I just had to make
a quick phone call.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.847
Well, I brought you
some premium wedges.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.024
Figured you could take
some home to the boy.

15:38.111 --> 15:40.243
That's sweet, Peggy.
I-I appreciate it.

15:40.330 --> 15:45.074
- Mind if I join you?
- Uh...sure.

15:45.161 --> 15:47.120
I usually put in a swirl
of peanut butter

15:47.207 --> 15:48.904
but apparently, now,
every kid in the world

15:48.991 --> 15:51.167
can't even look at a nut
without his head swelling up

15:51.254 --> 15:54.954
like a ballpark Frank.

15:55.041 --> 15:58.087
Yeah, peanut allergies are
actually pretty serious thing.

15:58.174 --> 16:00.002
That's because
we're raising a generation

16:00.089 --> 16:02.613
of thin-skinned sissies.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.441
I hear
they don't even keep score

16:04.528 --> 16:06.443
at sporting events anymore.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.879
They don't want the kids
to go home

16:07.967 --> 16:09.185
and feel like a loser.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.448
Some of them are losers.

16:13.189 --> 16:15.322
And the sooner they embrace that
the less chance

16:15.409 --> 16:17.193
they'll be
crouching in a bell tower

16:17.280 --> 16:21.110
with a high-powered rifle
and a picture of the president.

16:21.197 --> 16:23.852
Wow, well, if at all possible

16:23.939 --> 16:26.681
we-we try not to refer
to the students as losers.

16:26.768 --> 16:28.900
I've heard you say worse.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.643
I was kidding,
and that was at home

16:32.730 --> 16:35.646
and that was before you and I
had a professional relationship

16:35.733 --> 16:38.432
which is the type
of relationship

16:38.519 --> 16:41.130
we should maintain
while we're on school grounds.

16:41.217 --> 16:42.653
Oh, I get it.

16:42.740 --> 16:44.960
Professor high horse
doesn't want to be seen

16:45.047 --> 16:46.353
with Lola the lunch lady.

16:46.440 --> 16:49.225
No, no, that's
not what I'm saying.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.923
I'm just not comfortable
with my personal life

16:52.011 --> 16:53.882
mixing
with my professional life.

16:53.969 --> 16:57.973
Don't worry. From now on, I'm
just a faceless slop jockey.

16:58.060 --> 17:00.236
Come on, you don't need
to be so dramatic about it.

17:00.323 --> 17:02.108
Hey. That's the way it is.

17:02.195 --> 17:04.153
Lunch ladies are invisible.

17:04.240 --> 17:06.677
But on the plus side,
I hear little kids

17:06.764 --> 17:08.331
talking about cheating on tests

17:08.418 --> 17:10.855
teachers talking about
cheating on their spouses..

17:10.942 --> 17:13.075
Um, what's that?

17:13.162 --> 17:15.904
All I'm saying is that chippy
I saw crossing out of here

17:15.991 --> 17:18.037
sure is playing with fire.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.690
Rebecca?
What are you talking about?

17:19.777 --> 17:24.086
- She's not married.
- No, but the principal is.

17:28.873 --> 17:30.701
She's doing it
with the principal?

17:30.788 --> 17:32.051
You didn't hear that from me

17:32.138 --> 17:35.576
and I didn't hear it
from the janitor.

17:35.663 --> 17:37.795
Well, I better shimmy
back down the totem pole.

17:37.882 --> 17:39.754
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

17:39.841 --> 17:42.452
Hey, what are you..
What are you doing?

17:42.539 --> 17:46.021
I thought we were gonna...
have some brownies.

17:46.108 --> 17:48.719
Doesn't strike me
as very professional.

17:48.806 --> 17:51.722
Oh, come on,
we're both off the clock

17:51.809 --> 17:54.421
and we're...family.

17:54.508 --> 17:58.164
Right? Mom?

18:01.819 --> 18:04.170
[instrumental music]

18:05.997 --> 18:08.739
Wait, are you saying that
distribution of school funds

18:08.826 --> 18:11.046
is decided by
the principal's secretary?

18:11.133 --> 18:12.091
Not officially.

18:12.178 --> 18:13.179
But she's definitely

18:13.266 --> 18:15.398
the blue-haired puppet master.

18:15.485 --> 18:18.662
Because she's got
the skinny on her boss.

18:18.749 --> 18:22.405
And by skinny,
I mean photos.

18:23.232 --> 18:25.408
Get out. Ugh!

18:27.106 --> 18:29.020
What do you hear about
the vice principal job?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.632
Am I still the front runner?

18:31.719 --> 18:35.418
Ah, that's enough
shop talk for one day.

18:35.505 --> 18:36.680
We can gab more on Sunday

18:36.767 --> 18:39.118
when you and Mikey
come over for dinner.

18:39.205 --> 18:41.903
Oh. Sunday,
mm, gosh, I think--

18:41.990 --> 18:43.774
I'll make a roast
and we can discuss

18:43.861 --> 18:46.125
you and Mikey
having a church wedding.

18:46.212 --> 18:48.953
We weren't planning on
a church wedding.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.999
And I wasn't planning
on serving goulash

18:51.086 --> 18:52.609
while wearing a wire.

18:52.696 --> 18:55.612
But if you want to dance,
you got to pay the Fiddler.

18:58.398 --> 19:00.313
I want to dance.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.793
[instrumental music]

19:07.581 --> 19:08.364
[both laughing]

19:08.451 --> 19:11.150
Oh, my God.

19:11.237 --> 19:12.890
[Molly]
'Oh, my God.'

19:12.977 --> 19:15.197
Hey.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.243
I think Jim's back down
to his fighting weight.

19:17.330 --> 19:21.812
He just took a dump so big
I thought it was another dog.

19:21.899 --> 19:23.510
By the way,
I talked to the priest

19:23.597 --> 19:26.556
at St. Bartholomew's
and you're good to go.

19:26.643 --> 19:29.646
Wait, we're having church
wedding? When did that happen?

19:29.733 --> 19:32.910
Since I accepted Jesus Christ
as my personal Lord and savior.

19:39.569 --> 19:41.310
And you know,
our little get-togethers

19:41.397 --> 19:43.312
don't have to be
just on a Sunday.

19:43.399 --> 19:44.661
Really?

19:44.748 --> 19:47.751
My Wednesdays
are pretty free, too.

19:47.838 --> 19:50.450
Okay, Peggy..

19:50.537 --> 19:53.540
I'm giving up Wednesdays,
dinner better be extra juicy.

19:53.627 --> 19:55.063
Oh, yeah.

19:55.150 --> 19:58.545
And afterwards, we can
look at some pictures.

19:58.632 --> 20:01.112
Ooh. Wednesday it is.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.639
You know,
I bowl on Wednesdays.

20:05.726 --> 20:07.902
Not anymore, you don't.

20:12.298 --> 20:15.214
[theme music]
