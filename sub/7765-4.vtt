AH. THANK YOU, MARGARET.
( SLURPS )

00:14.120 --> 00:16.180
HEY, MARGE, CAN YOU GET ME
A LATTE WHILE YOU'RE UP?

00:16.280 --> 00:17.900
PLEASE AND THANKS.
OF COURSE.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.540
NOW, I THINK YOU ALL KNOW
THAT EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU

00:20.640 --> 00:22.100
IS AN IMPORTANT PART
OF THIS TEAM.

00:22.200 --> 00:24.200
WHICH IS WHY
THIS LAST ANNOUNCEMENT

00:23.240 --> 00:24.740
IS FOR EVERYBODY HERE.

00:24.840 --> 00:27.860
CHANNEL 6 IS LOOKING FOR
A FRESH, EDGY NEWS SEGMENT,

00:27.960 --> 00:29.780
SOMETHING
WITH "WOW" FACTOR,

00:29.880 --> 00:32.300
SOMETHING THAT SCREAMS
WEEKLY.

00:32.400 --> 00:35.020
NOW, AS I SAID, THIS AUDITION
IS OPEN TO EVERYONE.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.460
JUST, UH, GIVE US YOUR FOOTAGE
IN THE NEXT THREE DAYS,

00:37.560 --> 00:40.140
AND THE PERSON WE CHOOSE
GETS THEIR OWN WEEKLY SEGMENT!

00:40.240 --> 00:41.860
HERE'S YOUR LATTE.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.900
OH, LIFEâSAVER.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.580
WELL, FRANK,
CHOPPER 6 HAS BEEN FUN,

00:45.680 --> 00:47.420
BUT IT MIGHT BE
JACKIE'S TIME TO SHINE.

00:47.520 --> 00:49.520
I AM GUNNING FOR
THAT WEEKLY NEWS SEGMENT.

00:49.400 --> 00:51.260
I MEAN (LAUGHS)
I'M CERTAINLY DESERVING OF IT,

00:51.360 --> 00:53.260
SEEING HOW I HAVE NEVER MISSED
A DAY OF WORK,

00:53.360 --> 00:55.100
NOT TO MENTION
THE TRAFFICâY AWARD I WON.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.140
WELL, I THINK MARGARET
WOULD HAVE A SHOT

00:57.240 --> 00:58.420
IF SHE TRIED OUT.
WHAT?!

00:58.520 --> 01:00.500
NO, I HAVEN'T EVEN
BEEN HERE THAT LONG.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.220
I MEAN,
IT WOULD BE AMAZING.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.940
BUT THERE'S NO WAY
I'M READY.

01:04.040 --> 01:06.180
YOU THINK I WAS READY
WHEN I STEPPED ON CHOPPER 6

01:06.280 --> 01:07.620
FOR THE FIRST TIME?

01:07.720 --> 01:10.060
I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
MY PILOT'S LICENSE,

01:10.160 --> 01:11.540
OR MY CONTACT LENSES,

01:11.640 --> 01:13.460
BUT I FLEW HER ANYWAY.

01:13.560 --> 01:16.420
DON'T STOP YOURSELF
FROM PURSUING YOUR DREAMS.

01:16.520 --> 01:18.660
WELL, I REALLY WOULD LIKE
THAT SEGMENT.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.380
WHAT'S THE HARM
IN TRYING?

01:20.480 --> 01:22.220
THAT'S MY GIRL!
( LAUGHS )

01:22.320 --> 01:25.740
BUT YOU HAVE YOUR LICENSE NOW,
RIGHT?
LET'S GO HOME.

01:25.840 --> 01:27.840
WELL, THERE COULD BE
PLENTY HARM IN TRYING.

01:27.520 --> 01:29.520
FRANK, FRANK?

01:29.920 --> 01:31.740
OKAY, SO THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING

01:31.840 --> 01:33.840
WITH A "WOW" FACTOR.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.980
YOU GUYS HAVE ANY IDEAS
THAT ARE, LIKE, "WOW!"?

01:37.080 --> 01:39.740
MAYBE GO CEREBRAL,
LIKE WITH A THINK PIECE.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.260
MAYBE SOMETHING LIKE,
"HMM," YOU KNOW?

01:42.360 --> 01:43.980
'KAY.

01:44.080 --> 01:46.100
WHAT ELSE MAKES YOU GUYS
WANT TO WATCH THE NEWS?

01:46.200 --> 01:47.860
THE CAR CHASES!
YEAH.

01:47.960 --> 01:49.460
AND, THEN,
WHEN THE COPS ARE ALL LIKE...

01:49.560 --> 01:50.980

"OUT OF THE CAR, DIRTBAG!"

01:51.080 --> 01:52.140
( BOTH IMITATE GUNFIRE )

01:52.240 --> 01:53.780
YEAH, DIRTBAGS ââ
THAT'S IT!

01:53.880 --> 01:55.060
I'LL GO UNDERCOVER

01:55.160 --> 01:57.160
TO CATCH ALL OF THE DIRTBAGS
AROUND THE CITY.

01:57.040 --> 01:58.860
Smith:
UNDERCOVER REPORTER?

01:58.960 --> 02:01.300
YEAH, LIKE WITH DISGUISES
AND HIDDEN CAMERAS.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.740
I WANT MY SEGMENT
TO REALLY HELP PEOPLE, YOU KNOW?

02:03.840 --> 02:08.500
I'LL CALL IT "MARGARET ALWAYS
MARâGETS THE BAD GUY."

02:08.600 --> 02:09.940
I'M NOT LOVING THE NAME,

02:10.040 --> 02:12.260
BUT I LOVE SEEING
THAT FIRE IN YOU, ANGEL.

02:12.360 --> 02:14.300
SAY, FRANK,
LAST TIME I CHECKED,

02:14.400 --> 02:17.080
THE MORTALITY RATES FOR
UNDERCOVER REPORTERS
WAS, UH, PRETTY HIGH.

02:17.160 --> 02:19.940
YOU SURE YOU WANT TO
SEND YOUR LITTLE ANGEL
OUT INTO THAT MESS?

02:20.040 --> 02:22.860
IT MAY BE A LITTLE DANGEROUS,
BUT I BELIEVE IN MARGARET.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.860
YOU KNOW, THE STATION HAS
AN ANONYMOUSâTIP HOTLINE.

02:25.960 --> 02:28.780
I THINK THAT WILL GIVE YOU
A LEG UP ON YOUR STORY.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.980
YEAH, THAT HOTLINE
GAVE ME A GOOD TIP

02:31.080 --> 02:33.260
ON STEROID USE
IN THAT CURLING CHAMPIONSHIP.

02:33.360 --> 02:36.120
IT GETS
THE DEL SEAL OF APPROVAL.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.120
OH, DEL,
YOU HAVE DONE IT AGAIN.

THIS IS A CORPORATE EâMAIL
STRAIGHT FROM THE TOP.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.780
YOU EVER HEARD OF
A VEGETARIAN SANDWICH

03:13.880 --> 03:15.300
WITH MEAT IN IT?
WHAT?!

03:15.400 --> 03:17.540
THE CHEESE

OH, WE DO, MA'AM.

03:29.800 --> 03:32.820
I CAN'T WAIT TO EAT ONE OF
THOSE VEGETARIAN SANDWICHES.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.580
SAY, YOU HAVEN'T STARTED
PUTTING MEAT IN THOSE,

03:35.680 --> 03:37.540
HAVE YOU?
OH, UH, NO, MA'AM.

'CAUSE THIS SAYS DIFFERENTLY.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.420

DO YOU WANT TO ADD
SOME JALAPEÃO ZINGERS

03:47.320 --> 03:49.580
AND MAKE IT A MEAL?
WHAT?! NO!

03:53.920 --> 03:55.420
HEY, LET ME SEE THIS.

03:55.520 --> 03:57.520
OH, YOU SHOULD
CHECK YOUR SOURCES, LADY.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.500
THIS IS
A PRETTY OLD CAMPAIGN.

03:58.600 --> 03:59.580
SEE?

03:59.680 --> 04:01.540
"CHEEZER'S
USES GRADEâA MEAT...

04:01.640 --> 04:03.660

04:03.760 --> 04:05.220
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU FELL FOR THAT!

04:05.320 --> 04:07.320
( LAUGHTER )
NEXT.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.900
( GROANS )
THAT WAS SO EMBARRASSING.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.660
I'LL HAVE TO GO TO THAT

It's me.
YOU!

04:15.280 --> 04:16.660
THIS BETTER BE GOOD.

04:16.760 --> 04:18.820
YOUR LAST TIP WAS A BUST.
CHEEZER'S WAS CLEAN.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.620
That's what
they want you to think.

04:20.720 --> 04:22.720
Anyway,
forget about Cheezer's.

04:22.040 --> 04:23.500
I've got something better.

04:23.600 --> 04:26.260
Tomorrow at 10:00.
You know where to find me.

04:34.080 --> 04:35.980

WELL,
WORD ON THE STREET IS

04:36.080 --> 04:37.700
IS THAT
THE LOCAL PARK MANAGER

04:37.800 --> 04:38.940
IS USING TAXPAYER MONEY

04:39.040 --> 04:41.660
TO RUN A GAMBLING RING
INSIDE THE PARK.

04:41.760 --> 04:43.420
OKAY, NOW YOU'RE <i>DEFINITELY</i>
WRONG.

04:43.520 --> 04:44.380
I KNOW THOSE GUYS,

04:44.480 --> 04:45.540
AND THERE'S NO WAY

04:45.640 --> 04:47.640
THEY'RE RUNNING
A GAMBLING RING.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.100
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

04:48.200 --> 04:50.200
WELL,
MAYBE YOU'LL BELIEVE THIS.

04:51.480 --> 04:53.960
FOLLOW THE MONEY.

04:54.960 --> 04:57.460

THE BEST GAMBLER IN TOWN.

05:04.520 --> 05:07.020
HO, HO, HO!
DOES HE COUNT CARDS?

05:07.120 --> 05:08.940
DOES A FULL HOUSE
BEAT A STRAIGHT?

05:22.400 --> 05:23.780
I DIDN'T
WANT TO BELIEVE IT,

05:23.880 --> 05:25.880
BUT YOU TWO ARE RUNNING
AN ILLEGAL GAMBLING RING

05:25.400 --> 05:26.660

TOLD YOU THE PARK DOESN'T

BELIEVING THAT TIP.

06:00.200 --> 06:01.300
NOW WHAT DO I DO?

06:01.400 --> 06:03.060
MAYBE YOU COULD DO
A SIMPLER SEGMENT,

06:03.160 --> 06:04.140
LIKE A COOKING SHOW.

06:04.240 --> 06:06.240
YOU MAKE
A MEAN POUND CAKE.

WELL, YOU DID GREAT.

10:21.120 --> 10:23.120
