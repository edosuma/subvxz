00:01.540 --> 00:04.250
Previously on "How To Get Away
With Murder"...

00:04.250 --> 00:05.170
Jorge Castillo, I have
a warrant for your arrest.

00:05.170 --> 00:06.540
I heard you took
Crawford's place

00:06.540 --> 00:08.080
as the new
managing partner, right?

00:08.080 --> 00:09.830
Convenient.
You think I had
something to do with this?

00:09.830 --> 00:10.830
I didn't say that.

00:10.830 --> 00:12.710
Then be smart
and stop talking.

00:12.710 --> 00:14.000
Who is he?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.580
Frank: Vivian's boyfriend
until he O.D.'d on oxy.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.670
Telesco's gonna say that
my mom gave him the drugs.

00:18.670 --> 00:19.920
If she finds out
the truth...

00:19.920 --> 00:21.500
Wait, y-you did this?

00:21.500 --> 00:24.710
No UVA law student
has time to watch TV --

00:24.710 --> 00:26.380
unless you dropped out
on me.
Gabriel: 'Course not.

00:26.380 --> 00:27.460
Laurel needs us.

00:27.460 --> 00:28.670
Annalise:
No, she's never needed us.

00:28.670 --> 00:29.960
No, I'm going to the police
to report her missing.

00:29.960 --> 00:31.380
That's already happened,
Michaela.

00:31.380 --> 00:33.250
Frank and Bonnie are
with the police right now.

00:33.250 --> 00:35.960
We're gonna beat out
all of the guilt

00:35.960 --> 00:39.120
and the shame and the lies
and the fear.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.620
Annalise knew
your birth father.

00:40.620 --> 00:42.830
If that's true,
I'm gonna kill you.

00:51.210 --> 00:52.790
Welcome
to the new semester,

00:52.790 --> 00:54.920
which is your last semester
of law school.

00:54.920 --> 00:58.330
From here on out, you will be
taking point on your cases.

00:58.330 --> 01:01.790
I'm just here to give you enough
rope to hang yourselves with.

01:01.790 --> 01:05.210
Our first client --
Hector Diaz.

01:05.210 --> 01:07.880
He crossed the border illegally
from Sinaloa, Mexico,

01:07.880 --> 01:09.670
and now wants asylum.

01:09.670 --> 01:13.120
Be ready to pitch your strategy
at C&G in two hours.

01:13.120 --> 01:15.210
Class dismissed.
Professor Keating, wait.

01:15.210 --> 01:17.080
Uh, there's a rumor that
Laurel Castillo dropped out.

01:17.080 --> 01:19.040
Shouldn't someone
get her seat?

01:19.040 --> 01:21.580
Also Michaela Pratt.
She's not here, either.

01:24.750 --> 01:27.420
Annalise: I didn't know
your father, Michaela.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.580
It says right here you did.

01:28.580 --> 01:30.080
I was an intern on his case.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.420
-That means you knew him.
-No --

01:31.420 --> 01:32.500
You're not making
any sense!

01:32.500 --> 01:36.000
Listen, put that down,
and I'll explain.

01:38.210 --> 01:39.920
I was an undergrad
at Tennessee,

01:39.920 --> 01:41.880
volunteering at the law firm
that was defending him.

01:41.880 --> 01:43.580
Is this the same story
you told Wes?

01:43.580 --> 01:46.500
Listen --
I'm part of your pathetic
kid rescue collection?

01:46.500 --> 01:48.790
I didn't know who you were
until we picked the K5.

01:48.790 --> 01:49.960
Oh, it was a coincidence --

01:49.960 --> 01:51.040
that's what you expect me
to believe?!

01:51.040 --> 01:52.330
No, I never told you
because I knew

01:52.330 --> 01:53.460
it wasn't the story
you wanted to hear.

01:53.460 --> 01:54.790
All I ever want
is for you to be honest!

01:54.790 --> 01:57.210
No, you want me to make sense
out of your pain,

01:57.210 --> 01:58.500
to say that
I knew your father

01:58.500 --> 02:00.380
and that there was a good reason
why he gave you up,

02:00.380 --> 02:03.000
and I wish I could give
that to you, Michaela.

02:03.000 --> 02:04.540
I do,
but I didn't know the man.

02:04.540 --> 02:08.750
He was a stranger to me,
just like he is to you.

02:08.750 --> 02:10.330
I'm sorry.

02:17.750 --> 02:21.670
I'm just sorry
you're so dumb

02:21.670 --> 02:23.790
that you think
I'd believe you...

02:27.540 --> 02:28.790
...bitch.

02:28.790 --> 02:30.750
Annalise:
Ms. Pratt is out sick.

02:30.750 --> 02:33.710
The free seat goes to the
student who came the closest

02:33.710 --> 02:35.790
to getting it last semester --
Asher Millstone.

02:35.790 --> 02:37.420
Yes!
Sweet baby Jesus.

02:37.420 --> 02:39.500
Study up on the client.
I'll see you at C&G.

02:41.920 --> 02:43.500
Where is she?

02:43.500 --> 02:44.750
At home,
boycotting you.

02:44.750 --> 02:47.040
And stabbing
her AK voodoo doll.

02:47.040 --> 02:50.330
You can't expect us to buy
that this was all a coincidence.

02:50.330 --> 02:52.670
It was.
And what's my coincidence?

02:52.670 --> 02:54.000
You never explained to me
why you picked me for the K5.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.710
Because
you're my secret baby.

02:57.710 --> 03:00.040
You all are.

03:01.420 --> 03:05.080
Here, the first reference
I found of a Dwight Halpern

03:05.080 --> 03:08.330
is in Dixon Correctional
Institute in '91 --

03:08.330 --> 03:09.500
Right after
my birth mother was shot.

03:09.500 --> 03:12.120
Then he got transferred
in 2001 to BB Rayburn.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.710
So he's still
in Louisiana?

03:13.710 --> 03:15.210
I'm checking.

03:15.210 --> 03:19.620
Or we could just
quit this right now.

03:19.620 --> 03:21.380
I mean,
he shot your mom.

03:21.380 --> 03:22.580
That's just the story
I was told.

03:22.580 --> 03:24.330
He went to jail for it.

03:24.330 --> 03:26.960
Like innocent black men
don't go to jail all the time.

03:26.960 --> 03:28.380
There! That's him.

03:28.380 --> 03:31.290
Orleans Parish Prison,
2001 to 2005.

03:31.290 --> 03:33.040
Mm. There's no records
after that,

03:33.040 --> 03:35.620
so maybe
he got released.

03:35.620 --> 03:36.620
No.

03:36.620 --> 03:37.710
What? Are --
Are you sure?

03:37.710 --> 03:40.120
Maybe he got out
on good behavior.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.330
They lost him in Katrina.

03:41.330 --> 03:43.170
Who?
My father.

03:43.170 --> 03:44.540
There's no sign of him
after 2005

03:44.540 --> 03:46.750
because his records
got destroyed in Katrina.

03:46.750 --> 03:47.790
Unless you
disappeared him?

03:47.790 --> 03:49.170
Stop this.
Why?

03:49.170 --> 03:50.420
So I don't find out
the real reason

03:50.420 --> 03:51.790
you've been lying to me
this whole time?

03:51.790 --> 03:54.460
You can be angry with me,
but you can't miss class.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.210
That's what you're mad about?

03:56.210 --> 03:57.620
Fail me.

03:57.620 --> 03:59.460
Oh, you think I won't?
Do it.

03:59.460 --> 04:00.790
Then I'll go to
the disciplinary board

04:00.790 --> 04:02.250
and tell them
about your little relapse.

04:02.250 --> 04:04.210
I'm trying to have
an adult conversation with you.

04:04.210 --> 04:06.120
Adult this.

04:08.080 --> 04:10.580
Who'd you piss off
this time?

04:24.380 --> 04:26.210
The hell
is wrong with you?

04:26.210 --> 04:27.960
Stole my husband and now
you got to take my son, too?

04:27.960 --> 04:29.790
No, this was all Gabriel.

04:29.790 --> 04:33.380
But you knew he was lying to me
this entire time.

04:33.380 --> 04:35.420
I had to drive to UVA,
thinking I'd surprise him,

04:35.420 --> 04:36.580
only to find out
he's here with you?

04:36.580 --> 04:37.830
Let's go somewhere
and talk.

04:37.830 --> 04:39.830
No, you argued a case
in front of the Supreme Court.

04:39.830 --> 04:41.250
You can handle
fighting me in public.

04:41.250 --> 04:42.620
No. I don't want to
fight at all.

04:42.620 --> 04:45.620
Too late. I'm here.
I'm ready.

04:45.620 --> 04:48.210
I didn't know Gabriel existed
until he showed up here.

04:48.210 --> 04:49.380
I didn't know Sam knew
he existed.

04:49.380 --> 04:52.620
Oh, Sam knew.
He absolutely knew.

04:52.620 --> 04:54.420
You want to know
when he found out?
I don't.

04:54.420 --> 04:56.210
The same night he stood
in our living room

04:56.210 --> 04:58.790
and announced
he was leaving me for you.

04:58.790 --> 05:01.880
He shocked me with that news,
so I shocked his ass right back.

05:01.880 --> 05:04.250
And I knew exactly
how our man would react.

05:04.250 --> 05:05.830
Didn't disappoint,
either.

05:05.830 --> 05:08.040
He said, "Never mind,"

05:08.040 --> 05:11.330
he'd tell you
it was over.

05:11.330 --> 05:15.620
That's right.
He chose me.

05:15.620 --> 05:18.580
I just wasn't pathetic enough
to take him back.

05:23.210 --> 05:25.000
So you lied to your son
about his father.

05:25.000 --> 05:26.170
He's angry about that.

05:26.170 --> 05:29.330
If you want him back,
talk to him.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.500
Did you kill Sam?

05:34.750 --> 05:37.830
I've never killed anyone
in my life, but try me.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.080
How can I help you?

05:48.080 --> 05:50.670
Here.

05:52.210 --> 05:54.380
My fiancÃ©e,
Laurel Castillo --

05:54.380 --> 05:56.710
she's missing,
and the police have no leads.

05:56.710 --> 05:58.330
My God.
I'm so sorry.

05:58.330 --> 06:02.000
I found this
in her jewelry.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.080
It's -- It's one of yours,
right?

06:04.080 --> 06:05.670
Opens a safe deposit box?

06:05.670 --> 06:07.580
Are -- Are you listed
on the account?

06:07.580 --> 06:09.380
You think
I'd be asking if I was?

06:09.380 --> 06:12.580
Uh, sorry. Dumb question.
It's just...

06:12.580 --> 06:16.210
I'm begging you,
Rachael.

06:27.960 --> 06:30.750
Yes. Laurel Castillo's
one of the access-holders.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.210
One of them?

06:32.210 --> 06:34.210
There's another
family member listed.

06:34.210 --> 06:36.620
Uh, her mother, Sandrine?
Xavier?

06:36.620 --> 06:38.170
Without
proof of your relationship,

06:38.170 --> 06:39.960
I can't tell you
anything else.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.120
So sorry.

06:44.750 --> 06:46.580
Temporary
protected status.

06:46.580 --> 06:48.290
Where's Mr. Maddox?
Who cares?

06:48.290 --> 06:49.880
I just gave you the perfect
strategy for this case.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.460
Uh, a better strategy's
arguing Mr. Diaz

06:51.460 --> 06:53.080
was persecuted
because of his race.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.040
You mean the gang violence
that's rampant

06:54.040 --> 06:55.580
in Sinaloa right now.

06:55.580 --> 06:57.170
Gang violence is a stereotype
about the region.

06:57.170 --> 06:58.580
Clearly, this should
disqualify Mr. Walsh.

06:58.580 --> 06:59.580
-Mr. Walsh wins.
-What? Bull donks!

06:59.580 --> 07:01.040
-His idea sucks!
-Seriously?

07:01.040 --> 07:02.500
I need this more than him.
I missed a whole semester.

07:02.500 --> 07:04.290
Fine, Mr. Millstone
is second chair.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.670
Mr. Maddox, my office.

07:10.120 --> 07:12.290
Your mother's here.

07:12.290 --> 07:14.960
What?
Yeah. She stopped me on campus.

07:14.960 --> 07:16.080
You swear
you didn't know?

07:16.080 --> 07:18.210
No, of course not.
I had no clue.

07:18.210 --> 07:19.830
Why wouldn't she tell me
she was here?

07:19.830 --> 07:21.750
Well, she's your mother,
not mine.

07:21.750 --> 07:24.120
What did she say?
These are questions
for her, Gabriel,

07:24.120 --> 07:25.040
so go and talk to her.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.920
Look who's got
that Cali glow.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.080
Well, that's menopause,
girl.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.120
I'll take it.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.540
You on hot flashes is better
than every male partner

07:40.540 --> 07:42.540
giving me side-eye
like I stole their birthright.

07:42.540 --> 07:44.540
Really, all I stole
was a dead man's office...

07:44.540 --> 07:47.880
...which, let me tell you,
is still giving me the creeps.

07:49.040 --> 07:51.710
Hey.
I'm your boss now.

07:51.710 --> 07:53.250
I'll cut off the funds
to your clinic if you
don't listen to me.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.460
Well, I'm sorry.
I have to go.

07:55.460 --> 07:58.830
What's going on?

07:58.830 --> 08:00.330
Sam's ex is in town.

08:00.330 --> 08:02.620
Oh.
Why is that a thing?

08:02.620 --> 08:05.040
Everything dealing with Sam
is a thing.

08:05.040 --> 08:08.540
I'll be a better employee
tomorrow.

08:08.540 --> 08:12.080
I was looking for a friend
more than an employee.

08:15.750 --> 08:18.120
You ready to rock,
Bette Davis?
Is that a gay joke?

08:18.120 --> 08:20.120
It's an "All About Eve" joke,
'cause the understudy here

08:20.120 --> 08:21.500
is about to become
the star of this case.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.500
I'm so confused.

08:22.500 --> 08:23.710
I'm stealing
our client from you.

08:23.710 --> 08:25.500
Consider it nice
I gave you a warning.

08:30.380 --> 08:33.380
I'm sorry.
W-Where's my client?

08:43.750 --> 08:46.960
Uh...
T-Tu, Hector.

08:46.960 --> 08:50.170
Tu in, uh -- uh, U.S.A.

08:50.170 --> 08:52.290
Uh, duh --
Tu parentes, dÃ³nde --

08:52.290 --> 08:55.670
Are they,
um...in Mexico?

08:55.670 --> 08:57.540
Uh...

09:02.040 --> 09:06.000
Did Annalise tell you to do that
just to torture me?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.170
Bonnie: You think
she was wearing a wire?

09:09.170 --> 09:11.580
Of course,
for the FBI, Hannah --

09:11.580 --> 09:13.580
Or the Governor.
Take your pick.

09:13.580 --> 09:16.000
Here, this is everything
Frank found on Vivian.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.420
I would ask him to get more,
but he's MIA.

09:18.420 --> 09:20.750
Please tell me he's not doing
something stupid.
I'll find him.

09:20.750 --> 09:21.830
Good, and find
something on Vivian

09:21.830 --> 09:23.210
to scare her back
to Chicago.

09:23.210 --> 09:24.620
On it.

09:24.620 --> 09:26.620
Wait.
You both wanna see this.

09:28.040 --> 09:29.250
It's from 10 years ago,

09:29.250 --> 09:30.540
when Tegan was at
C&G's Mexico office.

09:30.540 --> 09:33.620
So?
It's the same year Laurel
was kidnapped.

09:33.620 --> 09:36.040
C&G got her released.
Tegan negotiated that?

09:36.040 --> 09:38.330
Not sure, but I just want us all
to keep a closer eye on her.

09:38.330 --> 09:41.080
No, you want me
to start drinking again.

09:41.080 --> 09:42.670
Shoulda stayed in Malibu.

09:47.330 --> 09:48.920
Where's Annalise?
Oh, she's not here.

09:48.920 --> 09:51.330
You said this was
an Annalise emergency.
Yeah, it is.

09:51.330 --> 09:53.040
The emergency is that she's not
answering her phone.

09:53.040 --> 09:55.250
Look, Connor and I,
we need a translator,

09:55.250 --> 09:56.420
and since you say "Castillo"
so well --

09:56.420 --> 09:58.250
I'm the managing partner
of a giant law firm.

09:58.250 --> 10:00.830
You think I have time
to be your translator?
I mean, you should.

10:00.830 --> 10:01.960
At least, if you want to meet
your pro-bono hours requirement.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.000
Uh...

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
Our client is 8 years old
and he's very, very adorable!

10:07.500 --> 10:10.120
When's his hearing?
Connor: Two days.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.120
I'm planning on arguing for
asylum due to gang violence.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.920
Connor's idea.
It's lame, right?

10:13.920 --> 10:15.710
Okay, well, no strategy
will work if he doesn't

10:15.710 --> 10:17.210
tell us anything,
is the point.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.620
Wait,
w-w-what's he drawing?

10:29.170 --> 10:30.620
Â¿SÃ­?

10:36.250 --> 10:38.080
It's a gang member.

10:38.080 --> 10:39.210
If we show this
to the judge,

10:39.210 --> 10:41.210
it'll show he's been
oppressed by violence.

10:53.210 --> 10:57.620
We got a gang,
just not the right one.

10:57.620 --> 11:00.460
Vivian: It's Vivian.
Hit me at the beep.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.960
You dead in a ditch somewhere?

11:02.960 --> 11:03.920
That's the only excuse
I'm taking for you

11:03.920 --> 11:06.500
not calling me back.

11:16.380 --> 11:18.210
I hate you for convincing me
to find my father,

11:18.210 --> 11:19.750
because -- found him.
Well, sort of.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.460
He's lost in the system.

11:21.460 --> 11:23.250
And even though I want to
go back to not caring about

11:23.250 --> 11:25.170
finding him, you put it
in my head that I should,

11:25.170 --> 11:26.380
which means that all
the frustration

11:26.380 --> 11:27.620
that I'm feeling
is your fault.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.380
Mm.

11:29.380 --> 11:31.880
Michaela --
Unh-unh. Pants off right now.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.250
My mom is here.
Oh, my God. Where?

11:34.250 --> 11:39.040
Not here in the apartment.
Here in town.

11:39.040 --> 11:41.670
How mad is she?

11:41.670 --> 11:45.250
Mad enough that she won't
return my calls.

11:45.250 --> 11:48.710
I only know she's here
because of Annalise.

11:48.710 --> 11:51.040
What?
She went to her first,
which is crazy,

11:51.040 --> 11:53.040
but that's my mom
for you.

11:54.670 --> 11:58.880
Well...since
we're both stressed.

11:58.880 --> 12:01.170
Perfect.

12:07.500 --> 12:09.330
Vivian: Gabriel.

12:09.330 --> 12:10.540
Oh, my God.
Get up, get up,
get up, get up, get up.

12:10.540 --> 12:11.540
I hear you.

12:11.540 --> 12:12.960
One minute!

12:12.960 --> 12:14.670
Boy, open this door.

12:17.750 --> 12:20.750
Hi. Uh, Ms. Maddox.

12:20.750 --> 12:22.120
Michaela. Pratt.

12:22.120 --> 12:24.170
So lovely to finally
meet you.

12:24.170 --> 12:25.750
You live in this apartment,
Michaela?

12:25.750 --> 12:26.960
Uh --

12:26.960 --> 12:28.420
No. I-I have a house
of my own.

12:28.420 --> 12:29.620
I mean, I share it,
I don't own it.

12:29.620 --> 12:31.830
Thank God.
It's kind of gross.

12:31.830 --> 12:34.790
How about you go to that gross
house so I can talk to my son?

12:34.790 --> 12:37.790
Of course.
Uh, just lovely to...

12:37.790 --> 12:40.210
Thank you. Okay.

12:42.250 --> 12:43.880
Connor:
You drunk this morning?

12:43.880 --> 12:46.670
Is that why you forgot to tell
us that our client's a child?

12:46.670 --> 12:49.040
Or is this some hint about why
you picked me for the K5?

12:49.040 --> 12:50.330
Hector's my brother
or something.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.960
Attorneys get incomplete
case files all the time.

12:51.960 --> 12:54.080
They only meet their clients
on the first day of court.

12:54.080 --> 12:56.500
You're lucky I let you
meet Hector before.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.080
So figure out this
impossible case on my own,

12:58.080 --> 13:00.670
is what you're saying?
Like an actual lawyer. Go.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.670
Tell us what's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.

13:03.670 --> 13:05.460
Okay, literally every time
you've ever said that to us,

13:05.460 --> 13:07.040
something has been very,
very wrong.

13:09.710 --> 13:11.580
Vivian's here.

13:13.170 --> 13:15.170
Gabriel: Why didn't you pick up
any of my calls?

13:15.170 --> 13:17.580
I was running around a city
I don't know. My phone died.

13:17.580 --> 13:19.290
So not because you were off
high with some guy?

13:19.290 --> 13:21.330
Gabriel Vincent Maddox --

13:21.330 --> 13:22.710
Just tell me why you went
to Annalise before me.

13:22.710 --> 13:25.120
Because I assumed you'd lied,
just like you've been lying

13:25.120 --> 13:26.330
about being with her
this whole time.

13:26.330 --> 13:29.710
She's my professor, Ma.
I'm not with her.

13:29.710 --> 13:30.790
Ain't that a relief.

13:30.790 --> 13:32.290
God knows
it crossed my mind

13:32.290 --> 13:34.040
considering her
previous behavior.

13:34.040 --> 13:35.830
Don't make this about her.
He left you.

13:35.830 --> 13:37.540
Sam. That's who
you should blame.

13:37.540 --> 13:39.380
I'll blame them both,
especially now

13:39.380 --> 13:40.960
that she's brainwashing
my son.

13:40.960 --> 13:42.420
I came here for answers.
That's all.

13:42.420 --> 13:43.620
Answers I could have
given you.

13:43.620 --> 13:45.460
You lied to me
about this my whole life.

13:45.460 --> 13:47.040
I always said your father
stepped out on us.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.540
Where's the lie in that?
You said he never came back
to see me again.

13:49.540 --> 13:50.790
That's true.
He didn't.

13:50.790 --> 13:53.620
I met him...Ma.

13:56.460 --> 13:58.210
When I was 11 years old,
he came to see us.

14:03.380 --> 14:04.960
Grandma?

14:04.960 --> 14:06.380
Gabriel?

14:06.380 --> 14:08.210
Get in here right now.

14:08.210 --> 14:09.670
Gabriel:
Grandma never told you?

14:11.670 --> 14:12.830
No.

14:12.830 --> 14:14.460
Be honest.

14:16.710 --> 14:18.330
I never knew.

14:18.330 --> 14:20.670
I'll swear
on the damn Bible.

14:20.670 --> 14:25.250
Baby, I never meant for you
to find out this way.

14:25.250 --> 14:26.670
You never meant for me
to find out at all.

14:26.670 --> 14:31.830
Because I knew you'd be hurt,
and look at you now.

14:31.830 --> 14:38.420
The truth? I kept him
from you because...

14:38.420 --> 14:41.620
he wasn't a good man,
for either of us,

14:41.620 --> 14:43.620
and that is no way
for you to grow up --

14:43.620 --> 14:47.040
learning how to be a man
from a bad one.

14:47.040 --> 14:50.040
Maybe that's wrong.
I'm sorry.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.170
But I'm here now, and I'll tell
you whatever you want to know

14:52.170 --> 14:54.920
about the man --
good, bad, ugly.

14:56.540 --> 14:58.380
Just don't shut me out,
baby.

15:00.830 --> 15:03.000
I think you should go.
Over my dead body.

15:03.000 --> 15:05.250
Gab--
I just need some time.

15:05.250 --> 15:07.290
What you need to do
is talk to me, baby.

15:07.290 --> 15:08.620
I'm not your baby!

15:08.620 --> 15:11.750
I'm a grown-ass man,
and I got this way despite you,

15:11.750 --> 15:12.830
not because of you.

15:22.670 --> 15:25.040
Did she seem
like a drug addict?

15:25.040 --> 15:26.040
She seemed like a mom.

15:26.040 --> 15:27.880
Like a moley mom?
What?

15:27.880 --> 15:31.670
Uh, she's probably a mole
for the FBI like her moley son.

15:31.670 --> 15:34.830
Shut up with that.
Yeah, there's no way
that Sam's first wife showing up

15:34.830 --> 15:38.380
at the exact moment the FBI's
stalking all of us is bad news.

15:38.380 --> 15:39.500
Not at all.

15:39.500 --> 15:41.120
Maybe she just came here
to visit her son

15:41.120 --> 15:42.830
who she loves
and misses.

15:44.790 --> 15:46.830
Never mind.
That was the old me talking.

15:48.120 --> 15:51.710
Okay. I have something
to confess,

15:51.710 --> 15:54.500
but promise
no telling Annalise.

15:54.500 --> 15:56.000
Gabey's a mole?
He's not a mole.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.580
He just...

16:05.880 --> 16:09.250
He kind of told me
he killed his mom's boyfriend.

16:25.880 --> 16:28.880
Hey.
Where are you?

16:28.880 --> 16:30.460
Pittsburgh. Dad's in trouble
with some bookie.

16:30.460 --> 16:31.670
I'm helping him out.

16:31.670 --> 16:34.080
Well, I need your help.
Vivian's here.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.500
Are you serious?
Yeah.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.330
Annalise gave me the file
you put together on her.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.880
What's this sealed file
in her arrest report?

16:40.880 --> 16:42.040
I never found out.

16:42.040 --> 16:44.080
Do you think you can?

16:44.080 --> 16:46.750
I'll look into it.
Gotta go.

17:01.710 --> 17:05.880
I'm here for Laurel.
I can't not know anymore...

17:05.880 --> 17:09.750
if she's...okay.

17:09.750 --> 17:13.120
Just tell me
she's safe.

17:13.120 --> 17:14.170
What is this?

17:14.170 --> 17:17.000
Some game
to make me believe

17:17.000 --> 17:18.000
that you don't know
where she is?

17:18.000 --> 17:20.040
I don't.
Neither do I.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.210
Told the FBI
the same thing.

17:21.210 --> 17:23.120
Xavier took her.
We both know that.

17:23.120 --> 17:24.250
Don't come here again.

17:27.830 --> 17:30.500
Help me find her.

17:36.710 --> 17:37.750
I found him.
Oliver!

17:37.750 --> 17:39.960
I did some old-school
library hacking

17:39.960 --> 17:41.710
and found a newsletter
from a prison in Virginia

17:41.710 --> 17:43.540
that mentions your dad.

17:43.540 --> 17:47.420
Listen -- "Inmate D. Halpern
received the Warden's Award

17:47.420 --> 17:49.380
for starting an online
charity that supports

17:49.380 --> 17:50.830
domestic abuse victims."

17:50.830 --> 17:52.420
A charity.
It shows he's reformed.

17:52.420 --> 17:54.210
We don't know
that that's him.
But we do.

17:54.210 --> 17:56.210
Oliver.

17:56.210 --> 17:58.000
He has your eyes.

18:06.330 --> 18:10.330
It's to a safe deposit box
in Laurel's name.

18:10.330 --> 18:12.420
She shares it
with a family member.

18:12.420 --> 18:13.830
Is it you?

18:13.830 --> 18:15.040
No.

18:15.040 --> 18:18.460
Sandrine? Xavier?

18:20.670 --> 18:22.500
I get it.

18:22.500 --> 18:26.330
That hurt you feel,
that kick in your heart?

18:26.330 --> 18:27.920
I've been living
with that pain every day

18:27.920 --> 18:29.540
since Laurel
was a child.

18:29.540 --> 18:32.670
Think about
how scary that is.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.880
You wake up one day
to find out just how much

18:34.880 --> 18:38.040
your own daughter
hates you.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.080
I still don't get why.

18:40.080 --> 18:43.710
I just know that she wanted
to punish me, and it worked.

18:43.710 --> 18:45.540
Look where I am now.

18:45.540 --> 18:46.920
You did this to yourself.

18:46.920 --> 18:50.540
No. Laurel did this.

18:50.540 --> 18:54.170
And she's probably
got the same plan for you,

18:54.170 --> 18:57.290
Annalise, and whoever else
she's talking to the FBI about.

19:00.420 --> 19:03.670
The biggest tragedy
in all this?

19:03.670 --> 19:06.120
Christopher.

19:06.120 --> 19:08.500
I tried to save him,
to keep her from destroying him

19:08.500 --> 19:10.500
like every other man
in her life -- me, Dominick,

19:10.500 --> 19:14.170
Wes...and now you.

19:14.170 --> 19:17.120
You want to worry
about someone?

19:17.120 --> 19:20.080
Worry about
that sweet little boy.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.710
Asher:
We say Hector's covered

19:28.710 --> 19:30.540
by the Trafficking Victims
Protection Act.

19:30.540 --> 19:31.710
Annalise: Well,
what was he trafficked for?

19:31.710 --> 19:33.040
House cleaning?
Sex work?

19:33.040 --> 19:35.460
If you don't know, you can't
prove improper purpose.

19:35.460 --> 19:37.000
Then we try to use DACA.
He's too young for DACA.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.620
I got it. Here.

19:38.620 --> 19:41.000
We, uh --
We get Hector to redraw this

19:41.000 --> 19:42.380
without
the ICE letters.

19:42.380 --> 19:44.170
That way, we prove
that he experienced

19:44.170 --> 19:45.670
violent persecution
at home.

19:45.670 --> 19:48.170
You're gonna coach a small child
to offer doctored testimony?

19:48.170 --> 19:49.790
You would do it.
Well, I'm good enough
not to get caught.

19:49.790 --> 19:51.210
You're not.

19:51.210 --> 19:53.750
You're all a disappointment.
Class dismissed.

19:53.750 --> 19:55.040
Gabriel.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.250
You're going home.
Excuse me?

20:02.250 --> 20:05.830
Not to your apartment, but back
to Chicago with your mother.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.000
That's not your decision.

20:07.000 --> 20:08.830
Think about our client.

20:08.830 --> 20:11.580
That boy probably wants nothing
more than to be with his family,

20:11.580 --> 20:13.580
and here you are
throwing yours away.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.420
She threw away my chance
to know my father.

20:15.420 --> 20:18.040
Then forgive her.
I mean it, Gabriel.

20:18.040 --> 20:19.620
Listen,
she made one big mistake,

20:19.620 --> 20:20.960
but she gave you
your life.

20:20.960 --> 20:22.330
She was high
most of my life.

20:22.330 --> 20:25.170
Because she was in pain,
just like you are right now.

20:25.170 --> 20:28.080
So go and be the man you keep
saying you want to be

20:28.080 --> 20:29.880
and forgive her.

20:31.960 --> 20:34.170
You know you want to.

20:39.710 --> 20:41.120
Hey.

20:41.120 --> 20:42.380
I need a second,
Asher.

20:42.380 --> 20:43.830
I know how we get them
to leave.

20:45.330 --> 20:48.420
Gabriel killed
Vivian's boyfriend.

20:48.420 --> 20:52.290
What?
Yeah, he told Michaela,
or at least...he hinted at it.

20:52.290 --> 20:53.670
That's game over, right?

20:56.830 --> 20:59.040
We can't use that.
We just have to threaten
to use that.

20:59.040 --> 21:02.830
We can't keep hurting people and
not expect them to hurt us back.

21:02.830 --> 21:06.040
AK.

21:06.040 --> 21:10.670
What happened to Laurel and
Christopher wasn't your fault.

21:13.170 --> 21:16.790
Go help Connor.
He needs it.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.080
Hey.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.460
Hate to say
I told you so.

21:25.460 --> 21:27.290
What does that mean?

21:27.290 --> 21:29.500
Your new boss is hanging out
with Vivian Maddox.

21:44.120 --> 21:45.670
I don't work with your son,
Ms. Maddox.

21:45.670 --> 21:48.880
Middleton University
oversees our clinic.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.080
Professor Keating's
involvement in the clinic

21:51.080 --> 21:53.880
is why I'm coming to you,
as a concerned parent.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.460
What's the concern?

21:55.460 --> 21:57.460
I've heard some rumors.

21:57.460 --> 22:00.290
People love to gossip,
especially about Annalise.

22:00.290 --> 22:02.670
Rumors about her being involved
in illegal activity.

22:06.330 --> 22:09.080
I'm still not getting
what this has to do

22:09.080 --> 22:10.960
with your son
or my firm.

22:10.960 --> 22:14.120
If Annalise Keating were
arrested for illegal activity

22:14.120 --> 22:16.330
while working for you,
there'd be lawsuits,

22:16.330 --> 22:19.330
many of which your firm
would pick up the tab for.

22:19.330 --> 22:21.500
I mean, if my son
got implicated in her crimes,

22:21.500 --> 22:23.080
I know I'd sue you.

22:25.500 --> 22:26.500
It's Telesco.

22:26.500 --> 22:29.330
She's pissed I got her fired
from the FBI,

22:29.330 --> 22:32.290
so she sent in Vivian.

22:32.290 --> 22:34.580
Girl must be scraping
the bottom of the barrel

22:34.580 --> 22:36.210
if she's using the ex-wife
to take you down.

22:38.040 --> 22:39.670
What's wrong?

22:39.670 --> 22:41.880
Tell me.

22:41.880 --> 22:43.080
Are you playing me?

22:47.000 --> 22:49.790
I'm trying
to be your friend here,

22:49.790 --> 22:51.620
but you're making it
really hard.

22:51.620 --> 22:54.080
I'm not the one
hiding things.
Really?

22:54.080 --> 22:56.330
Because I covered
for your ass

22:56.330 --> 22:58.540
when you went to the "spa"
in California.

22:58.540 --> 23:01.710
Meanwhile, I was here being
interrogated by the FBI.

23:01.710 --> 23:04.120
They think I killed Emmett, and
now you're accusing me of this?

23:04.120 --> 23:05.960
No. Unh-unh. Nope.

23:05.960 --> 23:08.330
Why didn't you tell me that
you were meeting with Vivian?

23:08.330 --> 23:09.920
Because the last time
I gave you bad news,

23:09.920 --> 23:11.040
you ended up in rehab.

23:17.620 --> 23:20.620
I'm one of the only friends
you've got here.

23:20.620 --> 23:23.330
You need me more
than I need you.

23:23.330 --> 23:25.540
But if you
can't trust me --

23:25.540 --> 23:26.330
I can.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.920
And I do.

23:29.920 --> 23:32.000
Thank you.

23:38.380 --> 23:39.790
Hey, where are you?

23:39.790 --> 23:42.000
Virginia.
What?

23:42.000 --> 23:44.790
My father's in prison here.
Maybe.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.580
I'm waiting for the clerk
to tell me.

23:46.580 --> 23:49.120
So distract me?

23:49.120 --> 23:50.500
How did it go
with your mom?

23:50.500 --> 23:53.290
Not good.

23:53.290 --> 23:55.620
To the point Annalise
told me I should go home.

24:00.540 --> 24:01.920
Y-You agree?

24:01.920 --> 24:06.710
I-I think that's a decision
only you can make.

24:06.710 --> 24:10.210
Right.

24:10.210 --> 24:12.540
I-Is this you
pushing me away?

24:12.540 --> 24:14.920
Because I've been thinking
what we have is real.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.880
If that's not
how you feel --
Miss Pratt?

24:16.880 --> 24:20.250
Uh -- I'll ca--
I'll call you later.

24:24.460 --> 24:26.080
Good news.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.880
Our records show
that "D. Halpern"

24:27.880 --> 24:29.290
is your Dwight Halpern.

24:29.290 --> 24:33.080
He's here?
Was.

24:33.080 --> 24:35.620
He got transferred
to Mohawk Correctional Facility

24:35.620 --> 24:37.250
two years ago.

24:37.250 --> 24:39.420
Uh...
Uh, where's that?

24:39.420 --> 24:40.620
Upstate New York.

25:17.920 --> 25:20.120
Crothers: This is a small
amount of cocaine.

25:20.120 --> 25:23.960
Why even prosecute
Ms...Maddox for this?

25:23.960 --> 25:25.960
I'm not sure we should,
but until I see

25:25.960 --> 25:28.170
what's under seal,
I can't make a recommendation

25:28.170 --> 25:29.790
one way or another
to my boss.

25:29.790 --> 25:31.500
Who is your boss
right now?

25:31.500 --> 25:33.330
Stevens.

25:33.330 --> 25:35.380
He wants us to put pressure
on low-level offenders.

25:35.380 --> 25:37.330
Hence, here I am.

25:40.830 --> 25:43.830
It's Vivian's federal file.
I got it unsealed.

25:43.830 --> 25:46.830
She's on probation
for drugs -- meth.

25:46.830 --> 25:49.080
We already knew that.
But we didn't know why.

25:49.080 --> 25:50.920
Here.

25:53.620 --> 25:57.290
She was arrested for drug
trafficking just last year.

25:59.330 --> 26:01.580
She's in no place
to be threatening anyone.

26:01.580 --> 26:04.000
How'd you get this?

26:04.000 --> 26:06.380
Doesn't matter.
Bonnie,
you can't keep doing this.

26:06.380 --> 26:08.790
It's fine.
Do you want to die?

26:10.210 --> 26:14.580
My counselor at rehab said that
I'd die if I kept this up --

26:14.580 --> 26:18.170
fixing other people's crap
instead of my own.

26:18.170 --> 26:19.960
Now you're doing it, too.

26:24.460 --> 26:26.790
Why'd you come back?

26:28.080 --> 26:30.500
Really?

26:32.920 --> 26:35.620
And don't you dare say
it was for us.

26:35.620 --> 26:38.290
Why not?

26:38.290 --> 26:40.460
You can't handle the fact
that I love you?

26:40.460 --> 26:43.880
I know you love me.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.830
I just want you
to love yourself, too.

26:46.830 --> 26:49.620
You're telling me that?

26:57.620 --> 27:01.290
They're coming for us,
Bonnie.

27:01.290 --> 27:03.880
It's not if, it's when.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.710
Uh, in Me-- in Mexico,
dÃ³nde estÃ¡?

27:11.710 --> 27:12.830
Uh, in Sinaloa?
Here?

27:12.830 --> 27:14.290
Are there --
Are there gangs here? Bad men?

27:14.290 --> 27:17.460
Hey. I come bearing gifts.

27:17.460 --> 27:19.670
Cheesesteak
is the universal language.

27:19.670 --> 27:21.500
What am I gonna do?

27:21.500 --> 27:23.080
I have nothing to offer
the judge tomorrow.

27:23.080 --> 27:24.830
Wait, that's not the only gift
I smuggled in.

27:26.830 --> 27:28.210
How'd you do that?

27:28.210 --> 27:30.580
Oh. I'm a rule-breaker.
Haven't you heard?

27:30.580 --> 27:33.330
And I downloaded an app
to translate --

27:33.330 --> 27:35.670
H-Hey, Hector!
That-- That's not for...

27:39.620 --> 27:41.080
Oh, my God.

27:41.080 --> 27:43.380
H-Hector? Mi bebÃ©.

27:43.380 --> 27:46.920
Mi bebÃ©. Â¿EstÃ¡s bien?
Â¿EstÃ¡s salvo?

27:52.750 --> 27:54.670
Her name's Marisol.

27:54.670 --> 27:56.170
She speaks English, not great,
b-better than my Spanish.

27:56.170 --> 27:56.920
But the --
the point is she's here.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.710
Where?
Maryland.

27:58.710 --> 27:59.920
She came last year
to work

27:59.920 --> 28:01.710
and then sent for Hector
when she had money.

28:01.710 --> 28:03.330
He was with other people
from their town,

28:03.330 --> 28:04.290
but they got separated
at the border.

28:04.290 --> 28:06.500
So we get Marisol
to testify for him, right?

28:06.500 --> 28:09.380
I mean, she can speak
to the gang violence back home.

28:09.380 --> 28:10.960
You can't ask her to do that.
Why?

28:10.960 --> 28:13.120
Because ICE uses kids
like Hector as bait

28:13.120 --> 28:14.960
to arrest undocumented
parents.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.120
They'll both get deported.

28:16.120 --> 28:18.380
Okay.
W-Well, what do we do?

28:18.380 --> 28:20.380
Well, you have to come up
with Plan B.

28:20.380 --> 28:21.540
Are you serious?
I need your help.

28:21.540 --> 28:23.750
Connor, you're graduating
in three months.

28:23.750 --> 28:25.540
I'm not gonna be around
after that

28:25.540 --> 28:27.210
to give you
all the answers.

28:27.210 --> 28:28.750
So you have
to get used to it now.

28:36.210 --> 28:38.580
Half a gram.
$50.

28:42.750 --> 28:44.120
Keep the rest.

28:44.120 --> 28:45.580
Gracias.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.710
Frank: Annalise?

28:56.500 --> 28:57.500
Annalise?

29:00.710 --> 29:02.210
Annalise?

29:02.210 --> 29:04.620
Where the hell
have you been?

29:04.620 --> 29:06.750
Uh, my dad got caught up
in some crap.

29:06.750 --> 29:08.170
So did I.

29:08.170 --> 29:10.880
Aunt Viv's here, and I need you
to help me deal with her.

29:13.290 --> 29:14.920
It's meth.

29:14.920 --> 29:16.500
You're gonna plant that
on Vivian,

29:16.500 --> 29:18.170
and I'll take care
of the rest.

29:22.290 --> 29:23.380
Frank.

29:27.040 --> 29:28.670
Frank!

29:33.250 --> 29:34.620
We don't know
what kind of trap

29:34.620 --> 29:35.920
the FBI's laying out
for us right now.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.540
We got to be smart.

29:37.540 --> 29:39.040
Where were you?
Really?

29:42.330 --> 29:44.960
It's for
a safe deposit box.

29:44.960 --> 29:46.750
I found it
in Laurel's room.

29:46.750 --> 29:50.120
Only one other person
has access -- a family member.

29:50.120 --> 29:51.330
Thought it
might be Jorge.

29:51.330 --> 29:53.750
It's not.
I know that now.

29:53.750 --> 29:54.880
It's Wes.

29:57.290 --> 30:00.670
I wrote it all down.
Everything I know.

30:00.670 --> 30:03.000
I have another copy
in a safe deposit box.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.620
One phone call,
and it gets sent to the police.

30:08.170 --> 30:09.920
What does it say?

30:09.920 --> 30:14.670
Everything, probably.
Sam, Rebecca. All of it.

30:17.540 --> 30:19.250
I'll find a way in.

30:21.290 --> 30:23.500
I'll figure it out.
I always do.

30:27.210 --> 30:30.540
Judge Bines:
You have a witness you'd like
to examine, Mr. Walsh?

30:30.540 --> 30:31.830
Yes, Your Honor.

30:31.830 --> 30:34.210
I'd like to call
Immigration and Customs Agent

30:34.210 --> 30:36.170
Zach Mills to the stand,
please.

30:37.420 --> 30:39.670
You're up.

30:39.670 --> 30:41.250
For the record,
I don't condone this plan.

30:41.250 --> 30:42.040
What plan?

30:44.040 --> 30:46.620
Aah! No! No! No!

30:46.620 --> 30:48.620
Tranquilo, Hector.
Nadie te va a hacer daÃ±o.

30:48.620 --> 30:51.040
No le dejes que me lleve!
Por favor!

30:51.040 --> 30:52.830
Mr. Walsh,
may I suggest a recess?

30:52.830 --> 30:54.420
That's not necessary,
Your Honor.

30:54.420 --> 30:56.830
This man is not
a real ICE agent.

30:56.830 --> 30:59.830
Hector's reaction, however,
is very much real.

30:59.830 --> 31:01.830
Or you coached him!
How?

31:01.830 --> 31:04.460
Hector can't even talk
due to the trauma

31:04.460 --> 31:06.460
that he's suffered inside
the detention center.

31:06.460 --> 31:07.960
Ms. Price,
were you part of this charade?

31:07.960 --> 31:11.540
No, Your Honor, this was my idea
to illustrate the horror

31:11.540 --> 31:13.540
of my client's inhumane
living conditions.

31:13.540 --> 31:15.750
His living conditions
are not at issue here.

31:15.750 --> 31:18.960
Article 37 of the U.N.
Convention on Rights of Children

31:18.960 --> 31:22.580
demands -- "No child shall
be subjected to torture."

31:22.580 --> 31:25.120
By that standard alone,
my client deserves asylum.

31:25.120 --> 31:28.330
Google "Korematsu Chief Justice
repugnant."

31:28.330 --> 31:30.750
...to secure our borders.
Roper v. Simmons.

31:30.750 --> 31:33.920
The Supreme Court said that
international standards matter

31:33.920 --> 31:35.290
in how we treat children.

31:35.290 --> 31:36.880
Eh, the Supreme Court
also made clear

31:36.880 --> 31:38.620
that that those standards
are not binding.
Here.

31:38.620 --> 31:41.040
Just last year,
the Chief Justice wrote

31:41.040 --> 31:42.620
that the internment
of Japanese-Americans

31:42.620 --> 31:45.540
in World War II
was "morally repugnant."

31:45.540 --> 31:46.710
Look at this boy.

31:46.710 --> 31:48.500
Can you honestly say
that the conditions

31:48.500 --> 31:51.330
we have him in
are not morally repugnant?

31:51.330 --> 31:55.380
Your Honor, the Chief Justice's
remarks were about Korematsu,

31:55.380 --> 31:57.380
a case that has never
been overruled.

31:57.380 --> 32:00.210
Let me quote
the Chief Justice.

32:00.210 --> 32:03.330
"Korematsu was gravely wrong
the day it was decided,

32:03.330 --> 32:05.460
has been overruled
in the court of history,

32:05.460 --> 32:08.080
and has no place in law
under the Constitution."

32:08.080 --> 32:10.460
We're talking about immigrant
processing centers.

32:10.460 --> 32:12.460
We're not talking
about wartime camps.

32:12.460 --> 32:15.500
We're talking about rounding up
innocent children

32:15.500 --> 32:18.670
on American soil and caging them
behind barbed wire.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.710
How is that any different than
what we did to the Japanese?

32:20.710 --> 32:22.460
Mr. Walsh,
I appreciate your point --

32:22.460 --> 32:25.290
At least six non-American
children have died

32:25.290 --> 32:27.080
in the custody of ICE --
Mr. Walsh, let me speak.

32:27.080 --> 32:29.710
And I refuse to wait
for my client to die...
Connor, stop.

32:29.710 --> 32:32.120
...due to the neglect
and cruelty that he is suffering

32:32.120 --> 32:33.880
at the hands
of the American Government!

32:33.880 --> 32:37.710
I agree with you,
Mr. Walsh!

32:37.710 --> 32:40.670
And while no one has ever
had the creativity to invoke

32:40.670 --> 32:44.290
these precedents, I cannot allow
them to decide this case.

32:44.290 --> 32:47.620
Your Honor --
What I can do is issue
a continuance

32:47.620 --> 32:49.830
based on your client's
mental state.

32:49.830 --> 32:51.830
Ms. Ford,
please coordinate

32:51.830 --> 32:54.040
with the Office
of Refugee Resettlement

32:54.040 --> 32:55.460
to place him
in foster care.

32:55.460 --> 32:57.620
Your Honor, there's no legal
standing for this.

32:57.620 --> 33:00.420
Unless you can argue
a legal justification

33:00.420 --> 33:03.540
for the torture of children,
you've lost.

33:03.540 --> 33:05.380
Mr. Walsh?

33:05.380 --> 33:06.670
Well done.

33:15.880 --> 33:18.120
Tell him that
I'll get his mom asylum.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.380
Okay. I know
you're feeling yourself --

33:20.380 --> 33:23.790
Look, Marisol can actually
testify to the gang violence,

33:23.790 --> 33:26.960
and if we get her asylum, it'll
be easier to get Hector asylum.

33:26.960 --> 33:28.500
Are you this presumptuous
when Annalise is around?

33:28.500 --> 33:31.330
You know it's a good idea.
Just tell him.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.620
Mira.

33:43.830 --> 33:46.460
SÃ­, Hector.

33:46.460 --> 33:48.040
Promise.

33:54.460 --> 33:57.460
Can Connor
actually do that?

33:57.460 --> 33:59.460
Highly unlikely.

34:04.170 --> 34:05.540
Wait, wait, wait!
Michaela Pratt.

34:05.540 --> 34:07.960
I just drove seven hours to see
my client, Dwight Halpern.

34:07.960 --> 34:11.540
We close at 5:00. It's 5:03.
I don't get paid overtime.

34:11.540 --> 34:14.540
Dwight Halpern's not my client!
He's my father!

34:14.540 --> 34:18.290
I-I never met him,
and up until a few days ago,

34:18.290 --> 34:20.710
I didn't want to.

34:20.710 --> 34:22.080
He's...

34:22.080 --> 34:23.500
âª I can't see the stars âª

34:23.500 --> 34:27.170
He's nothing to me.
A stranger.

34:27.170 --> 34:30.920
I didn't care if he was lost
in the stupid system.

34:30.920 --> 34:33.330
But then I found him.

34:33.330 --> 34:34.750
You can't lose
a human being.

34:34.750 --> 34:36.960
T-T-That's not a thing.

34:36.960 --> 34:39.170
He's a man, not a file,
even if America

34:39.170 --> 34:40.540
doesn't want us to know
the difference.

34:40.540 --> 34:43.920
Because I found him.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.170
He's here.

34:45.170 --> 34:47.580
âª How do you bury the shadows? âª

34:47.580 --> 34:50.750
My father is here,
and I really don't want to wait

34:50.750 --> 34:52.880
another night to meet him.

34:52.880 --> 34:55.420
Please.

34:55.420 --> 34:57.960
You owe me a six pack.
âª How do you bury the shadows? âª

35:01.790 --> 35:06.500
We gotta talk.
Let me guess -- now Tegan's KGB?

35:06.500 --> 35:08.500
Tegan's not who I'm worried
about right now.

35:08.500 --> 35:11.460
âª How do you bury the shadows? âª

35:11.460 --> 35:13.250
Vivian's talking
to the FBI.

35:13.250 --> 35:17.040
âª How do you bury the shadows? âª

35:20.330 --> 35:23.120
Your son killed
your boyfriend.

35:30.170 --> 35:32.790
So it's true. You're as
desperate as Hannah said?

35:32.790 --> 35:34.250
You and Hannah still talk?
Give that bitch my regards.

35:34.250 --> 35:35.210
Let's call her right now.
Let's.

35:35.210 --> 35:36.830
Let's tell her the truth
about your boy.

35:36.830 --> 35:38.040
You lie for a living,
Annalise,

35:38.040 --> 35:39.000
just like you're lying
about this.

35:39.000 --> 35:40.420
No, I'm being nice
by not going

35:40.420 --> 35:42.620
to the FBI
with this information.

35:42.620 --> 35:44.790
So not even the police, huh?
You go straight to the FBI?

35:44.790 --> 35:46.580
I'm following your lead.

35:46.580 --> 35:48.620
You wearing
a wire right now?

35:50.500 --> 35:53.500
Because that would be
real bad...

35:53.500 --> 35:55.710
them hearing how your son
slipped your boyfriend

35:55.710 --> 35:57.080
the pills
that killed him.

35:57.080 --> 35:59.080
That didn't happen.
Because it was you?

35:59.080 --> 36:00.880
Paul overdosed.
Gabriel wanted him to.

36:00.880 --> 36:02.750
And God only knows
what the FBI

36:02.750 --> 36:04.790
will do to him
once they find out.

36:04.790 --> 36:08.540
They might even decide
he's the bad guy and not me.

36:13.790 --> 36:15.210
What's this about?

36:15.210 --> 36:17.330
Do you have more information
on Ron's case?

36:17.330 --> 36:19.210
Some.

36:19.210 --> 36:22.000
Due to the Governor's
accusations against him

36:22.000 --> 36:24.790
and the suspicions surrounding
his death, my team has been

36:24.790 --> 36:26.710
investigating this office
for corruption.

36:26.710 --> 36:28.500
I assumed.

36:28.500 --> 36:31.380
Really? Then why fabricate
the case file on Vivian Maddox?

36:36.710 --> 36:39.710
I'm sorry.

36:41.250 --> 36:43.620
I was trying to
find something

36:43.620 --> 36:46.000
that might prove Ron
was innocent.

36:48.250 --> 36:51.420
And I knew that he was talking
to her son, Gabriel,

36:51.420 --> 36:52.830
and so I-I thought
that maybe

36:52.830 --> 36:54.620
putting pressure
on his mother...

36:55.880 --> 36:57.540
...would turn up something new.

36:57.540 --> 37:00.750
It was a terrible lapse
in judgement.

37:00.750 --> 37:02.040
An illegal one.

37:02.040 --> 37:04.540
Alright. Whatever
you need me to do --

37:04.540 --> 37:06.080
There's nothing.

37:06.080 --> 37:08.040
Your position at
the District Attorney's office

37:08.040 --> 37:09.170
is terminated.

37:09.170 --> 37:13.040
Effective immediately.

37:13.040 --> 37:14.250
Vivian: What do you want
from me, Annalise?

37:14.250 --> 37:15.830
Simple. Take your son
and go away.

37:15.830 --> 37:17.420
That's all I want, too.

37:17.420 --> 37:18.580
Then apologize to him,
because that's what he wants.

37:18.580 --> 37:20.000
You're gonna tell me
what he wants?

37:20.000 --> 37:22.000
I'm telling you
to go home

37:22.000 --> 37:24.210
instead of whatever this is,
because I don't get it,

37:24.210 --> 37:25.420
you coming here
to destroy me.

37:25.420 --> 37:27.750
Why? Because I stole
your husband 25 years ago?

37:27.750 --> 37:28.790
Get over it.

37:30.500 --> 37:34.920
You know, I would like
nothing else but to come here

37:34.920 --> 37:39.290
and tell you how great
my life's been since Sam,

37:39.290 --> 37:41.250
how I was betrayed,
but I stayed strong

37:41.250 --> 37:43.460
'cause I'm magic,
how all I had to do

37:43.460 --> 37:45.670
was look into my baby boy's eyes
and know I got

37:45.670 --> 37:47.210
the better end
of the deal.

37:47.210 --> 37:50.540
But things didn't go
that way for me, Annalise.

37:54.380 --> 37:57.790
Sam was the magic.

37:57.790 --> 37:59.210
You felt it, too.

37:59.210 --> 38:03.290
A man who not only sees you,
sees the ugliness inside of you,

38:03.290 --> 38:07.670
but wants you even more
because of it.

38:09.460 --> 38:13.040
Sam wanted me
like I was perfect.

38:13.040 --> 38:15.580
All of me, just perfect.

38:15.580 --> 38:21.170
You don't get to feel that
and be okay when it goes away.

38:21.170 --> 38:24.330
It's a horrible feeling,
a death.

38:24.330 --> 38:25.960
And I blame Sam.
Of course I do.

38:25.960 --> 38:27.830
He's the one
who broke vows.

38:27.830 --> 38:29.420
âª The secrets and the lies âª

38:29.420 --> 38:32.080
But I blame you, too.

38:32.080 --> 38:33.290
âª This night is our disguise âª

38:33.290 --> 38:35.380
I'm sorry.
Oh, shut the hell up.

38:38.790 --> 38:40.790
I saw you coming out
of his office.

38:40.790 --> 38:43.000
âª Dark shadows in the sky âª

38:43.000 --> 38:45.000
And I saw the way
he was looking at you,

38:45.000 --> 38:47.960
smiling, and then I knew
it was you.

38:47.960 --> 38:49.210
The wife.

38:49.210 --> 38:50.580
âª This night is our disguise âª

38:50.580 --> 38:52.330
And he gave me
that same look

38:52.330 --> 38:55.170
in one of our sessions,
that same smile.

38:55.170 --> 38:58.210
And I knew he wanted me.

38:58.210 --> 39:00.540
âª Consume me from inside âª

39:00.540 --> 39:03.620
So I let him kiss me.

39:03.620 --> 39:05.420
That's the truth,
Vivian.

39:05.420 --> 39:09.170
He came after me,
his patient.

39:09.170 --> 39:11.580
And God knows
I could have said no,

39:11.580 --> 39:16.580
but I needed him to see me
to make myself feel worthy.

39:16.580 --> 39:19.620
And now look at us --
two dark-skinned sisters

39:19.620 --> 39:22.380
playing out the same story,
giving everything over

39:22.380 --> 39:25.790
to a man who sees us
in a world that doesn't.

39:25.790 --> 39:29.210
It's not magic, Vivian.
It's a lie.

39:29.210 --> 39:34.830
âª How we will live or die âª

39:34.830 --> 39:37.830
Hey.
âª Hold your breath âª

39:39.290 --> 39:43.000
We found him.
âª We're not turning back âª

39:45.250 --> 39:47.670
Hey. I'd like to access
a safe deposit box.

39:47.670 --> 39:49.330
Your name?

39:49.330 --> 39:50.420
Wes Gibbins.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.620
âª Hold your breath âª

40:06.620 --> 40:09.040
Hey, uh...you have a way
to tell me

40:09.040 --> 40:10.170
who the last person
to access this was?

40:12.830 --> 40:15.580
Laurel Castillo.

40:15.580 --> 40:17.000
When?

40:17.000 --> 40:18.250
Three days ago.

40:22.620 --> 40:26.420
âª Hold your breath âª

40:26.420 --> 40:29.460
âª Hold your breath âª

40:29.460 --> 40:30.710
So you're a killer now?
âª Hold your breath âª

40:30.710 --> 40:34.000
What?
Paul.

40:34.000 --> 40:37.040
âª Hold your breath âª

40:37.040 --> 40:40.670
âª Hold your breath âª

40:40.670 --> 40:43.380
âª We're not turning back âª
What's wrong?

40:47.500 --> 40:49.880
Did you know?

40:49.880 --> 40:51.120
Know what?

40:54.500 --> 40:58.080
My father's dead.

40:58.080 --> 41:00.290
He died in prison
last year.

41:00.290 --> 41:03.000
A stroke.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.120
I could have met him
if you'd told me.

41:06.120 --> 41:11.380
But he's dead
and it's too late.

41:11.380 --> 41:15.120
I was too
late, and it's your fault.

41:15.120 --> 41:16.380
So I hate you.

41:16.380 --> 41:18.960
Oh, I hate you.
I hate you so much.

41:18.960 --> 41:20.580
I hate you!

41:20.580 --> 41:23.210
I hate you!

41:25.620 --> 41:28.420
I hate you.

41:28.420 --> 41:31.210
I hate...

41:31.210 --> 41:32.790
I...

41:43.120 --> 41:45.670
What is wrong
with you people?

41:45.670 --> 41:47.330
I'm about to be a lawyer,
a great one.

41:47.330 --> 41:48.420
I know my freaking rights.
Ms. Pratt --

41:48.420 --> 41:51.040
I'll sue, starting
with the arresting officer

41:51.040 --> 41:53.460
whose Miranda warning
is defective ab initio.

41:53.460 --> 41:57.040
We have a dead informant
on our hands, Michaela.

41:57.040 --> 41:59.670
Your fingerprints match those
on the murder weapon.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.540
No more running.

42:10.540 --> 42:11.790
It's all over.

42:16.790 --> 42:18.420
I want my lawyer.
