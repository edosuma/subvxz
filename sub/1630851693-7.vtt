00:06.256 --> 00:09.634
Previously on 90 Day Fiance:
The Other Way...

00:23.314 --> 00:25.734
What should we do?
Because I feel like

00:25.817 --> 00:28.570
your mother is really
starting to lose it.

00:33.825 --> 00:38.079
Evelin found out that I was seeing
another girl while I was in Peru.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.131
I lied to Evelin.

00:48.214 --> 00:49.591
What should I do?

01:13.865 --> 01:16.743
You know, like, you know
Avi needs surgery.

01:16.826 --> 01:18.995
I have insurance in the US.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.415
Like, I have my ticket to go.

01:33.134 --> 01:35.887
Of course I will come back.

01:46.815 --> 01:48.650
Yeah, I did.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.867
I haven't been...

01:57.951 --> 02:01.329
100% open and candid with you.

02:01.413 --> 02:04.290
I am not a virgin.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.941
(SIGHING)

02:39.200 --> 02:42.954
I was very nervous to tell you
and I'm sorry that...

02:43.038 --> 02:44.497
I'm not...

02:44.581 --> 02:45.915
perfect.

02:47.125 --> 02:51.087
And, er...I'm not as chaste
as you are.

02:58.261 --> 03:00.263
Did you just drink...

03:01.389 --> 03:02.849
..that wine?

03:29.334 --> 03:33.922
Just because I have had troubles
living by all the standards...

03:34.005 --> 03:36.341
of the church doesn't mean that...

03:37.467 --> 03:39.260
..I'm not trying to improve.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.890
That's why I was so worried about
us living...

03:43.973 --> 03:45.684
in the same apartment.

04:11.418 --> 04:15.422
That's why I agreed to delete
my social media.

04:15.505 --> 04:20.301
I really am ready to move on
and leave my bachelor life behind.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.646
I probably made out with...

04:31.730 --> 04:34.607
um...over a hundred.

04:34.691 --> 04:37.485
And...of those...

04:40.488 --> 04:42.323
..maybe, like, two dozen...

04:42.407 --> 04:45.326
where they were kind of
more intimate.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.495
And maybe about...

04:49.414 --> 04:52.375
..five...four or five
where it was...

04:52.459 --> 04:55.337
we slept and...

04:55.420 --> 04:57.380
had sex.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.049
(SIGHING)

05:11.519 --> 05:13.563
The last time was about...

05:14.814 --> 05:16.274
..last October.

05:29.829 --> 05:31.247
It was...

05:31.331 --> 05:35.835
towards the beginning,
when we had just started talking

05:35.919 --> 05:37.837
and I had been explaining to you

05:37.921 --> 05:41.966
that I didn't feel ready to commit
to a serious relationship yet.

05:43.968 --> 05:45.303
Basically...

05:47.347 --> 05:51.559
..I went out on a date
and we ended up...

05:51.643 --> 05:53.395
having sex.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.314
Watching Star Wars.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.694
I just want to go outside.

06:29.597 --> 06:32.100
That's something she needed to know.

06:33.935 --> 06:35.895
But I feel bad that...

06:38.481 --> 06:42.235
..I did it in the first place
because it would have been better

06:42.318 --> 06:45.655
if I'd never did it and would never
have to have told her.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.078
I hate to see Alina in pain.

06:52.162 --> 06:54.080
And it was my fault.

07:21.149 --> 07:22.609
Alina...

07:23.985 --> 07:26.029
Alina, wait. Can we...

07:27.197 --> 07:28.656
Can we talk?

08:32.178 --> 08:33.388
Bye, baby.

08:39.853 --> 08:42.814
I told Evelin
that I'm gonna go look for jobs,

08:42.897 --> 08:45.358
which I do plan on doing.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.193
But I just have...

08:48.445 --> 08:51.865
..something that is more important
that needs to be done.

08:55.493 --> 08:59.122
I never properly said goodbye
to Jenny.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.915
I never properly...

09:00.999 --> 09:02.459
called it off.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.045
And I think that's important.

09:05.128 --> 09:07.630
Jenny actually lives
here in Ecuador,

09:07.714 --> 09:09.883
about an hour away from Engabao.

09:09.966 --> 09:14.179
The last time I saw Jenny was seven
months ago when I was in Peru.

09:14.262 --> 09:17.807
I was planning on going back
to Ecuador.

09:20.018 --> 09:23.188
I still need to figure out
what me and Evelin are doing,

09:23.271 --> 09:26.941
if we were actually going through
with the divorce, and Jenny said,

09:27.025 --> 09:31.071
"Look, I get it, figure out your
things, you know where I am."

09:31.154 --> 09:33.907
And I stopped talking with Jenny.

09:33.990 --> 09:37.535
I'm meeting up to apologise
for basically ghosting her,

09:37.619 --> 09:40.497
so we can both get some closure
on our relationship.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.541
Yeah, very good?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.626
Oh...

10:36.136 --> 10:37.846
Er...

10:37.929 --> 10:42.267
I never had a chance
to say I'm sorry.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.060
Um...

10:44.144 --> 10:46.604
I want you to know...

10:49.858 --> 10:51.192
Yes.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.237
Yes.

11:02.620 --> 11:04.456
I want you to know that.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.551
I did tell you that I was married,

11:58.635 --> 12:01.680
but at the time,
Evelin broke up with me.

12:01.763 --> 12:07.394
Me and Evelin were not in a
relationship when we were together.

12:50.854 --> 12:53.815
I feel bad for not talking with you.

12:53.898 --> 12:56.943
After...I left,

12:57.027 --> 12:59.779
you know, quarantine happened.

12:59.863 --> 13:03.366
Me and Evelin began
working through things.

13:05.660 --> 13:10.415
I just wanted to make sure
that you were not waiting for me

13:10.498 --> 13:15.086
and that you understood that me and
Evelin have worked through things.

14:04.511 --> 14:06.179
I'm going to tell Evelin

14:06.262 --> 14:09.683
everything about our relationship
we had together.

14:09.766 --> 14:11.685
Because it's the right thing to do.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.985
Hearing Jenny say
I need to be sincere with Evelin,

14:21.069 --> 14:24.531
she's right, I do need to be sincere
and honest with Evelin

14:24.614 --> 14:26.491
and tell her everything.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.786
But I'm just really afraid of
how she's going to take it.

14:52.517 --> 14:54.644
That's a big one, man.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.521
Oh, that's a big question.

14:56.604 --> 14:59.065
Can I take a sip?
I'll take a little sip.

15:00.275 --> 15:01.985
Is there any tequila back there?

15:06.740 --> 15:08.033
Goodbye.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.200
Ciao.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.453
I have feelings for Jenny
as a person.

15:11.536 --> 15:14.539
I really do care about
the time we spent together,

15:14.622 --> 15:20.378
but my heart and my love
and my future is with Evelin.

15:21.588 --> 15:26.509
I just hope Evelin truly understands
when I tell her the full truth.

15:44.986 --> 15:48.656
Well, I mean,
I just hope this goes well.

15:48.740 --> 15:51.826
I hope the counsellor's able
to calm them down,

15:51.910 --> 15:53.244
make them listen.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.248
Yeah.

15:58.917 --> 16:03.254
After hitting yet another roadblock
with Sumit's family the other day,

16:03.338 --> 16:07.050
we decided to meet with
a family counsellor.

16:08.176 --> 16:11.930
So we're gonna have a session,
all four of us together.

16:12.013 --> 16:16.309
At this point, we need
an outsider to tell us

16:16.393 --> 16:19.562
what would be the best thing
for us to do.

16:25.235 --> 16:27.362
Yeah, that would be great.

16:28.530 --> 16:31.491
I'm nervous to face
Sumit's parents again.

16:31.574 --> 16:35.161
The last time was
when they came to my house

16:35.245 --> 16:38.957
and just verbally abused me
and disrespected me.

16:40.291 --> 16:42.752
I don't think I would have agreed
to meet them

16:42.836 --> 16:44.921
outside of the counselling session.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.132
This has to work with your parents

16:47.215 --> 16:49.676
because if it doesn't,
then what else?

16:51.011 --> 16:52.804
What else do we have left?

16:52.887 --> 16:54.806
I feel like this is our last option.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.031
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

18:14.761 --> 18:17.389
I'm feeling very nervous, actually.

18:17.472 --> 18:19.057
Very nervous.

18:21.643 --> 18:24.354
Just because of the last meeting
that we had.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.898
I'm so just very hurt by that.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.902
I just don't know what to expect
right now.

20:11.169 --> 20:12.712
I understood that part.

20:14.214 --> 20:18.176
That we're going good together now,
but after 10 or 15 years...

20:19.678 --> 20:21.846
..I'll be in a wheelchair
or rocking chair.

20:36.486 --> 20:38.905
After you, there is nobody else.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.783
I won't care,
I won't need anybody else.

21:10.854 --> 21:12.355
That's not old.

21:14.482 --> 21:17.736
That's not old.
You're still gonna be a young guy.

21:55.523 --> 21:57.567
We came here for some family...

21:57.650 --> 22:01.404
for some counselling, and I don't
feel like it's doing any good.

22:01.488 --> 22:04.449
We're at the same place.

22:04.532 --> 22:06.409
You're not gonna ever choose me,

22:06.493 --> 22:09.204
you'll always go with
what your parents want.

22:11.206 --> 22:13.333
And you'll never move past it.

24:35.392 --> 24:36.726
Ah...

25:00.125 --> 25:02.585
Are you getting
all the paperwork together?

25:02.669 --> 25:06.089
I am just making sure
we have everything we need.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.842
My daughter Cassie went home
a few days ago

25:08.925 --> 25:10.844
and I miss her so much already.

25:10.927 --> 25:13.430
It was such a blessing
to have her here.

25:13.513 --> 25:17.642
She brought a piece of home
to Mexico for me.

25:17.726 --> 25:19.811
It was much needed for me.

25:21.312 --> 25:22.647
I think that's all.

25:22.731 --> 25:26.401
All right, we'd better get going,
we're running a little late. Yeah.

25:30.613 --> 25:33.783
We still don't know if my father
will come to the wedding,

25:33.867 --> 25:37.746
but we'll focus on the positive and
keep moving on with the planning.

25:39.998 --> 25:42.083
We just picked a date
for the wedding

25:42.167 --> 25:44.711
so we need to go back
to the marriage office.

25:44.794 --> 25:46.296
Big, big day.

25:46.379 --> 25:47.672
I hope.

25:47.756 --> 25:49.299
It IS a big day.

25:50.759 --> 25:53.178
We can't get bigger than this,
right?

26:00.435 --> 26:02.520
She says she hopes they approve us.

26:02.604 --> 26:03.938
Aww! Completely.

26:06.274 --> 26:07.776
Completely.

26:09.694 --> 26:13.948
I'll be honest, I'm very, very
excited, I hope it goes very well.

26:14.032 --> 26:15.492
But I...

26:17.077 --> 26:19.079
..admit that I am a little worried

26:19.162 --> 26:21.790
just cos I know how things go
here in Mexico.

26:21.873 --> 26:25.460
The last time was not so pleasant,
obviously.

26:27.253 --> 26:29.798
Over a year ago,
when Kenny and I first applied

26:29.881 --> 26:33.176
for our marriage licence,
we were automatically denied.

26:33.259 --> 26:36.429
What does it say the denial is for?

26:36.513 --> 26:39.557
Um, to...save...

26:40.725 --> 26:42.435
..like, the human species.

26:45.772 --> 26:49.943
And this only through the union
of man and a woman.

26:50.026 --> 26:52.153
They said we have to go
to Human Rights,

26:52.237 --> 26:54.656
get them involved,
then come back to us.

26:54.739 --> 26:57.200
It was just a lot of confusion

26:57.283 --> 27:00.453
and obviously heartache,
you know, it was hard.

27:00.537 --> 27:03.373
I'm hoping this is the last of it

27:03.456 --> 27:05.542
and we will get the official...

27:05.625 --> 27:10.714
from their mouths, sitting
in front of us, saying you're good.

27:10.797 --> 27:12.257
There's always that fear

27:12.340 --> 27:15.510
that even though we have
the Human Rights Office letter,

27:15.593 --> 27:18.680
that they will still say
this isn't good enough,

27:18.763 --> 27:20.348
stamp "denial" on it and say,

27:20.432 --> 27:24.310
you need to go over here and try
this now. There's always that fear.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.527
All right, there we are.

27:35.864 --> 27:37.741
We're ready.

27:37.824 --> 27:40.952
Put on my...face mask.

27:44.748 --> 27:46.124
Are you nervous?

27:46.207 --> 27:48.501
Excited and nervous. Yes.

28:43.306 --> 28:46.101
..we don't even need this letter
any more,

28:46.184 --> 28:49.104
that they're authorised to approve
any marriage now.

28:49.187 --> 28:52.232
Excellent. That's a big win.

29:08.248 --> 29:09.374
OK.

29:19.300 --> 29:22.595
So not just this office, but the
whole state is now allowing it.

29:22.679 --> 29:24.931
Any office we would go to
will allow it.

29:25.015 --> 29:26.307
Wow.

29:26.391 --> 29:28.309
I was not expecting this. Wow.

29:28.393 --> 29:30.437
That's amazing. Amazing.

29:34.232 --> 29:37.527
He can tell us now that we are
on the other side of it all.

29:37.610 --> 29:39.654
That's amazing. Yes. Right?

29:47.954 --> 29:52.083
Growing up here in Mexico and
being from a conservative country,

29:52.167 --> 29:54.794
and never thinking
that I could get married,

29:54.878 --> 29:58.131
and now being approved,
it's an amazing feeling.

29:58.214 --> 30:01.760
It's wonderful to know that others
will have it easier than we did.

30:01.843 --> 30:03.970
It makes the fight worth it, really.

30:15.023 --> 30:17.025
It's great. Great news, huh?

30:17.108 --> 30:18.568
Yeah.

30:36.336 --> 30:38.880
Thank you. Thank you so much.

30:38.963 --> 30:42.175
We can finally be married.
Best day ever!

30:45.387 --> 30:47.430
Love you.

31:10.120 --> 31:11.621
Good morning.

31:15.291 --> 31:16.418
Um...

31:17.919 --> 31:20.588
..good luck picking your mom up.

31:24.467 --> 31:29.055
Yesterday, I confessed to Alina
that I'm not a virgin

31:29.139 --> 31:34.144
and that I had slept with someone
after we'd met.

31:37.022 --> 31:39.399
And she's super-pissed at me.

31:42.444 --> 31:45.113
Yeah, I'm trying to, kind of,

31:45.196 --> 31:48.783
make things look nice for her
when her mom gets here.

31:52.537 --> 31:55.707
We've barely spoken since then,
and to make matters worse,

31:55.790 --> 31:58.043
Alina's on her way to the airport
right now

31:58.126 --> 32:00.545
to pick up her mom
who's planning to visit us.

32:02.714 --> 32:05.050
Perhaps I didn't choose the most...

32:05.133 --> 32:10.263
timely circumstances to tell Alina

32:10.347 --> 32:14.434
about...my past and about,

32:14.517 --> 32:17.979
er, me sleeping with other girls.

32:19.356 --> 32:22.233
I've only met Alina's mom
once before in Prague.

32:22.317 --> 32:25.987
I know she was hesitant about Alina
coming to Turkey to be with me.

32:26.071 --> 32:30.241
So I'm really nervous that if Alina
tells her what went down between us,

32:30.325 --> 32:33.912
she'll try to convince Alina
to go back home to Russia with her.

32:33.995 --> 32:35.830
If Alina and I are to work out,

32:35.914 --> 32:38.416
I have to have the approval
of her family.

33:26.047 --> 33:27.757
Thank you.

36:49.042 --> 36:50.877
Let's take puppy for a walk.

36:52.087 --> 36:53.380
Yesterday, I saw Jenny

36:53.463 --> 36:56.675
and I definitively told her
our relationship was over.

37:00.261 --> 37:02.389
So now I need to come clean
to Evelin

37:02.472 --> 37:05.642
about the full extent
of my relationship with Jenny.

37:08.478 --> 37:09.688
Whoo-hoo!

37:09.771 --> 37:12.857
I'm really scared to come clean
to Evelin about everything

37:12.941 --> 37:16.820
because I have seen the way she's
reacted in the past when I tell her

37:16.903 --> 37:20.156
things that I haven't been
fully honest with her about.

37:20.240 --> 37:24.035
But I don't want to hold anything
back from Evelin

37:24.119 --> 37:28.415
because I know
it's the right thing to do.

37:28.498 --> 37:29.916
They're so good.

37:35.672 --> 37:39.884
I'm having a lot of second thoughts,
wishing I had already told Evelin

37:39.968 --> 37:42.971
the full truth a while ago,
like when it happened.

37:43.054 --> 37:46.808
Because I held all this information
from her for so long,

37:46.891 --> 37:49.436
it's just gonna make things
that much worse.

37:52.188 --> 37:53.606
Ah.

38:05.326 --> 38:06.703
Um...

38:08.246 --> 38:10.290
..so...

38:12.167 --> 38:14.669
..you know I love you, beautiful,
all right?

38:15.920 --> 38:18.340
I want to be 100% honest with you.

38:19.758 --> 38:23.470
Planning the wedding and everything
and I just wanted to...

38:23.553 --> 38:26.514
basically come clean to you
about everything that...

38:26.598 --> 38:29.684
happened when we separated,
you know?

38:36.983 --> 38:41.112
So, here's the thing. Yes,
there was rumours that, you know...

38:42.447 --> 38:45.867
..you know, that I had a girlfriend,
OK? And...

38:47.494 --> 38:52.832
Um...it wasn't actually just like
a one-night...thing.

38:54.167 --> 38:56.878
Jenny, it was more serious than...

38:56.961 --> 38:59.589
what I led on to believe.

39:04.928 --> 39:07.681
Yeah, we were actually...

39:07.764 --> 39:09.265
in a relationship.

39:10.517 --> 39:13.186
You know, she was...my girlfriend.

40:11.119 --> 40:15.123
I did still have feelings for you.
I didn't just forget about you.

40:15.206 --> 40:18.501
I was in a really tough place,
you know? I really was.

40:19.711 --> 40:22.213
I'm not. I'm just coming clean
to you about it.

40:45.111 --> 40:46.696
No. I was dating somebody

40:46.780 --> 40:50.116
when you decided to break up
with me, and that was it.

41:01.002 --> 41:04.255
You literally told me...it's OK...

41:05.715 --> 41:08.134
..for us to see other people.
You said that.

41:09.386 --> 41:11.012
You wanted me...

41:11.096 --> 41:13.264
to leave the country.

41:31.574 --> 41:33.284
I cut ties.

41:33.368 --> 41:35.495
I just said...

41:35.578 --> 41:38.456
"Look, I'm in love with Evelin,

41:38.540 --> 41:41.584
"and, you know, what we had
is what we had,

41:41.668 --> 41:44.254
"I'm getting married and that's it."

41:44.337 --> 41:46.631
Like, you know, that's it.

42:02.856 --> 42:07.068
I know that I can treat you right,
I do know this.

42:07.152 --> 42:10.822
I can, and this is me
coming forwards right now,

42:10.905 --> 42:12.949
putting everything on the table,

42:13.033 --> 42:16.786
and I really hope that you can find
it in your heart to forgive me.

42:16.870 --> 42:19.164
I'm so sorry. I am.

42:38.099 --> 42:39.434
Seriously?

43:58.638 --> 44:00.056
Ah.

44:19.075 --> 44:23.079
When I hear that Sumit's parents
want to move in with us,

44:23.163 --> 44:27.083
my first thought is no,
and not just no, but hell no.

47:10.747 --> 47:12.457
Living together in one house?

47:14.250 --> 47:15.460
We'll see.

47:15.543 --> 47:17.170
We'll see about that.

47:21.007 --> 47:24.010
The way Sumit's talking right now,
it sounds like

47:24.094 --> 47:27.764
we're actually really gonna do this,
and to me, that's crazy.

47:29.974 --> 47:34.437
I don't want to start a fight, so
I'm keeping it calm for now, but...

47:34.521 --> 47:37.065
we're definitely gonna
have to talk about this.

47:37.148 --> 47:40.860
You can't just invite the parents to
come and live with us at our home.

49:13.495 --> 49:16.373
I've only met Alina's mom once,

49:16.456 --> 49:19.584
and when we get married,
she's gonna be my mother-in-law,

49:19.668 --> 49:22.170
so I want to start things off
on the right foot.

49:22.253 --> 49:26.049
But if Alina tells her what
went down between us, I'm worried

49:26.132 --> 49:28.551
she's gonna come
right in the heat of things

49:28.635 --> 49:30.387
and just hate me from the start.

49:42.357 --> 49:47.904
I'm really nervous, but one trick up
my sleeve is, I can speak Russian,

49:47.987 --> 49:51.408
and Russian people usually like
my Russian because...

49:51.491 --> 49:55.245
I don't know, they just really like
when I speak Russian, so...

49:55.328 --> 49:57.997
I hope I can impress her with that.

49:58.081 --> 50:00.542
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

50:24.691 --> 50:26.192
Mmm!

50:29.529 --> 50:31.114
Mm-hm.

50:31.197 --> 50:32.949
Mmm!

50:51.301 --> 50:52.886
Juisty.

50:54.346 --> 50:56.681
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

50:59.434 --> 51:00.477
No.

51:29.297 --> 51:31.841
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

51:35.887 --> 51:36.930
OK.

56:15.083 --> 56:16.501
Hi, Bin.

56:16.584 --> 56:18.253
(SIGHING)

56:19.546 --> 56:21.214
You look so cute.

56:26.302 --> 56:29.222
I know, you don't want me to go,
but...

56:29.305 --> 56:32.475
I don't want to go.
I have to go.

56:33.768 --> 56:36.396
Tonight, I leave to go
back to the US

56:36.479 --> 56:39.315
so Avi can get the hernia
surgery he needs.

56:39.399 --> 56:41.860
And even though I'll only be gone
one month,

56:41.943 --> 56:45.280
Bini is still struggling to trust me
that I am coming back.

56:48.158 --> 56:50.660
Look. Look at my closet.

56:50.744 --> 56:54.831
You see all this stuff,
you know I'm not leaving forever.

56:54.914 --> 56:56.124
Ta-da!

57:20.857 --> 57:24.527
I'm supposed to leave now, you know,
like, I don't really have time.

57:25.904 --> 57:29.407
You didn't take my passport again,
did you?

57:40.627 --> 57:46.174
Yesterday, Bini got really mad
and he hid my passport from me.

57:46.257 --> 57:49.469
I was very upset and felt like

57:49.552 --> 57:53.098
that was like an aggressive...
act towards me.

57:53.181 --> 57:56.309
But I do understand that
he's not acting like himself

57:56.393 --> 58:00.230
because he's so traumatised by
what happened with his ex-wife.

58:00.313 --> 58:03.316
So I do forgive him
for hiding the passports,

58:03.400 --> 58:07.237
and he did give them back to me
almost immediately, so...

58:22.836 --> 58:24.963
Avi needs a hernia surgery

58:25.046 --> 58:28.758
and then, like, my parents,
they really want to see Avi,

58:28.842 --> 58:30.844
my family want to meet Avi.

58:39.978 --> 58:41.730
Will you sit down with me?

58:43.815 --> 58:45.900
I want to tell you something.

59:02.167 --> 59:03.543
I wrote it.

59:03.626 --> 59:06.463
I wrote it because I didn't want
to forget the words.

59:06.546 --> 59:08.340
Don't read it while I'm reading.

59:19.184 --> 59:22.020
Oh, my God, now I won't be able
to open it.

59:22.103 --> 59:23.772
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

59:27.275 --> 59:29.486
I would like if you give me your...

59:29.569 --> 59:32.322
(LAUGHING)
OK, like, if you give me your...

59:35.492 --> 59:36.951
OK, OK.

59:38.703 --> 59:40.288
OK, all right.

59:40.372 --> 59:42.707
Um...OK.

59:42.791 --> 59:44.292
Give me your hand.

59:47.253 --> 59:49.756
I don't think it's fitting
on this finger.

59:52.300 --> 59:55.011
Now you can't take this off
ever again, OK?

59:57.681 --> 1:00:02.602
Oh, but I want to show you,
I forget, what the ring says inside.

1:00:05.939 --> 1:00:07.357
"Forever Family."

1:00:12.070 --> 1:00:14.155
I'm hoping that, by Bini seeing

1:00:14.239 --> 1:00:18.868
that I invested the time and the
forethought to buy us matching rings

1:00:18.952 --> 1:00:21.329
that it'll reassure Bini
that I am coming back,

1:00:21.413 --> 1:00:23.832
and maybe will ease his suffering
a little bit.

1:00:23.915 --> 1:00:25.333
I love you, baby.

1:00:52.110 --> 1:00:54.154
I don't know what to do.

1:00:54.237 --> 1:00:56.781
She messaged me a bunch of things.

1:00:56.865 --> 1:00:58.616
She said...

1:00:58.700 --> 1:01:01.161
"I knew you were lying to me.

1:01:01.244 --> 1:01:05.582
"I always know things
and I knew there was something more.

1:01:06.958 --> 1:01:08.752
"You were lying.

1:01:08.835 --> 1:01:11.755
"I questioned you,
and you lied to my face.

1:01:12.922 --> 1:01:15.717
"You said there was no more things,
but there were.

1:01:15.800 --> 1:01:18.678
"You're a liar
and a piece of garbage,

1:01:18.762 --> 1:01:20.638
"and forget about me."

1:01:20.722 --> 1:01:22.432
That's what she said.

1:01:22.515 --> 1:01:23.683
So...

1:01:26.353 --> 1:01:28.772
I don't know.
I don't know what to do.

1:01:29.939 --> 1:01:31.274
This sucks.

1:01:34.402 --> 1:01:38.365
I told Evelin about the full
relationship I had with Jenny,

1:01:38.448 --> 1:01:42.494
and I feel like I've just
completely ruined everything.

1:01:42.577 --> 1:01:46.664
She finally started trusting me
in the relationship.

1:01:46.748 --> 1:01:49.584
And when I came clean,
it just completely broke

1:01:49.668 --> 1:01:51.503
all trust that she has with me.

1:01:51.586 --> 1:01:55.340
I am not 100% confident if I'll ever
be able to get that trust back.

1:04:18.066 --> 1:04:21.236
I've seen Evelin get this mad
before, but...

1:04:22.987 --> 1:04:24.906
..there's only been one other time

1:04:24.989 --> 1:04:27.701
when she told me to actually,
physically leave.

1:04:27.784 --> 1:04:31.621
And that was when I ended up meeting
Jenny and everything, you know,

1:04:31.705 --> 1:04:33.248
and all that.

1:04:33.331 --> 1:04:36.334
Usually, she just says,
sleep in the room next door

1:04:36.418 --> 1:04:40.839
and we'll talk about it later,
and usually we resolve our issues.

1:04:42.590 --> 1:04:46.886
But she doesn't even want me to stay
there, she said leave, like, leave.

1:04:46.970 --> 1:04:48.763
So...

1:04:57.272 --> 1:05:00.483
I have a separate room
where I stay when we fight,

1:05:00.567 --> 1:05:02.527
to give Evelin her space.

1:05:03.820 --> 1:05:07.282
But I just texted her
and she said not to talk to her,

1:05:07.365 --> 1:05:11.911
and she took the key to the room,
not to sleep in the room, so...

1:05:16.291 --> 1:05:19.294
Don't really know
how I'm going to fix this.

1:05:19.377 --> 1:05:21.004
I just know that...

1:05:21.087 --> 1:05:23.840
I really have to give it my all.

1:05:46.529 --> 1:05:49.240
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
like...

1:05:49.324 --> 1:05:52.327
I've got a hammock I can set up,
stay the night,

1:05:52.410 --> 1:05:55.914
and I just hope that she'll...
come to her senses

1:05:55.997 --> 1:05:58.958
and want to work through things
at some point, but...

1:06:00.251 --> 1:06:02.128
I don't know what to do.

1:06:53.388 --> 1:06:54.431
Yeah.

1:06:56.349 --> 1:06:58.018
OK.

1:07:02.564 --> 1:07:05.275
Last night, Sumit and I talked to...

1:07:05.358 --> 1:07:08.820
Sumit's parents, with the help
of a family counsellor.

1:07:10.280 --> 1:07:11.823
Oh, monkeys!

1:07:14.576 --> 1:07:17.704
She helped his parents understand,
she made them listen.

1:07:17.787 --> 1:07:22.292
But the one thing
that I wasn't ready to hear was

1:07:22.375 --> 1:07:26.171
that Sumit's mom is wanting
to come and move in with us

1:07:26.254 --> 1:07:29.215
and train me how to become
a traditional Indian wife.

1:07:32.927 --> 1:07:36.139
They won't try to, like,
sit on my head or anything?

1:07:36.222 --> 1:07:37.891
Oh, my God!

1:07:50.570 --> 1:07:53.031
A lot of change has happened
really quickly here.

1:07:54.657 --> 1:07:57.369
Your mom's talking about
moving in with us.

1:07:58.620 --> 1:08:02.082
Why's she going to come and live
with us if we're not married?

1:08:22.477 --> 1:08:25.021
Having Sumit's mom living with us
in our house,

1:08:25.105 --> 1:08:27.107
after everything we've been through,

1:08:27.190 --> 1:08:33.863
that is not gonna work,
that doesn't appeal to me at all.

1:08:37.492 --> 1:08:39.577
No, I'm confused.

1:08:39.661 --> 1:08:42.038
She wants me gone,
so I just can't...

1:08:42.122 --> 1:08:44.499
She's up to something,
and what I think...

1:08:44.582 --> 1:08:46.793
what I'm thinking she's up to is,

1:08:46.876 --> 1:08:50.005
I'm gonna come and make Jenny's life
a hell,

1:08:50.088 --> 1:08:54.175
and then Jenny will run out of India
so fast and I'll get my son back.

1:08:59.723 --> 1:09:03.685
Because she doesn't like me. I don't
care what she says, she doesn't.

1:09:10.191 --> 1:09:13.361
What you're asking me to do
is a very big thing.

1:09:13.445 --> 1:09:17.032
They're gonna come in and start
telling me how to run my house,

1:09:17.115 --> 1:09:19.117
how to live my life in my own house.

1:09:19.200 --> 1:09:21.953
I might have a little bit
of a problem with that.

1:09:30.795 --> 1:09:33.423
They're expecting more from me,
I think.

1:09:33.506 --> 1:09:35.550
Like, how much more?

1:09:35.633 --> 1:09:39.346
I mean, I got back on a plane
and flew back here for a third time.

1:09:39.429 --> 1:09:42.682
This time, I thought we were gonna
get married for sure.

1:09:42.766 --> 1:09:44.517
I had every faith in the world,

1:09:44.601 --> 1:09:47.812
I would have fought with anybody
who said you weren't.

1:09:49.647 --> 1:09:51.358
But now, here I sit...

1:09:51.441 --> 1:09:53.818
looking pretty damn stupid,
actually.

1:09:58.823 --> 1:10:02.911
Sumit does ask a lot of me,
and I go along with all of it,

1:10:02.994 --> 1:10:07.374
because I love him so much, and I do
want to be with him here in India.

1:10:08.708 --> 1:10:12.796
But asking me to let his parents
come and live with me...

1:10:12.879 --> 1:10:15.048
that's asking a little bit too much.

1:10:18.259 --> 1:10:21.930
How do you expect so much from me,
and you keep avoiding marrying me?

1:10:37.612 --> 1:10:38.738
So am I.

1:10:52.669 --> 1:10:56.965
I realise this is an opportunity
that Sumit really can't turn down.

1:10:57.048 --> 1:11:01.469
But I feel like Sumit might be
blinded by his mom's intentions.

1:11:03.513 --> 1:11:05.098
I mean, that's his mother.

1:11:05.181 --> 1:11:08.852
Maybe he wants to believe
that her intentions are very good.

1:11:08.935 --> 1:11:13.857
I'm just the sceptical one because
I'm the one that's hated by her.

1:11:13.940 --> 1:11:17.944
So, I mean, I still think they're
trying to get me out of India.

1:11:18.028 --> 1:11:19.946
I still think the same way.

1:11:25.243 --> 1:11:27.996
I can't say right now
if I will or if I won't.

1:11:28.079 --> 1:11:29.456
Just give me some time.

1:11:34.544 --> 1:11:37.339
OK, right now there's a whole lot
of monkeys...

1:11:37.422 --> 1:11:39.924
(SCREECHING)
Oh, oh!

1:11:40.008 --> 1:11:41.217
Oh!

1:11:42.719 --> 1:11:44.846
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

1:11:46.431 --> 1:11:50.393
This is insane, I've never seen
anything like this in my life.

1:11:52.687 --> 1:11:54.314
I'm so scared.

1:11:54.397 --> 1:11:55.982
Oh, my gosh!

1:12:17.087 --> 1:12:19.673
Earlier today, I gave Bini
an engagement ring

1:12:19.756 --> 1:12:22.676
to prove to him
that I am coming back to Ethiopia.

1:12:22.759 --> 1:12:24.552
(WHISTLES)

1:12:24.636 --> 1:12:28.556
I'm just really hoping he doesn't
fall apart before I get on the plane

1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:31.476
because if he falls apart
and begs me not to leave,

1:12:31.559 --> 1:12:33.353
I wouldn't have the strength to go.

1:12:49.786 --> 1:12:51.830
(AVI CRYING)

1:12:53.248 --> 1:12:54.708
(CRYING)

1:13:08.346 --> 1:13:10.557
I'm gonna miss you so much, baby.

1:13:11.933 --> 1:13:13.643
You know I love you.

1:13:16.229 --> 1:13:18.648
This'll be the first time
I've been back home

1:13:18.732 --> 1:13:20.900
since I moved to Ethiopia
11 months ago.

1:13:20.984 --> 1:13:23.153
Don't take off this ring.

1:13:26.197 --> 1:13:28.324
Leaving Ethiopia is bittersweet.

1:13:28.408 --> 1:13:31.119
On the one hand,
I don't want to leave Bini,

1:13:31.202 --> 1:13:35.582
and it's really hard
to see him like this,

1:13:35.665 --> 1:13:38.501
but the doctor said
Avi needs the surgery

1:13:38.585 --> 1:13:41.671
and I'm also really excited
to see my family

1:13:41.755 --> 1:13:43.423
and to see my friends

1:13:43.506 --> 1:13:48.386
and to experience all those things
I can't get from the US in Ethiopia.

1:14:29.719 --> 1:14:31.388
(AVI CRYING)

1:14:31.471 --> 1:14:33.390
I know, babe. We'll miss you too.

1:14:33.473 --> 1:14:36.768
It's not forever.
After this, baby, we have forever.

1:14:41.940 --> 1:14:43.817
Please don't be too sad when I go.

1:14:43.900 --> 1:14:45.193
OK?

1:14:48.530 --> 1:14:50.615
Can you call me every day?

1:14:50.699 --> 1:14:52.575
I'll call you, you call me.

1:14:54.494 --> 1:14:56.746
(AVI GURGLING)

1:15:07.424 --> 1:15:09.467
He's a very stubborn baby.

1:15:11.386 --> 1:15:14.681
I'm just doing this cos I think
it's the right thing to do.

1:15:14.764 --> 1:15:18.435
I know you'll miss him, baby,
but it's good for him.

1:15:18.518 --> 1:15:21.646
He'll get his surgery,
then come back brand new, OK?

1:15:34.367 --> 1:15:35.744
Don't even talk about that.

1:15:35.827 --> 1:15:38.163
That would never happen.
That will not happen.

1:15:38.246 --> 1:15:41.666
I mean, I'm shocked that you think
that I won't come back

1:15:41.750 --> 1:15:43.460
because you guys are my family.

1:15:44.627 --> 1:15:46.129
I know.

1:15:46.212 --> 1:15:48.298
You're not the same guy
I met before,

1:15:48.381 --> 1:15:50.675
you're much better
than when I met you.

1:15:50.759 --> 1:15:53.970
Yeah, much better. A family guy.

1:15:54.054 --> 1:15:58.141
You're really trying to change and
be better and showing your emotions,

1:15:58.224 --> 1:15:59.893
you're doing a really good job

1:15:59.976 --> 1:16:03.271
and I really appreciate you
and everything you've done for us.

1:16:07.275 --> 1:16:08.651
I know.

1:16:14.657 --> 1:16:16.576
I feel so sad because...

1:16:16.659 --> 1:16:20.538
it's just one of the hardest things
I have to do, to leave Bini behind.

1:16:21.956 --> 1:16:23.083
Bye.

1:16:23.166 --> 1:16:26.586
I hope he understands
this is the right thing and that...

1:16:26.670 --> 1:16:30.715
when I do come back, it will make us
happier and stronger.

1:16:42.477 --> 1:16:44.813
(AVI CRYING)

1:17:01.663 --> 1:17:03.289
(AVI CRYING)

1:17:06.751 --> 1:17:09.421
At least I'll have Avi
to cuddle at night.

1:17:09.504 --> 1:17:11.673
You don't have anyone to cuddle.

1:17:11.756 --> 1:17:13.341
I'm sorry for you.

1:17:41.703 --> 1:17:44.080
(SOBBING)

1:17:48.543 --> 1:17:50.295
I love you, baby.

1:18:01.056 --> 1:18:02.766
Don't be sad.

1:18:02.849 --> 1:18:04.517
I love you too, OK?

1:20:19.486 --> 1:20:23.323
I thought I was going to be sleeping
in the hammock outside, but...

1:20:23.406 --> 1:20:26.659
she said I could sleep in here,
so...

1:20:48.848 --> 1:20:51.101
Having the night
to think about it...

1:20:51.184 --> 1:20:52.977
I hope that she can be

1:20:53.061 --> 1:20:56.481
a little more level-headed
on everything in this situation.

1:21:38.898 --> 1:21:40.358
You know, it's just...

1:21:40.442 --> 1:21:44.404
It makes me wonder if I should have
even said anything cos it's...

1:21:44.487 --> 1:21:47.198
it's...so long ago and...

1:21:48.616 --> 1:21:52.704
You know, it's in the past and we
weren't even together at the time.

1:21:52.787 --> 1:21:54.456
Like I said, it doesn't...

1:21:55.582 --> 1:21:59.044
I mean, I'm glad I told her,
I got it off my chest, but...

1:21:59.127 --> 1:22:02.630
it makes me wonder if it was even
worth it, or if I should have.

1:22:02.714 --> 1:22:07.260
You know, I screwed up, we all make
mistakes and I'm just trying to...

1:22:07.344 --> 1:22:11.765
come clean about everything,
everything.

1:22:11.848 --> 1:22:14.851
And I hope that we can...

1:22:16.227 --> 1:22:19.773
..rebuild what we had and...

1:22:21.149 --> 1:22:23.818
We must have been together
seven years.

1:22:23.902 --> 1:22:25.653
It would be a shame...

1:22:26.738 --> 1:22:30.492
..if she didn't give me
at least one last chance.

1:22:50.595 --> 1:22:52.389
I am really nervous to talk to her

1:22:52.472 --> 1:22:55.183
and I really hope we can
work through our problems,

1:22:55.266 --> 1:22:58.186
but I really have no idea
what the outcome is gonna be.

1:22:58.269 --> 1:23:00.980
I really hope we can fix this.

1:23:04.275 --> 1:23:07.612
I'm hoping Evelin will,
after a night's sleep,

1:23:07.696 --> 1:23:11.533
come to the realisation that what
I did was the right thing to do,

1:23:11.616 --> 1:23:14.077
that it was for me and Evelin's
relationship.

1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:18.081
I'm holding on to hope that she was
just really caught up in the moment,

1:23:18.164 --> 1:23:21.751
didn't know how to process the
information I told her correctly,

1:23:21.835 --> 1:23:23.962
so I can convince her
to forgive me.

1:23:27.590 --> 1:23:29.217
Mind if I sit down?

1:23:41.688 --> 1:23:44.691
Do you mind if I talk with you
about what happened?

1:23:54.701 --> 1:23:56.536
I understand that.

1:23:58.872 --> 1:24:01.166
I understand and respect that.

1:24:02.417 --> 1:24:04.502
First off, I'd like to start...

1:24:04.586 --> 1:24:06.546
by saying...

1:24:06.629 --> 1:24:08.673
that I made...

1:24:08.757 --> 1:24:10.800
a big mistake.

1:24:10.884 --> 1:24:14.346
And...I hope that we can
talk about this

1:24:14.429 --> 1:24:16.681
and we can work through this.

1:24:16.765 --> 1:24:19.642
I...I know you...
I know you don't want to,

1:24:19.726 --> 1:24:23.438
and I know you're disgusted by me
and you have a right to do that,

1:24:23.521 --> 1:24:26.649
but what I want you to know is...
I will never...

1:24:35.533 --> 1:24:38.453
I do very much.
Well, it doesn't show.

1:24:51.633 --> 1:24:56.680
You speak to me, and I don't know
what is real and what is not.

1:25:11.027 --> 1:25:12.278
I did.

1:25:19.828 --> 1:25:20.870
I...

1:25:35.093 --> 1:25:37.804
She's not somebody who cries.

1:25:37.887 --> 1:25:39.639
It's very rare.

1:25:39.723 --> 1:25:43.685
So to see Evelin break down and cry,
because of something I did,

1:25:43.768 --> 1:25:45.353
is just...

1:25:45.437 --> 1:25:46.813
it's...

1:25:46.896 --> 1:25:51.985
so...horrible to know that
you're the person causing this.

1:25:54.029 --> 1:25:57.824
I don't know how...
how else to better explain it,

1:25:57.907 --> 1:26:01.411
but it is one of the worst feelings
you can have.

1:26:11.338 --> 1:26:12.714
I know.

1:27:26.705 --> 1:27:28.748
I don't know what to say right now

1:27:28.832 --> 1:27:32.419
cos I don't know if it's gonna...
make anything better.

1:27:33.753 --> 1:27:37.632
I don't know if this is the right
time to talk about this cos...

1:28:07.746 --> 1:28:11.332
I don't like to think that me
and Evelin's relationship is over.

1:28:12.459 --> 1:28:15.837
But I think it's a very strong
possibility that it is.

1:28:41.363 --> 1:28:44.574
I almost feel like I don't deserve
to be with her any more.

1:28:44.657 --> 1:28:47.077
This is how I feel, you know.

1:28:47.160 --> 1:28:49.329
As bad as I want to be with her...

1:28:50.872 --> 1:28:53.333
..I'm realising that I made

1:28:53.416 --> 1:28:57.170
a much bigger mistake
than I originally realised.

1:28:58.463 --> 1:29:00.632
And I wish I could take it all back.

1:29:00.715 --> 1:29:01.758
100%.

1:29:10.558 --> 1:29:13.812
Next time on
90 Day Fiance: The Other Way...

1:29:13.895 --> 1:29:17.816
One of the things I wanted
to talk to you about

1:29:17.899 --> 1:29:20.276
was the whole cheating incident.

1:29:20.360 --> 1:29:22.028
I need to look him in the eyes

1:29:22.112 --> 1:29:24.739
and I want to feel secure
about his answers.

1:29:24.823 --> 1:29:27.659
He sent me a lot of pictures of you

1:29:27.742 --> 1:29:29.994
and you looked pretty happy.

1:29:30.078 --> 1:29:33.623
You guys were talking about, like,
having kids.

1:29:36.543 --> 1:29:41.798
My goal is to see if I can convince
you guys to come and be near us.

1:29:41.881 --> 1:29:45.510
I've committed myself to live
in Ethiopia, to build a life there.

1:29:45.593 --> 1:29:47.595
I love you, but you need to wake up.

1:29:47.679 --> 1:29:51.141
You did your little thing,
you had the baby in Ethiopia,

1:29:51.224 --> 1:29:53.810
now you've got to get real
about life.

1:29:55.186 --> 1:29:56.896
I just want to have a baby.

1:29:58.898 --> 1:30:00.066
You don't want it?

1:30:00.150 --> 1:30:03.903
I would rather help a kid
than make a kid.

1:30:03.987 --> 1:30:07.574
I do think of the battle,
with my family, with the government,

1:30:07.657 --> 1:30:10.326
and everything we'd have
to go through to adopt.

1:30:10.410 --> 1:30:13.872
It just makes me question how long
the process is gonna take.

1:30:20.128 --> 1:30:22.339
I live in a completely different
country

1:30:22.422 --> 1:30:24.215
than my whole, entire...everyone.

1:30:24.299 --> 1:30:28.845
I was under the impression Sumit
was happy living the way we live.

1:30:28.928 --> 1:30:31.097
You can visit them any time.

1:30:31.181 --> 1:30:33.308
Can I go visit my daughters
any time?

1:30:35.685 --> 1:30:38.188
All you want to do is
argue and fight with me.

1:31:16.434 --> 1:31:18.770
If Evelin serves me
with divorce papers now,

1:31:18.853 --> 1:31:20.355
I'll rip them up in her face.
