- [wolf growling]

00:13.822 --> 00:15.773
[Peter screaming]

00:17.117 --> 00:18.901
[panting]

00:19.661 --> 00:22.121
I can't help wondering how you found us.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.907
Hard not to follow a trail of bodies.

00:25.208 --> 00:26.917
The trailer park.

00:26.918 --> 00:29.711
The kid you tried to
run over and then drown.

00:29.712 --> 00:31.622
You must be very proud.

00:33.216 --> 00:36.627
The boy on the tricycle. That was you.

00:40.015 --> 00:44.226
- How many more have you butchered?
- Too many.

00:44.227 --> 00:48.897
That kid you thought you saved,
his life was all that was required.

00:48.898 --> 00:52.818
If you hadn't interfered,
Mom would still be alive.

00:52.819 --> 00:56.238
- That's on you.
- But you did find us,

00:56.239 --> 00:58.490
by the grace of God.

00:58.491 --> 01:00.659
It means we're close to
completing our mission.

01:00.660 --> 01:03.753
Slaughtering families and murdering
children, that's your mission?

01:03.754 --> 01:06.332
We mourn every life taken.

01:06.333 --> 01:10.961
But it's God's will, to
save the souls of so many...

01:10.962 --> 01:12.629
I don't know what fucking
God you believe in,

01:12.630 --> 01:14.249
but you're a bunch of sick fucks.

01:15.175 --> 01:19.053
They always say that about
those who bring disruption.

01:19.054 --> 01:23.132
Noah, for instance.
Then it started raining.

01:26.978 --> 01:29.138
Who sent you?

01:30.899 --> 01:34.352
Why don't you ask your God? It
sounds like he has all the answers.

01:41.326 --> 01:44.695
Where is the beast?
The child you're protecting?

01:46.998 --> 01:50.076
I'm not telling you dick.

01:52.670 --> 01:56.707
Suffering brings enlightenment.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.839

[eerie, melancholic theme music plays]

03:10.999 --> 03:13.834
Peter, where are you? I
got your half-assed message.

03:13.835 --> 03:15.377
You better not try to do this without me.

03:15.378 --> 03:18.623
Miranda's home alone with
Nadia. I'm worried. Call me back.

03:21.217 --> 03:23.135
- How are you feeling?
- Peachy keen.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.137
It's a big day for you.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.722
I just reviewed the latest
results from your last session,

03:27.723 --> 03:30.184
and I'm pleased to report
that your sed rate indicates

03:30.185 --> 03:32.769
a robust monoclonal erythrocytic rebound.

03:32.770 --> 03:36.773
After your last treatment
today, your upir retroviral load

03:36.774 --> 03:39.567
will be so low, we won't even
be able to detect its presence.

03:39.568 --> 03:43.356
You will, in effect, be symptom
free, the hunger will be gone.

03:46.451 --> 03:51.455
- What's wrong?
- Something's come up... with the baby.

03:51.456 --> 03:55.792
- Wh... Is she sick?
- We need to postpone.

03:55.793 --> 03:57.711
- No, no, you can't.
- I can do what I want.

03:57.712 --> 03:59.713
You are at a critical juncture.

03:59.714 --> 04:01.423
If you don't go through
with this final treatment,

04:01.424 --> 04:04.676
the most virulent and
resistant retroviral fragments

04:04.677 --> 04:07.804
will rush into the microbial
void, multiplying unchecked,

04:07.805 --> 04:10.807
rebonding to your DNA, causing
them to mutate with unpredictable

04:10.808 --> 04:12.760
and potentially catastrophic results.

04:14.145 --> 04:16.397
It will be virtually
impossible to eradicate.

04:16.398 --> 04:19.726
All of our gains, all of your
suffering will be for naught.

04:20.527 --> 04:23.563
Fine. Let's get this
fucking thing over with.

04:26.074 --> 04:28.192
We just need to get you prepped.

04:29.577 --> 04:31.904
What do you wanna do today, little miss?

04:34.040 --> 04:35.499
[Nadia babbling]

04:35.500 --> 04:37.410
[Miranda] Oooh...

04:40.004 --> 04:43.332
No, no, no, those aren't for eating, silly.

04:45.218 --> 04:47.378
No, no.

04:48.221 --> 04:51.432
- Peekaboo!
- [babbling]

04:51.433 --> 04:54.642
- Peekaboo!
- [babbling continues]

04:54.643 --> 04:56.471
Peekaboo!

04:59.107 --> 05:01.058
Did you do that?

05:07.365 --> 05:09.317
Peekaboo!

05:16.031 --> 05:17.832
Call me as soon as Mr.
Godfrey is out of prep.

05:17.833 --> 05:21.795
- What the hell did you do now?
- I've done many things.

05:21.796 --> 05:24.131
- Could you be more specific?
- Maybe you could tell me why

05:24.132 --> 05:25.966
that Barbie doll you whipped up downstairs

05:25.967 --> 05:27.627
is pretending to be my daughter!

05:29.137 --> 05:32.722
I replicated Shelley's consciousness
and transferred it to a perfect host.

05:32.723 --> 05:35.434
I'm giving her a chance
at a life she's never had,

05:35.435 --> 05:38.479
a life free from ridicule and persecution.

05:38.480 --> 05:42.142
You have no right to perform
your experiments on my children!

05:42.143 --> 05:43.728
Cut the shit, Olivia!

05:43.729 --> 05:45.688
You have the maternal
instincts of an arachnid.

05:45.689 --> 05:47.857
Don't pretend you care about Shelley.

05:47.858 --> 05:51.151
How dare you question my
feelings for my daughter.

05:51.152 --> 05:53.821
When she was a baby, you
couldn't stand to hold her.

05:53.822 --> 05:55.573
When she disappeared, you were relieved.

05:55.574 --> 05:58.659
You couldn't even hide your look
of revulsion when she came back.

05:58.660 --> 06:00.786
- That's a vicious lie.
- Roman was right.

06:00.787 --> 06:04.407
The only thing you've ever been a
mother to are your own selfish desires.

06:08.086 --> 06:12.749
So... tell me why you're really here.

06:16.135 --> 06:19.380
[sighs] I'm dying.

06:26.979 --> 06:29.981
- As we discussed...
- You've created life in a laboratory.

06:29.982 --> 06:32.150
Why can't you use the
same process to save mine?

06:32.151 --> 06:34.612
Olivia, it's apples and oranges.

06:34.613 --> 06:37.823
Upir DNA isn't compatible
with the genetic sequencing.

06:37.824 --> 06:41.410
But I've fed on your failed
experiments and they've sustained me.

06:41.411 --> 06:44.079
Wouldn't it stand to reason
that your perfected achievement

06:44.080 --> 06:46.498
would not only sustain, but rejuvenate me?

06:46.499 --> 06:49.877
You're grasping at straws, Olivia.
Why would you even think this?

06:49.878 --> 06:52.421
What am I supposed to do, give up and die?

06:52.422 --> 06:55.374
Have you been talking to
Dr. Zheleznova-Burdukovskaya?

06:57.677 --> 07:01.054
She's leading you on. You have
no idea who that woman really is.

07:01.055 --> 07:04.092
And God save us all from her
agenda, whatever it turns out to be.

07:10.523 --> 07:14.025
In any case, you have
the finest oncologist.

07:14.026 --> 07:17.822
In fact, I was just talking about
a new treatment that shows promise:

07:17.823 --> 07:20.741
the extraction of an enzyme
found only in the seeds

07:20.742 --> 07:23.076
of the Zingiberiflorae family.

07:23.077 --> 07:28.332
It replaces nutrients required by
the cancer cells with empty calories.

07:28.333 --> 07:32.670
Junk food, in essence, allowing
your body to reabsorb the cancer

07:32.671 --> 07:34.964
and process it through
your digestive tract.

07:34.965 --> 07:36.632
Just stay the course,

07:36.633 --> 07:41.171
and rest in the knowledge that
every day brings new miracles.

07:42.597 --> 07:45.223
Thank you for the encouragement.

07:45.224 --> 07:48.636
- I'm here to help.
- Of course you are.

07:54.818 --> 07:58.278
[soft beeping]

07:58.279 --> 08:00.398
[elevator slows, stops]
[bell dings]

08:07.205 --> 08:10.207
Mother, behold your son.

08:10.208 --> 08:13.828
After today, the filth that you
infected me with will be gone.

08:18.591 --> 08:21.010
Time for second-guessing is passed.

08:21.011 --> 08:24.471
This is our last opportunity.
You must be strong.

08:24.472 --> 08:26.640
He's my blood.

08:26.641 --> 08:29.393
He's your enemy, the
cause of your suffering.

08:29.394 --> 08:33.014
- Mercy is for the weak.
- Maybe there's another way.

08:34.024 --> 08:38.485
"Death is the solution to all
problems. No man, no problem."

08:38.486 --> 08:41.063
Comrade Stalin said that.

08:41.948 --> 08:44.198
What do you know about Zingiberiflorae...

08:44.200 --> 08:50.205
Seeds? Is crackpot cancer
treatment fad, totally discredited.

08:50.206 --> 08:53.659
- Why?
- No reason.

09:19.360 --> 09:21.562
[knocking on door]

09:29.788 --> 09:33.082
Hey. Come in. Thanks for coming.

09:33.083 --> 09:36.167
Not a problem. What's going on?

09:36.168 --> 09:39.705
Uh... This, um...

09:41.883 --> 09:43.668
This is for you.

09:45.845 --> 09:49.394
You know, I appreciate, really
appreciate everything you've done...

09:49.395 --> 09:52.977
I... I can't accept this.
This is quadruple my...

09:52.978 --> 09:57.564
Combat pay. Take the money,
and the advice that you gave me.

09:57.565 --> 10:00.275
Get out of this town.

10:00.276 --> 10:03.445
There's nothing good here for anyone.

10:03.446 --> 10:05.823
Thank you.

10:05.824 --> 10:08.276
So, what are you gonna do?

10:09.035 --> 10:13.872
Uh... Well, I always wanted
to spend a winter in Paris,

10:13.873 --> 10:17.876
or... any other place
far, far away from here.

10:17.877 --> 10:20.371
Before I lose my fucking mind.

10:22.007 --> 10:23.882
Ah, you're doing the right thing.

10:23.883 --> 10:25.884
Sooner or later, Olivia's
gonna make a mistake.

10:25.885 --> 10:27.992
She's gonna have to
answer for what she's done.

10:27.993 --> 10:31.515
I was trained to believe that
monsters were codified in myth

10:31.516 --> 10:34.810
to deal with the fears of the subconscious.

10:34.811 --> 10:38.472
Now, I find that I've been
sleeping with one for...

10:39.357 --> 10:40.558
... twenty years.

10:43.862 --> 10:45.855
Well...

10:47.740 --> 10:51.777
- Take care of yourself, Norman.
- Yeah. You too.

10:55.915 --> 10:57.658
[door closing]

11:11.848 --> 11:13.966
That's all I have.

11:19.064 --> 11:22.524
I'll make the necessary preparations.

11:22.525 --> 11:26.562
He'll need to come with
me for a period of time.

11:27.864 --> 11:30.649
- How long?
- As long as it takes.

11:31.617 --> 11:35.738
- What are you gonna do to him?
- It's best you do not know.

12:12.242 --> 12:15.326
[Leticia] You better think this
through long and hard, Norman.

12:15.327 --> 12:19.538
Blinding me with dollar signs so you
can sneak away and whack your girlfriend?

12:20.077 --> 12:21.792
What are you talking about?

12:21.793 --> 12:24.996
Don't you think I know when
someone's trying to get over on me?

12:27.090 --> 12:29.334
So, what, are you following me now?

12:30.551 --> 12:33.804
From your office to the gun store to here.

12:33.805 --> 12:36.424
You decide to go with the hollow points?

12:38.059 --> 12:40.309
[sighs]

12:40.310 --> 12:42.680
You know what she is...

12:43.773 --> 12:45.808
... what she's done.

12:46.734 --> 12:51.113
Even if you manage to kill her,
the cops are gonna grab you up.

12:51.114 --> 12:53.899
And don't think for a second
that I won't testify against you.

12:56.326 --> 12:59.447
She destroyed my family.

13:02.834 --> 13:06.962
[sighs] It's a pretty day.

13:06.963 --> 13:08.747
Last looks, Norman.

13:09.507 --> 13:12.626
Lying in wait will get you special
circumstances and the needle.

13:14.344 --> 13:16.546
You need to go now.

13:19.142 --> 13:21.010
Or what?

13:22.478 --> 13:24.680
You gonna kill me too?

13:27.192 --> 13:29.143
Give me the gun.

14:02.894 --> 14:05.846
[door opening]

14:06.898 --> 14:08.891
Where is she?!

14:14.697 --> 14:18.484
You tell that backstabbing
Cossack to come find me!

14:22.955 --> 14:24.873
[man] No time for sleep.

14:24.874 --> 14:28.244
- [gasping]
- We still got miles to go.

14:32.506 --> 14:35.217
Quicksilver.

14:35.218 --> 14:38.129
One of the few things
that'll kill a demon like you.

14:39.805 --> 14:43.842
I believe your people
refer to it as mercur.

14:44.727 --> 14:47.972
Do you know how many thermometers
I had to break to fill this?

14:52.026 --> 14:55.438
It's got its own word in
Gypsy for the kind of pain.

14:56.781 --> 15:00.067
[screaming]

15:01.035 --> 15:04.989
[screaming continues]

15:06.791 --> 15:09.076
I must have been thinking
of a different word.

15:10.169 --> 15:12.212
[agonized groaning]

15:12.213 --> 15:14.415
[softly] Enough.

15:16.550 --> 15:20.429
Why are you willing to suffer
like this to protect a child

15:20.430 --> 15:22.673
who will destroy us all?

15:25.684 --> 15:28.312
Are you so far gone you
can't see what you're doing,

15:28.313 --> 15:31.315
unleashing hell on earth?

15:31.316 --> 15:35.152
We both want the same
thing: stop the killing.

15:35.153 --> 15:37.647
But you hold the key.

15:41.451 --> 15:43.027
Tell me where I'll find the demon.

15:45.079 --> 15:47.956
"A gaze blank and pitiless as the sun,

15:47.957 --> 15:52.495
while all about it, the
darkness drops again

15:53.838 --> 15:55.588
But I know

15:55.589 --> 16:00.051
that twenty centuries of stony sleep

16:00.052 --> 16:02.087
were vexed to nightmare

16:03.014 --> 16:05.716
by a rocking cradle

16:06.809 --> 16:08.427
And what rough beast,

16:09.228 --> 16:11.396
its hour come round at last...

16:11.397 --> 16:13.357
Were vexed to nightmare...

16:13.358 --> 16:17.936
Slouches towards Bethlehem to be born?"

16:21.324 --> 16:24.652
Let's give him time to
sit with his thoughts.

16:39.091 --> 16:41.801
- [knocking on door]
- Hey, boss. You have a visitor.

16:41.802 --> 16:45.506
- The smoking-hot PI.
- Send her in.

16:50.228 --> 16:52.804
What can I do for you, Miss Padilla?

16:53.647 --> 16:56.358
I just stopped Norman Godfrey
from murdering his girlfriend.

16:56.359 --> 17:01.021
- That's quite an accusation.
- We both know he has motive.

17:02.365 --> 17:04.324
Means.

17:04.325 --> 17:07.785
And me showing up at the front door
just put a kibosh on his opportunity.

17:07.786 --> 17:10.163
He's not thinking straight.
He's gonna try it again.

17:10.164 --> 17:14.000
Well, he's got a carry
permit, hasn't broken any laws.

17:14.001 --> 17:16.336
I can't put him in preventative
detention without a court order.

17:16.337 --> 17:17.921
Lean on him.

17:17.922 --> 17:20.464
Tell him he's under surveillance.
Do whatever the fuck you have to.

17:20.465 --> 17:23.093
- Just keep him away from her.
- I appreciate the heads-up.

17:23.094 --> 17:25.921
- I'll look into it.
- Thank you.

17:27.181 --> 17:30.308
I was writing my report about
our conversation the other day.

17:30.309 --> 17:33.061
Olivia Godfrey... Um...

17:33.062 --> 17:35.897
You said you... you lifted
her prints from her residence?

17:35.898 --> 17:37.566
Yeah.

17:37.567 --> 17:39.727
Was she home at the time?

17:40.445 --> 17:43.280
- [picks up phone]
- [dialing]

17:43.281 --> 17:46.283
- [line ringing]
- [phone ringing nearby]

17:46.284 --> 17:48.653
Deputy, moment of your time.

17:49.537 --> 17:51.530
Where are you going with this?

17:53.958 --> 17:56.418
Take Miss Padilla into custody.

17:56.419 --> 17:59.129
Trespassing and suspicion of B and E.

17:59.130 --> 18:00.547
What? What are you doing?

18:00.548 --> 18:01.881
My job.

18:01.882 --> 18:04.842
[Leticia] What? What... Get
your fucking hands off me!

18:04.843 --> 18:07.220
What the hell... Get... [grunts]

18:07.221 --> 18:09.047
Get off of me!

18:15.104 --> 18:18.223
[taking deep breaths]

18:33.956 --> 18:36.707
[bones cracking]

18:36.708 --> 18:39.453
[gasping]

18:44.091 --> 18:46.335
[wolf growling]

18:58.772 --> 19:01.350
Your PI friend came by my office today.

19:06.071 --> 19:08.739
- Am I under arrest?
- I want Olivia Godfrey dead

19:08.740 --> 19:10.025
just as much as you do.

19:17.583 --> 19:19.910
She killed my sister.

19:20.794 --> 19:22.830
I'm sorry.

19:24.173 --> 19:27.467
I came to this town to
find the person responsible.

19:27.468 --> 19:30.713
And now I want to put her in the ground.

19:35.560 --> 19:39.471
- Why haven't you?
- She suspects I'm onto her.

19:40.314 --> 19:43.058
She'd see me coming a mile away.

19:44.276 --> 19:45.569
But she trusts you.

19:45.570 --> 19:49.280
You'll be able to get in close.

19:49.281 --> 19:51.942
Why is that important?

20:09.510 --> 20:11.253
[yelling]

20:13.055 --> 20:15.883
You fucker! You're fucking dead!

20:47.757 --> 20:49.291
[grunting]

20:58.058 --> 21:01.846
[engine starting]

21:11.155 --> 21:14.441
- [line ringing]
- Goddamn it.

21:16.452 --> 21:19.738
- [dialing]
- [line ringing]

21:21.457 --> 21:24.083
- Answer, motherfucker!
- [dialing]

21:24.084 --> 21:26.169
[phone ringing]

21:26.170 --> 21:29.380
- Destiny, listen to me.
- Oh! Thank God you finally picked up.

21:29.381 --> 21:31.215
I've been trying you
for hours. Where are you?

21:31.216 --> 21:32.717
Meet me at Roman's house right now!

21:32.718 --> 21:35.136
- What happened?
- I'll explain when I see you.

21:35.137 --> 21:37.214
Just get over there right now.

21:40.225 --> 21:41.760
[dialing]

21:42.687 --> 21:44.596
[line ringing]

21:47.483 --> 21:51.353
[cell phone vibrating]

22:00.954 --> 22:02.907
[phone chiming]

22:04.916 --> 22:06.334
[knocking]

22:06.335 --> 22:09.038
How's my girl?

22:09.839 --> 22:12.632
- What are you reading?
- A book about twins.

22:12.633 --> 22:15.343
How they can feel each other's emotions.

22:15.344 --> 22:17.922
Just like Prycilla and I.

22:19.931 --> 22:22.517
- I have some good news.
- What?

22:22.518 --> 22:25.687
Your consciousness transfer to
Prycilla is a complete success.

22:25.688 --> 22:29.357
I know. I could feel it happen.

22:29.358 --> 22:31.735
That means there's a new you.

22:31.736 --> 22:34.772
One that doesn't have to be afraid anymore.

22:38.826 --> 22:40.986
Thank you.

22:43.205 --> 22:47.166
This means that we're now
ready to move into phase three.

22:47.167 --> 22:51.588
It's OK, Uncle Johann. I understand.

22:51.589 --> 22:55.049
It's time for this body to go away now.

22:55.050 --> 22:57.502
I'm ready.

22:58.763 --> 23:02.098
- Does anyone else know?
- No one.

23:02.099 --> 23:05.810
The only people who will be
notified are Norman and Roman.

23:05.811 --> 23:10.139
Once the... procedure is complete.

23:11.901 --> 23:16.821
So, what do you think you're
going to do with your new life?

23:16.822 --> 23:19.532
Put on a bikini and learn how to surf.

23:19.533 --> 23:21.860
[chuckles]

23:23.995 --> 23:26.163
This is what I want.

23:26.164 --> 23:28.617
The opportunity to start again.

23:29.418 --> 23:31.419
Then we should move quickly.

23:31.420 --> 23:34.589
I want to see my mother first.

23:34.590 --> 23:37.584
Are you going to tell
her about the transfer?

23:38.385 --> 23:40.386
No.

23:40.387 --> 23:42.464
Let her think I'm dead.

23:57.987 --> 23:59.690
Mom?

24:02.367 --> 24:04.368
I'm still not used to hearing you speak.

24:04.369 --> 24:07.956
I'm not used to moving my
lips and having words come out.

24:07.957 --> 24:11.076
Dr. Pryce said it was
physiologically impossible.

24:11.919 --> 24:14.705
We all make mistakes, Mother.

24:16.340 --> 24:18.125
I should have done more to help you.

24:19.426 --> 24:23.296
- I want to apologize.
- For what?

24:24.473 --> 24:27.558
Having me for a daughter
must have been so hard.

24:27.559 --> 24:30.895
To look at me every day and see
something you felt so much guilt

24:30.896 --> 24:33.063
and responsibility for.

24:33.064 --> 24:36.317
I understand why you
wanted to keep me hidden.

24:36.318 --> 24:39.813
To protect me. I wanted to hide too.

24:42.950 --> 24:46.778
You loved me the best way you could.

24:50.165 --> 24:55.286
Love is... not something I know how to do.

24:57.673 --> 25:01.091
When Roman played the Tin
Man in the fourth grade,

25:01.092 --> 25:05.053
I remember you staying up late
for days making his costume.

25:05.054 --> 25:07.306
You cried when he came onstage.

25:07.307 --> 25:09.099
I was so nervous for him.

25:09.100 --> 25:11.936
He had such stage fright.
He kept... [sniffling]

25:11.937 --> 25:16.265
He forgot to say "oil can," and
just stood there the whole time.

25:17.150 --> 25:20.820
I've seen the way Uncle
Norman looks at you.

25:20.821 --> 25:24.114
I'd give anything for someone
to look at me like that.

25:24.115 --> 25:26.193
Just once.

25:28.161 --> 25:30.747
I've been so selfish.

25:30.748 --> 25:33.499
You found love.

25:33.500 --> 25:37.621
And in this world, that's a good thing.

25:45.220 --> 25:47.256
I haven't been a good mother.

25:48.097 --> 25:49.841
I made it harder.

25:51.393 --> 25:53.061
Can we start it again?

25:53.062 --> 25:57.147
It'll be better this time, I promise.

25:57.148 --> 25:59.059
Yes, of course.

26:03.321 --> 26:05.482
Goodbye.

26:55.874 --> 26:58.417
Dr. Pryce asked me to give you something

26:58.418 --> 27:01.621
to help with pain during procedure.

27:14.977 --> 27:16.345
[vibrating]

27:18.313 --> 27:20.140
I will be back.

27:21.775 --> 27:25.603
[phone continues vibrating]

27:26.488 --> 27:28.648
[phone chimes]

27:37.248 --> 27:39.910
[table whirring]

27:55.224 --> 27:57.267
[rapid beeping]

27:57.268 --> 28:01.014
[multiple machines beeping]

28:05.234 --> 28:09.189
May all my enemies turn to ash.

28:24.838 --> 28:26.214
Open the fucking door.

28:26.215 --> 28:28.375
- [gasps]
- Now!

28:30.552 --> 28:34.881
And if you tell anyone I'm down here,
I'll put your head on a goddamn spike.

28:37.726 --> 28:40.061
[door opening]

28:40.062 --> 28:42.680
[rapid beeping continues]

29:18.725 --> 29:21.102
[whirring]

29:21.103 --> 29:23.347
[groaning]

29:26.066 --> 29:28.393
[grunting]

29:29.486 --> 29:30.979
[elevator dings]

29:32.363 --> 29:34.816
- Where's my son?
- He's gone.

29:36.441 --> 29:39.162
He didn't go through with the
treatment. Your legacy is still secure.

29:39.163 --> 29:40.489
He will remain upir.

29:41.123 --> 29:43.867
[Roman groaning]

29:49.589 --> 29:52.091
Something happened. Something amazing.

29:52.092 --> 29:54.927
Shelley can speak. The
Tin Man found a heart.

29:54.928 --> 29:56.804
I'm sure I have no idea
what you're talking about.

29:56.805 --> 29:59.389
I don't have to be this person, me.

29:59.390 --> 30:03.220
Olivia, we really do need to talk
about your fondness for Merlot.

30:04.104 --> 30:07.940
It's not Merlot, Johann. I've
been guzzling from the cup of life.

30:07.941 --> 30:10.193
- Keep your silly experiment.
- [alarm beeping]

30:10.194 --> 30:14.613
I choose Norman and happiness
for my son and daughter.

30:14.614 --> 30:18.326
I'd rather die from a malignant
tumor than continue to live like one.

30:18.327 --> 30:21.446
[alarm continues beeping]

30:44.061 --> 30:45.554
Oh, my.

30:53.320 --> 30:55.445
[groans softly]

30:55.446 --> 30:58.074
- We need to get him to a hospital.
- No.

30:58.075 --> 31:00.944
[doorbell rings]

31:11.129 --> 31:12.747
He's in there.

31:14.841 --> 31:17.927
Can you just tell me that
he's gonna be all right?

31:17.928 --> 31:21.222
What I can tell you is...

31:21.223 --> 31:25.434
... when I return him, the
vargulf will be cast out.

31:25.435 --> 31:28.513
What I cannot tell you is
whether he'll be alive or dead.

31:29.981 --> 31:36.104
But it is certain that if it is
not done, more death will follow.

31:41.034 --> 31:43.702
- Who's this?
- I think you should listen to him.

31:43.703 --> 31:45.662
Because you sure as hell
aren't listening to me.

31:45.663 --> 31:48.874
How many times have you
turned against the cycle?

31:48.875 --> 31:52.120
- What have you told him about me?
- Everything.

31:58.551 --> 32:02.172
A gift from my father.

32:04.682 --> 32:06.759
He turned on wrong moons.

32:10.063 --> 32:14.225
The look in your eyes
is the same as his was.

32:16.236 --> 32:18.862
Your body is deteriorating.

32:18.863 --> 32:21.365
- Get the hell out of here.
- We're trying to help you.

32:21.366 --> 32:24.201
What the fuck, Destiny?! How
could you be so goddamn stupid?

32:24.202 --> 32:25.786
Those butchers are out hunting Nadia,

32:25.787 --> 32:28.289
and you think this is the best
possible moment to stage some sort of

32:28.290 --> 32:31.208
- bullshit vargulf intervention?
- Now is the only chance that you have.

32:31.209 --> 32:33.710
Please, you have to go with him
because it's beyond my powers

32:33.711 --> 32:35.879
- to help you anymore.
- I'm not going anywhere.

32:35.880 --> 32:39.216
Yeah, but you're gonna be no good
to anyone if you're dead. No...

32:39.217 --> 32:42.379
- Just get the fuck off me!
- What are you doing?!

32:45.056 --> 32:46.716
I'm sorry.

32:55.984 --> 32:58.902
The gift you were given...

32:58.903 --> 33:00.855
... has been perverted.

33:05.035 --> 33:07.577
If you call on the wolf again,

33:07.578 --> 33:09.538
you will belong to him.

33:09.539 --> 33:12.950
Unable to return.

33:16.505 --> 33:18.665
We don't have much time.

33:19.757 --> 33:21.459
Let me help you.

33:22.635 --> 33:24.678
[Conway] You people have no business here!

33:24.679 --> 33:27.515
This is a home, not a frat house!

33:27.516 --> 33:28.891
- So you people...
- [glass breaks]

33:28.892 --> 33:30.301
[Conway gasping]

33:31.895 --> 33:34.021
- [glass breaks]
- [arrow whistles past]

33:34.022 --> 33:36.357
- [Miranda] What the fuck is happening?
- Go to the baby's room.

33:36.358 --> 33:37.983
Lock yourselves in right now.

33:37.984 --> 33:40.186
- Yeah, but what about...
- Just do it! Do it!

33:42.906 --> 33:44.490
[arrows whistling]

33:44.491 --> 33:47.235
[electrical charge whines]

33:54.834 --> 33:56.035
[grunts]

34:15.105 --> 34:16.514
[grunts]

34:32.121 --> 34:34.364
[grunts]

34:35.958 --> 34:37.661
[man] Take his head.

34:39.463 --> 34:41.581
- [thwacks]
- [man groaning]

34:46.928 --> 34:48.505
[man groans]

34:51.516 --> 34:53.641
- Where are Miranda and the baby?
- Upstairs.

34:53.643 --> 34:55.411
Get them, and get the hell out of here!

35:05.029 --> 35:07.573
[whispers] It's OK, sweetheart. [sniffling]

35:07.574 --> 35:09.609
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

35:10.952 --> 35:14.455
- What are you doing?
- I gotta see if he's OK.

35:14.456 --> 35:15.824
Please don't, they'll kill you!

35:17.208 --> 35:19.076
Please, don't leave me!

35:26.676 --> 35:27.960
[man shouts]

35:29.095 --> 35:30.596
Grab the child!

35:30.597 --> 35:32.256
[Destiny gasps]

35:34.017 --> 35:35.218
[grunts]

35:37.479 --> 35:39.514
[man screams]

35:43.943 --> 35:46.563
Leave her alone, you son of a bitch.

35:54.829 --> 35:56.781
[bones cracking]

35:59.000 --> 36:00.167
[Peter groans]

36:00.168 --> 36:01.828
[groaning, growling]

36:03.672 --> 36:06.089
Come into my house to kill my child?!

36:06.090 --> 36:07.417
[man yells]

36:09.678 --> 36:12.054
[man screams]

36:12.055 --> 36:14.591
[snarling]

36:20.647 --> 36:21.890
[grunts]

36:25.068 --> 36:27.520
[gasps]

36:37.622 --> 36:40.749
Please, please! No, no! [gasps]

36:40.750 --> 36:42.376
Motherfucker!

36:42.377 --> 36:44.169
[grunts]

36:44.170 --> 36:47.582
[pounding on door continues]

36:48.341 --> 36:50.877
Praise God.

36:54.431 --> 36:59.677
[high-pitched tone whining]

37:00.937 --> 37:03.598
[screams]

37:06.651 --> 37:08.895
[Roman panting]

37:10.363 --> 37:12.565
[Nadia babbling]

37:13.700 --> 37:15.860
[Roman] Are you OK?

37:17.579 --> 37:19.823
He just started bleeding.

37:36.306 --> 37:38.883
I love you so much.

37:44.481 --> 37:46.231
She loves you too.

37:46.232 --> 37:48.601
You're her father.

37:49.944 --> 37:52.396
[wolf snarling]

37:56.951 --> 38:00.530
- Why isn't he changing back?
- [Destiny] He can't.

38:03.416 --> 38:04.617
Stay back.

38:06.961 --> 38:10.088
Peter, it's me.

38:10.089 --> 38:11.548
Don't do this.

38:11.549 --> 38:13.543
[growling]

38:15.261 --> 38:18.130
[feral snarling]

38:26.356 --> 38:28.224
Please, Peter.

38:35.239 --> 38:36.406
[wolf whimpers]

38:36.407 --> 38:39.068
- You're killing him.
- [Roman grunting]

38:40.704 --> 38:42.697
[wolf whimpers]

39:09.482 --> 39:12.560
[trembling breaths]

39:23.120 --> 39:25.330
[Chasseur] Wasn't sure
if you were gonna to show.

39:25.331 --> 39:27.324
Let's just do this.

39:28.959 --> 39:31.370
You can walk away and
your hands are still clean.

39:32.171 --> 39:35.041
But once we go through this
door, there's no turning back.

40:13.504 --> 40:16.057
There must be something we can
do, someone we can take him to.

40:17.007 --> 40:20.176
Well, the only other person I
know of is dead in the other room.

40:20.177 --> 40:22.345
- [wolf snarls]
- [screams]

40:22.346 --> 40:25.265
[Destiny] Hey! Hey, it's OK. It's OK.

40:25.266 --> 40:26.767
It's OK, it's OK.

40:26.768 --> 40:29.303
[panting]

40:39.656 --> 40:44.534
- It's over.
- Yeah. Yeah.

40:44.535 --> 40:46.453
[Chasseur] My sister said
upirs are hard to kill.

40:46.454 --> 40:50.415
Decapitation and cremation
are the only ways to kill them.

40:50.416 --> 40:52.501
The latter gets rid of the evidence.

40:52.502 --> 40:56.964
So dinner and a movie, tie her to a
fucking stake, and set her on fire?

40:56.965 --> 40:59.048
I want you to stab Olivia in the heart.

40:59.049 --> 41:01.134
- But I thought you said that I...
- It won't kill her.

41:01.135 --> 41:03.720
But a direct strike to the heart
will put her down long enough

41:03.721 --> 41:05.806
for us to move the body
someplace where we can torch it.

41:05.807 --> 41:07.975
Jesus Christ.

41:07.976 --> 41:10.602
We need to make sure the blade
is coated with an anticoagulant.

41:10.603 --> 41:14.314
Something like, uh, heparin.
It's not a problem, right?

41:14.315 --> 41:16.726
[sighs] No.

41:24.116 --> 41:26.986
- What the fuck is this? I mean...
- Practice.

41:27.787 --> 41:29.947
You only get one shot.

41:31.666 --> 41:36.204
Aim under the sternum, and twist
upwards and towards the spine.

41:36.963 --> 41:39.130
I'm a doctor, I know where the heart is.

41:39.131 --> 41:41.584
Then show me.

41:46.263 --> 41:48.557
- Oh! Shit.
- [knife clatters]

41:48.558 --> 41:54.013
Good thing you're a
psychiatrist, not a surgeon.

41:55.982 --> 41:58.350
Aim lower, thrust up.

42:04.114 --> 42:05.608
Again.

42:07.785 --> 42:09.987
- [grunts]
- Again.

42:14.667 --> 42:17.661
[machines beep softly]

42:43.071 --> 42:45.731
Please forgive me.

42:52.204 --> 42:53.781
