WEBVTT

01:27.975 --> 01:34.075
O great American multitude, and sports fans everywhere.

01:34.175 --> 01:39.275
Today we inaugurate the 20th annual
Transcontinental Road Race.

01:39.375 --> 01:43.774
Today the five bravest young men and women

01:43.874 --> 01:46.774
in this bravest of nations

01:46.874 --> 01:48.474
will risk their lives

01:48.574 --> 01:52.574
in the greatest sporting event
since the days of Spartacus.

01:52.674 --> 01:57.874
Three days hence, a new American
champion will be crowned,

01:57.974 --> 02:01.973
for all the world to behold in awe,

02:01.974 --> 02:03.674
in respect,

02:03.774 --> 02:05.374
in fear.

02:05.474 --> 02:10.873
All right, all right. This is Junior Bruce,
your buddy-buddy and mine.

02:10.973 --> 02:14.272
And I'll be giving you the blow-by-blow play-by-play

02:14.273 --> 02:18.773
when the kings and queens
of the open road roar onto the track.

02:18.873 --> 02:21.373
<i>Do I hear the sound of engines?</i>

02:21.473 --> 02:25.273
It's "Calamity" Jane Kelly, queen of the road,

02:25.373 --> 02:28.873
at the wheel of that mean old ornery stud Bull.

02:32.773 --> 02:36.172
Zany Janie, winner of this year's trials at Watkins Glen,

02:36.272 --> 02:38.271
placed second in 1998

02:38.272 --> 02:42.672
and led at last year's second lap
until she went out with gear trouble.

02:42.772 --> 02:47.372
Her fans and lovers everywhere
wish Janie better luck this year.

02:47.472 --> 02:49.672
My fans can wish me all the luck they want.

02:49.772 --> 02:53.272
If my luck with my lovers gets any better,
I'll miss the race completely.

02:53.372 --> 02:56.172
Isn't that right, Pete?

02:56.272 --> 02:59.372
With the start of the race only a heartthrob away,

02:59.472 --> 03:02.871
this is Grace Pander on the spot - as usual -

03:02.971 --> 03:06.070
to welcome the greatest racer of all time,

03:06.071 --> 03:09.271
and a very dear friend of mine.

03:09.371 --> 03:14.571
Yes, in just a moment
he will be coming through the doors!

03:20.871 --> 03:22.871
There is no cause for alarm.

03:22.971 --> 03:26.970
The patient has been flown in from abroad
in a state of suspended animation

03:26.971 --> 03:31.270
in order to facilitate the healing
of his recent limb transplants.

03:31.370 --> 03:34.770
He should be coming around any moment now.

03:37.570 --> 03:40.570
<i>Oh, my... I don't believe it!</i>

03:45.770 --> 03:50.670
Frankenstein, can you give me
an exclusive? How are things abroad?

03:50.770 --> 03:54.169
How is Mr. President? Is he still in Moscow?

03:54.269 --> 04:00.269
<i>Mr. President is in his summer palace in Peking.</i>

04:00.369 --> 04:02.169
He loves everybody.

04:02.269 --> 04:04.869
And everybody loves him.

04:04.969 --> 04:06.868
<i>- Sieg!
- Heil!</i>

04:06.869 --> 04:11.368
Here she is, that adorable swastika sweetheart,

04:11.369 --> 04:14.569
Matilda the Hun from Milwaukee!

04:14.669 --> 04:20.768
And her lovable Nazi navigator, Herman "the German" Bock!

04:29.368 --> 04:30.768
Matilda, Herman,

04:30.868 --> 04:35.968
do you think this is your turn to be
first and foremost in sunny California?

04:36.068 --> 04:38.468
- Today, California.
- Tomorrow, the world.

04:38.568 --> 04:41.068
Hiya, Herman.

04:41.168 --> 04:46.168
I hope your Buzz Bomb has a little more
juice in its warhead this year.

04:49.667 --> 04:52.267
Whoever named your car the Bull,

04:52.367 --> 04:54.767
was only half right!

04:54.867 --> 04:58.867
Frankenstein, will Mr. President fly in
to crown the winner of the race?

04:58.967 --> 04:59.666
Yes.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.066
Is it true that with your new mechanical arm

05:02.067 --> 05:04.967
you can shift gears in less than a twentieth of a second?

05:05.067 --> 05:08.266
- Would you care to comment on that?
- No.

05:08.267 --> 05:11.967
How do you feel about going into the race
with a navigator you've never met?

05:12.067 --> 05:15.066
You'll love Annie. She's a red-hot sexpot.

05:15.166 --> 05:17.666
She better be a red-hot navigator.

05:20.566 --> 05:21.866
No more questions.

05:21.966 --> 05:28.166
<i>It's the Lion! And at the wheel,
Ray "Nero the Hero" Lonnegan.</i>

05:28.266 --> 05:30.465
Never has finished the Transcontinental,

05:30.466 --> 05:35.166
but three big wins in the provinces
this season plus a brand-new beast

05:35.266 --> 05:38.165
means Nero's not fiddling around.

05:38.166 --> 05:41.865
Sit still, Cleopatra, and stop blocking me.

05:41.965 --> 05:44.365
My fans wanna see me.

05:44.465 --> 05:46.665
They've never seen a has-been before?

05:53.765 --> 05:56.265
- Annie Smith?
- Mr. Frankenstein.

05:57.465 --> 06:00.265
I've checked out the car, and everything seems perfect.

06:00.365 --> 06:05.365
- I have the route maps right here.
- I will check them in a minute.

06:06.464 --> 06:08.063
We will roll...

06:08.064 --> 06:11.164
when everything seems perfect...

06:11.264 --> 06:12.364
to me.

06:12.464 --> 06:14.763
I've packed some high-protein capsules

06:14.764 --> 06:17.664
and as many adrenaline tablets as I could find.

06:17.764 --> 06:22.563
And I've also assembled a medical kit,
just in case. I'm trained as a nurse.

06:22.564 --> 06:25.863
I don't need a nurse. I need a navigator.

06:25.864 --> 06:30.464
Mr. Frankenstein, you're very good at what you do,

06:30.564 --> 06:33.163
and I'm very good at what I do.

06:33.263 --> 06:35.363
We'll see.

06:36.563 --> 06:42.063
And you know there's only one person
who guns an engine like that.

06:42.163 --> 06:45.763
It's gotta be the roughest tough guy of 'em all,

06:45.863 --> 06:49.563
"Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo!

06:51.763 --> 06:54.163
Here he comes - Machine Gun Joe.

06:54.263 --> 06:57.662
Loved by thousands, hated by millions.

06:57.663 --> 07:00.961
Only living previous winner except for Frankenstein.

07:00.962 --> 07:03.862
Highest lifetime score after Frankenstein.

07:03.962 --> 07:07.862
And he's certainly getting the welcome he deserves.

07:10.962 --> 07:16.962
Joe doesn't look too happy, but you can't
keep those Frankenstein fans down.

07:17.462 --> 07:20.261
Lousy sons of bitches.

07:20.262 --> 07:22.462
- Frankenstein?
- Give it to them, Joe.

07:22.562 --> 07:24.562
<i>You want Frankenstein?</i>

07:24.662 --> 07:27.161
I'll give you Frankenstein.

07:31.161 --> 07:31.861
Yeah!

07:31.961 --> 07:34.060
Here he comes! Here he comes!

07:34.061 --> 07:35.761
<i>Frankenstein!</i>

07:35.861 --> 07:40.660
Frankenstein the legend! Frankenstein the indestructible!

07:40.661 --> 07:44.261
Sole survivor of the titanic pileup of '95.

07:44.361 --> 07:47.560
Only two-time winner of the Transcontinental Road Race.

07:47.561 --> 07:49.661
Frankenstein -

07:49.761 --> 07:53.960
ripped up, wiped out, battered,
shattered, creamed and reamed!

07:54.060 --> 07:56.360
A dancer on the brink of death.

07:56.460 --> 08:01.360
Frankenstein, who lost a leg in '98, an arm in '99.

08:01.460 --> 08:06.960
With half a face and half a chest
and all the guts in the world, he's back!

08:07.060 --> 08:11.959
God only knows what he looks like
under that mask, but he is back.

08:11.960 --> 08:17.260
In the name of Mr. President,
America loves you, Frankenstein.

08:28.759 --> 08:31.359
You will regret that, Joe.

08:36.459 --> 08:37.858
Stay tuned, racing fans.

08:37.859 --> 08:43.758
T- video satellite will bring every mile of
thrills and spills into your living room.

08:43.759 --> 08:48.257
All five cars are in starting position
here at New York Memorial Raceway,

08:48.258 --> 08:50.158
ready to roll.

08:50.258 --> 08:55.558
<i>Now we take you to the Summer Palace. And Mr. President.</i>

09:09.658 --> 09:11.457
My children,

09:11.458 --> 09:14.856
whom I love so dearly,

09:14.857 --> 09:17.056
it has been my duty

09:17.057 --> 09:20.057
in the long and difficult years

09:20.157 --> 09:23.457
since the world crash of '79

09:23.557 --> 09:27.257
to serve you as best I could.

09:27.357 --> 09:32.056
Never before in history
have the masses forgone all comfort

09:32.057 --> 09:34.757
so that the spirit of genius might thrive

09:34.857 --> 09:39.556
and seek the golden key to a new time of plenty

09:39.656 --> 09:42.956
in the fertile field of minority privilege.

09:43.056 --> 09:47.955
<i>And now. My children. The drivers
are ready. The world is waiting.</i>

09:47.956 --> 09:52.256
Once more, I give you what you want.

10:04.356 --> 10:08.755
Good morning, Americans.
Once again the race is under way,

10:08.855 --> 10:11.955
with 12-hour pit stops scheduled at St Louis

10:12.055 --> 10:16.155
and Albuquerque, home of the American Indian Museum.

10:16.255 --> 10:20.555
At this very moment the cars are howling
through the streets of Manhattan,

10:20.655 --> 10:24.055
but no points have been scored as yet.

10:24.155 --> 10:26.554
<i>Take it away. Junior Bruce.</i>

10:26.555 --> 10:28.655
<i>They're at the Lincoln Tunnel.</i>

10:28.755 --> 10:31.753
<i>With Frankenstein and Joe running neck and neck.</i>

10:31.754 --> 10:36.054
<i>Then it's the Lion. Driven by...
Passed by Calamity Jane in the Bull.</i>

10:36.154 --> 10:38.254
<i>Moving into third place.</i>

11:42.352 --> 11:44.652
All right, and hey, hey, hey!

11:44.752 --> 11:49.452
The cars have split up, the drivers
taking off on their favorite routes.

11:49.552 --> 11:52.351
<i>Frankenstein's still out in front. Headed due west.</i>

11:52.451 --> 11:56.251
<i>With Nero the Hero on his tail
hoping to pick up his leftovers.</i>

11:56.351 --> 11:58.550
<i>Calamity Jane's on a northwest tack.</i>

11:58.551 --> 12:02.151
<i>Matilda's Buzz Bomb is trying
to catch up with Machine Gun Joe.</i>

12:02.251 --> 12:04.151
<i>Now streaking southwest.</i>

12:04.251 --> 12:06.451
<i>Once again - Mr. President.</i>

12:06.551 --> 12:09.951
<i>I have made the United Provinces of America</i>

12:10.051 --> 12:12.850
<i>the greatest power in the known universe.</i>

12:12.851 --> 12:15.251
<i>I have also given you</i>

12:15.351 --> 12:19.850
<i>the most popular sporting event
in the history of mankind -</i>

12:19.950 --> 12:22.250
<i>the Transcontinental Road Race.</i>

12:22.350 --> 12:24.650
<i>Which upholds the American tradition</i>

12:24.750 --> 12:27.250
<i>of no holds barred!</i>

12:27.350 --> 12:30.650
"No holds barred."

12:30.750 --> 12:32.949
That's how he got to be president.

12:32.950 --> 12:35.350
Hypocrite pig! What about our ultimatum?

12:35.450 --> 12:37.650
He's been laughing us off for 15 years.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.150
Passive resistance means nothing to him.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.349
Pick up that flag, young man.

12:42.350 --> 12:43.850
It's time for action.

12:43.950 --> 12:46.149
It is not a time for violence.

12:46.249 --> 12:48.549
Mrs. Paine, I love Annie as much as you do.

12:48.649 --> 12:53.449
But she's no match for Frankenstein,
and we can't risk letting him get away.

12:53.549 --> 12:57.149
Frankenstein is the biggest target in
the world and a friend of Mr. President.

12:57.249 --> 13:03.249
That, Lieutenant Fury, is exactly why
they'll call off the race. To save his life.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.149
<i>My granddaughter will succeed.</i>

13:05.249 --> 13:07.349
Don't you ever take off that mask?

13:07.449 --> 13:10.649
No. Don't you know about my face?

13:10.749 --> 13:12.948
I've heard stories.

13:14.148 --> 13:16.448
Nobody's ever seen it, have they?

13:16.548 --> 13:18.748
Except my other navigators.

13:18.848 --> 13:22.047
And they're all dead.

13:22.048 --> 13:24.348
So they are.

13:26.648 --> 13:31.448
They say you lost most of your jaw in the crash of '92.

13:31.548 --> 13:34.447
And my right eye in '95,

13:34.448 --> 13:37.248
and my nose and my left eye in '97,

13:37.347 --> 13:39.647
and most of my cranium in '98.

13:39.747 --> 13:44.147
I'm held together with
patches of plastic and steel plates.

13:44.247 --> 13:47.646
It's not a pretty sight.

13:47.647 --> 13:50.146
You wanna see?

13:50.147 --> 13:52.446
Why not? I've seen everything else.

13:52.447 --> 13:57.647
Remember, you're doing this on your own.
I take no responsibility.

14:10.046 --> 14:13.846
What'd you expect? Another pretty face?

14:17.946 --> 14:21.245
- They really love you, Joe.
- Yeah?

14:21.246 --> 14:25.346
Then how come they ain't
down here on the road provin' it?

14:25.446 --> 14:29.246
Hey, you better make this left turn.
You'll shave off about 2 miles that way.

14:29.346 --> 14:31.245
Yeah, all right.

14:51.045 --> 14:54.344
All right, all right and yes, siree!

14:54.345 --> 14:59.743
A clean hit! A perfect hit! And no pain for the target.

14:59.744 --> 15:02.044
<i>Too bad the guy was only 38.</i>

15:02.144 --> 15:05.444
Just two years older, he'd have been
worth three times the points.

15:05.544 --> 15:07.644
But, for the second year in a row,

15:07.744 --> 15:12.344
Machine Gun Joe has splattered the scoreboard first.

15:12.444 --> 15:17.144
How'd you like that, huh?
Get off on that one, Myra, baby?

15:18.544 --> 15:23.143
- What's the matter with this engine?
- I don't know. Sounds fine to me.

15:23.144 --> 15:25.742
Amateurs.

15:25.743 --> 15:30.743
Get back there and retard the spark four...
uh, three degrees.

16:12.942 --> 16:16.541
I'm glad to see you were able to find your way back.

16:21.341 --> 16:24.341
<i>As the cars roar into Pennsylvania.
The cradle of liberty.</i>

16:24.741 --> 16:29.140
<i>It seems apparent that our citizens
are staying off the streets.</i>

16:29.141 --> 16:32.241
<i>Which may make scoring particularly difficult.</i>

16:32.341 --> 16:34.840
<i>Even with this year's rule changes.</i>

16:34.841 --> 16:38.140
<i>To recap those revisions -</i>

16:38.141 --> 16:43.840
<i>women are still worth 10 points
more than men in all age brackets.</i>

16:43.940 --> 16:47.539
<i>But teenagers now rack up 40 points.</i>

16:47.540 --> 16:49.940
<i>And toddlers under 12</i>

16:50.040 --> 16:52.740
<i>now rate a big 70 points.</i>

16:52.840 --> 16:58.939
<i>The big score - anyone. Any sex. Over 75 years old</i>

16:58.940 --> 17:02.439
<i>has been upped to 100 points.</i>

17:02.440 --> 17:04.339
<i>As always.</i>

17:04.340 --> 17:09.340
<i>How fast you move determines how long you live.</i>

17:17.839 --> 17:19.639
<i>Toro!</i>

17:54.838 --> 17:58.238
A beautiful kill! A neat kill!

17:58.338 --> 18:01.438
No calamities for Jane today. No, sir.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.537
And you can bet she'll be getting both ears for that one.

18:17.837 --> 18:19.437
What is that?

18:19.537 --> 18:23.137
Euthanasia day at the geriatrics hospital.
They do it every year.

18:23.237 --> 18:26.337
Here he comes! He's coming!

18:48.236 --> 18:52.936
Frankenstein scores! Frankenstein scores at last!

18:53.036 --> 18:55.235
But what kind of a score, boys and girls?

18:55.236 --> 19:00.935
Just 110 points out of a possible big 700.
What do you think about that, Gracie?

19:01.035 --> 19:06.035
Well, those doctors - dear friends of mine -

19:06.135 --> 19:09.534
have been pretty smug all these years,
setting up the old folks.

19:09.535 --> 19:12.835
Frankenstein must have decided it was their turn.

19:12.935 --> 19:16.735
Which only goes to show that
even the fearsome Frankenstein

19:16.835 --> 19:22.134
<i>has a 100% red-blooded American sense of humor.</i>

19:22.734 --> 19:27.134
Annie saved those old people!
And she'll deliver Frankenstein.

19:27.234 --> 19:31.834
Meanwhile, innocent people
are being slaughtered on our highways.

19:31.934 --> 19:35.834
They're like Christians being thrown to the gladiators.

19:35.934 --> 19:39.034
But just remember, the Christians won.

19:39.134 --> 19:40.533
Did they, Mrs. Paine?

19:40.534 --> 19:45.333
I take it from your attire that your
sabotage operations are being carried out,

19:45.334 --> 19:48.434
despite my wishes?

19:48.534 --> 19:53.633
Mrs. Paine, we're set to hit 'em
with everything we've got.

19:53.733 --> 19:56.332
<i>Then. In the name of humanity.</i>

19:56.333 --> 19:59.733
<i>Let Operation Anti-Race begin.</i>

20:07.733 --> 20:10.733
How in hell are we supposed to score in this graveyard?

20:10.833 --> 20:13.533
You're the navigator. That's your problem.

20:13.633 --> 20:17.032
And think of something soon,
or else you're gonna be out on your ass.

20:17.132 --> 20:20.032
It isn't my fault everyone scored before us.

20:20.132 --> 20:22.732
You should have hit that boy scout camp like I told you.

20:22.832 --> 20:25.532
I tried the god dammed boy scout camp.

20:25.632 --> 20:28.632
You know how fast those boy scouts move?

20:30.132 --> 20:32.531
Now, here's something more your speed.

20:32.532 --> 20:35.331
Gotta be at least 200 points.

20:35.332 --> 20:37.632
If they scatter, go for the baby and the mother.

20:39.232 --> 20:42.231
Come on! Quick! Quick!

20:43.431 --> 20:46.031
Go for the baby! The baby!

20:46.131 --> 20:49.231
That's it. Come get baby.

20:49.331 --> 20:53.231
Bye-bye, baby. Hello, 70 points.

20:57.531 --> 20:59.730
<i>Hey! I'm off the air!</i>

20:59.731 --> 21:02.830
Would you please take your places?

21:02.831 --> 21:05.330
Put Grace on with an interview, right now.

21:05.331 --> 21:09.930
Hello, ladies. Isn't this just
the most exciting race in years?

21:10.030 --> 21:12.329
I certainly think so.

21:12.330 --> 21:15.029
And guess what - I have a surprise for you.

21:15.030 --> 21:21.430
Mrs. Rhonda Bainbridge, in person, on my show.

21:21.530 --> 21:26.130
The widow of Edward Bainbridge, whom, as we all know,

21:26.230 --> 21:31.030
was "Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo's first score.

21:31.130 --> 21:35.929
Welcome to my home. And may I call you Rhonda?

21:36.029 --> 21:37.729
Please do, Mrs. Pander.

21:37.829 --> 21:41.429
- Are we about ready here?
- Yeah, just about.

21:41.529 --> 21:44.329
Listen, we have to go right away.

21:46.229 --> 21:49.829
<i>As the widow of the race's first score.</i>

21:49.929 --> 21:55.729
<i>You have won a high-style two-room apartment in Acapulco!</i>

21:55.829 --> 21:58.229
Start the jam!

22:11.328 --> 22:14.428
<i>And next year you will be watching the race</i>

22:14.528 --> 22:20.028
<i>on a 50-inch three-dimensional octaphonic T-video set...</i>

22:20.128 --> 22:22.928
<i>Fellow oppressed Americans.</i>

22:23.028 --> 22:26.928
<i>The execution of the barbarian killer Nero the Hero</i>

22:27.028 --> 22:29.526
<i>is the people's first stroke</i>

22:29.527 --> 22:35.626
<i>against the evil and corrupt regime of Mr. President.</i>

22:35.627 --> 22:37.827
I am Thomasina Paine,

22:37.927 --> 22:41.627
founder and commander of the army of the resistance.

22:41.727 --> 22:47.927
<i>For 20 years. Americans have been
told when to eat and when to sleep.</i>

22:48.027 --> 22:51.227
<i>When to love and when to hate.</i>

22:51.627 --> 22:56.226
<i>The age of obedience is over.</i>

22:56.326 --> 23:02.226
In the names of George Washington,
Abraham Lincoln, and Harry Truman,

23:02.726 --> 23:07.026
I call upon you to stand up for your inalienable rights.

23:07.626 --> 23:12.626
We declare war upon
the Bipartisan Party, on Mr. President,

23:12.726 --> 23:18.425
and on that most inhuman desecration of life and liberty,

23:18.426 --> 23:22.025
the Transcontinental Road Rape.

23:22.125 --> 23:23.125
I thank you.

23:25.125 --> 23:28.825
<i>- What the hell was that?
- I have no information.</i>

23:28.925 --> 23:32.125
<i>- Is this race still on?
- I have no information.</i>

23:32.225 --> 23:34.125
- What do you think?
- About what?

23:34.225 --> 23:36.425
About that speech.

23:36.525 --> 23:38.225
Adds spice to the race.

23:38.325 --> 23:41.125
"Spice"? They've killed Nero.

23:41.225 --> 23:43.024
That would have got more points for me.

23:43.025 --> 23:44.925
Don't you understand?

23:45.025 --> 23:48.624
They've declared war on the race
and on you. Aren't you worried?

23:48.724 --> 23:52.024
The only thing that worries me
is "Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo.

23:52.124 --> 23:54.523
Is winning all you care about?

23:54.524 --> 23:57.924
Yes. It's the only standard of excellence left.

24:02.124 --> 24:05.224
- Come on. Here they come.
- It's not finished.

24:05.324 --> 24:07.324
Come on!

24:10.424 --> 24:12.924
Look at that stupid hole right in the middle.

24:13.024 --> 24:15.523
They won't get through there.

24:19.623 --> 24:20.923
Blitzkrieg!

24:21.023 --> 24:25.023
<i>As the drivers converge from their routes
and head for the first pit stop in St. Louis.</i>

24:25.123 --> 24:28.122
<i>Machine Gun Joe is still leading the field.</i>

24:28.123 --> 24:31.322
<i>With Frankenstein second. Calamity Jane third.</i>

24:31.323 --> 24:33.523
<i>Leaving Matilda the Hun in fourth position</i>

24:33.623 --> 24:36.922
<i>and Calamity Jane facing another calamity!</i>

24:36.923 --> 24:41.122
<i>Right now. Frankenstein's score points
put him just ahead of Joe...</i>

24:41.222 --> 24:46.222
Hey! Get off the rope. Jesus Chrysler, get off the rope!

24:48.322 --> 24:51.522
Hey, dummy, come on over and hold the ladder.

24:59.522 --> 25:01.721
This aggravates me.

25:01.722 --> 25:04.421
Where's the one that says "Welcome Joe Viterbo"?

25:04.422 --> 25:09.121
Score the son of a bitch, Joe.
You need every point you can get.

25:12.521 --> 25:14.721
I only mashed him slightly.

25:14.821 --> 25:17.621
- Put him out of his misery, Joe.
- Is that fair?

25:17.721 --> 25:20.121
- Yeah!
- Hey. Should I let him go?

25:22.021 --> 25:24.221
Fair's always right.

26:12.619 --> 26:14.218
One thing before we begin.

26:14.219 --> 26:18.419
The government would like it if nobody
said anything about Nero. Understand?

26:18.519 --> 26:21.619
He hit a tree, and that's it. Got it?

26:21.719 --> 26:24.219
- We don't wanna depress anybody by...
- Hey, hey.

26:24.319 --> 26:27.818
Everybody knows he was blown up
by the resistance, you schmuck.

26:27.918 --> 26:29.417
It was on television.

26:29.418 --> 26:34.317
If you wanna drive again next year, Mr.
Viterbo, keep those opinions to yourself.

26:34.318 --> 26:35.518
OK. Go ahead.

26:35.618 --> 26:37.918
This is Grace Pander from St Louis,

26:38.018 --> 26:41.518
where Matilda - a dear friend of mine -

26:41.618 --> 26:44.718
is receiving a well-deserved rub down.

26:44.818 --> 26:46.517
Tell me, Tilly, darling,

26:46.518 --> 26:49.818
what can we expect from you
when the cars go back on the road?

26:49.918 --> 26:52.118
You can expect a victory...

26:52.218 --> 26:54.417
by a member of the master race.

26:54.517 --> 26:56.017
<i>A woman.</i>

26:56.117 --> 26:59.117
Tilly, darling, that certainly is
showing a lot of confidence

26:59.217 --> 27:01.917
for someone who's lying fourth out of four.

27:02.017 --> 27:04.417
She doesn't mind, as long as she's lying somewhere.

27:04.517 --> 27:07.317
When I'm through with you,
you're gonna be lying in state.

27:07.417 --> 27:10.217
If anybody is going to boot hill,
it's you and your Bizz Bang.

27:10.317 --> 27:11.716
- Buzz Bomb.
- Shut up.

27:11.717 --> 27:14.417
You just leave my navigator alone.

27:14.517 --> 27:18.217
Girls, girls, girls. Remember you're on TV-land.

27:18.317 --> 27:20.716
Pete, how do you like being a navigator?

27:20.816 --> 27:26.815
Well, Junior, I'd like it more
if I was in the driver's seat.

27:26.816 --> 27:28.916
You'll get what's coming to you on the road.

27:29.016 --> 27:30.016
Oh, yeah?

27:30.116 --> 27:34.315
What's coming to me is the final
solution to the cowgirl problem.

27:34.316 --> 27:37.116
Frankenstein, when are you gonna make your move?

27:37.216 --> 27:39.716
Are you gonna take off-road chances for scores,

27:39.816 --> 27:43.916
or are you driving all-out to be first into New L.A.?

27:44.016 --> 27:46.414
It's not about winning, it's how you play the game.

27:46.415 --> 27:49.115
Frankenstein - a dear friend of mine.

27:49.215 --> 27:54.214
Frankenstein, tell me how it feels when,
at that electric instant, at 200 mph,

27:54.215 --> 27:58.015
life and death coexist at the moment of scoring.

27:58.115 --> 28:01.914
If you stand in the middle of Route 66
tomorrow morning at eight o'clock,

28:01.915 --> 28:04.415
you can answer that question for yourself.

28:17.714 --> 28:21.114
What are you doing? Get away from me. Joe will go nuts!

28:21.214 --> 28:26.214
Just tell him I was whispering
sweet nothings in your ear.

28:32.414 --> 28:35.014
Well, Myra, what did Frankenstein have to say to you?

28:35.114 --> 28:37.214
H- h-h-he didn't say anything. He...

28:37.314 --> 28:38.713
- What'd he say?
- Nothing...

28:38.714 --> 28:40.612
- What'd he say?!
- Nothing!

28:40.613 --> 28:43.413
I'm not playing games, Myra. I wanna know what he said.

28:43.513 --> 28:48.113
He said there was nothing sweet in my ear.

28:48.213 --> 28:49.813
"In my ear."

29:01.513 --> 29:04.413
What do you want?

29:04.513 --> 29:07.112
My name is Laurie, Mr. Frankenstein.

29:07.212 --> 29:10.612
I'm head of Chapter Seven,
St Louis Lovers of Frankenstein.

29:10.712 --> 29:15.612
- I was chosen from over 100 girls...
- To offer me your body? Is that it?

29:15.712 --> 29:18.912
You want me because I drive
the Monster and wear this costume.

29:19.012 --> 29:23.211
No, Mr. Frankenstein.
That wouldn't be fair to your navigator.

29:23.212 --> 29:26.211
It's taken her years of hard work to earn that privilege.

29:26.212 --> 29:29.512
Besides, we understand your feelings.

29:30.312 --> 29:34.011
What do you know of my feelings?

29:34.111 --> 29:36.611
Everything. Like...

29:36.711 --> 29:39.811
Like why you're afraid of falling in love.

29:39.911 --> 29:43.111
And why winning the race means everything to you.

29:43.211 --> 29:45.411
How do you know these things?

29:45.511 --> 29:48.111
From my dreams, partly.

29:48.211 --> 29:50.911
And from letters I get from other fans.

29:51.011 --> 29:54.111
Plus the club subscribes to an astrology service.

29:54.211 --> 29:57.711
Well, if you're not here to offer me
your body, what do you want?

29:57.811 --> 30:02.709
I wanted to meet you, Mr. Frankenstein.
I wanted you to know who I am.

30:02.710 --> 30:05.610
So it would have meaning.

30:05.710 --> 30:07.710
I don't understand.

30:07.810 --> 30:09.209
So what would have meaning?

30:09.210 --> 30:13.710
We love you, Mr. Frankenstein. I know
just saying it doesn't mean much.

30:13.810 --> 30:16.810
Why do you love me? Because I kill people?

30:16.910 --> 30:21.509
Scoring isn't killing, Mr. Frankenstein.
It's part of the race.

30:21.510 --> 30:26.909
You're a national hero, and we want you
to know we're with you 100%.

30:27.809 --> 30:30.209
Good night, Mr. Frankenstein.

30:42.609 --> 30:44.809
I didn't hear you come in.

30:44.909 --> 30:48.708
Who were you expecting? Machine Gun Joe?

30:48.709 --> 30:52.208
I thought I could trust you.

30:52.308 --> 30:57.108
You really just don't wanna give me a chance, do you?

30:57.208 --> 31:00.108
I was trying to help you.

31:00.208 --> 31:03.607
I'm... sorry.

31:03.608 --> 31:05.608
You're what?

31:07.808 --> 31:09.808
Sorry.

31:11.208 --> 31:14.607
He wanted to know our route, so I told him to go down 54

31:14.608 --> 31:17.508
through the Cimarron Valley.

31:18.607 --> 31:23.407
54 is a dead end. Leads nowhere.

31:23.507 --> 31:28.807
That's right. And if Joe takes it, he's sunk.

31:28.907 --> 31:32.906
The only way Joe will take that road
is if he sees us do it first.

31:32.907 --> 31:35.007
Or if he's ahead of us.

31:36.807 --> 31:40.907
- Is that the arm that came off in '98?
- Mm-hm.

31:41.007 --> 31:43.107
And...

31:43.207 --> 31:48.106
which one of those obviously perfect legs
was it that came off in '99?

31:48.706 --> 31:49.805
The right.

31:49.806 --> 31:54.406
And the left one was just broken in
six places and burned down to the bone.

31:54.506 --> 31:56.906
- Is that right?
- Mm-hm.

31:57.906 --> 32:00.706
It's a miracle you can still walk.

32:03.006 --> 32:06.406
Do you like to dance?

33:00.404 --> 33:04.702
Those Swiss mechanics sure did a good job on you.

33:04.703 --> 33:09.702
What else did they replace?

33:09.703 --> 33:11.802
Wait a minute...

33:11.803 --> 33:14.203
and I'll show you.

33:22.103 --> 33:27.003
O Mr. President, bless thy children and make them strong.

33:27.103 --> 33:31.902
Bless thy daughters Matilda and Jane, and thy son Joe.

33:32.002 --> 33:36.801
And bless thy beloved son, the immortal Frankenstein,

33:36.802 --> 33:40.302
who has given so much pleasure to so many.

33:40.402 --> 33:44.402
The hell with Frankenstein. What about Joe Viterbo?

33:53.302 --> 33:55.501
<i>The flag is down and they're away,</i>

33:55.502 --> 33:58.201
with Machine Gun Joe blasting into the lead

33:58.301 --> 34:02.801
on this second lap of the great
Transcontinental Road Race.

34:02.901 --> 34:06.201
Frankenstein is making a left turn,
splitting early from the pack.

34:06.301 --> 34:08.601
Look out, all you folks just south of here.

34:08.701 --> 34:11.600
Gee, Joe, there's nobody even close behind us.

34:11.601 --> 34:12.500
Shh.

34:12.501 --> 34:14.501
Where's he going? What's he doing?

34:14.601 --> 34:18.101
- Hey, where are we going?
- I dropped my glove.

34:19.501 --> 34:23.001
Let not the ruin of thy robes destruct the tires...

34:23.900 --> 34:25.900
Jesus Chrysler!

34:26.900 --> 34:29.600
Ladies and gentlemen, by a bizarre accident

34:29.700 --> 34:32.699
Frankenstein has killed our cherished colleague

34:32.700 --> 34:34.500
the deacon of the Bipartisan Party.

34:34.600 --> 34:37.299
I think you did that on purpose.

34:37.300 --> 34:40.500
Have to give the fans something to talk about.

34:40.600 --> 34:43.100
It's my obligation as a national hero.

34:43.200 --> 34:47.200
Frankenstein's score is now...
Does that score count, Harold?

34:47.300 --> 34:52.698
An interesting point, Junior, and one
that may set a significant precedent.

34:52.699 --> 34:55.498
Can a racer score a race official?

34:55.499 --> 34:58.598
Ooh, and after all those nice things he said about him.

34:58.599 --> 35:03.699
It don't matter. It don't count.
You can't score religious personalities.

35:03.799 --> 35:09.898
The word "deacon" has been handed
down to us from the ancient... the, uh...

35:09.899 --> 35:13.599
Frankenstein's score has been approved for 50 points.

35:13.699 --> 35:18.498
The confirmation has just been handed
to me. You know what that means, Junior?

35:18.598 --> 35:23.198
That means that the race officials from
coast to coast will be falling like flies.

35:23.298 --> 35:27.298
- Frankenstein! Agh! I hate him. I hate him.
- Oh, sh...

35:28.398 --> 35:30.198
You're salivating.

36:13.796 --> 36:16.696
Oh, my... Why did she do that?

36:17.896 --> 36:19.896
To show me she loves me.

36:25.596 --> 36:28.196
Here they come. Let's get set.

36:40.395 --> 36:42.895
Chicken game.

36:42.995 --> 36:46.495
- Chicken in a basket.
- Chicken in a casket.

36:55.195 --> 36:56.995
Oh, shit!

37:08.294 --> 37:10.694
Yeah, hey. Who got the last laugh now, huh?

37:18.294 --> 37:21.194
- The turnoff, it's coming up.
- Should I take it?

37:21.294 --> 37:23.893
- Who gives a goddamn shit?
- Should I?

37:23.894 --> 37:27.094
She says I should, so I should, right?
Or should I? I don't know.

37:27.194 --> 37:30.393
I don't think you should.
I think it's definitely a trick.

37:30.493 --> 37:33.893
I'll do it. I won't do it. I'd be a schmuck to do it.

37:36.293 --> 37:38.893
I did it and I'm no schmuck!

37:38.993 --> 37:42.293
- That's your story.
- That's right. That's right.

37:42.393 --> 37:46.293
And I see you mess with Frankenstein
again, I'm really gonna bust your eye.

37:46.393 --> 37:48.293
What do you mean, "really"?

37:57.092 --> 38:01.992
I have an almost unlimited score
possibility, but it's pretty far down the road.

38:02.692 --> 38:05.092
District penitents' compound.

38:05.192 --> 38:09.192
All those old congressmen chained up.
They'd be like sitting ducks.

38:09.292 --> 38:13.192
Yeah, and all I gotta do is drive through
a cyclone fence. Uh-uh.

38:13.292 --> 38:17.192
Look, the farther west we go,
the fewer targets there'll be.

38:17.292 --> 38:18.692
Hey, come on.

38:18.792 --> 38:22.192
Joe's already on his way to a dead end,
and the other two...

38:25.291 --> 38:27.291
OK.

38:29.291 --> 38:31.991
Take the next right.

38:32.491 --> 38:36.591
Now, as soon as the car gets within range,
I shall give the signal.

38:36.691 --> 38:41.090
We'll have just under a minute after
they reach the turnoff. Lieutenant Fury...

38:41.091 --> 38:44.991
Lieutenant Fury has nothing whatever to do with this.

38:45.091 --> 38:47.691
I want none of his surprises here.

38:47.791 --> 38:51.089
I could stand for a surprise.
Like if your Frankenstein didn't show up.

38:51.090 --> 38:53.590
Don't worry. He'll show.

38:56.790 --> 38:59.590
What's our estimated time of arrival in Albuquerque?

38:59.690 --> 39:03.589
Well, I'm not sure. I mean,
this detour is gonna make a difference.

39:03.590 --> 39:05.690
Haven't you calculated our time of arrival?

39:05.790 --> 39:08.390
I did, but I couldn't take into consideration...

39:08.490 --> 39:12.290
- Take what into consideration?
- Frankenstein! Stop the car!

39:12.390 --> 39:14.490
Hold on.

39:16.989 --> 39:20.589
- What the hell?
- Don't stop now. What are you doing?

39:20.689 --> 39:22.789
What are they doing?

39:26.489 --> 39:28.789
Sorry, brother.

39:39.389 --> 39:43.188
If that's the best the resistance can do,
we got nothing to worry about.

39:43.288 --> 39:44.588
I guess not.

39:44.688 --> 39:46.388
One thing I can't figure out

39:46.488 --> 39:49.988
is why would they bother
to dress that guy up to look like me?

39:50.088 --> 39:51.788
Maybe he was a fan.

39:55.488 --> 40:01.388
Who built this stinkin' road? If I ever get
my hands on him, I'll rip his heart out.

40:01.488 --> 40:04.788
I mean it! I'm sick of this race and I'm sick of you!

40:09.887 --> 40:13.587
I guess it must have been Joe that set
us up for that ambush, don't you think?

40:13.687 --> 40:16.686
Got in touch with those guys
and told them where we were going?

40:16.687 --> 40:19.187
I guess it might have been.

40:19.287 --> 40:22.687
But then how the hell did Joe know
we were gonna take a detour?

40:22.787 --> 40:25.786
Maybe it was those guys on the pit crew in St. Louis.

40:25.787 --> 40:29.086
Took your book out of the car
while you were getting massaged.

40:29.087 --> 40:31.786
I didn't leave my book in the car.

40:31.787 --> 40:33.787
- You didn't, huh?
- No.

40:35.186 --> 40:37.986
Well, then, I guess it couldn't have been them.

40:38.086 --> 40:41.285
- Who do you think it was?
- I have no idea.

40:41.286 --> 40:43.286
Why do you care? They didn't get you.

40:43.386 --> 40:48.286
<i>Us. They didn't get us. We're a team, remember?</i>

40:58.186 --> 41:02.485
Come on over to my side. You're gonna drive for a while.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.385
Why? I'm not trained as a driver.

41:04.485 --> 41:07.885
Never mind why. Just do as I tell you.

41:17.085 --> 41:19.885
I'm counting on you to make a nice big score for us.

41:19.985 --> 41:22.884
Sure.

41:22.885 --> 41:25.085
Anything special in mind?

41:25.185 --> 41:27.485
Something'll turn up.

41:27.585 --> 41:29.284
I'm sure that it will.

41:44.384 --> 41:47.284
Jesus H Christ! I'll kill that broad!

41:47.384 --> 41:50.484
- What did I do?
- Shut your face.

41:51.584 --> 41:54.083
Cornball, what's the fastest way through here?

41:54.084 --> 41:58.482
Well, um... actually, the only way
we do it is we get a bulldozer

41:58.483 --> 42:00.983
and we trim this edge down here and we drive through.

42:01.083 --> 42:03.583
No, what's the best way between here and Albuquerque?

42:03.683 --> 42:06.883
- You got to go back to the main highway.
- I'll lose 45 minutes!

42:06.983 --> 42:10.683
I've seen you before. I'm one of
your greatest fans, you know that?

42:10.783 --> 42:15.383
I follow all of the races. I got pictures of you
all over the outhouse.

42:15.483 --> 42:18.682
I named my favorite dog after you,
Mr. Frankenstein. I did.

42:18.683 --> 42:22.782
Lousy stinkin' dirt ball. You got two seconds to live.

43:03.181 --> 43:06.181
Come on, Pete, honey. You gonna take all day with that?

43:06.281 --> 43:09.880
I wanna get on the road, make a few
more scores. My blood lust is fading.

43:09.881 --> 43:13.981
Almost finished, Calamity, sweetheart.
We'll be back on the road in no time,

43:14.081 --> 43:16.379
then we'll cream that Nazi's ass for her.

43:16.380 --> 43:17.780
What'd you say? I...

43:17.880 --> 43:19.380
Blitzkrieg!

43:21.480 --> 43:24.480
You lousy bitch! I'll kill you for that!

43:24.580 --> 43:28.180
Nobody scores my navigator and gets away with it.

43:45.279 --> 43:46.279
Uh-oh.

43:46.379 --> 43:49.279
Here she comes. And boy, is she pissed.

43:49.379 --> 43:52.479
What does she expect?
You leave your navigator lying around,

43:52.579 --> 43:55.779
naturally somebody's gonna run over him.

44:37.577 --> 44:40.577
She's gaining on us, momma,
and she's got murder on her mind.

44:40.677 --> 44:44.177
<i>Schnell. Meine kleine Buzz Bomb.</i>

45:13.376 --> 45:16.976
- That's good.
- All right, on three. One, two, three.

45:18.776 --> 45:21.276
Support it. Easy. Steady as she goes.

45:33.975 --> 45:35.475
Here they come!

45:40.375 --> 45:43.275
A detour. I really needed that right now.

46:12.774 --> 46:14.474
Holy shit.

46:14.574 --> 46:18.774
A special bulletin.
There's been an accident. An explosion.

46:18.874 --> 46:23.273
It looks like Matilda has been blown totally...

46:26.273 --> 46:32.173
<i>Correction. Matilda has made
an impressive score. Stand by.</i>

46:36.373 --> 46:41.373
Don't you wanna take over now? I'm afraid
I'm making us lose an awful lot of time.

46:41.473 --> 46:44.673
You're doing just fine.

46:54.072 --> 46:57.572
- Looks like an easy score.
- Yeah. Yeah, it does.

46:57.672 --> 46:59.672
It's always best to start small.

47:08.972 --> 47:12.372
- I missed him.
- It takes some practice.

47:12.472 --> 47:16.771
- Before it comes easy?
- It never comes easy.

47:16.871 --> 47:19.471
Keep your eyes on the road.

47:21.171 --> 47:25.171
How far is it to the penitents' compound?

47:25.271 --> 47:27.971
Oh, maybe 20 miles.

47:30.171 --> 47:32.571
Stop the car.

47:40.670 --> 47:42.370
Get out.

47:42.470 --> 47:44.470
Out.

47:50.770 --> 47:52.569
Come to the other side.

47:52.570 --> 47:54.770
Around the front.

48:07.469 --> 48:10.369
Where is the penitents' compound?

48:12.169 --> 48:14.369
It's in Japan.

48:18.169 --> 48:19.569
Get in.

48:28.969 --> 48:33.768
I could just push you out of this car
and pick up a quick 30 points.

48:33.868 --> 48:36.367
Who are you? Who are you working for?

48:36.368 --> 48:39.168
I'm Thomasina Paine's granddaughter.

48:40.568 --> 48:42.868
I'm honored.

48:44.068 --> 48:48.068
So you were gonna capture me and
replace me with that goon back there.

48:48.168 --> 48:50.567
What for?

48:50.568 --> 48:54.668
He was going to deliver our ultimatum to Mr. President.

48:54.768 --> 48:58.668
Your life in exchange
for the permanent abolition of the race.

49:28.666 --> 49:32.866
<i>She was a great. Dear friend of mine.</i>

49:32.966 --> 49:38.166
<i>And I shall remember her forever.
Howling down that freeway in the sky.</i>

49:38.266 --> 49:41.566
<i>Knocking over the angels.</i>

49:42.666 --> 49:48.666
<i>The valiant Hun's demise was in fact
caused by enemies of the people.</i>

49:48.766 --> 49:54.264
<i>There will be a special broadcast
by Mr. President at 1900 hours.</i>

49:54.265 --> 50:00.865
<i>Stay tuned to find out how you can help
Mr. President preserve our way of life...</i>

50:00.965 --> 50:03.465
Calamity, turn off the television.

50:03.565 --> 50:06.565
Hey, you guys wanna stop playing that song, please?

50:06.665 --> 50:11.764
Look, this is a race, a sporting event, not
a daredevil stunt. I want some protection.

50:11.765 --> 50:14.565
You should have given us an escort after Nero got it.

50:14.665 --> 50:17.065
Joe would score the escort, wouldn't you, baby?

50:17.165 --> 50:21.363
You wanna zip your lip, Myra? Huh?
Now, are you going to cover me or not?

50:21.364 --> 50:25.564
Look, Mr. Viterbo, if you're afraid to
go on with the race, why don't you quit?

50:25.664 --> 50:27.164
You're calling me a turkey?

50:27.264 --> 50:30.263
If you ask me, you're all
making excuses for poor driving.

50:30.264 --> 50:34.663
Poor driving?! Listen, honey.
Matilda the Hun was a champion driver.

50:34.664 --> 50:37.763
Nobody could've scored my navigator
and gotten away with it.

50:37.764 --> 50:39.763
And he's talking about poor driving!

50:39.764 --> 50:43.864
I'd like to see you do it. I've been driving
for ten years. Nobody talks to me like this.

50:43.964 --> 50:46.363
- This stinks.
- It's all on account of the rebels.

50:46.463 --> 50:51.262
Who mentioned anything about rebels?
There are no rebels. Understand?

50:51.263 --> 50:54.263
Then who was that old lady on the television?

50:54.363 --> 50:56.463
Thomasina Paine. She's a harmless lunatic.

50:56.563 --> 51:01.563
Would you please come outside, sir?
We like to ask you a few questions.

51:03.363 --> 51:06.163
- Come on, Annie.
- Alone, if you don't mind.

51:06.263 --> 51:10.863
<i>Mr. President will explain those
accidents during his address to the nation.</i>

51:10.963 --> 51:13.762
- How did she jam the networks?
- And bump off our friends?

51:13.862 --> 51:17.762
She didn't bump off anybody. She walked
into a television station waving a gun,

51:17.862 --> 51:21.962
forced them to put her on the air. We've
taken her back to the asylum. That's it.

51:22.062 --> 51:24.662
- I got just two words to say about that.
- Oh?

51:24.762 --> 51:26.261
Bull shit!

51:26.262 --> 51:28.062
Excuse me.

51:28.962 --> 51:31.662
Hey! I told you to stop playing that song!

51:32.462 --> 51:37.262
You forget, Joe, that I'm a representative
of Mr. President's government.

51:37.362 --> 51:40.261
I happen to hold the power of life and death.

51:40.361 --> 51:43.561
Yeah? Well, I happen to hold the clam sauce.

51:44.361 --> 51:48.960
Look out, Viterbo. You may be
the second biggest clown in this circus,

51:48.961 --> 51:51.761
but if I want you dead, you're dead.

51:51.861 --> 51:54.561
- Second biggest?
- Sit down and eat!

51:59.961 --> 52:02.161
I told you to stop playing that music!

52:02.961 --> 52:06.659
Were they armed, or did they expect
the fire to be enough to stop you?

52:06.660 --> 52:11.960
I don't know what they expected. We
just ran through it all and kept going.

52:12.060 --> 52:14.060
One more question, Mr. Frankenstein.

52:15.860 --> 52:18.659
Did you take that particular road on your own initiative,

52:18.660 --> 52:21.360
or on the advice of your navigator?

52:23.460 --> 52:25.260
On my own initiative.

52:25.360 --> 52:28.760
Thank you, Mr. Frankenstein. That will be all.

52:30.360 --> 52:35.058
<i>There has been a lot of talk about American rebels.</i>

52:35.059 --> 52:37.059
<i>We have positive proof</i>

52:37.159 --> 52:40.458
<i>that it was none other than the treacherous French</i>

52:40.459 --> 52:44.059
<i>who have been sabotaging our great race.</i>

52:44.159 --> 52:48.358
<i>Just as they and their stinking European allies</i>

52:48.359 --> 52:53.659
<i>have undermined and destroyed our great national economy.</i>

52:53.759 --> 52:56.158
<i>It is no coincidence. My dear children.</i>

52:56.159 --> 53:00.458
<i>That the word "sabotage" was invented by the French.</i>

53:00.558 --> 53:03.057
- Where's Annie?
- I don't know.

53:03.058 --> 53:04.658
Hey, did you hear the news?

53:04.758 --> 53:09.158
Mr. President said it was the French
who knocked off Nero and Matilda.

53:09.258 --> 53:11.857
Watch out for the crêpe suzettes.

53:11.858 --> 53:15.458
<i>"Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo and Frankenstein.</i>

53:15.558 --> 53:21.058
<i>As they begin the last lap
of their long and difficult journey</i>

53:21.158 --> 53:24.158
<i>toward New Los Angeles.</i>

53:28.257 --> 53:31.157
Drop your keys?

53:31.257 --> 53:33.957
I was just looking for something I lost.

53:34.057 --> 53:35.357
The race?

53:35.457 --> 53:37.657
Look, Joe...

53:37.757 --> 53:40.657
I threw you off course, OK?

53:40.757 --> 53:42.857
All's fair in love and war.

53:42.957 --> 53:46.857
I'm glad to hear you say that, Annie,
because what we got goin' here

53:46.957 --> 53:49.056
definitely ain't love.

53:49.057 --> 53:52.056
Well, then, why don't we just forget about it?

53:52.756 --> 53:56.555
You know, Annie, it's too bad things
ain't like they were in the old days,

53:56.556 --> 54:02.056
when we'd just take somebody in an alley
and blow their brains out. You know?

54:02.156 --> 54:04.756
- Joe, please.
- Go ahead and scream, Annie.

54:04.856 --> 54:08.756
- You're hurting me, Joe.
- There's nobody to hear you.

54:08.856 --> 54:10.856
Huh?

54:13.956 --> 54:18.554
How does it feel to know you're gonna
spend the rest of your life in pain?

54:18.555 --> 54:22.755
The rest of your life is about a minute and a half.

54:24.255 --> 54:29.255
Frankie. Glad you came. I caught your
navigator Screwin' around with the car,

54:29.355 --> 54:33.355
so I thought I'd come down
and have a look at what was going on.

54:33.455 --> 54:35.055
Hey, come on, Frank...

55:56.752 --> 55:58.652
Upstairs.

55:58.752 --> 56:01.752
So much for a fair fight.

56:01.852 --> 56:06.051
<i>Next chance I get, you're dead.</i>

56:12.651 --> 56:18.051
What were you doing? Getting more secret
instructions from the lunatic fringe?

56:22.551 --> 56:25.351
Why don't you just turn me in and get it over with?

56:25.451 --> 56:28.851
No need to.

56:28.951 --> 56:32.149
You've blown your cover. You're no threat to me.

56:32.150 --> 56:35.849
Anyway, you're not someone I would throw away.

56:35.850 --> 56:39.750
- I have a job to do.
- Your job is a waste of time.

56:39.850 --> 56:42.050
The world doesn't wanna be saved.

56:42.150 --> 56:45.949
I'm giving you a chance to save one small part of it.

56:45.950 --> 56:48.149
Yourself.

56:48.150 --> 56:51.449
Who are you anyway?

56:51.450 --> 56:53.850
Nobody.

56:53.950 --> 56:56.849
I was brought up in a government
training centre to be what I am -

56:56.949 --> 57:01.849
Frankenstein, the best driver on earth. This year.

57:01.949 --> 57:05.349
They use one up, they bring in another.

57:05.449 --> 57:09.949
- But I will be the last of the line.
- Oh, who's kidding who?

57:12.949 --> 57:15.149
I never kid.

57:39.948 --> 57:42.447
Why don't you ever take off that glove?

57:42.448 --> 57:44.748
What's underneath it?

57:44.848 --> 57:47.848
It's my secret.

57:47.948 --> 57:50.847
You and the Swiss doctors again?

57:50.947 --> 57:53.947
There are no Swiss doctors.

57:54.047 --> 57:59.447
Just native... American... know-how.

58:20.046 --> 58:22.045
- Have you checked the oil?
- Yes.

58:22.046 --> 58:24.746
- Have you checked the hydraulics?
- An hour ago.

58:24.846 --> 58:28.345
- Brakes? Tires? Water?
- Yeah, they're OK. Everything's OK.

58:28.346 --> 58:33.246
Don't worry. I'm not going to
do anything to sabotage the car.

58:35.446 --> 58:36.845
You get a load of that face?

58:36.846 --> 58:39.746
I wonder if somebody got points for that eye.

58:41.246 --> 58:45.845
Listen, Frankenstein, there's just you,
me and Joe left in the race, and...

58:45.945 --> 58:49.845
Well, I just want you to know that
whoever wins and whatever happens,

58:49.945 --> 58:53.544
it's been really grand racin' with you folks.

58:53.545 --> 58:56.444
I also wanna say
that I think you make a real nice couple.

58:56.445 --> 58:59.445
- Thank you, Jane.
- Good luck.

59:06.845 --> 59:09.243
Joe, Myra,

59:09.244 --> 59:11.944
I just wanna say, whatever happens, whoever wins...

59:12.044 --> 59:14.444
Hey, save it for the French.

59:16.844 --> 59:21.344
The cars have started, lined up,
and are ready to roll on the last lap.

59:21.444 --> 59:24.243
They're off! Frankenstein... Holy Chrysler!

59:24.244 --> 59:26.944
Joe has just scored his own pit crew!

59:27.044 --> 59:31.544
You lousy sons of bitches! That'll teach you!

59:32.044 --> 59:35.943
"Machine Gun" Joe Viterbo, that funny man from Chicago,

59:36.043 --> 59:39.643
has scored his own mechanics for 40 points,

59:39.743 --> 59:43.743
and is off to catch Calamity Jane and Frankenstein.

59:52.243 --> 59:55.343
Screw you, Joe Viterbo, and your mother!

59:55.443 --> 59:59.343
We'll see who gets to New L.A. first,
with the highest score too.

59:59.443 --> 1:00:01.842
It's coming up on the left.

1:00:01.843 --> 1:00:05.141
Forget it. I'm keeping Frankie in my sights.

1:00:05.142 --> 1:00:08.342
He's got five minutes on us, and he's stretching it.

1:00:08.442 --> 1:00:11.742
So what? If there's trouble up ahead,
he'll find it first.

1:00:11.842 --> 1:00:17.142
<i>Oh, yeah. Take a look at your face. You'll find it first.</i>

1:00:18.242 --> 1:00:21.142
You know, Myra, some people might think you're cute.

1:00:21.242 --> 1:00:25.042
But me, I think you're one very large baked potato.

1:00:25.142 --> 1:00:28.541
Roaring down Motorway 66 towards California,

1:00:28.641 --> 1:00:31.640
Frankenstein looks certain to be first across the line.

1:00:31.641 --> 1:00:36.040
But Machine Gun Joe is still way ahead on points,

1:00:36.041 --> 1:00:40.341
and he could win the race even by
arriving second in New Los Angeles.

1:00:40.441 --> 1:00:43.541
What's your prediction, Grace?

1:00:43.641 --> 1:00:49.241
You know, Junior, when Machine Gun Joe
was just a little boy in Chicago,

1:00:49.341 --> 1:00:54.041
he had a pet snake that he used to love
to ride over with his tricycle.

1:02:45.836 --> 1:02:50.936
- Break out the thermos of hi-pro drink.
- Coming right up.

1:03:14.835 --> 1:03:19.035
- Here. I didn't mean to hog it all.
- Thanks. What flavor is it?

1:03:19.135 --> 1:03:22.435
- Vanilla.
- Hm. Not my favorite.

1:03:26.935 --> 1:03:29.934
This isn't vanilla. It's peach or something.

1:03:29.935 --> 1:03:34.135
Yeah, well, my taste buds
got wiped out in the crash of '97.

1:03:34.234 --> 1:03:39.034
It's a good thing mine that are still intact.
At least the French can't poison us.

1:03:43.034 --> 1:03:45.334
What's Frankenstein's location now?

1:03:45.434 --> 1:03:50.234
He's about 50 miles out, Lieutenant, and coming fast.

1:03:53.434 --> 1:03:57.533
Goodbye, Mrs. Paine. When you see me
again, Frankenstein will be my prisoner

1:03:57.534 --> 1:04:00.234
and the country will know we must be taken seriously.

1:04:00.334 --> 1:04:04.332
- Fury, wait. I'm coming with you.
- No, Mrs. Paine, it's too dangerous.

1:04:04.333 --> 1:04:07.133
Nonsense. I've waited 20 years for this moment.

1:04:07.233 --> 1:04:09.133
I know I can't join you on the mission,

1:04:09.233 --> 1:04:12.833
but I want to see you pull it off with my own eyes.

1:04:14.433 --> 1:04:18.833
Couple of turnoffs coming up.
What's the quickest way to New L.A.?

1:04:18.933 --> 1:04:23.233
- That's funny.
- What?

1:04:23.333 --> 1:04:26.732
I can't... I can't seem to focus my eyes on the map.

1:04:26.733 --> 1:04:31.232
I think we stay on 7... I feel like I'm gonna pass out.

1:04:32.232 --> 1:04:34.432
Look at that.

1:04:37.132 --> 1:04:40.832
- It's them, isn't it?
- Please... please, stop the car.

1:04:40.932 --> 1:04:43.832
Sorry. We're in a race.

1:04:53.032 --> 1:04:57.431
Frankenstein, stop right now. We wanna talk to you.

1:04:58.331 --> 1:05:01.931
<i>Stop before I force you to.</i>

1:05:13.731 --> 1:05:16.631
I'll bomb you to a halt if I have to.

1:05:28.930 --> 1:05:32.530
Annie, help me. Turn off the engine.

1:05:33.930 --> 1:05:38.130
Annie's dead, Mrs. Paine. He must have killed her.

1:05:39.330 --> 1:05:41.830
Now I'm really going to let him have it.

1:05:51.229 --> 1:05:54.729
Look at that. The rebels
are sure giving it to Frankenstein.

1:05:54.829 --> 1:05:59.329
Thank you, rebels. Mary, I think we got this race won.

1:05:59.429 --> 1:06:02.129
- Aren't we gonna help him?
- Are you nuts or something?

1:06:02.229 --> 1:06:07.929
I'm getting my ass out of here before they
make an emergency landing. Sit down.

1:06:08.029 --> 1:06:10.029
Attagirl.

1:08:02.124 --> 1:08:04.224
Well, America, there you have it.

1:08:04.324 --> 1:08:08.124
Frankenstein has just been attacked
by the French air force,

1:08:08.224 --> 1:08:10.624
<i>and he's whipped their derrières.</i>

1:08:10.724 --> 1:08:14.323
His point total for this one'll be
something astronomical.

1:08:14.324 --> 1:08:16.824
Machine Gun Joe better watch out.

1:08:23.224 --> 1:08:26.223
- Right on schedule.
- Hey, what happened?

1:08:26.323 --> 1:08:28.523
I slipped you a 30-minute sleepex.

1:08:28.623 --> 1:08:31.523
Didn't want you doing something we would both regret.

1:08:31.623 --> 1:08:32.822
Did they attack us?

1:08:32.823 --> 1:08:36.223
According to the radio, we were
attacked by the French air force.

1:08:36.323 --> 1:08:38.523
Was the plane shot down?

1:08:38.623 --> 1:08:41.823
Even those Swiss doctors couldn't have helped them.

1:08:41.923 --> 1:08:46.923
I'm sorry. I know they were your people.
But I can't let anything stop me now.

1:08:47.023 --> 1:08:49.423
They didn't expect you to give up easily.

1:08:49.523 --> 1:08:52.822
They were prepared for whatever happened.

1:08:52.922 --> 1:08:54.622
Oh, my God, you've been hit!

1:08:54.722 --> 1:08:57.122
I'll make it.

1:08:58.122 --> 1:09:01.822
I'm sorry things worked out this way.

1:09:01.922 --> 1:09:05.422
- It's not over yet.
- I'm afraid it is.

1:09:05.522 --> 1:09:06.322
Hey!

1:09:37.021 --> 1:09:39.021
What the hell do you think you're doing?

1:09:39.121 --> 1:09:41.620
It doesn't make any difference what happens to me.

1:09:41.621 --> 1:09:45.321
That is the dumbest, sorriest thing
I've ever heard you say.

1:09:45.421 --> 1:09:49.720
I don't believe you've got a drop of
Thomasina Paine's blood in your body.

1:09:49.820 --> 1:09:53.620
The minute things get rough, you close
your eyes and try to drive us off a cliff.

1:09:53.720 --> 1:09:57.920
If you'd just stop trying to kill me
for a minute, I need your help.

1:09:58.020 --> 1:10:01.120
How can you possibly expect me to help you?

1:10:01.220 --> 1:10:02.820
You're my navigator.

1:10:02.920 --> 1:10:05.519
You're the only one who knows where you're going.

1:10:05.520 --> 1:10:08.320
I mean, whose side are you on anyway?

1:10:08.420 --> 1:10:11.620
I thought the only thing you cared about
was winning the race.

1:10:11.720 --> 1:10:16.819
Sure. Only the winner of the race
gets to shake hands with Mr. President.

1:10:17.419 --> 1:10:19.919
- Is that a grenade?
- A hand grenade.

1:10:20.019 --> 1:10:26.019
That handshake is all I've lived for
for as long as I can remember.

1:10:26.119 --> 1:10:29.719
No, wait a minute. I don't want you to die.

1:10:33.219 --> 1:10:34.819
It's my life's work.

1:11:15.817 --> 1:11:18.417
<i>Why do you wanna win this race so bad?</i>

1:11:18.517 --> 1:11:22.017
Why do I wanna win this race? In the name of hate.

1:11:22.117 --> 1:11:24.117
One big victory for hate.

1:13:04.713 --> 1:13:07.713
Give me your hand. Give me your hand!

1:13:23.312 --> 1:13:27.112
- Hey, stop. Will you stop the car?
- Shut up! What is that?

1:13:27.212 --> 1:13:32.712
It's a hand. Will you stop the goddamn car? Stop the car!

1:13:43.812 --> 1:13:47.410
You're going to have to shift the gears for me now.

1:13:47.411 --> 1:13:49.910
The only thing that worries me

1:13:49.911 --> 1:13:53.511
is how am I going to shake hands with Mr. President?

1:13:53.611 --> 1:13:56.711
Mr. President's the one who should be worried now.

1:14:16.510 --> 1:14:21.710
He's coming! Can you hear that engine?
Still in perfect tune.

1:14:21.810 --> 1:14:26.110
Here he is - the one and only three-time winner

1:14:26.210 --> 1:14:30.810
and sole survivor of the 20th
annual Transcontinental Road Race,

1:14:30.910 --> 1:14:34.610
none other than Frankenstein himself!

1:14:35.610 --> 1:14:37.309
And now Mr. President.

1:14:37.409 --> 1:14:39.909
Our enemy, the French,

1:14:40.009 --> 1:14:44.709
have destroyed nearly all our gallant racers.

1:14:44.809 --> 1:14:49.208
Just as they have crippled our once-great economy,

1:14:49.209 --> 1:14:52.209
and wrecked our telephone system.

1:14:52.309 --> 1:14:56.109
But even they, in all their evil power,

1:14:56.209 --> 1:14:59.609
were not able to destroy Frankenstein,

1:14:59.709 --> 1:15:03.609
who is the embodiment of our national virtue

1:15:03.708 --> 1:15:07.108
and therefore indestructible.

1:15:07.208 --> 1:15:12.708
It is fitting that Frankenstein should be
the one chosen by your president

1:15:12.808 --> 1:15:17.308
to lead you in this war against
the French which I now decree.

1:15:20.408 --> 1:15:23.908
Frankenstein has been shot!
There is a French spy in our midst!

1:15:24.008 --> 1:15:26.907
<i>Guards, seize that woman!</i>

1:15:26.908 --> 1:15:30.008
Frankenstein, are you all right?

1:15:41.707 --> 1:15:42.907
Annie!

1:15:46.307 --> 1:15:48.107
Frankenstein...

1:16:13.306 --> 1:16:18.405
<i>Frankenstein! Frankenstein!
Frankenstein! Frankenstein! Frankenstein!</i>

1:16:18.406 --> 1:16:22.006
Frankenstein! Frankenstein! Frankenstein! Frankenstein!

1:16:31.005 --> 1:16:36.204
Mr. And Mrs. President Frankenstein -
dear friends of mine -

1:16:36.205 --> 1:16:39.005
can you tell us what your first official acts will be?

1:16:39.105 --> 1:16:43.105
I plan to pension off the secret police,
restore free elections,

1:16:43.205 --> 1:16:47.405
end minority privilege, and move the seat
of government back to New Los Angeles.

1:16:47.505 --> 1:16:49.505
We've been governed from abroad long enough.

1:16:49.605 --> 1:16:55.404
Mr. President, is it true that you are now
accepting rebels into your government?

1:16:55.504 --> 1:16:59.404
Well, since I have accepted one into my house...

1:16:59.504 --> 1:17:03.604
President Frankenstein has appointed
my great-grandmother, Thomasina Paine,

1:17:03.704 --> 1:17:08.203
in view of her experience in the field,
as the minister for domestic security.

1:17:08.204 --> 1:17:12.204
And I plan to deal very harshly with rebels.

1:17:12.304 --> 1:17:18.203
Anybody who is unhappy with happiness
can go find someplace else to live.

1:17:18.303 --> 1:17:20.902
- What about the race?
- The race is abolished.

1:17:20.903 --> 1:17:22.903
- Abolished?
- That's right.

1:17:23.003 --> 1:17:27.403
We feel that the country no longer needs
this gratuitous display of violence

1:17:27.503 --> 1:17:30.103
to show the world that its virility is still intact.

1:17:30.203 --> 1:17:36.103
Mr. President, isn't it true that as a racer
your popularity depended on violence?

1:17:36.203 --> 1:17:41.203
I'm afraid I shall have to let
my press secretary answer that question.

1:17:41.303 --> 1:17:44.602
Stop annoying Mr. President
with impertinent questions, Junior.

1:17:44.702 --> 1:17:46.802
It's the race, man.

1:17:46.902 --> 1:17:49.802
President Frankenstein, you can't call off the race.

1:17:49.902 --> 1:17:52.002
The American people won't stand for it!

1:17:52.102 --> 1:17:54.202
Get out of the way, Junior.

1:17:54.302 --> 1:17:58.902
The race is the symbol of everything
we hold dear - our American way of life.

1:17:59.002 --> 1:18:01.702
Sure, it's violent. But that's the way we love it.

1:18:01.802 --> 1:18:05.302
<i>Violent, violent, violent. And that's why we love you!</i>

1:18:05.402 --> 1:18:07.802
Frank, do we have to listen to this?

1:18:07.902 --> 1:18:09.102
No.

1:18:18.401 --> 1:18:21.200
<i>As to this matter of violence.</i>

1:18:21.201 --> 1:18:26.001
<i>The technique of violence
was first developed in 2.000.000 BC</i>

1:18:26.101 --> 1:18:28.201
<i>by the Australopithecines.</i>

1:18:28.301 --> 1:18:32.701
<i>A tribe of four-foot primates
who had no brains to speak of.</i>

1:18:32.801 --> 1:18:38.100
<i>But who. Nevertheless. Invented the
tomahawk and used it on each other.</i>

1:18:38.200 --> 1:18:43.800
<i>This practice led to the enlargement
of the brain - another useful weapon.</i>

1:18:43.900 --> 1:18:49.099
<i>Yes. Murder was invented even before man began to think.</i>

1:18:49.100 --> 1:18:55.100
<i>Now. Of course. Man has become
known as the thinking animal.</i>
