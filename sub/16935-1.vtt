AT HIDE AND SEEK, MRS. DUNNE.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.851
( panting )

00:50.851 --> 00:52.620
OKAY.

00:52.620 --> 00:55.856

man trapped in a well.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.179

01:18.179 --> 01:19.780
CAPTAIN ROB!

CAPTAIN ROB, CAN YOU HEAR ME?
GRAB THE ROPE!

01:24.952 --> 01:26.420
CAN YOU HELP HIM?

01:26.420 --> 01:29.223
HARRY, NO. THIS IS--
THIS IS NOT A REAL WELL.

01:29.223 --> 01:33.761
WE CAN'T KEEP COMING OUT HERE
TRYING TO GET YOUR IMAGINARY
FRIEND OUT OF TROUBLE.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.897
WELL, THANKS FOR SAVING HIM.
COMING, CAPTAIN ROB!

01:36.897 --> 01:39.333
WE DIDN'T REALLY
SAVE ANYBODY.

01:39.333 --> 01:43.571
- I'M SORRY, DAVE.
- IT'S OKAY, HE JUST HAS
AN OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION.

01:43.571 --> 01:46.774
DON'T WORRY,
HE'LL GROW OUT OF IT.
THEY ALL DO.

01:46.774 --> 01:50.378
CAPTAIN ROB, COME ON OUT,
I GIVE UP!

01:50.378 --> 01:53.181
WHERE IS HE?
WHERE ARE YOU, CAPTAIN ROB?

01:53.181 --> 01:56.184
HONEY, HE'S GONE.

01:56.184 --> 01:59.253
HE MUST'VE KNOWN
YOU WERE STARTING
SCHOOL TODAY.

01:59.253 --> 02:01.622
MOM, DO I HAVE
TO GO TO REGULAR SCHOOL?

02:01.622 --> 02:03.891
- YES, HONEY.

02:03.891 --> 02:07.127
THANK YOU, SWEETIE.
I THINK IT'S TIME YOU
MADE SOME NEW FRIENDS.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.729
YOU KNOW, FRIENDS
YOUR OWN AGE.

02:08.729 --> 02:11.199
- I'M JUST NOT READY.
- OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

02:11.199 --> 02:13.367
CAPTAIN ROB
LEFT THIS FOR YOU.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.506
HE SAID TO COUNT YOUR STEPS
VERY CAREFULLY.

02:18.506 --> 02:20.541
WOW, A TREASURE MAP!

02:20.541 --> 02:22.576

THE SWIMMING POOL.

06:41.435 --> 06:43.136
SOMEBODY CHIPPED
MY TOOTH.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.673
HOW DO YOU THINK
I FEEL?

06:45.673 --> 06:47.808
SOMEONE BIT ME
IN THE FOREHEAD.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.444
OH, NO!

06:50.444 --> 06:52.245
YOU COULD'VE SAVED THAT

06:52.245 --> 06:54.915
THAT'S STUPID.
I HAPPEN TO KNOW MY MOM

07:04.492 --> 07:06.193
WHY DOES THAT NOT
SOUND FAMILIAR?

07:06.193 --> 07:10.063

WE'VE NEVER MET BEFORE?

07:44.832 --> 07:47.501
IT'S RIGHT OVER THERE.

07:47.501 --> 07:50.070
- IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?
- NOPE, IT'S A TREASURE MAP.

07:50.070 --> 07:51.505
COOL.

07:51.505 --> 07:53.674
MY MOM SAYS IT'S
SOMEWHERE IN THE SCHOOL.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.743
I DON'T KNOW, I'M PRETTY
FAMILIAR WITH THE SCHOOL

07:55.743 --> 07:58.411
AND I'VE NEVER SEEN
THAT X BEFORE. MM-MMM.

07:58.411 --> 08:00.413
OOH, BUT I DO
KNOW SOMETHING.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.315

I'M IT?

08:06.319 --> 08:07.921
WHAT'S IT?

08:07.921 --> 08:10.223
I DON'T REALLY KNOW,
YOU KNOW, BUT WHATEVER
IT IS,

08:10.223 --> 08:13.060
IT'S SOMETHING YOU
DON'T WANT TO BE,
AND RIGHT NOW...

08:13.060 --> 08:14.828
YEAH, YOU ARE.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.697
WAIT, SO IF I TOUCH YOU,
YOU'RE IT?

SO HIGH SCHOOL'S ALL
ABOUT LOOKING COOL, HARRY,
SO STICK WITH ME.

08:27.641 --> 08:30.310
Harry:
WHY ARE THOSE GIRLS
DRESSED IN MATCHING OUTFITS?

08:30.310 --> 08:32.679
THEY'RE CHEERLEADERS, HARRY.
IT'S A DANGEROUS CULT.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.616
- DON'T LET THEM TALK TO YOU.
- DON'T WE WANT THEM
TO TALK TO US?

08:35.616 --> 08:37.384
NO. NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO.

08:37.384 --> 08:39.419
- WHY NOT?
- BESIDES COOTIES AND OTHER
MEDICAL REASONS,

08:39.419 --> 08:42.590
THEY'RE NOT IN THE COOL CROWD,
WHICH I AM, WHICH YOU WANT
TO BE A PART OF.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.992
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
- NO. HEY.

08:47.460 --> 08:50.063
- WHAT ABOUT HER?
- ( scoffs ) SHE'S
A TOTAL DORK.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.299
I MEAN, JUST LOOK
HOW SHE DRESSES.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.401
CHECK OUT THAT SKIRT.
I MEAN, IT'S SO SHORT.
WHERE'S THE FLOOD?

08:54.401 --> 08:56.837
( laughs )
AND THAT SWEATER--
IT'S SO TIGHT,

08:56.837 --> 08:58.538
HER MILK-BUBBLES
ARE POPPING OUT.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.341
- LOSER.
- OH MY GOSH, SHE'S NOT
WEARING UNDERWEAR.

09:01.341 --> 09:04.011
YEAH, HOW DORKY IS THAT.
I'M WEARING TWO PAIR RIGHT NOW.

09:04.011 --> 09:07.080
- ME TOO.
- ( laughs )

09:07.080 --> 09:08.682
THIS IS
MY MOHAWK FRIEND,
TURK.

09:08.682 --> 09:10.718
HE'S PART OF THE COOL CROWD.
HEY, KIMOSABE!

09:10.718 --> 09:12.519
SHUT UP, ASS-FACE.

09:12.519 --> 09:15.088
THAT'S THE IROQUOIS
NAME HE GAVE ME FOR HAVING
THE STRONG FACE OF AN ASS.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.591
LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GOING
TO GO HAVE A POW-WOW!

09:18.525 --> 09:20.293
OOH. HI.

09:20.293 --> 09:24.197
( gulps )
I HOPE THE CARPET
MATCHES THE DRAPES.

09:24.197 --> 09:25.498
EXCUSE ME?

09:25.498 --> 09:27.334
YOU KNOW,
IN THE LIBRARY.

09:28.368 --> 09:30.570
OH. YEAH.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.272
I DON'T THINK IT DOES.

09:32.272 --> 09:35.208
- YOU'RE NEW HERE, RIGHT?
- DEPENDS ON HOW YOU DEFINE NEW.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.210
YOU'RE THE KID
WHO WAS HOME SCHOOLED.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.046
YEAH.
HOW'D YOU KNOW?

09:39.046 --> 09:41.481
I WAS ASSIGNED TO WRITE
AN ARTICLE FOR THE SCHOOL PAPER.

09:41.481 --> 09:42.883
IT WAS EITHER
A FEATURE ON YOU

09:42.883 --> 09:44.752
OR THE NEW FOUR-COLOR INK PENS
AT THE STUDENT STORE.

09:44.752 --> 09:46.987
FOUR COLORS IN ONE PEN?

09:46.987 --> 09:49.990
NO! THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.324
YEAH, WELL,

09:51.324 --> 09:53.894
I'D RATHER BE
WRITING A HARD-HITTING
INVESTIGATIVE PIECE

09:53.894 --> 09:56.664
BUT NOTHING EVER
HAPPENS AROUND HERE.
I'M JESSICA MATTHEWS.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.832
HI.

09:59.667 --> 10:02.169
- HARRY DUNNE.
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

10:03.570 --> 10:05.072
HEY, FREAKSHOW,

10:05.072 --> 10:07.407
DID JESSICA GIVE YOU
THAT BANANA IN YOUR PANTS?

10:07.407 --> 10:08.809
NO, MY MOM DID.

10:08.809 --> 10:10.343
- GROSS.
- YOU WANT A BITE?

10:10.343 --> 10:12.846
Lloyd:
HEY, SMELLS LIKE CHEESE.
WHOO!

10:12.846 --> 10:15.749
- TURK, LEAVE HIM ALONE.
- "TURK, LEAVE HIM ALONE."

10:15.749 --> 10:17.284
- SHUT UP!
- "SHUT UP!"

10:17.284 --> 10:20.220
- Lloyd: OH BOY.
- HARRY, I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.090
PRETTY COLORS.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.858
RIDE'S NOT
OVER YET, PAL.

10:24.858 --> 10:27.060
HEY, CAN MY FRIEND
HARRY COME TOO?

10:27.060 --> 10:28.829
- YES, HE CAN.
- HI, HARRY.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.898
SO WERE YOU HELD BACK
TWO YEARS LIKE LLOYD?

10:30.898 --> 10:32.666
NO, I WAS
HELD BACK THREE.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.168
Lloyd: BY YOUR MOM?

10:35.168 --> 10:38.238
* ALL YOU GOT
TO FEEL IT, ALL RIGHT. *

10:40.173 --> 10:41.975
Woman:
AND PRINCIPAL COLLINS,

10:41.975 --> 10:43.844
YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO KNOW
THAT THIS YEAR

10:43.844 --> 10:45.913
WEDNESDAY'S ARE
"SOUTH OF THE BORDER" DAYS.

10:45.913 --> 10:49.082
WE'LL BE SERVING
A SPICY TUNA TAMALE

10:49.082 --> 10:51.785
ALONG WITH A THREE-CHEESE
QUESADILLA.

10:51.785 --> 10:54.755
SOUNDS LIKE IT'S GOING
TO BE ANOTHER...

10:54.755 --> 10:56.724
HOT YEAR IN THE KITCHEN.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.501
- HELLO?
- Collins: YES?
WHAT IS IT?

11:08.501 --> 11:11.739
SIR, IT'S TIME
FOR MORNING ANNOUNCEMENTS.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.473
YES, I--
I'M AWARE OF THAT.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.208
YES. UM...

11:15.208 --> 11:17.677
WHY DON'T YOU
MAKE THE ANNOUNCEMENTS
THIS MORNING, DEAR?

11:17.677 --> 11:21.081
- BUT WHAT SHOULD I ANNOUNCE?
- Woman: TELL HER ABOUT
THE QUESADILLAS.

11:21.081 --> 11:23.884
- MAKE SOMETHING UP!
- OKAY.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.557
WELL, THAT WAS
A MOOD BREAKER.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.092
YOU KNOW, HONEY...

11:32.092 --> 11:34.862
I THINK I'VE FINALLY
FIGURED OUT A WAY

11:34.862 --> 11:36.930
TO BILK THIS SCHOOL
OUT OF ENOUGH MONEY

11:36.930 --> 11:39.800
TO GET US THAT CONDO
IN WAIKIKI.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.235
HOW, SWEET BABY?
YOU'VE DONE IT ALL.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.937
SMALL POTATOES.

11:43.937 --> 11:46.373
THIS IS THE BIG ONE.
THIS IS VISIONARY.

11:46.373 --> 11:48.742
THIS IDEA IS GENIUS.

11:48.742 --> 11:50.911
- ( giggles )
- LOOK AT THIS.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.784
THE RICHARD MOFFITT
SPECIAL NEEDS GRANT.

11:56.784 --> 11:59.820
- MM-HMM.
- THIS MOFFITT GUY USED TO BE
IN A SPECIAL NEEDS PROGRAM,

11:59.820 --> 12:02.689
AND THEN HE LEARNS
TO STRING A COUPLE
OF SENTENCES TOGETHER

12:02.689 --> 12:04.191
AND NOW HE'S SOME
BIG HOTSHOT.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.994
ANYWAY, THE STATE IS GIVING
100 GRAND IN HIS NAME

12:06.994 --> 12:11.431
TO EVERY SCHOOL THAT HAS
A SPECIAL NEEDS CLASS.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.935
- THIS IS FANTASTIC!
- MM-HMM.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.938
ALL WE HAVE TO DO
IS KILL THIS MOFFITT GUY

12:17.938 --> 12:19.606
AND WE GET ALL THE MONEY.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.708
NO, NO.

12:21.708 --> 12:26.613
WHAT WE NEED IS TO SET UP
A FAKE SPECIAL NEEDS CLASS.

12:26.613 --> 12:29.049
WE START OUR OWN CLASS.

12:29.049 --> 12:32.820
PROBLEM IS,
WHERE DO WE FIND KIDS...

12:34.254 --> 12:37.357
WE CAN PASS OFF
AS SPECIAL?

12:38.291 --> 12:40.060
Lloyd:
OKAY, THAT'S HIGH ENOUGH!

12:40.060 --> 12:42.429
- THANKS, TURK.
- I'M FLYING! WOO-HOO!

12:42.429 --> 12:45.765
Harry:
SO THIS IS WHAT A FLAG
SEES ALL DAY.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.135
- YEAH.
- AND YOUR FRIEND TURK
IS TOTALLY GREAT.

12:48.135 --> 12:49.837
YEAH, HE'S ACES, HUH?

12:49.837 --> 12:52.840
HEY, THANKS, TURK!
WE'RE SO HIGH!

12:52.840 --> 12:54.174
( laughing )

12:54.174 --> 12:56.309
BINGO.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.847
WELCOME TO SPECIAL NEEDS
ORIENTATION.

12:59.847 --> 13:02.715
I'M MS. HELLER,
THE LUNCH LADY.

13:02.715 --> 13:04.617
AND IT--
DAMN.

13:04.617 --> 13:07.220
I MEAN,
YOUR NEW TEACHER.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.422
YEAH.

13:09.422 --> 13:14.127
NOW THE REASON YOU TWO
ARE HERE BEFORE CLASS
OFFICIALLY STARTS

13:14.127 --> 13:16.897
IS BECAUSE YOU'RE...

13:16.897 --> 13:18.498
EXTRA SPECIAL.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.101
THANK YOU.

13:21.101 --> 13:24.404
AND WERE PERSONALLY SELECTED
BY PRINCIPAL COLLINS.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.273
WHO'S PRINCIPAL COLLINS?

13:26.273 --> 13:28.675
- HE'S THE PRINCIPAL.
- WOW.

13:28.675 --> 13:30.277
YOUR FIRST ASSIGNMENT

13:30.277 --> 13:32.679
IS TO PICK
THE REST OF THE CLASS.

13:32.679 --> 13:35.148
HEY!

13:35.148 --> 13:38.585
FIND STUDENTS THAT ARE
JUST AS SPECIAL AS YOU TWO.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.053
SPECIAL.

13:41.354 --> 13:42.522
WHAT?

13:43.556 --> 13:46.226
IS-- IS THIS GONNA BE
ON THE MIDTERM?

13:48.228 --> 13:50.463
NO.

13:51.731 --> 13:53.266
( eraser squeaking )

13:56.803 --> 13:59.706
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE
THE FIRST PERSON I EVER
BROUGHT HERE, HARRY.

13:59.706 --> 14:02.675
- IS THIS YOUR SPECIAL PLACE?
- NO, I JUST USUALLY EAT
IN THE CRAPPER.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.912
YEAH, SAVES TIME.
OUT WITH THE OLD,
IN WITH THE NEW.

14:04.912 --> 14:07.847
- COULD WE EAT THERE TOMORROW?
- YEAH, BUT FIRST WE NEED
TO FIND KIDS

14:07.847 --> 14:11.184
THAT ARE SPECIAL, NEEDY,
AND CLASSY ENOUGH TO BE IN
OUR SPECIAL NEEDS CLASS.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.620
IT'LL BE LIKE TAKING
CANDY FROM A STRANGER.

14:13.620 --> 14:16.789
- Lloyd: "HAR-ERY"?
- THE SECOND "R" IS SILENT.

14:16.789 --> 14:18.325
OH, THAT MAKES
MUCH MORE SENSE.

14:18.325 --> 14:21.494
OH, LITTLE CRIPPLED BOY.
LOOK.

14:21.494 --> 14:23.897
OUR FIRST RECRUIT.

14:23.897 --> 14:28.235
- HIS CURSE IS OUR BLESSING.
- CAREFUL, HARRY, DON'T
SCARE HIM.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.337
HEY, LITTLE GUY.
HEY LITTLE ORPHAN BUDDY.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.605
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- SKATEBOARD.

14:32.605 --> 14:36.009
- ONE DAY,
THEY'LL FIND A CURE.
- YOU BRAVE LITTLE SOLDIER.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.744
WHAT?

14:37.744 --> 14:39.612
NO, MAN, IT'S NOTHING.
THE CAST COMES OFF
IN A FEW WEEKS.

14:39.612 --> 14:43.216
HE'S OBVIOUSLY IN DENIAL.
MAYBE WE CAN HELP.

14:43.216 --> 14:46.086
WE'RE PART OF A SPECIAL CLASS
TAUGHT BY THE LUNCH LADY.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.521
I MEAN, MS. HELLER.
YOU SHOULD JOIN UP.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.257
IT DOESN'T
REQUIRE ANY WALKING.

14:50.257 --> 14:52.492
NO ONE WILL MAKE FUN
OF YOUR HORRIBLE DEFORMITY.

14:53.760 --> 14:56.029
- HOW MUCH HOMEWORK IS THERE?
- THAT'S THE DOWNSIDE.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.764
- THERE'S NONE.
- DUDE, DUDE.

14:58.698 --> 15:01.134
WAIT A MINUTE, I CAN SPEND
THE WHOLE YEAR

15:01.134 --> 15:02.970
IN A CLASS TAUGHT
BY THE LUNCH LADY?

15:02.970 --> 15:05.172
- YEAH.
- ( laughs )

15:05.172 --> 15:09.376
- CAN I BRING MY GIRLFRIEND?
- YOU CAN BRING WHATEVER YOU
WANT, MY LITTLE FRIEND.

15:09.376 --> 15:11.544
ALL RIGHT.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.882
* YEAH *

15:15.882 --> 15:17.917
* HERE WE GO *

15:27.927 --> 15:30.530
* IT'S A NEW DAY,
BUT IT ALL FEELS OLD *

15:30.530 --> 15:33.633
- ( screams )
- * IT'S A GOOD LIFE
THAT'S WHAT I'M TOLD *

15:33.633 --> 15:38.805
* BUT EVERYDAY,
IT ALL JUST FEELS THE SAME *

15:38.805 --> 15:41.541
* AT MY HIGH SCHOOL,
IT FELT MORE TO ME *

15:41.541 --> 15:44.377
* LIKE A JAIL CELL,
A PENITENTIARY... *

15:44.377 --> 15:47.280
- HARRY DUNNE, SPECIAL NEEDS.
- Lloyd: HE'S WITH US.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.449
Security:
YOU DESERVE HIM.

15:49.449 --> 15:52.685
- I GUESS I OWE YOU THIS ONE.
- * I DON'T EVER WANT TO BE
LIKE YOU *

15:52.685 --> 15:55.022
* I DON'T WANT TO DO
THE THINGS YOU DO *

15:55.022 --> 15:57.824
* I'M NEVER GONNA HEAR
THE WORDS YOU SAY *

15:57.824 --> 16:00.327
* AND I DON'T EVER WANNA,
I DON'T EVER WANNA *

16:00.327 --> 16:02.595
* BE YOU *

16:02.595 --> 16:04.998
* DON'T WANNA
BE JUST LIKE YOU... *

16:04.998 --> 16:06.666
GO, GO, GO!

16:06.666 --> 16:08.835
* THIS IS THE ANTHEM,
THROW ALL YOUR HANDS UP *

16:08.835 --> 16:10.803
- * YOU... *
- ( whistle blows )

16:10.803 --> 16:13.206
HE'S OUT.
PUT HIM ON THE DISABLED LIST.

16:15.542 --> 16:17.710
Harry:
THAT MEANS YOU'RE
ONE OF US NOW.

16:22.082 --> 16:24.384
* YOU... *

16:27.320 --> 16:29.122
WE ALREADY HAVE
A SPECIAL SLOGAN.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.458
HARRY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:31.458 --> 16:33.126
SHE'S A FOREIGN
EXCHANGE STUDENT.

16:33.126 --> 16:34.894
SHE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T
SPEAK THE ENGLISH.

16:34.894 --> 16:37.864
CHING CHONG CHING
CHINGY CHONG CHING
CHONG CHING.

16:37.864 --> 16:40.367

* Y'ALL GOT TO FEEL ME,

16:49.242 --> 16:52.145
Girl on PA:
Get your car washed
and support the Stallions.

16:52.145 --> 16:54.914
- AAH.
- WHOA!

16:54.914 --> 16:56.283
THE HALF BOY/HALF HORSE.

16:56.283 --> 16:58.751
OH! THAT'S MORE
OF WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

16:58.751 --> 17:02.422
- Harry: HE'S SUPER SPECIAL.
- WELL...

17:02.422 --> 17:05.258
I MEAN, I GOT TO GET
A JOB ANYWAY.

17:05.258 --> 17:07.694
SO IF I--
IF I SIGN YOUR THING,

17:07.694 --> 17:10.063
I CAN JUST COME AND GO
WHENEVER I WANT TO?

17:10.063 --> 17:12.199
YOU WERE BORN FREE,

17:12.199 --> 17:14.067
AND FREE
YOU SHALL REMAIN.

17:14.067 --> 17:16.636
WELL, OKAY.

17:17.936 --> 17:19.239
AH!

17:19.239 --> 17:20.272
EASY, EASY.

17:20.272 --> 17:21.574
EASY, BOY,
EASY, BOY.

17:21.574 --> 17:25.078
EASY, BOY.
IT'S OKAY.
YOU'RE IN!

17:25.078 --> 17:28.047
( "A-Team" theme playing )

17:29.149 --> 17:31.384
- WE DID IT!
- YES, WE DID, HARRY.

17:31.384 --> 17:33.086
SPECIAL NEEDS CLASS,
1986.

17:33.086 --> 17:37.324
WE ARE THE CHOSEN ONES,
ALL PRESENT AND ACCOUNTED FOR.

17:38.925 --> 17:41.628
- ( thuds )
- Harry: ...FOOTBALL PLAYER,
THE CRIPPLED KID...

17:41.628 --> 17:43.596
Lloyd:
WHAT ABOUT LEWIS,
THE HALF HORSE BOY?

17:43.596 --> 17:46.633
- Harry: HE REALLY
HAD ME FOOLED.
- HERE WE GO.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.235
HEY, THANKS
FOR THE GRUB, MRS. D.

17:48.235 --> 17:51.538
- YOU'RE WELCOME, LLOYD.
- HEY, WHERE'S MR. D?

17:51.538 --> 17:54.974
OH, HE PASSED AWAY
A FEW YEARS AGO.

17:54.974 --> 17:57.477
HE MISSED
ONE GREAT POT OF STEW.
( laughs )

17:57.477 --> 18:00.947
ACTUALLY, IT'S MEATLOAF,
BUT YOU JUST PUT EVERYTHING
IN YOUR SOUP.

18:00.947 --> 18:02.649
I LIKE IT A LOT.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.290
IS IT OKAY
IF HE SPENDS THE NIGHT?

18:10.290 --> 18:13.593
- LLOYD, HAVE YOU
ASKED YOUR PARENTS?
- I LEFT MY DAD A NOTE.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.396
Dad's voice:
"POP, I'M SLEEPING
AT HARRY'S TONIGHT.

18:16.396 --> 18:21.168
LOVE, LLOYD.
P.S., YOU'RE OUT OF KETCHUP."

18:21.168 --> 18:24.671
GOOD KID,
BUT YOU COULD'VE JUST CALLED.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.909
GOT ANY CRAZY EIGHTS?

18:29.909 --> 18:32.212
GO FISH.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.013
NOTHING.

18:34.013 --> 18:36.216
FOUR.

18:38.050 --> 18:40.620
HA! NOW YOU HAVE
TO MOVE YOUR PEG
SEVEN SPACES

18:40.620 --> 18:42.289
AND PUT YOUR SHIRT
ON BACKWARDS.

18:42.289 --> 18:44.591
WOW, YOU REALLY SUCK
AT THIS GAME.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.959
YEAH, WELL, I ALMOST ALWAYS
BEAT CAPTAIN ROB.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.662
- WHO'S CAPTAIN ROB?
- JUST A GUY I HANG OUT WITH.

18:49.662 --> 18:51.931
I KNOW THE TYPE.
LIVES IN THE BASEMENT,
SMELLS LIKE A SPONGE.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.401
NO, CAPTAIN ROB'S
SEVEN FEET TALL,
WEARS AN EYE-PATCH,

18:54.401 --> 18:56.369
- GOT A HOOK FOR A HAND.
- WOW, SOUNDS LIKE A PIRATE.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.872
WHAT? NO. HE'S GOT
A PARROT ON HIS SHOULDER,
BURIES TREASURE.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.175
- YEAH, THAT'S A PIRATE.
- I DON'T THINK SO.

19:02.175 --> 19:06.413
THIS GUY DRINKS RUM FROM
A BARREL, SAYS, "YO, HO, HO,"
HAS A PEG LEG.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.948
- A PEG LEG?
- YEAH, GO-CART ACCIDENT.

19:08.948 --> 19:13.220
HERE... WE... GO!

19:13.220 --> 19:15.488
BE CAREFUL, CAPTAIN ROB.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.595
- OOH.
- THREE, TWO, ONE.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.164
AAH, YOU LANDED ON CANDY LAND.
NOW YOU HAVE TO SWALLOW IT.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.234
READY?

19:27.234 --> 19:29.436
SWALLOW!

19:30.537 --> 19:32.372

THAT'S GOOD TOP HAT.

19:32.372 --> 19:34.474
- ( laughs )
- HEY, FELLAS,

19:34.474 --> 19:36.509
IT'S GETTING KIND OF LATE.
COME ON.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.645
- CAN I BE ON TOP?
- ONLY IF I CAN BE ON BOTTOM.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.214
- ALL RIGHT!
- YEAH!

19:41.214 --> 19:45.785
AIRPLANE
INTO THE HANGAR.
ZZZ-- OW!

19:45.785 --> 19:47.687

- GOOD NIGHT, LLOYD.

19:53.926 --> 19:56.263
THANKS FOR BEING
A FRIEND TO MY HARRY.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.231
ALL RIGHT, BOYS,
SLEEP TIGHT.

19:58.231 --> 19:59.666
DON'T LET
THE BEDBUGS BITE.

19:59.666 --> 20:02.569
- * HEY, HEY... *
- OHH. HUH!

20:08.475 --> 20:10.343
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- WHAT?

20:10.343 --> 20:13.280
YOUR MOM JUST TOTALLY
MADE A MOVE ON ME.

20:13.280 --> 20:15.682
- SHE DID NOT.
- YEAH, SHE DID, HARRY.

20:15.682 --> 20:18.818
MAYBE SOON
I'LL BE YOUR NEW DADDY.

20:18.818 --> 20:21.621
- LLOYD, SHE'S MY MOM.
- LISTEN, I CAN'T HELP MY HEART.

20:21.621 --> 20:25.157
THAT'S RIGHT, WHEN I'M
YOUR NEW DAD, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DO WHAT I SAY.

20:25.157 --> 20:28.060
- WILL NOT.
- DON'T YOU TAKE THAT TONE
WITH ME, YOUNG MAN.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.096
- SHUT UP.
- I WILL STOP THIS CAR
RIGHT NOW.

20:30.096 --> 20:32.532
- YOU'RE NOT MY REAL DAD.
- YOU TAKE THAT BACK!

20:32.532 --> 20:34.834
- BE QUIET, BUTTLICK!
- OHH!

20:34.834 --> 20:38.170
- WHERE DID YOU LEARN THAT WORD?
- I LEARNED IT FROM...

20:38.170 --> 20:40.172
LISTENING TO YOU!

20:40.172 --> 20:42.442
- I HATE YOU!
- KIDS.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.381
FOR OUR
SPECIALLY NEEDY CLASS!

20:48.381 --> 20:49.882
- THEY'RE PERFECT.
- MM-HMM.

20:49.882 --> 20:52.852
WELL, YOU SHOULD ALL
BE VERY PROUD OF YOURSELVES.

20:52.852 --> 20:56.088
YOU ARE THE PIONEERS HERE
AT PROVIDENCE HILL HIGH,

20:56.088 --> 20:58.325
THE VERY FIRST
SPECIAL NEEDS CLASS.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.293
AND TO COMMEMORATE
THIS OCCASION,

21:00.293 --> 21:02.462
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE
A CLASS PHOTO.

21:02.462 --> 21:04.464
SO LET'S COVER THIS UP
JUST FOR THE PICTURE.

21:04.464 --> 21:07.867
HOLD THIS VERY HIGH.
THAT'S IT.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.437
AND LET'S ALL FORM A GROUP
UNDER THE SIGN. QUICKLY.

21:10.437 --> 21:12.204
NOW, NOW,
NOW, NOW, NOW.

21:12.204 --> 21:14.206
BEAUTIFUL.
BIG SMILE.

21:14.206 --> 21:15.842
HERE WE GO.

21:25.585 --> 21:27.153
DO YOU REMEMBER WHY
WE'RE HERE?

21:27.153 --> 21:30.657
I'M SUPPOSED
TO TAKE A PICTURE FOR
SUPERINTENDENT ZIMMER?

21:30.657 --> 21:31.991
AND?

21:31.991 --> 21:35.027
- YOU WANT ME TO TAKE IT?
- YES, YES!

21:35.027 --> 21:36.663
- OH.
- OKAY.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.331
OKAY, HERE WE GO.
READY?

21:38.331 --> 21:39.866
CHEESE!

21:39.866 --> 21:42.001
- CHEESE.
- All: CHEESE!

21:43.336 --> 21:45.872
- WHAT STINKS?
- THAT'D BE ME, SIR.

21:45.872 --> 21:49.342
- WIFE MADE THE STEW LAST NIGHT.
- SHUT UP, LLOYD.

21:49.342 --> 21:51.043
- YOU'RE NOT MARRIED YET.
- WILL BE.

21:51.043 --> 21:53.179
I HOPE YOU'LL ALL ENJOY
YOUR NEW CLASSROOM.

21:53.179 --> 21:55.515
THIS IS NOT IT.
IT'S A SPECIAL WING
IN BACK OF THE SCHOOL

21:55.515 --> 21:58.551
WE'VE BUILT FOR YOU.
WHY DON'T YOU GO BACK
AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT NOW?

21:58.551 --> 22:00.987
QUICKLY, NOW.
JUST HEAD BACK THERE.
THAT'S IT, NOW.

22:00.987 --> 22:04.156
PRINCIPAL COLLINS,
WHAT ABOUT THE CRIPPLED BOY?

22:04.156 --> 22:06.793
- YES, TAKE HIM WITH YOU.
- "CONFIRMITIVE."

22:06.793 --> 22:09.662
EASY.
LLOYD, LLOYD, LLOYD.
NO, NO, NO.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.599
I CAN-- I'LL JUST WALK,
ALL RIGHT? IS THAT ALL RIGHT?

22:12.599 --> 22:18.104
- COLLINS IS A GREAT MAN.
- YEAH, THAT'S WHY HE WAS
ELECTED PRINCIPAL.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.509
- THAT'S IT.
ON YOUR WAY.
- YOUR HIGHNESS.

22:22.509 --> 22:25.778
THAT'S GOOD.
WELL, SO FAR SO GOOD.

22:25.778 --> 22:28.080
I DO THINK WE NEED
SOME MORE PICTURES, THOUGH.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.083
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE THE KIDS ON
A FIELD TRIP TOMORROW?

22:31.083 --> 22:32.952
AND...?

22:32.952 --> 22:35.988
- AND TAKE SOME
MORE PICTURES.
- OKAY.

22:35.988 --> 22:37.524
YEAH, OKAY.

22:37.524 --> 22:40.159
WELL, DON'T YOU HAVE
A PHONY CLASS TO TEACH?

22:40.159 --> 22:42.895
I PUT IN FOR A SUB.

22:42.895 --> 22:45.364
( gasps )
WAS THAT NAUGHTY?

22:46.499 --> 22:49.035
I THINK I NEED
A "PANKING."

22:49.035 --> 22:50.703
PANK, PANK, PANK.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.439
YOU GONNA GIVE ME
A PANKING?

22:52.439 --> 22:55.207
* CLAP YOUR HANDS... *

22:55.207 --> 22:57.777
Lloyd:
HELLO, CLASS.
MY NAME IS MR. CHRISTMAS.

22:57.777 --> 23:00.980
MRS. HELLER HAD TO ATTEND
SOME SERIOUS AND URGENT
BUSINESS,

23:00.980 --> 23:03.650
SO I WILL BE
YOUR SUBSTITUTE TEACHER.

23:03.650 --> 23:07.119
IT'S GONNA TAKE ME A WHILE
TO LEARN EVERYONE'S NAMES,
SO PLEASE BE PATIENT.

23:07.119 --> 23:10.122
- ME, ME. PICK ME!
- UH... YOU.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.559
- HARRY.
- HARRY. OOOH.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.061
YOU LOOK FAMILIAR.
OH, DID I HAVE YOUR BROTHER?

23:15.061 --> 23:17.864
- NO.
- NO, OKAY.
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

23:17.864 --> 23:19.832
- WAS THERE ONE...?
- YO!

23:19.832 --> 23:22.435
WHAT'S WITH HORSE BOY?
NOW HE'S A BRIGHT SHINY SUN.

23:22.435 --> 23:24.270
YEAH, DON'T LOOK
DIRECTLY AT HIM.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.706
Lewis:
I'M JUST HANDING OUT FLIERS
AT THE TANNING SALON, GUYS.

23:26.706 --> 23:29.642
- IT'S A PART-TIME JOB.
- NO, THAT'S-- CONGRATULATIONS.

23:29.642 --> 23:31.744
DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION THERE,
BRIGHT EYES?

23:31.744 --> 23:35.047
YEAH, MY QUESTION'S
WHEN THE OLD TEACHER LADY
COMING BACK?

23:35.047 --> 23:37.750
I AM YOUR TEACHER LADY
FOR TODAY.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.586
( door opens )

23:40.987 --> 23:44.791
LLOYD, CAN I HAVE
A WORD WITH YOU FOR A MINUTE?

23:44.791 --> 23:47.794
OH, TAKE THIS TIME
TO STUDY AMONGST YOURSELVES.

23:47.794 --> 23:50.229
OBVIOUSLY THERE MUST BE SOME
SORT OF FAMILY EMERGENCY,

23:50.229 --> 23:52.565
OTHERWISE THERE'S NO REASON
MY FATHER WOULD BE

23:52.565 --> 23:54.634
INTERRUPTING ME
WHILE I'M WORKING.

23:54.634 --> 23:56.469
- COMING. WHAT THE...?
- THAT'S YOUR DAD?

23:56.469 --> 23:58.070
YEAH.
WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN?

23:58.070 --> 24:01.073
- HARRY.
- HARRY.
COME WITH ME, HARRY.

24:01.073 --> 24:04.243
- WHAT'S UP, POP?
- WE NEED TO TALK.

24:04.243 --> 24:07.647
SO YOU MUST BE IN THE AIR FORCE.
I LIKE YOUR FLIGHT SUIT.

24:07.647 --> 24:11.283
- I'M A CUSTODIAN.
- WELL, THEN...

24:11.283 --> 24:13.085
AYE AYE, SIR!

24:14.086 --> 24:16.489
OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU
CRAZY BOYS DOING
IN MY TOOL SHED?

24:16.489 --> 24:18.357
WE'RE NOT CRAZY, DAD,
WE'RE SPECIAL.

24:18.357 --> 24:21.093
AND PRINCIPAL COLLINS
WANTS US TO HAVE OUR OWN
SPECIAL CLASSROOM.

24:21.093 --> 24:24.831
MY BOY'S SPECIAL,
HOW 'BOUT THAT?!

24:24.831 --> 24:28.434
I KNEW YOU
WERE DIFFERENT!
OHHH!

24:28.434 --> 24:30.469
I'M TAKING THE DAY OFF.

24:30.469 --> 24:32.805
COME ON, COME ON.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.274
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
NOW THAT TEACHER LADY'S GONE,

24:35.274 --> 24:37.209
UM... I HAVE A QUESTION.

24:37.209 --> 24:40.246
DO YOU GUYS
KNOW WHY OUR CLASS
IS IN THE TOOL SHED?

24:40.246 --> 24:42.982
WHO CARES, LEWIS?
IT'S BETTER THAN REAL SCHOOL.

24:42.982 --> 24:46.853
IF WE DON'T MESS THIS UP,
WE CAN GO A WHOLE YEAR WITHOUT
DOING ANY REAL WORK AT ALL.

24:46.853 --> 24:50.289
YEAH, MAN, WE CAN DO
ANYTHING WE WANT.

24:50.289 --> 24:52.058
ANYTHING.

24:52.058 --> 24:53.660
ANYTHING?

24:53.660 --> 24:59.065
SO IF I HAD A GIRLFRIEND
LIKE TERRI, I COULD BRING
HER HERE AND...

24:59.065 --> 25:01.300
DO STUFF WITH HER?

25:01.300 --> 25:02.735
YOU GOT IT, JERKOFF.

25:02.735 --> 25:04.704
THEN I'M IN.
YEAH.

25:04.704 --> 25:10.209
BUT I CAME HERE TO LEARN
ABOUT AMERICA.

25:10.209 --> 25:11.944
LISTEN, BABY,

25:11.944 --> 25:17.183
THERE IS NOTHING MORE AMERICAN
THAN NOT DOING ANYTHING
AND GETTING AWAY WITH IT.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.918
OHH.
THEN I'M IN.

25:18.918 --> 25:22.088
- JUST LIKE JERKOFF.
- LEWIS.

25:25.091 --> 25:26.158
CARL?

25:28.761 --> 25:31.530
- HE'S SNAPPING OUT OF IT.
- WE NEED HIM.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.499
I KNOW.
COME ON, KID!

25:33.499 --> 25:35.434
- COME ON, COME ON!
- GO GET SOME!

25:35.434 --> 25:38.104
( all yelling )

25:39.505 --> 25:42.642
- CARL?
- ( yelling )

25:42.642 --> 25:45.244
OH, WOW.

25:46.679 --> 25:48.114
WHO IS
BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
AGAIN?

25:48.114 --> 25:50.783
HE'S THE PILGRIM WHO USED
PENICILLIN TO KILL GODZILLA.

25:50.783 --> 25:52.785
RIGHT.
HOW'D YOU GET
SO SMART?

25:52.785 --> 25:54.453
PUBLIC SCHOOL.
YEAH.

25:54.453 --> 25:56.856
WHEN YOU LIVE IN THE BASEMENT,
YOU BREATHE IN A LOT
OF CHALK DUST.

25:56.856 --> 25:58.791
IT WRITES ALL THE ANSWERS
ALL OVER YOUR BRAIN.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.092
- YOU'RE SO LUCKY.
- OOH, NOW...

26:00.092 --> 26:02.695
- HOW 'BOUT A SLUSHEE?
- A. SLUSHEE.

26:02.695 --> 26:05.197
DON'T TELL ME.
ABRAHAM SLUSHEE--

26:05.197 --> 26:08.801
I KNOW THIS--
THIRD PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES!

26:08.801 --> 26:10.937
Lloyd:
THAT'S RIGHT, HARRY.

26:10.937 --> 26:14.240
AND THIS IS THE FROZEN
DELICIOUS TREAT HE WAS
NAMED AFTER.

26:16.709 --> 26:19.812
- NICE JUGS.
- YEAH.

26:19.812 --> 26:21.480
HEY, YOUR MOM'S
GOT JUGS LIKE THESE.

26:21.480 --> 26:23.950
Harry:
YEAH, BUT THEY
NEVER BEEN IN A MAGAZINE.

26:23.950 --> 26:26.252
Lloyd:
THEY OUGHT TO BE.
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL.

26:29.956 --> 26:32.091
OOH, HARRY,
I JUST REALIZED SOMETHING.

26:32.091 --> 26:34.060
- WHAT?
- YOU'RE IT!

26:34.060 --> 26:36.863
- OH NO, YOU'RE NOT
GETTING ME AGAIN.
- "VICTORIA'S SECRET," HUH?

26:36.863 --> 26:38.831
- THOSE CLOTHES
ARE FOR CHICKS.
- $2.50.

26:38.831 --> 26:40.967
- YOU'RE IT.
- OH, YOU WANNA GO?

26:40.967 --> 26:42.869
YOU WANNA GO,
HUH, HARRY?

26:42.869 --> 26:44.837
JOUSTING,
14th CENTURY!

26:46.973 --> 26:48.875
- YOU'RE IT!
- YOU'RE IT.

26:48.875 --> 26:50.409
INVISIBILITY SHIELD.
BOOO!

26:50.409 --> 26:52.011
I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE!

26:52.011 --> 26:54.947
- I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE!
- PLEASE PAY ME THE $2.50.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.382
I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE!

26:56.382 --> 26:58.317
- I KNOW WHERE YOU ARE!
- YOU'RE IT.
( laughs )

26:58.317 --> 27:00.186
Lloyd:
SERIOUSLY,
STOP FOR A SECOND.

27:00.186 --> 27:02.454
COME HERE, HARRY,
SERIOUSLY, FOR A SECOND.
YOU'RE IT!

27:02.454 --> 27:03.723
OH!
NO, YOU'RE IT!

27:03.723 --> 27:06.458
HARRY, BUNS!
YOU'RE IT!

27:06.458 --> 27:09.195
YOU'RE IT!
( laughs )

27:09.195 --> 27:11.664
- YOU'RE IT!
- NO, I'M NOT.

27:11.664 --> 27:13.666
YEAH, YOU ARE.

27:13.666 --> 27:15.201
HE TOUCHED YOU.

27:15.201 --> 27:17.136
YOU'RE IT UNTIL
YOU TOUCH SOMEONE ELSE.

27:17.136 --> 27:20.673
I KNOW THE RULES, I'M JUST NOT
PLAYING YOUR STUPID GAME.

27:20.673 --> 27:22.775
NOW PAY ME $2.50.

27:25.344 --> 27:27.613
YOU'RE IT.

27:27.613 --> 27:28.647
YOU'RE IT.

27:28.647 --> 27:29.849
- YOU'RE IT.
- NO, YOU'RE IT.

27:29.849 --> 27:31.217
- NO, YOU ARE.
- YOU'RE IT.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.786
( both repeating )
YOU'RE IT.

27:36.622 --> 27:40.893
ENOUGH!
YOU'RE IT!

27:40.893 --> 27:43.863
AND NO TOUCH-BACKS,
NO DO-OVERS,

27:43.863 --> 27:46.598
NO ERASIES,
AND IN THIS WHOLE STORE

27:46.598 --> 27:48.768
IS HOME FREE!

27:51.503 --> 27:54.506
LLOYD, CAN HE DO THAT?

27:54.506 --> 27:56.642
OH YEAH, HARRY.

27:56.642 --> 27:59.712
HE CAN...
AND HE DID.

28:01.647 --> 28:03.249
AND NOW...

28:03.249 --> 28:07.186
IT'S ON
LIKE DONKEY KONG.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.321
PAY THE MAN.

28:09.321 --> 28:10.790
PAY THE MAN.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.263
- Harry: GOOD.
- YEAH.

28:17.263 --> 28:19.131
I THOUGHT WE
HANDLED THAT
PRETTY WELL.

28:19.131 --> 28:20.800
THESE ARE
REALLY COLD, HUH?

28:20.800 --> 28:23.702
THAT'S WHY YOU GOT
TO DRINK 'EM FAST,
HARRY, TRUST ME.

28:30.576 --> 28:32.478
Lloyd:
DRINK IT, HARRY.
COME ON, BUDDY!

28:32.478 --> 28:35.281
DRINK, DRINK, DRINK!
GO, HARRY, GO!

28:35.281 --> 28:37.349
WHOO-HOO!

28:39.285 --> 28:41.053
OWW.

28:41.854 --> 28:43.189
REFRESHING.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.758
OHH! SO WHAT DO YOU
WANT TO DO TODAY,
HARRY?

28:45.758 --> 28:47.994
I DON'T KNOW.
( whimpers )

28:47.994 --> 28:49.996
OWW!
IT HURTS SO GOOD.

28:49.996 --> 28:51.563
- AHH!
- ( slurping )

28:51.563 --> 28:53.632
NO, HARRY, YOU'RE NOT
DRINKING IT FAST ENOUGH.

28:53.632 --> 28:55.802
YOU GOT TO DRINK FASTER.
YOU GOT TO GO FAST.
GO FAST!

28:55.802 --> 28:58.838
GO FAST, GO FAST, GO FAST!
YOU GOT TO DRINK IT FAST,
HARRY,

28:58.838 --> 29:00.773
BEFORE IT MELTS!
( slurping )

29:05.444 --> 29:06.979
TASTES SO GOOD.

29:06.979 --> 29:09.315
I CAN'T FEEL MY FACE.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.520
DIDN'T HURT.

29:14.520 --> 29:16.155
DIDN'T HURT.

29:16.989 --> 29:19.859
- I FELT THAT.
- ( both laughing )

29:21.727 --> 29:23.095
MMMM...

29:25.998 --> 29:29.836
HARRY,
MY MOUTH IS FROZEN.

29:29.836 --> 29:33.439
I CAN'T--
I CAN'T FEEL MY LIPS.

29:33.439 --> 29:36.876
- HARRY, THEY'RE FROZEN.
- I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.911
OH, HARRY,
HERE COMES TROUBLE.

29:41.747 --> 29:43.549
OH, HEY GUYS.

29:43.549 --> 29:46.252
YOUR MILK BUBBLES
LOOK NICE, JESSICA.

29:46.252 --> 29:48.587
- ( both chuckle )
- Lloyd: GOOD ONE, HARRY.

29:48.587 --> 29:51.090
( weak laugh )
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS TOMORROW.

29:59.798 --> 30:01.800
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S
WEARING THAT OUTFIT.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.037
YEAH, LAST TIME
I WORE THOSE SHORTS,
I GOT BEAT UP.

30:05.037 --> 30:06.505
( both laugh )

30:06.505 --> 30:08.007
BEAT UP?

30:08.007 --> 30:11.210
( Hawaiian music playing )

30:18.918 --> 30:20.953
GUESS WHAT'S
UNDER THESE COCONUTS?

30:20.953 --> 30:22.621
( chuckles )

30:22.621 --> 30:23.856
WHAT?

30:23.856 --> 30:27.026
IT'S A SURPRISE.

30:27.026 --> 30:30.396
WELL, I'VE GOT
A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.499
YOU GOT THE EXTENDER?

30:33.499 --> 30:35.334
( gulps )

30:35.334 --> 30:37.203
NO.

30:37.203 --> 30:40.606
NO, I TALKED
TO SUPERINTENDENT ZIMMER
THIS MORNING.

30:40.606 --> 30:43.509
- OH.
- HE'S SENDING
RICHARD MOFFITT HIMSELF

30:43.509 --> 30:45.711
TO OUR THANKSGIVING DAY
PARADE,

30:45.711 --> 30:47.346
CHECK IN HAND.

30:47.346 --> 30:50.149
OH, MONKEY,
THIS IS TOO EXCITING.

30:50.149 --> 30:52.051
OUR DREAM IS COMING TRUE.

30:52.051 --> 30:54.386
SMILE, SWEETHEART.

30:57.123 --> 30:58.490
( chuckling )

30:59.458 --> 31:02.128
MORE PICTURES
FOR THE CHEST.

31:05.831 --> 31:07.799
WHAT DO YOU KEEP
IN THERE?

31:07.799 --> 31:09.801
OH, THINGS.

31:09.801 --> 31:14.006
PHOTOS, TAPES.

31:14.006 --> 31:17.176
I TAPE EVERYTHING
THAT GOES ON IN THIS OFFICE.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.378
JUST LIKE THE PRESIDENT.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.981
JUST LIKE
THE PRESIDENT.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.150
COME HERE, MONKEY.

31:25.084 --> 31:27.853
- WHOO.
- Harry: HEY, IT'S UPSIDE DOWN.

31:27.853 --> 31:30.122
HERE, HOLD MY SACK.

31:30.122 --> 31:31.690
ALL RIGHT, ACCORDING
TO THE MAP,

31:31.690 --> 31:33.259
WE'RE ALMOST AT SCHOOL.

31:33.259 --> 31:35.694
YEAH, BUT WE STILL
HAVEN'T FOUND ANY TREASURE.

31:35.694 --> 31:37.396
( gasps )
HARRY...

31:39.465 --> 31:42.334
* HALLELUJAH,
HALLELUJAH... *

31:42.334 --> 31:44.536
WE MAY HAVE FOUND
SOMETHING EVEN BETTER.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.205
COME ON.

31:47.139 --> 31:49.275
IT'S OUR OWN
SPECIAL BUS, HARRY!

31:53.679 --> 31:55.247
HOW DO YOU KNOW
IT'S FOR US?

31:55.247 --> 31:57.483
BECAUSE COOL KIDS
ALWAYS SIT IN THE BACK
OF THE BUS, HARRY,

31:57.483 --> 31:59.318
AND HERE, EVERY ROW
IS THE BACK.

31:59.318 --> 32:01.553
WE'RE ALL COOL.
COME ON!

32:04.890 --> 32:06.792
CAREFUL, HARRY,
IT'S SHORT!

32:06.792 --> 32:08.694
HEY, HARRY,
I'M IN THE FRONT
OF THE BUS!

32:08.694 --> 32:11.363
- Harry: I'M IN THE BACK!
- Lloyd: I'M IN THE FRONT!

32:12.431 --> 32:14.333
TURK, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

32:14.333 --> 32:17.403
- SPECIAL NEEDS CLASS.
- BEING A JERK DOESN'T
MAKE YOU SPECIAL.

32:17.403 --> 32:21.073
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS.
THIS IS THE BEST CLASS EVER.

32:21.073 --> 32:23.242
SO DON'T RUIN IT!

32:26.545 --> 32:28.347
Heller:
SORRY, SPECIAL NEEDS ONLY.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.449
LOOK, MS. HELLER,
THERE'S SOMETHING
FISHY HERE.

32:30.449 --> 32:32.684
AND I DON'T THINK
IT'S FRIDAY'S SPECIAL.

32:32.684 --> 32:34.020
HMM. WELL,
I WOULDN'T KNOW,

32:34.020 --> 32:35.854
SINCE I'M JUST
THE TEACHER AND ALL.

32:35.854 --> 32:38.357
NOW LESS TALKING
AND MORE SITTING, HUH, GANG?

32:38.357 --> 32:42.394
LET'S GO, MARGIE,
THE MUSEUM AIN'T GONNA
TEACH ITSELF.

32:48.400 --> 32:51.637
THIS IS A MUCH BIGGER STORY
THAN FOUR-COLOR PENS.

32:56.742 --> 33:00.112
- ( tires squeal )
- * EVERY DAY I GET
IN THE QUEUE *

33:00.112 --> 33:04.583
- * Too much, magic bus *
- * TO GET ON THE BUS
THAT TAKES ME TO YOU *

33:04.583 --> 33:06.752
- * Too much, magic bus... *
- YOU WANT A SCOOP?

33:06.752 --> 33:09.821
- I'LL GIVE YOU A SCOOP.
- YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA
STOP FOR ICE CREAM?

33:09.821 --> 33:12.224
- NO. MAYBE.
- ( laughing )

33:12.224 --> 33:14.726
- * YOUR HOUSE IS ONLY
ANOTHER MILE... *
- LOSE HER.

33:14.726 --> 33:17.529
* Too much,
magic bus... *

33:21.500 --> 33:23.369
- SLUG BUG. SLUG BUG.
- OW! OW!

33:23.369 --> 33:24.970
CAN IT BE THE SAME ONE?
SLUG BUG!

33:24.970 --> 33:26.605
- OW!
- SLUG--
I CAN STILL SEE IT.

33:26.605 --> 33:28.974
- THAT'S NOT HOW YOU PLAY!
- PLAYING AUSTRALIAN RULES.

33:28.974 --> 33:31.143
DON'T LET HER PASS!

33:32.244 --> 33:35.347
* I DON'T CARE
HOW MUCH I PAY *

33:35.347 --> 33:37.183
* Too much,
magic bus... *

33:37.183 --> 33:40.586
- SCISSORS, SCISSORS.
- THIS IS TOO.

33:46.892 --> 33:48.594
- WHAT'S THAT?
- IT'S AN EAGLE.

33:48.594 --> 33:51.463
- THIS IS A BARRACUDA.
- FISH CAN'T EAT A BIRD.

33:55.534 --> 33:58.337
HA, HA, TOO BIG
TO MAKE THE TURN!

33:58.337 --> 34:01.073
- YOU CAN'T SQUISH
A BIRD WITH A PAPER CUT.
- YEAH, YOU CAN.

34:01.073 --> 34:03.875
- YEAH, YOU CAN.
- YOU CAN'T SQUISH--
NO, YOU CAN'T.

34:03.875 --> 34:06.078
( horn honking )

34:07.012 --> 34:09.215
- PUNCH BUGGY.
- OW!

34:11.250 --> 34:13.319
MARGIE, LOOK OUT!

34:16.855 --> 34:19.491
( slow motion )
HELP ME!

34:23.895 --> 34:25.464
( students cheering )

34:29.400 --> 34:32.904
* I SAID, NOW I'VE GOT
MY MAGIC BUS... *

34:32.904 --> 34:34.306
( horn honking )

34:34.306 --> 34:38.009
* NOW I'VE GOT
MY MAGIC BUS *

34:38.009 --> 34:40.812
* Too much, magic bus. *

34:40.812 --> 34:44.449
EVERYONE FIND A PARTNER.
YOU'RE NO GOOD TO ME DEAD.

34:44.449 --> 34:47.152
- Lloyd: HARRY, GET BACK HERE!
- I'M BACK, I'M BACK.

34:47.152 --> 34:48.654
- I'M GOING.
- HARRY? HARRY!

34:48.654 --> 34:50.856
Harry:
SPIN FASTER,
WE'LL GO BACK IN TIME!

34:50.856 --> 34:53.159
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.194
NO, NO, NO!
AAAH!

34:55.194 --> 34:56.995
WE GOT TO PARTNER UP.

34:56.995 --> 35:00.332
- WHAT DO YOU SAY, YOU AND ME?
- DREAM ON, DESPERADO.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.834
RIGHT, FIELD TRIP PARTNER
IS KIND OF A BIG COMMITMENT.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.003
I'M JOKING.
OF COURSE I'LL
BE YOUR PARTNER.

35:05.003 --> 35:08.507
WOW, YOU GOT SOME SERIOUS
SELF-WORTH ISSUES, MY PUDGY,
UGLY LITTLE FRIEND.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.876
- ( laughs )
- STOP IT, YOU'RE
EMBARRASSING ME.

35:10.876 --> 35:13.412
OKAY, SAY "FAJITAS."

35:13.412 --> 35:15.247
- All: FAJITAS!
- GOOD, GOT IT.

35:15.247 --> 35:17.115
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

35:17.115 --> 35:20.619
NOW-- EXCUSE ME.
HOW LONG DOES THE AVERAGE
FIELD TRIP TAKE HERE?

35:20.619 --> 35:24.890
WELL, TO FULLY EXPERIENCE
ALL WE HAVE TO OFFER,
IT TAKES TWO HOURS.

35:24.890 --> 35:27.092
TWO. OKAY.
YOU KNOW, I'LL BE
BACK IN FOUR.

35:27.092 --> 35:29.761
SO WHY DON'T YOU
GIVE THE TOUR TWICE,
AND SPEAK SLOWLY?

35:29.761 --> 35:31.797
- OH, WE DON'T
TAKE TIPS HERE.
- OH, SURE YOU DO.

35:31.797 --> 35:33.999
I KNOW YOU DON'T MAKE MUCH.
DON'T BE PROUD.

35:33.999 --> 35:36.235
DON'T BE PROUD.
IT'S GOING AWAY.
IT'S GOING AWAY.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.804
IT'S GOING AWAY.
IT'S OKAY. THAT'S
WHAT I THOUGHT.

35:38.804 --> 35:41.773
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.
- OKAY.

35:45.911 --> 35:48.647
Harry's voice:
I LIKE YOUR OUTFIT,
MR. POLAR BEAR.

35:48.647 --> 35:52.851
HMM. OKAY, I'M JUST
GOING TO TURN AND WALK AWAY.

35:54.986 --> 35:56.788
HA!

35:56.788 --> 35:58.890
OKAY...

35:58.890 --> 36:01.360
I'M WATCHING YOU.

36:01.360 --> 36:03.262
Jessica: HARRY?

36:03.262 --> 36:05.397
Harry's voice:
WHO TOLD YOU MY NAME?

36:05.397 --> 36:06.998
Jessica: HARRY?

36:06.998 --> 36:09.301
- HARRY?
- ( gasps )

36:09.301 --> 36:11.770
MS. HELLER SAID
NOT TO TALK TO YOU.

36:11.770 --> 36:14.206
THAT'S BECAUSE MS. HELLER
DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW

36:14.206 --> 36:16.375
THIS WHOLE THING
IS A SCAM.

36:16.375 --> 36:18.244
I KNEW IT WAS A FAKE.

36:18.244 --> 36:20.546
- YOU DID?
- YEAH. THOSE ESKIMOS?

36:20.546 --> 36:23.882
I'M SURE AT LEAST
ONE OF THEM IS A MANNEQUIN.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.551
HARRY, YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

36:25.551 --> 36:28.220
BUT LISTEN, I HAVE
TO ASK YOU A QUESTION
THAT MIGHT...

36:28.220 --> 36:29.688
PUT YOU IN
A DELICATE POSITION.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.757
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT YOUR DELICATES?

36:31.757 --> 36:35.661
ARE YOU TRYING TO BE FUNNY,
OR YOU ACTUALLY RE--

36:35.661 --> 36:37.429
SPECIAL?

36:37.429 --> 36:40.566
WE'RE ALL SPECIAL.
EVERYONE LLOYD AND I CHOSE
FOR THE CLASS IS SPECIAL.

36:40.566 --> 36:42.301
YOU AND LLOYD CHOSE
THE CLASS?

36:42.301 --> 36:43.535
MM-HMM.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.305
THIS IS ALL STARTING
TO MAKE SENSE.

36:46.305 --> 36:47.839
COULD YOU COME
TO MY HOUSE TONIGHT?

36:47.839 --> 36:50.642
- EXCUSE ME?
- WE NEED TO TALK.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.844
- COME OVER AROUND 7:00?
- O'CLOCK?

36:52.844 --> 36:54.880
YEAH.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.748
OKAY.

37:00.252 --> 37:01.820
A DATE.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.722
SHE SAID SOMETHING
ABOUT SOMETHING.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.757
Lloyd:
THAT'S PERFECT, HARRY.
THEN WHAT?

37:05.757 --> 37:09.661
THEN SHE SAID "7:00"
AND I SAID, "O'CLOCK!"

37:09.661 --> 37:11.830
( laughs )

37:11.830 --> 37:15.267
SORRY ABOUT THAT, BUDDY.
IT'S MY FIRST TIME BRINGING
A FRIEND UP THERE.

37:15.267 --> 37:16.568
- YOU OKAY?
- YEAH!

37:16.568 --> 37:19.271
SO YOU GOTTA
HELP ME OUT, LLOYD.

37:19.271 --> 37:21.373
A REAL LIVE DATE
WITH A REAL LIVE GIRL.

37:21.373 --> 37:23.041
WHO CARES?
CHICKS ARE FOR FAGS.

37:23.041 --> 37:25.677
I THINK SHE WANTS ME
TO COME OVER TO PUT ME
IN THE RIGHT POSITION

37:25.677 --> 37:27.379
TO CHECK OUT
HER DELICATES.

37:27.379 --> 37:30.248
- WHATEVER THAT MEANS.
- OH YEAH, BUDDY, YOU'RE
GONNA GET SOME.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.617
- SOME WHAT?
- YOU KNOW.

37:31.617 --> 37:33.652
SHE'LL BE ALL OVER YOU
LIKE A BARRELFUL OF MONKEYS

37:33.652 --> 37:35.487
WITH THAT SHORT SKIRT
AND THAT TIGHT SHIRT.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.255
OOH, IT'S SO FAGGY I CAN'T
EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.

37:37.255 --> 37:39.891
- COME ON, LLOYD.
- OKAY, IF YOU'RE
GONNA DO THIS,

37:39.891 --> 37:43.028
BRING HER
SOMETHING SPECIAL.
BUY HER SOME CHOCOLATE--

37:43.028 --> 37:44.296
THE BEST YOU CAN FIND.

37:44.296 --> 37:46.365
Harry:
SEEMS SIMPLE ENOUGH.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.734
( coins jingling )

37:55.441 --> 37:57.443
( imitates knocking )
KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.

37:57.443 --> 37:59.378
( laughs )
HELLO, JESSICA.

37:59.378 --> 38:01.513
IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU,
JESSICA.

38:01.513 --> 38:03.849
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

38:03.849 --> 38:07.252
HI, JESSICA.
DO YOU REMEMBER ME
FROM BEFORE?

38:07.252 --> 38:09.154
I'M HARRY.
( laughs )

38:09.154 --> 38:11.022
THAT'S STUPID!
OKAY.

38:11.022 --> 38:14.493
HELLO, JESSICA.
HARRY-- MRS. HARRY JESSICA.

38:14.493 --> 38:17.162
MR. HARRY JESSICA.

38:17.162 --> 38:19.431
- J-E-S-S-I-S-S-I--
- HARRY?

38:19.431 --> 38:20.666
HARRY, HI.

38:20.666 --> 38:23.001
DO YOU WANT
TO COME INSIDE?

38:24.736 --> 38:27.373
OKAY. WIPE YOUR FEET.
MY PARENTS ARE TOTALLY ANAL.

38:27.373 --> 38:29.040
OH, THAT'S GROSS.

38:29.040 --> 38:32.077
- WOULD YOU LIKE
SOMETHING TO DRINK?
- YEAH, BUT I'M BUYING.

38:32.077 --> 38:35.213
HARRY, I HAVE A LOT
OF QUESTIONS TO GO
OVER WITH YOU,

38:35.213 --> 38:36.682
SO LET'S JUST
GO UPSTAIRS.

38:36.682 --> 38:40.686
GOOD PLAN.
I'M NOT REALLY READY
FOR DOWNSTAIRS.

38:40.686 --> 38:42.754
HARRY, YOU'RE SO FUNNY.

38:42.754 --> 38:44.990
REALLY?
I'M NOT EVEN TRYING.

38:44.990 --> 38:49.361
- ARE YOU COMING?
- ( scoffs ) YEAH.

38:49.361 --> 38:52.097
I'LL RACE YA!

38:52.097 --> 38:55.667
- HARRY, STOP
HORSING AROUND.
- OH, BOY.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.936
OKAY, THERE'S A LOT
TO GO OVER, HARRY,

38:57.936 --> 38:59.705
SO IT MAY GET
HARD FOR YOU.

38:59.705 --> 39:02.173
HARD FOR ME?
HARD FOR ME?

39:02.173 --> 39:03.409
HARD FOR ME?

39:03.409 --> 39:04.710
HARRY, DO YOU WANT
TO SIT DOWN?

39:04.710 --> 39:07.245
- NO, NO, I'M OKAY.
- OKAY.

39:07.245 --> 39:10.449
I THINK COLLINS AND HELLER
ARE EMBEZZLING MONEY
FROM THE SCHOOL,

39:10.449 --> 39:12.050
AND I THINK IT'S
BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.085
I JUST HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
SOME WAY TO PROVE IT.

39:14.085 --> 39:16.121
I MEAN, IT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE TO ME.

39:16.121 --> 39:18.890
BUT I GUESS THERE'S GOT
TO BE A GOOD EXPLANATION.

39:18.890 --> 39:21.393
HELLER WORE
A COCONUT BRA...

39:21.393 --> 39:25.431
Harry's voice:
WOW, SHE'S REALLY MAKING ME
FEEL HOT.

39:26.798 --> 39:31.002
WHAT'S WORSE
IS I THINK THE ENTIRE
SPECIAL NEEDS CLASS IS A SCAM.

39:31.002 --> 39:32.771
BUT... I NEED PROOF.

39:32.771 --> 39:36.107
Harry's voice:
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH
LONGER I CAN STAND IT.

39:36.107 --> 39:38.544
I DIDN'T THINK THE FIRST TIME
WOULD HURT SO MUCH.

39:38.544 --> 39:41.647
- ESPECIALLY IN THE ASS!
- WHAT?!

39:41.647 --> 39:45.884
HARRY, I'M IN A POSITION
WHERE I REALLY NEED YOUR HELP.

39:45.884 --> 39:47.586
P-POSITION?

39:47.586 --> 39:49.354
GREAT.
HAVE YOU A BATHROOM?

39:49.354 --> 39:51.657
YEAH, DOWN THE HALL.

39:53.492 --> 39:55.360
I'LL BE BACK
IN A JIFF.

39:55.360 --> 39:57.128
( whimpering )

40:10.008 --> 40:11.176
( screams )

40:12.744 --> 40:15.714
OKAY, OKAY.
WATER!

40:17.549 --> 40:19.618
( screams )

40:20.852 --> 40:22.621
OH, I COULDN'T.
I DIDN'T.

40:22.621 --> 40:25.423
NO, NO, NO, NO.
OH, WHAT'S IN THERE?

40:31.129 --> 40:33.131
( sniffs )
MMM.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.874
NO, IT CAN'T BE.

40:45.176 --> 40:46.778
OHH.

40:49.014 --> 40:50.616
OH! NO.

40:51.449 --> 40:53.018
( groaning )
OH, I DIDN'T--

40:54.720 --> 40:56.454
OH, NO, NO, NO!

40:57.989 --> 40:59.691
( repeating )
OH NO, NO, NO...

41:01.993 --> 41:03.228
( grunting )

41:03.228 --> 41:05.831
HARRY?
YOU'VE BEEN
IN THERE A WHILE.

41:05.831 --> 41:07.799
- ARE YOU OKAY?
- ARE YOU KIDDIN'?

41:07.799 --> 41:09.267
I COULDN'T BE MORE OKAY.

41:09.267 --> 41:11.302

41:57.215 --> 41:59.885
LLOYD, WHAT ARE

41:59.885 --> 42:01.553
I CAME TO CHECK

42:01.553 --> 42:03.589
I KINDA SCREWED
THINGS UP.

42:03.589 --> 42:05.223
I'M SURE YOU'RE
OVERREACTING.

42:05.223 --> 42:06.892
I DON'T THINK SO.

42:06.892 --> 42:10.228
HARRY, WHY ARE YOU
COVERED IN POO?

42:10.228 --> 42:12.163
I-- I DON'T KNOW!

42:12.163 --> 42:14.800
- OKAY.
- SHE ASKED ME
TO STAY FOR DINNER.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.902
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HER.

42:16.902 --> 42:19.304
OH, OKAY, I GOT AN IDEA!
I SAW THIS IN A MOVIE ONCE.

42:19.304 --> 42:21.907
IT WAS A GOOD ONE.
GO DOWN TO THIS WINDOW
RIGHT HERE,

42:21.907 --> 42:23.975
OPEN IT UP, AND THEN
SAY WHATEVER I SAY.

42:23.975 --> 42:26.111
OKAY, THANKS.
I GOT TO FIND SOME CLOTHES.

48:54.532 --> 48:57.969
MAYBE IT'S THIS...
MIX TAPE I MADE YOU.

LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD.

49:58.296 --> 50:00.965
DID YOU AT LEAST
ENJOY YOURSELF?

50:00.965 --> 50:04.001
NO, IT WAS
A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.

50:05.103 --> 50:06.637
( stuttering )

50:06.637 --> 50:08.206
THIS IS--
THIS IS EMBARRASSING.

50:08.206 --> 50:09.907
THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED

THANKS, LLOYD,
BUT I DIDN'T FIND
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

50:24.289 --> 50:26.657
AND CAN YOU DO ME A FAVOR
AND CLEAN THIS PLACE UP?

50:26.657 --> 50:29.127
PRINCIPAL COLLINS
CAN'T KNOW THAT WE WERE HERE.

50:29.127 --> 50:31.096
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.

I COULDN'T STAND
BEING WITH HER KNOWING

51:33.291 --> 51:34.892

OUR FRIENDSHIP.

51:34.892 --> 51:37.328
OH, YOU KNOW, AND ALSO
SHE HAD A BOYFRIEND.

51:37.328 --> 51:39.029

51:43.668 --> 51:47.705
HEY TH-- THERE'S NO REASON

51:47.705 --> 51:52.310
GOOD ONE, CAPTAIN ROB.
HE DOES LOOK LIKE
A YOU-KNOW-WHAT.

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:15.559
AND I'M LIKE, "WHOA,"
AND SHE'S LIKE, "OH."

01:03:15.559 --> 01:03:17.627
AND I'M LIKE...

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:21.331
IT'S BRENDA.
I'M NEW.

01:03:23.901 --> 01:03:26.503
Lloyd: OH!
ICE, ICE, BABY.

01:03:30.407 --> 01:03:32.042
( mocking grunts )

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:35.512
YEAH, I PEED IN THOSE.
ENJOY.

01:03:35.512 --> 01:03:38.315
( grunting continues )

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:40.117
GROW UP.

01:03:45.089 --> 01:03:47.057
- YOU'RE IT.
- ARE NOT.

01:03:47.057 --> 01:03:48.692
- ARE TOO.
- D2.

01:03:48.692 --> 01:03:50.527
- CHEWBACCA.
- OOH, GOOD ONE, HARRY.

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:51.528
HEY, IT'S JESSICA.

01:03:51.528 --> 01:03:54.464
HARRY, I THOUGHT
WE WORKED THROUGH THIS.

01:03:54.464 --> 01:03:56.533
NO, IT'S JESSICA.

01:03:56.533 --> 01:03:59.236
Lloyd:
OH, MUST BE
HER BOYFRIEND'S CAR.

01:03:59.236 --> 01:04:03.240
- IT'S PRINCIPAL COLLINS!
- PRINCIPAL COLLINS IS
JESSICA'S BOYFRIEND?

01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.942
OH, THAT TOTALLY
MAKES SENSE.

01:04:04.942 --> 01:04:06.476
THAT'S WHY SHE DIDN'T
WANT HIM TO KNOW

01:04:06.476 --> 01:04:08.212
WE WERE IN HIS OFFICE
THE OTHER NIGHT.

01:04:08.212 --> 01:04:10.480
HE CAN'T SEE US HERE.
QUICK, BE CONSPICUOUS!

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.916
CONSPICUOUS?

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:18.055
( whistling )

01:04:18.055 --> 01:04:19.689
NO WONDER WE BOTH
STRUCK OUT WITH HER.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:22.392
HOW CAN WE COMPETE WITH
THE SEXUAL POWER OF THE MAN

01:04:22.392 --> 01:04:24.761
WHO OCCUPIES
THE HIGHEST OFFICE
IN THE LAND.

01:04:24.761 --> 01:04:26.096
YEAH, HE'S LIKE
THE POPE, HARRY.

01:04:26.096 --> 01:04:28.132
LIKE WE'RE GONNA
SNAKE A CHICK FROM THE POPE.

01:04:30.134 --> 01:04:32.602
- ( engine starts )
- HERE HE COMES.

01:04:32.602 --> 01:04:34.004
HARRY, SWITCH.

01:04:34.004 --> 01:04:36.440
HARRY.
JEEZ, MOSES AND MARY.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:39.576
( whistling )

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:46.016
HEY, LET'S GO
SPY ON THEM.

01:04:46.016 --> 01:04:47.617
GOOD THINKING, HARRY.

01:04:49.286 --> 01:04:52.422
- HARRY, BOBSLED!
- LEVER!

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:55.159
HANG TWO!
HARRY, GO LEFT!

01:04:55.159 --> 01:04:56.961
GO LEFT.
CEASE AND DESIST!

01:04:56.961 --> 01:04:59.129
- CEASE AND DESIST!
- ( horn honks )

01:04:59.129 --> 01:05:01.465
COME ON, HARRY!
MUSH, MUSH, MUSH.

01:05:01.465 --> 01:05:04.634
HARRY, GO STRAIGHT.
WARP SPEED, HARRY.
WARP SPEED!

01:05:18.148 --> 01:05:20.617
( screaming )

01:05:24.854 --> 01:05:26.923
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU'VE GOT?

01:05:26.923 --> 01:05:29.826
HEY, THAT'S MY CART.

01:05:29.826 --> 01:05:31.728
( cheering )

01:05:31.728 --> 01:05:35.732
* IT'S THE EYE OF THE TIGER,
IT'S THE THRILL OF THE FIGHT *

01:05:35.732 --> 01:05:39.769
* RISIN' UP TO THE CHALLENGE
OF OUR RIVALS *

01:05:39.769 --> 01:05:44.874
* AND THE LAST KNOWN
SURVIVOR STALKS HIS PREY
IN THE NIGHT... *

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:46.810
- ( music jingling )
- ICE CREAM?

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:49.179
ARE YOU THINKING
WHAT I'M THINKING, HARRY?

01:05:49.179 --> 01:05:52.382
- OH YEAH.
- SNACK BREAK!

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.696
Harry: YUMMY!

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:10.734
- AAAH! ALL RIGHT--
- HARRY!

01:06:10.734 --> 01:06:13.370
- THERE THEY ARE!
- BREAK'S OVER!

01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:16.573
SO WHAT DID YOU TELL
MY PARENTS ON THE PHONE?

01:06:16.573 --> 01:06:18.608
NOT TO EXPECT YOU
TONIGHT.

01:06:18.608 --> 01:06:21.078
WELL, SOMEONE'S GOING
TO COME LOOKING FOR ME.

01:06:21.078 --> 01:06:23.413
OH, I DON'T THINK SO,
MY DEAR.

01:06:23.413 --> 01:06:27.017
* THE EYE OF THE TIGER. *

01:06:33.323 --> 01:06:35.859
I'M GOING TO ASK YOU
ONE MORE TIME.

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:37.961
JESSICA,

01:06:37.961 --> 01:06:39.629
WHERE'S MY CHEST?

01:06:39.629 --> 01:06:41.698
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:06:47.971 --> 01:06:50.507
DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT, HMM?

01:06:50.507 --> 01:06:53.577
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?!

01:06:55.912 --> 01:06:57.347
WELL, WELL, WELL.

01:07:00.684 --> 01:07:03.653
WHAT HAVE WE HERE?
IT APPEARS TO BE A TAPE.

01:07:03.653 --> 01:07:06.990
- THAT'S NOT YOUR TAPE.
- DON'T PLAY WITH ME, DEAR.

01:07:06.990 --> 01:07:10.160
YOU'RE WAY
OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE.

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:19.603
- ( tapping on window )
- Harry: JESSICA!

01:07:19.603 --> 01:07:22.706
HARRY, LLOYD.

01:07:22.706 --> 01:07:25.342
YOU GUYS ARE A MESS.

01:07:25.342 --> 01:07:29.045
Harry:
WE WERE STILL HUNGRY, SO WE
DECIDED TO GET SOME DESSERT.

01:07:29.045 --> 01:07:31.014
- IT WAS FUN.
- Lloyd: YEAH.

01:07:31.014 --> 01:07:34.418
IT WAS FUN UNTIL HARRY
DECIDED TO PUT HIS WIENER
IN MY EAR.

01:07:34.418 --> 01:07:36.186
- SORRY ABOUT THAT.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

01:07:36.186 --> 01:07:37.754
SO IT LOOKS LIKE
THE BEST MAN WON.

01:07:37.754 --> 01:07:40.524
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL US
YOUR BOYFRIEND WAS
PRINCIPAL COLLINS?

01:07:40.524 --> 01:07:42.092
WHAT?

01:07:42.092 --> 01:07:44.828
Lloyd on tape: Jessica!

01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:49.499
- * You light up my life... *
- IS THAT MY MIX TAPE?

01:07:49.499 --> 01:07:52.102
IT'S BEING USED
FOR YOUR SEDUCTION?

01:07:52.102 --> 01:07:53.903
I'M FLATTERED.

01:07:53.903 --> 01:07:56.606
LLOYD, WHEN WE WERE
IN PRINCIPAL COLLINS OFFICE,

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:58.508
DID YOU SEE ANY KIND
OF CHEST?

01:07:58.508 --> 01:08:01.010
YOU MEAN LIKE HARRY'S
TREASURE CHEST? SURE,
I KNOW WHERE THAT IS.

01:08:01.010 --> 01:08:03.347
YOU FOUND MY TREASURE?
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

01:08:03.347 --> 01:08:07.117
THREE WORDS-- I DID.
YOU WERE JUST ALL MAD AT ME.
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN LISTEN.

01:08:07.117 --> 01:08:09.386
- YEAH, WELL,
I'M LISTENING NOW.
- ME TOO.

01:08:09.386 --> 01:08:11.855
- THIS IS MY FAVORITE PART.
- HARRY, LLOYD,

01:08:11.855 --> 01:08:14.158
LISTEN TO ME, I ONLY HAVE
TIME TO SAY THIS ONCE.

01:08:14.158 --> 01:08:16.393
Lloyd's voice:
GOD, SHE'S SO CUTE.

01:08:16.393 --> 01:08:18.295
LOOK AT HER TEETH.

01:08:18.295 --> 01:08:20.997
I BET SHE CAN
BITE THROUGH ANYTHING.

01:08:20.997 --> 01:08:23.032
YEAH, SHE COULD.

01:08:23.032 --> 01:08:26.102
YOU GOTTA GET
WHAT'S IN THE CHEST,
AND MAKE SURE EVERYBODY...

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.537
Harry's voice:
I WONDER WHAT LLOYD'S
THINKING ABOUT.

01:08:28.537 --> 01:08:33.009
LOOK AT ALL THAT HAIR.
SHE MUST HAVE MILLIONS
OF TINY HOLES IN HER HEAD.

01:08:33.009 --> 01:08:36.279
OTHERWISE, IT WOULD JUST
BUNCH UP ALL IN HER BRAIN.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:39.515
SO GUYS,
ARE YOU LISTENING TO ME?

01:08:39.515 --> 01:08:41.785
- YEAH, SURE!
- YEAH, YEAH.

01:08:41.785 --> 01:08:43.853
- I WAS, YOU KNOW--
- YEAH, SURE.

01:08:43.853 --> 01:08:48.457
- ( singing continuing )
- ( tape forwards )

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:51.127
Lloyd on tape:
I'm a Pisces.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:54.497
And that's
the sign of the badger.
I love picnics...

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:55.965
YOU GUYS GOTTA GO
GET THAT CHEST,

01:08:55.965 --> 01:08:58.100
AND SHOW THE WORLD
WHAT COLLINS HAS BEEN DOING.

01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:01.104
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I CAN GET OUT OF THIS
ANYTIME I WANT.

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:04.308
AND I'M GETTING THE STORY
EVERY HIGH SCHOOL REPORTER
DREAMS OF.

01:09:04.308 --> 01:09:06.643
Lloyd on tape:
Come on, Jessica.

01:09:06.643 --> 01:09:09.246
Don't push me,
'cause I'm...

01:09:09.246 --> 01:09:10.846
GO, GET OUT OF HERE.

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:15.752
( banging )

01:09:18.255 --> 01:09:19.823
- GOTCHA, YOU--
- STOP!

01:09:19.823 --> 01:09:21.890
- WHAT?
- I DON'T THINK THIS IS
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:24.961
HARRY, WE DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHAT'S IN THERE.
YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

01:09:24.961 --> 01:09:27.197
I DON'T KNOW
WHO WE ARE ANYMORE.

01:09:27.197 --> 01:09:28.598
YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:09:28.598 --> 01:09:30.500
BUT I FEEL LIKE I DESERVE
MUCH MORE OF THIS TREASURE

01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:33.036
- 'CAUSE I WAS
THE ONE THAT FOUND IT.
- MY MOM GAVE ME THE MAP.

01:09:33.036 --> 01:09:36.273
- BUT I LUGGED IT ALL OVER TOWN.
- I MADE THE POLAR BEAR PANTS.

01:09:36.273 --> 01:09:38.442
- I ATE YOUR MOM'S PIE!
- I FOUND THAT ROCK!

01:09:38.442 --> 01:09:40.310
IT WAS A DIAMOND,
AND YOU SWALLOWED IT.

01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:41.611
WE WERE ALL OUT
OF TOP HATS.

01:09:41.611 --> 01:09:44.247
ENOUGH! WHAT HAS
THIS CURSED CHEST DONE TO US?

01:09:44.247 --> 01:09:46.716
YOU KNOW, LLOYD,

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:50.520
THE REAL TREASURE
IS OUR FRIENDSHIP.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.856
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
ON THE OTHER HAND...

01:09:58.828 --> 01:10:00.297
OH.

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:07.504
- WHAT'S ALL THIS?
- ( sniffing )

01:10:09.639 --> 01:10:12.476
OH...
IT'S FULL OF FILES.

01:10:12.476 --> 01:10:14.244
THERE'S PICTURES

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:15.945
AND DOCUMENTS.

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:18.782
IT'S AMAZING!
( sniffs )

01:10:18.782 --> 01:10:20.650
OHHH.

01:10:22.519 --> 01:10:24.721
HEY, LLOYD, THIS LOOKS
LIKE ONE OF YOUR MIX TAPES.

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:27.457
MAYBE IT'S FROM THE PIRATE
WHO BURIED THIS TREASURE.

01:10:27.457 --> 01:10:29.559
YOU SHOULD GO
PUT IT ON.

01:10:33.597 --> 01:10:35.999
Collins on tape:
Principal's log,
September 23rd.

01:10:35.999 --> 01:10:37.734
Check, check, check.
Sound check.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:39.603
HEY, IT'S
PRINCIPAL COLLINS.

01:10:39.603 --> 01:10:42.306
THAT MAKES TOTAL SENSE.
I FOUND THE TREASURE CHEST
IN HIS OFFICE.

01:10:42.306 --> 01:10:45.675
- grant money...
- THIS MIX TAPE ISN'T
AS GOOD AS YOURS, LLOYD.

01:10:45.675 --> 01:10:47.511
- NO.
- Sound, check,
check, check.

01:10:47.511 --> 01:10:50.547
- HE SPEAKS PRETTY GOOD CHINESE.
- THAT'S NOT CHINESE.

01:10:50.547 --> 01:10:54.050
- ( tape squeaking )
- THAT'S CHINESE.

01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:55.585
- YEAH.
- OH YEAH.

01:10:55.585 --> 01:10:58.322
And that is how I,
Principal Collins,

01:10:58.322 --> 01:11:02.225
became the mastermind
behind this glorious plan.

01:11:02.225 --> 01:11:04.227
It's the crime
of the century.

01:11:04.227 --> 01:11:08.131
HE'S RIGHT.
WE HAVE COMMITTED THE CRIME
OF THE CENTURY.

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:11.435
WE NEVER
THANKED HIM FOR GIVING US
THE SPECIAL NEEDS CLASS!

01:11:11.435 --> 01:11:13.703
BUT WHAT DO WE DO?

01:11:14.971 --> 01:11:17.441
- ( snaps )
- Lloyd: I HAVE AN IDEA.

01:11:17.441 --> 01:11:19.476
( parade music playing )

01:11:22.446 --> 01:11:24.714
P.A.: Welcome to
the Providence Hills
High School

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:26.516
Thanksgiving parade!

01:11:26.516 --> 01:11:29.052
Aren't you glad
you're not watching football?

01:11:29.052 --> 01:11:32.322
This year's theme,
white meat or dark?

01:11:34.858 --> 01:11:37.927
Floats and exhibits from
all classes and organizations.

01:11:37.927 --> 01:11:40.430
So enjoy.

01:11:40.430 --> 01:11:42.532
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:44.067
WHAT DID
YOU MORONS DO?

01:11:44.067 --> 01:11:46.836
WHERE'S GEORGE WASHINGTON?
WHAT DO WE DO WITH THIS?

01:11:46.836 --> 01:11:48.972
- LOOKS GREAT, DOESN'T HE?
- NO.

01:11:48.972 --> 01:11:53.309
- WHAT WERE YOU GUYS THINKING?
- Terri: WHY'D YOU GIVE HIM
A MAKEOVER?

01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:55.044
( panting )

01:11:55.044 --> 01:11:57.681
SORRY I'M LATE.
WOKE UP TIED TO THE BED.

01:11:57.681 --> 01:12:00.684
SOMEBODY CUT MY HAIR
WHILE I WAS SLEEPING.

01:12:00.684 --> 01:12:03.019
HEY, THAT'S MY HAIR!

01:12:04.354 --> 01:12:08.492
It's the marching band's
musical tribute to stuffing.

01:12:09.693 --> 01:12:13.296
Please do not throw cigarettes
at the floats.

01:12:13.296 --> 01:12:15.965
I'VE SEARCHED EVERYWHERE
AND NO LUCK.

01:12:15.965 --> 01:12:17.834
THE CHEST IS
STILL OUT THERE.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:20.770
THAT'S WHY WE GET THE CHECK
AS SOON AS ZIMMER SHOWS UP

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:24.340
AND BLOW THIS POP STAND BEFORE
ANYBODY FINDS OUT ANYTHING.

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.142
THE BAND
SOUNDS TERRIBLE.

01:12:26.142 --> 01:12:29.846
I KNOW, I SOLD ALL
THE WIND INSTRUMENTS.

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:32.181
HAWAIIAN AIR,
BUSINESS CLASS.

01:12:32.181 --> 01:12:33.517
( laughing )

01:12:33.517 --> 01:12:35.051
- YOU LIKE YOUR NEW COAT?
- I LOVE IT.

01:12:35.051 --> 01:12:38.955
THAT'S WHY OUR MASCOT
ISN'T A STALLION ANYMORE.

01:12:38.955 --> 01:12:41.391
- THIS IS HORSE?
- NO, NO, NO,
I SOLD THE HORSE,

01:12:41.391 --> 01:12:44.594
- TO PAY FOR THE--
- I DIDN'T KNOW HORSE
COULD FEEL THIS SOFT.

01:12:44.594 --> 01:12:47.831
THAT'S NOT HORSE, HONEY.
YES, YES, IT IS SOFT.

01:12:47.831 --> 01:12:48.865
( whistles )

01:12:48.865 --> 01:12:50.199
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THE FLOAT?

01:12:50.199 --> 01:12:52.869
- GUYS, THIS IS MUCH BETTER.
- YEAH.

01:12:52.869 --> 01:12:54.938
PRINCIPAL COLLINS IS
A WAY GREATER AMERICAN

01:12:54.938 --> 01:12:56.773
THAN GEORGE WASHINGTON
WILL EVER BE.

01:12:56.773 --> 01:12:58.542
I DON'T GET IT.
WHY'D YOU MAKE HIM
A PIRATE?

01:12:58.542 --> 01:13:01.411
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.
YOU WON'T BELIEVE
THESE DOCUMENTS.

01:13:01.411 --> 01:13:05.148
THEY PROVIDE EVIDENCE
OF A LONG HISTORY OF FRAUD
AND EMBEZZLEMENT

01:13:05.148 --> 01:13:08.652
FROM THE SCHOOL
BY PRINCIPAL COLLINS
AND MS. HELLER,

01:13:08.652 --> 01:13:10.720
A.K.A. THE LUNCH LADY.

01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:13.289
- HUH?
- MY GOD, CAN YOU
BELIEVE YOUR EARS?

01:13:13.289 --> 01:13:15.592
YEAH, NO CLICKS
AND WHISTLES.

01:13:15.592 --> 01:13:17.427
SHE SPEAKS THE ENGLISH
PERFECTLY.

01:13:17.427 --> 01:13:19.195
LLOYD, YOU'RE
A GREAT TEACHER.

01:13:19.195 --> 01:13:22.065
CHING CHONG,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR
BEAUTIFUL ASIAN ACCENT?

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:25.435
OH, ACTUALLY MY NAME
IS CINDY.

01:13:25.435 --> 01:13:27.904
THE ACCENT JUST
HELPS ME MEET BOYS.

01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:30.807
YOU WANT IT BACK?

01:13:31.975 --> 01:13:33.977
( with accent )
YOU GOT IT, JOE.

01:13:35.378 --> 01:13:38.014
LOOK AT THIS.
COLLINS TOOK $2000

01:13:38.014 --> 01:13:41.585
THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO GO
TO A NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART
STALLION MASCOT UNIFORM.

01:13:41.585 --> 01:13:43.553
WAIT, WHAT?
LET ME SEE.

01:13:43.553 --> 01:13:47.423
WHY HAVE I BEEN
WEARING THIS ONE
WITH PUKE IN THE HEAD?

01:13:47.423 --> 01:13:49.058
- YOU SERIOUS?
- AM I-- SMELL.

01:13:49.058 --> 01:13:51.795
WE GOT TO TELL PEOPLE
ABOUT COLLINS.

01:13:56.466 --> 01:13:59.068
- HEY, SUPERINTENDENT.
- I'M NOT SURE I CAN DO THIS.

01:13:59.068 --> 01:14:01.137
WE GOT TO NAIL THIS GUY.
YOU'LL BE FINE.

01:14:01.137 --> 01:14:03.540
JUST MAKE SURE
HE TAKES THAT CHECK.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:06.275
DETECTIVE, YOU KNOW,

01:14:06.275 --> 01:14:09.378
HE'S GONNA BE EXPECTING
MOFFITT TO BE... SPECIAL.

01:14:09.378 --> 01:14:12.682
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I STUDIED ACTING AT
THE POLICE ACADEMY.

01:14:12.682 --> 01:14:15.785
- POLICE ACADEMY?
- YOU'LL BE FINE.

01:14:15.785 --> 01:14:18.488
JUST REMEMBER YOUR LINES.
IT'S SHOW TIME.

01:14:24.694 --> 01:14:28.264
- PRINCIPAL COLLINS.
- SUPERINTENDENT ZIMMER.

01:14:28.264 --> 01:14:29.566
- HELLO.
- HELLO, HELLO.

01:14:29.566 --> 01:14:31.167
I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU
TO RICHARD MOFFITT,

01:14:31.167 --> 01:14:34.671
FORMER SPECIAL NEEDS STUDENT,
NOW AMERICAN SUCCESS STORY.

01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:37.273
- WELL...
- GO AHEAD.

01:14:37.273 --> 01:14:41.377
IT'S A VERY GREAT
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, SIR.

01:14:41.377 --> 01:14:43.713
VERY...

01:14:43.713 --> 01:14:45.114
VERY GREAT PLEASURE.

01:14:48.585 --> 01:14:50.854
WELL, IS THAT
WHAT I THINK IT IS?

01:14:50.854 --> 01:14:53.356
YOUR LITTLE GIFT
FOR THE SCHOOL?

01:14:53.356 --> 01:14:55.324
YES.

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:57.193
I DREW THIS.

01:14:58.427 --> 01:15:00.096
SPECIAL NEEDS.

01:15:00.096 --> 01:15:03.066
- TIME FOR FRENCH FRIES NOW.
- OH, YES.

01:15:03.066 --> 01:15:06.335
BUT THE CHECK WILL BE
PRESENTED THIS MORNING?

01:15:06.335 --> 01:15:08.672
I'M VERY STRONG.

01:15:08.672 --> 01:15:12.108
YES, YOU ARE.
I HAVE YOUR CHECK RIGHT HERE.

01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:14.477
BUT I THINK MR. MOFFITT
IS INTERESTED IN SEEING

01:15:14.477 --> 01:15:16.112
THE SPECIAL NEEDS FLOAT
FIRST.

01:15:16.112 --> 01:15:20.483
I CAN TURN ON
ALL THE FAUCETS IN MY HOUSE.

01:15:20.483 --> 01:15:22.418
EVEN THE HOSE.

01:15:22.418 --> 01:15:24.921
- BUT WE DON'T DRINK
FROM THE HOSE, DO WE?
- NO.

01:15:24.921 --> 01:15:26.956
P.A.: There's
the special needs float.

01:15:26.956 --> 01:15:30.126
OH, HERE THEY COME!
WAIT TILL YOU SEE WHAT
THE CHILDREN HAVE DONE.

01:15:30.126 --> 01:15:31.828
YES.

01:15:31.828 --> 01:15:34.130
Collins's voice:
This is visionary.

01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:38.735
I think I've finally figured
out a way to bilk this school
out of enough money

01:15:38.735 --> 01:15:40.837
to get us that condo
in Waikiki.

01:15:40.837 --> 01:15:44.240
- Heller's voice:
Baby, you've done it all.
- Collins: Small potatoes.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:46.175
The Richard Moffitt
Special Needs Grant.

01:15:46.175 --> 01:15:48.645
The State is giving
100 grand in his name

01:15:48.645 --> 01:15:52.616
- to every school that has...
- THAT SOUNDS LIKE YOU!

01:15:52.616 --> 01:15:54.250
OH MY GOD,
THEY GOT THE CHEST.

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:56.720
- Heller: You got the extender?
- Collins: No.

01:15:56.720 --> 01:15:59.422
NOTHING THEY DO MAKES
ANY SENSE, WHICH IS--
WHICH IS--

01:15:59.422 --> 01:16:04.093
- WHICH IS WHY WE CREATED
THE SPECIAL NEEDS CLASS...
- ( siren blares )

01:16:04.093 --> 01:16:06.062
Man:
YOU'RE GOING DOWN, COLLINS!

01:16:06.062 --> 01:16:08.131
AND WHY WE NEED THAT CHECK.

01:16:08.131 --> 01:16:10.800
Girl:
HE STOLE THE SCHOOL'S MONEY!

01:16:12.035 --> 01:16:13.770
PONY.

01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:15.939
HEY, THERE'S
PRINCIPAL COLLINS!

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:21.745
P.A.:
Please remain seated.

01:16:21.745 --> 01:16:23.212
Girl:
SOMEBODY STOP HIM!

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:26.015
HUH, HE'S COMING BACK.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.589
- ( fabric tears )
- HEY, HEY!

01:16:33.589 --> 01:16:36.225
WOW! GO!

01:16:36.225 --> 01:16:38.527
HEY, HEY!

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:40.296
- HEY!
- ( laughing )

01:16:40.296 --> 01:16:43.132
Collins's voice:
Check in hand.

01:16:43.132 --> 01:16:46.469
ALL I WANTED
WAS A CONDO IN WAIKIKI.

01:16:46.469 --> 01:16:49.105
- WATCH YOUR HANDS, PIGGY!
- GET IN THE CAR.

01:16:49.105 --> 01:16:52.008
WOW, THEY GET
THEIR OWN POLICE ESCORT.

01:16:52.008 --> 01:16:53.843
- ( siren blares )
- WHOA.

01:16:53.843 --> 01:16:55.444
ALL OUR HARD WORK
PAYS OFF.

01:16:55.444 --> 01:16:57.747
- YEAH?
- HE'S GOING TO JAIL
FOR A LONG TIME.

01:16:57.747 --> 01:17:00.249
PRINCIPAL OF JAIL?
WOW, THAT'S A PROMOTION.

01:17:00.249 --> 01:17:02.385
- YEAH, THOSE INMATES
ARE LUCKY.
- YEAH.

01:17:02.385 --> 01:17:05.121
- HEY, JESSICA!
- HI!

01:17:05.121 --> 01:17:07.156
I-- I GUESS
I'LL SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

01:17:08.524 --> 01:17:11.160
OH MY GOD.
SHE'S TWO-TIMING
PRINCIPAL COLLINS.

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:13.229
Lloyd:
YEAH, WITH THAT
COMPLETE LOSER.

01:17:13.229 --> 01:17:16.199
- Harry: HE'S PROBABLY A JOCK.
- JESSICA, WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING?

01:17:16.199 --> 01:17:18.802
CHECK OUT THOSE STUPID
BUTT-UGLY JEANS.

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:23.873
HAS SOURED ME ON WOMEN
FOREVER.

01:17:23.873 --> 01:17:26.409
YEAH, WE SHOULD
NEVER LET A WOMAN COME
BETWEEN US AGAIN.

01:17:26.409 --> 01:17:29.645
THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
WE LEARNED A VERY VALUABLE
LESSON HERE, HARRY.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:31.915
- WE'RE NOT EVER
GONNA FORGET THAT.
- YEAH.

01:17:31.915 --> 01:17:34.017
( horn honks )

01:17:34.017 --> 01:17:36.720
EXCUSE US.
YOU'RE HARRY AND LLOYD, RIGHT?

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:40.289
- ACTUALLY, I'M HARRY
AND HE'S LLOYD.
- LLOYD.

01:17:40.289 --> 01:17:42.425
Both:
WELL, WE'RE THE FELCHERS.

01:17:42.425 --> 01:17:44.627
MY NAME'S FREIDA,
AND THIS IS RITA.

01:17:44.627 --> 01:17:47.764
- HI, BOYS.
- Both: HI.

01:17:47.764 --> 01:17:50.566
WE'RE GONNA GO CHECK OUT
THE ALL-GIRLS COLLEGE.

01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:51.868
Both:
DO YOU GUYS WANNA COME?

01:17:51.868 --> 01:17:54.170
- SURE!
- NO, WAIT, HARRY, HARRY!

01:17:54.170 --> 01:17:55.972
JUST A SECOND.
WE'RE JUST GONNA...

01:17:55.972 --> 01:17:59.042
LISTEN, WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT
WHO GETS WHO, ALL RIGHT?
NO MORE COMPETITION.

01:17:59.042 --> 01:18:01.745
- RIGHT.
- OKAY, SO... AHEM.
PICK ONE.

01:18:04.647 --> 01:18:06.682
- THE ONE ON THE LEFT.
- ( sighs )

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:08.952
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- THAT'S THE ONE
THAT I WANTED.

01:18:08.952 --> 01:18:10.754
- NO.
- YEAH.

01:18:10.754 --> 01:18:13.857
- SHE'S ONE OF A KIND.
- ( giggling )

01:18:13.857 --> 01:18:16.259
TRY ONE IN A MILLION.

01:18:16.259 --> 01:18:17.861
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

01:18:17.861 --> 01:18:21.097
- YOU TAKE HER.
- NO, LLOYD, I'M NOT
GOING TO DO THAT TO YOU.

01:18:21.097 --> 01:18:22.899
IT'S OKAY, HARRY,
I'LL FIND SOMEBODY.

01:18:22.899 --> 01:18:25.902
I'M NOT DOING IT.
REMEMBER,

01:18:25.902 --> 01:18:28.104
CHICKS ARE FOR FAGS.

01:18:28.104 --> 01:18:30.206
THAT'S A GOOD ONE, HARRY.

01:18:30.206 --> 01:18:31.841
( pats )

01:18:31.841 --> 01:18:33.342
I'LL HANDLE THIS.

01:18:35.144 --> 01:18:38.114
YEAH.
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD
AND GO ON WITHOUT US?

01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:39.883
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:18:39.883 --> 01:18:43.552
SOMEDAY YOU MIGHT MEET
SOMEBODY AS SPECIAL AS
MY FRIEND HARRY UP THERE,

01:18:43.552 --> 01:18:45.755
BUT I DOUBT IT.

01:18:45.755 --> 01:18:49.058
OH AND UH...
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND OVER THERE,

01:18:49.058 --> 01:18:52.428
SHE'S-- SHE'S NICE TOO.

01:18:54.197 --> 01:18:55.832
- WHAT?!
- ( engine starts )

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:00.303
LOOK OUT, HARRY!

01:19:01.304 --> 01:19:03.339
Lloyd:

01:19:05.341 --> 01:19:07.410

01:19:21.825 --> 01:19:24.360
( groaning )

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:28.998
CHARLIE!

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:32.135
- OH MY GOD.

01:19:32.135 --> 01:19:33.937
IT'S YOU.

01:19:33.937 --> 01:19:36.239

01:22:03.953 --> 01:22:07.490
( bubbles )

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:08.891
OOPSIE-DAISY.

01:22:08.891 --> 01:22:12.962

01:22:12.962 --> 01:22:17.166

01:22:18.001 --> 01:22:20.369
( music playing )

01:22:32.415 --> 01:22:36.052
* HOW MANY WORDS CAN YOU
FIT INSIDE A SUITCASE? *

01:22:36.052 --> 01:22:39.555
* PACKED IT SO TIGHT
THAT YOU COULDN'T SING A TUNE *

01:22:39.555 --> 01:22:43.659
* YOU FELL DOWN THE STAIRS
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T TIE
YOUR BOOTLACE *

01:22:43.659 --> 01:22:47.096
* GIVEN A CHOICE
COULD YOU CHOOSE? *

01:22:47.096 --> 01:22:50.933
* YOU WENT FOR A WALK AND YOU
CAME ACROSS A COOL PLACE *

01:22:50.933 --> 01:22:54.837
* RESTED YOUR HEAD
WITH A VODKA BY THE POOL *

01:22:54.837 --> 01:22:58.541
* YOU WENT FOR A SWIM AND YOU
FOUND THAT YOU WERE SINKING *

01:22:58.541 --> 01:23:02.278
* DON'T YOU KNOW POOLS
ARE FOR FOOLS? *

01:23:02.278 --> 01:23:04.847
* GIVEN THE CHOICE
COULD YOU CHOOSE? *

01:23:04.847 --> 01:23:08.584
* GROOVIN' ALONG
ALL ALONE IN THE PARK *

01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:12.121
* SINGING A SONG 'CAUSE YOU'RE
AFRAID OF THE DARK *

01:23:12.121 --> 01:23:16.125
* RUNNING AWAY FROM A WORLD
THAT CAN'T WALK *

01:23:16.125 --> 01:23:22.165
* SWINGING YOUR HIPS
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK... *

01:23:26.602 --> 01:23:30.339
* SHOWING YOUR GIRL
'BOUT A NATURAL WAY OF LIVING *

01:23:30.339 --> 01:23:34.009
* GOT BIT IN THE ASS
BY A TIGER AT THE ZOO *

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:37.746
* AND WHEN YOU GOT HOME
YOU JUST PASSED OUT
IN THE KITCHEN *

01:23:37.746 --> 01:23:40.749
* NOW YOU GOT NO ONE
TO LOSE *

01:23:40.749 --> 01:23:44.420
* RAN TO THE STORE AND THEY
SOLD YOU ON THE FUTURE *

01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:48.023
* BIT IN YOUR LIP AND YOU
START TO CRACK A SMILE *

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:51.860
* COME UP WITH A PLAN,
BUT THAT DOESN'T
REALLY MATTER *

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:55.764
* WHEN YOU GOT
NO REASON WHY *

01:23:55.764 --> 01:24:00.703
* GIVEN A CHOICE
COULD YOU TRY? *

01:24:00.703 --> 01:24:03.172
