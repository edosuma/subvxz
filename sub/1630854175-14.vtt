we should talk to.

Wait, hold up. We're definitely
working this case?

06:19.212 --> 06:20.914

has money?

-No disrespect to this girl,

06:23.817 --> 06:25.586

we got to find her,

07:28.348 --> 07:30.518
to send over
a full-sized agent.

07:32.052 --> 07:34.154
I understand how worried you
are, but I can assure you

07:34.187 --> 07:35.656
the FBI is doing
everything we can --

07:35.689 --> 07:36.824
Oh, give me a break.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.267
is deputizing
the entire country

07:47.300 --> 07:49.770
to take the law into their own
hands is -- is dangerous.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.371
I don't care.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.040
I'd burn down the world
to bring my daughter back.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.008
Money is the only thing
that motivates.

07:55.042 --> 07:58.011
In fact, I doubt the two of you
get paid very much,

07:58.045 --> 08:00.714
so $10 million
to whoever finds Brie.

08:00.748 --> 08:01.949
-No.
-Even you.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.717
-We're not for sale.
-Right.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.786
But we do expect you
to give us any information

08:05.819 --> 08:07.287
or tips you receive.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.822
Well, expect away.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.691

somewhere else.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.562
You know, one of my main jobs
around here

08:14.595 --> 08:16.129
is to apologize
for my father.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.698
So of course we'll --
we'll share

08:17.731 --> 08:19.132
whatever information we get.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.635
Right.
No, uh, ransom call yet?

08:21.669 --> 08:22.903
No.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.304
And anyone want
to hurt your sister?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.573
No, but there are plenty
of people

08:25.606 --> 08:26.807
that want to take down
our family.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.308
-Like who?
-You name it.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.210
Competitors,
environmental activists,

08:30.243 --> 08:32.412

to swallow up a legacy company

08:32.445 --> 08:33.581
for foreign land rights.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.148
Okay, could you, um --

08:35.182 --> 08:36.650
could you give us
a-a detailed list?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.518
Yeah, of course.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.390
So, Candace, are you ex-wife
number one, two, or three?

08:43.423 --> 08:45.425
Uh, pardon
my probationary agent.

08:45.458 --> 08:47.327
She's clearly still very much
in training

08:47.360 --> 08:50.598
and hasn't gleaned what is
and what isn't appropriate

08:50.631 --> 08:52.833
when addressing
senior personnel.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.836
Okay. She's getting to know
who we are, Carter.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.270
I didn't think it would be
an issue

08:57.304 --> 08:58.839
if we got to know her,
too.

08:58.872 --> 09:02.776

We met as rookies in Tampa.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.277
Ooh!

09:04.311 --> 09:06.847
I bet that Chapter One
was a romance straight

09:06.880 --> 09:08.181

09:08.215 --> 09:09.783
