WEBVTT

00:07.508 --> 00:10.552
I cannot believe that he supports Arsenal.

00:11.386 --> 00:12.888
- I support Tottenham, Nikki!
- Yes.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.557
Jase, I have grasped
the complex nature of the problem.

00:15.641 --> 00:16.642
Why wouldn't he tell me?

00:16.725 --> 00:19.269
Well, because--
'Cause he's a people pleaser.

00:19.353 --> 00:20.646
He probably thought you'd be upset,

00:20.729 --> 00:24.274
which you won't be,
because it is only football.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.651
It doesn't matter what team he likes.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.819
He needs something to share
with other kids.

00:31.657 --> 00:33.992
- Jason!
- It's a big deal, Nikki, okay?

00:34.076 --> 00:35.911
When I was a kid,
my dad took me to Tottenham,

00:35.994 --> 00:37.788
his dad took him,
and I wanted to take Tyler.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.832
Now I've gotta spend the whole day
with flippin' Arsenal fans.

00:40.916 --> 00:44.419
- I know, I know. It's really--
- Okay.

00:44.503 --> 00:46.129
- Sorry. I tried, but I just--
- All right.

00:46.213 --> 00:49.091
I really can't care about it.
And this is me. I care about--

00:51.760 --> 00:54.263
- Everyone.
- Who's that? What? Who is it?

00:54.346 --> 00:55.764
- It's Jen.
- Have you fired her yet?

00:55.848 --> 00:59.101
No! And if I don't
by the end of the week, Terry will.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.562
But it's fine because I have a new plan.

01:01.645 --> 01:04.438
- Oh, yeah? Go on, I'm listening.
- No, I have. Listen, listen.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.149
I'm gonna take her out
for coffee this morning

01:06.233 --> 01:07.860
and inspire her into quitting

01:07.943 --> 01:09.403
by making her realize

01:09.486 --> 01:11.613
that it is the job
that is holding her back.

01:11.697 --> 01:14.700
Okay, yeah. You're a pushover.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.034
No, I am not!

01:16.118 --> 01:18.871
Are you doing Princess's homework
literally right now?

01:19.955 --> 01:20.998
Oi.

01:21.081 --> 01:24.084
Don't let her and her little friends
walk all over you today, all right?

01:24.168 --> 01:27.212
It's easy for you to be strong with her
'cause she hasn't had a dad before, right?

01:27.296 --> 01:29.590
- She's got no one to compare you to.
- I know.

01:29.673 --> 01:31.884
Dad! Can I have Cheerios?

01:31.967 --> 01:34.344
Yeah. Please use a bowl this time!

01:34.428 --> 01:35.554
Okay.

01:36.555 --> 01:38.515
Jase, is that the first time
she's said "Dad"?

01:40.058 --> 01:41.059
Yeah.

01:43.520 --> 01:44.730
Nikki.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.106
Okay, look, she started last week.

01:46.190 --> 01:49.526
But listen to me,
it is only because I am with her more.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.403
It's not a competition.

01:51.486 --> 01:52.779
Oi, you, listen, don't panic

01:52.863 --> 01:54.740
and buy her something expensive
to make her like you

01:54.823 --> 01:56.950
or I don't know,
let her get a tattoo or something,

01:57.034 --> 01:58.076
'cause you know she wants one.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.078
She's nine.
Where am I getting her a tattoo from?

02:00.162 --> 02:01.872
We live in Camden.
I once saw a dog with a tattoo.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.211
- Hey, hey.
- Yeah?

02:07.294 --> 02:08.419
We've got a couple of minutes.

02:08.503 --> 02:10.631
No! They're up. What if they come in?

02:10.714 --> 02:11.715
They're not gonna come in.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.300
Listen, the best thing
about being adopted is

02:13.383 --> 02:15.677
it's possible
that your parents have never had sex.

02:15.761 --> 02:18.013
Okay? Let's not ruin it for them.

02:47.376 --> 02:48.502
What's all this?

02:49.086 --> 02:52.005
Measuring for a new carpet.
Helps sell the place, I think.

02:52.089 --> 02:55.300
- For the people looking round.
- Keep your voice down a bit, will ya?

02:59.137 --> 03:02.015
Jase, he's doing the flat up
so they can charge us more.

03:02.099 --> 03:03.809
You did put that offer in, didn't you?

03:03.892 --> 03:05.644
No, not quite.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.145
- Jase.
- You know what my dad's like.

03:07.229 --> 03:10.148
He's terrible with paperwork.
He can't even fill out a parking permit.

03:10.232 --> 03:12.150
He still puts a fiver
underneath the windscreen wipers.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.069
- I'll call him. It'll be fine.
- Okay.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.197
The foster home sent
the rest of Tyler's stuff.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.366
There's photos in there.
I think we should put them up.

03:20.659 --> 03:23.036
Jase, I think that's a really good sign.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.997
They know we've got
the court hearing in a few weeks.

03:25.080 --> 03:26.999
They wouldn't send his stuff
if they didn't think he--

03:27.082 --> 03:29.543
They've sent his stuff
because they've sent his stuff. That's it.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.503
- All right?
- Okay.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.297
- I've gotta go meet Jen.
- All right, babe.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.424
- Bye.
- Don't be a pushover.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.843
What? Jase, why is that an insult?

03:37.926 --> 03:41.972
Maybe the problem is
with the people pushing us over.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.307
Ring your dad.

03:43.891 --> 03:44.808
Ringing him.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.061
Also, he wants you
to put these up in the kitchen.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.938
Makes it look nicer, he says.

03:50.022 --> 03:51.273
Is there anything else we can do

03:51.356 --> 03:53.108
to help him to sell the place
from under us?

03:53.942 --> 03:55.569
Maybe take the batteries out
the fruit bowl?

03:59.281 --> 04:00.282
Right.

04:11.585 --> 04:12.711
This is fun.

04:12.794 --> 04:15.214
I prefer fun Jen and Nikki
to work Jen and Nikki.

04:15.297 --> 04:17.298
Yeah. Yeah.

04:17.882 --> 04:19.426
So, how is work going, do you think?

04:19.510 --> 04:21.845
Really good, actually.

04:22.930 --> 04:23.931
Great.

04:25.974 --> 04:29.394
And just for fun,
what would you say your strong points are?

04:29.478 --> 04:30.521
You know, if you had to.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.690
I have a face
that suits literally every type of hat.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.237
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.780
Looks so expensive.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.490
Shall I just have the top?

04:41.573 --> 04:43.158
No. It's on me. It's fine.

04:49.373 --> 04:54.419
Do you know, the person that started
this chain now has eight cake shops?

04:54.503 --> 04:56.296
- No way.
- Yes, yes.

04:56.380 --> 04:57.756
And do you know what she said

04:57.840 --> 05:00.342
the most important part
of setting up this business was?

05:00.926 --> 05:02.177
The cakes.

05:02.261 --> 05:03.554
Well, yes, but before that.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.305
- The chairs?
- No, no.

05:05.389 --> 05:06.557
The vision.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.810
You have to envision
the life that you want.

05:09.893 --> 05:12.729
And, Jen, it can be anything.
It can be absolutely anything you want.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.982
Even if it's not
exactly where you are right now.

05:15.065 --> 05:17.442
Isn't that inspiring?

05:19.444 --> 05:23.532
I know what you're trying to do,
and I really appreciate it.

05:25.033 --> 05:28.328
But I don't want a promotion.
I'm happy where I am.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.664
In fact, I'd say I've never been happier.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.583
And my parents are so proud.

05:32.666 --> 05:35.002
I'm finally back in the family newsletter.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.796
Yeah, one of my cousins thought I'd died.

05:39.298 --> 05:42.009
That's great. Great.

05:52.769 --> 05:54.021
Hey, hey.

05:54.104 --> 05:55.397
I've got some postpartum gifts.

05:57.107 --> 05:59.401
I got a new journal.

05:59.484 --> 06:03.322
And I found us
Shelley's <i>Ode to the West Wind</i>.

06:03.405 --> 06:07.242
I feel-- Well, I mean, one assumes
we'll be in a Shelley place.

06:08.160 --> 06:11.288
And I know it's a little bit early, but…

06:14.875 --> 06:16.460
Okay, okay, Scott.

06:17.461 --> 06:18.545
Look.

06:20.422 --> 06:21.256
Yeah.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.344
If you really wanna help me through this…

06:25.427 --> 06:27.137
- Yeah.
-…then there is something I need.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.056
Yeah.

06:29.139 --> 06:32.559
I need you to be less… modern.

06:34.436 --> 06:35.771
Okay.

06:35.854 --> 06:39.900
I need a tap fixer,
not a watery-eyed journaler, you know?

06:39.983 --> 06:43.195
I need B6 supplements
and cavity wall insulation,

06:43.278 --> 06:44.696
not tears on the toilet

06:44.780 --> 06:47.824
'cause everything in the world
suddenly feels connected.

06:48.408 --> 06:51.870
I cannot have you crying
more than the baby.

06:51.954 --> 06:53.247
Yeah, I mean, that's…

06:54.331 --> 07:00.128
You know I'm not an alpha male.
I mean, you knew that when you proposed.

07:00.754 --> 07:03.549
I just don't like all that
"hug it out, I'll be there for you" stuff.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.759
You know, I can cope very well on my own.

07:06.969 --> 07:09.763
And at the scan,
no holding my hand and stroking my hair.

07:09.847 --> 07:11.974
Just get me a coffee,
sit in the waiting room,

07:12.057 --> 07:16.812
and look over the top of your newspaper
every now and then. Like a Victorian.

07:18.689 --> 07:23.068
Because, to be honest,
it feels like you might be a fainter.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.414
That's cute, isn't it?
What do you think of that?

07:37.541 --> 07:39.710
- No.
- No, it's gross, isn't it?

07:45.299 --> 07:46.508
Can I get this?

07:47.926 --> 07:50.012
Well, that's nice, isn't it?

07:51.722 --> 07:53.515
It's quite expensive.

07:53.599 --> 07:55.142
But I really like it.

07:55.225 --> 07:56.602
Yeah, no, I know you do, but--

07:56.685 --> 07:58.312
Please?

08:01.607 --> 08:03.817
No. No, I'm sorry Princess, no. We can't.

08:19.666 --> 08:23.670
That was fun, wasn't it?
Where do you fancy next, girls?

08:24.713 --> 08:26.673
- Hans & Gretel ice cream!
- Yeah! Ice cream!

08:26.757 --> 08:30.469
Oh, no, no, isn't it a little bit
early for a novelty ice cream?

08:31.512 --> 08:33.804
I'll just go get a chair.

08:33.889 --> 08:36.642
Can you sit over there?

08:36.725 --> 08:37.726
- What, there?
- No.

08:37.808 --> 08:38.852
Over there.

08:44.274 --> 08:45.275
Right.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.986
Right, but that's
a different restaurant, isn't it?

08:51.949 --> 08:52.950
Okay.

08:53.492 --> 08:54.826
Yeah, sure.

09:13.428 --> 09:17.099
Oi, I thought I said
no Adam today. Cheeky.

09:17.683 --> 09:19.351
All right, well,
be careful with him, all right?

09:19.434 --> 09:22.521
We don't want anyone
tripping over his cord, do we? No.

09:23.397 --> 09:24.523
Okay. In you go.

09:45.127 --> 09:47.796
Sorry, I'm trying to watch those kids.

09:54.344 --> 09:56.263
Hi. Are you eating here?

09:56.346 --> 09:57.556
Yes, love.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.767
With food from this café? Because I think
this area is customers only.

10:00.851 --> 10:04.062
I've lost my left breast to cancer.
I'll eat where I like.

10:05.189 --> 10:09.401
Don't tut at me, superfood salad.
I'm not your Polish builder.

10:10.903 --> 10:13.113
Come on, boys. So sorry.

10:16.033 --> 10:19.953
My family knew the Krays,
so no one tells me where I can sit.

10:23.707 --> 10:25.292
- I'm Bev.
- Nikki.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.588
- Cute kids.
- Yeah.

10:29.671 --> 10:30.797
So, which one's yours?

10:30.881 --> 10:32.257
None of them, really.

10:34.426 --> 10:36.094
It's a long story, Bev.

10:38.472 --> 10:40.140
Thanks for coming, mate.

10:40.224 --> 10:43.852
Bat-Signal goes up and here I am.
Can only stay for the first half though.

10:44.394 --> 10:47.064
This just feels so wrong.
It feels so wrong.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.776
I shouldn't be here. They know.
They know that I don't belong here.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.569
It's like when I'm in a church, you know.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.072
Well, he's young. Switch him to Spurs.

10:57.866 --> 10:59.993
I've tried and it's too late.
He's already set.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.954
And anyway,
I'd rather he was an Arsenal fan

11:02.037 --> 11:03.288
than someone who switches teams.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.290
I mean,
that's like… cheating on your wife.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.125
Sorry, mate. No offense.

11:07.209 --> 11:08.627
No, it's fine. I was having a breakdown.

11:08.710 --> 11:10.754
I love it.
I love how you say that like you--

11:10.838 --> 11:13.590
It's like you declare yourself bankrupt
and it just clears all your debt.

11:13.674 --> 11:17.636
- No, look, I know I'm a bad person.
- Right.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.013
- But it's because of what happened to me.
- What do you mean?

11:20.097 --> 11:21.098
Nothing.

11:22.015 --> 11:23.934
Nothing bad has ever happened to me.

11:24.017 --> 11:26.436
Oh, my goodness, mate.
I'm so sorry. You should've said.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.105
When did this not happen?

11:28.188 --> 11:30.899
No. Nothing bad happening
can be ruinous to a person.

11:30.983 --> 11:32.484
- I went to this AA group.
- Yeah?

11:32.568 --> 11:36.280
Everybody there, they had reasons
for their mistakes, but I haven't got any.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.157
I'm just an arsehole.

11:40.534 --> 11:41.618
Feel free to interrupt.

11:43.745 --> 11:45.497
- No, go on.
- Well, there you go.

11:47.082 --> 11:50.794
So… I started this.

11:51.879 --> 11:53.964
- AA.
- Arseholes Anonymous.

11:54.047 --> 11:58.802
I have created a safe space
for arseholes to come together and change.

11:58.886 --> 11:59.887
- Right.
-'Cause you see,

11:59.970 --> 12:02.097
I've got a lot of good things in my life
that I don't deserve,

12:02.181 --> 12:03.557
and I'm gonna start deserving them.

12:04.558 --> 12:07.728
Yesterday I considered
letting a refugee stay in my spare room.

12:07.811 --> 12:09.396
I mean, practically, it wouldn't work.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.648
The kitchen island's tiny,
and I imagine it's a lot of forms.

12:11.732 --> 12:13.442
- But I'm telling you…
- Sure.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.861
…I'm gonna change people.

12:15.944 --> 12:20.407
The man you are today need not be
the man you are tomorrow.

12:21.533 --> 12:22.576
Are you running a cult?

12:23.368 --> 12:26.538
- Time will tell, mate. Time will tell.
-<i>Lacazette. Lacazette!</i>

12:40.719 --> 12:41.845
Shit.

12:41.929 --> 12:43.472
So we go in front of a judge

12:43.555 --> 12:46.308
and just hope
that they give us full custody,

12:46.391 --> 12:49.394
but we just-- We're not sure
which way it's gonna go at the minute.

12:49.478 --> 12:50.479
No?

12:51.855 --> 12:55.317
I don't think that I've got
the relationship with Princess

12:55.400 --> 12:56.985
that I would've hoped to have had by now.

12:57.778 --> 13:00.864
I just-- I feel like
just some random woman in her life.

13:00.948 --> 13:03.408
I think that's why I find it hard
to be tough with her.

13:03.492 --> 13:06.078
I'm so desperate for her to like me.

13:06.870 --> 13:08.956
Yeah, my daughter had some problems,

13:09.039 --> 13:12.417
and I'm telling you,
tough love is the only love.

13:12.501 --> 13:14.920
Yeah, yeah. You're right, you're right.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.339
- Family is everything.
- Yeah.

13:17.422 --> 13:18.966
Look, if someone tried to take mine away?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.802
There'd be murders.

13:23.929 --> 13:25.180
Literal murders.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.728
- Sorry, I'm just gonna keep--
- No, you keep an eye, love.

13:32.229 --> 13:35.065
If I was going to grab a kid,
I'd do it here.

13:35.566 --> 13:36.775
Yeah.

13:42.114 --> 13:43.782
Sorry, I just need to--

13:44.366 --> 13:45.284
- Hello?
-<i>Hi.</i>

13:45.367 --> 13:47.119
Promise me you won't panic.
He's fine, okay?

13:47.202 --> 13:48.203
Jase, what's happened?

13:48.287 --> 13:49.746
He's tripped over and banged his head,

13:49.830 --> 13:51.748
so I brought him to hospital
just to be on the safe side.

13:51.832 --> 13:52.916
Hospital?

13:53.000 --> 13:55.002
<i>Yeah, look, he's-- Trust me, he's okay.</i>

13:55.085 --> 13:57.004
In the taxi,
he was more concerned with the football.

13:57.087 --> 13:58.213
Weren't you, mate?

13:58.297 --> 13:59.798
Jase, sorry. Why are you in a taxi?

13:59.882 --> 14:00.924
'Cause I've had a drink.

14:01.008 --> 14:02.467
You're drunk?

14:06.263 --> 14:08.557
Jase, what if they call social services?

14:08.640 --> 14:11.685
We're gonna be in and out,
and no one's calling anyone, all right?

14:11.768 --> 14:14.271
Listen-- Look, I've gotta go,
babe, all right?

14:14.354 --> 14:15.606
No--

14:17.274 --> 14:18.400
Bloody hell.

14:19.735 --> 14:21.737
- Everything all right?
- Sorry, yeah. I just--

14:21.820 --> 14:25.199
Gotta go. It's fine, it's totally fine.

14:26.158 --> 14:28.493
- It was so nice to meet you, Bev.
- Yeah, you too.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.579
And be strong, eh?

14:30.662 --> 14:32.748
Kids need a strong woman in their lives.

14:32.831 --> 14:33.832
Yes.

14:35.334 --> 14:38.962
Okay, Princess, we need to go.
Your brother's had a little accident.

14:54.228 --> 14:56.355
Okay.
There's a small bruise there, isn't there?

14:56.438 --> 14:57.773
Well, he tripped over Adam.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.858
Didn't-- Well, that's his lamp.

15:00.901 --> 15:03.904
- Okay. It looks fine.
- Yeah?

15:03.987 --> 15:06.114
I'd like to give it half an hour
to make sure.

15:06.198 --> 15:08.116
- Great, so should we wait here?
- Wait here.

15:08.200 --> 15:10.077
All right. Fantastic. Thank you, Doctor.

15:17.334 --> 15:21.630
Hi. Hi, welcome back. Hi. Hi, come on in.

15:22.381 --> 15:25.676
Welcome, welcome.
Welcome. Take a seat.

15:28.011 --> 15:31.431
So, welcome to the other AA.

15:31.515 --> 15:35.269
Before we start,
I see that once again I'm the only person

15:35.352 --> 15:36.812
to bring biscuits.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.273
Now, didn't mind doing it
for the first few sessions,

15:39.356 --> 15:42.484
but we are entering
freeloader territory here,

15:42.568 --> 15:46.488
so let's not forget why we're here. Okay?

15:47.823 --> 15:50.367
Now, well, I see we have a new member.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.579
So, would you like
to start by introducing yourself?

15:55.038 --> 15:56.456
Yeah…

15:57.332 --> 16:01.336
I'm Lawrence, and I'm an arsehole.

16:03.589 --> 16:05.465
And we all say hello back.

16:06.175 --> 16:07.926
We spoke about this last week.
Come on, guys.

16:08.010 --> 16:09.344
- Hello, Lawrence.
- Hi, Lawrence.

16:09.428 --> 16:10.679
- Hello, Lawrence.
- Hi, Lawrence.

16:16.935 --> 16:18.770
Your bag's open.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.484
Why do you have this?

16:26.111 --> 16:27.821
Princess, why do you have this?

16:34.578 --> 16:36.038
Right. Okay, come on, we're going back.

16:36.121 --> 16:37.998
- No!
- No! No argument.

16:38.081 --> 16:39.291
Please!

16:39.374 --> 16:41.335
<i>Has to be their last chance, you'd think.</i>

16:41.418 --> 16:44.129
<i>And Spurs
continue to throw for the leveler.</i>

16:44.213 --> 16:48.383
<i>Looking for Dier. Here is Dier.
And Moura at the far post.</i>

16:48.467 --> 16:51.136
<i>Yes, and it's Lucas Moura.</i>

16:51.220 --> 16:54.389
<i>Tottenham rescue the point. It's 1-1…</i>

16:54.473 --> 16:58.101
Are you okay, mate?
It's only football.

16:58.185 --> 17:00.812
<i>And it's Tottenham 1, Arsenal 1.</i>

17:03.065 --> 17:05.317
And I just lost it, you know.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.319
And I stood up,
I pushed him against the wall

17:07.402 --> 17:10.446
and I'm screaming in his face,
"You call this an Admiral's Club?"

17:14.451 --> 17:17.829
So, I'm thinking of volunteering
in a soup kitchen.

17:17.913 --> 17:19.957
I mean, it seems like a good thing to do.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.376
Plus, they don't really expect much,
so, you know.

17:22.459 --> 17:23.794
That's very brave.

17:24.752 --> 17:26.922
Olivia, is there something
you'd like to contribute?

17:27.005 --> 17:29.716
Sounds like a bad Admiral's Club.
I'd have shoved the guy.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.385
Yes, but then where would that get us?

17:31.468 --> 17:34.972
Well, eventually, better Admiral's clubs.
I mean, what are we doing here?

17:35.055 --> 17:36.557
We're trying to become better people.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.767
Why? We're already the best ones.

17:38.851 --> 17:43.605
- We're not soup kitchen volunteers. We're…
- Lawyer.

17:43.689 --> 17:46.108
- You?
- Small tech start-up.

17:46.191 --> 17:49.528
Early days, but we expect to float
in the third quarter of next year.

17:50.028 --> 17:50.946
CEO.

17:51.029 --> 17:52.698
- Yeah, I'm a surgeon.
- You?

17:52.781 --> 17:54.575
Director of my own sporting goods company.

17:54.658 --> 17:57.452
Exactly. Arseholes run things.

17:57.536 --> 17:59.580
Because running things is hard,

17:59.663 --> 18:01.665
and we're the only ones
with the stomach for it.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.959
Yes, but that doesn't give us license
to behave badly.

18:04.042 --> 18:07.546
-'Cause we live in a society.
- Who cares about society?

18:07.629 --> 18:09.006
Ants have a great society.

18:09.089 --> 18:12.467
They still vomit into each other's mouths
to communicate.

18:12.551 --> 18:15.179
If ants had egos,
they'd have smartphones by now.

18:15.262 --> 18:17.723
Well, hard to do anything
other than speculate about that.

18:17.806 --> 18:22.728
Human progress happens
when arseholes act like arseholes.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.397
What human progress did me cheating
on my wife achieve?

18:25.480 --> 18:28.192
Yours. Your human progress.
You were probably miserable.

18:28.275 --> 18:31.945
- No, see, 'cause I'm miserable now.
- Well, that's because you're here.

18:32.029 --> 18:32.946
No, I'm sorry.

18:33.030 --> 18:35.866
I tried, but I can't do this.

18:35.949 --> 18:37.784
I'm quitting my job at Oxfam.

18:37.868 --> 18:40.204
It hasn't made me happier
like you said it would.

18:40.704 --> 18:43.081
You can't run away from your true nature

18:43.165 --> 18:48.337
like it's jury service or a cyclist
you just glance with your car.

18:50.297 --> 18:53.800
Olivia, I'm sorry, but I'm gonna need
your two-week chip back.

18:53.884 --> 18:56.220
Fine. I was going anyway.

19:00.891 --> 19:02.434
You all should too.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.943
Jonathan. Leonard. Come on.

19:12.486 --> 19:13.987
Guys, seriously.

19:15.614 --> 19:19.243
I mean, Dan, you were doing so well.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.496
Guys?

19:27.835 --> 19:29.044
Lawrence.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.888
A little cold. But this just helps
the ultrasound waves go in

19:39.972 --> 19:42.015
and gives us a clearer picture.

19:42.099 --> 19:45.143
And this is the probe we're going to use.
It is a round probe and--

19:45.227 --> 19:46.353
Okay, okay.

19:47.729 --> 19:52.401
Vanessa, I'm very comfortable
with the edited highlights of this. Okay?

19:53.235 --> 19:54.319
Okay.

20:06.790 --> 20:08.750
Just trying to see
if I can find a heartbeat.

20:08.834 --> 20:11.503
- Can be a little tricky sometimes.
- Okay.

20:14.590 --> 20:16.633
I'm just gonna try a little bit more gel.

20:17.467 --> 20:20.470
Sometimes people are a bit off
with the dates,

20:20.554 --> 20:23.932
so they think they're further along
than they are. Which might explain it.

20:24.016 --> 20:26.310
- When was your last period?
- No, the dates--

20:27.477 --> 20:29.271
I know they're right.

20:30.314 --> 20:31.231
Okay.

20:46.663 --> 20:50.083
Okay, you know what,
I'm just gonna pop and get a colleague.

20:50.167 --> 20:52.336
- Okay.
- Okay. I won't be a moment.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.715
Vanessa?

20:59.301 --> 21:00.469
Can you do me a favor?

21:19.738 --> 21:21.073
Scott?

21:32.125 --> 21:33.877
I'll just be two minutes.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.132
Okay, okay.

21:39.216 --> 21:43.804
It's okay. I've got you.
Both of you. Okay?

21:44.888 --> 21:46.932
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.475
You're fine. Keep an eye.

21:48.559 --> 21:49.726
All right, fantastic.

21:49.810 --> 21:51.937
Right, then, you, let's go.

21:52.688 --> 21:53.981
Good boy.

21:54.064 --> 21:56.275
<i>Looking for Lacazette with Saka in space.</i>

21:56.358 --> 22:01.655
Yes! We won! We won, Dad! We won!

22:01.738 --> 22:03.365
<i>Arsenal steal it at the death.</i>

22:03.949 --> 22:06.285
<i>We love you, Arsenal
We do</i>

22:06.368 --> 22:07.578
Sing with me, Dad.

22:07.661 --> 22:09.997
<i>We love you, Arsenal, we do</i>

22:10.080 --> 22:15.794
<i>We love you, Arsenal, we do
We love you, Arsenal, we do</i>

22:15.878 --> 22:20.424
<i>We love you, Arsenal, we do
Oh, Arsenal, we love you</i>

22:20.507 --> 22:23.468
<i>We love you, Arsenal, we do</i>

22:40.903 --> 22:42.154
There we go.

22:43.864 --> 22:45.699
Little bit shy, that's all.

22:46.450 --> 22:47.993
Make the most of that.

23:13.143 --> 23:14.436
Princess?

23:15.103 --> 23:16.647
No, Princess.

23:17.147 --> 23:18.440
Princess?

23:20.150 --> 23:21.902
Princess, will you let me in, please?

23:21.985 --> 23:24.696
- No.
- I have to do tough love.

23:24.780 --> 23:25.781
Why?

23:25.864 --> 23:28.242
I don't know.
People just always say it, don't they?

23:28.325 --> 23:29.701
So I think it must be true.

23:30.369 --> 23:32.496
- Just come out.
- No.

23:35.374 --> 23:37.334
Sorry. Sorry, sorry.

23:39.753 --> 23:42.005
- Oi.
- Go away.

23:42.089 --> 23:43.632
- Princess.
- Go away!

23:43.715 --> 23:45.551
Will you just tell me why you took it?

23:46.802 --> 23:48.846
Excuse me. Is there a problem?

23:48.929 --> 23:50.973
Yes. Yes, actually,
these walls are too high.

23:51.056 --> 23:52.432
Please don't look over the walls.

23:52.516 --> 23:54.810
This is a private matter, actually.
Thank you very much.

23:54.893 --> 23:57.229
- I have jurisdiction in the whole shop.
- Please!

23:57.312 --> 24:00.107
You're not even allowed to stop
shoplifters walking out with stuff.

24:00.190 --> 24:01.733
It's health and safety.

24:01.817 --> 24:04.528
I've read that.
You're basically a scarecrow.

24:06.488 --> 24:10.450
I can ask them to stop, actually.

24:10.534 --> 24:12.870
No, okay, I'm sorry, that was mean.
That was mean.

24:12.953 --> 24:14.329
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

24:31.680 --> 24:33.473
We don't have to do tough love.

24:34.933 --> 24:36.393
Things are tough enough.

24:41.106 --> 24:42.733
Will you come out?

25:05.255 --> 25:06.673
Why did you take it?

25:10.219 --> 25:11.845
Your birthmark?

25:15.265 --> 25:16.558
They made fun of it.

25:18.977 --> 25:21.730
Well, it just makes you
a little different, that's all.

25:21.813 --> 25:23.524
I don't want to be different.

25:24.942 --> 25:25.943
Yeah, I get it.

25:26.985 --> 25:27.861
I get it.

25:28.362 --> 25:30.906
When you're young, you want to cover up

25:31.406 --> 25:33.075
what's different about you.

25:34.660 --> 25:36.286
When you get older,

25:36.995 --> 25:39.623
it becomes the thing
that people like about you.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.382
Right. You don't want to be different?

25:48.465 --> 25:51.343
No? I know what we can do.

26:10.863 --> 26:12.281
Let's have a look at yours.

26:20.998 --> 26:21.915
You are insane.

26:21.999 --> 26:23.834
You know, I've always wanted a tattoo.

26:24.877 --> 26:26.587
I feel so edgy.

26:27.171 --> 26:29.131
But I still want to be
taken seriously at work,

26:29.214 --> 26:32.467
so I'm gonna put a watch over it
to cover it when I'm in client meetings.

26:32.551 --> 26:33.844
So edgy, yeah.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.388
Do you know, we had a moment.

26:36.471 --> 26:37.472
Yeah?

26:37.556 --> 26:39.683
What, did you gaze
into each other's eyes?

26:39.766 --> 26:41.018
- Yes. Yes.
- You did?

26:41.101 --> 26:44.897
Well, no. I mean, she looked in a mirror.
But I saw, Jase.

26:55.616 --> 26:57.993
We still need to unpack his stuff.

27:04.875 --> 27:07.586
Jase, look.

27:08.170 --> 27:09.046
Yeah.

27:09.546 --> 27:11.465
- I'm gonna put these up for them.
- Hold on a sec.

27:14.092 --> 27:15.511
- Can I have that?
- Yeah.

28:10.065 --> 28:11.775
<i>Unscrew the nut to release the…</i>

28:40.554 --> 28:41.555
Bev!
