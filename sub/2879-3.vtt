WEBVTT

00:02.398 --> 00:04.065
<i>Hey, Bernie.</i>

00:04.067 --> 00:06.951
Hey, how's my little
astronautie hottie?

00:06.953 --> 00:08.386
Okay, I guess.

00:08.388 --> 00:11.122
It's just,
being cooped up in this...

00:11.124 --> 00:13.541
tin can for weeks on end
is starting to get to me.

00:13.543 --> 00:15.210
Well, hang in there.
You just have a couple more

00:15.212 --> 00:16.561
days to go,
and then you'll be home.

00:16.563 --> 00:18.947
I know.

00:18.949 --> 00:20.031
I got to get back to work.

00:20.033 --> 00:21.032
I love you.

00:21.034 --> 00:22.033
Love you too.

00:22.035 --> 00:23.134
Hey, Bernie?

00:23.136 --> 00:27.088
Before you go, can you
do something for me?

00:27.090 --> 00:28.540
What do you want me to do?

00:28.542 --> 00:31.226
Okay, here it is.

00:31.228 --> 00:34.545
I really miss gravity.

00:34.547 --> 00:39.351
Can you drop something
so I can watch it fall?

00:40.836 --> 00:43.221
Really, you're serious?

00:46.308 --> 00:49.978
Okay.

00:49.980 --> 00:53.865
Oh, baby, you're killing me.

00:56.018 --> 00:57.735
Ugh.

00:57.737 --> 00:58.703
Hey, Sheldon?

00:58.705 --> 01:00.004
Hi. This came
for you today.

01:00.006 --> 01:00.955
It's from your mom.

01:00.957 --> 01:02.424
Oh!

01:02.426 --> 01:04.175
Thank you, Penny.
Mm-hmm.

01:04.177 --> 01:06.044
Yeah, w... here.

01:08.314 --> 01:10.014
For your troubles.

01:10.016 --> 01:13.218
Oh, boy, a whole dollar.

01:13.220 --> 01:15.186
Now, I can quit my paper route.

01:16.472 --> 01:17.839
So, what's in it?

01:17.841 --> 01:19.124
Mmm, doesn't matter.

01:19.126 --> 01:22.026
Half the time, he just ends up
playing with the box.

01:22.028 --> 01:25.596
Yeah, it's journals and research
papers I wrote as a child.

01:25.598 --> 01:27.949
Aw, how cute.

01:27.951 --> 01:29.300
Is this like a diary?

01:29.302 --> 01:32.053
No, that's my
potty training journal.

01:32.055 --> 01:34.489
Really, your
potty training journal?

01:34.491 --> 01:35.540
Yeah.

01:35.542 --> 01:37.242
And forgive my crude penmanship.

01:37.244 --> 01:39.777
I didn't start typing
until I was six.

01:42.047 --> 01:45.383
"August 7, 8:42 a.m.
This is humiliating.

01:45.385 --> 01:46.951
What was wrong with diapers?"

01:48.972 --> 01:51.055
There are some charts
in the back

01:51.057 --> 01:52.724
where I kept track
of shape, color

01:52.726 --> 01:54.959
and consistency.
Oh!

01:55.711 --> 01:57.479
Disgusting.

01:57.481 --> 02:01.299
No, what's disgusting
is he's still keeping track.

02:02.101 --> 02:03.518
Why do you need
all this stuff...?

02:03.520 --> 02:04.652
No, no, no, no...
Sorry!

02:04.654 --> 02:05.904
I am glad you asked.

02:05.906 --> 02:07.021
Oh!

02:07.023 --> 02:10.358
Yeah, are you familiar
with the Higgs boson?

02:10.360 --> 02:13.328
Of course, it is...
it's been in the news.

02:13.330 --> 02:16.281
And it's a very famous boson.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.700
Nice try.

02:18.702 --> 02:21.369
Now, in 1964, Dr. Peter Higgs,

02:21.371 --> 02:23.371
accomplished self-promoter
and physicist,

02:23.373 --> 02:26.291
he wrote a paper
postulating the existence

02:26.293 --> 02:28.826
of a subatomic particle
called the Higgs boson.

02:28.828 --> 02:30.261
Now, initially,

02:30.263 --> 02:34.132
the paper was rejected, but
recently, he was proven right.

02:34.134 --> 02:36.851
And now he's on the fast
track to win a Nobel prize.

02:36.853 --> 02:40.021
Yeah, that's basically what I said.
Yeah...

02:40.023 --> 02:44.675
The point is Higgs
is being celebrated for work

02:44.677 --> 02:46.644
he did 50 years ago, so that

02:46.646 --> 02:49.013
got me thinking,
perhaps I've already hit

02:49.015 --> 02:52.033
upon the idea
that will win me my Nobel prize.

02:52.035 --> 02:53.985
I didn't know
they gave Nobel prizes

02:53.987 --> 02:56.187
for making boom-boom
in the potty.

02:57.373 --> 02:59.023
You really think

02:59.025 --> 03:01.960
there's some kind
of scientific discovery in here?

03:01.962 --> 03:04.462
Well, this box only covers
my work through nursery school.

03:04.464 --> 03:06.080
There's a good deal
more to come.

03:06.082 --> 03:09.200
I didn't really hit my academic
stride until I cut out

03:09.202 --> 03:11.886
that time-suck
known as "playing outdoors."

03:11.888 --> 03:13.838
So, you're going to spend

03:13.840 --> 03:15.540
hours and hours combing
through all this stuff?

03:15.542 --> 03:17.675
That's a good point.

03:17.677 --> 03:19.594
My time is much too valuable.

03:19.596 --> 03:22.096
You know, perhaps I should
find someone to do it for me.

03:22.098 --> 03:23.815
You know, someone with
a rudimentary understanding

03:23.817 --> 03:28.069
of science, but whose real
talents lie in menial labor.

03:32.791 --> 03:34.692
Not gonna happen.

03:34.694 --> 03:37.111
Yeah, well, if I didn't
think you could handle it,

03:37.113 --> 03:38.496
I wouldn't be asking.

03:38.498 --> 03:41.399
If you want help,
just hire a grad student.

03:41.401 --> 03:42.567
Maybe I could do it.

03:42.569 --> 03:45.253
You, really?

03:45.255 --> 03:48.006
You can assess
the quality of my work?

03:48.008 --> 03:49.507
Okay, um, here.

03:49.509 --> 03:51.626
I wrote this
when I was five years old.

03:51.628 --> 03:56.080
"A proof that algebraic topology
can never have a non-self

03:56.082 --> 03:59.183
contradictory set
of abelion groups."

04:03.122 --> 04:06.090
I'm just a blonde monkey
to you, aren't I?

04:10.312 --> 04:12.730

04:41.807 --> 04:44.809
All right, Ms. Jenson.

04:44.811 --> 04:47.645
Uh, before we begin,
may I offer you a refreshment?

04:47.647 --> 04:49.981
Water, coffee, tea,

04:49.983 --> 04:52.150
a marijuana cigarette?

04:53.019 --> 04:54.469
No, thanks. I'm fine.

04:54.471 --> 04:56.004
Now, are you sure?

04:56.006 --> 04:59.107
Everyone's smoking them.

04:59.109 --> 05:01.543
I think they're the best.

05:01.545 --> 05:02.928
I don't do drugs.

05:02.930 --> 05:04.546
Excellent, yeah.

05:04.548 --> 05:05.830
That was a ruse.

05:05.832 --> 05:07.332
They're not the best.

05:07.334 --> 05:09.167
Physics is the best.

05:09.169 --> 05:10.502
And by the way,

05:10.504 --> 05:13.004
coffee was also
an unacceptable choice.

05:13.006 --> 05:16.725
All right, so I see here
you're from Des Moines, Iowa.

05:16.727 --> 05:19.311
Uh, you're summa cum laude
in theoretical physics

05:19.313 --> 05:20.679
from Stanford University.

05:20.681 --> 05:25.684
Oh, and two years ago, you had
a persistent ear infection.

05:25.686 --> 05:27.953
I hope that didn't
cause any hearing loss.

05:27.955 --> 05:29.754
No, of course not.

05:29.756 --> 05:31.239
How did you know about that?

05:31.241 --> 05:33.908
I did a comprehensive
background check.

05:33.910 --> 05:37.629
Medical records, credit reports,
criminal history.

05:37.631 --> 05:40.615
I trust you paid off
those parking tickets.

05:40.617 --> 05:42.033
Yes, I did.

05:42.035 --> 05:45.203
Hearing unimpaired, good.

05:45.205 --> 05:48.139
Look, Dr. Cooper,
I really want this position.

05:48.141 --> 05:50.008
It would be
an incredible honor to work

05:50.010 --> 05:51.593
for a man of your brilliance.

05:51.595 --> 05:55.213
Flattery will not get you
this job, Ms. Jenson.

05:55.215 --> 05:57.682
It's not flattery
if it's the truth.

05:57.684 --> 06:00.018
Oh, well, thank you.

06:00.020 --> 06:01.486
Welcome aboard.

06:03.139 --> 06:05.023
You talk to Howard lately?

06:05.025 --> 06:06.107
Uh, yeah, last night.

06:06.109 --> 06:09.494
He kept making me
drop pencils for him.

06:11.280 --> 06:13.415
I got uncomfortable.

06:13.417 --> 06:14.732
Hey, Sheldon,
hope you're hungry.

06:14.734 --> 06:16.618
They're serving
macaroni and...

06:16.620 --> 06:19.120
cheese.

06:21.307 --> 06:23.508
Smooth.

06:25.511 --> 06:26.845
Hi.

06:26.847 --> 06:27.929
Hello.

06:27.931 --> 06:29.681
Sheldon, aren't you
going to introduce us?

06:29.683 --> 06:31.800
No. I have people
for that now.

06:31.802 --> 06:33.468
You're up.

06:33.470 --> 06:35.586
I'm Alex,
Dr. Cooper's new assistant.

06:35.588 --> 06:38.256
Ah, congratulations and may God
have mercy on your soul.

06:39.925 --> 06:41.259
I'm Leonard. This is Raj.

06:41.261 --> 06:42.560
It's nice to meet you.

06:42.562 --> 06:44.112
I'm so excited
to be working with Dr...

06:44.114 --> 06:45.113
Yeah, please reserve

06:45.115 --> 06:47.065
chitchat for your breaks,
Ms. Jenson.

06:47.067 --> 06:49.984
Yeah, FYI,
there will be no breaks.

06:51.320 --> 06:54.239
I should probably get to work.

06:56.158 --> 06:57.325
She seems nice.

06:57.327 --> 06:58.576
Hey, you already
got a girlfriend.

06:58.578 --> 07:00.278
I call dibs.

07:00.280 --> 07:03.064
All I said was,
"She seems nice."

07:03.066 --> 07:04.949
Yeah, well, I love her.

07:12.475 --> 07:14.826
Hey, I wasn't expecting
to hear from you today.

07:14.828 --> 07:16.010
Everything okay?

07:16.012 --> 07:18.730
Uh, no, not really.

07:19.882 --> 07:21.533
What's wrong?

07:21.535 --> 07:23.435
Well, remember the...
Soyuz capsule

07:23.437 --> 07:25.253
they were sending
to bring us home?

07:25.255 --> 07:26.221
Uh-huh.

07:26.223 --> 07:27.489
It's delayed.

07:27.491 --> 07:29.307
We're gonna be here
at least another week.

07:29.309 --> 07:30.608
Maybe ten days.

07:30.610 --> 07:33.411
It's the Russians,
so you don't know.

07:35.498 --> 07:38.700
They left dogs up here
in the '60s.

07:40.653 --> 07:42.203
Come on, Howard.

07:42.205 --> 07:44.289
No one's leaving you up there.

07:44.291 --> 07:46.541
I don't know how much longer
I can take this.

07:46.543 --> 07:50.428
I can't sleep, and zero gravity
is giving me crazy acid reflux.

07:51.465 --> 07:54.215
I'm down to my last three Tums.

07:55.501 --> 07:57.302
You're going to be fine.

07:57.304 --> 07:59.938
You survived that Weight
Watchers cruise with your mom.

08:01.624 --> 08:04.809
And they ran out
of low-fat ice cream on day two.

08:06.245 --> 08:09.347
Just calm down and take
a few deep breaths.

08:09.349 --> 08:10.815
Okay, okay.

08:14.037 --> 08:17.322
What am I doing?
I'm using up all the oxygen.

08:20.743 --> 08:25.113
If I die, promise you'll never
have sex with another man.

08:30.319 --> 08:32.921
Oh, yeah.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.642
I'm a man-eater now.

08:37.644 --> 08:41.763
Okay, for the final touch,
this is an eyelash curler.

08:41.765 --> 08:45.517
You just place it on your lashes
and squeeze it closed.

08:45.519 --> 08:48.069
Oh, I don't know.

08:48.071 --> 08:50.855
Looks like something used
by Tinker Bell's gynecologist.

08:53.859 --> 08:57.061
Who I hope for her sake
is not Captain Hook, so...

09:02.067 --> 09:03.201
Who are you calling?

09:03.203 --> 09:04.669
I'm going to
video-chat Sheldon.

09:04.671 --> 09:05.587
Mmm.

09:05.589 --> 09:07.038
If my new look
leads to phone sex,

09:07.040 --> 09:09.157
I'm going to have to ask you
to leave the room.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.827
Dr. Cooper's office.

09:12.829 --> 09:14.762
Oh, hello. Who are you?

09:14.764 --> 09:17.031
I'm Alex,
Dr. Cooper's assistant.

09:17.033 --> 09:17.999
Can I help you?

09:18.001 --> 09:19.450
I'd like to speak to Sheldon.

09:19.452 --> 09:21.953
I'm sorry. He's asked me
to hold all calls

09:21.955 --> 09:24.255
unless you're Stephen Hawking,
his mother

09:24.257 --> 09:26.591
or himself from the future.

09:27.426 --> 09:28.693
All right.

09:28.695 --> 09:30.528
Well, tell him Amy called.
Last name?

09:30.530 --> 09:31.929
He knows my last name.

09:31.931 --> 09:33.598
I'm his girlfriend.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.533
We have a contract
and everything.

09:35.535 --> 09:37.785
I'll send you a PDF.

09:38.654 --> 09:41.539
All right, I will
tell him you called.

09:43.542 --> 09:45.660
Hmm, that's weird.
What?

09:45.662 --> 09:49.113
Sheldon told me he had
a new assistant named Alex.

09:49.115 --> 09:51.366
He didn't mention
that Alex was a girl.

09:51.368 --> 09:53.868
Maybe he didn't notice.

09:53.870 --> 09:55.136
You're right.

09:55.138 --> 09:56.754
I don't have to worry
about Sheldon.

09:56.756 --> 09:59.474
No, you do not.

10:00.726 --> 10:03.328
It's her I have to worry about.

10:03.330 --> 10:04.846
Oh, Amy, really?

10:04.848 --> 10:06.881
She is not going to come on
to Sheldon.

10:06.883 --> 10:08.266
Oh, really?

10:08.268 --> 10:10.685
Look at this face.

10:13.055 --> 10:15.573
How can any woman
spend eight hours a day

10:15.575 --> 10:19.060
alone with this face
and not fall in love with it?

10:19.062 --> 10:21.062
Well, for starters,

10:21.064 --> 10:24.198
at some point,
that face starts talking.

10:32.590 --> 10:34.006
Amy, this is crazy.

10:34.008 --> 10:35.874
You have nothing
to be suspicious about.

10:35.876 --> 10:37.092
I'm not suspicious.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.545
I just want to stop in,
say hi to my boyfriend

10:39.547 --> 10:40.963
and meet his new assistant.

10:40.965 --> 10:43.932
Aha!

10:47.420 --> 10:48.837
Can we go now?

10:48.839 --> 10:50.005
Hang on.

10:56.896 --> 10:57.913
What are you doing?

10:57.915 --> 10:59.448
Isn't it obvious?

10:59.450 --> 11:02.818
I'm spreading my scent
to mark my territory.

11:04.070 --> 11:07.239
Come on, Amy.
That is not gonna work.

11:07.241 --> 11:10.409
Really? Because just before you
became my best friend,

11:10.411 --> 11:13.412
I did this
all over your apartment.

11:18.051 --> 11:20.452
Has your, uh, assistant
said anything about me?

11:20.454 --> 11:22.170
In fact, she has.

11:22.172 --> 11:26.608
Uh, her exact words were,
"What is that guy's problem?"

11:27.427 --> 11:30.762
I'm in her head.
Let the dance begin.

11:33.466 --> 11:35.484
Here's your frozen yogurt,
Dr. Cooper.

11:35.486 --> 11:36.818
This should be fun.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.553
Half chocolate,
half vanilla,

11:38.555 --> 11:40.439
side by side, not swirled?
Yes.

11:40.441 --> 11:42.407
Half a teaspoon of sprinkles?
Rainbow, not chocolate.

11:42.409 --> 11:44.226
Two cherries?
One on top, one on the bottom.

11:44.228 --> 11:46.194
Stems removed?
Um...

11:46.196 --> 11:47.412
top one, yes.

11:47.414 --> 11:49.097
I didn't check the one
on the bottom.

11:49.099 --> 11:51.199
Oh...!

11:52.902 --> 11:54.820
I'm so sorry, Dr. Cooper.

11:54.822 --> 11:56.171
It's all right, Alex.

11:56.173 --> 11:58.974
I'm not mad at you;
I'm just disappointed.

12:00.793 --> 12:02.361
Wait, Alex.
Do you want to join us?

12:02.363 --> 12:03.378
Um...

12:03.380 --> 12:04.713
Uh, Alex, a moment.

12:04.715 --> 12:07.749
I need a word with
Dr. Hofstadter.

12:09.836 --> 12:11.186
Do you think it's appropriate

12:11.188 --> 12:13.722
for her to sit with us,
given her station?

12:14.707 --> 12:16.892
Given her what?

12:16.894 --> 12:20.145
If I've learned anything from
British television shows on PBS,

12:20.147 --> 12:24.983
it's that servants dine
downstairs with their own kind.

12:24.985 --> 12:27.769
What?

12:27.771 --> 12:30.271
It's a kindness, Leonard.

12:30.273 --> 12:33.041
Otherwise, you're cruelly
tempting them with a glimpse

12:33.043 --> 12:36.411
of a world that's just beyond
their soot-stained fingertips.

12:37.530 --> 12:39.447
Oh, sure.

12:39.449 --> 12:40.782
Please join us.

12:40.784 --> 12:44.169
Oh, okay. Thank you.

12:44.171 --> 12:45.971
So, Alex, what's the topic
of your dissertation?

12:45.973 --> 12:48.006
I'm looking
for Trojan asteroids

12:48.008 --> 12:49.574
at Earth's L-Five
Lagrange point.

12:49.576 --> 12:51.593
Oh, that happens to be

12:51.595 --> 12:53.729
Dr. Koothrappali's
field of expertise.

12:53.731 --> 12:56.431
You two have a lot
to talk about.

12:58.184 --> 12:59.952
Is that true?

13:01.000 --> 13:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:11.247 --> 13:12.647
Is he all right?

13:12.649 --> 13:14.866
No.

13:17.737 --> 13:22.507
But compared to your boss,
he's the poster boy for sanity.

13:22.509 --> 13:25.160
It's okay, I've been around
scientists all my life.

13:25.162 --> 13:26.878
My dad's an astronomer at SETI.

13:26.880 --> 13:30.349
Oh, SETI-- the Search for
Extraterrestrial Intelligence.

13:30.351 --> 13:33.051
You should introduce him
to Sheldon. The search is over.

13:33.053 --> 13:36.337
So, what kind of research
are you doing?

13:36.339 --> 13:37.589
High-energy lasers.

13:37.591 --> 13:38.774
Ooh. Military?

13:38.776 --> 13:40.776
Not yet, but I can remove
unwanted hair

13:40.778 --> 13:42.343
from two miles away.

13:44.347 --> 13:45.313
You were right.

13:45.315 --> 13:46.848
I had nothing
to worry about.

13:46.850 --> 13:49.051
That skank's your
problem, not mine.

13:49.886 --> 13:52.353
You're very funny,
Dr. Hofstadter.

13:52.355 --> 13:53.288
Thank you.

13:53.290 --> 13:55.857
Aah! Cherry stem!
Cherry stem!

13:59.078 --> 14:02.264
How you doing, Howie?
You feeling a little better?

14:02.266 --> 14:06.852
Oh, a lot better, thanks.
One sec.

14:07.870 --> 14:10.922
Listen close.
I don't have a lot of time.

14:10.924 --> 14:12.224
I need you to go to my house.

14:12.226 --> 14:14.559
In my bedroom, you'll find
a model rocket.

14:14.561 --> 14:17.479
I want you to take it
and bring it back to your place.

14:17.481 --> 14:19.114
Okay...

14:19.116 --> 14:22.350
Step two: Build a version
roughly 14 stories high.

14:23.436 --> 14:25.687
Fill it full of rocket fuel
and come get me.

14:25.689 --> 14:28.056
I'll leave the door unlocked.

14:30.893 --> 14:32.894
Howie, honey, maybe you should
talk to someone,

14:32.896 --> 14:35.197
let them know you're having
a little anxiety.

14:35.199 --> 14:36.998
No, no, I'm fine.

14:37.000 --> 14:39.000
No anxiety!

14:39.002 --> 14:41.069
We should probably talk in code.

14:41.071 --> 14:43.738
From now on, "frog" is me,
"sandwich" means you

14:43.740 --> 14:46.341
and "lemon" means rocket.
So, come on, sandwich,

14:46.343 --> 14:49.711
build me a lemon 'cause froggy
wants to come home!

14:54.917 --> 14:58.887
Look at you,
putting on a brave face.

14:58.889 --> 15:01.256
There's nothing
to be brave about.

15:01.258 --> 15:02.524
Everything's fine.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.142
Really?

15:04.144 --> 15:06.528
I don't know how much you know
about primate behavior,

15:06.530 --> 15:08.864
but Sheldon's assistant
was clearly courting Leonard.

15:10.399 --> 15:12.734
Were she a mandrill,
she would have bent over

15:12.736 --> 15:14.319
and displayed her brightly
colored hindquarters

15:14.321 --> 15:16.538
like a big red welcome mat.

15:17.974 --> 15:20.108
By the way, you try that
at the junior prom,

15:20.110 --> 15:21.827
you get kicked out.

15:23.629 --> 15:26.882
Okay, maybe she <i>was</i> flirting
with him, but who cares?

15:26.884 --> 15:28.049
Look, I don't even know

15:28.051 --> 15:29.918
where my relationship is
with Leonard is right now.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.087
So says your
prefrontal cortex.

15:32.089 --> 15:34.256
But meanwhile, the limbic system
of your brain is calculating

15:34.258 --> 15:37.008
that if another woman
is attracted to Leonard,

15:37.010 --> 15:38.343
it must be because
he's desirable.

15:38.345 --> 15:40.929
Well, of course
he's desirable.

15:40.931 --> 15:42.681
I mean, he's great.

15:42.683 --> 15:45.984
He's smart, he's sweet,
and, ooh, in the bedroom, whew,

15:45.986 --> 15:48.854
let me tell you,
he <i>really</i> tries.

15:51.307 --> 15:53.325
So it does bother you.

15:53.327 --> 15:55.977
Fine, it bothers
me a little.

15:55.979 --> 15:57.245
No. You know what?

15:57.247 --> 15:59.197
This is stupid.
It doesn't bother me.

16:00.783 --> 16:02.367
Okay, it bothers me.

16:03.336 --> 16:05.486
But only because she
wouldn't stop laughing.

16:05.488 --> 16:07.789
Leonard is not that funny.

16:09.125 --> 16:10.258
And there you have it;

16:10.260 --> 16:13.044
prefrontal cortex reasoning
versus limbic lust.

16:13.046 --> 16:15.430
If this were a boxing match,
they might call it

16:15.432 --> 16:19.334
"The thrilla adjacent
to the amygdala."

16:21.805 --> 16:23.188
If you were
a brain scientist,

16:23.190 --> 16:25.941
you would be busting
a gut right now!

16:29.629 --> 16:31.363
So, how was work today?

16:31.365 --> 16:33.148
Ah, it was
all right, I guess.

16:33.150 --> 16:36.301
Got to Heimlich a
cherry stem out of Sheldon.

16:36.303 --> 16:38.203
Caught Raj right in the eye.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.704
Oh!

16:40.640 --> 16:42.207
You're kidding.

16:42.209 --> 16:43.491
No, Raj had to go to the nurse.

16:43.493 --> 16:46.127
Wow. Anything else?

16:46.129 --> 16:50.799
Mmm, the nurse is a woman,
so he couldn't talk to her.

16:50.801 --> 16:52.700
She had to bring him
a Grover puppet

16:52.702 --> 16:54.869
so he could point at what hurt.

16:58.674 --> 17:00.292
Is that it?

17:00.294 --> 17:02.210
Isn't that enough?

17:02.212 --> 17:04.246
It had the weaponized fruit
and a puppet.

17:04.248 --> 17:06.181
What more do you want?

17:06.183 --> 17:09.550
Oh, good, Leonard, you're here.
Science news.

17:09.551 --> 17:12.436
This will interest you.
And, Penny, feel free

17:12.439 --> 17:13.855
to paint your nails.

17:15.223 --> 17:17.058
What do you got?

17:17.060 --> 17:18.526
I believe Alex may
have unearthed

17:18.528 --> 17:19.994
the grade school
science project

17:19.997 --> 17:22.230
that could be my ticket
to the Nobel Prize.

17:22.232 --> 17:23.198
Behold.

17:23.200 --> 17:26.367
"Magnets: What Do
They Stick To?"

17:27.869 --> 17:32.007
If the answer is "metal,"
it's not exactly groundbreaking.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.593
The original title was
"A Rederivation

17:34.595 --> 17:37.178
of Maxwell's Equations
Regarding Electromagnetism""

17:37.180 --> 17:39.965
I dumbed it down because some
of the more religious people

17:39.967 --> 17:42.583
in town were starting
to say I was a witch.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.422
Sheldon thinks the approach in
this paper might change the way

17:47.424 --> 17:48.923
we calculate ferromagnetic
hysteresis.

17:48.925 --> 17:51.893
Oh, it's about time.
I hated the old way.

17:53.279 --> 17:55.013
Hi. I'm Penny.
Alex.

17:55.015 --> 17:56.564
Uh, do you work
with Dr. Hofstadter?

17:56.566 --> 17:58.316
In a way.

18:00.503 --> 18:04.239
We've kind of been involved
in a five-year experiment.

18:04.241 --> 18:06.441
Oh. Well, you're lucky.
He seems very talented.

18:06.443 --> 18:09.277
And I'm sure a lot of people
want to work with him.

18:09.279 --> 18:12.447
Well, a lot of people can't.

18:12.449 --> 18:14.466
Uh, hey.

18:15.334 --> 18:16.468
Where are we going?

18:16.470 --> 18:19.721
My limbic system wants
to take your pants off.

18:22.441 --> 18:23.842
She seems nice.

18:23.844 --> 18:27.362
Notice people on your own time.
We're working.

18:36.582 --> 18:38.683
Hey, Howie, how you feeling?

18:38.685 --> 18:40.284
Better. Much better.

18:40.286 --> 18:43.671
The other astronauts
held me down,

18:43.673 --> 18:46.624
gave me a shot.

18:51.497 --> 18:54.098
Oh...

18:54.100 --> 18:57.668
Attention, people of Earth:

18:57.670 --> 19:02.873
Tonight, there will be <i>two</i> moons
in the sky.

19:04.259 --> 19:06.043
Howie, stop that.

19:06.045 --> 19:08.346
NASA's watching this!

19:08.348 --> 19:11.799
Put your pants back on!

19:11.801 --> 19:12.716
Whee! Whee!
